[00:00.000 --> 00:01.180]  You're a fool.
[00:02.340 --> 00:03.220]  Patreon exclusive!
[00:04.000 --> 00:04.040]  Hopefully...
[00:04.040 --> 00:05.060]  Is this one Patreon exclusive?
[00:06.940 --> 00:07.380]  Could be.
[00:07.400 --> 00:08.460]  I don't know. Could be.
[00:09.180 --> 00:09.620]  Hopefully...
[00:10.840 --> 00:13.660]  Now, are you guys seeing me?
[00:13.820 --> 00:14.640]  Or are you seeing yourself?
[00:14.680 --> 00:15.960]  I'm seeing Geoff.
[00:17.380 --> 00:18.800]  I don't see me.
[00:19.740 --> 00:20.180]  I see Geoff.
[00:20.560 --> 00:23.300]  It's Geoff. I'm watching Geoff.
[00:23.900 --> 00:24.600]  Oh yeah, it is Geoff.
[00:25.180 --> 00:26.700]  So when Andrew said...
[00:26.700 --> 00:28.760]  We had the same character!
[00:29.200 --> 00:30.340]  I didn't notice.
[00:30.660 --> 00:30.840]  Oh!
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.040]  That was crazy.
[00:34.600 --> 00:36.800]  This is like an iconic Achievement Hunter Let's Play game.
[00:36.900 --> 00:37.900]  I've never played this.
[00:38.340 --> 00:40.640]  That's why I want to play it with you. It's been fucking twelve years
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.340]  I've been trying to play this game.
[00:41.520 --> 00:44.880]  This was the go-to when I was out of town.
[00:45.220 --> 00:45.580]  Back in the day.
[00:47.200 --> 00:48.300]  Oh, what a shot.
[00:49.300 --> 00:50.400]  Watch out for the Skorps.
[00:50.920 --> 00:51.280]  Oh!
[00:52.080 --> 00:54.920]  Oh, son of a bitch, Skorp.
[00:55.480 --> 00:56.700]  What a bitch and a bastard.
[00:57.140 --> 00:58.860]  Oh, hey, I'm looking. Hey, check it out.
[00:58.880 --> 01:01.240]  I'm looking at Geoff's character.
[01:01.520 --> 01:03.320]  You forgot to count, motherfucker.
[01:03.540 --> 01:04.600]  I ain't taking this from you.
[01:04.760 --> 01:06.320]  Why don't you pick the same guy?
[01:08.180 --> 01:08.980]  Different clothes.
[01:09.140 --> 01:10.160]  There's Andrew Panton in the top.
[01:10.960 --> 01:11.600]  Uh-oh.
[01:13.380 --> 01:14.180]  It's looking good.
[01:14.840 --> 01:15.840]  Very few beans.
[01:17.500 --> 01:18.620]  Alright, here we go, Eric.
[01:18.800 --> 01:19.680]  Look at the heat waves.
[01:21.400 --> 01:22.620]  Yeah, it's a stinky hot day.
[01:22.620 --> 01:23.820]  Oh, tremendous.
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.820]  The Skorpion's gonna get it, too.
[01:26.880 --> 01:27.700]  He's a little bitch.
[01:28.540 --> 01:30.740]  I'm just gonna go ahead and put this motherfucker right in.
[01:32.040 --> 01:32.440]  Oh, shit.
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.680]  Yeah, look at you, dude. It's right in. Way to go.
[01:36.800 --> 01:37.900]  Fucking, here we go.
[01:38.280 --> 01:39.800]  Here we fucking go.
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.180]  This might be the original Fury game for me.
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.340]  What are you doing?
[01:45.640 --> 01:47.000]  Gavin, why did you do that?
[01:47.060 --> 01:48.720]  Did you think it was gonna go through him?
[01:49.160 --> 01:50.580]  He duped me.
[01:50.580 --> 01:52.580]  He came out of the way and then came back.
[01:52.940 --> 01:53.040]  No!
[01:54.560 --> 01:55.660]  Oh, he's coming at you.
[01:55.820 --> 01:57.140]  Oh, he's gonna fuck both of us.
[01:57.700 --> 02:00.840]  Oh, that's a par.
[02:02.040 --> 02:02.580]  That's right.
[02:03.300 --> 02:04.980]  I'm a rich bitch.
[02:06.420 --> 02:08.760]  I get my money and I know what I want.
[02:09.300 --> 02:10.020]  Don't make it.
[02:10.560 --> 02:11.980]  Get it, get it, get it!
[02:12.860 --> 02:14.360]  That's right, bogey bitches!
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.400]  I got a red shirt.
[02:17.520 --> 02:18.820]  Uh-oh, you'll be the first to die.
[02:18.820 --> 02:20.800]  You just went, ooh!
[02:26.280 --> 02:26.840]  Scorpion!
[02:27.840 --> 02:29.600]  Oh, the scorpion takes it away.
[02:29.920 --> 02:31.620]  Now I know why I never played this turd.
[02:34.720 --> 02:35.280]  Gotta be quick.
[02:36.120 --> 02:37.440]  Nobody's got power.
[02:41.200 --> 02:43.040]  Hotel Transylvania Sid lookin' ass.
[02:43.040 --> 02:43.960]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:45.200 --> 02:48.100]  I only put this down for nine holes.
[02:48.100 --> 02:49.520]  So we'll see how long it takes.
[02:49.600 --> 02:51.580]  It's too short, we'll just roll over.
[02:52.400 --> 02:53.640]  What did I hit there?
[02:53.740 --> 02:54.080]  You missed.
[02:56.480 --> 02:57.180]  Complications, apparently.
[02:57.380 --> 02:57.820]  Good strokes.
[02:58.680 --> 02:59.720]  What a start.
[03:01.300 --> 03:03.720]  This is cool, because this is how people used to dress.
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.420]  When this game came out.
[03:07.940 --> 03:09.280]  People don't dress like this anymore.
[03:10.160 --> 03:10.860]  There's a pony.
[03:11.460 --> 03:12.580]  Horses will eat the ball.
[03:12.840 --> 03:14.740]  Low-rise jeans are coming back, but they shouldn't.
[03:14.740 --> 03:15.600]  It's like a whole thing.
[03:16.680 --> 03:17.660]  Do I get chump cherry?
[03:18.980 --> 03:20.300]  Yeah, that's how golf works.
[03:20.980 --> 03:22.760]  This is the best golf game ever.
[03:22.840 --> 03:23.120]  Is it?
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.040]  How many beans did you give that one?
[03:26.880 --> 03:27.780]  Use it with me?
[03:28.380 --> 03:28.780]  Wow!
[03:30.380 --> 03:31.480]  When do I use that?
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.660]  When it's your turn, I think.
[03:33.720 --> 03:35.600]  Good work.
[03:39.160 --> 03:40.340]  You can go through the hut?
[03:40.480 --> 03:41.020]  Of course!
[03:42.060 --> 03:42.500]  Sausage.
[03:43.340 --> 03:43.640]  Snake, though.
[03:45.120 --> 03:46.400]  Watch out for this.
[03:48.540 --> 03:48.980]  Fuck!
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.000]  Oh, no!
[03:51.140 --> 03:52.200]  Who would have seen that coming?
[03:52.640 --> 03:54.060]  I guess you can't go through the house.
[03:54.780 --> 03:56.600]  I think you can if you get it low enough.
[03:56.820 --> 03:57.660]  God damn it.
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.460]  You just beamed the doors.
[04:00.640 --> 04:02.820]  I went too few beans last time.
[04:02.900 --> 04:04.540]  So I cranked the beans, and it was a mistake.
[04:05.760 --> 04:06.580]  Oh, here it goes.
[04:08.760 --> 04:09.640]  Both shielded.
[04:10.220 --> 04:11.880]  Just in case.
[04:12.120 --> 04:13.760]  Ain't no one gonna F with us.
[04:13.900 --> 04:14.840]  That's right, me and Gavin.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.220]  We're going schmee mode.
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.500]  Gavin sent me a video
[04:19.500 --> 04:21.180]  of the cat jumping on his dick the other day.
[04:21.260 --> 04:21.780]  It was very funny.
[04:22.120 --> 04:24.280]  It was around my stomach.
[04:24.460 --> 04:27.260]  He did it on purpose.
[04:27.520 --> 04:28.500]  A new Eminem song?
[04:30.540 --> 04:31.660]  You got this right here.
[04:32.000 --> 04:32.480]  Watch this.
[04:33.280 --> 04:33.720]  Nice!
[04:35.700 --> 04:37.980]  Whoa, is there a birdie in here?
[04:37.980 --> 04:39.660]  Oh my god.
[04:40.300 --> 04:41.020]  Alright, Andrew.
[04:42.220 --> 04:44.020]  Yeah, do it. You have to.
[04:44.620 --> 04:45.920]  What does the winner get?
[04:45.980 --> 04:46.380]  Free lunch?
[04:47.480 --> 04:49.700]  Oh, that's a good question.
[04:50.220 --> 04:50.800]  How about the viewer?
[04:51.660 --> 04:53.980]  Nah, it's gonna be the winner of the video.
[04:54.300 --> 04:56.280]  Oh, that almost kind of worked.
[04:56.720 --> 04:58.000]  You were really close, but now
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.740]  you're set up to fucking do it.
[05:00.520 --> 05:00.900]  Easy.
[05:02.580 --> 05:04.280]  Did you guys eat any lunch during our break?
[05:04.440 --> 05:06.440]  I had a little bit of caprese
[05:06.440 --> 05:07.980]  and I'm having a cup of coffee.
[05:08.060 --> 05:10.160]  If I do this, will it hit your ball or no?
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.280]  Find out.
[05:12.640 --> 05:14.400]  Did you have coffee this morning too?
[05:14.700 --> 05:14.860]  Yeah.
[05:15.640 --> 05:17.260]  You hit a second cup typically?
[05:18.500 --> 05:20.800]  Hey, so what I found
[05:20.800 --> 05:22.400]  is that there is ball collision
[05:22.400 --> 05:23.100]  in this.
[05:24.020 --> 05:26.540]  Yeah, I usually have a
[05:26.540 --> 05:28.220]  cup in the morning and a cup in the afternoon.
[05:28.940 --> 05:30.640]  Oh, I might start doing that.
[05:31.540 --> 05:32.860]  Afternoon cup really gets you there.
[05:34.160 --> 05:34.920]  Andrew's still committed
[05:34.920 --> 05:36.640]  to the saloon. Medium beans.
[05:36.820 --> 05:38.080]  That was too small on beans.
[05:38.240 --> 05:40.700]  That was too small on beans.
[05:41.180 --> 05:42.960]  Shit. Here comes a scorpion.
[05:43.380 --> 05:44.900]  No, no, stop.
[05:47.900 --> 05:48.300]  Beautiful.
[05:49.420 --> 05:51.160]  Gorgeous. Alright, next hole.
[05:51.800 --> 05:52.920]  Now that I'm looking at
[05:52.920 --> 05:54.380]  this house, I'm not seeing a way out.
[05:54.800 --> 05:56.860]  What do you mean? You have to. That's the way it goes.
[05:56.960 --> 05:58.900]  There might be a bog drain
[05:58.900 --> 06:01.040]  that spits you out. There's definitely shortcuts and stuff.
[06:01.040 --> 06:01.720]  I'm not lying.
[06:02.040 --> 06:04.760]  And then it goes boo and it shoots you right out.
[06:05.320 --> 06:06.120]  Oh, hell yeah.
[06:06.380 --> 06:09.020]  Hole in one. That's so cool.
[06:09.140 --> 06:10.160]  Way to go, bud. That was awesome.
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.140]  Geoff, you might be right about this game.
[06:13.400 --> 06:14.160]  It's a great game.
[06:15.360 --> 06:17.060]  I just wish there were more levels, but I think there's a
[06:17.060 --> 06:18.220]  sequel to it we can play as well.
[06:19.560 --> 06:19.900]  DLC?
[06:21.300 --> 06:22.060]  I don't know.
[06:22.220 --> 06:24.440]  There is DLC. I don't know how
[06:24.440 --> 06:26.160]  I think you can buy it.
[06:26.820 --> 06:29.240]  The big problem with the game as I remember
[06:29.240 --> 06:30.580]  it was that there was a
[06:30.580 --> 06:33.280]  we could only play it a few times because there were only so
[06:33.280 --> 06:33.760]  many levels.
[06:35.620 --> 06:37.180]  There's 36 holes in the game.
[06:38.800 --> 06:41.480]  So if we have nine, if we have 18
[06:41.480 --> 06:43.220]  holes, let's play as we play.
[06:43.360 --> 06:45.560]  What does that mean? Oh, can you go in the grave hole?
[06:45.740 --> 06:47.500]  You get a free shot. Yeah, I don't think you want to.
[06:47.740 --> 06:48.780]  Do you want to go in there?
[06:48.900 --> 06:49.580]  I don't think so.
[06:53.480 --> 06:55.020]  Yeah, going lost is the best.
[06:55.580 --> 06:56.020]  Oh, yeah.
[06:56.080 --> 06:57.420]  You got the spring.
[06:57.420 --> 06:59.980]  I tried to spring it.
[07:00.080 --> 07:01.680]  I tried to spring it to make sure I didn't do that
[07:01.680 --> 07:02.420]  and then I did it.
[07:02.700 --> 07:05.200]  And honestly, I looked embarrassed and that's sad.
[07:07.780 --> 07:09.140]  What the hell is this view?
[07:09.440 --> 07:10.760]  Yeah, what was your camera doing, dude?
[07:11.680 --> 07:12.300]  I don't know.
[07:15.400 --> 07:16.960]  We don't know what's going on.
[07:17.300 --> 07:19.580]  I don't think so. I think I just suck.
[07:20.940 --> 07:21.500]  There we go.
[07:21.700 --> 07:22.380]  You want that?
[07:23.280 --> 07:24.520]  Yeah, it's a spring right there. Spring it!
[07:24.520 --> 07:26.800]  Oh, shit. It's B, not A.
[07:27.800 --> 07:28.960]  I could have sprang.
[07:30.560 --> 07:32.320]  Spring could have sprung right there, baby.
[07:34.420 --> 07:36.480]  You got this. You got it. It's easy.
[07:37.060 --> 07:37.320]  Easy!
[07:38.940 --> 07:40.160]  Oh, very nice hit.
[07:40.480 --> 07:40.780]  Wow!
[07:43.580 --> 07:44.460]  Oh, fuck!
[07:44.920 --> 07:45.360]  Gorgeous!
[07:46.760 --> 07:48.220]  When do I get my free shot?
[07:49.620 --> 07:50.320]  Was that it?
[07:50.900 --> 07:51.560]  I don't know.
[07:51.560 --> 07:52.600]  Your first one didn't count.
[07:53.220 --> 07:54.380]  There we go.
[07:55.620 --> 07:57.480]  You've got to be kidding me.
[07:57.940 --> 07:58.440]  Oh!
[07:59.860 --> 08:00.920]  What a stop.
[08:01.900 --> 08:03.260]  Let's fucking try.
[08:03.440 --> 08:04.140]  Oh, Christ.
[08:04.440 --> 08:07.040]  Oh, Christ.
[08:07.120 --> 08:09.640]  Just hit that and bounce off and you'll be fine.
[08:10.300 --> 08:11.420]  Maybe the tree's the shortcut.
[08:11.940 --> 08:12.120]  Yeah.
[08:12.540 --> 08:13.800]  You got it right there.
[08:15.080 --> 08:15.840]  Look at that.
[08:16.880 --> 08:18.340]  Nice, dude. Way to go.
[08:18.340 --> 08:19.180]  Oh, that was close.
[08:20.780 --> 08:22.420]  You can go right over the rock, Geoff.
[08:23.020 --> 08:23.200]  Oh!
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.920]  You bent me, Geoff!
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.220]  Bull!
[08:31.940 --> 08:34.780]  And that's what makes this the best game.
[08:34.880 --> 08:35.180]  Oh, no.
[08:38.320 --> 08:39.220]  Too many beans.
[08:39.760 --> 08:42.500]  Oh, a lot of beans, bud.
[08:42.600 --> 08:42.780]  Yeah.
[08:44.040 --> 08:45.900]  All kinds of stuff going on.
[08:45.900 --> 08:46.560]  Shit.
[08:47.300 --> 08:47.860]  Keeping that spring?
[08:48.760 --> 08:49.720]  Keeping the spring.
[08:49.920 --> 08:51.440]  Oh, look at that. Andrew's lined up.
[08:51.980 --> 08:52.520]  And look at this.
[08:52.760 --> 08:59.740]  So your first stroke, it didn't count anything until that.
[08:59.900 --> 09:00.660]  So you got...
[09:00.660 --> 09:01.800]  That was a one-stroke play.
[09:02.340 --> 09:03.320]  I might be back in it.
[09:03.920 --> 09:04.480]  You might be.
[09:07.200 --> 09:07.740]  Fireball?
[09:08.320 --> 09:08.660]  Oh!
[09:09.820 --> 09:11.480]  I rimmed the hole.
[09:17.080 --> 09:18.500]  You got it.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.080]  More, more beans.
[09:22.020 --> 09:23.080]  Tactical free shot.
[09:23.360 --> 09:23.600]  Smart.
[09:23.920 --> 09:24.980]  Raid free shot.
[09:25.220 --> 09:25.940]  That was smart.
[09:28.320 --> 09:29.100]  You got that?
[09:29.140 --> 09:30.240]  That's your tactical free shot, too.
[09:32.880 --> 09:33.700]  Oh, you can spring it.
[09:34.280 --> 09:36.020]  I think there is...
[09:36.020 --> 09:38.040]  I think there is a shortcut,
[09:38.300 --> 09:39.240]  like the first level.
[09:39.960 --> 09:41.760]  But the spring didn't do spring!
[09:42.060 --> 09:44.300]  Hey, Geoff, I just want to point out
[09:44.300 --> 09:46.100]  that Gavin didn't have the spring when he did that.
[09:46.940 --> 09:48.280]  Where did my spring happen?
[09:48.580 --> 09:49.820]  Did you see me spring?
[09:50.160 --> 09:51.460]  No, I think you lose it.
[09:51.460 --> 09:52.340]  I think it went away.
[09:53.240 --> 09:55.700]  If you get something else over it...
[09:55.700 --> 09:56.700]  What did I get over it?
[09:56.760 --> 09:57.200]  Nothing?
[09:59.020 --> 10:01.400]  I'm not in charge of your fucking power-ups.
[10:02.780 --> 10:04.660]  Geoff, can you be in charge of Gavin's power-ups?
[10:05.660 --> 10:06.380]  I'll start.
[10:08.620 --> 10:09.060]  Nice.
[10:11.940 --> 10:12.900]  There's your free shot.
[10:12.900 --> 10:14.540]  There you go.
[10:15.440 --> 10:16.480]  It's easy.
[10:16.880 --> 10:17.160]  Yep.
[10:18.060 --> 10:19.160]  Not enough beans.
[10:20.220 --> 10:22.680]  I was just trying to get that free shot.
[10:23.320 --> 10:24.040]  Perfect.
[10:24.300 --> 10:26.560]  That's a shit shot.
[10:26.880 --> 10:27.740]  I don't know about that.
[10:28.160 --> 10:29.100]  That's terrible.
[10:30.100 --> 10:31.600]  Tossin' bastards.
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.200]  Toss!
[10:35.560 --> 10:38.940]  Have you ever played minigolf before?
[10:41.160 --> 10:41.600]  Jesus.
[10:44.900 --> 10:47.300]  This guy trying to shoot it through the okay corral.
[10:48.220 --> 10:49.220]  Suddenly caught up.
[10:49.340 --> 10:50.060]  You ever played minigolf?
[10:51.900 --> 10:54.220]  I've shot better shots off my own back
[10:54.220 --> 10:55.560]  than I'm doing right now.
[10:55.700 --> 10:56.420]  Get in there.
[10:56.940 --> 10:58.280]  You did what off your what?
[10:58.480 --> 10:59.680]  You did what off your back?
[11:00.180 --> 11:02.740]  He did back shots off of Michael or something.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.620]  No, I dressed as Turf.
[11:04.700 --> 11:06.800]  I put the ball on my own back and I got it.
[11:07.380 --> 11:08.860]  I heard you rimmed the hole.
[11:10.700 --> 11:12.100]  I'm pretty sure that's what he said, right?
[11:12.140 --> 11:12.980]  Yeah, something like that.
[11:14.460 --> 11:16.280]  I wasn't really paying attention, but I think that's right.
[11:20.380 --> 11:20.700]  Okay.
[11:23.540 --> 11:25.180]  So we gotta get it in the hole, huh?
[11:25.940 --> 11:27.020]  So you can see to the right
[11:27.020 --> 11:27.900]  there is a little...
[11:27.900 --> 11:30.680]  I think it's the...
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  I think the snake
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.920]  if you get too close to it, it might fuck with you.
[11:34.920 --> 11:35.520]  I don't remember.
[11:35.840 --> 11:36.980]  Here comes Scorponox.
[11:37.620 --> 11:38.680]  You okay back there, Gavin?
[11:39.360 --> 11:39.760]  Yeah.
[11:41.060 --> 11:41.960]  You sure about that?
[11:42.600 --> 11:42.900]  No.
[11:47.400 --> 11:48.040]  Get that one.
[11:48.160 --> 11:49.220]  Damn it. I wanted that.
[11:49.460 --> 11:50.360]  That's a good one.
[11:50.360 --> 11:51.820]  Is that a zappy punch?
[11:52.820 --> 11:53.660]  That's what I want.
[11:54.020 --> 11:56.760]  That's why I'm positioned myself right there with it.
[11:57.100 --> 11:58.300]  Watch out for Scorponox.
[11:59.660 --> 12:01.920]  Why didn't I get to go first if I suck the most?
[12:01.920 --> 12:02.500]  I don't know.
[12:02.560 --> 12:05.600]  You definitely do suck the most.
[12:10.720 --> 12:15.060]  Did I say Michael?
[12:15.240 --> 12:16.100]  I didn't see anyone's name.
[12:16.840 --> 12:17.960]  What are you talking about?
[12:42.160 --> 12:45.340]  I'm so glad we can keep doing this.
[12:48.200 --> 12:51.620]  I'd be really sad if we didn't get to keep doing this.
[12:53.960 --> 12:54.500]  Beans!
[12:55.100 --> 12:56.080]  Summer 2012.
[12:57.880 --> 12:58.880]  That's a lot of beans.
[12:58.880 --> 13:00.300]  Do it!
[13:09.100 --> 13:10.620]  That was great.
[13:10.840 --> 13:12.360]  You went so far.
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.600]  Where even am I?
[13:21.080 --> 13:22.080]  That's great.
[13:22.300 --> 13:23.900]  Did you just dismiss me out of the map?
[13:24.140 --> 13:25.040]  I don't know.
[13:28.880 --> 13:31.140]  I can't wait to see where you end up.
[13:31.560 --> 13:33.060]  I thought you'd think I'd get to go again.
[13:33.140 --> 13:33.700]  I just out.
[13:35.440 --> 13:36.500]  What a shot!
[13:37.800 --> 13:38.200]  Wow.
[13:39.720 --> 13:42.260]  I think I see another reason why Geoff wanted to play this game.
[13:44.180 --> 13:45.680]  You're not that far back.
[13:45.760 --> 13:46.320]  You're good.
[13:46.540 --> 13:47.200]  That could have been worse.
[13:48.600 --> 13:50.980]  You can probably even take that shortcut if you shoot up to the right.
[13:52.880 --> 13:53.380]  Shut up.
[13:53.380 --> 13:54.500]  Holy shit.
[13:57.500 --> 13:58.300]  Hell yeah.
[13:59.300 --> 14:00.700]  See, Geoff's in charge of your power-ups.
[14:02.300 --> 14:03.400]  I was a bit out of range there.
[14:08.460 --> 14:10.040]  You're pretty in range there though.
[14:13.040 --> 14:14.680]  You can't use it right now, can you?
[14:15.580 --> 14:15.980]  No.
[14:17.160 --> 14:18.380]  How do I use it?
[14:19.160 --> 14:20.580]  What the fuck was that?
[14:20.580 --> 14:20.920]  Boom.
[14:22.240 --> 14:24.740]  I think it hit the little awning thing.
[14:25.140 --> 14:26.580]  You can use it right now, can't you?
[14:27.140 --> 14:27.880]  I'm gonna die.
[14:29.180 --> 14:30.860]  It didn't go off!
[14:31.840 --> 14:32.900]  I'm sub-shit!
[14:36.220 --> 14:38.220]  I'm blooples in myself.
[14:38.560 --> 14:40.380]  Fucking awning. That sucks.
[14:40.700 --> 14:41.080]  No!
[14:46.980 --> 14:48.160]  It's in the hole.
[14:48.160 --> 14:49.320]  Good putt, Eric.
[14:49.320 --> 14:52.400]  I cannot tell you how good it feels to play this game without Ray.
[14:58.800 --> 14:59.640]  Double bogey.
[14:59.840 --> 15:00.080]  Damn.
[15:01.480 --> 15:02.500]  Where are we at? Hang on.
[15:02.700 --> 15:06.000]  So it's Geoff at zero. Gavin's at plus six.
[15:10.480 --> 15:12.380]  Plenty of time.
[15:14.140 --> 15:15.360]  Climb the ladder?
[15:16.460 --> 15:17.840]  Oh, you got bombs?
[15:18.120 --> 15:18.920]  Oh, shit.
[15:20.080 --> 15:20.800]  There's bombs.
[15:22.200 --> 15:23.180]  Alright, Geoff, what do you got?
[15:24.200 --> 15:25.040]  I don't know, man.
[15:25.260 --> 15:25.600]  Oh, wow.
[15:28.500 --> 15:28.840]  Sure.
[15:30.720 --> 15:31.300]  Oh, good.
[15:32.080 --> 15:32.440]  Uh...
[15:33.240 --> 15:34.020]  What do you got?
[15:36.420 --> 15:37.460]  Where are you gonna shoot?
[15:37.460 --> 15:39.240]  Oh, you can do that. You can hit Geoff with it.
[15:39.640 --> 15:39.720]  Now.
[15:41.400 --> 15:42.060]  Where's the O?
[15:42.060 --> 15:43.240]  Oh, no.
[15:43.620 --> 15:44.780]  Is it not around it?
[15:44.860 --> 15:45.800]  No, it's up top.
[15:45.940 --> 15:48.480]  How did you win a mini-golf reality show?
[15:54.320 --> 15:55.880]  They got to look at the hole.
[15:57.040 --> 15:57.920]  I think other people
[15:57.920 --> 15:59.900]  wanted to stop filming, so...
[15:59.900 --> 16:00.780]  They just went home.
[16:00.800 --> 16:02.700]  I'll tell you how he won.
[16:03.800 --> 16:05.700]  Blaine completely disintegrated
[16:05.700 --> 16:07.040]  as a human being that day.
[16:07.960 --> 16:09.920]  I have never seen
[16:09.920 --> 16:11.540]  someone crack under pressure like that.
[16:12.420 --> 16:13.660]  I tried to give him a few as well.
[16:14.220 --> 16:15.820]  I know, and he knew you did.
[16:16.060 --> 16:17.640]  And he still couldn't pull it together.
[16:18.520 --> 16:19.760]  What is blowhole?
[16:20.260 --> 16:22.220]  What did he say?
[16:22.420 --> 16:22.860]  Blowhole?
[16:25.020 --> 16:26.240]  Uh... I don't remember.
[16:26.520 --> 16:28.000]  Maybe it shoots people away from the hole.
[16:29.200 --> 16:29.640]  Maybe.
[16:30.740 --> 16:31.180]  Oh!
[16:33.440 --> 16:33.880]  Right.
[16:33.980 --> 16:35.140]  That's all you're supposed to do?
[16:36.220 --> 16:36.480]  Yeah.
[16:36.480 --> 16:36.900]  Oh.
[16:39.040 --> 16:39.560]  What?
[16:39.900 --> 16:42.540]  Okay, let's think about this.
[16:44.440 --> 16:44.960]  Let's...
[16:44.960 --> 16:46.320]  You can use this
[16:46.320 --> 16:47.040]  and zap him.
[16:48.280 --> 16:50.840]  Yeah, just hit B as soon as you hit the ball.
[16:51.160 --> 16:52.020]  I tried that last time.
[16:52.340 --> 16:54.000]  Try harder this time.
[16:55.180 --> 16:55.320]  Yeah.
[16:56.280 --> 16:58.060]  Oh, no!
[16:58.880 --> 16:59.320]  Oh!
[17:00.800 --> 17:01.320]  Oh.
[17:02.200 --> 17:04.080]  Oh, you hit the barrel and it blew up.
[17:06.800 --> 17:08.020]  Oh, I do like it, actually.
[17:08.160 --> 17:09.440]  Wow, that is pretty lined up.
[17:09.460 --> 17:10.300]  That's where you landed?
[17:11.440 --> 17:13.180]  Get blowhole. I don't know what it does.
[17:16.960 --> 17:18.020]  What the fuck was that?
[17:18.380 --> 17:18.740]  Bark!
[17:18.880 --> 17:21.200]  I think it sucks you into the hole, maybe.
[17:22.540 --> 17:22.920]  Oh, wow.
[17:23.280 --> 17:25.580]  It either sucks you in or blows people away.
[17:25.720 --> 17:26.900]  Oh, that was close.
[17:27.720 --> 17:28.340]  Thanks, Gavin.
[17:29.460 --> 17:29.560]  Yeah.
[17:32.360 --> 17:32.820]  I don't...
[17:34.380 --> 17:36.020]  Okay. Great.
[17:37.760 --> 17:40.760]  I feel like Blaine right now. I'm falling apart.
[17:44.220 --> 17:45.500]  Get me out of here.
[17:45.860 --> 17:46.480]  Nice.
[17:47.660 --> 17:49.840]  I thought it was going to fail you.
[17:50.320 --> 17:51.740]  This is going to be bad, fellas.
[17:52.860 --> 17:53.660]  For who?
[17:54.840 --> 17:55.940]  Me, you dunce.
[17:58.140 --> 17:59.240]  There you go. Perfect.
[17:59.920 --> 18:01.480]  Now you're perfectly lined up.
[18:01.780 --> 18:03.580]  Would it be politically incorrect
[18:03.580 --> 18:05.380]  to sell a regulation dunce cap?
[18:08.100 --> 18:09.240]  I think we could do it.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.220]  I'm calling my daddy. I don't like this.
[18:13.780 --> 18:13.960]  What?
[18:15.960 --> 18:16.800]  Oh, what was the score?
[18:16.920 --> 18:18.020]  I don't... Who gives a fuck?
[18:19.300 --> 18:19.660]  Oh.
[18:20.620 --> 18:21.820]  Oh no, Eric. What happened?
[18:24.200 --> 18:25.800]  Wow, that looks like a twisty dick.
[18:26.320 --> 18:27.220]  Look, it's blowhole.
[18:28.300 --> 18:29.720]  I'm going to get me some blow.
[18:32.620 --> 18:34.360]  Can I just put it down?
[18:36.180 --> 18:36.700]  Okay.
[18:38.440 --> 18:38.900]  Right.
[18:39.220 --> 18:39.880]  Please go right.
[18:40.400 --> 18:44.120]  It looks like I just shat my bowl out my eye.
[18:47.220 --> 18:48.980]  I have everyone's bowl poo.
[18:49.660 --> 18:51.040]  Oh, that's so funny.
[18:51.340 --> 18:51.880]  You're right here.
[18:52.180 --> 18:54.440]  You're further behind.
[18:57.220 --> 18:59.440]  Look at Andrew machinimating.
[19:05.180 --> 19:05.880]  That's nice.
[19:06.180 --> 19:08.820]  The bar was pretty low.
[19:10.980 --> 19:11.440]  Nice.
[19:13.060 --> 19:14.260]  That's right.
[19:18.350 --> 19:19.770]  See, he's behind you.
[19:21.090 --> 19:23.170]  This is so funny.
[19:24.730 --> 19:25.190]  Oh.
[19:25.190 --> 19:26.030]  Damn it.
[19:29.610 --> 19:30.890]  That was close.
[19:31.030 --> 19:33.230]  So vacuum hole is just activated upon pick up.
[19:34.770 --> 19:35.830]  Appears to be.
[19:36.990 --> 19:39.730]  So if you get enough beans, you can really get it up there.
[19:39.930 --> 19:41.250]  And then like...
[19:41.930 --> 19:42.390]  Yeah.
[19:43.030 --> 19:44.510]  Did you? Hang on.
[19:45.010 --> 19:45.790]  Hang on.
[19:47.030 --> 19:48.150]  What was that?
[19:48.390 --> 19:49.270]  Wait a second.
[19:51.010 --> 19:51.790]  Oh no.
[19:51.790 --> 19:53.110]  Did you use the electricity?
[19:53.470 --> 19:53.770]  No!
[19:54.510 --> 19:55.070]  Oh my god.
[19:56.950 --> 20:01.090]  He moved a half a foot because you knocked him off the course.
[20:02.150 --> 20:04.930]  It put him back to the regular starting position.
[20:05.550 --> 20:07.170]  Oh, you killed me?
[20:07.290 --> 20:07.630]  Yes.
[20:08.670 --> 20:10.290]  Where did you even get power up from?
[20:11.850 --> 20:13.470]  Did you have that from last time?
[20:13.930 --> 20:15.590]  No, I picked it up in front of you.
[20:15.690 --> 20:16.530]  Oh god.
[20:17.290 --> 20:18.230]  That was fucking great.
[20:19.050 --> 20:19.410]  Action.
[20:20.210 --> 20:21.730]  I picked it up and used it.
[20:23.230 --> 20:24.570]  You can use it right now.
[20:24.670 --> 20:25.570]  Look at that.
[20:27.130 --> 20:27.750]  What a shot.
[20:28.270 --> 20:29.310]  You might have gotten blowhole.
[20:30.770 --> 20:31.190]  Oh, did I?
[20:31.510 --> 20:33.030]  Yeah, the second one might have been blowhole.
[20:34.290 --> 20:35.010]  Oh no!
[20:35.810 --> 20:37.710]  Yeah, you got blown the fuck up, bud.
[20:37.710 --> 20:39.770]  Oh no.
[20:48.270 --> 20:50.450]  Did you activate bomb?
[20:50.730 --> 20:51.390]  Oh my god.
[20:54.670 --> 20:54.750]  No!
[20:56.470 --> 20:58.870]  You bastard.
[21:03.310 --> 21:05.170]  Fuck yes.
[21:11.070 --> 21:12.890]  Oh yeah, suck me in.
[21:14.290 --> 21:15.150]  There it is.
[21:15.890 --> 21:16.450]  Wow.
[21:17.610 --> 21:20.910]  You knocking me off is the only reason I got power on that level.
[21:24.750 --> 21:25.310]  Shit.
[21:25.730 --> 21:26.490]  That was lucky.
[21:29.230 --> 21:32.430]  I get what blowhole and suckhole are now.
[21:32.430 --> 21:33.850]  Oh man, I suck.
[21:40.070 --> 21:41.950]  What do I have? Nothing.
[21:42.250 --> 21:43.550]  So Gavin, here's the thing.
[21:43.970 --> 21:46.750]  The thing to your right, I think, is blowhole.
[21:47.130 --> 21:49.570]  Which you won't be able to get in.
[21:49.770 --> 21:53.690]  But it will definitely knock that other ball way far away from the hole right there.
[21:54.110 --> 21:57.110]  I'm pretty sure that's what we're looking at with that power up to your right.
[21:57.650 --> 21:58.850]  What about this barrel?
[21:58.990 --> 21:59.750]  You can just sink it.
[21:59.750 --> 22:00.670]  Yeah, try that.
[22:01.190 --> 22:03.050]  Or you can just sink it.
[22:03.330 --> 22:05.370]  Oh yeah, if you just want to sink it.
[22:05.410 --> 22:07.810]  I mean, you're not lined up, so...
[22:08.390 --> 22:09.650]  Holy shit!
[22:10.890 --> 22:12.230]  That was awesome.
[22:12.410 --> 22:14.030]  That was so cool.
[22:16.670 --> 22:17.870]  Wow, that was awesome.
[22:19.050 --> 22:19.530]  Wow.
[22:20.190 --> 22:21.770]  Not enough beans?
[22:23.330 --> 22:23.930]  Oh, get it.
[22:24.670 --> 22:25.370]  Oh, you...
[22:26.230 --> 22:27.110]  You had it.
[22:28.030 --> 22:28.430]  Fuck.
[22:30.270 --> 22:31.150]  Sand trap now?
[22:32.230 --> 22:32.450]  Yep.
[22:33.450 --> 22:35.550]  Oh yeah, there's a little chute there that lands right in the hole.
[22:35.590 --> 22:36.870]  You gotta give it...
[22:36.870 --> 22:38.450]  a bunch to get out of that sand.
[22:38.690 --> 22:39.150]  It's tough.
[22:42.130 --> 22:43.210]  Why in the world?
[22:43.890 --> 22:45.590]  Oh, no.
[22:46.050 --> 22:46.990]  Why would you go for that?
[22:48.230 --> 22:49.350]  I didn't know I could
[22:49.350 --> 22:50.370]  shoot it out of the course.
[22:50.930 --> 22:51.870]  Right, no, but...
[22:51.870 --> 22:54.850]  Right, but I'm asking, why would you go for this?
[22:54.850 --> 22:56.390]  Why do you want blowhole?
[22:57.650 --> 22:58.810]  You want suckhole.
[22:58.990 --> 23:00.530]  I hear good things about it.
[23:06.330 --> 23:07.290]  Good shot.
[23:07.630 --> 23:08.430]  Yeah, plus four.
[23:10.650 --> 23:11.830]  Let's have a look at the score.
[23:13.530 --> 23:14.850]  Geoff at zero.
[23:15.550 --> 23:16.550]  Gavin's at seven.
[23:16.670 --> 23:18.630]  Andrew's plus five. Eric's plus four.
[23:20.030 --> 23:21.150]  I'm a back three guy.
[23:21.990 --> 23:23.570]  When he had that eagle...
[23:23.570 --> 23:24.750]  The free shot.
[23:25.850 --> 23:28.110]  Blowing and sucking and doing all sorts of stuff.
[23:28.330 --> 23:28.530]  Yeah.
[23:30.170 --> 23:31.330]  Oh, look at that.
[23:31.450 --> 23:32.850]  Look at the right side, dude.
[23:35.690 --> 23:37.290]  Look at those girths.
[23:37.490 --> 23:38.730]  Look at these fucking rats in here.
[23:40.370 --> 23:41.310]  Straight out of the hole.
[23:41.670 --> 23:42.610]  Nice shot.
[23:43.030 --> 23:43.470]  I'll take it.
[23:44.650 --> 23:46.890]  I needed that. I have some ground I need to cover.
[23:47.490 --> 23:48.150]  Yeah, I get it.
[23:49.810 --> 23:50.610]  Prairie dogs.
[23:50.610 --> 23:51.250]  No.
[23:53.250 --> 23:54.010]  Too much.
[23:54.710 --> 23:56.310]  There were some prairie dogs at the beach when I went there.
[23:57.050 --> 23:57.830]  Electric shotgun.
[23:58.090 --> 23:59.230]  I feel good about the electric shotgun.
[24:03.750 --> 24:05.050]  Not taking the chance.
[24:05.130 --> 24:06.290]  Are you taking the chance?
[24:06.550 --> 24:08.390]  You got to.
[24:08.850 --> 24:09.550]  Too many beams.
[24:11.370 --> 24:12.850]  It's less beams than you think.
[24:15.110 --> 24:15.870]  That's in the water.
[24:15.930 --> 24:17.190]  Oh, we all needed that.
[24:17.850 --> 24:18.110]  Oops.
[24:18.110 --> 24:18.390]  Oops.
[24:22.050 --> 24:24.010]  Gavin not even chancing it.
[24:24.310 --> 24:25.590]  Well, I won the stuff.
[24:26.110 --> 24:26.710]  Oh, okay.
[24:27.430 --> 24:28.330]  Gavin's a collector.
[24:29.130 --> 24:29.810]  Oh, a shield.
[24:33.030 --> 24:35.570]  That also worked out surprisingly well.
[24:35.770 --> 24:36.810]  That's unbelievable.
[24:38.390 --> 24:38.870]  Alright.
[24:39.310 --> 24:40.670]  Almost blocked me.
[24:40.670 --> 24:40.730]  Yeah.
[24:44.450 --> 24:44.950]  Okay.
[24:46.730 --> 24:47.610]  I'll take heart.
[24:47.810 --> 24:48.650]  Eric tested that earlier.
[24:52.090 --> 24:53.330]  Here we go.
[24:54.650 --> 24:55.330]  You got this, Eric.
[24:56.390 --> 24:57.530]  Be sure to give it enough beams.
[24:59.270 --> 25:00.430]  He got the shield.
[25:00.690 --> 25:01.550]  But I had to see anyway.
[25:02.550 --> 25:03.470]  You suck!
[25:06.090 --> 25:09.070]  But I've activated, so I feel good about it.
[25:10.210 --> 25:11.530]  Oh, is that just on now?
[25:13.810 --> 25:13.870]  Shield!
[25:14.970 --> 25:15.890]  Oh, never mind.
[25:16.310 --> 25:17.010]  He shielded up.
[25:21.730 --> 25:22.930]  Prairie dogs are scared.
[25:23.230 --> 25:23.910]  They're prairie dogging.
[25:24.390 --> 25:26.570]  What just happened?
[25:27.050 --> 25:28.010]  What the hell's going on?
[25:28.290 --> 25:29.030]  That was fast.
[25:29.150 --> 25:30.270]  I'll say you went the wrong way.
[25:30.370 --> 25:31.450]  I think your shield wore off.
[25:33.630 --> 25:36.030]  What am I doing, though?
[25:36.870 --> 25:38.290]  Was that my turn?
[25:38.290 --> 25:39.750]  I don't know. Can you hit any buttons?
[25:40.210 --> 25:41.010]  Can you hit?
[25:42.090 --> 25:44.110]  My camera's, like, centered around the ball.
[25:47.290 --> 25:49.010]  We're gonna need a pad for this game.
[25:49.830 --> 25:51.790]  Are the developers still active on it?
[25:52.190 --> 25:53.690]  Alright, man. Whenever you're ready, go for it.
[25:54.290 --> 25:55.350]  You got this.
[25:55.830 --> 25:57.170]  How do I see what way I'm aiming?
[25:57.330 --> 25:59.090]  Just give it enough beams.
[26:00.070 --> 26:01.050]  You got it.
[26:01.370 --> 26:03.110]  Go ahead.
[26:03.590 --> 26:04.830]  Son of a bitch!
[26:04.830 --> 26:06.830]  I just teleported over there!
[26:09.030 --> 26:10.130]  Oh, I got it!
[26:10.710 --> 26:17.210]  That was great.
[26:20.630 --> 26:22.510]  That was my best opening shot ever.
[26:24.110 --> 26:25.730]  Not your best closing shot.
[26:25.830 --> 26:26.530]  No, definitely not.
[26:28.090 --> 26:29.330]  Oh, God.
[26:32.170 --> 26:32.810]  Frustrating.
[26:34.370 --> 26:34.830]  Roll!
[26:35.990 --> 26:37.190]  Hey, you're back where you were.
[26:37.510 --> 26:38.710]  That's a great spot to be in.
[26:38.710 --> 26:40.050]  That's a great spot.
[26:41.770 --> 26:43.030]  It feels like home, you know?
[26:50.890 --> 26:51.930]  Gavin's all fucked up.
[26:52.010 --> 26:53.150]  He's blowing out his suck hole
[26:53.150 --> 26:54.510]  and sucking out his blowing hole.
[26:55.750 --> 26:56.770]  He's in it.
[26:58.530 --> 26:59.450]  Oh, Gavin!
[27:01.090 --> 27:02.010]  Gavin, it's...
[27:02.010 --> 27:03.770]  What you didn't consider is the beams.
[27:05.950 --> 27:07.410]  Gavin, it's the beams.
[27:08.810 --> 27:10.270]  Don't worry, you got ten inch ones.
[27:10.350 --> 27:10.790]  You'll be fine.
[27:13.850 --> 27:15.730]  Gavin's there in one stroke!
[27:16.030 --> 27:17.670]  That's pretty good. Plus four's pretty cool.
[27:17.750 --> 27:18.470]  Let's check that score.
[27:19.270 --> 27:21.450]  Geoff at plus one, Andrew at plus five,
[27:21.570 --> 27:23.350]  Eric at plus five, Gavin at plus eleven.
[27:24.290 --> 27:25.250]  Gavin, stop!
[27:25.330 --> 27:26.930]  Everybody could melt down.
[27:26.930 --> 27:27.550]  It's alright.
[27:29.110 --> 27:30.070]  Yeah, stop!
[27:30.250 --> 27:31.250]  Why don't you start melting?
[27:34.130 --> 27:35.110]  I'll start melting
[27:35.110 --> 27:36.350]  as soon as you start blowing.
[27:37.490 --> 27:38.450]  Buddy, my...
[27:38.990 --> 27:40.770]  Take a shot with my ball six meters
[27:40.770 --> 27:41.810]  away from my guy.
[27:43.030 --> 27:44.550]  Oh, what the fuck?
[27:44.990 --> 27:45.810]  There's water!
[27:45.910 --> 27:48.590]  Hey guys, be careful. There's no guardrails there.
[27:49.750 --> 27:50.350]  Oh...
[27:52.930 --> 27:53.530]  Oh...
[27:56.230 --> 27:57.910]  Wow, what a shot!
[28:00.750 --> 28:02.310]  You really couldn't
[28:02.310 --> 28:03.230]  have Geoff do that.
[28:04.030 --> 28:05.010]  That's the problem.
[28:05.530 --> 28:06.950]  That was really impressive.
[28:08.610 --> 28:10.150]  Is that why you announced instead of
[28:10.150 --> 28:10.690]  played, Geoff?
[28:11.630 --> 28:12.710]  I'm sorry, what happened?
[28:13.610 --> 28:14.950]  Yeah, I was too good.
[28:15.890 --> 28:17.170]  No, I...
[28:18.050 --> 28:18.570]  My...
[28:18.570 --> 28:20.370]  I have a deep hatred of
[28:20.370 --> 28:21.890]  golf video games.
[28:23.710 --> 28:24.490]  Fireball, do it!
[28:25.190 --> 28:25.350]  Oh!
[28:26.970 --> 28:28.810]  Wait, is that just there now?
[28:29.290 --> 28:30.950]  Ha ha ha!
[28:32.550 --> 28:34.130]  I didn't know what it does.
[28:35.390 --> 28:37.270]  I'm glad you really figured it out
[28:37.270 --> 28:37.910]  really well.
[28:37.990 --> 28:38.570]  It does bad!
[28:40.910 --> 28:42.430]  Maybe he put out the flames.
[28:43.750 --> 28:44.650]  Don't worry, Geoff's got it.
[28:48.020 --> 28:48.500]  Nice!
[28:49.120 --> 28:49.660]  Yeah, way to go, man.
[28:50.320 --> 28:51.420]  Back to zero, huh?
[28:51.480 --> 28:52.560]  Back to par, yeah.
[28:54.100 --> 28:55.180]  I'm a regulation guy.
[28:56.100 --> 28:57.440]  Oh, that's rough.
[28:57.740 --> 28:58.240]  Oh, Gavin.
[28:59.260 --> 29:00.580]  You're gonna have to bank that.
[29:01.740 --> 29:03.400]  Just don't hit my ball.
[29:03.860 --> 29:04.180]  Just bank it.
[29:06.900 --> 29:07.860]  Okay, great.
[29:08.540 --> 29:09.020]  Phenomenal.
[29:10.800 --> 29:11.760]  Just to keep you updated,
[29:11.900 --> 29:13.780]  Gavin, you don't currently have a power-up.
[29:13.780 --> 29:15.400]  Thank you.
[29:15.900 --> 29:17.140]  Empty pocket prick.
[29:18.100 --> 29:19.780]  That's what they call me.
[29:20.640 --> 29:21.460]  It's in the hole.
[29:22.120 --> 29:22.460]  Damn.
[29:24.640 --> 29:25.980]  Needed some more beans.
[29:26.220 --> 29:27.240]  Yeah, just a little bit more.
[29:30.680 --> 29:31.920]  Should we make the final hole
[29:31.920 --> 29:32.700]  more interesting?
[29:33.200 --> 29:35.480]  What does that mean?
[29:36.240 --> 29:37.020]  Put some money on it?
[29:37.300 --> 29:39.180]  I forgot that I had a power-up. Geoff didn't help me.
[29:40.060 --> 29:40.840]  Put lunch on it.
[29:41.500 --> 29:41.760]  Oh!
[29:43.300 --> 29:44.100]  I mean...
[29:44.100 --> 29:46.260]  Do you guys...
[29:50.760 --> 29:52.220]  Best score on the final hole
[29:52.220 --> 29:53.980]  I'll do, because I think Geoff has this won.
[29:54.840 --> 29:55.600]  Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[29:56.220 --> 29:58.140]  I don't want to draw too much attention to myself.
[29:59.600 --> 30:00.780]  What is it gonna do?
[30:02.640 --> 30:04.160]  I want to fly under the radar.
[30:05.180 --> 30:05.820]  And then I've won
[30:06.380 --> 30:07.560]  without anybody realizing it.
[30:07.640 --> 30:09.020]  Gavin's at, like, plus 14.
[30:09.020 --> 30:10.820]  What are you talking about?
[30:11.160 --> 30:12.940]  Yeah, but...
[30:12.940 --> 30:14.380]  Geoff, are you capable of that kind of meltdown?
[30:15.100 --> 30:15.800]  Yeah, man!
[30:18.180 --> 30:19.320]  It's been documented
[30:19.320 --> 30:20.820]  for fucking 21 years.
[30:21.100 --> 30:22.880]  Geoff's at 0, Andrew at 5,
[30:23.120 --> 30:25.660]  Eric's at plus 6, and Gavin's at plus 12.
[30:26.840 --> 30:27.420]  Oh, boy.
[30:27.720 --> 30:29.080]  So if I just 1-1 this, it's over.
[30:29.200 --> 30:29.620]  Yeah, here we go.
[30:30.200 --> 30:31.300]  Let's do it.
[30:37.520 --> 30:38.020]  Spring?
[30:38.660 --> 30:38.960]  Yep.
[30:38.960 --> 30:40.660]  Already been sprung!
[30:49.820 --> 30:51.560]  Now I'm sprung.
[30:53.500 --> 30:54.620]  Okay, so...
[30:54.620 --> 30:55.640]  If I do this...
[31:02.080 --> 31:05.760]  Oh, you better spring.
[31:05.960 --> 31:06.320]  Look out!
[31:08.780 --> 31:10.020]  That's good, you evaded him.
[31:10.020 --> 31:11.960]  You scared the shit out of him.
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.680]  Spring has sprung!
[31:18.320 --> 31:18.620]  Oh!
[31:22.300 --> 31:24.280]  I didn't even know that was a thing.
[31:26.140 --> 31:27.580]  I guess that kind of makes sense.
[31:28.300 --> 31:28.440]  Yeah.
[31:30.620 --> 31:33.860]  I thought maybe I'd spring back on.
[31:33.940 --> 31:34.380]  It didn't work.
[31:36.520 --> 31:36.860]  Alright.
[31:36.860 --> 31:39.460]  And then there's Geoff, unabated to the hole.
[31:42.400 --> 31:44.520]  I never say unabated.
[31:45.740 --> 31:47.620]  Geoff is going up against Geoff.
[31:50.020 --> 31:51.400]  That ball has legs.
[31:52.340 --> 31:53.540]  Where's the nuke powerup?
[31:54.240 --> 31:55.160]  There's the blowhole.
[31:55.680 --> 31:56.160]  To the left.
[31:56.580 --> 31:58.260]  Gavin, you can get him. He's straight ahead of you.
[31:58.780 --> 32:00.620]  Yeah, should I just go full bore?
[32:00.860 --> 32:01.100]  Yeah!
[32:01.700 --> 32:02.760]  I mean, no, but yeah.
[32:05.300 --> 32:06.620]  Bad scorpion's gonna get you.
[32:06.760 --> 32:07.680]  Bad scorpion's a prick though.
[32:12.000 --> 32:12.800]  Bull beans?
[32:13.520 --> 32:13.920]  Shit.
[32:15.060 --> 32:16.300]  Wow, who could have seen that coming?
[32:17.300 --> 32:18.100]  That's so nuts.
[32:19.860 --> 32:20.260]  Anyway.
[32:21.260 --> 32:22.040]  Yeah, here we go.
[32:23.720 --> 32:25.180]  Wait, does that mean you go back to the start now?
[32:25.980 --> 32:26.660]  Wait, does it?
[32:27.080 --> 32:27.720]  I don't know.
[32:27.780 --> 32:28.460]  Oh, shit.
[32:29.180 --> 32:30.240]  Oh, in the boat.
[32:36.270 --> 32:37.710]  Oh, no, Eric.
[32:37.890 --> 32:39.170]  I'm good, I'm good.
[32:40.190 --> 32:40.590]  Spring!
[32:42.370 --> 32:43.170]  Right there.
[32:43.290 --> 32:43.690]  That's fine.
[32:43.910 --> 32:45.930]  At least now I'm lined up so I can get over the hole.
[32:46.430 --> 32:47.910]  I get over that little hump and then we're good.
[32:51.250 --> 32:51.650]  Bullshit.
[32:58.030 --> 32:59.230]  Fucking twin brother.
[32:59.230 --> 33:00.390]  Parrot me and everything.
[33:03.050 --> 33:04.610]  What's that power up round there?
[33:05.170 --> 33:05.590]  Suckle.
[33:06.210 --> 33:09.770]  Oh, I missed it.
[33:09.890 --> 33:10.610]  Oh, God.
[33:11.230 --> 33:12.710]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[33:12.870 --> 33:13.290]  What?
[33:14.510 --> 33:16.290]  Well, now you get another chance at it, buddy.
[33:19.210 --> 33:21.730]  Alright, back to the beginning of the course here with Andrew.
[33:22.430 --> 33:22.910]  What?
[33:28.370 --> 33:29.610]  Oh, my God.
[33:29.710 --> 33:30.370]  This game sucks.
[33:30.950 --> 33:32.650]  I'm tired of this life right now.
[33:34.070 --> 33:36.370]  I think you can go into the hole.
[33:36.570 --> 33:37.790]  I think you can go right in there.
[33:38.530 --> 33:38.550]  Oh, I was trying.
[33:38.550 --> 33:38.590]  Oh.
[33:43.730 --> 33:44.690]  Fucking scorpion.
[33:45.090 --> 33:46.130]  I hope it stings you.
[33:46.830 --> 33:48.830]  You just get to skip your turn.
[33:48.830 --> 33:51.270]  You've got 50 fucking strokes.
[33:51.490 --> 33:52.510]  This doesn't matter.
[33:52.770 --> 33:54.130]  Just walk off the course.
[33:54.850 --> 33:56.970]  Stop wasting our time.
[33:58.050 --> 33:59.250]  Talk to the guy
[33:59.250 --> 34:01.050]  who's in the beginning of the course.
[34:01.450 --> 34:02.790]  Yeah, plus five.
[34:03.990 --> 34:04.990]  What the fuck
[34:04.990 --> 34:05.610]  was that?
[34:06.850 --> 34:08.070]  Course position.
[34:10.170 --> 34:10.730]  Oh, twine.
[34:11.130 --> 34:11.250]  Oh.
[34:12.930 --> 34:13.750]  Get in.
[34:13.750 --> 34:14.470]  Oh.
[34:16.570 --> 34:17.050]  Spring.
[34:18.170 --> 34:18.810]  Got him.
[34:20.290 --> 34:21.770]  Okay, so I could just...
[34:21.770 --> 34:21.910]  Yeah.
[34:26.430 --> 34:27.250]  You got it.
[34:28.170 --> 34:28.750]  Am I lucky?
[34:29.150 --> 34:32.310]  Yeah, hit B as soon as you hit that power up.
[34:32.390 --> 34:32.870]  3, 2, 1.
[34:34.330 --> 34:34.990]  Hit B.
[34:35.810 --> 34:38.430]  Oh, it's not long.
[34:43.030 --> 34:44.150]  It might be long enough.
[34:45.370 --> 34:46.350]  Go for the hole.
[34:46.430 --> 34:48.210]  Yeah, you got it.
[34:49.370 --> 34:49.910]  Spring.
[34:50.510 --> 34:51.050]  No.
[34:51.470 --> 34:52.810]  All the way.
[34:53.950 --> 34:54.950]  Hell yeah.
[35:00.280 --> 35:01.780]  Oh my god.
[35:03.260 --> 35:04.120]  Geoff, you were right.
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.260]  This is the best video game.
[35:07.620 --> 35:09.020]  That was awesome.
[35:10.180 --> 35:12.140]  This really is the best video game.
[35:12.300 --> 35:13.800]  You were right the whole time.
[35:13.800 --> 35:14.900]  We didn't know.
[35:15.060 --> 35:17.220]  We had no idea. This really is.
[35:17.340 --> 35:19.500]  It's really special. This game is special.
[35:20.320 --> 35:21.220]  This game.
[35:21.360 --> 35:22.240]  You're back there.
[35:26.880 --> 35:28.160]  Oh god.
[35:31.160 --> 35:31.800]  No.
[35:38.980 --> 35:40.100]  That's the blowhole.
[35:48.890 --> 35:50.710]  That's right back right there.
[36:17.640 --> 36:19.200]  Oh my god.
[36:19.200 --> 36:21.040]  And now you blocked the hole.
[36:21.140 --> 36:22.300]  You fucking fell.
[36:24.940 --> 36:26.540]  Oh my god.
[36:28.420 --> 36:30.240]  Oh my god.
[36:34.100 --> 36:35.860]  I'm crying.
[36:37.620 --> 36:39.120]  You bastard.
[36:39.700 --> 36:40.620]  You bastard.
[36:41.400 --> 36:43.020]  I'll kill you.
[36:43.380 --> 36:44.420]  I'll kill you.
[36:46.360 --> 36:48.540]  I don't want to play.
[36:48.840 --> 36:49.320]  Get up.
[36:49.320 --> 36:51.380]  Get up.
[36:58.900 --> 37:02.280]  I just want it to be over.
[37:07.720 --> 37:10.060]  Oh my god.
[37:10.500 --> 37:12.120]  Get away from me, you schmuck.
[37:18.620 --> 37:19.260]  Oh my god.
[37:19.260 --> 37:20.500]  This is your fault.
[37:27.340 --> 37:29.500]  Just get me out of here.
[37:30.780 --> 37:31.740]  Oh my god.
[37:32.020 --> 37:33.480]  I can't laugh any harder.
[37:35.620 --> 37:39.620]  I'll kill you, I swear.
[37:39.620 --> 37:40.260]  I'm on the path.
[37:41.960 --> 37:43.360]  They took so long.
[37:43.480 --> 37:44.740]  The fire went out.
[37:45.400 --> 37:47.460]  You're going to be in the way of Eric now.
[37:47.880 --> 37:48.160]  Oh no.
[37:48.320 --> 37:50.180]  Eric, please.
[37:51.800 --> 37:53.060]  Eric, you can end the cycle.
[37:58.160 --> 37:58.640]  Shit.
[38:09.620 --> 38:10.620]  Oh shit.
[38:11.520 --> 38:12.360]  Oh my god.
[38:12.420 --> 38:15.340]  You did it.
[38:16.180 --> 38:17.700]  You've escaped your own hell.
[38:18.400 --> 38:19.500]  Oh fuck me.
[38:19.940 --> 38:21.460]  Let's just get over there.
[38:26.260 --> 38:28.180]  Is there no max number?
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.140]  I guess we're going to find out.
[38:32.140 --> 38:33.320]  Oh fuck.
[38:33.940 --> 38:35.100]  Oh my god.
[38:38.580 --> 38:39.960]  Alright, let's see who won.
[38:45.200 --> 38:46.920]  So Nick, if you want to swap out,
[38:47.040 --> 38:47.800]  you know, swap in.
[38:47.840 --> 38:49.220]  No wait, Gavin, you've got to play again.
[38:49.820 --> 38:50.520]  Dude, if anything,
[38:52.620 --> 38:53.640]  I'll swap out.
[38:53.920 --> 38:56.220]  No, no, no, you've got to stay in, dude.
[38:56.840 --> 38:58.920]  Dude, first and last have to stay in.
[38:59.000 --> 38:59.480]  Me and Andrew,
[38:59.480 --> 39:01.120]  me or Andrew can swap out.
[39:01.300 --> 39:02.540]  We've got to get Nick in here.
[39:03.560 --> 39:04.360]  Oh no.
[39:05.460 --> 39:07.780]  I'm happy. Andrew feels like
[39:07.780 --> 39:08.460]  he's going to be
[39:08.460 --> 39:10.400]  he wants in it so bad.
[39:10.860 --> 39:12.860]  I'll swap out, you can invite Nick.
[39:12.960 --> 39:13.760]  I'm really excited.
