[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  Hello and welcome to another Hitman Regulation gameplay.
[00:04.220 --> 00:07.760]  We're killing the Splitter, aka Jean-Claude Van Damme.
[00:07.820 --> 00:08.420]  How are you doing, Gavin?
[00:08.780 --> 00:09.380]  Good, thanks.
[00:09.880 --> 00:11.980]  Oh, like his legs. His legs do splits.
[00:12.100 --> 00:14.740]  He splits. That's sort of his whole thing.
[00:15.400 --> 00:17.360]  How is that his whole thing? What movie is that from?
[00:19.180 --> 00:20.520]  Uh... I don't know.
[00:20.720 --> 00:22.720]  Or is it just from the commercial with the trucks?
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.080]  Well, no, he must do it from a movie.
[00:25.160 --> 00:27.220]  I think Bloodsport, he probably does it.
[00:27.380 --> 00:28.700]  Oh, does he? That's like the one...
[00:28.700 --> 00:29.920]  I haven't seen...
[00:29.920 --> 00:31.300]  one Van Damme movie that I've seen.
[00:32.200 --> 00:34.260]  Do we watch the briefing now,
[00:34.340 --> 00:36.500]  or does it do the briefing when we hit play?
[00:37.480 --> 00:40.460]  I don't want a double brief, but I do want some briefing.
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.040]  Well, I'm sure you can skip the brief if it goes again.
[00:43.460 --> 00:45.360]  Okay, that's true. Let's do some briefing.
[00:47.480 --> 00:48.580]  Good afternoon, 47.
[00:49.500 --> 00:50.560]  Good afternoon to you.
[00:52.220 --> 00:54.000]  Ex-ICA assassin...
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.060]  Oh, he used to be one of us.
[00:56.320 --> 00:58.800]  This one is personal for ICA.
[00:58.800 --> 01:00.280]  Oh, the splits.
[01:02.260 --> 01:05.680]  Was that like a splits training room where the walls were getting further apart?
[01:08.780 --> 01:12.980]  I would pop both hamstrings if I was strapped into that.
[01:13.720 --> 01:14.640]  So quickly.
[01:15.200 --> 01:18.380]  Your legs would just make the sounds of like two guitar strings snapping.
[01:18.980 --> 01:20.120]  Oh, God. Yeah.
[01:21.140 --> 01:26.200]  I saw a video of a woman who popped her hamstring when trying to do the splits,
[01:26.200 --> 01:30.400]  and it was like a baseball bat exploding.
[01:30.700 --> 01:35.140]  It is insane the sounds the human body can make.
[01:35.500 --> 01:36.400]  That's foul.
[01:36.480 --> 01:38.380]  Maybe like a whip from Indiana Jones.
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.420]  Like it was, it was wild how loud it was.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.820]  Oh, oh, more splits.
[01:46.640 --> 01:48.860]  Oh, if he's just there, we could snipe him.
[01:49.040 --> 01:50.000]  That'd be real easy.
[01:51.340 --> 01:52.520]  Sniping right in the dick.
[01:54.140 --> 01:55.220]  Split him in half.
[01:58.380 --> 01:59.260]  OK, I...
[01:59.260 --> 02:04.100]  So far, these celebrity takeout levels are ones that I am not the greatest at,
[02:04.180 --> 02:05.260]  so this might get messy.
[02:05.740 --> 02:06.440]  What are you going to bring in?
[02:08.100 --> 02:09.900]  OK, so I have to have that disguise.
[02:11.300 --> 02:13.580]  I want my silencer, coin.
[02:15.300 --> 02:18.380]  I never smuggle things, but maybe I should smuggle something.
[02:19.640 --> 02:20.180]  Yeah, you should.
[02:23.760 --> 02:25.740]  Let's go facility maintenance.
[02:27.500 --> 02:29.340]  What do we got? I don't need a gun.
[02:30.400 --> 02:32.160]  Probably a tool that you want, right?
[02:33.140 --> 02:33.720]  I'd assume.
[02:34.340 --> 02:35.400]  As the smuggler I am?
[02:36.280 --> 02:37.960]  Yeah, that depends.
[02:38.760 --> 02:39.700]  Oh, maybe I can.
[02:40.580 --> 02:41.960]  What's a fun way I could get him?
[02:42.360 --> 02:42.980]  What do I got?
[02:45.060 --> 02:47.060]  A meaty bone is always good.
[02:49.200 --> 02:50.460]  Oh, you know what?
[02:50.460 --> 02:54.020]  End of the year, kind of, I kind of, I'm thinking it's winter.
[02:54.280 --> 02:55.160]  I'm thinking snowball.
[02:55.780 --> 02:57.220]  We're going to smuggle a snowball in.
[02:58.320 --> 03:02.920]  As a reference to snow day, I'm going to smuggle in a sneaky little snowball.
[03:03.900 --> 03:06.040]  Although unless it's like a refrigerated smuggle box,
[03:06.100 --> 03:07.420]  it's just going to be a puddle of water.
[03:07.440 --> 03:09.300]  It's just water. It's melted water.
[03:10.200 --> 03:11.460]  This contract is an elusive target.
[03:11.600 --> 03:13.460]  When playing an elusive target, the following rules apply.
[03:14.120 --> 03:16.480]  You must begin the contract before the countdown expires.
[03:16.540 --> 03:18.400]  If you die, you may not retry the contract.
[03:18.950 --> 03:22.360]  Once you've completed the contract and successfully exited,
[03:22.600 --> 03:24.020]  you may not retry the contract.
[03:24.540 --> 03:28.080]  Once you have begun to complete objectives, you may no longer restart.
[03:28.640 --> 03:30.260]  Plan accordingly. You cannot save.
[03:31.200 --> 03:33.720]  OK. Let's do this.
[03:35.400 --> 03:39.820]  So we've done this once before and I did it, but boy, was it a disaster.
[03:40.300 --> 03:41.480]  You shot Conor McGregor.
[03:41.580 --> 03:44.480]  I was taking pot shots. Yeah, from the top.
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.860]  And then all the guards came up and I had to kill a bunch of people.
[03:49.160 --> 03:50.700]  Let's try to be a little bit more sneaky.
[04:09.150 --> 04:11.430]  Oh, so these are like people that we're working with.
[04:14.210 --> 04:15.610]  Or you got a little squad.
[04:17.870 --> 04:21.110]  I don't know if I have a squad or if I'm pretending to be part of a squad.
[04:21.110 --> 04:22.490]  Have you met Valiant before?
[04:22.930 --> 04:25.210]  But I feel like we're all trying to kill him.
[04:25.950 --> 04:27.790]  Don't think you'd be happy to see me then. Why?
[04:31.030 --> 04:35.010]  It's important to stress we are not dealing with just I'm.
[04:35.690 --> 04:38.610]  I don't feel like I was debriefed for what's currently happening.
[04:39.210 --> 04:41.350]  Take him out. Yeah.
[04:43.270 --> 04:44.270]  Oh, there are people.
[04:46.510 --> 04:48.710]  I, I, I can't.
[04:55.830 --> 04:57.310]  If I could retry, I would.
[04:58.030 --> 05:01.870]  Well, I think you can retry as long as you haven't killed him.
[05:01.990 --> 05:04.210]  Yeah, I don't trust you respectfully.
[05:06.870 --> 05:08.750]  I'm going to keep Angus alive for now.
[05:13.110 --> 05:15.250]  Why don't why can't I have an umbrella?
[05:17.970 --> 05:19.330]  I want an umbrella.
[05:21.030 --> 05:22.590]  Also, these guys kind of look cool.
[05:24.870 --> 05:25.930]  Kind of like their look.
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.000]  They look like an action figure you would find at like the dollar store
[05:33.660 --> 05:36.580]  where it's not part of any specific property.
[05:36.720 --> 05:38.300]  It's just like action, man.
[05:38.840 --> 05:40.520]  Action man is a real property, though.
[05:41.020 --> 05:44.960]  Yeah. Actually, what about exciting man?
[05:47.480 --> 05:48.540]  Explosion boy.
[05:49.800 --> 05:54.860]  Oh, no. Oh, who's who's bleeding?
[05:54.860 --> 05:58.400]  Is that from when we came through here last time?
[05:59.980 --> 06:02.040]  I believe exciting man caused that.
[06:02.140 --> 06:03.640]  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bump you.
[06:03.960 --> 06:06.280]  I swear there's even bullet holes in the window.
[06:09.020 --> 06:11.480]  Oh, definite work of exciting man.
[06:12.600 --> 06:13.720]  I mean, that's an exciting cleanup.
[06:17.320 --> 06:18.620]  I was hoping I'd slip.
[06:21.380 --> 06:23.060]  Agent 47 doesn't really
[06:23.060 --> 06:25.060]  get tripped up in the same way
[06:25.060 --> 06:28.320]  that everyone else does in the environment on things like that.
[06:30.300 --> 06:32.920]  Like, I don't think I can make myself fall on a banana peel.
[06:34.780 --> 06:35.720]  That'd be awesome, though.
[06:35.960 --> 06:36.700]  It would be.
[06:37.540 --> 06:39.960]  Wow. It's cool that they've like distressed this building.
[06:40.840 --> 06:41.420]  It is, yeah.
[06:46.340 --> 06:49.160]  This is also how it looked when I did this fiction.
[06:49.820 --> 06:51.140]  It was not sneaky.
[06:53.060 --> 06:55.420]  Things went horribly wrong.
[07:00.360 --> 07:02.760]  I mean, this is a lot of talk.
[07:06.230 --> 07:08.360]  I think when it's your turn to try this,
[07:08.740 --> 07:11.540]  you just get on Angus immediately.
[07:16.620 --> 07:18.380]  Oh, there he is.
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.560]  Can't say it's a pleasure.
[07:24.800 --> 07:28.020]  No flowers. I'm pretty sure that's him.
[07:28.040 --> 07:29.940]  My bluntness, but I saw the blood out there.
[07:30.020 --> 07:32.320]  Collateral damage to get your attention.
[07:32.700 --> 07:36.060]  Damage. Look, I come in peace.
[07:36.600 --> 07:37.560]  What do you want, Valiant?
[07:38.200 --> 07:41.480]  You think if I just started saying damage in the way that he just did
[07:41.480 --> 07:44.600]  that the other guys would notice?
[07:45.240 --> 07:47.300]  The I see. I think they would.
[07:47.420 --> 07:49.720]  I think if I exclusively said damage.
[07:49.720 --> 07:57.260]  Don't mock me, eh?
[07:59.700 --> 08:01.700]  I think he's going to fuck somebody up.
[08:01.800 --> 08:03.320]  I think he might kill our guy, Angus.
[08:06.360 --> 08:07.400]  Oh, shit.
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.140]  You are here because fuck, yeah.
[08:11.240 --> 08:13.560]  Change the game big time.
[08:14.800 --> 08:17.080]  Why have I not seen more of his movies?
[08:17.140 --> 08:17.920]  This is great.
[08:18.200 --> 08:21.860]  The game you could just blow his dick off right now.
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.880]  I mean, there's a few to me.
[08:26.140 --> 08:27.500]  It's a borderline.
[08:36.480 --> 08:37.000]  Awesome.
[08:37.320 --> 08:38.800]  Of training. Yeah.
[08:45.560 --> 08:49.420]  Employing a single candidate is estimated at north of one.
[08:56.400 --> 08:57.280]  I bet you can grow.
[08:57.380 --> 08:57.940]  And right.
[08:58.160 --> 09:00.120]  What kind of talent doesn't come along very often.
[09:00.220 --> 09:01.020]  I like his scarf.
[09:01.300 --> 09:04.340]  Told you that I can boost recruits and cut costs.
[09:04.620 --> 09:05.660]  Let's say you're full of shit.
[09:08.860 --> 09:09.820]  Get him, Angus.
[09:14.460 --> 09:15.540]  Do you think he mo-capped this?
[09:18.680 --> 09:20.300]  No, I think he voiced it.
[09:27.560 --> 09:29.700]  I'd love to know who did mo-cap it now.
[09:31.140 --> 09:32.280]  It's a fun mo-cap.
[09:32.720 --> 09:33.560]  Someone I could do a split.
[09:34.200 --> 09:34.720]  Yeah.
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.920]  What did you discover?
[09:42.400 --> 09:44.400]  Yeah, fucking wrong, Angus.
[09:45.080 --> 09:46.060]  Oh, there's people there.
[09:46.660 --> 09:47.680]  Oh, like a gym team?
[09:48.920 --> 09:49.560]  One, two.
[09:50.880 --> 09:53.000]  Blank. Five, six.
[09:53.980 --> 09:55.620]  This is a threat we could not have predicted.
[09:56.380 --> 09:57.440]  There's a shitload of them.
[09:58.020 --> 09:59.320]  Stand by for further instructions.
[10:00.420 --> 10:01.580]  This is a breakthrough.
[10:01.980 --> 10:02.720]  It's unethical.
[10:02.720 --> 10:04.100]  Is him but young?
[10:06.520 --> 10:08.760]  Uh, I just think it's...
[10:11.420 --> 10:12.840]  I guess it is.
[10:15.960 --> 10:17.280]  Do you have to take them all out?
[10:19.420 --> 10:21.060]  Oh, oh, oh no!
[10:21.600 --> 10:22.560]  You pissed them off.
[10:23.300 --> 10:24.440]  I pissed everyone off.
[10:26.480 --> 10:26.960]  OK.
[10:27.440 --> 10:29.340]  Did we miss a lot of the exposition there?
[10:30.200 --> 10:31.300]  I feel like we may have.
[10:31.300 --> 10:32.620]  Sneaked around it for a while.
[10:33.080 --> 10:33.460]  Could you?
[10:33.820 --> 10:34.660]  OK, here we go.
[10:34.720 --> 10:35.720]  We're syncing it back up.
[10:45.260 --> 10:45.700]  Yeah.
[10:47.860 --> 10:49.560]  Oh, Hitman is so good.
[10:51.120 --> 10:51.560]  Whoa.
[10:51.960 --> 10:53.180]  Whoa, shit.
[10:54.280 --> 10:55.160]  There's 13?
[10:56.080 --> 10:56.920]  No way.
[10:59.460 --> 11:00.760]  Well, yeah, we get it, lady.
[11:00.760 --> 11:02.240]  We just said this three times.
[11:06.940 --> 11:07.980]  Oh, man.
[11:08.320 --> 11:09.460]  This is crazy.
[11:10.360 --> 11:11.060]  It's just like that.
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.460]  Did you ever play the original Hitman?
[11:12.920 --> 11:13.280]  No.
[11:14.440 --> 11:18.440]  The last level is you have to fight off like 13 of your own clones.
[11:19.040 --> 11:19.540]  Oh.
[11:22.280 --> 11:23.280]  Oh, shit.
[11:23.480 --> 11:23.760]  OK.
[11:24.520 --> 11:25.500]  Oh, man, this is.
[11:25.640 --> 11:30.200]  Oh, oh, I can barely take out one target in a session.
[11:30.200 --> 11:32.980]  That's such a good thing that you didn't just blow his cock off
[11:32.980 --> 11:36.100]  while he was doing the splits, because he had 12 more of them to kill.
[11:36.540 --> 11:37.260]  Oh, no.
[11:37.560 --> 11:39.900]  I wonder what it would have done to announce that as well.
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.060]  Like, by the way.
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.100]  Yeah.
[11:44.340 --> 11:45.400]  This is crazy.
[11:47.640 --> 11:48.100]  You know what?
[11:48.380 --> 11:52.140]  OK, we got the first one in here.
[11:52.220 --> 11:52.800]  First for you.
[11:55.740 --> 11:56.400]  Oh, shit.
[11:57.340 --> 11:58.060]  What are we doing here?
[11:58.580 --> 12:00.600]  We got a scientist taking notes.
[12:02.460 --> 12:06.020]  Feels like I can maybe kill them with the targets.
[12:06.900 --> 12:09.880]  Yeah, like put a fake gun there or something.
[12:10.280 --> 12:13.900]  Well, I'm thinking I could maybe have them smash into them somehow.
[12:14.240 --> 12:16.380]  Yeah, but did you see the canister behind them?
[12:16.920 --> 12:19.640]  Yeah. I just want to see if there's a way that I could
[12:20.160 --> 12:22.660]  like activate these rails and something.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.780]  What's on the other side of it?
[12:28.780 --> 12:31.720]  There's like a monitor, like a computer type thing.
[12:32.320 --> 12:35.080]  There's got to be a way to like accident kill all of them.
[12:36.140 --> 12:37.320]  You would think, yeah.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.540]  Hey, although it's pretty cool to be able to walk around this level without getting
[12:42.580 --> 12:43.920]  shot. Yeah.
[12:44.600 --> 12:47.980]  If you if you stand in front of them while they're practicing, will they kill you?
[12:51.060 --> 12:53.240]  I don't think I can get on to the course.
[12:53.680 --> 12:54.160]  What did it say?
[12:54.260 --> 12:55.200]  What do you look to that gun?
[12:55.200 --> 12:58.740]  Yeah. The other one.
[13:00.480 --> 13:01.820]  I just said the name of it.
[13:02.020 --> 13:02.920]  Militia issued.
[13:09.210 --> 13:10.810]  What? Pause it! Pause it!
[13:12.510 --> 13:12.870]  What?
[13:17.530 --> 13:18.770]  Wait, how do you?
[13:19.930 --> 13:21.710]  What do you what do you want from me?
[13:22.130 --> 13:24.130]  Well, it's going to you won't be able to redo it.
[13:24.570 --> 13:24.930]  No.
[13:26.590 --> 13:29.370]  So if you exit, is it?
[13:31.410 --> 13:33.330]  No, I'm not exiting. I'm just locked in.
[13:33.590 --> 13:35.070]  But you're going to die. It's going to be over.
[13:35.210 --> 13:37.050]  No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to I'm going to do it.
[13:37.210 --> 13:38.810]  But if you exit, does it just let you do it again?
[13:39.330 --> 13:39.610]  No.
[13:42.170 --> 13:43.430]  Because an objective started.
[13:44.050 --> 13:44.650]  What was the objective?
[13:46.090 --> 13:47.590]  To kill the 12 people.
[13:48.070 --> 13:50.450]  Yeah, but usually it doesn't start until you've killed one of them.
[13:50.830 --> 13:50.930]  I.
[13:52.710 --> 13:54.270]  I think I can make it out of this.
[13:54.430 --> 13:54.910]  Well, I think I can make it out of this.
[13:54.910 --> 13:57.370]  Press X to see what the warning message says.
[13:59.310 --> 14:01.030]  Yeah, you've started. Yeah, you're right.
[14:02.670 --> 14:04.250]  Fuck. Yeah, you've.
[14:05.330 --> 14:07.370]  How am I? How is that?
[14:08.490 --> 14:11.590]  It was a shooting range and there are guns all over.
[14:13.190 --> 14:14.530]  Oh, no.
[14:15.430 --> 14:17.610]  You're like one second away from dying.
[14:19.290 --> 14:19.550]  OK.
[14:24.550 --> 14:25.130]  No.
[14:25.130 --> 14:29.650]  Oh, you'll you'll you'll.
[14:33.020 --> 14:34.000]  Oh, fuck.
[14:36.760 --> 14:39.120]  She's. Oh, my God.
[14:39.780 --> 14:41.300]  This is so bad.
[14:44.870 --> 14:46.590]  Oh, they're coming.
[14:50.180 --> 14:50.960]  You got to hide.
[14:53.760 --> 14:54.940]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.500]  You got to get you got to get somewhere safe.
[14:58.540 --> 14:59.560]  I can't believe you're alive.
[15:03.340 --> 15:05.520]  There's so many more over there.
[15:06.780 --> 15:09.500]  Oh, oh, oh.
[15:10.260 --> 15:13.950]  Run. You're just Junko.
[15:14.010 --> 15:15.830]  And I'm running. I'm running. I'm sprinting.
[15:18.930 --> 15:20.430]  Oh, you. Holy fuck.
[15:20.510 --> 15:21.630]  Holy fuck. Holy fuck.
[15:21.710 --> 15:22.190]  Holy fuck.
[15:22.750 --> 15:24.550]  You just got to you got to hide.
[15:24.590 --> 15:25.430]  You got to get a cupboard.
[15:25.530 --> 15:26.270]  You got to do something.
[15:27.410 --> 15:28.270]  Oh, my God.
[15:31.890 --> 15:33.330]  You can take his gun.
[15:33.330 --> 15:43.000]  Are you okay? Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[15:44.060 --> 15:45.580]  I've got 23 bullets.
[15:56.600 --> 15:58.820]  You're dropping Van Damme's left and right!
[15:59.060 --> 16:01.280]  Oh my god! 20 bullets!
[16:02.640 --> 16:03.560]  You can pick up ammo!
[16:12.420 --> 16:14.060]  You're safe! Oh, good shot!
[16:15.540 --> 16:16.400]  Great shooting!
[16:16.960 --> 16:17.720]  7 bullets!
[16:23.610 --> 16:24.010]  Woo!
[16:29.010 --> 16:31.890]  Every time I do one of these, this is how it goes!
[16:35.570 --> 16:36.790]  Van Damme coming up!
[16:39.090 --> 16:39.490]  Woo!
[16:43.360 --> 16:45.760]  Okay, I can't shoot through that.
[16:50.450 --> 16:52.310]  Van Damme's... you got...
[16:52.310 --> 16:53.050]  Oh, it's him!
[16:55.210 --> 16:56.130]  Alright, pick up a gun.
[16:57.550 --> 16:58.170]  Uh...
[17:05.590 --> 17:06.930]  Another Van Damme!
[17:07.730 --> 17:08.690]  Oh, he's below.
[17:13.890 --> 17:15.450]  There's one doing the splits!
[17:15.770 --> 17:16.210]  Did you see that?
[17:17.770 --> 17:19.010]  Oh yeah!
[17:20.810 --> 17:23.350]  He must be in the training moving wall room.
[17:28.310 --> 17:29.710]  Fucking... I want...
[17:29.710 --> 17:30.470]  Get me out of here!
[17:32.570 --> 17:32.970]  Oh.
[17:35.190 --> 17:37.010]  Hang on, you might have a new outfit in here.
[17:37.270 --> 17:37.470]  Yep.
[17:41.440 --> 17:44.740]  One of them's T-posing. I'm not sure if that's meant to be doing that.
[17:45.940 --> 17:46.800]  Oh, down there?
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.280]  He's just doing the opposite of his leg split.
[17:58.450 --> 18:00.150]  This is wild. This is exciting.
[18:00.590 --> 18:01.190]  Facility analyst.
[18:02.350 --> 18:03.850]  With a massive gun!
[18:07.300 --> 18:08.540]  Okay, I think I'm okay.
[18:17.290 --> 18:19.510]  There's still so many more to kill!
[18:24.900 --> 18:26.320]  You think I can hit him from here?
[18:33.160 --> 18:33.940]  Let's see.
[18:41.040 --> 18:42.420]  Did anyone see me?
[18:43.980 --> 18:45.520]  Am I still okay?
[18:53.200 --> 18:56.900]  I want to go to the T-posing one, but we got this guy.
[18:59.060 --> 19:00.540]  Don't see me, don't see me, don't see me.
[19:03.080 --> 19:04.980]  You don't give a fuck about the scan!
[19:07.980 --> 19:08.840]  Let's try this.
[19:17.240 --> 19:19.940]  Nobody look at me, nobody come here.
[19:20.040 --> 19:23.160]  Nobody look around, putting a body away.
[19:24.460 --> 19:26.380]  Dumpin' a body in a closet.
[19:32.930 --> 19:34.230]  How do I go down?
[19:36.350 --> 19:37.150]  He's suspicious.
[19:38.890 --> 19:41.590]  Go the other way, go the other way, go the other way, go the other way.
[19:41.750 --> 19:42.030]  Fuck.
[19:44.210 --> 19:45.390]  Fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay.
[19:46.790 --> 19:48.070]  I don't think I went this way.
[19:48.510 --> 19:49.690]  Got around the scan.
[19:52.570 --> 19:54.230]  Pick up apricot.
[19:57.760 --> 19:59.940]  Yeah, let's go to the T-posing guy.
[20:00.340 --> 20:02.380]  I can grab a gun, I think.
[20:02.820 --> 20:03.100]  Yep.
[20:06.100 --> 20:06.880]  More ammo.
[20:10.920 --> 20:12.220]  He doesn't detect me.
[20:13.440 --> 20:14.380]  Where's the T-poser?
[20:14.760 --> 20:15.400]  Oh, there he is.
[20:21.320 --> 20:22.780]  This is an important disguise.
[20:23.300 --> 20:24.420]  What's going on, sir?
[20:29.620 --> 20:30.300]  Oh.
[20:31.240 --> 20:32.260]  Oh, he is.
[20:32.740 --> 20:33.580]  That's on purpose.
[20:33.960 --> 20:35.500]  What does the door say?
[20:36.700 --> 20:38.280]  Oh, it's a failure.
[20:39.580 --> 20:41.340]  He can't move, he's just T-posing.
[20:46.580 --> 20:48.280]  He ain't dancing.
[20:51.380 --> 20:52.240]  Thank you.
[20:54.960 --> 20:56.720]  Why are you here?
[20:57.920 --> 21:00.320]  You walked into me and then are like, what the hell?
[21:01.280 --> 21:02.340]  You walked into me!
[21:03.500 --> 21:05.500]  So you're allowed to just go in there and murder this one?
[21:08.480 --> 21:09.220]  Hey, man.
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.900]  I think he's supposed to be dancing.
[21:14.120 --> 21:15.100]  Oh, he's... yeah.
[21:15.780 --> 21:16.240]  Probably.
[21:22.390 --> 21:24.630]  I think that's a distraction, not a weapon.
[21:30.910 --> 21:31.390]  Uh...
[21:31.910 --> 21:32.390]  Shit.
[21:33.250 --> 21:33.410]  Huh.
[21:35.710 --> 21:36.190]  Um...
[21:36.190 --> 21:38.590]  If they just let you shoot him...
[21:38.590 --> 21:39.090]  Oh my god.
[21:41.190 --> 21:41.670]  Wow.
[21:42.670 --> 21:43.150]  Brutal.
[21:43.690 --> 21:45.950]  I've never seen you allowed to kill someone before.
[21:45.950 --> 21:47.670]  Yeah, that was pretty...
[21:47.670 --> 21:49.170]  You think they'll get upset if I drag him?
[21:50.030 --> 21:50.590]  Is that a...
[21:52.310 --> 21:53.230]  Excuse me.
[21:54.690 --> 21:56.390]  You had to do that, didn't you?
[21:57.310 --> 21:57.790]  Shit.
[21:58.230 --> 21:59.910]  They didn't account for that?
[22:01.650 --> 22:02.130]  Fuck.
[22:08.820 --> 22:10.360]  We're all going in now.
[22:10.920 --> 22:13.280]  They were fine with you blowing the back of his head out, but
[22:13.280 --> 22:15.520]  moving him along the floor, hell no.
[22:15.900 --> 22:16.380]  No.
[22:16.580 --> 22:18.420]  You gotta get a janitor for that.
[22:18.820 --> 22:20.220]  Get blood all over the place.
[22:21.060 --> 22:22.640]  God, you got right in his face.
[22:23.040 --> 22:23.340]  Yeah.
[22:24.880 --> 22:25.300]  Drag.
[22:25.300 --> 22:25.780]  Drag.
[22:29.240 --> 22:31.040]  What do you think my score is gonna be?
[22:31.220 --> 22:32.000]  If I beat this?
[22:32.860 --> 22:34.460]  I'm gonna get so many points.
[22:35.780 --> 22:37.260]  I've been doing this so well
[22:37.260 --> 22:37.880]  and sneaky.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.760]  I mean, considering how this started,
[22:40.940 --> 22:42.880]  the progress you've made is absolutely
[22:42.880 --> 22:43.380]  phenomenal.
[22:46.140 --> 22:46.580]  Alright.
[22:48.880 --> 22:51.040]  I don't think I need the key anymore,
[22:51.160 --> 22:51.960]  but I'll take it.
[22:54.000 --> 22:54.940]  I wonder if he'll be
[22:54.940 --> 22:56.260]  dancing for me or T-pose.
[22:57.240 --> 22:59.120]  Oh. I hope he's dancing.
[22:59.420 --> 23:00.180]  I'd love to see it.
[23:01.920 --> 23:02.720]  How do I get down?
[23:02.820 --> 23:03.480]  Oh, what's that?
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.760]  Tier 3 access dongle.
[23:07.380 --> 23:08.620]  Oh, he loves the dongle.
[23:09.300 --> 23:10.840]  Let's dong a little bit.
[23:13.360 --> 23:14.560]  Can I dong over here?
[23:15.060 --> 23:16.340]  I'll unplug the server, why not?
[23:16.720 --> 23:17.280]  Oh, shit.
[23:19.920 --> 23:21.000]  I didn't seem like
[23:21.000 --> 23:21.580]  it did a lot.
[23:22.040 --> 23:22.920]  It's a distraction.
[23:30.080 --> 23:30.660]  Night, night.
[23:33.020 --> 23:34.400]  Any reason for that, or you just
[23:34.400 --> 23:36.600]  felt like it? I don't know what I'm doing with
[23:36.600 --> 23:37.120]  the server.
[23:40.950 --> 23:42.110]  Was it just that, like,
[23:42.150 --> 23:44.110]  what was the point of that? What did I do, I wonder.
[23:44.430 --> 23:45.590]  I think it just draws her away from
[23:46.230 --> 23:48.010]  if you want the outfit. From what?
[23:48.110 --> 23:49.690]  She was over here.
[23:50.110 --> 23:50.830]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23:52.970 --> 23:54.130]  Maybe it makes more sense
[23:54.130 --> 23:55.350]  in the main mission.
[23:55.350 --> 23:56.810]  Yeah, maybe.
[24:04.710 --> 24:06.930]  This is very Hitman 1.
[24:10.050 --> 24:11.330]  Got a little diaper.
[24:11.910 --> 24:12.870]  Look at his little diaper.
[24:13.810 --> 24:15.590]  He's oddly, like, sheeny for being
[24:15.590 --> 24:15.990]  underwater.
[24:20.530 --> 24:21.790]  I'm out of your face.
[24:21.790 --> 24:21.970]  Six.
[24:24.130 --> 24:25.270]  Increase the temperature.
[24:25.750 --> 24:26.570]  You can boil him.
[24:27.590 --> 24:29.070]  You gotta get a six for one boil.
[24:32.500 --> 24:33.260]  Maybe that's
[24:33.260 --> 24:35.260]  the server thing
[24:35.260 --> 24:36.120]  allowed me to do.
[24:40.500 --> 24:41.380]  I knew we got
[24:41.380 --> 24:43.200]  six. There's six of these guys.
[24:43.340 --> 24:44.840]  Six little toasty Van Dams.
[24:45.600 --> 24:46.320]  Twenty-six.
[24:49.520 --> 24:51.180]  Boil. Oh, this is horrific.
[24:51.180 --> 24:51.400]  This is horrific.
[24:54.200 --> 24:55.060]  Oh, God.
[24:55.400 --> 24:56.260]  It says boil.
[24:57.880 --> 24:58.980]  How are we hearing them
[24:58.980 --> 24:59.660]  yell underwater?
[25:03.650 --> 25:04.550]  This is gruesome.
[25:05.290 --> 25:06.250]  That was horrible.
[25:07.230 --> 25:08.110]  That's sadistic.
[25:09.970 --> 25:11.070]  Can I get him out?
[25:13.330 --> 25:14.570]  Wait. Oh, he went in.
[25:15.110 --> 25:17.590]  Shit. Could you have wrenched him the whole time?
[25:20.130 --> 25:21.630]  Can I break the glass, I wonder?
[25:21.630 --> 25:23.330]  Let's silence it.
[25:27.350 --> 25:28.570]  What the hell?
[25:28.790 --> 25:30.330]  I can make him bounce around.
[25:30.810 --> 25:32.470]  There's no glass bullet hole?
[25:33.470 --> 25:34.230]  Is that glass?
[25:34.890 --> 25:35.850]  I don't know.
[25:36.430 --> 25:41.090]  I can spin him. 360.
[25:44.870 --> 25:46.570]  I wonder if
[25:46.570 --> 25:48.690]  you shoot one, do the other ones
[25:48.690 --> 25:49.670]  underwater react?
[25:51.430 --> 25:51.950]  Oh.
[25:52.770 --> 25:53.630]  I don't know.
[25:54.810 --> 25:56.390]  Can't really test it now, unfortunately.
[25:56.510 --> 25:57.250]  Oh, what is this?
[25:57.550 --> 25:59.530]  What is this?
[25:59.990 --> 26:01.270]  Like a dentist light?
[26:03.070 --> 26:04.210]  I wonder if you can make it just
[26:04.210 --> 26:04.890]  crush someone.
[26:10.830 --> 26:12.450]  It doesn't work anymore.
[26:12.750 --> 26:13.670]  Oh, let me put my gun away.
[26:15.110 --> 26:15.830]  One remaining.
[26:16.990 --> 26:18.070]  He's up here.
[26:18.310 --> 26:19.230]  Pardon me.
[26:27.900 --> 26:32.120]  Is there a cool way for me to do this?
[26:34.700 --> 26:35.640]  What's in here?
[26:37.760 --> 26:38.300]  Hell yeah.
[26:41.120 --> 26:43.140]  Give me another dongle.
[26:47.670 --> 26:48.250]  Oh.
[26:48.530 --> 26:49.510]  More points.
[26:50.350 --> 26:51.330]  Get rid of the evidence.
[26:52.450 --> 26:53.230]  I like that they've got
[26:53.230 --> 26:55.150]  server racks everywhere, but they're recording to
[26:55.150 --> 26:57.250]  desktop hard drives.
[27:01.210 --> 27:01.630]  Oh.
[27:02.730 --> 27:03.670]  Just a glass.
[27:04.590 --> 27:06.190]  I was hoping it would do more than just that room.
[27:07.590 --> 27:08.310]  Where is he?
[27:08.470 --> 27:08.950]  Where did he go?
[27:11.270 --> 27:11.470]  Oh.
[27:12.450 --> 27:13.290]  He's exercising?
[27:16.790 --> 27:18.270]  Is there anything goofy?
[27:18.270 --> 27:19.710]  Can you make him cycle to death?
[27:19.710 --> 27:21.890]  Yeah, let's see.
[27:24.210 --> 27:25.530]  Research disguise.
[27:26.610 --> 27:27.870]  Careful, he's
[27:27.870 --> 27:28.750]  an enforcer guy.
[27:29.390 --> 27:29.990]  Yep.
[27:31.950 --> 27:32.810]  Wow.
[27:33.970 --> 27:34.370]  What?
[27:35.210 --> 27:36.690]  Might want to put that gun down.
[27:37.770 --> 27:42.870]  Ah, shit.
[27:45.830 --> 27:46.710]  Uh oh. No!
[27:46.710 --> 27:46.810]  No!
[27:51.810 --> 27:53.570]  Can I dress as him?
[27:56.730 --> 27:58.170]  I gotta get rid of the body.
[28:00.670 --> 28:01.630]  I can't throw him.
[28:04.350 --> 28:04.890]  Shit.
[28:10.540 --> 28:12.000]  I got spooked by me.
[28:13.540 --> 28:19.380]  I'm gonna put this back on.
[28:22.420 --> 28:24.380]  Man, I'm not sure I could do this as good as you have.
[28:25.320 --> 28:26.460]  Oh, you'll be able to
[28:26.460 --> 28:27.580]  do it way better than me.
[28:28.340 --> 28:30.340]  Actually, let's go down. I want to dress up like our man
[28:30.340 --> 28:30.820]  Angus.
[28:32.540 --> 28:34.300]  Did I kill him? I think I killed him, right?
[28:36.140 --> 28:37.580]  Where did that even happen?
[28:37.900 --> 28:39.080]  It was above the level, right?
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.400]  Did he try to kill you when
[28:42.400 --> 28:43.000]  it all kicked off?
[28:44.140 --> 28:45.140]  I think so.
[28:48.850 --> 28:49.490]  Maybe not.
[28:50.910 --> 28:51.830]  I mean, this is where it kicked
[28:51.830 --> 28:52.410]  off, right?
[28:54.410 --> 28:55.730]  Oh, no! I did it.
[28:55.830 --> 28:57.790]  I shot in the gun range. I don't know where
[28:57.790 --> 28:58.530]  he went. Never mind.
[28:58.770 --> 29:00.150]  I misremembered.
[29:03.090 --> 29:04.430]  How do I get out of here?
[29:08.870 --> 29:09.230]  Above?
[29:12.850 --> 29:13.630]  There's one over
[29:13.990 --> 29:14.350]  there.
[29:15.730 --> 29:16.910]  Why is this one locked?
[29:21.830 --> 29:22.230]  Let's see.
[29:23.550 --> 29:25.050]  It's just so close. I might as well
[29:26.090 --> 29:26.570]  investigate.
[29:31.430 --> 29:32.390]  Emergency exit.
[29:34.770 --> 29:35.410]  Oh, you might
[29:35.410 --> 29:36.970]  need to hack it open with the camera.
[29:37.610 --> 29:38.030]  Maybe.
[29:44.640 --> 29:46.260]  Maybe this will cause an emergency.
[29:47.620 --> 29:48.640]  You're an insane person.
[29:50.740 --> 29:52.760]  I mean, that seems like an emergency to me.
[29:56.400 --> 29:57.820]  I've done all my objectives.
[29:57.960 --> 29:59.340]  Let me cause an emergency.
[30:03.480 --> 30:05.040]  I'd like to leave now.
[30:06.160 --> 30:07.000]  What's this?
[30:08.120 --> 30:09.680]  Oh, I can increase the
[30:09.680 --> 30:10.320]  sauna temperature.
[30:12.040 --> 30:13.720]  Can I grab anything
[30:13.720 --> 30:14.520]  from the... no?
[30:16.080 --> 30:17.180]  Let's just get out of here.
[30:17.460 --> 30:18.960]  I'm just killing time.
[30:21.040 --> 30:22.060]  Let's get out of here.
[30:24.640 --> 30:25.860]  I was the splits guy.
[30:27.920 --> 30:29.320]  I thought that looked familiar.
[30:29.480 --> 30:31.260]  It's where we threw the can at the man.
[30:31.740 --> 30:32.740]  That was your best kill, I think.
[30:33.340 --> 30:34.040]  Yeah, it was pretty good.
[30:37.580 --> 30:38.580]  I bet you if you
[30:38.580 --> 30:40.760]  cycled the guy to death, that one was
[30:40.760 --> 30:41.640]  also pretty good.
[30:55.040 --> 30:55.420]  City...
[30:55.420 --> 30:57.540]  How do I...
[30:57.540 --> 30:58.880]  How do I get out of here?
[31:01.340 --> 31:03.220]  I kind of forget that there's a whole city
[31:03.220 --> 31:05.000]  landscape to what we were doing.
[31:05.200 --> 31:06.480]  The levels in this game are huge.
[31:08.340 --> 31:09.240]  Such a narrow
[31:09.240 --> 31:10.180]  part of this level.
[31:15.380 --> 31:16.260]  Excuse me.
[31:16.840 --> 31:18.200]  I found this to be quite an intimidating
[31:18.200 --> 31:19.320]  level in the main game.
[31:20.300 --> 31:21.860]  So much of it is like
[31:21.860 --> 31:22.720]  off limits.
[31:23.380 --> 31:25.640]  Both this and the
[31:26.980 --> 31:27.460]  finale
[31:28.260 --> 31:29.900]  I found to be very intimidating.
[31:30.320 --> 31:31.180]  Which one was the finale?
[31:31.500 --> 31:33.520]  The one where we did the Conor McGregor mission.
[31:33.520 --> 31:34.300]  Oh, yeah.
[31:44.500 --> 31:45.620]  I don't...
[31:45.620 --> 31:46.940]  The second hardest
[31:46.940 --> 31:48.700]  thing I've had to do in this thing is just
[31:48.700 --> 31:49.500]  figure out an exit.
[31:52.720 --> 31:53.620]  That's me.
[31:55.080 --> 31:55.640]  You!
[32:02.190 --> 32:03.030]  Excuse me.
[32:04.750 --> 32:05.730]  Oh, shit.
[32:06.890 --> 32:08.530]  Basically just walked into the military
[32:08.530 --> 32:10.390]  of the entire rest of the level.
[32:12.310 --> 32:13.610]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[32:15.590 --> 32:16.470]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[32:16.890 --> 32:18.490]  If you get killed by the people who didn't
[32:18.490 --> 32:20.690]  even know about the mission, it would be hilarious.
[32:21.830 --> 32:22.010]  Okay.
[32:23.810 --> 32:24.830]  How is that an exit?
[32:24.970 --> 32:25.570]  I did it!
[32:30.510 --> 32:32.170]  The guard running in the background.
[32:34.450 --> 32:35.150]  Oh, magic.
[32:36.390 --> 32:37.190]  I can't
[32:37.190 --> 32:38.310]  believe I made it out of there.
[32:38.850 --> 32:40.850]  That was messy as hell.
[32:45.000 --> 32:46.200]  2000 XP.
[32:48.880 --> 32:50.260]  That was so well played.
[32:51.600 --> 32:52.600]  26 minutes.
[32:52.880 --> 32:53.780]  Zero stars.
[32:55.140 --> 32:56.320]  Zero mission score.
[33:03.030 --> 33:04.530]  Oh, yeah.
[33:07.250 --> 33:08.710]  I unlocked the splitter suit.
[33:10.330 --> 33:10.770]  Well,
[33:10.830 --> 33:12.730]  that was a total disaster. You learned what
[33:12.730 --> 33:14.570]  not to do, but I'm excited now, Gavin,
[33:14.710 --> 33:16.730]  to watch your run. So let's
[33:16.730 --> 33:18.770]  cut into that. Okay.
[33:19.050 --> 33:20.830]  And now we're back watching
[33:20.830 --> 33:22.650]  Gavin. Are you ready, Gavin? Have you
[33:22.650 --> 33:24.690]  taken notes from my flawless run?
[33:25.270 --> 33:26.730]  I learned a lot. I learned that
[33:26.730 --> 33:29.090]  it's not okay to use the shooting range.
[33:29.190 --> 33:30.230]  Don't use the shooting range.
[33:32.030 --> 33:32.730]  Do use
[33:32.730 --> 33:34.690]  soda cans. Oh, my God. Did I not
[33:35.450 --> 33:36.790]  unlock anything on this level?
[33:36.790 --> 33:37.730]  What's going on here?
[33:40.510 --> 33:41.310]  I did...
[33:41.310 --> 33:42.850]  I mean, you said in the
[33:42.850 --> 33:44.630]  last part that you were intimidated
[33:44.630 --> 33:46.590]  by this level, so I could see
[33:46.590 --> 33:48.350]  you beat it and moved on, it
[33:48.350 --> 33:48.950]  appears.
[33:50.590 --> 33:52.730]  Do you think we could... Have you
[33:52.730 --> 33:54.510]  ever seen those pranks where they have the
[33:54.510 --> 33:56.130]  exploding golf ball in real life?
[33:57.030 --> 33:58.390]  Yeah, and there's just this bunch of powder.
[33:58.730 --> 34:00.110]  Do you think we could get
[34:00.670 --> 34:02.670]  Geoff by doing that with
[34:02.670 --> 34:03.090]  a baseball?
[34:03.810 --> 34:05.510]  Do you think we could find an
[34:05.510 --> 34:07.590]  exploding fake baseball and then
[34:07.590 --> 34:09.070]  do like a... He's got to sign him?
[34:10.730 --> 34:11.670]  Like put a
[34:11.670 --> 34:13.010]  bath bomb in a pitching machine?
[34:17.500 --> 34:18.720]  Yeah, we should do that.
[34:21.060 --> 34:21.900]  I mean, look at that.
[34:22.540 --> 34:25.160]  I don't know if they ever moved
[34:25.160 --> 34:27.620]  the baseballs, but they really should have if they didn't.
[34:28.440 --> 34:29.380]  I'm switching my golf
[34:29.380 --> 34:30.220]  ball for more poison.
[34:31.640 --> 34:33.060]  Can't go wrong with more poison.
[34:34.840 --> 34:36.660]  When in doubt, poison more.
[34:39.500 --> 34:41.180]  They have exploding baseballs
[34:41.180 --> 34:42.280]  for gender reveals?
[34:43.600 --> 34:44.200]  But...
[34:44.620 --> 34:46.440]  I'm not sure about the integrity
[34:46.440 --> 34:48.080]  if they would sell
[34:48.720 --> 34:50.160]  for a real baseball.
[34:53.560 --> 34:56.800]  At the very least, we could coat them in either blue or
[34:56.800 --> 34:57.260]  pink.
[34:58.320 --> 34:59.340]  I think we're ready to go.
[35:00.700 --> 35:01.600]  Let's do it.
[35:03.540 --> 35:04.020]  Are you
[35:04.020 --> 35:05.460]  going to try to take out Angus immediately,
[35:05.660 --> 35:07.360]  or are you going to let it play out? Are you trying to do like
[35:07.360 --> 35:08.320]  sneaky the whole way?
[35:09.100 --> 35:11.220]  I think I'll go in with Angus again just to
[35:11.220 --> 35:13.440]  get inside. As much as I want to
[35:13.440 --> 35:15.360]  shoot the back of his head from the get-go.
[35:18.280 --> 35:19.560]  Ooh, don't draw attention
[35:19.560 --> 35:21.160]  to yourself. Yeah, good tip.
[35:22.020 --> 35:22.740]  Good tip.
[35:24.460 --> 35:25.440]  If there is a
[35:25.440 --> 35:27.400]  shooting range and a bunch of guns that are
[35:27.400 --> 35:29.360]  just available for you to grab, don't think that you
[35:29.360 --> 35:30.820]  could just join in on the shooting.
[35:31.800 --> 35:33.300]  Do you think if I use the
[35:33.300 --> 35:35.360]  shooting range with a silenced pistol, it would work?
[35:37.440 --> 35:38.640]  No. No, I don't.
[35:41.580 --> 35:43.340]  I don't think they were disturbed by
[35:43.340 --> 35:43.780]  the sound.
[35:55.260 --> 35:57.220]  I will say, Gavin,
[35:57.220 --> 35:58.780]  and I assume it's just
[35:58.780 --> 36:01.160]  your stream, I have no
[36:01.160 --> 36:01.380]  audio.
[36:03.960 --> 36:05.300]  Oh. As long as
[36:05.300 --> 36:07.100]  you're picking up, as long as it's recording
[36:08.560 --> 36:09.040]  audio...
[36:09.040 --> 36:10.820]  It definitely is. Okay.
[36:11.280 --> 36:11.720]  That's fine.
[36:12.880 --> 36:15.260]  I can pretend to be Geoff playing any game that
[36:15.260 --> 36:15.620]  we're doing.
[36:18.380 --> 36:20.700]  Yeah, how do I get my preview audio to come out of OBS?
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.280]  Do you use OBS? No.
[36:23.040 --> 36:24.440]  I just use the Elgato.
[36:29.460 --> 36:31.320]  Once again, I think it's rude that you don't get an
[36:31.320 --> 36:33.460]  umbrella. Angus Hogging
[36:33.460 --> 36:34.820]  it. Yeah.
[36:35.760 --> 36:37.320]  And I feel like someone should come
[36:37.320 --> 36:38.360]  rushing out with one at least.
[36:41.380 --> 36:43.280]  I never had a clear
[36:43.280 --> 36:44.980]  translucent umbrella.
[36:45.840 --> 36:46.600]  Wish I did.
[36:47.500 --> 36:49.280]  I feel like it'd be cool once, and then
[36:49.280 --> 36:51.020]  it'd have a ton of water stains all over it.
[36:51.720 --> 36:52.720]  Does water stain?
[36:54.440 --> 36:54.840]  Yeah.
[36:56.040 --> 36:56.600]  Does it?
[36:59.700 --> 37:01.040]  You never seen like a bunch of
[37:01.960 --> 37:03.700]  water drips dried onto a car
[37:03.700 --> 37:05.960]  or from the dishwasher, it's all over your
[37:05.960 --> 37:06.520]  cutlery?
[37:07.820 --> 37:09.420]  Yeah, I guess I have on cutlery.
[37:10.920 --> 37:11.660]  I guess I never
[37:11.660 --> 37:13.420]  really thought about it being a water stain.
[37:14.300 --> 37:15.580]  I mean, I don't think it's the actual water,
[37:15.700 --> 37:16.500]  it's what was in the water.
[37:26.100 --> 37:27.700]  I shut the door on my effect.
[37:30.040 --> 37:30.440]  Woo!
[37:32.260 --> 37:33.340]  This game is good.
[37:33.460 --> 37:35.760]  Even when it's not trying to be, this game is good.
[37:37.220 --> 37:39.080]  Am I allowed to pull out a gun right here, do you think?
[37:39.540 --> 37:40.380]  No way!
[37:43.120 --> 37:44.820]  I think it's a situation where
[37:45.480 --> 37:47.340]  everyone is assumed to be packing,
[37:47.500 --> 37:49.020]  but you just don't pull it out.
[37:53.520 --> 37:53.920]  What?!
[37:55.940 --> 37:56.740]  That's crazy.
[38:00.800 --> 38:01.280]  What?
[38:02.640 --> 38:03.300]  You just
[38:03.300 --> 38:04.020]  put it down?
[38:05.540 --> 38:06.480]  Oh no!
[38:08.320 --> 38:09.020]  I picked it up again.
[38:09.240 --> 38:09.580]  Okay.
[38:11.680 --> 38:12.920]  It made the guards go,
[38:13.080 --> 38:14.420]  and I picked it up later.
[38:15.360 --> 38:16.040]  That's fine.
[38:24.960 --> 38:26.120]  You've been seen!
[38:26.120 --> 38:28.000]  At least you know where to get rid of the tapes.
[38:28.900 --> 38:30.320]  Oh, you're just cutting them off!
[38:30.440 --> 38:31.220]  Well, you know.
[38:31.460 --> 38:32.300]  Get a move on, Angus.
[38:38.500 --> 38:39.920]  Whenever I hear Angus,
[38:40.020 --> 38:41.300]  I just assume red hair.
[38:42.680 --> 38:44.380]  Like, I get an image in my head of what
[38:44.380 --> 38:46.120]  Angus looks like, and it's never
[38:46.120 --> 38:47.860]  what Angus actually looks like.
[38:48.840 --> 38:50.280]  You just think stereotypical
[38:50.280 --> 38:50.940]  Scotsman.
[38:51.420 --> 38:54.160]  Yeah, I go like, how to train your dragon
[38:54.160 --> 38:56.500]  level of cartoonish Scotsman.
[39:04.780 --> 39:05.300]  Damage!
[39:11.460 --> 39:14.200]  Are there any people that you think you could
[39:14.200 --> 39:15.600]  identify by name?
[39:16.200 --> 39:18.060]  That they look like? Do you think there's a name
[39:18.060 --> 39:19.840]  that often the person looks like it?
[39:20.760 --> 39:21.040]  Yeah.
[39:21.040 --> 39:23.040]  Like, if I took five photos
[39:23.040 --> 39:25.180]  of people that were
[39:25.180 --> 39:27.320]  named Angus, and put five photos
[39:27.320 --> 39:29.100]  of people not named Angus, do you think you could
[39:29.100 --> 39:31.080]  correctly identify the five Anguses?
[39:31.320 --> 39:32.620]  Yeah, like, find the Ang guy?
[39:32.880 --> 39:34.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:38.580 --> 39:40.480]  Who wants to be an Ang guy?
[39:41.900 --> 39:44.620]  I think I can also identify Gileses
[39:44.620 --> 39:45.000]  as well.
[39:47.320 --> 39:48.280]  Gileses? Really?
[39:48.820 --> 39:49.120]  Yeah.
[39:50.220 --> 39:51.260]  I've never seen a
[39:51.260 --> 39:53.600]  Giles that doesn't look like one.
[39:53.820 --> 39:54.660]  By what spelling?
[39:55.800 --> 39:56.680]  G-I-L-E-S
[39:56.680 --> 39:57.460]  Okay.
[39:58.720 --> 40:00.080]  We're gonna try this out.
[40:03.540 --> 40:05.190]  I'm gonna start sourcing Gileses.
[40:09.120 --> 40:10.040]  Me, me, me!
[40:22.880 --> 40:23.360]  Hmm.
[40:23.360 --> 40:25.220]  Gotta say, not a lot of famous people named Giles.
[40:26.160 --> 40:26.440]  Hmm.
[40:27.440 --> 40:28.400]  Giles Brandreth?
[40:30.980 --> 40:32.740]  Brandreth? What's his name? I don't know.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.300]  Has to be first name, right?
[40:36.060 --> 40:36.540]  Yeah.
[40:37.940 --> 40:39.040]  Giles from Buffy?
[40:49.120 --> 40:49.200]  Yeah.
[40:57.730 --> 41:00.870]  I bet you he's gonna have a bunch of clones of himself.
[41:04.390 --> 41:05.250]  You might be right.
[41:10.150 --> 41:11.770]  That would be a fun action movie.
[41:12.930 --> 41:14.710]  Just like a film...
[41:14.710 --> 41:16.110]  I guess it's Terminator, isn't it?
[41:16.230 --> 41:17.910]  I was gonna say a bunch of Arnold Schwarzeneggers.
[41:18.050 --> 41:18.790]  It's just Terminator.
[41:20.530 --> 41:22.950]  They could do one with Van Damme.
[41:23.570 --> 41:25.830]  Oh, I could see, yeah, Van Damme as Terminator.
[41:26.110 --> 41:26.470]  Absolutely.
[41:28.290 --> 41:30.590]  Robert Patrick-like Terminator.
[41:36.670 --> 41:39.610]  Did you know that they made a double dragon movie
[41:39.610 --> 41:41.150]  with Robert Patrick in it?
[41:42.510 --> 41:42.630]  No.
[41:43.030 --> 41:45.390]  I didn't know that they made a double dragon movie,
[41:45.470 --> 41:46.690]  but I saw a thing about Hal.
[41:46.690 --> 41:48.750]  He is the main villain
[41:48.750 --> 41:50.810]  in Double Dragon just because of his
[41:50.810 --> 41:52.950]  role in Terminator 2.
[41:56.210 --> 42:02.130]  Alright, let's do
[42:02.620 --> 42:03.510]  all accidents.
[42:04.690 --> 42:06.490]  I predict you get...
[42:06.490 --> 42:08.130]  Well, you're gonna...
[42:08.130 --> 42:09.230]  How do I do Eagle Vision?
[42:09.930 --> 42:10.650]  Right bumper.
[42:12.950 --> 42:14.070]  I predict
[42:14.670 --> 42:15.790]  that you burn the...
[42:15.790 --> 42:17.930]  I think you get 8 accident kills.
[42:19.570 --> 42:19.990]  When I pressed
[42:19.990 --> 42:20.950]  right bumper there, I was like,
[42:21.030 --> 42:23.450]  I'm 90% sure he's right and I'm 10%
[42:24.330 --> 42:26.090]  thinking maybe it's the throw grenade button
[42:26.090 --> 42:26.870]  and he's trying to kill me.
[42:33.570 --> 42:34.670]  This level's wild.
[42:35.290 --> 42:37.850]  I like the direction they went with in this game.
[42:38.170 --> 42:38.570]  Yeah.
[42:38.570 --> 42:39.130]  Yeah.
[42:42.270 --> 42:42.710]  Oh.
[42:43.990 --> 42:46.230]  There's two of them on this little cycle.
[42:46.350 --> 42:48.550]  Oh, you get to go through each thing
[42:48.550 --> 42:50.150]  and see their different training?
[42:50.970 --> 42:51.690]  That's smart.
[42:54.110 --> 42:56.010]  I really got excited when I saw
[42:56.010 --> 42:58.450]  there were 13 of them and just completely broke
[42:58.450 --> 42:59.470]  away from the narrative.
[43:01.490 --> 43:03.950]  Should I go around the whole tour or should I just crack on?
[43:04.810 --> 43:06.430]  Uh, I feel like the tour
[43:06.430 --> 43:08.310]  will probably show you how to accident
[43:08.310 --> 43:09.410]  kill all of them.
[43:10.350 --> 43:12.690]  We know this one already because of my failing.
[43:15.230 --> 43:16.070]  Increased temp.
[43:16.570 --> 43:16.910]  Yep.
[43:19.610 --> 43:22.170]  Don't feel like that should be a suspicious action.
[43:23.130 --> 43:24.710]  I feel like it should be okay.
[43:27.330 --> 43:28.690]  How do I
[43:28.690 --> 43:30.670]  get a researcher
[43:30.670 --> 43:31.270]  outfit?
[43:32.770 --> 43:34.170]  Oh, you know what you should do?
[43:35.210 --> 43:36.210]  You should put
[43:36.210 --> 43:38.290]  markers in your own house of what
[43:38.290 --> 43:40.190]  would be considered a suspicious activity.
[43:43.330 --> 43:44.350]  I would not put
[43:44.350 --> 43:45.810]  one on my thermostat, personally.
[43:46.530 --> 43:48.250]  No. Maybe on, like, the
[43:48.250 --> 43:50.110]  gas line? Oh, gas line!
[43:50.230 --> 43:52.390]  Definitely suspicious. Breaker box?
[43:53.030 --> 43:53.590]  Breaker, yep.
[43:58.580 --> 44:00.860]  I would have oven as suspicious if
[44:00.860 --> 44:03.120]  I didn't view you as somebody who should be using
[44:03.120 --> 44:04.080]  the oven in my home.
[44:06.680 --> 44:07.000]  Okay.
[44:07.140 --> 44:08.060]  So I've got to be able to crush
[44:08.060 --> 44:09.420]  one with the barbell.
[44:10.200 --> 44:11.400]  Or the bar... what's that called?
[44:12.420 --> 44:12.720]  Dumbbell?
[44:13.820 --> 44:16.120]  Oh, I don't know. Isn't it the dumbbell
[44:16.120 --> 44:17.080]  one you pick up with one hand?
[44:17.780 --> 44:20.400]  You can, yeah. You've got kettlebells.
[44:20.560 --> 44:22.140]  You've got a medicine ball over there.
[44:23.200 --> 44:23.920]  Buddy, look who's been
[44:23.920 --> 44:25.740]  hitting the gym. You've got weight plates.
[44:27.440 --> 44:28.220]  Oh, can you just
[44:28.220 --> 44:29.300]  mush in with the wall?
[44:30.900 --> 44:32.080]  Walk up to the panel.
[44:32.080 --> 44:33.540]  See if there's a prompt on the panel.
[44:34.020 --> 44:34.720]  Is there a mush button?
[44:35.720 --> 44:37.540]  I need to become a researcher so bad.
[44:37.780 --> 44:38.140]  Yeah.
[44:39.140 --> 44:40.860]  Where is that outfit?
[44:41.660 --> 44:43.820]  That guard is just really watching.
[44:44.560 --> 44:45.380]  Oh, where'd the other one go?
[44:45.600 --> 44:46.180]  Oh, he's in the shitter!
[44:50.060 --> 44:51.640]  Shit him! Shit him!
[44:52.040 --> 44:53.700]  Shit him! Get him!
[44:54.380 --> 44:54.840]  Yeah!
[44:58.380 --> 44:59.260]  Get that outfit.
[44:59.260 --> 44:59.400]  Shit.
[45:02.600 --> 45:04.140]  Now flush the body.
[45:05.640 --> 45:06.320]  Come here.
[45:07.820 --> 45:08.900]  Get in there.
[45:12.120 --> 45:13.940]  I assume no one else will go in?
[45:14.700 --> 45:15.480]  Uh, yeah.
[45:16.700 --> 45:18.780]  I mean, who is bold
[45:18.780 --> 45:19.980]  enough to shit at work?
[45:28.120 --> 45:29.680]  Is he suspicious at all?
[45:30.920 --> 45:31.500]  Nope.
[45:32.080 --> 45:33.740]  That's good. Keep the pose.
[45:35.080 --> 45:36.020]  You're done.
[45:40.080 --> 45:41.900]  I don't have no hair left.
[45:45.340 --> 45:46.240]  That's right.
[45:47.100 --> 45:49.600]  Didn't know I was bold until you turned around.
[45:49.720 --> 45:51.280]  Recognize my baldness.
[45:52.120 --> 45:53.880]  Operate trash compactor.
[45:55.460 --> 45:56.320]  Is there anyone around?
[45:56.940 --> 45:58.220]  No, I think you're good.
[46:00.300 --> 46:01.700]  Oh, you control it.
[46:04.580 --> 46:05.320]  Go the other way.
[46:11.180 --> 46:11.820]  He's blindfolded.
[46:12.480 --> 46:13.900]  So I can just crush him
[46:13.900 --> 46:15.360]  or open him to the point where he falls?
[46:15.560 --> 46:16.560]  I guess so.
[46:16.820 --> 46:17.760]  Let's go for the crush.
[46:20.820 --> 46:21.140]  Uh...
[46:21.140 --> 46:23.560]  He's like, no, I don't...
[46:23.560 --> 46:24.800]  He's like, uh...
[46:24.800 --> 46:25.540]  I go the other way.
[46:26.260 --> 46:26.560]  Oh!
[46:26.560 --> 46:26.820]  Oh!
[46:27.840 --> 46:28.320]  Oh!
[46:32.140 --> 46:33.100]  Oh, no!
[46:35.220 --> 46:37.060]  Oh, there's fire beneath it!
[46:37.560 --> 46:38.380]  Oh, shit!
[46:42.770 --> 46:43.090]  Wait.
[46:43.870 --> 46:44.930]  What am I supposed to be seeing?
[46:45.010 --> 46:47.610]  The fact that he's...
[46:47.610 --> 46:50.050]  Was that like a moment to blow up the tank, maybe?
[46:51.170 --> 46:51.650]  Maybe?
[46:51.990 --> 46:52.410]  Yeah.
[46:57.020 --> 46:57.980]  That was...
[46:57.980 --> 46:58.540]  Great.
[46:59.020 --> 47:01.440]  Oh, did they just, like, walk? He walked in.
[47:02.360 --> 47:04.140]  Ah, he, like, walked in front
[47:04.140 --> 47:05.700]  of the target, maybe. I don't know.
[47:06.040 --> 47:06.380]  Ah.
[47:08.580 --> 47:10.060]  Yeah, maybe I should have snuck a little
[47:10.060 --> 47:11.100]  bomb behind this.
[47:11.720 --> 47:12.160]  Oh!
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.180]  Exploding golf ball.
[47:19.210 --> 47:20.770]  Oh, can you walk up to the targets?
[47:30.420 --> 47:31.340]  What are those?
[47:32.640 --> 47:33.360]  Exploding golf balls?
[47:35.200 --> 47:35.560]  Yeah.
[47:37.460 --> 47:37.860]  Ah.
[47:42.510 --> 47:43.690]  Very suspicious there.
[47:44.850 --> 47:45.810]  Yeah, how do I do that
[47:45.810 --> 47:47.510]  without... So he'll walk over.
[47:51.140 --> 47:52.380]  Grab a golf ball.
[47:59.460 --> 47:59.840]  So is he gonna
[47:59.840 --> 48:00.740]  shoot it out of the air?
[48:02.300 --> 48:03.420]  I think that's what we missed.
[48:03.420 --> 48:04.500]  Oh, he's gonna shoot it on his head.
[48:07.040 --> 48:07.840]  Hell yeah!
[48:07.960 --> 48:08.120]  Okay.
[48:09.340 --> 48:12.100]  Wait, who did that?
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.460]  And then he'll shoot it.
[48:17.180 --> 48:18.700]  Yeah, I just didn't see him with a gun.
[48:23.550 --> 48:24.970]  Doing my research.
[48:26.690 --> 48:27.910]  Well, you know where the exploding
[48:27.910 --> 48:28.650]  golf ball is.
[48:30.210 --> 48:31.130]  Loop around.
[48:35.130 --> 48:36.010]  Researching here.
[48:36.730 --> 48:37.550]  Don't mind me.
[48:38.070 --> 48:39.010]  Oh, get him!
[48:39.710 --> 48:40.590]  Give him a heart attack.
[48:41.290 --> 48:43.030]  No, not him. On the bikes.
[48:43.030 --> 48:43.050]  On the bikes.
[48:52.180 --> 48:54.160]  I'm just telling the Van Dabs what to do.
[48:58.300 --> 48:59.600]  Oh, you're gonna boil him?
[49:00.120 --> 49:00.960]  I'll boil that one.
[49:03.680 --> 49:04.440]  And then...
[49:04.440 --> 49:06.140]  Oh, I can make him drink.
[49:07.300 --> 49:07.860]  Poisonize him.
[49:08.280 --> 49:09.480]  Should I send him back to the sauna
[49:09.480 --> 49:11.180]  or should I send this one to the bench press?
[49:11.340 --> 49:12.520]  I think you gotta bench him.
[49:16.320 --> 49:18.560]  Easy. Easy. I got feelings.
[49:18.860 --> 49:20.480]  Bench press. Now.
[49:20.900 --> 49:21.420]  Okay, okay.
[49:22.560 --> 49:23.880]  Okay, okay.
[49:26.960 --> 49:28.060]  Oh, you can probably
[49:28.060 --> 49:29.520]  strangle him with the bar.
[49:30.980 --> 49:31.840]  Be a spotter.
[49:36.080 --> 49:36.380]  Hey.
[49:37.560 --> 49:40.160]  I'm sure this guard is gonna see me crush his throat.
[49:42.000 --> 49:42.600]  Uh...
[49:45.340 --> 49:46.240]  Yeah, that
[49:46.240 --> 49:47.740]  seems like it would be a problem.
[49:52.470 --> 49:55.270]  See if you get a warning sign, though, for it.
[49:55.270 --> 49:56.690]  No, I don't. Kill.
[49:57.550 --> 49:58.930]  Oh! Oh, no!
[49:59.430 --> 49:59.610]  Shit!
[50:01.410 --> 50:01.850]  Gavin!
[50:04.770 --> 50:06.070]  You didn't even kill him!
[50:08.410 --> 50:09.330]  He's got a gun!
[50:11.230 --> 50:13.010]  Be careful of the one in the sauna!
[50:15.070 --> 50:15.910]  Boil him! Boil him!
[50:15.910 --> 50:16.770]  Oh, shit!
[50:17.370 --> 50:19.550]  No! He didn't see you!
[50:22.470 --> 50:23.430]  What are you doing?
[50:23.590 --> 50:25.610]  Okay. Go, go, go, go, go.
[50:28.920 --> 50:30.520]  Swap your outfits. Yeah!
[50:33.720 --> 50:35.120]  Oh, he saw you.
[50:35.360 --> 50:35.900]  He's coming.
[50:38.180 --> 50:39.200]  Oh, shit.
[50:41.420 --> 50:42.820]  They might think that's you.
[50:42.940 --> 50:43.800]  Outside of the hair.
[50:43.800 --> 50:45.800]  The hair really gives it away.
[50:47.860 --> 50:48.700]  Bald him.
[50:50.340 --> 50:51.200]  Oh, shit!
[50:52.140 --> 50:53.000]  Holy shit!
[50:53.420 --> 50:54.560]  You beat up Van Damme!
[50:55.440 --> 50:56.300]  Okay, you only got...
[50:56.300 --> 50:58.380]  You got eight bullets left.
[51:01.980 --> 51:03.260]  Uh-oh.
[51:05.100 --> 51:06.860]  I mean, it seems pretty contained.
[51:07.900 --> 51:08.840]  All things considered.
[51:09.560 --> 51:11.240]  Nope! Nope! Never mind!
[51:11.240 --> 51:12.180]  Never mind!
[51:14.560 --> 51:15.720]  Six bullets left.
[51:16.600 --> 51:17.240]  I gotta get out of here.
[51:18.240 --> 51:19.520]  We're getting all kinds of tits up.
[51:19.880 --> 51:20.080]  Yep.
[51:21.040 --> 51:23.340]  You wanna pop into your vision cam for a minute to see if they're coming?
[51:25.060 --> 51:27.380]  It seems like they're kind of locked in.
[51:27.440 --> 51:28.120]  I think you're okay.
[51:29.700 --> 51:30.980]  Shitty. Shitty death.
[51:32.760 --> 51:33.420]  What'd I miss?
[51:34.060 --> 51:34.780]  Hey, it's Angus.
[51:35.260 --> 51:36.040]  Hey, Angus. What's going on?
[51:38.620 --> 51:39.100]  Wow.
[51:39.180 --> 51:39.940]  Wow, that really kicked off.
[51:40.060 --> 51:42.400]  There was a guard right there. He didn't even give me an exclamation.
[51:42.540 --> 51:43.820]  I thought that was a bit cheap.
[51:44.900 --> 51:46.040]  I can't believe
[51:46.040 --> 51:48.240]  that it didn't disturb more things.
[51:50.380 --> 51:51.800]  Like, all the shooting somehow
[51:51.800 --> 51:54.160]  was contained to just that block.
[51:55.640 --> 51:58.140]  Well, it's not gone silent assassin.
[51:58.840 --> 51:59.220]  No.
[52:00.800 --> 52:01.500]  But what?
[52:01.580 --> 52:04.180]  You killed one so far via the accident?
[52:04.180 --> 52:05.820]  Almost few.
[52:07.140 --> 52:08.100]  Oh, that's the
[52:08.100 --> 52:09.600]  ventilation room, isn't it?
[52:10.040 --> 52:12.160]  Yeah, and it's the golf ball room.
[52:13.400 --> 52:14.580]  Golf ball room.
[52:15.700 --> 52:16.300]  Oh, he's just doing
[52:16.300 --> 52:16.800]  the splits.
[52:20.040 --> 52:22.360]  Oh, you can make the windows
[52:22.360 --> 52:23.720]  you can make the windows
[52:25.920 --> 52:26.720]  shade them.
[52:27.920 --> 52:28.520]  Yeah.
[52:32.110 --> 52:32.710]  Oops.
[52:33.490 --> 52:33.890]  Oh.
[52:40.590 --> 52:40.990]  Oh.
[52:43.910 --> 52:44.550]  I was gonna
[52:44.550 --> 52:46.570]  shoot his penis while he was doing the splits.
[52:51.700 --> 52:52.920]  Can I gas this room?
[52:57.390 --> 52:58.290]  Barton to the vent.
[52:58.990 --> 52:59.690]  Yeah, where's the vent?
[53:01.950 --> 53:04.250]  I swear that's a room you can gas.
[53:04.730 --> 53:04.990]  Yeah.
[53:08.580 --> 53:09.580]  I don't know if you'd be able
[53:09.580 --> 53:10.460]  to syringe
[53:10.460 --> 53:10.660]  syringe
[53:13.520 --> 53:14.320]  a gas
[53:14.320 --> 53:14.800]  vent.
[53:19.120 --> 53:19.520]  Hmm.
[53:21.600 --> 53:22.000]  Hmm.
[53:22.460 --> 53:22.840]  Hmm.
[53:24.440 --> 53:24.840]  Potentially
[53:27.820 --> 53:28.960]  No, I was gonna say
[53:28.960 --> 53:30.340]  no. Yeah, I just
[53:30.340 --> 53:30.860]  Oh!
[53:32.580 --> 53:33.660]  Well, that goes somewhere.
[53:34.380 --> 53:35.200]  Don't he have a screwdriver?
[53:36.600 --> 53:38.980]  I guess I could just blip him in the back of the head.
[53:39.680 --> 53:40.680]  Yeah, I mean, I don't
[53:40.680 --> 53:42.820]  you know, as far as accidents
[53:42.820 --> 53:44.720]  go, I don't think
[53:44.720 --> 53:46.600]  that's very accidental, but that's okay.
[53:46.900 --> 53:46.940]  Alright.
[53:48.440 --> 53:50.760]  Alright, I'll come back
[53:50.760 --> 53:52.820]  to him in about five minutes.
[53:56.860 --> 53:57.780]  Oh, is this
[53:57.780 --> 54:00.020]  Oh, what's over there?
[54:01.140 --> 54:02.700]  Can I make him karate chop himself
[54:02.700 --> 54:03.120]  to death?
[54:04.180 --> 54:05.180]  Oh, challenge!
[54:10.860 --> 54:11.860]  Thank you.
[54:11.880 --> 54:14.420]  I'm strong. Why? Because I eat
[54:14.420 --> 54:15.640]  a lot of legumes.
[54:16.120 --> 54:17.060]  Did he initiate it?
[54:17.920 --> 54:18.400]  Yeah.
[54:20.880 --> 54:21.920]  Did he accept?
[54:24.000 --> 54:24.980]  Oh, here we go.
[54:26.940 --> 54:29.540]  Oh, hell yeah.
[54:29.760 --> 54:30.380]  Bring it on, son.
[54:31.920 --> 54:34.540]  I'm just in a coat. Should I not be dressed better for this?
[54:35.500 --> 54:36.020]  Oh!
[54:36.020 --> 54:36.580]  Oh!
[54:38.040 --> 54:39.740]  Yes, you're gonna die right on his foot?
[54:42.680 --> 54:43.280]  Get him!
[54:45.480 --> 54:45.900]  Yeah!
[54:47.340 --> 54:47.740]  Come on, then.
[54:48.140 --> 54:49.760]  Come on, then. You want a piece of this?
[54:51.480 --> 54:52.320]  Oh, mash, mash,
[54:52.420 --> 54:52.940]  mash, mash!
[54:53.360 --> 54:55.760]  In the throat! Oh, Jesus!
[54:56.320 --> 54:57.140]  Oh, I killed
[54:58.120 --> 54:59.520]  one punch in the throat?
[55:00.760 --> 55:01.600]  Is he dead?
[55:01.880 --> 55:03.100]  I Van Dammed him?
[55:06.020 --> 55:07.680]  I wonder if he does that in one of his movies.
[55:07.960 --> 55:10.320]  There's like a famous throat kill. Oh, I assume so.
[55:10.580 --> 55:11.340]  Oh, God.
[55:13.120 --> 55:14.100]  Oh, that's so
[55:14.100 --> 55:14.560]  risky!
[55:15.460 --> 55:17.360]  Well, I don't want to leave him on the...
[55:17.360 --> 55:20.320]  That's fair, but man...
[55:21.500 --> 55:22.540]  That was insane.
[55:23.420 --> 55:24.180]  Yeah, that was cool.
[55:29.880 --> 55:30.160]  Oh!
[55:32.400 --> 55:33.380]  Should've fought him with this.
[55:35.500 --> 55:37.800]  You go kill somebody else with it.
[55:40.610 --> 55:41.830]  Oh, server room?
[55:42.650 --> 55:43.650]  Man, they just let me
[55:43.650 --> 55:45.570]  go anywhere. Yeah, you can just explore.
[55:48.570 --> 55:49.750]  Stealth kill with the katana.
[55:51.810 --> 55:53.450]  Okay, so that's...
[55:55.770 --> 55:57.650]  Oh, is now the time for golf ball put in?
[55:58.370 --> 55:59.110]  It could be.
[55:59.490 --> 56:00.270]  Are they not there?
[56:02.090 --> 56:03.350]  One person over there.
[56:04.510 --> 56:05.590]  Just angle it.
[56:08.930 --> 56:09.430]  Oh!
[56:10.470 --> 56:11.190]  Oh, shit.
[56:13.490 --> 56:16.070]  Run, run, run, run, run!
[56:17.690 --> 56:19.530]  You're still just holding the katana?
[56:19.990 --> 56:20.290]  Yeah.
[56:24.730 --> 56:25.690]  Okay, let's go
[56:25.690 --> 56:27.450]  and maybe go and do the dancing one.
[56:28.990 --> 56:29.870]  Where is that one?
[56:30.830 --> 56:31.750]  Oh, he's doing it!
[56:33.070 --> 56:33.970]  He's dancing!
[56:34.290 --> 56:34.910]  He's doing it!
[56:36.270 --> 56:36.950]  Are they
[56:36.950 --> 56:37.650]  going to let you through?
[56:38.950 --> 56:39.350]  No!
[56:40.150 --> 56:41.990]  Drop it, drop it, drop it!
[56:42.390 --> 56:43.610]  Oh my god!
[56:45.650 --> 56:47.350]  Okay, well that...
[56:47.350 --> 56:48.870]  I think that's fucked it.
[56:49.910 --> 56:51.050]  There's no way
[56:51.050 --> 56:52.970]  everyone has to be...
[56:52.970 --> 56:53.730]  Not on my watch!
[56:54.090 --> 56:55.190]  Come here, come here!
[56:56.230 --> 56:57.330]  Oh my god!
[57:00.690 --> 57:01.910]  You don't have the key!
[57:06.110 --> 57:07.170]  Where are you going?
[57:11.500 --> 57:11.860]  Oh!
[57:12.700 --> 57:14.220]  Things are going so well!
[57:18.120 --> 57:19.020]  Oh, my headphones went off.
[57:21.180 --> 57:21.900]  Are you there?
[57:22.240 --> 57:22.660]  Yeah, I'm here.
[57:22.980 --> 57:23.360]  Okay, cool.
[57:24.780 --> 57:26.060]  I was just saying, what's your plan?
[57:26.600 --> 57:28.260]  Uh, I panicked.
[57:29.020 --> 57:30.140]  Yeah, I saw that.
[57:34.020 --> 57:35.260]  There's no fucking way
[57:35.260 --> 57:36.920]  things are going back to normalcy.
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.260]  Are you kidding me?
[57:39.140 --> 57:40.700]  Ha ha ha ha!
[57:44.440 --> 57:45.340]  Oh, man.
[57:48.260 --> 57:49.040]  How?
[57:49.980 --> 57:51.440]  I fire one gun
[57:51.440 --> 57:53.280]  at a shooting range and the entire
[57:53.280 --> 57:54.580]  facility gets pissed.
[57:55.640 --> 57:57.340]  You're killing guys
[57:57.340 --> 57:59.260]  with katanas and they're firing heavy
[57:59.260 --> 58:01.600]  machine guns and it's all good.
[58:02.980 --> 58:03.380]  That's
[58:03.380 --> 58:04.060]  all good?
[58:05.640 --> 58:06.580]  You don't have a key still.
[58:06.580 --> 58:07.740]  Where's the key?
[58:08.180 --> 58:10.120]  The lead scientist was the one that had the key.
[58:16.730 --> 58:17.310]  This one?
[58:17.790 --> 58:20.690]  No, the lady that was giving the tour.
[58:25.510 --> 58:26.610]  You should maybe
[58:27.750 --> 58:28.950]  you should maybe
[58:31.610 --> 58:32.810]  initiate the glass.
[58:33.450 --> 58:34.890]  Oh, yeah, that works.
[58:35.110 --> 58:36.870]  Yeah, I mean, I wasn't going to say kill them.
[58:36.970 --> 58:39.910]  You could do that if you want, but there wasn't the glass switch.
[58:40.170 --> 58:40.750]  Ha ha ha!
[58:40.750 --> 58:42.530]  Oh, it slipped.
[58:42.790 --> 58:43.610]  Coughed and it slipped.
[58:48.020 --> 58:49.300]  Can I not do the glass?
[58:49.720 --> 58:51.120]  There was a prompt a minute ago
[58:51.120 --> 58:52.500]  before you shot them.
[58:53.040 --> 58:53.600]  Shit.
[58:54.220 --> 58:56.260]  I could have swore there was. Maybe there wasn't.
[58:57.640 --> 58:58.000]  Oh!
[59:01.820 --> 59:03.400]  I didn't know you could do that.
[59:04.580 --> 59:05.480]  That's awesome.
[59:06.000 --> 59:06.660]  The phone hacking?
[59:07.180 --> 59:07.540]  Yeah.
[59:10.040 --> 59:11.200]  That's very cool.
[59:11.200 --> 59:11.680]  Oops.
[59:15.820 --> 59:17.480]  They've recorded my legs!
[59:19.400 --> 59:20.720]  Uh oh, someone's noticed the situation.
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.580]  They didn't find my body, did they?
[59:24.700 --> 59:24.980]  Uh oh.
[59:27.000 --> 59:27.520]  Oh, no!
[59:33.650 --> 59:34.610]  How did Selkie?
[59:40.740 --> 59:41.500]  What's that?
[59:41.860 --> 59:42.760]  Oh, the katana again?
[59:42.760 --> 59:42.820]  The katana again?
[59:55.480 --> 59:57.120]  That's a meme, isn't it?
[59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.600]  I think he was dancing in something.
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.160]  I don't remember what he was dancing in.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:02.820]  Was it a commercial?
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.460]  Oh my god! It's stuck in!
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.960]  I feel like I need more Van Damme references.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.340]  I don't fully appreciate this level.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.320]  So you got the real one, and then the six you can boil.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.300]  Okay.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.420]  You got the six, you can boil.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.260]  Alright, let's get down to the boil hole.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.300]  Or was it five?
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.000]  I guess it's five.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.900]  Where's the boil zone?
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.640]  The boil zone, I think, should be to your left?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:34.800]  Yeah.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.080]  Uh oh.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.600]  Oh no!
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.240]  Body found!
[01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.610]  Boop boop boop boop boop boop.
[01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.790]  Oh, she's
[01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:55.430]  investigating.
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.190]  I have no idea.
[01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.070]  They're investigating.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.740]  I think he's gonna fix it.
[01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.330]  I don't think they...
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:18.490]  Oh.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.220]  Okay.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.040]  Well, that solves that.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.820]  Okay, now you just gotta kill the real guy.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:39.920]  Let's get him.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.780]  How you gonna do it?
[01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.610]  Oh, you're shafting?
[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.790]  A little bit of shafting.
[01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.130]  Oh, there they all go.
[01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:51.330]  Boop.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.680]  Sneaking on up.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.380]  When was the last time you climbed
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:01.860]  a ladder?
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.140]  In real life?
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.080]  Yeah, in real life.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:06.760]  Yesterday.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.020]  Really?
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:08.720]  Yeah.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.060]  What were you doing on the ladder?
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.580]  I was on my roof.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:12.260]  Ah.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.800]  Recreationally, or like a job?
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.500]  No, there were some people
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.280]  who put Christmas lights up, and they
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.680]  took them off.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.800]  But they left a bunch of shit
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.260]  all over the roof. Idiots.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.800]  Bunch of, like, extension
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.100]  cords and just...
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.720]  They just left all the extension cords on your roof?
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.880]  They got one, like, trapped around a drainpipe
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.680]  and they just clearly couldn't be bothered to
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.560]  try and unwrap it.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.880]  Oh, that's incredible.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.660]  Okay, there's a lot of people finding a lot of my mess.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:43.140]  Yeah.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.380]  I would argue your run was better than mine.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.880]  I don't think that's true.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.360]  But that is kind of you to say.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.300]  Oh, there he is.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.540]  Alright, I need to get an outfit that doesn't
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.300]  have a naked man in the corner of the room.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.080]  Yeah.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.360]  Cause they're gonna find that body.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:04.500]  Ooh.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.400]  Is this the store the body room?
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:09.600]  Yup.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.660]  Oh, nice.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.540]  Little sneak.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.460]  Didn't get to poison anyone.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.280]  Bit disappointing.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.760]  No, but...
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.540]  Almost got...
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.340]  Oh my god.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.420]  I almost killed someone with a
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.060]  barbell. Oh, that's the drink.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:27.640]  Damn it.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:30.860]  Um...
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.360]  I mean, you could still
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.000]  poison it.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.140]  I could.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.080]  Silly guard mask.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:41.800]  Hell yeah.
[01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:48.350]  I was close to being able to
[01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:49.810]  do this well. You were.
[01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:52.450]  And then it fell apart with the
[01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:54.650]  bell. Fell apart real nice.
[01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.310]  Yeah. Barbell.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.660]  You did put the explosive golf ball
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.540]  with the other golf balls. That was pretty cool.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.700]  Oh yeah, did that ever do anything or did that guy already die?
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.640]  I think that guy already died.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:12.860]  That's a bummer.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.100]  How would that scientist
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.980]  recognize me
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.680]  through this? I don't understand that.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.460]  You can just sense it.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.380]  It's like his Angus.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.140]  Kazan guy.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.140]  Did I blow my original cover?
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.180]  Yes.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.300]  But you could be Angus.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.460]  Is that Angus?
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.300]  Yeah. Isn't that Angus?
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.320]  Pretty sure that's Angus.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.660]  I'm gonna wait for him to do the splits.
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.480]  Okay.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.680]  I should take a photo
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.300]  of it.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.020]  Oh, he's splitting.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.900]  Use camera.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:17.700]  Yeah.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.680]  Oh shit. No.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.820]  I got one bullet. No.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.500]  Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.380]  Oh.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.240]  You're out of bullets.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.360]  Gavin.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.740]  Where's his gun? Grab it.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.440]  Why? Why? Why?
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.420]  Oh, it's gonna pop off.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.360]  It's gonna pop off.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.140]  Oh man.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.580]  Can you dress as him?
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:56.700]  I don't know.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.300]  Getting rid of the evidence. Smart.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.520]  I like it.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.960]  I feel like I didn't even shoot his dick. He just shot up like a rocket.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.640]  Yeah, he did.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.280]  I don't even think that was your fault.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.040]  Oh.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.020]  How did he not immediately
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:13.620]  see you?
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:17.840]  Oh shit.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.060]  You turned the glass on.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:20.960]  That's pretty better for me, actually.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.360]  Final stand.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:30.460]  Oh.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:33.260]  Alright.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.620]  I was on the wrong shoulder. It threw me.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.880]  I mean, you can leave now, right?
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.340]  You just gotta get out of here.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.100]  Well, I haven't killed him yet.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.160]  He's still alive?
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.960]  Yeah, I just knocked him out.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.080]  Oh my god.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.240]  Wow, I almost died there.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:50.740]  Oh, that was scary.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.580]  Okay.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:06:59.140]  Who's next?
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.100]  You look kinda clear.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.580]  Him? Is he next?
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:04.180]  He's next.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.880]  You're taking him with you.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.700]  I'm gonna take him to the sauna.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.100]  Or the golf ball. I'm gonna take him somewhere.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.580]  Stop it.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.380]  You're treating these people like they're
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:28.880]  mosquitoes.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.500]  It's a bucket of balls.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.360]  Hahaha.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.840]  If you shoot the bucket,
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.680]  do you think it explodes?
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.600]  That's what I'm hoping.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.080]  Hahaha.
[01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:57.410]  I mean...
[01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.830]  That felt unnecessary,
[01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.310]  but once again,
[01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:01.970]  don't hate the move.
[01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.010]  He might have said something.
[01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.250]  Oh, is that weapon silenced?
[01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:09.290]  Yeah.
[01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:10.950]  Oh, that's crazy.
[01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.570]  Oh, that really helps.
[01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:17.270]  I guess that's why
[01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:19.810]  it didn't go crazy when they fired that before.
[01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:21.470]  Alright, let's have him do the splits
[01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:22.310]  around the golf ball.
[01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:23.610]  Hahaha.
[01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:27.850]  Oh, you're putting his balls on the ball.
[01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:29.390]  Ball to ball contact.
[01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:30.210]  Ball to ball.
[01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.770]  Hahaha.
[01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.010]  Oh, shit. I just shot him in the cock
[01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.570]  by accident.
[01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:45.750]  Son of a bitch.
[01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.210]  Oh, it doesn't look like it explodes.
[01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:47.850]  Anyway.
[01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:49.750]  That was a good try.
[01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:53.270]  You gotta get out of there.
[01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:57.290]  Oh.
[01:08:58.790 --> 01:08:59.310]  Wait.
[01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:00.970]  Really?
[01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:03.110]  There's no way. No!
[01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:05.250]  That's why I said,
[01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:06.450]  why don't you hack it with the phone?
[01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:08.550]  I didn't hear you say that.
[01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:10.570]  Oh my god.
[01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.590]  Hahaha.
[01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:14.150]  That's so easy.
[01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:16.110]  Hahaha.
[01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:18.510]  Holy shit.
[01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:21.210]  Well, hey, good job. You got some cool accident kills.
[01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:22.250]  That was fun.
[01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:24.490]  Yeah, what did I get? I got the...
[01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.790]  What did I get?
[01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:27.470]  You boiled him.
[01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:28.870]  Oh, you already did that.
[01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:31.150]  Oh, I smushed him.
[01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:33.510]  You did smush him. That was pretty good.
[01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:36.710]  Oh.
[01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.650]  All round.
[01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:39.290]  Just chaos both times?
[01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:40.850]  Absolute chaos.
[01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:43.750]  You were cleaner
[01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:44.550]  once again, though.
[01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.450]  I feel like, so far, I'm the one that
[01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:49.530]  keeps fucking this up. But next time,
[01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:51.870]  you'll go first, and maybe that'll help me
[01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:53.770]  get a little bit of a guide.
[01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:55.610]  Yeah, I'll go first next time.
[01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.890]  We're pretty close
[01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.290]  to the same level, I think.
[01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:01.670]  We're both black cats, at the very least.
[01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:03.750]  What level, what game was this in?
[01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:06.590]  Uh...
[01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:08.110]  Hit me...
[01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:09.330]  It was either 2 or 3.
[01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.110]  If it was 2, maybe my progress was in the other game.
[01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:13.070]  Maybe.
[01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.470]  Ooh, now I can dress like the Splitter.
[01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:17.870]  You got the suit. Oh, you got the
[01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.770]  kitchen. You unlocked
[01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:20.410]  so much.
[01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:23.810]  Well, that was a lot of fun, Kevin. We should do another
[01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:25.890]  target at some point, whenever they add a new
[01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:27.690]  one. Hopefully another fun celebrity one.
[01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:29.230]  Yeah, that was great, that one.
[01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:30.290]  I kind of want to do it again.
[01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:32.430]  I cannot wait to do this
[01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:34.510]  again with you. Thank you so much to everybody
[01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:36.470]  for watching. Make sure you check out
