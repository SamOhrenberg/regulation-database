[00:01.140 --> 00:02.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have been.
[00:02.960 --> 00:05.900]  Okay, we're rolling all around. You guys are looming.
[00:07.020 --> 00:08.800]  What do you mean? Watch this.
[00:09.900 --> 00:10.560]  You're hit.
[00:11.260 --> 00:11.980]  You idiot.
[00:12.340 --> 00:13.240]  You fool, Nick, you fool.
[00:13.740 --> 00:15.120]  Did you take damage for that, Nick?
[00:15.280 --> 00:17.340]  Mama, don't shake baby. Don't shake baby.
[00:17.820 --> 00:19.080]  Spin, spin baby.
[00:19.360 --> 00:20.280]  Spin baby.
[00:20.660 --> 00:21.640]  Spin baby.
[00:22.400 --> 00:23.880]  Dude, I'm at a rage.
[00:25.640 --> 00:26.900]  I can do nothing.
[00:27.300 --> 00:28.360]  Spin baby.
[00:28.360 --> 00:28.860]  Mercy.
[00:30.060 --> 00:30.460]  No!
[00:39.360 --> 00:40.960]  Welcome back to Repo.
[00:41.100 --> 00:43.600]  We're back. We're learning about whatever this energy stuff is.
[00:43.880 --> 00:46.520]  Just know that we're recording this right after we finished the last one
[00:46.520 --> 00:47.780]  because we really wanted to play it again.
[00:47.980 --> 00:49.620]  So we still don't know what this does.
[00:49.700 --> 00:51.000]  If you left a comment and you said,
[00:51.080 --> 00:52.860]  Oh, you got to do this thing with that. It really helps.
[00:52.980 --> 00:55.200]  We haven't seen it yet. I'm really sorry.
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.500]  But, but now is the time for us to go steal more stuff
[00:59.500 --> 01:00.820]  or whatever it is this game is about.
[01:00.900 --> 01:01.380]  I'm excited.
[01:08.270 --> 01:09.150]  All right, boys.
[01:09.610 --> 01:11.570]  We're at Swift Broom Academy.
[01:11.910 --> 01:12.710]  We're back.
[01:13.410 --> 01:14.250]  You guys ready?
[01:16.290 --> 01:16.770]  Guys?
[01:18.570 --> 01:19.050]  Guys?
[01:20.430 --> 01:21.530]  Why is nobody talking?
[01:29.350 --> 01:32.490]  I can't hear anyone.
[01:34.810 --> 01:37.230]  Is this?
[02:33.220 --> 02:34.000]  Oh, thank God.
[02:34.100 --> 02:34.760]  I can hear you guys.
[02:35.400 --> 02:37.200]  I wonder if that was a death level
[02:37.200 --> 02:40.120]  because the little tax man had a thing with the eyes
[02:40.120 --> 02:42.100]  and it had like he was putting the fingers in the ears maybe.
[02:42.880 --> 02:43.440]  Oh, really?
[02:43.700 --> 02:44.280]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[02:44.340 --> 02:45.380]  Look, and I was looking up at it.
[02:45.440 --> 02:46.700]  I was thinking maybe that's what he was telling us.
[02:46.840 --> 02:47.680]  I didn't see you say look.
[02:47.780 --> 02:48.000]  I'm sorry.
[02:48.200 --> 02:50.660]  I would have done it.
[02:51.440 --> 02:51.640]  What?
[02:51.960 --> 02:52.200]  I'm sorry.
[02:53.940 --> 02:54.680]  What do you say, Gavin?
[02:55.620 --> 02:56.440]  Yeah, he's being funny.
[02:56.540 --> 02:56.840]  I'm doing it.
[03:00.180 --> 03:00.980]  All right.
[03:01.060 --> 03:01.920]  So we have two.
[03:02.020 --> 03:03.140]  Oh my God.
[03:03.440 --> 03:05.540]  Oh, this is a thing inspired level.
[03:05.940 --> 03:06.700]  Oh, crazy.
[03:07.060 --> 03:08.340]  Geoff is going to love it.
[03:08.480 --> 03:08.800]  Okay.
[03:09.000 --> 03:10.720]  Have a look at the map.
[03:12.420 --> 03:14.960]  Let's kind of plan of attack this thing.
[03:15.000 --> 03:15.840]  Which way do we want to go?
[03:16.580 --> 03:17.200]  That's not the map.
[03:18.600 --> 03:19.460]  That's not a map.
[03:19.620 --> 03:20.460]  This is a map.
[03:20.460 --> 03:22.680]  Maybe there's a little room to the left.
[03:22.740 --> 03:25.080]  Let's just grab the small room first, and then we'll go.
[03:25.480 --> 03:25.840]  Okay.
[03:27.320 --> 03:27.680]  Monkey!
[03:29.520 --> 03:30.220]  Thank you.
[03:30.560 --> 03:31.640]  I'm going to put a monkey on the car.
[03:32.040 --> 03:32.180]  Yep.
[03:32.520 --> 03:32.700]  Yep.
[03:33.300 --> 03:33.820]  You missed.
[03:34.080 --> 03:34.200]  Oh.
[03:34.440 --> 03:34.660]  Oh.
[03:34.880 --> 03:35.240]  Back up.
[03:35.780 --> 03:36.100]  Uh oh.
[03:36.220 --> 03:36.520]  Watch out.
[03:36.620 --> 03:37.040]  You missed.
[03:37.560 --> 03:37.920]  Watch out.
[03:38.180 --> 03:38.320]  Watch out.
[03:39.180 --> 03:39.720]  What's that?
[03:40.140 --> 03:40.520]  What's that?
[03:40.620 --> 03:41.200]  It's a slicer.
[03:41.380 --> 03:41.920]  Is that a lawnmower?
[03:42.820 --> 03:43.420]  I think so.
[03:43.820 --> 03:44.740]  Don't cut the monkey up.
[03:45.600 --> 03:46.940]  Hey, what do you think happens if I do this?
[03:48.220 --> 03:49.640]  Oh, it's hurting him so bad.
[03:49.700 --> 03:50.340]  Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[03:50.340 --> 03:51.480]  Can you hit E to turn it off?
[03:52.480 --> 03:52.740]  No.
[03:53.400 --> 03:53.980]  Oh, God.
[03:54.040 --> 03:54.860]  Is he going to be like a monkey?
[03:55.260 --> 03:55.420]  Okay.
[03:55.680 --> 03:56.760]  Can we use it offensively?
[03:57.020 --> 03:57.080]  Cool.
[03:57.820 --> 03:58.140]  Oh.
[03:59.420 --> 04:00.060]  Oh, definitely.
[04:00.380 --> 04:02.220]  Or maybe it can cut through boxes or something.
[04:02.540 --> 04:02.660]  Here.
[04:03.160 --> 04:04.280]  We can keep it with us.
[04:04.300 --> 04:04.840]  Yeah, it's a good idea.
[04:05.040 --> 04:05.360]  We got this thing.
[04:05.380 --> 04:06.280]  I'm going to take a look back in here.
[04:06.800 --> 04:07.360]  Sorry, Gavin.
[04:07.460 --> 04:08.380]  I didn't mean to slice you up.
[04:08.420 --> 04:09.840]  I think that room is empty.
[04:09.900 --> 04:10.220]  It is.
[04:10.600 --> 04:10.800]  Oh.
[04:11.260 --> 04:11.500]  Yeah.
[04:11.760 --> 04:12.220]  Get out of the way.
[04:12.880 --> 04:14.300]  So we got to go straight or right?
[04:14.360 --> 04:15.920]  Well, right is a small room as well.
[04:16.600 --> 04:16.880]  Okay.
[04:16.960 --> 04:18.060]  Let's do it.
[04:18.800 --> 04:19.840]  Stay with the cart.
[04:20.500 --> 04:20.780]  Ooh.
[04:21.060 --> 04:21.800]  What's this?
[04:22.540 --> 04:23.200]  What you guys got?
[04:23.400 --> 04:24.120]  600 bucks.
[04:24.740 --> 04:25.200]  Here you go.
[04:25.980 --> 04:26.400]  Oh, God.
[04:26.400 --> 04:27.180]  Oh, it's an ocarina.
[04:27.320 --> 04:27.460]  Yeah.
[04:27.480 --> 04:30.480]  I have $25,000 here if somebody wants to help me grab it.
[04:30.660 --> 04:30.940]  Careful.
[04:31.020 --> 04:32.500]  Let's just go put it right on the thing.
[04:32.800 --> 04:33.040]  Yeah.
[04:33.360 --> 04:34.000]  Let's just do it.
[04:34.460 --> 04:35.020]  That's heavy.
[04:35.920 --> 04:36.800]  It can break.
[04:36.900 --> 04:37.660]  Get the cart out of the way.
[04:37.820 --> 04:38.560]  Get the cart out of the way.
[04:39.060 --> 04:39.500]  What do you mean?
[04:39.540 --> 04:39.880]  What do you mean?
[04:40.200 --> 04:41.140]  Get the cart out of the way.
[04:41.360 --> 04:41.760]  We're going to just take it straight back.
[04:41.880 --> 04:42.760]  We're just going to take it right back.
[04:42.860 --> 04:43.320]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:43.340 --> 04:44.580]  I got to put this chainsaw back in.
[04:44.640 --> 04:44.820]  Move.
[04:45.340 --> 04:46.720]  Move it back to where you were going.
[04:46.780 --> 04:47.140]  I'm sorry.
[04:47.300 --> 04:49.620]  I thought you guys were putting it in the cart.
[04:50.660 --> 04:52.920]  I'm trying to put it back in the cart so I can move the cart.
[04:53.020 --> 04:53.880]  No one can move the cart.
[04:54.220 --> 04:55.620]  Believe me, if we...
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.400]  Oh, careful.
[04:57.260 --> 04:57.580]  Careful?
[04:58.300 --> 05:00.500]  If we put it in the cart, it would have tipped out and broken.
[05:01.340 --> 05:01.980]  Yeah, it's...
[05:01.980 --> 05:03.000]  I'm going to lift it from the top.
[05:03.760 --> 05:04.240]  Hold it.
[05:04.580 --> 05:05.220]  I'll grab the bottom.
[05:05.320 --> 05:05.760]  I got the bottom.
[05:06.640 --> 05:07.540]  Let's just lay it down.
[05:07.640 --> 05:09.020]  He's got...
[05:09.020 --> 05:09.820]  There you go.
[05:10.200 --> 05:10.740]  There you go.
[05:10.740 --> 05:11.280]  There you go.
[05:11.380 --> 05:12.040]  All right, watch it.
[05:12.440 --> 05:13.320]  All right, Geoff, you got it.
[05:13.320 --> 05:14.400]  Just go straight back, Geoff.
[05:14.500 --> 05:15.380]  Just go straight back.
[05:15.640 --> 05:16.380]  Just like that.
[05:16.540 --> 05:16.900]  There you go.
[05:17.360 --> 05:18.300]  Oh, oh, oh, don't swing.
[05:18.380 --> 05:18.740]  Don't swing.
[05:19.040 --> 05:19.940]  Careful, careful, careful.
[05:20.540 --> 05:21.360]  Grab it by the end.
[05:21.720 --> 05:22.340]  Don't pivot.
[05:22.840 --> 05:23.660]  Geoff, Geoff, hang on.
[05:23.840 --> 05:24.200]  Hang on.
[05:24.220 --> 05:24.560]  Hang on.
[05:24.680 --> 05:25.100]  I got it.
[05:25.100 --> 05:25.460]  I got it.
[05:25.460 --> 05:25.860]  Let go, Geoff.
[05:26.000 --> 05:26.100]  Okay.
[05:26.440 --> 05:26.980]  All right, I'll let it go.
[05:27.240 --> 05:27.760]  There we go.
[05:27.960 --> 05:28.980]  I've also got it to help.
[05:29.780 --> 05:30.580]  Oh, the bat!
[05:30.800 --> 05:30.920]  Woo!
[05:35.830 --> 05:36.530]  Holy shit.
[05:41.100 --> 05:41.820]  Holy shit.
[05:43.940 --> 05:44.300]  Shit.
[05:44.300 --> 05:45.000]  I'm dead.
[05:50.140 --> 05:51.120]  Goddamn son of a bitch.
[05:52.560 --> 05:53.500]  Came out of nowhere.
[05:53.740 --> 05:57.320]  You shot them in the back as they were carrying a giant piece of furniture?
[05:59.380 --> 06:02.000]  Well, he shot Eric in the back.
[06:02.140 --> 06:02.940]  Oh, you lived!
[06:03.280 --> 06:03.800]  Geoff, where are you?
[06:04.000 --> 06:04.400]  Nice, Geoff.
[06:04.720 --> 06:05.700]  I'm on the other side.
[06:05.920 --> 06:06.280]  Okay.
[06:06.700 --> 06:07.400]  I'm coming out.
[06:08.020 --> 06:09.040]  I'm by Gavin's...
[06:09.040 --> 06:11.620]  Or I'm by Eric's disembodied head.
[06:12.060 --> 06:12.360]  Yeah.
[06:12.600 --> 06:12.980]  Okay, stop.
[06:13.080 --> 06:15.060]  Let's make sure we...
[06:20.480 --> 06:21.080]  All right.
[06:21.480 --> 06:22.400]  You can come this way.
[06:22.440 --> 06:22.660]  Okay.
[06:23.660 --> 06:24.160]  All right.
[06:25.060 --> 06:26.160]  Let's take his head to the thing.
[06:27.320 --> 06:28.420]  I thought you were...
[06:28.420 --> 06:30.080]  It was me being stupid, by the way.
[06:30.220 --> 06:31.800]  I thought you were...
[06:32.260 --> 06:33.340]  You thought me was him?
[06:33.520 --> 06:33.940]  Flashlight was him.
[06:34.400 --> 06:34.580]  Yeah.
[06:35.120 --> 06:36.180]  I just saw flashlight all of a sudden.
[06:36.320 --> 06:36.920]  I freaked.
[06:38.160 --> 06:38.520]  Okay.
[06:38.900 --> 06:39.560]  We'll get you, Eric.
[06:39.780 --> 06:40.780]  Gavin, we're going to have to have fun.
[06:41.300 --> 06:41.920]  We got it.
[06:41.940 --> 06:42.380]  We'll do it together.
[06:42.520 --> 06:42.840]  Let's not give it anymore.
[06:43.360 --> 06:43.560]  Okay.
[06:43.840 --> 06:45.300]  Oh, it got broken to shit.
[06:46.040 --> 06:46.620]  That's okay.
[06:46.680 --> 06:49.060]  I assume it was dropped when Eric was shot in the back.
[06:49.980 --> 06:50.860]  Lift it up more.
[06:51.120 --> 06:52.120]  There you go.
[06:52.480 --> 06:53.440]  Oh, we need to...
[06:53.440 --> 06:53.600]  Yeah.
[06:53.740 --> 06:54.820]  There you go.
[06:56.140 --> 06:56.540]  Okay.
[06:57.340 --> 06:57.760]  See you.
[07:01.840 --> 07:02.280]  All right.
[07:02.300 --> 07:03.020]  How much does that work?
[07:03.540 --> 07:04.440]  16, 8.
[07:05.960 --> 07:06.520]  So we...
[07:06.520 --> 07:07.200]  Oh, excuse me.
[07:08.560 --> 07:09.300]  Oh, you know what?
[07:09.360 --> 07:11.220]  I think we have to stand it up because otherwise it gets crushed.
[07:12.240 --> 07:12.640]  Okay.
[07:13.540 --> 07:14.340]  Oh, penis.
[07:18.160 --> 07:19.820]  Can someone finagle the bottom?
[07:19.940 --> 07:20.380]  Yeah, let me see.
[07:24.780 --> 07:26.080]  Took some damage.
[07:29.380 --> 07:30.780]  I think it's upside down.
[07:31.080 --> 07:31.880]  It doesn't matter.
[07:35.020 --> 07:35.640]  Let's see.
[07:35.700 --> 07:36.320]  Why is it...
[07:38.700 --> 07:41.560]  I'm pushing the end up, so the other end needs to be pulled down.
[07:42.820 --> 07:43.240]  Yeah.
[07:44.220 --> 07:44.660]  Okay.
[07:44.960 --> 07:45.760]  It should be...
[07:46.240 --> 07:47.280]  It's on Eric's head.
[07:49.340 --> 07:50.280]  I'm moving Eric's head.
[07:53.020 --> 07:53.580]  All right.
[07:53.620 --> 07:54.680]  I'm going to push up from the top.
[07:55.420 --> 07:55.700]  Okay.
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.480]  Eric's head is back on the thing.
[07:58.320 --> 08:00.000]  Is it on the railing or is it fine to let go?
[08:00.240 --> 08:00.800]  It's on the railing.
[08:00.800 --> 08:01.220]  It's on the railing.
[08:01.260 --> 08:02.060]  Pull it in just a little.
[08:05.060 --> 08:05.620]  Got it.
[08:05.900 --> 08:06.320]  There you go.
[08:06.520 --> 08:06.900]  There you go.
[08:07.800 --> 08:08.820]  Excellent work, fellas.
[08:08.940 --> 08:09.140]  All right.
[08:09.180 --> 08:09.980]  Now put that in.
[08:10.080 --> 08:10.860]  It should be enough.
[08:10.980 --> 08:12.100]  We are close.
[08:12.220 --> 08:13.240]  I think it said we had...
[08:13.240 --> 08:13.420]  Nope.
[08:13.600 --> 08:13.760]  We're good.
[08:13.880 --> 08:14.000]  That's enough.
[08:16.140 --> 08:16.760]  We did it.
[08:16.860 --> 08:17.380]  Of course, we want to go for more.
[08:18.120 --> 08:18.580]  Too late.
[08:18.960 --> 08:19.540]  We do not.
[08:19.980 --> 08:22.460]  We have to find a secondary spot in a minute anyway.
[08:22.580 --> 08:23.360]  So let's take a look at the map.
[08:23.500 --> 08:23.980]  Yeah, let's check.
[08:26.280 --> 08:28.800]  Looks like there's two items still in that room we were just in, though.
[08:30.600 --> 08:31.200]  Welcome back.
[08:31.480 --> 08:32.540]  Well, thank you very much, boys.
[08:32.660 --> 08:33.600]  Really do appreciate you.
[08:33.680 --> 08:36.520]  You know, you can use right click to rotate.
[08:38.800 --> 08:39.040]  Oh.
[08:39.980 --> 08:40.420]  Something to think about.
[08:40.420 --> 08:41.040]  That would have come in handy.
[08:41.340 --> 08:42.040]  Something to think about.
[08:42.280 --> 08:43.520]  But you did a great job.
[08:43.520 --> 08:46.680]  Thanks for bringing me back after I got fucking ass blasted.
[08:47.480 --> 08:50.620]  Does anyone have any extra health they could spare?
[08:52.340 --> 08:53.600]  I have one.
[08:54.180 --> 08:54.540]  Oh.
[08:56.840 --> 08:57.560]  Hold on.
[08:57.720 --> 08:58.320]  I'll give it to you.
[08:58.360 --> 08:59.280]  I broke a diamond.
[08:59.400 --> 09:00.060]  Okay, where are you?
[09:02.240 --> 09:02.920]  How much health do you have?
[09:02.980 --> 09:03.500]  I have 46.
[09:04.720 --> 09:05.540]  Just give me one.
[09:06.100 --> 09:06.460]  How do I do it?
[09:06.700 --> 09:07.200]  Like bit.
[09:07.520 --> 09:08.780]  You grab me by the back of the neck.
[09:09.500 --> 09:09.980]  That's it.
[09:10.180 --> 09:11.080]  I'm at 11.
[09:11.180 --> 09:11.660]  That'll be fine.
[09:11.660 --> 09:11.920]  Are you sure?
[09:12.040 --> 09:12.480]  Doesn't matter.
[09:13.520 --> 09:14.920]  Hey, I'd rather you have the health.
[09:14.960 --> 09:15.740]  How much do you have, Geoff?
[09:16.120 --> 09:16.720]  I have 40.
[09:16.800 --> 09:17.360]  I can give you some.
[09:17.800 --> 09:18.740]  Yeah, just give me one.
[09:18.820 --> 09:19.220]  How do I do it?
[09:19.220 --> 09:19.880]  Just right click on you?
[09:20.520 --> 09:21.000]  No, no, no.
[09:21.020 --> 09:21.320]  You hold.
[09:21.660 --> 09:22.860]  You grab me by the back of the neck.
[09:23.260 --> 09:23.680]  Okay, that's it.
[09:24.400 --> 09:24.880]  Thank you.
[09:24.920 --> 09:25.280]  Appreciate it.
[09:25.360 --> 09:27.660]  Yeah, the flame thing, it takes two of us to lift.
[09:27.800 --> 09:28.000]  Okay.
[09:28.040 --> 09:28.640]  You guys got it?
[09:28.800 --> 09:28.860]  Cool.
[09:29.320 --> 09:29.400]  Yeah.
[09:29.580 --> 09:29.820]  Ooh.
[09:30.520 --> 09:31.240]  Can we use it?
[09:32.120 --> 09:33.100]  I don't think so.
[09:34.520 --> 09:35.200]  Can you get that by yourself?
[09:35.260 --> 09:35.600]  I need help.
[09:37.000 --> 09:37.680]  All right, Gavin.
[09:37.720 --> 09:38.420]  You're right by the thing.
[09:38.480 --> 09:39.100]  You're moving the thing.
[09:43.040 --> 09:43.400]  Okay.
[09:43.480 --> 09:45.540]  I'm coming towards the cart.
[09:45.800 --> 09:46.260]  And I have four.
[09:46.340 --> 09:48.000]  I got $4,000 right here.
[09:48.320 --> 09:48.520]  Ooh.
[09:48.620 --> 09:48.800]  Ooh.
[09:48.800 --> 09:49.840]  Let me move this out of your way.
[09:50.100 --> 09:51.140]  They have $4,000 in their hands too.
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.660]  And then I have...
[09:54.340 --> 09:54.700]  Ooh.
[09:54.700 --> 09:55.980]  This place has some valuables.
[09:56.540 --> 09:57.480]  God, is this going to...
[09:57.480 --> 09:58.460]  Is everything going to fit?
[09:58.880 --> 09:59.420]  It'll be all right.
[09:59.840 --> 10:01.380]  We can always make multiple trips with a cart.
[10:02.400 --> 10:02.840]  Watch out.
[10:03.080 --> 10:03.260]  It's true.
[10:03.400 --> 10:04.160]  We got to go to a new spot anyway.
[10:04.160 --> 10:04.820]  Can we extract?
[10:05.300 --> 10:06.620]  Can we extract more than once?
[10:08.100 --> 10:08.460]  No.
[10:08.820 --> 10:10.400]  But we can just leave it in the room.
[10:10.400 --> 10:10.760]  Oh.
[10:10.880 --> 10:11.080]  Oh.
[10:11.200 --> 10:11.560]  Oh.
[10:11.640 --> 10:12.120]  We could...
[10:12.120 --> 10:14.920]  Yeah, we could leave it over there and then take stuff out.
[10:15.060 --> 10:15.480]  That's fine.
[10:15.840 --> 10:16.420]  Yeah, that's fine.
[10:18.860 --> 10:19.360]  All right.
[10:21.140 --> 10:21.920]  Well, off we go.
[10:24.640 --> 10:26.040]  Just watch out for the guy with the gun.
[10:26.500 --> 10:27.500]  He loves using it.
[10:27.800 --> 10:28.260]  It's his favorite.
[10:28.260 --> 10:29.340]  Good thing we're down...
[10:29.340 --> 10:29.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.680]  ...door behind us.
[10:30.820 --> 10:31.160]  Yeah, thank you.
[10:32.640 --> 10:33.000]  Oops.
[10:33.280 --> 10:34.100]  Okay, checking the map.
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.180]  Well, he's somewhere ahead of us.
[10:35.300 --> 10:35.700]  What is that?
[10:35.880 --> 10:36.480]  Guys, laptop.
[10:36.720 --> 10:37.500]  We walked right by it.
[10:37.980 --> 10:38.540]  Ooh, really?
[10:38.760 --> 10:39.180]  Grab it.
[10:39.180 --> 10:39.600]  Nice.
[10:40.720 --> 10:41.500]  I'm right behind you.
[10:41.640 --> 10:43.180]  That's a slightly damaged laptop.
[10:43.380 --> 10:44.040]  We walked right by it.
[10:45.020 --> 10:46.440]  Guys, guys, a pristine laptop.
[10:46.580 --> 10:47.800]  A slightly damaged laptop.
[10:48.220 --> 10:48.420]  Hold on.
[10:48.440 --> 10:48.500]  Hold on.
[10:48.500 --> 10:48.920]  We can fight him.
[10:49.300 --> 10:49.980]  Watch this, Gavin.
[10:51.620 --> 10:52.060]  Do it.
[10:52.080 --> 10:52.300]  Gavin.
[10:52.600 --> 10:52.900]  Do it.
[10:53.520 --> 10:54.120]  We can fight him.
[10:54.140 --> 10:55.200]  Just lift him up and throw them.
[10:56.440 --> 10:57.660]  No, they break our shit.
[10:57.800 --> 10:58.620]  They break our stuff.
[10:59.840 --> 11:00.200]  See?
[11:00.320 --> 11:00.900]  They can't be fought.
[11:01.160 --> 11:01.860]  They're destroying my laptop.
[11:02.420 --> 11:02.960]  Throw them.
[11:04.640 --> 11:05.460]  I smashed one.
[11:05.560 --> 11:05.680]  Yeah.
[11:06.140 --> 11:06.760]  Yeah, good job.
[11:06.840 --> 11:07.740]  Smash those little bastards.
[11:08.960 --> 11:10.100]  What the hell is that?
[11:10.240 --> 11:10.760]  A frog!
[11:12.220 --> 11:13.860]  Lift up the door and squash it.
[11:13.940 --> 11:14.520]  Oh, shit.
[11:14.620 --> 11:14.960]  It's massive.
[11:16.440 --> 11:17.100]  What do you mean?
[11:17.640 --> 11:19.200]  It's a giant fucking frog.
[11:19.900 --> 11:20.520]  Oh, I didn't see him.
[11:21.240 --> 11:21.840]  What's this?
[11:23.600 --> 11:24.960]  How did you not see the frog?
[11:25.720 --> 11:26.180]  I don't know.
[11:26.220 --> 11:26.700]  He didn't come in here.
[11:27.180 --> 11:27.800]  Did you see this?
[11:28.420 --> 11:30.060]  He didn't come in where we were with the frog?
[11:30.560 --> 11:30.760]  No.
[11:31.380 --> 11:31.840]  Oh, okay.
[11:31.900 --> 11:32.280]  That's why.
[11:32.740 --> 11:33.580]  Ah, he's got the gun.
[11:33.620 --> 11:34.220]  He's got the gun.
[11:34.300 --> 11:34.800]  He's got the gun.
[11:34.840 --> 11:35.440]  He's got the gun.
[11:35.440 --> 11:35.740]  Oh, shit.
[11:38.780 --> 11:41.420]  Wait, is the guy with the gun also a frog?
[11:42.360 --> 11:43.440]  No, two different guys.
[11:44.440 --> 11:45.760]  It's a frog with a gun.
[11:55.470 --> 11:55.970]  Oh!
[12:02.490 --> 12:03.630]  I didn't even...
[12:03.630 --> 12:05.710]  Garrett, I think...
[12:05.710 --> 12:08.030]  I was in the middle of typing when I got blown away.
[12:08.390 --> 12:08.990]  Me too.
[12:09.150 --> 12:09.830]  I typed something.
[12:10.470 --> 12:11.090]  You know what?
[12:11.270 --> 12:14.250]  I typed and entered, and as soon as I started talking,
[12:14.370 --> 12:16.370]  he went, oh, and turned and shot me.
[12:16.770 --> 12:17.610]  Just mean you.
[12:18.150 --> 12:19.430]  And then Eric screamed.
[12:19.930 --> 12:21.410]  Eric said, just mean you,
[12:21.490 --> 12:22.710]  and he turned around and blew his head off.
[12:24.230 --> 12:29.410]  I thought he was far enough away.
[12:29.710 --> 12:30.290]  Pretty exciting.
[12:30.690 --> 12:32.210]  Stop talking!
[12:33.230 --> 12:33.630]  No!
[12:37.910 --> 12:40.250]  He just leaves us all for dead.
[12:40.430 --> 12:43.350]  He just left us all for dead.
[12:44.090 --> 12:45.530]  Geoff just magooed his way out of there.
[12:45.990 --> 12:46.230]  Yep.
[12:48.330 --> 12:48.890]  Eric?
[12:49.330 --> 12:52.610]  Eric screamed, and then he spun and shot Gavin.
[12:55.030 --> 12:58.070]  Because I was killed, and then Eric went, ah!
[12:58.350 --> 13:00.290]  And then Gavin died a second later.
[13:08.210 --> 13:10.130]  Get under there, Geoff! Under the table!
[13:10.150 --> 13:12.990]  I love, I love that there's just no thought to hide.
[13:13.090 --> 13:13.830]  It's just run.
[13:14.970 --> 13:15.870]  Under the bed!
[13:17.230 --> 13:17.930]  There you go.
[13:22.910 --> 13:23.910]  It's not even running.
[13:23.990 --> 13:25.270]  It's just casual stroll.
[13:25.470 --> 13:25.810]  Oh, man.
[13:26.130 --> 13:26.870]  He's not even under it.
[13:27.250 --> 13:27.810]  He's barely under there.
[13:28.090 --> 13:28.770]  He's barely under there.
[13:28.770 --> 13:29.730]  I'm pretty fucked here.
[13:29.790 --> 13:30.810]  I got six health.
[13:31.410 --> 13:32.730]  Oh, God, he's right around the corner!
[13:33.490 --> 13:35.090]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[13:35.710 --> 13:37.150]  He's not hiding.
[13:37.290 --> 13:38.970]  He's not hiding at all.
[13:39.010 --> 13:40.230]  He's behind the chair!
[13:40.810 --> 13:41.270]  Chair!
[13:43.330 --> 13:44.530]  He's gonna say something, isn't he?
[13:44.770 --> 13:45.590]  This guy's blind.
[13:45.670 --> 13:46.290]  He only hears.
[13:46.890 --> 13:47.110]  Yep.
[13:47.590 --> 13:48.970]  It looks like he's waving at him.
[13:54.490 --> 13:57.650]  How did he get away with it?
[14:12.200 --> 14:13.680]  He's tucked in a chair.
[14:15.040 --> 14:16.080]  Oh, God.
[14:20.480 --> 14:22.580]  Boy, I'm all kinds of fucked here.
[14:22.880 --> 14:24.740]  Oh, no!
[14:25.200 --> 14:26.220]  He's still right there!
[14:26.480 --> 14:26.880]  Oh, God!
[14:26.980 --> 14:29.260]  Oh, God, he's in the bathroom!
[14:30.240 --> 14:30.880]  Get in the toilet!
[14:32.100 --> 14:34.420]  How did I get away from this fucking asshole?
[14:35.020 --> 14:37.000]  Stop walking around behind him!
[14:45.540 --> 14:47.220]  Did he go around to the left?
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.140]  Or is he in that room he's pointed at?
[14:50.720 --> 14:52.100]  He might be in that room.
[14:52.200 --> 14:54.820]  I don't see him back in the bed area.
[14:55.320 --> 14:57.200]  I can't believe he's still alive.
[14:57.320 --> 14:58.320]  I can't either.
[14:58.400 --> 14:59.500]  He got shot two times.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.480]  Let's figure out where to go.
[15:02.640 --> 15:04.000]  I was sat in silence on the shelf.
[15:04.140 --> 15:04.300]  No!
[15:06.840 --> 15:09.280]  How does he keep finding him?
[15:11.280 --> 15:12.780]  Why is he running?
[15:13.460 --> 15:14.500]  Why is he running?
[15:14.920 --> 15:15.940]  He hit Q.
[15:16.060 --> 15:17.180]  He's so insane.
[15:19.620 --> 15:20.420]  He's amazing!
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.260]  He's outsmarting the AI through confusing button presses.
[15:26.840 --> 15:27.780]  How did I go right to him?
[15:28.500 --> 15:29.780]  How could the AI know?
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.160]  He's going to walk right to him again.
[15:31.840 --> 15:34.780]  The AI can't know what he's going to do if he doesn't know what he's going to do.
[15:38.420 --> 15:40.200]  I can't believe he's alive again.
[15:40.520 --> 15:41.460]  Are there ten of them?
[15:41.800 --> 15:43.120]  Is that what we didn't realize?
[15:43.360 --> 15:44.540]  There's ten of them?
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.000]  There's one and you keep walking into him, you fucking moron.
[15:50.260 --> 15:53.140]  Imagine all kinds of shit going on over here.
[15:53.240 --> 15:55.440]  All kinds of shit to bring you guys back.
[15:55.520 --> 15:56.880]  Let me just figure out where to go.
[15:59.160 --> 16:01.940]  It probably doesn't help that I'm the dumbest of us.
[16:05.700 --> 16:06.400]  Here we go.
[16:07.140 --> 16:08.260]  Oh, he found the room.
[16:08.980 --> 16:10.000]  Go ahead and grab that.
[16:18.030 --> 16:19.550]  Hopefully you guys all saw that.
[16:20.570 --> 16:21.630]  I needed your heads.
[16:23.290 --> 16:24.150]  Disguise it, you idiot.
[16:24.150 --> 16:27.330]  How do we start a company with this fucking guy?
[16:27.610 --> 16:28.910]  Are you kidding me?
[16:29.250 --> 16:30.390]  Are you joking?
[16:31.690 --> 16:33.450]  Oh my god.
[16:35.850 --> 16:37.250]  Is this real?
[16:38.350 --> 16:39.770]  I feel like I'm being yelled at.
[16:40.190 --> 16:41.250]  I feel judged.
[16:41.870 --> 16:42.630]  I feel yelled at.
[16:43.010 --> 16:44.030]  Can I see your heads on this?
[16:45.390 --> 16:47.110]  Is that maybe back where you guys are?
[16:47.810 --> 16:48.850]  Oh my god.
[16:48.970 --> 16:50.130]  I'm not expecting anyone to get shot.
[16:50.130 --> 16:50.890]  I gotta go get that.
[16:51.650 --> 16:52.410]  No shit.
[16:52.510 --> 16:52.950]  Oh god.
[16:54.890 --> 16:58.250]  I feel like there's a whole narrative about how stupid I am.
[16:59.070 --> 17:00.630]  And how dumb I am.
[17:01.370 --> 17:03.310]  Not everybody thinks I'm dumb and stupid.
[17:03.690 --> 17:03.710]  No.
[17:03.990 --> 17:05.330]  Oh, I hate being stupid.
[17:05.490 --> 17:05.890]  This sucks.
[17:06.390 --> 17:07.670]  No, that's the cart. Where are our heads?
[17:07.770 --> 17:08.690]  I don't think we're in that.
[17:08.790 --> 17:09.130]  We're not.
[17:09.270 --> 17:10.230]  I'm in weak mode.
[17:10.730 --> 17:11.630]  I'm not just figures.
[17:12.170 --> 17:13.930]  It's like because I'm a bitch probably.
[17:20.190 --> 17:21.490]  Oh my god.
[17:21.490 --> 17:24.190]  He's just breaking shit and throwing it around.
[17:24.790 --> 17:26.250]  Doesn't have our heads.
[17:26.570 --> 17:27.630]  The gnomes.
[17:27.790 --> 17:29.610]  The gnomes killed the gnomes.
[17:29.690 --> 17:31.450]  The gnomes are all over him.
[17:31.470 --> 17:32.770]  They smashed the stuff.
[17:32.970 --> 17:33.700]  They smashed the...
[17:34.170 --> 17:36.070]  He has no idea they're there.
[17:36.550 --> 17:37.370]  He has no idea.
[17:37.430 --> 17:38.190]  They're breaking all the stuff.
[17:39.890 --> 17:41.590]  Oh no you don't.
[17:41.590 --> 17:43.870]  He's doing it.
[17:45.930 --> 17:46.870]  He's doing it.
[17:47.570 --> 17:47.930]  He's doing it.
[17:47.930 --> 17:49.290]  You motherfucking twit.
[17:50.570 --> 17:51.870]  Oh my god.
[17:53.550 --> 17:54.810]  Fight the flamethrower.
[17:55.530 --> 17:56.210]  This game is so good.
[17:56.210 --> 17:56.850]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[17:56.910 --> 17:57.570]  We're just gonna play it safe.
[17:57.570 --> 17:57.870]  Yeah.
[17:58.010 --> 17:58.950]  We're just gonna have to...
[17:58.950 --> 17:59.990]  He still doesn't have our heads.
[18:00.210 --> 18:01.450]  And he doesn't have enough money either.
[18:02.130 --> 18:03.010]  No, he's got nothing.
[18:03.110 --> 18:03.670]  Get this out of the way.
[18:04.330 --> 18:06.370]  He just keeps fucking bumping shit on the rocks.
[18:06.370 --> 18:07.810]  Oh, he's getting the noisy thing.
[18:07.870 --> 18:08.170]  No!
[18:09.050 --> 18:11.450]  I bet for a second you guys were like,
[18:11.530 --> 18:12.490]  Oh no, he did pretty good.
[18:12.530 --> 18:13.310]  He killed all the gnomes.
[18:13.350 --> 18:13.910]  That's not bad.
[18:14.230 --> 18:16.570]  But then you're back to yelling at me again about something.
[18:16.890 --> 18:17.390]  Like how we're laughing.
[18:18.730 --> 18:19.850]  Oh my god.
[18:20.570 --> 18:21.650]  Oh my god.
[18:21.930 --> 18:22.570]  I mean, I...
[18:23.850 --> 18:24.730]  I'm panicking.
[18:25.670 --> 18:26.690]  So much pressure.
[18:27.090 --> 18:28.270]  He's falling apart.
[18:29.050 --> 18:31.030]  Got all of your deaths to worry about.
[18:31.630 --> 18:34.110]  I'm just gonna bring this in.
[18:35.610 --> 18:37.310]  And then I'll have to go find all your heads.
[18:39.490 --> 18:42.030]  You're not gonna be able to carry all of them at once without that.
[18:42.310 --> 18:43.790]  Why wouldn't you put the heads in this?
[18:44.250 --> 18:44.510]  Yes.
[18:50.330 --> 18:51.210]  This is...
[18:51.210 --> 18:53.310]  This is a top 10 game ever made.
[18:53.410 --> 18:54.010]  This is incredible.
[18:54.550 --> 18:55.390]  This is unreal.
[18:55.390 --> 18:56.110]  Don't shut the door.
[18:57.530 --> 18:58.470]  Geoff, you're closing the door.
[18:58.970 --> 19:00.010]  I'm not trying to do that.
[19:00.750 --> 19:02.030]  I'm trying to get around it.
[19:03.450 --> 19:04.210]  There we go.
[19:06.790 --> 19:08.430]  He's closing all the doors.
[19:08.610 --> 19:11.170]  This is just unbelievable.
[19:14.450 --> 19:14.490]  Okay.
[19:16.090 --> 19:17.270]  Well, he's found his way back.
[19:17.330 --> 19:18.890]  It'd be funny if you guys weren't dead.
[19:19.390 --> 19:20.910]  You were just pretending this whole time.
[19:21.490 --> 19:21.990]  How much are we at?
[19:24.050 --> 19:25.370]  Oh, we're practically there.
[19:25.450 --> 19:25.710]  Okay.
[19:27.630 --> 19:28.110]  Why?
[19:28.670 --> 19:29.910]  Why is this the reason?
[19:33.010 --> 19:34.810]  How does he keep just...
[19:34.810 --> 19:36.870]  Why does he lay on the ground like that?
[19:37.050 --> 19:38.130]  Well, it works because he's alive.
[19:38.130 --> 19:38.550]  Oh my god!
[19:38.790 --> 19:39.450]  Oh no, the frog!
[19:39.930 --> 19:40.150]  The frog!
[19:40.230 --> 19:41.410]  Oh no, the frog!
[19:41.490 --> 19:42.410]  He doesn't know it's there!
[19:43.790 --> 19:44.890]  The frog missed!
[19:45.090 --> 19:46.330]  Well, the frog killed the guy!
[19:46.870 --> 19:48.370]  Oh, the frog got the guy down!
[19:48.970 --> 19:49.930]  What's going on?
[19:50.690 --> 19:51.450]  The frog's...
[19:51.450 --> 19:52.430]  Where'd the frog go?
[19:52.950 --> 19:53.370]  Oh, he's gone.
[19:53.530 --> 19:54.030]  I think he broke a door.
[19:54.690 --> 19:55.270]  Oh, he came back.
[19:55.270 --> 19:55.790]  Oh no, he's back.
[19:56.710 --> 19:57.570]  You've got to be kidding.
[19:58.770 --> 19:59.790]  He's whispering.
[20:00.190 --> 20:02.430]  So the frog and the guy hate each other.
[20:04.450 --> 20:05.990]  That is hilarious!
[20:05.990 --> 20:07.470]  There's so many kinds of fuck here.
[20:10.010 --> 20:14.050]  Oh, this game rules.
[20:18.230 --> 20:19.890]  How is he alive?
[20:20.570 --> 20:23.950]  This is the most amazing 15 minutes I've ever watched in my life.
[20:25.350 --> 20:26.270]  It's counted to like 10?
[20:26.730 --> 20:28.630]  He's magoo'd his way through this so hard.
[20:28.770 --> 20:29.390]  It's incredible.
[20:30.670 --> 20:32.430]  I'm amazed at how...
[20:32.430 --> 20:35.530]  He walks up to them without realizing there's a guy in that room.
[20:37.950 --> 20:38.390]  One...
[20:40.510 --> 20:40.950]  Two...
[20:40.950 --> 20:41.230]  What?
[20:42.390 --> 20:42.830]  Three?
[20:42.990 --> 20:45.090]  Is he trying to psych himself up?
[20:45.230 --> 20:45.770]  What's he doing?
[20:45.870 --> 20:47.290]  I think he's trying to count to 10 before he moves.
[20:47.370 --> 20:47.570]  Four?
[20:48.710 --> 20:50.690]  Every number has a question mark after it.
[20:53.190 --> 20:58.590]  Oh, this is...
[20:58.590 --> 20:59.850]  The frog's there, son.
[21:01.150 --> 21:02.170]  He saw it that time.
[21:04.210 --> 21:05.590]  This is better than modern cinema.
[21:06.630 --> 21:08.310]  And the guy, he's walking towards him.
[21:08.350 --> 21:09.070]  And the gnomes.
[21:09.130 --> 21:09.750]  Oh my god.
[21:10.290 --> 21:10.390]  Oh!
[21:12.450 --> 21:13.670]  The gnome will fuck him up.
[21:13.750 --> 21:14.150]  Jabba!
[21:16.330 --> 21:17.750]  Come on, man!
[21:18.490 --> 21:18.930]  Dude!
[21:19.670 --> 21:21.330]  I don't know how you survived that.
[21:21.410 --> 21:21.870]  It was incredible.
[21:22.670 --> 21:25.130]  You lived so long and it was a gnome that killed you.
[21:26.250 --> 21:29.790]  Dude, they threw every fucking enemy in the game and they all punched.
[21:30.690 --> 21:32.950]  You could not stop walking into that, that was amazing.
[21:33.690 --> 21:35.150]  Alright, now we fight to the death.
[21:36.130 --> 21:38.370]  I'm so sorry, I tried so hard to get you guys.
[21:39.650 --> 21:40.570]  It was great.
[21:50.490 --> 21:51.590]  What happened to my...
[21:51.590 --> 21:52.250]  No!
[21:58.560 --> 21:58.960]  Stay.
[21:59.220 --> 21:59.480]  No!
[22:00.720 --> 22:01.840]  How are you supposed to...
[22:01.840 --> 22:04.620]  How are you supposed to stay on that?
[22:06.380 --> 22:07.180]  I don't know.
[22:07.320 --> 22:08.240]  Oh my god.
[22:08.360 --> 22:10.480]  Maybe you're supposed to break the thing open and get the crown.
[22:11.800 --> 22:12.240]  Probably.
[22:13.000 --> 22:13.800]  That's probably it.
[22:14.460 --> 22:17.320]  Was I right that you guys were criticizing everything I was doing?
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.020]  100% on the money.
[22:20.400 --> 22:21.240]  Okay, thank you.
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.360]  Not everything.
[22:24.780 --> 22:27.120]  How are there so many of this guy with the gun?
[22:27.280 --> 22:29.060]  As you walk in right behind him.
[22:29.220 --> 22:29.900]  Like, unreal.
[22:30.380 --> 22:33.420]  You were like, intentionally following that guy.
[22:33.700 --> 22:35.520]  It was, you just kept following him.
[22:35.720 --> 22:37.100]  You just kept following him.
[22:37.380 --> 22:38.880]  He was going the way I had to go.
[22:41.080 --> 22:42.560]  Woah! Okay, there it is.
[22:42.860 --> 22:43.420]  Extraction point.
[22:43.880 --> 22:45.420]  Okay, this should be an easy one.
[22:45.780 --> 22:46.660]  We're back to level 1.
[22:47.360 --> 22:48.240]  8500 bucks.
[22:48.820 --> 22:50.080]  Yeah, our health and stuff are down.
[22:50.580 --> 22:50.820]  Yep.
[22:51.580 --> 22:52.440]  My health is 101.
[22:52.840 --> 22:54.140]  Oh yeah, thank you.
[22:54.520 --> 22:54.960]  Sorry.
[22:56.260 --> 22:57.400]  What is this, like a Breville?
[22:57.540 --> 22:59.080]  What is this, like a George Foreman?
[22:59.080 --> 22:59.720]  Hey boys.
[22:59.740 --> 23:01.200]  Oh, got the chainsaw.
[23:02.100 --> 23:02.980]  Oh, broken.
[23:03.680 --> 23:03.940]  Yep.
[23:07.220 --> 23:07.660]  Nice.
[23:08.080 --> 23:11.040]  I wonder if you can use that to open up locked cabinets and shit.
[23:11.180 --> 23:12.160]  When they have like...
[23:12.160 --> 23:12.880]  Ooh, interesting.
[23:13.460 --> 23:15.720]  I bet you can fight the frog with it.
[23:15.720 --> 23:17.520]  Stop knocking me over!
[23:18.060 --> 23:18.800]  Let's check the fridge.
[23:19.500 --> 23:19.940]  Goddammit.
[23:23.020 --> 23:23.460]  Extra.
[23:23.720 --> 23:24.580]  Ooh, Eric.
[23:25.000 --> 23:25.400]  Oh, here you go.
[23:25.720 --> 23:26.800]  The Noon Blade.
[23:27.000 --> 23:27.140]  Oh!
[23:27.140 --> 23:28.020]  Way to go, buddy!
[23:28.020 --> 23:28.360]  Yes, maybe.
[23:28.600 --> 23:29.640]  Something terrible happened.
[23:29.680 --> 23:32.520]  I feel like two of us are grabbing it at the same time, I think.
[23:32.700 --> 23:32.920]  Nope!
[23:33.080 --> 23:34.120]  I watched you grab it.
[23:34.180 --> 23:34.920]  I didn't touch it.
[23:35.120 --> 23:35.500]  Interesting.
[23:35.880 --> 23:36.680]  And I fucked up.
[23:39.040 --> 23:39.840]  That's all I'm saying.
[23:41.060 --> 23:41.840]  That's all he's saying.
[23:42.660 --> 23:43.160]  I heard him.
[23:44.120 --> 23:44.720]  Right there?
[23:45.180 --> 23:45.980]  Oh, a diamond.
[23:46.220 --> 23:47.100]  Ooh, you had an ocarina.
[23:48.640 --> 23:50.440]  I got a frog, or something.
[23:51.700 --> 23:52.440]  What is this?
[23:53.160 --> 23:54.780]  Sounds like it's making noise in here.
[23:54.960 --> 23:55.280]  Yeah.
[23:55.280 --> 23:56.500]  Is that Mark the Frog?
[23:57.400 --> 23:59.280]  Oh, dude, you got Mark the Frog in this game?
[23:59.480 --> 24:00.340]  They got everything.
[24:01.980 --> 24:02.540]  What's in here?
[24:02.620 --> 24:03.500]  Oh, I heard a boom.
[24:03.620 --> 24:03.880]  That's me.
[24:04.020 --> 24:04.540]  I opened the door.
[24:06.640 --> 24:07.180]  Oh, I see.
[24:07.240 --> 24:07.600]  It's the door.
[24:07.940 --> 24:08.660]  Ooh, what's this?
[24:09.380 --> 24:10.020]  Did you guys hear that?
[24:13.340 --> 24:14.040]  Ooh, what is that?
[24:14.280 --> 24:14.860]  I don't know!
[24:15.160 --> 24:16.720]  Oh, it's like a thing of gems.
[24:19.380 --> 24:20.020]  Truly outrageous!
[24:21.780 --> 24:22.980]  You're in the gem!
[24:28.280 --> 24:29.700]  I don't like that all these doors are open.
[24:30.780 --> 24:31.880]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[24:32.520 --> 24:33.920]  Something had to open them.
[24:35.280 --> 24:36.220]  Is this where we came in?
[24:37.000 --> 24:37.220]  Yeah.
[24:37.860 --> 24:40.160]  Nick, are you by the trolley thing?
[24:41.040 --> 24:41.460]  Yeah.
[24:42.340 --> 24:42.840]  Oh!
[24:43.140 --> 24:44.020]  Oh, I heard that!
[24:44.280 --> 24:44.720]  Oh!
[24:44.980 --> 24:45.340]  Guys!
[24:45.760 --> 24:46.220]  Guys!
[24:46.860 --> 24:47.360]  Guys!
[24:47.640 --> 24:47.980]  Guys!
[24:48.380 --> 24:48.740]  Guys!
[24:49.000 --> 24:49.920]  I'm all pukey!
[24:50.540 --> 24:51.860]  You gotta find a way...
[24:51.860 --> 24:52.760]  Get away from me!
[24:52.960 --> 24:54.280]  Get away from me!
[24:54.460 --> 24:55.140]  Help me!
[24:55.320 --> 24:56.380]  You have to find...
[24:56.380 --> 24:57.740]  You have to find...
[24:57.740 --> 25:00.060]  You have to find something to, like, get it out of you.
[25:00.700 --> 25:02.000]  Where's the chainsaw?
[25:02.140 --> 25:02.960]  Bring the chainsaw!
[25:03.360 --> 25:03.940]  Give me the chainsaw!
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.320]  The chainsaw's gonna kill you!
[25:05.900 --> 25:06.460]  Kill me!
[25:06.740 --> 25:07.020]  No!
[25:07.680 --> 25:08.480]  We need...
[25:08.480 --> 25:08.940]  Free me!
[25:09.600 --> 25:10.060]  Free me!
[25:10.200 --> 25:10.860]  We need to find...
[25:10.860 --> 25:11.280]  Oh, God!
[25:12.340 --> 25:13.180]  Free me!
[25:13.340 --> 25:13.740]  Oh, no!
[25:14.400 --> 25:16.240]  Nick threw up all over me on purpose!
[25:17.020 --> 25:17.340]  No!
[25:17.640 --> 25:18.080]  Free me!
[25:18.380 --> 25:18.940]  Yeah, there's a...
[25:20.980 --> 25:21.420]  Nick!
[25:21.640 --> 25:22.620]  Nick, throw up on it!
[25:22.700 --> 25:23.780]  Nick, throw up on it!
[25:24.260 --> 25:25.680]  Okay, I'm going for it!
[25:32.080 --> 25:32.880]  Help me, son!
[25:33.040 --> 25:33.180]  Gavin!
[25:33.560 --> 25:34.880]  Oh, my God, no!
[25:35.220 --> 25:36.220]  Gavin, die!
[25:37.920 --> 25:39.220]  I killed her with...
[25:39.220 --> 25:39.320]  Ah!
[25:39.640 --> 25:39.880]  Ah!
[26:01.730 --> 26:02.350]  Uh-oh.
[26:03.010 --> 26:03.690]  Sees him again.
[26:06.070 --> 26:07.390]  Gavin, you're a true hero.
[26:10.610 --> 26:11.370]  Am I...
[26:11.370 --> 26:11.730]  Guys?
[26:11.890 --> 26:12.070]  Hello?
[26:13.690 --> 26:15.150]  I'm not the only one left, am I?
[26:15.990 --> 26:17.570]  I feel like...
[26:17.570 --> 26:18.250]  Eric survived?
[26:18.350 --> 26:18.970]  I hear Geoff.
[26:19.130 --> 26:19.410]  Geoff?
[26:20.850 --> 26:21.350]  Geoff?
[26:22.690 --> 26:23.830]  Hey, what's up?
[26:24.750 --> 26:25.530]  Gavin's dead.
[26:28.190 --> 26:29.030]  Where's Gavin?
[26:29.570 --> 26:30.510]  His head's in there.
[26:31.030 --> 26:31.110]  Oh, fuck.
[26:31.430 --> 26:32.750]  Yeah, come over here with me.
[26:32.930 --> 26:33.330]  Ah!
[26:33.450 --> 26:34.850]  The puke thing's coming back!
[26:40.960 --> 26:42.680]  He never fully goes under.
[26:44.980 --> 26:46.580]  He almost hides.
[26:48.980 --> 26:51.100]  That animation looks so funny.
[26:51.940 --> 26:52.760]  Did the puke thing come?
[26:53.420 --> 26:54.060]  No, it didn't.
[26:54.060 --> 26:54.520]  It flew by.
[26:54.880 --> 26:55.420]  Oh, OK.
[26:55.560 --> 26:55.980]  Oh, it's in here.
[26:56.420 --> 26:58.400]  How did you get it off you?
[26:59.020 --> 27:00.700]  I think she hit me enough to get it off me.
[27:01.020 --> 27:01.420]  Oh, OK.
[27:02.180 --> 27:02.760]  Oh, God.
[27:02.820 --> 27:03.340]  It's coming back.
[27:05.680 --> 27:06.440]  Eric, look out.
[27:06.840 --> 27:07.200]  Oh!
[27:07.260 --> 27:07.920]  Yeah, I see it.
[27:15.310 --> 27:16.610]  Gavin's screams were terrible.
[27:17.990 --> 27:18.830]  Is Gavin dead?
[27:18.990 --> 27:19.590]  Yeah, he's in the cart.
[27:20.610 --> 27:20.870]  Oh.
[27:22.370 --> 27:23.350]  There's stuff back here.
[27:23.430 --> 27:23.590]  OK.
[27:24.190 --> 27:25.650]  Let's get it for money purposes.
[27:26.130 --> 27:26.610]  We'll bring Gavin back.
[27:26.610 --> 27:27.730]  Is the cart going with us?
[27:27.850 --> 27:28.870]  Or are we taking it to the store?
[27:28.870 --> 27:29.950]  No, they're taking the shit!
[27:30.750 --> 27:31.550]  Get out of there!
[27:31.730 --> 27:32.490]  Oh, it's a Reaper!
[27:32.710 --> 27:32.850]  Ah!
[27:33.830 --> 27:34.370]  Oh, no!
[27:34.430 --> 27:34.990]  What's that mean?
[27:35.850 --> 27:37.230]  I don't know, but it killed Gavin.
[27:38.950 --> 27:39.810]  I fear it.
[27:41.270 --> 27:41.430]  Ah!
[27:44.310 --> 27:45.390]  I think Geoff did, man.
[27:47.330 --> 27:47.690]  OK.
[27:49.310 --> 27:50.470]  I didn't do anything.
[27:51.770 --> 27:52.130]  Geoff.
[27:52.810 --> 27:53.170]  Ooh.
[27:55.150 --> 27:55.550]  What was that?
[27:56.610 --> 27:57.790]  Are you alive?
[28:02.240 --> 28:02.720]  Eric?
[28:03.740 --> 28:04.220]  Eric?
[28:07.940 --> 28:08.280]  Eric?
[28:10.080 --> 28:10.980]  I don't think...
[28:10.980 --> 28:13.920]  I think Eric hid himself in...
[28:13.920 --> 28:14.740]  Oh, he's actually alive.
[28:14.920 --> 28:15.360]  Oh, I hear him.
[28:15.480 --> 28:16.180]  He's in another room.
[28:17.580 --> 28:18.240]  It's coming.
[28:18.520 --> 28:18.900]  Coming back.
[28:19.640 --> 28:20.200]  Got it.
[28:20.500 --> 28:21.400]  I'm leading the way.
[28:34.860 --> 28:36.240]  Did he choke on a drink?
[28:36.800 --> 28:38.300]  Oh, I swallowed my cough drop.
[28:38.300 --> 28:38.680]  Fuck.
[28:42.490 --> 28:43.290]  You gotta...
[28:43.290 --> 28:46.330]  We gotta put more stuff in that thing and then go back to the extraction where we started.
[28:47.970 --> 28:48.910]  There you go.
[28:48.970 --> 28:49.170]  Nope.
[28:49.770 --> 28:49.990]  Yep.
[28:50.330 --> 28:50.490]  Yeah.
[28:50.910 --> 28:51.190]  Got it.
[28:52.370 --> 28:52.890]  Alright, I'm alive.
[28:53.230 --> 28:53.430]  OK.
[28:53.590 --> 28:54.250]  You wanna grab something?
[28:55.010 --> 28:55.210]  Yeah.
[28:55.590 --> 28:56.290]  There's a bonsai tree.
[28:56.650 --> 28:56.910]  Cool.
[28:58.590 --> 28:59.430]  Oh, there's a monkey.
[28:59.970 --> 29:00.310]  Yeah.
[29:02.090 --> 29:02.890]  I think...
[29:02.890 --> 29:03.830]  What are we at?
[29:03.830 --> 29:04.490]  I think we got enough.
[29:04.870 --> 29:05.070]  Do we?
[29:05.110 --> 29:05.390]  Oh, yeah.
[29:05.490 --> 29:05.870]  12?
[29:06.130 --> 29:06.270]  OK.
[29:06.950 --> 29:10.810]  Let's put these in the cart and then we'll get it going.
[29:11.110 --> 29:12.070]  What's the best way to go?
[29:12.250 --> 29:12.450]  Here we go.
[29:12.650 --> 29:13.030]  Oh, that way.
[29:13.130 --> 29:13.230]  OK.
[29:13.350 --> 29:13.870]  Oh, 16.
[29:14.030 --> 29:14.310]  Hell yeah.
[29:14.430 --> 29:15.490]  Alright, Nick, you wanna take it?
[29:15.870 --> 29:16.390]  Yeah, I got it.
[29:16.410 --> 29:16.650]  Let's go.
[29:17.770 --> 29:18.830]  She's somewhere over here.
[29:19.170 --> 29:20.330]  OK, I'm gonna keep an eye out this way.
[29:21.670 --> 29:22.610]  Gavin, we're coming back.
[29:22.870 --> 29:23.530]  I'm gonna watch...
[29:23.530 --> 29:26.750]  I'm gonna physically watch your back, Nick, so if you die, I see it happen.
[29:26.930 --> 29:27.050]  Excellent.
[29:27.190 --> 29:28.630]  And then I'll be able to...
[29:28.630 --> 29:29.550]  Drop my head in the cart?
[29:29.710 --> 29:30.530]  Provide a statement.
[29:30.910 --> 29:31.250]  Oh, yeah.
[29:31.310 --> 29:32.190]  And your head, too.
[29:32.890 --> 29:33.710]  Alright, here we go.
[29:35.290 --> 29:36.010]  Back away.
[29:36.230 --> 29:36.650]  Yep.
[29:37.390 --> 29:37.770]  Eric?
[29:38.030 --> 29:38.230]  We always say.
[29:39.170 --> 29:39.730]  Yeah, I'm good.
[29:39.850 --> 29:40.030]  OK.
[29:40.290 --> 29:40.830]  He's good.
[29:41.430 --> 29:43.150]  Just making sure, because Gavin's coming back.
[29:44.230 --> 29:44.550]  All good.
[29:48.430 --> 29:48.850]  Nice.
[29:53.470 --> 29:53.890]  Hey!
[29:54.710 --> 29:54.990]  I got...
[29:54.990 --> 29:55.510]  I got hacked up.
[29:56.050 --> 29:57.130]  Yeah, you really did.
[29:57.290 --> 29:58.470]  I tried to vomit on her for you.
[29:59.790 --> 30:04.410]  When she came back in, it sounded like you swallowed your tongue.
[30:06.110 --> 30:07.390]  Dude, I did.
[30:07.550 --> 30:09.590]  I inhaled this cough drop that I had.
[30:10.390 --> 30:10.830]  OK.
[30:11.210 --> 30:12.970]  Do we want to end this level, then?
[30:13.010 --> 30:13.530]  Is that the plan?
[30:14.490 --> 30:14.650]  Yeah.
[30:14.830 --> 30:15.050]  Yes.
[30:15.270 --> 30:15.470]  Yeah.
[30:15.550 --> 30:15.790]  OK.
[30:16.590 --> 30:16.870]  Nice.
[30:17.190 --> 30:17.470]  What a success.
[30:18.130 --> 30:18.550]  Way to go, boys.
[30:19.270 --> 30:19.970]  Hit up the next one.
[30:20.250 --> 30:20.390]  Yep.
[30:22.870 --> 30:23.310]  Nice.
[30:24.250 --> 30:25.110]  Good work, boys.
[30:25.270 --> 30:25.970]  That one's a...
[30:25.970 --> 30:26.970]  That's a scary enemy.
[30:27.570 --> 30:27.730]  Yep.
[30:28.010 --> 30:29.570]  I had not experienced that one before.
[30:29.950 --> 30:31.250]  Little hacking woman clown?
[30:31.470 --> 30:31.690]  No.
[30:34.410 --> 30:35.370]  That was a new one.
[30:35.770 --> 30:36.530]  Whatever that was.
[30:36.870 --> 30:37.970]  You didn't see it?
[30:38.350 --> 30:39.170]  No, I don't think so.
[30:39.970 --> 30:40.370]  Holy...
[30:40.370 --> 30:41.590]  I saw the Reaper thing.
[30:41.770 --> 30:42.490]  Is that what it was?
[30:43.450 --> 30:44.550]  The thing you called a Reaper?
[30:44.930 --> 30:45.150]  Yeah.
[30:45.350 --> 30:46.090]  Yeah, she was a Reaper.
[30:46.390 --> 30:47.590]  I'm grabbing a stamina upgrade.
[30:47.690 --> 30:48.350]  This one's mine.
[30:48.550 --> 30:49.610]  This is my stamina upgrade.
[30:49.610 --> 30:50.110]  I'm getting home as well.
[30:50.290 --> 30:51.530]  I'm gonna grab a...
[30:52.330 --> 30:53.390]  I just put a health for me.
[30:53.470 --> 30:54.250]  Health upgrade.
[30:54.610 --> 30:55.550]  This one's mine.
[30:55.590 --> 30:55.810]  OK.
[30:55.930 --> 30:57.570]  I'm grabbing a health upgrade.
[30:58.410 --> 30:59.170]  It's for me.
[30:59.410 --> 31:01.030]  Gavin, after you use it, remind me and I'll heal you.
[31:01.270 --> 31:02.470]  I have 85 health.
[31:02.470 --> 31:04.730]  Where did my health upgrade just go?
[31:05.030 --> 31:06.150]  You just threw it behind you.
[31:07.350 --> 31:09.750]  You probably just want to set it down gently.
[31:11.030 --> 31:11.390]  Boy.
[31:14.230 --> 31:14.890]  There you go.
[31:15.450 --> 31:16.670]  I'm fucking strong.
[31:17.690 --> 31:18.050]  OK.
[31:18.170 --> 31:18.870]  Are we good?
[31:18.930 --> 31:19.310]  Anyone else?
[31:19.390 --> 31:19.590]  Anything?
[31:19.830 --> 31:19.990]  We good?
[31:20.010 --> 31:22.830]  Oh, here's one of those dilithium crystals we can pour into the truck.
[31:23.190 --> 31:23.990]  Is that what we...
[31:23.990 --> 31:24.970]  Should we do it?
[31:24.990 --> 31:25.190]  How much?
[31:25.270 --> 31:25.770]  Oh, it's 7k.
[31:25.770 --> 31:26.450]  We can't afford it.
[31:28.890 --> 31:29.110]  Yeah.
[31:29.510 --> 31:30.710]  We should find out what it is with Andrew.
[31:30.850 --> 31:31.990]  Let's do it on the next run.
[31:31.990 --> 31:32.550]  All right, here we go.
[31:32.570 --> 31:32.970]  You guys ready?
[31:43.350 --> 31:44.290]  Back to the truck.
[31:45.110 --> 31:46.930]  There's a little thing called an extraction tracker.
[31:47.010 --> 31:47.430]  That's cool.
[31:47.710 --> 31:47.950]  Yeah.
[31:48.390 --> 31:49.070]  All right, you guys ready?
[31:49.810 --> 31:50.030]  Yeah.
[31:53.410 --> 31:57.390]  Do you think the crystal maybe takes us to like further levels or something?
[32:01.610 --> 32:03.250]  Like an alien planet?
[32:03.850 --> 32:04.130]  Yeah.
[32:04.750 --> 32:05.190]  OK.
[32:05.190 --> 32:06.650]  I got the stamina upgrade.
[32:06.850 --> 32:07.610]  That's for daddy.
[32:07.990 --> 32:08.810]  51 health.
[32:09.430 --> 32:09.890]  Nice.
[32:10.270 --> 32:12.150]  Yeah, the crystal powers up.
[32:12.490 --> 32:12.950]  You have 51 health.
[32:12.950 --> 32:13.190]  All right, stay still.
[32:13.730 --> 32:14.090]  Stay still.
[32:14.530 --> 32:15.090]  You keep moving.
[32:16.330 --> 32:17.310]  Oh, my God.
[32:19.110 --> 32:19.730]  Thank you.
[32:19.850 --> 32:20.570]  What do you got now, Geoff?
[32:21.290 --> 32:21.750]  61.
[32:22.450 --> 32:23.970]  Here, let me give you some.
[32:24.290 --> 32:24.470]  Turn around.
[32:28.230 --> 32:28.970]  Oh, thanks.
[32:28.970 --> 32:29.270]  There you go.
[32:30.170 --> 32:30.370]  Cool.
[32:30.790 --> 32:31.090]  All right.
[32:32.150 --> 32:32.830]  Where's Nick?
[32:33.590 --> 32:34.530]  Oh, wait, no.
[32:34.870 --> 32:35.530]  Wait, where's Nick?
[32:35.930 --> 32:36.250]  Nick?
[32:36.810 --> 32:37.210]  Nick?
[32:38.350 --> 32:38.650]  Nick?
[32:38.670 --> 32:39.450]  Did you leave him at the shop?
[32:40.950 --> 32:41.790]  He's not in the game.
[32:42.250 --> 32:43.110]  He's not in the game.
[32:43.950 --> 32:45.210]  Oh, internet died.
[32:45.910 --> 32:48.090]  Well, thanks for watching this video.
[32:55.670 --> 32:58.570]  All right, boys, we're back at Swift Broom Academy.
[32:58.810 --> 33:00.470]  Welcome to Swift Broom Academy.
[33:00.610 --> 33:02.350]  Grab your upgrades one more time.
[33:02.490 --> 33:03.230]  This one's for daddy.
[33:03.790 --> 33:04.610]  And now we're in business.
[33:05.210 --> 33:07.830]  Let us know in the comments what we're supposed to do with this.
[33:09.930 --> 33:10.570]  Oh, yeah.
[33:10.590 --> 33:12.150]  We put crystals in it.
[33:12.370 --> 33:13.270]  Yeah, we put crystals in it.
[33:13.410 --> 33:14.430]  Are you still lame on health?
[33:14.530 --> 33:15.070]  Let me give you health.
[33:15.090 --> 33:15.610]  I got 51.
[33:17.170 --> 33:18.190]  Oh, yeah, here.
[33:18.350 --> 33:18.750]  I can give you some.
[33:19.870 --> 33:20.830]  Nick, how you doing on health?
[33:21.410 --> 33:21.910]  Let's take a look at the map.
[33:21.950 --> 33:22.590]  I've got 45.
[33:22.690 --> 33:22.910]  I'm good.
[33:23.230 --> 33:23.650]  All right.
[33:24.310 --> 33:25.310]  Yeah, present to me.
[33:25.430 --> 33:25.610]  Good.
[33:25.690 --> 33:26.010]  Thank you.
[33:26.710 --> 33:27.450]  Ooh, present.
[33:28.150 --> 33:28.850]  All right, let's take a look.
[33:29.910 --> 33:31.490]  All right, watch out for shotgun-wielding lunatics.
[33:31.810 --> 33:32.330]  Ooh, a book.
[33:32.330 --> 33:39.010]  I think this one's less shotgun-wielding lunatics and more scary night guys, right?
[33:39.030 --> 33:41.130]  Yes, but I have run into him here before.
[33:41.490 --> 33:41.830]  Oh, okay.
[33:41.910 --> 33:43.510]  Can you go down the middle a bit?
[33:46.430 --> 33:47.390]  That's scary down there.
[33:47.490 --> 33:48.950]  Yeah, that might be the end of us.
[33:50.110 --> 33:50.850]  How we looking in there?
[33:50.930 --> 33:51.730]  Oh, ho, ho.
[33:52.970 --> 33:54.230]  Look at Geoff.
[33:54.550 --> 33:55.650]  What does it look like down there?
[33:55.670 --> 33:56.030]  Bang.
[33:56.090 --> 33:57.210]  Way to go, buddy.
[33:57.650 --> 33:58.210]  Thank you.
[33:58.510 --> 33:59.110]  Not done yet.
[34:00.170 --> 34:00.590]  Here we go.
[34:01.090 --> 34:01.330]  Ooh.
[34:01.330 --> 34:03.310]  That's a small room.
[34:04.210 --> 34:04.550]  The crown.
[34:05.310 --> 34:06.010]  You got it?
[34:06.350 --> 34:07.150]  Yeah, I got the crown.
[34:07.250 --> 34:07.870]  I'll get whatever you...
[34:07.870 --> 34:08.190]  There you go.
[34:08.350 --> 34:09.450]  Oh, shit, guys.
[34:09.710 --> 34:10.190]  Look at that.
[34:10.270 --> 34:10.550]  You go...
[34:10.550 --> 34:11.130]  Oh, no, I fell.
[34:12.650 --> 34:13.370]  Oh, Geoff.
[34:13.570 --> 34:14.150]  Did he jump down?
[34:14.830 --> 34:14.950]  You know?
[34:14.950 --> 34:15.410]  You know?
[34:15.650 --> 34:18.330]  When somebody yells, oh, shit, in this game...
[34:19.150 --> 34:19.510]  What?
[34:19.530 --> 34:20.090]  What is this?
[34:20.150 --> 34:20.850]  They probably shouldn't do that.
[34:21.390 --> 34:21.970]  Was he bouncing?
[34:22.250 --> 34:23.170]  No, he could catch his head.
[34:24.810 --> 34:25.070]  Oh.
[34:27.030 --> 34:27.870]  Did it fly out?
[34:28.470 --> 34:29.210]  How do we get it?
[34:29.210 --> 34:30.270]  I don't know.
[34:30.750 --> 34:31.310]  Is it still bouncing?
[34:31.310 --> 34:32.050]  I don't see it.
[34:32.130 --> 34:33.290]  I'm going to try and grab it.
[34:33.890 --> 34:35.130]  I'm also trying.
[34:35.370 --> 34:36.510]  Oh, you almost had it.
[34:36.970 --> 34:37.490]  Give it.
[34:37.730 --> 34:37.910]  Give it.
[34:37.990 --> 34:38.150]  Give it.
[34:38.650 --> 34:39.370]  Oh, shit.
[34:41.070 --> 34:42.390]  Oh, come on, Geoff.
[34:42.830 --> 34:44.010]  Oh, so close.
[34:44.070 --> 34:44.310]  Come to me.
[34:45.430 --> 34:46.670]  It's hard to see up there.
[34:47.610 --> 34:48.130]  Oh, I got it.
[34:48.130 --> 34:48.590]  You got it.
[34:48.750 --> 34:49.310]  You got it.
[34:49.610 --> 34:50.190]  Oh, my God.
[34:50.730 --> 34:51.030]  Okay.
[34:51.250 --> 34:51.610]  Wow.
[34:52.270 --> 34:52.910]  Throw it in.
[34:53.190 --> 34:53.890]  We have...
[34:53.890 --> 34:57.670]  We almost have enough to revive him if we want to do that and then make our next...
[34:57.670 --> 34:59.490]  Throw it in the car or back in the hall?
[34:59.490 --> 35:00.130]  In the car.
[35:01.910 --> 35:02.530]  Hey, Gavin.
[35:02.690 --> 35:03.070]  Hey, Gavin.
[35:03.210 --> 35:03.750]  Back in the hall.
[35:04.450 --> 35:05.430]  No, don't do it, Gavin.
[35:05.490 --> 35:06.370]  I don't want to get his head.
[35:06.950 --> 35:08.610]  It looked like such a pain in the ass to get.
[35:08.910 --> 35:09.810]  That was pretty hard.
[35:10.150 --> 35:11.010]  Oh, a big vase.
[35:12.130 --> 35:12.490]  What?
[35:14.170 --> 35:14.610]  I'm big.
[35:15.270 --> 35:15.870]  Yeah, I'm coming.
[35:17.110 --> 35:17.850]  I'm on my way.
[35:19.210 --> 35:19.750]  Oh, here we go.
[35:21.090 --> 35:22.090]  Oh, there's a big vase.
[35:22.630 --> 35:24.290]  I got a $900 frog, boys.
[35:26.170 --> 35:26.530]  Nice.
[35:27.230 --> 35:28.410]  We're in the money.
[35:29.090 --> 35:31.650]  I'm going to move the cart back near the extraction point.
[35:32.010 --> 35:33.610]  Okay, we're coming your way.
[35:34.690 --> 35:37.370]  Do you have something to put in or are you just going to put it on the...
[35:37.530 --> 35:38.470]  Oh, is it going to go in?
[35:38.630 --> 35:39.830]  Do you want it in the...
[35:39.830 --> 35:42.630]  Oh, shit, the eye.
[35:42.870 --> 35:43.310]  Run, Eric.
[35:44.750 --> 35:45.570]  Nick, get the vase.
[35:45.650 --> 35:46.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:46.950 --> 35:47.350]  That's it.
[35:47.530 --> 35:47.690]  Okay.
[35:47.990 --> 35:49.230]  Oh, it's too big.
[35:49.290 --> 35:50.150]  Oh, it's okay.
[35:50.750 --> 35:51.090]  Oh.
[35:53.090 --> 35:53.690]  Am I still...
[35:53.690 --> 35:55.050]  Where did that eye come from, bro?
[35:55.310 --> 35:56.790]  No, you sound like you.
[35:57.410 --> 35:58.010]  I'm normal?
[35:58.010 --> 35:58.570]  Okay, cool.
[35:58.690 --> 35:59.830]  All right, pull it in, boys.
[35:59.870 --> 36:00.530]  We got Geoff in there?
[36:01.250 --> 36:01.550]  Yes.
[36:01.690 --> 36:02.350]  Yes, Geoff's in.
[36:02.490 --> 36:02.650]  Cool.
[36:02.870 --> 36:03.130]  All right.
[36:04.270 --> 36:05.170]  What killed Geoff?
[36:06.130 --> 36:06.910]  I guess we're going to find out.
[36:07.710 --> 36:08.350]  He killed himself.
[36:08.490 --> 36:09.110]  No, he didn't.
[36:09.630 --> 36:10.550]  Yes, he jumped down the hole.
[36:11.050 --> 36:11.370]  Geoff.
[36:11.870 --> 36:14.450]  Or he stood in the cauldron and it launched him into the hole.
[36:14.490 --> 36:14.810]  Geoff!
[36:14.870 --> 36:15.770]  Oh, that would have been rough.
[36:19.950 --> 36:20.950]  I guess we'll find out.
[36:23.150 --> 36:24.430]  Stay away from the hole, guys!
[36:24.530 --> 36:25.650]  Stay away from the hole!
[36:26.250 --> 36:26.610]  Okay.
[36:29.270 --> 36:29.630]  So...
[36:29.630 --> 36:30.270]  Stay away from that hole!
[36:30.510 --> 36:31.830]  When we do the first...
[36:31.830 --> 36:31.890]  Hey.
[36:32.190 --> 36:32.530]  Hey.
[36:32.890 --> 36:33.070]  Hey.
[36:33.310 --> 36:38.270]  When we do the first extraction, whatever we have bonus comes out as like a money thing.
[36:38.790 --> 36:39.510]  Oh, a money bag.
[36:39.770 --> 36:39.930]  Yep.
[36:40.070 --> 36:40.250]  Got it.
[36:40.550 --> 36:41.550]  Do you need help, Geoff?
[36:41.550 --> 36:42.670]  I wish we could pop this open.
[36:43.010 --> 36:43.350]  Geoff.
[36:43.350 --> 36:44.370]  I have one health.
[36:44.690 --> 36:45.190]  I'll give you one.
[36:45.270 --> 36:45.610]  I'll give you one.
[36:46.070 --> 36:46.990]  I'll give you one also.
[36:47.190 --> 36:47.550]  I'll give you one.
[36:47.770 --> 36:48.070]  There you go.
[36:48.630 --> 36:49.010]  Thank you.
[36:49.170 --> 36:49.330]  Go for it.
[36:50.050 --> 36:50.770]  We're a team.
[36:51.650 --> 36:53.050]  Did I do it?
[36:53.690 --> 36:54.070]  No.
[36:55.370 --> 36:56.070]  How do you do it?
[36:56.530 --> 36:57.170]  Hold on.
[36:58.710 --> 36:59.250]  Thanks, bud.
[36:59.830 --> 37:00.870]  Ow, I'm getting bunced.
[37:02.670 --> 37:03.490]  Yeah, it's Nick.
[37:04.130 --> 37:04.770]  Yeah, I'm helping.
[37:05.110 --> 37:05.930]  I need to buy your back.
[37:06.090 --> 37:06.670]  Oh my god.
[37:07.610 --> 37:07.950]  There we go.
[37:08.150 --> 37:08.450]  Thank you.
[37:08.670 --> 37:09.910]  It can't be both shows, bud.
[37:10.350 --> 37:10.950]  Sure it can.
[37:14.470 --> 37:14.790]  Why not?
[37:15.550 --> 37:16.810]  Sure it can.
[37:20.790 --> 37:21.830]  Nothing in here.
[37:22.250 --> 37:23.710]  I already got the thing that was over there.
[37:25.150 --> 37:26.690]  Sure it can is so funny.
[37:28.750 --> 37:29.690]  It can't be both shows.
[37:29.810 --> 37:31.130]  Yes, it is.
[37:32.490 --> 37:33.010]  Help me.
[37:33.870 --> 37:34.470]  With what?
[37:35.330 --> 37:36.110]  A big ass vase.
[37:36.750 --> 37:37.030]  Oh.
[37:39.430 --> 37:39.970]  Help me.
[37:40.030 --> 37:40.350]  I'm stuck.
[37:40.910 --> 37:41.190]  Hang on.
[37:41.270 --> 37:41.510]  I'm coming.
[37:42.170 --> 37:42.650]  Thank you.
[37:43.930 --> 37:44.630]  One's with me.
[37:45.270 --> 37:45.410]  Cool.
[37:45.730 --> 37:46.050]  There we go.
[37:46.110 --> 37:47.030]  Oh, that's perfect.
[37:47.770 --> 37:48.490]  Great job.
[37:48.630 --> 37:49.470]  Oh, Nick, hold on.
[37:49.490 --> 37:49.890]  We're not done.
[37:51.030 --> 37:51.490]  Oh.
[37:51.970 --> 37:52.730]  Ooh, careful.
[37:54.290 --> 37:55.270]  Ooh, that's pretty.
[37:58.350 --> 38:00.090]  This reminds me of Polish pottery.
[38:00.190 --> 38:01.550]  My mom has a shit ton of that stuff.
[38:02.330 --> 38:04.530]  It seems like there's probably something up high.
[38:04.670 --> 38:06.510]  What the fuck is Polish pottery?
[38:07.010 --> 38:09.550]  It's like that blue and white part.
[38:10.170 --> 38:11.190]  Yeah, that's Polish.
[38:11.410 --> 38:12.810]  It's just blue and white?
[38:14.010 --> 38:15.030]  Yeah, it's blue and white.
[38:15.690 --> 38:18.430]  But usually it's like a dish or a cup or something or a mug.
[38:19.890 --> 38:20.530]  It's pretty.
[38:21.930 --> 38:22.710]  It is pretty.
[38:23.170 --> 38:24.470]  It's got a real homesthetic, you know?
[38:25.230 --> 38:25.750]  Something like that.
[38:25.850 --> 38:27.170]  I feel like it's got a real grandparent.
[38:28.310 --> 38:30.570]  Well, she is a grandparent now, so that works.
[38:31.950 --> 38:32.270]  Huh.
[38:32.310 --> 38:33.050]  Nothing in there.
[38:33.430 --> 38:33.790]  Nope.
[38:34.950 --> 38:39.530]  They issue you when your first grandchild is born to get your first set of Polish pottery.
[38:40.350 --> 38:42.230]  Well, she inherited it way before that.
[38:44.710 --> 38:47.690]  Guys, I have a feeling that we're about to get close to something coming after us.
[38:47.710 --> 38:48.550]  Oh, there's something up here, guys.
[38:51.130 --> 38:51.810]  Help me out.
[38:52.050 --> 38:53.150]  How do we get this?
[38:53.770 --> 38:54.190]  Where are you?
[38:54.410 --> 38:55.710]  Over here. You see that face up there?
[38:57.430 --> 38:58.790]  What the fuck is that?
[38:59.370 --> 39:00.390]  Oh, I got it. Okay.
[39:01.390 --> 39:01.970]  There's a face?
[39:02.270 --> 39:03.270]  Oh, goblins!
[39:04.270 --> 39:04.490]  Sorry.
[39:04.990 --> 39:07.730]  Oh, I just watched Nick get battered.
[39:07.790 --> 39:09.210]  Here you go. See if anything's up there.
[39:09.730 --> 39:10.310]  Put me down!
[39:10.530 --> 39:11.190]  Is anything up there?
[39:11.850 --> 39:12.570]  Do you see anything?
[39:13.290 --> 39:15.650]  Dude, if I could lift a kid to clean like this, I would.
[39:19.590 --> 39:21.650]  That's, uh... we're doing pretty good. We only have 16 grand.
[39:21.930 --> 39:26.570]  Yeah, but we gotta be careful because we haven't run into anything, like, nasty yet, and I have a feeling it's coming.
[39:27.090 --> 39:28.990]  I feel like I can hear a cat purring around there.
[39:29.010 --> 39:30.690]  Yeah, there's something. There's something in there, too.
[39:31.170 --> 39:31.770]  Is it a kitty cat?
[39:32.230 --> 39:33.690]  Oh, there you go. Grab that thing.
[39:35.050 --> 39:36.110]  Are you not gonna get that cup?
[39:37.090 --> 39:37.870]  He just left it.
[39:38.970 --> 39:41.550]  Oh, it's only $1300. Gavin doesn't get out of bed for us.
[39:41.550 --> 39:43.670]  Gavin thinks that's small change.
[39:43.830 --> 39:45.250]  Well, you're not already grabbing it? I thought you were grabbing it.
[39:45.750 --> 39:49.590]  No, you just came up right behind me on everything that I was doing and then didn't do anything.
[39:51.210 --> 39:52.770]  See? See? Like right now.
[39:53.690 --> 39:54.450]  Okay, let me help.
[39:55.450 --> 39:59.770]  Oh my god. Guys, we're about to lose $1900. Oh my god.
[40:01.110 --> 40:02.070]  I found the extraction.
[40:02.730 --> 40:02.950]  Okay.
[40:03.110 --> 40:03.470]  Nice.
[40:04.390 --> 40:06.230]  It's back that way, but we can keep grabbing shit.
[40:06.470 --> 40:07.410]  Let's have a look around here.
[40:07.510 --> 40:07.930]  Back this way?
[40:08.990 --> 40:10.230]  Yeah, back, uh...
[40:10.230 --> 40:12.050]  Back that way for the lock fucking thing.
[40:12.290 --> 40:12.370]  Yeah.
[40:13.370 --> 40:14.750]  But there's so much money in there.
[40:14.750 --> 40:18.630]  In the comments, let us know. Give us tips. What are we supposed to do? What are we supposed to do with the locked stuff?
[40:18.970 --> 40:19.730]  It's gotta be something.
[40:21.330 --> 40:22.250]  Hang on. I'm coming.
[40:22.270 --> 40:24.190]  Another fucking thing Gavin left in that drawer. Hold on.
[40:24.190 --> 40:26.350]  That's what I'm talking about. It's what he keeps doing.
[40:26.690 --> 40:29.670]  Where did the fucking... Where did the house... Where did the cart go?
[40:29.670 --> 40:30.330]  Where'd the cart go?
[40:30.490 --> 40:30.830]  Over here.
[40:30.990 --> 40:32.530]  Guys, where'd the house go?
[40:32.570 --> 40:34.850]  Over here. Over here. The house is here.
[40:34.890 --> 40:35.190]  For our belongings.
[40:36.790 --> 40:37.630]  The stuffed house is here.
[40:38.850 --> 40:40.550]  You think there's stuff up high in here?
[40:40.550 --> 40:42.930]  Yeah, yes, definitely. And I think there's stuff...
[40:42.930 --> 40:43.990]  What the fuck?!
[40:44.750 --> 40:45.210]  Alright, alright.
[40:47.110 --> 40:48.170]  Just sit in the cauldron?
[40:49.730 --> 40:50.950]  Nick was just hanging out in the cauldron.
[40:51.570 --> 40:52.870]  Should we blast up that?
[40:53.030 --> 40:53.870]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[40:53.870 --> 40:54.490]  Should we blast up that with the cauldron?
[40:54.770 --> 40:54.970]  Yeah.
[40:55.130 --> 40:55.630]  Yeah, let's do it.
[40:55.750 --> 40:56.610]  Send me!
[40:59.410 --> 41:00.050]  Creepy noise.
[41:00.670 --> 41:01.270]  Is there anything up there?
[41:01.630 --> 41:02.310]  Oh, you didn't make it.
[41:02.510 --> 41:03.070]  I didn't make it.
[41:05.110 --> 41:06.650]  Do you have to crouch in it to get sent?
[41:07.050 --> 41:07.870]  I don't know.
[41:08.110 --> 41:09.270]  I'm gonna try standing up.
[41:10.890 --> 41:11.210]  Ow!
[41:12.350 --> 41:14.290]  Oh, it launches you backwards. Let me try that.
[41:14.290 --> 41:15.730]  Oh, okay. Face me.
[41:18.970 --> 41:19.410]  Oh!
[41:20.270 --> 41:21.150]  Oh, wow!
[41:22.450 --> 41:22.970]  I'm up here!
[41:25.230 --> 41:27.530]  Alright, I'm gonna face a different way.
[41:27.930 --> 41:28.090]  Okay.
[41:29.590 --> 41:30.030]  Giovanni!
[41:33.970 --> 41:36.270]  You hit the ceiling so hard!
[41:38.030 --> 41:38.470]  Here you go, buddy.
[41:38.890 --> 41:40.010]  Oh, you can lift him up there!
[41:40.730 --> 41:41.470]  Yeah, no shit!
[41:42.710 --> 41:44.250]  Yeah, stand on a table or something.
[41:46.450 --> 41:48.230]  Everyone's just giving me tips and tricks, guys.
[41:48.490 --> 41:49.690]  Stand on a table or something.
[41:50.190 --> 41:51.330]  Jump, jump, jump, jump.
[41:54.130 --> 41:56.050]  Is there anything on top of the other one, Gavin?
[41:57.150 --> 41:57.990]  Not that I can see.
[41:58.730 --> 41:59.010]  Okay.
[41:59.870 --> 42:00.270]  Alright, boys.
[42:00.670 --> 42:01.570]  I think we got it, fellas!
[42:02.170 --> 42:03.050]  Yeah, I think we're doing pretty good.
[42:04.030 --> 42:05.670]  Just be careful, and we're alright.
[42:06.790 --> 42:08.170]  Yeah, I don't see anything else on the radar.
[42:08.470 --> 42:09.330]  Map, whatever it is.
[42:09.690 --> 42:10.750]  Alright, who wants to push?
[42:11.730 --> 42:12.290]  I'll push.
[42:12.650 --> 42:12.910]  Okay.
[42:15.170 --> 42:16.550]  Someone open the door?
[42:18.070 --> 42:18.750]  Look out, Geoff.
[42:19.150 --> 42:20.270]  Oh, we lost the monkey.
[42:22.090 --> 42:23.750]  Did Geoff just use the... what was that?
[42:23.930 --> 42:25.010]  No, he just opened it.
[42:25.350 --> 42:25.830]  Is it the door?
[42:26.430 --> 42:26.730]  Yeah.
[42:26.750 --> 42:27.510]  I thought you put something in it.
[42:27.570 --> 42:27.690]  No.
[42:27.870 --> 42:28.630]  I put my monkey back in.
[42:29.050 --> 42:30.030]  I did. Don't worry.
[42:30.570 --> 42:31.330]  I won't forget your monk.
[42:34.010 --> 42:35.990]  Okay, we just have to be careful on the way back. That's it.
[42:36.590 --> 42:37.090]  That's it.
[42:38.570 --> 42:40.030]  Ooh, we're getting a tax return. Nice.
[42:40.750 --> 42:41.150]  Cool.
[42:45.640 --> 42:48.340]  Dude, we only needed 9. We got 24. That rocks.
[42:49.060 --> 42:49.540]  Yeah, right?
[42:49.760 --> 42:50.040]  That was really good.
[42:51.600 --> 42:52.000]  Wow.
[42:53.340 --> 42:53.740]  Great.
[42:54.140 --> 42:54.280]  Sweet.
[42:54.540 --> 42:56.280]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[42:59.040 --> 43:00.600]  It seems a little bit scarier now.
[43:01.080 --> 43:01.280]  Yeah.
[43:01.540 --> 43:01.880]  It's dark.
[43:03.540 --> 43:04.200]  What's that big light?
[43:04.240 --> 43:05.440]  Ooh, what is that?
[43:06.160 --> 43:07.560]  Is that an eye? What is that?
[43:07.700 --> 43:08.660]  Yep, that's an eye.
[43:09.440 --> 43:10.140]  Don't look at it.
[43:10.140 --> 43:12.240]  Guys, help me.
[43:12.440 --> 43:12.740]  Leave me.
[43:13.300 --> 43:14.320]  What are we going to do?
[43:14.780 --> 43:16.340]  I saw the door. I'm backing towards it.
[43:16.360 --> 43:16.780]  Oh my God, it's a reaper.
[43:17.020 --> 43:17.440]  Oh God.
[43:17.720 --> 43:18.420]  Oh shit.
[43:18.700 --> 43:19.900]  Guys, I'm free of the eye.
[43:20.580 --> 43:22.400]  No, you're not. You're dead.
[43:22.960 --> 43:25.080]  You are definitely dead.
[43:25.200 --> 43:26.260]  Am I going to get reaped?
[43:26.600 --> 43:27.000]  No.
[43:27.520 --> 43:28.960]  Oh, I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
[43:29.320 --> 43:33.900]  Dude, there is a giant monster that walks around.
[43:33.900 --> 43:35.660]  It looks like that thing has been spirited away.
[43:35.700 --> 43:36.480]  Yes, it does.
[43:37.360 --> 43:38.020]  Yeah, there it is.
[43:38.120 --> 43:38.400]  Oh yeah.
[43:40.860 --> 43:42.400]  Oh my God.
[43:42.400 --> 43:43.820]  Okay, guys, I know you're alive.
[43:45.960 --> 43:46.400]  Well, dead.
[43:48.580 --> 43:48.940]  Gavin.
[43:49.200 --> 43:49.760]  I have to wait.
[43:49.940 --> 43:52.360]  Are you screaming about the reaper in the high pitch?
[43:53.920 --> 43:56.160]  And then the thing from Spirit of the Way came and killed you.
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.780]  The eye made me walk into its mouth.
[44:00.820 --> 44:01.240]  I know.
[44:01.560 --> 44:02.840]  It happened to me too, I think.
[44:02.920 --> 44:04.760]  I was like, I'm free of the eye, and then I died.
[44:09.910 --> 44:10.490]  It's all on Eric.
[44:10.690 --> 44:11.510]  It's all on Eric.
[44:12.310 --> 44:13.370]  Saved three lives.
[44:19.630 --> 44:21.390]  He's not going to be able to get us all.
[44:21.550 --> 44:21.990]  Sure he will.
[44:22.990 --> 44:23.210]  Okay.
[44:23.890 --> 44:24.750]  Well, the eye might.
[44:25.130 --> 44:25.490]  Fuck him.
[44:26.850 --> 44:27.830]  The eye might be gone.
[44:28.450 --> 44:29.250]  Wow, we should...
[44:29.250 --> 44:33.270]  I didn't realize we needed to be that much more careful since we didn't run anything in the...
[44:33.270 --> 44:35.310]  Maybe that's why we didn't need to be that careful.
[44:35.370 --> 44:35.990]  I guess so.
[44:38.790 --> 44:41.150]  Where is the eye in reference to where we were?
[44:41.150 --> 44:42.050]  It vanished.
[44:42.210 --> 44:43.270]  It was on the railings there.
[44:43.610 --> 44:44.430]  Is that you, Nick?
[44:44.530 --> 44:45.150]  Or you, Gavin?
[44:45.310 --> 44:45.750]  I can't tell.
[44:46.430 --> 44:47.870]  I think that's Gavin.
[44:47.890 --> 44:48.490]  That's me he's got.
[44:48.850 --> 44:50.550]  Yeah, because it's me and Nye right there.
[44:50.750 --> 44:51.610]  Yeah, I'm just right there.
[44:51.750 --> 44:52.410]  Is he just going to...
[44:52.410 --> 44:54.950]  Luckily, slowly move a pile of heads towards the exit.
[44:58.630 --> 45:00.910]  Well, he should bring one of us back so we can all...
[45:00.910 --> 45:01.530]  We can help.
[45:01.730 --> 45:02.150]  We're doing good.
[45:02.250 --> 45:02.730]  We're doing good.
[45:04.090 --> 45:08.210]  Because now that the thing has been spawned, he can just take him right to the ship and we'll come back instantly.
[45:09.150 --> 45:10.470]  Oh, does he know that?
[45:10.470 --> 45:11.990]  You're going to come with me?
[45:11.990 --> 45:12.550]  He doesn't.
[45:12.870 --> 45:14.050]  But now I think he realizes it.
[45:14.230 --> 45:15.150]  I know where they are.
[45:20.390 --> 45:21.810]  He's totally got to run.
[45:24.890 --> 45:25.410]  No!
[45:28.130 --> 45:29.650]  How did he get me?
[45:30.350 --> 45:31.210]  He crouched.
[45:32.930 --> 45:34.230]  That was horrific.
[45:35.410 --> 45:38.910]  Dude, I was so locked in.
[45:38.910 --> 45:40.730]  Oh, it was so horrific.
[45:41.430 --> 45:44.150]  That was the scariest thing I've ever seen.
[45:44.710 --> 45:46.890]  Dude, I was so locked in.
[45:47.070 --> 45:48.150]  Eli Roth wishes.
[45:48.530 --> 45:49.690]  Oh my God.
[46:00.460 --> 46:01.340]  Hold your fire!
[46:02.340 --> 46:03.880]  Die! Die!
[46:05.540 --> 46:06.100]  Die!
[46:15.370 --> 46:16.870]  Why does it say a three now?
[46:17.050 --> 46:17.870]  I don't know how to throw shit.
[46:20.950 --> 46:22.070]  Where's my...
[46:23.030 --> 46:23.590]  Gavin!
[46:24.150 --> 46:24.490]  Ow!
[46:24.730 --> 46:26.290]  Gavin! Stop shooting me!
[46:29.450 --> 46:30.770]  Get me Gavin!
[46:32.210 --> 46:34.410]  Ooh, what's this?
[46:36.370 --> 46:37.410]  Why can't I take this bottle?
[46:49.370 --> 46:50.350]  Let's celebrate!
[46:55.340 --> 46:56.120]  Oh, I've got a sledgehammer.
[46:59.240 --> 47:00.060]  That's it!
[47:00.260 --> 47:01.260]  He did it!
[47:02.240 --> 47:03.080]  Wow, Nick!
[47:03.200 --> 47:03.800]  Way to go!
[47:04.120 --> 47:06.040]  Did I hit myself with a sledgehammer?
[47:06.060 --> 47:07.100]  No, I brought it down on you.
[47:07.380 --> 47:07.820]  I had it.
[47:07.940 --> 47:08.220]  Okay.
[47:09.400 --> 47:10.890]  So, what did that...
[47:11.840 --> 47:13.940]  I think it's just an in-between thing.
[47:16.340 --> 47:17.120]  Oh, I just...
[47:17.120 --> 47:18.200]  I get the crown.
[47:18.440 --> 47:18.860]  Crown!
[47:19.060 --> 47:19.540]  I got the crown!
[47:20.800 --> 47:21.840]  Well, that's fun, guys.
