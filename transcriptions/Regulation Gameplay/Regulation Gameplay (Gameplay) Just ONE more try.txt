[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  I think if you hit the seagull, he'll probably carry it over.
[00:02.200 --> 00:03.820]  Might be full beans to do it, honestly.
[00:05.560 --> 00:06.100]  I put up!
[00:06.580 --> 00:06.840]  Oh!
[00:07.160 --> 00:08.160]  But it wasn't open.
[00:08.280 --> 00:09.520]  Oh, it doesn't need to be!
[00:09.520 --> 00:10.260]  It doesn't matter!
[00:10.360 --> 00:10.960]  Oh shit!
[00:11.560 --> 00:12.540]  Oh my god!
[00:12.760 --> 00:13.420]  Oh, he did it!
[00:13.780 --> 00:14.480]  Oh, he did it!
[00:14.920 --> 00:15.560]  He did it!
[00:15.580 --> 00:15.920]  Fuck!
[00:17.000 --> 00:17.400]  Wow!
[00:19.020 --> 00:21.380]  Holy shit, I thought I messed that right up.
[00:23.160 --> 00:23.880]  He's done it.
[00:24.360 --> 00:24.880]  No, he's not.
[00:25.240 --> 00:25.300]  Nope.
[00:26.080 --> 00:26.980]  Thought I had it.
[00:27.840 --> 00:28.240]  Try!
[00:28.240 --> 00:30.820]  That was a fuck you clam if I ever saw one.
[00:34.680 --> 00:36.340]  I don't know what...
[00:36.340 --> 00:36.820]  What?
[00:37.400 --> 00:38.460]  That's so unfair.
[00:39.300 --> 00:39.960]  It's four.
[00:40.200 --> 00:41.080]  Oh no, it's par four.
[00:42.460 --> 00:43.060]  There you go.
[00:43.140 --> 00:43.940]  What a shot!
[00:45.500 --> 00:47.080]  His mouth was open!
[00:47.080 --> 00:48.180]  His mouth was open!
[00:49.400 --> 00:50.940]  That's so unfair!
[00:52.760 --> 00:54.560]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do about...
[00:54.560 --> 00:56.020]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do about him.
[00:56.500 --> 00:57.700]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[00:57.700 --> 00:59.420]  I've hit him three times.
