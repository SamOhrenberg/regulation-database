[00:00.000 --> 00:04.580]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Friday gaming stream.
[00:04.640 --> 00:07.160]  Today, we're going to be playing Pico Park.
[00:07.220 --> 00:09.780]  If you tuned in a few weeks ago, you saw us play it.
[00:10.060 --> 00:11.220]  You saw peak teamwork.
[00:11.840 --> 00:17.340]  You saw what it means to the dictionary definition of a well-oiled machine,
[00:17.340 --> 00:18.140]  if you will.
[00:18.580 --> 00:22.200]  However, we weren't able in the abbreviated time to complete the game.
[00:22.280 --> 00:24.140]  So today we're going to knock out the final few stages.
[00:24.380 --> 00:26.360]  It'll be what they call a textbook.
[00:26.920 --> 00:27.900]  It's going to be a thing of beauty.
[00:27.900 --> 00:31.580]  We're excited for you to get to see us at our peak performance.
[00:31.840 --> 00:34.920]  Yep. What color is Andrew supposed to be, Nick?
[00:35.300 --> 00:37.000]  He's supposed to be red.
[00:37.480 --> 00:39.380]  Oh, Nick, with the outline.
[00:39.840 --> 00:40.720]  I have text.
[00:40.900 --> 00:43.420]  I'm getting better at Photoshop. All right.
[00:45.540 --> 00:47.420]  That's our that's our audio editor, folks.
[00:47.520 --> 00:50.440]  Yeah. He's had to learn a lot about other things. Yeah.
[00:51.980 --> 00:54.700]  God, I'm so overwhelmed with piss rats. I love it.
[00:55.300 --> 00:57.060]  We're awash in piss rats.
[00:57.060 --> 00:59.220]  We can't read it in the chat because it's a rat.
[00:59.700 --> 01:01.120]  Golden shower of piss rat.
[01:01.680 --> 01:03.120]  Andrew, are you jumping in or what?
[01:03.260 --> 01:05.060]  I'm jumping in.
[01:05.200 --> 01:06.180]  I'm going to turn Andrew up.
[01:06.300 --> 01:09.000]  So, Andrew, are you on your new setup or did you switch back to your old one?
[01:09.060 --> 01:10.540]  I've swapped back to my old one.
[01:10.620 --> 01:12.100]  All right. He is turned down.
[01:12.420 --> 01:15.620]  So I'm going to turn everybody else down by associate.
[01:15.820 --> 01:17.240]  I'm on my new setup still.
[01:17.380 --> 01:18.800]  What color am I supposed to be again, sir?
[01:18.980 --> 01:19.580]  Red. You're red.
[01:20.700 --> 01:22.000]  Thank you. Jesus.
[01:24.160 --> 01:25.640]  Well, you laugh. Hey, there is.
[01:25.640 --> 01:27.560]  Oh, just incompetence.
[01:27.600 --> 01:30.800]  Hey, the state of this company.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.620]  Man, I cannot blow my speaker out or blow my mic out.
[01:35.680 --> 01:37.040]  This is great. Great.
[01:37.560 --> 01:41.540]  So I think I got the red five, five left.
[01:41.700 --> 01:45.020]  This is easy. Are you guys ready for more Pico Park action?
[01:45.380 --> 01:46.880]  No. OK.
[01:47.740 --> 01:49.520]  Did we? Yes. So, OK.
[01:50.380 --> 01:51.760]  I thought we missed one somewhere back.
[01:51.840 --> 01:52.280]  Why are we waiting?
[01:52.680 --> 01:54.560]  Oh, what? What the fuck is this?
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.040]  Not tricky towers again.
[01:56.540 --> 01:57.860]  Tricky towers. The seconds.
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.980]  What are we supposed to do here?
[02:01.160 --> 02:02.460]  I don't know how to move my.
[02:02.840 --> 02:04.300]  What? Oh, I'm orange. Oh, what are we?
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.320]  Am I dead? But how do you switch your shit around?
[02:07.560 --> 02:08.320]  Oh, I see.
[02:09.060 --> 02:09.760]  Are we building?
[02:10.060 --> 02:12.020]  Are we building the map that we have to run across?
[02:12.360 --> 02:14.540]  I think we're trying to make a Tetris. But.
[02:16.100 --> 02:17.640]  But what? OK.
[02:18.360 --> 02:19.440]  I didn't sign up for this.
[02:20.400 --> 02:21.600]  Does that mean we have to get your son?
[02:23.060 --> 02:24.040]  There we go.
[02:24.040 --> 02:24.700]  How do I turn it?
[02:24.840 --> 02:25.220]  How do you turn it?
[02:25.220 --> 02:25.800]  Put that in there, Blue.
[02:26.060 --> 02:26.400]  Spacebar.
[02:26.400 --> 02:27.280]  Oh, it's on your controller.
[02:29.740 --> 02:30.080]  Spacebar.
[02:30.080 --> 02:30.560]  Blue, get it in there.
[02:30.960 --> 02:32.020]  OK, good job, Blue.
[02:33.380 --> 02:35.120]  Can I dock midair to someone?
[02:35.120 --> 02:36.440]  Tetris! Oh, wait, who fucked up the right?
[02:37.560 --> 02:37.900]  Purple?
[02:38.960 --> 02:40.320]  What the fuck is a Tetris?
[02:41.520 --> 02:42.280]  It's four lines.
[02:42.780 --> 02:42.940]  Oh!
[02:43.240 --> 02:44.800]  It's when you get the line in and it fucking disappears.
[02:44.860 --> 02:46.140]  What are you talking about?
[02:46.300 --> 02:47.320]  What are you talking about?
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.520]  A Tetris!
[02:49.380 --> 02:51.500]  How can you get one, though, if there's no four?
[02:51.920 --> 02:53.120]  These aren't tetrominoes.
[02:53.120 --> 02:56.020]  Purple isn't helping us at all.
[02:56.020 --> 02:58.040]  I was a Sonic Bean Machine player.
[02:58.120 --> 02:59.180]  What the hell is this?
[03:00.400 --> 03:00.920]  Tetris?
[03:01.760 --> 03:02.560]  OK, Eric.
[03:02.700 --> 03:04.280]  I'm going to need you to clarify.
[03:05.400 --> 03:06.440]  What do you mean?
[03:06.720 --> 03:07.760]  Clear the lines!
[03:08.880 --> 03:09.760]  It's Tetris!
[03:10.580 --> 03:11.660]  They're not clearing, Eric.
[03:12.300 --> 03:14.800]  We don't have a single line with all this mess.
[03:15.340 --> 03:17.940]  We don't have any single line all the way across.
[03:17.940 --> 03:19.940]  What are you guys talking about?
[03:20.160 --> 03:21.560]  I assume you can make one right now.
[03:21.640 --> 03:22.200]  Yes, I can.
[03:22.660 --> 03:25.040]  We did it!
[03:25.540 --> 03:26.660]  We just gotta reset.
[03:27.020 --> 03:28.080]  It's enough to me.
[03:28.600 --> 03:30.520]  I feel crazy.
[03:31.280 --> 03:33.180]  You don't know what Tetris is?
[03:33.460 --> 03:37.700]  I mean, when you call it a Tetris, it sounds fucking stupid.
[03:38.520 --> 03:39.780]  I didn't name it!
[03:40.220 --> 03:41.700]  It's just a line, Eric!
[03:42.920 --> 03:43.980]  It's a line!
[03:44.340 --> 03:45.160]  Make the line!
[03:49.660 --> 03:52.720]  I'm the only one trying to fill in gaps and we didn't have any gaps.
[03:52.820 --> 03:54.040]  Can we just hit start and restart?
[03:55.860 --> 03:56.660]  Oh, man.
[03:57.060 --> 03:58.620]  Yeah, sure.
[03:59.700 --> 04:01.260]  So, Tetris.
[04:01.740 --> 04:03.400]  We are trying to just...
[04:03.400 --> 04:04.060]  An eye of orange.
[04:06.100 --> 04:08.460]  I'll be honest, I thought it was red for the first half of that.
[04:10.200 --> 04:12.800]  We didn't clarify what color it was.
[04:13.900 --> 04:15.260]  No, I definitely knew who you were.
[04:15.360 --> 04:15.820]  I just forgot.
[04:15.820 --> 04:17.260]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[04:17.780 --> 04:18.140]  What do you mean?
[04:19.180 --> 04:19.880]  Are you blue?
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.080]  Why are you doing what you're doing?
[04:23.680 --> 04:25.080]  Why did you do this?
[04:25.700 --> 04:27.920]  You dumb asshole, what are you doing?
[04:28.240 --> 04:29.520]  You dumb bastard!
[04:29.640 --> 04:31.580]  What is wrong with you?
[04:31.800 --> 04:32.760]  You're a fucking idiot!
[04:34.060 --> 04:37.020]  We need to go out of town so that way we don't have to deal with this shit.
[04:37.360 --> 04:38.320]  You leave.
[04:38.800 --> 04:40.860]  I hope that you're going home.
[04:42.520 --> 04:43.740]  He's going home, folks.
[04:43.740 --> 04:44.780]  Let's go England.
[04:46.700 --> 04:47.740]  Let's go England.
[04:49.720 --> 04:50.940]  Oh my god.
[04:51.920 --> 04:53.660]  This is not as high octane.
[04:54.160 --> 04:55.600]  You are such a minute.
[04:55.780 --> 04:56.720]  This sucks shit.
[04:59.480 --> 05:00.360]  This isn't...
[05:00.360 --> 05:01.020]  There, I'm helping.
[05:02.360 --> 05:03.720]  Nick, you're the only one...
[05:03.720 --> 05:04.880]  I appreciate you, Nick.
[05:05.940 --> 05:06.820]  Nick immediately...
[05:06.820 --> 05:09.760]  He got the direction, he figured it out, and he's crushing it.
[05:10.280 --> 05:11.060]  Gavin's an idiot.
[05:11.060 --> 05:12.220]  It was...
[05:12.220 --> 05:13.600]  I don't think that's right.
[05:15.220 --> 05:16.260]  We need to get a Tetris.
[05:17.020 --> 05:18.880]  Get out of my bay, Eric.
[05:19.020 --> 05:20.000]  I didn't name it!
[05:20.720 --> 05:22.400]  Why won't it let me turn the piece?
[05:22.580 --> 05:23.080]  There we go.
[05:24.740 --> 05:26.320]  What does there we go mean?
[05:26.580 --> 05:29.860]  We can't get a Tetris, everything's blocked on the left.
[05:30.040 --> 05:30.960]  Can we restart this, please?
[05:31.480 --> 05:32.400]  Oh my god.
[05:32.500 --> 05:34.100]  Andrew killed us.
[05:34.680 --> 05:37.860]  I'm Geoff for the 50th time.
[05:38.220 --> 05:39.000]  I'm red.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.040]  You're not red, I'm red.
[05:41.200 --> 05:43.020]  I'm clearly not red, I'm kicking ass.
[05:43.100 --> 05:44.680]  But I'm saying, what did red do over there?
[05:44.840 --> 05:47.300]  Red didn't do it, it was all Gavin.
[05:48.040 --> 05:48.840]  Alright, for real now.
[05:49.940 --> 05:50.980]  Fuck you, shut up.
[05:51.740 --> 05:52.220]  Spacebar!
[05:54.180 --> 05:55.140]  Holy god,
[05:55.240 --> 05:56.760]  this is truly...
[05:56.760 --> 05:58.260]  Here, I got this one laid down now.
[05:58.420 --> 06:00.520]  I'm making some neat shit right here.
[06:00.640 --> 06:02.880]  If you're watching this live right now,
[06:03.120 --> 06:05.080]  boy, are you gonna be excited tomorrow.
[06:05.960 --> 06:06.820]  There we go.
[06:06.820 --> 06:07.840]  Because we've got
[06:08.420 --> 06:10.820]  our Chain Together video coming out.
[06:11.080 --> 06:11.900]  There you go.
[06:12.060 --> 06:14.760]  Check out Unchained on the Regulation Gameplay channel.
[06:15.500 --> 06:16.940]  Eric, get out of my business.
[06:21.180 --> 06:21.660]  No!
[06:23.280 --> 06:25.100]  Alright, Andrew is a little quiet,
[06:25.200 --> 06:25.580]  apparently.
[06:26.160 --> 06:28.980]  No, fucking green!
[06:29.500 --> 06:30.480]  Matter of opinion, I think.
[06:30.740 --> 06:32.100]  Andrew, what have you put that there for?
[06:33.700 --> 06:34.900]  You block me!
[06:35.640 --> 06:37.080]  This is my region!
[06:37.900 --> 06:39.060]  I was trying to fill
[06:39.060 --> 06:39.840]  an empty space.
[06:40.200 --> 06:43.060]  Ray would be rolling over in his grave right now.
[06:43.400 --> 06:43.460]  Yeah.
[06:44.760 --> 06:46.440]  Alright, I guess I busted out because
[06:46.440 --> 06:47.900]  this is getting pretty high.
[06:48.760 --> 06:49.560]  Lost at sea.
[06:51.940 --> 06:53.360]  I think we're doing great.
[06:53.560 --> 06:54.120]  We only need three more.
[06:54.120 --> 06:57.120]  I think we only need to get a couple more Tetrises.
[06:57.660 --> 06:58.640]  Sorry, that's what it's called.
[06:59.440 --> 07:01.100]  Is it really just called a Tetris
[07:01.100 --> 07:01.820]  when you line them up in a line?
[07:01.820 --> 07:03.820]  When you're eliminating it, you have a block,
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  you have the line all the way across, and it's in four.
[07:06.140 --> 07:06.600]  It's a Tetris.
[07:06.740 --> 07:09.860]  That's so lame. That's the lamest shit I've ever heard.
[07:09.940 --> 07:11.800]  Is it lamer than a full
[07:11.800 --> 07:13.360]  Scrabble being called a bingo, though?
[07:14.000 --> 07:14.740]  Is it really?
[07:15.640 --> 07:16.720]  We went over this.
[07:17.900 --> 07:18.300]  Okay!
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.080]  The Tetris is
[07:22.080 --> 07:22.900]  four at once.
[07:23.800 --> 07:25.280]  We needed to do that.
[07:26.240 --> 07:27.660]  The ten was the total.
[07:28.380 --> 07:29.820]  Four lines at once is a Tetris.
[07:29.820 --> 07:31.200]  We need to get a Tetris.
[07:31.420 --> 07:34.080]  I hope we don't do it again.
[07:34.200 --> 07:35.320]  That was boring as shit.
[07:35.480 --> 07:37.080]  That was the worst level.
[07:37.500 --> 07:38.260]  Oh my god.
[07:39.100 --> 07:40.720]  Oh my god.
[07:41.260 --> 07:42.740]  This is perfect.
[07:44.980 --> 07:46.060]  Oh, this is actually...
[07:46.060 --> 07:47.500]  This is awesome.
[07:48.480 --> 07:49.100]  Oh shit.
[07:50.160 --> 07:51.360]  Don't let them hit the ground!
[07:52.380 --> 07:53.680]  They disappear if they hit the ground.
[07:57.270 --> 07:58.130]  Andrew's over here
[07:58.130 --> 07:58.830]  and he's killing it.
[07:58.830 --> 08:00.530]  I gotta give it up for Andrew in this one.
[08:01.190 --> 08:02.530]  Andrew's fucking crushing it.
[08:03.330 --> 08:04.090]  Bounce it.
[08:04.230 --> 08:05.750]  No problem at all.
[08:06.030 --> 08:07.550]  He's just over in his zone.
[08:08.790 --> 08:10.930]  There's only one piece left on my side.
[08:12.430 --> 08:14.950]  The ball actually doesn't come to our side very often.
[08:15.150 --> 08:15.510]  There you go.
[08:17.270 --> 08:17.830]  Who's purple?
[08:18.350 --> 08:19.570]  Oh, you trapped it.
[08:20.630 --> 08:21.570]  Trapped and dropped.
[08:22.810 --> 08:23.830]  Shoot it right there.
[08:25.010 --> 08:26.370]  Gonna try to bounce it.
[08:26.370 --> 08:27.330]  There you go.
[08:27.590 --> 08:28.850]  Andrew's locked in.
[08:29.070 --> 08:30.830]  Oh, come on.
[08:32.170 --> 08:33.350]  That's it, that's it.
[08:36.010 --> 08:37.230]  You got it.
[08:38.590 --> 08:40.410]  Put a little too much English on it.
[08:44.560 --> 08:45.120]  Fuck.
[08:46.500 --> 08:47.360]  Why'd you hit it that way?
[08:50.120 --> 08:50.960]  Here we go.
[08:52.920 --> 08:54.340]  You guys got this.
[08:54.760 --> 08:54.880]  Yep.
[08:54.880 --> 08:56.100]  Andrew, they got it.
[08:56.160 --> 08:56.980]  There it is.
[08:59.020 --> 09:00.500]  Out of the way for orange.
[09:00.600 --> 09:01.720]  Someone's gotta open the door.
[09:02.480 --> 09:03.520]  Come on, Nick.
[09:04.760 --> 09:05.500]  Andrew's stinky.
[09:05.940 --> 09:07.240]  I sure am.
[09:08.260 --> 09:10.980]  And I love it.
[09:13.940 --> 09:15.220]  What the hell?
[09:16.580 --> 09:17.060]  No!
[09:19.520 --> 09:20.160]  It's the same thing.
[09:20.220 --> 09:20.980]  This is easy.
[09:22.740 --> 09:24.060]  Alright, I'm still orange.
[09:24.840 --> 09:25.760]  Don't get it twisted.
[09:26.220 --> 09:26.580]  I'm purple.
[09:27.880 --> 09:28.580]  There you go.
[09:29.380 --> 09:30.240]  Wait, who's purple?
[09:30.700 --> 09:31.040]  I am.
[09:31.880 --> 09:33.340]  Oh, I didn't realize it was you, Nick.
[09:34.080 --> 09:36.320]  Whoops, how'd I do that?
[09:36.880 --> 09:37.920]  Oh, I really muffed it.
[09:38.420 --> 09:39.080]  That was a muff.
[09:39.700 --> 09:40.900]  Gavin, you blew it.
[09:42.180 --> 09:44.240]  Remember that band, The Muffs, from the 90s?
[09:44.540 --> 09:46.040]  Was there really a muff band?
[09:46.460 --> 09:47.440]  Yeah, The Muffs.
[09:47.440 --> 09:48.940]  Didn't the singer go recently?
[09:49.400 --> 09:50.540]  Yeah, she did, I think.
[09:53.200 --> 09:54.380]  You hate to lose a muff.
[09:54.780 --> 09:57.460]  Oh no, I'm getting trapped in over here.
[09:57.900 --> 09:59.400]  I'm getting trapped in over here.
[09:59.580 --> 10:00.440]  It's making me nervous.
[10:00.660 --> 10:03.440]  I one time went to see them play at a club in Austin
[10:03.440 --> 10:05.180]  that's no longer around. It was called Electric
[10:05.180 --> 10:06.200]  Lounge, I think.
[10:06.780 --> 10:09.340]  I wasn't 21, and it was a 21 and over show
[10:09.340 --> 10:10.940]  and I didn't know that when I bought my ticket,
[10:11.080 --> 10:13.500]  so they wouldn't let me in, but they let me stand outside
[10:13.500 --> 10:14.900]  and listen when people were listening.
[10:15.600 --> 10:16.500]  That's so funny.
[10:16.680 --> 10:17.540]  That sucks.
[10:17.900 --> 10:19.200]  So that's how I heard them play.
[10:19.560 --> 10:20.920]  How considerate of them.
[10:22.580 --> 10:23.800]  Oh, we did it!
[10:24.260 --> 10:25.300]  Yeah, well you guys are fine.
[10:25.700 --> 10:26.060]  Move!
[10:27.880 --> 10:28.320]  Oh!
[10:29.540 --> 10:29.980]  Stinky!
[10:32.200 --> 10:34.560]  What would be the stinky rotten egg?
[10:34.840 --> 10:37.120]  If we have to do this, please don't do Tetris again.
[10:37.300 --> 10:39.000]  Andrew, can you turn up your game just a hair?
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.280]  Is it going to be Super Foss Breakout?
[10:41.300 --> 10:41.880]  Just a hair.
[10:42.620 --> 10:43.120]  Okay.
[10:43.440 --> 10:44.800]  I twisted it.
[10:45.000 --> 10:45.760]  Oh my god.
[10:47.100 --> 10:48.100]  Look out!
[10:48.720 --> 10:48.960]  No!
[10:51.720 --> 10:52.140]  Uh oh.
[10:53.820 --> 10:55.960]  I guess orange and blue are on a team?
[10:56.300 --> 10:57.180]  Yeah, why not?
[10:57.820 --> 10:58.700]  We have been for years.
[11:03.740 --> 11:04.740]  Oh shit.
[11:05.840 --> 11:06.720]  Uh oh, look out fellas!
[11:07.160 --> 11:07.620]  Oh god.
[11:09.040 --> 11:09.660]  Oh my god.
[11:09.660 --> 11:09.900]  On the outside.
[11:10.980 --> 11:12.620]  Oh my god!
[11:12.720 --> 11:14.880]  What happened?
[11:14.880 --> 11:16.720]  The exclamation point up there does that.
[11:17.280 --> 11:17.800]  Andrew!
[11:20.440 --> 11:22.140]  Andrew's not locked in on this one.
[11:22.580 --> 11:24.040]  Look at that.
[11:24.440 --> 11:25.280]  Look what I just did.
[11:25.560 --> 11:26.960]  Tell me I'm not locked in on this one.
[11:27.720 --> 11:29.880]  Andrew, you're not locked in on this one.
[11:29.900 --> 11:31.760]  There's five of us!
[11:32.100 --> 11:35.280]  Right, but I'm locked in on your zone!
[11:35.500 --> 11:35.840]  You!
[11:36.780 --> 11:37.140]  You!
[11:37.940 --> 11:39.880]  I don't know how you blame anyone else, but you!
[11:40.400 --> 11:42.200]  If we hit the other exclamation?
[11:42.720 --> 11:43.900]  Is it going to go double speed?
[11:44.680 --> 11:45.320]  Oh, that's a good question.
[11:45.820 --> 11:47.220]  Should we find out?
[11:47.240 --> 11:48.940]  I think you only hit one of them, the other one disappears.
[11:49.640 --> 11:50.360]  Oh shit.
[11:54.910 --> 11:55.270]  Shit.
[11:55.750 --> 11:56.170]  Oh bollocks.
[11:56.230 --> 11:57.550]  We lost a lot.
[11:58.170 --> 11:58.650]  Yeah, we did.
[12:00.050 --> 12:00.410]  Mine!
[12:03.710 --> 12:04.670]  Good call out.
[12:06.390 --> 12:07.050]  Andrew's right.
[12:07.130 --> 12:08.510]  Technically, we only need one.
[12:08.550 --> 12:10.490]  Oh, this is working out pretty well right now.
[12:10.750 --> 12:10.870]  This is a luxury.
[12:12.730 --> 12:13.570]  That's perfect.
[12:13.690 --> 12:15.950]  That's going to give us a setup.
[12:17.390 --> 12:18.350]  Someone's keyboard.
[12:19.250 --> 12:20.170]  What happened?
[12:20.590 --> 12:22.070]  It went around you!
[12:22.950 --> 12:23.710]  I lost!
[12:24.030 --> 12:25.890]  I got cracked under the pressure.
[12:28.330 --> 12:29.450]  It's too much.
[12:29.550 --> 12:30.050]  Let's give it a try.
[12:31.410 --> 12:33.350]  Why are any of the balls going
[12:33.350 --> 12:35.590]  any direction but up and down right now?
[12:35.650 --> 12:36.550]  That's a good question.
[12:38.190 --> 12:39.090]  I'd love to get an answer.
[12:39.090 --> 12:41.090]  I'm pretty sure I just watched Blue drop one.
[12:42.070 --> 12:43.330]  No, mine still haven't started.
[12:43.550 --> 12:45.930]  Yeah, he hasn't started his just in case.
[12:46.090 --> 12:46.270]  Whoops.
[12:47.130 --> 12:48.310]  Well, I guess he did.
[12:49.450 --> 12:50.210]  Now we're off.
[12:51.850 --> 12:52.550]  Double speed.
[12:53.330 --> 12:54.390]  We're looking good though.
[12:54.570 --> 12:56.010]  Oh shit. Oh balls.
[12:57.150 --> 12:57.790]  Uh oh.
[12:59.390 --> 13:00.750]  Oh my god.
[13:01.330 --> 13:02.510]  I touched it.
[13:03.170 --> 13:04.290]  Yeah, look at me.
[13:05.110 --> 13:07.310]  Alright, just keep an eye on it.
[13:07.370 --> 13:08.050]  Keep your head going.
[13:08.950 --> 13:09.990]  Andrew's locked in now.
[13:10.010 --> 13:10.870]  This is what I'm looking for.
[13:12.070 --> 13:14.270]  Alright, back to Andrew.
[13:14.630 --> 13:14.990]  Oh, floor.
[13:16.130 --> 13:18.470]  What happened? How did that happen?
[13:18.810 --> 13:20.450]  How did it go next to me
[13:20.450 --> 13:21.970]  and I hung onto it?
[13:22.410 --> 13:23.830]  It was in your hands.
[13:24.650 --> 13:25.870]  Somebody said, Geoff, you fool.
[13:26.050 --> 13:26.930]  What did I do wrong?
[13:26.930 --> 13:28.490]  Yeah, what the hell is that?
[13:29.310 --> 13:30.070]  What a load of bullshit.
[13:30.990 --> 13:31.790]  Nah, they're probably right.
[13:33.230 --> 13:34.570]  They're 100% right.
[13:35.450 --> 13:37.330]  Here we go, drifted just a little.
[13:37.590 --> 13:37.910]  Oh, well.
[13:38.330 --> 13:38.790]  No!
[13:40.210 --> 13:42.090]  That was two drops on you, Nick.
[13:42.110 --> 13:45.510]  That was not me, that was you.
[13:45.730 --> 13:46.870]  What are you talking about?
[13:47.050 --> 13:48.370]  Nick just dropped two as well.
[13:48.470 --> 13:49.950]  Big time.
[13:51.710 --> 13:52.170]  Maybe two.
[13:55.010 --> 13:56.030]  If I'm being honest.
[13:56.810 --> 13:58.510]  I'd like to be.
[13:58.550 --> 14:00.030]  About how I dropped that,
[14:00.090 --> 14:00.870]  that was me.
[14:01.050 --> 14:02.990]  See how we're honest about stuff?
[14:03.770 --> 14:05.070]  You really dodged that one.
[14:07.050 --> 14:08.070]  How are they not just
[14:08.070 --> 14:08.690]  going straight up against Gavin?
[14:08.690 --> 14:11.150]  Can we just climb up there and headbutt Gavin?
[14:11.570 --> 14:11.630]  Why?
[14:12.730 --> 14:14.290]  Can we just get up there?
[14:17.750 --> 14:18.190]  No.
[14:19.390 --> 14:20.130]  We can definitely
[14:20.130 --> 14:21.050]  build a tower, though.
[14:21.990 --> 14:23.310]  Can we get all the way up?
[14:23.310 --> 14:23.570]  No!
[14:25.450 --> 14:26.010]  No!
[14:28.590 --> 14:29.910]  How's it going over there, Nick?
[14:29.930 --> 14:30.330]  No!
[14:31.090 --> 14:32.490]  Really bad, dude.
[14:32.770 --> 14:35.230]  It's like a black hole for orange balls
[14:35.230 --> 14:36.730]  on the right side of the screen.
[14:36.850 --> 14:39.310]  Really bad.
[14:40.690 --> 14:42.050]  It's not good.
[14:42.970 --> 14:43.510]  Eric just
[14:43.510 --> 14:45.390]  stopped moving and then dropped another one.
[14:46.050 --> 14:47.050]  I'm not...
[14:47.050 --> 14:49.110]  I'm trying to watch it go up
[14:49.110 --> 14:50.490]  and it started going left and right.
[14:50.490 --> 14:51.670]  Okay, Gavin.
[14:51.950 --> 14:53.490]  Gavin, what was the last one on?
[14:53.770 --> 14:54.890]  You just watched it?
[14:55.190 --> 14:56.450]  I don't know why I'm even over there.
[14:56.810 --> 14:58.970]  Why are you over there?
[15:00.190 --> 15:01.330]  I don't know.
[15:03.710 --> 15:05.190]  Oh no, already?
[15:06.710 --> 15:07.030]  Alright.
[15:08.030 --> 15:08.830]  Do zones.
[15:10.230 --> 15:11.610]  Way to go, Gavin.
[15:11.730 --> 15:13.670]  Can I tell you that zone defense really works?
[15:14.430 --> 15:15.730]  That was Geoff's area.
[15:22.150 --> 15:23.670]  I just don't know why anybody moves at the beginning.
[15:23.810 --> 15:24.790]  You just go straight up and down.
[15:25.510 --> 15:28.510]  I tried to, but people move
[15:28.510 --> 15:29.610]  and shit gets in the way.
[15:30.070 --> 15:31.930]  Yeah, but if you can sneak one around the corner up there,
[15:31.970 --> 15:33.590]  it's gonna be easy.
[15:34.550 --> 15:36.070]  Why would you hit my corner?
[15:36.830 --> 15:37.150]  Gavin!
[15:37.730 --> 15:38.930]  That's not your ball!
[15:40.250 --> 15:40.830]  Oh god!
[15:41.670 --> 15:43.870]  Andrew, you gotta go a little left or a little right now.
[15:44.270 --> 15:45.310]  Yeah, otherwise we'll just do it all at once.
[15:45.310 --> 15:46.690]  You gotta send it somewhere else.
[15:47.290 --> 15:48.390]  Gavin, you suck.
[15:48.390 --> 15:48.970]  There you go.
[15:51.730 --> 15:54.010]  I got the raw end of the deal on that team
[15:54.010 --> 15:55.150]  however many years ago.
[15:56.290 --> 15:58.650]  I gotta say that this is Gavin's worst game.
[15:59.030 --> 16:00.190]  This is not good for Gavin.
[16:00.830 --> 16:02.390]  This is a bad one for Gavin.
[16:02.490 --> 16:03.390]  I'm not gonna get too involved.
[16:03.570 --> 16:04.590]  I'm gonna let other people...
[16:05.650 --> 16:07.990]  I think the problem is exactly that.
[16:08.470 --> 16:09.750]  Oh, you think I'm not involved enough?
[16:10.210 --> 16:11.970]  I think I'm ruining it by getting involved.
[16:12.770 --> 16:13.250]  Well...
[16:15.390 --> 16:16.650]  I'm just gonna stand here.
[16:16.750 --> 16:17.710]  There you go, just enough.
[16:17.950 --> 16:20.290]  Also, you don't have to jump, you can just sorta like...
[16:20.290 --> 16:20.630]  walk.
[16:21.510 --> 16:22.710]  What a catch, Andrew!
[16:24.230 --> 16:25.850]  Can someone get low?
[16:26.810 --> 16:27.910]  Who picked me up?
[16:28.410 --> 16:29.370]  Gavin, you're on me!
[16:29.610 --> 16:33.010]  Gavin, stop fucking stealing me!
[16:33.350 --> 16:33.610]  Damn.
[16:34.250 --> 16:35.390]  We tried so hard.
[16:35.670 --> 16:36.430]  That was me, Geoff.
[16:36.990 --> 16:37.470]  Okay.
[16:37.470 --> 16:37.730]  Okay.
[16:39.770 --> 16:40.750]  God damn it!
[16:41.050 --> 16:43.050]  We both went the wrong way.
[16:43.390 --> 16:44.530]  I'm gonna shit again.
[16:44.890 --> 16:46.730]  Why do I never shit before these streams?
[16:48.610 --> 16:49.730]  I got set at
[16:49.730 --> 16:51.710]  3.30pm Friday shit.
[16:52.890 --> 16:53.950]  Okay, just keep...
[16:53.950 --> 16:54.790]  keep it going.
[16:55.270 --> 16:57.410]  See, that straight up and down strategy I think is the way to go.
[16:57.450 --> 16:58.790]  That's a good way to go, I like it.
[17:00.290 --> 17:01.870]  Maybe try to go as low as you can.
[17:02.110 --> 17:02.950]  Oh, you're on me, Geoff!
[17:03.110 --> 17:03.530]  You're on me!
[17:03.530 --> 17:04.190]  Oh no!
[17:04.710 --> 17:05.950]  God damn!
[17:06.510 --> 17:09.350]  Now, I gotta blame the right side for being a mess,
[17:09.470 --> 17:11.210]  and I don't know exactly how.
[17:11.910 --> 17:12.470]  It's Nick!
[17:13.170 --> 17:14.830]  He keeps thieving me!
[17:15.010 --> 17:16.370]  You step on me!
[17:17.570 --> 17:18.330]  Save it?
[17:18.950 --> 17:19.950]  Yeah, we got it.
[17:20.630 --> 17:23.550]  You're stealing me like I'm a lawnmower in somebody's front yard!
[17:24.030 --> 17:25.110]  You guys are...
[17:25.110 --> 17:27.470]  That right side, look at the construction
[17:27.470 --> 17:29.410]  or destruction that we have lately.
[17:29.830 --> 17:32.030]  Look at the left side.
[17:32.030 --> 17:32.910]  Look at the right side.
[17:33.050 --> 17:35.650]  Look at the drop ball between green and blue there.
[17:36.430 --> 17:36.870]  Glue?
[17:38.730 --> 17:39.670]  It's green and blue.
[17:42.970 --> 17:44.350]  I'm just gonna stay over here.
[17:45.350 --> 17:47.350]  Just stay out from under me.
[17:47.370 --> 17:48.730]  Yeah, I'm just gonna stay over here.
[17:49.550 --> 17:51.410]  You keep fucking picking me up.
[17:51.550 --> 17:54.590]  Well, it's not so much being picked up as it's landed on.
[17:54.950 --> 17:55.590]  Oh, here we go.
[17:55.930 --> 17:57.070]  God damn it, Gavin!
[17:57.150 --> 17:58.370]  Why are you picking me up?
[17:58.370 --> 17:59.330]  I didn't pick you up!
[17:59.390 --> 18:01.150]  Stay out of your side of the goddamn door!
[18:01.370 --> 18:04.330]  There's no reason for you to go to the right of the door ever, motherfucker!
[18:05.850 --> 18:06.930]  Alright, last one.
[18:07.570 --> 18:08.490]  Alright, we're gonna go ahead
[18:08.490 --> 18:10.610]  and have a look at how the left side
[18:10.610 --> 18:12.270]  and the right side have really broken down here.
[18:13.330 --> 18:14.270]  I mean, just look.
[18:14.750 --> 18:15.830]  Just have a look.
[18:15.870 --> 18:18.530]  It has a lot to do with Gavin taking the right side
[18:18.530 --> 18:19.810]  away from the right side.
[18:20.110 --> 18:21.530]  Giving us free rides.
[18:22.370 --> 18:24.170]  Andrew, Andrew, that's a tough play.
[18:24.270 --> 18:25.010]  That's a tough play.
[18:25.010 --> 18:25.250]  That was me.
[18:25.430 --> 18:27.670]  I also think that we're jumping too much.
[18:28.050 --> 18:29.570]  What the hell happened?
[18:30.170 --> 18:32.730]  I will say, he keeps saying
[18:32.730 --> 18:34.930]  quit, jump straight up and down.
[18:34.970 --> 18:36.850]  He keeps saying stop picking me up,
[18:36.970 --> 18:39.190]  but you can't pick people up in the game.
[18:39.630 --> 18:40.870]  All I do is jump
[18:40.870 --> 18:42.310]  straight up and down.
[18:42.470 --> 18:43.770]  I don't move left or right.
[18:45.070 --> 18:47.230]  Gavin, you're not on your side of the door!
[18:47.990 --> 18:50.950]  Look at the right side!
[18:51.130 --> 18:52.090]  Look at the right side!
[18:52.090 --> 18:54.630]  Am I meant to be on the right of the door?
[18:56.210 --> 18:58.290]  Andrew, it robbed it from you.
[18:58.510 --> 18:59.430]  That was terrible.
[19:04.690 --> 19:06.770]  There were two that hit you on the side?
[19:06.850 --> 19:07.410]  I don't know, man.
[19:07.890 --> 19:09.230]  I think we just need to stop jumping
[19:09.230 --> 19:11.370]  after we get this first ball.
[19:11.690 --> 19:13.030]  I'm the door guard.
[19:14.210 --> 19:15.870]  There's a door guard?
[19:15.990 --> 19:17.630]  There's a fucking roof above you, dude.
[19:17.670 --> 19:18.290]  What are you guarding?
[19:18.710 --> 19:19.810]  The door area.
[19:20.950 --> 19:22.350]  Just have a look at the left side
[19:22.350 --> 19:23.290]  and have a look at the right side.
[19:23.450 --> 19:27.330]  The middle is the problem right now.
[19:27.690 --> 19:28.590]  Have a look at that middle.
[19:28.890 --> 19:30.630]  Nick, you're tearing it up right now.
[19:30.970 --> 19:32.490]  Nick, shut up! You're doing great!
[19:34.150 --> 19:35.990]  What if we just send one
[19:37.630 --> 19:38.490]  at a time?
[19:38.930 --> 19:40.450]  I hate to say it, but I like your idea.
[19:41.290 --> 19:42.090]  Nice shot, Geoff.
[19:42.390 --> 19:43.210]  Oh, I suck.
[19:44.950 --> 19:45.630]  Pyramid up!
[19:46.190 --> 19:46.630]  Yeah!
[19:48.930 --> 19:49.210]  Redeem myself.
[19:50.030 --> 19:51.430]  Imagine if we had a total pool.
[19:51.790 --> 19:52.150]  This is gonna work.
[19:52.790 --> 19:53.870]  It's gonna work.
[19:54.550 --> 19:59.510]  Oh, we got this.
[19:59.550 --> 20:00.430]  Just finish it, Sean.
[20:00.790 --> 20:01.230]  Come on!
[20:04.130 --> 20:04.570]  Yeah!
[20:05.410 --> 20:06.210]  Get the key!
[20:06.710 --> 20:08.090]  It's still in the door!
[20:08.310 --> 20:09.390]  Get out of the way!
[20:10.850 --> 20:12.290]  Let me out!
[20:12.290 --> 20:13.410]  Let me out of this hellhole!
[20:14.370 --> 20:15.170]  Never again!
[20:15.670 --> 20:16.070]  Perfect.
[20:17.030 --> 20:18.270]  VIP, me!
[20:21.590 --> 20:22.310]  Nailed it.
[20:22.710 --> 20:24.170]  Oh, shit. I hate these games.
[20:25.510 --> 20:26.470]  Get us out of here!
[20:26.770 --> 20:27.290]  Yeah, what are you doing?
[20:27.490 --> 20:28.970]  Get out. Leave, please.
[20:30.290 --> 20:30.690]  Ballpark.
[20:32.490 --> 20:34.310]  Gavin was worried about this going too quickly.
[20:36.030 --> 20:36.430]  What?
[20:36.530 --> 20:38.350]  What are we supposed to do?
[20:38.410 --> 20:39.590]  We need to make it hit the key.
[20:39.590 --> 20:40.830]  Get off of me!
[20:41.210 --> 20:43.090]  Everyone dodge it. Stop jumping on it.
[20:43.550 --> 20:45.270]  Stop jumping into it.
[20:46.150 --> 20:47.710]  Stop jumping into it.
[20:49.230 --> 20:50.530]  Stop jumping into it.
[20:52.170 --> 20:52.410]  Nice.
[20:52.670 --> 20:54.250]  A few more of those.
[20:54.550 --> 20:55.030]  Oh, shit.
[20:57.250 --> 20:57.650]  One more.
[20:59.270 --> 21:01.450]  Get off of me, VIP shit!
[21:02.510 --> 21:03.670]  Don't jump under me.
[21:05.250 --> 21:06.630]  First off, I'm purple.
[21:06.630 --> 21:08.650]  Why are you so close to the damn thing?
[21:08.830 --> 21:09.710]  Get over here, you fools.
[21:11.350 --> 21:12.530]  Why? To be near you?
[21:13.370 --> 21:15.010]  Well, you have more time to react.
[21:16.270 --> 21:16.570]  Sure.
[21:19.350 --> 21:19.750]  Fools.
[21:24.570 --> 21:27.870]  That is the laugh of someone who's going to be a problem.
[21:28.150 --> 21:28.910]  I'm a big fan.
[21:29.030 --> 21:30.490]  I love when the chat is wrong.
[21:30.670 --> 21:31.330]  Someone in the chat.
[21:32.570 --> 21:34.150]  Stack on top of one another.
[21:34.150 --> 21:36.250]  How would that solve the problem?
[21:36.690 --> 21:37.450]  How on earth would we do that?
[21:38.130 --> 21:38.650]  What's this do?
[21:40.110 --> 21:41.230]  Holy shit.
[21:41.610 --> 21:43.110]  It's balance the game.
[21:43.410 --> 21:46.290]  Alright, get off this.
[21:53.210 --> 21:54.330]  Your side.
[21:56.730 --> 21:57.950]  Green, come over here.
[21:58.110 --> 21:58.630]  Green, come over here.
[22:00.390 --> 22:01.230]  I'm on the right.
[22:02.170 --> 22:03.050]  You're too far.
[22:03.230 --> 22:04.070]  I got it.
[22:06.270 --> 22:06.990]  Hop up.
[22:07.150 --> 22:07.890]  Quicker, quicker than that.
[22:12.670 --> 22:13.930]  You're on it just a little bit, Nick.
[22:15.910 --> 22:17.330]  Get ready to double stack.
[22:19.990 --> 22:20.350]  Now.
[22:21.030 --> 22:21.390]  Nice.
[22:22.070 --> 22:22.610]  Blue, go.
[22:24.610 --> 22:25.790]  What do you mean me go?
[22:28.350 --> 22:29.490]  I thought we had it.
[22:29.490 --> 22:29.770]  Alright.
[22:30.930 --> 22:32.850]  And then Geoff, come with me.
[22:32.850 --> 22:35.110]  It's fine, it's fine.
[22:35.190 --> 22:35.750]  Jump, jump.
[22:36.070 --> 22:38.750]  Go, go, go.
[22:39.850 --> 22:40.030]  Yeah.
[22:41.110 --> 22:42.210]  We did it.
[22:45.290 --> 22:46.970]  That was the easiest one yet.
[22:47.150 --> 22:48.530]  I smell like rotten eggs.
[22:51.970 --> 22:53.670]  That is baby stuff.
[22:53.950 --> 22:56.470]  That one is the easiest one we've done to this point.
[22:58.410 --> 22:58.930]  No!
[23:02.930 --> 23:03.730]  Oh, no.
[23:06.050 --> 23:06.810]  Oh, no.
[23:08.470 --> 23:10.250]  They can hit the ground,
[23:10.410 --> 23:11.730]  but not the orange ground.
[23:12.450 --> 23:13.690]  We just have to leave.
[23:14.210 --> 23:16.550]  We don't have to leave. There's going to be more.
[23:19.190 --> 23:20.750]  We don't have to clear everything.
[23:21.130 --> 23:23.290]  Guys, we have to protect the balls.
[23:23.730 --> 23:24.090]  There you go.
[23:24.090 --> 23:24.950]  Don't hit it, Red.
[23:25.410 --> 23:27.330]  I didn't hit it.
[23:27.530 --> 23:28.610]  We got it stuck between us.
[23:29.170 --> 23:29.610]  There you go.
[23:31.550 --> 23:32.810]  There we go.
[23:34.030 --> 23:35.350]  Where are you going, Blue?
[23:36.150 --> 23:37.510]  I'm just keeping balls alive.
[23:37.690 --> 23:38.590]  I'm keeping balls in the game.
[23:40.270 --> 23:41.230]  Oh, no.
[23:43.510 --> 23:44.130]  Keep that one away.
[23:46.050 --> 23:47.210]  Keep it alive.
[23:47.730 --> 23:48.370]  There you go.
[23:48.730 --> 23:49.210]  Blue!
[23:53.370 --> 23:54.270]  We're good.
[23:54.850 --> 23:55.710]  We're so close.
[23:57.570 --> 23:58.670]  We're good. Everyone shut up.
[23:58.930 --> 23:59.310]  Come right.
[24:00.870 --> 24:01.630]  Let's leave.
[24:03.710 --> 24:05.270]  Just make room for Red.
[24:05.990 --> 24:08.630]  Make room for Key.
[24:08.850 --> 24:09.390]  Make room for Key.
[24:09.630 --> 24:10.450]  There we go.
[24:11.310 --> 24:13.070]  Oh, that ball's still alive.
[24:13.350 --> 24:14.770]  Make room for Key.
[24:15.130 --> 24:16.250]  Make room for Key.
[24:16.250 --> 24:17.730]  These fucking idiots.
[24:17.970 --> 24:18.730]  Make room for Key.
[24:20.390 --> 24:21.710]  As opposed to what?
[24:22.350 --> 24:23.730]  Getting out of the way.
[24:23.950 --> 24:24.950]  What? Where?
[24:26.310 --> 24:27.370]  It's the same thing.
[24:27.510 --> 24:30.350]  All I know is green smells like rotten eggs.
[24:30.530 --> 24:31.670]  Maybe you should think about that.
[24:31.930 --> 24:33.430]  It's what a winner smells like, baby.
[24:34.230 --> 24:36.570]  I believe the winner is the one who walked through the door before.
[24:36.750 --> 24:37.390]  Oh, we gotta...
[24:38.570 --> 24:39.830]  Let's see. How's the bounce?
[24:40.150 --> 24:40.970]  We gotta bring the ball.
[24:43.070 --> 24:44.070]  Oh, dear.
[24:44.070 --> 24:45.510]  Okay, so spread out.
[24:45.810 --> 24:46.670]  So we're on TikTok.
[24:47.710 --> 24:48.610]  Oh, okay. Here.
[24:49.790 --> 24:50.910]  I'll try to hit it early.
[24:52.070 --> 24:52.690]  You have to jump.
[24:53.130 --> 24:53.570]  Got it.
[24:57.810 --> 24:58.070]  Okay.
[25:01.370 --> 25:03.010]  I'm never gonna touch it.
[25:07.660 --> 25:08.540]  I jumped.
[25:12.140 --> 25:13.860]  This is gonna be a netcode thing.
[25:14.940 --> 25:15.520]  Oh, God.
[25:18.960 --> 25:20.500]  The keyboard sound.
[25:20.960 --> 25:21.780]  The keyboard.
[25:22.680 --> 25:24.920]  I'm laughing. I'm laughing too hard
[25:24.920 --> 25:26.360]  to time this fucking joke.
[25:29.840 --> 25:32.520]  I'm never gonna get it.
[25:32.540 --> 25:33.680]  Oh, God. Well, that's me.
[25:33.700 --> 25:34.660]  What are you doing?
[25:39.500 --> 25:44.080]  I'm hitting it on my screen.
[25:45.540 --> 25:46.500]  You go.
[25:46.720 --> 25:47.700]  Let's swap, Gavin.
[25:48.200 --> 25:50.240]  Let's get all the Texas people to the right.
[25:50.560 --> 25:52.460]  Ah, my stomach.
[25:53.700 --> 25:54.320]  Oh, God.
[25:54.840 --> 25:55.280]  Oh, no.
[25:56.500 --> 25:57.920]  When it gets that deep
[25:57.920 --> 25:59.440]  and he doesn't do it, it's so funny.
[26:00.320 --> 26:01.380]  Okay, that's me.
[26:02.520 --> 26:03.380]  Oh, God.
[26:03.540 --> 26:04.460]  Oh, come on.
[26:12.020 --> 26:14.280]  I'm telling you what I'm seeing and what you're seeing
[26:14.280 --> 26:15.700]  are not the same thing.
[26:20.680 --> 26:22.380]  Sorry, that's me.
[26:28.340 --> 26:29.680]  Why don't you go to the front?
[26:30.000 --> 26:30.780]  Andrew, at the beginning.
[26:30.780 --> 26:32.080]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[26:32.720 --> 26:34.940]  Alright, let's... I'll go where he is.
[26:36.560 --> 26:37.820]  Alright, here we go.
[26:39.260 --> 26:40.760]  Move to the right!
[26:41.600 --> 26:42.320]  He's not...
[26:42.320 --> 26:44.080]  That was it. That was it, briefly.
[26:44.820 --> 26:47.080]  Yes. Okay, that's me.
[26:51.300 --> 26:51.560]  Okay.
[26:53.900 --> 26:56.220]  Nick's filling the Andrew slot a bit too well.
[26:58.280 --> 26:58.800]  Yeah!
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.120]  Andrew, buddy, I think you did great.
[27:04.800 --> 27:05.980]  Oh, man.
[27:07.560 --> 27:08.420]  That was...
[27:08.420 --> 27:09.980]  I was... I have, like, tears in my...
[27:09.980 --> 27:11.300]  My contacts are, like, coming out.
[27:11.360 --> 27:12.700]  I was laughing so hard.
[27:13.060 --> 27:14.200]  Every time...
[27:15.020 --> 27:18.480]  Oh, fuck.
[27:21.720 --> 27:22.700]  It was so funny.
[27:22.700 --> 27:23.160]  That was...
[27:23.740 --> 27:24.600]  Oh, fuck.
[27:27.240 --> 27:28.460]  It's the netcode!
[27:28.860 --> 27:29.700]  It's the netcode thing!
[27:31.120 --> 27:32.260]  What the fuck?
[27:32.540 --> 27:33.140]  Where am I?
[27:33.220 --> 27:33.920]  Hit the two buttons.
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.880]  Okay, blue and red, go for it.
[27:37.400 --> 27:38.220]  Hit the two buttons.
[27:40.200 --> 27:40.560]  Okay.
[27:41.600 --> 27:42.080]  Blue.
[27:42.300 --> 27:43.080]  Do we have to birth people?
[27:45.800 --> 27:46.520]  There we go.
[27:47.320 --> 27:49.920]  I think we're doing duo teamwork stuff.
[27:50.820 --> 27:51.140]  Whoa!
[27:52.900 --> 27:53.540]  Holy shit.
[27:53.700 --> 27:55.760]  Okay, I'll hold it here. I'll hold it here, Nick.
[27:56.100 --> 27:57.540]  You got it. Okay, hang on. Wait, wait, wait.
[27:57.840 --> 27:59.300]  Let's see what the other one's doing, maybe.
[27:59.380 --> 28:00.420]  Let's see what the second one does.
[28:01.320 --> 28:03.500]  Okay, so that's the next one I gotta hit. Okay, you're good.
[28:03.640 --> 28:04.900]  I got you. Ready?
[28:06.100 --> 28:07.200]  Everyone, shut up.
[28:07.320 --> 28:09.100]  Here we go. On one. Ready?
[28:09.220 --> 28:10.580]  Three, two, one.
[28:11.100 --> 28:12.160]  Why would you count?
[28:14.480 --> 28:15.800]  Three, two, one.
[28:16.000 --> 28:16.240]  Four.
[28:16.240 --> 28:18.600]  Did not know where it was going.
[28:18.700 --> 28:19.240]  That's fine.
[28:19.400 --> 28:21.820]  No, you're good.
[28:22.220 --> 28:24.540]  Ready? Three, two, one.
[28:25.200 --> 28:25.960]  Okay, shut up.
[28:26.280 --> 28:28.800]  When you say one, you gotta wait a second
[28:28.800 --> 28:30.600]  because the delay between us...
[28:30.600 --> 28:31.500]  Oh, is there a delay? Okay.
[28:32.880 --> 28:34.080]  Say half after one.
[28:34.100 --> 28:35.860]  So you say one and then zero.
[28:36.160 --> 28:37.720]  I'll jump on one, you do it zero.
[28:39.400 --> 28:40.820]  Three, two, one.
[28:42.100 --> 28:42.480]  There we go.
[28:42.500 --> 28:43.920]  You guys are taking a lot longer than we did.
[28:43.920 --> 28:44.660]  There we go.
[28:46.220 --> 28:48.300]  Easy. Nick, Nick, that was simple.
[28:48.620 --> 28:49.100]  Yeah, GG.
[28:49.380 --> 28:51.280]  There you go. Alright, orange and red, go ahead.
[28:52.340 --> 28:53.060]  Oh, God.
[28:53.440 --> 28:55.420]  Just don't die so we have to do it all over again, right?
[28:56.680 --> 28:57.400]  Oh, wait, no.
[28:57.760 --> 28:59.620]  No! Do not take us back!
[29:02.180 --> 29:04.920]  I mean, just don't die so we have to do it all over again, right?
[29:24.740 --> 29:25.700]  Alright, here you go.
[29:26.980 --> 29:27.700]  Oh, that...
[29:27.700 --> 29:28.720]  We can do two at the same time.
[29:28.900 --> 29:31.320]  That's what I was saying, but I got told to shut up.
[29:31.340 --> 29:32.280]  I said it as well.
[29:32.720 --> 29:35.540]  You guys were just counting and saying two, one.
[29:35.800 --> 29:38.620]  After you refused to listen to our good advice,
[29:38.780 --> 29:39.460]  we were annoying.
[29:39.820 --> 29:40.620]  Jump, stay.
[29:42.180 --> 29:43.640]  Oh, easy. You guys got it.
[29:43.860 --> 29:45.440]  That was way easier than the countdown.
[29:45.840 --> 29:46.580]  Do it, do it, do it.
[29:46.660 --> 29:48.700]  Now this probably involves death, so don't mess it up.
[29:49.160 --> 29:50.320]  Oh, I'm back. Oh, God.
[29:50.620 --> 29:52.180]  How do we want to do this, Gavin?
[29:53.100 --> 29:54.560]  Run, jump, over, and go.
[29:54.740 --> 29:55.100]  With the key.
[29:55.280 --> 29:56.280]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[29:57.760 --> 29:59.920]  You jump first, just use the middle one.
[30:00.020 --> 30:01.340]  I'm going to use the bottom two and get up.
[30:03.660 --> 30:04.240]  Like that.
[30:04.400 --> 30:04.800]  Nice.
[30:05.740 --> 30:06.400]  What the?
[30:07.340 --> 30:08.380]  It's Biggie Smallie.
[30:09.260 --> 30:10.140]  It's you, Geoff.
[30:11.860 --> 30:13.880]  I was excited about watching.
[30:14.060 --> 30:15.360]  I know, you were like, Biggie Smallie.
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.960]  And then you stood there.
[30:18.780 --> 30:19.060]  Oh.
[30:19.060 --> 30:19.100]  Oh.
[30:21.660 --> 30:22.740]  Might be the wrong order.
[30:23.520 --> 30:24.220]  You gotta get bigger.
[30:26.080 --> 30:26.840]  I'll get bigger.
[30:28.680 --> 30:30.480]  And then I think you stand on both buttons.
[30:32.940 --> 30:34.640]  And then he can go and step on that.
[30:35.800 --> 30:36.900]  Now you get small.
[30:40.040 --> 30:40.260]  Oh.
[30:41.120 --> 30:43.340]  You thought that was the right one.
[30:44.940 --> 30:46.860]  Go stand on the button, see what it does.
[30:48.340 --> 30:49.160]  There you go.
[30:50.800 --> 30:51.760]  You have to get small.
[30:51.840 --> 30:53.060]  I think you gotta get small, yeah.
[30:53.960 --> 30:54.860]  And then Andrew has to
[30:55.640 --> 30:56.860]  step on that button to...
[30:58.740 --> 30:58.960]  Uh.
[31:00.940 --> 31:03.480]  Yeah, give it a...
[31:03.480 --> 31:04.360]  It has to be smaller.
[31:04.600 --> 31:05.380]  Yeah, I think so.
[31:06.120 --> 31:07.700]  But I have to be big enough to hit both buttons.
[31:07.700 --> 31:09.920]  Yeah, I was going to say, you have to be big enough to hit both buttons, right?
[31:10.060 --> 31:11.420]  No, because Andrew's got the steps.
[31:11.440 --> 31:12.880]  So all he has to do is stand there.
[31:13.260 --> 31:14.980]  You only need to get the right one.
[31:14.980 --> 31:16.240]  Goes all the way up.
[31:16.440 --> 31:17.100]  Now go.
[31:19.020 --> 31:20.920]  There. I see. I thought it was both of them.
[31:21.020 --> 31:22.300]  I see. I did too.
[31:24.940 --> 31:25.340]  Amazing.
[31:26.940 --> 31:28.640]  Get off the button, Andrew.
[31:28.880 --> 31:30.980]  Oh my god. No, that's what he needed to do.
[31:31.580 --> 31:33.100]  It makes me feel like, okay,
[31:33.220 --> 31:34.320]  it's not just us.
[31:35.020 --> 31:35.540]  Hop up, son.
[31:36.560 --> 31:37.800]  I'll jump, you jump, I'll jump.
[31:37.800 --> 31:38.600]  What?
[31:41.640 --> 31:43.780]  I placed my hand upon your hip.
[31:44.080 --> 31:45.260]  When I dip, you dip, we dip.
[31:45.660 --> 31:47.160]  And now, what did that do?
[31:47.780 --> 31:47.960]  Oh.
[31:49.440 --> 31:50.820]  What the fuck?
[31:51.120 --> 31:52.900]  I don't know. Why did that work?
[31:54.400 --> 31:55.060]  What do you think?
[31:55.060 --> 31:56.480]  You gotta do a Yoshi jump.
[31:57.200 --> 31:58.980]  I'll sacrifice myself, you follow me.
[31:59.020 --> 31:59.600]  Wait, hang on.
[32:00.660 --> 32:03.360]  Can you jump?
[32:04.140 --> 32:04.640]  No, I can't.
[32:06.100 --> 32:07.020]  So, I'm gonna...
[32:07.020 --> 32:08.560]  But if you run off, can you jump?
[32:10.560 --> 32:11.920]  Okay, one more time. We got it.
[32:12.940 --> 32:14.600]  Sorry, I got excited.
[32:14.860 --> 32:15.300]  I got excited.
[32:15.500 --> 32:15.860]  Yeah!
[32:18.840 --> 32:25.880]  Oh, you guys have to double jump, I think.
[32:26.020 --> 32:27.080]  Like, someone has to jump on someone.
[32:28.140 --> 32:28.660]  There you go.
[32:29.780 --> 32:30.200]  Jump, Geoff.
[32:30.480 --> 32:32.640]  You got this, Geoff.
[32:32.920 --> 32:35.840]  I can hear Geoff's keyboard, so I think
[32:35.840 --> 32:38.420]  he's trying to time it, but he shouldn't be.
[32:38.580 --> 32:40.080]  He should just be going for it, right?
[32:40.480 --> 32:41.740]  I'm just slamming it.
[32:43.440 --> 32:44.220]  Oh, okay.
[32:44.420 --> 32:45.840]  Then the person needs to jump off
[32:45.840 --> 32:47.520]  to him, and then jump off of that.
[32:47.940 --> 32:49.060]  Then he needs my head.
[32:49.680 --> 32:51.160]  Yeah, we'll just both go over there.
[32:53.260 --> 32:54.320]  Yeah, you go over there.
[32:55.520 --> 32:56.160]  No, I'll go over here.
[32:56.220 --> 32:57.600]  Jump on my head, and then get over.
[32:57.740 --> 32:59.760]  Yeah! Nicely done.
[33:00.200 --> 33:00.920]  Alright, me and you, Gavin.
[33:01.420 --> 33:02.060]  Let's do this.
[33:03.360 --> 33:03.840]  Uh...
[33:03.840 --> 33:06.340]  What is...
[33:06.340 --> 33:06.840]  Oh.
[33:08.480 --> 33:08.960]  Oh.
[33:09.060 --> 33:09.500]  Oh.
[33:14.130 --> 33:15.090]  Oh my god.
[33:17.230 --> 33:18.110]  So it's...
[33:18.110 --> 33:20.090]  We just have to hit up, don't...
[33:20.090 --> 33:21.650]  So we can only jump on up.
[33:22.210 --> 33:24.590]  Yep. But, like, there's no pattern
[33:24.590 --> 33:25.010]  to it?
[33:28.930 --> 33:29.410]  Hey!
[33:31.730 --> 33:32.470]  There you go.
[33:32.690 --> 33:32.870]  Nice!
[33:33.350 --> 33:34.670]  I don't know why I was doing that.
[33:34.730 --> 33:36.790]  There was no pattern. You just had to, like, guess it
[33:36.790 --> 33:37.870]  when the arrow was coming.
[33:39.310 --> 33:40.730]  What a load of...
[33:40.730 --> 33:41.930]  Yeah, that was really bizarre.
[33:42.370 --> 33:43.670]  There also didn't need to be two of us there.
[33:44.510 --> 33:46.190]  Nah, it was just me by myself, I guess.
[33:46.570 --> 33:47.970]  Oh, hell yeah. Let's go.
[33:48.430 --> 33:51.230]  Oh, this is...
[33:51.230 --> 33:51.930]  Oh, dear.
[33:54.310 --> 33:55.010]  Green, go.
[33:55.710 --> 33:56.590]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[33:56.690 --> 33:57.830]  I got very confused.
[33:58.550 --> 34:00.070]  You have to jump on the platform to the left.
[34:00.070 --> 34:01.130]  Yeah, there you go.
[34:02.990 --> 34:04.130]  This is the wrong way, right, Andrew?
[34:04.250 --> 34:05.610]  Yeah, we gotta go up, I think.
[34:06.970 --> 34:07.530]  Oh, nice.
[34:07.590 --> 34:08.190]  There's nowhere to go.
[34:10.450 --> 34:12.110]  I'm jumping all...
[34:12.110 --> 34:13.010]  No, nothing.
[34:14.390 --> 34:15.650]  Oh! Oh!
[34:18.530 --> 34:19.450]  Are we going up?
[34:19.870 --> 34:20.530]  Oh, it's a lift.
[34:22.350 --> 34:23.170]  Oh, stay on it.
[34:26.250 --> 34:26.950]  Oh, I see.
[34:26.950 --> 34:28.790]  All right, now it's these idiots.
[34:32.670 --> 34:33.050]  Well...
[34:33.050 --> 34:34.050]  Almost, Geoff.
[34:35.510 --> 34:36.710]  Yeah, what's up? You wanna come?
[34:37.050 --> 34:37.870]  Yeah, I would like to.
[34:38.690 --> 34:40.690]  Will you stand with me for a second? That sounded weird.
[34:40.890 --> 34:42.610]  Hold on, let's not move. I'll walk.
[34:43.190 --> 34:43.310]  Okay.
[34:45.250 --> 34:46.010]  Good job.
[34:46.190 --> 34:46.910]  Jump on me.
[34:47.490 --> 34:50.870]  Oh, we're pushing this together.
[34:51.490 --> 34:52.010]  There we go.
[34:52.210 --> 34:53.750]  We did it. Nice job, Geoff.
[34:53.750 --> 34:54.950]  Thanks, man.
[34:55.770 --> 34:56.850]  Oh, God.
[34:57.650 --> 34:58.510]  That was cool.
[34:58.810 --> 35:00.670]  Wow, that was...
[35:00.670 --> 35:02.410]  That's exactly what I thought it looked like.
[35:02.530 --> 35:02.730]  Yeah.
[35:06.450 --> 35:07.130]  Uh-oh.
[35:08.290 --> 35:09.290]  This game's...
[35:09.290 --> 35:10.430]  for babies.
[35:11.030 --> 35:11.930]  Oh, my God.
[35:12.570 --> 35:13.090]  What?
[35:14.690 --> 35:15.850]  All right, don't go right.
[35:20.790 --> 35:21.730]  Jump on my head.
[35:21.730 --> 35:21.770]  What?
[35:24.350 --> 35:25.950]  Here, could you double-jump me a little bit
[35:25.950 --> 35:26.730]  to the right?
[35:27.650 --> 35:27.970]  Yeah.
[35:29.530 --> 35:31.110]  Okay, no, I think we have to go right.
[35:31.190 --> 35:32.350]  I think we just gotta clear a jump.
[35:36.350 --> 35:36.990]  That was...
[35:36.990 --> 35:37.990]  That was a good try.
[35:40.990 --> 35:41.310]  What?
[35:45.610 --> 35:46.250]  Wait, wait, wait.
[35:46.910 --> 35:47.930]  Okay, jump on my head.
[35:49.490 --> 35:51.250]  And then hold...
[35:51.250 --> 35:51.370]  Yeah!
[35:53.430 --> 35:54.290]  But now what?
[35:55.990 --> 35:56.410]  Uh...
[35:56.410 --> 35:56.710]  Oh, yeah.
[35:57.370 --> 35:57.790]  Whoa!
[36:02.410 --> 36:03.730]  Yeah, there's a thing to the left.
[36:04.250 --> 36:04.390]  Yeah.
[36:07.350 --> 36:07.770]  Oh.
[36:07.970 --> 36:08.030]  Okay.
[36:10.090 --> 36:11.530]  Can you both push it?
[36:11.910 --> 36:12.450]  Oh, is it a push?
[36:12.730 --> 36:14.170]  Yeah, there you go.
[36:14.170 --> 36:14.690]  Nice.
[36:15.070 --> 36:17.370]  Wow, and then here we go.
[36:18.990 --> 36:19.470]  Uh...
[36:19.470 --> 36:21.110]  And then I'll just go right down here.
[36:22.290 --> 36:23.290]  Can we both push?
[36:23.450 --> 36:23.990]  There we go.
[36:25.750 --> 36:27.770]  And then we just go back up.
[36:29.930 --> 36:30.410]  Go...
[36:30.410 --> 36:32.790]  Go right when you can, I guess?
[36:33.490 --> 36:33.630]  Yeah.
[36:33.630 --> 36:35.890]  Wait, no, we have to go up.
[36:38.270 --> 36:39.210]  How do we go up?
[36:39.510 --> 36:41.750]  Maybe you need...
[36:42.190 --> 36:44.290]  Jump on me right here, and you can get up on there.
[36:46.430 --> 36:47.590]  Oh, that could...
[36:47.590 --> 36:48.770]  Well, no, it's too high.
[36:49.590 --> 36:50.810]  Oh, wait, is there something here?
[36:52.930 --> 36:54.050]  I think there's something here,
[36:54.110 --> 36:55.570]  but I can't get...
[36:56.850 --> 36:57.210]  Nope.
[37:00.090 --> 37:02.050]  That drops us down if we're both on it.
[37:02.170 --> 37:02.490]  Right.
[37:03.250 --> 37:04.930]  Is there an up anywhere? No.
[37:05.610 --> 37:06.890]  No, it doesn't seem like it.
[37:07.710 --> 37:09.690]  Oh, wait, but if you're both standing right here,
[37:09.690 --> 37:10.470]  you'd be able to jump.
[37:10.590 --> 37:14.370]  Because earlier, you were trying to jump from a lower platform.
[37:14.550 --> 37:15.170]  Let's try it from here.
[37:16.310 --> 37:16.690]  Oh, yeah.
[37:17.090 --> 37:17.670]  There you go.
[37:19.590 --> 37:21.030]  I didn't know that was going up.
[37:21.270 --> 37:21.410]  I see.
[37:25.900 --> 37:27.120]  And I think...
[37:27.120 --> 37:28.120]  He blocked me.
[37:28.860 --> 37:29.660]  Yeah, sorry about that.
[37:30.760 --> 37:31.700]  I blocked myself.
[37:33.400 --> 37:34.920]  Well, don't stand on each other.
[37:35.860 --> 37:37.260]  Oh, my God.
[37:37.440 --> 37:39.140]  The solution would be to be next to each other, right?
[37:40.040 --> 37:41.620]  I think we've got to be on top of each other.
[37:41.860 --> 37:42.080]  Yeah.
[37:42.160 --> 37:43.260]  It's small.
[37:45.020 --> 37:47.100]  It's not going high enough for both of you to get on it.
[37:47.440 --> 37:49.440]  Let's just ride it all the way up.
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.860]  As high as it'll let us go.
[37:54.200 --> 37:54.680]  There you go.
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.080]  Now go, Andrew, and then go, Gavin.
[37:58.140 --> 38:02.480]  Oh, so there is...
[38:02.480 --> 38:04.540]  So there's blank ones.
[38:04.760 --> 38:07.740]  So maybe it's just a little hoppy skip at the end.
[38:07.740 --> 38:08.200]  Okay, ready?
[38:08.840 --> 38:11.260]  Okay, and then go red.
[38:11.800 --> 38:12.260]  Red.
[38:12.920 --> 38:15.120]  And then the same gap again.
[38:15.760 --> 38:16.400]  Same gap.
[38:17.580 --> 38:18.800]  And then blue.
[38:19.040 --> 38:20.820]  And then I think probably the same gap again.
[38:21.060 --> 38:21.840]  Yeah, the penitent man.
[38:22.900 --> 38:23.680]  Why, Gavin?
[38:26.020 --> 38:27.920]  Well, red can figure this out.
[38:28.040 --> 38:28.640]  And red did.
[38:29.500 --> 38:31.260]  Right, but blue can't get back up there.
[38:31.680 --> 38:33.480]  No, I know, but we can at least make sure that...
[38:33.480 --> 38:33.880]  Hey!
[38:33.880 --> 38:34.200]  Hey!
[38:35.600 --> 38:36.280]  Oh, cool, we win.
[38:38.620 --> 38:39.100]  Okay.
[38:43.250 --> 38:44.710]  Wait, wait, wait.
[38:44.810 --> 38:44.970]  Okay.
[38:45.710 --> 38:47.290]  You can also walk, remember?
[38:47.410 --> 38:48.050]  You can walk through.
[38:49.570 --> 38:51.330]  I tried to walk, but I fell.
[38:51.950 --> 38:52.270]  You did?
[38:54.190 --> 38:54.370]  Huh.
[38:55.630 --> 38:56.110]  Interesting.
[38:57.990 --> 38:58.950]  No touchy.
[39:04.320 --> 39:04.800]  Okay.
[39:05.560 --> 39:06.040]  Ah!
[39:06.040 --> 39:07.960]  Ah, that's unfortunate.
[39:08.240 --> 39:09.560]  It's probably a netcode thing.
[39:10.280 --> 39:10.720]  Oh.
[39:12.580 --> 39:13.620]  That was me.
[39:14.720 --> 39:15.800]  I know it's netcode.
[39:20.100 --> 39:21.700]  Why isn't it...
[39:21.700 --> 39:22.740]  I mean, you're the one on the floor.
[39:23.380 --> 39:24.740]  Yeah, I don't know why it's not going up.
[39:25.480 --> 39:26.860]  You're probably not standing on it.
[39:28.160 --> 39:28.220]  Oh.
[39:29.560 --> 39:30.280]  Check this out.
[39:32.420 --> 39:33.660]  O is the funniest.
[39:34.540 --> 39:35.300]  There we go.
[39:36.580 --> 39:38.180]  Well, I like that you've given him
[39:38.180 --> 39:40.100]  no light to go off of here.
[39:40.320 --> 39:40.740]  Yeah!
[39:42.480 --> 39:43.960]  That's exactly what
[39:43.960 --> 39:45.140]  Geoff thought it looked like.
[39:45.540 --> 39:48.160]  I could've drawn it, it would've looked like that.
[39:48.200 --> 39:49.200]  World clear!
[39:49.740 --> 39:50.240]  We did it.
[39:51.800 --> 39:52.600]  Smashing this.
[39:53.500 --> 39:54.380]  Let's keep going.
[39:54.660 --> 39:57.000]  We have guns?
[39:57.180 --> 39:58.180]  We've got hands.
[39:59.820 --> 40:01.140]  It's one of those hand gimmicks.
[40:01.140 --> 40:03.260]  Press B to shoot.
[40:03.440 --> 40:03.960]  What?
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.340]  Press B to shoot.
[40:06.400 --> 40:07.600]  We're killing each other.
[40:09.500 --> 40:10.580]  Yeah, I'm dead.
[40:10.760 --> 40:12.300]  You guys have murdered me.
[40:15.340 --> 40:17.240]  How did you get reborn?
[40:17.680 --> 40:18.420]  Shoot a wall.
[40:21.500 --> 40:22.840]  So, Andrew, hit B.
[40:27.060 --> 40:28.420]  There you go.
[40:28.420 --> 40:29.200]  Oh!
[40:30.620 --> 40:31.860]  So look out, hang on, stop.
[40:33.140 --> 40:33.540]  Hello.
[40:34.080 --> 40:34.760]  Jump on me.
[40:35.860 --> 40:38.540]  How do we all get across, though?
[40:39.180 --> 40:40.140]  We'll kill ourselves.
[40:40.500 --> 40:40.960]  Yeah, do it.
[40:41.640 --> 40:42.660]  And then I'll shoot green through.
[40:42.960 --> 40:44.800]  Oh, nevermind.
[40:52.190 --> 40:54.130]  Somebody stand on my head and shoot blue.
[40:54.430 --> 40:55.010]  Now shoot me.
[40:56.210 --> 40:57.290]  And then shoot him against the wall.
[40:57.290 --> 40:58.630]  Yeah, you've got me in your gun.
[40:59.530 --> 41:00.470]  Excuse me, pardon.
[41:02.370 --> 41:03.010]  There we go.
[41:04.970 --> 41:06.110]  I think we'll do the same thing.
[41:06.610 --> 41:06.910]  No!
[41:11.670 --> 41:13.050]  Don't you want to run and jump up?
[41:13.710 --> 41:15.530]  I think we need all of us.
[41:15.710 --> 41:16.270]  Okay, go for it.
[41:16.370 --> 41:17.790]  No, I think red can make the jump.
[41:18.630 --> 41:19.290]  Where's Nick?
[41:21.690 --> 41:22.650]  Oh, there I am.
[41:22.670 --> 41:24.730]  I've got Nick in my gun still.
[41:24.730 --> 41:25.710]  Shoot me across.
[41:26.270 --> 41:27.470]  Nick, I'll take you to the end.
[41:27.590 --> 41:27.830]  Okay.
[41:31.110 --> 41:32.890]  Alright, shoot me against the wall there.
[41:33.930 --> 41:35.370]  Oh, my god.
[41:37.070 --> 41:37.910]  Jump over me.
[41:38.350 --> 41:40.570]  Yo, what's up, chat? What's your favorite part of this?
[41:40.670 --> 41:42.290]  Is it where everyone's just kind of doing
[41:42.290 --> 41:44.110]  whatever they want at any given time?
[41:44.630 --> 41:46.290]  Or what? You let me know.
[41:46.610 --> 41:47.610]  Sound off in the chat.
[41:49.190 --> 41:51.090]  Alright, just one person make it over
[41:51.090 --> 41:52.930]  and then shoot us one by one.
[41:54.770 --> 41:55.170]  What's happening?
[41:56.150 --> 41:58.170]  What's up, chat? How's everyone doing?
[41:58.590 --> 42:00.130]  What's your favorite part of this?
[42:01.830 --> 42:02.470]  Shoot him!
[42:03.250 --> 42:03.490]  Shoot him!
[42:03.870 --> 42:04.630]  Shoot him!
[42:06.350 --> 42:07.570]  Well, why would you shoot him there?
[42:09.090 --> 42:11.990]  I forgot I had somebody in my gun.
[42:12.070 --> 42:12.410]  Alright, now.
[42:12.550 --> 42:14.070]  No, no. Get two people over here
[42:14.070 --> 42:15.610]  and use him as a wall. That's it.
[42:15.810 --> 42:16.870]  Shoot Geoff into Eric.
[42:18.190 --> 42:18.850]  There you go.
[42:19.710 --> 42:20.590]  Don't shoot me!
[42:21.050 --> 42:22.450]  Please, leave me alone.
[42:22.570 --> 42:23.290]  I don't want any part of this.
[42:26.870 --> 42:28.230]  Why would you do that?
[42:29.810 --> 42:30.190]  Win?
[42:30.710 --> 42:31.830]  Yeah, go! Get in!
[42:32.850 --> 42:34.090]  Wait, did Nick not come?
[42:34.990 --> 42:36.330]  No, I got him
[42:36.330 --> 42:37.490]  and then you shot me.
[42:37.990 --> 42:40.770]  Oh, so we could have done that. Everyone could be inside each other?
[42:42.610 --> 42:44.910]  Can we all be in one room and come true for you, Gavin?
[42:47.470 --> 42:48.390]  Somebody just asked
[42:48.390 --> 42:50.330]  if this is what immunity bullets are.
[42:50.330 --> 42:51.330]  Oh my god.
[42:51.570 --> 42:52.630]  Those are permanent.
[42:52.910 --> 42:54.510]  You morons.
[42:55.590 --> 42:56.910]  I was looking at the chat.
[42:58.270 --> 42:59.830]  Okay, you are... nope.
[43:01.030 --> 43:01.850]  I've got you, Nick.
[43:02.790 --> 43:03.930]  I think you may have...
[43:03.930 --> 43:04.370]  Yay!
[43:05.590 --> 43:06.570]  That's how you do it.
[43:07.230 --> 43:07.670]  Okay.
[43:09.530 --> 43:11.090]  Now suck the shit out of me.
[43:11.670 --> 43:12.790]  Let go of me, Geoff.
[43:13.890 --> 43:14.630]  Thank you.
[43:18.930 --> 43:20.490]  Hey, Geoff. I don't want you to go anywhere.
[43:20.590 --> 43:21.350]  What are you two doing?
[43:22.290 --> 43:23.510]  Eric's trying to kill me.
[43:25.190 --> 43:26.430]  Why is he killing you?
[43:26.750 --> 43:27.810]  Because I'm mad at him.
[43:29.350 --> 43:31.310]  Because I tugged on him a little bit
[43:31.310 --> 43:33.130]  and in retaliation he killed me.
[43:33.390 --> 43:33.590]  Yes.
[43:33.850 --> 43:35.630]  Because I tugged on him a little bit.
[43:35.710 --> 43:36.430]  Please let me go.
[43:37.230 --> 43:38.470]  Oh, you've tugged me.
[43:39.930 --> 43:41.230]  Alright, there we go.
[43:41.350 --> 43:42.630]  Let's get a tug line.
[43:43.930 --> 43:45.910]  Alright, we got green. Somebody tug blue.
[43:46.890 --> 43:47.810]  Alright, we got it.
[43:47.810 --> 43:49.110]  Alright, we're good. We're so good.
[43:49.270 --> 43:51.150]  Alright, jump. Okay.
[43:51.830 --> 43:53.990]  Jump. Alright, now jump. Now tug me.
[43:54.130 --> 43:55.630]  There we go. Look at that. Tugging him up.
[43:55.690 --> 43:56.870]  Push me, pull you. Hang on, wait.
[43:57.830 --> 44:00.050]  Nice. Let's stay in a big tug line and we'll be safe.
[44:00.270 --> 44:00.770]  There you go.
[44:01.550 --> 44:02.810]  I was tugging.
[44:03.270 --> 44:04.650]  Oh, should I have been facing you?
[44:04.650 --> 44:05.470]  No one was tugging blue.
[44:05.670 --> 44:06.770]  I think you gotta tug harder.
[44:10.870 --> 44:11.910]  What are you...
[44:13.510 --> 44:13.870]  Jesus.
[44:13.870 --> 44:16.530]  You just started going.
[44:18.090 --> 44:19.910]  Alright, can you pull me back onto the...
[44:19.910 --> 44:21.770]  Oh, I see Gavin's trying to suck me.
[44:22.570 --> 44:23.450]  Jesus Christ.
[44:24.430 --> 44:25.350]  Do you want me to not?
[44:25.510 --> 44:27.110]  You sucked me dry. What the fuck?
[44:27.170 --> 44:27.730]  Why would you?
[44:30.290 --> 44:30.730]  Gavin.
[44:31.810 --> 44:32.250]  Gavin.
[44:32.950 --> 44:35.410]  I've always sucked at this point. Am I not supposed to suck?
[44:35.410 --> 44:38.790]  I agree that you fucking suck at this point.
[44:39.010 --> 44:39.150]  Yeah.
[44:39.570 --> 44:40.010]  Okay.
[44:40.010 --> 44:40.130]  Okay.
[44:42.250 --> 44:42.610]  Gotcha.
[44:43.350 --> 44:44.170]  Alright, now you get him.
[44:45.730 --> 44:46.910]  There we go.
[44:47.590 --> 44:48.950]  Wow, I didn't need to suck at all.
[44:49.150 --> 44:50.770]  Now suck Geoff.
[44:52.850 --> 44:53.510]  Alright, I'm gonna...
[44:53.510 --> 44:54.050]  Wait, wait, wait.
[44:56.230 --> 44:58.070]  Alright, in that one I'm gonna face backwards
[44:58.070 --> 44:59.070]  and pull Geoff over.
[45:00.070 --> 45:00.870]  So Geoff will be the...
[45:00.870 --> 45:01.670]  Here I go.
[45:02.450 --> 45:04.630]  Alright, now let's get Eric.
[45:05.870 --> 45:06.230]  Gavin.
[45:06.230 --> 45:07.750]  Okay, now Eric.
[45:09.210 --> 45:09.570]  Eric?
[45:09.870 --> 45:10.910]  I don't want to.
[45:11.430 --> 45:13.330]  Let me get on your head, Nick, and I'll get him.
[45:15.530 --> 45:17.190]  Just know that I'm doing this against my will.
[45:19.690 --> 45:20.050]  Well...
[45:20.050 --> 45:20.430]  Suck me.
[45:20.590 --> 45:21.210]  Okay, what are we doing?
[45:21.330 --> 45:21.770]  Suck me.
[45:23.050 --> 45:23.410]  Gavin!
[45:25.750 --> 45:27.570]  I'm pulling Gavin in. I don't care.
[45:28.450 --> 45:29.890]  Someone in the back, face back.
[45:30.110 --> 45:31.090]  And then Geoff can be on the back.
[45:32.230 --> 45:33.210]  Nick, face the other way.
[45:33.210 --> 45:35.210]  You're sucking me your way.
[45:35.450 --> 45:36.750]  I'm not sucking anything.
[45:36.930 --> 45:38.270]  Stop sucking my face!
[45:38.410 --> 45:39.690]  Is Eric sucking through?
[45:40.230 --> 45:41.890]  I'm not touching anything.
[45:42.410 --> 45:44.430]  Wait, how is that gonna help?
[45:44.990 --> 45:45.750]  Eric, you gotta suck.
[45:46.130 --> 45:46.990]  Oh, I see.
[45:48.190 --> 45:48.610]  Suck mine.
[45:52.050 --> 45:52.790]  Hey, Gavin.
[45:56.750 --> 45:57.390]  Hey, Gavin.
[46:05.270 --> 46:07.010]  It looked like the suck line was gonna work.
[46:07.110 --> 46:08.310]  Right until the last second there.
[46:09.130 --> 46:10.930]  What? You mean the first?
[46:17.790 --> 46:18.190]  Alright.
[46:18.670 --> 46:20.230]  Let's get Eric down from the shelf.
[46:20.790 --> 46:21.590]  I don't want to.
[46:24.590 --> 46:25.370]  Alright, suck me up!
[46:25.710 --> 46:26.030]  There we go.
[46:27.030 --> 46:27.430]  Okay.
[46:28.390 --> 46:29.750]  So, Geoff gets sucked.
[46:31.570 --> 46:33.030]  Orange needs to...
[46:33.030 --> 46:34.110]  Turn around and look at red.
[46:34.650 --> 46:36.050]  No, red needs to put orange over.
[46:36.730 --> 46:36.950]  Yeah.
[46:37.330 --> 46:38.570]  Red and orange need to go.
[46:39.330 --> 46:41.170]  Red needs to push me. I can't move myself.
[46:41.530 --> 46:44.010]  Red doesn't want to go yet because red will fall.
[46:44.630 --> 46:46.550]  Yeah, right. So blue needs to hold on to him.
[46:46.990 --> 46:48.070]  So put Geoff over.
[46:48.750 --> 46:48.950]  Yeah.
[46:50.850 --> 46:52.330]  We're all sucking from the...
[46:53.850 --> 46:54.970]  So did you not...
[46:54.970 --> 46:56.310]  You just didn't hit the suck button at all?
[46:56.430 --> 46:57.490]  You were just kinda like hanging out?
[46:57.490 --> 46:58.170]  Who?
[46:59.270 --> 46:59.710]  Andrew.
[47:00.450 --> 47:01.750]  I was sucking the whole time!
[47:03.210 --> 47:05.530]  I agree you were sucking the whole time.
[47:05.630 --> 47:07.030]  I was holding B!
[47:07.430 --> 47:08.350]  Shut the fuck up!
[47:08.430 --> 47:10.330]  You don't know what you're talking about!
[47:10.550 --> 47:11.570]  I was sucking away!
[47:13.590 --> 47:15.190]  That's the suckiest suck!
[47:16.430 --> 47:16.590]  Alright.
[47:17.050 --> 47:17.630]  Suck Eric up.
[47:18.530 --> 47:20.030]  Eric, get down! You schmuck!
[47:20.210 --> 47:20.710]  Climb down!
[47:23.130 --> 47:23.570]  God.
[47:24.330 --> 47:24.730]  Jesus!
[47:26.610 --> 47:28.150]  Hey, he came down that time, guys.
[47:29.050 --> 47:30.150]  Alright, catch me!
[47:32.010 --> 47:33.850]  Your body checked you down there.
[47:35.390 --> 47:36.650]  Alright, everyone just chill out.
[47:36.650 --> 47:37.410]  Catch me, daddy! Catch me!
[47:39.250 --> 47:39.650]  Yay.
[47:41.570 --> 47:42.530]  So you can suck
[47:43.090 --> 47:43.830]  two people.
[47:45.550 --> 47:46.890]  So let's keep that in mind for the suck life.
[47:46.910 --> 47:47.510]  How strong is that?
[47:47.770 --> 47:49.410]  Here, come here, Andrew. Let's test it.
[47:50.090 --> 47:51.350]  You can suck beyond someone.
[47:51.790 --> 47:52.630]  Okay, hold on.
[47:53.130 --> 47:54.630]  That is not necessarily true.
[47:55.190 --> 47:56.090]  That's not true at all.
[47:56.150 --> 47:58.950]  It's a one person suck job.
[47:59.130 --> 48:00.110]  It's a single suck.
[48:00.410 --> 48:01.450]  It's a single suck job.
[48:03.770 --> 48:04.870]  So now what?
[48:05.410 --> 48:05.930]  Go ahead.
[48:06.510 --> 48:07.430]  I don't think Nick sucked.
[48:07.990 --> 48:10.410]  I wasn't waiting for him to suck!
[48:10.510 --> 48:11.890]  We were discussing options!
[48:13.030 --> 48:14.230]  I don't think Nick's a sucker.
[48:14.830 --> 48:15.110]  God.
[48:15.110 --> 48:16.770]  Oh, god.
[48:19.270 --> 48:21.370]  I assumed Eric was gonna stay up in his hidey hole.
[48:22.070 --> 48:22.290]  Nope.
[48:22.930 --> 48:23.930]  Okay, well, are you ready now?
[48:24.290 --> 48:24.970]  I'm sucking.
[48:26.090 --> 48:28.450]  Oh, shit. You sucked me by accident.
[48:31.110 --> 48:32.790]  Nick, just do that, and then
[48:32.790 --> 48:34.090]  Eric can jump on my head.
[48:34.170 --> 48:35.070]  I hate this so much.
[48:36.350 --> 48:38.330]  Why can't we do this part anymore?
[48:38.370 --> 48:39.050]  Let me go!
[48:40.630 --> 48:42.830]  I let you go. That was my fault.
[48:43.590 --> 48:44.750]  Alright, now jump down.
[48:45.550 --> 48:47.330]  Why? Just go all the way across
[48:47.330 --> 48:48.390]  and then suck me and then go.
[48:48.670 --> 48:50.170]  Why are we making it complicated?
[48:50.510 --> 48:51.590]  It's not complicated. It's easy.
[48:51.850 --> 48:54.190]  It's not easy. I just want to be done with this.
[48:59.110 --> 48:59.870]  Thank you.
[49:00.250 --> 49:01.570]  So everyone get in a line,
[49:02.350 --> 49:04.270]  and we're just gonna go across this way.
[49:09.570 --> 49:10.670]  What was that?
[49:11.170 --> 49:12.810]  I don't know. I really don't.
[49:13.550 --> 49:15.470]  I was sucking so hard.
[49:17.150 --> 49:18.710]  I was full sucking.
[49:18.830 --> 49:20.310]  We need to test something.
[49:20.370 --> 49:21.630]  I don't know what's going on.
[49:22.130 --> 49:24.110]  I had suck pixels going like crazy.
[49:27.090 --> 49:28.910]  Alright, maybe just two of us should test it.
[49:29.130 --> 49:30.070]  Alright, we'll suck each other.
[49:30.550 --> 49:31.610]  Let's suck each other over.
[49:31.690 --> 49:34.050]  It's not letting me walk, though, if I'm sucking.
[49:36.970 --> 49:39.170]  It needs to be trio, at least.
[49:39.390 --> 49:40.410]  Okay, yeah, I think you're right.
[49:40.410 --> 49:41.490]  Whoops, shit.
[49:42.230 --> 49:44.730]  I just don't... Why did you hit anything?
[49:47.030 --> 49:50.090]  Why did you press any buttons?
[49:50.370 --> 49:51.250]  Like, what happened?
[49:52.250 --> 49:54.130]  I think I was still pressing it.
[49:54.630 --> 49:55.970]  There we go.
[49:58.550 --> 50:00.050]  There we go.
[50:00.270 --> 50:02.470]  Alright, so it seems like
[50:02.470 --> 50:04.410]  the middle person...
[50:05.230 --> 50:06.610]  Alright, what if...
[50:06.610 --> 50:07.770]  Oh my god.
[50:09.290 --> 50:10.790]  What if everyone just does whatever
[50:10.790 --> 50:11.770]  and we don't talk about it?
[50:12.950 --> 50:15.030]  That seems to really be working for us.
[50:19.210 --> 50:20.570]  Why wouldn't we go in order?
[50:21.830 --> 50:22.550]  What do you mean?
[50:22.790 --> 50:24.190]  In what world would I not be second?
[50:24.350 --> 50:25.310]  Just suck me.
[50:26.030 --> 50:28.530]  Because I always go at the start!
[50:28.990 --> 50:30.910]  Suck me and then everyone jump on me.
[50:32.870 --> 50:34.510]  I always go at the start.
[50:34.530 --> 50:35.390]  Jump on my head, Eric.
[50:35.390 --> 50:35.610]  Alright, here.
[50:35.790 --> 50:44.700]  I don't want to cross.
[50:45.140 --> 50:46.520]  Stop sucking me, stop!
[50:46.660 --> 50:47.360]  I'm trying to suck him.
[50:49.580 --> 50:50.480]  Alright, so let's practice.
[50:50.600 --> 50:51.560]  Alright, so how are we doing this?
[50:52.640 --> 50:54.780]  So look, you can hold someone over the hole, right?
[50:54.900 --> 50:55.320]  Can you do that?
[50:55.580 --> 50:58.460]  So I'm going to put someone over the hole. It's you.
[50:58.760 --> 50:58.980]  Okay.
[51:00.220 --> 51:00.460]  Alright.
[51:02.160 --> 51:03.200]  Now pull me over.
[51:03.200 --> 51:04.180]  Now you pull him.
[51:04.500 --> 51:05.600]  I don't know why.
[51:05.960 --> 51:09.780]  Now you suck him.
[51:09.940 --> 51:10.760]  Now suck him over here.
[51:10.960 --> 51:13.920]  You had the opportunity to do the funniest thing.
[51:14.940 --> 51:16.880]  You guys gotta stop saying shit like that.
[51:17.040 --> 51:19.120]  You gotta stop saying shit like that.
[51:19.440 --> 51:20.480]  Well that was easy!
[51:20.640 --> 51:21.740]  It was simpler than we thought.
[51:21.740 --> 51:22.280]  I'm sorry.
[51:32.830 --> 51:34.750]  Put the block down.
[51:35.050 --> 51:36.390]  You fucking killed me.
[51:38.630 --> 51:38.890]  I'm okay.
[51:42.650 --> 51:45.030]  I mean, it's just...
[51:45.030 --> 51:46.910]  It's a way where I go like
[51:46.910 --> 51:48.390]  I just don't know...
[51:48.850 --> 51:51.310]  Where's your head at when you do that?
[51:52.850 --> 51:53.690]  Can we test
[51:53.690 --> 51:55.570]  to see if we can all get inside each other?
[51:57.590 --> 51:58.890]  Sure, shoot me.
[52:00.470 --> 52:01.310]  Okay, now what?
[52:01.930 --> 52:02.690]  So I have everyone.
[52:03.190 --> 52:05.270]  Yeah, so go ahead and use...
[52:05.270 --> 52:05.530]  Alright.
[52:06.250 --> 52:10.870]  Alright, so we're back to where we were.
[52:13.070 --> 52:14.470]  Why are we doing this?
[52:15.050 --> 52:16.250]  We need the block.
[52:17.070 --> 52:17.870]  Put the block there.
[52:17.870 --> 52:18.670]  What?
[52:19.690 --> 52:20.510]  Free me!
[52:24.350 --> 52:25.530]  Nick's never getting out.
[52:25.690 --> 52:26.010]  Andrew!
[52:28.030 --> 52:29.650]  Alright, we need the block.
[52:30.310 --> 52:32.210]  Now we need everyone to get inside.
[52:32.650 --> 52:33.930]  Now it's just one person.
[52:34.150 --> 52:35.510]  Right, so everyone get...
[52:35.510 --> 52:36.370]  Everyone eat each other.
[52:37.770 --> 52:38.970]  Now get in.
[52:39.250 --> 52:40.490]  All in one.
[52:41.870 --> 52:43.030]  Blue, you shoot red.
[52:43.270 --> 52:44.230]  Orange, you shoot blue.
[52:44.230 --> 52:45.630]  Yeah, okay.
[52:45.850 --> 52:46.710]  Geoff, shoot that.
[52:47.390 --> 52:48.010]  There you go.
[52:49.770 --> 52:51.270]  Geoff, you shoot.
[52:51.950 --> 52:53.050]  Alright, and then Geoff...
[52:53.050 --> 52:55.110]  You get shot, Geoff, by Nick.
[52:56.410 --> 52:57.410]  No, it's the other way.
[52:57.570 --> 52:58.590]  Geoff, you shoot Nick.
[53:01.990 --> 53:03.790]  You guys are fucking dumb.
[53:05.410 --> 53:06.290]  Alright, well...
[53:06.290 --> 53:07.370]  That again...
[53:07.370 --> 53:09.650]  He just told me to shoot Nick!
[53:10.730 --> 53:12.110]  Alright, I'm gonna shoot Andrew.
[53:12.110 --> 53:13.670]  Alright, now you shoot me.
[53:13.730 --> 53:16.570]  Only shoot a person who has a different colored gun.
[53:17.010 --> 53:17.830]  Geoff, shoot Nick.
[53:19.670 --> 53:20.470]  Thank you.
[53:25.640 --> 53:25.960]  Judas.
[53:28.300 --> 53:29.400]  Jump. Jump and shoot.
[53:30.480 --> 53:31.500]  You wanted to jump?
[53:32.920 --> 53:33.920]  Well, not now.
[53:34.180 --> 53:36.060]  Well, not any... Yeah, I mean, you can now.
[53:36.200 --> 53:38.340]  I mean, it should be pretty clear what you're supposed to do,
[53:38.460 --> 53:39.040]  where you were.
[53:40.080 --> 53:41.740]  Alright, you gotta time this just right, Gavin.
[53:42.720 --> 53:44.180]  No, he doesn't have anyone else in his gun.
[53:44.180 --> 53:44.860]  Wait, what do you mean?
[53:46.620 --> 53:47.320]  It's done.
[53:47.720 --> 53:49.020]  We have to restart the level.
[53:50.460 --> 53:52.440]  Yeah, shoot everyone out.
[53:53.480 --> 53:54.300]  Nick, shoot someone out.
[53:54.440 --> 53:54.780]  Look at this.
[53:55.960 --> 53:56.900]  I got it. Bam.
[53:57.460 --> 53:58.280]  Look at that.
[53:59.640 --> 54:02.180]  Who could have possibly solved the puzzle?
[54:03.340 --> 54:04.580]  Alright, Nick solved the puzzle.
[54:04.780 --> 54:05.040]  You're with me.
[54:05.100 --> 54:05.740]  Alright, here we go.
[54:07.400 --> 54:08.280]  We shoot him.
[54:09.660 --> 54:10.780]  Shoot me as I come down.
[54:11.880 --> 54:12.740]  Here I go.
[54:14.660 --> 54:17.200]  And Nick solved the puzzle.
[54:17.420 --> 54:17.700]  I did.
[54:18.500 --> 54:19.340]  Oh, I got someone.
[54:20.740 --> 54:21.660]  Free him.
[54:24.500 --> 54:25.060]  Ready?
[54:25.700 --> 54:26.460]  Alright, here we go.
[54:27.020 --> 54:27.380]  Here we go.
[54:27.920 --> 54:28.320]  Here we go.
[54:30.680 --> 54:33.520]  Just keep moving right and he'll land on the ground.
[54:34.080 --> 54:34.340]  Oh, yeah.
[54:35.820 --> 54:36.520]  Alright, we did it.
[54:36.880 --> 54:38.160]  The brain.
[54:38.160 --> 54:40.080]  You took me again, Gavin.
[54:41.100 --> 54:41.760]  I solved the puzzle.
[54:43.200 --> 54:44.380]  Nick solved the puzzle, guys.
[54:44.820 --> 54:46.060]  I did solve the puzzle.
[54:46.160 --> 54:48.020]  I know, that's why I said Nick solved the puzzle.
[54:48.180 --> 54:49.660]  That sounded sarcastic.
[54:50.340 --> 54:52.280]  Yeah, I mean it was, but Nick solved the puzzle.
[54:52.560 --> 54:53.540]  But I solved the puzzle.
[54:57.480 --> 55:00.380]  Oh, we gotta suck the box down?
[55:01.760 --> 55:02.700]  Are we in another suck line?
[55:03.340 --> 55:04.140]  Yeah, I think so.
[55:07.140 --> 55:07.700]  Well...
[55:07.700 --> 55:09.120]  I think we gotta get like four people sucked.
[55:10.800 --> 55:12.580]  And the front person won't suck.
[55:13.400 --> 55:15.080]  So like, Geoff sucked Eric
[55:15.080 --> 55:16.020]  and Eric sucked Nick.
[55:17.300 --> 55:18.900]  And then we'll hold everyone out
[55:18.900 --> 55:19.520]  over this thing.
[55:19.800 --> 55:19.840]  Yeah!
[55:20.740 --> 55:21.800]  You dick!
[55:23.940 --> 55:24.860]  Let's do it.
[55:31.680 --> 55:32.620]  Did that work?
[55:32.920 --> 55:35.500]  No! The block needs to go on that!
[55:36.080 --> 55:36.520]  Right.
[55:37.900 --> 55:39.000]  There we go.
[55:39.280 --> 55:40.420]  What are you doing?
[55:41.180 --> 55:41.640]  It's fine.
[55:44.200 --> 55:44.940]  Push it off!
[55:45.980 --> 55:47.700]  We're all gonna...
[55:47.700 --> 55:48.260]  die.
[55:49.840 --> 55:50.200]  Yes!
[55:50.780 --> 55:52.580]  Shouldn't we all be up on that thing with him?
[55:53.580 --> 55:54.760]  How do we get the key though?
[55:56.120 --> 55:57.340]  There's surely gonna be someone...
[55:57.340 --> 55:58.620]  How do we get the key?
[56:01.600 --> 56:02.640]  We'll deal with that later.
[56:04.060 --> 56:05.040]  Maybe on the way back.
[56:05.120 --> 56:06.580]  Yeah, I'll get...
[56:07.900 --> 56:09.360]  The block needs to go down here.
[56:09.460 --> 56:10.060]  Why are we...
[56:10.060 --> 56:11.740]  Hold the button down with the block.
[56:12.140 --> 56:13.620]  I just thought we would grab it on the right.
[56:14.640 --> 56:14.960]  Why?
[56:16.680 --> 56:17.600]  What on the right?
[56:18.580 --> 56:20.220]  Like, drop it, you know.
[56:20.980 --> 56:22.180]  Yeah, I know what you mean, Geoff.
[56:25.780 --> 56:26.440]  Alright, and then we have
[56:26.440 --> 56:28.580]  ten seconds to get on that platform.
[56:29.180 --> 56:29.440]  Alright, go!
[56:30.200 --> 56:31.140]  Here, we gotta suck him up!
[56:31.140 --> 56:33.500]  You should get on top of me, I think, Nick.
[56:33.600 --> 56:34.160]  Yeah, you're right.
[56:36.140 --> 56:37.060]  I don't know about the key,
[56:37.180 --> 56:37.940]  but we'll find out.
[56:38.060 --> 56:39.760]  I don't know how we're supposed to get the key or hit the button.
[56:39.840 --> 56:40.280]  We gotta hit the button!
[56:41.720 --> 56:42.000]  Whoa!
[56:45.280 --> 56:45.560]  Wow!
[56:48.860 --> 56:49.020]  That's a lot!
[56:49.020 --> 56:50.100]  Do you wanna try pushing it to the right?
[56:50.140 --> 56:51.100]  I don't think it's gonna do anything.
[56:51.540 --> 56:52.580]  Nah, I don't think it's gonna matter.
[56:53.160 --> 56:53.980]  That's a lot!
[56:55.520 --> 56:57.540]  Guys, get out of the way so I can be free!
[57:01.100 --> 57:01.580]  Why?
[57:02.840 --> 57:04.180]  Why isn't anyone pushing
[57:04.180 --> 57:04.720]  the fuck?
[57:06.780 --> 57:08.040]  Andrew's just hanging out.
[57:09.560 --> 57:09.700]  Alright.
[57:10.400 --> 57:11.220]  Are you gonna wait for Andrew?
[57:11.880 --> 57:12.120]  Yeah.
[57:12.820 --> 57:14.340]  How you doing there, Geoff?
[57:16.600 --> 57:18.060]  What? I didn't move!
[57:18.140 --> 57:18.900]  I didn't do anything?
[57:19.100 --> 57:20.760]  That was all...
[57:20.760 --> 57:22.100]  How did that kill you?
[57:22.360 --> 57:23.340]  Purple's the problem.
[57:24.640 --> 57:25.440]  Purple's bad.
[57:27.220 --> 57:27.920]  I don't get it.
[57:30.240 --> 57:31.380]  I just wanna be over here,
[57:31.480 --> 57:32.080]  left alone.
[57:33.000 --> 57:33.900]  I didn't kill you, Geoff.
[57:35.320 --> 57:36.300]  Okay, you got Nick?
[57:37.420 --> 57:39.100]  Alright, so I'm gonna jump on the button?
[57:39.620 --> 57:41.640]  But I think you have to wait until it hits
[57:41.640 --> 57:43.440]  the end. I think we gotta go all the way across
[57:43.440 --> 57:44.480]  and then it comes back slower.
[57:45.640 --> 57:46.400]  I think.
[57:46.900 --> 57:48.200]  Oh my god.
[57:50.160 --> 57:51.760]  I don't... dude, I don't...
[57:51.760 --> 57:53.600]  Oh, I think the block needs
[57:53.600 --> 57:54.800]  to be... no, but how?
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.440]  So maybe one of us
[57:57.440 --> 57:59.420]  press the button and the block should...
[57:59.420 --> 58:00.680]  So we don't need the block...
[58:00.680 --> 58:02.380]  Go! Go! Go!
[58:05.100 --> 58:05.640]  Everyone's a
[58:05.640 --> 58:07.720]  fucking moron. There's no go, it's the next one
[58:07.720 --> 58:08.140]  clearly.
[58:09.800 --> 58:10.200]  Like...
[58:12.460 --> 58:13.200]  You aren't a...
[58:13.200 --> 58:14.760]  You aren't a board game guy.
[58:14.760 --> 58:16.960]  Okay, so Nick, you stay down there, we're all gonna get up here.
[58:16.960 --> 58:17.540]  Yeah.
[58:21.960 --> 58:23.200]  You're definitely right, Nick.
[58:24.100 --> 58:24.460]  Alright.
[58:25.420 --> 58:26.900]  Should we maybe get that on there
[58:26.900 --> 58:28.200]  first, just to make sure it's secured?
[58:29.120 --> 58:30.780]  I'll pull it. You got it?
[58:31.240 --> 58:32.280]  Okay. Ready?
[58:33.300 --> 58:35.140]  Uh, yeah. Okay, somebody get Nick up.
[58:37.160 --> 58:37.520]  Alright.
[58:37.820 --> 58:40.260]  We have to, we'll die.
[58:40.560 --> 58:41.800]  I don't think we have a choice.
[58:43.560 --> 58:44.980]  I gotta get out of the way.
[58:44.980 --> 58:45.340]  Okay, well.
[58:46.600 --> 58:48.120]  Physics are messed up.
[58:48.800 --> 58:49.640]  The physics are messed up.
[58:50.740 --> 58:51.820]  Who's gonna push it, Eric?
[58:52.100 --> 58:52.840]  There's two sides.
[58:54.080 --> 58:55.780]  Yeah, and you were on the wrong one of them.
[58:56.020 --> 58:58.420]  What if we just send one person in the block?
[58:59.260 --> 59:00.820]  We'll die, it'll launch us off.
[59:01.040 --> 59:02.880]  It'll launch us all into the middle, we'll die.
[59:03.180 --> 59:04.060]  We have to get the key anyway.
[59:05.840 --> 59:06.200]  But...
[59:06.200 --> 59:07.660]  Yeah, we have to write it back.
[59:07.680 --> 59:10.160]  The camera moves from the left to the right.
[59:10.940 --> 59:12.020]  We're going, we're going.
[59:12.020 --> 59:14.060]  Let's just see what happens with one person.
[59:14.260 --> 59:14.840]  Well, why?
[59:15.200 --> 59:16.940]  Eric, you gotta suck us back!
[59:18.020 --> 59:18.460]  Well...
[59:21.020 --> 59:21.840]  Dead instantly.
[59:22.400 --> 59:22.980]  Did we win?
[59:23.380 --> 59:24.040]  Yeah, I see what you mean.
[59:25.780 --> 59:26.880]  Now we know.
[59:27.980 --> 59:29.140]  We always knew!
[59:30.360 --> 59:33.200]  No, we always knew!
[59:34.280 --> 59:35.620]  I'm just making sure that we knew.
[59:36.000 --> 59:37.620]  That was one of those, I definitely did know,
[59:37.680 --> 59:39.020]  and then I just discarded the information.
[59:39.940 --> 59:41.840]  We're gonna push it as far to the edge as we can.
[59:41.840 --> 59:43.140]  Gavin, Nick, I'm gonna grab you,
[59:43.460 --> 59:45.480]  and then, uh, Blue,
[59:45.680 --> 59:47.120]  you need to be on top of Orange.
[59:48.020 --> 59:49.960]  Alright, so whoever's in the middle right now
[59:49.960 --> 59:52.140]  is gonna be in charge of pushing the block off.
[59:52.840 --> 59:53.820]  Yep, that'll be right.
[59:53.920 --> 59:55.260]  That'll have to be Andrew.
[59:56.120 --> 59:57.640]  Alright, Andrew. Alright, go.
[59:58.520 --> 59:59.920]  So we gotta all get on top.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:00.260]  Go.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.960]  So what are you doing?
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.020]  Why were you already on top of me?
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.100]  So what are you doing, Gavin?
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.700]  Get on top of me immediately.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.920]  Like, what are you, just hanging out?
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.240]  Or, like, what's the plan?
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.420]  There you go. Thank you.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.800]  Did Gavin disconnect?
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:18.600]  Or...
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.940]  He's not moving.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:22.820]  Oh, I think...
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.340]  Uh-oh.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.120]  You think he blue-screened again?
[01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:32.150]  Gavin, but...
[01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:33.010]  We can't...
[01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:35.090]  We can't complete this without him.
[01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:36.030]  Sorry, I...
[01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:37.930]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:39.510]  You son of a bitch.
[01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:40.850]  You scared the shit out of us.
[01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:43.830]  We're, like, blue-screened to death again.
[01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:45.930]  Oh, that's great, Andrew. Keep it right there.
[01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:47.290]  Okay, so...
[01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:49.810]  Everyone get on the platform. I'm grabbing Nick.
[01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:51.890]  Yep. Andrew, are you gonna be the one to press it?
[01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:52.290]  I'm good.
[01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:54.850]  Gavin, stand to get on me.
[01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.330]  And you don't have to do anything. You just stay there on me.
[01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:59.790]  You need to get more to the right.
[01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:00.790]  You need to get more to the right, Gavin.
[01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:03.250]  Alright, there you go.
[01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:04.850]  And now it's all you, Andrew.
[01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.650]  It's you, I believe in you.
[01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:08.990]  He's gonna hit it on the reverse.
[01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:09.810]  Yep.
[01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:12.890]  Okay, so...
[01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:14.470]  Okay, so...
[01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.910]  I'm gonna hit the button, and here's what I'm thinking.
[01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:18.470]  We're gonna press it this time.
[01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:20.990]  We're gonna press the block all the way off,
[01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:22.050]  and we're gonna win.
[01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:23.570]  How does that sound? Okay.
[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:26.570]  Alright, well, to be fair,
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.850]  there's also weird physics on it.
[01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:30.210]  I agree! Totally weird.
[01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:31.250]  Totally weird.
[01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.350]  Weird.
[01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.710]  Now.
[01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.050]  Almost!
[01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:38.510]  Close.
[01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.410]  Close.
[01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:44.530]  Alright, we're getting warmer.
[01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:48.510]  Hey, Blue.
[01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.110]  Yeah, don't worry. He's just fucking off.
[01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.670]  It's okay.
[01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.410]  Only the last person needs to suck.
[01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:57.470]  Other people need help getting up.
[01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:59.130]  Why bother? Geoff, why bother?
[01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:02.690]  Alright.
[01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:04.830]  Just be careful not to run too far.
[01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:07.070]  After you push, Andrew, make sure you don't keep going.
[01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.110]  I know it's tough. You're in a tough spot.
[01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.110]  I believe in you!
[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:11.730]  Sorry.
[01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:14.130]  It's okay. We didn't die.
[01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:17.730]  Sorry, I'm trying to get over it.
[01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:17.950]  Here.
[01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.970]  You got it? Okay.
[01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:22.570]  Oh!
[01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:23.710]  Just hold it over.
[01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:26.550]  Why didn't we fucking think of that?
[01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:28.470]  That's it.
[01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.430]  Then you don't have to push.
[01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:31.890]  Andrew, you're a genius.
[01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.230]  You're a genius, Andrew.
[01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:35.310]  Oh no!
[01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.450]  Alright, the physics didn't agree with that.
[01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:40.470]  And that's okay.
[01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:41.490]  We're learning.
[01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:44.030]  We said the genius thing already, though.
[01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:46.450]  But I think he's got it.
[01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.370]  I think he's got it here.
[01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:50.330]  Geoff, it's fine. I got you.
[01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:52.450]  I know. Don't worry about it.
[01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:53.670]  And then I got you, Nick.
[01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.470]  In a world without E equals MC squared, we're set.
[01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:58.750]  Alright, Andrew, are you sucking it?
[01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:02.570]  Suck it tight. Suck it hard.
[01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:04.290]  Do you want me to suck you?
[01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:04.790]  No.
[01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:08.070]  Okay, and then you're gonna...
[01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.430]  Ready? Hang on. You got it.
[01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:10.890]  Yeah!
[01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:12.810]  Alright, hang on. Stop!
[01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:13.450]  No!
[01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:16.870]  You have to run!
[01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:18.830]  You have to hurry!
[01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.390]  Well, we're dead.
[01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:22.910]  Suck us.
[01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.270]  I cannot believe.
[01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:27.330]  Why did...
[01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:28.650]  Oh my god.
[01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:30.710]  I'm so mad at all of you.
[01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.550]  I'm so mad at all of you.
[01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.370]  Why did we all run off the platform?
[01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:38.350]  Why did we all run off the platform?
[01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:39.770]  Why did we all run off the platform?
[01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:41.150]  I think we were excited.
[01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:43.930]  Let's temper the excitement!
[01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.670]  Well, I think in hindsight,
[01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:47.870]  that's probably a good idea.
[01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.590]  In hindsight, if we don't all make it, just get off.
[01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:53.590]  What? No, it'll still kill us all.
[01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:54.810]  No, it won't!
[01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.110]  It follows us, not it!
[01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:57.930]  You're right.
[01:03:58.590 --> 01:03:59.110]  Thank you.
[01:03:59.490 --> 01:03:59.890]  Almost.
[01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:04.810]  Andrew, you did a great job.
[01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:06.410]  That was really good work, Andrew.
[01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.210]  That was killer, dude.
[01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:09.130]  That was big boy work.
[01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:10.310]  I'm trying.
[01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:11.770]  You nailed it.
[01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:13.230]  Can you do it again?
[01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:17.890]  You got it.
[01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.750]  Andrew, you're gonna go get the key?
[01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:20.890]  Yep, we're gonna stay here.
[01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.130]  Nick, you're gonna go over, suck him up, bring him up.
[01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:26.250]  We need the button again.
[01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.750]  Somebody has to press the button.
[01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:28.230]  I'll get it.
[01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:33.290]  Plenty of time.
[01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.910]  Nice and easy.
[01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.790]  Gavin, you almost...
[01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.190]  Why?
[01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:41.390]  We do have to get off.
[01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:43.310]  We do have to get off.
[01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.910]  Out of the way.
[01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:46.150]  Alright, I have the key.
[01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:49.930]  Never again.
[01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:51.430]  Gavin doesn't want it to end.
[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:54.490]  Don't want to do that level ever again.
[01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:55.790]  That's a great one.
[01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:56.050]  No.
[01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:00.590]  Last one.
[01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:03.270]  Last one and then we're the kings of Pico Park.
[01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.990]  Oh, God.
[01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:05.590]  Burn it down.
[01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:07.150]  Oh, no.
[01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:08.990]  Hey, Gavin.
[01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:09.910]  Just testing.
[01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:12.110]  Okay, just making sure.
[01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.370]  Oops.
[01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:14.530]  Hey, Geoff.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:17.930]  Alright.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.400]  Me and you.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.140]  We need, I think...
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.920]  We need one more
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.660]  person.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.500]  How did you jump the button?
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.520]  Oh, okay.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.120]  Here.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.000]  Jump on top of me, Blue.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.220]  And then Green, jump on top of me
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.300]  and get up on top of Blue.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.540]  I'm gonna die.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:45.940]  No, you won't.
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.600]  See? Now go get the one.
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.140]  Oh, I'm the one
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.480]  getting it. I'm sorry. I got confused.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.180]  There we go. I see, I see, I see.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.200]  Move, Red. Move left. Just go left.
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:01.540]  What?
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.660]  Oh, dear God.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.720]  It's a little bouncer.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.600]  Why? What?
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.380]  You can get out from under there now
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.200]  if you want to get out. Like, Green and
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.200]  Red should be able to go past him, right?
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.320]  What?
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.660]  I guess not. I guess you're solid.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:18.420]  What?
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.580]  Don't I have to eventually
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.720]  stand on top of... to block the
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.660]  top one? Yeah, I think he just needs to
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.000]  stand to block. We need to put the button...
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.560]  We need to put the block on the button, right?
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.960]  I would assume so. It makes the block jump.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.100]  Oh, people are...
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.220]  Then I think we have to use it as a step.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.100]  So just move it all the way to the right
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.100]  and then we all... I think that's what it is.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:40.840]  Okay.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.940]  How do we
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.800]  get out of the way?
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.440]  I'm pretty sure that's not right.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.320]  Well, why don't you put it on the person
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.220]  at the edge's head?
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.780]  There we go. And then what?
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.880]  And then you walk across and push it?
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.140]  And then you jump it up here.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.660]  How are we...
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.340]  And then what?
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:04.700]  And then I'm
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.760]  taking it.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.640]  Okay, let's walk... so how do we walk it
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.960]  across then? Yeah, how do we do that?
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.560]  Gavin, I think
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.620]  you have to? Yeah, I think Gavin
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.400]  needs to... well, not like that.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.720]  What does the button do again? It jumps the
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.620]  block. So we just
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.240]  need to jump the block with the button.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:26.680]  Shall I just
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.600]  block the... alright, what if, Geoff,
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.620]  what if you just stand here and then everyone
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.480]  deals with it?
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.720]  Hang on,
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.700]  I'll walk out. Nick,
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.660]  red go left, purple go left. Okay, now red go up.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.180]  Red jump up.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.800]  Okay, here we go. So now what?
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.560]  I don't know.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.660]  Blue, let's move forward and jump
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.820]  it and see if we can jump it up onto that block.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.560]  There you go. The button
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.540]  just bounces it. Okay, so you see
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.620]  if you can jump it onto that button. There you go.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.300]  Get it stuck up there
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.480]  so then red or
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.600]  whoever has the shield... You have the
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.600]  shield. Yeah, so get it stuck up
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.600]  there so whoever has the shield can then climb up and get
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.460]  the key. Alright, so wait
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.840]  but I'm gonna... I don't know.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.840]  So wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.800]  Geoff, why don't you just
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.600]  go up there now and stand on that.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.680]  Well, hang on, Nick, go up first.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.280]  Nick, uh...
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.520]  I did nothing. I didn't
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.260]  move. I stood there. No, no, you didn't do anything.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.720]  Okay, yeah, okay. Just making...
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:29.900]  Alright, Gavin, you wanna jump on me?
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.000]  Do that again.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:32.760]  Okay.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.420]  I mean, just put... I don't know. Why don't we just get
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.400]  the block and use it as the step down here and then everyone goes?
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.060]  Yeah.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:44.140]  Well...
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.560]  Because then how do we get back up? I think the fact that it
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.260]  jumps tells me it needs to jump.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:49.820]  Okay.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.100]  You know what I mean?
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.300]  So...
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.000]  I think if I can get up there, though,
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.520]  with the block...
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.660]  Okay, I mean, you're up here with the block right now.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.360]  Geoff, you don't go up and to the right.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.180]  No, you go up.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.620]  Can't we... Yeah, but
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.700]  on the safe side of the block. Yeah, jump over to me.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.500]  Jump over to me. Then we can't go left to make it jump.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.800]  Andrew, come over to me.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.400]  What? Okay, whatever.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:15.600]  Whoops.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.260]  That was an accident. No, it's okay.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:20.320]  I think that block is an important
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.180]  step to get the key. I agree.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:22.440]  Okay.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.380]  You weren't the shielded one that time.
[01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.830]  Alright, so...
[01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:38.590]  Alright, so you want to
[01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:39.450]  push up the step, Geoff?
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.360]  And then...
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:49.340]  Well...
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.540]  And then you have to
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.260]  jump on that to jump up there?
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:53.780]  Yeah, I think, right?
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.760]  Yeah, get on top of it.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.560]  Yeah, and then you can just get on top.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.380]  And then, Gavin, you hit the button. Oh, there you go.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.220]  But then how do we...
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.240]  Escape? How do we get back?
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.220]  We have the key now. Uh-oh.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.800]  There's no uh-oh. It's just gonna bounce
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.940]  and he's gonna get underneath it. We just have to hit the
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.420]  button again. You just have to hit the button again.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.320]  We can push it.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:14.480]  Good timing.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.220]  It must be in that game.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:19.920]  There we go.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.100]  One more time. A little bit more.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.540]  There you go. There you go.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.160]  Yeah, a little bit more.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:26.940]  Alright.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.340]  The two people we put in charge
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.780]  of this part are the funniest
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.740]  two people that we could have put in charge of this part.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.480]  It's the netcode.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.960]  There you go. You got it.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.300]  Alright, so...
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.780]  Stop. Stop pushing the fucking button.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.960]  Why did you press the button again?
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.120]  One more time, you moron.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:46.760]  Again.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.120]  That's it.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.840]  Please. Please. Please.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.480]  Stop. I hate you.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.880]  Andrew, go all the way to the right. Geoff, jump on top of
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.360]  Andrew.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:00.520]  There you go.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:01.980]  And then, Andrew, get out of the way.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:04.780]  Okay, and
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.860]  now we need Geoff
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:09.060]  to...
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.020]  We need to make a line.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.940]  Andrew, there you go. All the way to the right.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.240]  All the way to the right. All the way to the right.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.720]  There you go. Okay.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.700]  And get on top.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.260]  Let's get on the safe side, Andrew, for safety.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.000]  Don't go anywhere, Geoff. Geoff!
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.340]  I'm not even touching the controller.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:24.540]  Or the keyboard.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:26.600]  Okay, now how do we get Gavin up?
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.840]  We'll have to jump in perfect unison.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.100]  I don't think that's right.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.840]  Well, I think the point of the block at this point is that
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.680]  Geoff stood on it.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.080]  Oh, so we need to move it left.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:38.800]  Have Geoff
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.320]  come off your head.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.440]  Okay. And then hit the button.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.060]  I don't think you can reach it.
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.440]  I don't know if you can. Can we go left?
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.900]  There we go.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.200]  As far as I can go. We got it. He's on the button.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.120]  So we need the button
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.220]  to be on the other side.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.400]  Push it when it's in the air.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:58.780]  Push it away from the wall.
[01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:05.170]  It's just...
[01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:07.270]  I like this because it's the three
[01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:08.790]  of us watching these two
[01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:10.190]  try to do this thing.
[01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:12.970]  I think... It's so hard.
[01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:14.690]  The thumbnail is just our three characters.
[01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:15.870]  There you go. Oh my god.
[01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:17.710]  Get under it.
[01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:19.590]  Do that again.
[01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:22.030]  Yes!
[01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:23.410]  So now what?
[01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:25.910]  Run. Run under it.
[01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.630]  Run out from under it.
[01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:29.250]  Okay.
[01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.890]  Now...
[01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:35.910]  Yeah, now...
[01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:38.010]  Yeah, but then what?
[01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:40.970]  Okay, you're gonna have to jump at the same...
[01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:41.910]  On three.
[01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:44.030]  No, no, no.
[01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:45.710]  This is not right.
[01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:48.010]  Geoff, you need to press the button
[01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:50.690]  so Gavin can run under it.
[01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:50.910]  Okay.
[01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:53.630]  Geoff just needs to stand on the block
[01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:54.810]  on the other side of Gavin.
[01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:57.670]  Alright, now press it.
[01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:59.270]  Yeah!
[01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:01.430]  So now, you press it.
[01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.010]  You push it all the way into Gavin.
[01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:05.710]  Stop pressing the button. Push it all the way into Gavin.
[01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:08.030]  I'll go fucking push that button one more time.
[01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:10.030]  Go push it!
[01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:11.090]  No, I'm not gonna do it.
[01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:13.950]  So Geoff, you jump up.
[01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.610]  Gavin, you wait.
[01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.790]  There you go.
[01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:19.530]  Now everyone move to the right except Geoff.
[01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:20.350]  And now Geoff goes.
[01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.830]  Easy. God, I don't know why it was so hard for you guys.
[01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.630]  I don't know why it was so hard for you.
[01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:28.350]  We did it.
[01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:29.090]  We did it. Listen.
[01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.570]  Congratulations, you and I killed it on that one.
[01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:34.070]  I gotta say, that was great teamwork
[01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:36.170]  from an achievement hunter.
[01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.910]  Way to go, guys.
[01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:38.190]  Oh, a fan.
[01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:40.310]  Can we turn it off?
[01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:42.110]  No?
[01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.510]  Alright.
[01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:47.210]  Alright, just go.
[01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.790]  Yep.
[01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:50.950]  There you go, just go.
[01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:52.130]  What?
[01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:53.230]  Just go.
[01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:55.390]  We gotta make a stack before the fan comes back.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.300]  How?
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.720]  Make a stack. And then we've all gotta
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.520]  adjust our fanage.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.760]  Are you saying
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.940]  we all need to be on top
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.680]  of one another? Like we need to make a tall stack?
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.800]  Yeah, to get the key. And then when the fan comes, you need to stay
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.020]  on top of the person that you're on.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.780]  Oh, Christ.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.440]  Okay, I see.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.220]  Alright, so I'll stay on Eric.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.140]  I gotcha.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:23.520]  Shit.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:30.200]  One more, one more.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.760]  I can't. You gotta readjust.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:33.620]  No!
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:34.800]  No!
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.000]  You got it!
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.300]  Go! Get outta here!
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.680]  Oh, that was so much easier.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.080]  Geoff's gonna go jump
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.360]  in the hole. I'm thinking about it.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:54.960]  Oh, okay.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.560]  Halfway done.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.300]  For speedrun.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:01.960]  That was easy.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.940]  Do you think this might...
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.000]  Do you think this is the best anyone's ever done at this game?
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.920]  No. Oh my god.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.980]  We need to spread out a little bit.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:12.560]  Oh!
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:13.560]  Oh!
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.200]  Oh, they're moving.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.560]  We're good, we're good.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.720]  Well, some of us were.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.500]  Of course, the pilot
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:24.740]  crashes.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.620]  What pilot? You!
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.380]  I fly?
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.520]  Yes! When?
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.380]  You're a pilot!
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.580]  That's your new lot in video games.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.240]  Oh god, what have I done to deserve this?
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.280]  And what have you?
[01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:43.110]  Super Mario Land vibes.
[01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.550]  Andrew, don't go left and right.
[01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:46.250]  What? Andrew, don't go left and right.
[01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.390]  I'm not the problem here.
[01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:50.910]  You! Oh my god.
[01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:53.410]  Just go in. Move. Get out of the way.
[01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:57.410]  Morons. Morons.
[01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:59.290]  Somehow I smell like a rotten egg.
[01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:00.030]  I was here first.
[01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:03.610]  You were there first with no
[01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:04.150]  key.
[01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:06.790]  Just hanging out, scouting the location.
[01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:08.390]  Yeah, hanging out, being in the way.
[01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.690]  I wasn't in the way. I was to the right of the fucking door
[01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:12.050]  where a big boy hangs out.
[01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:12.570]  Make the gun.
[01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.470]  Go red. Go orange.
[01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.510]  Thank god this is recorded so that the world can see.
[01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:19.730]  Alright, red.
[01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:21.690]  You got it.
[01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:23.210]  Netcode!
[01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:27.890]  Stack. Stack em.
[01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:32.250]  So that's the key there?
[01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:33.710]  Yep, stacking.
[01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:35.950]  So Andrew, when you get there,
[01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.270]  stay there. We'll jump on you to jump across.
[01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:39.350]  Alright, good job, Geoff.
[01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:41.570]  We'll jump on you to jump across.
[01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:47.910]  We'll have to make a
[01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:50.190]  stack to get you back.
[01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:51.150]  I'll jump on you. A stack?
[01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:53.590]  A back stack. We're gonna need a back stack.
[01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:55.630]  Oh, is it the button?
[01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.590]  It's the button.
[01:16:58.810 --> 01:16:59.750]  That would have been better if you
[01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:00.330]  pressed it sooner.
[01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:02.790]  I didn't see the button
[01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:04.130]  until I was trying to go back.
[01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:06.030]  I didn't know there was a button. I'm sorry.
[01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.690]  Netcode.
[01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:16.230]  Netcode? Netcode.
[01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:18.650]  Oh god.
[01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:20.170]  That was awesome.
[01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:22.610]  I died. I knew as soon as I jumped.
[01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:24.650]  That was netcode.
[01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:28.330]  Wait, what the?
[01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:30.230]  Gavin.
[01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.330]  Netcode. Netcode.
[01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:36.250]  Well...
[01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:38.410]  Why aren't you going?
[01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:40.890]  Why didn't you go, Gavin?
[01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:42.210]  Oh, was I supposed to?
[01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:42.950]  I thought you were doing the button.
[01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:45.450]  It only takes one button.
[01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.590]  You only need one person.
[01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:50.330]  It only takes one.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.200]  Well, go quickly.
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:57.020]  Please.
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:17:58.820]  Go!
[01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:05.610]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:07.910]  I was reading the thank you sign.
[01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.670]  Oh yeah?
[01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:12.450]  I'm glad you liked it because you get to see it again.
[01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:15.030]  Why would they put that there if they didn't want me to read it?
[01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:16.630]  Geoff got killed by a fan.
[01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:22.890]  I didn't get killed there.
[01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:24.770]  Why would they put that billboard there
[01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:26.130]  if they didn't want me to read it while I was driving?
[01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:29.190]  Exactly.
[01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:31.850]  Does advertising work?
[01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.450]  Just did.
[01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:38.050]  It's just...
[01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:39.590]  It's a team of dunces.
[01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.770]  What's happening?
[01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:43.150]  Andrew!
[01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:45.750]  You're doing fucking great.
[01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:48.770]  I gotta let you know. Andrew, you're killing it on this part.
[01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:50.330]  You're playing your part. I believe in you.
[01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.150]  It's gotta be three deep.
[01:18:55.150 --> 01:18:56.730]  It's gotta be three deep for the joke.
[01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:58.750]  It's gotta be three deep.
[01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:01.210]  I'm getting dizzy.
[01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:04.790]  I'm being trapped by you.
[01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:09.030]  Alright, Geoff.
[01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:11.910]  Way to go, Geoff.
[01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:16.570]  I'm excited to read the
[01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:18.470]  billboard one more time, man.
[01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.890]  It said thank something
[01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:21.850]  but who knows what.
[01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:21.890]  Andrew!
[01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:24.250]  I'm gonna shit vomit.
[01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:35.570]  Alright, go!
[01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:41.930]  Okay, so that was on Geoff, right?
[01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:42.690]  Yes!
[01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.570]  As soon as I jumped, he blew him in the head!
[01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:47.230]  I didn't do anything!
[01:19:47.670 --> 01:19:48.490]  Oh my god!
[01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:50.570]  Nick, why did you stop?
[01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:52.790]  I jumped wrong and then I was recollecting my thoughts.
[01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:54.070]  Get me away from Blue.
[01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:56.950]  I don't want anyone near Blue.
[01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:58.590]  I was just behind you the whole time.
[01:19:58.730 --> 01:19:59.730]  You were trying to kill me.
[01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:01.310]  How could I kill you?
[01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:04.970]  Every time I jump, you jump at the same time and knock me down.
[01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:06.010]  There you go.
[01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:09.370]  Blue! Why did you guys do that?
[01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:10.390]  What do you mean, Blue?
[01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:11.790]  Why did you guys go?
[01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:13.630]  You keep walking off. Guys!
[01:20:13.630 --> 01:20:13.650]  Guys!
[01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:16.770]  Alright, we're good.
[01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:19.070]  Alright. We're good.
[01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:20.910]  Alright, go, Orange! Go!
[01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:23.190]  Go! Jesus Christ!
[01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:24.550]  No!
[01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:26.390]  He just stood there.
[01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:28.670]  You watched him stand there.
[01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:30.810]  Whoever's third, you just gotta go!
[01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:34.110]  Whoever's number three just has to jump.
[01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:35.230]  It's just...
[01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:39.290]  My vision's tunneling in.
[01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:50.740]  There you go.
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:56.160]  Don't get killed by the slug!
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.260]  Come back!
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.440]  We gotta go!
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.880]  Why are we just standing there?
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.060]  Why are you guys...
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.200]  What the fuck?
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.860]  What do you want me to do? We're stuck!
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.040]  We're waiting on people in front of us.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.080]  You're stuck. You are sticking.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:14.220]  No!
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.520]  Sign said thank you.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.780]  Also, I did not die by the slugs.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.800]  FYI. No, Geoff, you did great!
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.260]  I got past them.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.460]  I was in the clear. I had the key.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:25.760]  Oh, Nick.
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:29.860]  Nick.
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:30.980]  Nick.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.060]  When you're on top of them, you have to keep going a little bit.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.300]  Yeah.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.400]  I went to jump afterwards and...
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.840]  Like this. See that?
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:46.980]  Wow.
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:48.740]  Two people went...
[01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:53.210]  Andrew, what are you thinking?
[01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:54.550]  I'm just broken.
[01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.870]  I'm a broken man.
[01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:03.090]  Well, if...
[01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:04.970]  He stopped further
[01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:06.650]  than he usually did that time.
[01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:10.070]  And...
[01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:13.710]  You mother...
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.770]  Space yourselves out, you dunces.
[01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:20.110]  Geoff, you're killing me.
[01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:22.810]  Nick, what happened?
[01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:24.110]  I...
[01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:27.050]  I just want to be over, man.
[01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:28.810]  Then beat it!
[01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:30.930]  I meant life.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:36.780]  Nice.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:39.460]  Beautiful. Let's go.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.220]  Space out.
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.280]  Space out.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.060]  I would listen.
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:49.680]  I want you to watch that back.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.540]  I'm perfect.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.740]  If anything, that was my fault.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.840]  It's okay. I don't blame you because you were just trying to get around and stay alive.
[01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:04.810]  Space out.
[01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:10.750]  Gavin, when you hit it, you gotta go, buddy.
[01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:12.570]  You were on my head.
[01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.970]  You gotta go.
[01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:15.310]  Don't stop.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.860]  I did it.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.120]  Geoff!
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.200]  What?
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.660]  You killed me again.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.180]  You gotta go.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:29.840]  You gotta go.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.300]  I got body checked by Eric again.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.980]  I'm just...
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:43.020]  not in a position
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.700]  where I want to stop moving ever.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.400]  Alright, space it out.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.040]  Alright.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.700]  Please go.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.120]  You can jump on top of them.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.020]  Oh god.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:59.080]  Why'd you go back?
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:00.400]  Why'd you go back?
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.380]  I panicked.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.020]  Oh no.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.000]  He kissed me on the forehead and committed suicide.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.760]  He just wanted you to know he loved you before he died.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.540]  I just had to say goodbye to Gavin.
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:15.820]  Goodbye, my friend.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.320]  I knew I wasn't gonna make it out of that one.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.260]  Oh god!
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:23.560]  Well...
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.080]  Alright, this is easy.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.800]  Hit the thing and go.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.840]  This is the baby stuff.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.140]  What happened to everyone?
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.320]  Looks like Purple got killed.
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:40.380]  Shortly before I got killed.
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.140]  Looks like it.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.240]  It didn't feel right.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:47.840]  I...
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.560]  Yeah?
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:51.080]  Really sorry.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.420]  I just...
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:56.940]  Andrew's gone non-verbal.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.100]  This is hell.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.080]  Andrew, you killed yourself.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:05.880]  That was on me.
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:09.100]  I was stuck in a pool of rage.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:10.420]  That's on me.
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.500]  I was so mad, I disconnected from everything.
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:14.760]  That's on me.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.620]  It's okay.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:18.400]  What was that, Nick?
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.120]  I'm not used to
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.960]  nothing being in front of me.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.900]  I was untethered
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:25.700]  by my own
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.140]  freedom. I don't know.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.520]  It doesn't matter.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.200]  Good job, good job, good job.
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:36.640]  Beautiful.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:40.600]  Why are you blocking me?
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.420]  We have to space out.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.280]  That's on me somehow. Sorry.
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.440]  I don't know what to tell you.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:49.840]  I don't know what to tell you.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:50.980]  First time that's happened.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.480]  That is awful.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:01.700]  Really sad.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:03.920]  Really sad
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:04.860]  sexual noise.
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.120]  I don't think I made any noise.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.660]  Suddenly you went...
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.160]  Alright, here we go.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:13.540]  Alright, purple.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:15.880]  Gavin.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.600]  I feel like I can make this too.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.820]  I felt comfortable
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:21.920]  finally.
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.600]  I was gonna make it that round.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.180]  I was so comfy, I was in the groove.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.180]  Why go, go, go?
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.200]  Because the screen's
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.020]  moving, Nick. Right, but we got plenty
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:34.000]  of time, my man.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.000]  Nick, my man-dia.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.340]  Nick, my man-dia.
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:41.860]  Alright.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:42.620]  Alright.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.600]  Back off me. Back off me.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.960]  Back off him. There we go.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.240]  Whoa, we have to double
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.060]  stack? Oh my god.
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.680]  This is hell on earth.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.740]  Alright, whoever's in front has to go to the right.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.620]  We have to jump on.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:57.400]  This is rough.
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.100]  Are you sure that's right? How are we gonna get
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.940]  the other person over? Alright, well this run
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.540]  might be done. I think there's probably a button.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.580]  Oh shit.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.560]  Gavin, thoughts?
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.640]  I don't know what to tell you, man.
[01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:21.050]  Gavin was
[01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:22.850]  working to finish this ahead
[01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:23.550]  of time.
[01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:26.690]  Give me space, there you go. It would be too quick.
[01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:27.390]  That was on me.
[01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:30.770]  It was a weird glitch
[01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:31.710]  between the two of us.
[01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:38.910]  I don't even wanna eat dinner, I just wanna go to bed.
[01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.630]  Yeah,
[01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:42.970]  I need to take a shower after this, I'm fucking sweaty.
[01:27:45.610 --> 01:27:46.590]  Why? Why?
[01:27:46.630 --> 01:27:48.670]  Why are you on top of me?
[01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:49.850]  Back up!
[01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:53.290]  Back up! I'm just going so fucking fast.
[01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:55.030]  I had no time to wait.
[01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.990]  Y'all motherfuckers
[01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:58.290]  gotta get out of my way.
[01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:05.870]  Oh no!
[01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:12.410]  Oh no!
[01:28:14.410 --> 01:28:16.290]  Man, I wonder if this...
[01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:16.330]  No!
[01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:20.530]  That's me, that one, yeah.
[01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:22.070]  That's on me.
[01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:23.170]  I just need a minute.
[01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:25.550]  I just need a minute.
[01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:28.550]  There's your minute.
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:33.370]  This sucks.
[01:28:33.670 --> 01:28:35.290]  This sucks so bad.
[01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:35.530]  It's so bad.
[01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:38.290]  It's so bad.
[01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:40.570]  Oh god.
[01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.530]  Alright.
[01:28:41.730 --> 01:28:43.950]  You moved again, Andrew, you moved.
[01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:45.450]  You fucked up my time.
[01:28:47.730 --> 01:28:49.110]  I'm never gonna do it.
[01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:50.930]  Alright, Geoff.
[01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:52.150]  You got space, you got...
[01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:55.850]  Geoff, you were doing great on that one.
[01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:59.730]  I'm gonna throw up if we don't make it soon.
[01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:00.850]  I'm gonna throw up.
[01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:02.870]  I'm gonna piss my pants, dude.
[01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:03.330]  Ah!
[01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:05.150]  There.
[01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:12.510]  Well, give me space.
[01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:14.790]  Give me space, you dipshit.
[01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:15.970]  Give me space.
[01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:17.350]  Oh my god.
[01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:30.680]  No! You fucked me!
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:32.100]  You fucked me real good!
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:33.400]  What do you mean?
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.720]  Geoff didn't even jump.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.960]  Nick killed me.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.180]  Nick killed me with words.
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.800]  I can't see anymore.
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.800]  My eyes are full of tears.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.120]  I can't see what color I...
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.340]  It can't be done.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.140]  It can't be done.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:57.480]  Oh god.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.220]  This can't be beat.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:03.200]  I think I'm in fever, technically.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.000]  I think so too, man.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:08.120]  Okay.
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.400]  Alright, we got this. This is it.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.260]  Get the fuck away from me, Gavin.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.540]  God damn.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.720]  Jumping on my fucking head
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.760]  is not the time.
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.740]  If I don't laugh, I'll just cry.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:30.880]  Oh god's sake.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.860]  You wanna hit that jump button one more time.
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:33.720]  Oh my god.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.680]  Why am I so sweatier
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.600]  than mowing my lawn earlier today?
[01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:45.270]  Alright.
[01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.810]  That's beautiful.
[01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:55.030]  You're killing me, man.
[01:30:55.730 --> 01:30:56.690]  Okay, here we go.
[01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:00.490]  I don't know how we're supposed to do this.
[01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:01.710]  I think we can make that jump.
[01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.030]  It says don't push.
[01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.090]  Don't push.
[01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:07.690]  So, everyone...
[01:31:07.690 --> 01:31:09.890]  Oh, it does kill you. It killed us all.
[01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.630]  Yeah.
[01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:12.350]  I think that jump's makeable.
[01:31:12.670 --> 01:31:13.290]  I think so too.
[01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:16.110]  I don't think it's any bigger than that one.
[01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:17.530]  Yeah, I think it's totally makeable.
[01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:21.970]  Oh, sorry. I completely forgot what was happening.
[01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.330]  What?
[01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:23.890]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:26.930]  Not in the sense that we were playing this game,
[01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:28.050]  just what was the next step.
[01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:29.490]  That's okay.
[01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:31.330]  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:32.930]  I suck. I'm sorry.
[01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:34.450]  It's my ability. It's not there.
[01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.950]  Oh.
[01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:39.690]  Oh, my dog's
[01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:41.470]  whining at me. He's like, why are we still in here?
[01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.450]  Why don't you shut up?
[01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:45.590]  I love that I'm upstairs
[01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:47.490]  now in this new house and that I have
[01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:49.490]  to turn the air conditioning off to record.
[01:31:50.370 --> 01:31:50.730]  Why?
[01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:52.890]  It's just too loud.
[01:31:53.230 --> 01:31:54.070]  Why? Leave it on.
[01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:55.450]  No, it's too loud.
[01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:58.850]  Cancel it out.
[01:31:58.850 --> 01:31:59.530]  I can also just
[01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:00.290]  remove it and post.
[01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:03.550]  It's makeable, you just have to be on the edge.
[01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.630]  Don't!
[01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.670]  Yes!
[01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.430]  Go!
[01:32:12.170 --> 01:32:13.590]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much
[01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:14.110]  for watching.

[01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:31.570]  If you guys like that,

[01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:35.750]  be sure to tune in next Friday

[01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:47.250]  regulation gameplay channel,

[01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:54.770]  Let your friends know about that
[01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.590]  and you can go back and watch this
[01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:58.870]  on Tuesday on the regulation gameplay channel
[01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:00.930]  where we put the Twitch VODs
[01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:02.410]  up every week.
[01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:04.950]  I want to thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:07.050]  Thanks to the piss rats
[01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:08.790]  in the chat. Thanks to everyone
[01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:10.650]  who's watching at home. Thank you, Andrew.
[01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:12.750]  Thank you, Geoff. Thank you, Gavin. Thank you, Nick.
[01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:14.710]  We did it. We are the kings of
[01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:15.490]  Pico Park.
[01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:18.110]  I want to go to bed.
[01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:18.550]  Yeah.
[01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:22.070]  My buddy just texted me. He's like, hey, man, you want to stream that
[01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:23.690]  WWE game on your Twitch channel?
[01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:25.710]  He's like, I want to die.
[01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:28.170]  I think I have Carpal Tunnel
[01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:30.170]  after that session. There you go, guys.
[01:33:30.190 --> 01:33:31.810]  Thank you for playing. We did it.
[01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.450]  Bye.
[01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:35.210]  Bye, guys. Bye.
[01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:36.770]  Alright, let me end this.
