[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  And that's how I really feel about rooster teeth.
[00:03.120 --> 00:04.260]  I'm glad I answered the question.
[00:04.400 --> 00:05.820]  Now, I never have to say it again.
[00:06.240 --> 00:06.940]  That's pretty crazy.
[00:07.140 --> 00:08.860]  I can't believe I was like, I don't know.
[00:08.980 --> 00:11.120]  I thought that was interesting that you would.
[00:11.480 --> 00:13.220]  I just don't get why you would bring that up there.
[00:13.240 --> 00:16.760]  And also to do that for like two and a half hours.
[00:16.940 --> 00:19.300]  So unnecessary, like a bad use of my time.
[00:19.300 --> 00:21.260]  But I mean, thanks for talking.
[00:21.720 --> 00:23.620]  Well, I wanted I just needed to get it off my chest.
[00:23.680 --> 00:24.420]  All right. I'm sorry.
[00:24.480 --> 00:25.380]  You were saying something, Nick?
[00:25.460 --> 00:26.240]  Yeah. What's up?
[00:26.760 --> 00:28.080]  Hello. Yeah.
[00:28.580 --> 00:29.880]  Hi. What's up?
[00:30.280 --> 00:34.240]  Hello and welcome to another Halloween game that we're playing.
[00:34.400 --> 00:35.720]  I'm more more of last of us.
[00:35.760 --> 00:37.540]  Part two on Grounded Difficulty.
[00:37.660 --> 00:41.360]  We're trying to get through this game with with limited resources.
[00:42.160 --> 00:44.840]  Know that know that echolocation stuff.
[00:45.460 --> 00:46.940]  And today it's me.
[00:47.040 --> 00:49.880]  I'm Nick. I'm joined by Geoff, who's been here for every single one.
[00:49.940 --> 00:50.680]  It's me. I'm Geoff.
[00:50.760 --> 00:51.780]  Eric, so far.
[00:52.380 --> 00:53.620]  Yeah, this is my new one.
[00:53.900 --> 00:54.900]  I'm the I'm the new one.
[00:54.980 --> 00:56.100]  I've never been here before.
[00:56.240 --> 00:57.180]  Geoff has been here before.
[00:57.180 --> 00:58.180]  He's been to all of them.
[00:58.460 --> 01:00.740]  And and he's the only one who's all of them on time.
[01:01.080 --> 01:01.640]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01.640 --> 01:03.780]  Gavin showed up a little late for the third stream, but that's OK.
[01:05.700 --> 01:08.320]  I mean, he's like, I mean, shut up late and quiet.
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.820]  Yeah, it's not synced or anything.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.700]  I mean, like if he's recording, if he's even recording, you know what I mean?
[01:13.120 --> 01:14.940]  Yeah. Gavin.
[01:15.060 --> 01:16.380]  Well, if the tail sync with him, I guess.
[01:16.500 --> 01:18.320]  Yeah, well, now we're at the tail sync. Oh, my God.
[01:20.180 --> 01:21.640]  Gavin. He just does.
[01:21.720 --> 01:22.720]  He doesn't have anything to say.
[01:22.860 --> 01:23.520]  He's going to leave.
[01:24.140 --> 01:25.380]  He has nothing to say for himself.
[01:25.380 --> 01:25.760]  Yeah.
[01:27.920 --> 01:29.720]  Gavin, it works.
[01:34.040 --> 01:37.200]  Any anything acknowledgment that you're alive?
[01:39.660 --> 01:40.660]  Gavin, OK.
[01:41.040 --> 01:42.020]  What? What?
[01:42.320 --> 01:44.880]  I'm just trying to see what your level is versus everybody else.
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.460]  Are you OK? Are you OK?
[01:48.820 --> 01:49.600]  Parking garage.
[01:50.620 --> 01:52.400]  Oh, how do I how do I kick Gavin?
[01:52.400 --> 01:55.740]  I. Well, let's get down there.
[01:56.960 --> 01:57.660]  Oh, man.
[01:57.880 --> 01:58.860]  So catch us up.
[01:58.920 --> 02:00.360]  Where do we leave off last time, Nick?
[02:00.560 --> 02:04.560]  So last time we got through that zombie infested upper area of City Hall
[02:04.560 --> 02:06.880]  where you died a bunch of where I died a lot.
[02:06.980 --> 02:09.600]  And my kid almost saw something horrific and. Yeah.
[02:11.540 --> 02:12.440]  Brought it on yourself.
[02:12.600 --> 02:14.820]  I just screaming, Oh, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look.
[02:14.860 --> 02:17.260]  As Ellie was getting her throat ripped out by a. Oh, my God.
[02:17.440 --> 02:21.200]  Yeah, he loves to run in here.
[02:23.100 --> 02:26.520]  So now we're in the basement and we're trying to get nice and quiet into.
[02:26.640 --> 02:28.260]  Yeah. No attention here.
[02:28.500 --> 02:32.400]  We need to get into the garage where we can get some gas so we can get this.
[02:33.260 --> 02:36.200]  Generate. Oh, that's the that's the pill you're supposed to take.
[02:36.840 --> 02:39.000]  Oh, yeah. Prep.
[02:40.100 --> 02:40.920]  Wasn't it? You take it.
[02:41.040 --> 02:42.300]  If you take it every day, you can't get.
[02:42.740 --> 02:43.740]  You learned about this.
[02:44.100 --> 02:44.980]  Yeah, no, I know.
[02:45.160 --> 02:46.300]  Oh, yeah, we. Yeah.
[02:47.260 --> 02:50.400]  I don't think that was probably in there, but yeah, we learned about it.
[02:50.400 --> 02:51.460]  It was pre-prep.
[02:51.540 --> 02:53.800]  I think the thing we watched in 1991.
[02:54.580 --> 02:57.160]  Yeah, probably hold off on doing any of that.
[02:57.420 --> 03:00.320]  It was a worldwide crisis where people are going, this might be the end of you.
[03:00.400 --> 03:01.360]  I don't know what we're going to.
[03:01.440 --> 03:03.580]  I don't. Yeah, I don't think prep was a thing.
[03:05.300 --> 03:07.560]  So what is grounded difficulty?
[03:08.420 --> 03:11.480]  So it's a difficulty that limits resources more.
[03:11.740 --> 03:12.640]  You don't get as much ammo.
[03:12.700 --> 03:14.000]  You can get as much crafting stuff.
[03:14.400 --> 03:18.340]  I'm not sure if you get like slightly different collectible numbers or not,
[03:18.340 --> 03:19.900]  like the things that you can upgrade equipment with.
[03:19.900 --> 03:22.620]  But the thing that you really don't, you can't do.
[03:22.880 --> 03:24.260]  I don't know if you ever played this game before.
[03:24.660 --> 03:28.100]  Yeah, it's an ability with like L1 or R1.
[03:28.260 --> 03:29.980]  Yeah, detective mode. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:30.100 --> 03:31.260]  The detective mode. Exactly.
[03:31.380 --> 03:33.180]  That's completely disabled. You don't have that.
[03:33.300 --> 03:34.940]  Oh, wow. That's crazy.
[03:35.240 --> 03:36.740]  Oh, yeah. That's an insane way to play this game.
[03:37.040 --> 03:37.700]  Oh, yeah. Not to me.
[03:37.740 --> 03:39.780]  A person who's never played it seems totally normal.
[03:40.480 --> 03:41.280]  Really fun.
[03:42.740 --> 03:44.840]  Like awesome game. Awesome story.
[03:45.120 --> 03:47.700]  What a blast to play through and everything.
[03:47.700 --> 03:52.580]  I can't stress enough how this game has zero replayability for me.
[03:52.580 --> 03:53.780]  Oh, really? I love it.
[03:53.840 --> 03:55.240]  I don't know why.
[03:55.580 --> 03:57.760]  I cannot, dude. I don't know.
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.960]  I can basically only play the Halo campaigns over again.
[04:03.100 --> 04:04.820]  Any other campaign, I just can't do it.
[04:04.940 --> 04:07.940]  If I've already know how the story is going to end, I just can't get into it.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.160]  Are you looking for the code for the safe?
[04:11.500 --> 04:13.940]  Yeah. 860722.
[04:14.400 --> 04:16.040]  Oh, really? 860722.
[04:16.040 --> 04:18.340]  Right behind you. Oh.
[04:19.720 --> 04:21.320]  On the whiteboard. I don't.
[04:26.240 --> 04:28.460]  860722, I believe, was what it was.
[04:28.880 --> 04:35.020]  OK, 860722.
[04:35.320 --> 04:36.540]  I think that's what it was.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.860]  Wow. I did not.
[04:38.940 --> 04:40.260]  I mean, it's on the giant whiteboard.
[04:40.920 --> 04:41.480]  Are you kidding?
[04:42.980 --> 04:44.740]  You've got to be kidding me, Nick.
[04:44.740 --> 04:45.760]  Oh my god. What was it?
[04:46.220 --> 04:48.300]  88. What? No.
[04:49.300 --> 04:52.040]  886026. No, 8621.
[04:53.200 --> 04:53.620]  88602.
[04:58.840 --> 04:59.260]  88070722.
[05:03.520 --> 05:03.940]  220207.
[05:03.940 --> 05:05.520]  Hey, Gavin's here. Hey, Gavin.
[05:05.800 --> 05:07.460]  Are you rolling in your audio?
[05:08.940 --> 05:09.740]  Yeah. OK.
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.260]  Hey, good call, guys. Nailed it.
[05:12.880 --> 05:14.120]  Well, yeah, it's written in.
[05:14.120 --> 05:19.100]  It's like so big written on that white, like the whiteboard back there.
[05:19.100 --> 05:20.040]  It's like gigantic.
[05:20.340 --> 05:23.160]  Actually, I'm going to make a mullet of cocktail because we're going to need that.
[05:23.780 --> 05:25.120]  And then who the fuck is calling my number?
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.240]  Oh, we're all here.
[05:27.900 --> 05:31.140]  Hey, it's Andrew. Hey, Andrew, what's the safe word?
[05:33.600 --> 05:36.800]  Can I craft a 250?
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.120]  I guess not.
[05:40.320 --> 05:42.660]  I, I really appreciate everyone in chat.
[05:42.760 --> 05:43.420]  Thanks for watching.
[05:43.420 --> 05:46.580]  Thanks for all the gifted subs, all the subs that are happening and everything.
[05:46.740 --> 05:48.180]  One guy asking, is this live?
[05:48.640 --> 05:50.260]  I don't know what to tell you, man.
[05:50.680 --> 05:51.600]  Read the newspaper.
[05:56.620 --> 05:58.280]  I had a good joke about that.
[05:58.980 --> 05:59.340]  Oh, yeah.
[05:59.700 --> 06:01.520]  Hit us with it. Yeah, let's hear it.
[06:01.820 --> 06:03.520]  I need an I'm not prepared.
[06:04.180 --> 06:06.200]  We were prepared to talk about it.
[06:06.300 --> 06:06.640]  Not prepared.
[06:06.980 --> 06:08.140]  What kind of set up do you need?
[06:08.320 --> 06:09.640]  I get I get to ask you whatever you want.
[06:09.780 --> 06:12.060]  You know, it was a podcast moment.
[06:12.940 --> 06:14.040]  Whole newspaper thing.
[06:14.080 --> 06:15.100]  I don't have one in front of me.
[06:15.940 --> 06:17.040]  Oh, I forgot.
[06:17.140 --> 06:19.580]  I forgot that we were a newspaper podcast for a minute.
[06:20.860 --> 06:22.160]  Zombie set up again.
[06:22.260 --> 06:23.120]  It's popping off.
[06:23.260 --> 06:24.300]  I forgot about it.
[06:25.180 --> 06:27.080]  You have like no ammo.
[06:27.320 --> 06:28.200]  How are you going to do this?
[06:28.780 --> 06:30.240]  Yeah, I missed two shots.
[06:31.140 --> 06:32.800]  Like she saved you.
[06:32.860 --> 06:33.280]  Oh, she did.
[06:33.740 --> 06:34.560]  Oh, you got slapped.
[06:34.840 --> 06:35.780]  Oh, you're not even flying.
[06:35.960 --> 06:36.620]  Now you're just dead.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.780]  No, he missed two shots.
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.680]  He needs to die.
[06:40.540 --> 06:42.040]  Bullets are more valuable than life.
[06:42.180 --> 06:43.920]  If he shoots all his life away, he might as well die.
[06:44.260 --> 06:49.000]  I don't know why we didn't edit this part out in the restream of what we're doing right here.
[06:49.120 --> 06:49.860]  Oh, it goes right to it.
[06:50.400 --> 06:54.620]  Does anybody feel like Gavin slowly started up and now he's fully revving?
[06:55.800 --> 06:58.500]  Like it was like a car, like an engine just taking a while to warm up.
[06:58.580 --> 06:59.800]  Yeah, I don't know why.
[06:59.960 --> 07:01.560]  We had like sputters of Gavin at first.
[07:01.640 --> 07:03.340]  And now he's like now he's in third gear and he's going.
[07:03.640 --> 07:05.640]  Yeah, he just he decided that he wants to play.
[07:05.700 --> 07:06.480]  So he's here, baby.
[07:07.120 --> 07:09.440]  I was swapping my headphone batteries.
[07:09.680 --> 07:14.360]  Oh, I don't really understand your audio situation.
[07:14.520 --> 07:17.900]  You have to like go to different like computers or something.
[07:18.000 --> 07:18.860]  Oh, big time.
[07:20.220 --> 07:21.180]  Oh, OK.
[07:21.420 --> 07:23.460]  And he's got a computer for his headphones.
[07:23.620 --> 07:24.980]  He's got a computer for his batteries.
[07:26.180 --> 07:31.960]  But also you we have a text chat that you could tell us that.
[07:32.740 --> 07:34.120]  Yeah, but it's my headphones.
[07:34.280 --> 07:38.080]  I could I could only hear what you're asking me as my little mumbles on my desk.
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.200]  What's the plan for a clicker when you don't have anything to fight it with a run?
[07:48.260 --> 07:49.280]  He does a lot of running.
[07:49.560 --> 07:50.620]  Oh, is that what this is?
[07:50.660 --> 07:51.560]  It's just mostly running.
[07:51.900 --> 07:55.360]  He also he'll die a lot too sometimes.
[07:55.920 --> 07:57.480]  Oh, fun. Oh, most of the time.
[07:57.560 --> 07:59.060]  But yeah, that seems to be a plan.
[08:00.360 --> 08:01.900]  Oh, so then what? What?
[08:02.040 --> 08:04.060]  Then I grabbed it. Oh, you got a little knife.
[08:04.200 --> 08:06.000]  Look at that. I did it. Oh, my God.
[08:06.060 --> 08:07.120]  I got a little knife.
[08:07.120 --> 08:09.480]  That was if if that was so baller.
[08:09.660 --> 08:13.080]  Yeah. If you didn't tell me anything about you dying a lot, you did it once
[08:13.080 --> 08:16.180]  just to have like conserved ammo and then you blew through that section
[08:16.180 --> 08:17.760]  with two clickers and a bunch of zombies.
[08:17.920 --> 08:20.180]  I don't like. Yeah, but yeah, that was kind of bad.
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.540]  Was a shit and piss.
[08:23.500 --> 08:25.500]  Who's that? The infected.
[08:26.220 --> 08:27.480]  I mean, I assume so.
[08:27.820 --> 08:28.960]  Probably their pants, though.
[08:31.980 --> 08:34.060]  No, no, these people were killing them.
[08:34.620 --> 08:36.300]  Yeah, it was just a load in their pants.
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.820]  Yeah, they all just have beauty butts.
[08:37.920 --> 08:39.120]  Yeah. Oh, no.
[08:39.600 --> 08:42.060]  They just it's just caked on urine.
[08:42.300 --> 08:46.760]  Yeah, they're covered in piss because they haven't showered in seven years.
[08:47.060 --> 08:49.820]  Yeah. I mean, like they're they're alive still.
[08:49.940 --> 08:52.740]  So like it's not like function cease. Right.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.260]  I guess not.
[08:55.400 --> 08:56.480]  But they're not dead.
[08:56.780 --> 08:59.680]  But do they not eat if they don't have people?
[08:59.740 --> 09:00.940]  They don't like chase animals.
[09:01.440 --> 09:04.940]  So maybe the plant sustains them through photosynthesis.
[09:04.940 --> 09:08.380]  Yeah. And then also, I don't know if that's how it works.
[09:09.200 --> 09:11.040]  Yeah, but I don't know. I don't know if that's a fungus works.
[09:11.840 --> 09:16.580]  I just assume that they they probably just, you know, shit, piss walking or whatever.
[09:16.980 --> 09:21.960]  And then the food isn't a super crucial thing.
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.160]  And they just if they starve and die, they starve and die.
[09:25.180 --> 09:26.460]  But that's kind of it.
[09:26.960 --> 09:29.580]  Yeah. You always read about that, like Yogi somewhere
[09:30.220 --> 09:33.420]  in some remote part of the world who hasn't eaten in like 37 years.
[09:33.420 --> 09:34.560]  And scientists are amazed.
[09:34.720 --> 09:36.520]  But he's still going strong, but he doesn't move.
[09:36.640 --> 09:39.540]  He just sits and stares straight ahead for 80 years. Yeah.
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.380]  OK, thanks for the level eight, level eight hype train that we have on.
[09:44.680 --> 09:46.320]  Oh, this is great.
[09:46.420 --> 09:48.740]  We be amazing. Thank you so much.
[09:49.080 --> 09:49.980]  Watching this later.
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.700]  We've been streaming these in October, every Thursday afternoon at 4 p.m.
[09:54.900 --> 09:57.940]  Yeah. Is taking us through last of us to until the 31st.
[09:57.940 --> 09:59.520]  Then we'll have on grounded mode.
[09:59.920 --> 10:00.940]  Yeah. Yeah.
[10:00.940 --> 10:03.380]  Which means we talked about this last time, Eric.
[10:03.500 --> 10:06.640]  At some point in the middle of this, we don't know when Nick's mom
[10:06.640 --> 10:08.780]  is going to make him take the trash out and he won't be able to pause.
[10:10.300 --> 10:11.320]  He's on restriction.
[10:11.720 --> 10:13.000]  Oh, man, that takes me back.
[10:13.060 --> 10:16.120]  But mom, I can't pause the game. Oh, yeah.
[10:19.120 --> 10:19.520]  Up on the.
[10:19.740 --> 10:22.200]  Oh, that's a pretty horse, right?
[10:22.440 --> 10:24.100]  Hey. Oh, Shimmer is its name.
[10:24.240 --> 10:24.760]  I called it.
[10:24.820 --> 10:27.340]  They put a they put a lot of work into their horse physics.
[10:27.760 --> 10:29.200]  Yeah. Big time, though.
[10:29.200 --> 10:31.980]  It's like like Red Dead, where it's got like horse balls and stuff, right?
[10:32.460 --> 10:34.780]  Yeah. Red Dead also had a lot of horse pooping.
[10:35.020 --> 10:36.660]  Yeah, there was there's like a real time.
[10:36.720 --> 10:38.840]  I think we'll look back and be like, horse physics were so important
[10:38.840 --> 10:39.580]  to so many people.
[10:39.820 --> 10:42.440]  I feel like I did a Metal Gear Solid video.
[10:42.880 --> 10:45.880]  What was that Metal Gear that was on Xbox where I like had the horse shit
[10:45.880 --> 10:48.200]  on somebody's head or something like a million years ago?
[10:48.680 --> 10:50.280]  Metal Gear Phantom Pain.
[10:50.740 --> 10:53.000]  Phantom Pain. Yeah, I do remember that vaguely.
[10:53.240 --> 10:53.540]  Shot on a guy?
[10:54.320 --> 10:55.200]  I think it might have been you.
[10:55.340 --> 10:57.320]  I don't remember. I do definitely remember us doing a video.
[10:57.320 --> 10:58.820]  It might have been you.
[10:59.680 --> 11:01.000]  Traveling in a ration truck?
[11:01.540 --> 11:03.020]  Phantom Pain soundtrack was awesome.
[11:03.480 --> 11:04.480]  I don't think I ever played Phantom Pain.
[11:05.080 --> 11:06.200]  Was that the most recent one?
[11:06.280 --> 11:07.940]  You can you can make your horse shit.
[11:08.320 --> 11:09.020]  Yeah. Yeah.
[11:09.140 --> 11:10.280]  Was that the open world one?
[11:10.920 --> 11:12.220]  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:12.500 --> 11:14.780]  Oh, Andrew, right before you got here, you missed it.
[11:14.820 --> 11:16.080]  We were talking about AIDS for a second.
[11:16.660 --> 11:17.380]  Oh, wow. Really?
[11:17.560 --> 11:18.200]  Made me think of you.
[11:19.060 --> 11:20.220]  Oh, thanks, man.
[11:20.800 --> 11:23.940]  Regulation viewer says, Gavin, did you mean your feast plate
[11:23.940 --> 11:26.640]  joke when Andrew was talking about the English toilet?
[11:27.860 --> 11:28.900]  Yeah. Did you? Yeah.
[11:28.940 --> 11:29.480]  Did you mean that?
[11:30.200 --> 11:31.980]  I meant it. I said the joke you made.
[11:32.200 --> 11:34.740]  Dude, I can't believe you meant your feast plate joke, dude.
[11:34.780 --> 11:35.340]  What the fuck?
[11:35.980 --> 11:36.680]  It's a pretty funny joke.
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.240]  You're supposed to save that for the end of the stream
[11:39.240 --> 11:41.340]  because we can't follow it.
[11:41.740 --> 11:42.200]  Too good.
[11:45.980 --> 11:46.740]  All right.
[11:47.340 --> 11:48.920]  We're off to the truck.
[11:49.760 --> 11:50.020]  Truck.
[11:50.540 --> 11:51.080]  Oh, nice.
[11:51.760 --> 11:51.920]  Really?
[11:52.600 --> 11:55.440]  That's all my wife would be left if you go to Target.
[11:57.580 --> 11:59.900]  I mean, I still meant it whether they left it or not.
[12:01.760 --> 12:04.500]  I think I probably didn't hear it in the moment and found out about it later.
[12:04.640 --> 12:07.260]  I'm willing to bet I had to cut it and move it back
[12:08.140 --> 12:10.680]  because it was said over someone else or under someone else.
[12:11.180 --> 12:11.720]  Oh, there you go.
[12:12.140 --> 12:14.700]  You're fixing my timing.
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.220]  Yeah. Yeah, I'm helping.
[12:17.860 --> 12:18.740]  Want to make sure everybody hears the joke.
[12:18.740 --> 12:20.720]  That's why you're indispensable, Nick.
[12:20.940 --> 12:21.760]  Oh, thanks, man.
[12:22.200 --> 12:24.180]  Nick makes us sound funnier than we are.
[12:24.440 --> 12:26.820]  Except for Andrew, who wants to put a bullet between your eyes, apparently.
[12:27.400 --> 12:28.800]  Exactly how it was going to go.
[12:28.900 --> 12:30.180]  I told you, Andrew.
[12:30.560 --> 12:30.960]  I don't want to.
[12:31.400 --> 12:32.920]  Here's the person who's listening.
[12:33.320 --> 12:36.480]  I'm not the one that locked us in the room and said one of us had to die.
[12:37.280 --> 12:37.760]  That's true.
[12:37.780 --> 12:40.560]  I believe that was Geoff and Gavin did that.
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.180]  Wait, why am I?
[12:42.340 --> 12:44.560]  What part of that conversation?
[12:45.360 --> 12:46.460]  Right. I think it was me.
[12:46.680 --> 12:47.140]  My fault.
[12:48.660 --> 12:50.000]  I think if you try this.
[12:50.300 --> 12:51.560]  Oh, sorry.
[12:51.760 --> 12:52.000]  Go on.
[12:52.100 --> 12:53.000]  Where is nothing?
[12:53.300 --> 12:53.720]  There it is.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.060]  What gate are we at?
[12:56.060 --> 12:57.540]  I got that in my desk.
[12:57.700 --> 12:58.220]  Gate six.
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.040]  Hey, Gavin, do you think that a wolf could break through a sliding glass door?
[13:05.720 --> 13:06.340]  Oh, it's east.
[13:06.620 --> 13:07.460]  Talking double glazing?
[13:08.080 --> 13:08.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[13:08.960 --> 13:10.760]  Just, you know, like a nice home.
[13:11.040 --> 13:12.620]  And then there's like a wolf outside.
[13:12.980 --> 13:16.160]  And do you think he could break through the sliding glass door?
[13:16.320 --> 13:17.020]  I would bet not.
[13:17.660 --> 13:19.180]  OK, Nick said they could.
[13:19.600 --> 13:20.760]  Nah, I think so.
[13:20.800 --> 13:22.380]  Right. I'm thinking there's no way.
[13:23.880 --> 13:24.720]  Is the wolf thirsty?
[13:26.060 --> 13:26.900]  I think it's hungry.
[13:27.420 --> 13:29.380]  I don't think they're sharp enough.
[13:30.780 --> 13:33.800]  Is the wolf thirsty?
[13:34.400 --> 13:35.580]  If it was desperate.
[13:35.900 --> 13:40.240]  Like, the wolf is thirsty, so I put a Gatorade on the other side of the slide.
[13:40.240 --> 13:43.060]  You put a Gatorade on the other side, that wolf was fucking squirming through it.
[13:43.060 --> 13:48.620]  It's only course of action is to bash its wolf nose or its wolf head into the glass, right?
[13:48.700 --> 13:50.940]  Like, it's not going to be able to push it up, push through it.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.580]  Like, no, no, it would have to, like, jump as hard as it could into it, right?
[13:55.580 --> 14:01.320]  I have to feel like if a wolf wouldn't do that, because it would hurt too much.
[14:01.500 --> 14:03.180]  Yeah, I think it could physically do it.
[14:03.260 --> 14:06.340]  But the wolf would sustain such injury that it wouldn't be effective afterward.
[14:06.600 --> 14:08.520]  OK, but what if it was thirsty?
[14:10.180 --> 14:11.600]  What color is the Gatorade?
[14:12.320 --> 14:12.760]  Orange.
[14:13.780 --> 14:15.320]  No, the orange would not go.
[14:15.400 --> 14:16.680]  No, he wouldn't go for an orange Gatorade.
[14:17.040 --> 14:19.340]  It would have to be blue or light blue.
[14:19.340 --> 14:22.060]  If it's blue Gatorade, if it's blue raspberry specifically.
[14:22.300 --> 14:23.100]  Yeah, it's going right through.
[14:24.180 --> 14:27.420]  Eric, what would help you get through the door if it was on the other side of the glass?
[14:27.540 --> 14:28.960]  Uh, boy, that's tough.
[14:29.620 --> 14:30.400]  Oh, we got company.
[14:30.960 --> 14:32.160]  Oh, nice shot, Dina.
[14:33.080 --> 14:34.220]  Have her keep doing that.
[14:35.740 --> 14:36.400]  That's my plan.
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.220]  You keep liver-stabbing these dudes, but you really should go for the head.
[14:41.140 --> 14:43.060]  Oh, boy. Oh, God, Dina, get out of the fucking way.
[14:43.560 --> 14:44.940]  She would have shot you in the ear.
[14:50.360 --> 14:51.020]  Slice him up.
[14:51.540 --> 14:53.600]  There you go.
[14:53.660 --> 14:54.960]  There we go, there we go, there we go.
[14:56.480 --> 15:00.580]  The structural integrity of the glass door, I don't know, because of movies.
[15:01.080 --> 15:07.840]  I feel like I've seen glass doors break so easily in film, and I don't know how terrible they actually are.
[15:08.100 --> 15:15.260]  That reminds me, Andrew, you and I talked one time about an idea to do a draft of things that happen in movies that never happen in real life.
[15:15.260 --> 15:18.080]  Oh, that's such a good one. That's a good fucking draft.
[15:18.320 --> 15:19.900]  I made a whole fucking list.
[15:19.900 --> 15:21.580]  I got about 25 of them on there.
[15:22.780 --> 15:23.900]  That's a great one.
[15:24.100 --> 15:25.620]  Getting thrown through glass windows.
[15:26.260 --> 15:28.400]  I've already got half my list if we do this.
[15:28.520 --> 15:29.620]  Dude, this is great.
[15:29.840 --> 15:30.900]  Let's put that on the books.
[15:32.660 --> 15:34.400]  I'm going to make a spreadsheet.
[15:34.840 --> 15:38.260]  I'm going to put it on the calendar for next week.
[15:39.360 --> 15:41.080]  Man, we're rocking, man.
[15:41.780 --> 15:43.120]  You guys want to try for it on...
[15:43.120 --> 15:43.520]  Ooh, a rifle.
[15:44.560 --> 15:46.080]  You guys want to try for it on Monday?
[15:46.540 --> 15:47.220]  Right after our sync?
[15:47.900 --> 15:48.340]  Sure.
[15:51.100 --> 15:51.840]  I love it.
[15:52.460 --> 15:53.440]  Let's do it.
[15:53.540 --> 15:54.980]  Impossible movie things draft?
[15:55.200 --> 15:56.360]  Yeah, things that only happen in movies.
[15:56.820 --> 15:57.840]  I love it.
[16:00.060 --> 16:06.100]  Everyone who's watching this and listening to it, what you just heard is how we come up with so much of this.
[16:06.180 --> 16:12.600]  Where one person says something, the conversation snowballs and it eventually turns into, oh, what if we did this?
[16:12.820 --> 16:13.420]  And that's it.
[16:13.600 --> 16:15.320]  Where a company built on...
[16:16.680 --> 16:17.760]  It's just that.
[16:17.960 --> 16:20.540]  Didn't we talk about this a long time ago?
[16:21.440 --> 16:22.240]  Oh, yeah.
[16:23.760 --> 16:25.740]  It's in the calendar for next week.
[16:26.020 --> 16:26.660]  That's awesome, dude.
[16:26.780 --> 16:29.720]  We should rename this the hanging Chad podcast.
[16:30.200 --> 16:32.060]  Uh-oh.
[16:32.900 --> 16:33.180]  Uh-oh.
[16:34.060 --> 16:34.440]  Uh-oh.
[16:35.300 --> 16:35.820]  Uh-oh.
[16:36.740 --> 16:38.220]  Uh-oh.
[16:43.760 --> 16:44.460]  Uh-oh.
[16:45.060 --> 16:45.180]  Uh-oh.
[16:45.300 --> 16:45.360]  Oh.
[16:47.740 --> 16:48.920]  Or just me.
[16:49.800 --> 16:50.320]  That was weird.
[16:50.860 --> 16:51.520]  Was that just Geoff?
[16:53.600 --> 16:54.080]  Geoff?
[16:55.960 --> 16:56.340]  Yeah.
[16:58.340 --> 16:58.820]  Yeah.
[16:59.800 --> 17:00.420]  Uh-oh.
[17:03.040 --> 17:04.000]  Uh-oh.
[17:04.440 --> 17:04.840]  To me.
[17:05.280 --> 17:05.660]  It's not me.
[17:05.820 --> 17:07.000]  It might be me.
[17:07.100 --> 17:07.460]  It's not Geoff.
[17:07.560 --> 17:07.840]  It's not Geoff.
[17:09.720 --> 17:10.340]  Geoff...
[17:12.460 --> 17:13.080]  Hard...
[17:13.080 --> 17:13.880]  Wired in.
[17:14.660 --> 17:15.120]  I'm hardwired.
[17:17.140 --> 17:18.380]  Uh-oh.
[17:18.800 --> 17:19.680]  Hold on.
[17:20.920 --> 17:21.580]  It might be me.
[17:22.360 --> 17:22.740]  Am I back?
[17:23.240 --> 17:24.560]  It might be Discord.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.600]  I'm hardwired in now.
[17:29.920 --> 17:32.800]  Even my Twitch chat is sucked off the screen.
[17:33.200 --> 17:33.380]  Yes.
[17:35.940 --> 17:37.140]  Maybe it's Milton.
[17:37.140 --> 17:38.200]  I don't think so.
[17:39.920 --> 17:40.460]  I think it's Discord.
[17:40.760 --> 17:41.780]  You guys still there?
[17:43.400 --> 17:44.820]  Are we haunted?
[17:45.020 --> 17:46.460]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[17:47.260 --> 17:50.000]  I assure you, most things I do...
[17:50.000 --> 17:50.600]  I do do?
[17:50.840 --> 17:51.860]  I don't do it.
[17:55.720 --> 17:56.960]  It's like in 2024.
[17:57.300 --> 17:58.540]  It's still hard to do this job.
[18:02.890 --> 18:03.410]  Uh...
[18:03.410 --> 18:04.270]  Uh-oh.
[18:05.570 --> 18:07.170]  Do I need to reboot?
[18:08.510 --> 18:10.090]  Can you hear me? I can hear you.
[18:11.450 --> 18:12.690]  That's gotta be Discord, huh?
[18:14.250 --> 18:15.750]  I don't recognize this one either.
[18:17.310 --> 18:20.170]  I don't know if we should leave and come back.
[18:20.870 --> 18:21.570]  Or fuck up the room.
[18:22.890 --> 18:23.630]  Nah, I'll be alright.
[18:23.910 --> 18:25.530]  Gavin sounds fine to me, by the way.
[18:28.930 --> 18:30.490]  It's Nick and Eric that sound weird.
[18:30.510 --> 18:31.170]  Do I sound fine?
[18:32.370 --> 18:32.730]  Okay.
[18:32.910 --> 18:34.990]  You sound fine to me the whole time.
[18:34.990 --> 18:37.170]  Okay, so...
[18:37.170 --> 18:38.470]  Am I coming through clear?
[18:38.810 --> 18:40.530]  Yeah, you sound great.
[18:40.710 --> 18:42.890]  So, I disconnected and reconnected.
[18:43.050 --> 18:45.190]  It took a long time to reconnect.
[18:47.250 --> 18:48.330]  I believe...
[18:48.330 --> 18:49.530]  I mean, you sound fine now.
[18:50.110 --> 18:53.650]  It looks like a Discord issue.
[18:56.070 --> 18:57.270]  So, I don't know.
[18:57.370 --> 18:58.190]  That was super weird.
[19:00.330 --> 19:02.470]  Discord got really excited about our draft.
[19:02.830 --> 19:03.130]  What the fuck?
[19:03.850 --> 19:04.790]  Shut it down!
[19:06.730 --> 19:08.010]  Terrible bathroom design.
[19:08.210 --> 19:09.070]  Your Twitch got weird?
[19:09.310 --> 19:09.870]  What's wrong with your Twitch?
[19:10.930 --> 19:13.450]  The chat kept getting higher and higher
[19:13.450 --> 19:15.110]  up the screen until it was gone.
[19:15.530 --> 19:15.970]  What?
[19:17.650 --> 19:19.290]  My only issue is Discord.
[19:19.430 --> 19:21.470]  I did a speed test and I had a gig down.
[19:23.190 --> 19:24.770]  Like, I'm good.
[19:25.230 --> 19:27.030]  I did a speed test and I'm fine as well.
[19:27.530 --> 19:29.530]  There was a big solar flare recently.
[19:30.230 --> 19:31.690]  According to Shuts67.
[19:31.690 --> 19:33.450]  Maybe we got solar flared there for a second.
[19:33.670 --> 19:35.190]  I don't believe that.
[19:35.330 --> 19:37.290]  I don't believe in the sun or its power.
[19:40.050 --> 19:41.710]  I'm strictly a moon guy.
[19:42.610 --> 19:43.370]  Yeah, I was going to say.
[19:44.810 --> 19:46.270]  You get a tan off the moon.
[19:46.270 --> 19:47.270]  What was the thing?
[19:47.810 --> 19:49.070]  Didn't Bernie say in the podcast
[19:49.070 --> 19:52.550]  something about you get a sunburn from a fire or something?
[19:56.550 --> 19:57.930]  You get a burn.
[19:58.250 --> 19:59.210]  You get a regular burn.
[20:02.790 --> 20:04.310]  How about that, dude?
[20:05.030 --> 20:05.810]  Oh, Tommy did this.
[20:09.030 --> 20:10.230]  Tommy is...
[20:10.230 --> 20:12.450]  Tommy's the brother of...
[20:12.450 --> 20:13.090]  Joel.
[20:16.590 --> 20:18.610]  That's how I felt after the pencil trial.
[20:21.230 --> 20:22.510]  Are you skipping
[20:22.510 --> 20:23.310]  the cutscenes?
[20:25.330 --> 20:25.930]  That's...
[20:25.930 --> 20:28.190]  This is the funniest way to play this game.
[20:28.670 --> 20:29.610]  This is...
[20:29.610 --> 20:32.650]  He only made us watch one cutscene
[20:32.650 --> 20:33.350]  that was really sad.
[20:33.350 --> 20:36.390]  This is truly a psychopath's delight.
[20:36.910 --> 20:38.090]  Alright, we'll watch the rest of them.
[20:38.170 --> 20:40.630]  No, no, no. I don't want you to watch them.
[20:40.890 --> 20:43.090]  I just want to remark on
[20:43.090 --> 20:44.750]  that's the craziest way
[20:44.750 --> 20:46.290]  to play this game.
[20:46.750 --> 20:48.370]  Yeah, I want to play it since the most...
[20:48.370 --> 20:49.310]  You've already played it.
[20:49.450 --> 20:52.690]  But I'm saying that it's the most realistic way
[20:53.690 --> 20:54.490]  violence-wise
[20:54.490 --> 20:56.430]  and survival-wise to play it
[20:56.430 --> 20:58.550]  and then you go, I don't give a fuck what you have to say.
[20:59.330 --> 21:01.110]  Let me hit the next guy with that camera.
[21:01.110 --> 21:03.270]  It's more so we can just get through some stuff.
[21:03.990 --> 21:05.450]  I'll give background
[21:05.450 --> 21:05.950]  and explain.
[21:05.950 --> 21:08.050]  No, no, you skip it. You're good, dude.
[21:08.250 --> 21:09.210]  I feel like I'm not.
[21:09.610 --> 21:13.070]  I would like some background, Nick. Hit me up with a little bit of background.
[21:13.190 --> 21:13.730]  What's going on here?
[21:13.870 --> 21:15.710]  So right there, we just found out that
[21:17.910 --> 21:19.330]  Tommy was torturing those dudes
[21:19.330 --> 21:19.990]  for information.
[21:21.150 --> 21:21.510]  Okay.
[21:22.690 --> 21:25.310]  I think there was a photo of a couple of the people who were involved
[21:25.310 --> 21:27.490]  in Joel's death and so there's a location
[21:27.490 --> 21:28.910]  we're going to go check out now.
[21:29.770 --> 21:30.130]  Nice.
[21:30.390 --> 21:34.590]  This whole game is a revenge
[21:34.590 --> 21:35.430]  mission, essentially.
[21:36.190 --> 21:38.330]  Wait, do I need a code for this?
[21:38.330 --> 21:38.570]  I love that.
[21:39.790 --> 21:40.210]  Oh, okay.
[21:44.050 --> 21:44.810]  Here we go.
[21:45.950 --> 21:46.990]  Hey, so what are we streaming tomorrow?
[21:50.430 --> 21:51.610]  There's only four of us now, right?
[21:51.810 --> 21:52.050]  Uh-huh.
[21:53.930 --> 21:55.430]  So we're going to give it a shot?
[21:55.430 --> 21:57.730]  I feel like we committed to it.
[21:58.190 --> 21:58.590]  Okay.
[21:59.830 --> 22:01.510]  Yeah, I mean, we tweeted about it.
[22:02.150 --> 22:04.090]  We made social posts about it.
[22:04.130 --> 22:06.130]  What are we going to do after three minutes of Nick?
[22:09.430 --> 22:10.930]  Dude, 60 to 57
[22:10.930 --> 22:12.450]  is going to be tough without this guy.
[22:14.910 --> 22:16.410]  Who am I supposed to look at
[22:16.410 --> 22:18.450]  and go, why did you position yourself
[22:18.450 --> 22:19.310]  there? What are you doing?
[22:20.850 --> 22:21.770]  Who's going to go?
[22:23.490 --> 22:24.610]  Guys, I blew up
[22:24.610 --> 22:26.150]  so we can all go, where are you?
[22:31.210 --> 22:33.250]  That's what happens when
[22:33.250 --> 22:34.810]  Nick plays Gra, it's tough.
[22:35.710 --> 22:37.450]  Yeah, but we're all on the other side of the map
[22:37.450 --> 22:38.090]  hunkered down.
[22:41.470 --> 22:43.090]  Why are you skipping this?
[22:43.610 --> 22:45.990]  Shadow, mystery, or flicker, or whatever it was.
[22:46.050 --> 22:47.530]  It's short. Also, I have to do it
[22:47.530 --> 22:48.010]  because I'm playing.
[22:49.270 --> 22:50.990]  I think the horse would have shaken that off.
[22:51.050 --> 22:51.650]  Yeah, I think so too.
[22:53.290 --> 22:54.630]  Do you think he paid a thousand dollars
[22:54.630 --> 22:55.770]  to do that?
[22:58.670 --> 23:00.710]  Yeah, that's how Regulation Podcast started, right?
[23:01.030 --> 23:02.710]  Yeah, if that guy just stepped through a portal
[23:02.710 --> 23:04.230]  back to the future, that would have been awesome.
[23:05.490 --> 23:06.710]  So my work here is done,
[23:06.810 --> 23:07.230]  Mr. Reed.
[23:10.590 --> 23:12.810]  He's one of the dudes who did it.
[23:14.490 --> 23:16.090]  Ellie hit him with a knife.
[23:18.950 --> 23:20.450]  Usually when you hit somebody with a knife,
[23:20.450 --> 23:21.470]  they call that a stab.
[23:21.850 --> 23:22.770]  No, it was a slash.
[23:28.490 --> 23:30.270]  End of the game, right here.
[23:30.590 --> 23:32.910]  You can watch this scene in the show
[23:32.910 --> 23:34.630]  and say it was better in Nick's stream.
[23:38.630 --> 23:39.590]  Nick is low.
[23:42.130 --> 23:43.390]  Nick is so quiet.
[23:43.750 --> 23:45.790]  Why would you ever read, don't read the chat?
[23:46.650 --> 23:48.650]  First time chatter sausage tits said.
[23:49.510 --> 23:50.810]  What's up, sausage tits?
[23:55.650 --> 23:57.830]  Is there a really simple clue to sausage tits?
[23:58.150 --> 24:00.010]  Sausage tits X, first time chatter.
[24:00.130 --> 24:00.850]  Say what up!
[24:01.650 --> 24:02.210]  Like that.
[24:04.870 --> 24:07.310]  That should be better now. We should be more even across the board,
[24:07.370 --> 24:08.470]  but if we're not, let me know.
[24:08.730 --> 24:09.770]  We got a new mandate.
[24:13.510 --> 24:14.870]  Anyway, the game ends right here.
[24:15.230 --> 24:15.890]  And cut to black.
[24:19.770 --> 24:21.990]  I hope they don't kill the horse in the show,
[24:22.670 --> 24:24.050]  says Vervain and Wolfsbane.
[24:24.210 --> 24:25.550]  I bet they kill it twice.
[24:27.090 --> 24:27.850]  Chocking off.
[24:28.310 --> 24:28.870]  Need coverage.
[24:29.750 --> 24:30.630]  There you go, chocking off.
[24:31.590 --> 24:33.030]  Somebody asked in the chat,
[24:33.370 --> 24:34.230]  I gotta respond to this.
[24:34.650 --> 24:36.290]  Super B Will asked,
[24:36.470 --> 24:38.910]  Geoff, do you have a favorite way to consume water?
[24:39.370 --> 24:41.050]  I like to consume it orally.
[24:45.850 --> 24:48.050]  People in, like, chat
[24:48.050 --> 24:50.650]  on Twitch is nuts because it's people saying whatever
[24:50.650 --> 24:53.150]  the fuck they want, however they want
[24:53.150 --> 24:54.930]  for no reason
[24:54.930 --> 24:56.530]  with no preface.
[24:57.010 --> 24:58.350]  That's insane.
[24:58.650 --> 24:59.690]  I turn mine up a little.
[25:00.370 --> 25:03.190]  Of all the whole water in the same way that a wolf does.
[25:03.550 --> 25:03.970]  Whoa!
[25:04.950 --> 25:07.710]  Geoff, could you break through a sliding glass door
[25:07.710 --> 25:09.570]  if there was an orange Gatorade on the other side?
[25:09.650 --> 25:10.650]  Absolutely not.
[25:12.370 --> 25:14.310]  You put a blue Gatorade in there?
[25:14.690 --> 25:16.410]  You tell me that blue might be raspberry?
[25:16.410 --> 25:18.950]  I'm gonna risk my life to get through that door.
[25:21.130 --> 25:22.490]  Hey, she hit him with her knife.
[25:23.270 --> 25:24.490]  Video games are for kids.
[25:25.870 --> 25:27.190]  Hey, get your kid in here, Nick.
[25:27.530 --> 25:29.270]  Hit him with a knife again.
[25:30.330 --> 25:31.370]  Hit him with a gun.
[25:31.790 --> 25:33.470]  Double tap, double tap, double tap, double tap.
[25:33.570 --> 25:34.850]  Hit him with an immunity bullet.
[25:40.250 --> 25:41.410]  I've noticed in video games
[25:41.410 --> 25:43.170]  when you kill people, you never leave, like,
[25:43.190 --> 25:44.050]  a signature behind.
[25:44.810 --> 25:45.250]  What?
[25:45.650 --> 25:48.070]  Imagine if everyone that Ellie killed,
[25:48.590 --> 25:50.670]  she, like, cut their dick off
[25:50.670 --> 25:51.630]  and sewed it to their head.
[25:51.850 --> 25:55.370]  You think when you kill someone in a game
[25:55.370 --> 25:57.110]  it's a serial killer situation?
[25:57.350 --> 25:58.250]  That's a lot of work.
[25:58.530 --> 25:59.530]  No, I'm saying it's never that way.
[26:01.610 --> 26:02.050]  Okay.
[26:02.730 --> 26:03.810]  Because there's no signatures.
[26:04.310 --> 26:06.510]  I'm learning that Gavin is a minigame guy.
[26:09.490 --> 26:10.590]  You know what, Gavin? You're right.
[26:10.710 --> 26:11.690]  Video games aren't for kids.
[26:11.690 --> 26:13.150]  I see what you did to you.
[26:16.090 --> 26:17.450]  How can I do this?
[26:17.470 --> 26:18.190]  Come on, you can do it.
[26:18.410 --> 26:19.450]  You got this.
[26:20.790 --> 26:22.530]  Now, these guys aren't zombies, Nick.
[26:24.430 --> 26:25.070]  There you go.
[26:25.230 --> 26:25.810]  Oh, shit!
[26:26.150 --> 26:27.510]  Oh, you got shot in the arm.
[26:27.610 --> 26:29.210]  You can't do it that way.
[26:29.550 --> 26:30.390]  No, I sure can't.
[26:31.290 --> 26:32.370]  Alright, let's try that again.
[26:33.390 --> 26:35.990]  They call that a bullet beats brick, I think.
[26:40.130 --> 26:41.070]  Beat brick better.
[26:42.630 --> 26:46.010]  Can you throw the brick far to turn and sneak?
[26:46.230 --> 26:46.790]  Oh, maybe I can.
[26:47.270 --> 26:48.230]  That's not far enough.
[26:48.390 --> 26:50.330]  I don't think they bought that.
[26:50.950 --> 26:51.670]  Are you sure?
[26:52.210 --> 26:54.850]  If only that brick exploded like a grenade.
[26:56.970 --> 26:58.170]  Oh, you're going to get shot in the head.
[26:58.490 --> 26:58.750]  Oh, no!
[27:01.930 --> 27:02.370]  Nice!
[27:03.130 --> 27:03.590]  It's hammer time.
[27:03.610 --> 27:05.350]  That has to be such a shitty way to die.
[27:05.930 --> 27:07.330]  Getting hit with a knife?
[27:07.970 --> 27:09.610]  That was a hammer, Geoff.
[27:09.910 --> 27:11.070]  Getting hit with a hammer knife?
[27:11.850 --> 27:13.410]  You ever hit your thumb?
[27:13.530 --> 27:15.130]  Imagine if that was your head four times.
[27:15.950 --> 27:18.850]  I'd like to believe after the first couple, it wouldn't matter anymore.
[27:19.210 --> 27:20.190]  Oh, God.
[27:20.610 --> 27:21.710]  Just brutal.
[27:24.010 --> 27:25.670]  We got to see if there's anything worth stealing.
[27:25.810 --> 27:27.850]  Speaking of brutal, anybody watch UFC last weekend?
[27:28.390 --> 27:28.670]  No.
[27:29.170 --> 27:31.110]  Was it pretty good?
[27:31.930 --> 27:32.130]  Yeah.
[27:33.390 --> 27:35.430]  If you're a fan of gore, it was.
[27:36.150 --> 27:37.230]  That dude's dead.
[27:37.390 --> 27:39.210]  It felt like a Rocky fight.
[27:39.870 --> 27:40.150]  Cool.
[27:40.490 --> 27:42.030]  The Alex Pereira, Khalil Rountree one.
[27:42.250 --> 27:43.890]  Big dudes just swinging.
[27:44.370 --> 27:45.850]  That was very fun.
[27:46.370 --> 27:46.950]  That's pretty cool.
[27:47.570 --> 27:54.330]  Khalil Rountree, the surgery he had to get after the fight for his nose was really intense.
[27:54.750 --> 27:54.890]  Oh, really?
[27:54.890 --> 27:55.630]  That's awesome.
[27:56.230 --> 27:56.830]  Molotov!
[27:58.770 --> 27:59.370]  Well...
[27:59.370 --> 28:01.370]  They're not really bunched.
[28:03.010 --> 28:04.030]  They're no oats.
[28:04.210 --> 28:04.790]  You know what I'm saying?
[28:05.170 --> 28:06.530]  If you get Dina to herd them.
[28:07.350 --> 28:10.190]  Or she could just, you know, call attention to us.
[28:10.490 --> 28:11.050]  Flashlight on?
[28:12.490 --> 28:12.930]  Where?
[28:13.950 --> 28:15.890]  I don't understand what I'm looking at with the grass.
[28:16.050 --> 28:17.390]  It's like...
[28:18.810 --> 28:19.690]  Everything's grown...
[28:19.690 --> 28:22.090]  Oh, boy. Bad spot.
[28:22.790 --> 28:23.810]  It's okay. It's all right.
[28:24.430 --> 28:24.550]  Okay.
[28:25.610 --> 28:27.730]  Everything's grown over and they're just like wooden tables.
[28:28.910 --> 28:30.470]  It's like mildew and moss.
[28:31.410 --> 28:32.810]  Oh, I think he saw them.
[28:32.910 --> 28:33.730]  In the neck!
[28:34.050 --> 28:36.710]  I assume a bunch of shit fell through the roof like mud and that.
[28:37.070 --> 28:37.730]  On the table, too.
[28:40.270 --> 28:42.850]  It just looked like it was in sheets on one of them.
[28:43.030 --> 28:43.370]  It was weird.
[28:46.110 --> 28:48.090]  Should we try and have grass desks?
[28:49.150 --> 28:49.330]  No.
[28:50.630 --> 28:54.110]  Should you do a bricks only playthrough of this game?
[28:54.270 --> 28:54.410]  No.
[28:55.410 --> 28:56.070]  Grounded bricks?
[28:56.590 --> 28:57.310]  Grounded bricks.
[28:57.850 --> 29:00.230]  He's having a tough enough time with guns, dude.
[29:00.870 --> 29:01.190]  Yeah, dude.
[29:01.210 --> 29:03.910]  What if you did it on the lowest difficulty, though? I bet you could do it.
[29:05.390 --> 29:05.710]  Bricklayer?
[29:07.070 --> 29:07.910]  Bricklayer? That's pretty good.
[29:08.570 --> 29:09.890]  I'd only play with pipes if you pipelayer.
[29:11.290 --> 29:14.310]  Have you become that much of a lawn guy, Gavin, that you want a grass desk?
[29:17.070 --> 29:20.050]  Do you still do stuff with your lawn?
[29:20.190 --> 29:21.270]  What's up? What's your lawn update?
[29:23.950 --> 29:25.670]  I got a little bit out of hand.
[29:26.890 --> 29:28.550]  Oh, Jesus Christ!
[29:28.710 --> 29:29.150]  Oh, wow.
[29:29.630 --> 29:31.810]  When I went over the other day, it was cut well. It looked nice.
[29:33.130 --> 29:33.650]  It looked good.
[29:33.670 --> 29:35.450]  I just can't... I want to cut it shorter.
[29:36.210 --> 29:39.550]  But I can't take that much off because it'll fill all my bins up.
[29:39.790 --> 29:41.390]  I need to get one of those bags for lawns.
[29:41.410 --> 29:42.290]  Shoot him, Dina! Shoot him!
[29:43.110 --> 29:44.530]  Oh, there's three more. Excellent.
[29:45.170 --> 29:45.830]  Oh, there's a lot.
[29:46.350 --> 29:46.710]  Yeah.
[29:49.250 --> 29:50.310]  They brought the whole team.
[29:51.170 --> 29:52.330]  Well, you scattered them.
[29:52.330 --> 29:54.370]  That was an insane shot to take, my man.
[29:54.370 --> 29:56.410]  You missed 100% of the shots you don't take.
[29:56.910 --> 29:59.490]  I missed 100% of the shots you took.
[30:00.190 --> 30:00.390]  Yeah.
[30:01.350 --> 30:02.910]  Apparently, shots are a premium.
[30:06.690 --> 30:07.570]  That's awesome.
[30:07.930 --> 30:10.690]  There are better shots in this game than the last one.
[30:10.990 --> 30:12.410]  This is brutal.
[30:13.010 --> 30:15.010]  This is way harder than the Zombs.
[30:16.070 --> 30:17.030]  Oh, why did I do that?
[30:17.950 --> 30:18.930]  Yeah, I'll just die.
[30:22.270 --> 30:25.270]  What did you think of the story in this one compared to the first one, Nick?
[30:25.350 --> 30:26.730]  Not as good, but still enjoyable.
[30:27.090 --> 30:28.190]  The gameplay is a lot better.
[30:28.710 --> 30:30.730]  I felt the same way.
[30:31.150 --> 30:34.190]  I think the game was trying to have a lot to say.
[30:34.730 --> 30:36.070]  Like, wow, all of these people.
[30:36.470 --> 30:37.050]  The stories.
[30:37.170 --> 30:37.950]  The people you have to kill.
[30:38.050 --> 30:40.250]  There's so many spots where you can't not kill the people.
[30:40.590 --> 30:40.830]  Oh, I know.
[30:41.690 --> 30:42.110]  Oh, okay.
[30:42.210 --> 30:44.490]  So what point are you making?
[30:44.710 --> 30:46.530]  That I have to kill them?
[30:46.710 --> 30:47.590]  I don't want to do that.
[30:47.590 --> 30:49.250]  And then there's like a bit with dogs later.
[30:49.370 --> 30:50.370]  It's like, I don't want to do that.
[30:50.510 --> 30:50.990]  It's the worst.
[30:55.310 --> 30:56.670]  There's a pumpkin on the desk.
[30:57.530 --> 30:58.890]  Oh yeah, the world ended around Halloween.
[30:59.430 --> 31:01.290]  Can you pick up a pumpkin and drop it on...
[31:01.290 --> 31:02.710]  There's no way those pumpkins are still alive.
[31:03.530 --> 31:03.930]  They're plastic.
[31:05.510 --> 31:06.670]  What the fuck?
[31:08.370 --> 31:12.070]  I can't wait to make a compilation of Nick getting murked in the head.
[31:14.230 --> 31:17.230]  Can you stick a pumpkin on their head so they can't see?
[31:17.650 --> 31:18.230]  Like in...
[31:18.230 --> 31:18.990]  Oh, good riddance.
[31:18.990 --> 31:19.130]  Can you stick a pumpkin on their head so they can't see?
[31:19.850 --> 31:20.290]  Yeah.
[31:21.270 --> 31:22.970]  Shoot again, Dina, shoot again!
[31:24.370 --> 31:25.970]  Jeez, Dina, you reckless turd.
[31:26.090 --> 31:26.970]  Thank you.
[31:29.130 --> 31:30.350]  Can you get a twofer in this?
[31:31.330 --> 31:32.350]  Uh, I don't know.
[31:32.710 --> 31:34.270]  It's like Billy Zane in Sniper.
[31:34.590 --> 31:35.590]  Ah, Dina!
[31:36.630 --> 31:38.610]  Cover the leg! Cover the flank!
[31:40.010 --> 31:41.350]  Cover the flank, dammit.
[31:43.050 --> 31:43.830]  Cover the flank, dammit.
[31:43.890 --> 31:44.610]  Alright, fuck it.
[31:44.650 --> 31:45.310]  We're going full balls.
[31:47.090 --> 31:48.370]  Is that what full balls is?
[31:49.010 --> 31:49.530]  Yep.
[31:50.590 --> 31:52.230]  What's Billy Zane's best roll?
[31:52.950 --> 31:54.070]  Balls. Uh, the mummy.
[31:54.750 --> 31:54.990]  Titanic.
[31:57.550 --> 31:58.510]  Twin Peaks.
[31:59.270 --> 32:00.910]  Oh, the phantom!
[32:01.570 --> 32:02.090]  Zoolander.
[32:03.230 --> 32:04.530]  Ooh, Zoolander's good.
[32:04.970 --> 32:05.790]  He's really good in that.
[32:06.130 --> 32:07.250]  He was a bad guy in Titanic.
[32:07.590 --> 32:08.770]  I know, he was great!
[32:10.090 --> 32:12.470]  He's got that gun, that's so cool.
[32:12.470 --> 32:16.070]  He just shoots into the water and the water splashes all over him.
[32:16.910 --> 32:18.630]  It's a walk-off.
[32:18.850 --> 32:21.090]  They're just flanking the position, that's crazy.
[32:21.610 --> 32:24.090]  Has Billy Zane ever done a movie with Arnold Bosley?
[32:28.310 --> 32:28.790]  Alright.
[32:29.810 --> 32:34.870]  Would that be like a Timothy Olyphant, uh, Josh Duhamel thing?
[32:35.230 --> 32:36.190]  Like from ten years ago?
[32:36.670 --> 32:36.790]  Yeah.
[32:37.330 --> 32:39.910]  Bill Paxton, Bill Pullman type thing?
[32:40.890 --> 32:41.990]  I'd be so...
[32:41.990 --> 32:44.990]  If someone made a movie with all of those people in it...
[32:44.990 --> 32:45.310]  Oh!
[32:45.310 --> 32:47.290]  Fuck, dude.
[32:47.910 --> 32:49.490]  You gotta stop eating bullets.
[32:49.890 --> 32:51.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:51.410 --> 32:52.570]  I need to get to that bottle.
[32:53.570 --> 32:54.130]  I agree.
[32:54.830 --> 32:56.790]  You think drinking's gonna help you out with this?
[32:57.050 --> 32:58.130]  I'd like to believe it would.
[32:58.270 --> 33:00.450]  Let me tell you something, that's not the answer, buddy.
[33:01.270 --> 33:02.530]  I've been down this road, Nick.
[33:03.130 --> 33:04.290]  It doesn't end well.
[33:05.310 --> 33:07.510]  Has the video come out where Nick needed a piss
[33:07.510 --> 33:09.190]  and we suggested pissing in a bottle?
[33:09.430 --> 33:10.230]  See what I mean?
[33:11.070 --> 33:13.650]  Isn't it just like weird sheets of grass on that one?
[33:13.650 --> 33:14.610]  I don't know, it seems strange.
[33:14.790 --> 33:17.070]  It was the...
[33:18.550 --> 33:20.830]  The very long heist video.
[33:21.250 --> 33:21.650]  That we did.
[33:22.290 --> 33:23.170]  Oh, that's right.
[33:23.350 --> 33:26.450]  You thought we were trying to get you to chug a beer while you needed a piss.
[33:26.950 --> 33:27.890]  Yeah, so crazy.
[33:28.330 --> 33:29.150]  Which is nuts.
[33:29.510 --> 33:31.190]  Can you just go around them so they...
[33:31.190 --> 33:32.210]  Maybe, let's find out.
[33:32.930 --> 33:34.390]  You might be able to if you wait.
[33:35.170 --> 33:36.410]  Yeah, like they're moving on.
[33:36.930 --> 33:38.890]  Maybe, but this guy's really hanging out.
[33:38.970 --> 33:40.090]  Oh, shit. Hold on.
[33:40.090 --> 33:41.510]  It's okay, just don't...
[33:42.090 --> 33:43.430]  It's glass right there!
[33:43.570 --> 33:45.150]  You took one in the arm and the head.
[33:45.230 --> 33:46.150]  It's glass!
[33:46.690 --> 33:47.270]  That is glass.
[33:47.350 --> 33:51.910]  Your eyeball just became a lot of blood.
[33:52.150 --> 33:54.430]  I think you have the right idea going to the right,
[33:54.590 --> 33:55.870]  and I think you just need to be patient,
[33:56.010 --> 33:58.490]  find your spot, and move quietly
[33:58.490 --> 34:00.050]  in circles around these things.
[34:00.450 --> 34:01.430]  Take guys out one by one.
[34:01.550 --> 34:05.190]  I'm pretty sure you have to move quietly in a circle around the tables.
[34:05.410 --> 34:07.970]  I'm pretty sure Dina just engaged them, though.
[34:08.230 --> 34:08.550]  Yeah.
[34:08.550 --> 34:11.510]  Remember, the key to being grounded
[34:11.510 --> 34:13.350]  is getting away with doing stuff
[34:13.350 --> 34:14.390]  and not getting caught.
[34:15.210 --> 34:16.910]  That's a great point.
[34:18.870 --> 34:20.830]  Maybe crawl underneath that rug.
[34:21.450 --> 34:22.070]  Just wait it out.
[34:22.750 --> 34:23.950]  You hang out under the H.
[34:26.270 --> 34:28.270]  Helipolisage is going to the bank.
[34:33.450 --> 34:34.750]  Alright, good deal.
[34:34.970 --> 34:35.590]  I mean, that's cool.
[34:36.690 --> 34:37.930]  Cashing in his briefcase?
[34:37.930 --> 34:39.790]  What do you have to do in drama?
[34:39.930 --> 34:41.510]  Oh my god.
[34:41.770 --> 34:43.430]  I have a safety deposit box in mine.
[34:44.130 --> 34:45.690]  I gotta get to you sometimes.
[34:50.460 --> 34:51.440]  Just gotta be patient.
[34:52.400 --> 34:53.820]  Yeah, you're fine. Take your time.
[34:55.220 --> 34:56.260]  Alright, we're going to sit over here
[34:56.260 --> 34:57.480]  and we're going to wait it out.
[34:57.620 --> 34:58.400]  Can I go under this?
[35:00.100 --> 35:00.280]  Nope.
[35:00.480 --> 35:02.180]  I'm getting that groundness.
[35:04.140 --> 35:06.620]  IW2 said, great interaction with Jack, Gavin.
[35:09.080 --> 35:10.480]  Oh, Albert came to hang out.
[35:11.100 --> 35:12.920]  Have you ever been to the Isle of Wight?
[35:13.420 --> 35:14.800]  I have been to the Isle of Wight.
[35:16.360 --> 35:18.280]  I was there when Princess Diana died.
[35:19.600 --> 35:21.120]  Whoa, you were at the Isle of Wight
[35:21.120 --> 35:22.980]  the same time that I was watching
[35:22.980 --> 35:24.900]  Men in Black in theaters? That's pretty cool.
[35:25.720 --> 35:27.060]  You always remember where you were.
[35:27.440 --> 35:29.420]  I have no memory of where I was.
[35:30.260 --> 35:31.140]  When did that happen?
[35:32.420 --> 35:33.220]  98? 97?
[35:33.740 --> 35:34.800]  Yeah, around there.
[35:34.960 --> 35:36.280]  When was Men in Black in theaters?
[35:37.680 --> 35:38.800]  That feels like a 97.
[35:39.980 --> 35:40.800]  Nice shot, Mike.
[35:41.820 --> 35:43.060]  You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
[35:44.700 --> 35:46.620]  Can you pick up his ammo?
[35:47.320 --> 35:47.800]  There you go.
[35:48.280 --> 35:50.400]  He needs to wait it out.
[35:51.180 --> 35:53.200]  Do you have the confusion grenade or whatever?
[35:53.400 --> 35:54.140]  Yeah, he does.
[35:55.240 --> 35:55.580]  Hold on.
[35:55.720 --> 35:57.980]  I think you have to start it like that next time.
[35:58.180 --> 35:59.700]  You should go for the old stun and stab.
[36:00.100 --> 36:01.480]  Watch it, watch it, watch it.
[36:01.800 --> 36:02.960]  Oh, you're going to get one in the face!
[36:04.680 --> 36:05.720]  That's going in the compilation.
[36:05.860 --> 36:07.060]  You had it though, you had it though.
[36:07.060 --> 36:09.320]  You know what? These guys are getting toasted.
[36:10.940 --> 36:13.560]  Hey, bitches.
[36:14.360 --> 36:14.940]  Eat dicks.
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.280]  Now see, that's the kind of throw I was aiming for yesterday when I didn't quite make it.
[36:20.820 --> 36:21.760]  Neither did he.
[36:25.860 --> 36:27.260]  I missed all of them!
[36:27.320 --> 36:28.540]  There's so many of them!
[36:28.840 --> 36:30.400]  You might have hit one person.
[36:30.740 --> 36:31.580]  That was a dofa.
[36:33.160 --> 36:33.640]  Nice!
[36:33.640 --> 36:36.440]  That was very, very lucky.
[36:36.540 --> 36:37.500]  Did he drop his gun or anything?
[36:39.300 --> 36:40.380]  Is there a dude right here?
[36:41.160 --> 36:42.520]  I think so.
[36:44.960 --> 36:46.420]  Oh, you shot one!
[36:46.900 --> 36:47.180]  What?
[36:48.340 --> 36:49.020]  Disappearing act.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.500]  I was living...
[36:54.500 --> 36:57.860]  I tried to play Halo 2 on Lasso and it's just that first entryway.
[36:58.560 --> 36:59.620]  Yeah, this is kind of...
[37:00.540 --> 37:02.140]  I never played Halo 2.
[37:02.860 --> 37:04.160]  That entryway is a motherfucker.
[37:04.440 --> 37:06.980]  Eric, you and me, Lasso, Halo 2. When?
[37:07.860 --> 37:08.840]  I don't know, when do you want to do it?
[37:08.880 --> 37:09.260]  I don't know.
[37:11.540 --> 37:11.860]  Tomorrow.
[37:12.020 --> 37:12.840]  Nice shot!
[37:13.400 --> 37:13.720]  Oh!
[37:16.580 --> 37:17.500]  Medium good shot.
[37:18.480 --> 37:20.400]  Don't forget about your concussion grenade or whatever.
[37:20.600 --> 37:21.600]  We are getting pincered.
[37:22.980 --> 37:23.800]  Yeah, let's try it.
[37:24.580 --> 37:25.200]  Eat shit, dicks.
[37:26.820 --> 37:29.020]  I would have got it out there earlier.
[37:29.800 --> 37:30.640]  Yeah, don't worry, he missed.
[37:30.640 --> 37:31.740]  Nick has lost his mind.
[37:32.740 --> 37:33.720]  He's just pulling the trigger.
[37:33.780 --> 37:34.920]  He knows there's nothing left.
[37:35.480 --> 37:36.420]  He's gone feral.
[37:39.700 --> 37:41.580]  He knows there's nothing left on that run.
[37:41.700 --> 37:42.920]  So he's like, ah, just use it all.
[37:44.220 --> 37:44.780]  I live in England.
[37:47.340 --> 37:47.700]  Interesting.
[37:49.140 --> 37:50.160]  I woke up and I was like...
[37:50.160 --> 37:51.480]  You have nothing to do with it.
[37:52.720 --> 37:54.160]  Do you remember him crying that day?
[37:55.000 --> 37:55.500]  Oh yeah.
[37:55.680 --> 37:59.180]  I also remember waking up and being like, why the hell isn't Sonic the Hedgehog on TV right now?
[38:03.940 --> 38:04.980]  Eat shit.
[38:05.020 --> 38:05.840]  Good move!
[38:06.520 --> 38:08.880]  He got loose!
[38:10.240 --> 38:11.880]  I didn't know they could get loose!
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.360]  That's rough, man.
[38:21.500 --> 38:24.400]  That was a good method, I think.
[38:24.660 --> 38:28.520]  You're killing more dudes before they kill you every time in more impressive ways.
[38:28.640 --> 38:30.740]  I like it.
[38:30.920 --> 38:31.480]  Oh, you know what?
[38:31.860 --> 38:34.000]  We're gonna catch those two dickweeds off guard.
[38:34.320 --> 38:34.660]  Yeah.
[38:35.020 --> 38:35.720]  There you go!
[38:39.480 --> 38:39.860]  Well...
[38:40.680 --> 38:42.180]  A little too fast for you.
[38:42.640 --> 38:44.480]  Oh, you might have got him!
[38:44.600 --> 38:46.080]  Oh, I hear screaming. Sounds good.
[38:47.220 --> 38:48.440]  Could have been a stubbed toe.
[38:49.020 --> 38:49.320]  Good.
[38:51.940 --> 38:52.320]  Well...
[38:54.780 --> 38:56.520]  I caught you right in the spine on that one.
[38:56.520 --> 38:58.320]  Are you able to just run past them?
[38:59.240 --> 39:00.100]  Yeah, let's try it.
[39:00.120 --> 39:02.940]  Do you have to kill all these people?
[39:03.360 --> 39:03.620]  Yes.
[39:04.580 --> 39:06.660]  Because the next area is swarming with them, too.
[39:07.540 --> 39:08.880]  Have you guys played Space Marines?
[39:09.880 --> 39:10.240]  No.
[39:10.680 --> 39:11.400]  I hear that's good.
[39:12.040 --> 39:13.800]  I wonder if we should try that.
[39:14.240 --> 39:15.800]  Yeah, I think it does a lot of work.
[39:15.980 --> 39:16.280]  Dina!
[39:20.260 --> 39:20.960]  Big chat.
[39:21.200 --> 39:21.600]  You having fun?
[39:23.840 --> 39:24.920]  Nick's running out of steam.
[39:26.120 --> 39:29.320]  Alright, let's try this again.
[39:29.720 --> 39:32.660]  Oh, that was good.
[39:33.160 --> 39:33.820]  Got one of them.
[39:34.100 --> 39:38.460]  Would anyone mind if I registered an eggulatetreon.com?
[39:38.500 --> 39:40.140]  That is so many levels deep.
[39:40.620 --> 39:41.740]  Down the lore hole.
[39:42.220 --> 39:43.520]  Yeah, go ahead and register it,
[39:43.600 --> 39:45.220]  and then we'll forget about it by tomorrow.
[39:45.680 --> 39:47.140]  Yeah, sounds good.
[39:47.760 --> 39:48.980]  An eggulatetreon.
[39:50.200 --> 39:51.260]  Now that's bullshit.
[39:51.340 --> 39:52.200]  It's a rifle. Die.
[39:54.040 --> 39:54.760]  Like that!
[39:54.760 --> 39:56.540]  That's what happens when you get hit with a rifle.
[39:56.780 --> 39:58.640]  Hey guys, I want you to know I was good at the first game.
[39:58.740 --> 40:02.780]  I think you're probably good at this, too, but this is like an insane mode.
[40:03.180 --> 40:07.140]  I also think your method of approach here is crazy.
[40:08.360 --> 40:09.220]  Yeah, it is.
[40:09.700 --> 40:11.260]  Well, I deserve that.
[40:11.980 --> 40:15.040]  I think that you immediately need to get in the room to the right,
[40:15.200 --> 40:17.660]  you need to wait them out, and then take them on one by one.
[40:17.920 --> 40:21.820]  Yeah, you don't have the ammo to fight head-on.
[40:21.820 --> 40:26.260]  It's like you're trying to battle seven guys, and this is not how the game is built.
[40:26.540 --> 40:28.520]  If I had a brick, I would totally...
[40:28.520 --> 40:28.820]  Ah, shit.
[40:29.600 --> 40:31.180]  Why don't you just use a health pack?
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.620]  Why don't you just turn around and go home?
[40:35.620 --> 40:36.280]  Let's try that.
[40:36.500 --> 40:37.380]  Let's give up on the whole mission.
[40:37.380 --> 40:39.500]  Because now you can probably take more than one bullet.
[40:39.940 --> 40:40.400]  Oh, maybe.
[40:41.440 --> 40:43.580]  Alright, Dina, watch the other way.
[40:43.780 --> 40:44.320]  Watch the other way.
[40:44.720 --> 40:47.300]  Alright, Dina, you didn't watch the other fucking way!
[40:47.780 --> 40:48.740]  You didn't do anything.
[40:50.880 --> 40:51.320]  Alright.
[40:52.500 --> 40:53.160]  I'm gonna heal up.
[40:56.410 --> 40:57.170]  Alright, we'll heal.
[40:57.290 --> 40:58.630]  You know what, let's just wait right here.
[40:58.870 --> 41:00.190]  That person's gonna come this way.
[41:00.590 --> 41:01.150]  Dina shot him.
[41:02.670 --> 41:04.850]  I don't think this is the right place to...
[41:04.850 --> 41:06.030]  Oh, you got this, Nick.
[41:06.810 --> 41:07.510]  Dina shot him.
[41:08.370 --> 41:10.370]  It's real good, Dina. Good call.
[41:10.970 --> 41:11.430]  Great call.
[41:14.430 --> 41:14.870]  Nice!
[41:16.730 --> 41:19.430]  That person will think twice before fucking with you again.
[41:19.430 --> 41:21.130]  That person's not thinking anymore, ever.
[41:21.370 --> 41:22.410]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[41:22.950 --> 41:25.610]  Now, if Dina would watch our backs, that would be...
[41:25.610 --> 41:27.310]  It sounds like someone's on...
[41:28.050 --> 41:28.810]  Someone's right there.
[41:29.650 --> 41:30.770]  You can just stab that one.
[41:31.570 --> 41:31.930]  Oh!
[41:33.590 --> 41:36.290]  It looked like the bullet bounced into your eye.
[41:36.750 --> 41:39.790]  It went all the way around the world and came back.
[41:41.030 --> 41:42.530]  I think you're being too stationary.
[41:42.690 --> 41:43.550]  I think you need to be more mobile.
[41:43.750 --> 41:44.150]  Yeah, I agree.
[41:44.190 --> 41:46.290]  I think you really need to keep moving.
[41:46.290 --> 41:48.730]  I think you need to be more sneaky and stealthy.
[41:48.810 --> 41:52.550]  I think you need to stay away from the windows and just grab guys one by one and take them out.
[41:52.990 --> 41:57.350]  Or try to just get around them and move on without fighting them at all, if that's possible.
[41:58.250 --> 41:59.090]  Let's wait right here.
[41:59.090 --> 42:01.890]  I just think that the method you're using is like...
[42:01.890 --> 42:04.670]  You're waiting for so long, I just don't think it's going to work for you.
[42:05.010 --> 42:06.850]  I just need to see...
[42:06.850 --> 42:07.990]  Okay, they're both here.
[42:08.450 --> 42:09.530]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[42:09.710 --> 42:09.850]  It's rough.
[42:10.750 --> 42:13.850]  Dina, if you give my position away...
[42:13.850 --> 42:15.710]  I don't think she can, can she?
[42:16.190 --> 42:17.450]  I think you take this guy here.
[42:17.530 --> 42:19.510]  Grab him! Damn it!
[42:22.590 --> 42:23.390]  Oh no.
[42:24.250 --> 42:24.870]  Things are bad.
[42:24.890 --> 42:27.270]  You're right in the middle with people all around you.
[42:27.770 --> 42:28.850]  Yeah, I'm boned.
[42:31.530 --> 42:34.070]  I think if you would've grabbed that guy...
[42:34.070 --> 42:36.010]  I think you would've been on to something.
[42:36.170 --> 42:39.190]  Sort of grab that guy and move in that direction towards the exit.
[42:39.310 --> 42:40.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:40.630 --> 42:42.630]  It wouldn't let me grab him.
[42:42.670 --> 42:45.270]  I think you should go opening bip, then health.
[42:47.370 --> 42:50.290]  I don't think opening bip is getting you enough...
[42:50.290 --> 42:50.930]  I don't think so either.
[42:50.990 --> 42:51.610]  Here's what we're going to do.
[42:51.650 --> 42:52.550]  We're going to fall back.
[42:53.890 --> 42:55.850]  If it's checkpoint confidence.
[42:56.530 --> 42:57.010]  Shit.
[42:57.650 --> 43:00.910]  Thanks to GeorgeRRFartin for subscribing.
[43:01.610 --> 43:02.750]  I really appreciate it, man.
[43:03.310 --> 43:05.310]  I think I can get you this time.
[43:05.810 --> 43:06.750]  Watch, now get him.
[43:06.930 --> 43:07.090]  Here.
[43:07.090 --> 43:08.450]  It didn't let me grab him.
[43:08.710 --> 43:09.070]  Nice.
[43:11.110 --> 43:11.830]  Grab you.
[43:13.450 --> 43:13.810]  Oh.
[43:14.610 --> 43:15.610]  I'm really sorry.
[43:16.710 --> 43:18.090]  No, you got this, Nick.
[43:18.090 --> 43:18.790]  I got it.
[43:20.150 --> 43:22.730]  I've been in worse shit in God of War in my streams.
[43:23.190 --> 43:24.070]  You'll get it eventually.
[43:24.430 --> 43:25.850]  You need to get past this.
[43:26.030 --> 43:28.170]  I don't think you can stop at that first table.
[43:28.390 --> 43:29.730]  No, I gotta get to the second set of tables.
[43:30.390 --> 43:31.790]  You have to get to the second set of tables.
[43:33.010 --> 43:33.870]  I'm not going to make it.
[43:33.870 --> 43:35.010]  I don't think I'm going to make it this time.
[43:35.050 --> 43:36.230]  Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[43:37.570 --> 43:38.330]  You made it.
[43:38.570 --> 43:41.050]  Just made it.
[43:41.130 --> 43:42.370]  Oh shit, there's guys outside.
[43:44.250 --> 43:46.390]  This wasn't me telling you to go all the way through.
[43:46.590 --> 43:48.010]  It's just you need a different position.
[43:48.450 --> 43:50.770]  Take the door and run.
[43:51.710 --> 43:52.530]  Take the door and run.
[43:52.530 --> 43:53.270]  Where's that guy?
[43:53.590 --> 43:54.790]  He's supposed to be on this road.
[43:56.170 --> 43:57.210]  No, he's there.
[43:57.330 --> 43:58.730]  He's going to be on the other side of the blue.
[43:59.510 --> 44:00.150]  Oh no.
[44:00.530 --> 44:01.850]  You just spent too much time there.
[44:01.970 --> 44:03.610]  I think you could go all the way around like that.
[44:03.710 --> 44:05.390]  And then grab the guy that's through the door.
[44:05.630 --> 44:06.830]  And then just back away with it.
[44:07.270 --> 44:08.430]  Because he's the furthest guy.
[44:09.610 --> 44:12.030]  Yeah, do what Gavin said.
[44:12.550 --> 44:13.310]  But also heal.
[44:14.190 --> 44:14.710]  I'll get there.
[44:16.190 --> 44:17.250]  Also avoid getting shot.
[44:17.930 --> 44:18.830]  Yeah, I would like that.
[44:18.850 --> 44:19.790]  Or hit with a knife.
[44:20.230 --> 44:21.010]  I would also like that.
[44:27.090 --> 44:27.890]  There's George Washington.
[44:30.430 --> 44:31.550]  Okay, that person is looking.
[44:31.550 --> 44:32.530]  So I can't get there yet.
[44:32.550 --> 44:33.690]  There's two.
[44:33.790 --> 44:35.110]  I'm just going to wait for them.
[44:38.370 --> 44:40.450]  Come on, you can't see through the posters.
[44:40.590 --> 44:41.090]  That's bullshit.
[44:42.030 --> 44:42.470]  Alright, here we go.
[44:42.510 --> 44:43.430]  We're going to grab him.
[44:44.750 --> 44:45.850]  He's looking at you.
[44:47.270 --> 44:48.490]  I was already boned.
[44:48.510 --> 44:49.150]  He's going to get grabbed.
[44:50.930 --> 44:53.750]  You want to just try running out that way and see what happens.
[44:54.350 --> 44:54.650]  Okay.
[44:55.910 --> 44:57.430]  What if you get to that door,
[44:57.730 --> 44:59.470]  throw the concussion bomb or whatever,
[44:59.470 --> 45:00.950]  and just egg it.
[45:01.070 --> 45:02.190]  And then egg it.
[45:03.350 --> 45:04.710]  I like this idea.
[45:05.150 --> 45:05.710]  And egg it.
[45:12.620 --> 45:19.390]  Can I throw it through the window?
[45:20.330 --> 45:21.070]  That would be great.
[45:21.330 --> 45:24.310]  Of course, you change tactics.
[45:24.610 --> 45:25.350]  Just wait.
[45:25.950 --> 45:26.850]  Watch your left.
[45:28.530 --> 45:30.430]  Because that guy is going to be coming through.
[45:30.810 --> 45:31.090]  Dina.
[45:32.310 --> 45:33.370]  They're not going to see Dina.
[45:33.370 --> 45:33.830]  It doesn't matter.
[45:34.110 --> 45:34.830]  Watch your left.
[45:41.190 --> 45:42.410]  Just go around.
[45:42.810 --> 45:44.250]  Shut up.
[45:44.630 --> 45:45.370]  Back away.
[45:46.310 --> 45:46.750]  Keep going.
[45:48.550 --> 45:50.490]  He's going to break out.
[45:51.290 --> 45:52.470]  There you go.
[45:53.050 --> 45:53.810]  Alright, get out of there.
[45:54.710 --> 45:56.310]  There you go. We're out of here, dude.
[45:56.730 --> 45:58.110]  Yeah, but you've got to hit the deck here.
[45:59.210 --> 45:59.810]  There we go.
[46:02.070 --> 46:02.610]  Yeah.
[46:03.190 --> 46:03.470]  Checkpoint.
[46:03.690 --> 46:05.030]  It only gets crazier.
[46:06.010 --> 46:07.110]  Is this a checkpoint?
[46:07.510 --> 46:08.630]  I don't know.
[46:08.670 --> 46:11.710]  I remember this part being tough just in regular mode.
[46:12.050 --> 46:13.190]  Yeah, it is.
[46:14.230 --> 46:15.130]  You're doing good.
[46:20.410 --> 46:22.450]  You've done good work here, Nick.
[46:23.790 --> 46:25.310]  Oh, I think you might be in his path.
[46:25.510 --> 46:26.590]  I'm throwing stuff.
[46:29.810 --> 46:30.570]  Where is he going to put you?
[46:31.110 --> 46:31.530]  Back there.
[46:31.710 --> 46:34.230]  Yeah, it's going to put me right back where I was.
[46:37.170 --> 46:39.030]  I still think that's the move.
[46:39.190 --> 46:40.630]  Just going around all these people.
[46:42.310 --> 46:46.750]  Have you guys seen this Hollywood Reporter tweet?
[46:47.470 --> 46:48.230]  Is it about us?
[46:48.590 --> 46:50.690]  Hollywood Reporter, meet your new A-list.
[46:51.230 --> 46:54.250]  From staggeringly talented TikTokers to Instagram stars
[46:54.250 --> 46:55.690]  that we can't look away from.
[46:55.790 --> 46:58.750]  These are the names of who will and should be dominating the business.
[46:58.750 --> 47:01.490]  It's a bunch of TikTok people
[47:01.490 --> 47:04.350]  and people you've never really seen before.
[47:04.490 --> 47:05.770]  People maybe you've scrolled by.
[47:05.910 --> 47:06.590]  And then Rhett and Link.
[47:09.250 --> 47:13.590]  It is men and women in their early 20s
[47:13.590 --> 47:14.810]  and Rhett and Link.
[47:16.570 --> 47:17.890]  Master Rob, make the list.
[47:20.130 --> 47:22.010]  Hang on, I'm going left and right
[47:22.010 --> 47:24.010]  and see if Ask a Ninja is in here somewhere.
[47:28.750 --> 47:29.470]  That's insane.
[47:30.190 --> 47:31.950]  Is Gary Vee on the list?
[47:32.130 --> 47:34.190]  Yeah, no, like nuts.
[47:36.990 --> 47:38.770]  You took it in the chest.
[47:44.850 --> 47:45.970]  It's the new A-list.
[47:47.410 --> 47:48.990]  Overnight Sensations, Rhett and Link.
[47:49.190 --> 47:50.350]  Oh yeah, never heard of them
[47:50.350 --> 47:51.270]  before you just mentioned them.
[47:53.830 --> 47:55.170]  Maybe Night on Jupiter.
[47:58.110 --> 48:00.330]  Did Kids React make the list?
[48:03.030 --> 48:05.730]  Only Kids React, not teens or elders.
[48:06.030 --> 48:06.330]  Just kids.
[48:07.070 --> 48:09.450]  My kid was on Kids React, so that's the only one I care about.
[48:09.810 --> 48:11.990]  What do you think all the React girls are doing now?
[48:13.390 --> 48:14.670]  Probably reacting to stuff.
[48:15.010 --> 48:15.170]  Yeah.
[48:16.290 --> 48:17.250]  Will you move?
[48:19.130 --> 48:19.610]  Please?
[48:20.010 --> 48:20.610]  Get out of here.
[48:20.610 --> 48:21.930]  Oh.
[48:24.390 --> 48:25.630]  Oh my god!
[48:27.630 --> 48:28.750]  There's a pumpkin.
[48:28.950 --> 48:29.790]  No, back up.
[48:30.250 --> 48:30.970]  Back up.
[48:31.630 --> 48:33.050]  That was incredible.
[48:34.050 --> 48:34.790]  Better take him out.
[48:37.230 --> 48:39.570]  They were waiting.
[48:40.190 --> 48:41.470]  Oh, the Facilitator.
[48:41.870 --> 48:42.910]  Five gifted subs.
[48:42.910 --> 48:45.010]  Thank you so much.
[48:46.550 --> 48:48.270]  Do you think the Facilitator
[48:48.270 --> 48:50.090]  has read Celestial Gorbosus
[48:50.090 --> 48:51.210]  with all the facilitation?
[48:51.750 --> 48:54.310]  My wife read a book for her show
[48:54.310 --> 48:56.310]  the other day and told me it was worse than reading
[48:56.310 --> 48:57.790]  Celestial Gorbosus.
[48:58.210 --> 48:58.710]  There you go.
[48:58.870 --> 49:00.470]  A ringing endorsement.
[49:06.430 --> 49:08.130]  There you go. You're good.
[49:08.350 --> 49:09.450]  Oh, you shouldn't have run. You had it.
[49:09.770 --> 49:10.730]  Just keep running.
[49:12.210 --> 49:13.590]  Hit the fucking deck.
[49:14.690 --> 49:15.530]  Hit the grass.
[49:15.530 --> 49:17.350]  Touch grass.
[49:18.010 --> 49:19.310]  What are you doing?
[49:19.690 --> 49:20.490]  Shoot in.
[49:22.010 --> 49:23.310]  You had it.
[49:23.410 --> 49:24.130]  You panicked.
[49:24.670 --> 49:26.610]  Why did you just stand there?
[49:26.650 --> 49:27.170]  I panicked.
[49:28.830 --> 49:31.110]  You got 11 minutes, Nick. It's almost 5-0-1.
[49:33.030 --> 49:34.930]  We gotta get through this section today, right?
[49:35.510 --> 49:37.550]  Somebody asked if I'll be playing any spooky games.
[49:37.690 --> 49:38.710]  We played Left 4 Dead,
[49:39.190 --> 49:41.490]  and we played Outlast Trials,
[49:41.850 --> 49:43.870]  and this is pretty spooky.
[49:43.870 --> 49:46.230]  How spooky is Ghost Recon?
[49:46.990 --> 49:48.670]  It's got the word ghost in the title.
[49:50.070 --> 49:52.510]  Dude, I love that we have been making
[49:52.510 --> 49:54.610]  references to a video we recorded yesterday
[49:54.610 --> 49:56.470]  that won't come out for a couple of months, probably.
[49:57.370 --> 49:58.650]  The audience has no idea.
[49:58.750 --> 49:59.690]  We're doing callbacks to something
[49:59.690 --> 50:01.050]  that they don't know about for two more months.
[50:01.570 --> 50:03.090]  Nick, I think you gotta throw that back
[50:03.090 --> 50:05.510]  to see if you can get people, like, outta here.
[50:05.910 --> 50:07.390]  Oh, that's not a bad idea.
[50:09.450 --> 50:12.390]  I mean, that's absolutely...
[50:12.390 --> 50:13.850]  I mean, that's absolutely the...
[50:13.850 --> 50:15.330]  I don't know what to say, man. That was nuts.
[50:15.790 --> 50:16.630]  What are you talking about?
[50:17.350 --> 50:19.390]  Where are you decided to throw that?
[50:20.830 --> 50:23.490]  He's just, like, a lateral, and I don't understand why.
[50:25.730 --> 50:27.630]  Somebody in the Spummer,
[50:27.830 --> 50:29.230]  actually, Spummer underscore RP,
[50:29.630 --> 50:31.770]  said, gentle Ghost Recon, which is funny,
[50:31.830 --> 50:33.750]  but that gives me an idea. Maybe there's a way for us
[50:33.750 --> 50:35.750]  to play, like, Ghost Recon
[50:35.750 --> 50:37.610]  where we don't fire any guns.
[50:37.770 --> 50:40.150]  Like, see who can live the longest as a pacifist.
[50:40.810 --> 50:41.850]  On our long defense,
[50:41.850 --> 50:42.730]  then we just run and hide.
[50:44.490 --> 50:45.870]  They'll just take the point,
[50:46.050 --> 50:46.510]  unfortunately.
[50:48.230 --> 50:49.770]  Maybe on elimination
[50:49.770 --> 50:50.250]  or something.
[50:52.750 --> 50:53.690]  They're in here.
[50:54.110 --> 50:54.570]  Hit the deck!
[50:55.990 --> 50:57.190]  Shoot the guy!
[50:58.070 --> 50:58.430]  Shoot him!
[51:00.530 --> 51:01.150]  There's two.
[51:02.290 --> 51:02.790]  That's okay.
[51:03.390 --> 51:03.970]  Stay in the dark.
[51:05.170 --> 51:06.110]  There's three.
[51:07.650 --> 51:08.130]  That's okay.
[51:08.130 --> 51:09.790]  I feel like there's another one
[51:09.790 --> 51:11.410]  upstairs also.
[51:11.880 --> 51:13.550]  There's one also in the room.
[51:13.770 --> 51:14.470]  Throw the thing!
[51:17.310 --> 51:17.850]  Wow!
[51:18.210 --> 51:18.650]  Nice!
[51:20.550 --> 51:21.190]  That's okay.
[51:21.630 --> 51:22.810]  Kill this one and then throw the thing.
[51:23.730 --> 51:26.350]  You're gonna have to...
[51:26.350 --> 51:26.570]  Bip!
[51:29.010 --> 51:29.490]  You're right.
[51:30.410 --> 51:31.690]  This is gonna go bad.
[51:33.110 --> 51:33.650]  Almost.
[51:34.010 --> 51:35.630]  It can't possibly...
[51:35.630 --> 51:37.550]  It can't go bad. It already was bad.
[51:37.810 --> 51:39.050]  Albert, what are you doing, buddy?
[51:40.270 --> 51:40.710]  Alright.
[51:41.550 --> 51:41.730]  Alright.
[51:43.250 --> 51:45.590]  So we have a bit of a
[51:45.590 --> 51:47.430]  system down. We just need to figure out the best
[51:47.430 --> 51:49.570]  route to go once we're in the grass. I think it's middle.
[51:51.430 --> 51:53.130]  I've been sticking to the edges
[51:53.130 --> 51:55.510]  and the edges seem to be the walking
[51:55.510 --> 51:58.370]  path of the guards. So...
[52:00.570 --> 52:01.010]  theoretically...
[52:01.010 --> 52:01.790]  Also, I feel
[52:01.790 --> 52:03.810]  like if you would have not attacked that lady,
[52:03.810 --> 52:04.730]  you should have walked by.
[52:04.970 --> 52:07.350]  I don't know for sure.
[52:08.510 --> 52:09.170]  Alright, we'll try this.
[52:09.290 --> 52:10.810]  Well, we know for sure what happened there.
[52:11.950 --> 52:12.390]  Oh.
[52:13.530 --> 52:16.130]  How did that alert him to my location?
[52:16.510 --> 52:17.590]  I just don't...
[52:17.590 --> 52:19.530]  I just don't know why he threw it there.
[52:19.850 --> 52:20.610]  Gavin, do you know?
[52:21.130 --> 52:23.770]  I don't understand. You said throw it
[52:23.770 --> 52:25.870]  away so that it distracts them.
[52:26.190 --> 52:28.110]  So sideways is where you think I mean?
[52:28.490 --> 52:29.230]  Where are you talking?
[52:30.170 --> 52:31.370]  Back into the hallway?
[52:32.230 --> 52:33.410]  Back into the left like
[52:33.410 --> 52:33.750]  Kennedy.
[52:37.250 --> 52:38.910]  Alright, we'll try that. Too soon.
[52:41.450 --> 52:42.590]  Yeah, too soon.
[52:43.170 --> 52:44.910]  Why don't you bring up Princess Diana again?
[52:45.750 --> 52:46.030]  Oh!
[52:47.470 --> 52:49.210]  I was in a theater watching Men in Black
[52:49.210 --> 52:49.750]  when that happened.
[52:52.350 --> 52:53.670]  So you mean back over there?
[52:55.230 --> 52:57.410]  Yeah, I mean just anywhere that's not right next to
[52:57.410 --> 52:59.410]  where you need to go. Well, I was throwing it across the
[52:59.410 --> 52:59.710]  hall.
[52:59.970 --> 53:02.670]  I understand what you're doing.
[53:03.990 --> 53:05.470]  Oh my god.
[53:05.910 --> 53:07.290]  Definitely not the way
[53:08.230 --> 53:09.410]  Nick, you're disintegrating
[53:09.410 --> 53:11.410]  in front of us, man. You were so good in that
[53:11.410 --> 53:13.530]  grass. Just do exactly what you did
[53:13.530 --> 53:15.610]  exactly what you did that time to get in the grass.
[53:15.990 --> 53:17.670]  Nick, don't listen to any of us.
[53:18.670 --> 53:18.950]  Okay.
[53:19.250 --> 53:20.590]  What do you think you should do?
[53:21.310 --> 53:22.910]  I think I should turn it off and go home.
[53:23.810 --> 53:24.950]  You're already home.
[53:25.350 --> 53:26.590]  Oh, good for me.
[53:27.750 --> 53:28.530]  I'm just kidding.
[53:28.630 --> 53:30.550]  I think I'm going to try the
[53:30.550 --> 53:31.990]  grass technique again here.
[53:32.950 --> 53:34.750]  I mean, that's by far the farthest
[53:34.750 --> 53:35.390]  you've made it.
[53:35.910 --> 53:38.350]  Well, yeah, you got your
[53:38.350 --> 53:39.530]  you're blowing up.
[53:47.240 --> 53:48.600]  They're a pretty good shot.
[53:51.880 --> 53:53.500]  Stun bombs don't cause...
[53:54.120 --> 53:55.600]  This is a regulation regression.
[53:57.260 --> 53:58.160]  I just assumed
[53:58.160 --> 54:00.040]  this is what it was when you did this.
[54:01.200 --> 54:01.820]  I mean, we hit some
[54:01.820 --> 54:04.160]  sticky points for sure
[54:04.160 --> 54:05.900]  in the previous videos. Sticky wickets?
[54:06.520 --> 54:06.800]  Yeah.
[54:08.080 --> 54:10.360]  Sometimes you hit sections in games
[54:10.360 --> 54:12.280]  where it's like this and then you come back and you beat it for sure.
[54:12.280 --> 54:13.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:14.240 --> 54:16.200]  Dina, you're the worst cover person
[54:16.200 --> 54:18.300]  in the fucking world. Also, it's going to be so bad in that other room
[54:18.300 --> 54:20.180]  too because there's like four dudes in there already.
[54:20.520 --> 54:21.900]  That's true. Yeah, but if I can get past
[54:21.900 --> 54:24.260]  this bit, I can sneak around in the grass to get the other.
[54:24.260 --> 54:25.360]  Clear the rooms!
[54:25.840 --> 54:28.580]  That last death looked like you had hair growing out of your bullet hole.
[54:29.120 --> 54:31.280]  That was a bad one.
[54:31.880 --> 54:34.360]  That was a bad one. Maybe try mixing it up.
[54:34.400 --> 54:35.180]  Maybe go to the left.
[54:35.540 --> 54:38.720]  The problem is they see you as soon as you do it.
[54:39.260 --> 54:40.420]  Or maybe they don't.
[54:42.280 --> 54:42.640]  RapscallionWannabe
[54:42.640 --> 54:44.320]  asks if the Pico Park
[54:44.320 --> 54:46.420]  coaching will be live streamed. That's a good question.
[54:46.520 --> 54:48.360]  What's the status of the Pico Park
[54:48.360 --> 54:50.380]  live streaming? We have to figure out a lot
[54:50.380 --> 54:52.320]  of that stuff. Yeah, we need to figure out the logistics.
[54:52.320 --> 54:53.880]  To be determined,
[54:54.880 --> 54:56.340]  RapscallionWannabe, to be determined.
[54:57.140 --> 54:57.980]  Speaking of
[54:57.980 --> 55:00.360]  to be determined, if everybody could get their vote in on the
[55:00.360 --> 55:02.280]  puzzle today, we can know which one to buy.
[55:03.360 --> 55:04.400]  Who won the
[55:04.400 --> 55:06.020]  Halloween Candy Draft?
[55:07.480 --> 55:08.480]  I think Eric did.
[55:08.820 --> 55:09.640]  Quite a bit.
[55:10.260 --> 55:10.620]  Oh really?
[55:12.220 --> 55:13.340]  Pretty shocking.
[55:14.960 --> 55:15.520]  YetiMcBums,
[55:15.920 --> 55:17.760]  why not Gavin Andrew playing pinball?
[55:17.920 --> 55:20.440]  Now I think you sneak around here.
[55:20.440 --> 55:22.240]  You can throw that deep down to
[55:22.240 --> 55:23.500]  this back side of the room.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.140]  And then, oh great, insane move.
[55:26.640 --> 55:27.520]  Insane move.
[55:28.780 --> 55:29.260]  Wow.
[55:30.520 --> 55:31.660]  Just fucking kill him.
[55:31.800 --> 55:32.660]  Split him up, split him up.
[55:33.520 --> 55:34.560]  See if he drops anything.
[55:36.920 --> 55:38.180]  Throw his dick to his head.
[55:39.140 --> 55:40.380]  Yeah, throw his dick to his nose.
[55:41.540 --> 55:42.220]  It's your calling card.
[55:44.520 --> 55:46.040]  The cock nose bandit.
[55:46.040 --> 55:49.060]  Butter is high on my trick or treat candy.
[55:49.300 --> 55:50.140]  No it's not!
[55:50.360 --> 55:51.520]  No one has ever
[55:52.580 --> 55:53.360]  gotten that.
[55:58.050 --> 56:00.030]  This is going very well.
[56:00.230 --> 56:00.930]  Almost too well.
[56:02.890 --> 56:04.030]  I'm telling her, and you.
[56:04.330 --> 56:05.150]  Is he dropping his dick?
[56:05.790 --> 56:06.150]  Not yet.
[56:07.730 --> 56:08.450]  Shoot him, Dina!
[56:08.950 --> 56:10.130]  You're so good, Nick.
[56:11.550 --> 56:13.230]  Yeah, there you go. Just move opposite of him.
[56:13.430 --> 56:15.110]  He'll stop, he'll start looking around.
[56:15.110 --> 56:17.430]  He can't see you.
[56:17.430 --> 56:18.750]  He can not see you.
[56:18.770 --> 56:20.230]  You're good.
[56:22.010 --> 56:23.110]  Oh no, more coming.
[56:24.590 --> 56:25.910]  Oh, he's going to go for the head bit.
[56:26.090 --> 56:27.770]  Dina, please get him!
[56:28.610 --> 56:29.810]  It'd be cool if she did, huh?
[56:30.970 --> 56:32.230]  She will zombies.
[56:33.070 --> 56:33.950]  Is there a Dina button?
[56:35.590 --> 56:37.090]  Oh no, now you're in trouble.
[56:37.790 --> 56:39.050]  Well now they're focusing on her at least.
[56:39.370 --> 56:41.050]  Oh my god, right in front of the other guy!
[56:41.190 --> 56:41.490]  Insane!
[56:41.490 --> 56:42.370]  Oh, Nick!
[56:43.650 --> 56:44.850]  Get him, get him, get him!
[56:45.130 --> 56:46.570]  Oh, Dina got him!
[56:46.890 --> 56:47.890]  That's amazing, Nick!
[56:48.650 --> 56:50.850]  Son of a bitch, that was beautiful!
[56:51.310 --> 56:51.790]  Oh, I panicked!
[56:52.850 --> 56:54.430]  You definitely panicked.
[56:54.690 --> 56:56.070]  You suck!
[56:56.910 --> 56:57.430]  You suck!
[56:59.710 --> 57:00.830]  You're awful!
[57:01.790 --> 57:02.630]  Oh my god!
[57:05.250 --> 57:06.570]  Pick up that!
[57:06.750 --> 57:08.350]  You gotta surely pick up that ammo.
[57:09.350 --> 57:10.830]  There's no ammo, there's nothing?
[57:11.110 --> 57:12.090]  No, they didn't drop any.
[57:12.210 --> 57:13.770]  Oh wait, that person's not paying attention.
[57:14.470 --> 57:15.190]  Well, go through the window.
[57:17.570 --> 57:17.970]  No!
[57:19.990 --> 57:21.850]  Oh, Nick!
[57:22.270 --> 57:23.630]  No, I dodged!
[57:23.770 --> 57:24.070]  No!
[57:26.030 --> 57:27.250]  That was so good!
[57:28.510 --> 57:29.330]  Well, I don't know.
[57:29.370 --> 57:34.350]  I think that's the plan.
[57:34.530 --> 57:36.650]  That was amazing, Nick.
[57:36.650 --> 57:37.650]  We got it, this is it.
[57:37.990 --> 57:40.710]  And if that doorframe was a person, it would have been amazing.
[57:41.930 --> 57:42.850]  I do like...
[57:43.570 --> 57:45.250]  I do like the way you shoot
[57:45.250 --> 57:46.550]  and then aim afterward.
[57:46.830 --> 57:48.670]  I think that's pretty cool.
[57:48.890 --> 57:49.870]  I don't know if it's working.
[57:50.210 --> 57:51.450]  Shoot, first, look, second.
[57:51.810 --> 57:54.990]  I think that's a cool, like it's fun to see.
[57:55.210 --> 57:57.050]  I will say, I do think you should try
[57:57.050 --> 57:58.750]  aiming and then firing.
[57:58.970 --> 58:00.970]  Just for like the novelty of it.
[58:01.050 --> 58:02.050]  He's a fan of the quick draw.
[58:02.570 --> 58:03.470]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:03.470 --> 58:05.490]  If you hit that dude in the face
[58:05.490 --> 58:06.750]  with a bottle, does it kill him?
[58:07.670 --> 58:09.370]  No, it just bumps him
[58:09.370 --> 58:10.150]  kind of around.
[58:11.470 --> 58:13.330]  And then you can run over to him.
[58:15.250 --> 58:17.390]  If you hit me, if you threw a bottle across
[58:17.390 --> 58:19.590]  a room and hit me in the head with it, I'm down for the fight.
[58:19.690 --> 58:20.570]  I'm not getting up.
[58:22.130 --> 58:23.450]  Point taken, message
[58:23.450 --> 58:23.890]  received.
[58:26.570 --> 58:27.730]  Like, I surrender, I surrender,
[58:27.870 --> 58:28.510]  I surrender, I surrender.
[58:30.910 --> 58:31.570]  Okay, here we go.
[58:31.570 --> 58:33.590]  This is it, this is the move, this is the run,
[58:33.810 --> 58:34.550]  this is it.
[58:35.610 --> 58:36.270]  Oh my god.
[58:37.530 --> 58:39.410]  I love the confidence in Nick's voice.
[58:39.670 --> 58:40.450]  Feeling it.
[58:41.910 --> 58:43.670]  Oh fuck, I gotta figure that out.
[58:43.770 --> 58:44.330]  Yeah, me too.
[58:45.530 --> 58:46.870]  We're probably gonna have Indian food tonight.
[58:47.810 --> 58:48.290]  Mmm.
[58:48.650 --> 58:50.650]  Yeah, like a little tandoori chicken thing in the fridge.
[58:54.170 --> 58:55.130]  Sounds tasty.
[58:55.490 --> 58:56.370]  Anyone else?
[58:57.090 --> 58:58.050]  I don't know yet.
[58:58.050 --> 58:59.130]  Can I do a steak salad?
[59:00.450 --> 59:01.710]  That also sounds good.
[59:01.790 --> 59:04.190]  I might go for a bit of sush.
[59:04.990 --> 59:05.690]  Oh really?
[59:05.990 --> 59:06.930]  That sounds really good.
[59:07.250 --> 59:10.330]  I was thinking about ordering tonight, but we're gonna go out to dinner for a date tomorrow night.
[59:10.730 --> 59:11.510]  Oh, that's fun.
[59:11.950 --> 59:13.770]  Where are you gonna go so that way I can show up?
[59:15.250 --> 59:16.270]  I'll tell you offline.
[59:16.650 --> 59:17.090]  Oh, okay.
[59:18.290 --> 59:19.730]  We will just go to the date.
[59:21.310 --> 59:22.750]  We're also here.
[59:23.770 --> 59:25.550]  Oh, there are two people here.
[59:25.550 --> 59:25.930]  Holy cow.
[59:26.050 --> 59:27.230]  Yeah, they saw me.
[59:27.910 --> 59:28.370]  Did they?
[59:28.850 --> 59:29.530]  Yeah, they did.
[59:30.570 --> 59:31.110]  Killed him.
[59:32.250 --> 59:33.890]  You just pissed him off with that one.
[59:35.290 --> 59:37.350]  Yeah, there's a gun right there.
[59:37.630 --> 59:38.870]  Yeah, it'd be nice.
[59:39.190 --> 59:41.830]  You know that they had bullets in those guns.
[59:42.590 --> 59:43.390]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[59:43.650 --> 59:44.910]  Unless they were just for show.
[59:45.050 --> 59:47.550]  No, then it can't be for show because they definitely kill you.
[59:48.330 --> 59:50.010]  They're playing on grounded, so they don't know.
[59:50.010 --> 59:51.230]  Not for show.
[59:51.790 --> 59:52.670]  They had ammo right there.
[59:53.830 --> 59:54.910]  It's in your head now.
[59:55.550 --> 59:57.990]  Do Sonic foot-long ponies count as two dogs?
[59:58.150 --> 59:59.630]  No, it's a fucking single dog.
[59:59.750 --> 01:00:03.390]  Why would you even bother reading the chat for something like that, man?
[01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.030]  There's a spirit to what we're doing.
[01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:06.210]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.230]  Like, these people just ask questions.
[01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.530]  They know the answer.
[01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.310]  You know what? I'm tired of this.
[01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:13.870]  Oh my god.
[01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.010]  Oh my god.
[01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.030]  Could you imagine?
[01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.090]  Oh my god.
[01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:21.390]  Oh, now Dina does something.
[01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:22.110]  Great job.
[01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.030]  Oh, missed.
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:25.490]  And died.
[01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:29.790]  You never want to be stood next to Nick when he goes,
[01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:30.190]  501!
[01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.030]  Best time of the day.
[01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:36.710]  Best time of the day.
[01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:40.030]  Nick going, alright, that's it.
[01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:41.190]  It's a scary thing.
[01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:44.150]  It's fucking psycho mode.
[01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.030]  Yeah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do it again
[01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:46.830]  because they spotted me.
[01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.990]  You can surely get two with that.
[01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:53.170]  Definitely got one.
[01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:55.630]  You wanna try me, bro?
[01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:58.150]  Yeah, watch how I don't
[01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.810]  shoot you twice.
[01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:02.030]  You've never seen bullets get closer
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.730]  to you.
[01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:07.030]  He shot me through the bookshelf.
[01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:09.090]  Yeah.
[01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:10.890]  Wood's not bulletproof.
[01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.270]  Neither are you.
[01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:16.130]  Probably not a lot of wood
[01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.030]  armor in 2024.
[01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:19.110]  Dina engaged.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:22.960]  Dammit.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:23.700]  When's the wedding?
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.560]  Is this Silent Hill 2?
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.260]  No, it's not.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:29.820]  No.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.640]  Is Silent Hill the fog
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.860]  game? Yes.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:36.840]  It's a good game.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.760]  Two was, at least.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.920]  Yeah, two is great.
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.140]  Fuck.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.780]  Oh, shut your mouth.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.480]  That's where they always kill you.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.380]  Punch a hole in your head?
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:56.760]  No, you got shot.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.220]  That is the Pyramid Head game.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.880]  Pyramid Game?
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.540]  The Pyramid Head game.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.040]  Silent Hill 2.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.280]  They're changing their
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:11.960]  tactics.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.400]  These guys
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.060]  have new tactics?
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.560]  Get him.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.180]  I'd like to see where the other one is
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.520]  before killing this one.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.820]  There you go.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.680]  I was hoping for a twofer.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.180]  I think you should move around.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.340]  I think.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.060]  Oh my god.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.980]  I love how much
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.120]  you love to do it.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.480]  I don't think that would break on a person.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.140]  No.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.200]  Oh, very excellent.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.320]  Where's the other one?
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.480]  One's left, one's right.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.940]  There's a bottle too.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.480]  Dina, you scared
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.240]  the piss out of me.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.400]  Running through the flames.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.540]  Through the fire and the flames.
[01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.430]  You just have to let him do it.
[01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:29.050]  As long as he's locked in, who cares.
[01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:31.390]  You fool, you turned your back to me!
[01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:31.890]  Ha ha!
[01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.490]  Oh, in the throat hole.
[01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.250]  Alright, you got bullets
[01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.190]  and bottles and one dude left
[01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.990]  to kill, I think.
[01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:42.950]  This is it, Nick.
[01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.430]  I wouldn't go back for him, you gotta push forward, right?
[01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:46.690]  I think he's in that.
[01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.170]  I thought Dina went for him.
[01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:51.310]  Is it a game where if you kill everyone here
[01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:51.930]  you get a checkpoint?
[01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:55.710]  I don't think that's right, is it?
[01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:56.630]  You know what?
[01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:58.270]  Let's make our own fucking checkpoint.
[01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:01.290]  Wait, you can just do that?
[01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:03.170]  You can just do that the whole time?
[01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.330]  Why didn't you do that in the grass?
[01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:05.870]  That's a good question.
[01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.930]  What?
[01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:08.290]  Is this a bit?
[01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.830]  And then he just kills that guy easily.
[01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:14.190]  No, this is just the way Nick is.
[01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:15.810]  What the fuck does that mean?
[01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:17.170]  Anyway.
[01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:20.330]  I'll let everyone else fill in the blanks, dude.
[01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:21.770]  That's just Nick.
[01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:24.750]  I can't believe you can just manually save whenever.
[01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.370]  Yeah.
[01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:26.610]  You know what?
[01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:31.170]  I would have refused that so many thousands of times by now.
[01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:31.830]  Right.
[01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.710]  I got three feet further.
[01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:35.150]  Save.
[01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:41.490]  Okay.
[01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:48.690]  You nameless man.
[01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:51.130]  You nameless soldier.
[01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:52.810]  I like when they have names in the game.
[01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:53.470]  It's very funny.
[01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:55.030]  They're like, oh my god, they killed Ron!
[01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:57.270]  It's like, I don't care who Ron is.
[01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:01.530]  Go here.
[01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:03.950]  Alright, well, didn't let me grab her.
[01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:06.150]  This is where she'll kill you.
[01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:07.290]  Nope.
[01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:09.450]  Are they hearing all this stabbing?
[01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:10.730]  Hit the deck!
[01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:13.030]  He won't.
[01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:15.630]  Nah, he's just gonna get shot in the head.
[01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:16.550]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:19.750]  Hold on, I'm trying to figure out where the others are.
[01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.130]  I know there's one in the grass.
[01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.670]  He can do that while laying in the grass.
[01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:25.370]  Oh, I did get a shot off.
[01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:28.710]  Yeah.
[01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.910]  Craft that.
[01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.690]  No bullets, no health kit.
[01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:33.050]  Oh, you didn't craft?
[01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.250]  No, I'll craft one.
[01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:37.550]  I think he's gotta go potty.
[01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.470]  Poor guy.
[01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.390]  Nick, you need to wrap this up.
[01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.990]  Alright.
[01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.010]  No, no, no, you don't. I'm kidding.
[01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:47.350]  Bottle this shit out of him.
[01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:49.370]  Oh, so more of them came in.
[01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:53.330]  Hold on, I'm just waiting to see if Dina can kill any of them,
[01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:54.530]  and then I'm gonna move back to the grass.
[01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.430]  Or you could go back to the previous rooms
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.490]  and see if there's, like,
[01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:00.610]  anything in the bodies.
[01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.230]  Nah, I looked at the bodies.
[01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:03.870]  No, it would've popped. You would've seen it.
[01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.170]  Uh-oh.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.480]  Clearly you do know where to go.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.100]  Yeah, I have to get to the roof.
[01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:20.250]  I feel like the pole holding the roof up
[01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:22.050]  was a real blessing there.
[01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:26.870]  Oh, there's at least three.
[01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:27.750]  There's probably four.
[01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:33.230]  Visualize the Gatorade on the roof.
[01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.830]  It's blue.
[01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:36.190]  It's blue Gatorade.
[01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:37.830]  Oh, this person died.
[01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:39.670]  Do you have ammo, sir?
[01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:41.410]  Your arm's gone.
[01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:43.170]  You cut his hand off?
[01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:44.370]  That's a signature.
[01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:48.610]  The de-hander, that's what they call you.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:02.280]  Oh, pills.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.140]  Oh, this is bad.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.480]  Yeah, too bad.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.580]  Hopefully you can throw some pills.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.400]  You also have a bottle that you can use.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.620]  Yeah, that's for you.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.600]  And that's for you.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.820]  You fucked up, son.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:21.640]  That was awesome.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.320]  There you go.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.220]  Perfect.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.100]  There's another bottle.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.580]  Just be careful.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:31.880]  I'm in the open.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.120]  You can also save.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:34.600]  Save.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.280]  I just don't like the way...
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.480]  You just like not...
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:39.880]  I don't know.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.940]  I don't know.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.300]  What do you mean?
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.280]  Can you molotov that?
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.580]  No, but I'll just hit him with it.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.880]  I'll just hit him with it when he gets closer.
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.400]  Cracking with the bottle.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:52.760]  Have fun, bud.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.640]  Nick's finally doing it, buddy.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:57.580]  Yeah.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.560]  Maybe one more guy?
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.560]  Or is that it?
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.660]  Maybe not.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.760]  It seems like there might be one.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.260]  Down, down, down, down.
[01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:16.280]  I can see you.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:19.780]  Slit.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.280]  He's done it.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.360]  Hit him through at the end.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.060]  Nice.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.900]  You got a bullet.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.720]  A bullet. A single bullet.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.800]  I think that might be...
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.760]  I think he did it.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.680]  Dang, Nick. You fucking did it.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:36.980]  Food?
[01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:41.330]  Photo mode?
[01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:45.650]  He's gonna take a pic of our success.
[01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.050]  I think you should take a picture of that hand off.
[01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:49.370]  Oh yeah, let's go get it.
[01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:50.670]  Oh yeah, go...
[01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:52.550]  Begin the legacy of the D-hander.
[01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:54.530]  Yeah, let's do it. Let's see.
[01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:57.310]  Alright.
[01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:00.970]  Photo mode, photo mode, photo mode.
[01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:04.970]  How do I...
[01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:05.610]  Get real close.
[01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:07.430]  You're gonna want to zoom in on that.
[01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:10.350]  Take that down.
[01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:12.050]  Oh yeah.
[01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:13.650]  Oh, we're going dick. Sorry.
[01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:17.090]  I like seeing just his mouth.
[01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:19.230]  You get a sense of the pain without being able to
[01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:20.570]  identify who it belongs to.
[01:09:20.610 --> 01:09:22.570]  Where do I actually take a picture?
[01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:23.850]  I believe this is Ron.
[01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:32.130]  Hi, Jimmy.
[01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:37.070]  Take a screenshot.
[01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:40.250]  Exit photo mode.
[01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:41.030]  Okay, let's get to the roof.
[01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:44.190]  And then we can...
[01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:46.570]  I mean, you're saved. You're good, right?
[01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:49.310]  Might as well get to the roof, though. That's been the goal.
[01:09:49.570 --> 01:09:50.510]  Yeah, let's get to the roof.
[01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.390]  It was a long time to get to the roof, but we got to the roof.
[01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:54.930]  Killed by a lightning strike.
[01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.550]  Just random lightning.
[01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:57.390]  It hit me in the back.
[01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.010]  Tripped on a loose shingle.
[01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:03.730]  There's more fighting here, isn't there?
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.950]  We should wrap it up?
[01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.770]  Why don't we kill these two guys, then we'll call it.
[01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:11.890]  If I die, we'll end it. If I live, we end it.
[01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:12.630]  Okay.
[01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:16.490]  We'll kill these two guys.
[01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:20.430]  One pistol on each gun.
[01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.550]  One bullet gun.
[01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:23.770]  Oh, there's three of them.
[01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:27.510]  We only got two bullets.
[01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.090]  Where we're going, we don't need bullets.
[01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.390]  Cut his Achilles tendon.
[01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:33.250]  I hate that.
[01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.990]  Hobble him. Like misery.
[01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.930]  You wrote my favorite book.
[01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:43.490]  I wrote a kid's novel!
[01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:45.950]  It's like a pop-up book.
[01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:48.430]  What is Fortin hearing now?
[01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:50.170]  Kick him in the butt! Kick his butt!
[01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:54.550]  I'm amazed you can just...
[01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:56.510]  You can't just give him a boot off the fucking roof.
[01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.950]  He was leaning over.
[01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:00.730]  Did you fall off the roof doing your little back step?
[01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:03.950]  You better pick a way to go here, bud.
[01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:05.330]  Yeah, kick him off.
[01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:08.650]  Well, it doesn't let you take the body.
[01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.010]  Yeah, but you can crawl into it and push off.
[01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:12.470]  I can crawl into the body?
[01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:14.210]  It's okay, it's okay. We'll listen to them.
[01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.230]  Your new signature is to take over their corpses.
[01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:20.750]  I don't mean get inside the body.
[01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:22.850]  I mean crawl against it and push it.
[01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:25.390]  Like a weekend at Bernie's situation
[01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:27.070]  where you're holding them up from the back?
[01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:29.710]  I'm Ron!
[01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:32.690]  All clear over here!
[01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:37.090]  Your decision-making is so piss-poor, it's crazy.
[01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:39.390]  I like your decision.
[01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.910]  It's like he goes on these runs
[01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:45.130]  where it's like, wow, dude, you're stellar at this.
[01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:47.530]  And then all of a sudden, it's just like,
[01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:48.970]  I'm gonna stand up.
[01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:51.250]  I'm gonna stand up.
[01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:51.730]  I'm gonna play a game.
[01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:54.650]  Eric said that I've got two companies with this guy level.
[01:11:57.190 --> 01:11:58.330]  He flew through that.
[01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:00.370]  The way he killed the one person, he's sneaking around,
[01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:02.910]  he's moving so well, and then all of a sudden...
[01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:04.870]  I think I'm gonna give my position away.
[01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:09.970]  Alright, well...
[01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:13.770]  You don't have anything in that gun.
[01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:17.690]  Alright, well that ends it.
[01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:20.890]  You got through the grass!
[01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.310]  Got through the grass.
[01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.210]  Gotta go through the wind turbines this time.
[01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.050]  Alright, uh...
[01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:28.670]  You wanna end it here, or should we try one last time?
[01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.510]  Oh, one more.
[01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:31.190]  One last time.
[01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:34.930]  Let me just make sure that both guns are reloaded here.
[01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.690]  Sorry, Albert.
[01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:37.970]  We're doing one last time.
[01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:42.070]  Cool, then we'll tailsync, and I have something...
[01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:43.910]  I have like two things that I gotta go over.
[01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:45.770]  Oh, what?
[01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:45.890]  What?
[01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:48.850]  I really do have to take my dog to the bathroom.
[01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:51.990]  I understand, I just have a couple quick things.
[01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:55.230]  I gotta take myself to the bathroom.
[01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:56.830]  Piss in a bottle.
[01:12:58.530 --> 01:12:59.290]  Drink a beer?
[01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:02.030]  A Clamato.
[01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:04.230]  Okay, this guy's
[01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:05.150]  fucking nuts.
[01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.210]  So crazy.
[01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:09.170]  I remember that conversation.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.620]  It was just so funny with three people being on the same page
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.460]  and someone else being like...
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.740]  It's great, you got the upper hand.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.440]  What a shot, Nick!
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:24.960]  Yeah, it was really good.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.800]  Is that cover?
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:29.460]  Yeah.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.540]  Alright, here we go.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:33.400]  Dina?
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.640]  It'd be nice if you provided some cover.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.980]  You better start running.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.540]  We go for the instant bit.
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:50.780]  Okay.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.100]  How does Nick
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:53.940]  blow this?
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:54.760]  Shh, quiet.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.060]  Oh, he does it.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.060]  He pulls it out in the end.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:00.720]  Game over.
