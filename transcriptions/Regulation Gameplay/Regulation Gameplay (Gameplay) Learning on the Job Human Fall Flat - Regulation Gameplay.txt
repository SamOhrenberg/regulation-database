[00:01.210 --> 00:06.550]  Oh, okay, what what is this game? It's human fall flat. It's cut
[00:06.550 --> 00:12.590]  It's it's like gang beasts, but we're not fighting each other. We're just doing good work together. Oh
[00:12.590 --> 00:17.170]  We're doing good work together. I don't want an instructional video
[00:19.450 --> 00:20.770]  Hey, I feel
[00:23.810 --> 00:27.550]  Gotta be honest Gav. I feel like I might have an unfair advantage
[00:27.550 --> 00:31.190]  I played about seven minutes of this before we started recording. So I feel like a pro
[00:32.090 --> 00:33.690]  Okay, were you never in any of the
[00:34.670 --> 00:41.770]  Series we did with Achievement Hunter. I think it came after me if I was I was in like one maybe you know
[00:42.970 --> 00:45.370]  One or two maybe I have no memory of it
[00:49.310 --> 00:54.790]  Yeah, that's true. The trick is to grab it's very important you can climb you can pull
[00:55.470 --> 00:56.290]  uh-huh
[00:56.810 --> 00:58.470]  You need control of different arms.
[00:59.550 --> 01:04.590]  I just found out if you press the X button, it says play dead and then it takes a long time to stop playing dead
[01:04.590 --> 01:05.990]  Oh my god. Oh shit
[01:11.310 --> 01:12.110]  My god
[01:28.470 --> 01:31.730]  Me and Geoff went to rescue but we just started holding hands
[01:35.130 --> 01:43.630]  This is like an Andrew Pantin magic trick watch this I can make a yellow man appear. Oh shit. Yeah
[01:45.130 --> 01:54.050]  I'm the yellow man. Hey, so Geoff's the the karate guy. Yeah. Yeah. So why don't we pull his arms apart and stretch him?
[01:54.050 --> 01:54.550]  Okay
[01:56.510 --> 02:00.330]  He's grabbing himself a little bit, I don't know how to unwrap like let go yourself
[02:02.110 --> 02:07.930]  All right, I'm gonna oops, okay, I'm gonna try and hold his hand is that you Nick with a shot of this
[02:07.930 --> 02:13.290]  I'm being the camera. This is good. I am the mustachioed shape. I'm the hazmat top hat. All right
[02:13.770 --> 02:15.850]  I'm the I'm the professional wrestler
[02:31.270 --> 02:31.750]  I
[02:46.410 --> 02:50.910]  Want to play dead so I lean over the edge, okay, and then hold me
[02:54.810 --> 02:55.330]  I
[02:56.470 --> 02:58.530]  Got you. Wait, grab a hold
[02:59.050 --> 03:03.250]  Gavin grab hold of my leg. Let me grab the other arm. I'm gonna grab your legs
[03:03.970 --> 03:04.490]  No
[03:09.170 --> 03:11.210]  I'm on Nick's legs
[03:13.730 --> 03:17.550]  Guys oh no. Oh, oh no, I'm in cutter
[03:30.710 --> 03:31.050]  Oh
[03:31.050 --> 03:36.910]  Geoff what's the plan? All right. I think we gotta go. We gotta go through this door
[03:37.890 --> 03:39.650]  Okay, we're gonna grab one side. I'll grab the other
[03:41.110 --> 03:45.430]  Achilles man, didn't you need help? Oh, that was easier than expected simple
[03:47.770 --> 03:52.730]  Okay, here we go, hang on pull this back Nick you want to grab the other one to move it, yeah
[03:54.230 --> 04:00.110]  Killing it right now this baby mode stuff. Yeah, it's like gang beasts if the goal is not to kill everybody else
[04:00.110 --> 04:02.910]  Yeah, yeah, if there was a goal, I guess
[04:03.510 --> 04:04.570]  Let go of me
[04:11.450 --> 04:15.590]  So, what are we supposed to oh, okay, okay
[04:17.630 --> 04:18.430]  What I
[04:18.910 --> 04:22.850]  Think how do you climb? I think you guys got to grab that top one and keep moving it
[04:24.190 --> 04:26.630]  Wait, hold on I got it
[04:28.270 --> 04:32.350]  Wait, how do you how do you get up? I made it in the next room look up
[04:33.550 --> 04:35.970]  Now hold both triggers. Oh
[04:35.970 --> 04:40.630]  And then you could reach with your arms then you grab. Yeah. Oh, yeah, this isn't haven't teaching me trick
[04:40.630 --> 04:41.970]  This isn't a race is it?
[04:42.450 --> 04:42.850]  No
[04:46.120 --> 04:46.410]  Oh
[04:48.590 --> 04:51.010]  You're holding me for England James
[04:52.550 --> 04:55.690]  No, baby. I
[04:55.690 --> 04:56.190]  Let go
[04:56.190 --> 05:04.610]  How do you okay Gavin Gavin, I think you got to get on the upper floor part and then we'll pull it back
[05:04.610 --> 05:06.710]  Oh, okay. Yeah big time
[05:07.330 --> 05:12.690]  But then how do I get well, I guess I will ragdoll and pick you up. Is there a sprint?
[05:13.770 --> 05:17.970]  No, I tried pressing a bunch of buttons I can figure it out. All right, ready? Yeah comes
[05:20.250 --> 05:25.150]  Geoff go. I'm just a little bit. There we go. Wait and see how we catch up. Why just checking stuff out
[05:25.150 --> 05:28.190]  Ah, I was recon out making sure everything was safe for everybody
[05:32.030 --> 05:36.750]  Who's rolling down the stairs me how'd you get up there so fast that was awesome I fell
[05:36.750 --> 05:39.310]  We just gotta navigate these
[05:40.010 --> 05:40.730]  train cars
[05:41.510 --> 05:41.910]  Yeah
[05:43.170 --> 05:47.610]  Shit, what's that someone throw a yellow thing off? What is that? No
[05:48.550 --> 05:52.490]  Hold the column while walking on the platform. Oh those that's the instructional video tells you what to do
[05:53.130 --> 05:56.510]  So I think we need to get people here. Like you guys jump up on top of that
[05:57.210 --> 05:58.790]  Yeah, and then I'll pull it
[06:00.730 --> 06:03.590]  Okay, and then you can cross over to that side
[06:11.810 --> 06:15.130]  Oh, that was pretty cool. All right, Nick climb. Yeah
[06:16.550 --> 06:18.270]  All right, Nick climb. Oh Nick
[06:18.270 --> 06:26.490]  Yeah, Nick climb. We're climbing. Yeah, we did that actually work. That was sick, dude. We're so good at this. Oh, how did you climb?
[06:27.790 --> 06:35.830]  So if you look up and then hold your triggers you reach up and then you hold a to like climb up
[06:37.430 --> 06:37.910]  I
[06:38.530 --> 06:40.610]  You hold a is jump
[06:46.030 --> 06:48.350]  You if you so if you grab something
[06:48.970 --> 06:55.690]  Right, if you're if you're looking at you grab yeah, you can look down and it'll it'll pull you up above your arms
[06:57.850 --> 07:03.950]  So like look up grab and then look down and you'll you like and then if you alternate arms you can just climb kind of
[07:11.690 --> 07:12.050]  I
[07:12.050 --> 07:13.810]  Just check in the side of a train, but no
[07:16.150 --> 07:17.630]  Trying to learn Gav
[07:19.430 --> 07:24.990]  No, I don't think I'm ever gonna climb I don't think your knees I don't think climbing's in the cards
[07:35.130 --> 07:35.850]  I'm bashful
[07:39.050 --> 07:43.150]  I'm getting so many achievements my face. Let go my face

[10:06.040 --> 10:09.640]  It is we're so good at this. Well, you're like riding it. That's pretty cool
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.520]  You know, the only the Saturday about the moving out games is that nobody has been watching the videos
[10:21.240 --> 10:28.400]  I guess we shouldn't have made eight parts. You made eight. No, we made six. I mean we made six. Yeah, we got yeah
[10:28.400 --> 10:29.020]  We're up there
[10:45.810 --> 10:46.210]  I
[10:46.610 --> 10:51.010]  Wish people were watching moving out because it was really good. It was a lot of fun. I loved playing moving out
[10:51.950 --> 10:53.670]  Oh, no, is it for player?
[10:54.690 --> 10:55.090]  Yes
[10:57.190 --> 10:57.590]  Oh
[10:58.970 --> 11:02.990]  No, dude, look at us platforming our assholes out is the floor lava
[11:04.370 --> 11:05.510]  No, it's just suck
[11:07.870 --> 11:08.270]  Oh
[11:09.270 --> 11:14.990]  He's right. God bless it. You never played the floor is the floor sucks as a kid
[11:16.290 --> 11:19.610]  The floor sucks. Yeah, you just turn the vacuum upside down and let it go
[11:21.030 --> 11:21.830]  floor sucks
[11:23.630 --> 11:25.690]  You go on the floor and then you suck
[11:33.990 --> 11:36.230]  Now what do I do how'd you do that
[11:37.530 --> 11:39.290]  Do up you just jumped right up there

[12:08.890 --> 12:13.350]  Think you think you probably could have just wait. I mean that it's like a cool way to do it. I guess I
[12:14.650 --> 12:16.050]  Think you just climb straight over
[12:17.150 --> 12:17.550]  trying
[12:19.930 --> 12:21.010]  You have to jump
[12:23.390 --> 12:29.030]  Okay, jump again Geoff I wonder if it's the most delayed jump in all of gaming grab me
[12:29.630 --> 12:30.310]  grab me
[12:30.990 --> 12:32.070]  grab my legs
[12:33.990 --> 12:35.110]  Shit Geoff I fucked

[13:02.120 --> 13:05.560]  Now hang on I move the train now. I can just walk through why didn't you do that before?
[13:06.200 --> 13:07.560]  I didn't know I could walk through
[13:09.360 --> 13:14.700]  Wait, but then even still what am I supposed to do come over it? Oh?
[13:14.820 --> 13:20.140]  My god, there's nowhere to go I have yeah, no I get it. I'm I don't know how to get over there though
[13:21.260 --> 13:23.360]  Hmm like walking through doesn't help me
[13:26.120 --> 13:29.920]  And I'm I'm almost smart enough to figure out the climbing, but I'm not quite there
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.520]  Like I can feel it like I can feel like my brain starting to wrinkle like I'm like real like I'm starting to get it
[13:37.520 --> 13:39.640]  But you've got one foot in yeah, yeah
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.980]  I'm like it's got like one button away from it really making sense, so I don't quite have it
[13:50.660 --> 13:56.280]  Like up is down and that like really throws me yeah, I gotta like do two different ways you gotta invert dog
[13:57.260 --> 14:00.620]  Nah, I know what I said, but I'm inverted you're a little tick
[14:01.400 --> 14:02.900]  Yeah, you're not flying a plane son

[15:06.940 --> 15:11.380]  I think I didn't push it hard enough and now it's now it's stuck. What what does that mean?
[15:11.760 --> 15:13.600]  I want but I'm trying to catch the train
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.780]  Is it working I need more people to help me pull the train I'm coming here
[15:22.760 --> 15:27.140]  I'm coming to I'll help you. I hope you push it so I can catch it. I think I derailed it by accident
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.380]  Ha Oh nice jump Nick. Thank you. So that in the corner of my eyeball. Oh, hell. Yeah
[15:41.440 --> 15:42.460]  If I can just
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.640]  Push it. Oh, I push it. Are we pulling it or pushing it? We need to do the same either way
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.940]  Okay, you tell me the pole
[15:50.940 --> 15:51.820]  Okay
[15:53.500 --> 15:56.840]  Nick Nick Paul, it's not it's not go back Nick Paul
[15:58.140 --> 16:02.300]  Gavin I had to restart that I had to restart that section. Oh, no, I'm hanging
[16:06.560 --> 16:14.100]  Geoff you all right. Okay. All right now I got it. Huh? Well, I guess I've read this bit. Yeah, what the fuck happened?
[16:14.140 --> 16:14.780]  What'd you do?
[16:17.940 --> 16:20.780]  And then how do you climb now I'm here now
[16:20.780 --> 16:23.980]  So you can try and wangle one of your arms up more
[16:24.580 --> 16:25.500]  So you could be like
[16:26.640 --> 16:31.520]  Like I fall too fast for it to do that. Yeah, it's a bit of a jangle fest
[16:40.640 --> 16:45.560]  What are we trying to do move this train, okay. Yeah, but there's nowhere to go
[16:47.060 --> 16:50.380]  I'm pulling it. It's off the fucking track. Yeah, I wrecked it
[16:50.380 --> 16:54.520]  Are we pulling it? Yes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, let's pull
[17:01.220 --> 17:05.680]  Come on Nick pull the train. Okay, let me grab and pull
[17:06.320 --> 17:11.900]  Wiggle the train. There's nothing it ain't going. It's a heavy old train, you know, I think you blew it. Yeah
[17:11.900 --> 17:15.980]  Can we push it? Yeah. Yeah, let's try pushing. I'm pushing
[17:21.940 --> 17:22.860]  I got nothing here
[17:26.140 --> 17:29.120]  Well, I can't get up past where I am I
[17:30.520 --> 17:32.820]  Haven't restart though. I haven't moved in 10 minutes. I guess so
[17:32.820 --> 17:36.240]  I don't know how I don't know how we're supposed to beat it. Like it's stuck everything's stuck. All right
[17:36.240 --> 17:37.040]  Is that put it back?
[17:37.900 --> 17:38.520]  It's back
[17:39.160 --> 17:45.460]  What do you mean? What happened? What's wrong? Oh, it's not back. It's not back at all. I just started somewhere else
[17:45.920 --> 17:51.660]  Yeah, you're over there. Oh, yeah, that didn't help us. No, hold on if I was there would it help it?
[17:53.320 --> 18:00.240]  Don't know. I mean, I don't know how these skills could assist. How did you get up there, dude? I jumped
[18:01.900 --> 18:04.620]  Can you stand under me? Yeah, I am
[18:05.700 --> 18:11.420]  Here there. Let me see if I can land on you. Oh, there you go. Hang on. Okay, I'm gonna go up
[18:11.420 --> 18:14.080]  Yeah, there you go. Pull

[18:32.260 --> 18:34.100]  Same place. I've been trying to climb for an hour
[18:36.820 --> 18:42.840]  I'm actually not playing anymore. I'm just kind of hanging out. Oh, I gave up trying to get up this thing. I can't do it

[18:58.160 --> 19:05.020]  Hey, hey Gavin missed it Gavin. I think he's being sarcastic. Yeah. Well, I don't think it's a failure of understanding the instructions
[19:05.020 --> 19:06.960]  I think it's a failure of talent and ability
[19:07.880 --> 19:08.320]  Okay
[19:10.400 --> 19:11.680]  Gavin seemed okay with that
[19:12.960 --> 19:18.640]  I mean, I've been there. I understand. I can't climb up this thing. I think we have to research. I don't know what we're supposed to do
[19:19.500 --> 19:24.740]  Oh, I'll help you climb this time Geoff. Oh, wait a second. What what is it? How'd you do that? What happened?
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.880]  What happened? Are we just supposed to do that? Maybe you're supposed to go there
[19:30.760 --> 19:34.960]  Jump down here where I am. No, no, let Gavin get to the top because we will launch him on top of this
[19:34.960 --> 19:37.920]  I mean, that's how I started. I'm the one who put it the other
[19:39.420 --> 19:41.820]  There you go now you want to cross it yeah
[19:43.380 --> 19:46.980]  I feel like this should be a little bit more tipped, but maybe not

[19:54.320 --> 19:54.720]  Yeah

[48:38.310 --> 48:43.430]  Here comes Geoff not even close it Gavin, hey Gavin, yeah
[48:43.430 --> 48:49.350]  Gavin you gotta move it closer. Okay, so you set the rock and then you move it back
[48:50.810 --> 48:56.930]  That almost made it to the edge of where you're firing it from. So that was so I'll do it from as close as possible
[48:56.930 --> 49:02.090]  Yeah, I think that might be what you need to do. Oh, I'm it if I'm the worst idiot
[49:04.990 --> 49:09.590]  Lower the frickin bucket more Gavin kind of finally catching up to what we've been saying

[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.500]  Oh, it spit all over my monitor.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.600]  How did you go up backwards, Geoff?
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.620]  I just do what I can.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.520]  Come on.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.360]  Geoff.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.540]  Come on.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.540]  Pull me through life like you've been doing all this time.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:26.960]  I'm trying so hard.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.740]  Drag me through my experience.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.180]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:29.760]  Yeah, that's it, Nick.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.840]  Wow, that's, I think, a metaphor for quite a lot there.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.800]  Alright, Nick, keep going.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:37.440]  Keep going.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.240]  Signs of things to come, I guess.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:40.400]  Keep going.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.300]  I can't just...
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:41.920]  A little more.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:42.620]  Nope.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.860]  A little more.
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:44.520]  A little more.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.160]  A little more.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:46.900]  There we go.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.040]  I'm through.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:48.700]  Oh, shit!
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.260]  I'm through.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:50.860]  Hey!
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.000]  You can all die and just get over here.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.100]  What are you talking about?
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:54.560]  Die of what?
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:55.920]  Jump.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.400]  Let me up, damn it!
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.180]  Why would I die?
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.560]  I'm in front of you.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:00.400]  Yeah, no.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.360]  We made it.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.420]  I'm here!
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.020]  Oh, let's hook this frickin' light, shall we?
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.040]  Finally, my skill.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.160]  There you go, Gavin.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.460]  I've got both.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:14.380]  There you go.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.420]  That's all, folks.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.000]  That's awesome.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.040]  Yeah!
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.840]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:26.690]  The rope's freaking out!
[01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:27.170]  Whoa!
[01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:28.850]  Oh, shit!
[01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:29.590]  I can't...
[01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:30.230]  Someone grab it.
[01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:31.890]  Make it better.
[01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:33.390]  Eric, don't let go.
[01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:34.810]  No, no, no, no.
[01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:37.090]  Let me see if I can apply you to one of these walls.
[01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.350]  No!
[01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:38.470]  Why'd you do that?
[01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:40.690]  Yeah, Gavin!
[01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.570]  You missed big time there.
[01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:44.210]  I sure did.
[01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:45.350]  Alright, I've delivered the light.
[01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:47.830]  And I've got the pole for some reason.
[01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:48.330]  Nice.
[01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:49.290]  I don't think you need the pole.
[01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:51.390]  I don't think you need the pole.
[01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:55.770]  No, what the fuck?!
[01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:58.550]  Oh, wow.
[01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:00.250]  Right on to Gav.
[01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:01.790]  Alright.
[01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:05.110]  Swing for freedom, gents!
[01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.150]  And swing!
[01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:05.890]  Yeah!
[01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:09.990]  Have you got the pole?
[01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:10.910]  No, no, no, no, no!
[01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:11.430]  The pole's gone.
[01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:12.910]  If so, am I!
[01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:20.670]  Geoff, you might have to let go.
[01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:21.570]  You might be a little too high.
[01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:25.950]  Come on!
[01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:26.530]  I missed.
[01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.950]  I died the way I lived.
[01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:30.510]  Dying.
[01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:33.950]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:35.010]  Is this really what we're doing?
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.020]  I got you, Gavin.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.380]  Gavin, I got you.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.640]  Gavin, don't let go.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.040]  Gavin, don't let go.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.140]  To the roof!
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.400]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:49.600]  No!
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:50.300]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:55.300]  Oh, fuck.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.180]  Where are we supposed to go from there?
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:57.480]  The roof.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.350]  I think you can...
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.040]  When I played this last time, we managed to turn the entire windmill by accident.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:05.860]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.820]  Should we see if we can get one of us on each thing?
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.140]  Yeah.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.320]  Oh, shit.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.400]  Oh, wait. Gavin's on this one.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.400]  Alright, I'll go to the next one.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.420]  I got the next one. Here we go!
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.500]  I'm up!
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:26.820]  I'm on!
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.020]  Alright, Eric's on opposite me.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:30.120]  It's my one.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.100]  Nick, grab the next one.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:31.520]  Got it.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:32.900]  I'm on, baby!
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.500]  I'm right here. What do I gotta get on?
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.040]  Grab the next one.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.660]  Alright, this one right here. This one's yours, Geoff. Grab it!
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.320]  Yeah!
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:39.680]  Yeah!
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.160]  Windmill boys!
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:43.700]  Freedom!
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.000]  Where are we supposed to go?
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.600]  I think this was it.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.260]  I think we were just trying to get to here.
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.480]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:56.840]  Oh, no!
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:14:59.760]  Oh, to the top.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:03.200]  I don't think you're meant to get up here, but it's nice.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.200]  I don't think so. I'm pretty sure you're not.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.660]  Alright, well, let's...
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:07.340]  Let's go!
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.600]  You're just holding me like a doll.
[01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:26.650]  Did you make it?
[01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.130]  Hey, it worked! I got Gavin to the next spot.
[01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:31.650]  Gavin made it to the next part.
[01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:35.090]  That's what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to take the windmill over.
[01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:37.230]  You grab it, and then it shoots you over.
[01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:38.610]  I guess I better do that.
[01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:42.770]  I think I'm at the part after you. I'm, like, way up here.
[01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.310]  Oh.
[01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:46.250]  What the fuck? What the fuck?
[01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:47.030]  Oh, no!
[01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:48.670]  Oh! Oh, no!
[01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:49.430]  Where are you?
[01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:51.930]  I went down below. I'm, like, in a dungeon?
[01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:54.470]  What is this?
[01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:57.290]  Yeah, what...
[01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:58.830]  Where am I?
[01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:05.790]  Yes, I got it.
[01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:06.030]  Okay.
[01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:09.570]  So, check this out. Come down to the bottom.
[01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:10.610]  You found the way?
[01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:12.330]  Yeah, I think so. Come down to the bottom.
[01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:12.790]  Oh.
[01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:15.350]  I started fucking around.
[01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:17.350]  And knocking stuff over.
[01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:19.490]  Yeah, I started fucking around and I found out.
[01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:21.450]  Uh, I just walked off the edge and almost made it.
[01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:22.070]  What the fuck?
[01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:23.650]  So, check this out.
[01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:25.450]  Watch.
[01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:28.930]  I started knocking over, uh...
[01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:33.590]  I started climbing stuff, found a boulder, knocked over some pieces that made bridges, and then it made this.
[01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:35.450]  Very nice.
[01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.030]  Yeah, thank you. And I think that's the way to go.
[01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:39.010]  Why didn't you climb it?
[01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:40.510]  I tried to, I missed.
[01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.950]  Here, Geoff, check this out.
[01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.490]  Alright, coming.
[01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:48.550]  You could just jump off the... You don't need to go down there. Just jump onto Eric's bridge from up there.
[01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:52.150]  Ah, see, I gotta show him where the bridge is. See, and then Gavin already... Gavin just made it.
[01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:57.330]  So, I knocked over, I found a boulder, started knocking stuff over, it started making bridges down into these caverns.
[01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:57.870]  Nick, you see this bridge?
[01:16:58.650 --> 01:16:59.010]  Uh...
[01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:01.190]  And then there's a... And then there's a bridge that it made.
[01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:01.550]  There it is.
[01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:02.410]  Right here.
[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.410]  Yeah.
[01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:05.490]  Oh, I'm... I made it.
[01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:07.270]  You made it, Nick?
[01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:09.910]  Yeah, only because I fell to my death.
[01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:16.030]  Gavin, send me.
[01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:17.550]  Yeah, send him.
[01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:19.310]  Hold on, I'm charging it.
[01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:20.370]  Cool.
[01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.090]  Geoff, send him.
[01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:23.210]  I do this for all of us.
[01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:25.730]  I'm gonna put my hands up.
[01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:28.130]  I'm gonna take up the back. Someone release.
[01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.810]  Ow.
[01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:30.790]  Pull it up.
[01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:34.490]  Oh my God.
[01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:35.850]  Oh my God.
[01:17:35.970 --> 01:17:37.430]  Grab it. Pull it down.
[01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.930]  We're trying.
[01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.550]  Pull it down.
[01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.090]  We did it.
[01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:39.630]  Doing it.
[01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.410]  Wow.
[01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:41.810]  Boom.
[01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.890]  Awesome.
[01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:44.070]  Sucks to be Nick.
[01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.930]  That was so cool.
[01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:47.490]  That was so cool.
[01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.930]  I made it.
[01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.190]  I'm alive.
[01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:50.670]  Wait, but how do we get through this?
[01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:52.730]  Oh, we have to bring this piece of wood.
[01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:54.030]  Or...
[01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.330]  There's a...
[01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:55.510]  We just catapult again.
[01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:56.010]  Yeah.
[01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:56.890]  There you go.
[01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:58.030]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:59.950]  See, that's why you're the big brains of the operation.
[01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:01.590]  Okay, there you go.
[01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:02.610]  Alright, everyone jump in.
[01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:04.010]  Nick, go ahead and jump in.
[01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.850]  I'll release it.
[01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:05.490]  Okay.
[01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:07.670]  We will have to play dead at the same time, I think.
[01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:08.170]  Alright, ready?
[01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:09.010]  How do we play dead again?
[01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:10.130]  Okay, everyone play dead.
[01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:10.670]  You hit X.
[01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:11.350]  One, two, three, X.
[01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:11.970]  Go.
[01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.670]  Send us through.
[01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:15.270]  I'm trying.
[01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:16.150]  You guys all played dead.
[01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:17.310]  Okay, bye.
[01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:19.230]  Go.
[01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.630]  Oh, close.
[01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:24.170]  Oh, we're close.
[01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:24.590]  So close.
[01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:26.030]  Did anyone make it?
[01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.630]  We're really close.
[01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:27.890]  Alright, Geoff.
[01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.570]  Nice and easy.
[01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:30.190]  Alright, nice and easy, Nick.
[01:18:30.690 --> 01:18:31.270]  Oh, God.
[01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:32.330]  Alright, swing in.
[01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.890]  Swing in.
[01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:33.990]  Swing in.
[01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.830]  You got it.
[01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:35.330]  I did it.
[01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:37.090]  Are you through?
[01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:37.630]  I'm in.
[01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:38.310]  Did you make it through?
[01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.910]  I made it in.
[01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:39.190]  Really?
[01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:40.090]  The exit's this way.
[01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:41.990]  Keep going until it hits the same point or whatever.
[01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:43.310]  The exit.
[01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:44.490]  Yeah.
[01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:45.130]  Yeah, do it.
[01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:45.510]  Do it.
[01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:46.190]  Make it to the exit.
[01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.650]  Yeah.
[01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:48.370]  That's a level.
[01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.750]  Alright.
[01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:50.410]  We did it.
[01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:53.670]  Guys, thanks so much for watching Human Fall Flat.
[01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:55.010]  This is a regulation gameplay.
[01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:59.030]  If you like that, there's more on this channel probably.
[01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:00.750]  So, go check it out.
[01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:02.390]  Geoff, what did you think of this game?
[01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:03.470]  I like it a lot.
[01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:04.470]  I didn't like it at first.
[01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:05.950]  I liked it at last.
[01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:08.910]  Took me a while.
[01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.770]  That's awesome.
[01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:14.790]  If you're wondering why this video is an hour long instead of an hour and a half, it's because Geoff didn't like it at first.
[01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:15.730]  That's not true.
[01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:17.530]  I just couldn't get fucking past a point.
[01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:19.910]  Wait, not me.
[01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:26.390]  Well, guys, check us out at the regulation pod on everything probably.
[01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:27.030]  I don't know.
[01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.750]  Patreon.com slash the regulation pod is the important thing.
[01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:33.470]  Thank you so much for watching and go listen to the podcast.
[01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:34.190]  We'll see you next time.
[01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:34.570]  Bye.
[01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:35.310]  Not like this.
[01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.830]  Bye.
[01:19:36.670 --> 01:19:37.190]  Not like this.
[01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.870]  Don't do it.
