[00:00.000 --> 00:01.140]  Let's set sail.
[00:02.260 --> 00:05.220]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:05.300 --> 00:07.140]  We're setting sails. We're hitting the seas.
[00:07.740 --> 00:09.740]  Wow. We're going to go fight some people.
[00:10.480 --> 00:11.800]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're fighting.
[00:12.780 --> 00:13.760]  We'll get there.
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.040]  We'll see what's on the map.
[00:15.400 --> 00:16.040]  Where's Ballerina?
[00:16.540 --> 00:19.260]  Oh, that's uh, that hasn't started yet.
[00:19.500 --> 00:20.920]  We're collecting different gold coins.
[00:21.300 --> 00:23.380]  We got to dig for the coins.
[00:23.840 --> 00:25.140]  I am so excited.
[00:25.220 --> 00:26.080]  I wish you would set sail.
[00:26.200 --> 00:27.260]  I am so excited.
[00:27.720 --> 00:29.340]  I mean, I just, it was just kind of sitting here.
[00:29.340 --> 00:31.240]  I don't know. I was waiting.
[00:31.580 --> 00:33.000]  Honestly, I'm just waiting for the video to start.
[00:33.600 --> 00:34.360]  I'm just waiting.
[00:34.560 --> 00:36.100]  I'm waiting for like the video to start.
[00:36.240 --> 00:38.220]  But yeah, I mean, yeah, the video started.
[00:38.700 --> 00:40.100]  I just thought, I don't know.
[00:40.220 --> 00:41.340]  I think the video could start right here.
[00:41.400 --> 00:45.480]  Guys, welcome to the high seas, high jinks of Sea of Thieves.
[00:45.580 --> 00:48.200]  It's season 16 and Reapers rule this season, guys.
[00:48.600 --> 00:49.800]  See, that's the beginning of the video.
[00:49.900 --> 00:50.580]  All this other stuff.
[00:50.860 --> 00:52.180]  We're just sitting around. That's not in this.
[00:52.500 --> 00:55.160]  I don't think that's even the intro to the video because we're still sitting around.
[00:55.720 --> 00:57.320]  I think the video probably starts right here.
[00:57.320 --> 01:00.680]  Guys, welcome to Sea of Thieves regulation gameplay.
[01:01.100 --> 01:04.720]  I hope you're ready for some open ocean high jinks
[01:04.720 --> 01:07.780]  because we are going to be serving up the last...
[01:07.780 --> 01:10.780]  The point of high jinks is that it was high, like high seas high jinks.
[01:10.840 --> 01:11.380]  It was like...
[01:11.380 --> 01:11.680]  Hide.
[01:11.980 --> 01:13.260]  Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
[01:14.280 --> 01:16.440]  Then nobody knows what you're talking about because the video started right there.
[01:17.620 --> 01:18.600]  This is Sea of Thieves.
[01:19.280 --> 01:19.760]  Sneak.
[01:20.720 --> 01:21.520]  I'm a barrel.
[01:21.900 --> 01:22.600]  Andrew, what are we doing?
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.060]  Uh, let's go to the boat.
[01:25.720 --> 01:27.680]  Let's all go to the boat now.
[01:27.820 --> 01:29.640]  Let's all go to the boat now.
[01:29.700 --> 01:30.480]  How do I put my...
[01:30.480 --> 01:31.840]  You wanna go to the boat now.
[01:32.040 --> 01:32.780]  I'm in a barrel.
[01:35.580 --> 01:37.780]  Oh, Andrew, you've already...
[01:37.780 --> 01:38.940]  The British Jackals.
[01:41.020 --> 01:41.980]  I take the damage.
[01:43.540 --> 01:44.720]  Well, what the hell was that?
[01:45.800 --> 01:46.120]  Ow.
[01:46.280 --> 01:47.400]  Oh, it's a monkey in a thing.
[01:47.740 --> 01:48.280]  Where there's a monkey?
[01:49.080 --> 01:49.560]  There's a way.
[01:49.640 --> 01:50.060]  Yeah, it's a dead.
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.240]  It's a skeleton monkey in that.
[01:51.400 --> 01:52.020]  I don't care about that.
[01:52.100 --> 01:52.860]  I don't see a regular monkey.
[01:52.880 --> 01:54.120]  I can put a monkey on the boat.
[01:54.120 --> 01:55.860]  Oh, cool. Unstable connection.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.440]  That's monkey on the car.
[01:58.720 --> 02:00.360]  Hey, what is it to grab the ladder?
[02:00.600 --> 02:01.000]  X.
[02:01.180 --> 02:01.780]  X, I think.
[02:04.340 --> 02:05.360]  We go. It is X.
[02:05.540 --> 02:06.500]  We're going to get it.
[02:06.580 --> 02:06.720]  OK.
[02:08.060 --> 02:09.620]  Take this food, please.
[02:10.320 --> 02:11.480]  How do I take?
[02:11.920 --> 02:12.780]  Hey, hold X.
[02:13.040 --> 02:14.520]  Oh my God, it's Louie.
[02:15.340 --> 02:16.620]  I forgot about Louie.
[02:16.700 --> 02:17.300]  This is pretty cool.
[02:17.380 --> 02:18.160]  He just hangs out, huh?
[02:18.540 --> 02:20.020]  Just hangs out, does whatever you want.
[02:20.840 --> 02:23.120]  Yeah, Louie is in a video
[02:23.120 --> 02:24.420]  that will never come out.
[02:24.560 --> 02:25.020]  That's right.
[02:25.300 --> 02:25.920]  Oh, that's right.
[02:26.520 --> 02:29.540]  We did a whole bunch of this game that no one's ever going to see.
[02:30.420 --> 02:31.680]  Oh, no, I put Louie away.
[02:31.740 --> 02:32.580]  How do I bring Louie back?
[02:34.180 --> 02:34.700]  I got him.
[02:35.580 --> 02:37.240]  Oh, I fell off the boat.
[02:40.160 --> 02:41.400]  Louie will remember you.
[02:41.580 --> 02:41.740]  Is the game in?
[02:45.100 --> 02:47.740]  I walked the plank, but I didn't mean to.
[02:48.120 --> 02:50.260]  What's our what high seas adventure are we up to?
[02:51.260 --> 02:52.580]  Let's first raise anchor
[02:52.580 --> 02:55.660]  and then we can kind of look around, see if there's any in-world events we can do.
[02:56.820 --> 02:58.460]  OK, are you raising the anchor?
[02:58.900 --> 02:59.660]  I sure am.
[02:59.780 --> 03:00.300]  Do you need help?
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.560]  I'd be great. Thank you.
[03:02.980 --> 03:03.520]  All right, cool.
[03:04.100 --> 03:05.400]  This is good. You guys are doing great. Keep going.
[03:06.040 --> 03:07.060]  Why aren't we going much faster?
[03:08.560 --> 03:10.160]  Me and Louie, me and Louie are watching.
[03:10.260 --> 03:10.980]  You guys are doing great.
[03:13.060 --> 03:14.140]  He's clapping for you.
[03:14.240 --> 03:14.800]  You're having fun.
[03:15.160 --> 03:16.620]  Well, we got this is going to be a really good video.
[03:16.780 --> 03:19.800]  It just says unstable connection in the upper left hand corner of my screen
[03:19.800 --> 03:20.800]  the entire time.
[03:21.740 --> 03:22.920]  That's really good stuff.
[03:23.480 --> 03:26.000]  Captain Briggsie has a that's how it felt like for me to play Call of Duty.
[03:26.080 --> 03:28.960]  Captain Briggsie has a rousing adventure for us.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.940]  The hunt for the skull of the siren song.
[03:31.040 --> 03:31.800]  Oh, you say no to that?
[03:32.060 --> 03:33.260]  Yeah, I'm saying no to that.
[03:33.400 --> 03:36.260]  Rousing is not how I'd describe that adventure personally.
[03:36.640 --> 03:37.040]  Oh, yeah.
[03:37.440 --> 03:39.320]  Would you describe it as 30 times?
[03:39.700 --> 03:42.200]  Oh, 30 times or like 20.
[03:42.520 --> 03:43.340]  I did a lot.
[03:43.840 --> 03:44.660]  There's a rat.
[03:45.080 --> 03:46.200]  There's a rat down here.
[03:46.340 --> 03:47.820]  Can Louie eat the rat or something?
[03:48.220 --> 03:49.220]  Oh, they just hang out.
[03:49.340 --> 03:50.220]  They're just talking about you.
[03:50.220 --> 03:52.800]  Is there an achievement to do it 20 times?
[03:53.380 --> 03:53.400]  Yeah.
[03:54.440 --> 03:54.920]  Why?
[03:56.100 --> 03:57.280]  You should ask them.
[03:58.720 --> 04:00.860]  Do this specific achievement 20 times.
[04:01.260 --> 04:02.120]  Oh, did we take off?
[04:02.840 --> 04:03.420]  Yeah, we're moving.
[04:04.200 --> 04:04.760]  Oh, that's fun.
[04:05.200 --> 04:05.820]  Is anybody driving?
[04:08.480 --> 04:09.440]  Let's go right.
[04:09.840 --> 04:12.140]  Let's go to that that vortex looking thing.
[04:12.660 --> 04:13.560]  What vortex thing?
[04:13.720 --> 04:14.460]  Oh, that thing.
[04:15.760 --> 04:18.520]  It's a lot of sails, getting the sails going.
[04:18.940 --> 04:19.920]  Oh, I did that up here.
[04:19.920 --> 04:21.400]  I did it. That was great.
[04:21.860 --> 04:24.280]  I can't see shit with the sails all the way down.
[04:24.380 --> 04:25.720]  Somebody else needs to be shorter.
[04:26.400 --> 04:27.080]  You got it.
[04:28.600 --> 04:29.520]  All right, here we go, boys.
[04:29.680 --> 04:30.840]  I'm going to get that wind.
[04:31.540 --> 04:32.180]  OK, where are we going?
[04:32.540 --> 04:33.240]  Here we go.
[04:33.560 --> 04:36.520]  Anyone wants to go to that shimmering spiral thing?
[04:36.700 --> 04:37.480]  You want to go to the shimmering thing?
[04:38.080 --> 04:40.660]  Could you go northwest from where we're currently at?
[04:41.180 --> 04:41.980]  Yeah, I'm going. I'm going.
[04:42.060 --> 04:43.580]  I'm going left. I'm holding left.
[04:43.680 --> 04:44.480]  I'm keep going left.
[04:44.600 --> 04:45.800]  I don't like what am I supposed to?
[04:45.880 --> 04:47.360]  What am I doing that's not right here?
[04:48.140 --> 04:48.960]  How's that for you?
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.000]  Oh, it just takes a really long time.
[04:51.120 --> 04:51.720]  Oh, there we go.
[04:51.820 --> 04:52.600]  Jesus Christ.
[04:54.240 --> 04:56.020]  Yeah, but like you just keep fucking turning the thing
[04:56.020 --> 04:57.280]  before it starts doing anything.
[04:57.580 --> 04:58.820]  Can you see a little bit better now?
[05:00.060 --> 05:02.960]  I mean, I'm just I'm just I'm watching the compass.
[05:03.100 --> 05:04.140]  I'm trying to go left or right.
[05:04.980 --> 05:06.840]  I'm trying. I'm going all the way left.
[05:07.260 --> 05:08.140]  Yeah, it's all good.
[05:08.340 --> 05:10.000]  I'm going to go up and get a good view of our death.
[05:10.720 --> 05:11.980]  I'm going to make Louie bite you guys.
[05:12.080 --> 05:12.660]  This is fucked up.
[05:12.720 --> 05:14.180]  I'm going to go ahead and get some wooden planks.
[05:14.480 --> 05:16.260]  Wow, Louie would never betray me.
[05:16.740 --> 05:18.300]  This crow's nest is so high.
[05:19.140 --> 05:20.260]  That's kind of the point.
[05:21.660 --> 05:22.820]  Oh, a crow.
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.520]  But yeah, to win.
[05:27.760 --> 05:31.540]  So there's like there's like no there's like no nuance or subtlety to like this boat.
[05:31.640 --> 05:34.080]  You just got to crank it all the way left forever, all the way right forever.
[05:34.300 --> 05:34.800]  And that's it.
[05:35.920 --> 05:36.880]  You just described sailing.
[05:37.420 --> 05:38.900]  Yeah, sailing fucking sucks.
[05:39.320 --> 05:41.080]  Oh, that's why we invented cars.
[05:41.420 --> 05:42.280]  God, no kidding.
[05:42.460 --> 05:43.360]  Can we play a car game?
[05:45.200 --> 05:47.440]  Because sailing across land would be even dumber.
[05:47.440 --> 05:49.640]  So what shimmering thing am I going to?
[05:49.760 --> 05:51.040]  The thing on the left is a bunch of rocks.
[05:51.400 --> 05:52.720]  Just pass the thing shooting at us.
[05:53.080 --> 05:54.580]  Oh, oh, I didn't know it was shooting at us.
[05:54.580 --> 05:56.080]  I'm sorry. I didn't know it was doing that.
[05:56.520 --> 05:59.460]  That's OK. If you just steer a little, little further right, we'll be fine.
[05:59.760 --> 06:01.340]  You think you think we can get all the way around it?
[06:01.520 --> 06:02.100]  Right. Yeah.
[06:02.160 --> 06:02.880]  Oh, just go straight.
[06:03.060 --> 06:03.660]  Perfect. Yeah.
[06:03.660 --> 06:05.000]  If you can line us up straight now.
[06:05.420 --> 06:06.280]  What are the odds of getting hit?
[06:06.500 --> 06:09.440]  Oh, oh, well, we just got hit.
[06:10.180 --> 06:11.100]  Pretty high, apparently.
[06:11.840 --> 06:12.820]  Guys, you're taking on water.
[06:12.920 --> 06:13.480]  Come on. We are.
[06:14.700 --> 06:18.300]  Oh, oh, just watch Nick fall from the crows.
[06:18.420 --> 06:19.660]  Nick, Nick is the crow.
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.660]  Oh, as the crow falls.
[06:23.540 --> 06:25.580]  As the crow falls.
[06:26.140 --> 06:28.700]  I don't see us taking on any water down here.
[06:28.880 --> 06:29.140]  No? OK.
[06:31.120 --> 06:32.420]  Your ship is taking on water.
[06:32.520 --> 06:34.660]  Use a plank of wood to repair the hole before you sink.
[06:34.700 --> 06:35.300]  That's all it says.
[06:35.620 --> 06:36.520]  Definitely taking on water.
[06:36.660 --> 06:36.820]  OK.
[06:38.260 --> 06:40.140]  We're we're heading straight on.
[06:41.980 --> 06:42.920]  Once again, I'm not.
[06:42.920 --> 06:43.680]  Oh, there's a hole.
[06:43.980 --> 06:44.940]  Sea in this hole.
[06:45.200 --> 06:46.060]  Is it a bottomless sea?
[06:46.340 --> 06:47.040]  Yeah, it was up top.
[06:47.500 --> 06:48.580]  OK, and up top hole.
[06:48.700 --> 06:49.740]  I don't I don't know about that.
[06:49.980 --> 06:51.620]  Yeah, but how is it taking on water if it's up top?
[06:51.960 --> 06:52.900]  Yeah, it doesn't make no sense.
[06:53.040 --> 06:53.900]  No, there's water.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.100]  There's water all over the place, man.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.640]  Any damage here? No.
[06:58.220 --> 06:59.040]  Like it here.
[06:59.240 --> 07:00.800]  Potentially, it's taken on air.
[07:01.880 --> 07:03.140]  Boat's taking on air right now.
[07:03.500 --> 07:04.600]  Yeah, the boat's taking on too much air.
[07:04.660 --> 07:05.240]  Can we fix that?
[07:06.680 --> 07:07.000]  Airboat?
[07:08.440 --> 07:09.240]  You want me to drop the anchor?
[07:09.920 --> 07:10.220]  No.
[07:11.120 --> 07:11.620]  Because I'll do it.
[07:12.380 --> 07:13.860]  I don't doubt it.
[07:14.480 --> 07:16.820]  Although right now, don't even think about it.
[07:19.460 --> 07:20.940]  We're still heading straight on for that thing.
[07:21.000 --> 07:21.720]  Yeah, we're doing good.
[07:23.520 --> 07:26.560]  We can tilt the sails again to catch wind so we go faster.
[07:27.200 --> 07:28.020]  I'm into that.
[07:29.380 --> 07:31.260]  I'm glad Andrew's finally playing this game with us.
[07:31.400 --> 07:32.820]  He decided that we're good enough now.
[07:32.860 --> 07:34.360]  Yeah, I don't know why he held off for so long.
[07:34.700 --> 07:35.560]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[07:35.840 --> 07:39.440]  I was beginning to wonder if it was a dream that was never going to become a reality for me.
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.600]  I love this game.
[07:41.720 --> 07:42.780]  Just not with us.
[07:43.100 --> 07:44.860]  Yeah, I love this game with us.
[07:47.540 --> 07:51.040]  I think you like this game so much that we annoy you in it.
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.200]  No, not at all.
[07:53.460 --> 07:54.120]  He hesitated.
[07:55.020 --> 07:55.900]  Yeah, he took too long.
[07:55.920 --> 07:58.260]  Oh, it's because I was trying to like make sure the sails were level.
[07:58.840 --> 07:59.380]  Oh, OK.
[07:59.560 --> 08:00.980]  Or maybe he needs to reboot his computer.
[08:01.080 --> 08:02.540]  Maybe because he likes this game so much.
[08:02.580 --> 08:03.800]  If I want to be real annoying, I get him.
[08:04.040 --> 08:04.700]  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
[08:05.480 --> 08:06.460]  Oh, you guys.
[08:06.980 --> 08:07.880]  Oh, is it feeding time?
[08:08.460 --> 08:09.120]  It's feeding time.
[08:09.460 --> 08:11.260]  It's feeding time.
[08:11.260 --> 08:12.820]  The little Caesars is here.
[08:13.640 --> 08:14.540]  Feed the pigs.
[08:15.440 --> 08:15.840]  Caesars?
[08:16.500 --> 08:18.980]  You know, it looked a lot closer when we were back there.
[08:19.220 --> 08:20.060]  Yeah, that can happen.
[08:20.440 --> 08:21.660]  You can be deceptive that way.
[08:22.840 --> 08:26.840]  I think I think the idea of sailing the ocean in a ship this size
[08:26.840 --> 08:28.860]  freaks me the hell out.
[08:29.160 --> 08:29.940]  Really? Oh, really?
[08:30.120 --> 08:30.620]  Oh, yeah.
[08:31.060 --> 08:31.820]  I'm with you.
[08:32.000 --> 08:33.480]  It just it's it doesn't bother me at all.
[08:34.260 --> 08:36.300]  It makes you feel so insignificant.
[08:36.580 --> 08:37.340]  Like it's crazy.
[08:38.100 --> 08:40.580]  And if I die, no one will ever know.
[08:41.260 --> 08:42.360]  Yeah, they'll never find you.
[08:42.860 --> 08:43.940]  You just die out here and that's it.
[08:44.080 --> 08:44.380]  That's it.
[08:44.560 --> 08:45.380]  Happens all the time.
[08:45.560 --> 08:47.400]  You're just as insignificant on land.
[08:48.100 --> 08:50.440]  Yeah, but on land, I like the scope of it.
[08:50.540 --> 08:56.580]  I can like handle like in my brain in like the ocean is like vast and endless.
[08:56.940 --> 08:57.960]  Well, think of it this way.
[08:57.980 --> 08:59.920]  When you're in the ocean, you're still on land.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.100]  You're just way above it.
[09:01.820 --> 09:04.140]  Right. It's like flying, which Nick is also afraid of.
[09:04.280 --> 09:05.640]  You're in the sky of the water.
[09:06.680 --> 09:07.760]  No, it's not the flying.
[09:07.940 --> 09:09.980]  It's the it's the enclosed space.
[09:11.460 --> 09:12.220]  Okay, you will.
[09:12.300 --> 09:14.160]  You're definitely not enclosed on a plane.
[09:14.420 --> 09:14.900]  Open around here.
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.180]  Oh, we're not talking about planes.
[09:16.260 --> 09:16.860]  We're talking about boats.
[09:17.820 --> 09:19.500]  Eric said, I'm also scared of flying.
[09:20.120 --> 09:20.660]  Oh, are you?
[09:21.140 --> 09:23.320]  No, I just have anxiety about flying.
[09:24.240 --> 09:25.380]  Sounds like a different thing.
[09:25.980 --> 09:28.080]  No, I'm not scared.
[09:28.220 --> 09:29.040]  I just don't want to do it.
[09:29.100 --> 09:29.600]  I don't like it.
[09:29.760 --> 09:33.480]  And it's not a problem until I'm on the plane.
[09:33.480 --> 09:35.080]  And then suddenly it's like, oh, the door's closed.
[09:35.140 --> 09:35.860]  Oh, it's tight in here.
[09:36.040 --> 09:38.660]  Oh, well, man, I just watched fucking.
[09:38.980 --> 09:39.760]  Nope, I don't want to hear it.
[09:39.760 --> 09:40.220]  I don't know.
[09:41.700 --> 09:42.220]  Hold on.
[09:42.260 --> 09:43.080]  Let me take my headphones off.
[09:43.120 --> 09:43.580]  You tell them.
[09:43.740 --> 09:44.100]  Yeah, that's fine.
[09:44.100 --> 09:45.900]  We only have to fly really soon.
[09:46.100 --> 09:48.040]  So yeah, definitely do this to him.
[09:48.120 --> 09:48.300]  Great.
[09:48.500 --> 09:49.020]  I'm not doing anything.
[09:49.180 --> 09:49.740]  I'm not doing anything.
[09:49.980 --> 09:50.200]  Okay.
[09:51.340 --> 09:54.500]  I just watched all five final destinations to get ready for.
[09:54.580 --> 09:54.920]  Oh, okay.
[09:54.940 --> 09:55.320]  That's fine.
[09:55.420 --> 09:55.760]  Yeah, that's fine.
[09:55.860 --> 09:56.260]  Yeah.
[09:57.820 --> 10:03.160]  Online, they set the record for oldest stunt woman to do a full burn, full body burn.
[10:03.280 --> 10:04.120]  Whoa, 71.
[10:04.940 --> 10:05.740]  Wow, really?
[10:05.980 --> 10:06.260]  Wow.
[10:06.440 --> 10:07.640]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[10:07.960 --> 10:08.640]  That is pretty cool.
[10:08.640 --> 10:10.040]  Now, fire also scared.
[10:13.200 --> 10:15.520]  Nick is scared of old ladies.
[10:16.740 --> 10:23.820]  Well, after the experience at Palo Duro Canyon, after they leave milf age, then it's just sort of like he doesn't like that anymore.
[10:23.860 --> 10:25.940]  When they transition from milf to gilf.
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.400]  Yeah, I'm out of here.
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.040]  I became scared of old ladies when two of them kind of hugged the monkey in a weird way.
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.520]  Oh, man, when we were going out to Colorado and they just want to get a picture with the monkey and they were loving the monkey.
[10:38.520 --> 10:41.220]  Do you remember the Gabriel song, hug the monkey?
[10:43.200 --> 10:44.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[10:44.480 --> 10:45.740]  How close are we?
[10:46.780 --> 10:48.400]  I mean, it's getting bigger and closer.
[10:49.660 --> 10:50.960]  Getting closer every day.
[10:52.900 --> 10:54.820]  A little bit closer.
[10:55.020 --> 10:57.360]  Let me pull out my spyglass and look.
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.420]  It's not fun to like steer this ship, but at the same time, like it's probably not fun just waiting.
[11:02.680 --> 11:03.580]  You just kind of wait.
[11:04.100 --> 11:09.300]  That while you do repairs and stuff and play music, look through the spyglass.
[11:09.460 --> 11:11.300]  I just see you guys like jumping around.
[11:11.580 --> 11:13.740]  That's all. No one else is doing anything is for jumping.
[11:15.820 --> 11:17.180]  We're testing floorboards.
[11:17.560 --> 11:18.700]  Make sure they're solid again.
[11:19.380 --> 11:20.420]  Guys, we're getting pretty close.
[11:21.620 --> 11:23.500]  I'd say before long, we'll be there.
[11:24.320 --> 11:25.280]  Oh, I see him.
[11:25.400 --> 11:27.860]  I'm supervising Eric ships coming up.
[11:27.980 --> 11:28.440]  Doing good.
[11:29.040 --> 11:30.520]  I got two of them.
[11:30.660 --> 11:31.200]  Go ships.
[11:31.300 --> 11:31.840]  Do we have any?
[11:32.420 --> 11:32.740]  Ghost.
[11:33.260 --> 11:33.880]  Do we have any?
[11:34.540 --> 11:35.520]  What do we need to do?
[11:36.060 --> 11:37.960]  Wait, what am I supposed to do?
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.360]  I'm just driving straight to it, right?
[11:40.000 --> 11:40.820]  They're off to the side.
[11:40.900 --> 11:42.340]  They may not be able to engage us in time.
[11:42.440 --> 11:43.120]  You drive to it.
[11:43.200 --> 11:44.460]  Eric, I can take the wheel if you want.
[11:44.520 --> 11:45.160]  You can do shooting.
[11:45.640 --> 11:46.100]  Yeah, sure.
[11:46.240 --> 11:46.760]  That sounds fine.
[11:47.260 --> 11:47.920]  It's all yours.
[11:48.300 --> 11:49.660]  You remember that Carrie Underwood song?
[11:49.720 --> 11:50.420]  Eric, take the wheel.
[11:50.920 --> 11:52.220]  Yeah, that's pretty.
[11:52.240 --> 11:55.100]  Should I be on the should I be on the bow or the stern here?
[11:57.000 --> 11:57.800]  Wherever you want.
[11:57.900 --> 11:58.160]  Really?
[11:58.240 --> 11:58.980]  It doesn't really matter.
[11:59.880 --> 12:02.420]  It'll depend when we're fighting more than currently.
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.340]  Oh, there are go ships.
[12:07.500 --> 12:08.340]  Load the cannons.
[12:08.740 --> 12:08.900]  Yeah.
[12:09.080 --> 12:10.080]  Is this the thing we wanted?
[12:10.300 --> 12:10.740]  Load them.
[12:10.880 --> 12:11.020]  Yep.
[12:12.200 --> 12:12.840]  Use cannon.
[12:12.980 --> 12:13.520]  Use cannon.
[12:13.720 --> 12:14.200]  Is there a button?
[12:14.280 --> 12:15.880]  Is there like a different button to load cannon or?
[12:17.020 --> 12:17.740]  Yeah, cannonballs.
[12:17.900 --> 12:18.580]  It's in the second.
[12:19.160 --> 12:20.080]  Go down the stairs.
[12:20.600 --> 12:23.040]  Oh, so you do have the red crates.
[12:23.320 --> 12:23.760]  Don't worry.
[12:23.940 --> 12:25.300]  I think we're fully loaded now.
[12:25.420 --> 12:26.140]  Yeah, we're all loaded.
[12:26.800 --> 12:27.520]  But you'll want ammo.
[12:27.740 --> 12:27.880]  Yeah.
[12:28.200 --> 12:28.360]  Okay.
[12:28.360 --> 12:28.960]  Yes.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.200]  If you just hang on to those, we can.
[12:30.460 --> 12:30.800]  Got him.
[12:31.160 --> 12:31.960]  Here we go, guys.
[12:32.340 --> 12:33.020]  Here they come.
[12:33.260 --> 12:33.920]  Oh shit.
[12:34.540 --> 12:36.320]  There's only on the left five of them.
[12:36.940 --> 12:37.800]  They're all over.
[12:39.580 --> 12:41.600]  One go straight ahead.
[12:41.620 --> 12:42.340]  What's the right?
[12:42.800 --> 12:44.280]  Yeah, I see that straight ahead.
[12:44.360 --> 12:45.000]  This is crazy.
[12:45.740 --> 12:46.620]  What's the harpoon do?
[12:46.800 --> 12:47.980]  Let's fuck worry about the harpoon.
[12:48.580 --> 12:54.760]  No, it you can get loot with it in the water or you can like grab stuff and pull or rescue people out of the water and stuff.
[12:55.060 --> 12:57.480]  Yeah, let's go ahead and kill these guys.
[12:57.480 --> 12:58.560]  I'm all right up.
[12:59.340 --> 13:02.260]  Here we go on the left coming up.
[13:06.050 --> 13:06.450]  Bitch.
[13:09.530 --> 13:11.630]  I'm pressing the button like a dipshit.
[13:11.730 --> 13:12.590]  You gotta hold it.
[13:12.910 --> 13:13.330]  You hold it.
[13:14.670 --> 13:15.470]  Right trigger.
[13:15.750 --> 13:16.990]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[13:17.050 --> 13:20.790]  Got it.
[13:20.950 --> 13:21.210]  Okay.
[13:22.930 --> 13:24.030]  Oh, where's wood?
[13:24.150 --> 13:24.970]  I need some wood.
[13:25.490 --> 13:26.870]  Oh, how we doing downstairs?
[13:27.010 --> 13:27.850]  We doing that bad downstairs?
[13:27.930 --> 13:28.270]  I'll come down.
[13:28.330 --> 13:28.650]  I got wood.
[13:29.490 --> 13:30.890]  We the mass took a hit.
[13:31.290 --> 13:32.530]  Okay, coming up on the right.
[13:32.610 --> 13:33.290]  I see it.
[13:33.470 --> 13:34.390]  I'm gonna write cannons.
[13:34.630 --> 13:36.130]  Okay, what y'all can y'all fire?
[13:36.290 --> 13:36.850]  I'll do repairs.
[13:36.950 --> 13:38.350]  Oh, it's firing downstairs.
[13:39.070 --> 13:39.510]  All right.
[13:39.550 --> 13:39.850]  Don't worry.
[13:39.890 --> 13:40.350]  I got it.
[13:40.390 --> 13:41.030]  I got it.
[13:41.130 --> 13:41.910]  Fucking ghost.
[13:44.270 --> 13:44.990]  Too much.
[13:45.990 --> 13:47.990]  All right, are we taking on any more water?
[13:48.050 --> 13:49.210]  We are we are we are we are.
[13:49.290 --> 13:50.950]  Okay, let's reload these cannons.
[13:51.150 --> 13:52.510]  If we can do it down here now.
[13:52.510 --> 13:52.990]  How we doing?
[13:53.070 --> 13:53.990]  We're looking good.
[13:54.290 --> 13:55.290]  If you guys look fire.
[13:56.070 --> 13:57.030]  Okay, fire fire.
[13:57.650 --> 13:58.690]  Oh, what do we do with the fire?
[13:59.350 --> 14:01.510]  There's a water bucket downstairs.
[14:01.690 --> 14:02.830]  You can scoop from it.
[14:04.170 --> 14:07.450]  So right trigger to scoop and then left trigger to yeah, if
[14:07.450 --> 14:09.770]  you want to feel free to use all the water in the bottom of
[14:09.770 --> 14:10.010]  the ship.
[14:10.070 --> 14:10.470]  Oh, no, man.
[14:10.510 --> 14:10.870]  I got it out.
[14:13.570 --> 14:13.930]  Nice.
[14:14.410 --> 14:15.450]  We blew that guy away.
[14:17.750 --> 14:18.990]  Do we take that boat out?
[14:19.050 --> 14:19.710]  Is it fucking done?
[14:19.810 --> 14:19.990]  Yep.
[14:20.130 --> 14:20.770]  It's that's awesome.
[14:21.210 --> 14:22.090]  Only takes two shots.
[14:22.210 --> 14:23.290]  Case for the right.
[14:26.790 --> 14:27.670]  I just missed him.
[14:29.730 --> 14:30.630]  Pretty far away.
[14:30.730 --> 14:31.030]  I got it.
[14:31.410 --> 14:32.670]  Yeah, excited.
[14:33.830 --> 14:34.950]  That's probably too far.
[14:36.170 --> 14:36.830]  Oh, yep.
[14:36.930 --> 14:37.270]  Sure is.
[14:38.170 --> 14:38.450]  Wait.
[14:38.930 --> 14:39.530]  Oh, wait.
[14:39.570 --> 14:41.430]  I can stand back here and load cannonballs for you guys.
[14:41.930 --> 14:42.170]  Yep.
[14:42.490 --> 14:43.250]  That's crazy.
[14:43.510 --> 14:44.030]  How about here?
[14:45.330 --> 14:46.270]  Here loading cannonball.
[14:46.590 --> 14:48.210]  Close and coming back.
[14:48.510 --> 14:48.830]  Geoff, you loaded.
[14:49.230 --> 14:49.610]  Thank you.
[14:52.850 --> 14:53.730]  Loading cannonball.
[14:54.750 --> 14:55.750]  Geoff, you should wait.
[14:56.230 --> 14:56.550]  Yeah.
[14:56.690 --> 14:57.470]  What do we get a bit closer?
[14:59.370 --> 15:01.050]  Okay, we got one coming up on our right.
[15:01.170 --> 15:02.030]  We should be able to get it.
[15:02.070 --> 15:02.850]  Yeah, here he comes.
[15:03.050 --> 15:03.250]  Cannons.
[15:03.490 --> 15:05.850]  Geoff, I'll get these second two if you want to get the first two.
[15:06.610 --> 15:06.790]  Okay.
[15:08.230 --> 15:09.210]  Okay, here he comes.
[15:09.470 --> 15:09.810]  All right.
[15:09.890 --> 15:10.750]  Wait for it.
[15:11.350 --> 15:12.030]  You gotta wait.
[15:12.390 --> 15:13.450]  He's not in front of me yet.
[15:15.950 --> 15:16.310]  Fire!
[15:18.050 --> 15:18.590]  Got him.
[15:21.250 --> 15:21.610]  Nice.
[15:25.500 --> 15:26.240]  Not off the ship.
[15:26.340 --> 15:26.560]  It's okay.
[15:29.040 --> 15:30.040]  That's so far, Geoff.
[15:30.040 --> 15:30.620]  How you shooting that?
[15:30.680 --> 15:31.120]  That's crazy.
[15:31.800 --> 15:32.500]  I got him.
[15:32.700 --> 15:33.420]  I hit him.
[15:35.420 --> 15:36.560]  Hey, too much.
[15:36.800 --> 15:37.580]  I've got more coming in.
[15:41.410 --> 15:41.950]  He's gone.
[15:44.790 --> 15:45.590]  Good shot.
[15:47.990 --> 15:49.070]  I'm out of cannonballs.
[15:49.150 --> 15:49.690]  Oh, shit.
[15:49.770 --> 15:50.190]  Here they come.
[15:50.350 --> 15:51.110]  Oh, we're hit.
[15:51.770 --> 15:52.810]  Oh, they're ghosting us.
[15:54.250 --> 15:55.430]  Oh, that hit me directly.
[15:55.670 --> 15:56.890]  Where do you pick up wood again, Geoff?
[15:57.750 --> 15:59.690]  From the wood barrel downstairs.
[16:00.030 --> 16:01.190]  There's a wood barrel, huh?
[16:01.730 --> 16:03.790]  Oh, there's a boat coming right for us.
[16:03.830 --> 16:04.010]  Yeah.
[16:04.690 --> 16:05.410]  Looks like he's...
[16:06.050 --> 16:06.310]  Damn.
[16:06.390 --> 16:07.790]  I don't think we're gonna be able to get him at this angle.
[16:10.930 --> 16:11.630]  Come on, Louie.
[16:11.670 --> 16:12.130]  What are we doing?
[16:12.650 --> 16:13.290]  All right.
[16:13.370 --> 16:13.990]  We gotta patch up.
[16:14.450 --> 16:14.930]  I'm patching.
[16:15.110 --> 16:16.010]  I'm going down to patch.
[16:16.330 --> 16:16.830]  We're gonna...
[16:16.830 --> 16:17.490]  We're almost done.
[16:17.650 --> 16:18.350]  You can stay up there.
[16:18.790 --> 16:18.930]  Okay.
[16:19.030 --> 16:20.390]  Well, I'm gonna grab some fucking...
[16:20.390 --> 16:21.350]  some of the water out of the bottom.
[16:22.110 --> 16:22.650]  Good idea.
[16:24.570 --> 16:25.730]  Okay, got cannonballs loaded.
[16:26.730 --> 16:28.910]  What a haphazard way to patch this ship.
[16:30.590 --> 16:31.990]  Oh, we're taking hits.
[16:33.470 --> 16:34.550]  Oh my God.
[16:34.630 --> 16:36.350]  Everything I do is undone instantly.
[16:36.750 --> 16:37.070]  Oh shit.
[16:39.790 --> 16:41.930]  Geoff, is the sound of running water good or bad?
[16:42.870 --> 16:43.410]  Oh, it's good.
[16:43.450 --> 16:44.210]  We're surrounded by water.
[16:44.330 --> 16:44.630]  So it's good.
[16:44.750 --> 16:45.170]  It's not good.
[16:45.430 --> 16:46.970]  Well, earlier you said we're surrounded by water.
[16:48.190 --> 16:48.630]  So...
[16:49.410 --> 16:50.810]  We want it outside the boat.
[16:52.970 --> 16:55.650]  Are we supposed to fight all of these ships?
[16:56.310 --> 16:56.630]  Yep.
[16:57.190 --> 16:57.410]  What?
[16:57.770 --> 16:58.630]  Only to the death.
[16:59.470 --> 16:59.970]  Oh, cool.
[17:01.070 --> 17:01.450]  All right.
[17:01.470 --> 17:02.130]  Is there anybody to kill?
[17:02.270 --> 17:02.550]  All right, here.
[17:02.690 --> 17:03.330]  Coming up on the left here.
[17:03.870 --> 17:04.750]  Yeah, coming up on the left.
[17:07.090 --> 17:07.510]  All right.
[17:07.510 --> 17:08.170]  You hit him once.
[17:08.230 --> 17:08.830]  I'll hit him twice.
[17:08.970 --> 17:09.850]  I'm gonna try.
[17:10.670 --> 17:11.730]  Yeah, here we go, boys.
[17:12.190 --> 17:13.290]  All right, firing now.
[17:14.870 --> 17:16.230]  Oh, I don't have any cannonballs in here.
[17:16.350 --> 17:16.570]  Fuck.
[17:17.150 --> 17:17.710]  I got it.
[17:19.070 --> 17:20.990]  Oh, it lit.
[17:20.990 --> 17:21.250]  Got him.
[17:22.770 --> 17:23.050]  Nice.
[17:23.270 --> 17:23.850]  Good job, fellas.
[17:25.330 --> 17:26.070]  GG, fellas.
[17:26.770 --> 17:28.130]  Got another guy coming right up our dicks.
[17:28.130 --> 17:29.190]  On the other side.
[17:29.350 --> 17:30.150]  Which side? Other side?
[17:30.390 --> 17:31.110]  Yeah, other side.
[17:31.550 --> 17:32.130]  Yeah, I see it.
[17:33.050 --> 17:33.670]  Put one in him.
[17:35.030 --> 17:35.850]  I don't think I can...
[17:35.850 --> 17:37.010]  I can't shoot him from this angle.
[17:37.990 --> 17:38.470]  He's only...
[17:38.470 --> 17:39.330]  He's only needs one more.
[17:39.430 --> 17:40.030]  Good repairs, Nate.
[17:40.030 --> 17:40.910]  Go around the other side.
[17:41.610 --> 17:41.830]  Yep.
[17:42.270 --> 17:42.770]  You got him.
[17:44.050 --> 17:44.910]  Come on around, dickhead.
[17:44.970 --> 17:45.810]  Oh, shit.
[17:45.850 --> 17:46.750]  I took a direct hit.
[17:46.950 --> 17:47.610]  The mast has hit.
[17:47.710 --> 17:48.370]  The mast has hit.
[17:48.790 --> 17:49.110]  Coming around.
[17:49.190 --> 17:50.230]  He's fucking up our ass.
[17:50.610 --> 17:50.790]  Yep.
[17:51.630 --> 17:52.350]  Oh, fuck, man.
[17:52.630 --> 17:53.290]  We're not gonna be able to get him.
[17:53.310 --> 17:54.430]  Oh, we're on fire down below.
[17:54.830 --> 17:55.350]  He's fucking us.
[17:55.350 --> 17:55.710]  Yeah, I got it.
[17:55.750 --> 17:56.010]  I got it.
[17:56.030 --> 17:56.910]  Right up the ass.
[17:56.910 --> 17:58.250]  Oh, that angle is fucked.
[17:58.430 --> 17:59.050]  I can't get him.
[17:59.290 --> 17:59.970]  Are we taking out water?
[18:00.170 --> 18:00.510]  The angle is fucked.
[18:00.510 --> 18:00.730]  I'm waiting.
[18:01.870 --> 18:03.410]  Okay, here comes another one on the left.
[18:03.810 --> 18:04.550]  It's coming into us.
[18:04.670 --> 18:05.390]  Fire, fire, fire.
[18:06.930 --> 18:07.490]  Oh, shit.
[18:07.510 --> 18:08.410]  Where'd he come from?
[18:08.910 --> 18:09.510]  What's going on?
[18:09.630 --> 18:09.850]  Out of nowhere.
[18:10.230 --> 18:11.470]  Where did that come from?
[18:11.610 --> 18:12.290]  Came out of nowhere.
[18:14.770 --> 18:16.290]  I need to patch up some stuff.
[18:16.510 --> 18:17.490]  Loading up cannonball.
[18:18.550 --> 18:19.670]  And let me know, Nick, if you get in there.
[18:19.670 --> 18:20.170]  Oh, my God.
[18:20.270 --> 18:20.790]  The whole...
[18:20.790 --> 18:21.830]  God damn it.
[18:22.010 --> 18:22.230]  Below deck.
[18:22.230 --> 18:23.250]  Another guy coming down to help, Nick.
[18:23.590 --> 18:24.670]  Where's the wood that I...
[18:24.670 --> 18:26.150]  Ah, Andrew, we're underwater.
[18:26.770 --> 18:27.130]  Yeah.
[18:27.730 --> 18:28.470]  I got you.
[18:28.590 --> 18:28.770]  All right.
[18:28.790 --> 18:29.110]  Got him.
[18:29.190 --> 18:29.730]  He's down.
[18:30.930 --> 18:31.870]  Nick, you patch up.
[18:31.990 --> 18:32.350]  I'll bucket.
[18:32.630 --> 18:33.550]  I need to...
[18:34.110 --> 18:36.290]  I'll get a little bit more before, and then I'll go.
[18:36.490 --> 18:37.330]  We got a fight.
[18:37.470 --> 18:38.550]  We have a fire up top.
[18:38.970 --> 18:39.950]  Okay, getting it.
[18:42.810 --> 18:44.150]  No, don't place the trinket.
[18:44.270 --> 18:44.590]  Damn you.
[18:44.730 --> 18:45.290]  Grab the wood.
[18:46.850 --> 18:47.730]  Oh, I can still hear one.
[18:48.110 --> 18:48.650]  Guys, it's...
[18:50.030 --> 18:51.630]  Yeah, there's a lot of water.
[18:51.890 --> 18:52.650]  Also running out of wood.
[18:53.030 --> 18:54.370]  Yeah, we took a lot of hits.
[18:54.930 --> 18:55.690]  Oh, Geoff, Geoff.
[18:55.690 --> 18:57.130]  We got another guy coming from this side.
[18:57.170 --> 18:58.570]  Okay, I just got to get some water out of here, man.
[18:58.630 --> 18:59.790]  This is... we're not going to be...
[19:01.950 --> 19:03.690]  Okay, I think I got...
[19:04.290 --> 19:05.010]  Yeah, good job, Nick.
[19:05.290 --> 19:05.650]  Thank you.
[19:05.850 --> 19:07.390]  I'll try to fire and then get the next one.
[19:07.450 --> 19:07.930]  Where are we at, Eric?
[19:08.130 --> 19:08.690]  Where is the...
[19:08.690 --> 19:10.130]  I'm on my side over here.
[19:10.430 --> 19:11.550]  I don't know how to...
[19:11.550 --> 19:12.210]  Oh, geez.
[19:13.010 --> 19:13.610]  Coming through.
[19:15.510 --> 19:15.930]  Oh, yeah.
[19:16.190 --> 19:16.490]  Away.
[19:17.630 --> 19:17.930]  Nice.
[19:18.270 --> 19:18.490]  Great.
[19:18.970 --> 19:19.390]  Is he dead?
[19:19.630 --> 19:19.810]  Nope.
[19:20.030 --> 19:20.630]  He is now, though.
[19:20.790 --> 19:21.350]  Ah, damn.
[19:21.430 --> 19:21.770]  We got him.
[19:21.790 --> 19:22.030]  Got him.
[19:22.410 --> 19:22.630]  Good work.
[19:23.290 --> 19:23.610]  Good work.
[19:24.130 --> 19:25.790]  Loaded that bad boy up.
[19:25.850 --> 19:27.070]  Okay, we doing okay on that side?
[19:27.170 --> 19:27.270]  Yeah.
[19:28.750 --> 19:29.550]  Loading cannonball.
[19:29.970 --> 19:30.370]  Good.
[19:31.170 --> 19:32.230]  Guys, we got all the...
[19:32.230 --> 19:33.490]  just about all the water out of the bottom.
[19:33.650 --> 19:34.910]  I think we're patched at the bottom.
[19:36.810 --> 19:37.210]  Sweet.
[19:38.030 --> 19:38.270]  Let's...
[19:38.270 --> 19:38.890]  Oh, we got some guys coming up on...
[19:38.890 --> 19:39.710]  Oh, we got some guys coming up on bottom now.
[19:39.810 --> 19:40.410]  Coming up on the right.
[19:41.670 --> 19:42.290]  Oh, shit.
[19:43.170 --> 19:43.910]  Both sides.
[19:44.370 --> 19:45.190]  Front and back.
[19:45.830 --> 19:46.630]  Oh, fuck.
[19:47.230 --> 19:48.130]  Okay, coming straight on.
[19:52.070 --> 19:53.350]  How did that miss?
[19:55.270 --> 19:55.950]  Oh, this is out.
[19:56.150 --> 19:56.390]  Shit.
[19:56.390 --> 19:56.730]  That's it.
[19:57.890 --> 19:58.590]  Okay, one.
[19:58.930 --> 19:59.630]  Come on, come on.
[19:59.710 --> 20:00.650]  I'm not gonna be able to get him.
[20:01.810 --> 20:03.070]  Whoa, where'd that guy come from?
[20:03.890 --> 20:05.210]  Out of fucking nowhere.
[20:06.030 --> 20:06.390]  Ugh.
[20:06.970 --> 20:08.510]  Gotta go get fucking cannonballs.
[20:09.590 --> 20:10.850]  Okay, let me patch this up.
[20:10.870 --> 20:12.030]  Wish there was a cannon on the ass.
[20:12.190 --> 20:13.230]  Why don't we have an ass cannon?
[20:13.990 --> 20:15.050]  It'd be perfect for this.
[20:16.250 --> 20:17.490]  Okay, we should be patched.
[20:17.490 --> 20:18.730]  Hey, another one coming up on the right.
[20:19.430 --> 20:19.970]  I see him.
[20:20.490 --> 20:20.770]  Yeah.
[20:23.430 --> 20:26.870]  Is there a faster way to get to my items than just going to the menu?
[20:27.290 --> 20:32.570]  You can go into the keys, or like controller settings.
[20:32.850 --> 20:33.330]  You got him, Geoff?
[20:33.730 --> 20:34.090]  Oh, okay.
[20:34.190 --> 20:34.330]  That's it.
[20:34.750 --> 20:35.070]  Nice.
[20:35.910 --> 20:36.250]  Way to go.
[20:37.190 --> 20:37.670]  Oh, this guy.
[20:39.190 --> 20:39.590]  What do you mean?
[20:39.630 --> 20:40.250]  That one has more health.
[20:40.570 --> 20:41.150]  There you go.
[20:41.170 --> 20:41.250]  Oh, shit.
[20:41.450 --> 20:41.950]  Okay, you got him.
[20:42.370 --> 20:43.150]  All right, this one's loaded.
[20:43.350 --> 20:44.150]  Oh, we got another one coming.
[20:44.970 --> 20:45.290]  Yeah.
[20:45.510 --> 20:45.670]  Where?
[20:45.750 --> 20:46.470]  Oh, never mind.
[20:46.470 --> 20:47.350]  He's going up on the right.
[20:47.630 --> 20:47.930]  Here we go.
[20:47.990 --> 20:48.330]  Far right.
[20:48.330 --> 20:48.410]  Okay.
[20:51.940 --> 20:52.860]  What are you, a loser?
[20:53.000 --> 20:53.940]  No, he's gone.
[20:54.060 --> 20:54.480]  Oh, they're leaving.
[20:54.620 --> 20:55.200]  He's scared.
[20:55.460 --> 20:56.060]  Did we do it?
[20:56.240 --> 20:57.080]  Did we leave the area?
[20:59.120 --> 20:59.840]  Fucking hell.
[20:59.900 --> 21:00.800]  Or did we win?
[21:04.020 --> 21:04.540]  Oh, boy.
[21:04.580 --> 21:05.400]  There's a lot of water down here.
[21:05.420 --> 21:06.380]  Vortex is still here.
[21:07.560 --> 21:08.320]  Oh, they're coming back.
[21:08.640 --> 21:09.000]  No!
[21:09.900 --> 21:10.820]  Damn it all.
[21:11.160 --> 21:11.400]  Oh.
[21:13.140 --> 21:13.800]  Where's the leak?
[21:13.860 --> 21:14.320]  There it is.
[21:15.220 --> 21:15.860]  Holy shit.
[21:15.960 --> 21:16.940]  A whole bunch of them coming up left.
[21:16.940 --> 21:17.260]  Left, left.
[21:17.260 --> 21:18.020]  Oh my god.
[21:18.320 --> 21:19.020]  No, let me...
[21:19.020 --> 21:19.680]  Okay, so it's just...
[21:19.700 --> 21:20.680]  It's just this left side?
[21:21.380 --> 21:21.420]  Yep.
[21:21.640 --> 21:22.200]  Alright, here they come.
[21:22.700 --> 21:23.540]  Oh, this one's got a...
[21:23.540 --> 21:24.860]  This is special when he's got a...
[21:24.860 --> 21:26.060]  Maybe there's like the boss or something.
[21:26.200 --> 21:26.580]  Oh, god.
[21:26.680 --> 21:27.060]  Oh, god.
[21:27.800 --> 21:28.540]  Nick, do you need help?
[21:28.780 --> 21:29.660]  I think...
[21:29.660 --> 21:30.600]  I think I stopped it.
[21:30.640 --> 21:31.740]  It's just full of water right now.
[21:32.220 --> 21:32.360]  Okay.
[21:35.820 --> 21:36.260]  I don't know.
[21:36.280 --> 21:37.300]  Some shit's happening to me.
[21:38.440 --> 21:39.040]  Oh my god.
[21:39.320 --> 21:39.820]  Oh, god.
[21:39.920 --> 21:41.260]  Keep your shots high, dudes.
[21:42.500 --> 21:43.320]  Am I on fire?
[21:43.460 --> 21:44.380]  You seem to be on fire.
[21:44.460 --> 21:44.780]  Go to the basement.
[21:44.780 --> 21:45.080]  Yeah, you're on fire.
[21:45.080 --> 21:45.480]  You'll be alright.
[21:45.940 --> 21:47.320]  Alright, I'm not on fire anymore.
[21:47.320 --> 21:47.840]  Woah.
[21:48.480 --> 21:49.460]  Maybe it'll evaporate.
[21:49.820 --> 21:50.820]  They all took off?
[21:50.980 --> 21:51.160]  I...
[21:51.160 --> 21:51.340]  What?
[21:51.980 --> 21:53.020]  We got a fire in the deck!
[21:55.460 --> 21:56.040]  Oh, fuck.
[21:56.080 --> 21:56.680]  I'm out of cannonballs.
[22:00.260 --> 22:00.960]  Oh, you got it?
[22:00.980 --> 22:01.180]  Nice.
[22:04.260 --> 22:05.460]  Alright, they're still back there.
[22:05.520 --> 22:07.520]  We should really be bigger crews than four on a ship.
[22:08.080 --> 22:08.560]  Yeah, no kidding.
[22:08.800 --> 22:09.440]  Load cannon.
[22:12.240 --> 22:12.840]  Oh, okay.
[22:12.960 --> 22:13.840]  You see where those...
[22:13.840 --> 22:14.660]  Oh my god.
[22:14.860 --> 22:15.120]  ...ghost things are?
[22:16.580 --> 22:18.740]  On the water, see the ghost things above the water?
[22:19.600 --> 22:20.120]  To the left?
[22:20.480 --> 22:20.900]  Uh-huh.
[22:20.920 --> 22:22.440]  That should be crates we can retrieve.
[22:22.560 --> 22:24.500]  Let's have somebody try to harpoon one of those up.
[22:24.660 --> 22:26.520]  Because we could use the resources.
[22:27.440 --> 22:28.640]  I'm almost dead.
[22:29.640 --> 22:30.520]  Oh, yeah.
[22:30.820 --> 22:31.480]  And they're...
[22:31.480 --> 22:33.180]  And they're coming right for us, boys.
[22:33.860 --> 22:34.640]  Eat a banana.
[22:35.080 --> 22:37.100]  So drop down and go to the food barrel.
[22:37.920 --> 22:39.460]  And then grab some food.
[22:40.420 --> 22:41.680]  And then you can eat it.
[22:42.300 --> 22:42.780]  Get health.
[22:43.820 --> 22:44.940]  What's the food barrel?
[22:45.400 --> 22:45.880]  It's a...
[22:45.880 --> 22:47.380]  It's a barrel with, like, food marked on it.
[22:47.400 --> 22:48.220]  It's over here by me, Eric.
[22:48.920 --> 22:50.140]  I don't know where you are.
[22:50.260 --> 22:51.740]  I'm in the right next to you.
[22:51.960 --> 22:52.200]  Oh, okay.
[22:52.260 --> 22:52.500]  Here we go.
[22:52.660 --> 22:53.140]  Thank you.
[22:56.480 --> 22:57.500]  Damn it to hell!
[22:57.580 --> 22:58.640]  Where is the leak?
[22:59.660 --> 23:00.580]  Okay, we got one.
[23:00.900 --> 23:01.140]  Yep.
[23:01.400 --> 23:02.260]  He's down.
[23:02.580 --> 23:02.700]  Ah!
[23:03.580 --> 23:04.320]  A new leak!
[23:05.420 --> 23:06.440]  Hit that big guy.
[23:06.760 --> 23:07.120]  Come on!
[23:08.740 --> 23:10.040]  I think maybe he's...
[23:11.500 --> 23:11.940]  Oh!
[23:13.780 --> 23:14.660]  We're underwater.
[23:15.780 --> 23:16.060]  Yep.
[23:16.960 --> 23:17.240]  Gotcha.
[23:17.300 --> 23:17.660]  We got him!
[23:17.660 --> 23:18.320]  Well, we got the big guy.
[23:18.400 --> 23:18.780]  We got the big guy.
[23:18.840 --> 23:19.400]  We got the big guy.
[23:19.500 --> 23:19.720]  Good deal.
[23:19.740 --> 23:20.580]  Nice, nice, nice.
[23:20.600 --> 23:23.400]  I'm out of...
[23:23.800 --> 23:25.040]  Let me go get some more...
[23:27.160 --> 23:27.440]  Cannons.
[23:28.720 --> 23:29.860]  Oh, we're out of regular cannons.
[23:29.960 --> 23:31.240]  Yeah, we definitely need to get those supplies.
[23:32.840 --> 23:33.840]  Oh, we have a...
[23:33.840 --> 23:34.620]  We have the heavy...
[23:34.620 --> 23:35.180]  Oh, guys.
[23:35.200 --> 23:36.360]  We got two boats coming right for us.
[23:36.860 --> 23:37.420]  Oh, boys.
[23:37.720 --> 23:38.220]  I'm on him.
[23:39.000 --> 23:39.980]  As soon as he gets around.
[23:42.620 --> 23:42.840]  All right.
[23:42.840 --> 23:43.440]  That's the end of him.
[23:43.440 --> 23:43.920]  Nice.
[23:44.660 --> 23:45.020]  Unload.
[23:46.120 --> 23:46.520]  Oh, God.
[23:46.580 --> 23:47.520]  He's coming right for us!
[23:48.120 --> 23:48.400]  Oh!
[23:51.060 --> 23:51.420]  Can't...
[23:51.420 --> 23:52.020]  Couldn't get to him.
[23:55.120 --> 23:55.480]  Uh...
[23:56.320 --> 23:57.860]  Okay, I got one of the things.
[23:58.200 --> 23:58.920]  Okay, good deal.
[23:59.040 --> 23:59.840]  It's a storage crate.
[23:59.980 --> 24:00.040]  Cool.
[24:00.040 --> 24:00.360]  Here you go.
[24:00.420 --> 24:01.480]  I loaded these up for you guys.
[24:01.740 --> 24:03.100]  There's cannons and wooden.
[24:03.140 --> 24:05.560]  I can't quite get to the other storage crate.
[24:05.640 --> 24:05.920]  Fuck.
[24:06.060 --> 24:06.400]  This thing.
[24:07.120 --> 24:08.080]  Okay, I'm gonna spin left.
[24:08.120 --> 24:08.900]  We got treasure in the water.
[24:08.940 --> 24:10.040]  If you can spin left, I can get it.
[24:10.400 --> 24:10.660]  Yeah.
[24:11.200 --> 24:11.560]  Spinning.
[24:12.540 --> 24:14.040]  Nick, can you check on the holes, please?
[24:14.200 --> 24:14.320]  Yeah.
[24:14.520 --> 24:14.720]  Looking.
[24:15.100 --> 24:15.780]  We have water.
[24:16.740 --> 24:17.500]  Don't sink.
[24:18.260 --> 24:19.060]  Don't sink.
[24:19.800 --> 24:20.600]  Don't sink.
[24:21.280 --> 24:22.080]  Don't sink.
[24:22.440 --> 24:23.320]  We're not sinking yet.
[24:23.660 --> 24:24.460]  No, I'm talking about the treasure.
[24:24.680 --> 24:25.020]  Oh, okay.
[24:26.880 --> 24:28.760]  Can I patch up the hole at the bottom?
[24:28.880 --> 24:29.300]  Nice job.
[24:29.500 --> 24:29.980]  Thank you.
[24:31.300 --> 24:32.280]  I'll empty us out.
[24:33.040 --> 24:33.680]  Got one.
[24:35.120 --> 24:35.520]  Woo!
[24:36.640 --> 24:37.400]  That was close.
[24:37.560 --> 24:38.700]  I got what I could from that angle.
[24:38.840 --> 24:39.460]  Oh, there's more coming.
[24:39.620 --> 24:39.800]  Shit.
[24:42.400 --> 24:42.940]  More what?
[24:43.080 --> 24:44.560]  Okay, I'm spinning us back around to the left.
[24:44.960 --> 24:45.560]  Oh, I see.
[24:45.840 --> 24:46.120]  There's...
[24:46.600 --> 24:47.280]  Trigger to the right.
[24:47.420 --> 24:47.840]  There's some on the right.
[24:48.220 --> 24:48.680]  Can't get to it.
[24:48.800 --> 24:49.300]  Can you get to it from the right?
[24:49.300 --> 24:49.640]  Coming out.
[24:49.760 --> 24:50.220]  There, you got it.
[24:51.460 --> 24:52.000]  I got it.
[24:52.100 --> 24:52.420]  You got it?
[24:52.500 --> 24:52.640]  Alright.
[24:53.640 --> 24:53.900]  Alright.
[24:54.840 --> 24:56.120]  Maybe I can get the one on the left now.
[24:57.320 --> 24:57.760]  Alright, we got it.
[24:57.820 --> 24:58.500]  Still not quite.
[24:59.260 --> 24:59.580]  Oh, no.
[24:59.980 --> 25:00.500]  Ships are back.
[25:01.080 --> 25:01.340]  Yeah.
[25:03.320 --> 25:03.600]  One.
[25:04.200 --> 25:04.480]  Two.
[25:04.480 --> 25:04.900]  He's gone.
[25:05.340 --> 25:05.720]  Good work.
[25:06.080 --> 25:06.640]  Oh, he's not?
[25:06.840 --> 25:07.200]  He's not dead.
[25:07.240 --> 25:07.880]  He's got more health.
[25:08.020 --> 25:08.360]  I got him.
[25:08.360 --> 25:08.580]  He's got more health.
[25:08.740 --> 25:09.140]  There we go.
[25:09.300 --> 25:09.720]  There he goes.
[25:09.840 --> 25:10.300]  The third hit.
[25:10.540 --> 25:10.800]  Alright, cool.
[25:10.880 --> 25:11.300]  Good work, boys.
[25:11.440 --> 25:12.180]  Good shots, fellas.
[25:12.820 --> 25:13.060]  Yep.
[25:14.580 --> 25:15.680]  Ooh, what is this?
[25:15.980 --> 25:17.240]  Storage crate of the damned.
[25:17.920 --> 25:18.780]  The hell is that?
[25:19.680 --> 25:22.200]  It's one of the treasure things that Andrew grabbed.
[25:22.400 --> 25:22.720]  Oh, okay.
[25:23.140 --> 25:26.440]  I'm hopping down to repair some holes quickly if someone wants to keep their eyes open for
[25:26.440 --> 25:27.340]  treasure in the water.
[25:28.020 --> 25:30.320]  Okay, this one had lots of good stuff in it.
[25:30.820 --> 25:31.140]  Yeah.
[25:31.560 --> 25:32.080]  Good, good, good.
[25:32.700 --> 25:33.940]  Need a coconut real fast.
[25:35.160 --> 25:35.380]  Okay.
[25:36.760 --> 25:38.460]  Load these bad boys up.
[25:39.940 --> 25:41.520]  Alright, we loaded on every side.
[25:41.980 --> 25:44.700]  Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded.
[25:44.980 --> 25:45.160]  Okay.
[25:46.220 --> 25:48.480]  I'm just going to bring this chest.
[25:49.460 --> 25:50.600]  Uh, it looks like...
[25:51.120 --> 25:52.080]  This storage...
[25:52.080 --> 25:52.800]  Oh, treasure to the right?
[25:52.920 --> 25:54.420]  Yeah, treasure over here.
[25:54.620 --> 25:55.700]  I don't know how to...
[25:55.700 --> 25:57.100]  I don't know how to aim for it.
[25:58.220 --> 26:01.060]  So, it kind of auto-aims if you just look in the right direction for it.
[26:01.340 --> 26:01.640]  Okay.
[26:04.580 --> 26:06.800]  Got some treasure on the left here.
[26:06.820 --> 26:07.280]  There we go.
[26:07.280 --> 26:07.840]  Got something.
[26:08.140 --> 26:08.760]  Just keep shooting it.
[26:09.020 --> 26:09.240]  Okay.
[26:10.640 --> 26:11.660]  They're behind us.
[26:13.240 --> 26:13.960]  I got...
[26:14.500 --> 26:14.860]  ...everything.
[26:15.000 --> 26:15.280]  Beautiful.
[26:15.280 --> 26:15.860]  Got everything there.
[26:16.200 --> 26:17.120]  Guys showing up on the left.
[26:18.140 --> 26:18.580]  Or on the right.
[26:18.580 --> 26:20.160]  I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you.
[26:20.260 --> 26:20.420]  Right.
[26:20.700 --> 26:21.200]  I'm with you.
[26:22.400 --> 26:22.760]  Okay.
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.160]  There's a lot of distance there, so we should have time.
[26:26.240 --> 26:27.100]  Just make sure the cannon...
[26:27.100 --> 26:28.980]  If you can, load the cannons up.
[26:29.640 --> 26:30.960]  All the cannons are loaded right now.
[26:31.040 --> 26:31.340]  I already checked.
[26:31.780 --> 26:32.100]  Great.
[26:32.460 --> 26:34.060]  All right, we're out of wood down here then.
[26:34.780 --> 26:37.120]  Yeah, so just use the storage crate that's up above.
[26:38.000 --> 26:38.280]  Okay.
[26:38.440 --> 26:40.680]  If you need to pick it up...
[26:41.240 --> 26:43.080]  Yeah, the glowing storage crate has a ton of stuff in it.
[26:43.180 --> 26:46.500]  Yeah, if you pick up the crate and then take it down lower, that might be faster.
[26:46.640 --> 26:46.780]  I'll do that.
[26:46.780 --> 26:48.860]  Geoff, it looks like they're going to come back around to this left side.
[26:49.300 --> 26:49.460]  Okay.
[26:50.360 --> 26:52.720]  I think that's all the holes patched.
[26:53.840 --> 26:54.160]  Nice.
[26:55.420 --> 26:56.660]  Okay, we'll see if we...
[26:56.660 --> 26:58.100]  We should wait, we should wait, we should wait.
[26:58.820 --> 27:00.300]  Okay, I'm turning us to our right.
[27:00.300 --> 27:03.060]  We got two boats coming up straight on us from the right.
[27:03.660 --> 27:04.260]  Oh, shit.
[27:06.280 --> 27:07.440]  Geoff, back over to this side.
[27:07.940 --> 27:10.420]  I think they're going to go in front of us to the other side.
[27:10.660 --> 27:12.520]  Yeah, I'm cutting, I'm cutting to get us straight.
[27:12.800 --> 27:14.060]  Get ready to unload from the front.
[27:14.060 --> 27:14.640]  I'm ready, I'm ready.
[27:17.060 --> 27:18.240]  Oh, he's going to ram us.
[27:18.880 --> 27:19.500]  No, no, we're good.
[27:19.640 --> 27:20.440]  He's going to go right through us.
[27:20.480 --> 27:20.880]  You're going to hit him.
[27:21.560 --> 27:21.840]  Fire.
[27:22.500 --> 27:22.780]  I can't.
[27:23.040 --> 27:24.220]  We don't have the angles wrong.
[27:25.600 --> 27:25.900]  Fire.
[27:28.360 --> 27:28.880]  Uh-oh.
[27:29.620 --> 27:31.000]  All right, we got him.
[27:31.220 --> 27:31.580]  Beautiful.
[27:32.180 --> 27:33.300]  Oh, shit, another one.
[27:33.820 --> 27:34.380]  That's okay.
[27:34.640 --> 27:35.320]  We got him.
[27:35.980 --> 27:36.700]  Nice shot.
[27:38.580 --> 27:39.520]  And he's down.
[27:39.780 --> 27:40.820]  No, fuck, how?
[27:41.140 --> 27:41.660]  They take three now.
[27:41.860 --> 27:42.140]  It's okay.
[27:42.340 --> 27:43.020]  Oh, my God.
[27:43.420 --> 27:43.640]  Okay.
[27:44.240 --> 27:45.040]  Oh, shit, that left.
[27:45.180 --> 27:45.540]  Oh, fuck.
[27:45.680 --> 27:46.120]  Oh, treasure.
[27:46.300 --> 27:46.860]  God damn it.
[27:48.140 --> 27:48.780]  We'll have to keep straight.
[27:48.820 --> 27:50.160]  Oh, there's a fire up top?
[27:50.320 --> 27:51.280]  Yep, getting it, getting it.
[27:52.620 --> 27:54.020]  All right, I've hatched a hole in the bottom.
[27:55.300 --> 27:55.860]  Good job, Nick.
[27:55.920 --> 27:56.480]  How's the fire?
[27:57.720 --> 27:58.280]  Fire's good.
[27:58.780 --> 27:59.180]  Okay.
[28:02.050 --> 28:02.450]  Okay.
[28:04.110 --> 28:07.630]  Okay, I think the sound of breaking means bad.
[28:08.170 --> 28:08.570]  Yeah.
[28:09.190 --> 28:10.370]  We got hit pretty hard, but we're doing fine.
[28:10.370 --> 28:11.870]  This ship is fucking us up.
[28:11.870 --> 28:12.410]  Got him.
[28:12.530 --> 28:13.310]  Having trouble hitting.
[28:13.310 --> 28:14.470]  I got him, I got him.
[28:15.190 --> 28:16.070]  Yep, just keep shooting.
[28:16.330 --> 28:16.750]  Nice shot.
[28:16.750 --> 28:18.050]  God, he's gone, he's gone.
[28:18.170 --> 28:18.990]  Ow, I got hit.
[28:19.850 --> 28:20.810]  You got treasure anywhere?
[28:21.030 --> 28:21.430]  No.
[28:21.930 --> 28:22.210]  Fire again.
[28:22.330 --> 28:23.330]  If you're hurt, be sure to eat.
[28:24.410 --> 28:24.970]  Oh, thank you.
[28:25.350 --> 28:25.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:27.190 --> 28:27.790]  Where's the fire?
[28:27.870 --> 28:29.510]  All right, if you got fire, I got water.
[28:29.510 --> 28:30.270]  You got it?
[28:30.510 --> 28:31.670]  Are these barrels?
[28:32.070 --> 28:32.290]  Yeah.
[28:35.610 --> 28:36.490]  Somebody, somebody...
[28:36.490 --> 28:36.950]  Oh, shit.
[28:37.370 --> 28:38.270]  Somebody's got a fucking egg.
[28:38.950 --> 28:39.850]  They're gonna be on this right?
[28:40.890 --> 28:41.970]  Hey, get back up to the wheel.
[28:44.850 --> 28:45.470]  Missed him.
[28:47.470 --> 28:48.290]  Come on.
[28:49.350 --> 28:50.130]  No water, no water.
[28:50.430 --> 28:51.410]  Oh, what a shot!
[28:51.750 --> 28:52.790]  What a shot!
[28:54.070 --> 28:54.510]  Unreal!
[28:55.810 --> 28:56.590]  Okay, pulling it right.
[28:58.890 --> 28:59.170]  Patch.
[28:59.810 --> 29:00.290]  Oh, shit.
[29:00.510 --> 29:01.030]  Got treasure up ahead.
[29:01.690 --> 29:02.350]  Hopping for it.
[29:02.550 --> 29:03.050]  Left or right?
[29:03.190 --> 29:03.430]  Left or right?
[29:03.670 --> 29:04.370]  Left, left, left.
[29:04.490 --> 29:05.110]  Get it, get it, get it, get it.
[29:05.110 --> 29:05.350]  Got it.
[29:05.390 --> 29:05.930]  Hit it, hit it.
[29:05.970 --> 29:06.730]  Hell yeah!
[29:07.070 --> 29:07.570]  He's gone.
[29:07.770 --> 29:08.490]  Fucked him up.
[29:08.510 --> 29:09.430]  Yeah, kill him, kill him.
[29:10.530 --> 29:11.370]  Come on, come on, come on.
[29:11.990 --> 29:12.490]  Come on.
[29:13.810 --> 29:16.110]  I'm tilting you back left, Eric, so it'll come back around in a moment.
[29:16.150 --> 29:16.330]  All right.
[29:19.830 --> 29:20.110]  Okay.
[29:21.430 --> 29:24.230]  Is there a point where we've beaten this?
[29:24.290 --> 29:24.790]  Or do you just...
[29:24.790 --> 29:25.150]  Yes.
[29:25.150 --> 29:25.630]  Okay.
[29:25.810 --> 29:26.770]  Oh, shit.
[29:26.970 --> 29:29.050]  Nick, it's not looking so good down there.
[29:29.110 --> 29:29.290]  Nope.
[29:29.950 --> 29:30.950]  Just patching other holes.
[29:31.630 --> 29:32.850]  I'm gonna help...
[29:32.850 --> 29:33.890]  I got it.
[29:34.050 --> 29:34.790]  All water.
[29:36.030 --> 29:39.350]  Eric, if you wanna keep a lookout on that harpoon for the treasure coming up on the left,
[29:39.510 --> 29:40.250]  that'd be awesome.
[29:40.510 --> 29:41.470]  All right, that should be enough water.
[29:41.470 --> 29:43.270]  We have a boat heading straight for us.
[29:44.630 --> 29:45.330]  I'm gonna patch it.
[29:45.470 --> 29:45.910]  Left or right?
[29:46.390 --> 29:46.990]  Where should I be?
[29:47.090 --> 29:50.110]  He's gonna be on the right quickly.
[29:50.470 --> 29:50.810]  On the right.
[29:50.950 --> 29:51.390]  I'm on the right.
[29:51.530 --> 29:51.870]  I got it.
[29:51.990 --> 29:52.150]  Okay.
[29:53.090 --> 29:53.730]  We'll be around.
[29:53.810 --> 29:54.730]  All right, I'll be with you.
[29:54.990 --> 29:55.210]  Just a second.
[29:55.550 --> 29:56.370]  All right, we're patched.
[29:56.390 --> 29:56.430]  Here he comes.
[29:56.990 --> 29:57.430]  Oh, no.
[29:57.670 --> 29:58.070]  Got him.
[29:59.150 --> 29:59.670]  One, two.
[29:59.790 --> 30:00.030]  Come on.
[30:00.090 --> 30:00.370]  Keep...
[30:00.370 --> 30:01.270]  Load up, load up, load up.
[30:01.290 --> 30:02.250]  One more, one more, one more.
[30:02.790 --> 30:03.190]  Got him.
[30:04.750 --> 30:05.290]  There we go.
[30:05.430 --> 30:05.830]  Good work.
[30:05.950 --> 30:06.230]  Okay.
[30:06.730 --> 30:07.790]  All right, I'm off him.
[30:08.530 --> 30:09.690]  Okay, keep an eye out for treasure.
[30:09.870 --> 30:10.910]  Looks like there's one coming right up on us.
[30:10.910 --> 30:11.390]  Oh, there you go.
[30:11.470 --> 30:11.970]  Yeah, I see it.
[30:12.070 --> 30:13.270]  Yeah, you keep doing what you're doing.
[30:18.980 --> 30:19.460]  Good shot.
[30:20.240 --> 30:20.800]  Thank you.
[30:21.040 --> 30:21.540]  All right, all right.
[30:21.620 --> 30:22.240]  Let's see into him.
[30:22.280 --> 30:22.360]  Nice.
[30:22.360 --> 30:22.700]  There we go.
[30:22.700 --> 30:23.000]  There we go.
[30:23.000 --> 30:23.660]  Good work, boys.
[30:25.060 --> 30:26.120]  Tons of treasure here.
[30:26.160 --> 30:26.720]  This is great.
[30:27.400 --> 30:27.760]  Okay.
[30:27.820 --> 30:28.520]  We're doing okay.
[30:28.720 --> 30:29.380]  We're doing okay.
[30:30.200 --> 30:31.280]  Don't forget to heal.
[30:32.040 --> 30:33.080]  Looking good down there.
[30:33.120 --> 30:33.640]  We're looking good.
[30:33.740 --> 30:34.520]  All the ships are gone.
[30:34.600 --> 30:35.260]  All the ships are gone.
[30:35.340 --> 30:36.360]  So now's the time for repairs.
[30:36.560 --> 30:36.720]  Yep.
[30:37.520 --> 30:39.160]  Repairs and also treasure pickup.
[30:39.680 --> 30:39.900]  Yep.
[30:40.340 --> 30:41.320]  I'll keep an eye out for treasure.
[30:41.440 --> 30:42.960]  I'm looking to see if there's any treasure.
[30:43.760 --> 30:44.640]  Load, load, load.
[30:44.640 --> 30:45.720]  I think we're all repaired.
[30:46.000 --> 30:46.380]  Load, load, load.
[30:46.540 --> 30:47.540]  Load, load, load.
[30:47.560 --> 30:49.260]  I don't see any here.
[30:49.280 --> 30:49.840]  It's to the right.
[30:51.800 --> 30:52.160]  To the right.
[30:52.160 --> 30:53.120]  Oh, I do see it to the right.
[30:54.260 --> 30:54.880]  Boat's coming.
[30:55.280 --> 30:55.800]  Oh, shit.
[30:56.140 --> 30:56.600]  Oh, no.
[30:56.800 --> 30:57.260]  Why does it sound so...
[30:57.260 --> 30:57.820]  What are these?
[30:57.940 --> 30:58.440]  Oh, no.
[30:58.540 --> 30:59.260]  It's the bad guy.
[30:59.400 --> 31:00.100]  It's the big boys.
[31:00.500 --> 31:01.880]  I think it's the main guys.
[31:02.380 --> 31:02.980]  So this is it.
[31:03.220 --> 31:04.520]  We're going to need to spin left or something.
[31:05.280 --> 31:06.340]  Yeah, we're spinning right.
[31:06.520 --> 31:06.840]  Sorry.
[31:07.980 --> 31:09.180]  We're just going to pick up this treasure.
[31:09.800 --> 31:10.240]  Get ready.
[31:10.360 --> 31:11.760]  They're going to unload on us in a moment.
[31:11.880 --> 31:12.020]  All right.
[31:12.020 --> 31:13.040]  I'm taking this down with me.
[31:13.280 --> 31:14.920]  Which fucking side do I need to be on?
[31:15.140 --> 31:15.680]  This side.
[31:15.740 --> 31:16.060]  This side.
[31:16.100 --> 31:16.840]  Side with me.
[31:17.040 --> 31:18.180]  Oh, fuck me.
[31:18.180 --> 31:18.540]  Can we hit?
[31:18.640 --> 31:19.320]  Can I straighten it out?
[31:19.720 --> 31:20.880]  Oh, we're hit.
[31:21.160 --> 31:23.060]  Dude, they're all just directly behind us.
[31:23.120 --> 31:24.060]  Nick, you're going to be so busy.
[31:24.060 --> 31:24.500]  I'm already busy, baby.
[31:24.520 --> 31:24.880]  Sorry, dude.
[31:26.020 --> 31:26.940]  I still can't get them.
[31:27.000 --> 31:27.620]  There's treasure up ahead.
[31:27.680 --> 31:28.400]  Still can't get them.
[31:28.480 --> 31:28.740]  Oh, fuck.
[31:28.860 --> 31:28.980]  They spot us.
[31:28.980 --> 31:29.100]  Oh, no.
[31:29.100 --> 31:29.860]  You're turning the wrong...
[31:29.860 --> 31:30.320]  Oh, no.
[31:30.400 --> 31:31.280]  The turn was bad.
[31:31.460 --> 31:31.720]  They spot us.
[31:32.760 --> 31:33.100]  All right.
[31:33.120 --> 31:34.840]  I'm going for the other guy on the other side.
[31:34.880 --> 31:35.500]  I hit him.
[31:37.000 --> 31:37.540]  Oh, no.
[31:37.840 --> 31:38.540]  Oh, fuck.
[31:39.840 --> 31:40.080]  Okay.
[31:40.200 --> 31:40.660]  I think I...
[31:40.660 --> 31:40.940]  I'm on fire.
[31:41.100 --> 31:41.940]  Nick, how's it going down there?
[31:42.000 --> 31:42.120]  Good.
[31:42.880 --> 31:44.480]  We got fire up here on the ship.
[31:44.480 --> 31:44.900]  Oh.
[31:45.060 --> 31:45.820]  I'm on fire.
[31:46.300 --> 31:46.920]  Oh, shit.
[31:47.480 --> 31:48.420]  How do I become...
[31:48.420 --> 31:49.640]  If you blow your barrel...
[31:49.640 --> 31:52.120]  Your bucket with water and hit left trigger...
[31:52.120 --> 31:52.280]  You got it.
[31:52.280 --> 31:53.780]  You'll throw it on yourself.
[31:56.880 --> 31:57.360]  All right.
[31:57.400 --> 31:58.700]  I'm just...
[32:01.280 --> 32:03.680]  Fucking taking these bitches to town.
[32:03.680 --> 32:04.860]  Dude, this is crazy.
[32:04.860 --> 32:05.500]  You're on the fire.
[32:07.260 --> 32:08.680]  Oh, okay.
[32:08.700 --> 32:09.000]  I got him.
[32:09.120 --> 32:09.520]  Touched him.
[32:09.620 --> 32:09.840]  Fuck.
[32:10.000 --> 32:10.360]  Come on.
[32:11.400 --> 32:13.280]  God, they're all just directly behind us.
[32:13.280 --> 32:13.960]  Coming up on the left.
[32:14.040 --> 32:14.720]  Coming up on the left.
[32:15.260 --> 32:16.060]  Coming up on the left.
[32:16.180 --> 32:16.560]  Hard left.
[32:16.680 --> 32:17.020]  Hard left.
[32:19.600 --> 32:20.180]  Hold shit.
[32:20.320 --> 32:22.180]  They're just hugging us from all sides.
[32:23.960 --> 32:25.180]  A ghost passed through us.
[32:25.600 --> 32:25.880]  Damn it.
[32:26.300 --> 32:27.640]  Couldn't get it loaded fast enough.
[32:28.420 --> 32:28.740]  Is that guy?
[32:28.920 --> 32:29.100]  All right.
[32:29.160 --> 32:29.580]  Get this guy.
[32:32.640 --> 32:33.100]  All right.
[32:33.200 --> 32:34.080]  We're holding in the basement.
[32:34.180 --> 32:34.520]  Nick, just call out if you need help.
[32:37.700 --> 32:38.180]  All right.
[32:38.280 --> 32:38.620]  All right.
[32:38.740 --> 32:39.760]  He's gone.
[32:40.060 --> 32:40.400]  Got him.
[32:41.460 --> 32:42.120]  I'm out of...
[32:42.120 --> 32:43.400]  I'm out of...
[32:43.400 --> 32:44.280]  Fuck, me too.
[32:45.220 --> 32:45.820]  All right.
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.200]  We got...
[32:49.200 --> 32:49.620]  Okay, killed one.
[32:49.620 --> 32:51.300]  Everything's on fire up at the top at the treasure.
[32:51.520 --> 32:52.000]  Got it.
[32:54.540 --> 32:54.980]  God.
[32:55.400 --> 32:55.880]  Hit him.
[32:56.360 --> 32:56.840]  Hell yeah.
[32:57.240 --> 32:57.520]  Oh.
[32:58.540 --> 32:59.680]  Great work, everyone.
[33:01.280 --> 33:02.460]  Okay, refilling the water barrel.
[33:02.600 --> 33:02.820]  Okay.
[33:03.100 --> 33:03.640]  I'm on fire.
[33:03.900 --> 33:04.500]  And you are too.
[33:05.640 --> 33:06.180]  All right.
[33:06.260 --> 33:07.040]  I'm gonna...
[33:07.040 --> 33:07.880]  I'm gonna waste the ammo.
[33:08.200 --> 33:09.100]  No, no, just wait.
[33:09.360 --> 33:10.440]  Okay, fire's starting to spread.
[33:10.840 --> 33:12.020]  Refill your ammo if you can.
[33:12.020 --> 33:13.360]  I'm gonna prioritize on fire for a moment.
[33:15.700 --> 33:16.820]  Oh, where is...
[33:16.820 --> 33:17.900]  There's water down here to scoop?
[33:18.540 --> 33:19.440]  I assume there's plenty.
[33:19.560 --> 33:20.180]  Yeah, it's in the bucket to the left.
[33:20.540 --> 33:20.680]  Okay.
[33:20.840 --> 33:21.740]  You gotta refill it, Nick.
[33:21.760 --> 33:22.280]  How do you do that?
[33:22.820 --> 33:23.200]  There you do it.
[33:23.220 --> 33:24.700]  Just right trigger when you're holding the lever.
[33:24.700 --> 33:24.960]  Oh, okay.
[33:26.040 --> 33:27.020]  Oh, right trigger.
[33:27.260 --> 33:27.920]  My bad.
[33:30.460 --> 33:30.980]  Right trigger.
[33:31.020 --> 33:31.160]  Got it.
[33:31.320 --> 33:31.600]  Yeah.
[33:33.380 --> 33:34.120]  Oh, I'm down.
[33:35.580 --> 33:36.580]  Okay, revive Nick.
[33:39.040 --> 33:39.680]  I'm on it.
[33:41.700 --> 33:42.720]  Sorry, it was on fire.
[33:43.460 --> 33:44.000]  That's okay.
[33:44.040 --> 33:46.080]  We just need everybody on fire duty for a moment.
[33:46.480 --> 33:46.780]  Yeah.
[33:49.640 --> 33:50.280]  We have...
[33:51.100 --> 33:54.260]  We have a leak in our boat now, so that makes the fire a lot easier to deal with.
[33:54.520 --> 33:54.820]  Got it.
[33:55.940 --> 33:57.200]  They're coming up on the left again.
[33:57.380 --> 33:57.880]  They're coming up.
[33:58.260 --> 33:58.580]  Geoff.
[33:58.880 --> 33:59.420]  Okay, I'm coming.
[33:59.540 --> 33:59.700]  I'm coming.
[33:59.800 --> 34:00.640]  Sorry, I was helping with the fire.
[34:01.880 --> 34:02.480]  Left, you said?
[34:03.120 --> 34:03.440]  Yeah.
[34:04.880 --> 34:05.340]  Come on.
[34:05.340 --> 34:06.060]  Fuck, it's not loaded.
[34:07.040 --> 34:07.360]  Cannibals.
[34:08.240 --> 34:08.880]  Oh, shit.
[34:08.880 --> 34:09.640]  It's loaded.
[34:11.200 --> 34:12.520]  This was not loaded either.
[34:12.640 --> 34:13.060]  God damn.
[34:16.940 --> 34:18.560]  Alright, he's done.
[34:19.420 --> 34:20.980]  I'm hitting the heavy one.
[34:23.180 --> 34:24.320]  Okay, I think...
[34:24.320 --> 34:25.160]  Oh, shit.
[34:26.000 --> 34:26.840]  God damn it.
[34:28.640 --> 34:29.740]  Oh, fuck.
[34:31.440 --> 34:32.540]  Nick, we're gonna need some...
[34:32.540 --> 34:33.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:34.100 --> 34:35.860]  We need some extreme repairs.
[34:38.300 --> 34:39.600]  You guys are on fire.
[34:39.780 --> 34:41.760]  Yeah, how do I use the bucket on myself?
[34:41.960 --> 34:42.240]  Left trigger.
[34:42.420 --> 34:43.060]  Hold left trigger.
[34:43.340 --> 34:43.640]  I'm down.
[34:43.820 --> 34:44.080]  Left trigger.
[34:44.260 --> 34:44.600]  I'm down.
[34:46.780 --> 34:47.980]  Okay, getting Eric.
[34:48.240 --> 34:48.720]  Thank you.
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.660]  Okay, I think...
[34:50.660 --> 34:51.380]  We got a scoop.
[34:51.460 --> 34:52.200]  We got a bucket, guys.
[34:52.560 --> 34:53.020]  Yeah, I hear you.
[34:53.640 --> 34:56.320]  I think I've got all the holes done, though.
[34:56.640 --> 34:57.420]  Oh, nope, there's one more.
[34:57.500 --> 34:57.600]  Okay, good job.
[34:58.220 --> 34:58.580]  One more.
[35:00.180 --> 35:01.500]  A lot of fire upstairs.
[35:02.040 --> 35:03.280]  A lot of water downstairs.
[35:03.700 --> 35:04.420]  Refilling water.
[35:04.620 --> 35:05.760]  Well, good news is one can be used for the other.
[35:06.160 --> 35:06.800]  Don't use...
[35:06.800 --> 35:08.080]  Don't need to use the water bucket right now.
[35:08.120 --> 35:09.040]  You can use the bottom floor.
[35:12.760 --> 35:14.480]  Fuck me, this fire sucks.
[35:14.760 --> 35:15.480]  It really does.
[35:18.060 --> 35:19.380]  Alright, thank you for getting that emptied.
[35:19.600 --> 35:20.920]  Who knew fire spreads?
[35:21.120 --> 35:21.560]  Good lord.
[35:22.420 --> 35:23.180]  No one told me.
[35:23.960 --> 35:25.560]  Alright, the guy's way over there.
[35:26.180 --> 35:26.400]  Yeah.
[35:26.720 --> 35:28.120]  Oh, wow, we're really close to land, huh?
[35:29.180 --> 35:29.540]  Yeah.
[35:30.500 --> 35:32.260]  If I hit that bitch, that'd be so cool.
[35:32.400 --> 35:32.760]  I did not.
[35:32.860 --> 35:33.400]  I was close, though.
[35:35.760 --> 35:36.440]  I'm down again.
[35:36.560 --> 35:37.920]  I hit left bumper.
[35:38.280 --> 35:40.120]  I don't know what I was supposed to do.
[35:40.280 --> 35:40.860]  I had water.
[35:41.180 --> 35:42.240]  Oh, left trigger.
[35:43.180 --> 35:43.580]  Okay.
[35:43.960 --> 35:45.800]  There's still water in the bottom of the boat, guys.
[35:46.120 --> 35:46.760]  Just FYI.
[35:46.900 --> 35:47.960]  And the guy's coming up on the right.
[35:49.080 --> 35:50.220]  There's water in the bottom still?
[35:50.440 --> 35:51.160]  I'm firing on him.
[35:51.820 --> 35:52.340]  Okay, I'm coming.
[35:53.840 --> 35:54.760]  Oh, you're on fire.
[35:56.580 --> 35:57.520]  I'm not loaded.
[36:02.180 --> 36:03.280]  Can't get him anymore.
[36:03.440 --> 36:04.000]  Don't forget to eat.
[36:04.280 --> 36:04.680]  Shit.
[36:05.420 --> 36:07.980]  Yeah, make sure you eat and then...
[36:07.980 --> 36:08.480]  I got this fire.
[36:10.520 --> 36:13.160]  Okay, I got a repair happening on the hull.
[36:13.880 --> 36:14.980]  Sounds like another one.
[36:15.760 --> 36:16.860]  Oh, guy's coming up on the left.
[36:17.540 --> 36:18.080]  Oh, shit.
[36:18.520 --> 36:18.980]  He hit me.
[36:19.340 --> 36:20.800]  Coming right up hard on the left.
[36:21.180 --> 36:21.720]  Yeah, I see it.
[36:22.620 --> 36:23.480]  I'm not going to be able to get to him.
[36:23.480 --> 36:24.760]  I don't know if we're going to be able to get the angle.
[36:25.920 --> 36:26.640]  Keeps coming around.
[36:26.800 --> 36:27.040]  We can.
[36:27.220 --> 36:27.640]  Alright, we're...
[36:27.640 --> 36:28.060]  Got that one.
[36:29.380 --> 36:29.740]  There.
[36:31.820 --> 36:32.820]  Got that one.
[36:34.700 --> 36:35.500]  Okay, I think...
[36:35.500 --> 36:37.460]  Just a moment without fire would be so nice.
[36:37.460 --> 36:39.100]  That should be it for him.
[36:39.680 --> 36:40.740]  Come on, troll.
[36:41.880 --> 36:43.140]  That guy takes a lot of health.
[36:43.320 --> 36:43.920]  A lot of hits.
[36:44.060 --> 36:44.400]  Yeah, he's...
[36:44.400 --> 36:44.960]  There's fire somewhere.
[36:45.100 --> 36:45.260]  He's heavy.
[36:45.740 --> 36:46.580]  He's the boss, man.
[36:49.620 --> 36:50.420]  Did we just get him?
[36:50.560 --> 36:51.120]  We just got him.
[36:51.540 --> 36:52.020]  Fuck yeah.
[36:52.180 --> 36:52.420]  Nice.
[36:52.560 --> 36:52.740]  Okay, cool.
[36:57.800 --> 36:58.240]  Look at that.
[36:58.760 --> 36:59.820]  Treasure to the right.
[37:01.280 --> 37:02.800]  I'm working to put on this fire.
[37:03.260 --> 37:03.520]  Yep.
[37:04.060 --> 37:04.680]  Ah, I'm on fire.
[37:04.880 --> 37:05.580]  Ah, I'm on fire.
[37:05.980 --> 37:06.000]  I'm on fire.
[37:07.100 --> 37:08.120]  I'm about to go down again.
[37:09.560 --> 37:10.540]  Oh no, I'm going to go down.
[37:10.660 --> 37:11.040]  Thank you.
[37:11.120 --> 37:11.420]  I'm down.
[37:12.020 --> 37:12.360]  I'm down.
[37:13.340 --> 37:14.060]  Okay, revivings.
[37:18.630 --> 37:19.310]  Eric's back.
[37:21.790 --> 37:22.630]  Chef, getting you.
[37:23.170 --> 37:23.470]  Thank you.
[37:24.570 --> 37:25.290]  Eating food.
[37:25.630 --> 37:25.890]  Eating food.
[37:25.890 --> 37:26.650]  Still have fire burning.
[37:27.810 --> 37:28.070]  Where?
[37:28.270 --> 37:28.590]  Upstairs?
[37:29.510 --> 37:29.870]  Yes.
[37:29.950 --> 37:30.470]  Oh, oh yeah.
[37:30.670 --> 37:31.610]  Never put the fire out.
[37:31.850 --> 37:33.750]  No, I've been trying to put the fire out.
[37:33.810 --> 37:34.170]  So have I.
[37:34.210 --> 37:36.230]  I've been working on it for like five minutes.
[37:36.250 --> 37:36.830]  Alright, I think I got that.
[37:37.610 --> 37:38.590]  It's on top now.
[37:40.690 --> 37:41.910]  Okay, there's one more piece.
[37:42.350 --> 37:45.190]  I was trying to throw my water barrel and somebody walked right in front of me.
[37:45.210 --> 37:45.630]  I hate it.
[37:49.630 --> 37:51.550]  Got it, got it, got it.
[37:52.950 --> 37:53.510]  Fire's out.
[37:54.950 --> 37:55.310]  Okay.
[37:56.070 --> 37:56.630]  The treasure?
[37:57.570 --> 37:59.990]  Yeah, we passed him turning around for us to look at.
[38:00.010 --> 38:01.670]  Where the hell is this water coming from in the fucking basement?
[38:01.670 --> 38:04.390]  Nick, if you could start repairing again, that'd be awesome.
[38:04.590 --> 38:05.690]  Yeah, second level repairs?
[38:06.690 --> 38:07.050]  Yes.
[38:07.130 --> 38:07.290]  Okay.
[38:07.790 --> 38:08.730]  Where's the wood?
[38:08.730 --> 38:10.630]  So there's a wood barrel.
[38:10.970 --> 38:14.350]  Supply, go to the supply crate by the anchor and get wood from there.
[38:14.390 --> 38:15.090]  Yeah, got it.
[38:17.170 --> 38:18.190]  Oh my god.
[38:20.710 --> 38:21.950]  That was insane.
[38:23.510 --> 38:24.230]  Goodness gracious.
[38:24.690 --> 38:25.410]  Are there no more holes?
[38:25.650 --> 38:26.010]  You're almost lined up.
[38:26.170 --> 38:27.530]  No, there's a lot of holes on the second floor here.
[38:28.190 --> 38:28.770]  Oh, got it.
[38:30.910 --> 38:33.190]  I'm not really sure how to refer to it in the shit, but whatever.
[38:34.710 --> 38:35.850]  Second level, that makes sense.
[38:35.970 --> 38:36.830]  Not the bottom, middle.
[38:38.190 --> 38:38.830]  Okay, straight.
[38:41.070 --> 38:43.810]  Me and Nick are repairing all these holes. You guys just do...
[38:43.810 --> 38:44.910]  Yeah, I'm getting loot.
[38:45.230 --> 38:45.810]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:45.990 --> 38:46.490]  I'm helping repair.
[38:49.550 --> 38:51.970]  Andrew, do you need a hand with the treasure or anything up there? You got it.
[38:53.230 --> 38:53.990]  I think I'm good.
[38:54.150 --> 38:54.670]  I can come help.
[38:55.270 --> 38:56.610]  Looks like we got a ghost ship on the way.
[38:56.710 --> 38:58.610]  Can you tilt the boat a little bit to the left, Geoff?
[38:59.250 --> 39:01.750]  Uh, yeah. Is that a ghost ship in front of us? Is that a problem?
[39:02.150 --> 39:02.290]  Yeah.
[39:02.610 --> 39:03.990]  I think we got all the holes.
[39:03.990 --> 39:07.910]  Oh, shit. There's definitely water in the basement, though, Eric. We gotta scoop this quick.
[39:09.150 --> 39:09.990]  Uh, okay.
[39:10.710 --> 39:12.270]  I'm gonna come help with the water.
[39:12.310 --> 39:12.490]  Thank you.
[39:13.010 --> 39:13.290]  Yeah.
[39:14.630 --> 39:15.510]  I'm gonna go patch the holes.
[39:15.510 --> 39:16.850]  Oh my god, there's a lot of water.
[39:16.850 --> 39:18.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go patch wherever it is.
[39:18.530 --> 39:19.210]  Got all the treasure.
[39:21.930 --> 39:23.170]  Where the fuck... where is it?
[39:23.510 --> 39:24.170]  Oh, there it is.
[39:27.110 --> 39:28.010]  Tilting us right.
[39:28.070 --> 39:30.250]  Alright, that should slow it.
[39:31.030 --> 39:32.730]  I earned a milestone in buckets.
[39:33.290 --> 39:35.270]  Do I have to, like, take the water somewhere?
[39:35.430 --> 39:36.550]  You have to take it up off the top.
[39:37.110 --> 39:38.750]  Yeah, take it up top and throw it off the side of the boat.
[39:38.750 --> 39:40.390]  You scoop it and you throw it over the side.
[39:41.430 --> 39:42.730]  I think we only got one boat left.
[39:43.330 --> 39:43.650]  Cool.
[39:44.310 --> 39:45.610]  Where was that fucking hole?
[39:46.610 --> 39:46.890]  I don't know.
[39:47.550 --> 39:48.670]  There were two of them down here.
[39:49.310 --> 39:50.750]  Okay, I'm not seeing any now.
[39:50.890 --> 39:54.750]  I don't see a ghost ship. Uh, oh, ghost ship over to the left.
[39:55.230 --> 39:56.190]  Yeah, I just see something.
[39:56.190 --> 39:57.690]  But he's really far and there's a...
[39:57.690 --> 39:58.210]  Is there a treasure in the water?
[39:58.310 --> 40:00.450]  There's a bunch of treasure. You wanna take us over to that treasure?
[40:01.210 --> 40:01.370]  Yeah.
[40:02.690 --> 40:04.330]  Is it to the left? Is that what you're referring to?
[40:04.330 --> 40:05.270]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, to the left.
[40:06.550 --> 40:08.170]  It's like where the flying things are, right?
[40:08.430 --> 40:09.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:09.750 --> 40:10.750]  Yeah, that's it.
[40:11.410 --> 40:14.310]  Okay, pretty close. If we can get a little bit closer.
[40:14.850 --> 40:16.890]  If you head on straight from here, you should be good.
[40:19.090 --> 40:20.690]  You're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing great.
[40:20.750 --> 40:23.310]  If someone wants to jump on the right, maybe, just in case.
[40:23.790 --> 40:24.090]  Sure.
[40:24.370 --> 40:26.510]  Come on. Yeah, yeah, someone get on the right treasure thing.
[40:26.670 --> 40:27.510]  Or the right harpoon.
[40:27.750 --> 40:28.330]  Alright, I'm on it.
[40:28.750 --> 40:31.330]  Yeah, yeah, grab it, because it's coming to your side. It's coming to your side.
[40:32.030 --> 40:32.650]  It's right there. You see it?
[40:33.070 --> 40:33.210]  Yep.
[40:33.590 --> 40:34.330]  Yeah, you got it. Good work.
[40:35.630 --> 40:35.990]  Nice.
[40:35.990 --> 40:36.670]  Hell yeah.
[40:36.830 --> 40:37.630]  Nice. Good work, boys.
[40:38.670 --> 40:39.330]  Good shooting.
[40:40.210 --> 40:41.270]  Wow, look at this.
[40:41.790 --> 40:44.510]  Now let's focus in on this last ship. Let's get this fucker.
[40:44.810 --> 40:45.890]  Hell yeah.
[40:46.270 --> 40:48.490]  We're repaired. Everyone have food? Everyone's good on that?
[40:48.810 --> 40:49.530]  Yep, all good.
[40:50.090 --> 40:52.850]  Cool. Get cannonballs. Make sure you're supplied on cannonballs.
[40:53.250 --> 40:53.910]  Oh, good call.
[40:55.510 --> 40:55.850]  Okay.
[40:56.070 --> 40:56.970]  Lowering sails.
[40:56.970 --> 40:57.750]  Okay.
[40:58.150 --> 41:00.210]  This bitch right here, we're coming for you.
[41:00.390 --> 41:01.390]  He is dead ahead.
[41:01.630 --> 41:02.590]  He's trying to hide from us.
[41:02.810 --> 41:05.230]  Oh, he's on the other side of the island. He's trying to get away, I think.
[41:06.170 --> 41:07.310]  He's a little hidey bitch.
[41:07.590 --> 41:09.550]  That's okay. That's okay. We know where you're going.
[41:09.890 --> 41:10.770]  We're on to you.
[41:11.550 --> 41:13.010]  This is the first time I've seen light.
[41:14.750 --> 41:15.910]  Outside of the bottom of the ship.
[41:16.130 --> 41:17.710]  Yeah, it's been pretty busy down there.
[41:18.470 --> 41:21.450]  Oh, he's, uh, he, if you keep going this way, we're gonna run right, yeah.
[41:21.470 --> 41:22.310]  There he is.
[41:23.010 --> 41:23.250]  Yeah.
[41:23.250 --> 41:27.250]  Don't worry, Nick, you've officially earned your maritime stripes after today.
[41:27.370 --> 41:27.770]  Yay!
[41:29.230 --> 41:30.510]  All right, lining up on him.
[41:30.870 --> 41:31.570]  Here we go.
[41:33.070 --> 41:34.430]  Okay, he is coming.
[41:35.710 --> 41:36.490]  Yeah, this is good.
[41:36.770 --> 41:38.410]  We're gonna intersect his loser ass.
[41:38.570 --> 41:39.070]  Yeah, definitely.
[41:40.450 --> 41:41.750]  Get ready to die.
[41:42.930 --> 41:44.030]  Oh, get ready to undie.
[41:44.050 --> 41:46.770]  Make sure we're all loaded up on cannonballs, because he might come over to the right.
[41:46.930 --> 41:47.650]  Yeah, great call.
[41:47.790 --> 41:48.850]  I think they're all full.
[41:48.890 --> 41:49.670]  Looks like we're all loaded.
[41:51.210 --> 41:51.530]  Okay.
[41:51.570 --> 41:52.430]  We're coming up on him.
[41:52.450 --> 41:53.390]  He's, he's coming up.
[41:53.450 --> 41:54.890]  If you adjust a little bit left...
[41:55.410 --> 41:55.910]  Oh, fuck.
[41:55.990 --> 41:56.570]  This is gonna be tough.
[41:57.070 --> 41:58.090]  No, we got this motherfucker.
[41:58.090 --> 41:59.070]  Just get ready to line up.
[41:59.130 --> 42:00.310]  Everybody just get on the cannon.
[42:00.490 --> 42:02.090]  It's gonna take everything we have.
[42:02.350 --> 42:03.530]  Oh, here we go.
[42:03.790 --> 42:05.770]  I'm afraid he's gonna head over to the right really fast.
[42:05.770 --> 42:06.170]  Here we go.
[42:06.550 --> 42:07.370]  All right, boys, you ready?
[42:08.010 --> 42:08.210]  All right.
[42:08.590 --> 42:09.110]  Cannon's away.
[42:09.190 --> 42:09.330]  Boom!
[42:12.390 --> 42:13.070]  Well, that was it.
[42:13.270 --> 42:13.870]  That's all I could do.
[42:14.990 --> 42:15.430]  One boom.
[42:15.550 --> 42:15.850]  Okay, spinning left.
[42:16.930 --> 42:17.690]  Okay, he's on the left side.
[42:17.710 --> 42:18.290]  He's on the left side.
[42:18.290 --> 42:19.230]  He's behind us.
[42:19.330 --> 42:20.510]  Can't get to him, can't get to him.
[42:20.590 --> 42:21.350]  Getting some shots.
[42:23.350 --> 42:24.610]  All right, we're still good here.
[42:25.170 --> 42:26.250]  Yeah, boat looks good down below.
[42:26.830 --> 42:28.870]  We got like five or six hits into him.
[42:28.910 --> 42:29.270]  That's great.
[42:29.310 --> 42:29.870]  Yeah, that was great.
[42:30.110 --> 42:30.890]  Gotta be pretty weak.
[42:33.830 --> 42:34.970]  I like the Hail Mary.
[42:35.170 --> 42:36.130]  I don't, I don't mind that.
[42:36.290 --> 42:37.870]  That's, that's how we took out the last ones.
[42:38.210 --> 42:38.730]  We'll get those motherfuckers.
[42:38.730 --> 42:39.410]  Oh, look at those two.
[42:39.630 --> 42:40.250]  Those two are...
[42:40.250 --> 42:41.550]  It was just me and Geoff shooting deep.
[42:41.930 --> 42:44.210]  Just gotta get, gotta get it locked in.
[42:44.690 --> 42:45.010]  Yep.
[42:47.250 --> 42:50.570]  Because once you hit him once, you kind of know where he's at.
[42:50.890 --> 42:52.410]  Nah, all right, let's hold it, let's hold up.
[42:52.810 --> 42:53.350]  Little bitch.
[42:53.390 --> 42:53.510]  Yep.
[42:53.910 --> 42:55.210]  All right, load up on, uh...
[42:55.210 --> 42:55.430]  Yeah.
[42:56.110 --> 42:57.710]  Load up on cannonballs and everything.
[42:57.890 --> 42:58.490]  Let me check everything.
[42:59.530 --> 43:01.090]  Yeah, make sure, make sure we're clean.
[43:01.250 --> 43:01.730]  We're clean.
[43:02.450 --> 43:02.710]  Okay.
[43:03.150 --> 43:06.510]  Any of these have cannonballs in them, please?
[43:06.930 --> 43:09.870]  He's on our left still, but the way we're going, we're good.
[43:10.690 --> 43:11.150]  Yeah, we're good.
[43:12.010 --> 43:13.270]  Okay, I got five at least.
[43:13.370 --> 43:14.430]  I don't see any more treasure.
[43:15.570 --> 43:17.730]  Yeah, I'm at seven cannonballs, so we should be okay.
[43:17.850 --> 43:19.970]  About to see a bunch and kill this prick.
[43:20.550 --> 43:20.810]  Yeah.
[43:21.550 --> 43:22.210]  All right.
[43:22.530 --> 43:23.630]  Is he trying to run from us?
[43:23.890 --> 43:25.210]  I think he's trying to flee.
[43:25.570 --> 43:25.950]  No.
[43:26.390 --> 43:26.710]  I think so.
[43:26.950 --> 43:31.930]  I think, I think he's just trying, I think he's trying to keep distance and then come straight on.
[43:32.530 --> 43:33.550]  That's not going to happen.
[43:34.070 --> 43:35.390]  All right, I'm going to snipe him.
[43:36.010 --> 43:36.810]  Coming up on him.
[43:37.950 --> 43:38.330]  Hey.
[43:40.210 --> 43:40.590]  Hey.
[43:42.410 --> 43:43.710]  Geoff's just shooting him with bullets.
[43:43.710 --> 43:46.510]  You know what, Geoff?
[43:47.930 --> 43:48.370]  Yeehaw.
[43:48.650 --> 43:50.070]  Never, never stop attacking.
[43:51.590 --> 43:53.110]  With everything you've got.
[43:54.470 --> 43:56.270]  This is what I learned in the army, boys.
[43:56.930 --> 43:57.430]  Hell yeah.
[43:57.970 --> 43:59.370]  Did I get close that time?
[44:01.690 --> 44:03.290]  He's got a pretty hard drop off.
[44:03.930 --> 44:04.930]  Yeah, but if you aim high enough.
[44:06.290 --> 44:10.650]  Okay, so we're going dead ahead to him still. We're chasing him down.
[44:11.250 --> 44:11.510]  Yep.
[44:12.950 --> 44:16.030]  Should we open the sails to get more speed to gain on him, or do you think we're okay?
[44:16.430 --> 44:17.790]  Yeah, yeah, that could work.
[44:18.390 --> 44:20.630]  I mean, we are catching up to him pretty good.
[44:22.370 --> 44:23.770]  He's getting pretty close.
[44:24.490 --> 44:26.790]  Cut inward also to get the angle on him a little bit.
[44:26.790 --> 44:27.270]  Yeah, absolutely.
[44:29.710 --> 44:34.070]  Like when there's barrels in the water, like there's just some barrels that are just nothing.
[44:34.170 --> 44:35.690]  There could be food in that.
[44:35.930 --> 44:38.890]  Oh, okay, so if there's anything in the water, just grab it.
[44:38.970 --> 44:39.370]  Absolutely.
[44:39.970 --> 44:41.390]  If you can harpoon it, yeah.
[44:41.390 --> 44:44.550]  Got it, got it. Good to know. Did not know that.
[44:45.010 --> 44:48.170]  Okay, so you're going to want to cut a little bit more inward.
[44:48.870 --> 44:48.990]  Yep.
[44:50.370 --> 44:53.870]  Just on the other side of this island.
[44:54.810 --> 44:56.650]  Can you imagine if Call of Duty worked this well?
[44:56.890 --> 44:58.550]  Oh shit, he's firing on us.
[45:01.030 --> 45:02.490]  Oh, going back down.
[45:05.470 --> 45:07.490]  Alright, looks like he's making a turn also.
[45:10.030 --> 45:12.110]  You want to straighten out from here? Might be okay?
[45:12.310 --> 45:12.730]  Yeah, I am.
[45:12.850 --> 45:15.490]  I just don't want to hit that island.
[45:15.750 --> 45:16.470]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:16.470 --> 45:17.050]  You're doing great.
[45:17.670 --> 45:18.990]  We're going to level up on him.
[45:19.470 --> 45:20.690]  Or get level with him.
[45:20.790 --> 45:21.810]  He's going to be on the right, right?
[45:22.350 --> 45:23.530]  Yeah, he'll be on the right.
[45:23.790 --> 45:24.330]  Should be.
[45:24.750 --> 45:25.770]  Alright, he's hit us a few times.
[45:25.770 --> 45:26.690]  Oh fuck, he's hitting us more.
[45:26.770 --> 45:27.270]  I think he's going to...
[45:27.270 --> 45:27.430]  Yeah.
[45:27.850 --> 45:28.770]  Oh, fuck me.
[45:30.010 --> 45:31.270]  Okay, taking left.
[45:31.810 --> 45:32.070]  Yep.
[45:32.070 --> 45:33.150]  About to be in firing position.
[45:34.290 --> 45:35.670]  Oh boy, come on around.
[45:35.790 --> 45:36.010]  Come on.
[45:36.010 --> 45:36.790]  Come on, you little dickhead.
[45:37.570 --> 45:41.590]  I got a cannonball with your dead ass name on it.
[45:41.650 --> 45:41.770]  Oh my god.
[45:41.770 --> 45:42.430]  Keep going, Andrew.
[45:42.510 --> 45:43.270]  You're doing great, you're doing great.
[45:43.450 --> 45:43.950]  Yep, yep, yep.
[45:44.510 --> 45:45.830]  Make sure you're loaded, locked and ready.
[45:45.870 --> 45:46.250]  Here we go.
[45:46.550 --> 45:47.410]  Locked and loaded.
[45:47.610 --> 45:48.310]  Ready, Freddy.
[45:48.310 --> 45:48.670]  Here we go.
[45:48.770 --> 45:51.390]  I'm going to shove it right up his asshole.
[45:51.790 --> 45:52.330]  Blast him.
[45:52.390 --> 45:52.870]  In the window.
[45:55.250 --> 45:55.870]  Blast him.
[45:57.630 --> 45:58.530]  Hitting him hard.
[45:59.350 --> 46:00.210]  Hitting him fast.
[46:01.070 --> 46:01.590]  Joining you.
[46:01.610 --> 46:01.910]  Got him.
[46:02.310 --> 46:03.050]  Hell yeah!
[46:03.610 --> 46:04.430]  Good job, boys.
[46:04.670 --> 46:04.850]  Yes!
[46:04.850 --> 46:06.050]  And then one to go on.
[46:06.490 --> 46:06.630]  Alright.
[46:07.030 --> 46:07.090]  Yeah!
[46:07.970 --> 46:09.290]  There's our loot right there.
[46:09.330 --> 46:09.870]  We've done it!
[46:10.050 --> 46:11.310]  Yeah, it went back the other way.
[46:11.490 --> 46:12.790]  Okay, let's raise sails.
[46:13.150 --> 46:13.330]  Yep.
[46:13.670 --> 46:14.410]  For sharper turning.
[46:14.890 --> 46:15.290]  Wow.
[46:15.770 --> 46:16.170]  Perfect.
[46:16.730 --> 46:16.950]  Cool.
[46:17.790 --> 46:18.930]  Great job, guys.
[46:18.970 --> 46:19.510]  A great victory.
[46:20.310 --> 46:21.850]  You know, nobody fell in the water either.
[46:22.750 --> 46:23.430]  No, that was impressive.
[46:23.430 --> 46:24.370]  Hey, that's pretty impressive.
[46:24.570 --> 46:25.950]  Nick, you did a great fucking job.
[46:26.030 --> 46:27.170]  Nick MVP on that thing.
[46:27.210 --> 46:27.870]  Oh, absolutely.
[46:28.050 --> 46:28.450]  Absolutely.
[46:28.450 --> 46:30.710]  Nick tore it up down below.
[46:30.710 --> 46:31.830]  That was insane.
[46:32.670 --> 46:33.070]  Unbelievable.
[46:33.550 --> 46:34.170]  You know what, guys?
[46:34.170 --> 46:35.790]  I think we should rename it.
[46:35.950 --> 46:38.730]  It should no longer be called MVP from this point forward.
[46:38.810 --> 46:39.570]  It should be called MVP.
[46:40.370 --> 46:40.730]  Yeah!
[46:41.350 --> 46:42.070]  Oh, wow.
[46:42.430 --> 46:42.790]  Yeah!
[46:42.790 --> 46:43.350]  The MVP.
[46:43.550 --> 46:44.030]  I like it.
[46:44.570 --> 46:44.830]  Yeah.
[46:45.550 --> 46:46.810]  Nick, you just tore that up, man.
[46:46.830 --> 46:47.390]  That was crazy.
[46:47.730 --> 46:49.130]  That was nuts all around.
[46:49.530 --> 46:50.130]  Well done, fellas.
[46:50.310 --> 46:52.390]  I don't know how you did that, man, but you did it.
[46:52.510 --> 46:55.510]  Well, it helped that Andrew and Geoff would pop down periodically to be like,
[46:55.590 --> 46:56.330]  there's water in here.
[46:56.870 --> 46:58.350]  Head a little...
[46:58.350 --> 46:58.910]  Yeah, you got it.
[46:58.910 --> 46:59.210]  You got it.
[46:59.210 --> 46:59.510]  You got it.
[46:59.510 --> 46:59.850]  You got it.
[47:00.270 --> 47:00.350]  Yeah.
[47:02.410 --> 47:03.030]  That way.
[47:03.610 --> 47:04.130]  Geoff's eager.
[47:04.370 --> 47:04.510]  That way.
[47:04.670 --> 47:05.670]  I'm trying to get a seagull.
[47:07.270 --> 47:08.710]  I'm trying to get that same fucking bird.
[47:08.870 --> 47:09.270]  Come here.
[47:11.710 --> 47:12.390]  I want to get one.
[47:12.430 --> 47:13.370]  I want to spear a ghost.
[47:16.230 --> 47:17.290]  So what is...
[47:17.290 --> 47:20.790]  Andrew, out to like the left, there's like a violet kind of swirly thing.
[47:20.870 --> 47:21.350]  What is that?
[47:21.610 --> 47:22.310]  It's a different...
[47:22.310 --> 47:25.230]  That is like an underwater event thing you can do.
[47:25.230 --> 47:25.630]  Oh, okay.
[47:25.770 --> 47:26.390]  Just go over there.
[47:26.470 --> 47:27.170]  You can swim down.
[47:27.570 --> 47:28.190]  No, thanks.
[47:28.450 --> 47:29.410]  I'm fine on the boat.
[47:30.610 --> 47:31.110]  All right, Geoff.
[47:31.110 --> 47:31.430]  You got him?
[47:32.230 --> 47:32.550]  Yeah.
[47:32.570 --> 47:34.070]  Look at all that treasure.
[47:36.210 --> 47:36.530]  Almost.
[47:37.010 --> 47:37.610]  You got it.
[47:38.450 --> 47:39.110]  Here it comes.
[47:39.270 --> 47:39.670]  You got it.
[47:39.730 --> 47:40.270]  Here it comes.
[47:40.550 --> 47:41.390]  And you got it.
[47:41.450 --> 47:41.830]  Here it comes.
[47:41.850 --> 47:43.010]  Yeah, these guys are hard to get.
[47:43.750 --> 47:43.970]  Almost.
[47:44.690 --> 47:44.950]  Almost.
[47:44.950 --> 47:45.430]  There you go.
[47:45.490 --> 47:45.970]  There you go.
[47:45.970 --> 47:46.250]  All right.
[47:46.250 --> 47:47.030]  You're locked on, baby.
[47:47.250 --> 47:47.470]  Nope.
[47:47.530 --> 47:47.830]  Almost.
[47:48.090 --> 47:48.690]  Here we go.
[47:48.770 --> 47:49.190]  There they are.
[47:49.250 --> 47:49.550]  All right, Geoff.
[47:49.570 --> 47:49.950]  You got it.
[47:49.950 --> 47:50.550]  There you go.
[47:50.690 --> 47:51.150]  There's another.
[47:51.430 --> 47:52.090]  You got another one.
[47:52.250 --> 47:52.730]  Oh, you got it.
[47:52.730 --> 47:53.830]  You're locked on right here, baby.
[47:54.090 --> 47:54.290]  Nope.
[47:54.390 --> 47:54.750]  Too low.
[47:54.970 --> 47:55.290]  Almost.
[47:55.590 --> 47:55.690]  Loads of skulls.
[47:55.690 --> 47:56.230]  Gotta get them.
[47:57.050 --> 47:57.510]  There you go.
[47:58.290 --> 47:59.030]  There you go.
[47:59.610 --> 48:00.730]  Locked on, baby.
[48:00.870 --> 48:01.110]  There you...
[48:01.110 --> 48:01.370]  Yeah.
[48:01.590 --> 48:02.250]  Look at you.
[48:02.330 --> 48:02.630]  One more.
[48:02.690 --> 48:02.990]  One more.
[48:03.290 --> 48:03.670]  Yeah.
[48:04.090 --> 48:04.890]  Geoff got it all.
[48:05.970 --> 48:07.070]  Where does it all go?
[48:07.390 --> 48:08.010]  We take it to town.
[48:08.030 --> 48:08.890]  So we gotta...
[48:08.890 --> 48:10.370]  Yeah, we gotta cash it out.
[48:11.190 --> 48:11.810]  That is so much.
[48:11.810 --> 48:12.210]  So we just...
[48:12.210 --> 48:13.990]  I've never seen so much loot in my life.
[48:15.550 --> 48:15.950]  It's crazy.
[48:15.950 --> 48:16.290]  We have two choices.
[48:16.530 --> 48:22.490]  We can go directly to a port to cash out or we can stop at this fortress and get some
[48:22.490 --> 48:24.070]  more loot and then head to the port.
[48:26.050 --> 48:28.330]  I'm down with getting more loot, I guess.
[48:28.510 --> 48:28.930]  The fortress right here?
[48:28.930 --> 48:29.370]  How long is it?
[48:29.990 --> 48:30.770]  To the right.
[48:31.090 --> 48:31.710]  See that...
[48:31.710 --> 48:34.350]  The thing that was shooting cannonballs at us when we were coming across?
[48:34.830 --> 48:35.990]  We could go do that real quick.
[48:36.430 --> 48:36.790]  Is that...
[48:36.790 --> 48:37.150]  Oh, jeez.
[48:37.190 --> 48:37.710]  Will we die?
[48:39.750 --> 48:40.150]  Probably.
[48:40.350 --> 48:40.530]  Okay.
[48:40.530 --> 48:41.430]  But, like, we'll be fine.
[48:41.590 --> 48:42.530]  We'll respawn on the boat.
[48:43.830 --> 48:44.170]  Okay.
[48:44.510 --> 48:44.910]  All right.
[48:44.970 --> 48:45.990]  We just gotta fight some phantoms.
[48:46.410 --> 48:47.210]  Yeah, let's do it, I guess.
[48:47.230 --> 48:47.870]  So let's lower sails.
[48:47.970 --> 48:50.390]  Let's go to that green lit castle.
[48:50.610 --> 48:52.150]  Is that swords or guns with phantoms?
[48:52.150 --> 48:53.370]  It's gonna be...
[48:53.370 --> 48:54.770]  You can do either.
[48:55.210 --> 48:56.590]  Sword's probably preferable.
[48:57.450 --> 48:58.490]  Okay, get ready.
[49:00.610 --> 49:01.750]  We're gonna come in a little hot.
[49:04.390 --> 49:05.290]  What are we doing?
[49:05.870 --> 49:07.730]  We're gonna drop anchor in a minute.
[49:09.030 --> 49:09.590]  Okay.
[49:09.950 --> 49:11.730]  Hit drop anchor right now, Eric, please.
[49:12.310 --> 49:12.990]  Lower anchor?
[49:13.310 --> 49:13.810]  Lower anchor.
[49:14.090 --> 49:14.770]  I jumped!
[49:15.030 --> 49:15.490]  I missed.
[49:17.130 --> 49:17.890]  Anchor's lowered?
[49:18.530 --> 49:19.030]  Awesome.
[49:19.270 --> 49:19.810]  Thank you.
[49:21.170 --> 49:21.950]  Okay, if you guys...
[49:21.950 --> 49:25.130]  I just wanna hop over to that island and start fighting phantoms and shit.
[49:25.530 --> 49:26.250]  I walk the plank.
[49:28.150 --> 49:29.510]  I'll get the boat prepped.
[49:29.630 --> 49:32.050]  Do I need a gun or do I need a sword?
[49:32.050 --> 49:32.670]  Do you have a sword?
[49:33.150 --> 49:33.670]  I don't know.
[49:34.010 --> 49:34.730]  Yeah, I think you have both.
[49:34.990 --> 49:35.010]  Push Y?
[49:35.510 --> 49:36.910]  Just feels like a thing I would have.
[49:37.030 --> 49:37.770]  I do have a sword.
[49:39.730 --> 49:40.530]  Start swinging.
[49:40.670 --> 49:41.070]  Whoa!
[49:41.290 --> 49:42.270]  There's a macaw?
[49:42.870 --> 49:43.690]  I want the bird.
[49:43.890 --> 49:45.690]  I released my macaw into the boat earlier.
[49:45.690 --> 49:46.670]  Oh, that's sick.
[49:46.790 --> 49:47.510]  Oh, there's dudes.
[49:50.770 --> 49:51.170]  Okay.
[49:52.430 --> 49:53.750]  They're definitely dead.
[49:55.810 --> 49:57.670]  Is the combat pretty quick or pretty slow?
[49:58.950 --> 50:00.070]  Pretty quick-ish.
[50:00.410 --> 50:01.050]  Yeah, quick-ish.
[50:04.010 --> 50:04.450]  Okay.
[50:04.810 --> 50:05.630]  Gonna be fucking them up pretty easily.
[50:06.150 --> 50:06.370]  Yep.
[50:07.010 --> 50:07.490]  I'm with you, Nick.
[50:08.130 --> 50:08.510]  Thank you.
[50:09.730 --> 50:10.570]  Nice, good kill.
[50:10.770 --> 50:11.290]  Thank you!
[50:11.970 --> 50:12.450]  Ooh, what's this?
[50:13.270 --> 50:15.630]  I was gonna say, are we like... so we're like checking these things?
[50:17.650 --> 50:18.090]  Okay.
[50:18.350 --> 50:19.310]  I'm going up.
[50:19.490 --> 50:20.490]  Oh, I got a gold pouch.
[50:22.010 --> 50:22.310]  Nice.
[50:23.190 --> 50:24.220]  Oh no, they fucking respawned.
[50:25.630 --> 50:26.050]  Don't do that.
[50:26.390 --> 50:28.170]  We're gonna have to fight a few waves of them.
[50:28.290 --> 50:29.170]  Like, you guys all left.
[50:29.250 --> 50:31.170]  I was in this room and suddenly I turned around and they were all back again.
[50:31.210 --> 50:31.670]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[50:31.910 --> 50:32.390]  No, that's okay.
[50:33.590 --> 50:34.070]  That's okay.
[50:34.130 --> 50:34.630]  I took care of them.
[50:35.490 --> 50:36.010]  I'm deadly.
[50:36.090 --> 50:36.370]  Good job.
[50:37.590 --> 50:38.090]  I'm deadly.
[50:39.330 --> 50:40.190]  Where'd you guys go?
[50:41.770 --> 50:42.350]  I got your back.
[50:42.350 --> 50:43.250]  Oh, thank you very much, Nick.
[50:43.510 --> 50:44.330]  Did you guys go downstairs?
[50:44.810 --> 50:45.150]  We went up.
[50:45.170 --> 50:45.630]  I went up.
[50:46.030 --> 50:46.190]  Oh.
[50:46.350 --> 50:47.450]  Ooh, here's a skull.
[50:47.730 --> 50:48.330]  Do I want that?
[50:49.150 --> 50:49.910]  Yeah, take it.
[50:49.910 --> 50:51.070]  Ooh, what's this?
[50:51.110 --> 50:52.290]  A fortress storeroom key.
[50:52.510 --> 50:53.690]  We're gonna eventually load all that stuff onto the boat.
[50:53.930 --> 50:55.530]  I have a key for the storeroom.
[50:55.750 --> 50:56.170]  I got a...
[50:56.170 --> 50:56.510]  Oh, cool.
[50:56.530 --> 50:57.110]  Oh, nice.
[50:57.370 --> 50:57.970]  Is that down?
[50:58.770 --> 50:59.770]  Go to the top.
[50:59.830 --> 51:01.070]  You can unlock it at the very top.
[51:01.210 --> 51:01.970]  The very top.
[51:02.010 --> 51:02.170]  Okay.
[51:03.350 --> 51:03.710]  This?
[51:04.150 --> 51:04.510]  Yes!
[51:05.890 --> 51:06.530]  We're in!
[51:07.390 --> 51:07.750]  Cool.
[51:07.970 --> 51:08.290]  Nice.
[51:08.390 --> 51:08.790]  Good job, Nick.
[51:09.410 --> 51:09.950]  Thank you.
[51:10.110 --> 51:11.250]  Ooh, Eric, look at this.
[51:11.490 --> 51:13.290]  A sapphire mermaid gem.
[51:13.770 --> 51:14.130]  Cool.
[51:14.650 --> 51:15.970]  I guess I'll take this back to the ship.
[51:15.970 --> 51:16.690]  Oh, I'm fighting...
[51:16.690 --> 51:17.850]  There's like three guys on me?
[51:17.990 --> 51:18.470]  Oh boy.
[51:19.910 --> 51:21.190]  The first four guys are back.
[51:21.210 --> 51:21.850]  Oh, they're gone.
[51:23.590 --> 51:25.670]  Kill you guys over and over again, huh?
[51:26.050 --> 51:26.910]  What the fuck?
[51:27.030 --> 51:28.170]  Why are there three guys on me?
[51:28.210 --> 51:28.530]  Ah!
[51:28.870 --> 51:30.570]  Andrew, what's the best way to get this stuff back to the ship?
[51:31.510 --> 51:32.150]  Uh, just...
[51:32.150 --> 51:32.950]  I'm killing them, Eric.
[51:32.950 --> 51:33.290]  What you're doing.
[51:33.490 --> 51:33.570]  Don't worry.
[51:33.670 --> 51:33.970]  Thank you.
[51:33.970 --> 51:36.030]  Unless we get a chest we can drop it into.
[51:36.170 --> 51:36.510]  Got it.
[51:36.570 --> 51:38.210]  Sometimes you'll find an empty chest in there.
[51:38.350 --> 51:39.190]  Don't forget to eat, Eric.
[51:39.790 --> 51:40.870]  I'm eating right now.
[51:42.630 --> 51:43.790]  Alright, is there anything else upstairs?
[51:44.130 --> 51:44.530]  Just drop it.
[51:44.550 --> 51:46.410]  I didn't see anything, but I didn't look real good.
[51:47.350 --> 51:49.090]  There's stuff in the storeroom, I think, still.
[51:49.330 --> 51:50.170]  Which is on the...
[51:50.170 --> 51:51.270]  Oh, yeah, there definitely is.
[51:51.310 --> 51:52.910]  There's chests of the damned and stuff.
[51:53.470 --> 51:53.650]  Cool.
[51:53.930 --> 51:54.250]  Oh, sweet.
[51:56.070 --> 51:57.350]  Oh no, the ghosts are back.
[51:57.990 --> 51:58.350]  No!
[51:59.370 --> 51:59.850]  It's alright.
[52:00.570 --> 52:00.930]  Cool.
[52:01.190 --> 52:01.390]  Ah!
[52:05.560 --> 52:06.200]  Alright, there's one.
[52:06.200 --> 52:06.660]  Leave me alone!
[52:06.960 --> 52:07.800]  Can we go back and get the rest?
[52:08.540 --> 52:09.420]  Yep, just keep going.
[52:16.200 --> 52:17.680]  Alright, you boys still with me?
[52:18.560 --> 52:18.960]  I'm up.
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.380]  I'm at the top with Nick.
[52:21.760 --> 52:21.960]  Okay.
[52:22.080 --> 52:22.500]  Let's see.
[52:24.280 --> 52:25.160]  Gunpowder barrel.
[52:26.340 --> 52:27.460]  Ooh, a lid.
[52:27.900 --> 52:29.200]  Ooh, a cannonball barrel.
[52:30.720 --> 52:31.160]  Ah!
[52:31.320 --> 52:32.260]  That's not Eric at all!
[52:34.940 --> 52:36.700]  Do we want the chest of the damned?
[52:37.200 --> 52:37.380]  Yeah.
[52:37.580 --> 52:37.900]  Yes.
[52:38.780 --> 52:39.220]  Okay.
[52:43.960 --> 52:44.840]  I want that.
[52:45.500 --> 52:45.940]  Okay.
[52:46.000 --> 52:46.700]  I have it.
[52:46.960 --> 52:47.560]  Ooh, there's a hat.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.520]  Grab that bad boy and take him to the...
[52:50.160 --> 52:51.240]  Do I just take it down to the boat?
[52:52.140 --> 52:55.760]  Just drop it in front of the harpoon.
[52:56.540 --> 52:57.820]  We can harpoon it later.
[52:58.100 --> 52:58.840]  Where's the harpoon?
[52:59.580 --> 53:00.320]  On the boat.
[53:00.440 --> 53:00.860]  On our boat.
[53:01.200 --> 53:02.520]  He's saying drop it in the water.
[53:03.280 --> 53:07.500]  No, I'm saying drop it on the cement in front of the harpoon.
[53:08.440 --> 53:09.180]  I got you covered.
[53:10.360 --> 53:10.780]  Ah!
[53:11.420 --> 53:12.560]  Now I understand.
[53:12.700 --> 53:12.920]  Thank you.
[53:14.480 --> 53:14.900]  Ow!
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.060]  You son of a bitch!
[53:16.420 --> 53:17.920]  Alright, I dropped a crate in front of the harpoon.
[53:18.980 --> 53:20.540]  I think we killed the phantoms now.
[53:21.180 --> 53:21.620]  Yeah.
[53:21.760 --> 53:22.160]  Phantom.
[53:22.740 --> 53:24.000]  Yeah, just keep killing phantoms.
[53:25.520 --> 53:27.500]  Does anybody have the fortress treasure key?
[53:27.640 --> 53:29.300]  Because there's a whole room full of treasure right here.
[53:29.400 --> 53:31.760]  We'll get that once we kill the boss.
[53:31.880 --> 53:32.440]  The phantom boss.
[53:32.600 --> 53:32.700]  Okay.
[53:33.120 --> 53:35.200]  He's going to keep fighting waves of them until it spawns.
[53:36.460 --> 53:37.280]  Let me eat my banana.
[53:38.240 --> 53:38.640]  Banana.
[53:42.220 --> 53:43.280]  So many phantoms.
[53:44.100 --> 53:45.160]  I'm here to help.
[53:45.860 --> 53:46.380]  I have a coconut.
[53:46.600 --> 53:46.960]  Thank you.
[53:51.490 --> 53:52.290]  Got it.
[53:52.330 --> 53:52.770]  Thank you.
[53:52.970 --> 53:54.430]  Fucking wasted his monkey ass.
[53:55.090 --> 53:55.830]  Ooh, a hatch.
[53:57.390 --> 53:58.110]  A hatch?
[53:58.290 --> 53:58.790]  Oh, wow.
[53:59.430 --> 54:01.310]  Oh, it's just a shortcut to the lower level.
[54:01.890 --> 54:02.090]  Oh.
[54:02.310 --> 54:02.690]  Boo.
[54:02.950 --> 54:03.350]  Boo.
[54:03.430 --> 54:04.090]  Not secret.
[54:04.250 --> 54:05.270]  This is what we want.
[54:05.390 --> 54:07.170]  We want to get in right here.
[54:08.410 --> 54:09.390]  Look inside there.
[54:09.650 --> 54:10.270]  See all that treasure?
[54:10.490 --> 54:10.750]  Oh!
[54:11.870 --> 54:13.630]  We're looking for like a key or something?
[54:13.790 --> 54:14.150]  After we kill the phantoms.
[54:14.150 --> 54:17.550]  Oh, we got to keep fighting phantoms and then the boss one will spawn and he'll drop it.
[54:17.890 --> 54:19.650]  There's more food down here.
[54:19.710 --> 54:21.050]  We got food down in this area.
[54:24.470 --> 54:26.090]  This music rules, by the way.
[54:29.230 --> 54:30.610]  I don't see anybody to kill.
[54:30.970 --> 54:31.210]  Ah!
[54:32.310 --> 54:33.210]  I think Nick found him.
[54:33.690 --> 54:34.630]  Yep, Nick found him.
[54:37.950 --> 54:40.070]  Oh, man, that guy just got stabbed in the back several times.
[54:40.070 --> 54:41.110]  Oh, I think I see the boss.
[54:41.670 --> 54:41.970]  Yeah?
[54:42.050 --> 54:42.910]  I thought I saw red text.
[54:43.290 --> 54:43.670]  What level?
[54:44.030 --> 54:44.490]  Like, what floor?
[54:44.970 --> 54:45.370]  Ow!
[54:46.030 --> 54:46.370]  Ow!
[54:46.870 --> 54:47.490]  Very top?
[54:47.590 --> 54:47.750]  Okay.
[54:48.170 --> 54:48.650]  Pippity top?
[54:50.570 --> 54:51.350]  Leave me be, prick.
[54:51.410 --> 54:51.590]  Here we go.
[54:53.090 --> 54:53.750]  All the way up.
[54:53.770 --> 54:54.290]  Here we go, boys.
[54:54.390 --> 54:54.630]  Let's do it.
[54:55.070 --> 54:55.810]  All the way up.
[54:56.250 --> 54:56.830]  Let's do it.
[54:57.550 --> 54:58.370]  Make sure you're eating.
[54:58.570 --> 54:59.570]  Make sure you're healing.
[54:59.630 --> 55:00.250]  He's right here, Andrew.
[55:00.370 --> 55:00.710]  There he is.
[55:01.010 --> 55:01.370]  We're coming.
[55:01.510 --> 55:01.730]  We're coming.
[55:01.930 --> 55:02.990]  Me and Geoff are right behind you guys.
[55:04.770 --> 55:06.090]  He keeps disappearing and reappearing.
[55:06.130 --> 55:06.850]  Well, we're up top.
[55:06.950 --> 55:07.450]  I don't see him.
[55:07.490 --> 55:07.650]  Yep.
[55:08.130 --> 55:08.530]  Got him.
[55:08.870 --> 55:09.270]  He's dead.
[55:09.870 --> 55:10.930]  So what do you think, Geoff?
[55:10.950 --> 55:12.010]  What do you think top floor means?
[55:12.130 --> 55:12.910]  I don't know.
[55:13.450 --> 55:14.810]  We were in the middle of the fight.
[55:15.010 --> 55:15.170]  Sorry.
[55:15.170 --> 55:15.410]  Sorry, yeah.
[55:15.490 --> 55:16.290]  It wasn't top top.
[55:16.430 --> 55:18.650]  It was second to the top.
[55:19.690 --> 55:20.870]  But I got the fortress key.
[55:21.070 --> 55:21.210]  Come on.
[55:21.370 --> 55:21.930]  Oh, hell yeah.
[55:24.170 --> 55:24.830]  Here we go.
[55:25.570 --> 55:26.210]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[55:28.030 --> 55:28.870]  Unlock the door.
[55:29.230 --> 55:29.830]  Wait a minute.
[55:30.770 --> 55:31.090]  Yay!
[55:32.050 --> 55:32.450]  Achievement.
[55:32.650 --> 55:33.930]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[55:33.990 --> 55:35.230]  Let's get this stuff.
[55:35.250 --> 55:36.110]  I got an achievement for that.
[55:37.830 --> 55:38.730]  Loads of money.
[55:38.770 --> 55:38.970]  It's like gold.
[55:40.310 --> 55:41.070]  Take a seat.
[55:41.430 --> 55:42.090]  I'm gonna do that.
[55:45.010 --> 55:46.590]  I got the Skull of the Damned.
[55:46.790 --> 55:49.450]  I guess it's not the Skull of the Damned, it's more like a Skull of the Damned.
[55:51.570 --> 55:53.530]  It's a Skull of some Damned.
[55:54.010 --> 55:55.350]  It's a Damned Skull.
[55:55.670 --> 55:57.030]  Yeah, a Skull of a Damned.
[55:58.810 --> 56:00.990]  So now let's just line everything up for that harpoon.
[56:01.330 --> 56:03.470]  Uh, let's get all the bags of gold, too.
[56:03.610 --> 56:05.230]  Why can't we take all the bags of gold, too?
[56:05.350 --> 56:06.170]  There's more stuff.
[56:06.250 --> 56:06.590]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:06.590 --> 56:07.550]  There's more stuff in here, too.
[56:07.610 --> 56:10.750]  If someone wants to go harpoon and start getting it going, that's fine.
[56:10.750 --> 56:12.050]  Villainous bounty skull.
[56:12.830 --> 56:13.970]  Uh, it's something worth taking.
[56:14.550 --> 56:15.730]  Yeah, absolutely we are.
[56:16.710 --> 56:18.630]  Beastie boys always on vacation.
[56:22.870 --> 56:24.270]  Oh, guys, open doors.
[56:24.270 --> 56:24.650]  Oh, here we go.
[56:26.270 --> 56:28.370]  God, it takes so long to open these fucking doors.
[56:28.450 --> 56:28.750]  There we go.
[56:29.110 --> 56:29.810]  Jesus Christ.
[56:30.670 --> 56:31.490]  Okay, got the gold pouch.
[56:31.530 --> 56:32.930]  Ooh, a crate of rare tea.
[56:34.730 --> 56:36.030]  Hey, captain's chest.
[56:36.290 --> 56:36.830]  Take this.
[56:38.650 --> 56:39.590]  This might be the best.
[56:40.170 --> 56:43.210]  I got a crate of exotic skills.
[56:43.670 --> 56:44.110]  Oh.
[56:44.330 --> 56:44.610]  Silks.
[56:44.810 --> 56:45.610]  Silks, probably.
[56:45.910 --> 56:46.530]  Is that what it was?
[56:46.750 --> 56:47.170]  Yeah.
[56:47.610 --> 56:48.290]  What do you mean, no?
[56:48.530 --> 56:49.170]  No, the skills.
[56:49.350 --> 56:50.590]  The skills are really exotic.
[56:50.870 --> 56:52.190]  What kind of skills did you learn, Eric?
[56:52.490 --> 56:52.930]  Skills.
[56:53.270 --> 56:54.810]  S-I-L-K-S.
[56:54.930 --> 56:55.690]  Skills, idiot.
[56:57.010 --> 56:57.730]  What'd you learn?
[56:58.010 --> 56:58.490]  Look at this.
[56:58.750 --> 56:59.830]  No, I didn't learn shit.
[57:00.130 --> 57:00.250]  Okay.
[57:00.970 --> 57:02.390]  Whoa, Andrew has the cannon?
[57:03.430 --> 57:04.450]  It's a portable cannon.
[57:04.570 --> 57:04.890]  It's new.
[57:04.990 --> 57:06.050]  I haven't really used it that much.
[57:06.090 --> 57:06.290]  Wow.
[57:06.290 --> 57:06.910]  That's awesome.
[57:06.910 --> 57:08.410]  The cannon gets hot with user damage.
[57:08.510 --> 57:09.830]  You manage the heat to avoid an explosion.
[57:10.110 --> 57:10.230]  Okay.
[57:10.890 --> 57:12.170]  There's one chest at my feet.
[57:12.570 --> 57:13.230]  You wanna grab that one?
[57:13.290 --> 57:13.430]  Yep.
[57:13.770 --> 57:14.190]  Got it.
[57:15.510 --> 57:16.150]  Captain's chest.
[57:16.510 --> 57:16.790]  We good?
[57:17.750 --> 57:20.730]  Have a look one more time just to do a sweep and then that might be it.
[57:21.350 --> 57:23.610]  Guys, I don't wanna speak out of turn here, but I might like this.
[57:23.850 --> 57:29.230]  This might be the best loot run anybody's ever had in the history of this game.
[57:29.270 --> 57:30.330]  It's real good.
[57:30.750 --> 57:32.230]  Oh, this isn't how it usually goes?
[57:32.390 --> 57:32.650]  No.
[57:32.830 --> 57:33.530]  No, it's...
[57:33.530 --> 57:34.210]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[57:34.230 --> 57:34.790]  Not when I play.
[57:34.790 --> 57:36.710]  This might be...
[57:36.710 --> 57:41.470]  This isn't all that not reflective of typical sessions that I've had.
[57:41.510 --> 57:41.830]  Now me!
[57:42.050 --> 57:42.230]  Ah!
[57:43.930 --> 57:44.770]  I got you.
[57:45.070 --> 57:45.830]  It worked.
[57:47.470 --> 57:49.430]  Our boat looks like shit.
[57:50.450 --> 57:51.390]  It took some damage.
[57:51.410 --> 57:51.910]  Well, it's not a rough day.
[57:52.190 --> 57:53.190]  Oh my god.
[57:55.230 --> 57:58.730]  Let's go southwest and we can... or just south actually.
[57:58.930 --> 57:59.490]  We're close.
[57:59.730 --> 58:00.250]  Let's just go south.
[58:00.790 --> 58:01.550]  We can cash out.
[58:02.650 --> 58:03.270]  Call it a day.
[58:03.970 --> 58:09.990]  How this works, Eric, is we have all this loot, but we don't get any credit for any of it until we sell it back.
[58:10.110 --> 58:10.930]  Oh my god.
[58:10.970 --> 58:12.790]  Okay, well, let's avoid fights.
[58:13.910 --> 58:14.570]  Don't say that.
[58:14.590 --> 58:16.110]  Steals everything, we lose everything.
[58:16.430 --> 58:18.430]  Okay, so anchor's up and we're away?
[58:18.810 --> 58:19.030]  Yep.
[58:19.610 --> 58:19.990]  Anchor's up.
[58:19.990 --> 58:21.190]  Oh, we had a little bump.
[58:21.370 --> 58:22.950]  I'll go... me and Nick will go check the bottom.
[58:23.070 --> 58:24.690]  Yeah, there seems to be water coming in.
[58:25.270 --> 58:25.550]  Yeah.
[58:27.470 --> 58:28.470]  There's the outpost.
[58:28.750 --> 58:29.290]  Where's a hole?
[58:29.830 --> 58:30.470]  I got it already.
[58:30.870 --> 58:31.870]  I see a player boat.
[58:32.630 --> 58:33.050]  No.
[58:34.010 --> 58:34.430]  What?
[58:34.530 --> 58:34.770]  No.
[58:34.990 --> 58:35.370]  No, no.
[58:35.450 --> 58:36.850]  No, you don't.
[58:36.950 --> 58:37.370]  Shut up.
[58:38.570 --> 58:39.530]  You heard the man, shut up.
[58:39.530 --> 58:40.010]  Where's the loot?
[58:40.290 --> 58:41.170]  It's coming this way.
[58:41.590 --> 58:41.810]  Where?
[58:42.050 --> 58:42.930]  No way.
[58:43.550 --> 58:43.970]  Where?
[58:51.130 --> 58:54.170]  We might be able to sell everything before they get to us.
[58:54.250 --> 58:55.130]  Yeah, let's do it.
[58:55.130 --> 58:56.070]  Let's do it.
[58:59.270 --> 59:02.270]  Because that outpost is literally the island in front of us.
[59:03.750 --> 59:05.230]  Do we need to re-angle them?
[59:06.090 --> 59:06.290]  Yeah.
[59:06.710 --> 59:07.690]  Sail length lowered.
[59:08.130 --> 59:08.710]  Sail's lowered.
[59:09.130 --> 59:10.250]  Lower them until they catch wind.
[59:10.490 --> 59:11.510]  Or change them until they catch wind.
[59:12.610 --> 59:14.090]  Wouldn't that be taking us the wrong direction though?
[59:14.950 --> 59:15.830]  Yeah, which way are we going?
[59:17.030 --> 59:19.250]  Going to the right of this island.
[59:23.990 --> 59:25.390]  And could you...
[59:25.390 --> 59:27.930]  We're going like backwards from where the wind's blowing.
[59:28.770 --> 59:30.670]  Yeah, that happens a lot in this game.
[59:30.930 --> 59:33.950]  Oh cool, it's everything I loved about Wind Waker. Awesome.
[59:36.470 --> 59:38.570]  This guy's positive and negative all over the place on this game.
[59:40.370 --> 59:42.490]  Well, he was like that about Wind Waker too.
[59:43.630 --> 59:45.970]  Yeah, I'm overall negative on Wind Waker.
[59:46.730 --> 59:47.070]  Oh really?
[59:47.430 --> 59:48.350]  I didn't like it.
[59:49.230 --> 59:50.450]  Hey, get in this boat.
[59:51.390 --> 59:51.890]  Uh, no.
[59:52.870 --> 59:55.350]  They fixed it on the HD remake or whatever.
[59:56.090 --> 59:57.490]  Brother, I ain't playing it again.
[59:57.490 --> 59:59.050]  We're getting pretty close to these rocks, Andrew.
[59:59.650 --> 01:00:01.430]  Yeah, you want to steer us a little right, Owen?
[01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:02.330]  Okay, I'll do it.
[01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.910]  Head right, hard right, hard right, hard right, hard right.
[01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.850]  Oh boy.
[01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.490]  We're alright. You're good. We got it.
[01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:09.170]  You good? Okay, cool.
[01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:10.930]  Yeah, that was good.
[01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:16.090]  Oh my god, please operate it. Yes, I don't know where we're going.
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:17.970]  Can you, uh...
[01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:19.830]  Do you want the angles changed or what?
[01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.910]  Let's start raising sails a little bit.
[01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:24.470]  Raising, okay.
[01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:25.850]  About halfway?
[01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:29.230]  Uh, let's take two sails fully up.
[01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.370]  I'll take the front one fully up.
[01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:32.730]  Okay, I'll bring...
[01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:34.390]  I'll leave mine down then.
[01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:39.110]  Right, right. They're bringing theirs all the way up. I'm leaving mine down.
[01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:40.010]  Okay.
[01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:43.130]  Is that what you want? You want something else?
[01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:45.750]  Yeah. No, we're good. Okay, let's do all sails up now.
[01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.890]  All sails up?
[01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:51.610]  All sails up?
[01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:55.430]  Yeah, Geoff wants to hit this button bad, so just let him know.
[01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:59.410]  Coming in looking good.
[01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:00.950]  Good work, boys.
[01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:02.590]  Great work.
[01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:04.690]  Okay, Geoff, lower anchor.
[01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:07.970]  Lowering anchor.
[01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:13.790]  Do we have to carry all this or can we...
[01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.930]  No, just leave it. I can harpoon it over.
[01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:17.270]  Oh, really?
[01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:19.510]  That's one set.
[01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:23.050]  Should we have two harpoon people harpoon it?
[01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:26.510]  Oh, uh, do not think he needs us.
[01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:27.170]  No.
[01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:29.410]  Hang on.
[01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:32.230]  So if you want to hop over here and you can start selling the stuff.
[01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:35.070]  Whoa!
[01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.290]  It took me over here. You harpooned me?
[01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:39.870]  Yep. Sorry.
[01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.650]  I was moving. There was like another chest that was like lower and then all of a sudden I was over here.
[01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.330]  Uh, what do we do to sell it?
[01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.510]  Just talk to this guy?
[01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.150]  Yeah, just grab it and then hand it to them.
[01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:54.030]  Oh, we have to pick it up.
[01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:56.250]  Yeah, you have to physically...
[01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:00.710]  And then give storage? Is that what it is?
[01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.970]  Yeah.
[01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.750]  Okay.
[01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.910]  There you go. Okay, now just keep doing that.
[01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:05.350]  Okay.
[01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:12.230]  No, don't talk to him. I don't care what he has to say. Give him the skull.
[01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:15.290]  Okay.
[01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:17.810]  You tried to do...
[01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.710]  Let's try to adjust it for you.
[01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:23.390]  One sec.
[01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:26.110]  One sec. Hold. Hold your fire, Geoff.
[01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:28.970]  Hold your fire, Geoff!
[01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.390]  I don't doubt it.
[01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:39.370]  I just... I assume what we're getting right here is...
[01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:41.310]  I assume we're getting like a lot of money.
[01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:42.990]  I assume this is like a lot of money.
[01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:44.790]  It's so much money, dude.
[01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:47.210]  Can I buy a pet?
[01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:50.050]  No, that's different money. That's real money.
[01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:50.510]  No!
[01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.950]  No!
[01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:53.870]  Just one more.
[01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:57.410]  Thank you.
[01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:58.390]  Alright, there we go. That's it, right?
[01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:03.090]  I'm about to get a deed of progress
[01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:04.510]  update thing where it's hand him
[01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:05.490]  25 things.
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.490]  Nice.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.240]  Guys, unfortunately, I think we have to
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.480]  play this game more soon.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.860]  I'm high three, man. I'm right there with you.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.600]  I know Andrew doesn't want to play with us, but we'll have to.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.320]  This is great.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.400]  Ooh, here, have this thing of tea.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.100]  Shit in.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.380]  I gotta say, if Gavin were here, I don't think it would have
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.240]  gone this well. Oh yeah. No!
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.440]  Wait, are we selling the cannon or are we keeping it?
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.220]  Yeah, we can sell it. Uh, you gotta
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.640]  take it to the other side. Can't take it with you, Nick.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.480]  If you want, you just drop it and I'll
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.160]  go sell it. Okay. Thank you.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.040]  I'm giving this guy a lot of skulls.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.460]  At least we can sell all this stuff to him. Usually, you gotta go run
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:49.560]  all over the fucking place.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.020]  These guys are real fucking dancing, dude.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.760]  Got a lot of skulls.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.780]  This guy wants your skulls.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.120]  He needs your skulls.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.060]  Yeah, and when you die, he'll want yours for real.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.740]  Alright, there you go.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.940]  That's everything.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:06.600]  So I have... Hell yeah.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.320]  77,000... 78,000...
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.900]  Oh, it's still... Oh my god, it's
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:12.940]  still tallying up.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.860]  Oh my god.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.820]  Let it all cash out and then we'll get all our
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.380]  We'll shoot up.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.060]  We'll shoot up?
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.520]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.880]  Let's fucking shoot up.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.240]  I'm gonna have a seat in here.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.540]  Sure has.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.140]  Our wallets have it.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.400]  Oh, the wallets are looking fat.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.960]  Well, now we can buy a new boat.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.360]  Yeah, next time we play,
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.280]  we should customize it.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.480]  I can't believe
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.240]  Louie costs actual money. That sucks.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.880]  Louie was a Twitch drop.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.160]  Oh, really? Damn it.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.760]  A Twitch drop.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.100]  I think we're getting close.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.100]  Here we go, 428. I think that's all
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.620]  the gold. Now let's see that rep.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.200]  Let's get those numbers
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.200]  going up. What do we... What do we do?
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.420]  We'll just sit here.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.000]  This is catching up in the bottom of your screen.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.060]  British Jackals earned milestone class
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.340]  one and treasure sold to the Merchant Alliance.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.000]  I don't... Nothing's
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.080]  popping up on my screen. You earned milestone class
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.700]  one and treasure sold to the Sovereigns.
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.180]  You guys aren't getting this? Nope.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:21.240]  British Jackals earned milestone class
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.940]  eight in gold earned. Eric,
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.300]  you know what's going to be a real mother?
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.080]  Is when we find out that we had to activate
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.560]  something to get credit for it. Oh, yeah.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.360]  100%.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.200]  Let's make sure you're in the guild.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.020]  Not that... You don't lose anything
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.620]  for not being in it.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.400]  How do I do this?
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.380]  Guild emotes. Guild invite.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.240]  Here. You guys interact with this.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.200]  Interact with...
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.300]  You are already in this guild.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.180]  Join guild.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.260]  Wait, did you just take it away before I joined it?
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.540]  That's pretty cool. Right on.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:54.460]  Here we go.
[01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:00.530]  I'm going to join your guild.
[01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:02.730]  Success. There we go.
[01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.970]  Okay.
[01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:05.990]  I'm getting so much stuff.
[01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:09.290]  I did it. Thank you, Andrew. Merchant Alliance
[01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:11.310]  reputation increased. I don't...
[01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:13.370]  Does that reset
[01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:15.690]  at some point, Andrew? No. Seasonally
[01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:17.810]  or something? Okay. No. That does not.
[01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:19.590]  Uh, so it doesn't seem
[01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:21.470]  like you got pop-ups, but if you guys hit start
[01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:23.330]  and then go to pirate log. Yeah.
[01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:25.410]  And then click reputation.
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:27.750]  Yeah. You should see what your numbers
[01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.530]  are now for like what levels. How much
[01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:31.630]  you leveled up and all that in each of these factions.
[01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:34.110]  Oh! Builders, crew, the build rats.
[01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:35.750]  I have build rats
[01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:37.330]  and... I don't know.
[01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:39.590]  You should have gold hoarders and...
[01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:41.730]  Order of Souls.
[01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.230]  Merchant Alliance 7.
[01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:45.930]  Gold hoarders 7.
[01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.910]  Nice. Yeah. What's your
[01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:48.930]  highest number, Andrew?
[01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:52.010]  Uh, I think I'm 129
[01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:53.670]  in one. Jesus Christ.
[01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:55.850]  That's crazy. Do you get something for doing this?
[01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:57.670]  Uh, you get...
[01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.890]  The ability to like unlock new quests
[01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:02.090]  and like outfits
[01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:02.850]  and that type of thing.
[01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:06.250]  Guys, this was a great sailing adventure.
[01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:08.130]  Yes, it was. I had so much fun.
[01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:09.930]  Can't wait to do this again.
[01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:12.210]  Thank you all so much for watching.

[01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.250]  Andrew's audition. You sure did!
[01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:27.490]  We get to play Sea of Thieves again. This is great!
[01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:29.570]  Wow! Hooray!
[01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:31.570]  We did it?
[01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:34.230]  We did it! Bye!
