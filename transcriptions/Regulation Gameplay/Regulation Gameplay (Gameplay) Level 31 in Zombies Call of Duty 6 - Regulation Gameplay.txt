[00:00.000 --> 00:02.840]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:02.920 --> 00:05.880]  We're back at Zombies, but we know what we're doing this time,
[00:05.920 --> 00:08.280]  or at least some of us do. Nick, you excited?
[00:08.780 --> 00:10.280]  Yeah, I'm scared.
[00:10.760 --> 00:12.380]  I hope I don't drag us down.
[00:12.820 --> 00:14.340]  So don't worry, I'm in charge of that.
[00:14.820 --> 00:16.600]  Oh, oh, oh, it's Gavin's job.
[00:16.740 --> 00:17.200]  Are you sure?
[00:17.660 --> 00:20.960]  It shows you guys all is level one to me, but I'm assuming that's not the case.
[00:21.100 --> 00:23.760]  Yeah, it's it's like a quick resume bug, I think.
[00:24.160 --> 00:28.220]  The goal of this is to hit wave 31 and pass it,
[00:28.220 --> 00:31.180]  because this is going to come out in December, I assume.
[00:31.580 --> 00:33.740]  And we're we're doing a whole 31 thing.
[00:34.260 --> 00:36.560]  We did a draft that was 31 based.
[00:37.260 --> 00:40.160]  It's a real embracing of 31, 31 days in the month.
[00:40.700 --> 00:44.400]  Speaking of embracing 31, we should also point out that, yes,
[00:44.420 --> 00:46.400]  we know July has 31 days in it.
[00:47.020 --> 00:47.820]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[00:48.040 --> 00:49.400]  When was that for?
[00:50.400 --> 00:53.740]  You mentioned you made it sound like we thought there were 30 days in July
[00:53.740 --> 00:56.940]  when we were trying to pick a month to have dogs and cream every day.
[00:56.940 --> 01:00.380]  Oh, do we ever determine who came up with that draft?
[01:00.640 --> 01:02.580]  Audience jumped on it.
[01:02.920 --> 01:07.360]  Uh, no, but it's got to be in the annals of regulation history somewhere, right?
[01:07.400 --> 01:11.120]  We just need a regulation historian to go back and crack some books.
[01:12.060 --> 01:15.920]  It's the funniest descriptor for a thing that happened like six days ago.
[01:16.000 --> 01:16.480]  The episode.
[01:18.600 --> 01:20.420]  I don't even know if the book has been published.
[01:20.780 --> 01:22.940]  And if it has, it's certainly not been creased.
[01:23.420 --> 01:24.240]  Who needs to ready up?
[01:25.900 --> 01:26.260]  Pfft.
[01:26.320 --> 01:26.880]  We're three or four.
[01:27.780 --> 01:28.680]  It unreadied me.
[01:29.100 --> 01:29.600]  It unreadied me.
[01:29.600 --> 01:31.440]  Oh, the first to ready up guy.
[01:31.560 --> 01:33.220]  He declared he was first to ready.
[01:33.340 --> 01:34.240]  We're all just waiting.
[01:34.420 --> 01:35.700]  I didn't realize that's already up twice.
[01:36.180 --> 01:37.020]  Are we doing Terminus?
[01:37.960 --> 01:39.460]  Are we? Oh, I did Terminus.
[01:39.960 --> 01:41.380]  I guess we're doing Terminus.
[01:41.540 --> 01:42.660]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:42.760 --> 01:44.640]  Well, Terminus, I just noticed that we were doing that one.
[01:45.540 --> 01:47.040]  Wasn't the other one the one we'd been doing?
[01:47.380 --> 01:51.020]  It was, but listen, I've done both at this point, so we'll be fine.
[01:51.780 --> 01:52.320]  What? It's perfect.
[01:52.460 --> 01:53.320]  Is Terminus easy? He's done it.
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.680]  No, it's hard.
[01:54.800 --> 01:55.720]  It's the one we did before.
[01:55.880 --> 01:56.820]  But hey, we can get some redemption.
[01:57.040 --> 01:59.600]  That was a really bad run the first time we did this.
[02:01.100 --> 02:02.140]  Yeah, OK, really bad.
[02:02.620 --> 02:03.240]  I'm going to quit.
[02:03.360 --> 02:06.120]  So what we need to do is turn on the power just so we can unlock the pack.
[02:07.580 --> 02:08.700]  All we got to do is do what now?
[02:08.820 --> 02:11.180]  We got to turn the power on the amp generators
[02:11.860 --> 02:14.840]  and turn these things on so we can power up the pack a punch.
[02:15.540 --> 02:18.080]  Once we do that, we don't really need to do any other objectives.
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.200]  It's just about living.
[02:20.020 --> 02:21.140]  Hey, well, that guy wasn't a zombie.
[02:21.540 --> 02:22.680]  Nobody was shooting at us.
[02:22.920 --> 02:25.220]  Oh, it's still bad.
[02:25.340 --> 02:27.440]  What are we? Anti-human, too?
[02:27.780 --> 02:30.080]  We're anti-people trying to kill us, I think.
[02:31.420 --> 02:35.120]  I don't think we discriminate if they are undead or people just shooting.
[02:36.860 --> 02:40.900]  I definitely feel that question the morality of it more before pulling the trigger,
[02:40.960 --> 02:42.920]  though, even if they shoot first.
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.360]  Yeah, but then I pull the trigger anyway.
[02:44.980 --> 02:48.700]  I feel like it's it's a bigger deal to take a living life.
[02:48.700 --> 02:51.980]  Yeah, it's it's a bigger deal to take a life than an unlife, I think.
[02:52.360 --> 02:56.620]  In the words of Rick Grimes, we don't want a rampage inducer round accelerant.
[02:56.780 --> 02:58.220]  Oh, let's not do that.
[02:58.540 --> 03:01.900]  Where's the gun? We need to get to pack a punch in my hand.
[03:02.520 --> 03:04.340]  Oh, yeah. Shit. I need to find that.
[03:05.200 --> 03:07.180]  All right. Yeah, it's right here. It's on the wall right here.
[03:08.000 --> 03:08.700]  So what do we do?
[03:08.760 --> 03:10.200]  We just grab this gun, Nick.
[03:10.940 --> 03:14.320]  OK. OK, so we fucked up the generator, so we got to do that again.
[03:15.580 --> 03:16.500]  How do we fuck it up?
[03:16.640 --> 03:17.780]  We need to protect it.
[03:17.780 --> 03:19.620]  You see, it has amp health on the screen.
[03:20.360 --> 03:22.460]  Well, it's only going to be harder in level two. Yep.
[03:28.980 --> 03:30.620]  Oh, that's just a factual statement.
[03:32.240 --> 03:35.320]  Well, yeah, it shouldn't be that hard.
[03:37.640 --> 03:39.020]  Oh, Geoff, good camping.
[03:39.140 --> 03:41.060]  Everybody just sort of naturally took a window.
[03:41.200 --> 03:41.860]  That was awesome.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.520]  OK, two.
[03:45.640 --> 03:47.580]  I was playing like a whack-a-mole window game.
[03:47.580 --> 03:48.360]  Here we go. OK.
[03:49.020 --> 03:51.380]  Oh, shit. Nice. Nice.
[03:54.500 --> 03:57.520]  OK, I need ammo.
[03:59.420 --> 04:01.040]  So if we want to move, we can't.
[04:01.100 --> 04:02.460]  Ammo's outside downstairs, I saw.
[04:06.200 --> 04:08.140]  OK, I'm just going to follow you guys.
[04:08.360 --> 04:10.900]  Sure. Are we still do we still do the salvage thing?
[04:11.380 --> 04:13.420]  Yep. Was that somewhere?
[04:13.860 --> 04:15.260]  That is where the package is.
[04:15.260 --> 04:17.840]  So, OK, great. Keep on progressing.
[04:18.020 --> 04:21.500]  And if we follow these orange markers, it will take us to the Pack-A-Punch.
[04:22.180 --> 04:22.800]  Oh, OK.
[04:23.800 --> 04:25.280]  Take us to the Pack-A-Punch.
[04:25.320 --> 04:27.640]  Does someone else want to take me to the Pack-A-Punch?
[04:28.180 --> 04:29.700]  Meet you at the Pack-A-Punch.
[04:30.420 --> 04:31.820]  I'll open the armory.
[04:32.400 --> 04:33.680]  Go inside the armory.
[04:34.200 --> 04:35.340]  There is a computer.
[04:36.020 --> 04:37.020]  Does anybody have the code?
[04:39.100 --> 04:41.480]  I could easily be the lyrics to a song in the future.
[04:41.920 --> 04:42.520]  Yeah, of course.
[04:43.100 --> 04:46.280]  Now, if someone else wants to meet me now, I'll pay half, I'll pay half.
[04:46.460 --> 04:47.960]  I'll go meet me at the Pack-A-Punch.
[04:48.360 --> 04:50.200]  Meet me at the Pack-A-Punch.
[04:50.400 --> 04:51.900]  Yeah. And then there's another generator.
[04:52.020 --> 04:53.440]  If someone wants to activate it for 500.
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.440]  Oh, this thing right here.
[04:57.440 --> 04:58.280]  Oh, it's got it.
[04:58.400 --> 05:00.020]  Oh, I don't have enough, actually. Sorry.
[05:01.560 --> 05:03.000]  Convenient. I don't have the money.
[05:03.300 --> 05:05.000]  Hey, it's not cabinet.
[05:07.060 --> 05:07.860]  Knob. Juggernaut.
[05:08.140 --> 05:08.460]  Knob.
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.880]  A little Christmas Knob, please die.
[05:13.660 --> 05:17.080]  If Christmas, if eggnog gave you properties like juggernaut does,
[05:17.100 --> 05:18.340]  I would eat it or drink it.
[05:18.580 --> 05:20.280]  Then I'd be OK with eggnog.
[05:20.820 --> 05:24.200]  I think it was one of the four life or health benefits consuming.
[05:24.640 --> 05:27.780]  Yeah. Geoff, do you do you think you like it less because it's a liquid?
[05:28.400 --> 05:31.260]  Do you think if it was like frozen, you know, like a frozen treat?
[05:31.420 --> 05:33.700]  Oh, no. Frozen egg sounds terrible, dude.
[05:35.280 --> 05:36.380]  That's why French vanilla.
[05:36.380 --> 05:37.760]  They did. They got it right.
[05:38.740 --> 05:39.440]  Sneak it in.
[05:41.440 --> 05:42.500]  OK. Oh, yeah.
[05:43.080 --> 05:44.320]  Progressing. We learned this.
[05:48.260 --> 05:50.160]  I can't do half. I don't have the money.
[05:51.800 --> 05:54.180]  I can also not do half or any.
[05:54.280 --> 05:55.100]  I have 700 bucks.
[05:55.600 --> 05:56.600]  I don't have any ammo.
[05:56.800 --> 05:58.220]  Let me see the ammo machine.
[05:58.420 --> 06:01.000]  Ammo box is right in here.
[06:01.240 --> 06:01.600]  Here we go. Here we go.
[06:02.040 --> 06:04.480]  Yeah, I'm going to pay half of the door.
[06:04.880 --> 06:05.580]  Sure. Yeah, please.
[06:09.740 --> 06:10.400]  All right.
[06:10.980 --> 06:13.780]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I got the other half.
[06:20.840 --> 06:21.820]  Oh, we got company.
[06:22.740 --> 06:24.060]  Oh, I need a yeah.
[06:24.200 --> 06:25.200]  Yeah, we can keep on moving.
[06:25.300 --> 06:26.580]  The door is open. OK.
[06:27.980 --> 06:29.500]  Right behind you. I want my boom gun.
[06:29.920 --> 06:32.080]  I'm really. Yeah, I'm really jazzed for that boom gun.
[06:32.140 --> 06:34.060]  Dude, we're working on getting there.
[06:35.440 --> 06:37.460]  Yeah, we need to open this cave now.
[06:37.700 --> 06:39.040]  And I put half down. Not yet.
[06:40.660 --> 06:42.280]  Get a few more kills and I should be able to.
[06:45.480 --> 06:46.660]  Got a skull down there.
[06:47.180 --> 06:48.180]  There's a skull. Yeah.
[06:48.220 --> 06:48.840]  What's a skull do?
[06:48.900 --> 06:50.480]  Oh, it's a kill kill rabbit.
[06:50.680 --> 06:51.720]  Oh, OK. He's spawning.
[06:53.580 --> 06:54.640]  Well, nice dive.
[06:55.300 --> 06:56.040]  Got to get it.
[06:57.480 --> 06:59.220]  Got to get that boom, boom, boom.
[06:59.700 --> 07:01.940]  I shot one zombie in the shin and then that was it.
[07:03.300 --> 07:04.480]  That's a bad way to get it.
[07:04.880 --> 07:06.340]  You mentioned death by shin.
[07:06.740 --> 07:08.580]  Oh, man, it would have to hurt.
[07:08.580 --> 07:09.680]  Oh, God.
[07:10.320 --> 07:13.400]  Think about how bad it is to bash your shin on something,
[07:13.540 --> 07:15.480]  but to a degree that you die.
[07:16.040 --> 07:18.340]  Yeah, maybe like if your shin got hit by a train.
[07:21.200 --> 07:22.700]  Oh, I paid for half of that.
[07:22.700 --> 07:24.220]  Oh, my God. I hate that.
[07:25.440 --> 07:26.260]  Train shin.
[07:27.120 --> 07:28.820]  Oh, yeah, it's bad to think about.
[07:29.420 --> 07:30.440]  Oh, nope.
[07:30.440 --> 07:32.800]  Doors open, doors open.
[07:34.020 --> 07:34.880]  I got you, Gavin.
[07:35.980 --> 07:36.500]  Thank you.
[07:37.060 --> 07:41.280]  Oh, I'm going to throw a half down on this.
[07:42.860 --> 07:43.880]  Oh, what's this? Armour?
[07:44.120 --> 07:44.980]  Armour, max armour.
[07:45.280 --> 07:45.800]  Oh, shit.
[07:47.720 --> 07:47.960]  Woo.
[07:50.220 --> 07:51.580]  Get out of here, zombies.
[07:53.060 --> 07:56.000]  Oh, the unfortunate thing has happened where I've run out of ammo on the good gun
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.720]  and I now have to be careful not to accidentally pack a bunch of shit.
[08:00.200 --> 08:02.700]  It is dangerous.
[08:09.010 --> 08:09.550]  Thank you.
[08:09.550 --> 08:13.530]  So the once we pack a punch to the gun, Nick,
[08:13.830 --> 08:17.010]  you're going to have to be careful because it'll damage you until you drink
[08:17.010 --> 08:19.770]  this PhD flopper thing over here.
[08:20.270 --> 08:21.230]  How do we pack a punch?
[08:21.590 --> 08:23.990]  We need to get all the power up and then we'll bring it out.
[08:24.250 --> 08:24.970]  The pack punch.
[08:24.970 --> 08:26.670]  And then you run up to it and hold X.
[08:27.250 --> 08:30.890]  This is why we were excited about the other level, because you could just walk up
[08:30.890 --> 08:32.030]  to it. Oh.
[08:33.190 --> 08:35.710]  Yeah, I've seen the first two feet.
[08:37.450 --> 08:38.890]  Oh, I seem to be out of ammo.
[08:39.650 --> 08:42.410]  Right now, we got to turn on this generator over here.
[08:43.770 --> 08:46.590]  And then once we do that, we can activate the pack punch.
[08:47.470 --> 08:49.090]  Oh, double points. Nice.
[08:50.430 --> 08:51.290]  Great, Brad.
[08:52.130 --> 08:53.650]  Get ammo. Oh, not ammo.
[08:54.090 --> 08:55.990]  Oh, that's brutal. Shit.
[08:58.410 --> 09:01.350]  Bad time. Bad time.
[09:02.750 --> 09:03.470]  Terrible time.
[09:07.360 --> 09:09.940]  I'm just having to use my combat axe over and over again
[09:09.940 --> 09:10.960]  because I'm also out of ammo.
[09:13.060 --> 09:14.320]  You have a combat axe?
[09:14.540 --> 09:15.780]  Yeah. Oh, shit. Whoops.
[09:16.080 --> 09:17.680]  Whoa. OK. Nick, new hit.
[09:17.840 --> 09:18.360]  Thank you.
[09:18.780 --> 09:20.760]  Now, if only somebody had a max ammo.
[09:21.420 --> 09:23.920]  There's an ammo box in here somewhere.
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.820]  I think I found it. It's on me.
[09:27.540 --> 09:28.100]  On you? OK.
[09:28.680 --> 09:29.520]  OK, there you are.
[09:30.240 --> 09:32.020]  Let's get that ammo and then let's defend.
[09:32.880 --> 09:33.780]  I've deployed too much gears.
[09:33.860 --> 09:35.380]  I held left bumper to see where you were.
[09:35.780 --> 09:36.960]  I threw a smoke grenade.
[09:36.960 --> 09:38.060]  All right. Refilled.
[09:39.080 --> 09:41.240]  Thought you were about to tell me that you tried to active reload.
[09:42.140 --> 09:43.700]  Oh, then I put ammo in the wrong gun.
[09:43.800 --> 09:45.880]  You fricking moron. OK, turn on the generator.
[09:46.140 --> 09:46.900]  I'm just going to hold it.
[09:47.440 --> 09:48.620]  You picked the wrong gun.
[09:48.900 --> 09:51.380]  Oh, fucking flies, mosquitoes.
[09:54.140 --> 09:55.160]  Get the citronella.
[09:56.220 --> 09:56.920]  Yeah, no kidding.
[09:57.340 --> 09:58.140]  Light it up. Light it up.
[09:58.340 --> 09:59.520]  OK, put a distractor down.
[10:01.580 --> 10:02.520]  What's a distractor?
[10:02.860 --> 10:05.360]  Oh, I'm going to guess it is.
[10:07.380 --> 10:08.100]  It distracts.
[10:08.100 --> 10:08.520]  You know what?
[10:09.040 --> 10:10.360]  Context clues. I might need help.
[10:10.460 --> 10:10.900]  I might need help.
[10:11.240 --> 10:12.640]  I also might need help. I'm down.
[10:14.240 --> 10:15.500]  OK, where are you?
[10:15.600 --> 10:16.160]  Oh, there you are.
[10:17.700 --> 10:18.060]  Whoo.
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.460]  I can't believe I didn't die.
[10:23.740 --> 10:24.680]  I can't get you, Geoff.
[10:25.620 --> 10:27.100]  Yeah, we're working on it.
[10:27.480 --> 10:28.480]  Gotcha. Whoo.
[10:28.820 --> 10:30.120]  That was a lot of dick heads. OK, I'll cover.
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.440]  OK, I'm going to go activate the pack hundle.
[10:34.140 --> 10:35.340]  Oh, oh, Gavin's down.
[10:40.040 --> 10:41.220]  All right, coming for you, bud.
[10:41.880 --> 10:42.880]  All right, I'll cover you, Geoff.
[10:43.280 --> 10:45.760]  OK, lift is coming up and it has the pack a bunch on it.
[10:46.740 --> 10:48.560]  Hell yeah. Oh, sweet.
[10:48.960 --> 10:50.540]  Can I afford it? Hell yes, I can.
[10:54.580 --> 10:55.300]  So be careful.
[10:55.440 --> 10:58.140]  One side is the lift controls and the other side is the pack.
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.560]  OK, so use the pistol on the pack a bunch.
[11:01.780 --> 11:02.740]  If you have $5,000.
[11:03.120 --> 11:04.540]  Do you have $5,000? I do.
[11:05.100 --> 11:07.400]  OK, but be careful, Nick, because it will damage yourself
[11:07.400 --> 11:08.740]  until you buy that drink, as I said.
[11:08.740 --> 11:10.080]  Where's the drink? All right.
[11:10.180 --> 11:11.420]  And where is it in the caves?
[11:11.940 --> 11:13.440]  It's two thousand five hundred.
[11:13.920 --> 11:15.500]  Yeah, shit. Where do I go?
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.180]  You guys leave and I'm still heading back to the caves.
[11:19.140 --> 11:20.580]  Yeah, well, we'll go together.
[11:20.820 --> 11:22.220]  I'm going to stay in this room
[11:22.220 --> 11:24.700]  because it's sort of circular and run around more easily.
[11:26.220 --> 11:26.760]  Like I need.
[11:26.900 --> 11:28.320]  I don't have twenty five hundred bucks to.
[11:28.820 --> 11:29.920]  Yeah, I need the juice.
[11:32.640 --> 11:33.980]  I don't even have the.
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.080]  The punch yet.
[11:36.800 --> 11:37.420]  All right.
[11:39.540 --> 11:40.460]  Yeah, but you're good.
[11:40.660 --> 11:41.600]  I'm not worried about you.
[11:41.720 --> 11:42.160]  You're Andrew.
[11:42.600 --> 11:44.520]  Oh yeah, you got it.
[11:47.240 --> 11:48.940]  Let me punch it, let me punch it.
[11:51.740 --> 11:52.460]  Nice points.
[11:52.860 --> 11:53.160]  Oh yeah.
[11:54.120 --> 11:55.760]  Oh, Gavin, you can get this now.
[11:56.420 --> 11:56.840]  Is the.
[11:57.820 --> 11:58.780]  Lead me to the juice.
[11:58.980 --> 12:00.040]  Almost enough for the juice.
[12:00.160 --> 12:02.100]  Maybe I'll get it when we're by the time we get there.
[12:02.460 --> 12:03.240]  Where's the juice at?
[12:03.380 --> 12:04.320]  I'm back in the caves.
[12:04.900 --> 12:05.840]  Yeah, also in the caves.
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.780]  It's to the at the top at the right.
[12:07.900 --> 12:08.720]  You can see it on the mini map.
[12:08.800 --> 12:08.960]  Oh, yeah.
[12:08.980 --> 12:10.980]  It's like the purple new fudge flopper.
[12:12.100 --> 12:12.980]  Not quite there yet.
[12:12.980 --> 12:13.440]  Got it.
[12:13.680 --> 12:14.260]  I'll get it in a second.
[12:14.400 --> 12:16.420]  What? Where do you increase your rarity?
[12:16.700 --> 12:17.600]  Is that around here, too?
[12:17.820 --> 12:20.520]  Yeah, that is in the as soon as you go into the room.
[12:21.760 --> 12:22.940]  It's a good call, Geoff.
[12:23.520 --> 12:24.820]  Great. We're going with the rarity thing.
[12:25.760 --> 12:26.020]  All right.
[12:26.120 --> 12:30.980]  I'm so use your scraps, Nick, to upgrade your gun rarity.
[12:31.320 --> 12:33.400]  I don't think you can because you bought it from the wall.
[12:33.400 --> 12:37.680]  Currently, once you get a thousand scrap, you can make it blue
[12:37.680 --> 12:38.500]  and it'll do more damage.
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.700]  Insta kill. Nice.
[12:44.420 --> 12:48.120]  All right, I got my flopper juice heading back to the room.
[12:48.300 --> 12:50.500]  I'm down to one armor plate or I'm not armor.
[12:50.600 --> 12:53.360]  Actually, is this the thing that I can upgrade?
[12:54.220 --> 12:55.420]  Yeah, sure is.
[12:55.820 --> 12:56.000]  Yeah.
[12:59.780 --> 13:00.620]  Not worried.
[13:01.240 --> 13:04.500]  It looks like I can upgrade to
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.720]  I got my wire for Sally, but that's it.
[13:08.860 --> 13:09.900]  They do that or do what?
[13:09.940 --> 13:12.100]  Sorry, the dead wire for Sally.
[13:12.220 --> 13:14.600]  It's bullets deal electric damage.
[13:14.740 --> 13:15.380]  Oh, you can if you want.
[13:15.400 --> 13:17.480]  But the weapon rarity is going to be more useful to you.
[13:17.520 --> 13:19.500]  You have the right bumper, right bumper.
[13:19.620 --> 13:22.020]  Oh, OK. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.
[13:22.020 --> 13:23.080]  Got it. Nice.
[13:25.500 --> 13:27.260]  I didn't realize there was a second tab.
[13:28.000 --> 13:28.700]  Damn bumpers.
[13:28.700 --> 13:30.580]  All right.
[13:31.220 --> 13:33.920]  Well, now we're getting that salvage.
[13:34.540 --> 13:37.820]  You know, I was thinking there's that Sam terminal on the other map.
[13:37.940 --> 13:41.980]  When I was playing this a lot with Bernie and Antonio, we would do those constantly.
[13:42.180 --> 13:43.700]  And that's how you would get the wonder weapons.
[13:44.680 --> 13:46.260]  Yeah, some wonder weapons.
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.140]  Yeah, I feel so lost coming in to zombies so late.
[13:52.720 --> 13:55.720]  I just remember you would do like more and more and more of them to get like
[13:55.720 --> 13:58.440]  better rewards and the rewards were like
[14:00.280 --> 14:02.020]  all the top tier guns and shit.
[14:06.090 --> 14:09.610]  But then again, I feel like every zombies map is a different flavor.
[14:10.890 --> 14:11.790]  Slightly different mechanic.
[14:13.190 --> 14:13.390]  Yeah.
[14:14.510 --> 14:18.550]  I think it's good for like getting drops or I don't even know
[14:18.550 --> 14:21.350]  what you call it, like a kill streak perk. Hmm.
[14:21.850 --> 14:24.950]  And you can get some like money and salvage from it.
[14:24.950 --> 14:28.350]  But I don't know if it has like the
[14:28.930 --> 14:30.730]  suck gun we were using on the other level.
[14:31.130 --> 14:32.650]  Yeah. Oh, there's now.
[14:32.730 --> 14:36.370]  Do I buy ammo or do I wait for the inevitable max ammo drop?
[14:36.430 --> 14:37.390]  A constant dilemma.
[14:39.870 --> 14:43.490]  Does it charge you based on how much ammo it charges you based
[14:43.490 --> 14:44.930]  on how powerful your weapon is?
[14:45.830 --> 14:47.870]  Oh, so it gets pretty expensive toward the end.
[14:49.770 --> 14:51.310]  Oh, dude, you got your two, huh?
[14:51.450 --> 14:53.310]  That's awesome. Oh, let's go it up.
[14:54.630 --> 14:57.590]  Oh, oh, oh, I'm done with this room.
[14:57.770 --> 14:58.290]  Oh, shit.
[15:00.030 --> 15:02.210]  I like that. Did we did we do that or did it?
[15:02.210 --> 15:04.010]  No, just it does that every once in a while.
[15:04.030 --> 15:04.890]  It'll go up and down.
[15:05.570 --> 15:07.910]  Oh, OK. Oh, and we need to be on it.
[15:08.430 --> 15:09.330]  No, we don't have to.
[15:09.830 --> 15:11.890]  But we all are not on it. Are we trapped?
[15:12.130 --> 15:13.570]  No, we can just go off the way we came.
[15:13.710 --> 15:15.850]  My came up in front of my legs.
[15:17.110 --> 15:17.550]  That's funny.
[15:18.930 --> 15:22.250]  OK, I mean, we might as well just open up the rest of the map and all that stuff.
[15:22.250 --> 15:24.690]  So it's fine to be up here.
[15:25.190 --> 15:30.210]  It's also a pretty good area over here to kite them using this like long ramp.
[15:32.410 --> 15:33.730]  Hmm. Good call.
[15:34.150 --> 15:35.190]  Oh, Nick, you're in the shit there.
[15:35.710 --> 15:38.250]  Oh, yeah. Oh, there's an armor or something.
[15:38.390 --> 15:38.570]  Yeah.
[15:39.690 --> 15:40.430]  Oh, I'm up top.
[15:43.270 --> 15:44.250]  There's a door up here.
[15:45.910 --> 15:47.130]  And I'm out of ammo. Shit.
[15:47.510 --> 15:48.710]  There's ammo right now. Right on me, guys.
[15:50.270 --> 15:50.990]  Max armor.
[15:53.450 --> 15:54.170]  Ooh, salvage.
[15:54.730 --> 15:55.350]  Thank you.
[15:57.410 --> 15:58.430]  It's time to buy some ammo.
[15:59.410 --> 16:00.850]  All right. 21 levels to go.
[16:02.990 --> 16:07.970]  We'll have to at some point try to do the actual like Easter egg campaign for this.
[16:08.070 --> 16:08.990]  It is wild.
[16:09.610 --> 16:11.170]  It is. I've been doing boss fight.
[16:11.850 --> 16:15.570]  I've been doing a run on the other map where I get pack a punch, get to level 11
[16:15.570 --> 16:18.670]  and then just X fill and get the XP for it to try to level my gun up.
[16:18.710 --> 16:20.050]  It's been a lot of fun, but I'd like to.
[16:20.970 --> 16:23.490]  I'd like to really explore the Easter egg.
[16:25.910 --> 16:27.150]  Hey, where are they at?
[16:27.430 --> 16:28.050]  Where are they hiding?
[16:28.150 --> 16:28.470]  Oh, shit.
[16:28.750 --> 16:30.970]  Oh, is that one of us?
[16:31.250 --> 16:32.570]  What the fuck was that?
[16:32.930 --> 16:36.210]  Either one of you guys spooked me or a zombie just like blew up in my face.
[16:36.450 --> 16:37.130]  One of the two.
[16:37.310 --> 16:38.950]  Oh, I shot a zombie behind you, I think.
[16:39.050 --> 16:41.530]  That, yeah, that scared the shit out of me.
[16:41.810 --> 16:43.650]  Oh, zombie shit.
[16:44.550 --> 16:45.430]  Oh, shit. Look at this.
[16:46.670 --> 16:48.250]  A million of them.
[16:48.350 --> 16:49.130]  Oh, times two.
[16:49.130 --> 16:51.550]  Oh, I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a.
[16:51.550 --> 16:54.510]  Get the max ammo for the fucking Christ's sake, please.
[16:54.710 --> 16:55.990]  Oh, good grab.
[16:58.870 --> 17:01.710]  Maybe next time we get a Sam trial, do we have one on the map?
[17:01.870 --> 17:02.630]  I don't think we do.
[17:03.110 --> 17:05.610]  No, not currently. Next time it pops up, we can go do it.
[17:05.970 --> 17:06.830]  At least try to.
[17:10.370 --> 17:13.290]  So the goal with this is just to make it 31 days and then go home.
[17:14.030 --> 17:15.350]  Sure. Yeah, we can try to X-Fill.
[17:16.670 --> 17:18.490]  Or what did you want to do? Just make it 31?
[17:18.490 --> 17:20.210]  Yeah, just try to at least hit 31.
[17:20.310 --> 17:22.770]  But I'm good with X-Filling after that if we want to try that.
[17:23.670 --> 17:26.010]  What's the significance of 31 just because it's a month thing?
[17:26.230 --> 17:26.610]  Yeah. Yeah.
[17:27.490 --> 17:31.190]  We did 31 dogs, 31 cream, 31 waves.
[17:31.930 --> 17:34.650]  Do you see somebody posted on Reddit that there's a restaurant in their town
[17:34.650 --> 17:35.510]  called Dog and Cream?
[17:35.930 --> 17:37.610]  Oh, God, really? No way.
[17:37.610 --> 17:39.850]  Yeah, it's the most unappetizing name for a restaurant ever.
[17:39.870 --> 17:41.670]  It really is. Exactly what we had.
[17:42.010 --> 17:43.890]  It's us. It's just hot dogs and ice cream.
[17:44.490 --> 17:45.170]  Oh, really?
[17:45.170 --> 17:50.970]  I would want that to be like an adopt-a-dog center that does like tea.
[17:51.470 --> 17:54.150]  Oh, I'm getting hammered.
[17:55.410 --> 17:58.070]  Because they don't really do dog cafes, do they?
[17:58.590 --> 18:00.010]  I only hear of cat cafes.
[18:00.370 --> 18:02.990]  Yeah, you have cat cafes and rabbit... they have bunny cafes now.
[18:03.950 --> 18:05.150]  You're like, bunny? Really?
[18:05.150 --> 18:06.330]  That's a moral liability there.
[18:08.410 --> 18:10.290]  Well, in your perspective, maybe.
[18:10.630 --> 18:11.530]  Ah, ammo. Free ammo.
[18:12.750 --> 18:16.830]  I can't imagine a cat cafe filled with Smee's. It's just terrible.
[18:17.170 --> 18:17.250]  Oh, yeah.
[18:17.830 --> 18:20.130]  Oh, is that machine over here? I'm going to upgrade my gun again.
[18:21.610 --> 18:24.010]  Oh, yeah, we do that. I've never used this one.
[18:24.590 --> 18:25.170]  There we go.
[18:26.230 --> 18:27.150]  I'm going to do the same.
[18:27.930 --> 18:28.450]  It's rarer.
[18:29.970 --> 18:31.830]  Did you already have 2,500 salvage?
[18:32.490 --> 18:33.250]  Oh, I don't yet.
[18:33.390 --> 18:34.850]  I had 1,000 is what I needed.
[18:36.730 --> 18:37.530]  Ow, shit.
[18:38.490 --> 18:38.870]  Insta-kill.
[18:39.730 --> 18:40.530]  Insta-kill.
[18:42.850 --> 18:45.350]  I have noticed, Nick, if you're... oh, uh, Mangler.
[18:46.630 --> 18:53.270]  If you're looking for more plates, Nick, the armored zombies seem to have a higher frequency of dropping them.
[18:53.390 --> 18:54.370]  Oh, Gavin is down.
[18:54.410 --> 18:54.890]  Coming for you.
[18:55.130 --> 18:56.150]  I got hit by Mangle.
[18:56.490 --> 19:04.030]  So, a thing to remember as well, Nick, is that if you go down, you're going to lose your soda, so Gavin has to go buy it again.
[19:04.890 --> 19:07.210]  It gets very expensive to go down.
[19:08.410 --> 19:10.050]  Avoid the nuke as well.
[19:11.710 --> 19:15.050]  Until we're at, like, the end, so we can maximize the money we get.
[19:15.390 --> 19:15.950]  I think we're at the end.
[19:16.590 --> 19:18.570]  Because the nuke cheaps you out on the money.
[19:19.510 --> 19:19.950]  On the kills.
[19:20.330 --> 19:20.490]  Yeah.
[19:21.110 --> 19:21.730]  Yeah, I popped it.
[19:21.870 --> 19:22.970]  Oh, there's a Sam trial right here.
[19:24.030 --> 19:24.770]  I'm going to pop this.
[19:25.510 --> 19:27.310]  How do I get back downstairs to get the...
[19:28.190 --> 19:28.910]  What's this thing do?
[19:30.570 --> 19:32.190]  Kill in the location of the Sam trial.
[19:32.370 --> 19:32.530]  Okay.
[19:33.610 --> 19:34.130]  Oh, alright.
[19:35.050 --> 19:36.970]  Is there an upstairs fledge flop?
[19:39.330 --> 19:39.730]  No.
[19:41.290 --> 19:42.850]  You have to go the way that we came down.
[19:43.830 --> 19:47.190]  Does it count if we kill them outside of this, but we're in it?
[19:47.430 --> 19:47.610]  Okay.
[19:49.210 --> 19:50.070]  I believe so.
[19:50.210 --> 19:51.010]  Maybe not, actually.
[19:52.210 --> 19:53.610]  Yeah, it's a...
[19:54.090 --> 19:55.530]  It's appearing to be no.
[19:56.430 --> 19:57.390]  What was that big dude?
[19:57.510 --> 19:59.350]  Do we just have to kill them in this zone?
[19:59.490 --> 20:00.010]  I think so.
[20:00.670 --> 20:03.130]  But I don't think you have to be in the zone, just the zombies do.
[20:03.470 --> 20:03.790]  Oh.
[20:04.350 --> 20:05.650]  I think we have to be in the zone.
[20:05.810 --> 20:06.230]  Oh, do we?
[20:06.430 --> 20:07.790]  I think so, but I don't know.
[20:08.650 --> 20:10.030]  There's an extra body over there if anybody gets it.
[20:12.850 --> 20:12.990]  Oh!
[20:16.800 --> 20:20.080]  I mean, you're getting a shit ton of salvo, regardless of how this ultimately goes.
[20:20.080 --> 20:21.340]  What was that? Oh, max armor. Nice.
[20:23.620 --> 20:25.380]  77. Oh, we're doing great.
[20:27.140 --> 20:28.580]  Oh boy. Okay, I'm out of ammo now.
[20:29.740 --> 20:31.000]  There's ammo in the room.
[20:32.280 --> 20:33.340]  Oh, there's loads of scrap.
[20:33.360 --> 20:33.760]  You get it.
[20:33.760 --> 20:34.580]  Oh!
[20:37.180 --> 20:39.120]  Scrap, scrap, scrap, scrap, scrap, scrap, scrap, scrap.
[20:39.760 --> 20:40.240]  Scrip.
[20:41.100 --> 20:41.380]  Scrip!

[21:03.700 --> 21:04.100]  Oh.
[21:05.760 --> 21:09.240]  I think it might have pack-a-punched my gun. Oh, you got a pack-a-punch out of that?
[21:10.100 --> 21:15.580]  I got a purple with crystal and now my gun is orange instead of green. Fuck yeah, that might you might be a max punch
[21:15.580 --> 21:21.160]  I got a ray gun wonder weapon. Oh, dude. You got a wonder weapon? You got a ray gun?

[21:29.800 --> 21:33.580]  I think like everything is a one-shot kill with it essentially. Oh shit

[21:39.640 --> 21:40.440]  That's crazy

[22:44.820 --> 22:46.780]  Depends on if the lift has dropped down

[30:31.900 --> 30:33.400]  What is a special attack?
[30:33.400 --> 30:39.320]  It's if you hit both bumpers if anybody's close to going down, let me know I still have my group heal

[45:35.850 --> 45:38.170]  How does this map feel compared to the other one?
[45:39.550 --> 45:42.010]  I think it's just as good once you know what you're doing.
[45:42.870 --> 45:44.350]  It might be easier.
[45:44.950 --> 45:49.070]  Really? It also might just be that we are

[45:53.470 --> 45:56.290]  Oh, fuck. I've got no ammo. This is real bad.
[45:57.410 --> 45:58.930]  We can make our way back to the lab.
[46:00.370 --> 46:07.550]  Oh, fuck. Where are you? There you are. Oh fuck. I just gotta go. I'm sorry. I don't have any ammo. I can't. Oh shit.

[46:14.430 --> 46:17.730]  You got that little super, right? This might be it for us.
[46:19.570 --> 46:20.230]  What's this?
[46:21.130 --> 46:22.410]  Oh shit, that's not good.
[46:22.970 --> 46:23.890]  Us. There you go.
[46:24.790 --> 46:26.390]  Alright, get Gavin first, of course.
[46:26.510 --> 46:28.650]  He's closer to death. I'm sorry, I'm already on you.
[46:28.790 --> 46:29.450]  Oh shit, I'm down.
[46:30.690 --> 46:34.810]  Alright, Mangler. Mangler's down.
[46:37.090 --> 46:38.050]  Oh my god.
[46:38.250 --> 46:40.890]  It's a kill, it's a kill. It's a nuke, it's a nuke!
[46:41.250 --> 46:42.190]  Get to the insta-kill.
[46:42.910 --> 46:43.150]  Yeah!
[46:43.930 --> 46:45.270]  Go for Gavin, go for Gavin, go for Gavin!
[46:45.270 --> 46:45.350]  Go Gavin!
[46:46.250 --> 46:47.050]  Gavin's down.
[46:47.830 --> 46:50.110]  Oh, my ray gun.
[46:50.730 --> 46:51.190]  Fuck off.
[46:53.810 --> 46:54.410]  Okay.
[46:55.530 --> 46:56.350]  Alright, let's...
[46:56.350 --> 46:58.350]  Pull your back, Gavin. You're just gonna be at a huge disadvantage.
[46:59.350 --> 47:00.910]  Yeah. Oh my god.
[47:01.250 --> 47:01.870]  Turret down.
[47:02.290 --> 47:04.170]  If anyone wants it, over here.
[47:04.910 --> 47:05.710]  I've got fists.
[47:07.790 --> 47:08.390]  Uh...
[47:08.390 --> 47:10.310]  Are they really, really, really strong fists?
[47:11.450 --> 47:11.950]  No.
[47:11.950 --> 47:13.210]  Oh no.
[47:14.970 --> 47:15.850]  Oh boy.
[47:15.930 --> 47:17.170]  This is gonna be so bad.
[47:17.290 --> 47:19.050]  We gotta get out of here. This is a death trap.
[47:19.330 --> 47:20.790]  It's way too confined.
[47:21.350 --> 47:23.530]  Into the thick of it.
[47:24.090 --> 47:25.770]  I think my gun's shooting flower petals.
[47:28.550 --> 47:30.310]  That is not gonna help.
[47:32.570 --> 47:34.730]  It takes like a whole clip to do one zombie.
[47:34.830 --> 47:35.930]  Oh my god, it's terrible.
[47:36.610 --> 47:37.410]  It's terrible.
[47:39.230 --> 47:40.170]  Oh my god.
[47:40.170 --> 47:41.450]  I need ammo so bad.
[47:41.990 --> 47:42.950]  Always need ammo.
[47:43.370 --> 47:44.270]  We can make a run to it.
[47:44.830 --> 47:45.790]  Oh, you did.
[47:48.510 --> 47:49.630]  Oh, what the Christ?
[47:50.910 --> 47:51.810]  Oh, that's bullshit.
[47:52.370 --> 47:54.630]  Every direction is bad.
[47:57.910 --> 47:59.110]  I'm getting you, Nick.
[48:00.090 --> 48:00.470]  Alright.
[48:01.270 --> 48:01.990]  Remember, juice.
[48:02.650 --> 48:04.530]  I need to get the juice here in a second.
[48:04.710 --> 48:05.170]  Oh, perfect.
[48:05.690 --> 48:06.430]  Oh, lol.
[48:09.110 --> 48:09.550]  Plate.
[48:10.490 --> 48:12.470]  Where was that gun? Where do we buy it?
[48:12.690 --> 48:14.810]  At the start. We gotta go back to the starting area.
[48:15.310 --> 48:16.810]  Oh my god.
[48:17.190 --> 48:17.770]  Gavin, here, follow me.
[48:18.250 --> 48:19.890]  I've actually never used this.
[48:20.390 --> 48:21.810]  Following you.
[48:23.430 --> 48:25.130]  There's an elevator in here
[48:25.130 --> 48:26.350]  we can use, I believe.
[48:27.910 --> 48:28.710]  Where is it?
[48:30.190 --> 48:31.890]  It's somewhere by Geoff, maybe?
[48:32.370 --> 48:33.130]  Hello, I'm Geoff.
[48:35.350 --> 48:36.690]  Where the fuck is this elevator?
[48:36.690 --> 48:37.110]  Oh, no!
[48:38.490 --> 48:39.670]  You're okay, you're just swimming.
[48:40.030 --> 48:40.690]  You're just taking a dip.
[48:42.030 --> 48:44.430]  Oh, dip in the pool?
[48:45.990 --> 48:46.710]  That's not...
[48:47.270 --> 48:48.710]  Oh, I'm out of ammo. That's bad.
[48:49.270 --> 48:49.890]  That is bad.
[48:50.170 --> 48:50.770]  Back to the water.
[48:55.320 --> 48:56.120]  Oh, this elevator?
[48:57.680 --> 48:59.300]  If you're in an elevator, take it up.
[48:59.960 --> 49:00.760]  Oh, sorry, Geoff.
[49:01.100 --> 49:01.840]  That's okay.
[49:03.860 --> 49:04.760]  Bonked my head.
[49:09.710 --> 49:10.510]  Oh, I'm in the jail.
[49:11.690 --> 49:13.790]  And it should be on the wall, if you afford.
[49:14.850 --> 49:15.410]  Holy shit.
[49:17.970 --> 49:18.570]  Oh, man.
[49:18.670 --> 49:21.490]  I'm gonna try to run up to you, because you're gonna...
[49:21.490 --> 49:23.230]  You're gonna be by yourself, which sucks.
[49:23.890 --> 49:25.110]  God bless America.
[49:27.670 --> 49:29.370]  Geoff, can you get Nick, or do you want me to come back?
[49:29.890 --> 49:31.410]  Uh, I can't. I'm out of ammo.
[49:31.550 --> 49:32.550]  Hold on, let me get ammo.
[49:33.010 --> 49:33.570]  It's down by me.
[49:33.570 --> 49:35.570]  Going back, going back.
[49:35.570 --> 49:39.010]  Alright, Nick, I'm headed for you.
[49:40.350 --> 49:41.390]  I'm gonna get Nick, don't worry.
[49:43.490 --> 49:45.330]  Nick was crawling away from you.
[49:47.690 --> 49:48.690]  Just let me die.
[49:49.370 --> 49:51.910]  Okay, we got one zombie, if we want to just keep him alive for now.
[49:52.050 --> 49:53.410]  Yeah, you should definitely...
[49:53.410 --> 49:54.430]  Definitely run around.
[49:55.250 --> 49:57.090]  Oh, my God. I'm gonna go...
[49:57.090 --> 50:00.270]  Oh, I need, like, 700 bucks to pack a punch again.
[50:00.450 --> 50:01.390]  Oh, I need the juice, too.
[50:01.390 --> 50:02.530]  You don't need ammo.
[50:03.550 --> 50:04.930]  Uh, I'd rather be full.
[50:05.410 --> 50:07.530]  Okay. You're good. You're doing it.
[50:07.950 --> 50:09.330]  Where is the elevator?
[50:09.490 --> 50:10.410]  It's not here. Okay.
[50:11.930 --> 50:13.110]  Oh, I do. Thank God.
[50:13.430 --> 50:14.410]  Alright, sewed it up.
[50:15.210 --> 50:16.970]  What's the fastest way to the juice from here?
[50:18.130 --> 50:19.270]  You're going to it.
[50:19.590 --> 50:21.270]  The other way. Turn...
[50:21.270 --> 50:24.970]  Into that lab in here, and then just go straight and down into the caves.
[50:25.410 --> 50:26.230]  Down here, Gavin!
[50:26.970 --> 50:30.550]  I got a key. I'm gonna go open one of those...
[50:30.550 --> 50:31.930]  Oh, I got a key, too.
[50:32.510 --> 50:33.870]  Oh, yeah.
[50:35.210 --> 50:36.330]  Thanks for mocking it.
[50:37.290 --> 50:37.930]  You're welcome.
[50:39.510 --> 50:41.050]  Wow, it kind of sucks at level 2.
[50:43.490 --> 50:44.530]  Oh, no. We got a new level.
[50:44.990 --> 50:45.390]  27.
[50:46.450 --> 50:47.890]  I'll wait for Gavin. Here we go.
[50:50.410 --> 50:51.830]  I'm not anywhere near y'all.
[50:52.350 --> 50:53.250]  I got gobble gum.
[50:54.570 --> 50:55.750]  Let's gobble. Thanks, Nick.
[50:56.310 --> 50:56.710]  Let's go.
[50:56.710 --> 50:58.930]  I need to pack-a-punch my dick right off.
[50:58.930 --> 51:00.130]  If you want in the room, Geoff.
[51:01.050 --> 51:01.850]  In a what?
[51:03.490 --> 51:05.290]  He's gotta punch his dick off, dawg.
[51:07.310 --> 51:08.670]  Oh, okay. Yeah.
[51:08.930 --> 51:09.990]  How does this work? I haven't done this yet.
[51:10.310 --> 51:10.770]  Oh!
[51:14.470 --> 51:15.690]  Alright, in the armory.
[51:16.070 --> 51:17.450]  Does anybody want a rocket launcher?
[51:18.610 --> 51:19.530]  Sigma 2B?
[51:20.430 --> 51:21.990]  Ooh, nice.
[51:23.570 --> 51:24.710]  You already got three.
[51:24.710 --> 51:25.710]  You got three.
[51:26.310 --> 51:28.230]  There's a zombie in the room with me.
[51:28.630 --> 51:29.050]  Oh, really?
[51:30.450 --> 51:31.170]  That's funny.
[51:32.350 --> 51:36.770]  Yeah, I've never seen that. That's wild.
[51:38.650 --> 51:40.190]  God, I hate those parasites.
[51:43.790 --> 51:44.250]  Oh, front door!
[51:44.710 --> 51:44.810]  Ah!
[51:50.030 --> 51:50.510]  28.
[51:52.250 --> 51:52.610]  28?
[51:54.810 --> 51:55.170]  Okay.
[51:57.390 --> 51:58.570]  Luckily, we funneled those
[51:58.570 --> 52:00.390]  stupid parasites in that one spot.
[52:00.510 --> 52:01.170]  Yeah, that was great.
[52:02.050 --> 52:03.970]  I'm just gonna hang about, buy the pack-a-punch,
[52:04.130 --> 52:05.990]  because I need to buy it as soon as I can afford it.
[52:06.010 --> 52:07.890]  Oh, I did it again. I keep activating that thing.
[52:08.370 --> 52:09.150]  Oh, no!
[52:10.690 --> 52:11.090]  Geoff, why?
[52:11.550 --> 52:12.350]  I didn't mean to.
[52:13.530 --> 52:15.050]  What were you trying to do?
[52:15.410 --> 52:17.330]  I was trying to do the rarity on my gun.
[52:17.330 --> 52:18.970]  I thought, it's not this machine,
[52:19.070 --> 52:19.730]  it's the other machine.
[52:21.250 --> 52:22.290]  It looks like it.
[52:22.330 --> 52:25.670]  It just got so insane.
[52:25.990 --> 52:27.470]  Nick, use your cool move.
[52:28.690 --> 52:29.590]  Yeah, I'm down.
[52:29.910 --> 52:30.550]  Oh, my God.
[52:30.830 --> 52:31.110]  I'm coming for you.
[52:31.870 --> 52:33.590]  Oh, God.
[52:34.250 --> 52:35.850]  You're good, you got it!
[52:36.510 --> 52:37.850]  Get up and run!
[52:39.510 --> 52:39.710]  Woo!
[52:43.660 --> 52:44.720]  Oh, my God.
[52:46.360 --> 52:46.780]  Oh, shit.
[52:48.700 --> 52:49.080]  You alright?
[52:49.420 --> 52:49.580]  Yeah.
[52:52.400 --> 52:54.040]  I just gotta get this pack-a-punch.
[52:59.100 --> 53:00.140]  Watch that ammo, Nick.
[53:00.480 --> 53:02.000]  You're okay, just keep an eye.
[53:02.060 --> 53:03.520]  Oh, okay, yeah. Good call, thank you.
[53:04.160 --> 53:04.420]  Woo!
[53:05.280 --> 53:06.440]  Big time, Mangler.
[53:07.100 --> 53:09.180]  Oh, no, I'm down. Fuck, I'm sorry.
[53:09.640 --> 53:11.700]  I went down getting up a rarity.
[53:13.060 --> 53:13.520]  That's a Mangler.
[53:15.100 --> 53:16.200]  I'm going after Geoff.
[53:16.260 --> 53:16.460]  What?
[53:16.980 --> 53:17.760]  Where'd Andrew go?
[53:18.440 --> 53:19.300]  I'm behind you.
[53:20.640 --> 53:22.360]  I killed the Mangler, is what I said.
[53:22.740 --> 53:23.880]  And not that I'm down, sorry.
[53:24.040 --> 53:24.500]  Oh, sorry.
[53:26.640 --> 53:27.400]  That was, uh...
[53:27.980 --> 53:29.840]  Dude, that was some Nick behavior.
[53:30.100 --> 53:30.520]  What are you doing?
[53:32.500 --> 53:34.280]  I've been relatively behaved this video.
[53:34.400 --> 53:35.000]  You have.
[53:35.940 --> 53:36.880]  Oh, my God.
[53:38.400 --> 53:40.060]  I'm trying to get there.
[53:40.080 --> 53:41.180]  Kill the things next to us, Geoff!
[53:42.280 --> 53:43.500]  Gonna put my super down.
[53:45.700 --> 53:47.520]  There you go.
[53:47.860 --> 53:48.580]  Getting ya.
[53:50.020 --> 53:50.540]  I'm coming for Gavin.
[53:51.420 --> 53:52.920]  Oh, shit, I shouldn't have done that.
[53:54.460 --> 53:55.240]  Oh, my God.
[53:55.640 --> 53:56.680]  That was brutal.
[53:57.180 --> 53:58.760]  Jesus Christ.
[54:02.200 --> 54:02.940]  Get Nick up.
[54:03.440 --> 54:04.560]  Insta-killing, insta-killing.
[54:05.360 --> 54:06.780]  Oh, that's wonderful.
[54:07.520 --> 54:08.020]  Go for juice.
[54:09.660 --> 54:10.640]  Bowling for juice.
[54:14.440 --> 54:15.240]  Holy fuck.
[54:15.320 --> 54:17.400]  Drink up, fellas. It might be the last one.
[54:17.540 --> 54:18.660]  Oh, my God.
[54:19.060 --> 54:21.120]  Max raritied my gun, at least.
[54:23.100 --> 54:26.140]  Remember how easy this felt just like five waves ago?
[54:26.680 --> 54:27.760]  It was easy until Geoff said,
[54:27.820 --> 54:28.260]  it's so easy.
[54:28.400 --> 54:31.600]  Now, that is true. He did say that, and then we got into this.
[54:31.680 --> 54:32.900]  I don't know if that's connected.
[54:33.100 --> 54:33.760]  I'm just, you know.
[54:34.640 --> 54:36.480]  I'll take the heat for that. I know better.
[54:36.480 --> 54:37.220]  Uh-huh.
[54:40.460 --> 54:42.220]  Hey, I got a... Oh, I went down.
[54:42.320 --> 54:43.720]  How did I go down? I'm at the door.
[54:45.080 --> 54:45.780]  That's how you did.
[54:50.480 --> 54:52.480]  If you say it, it doesn't happen like I did.
[54:52.600 --> 54:53.840]  I can get more juice now.
[54:54.920 --> 54:55.600]  Oh, no.
[54:56.180 --> 54:56.540]  Mangler.
[54:59.060 --> 54:59.700]  Mangler, where?
[55:00.800 --> 55:01.780]  Did you get the juice, Geoff?
[55:01.940 --> 55:04.880]  No, there's a juice.
[55:04.880 --> 55:05.640]  I'll cover you.
[55:06.260 --> 55:07.360]  There's a juice mangler.
[55:11.580 --> 55:12.420]  We did it.
[55:12.540 --> 55:13.560]  Do you want to relocate?
[55:14.660 --> 55:14.960]  Yeah.
[55:16.120 --> 55:16.800]  Follow me.
[55:18.720 --> 55:19.820]  On me, quick, quick.
[55:20.900 --> 55:21.420]  I'm on you.
[55:24.580 --> 55:25.380]  Following Nick.
[55:25.840 --> 55:26.580]  Get over here.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.140]  Oh, a boat. There's a boat.
[55:28.280 --> 55:29.700]  Hop in the boat. Hop in the boat.
[55:29.880 --> 55:32.400]  Do I enter it?
[55:32.400 --> 55:33.900]  Hop in the boat to stand in it.
[55:34.380 --> 55:36.320]  I just want to make sure I'm getting in it.
[55:36.480 --> 55:36.980]  Drive, drive.
[55:38.440 --> 55:39.140]  It's me.
[55:39.860 --> 55:40.960]  Oh, we can drive. It's sick.
[55:41.480 --> 55:41.980]  Who's driving?
[55:43.320 --> 55:45.460]  Is there an ammo crate on it?
[55:45.960 --> 55:48.420]  No, but there's an ammo crate on this island.
[55:48.780 --> 55:50.180]  Are we just moving or are we getting off?
[55:50.840 --> 55:51.920]  Let's get off somewhere.
[55:52.680 --> 55:53.340]  Get off here.
[55:54.460 --> 55:55.160]  Where's Geoff?
[55:55.680 --> 55:56.160]  I'm on the boat.
[55:57.180 --> 55:58.400]  Oh, zombies live here.
[55:58.400 --> 55:59.840]  Yeah, they spawn in as well.
[56:00.620 --> 56:02.800]  You landed us on zombie island.
[56:06.180 --> 56:07.320]  What do they have?
[56:08.680 --> 56:09.120]  Amalgam?
[56:12.640 --> 56:13.300]  It's down.
[56:13.940 --> 56:15.300]  It's dead. I don't think you're down.
[56:17.080 --> 56:18.120]  There's ammo on the island.
[56:18.580 --> 56:19.020]  I'm out of ammo.
[56:19.760 --> 56:21.460]  There's ammo on the island.
[56:22.000 --> 56:22.540]  I'm down.
[56:23.540 --> 56:24.680]  Well, there's ammo on the island.
[56:29.560 --> 56:30.840]  This is much worse.
[56:32.080 --> 56:33.600]  This is much worse.
[56:33.760 --> 56:36.180]  It's not exactly as easy as...
[56:41.780 --> 56:42.660]  Fuck me.
[56:43.160 --> 56:44.440]  Okay, trying to get to you.
[56:45.800 --> 56:48.860]  Okay, well, we should probably actually go back to the melee
[56:48.860 --> 56:50.160]  because we need the juice now.
[56:50.680 --> 56:51.300]  Yeah, let's juice.
[56:52.320 --> 56:53.280]  Back to the boat.
[56:55.060 --> 56:56.320]  Ping it. Can you ping the boat?
[56:56.320 --> 56:57.240]  Just come to me.
[56:57.880 --> 56:58.600]  Alright.
[57:01.480 --> 57:03.600]  Eventually a gas cloud
[57:04.320 --> 57:05.640]  comes over.
[57:07.040 --> 57:08.160]  Go back to shore.
[57:18.520 --> 57:20.880]  That's how Dawn of the Dead remake ended.
[57:20.880 --> 57:22.620]  That was a dog shit island.
[57:25.220 --> 57:26.720]  Oh my god.
[57:27.220 --> 57:28.360]  Oh my god.
[57:29.320 --> 57:30.040]  What?
[57:30.600 --> 57:31.740]  It's so bad.
[57:32.320 --> 57:32.880]  I need ammo.
[57:34.020 --> 57:35.200]  Where's the nearest ammo?
[57:36.200 --> 57:38.300]  It's downstairs in the big circle.
[57:39.080 --> 57:40.860]  There's a triple packed
[57:40.860 --> 57:42.680]  gun and it is not
[57:42.680 --> 57:44.740]  killing dudes in one hit sometimes.
[57:45.560 --> 57:46.560]  Oh, fuck me.
[57:47.140 --> 57:48.580]  I turned around and there were like
[57:48.580 --> 57:50.620]  60 zombies running up the stairs.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.560]  I was going to say, watching Nick play is
[57:52.560 --> 57:54.500]  really interesting because he'll hole up and he's like
[57:54.500 --> 57:56.740]  yeah, I'm taking care of business. And then he turns around
[57:56.740 --> 57:58.820]  and it's 100 million zombies.
[57:59.580 --> 57:59.740]  Yeah.
[58:00.160 --> 58:01.060]  And everyone else is gone.
[58:01.540 --> 58:02.960]  Time to move.
[58:03.280 --> 58:04.340]  Where are my friends?
[58:05.400 --> 58:07.580]  Down where the ammo is.
[58:08.020 --> 58:08.760]  I'm going to come get you.
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.860]  I'm coming for you.
[58:12.080 --> 58:12.540]  Oh god.
[58:14.400 --> 58:15.220]  Can you save me?
[58:16.600 --> 58:17.380]  I'm on my way to you.
[58:18.020 --> 58:19.360]  These punches aren't that hard
[58:19.360 --> 58:21.440]  anymore. It's more like a slap.
[58:22.080 --> 58:22.740]  Flaccid punch.
[58:24.160 --> 58:24.900]  Slap a punch.
[58:25.180 --> 58:26.860]  What level are you on your pack-a-punch, Nick?
[58:28.640 --> 58:29.000]  Uh...
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.460]  That's a good question. I'm one less than the max.
[58:32.380 --> 58:33.000]  So he's two.
[58:34.480 --> 58:35.180]  Did you pay
[58:35.180 --> 58:36.980]  15 last time or did you pay 30?
[58:37.740 --> 58:38.100]  15.
[58:39.020 --> 58:41.280]  I need 10 times the amount of
[58:41.280 --> 58:42.960]  money I've got to get to the next pack-a-punch.
[58:42.960 --> 58:45.020]  Dude, I need twice the amount of money
[58:45.020 --> 58:46.180]  I have just to buy ammo.
[58:47.440 --> 58:48.840]  It's fucking $5,000.
[58:49.440 --> 58:50.880]  It starts getting crazy.
[58:51.060 --> 58:52.120]  Like it gets so expensive.
[58:52.200 --> 58:52.680]  30!
[58:55.480 --> 58:56.680]  Now Andrew, what's the
[58:56.680 --> 58:58.140]  significance of getting to 31?
[58:58.880 --> 59:00.400]  It's the big month of 31.
[59:00.600 --> 59:02.020]  We talked about before you joined.
[59:02.180 --> 59:04.540]  Eric, dogs and cream. 31 flavors.
[59:04.880 --> 59:06.680]  The month of December. 31 days.
[59:06.780 --> 59:08.760]  31 days in July. We know that.
[59:09.020 --> 59:09.280]  Yep.
[59:09.920 --> 59:10.320]  Yep.
[59:12.300 --> 59:13.500]  I'm not sure
[59:13.500 --> 59:15.100]  but there are so many people that were like
[59:15.100 --> 59:16.760]  I can't believe they didn't know that.
[59:17.640 --> 59:19.580]  Geoff kept going, listen to my
[59:19.580 --> 59:20.640]  farts. I don't know.
[59:20.960 --> 59:21.880]  We're not going to know this.
[59:22.240 --> 59:25.020]  I never learned the finger knuckle thing at school.
[59:25.280 --> 59:25.800]  Oh, is that right?
[59:27.120 --> 59:28.800]  July is a big knuckle.
[59:30.020 --> 59:31.180]  I didn't know that either actually.
[59:31.460 --> 59:32.200]  I forgot about the knuckle.
[59:32.260 --> 59:33.000]  Oh, I went down.
[59:33.840 --> 59:37.280]  Geoff, I'm going to...
[59:39.060 --> 59:39.460]  Alright,
[59:39.540 --> 59:40.380]  Mangler's down.
[59:41.560 --> 59:43.200]  You can get closer to him and use your
[59:43.200 --> 59:44.660]  cool move. Or you can get swarmed.
[59:45.140 --> 59:45.800]  Both are good.
[59:47.620 --> 59:49.180]  I lost my ammo again.
[59:49.300 --> 59:50.780]  Can someone pick up a freaking ammo
[59:50.780 --> 59:52.860]  bastard? Yeah, no problem.
[59:53.720 --> 59:54.860]  Please die. Thank you.
[59:56.060 --> 59:57.240]  Why didn't you call it out
[59:57.240 --> 59:58.280]  earlier, Gavin? Jeez.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.040]  Oh, I bought ammo.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.040]  Oh, I bought ammo. I have ammo again.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:06.820]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.920]  Didn't you just get max ammo? We just got max ammo,
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.080]  but I was down, so I may
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.640]  not have... Oh, it didn't count when you were down?
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.520]  That sucks. That's crazy.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:16.940]  That sucks, buddy.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.060]  Hey, Andrew,
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.160]  are you a Kimbo on the... Do you have bolt guns?
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.700]  I sure am. I'm dual wielding.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.360]  I'm blasting. How does that...
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.920]  It's working pretty good for you?
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.920]  It is so good. I think
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.760]  I just unlocked it, so I'm excited.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.540]  Oh, you gotta put it on.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.860]  Yeah, you just gotta max the gun out
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.860]  to unlock it, I think. Geoff, don't forget, you need
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.160]  the drink. Oh, yeah, I know.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.800]  I need the money to buy it. Well, you're on
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.700]  insta-kill, so... Oh, you don't have the money.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.280]  Never mind.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.600]  Now, you almost do. Now you do.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480]  Alright, let's go. I'll follow you.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.500]  I can't. I'm down.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.720]  I don't know how I just turned around.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.380]  I'm Swiss cheese, dude.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.320]  It's so tough at this level.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.180]  It's so funny.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.640]  I freaking ran out of ammo again. Andrew, do the thing again.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.420]  Do the magic.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.360]  Do the magic.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.060]  Dude, you held them up just long enough.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.140]  What a move. Nick, what a move. That was
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.860]  killer. Thank you. That was
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.080]  like crazy teamwork, dude. Good work.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.360]  I sacrificed my best
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.020]  move to save Geoff. Thank you.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.120]  Plate up. Use an armor plate. Oh, thank you.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.020]  Should we go get Geoff his juice? Oh, I need ammo.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.340]  Yeah, we're 31 now.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.200]  Should we exfil? Do we exfil or do we
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.980]  get the juice and exfil?
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.520]  Let's do it. I've seen the number 31.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.020]  I think you got to 31.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:32.760]  You should exfil.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.200]  I'm excited to see what
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.360]  this exfil looks like.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.020]  I've been doing it in solo.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.500]  I'm bringing up the rear.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.100]  It's going to be pretty hard to do at this level
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.240]  with four people, I imagine.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.480]  Just keep moving.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.100]  Oh, God.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.880]  I'm calling it in.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:54.900]  I'm going to call
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.800]  this in, Nick, and then it'll show a different area
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.940]  on the map we have to get to and secure within a minute.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.940]  Perfect. I love it. It's great.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:02.940]  Exfilling.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:04.900]  Don't you need people to
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.540]  accept? Hit up on the d-pad.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:07.720]  Oh, thank you.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.000]  Oh, good call out, Eric.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:13.800]  Nice.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.840]  Okay, I think it's
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.080]  time to move, huh?
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.660]  I'm waiting for us to get
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.300]  a symbol.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.660]  My capture computer just went green.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.140]  What? What do you mean it went green?
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.760]  The whole screen is green.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.480]  What?
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.900]  Oh, exfil's
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:35.800]  all the way across the map.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.220]  Where is it?
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.500]  It's an orange diamond
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.920]  with a helicopter.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:42.920]  Oh, I see it now.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.100]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.620]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:47.900]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.680]  Oh, it's bad everywhere.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.420]  How do we even get there?
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.840]  You gotta run around the island, I think.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.800]  I'm down.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.480]  The goal was to make it 31 days.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.840]  31 levels.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.100]  There's a ton of them right there.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.380]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.300]  If you think about it, the goal was really
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.160]  just to kill 31 zombies.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.360]  I think we accomplished that.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.780]  I can't move for freaking zombies, son.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.280]  Is it because your capture computer is green?
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.220]  That's a part of it.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.340]  Oh, no.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.840]  Where do we go?
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.040]  Run, Geoff!
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.220]  I'm down again!
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:29.160]  I'm down again!
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.940]  He sacrificed himself for Geoff.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:31.780]  I'm down again.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.060]  The nice thing about it is
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.280]  every time I go down, I get ammo.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.220]  For the team!
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.840]  For the team!
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:46.480]  For the team!
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.140]  It's not for the team, it's just for Andrew.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.260]  For the team!
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.060]  It's just for Andrew.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.300]  I have to do this!
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.220]  I'm sorry!
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.280]  I don't know which way to go, though!
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.360]  He just Nick ran away from you
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.960]  immediately into zombies.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.740]  Geoff, this is how it would go in real life.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.860]  This is how I want to go, too.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.200]  Come here, buddy.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.220]  It's been a great life.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.820]  It's been a good time.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.380]  I loved it. Hold me.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.220]  Let's go out together.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.280]  Maybe if I reach for the corpses...
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.240]  Oh, it's me.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.700]  I won! I lived slightly longer!
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.260]  This is exactly what it's going to be like in real life, too.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.720]  I'm, like, fucking 13 years older than you.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.300]  You better live slightly longer.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.040]  I died whispering in your ear.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:29.620]  Did you see that?
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.020]  I just want to be close to my friends' bodies.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.820]  We're not friends anymore.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.760]  Yeah, no kidding!
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.780]  Sorry about my footage.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.340]  Don't worry, Andrew's going to exfil.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.480]  For the team!
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:56.020]  For the team!
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.920]  Andrew, you've got to tell our story.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.440]  For the team!
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:03.240]  For the team!
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.500]  You'll probably leave out the part where you let us all die.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.520]  Hey, look! We're all there!
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.000]  It was an unfortunate incident.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.640]  Their love was too much.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.120]  They loved each other so much.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.120]  They burnt so bright.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.780]  Nick, I don't know what happened to him.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.840]  Nick left everyone in the dust.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.860]  Nice! Not bad.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:27.960]  Not bad.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.400]  What a run!
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.760]  Second most door-bys, I'll take it.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:35.660]  Nice!
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.640]  Andrew had almost three times the kills I did.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.560]  Although dying was a real setback for me.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.220]  I'm very excited to see Nick's level progression here.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.400]  Started at three.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.180]  He's at six now.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:52.980]  Seven.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:55.900]  Eight.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.520]  Here's nine.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.020]  I'm back to the main menu.
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.380]  Going to ten.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.940]  Hang on, Nick's still leveling up.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.460]  At eleven.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.360]  That's got to be it.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.300]  Sorry guys, he's only level eleven now.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.280]  That was fun.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:13.980]  That was so much fun.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.180]  Thank you so much for joining us in another Regulation gameplay.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.680]  Make sure to check out our Patreon.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.020]  The RegulationPod.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.120]  Regulatrion.com
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.480]  We got a merch store.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.140]  We sell a shirt currently.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.280]  Or maybe more. It's the future. Who knows?
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.100]  I don't know what's there.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.440]  Until then though.
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:31.860]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:32.860]  Goodbye.
