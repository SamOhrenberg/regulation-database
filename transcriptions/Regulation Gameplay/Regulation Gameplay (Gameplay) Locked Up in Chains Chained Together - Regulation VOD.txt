[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  Alright, here goes the go live button. It's go live and we are live now. Hi everybody. Happy Friday.
[00:06.760 --> 00:07.480]  We're live?
[00:09.880 --> 00:15.080]  Oh my god, I don't like the way we start stuff. I don't like the way we start. Gavin doesn't want me to be here.
[00:15.600 --> 00:17.260]  Gavin's trying to kick me out of this stream.
[00:18.060 --> 00:23.060]  You're chatting shit there. No, no, I'm not. You're trying to push me out. I'm trying- you're trying to squeeze me.
[00:23.220 --> 00:27.680]  It's not about squeezing you out. It's about holding Eric accountable. It's about holding Eric down.
[00:27.680 --> 00:30.440]  I was gonna say, I don't know if accountable...
[00:31.820 --> 00:34.280]  Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't know if accountable is the right word here,
[00:34.400 --> 00:38.780]  but I mean, holding Eric down is maybe more what you were looking for. Accountable again,
[00:38.940 --> 00:40.960]  I don't know if that's the term you're going for.
[00:42.920 --> 00:43.880]  I ain't scared of this.
[00:44.620 --> 00:47.260]  Do you guys know how you can do a countdown? Three, two, one, go.
[00:47.960 --> 00:52.760]  Run? Oh, really? One, go. I just hit the button. What? That might be new. Oh!
[00:53.160 --> 00:56.800]  That's right, I guess if you were a psychopath and you were playing without voice.
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.660]  Dude, could you imagine? That would be crazy. Hey guys, what's up? We're playing
[01:04.640 --> 01:11.880]  Chain Together. Are we playing Chain Together? We are. I mean, I could leave if you- I mean, if you want me to leave, I can take off, dude.
[01:12.160 --> 01:14.300]  Oh, the chat's full of piss rats.
[01:14.680 --> 01:18.000]  Happy- okay. We need you to be here in case one of us
[01:19.000 --> 01:19.960]  drops all of a sudden.
[01:21.820 --> 01:22.180]  Drops?
[01:27.120 --> 01:30.980]  How do I pull you?
[01:31.660 --> 01:39.120]  So, Geoff, Mick, Gavin, and Andrew are playing on this one. I'm still stuck!
[01:39.560 --> 01:41.520]  Okay, you're fine. Come on. Who's on the ends?
[01:43.880 --> 01:50.900]  I am on an end. I'm number uno. Uh-oh, uh-oh, I'm on the end. I'm always second chain. Yeah, you're always in the middle.
[01:52.020 --> 01:57.580]  Always a chain's made. Yeah, second. Let's just go. Never a chain. It's because I'm always very keen to join the lobby,
[01:57.720 --> 02:03.860]  but I'm never forward-thinking enough to host. You are not keen to join the lobby. You're the least keen to join any lobby.
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.920]  I was the second one in. What do you mean?
[02:06.080 --> 02:11.680]  Yeah, but you wouldn't want to even spell Geoff. No, you're always complaining about whoever's hosting. You're always yelling at me for my hosting ability.
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.080]  I'm complaining with your hosting.
[02:13.280 --> 02:14.860]  Why are we so slow?
[02:15.180 --> 02:20.360]  I mean, based on- Gavin, I'm with you with his hosting abilities. With the game we played yesterday,
[02:20.360 --> 02:22.940]  that was a mess. Yes, Andrew hosts like shit.
[02:23.520 --> 02:23.880]  Jump.
[02:24.800 --> 02:26.840]  What did we play yesterday?
[02:27.280 --> 02:30.860]  Coff. Wreckfest. Oh, Wreckfest. Why is there a car?
[02:31.360 --> 02:34.220]  Do you not remember the name of the game? Or do you think you're being secretive?
[02:34.500 --> 02:35.580]  Yeah, I think he's being secretive.
[02:35.660 --> 02:38.800]  I don't want to spoil the Wreckfest.
[02:39.040 --> 02:41.160]  Andrew, for the love of God.
[02:41.240 --> 02:44.660]  Thanks Zojjar for the subs. Appreciate you.
[02:44.900 --> 02:46.160]  Hey, thanks Zojjar.
[02:47.120 --> 02:48.580]  I'm keeping an eye on the chat.
[02:48.580 --> 02:50.020]  I want to get further than you guys got.
[02:50.600 --> 02:52.540]  What? We're not going to.
[02:52.720 --> 02:55.260]  I'm saying I want to go further than you guys got.
[02:55.380 --> 02:56.300]  We gotta go fast.
[02:57.040 --> 02:59.080]  I agree. Yeah, I gotta agree with Andrew.
[02:59.180 --> 03:00.400]  Put him at the front and let's see what happens.
[03:00.420 --> 03:02.200]  I have a question. Who's at the back of the chain?
[03:02.280 --> 03:05.120]  What the Christ are they doing? It's Geoff. He's fucking around.
[03:05.340 --> 03:06.100]  Could you hurry up?
[03:06.440 --> 03:07.780]  Oh, I didn't know y'all were in a hurry. Sorry.
[03:09.180 --> 03:11.260]  You made me go faster than I was comfortable
[03:11.260 --> 03:12.040]  and that's what happened.
[03:14.260 --> 03:16.020]  Pull the chain, moron.
[03:16.140 --> 03:17.500]  Not you, me. I'm talking to me.
[03:19.400 --> 03:21.120]  Yeah, it'd be a bit early
[03:21.120 --> 03:22.140]  to be calling us morons.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.760]  It'll be coming in about 20 minutes.
[03:24.980 --> 03:26.740]  Whoops, there goes Geoff.
[03:27.080 --> 03:27.420]  Shortcut.
[03:28.680 --> 03:30.800]  If I go too fast, I make mistakes.
[03:30.920 --> 03:32.180]  If I go too slow, I'm perfect.
[03:32.920 --> 03:35.020]  If I go too slow,
[03:35.180 --> 03:36.080]  I'm perfect?
[03:36.520 --> 03:38.260]  He's never made any mistakes when going slow.
[03:38.620 --> 03:41.140]  I don't know if I like being next to Geoff in the chain.
[03:41.800 --> 03:42.960]  Yeah, I don't know if I like you
[03:42.960 --> 03:44.160]  being next to Geoff in the chain.
[03:44.500 --> 03:47.120]  I just watched you do it.
[03:47.120 --> 03:48.860]  Why wouldn't it let me grab the chain?
[03:49.040 --> 03:51.480]  I'm so fucking happy it's Friday.
[03:51.820 --> 03:53.460]  You remember that conversation we had about
[03:53.460 --> 03:55.320]  5.01 PM? I'm feeling it.
[03:55.400 --> 03:57.180]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[03:59.100 --> 04:00.460]  What was that in?
[04:00.700 --> 04:03.560]  It's hard to remember, isn't it? I think it's an episode of the podcast.
[04:03.760 --> 04:04.260]  Yeah, it's an episode.
[04:05.140 --> 04:07.440]  We had to tune in for an amazing
[04:07.440 --> 04:08.780]  conversation about 5.01.
[04:11.600 --> 04:12.980]  I'm still thinking about 5.01.
[04:13.740 --> 04:15.420]  I'm watching Gavin's
[04:15.420 --> 04:17.960]  gameplay, just so everyone knows.
[04:18.140 --> 04:19.740]  I'm on his side for this.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.840]  I gotta say, unless it's
[04:23.840 --> 04:25.980]  egregious, but then even still
[04:25.980 --> 04:27.980]  maybe I won't see it
[04:27.980 --> 04:28.460]  that way.
[04:28.920 --> 04:30.280]  Alright, time it together.
[04:33.540 --> 04:34.840]  I'm on Gavin's side.
[04:35.540 --> 04:37.680]  Look, we've done this a thousand times.
[04:37.740 --> 04:38.500]  We know what we're doing.
[04:38.880 --> 04:40.500]  We got a wild card now.
[04:42.500 --> 04:43.780]  Andrew's been a pretty tame
[04:43.780 --> 04:45.080]  wild card so far.
[04:45.280 --> 04:47.040]  Why would you jinx it?
[04:47.320 --> 04:49.260]  Alright, now let's get in order.
[04:51.100 --> 04:52.240]  I'm Geoff going first.
[04:52.440 --> 04:53.960]  Alright, that's...
[04:55.460 --> 04:56.520]  I'm getting a little bit
[04:56.520 --> 04:57.280]  bunced around here.
[04:58.580 --> 04:59.000]  I'm second.
[04:59.740 --> 05:01.780]  Why doesn't one of the two ends
[05:01.780 --> 05:03.600]  go to the fucking end?
[05:04.820 --> 05:05.600]  What does it matter?
[05:06.840 --> 05:08.280]  Nick, you need to not
[05:08.280 --> 05:09.180]  be where you are.
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.060]  That's certain.
[05:12.060 --> 05:13.480]  I gotta say, for someone
[05:13.480 --> 05:15.520]  who hasn't played it, Andrew is nailing it.
[05:15.560 --> 05:17.140]  You just go through, it's easy.
[05:17.620 --> 05:19.640]  He's already played in his personal life.
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.880]  Oh, definitely. He's played this without us.
[05:22.100 --> 05:23.960]  Absolutely. He's played this without us.
[05:24.020 --> 05:25.460]  I played once the day
[05:25.460 --> 05:27.820]  you guys played, and then I had to nap
[05:27.820 --> 05:29.140]  as soon as I played.
[05:29.400 --> 05:30.760]  I played for 45 minutes.
[05:31.180 --> 05:33.060]  And I beat it, and then I took a nap.
[05:35.040 --> 05:37.520]  I was so drained from watching you all play
[05:37.520 --> 05:38.680]  and then the first time we fell.
[05:39.760 --> 05:41.280]  Oh, were you drained?
[05:41.560 --> 05:42.900]  Yeah, I was.
[05:43.400 --> 05:45.240]  Nick, do you have extra catering on this time?
[05:45.260 --> 05:46.300]  I'm prepared to be drained today.
[05:46.720 --> 05:48.320]  Not enough. I'm already sweating.
[05:48.780 --> 05:49.800]  Let's climb up that hardy.
[05:50.780 --> 05:51.520]  It's cold.
[05:57.140 --> 05:58.140]  Go think and laugh.
[05:58.420 --> 05:59.020]  Go, go, go.
[06:01.460 --> 06:05.040]  I'm telling you, we're going to do
[06:05.040 --> 06:06.200]  better than you guys did.
[06:06.820 --> 06:08.860]  It's almost as if we removed the weak link.
[06:09.660 --> 06:11.000]  But I'm still here,
[06:11.100 --> 06:12.180]  so it makes no sense.
[06:12.740 --> 06:13.880]  But I got to agree with you.
[06:14.040 --> 06:16.880]  You take out me, and all of a sudden
[06:16.880 --> 06:18.500]  you guys are flying through this thing, no problem.
[06:18.580 --> 06:19.440]  I don't even think you're going to fall.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.520]  There's a lot less angry yelling so far.
[06:22.660 --> 06:24.720]  The only person that's yelled at Nick so far
[06:24.720 --> 06:25.180]  is Nick.
[06:27.340 --> 06:27.740]  Good start.
[06:28.400 --> 06:29.760]  I'd be interested in the chat
[06:30.240 --> 06:31.840]  guessing how high we get today.
[06:31.900 --> 06:32.980]  Down, down, down!
[06:36.220 --> 06:37.980]  You absolute fool.
[06:38.400 --> 06:39.920]  No! You fool!
[06:40.520 --> 06:41.500]  You fool!
[06:41.640 --> 06:44.780]  Someone else did that.
[06:45.240 --> 06:45.900]  We're going real down.
[06:47.000 --> 06:47.780]  It's not too bad.
[06:48.300 --> 06:49.820]  On the record, I never hit the ground.
[06:51.900 --> 06:53.300]  I'm still on the tower.
[06:54.200 --> 06:54.960]  It's fine.
[06:56.100 --> 06:58.160]  Who is that? Who is at the bottom?
[06:58.320 --> 06:58.760]  Who is slow?
[06:59.300 --> 06:59.800]  No.
[07:02.180 --> 07:03.520]  We got to call that out.
[07:03.520 --> 07:04.560]  We got to wait together.
[07:07.120 --> 07:08.080]  Prediction result,
[07:08.260 --> 07:09.700]  according to our moderators,
[07:09.880 --> 07:11.480]  Geoff caused the fall.
[07:12.020 --> 07:13.980]  I'm supposed to be in last place.
[07:14.080 --> 07:16.360]  I got yelled at when I wasn't in last place.
[07:16.380 --> 07:17.560]  Yeah, not that last.
[07:18.240 --> 07:19.720]  What? Oh my god.
[07:20.720 --> 07:21.620]  You move, we move.
[07:21.900 --> 07:22.440]  We all move.
[07:22.820 --> 07:25.160]  When you move, I move.
[07:25.360 --> 07:25.840]  Just like that.
[07:28.360 --> 07:31.380]  DJ, bring that back!
[07:31.380 --> 07:32.140]  Yeah.
[07:33.660 --> 07:35.380]  Stop doing the Eric thing!
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.980]  I like to be Peter Pan.
[07:38.180 --> 07:38.620]  I fly.
[07:38.920 --> 07:41.900]  When everyone's going up on the elevator, it feels good, right?
[07:42.960 --> 07:43.460]  It does.
[07:43.560 --> 07:44.240]  And I'm wearing the green.
[07:45.140 --> 07:48.800]  Let me turn Geoff and Gavin up a hair.
[07:49.100 --> 07:50.420]  Geoff is trying to speed run.
[07:51.220 --> 07:52.420]  Jesus, Geoff!
[07:52.900 --> 07:54.500]  Stop being so slow!
[07:55.700 --> 07:57.680]  I thought you wanted me to be faster!
[07:59.380 --> 08:00.260]  Why won't it let me pull?
[08:00.260 --> 08:02.420]  I'll give you what you ask for,
[08:02.560 --> 08:05.000]  but when I do, you better fucking like it!
[08:05.520 --> 08:06.680]  What have you given me?
[08:07.400 --> 08:09.200]  Oh, the bloody hell's still down!
[08:10.500 --> 08:10.520]  Speed!
[08:10.520 --> 08:10.900]  There we go.
[08:11.580 --> 08:14.100]  Speed? One fricking jump on the platform!
[08:14.200 --> 08:14.720]  How about that?
[08:14.960 --> 08:15.960]  I can do that too.
[08:18.960 --> 08:20.640]  We'll try for both at the same time.
[08:21.300 --> 08:21.900]  Oh, look at this.
[08:22.860 --> 08:23.120]  Nailing it.
[08:24.180 --> 08:24.660]  Alright.
[08:25.100 --> 08:26.760]  That was on me.
[08:28.020 --> 08:30.000]  I'll be cannibal if it's my fault.
[08:30.080 --> 08:30.560]  That was on me.
[08:30.680 --> 08:31.420]  I missed that one.
[08:31.520 --> 08:34.440]  I can't wait to one day be at the front or the back.
[08:34.620 --> 08:35.860]  I hate being in the middle.
[08:36.380 --> 08:36.800]  Host the game!
[08:37.100 --> 08:38.840]  I'm in the middle and I'm at the back somehow.
[08:41.060 --> 08:43.000]  I didn't want to be at the fucking back or front
[08:43.000 --> 08:43.820]  or whatever I am.
[08:44.700 --> 08:47.540]  We learned a valuable lesson from the first video, guys.
[08:47.720 --> 08:49.220]  Remember, to pull someone up,
[08:49.320 --> 08:51.320]  you have to look in their direction also.
[08:51.900 --> 08:52.860]  I didn't know that.
[08:54.200 --> 08:55.200]  Look at them.
[08:55.200 --> 08:56.920]  You gotta look at the chain.
[08:57.100 --> 08:58.500]  You don't get the prompt otherwise.
[08:59.400 --> 09:01.620]  Otherwise, you'll slide all over the place.
[09:05.020 --> 09:06.020]  You motherfucker.
[09:07.160 --> 09:07.640]  Oh, Geoff.
[09:08.080 --> 09:09.660]  You motherfucker.
[09:12.400 --> 09:13.920]  Whoever pulled me back
[09:13.920 --> 09:14.980]  when I jumped in the air.
[09:15.760 --> 09:17.360]  There was no slack.
[09:17.680 --> 09:18.380]  You were so far ahead.
[09:19.260 --> 09:21.460]  Catch up, slow motherfuckers.
[09:21.660 --> 09:23.120]  Oh my god.
[09:23.900 --> 09:25.540]  Guys, thanks for all the subs.
[09:26.460 --> 09:27.700]  Guys, thanks for all the subs
[09:27.700 --> 09:28.620]  so far on our Twitch channel.
[09:28.780 --> 09:30.180]  We're watching this live on Twitch.
[09:30.480 --> 09:32.720]  We're live every Friday at 4pm Central.
[09:33.060 --> 09:35.940]  We have just broken our record for most subs.
[09:36.120 --> 09:37.320]  Oh my god.
[09:37.680 --> 09:39.380]  You know what? I just learned
[09:39.380 --> 09:41.860]  sub is short for subscription,
[09:42.080 --> 09:42.820]  not submarine.
[09:44.020 --> 09:44.760]  Or substitution.
[09:46.540 --> 09:47.280]  Like Eric.
[09:47.540 --> 09:49.540]  See, we don't even need to vocalize this anymore.
[09:49.700 --> 09:50.540]  We're nailing this.
[09:50.540 --> 09:53.460]  We appreciate you guys watching live
[09:53.460 --> 09:54.940]  and the VOD goes up Tuesday
[09:54.940 --> 09:56.380]  just like all of our other Twitch VODs.
[09:56.440 --> 09:58.140]  So if there's anything you missed, you can watch it later
[09:58.140 --> 10:00.300]  on Tuesday on the Regulation Gameplay channel
[10:00.300 --> 10:02.060]  where you can go subscribe now. Isn't that great?
[10:02.380 --> 10:04.340]  But what you can't do on the VOD...
[10:04.340 --> 10:05.780]  Slow asses.
[10:06.260 --> 10:08.040]  You can't do pissrat on the VOD.
[10:08.240 --> 10:10.280]  You can't do pissrat. You can only do pissrat here
[10:10.280 --> 10:12.720]  and corncat, which I found
[10:12.720 --> 10:14.660]  the TikTok channel that has
[10:14.660 --> 10:17.080]  all the newest corncats posted almost daily.
[10:18.100 --> 10:20.740]  Eric is trying so hard to turt to it.
[10:20.780 --> 10:23.000]  Off you skate pissrat with corncat.
[10:23.120 --> 10:23.820]  That's not gonna happen.
[10:24.020 --> 10:24.740]  I was the last one up.
[10:25.800 --> 10:26.880]  That was Andrew.
[10:27.560 --> 10:28.600]  What do you mean that was me?
[10:28.940 --> 10:29.640]  You were the last one up.
[10:31.580 --> 10:33.300]  How do you two keep falling?
[10:33.600 --> 10:34.280]  I didn't fall.
[10:35.940 --> 10:37.740]  I'm in the middle of the chain
[10:37.740 --> 10:39.700]  and the two idiots on either side of me
[10:39.700 --> 10:41.760]  yank me senseless.
[10:42.100 --> 10:44.180]  I'm in the back of the chain.
[10:44.860 --> 10:45.860]  I'll be in the back.
[10:46.620 --> 10:48.160]  I'm in the front.
[10:49.040 --> 10:51.040]  According to our moderators,
[10:51.260 --> 10:52.600]  the person who made them fall
[10:53.220 --> 10:53.820]  Gavin.
[10:54.700 --> 10:55.300]  Gavin!
[10:56.460 --> 10:59.120]  This happened last time too.
[10:59.200 --> 10:59.920]  Everyone shut up.
[11:00.340 --> 11:02.260]  When two people
[11:03.340 --> 11:05.440]  go around a right angle
[11:05.440 --> 11:07.040]  like a 90 degree turn
[11:07.040 --> 11:09.400]  if the third person isn't doing it yet
[11:09.400 --> 11:10.860]  and the first person's hauling ass
[11:10.860 --> 11:13.120]  the second person goes flying off.
[11:13.580 --> 11:14.200]  Why don't we go right?
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.800]  Yeah, we're gonna go right next time. No, let's go right.
[11:17.400 --> 11:18.540]  What? There's a right?
[11:20.720 --> 11:22.580]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[11:22.660 --> 11:23.300]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[11:25.040 --> 11:25.900]  They pulled me.
[11:26.800 --> 11:28.640]  They pulled me into that. They did that to me.
[11:30.000 --> 11:30.680]  See, this is shorter.
[11:30.860 --> 11:31.820]  Why are we going this way?
[11:31.920 --> 11:34.180]  Because we've never been this way before.
[11:34.220 --> 11:36.060]  That's true. I don't think we've ever been that way.
[11:36.700 --> 11:37.880]  I didn't know we could go that way.
[11:38.140 --> 11:38.920]  I'm learning.
[11:40.200 --> 11:42.740]  Look at Gavin leading the pack
[11:42.740 --> 11:43.700]  and now he's off.
[11:45.280 --> 11:46.800]  Great job, Gavin. Lead by example.
[11:48.160 --> 11:49.040]  Go, Geoff, go.
[11:49.760 --> 11:50.300]  Go, Geoff, go.
[11:51.600 --> 11:53.200]  Don't encourage me to go fast
[11:53.200 --> 11:55.360]  because then you'll bitch at me when I'm too far ahead.
[11:55.660 --> 11:56.360]  No, no, no, no.
[11:57.380 --> 12:00.960]  You motherfuckers aren't impossible to please.
[12:02.200 --> 12:02.840]  That's true.
[12:03.960 --> 12:04.700]  Just don't fall.
[12:05.340 --> 12:06.620]  I think we're pretty easy to please.
[12:07.780 --> 12:08.380]  Just don't fall.
[12:08.660 --> 12:10.080]  I'll keep that in mind.
[12:10.080 --> 12:11.420]  Just don't fall.
[12:11.600 --> 12:12.860]  Just don't fall.
[12:14.480 --> 12:14.660]  Shortcut.
[12:16.640 --> 12:17.680]  Alright, Nick!
[12:18.460 --> 12:21.200]  It's okay. I pulled myself up by my bootstraps.
[12:21.780 --> 12:22.680]  Good save.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.500]  I don't think you're allowed to say that anymore.
[12:25.160 --> 12:25.720]  Great save.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.200]  Nick's a bootstraps guy, huh?
[12:28.960 --> 12:30.120]  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.
[12:31.180 --> 12:32.400]  Jesus, the rain boots.
[12:32.420 --> 12:34.040]  Real 2018 of you, Nick.
[12:34.560 --> 12:34.980]  No!
[12:41.160 --> 12:42.560]  Isn't it fun to be alive?
[12:47.260 --> 12:48.760]  I like these sections
[12:48.760 --> 12:50.220]  because you can relax a little bit.
[12:50.480 --> 12:52.400]  Yeah, you can get a sip of water.
[12:52.840 --> 12:54.580]  Yeah, it's good time
[12:54.580 --> 12:55.060]  to refresh.
[12:55.540 --> 12:57.660]  It's when you can tug on clothing a little bit.
[12:57.880 --> 12:59.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:59.100 --> 13:00.620]  Holy shit.
[13:02.520 --> 13:03.740]  Nice and easy.
[13:04.040 --> 13:04.660]  Look at that.
[13:06.420 --> 13:07.680]  Oh, Gavin with the height.
[13:07.680 --> 13:09.540]  Wow, just pulling everyone up.
[13:09.620 --> 13:11.020]  Gavin, carry that weight.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.300]  Alright, now I'm going to take my position
[13:13.300 --> 13:14.600]  as second in the line.
[13:15.020 --> 13:16.280]  And I'll be third.
[13:16.540 --> 13:18.180]  And I'm in the back of the pack.
[13:18.200 --> 13:20.480]  Keep in mind that there are 90 degree turns
[13:20.480 --> 13:23.120]  and people don't want to get sucked off the side.
[13:23.940 --> 13:25.340]  Alright, you don't want to get sucked off.
[13:25.680 --> 13:27.880]  Also keep in mind that I'm going first
[13:27.880 --> 13:29.120]  and I don't know where to go.
[13:29.600 --> 13:30.700]  Cool, yeah, keep that in mind.
[13:30.700 --> 13:31.520]  We'll direct you.
[13:32.240 --> 13:34.280]  Go right. There you go, straight.
[13:35.460 --> 13:36.860]  Then straight and right, right?
[13:37.320 --> 13:39.180]  Or do I go straight and straight?
[13:39.600 --> 13:40.960]  Yeah, straight and then right.
[13:41.260 --> 13:42.400]  Okay, I guess I did know where to go.
[13:42.580 --> 13:44.360]  Oh, hold on, hold on, Geoff. Hold on.
[13:44.540 --> 13:45.800]  Hold on.
[13:48.160 --> 13:48.940]  What's going on?
[13:49.280 --> 13:49.600]  Why are we going?
[13:51.040 --> 13:53.060]  Keep the wee whisper going.
[13:55.500 --> 13:56.800]  What was all the panic for?
[13:57.040 --> 13:58.600]  What on earth did I just do?
[13:59.560 --> 14:00.860]  Do you want to
[14:00.860 --> 14:02.320]  address the panic at any point
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.940]  or do we just get to never...
[14:03.940 --> 14:06.540]  Oh, you were pulling me off the right angle again.
[14:07.440 --> 14:07.840]  How?
[14:08.700 --> 14:09.960]  You were getting tugged off?
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.500]  He's getting tugged off.
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.200]  He doesn't want to get sucked off. I don't know what's going on.
[14:15.700 --> 14:17.240]  He wants it to be a surprise.
[14:17.400 --> 14:18.480]  He wants to get tugged off.
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.680]  He just doesn't want to know about it in advance.
[14:20.160 --> 14:21.040]  Who did that?
[14:22.760 --> 14:24.340]  Let us know who fell.
[14:24.480 --> 14:26.120]  I'm excited to see what the mods think.
[14:26.260 --> 14:27.580]  Who did that?
[14:29.060 --> 14:31.680]  That sounds like a Gavin.
[14:31.680 --> 14:33.180]  I flew off.
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.380]  How was there no grabbage?
[14:37.060 --> 14:37.720]  I don't...
[14:37.720 --> 14:39.220]  I think it was Gav, Gavin.
[14:39.340 --> 14:41.240]  That was Gavin, Gav, Gavin.
[14:41.900 --> 14:43.840]  I'll take that one.
[14:43.920 --> 14:44.440]  I'm just very...
[14:44.440 --> 14:46.920]  Prediction result according to our mods.
[14:47.580 --> 14:47.920]  Nick!
[14:49.000 --> 14:49.200]  Oh!
[14:51.020 --> 14:53.520]  Because I was standing there with Geoff when I got tugged.
[14:54.120 --> 14:55.360]  You got tugged off direction.
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.840]  I think there was no grabbage for me
[14:57.840 --> 14:59.300]  because there was nothing to grab
[14:59.300 --> 15:00.920]  at the angle I was standing at.
[15:01.900 --> 15:03.660]  Andrew, don't you want to just hang off the elevator?
[15:04.700 --> 15:05.240]  No, I'm good.
[15:05.540 --> 15:06.680]  You know what? I got out of my system.
[15:07.160 --> 15:08.340]  I flew around a little bit.
[15:08.580 --> 15:10.400]  I thought we were going right.
[15:11.700 --> 15:12.960]  This is way faster.
[15:13.060 --> 15:13.480]  I disagree.
[15:14.400 --> 15:15.620]  I'm a team guy.
[15:17.060 --> 15:18.580]  I said I'm a team guy.
[15:18.720 --> 15:19.160]  I'm not fighting.
[15:20.820 --> 15:23.240]  Andrew's been surprisingly a team guy this whole time.
[15:23.560 --> 15:24.560]  I've been...
[15:24.560 --> 15:25.620]  I haven't fallen.
[15:25.620 --> 15:27.640]  Andrew's like the...
[15:27.640 --> 15:30.280]  He's like the anti-Eric.
[15:31.120 --> 15:32.760]  I'm a big morale guy
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.720]  in this scenario.
[15:35.160 --> 15:35.980]  We can do this.
[15:36.100 --> 15:36.760]  We'll be fine.
[15:38.480 --> 15:40.260]  Andrew, what are you sensing about the vibes
[15:40.260 --> 15:40.840]  of this team?
[15:41.240 --> 15:43.200]  Right now, the vibes are pretty good.
[15:43.720 --> 15:44.680]  All things considered.
[15:45.260 --> 15:46.780]  That was...
[15:48.060 --> 15:50.040]  We're back in Andrew's vibe era.
[15:50.360 --> 15:52.760]  Yeah, he's the vibe connoisseur, dude.
[15:53.380 --> 15:54.540]  He's the vibe inspector.
[15:54.540 --> 15:57.740]  We've revisited that this week.
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.200]  Can we come back for a second?
[15:59.380 --> 16:01.260]  Can we come back for a second?
[16:02.420 --> 16:04.080]  Let's just jump across this.
[16:05.560 --> 16:06.880]  There goes Nick.
[16:07.740 --> 16:08.660]  Pull me up, please.
[16:08.920 --> 16:09.360]  Thank you.
[16:10.180 --> 16:11.360]  You want to jump in on three?
[16:11.740 --> 16:13.800]  Oh no!
[16:14.840 --> 16:16.460]  Was that better?
[16:17.040 --> 16:17.520]  No.
[16:19.880 --> 16:20.840]  That guy's...
[16:20.840 --> 16:21.700]  I believe that was me.
[16:21.700 --> 16:23.340]  I believe I fucked that up.
[16:23.500 --> 16:25.460]  Just to let you guys know, right out the gate,
[16:25.960 --> 16:27.800]  I think that I'll take responsibility
[16:27.800 --> 16:28.920]  for that mistake.
[16:29.180 --> 16:32.020]  I believe I did.
[16:32.580 --> 16:34.120]  I just became too hot.
[16:34.460 --> 16:34.820]  Just then.
[16:37.140 --> 16:40.180]  It's funny you mentioned that.
[16:40.300 --> 16:42.360]  I also got very warm in that moment.
[16:42.520 --> 16:43.180]  That was the moment.
[16:43.760 --> 16:44.880]  Are you also wet, Nick?
[16:45.640 --> 16:47.660]  I also got very warm in that moment.
[16:48.220 --> 16:49.340]  Oh my god.
[16:50.020 --> 16:51.460]  I just beaded.
[16:53.080 --> 16:53.680]  Beaded!
[16:57.260 --> 16:58.660]  Oh my god.
[16:58.760 --> 16:59.500]  Guys, another prediction.
[16:59.800 --> 17:02.800]  As soon as the last prediction ends,
[17:03.260 --> 17:05.000]  the mods get another one going
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.640]  and people can't wait to bet their channel points on it.
[17:08.040 --> 17:09.960]  You got regulation points
[17:09.960 --> 17:11.240]  burning holes in your pockets.
[17:11.620 --> 17:13.080]  Lay them down. This rocks.
[17:15.400 --> 17:16.600]  Someone's off.
[17:17.620 --> 17:19.180]  I miss being
[17:19.180 --> 17:20.020]  on the end.
[17:20.380 --> 17:22.400]  Gavin wouldn't know.
[17:23.340 --> 17:24.720]  I don't know what it's like.
[17:24.840 --> 17:26.600]  Hey, Gavin, let me tell you. It's a lot more fun.
[17:26.820 --> 17:27.380]  On the end?
[17:28.380 --> 17:31.340]  There's a lot more freedom to not have people drag you down.
[17:31.360 --> 17:31.780]  A lot of responsibilities.
[17:32.320 --> 17:32.980]  Really? Okay.
[17:34.080 --> 17:36.740]  Maybe that's why I'm having such a good time, because I'm on the end.
[17:37.200 --> 17:38.000]  A lot of responsibilities.
[17:39.620 --> 17:41.760]  There is a lot of responsibility, though.
[17:42.260 --> 17:43.080]  Everybody here? Okay.
[17:43.740 --> 17:45.140]  Who was with me
[17:45.140 --> 17:47.400]  mid-chain last time?
[17:47.540 --> 17:48.500]  Okay, that's fine.
[17:48.620 --> 17:51.160]  Mid-chain was you and Geoff, I think.
[17:51.340 --> 17:52.660]  Yeah, you and I were in the middle.
[17:52.820 --> 17:54.460]  Stuck in the middle again.
[17:54.740 --> 17:56.880]  Dude, Gavin, we were just inside you, dude.
[17:56.960 --> 17:58.660]  I just saw my heart.
[17:58.960 --> 18:00.280]  Yeah, and it was racing.
[18:01.280 --> 18:02.280]  Alright, everyone just chill.
[18:03.020 --> 18:03.820]  Alright, now.
[18:06.240 --> 18:07.820]  Remember that there's a delay.
[18:08.740 --> 18:09.260]  That was not me.
[18:09.440 --> 18:10.820]  That was not me. Who was that?
[18:11.060 --> 18:12.360]  I think it was Gavin.
[18:12.360 --> 18:14.720]  What do you mean it was me? How was that me?
[18:14.960 --> 18:15.760]  It wasn't me.
[18:15.960 --> 18:16.940]  It might have been Andrew.
[18:16.940 --> 18:19.800]  There wasn't even time for the prediction to close.
[18:23.040 --> 18:25.140]  We need replays.
[18:25.240 --> 18:26.200]  Unless it was me.
[18:26.420 --> 18:27.760]  I don't want to see the replays.
[18:28.640 --> 18:30.280]  According to the moderator,
[18:31.140 --> 18:32.400]  the person who made you fall
[18:32.400 --> 18:33.380]  was Andrew.
[18:34.940 --> 18:36.720]  That was me, then. That's fine.
[18:37.640 --> 18:39.040]  Alright, here we go. Accountability for that.
[18:41.740 --> 18:43.140]  Can we get to that bit?
[18:43.380 --> 18:44.080]  The swimming bit?
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.480]  Yeah, we can do that.
[18:46.520 --> 18:47.420]  Let's do that.
[18:47.720 --> 18:50.360]  Of course we can.
[18:51.500 --> 18:53.320]  Shouts out to the corn cats in the chat.
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.300]  And, I guess, the piss rats.
[18:54.420 --> 18:55.620]  But mostly the corn cats. What's up?
[18:55.720 --> 18:56.240]  Piss rats!
[18:57.760 --> 18:59.480]  Thank you guys so much for the hype train.
[18:59.900 --> 19:02.340]  Thanks for the subs. Appreciate you guys watching live.
[19:02.840 --> 19:03.420]  This has been real.
[19:03.640 --> 19:03.840]  Oh, Gavin.
[19:05.240 --> 19:05.900]  That was my bad.
[19:06.660 --> 19:07.440]  It's okay.
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.220]  That was my bad. I don't know what to do here.
[19:10.500 --> 19:11.340]  Thank you.
[19:12.480 --> 19:14.500]  Nick just started walking away.
[19:15.040 --> 19:17.000]  I did. I thought about it.
[19:17.920 --> 19:18.640]  Oh, my God.
[19:18.780 --> 19:19.700]  Oh, no. I'm falling.
[19:20.540 --> 19:21.320]  I got tugged at.
[19:21.980 --> 19:24.440]  Why don't you just come down to this
[19:24.440 --> 19:25.740]  and start over on this part?
[19:26.640 --> 19:28.840]  Guys, I'm actually standing on the chain still.
[19:29.120 --> 19:30.180]  Oh, Nick is...
[19:30.180 --> 19:31.440]  Oh, Andrew in the front.
[19:32.120 --> 19:33.740]  Okay, you're pulling...
[19:33.740 --> 19:34.700]  It's okay. I'm walking.
[19:34.880 --> 19:37.500]  You keep walking. I'll keep walking. We're good.
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.160]  Just don't go too fast.
[19:39.380 --> 19:40.600]  I'm on the chain below.
[19:41.640 --> 19:42.720]  We'll restart now.
[19:43.960 --> 19:45.200]  Geoff, come back down.
[19:45.300 --> 19:45.720]  No, it's fine.
[19:47.500 --> 19:49.080]  Nick, you can jump up.
[19:50.200 --> 19:52.220]  Gavin is hanging like a baby
[19:52.220 --> 19:52.820]  in a swing set.
[19:55.140 --> 19:56.120]  I was just waiting
[19:56.120 --> 19:56.860]  for the consensus.
[19:57.740 --> 19:59.580]  Just arms and legs up.
[19:59.760 --> 20:02.180]  I fell off. I was hanging and I had no opinions.
[20:02.180 --> 20:03.300]  That's what happened.
[20:04.560 --> 20:05.640]  Yeah, that was me.
[20:05.960 --> 20:07.260]  I got a little glitchy on my end.
[20:08.620 --> 20:09.680]  We didn't fall.
[20:10.380 --> 20:11.820]  Oh man, this is so bad.
[20:12.460 --> 20:13.580]  Let's keep going straight.
[20:15.920 --> 20:17.100]  So, is this on normal?
[20:18.020 --> 20:18.320]  Yes.
[20:18.580 --> 20:18.980]  Okay.
[20:20.540 --> 20:22.500]  I don't know why people are so upset about
[20:22.500 --> 20:24.440]  like, put it on easy so you get checkpoints.
[20:24.640 --> 20:26.200]  It's like, just put it on normal and beat it.
[20:26.820 --> 20:27.020]  Yeah.
[20:29.340 --> 20:30.300]  You don't need a checkpoint
[20:30.300 --> 20:31.220]  if you don't die.
[20:31.520 --> 20:32.060]  That's what I'm saying.
[20:35.380 --> 20:36.380]  Excellent work.
[20:36.760 --> 20:37.320]  Oh no!
[20:38.260 --> 20:39.440]  I watched it.
[20:39.480 --> 20:40.960]  That was beautiful.
[20:41.540 --> 20:42.540]  Oh, I heard it.
[20:43.860 --> 20:47.060]  Gavin, if you hit R right now, does it do a countdown?
[20:47.880 --> 20:48.240]  Oh, cool.
[20:48.960 --> 20:49.420]  That's cool.
[20:50.300 --> 20:51.060]  Hold wide of boost.
[20:52.720 --> 20:54.240]  You guys are using mouse and keyboard for this?
[20:54.340 --> 20:55.320]  Hold wide of...
[20:55.320 --> 20:56.920]  There's a heist, guys.
[20:57.480 --> 20:58.620]  Oh my god.
[20:59.720 --> 21:00.160]  Man.
[21:01.340 --> 21:02.840]  Hold wide to boost finally came out.
[21:03.280 --> 21:03.980]  Oh yeah.
[21:05.520 --> 21:06.920]  Andrew holding wide of boost.
[21:07.120 --> 21:07.820]  It was Hangman's News.
[21:08.140 --> 21:09.780]  It was our Patreon video, right?
[21:11.420 --> 21:12.020]  Hangman's News.
[21:13.180 --> 21:15.360]  Which, by the way, it's wild that the same thing
[21:15.360 --> 21:17.520]  happened to me every time we played that game.
[21:18.140 --> 21:19.740]  Did you see that video we put together?
[21:19.940 --> 21:20.300]  Yeah.
[21:21.400 --> 21:23.640]  Some of us may remember the first time.
[21:25.320 --> 21:26.920]  So it might be engineering
[21:27.460 --> 21:28.760]  and maybe there's some
[21:30.720 --> 21:31.160]  social...
[21:31.160 --> 21:32.280]  It's pretty fucking funny, dude.
[21:32.840 --> 21:33.700]  It's pretty fucking funny.
[21:34.320 --> 21:35.660]  Someone has a long memory here.
[21:37.920 --> 21:39.160]  We have a Sausage Talk
[21:39.160 --> 21:40.820]  that comes out this Sunday, and if you're
[21:40.820 --> 21:42.480]  watching a lot of this, it's already out.
[21:43.340 --> 21:44.260]  That's free for everyone.
[21:44.500 --> 21:46.080]  I think it's our best Sausage Talk.
[21:46.460 --> 21:48.120]  I agree. I thought it was really good.
[21:49.300 --> 21:50.740]  Well, it's finally our
[21:50.740 --> 21:53.240]  Sausage Talk, right? It's not THE Sausage Talk.
[21:53.240 --> 21:55.740]  About the thing we run in a company.
[21:56.020 --> 21:56.820]  It's our company.
[21:56.980 --> 21:57.380]  Yep.
[21:59.380 --> 22:01.840]  It's a good one. We answer questions
[22:01.840 --> 22:03.500]  part of our Patreon
[22:03.500 --> 22:05.980]  is you can ask questions for Sausage Talk
[22:05.980 --> 22:07.500]  and Andrew
[22:07.500 --> 22:09.760]  pulled some really good ones. It's like a nice smattering
[22:09.760 --> 22:11.180]  of like, you know,
[22:11.540 --> 22:13.400]  actual strong questions
[22:13.400 --> 22:15.080]  and then wackadoo shit
[22:15.380 --> 22:16.680]  that's good to have answers to.
[22:16.980 --> 22:19.640]  This was the first insight into the
[22:19.640 --> 22:21.660]  entire sausage as opposed to like a
[22:21.660 --> 22:24.180]  There was even a company vote
[22:24.180 --> 22:26.000]  on a thing and I changed
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.840]  my opinion after we recorded it.
[22:28.080 --> 22:30.080]  I thought about what we talked about in the thing.
[22:30.480 --> 22:31.960]  Wow. I'm actually
[22:31.960 --> 22:33.740]  awesome. Very interesting.
[22:34.040 --> 22:35.880]  Very interesting. Guys, you gotta check that out on Sunday.
[22:36.280 --> 22:38.060]  I'm excited for the Sausage Talk. I'm very excited.
[22:39.380 --> 22:40.100]  Oh boy.
[22:40.640 --> 22:41.940]  I don't ever do that. Okay, well you gotta wait
[22:41.940 --> 22:43.580]  a second for me because I didn't- yeah, thanks.
[22:43.880 --> 22:45.840]  Oh God! You didn't call it! You just went!
[22:46.100 --> 22:47.480]  Oh, sorry. That's fine. That's fine.
[22:47.760 --> 22:48.760]  We're okay. Nah, we're good.
[22:48.760 --> 22:49.860]  We're all good.
[22:51.380 --> 22:53.460]  That's not the place to not go.
[22:53.840 --> 22:54.840]  Alright, guys. I appreciate
[22:54.840 --> 22:57.380]  there's a little bit of a delay. Yeah, wait a second.
[22:57.540 --> 22:59.160]  Like you said. You're getting close
[22:59.160 --> 23:01.240]  to the highest you've been so far.
[23:01.340 --> 23:03.280]  How are you feeling? Today. Great.
[23:03.380 --> 23:04.720]  Not ever. Yeah, today. Great.
[23:04.940 --> 23:07.500]  I'm feeling like at 22 minutes last time
[23:07.500 --> 23:08.680]  we were way further than this.
[23:09.480 --> 23:10.980]  I feel like somehow
[23:10.980 --> 23:13.160]  you might be right which is frustrating.
[23:14.140 --> 23:14.680]  I think you're right.
[23:15.340 --> 23:16.320]  Let's wake up.
[23:16.320 --> 23:17.860]  Everybody bunch up.
[23:19.160 --> 23:20.860]  Alright, let's wait for the next one.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.520]  Not this one. Not this one.
[23:22.580 --> 23:23.460]  Next time, now.
[23:24.940 --> 23:26.420]  Alright, we just passed our record.
[23:27.140 --> 23:27.920]  World first.
[23:28.320 --> 23:30.220]  Wait for this one. Right here.
[23:31.140 --> 23:31.640]  Alright, let it go.
[23:33.220 --> 23:34.020]  Oh boy.
[23:34.680 --> 23:36.400]  Oh boy. Perfect. We did it.
[23:36.560 --> 23:38.660]  Look at that, guys. You're flying right now.
[23:38.720 --> 23:39.820]  Perfect. Alright.
[23:40.580 --> 23:42.160]  What do we got next? Ladder?
[23:42.760 --> 23:43.160]  Ladder?
[23:44.900 --> 23:46.340]  We got ladder.
[23:47.700 --> 23:49.020]  You guys are doing a great job with the ladder.
[23:49.020 --> 23:50.880]  Oh boy. Hey, fantastic.
[23:51.640 --> 23:52.420]  Excellent climbing.
[23:52.540 --> 23:53.360]  A little swivel.
[23:54.600 --> 23:55.800]  Climbing skills on display.
[23:56.140 --> 23:58.260]  Okay. We had a bit of a...
[23:58.260 --> 23:59.900]  Jump at it when it's coming towards us, right?
[23:59.940 --> 24:00.800]  Not when it's going away?
[24:01.020 --> 24:03.560]  Like now, we would do it, but next time.
[24:03.720 --> 24:06.060]  I would say like right now, personally.
[24:06.060 --> 24:07.260]  Yeah, like now would be the next time.
[24:07.260 --> 24:09.740]  But what we don't want to do is jump past it.
[24:10.480 --> 24:12.000]  That's what we did last time.
[24:12.640 --> 24:14.180]  Okay, so let's all group up.
[24:14.980 --> 24:16.100]  Let's do it on this one, right?
[24:17.320 --> 24:18.960]  Okay. No, I'm not going to do it this time.
[24:19.140 --> 24:20.400]  We'll do it this time. I'm coming right here.
[24:21.440 --> 24:21.900]  Okay. Go.
[24:22.780 --> 24:24.100]  As I jump right over it.
[24:24.240 --> 24:26.400]  You jumped right over it.
[24:27.120 --> 24:28.420]  You jumped right over it.
[24:28.460 --> 24:30.300]  That's also the opposite of what I would have done.
[24:30.720 --> 24:32.660]  That's okay. We made it.
[24:32.860 --> 24:34.740]  You jumped so goddamn far.
[24:36.780 --> 24:37.580]  What's happening?
[24:37.800 --> 24:39.400]  Give me senseless gas!
[24:39.400 --> 24:41.460]  Geoff, get out the freaking...
[24:41.460 --> 24:43.840]  Okay, everyone calm down.
[24:46.080 --> 24:48.200]  Let's not eat up too much slack.
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.200]  You were in the middle of speaking and you just went.
[24:52.440 --> 24:55.020]  No, I said let's not eat up too much slack.
[24:55.180 --> 24:55.840]  It's close enough.
[24:56.260 --> 24:58.140]  We don't need to panic when we make it.
[24:58.280 --> 24:59.740]  If we make it, everything is fine.
[25:00.440 --> 25:02.180]  Yeah, and if we don't, we can't panic?
[25:02.440 --> 25:02.700]  Okay.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.240]  Everyone stop. Rules.
[25:06.860 --> 25:07.740]  Group huddle.
[25:08.240 --> 25:10.720]  Don't be freaking mumbling along
[25:10.720 --> 25:11.600]  and then suddenly jump.
[25:11.680 --> 25:12.500]  I've gotta be listening.
[25:12.740 --> 25:15.940]  If it is an easy jump, it's okay.
[25:16.020 --> 25:18.220]  We made it. We don't need to be mad about it.
[25:18.280 --> 25:19.480]  We all made it. We're here.
[25:19.780 --> 25:20.700]  Everything is fine.
[25:22.340 --> 25:23.440]  There's no issue.
[25:25.560 --> 25:27.460]  So now we just gotta jump over this.
[25:28.880 --> 25:29.980]  Okay, we're going.
[25:30.280 --> 25:31.500]  Okay, we gotta jump over it.
[25:32.560 --> 25:33.660]  And then do it again.
[25:34.100 --> 25:35.080]  Someone's getting tugged.
[25:35.080 --> 25:36.860]  I got tugged. You tugged me.
[25:37.200 --> 25:38.340]  I'm getting tugged.
[25:40.460 --> 25:43.200]  I don't think Geoff has made
[25:43.200 --> 25:44.800]  a single one of these.
[25:45.140 --> 25:46.500]  That's not helping.
[25:46.700 --> 25:48.040]  It doesn't help.
[25:48.100 --> 25:50.740]  I made them all, but you gotta help.
[25:51.040 --> 25:53.140]  I'm getting pulled left and right. It's not fair.
[25:53.600 --> 25:54.260]  I'm good though.
[25:54.520 --> 25:57.140]  I was the least.
[25:57.360 --> 25:57.980]  I was at the end.
[26:00.200 --> 26:02.000]  He's repeating what you're saying
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.240]  but he doesn't understand
[26:03.240 --> 26:04.460]  what it is that you said.
[26:05.740 --> 26:08.600]  Oh, the barrels of hate.
[26:08.860 --> 26:11.020]  Oh, wow.
[26:11.360 --> 26:12.600]  There we go.
[26:12.840 --> 26:15.360]  Look who made that first try. His name is Geoff.
[26:15.660 --> 26:16.800]  His name is Geoff.
[26:17.440 --> 26:18.180]  His name is Geoff.
[26:19.180 --> 26:20.920]  I thought his name was Lil' Geoffy.
[26:21.460 --> 26:22.160]  It's just Geoff?
[26:22.880 --> 26:24.100]  Lil' Geoffy.
[26:26.300 --> 26:27.660]  It's Lil' Geoffy when I'm
[26:27.660 --> 26:28.560]  a little stinker.
[26:28.560 --> 26:30.100]  Oh, God.
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.400]  When you're just sawy.
[26:33.340 --> 26:34.500]  Oh, Gavin.
[26:35.680 --> 26:38.160]  I mean, an insane move by you.
[26:38.340 --> 26:39.800]  You just said we're going.
[26:39.900 --> 26:41.580]  You said we're going if it's an easy jump.
[26:42.120 --> 26:43.800]  But we weren't all there.
[26:44.700 --> 26:46.720]  What the fuck, dude?
[26:46.980 --> 26:48.740]  I cannot believe you're
[26:48.740 --> 26:50.260]  You are
[26:50.960 --> 26:53.000]  the fucking villain of this story.
[26:53.160 --> 26:54.140]  You are Alan Rickman.
[26:55.180 --> 26:57.220]  I turned around and we were
[26:57.220 --> 26:59.060]  What a pointless way to die.
[26:59.060 --> 27:01.680]  I didn't have a moment to evaluate the easiness
[27:01.680 --> 27:03.720]  of it. You just went with no slack.
[27:06.060 --> 27:06.460]  Hey, Gavin.
[27:07.380 --> 27:08.360]  Also, you're not on the end.
[27:08.540 --> 27:09.680]  I thought it was an easy jump, dude.
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.640]  I think it probably was.
[27:14.380 --> 27:15.340]  You evaluated
[27:15.340 --> 27:16.500]  before anyone got there.
[27:16.920 --> 27:18.660]  We gotta wait until we can all evaluate.
[27:23.620 --> 27:25.160]  It's just a wild move by you,
[27:25.160 --> 27:26.020]  but hey, that's okay.
[27:26.680 --> 27:28.700]  Did Eric say he thought it was an easy jump?
[27:31.400 --> 27:32.120]  I'm watching
[27:33.560 --> 27:34.220]  Gavin's screen
[27:34.220 --> 27:35.780]  and it looked like an easy jump to me.
[27:36.400 --> 27:37.000]  Well, okay.
[27:37.140 --> 27:38.940]  So what did everyone want to talk about for that bit?
[27:39.560 --> 27:40.960]  We just didn't get there.
[27:41.020 --> 27:42.540]  It wasn't that I wanted to talk about it.
[27:42.600 --> 27:44.400]  I just didn't get a chance to see it.
[27:44.580 --> 27:46.120]  It was further ahead.
[27:47.040 --> 27:49.340]  I kind of wanted to open my eyes
[27:49.340 --> 27:50.260]  and just look at something.
[27:51.320 --> 27:52.540]  Yeah, Nick's eyes were still closed.
[27:52.540 --> 27:54.680]  Nick's eyes were so closed, dude.
[27:55.540 --> 27:56.420]  I was mid-blink.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.720]  I'll take responsibility for that.
[27:58.940 --> 27:59.560]  I muffed it.
[27:59.940 --> 28:01.740]  We're just gonna go.
[28:02.120 --> 28:04.080]  We need to stop and evaluate.
[28:04.500 --> 28:07.020]  If you need to call a hold on...
[28:07.020 --> 28:09.040]  Just make sure everyone's there first
[28:09.040 --> 28:10.480]  before doing it.
[28:10.540 --> 28:11.360]  You just did it.
[28:12.440 --> 28:15.040]  We were all just doing it
[28:15.040 --> 28:16.820]  for the last 60 seconds.
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.040]  But when you went,
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.420]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[28:19.420 --> 28:20.720]  What you doing to me?
[28:20.780 --> 28:22.840]  We were all standing looking at it.
[28:22.840 --> 28:24.160]  We were all there.
[28:24.920 --> 28:26.980]  You just walked up to a thing and went easy
[28:26.980 --> 28:29.040]  and then just did it and there was no slack.
[28:30.960 --> 28:31.760]  Those were not
[28:31.760 --> 28:33.500]  the same things that you and I did.
[28:35.740 --> 28:36.680]  This is fun.
[28:37.800 --> 28:39.420]  And that's okay, because hey,
[28:39.580 --> 28:40.360]  you're a wild card.
[28:40.860 --> 28:41.500]  We expect that.
[28:42.640 --> 28:44.320]  Guys, that's me.
[28:46.320 --> 28:47.520]  The chat's saying
[28:47.520 --> 28:48.580]  that that was an easy jump.
[28:49.060 --> 28:50.100]  I'm just letting you know what the chat's saying.
[28:50.500 --> 28:53.820]  I think it's probably right, but we just didn't get a chance to see it.
[28:54.180 --> 28:55.040]  I don't think Gavin's wrong.
[28:55.740 --> 28:56.980]  He just was a little quick on the draw.
[28:57.080 --> 28:57.700]  Where was everyone?
[28:58.520 --> 29:00.060]  I was trying to catch up to you.
[29:00.240 --> 29:01.880]  You were just ahead of us by quite a bit.
[29:02.180 --> 29:05.340]  The second dude in the chain
[29:05.340 --> 29:06.360]  was ahead of everybody else.
[29:09.760 --> 29:10.740]  You know what I'm hearing?
[29:11.240 --> 29:13.180]  Maybe Gavin should be first in the chain next time.
[29:13.860 --> 29:15.180]  You know what? You want to host, Gavin?
[29:15.980 --> 29:17.160]  You know, next time.
[29:17.560 --> 29:19.180]  Yeah, I'll sit out. Eric will come in.
[29:19.300 --> 29:19.680]  It'll be good.
[29:19.960 --> 29:21.180]  I'll sit out. I got it.
[29:21.880 --> 29:23.260]  No, Nick.
[29:24.580 --> 29:26.400]  If you're streaming it,
[29:26.460 --> 29:27.240]  you gotta do it.
[29:28.420 --> 29:30.900]  I'd be willing to hire four people
[29:30.900 --> 29:32.980]  to the company so we don't have to play.
[29:33.280 --> 29:34.320]  That's a good idea.
[29:34.660 --> 29:35.740]  I don't mind playing.
[29:36.060 --> 29:38.900]  What if we hired four people
[29:38.900 --> 29:40.940]  and coached them on this?
[29:41.580 --> 29:42.820]  That sounds like hell.
[29:42.820 --> 29:45.880]  Four people who've never played a video game.
[29:46.260 --> 29:46.640]  Yes.
[29:46.840 --> 29:48.080]  And then we coach them
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.780]  on how to do this.
[29:50.660 --> 29:52.080]  Everyone's mom has to play.
[29:56.260 --> 29:58.360]  We're not getting through the first section.
[30:00.540 --> 30:02.200]  They're not getting on the elevator.
[30:06.100 --> 30:08.880]  It would be a struggle to get to the elevator.
[30:09.160 --> 30:09.420]  Yeah.
[30:13.420 --> 30:14.680]  There we go.
[30:14.780 --> 30:16.140]  You guys are bunched up pretty good here.
[30:16.200 --> 30:18.020]  Yeah, this is all easy.
[30:18.260 --> 30:18.980]  We're doing great.
[30:21.360 --> 30:22.320]  Doing great!
[30:23.580 --> 30:24.540]  Doing fantastic.
[30:25.200 --> 30:26.640]  My mom has high blood pressure.
[30:26.780 --> 30:27.980]  Do you think this game is for her?
[30:29.620 --> 30:30.060]  Yes.
[30:30.660 --> 30:31.140]  Cool.
[30:33.600 --> 30:34.460]  Who's jumping?
[30:34.960 --> 30:36.940]  To have one of those
[30:36.940 --> 30:38.360]  blood pressure cuffs put on?
[30:39.120 --> 30:40.080]  Everybody but Eric.
[30:40.080 --> 30:42.020]  I just meant Eric.
[30:43.060 --> 30:43.880]  Alright, wait.
[30:44.080 --> 30:44.500]  Not this one.
[30:46.420 --> 30:46.940]  Suddenly
[30:47.900 --> 30:49.020]  this was hard.
[30:50.080 --> 30:51.080]  Andrew fell.
[30:51.380 --> 30:52.780]  I wasn't there.
[30:53.080 --> 30:56.140]  We would have been tagging someone
[30:56.140 --> 30:56.500]  along.
[30:58.360 --> 30:59.460]  No, it was easy.
[31:00.060 --> 31:02.040]  It wasn't easy because you didn't
[31:02.040 --> 31:02.760]  have boots on the ground.
[31:02.880 --> 31:04.980]  I just didn't get enough air on the trampoline.
[31:05.340 --> 31:06.500]  I just didn't get enough momentum.
[31:08.260 --> 31:09.120]  If that's
[31:09.120 --> 31:10.440]  what you'd like it to be, then sure.
[31:10.540 --> 31:12.260]  If it was easy, you would have made it.
[31:12.780 --> 31:13.800]  That's right, Geoff.
[31:13.960 --> 31:15.200]  You're 100% correct.
[31:15.920 --> 31:18.040]  Now, teamwork on this one.
[31:19.980 --> 31:20.640]  Yep, just gotta
[31:20.640 --> 31:21.500]  sync up again.
[31:22.380 --> 31:24.000]  Feeling pretty good about this spot.
[31:24.840 --> 31:24.960]  Nope.
[31:26.500 --> 31:27.460]  We didn't make it.
[31:28.040 --> 31:29.540]  No, we got it.
[31:31.020 --> 31:31.980]  We got it.
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.700]  Why is everyone
[31:34.700 --> 31:36.220]  No, who went back?
[31:36.700 --> 31:37.900]  That's okay. Pull me up.
[31:38.300 --> 31:39.760]  I got it. I got it.
[31:39.880 --> 31:40.920]  Oh my God.
[31:42.940 --> 31:44.140]  Jesus Christ.
[31:44.460 --> 31:46.040]  Don't move.
[31:49.340 --> 31:50.500]  Oh, fuck it.
[31:51.020 --> 31:52.580]  What are you doing?
[31:52.680 --> 31:53.600]  Geoff saved the day.
[31:53.900 --> 31:55.560]  I'm trying to hold on.
[31:57.100 --> 31:58.300]  Everyone get on the
[31:58.300 --> 31:59.180]  frickin' ladder.
[32:01.160 --> 32:02.620]  Little Jesse grabbed
[32:02.620 --> 32:03.300]  the ladder.
[32:03.300 --> 32:05.080]  Little Jesse
[32:05.080 --> 32:06.100]  get it.
[32:07.200 --> 32:08.040]  Okay.
[32:09.220 --> 32:10.460]  That was ridiculous.
[32:10.920 --> 32:14.400]  Oh my God.
[32:15.060 --> 32:17.220]  Are we ready?
[32:17.840 --> 32:18.780]  That was insane.
[32:19.040 --> 32:21.160]  That was mid-brag
[32:21.160 --> 32:22.280]  about how he'd saved the day.
[32:22.280 --> 32:23.720]  Stop. Stop. Stop.
[32:24.560 --> 32:25.040]  Who?
[32:27.220 --> 32:28.140]  No, it was not.
[32:28.860 --> 32:31.620]  It was not.
[32:31.620 --> 32:32.020]  It was not me.
[32:33.200 --> 32:34.000]  Okay, everyone
[32:35.480 --> 32:36.960]  It's okay. It was me.
[32:37.060 --> 32:38.260]  If it was me, that's it.
[32:38.480 --> 32:40.940]  There goes Nick off the side.
[32:42.180 --> 32:43.640]  Been waiting for that to
[32:43.640 --> 32:45.480]  happen every time you guys have been on a ladder.
[32:47.920 --> 32:49.640]  Hey, Geoff, is this part hard?
[32:49.820 --> 32:50.240]  Do you need a minute?
[32:51.540 --> 32:51.940]  Yeah.
[32:53.300 --> 32:54.040]  It's hard.
[32:54.720 --> 32:56.500]  You know what? That was me in that case.
[32:56.620 --> 32:57.680]  I didn't think it was.
[32:57.680 --> 32:57.980]  Is this too high?
[32:58.920 --> 33:00.620]  Oh, Nick.
[33:01.000 --> 33:02.040]  I am gonna lose.
[33:03.300 --> 33:06.000]  I am gonna shit my bed.
[33:06.180 --> 33:07.160]  I'm not even in my bedroom.
[33:07.260 --> 33:08.500]  I'm gonna go shit on my bed.
[33:10.260 --> 33:11.100]  Pull me up.
[33:11.500 --> 33:12.380]  Pull me up, please.
[33:13.020 --> 33:14.400]  They pulled me down.
[33:16.440 --> 33:17.220]  I'm trying my fucking best.
[33:17.660 --> 33:19.880]  I'm trying my fucking best with this group.
[33:20.240 --> 33:21.720]  I'm doing my goddamn best.
[33:22.340 --> 33:23.320]  Alright, we're on the ladder.
[33:23.860 --> 33:24.680]  Holy shit.
[33:24.680 --> 33:26.820]  How are you on the end of the ladder, Gavin?
[33:26.880 --> 33:27.540]  That was crazy.
[33:28.080 --> 33:28.740]  I don't know, Geoff.
[33:29.160 --> 33:32.600]  Geoff is like a wrecking ball.
[33:35.580 --> 33:36.020]  Okay.
[33:40.100 --> 33:40.980]  Now, everyone...
[33:40.980 --> 33:41.860]  Stop and wait.
[33:44.160 --> 33:44.760]  I accept my
[33:44.760 --> 33:45.360]  responsibility to go.
[33:48.040 --> 33:50.120]  I did it last time. Alright, stop.
[33:50.440 --> 33:50.760]  Don't go.
[33:54.680 --> 33:55.100]  Now.
[33:56.740 --> 33:57.620]  Good job.
[33:58.280 --> 34:00.620]  Whoever's red is a bit low, but alright.
[34:01.100 --> 34:01.560]  That's Geoff.
[34:03.620 --> 34:05.300]  What will he do next?
[34:12.440 --> 34:14.300]  There goes Nick off the side again.
[34:15.520 --> 34:16.840]  He was the only guy
[34:16.840 --> 34:18.760]  to do it last time also, and I just
[34:18.760 --> 34:20.860]  keep waiting for it on this time, and he's
[34:20.860 --> 34:21.280]  done it twice.
[34:22.200 --> 34:24.080]  I was laughing so hard, I forgot you could do it.
[34:24.080 --> 34:25.380]  That's alright, that's on me.
[34:25.960 --> 34:27.000]  Oh my god.
[34:27.660 --> 34:29.260]  Alright, who's calling it out this time, guys?
[34:29.820 --> 34:30.060]  Gavin.
[34:31.800 --> 34:33.960]  Why would I be the one? I'm the second in the chain.
[34:34.680 --> 34:36.020]  Yeah, it should be one of the two
[34:36.020 --> 34:36.420]  leads.
[34:37.760 --> 34:39.560]  Oh god. It should be Andrew.
[34:40.260 --> 34:41.860]  Okay, we're gonna wait.
[34:42.460 --> 34:43.140]  Did you say one?
[34:43.520 --> 34:45.460]  3, 2, 1, go.
[34:47.980 --> 34:49.180]  Geoff overshot it.
[34:49.580 --> 34:51.640]  I'm gonna kill
[34:51.640 --> 34:53.100]  I'm gonna kill a lot of you.
[34:54.320 --> 34:55.780]  Geoff overshot it, is that what happened?
[34:56.500 --> 34:57.460]  I didn't undershoot it.
[34:57.500 --> 34:59.260]  Oh, I'm sorry, it was Andrew.
[34:59.420 --> 35:00.340]  I apologize, Nick.
[35:00.880 --> 35:01.520]  Andrew, why?
[35:03.940 --> 35:05.440]  It's a good idea.
[35:05.660 --> 35:07.760]  Hey, Andrew, big brain move.
[35:07.940 --> 35:08.840]  Wouldn't have thought to do that.
[35:09.880 --> 35:10.800]  Great brain move.
[35:12.280 --> 35:13.560]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[35:15.880 --> 35:16.520]  Oh, Geoff.
[35:17.220 --> 35:18.260]  Oh, little Geoffy.
[35:18.260 --> 35:20.440]  Oh, someone just ejected.
[35:21.220 --> 35:21.820]  That was me.
[35:21.920 --> 35:23.700]  Just like a bullet in a gun.
[35:24.220 --> 35:24.700]  Geoff.
[35:26.120 --> 35:27.560]  I don't know what's going on.
[35:28.280 --> 35:29.700]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[35:30.380 --> 35:31.640]  We'll do it next time.
[35:31.980 --> 35:32.500]  Next one.
[35:33.540 --> 35:35.280]  This is what we were talking about last time.
[35:36.140 --> 35:37.400]  Geoff, I need you.
[35:37.680 --> 35:38.520]  Geoff, you need a minute.
[35:39.920 --> 35:41.300]  Do you want to take a break?
[35:42.280 --> 35:43.260]  Oh my god.
[35:45.580 --> 35:45.860]  Okay.
[35:46.920 --> 35:47.860]  It's quick jumps.
[35:47.860 --> 35:50.020]  You don't have to move left or right.
[35:50.120 --> 35:50.940]  You just have to jump.
[35:55.860 --> 35:56.540]  Barrels of hate.
[35:57.540 --> 35:57.980]  Barrels of hate.
[36:00.520 --> 36:01.400]  Oh my god.
[36:02.040 --> 36:03.160]  Wow, good moves, guys.
[36:03.980 --> 36:04.360]  GG.
[36:06.280 --> 36:07.300]  For god's sake.
[36:07.520 --> 36:09.160]  So this next part, Nick, did you go off the side of the ladder?
[36:10.400 --> 36:11.680]  No, I just didn't get on it.
[36:13.960 --> 36:14.360]  So...
[36:14.360 --> 36:15.640]  Alright, let's...
[36:15.640 --> 36:18.640]  I feel like I just...
[36:18.640 --> 36:20.600]  I feel like I just got out of a swimming pool.
[36:20.720 --> 36:21.700]  With all my clothes on.
[36:23.220 --> 36:24.740]  Alright, we all see it now.
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.280]  I didn't even know what was happening.
[36:26.280 --> 36:27.060]  Alright, I see it now.
[36:27.140 --> 36:27.720]  Go, go, go.
[36:30.160 --> 36:31.300]  Easy, baby stuff.
[36:31.820 --> 36:34.640]  And that's all Gavin was saying.
[36:35.560 --> 36:35.740]  Yeah.
[36:36.040 --> 36:36.920]  Alright, let's go jump.
[36:37.680 --> 36:38.460]  Oh my god.
[36:38.460 --> 36:39.160]  Alright.
[36:41.100 --> 36:41.980]  Oh god.
[36:42.520 --> 36:42.860]  Okay.
[36:44.260 --> 36:46.420]  Don't even know where they're going.
[36:46.420 --> 36:48.140]  Don't even know where they're going.
[36:48.480 --> 36:50.580]  That was mental.
[36:51.040 --> 36:52.400]  With falling off bits,
[36:52.480 --> 36:54.320]  we didn't even notice the first time.
[36:54.600 --> 36:55.480]  What was that?
[36:56.820 --> 36:57.800]  I don't know.
[36:58.800 --> 36:59.360]  We...
[37:01.180 --> 37:01.740]  We...
[37:01.740 --> 37:02.980]  Okay, here's what happened.
[37:03.220 --> 37:04.620]  I pieced it together.
[37:04.620 --> 37:06.420]  We jumped on the trampoline,
[37:07.100 --> 37:09.420]  and two of us landed on the second trampoline,
[37:09.500 --> 37:11.000]  but two of us landed on the platform
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.020]  next to it.
[37:12.240 --> 37:13.960]  So only two of us got the proper bounce.
[37:14.340 --> 37:17.040]  So when we pulled, we didn't have enough
[37:17.520 --> 37:19.020]  velocity to get to the next spot.
[37:19.780 --> 37:21.320]  So all of us need to land.
[37:21.480 --> 37:22.800]  So if we hit that
[37:22.800 --> 37:24.900]  again, and only two of us are on it,
[37:25.500 --> 37:27.160]  we just need to hold up on that second one.
[37:27.340 --> 37:29.140]  How do we know that only two of us are going to land on it?
[37:29.240 --> 37:29.980]  We'll scream,
[37:30.100 --> 37:30.640]  We're not on it!
[37:30.640 --> 37:31.300]  We're not on it!
[37:33.640 --> 37:34.480]  According to
[37:34.980 --> 37:36.840]  our mods, the person that made you guys
[37:36.840 --> 37:38.880]  fall was Geoff, and a new prediction
[37:38.880 --> 37:39.880]  is coming. Thank you so much.
[37:40.020 --> 37:42.700]  I don't know how that's possible, but
[37:43.120 --> 37:43.740]  you know.
[37:44.260 --> 37:45.420]  That was gravity.
[37:45.540 --> 37:47.600]  Thank you DigReaper for 25 gifted.
[37:48.420 --> 37:48.740]  Wow!
[37:51.260 --> 37:51.680]  DigReaper.
[37:52.540 --> 37:54.460]  You're a real motherfucker. Thank you.
[37:54.640 --> 37:55.940]  DigReaper, you're a real motherfucker.
[37:56.080 --> 37:57.380]  Hey, DigReaper, you're a real motherfucker.
[37:58.380 --> 37:59.380]  You're the realest.
[38:00.560 --> 38:02.160]  There's a lot to be happy about.
[38:03.320 --> 38:03.880]  SpecterPanzer7
[38:03.880 --> 38:05.680]  used a prime sub. You're a motherfucker too.
[38:05.740 --> 38:06.460]  That's okay.
[38:06.460 --> 38:09.760]  Who pulled me off?
[38:10.300 --> 38:11.980]  You pulled yourself off!
[38:12.180 --> 38:12.580]  No!
[38:13.280 --> 38:14.400]  That was you.
[38:14.400 --> 38:15.820]  That was not my fault.
[38:16.360 --> 38:18.820]  I didn't have enough slack to do.
[38:19.300 --> 38:20.080]  No, that was you.
[38:20.460 --> 38:22.540]  And everyone just
[38:23.180 --> 38:24.480]  standing around watching him.
[38:24.480 --> 38:26.120]  Oh my god!
[38:27.440 --> 38:28.500]  Guys, we're not...
[38:29.560 --> 38:30.520]  You slow
[38:32.160 --> 38:33.120]  fucking slowbies.
[38:33.840 --> 38:34.520]  When we get to this
[38:34.520 --> 38:36.180]  next bit, can we do a quick test?
[38:36.360 --> 38:36.940]  I want to try something.
[38:37.460 --> 38:39.580]  Dude, I'm in the middle of a young salad.
[38:40.260 --> 38:42.360]  It's a fucking suck salad
[38:42.360 --> 38:44.620]  is what it is. It's a bunch of slow
[38:44.620 --> 38:46.500]  footed motherfuckers not going.
[38:47.240 --> 38:48.380]  Alright, fast leader.
[38:48.380 --> 38:50.160]  The guy hanging off the side.
[38:50.460 --> 38:51.840]  I am because I was too fast.
[38:51.840 --> 38:53.620]  Because I can literally get pulled back
[38:53.620 --> 38:54.540]  by your slow asses.
[38:54.620 --> 38:57.200]  I want to test something.
[38:58.940 --> 38:59.800]  Andrew, jump
[38:59.800 --> 39:01.780]  off the ledge right here. I'm going to stand
[39:01.780 --> 39:03.800]  right here. See if you can pull yourself up while you're looking
[39:03.800 --> 39:04.120]  at me.
[39:05.680 --> 39:07.540]  I just want to see if this is a mechanic
[39:07.540 --> 39:09.740]  that we can use. It's not letting me even grab
[39:09.740 --> 39:11.780]  myself. You need to look up.
[39:12.020 --> 39:13.700]  Alright. I need to look up?
[39:14.280 --> 39:15.360]  You need to look at who you're pulling.
[39:16.420 --> 39:17.920]  I'm looking at him. Look at me and see if you can pull.
[39:19.640 --> 39:20.260]  No, I'm not.
[39:20.260 --> 39:21.740]  I should be giving you the prompt to pull.
[39:22.000 --> 39:22.880]  Is that a thing?
[39:23.400 --> 39:26.460]  Can you pull? Not really.
[39:27.220 --> 39:28.020]  Does it say
[39:28.020 --> 39:28.640]  e-pull?
[39:29.860 --> 39:32.280]  It did for a second. Why don't you do it
[39:32.280 --> 39:33.640]  with me? Why don't you try, Gavin?
[39:34.220 --> 39:36.280]  Yeah, that way I can... Oh, that's a good idea.
[39:37.620 --> 39:38.180]  I'm pulling
[39:38.180 --> 39:40.380]  to me or Geoff. Oh, so there is a pull.
[39:41.760 --> 39:42.340]  So you
[39:42.340 --> 39:43.420]  can pull while you're hanging.
[39:43.660 --> 39:46.340]  I didn't let anything because Geoff
[39:46.340 --> 39:47.700]  was pulling. No, no, no.
[39:48.140 --> 39:49.680]  Weren't you pulling your own
[39:49.680 --> 39:50.120]  chain, Gavin?
[39:51.280 --> 39:52.620]  Do it again.
[39:54.400 --> 39:55.060]  Do it again.
[39:55.180 --> 39:59.240]  Do it again.
[39:59.740 --> 40:01.460]  Okay, so Nick is there.
[40:01.740 --> 40:03.040]  No one is pulling Nick.
[40:03.800 --> 40:04.860]  Andrew took a dive.
[40:05.380 --> 40:05.840]  Oh, I got pulled.
[40:08.040 --> 40:09.560]  Okay, so I don't think
[40:09.560 --> 40:11.480]  that works then. The person standing up top
[40:11.480 --> 40:13.200]  needs to be the one pulling. Because if you're pulling
[40:13.600 --> 40:15.500]  and you're not anchored, you're going to yank them down.
[40:16.640 --> 40:17.320]  Alright, sweet.
[40:17.420 --> 40:19.120]  Just making sure. Somebody in the chat said that
[40:19.120 --> 40:21.420]  you could pull up. Oh my god.
[40:21.800 --> 40:23.500]  Oh my god.
[40:24.280 --> 40:25.500]  Now if I wasn't
[40:25.500 --> 40:27.520]  a team guy, this would be where I'd call out
[40:27.520 --> 40:28.920]  you're going too slow.
[40:29.380 --> 40:30.960]  Why aren't you going fast enough, Geoff?
[40:31.560 --> 40:33.500]  Let's be faster. Me?
[40:33.920 --> 40:35.580]  I'm fucking pulling every time
[40:35.580 --> 40:37.520]  I try to go forward, I get yanked back by you
[40:37.520 --> 40:39.220]  slow motherfuckers.
[40:39.340 --> 40:41.300]  Geoff, I didn't say that. I'm not saying that.
[40:41.400 --> 40:42.980]  He said if. Yeah, I wasn't.
[40:42.980 --> 40:44.220]  That's what I was saying.
[40:45.540 --> 40:47.160]  But I am a team guy, so I'm not saying that.
[40:47.180 --> 40:49.020]  He's the team guy. Yeah, he's team guy.
[40:49.220 --> 40:50.760]  Resident regulation team guy.
[40:51.240 --> 40:51.720]  You know what?
[40:52.940 --> 40:54.960]  I'm going to stand back. I'm going to say
[40:54.960 --> 40:56.620]  Andrew's the first.
[40:56.920 --> 40:58.300]  Andrew is
[40:59.100 --> 41:01.120]  leading and Geoff jumped off the edge.
[41:01.420 --> 41:03.020]  Andrew's the first part of the
[41:03.020 --> 41:04.480]  chain. He's going. You got it.
[41:04.820 --> 41:05.940]  I'm not first? Okay, that's fine.
[41:07.100 --> 41:08.960]  And everybody but Andrew went on that.
[41:09.640 --> 41:10.420]  Yeah, that was weird.
[41:10.420 --> 41:12.420]  We were all lined up and then just...
[41:13.840 --> 41:14.420]  And then
[41:14.420 --> 41:15.440]  Geoff and Gavin jumped.
[41:19.400 --> 41:20.320]  We're all good. We're
[41:20.320 --> 41:21.120]  hitting new heights.
[41:22.100 --> 41:24.520]  We just had a little trampoline issue. We corrected
[41:24.520 --> 41:26.500]  what we'll do next time if that happens
[41:26.500 --> 41:28.320]  again. We're making progress.
[41:28.740 --> 41:29.220]  We're learning.
[41:30.120 --> 41:31.580]  Oh, we're not even on the bone bit yet.
[41:33.220 --> 41:33.840]  We're not.
[41:34.420 --> 41:35.720]  We got to get up on that bone.
[41:36.240 --> 41:38.080]  And you're not good at the bone bit, Gavin.
[41:38.520 --> 41:39.900]  I get scared on the bone bit.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.100]  Oh my god.
[41:44.040 --> 41:44.920]  Oh boy.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.140]  How you feeling, big dog?
[41:51.560 --> 41:52.200]  Yeah, how are
[41:52.200 --> 41:53.720]  you feeling, Eric? I'm
[41:53.720 --> 41:55.960]  feeling good. I'm watching the chat.
[41:56.060 --> 41:56.980]  I'm talking to people.
[41:57.960 --> 41:59.700]  When we get the big
[41:59.700 --> 42:01.960]  sub drive thing, I'm trying to call people out.
[42:02.060 --> 42:03.920]  But I'm trying to let you guys sort of talk
[42:03.920 --> 42:06.020]  through your stuff. Yeah, call those motherfuckers out. Don't let them
[42:06.020 --> 42:07.840]  get away with it. Oh no, I'm letting people know if they're
[42:07.840 --> 42:10.000]  motherfuckers in the chat. You call them out on their
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.220]  shit. I'm letting them know in the chat
[42:12.220 --> 42:13.720]  that we really appreciate them and everything.
[42:13.880 --> 42:15.800]  We see a lot of corn cats. Corn cats rise up.
[42:16.160 --> 42:17.800]  We are seeing some piss rats. Piss rats
[42:17.800 --> 42:20.180]  go down the toilet, but corn cats rise up.
[42:20.640 --> 42:21.760]  So, it's been good.
[42:22.940 --> 42:23.920]  Piss goes in the toilet.
[42:24.980 --> 42:25.940]  Piss goes in the toilet,
[42:26.080 --> 42:26.300]  guys.
[42:28.260 --> 42:29.080]  Oh shit, really?
[42:30.440 --> 42:31.320]  Oh fuck.
[42:33.980 --> 42:35.060]  Piss goes in the toilet.
[42:35.600 --> 42:36.220]  Huh? What?
[42:37.220 --> 42:38.220]  What's the sink for?
[42:38.540 --> 42:41.260]  What would be the weirdest place to find piss? I think a tube
[42:41.260 --> 42:41.860]  of toothpaste.
[42:42.920 --> 42:45.220]  Like you squeeze it out and piss just comes out?
[42:46.660 --> 42:47.300]  Tons of
[42:47.300 --> 42:48.960]  piss. You'd have to like
[42:48.960 --> 42:50.880]  fill a tub or
[42:50.880 --> 42:52.400]  a bucket. I think
[42:53.320 --> 42:54.540]  shampoo would be bad.
[42:55.420 --> 42:56.600]  Yeah, I don't think I'd notice.
[42:57.280 --> 42:58.540]  Cause you'd put it like on your head
[42:58.540 --> 43:00.360]  and you'd be like, that's runny shampoo.
[43:00.780 --> 43:02.560]  And then you'd be like, oh no, it smells like, oh no
[43:02.560 --> 43:02.960]  it is.
[43:04.940 --> 43:06.360]  What if it's like your contact
[43:06.360 --> 43:08.020]  solution? That'd be bad.
[43:08.140 --> 43:10.740]  You've already sprayed it on your contacts and you don't even know.
[43:11.240 --> 43:12.600]  You're just like, oh, contact solution's
[43:12.600 --> 43:14.340]  warm and it's piss. Alright, next one.
[43:14.920 --> 43:15.100]  Yup.
[43:17.620 --> 43:18.640]  Perfect. Great job.
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.520]  Guys, you guys are flying. This part's
[43:20.520 --> 43:21.020]  easy.
[43:22.460 --> 43:24.340]  Making it through consistently.
[43:26.600 --> 43:28.760]  I like seeing a bunch of people fall occasionally.
[43:30.940 --> 43:32.680]  I don't like to hear you say that.
[43:33.180 --> 43:34.080]  Just the other people.
[43:34.220 --> 43:36.580]  The people who aren't us. Oh, other
[43:36.580 --> 43:38.620]  people. Okay. Yeah, you see them sometimes.
[43:43.460 --> 43:44.440]  Alright, chill.
[43:45.280 --> 43:47.140]  Everyone's bean. Get your bean nice
[43:47.140 --> 43:48.020]  and cold. Yup.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.280]  No, no, no, no.
[43:50.340 --> 43:53.080]  Wait, wait, wait.
[43:53.100 --> 43:54.560]  Good communication, Gavin. That was good.
[43:55.720 --> 43:56.940]  Gavin, that was perfect.
[43:56.940 --> 43:58.160]  Yeah, that was a leader move. Well done.
[43:58.340 --> 43:59.880]  That was a classic Cyclops. Way to go.
[44:00.620 --> 44:02.940]  It's weird because you're in second place, but uh...
[44:03.600 --> 44:04.360]  Well, I think
[44:04.880 --> 44:06.640]  when the two ends didn't come through on it,
[44:06.700 --> 44:08.340]  I think it's just like somebody had to step up.
[44:08.960 --> 44:10.580]  Look, when the zero's slack
[44:10.580 --> 44:12.160]  and everyone's on a ladder, everyone's the leader.
[44:12.480 --> 44:12.680]  Yeah.
[44:14.440 --> 44:14.960]  Geoff's at the bottom.
[44:22.220 --> 44:23.740]  Oh my god, I love it.
[44:24.460 --> 44:25.320]  Oh, alright.
[44:25.500 --> 44:26.840]  Don't fuck this one up.
[44:27.340 --> 44:28.660]  Alright, who's calling it? Yeah, okay.
[44:29.280 --> 44:29.860]  Probably the leader.
[44:31.780 --> 44:32.040]  Yeah.
[44:35.650 --> 44:36.570]  Is that anyone?
[44:37.730 --> 44:38.870]  I don't think it's Andrew.
[44:40.030 --> 44:40.750]  They're referring to you.
[44:40.790 --> 44:42.130]  Well, I don't want to be. Now!
[44:43.110 --> 44:43.490]  Jesus!
[44:46.330 --> 44:47.910]  Oh my god.
[44:48.310 --> 44:48.790]  Jesus!
[44:50.130 --> 44:51.610]  No, no, no.
[44:52.130 --> 44:53.990]  No, no, no.
[44:53.990 --> 44:56.130]  You better start calling people, Geoff.
[44:56.250 --> 44:57.490]  Nailed it. Nailed it.
[44:57.750 --> 44:59.210]  Fucking nailed it.
[44:59.390 --> 45:00.230]  You're welcome.
[45:02.270 --> 45:04.050]  Remember how I messed that jump up
[45:04.050 --> 45:06.050]  a bunch every time? Didn't mess it up that time,
[45:06.090 --> 45:06.410]  did I?
[45:07.370 --> 45:08.690]  Fucking nailed it.
[45:09.330 --> 45:10.330]  That's leadership right there.
[45:11.790 --> 45:12.530]  Yeah, that was great.
[45:13.110 --> 45:14.230]  Only made it once.
[45:15.970 --> 45:17.590]  The one time that mattered.
[45:17.790 --> 45:18.110]  That's right.
[45:19.570 --> 45:21.070]  You can just jump.
[45:21.070 --> 45:22.890]  Just space only, and it's fine.
[45:23.550 --> 45:25.250]  It's the only thing you gotta do.
[45:25.510 --> 45:26.190]  Just hit that space.
[45:27.170 --> 45:28.130]  Don't forget about it.
[45:28.330 --> 45:30.350]  Don't forget about it. You just hit space.
[45:31.810 --> 45:33.130]  Archie, I don't need that cracker.
[45:33.350 --> 45:33.710]  Uh oh.
[45:36.270 --> 45:36.710]  No!
[45:37.210 --> 45:39.050]  Nick is being attacked by his kid.
[45:40.990 --> 45:41.990]  Okay, we did it.
[45:43.150 --> 45:45.330]  My kid just tried to put a Ritz cracker
[45:45.330 --> 45:45.770]  in my mouth.
[45:47.170 --> 45:48.770]  You should've just eaten the cracker.
[45:48.770 --> 45:51.110]  That was some of the worst cracker timing
[45:51.110 --> 45:51.850]  I've ever heard of.
[45:53.710 --> 45:54.990]  I'm in the middle
[45:54.990 --> 45:56.770]  of two areas. Can you just let me...
[45:58.630 --> 46:00.150]  We're trying not to fall, buddy.
[46:00.230 --> 46:02.010]  Gavin, you're gonna love
[46:02.870 --> 46:04.390]  being in the front or the back eventually.
[46:04.710 --> 46:05.230]  It's gonna be great.
[46:05.710 --> 46:07.130]  I'll tell you all about it later, okay?
[46:09.970 --> 46:11.870]  We need a cracker timeout.
[46:12.930 --> 46:14.830]  When you're older, I want you to watch
[46:14.830 --> 46:15.390]  this sun.
[46:15.390 --> 46:16.010]  Here we go.
[46:16.870 --> 46:17.350]  Ready?
[46:19.670 --> 46:22.570]  Oh, Gavin, what happened?
[46:23.250 --> 46:24.590]  I didn't jump, I was just pulled.
[46:24.870 --> 46:25.330]  Ready?
[46:26.930 --> 46:27.370]  I am.
[46:28.410 --> 46:28.890]  Again?
[46:31.370 --> 46:33.410]  I was pulled off.
[46:33.530 --> 46:35.370]  I was yanked off. Who yanked me off?
[46:35.470 --> 46:36.090]  Why yank me?
[46:37.010 --> 46:39.690]  I'm sprinting forward. I'm trying to pull you all up.
[46:40.410 --> 46:41.070]  Come on!
[46:41.110 --> 46:43.530]  You don't have to swing about like a giant...
[46:43.530 --> 46:46.210]  I'm getting pulled by you guys!
[46:47.790 --> 46:49.390]  We're losing momentum!
[46:50.330 --> 46:50.970]  Pull us up!
[46:51.430 --> 46:53.570]  Geoff, don't pull! What are you pulling me for?
[46:53.910 --> 46:55.910]  Jesus, stop whatever you're doing!
[46:56.130 --> 46:58.050]  It was Geoff at the bottom
[46:58.050 --> 47:00.290]  trying to just pull everyone down.
[47:01.090 --> 47:02.250]  Were you doing that the whole time?
[47:03.070 --> 47:04.490]  Geoff, you son of a bitch!
[47:14.050 --> 47:14.850]  God damn!
[47:18.750 --> 47:20.490]  Geoff's at the bottom of the chain being like,
[47:20.570 --> 47:23.090]  I'm gonna be first up, guys! Don't worry!
[47:25.310 --> 47:27.370]  Okay, we're going, we're going, we're going.
[47:30.630 --> 47:32.650]  So what are the rules for this?
[47:32.750 --> 47:34.850]  We jump on the platform and then on the trampoline?
[47:35.150 --> 47:36.730]  Let's go on the platform first,
[47:37.090 --> 47:38.010]  and then wait a second.
[47:38.870 --> 47:39.310]  Then wait.
[47:39.310 --> 47:39.990]  Alright.
[47:40.690 --> 47:41.570]  Everyone ready?
[47:44.970 --> 47:49.450]  3, 2, 1, jump!
[47:50.230 --> 47:50.610]  Good.
[47:51.630 --> 47:52.510]  Now land on this one.
[47:52.950 --> 47:55.570]  Someone didn't land on the trampoline.
[47:57.510 --> 47:58.510]  Someone is...
[47:58.510 --> 48:01.010]  Okay. Naming their names.
[48:01.350 --> 48:02.670]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[48:02.790 --> 48:03.730]  Okay, that's gone.
[48:04.130 --> 48:05.850]  We need to do a count off on that one.
[48:06.550 --> 48:07.570]  No worries.
[48:08.030 --> 48:10.170]  Can we just wait and collect ourselves?
[48:10.350 --> 48:10.810]  Get a drink?
[48:11.390 --> 48:13.230]  I think you have to hold jump.
[48:13.450 --> 48:16.630]  I think you hold jump to hang on to it.
[48:17.050 --> 48:17.570]  On 3.
[48:18.130 --> 48:20.090]  1, 2, 3, hold!
[48:20.810 --> 48:21.550]  It's not that.
[48:21.870 --> 48:22.650]  Andrew got it!
[48:23.990 --> 48:26.210]  So Andrew's just gonna carry us.
[48:26.250 --> 48:27.390]  Have a look at him, Gavin.
[48:27.550 --> 48:28.290]  How's he look?
[48:29.470 --> 48:30.010]  Powerful.
[48:30.950 --> 48:31.490]  Strong.
[48:31.490 --> 48:32.670]  Nick's pulling for some reason.
[48:32.890 --> 48:34.930]  Geoff, what if you just start pulling from the bottom?
[48:35.190 --> 48:36.410]  I can. I've been yelled at.
[48:37.950 --> 48:39.530]  I don't want to be too funny.
[48:39.870 --> 48:40.490]  People get upset.
[48:46.030 --> 48:46.930]  Oh, man.
[48:47.830 --> 48:49.310]  Oh, I just...
[48:49.310 --> 48:50.090]  Oh, it's so good.
[48:51.630 --> 48:52.070]  Okay.
[48:54.230 --> 48:55.010]  We did it!
[48:55.030 --> 48:56.210]  We made it to the car!
[48:56.550 --> 48:56.970]  Yeah!
[48:56.970 --> 48:57.570]  Yeah!
[48:58.950 --> 49:00.470]  Hang on, you gotta pull Geoff up.
[49:00.590 --> 49:01.570]  I'm up. I'm here.
[49:02.330 --> 49:04.490]  Is someone just, whenever I launch this game,
[49:04.650 --> 49:05.910]  just turning off my AC?
[49:06.330 --> 49:07.450]  I don't understand it.
[49:07.750 --> 49:08.750]  Yeah, that's shmee mode.
[49:10.350 --> 49:12.030]  It's so fucking hot all of a sudden.
[49:12.870 --> 49:13.910]  It's so hot.
[49:14.070 --> 49:15.450]  I'm just dripping sweat.
[49:16.190 --> 49:16.870]  Oh, man.
[49:17.410 --> 49:18.150]  Who's driving?
[49:20.350 --> 49:22.430]  Whoever was just got whacked on my screen.
[49:22.870 --> 49:23.970]  No, Gavin's driving.
[49:23.970 --> 49:25.630]  He's doing it on my screen.
[49:25.710 --> 49:26.670]  He's killing it.
[49:26.670 --> 49:28.870]  He got whacked hard on that as well.
[49:30.510 --> 49:32.150]  That wasn't that great for me.
[49:32.350 --> 49:33.310]  No, no, that one was medium.
[49:33.590 --> 49:34.570]  That one was real medium.
[49:39.240 --> 49:40.000]  Was it actually medium?
[49:41.780 --> 49:42.600]  Don't get whacked.
[49:42.600 --> 49:43.960]  Oh, whacked so hard.
[49:46.640 --> 49:47.600]  Okay, so...
[49:47.600 --> 49:48.760]  He got whacked really hard
[49:48.760 --> 49:49.780]  on his screen, too.
[49:50.200 --> 49:51.000]  Oh, okay.
[49:52.320 --> 49:53.040]  My bad.
[49:53.600 --> 49:55.100]  Alright, Andrew, you're the leader.
[49:55.120 --> 49:56.520]  Hey, this is sunshine. Yeah, this is easy.
[49:56.620 --> 49:58.760]  We just gotta wait for it to come back, then we just sunshine it.
[49:59.360 --> 50:00.940]  Did you get this far when you did it, Andrew?
[50:01.100 --> 50:01.620]  Before your nap?
[50:01.720 --> 50:05.140]  I think I got to here and then fell right after.
[50:05.240 --> 50:06.580]  Oh, this is real easy, this part.
[50:07.380 --> 50:08.920]  We've never had an issue with this part.
[50:09.100 --> 50:11.760]  It does one more rotation than you think it's going to.
[50:11.760 --> 50:12.380]  Yeah, it does.
[50:13.000 --> 50:13.580]  Great call.
[50:13.580 --> 50:14.360]  You also don't have to jump.
[50:14.620 --> 50:17.500]  Because, boy, I really remember.
[50:18.880 --> 50:20.680]  You also do not have to jump to do it.
[50:20.680 --> 50:21.940]  You don't?
[50:22.220 --> 50:23.680]  You can walk. What? Or run.
[50:25.660 --> 50:26.560]  Alright, now do we go?
[50:26.680 --> 50:27.920]  Oh, it's going to do one more.
[50:27.980 --> 50:29.820]  Oh my god. We're fine.
[50:30.640 --> 50:31.860]  You're doing it. Great job.
[50:32.640 --> 50:34.700]  There you go, Gavin. That's good. Dude, you're staying in the middle.
[50:35.020 --> 50:36.760]  You're working towards it. Good job.
[50:37.440 --> 50:38.600]  Oh, Gavin!
[50:38.860 --> 50:39.800]  You're right there. You're good.
[50:40.280 --> 50:42.540]  Oh, look at you. You're riding it, dude.
[50:42.900 --> 50:44.040]  One more and then you guys go.
[50:44.380 --> 50:45.000]  Here you go.
[50:46.480 --> 50:48.680]  That's easy mode. Alright, Gavin, your biggest enemy.
[50:49.080 --> 50:51.040]  This is Gavin's one weakness.
[50:51.900 --> 50:53.160]  Remember, you don't have to do it.
[50:53.220 --> 50:54.420]  You can just jump up the side.
[50:54.920 --> 50:56.600]  Doesn't matter. Yeah, but you're doing it.
[50:57.340 --> 50:58.860]  Yeah, you're doing it.
[50:59.380 --> 51:00.800]  I wish I could...
[51:01.680 --> 51:02.820]  You're doing it less now.
[51:02.860 --> 51:05.160]  Sorry, I didn't realize why I couldn't jump for a second there.
[51:06.920 --> 51:08.940]  Okay, we're tying the platform in a knot again.
[51:09.940 --> 51:10.340]  I'm...
[51:10.340 --> 51:11.860]  My head is mushed underneath.
[51:14.300 --> 51:15.140]  You're doing great.
[51:15.960 --> 51:16.860]  You're doing great, buddy.
[51:16.860 --> 51:17.840]  Come over.
[51:18.800 --> 51:19.660]  You got it.
[51:20.420 --> 51:22.720]  Nice. You fool!
[51:24.680 --> 51:25.980]  I don't even know who I'm yelling at.
[51:26.240 --> 51:29.380]  Hey, Geoff, is this part easy part or this part hard part?
[51:31.320 --> 51:32.900]  We're on four different levels.
[51:33.200 --> 51:34.700]  We're on every level of this somehow.
[51:34.820 --> 51:36.260]  You're tying me in a knot.
[51:37.300 --> 51:38.300]  Get up here, Gavin.
[51:38.900 --> 51:39.760]  Geoffy, get up.
[51:41.100 --> 51:42.740]  First we need me and Geoffy.
[51:42.840 --> 51:43.920]  And then we need everyone.
[51:44.800 --> 51:46.620]  I'm going to shit my swim trunks.
[51:48.320 --> 51:49.120]  Alright, up we go.
[51:49.120 --> 51:50.320]  Wait for Geoff to come.
[51:51.680 --> 51:52.560]  Over there.
[51:52.940 --> 51:54.200]  Where are you guys?
[51:55.920 --> 51:58.200]  The two middle guys are in the...
[51:58.200 --> 52:00.440]  Alright, well, we can pull our ends up, can't we?
[52:00.980 --> 52:02.180]  Yes, there we go.
[52:02.540 --> 52:03.260]  Now everyone just...
[52:03.260 --> 52:04.620]  You silly bastards, get up there.
[52:06.260 --> 52:08.020]  I'm getting yanked.
[52:13.460 --> 52:13.900]  Freaking...
[52:13.900 --> 52:14.980]  We're good, we're good.
[52:17.580 --> 52:18.540]  Alright, okay.
[52:18.840 --> 52:20.280]  Guys, we have...
[52:22.700 --> 52:23.740]  Don't go that way.
[52:24.080 --> 52:25.980]  My face, my face.
[52:26.640 --> 52:26.800]  Yeah.
[52:27.360 --> 52:28.160]  Come on!
[52:32.140 --> 52:34.120]  Now this is just a go bit.
[52:34.280 --> 52:34.900]  So let's just go.
[52:35.160 --> 52:40.990]  Okay, everyone pull me up, please.
[52:41.730 --> 52:42.250]  Stop!
[52:44.370 --> 52:45.730]  Don't keep going!
[52:46.150 --> 52:46.950]  Oh no!
[52:47.510 --> 52:48.310]  It was a go bit.
[52:48.730 --> 52:51.710]  It was a go bit until...
[52:52.250 --> 52:53.550]  You want to just go get the car?
[52:54.030 --> 52:54.770]  Let's get the car.
[52:57.190 --> 52:58.390]  It was a go bit
[52:58.390 --> 52:59.870]  until Gavin went go down.
[53:00.590 --> 53:04.430]  If it was such a go bit,
[53:04.490 --> 53:05.550]  why didn't you go?
[53:07.510 --> 53:09.750]  I think what we've done is we've gone out of sync.
[53:09.750 --> 53:11.470]  Yeah, I just want to point out
[53:11.470 --> 53:13.590]  that the mods here said that the person
[53:13.590 --> 53:15.150]  who made you fall, Geoff.
[53:16.190 --> 53:16.550]  What?
[53:17.370 --> 53:19.090]  I'm just telling you what the mods are saying.
[53:19.210 --> 53:21.670]  I'm not agreeing or disagreeing, I'm just letting you know.
[53:21.690 --> 53:23.370]  If I made you fall, it was by going
[53:23.370 --> 53:25.590]  when I was told to go in the go bit.
[53:25.590 --> 53:26.870]  We all need to go at the same time.
[53:26.930 --> 53:29.130]  We were going on different platforms at the same time.
[53:29.130 --> 53:30.950]  You were going slowly.
[53:32.550 --> 53:32.870]  How you doing, Andrew?
[53:33.410 --> 53:34.870]  Why is it doing that? It's me driving.
[53:35.010 --> 53:35.630]  How you doing, Nick?
[53:36.750 --> 53:38.230]  Here it is right here.
[53:38.510 --> 53:39.450]  Fute Icon said
[53:39.450 --> 53:40.870]  definitely wasn't Geoff.
[53:41.230 --> 53:44.130]  UH Hockey Fan said it wasn't Geoff.
[53:44.650 --> 53:45.990]  I just take their names
[53:45.990 --> 53:46.970]  and I say whatever I want.
[53:46.990 --> 53:48.470]  No way!
[53:48.950 --> 53:49.350]  Nick!
[53:51.550 --> 53:53.330]  You better land!
[53:53.930 --> 53:55.790]  Land on this! Land on these!
[53:56.170 --> 53:56.710]  Oh no!
[53:58.990 --> 54:01.070]  What have I told you guys?
[54:01.070 --> 54:03.070]  We don't fail on a car bit.
[54:03.070 --> 54:05.310]  It was possible
[54:05.310 --> 54:06.550]  to fail on the car.
[54:07.210 --> 54:08.770]  You know what? First time for everything.
[54:10.750 --> 54:11.130]  This is
[54:11.690 --> 54:13.030]  unwatchable. This must be so
[54:13.030 --> 54:15.050]  annoying. It must be as annoying as it is to
[54:15.050 --> 54:16.950]  play. Andrew, have you been
[54:16.950 --> 54:18.430]  quiet for a minute? You have any thoughts?
[54:19.390 --> 54:21.050]  I said we don't
[54:21.050 --> 54:21.790]  fail on the car bit.
[54:23.390 --> 54:25.290]  You know what? But hey, new height.
[54:25.650 --> 54:26.350]  We hit a new goal.
[54:27.170 --> 54:28.430]  Things to be positive about.
[54:29.210 --> 54:30.990]  Things to be positive about. Look at that teamwork.
[54:31.950 --> 54:33.330]  From the team guy.
[54:33.590 --> 54:34.530]  Regulation team guy.
[54:34.730 --> 54:35.690]  What is happening?
[54:38.350 --> 54:39.170]  People are slow.
[54:39.390 --> 54:40.030]  Guys, hold on. Stop.
[54:40.510 --> 54:42.870]  People are forgetting how to play the easy parts.
[54:43.010 --> 54:43.870]  The baby parts.
[54:44.430 --> 54:44.750]  Go!
[54:52.330 --> 54:53.010]  Guys, thanks
[54:53.010 --> 54:54.990]  so much for watching live. This has been a really
[54:54.990 --> 54:57.090]  fantastic stream so far. Don't forget you can watch
[54:57.090 --> 54:59.010]  the VOD on Tuesday so you can replay and see
[54:59.010 --> 55:00.930]  who really made everyone fall. It's very
[55:00.930 --> 55:01.910]  important that you know.
[55:03.250 --> 55:04.250]  Sound off in the comments
[55:04.250 --> 55:06.290]  and let us know if any of those were wrong.
[55:06.510 --> 55:08.430]  Maybe they were all right.
[55:09.750 --> 55:10.930]  What do you think was the
[55:10.930 --> 55:13.250]  biggest blunder of the stream so far?
[55:14.350 --> 55:15.250]  The biggest blunder?
[55:15.510 --> 55:16.850]  Yeah, what do you think was the biggest one?
[55:17.070 --> 55:18.550]  The car. I mean, Nick drove the car.
[55:18.930 --> 55:20.690]  Are you ready? I'll call it again.
[55:21.550 --> 55:21.950]  Go!
[55:23.770 --> 55:24.170]  That...
[55:24.170 --> 55:26.830]  What I've learned with Geoff is you don't go by his
[55:26.830 --> 55:28.250]  words, you look at his character.
[55:28.250 --> 55:29.230]  Yeah, you have to.
[55:30.090 --> 55:31.710]  It's a body language situation.
[55:31.910 --> 55:34.350]  It was perfect and it worked. Every time I
[55:34.350 --> 55:36.170]  call it, we do it.
[55:36.810 --> 55:38.270]  Sorry, can we just
[55:38.270 --> 55:39.670]  pull Nick up for a sec? Thank you.
[55:40.870 --> 55:41.670]  Hey, you know what?
[55:41.970 --> 55:44.150]  You guys yanked me real good. Thanks. You saved me.
[55:44.710 --> 55:45.730]  Look at how well we're doing.
[55:46.470 --> 55:47.450]  You guys are crushing it.
[55:48.110 --> 55:49.390]  We're loving it. Don't forget about this.
[55:49.730 --> 55:51.930]  This is baby stuff. Remember,
[55:52.070 --> 55:53.590]  you don't have to go left or right.
[55:54.030 --> 55:55.710]  You can just hit the space bar.
[55:55.710 --> 55:57.110]  Yeah, yeah. Nick, do you want
[55:57.110 --> 55:59.130]  crackers right now? Who did that?
[55:59.370 --> 55:59.710]  Crackers?
[56:00.990 --> 56:02.130]  I do want a cracker.
[56:02.850 --> 56:04.130]  The boy left with them.
[56:04.250 --> 56:05.210]  The boy.
[56:05.410 --> 56:08.130]  The boy left with the crackers.
[56:08.910 --> 56:09.870]  The boy took the Ritz.
[56:14.890 --> 56:17.430]  Oh, the barrels of hay are nothing now.
[56:17.670 --> 56:17.750]  Wait.
[56:19.010 --> 56:20.610]  Always go the wrong way.
[56:20.810 --> 56:21.590]  Every time.
[56:21.590 --> 56:22.650]  Every goddamn time.
[56:22.990 --> 56:24.330]  Easy peasy.
[56:24.550 --> 56:26.950]  We're so close to beating the world record.
[56:27.030 --> 56:28.190]  We're already back at the car almost.
[56:28.510 --> 56:29.570]  Wait, wait.
[56:31.030 --> 56:32.730]  No one was helping you at all.
[56:33.670 --> 56:34.870]  You've got to help yourself.
[56:35.750 --> 56:36.990]  What are you feeling?
[56:38.490 --> 56:39.330]  What were you?
[56:40.470 --> 56:41.030]  Okay.
[56:41.510 --> 56:42.490]  Who was that?
[56:42.730 --> 56:44.550]  I don't know who that was.
[56:44.890 --> 56:47.230]  But boy, it put you at the very beginning.
[56:48.070 --> 56:49.430]  Corn cat, sound off.
[56:49.430 --> 56:50.870]  Who do you think that was?
[56:51.410 --> 56:53.190]  I need an instant replay.
[56:53.310 --> 56:54.790]  I don't know how I need one.
[56:55.830 --> 56:56.650]  Who did that?
[56:57.130 --> 56:58.190]  Can someone clip that?
[56:59.830 --> 57:01.110]  Can someone tell us?
[57:01.670 --> 57:03.110]  Clip it, and then Eric,
[57:03.330 --> 57:04.070]  you show it.
[57:05.710 --> 57:06.870]  I'll stream the clip.
[57:07.050 --> 57:09.770]  I don't know that anybody was to blame.
[57:10.530 --> 57:11.550]  I'll be happy to
[57:11.550 --> 57:13.350]  pause the game and do a
[57:13.350 --> 57:15.290]  frame by frame recap
[57:15.290 --> 57:17.070]  of what just happened. Analysis.
[57:17.070 --> 57:18.690]  I think it's
[57:18.690 --> 57:21.250]  going to be one of those things where it gets all bunched up.
[57:21.330 --> 57:23.170]  You can't tell. I think it was all bunched up.
[57:23.210 --> 57:23.790]  Okay, hang on.
[57:25.130 --> 57:26.690]  I got a clip.
[57:27.590 --> 57:28.550]  Give me a second.
[57:29.630 --> 57:31.150]  Lots of clips coming in.
[57:31.450 --> 57:33.210]  Hang on. Let me share my
[57:33.210 --> 57:34.890]  screen, so that way, Nick,
[57:36.270 --> 57:37.270]  you'll be able to
[57:37.270 --> 57:37.830]  see this.
[57:38.890 --> 57:40.430]  Give me a second here.
[57:40.670 --> 57:42.450]  Sharing my screen.
[57:42.950 --> 57:44.430]  I'm going to share my screen here.
[57:46.050 --> 57:46.450]  Instant
[57:46.450 --> 57:47.030]  replay.
[57:49.730 --> 57:50.670]  Are you guys
[57:50.670 --> 57:51.570]  able to see that?
[57:52.110 --> 57:54.610]  Not yet. I got to add a source.
[57:57.410 --> 57:58.010]  That's fine.
[57:58.270 --> 58:00.310]  It's on your call,
[58:00.530 --> 58:02.050]  Nick, so you let me know.
[58:02.910 --> 58:03.910]  Hold on, everybody.
[58:04.130 --> 58:06.490]  I'm going to show it to you in just a moment.
[58:06.750 --> 58:08.430]  Oh, guys, we even have speed.
[58:08.550 --> 58:09.590]  I'm going to play it at half speed.
[58:09.670 --> 58:12.410]  I can play it at full, or I can play it at half.
[58:12.830 --> 58:13.670]  I want it at
[58:13.670 --> 58:14.230]  half.
[58:15.750 --> 58:18.450]  It also has quarter speed, but I think that's going to be too slow
[58:18.450 --> 58:20.390]  to start, so let's see. Nick, you
[58:20.390 --> 58:21.130]  let me know when you're ready.
[58:22.550 --> 58:24.270]  Here we go. Half speed.
[58:25.830 --> 58:26.450]  You clearly
[58:26.450 --> 58:28.150]  see the front. Here we go.
[58:29.290 --> 58:30.310]  I'm going to pause here.
[58:30.970 --> 58:32.350]  The only one on the ground here is
[58:32.350 --> 58:32.630]  Geoff.
[58:34.930 --> 58:36.310]  It's before it gets
[58:36.310 --> 58:38.310]  to Geoff that it is
[58:38.310 --> 58:38.730]  launched.
[58:39.790 --> 58:40.790]  Let's slow it
[58:40.790 --> 58:41.330]  down further.
[58:41.830 --> 58:42.390]  Indication!
[58:44.570 --> 58:46.510]  We're slowing it down. Here we go.
[58:46.790 --> 58:47.550]  It's a pruder film.
[58:49.450 --> 58:50.790]  I don't think anybody
[58:50.790 --> 58:51.530]  touched it.
[58:53.310 --> 58:53.870]  Look.
[58:54.830 --> 58:56.610]  It's Andrew. Andrew's the lowest
[58:56.610 --> 58:58.510]  at this. Watch. It's definitely
[58:58.510 --> 59:00.930]  not Geoff. That's the important thing.
[59:01.890 --> 59:02.570]  I don't know that it's
[59:02.570 --> 59:03.870]  Andrew. Andrew is the lowest.
[59:04.330 --> 59:06.510]  But I don't know that it's his fault, though.
[59:08.090 --> 59:09.050]  Maybe it's
[59:09.050 --> 59:09.690]  netcode.
[59:10.190 --> 59:11.110]  I'm in the air.
[59:14.450 --> 59:15.070]  I'm at
[59:15.070 --> 59:16.190]  the peak of my height when
[59:16.190 --> 59:17.410]  it goes.
[59:18.110 --> 59:19.650]  I don't think it could be me.
[59:21.150 --> 59:22.290]  Look. See, I'm up.
[59:22.630 --> 59:24.450]  It wouldn't shoot across. I'm watching you and you're
[59:24.450 --> 59:26.330]  low. How could it have been me?
[59:26.410 --> 59:28.150]  I get pulled by it.
[59:28.170 --> 59:29.170]  But I'm jumped.
[59:33.000 --> 59:34.460]  Let's eliminate blame from people.
[59:35.080 --> 59:36.360]  Who's definitely out?
[59:36.360 --> 59:37.340]  Geoff is out.
[59:37.980 --> 59:40.020]  I think Geoff is out. Couldn't have been Geoff.
[59:40.120 --> 59:41.280]  I think it's yellow.
[59:41.940 --> 59:43.200]  I think it's yellow.
[59:44.320 --> 59:45.820]  You think it's Nick?
[59:46.380 --> 59:48.340]  Yellow seems to be at the very beginning.
[59:48.480 --> 59:50.320]  He seems to be in the lead of the four
[59:50.320 --> 59:51.520]  players. Like right there.
[59:52.100 --> 59:54.240]  If you pause it right at the beginning, he seems to be...
[59:54.240 --> 59:55.860]  It's weird because I definitely
[59:55.860 --> 59:57.860]  jumped, but it's like I didn't jump.
[59:57.960 --> 59:58.860]  It's like a half jump.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.140]  I think you can eliminate Gavin
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.240]  from blame also because he's way above
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.780]  in the front. He's so high.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.980]  I think it may have been me.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.200]  It's like I triggered the
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.100]  jump correctly, but it didn't jump right.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:13.600]  Wow.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:13.980]  Netcode.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.180]  Netcode issue. Alright, Nick, take it back
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.500]  to the game. Crazy.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.000]  Nobody's at fault.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.240]  For people wondering what my profile
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.300]  picture is on Discord, I think
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.320]  it's from an episode of Haunter.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:29.860]  Oh, is it really?
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.180]  I was dressed as a doctor. I don't remember why
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.020]  I was dressed like that. I think it was fun today.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:34.880]  Wow.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.260]  That was
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:39.880]  crazy. Crazy.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.000]  I love that we could go into
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.660]  this replay.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:44.660]  501!
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.060]  It's quitting time, baby.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.600]  We gotta
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.400]  go one more.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.500]  One more, right? Until we fall.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.180]  For the boys.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.360]  For the boys.
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.140]  On this elevator, can I
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.120]  say something to all of you right now?
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:04.720]  Christ.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.460]  I drove the car off the side
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.120]  on purpose because Nick thought he was
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.640]  driving. What?!
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.320]  I knew Nick wasn't
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.140]  driving! I'm like, that's not him!
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.600]  Wait a minute.
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.360]  Nick thought he was driving.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.460]  I thought it was just constantly moving.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.320]  I thought it was constantly
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.440]  moving! You let me believe
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440]  You didn't know
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.620]  you weren't driving?
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.560]  He was driving, so I drove off
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.660]  the side at the end just to get the reaction.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.420]  Andrew, you're not to blame
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.100]  for that. You're not to blame. I had to.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.740]  I didn't want to, but I had to.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.040]  Yeah, I had to.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.180]  That's horse shit. I'll kill you.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.420]  I had to.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.840]  I didn't want to. I had to.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.240]  No! He did
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.460]  leave him no choice.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.420]  No!
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.460]  What a move!
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.280]  He was doing
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.280]  exactly what I was controlling it to do!
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.340]  Nick was like, I'm driving, and then
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.420]  I hit the windmill thing, and I was trying to fix it
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.560]  and I heard him go, why is it going this
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:04.880]  way?
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.440]  I had to at that point.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.260]  I cannot wait to watch this on Tuesday.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.080]  I cannot wait.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.420]  That is the funniest
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.600]  fucking thing. Oh my god.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.640]  I can't believe
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.880]  I sat with that guilt.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:21.840]  That's why
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.900]  I was like, what's the biggest blunder in this stream?
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.460]  You guys, what do you think? I just wanted
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:26.660]  to get that in again.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.540]  Oh my god.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.480]  If you want, Nick, you can drive next time.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.700]  100%. It's all yours.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.140]  Yeah, if you guys make it up there, for sure.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.940]  I tried to go the other way for fun.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.860]  Just for fun.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.720]  I don't mind trying.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.180]  You just have to agree.
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.200]  What are you going to do?
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.260]  It's less jumps.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.120]  Yeah.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.200]  Gavin. Yep.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.300]  Why are you down there?
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.980]  Apparently we were just experimenting.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.300]  Gavin's getting into the mood.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.540]  Well, it's 5-0-1, he's done.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.560]  Yeah, it's 5-0-1.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:08.620]  Oh my god.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.180]  Oh, Gavin, you got so lucky.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.240]  What's going on?
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.840]  You're shagging each other.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.740]  What are you doing?
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.000]  This might just be the end of the stream.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.420]  Game crashed.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.700]  I think the game might have crashed, guys.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.000]  It did.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.140]  Wow, what an ending.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.320]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.120]  What a way to go out.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.120]  That's how we're going out?
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.380]  Yeah, what is he supposed to do?
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.300]  It crashed.
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.060]  Geoff said he lost power.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.400]  Are you serious?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:44.720]  Yeah.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.540]  No way.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.040]  Guys, thank you so much
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.100]  for watching.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.920]  This has been phenomenal.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.860]  This has been such a great stream.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.340]  We'll be back next Friday with something else.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.960]  I'm just kind of blown away
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.300]  by whatever all that was.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.200]  Does that mean we lost his audio?
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:10.880]  Oh no.
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:15.860]  Oh no.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.460]  Get a UPS, Matt.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.300]  You're a professional.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.160]  We got to hammer him for this one.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.520]  Corncats, rise up in the chat.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.780]  Thank you guys so much.
