[00:00.000 --> 00:01.580]  I hit the button. We are now live.
[00:01.780 --> 00:04.700]  I think the shirt in the store, I think, is so good right now.
[00:04.920 --> 00:07.140]  It's great. Did you buy the whole store yet?
[00:07.960 --> 00:10.740]  Oh, hey guys. Did you buy one of everything?
[00:11.180 --> 00:14.360]  I did. Yeah. I got a notification on my shift already too.
[00:15.020 --> 00:16.580]  What? Wait, did you buy one?
[00:17.080 --> 00:18.800]  Yeah, of course. I bought it yesterday.
[00:19.860 --> 00:22.980]  Or the day before yesterday. I bought one when we had the store up secretly.
[00:25.280 --> 00:26.780]  Oh, you could do that? I didn't know you could do that.
[00:26.780 --> 00:29.820]  Yeah, I told you guys. I had like the serial number one was my order.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.400]  Oh. I thought that was cool.
[00:32.180 --> 00:34.420]  That's what you meant. You were the first order.
[00:36.160 --> 00:38.960]  And welcome to another Last of Us part two.
[00:39.240 --> 00:41.220]  We're playing on Grounded Difficulty through the month of October,
[00:41.360 --> 00:42.420]  trying to get through this game.
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.600]  I'm Nick and I'm joined by Eric, Geoff and Gavin today.
[00:47.200 --> 00:50.160]  Yo, guys, what's up? I've been here for every single one of these.
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.940]  That's my thing. Not true. Hell yeah. What?
[00:53.620 --> 00:55.500]  What? Huh? What?
[00:55.620 --> 00:58.140]  That's my thing. Oh, I got confused.
[00:58.140 --> 01:00.780]  I thought I got confused about who I was.
[01:00.960 --> 01:03.840]  I got Nick's back. I always show up for Nick.
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.900]  That's awesome. That's pretty cool.
[01:06.100 --> 01:07.860]  Have I missed one of these yet? I don't think so.
[01:08.080 --> 01:10.880]  Until he has like an Alex Jones style meltdown.
[01:11.000 --> 01:11.720]  And then I got to separate.
[01:11.940 --> 01:13.500]  Dude, have you heard that they're selling?
[01:13.620 --> 01:16.160]  They're selling all the Infowars stuff. I saw that, yeah.
[01:16.280 --> 01:18.320]  We can buy it. We talked about it for 100% me.
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.800]  Yeah, we talked about buying.
[01:19.860 --> 01:22.380]  We want to buy the table, but you have to buy all the media rights
[01:22.380 --> 01:24.060]  if you want to buy any of the set and everything.
[01:24.840 --> 01:28.060]  Yeah, I think I would give Nick two months of going full
[01:28.060 --> 01:29.580]  Infowars before I gave up on him.
[01:30.100 --> 01:32.000]  Wow, two months? That's actually really nice.
[01:32.200 --> 01:32.700]  That is nice.
[01:32.820 --> 01:34.860]  Well, that's because I couldn't stick with it that long.
[01:34.980 --> 01:35.540]  It's too much.
[01:37.140 --> 01:38.660]  Also, I can't turn that red.
[01:38.940 --> 01:39.620]  Let's be honest.
[01:39.800 --> 01:42.720]  Oh, I think we could we could find some supplements that turn you red red.
[01:43.520 --> 01:44.960]  It's barely carrot juice, right?
[01:45.080 --> 01:46.220]  Carrot juice. Yeah, it's carrot juice.
[01:47.580 --> 01:49.620]  That's a callback to something that the audience won't hear.
[01:49.820 --> 01:52.500]  Yeah, it's a callback to something that's later in the week.
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.340]  By the time, if you're watching the VOD of this, you just laughed.
[01:56.400 --> 01:57.480]  If you're watching this live,
[01:57.480 --> 01:58.620]  you don't know what's happening.
[01:59.060 --> 02:01.900]  Oh, yeah. That's the dangers of recording batch recording.
[02:02.660 --> 02:03.880]  Oh, oh, yeah, it is.
[02:04.100 --> 02:06.140]  Dude, that's a seven.
[02:06.980 --> 02:09.680]  Son Bound says I was associated with peeing on Edgar Wright.
[02:09.760 --> 02:10.180]  That wasn't me.
[02:10.240 --> 02:12.760]  It was, you know, and then now Peter's pants
[02:13.780 --> 02:14.620]  qualifies piss boy.
[02:14.960 --> 02:16.140]  You think peeing my pants
[02:17.160 --> 02:19.040]  was as bad as it got this week? Wait till you hear the.
[02:19.220 --> 02:20.840]  Oh, my God. No spoilers.
[02:20.920 --> 02:21.940]  But holy shit.
[02:22.340 --> 02:26.080]  The episode that we recorded that comes out next week is just so on fire.
[02:26.080 --> 02:27.000]  It's nuts.
[02:27.360 --> 02:31.780]  Gavin just out of the gate, just hitting home runs.
[02:31.960 --> 02:33.040]  I had to get off my chest.
[02:33.520 --> 02:35.840]  It's like Gavin was like, we're off more than just your chest.
[02:36.300 --> 02:39.280]  Gavin was like Shohei Otani with men on base.
[02:39.480 --> 02:40.400]  It was fucking crazy.
[02:40.860 --> 02:43.000]  Oh, man. Oh, wow.
[02:44.000 --> 02:44.840]  Yeah, pretty good.
[02:44.840 --> 02:46.980]  I like that I didn't piss on Edgar Wright.
[02:47.060 --> 02:48.820]  I'm just now associated with pissing on him.
[02:48.880 --> 02:51.040]  I never I wasn't anywhere near the guy.
[02:51.940 --> 02:54.260]  Well, wow. By association, you were.
[02:54.960 --> 02:55.600]  Yeah, tough.
[02:57.560 --> 02:59.320]  Genetically, you were on that flight, though, weren't you, though?
[03:01.000 --> 03:01.640]  Genetically, genetically.
[03:02.860 --> 03:04.200]  Good job. Good job.
[03:04.380 --> 03:07.260]  I think you're careful with this level or blinds.
[03:07.300 --> 03:08.200]  You can cut yourself.
[03:08.820 --> 03:10.260]  Oh, dude, they are sharp.
[03:10.360 --> 03:11.700]  You don't want to get a paper cut out here.
[03:11.760 --> 03:12.400]  It could get infected.
[03:12.540 --> 03:14.560]  And I bet antibiotics are hard to find.
[03:14.960 --> 03:15.660]  Yeah, I'll bet.
[03:15.920 --> 03:17.300]  Oh, can I hop? Yeah.
[03:18.040 --> 03:21.520]  Like if I wanted to make antibiotics, it's just like a bunch of like plants
[03:21.520 --> 03:23.240]  and stuff. You got to go find a bunch.
[03:23.240 --> 03:25.660]  You got to go find a bunch of biotics.
[03:26.100 --> 03:28.620]  Yeah. Oh, and then you find out what's against them.
[03:28.780 --> 03:32.140]  Then you have to turn them against their religion.
[03:32.480 --> 03:35.300]  Oh, wow. Yeah, it's a whole thing, dude.
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.460]  We're not going to Google how to make antibiotics and just see if it.
[03:40.820 --> 03:45.800]  I'm thinking that I'm going to become sort of like so far left
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.140]  with like the vegan eating clean stuff that I'm like, I Russell Brandit
[03:49.140 --> 03:51.760]  and I go all the way around to like the right crazy style.
[03:51.760 --> 03:53.140]  Oh, yeah.
[03:53.140 --> 03:55.980]  You start baptizing people in your tiny whitey's.
[03:56.100 --> 03:59.940]  Yeah, but I'm selling a medallion that gives me powers or whatever.
[04:00.180 --> 04:03.120]  How to make antibiotics?
[04:05.120 --> 04:05.980]  Yeah. Yeah.
[04:05.980 --> 04:06.920]  Why is everybody getting?
[04:07.320 --> 04:09.920]  Why is everybody so invested in making meth at home
[04:09.920 --> 04:11.820]  when you could probably also make antibiotics?
[04:12.380 --> 04:14.580]  Yeah. Just don't use Pyrex.
[04:15.460 --> 04:16.560]  Yeah, you got it.
[04:16.640 --> 04:19.180]  You got to use an uppercase P Pyrex.
[04:19.240 --> 04:21.000]  Don't use lowercase P Pyrex.
[04:21.400 --> 04:23.640]  Christ, I'm trying to remember where we talked about that last.
[04:25.840 --> 04:28.020]  And Nick, I couldn't tell you, but it was in the last week.
[04:29.200 --> 04:30.460]  I had no fucking clue.
[04:31.020 --> 04:32.480]  I had no idea, man.
[04:32.480 --> 04:33.320]  It's somewhere in there.
[04:33.400 --> 04:34.160]  Oh, I remember what it was.
[04:34.300 --> 04:36.260]  We was doing a throat girt.
[04:36.580 --> 04:38.520]  Yep. We were. Oh, yeah.
[04:39.300 --> 04:40.620]  Oh, we were girping, baby.
[04:40.960 --> 04:42.420]  I forgot we throat girted.
[04:42.540 --> 04:42.880]  Wow.
[04:43.820 --> 04:44.800]  Now do we have to make
[04:45.400 --> 04:47.420]  do we have to make that throat lure or whatever?
[04:47.840 --> 04:48.480]  I don't know.
[04:48.480 --> 04:51.160]  I think it should be a limited edition run of throatless.
[04:51.260 --> 04:54.780]  And then you would like a space to mark your own throttle.
[04:59.640 --> 05:01.400]  There's just a small window.
[05:01.760 --> 05:05.620]  It's just like a small lower line and like a small upper line.
[05:05.700 --> 05:06.920]  It's like you're probably in here somewhere.
[05:08.640 --> 05:09.820]  Just a throat range.
[05:10.040 --> 05:13.460]  Yeah, this is the throat range.
[05:16.340 --> 05:17.220]  Oh, Christ.
[05:17.220 --> 05:18.280]  All right, let's get that.
[05:18.680 --> 05:19.360]  You better get all these.
[05:19.700 --> 05:21.240]  I don't want to learn about any of these people.
[05:21.840 --> 05:24.960]  Oh, that was well, you know, it's a car to one of the people who was there
[05:24.960 --> 05:25.660]  when Joel died.
[05:25.820 --> 05:26.580]  You don't have to explain it to me.
[05:26.720 --> 05:26.940]  All right.
[05:27.200 --> 05:28.940]  Honey is an antibiotic, I guess.
[05:30.020 --> 05:31.460]  Garlic, garlic extracts.
[05:31.500 --> 05:36.580]  I've been I don't know how to extract garlic, but myrrh.
[05:36.640 --> 05:38.080]  You guys got any myrrh or frankincense?
[05:38.480 --> 05:39.600]  Frankincense, that's good shit.
[05:40.960 --> 05:44.440]  I when I first moved here, a bunch of people told me to buy local honey
[05:44.440 --> 05:46.440]  because it'll help reduce your allergies.
[05:47.360 --> 05:48.080]  Yeah. Yeah.
[05:48.360 --> 05:50.660]  I only eat local honey, and that's not really by choice.
[05:50.740 --> 05:53.140]  It's just sort of like the thing that I happen to get.
[05:53.300 --> 05:55.780]  That's a that's a that's a good life lesson in general.
[05:55.940 --> 05:58.400]  Always eat. Get your honey locally, no matter where you live.
[05:58.700 --> 06:00.100]  Yeah. How often are people using honey?
[06:00.480 --> 06:01.960]  I use honey almost every day.
[06:02.440 --> 06:05.080]  I think people who drink a lot of tea probably use honey a lot.
[06:05.160 --> 06:08.640]  People that want a sugar substitute, like a healthier sugar substitute.
[06:08.840 --> 06:14.200]  I do. I do a little bit of Greek yogurt and honey on the top.
[06:14.440 --> 06:15.640]  Oh, that's interesting.
[06:16.000 --> 06:17.580]  Yeah. Never touch that.
[06:17.840 --> 06:20.000]  But that's that's not your speed.
[06:20.080 --> 06:22.680]  I understand that. I became a Greek yogurt guy recently.
[06:22.820 --> 06:23.900]  I really like it. It's nice.
[06:23.980 --> 06:24.380]  Oh, really?
[06:24.620 --> 06:25.780]  Some berries and some walnuts.
[06:26.700 --> 06:27.880]  That's made in Greece. Yeah.
[06:28.220 --> 06:31.200]  I always put it in smoothies if I make a smoothie.
[06:31.740 --> 06:32.720]  Yeah, I do, too.
[06:32.780 --> 06:35.460]  But I favor peanut butter, I think, in my smoothie.
[06:35.920 --> 06:37.480]  Peanut butter is good for my protein.
[06:37.500 --> 06:39.140]  Peanut butter is just it's so good.
[06:39.180 --> 06:42.880]  Like if you can whip a bunch of peanut butter in with Greek yogurt, boy, it's really good.
[06:42.880 --> 06:43.980]  Oh, now that's...
[06:43.980 --> 06:47.840]  Millie was on a peanut butter and blueberry kick for a while.
[06:48.100 --> 06:49.440]  Smoothie, I would make them for her. She loved it.
[06:49.620 --> 06:50.620]  Yeah, it's a good combination.
[06:50.920 --> 06:51.240]  Yeah.
[06:52.000 --> 06:52.560]  Aw, damn.
[06:52.980 --> 06:54.400]  Sorry, I'm collecting shit.
[06:54.420 --> 06:55.300]  Gavin, do you say yogurt?
[06:56.360 --> 06:56.800]  Yeah.
[06:57.740 --> 06:58.380]  Is it yogurt?
[06:58.660 --> 06:59.240]  Or a little yogi?
[07:00.720 --> 07:01.160]  Whenever...
[07:01.160 --> 07:02.000]  Yogi.
[07:02.420 --> 07:02.860]  Yogi.
[07:04.020 --> 07:08.080]  Whenever you're playing a video game and you go upstairs or you go downstairs
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.600]  and there's an invisible wall that's shown as a barricaded wall.
[07:13.140 --> 07:13.460]  Yeah.
[07:13.660 --> 07:15.180]  And the game clearly won't let you go any further.
[07:15.480 --> 07:20.080]  Do you just assume that there are survivors on the other side of that and you just don't get to know what their story is?
[07:20.180 --> 07:20.940]  Because I always do.
[07:21.280 --> 07:22.300]  I would think so.
[07:22.380 --> 07:26.420]  I never considered that and that's cool.
[07:26.640 --> 07:28.240]  That's a great way to look at that.
[07:28.840 --> 07:30.300]  Eric's about to replay a bunch of shit.
[07:30.480 --> 07:31.480]  Yeah, that's cool.
[07:31.660 --> 07:33.100]  I never thought about what's on the other side of that door.
[07:33.420 --> 07:36.640]  If it wasn't for this fucking chair, I could have fallen in love today.
[07:36.700 --> 07:37.300]  Who knows, you know?
[07:37.880 --> 07:38.200]  Oh.
[07:38.720 --> 07:40.740]  Some really romantic writings are up in that room.
[07:40.740 --> 07:43.400]  And I'll just never get to read them in this lifetime.
[07:44.540 --> 07:44.640]  Huh.
[07:45.080 --> 07:45.440]  Sad.
[07:45.700 --> 07:47.180]  Anyway, I'm scavenging.
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.320]  Sorry, I'm just looking around.
[07:48.360 --> 07:49.120]  God, why scavenge?
[07:49.240 --> 07:50.640]  You need all this stuff.
[07:50.820 --> 07:51.880]  I need all the shit.
[07:51.960 --> 07:52.400]  I'm just picking...
[07:52.400 --> 07:53.520]  Oh, you're dead.
[07:53.840 --> 07:55.020]  That was a long blood streak.
[07:55.840 --> 07:56.240]  What's that?
[07:56.940 --> 07:58.400]  It's because there's a bad guy in here.
[07:58.700 --> 07:58.900]  Ah!
[07:59.180 --> 07:59.920]  Oh, God.
[08:00.420 --> 08:04.600]  I mean, you didn't consider that there might be a guy up here?
[08:04.980 --> 08:05.920]  Well, I thought about it.
[08:06.360 --> 08:07.240]  Oh, OK, good.
[08:07.380 --> 08:09.480]  I wasn't sure if you thought about it.
[08:09.580 --> 08:10.620]  You made a new blood streak.
[08:10.620 --> 08:13.440]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[08:14.480 --> 08:15.420]  Warning more people.
[08:16.160 --> 08:18.260]  I'm a little hurt in this moment.
[08:19.120 --> 08:19.560]  Emotionally?
[08:20.560 --> 08:21.640]  Ah, yeah, sure.
[08:24.440 --> 08:25.000]  All right.
[08:25.200 --> 08:25.460]  Oh, look.
[08:25.460 --> 08:28.960]  You've had some time to think about some things and you've decided.
[08:29.660 --> 08:30.960]  Geoff, what do you think happened in there?
[08:31.820 --> 08:35.920]  We'll never get to find out, but for all we know, there's like a whole fucking family
[08:35.920 --> 08:37.220]  on the other side of that ironing board.
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.380]  They're like, just stay quiet.
[08:38.500 --> 08:39.520]  Just fucking stay quiet.
[08:40.180 --> 08:42.460]  She got rid of it, she got rid of it, just wait until she goes.
[08:42.640 --> 08:45.020]  It doesn't sound like zombies, Mark. It sounds like people.
[08:45.260 --> 08:47.680]  People are more dangerous than zombies, you know this, Carol.
[08:48.180 --> 08:48.860]  Oh wow, that's pretty good.
[08:49.280 --> 08:50.120]  Yeah, you know, that kind of thing.
[08:50.720 --> 08:52.400]  Wow, one bullet, I can use it on myself.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.820]  Oh no, the fog has lifted. Oh no.
[08:58.480 --> 08:59.860]  Oh, keep forgetting.
[09:00.800 --> 09:06.340]  We've played so many games recently that I have forgotten all reload mechanics.
[09:06.860 --> 09:07.280]  It's hard.
[09:07.280 --> 09:08.020]  In every single one of them.
[09:08.020 --> 09:12.260]  Like, this is the thing that I've learned since we started doing this.
[09:12.840 --> 09:20.380]  It is hard to keep the button straight on games that are similar but different.
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.440]  And I've never in my life really had this problem because I don't jump around to like 10 different games.
[09:28.620 --> 09:29.840]  It's this career.
[09:30.180 --> 09:33.740]  Yeah, you're describing how I blew myself up in Rainbow Six Vegas.
[09:33.740 --> 09:37.700]  When I went to go behind cover and I hit grenade.
[09:37.980 --> 09:43.960]  Yeah, it's really like, it gave me like a different sort of perspective on it.
[09:44.380 --> 09:47.980]  Because I've never been a wrong buttons guy, like almost ever.
[09:48.620 --> 09:51.260]  And nothing worse than switching to Nintendo and back too.
[09:51.400 --> 09:53.360]  Because then you've got your B's and your A's are switched.
[09:53.760 --> 09:54.660]  Yeah, that's tough.
[09:54.740 --> 09:56.720]  I've backed out of Mario Kart so many times.
[09:57.320 --> 10:03.000]  It's somehow especially worse when you're returning to games you play semi-regularly to.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  Because it feels like it should be familiar and you can't give yourself any grace for not knowing shit.
[10:08.060 --> 10:08.580]  It's Grand Theft Auto.
[10:08.880 --> 10:09.560]  Yeah, it's Grand Theft Auto.
[10:09.940 --> 10:13.500]  Going back to GTA is like, why did I hit that button?
[10:13.580 --> 10:14.380]  It's not reload.
[10:14.660 --> 10:17.960]  And you're like, oh, the three other games, one of them, this was reload.
[10:18.160 --> 10:20.200]  And then one of them was Ultimate Chicken Horse.
[10:21.800 --> 10:25.600]  You're like, oh, why is jump in Bethesda games? God damn it.
[10:25.940 --> 10:26.940]  Oh, yep, yep.
[10:27.400 --> 10:30.840]  Yeah, the killer is the B reload in GTA.
[10:30.840 --> 10:33.580]  The A reload in GRAW 2.
[10:34.260 --> 10:35.920]  Then there's X.
[10:36.080 --> 10:40.320]  And apparently, so I picked up, I was telling you guys earlier, the Master Chief Collection.
[10:40.480 --> 10:40.620]  Yeah.
[10:40.720 --> 10:41.840]  And I was playing ODST.
[10:42.500 --> 10:47.960]  And the default settings are reload is right bumper.
[10:49.120 --> 10:49.680]  Wrong.
[10:50.320 --> 10:50.880]  Wrong.
[10:51.260 --> 10:53.000]  That's crazy.
[10:54.380 --> 10:55.500]  That's... what?
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.900]  Alright, I'm gonna throw this grenade.
[10:58.100 --> 10:58.940]  Oh, I'm changing my clip.
[10:59.220 --> 10:59.480]  What?
[11:00.840 --> 11:04.240]  It's really bad when a game will have a certain set of controls.
[11:04.400 --> 11:08.460]  And then the sequel has a different set like flips, jump and shoot all the time.
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.200]  But when a game comes out and it's exactly the same, except the controls are switched.
[11:13.460 --> 11:15.280]  It's a real shit show.
[11:16.060 --> 11:21.720]  Worms is a great example because I feel like we look so goddamn dumb every time we play worms.
[11:21.960 --> 11:24.860]  But part of it is because we're so goddamn dumb.
[11:24.940 --> 11:28.060]  I was going to say, I will say I'll give us grace for some other games.
[11:28.060 --> 11:30.040]  I think worms is a whole different...
[11:30.040 --> 11:30.880]  It's so hard.
[11:32.040 --> 11:35.200]  I was still learning how to play the last one and it showed.
[11:35.320 --> 11:37.200]  Sometimes X is shoot, sometimes it's jump.
[11:38.020 --> 11:39.680]  I never know which worms it is.
[11:40.280 --> 11:42.240]  I drowned a lot in that game.
[11:44.680 --> 11:45.940]  Oh, I remember this part.
[11:47.120 --> 11:47.340]  Yeah.
[11:47.760 --> 11:48.860]  Just check out shit, man.
[11:48.920 --> 11:51.400]  Yeah, you just get a look at like...
[11:51.400 --> 11:51.680]  What's this?
[11:52.860 --> 11:53.760]  Oh, bomb.
[11:54.260 --> 11:57.020]  Oh, take that.
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.880]  You get a cool little look of like, oh, here's what it was to live here.
[12:02.880 --> 12:05.120]  Little Nick Ted Kaczynski action.
[12:09.160 --> 12:12.540]  You got a score to settle with the university or anything right now, Nick?
[12:13.220 --> 12:16.140]  Shouts out Nick Nation, we know you're supporting this guy.
[12:16.420 --> 12:17.720]  He's got a lot of big ideas.
[12:19.860 --> 12:23.740]  There's a good chance he might be getting a hold of a certain set you might be familiar with.
[12:24.380 --> 12:25.960]  Start doing some productions from it.
[12:25.960 --> 12:29.140]  This took an unfortunate turn.
[12:35.340 --> 12:37.700]  These Thursday afternoons are always so fun.
[12:40.200 --> 12:42.140]  I don't know if this is true or not.
[12:42.420 --> 12:45.500]  I am very curious.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.120]  Also, I don't care. I'm not looking to get political here. I don't give a fuck.
[12:52.020 --> 12:55.200]  Trump canceled a bunch of interviews, but I just saw a tweet.
[12:55.200 --> 12:58.940]  Trump is expected to do an interview this week on the Undertaker's podcast.
[13:03.820 --> 13:05.020]  That is...
[13:06.060 --> 13:07.260]  Something happened.
[13:07.520 --> 13:11.520]  When people talk about timelines diverting and we're in the bad spot, whatever.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.080]  This is maybe that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
[13:15.260 --> 13:16.780]  Maybe that's so not.
[13:17.200 --> 13:22.400]  Donald Trump is running for president and he's going to go on the Undertaker's podcast.
[13:25.140 --> 13:29.640]  I don't know that you're going to know the answer to this, Eric, but I figured you have the best shot of all of us.
[13:30.060 --> 13:35.300]  The Undertaker's podcast, on it, is he the character of the Undertaker?
[13:35.660 --> 13:38.460]  No, he's himself. He's Mark.
[13:39.520 --> 13:42.760]  People call him Taker and take and all that stuff because that's just...
[13:42.760 --> 13:44.840]  He's been the Undertaker for so long.
[13:45.300 --> 13:46.580]  That's what people call him and everything.
[13:46.800 --> 13:47.520]  They don't call him Undy?
[13:48.060 --> 13:49.480]  They don't call him Undy.
[13:50.320 --> 13:50.720]  Sad.
[13:51.200 --> 13:56.240]  Yeah, they call him Taker or whatever, but it's him just sort of like telling old stories.
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.720]  Having like, hey, here's the Godfather from like 1998 WWF.
[14:01.580 --> 14:02.800]  You know what I mean? Like that kind of thing.
[14:03.940 --> 14:06.720]  It's just like telling old stories and stuff, but him...
[14:08.360 --> 14:09.820]  What are you doing?
[14:10.160 --> 14:11.160]  I didn't know they were there.
[14:11.180 --> 14:11.880]  Donald Trump is hilarious.
[14:12.640 --> 14:13.960]  That's a human living man.
[14:14.560 --> 14:15.020]  Not anymore.
[14:15.760 --> 14:16.860]  Give him a kick.
[14:17.340 --> 14:18.640]  I want to do... Oh, hello.
[14:19.120 --> 14:20.460]  You could have kicked him, but you didn't.
[14:21.220 --> 14:22.460]  Yeah, but you know...
[14:23.380 --> 14:24.120]  Yeah, it's pretty brutal.
[14:25.100 --> 14:26.360]  There you go. Take a look at that.
[14:26.380 --> 14:27.700]  Oh, boy.
[14:28.120 --> 14:29.120]  Oh, I love his mouth.
[14:29.460 --> 14:29.980]  Oh, shit.
[14:30.900 --> 14:31.300]  Oh, dear.
[14:31.460 --> 14:31.940]  Well, he's dead.
[14:34.660 --> 14:35.440]  Death from above.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.340]  What are you looking up for, you idiot?
[14:40.600 --> 14:41.320]  Yeah, what the hell?
[14:41.400 --> 14:42.960]  Yeah, you have a scout up here.
[14:43.020 --> 14:43.500]  What are you, stupid?
[14:44.100 --> 14:44.560]  Oh, my God.
[14:44.880 --> 14:46.100]  Dina scared the shit out of me.
[14:48.380 --> 14:51.520]  Did I ever tell you I have an Undertaker story, Eric?
[14:52.080 --> 14:52.360]  Really?
[14:53.160 --> 14:56.240]  Yeah, I'm not gonna... This was so, so long ago.
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.400]  And I probably told it much better on the RT podcast or probably Drunk Tank many, many years ago.
[15:01.460 --> 15:01.840]  It was that old.
[15:02.140 --> 15:04.160]  But Gus and I were at Comic-Con one year.
[15:04.620 --> 15:06.300]  Might have been around the time we met y'all.
[15:08.020 --> 15:13.260]  And a guy came up to our booth and was just one of those guys that wouldn't leave, you know?
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.380]  Where you get a guy where you're like, oh, he's gonna be here for like an hour now.
[15:15.380 --> 15:16.520]  Oh, I know.
[15:17.080 --> 15:20.480]  Super polite and friendly and nice, but kind of awkward as well.
[15:21.060 --> 15:25.220]  And, you know, you're just trying to come up with small talk because he's not going anywhere.
[15:25.860 --> 15:29.300]  And at some point he goes, uh, my brother's the Undertaker.
[15:30.480 --> 15:31.540]  And Gus goes, excuse me?
[15:31.620 --> 15:34.760]  And he goes, my brother, the wrestler, the Undertaker, you know, the Undertaker?
[15:35.420 --> 15:37.060]  And Gus and I go, yeah, yeah.
[15:37.280 --> 15:38.340]  He goes, that's my brother.
[15:39.940 --> 15:41.660]  Your brother's the Undertaker?
[15:41.980 --> 15:43.620]  He goes, yeah, he's really cool.
[15:44.140 --> 15:44.600]  Sorry, Nick.
[15:45.760 --> 15:47.040]  He's really cool.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.560]  Yeah, or something says shit like that.
[15:48.720 --> 15:50.560]  And Gus goes, I don't believe you.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.520]  And the guy's like, no, he is.
[15:53.760 --> 15:55.500]  And I'm like, what's his name?
[15:55.560 --> 15:57.180]  And he's like, the Undertaker.
[15:57.500 --> 15:58.980]  And I'm like, yeah, but what's his name?
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.440]  And he's like, his name's the Undertaker.
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.880]  And he goes, oh, here, hold on.
[16:01.920 --> 16:02.440]  I have a photo.
[16:02.620 --> 16:03.340]  I can prove it.
[16:03.460 --> 16:04.420]  And we're like, oh, OK, cool.
[16:04.560 --> 16:05.780]  And he pulls out his wallet.
[16:05.940 --> 16:10.000]  And out of his wallet, he takes out, I shit you not, an Undertaker baseball card.
[16:10.960 --> 16:11.820]  And we went, oh.
[16:12.820 --> 16:15.140]  He's clearly your brother.
[16:15.500 --> 16:17.440]  And then he eventually wandered off.
[16:17.700 --> 16:19.660]  But then we realized very quickly, Nicky died again.
[16:20.140 --> 16:25.000]  Realized very quickly that, yeah, that he, I think he really did believe it, you know?
[16:25.140 --> 16:27.340]  And, you know, what's the point of arguing with that?
[16:27.580 --> 16:28.640]  He's a nice enough fella.
[16:29.040 --> 16:32.500]  What were your methods to get people to shuffle off?
[16:35.580 --> 16:37.080]  Do you remember any?
[16:37.320 --> 16:38.660]  Like, is there any that come to mind?
[16:38.680 --> 16:40.980]  It's been, honestly, it's been so long.
[16:41.860 --> 16:43.620]  It's hard to reconnect with it.
[16:43.700 --> 16:44.720]  I know we had them.
[16:45.060 --> 16:47.200]  I know Gus was a fucking pro at it.
[16:47.920 --> 16:50.120]  But I can't sit down and remember exactly.
[16:50.540 --> 16:52.260]  Maybe if you say something, it'll jog my memory.
[16:53.100 --> 16:57.760]  The big one was I would shake their hand and then go, oh, that's great.
[16:58.280 --> 17:00.400]  So what else are you excited to do at the convention?
[17:03.460 --> 17:06.480]  Then they would talk about a couple other things or whatever.
[17:06.560 --> 17:08.040]  I'm like, oh, man, you should definitely check that out.
[17:08.100 --> 17:08.840]  Let us know how it is.
[17:08.900 --> 17:10.260]  Well, have a good one.
[17:10.260 --> 17:13.680]  And then that was sort of it seemed to work most of the time.
[17:13.860 --> 17:14.200]  Yeah.
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.580]  You know, you still got the occasional like person who did not leave.
[17:19.740 --> 17:23.000]  But mostly, you know, mostly it was pretty good.
[17:24.080 --> 17:24.980]  By and large.
[17:26.360 --> 17:27.720]  Do you remember those days, Gavin?
[17:27.960 --> 17:29.320]  Anything jump to mind?
[17:30.500 --> 17:32.240]  I wasn't really ever brave to do that.
[17:32.680 --> 17:33.200]  Well, brave enough.
[17:33.600 --> 17:35.660]  Gavin, that was his first gig at the company, really.
[17:36.400 --> 17:36.660]  What?
[17:37.180 --> 17:39.680]  Going around to conventions and setting up the booths and stuff for us.
[17:39.680 --> 17:42.680]  He did that for a year or two.
[17:42.800 --> 17:44.420]  He'd go, he'd be there the day before us.
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.340]  And he'd, you know, depalatize and everything and set up and we'd roll in.
[17:48.500 --> 17:50.820]  It was really good when...
[17:50.820 --> 17:52.180]  Shoot him again, Nina. Shoot him again.
[17:53.040 --> 17:55.540]  I'd be like, where's the... when you pick up dealer badges and all that.
[17:55.680 --> 17:57.160]  And they'd be like, oh, talk to this guy.
[17:57.420 --> 17:59.480]  And then you'd go there and then they'd be like, oh, go talk to that guy.
[18:00.100 --> 18:05.520]  And the amount of times I just started ignoring everyone and just climbing in the unloading bay without any ID or anything.
[18:05.800 --> 18:06.120]  Yeah.
[18:06.260 --> 18:07.440]  To set up the booth. Unbelievable.
[18:07.780 --> 18:08.180]  Over there.
[18:08.480 --> 18:10.060]  You just walk into the back of those things.
[18:10.160 --> 18:11.180]  No one gives a shit.
[18:11.880 --> 18:12.140]  Right.
[18:15.220 --> 18:16.060]  You're right about that.
[18:16.140 --> 18:19.240]  And there was always some dumb thing too where it'd be like, I need to get a badge.
[18:19.340 --> 18:20.980]  And they're like, you can't go inside without a badge.
[18:21.020 --> 18:22.540]  And I go, oh, okay, where do I pick up my badge?
[18:22.560 --> 18:23.540]  And they go, oh, it's inside.
[18:23.740 --> 18:24.080]  It's inside.
[18:24.120 --> 18:25.620]  And you go, but how do I get it?
[18:25.620 --> 18:26.840]  And they go, well, you gotta go in and get it.
[18:26.880 --> 18:27.720]  And I go, well, can you let me in?
[18:27.740 --> 18:28.900]  And they go, no, you can't go in without a badge.
[18:29.140 --> 18:29.300]  Yeah.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.660]  So I have to break in now?
[18:30.760 --> 18:31.300]  Okay, cool.
[18:32.660 --> 18:34.080]  Dina, please kill the other dude.
[18:34.360 --> 18:34.620]  Please.
[18:34.620 --> 18:38.200]  Yeah, I'm sure I technically trespassed in a bunch of convention centers.
[18:38.840 --> 18:39.280]  Yeah.
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.860]  But then I got the badge, so I was credentialed up from the inside.
[18:44.140 --> 18:50.480]  It was definitely a thing, like doing conventions was you just kind of don't listen to people
[18:50.480 --> 18:53.020]  until you've gotten the result that you need.
[18:53.200 --> 18:56.780]  And then it's like, okay, I'm, you know, I can coast on this.
[18:56.800 --> 18:57.280]  I'll be fine.
[18:57.380 --> 18:59.840]  Especially as like Anime Expo was like a lot like that.
[19:00.080 --> 19:01.100]  One of my least favorite.
[19:01.280 --> 19:02.180]  One of my least favorite.
[19:02.180 --> 19:07.020]  It's probably the worst.
[19:09.680 --> 19:10.560]  You're crazy.
[19:10.800 --> 19:11.540]  That was nuts.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.340]  Well, Anime Expo, I think, is like a largely volunteer run convention.
[19:17.660 --> 19:18.820]  I thought you were going to say volunteer.
[19:18.940 --> 19:21.720]  And it's just run so poorly.
[19:21.920 --> 19:23.360]  It's just run so poorly.
[19:24.020 --> 19:26.300]  And it's a tough one.
[19:26.340 --> 19:27.680]  It's a tough one to do.
[19:28.020 --> 19:31.660]  It's just so funny that you mentioned it because it is literally the one I was referring to
[19:31.660 --> 19:34.880]  about trying to get my badge that was inside, but I couldn't do it without a badge.
[19:35.080 --> 19:36.680]  And I had to break in the loading dock in the back.
[19:38.820 --> 19:43.700]  It really, it's crazy too, because it's the convention that like when we were Mega64 and everything,
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.320]  we would do so well at Anime Expo.
[19:47.500 --> 19:48.480]  We would crush.
[19:48.820 --> 19:49.880]  We would fill the room.
[19:50.040 --> 19:51.100]  We would sell a ton of merchandise.
[19:51.380 --> 19:55.720]  Like it was a very, very strong convention, but it was always the conversation of like,
[19:56.140 --> 20:01.720]  okay, so who's going to be the one to go up like the day before with like a bunch of this stuff
[20:01.720 --> 20:09.340]  and figure out the ins and outs of how it's different from last year and how it's just so much worse.
[20:09.720 --> 20:11.500]  And that's the way it would go.
[20:11.640 --> 20:15.300]  But then we would have RTX at the same time and we would just go to, half of us would go to RTX,
[20:15.440 --> 20:16.400]  half of us go to Anime Expo.
[20:16.640 --> 20:18.040]  I never had to go to Anime Expo again.
[20:18.520 --> 20:21.080]  Yeah, that was one of my thing I really loved about RTX as well.
[20:21.200 --> 20:22.780]  It was the end of Anime Expo for me.
[20:23.040 --> 20:23.360]  Yeah.
[20:23.360 --> 20:32.200]  Crazy to think that somewhere in like Boston or Seattle or San Diego or Anaheim or wherever, San Jose,
[20:32.980 --> 20:40.620]  somewhere in 2011, 2012, 2013, the three of us were all hanging out, drinking beers and vodka
[20:40.620 --> 20:44.080]  behind a mountain of shirts at a convention center.
[20:45.400 --> 20:48.740]  Wouldn't it a million years have believed if you came up to us and told us the three of you
[20:48.740 --> 20:52.460]  are going to be watching some guy none of you know right now
[20:52.460 --> 20:56.800]  play a video game that you've never heard of or from your bedrooms
[20:57.500 --> 20:59.520]  and it's going to be your job.
[20:59.980 --> 21:02.480]  Just 11 years later, just FYI.
[21:04.420 --> 21:06.420]  Damn. Yep. Pretty crazy.
[21:07.080 --> 21:13.160]  I remember, I think it was Anime Expo, maybe 2007?
[21:16.500 --> 21:18.000]  Geoff was like, nah, I'm not going.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.540]  And then Geoff found out that the office move was going to be during the convention
[21:22.540 --> 21:24.340]  and suddenly he really wanted to go to it.
[21:24.340 --> 21:25.940]  Oh, that's awesome.
[21:26.220 --> 21:27.320]  That's the best part!
[21:28.040 --> 21:29.340]  Don't ruin my surprise.
[21:29.700 --> 21:31.420]  Come on man, you're giving away my trade secrets here.
[21:32.340 --> 21:33.640]  We've given that a seat in the crowd.
[21:33.960 --> 21:36.000]  I never moved the company.
[21:36.620 --> 21:37.920]  Oh my God.
[21:38.280 --> 21:40.100]  You told me that the first week.
[21:40.700 --> 21:42.700]  You're like, always be gone during a move.
[21:43.240 --> 21:47.660]  They didn't want to let me use the fridge in the downtown office
[21:47.660 --> 21:50.260]  because I didn't help them move it in and it was so hard to move.
[21:50.380 --> 21:54.100]  And I'm like, stop scheduling shit when I'm out of town at your conventions.
[21:54.320 --> 21:55.120]  What do you want from me?
[21:55.560 --> 21:57.560]  I'm doing work. I've got work to do.
[21:57.760 --> 22:00.300]  I'm sorry, I was out making thousands of dollars for the company.
[22:01.100 --> 22:05.020]  I apologize. I did this so we could afford to do these moves, guys.
[22:05.680 --> 22:06.340]  Yeah, my bad.
[22:10.060 --> 22:11.480]  Oh man, that's so funny.
[22:11.920 --> 22:12.640]  You cooking bullets?
[22:13.300 --> 22:14.320]  I'm cooking bullets!
[22:14.320 --> 22:17.260]  I'm going to improve the accuracy because I suck.
[22:20.760 --> 22:24.460]  I moved the podcast space like five times.
[22:24.860 --> 22:25.920]  Did you really?
[22:26.280 --> 22:26.960]  Yeah, I did.
[22:27.240 --> 22:33.040]  We had one spot before COVID and then we were back and forth between a couple of different facilities.
[22:33.660 --> 22:38.540]  And then there were three different rooms we used in stage four for the podcast space.
[22:38.820 --> 22:43.820]  Was the first one the one in the old Achievement Hunter room where it was next to my office
[22:43.820 --> 22:45.520]  where the Good Morning from Hell started?
[22:46.180 --> 22:48.180]  Yes. You could hear us in there.
[22:48.400 --> 22:53.040]  That's the reason podcasts got off the ground, because Geoff's office was just next to where we did podcasts.
[22:54.420 --> 22:55.300]  That's funny, I like that.
[22:55.300 --> 23:00.180]  The only reason we were a company for longer than we were going to be is Geoff going,
[23:00.220 --> 23:01.440]  Greenlight it! This is funny!
[23:03.820 --> 23:05.280]  The secrets that could come out now.
[23:05.740 --> 23:10.680]  It was pretty fortuitous that I finally decided I deserved an office after all those years
[23:10.680 --> 23:12.640]  and I took Gavin's old one because he didn't want it anymore.
[23:12.640 --> 23:16.280]  And it just happened to be next to Blaine and Chris being funny.
[23:16.780 --> 23:21.280]  It was me, Blaine, Chris, and Nick in that room just doing like...
[23:21.280 --> 23:25.060]  I guess we'll just try to record this stuff and then have like a guest on every so often.
[23:25.160 --> 23:26.420]  It was fun, man. It was really good.
[23:26.600 --> 23:28.100]  And now it's back. Good Morning from Hell came back.
[23:28.480 --> 23:31.460]  Yeah, that's so cool. Gus and I filmed a little thing with him. It was cool.
[23:32.100 --> 23:34.420]  Yeah, we got to hear a story about Chris. It was pretty exciting.
[23:34.580 --> 23:35.660]  Oh my God, dude.
[23:35.860 --> 23:37.120]  I heard about the story.
[23:38.080 --> 23:39.080]  Oh no!
[23:40.380 --> 23:42.100]  He was going to throw a bottle.
[23:42.660 --> 23:46.680]  I told the guys from 100% Eat Yesterday the Chris in Chicago story.
[23:47.240 --> 23:53.000]  It was four guys in a car, one guy explaining it, three guys getting pissed.
[23:55.080 --> 24:01.500]  The crazy thing about it too is like Chris explains it in such a way where he's confusing himself while he explains it.
[24:01.580 --> 24:04.280]  But also he's looking at you like...
[24:04.280 --> 24:05.100]  I know, right?
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.680]  It's completely rational and you're supposed to be on his side somehow throughout this.
[24:10.980 --> 24:16.560]  He has that look where he puts his arms out to the side and kind of his open mouth and his eyes get big.
[24:16.760 --> 24:20.560]  And kind of like shakes his head from left to right like, I know!
[24:20.900 --> 24:23.020]  And it's like no one here is agreeing with you.
[24:23.080 --> 24:24.160]  We don't. We don't know.
[24:24.980 --> 24:27.580]  Isn't that crazy? How could that happen?
[24:27.800 --> 24:29.600]  Oh man, there's another guy right there.
[24:31.880 --> 24:34.320]  Nice! I thought there was another guy walking with him.
[24:34.320 --> 24:36.060]  Kill him. Take him out. Waste him.
[24:36.280 --> 24:38.580]  Oh yeah, Hitman style. Put him in a freezer.
[24:39.220 --> 24:39.780]  I know!
[24:40.800 --> 24:44.380]  The only thing missing from this game is the Hitman dropping the dumpster mechanic.
[24:46.900 --> 24:50.320]  So what happened at the end of the Conor McGregor thing? He's like alive still or something?
[24:51.720 --> 24:53.200]  Yeah, he just wakes up.
[24:53.700 --> 24:54.100]  What?
[24:55.520 --> 24:56.200]  In the hospital.
[25:00.120 --> 25:01.100]  That doesn't make any sense.
[25:01.100 --> 25:03.140]  What if he just walked up and shot him?
[25:03.140 --> 25:03.980]  You gotta have a rematch.
[25:05.360 --> 25:06.740]  It's too much money in the sequel.
[25:07.200 --> 25:07.760]  Come on.
[25:08.000 --> 25:08.840]  It's UFC 101.
[25:09.740 --> 25:09.800]  Crazy.
[25:13.150 --> 25:19.370]  It's definitely a thing where it's like the only way I'll do this is if I live.
[25:20.070 --> 25:23.050]  In a game where you have to kill people.
[25:23.170 --> 25:24.790]  Yeah, the goal is to kill me.
[25:24.970 --> 25:26.590]  But I'll only do this if I live.
[25:27.190 --> 25:28.510]  Everyone goes, okay.
[25:31.110 --> 25:32.650]  Nick, you're nailing this so far.
[25:32.650 --> 25:33.650]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[25:33.810 --> 25:36.670]  I wish you hadn't called attention to me or anything that was happening.
[25:36.830 --> 25:37.350]  You can save.
[25:38.190 --> 25:39.470]  That's exactly what I was thinking.
[25:42.030 --> 25:43.230]  Which way are you going to go?
[25:47.590 --> 25:49.330]  Well, that was an unfortunate noise.
[25:52.450 --> 25:53.090]  Oh, shit.
[25:53.650 --> 25:54.290]  Oh, shit.
[25:55.050 --> 25:56.610]  Oh, shit. Oh, man. Oh, shit.
[25:57.110 --> 25:58.770]  Oh, you got it. You got it.
[25:58.830 --> 25:59.790]  Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[25:59.910 --> 26:01.790]  And you can put your power armor on right there, too.
[26:02.310 --> 26:03.290]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:05.690 --> 26:07.810]  I can start to build a turret defense.
[26:08.090 --> 26:09.670]  Yeah, I'm the Wanderer.
[26:13.390 --> 26:13.790]  Okay.
[26:14.670 --> 26:15.350]  Oh, balls.
[26:16.510 --> 26:16.910]  Dodge.
[26:17.150 --> 26:18.690]  Oh, you stupid...
[26:20.150 --> 26:21.550]  This is not looking great.
[26:21.950 --> 26:22.570]  Throw everything.
[26:23.890 --> 26:24.750]  Is this just a plant?
[26:24.750 --> 26:25.130]  Mousetrap bomb.
[26:25.770 --> 26:26.750]  Oh, it's a mousetrap.
[26:27.450 --> 26:28.630]  You gotta build a better one.
[26:30.770 --> 26:32.270]  That's the name of the game, baby.
[26:36.770 --> 26:39.450]  It looked like you shot yourself in the face.
[26:43.620 --> 26:46.400]  No! It made me restart it!
[26:46.600 --> 26:49.040]  Why? Load from your load. Is it...
[26:49.040 --> 26:51.020]  Yeah, let's see if it does that.
[26:51.240 --> 26:52.220]  I bet it just loads from here.
[26:52.880 --> 26:54.720]  Why does it... Okay, let's find out.
[26:55.960 --> 26:56.120]  Yep.
[26:57.080 --> 26:57.560]  Sweet.
[26:58.360 --> 26:58.840]  Sweet!
[26:59.500 --> 26:59.980]  Sweet.
[27:00.760 --> 27:01.240]  Sweet.
[27:02.120 --> 27:02.600]  Sweet.
[27:03.360 --> 27:08.620]  Alright, well, let's do me... future me a favor and go ahead and reload this.
[27:09.040 --> 27:14.000]  I'm gonna... we're gonna... I figure we're like 30 minutes away from Nickel and I'll just drink the invisibility potion.
[27:14.580 --> 27:16.400]  There's an invisibility potion?!
[27:17.280 --> 27:20.540]  Oh, hold on. Now that you mention it, let me check some crafting.
[27:20.920 --> 27:21.140]  Okay.
[27:23.100 --> 27:27.660]  He's like, oh man, I guess I should use that phoenix down I've been holding on to.
[27:30.200 --> 27:32.220]  Oh yeah, I can resurrect myself. Whoops, no.
[27:34.380 --> 27:36.200]  Oh, damn it, Dina, you scared the fuck out of me.
[27:36.220 --> 27:38.660]  I did all my upgrades in Predator.
[27:39.720 --> 27:40.660]  Are you a little badass now?
[27:40.940 --> 27:45.840]  I mean, you can like change the way you look and stuff and then you can change like...
[27:45.840 --> 27:48.680]  Some of like the looks to your guns, but like there's not really much of a change.
[27:48.760 --> 27:50.740]  I changed like my sidearm, the look of my character.
[27:51.620 --> 27:54.540]  It takes... it just takes a bit to unlock stuff kind of like Call of Duty.
[27:54.540 --> 27:59.380]  Like I have a scope now on my gun and I just unlocked extra mag.
[27:59.560 --> 28:00.720]  So now I have extra ammo.
[28:01.160 --> 28:03.260]  And then you have perks as well.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.260]  They're pretty cool.
[28:11.870 --> 28:15.870]  No idea when that's going to come out for the Twitch audience here.
[28:15.930 --> 28:17.510]  But man, did we have fun playing Predator.
[28:17.710 --> 28:19.770]  Can't believe how much fun it was.
[28:19.970 --> 28:24.030]  Hard to convince Eric to play anything other than GTA, but once we did, he was in it.
[28:24.490 --> 28:26.410]  Yeah, but I mean, we could be playing GTA.
[28:29.990 --> 28:32.750]  Dude, I also have the GTA addiction.
[28:33.110 --> 28:33.330]  Yeah!
[28:33.810 --> 28:37.650]  I reinstalled the PC version that I have.
[28:37.990 --> 28:40.730]  I'm ready to fucking uninstall it again after that ghost.
[28:45.230 --> 28:49.030]  I had like 11 million bucks just sitting there that I hadn't used.
[28:49.090 --> 28:50.950]  Fucking four times, I'm not doing it again.
[28:54.120 --> 28:55.020]  So cool.
[28:55.340 --> 28:57.040]  Hey, thanks for the sub, Razgriz.
[28:57.900 --> 28:59.100]  What's up, Razgriz?
[28:59.380 --> 29:00.640]  You guys talking to Razgriz in here?
[29:00.840 --> 29:01.780]  Yeah, we're Razgriz-ing.
[29:01.780 --> 29:02.140]  Razgriz!
[29:02.420 --> 29:02.660]  Damn.
[29:04.280 --> 29:04.800]  Got him.
[29:05.500 --> 29:07.340]  God, Jesus Christ, man.
[29:07.660 --> 29:09.740]  That's what it's like to drive around with you, Nick.
[29:09.980 --> 29:11.040]  Oh, you know what?
[29:11.500 --> 29:13.300]  Yeah, he just screams.
[29:13.720 --> 29:22.340]  So we did, we have a show for 100% E called Ride Along, where it's just filming us in the car going to get the food or coming back or whatever.
[29:22.620 --> 29:24.280]  And we went to Jack in the Box.
[29:24.800 --> 29:28.420]  We're driving in a parking lot and Nick just all of a sudden goes...
[29:30.040 --> 29:33.400]  And it's like, oh fuck, like slamming on the brake, oh shit.
[29:33.580 --> 29:35.980]  And he just goes, sourdough breakfast, Jack.
[29:36.140 --> 29:39.540]  And it was like, are you fucking kidding me?
[29:40.960 --> 29:41.920]  Like, what?
[29:42.640 --> 29:43.100]  What?
[29:43.780 --> 29:44.800]  Squealing to a halt.
[29:44.900 --> 29:46.660]  I was furious.
[29:47.560 --> 29:48.500]  Yeah, he was a little mad.
[29:50.840 --> 29:52.660]  Freelancing, subbed with Prime.
[29:53.220 --> 29:53.640]  Nice.
[29:53.640 --> 29:55.100]  Cheers for the three months.
[29:55.580 --> 29:58.840]  He told the dude at the counter when he asked me for something and I said...
[29:58.840 --> 30:00.680]  That's a trimester, that three months.
[30:01.620 --> 30:02.420]  Nice trimester.
[30:04.140 --> 30:06.560]  He goes, I'm so fucking sick of this guy.
[30:07.340 --> 30:08.760]  The dude at the cash register.
[30:09.960 --> 30:12.500]  They asked if they wanted anything and Nick just goes, Jalapenos.
[30:12.960 --> 30:15.620]  And they're like, what does that mean?
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.400]  And to the guy working there, I said, I'm so fucking sick of this guy.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.200]  It's just a moment of realness.
[30:29.860 --> 30:31.120]  You fell over.
[30:32.460 --> 30:33.920]  You fell over again.
[30:34.980 --> 30:37.280]  We should get a trimester emote.
[30:40.660 --> 30:42.100]  When you hit your trimester.
[30:44.700 --> 30:50.060]  My favorite thing to do when you go into a fast food restaurant, which I never do anymore,
[30:50.860 --> 30:55.620]  is to have a conversation with somebody, whatever, like Gavin, you're having a conversation and you let them go first.
[30:55.740 --> 30:58.460]  And then they go up and they have the little banter with the person and they walk away.
[30:58.820 --> 31:01.740]  And then you walk up and you go, do you know that? Who the fuck was that?
[31:02.460 --> 31:03.940]  And they're always like, I don't know.
[31:04.040 --> 31:05.060]  I'm like, yeah, I don't know, weird.
[31:07.260 --> 31:08.560]  Fuck yeah, throw him under the bus.
[31:10.480 --> 31:12.000]  Is that a bunch of spilled petrol?
[31:14.880 --> 31:15.440]  I don't...
[31:15.440 --> 31:17.120]  Should we waste this life and find out?
[31:17.580 --> 31:18.640]  Yeah, you can try.
[31:18.640 --> 31:20.360]  I just, I don't think it, I don't think it'll...
[31:20.360 --> 31:21.480]  God damn it, I didn't reload.
[31:22.260 --> 31:23.060]  Jesus Christ.
[31:23.060 --> 31:24.320]  He's going to do future me a favor.
[31:24.540 --> 31:27.160]  Yeah, I didn't think that was going to work.
[31:27.540 --> 31:28.280]  It's probably water.
[31:28.280 --> 31:29.800]  Well, it is Seattle, so...
[31:29.800 --> 31:30.060]  Oh!
[31:30.860 --> 31:32.160]  Ow! Foot pit!
[31:32.440 --> 31:33.600]  Oh man.
[31:34.220 --> 31:35.340]  Oh God, oh man.
[31:37.100 --> 31:37.640]  The windmills.
[31:40.600 --> 31:41.960]  Alright, let's try that again.
[31:43.780 --> 31:45.840]  I think the method you were going was working.
[31:46.080 --> 31:46.820]  I think so.
[31:46.820 --> 31:49.400]  Not the way you were handling it's been fine.
[31:50.060 --> 31:56.820]  You just start falling apart because there's a guy kind of like out of nowhere and then you don't know how to handle it and that's, that's fine.
[31:57.400 --> 31:58.200]  Ooh, a drawer.
[31:58.960 --> 31:59.900]  Ooh, a bottle.
[32:02.080 --> 32:05.960]  Yeah, you do good until the shit hits the fan and then...
[32:05.960 --> 32:09.220]  But, but the thing is, he still does good when the shit hits the fan.
[32:09.620 --> 32:11.980]  It's the, it's the thing after the shit hits the fan.
[32:12.120 --> 32:14.360]  Oh, there's two, there's two shits right there.
[32:14.360 --> 32:18.660]  The first step is always so good and then the second step you go, did you, what happened?
[32:19.160 --> 32:21.560]  I'm still, I'm learning their paths.
[32:21.760 --> 32:22.400]  I'm learning.
[32:22.860 --> 32:23.500]  I'm learning.
[32:23.860 --> 32:25.160]  Their paths, okay.
[32:25.800 --> 32:28.460]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[32:28.500 --> 32:28.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:28.740 --> 32:30.740]  Kill, end, end their life.
[32:31.340 --> 32:32.260]  Oh my God.
[32:32.800 --> 32:36.000]  You take it from them. That's yours now, that's your life Nick.
[32:36.360 --> 32:36.480]  Oh, for sure.
[32:36.480 --> 32:37.080]  That belongs to you.
[32:37.960 --> 32:39.460]  Take that ear, you're gonna need that.
[32:39.500 --> 32:39.660]  Dibs.
[32:40.200 --> 32:40.820]  Take the ear?
[32:40.980 --> 32:42.000]  What the, oh right.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.320]  You're going to build a new Joel.
[32:44.720 --> 32:46.360]  We're going to do it one body at a time.
[32:50.140 --> 32:53.240]  Alright, let's wait for her to do her thing.
[32:53.860 --> 32:56.260]  She walks through the break room.
[32:57.320 --> 32:58.540]  What can I make?
[33:03.830 --> 33:04.450]  Where are you?
[33:04.570 --> 33:06.510]  Oh no! She went the wrong way!
[33:06.790 --> 33:07.310]  Oh no!
[33:08.070 --> 33:11.210]  It got like looking left and right.
[33:11.890 --> 33:12.750]  She went the wrong way.
[33:13.310 --> 33:13.930]  Grab that.
[33:14.590 --> 33:16.930]  It's okay, we'll just change...
[33:18.590 --> 33:21.270]  the routing here a little bit.
[33:21.730 --> 33:23.690]  Alright Gavin, those shirts are on order, buddy.
[33:24.970 --> 33:25.450]  Sick!
[33:27.470 --> 33:28.550]  Did the email come through?
[33:29.550 --> 33:31.890]  How did you get it before me?
[33:31.950 --> 33:32.430]  I sent it.
[33:34.950 --> 33:37.090]  I paid a dollar for Priory.
[33:38.610 --> 33:39.810]  I got it at $4.29.
[33:40.690 --> 33:41.950]  They're ordering, we're good.
[33:44.530 --> 33:46.110]  I'm excited to be doing this with
[33:46.950 --> 33:48.050]  the company and everything.
[33:48.790 --> 33:49.430]  This is good.
[33:49.790 --> 33:51.790]  I'm excited about it as well.
[33:51.890 --> 33:53.410]  I'm happy to be at this point.
[33:53.550 --> 33:55.850]  I was conveying yesterday.
[33:56.290 --> 33:57.970]  This was my favorite thing I did in the company.
[33:58.110 --> 33:58.370]  Probably.
[33:59.990 --> 34:01.930]  In terms of behind the scenes stuff.
[34:02.770 --> 34:04.470]  It's fun to be back at it again.
[34:06.110 --> 34:07.290]  People love this stuff
[34:07.290 --> 34:08.930]  in the fourth trimester of the year.
[34:10.390 --> 34:11.310]  That's true, they do.
[34:12.430 --> 34:13.810]  That's the shopping trimester.
[34:13.810 --> 34:17.070]  Gavin was going swimming in the fourth trimester.
[34:18.470 --> 34:19.410]  Q4 swim.
[34:20.110 --> 34:21.570]  Wait, be patient.
[34:23.330 --> 34:25.030]  Are you reloaded?
[34:25.810 --> 34:26.410]  Yeah, I'm reloaded.
[34:29.150 --> 34:30.350]  Oh, damn!
[34:32.590 --> 34:34.490]  This is a bad time to say that
[34:34.490 --> 34:36.910]  DPalo12 said if Nick does it this run
[34:36.910 --> 34:38.210]  I'll gift five subs.
[34:38.690 --> 34:39.070]  Oh, no!
[34:39.910 --> 34:41.670]  This time make it ten.
[34:42.460 --> 34:42.930]  Envy him.
[34:43.570 --> 34:45.990]  Think about the amount of trimester celebrations
[34:45.990 --> 34:46.970]  we could have just had then.
[34:48.490 --> 34:50.670]  Make it ten on this run.
[34:53.150 --> 34:54.810]  Is that how it works?
[34:55.970 --> 34:57.410]  I'll see you're awesome.
[34:57.950 --> 35:00.070]  I'll tie this and challenge you to double it.
[35:00.490 --> 35:02.950]  Nick saying, I'm negotiating.
[35:03.470 --> 35:03.930]  I'm negotiating.
[35:04.850 --> 35:06.430]  What I just did is what Trump
[35:06.430 --> 35:07.890]  is going to do on the Undertaker podcast.
[35:08.370 --> 35:10.630]  Nothing like double or nothing on generosity.
[35:12.630 --> 35:14.430]  Yeah, Nick's kind of like Trump
[35:14.430 --> 35:15.870]  on the Undertaker's podcast.
[35:16.110 --> 35:18.510]  Sure, you're kind.
[35:18.730 --> 35:20.070]  But I bet you could be kinder.
[35:22.150 --> 35:23.110]  Oh, man.
[35:24.230 --> 35:25.730]  The sneak attacks are so
[35:25.730 --> 35:26.710]  unsatisfying in this game.
[35:26.790 --> 35:31.850]  It almost feels like there is no sneak attack.
[35:32.430 --> 35:34.630]  But there definitely is.
[35:34.870 --> 35:36.070]  It doesn't feel like that's...
[35:36.070 --> 35:38.390]  I don't remember it that much.
[35:39.030 --> 35:40.090]  I don't remember everyone
[35:40.090 --> 35:41.750]  turning around every time I tried to grab them.
[35:41.790 --> 35:42.730]  Do you think it's just Nick?
[35:43.390 --> 35:44.470]  I'm not going to say that,
[35:45.570 --> 35:46.750]  but I'm going to think it really loud.
[35:47.850 --> 35:49.570]  I mean, yeah, okay.
[35:51.790 --> 35:54.570]  That's a pretty efficient stack of trays.
[35:55.430 --> 35:55.810]  It is.
[35:56.270 --> 35:57.870]  And it survived the apocalypse.
[35:58.090 --> 35:58.670]  Think about that.
[35:59.270 --> 36:00.450]  I don't think you could do better than that.
[36:01.390 --> 36:01.930]  PFAS my ass.
[36:05.010 --> 36:05.430]  Crazy.
[36:12.040 --> 36:14.280]  Yeah, somebody said it's just because Grounded is super sensitive,
[36:14.380 --> 36:15.240]  so they notice it more.
[36:16.620 --> 36:18.680]  It's been such a goddamn stupid day.
[36:19.280 --> 36:21.800]  It is a weird one, but I'm having fun.
[36:21.800 --> 36:23.740]  Just a bunch of nonsense all day long.
[36:24.160 --> 36:24.860]  That's great.
[36:26.240 --> 36:27.760]  Come on! There you are.
[36:28.680 --> 36:29.960]  Any chance of getting Gracie on
[36:29.960 --> 36:32.440]  regulation pod or stream in the not too distant future?
[36:32.740 --> 36:33.220]  She's busy.
[36:33.600 --> 36:34.480]  She's very busy.
[36:35.060 --> 36:38.280]  I talked to her the other day, and she's just been
[36:38.280 --> 36:39.960]  very wrapped up.
[36:39.960 --> 36:41.540]  I will say I'm keeping her alive
[36:41.540 --> 36:43.000]  in the slack.
[36:43.440 --> 36:43.920]  Yeah.
[36:45.340 --> 36:46.080]  That's true.
[36:47.880 --> 36:48.360]  Oh!
[36:50.620 --> 36:52.300]  They may not die today, but they'll die soon.
[36:52.780 --> 36:53.680]  Oh shit!
[36:53.840 --> 36:54.580]  We're fucked!
[36:55.740 --> 36:56.220]  Imagine
[36:58.140 --> 36:59.760]  that's the last thing you hear.
[37:01.220 --> 37:01.960]  Throw a bangy
[37:01.960 --> 37:03.780]  and then three shotty.
[37:04.860 --> 37:05.140]  Uh oh.
[37:06.340 --> 37:07.300]  Let's just put that here.
[37:07.860 --> 37:08.780]  There you go.
[37:11.540 --> 37:13.560]  That was a sad way to die.
[37:17.780 --> 37:20.600]  Okay, here we go.
[37:22.180 --> 37:23.660]  Maybe you could save.
[37:25.920 --> 37:26.980]  You know what?
[37:27.220 --> 37:28.620]  We'll try it again this time. How about that?
[37:29.220 --> 37:30.880]  We'll see if it saves again.
[37:30.880 --> 37:31.840]  How does that save?
[37:35.940 --> 37:37.660]  I think I have to hit a checkpoint
[37:37.660 --> 37:38.940]  to save.
[37:42.220 --> 37:43.020]  ZS Larmore
[37:43.480 --> 37:43.880]  says,
[37:43.980 --> 37:45.820]  Hey Geoff, love the NBA preview on Saul Wright.
[37:45.860 --> 37:47.840]  Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. He's a Hornets fan.
[37:48.060 --> 37:49.620]  Ug, appreciate the Brandon Miller talk.
[37:49.860 --> 37:52.740]  The Hornets are not supposed to perform well at all.
[37:52.800 --> 37:54.180]  I just heard the Bill Simmons
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.160]  NBA over-under preview.
[37:56.320 --> 37:57.420]  They were dunking pretty hard.
[37:57.420 --> 37:59.400]  I am somehow
[37:59.400 --> 38:01.460]  optimistic. I think you've got a little
[38:01.460 --> 38:03.480]  bit of a... I think there's some sort of
[38:03.480 --> 38:05.420]  a light at the end of your tunnel. I think it's going to go
[38:05.420 --> 38:06.340]  better than people expect.
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.440]  What's with the... Does it feel
[38:09.440 --> 38:11.160]  like the over-under for the Thunder
[38:11.160 --> 38:12.080]  is really low?
[38:13.300 --> 38:15.520]  I think it's just because there's
[38:15.520 --> 38:17.380]  such a fucking
[38:18.460 --> 38:19.320]  logjam of talent
[38:19.320 --> 38:21.460]  in the West this year. I just think everybody's better.
[38:21.720 --> 38:22.280]  But the Thunder,
[38:23.640 --> 38:25.540]  they're going to lose to the Celtics in the
[38:25.540 --> 38:26.920]  finals. They're going to do very well this year.
[38:27.360 --> 38:29.500]  Easily going to win the West. Easily going to win the West.
[38:29.800 --> 38:30.860]  Definitely the best team in the West.
[38:31.220 --> 38:33.080]  The Spurs might be on their way back, baby.
[38:33.320 --> 38:35.480]  Oklahoma City Thunder, by far, the best team in the West.
[38:36.180 --> 38:38.080]  No offense to your team, Nick.
[38:38.660 --> 38:39.540]  The Spurs, yeah.
[38:39.560 --> 38:40.720]  They added all those
[38:41.380 --> 38:43.500]  big-time parts. Nick, your team
[38:43.500 --> 38:45.120]  has the 12th best team in the West.
[38:47.540 --> 38:49.220]  Gavin's disrespect for the
[38:49.220 --> 38:51.620]  Sour Patch Kid and Blowpipe
[38:51.620 --> 38:53.700]  was appalling. The Sour Patch Kid was disgusting.
[38:53.700 --> 38:55.040]  I don't know what Blowpipe is.
[38:56.300 --> 38:56.940]  Blowpipe's different.
[38:57.460 --> 38:59.400]  That was filth. Blowpipe?
[39:00.400 --> 39:02.020]  I didn't partake
[39:02.020 --> 39:02.620]  in a Blowpipe.
[39:04.180 --> 39:04.900]  That's different.
[39:06.260 --> 39:07.740]  Don't ask us about the World Series.
[39:08.160 --> 39:09.300]  The baseball season ended already.
[39:09.320 --> 39:11.640]  Baseball's over. What are you talking about?
[39:11.840 --> 39:12.980]  The Yankees are playing right now, right?
[39:13.300 --> 39:15.480]  No, I don't think so. I think baseball's over. Dude, how cool is a
[39:15.480 --> 39:17.560]  Dodgers-Yankees World Series going to be?
[39:18.080 --> 39:19.680]  Pretty awful. Yeah, not cool
[39:19.680 --> 39:21.780]  at all. Pretty awful.
[39:21.780 --> 39:23.720]  I gotta say, Mets-Yankees would be pretty cool
[39:23.720 --> 39:25.700]  too, but I would much rather see the Dodgers
[39:25.700 --> 39:25.920]  win.
[39:30.040 --> 39:31.680]  Oh, what a grab!
[39:32.460 --> 39:34.160]  Shut your mouth. Shut up. Not you, her.
[39:35.780 --> 39:36.620]  I did not think
[39:36.620 --> 39:37.440]  you were talking to me.
[39:37.980 --> 39:39.260]  I didn't think you were talking to me at all.
[39:40.140 --> 39:41.960]  Why don't you grab what she has and then
[39:42.450 --> 39:43.800]  hang out in the tall grass for a while.
[39:44.720 --> 39:46.500]  Instead of just hanging out in the garage.
[39:46.840 --> 39:48.560]  Hang out in the tall poppies
[39:48.560 --> 39:50.300]  as they say. I'm a raptor.
[39:50.600 --> 39:52.440]  Be a tall poppy. Is this what you
[39:52.440 --> 39:54.420]  think raptors do? Nick, I
[39:54.420 --> 39:56.340]  challenge you to not stand up for the rest of the
[39:56.340 --> 39:57.120]  stream.
[39:58.280 --> 39:59.740]  Nick, I challenge you to win.
[40:01.060 --> 40:02.560]  Can I aim a gun
[40:02.560 --> 40:03.960]  from here? Oh, I can.
[40:04.160 --> 40:06.420]  Of course. No need to bother with legs.
[40:08.300 --> 40:08.540]  Okay.
[40:14.940 --> 40:16.200]  Thank you, MarkTheFrog.
[40:16.200 --> 40:18.280]  That's insane. Dude, is MarkTheFrog
[40:18.280 --> 40:20.940]  here? Yeah, he is. Dude, MarkTheFrog
[40:20.940 --> 40:22.680]  rocks. He's
[40:22.680 --> 40:25.300]  said nice things about you. MarkTheFrog
[40:25.300 --> 40:27.000]  is awesome. I was streaming
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.020]  one day on Twitch. We were playing like this
[40:29.020 --> 40:31.060]  wrestling game. MarkTheFrog found the
[40:31.060 --> 40:33.040]  channel. Doesn't know anything about any of
[40:33.040 --> 40:34.960]  this stuff, whatever. Just came in and
[40:34.960 --> 40:37.000]  started going, hey, if anyone has any plumbing
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.080]  or HVAC questions,
[40:38.740 --> 40:40.480]  you know, that's what I do.
[40:40.880 --> 40:43.040]  I'm also going to eat a dozen hard-boiled eggs.
[40:43.480 --> 40:45.100]  And then we went, I don't know
[40:45.100 --> 40:47.060]  who this guy is. This rocks.
[40:47.680 --> 40:48.940]  MarkTheFrog just hangs
[40:48.940 --> 40:51.000]  out, does not know. He's like,
[40:51.080 --> 40:52.960]  hey, Eric, should I listen to what your podcasts
[40:52.960 --> 40:54.940]  are? What are they? And he doesn't know
[40:54.940 --> 40:56.460]  about any of this stuff. He does now.
[40:56.760 --> 40:59.060]  He's listened to all of it, he said. Dude, MarkTheFrog
[40:59.060 --> 41:00.820]  rocks. I love MarkTheFrog. How did the eggs
[41:00.820 --> 41:02.940]  go? You know, pretty good. He just tells
[41:02.940 --> 41:04.840]  us about how much protein he eats in a day. It's
[41:04.840 --> 41:06.680]  pretty exciting. Imagine a dude just
[41:06.680 --> 41:08.780]  rolling into a random Twitch channel because
[41:08.780 --> 41:10.840]  he's into eating eggs and he discovers
[41:10.840 --> 41:12.280]  the Anne Egg podcast.
[41:13.360 --> 41:15.000]  You an egg fan, bro? That's meant to happen.
[41:15.000 --> 41:15.500]  That's pretty cool.
[41:16.280 --> 41:17.620]  I'm afraid that I'm
[41:17.620 --> 41:18.840]  going to have to break.
[41:20.080 --> 41:21.380]  I don't know why you went
[41:21.380 --> 41:23.540]  backwards. I don't know why you
[41:23.540 --> 41:25.480]  didn't save. Like, you were
[41:25.480 --> 41:26.900]  sneaking out. Oh, I didn't. He was doing
[41:27.480 --> 41:28.120]  great, right?
[41:29.500 --> 41:30.880]  That guy is so out.
[41:30.880 --> 41:34.120]  You dropped your weapon. Grab the hatchet!
[41:34.220 --> 41:35.180]  Grab the hatchet! Grab the hatchet!
[41:35.340 --> 41:35.980]  You should heal.
[41:37.140 --> 41:38.900]  I don't have any health. Oh, shit!
[41:39.380 --> 41:41.000]  Oh, balls! Oh, Pinsir!
[41:41.220 --> 41:43.500]  Pinsir! Pinsir! You're getting crazy.
[41:44.240 --> 41:45.620]  Oh, okay. Let's just go back to
[41:45.620 --> 41:47.560]  the beginning of the map. At some point, they can't
[41:47.560 --> 41:49.220]  follow you. Don't have heals.
[41:50.660 --> 41:51.240]  Go find
[41:51.740 --> 41:53.640]  potato chips. Hold on, let's see.
[41:53.700 --> 41:55.480]  We'll see if I have heals. I don't have anything
[41:55.480 --> 41:56.840]  to craft heals. I don't have the heals.
[41:58.300 --> 41:59.600]  What's that? Is that just a
[41:59.600 --> 42:01.580]  bottle? Yeah, I'm just going to drink my
[42:01.580 --> 42:02.440]  problems away right now.
[42:04.280 --> 42:04.860]  It's empty.
[42:06.180 --> 42:07.000]  Yeah, that sucks.
[42:07.940 --> 42:08.300]  Clamato.
[42:09.480 --> 42:09.840]  Alright.
[42:09.840 --> 42:10.040]  Alright.
[42:11.520 --> 42:12.560]  Honest mistake.
[42:13.380 --> 42:15.360]  I was talking about how nervous I was.
[42:16.300 --> 42:17.560]  And I had to pee.
[42:18.960 --> 42:19.840]  Uh-oh.
[42:20.180 --> 42:22.320]  Don't look behind this human-sized
[42:22.320 --> 42:24.020]  craze. No BPAs
[42:24.020 --> 42:26.020]  back here. Uh-oh.
[42:26.820 --> 42:27.660]  It's going to be all
[42:27.660 --> 42:28.640]  plastic jokes all day.
[42:28.960 --> 42:31.860]  Why would you even think
[42:31.860 --> 42:33.860]  about it? Just smash him in the head with it.
[42:33.980 --> 42:35.160]  There you go. There you go.
[42:35.420 --> 42:35.860]  Yeah.
[42:36.700 --> 42:37.780]  Now let him
[42:37.780 --> 42:39.780]  choke to death on his own blood. Oh, shoot him.
[42:39.920 --> 42:41.520]  Keep shooting him. Do you have ammo?
[42:42.420 --> 42:43.920]  Let her waste
[42:43.920 --> 42:44.300]  her ammo.
[42:45.480 --> 42:47.200]  Does she run out of ammo at some point?
[42:47.760 --> 42:49.300]  Oh, she got him.
[42:49.660 --> 42:50.000]  Save.
[42:52.080 --> 42:53.240]  He's bleeding out.
[42:56.700 --> 42:57.860]  That's the one time
[42:57.860 --> 42:59.480]  she's been like... useful?
[42:59.780 --> 43:01.880]  Yeah. Wow, I cannot
[43:01.880 --> 43:04.880]  believe you made it through that way. That's
[43:04.880 --> 43:07.080]  huge, dude. Yeah, congratulations, man.
[43:07.180 --> 43:08.900]  Oh, thanks, man. Time to start
[43:08.900 --> 43:10.880]  looking around for shit. That was
[43:10.880 --> 43:12.600]  real big boy stuff right there.
[43:12.720 --> 43:14.680]  You deployed some big boy moves
[43:14.680 --> 43:15.820]  and some big boy tactics.
[43:16.680 --> 43:18.860]  Oh, it worked out really well letting someone else do the
[43:18.860 --> 43:20.840]  dirty work. That's what big
[43:20.840 --> 43:22.260]  boys do. Oh, yeah.
[43:23.460 --> 43:25.120]  I delegated. I'm a boss now.
[43:25.460 --> 43:27.200]  Oh, wow. You're a producer?
[43:27.460 --> 43:28.840]  Way to go, buddy. Oh, I
[43:28.840 --> 43:29.400]  did it.
[43:31.560 --> 43:32.240]  A bottle.
[43:32.240 --> 43:34.260]  I think you're going to find a lot of
[43:34.260 --> 43:36.220]  stuff through here. I think there's a vending machine out there
[43:36.220 --> 43:38.560]  where there's probably some
[43:38.560 --> 43:39.880]  food, some snackies.
[43:40.080 --> 43:42.100]  Mark the Frog eats 18 eggs a week. That's
[43:42.100 --> 43:44.300]  hot dog numbers. Dude, Mark the Frog
[43:44.300 --> 43:46.140]  he's just like, yeah, what's up? I'm in an
[43:46.140 --> 43:47.980]  attic right now. This is a good stream.
[43:48.460 --> 43:49.920]  I'm in an attic right now. I got
[43:49.920 --> 43:51.780]  seven hot dogs and three eggs.
[43:52.140 --> 43:54.180]  I'm glad that... I think Mark
[43:54.180 --> 43:56.120]  the Frog is in the American Southeast
[43:56.120 --> 43:58.280]  so I'm glad that the hurricane did not
[43:58.280 --> 44:00.400]  affect him too, too much. Didn't defrog
[44:00.400 --> 44:01.860]  him. Yeah. Didn't
[44:02.400 --> 44:03.600]  he's built for the water.
[44:04.180 --> 44:06.360]  Oh, yeah. Oh, come
[44:06.360 --> 44:07.940]  on, man. Oh, man.
[44:07.960 --> 44:10.320]  Oh, man. What's the
[44:10.320 --> 44:12.180]  format of the 18 eggs? Are they just 18
[44:12.180 --> 44:14.320]  boiled eggs? Yeah, hard-boiled eggs. And he's
[44:14.320 --> 44:15.960]  just eating them. He's got to eat...
[44:15.960 --> 44:18.040]  He's like, I have to eat so much
[44:18.040 --> 44:19.800]  protein in a day.
[44:20.020 --> 44:21.980]  He's just like a big guy. He goes crazy.
[44:22.220 --> 44:24.240]  He just loves it. I don't
[44:24.240 --> 44:26.380]  get how people don't like hard-boiled
[44:26.380 --> 44:27.880]  eggs. Dude, they're so good.
[44:27.880 --> 44:29.660]  I didn't start liking them
[44:29.660 --> 44:31.100]  well into my 20s.
[44:31.340 --> 44:33.480]  I feel like I went off on them as a kid.
[44:34.460 --> 44:35.760]  I love a hard-boiled egg.
[44:35.760 --> 44:37.640]  Nice hard-boiled egg with some salt on it.
[44:37.800 --> 44:38.540]  Mmm. Mmm.
[44:39.420 --> 44:41.900]  A little bit of mustard. How do you feel about deviled?
[44:42.320 --> 44:43.880]  I love a deviled. I can eat 30
[44:43.880 --> 44:45.600]  of them. I don't really like a deviled egg.
[44:46.320 --> 44:47.780]  I love a deviled egg so much that I get
[44:47.780 --> 44:49.580]  worried when I start eating them because then I'm like
[44:49.580 --> 44:50.960]  I've had seven
[44:51.600 --> 44:52.560]  deviled egg halves.
[44:54.320 --> 44:55.640]  Because how many times
[44:55.640 --> 44:57.200]  are you gonna... oh, of course.
[44:57.420 --> 44:59.280]  How many times are you gonna go and eat
[44:59.280 --> 45:01.520]  five hard-boiled eggs in a sitting?
[45:01.760 --> 45:03.300]  But if they're deviled...
[45:03.300 --> 45:05.680]  It depends. Am I
[45:05.680 --> 45:06.740]  Paul Newman in prison?
[45:08.700 --> 45:09.800]  Do you wanna be?
[45:09.800 --> 45:11.640]  If you would've opened this door
[45:12.820 --> 45:13.500]  would they
[45:14.160 --> 45:15.640]  have fought all these guys?
[45:16.280 --> 45:16.580]  Maybe.
[45:17.800 --> 45:19.640]  Albert's up to something. Dude, there's a
[45:19.640 --> 45:21.240]  dog in here somewhere. You gotta be careful.
[45:21.420 --> 45:22.500]  Yeah, you hear that?
[45:22.500 --> 45:23.800]  Do you know I'm here?
[45:23.860 --> 45:26.640]  Oh, it does know I'm here. Did the door close?
[45:26.780 --> 45:27.600]  It did close.
[45:28.900 --> 45:30.460]  Why would you leave the
[45:30.460 --> 45:32.160]  door open? God damn it!
[45:32.280 --> 45:34.720]  Who closed the door?
[45:35.200 --> 45:36.320]  It looked like you
[45:36.320 --> 45:38.120]  just laid down and died.
[45:38.700 --> 45:39.220]  I did.
[45:40.900 --> 45:42.400]  So again, if you would've opened
[45:42.400 --> 45:44.060]  this door and then alerted
[45:44.060 --> 45:46.360]  the bad guys, then they would've
[45:46.360 --> 45:47.920]  fought. That's crazy. Theoretically.
[45:48.380 --> 45:50.420]  Theoretically, yeah. What game has the best
[45:50.420 --> 45:51.980]  fighting between factions?
[45:53.500 --> 45:54.540]  This one does
[45:54.540 --> 45:55.080]  later.
[45:58.320 --> 45:58.900]  Starcraft.
[45:59.140 --> 46:00.060]  Games where you can just watch
[46:00.060 --> 46:02.420]  your enemies. What's that
[46:02.420 --> 46:04.380]  game? It's a PC
[46:04.380 --> 46:05.520]  game. I've played it with
[46:06.190 --> 46:07.660]  Burndog and Antonio
[46:07.660 --> 46:09.860]  quite a bit. It's like a
[46:10.370 --> 46:11.640]  generation zero.
[46:12.800 --> 46:14.420]  There's like warring
[46:14.420 --> 46:15.600]  factions in that game.
[46:18.650 --> 46:19.770]  Where are you, Clicker?
[46:20.210 --> 46:21.550]  It's like a first person shooter.
[46:21.690 --> 46:23.710]  It's like post-apocalyptic. You're a bunch of
[46:23.710 --> 46:25.710]  Swedish kids that come
[46:25.710 --> 46:27.510]  home from a field trip and all the grown-ups are gone.
[46:28.190 --> 46:29.790]  And everybody's gone and you're trying to
[46:29.790 --> 46:31.750]  solve the mystery of what happened and there's
[46:31.750 --> 46:33.390]  weird robots that are trying to kill you everywhere.
[46:33.730 --> 46:35.950]  It's interesting. It's been out for years.
[46:36.190 --> 46:36.630]  It's a good game though.
[46:37.150 --> 46:39.790]  I was thinking the same
[46:39.790 --> 46:40.850]  thing. Gross.
[46:41.910 --> 46:43.030]  Geoff, you need to control your dog.
[46:43.630 --> 46:45.410]  I can't. He's on another floor of the house.
[46:46.410 --> 46:47.510]  He's freaking me out, man.
[46:47.510 --> 46:49.670]  He's freaking me out. All I hear is bark, bark, bark.
[46:49.790 --> 46:51.630]  He keeps alerting the Licker. Here, I'll tell you what.
[46:51.690 --> 46:52.570]  I'll go shut my door. I'll be right back.
[46:52.690 --> 46:53.190]  The Licker.
[46:55.390 --> 46:57.610]  I've just been playing a lot of different games, guys.
[46:58.350 --> 47:01.450]  Alright, let's see what's in here. This Licker's clicking
[47:01.450 --> 47:03.130]  and this Clicker's licking, man. I don't know.
[47:03.630 --> 47:04.270]  Oh, God.
[47:05.130 --> 47:07.470]  It's all universal. He's doing
[47:07.470 --> 47:09.110]  dog shit. There was a mailman.
[47:09.370 --> 47:11.490]  What do you want him to do? Oh, that kind of
[47:11.490 --> 47:12.910]  dog shit. Oh, that kind of dog shit.
[47:12.910 --> 47:13.470]  It's his job.
[47:14.750 --> 47:15.510]  He's deucing
[47:15.510 --> 47:17.530]  on the fucking guy. Oh, I remember this.
[47:17.730 --> 47:18.130]  Ooh.
[47:19.730 --> 47:21.170]  Hey, look. Groth.
[47:24.490 --> 47:25.770]  Or full spectrum warrior, I guess.
[47:25.810 --> 47:27.710]  We had Nick so convinced we'd fucking complete it.
[47:27.830 --> 47:29.470]  It was pretty good. You did!
[47:30.490 --> 47:31.530]  Until nobody responded
[47:31.530 --> 47:33.630]  to me when I was like, really? Yeah, of course.
[47:36.030 --> 47:37.830]  What happened to all that full spectrum
[47:37.830 --> 47:38.170]  shit?
[47:39.510 --> 47:41.710]  Did it never... it must have come out. It hasn't come out yet.
[47:41.710 --> 47:42.370]  Really?
[47:42.570 --> 47:44.810]  We got to sit on stuff for a year.
[47:46.590 --> 47:47.550]  We have...
[47:47.550 --> 47:48.990]  I wonder how many
[47:49.610 --> 47:51.070]  pieces of content we have
[47:51.070 --> 47:53.630]  that predate the creation of the company.
[47:53.990 --> 47:55.150]  We got to start going.
[47:55.150 --> 47:57.290]  We have one that we're not going to release, I know.
[47:59.250 --> 48:01.210]  It was voted for this week.
[48:02.450 --> 48:03.070]  What's that?
[48:03.550 --> 48:05.010]  On Patreon? Yeah.
[48:05.170 --> 48:07.090]  It was one of the things to be voted on.
[48:07.650 --> 48:08.230]  It did not win.
[48:08.230 --> 48:09.190]  What won?
[48:11.870 --> 48:12.970]  The Tuned Up thing.
[48:13.850 --> 48:15.990]  Oh, cool! That's the first episode of that, too.
[48:16.210 --> 48:16.570]  That's fun.
[48:17.850 --> 48:20.090]  The second episode is getting a totally different vibe
[48:20.090 --> 48:20.570]  from the first.
[48:20.990 --> 48:24.090]  The second episode of Tuned Up is really good.
[48:25.770 --> 48:27.470]  Geoff got kind of mad in the first one.
[48:27.530 --> 48:28.250]  I was in a bad mood.
[48:29.310 --> 48:30.550]  He was a little mad.
[48:32.050 --> 48:33.650]  I was not having it.
[48:35.030 --> 48:36.330]  The second one was totally different.
[48:36.870 --> 48:38.330]  I'll tell you that I...
[48:38.990 --> 48:40.130]  trimmed a lot of silence.
[48:40.670 --> 48:42.130]  Just a lot of like...
[48:42.810 --> 48:43.250]  stewing.
[48:43.430 --> 48:45.870]  I don't know what you want me to fucking say about ideas!
[48:47.170 --> 48:49.110]  But you got Gavin there for ideas!
[48:49.310 --> 48:50.710]  And then it would be like...
[48:50.710 --> 48:52.030]  No, it's fucking
[48:52.030 --> 48:53.050]  Linkin Park.
[48:53.210 --> 48:56.230]  You said it was a ska band! What are you talking about?
[48:56.850 --> 48:57.430]  Well, you're dead.
[48:59.330 --> 48:59.790]  Thanks, man.
[49:00.370 --> 49:02.530]  And then it's like, well, this isn't a perfect game.
[49:02.630 --> 49:04.970]  It considers Linkin Park ska sometimes.
[49:04.970 --> 49:05.830]  So I don't know.
[49:06.790 --> 49:09.070]  This is a band from 2003.
[49:09.710 --> 49:11.310]  Uh oh. I was listening to them in the 90s.
[49:11.570 --> 49:11.930]  Oh.
[49:12.730 --> 49:13.070]  Whoops.
[49:14.070 --> 49:16.310]  Yeah, the first time we came out in 96, look.
[49:16.630 --> 49:16.770]  Oh.
[49:21.550 --> 49:22.490]  There's a lot of that.
[49:23.310 --> 49:23.490]  Yeah.
[49:24.630 --> 49:27.010]  You wouldn't believe some of the shit that happened in the second one, though.
[49:27.990 --> 49:29.250]  Oh, fucking awesome!
[49:29.630 --> 49:30.370]  Oh, it's so good.
[49:31.070 --> 49:32.710]  I'm so excited for it to come out.
[49:32.710 --> 49:33.830]  Wow, that was a lot of fun.
[49:34.010 --> 49:34.790]  It's a blast.
[49:35.530 --> 49:37.790]  Andrew's been coming up with a lot of good shit.
[49:38.110 --> 49:40.290]  I want to do a video,
[49:40.430 --> 49:41.630]  old Achievement Hunter style.
[49:41.690 --> 49:44.470]  This goes in the pile of videos we are absolutely not going to make,
[49:44.550 --> 49:46.510]  but Gavin and I keep throwing out as ideas.
[49:46.870 --> 49:47.070]  Okay.
[49:48.090 --> 49:50.650]  Of just, like, best couches in video games.
[49:50.870 --> 49:52.530]  Because I feel like I've seen that couch
[49:52.530 --> 49:54.570]  a thousand times, the one you just walked by.
[49:54.610 --> 49:55.730]  It looks cozy, right?
[49:55.890 --> 49:56.910]  That tufted leather couch.
[49:57.330 --> 49:58.330]  We've done toilets before.
[49:58.330 --> 50:00.650]  I also wanted to make a video where I kill a hunter
[50:00.650 --> 50:02.350]  in all the games I can think of.
[50:03.530 --> 50:03.890]  Oh.
[50:05.930 --> 50:07.130]  What do you think is the hardest one?
[50:07.450 --> 50:07.470]  Banshee.
[50:08.030 --> 50:09.510]  You can do that with a Banshee as well.
[50:09.810 --> 50:11.030]  There's about 20 different Banshees.
[50:11.130 --> 50:12.610]  What was the one that we talked about today?
[50:13.850 --> 50:14.630]  That was a Gavin idea.
[50:15.810 --> 50:16.370]  Which one?
[50:17.170 --> 50:19.330]  You presented an idea today. I don't remember what it was.
[50:19.410 --> 50:21.430]  Oh! It was all
[50:21.430 --> 50:23.170]  best of headquarters.
[50:23.990 --> 50:24.350]  Yeah!
[50:24.970 --> 50:26.110]  Visit every map
[50:26.110 --> 50:26.870]  called headquarters.
[50:28.210 --> 50:30.050]  How are you going to do this?
[50:30.930 --> 50:31.470]  You're...
[50:32.450 --> 50:34.430]  Oh, he lived.
[50:35.150 --> 50:36.350]  Dina, do the job!
[50:37.890 --> 50:38.430]  Dive!
[50:38.690 --> 50:39.090]  Dina, please!
[50:39.610 --> 50:41.170]  Oh, man.
[50:41.570 --> 50:43.510]  It required a two-person setup!
[50:43.670 --> 50:45.750]  That could have worked, and to be fair,
[50:45.870 --> 50:47.530]  you did take out one of the enemies.
[50:47.670 --> 50:49.470]  It was the least your partner could do.
[50:50.290 --> 50:51.790]  I can't believe...
[50:51.790 --> 50:52.930]  I'm on your side with that one.
[50:53.230 --> 50:54.850]  Hey, there's the couch.
[50:55.670 --> 50:57.550]  What are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
[50:58.550 --> 50:59.510]  Oh, good question.
[50:59.750 --> 51:00.250]  I don't know yet.
[51:01.510 --> 51:03.730]  I've been eating too many burgers lately.
[51:04.250 --> 51:05.130]  Too many?
[51:05.170 --> 51:06.110]  I don't know what that means.
[51:06.410 --> 51:08.070]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[51:10.330 --> 51:12.030]  We went to Pull Burger yesterday.
[51:12.870 --> 51:13.930]  I'm feeling a little
[51:13.930 --> 51:15.530]  slow and sluggish on the court.
[51:15.870 --> 51:16.290]  Damn.
[51:17.390 --> 51:19.350]  That could be another one. Worst basketball courts
[51:19.350 --> 51:20.730]  in fucking video games.
[51:21.110 --> 51:23.370]  Oh, Resident Evil 2 is definitely
[51:23.370 --> 51:23.950]  on that list.
[51:25.730 --> 51:27.230]  That zombie's just chilling out in there.
[51:28.290 --> 51:29.410]  We're going to try that again.
[51:29.530 --> 51:30.510]  I don't know. What are you thinking for dinner?
[51:32.330 --> 51:32.970]  What do I have?
[51:33.070 --> 51:34.610]  I had Mexican last night.
[51:36.490 --> 51:37.330]  You know,
[51:37.370 --> 51:39.290]  I have tortellini. I'll just make pasta.
[51:39.650 --> 51:40.050]  That's nice.
[51:41.170 --> 51:41.790]  What's in them?
[51:42.590 --> 51:45.070]  Just like a three-cheese tortellini, I think.
[51:45.910 --> 51:46.630]  Like a buatoni.
[51:46.630 --> 51:48.210]  But it's Costco brand.
[51:49.050 --> 51:50.570]  Oh, do they make good shit?
[51:50.650 --> 51:52.170]  Yeah, they do make good shit.
[51:52.310 --> 51:54.610]  What sauce
[51:54.610 --> 51:56.610]  are you going with? Oh, Rayo's.
[51:58.170 --> 51:58.610]  That's
[51:58.610 --> 52:00.430]  the hotness right now, dude. Everyone's on that.
[52:00.590 --> 52:01.170]  It's good stuff.
[52:03.190 --> 52:04.390]  Way to go, buddy.
[52:04.630 --> 52:06.510]  Quick on the draw. That fence post
[52:06.510 --> 52:07.370]  lost the quick draw.
[52:07.630 --> 52:10.370]  I don't know that I've ever seen hip fire
[52:10.370 --> 52:12.650]  that's down a barrel, but that's pretty cool.
[52:14.030 --> 52:14.470]  Alright.
[52:18.910 --> 52:20.230]  Why are you laughing?
[52:21.190 --> 52:22.870]  I was just thinking about
[52:22.870 --> 52:24.350]  cutting a compilation
[52:24.350 --> 52:25.150]  from these streams.
[52:30.430 --> 52:32.050]  Oh, I need
[52:32.050 --> 52:33.710]  to get notes back for the thing
[52:33.710 --> 52:34.510]  that Phoenix sent.
[52:36.690 --> 52:37.250]  Oh.
[52:37.970 --> 52:39.550]  He sent version
[52:39.550 --> 52:40.590]  two with Gavin notes.
[52:41.610 --> 52:43.110]  Did you post version two?
[52:43.290 --> 52:45.310]  I might not have. I was looking at
[52:45.950 --> 52:46.950]  That would be
[52:46.950 --> 52:48.570]  step one in the process.
[52:48.830 --> 52:51.150]  Shut up. I was thinking
[52:51.150 --> 52:52.570]  out loud about what needs to happen.
[52:53.230 --> 52:55.390]  And it was also a subtle way
[52:55.390 --> 52:57.390]  to tease that there's a new Phoenix edits
[52:57.390 --> 52:59.090]  video coming out, but without
[52:59.090 --> 53:01.350]  drawing too much attention to it, but letting the
[53:01.350 --> 53:03.330]  audience feel it a bit.
[53:03.970 --> 53:05.050]  Might be part of it.
[53:05.390 --> 53:06.610]  Don't look. Don't look.
[53:06.710 --> 53:07.630]  Don't miss the headshot.
[53:09.290 --> 53:12.150]  You can just take him out.
[53:12.290 --> 53:13.350]  Go get him.
[53:13.350 --> 53:13.850]  Go get him.
[53:14.330 --> 53:16.370]  Get him!
[53:18.070 --> 53:19.010]  Oh, Nick.
[53:19.390 --> 53:20.050]  You blew it.
[53:21.950 --> 53:23.330]  Sometimes Dina will
[53:23.330 --> 53:24.410]  go and retrieve him.
[53:24.630 --> 53:25.810]  This could work.
[53:26.890 --> 53:27.370]  Easy.
[53:29.490 --> 53:30.590]  You killed Alex?
[53:34.140 --> 53:35.020]  Nick, you ready?
[53:35.960 --> 53:36.480]  This is it.
[53:36.680 --> 53:37.240]  Bury it.
[53:38.180 --> 53:39.800]  I buried the hatchet.
[53:41.580 --> 53:42.780]  Fucking brutal.
[53:42.780 --> 53:43.740]  That was it.
[53:43.760 --> 53:45.380]  You better be careful.
[53:45.780 --> 53:47.260]  I don't think it's just them.
[53:48.940 --> 53:50.360]  Is that an autosave?
[53:51.360 --> 53:51.660]  Alright.
[53:52.820 --> 53:54.280]  I'm quicksave happy now.
[53:55.300 --> 53:55.740]  Oh, good.
[53:56.720 --> 53:58.380]  I cannot believe it was
[53:58.380 --> 54:00.780]  only two guys in this area. That's nuts.
[54:01.120 --> 54:02.520]  Well, there's zombies down here. Let's go get them.
[54:02.720 --> 54:03.080]  Are there?
[54:04.280 --> 54:05.920]  We gotta collect some shit.
[54:05.920 --> 54:06.560]  Oh, okay.
[54:10.240 --> 54:12.160]  Oh, boy. It's getting loud in here.
[54:13.180 --> 54:13.420]  Dina!
[54:13.640 --> 54:15.520]  Collect a bunch of stuff so you can use it
[54:15.520 --> 54:16.340]  getting out of here alive.
[54:17.060 --> 54:19.480]  Oh, so you have played this game.
[54:21.340 --> 54:22.440]  Yes, welcome to
[54:22.440 --> 54:23.980]  attempt number 400
[54:23.980 --> 54:25.760]  and whatever for whatever item.
[54:25.860 --> 54:26.160]  Go get it!
[54:26.280 --> 54:30.060]  Oh my god. How did that not come after you?
[54:30.140 --> 54:30.720]  That's crazy.
[54:31.540 --> 54:32.560]  He was so silent.
[54:32.560 --> 54:33.240]  Yeah.
[54:33.820 --> 54:34.960]  He's an assassin.
[54:36.840 --> 54:38.800]  He's getting better. He's learning.
[54:39.480 --> 54:39.940]  I'm learning.
[54:40.380 --> 54:41.080]  He's like a robot.
[54:42.840 --> 54:44.460]  Nick is AI.
[54:45.480 --> 54:46.360]  He's like Skynet.
[54:46.780 --> 54:48.800]  He's definitely artificial intelligence.
[54:50.920 --> 54:52.480]  Eric, what if you got paid
[54:52.480 --> 54:53.540]  $450
[54:54.360 --> 54:55.000]  but
[54:56.160 --> 54:58.360]  whenever you played this game, all the enemies
[54:58.360 --> 55:00.100]  were replaced with MILFs?
[55:02.160 --> 55:02.680]  What?
[55:04.340 --> 55:05.900]  Is there a mod for that?
[55:05.980 --> 55:06.760]  I'll do it for free.
[55:08.260 --> 55:09.960]  We would switch this stream
[55:09.960 --> 55:10.960]  right now.
[55:11.740 --> 55:13.180]  That would be...
[55:14.100 --> 55:14.800]  Hang on.
[55:15.560 --> 55:16.920]  I'm gonna go ahead and Google
[55:16.920 --> 55:20.340]  Last of Us Mod MILFs.
[55:20.380 --> 55:22.060]  Was that presented in the chat
[55:22.060 --> 55:23.160]  or was that off your head?
[55:23.540 --> 55:26.220]  I was just thinking up a scenario.
[55:27.280 --> 55:28.280]  Is Eric's thing
[55:28.280 --> 55:28.980]  MILFs?
[55:29.040 --> 55:32.100]  I was trying to think of a change
[55:32.100 --> 55:34.240]  that wouldn't change the gameplay but would completely ruin
[55:34.240 --> 55:35.060]  the vibe of the story.
[55:35.400 --> 55:37.300]  I think he found it.
[55:37.760 --> 55:40.240]  It might mildly change the
[55:40.240 --> 55:41.780]  gameplay when there's a
[55:41.780 --> 55:44.200]  MILF sadly crying in the
[55:44.200 --> 55:45.940]  corner of these run-down
[55:45.940 --> 55:46.520]  buildings.
[55:47.560 --> 55:49.580]  Hit him with an axe.
[55:50.100 --> 55:52.100]  Clark said that was a Gloryhole
[55:52.100 --> 55:52.840]  Gavin thought.
[55:54.620 --> 55:56.180]  I did search for
[55:56.180 --> 55:58.020]  Last of Us 2 MILFs mod
[55:58.020 --> 55:59.660]  and I didn't really find anything.
[56:00.480 --> 56:00.920]  Wow.
[56:02.300 --> 56:03.860]  Maybe somebody will make it someday.
[56:03.980 --> 56:04.520]  Let's hope not.
[56:05.500 --> 56:07.840]  I just like the idea of Eric being in a bar
[56:07.840 --> 56:09.880]  talking to someone about this game but he can't really
[56:09.880 --> 56:12.100]  have the full conversation because he's only playing
[56:12.100 --> 56:14.080]  the MILF. Isn't it so scary when you
[56:14.080 --> 56:15.880]  jump down on that second building? There's like
[56:15.880 --> 56:18.120]  the one zombie right there and then the clicker
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.240]  and I'm just going like, the one MILF
[56:20.240 --> 56:21.600]  and then the other MILF comes there?
[56:21.920 --> 56:23.860]  There's a MILF that came at me and then the brunette.
[56:23.860 --> 56:25.720]  There's one MILF and if it even
[56:25.720 --> 56:27.280]  hears you it comes at you like crazy
[56:27.280 --> 56:30.180]  and screams and stuff and it's super dangerous.
[56:30.900 --> 56:32.000]  It'll rip you apart.
[56:33.620 --> 56:35.200]  I don't even know.
[56:36.280 --> 56:37.720]  And Ellie lives so long
[56:37.720 --> 56:39.620]  because she's immune
[56:39.620 --> 56:40.760]  to MILFs.
[56:48.140 --> 56:50.140]  It's just, I can't even imagine
[56:50.140 --> 56:51.540]  like, like
[56:51.540 --> 56:51.900]  whatever.
[56:52.680 --> 56:55.800]  Playing this game and going like
[56:55.800 --> 56:57.520]  dude, but what if it was hot
[56:57.520 --> 56:59.920]  and then like, cranking off big style
[56:59.920 --> 57:01.880]  to the last of us two?
[57:02.220 --> 57:02.940]  Oh Christ!
[57:03.440 --> 57:05.680]  Dude, you gotta get around there
[57:05.680 --> 57:06.940]  and open that door so that way
[57:06.940 --> 57:08.700]  they kill this guy, right?
[57:09.080 --> 57:11.160]  Won't the thing come over this way?
[57:11.760 --> 57:12.820]  What? What?
[57:14.820 --> 57:15.340]  Yeah!
[57:15.660 --> 57:16.820]  Yes! There you go!
[57:17.800 --> 57:19.240]  Double MILF takedown!
[57:19.240 --> 57:19.860]  Okay.
[57:20.700 --> 57:23.240]  Alright, this is...
[57:24.420 --> 57:24.760]  Oh!
[57:25.320 --> 57:27.040]  Big Ripper wants to know how I feel about
[57:27.040 --> 57:28.420]  the Sacramento Kings this year.
[57:28.580 --> 57:30.840]  I think that they missed their window and that
[57:30.840 --> 57:32.660]  the West is too stacked and
[57:33.920 --> 57:35.200]  DeRozan's another year older.
[57:37.300 --> 57:37.700]  Well...
[57:37.700 --> 57:39.040]  DeRozan just can't get it done, man.
[57:39.420 --> 57:40.380]  I feel bad for the guy.
[57:41.380 --> 57:43.240]  He's got a better shot of doing it with
[57:43.240 --> 57:45.040]  the Kings than he did with the Bulls, but
[57:45.040 --> 57:46.240]  I just, I don't know, man.
[57:47.840 --> 57:48.240]  Ooh!
[57:48.700 --> 57:49.800]  I like this.
[57:50.300 --> 57:52.280]  I think it's a lot of fun to watch. Jaren Fox is awesome.
[57:53.380 --> 57:54.660]  Oh, oh! They're killing it!
[57:57.140 --> 57:57.940]  Oh, awesome!
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.000]  Aw, damn! Get back up!
[58:00.260 --> 58:01.620]  Get back up! I think it's done.
[58:02.540 --> 58:04.680]  Speaking of done, did you see Kawhi Leonard today?
[58:04.680 --> 58:06.200]  Oh, come on! No, what happened?
[58:06.620 --> 58:08.360]  I'm still looking at
[58:08.360 --> 58:09.360]  Last of Us MILF mods.
[58:09.700 --> 58:12.060]  They announced that Kawhi Leonard is gonna be out
[58:12.060 --> 58:14.100]  indefinitely as they manage an
[58:14.100 --> 58:15.240]  acclaimed knee.
[58:15.800 --> 58:17.620]  No! Oh, Nick!
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.900]  Oh, this really puts you back. I have an idea.
[58:20.780 --> 58:22.040]  Why don't you just unleash
[58:22.040 --> 58:23.740]  the MILF nest on them from the get-go?
[58:24.100 --> 58:25.820]  Yes, let's go! Follow me, MILFs!
[58:26.000 --> 58:26.200]  Unleash!
[58:29.300 --> 58:30.340]  Come on, MILFs!
[58:30.640 --> 58:32.080]  It's MILF Central up in this bitch!
[58:32.940 --> 58:34.120]  You better hit the deck!
[58:35.180 --> 58:35.680]  Oh, there's ammo.
[58:36.060 --> 58:36.580]  Oh, God!
[58:37.480 --> 58:39.860]  Oh! Hello!
[58:40.620 --> 58:40.860]  Oh!
[58:42.760 --> 58:43.820]  What are you?
[58:44.420 --> 58:45.060]  How are you?
[58:45.480 --> 58:48.320]  And no one else. That's Dina. That was Dina.
[58:48.740 --> 58:49.180]  Oh!
[58:52.280 --> 58:54.880]  Man, you're caught between a MILF and a hard place.
[58:55.720 --> 58:56.160]  Oh!
[58:56.660 --> 58:58.300]  Just where a MILF would like it.
[58:58.380 --> 58:59.840]  Get in the grass where you're safe.
[59:00.700 --> 59:02.140]  Uh, yeah.
[59:02.260 --> 59:03.760]  Yeah, get in that grass. Oh, wait!
[59:04.140 --> 59:05.580]  Yeah, go under.
[59:05.860 --> 59:07.300]  You can't.
[59:07.300 --> 59:09.220]  Oh, Dina, I hope you're alright.
[59:09.520 --> 59:10.520]  You might be fine there.
[59:10.740 --> 59:12.460]  No, they're gonna run into you.
[59:13.040 --> 59:14.700]  Nah, they'll get shot.
[59:19.080 --> 59:20.740]  You're so messed up!
[59:20.820 --> 59:22.540]  This is so much worse somehow.
[59:25.300 --> 59:27.340]  Dude, guide W2 in the chat.
[59:27.480 --> 59:29.580]  MILF modified, infected, living free.
[59:37.300 --> 59:37.580]  Ah!
[59:39.700 --> 59:41.500]  Oh, Dina, don't kill them both.
[59:41.640 --> 59:44.320]  Guide W2, that's the fucking joke of the day, buddy.
[59:46.340 --> 59:47.560]  That was working, though.
[59:49.200 --> 59:51.480]  We'll run out the other door this time.
[59:51.500 --> 59:53.180]  Yeah, I think you just have to lead...
[59:53.180 --> 59:55.300]  You have to lead the MILFs over to...
[59:56.160 --> 59:57.080]  Let's go, ladies!
[59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.300]  Hey, ladies!
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.600]  Hey, ladies!
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.520]  Up we go!
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.040]  It's them!
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:06.720]  Dude, shut up!
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.580]  It's them!
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.720]  Well, that could have gone better.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.660]  Alright, let's try it again.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.620]  Bro got MILFed.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.640]  There you go!
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.700]  I feel like after this, Nick's new nickname should be MILF Killer.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.780]  Is that right?
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.260]  Well, I think it changes the dynamic of MILF Hunter a bit.
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:34.980]  MILF Killer.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.800]  Oh, man.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.940]  Introducing him on the podcast now.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.620]  I don't think you should do that.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.660]  This is my wife being like,
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.340]  What the fuck are you doing at work?
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.200]  Yeah, so what's this?
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.840]  You need to dive into the deck, dude.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.960]  I like that you keep using that door.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.860]  Yeah, he loves it. He loves that door.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.020]  There you go!
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.240]  I don't think you were right!
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.000]  Hit the deck! You were right! Hit the deck!
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.480]  I told you!
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.640]  You just had to lead them.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:09.720]  Yeah.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.400]  I had to lead the MILFs to freedom.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.560]  Alright, now we just watch.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.480]  Oh, it sounds brutal.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.180]  501, baby!
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.540]  501, it's brutal.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.800]  Wow, it's getting crazy in there.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.060]  See, this is the right way to do it, though.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:30.640]  This is great.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.880]  They're having a real MILF party over there.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:33.640]  Yeah!
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.000]  I did not start this, by the way.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.000]  This was Gavin.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.980]  Yeah, that is all Gavin.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.660]  Let's all remember Gavin did this.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.340]  Okay, I think they have outlasted the infected.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.200]  Outlasted a different game.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.480]  Alright.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.720]  It's true, we played it already.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.800]  That video keeps getting pushed for other videos.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:52.580]  It's true!
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.960]  It's not going to come out until next Halloween.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.660]  Yep, next Thanksgiving.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.660]  I'd be okay with that.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.120]  You know what?
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.800]  Oh, wow, you're really going to go for it.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.040]  I regret it instantly.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.060]  That was a glance.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.240]  Well, you know,
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.500]  unless they can create some antibiotics,
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.320]  which, as we've heard, is difficult.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.960]  They'll probably die eventually.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.580]  There's bullets.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.000]  There should be a mod just to rub dirt on all the bullets.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.080]  It fucks up your gun faster,
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.540]  but it makes everyone sick.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.400]  Just carry your bullets in a bag of moldy bread.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:29.920]  Yep.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:32.920]  Ooh.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.320]  How's this going to go?
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.640]  You get that side, I'll get this side.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:37.640]  It's going to be great.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.640]  I can't believe all the MILFs are gone.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.980]  Well, they did their job.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:43.500]  That sounded weird, didn't it?
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.340]  Oh, yeah!
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.220]  One down.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.120]  Careful.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.880]  You can hear them gooping out.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.040]  I think the ladies died in the cafe over there.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.600]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.520]  So, I'm gonna...
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.300]  Let's just, you know, just for shits and giggles,
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.400]  let's just see if this works.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.740]  You can also go grab the fucking ammo from the back of this truck or whatever, isn't it?
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:03.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.460]  I'll bet you it's like an explosive powder.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.320]  There's a guy over there.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.560]  Yeah, there sure is.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.840]  He probably saw you.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:09.860]  Two of them?
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.680]  Oh, there's two guys.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.360]  You have a bottle to toss somewhere, or no?
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.260]  That's twice the guys that we thought it was.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.640]  You got one.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.780]  If you...
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.580]  Like, the way that you start to think about throwing
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.600]  is like so foreign to me, it's like insane.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:23.760]  I'll go that way.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:25.280]  Arcade zero.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.120]  There's a third guy, it turns out.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.380]  Hey Gavin, I just finished a prostate exam.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.640]  Can I get a shout-out? How'd the prostate exam go?
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.940]  Oh yeah, how'd that go?
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.400]  He loved it? What the fuck?
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.800]  He gets them weekly?
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.160]  I'm the healthiest guy in the world.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.020]  Really not that big a deal?
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.600]  Okay, weird.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.800]  Go Dina.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:49.500]  Push the charge.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.280]  You're about to shoot Dina in the kidney, though.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.520]  Oh no.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.500]  You got that one, though.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.480]  Dive! Dive!
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.120]  If you'd have domed him right there, you'd be so okay right now.
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:02.600]  Didn't do that, though.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.600]  Are you reloaded?
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.760]  Dina needs to kill.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.160]  Oh no!
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.000]  Get him!
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.100]  You got him.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.480]  Did Dina throw a brick at him or something?
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.360]  There's a guy in there.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.520]  I think you better hit the deck, dude.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:16.900]  I'm down.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.440]  Calm down.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.800]  There's ammo in the back of the truck.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.620]  Don't embarrass me in front of the MILFs.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.680]  Don't even worry about it, dude.
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.220]  What, the MILFs?
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.100]  No, the ammo.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.200]  Oh, it's not ammo.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.220]  It's like an explosive powder, probably.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.380]  Yeah, with a blowbag.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.980]  It's for your blowpipe.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.360]  Can you craft it?
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.080]  Nope, never mind.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.080]  I looked.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.700]  Well, I'm hurt pretty bad.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.480]  Oh, oh, oh!
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.320]  God, you just kept moving at the same pace.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.240]  There's going to be a couple of them.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.120]  She's hurt pretty bad.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:54.580]  Make a bomb.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.120]  There's a bottle in there.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.300]  Can I get to it? That guy sees me.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.340]  Where's the other dude in reference to this?
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:02.100]  Oh, there he is.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.160]  I don't think I can squeeze through here.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.420]  No, it's going to be too...
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.800]  Have you thought about going back and around?
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:11.160]  Like...
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.160]  Back and to the left?
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.160]  Real Kennedy.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.580]  You do whatever you feel, man.
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.280]  This is going to be it.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.420]  This is going to be the end of the run.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.240]  Yeah, we're going to make it out.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.220]  Unlike those MILFs.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:32.980]  You okay?
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.020]  Who, me?
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.360]  Yeah, I was thinking about when I saw Kennedy's car.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.200]  But the roof was on.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.980]  But I think they take the roof off like one day a year.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.440]  Maybe like on the anniversary or whatever.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:45.940]  I don't know.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.720]  Great. Hey, remember this?
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.040]  They say...
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.920]  Good joke.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.620]  It was supposed to be on that day.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.120]  He insisted they take it off.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:56.880]  I didn't know that.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.960]  They didn't want to take it off.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.900]  Secret Service was not into it.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:02.540]  Wow.
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:03.400]  I wonder why.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:11.580]  Slowly...
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:14.900]  Somebody wants...
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:15.920]  Alright, it's not Chad.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:20.100]  It needs clarification as to why a foot long hot dog doesn't count as two.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.300]  I've lost sleep over this.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.180]  Eric, I think you can sum it up pretty quickly.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.400]  It's one hot dog.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.280]  There's a spirit to this.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.700]  There is a spirit to it.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.540]  What is there not to understand?
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.300]  It's a hot dog.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.220]  Don't get pedantic with hot dogs.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.940]  We're not measuring and metering them out like they're a precious resource.
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.100]  It doesn't matter.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.700]  You eat a little hot dog, you eat a little hot dog.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.080]  You eat a big hot dog, you eat a big hot dog.
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:44.940]  It's a foot long.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.120]  It's like saying, why not call a foot long two sandwiches?
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.960]  It's like eating a 72 ounce porterhouse steak.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.280]  You're not eating nine steaks.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.940]  You're eating one big ass steak.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.860]  Who cares?
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.620]  How many steaks could Nick eat?
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.620]  Did you try to eat one of those big ones, Nick?
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.180]  I ate a quarter of one of those.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.680]  Nick did a really good job eating it or whatever.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:12.400]  He was going gray like E.T. right before he ate it.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.900]  So that might have hindered him.
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.320]  It was not good.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.180]  He was doing bad.
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.760]  I'm going to drop a photo real quick.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:18.980]  Look at this thing.
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:19.960]  Oh, you took a photo of it?
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.120]  I will say that I fucked up.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.020]  I was going to give the steak to the crew to try.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:28.480]  Yeah.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.920]  It was pretty cool.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.020]  It was pretty cool.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.960]  If your steak was like an inch wide and it was a big long strip.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:38.560]  Uh huh.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.720]  And it was just on a conveyor belt.
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.100]  Coming at you.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.080]  How long could you eat it?
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.380]  It would have to be going really slow.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.080]  I don't chew steak very fast.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.220]  What about an inch?
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.980]  What about six inches a minute?
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:57.760]  Wow.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.880]  Are you having to cut it?
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.200]  Am I just chomping?
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.240]  Is it one piece?
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.440]  Do you have to tear it off with your teeth?
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.020]  Uh, yeah.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.980]  I think steak is just the wrong food for this.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.600]  You have to think it has to be something else.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.660]  If it was a hot dog.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.440]  I think hot dog is something that's like...
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:19.840]  Oh, look at that.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.160]  So we could potentially make an 18 foot hot dog.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.600]  And just see who lost the longest.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.220]  Yep.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.920]  That's a good idea though.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:30.240]  Yep.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.460]  Who would win? Nick would win?
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.940]  Yeah, probably.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.340]  When Nick is unleashed, he just goes.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.320]  He's the next level.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:42.380]  I'd also like to call your attention to, without spoiling it for the audience.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:42.740]  Oh, there's a guy right there.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.940]  Because we don't want to spoil it for the audience.
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:47.160]  Because God knows when this content is coming out.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.740]  But we did measure everyone's mouth size.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.860]  And we do know who has the largest mouth.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:52.360]  We do.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.600]  And I would imagine that would factor into
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.560]  how much hot dog they could pack away.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.180]  Like who's dogging the most, yeah.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.920]  Should I edit that for the Gertler launch?
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.680]  Uh, yeah, I guess so.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.860]  Oh my God, Nick.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.340]  Are you serious?
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.540]  Just blowing your spot up, dude.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.320]  What are you thinking?
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:12.920]  I'm not.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.920]  Oh, alright.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.340]  Do you guys see that picture that I put in Discord?
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.260]  Yeah.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.300]  It's pretty cool.
[01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:27.990]  His name is Ted.
[01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:30.170]  Yeah.
[01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:32.110]  Ted's pretty cool.
[01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.730]  Who in the chat
[01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:37.330]  sorted a
[01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:38.190]  regulation shirt?
[01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:41.290]  Uh, I think just Geoff.
[01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:43.490]  If you ordered a regulation shirt
[01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:44.930]  based on an image you saw
[01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.630]  and we delivered a shirt that looks redesigned,
[01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:48.990]  how would you feel?
[01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:51.170]  Because Gavin wants to find out.
[01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.990]  No, no, no I don't.
[01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.910]  And that's a discussion for next podcast.
[01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:01.550]  Absolutely insane.
[01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:02.870]  Just insane.
[01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.730]  Little teaser.
[01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:06.150]  I think I'm gonna order an extra medium.
[01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:08.750]  You can. Extra medium is the size.
[01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.830]  We made sure.
[01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:12.090]  You could ditch that.
[01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:14.050]  Get one while the getting's good.
[01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:16.070]  Nice, good move, Nick.
[01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:18.410]  You better get one before it doesn't go out of stock
[01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:19.710]  because we're not taking it out of stock.
[01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:21.130]  It's gonna stay for a while.
[01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:23.390]  If you...
[01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:25.590]  Dim Sum Daddy said
[01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:28.290]  if you measured the water displacement of your testicles
[01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.950]  you could make
[01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:30.790]  a scrotler.
[01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:33.850]  Oh shit, I can craft a silencer?
[01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.870]  Fuck me sideways.
[01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:37.070]  You could've crafted a silencer a while ago.
[01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:39.250]  No, I just picked up the booklet for it.
[01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:41.190]  Oh, I thought you picked up
[01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:42.550]  the last of the... nevermind.
[01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:45.270]  A cup that's essentially the size of the amount
[01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.050]  of your balls?
[01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:48.830]  Well, no, it would be like how much water
[01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.630]  is removed from the...
[01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:53.190]  How much water overflows the gerpler because your balls
[01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:53.670]  are in there now.
[01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.770]  It has to be as full.
[01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.530]  So we're just seeing who's got the biggest balls?
[01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:00.250]  Uh, yeah.
[01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:02.450]  Or I guess the floatiest balls.
[01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:04.450]  We could just do that on a scale.
[01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:05.110]  Yeah.
[01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:08.390]  We're not doing heaviest balls. You could have some
[01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.770]  bigger but less dense balls.
[01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:12.610]  You could have some big buoyant
[01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:13.110]  balls.
[01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:14.790]  Big buoyant balls.
[01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:18.090]  This is getting real dumb.
[01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.270]  Yeah, it's something, man.
[01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:22.470]  I thought measuring our throats was gonna be
[01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:24.490]  enough. Well, Nick hasn't shot a milf
[01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:25.510]  for about ten minutes.
[01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:26.190]  It's true.
[01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:29.770]  Nick's gone real soft on the milfs.
[01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:31.890]  Alright, let's...
[01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.570]  Come on.
[01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:35.390]  Flaccid response, Nick.
[01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:37.930]  Let us know. We're looking for the milf mods, guys.
[01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:38.550]  We can't find them.
[01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:40.710]  Give us the milf mods.
[01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.310]  I'm glad I finished that sentence.
[01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.630]  Geoff, was it you who was talking about
[01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:49.510]  stuffing your cock down one of the
[01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:50.510]  toilet rolls?
[01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:53.710]  What? No, that was not me.
[01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.690]  That was your friend Bernie Burns.
[01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:58.150]  Ah. That was an RTPodGara
[01:11:58.150 --> 01:11:59.350]  drunk tank discussion
[01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:01.050]  thirty fucking years ago, probably.
[01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:03.570]  Or maybe
[01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.670]  it wasn't on camera, but I do remember the conversation.
[01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:08.690]  It was definitely not me,
[01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:10.930]  nor have I ever had the
[01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:12.470]  inclination to try.
[01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.370]  God, all three of these guys are right here, huh?
[01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:17.490]  I have one bullet. I could kill
[01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.550]  one. You're insane.
[01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:21.250]  You're insane. Like, why even take the shot?
[01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:23.370]  Like, no chance. You just have to
[01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:23.810]  be patient.
[01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.650]  Uh-oh. Not my strong suit.
[01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:27.850]  Yeah, no shit.
[01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:29.650]  Is there stuff on that wall to your right?
[01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:32.630]  Behind you? That wall? No.
[01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:34.510]  There's nothing right there? Maybe the box is
[01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:36.550]  something, but... What does it say on that sign?
[01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:38.110]  Oh, banking hours.
[01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:39.530]  Oh, Christ alive, Gavin!
[01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:42.690]  What's the sign say?
[01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:44.750]  Now it says banking hours.
[01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:53.070]  Where are you, you little...
[01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:54.450]  Man, somebody was saying their favorite
[01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.430]  Bernie moment was him thinking he could fight wild animals.
[01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:58.330]  I was actually thinking about this the other day, because I was
[01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.990]  wrestling with Albert yesterday.
[01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.950]  He's like
[01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:04.770]  58 pounds, and he's
[01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.870]  a fucking bull.
[01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:08.490]  Not since
[01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:08.950]  he was three.
[01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.530]  He's like a fucking
[01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.710]  bull, dude. Like, he's got...
[01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:16.190]  He can get the upper hand when
[01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:18.050]  you're rolling around on the ground with him.
[01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.230]  And I was reading somewhere that an average
[01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.530]  wolf is 150 pounds.
[01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:24.590]  And I no longer think I could fight
[01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:26.370]  a wolf. Oh, there's no way. Not a wolf.
[01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:28.590]  No. I mean, I've seen how hard... I thought I could
[01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:30.390]  probably figure it out, but I don't anymore.
[01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:32.750]  Three Alberts of
[01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.410]  weight, there's no way. With teeth,
[01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:36.650]  there's no fucking way. I've seen how painful
[01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:38.510]  and how much blood I lost when my own
[01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.570]  cat bit me. I can't imagine fighting anything
[01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:40.970]  serious.
[01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:44.510]  Oh, that might have been a good move, Nick.
[01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:45.910]  You gotta make your move across, I think.
[01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.290]  You just gotta be patient.
[01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:51.510]  I'm just...
[01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.230]  All clear!
[01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:54.430]  You am...
[01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.310]  What?
[01:13:57.190 --> 01:13:58.950]  What? MILF fighter.
[01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:00.450]  Yeah, MILF fighter.
[01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:03.510]  These guys are the last standing MILF team.
[01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:05.570]  This is
[01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:07.570]  the last line of defense between
[01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:08.330]  you and MILFs.
[01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:11.590]  They keep the MILFs
[01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.890]  at bay.
[01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:15.630]  I just
[01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:17.170]  don't know why $450
[01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.410]  would be the thing that someone would have to give me to
[01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:19.870]  play that.
[01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.510]  But you could never
[01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:24.850]  play the actual game.
[01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:27.010]  Oh yeah, I don't care. I've already played this game.
[01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:29.050]  Yeah, give me $450
[01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:31.310]  and let me go crazy on MILFs or whatever.
[01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:33.290]  Yeah, it'd have to be a game you've never played.
[01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:35.430]  Alright, can we... Nick, can we get that isolated?
[01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.450]  Give me $450 and let me go crazy on
[01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.350]  MILFs or whatever? We can use that in the future.
[01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:41.070]  Yeah, appreciate it. Thanks.
[01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:42.930]  That was at 5.14pm.
[01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.630]  Why did you just stand up?
[01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.230]  I did not. What do you mean
[01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:49.230]  I did not? When I clapped,
[01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:50.770]  maybe the controller fell and hit the button.
[01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:54.790]  Oh my god.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.660]  I just want
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.660]  to make a move, but they're both overlapping.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.600]  And you've got to use a bottle to draw
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.920]  him out the long way, go after one guy.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:08.740]  Oh, I could smoke bomb
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:10.700]  him. I don't want to waste...
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.520]  Unbomb the bomb.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.380]  Oh, he's doing it.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.640]  Okay. Oh, I'll just have it made
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.180]  for now. Just in case.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.320]  Oh, there you go.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.200]  Oh, you know what? There's
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.160]  a bottle back this way. Let's go get it.
[01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:28.590]  Okay, I'm going to chuck it.
[01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:30.310]  Ah, there it is.
[01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.330]  Alright, perfect. Let's do this.
[01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:34.210]  I had just the plan. Okay, he's got
[01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:35.230]  just the plan, guys.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.020]  No, you're full of shit.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.180]  You didn't see a fucking thing.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.620]  Go to hell. Is this part of your plan?
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.420]  This is the
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.040]  beration part of the plan.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:48.740]  What?
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.040]  Here we go.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.360]  What do you think that's going to do?
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.720]  We have different... our brains
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.680]  do not work this way. That was madness
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.540]  what you just did. What are you talking about?
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.660]  Now the front will be wide
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.760]  open. You threw away a guaranteed kill
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.800]  on someone. That's not a bomb.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.640]  That was a bottle. Yeah, but you could stun them
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.560]  on their face with it and then just stab them.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.500]  I can do a lot better. It's a guaranteed kill
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.100]  from the front.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.120]  Well,
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.000]  that was a mistake, it turns out.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.300]  Is that right?
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.240]  Alright, well run across now and hit the grass
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.000]  and maybe you just keep on slithering.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:25.940]  See, look,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.980]  I got them back on...
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:28.160]  Go!
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.560]  Which way?
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.080]  You could have slithered.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.040]  Every idea that he has is to go
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.220]  straight instead of
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:39.340]  like...
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.640]  Which way can I go here?
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.160]  Look at all of the tall grass
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.320]  on one side or the other. It's not that tall.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.420]  This guy's never streamed a day in his life.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.640]  Uh-oh.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.400]  I'm running away now. You got up in front of him.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:53.320]  You're a lunatic.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.420]  Now you've just fallen apart at the seams,
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.160]  Nick. Why does this happen
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.340]  to you? Because you're talking.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:00.960]  Stop talking.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.880]  Do you think the problem is us talking?
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:04.820]  No.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:06.600]  I think it's me.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.240]  That's good. I know it's you.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.100]  Alright, Nick, you
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.980]  clearly have this. If you can just get across
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.180]  the street. Yeah, if I wasn't
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.460]  bloodied...
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.100]  Alright.
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:20.760]  You're fine.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.780]  He refuses.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.180]  He refuses
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.740]  to sneak. I don't need to.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.320]  It's not...
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.940]  I feel like we've been here before. We have.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.360]  Time is a flat circle.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.340]  You're crazy. He can see you.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:42.300]  No, he can't. He doesn't know I'm here.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.780]  He's looking...
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.740]  He's so...
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.160]  This is just like
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.080]  psycho behavior. Here we go.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.120]  Oh, Nick.
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.380]  That was pretty cool. Don't listen
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.480]  to these haters, Nick.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.020]  You've got this.
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.200]  I'm so excited for people to go back and watch this
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:02.620]  on Tuesday.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.000]  Don't listen to these haters, Nick. You're the true
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.720]  milk master in this party.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.820]  Get down!
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.240]  I am down!
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.440]  Oh, wow.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.720]  Dean is real.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:15.720]  Wow.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.780]  Watch the open door to your
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.720]  side, though, because there's that other guy who's down
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:21.900]  there.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.600]  Oh, you know what? Here. We'll take cover behind
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.800]  the coffee shop.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:28.960]  Oh, a drawer.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:30.300]  Nope.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.720]  Can I go through this window?
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.840]  Do we put this out on Tuesday?
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.140]  Oh, this
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.480]  will be up on Thursday next week.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.920]  I'm used to the Friday stream
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:41.780]  and it goes up on Tuesday.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.780]  The VOD goes up the morning of the
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:46.860]  day of the next stream.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.020]  Give me the gun.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.600]  Nick said Wednesday.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.260]  He's dead. He's fucking dead.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.260]  He's dead as dicks, dude.
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.800]  That's a dick. Dick, dead, dead, dick.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.280]  Dude, she's going for a rifle.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.740]  I just want to grab that gun. Why can't she
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:02.860]  reach across the table to get the gun?
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:03.780]  Short arms.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:04.820]  You're dead.
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.740]  Do a slither.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.560]  Oh, no, you're dead.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.840]  Why would you even try
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:13.200]  for it?
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.920]  It's clearly a trap.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.360]  Who do you think put the gun there?
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.540]  Nick is a rat
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.980]  who's going, oh, whoa, look at this piece of cheese.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:24.880]  Listen, I
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.500]  can get it before the trap snaps back.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.520]  Oh, man.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.400]  That's
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.340]  how you fucking
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.320]  do it.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.480]  You see
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.520]  how you just take your
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.580]  time. You make that move. You don't
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:44.560]  rush it. You find your spot. Now you
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.320]  can go get that bullet. No problem.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.880]  There's a guy upstairs.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.360]  I think Dina may have killed him
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.880]  because she just
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.940]  had an interaction where they're talking.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.120]  So this may be
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.260]  where... I just did.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.020]  Wow, you might have just
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.760]  done it. I did it.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.840]  Unbelievable. Whoever said they were going to get
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.000]  five subs 15 minutes ago?
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.040]  And you're thinking, oh, that guy said
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.820]  on that other run. Somebody said
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:10.900]  more recently, five subs if he does
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.260]  it on this run. It's still that run.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.580]  I'm just letting you know.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.000]  Don't feel obligated. Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.360]  But there's DePaulo. Look at that.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.880]  Five subs!
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:22.700]  DePaulo coming through.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:23.840]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.580]  DePaulo 12.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.300]  Getting shamed into five gifted subs.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.200]  Thank you for your
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.800]  arm-twisted generosity.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.200]  Man of my word. Yeah, I hear that, bro.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:35.780]  Nick demanded
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.300]  10. He said no.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.960]  You know what? I'm negotiating.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.240]  I'm negotiating.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:43.940]  Nick, you don't get to know what goes
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.860]  on up those stairs. That's another
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.180]  adventure that we're not privy to.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.940]  It's fucking cool, though. Well, that's a good spot
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.140]  to end it, don't you think?
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.240]  I thought, yeah, I think that's a great spot to end it.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:53.860]  Way to go, Nick.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.120]  You did a whole bunch there.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.400]  You did a great job.
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.560]  DePaulo's a man of his word.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.580]  Nick, you've done it all.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.760]  You've said it all.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.800]  Cory7 says, I'll give seven subs. For what, though?
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.900]  You can just give seven subs.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.860]  No, go ahead.
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:11.840]  Just give seven subs.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.880]  Go ahead. Thank you.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.980]  And next time Nick plays this as the
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:18.500]  MILF Master, we'll have the MILF mod
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.180]  installed in this game.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.940]  Thank you guys so much for watching.

[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.840]  regulationstore.com regulationstore.store

[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.560]  you need. You can watch this on
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.740]  Thursday of next week and then come back
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.660]  at 4pm on that Thursday
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.780]  and watch Nick continue playing this game.
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.620]  Thank you guys so much
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.480]  for watching. We'll be back tomorrow with
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.440]  another stream, but
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.160]  for now, goodbye.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.740]  Bye for now!
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.260]  I clicked the Geoff.Sucks link
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:52.720]  in the chat.
