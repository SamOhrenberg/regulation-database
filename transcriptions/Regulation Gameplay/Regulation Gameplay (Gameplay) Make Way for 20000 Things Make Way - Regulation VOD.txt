[00:00.000 --> 00:01.580]  Why does Gavin say Xbox?
[00:02.020 --> 00:03.180]  I don't know. Are you on Xbox?
[00:04.360 --> 00:05.480]  He's playing on console.
[00:06.480 --> 00:08.800]  What? That's what that symbol means.
[00:09.700 --> 00:10.200]  Are you on shit?
[00:12.120 --> 00:14.620]  Why? Why did you say uh?
[00:15.160 --> 00:16.960]  We asked if you were playing on Xbox.
[00:17.700 --> 00:19.540]  Are you playing? Are you playing on Xbox?
[00:20.140 --> 00:22.840]  I guess so, because I don't have it on PC and I do have on Xbox.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.800]  Then that would explain as to why you're playing on Xbox.
[00:26.060 --> 00:27.260]  Is your Xbox on?
[00:28.920 --> 00:30.940]  Yeah, okay, that's just so funny.
[00:30.960 --> 00:32.680]  I didn't even know the game was on Xbox.
[00:32.840 --> 00:34.720]  We've been playing it on PC this whole time.
[00:34.740 --> 00:35.580]  I thought it was just PC.
[00:35.980 --> 00:38.180]  Really? I flipped it.
[00:38.240 --> 00:40.160]  Usually I'm on PC by accident and you're on Xbox.
[00:40.360 --> 00:41.980]  We've been on PC this entire time.
[00:42.060 --> 00:45.540]  I had the whole weird thing where like my screen would shrink
[00:45.540 --> 00:47.140]  if I touch the mouse wrong or something.
[00:47.460 --> 00:50.520]  And my controller mapping was weird.
[00:50.760 --> 00:51.920]  I was having trouble with Steam.
[00:52.480 --> 00:54.500]  You know what doesn't happen? On an Xbox.
[00:54.500 --> 00:57.920]  Well, it certainly doesn't, but it does happen here.
[00:57.980 --> 01:00.480]  Welcome to Make Way, but we are making way in a special way.
[01:00.900 --> 01:03.040]  We're making way for 20,000 things.
[01:03.200 --> 01:08.920]  As myself, Geoff, Nick and Gavin are playing Make Way for you today.
[01:09.480 --> 01:12.520]  Andrew has begun listing some more 20,000 things.
[01:12.680 --> 01:15.020]  Andrew, do you want to read off what you've listed so far?
[01:15.300 --> 01:17.420]  Live, dumb, fool, idiot, clueless.
[01:17.500 --> 01:23.060]  I'm just tapping into the ether, tapping into the world and seeing what comes.
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.240]  Hey, and that's the way it's going to go.
[01:25.420 --> 01:27.480]  I respect it. And I think it's time to get started.
[01:27.640 --> 01:29.360]  Let's play some Make Way.
[01:29.880 --> 01:31.500]  How is clueless a thing?
[01:32.760 --> 01:33.320]  What do you mean?
[01:33.940 --> 01:35.280]  It's a thing. It was a movie.
[01:35.540 --> 01:36.940]  It was a movie. That's yeah.
[01:37.060 --> 01:38.940]  Oh, it could be two things. Clueless and clueless.
[01:39.760 --> 01:41.660]  Huh. OK, well, I hit ready.
[01:41.760 --> 01:45.400]  So if we want to play the game, this is the second time this week
[01:45.400 --> 01:46.780]  Gavin's been against using the PC.
[01:46.960 --> 01:48.600]  Oh, whine, complaint.
[01:51.760 --> 01:52.420]  Oh, man.
[01:52.520 --> 01:54.360]  I got some new cars, too.
[01:54.460 --> 01:56.220]  I got to do. Check this thing out.
[01:57.240 --> 01:58.660]  I want to be piss Lambo again.
[01:58.700 --> 01:59.720]  Oh, my God. Look at that thing.
[01:59.980 --> 02:02.060]  Yeah. Yeah, I got some crazy stuff.
[02:02.880 --> 02:04.120]  It's even playlists.
[02:04.820 --> 02:05.940]  What's an instigate?
[02:08.580 --> 02:10.300]  I think it's what you're doing.
[02:10.520 --> 02:11.860]  It's a work you're doing.
[02:12.120 --> 02:13.700]  Yeah, but you can't have one.
[02:13.820 --> 02:14.600]  What do you mean?
[02:15.080 --> 02:16.160]  You can have an instigation.
[02:16.280 --> 02:17.320]  You can have one in a dictionary.
[02:18.300 --> 02:19.500]  Instigation would be a thing.
[02:20.020 --> 02:21.140]  Instigate is a word in a dictionary.
[02:21.800 --> 02:22.900]  Oh, come on.
[02:23.160 --> 02:25.500]  But the thing in the dictionary, stickler.
[02:26.260 --> 02:27.300]  That's a thing.
[02:30.100 --> 02:30.840]  Oh, man.
[02:31.380 --> 02:31.860]  Oh, shit.
[02:32.160 --> 02:32.740]  Oh, boy.
[02:32.820 --> 02:34.160]  Got to remember how to play this game.
[02:34.780 --> 02:36.440]  Oh, no. Oh, shit.
[02:36.920 --> 02:38.040]  Come on. Just joined us.
[02:38.120 --> 02:38.760]  We're racing.
[02:38.900 --> 02:40.700]  Except Andrew, who's writing things down.
[02:40.840 --> 02:41.620]  Some of them are things.
[02:42.520 --> 02:43.600]  What is the thing?
[02:44.040 --> 02:44.660]  What do you mean?
[02:45.600 --> 02:47.360]  How are these not all things?
[02:47.780 --> 02:48.320]  Rats win.
[02:49.040 --> 02:50.200]  You can write down rats.
[02:50.260 --> 02:51.400]  You can write down rats win.
[02:51.680 --> 02:53.320]  You got like, there's like a lot you can do here.
[02:53.740 --> 02:55.300]  I'll tell you why I'm a stickler.
[02:55.780 --> 02:58.140]  It's not the 20,000 words.
[03:00.380 --> 03:01.620]  Is a word not a thing?
[03:02.060 --> 03:02.880]  A word is a thing.
[03:02.960 --> 03:03.400]  You can put a word.
[03:03.460 --> 03:05.140]  So then every word is a thing.
[03:05.280 --> 03:06.300]  You're a fool.
[03:07.200 --> 03:07.840]  That's a thing.
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.720]  Write that down. Write that down.
[03:09.740 --> 03:10.400]  Already did.
[03:10.560 --> 03:11.020]  He's already done it.
[03:14.300 --> 03:16.400]  Okay, so you want physical items?
[03:17.340 --> 03:17.720]  Things.
[03:18.100 --> 03:18.520]  Things.
[03:19.100 --> 03:21.860]  Andrew, I don't know that I agree with Gavin, man.
[03:22.120 --> 03:23.760]  Yeah, I don't understand what he wants.
[03:23.820 --> 03:25.600]  You wanted to write 20,000 words?
[03:26.220 --> 03:27.180]  A word is a thing.
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.440]  A word is a thing.
[03:28.740 --> 03:29.940]  What are you talking about?
[03:30.060 --> 03:31.980]  So write the word, word, then.
[03:32.680 --> 03:33.020]  Okay.
[03:33.520 --> 03:34.600]  Oh, God.
[03:34.700 --> 03:34.980]  There.
[03:35.220 --> 03:35.960]  God damn it.
[03:36.040 --> 03:37.200]  I'm laughing too hard to play.
[03:38.360 --> 03:39.040]  Oh, shit.
[03:39.240 --> 03:40.600]  We had this idea, I think,
[03:40.600 --> 03:43.200]  when we were in Mexico to go like,
[03:43.260 --> 03:44.600]  oh, hey, Andrew should like do this.
[03:44.680 --> 03:46.220]  This will be like fun for a stream.
[03:46.520 --> 03:48.220]  And Gavin...
[03:48.220 --> 03:49.220]  It's not a thing.
[03:49.380 --> 03:50.400]  I eat stinky butts.
[03:50.740 --> 03:51.340]  It's not a thing.
[03:53.460 --> 03:55.460]  How are those not all things?
[03:56.360 --> 03:57.140]  That's not a thing.
[03:57.220 --> 03:58.040]  It's a scenario.
[03:58.440 --> 03:59.820]  Okay, give me five things.
[04:00.360 --> 04:00.840]  Scenario.
[04:02.140 --> 04:03.520]  Hang on. Hang on.
[04:03.720 --> 04:05.780]  How is that different than complaint?
[04:06.380 --> 04:09.140]  I definitely think that if Andrew wrote down scenario,
[04:09.140 --> 04:10.880]  Gavin would be complaining about scenario.
[04:11.460 --> 04:16.100]  What if Andrew just writes down a physical sign that says Gavin eats stinky butts?
[04:16.240 --> 04:16.940]  Then that's a thing.
[04:17.240 --> 04:18.040]  That's a sign.
[04:18.160 --> 04:18.840]  Write down sign.
[04:18.960 --> 04:20.760]  Why is everyone so stupid today?
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.240]  I think, why are you so anti the right?
[04:24.240 --> 04:26.160]  Why did you get so fucking smart?
[04:30.520 --> 04:32.980]  Oh, man, this is going to be a good stream.
[04:33.680 --> 04:36.000]  He's all riled up from sausage talk for some reason.
[04:36.040 --> 04:36.760]  Yeah, no kidding.
[04:37.280 --> 04:38.500]  No, sausage talk was great today.
[04:38.860 --> 04:40.720]  Dude, the rats are killing it right now.
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.440]  You got crushed.
[04:42.620 --> 04:43.480]  Look at these rats.
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.520]  Look at these rats cooking.
[04:44.720 --> 04:45.580]  No, rats!
[04:46.460 --> 04:46.800]  Oh, shit.
[04:46.980 --> 04:47.800]  Oh, shit.
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.260]  God, this game is so good.
[04:49.540 --> 04:50.280]  I love this game.
[04:51.700 --> 04:52.400]  So the con...
[04:52.400 --> 04:55.180]  Are you saying that a thing is not... a concept is not a thing?
[04:56.040 --> 04:56.480]  Wow!
[04:57.480 --> 04:58.360]  Oh, shit.
[04:59.020 --> 04:59.400]  Wow.
[05:00.140 --> 05:01.020]  Tire bolts?
[05:01.360 --> 05:01.920]  That's a thing.
[05:02.380 --> 05:03.040]  Goes on a tire.
[05:03.520 --> 05:03.620]  What?
[05:04.200 --> 05:05.760]  Geoff Van Gundy.
[05:07.080 --> 05:07.760]  He's a thing.
[05:07.760 --> 05:08.960]  Stan Van Gundy.
[05:10.680 --> 05:12.100]  Both Van Gundys are things.
[05:12.200 --> 05:12.520]  No!
[05:12.640 --> 05:13.520]  Oh, wow.
[05:14.040 --> 05:14.400]  Come on.
[05:18.630 --> 05:20.220]  Really coming at Gavin here.
[05:23.220 --> 05:24.460]  So, like...
[05:24.460 --> 05:25.040]  No!
[05:26.220 --> 05:27.640]  Fuck myself, dude.
[05:28.000 --> 05:28.360]  Rats live.
[05:30.780 --> 05:32.920]  You're going nuts, Andrew.
[05:34.480 --> 05:36.540]  How are you even looking at it, Gavin?
[05:36.540 --> 05:39.740]  How do you even have the capacity to look over at it?
[05:40.020 --> 05:41.380]  I gotta keep my eye on him.
[05:41.500 --> 05:42.280]  He's got a...
[05:42.280 --> 05:43.400]  Why didn't I make it?
[05:43.480 --> 05:45.080]  I was right next to Nick and Nick made it.
[05:45.380 --> 05:48.440]  Yeah, I think you were watching...
[05:48.440 --> 05:48.680]  Wow!
[05:48.860 --> 05:53.220]  A norther breeze pushing a singular...
[05:54.140 --> 05:55.100]  Northern wind.
[05:56.520 --> 05:58.100]  Texas is norther than Canada.
[05:58.300 --> 05:59.520]  Somebody's looking out the window.
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.180]  Southern wind.
[06:02.740 --> 06:05.160]  A droplet of milk from a cow.
[06:05.160 --> 06:06.720]  You could also list cow.
[06:07.000 --> 06:08.300]  Or chocolate milk.
[06:08.520 --> 06:08.660]  Or milk.
[06:09.540 --> 06:12.860]  Or a different droplet of milk from a different cow.
[06:13.180 --> 06:14.140]  What else does milk...
[06:14.140 --> 06:15.580]  What does milk come in, Andrew?
[06:15.780 --> 06:17.200]  Droplet of pain.
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.820]  This is insane.
[06:19.100 --> 06:20.120]  Do you mean paint?
[06:20.540 --> 06:20.800]  Come.
[06:21.420 --> 06:22.260]  Alright, hang on.
[06:22.520 --> 06:22.700]  What?
[06:23.000 --> 06:23.160]  Oh.
[06:27.140 --> 06:31.000]  How the fuck are we supposed to race through this comedy?
[06:31.440 --> 06:33.860]  I can't look at the screen.
[06:33.860 --> 06:35.280]  I'm too busy looking at Andrew's list.
[06:35.380 --> 06:35.900]  No!
[06:38.320 --> 06:39.360]  Job opportunity.
[06:40.300 --> 06:41.520]  Damn, that job opportunity.
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.040]  Hey, buddy, pretty close.
[06:43.400 --> 06:44.480]  No, it's just...
[06:45.060 --> 06:45.720]  That's the thing, right?
[06:45.800 --> 06:46.600]  What the...
[06:47.120 --> 06:47.900]  I was crushed.
[06:48.200 --> 06:49.000]  Oh, me too.
[06:49.820 --> 06:51.280]  These logs are brutal.
[06:51.680 --> 06:52.980]  Damn these damn things.
[06:53.320 --> 06:53.660]  Got them.
[06:55.240 --> 06:56.600]  Get shot. Bullet gun.
[06:56.880 --> 06:57.780]  Oh, Geoff.
[06:58.500 --> 06:59.060]  Bullet gun.
[06:59.120 --> 07:00.060]  Write down bullet gun.
[07:00.500 --> 07:01.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:02.260 --> 07:03.440]  BULLET GUN!
[07:04.780 --> 07:05.880]  Oh, God.
[07:06.040 --> 07:06.740]  Yes, got him.
[07:07.200 --> 07:07.840]  No, die.
[07:15.680 --> 07:18.160]  We're taking streaming to another level.
[07:18.360 --> 07:20.320]  He doesn't write bullet and gun.
[07:20.440 --> 07:21.640]  He writes bullet gun.
[07:23.980 --> 07:24.660]  No!
[07:26.660 --> 07:27.340]  Live!
[07:27.780 --> 07:28.000]  No!
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  Oh, dude.
[07:30.920 --> 07:32.220]  Dude, Andrew, what?
[07:32.340 --> 07:33.080]  Come on.
[07:33.460 --> 07:37.420]  Have you got a keyboard full of cheese or something?
[07:37.560 --> 07:37.940]  What's going on?
[07:38.160 --> 07:40.100]  I'm trying to fight through my mic.
[07:41.060 --> 07:41.400]  What?
[07:41.580 --> 07:42.220]  Fight through my mic?
[07:42.680 --> 07:45.460]  Because my mic is blocking my arms.
[07:46.080 --> 07:46.760]  Fightin' mic.
[07:47.340 --> 07:49.260]  You gotta fight for your right to be on mic.
[07:49.280 --> 07:49.900]  Oh, come on.
[07:51.700 --> 07:52.440]  No, no!
[07:53.200 --> 07:55.420]  Fucking rats are doing it.
[07:56.360 --> 07:57.720]  I got killed by the safety.
[08:00.540 --> 08:03.280]  Dude, total rat domination today.
[08:03.380 --> 08:04.120]  Look at this.
[08:04.540 --> 08:05.840]  Rats are locked in.
[08:05.980 --> 08:07.860]  Kill it, kill it.
[08:08.100 --> 08:09.160]  What's a Korbrat?
[08:09.620 --> 08:10.820]  Gun with a giant knife.
[08:11.340 --> 08:12.360]  Knife that is sharp.
[08:12.720 --> 08:13.660]  Knife that is dull.
[08:14.820 --> 08:16.420]  We're gonna go through this list.
[08:16.800 --> 08:20.960]  At the end of your 20,000 things and you're gonna be cut down to like 16,000.
[08:21.840 --> 08:23.720]  Thank you, Clunchmeister.
[08:25.320 --> 08:27.020]  Oh, this is from Clunchmeister?
[08:27.020 --> 08:27.740]  Yeah.
[08:28.640 --> 08:29.980]  Clunchmeister gifted some subs.
[08:30.220 --> 08:31.200]  Yeah, they gifted some subs.
[08:31.460 --> 08:32.140]  Thank you.

[08:33.560 --> 08:34.480]  Yeah, bucket of water.
[08:36.000 --> 08:36.880]  Generous person.
[08:37.020 --> 08:38.300]  See, now we're getting into it.
[08:40.300 --> 08:41.840]  Is that in reference to someone?
[08:42.500 --> 08:43.940]  It shot me ahead.
[08:44.180 --> 08:44.720]  I'm powerful!
[08:45.080 --> 08:45.400]  No!
[08:45.880 --> 08:46.360]  Live!
[08:47.240 --> 08:48.020]  Oh, you did live.
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.100]  Holy shit.
[08:49.200 --> 08:49.620]  Holy shit.
[08:49.860 --> 08:50.420]  Oh, Gavin!
[08:50.940 --> 08:51.440]  Oh, Nick!
[08:53.120 --> 08:53.800]  I'm on the back!
[08:54.300 --> 08:55.060]  No, no, no, no!
[08:55.340 --> 08:55.820]  Yes!
[08:55.820 --> 08:56.820]  Oh, God, fuck.
[08:57.280 --> 08:58.000]  Rats, live!
[08:59.780 --> 09:01.060]  Rats about to die.
[09:01.520 --> 09:02.540]  Oh, you dick!
[09:05.480 --> 09:06.280]  Hollis Queens.
[09:06.600 --> 09:07.700]  He's writing lyrics.
[09:08.280 --> 09:09.880]  Steve, but this is where you should be going.
[09:10.560 --> 09:12.900]  Run DMC, Hollis Queens, Queens of the Stone Age.
[09:13.000 --> 09:13.760]  You're doing it right.
[09:14.120 --> 09:15.860]  That's the way you should be listing it, man.
[09:18.100 --> 09:19.560]  Free flowin' all the way.
[09:20.260 --> 09:22.900]  So this gets tacked onto the list he has so far?
[09:22.960 --> 09:23.580]  Is that how this works?
[09:23.700 --> 09:24.180]  Oh, definitely.
[09:24.180 --> 09:25.660]  Yeah, because he's listing it.
[09:25.940 --> 09:26.500]  Oh, Gavin.
[09:29.580 --> 09:30.380]  Oh, Gavin!
[09:30.700 --> 09:31.520]  Rats, rats only.
[09:31.800 --> 09:32.300]  Rats only.
[09:32.560 --> 09:33.080]  Rats only.
[09:34.980 --> 09:36.920]  Oh, God, this rat rules today, baby.
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.360]  This rat's fired up!
[09:38.820 --> 09:39.840]  Good God damn, son.
[09:41.000 --> 09:41.280]  I win!
[09:41.340 --> 09:42.080]  Come on, first place.
[09:42.560 --> 09:43.540]  I had to get first place.
[09:43.980 --> 09:44.600]  No, not a chance.
[09:47.080 --> 09:47.480]  Perfect.
[09:49.220 --> 09:49.780]  That's the thing.
[09:50.220 --> 09:51.760]  I don't know what a fuckery is, but it's a thing.
[09:51.840 --> 09:52.240]  How did Nick get it?
[09:52.240 --> 09:55.240]  How did he get a comeback bonus when I came in first?
[09:55.900 --> 09:56.460]  This is bullshit.
[09:56.520 --> 09:56.800]  Yeah!
[09:56.960 --> 09:57.660]  How did that happen?
[09:58.600 --> 09:59.960]  Car wash the movie.
[10:02.180 --> 10:02.680]  What?
[10:03.560 --> 10:04.060]  Comeback?
[10:05.400 --> 10:05.940]  Nick said it.
[10:06.600 --> 10:06.880]  Yep.
[10:07.680 --> 10:08.600]  What about what?
[10:08.680 --> 10:09.500]  How do you feel about that, Gavin?
[10:11.560 --> 10:11.800]  Huh.
[10:11.860 --> 10:12.020]  What?
[10:13.820 --> 10:15.420]  What and her aren't things.
[10:19.200 --> 10:20.200]  It's confusion.
[10:20.500 --> 10:20.960]  That's a thing.
[10:24.580 --> 10:25.800]  God damn it.
[10:25.880 --> 10:26.320]  Yes.
[10:26.620 --> 10:28.020]  Every fucking time.
[10:28.320 --> 10:28.460]  Oh shit.
[10:28.760 --> 10:31.500]  God, I just, I am dominating the first part of this track.
[10:32.520 --> 10:32.960]  God!
[10:32.960 --> 10:33.240]  No!
[10:34.200 --> 10:34.260]  Yes!
[10:35.740 --> 10:36.120]  There we go.
[10:38.100 --> 10:38.980]  Rat domination.
[10:40.640 --> 10:41.080]  No!
[10:42.340 --> 10:42.780]  I'm in hell!
[10:43.440 --> 10:44.000]  Sorry, Geoff.
[10:45.620 --> 10:47.460]  Oh, see, now he's getting into seeds.
[10:47.580 --> 10:48.240]  This is good.
[10:48.820 --> 10:49.120]  Seeds?
[10:49.200 --> 10:49.780]  What kind of seeds?
[10:49.920 --> 10:50.720]  Pumpkin seeds.
[10:50.720 --> 10:51.320]  Watermelon seeds.
[10:51.320 --> 10:54.060]  Corn, popcorn, pumpkin, grape, watermelon.
[10:54.200 --> 10:54.940]  He's doing it all, baby.
[10:55.040 --> 10:56.320]  Oh, he can do colonel, too.
[10:56.460 --> 10:56.820]  Wow.
[10:56.960 --> 10:57.620]  What an advantage.
[10:57.800 --> 11:00.080]  And he can do major and general and private.
[11:00.700 --> 11:03.520]  That's how you got, that's how you have to listen to 20,000 things.
[11:03.680 --> 11:06.300]  You gotta just go like freewheel it, baby.
[11:06.860 --> 11:08.860]  But he can also do major general as one.
[11:09.080 --> 11:09.500]  That's true.
[11:10.020 --> 11:10.320]  Yeah.
[11:11.060 --> 11:11.660]  Major, major.
[11:12.420 --> 11:13.520]  Major, major.
[11:13.660 --> 11:13.840]  Yeah.
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.060]  Master chief.
[11:15.780 --> 11:16.540]  Master chief.
[11:16.540 --> 11:16.880]  Master chief.
[11:19.440 --> 11:21.020]  Oh, I get a little pinballed around.
[11:21.720 --> 11:21.840]  Good.
[11:22.820 --> 11:23.260]  Hmm.
[11:23.800 --> 11:24.280]  Gun!
[11:26.020 --> 11:26.820]  Bullet gun?
[11:28.560 --> 11:29.400]  Don't touch me!
[11:31.000 --> 11:31.480]  No!
[11:31.760 --> 11:32.020]  Yes!
[11:32.580 --> 11:34.100]  Ah, shit, shite, shit.
[11:34.100 --> 11:34.280]  Oh, shit.
[11:34.580 --> 11:34.960]  Yes!
[11:35.680 --> 11:36.040]  No.
[11:37.220 --> 11:37.700]  Oh!
[11:37.820 --> 11:38.100]  No!
[11:38.940 --> 11:39.820]  Yes, it's still finished.
[11:39.940 --> 11:40.440]  I think I won.
[11:40.960 --> 11:41.480]  Boom, baby.
[11:41.600 --> 11:42.700]  First one goes to the rats.
[11:42.780 --> 11:44.260]  You know the rats are here, baby.
[11:44.800 --> 11:45.860]  Ain't no one catching me.
[11:47.140 --> 11:49.440]  Tcentia with a shitload of subs.
[11:49.780 --> 11:50.880]  Oh, thank you.
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.000]  How many was that, 20?
[11:52.680 --> 11:53.480]  Holy shit, thanks.
[11:53.620 --> 11:53.780]  Damn.
[11:54.240 --> 11:54.580]  Dude.
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.880]  If you bet on the rats, you know you bet on the best, baby.
[11:58.140 --> 12:01.220]  If you bet on the piss rats, you know you bet on the best.
[12:01.300 --> 12:03.060]  Let's see some piss rats in the chat for Eric.
[12:03.060 --> 12:04.580]  Come on, no, corn cats, what?
[12:04.680 --> 12:05.560]  Come on, get real.
[12:05.860 --> 12:06.160]  Not piss rats.
[12:06.340 --> 12:07.400]  You heard him say it himself.
[12:07.540 --> 12:08.640]  Rats in the chat.
[12:08.760 --> 12:09.500]  Piss rats in the chat.
[12:10.760 --> 12:11.840]  Lap it up, rat man.
[12:12.120 --> 12:14.360]  So wait, you wrote piss rat, then you wrote piss rats?
[12:14.620 --> 12:15.500]  How does Gavin feel about that?
[12:16.060 --> 12:17.060]  That's the same thing.
[12:17.780 --> 12:19.180]  Yeah, that doesn't count.
[12:19.980 --> 12:21.580]  You can do piss rat and piss rat.
[12:21.840 --> 12:22.420]  Or piss hat.
[12:22.980 --> 12:23.640]  Piss is a thing.
[12:24.480 --> 12:25.360]  Piss off.
[12:32.060 --> 12:33.700]  Alright, I'm going to change the game mode.
[12:33.780 --> 12:34.440]  Nobody go anywhere.
[12:34.600 --> 12:35.720]  We're going to turn it on chaos.
[12:36.740 --> 12:37.180]  Shit.
[12:37.560 --> 12:37.740]  Yeah.
[12:38.500 --> 12:39.480]  Alright, we're in.
[12:39.620 --> 12:40.580]  Chaos mode activated.
[12:41.140 --> 12:42.380]  You don't go for churros.
[12:42.620 --> 12:44.800]  You go for eating a bunch of churros.
[12:51.880 --> 12:54.260]  Man, your mic is really in front of your arms, isn't it?
[12:54.980 --> 12:55.720]  I'm working.
[12:58.520 --> 13:01.140]  You didn't think to like reposition your mic for this?
[13:01.440 --> 13:02.680]  Well, it's just the angle.
[13:02.780 --> 13:04.560]  No matter what I do, it's a little better.
[13:04.720 --> 13:06.200]  I don't type using this laptop.
[13:06.680 --> 13:07.060]  I'm sorry.
[13:07.180 --> 13:08.040]  I didn't mean to Gavin that.
[13:09.680 --> 13:10.520]  It's pretty good.
[13:10.620 --> 13:11.120]  It's pretty good.
[13:11.360 --> 13:11.760]  Gavin.
[13:11.940 --> 13:12.300]  Pretty good.
[13:12.700 --> 13:12.900]  Yep.
[13:15.500 --> 13:16.480]  That is a thing.
[13:16.660 --> 13:18.040]  I'm going to stick with the Jono.
[13:18.260 --> 13:19.100]  I like this one.
[13:20.600 --> 13:21.120]  Yeah.
[13:21.780 --> 13:22.480]  Got that.
[13:22.800 --> 13:23.000]  No offense, Gavin.
[13:23.540 --> 13:23.860]  There we go.
[13:24.000 --> 13:24.340]  None taken.
[13:24.900 --> 13:25.120]  Okay.
[13:27.480 --> 13:28.700]  Oh my god.
[13:29.160 --> 13:30.120]  Age my grandfather.
[13:30.220 --> 13:31.020]  Oh my god.
[13:31.460 --> 13:31.760]  What?
[13:33.600 --> 13:34.920]  Oh my god.
[13:38.580 --> 13:40.420]  I had two of them.
[13:44.640 --> 13:45.240]  Oh, wow.
[13:45.260 --> 13:46.240]  We're just going down.
[13:46.520 --> 13:48.380]  This is just a track that goes down.
[13:49.100 --> 13:50.980]  And Gavin is going to boost us.
[13:51.300 --> 13:52.200]  Are your shortcuts on?
[13:52.540 --> 13:52.760]  No.
[13:52.900 --> 13:53.720]  How do I turn it around?
[13:53.840 --> 13:54.400]  Oh, damn.
[13:54.640 --> 13:56.520]  What does shortcuts do?
[13:56.820 --> 13:57.600]  There you go.
[13:58.100 --> 13:59.100]  Jump the track.
[13:59.380 --> 14:00.280]  Does that let us do the track?
[14:00.820 --> 14:01.180]  Yeah.
[14:01.540 --> 14:02.060]  Oh, wow.
[14:02.500 --> 14:04.820]  If you land it perfectly, everyone behind you dies.
[14:05.040 --> 14:05.540]  Oh, wow.
[14:06.000 --> 14:06.240]  All right.
[14:06.240 --> 14:07.220]  I'll turn it on for the next one.
[14:07.920 --> 14:08.760]  Oh, it's not on now?
[14:09.020 --> 14:09.200]  Damn it.
[14:09.200 --> 14:09.400]  No.
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.340]  That was the whole conversation.
[14:12.340 --> 14:12.820]  Why did I not finish?
[14:13.040 --> 14:13.240]  How did I blow up?
[14:13.240 --> 14:14.040]  How did you die?
[14:14.580 --> 14:16.360]  That didn't make any goddamn sense.
[14:16.480 --> 14:17.420]  It didn't make any sense.
[14:17.420 --> 14:18.680]  The game was like, oh, Geoff's doing well.
[14:18.940 --> 14:19.580]  Fucking nope.
[14:19.720 --> 14:20.100]  Come on.
[14:21.300 --> 14:23.260]  This isn't even the hard part.
[14:23.560 --> 14:24.560]  This is hell on earth.
[14:26.960 --> 14:28.640]  Death sentence question mark?
[14:29.380 --> 14:29.820]  What?
[14:30.020 --> 14:33.560]  Instead of write a bunch of summer activities, you wrote summer activities.
[14:39.620 --> 14:42.360]  It's the same as writing a list of things as a thing.
[14:42.680 --> 14:43.260]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[14:43.320 --> 14:43.920]  You should list that.
[14:45.060 --> 14:45.900]  The sack!
[14:46.060 --> 14:47.120]  Wow, do you got sacked?
[14:47.120 --> 14:47.780]  Oh, shit.
[14:51.200 --> 14:53.240]  Dude, this track sucks.
[14:53.660 --> 14:59.640]  I cannot believe how well this idea has gone with Andrew listening to him play.
[14:59.860 --> 15:04.840]  Okay, so he listed summer activities as one thing, but here are all the pretzels.
[15:05.740 --> 15:06.860]  Those are different things.
[15:07.320 --> 15:07.720]  He's laughing.
[15:07.720 --> 15:09.000]  They're all different things.
[15:10.180 --> 15:11.900]  He's off his shit today.
[15:16.040 --> 15:20.240]  This might be up there with sloppy bingo is one of my favorite things to do now.
[15:20.660 --> 15:22.180]  This might be a new way to stream, man.
[15:22.260 --> 15:23.160]  This is pretty good.
[15:24.420 --> 15:25.260]  Oh my god.
[15:34.000 --> 15:34.880]  Come on!
[15:37.900 --> 15:39.220]  No one finished.
[15:39.740 --> 15:40.300]  Look at that.
[15:43.870 --> 15:45.230]  Finish line, Andrew.
[15:46.430 --> 15:47.990]  No, I sprunged!
[15:48.230 --> 15:49.430]  I springed!
[15:49.470 --> 15:50.050]  I sprung!
[15:51.790 --> 15:53.110]  Yeah, no!
[15:55.030 --> 15:56.190]  My trampoline!
[15:57.670 --> 15:58.310]  Trampopoline!
[15:59.270 --> 15:59.910]  Trampopoline!
[16:00.650 --> 16:01.290]  Trampapoline!
[16:02.850 --> 16:04.130]  Oh, god.
[16:04.530 --> 16:06.870]  Oh, I guess no matter what you do, you're just stuck on that.
[16:06.870 --> 16:07.830]  Son of a bitch!
[16:07.950 --> 16:09.870]  There's his fucking just anus.
[16:12.010 --> 16:12.990]  Yes!
[16:13.750 --> 16:14.240]  Rats!
[16:15.730 --> 16:16.590]  What's a come line?
[16:19.970 --> 16:21.510]  Nick said finish line.
[16:24.590 --> 16:25.080]  Rats!
[16:26.050 --> 16:27.470]  Let me go, Eric!
[16:28.330 --> 16:29.310]  Rats!
[16:30.050 --> 16:30.430]  Eric!
[16:30.490 --> 16:32.850]  Oh, shit!
[16:34.830 --> 16:35.090]  No!
[16:35.590 --> 16:37.010]  Gavin, the confusion button!
[16:45.250 --> 16:46.290]  Oh, man.
[16:48.050 --> 16:50.750]  Gavin, I don't know what's funnier right now.
[16:51.010 --> 16:51.990]  It's so great.
[16:52.590 --> 16:55.590]  God, there's too much to laugh at in this stream.
[16:55.890 --> 16:56.470]  This is great.
[16:57.170 --> 16:58.950]  We're next level right now, dude.
[16:59.230 --> 17:01.350]  Yeah, this is stream innovation.
[17:01.790 --> 17:02.850]  Yeah, this is pretty good.
[17:02.850 --> 17:08.490]  We're combining fucking video games and supplemental content in ways no one's ever dreamed.
[17:08.550 --> 17:08.930]  Gavin!
[17:09.530 --> 17:10.170]  Jesus.
[17:11.290 --> 17:12.510]  John C. Eiley.
[17:17.730 --> 17:21.870]  Oh, you fucking turd of a human.
[17:22.530 --> 17:23.730]  Why put that there?
[17:24.370 --> 17:24.910]  No!
[17:25.410 --> 17:25.990]  Die, Eric!
[17:26.010 --> 17:26.590]  Yes, rats!
[17:27.450 --> 17:28.290]  No!
[17:29.130 --> 17:29.970]  Idiot!
[17:32.850 --> 17:33.490]  Dick.
[17:36.390 --> 17:37.310]  Yes!
[17:37.990 --> 17:39.310]  Oh, I almost came back!
[17:39.630 --> 17:40.450]  Rats!
[17:42.630 --> 17:44.370]  Why did it have me go sideways?
[17:45.890 --> 17:46.490]  No!
[17:46.630 --> 17:47.390]  Yes!
[17:48.470 --> 17:49.090]  No!
[17:50.450 --> 17:53.450]  Yeah, go to hell, Eric!
[18:00.930 --> 18:02.690]  Eat my mines!
[18:03.010 --> 18:03.750]  Oh, shit!
[18:04.310 --> 18:04.770]  Eat my balls!
[18:04.930 --> 18:05.350]  Oh, no!
[18:06.790 --> 18:07.650]  Alright, fellas.
[18:08.330 --> 18:09.250]  I'm big now.
[18:11.770 --> 18:12.810]  Oh, wow.
[18:16.010 --> 18:18.630]  Wow, I was in first place for just a second.
[18:18.730 --> 18:19.370]  That's pretty crazy.
[18:19.590 --> 18:21.170]  Big bottle of olive oil.
[18:21.930 --> 18:22.890]  Johnny, be good.
[18:22.890 --> 18:23.870]  Paul Giamatti.
[18:24.110 --> 18:25.150]  Oh, right through Rhino.
[18:26.270 --> 18:27.350]  Oh, yeah, Rhino.
[18:27.670 --> 18:28.930]  Oh, insane man.
[18:29.130 --> 18:30.010]  I didn't even think about that.
[18:32.870 --> 18:33.750]  That's a thing.
[18:34.610 --> 18:35.790]  Gray and George of the Jungle.
[18:36.110 --> 18:36.670]  Okay, hang on.
[18:36.850 --> 18:38.070]  So you just went Spider-Man.
[18:38.210 --> 18:39.590]  We just gave you a...
[18:39.590 --> 18:40.330]  Hang on.
[18:43.750 --> 18:45.070]  I'm gonna throw up.
[18:47.590 --> 18:48.630]  David Boyne.
[18:51.210 --> 18:52.250]  This is...
[18:52.250 --> 18:54.210]  He was in and out of his John era.
[18:54.790 --> 18:55.270]  No!
[18:56.190 --> 18:57.150]  I'm already dead.
[18:57.270 --> 18:57.830]  It doesn't matter.
[18:58.270 --> 18:59.270]  Eric, I think...
[18:59.790 --> 19:00.370]  Oh, fuck.
[19:01.710 --> 19:04.390]  I think you were the one that came up with this idea.
[19:04.530 --> 19:05.590]  This is brilliant, man.
[19:05.670 --> 19:07.410]  I'm very happy about it.
[19:07.470 --> 19:08.530]  Credit where credit is due.
[19:08.670 --> 19:09.190]  I'm just...
[19:09.190 --> 19:11.450]  I'm very happy with how it's turning out.
[19:12.510 --> 19:13.750]  God damn it!
[19:13.770 --> 19:14.290]  I live!
[19:14.430 --> 19:14.770]  Please, no!
[19:14.770 --> 19:18.030]  I hate that trampoline so goddamn much.
[19:18.430 --> 19:18.530]  Yep.
[19:20.930 --> 19:22.330]  All right, all right.
[19:22.330 --> 19:23.730]  I hate the laughter even more.
[19:24.450 --> 19:24.930]  Why?
[19:25.870 --> 19:26.230]  I laugh.
[19:26.590 --> 19:27.590]  Don't kill me.
[19:28.110 --> 19:28.590]  David!
[19:30.930 --> 19:31.650]  How did I...
[19:32.530 --> 19:33.010]  Weed!
[19:33.730 --> 19:35.830]  He just wrote weed.
[19:37.730 --> 19:38.690]  Like the...
[19:38.690 --> 19:39.250]  Yeah, okay.
[19:39.490 --> 19:40.170]  I'm not gonna ask.
[19:41.270 --> 19:43.090]  Did it just put us on the next section?
[19:43.150 --> 19:43.670]  I think it did.
[19:44.690 --> 19:46.310]  It was so kind to us.
[19:46.310 --> 19:48.650]  Oh my god, you got sacked.
[19:48.690 --> 19:49.470]  Get railed!
[19:51.730 --> 19:53.750]  Those balls were there for you, man.
[19:54.410 --> 19:55.110]  A goo!
[19:56.830 --> 19:58.130]  Oh, I got my own goo.
[20:00.670 --> 20:01.530]  Where's the...
[20:01.530 --> 20:02.390]  Rats!
[20:02.850 --> 20:03.270]  I'm dead!
[20:03.490 --> 20:03.830]  No!
[20:07.650 --> 20:08.890]  PlayStation 12?
[20:09.370 --> 20:09.690]  What?
[20:14.770 --> 20:16.010]  PlayStation 12?
[20:18.370 --> 20:19.170]  He's optimistic.
[20:21.750 --> 20:22.710]  Why did I... what?
[20:24.350 --> 20:26.550]  This might be the longest run I've ever had in my life.
[20:30.410 --> 20:30.810]  Rats!
[20:31.390 --> 20:32.090]  Why'd you kill me, Gavin?
[20:32.170 --> 20:32.850]  What happened there?
[20:33.010 --> 20:34.290]  What happened there?
[20:34.390 --> 20:35.390]  I got lagged out of the...
[20:35.390 --> 20:36.810]  I didn't even see the spawn.
[20:38.330 --> 20:38.970]  It stopped...
[20:38.970 --> 20:40.050]  What's going on?
[20:40.390 --> 20:40.670]  What?
[20:40.910 --> 20:41.130]  What?
[20:41.530 --> 20:42.730]  The scream went all jank.
[20:43.130 --> 20:44.270]  Yeah, it was all weird on me too.
[20:44.830 --> 20:45.350]  Just win.
[20:46.250 --> 20:46.970]  Maybe you should play on PC.
[20:48.110 --> 20:49.290]  I am on PC!
[20:49.850 --> 20:49.990]  Tell him, Nick.
[20:49.990 --> 20:50.850]  I was talking to Gavin.
[20:51.050 --> 20:51.610]  Tell him, Nick.
[20:51.710 --> 20:52.410]  Let him know.
[20:52.690 --> 20:53.190]  Talk to him.
[20:55.250 --> 20:57.470]  Wait, did you write how again?
[20:57.590 --> 20:59.190]  I feel like you already had how on your list.
[21:00.090 --> 21:01.250]  Wait, how is it... what?
[21:02.110 --> 21:04.810]  You know that thing, where did my coin go?
[21:08.430 --> 21:11.870]  Gavin, you keep...
[21:12.870 --> 21:15.970]  The expression, where did my coin go?
[21:15.970 --> 21:17.490]  That's the thing.
[21:18.150 --> 21:20.270]  Gavin, the classic expression.
[21:20.890 --> 21:22.330]  The thing we're constantly saying.
[21:25.290 --> 21:26.530]  I don't know where I am.
[21:26.610 --> 21:26.710]  Oh god.
[21:26.890 --> 21:27.270]  I'm off.
[21:28.010 --> 21:28.710]  I'm alive.
[21:33.310 --> 21:34.270]  Personal compter.
[21:35.750 --> 21:36.710]  John Denver.
[21:37.490 --> 21:38.450]  Personal compter.
[21:38.710 --> 21:39.410]  Oh, right, Denver.
[21:39.550 --> 21:40.290]  Also right, Denver.
[21:40.510 --> 21:41.670]  I can't play.
[21:43.510 --> 21:44.470]  Personal computer.
[21:44.470 --> 21:46.550]  You wrote Denver without...
[21:46.550 --> 21:47.630]  John Denver.
[21:49.030 --> 21:50.650]  John Cougar Melon Camp.
[21:51.010 --> 21:52.930]  He came in and out, and he's back in Johns.
[21:53.490 --> 21:54.050]  Then Cougar.
[21:54.590 --> 21:56.330]  Mickey Blue Eyes.
[22:01.130 --> 22:02.650]  That's the dream we have every time.
[22:07.410 --> 22:09.590]  Oh my god.
[22:14.530 --> 22:15.730]  Let me play.
[22:16.170 --> 22:17.790]  Nick is struggling.
[22:17.950 --> 22:18.910]  He's getting bullied.
[22:21.910 --> 22:23.250]  Alright, hold it together.
[22:23.930 --> 22:25.790]  Snake Eye is the thing, not the movie.
[22:26.670 --> 22:27.490]  They are things.
[22:28.130 --> 22:28.690]  They are things.
[22:30.730 --> 22:32.630]  Snake Eye is the character, also a good one.
[22:33.010 --> 22:33.950]  Or the dice roll.
[22:35.570 --> 22:36.510]  Snake Eye is dice.
[22:36.670 --> 22:37.210]  Oh, that's good.
[22:37.450 --> 22:37.610]  Oh, dice.
[22:37.710 --> 22:38.890]  Just put dice.
[22:41.530 --> 22:42.470]  Put roulette.
[22:43.290 --> 22:45.730]  We can't beat the fucking first ten feet.
[22:46.390 --> 22:48.870]  This is what happens when Gavin plays.
[22:48.950 --> 22:50.450]  Yeah, I see what you mean, man.
[22:50.530 --> 22:53.610]  It's real fucking...
[22:53.610 --> 22:54.190]  Oh, no.
[22:55.950 --> 22:56.550]  Annoying.
[23:00.410 --> 23:02.830]  That was so close.
[23:06.570 --> 23:08.230]  I think it was nice to us.
[23:09.250 --> 23:10.790]  Oh, yeah.
[23:11.810 --> 23:13.570]  Well, I'm still an idiot.
[23:14.410 --> 23:16.270]  I hit a mine.
[23:16.570 --> 23:19.530]  Oh my god.
[23:20.010 --> 23:21.950]  Pineapple smoothie sounds good.
[23:23.170 --> 23:25.450]  I don't understand this...
[23:25.450 --> 23:26.190]  Okay.
[23:28.010 --> 23:30.530]  It's just your methodology, Andrews.
[23:31.050 --> 23:32.230]  The calculator.
[23:35.470 --> 23:37.010]  Oh my god.
[23:37.370 --> 23:38.170]  I got bullied off.
[23:38.170 --> 23:38.490]  I'm smashing people.
[23:41.590 --> 23:43.450]  Rats, I don't know about this one.
[23:43.710 --> 23:44.410]  What?
[23:44.670 --> 23:45.510]  God damn it.
[23:46.430 --> 23:47.970]  You went out of the hole.
[23:49.770 --> 23:50.370]  Oh, Geoff.
[23:51.090 --> 23:52.150]  The concept...
[23:52.150 --> 23:52.330]  Bongo.
[23:52.730 --> 23:54.970]  This is so fucking funny.
[23:56.550 --> 23:57.170]  Stop.
[24:03.890 --> 24:05.290]  Welcome back.
[24:06.850 --> 24:07.870]  All right.
[24:08.270 --> 24:08.770]  No.
[24:08.890 --> 24:09.690]  Off the edge.
[24:10.790 --> 24:11.770]  Oh, he's in the fills.
[24:14.870 --> 24:15.670]  Oh, Jesus.
[24:16.690 --> 24:17.090]  No.
[24:17.770 --> 24:18.390]  Oh, no.
[24:21.250 --> 24:21.970]  No, Eric.
[24:24.290 --> 24:24.930]  Still in it.
[24:24.990 --> 24:25.530]  Nice job, Eric.
[24:27.950 --> 24:29.190]  You bastard man.
[24:29.330 --> 24:29.930]  You deserved it.
[24:29.990 --> 24:30.830]  You deserved it.
[24:31.030 --> 24:32.210]  Nick the bastard man, right?
[24:32.270 --> 24:33.190]  Nick the bastard man.
[24:34.450 --> 24:35.050]  Stop it.
[24:36.350 --> 24:36.750]  Damn.
[24:37.810 --> 24:38.410]  Ah.
[24:39.890 --> 24:40.670]  Thank you.
[24:40.810 --> 24:41.710]  Thank you, Andrew.
[24:42.070 --> 24:42.450]  No problem.
[24:44.090 --> 24:45.350]  Did you write Nick the bastard man?
[24:45.670 --> 24:46.270]  Yes.
[24:46.570 --> 24:47.730]  Right off the edge.
[24:47.930 --> 24:49.150]  Right off the edge.
[24:49.210 --> 24:50.010]  At the end.
[24:53.750 --> 24:55.570]  Philadelphia cream cheese.
[24:57.890 --> 24:59.090]  Phil Collins.
[24:59.350 --> 24:59.810]  Philadelphia.
[25:01.110 --> 25:03.750]  What is your methodology, Andrew?
[25:04.750 --> 25:07.970]  He's like bouncing around in little niches.
[25:08.170 --> 25:09.170]  He never...
[25:09.170 --> 25:10.190]  I really like it.
[25:10.270 --> 25:10.830]  It's crazy.
[25:11.470 --> 25:11.910]  Bruce Springsteen.
[25:12.170 --> 25:12.790]  Rocky.
[25:13.270 --> 25:14.290]  He's on the Rockies.
[25:17.090 --> 25:17.930]  Rokey.
[25:21.210 --> 25:23.070]  Didn't list Rocky for.
[25:24.710 --> 25:26.510]  Oh, Gavin.
[25:26.770 --> 25:27.690]  Rokey too.
[25:28.190 --> 25:28.630]  Gavin.
[25:29.630 --> 25:30.250]  What's up, Nick?
[25:31.150 --> 25:31.770]  Oh, God.
[25:32.150 --> 25:32.750]  I just...
[25:34.510 --> 25:35.310]  Expendables 3.
[25:40.170 --> 25:40.570]  No.
[25:43.970 --> 25:45.670]  Almost passed it on the first try.
[25:47.710 --> 25:48.510]  UFC 120.
[25:50.370 --> 25:51.870]  Oh, you can list all of them.
[25:52.110 --> 25:54.270]  Yeah, but he's got UFC 120 on there, you know?
[25:54.310 --> 25:56.410]  What's the next UFC 311, I think?
[25:56.730 --> 25:57.130]  Yeah.
[25:58.330 --> 25:59.990]  Did they just announce a new main event?
[26:01.230 --> 26:02.670]  Yeah, they had to swap some fights around.
[26:02.670 --> 26:03.210]  Yeah.
[26:03.570 --> 26:04.070]  Crazy.
[26:04.550 --> 26:05.030]  Fight swap.
[26:05.470 --> 26:06.170]  Write down fight swap.
[26:07.910 --> 26:08.750]  Fight swap.
[26:09.970 --> 26:10.370]  Cum swap.
[26:11.350 --> 26:11.710]  Okay.
[26:12.670 --> 26:14.570]  He was in the cum world before.
[26:15.130 --> 26:15.630]  Well...
[26:15.630 --> 26:15.810]  No!
[26:16.670 --> 26:17.370]  Drugs swap.
[26:17.570 --> 26:19.430]  He wrote drugs swap.
[26:20.390 --> 26:21.070]  Hold on, Gavin!
[26:21.190 --> 26:21.650]  Hold on!
[26:21.810 --> 26:22.110]  Yes!
[26:25.390 --> 26:26.570]  Just hit buttons.
[26:27.330 --> 26:27.430]  Bye.
[26:29.130 --> 26:30.390]  Was that a triple kill?
[26:30.550 --> 26:31.050]  What happened there?
[26:31.050 --> 26:33.350]  I didn't get you, but I got everyone else.
[26:33.490 --> 26:34.210]  I got slammed.
[26:34.710 --> 26:35.790]  Yeah, but you didn't die.
[26:35.890 --> 26:36.210]  They died.
[26:36.310 --> 26:36.690]  You prick!
[26:36.850 --> 26:37.070]  No!
[26:38.330 --> 26:38.910]  Come here.
[26:40.410 --> 26:42.030]  Wow, how did you live?
[26:44.210 --> 26:44.610]  No!
[26:45.990 --> 26:46.970]  I shot you, Gavin.
[26:47.070 --> 26:47.570]  You saved you.
[26:48.170 --> 26:48.930]  Happy meal.
[26:51.750 --> 26:53.090]  Come on, piss Lambo.
[26:54.890 --> 26:55.830]  I'm big now, dad.
[26:55.830 --> 26:56.530]  He's big now!
[26:57.230 --> 26:58.010]  Daddy's dead now.
[26:58.170 --> 26:58.310]  Oh!
[27:00.710 --> 27:02.350]  Happy tastes good?
[27:02.810 --> 27:03.990]  What the fuck is that?
[27:04.190 --> 27:05.150]  That's Dairy Queen's slogan.
[27:06.750 --> 27:08.090]  That's what I like about Texas.
[27:08.250 --> 27:08.690]  That's a thing.
[27:09.890 --> 27:10.230]  Ugh.
[27:10.730 --> 27:11.770]  I can't believe I lived.
[27:13.730 --> 27:15.190]  Oh, it's Shrek.
[27:15.370 --> 27:16.290]  It's hell on earth!
[27:17.110 --> 27:18.570]  Shrek cum everywhere.
[27:20.250 --> 27:23.670]  So, outside of Texas, they say happy tastes good.
[27:23.990 --> 27:24.490]  Interesting.
[27:24.970 --> 27:26.530]  Yeah, it's a different...
[27:26.530 --> 27:28.590]  The Dairy Queen in Texas is different.
[27:28.670 --> 27:30.130]  They have a different menu and everything.
[27:31.670 --> 27:33.150]  That's what I like about Texas.
[27:33.370 --> 27:34.230]  Everything's about Texas.
[27:34.550 --> 27:38.630]  In a way, the Dairy Queen in Texas is so much worse than every other Dairy Queen, it's crazy.
[27:38.630 --> 27:39.430]  Texas road stop.
[27:39.850 --> 27:40.410]  It's crazy.
[27:44.390 --> 27:45.950]  Donkey the animal.
[27:47.330 --> 27:48.610]  Donkey the character.
[27:51.090 --> 27:52.570]  That's just for our benefit, I think.
[27:53.770 --> 27:54.650]  Please don't die.
[27:54.810 --> 27:55.090]  Die.
[27:55.090 --> 27:55.490]  Please don't die.
[27:55.810 --> 27:56.330]  Ah!
[27:56.510 --> 27:57.090]  Ugh!
[27:59.690 --> 28:00.290]  Okay.
[28:01.630 --> 28:02.730]  This is...
[28:02.730 --> 28:04.750]  Andrew's list is insane.
[28:05.410 --> 28:05.690]  What?
[28:05.970 --> 28:06.330]  Hey!
[28:06.450 --> 28:07.730]  The Rat's winning it, baby!
[28:09.330 --> 28:09.710]  Ruffled chips.
[28:09.710 --> 28:10.850]  Ruffled chips.
[28:11.010 --> 28:11.830]  What about ruffles?
[28:12.310 --> 28:12.730]  No, alright.
[28:12.870 --> 28:13.230]  Doesn't matter.
[28:13.450 --> 28:13.890]  Who cares?
[28:14.510 --> 28:17.730]  Chips, Lay's, Fritos, Cheetos, Doritos.
[28:18.110 --> 28:19.210]  You're blocking up my words.
[28:20.470 --> 28:23.750]  French onion, ranch, blue cheese.
[28:25.330 --> 28:25.770]  Ooh.
[28:26.190 --> 28:26.630]  Zest?
[28:26.970 --> 28:27.210]  Ooh.
[28:27.730 --> 28:27.970]  Miso?
[28:28.330 --> 28:28.530]  Ooh.
[28:29.330 --> 28:30.450]  Oh, we're doing this one.
[28:30.810 --> 28:31.630]  I'm a little hungry.
[28:31.850 --> 28:32.230]  There we go.
[28:35.440 --> 28:35.880]  Nope.
[28:36.400 --> 28:36.740]  Nope.
[28:37.200 --> 28:37.480]  Nope.
[28:38.100 --> 28:38.560]  Other way.
[28:39.000 --> 28:39.360]  Other way.
[28:39.400 --> 28:39.880]  There you go.
[28:40.080 --> 28:40.660]  Come on.
[28:40.780 --> 28:41.740]  You can crack the code on it, Nick.
[28:43.300 --> 28:43.740]  Well...
[28:43.740 --> 28:44.160]  Squinkles!
[28:45.460 --> 28:45.900]  Squinkles!
[28:46.620 --> 28:47.940]  Dude, people wish they knew about squinkles.
[28:48.160 --> 28:49.860]  I'm going to the grocery store tonight.
[28:50.420 --> 28:50.860]  Damn.
[28:52.040 --> 28:53.120]  I'm trying to squink out.
[28:53.780 --> 28:54.100]  Okay.
[28:55.720 --> 28:56.740]  Oh, yeah.
[28:56.800 --> 28:57.320]  How's your teeth?
[28:58.220 --> 28:58.480]  Good.
[28:58.560 --> 28:59.220]  I just got a teeth cleaning.
[28:59.420 --> 28:59.720]  They're fine.
[29:00.260 --> 29:00.640]  It was nothing.
[29:00.800 --> 29:02.440]  It was no, like, oh, I'm in pain.
[29:02.560 --> 29:03.740]  I got to get something looked at or anything.
[29:03.860 --> 29:04.140]  Don't worry.
[29:05.260 --> 29:06.460]  I'm going to take it nice and slow.
[29:07.560 --> 29:09.320]  So Andrew said he could...
[29:09.320 --> 29:10.260]  He said he could do...
[29:10.260 --> 29:11.540]  Oh, where did my cart go over there?
[29:11.760 --> 29:13.620]  He said he could do 20,000 things in a day.
[29:13.760 --> 29:16.600]  It's apparently a rate of about 300 things an hour.
[29:18.820 --> 29:20.360]  I'm trying to get a good list for you.
[29:20.540 --> 29:21.080]  I'm really thinking.
[29:21.900 --> 29:22.680]  You are.
[29:22.820 --> 29:24.000]  I can tell by the way you're doing it.
[29:24.060 --> 29:24.920]  You are really thinking.
[29:26.580 --> 29:29.220]  I don't know if that's for our benefit, but you're really doing it.
[29:34.040 --> 29:35.900]  Did you say 90s?
[29:36.240 --> 29:36.680]  Pinties.
[29:37.060 --> 29:37.560]  Oh, okay.
[29:38.440 --> 29:40.960]  I do like the idea of 90s chicken wings.
[29:41.220 --> 29:42.840]  Yeah, they're just different, dude.
[29:43.720 --> 29:44.920]  Old Pizza Hut.
[29:45.200 --> 29:45.380]  Yeah.
[29:47.740 --> 29:48.800]  Pizza Hut buffet.
[29:51.460 --> 29:52.780]  Oh, come on.
[29:52.900 --> 29:54.040]  Got him, got him, got him.
[29:54.300 --> 29:55.160]  Oh, Geoff lived.
[29:55.660 --> 29:58.260]  Geoff got covered in Shrek cum and now he's ready to go.
[29:59.200 --> 30:00.000]  Right down Shrek cum.
[30:01.200 --> 30:01.960]  I think that's already on there.
[30:02.380 --> 30:03.940]  Oh, is Shrek 2 cum on there?
[30:07.340 --> 30:07.780]  Disgusting.
[30:08.420 --> 30:10.240]  He just wrote down disgusting.
[30:12.600 --> 30:13.040]  No!
[30:13.700 --> 30:14.120]  Geoff.
[30:14.540 --> 30:15.440]  I know, it sucks.
[30:15.920 --> 30:16.640]  Yet, here we are.
[30:17.260 --> 30:18.240]  Nick is big now.
[30:18.700 --> 30:19.260]  He's a big boy.
[30:19.400 --> 30:19.840]  Big!
[30:21.080 --> 30:22.040]  Bully him right out of the way.
[30:22.240 --> 30:22.520]  Get him!
[30:27.340 --> 30:29.680]  The first beat you thought of, Pete Holmes.
[30:31.810 --> 30:33.320]  The McDonald's Monopoly game.
[30:35.820 --> 30:36.540]  Uncle Jerry?
[30:37.420 --> 30:38.160]  Damn it!
[30:39.260 --> 30:39.900]  Jerry Seinfeld?
[30:41.120 --> 30:42.020]  Uncle Leo?
[30:42.120 --> 30:42.820]  Seinfeld the show?
[30:45.500 --> 30:46.420]  Curb your enthusiasm?
[30:47.760 --> 30:48.700]  Michael Richards?
[30:49.280 --> 30:49.840]  Larry David.
[30:50.580 --> 30:51.720]  Stand-up routine?
[30:52.260 --> 30:52.940]  Oh.
[30:54.680 --> 30:56.020]  Oh, God.
[30:56.320 --> 30:57.400]  Take that, you bastard.
[30:57.920 --> 30:58.520]  Take that, idiot.
[30:59.560 --> 31:00.060]  No!
[31:00.300 --> 31:01.460]  We got nutsacked!
[31:02.020 --> 31:03.280]  I got teabagged!
[31:08.840 --> 31:10.840]  He's deep in Peters now.
[31:11.840 --> 31:13.120]  That's a weird sentence.
[31:16.460 --> 31:17.760]  Oh, no!
[31:17.760 --> 31:18.180]  No!
[31:18.560 --> 31:19.860]  Is Peter Stormare on that list?
[31:20.020 --> 31:21.240]  Is Peter Scolari on that list?
[31:21.260 --> 31:22.540]  Peter Parker.
[31:22.980 --> 31:23.960]  Peter Porker.
[31:26.200 --> 31:27.900]  Peter Pumpkin Eater.
[31:30.540 --> 31:32.180]  Oh, I almost made it.
[31:32.420 --> 31:32.960]  I died again.
[31:32.960 --> 31:33.540]  Peter Cottontail.
[31:34.080 --> 31:34.540]  Peter Piper?
[31:34.700 --> 31:35.140]  Wow!
[31:35.600 --> 31:36.480]  Peter Pumper.
[31:37.460 --> 31:38.460]  Pajamas Sam.
[31:39.700 --> 31:40.640]  Peter Bill.
[31:40.660 --> 31:41.560]  Peter's in pajamas.
[31:42.200 --> 31:43.260]  Oh, my God.
[31:46.760 --> 31:47.720]  How many...
[31:47.720 --> 31:48.980]  What do you think you'd be at right now?
[31:50.960 --> 31:51.440]  Rats!
[31:52.260 --> 31:53.440]  Aardvark Moon with Peter Gabriel.
[31:53.540 --> 31:54.200]  That's a good one.
[31:54.360 --> 31:54.440]  Yeah.
[31:57.160 --> 31:57.640]  Yay!
[31:58.340 --> 31:59.500]  Son of a bitch.

[32:11.180 --> 32:11.800]  Oh, Geoff!
[32:12.120 --> 32:13.760]  We got a face-off!
[32:13.960 --> 32:14.400]  Oh, Geoff!
[32:14.400 --> 32:15.920]  We got a face-off!
[32:16.000 --> 32:17.100]  All right, I'll have to pay attention.
[32:17.380 --> 32:18.220]  Oh, boy.
[32:18.340 --> 32:19.000]  Here we go.
[32:19.120 --> 32:20.540]  All right, Nick, don't nick it.
[32:23.040 --> 32:24.780]  Never mind, I'll do that.
[32:25.340 --> 32:25.580]  Okay.
[32:25.920 --> 32:26.980]  I can't believe you're still in.
[32:27.060 --> 32:27.800]  Oh, my God.
[32:29.300 --> 32:31.280]  You got saved by all my stuff.
[32:32.160 --> 32:32.680]  Geoff!
[32:33.220 --> 32:33.740]  Geoff!
[32:34.740 --> 32:35.260]  Fire!
[32:35.900 --> 32:36.540]  Geoff, fire!
[32:36.920 --> 32:37.560]  Hold your fire!
[32:37.880 --> 32:38.440]  Hold your...
[32:38.440 --> 32:38.720]  No!
[32:39.820 --> 32:40.340]  No!
[32:40.340 --> 32:40.540]  Geoff!
[32:43.240 --> 32:43.880]  Wow!
[32:44.800 --> 32:45.900]  Great job, Nick.
[32:45.960 --> 32:46.520]  That was awesome.
[32:47.520 --> 32:48.440]  Excellent match, Geoff.
[32:49.240 --> 32:50.340]  Oh, we know Chrysosaurus.
[32:50.780 --> 32:53.120]  10 gifted subs.
[32:53.120 --> 32:54.340]  Thank you so much.
[32:54.480 --> 32:54.800]  Wow.
[32:54.840 --> 32:55.160]  Thank you.
[32:56.880 --> 32:57.920]  That was good.
[32:58.600 --> 32:59.740]  I want the school bus ramp.
[33:00.060 --> 33:05.120]  You're watching four people play Makeway and one person writing 20,000 things down.
[33:05.520 --> 33:06.220]  I'll nail things.
[33:07.960 --> 33:09.100]  Somebody in the chat wrote,
[33:09.260 --> 33:12.000]  Dinklage the actor and Dinklage the unit of measurement.
[33:13.520 --> 33:14.460]  Dinklage the unit.
[33:16.300 --> 33:18.240]  Dude, I am unlocking so much stuff.
[33:18.400 --> 33:18.720]  This is...
[33:18.720 --> 33:19.600]  Oh, God.
[33:19.880 --> 33:20.840]  This is so bad.
[33:21.480 --> 33:23.220]  Oh, the next thing up is the Batmobile.
[33:25.340 --> 33:26.480]  Do you want me to turn...
[33:26.480 --> 33:29.060]  Okay, so I got chaos mode still, but do you want me to turn on shortcuts?
[33:29.440 --> 33:29.960]  Hell yeah.
[33:30.300 --> 33:30.860]  Yeah, why not?
[33:31.200 --> 33:31.420]  Okay.
[33:31.460 --> 33:32.680]  I'm going to be short and cutting.
[33:33.180 --> 33:33.440]  Yep.
[33:33.700 --> 33:34.460]  All right, here we go, baby.
[33:35.580 --> 33:37.360]  Jack Black, Jack White.
[33:42.800 --> 33:45.940]  Somebody said Andrew's basically a character in Subway Surfers right now.
[33:46.020 --> 33:46.520]  That's pretty funny.
[33:47.320 --> 33:48.580]  Oh, pretty much, yeah.
[33:48.720 --> 33:49.740]  Yeah, well, that's fair.
[33:51.100 --> 33:53.480]  Fuzzy Wingman raiding with two.
[33:53.980 --> 33:54.420]  Wow.
[33:54.860 --> 33:56.000]  Wow, thanks for the raid.
[33:56.020 --> 33:56.480]  Thanks, Fuzzy.
[33:57.320 --> 33:58.680]  Hello to the both of you.
[33:59.300 --> 34:01.100]  Well, one of them's Fuzzy Wingman.
[34:01.780 --> 34:02.740]  Maybe there's three then.
[34:02.740 --> 34:04.640]  Oh, he comes with the raid?
[34:05.120 --> 34:05.240]  Yeah.
[34:05.260 --> 34:05.720]  I don't know.
[34:05.860 --> 34:06.280]  Oh, that's awesome.
[34:07.900 --> 34:08.740]  Oh, that's going to be...
[34:11.400 --> 34:12.060]  Oh, boy.
[34:15.500 --> 34:16.320]  Oh, boy.
[34:16.840 --> 34:17.740]  Oh, boy.
[34:19.320 --> 34:19.760]  Shit.
[34:22.100 --> 34:22.540]  Yeah.
[34:23.020 --> 34:23.780]  What happened?
[34:24.080 --> 34:24.520]  Shortcut!
[34:24.740 --> 34:25.560]  Get it, Luke!
[34:25.780 --> 34:26.080]  No!
[34:27.380 --> 34:28.300]  Which way is it?
[34:28.720 --> 34:29.440]  I don't know.
[34:29.700 --> 34:30.160]  This way?
[34:30.800 --> 34:31.160]  No.
[34:31.160 --> 34:32.600]  I don't think so.
[34:32.600 --> 34:33.220]  Damn it.
[34:33.460 --> 34:36.820]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[34:37.280 --> 34:38.420]  No, you did it!
[34:40.840 --> 34:43.440]  I can't believe that shit.
[34:43.580 --> 34:44.180]  Crazy.
[34:44.820 --> 34:46.340]  Winning for dummies.
[34:47.400 --> 34:51.080]  How do I do that on purpose?

[35:24.720 --> 35:25.680]  I made it, though.
[35:25.700 --> 35:25.940]  How?
[35:26.480 --> 35:27.100]  I made it.
[35:27.140 --> 35:27.740]  No, you didn't.
[35:28.720 --> 35:30.480]  Oh, that was a great shot, you little son of a bitch.
[35:31.160 --> 35:31.540]  Oh, no.

[35:38.580 --> 35:39.460]  Am I big or an idiot?
[35:39.700 --> 35:40.240]  I'm an idiot.
[35:41.180 --> 35:41.380]  Damn!

[36:25.010 --> 36:25.870]  Oh, I didn't make it.
[36:26.610 --> 36:27.690]  Where was I?
[36:27.830 --> 36:29.310]  Did I even come back?
[36:29.310 --> 36:32.870]  That's up to you to answer, my man.
[36:32.870 --> 36:33.550]  Clip that, please.
[36:33.670 --> 36:34.390]  Clip that, please.
[36:37.570 --> 36:39.410]  I can't answer that for you.
[36:42.050 --> 36:45.010]  Oh, man.
[36:45.070 --> 36:46.150]  Did I even come?
[36:46.830 --> 36:48.130]  Did I even come?
[36:48.590 --> 36:51.990]  It was supposed to late, and then he thought about it and said back two seconds later.
[36:52.030 --> 36:52.670]  You know exactly what happened.
[36:54.330 --> 36:56.010]  Guys, stop fucking me.
[36:57.130 --> 37:00.270]  How am I supposed to know if I come?
[37:02.430 --> 37:03.150]  Ask Gavin.
[37:06.110 --> 37:07.050]  Bye-bye.
[37:08.190 --> 37:08.930]  No!
[37:13.690 --> 37:15.990]  Shut up. Don't look at me.

[39:55.680 --> 39:56.560]  I got subbed.
[39:57.640 --> 39:59.160]  Oh, I do not have a long time.
[40:02.360 --> 40:05.120]  This stream is going by so fast.
[40:05.280 --> 40:06.020]  I know.
[40:07.020 --> 40:07.300]  Ah!
[40:10.040 --> 40:11.060]  God, bitch.

[40:24.980 --> 40:26.260]  What the fuck?
[40:26.900 --> 40:27.560]  Not right nighty.
[40:27.740 --> 40:28.320]  Nighty.
[40:35.420 --> 40:37.400]  It's just a list of tropes.
[40:38.800 --> 40:39.540]  Wait!
[40:40.240 --> 40:40.940]  No!
[40:41.820 --> 40:43.180]  No, you killed me!

[40:51.260 --> 40:51.960]  That's me.
[40:52.900 --> 40:54.320]  This is a disgrace!
[40:54.900 --> 40:56.760]  I didn't think I got a single point there.
[40:58.240 --> 41:00.100]  I did pretty well that one.
[41:01.440 --> 41:03.100]  Nick is way up there.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.240]  Good God.
[41:07.020 --> 41:08.380]  How do you come back when you're in first?

[41:10.440 --> 41:11.280]  Somebody has...
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.080]  Nighty night said aggressively before knocking person out Batman.
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.160]  Is Yellow Turban Rebellion a thing that you learned from Dynasty Warriors Origins intro?
[41:20.580 --> 41:21.700]  Yeah, that's all.
[41:22.220 --> 41:24.640]  You beat them in the first mission of the game.
[41:24.980 --> 41:25.620]  Every game.
[41:26.300 --> 41:27.260]  You already got...
[41:27.260 --> 41:28.760]  You already wrote down Lu Bu.
[41:29.800 --> 41:31.360]  Yeah, I gotta swing it back in.
[41:31.940 --> 41:32.520]  Oh, man.
[41:34.340 --> 41:35.880]  Gavin doesn't know where to put this.
[41:36.480 --> 41:37.080]  Well, this...
[41:37.080 --> 41:38.800]  I don't want to put it on the skippable part.
[41:41.180 --> 41:42.160]  The ramp down.
[41:44.540 --> 41:46.560]  Damn this beginning bit.
[41:46.660 --> 41:48.020]  Oh, Nick made it.
[41:48.020 --> 41:48.500]  Wait.
[41:49.940 --> 41:51.340]  What happened to you?
[41:51.920 --> 41:55.660]  I guess it spawned you guys in and it just said I didn't make it.
[41:56.040 --> 41:56.580]  Weird.
[41:57.060 --> 41:58.060]  Spawned by me.
[42:01.320 --> 42:02.120]  Got him.
[42:05.160 --> 42:06.680]  Wow, that was close.
[42:07.560 --> 42:08.120]  Hi, Geoff.
[42:17.380 --> 42:17.760]  Bullied.

[42:29.520 --> 42:29.940]  Oh, he made it.
[42:30.280 --> 42:30.820]  I made it.
[42:30.980 --> 42:32.640]  You got hit with the sack and made it?
[42:33.100 --> 42:33.640]  I did.
[42:33.780 --> 42:35.240]  Wait, but how do you only have five seconds?
[42:35.320 --> 42:36.240]  You're not going to make it.
[42:37.420 --> 42:38.580]  He's gone full boost.
[42:38.640 --> 42:39.160]  What happened?
[42:40.060 --> 42:40.440]  No!
[42:42.840 --> 42:43.540]  I don't know.
[42:43.620 --> 42:45.200]  This game does some weird shit sometimes.
[42:45.300 --> 42:45.620]  Yep.
[42:45.900 --> 42:47.640]  Yeah, I thought I was dead, so I just stopped.
[42:49.880 --> 42:51.320]  Man, I hate being backwards.
[42:51.660 --> 42:52.000]  Oh, shit.
[42:55.060 --> 42:55.780]  The best.
[42:57.040 --> 42:58.460]  Well, time to go.
[42:59.580 --> 43:01.100]  Gavin, you got a long way to go.
[43:01.260 --> 43:02.120]  Oh, no you don't.
[43:05.700 --> 43:06.540]  You...
[43:06.540 --> 43:07.180]  Oh, no.
[43:07.820 --> 43:08.520]  You...
[43:09.640 --> 43:10.480]  Hello.
[43:11.920 --> 43:12.340]  No!
[43:12.720 --> 43:12.880]  Oh!

[43:20.100 --> 43:20.520]  CSA?
[43:21.320 --> 43:23.660]  CSI Las Vegas opening song.
[43:23.660 --> 43:24.000]  In Spanish?
[43:27.120 --> 43:29.220]  Geoff only knows it in Espanol.
[43:29.280 --> 43:30.200]  Oh, my God.
[43:32.900 --> 43:35.200]  Dude, I'm in a hard fourth place.
[43:37.380 --> 43:40.480]  Chaos mode with all this stuff is not my move.
[43:41.480 --> 43:42.960]  Ghostbaker5gifted, thank you.
[43:43.520 --> 43:45.540]  This is a hell of a stream.
[43:45.740 --> 43:46.400]  Chaos Emerald.
[43:47.080 --> 43:48.260]  Fourth and long.
[43:48.900 --> 43:50.420]  Did he write Chaos Emerald?
[43:50.500 --> 43:51.000]  He did.
[43:52.400 --> 43:53.120]  Did he write ring?
[43:53.440 --> 43:54.300]  Latin words.
[43:55.600 --> 43:58.740]  He wrote fourth and long Chaos Emerald freshly baked goods.

[44:10.240 --> 44:11.820]  Oh, no, you can't think about him.
[44:12.220 --> 44:12.760]  Oh, no.
[44:14.140 --> 44:16.000]  Andrew just Bye-Bye Man-ed us.
[44:16.540 --> 44:17.100]  Oh, quick rights.
[44:17.280 --> 44:17.600]  Smile.
[44:19.100 --> 44:21.480]  Carrie and Ma's question mark.
[44:21.760 --> 44:22.380]  Is that how you spell it?
[44:22.400 --> 44:23.020]  Is there an E?
[44:24.400 --> 44:25.160]  I think that's an E.
[44:25.640 --> 44:26.920]  Is that what we're worried about?
[44:26.980 --> 44:27.660]  Is the spelling?
[44:28.760 --> 44:31.400]  That's why I wasn't certain on the spelling on that one.
[44:31.420 --> 44:32.680]  Oh, Nick made it.
[44:32.780 --> 44:33.740]  Nick made it.
[44:36.460 --> 44:38.720]  Was that still me or new me?
[44:38.820 --> 44:39.960]  Yeah, that was still you.
[44:40.060 --> 44:40.600]  Bye, Gavin.
[44:43.880 --> 44:44.700]  What the hell?
[44:44.700 --> 44:45.560]  I just stopped.
[44:51.800 --> 44:53.440]  Get off my tips.
[44:53.760 --> 44:54.500]  Damn you.
[44:56.260 --> 44:56.740]  Rats.
[44:57.860 --> 44:59.980]  This is the comeback the rats needed, baby.
[44:59.980 --> 45:01.860]  No, the rats.
[45:02.440 --> 45:04.340]  It doesn't spawn me good no more.
[45:10.500 --> 45:13.240]  If not go straight, why come sideways?
[45:18.620 --> 45:20.700]  Exploding slow and sideways.
[45:22.360 --> 45:23.380]  Just take our time here.
[45:23.480 --> 45:24.980]  What's the goddamn game doing?
[45:25.780 --> 45:28.300]  Oh, you got squished.
[45:28.680 --> 45:29.960]  Oh, you guys got exploded.
[45:30.680 --> 45:31.980]  I just hammered myself.
[45:32.960 --> 45:34.680]  I died upside down.
[45:34.840 --> 45:35.420]  Who's doing it?
[45:36.680 --> 45:37.780]  Daddy's big now.
[45:38.040 --> 45:39.900]  Daddy's big now.
[45:44.000 --> 45:44.740]  That's right.
[45:45.680 --> 45:46.640]  Daddy's small.
[45:48.640 --> 45:49.120]  No.
[45:50.640 --> 45:52.360]  Oh, my God, Geoff.
[45:52.580 --> 45:53.400]  Just me then, huh?
[45:53.700 --> 45:55.500]  Dude, Andrew's getting weird.
[45:55.640 --> 45:56.880]  Andrew's in like a dark place.
[45:57.220 --> 45:57.900]  Oh, my God.
[45:58.740 --> 45:58.760]  Child abuse.
[45:58.760 --> 45:59.260]  Child abuse.
[45:59.320 --> 46:00.940]  I'm just reacting to what you guys are doing.
[46:00.940 --> 46:03.480]  Nick just yelled, you're beating me up, daddy.
[46:03.860 --> 46:05.840]  Is that what I said?
[46:06.020 --> 46:06.320]  Yeah.
[46:07.280 --> 46:08.340]  Why'd you say that?
[46:09.140 --> 46:11.560]  Eric beat the shit out of me while he was big.
[46:11.840 --> 46:12.940]  Oh, that sounded weird.
[46:14.340 --> 46:15.820]  All of those are you guys.
[46:16.160 --> 46:18.520]  We're talking about blowing sideways, diagonal sliding.
[46:19.060 --> 46:19.960]  Someone's getting hammered.
[46:19.980 --> 46:20.660]  Hammer bros.
[46:21.280 --> 46:22.820]  Gavin's flying upside down.
[46:23.460 --> 46:24.580]  Eric's yelling about getting big.
[46:25.100 --> 46:26.780]  You want to get Mr. Fantastic on there?
[46:27.460 --> 46:27.900]  Ooh.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.880]  I don't know if you've played him in Rivals yet, man.
[46:31.920 --> 46:32.460]  He's good.
[46:32.580 --> 46:33.260]  Mr. Fantastic.
[46:33.380 --> 46:34.880]  That's my guy.
[46:36.380 --> 46:38.320]  He's having a hard time topping child abuse.
[46:38.440 --> 46:38.840]  There you go.
[46:40.200 --> 46:40.800]  Oh, this is bad.
[46:42.340 --> 46:42.660]  Yep.
[46:43.520 --> 46:44.400]  That guy...
[46:44.400 --> 46:44.980]  Where the goddamn...
[46:45.600 --> 46:47.200]  Oh, we didn't make it.
[46:47.220 --> 46:48.100]  Go, Gavin, go.
[46:48.340 --> 46:48.540]  Yeah.
[46:50.400 --> 46:51.300]  Did I make it?
[46:51.400 --> 46:52.560]  I died instantly.
[46:54.480 --> 46:55.100]  Oh, Gavin.
[46:56.460 --> 46:57.740]  Still alive.
[46:57.740 --> 46:58.440]  Oh, Gavin.
[46:58.780 --> 47:00.480]  Go, Rats!
[47:01.020 --> 47:01.340]  Sausages!
[47:11.240 --> 47:12.460]  Scooby-Doo!
[47:12.900 --> 47:15.080]  Who played Lancelot in the King Arthur movie?
[47:16.660 --> 47:17.420]  Who did?
[47:17.980 --> 47:18.520]  I don't know.
[47:18.840 --> 47:19.200]  Who did?
[47:21.900 --> 47:23.440]  What's his name?
[47:23.540 --> 47:26.540]  He was also Mr. Fantastic.
[47:26.940 --> 47:28.040]  He was Mr. Fantastic, yeah.
[47:28.040 --> 47:30.520]  Sure as shit wasn't Mads Mikkelsen, though.
[47:30.660 --> 47:32.400]  No, he's a different guy.
[47:32.560 --> 47:33.800]  The British guy?
[47:34.900 --> 47:35.300]  Yeah.
[47:36.900 --> 47:38.980]  He was in a King Arthur movie?
[47:39.340 --> 47:40.060]  Yeah, with Clive Owen.
[47:40.940 --> 47:41.700]  Mads Mikkelsen.
[47:41.780 --> 47:43.980]  Clive Owen was in a King Arthur movie?
[47:44.720 --> 47:46.180]  Yeah, with Mads Mikkelsen.
[47:47.740 --> 47:49.500]  I don't remember this at all.
[47:49.500 --> 47:49.660]  Keira Knightley?
[47:50.560 --> 47:51.660]  Yeah, it was Keira Knightley.
[47:51.780 --> 47:53.340]  Yeah, Keira Knightley was in it.
[47:54.300 --> 47:54.900]  Thanks, Geoff.
[47:56.080 --> 47:57.180]  So was Mads Mikkelsen.
[47:58.040 --> 48:00.740]  And The Thing, and Sue Richards, and Johnny Storm.
[48:01.680 --> 48:03.280]  Who did Mads play in that?
[48:03.840 --> 48:04.500]  He was just like...
[48:04.500 --> 48:05.300]  He was Mr. Fantastic.
[48:06.240 --> 48:07.240]  Oh, what the fuck?
[48:08.040 --> 48:10.420]  What was the movie with Keira Knightley in some hole?
[48:11.140 --> 48:11.620]  Oh, shit.
[48:11.960 --> 48:13.860]  Oh, yeah. Pirates of the Caribbean.
[48:17.640 --> 48:18.560]  Oh, God.
[48:19.280 --> 48:21.100]  Made me laugh right into the Tesla coil.
[48:21.420 --> 48:23.840]  Oh, shit. Someone clipped, did I even come? Damn it.
[48:27.260 --> 48:30.680]  Oh, yeah. We should probably look at the clips that have been clipped from our streams, actually.
[48:30.840 --> 48:32.140]  Nah, we're good.
[48:34.260 --> 48:36.280]  Eh, just for... Where'd everybody go?
[48:39.940 --> 48:40.380]  Domino.
[48:42.540 --> 48:43.420]  Domino Harvey.
[48:44.780 --> 48:46.200]  Shit. I made it!
[48:46.660 --> 48:47.120]  Damn it.
[48:47.660 --> 48:52.120]  If you voted for me on this one, boys, I'm apologizing now. It's not good.
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.180]  I'll tell you what is good. That list of 20,000 things Andrew's working on.
[48:57.700 --> 48:58.500]  She's 75.
[48:59.100 --> 49:01.760]  Nick only needs 75 points.
[49:02.120 --> 49:04.740]  Come with me, and you'll see.
[49:06.720 --> 49:07.980]  I don't want to.
[49:09.380 --> 49:10.360]  What are you worried about?
[49:11.380 --> 49:12.440]  It's the way you said it.
[49:12.780 --> 49:13.420]  Yeah, no kidding.
[49:14.300 --> 49:14.440]  What?
[49:14.640 --> 49:15.420]  Real Wonka weirdo.
[49:15.840 --> 49:16.040]  Yeah.
[49:16.700 --> 49:17.820]  Or right Wonka weirdo.
[49:19.980 --> 49:21.040]  Did you drink the bubbles?
[49:21.360 --> 49:22.540]  Tim Burton. Close enough.
[49:27.770 --> 49:28.410]  Hmm.
[49:29.950 --> 49:33.130]  I want to do shortcuts again, but have more jumps.
[49:34.510 --> 49:34.750]  Damn!
[49:34.750 --> 49:37.410]  I want to not consistently fuck that part up.
[49:38.790 --> 49:39.750]  I made it.
[49:40.070 --> 49:42.730]  I was never...
[49:43.550 --> 49:44.970]  I wasn't...
[49:44.970 --> 49:47.730]  I'm stuck in the wall! It was trapping me in!
[49:49.410 --> 49:51.110]  Please don't leave me behind!
[49:51.430 --> 49:52.350]  Leave Nick behind!
[49:53.170 --> 49:53.450]  No!
[49:54.990 --> 49:56.010]  Go Rats!
[49:56.550 --> 49:57.370]  Ah!
[49:57.810 --> 49:58.350]  Oh.
[49:59.910 --> 50:03.370]  Win! Your greatest nemesis.
[50:04.170 --> 50:05.770]  Casper the mattress.
[50:06.430 --> 50:07.750]  Like it's a character.
[50:14.270 --> 50:15.790]  He's gonna get sacked.
[50:16.170 --> 50:17.170]  Oh my god.
[50:18.310 --> 50:19.910]  Hey, this is my Casper mattress.
[50:21.450 --> 50:22.250]  Damn!
[50:30.470 --> 50:30.790]  Ah!
[50:32.530 --> 50:32.830]  Yes.
[50:33.310 --> 50:33.970]  Way to go, idiot!
[50:35.190 --> 50:35.910]  Goo hole!
[50:36.250 --> 50:37.410]  Goo for you, dickweeds!
[50:37.550 --> 50:38.150]  I got squashed!
[50:38.350 --> 50:39.770]  Oh, the Tesla!
[50:43.490 --> 50:43.890]  Squishmallow.
[50:44.670 --> 50:46.210]  How did I spawn with goo?
[50:47.090 --> 50:47.910]  You got goo'd.
[50:49.390 --> 50:50.930]  I'm big now. Daddy's big now.
[50:51.090 --> 50:53.210]  Maybe you had one of those dreams you were telling me about.
[50:53.990 --> 50:56.570]  Did you figure out if you did or not?
[50:57.630 --> 50:58.450]  Oh, there it goes.
[50:58.570 --> 50:58.750]  Oh!
[51:06.870 --> 51:09.190]  I almost shot myself with goo.
[51:12.350 --> 51:13.870]  Maybe or maybe not.
[51:13.970 --> 51:14.590]  Clip it!
[51:14.950 --> 51:15.790]  Clip it!
[51:16.250 --> 51:16.950]  Clip it!
[51:17.190 --> 51:18.370]  I'm done saying words.
[51:19.010 --> 51:19.970]  How did I not get it?
[51:19.970 --> 51:21.830]  You shot yourself with goo.
[51:22.290 --> 51:25.250]  Well, I shot goo and then it spawned me under my own goo.
[51:27.250 --> 51:28.490]  Say it a few more ways.
[51:30.290 --> 51:31.690]  Tell us about your goo some more.
[51:31.730 --> 51:32.470]  Nick wins!
[51:32.510 --> 51:33.430]  Hello!
[51:34.890 --> 51:35.830]  Big win for Nick!
[51:36.510 --> 51:38.650]  Oh, joint second though. I'll take that.
[51:39.050 --> 51:39.930]  Oh my god.
[51:40.850 --> 51:42.110]  One more, boys!
[51:42.370 --> 51:43.090]  Let's do one more.
[51:43.650 --> 51:44.310]  Hell yeah.
[51:46.090 --> 51:47.670]  I'm unlocking so much stuff.
[51:48.190 --> 51:48.610]  Me too.
[51:50.110 --> 51:51.390]  How you holding up, Andrew?
[51:52.570 --> 51:53.570]  I'm tired.
[51:56.470 --> 52:01.450]  I've been sucking from the world, the forces in the air.
[52:01.930 --> 52:02.330]  What?
[52:02.810 --> 52:03.530]  You've been sucking from the world?
[52:03.570 --> 52:04.910]  You've been sucking from the world?
[52:04.910 --> 52:05.570]  I've been sucking from the world.
[52:05.690 --> 52:06.770]  I've been sucking from the inspiration.
[52:06.950 --> 52:07.710]  I'm getting tapped out.
[52:07.810 --> 52:08.450]  A little tapped out.
[52:08.610 --> 52:09.270]  A little exhausted.
[52:10.150 --> 52:11.290]  Getting all this inspiration.
[52:11.970 --> 52:15.070]  I think I could have written a thousand things in this amount of time.
[52:15.670 --> 52:16.650]  Andrew's sucked tapped.
[52:17.670 --> 52:18.430]  What's the number?
[52:18.710 --> 52:19.790]  What are you at right now?
[52:19.930 --> 52:20.330]  Two to eight.
[52:21.390 --> 52:22.030]  Oh my.
[52:22.470 --> 52:23.170]  Cat's hanging.
[52:23.710 --> 52:25.350]  Are we still doing the same thing?
[52:25.410 --> 52:26.370]  We doing chaos for shortcuts?
[52:26.370 --> 52:26.770]  I like it.
[52:27.190 --> 52:27.350]  Yeah.
[52:27.350 --> 52:27.930]  I love it!
[52:29.570 --> 52:30.110]  We're good.
[52:30.110 --> 52:30.910]  Ready?
[52:31.030 --> 52:31.490]  Hell yeah.
[52:31.550 --> 52:32.050]  Let's do it, boys!
[52:32.050 --> 52:34.490]  I want to try it on the Xbox someday like Gavin does.
[52:35.350 --> 52:36.490]  It's not helping me.
[52:36.890 --> 52:37.370]  Check it out.
[52:37.490 --> 52:38.490]  I'm Penelope Pitstop.
[52:39.990 --> 52:40.830]  I'm Batman.
[52:43.310 --> 52:44.490]  Mondo Posters.
[52:48.120 --> 52:49.180]  Mondo Torres.
[52:49.700 --> 52:50.320]  Mondo Gecko.
[52:53.720 --> 52:55.100]  Alright, let's see.
[52:56.300 --> 52:57.100]  We're going to go up.
[52:57.160 --> 52:58.300]  Oh, I see.
[52:58.300 --> 53:02.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:03.360 --> 53:04.660]  We got some ideas, boys.
[53:04.840 --> 53:05.680]  We got some ideas, boys.
[53:07.660 --> 53:08.440]  Oh my god!
[53:08.940 --> 53:09.720]  Oh my god!
[53:09.920 --> 53:11.100]  Oh, I'm going to get sick of them.
[53:14.980 --> 53:15.980]  What was that?
[53:16.020 --> 53:16.600]  Did I come back?
[53:20.400 --> 53:20.840]  Damn!
[53:21.320 --> 53:21.760]  Yes!
[53:25.470 --> 53:26.890]  Go Penelope Pitstop!
[53:30.830 --> 53:35.070]  Can you give me Muttly on there?
[53:35.310 --> 53:36.150]  Oh, that's a good one.
[53:36.750 --> 53:37.930]  Oh, Muttly's good.
[53:38.290 --> 53:39.050]  Wacky Races.
[53:39.290 --> 53:39.570]  Yeah.
[53:42.090 --> 53:42.590]  Big Racer.
[53:43.030 --> 53:43.810]  Let's go up.
[53:45.190 --> 53:45.790]  Let's go right.
[53:46.250 --> 53:46.550]  Left.
[53:47.030 --> 53:47.310]  Whatever.
[53:47.890 --> 53:48.430]  Write those down.
[53:49.590 --> 53:49.890]  Which way?
[53:52.050 --> 53:52.570]  What?
[53:52.750 --> 53:53.130]  Oh.
[53:53.810 --> 53:55.090]  What the fuck?
[53:55.490 --> 53:55.730]  Gavin.
[53:55.950 --> 53:56.450]  Is that...
[53:56.450 --> 53:56.870]  Oh.
[53:58.450 --> 53:58.950]  Chutney.
[54:00.610 --> 54:00.990]  Oh, Chutney.
[54:02.090 --> 54:04.330]  Oh, there's lots of different types of Chutney, Andrew.
[54:05.250 --> 54:05.750]  Cool.
[54:10.090 --> 54:11.870]  Wow, Nick, you're going to need to get fucked.
[54:12.290 --> 54:13.150]  I guess so.
[54:14.010 --> 54:14.510]  Cool.
[54:14.650 --> 54:15.790]  I'll just go to hell, I guess.
[54:17.070 --> 54:17.570]  Cool.
[54:18.510 --> 54:19.890]  Yeah, whatever, man.
[54:20.550 --> 54:20.950]  Okay.
[54:22.090 --> 54:22.970]  Sure, Dad.
[54:24.330 --> 54:25.270]  Daddy's big now.
[54:31.910 --> 54:32.930]  Fuck me.
[54:33.650 --> 54:34.370]  Fucking hell.
[54:35.070 --> 54:35.870]  Trampoline.
[54:37.310 --> 54:38.110]  Trampompoline.
[54:39.010 --> 54:40.370]  Making straight ass?
[54:41.870 --> 54:42.390]  Goodbye.
[54:44.010 --> 54:44.670]  I lived.
[54:45.090 --> 54:45.530]  Damn it.
[54:47.570 --> 54:48.510]  Oakland A.
[54:52.850 --> 54:55.130]  Oh, you could say a person and the team.
[54:55.490 --> 54:56.210]  A and A's.
[54:57.090 --> 54:58.150]  Don't listen to him, Andrew.
[54:59.630 --> 55:00.030]  Yeah.
[55:00.870 --> 55:01.270]  What?
[55:02.810 --> 55:03.210]  Yeah.
[55:03.410 --> 55:05.030]  Yeah, don't listen to me.
[55:07.250 --> 55:08.990]  Alright, we're getting sack swinging over here.
[55:09.550 --> 55:09.890]  Gavin.
[55:10.490 --> 55:11.510]  Oh, I didn't get a thing.
[55:12.590 --> 55:16.870]  I know, it's very unusual for you, but...
[55:16.870 --> 55:19.010]  Yeah, to build up instead of destroy.
[55:19.190 --> 55:20.470]  But yes, here we are.
[55:23.270 --> 55:23.890]  Oh, God.
[55:24.630 --> 55:25.390]  Ah, shit.
[55:25.550 --> 55:26.870]  That was a movie with George Burns.
[55:26.970 --> 55:27.750]  Oh, God, you devil.
[55:27.750 --> 55:28.690]  That's a thing.
[55:29.970 --> 55:31.170]  Oh, God, you devil.
[55:31.290 --> 55:31.590]  Oh, God.
[55:33.890 --> 55:34.450]  Fuck.
[55:34.830 --> 55:35.250]  The goo.
[55:35.670 --> 55:36.930]  Fuck, double fuck.
[55:38.470 --> 55:39.030]  Yes.
[55:39.470 --> 55:41.330]  What happened?
[55:42.030 --> 55:43.150]  Somebody got a shortcut.
[55:43.650 --> 55:43.850]  Me.
[55:46.110 --> 55:48.450]  He's been studying that for a while now.
[55:48.590 --> 55:49.330]  I've been trying it.
[55:51.910 --> 55:53.010]  You dickweed.
[55:53.070 --> 55:53.550]  No.
[55:55.810 --> 55:57.730]  Oh, God, you George Burns.
[56:02.170 --> 56:02.570]  Fuck.
[56:02.570 --> 56:03.530]  Can we do this every stream?
[56:04.010 --> 56:04.790]  I know.
[56:08.190 --> 56:08.770]  Ah, shit.
[56:09.350 --> 56:10.750]  I think Andrew would be sick.
[56:10.910 --> 56:12.570]  I don't think Andrew could do it every stream.
[56:12.930 --> 56:14.830]  I definitely need a little break.
[56:15.150 --> 56:17.170]  We'd get to our fucking book, though, wouldn't we?
[56:17.370 --> 56:17.770]  That'd be cool.
[56:18.810 --> 56:19.410]  Oh, God.
[56:19.750 --> 56:20.450]  Oh, Geoff.
[56:20.510 --> 56:20.790]  Wow.
[56:22.110 --> 56:22.970]  Geoff, you made it.
[56:23.050 --> 56:24.010]  That was the sequel.
[56:24.230 --> 56:24.650]  Oh, God.
[56:24.710 --> 56:25.210]  Oh, Geoff.
[56:25.950 --> 56:28.490]  The effects of one margarita.
[56:28.750 --> 56:30.630]  The effects of two margaritas.
[56:31.290 --> 56:32.420]  The effects of three margaritas.
[56:33.070 --> 56:33.330]  What?
[56:33.970 --> 56:34.550]  Political censorship.
[56:37.450 --> 56:38.870]  It's such a good list.
[56:40.770 --> 56:42.390]  I'm tired after this.
[56:42.950 --> 56:44.770]  I see why Andrew's exhausted.
[56:47.800 --> 56:49.620]  Oh, that one's gonna be insane.
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.380]  Oh, that's gonna be real good.
[56:51.400 --> 56:52.740]  Yeah, some of these pieces are crazy, man.
[56:52.980 --> 56:53.850]  Oh, Gavin.
[56:55.160 --> 56:55.860]  What's up?
[56:57.700 --> 56:59.100]  What's up?
[57:03.260 --> 57:05.020]  Oh, my God.
[57:05.520 --> 57:05.780]  Fuck.
[57:06.040 --> 57:08.000]  Alright, leave it to Penelope Pitstop.
[57:09.020 --> 57:10.200]  Just one time.
[57:10.860 --> 57:11.500]  There we go.
[57:12.740 --> 57:13.060]  Beep, beep.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.050]  Jesus Christ.
[57:16.400 --> 57:17.040]  Oh, you worthless dick.
[57:20.320 --> 57:21.940]  Wow, he did it again.
[57:22.380 --> 57:22.720]  Yeah.
[57:23.660 --> 57:24.360]  No.
[57:25.140 --> 57:25.620]  No.
[57:27.580 --> 57:28.760]  God damn it, it's at me.
[57:28.760 --> 57:29.720]  Yeah.
[57:30.560 --> 57:32.860]  That'll happen in a Tesla, you know what I'm saying?
[57:33.860 --> 57:34.400]  You what?
[57:38.340 --> 57:38.860]  Dipshit.
[57:38.960 --> 57:39.620]  That'll happen in a Tesla.
[57:42.660 --> 57:43.860]  Oh, I got bumped?
[57:43.940 --> 57:44.300]  What happened?
[57:44.560 --> 57:46.040]  Oh, I slapped myself.
[57:46.320 --> 57:46.660]  Hi, Geoff.
[57:47.060 --> 57:47.460]  Hi.
[57:56.710 --> 57:57.750]  Oh, wow.
[57:57.750 --> 58:00.630]  That rocket boost is crucial.
[58:01.610 --> 58:02.170]  Wow.
[58:03.890 --> 58:06.870]  Geoff just turned off the jets and left everything.
[58:06.890 --> 58:07.230]  Wow.
[58:07.230 --> 58:08.910]  I did the fucking nitrous.
[58:09.030 --> 58:09.750]  That was awesome.
[58:10.070 --> 58:13.790]  We are minutes away from the best time of the week.
[58:13.910 --> 58:14.270]  You.
[58:16.510 --> 58:21.290]  Oh, man.
[58:29.330 --> 58:30.250]  Come on.
[58:30.250 --> 58:31.490]  Get the fuck off me.
[58:31.490 --> 58:32.290]  No, Geoff.
[58:36.170 --> 58:37.630]  Gavin, you perv.
[58:37.710 --> 58:38.290]  Get off me.
[58:39.530 --> 58:41.330]  Big Bubba Chuggalug.
[58:43.910 --> 58:46.450]  Might be my new favorite name.
[58:49.210 --> 58:52.130]  It's just such a funny thing to hear you say.
[58:52.670 --> 58:54.430]  Big Bubba Chuggalug.
[58:54.430 --> 58:55.350]  Shut up.
[58:57.670 --> 59:00.750]  Make sure this doesn't happen again.
[59:04.290 --> 59:05.390]  Where's the front?
[59:05.670 --> 59:06.210]  Right there.
[59:08.310 --> 59:12.750]  I have to type my drinks from my fucking soda stream so I don't end up spitting it up.
[59:14.650 --> 59:16.230]  You pineapple pizza, back.
[59:19.190 --> 59:22.310]  Pineapple pizza didn't come out in the pineapple smoothie era.
[59:22.750 --> 59:23.270]  Nuh-uh.
[59:24.170 --> 59:25.530]  Stream of consciousness.
[59:26.850 --> 59:27.650]  Andrew's done.
[59:27.930 --> 59:28.530]  It's getting meta.
[59:30.970 --> 59:34.490]  So, based off what we have here, how long would it take to hit 20,000?
[59:34.590 --> 59:35.770]  Oh my god, we're never getting there.
[59:36.370 --> 59:38.310]  It's gonna be a few Friday streams, that's for sure.
[59:39.350 --> 59:40.190]  Oh, you done it.
[59:40.190 --> 59:40.910]  No, I had it.
[59:41.050 --> 59:41.770]  I forgot what it was.
[59:41.770 --> 59:42.490]  Oh, I had it.
[59:44.670 --> 59:45.470]  Cola soda.
[59:48.110 --> 59:50.030]  Well, there's cola flavors of other things.
[59:50.730 --> 59:52.070]  You don't know, Eric.
[59:52.650 --> 59:53.990]  What did you do?
[59:54.570 --> 59:55.290]  He went early.
[59:57.370 --> 59:58.230]  Wrong way.
[59:59.990 --> 01:00:02.250]  You always got slapped the right way.
[01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:07.810]  It is five o'clock, we are one minute away.
[01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.010]  I see everybody's doing that.
[01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:13.410]  Where's the front?
[01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.990]  Oh, they're going around now.
[01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:15.370]  Oh, I made it.
[01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.750]  Like hell you did.
[01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:21.050]  Dammit.
[01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.430]  No!
[01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:22.990]  Shrek come, Shrek come!
[01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.870]  No!
[01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.230]  Shrek!
[01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:25.890]  Whoops!
[01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:26.550]  Not that hot!
[01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.290]  Andrew, you ready for 5.01?
[01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:29.990]  Are you pumped?
[01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.550]  I'm ready!
[01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:32.830]  No!
[01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:34.590]  5.01's a thing.
[01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:35.130]  Team monetized.
[01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:36.790]  5.01!
[01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.690]  5.01!
[01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:42.410]  Andrew, 5.01, give it to us, put it on there.
[01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.830]  Put it on the list.
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:44.710]  Put 5.01 on the list.
[01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:49.070]  I think he just...
[01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:53.370]  He's so stupid.
[01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.370]  Uh oh.
[01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.910]  Yeah, you better uh oh.
[01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:00.530]  Daddy's big boy.
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:01.910]  Okay.
[01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:04.650]  Bye guys!
[01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:06.090]  You fucking took me out.
[01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:06.550]  Rats win.
[01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:08.490]  No, rats!
[01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:16.510]  Go rats!
[01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:18.050]  Uh oh.
[01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:19.490]  I got attacked!
[01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.490]  Oh, Gavin, you...
[01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:25.770]  Oh, you got it!
[01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:27.090]  That's the shortcut!
[01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.270]  Shit, Gavin.
[01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:28.670]  Yep.
[01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:29.690]  Did that work?
[01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.750]  It did.
[01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:32.130]  You finished.
[01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.570]  Hell yeah!
[01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:34.330]  Now you know if you came.
[01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:37.710]  In first.
[01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:45.290]  Childish.
[01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.090]  Oh yeah, right?
[01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:53.590]  Oh, there's Gavin.
[01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.490]  Back at the start.
[01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.830]  Oh man, this is really going to be an interesting one to watch on Tuesday.
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.910]  Oh.
[01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:02.330]  I don't think we can ever listen to what we're saying in it again.
[01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:04.030]  Oh god!
[01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:06.450]  Jesus, idiot.
[01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.550]  Just on your back like a turtle.
[01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:11.270]  Like an average turtle.
[01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.610]  Oh, he made it!
[01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:18.290]  No, he didn't!
[01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:19.810]  Yes, he knew it!
[01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:22.150]  Yes, he knoooow!
[01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:23.850]  Wow.
[01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:28.570]  Childhood innocence.
[01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:30.470]  No!
[01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.930]  Oh, goddammit.
[01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:35.450]  Wait, am I still alive or what?
[01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:38.050]  No! Bullshit! He fell!
[01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:39.930]  I think it was a lot.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.820]  What the?!
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.460]  Oh, he's so much lower!
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:51.420]  Well...
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.380]  Oh, I hammered the wall.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.940]  You went the wrong way!
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.300]  I went backwards.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.860]  Do you think Andrew is sitting there, like, with his eyes shut?
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.160]  Just trying to visualize the things coming in?
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.420]  Oh, that's only a word a minute at this point.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.380]  Shrek come!
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.540]  God, oh, you suck.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:20.780]  Yep.
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.380]  No!
[01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:27.230]  Oh my god!
[01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:28.210]  Oh, I went under it!
[01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:32.450]  How did the fr-
[01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:35.530]  Oh, the teaming!
[01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:38.630]  Come on!
[01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.150]  Oh, not fast enough.
[01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:41.710]  That was an ambitious attempt.
[01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.950]  Yeah, I got excited.
[01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.010]  That was at the widest gap.
[01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:45.910]  Netflix original.
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.830]  Oh my god.
[01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:53.530]  Hey, if you have a company and you want to sponsor the list of 20,000 things, we can put your-
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:54.410]  We'll put you on it.
[01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:55.990]  Your brand can be on there.
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.490]  Yep.
[01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.030]  Along with Netflix original.
[01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.710]  Bye, Geoff.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.120]  Oh, in it to win it.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.060]  Oh my god!
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.640]  Why did I do that?
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.160]  I've done it again!
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.480]  Sod!
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:24.280]  My paypal is andrewdouglaspanton at hotmail.com
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.700]  God, I hope that's right.
[01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:36.090]  Oh, man.
[01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.370]  Start listing what you'd buy with the money.
[01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.910]  What?
[01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:47.530]  You heard him.
[01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:50.390]  I want to go another hour and see what happens.
[01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.530]  We'll get eight more things.
[01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.830]  He'll shrivel up and die.
[01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:57.870]  Damn, I've got the freaking piece of track again.
[01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.010]  That's my stupid ass horn.
[01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:07.370]  Ah, hit the wall!
[01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.150]  I've been crushed every round.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.960]  That's the funniest thing I've ever seen!
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.300]  That's the funniest thing I've ever seen!
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.020]  I didn't look at all of it!
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.800]  Just up against nothing.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.100]  This game.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:39.300]  I don't understand how you did that.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.420]  Oh, I better stay away.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.100]  Oh, no!
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:42.680]  He's doing it again!
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.400]  Not me, bitch.
[01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:51.600]  What the fuck?
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.300]  I got nutsack big style slot.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.620]  Where did I go?
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:56.720]  I thought I jumped it.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.460]  I can't get him, Geoff.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.320]  Am I there?
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.620]  You got annihilated.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.580]  I got nutsacked.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.600]  Yeah, you did.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.100]  Get me there!
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.900]  I nailed it!
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.880]  I nailed it!
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.640]  Dude, shortcuts. How can you play without shortcuts ever again?
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.900]  Yeah, I don't think we can.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.060]  Oh, fuck.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.280]  No!
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.380]  No, how did I not know that?
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.340]  You just died.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.900]  I ceased to be because somebody got so far ahead off the map.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.240]  I think Andrew's done.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.440]  I mean, it's 5.07.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.480]  He was only contracted through 5.01.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.540]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.160]  I like that it's 3 o'clock for him, though.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.540]  It's 3 o'clock.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.240]  Hey, it's 5 o'clock somewhere.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.480]  All the people racing.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.280]  There's so much specimen.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.180]  Oh, God, the jizz is everywhere.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.860]  The juice is loose, baby!
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:20.980]  Too much juice.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.240]  Andrew, any more that you want to put on that list?
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.580]  There's no way to read that.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.880]  What a shortcut to a finish.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.740]  I needed that. I needed that desperately.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:50.540]  Dude, how are we all bunched up like this? This is insane.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.680]  It's a good map.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.820]  Does picking shit instead of track make the game longer?
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.540]  Probably, yeah.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:17.180]  Yeah, because we would be getting way more checkpoints and not having to redo the first part eight times.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.680]  Yeah, think about every time we die.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.220]  Yeah, that's all you.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.620]  Or every time I die, the band. You can write that down, Andrew.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.760]  Guys, got you!
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.160]  Nick mumbling. Write that down.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.680]  No, thanks!
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.040]  What's he no thanking?
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.460]  Every time I die, the band.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.540]  Yeah, just suggestions.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.360]  Nick, what are you doing?
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.560]  Jesus Christ, Nick.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.880]  Nick, take the shortcut. It's down there.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.400]  Almost did it by accident.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.020]  No!
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.180]  Oh, God.
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.000]  Oh, wait. Oh, damn. I think...
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.360]  Nick's still in it.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.960]  Okay. All right, Mickey Mouse ass-flicking.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.220]  No, Malcolm!
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.220]  Goddamn it.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.920]  Oh, wait. Hello. I'm still alive.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.640]  Dude, Nick might take first on this one. This is crazy.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.280]  I bet we could do a Nick-Mickey Mouse compilation.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.640]  Jesus Christ, immediately paying off.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.180]  Nicky Mouse.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:22.100]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:22.700]  Nicky Mouse.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:23.380]  Modest Mouse.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.180]  Dead Mouse.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.380]  Who's this purple prick?
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.120]  That's me.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:32.840]  That's Eric.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:33.980]  Hey, what's up?
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:36.880]  Now what?
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.680]  Now who's blaming who in a sausage talk, bitch?
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.160]  Yeah, you got blamed.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.120]  You did get blamed.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:49.140]  You got fucking the gauntlet thrown at you.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:49.380]  Yep.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.420]  Unjustifiably blamed.
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:52.400]  I had a time, too.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.520]  I'm letting you know I'm coming for you.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:59.680]  I felt like everything that I said in justification was correct,
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.120]  and you had no leg to stand on.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.280]  That being said, please...
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.200]  Is that video done? I'm sorry.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.300]  Oh, yeah. Actually, isn't that beautiful?
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:14.920]  Yeah, it's done.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:15.740]  Okay.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.960]  Ah, I got an attack!
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.220]  Ah, an attack!
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.740]  Andrew got to 330 things.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.760]  You killed me.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.220]  You did that and you killed me.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.400]  You didn't make it.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:32.920]  No, no, no!
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.800]  Wait, no, did I?
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.380]  Wait, I surely crossed it.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.240]  You didn't make it?
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.800]  No, surely I...
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.520]  No!
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.200]  You bonked your head on the fucking door walking in.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.600]  Oh, it did let me finish.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.140]  Wow.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.420]  Look how tight this is.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.620]  This is insane.
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:57.240]  Andrew, it's 511. Thoughts?
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:10:59.760]  What?
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:04.900]  Is he okay?
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.240]  Oh, I think I see some trouble brewing here.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.160]  Wow, this is going to be shortcut city.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.900]  Oh, God.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:16.060]  I bought my VCR from there in the 80s.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.860]  He didn't say shortcut city.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.260]  Oh, he's still in it.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.060]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:28.880]  He's big now.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.920]  Why did I start on the left?
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.460]  Oh, I'm still there.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.220]  Big moron.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.800]  Oh, all the blood went somewhere else, eh, Gavin?
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.000]  Geoff!
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.020]  That's me.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:48.980]  Wait!
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:49.980]  Wait!
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:52.900]  No!
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.160]  Oh, God, no!
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.580]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:11:59.760]  I'm big now.
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.280]  Daddy's big now.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.060]  Okay.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:03.800]  Oh, boy!
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.000]  Fuck.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:08.580]  Gavin!
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.580]  Oh, shit.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.960]  Gavin, please don't leave me.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:19.540]  No.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.200]  Leave him.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.180]  Leave his ass behind.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.480]  No, not the hammer.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.560]  Not the hammer!
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.060]  No!
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:26.920]  Dammit!
[01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.290]  Squish.
[01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:32.810]  Oh, damn.
[01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:35.090]  I know, I was waiting for the squishy squish.
[01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:36.450]  Oh, God!
[01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:38.190]  Oh, shortcut, shortcut, shortcut!
[01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:39.090]  Nope.
[01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:40.010]  Shortcuts!
[01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:41.910]  I went all the...
[01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:44.390]  He did it, but he didn't make it.
[01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:45.810]  Dick.
[01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:48.930]  Oh, I think I see...
[01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:49.430]  Okay, all right.
[01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:53.130]  Ah, Geronies!
[01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.010]  I made it!
[01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:58.690]  Oh, it's the wrong direction, I think.
[01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.070]  So, this way.
[01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:05.370]  I think Roki Sasaki signed with the Dodgers.
[01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:06.850]  Hell, yeah.
[01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:08.490]  Crazy.
[01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:10.150]  Congratulations, everybody.
[01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:14.110]  I mean, I think it was pretty obvious he was gonna.
[01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:15.410]  Was he gonna go to the Blue Jays?
[01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.850]  I thought so, too.
[01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:16.970]  I have so many friends who are like,
[01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:17.990]  Dude, he signed with the Padres.
[01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.730]  I'm like, you're...
[01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:20.230]  But you're out of your mind.
[01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:21.110]  No shot.
[01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:22.730]  Uh-oh, this might be over.
[01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:24.170]  Uh-oh.
[01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:25.350]  No.
[01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:26.490]  Get me there.
[01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:28.630]  Get me there.
[01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:30.810]  Oh, Gavin!
[01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:32.010]  Get a face-off!
[01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:34.050]  Oh, my God, we have a face-off!
[01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:35.110]  Oh!
[01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:35.930]  No!
[01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.790]  I did it!
[01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:37.030]  What?
[01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:40.430]  Alright, buddy.
[01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.810]  Congratulations.
[01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:41.630]  These are all the marbles!
[01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:42.750]  Marble time.
[01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.690]  Andrew, put marbles.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.090]  Alright, there you go.
[01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:47.590]  Thank you.
[01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.130]  Oh!
[01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:50.050]  What?
[01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:53.190]  Come on, everyone!
[01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:56.230]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:57.850]  What the...
[01:13:58.490 --> 01:14:00.350]  Goddamn shame thing I put!
[01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:04.690]  This has been a regulation stream.
[01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:06.630]  Make way for 20,000 things.
[01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.530]  Full shot glass piece of shit.
[01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:10.930]  Thank you, Andrew.
[01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.050]  Thank you, Geoff.
[01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:13.150]  Thank you, Gavin.
[01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.790]  Thank you, Nick.
[01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:14.990]  Thank you, everyone watching.
[01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:19.030]  Thank you for listing all of this.
[01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:21.170]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:21.990]  Watch this on Tuesday.
[01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.130]  Let us know what things you would add to Andrew's list.
[01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:25.390]  And we'll see you later.

[01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:31.130]  Alright, we'll see you guys later.
