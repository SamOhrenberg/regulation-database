[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  Are you guys ready for Mario Party March? It's coming!
[00:03.520 --> 00:05.480]  What is that? What is Mario Party March, Andrew?
[00:05.600 --> 00:06.060]  Yeah, I'm gonna explain.
[00:06.460 --> 00:12.660]  Mario Party March is an event where we are going to play a 30-turn game of Mario Party one day at a time.
[00:12.900 --> 00:17.580]  And we will be releasing it live as we do it on our Patreon.
[00:18.020 --> 00:21.000]  Which will be free. It's in the free tier. You just need a free membership.
[00:21.600 --> 00:27.000]  And you can watch each day as we progress through Mario Party March one turn a day.
[00:27.320 --> 00:28.640]  But what happens at the end?
[00:28.640 --> 00:30.520]  Yeah, we have so many questions.
[00:30.600 --> 00:31.600]  Somebody wins!
[00:32.040 --> 00:33.420]  Let's start with Gavin. No, let's not. No.
[00:33.580 --> 00:37.680]  At the end, we put all the videos together and we put it out on YouTube.
[00:38.080 --> 00:38.880]  That's what we're doing.
[00:40.120 --> 00:43.540]  But, me and Geoff also have questions. Geoff, do you want your question?
[00:43.860 --> 00:49.200]  Yeah, let me get this straight. So, we're gonna record and release one round a day.
[00:49.360 --> 00:56.440]  So, on March 2nd, round two comes out. March 17th, round 17 comes out.
[00:56.440 --> 00:59.460]  Free on Patreon as long as you have a membership. Is that correct?
[00:59.760 --> 01:00.880]  That's correct, Geoff.
[01:00.940 --> 01:03.680]  Okay. And that goes on for 30 days, you're saying.
[01:04.040 --> 01:05.180]  So, a round a day.
[01:05.560 --> 01:07.660]  30 straight days. One round per day.
[01:07.960 --> 01:11.100]  Andrew, what time do you have to wake up every morning for 30 days?
[01:12.000 --> 01:12.880]  Great question!
[01:13.180 --> 01:15.200]  How do we feel about that as a group?
[01:16.080 --> 01:17.460]  I feel fine about it.
[01:18.180 --> 01:21.700]  Nick has some issues. I'm gonna have one conflict you guys are gonna be mad at me about.
[01:21.800 --> 01:22.500]  But we'll work through it.
[01:22.500 --> 01:25.660]  Come on! You agreed to this!
[01:25.660 --> 01:28.260]  It is worked out-ish.
[01:29.460 --> 01:31.380]  Now, let me figure this out.
[01:31.480 --> 01:39.040]  Because, surely, the exciting part of the advent calendar was that everyone got something every day.
[01:39.360 --> 01:40.960]  And it was free for everyone.
[01:41.060 --> 01:41.960]  And what a fun gift.
[01:42.180 --> 01:44.280]  And we had the benefit of pre-recording.
[01:44.420 --> 01:46.360]  So, that way, there were no issues.
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.540]  Andrew, will we have the benefit of doing batched pre-recording of this?
[01:51.720 --> 01:54.080]  We're building the train as it moves.
[01:54.080 --> 01:56.680]  There will be no batched recording. It will be day by day.
[01:56.880 --> 01:58.980]  You will feel the pain that we're in.
[01:59.300 --> 02:03.120]  Both editorially, as well as within the game.
[02:03.680 --> 02:07.760]  As we just build continuous, constant hate.
[02:08.060 --> 02:09.300]  As well as paranoia.
[02:09.320 --> 02:11.680]  For what each other has planned.
[02:12.080 --> 02:13.160]  What items they have.
[02:13.420 --> 02:14.740]  What we're working towards.
[02:15.140 --> 02:17.980]  It's gonna be an absolute disaster.
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.020]  Rage-filled mess.
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.280]  You're worried about your mental health through this, I think.
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.780]  What's gonna happen to you on day 11 when Nick steals your two stars?
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.820]  He manages to steal two stars in one day.
[02:31.380 --> 02:34.640]  And then you have 24 hours before you can seek retribution.
[02:35.040 --> 02:37.580]  I think day 1, we're all showing up pretty good.
[02:37.680 --> 02:38.920]  Pretty happy. Fun group.
[02:39.340 --> 02:44.920]  By day 8, I predict I'm somewhere in the Michael Sheen apocalypse now mindset.
[02:46.160 --> 02:49.340]  Of just hating all of you tactically.
[02:50.020 --> 02:51.620]  And just, yeah.
[02:51.880 --> 02:53.200]  Not a pleasure to be around.
[02:53.200 --> 02:54.400]  Can I ask another question?
[02:54.500 --> 02:58.800]  Can we do, or should we do, a real quick round of Nostradamus predictions?
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.120]  I predict day 11, somebody steals a star from Gavin.
[03:02.180 --> 03:03.600]  I don't know who, it's not amazing to me.
[03:04.040 --> 03:06.660]  But day 11 is a bad day for Gavin.
[03:07.020 --> 03:08.280]  Show mercy, Gavin!
[03:08.380 --> 03:12.340]  Okay, so my Nostradamus pick is day 18.
[03:13.200 --> 03:15.700]  Nobody is happy to be doing this.
[03:17.120 --> 03:19.780]  Everyone's upset with everyone else playing this game.
[03:19.960 --> 03:21.740]  You think that's gonna be three weeks in?
[03:21.740 --> 03:25.420]  Yeah, I think it's, because I think everything's gonna bubble underneath.
[03:25.760 --> 03:29.100]  And then it's day 18, it's all gonna come to a head.
[03:29.200 --> 03:31.580]  And it's going to be, I think there's gonna be arguments.
[03:31.820 --> 03:32.560]  Try day 8.
[03:33.020 --> 03:34.980]  Wow, day 8!
[03:35.500 --> 03:39.180]  My Nostradamus prediction is somebody in the Mario kingdom is gonna get divorced.
[03:39.700 --> 03:40.420]  Don't know who.
[03:41.060 --> 03:42.300]  Could be a Koopa.
[03:43.200 --> 03:44.140]  Could be a Boo.
[03:45.080 --> 03:48.120]  Oh, you should see the rates in the Mario kingdom, it is crazy.
[03:48.880 --> 03:53.820]  Who knew that we invented a fruit demon and a relationship demon in the same year?
[03:58.940 --> 04:00.780]  What can't you imagine?
[04:01.140 --> 04:02.840]  Finish your thought!
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.220]  Have we ever talked over ourselves this much in the history of this podcast?
[04:07.660 --> 04:09.500]  I don't think anyone talked over anyone except Nick.
[04:09.860 --> 04:11.820]  Nick and Gavin, one of you just talked.
[04:13.360 --> 04:14.500]  Great guys, thanks.
[04:14.720 --> 04:17.100]  So we're gonna play Mario Party.
[04:17.100 --> 04:19.260]  We're gonna do it one day at a time.
[04:19.340 --> 04:21.700]  Then at the end, we'll release the whole thing on YouTube.
[04:22.240 --> 04:23.280]  It's gonna be great.
[04:23.700 --> 04:26.580]  If you wanna watch it as it happens, go to Patreon for free.
[04:26.680 --> 04:28.100]  You just gotta sign up for a free account.
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.120]  If you're lazy and wanna wait till the end, it'll be on YouTube eventually.
[04:32.160 --> 04:34.720]  Go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[04:34.820 --> 04:35.800]  No one said the URL.
[04:36.040 --> 04:37.800]  Everyone just keeps saying go to Patreon.
[04:38.200 --> 04:38.960]  Well, you just did.
[04:39.160 --> 04:39.960]  Good job, Eric.
[04:40.540 --> 04:41.420]  Real team effort.
[04:41.580 --> 04:42.460]  Everyone did a great job.
[04:43.000 --> 04:43.880]  Gavin, take us out.
[04:44.260 --> 04:46.040]  Gavin, what were you gonna say and then take us out?
[04:48.340 --> 04:49.780]  What was I gonna say?
[04:50.080 --> 04:51.180]  Nick never made a prediction.
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.240]  I'm annoyed at day zero. We're not even started yet. I'm annoyed.
[04:56.140 --> 04:58.740]  On day 30, Andrew's gonna get some bullshit that makes him win the game.
[04:59.020 --> 04:59.220]  Yes!
[04:59.760 --> 04:59.800]  Whoa!
[05:00.780 --> 05:01.400]  I like that!
[05:02.120 --> 05:03.640]  What do you think the bonus stars will be?
[05:03.800 --> 05:06.600]  Is there more bonus stars because it's a longer amount of turns?
[05:07.560 --> 05:08.420]  How does it work?
[05:08.600 --> 05:09.460]  I don't think so.
[05:09.460 --> 05:12.420]  I think the bonus stars are gonna be so much more important than any other game.
[05:12.420 --> 05:17.300]  I'll say this, if one of the bonus stars is longest moment of silence, we're all screwed.
[05:18.200 --> 05:18.960]  You got this, Gavin.
[05:20.580 --> 05:26.840]  How can five people put silence on one person? How does that make any sense?
[05:27.360 --> 05:29.100]  Five people were silent, you idiot!
[05:29.620 --> 05:30.640]  Yeah, but who broke the silence?
[05:32.060 --> 05:33.720]  Wait, it was for breaking the silence?
[05:34.400 --> 05:34.820]  Okay.
[05:35.480 --> 05:41.780]  Alright, patreon.com slash the regulation pod, we'll see you there, starting on the first.
[05:41.920 --> 05:42.380]  Bye!
