[00:00.000 --> 00:02.180]  Santa wasn't built for Gavin's big balls.
[00:02.440 --> 00:05.600]  Hey, if Andrew's taking care of that and everything, do you guys want to jump in to some Mario Party?
[00:06.420 --> 00:07.840]  I'm in the game, yeah, I'm ready.
[00:08.200 --> 00:09.140]  Andrew's taking care of everything.
[00:10.340 --> 00:11.960]  Nick looked at me like he wasn't sure.
[00:12.740 --> 00:14.740]  Maybe we should put it live as soon as we're done with Mario Party.
[00:17.180 --> 00:17.500]  Okay.
[00:19.620 --> 00:21.280]  I want to do whatever it is you want to do, Gavin.
[00:22.820 --> 00:25.600]  Posh Gnome. Love it. Love you. Thank you.
[00:25.900 --> 00:26.840]  Go ahead and kick over to the game.
[00:29.200 --> 00:29.640]  Great.
[00:29.960 --> 00:30.840]  Oh, damn.
[00:31.160 --> 00:33.340]  Emily just texted, oh my god, the tension.
[00:35.440 --> 00:36.600]  I've lost my Joy-Con.
[00:37.700 --> 00:38.240]  That's fine.
[00:38.680 --> 00:39.540]  How will you have joy?
[00:40.700 --> 00:41.920]  There you go, bud.
[00:43.820 --> 00:44.260]  Phenomenal.
[00:45.500 --> 00:47.480]  Guys, welcome to the stream.
[00:47.640 --> 00:48.560]  Welcome to Mario Party.
[00:48.760 --> 00:49.500]  Welcome to the game.
[00:51.380 --> 00:52.820]  This is my cuckstool.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.020]  I'm going to watch the action from the side.
[00:55.400 --> 00:56.260]  Just keep an eye.
[00:56.260 --> 00:57.780]  Make sure everything goes well.
[00:58.520 --> 01:00.340]  Got everything locked and loaded.
[01:02.020 --> 01:03.840]  So, I think we're locked in.
[01:04.320 --> 01:05.420]  I think we're ready to go.
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.600]  And I think it's time for...
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.640]  There you go.
[01:10.360 --> 01:12.260]  A little bit of Mario Party 2v2.
[01:12.420 --> 01:13.680]  Let's get in these teams.
[01:14.320 --> 01:15.340]  Teams, teams, teams, teams.
[01:15.720 --> 01:18.300]  Whoa, somebody guessed that Nick's name was Millfunner.
[01:18.380 --> 01:19.060]  That's crazy.
[01:19.900 --> 01:21.820]  Who let the rats out? Why would you think that?
[01:23.040 --> 01:24.780]  What a crazy name.
[01:24.780 --> 01:25.660]  That doesn't add up.
[01:26.480 --> 01:29.240]  Less than 10 minutes and the Gerplers go on sale with everything else.
[01:29.380 --> 01:31.060]  The Cosmic Koozler? Can't wait.
[01:31.940 --> 01:33.180]  I'm going to kooz so hard.
[01:35.120 --> 01:36.240]  I've been saying that about you.
[01:38.300 --> 01:38.900]  Look at this.
[01:38.960 --> 01:40.020]  Let's invite everyone to the stage.
[01:40.800 --> 01:42.100]  Get me on there.
[01:42.480 --> 01:44.040]  Andrew, who are you going to be?
[01:46.240 --> 01:47.840]  Guys, thanks for all the subs today.
[01:47.960 --> 01:48.720]  Yeah, it's a good day.
[01:49.140 --> 01:50.300]  Yeah, this is insane.
[01:50.440 --> 01:52.200]  It's an awesome day for streaming.
[01:52.200 --> 01:53.240]  Sorry about all the fighting.
[01:54.660 --> 01:56.500]  No fighting. You guys are going to get a video.
[01:58.140 --> 01:59.180]  It's going to be up any minute.
[02:00.280 --> 02:01.580]  Yeah, but don't put it live yet.
[02:01.980 --> 02:02.340]  Processing.
[02:05.320 --> 02:06.740]  Does it have to be like this
[02:06.740 --> 02:08.120]  and the Gerpler
[02:08.120 --> 02:09.460]  and the video at the same time?
[02:09.540 --> 02:10.440]  Yeah, he's not being pushy.
[02:10.680 --> 02:11.840]  Why did they get up?
[02:13.100 --> 02:14.500]  We didn't know Andrew was up.
[02:14.880 --> 02:17.860]  Right, but we're still not putting it out yet.
[02:18.580 --> 02:20.320]  Oh, it's coming out.
[02:22.340 --> 02:23.140]  Andrew's in control.
[02:23.380 --> 02:24.380]  I'm all in on
[02:25.280 --> 02:26.040]  Andrew here.
[02:26.340 --> 02:27.980]  Well, I wouldn't put it live over the
[02:28.440 --> 02:29.140]  Gerpler release.
[02:30.000 --> 02:30.840]  Well, here's Wario.
[02:34.680 --> 02:35.740]  What was that?
[02:36.180 --> 02:38.020]  That was weird. I think that was the game.
[02:38.140 --> 02:39.140]  I don't think that was the stream.
[02:40.880 --> 02:41.520]  Mario Party?
[02:41.700 --> 02:44.100]  I thought it was like the 2v2 thing.
[02:44.400 --> 02:45.220]  It is. It's going to be.
[02:45.720 --> 02:46.060]  Is it?
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.120]  That's after this, I think.
[02:47.480 --> 02:50.300]  It'll be when we get to the...
[02:52.500 --> 02:52.940]  What?
[02:54.040 --> 02:54.620]  Are you okay?
[02:54.680 --> 02:57.360]  That was the transition into the door sound.
[02:58.260 --> 02:59.280]  That's the Mario sound.
[02:59.420 --> 03:00.220]  I scared the shit out of me.
[03:01.260 --> 03:03.660]  At first I thought you sneezed.
[03:03.900 --> 03:05.620]  I wish that was my scene.
[03:05.820 --> 03:06.360]  Tag team!
[03:07.100 --> 03:08.580]  Tag team back again.
[03:09.660 --> 03:10.660]  Tag team rules.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.580]  It's Geoff spelled G-O-E-F-F.
[03:15.160 --> 03:15.640]  What?
[03:21.100 --> 03:23.960]  Did you set the teams or no?
[03:25.700 --> 03:26.860]  That comes after, I think.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.100]  It's so delayed.
[03:28.380 --> 03:28.580]  Is it?
[03:31.120 --> 03:33.280]  We're watching it native.
[03:33.980 --> 03:35.920]  Every time I press something, it freezes.
[03:36.280 --> 03:36.760]  Oh, I see.
[03:37.100 --> 03:38.620]  It's probably because somebody is uploading a video.
[03:39.180 --> 03:40.380]  On both sides.
[03:44.300 --> 03:46.720]  Okay, so the teams should be...
[03:46.720 --> 03:49.540]  Dilkong and Mario.
[03:50.520 --> 03:52.520]  Against Wario and Monty Paul.
[03:52.740 --> 03:56.060]  So it's Team G against Team No Bad Ideas.
[03:56.280 --> 03:56.420]  Yes!
[03:56.420 --> 03:57.180]  Team G.
[03:57.340 --> 03:59.580]  We are going to destroy them.
[03:59.580 --> 04:00.840]  You've heard of Team G before?
[04:01.140 --> 04:03.280]  Yeah, that name is crazy.
[04:04.080 --> 04:06.920]  Shout out to the 15th anniversary of Team G.
[04:09.600 --> 04:10.600]  What's up, Team G?
[04:10.600 --> 04:12.120]  How many turns do you guys want to do?
[04:12.500 --> 04:12.580]  10?
[04:13.540 --> 04:14.780]  10 is good.
[04:16.280 --> 04:18.520]  I like it. Here I go, says Toad.
[04:18.800 --> 04:19.840]  Oh my Morgz!
[04:20.260 --> 04:22.360]  Morgz is coming through, dude.
[04:22.480 --> 04:23.980]  Thank you so much.
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.060]  Two rounds of 30?
[04:25.160 --> 04:26.080]  10 or 15?
[04:28.080 --> 04:29.660]  I don't give a fuck.
[04:29.920 --> 04:30.760]  I've pressed down.
[04:31.800 --> 04:33.200]  Wow, that's brutal.
[04:35.940 --> 04:38.180]  This is not through our thing.
[04:38.180 --> 04:39.320]  No, no, this is...
[04:39.320 --> 04:42.220]  Again, we're native here, so you're seeing the actual game.
[04:42.280 --> 04:44.880]  I wonder if it's just talking with Andrew?
[04:45.080 --> 04:46.720]  Dude, we've got a level 20 piss train.
[04:49.200 --> 04:50.780]  So this has the...
[04:50.780 --> 04:51.020]  Whoa!
[04:52.600 --> 04:54.140]  Send some s'more subs.
[04:56.180 --> 04:57.140]  S'more 90956.
[04:58.940 --> 05:00.100]  Staffcat23, thanks for the fight.
[05:00.380 --> 05:00.680]  Appreciate ya.
[05:01.100 --> 05:04.120]  Also, this piss train will not stop.
[05:04.860 --> 05:07.340]  When all this stuff goes live in about 5 minutes,
[05:07.340 --> 05:09.840]  the store site, like the front page, will also be updated.
[05:11.140 --> 05:11.940]  It's real nice.
[05:12.520 --> 05:13.540]  It's so cool.
[05:13.920 --> 05:17.140]  Shout out to the team at El Famoso for putting it together.
[05:17.160 --> 05:18.140]  Our friends at El Famoso.
[05:18.320 --> 05:19.480]  By hand.
[05:21.240 --> 05:22.280]  It's so cool.
[05:22.760 --> 05:23.440]  You'll understand.
[05:25.580 --> 05:26.880]  We do have 10,000...
[05:26.880 --> 05:28.600]  There are 10,000 Gerplers, by the way.
[05:28.680 --> 05:30.920]  I hope they charge us a lot for it, because it's good.
[05:31.340 --> 05:31.800]  It's pretty good.
[05:32.400 --> 05:33.100]  New map?
[05:33.100 --> 05:33.960]  Yes.
[05:34.340 --> 05:36.760]  I think this is from the first game.
[05:37.020 --> 05:37.400]  Is it really?
[05:37.580 --> 05:39.260]  I think so.
[05:40.260 --> 05:40.740]  N64?
[05:46.490 --> 05:47.650]  Let's do this, Nick!
[05:47.770 --> 05:49.130]  I love when a plan comes together.
[05:49.390 --> 05:49.850]  Geoff's in a mood.
[05:49.870 --> 05:50.930]  Geoff, we're on the same team now.
[05:53.230 --> 05:54.810]  Nope, nope, nope.
[05:54.850 --> 05:55.590]  There you go.
[05:56.250 --> 05:57.750]  We don't need information.
[06:00.150 --> 06:01.230]  Be nice to Gavin.
[06:02.570 --> 06:03.090]  Yeah!
[06:03.650 --> 06:04.170]  Oh!
[06:05.910 --> 06:08.690]  Your years of training are working against you.
[06:10.010 --> 06:13.890]  Oh, the domination begins!
[06:14.050 --> 06:14.790]  Let it be.
[06:15.210 --> 06:17.150]  Gavin, Plan G was only 13 years ago.
[06:17.230 --> 06:18.170]  Yeah, as far as you know.
[06:18.950 --> 06:20.870]  We were playing G in secret.
[06:21.590 --> 06:21.910]  That's true.
[06:23.730 --> 06:25.430]  As of this month,
[06:25.670 --> 06:27.410]  I've known Geoff for 20 years.
[06:27.550 --> 06:28.070]  Wow!
[06:28.770 --> 06:29.490]  That's crazy.
[06:29.630 --> 06:31.590]  What a weird thing for you to remember and categorize.
[06:31.710 --> 06:32.650]  I met you in August, I think.
[06:32.970 --> 06:34.370]  What a weird thing for you to remember.
[06:34.930 --> 06:35.530]  Geoff's raccoon!
[06:36.930 --> 06:40.090]  Hey, thanks to my raccoon
[06:40.090 --> 06:42.450]  for killing a fucking pigeon in my front yard the other day.
[06:42.550 --> 06:42.650]  Nice!
[06:42.870 --> 06:45.250]  I didn't mention it in the podcast, but there's been another Geoff.
[06:46.310 --> 06:47.030]  Didn't get to it.
[06:47.070 --> 06:47.550]  Does Jack know?
[06:52.890 --> 06:53.950]  That's where the star is.
[06:54.390 --> 06:55.090]  Wow, right there?
[06:55.090 --> 06:55.730]  It's the star!
[06:56.170 --> 06:58.510]  Yeah, it never moves if it's like the N64 one.
[06:58.630 --> 07:00.950]  But I think sometimes it will switch to a bad star.
[07:01.210 --> 07:04.030]  Yeah, every time it rotates between Toad and Bowser.
[07:05.090 --> 07:06.430]  What's a bad star?
[07:06.850 --> 07:07.910]  Just shitty Bowsers.
[07:08.150 --> 07:09.210]  It doesn't count.
[07:09.670 --> 07:11.610]  Somebody made a post on the subreddit.
[07:11.770 --> 07:12.530]  Where to buy a Gerpler?
[07:12.850 --> 07:16.570]  I feel like I'm missing something obvious, but why is it so difficult to find where to buy these?
[07:16.950 --> 07:17.170]  Edit.
[07:17.630 --> 07:19.310]  Regulationstore.com is the correct website.
[07:19.590 --> 07:23.150]  The site is blocked at the Atlanta airport Wi-Fi for some reason.
[07:24.590 --> 07:25.070]  The site is blocked at the Atlanta airport Wi-Fi for some reason.
[07:26.150 --> 07:27.610]  Fuckin' Atlanta airport.
[07:30.770 --> 07:31.870]  What you buying, Nick?
[07:32.230 --> 07:34.250]  I'm gonna get myself some dice.
[07:35.250 --> 07:37.470]  Oh, remember, you guys share a wallet.
[07:37.850 --> 07:38.250]  Oh, we do?
[07:38.570 --> 07:39.670]  I don't think so.
[07:39.990 --> 07:43.550]  I think we do. Look, Andrew, I only have ten. You don't.
[07:43.610 --> 07:44.550]  Yeah, because he has no money.
[07:44.690 --> 07:46.510]  Watch, because now when he goes again,
[07:47.050 --> 07:48.770]  I'm sure he lands and gets three or whatever.
[07:48.770 --> 07:50.770]  You should have eight coins, I would think.
[07:50.850 --> 07:52.210]  Geoff, we've never shared a bank account.
[07:52.210 --> 07:54.430]  Not to my knowledge. Well, we do for the company.
[07:54.490 --> 07:55.190]  Yeah, that's true.
[07:55.310 --> 07:55.790]  Oh.
[07:58.990 --> 08:00.370]  A little wrinkle.
[08:00.610 --> 08:01.230]  A little complication.
[08:02.530 --> 08:04.770]  The site is also ad-blocked.
[08:04.890 --> 08:06.410]  It's also blocked on every
[08:06.410 --> 08:07.970]  UK university campus.
[08:08.230 --> 08:08.870]  You got this, Geoff.
[08:09.110 --> 08:10.550]  Even the store one?
[08:11.270 --> 08:12.010]  Oh, shit.
[08:14.230 --> 08:15.770]  Oh, you got an item.
[08:16.490 --> 08:16.950]  What are you getting?
[08:17.370 --> 08:19.370]  Oh, Fight Club.
[08:19.370 --> 08:21.230]  Oh, item in the game.
[08:21.550 --> 08:23.190]  Fight Club. Two minutes.
[08:23.810 --> 08:24.850]  Two minutes, boys.
[08:26.370 --> 08:27.450]  Video's almost done.
[08:29.330 --> 08:30.910]  Video's almost done also? That's awesome.
[08:31.570 --> 08:32.310]  Yeah, double drop.
[08:33.810 --> 08:35.250]  Oh, nice double drop.
[08:35.430 --> 08:36.310]  That didn't even cost you anything.
[08:36.570 --> 08:37.470]  That was a great drop.
[08:40.190 --> 08:40.550]  Well done.
[08:42.370 --> 08:43.170]  You got an item.
[08:43.670 --> 08:45.150]  He got an item. How's the delay feel?
[08:45.330 --> 08:47.170]  Is there anything or no? It seems to be fine now.
[08:47.170 --> 08:47.770]  It's just the menu.
[08:48.210 --> 08:51.070]  I wonder if that's just like an update problem.
[08:51.190 --> 08:51.930]  How long till GURP?
[08:52.510 --> 08:52.970]  One minute.
[08:55.330 --> 08:57.730]  I'm waiting for the chat to stop dead.
[08:57.970 --> 08:59.050]  And then sudden...
[08:59.050 --> 08:59.810]  Oh, Santa.
[09:01.170 --> 09:02.830]  Thank you for the subs.
[09:03.630 --> 09:04.490]  Maybe save it.
[09:04.530 --> 09:06.370]  Sorry Gavin, I ruined your pants that one year.
[09:07.930 --> 09:08.870]  Thanks for the pants.
[09:09.350 --> 09:10.350]  Thanks, Harmon Mango.
[09:10.650 --> 09:13.290]  We got about 30 seconds,
[09:13.450 --> 09:14.510]  I believe, until they're live.
[09:14.970 --> 09:17.130]  But then also give it a little bit of leeway.
[09:17.310 --> 09:18.190]  Oh, and the site.
[09:18.330 --> 09:19.590]  The site just kicked to the update.
[09:20.970 --> 09:22.290]  The site just kicked to the update.
[09:22.790 --> 09:24.510]  If you hit refresh...
[09:25.770 --> 09:27.070]  If you refresh, you can check that out.
[09:27.150 --> 09:28.930]  That's done by hand by Zach and the team.
[09:29.090 --> 09:30.610]  Eric is a big dog. I agree.
[09:32.470 --> 09:33.190]  Velvet foreskin.
[09:33.410 --> 09:33.650]  Thank you.
[09:34.750 --> 09:35.690]  I appreciate it.
[09:36.770 --> 09:37.490]  Thank you.
[09:41.410 --> 09:42.970]  Somebody's been getting text messages.
[09:44.490 --> 09:45.310]  Who do you know?
[09:45.310 --> 09:46.150]  Everyone you know is here.
[09:46.850 --> 09:47.690]  Santa again.
[09:49.670 --> 09:51.090]  Feels bad about those balls.
[09:51.870 --> 09:52.710]  Alright, we got GURPS.
[09:52.950 --> 09:55.850]  Looking for the refresh on the page.
[09:55.930 --> 09:57.190]  I'm on the page refreshing also.
[09:57.670 --> 09:58.750]  I'm also on the page refreshing.
[09:59.270 --> 10:00.610]  I'm refreshing on the page right now.
[10:00.770 --> 10:02.150]  Where the GURPLR at?
[10:02.510 --> 10:03.430]  It's right there!
[10:06.410 --> 10:07.470]  I see it!
[10:09.590 --> 10:10.010]  So...
[10:11.030 --> 10:12.690]  Right now, it's the GURPLR.
[10:12.790 --> 10:14.070]  The Cosmic Coosler.
[10:14.670 --> 10:16.410]  We also have the
[10:16.410 --> 10:18.310]  individual patches.
[10:18.570 --> 10:19.830]  If you already have
[10:19.830 --> 10:21.990]  the patch shirt.
[10:22.250 --> 10:23.950]  We have the individual patches, but
[10:23.950 --> 10:26.230]  there's also the brand new 3-pack
[10:26.230 --> 10:28.410]  of No Scrumping, Protected by Falcons
[10:28.410 --> 10:29.490]  and Ian patches.
[10:29.790 --> 10:32.330]  If you want to upgrade that shirt
[10:32.330 --> 10:33.810]  right now.
[10:33.950 --> 10:35.050]  It's four shirts in one.
[10:36.350 --> 10:37.530]  The idiot pennant.
[10:38.010 --> 10:39.130]  The regulation shirt.
[10:39.270 --> 10:41.010]  Unfortunately, Ratty Boy is still there.
[10:41.010 --> 10:43.110]  But all that stuff is there now.
[10:43.610 --> 10:44.770]  regulationstore.com
[10:44.770 --> 10:46.730]  and regulationstore.store.
[10:46.850 --> 10:48.850]  Thank you everyone for coming through.
[10:49.010 --> 10:50.630]  This has been great so far.
[10:51.050 --> 10:51.830]  And who knows?
[10:52.310 --> 10:55.030]  There might even be another
[10:55.030 --> 10:56.350]  video dropping sometime.
[10:56.570 --> 10:57.250]  It's up to Andrew.
[10:57.890 --> 10:59.350]  This sucks.
[10:59.630 --> 11:01.730]  New mouse controls.
[11:02.650 --> 11:03.270]  Knock on doors.
[11:04.710 --> 11:05.510]  Matching characters.
[11:05.650 --> 11:07.390]  First team to find all matching characters wins.
[11:08.030 --> 11:08.950]  Match it up.
[11:09.010 --> 11:11.370]  You pick one, they pick one.
[11:13.630 --> 11:14.630]  Remember who's who.
[11:15.170 --> 11:17.090]  Have you tried knocking twice?
[11:19.230 --> 11:21.450]  Guys, let us know in the chat what you're grabbing.
[11:21.610 --> 11:23.150]  If you got it, grab it now.
[11:23.230 --> 11:23.990]  We got 10,000.
[11:25.370 --> 11:26.130]  Down here, Andrew.
[11:26.890 --> 11:28.350]  Waiting on Wario and Mario.
[11:29.010 --> 11:30.070]  Now we're in business.
[11:31.410 --> 11:32.810]  Lots of people in line for checkout.
[11:33.790 --> 11:34.870]  Lots of people checking out.
[11:34.870 --> 11:35.610]  Alright, Andrew.
[11:36.010 --> 11:37.090]  I'm locked in.
[11:37.530 --> 11:39.370]  So many people.
[11:40.490 --> 11:41.830]  That one's there.
[11:42.210 --> 11:43.210]  Grab it right now.
[11:44.310 --> 11:45.410]  That's the thingy.
[11:45.890 --> 11:47.530]  What is it?
[11:48.550 --> 11:48.950]  Oh, Christ.
[11:50.370 --> 11:50.930]  Yeah!
[11:51.630 --> 11:52.950]  We haven't had a match yet.
[11:53.150 --> 11:54.570]  Down here.
[11:57.410 --> 11:58.530]  Good job.
[11:59.070 --> 12:00.170]  That one's this one.
[12:00.390 --> 12:01.290]  We know that one, right?
[12:01.290 --> 12:02.470]  Yeah, we know that one.
[12:04.170 --> 12:04.850]  Why'd you do that?
[12:05.030 --> 12:05.510]  It was the wrong one.
[12:07.290 --> 12:08.430]  What are you doing?
[12:08.530 --> 12:09.350]  It's the left one.
[12:13.130 --> 12:13.770]  Easy work.
[12:14.550 --> 12:15.430]  Way to go, boys.
[12:15.590 --> 12:16.270]  Look at that.
[12:16.350 --> 12:17.850]  I'll be honest, I got GURP on the brain.
[12:18.790 --> 12:20.370]  I was looking at the chat more than the game.
[12:20.550 --> 12:21.550]  Lot of GURP.
[12:23.690 --> 12:25.550]  That's one problem with having the chat in front.
[12:25.670 --> 12:26.890]  A lot of people saying they got the GURP.
[12:27.010 --> 12:27.470]  Hell yeah.
[12:27.470 --> 12:29.790]  Hell yeah, boys.
[12:29.790 --> 12:30.610]  Finally able to get a GURP.
[12:31.170 --> 12:32.470]  Thank you so much.
[12:33.970 --> 12:35.250]  I'm so happy people are able to get it.
[12:35.710 --> 12:37.410]  It's so great to see people say they got it
[12:37.410 --> 12:38.970]  and that they didn't get it.
[12:39.090 --> 12:39.630]  Yeah, no kidding.
[12:41.030 --> 12:43.630]  We've been selling this GURP for what? A couple of minutes now?
[12:43.710 --> 12:44.150]  Three minutes?
[12:44.690 --> 12:45.370]  That's great.
[12:47.830 --> 12:49.290]  Yeah, lots of GURPS.
[12:50.130 --> 12:50.930]  Good stuff.
[12:50.930 --> 12:51.370]  GURP it!
[12:53.170 --> 12:53.770]  Ooh.
[12:54.210 --> 12:56.830]  Andrew, we gotta see what it does, right?
[12:57.490 --> 12:58.050]  GURP secured.
[12:58.550 --> 12:59.710]  Gotta do it.
[12:59.790 --> 13:01.690]  I don't know what it does. Uh oh.
[13:02.390 --> 13:03.570]  Gotta do it.
[13:03.650 --> 13:04.770]  Are you gonna turn the tower?
[13:05.290 --> 13:06.070]  Oh no.
[13:07.530 --> 13:10.310]  Okay, we gotta slow it down.
[13:11.550 --> 13:12.750]  Uh oh.
[13:13.130 --> 13:13.510]  What's this?
[13:14.350 --> 13:14.670]  No!
[13:17.230 --> 13:18.210]  It's night.
[13:20.210 --> 13:20.570]  What?
[13:21.070 --> 13:21.750]  It sounded cool in this mic.
[13:22.970 --> 13:24.650]  Should we use our dice, Geoff?
[13:24.830 --> 13:25.690]  Yeah, let's use them, baby.
[13:26.710 --> 13:27.770]  We gotta make up for...
[13:27.770 --> 13:28.510]  You gotta!
[13:28.810 --> 13:30.930]  How close are we to the top? Close enough.
[13:31.450 --> 13:33.110]  We don't want to get to the top just yet.
[13:33.590 --> 13:34.230]  Take your time.
[13:35.650 --> 13:36.750]  Nevermind, I can't roll the button.
[13:38.190 --> 13:38.590]  There you go.
[13:40.310 --> 13:41.770]  GURP secured. Still in line.
[13:42.190 --> 13:43.430]  Looking like it's still there.
[13:44.010 --> 13:45.390]  Finally got one. Gotta GURP.
[13:45.390 --> 13:46.770]  Still there, it's not sold out.
[13:47.470 --> 13:49.250]  We made it past the four minute mark.
[13:49.550 --> 13:50.510]  That's what I'm talking about.
[13:50.810 --> 13:52.110]  Let me see.
[13:58.420 --> 14:00.580]  Still in line. Wait, you got a pipe?
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.060]  Has that ever worked for you?
[14:03.240 --> 14:03.920]  In what way?
[14:04.640 --> 14:05.620]  Is it taking you somewhere good?
[14:06.120 --> 14:08.920]  Yeah, it just takes you somewhere. Like if I'm about to hit Bowser, I probably wouldn't use it.
[14:10.180 --> 14:10.880]  You know what?
[14:10.960 --> 14:12.340]  I shipped mine to the wrong address.
[14:12.540 --> 14:13.000]  Way to go!
[14:14.020 --> 14:14.820]  Oh no!
[14:15.580 --> 14:17.820]  You should contact the store ASAP.
[14:18.220 --> 14:19.640]  They can help you get that sorted out.
[14:19.840 --> 14:20.740]  Two GURPS and a KOOZLER.
[14:20.840 --> 14:21.960]  That's the regulation combo meal.
[14:22.980 --> 14:25.420]  Otherwise you'll have to shoplift it from your old property.
[14:26.100 --> 14:27.620]  You'll have to get some fancy food restaurants.
[14:28.260 --> 14:29.200]  Back to back nines!
[14:29.600 --> 14:31.280]  What a move here, Andrew.
[14:31.520 --> 14:32.440]  What are we doing here, Andrew?
[14:35.620 --> 14:36.600]  Doesn't really matter.
[14:37.100 --> 14:38.160]  Sold out Pat shirt.
[14:38.420 --> 14:38.720]  Really?
[14:40.600 --> 14:40.920]  Damn.
[14:43.100 --> 14:44.620]  At least the GURPS are sold out.
[14:44.780 --> 14:45.980]  I don't see the Pat shirt sold out.
[14:46.000 --> 14:46.880]  Maybe just their size.
[14:47.000 --> 14:47.780]  Yeah, just their size.
[14:47.820 --> 14:49.420]  Because we still have extra medium of the Pat shirt.
[14:50.620 --> 14:51.540]  Granny gum jobs!
[14:51.880 --> 14:52.700]  Holy shit, thank you.
[14:55.120 --> 14:56.040]  Alright, let's do this.
[14:56.720 --> 14:58.400]  We've got 25 to go. We don't want to get there just yet, right?
[14:58.440 --> 15:00.140]  GURPS secured. That's what I'm talking about, baby.
[15:00.560 --> 15:01.520]  That is a wolf.
[15:02.660 --> 15:03.300]  Getting guts.
[15:03.300 --> 15:04.740]  And you won't.
[15:04.740 --> 15:05.800]  You won't.
[15:07.820 --> 15:08.180]  Tough.
[15:09.220 --> 15:09.580]  Minigame!
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.800]  How are you guys liking the 2v2 format here?
[15:12.900 --> 15:13.240]  It's fun!
[15:13.360 --> 15:15.800]  I'm loving it! Nick and I are going to win every minigame.
[15:16.260 --> 15:17.480]  Gavin couldn't be unhappier.
[15:17.600 --> 15:18.900]  I think Andrew's on to something here.
[15:19.040 --> 15:21.380]  We don't have to win the first game. We can win the rest.
[15:21.700 --> 15:22.300]  Oh, arm wrestle.
[15:23.180 --> 15:23.880]  Oh, crap.
[15:26.100 --> 15:28.320]  Guys, have you ever seen a game turn off?
[15:28.380 --> 15:28.980]  Is this one of these?
[15:32.420 --> 15:33.680]  Hold Z and R.
[15:33.680 --> 15:35.120]  Oh, you have to hold both?
[15:35.320 --> 15:36.380]  Is that these two?
[15:38.920 --> 15:40.180]  Yeah, just hold the trigger down.
[15:40.580 --> 15:41.160]  Oh, just the trigger?
[15:41.620 --> 15:43.980]  And then just give it beans.
[15:44.820 --> 15:45.680]  Yeah, like that, Geoff.
[15:46.200 --> 15:47.100]  Alright, let's beat it up.
[15:48.240 --> 15:51.320]  And just hold it and just go absolutely mental.
[15:52.380 --> 15:53.500]  Kuzler is sold out.
[15:53.640 --> 15:55.120]  Cosmic Kuzler is sold out.
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.120]  3, 2, 1...
[15:57.840 --> 15:58.140]  Go!
[16:06.900 --> 16:08.260]  Oh my god!
[16:10.300 --> 16:10.740]  Teamwork.
[16:10.880 --> 16:13.620]  I think I just squirted blood from my neck into my eye.
[16:15.160 --> 16:15.600]  Jesus.
[16:17.660 --> 16:18.800]  I think my hip's out of alignment.
[16:18.800 --> 16:19.480]  Back to horizontal.
[16:21.080 --> 16:23.100]  Geoff, we're going to be broke as shit this game.
[16:26.240 --> 16:26.900]  That's okay.
[16:27.420 --> 16:29.700]  Stars are the only currency we care about.
[16:29.860 --> 16:30.740]  Oh, you have to pay for them.
[16:31.120 --> 16:31.940]  Shut up.
[16:35.440 --> 16:36.420]  Patch is gone.
[16:37.540 --> 16:39.260]  Oh, patches are sold out, yeah.
[16:39.400 --> 16:40.480]  Got some gurps left though.
[16:41.840 --> 16:43.280]  Nobody wants the gurpler.
[16:43.560 --> 16:44.920]  I'll see about getting...
[16:50.660 --> 16:52.260]  Will there be a patch hat?
[16:52.260 --> 16:54.640]  There will be a patch hat, yes.
[16:55.820 --> 16:58.620]  Patch hat is something we're working on right now.
[16:58.780 --> 16:59.740]  Patch hat's on the way.
[16:59.900 --> 17:02.880]  Pigeon patches on the way.
[17:03.260 --> 17:04.540]  Pigeon shirts on the way.
[17:04.860 --> 17:06.000]  Yeah, that's right. We're working on all that.
[17:06.120 --> 17:06.340]  Protect me cone.
[17:08.660 --> 17:10.460]  That's a line from that old show.
[17:14.300 --> 17:15.580]  It was worth it.
[17:16.640 --> 17:17.780]  Which way will you go?
[17:19.000 --> 17:19.900]  10,000 kuzlers.
[17:19.900 --> 17:22.080]  We did not buy 10,000 kuzlers.
[17:22.780 --> 17:24.100]  Definitely a lower number on that.
[17:25.440 --> 17:26.760]  Where do you think it takes you if you go the other way?
[17:26.920 --> 17:27.500]  Oh, is that boo?
[17:27.960 --> 17:28.900]  Is that boo at night?
[17:30.020 --> 17:30.560]  Nighttime boo?
[17:30.980 --> 17:32.720]  I think it's a night boo.
[17:34.200 --> 17:35.000]  Night boo!
[17:35.720 --> 17:37.340]  We're getting on you, night boo.
[17:38.900 --> 17:40.820]  Let's grab some bunts, Geoff.
[17:41.400 --> 17:43.260]  If we can't win it, we'll steal it.
[17:43.460 --> 17:44.540]  Get ready to mash, Andrew.
[17:45.700 --> 17:46.460]  I'm so ready.
[17:46.620 --> 17:48.220]  Pretend like you're playing DK, baby.
[17:48.920 --> 17:50.420]  Punch up, punch up, Andrew.
[17:50.540 --> 17:52.640]  Uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, uppercut, uppercut.
[17:53.540 --> 17:54.600]  Andrew, punch up.
[17:55.020 --> 17:55.400]  What?
[17:56.140 --> 17:57.100]  That's a great haul.
[17:58.060 --> 17:58.460]  Wow.
[17:59.740 --> 18:00.740]  Look at this.
[18:01.000 --> 18:01.720]  Half of our coins.
[18:03.960 --> 18:05.680]  It's okay, Andrew. You're coming up on boo.
[18:05.980 --> 18:07.160]  Yeah, we're going to rob them.
[18:07.400 --> 18:07.960]  We'll get it back.
[18:08.380 --> 18:11.320]  Guys, we're at eight minutes and the Gerpler is not sold out yet.
[18:11.440 --> 18:11.840]  Wow.
[18:12.800 --> 18:14.640]  We might have got the number right.
[18:14.640 --> 18:16.060]  Yeah, no kidding. This is phenomenal.
[18:16.460 --> 18:18.520]  This is so good. I'm so happy.
[18:19.460 --> 18:21.100]  The idiot flag is still there.
[18:21.200 --> 18:23.780]  The individual patches are also still there.
[18:24.020 --> 18:25.940]  If you want to get protected by Falcons
[18:25.940 --> 18:27.780]  or get an Ian or whatever.
[18:28.380 --> 18:29.160]  Reap what you sow, Gavin.
[18:29.900 --> 18:31.220]  Patch jean shorts.
[18:31.420 --> 18:31.940]  All right.
[18:32.360 --> 18:33.000]  Mash, Geoff, mash.
[18:34.720 --> 18:35.780]  I'm at the coins.
[18:35.960 --> 18:37.440]  You're getting all that money back.
[18:37.700 --> 18:40.240]  We have more than we lost.
[18:41.340 --> 18:42.980]  You got it all back.
[18:42.980 --> 18:43.040]  You got it all back.
[18:45.580 --> 18:47.120]  Somebody's got to turn that TV off.
[18:48.680 --> 18:50.320]  I can't play if that TV's on.
[18:50.640 --> 18:50.960]  Oh, no!
[18:52.560 --> 18:54.080]  That's all coins you're losing.
[18:55.060 --> 18:56.260]  I mean...
[18:56.720 --> 18:58.100]  Those three were your coins.
[18:59.040 --> 19:01.000]  Those three were your original coins.
[19:01.160 --> 19:02.320]  How far? 24. Oof.
[19:02.560 --> 19:04.300]  Are you going to restock patch shirts?
[19:04.740 --> 19:05.140]  Yes.
[19:05.920 --> 19:08.160]  We'll restock the patch shirts.
[19:08.520 --> 19:10.280]  We'll also restock patches.
[19:10.920 --> 19:12.840]  Hopefully, we can get those around
[19:12.840 --> 19:13.960]  the same time as the patch hat.
[19:14.880 --> 19:15.840]  Don't quote me on that.
[19:16.020 --> 19:17.440]  Everything takes a little bit of different time.
[19:17.640 --> 19:18.880]  We've got a long patch roadmap.
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.760]  It'll be September before you see
[19:20.760 --> 19:21.860]  any more merch from this province.
[19:23.480 --> 19:25.220]  Ooh, double the coins.
[19:25.420 --> 19:26.400]  And even then, it might be October.
[19:27.640 --> 19:29.560]  Late September. Early October.
[19:29.840 --> 19:30.720]  All right, what are we doing here?
[19:30.780 --> 19:32.740]  Tilt-a-golf. Oh, slop-a-clock patch.
[19:33.180 --> 19:35.360]  Dude, I love the idea of a slop-a-clock patch
[19:35.360 --> 19:38.100]  that nobody buys, and then once they're all gone,
[19:38.100 --> 19:39.620]  everyone reaches out and they go,
[19:39.760 --> 19:42.140]  I want one. No, I think the patch will do better than the actual
[19:42.140 --> 19:44.160]  slop-a-clock, which would be great. That's funny.
[19:45.340 --> 19:45.700]  Ah!
[19:47.100 --> 19:47.880]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[19:48.140 --> 19:50.240]  Okay, we're good. That's going to be bad. No, no, no.
[19:51.080 --> 19:52.120]  I can't believe the
[19:52.120 --> 19:53.540]  gurple is still there. I'm so happy.
[19:53.860 --> 19:55.380]  There you go, Andrew.
[19:55.580 --> 19:57.400]  All right, Andrew.
[19:57.500 --> 19:58.740]  You got it, Andrew.
[20:00.220 --> 20:01.940]  Andrew, this is your chance to shine.
[20:02.240 --> 20:03.480]  I'm working on it!
[20:03.680 --> 20:04.320]  Look out for the shark!
[20:04.320 --> 20:06.240]  What did I just say?
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.800]  Shitbags. Go, Andrew!
[20:08.420 --> 20:10.240]  Yeah, Nick! Good job!
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.060]  No, you bitch!
[20:12.380 --> 20:13.940]  Geoff, you didn't get the big...
[20:13.940 --> 20:16.080]  Geoff, get out of the fucking way!
[20:17.760 --> 20:18.540]  He's trying.
[20:18.960 --> 20:19.240]  Geoff!
[20:19.680 --> 20:20.880]  He's playing defense.
[20:21.740 --> 20:23.460]  He's like Lawrence Taylor.
[20:23.800 --> 20:24.980]  I can barely jump!
[20:26.120 --> 20:26.680]  No!
[20:28.500 --> 20:29.020]  Damn it!
[20:30.640 --> 20:31.040]  Hey, Geoff.
[20:31.040 --> 20:31.880]  Oh my God!
[20:31.880 --> 20:32.620]  Fuck off!
[20:34.640 --> 20:36.680]  Andrew's just getting dilled by those bloopers.
[20:41.080 --> 20:41.860]  Oh, man.
[20:42.940 --> 20:44.000]  Good haul for Mario.
[20:45.100 --> 20:46.940]  Patch shirt officially sold out.
[20:47.100 --> 20:47.680]  No way!
[20:49.240 --> 20:50.860]  Let's move those Ratty Boy shirts
[20:50.860 --> 20:52.340]  so we never have to see them again, guys.
[20:53.380 --> 20:55.140]  Just buy one and then
[20:55.140 --> 20:56.740]  burn it. We call it the Ratty Boy Challenge
[20:56.740 --> 20:59.360]  where you buy a Ratty Boy shirt and you just burn it in a fireplace.
[21:00.440 --> 21:01.200]  Willa what?
[21:01.740 --> 21:02.520]  Thank you.
[21:03.120 --> 21:03.560]  Willa what?
[21:05.540 --> 21:06.240]  Oh, it's me. Hello.
[21:06.920 --> 21:08.320]  Wheel of Decades patch.
[21:08.640 --> 21:10.440]  How obscure could you get now?
[21:11.820 --> 21:12.680]  Get back!
[21:13.240 --> 21:15.220]  Yeah, guys, if you like the Wheel of Decades, check out
[21:15.860 --> 21:16.300]  Charmed.
[21:17.780 --> 21:19.580]  I do love the idea of a second
[21:19.580 --> 21:20.440]  wheel patch, though.
[21:21.860 --> 21:23.640]  Do you think it's like
[21:23.640 --> 21:25.400]  the slice on the wheel?
[21:25.540 --> 21:27.440]  So imagine that it's blue on the top
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.280]  and green on the bottom.
[21:28.440 --> 21:31.520]  And it's got half a car and all that shit.
[21:31.620 --> 21:32.200]  Maple leaf.
[21:32.620 --> 21:33.840]  That's so small.
[21:36.320 --> 21:37.760]  And you can spin it
[21:37.760 --> 21:39.040]  yourself. You take it off
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.640]  to have it decide for you.
[21:40.980 --> 21:42.640]  And then you slap it back on.
[21:43.300 --> 21:46.100]  I think you spin it like this
[21:46.100 --> 21:47.240]  and you slap it on
[21:47.240 --> 21:48.580]  and whatever's at the top you can pick.
[21:49.120 --> 21:50.440]  Hang on, I'm putting in the merch slack.
[21:50.780 --> 21:53.040]  You can just toss it on there
[21:53.040 --> 21:54.760]  and depending on how you looped it,
[21:54.760 --> 21:55.860]  that's what you get.
[21:56.860 --> 21:57.560]  I love it.
[21:58.120 --> 21:58.960]  That's great.
[22:01.360 --> 22:02.920]  Charmed patch is so
[22:02.920 --> 22:03.280]  good.
[22:04.680 --> 22:06.460]  You could roll a 20 with your eye.
[22:07.500 --> 22:08.800]  Yeah, but it'd have to be perfect.
[22:09.000 --> 22:09.320]  It would.
[22:10.820 --> 22:12.540]  Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
[22:13.360 --> 22:13.540]  Woo!
[22:14.440 --> 22:15.080]  Sage advice.
[22:17.260 --> 22:18.660]  Andrew Goof World patch.
[22:20.580 --> 22:22.620]  Okay, I'm putting a wheel patch.
[22:22.620 --> 22:24.240]  It's a full wheel.
[22:24.660 --> 22:26.820]  You take it off, you spin it, you put it on
[22:26.820 --> 22:28.520]  and then it's made the choice for you
[22:28.520 --> 22:29.320]  for whatever that is.
[22:29.420 --> 22:31.860]  I like the idea of Andrew's Goof World patch just being a clock
[22:31.860 --> 22:33.100]  with 10 o'clock on it twice.
[22:34.580 --> 22:36.140]  What if we did another clock?
[22:36.240 --> 22:38.700]  Wait, you're calling me into action?
[22:38.860 --> 22:39.640]  Wait, how are you doing this?
[22:40.420 --> 22:42.040]  Hell yeah, let's do this.
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.120]  Oh, wow!
[22:45.580 --> 22:47.180]  We got five coins for hanging out.
[22:47.800 --> 22:48.540]  To do that?
[22:48.540 --> 22:49.220]  Yeah.
[22:49.220 --> 22:50.300]  On purpose.
[22:51.560 --> 22:52.480]  Okay, here we go.
[22:52.580 --> 22:53.680]  We win it.
[22:55.360 --> 22:57.340]  We gotta keep the streak going.
[22:57.600 --> 22:58.660]  Ice it easy.
[22:59.860 --> 23:00.400]  Icy hot.
[23:01.100 --> 23:03.720]  Somebody had a good idea of Sheriff of Goof World
[23:03.720 --> 23:05.940]  and I'm thinking it's the patch.
[23:06.060 --> 23:06.700]  It's like a badge.
[23:09.960 --> 23:11.580]  Alright, let's do the mousing and clicking.
[23:12.040 --> 23:13.600]  Yeah, this is it. This is easy.
[23:14.160 --> 23:15.040]  There you go.
[23:15.480 --> 23:16.840]  Run and then grab it.
[23:16.860 --> 23:17.560]  And then slide.
[23:18.420 --> 23:19.060]  That's it.
[23:21.700 --> 23:23.580]  I don't know if it's as many
[23:23.580 --> 23:24.920]  because you don't want to go too far.
[23:24.980 --> 23:25.820]  I want to see it one more time.
[23:33.460 --> 23:35.060]  You feel like you cracked the code, Nick?
[23:35.200 --> 23:35.400]  Nope.
[23:38.760 --> 23:40.340]  You feel like you cracked the code, Gavin?
[23:40.520 --> 23:40.760]  Yeah.
[23:41.820 --> 23:42.880]  I'm decoding right now.
[23:47.560 --> 23:48.340]  Oh, look at that.
[23:50.780 --> 23:51.220]  No!
[23:51.580 --> 23:52.140]  Sorry, Nick.
[23:53.100 --> 23:54.240]  Oh, your leg!
[23:54.360 --> 23:54.540]  Yeah!
[23:58.740 --> 23:59.620]  Good work.
[24:00.480 --> 24:01.300]  I'll go left.
[24:01.840 --> 24:03.040]  Yeah, I'll go right.
[24:03.260 --> 24:04.340]  Oh, I blew it.
[24:05.320 --> 24:06.320]  I absolutely blew it.
[24:06.940 --> 24:09.460]  That's okay, I also blew it, but at least I got some.
[24:09.820 --> 24:10.340]  Oh, wow.
[24:10.540 --> 24:10.980]  Get me there!
[24:13.720 --> 24:15.020]  Oh, my God.
[24:15.020 --> 24:16.600]  Give everything you got, boys.
[24:17.360 --> 24:18.840]  Oh, there's a gold one.
[24:19.380 --> 24:20.420]  Nice, Geoff.
[24:20.500 --> 24:20.860]  Come back!
[24:23.440 --> 24:25.340]  They found their game here, boys.
[24:25.940 --> 24:26.400]  Dammit!
[24:26.640 --> 24:27.980]  Suck our buttholes.
[24:28.160 --> 24:28.760]  That was incredible.
[24:30.240 --> 24:31.220]  Congrats on your one.
[24:31.500 --> 24:31.980]  Thank you.
[24:36.920 --> 24:41.920]  Hey, if you're an extra large
[24:41.920 --> 24:43.640]  and you need a patched shirt, it's back.
[24:43.640 --> 24:44.840]  Oh, we found more?
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.520]  I think so. I think they're actively going through
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.120]  and making sure that stock is updated.
[24:49.360 --> 24:51.180]  As you're clicking, there's people rummaging.
[24:51.380 --> 24:52.880]  Yes, we got rummagers.
[24:55.560 --> 24:55.960]  Rummages.
[24:57.640 --> 24:59.420]  Wow, we're already a third of the way through this game.
[25:00.880 --> 25:01.500]  Yeah, good call,
[25:01.620 --> 25:02.380]  bumping into 15.
[25:04.160 --> 25:05.120]  Did we take the risk?
[25:05.620 --> 25:06.000]  Nah.
[25:06.120 --> 25:08.660]  Yeah, man, that Kuzler was in fucking heavy demand.
[25:09.420 --> 25:11.120]  Dude, we say it every time.
[25:11.120 --> 25:12.820]  We just go, having Kuzlers,
[25:13.140 --> 25:15.240]  throw it on there, whatever, and then everyone buys it
[25:15.240 --> 25:15.940]  and it's stunning.
[25:16.140 --> 25:18.680]  We gotta make more Kuzlers, I guess?
[25:18.860 --> 25:20.260]  I think just do as many as the gut.
[25:20.580 --> 25:22.380]  Yeah, I suppose so, huh?
[25:23.040 --> 25:24.920]  Or maybe 60%.
[25:24.920 --> 25:25.700]  Warrior time.
[25:26.800 --> 25:29.220]  I like it. Again, we're doing the same thing.
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.200]  Yeah, we'll just get less.
[25:32.200 --> 25:33.160]  It's the conversation
[25:33.160 --> 25:33.900]  we just had.
[25:35.100 --> 25:36.740]  In almost the same sentence.
[25:36.740 --> 25:39.380]  Yeah, but go again.
[25:39.580 --> 25:40.060]  No!
[25:41.060 --> 25:41.340]  Uh-oh.
[25:43.400 --> 25:44.360]  Warrior, why?
[25:44.760 --> 25:46.240]  You're ahead of me, so that's great.
[25:49.800 --> 25:50.000]  Okay.
[25:54.480 --> 25:56.060]  Scotch German. I agree with Geoff.
[25:56.380 --> 25:57.380]  60-75%.
[25:57.380 --> 25:59.680]  Okay, Pat's shirt is sold out again.
[26:01.240 --> 26:02.140]  Dill Kong.
[26:03.340 --> 26:04.240]  Dill Kong.
[26:04.260 --> 26:06.700]  So if I wanted to buy a Kuzler right now,
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.280]  if I just got out of a movie...
[26:08.280 --> 26:08.860]  That's not low!
[26:09.160 --> 26:11.320]  What about a Gerpler?
[26:11.620 --> 26:12.600]  You could buy a Gerpler, yeah.
[26:13.340 --> 26:15.840]  You could buy also the individual patches
[26:15.840 --> 26:17.060]  instead of the patch pack.
[26:17.820 --> 26:19.420]  If you want to do that.
[26:21.080 --> 26:21.380]  Yeah!
[26:22.180 --> 26:22.420]  Yeah!
[26:27.410 --> 26:27.670]  Alright.
[26:27.850 --> 26:29.590]  Thank you guys for being here on a Friday
[26:29.590 --> 26:31.550]  for a different stream.
[26:32.470 --> 26:33.690]  Some Mario Party and stuff.
[26:33.970 --> 26:34.590]  For hanging out with us.
[26:34.590 --> 26:36.030]  To buy our crap.
[26:36.070 --> 26:36.990]  We really appreciate that.
[26:38.310 --> 26:40.250]  Hey guys, thanks for buying our stupid bullshit.
[26:40.410 --> 26:41.930]  Oh look! Geoff's sending it back!
[26:42.490 --> 26:43.150]  Oh no!
[26:43.650 --> 26:44.050]  Yeah!
[26:47.710 --> 26:48.110]  Alright!
[26:49.390 --> 26:50.150]  Two homies.
[26:50.410 --> 26:50.490]  Uh-oh.
[26:52.030 --> 26:54.510]  There's nothing better than just seeing how many people are getting their goods.
[26:54.730 --> 26:55.410]  Yeah, this is great.
[26:55.670 --> 26:56.670]  And they're still available.
[26:57.770 --> 26:59.550]  Again, 17 minutes.
[27:00.170 --> 27:00.950]  And they're still available.
[27:02.170 --> 27:02.530]  Crazy.
[27:02.530 --> 27:05.470]  Is it possible to get one of the delivery fees refunded?
[27:05.530 --> 27:06.390]  I don't know if we have the capability.
[27:06.390 --> 27:08.430]  You can reach out to the store
[27:08.430 --> 27:10.830]  and see if they can combine, but we can't guarantee it.
[27:10.830 --> 27:12.890]  Yeah, I would say maybe if you're really fast with an email.
[27:13.210 --> 27:13.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:15.970 --> 27:16.690]  Stuffy stacker.
[27:16.890 --> 27:17.310]  Domino effect.
[27:17.310 --> 27:19.570]  They ship stuff out quickly.
[27:19.750 --> 27:20.510]  What is this?
[27:22.270 --> 27:24.030]  I love these new mouse games.
[27:27.860 --> 27:29.180]  Hey, you have a flat surface!
[27:30.780 --> 27:31.500]  His leg?
[27:32.260 --> 27:33.540]  No, he's doing the table.
[27:34.740 --> 27:35.780]  Gavin's just been playing on his leg.
[27:35.900 --> 27:36.680]  I'm talking about Geoff!
[27:37.700 --> 27:38.900]  I'm also doing my leg.
[27:38.960 --> 27:40.420]  Yeah, as you say, I don't think you should worry about it too much.
[27:40.540 --> 27:42.620]  Line up enough dominoes to reach the flower pot.
[27:42.700 --> 27:43.480]  So, these are the obstacles.
[27:44.440 --> 27:45.740]  Shit. That's nuts.
[27:46.520 --> 27:48.820]  So, what are we doing?
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.540]  We have to push from the toad.
[27:51.780 --> 27:53.020]  Oh, we can rotate them.
[27:54.560 --> 27:56.200]  What if you work on the flower side, Geoff?
[27:56.240 --> 27:57.600]  And I'll work on the toad side.
[27:57.680 --> 27:59.440]  Okay, so what do I do on the flower side here?
[27:59.440 --> 28:00.680]  Just build towards me.
[28:01.520 --> 28:03.620]  Oh, we're making a game of dominoes.
[28:04.300 --> 28:04.520]  Sure.
[28:04.820 --> 28:05.980]  Yeah, we'll do that, Nick.
[28:06.320 --> 28:07.620]  I think you got this one, Gavin.
[28:07.920 --> 28:11.420]  I think Team G's got this thing, dude.
[28:11.480 --> 28:13.880]  Plan G, and you can spin your wrist to rotate it.
[28:14.620 --> 28:14.980]  Okay.
[28:15.480 --> 28:16.700]  Oh, balls. We're fucked.
[28:17.240 --> 28:19.140]  And if your gyro gets messed up, press the bottom.
[28:19.920 --> 28:20.260]  Press B.
[28:20.640 --> 28:21.300]  Press B?
[28:23.720 --> 28:24.780]  Do you feel good about it?
[28:25.100 --> 28:25.380]  Yeah.
[28:26.520 --> 28:27.600]  This is gonna be awesome.
[28:27.720 --> 28:28.020]  Not a little.
[28:28.220 --> 28:30.000]  Alright, Team G, lock in. Let's go.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.200]  I love Team G.
[28:32.760 --> 28:33.460]  Here we go.
[28:33.980 --> 28:34.700]  Oh, God.
[28:36.940 --> 28:38.260]  This game is crazy.
[28:38.420 --> 28:41.680]  This is a great...
[28:42.060 --> 28:43.340]  Gotta figure out how to meet in the middle.
[28:43.700 --> 28:44.980]  Yeah, okay. Off to a good start.
[28:45.160 --> 28:46.800]  This is good. There you go.
[28:47.080 --> 28:48.140]  I wonder how far these fall.
[28:51.420 --> 28:53.700]  Wow, this is really precise.
[28:53.700 --> 28:54.540]  This is a tough one.
[28:54.780 --> 28:56.080]  May have spaced these too much.
[28:56.800 --> 28:59.180]  It's crazy that you can do this with the Nintendo system.
[28:59.520 --> 29:02.120]  I get why they put Mario Paint back on this thing.
[29:02.280 --> 29:04.580]  Remember when Starcraft 64 was on 64?
[29:04.780 --> 29:05.400]  Dude, insane.
[29:07.500 --> 29:08.840]  I'm still waiting on Ghost, man.
[29:09.660 --> 29:10.200]  One day.
[29:11.240 --> 29:12.200]  You guys might have it.
[29:12.720 --> 29:13.460]  You guys might have it!
[29:14.480 --> 29:15.740]  Oh, shit!
[29:15.800 --> 29:18.920]  We gotta get away from that piranha.
[29:20.440 --> 29:21.440]  No, you bastard!
[29:21.440 --> 29:23.360]  We gotta get a little...
[29:23.360 --> 29:24.080]  Oh, no!
[29:24.900 --> 29:25.440]  Now what?
[29:25.620 --> 29:26.840]  Tell him to do it.
[29:27.880 --> 29:28.380]  No!
[29:31.260 --> 29:32.080]  Oh, miss it.
[29:32.480 --> 29:33.880]  Yeah, he missed it!
[29:38.280 --> 29:39.480]  He missed it!
[29:42.820 --> 29:44.080]  He missed it!
[29:44.620 --> 29:46.840]  I watched him put that first one down.
[29:46.980 --> 29:49.560]  I went, that's crazy. I wonder if he's gonna put down another one.
[29:49.560 --> 29:51.060]  Never came back to it.
[29:51.080 --> 29:52.680]  It just barely missed it.
[29:52.860 --> 29:54.440]  It was like two pixels.
[29:55.080 --> 29:58.840]  Technically, we lost that two seconds into the game.
[29:59.760 --> 30:01.640]  It was just a pixel away.
[30:02.840 --> 30:04.140]  We won't lose again.
[30:04.720 --> 30:07.700]  I think I looked at the whole run except for the end.
[30:07.920 --> 30:08.460]  Oh, man.
[30:08.640 --> 30:11.160]  Nick, I think this is a dice situation.
[30:11.540 --> 30:14.640]  I hope some people buy a Gerpler to make me feel better.
[30:14.900 --> 30:15.900]  The Gerpler's still there.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.660]  And if you're an extra medium,
[30:17.660 --> 30:19.780]  the patch shirt is back.
[30:21.080 --> 30:22.940]  Guys, grab an extra medium patch shirt.
[30:23.200 --> 30:24.000]  Oh, we found more of that?
[30:26.980 --> 30:28.840]  How could they do this to you?
[30:29.040 --> 30:29.540]  Yeah, I don't know.
[30:29.580 --> 30:30.940]  It was like a pixel off.
[30:32.880 --> 30:33.840]  Oh, they're making it.
[30:34.120 --> 30:34.560]  Yes!
[30:35.080 --> 30:36.440]  That was crazy.
[30:36.900 --> 30:37.960]  That was so cool.
[30:38.080 --> 30:38.860]  That was so close.
[30:40.500 --> 30:41.700]  We were so close.
[30:41.960 --> 30:43.080]  That was close as dicks.
[30:43.080 --> 30:43.880]  That couldn't have been close.
[30:45.020 --> 30:46.660]  Oh, thank you, Team G.
[30:47.000 --> 30:47.600]  Thanks, guys.
[30:48.900 --> 30:49.720]  Oh, God.
[30:50.840 --> 30:52.280]  Thanks, John72.
[30:53.900 --> 30:54.360]  What did he say?
[30:54.580 --> 30:55.760]  He just subbed.
[30:56.800 --> 30:59.320]  Oh, God.
[31:01.980 --> 31:03.420]  That's bad news.
[31:06.860 --> 31:08.220]  That was...
[31:08.220 --> 31:09.640]  I missed.
[31:09.640 --> 31:11.380]  It was so awesome.
[31:11.580 --> 31:12.580]  That was so good.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.480]  I just keep thinking about it.
[31:20.360 --> 31:20.940]  Man.
[31:21.460 --> 31:22.480]  Big roll.
[31:23.440 --> 31:25.720]  21 minutes and we still have Gerplers, boys.
[31:25.920 --> 31:26.320]  Oh, God.
[31:29.040 --> 31:32.340]  Hopefully roll low enough for someone to swap it back.
[31:32.660 --> 31:33.240]  Oh, nice.
[31:39.820 --> 31:41.480]  Oh, that's actually good.
[31:42.040 --> 31:43.140]  That's good while it's Bowser.
[31:44.240 --> 31:45.460]  Can you put it on yourself?
[31:45.720 --> 31:45.860]  Yeah.
[31:46.140 --> 31:47.580]  I don't know.
[31:48.780 --> 31:49.700]  Low roll.
[31:53.240 --> 31:54.140]  Low roll.
[31:54.980 --> 31:55.600]  Oh, God.
[31:56.720 --> 31:57.160]  Yes!
[31:59.620 --> 32:00.220]  No!
[32:00.220 --> 32:00.300]  No!
[32:10.280 --> 32:12.500]  Can we get a little Cuckstool
[32:13.120 --> 32:14.180]  bench engraving on it?
[32:15.180 --> 32:16.140]  We should get a little
[32:16.140 --> 32:17.840]  emote of just this little stool.
[32:18.100 --> 32:20.360]  I like the idea of a little park
[32:20.360 --> 32:22.360]  bench that says Cuckstool on there.
[32:22.660 --> 32:24.080]  Subbing makes you a comment leaver, yes.
[32:24.480 --> 32:24.960]  It does.
[32:25.460 --> 32:27.060]  Yeah. Your turn, Geoff.
[32:27.580 --> 32:28.280]  Oh, yeah.
[32:29.060 --> 32:30.720]  Does subbing make you a comment leaver?
[32:31.520 --> 32:32.000]  Uh...
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.900]  Does it include a message when you sub?
[32:34.280 --> 32:36.680]  Yeah, it says that you subbed.
[32:36.780 --> 32:38.000]  But you didn't write that.
[32:38.500 --> 32:39.680]  But asking the question does.
[32:40.040 --> 32:42.220]  Oh, yeah, you're absolutely in.
[32:45.580 --> 32:46.380]  MarkTheFrog said,
[32:46.740 --> 32:48.340]  Audio-only Mario Party is weird.
[32:49.040 --> 32:50.820]  MarkTheFrog rules. He sent that message
[32:50.820 --> 32:52.940]  voice-to-text. He's not watching this.
[32:53.020 --> 32:54.160]  He's only listening to it.
[32:54.160 --> 32:56.280]  Oh, look at this, Geoff. This is cool.
[32:57.300 --> 32:57.840]  Oh, Christ.
[32:57.980 --> 33:00.120]  Alright, you gotta stop the wheel, buddy.
[33:00.720 --> 33:02.080]  Jimmy Tartare, we need a
[33:02.080 --> 33:03.160]  cum patch, too.
[33:05.400 --> 33:06.400]  Oh, interesting.
[33:08.180 --> 33:08.680]  Nope.
[33:10.120 --> 33:11.760]  So does it just take every turn?
[33:12.060 --> 33:12.300]  Yes.
[33:14.860 --> 33:15.360]  Maybe.
[33:20.520 --> 33:21.640]  I'm just doing what you did.
[33:21.640 --> 33:23.660]  I don't like that they have two little dice.
[33:23.980 --> 33:25.460]  Not a fan. Not a fan either.
[33:26.260 --> 33:27.820]  This company is so confidently
[33:27.820 --> 33:28.260]  maybe.
[33:29.540 --> 33:31.760]  Oh. That was a movie, right?
[33:32.540 --> 33:33.160]  Confidently maybe.
[33:36.220 --> 33:36.640]  Sandwiched?
[33:36.640 --> 33:39.420]  We gotta dodge them.
[33:39.680 --> 33:41.360]  How flat are they? Oh, yeah.
[33:41.540 --> 33:43.560]  Okay, cool. Alright, we got this, Geoff.
[33:43.820 --> 33:45.900]  Yeah. I'm actually dogshit at this one.
[33:45.920 --> 33:47.160]  My ankle integrity is awesome.
[33:48.780 --> 33:49.900]  My sandwich integrity
[33:49.900 --> 33:50.580]  is through the roof.
[33:55.380 --> 33:56.100]  Sandwich time.
[33:57.000 --> 33:57.400]  Oh.
[33:59.080 --> 33:59.960]  Oh, God.
[34:00.140 --> 34:01.940]  Okay. It doesn't continue
[34:01.940 --> 34:02.440]  at least.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.920]  Ew, gross. You guys are jumping on egg salad?
[34:06.060 --> 34:07.120]  Gross. Dude, egg salad's delicious.
[34:08.340 --> 34:09.440]  I'm not mad at egg salad.
[34:09.440 --> 34:10.020]  Oh, God.
[34:10.980 --> 34:13.120]  Oh, no.
[34:14.160 --> 34:15.440]  You'll eat egg salad, Geoff?
[34:15.720 --> 34:17.720]  I can, yeah. Oh, that's interesting.
[34:18.560 --> 34:19.520]  Oh, Geoff!
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.020]  You fuck!
[34:22.200 --> 34:22.960]  Oh, what's up, bud?
[34:23.880 --> 34:24.560]  It's up to you, DK.
[34:26.600 --> 34:27.440]  What a move.
[34:28.360 --> 34:29.200]  What a move.
[34:29.580 --> 34:31.180]  Andrew's locked in. He's going in.
[34:31.220 --> 34:32.280]  Sandwiches, Wario!
[34:32.840 --> 34:33.320]  Yeah!
[34:35.460 --> 34:37.460]  Deal, deal, deal, deal, deal.
[34:39.200 --> 34:39.680]  Wow.
[34:39.720 --> 34:41.260]  A game that doesn't matter if I lose.
[34:41.320 --> 34:43.960]  Thanks, Andrew. No problem, buddy.
[34:45.240 --> 34:46.320]  Team No Bad Ideas.
[34:46.320 --> 34:47.060]  That's a win for Nick.
[34:47.840 --> 34:50.580]  At what time is it morally acceptable
[34:50.580 --> 34:52.580]  to buy a second, third, and fourth GURP?
[34:52.680 --> 34:54.380]  I mean, it's been 25 minutes.
[34:54.520 --> 34:55.160]  I think you're good.
[34:55.560 --> 34:58.180]  If you want to buy more, I say now is the time.
[34:58.300 --> 35:00.180]  I think we have over a thousand left.
[35:00.500 --> 35:01.520]  Barber Blopper.
[35:04.640 --> 35:06.160]  I keep checking the YouTube
[35:06.160 --> 35:08.120]  to see if that video got uploaded.
[35:08.300 --> 35:08.960]  It's processing.
[35:10.480 --> 35:10.880]  Oh.
[35:12.660 --> 35:14.940]  Let's put that video live in eight turns.
[35:14.940 --> 35:16.060]  What do you think, Andrew? Anything here?
[35:17.200 --> 35:17.940]  Tower turn.
[35:18.160 --> 35:21.340]  Oh, yeah! I'm going to buy that for us.
[35:21.620 --> 35:22.960]  Yeah! Good move.
[35:24.160 --> 35:25.000]  Patty Melt Burger
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.400]  and three PBRs for
[35:27.060 --> 35:27.940]  Mark the Frog.
[35:28.380 --> 35:30.780]  That sounds right. Damn, that sounds like a nice lunch.
[35:31.280 --> 35:32.920]  Arctic Hot Dog says Glorbosis
[35:32.920 --> 35:33.800]  GURP-La next.
[35:34.020 --> 35:36.660]  I don't think we could show that. That would be a Blurp-La.
[35:41.920 --> 35:43.100]  What is that? A GURP-Lite?
[35:43.100 --> 35:45.780]  Should we just sell a GURP-La with blurry text?
[35:46.980 --> 35:48.680]  Check it out! This looks worse.
[35:49.520 --> 35:50.440]  Let's sell a Blurp-La.
[35:50.500 --> 35:51.560]  Can you put that in the notes?
[35:54.320 --> 35:55.560]  Geoff, should I roll the dice?
[35:58.840 --> 35:59.240]  Yeah.
[36:00.240 --> 36:00.960]  Put it on myself.
[36:06.120 --> 36:06.780]  It's in there.
[36:07.640 --> 36:08.200]  Thank you.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  Make you know what to do.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.020]  Wait, it's your turn, though.
[36:12.720 --> 36:13.560]  Yeah, but next turn.
[36:14.240 --> 36:15.620]  I mean, if I roll high,
[36:15.960 --> 36:16.860]  you know what to do.
[36:17.220 --> 36:19.960]  How far are you from it?
[36:20.920 --> 36:21.700]  I'm pretty close.
[36:21.840 --> 36:23.700]  I'm like seven-ish away, I think.
[36:26.900 --> 36:28.160]  You have access to it.
[36:29.780 --> 36:30.140]  Blammo!
[36:33.260 --> 36:34.000]  That's a nice...
[36:36.120 --> 36:38.280]  I guess, Andrew, it's up to you. Are you feeling lucky?
[36:38.280 --> 36:39.360]  Money for running.
[36:39.580 --> 36:41.120]  Do GURPs hold up to coffee?
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.360]  Geoff is drinking coffee out of his GURP-La right now.
[36:43.860 --> 36:45.300]  What about hot coffee?
[36:45.680 --> 36:47.940]  I don't know. I wouldn't put hot coffee in a plastic cup.
[36:48.160 --> 36:49.940]  Do it.
[36:50.200 --> 36:51.020]  I'm always willing to gamble.
[36:52.060 --> 36:54.700]  Hot coffee is what got Grand Theft Auto banned in Australia.
[36:56.800 --> 36:58.100]  Was that San Andreas?
[36:58.640 --> 36:58.860]  Yeah.
[37:00.520 --> 37:01.900]  Remember that from 20 years ago?
[37:01.940 --> 37:02.700]  Oh, we don't know!
[37:04.540 --> 37:04.860]  Wait.
[37:05.620 --> 37:07.400]  Oh my god.
[37:07.400 --> 37:08.040]  It stays.
[37:08.880 --> 37:09.660]  It's not guaranteed.
[37:10.040 --> 37:10.720]  That thing sucks.
[37:10.980 --> 37:13.080]  That was 20 coins.
[37:13.600 --> 37:14.400]  Roll low.
[37:16.560 --> 37:16.900]  No!
[37:19.760 --> 37:20.780]  Oh balls.
[37:21.660 --> 37:22.660]  What does he do?
[37:23.200 --> 37:24.480]  Is it just a normal Bowser space?
[37:25.960 --> 37:28.920]  He charges me and then he kicks me to the main...
[37:28.920 --> 37:31.560]  Michael Parsons has requested a trade.
[37:32.160 --> 37:34.080]  Sweet! Cowboys are going to suck shit.
[37:35.200 --> 37:36.340]  Doesn't mean he'll get a trade.
[37:36.440 --> 37:38.540]  Now, to be fair, they're going to suck shit anyway.
[37:38.640 --> 37:40.460]  Oh yeah, you know what? Fair point. Jerry Jones is still there.
[37:41.480 --> 37:44.580]  But at least his terrible son is going to take over and he's worse.
[37:44.840 --> 37:45.600]  You got a Zatar.
[37:45.880 --> 37:46.280]  Zatar!
[37:47.320 --> 37:48.500]  Some Labo bullshit.
[37:48.840 --> 37:50.800]  Wait a second. He made fun of you?
[37:51.720 --> 37:52.500]  Oh damn!
[37:52.760 --> 37:54.400]  Guys, don't put hot drinks in plastic.
[37:54.800 --> 37:57.360]  Did you say Labo bullshit?
[37:57.780 --> 37:58.000]  Yeah.
[37:58.000 --> 37:58.520]  Yeah.
[37:59.080 --> 38:00.600]  Some cardboard ass shit.
[38:01.940 --> 38:03.420]  And red. Great.
[38:04.200 --> 38:06.460]  Did they announce anything good at the...
[38:06.460 --> 38:07.560]  the showcase?
[38:08.720 --> 38:09.000]  No.
[38:09.200 --> 38:12.220]  Oh Geoff, use...
[38:12.220 --> 38:13.900]  No, no, no, no. Roll, roll, roll.
[38:14.300 --> 38:15.220]  Use the golden block.
[38:16.440 --> 38:17.420]  Use the pipes.
[38:18.100 --> 38:18.180]  No.
[38:19.940 --> 38:20.560]  Use the pipes.
[38:20.820 --> 38:22.100]  Low, low, low.
[38:22.960 --> 38:23.800]  Less than eight.
[38:25.140 --> 38:25.540]  Yeah!
[38:26.340 --> 38:26.500]  Damn it.
[38:27.620 --> 38:29.400]  Wow, that is good money for you.
[38:30.960 --> 38:32.140]  We gambled, Andrew.
[38:32.500 --> 38:33.960]  Team G fucking run away with it, dude.
[38:34.120 --> 38:35.820]  But we didn't even know that it could do that.
[38:36.140 --> 38:37.180]  No, but it was... you know what?
[38:37.580 --> 38:39.840]  The dice worked, so the gamble is worth it.
[38:40.180 --> 38:40.420]  Yeah.
[38:41.800 --> 38:42.860]  What does that mean?
[38:43.000 --> 38:43.380]  I don't know.
[38:43.860 --> 38:46.920]  That means I rolled enough spaces to reach the star,
[38:47.060 --> 38:50.140]  so if it would have flipped it, like that was the right move.
[38:50.500 --> 38:50.800]  Got it, got it.
[38:50.800 --> 38:53.660]  It didn't go our way, but we made all the right moves.
[38:53.660 --> 38:54.020]  We did a little star, right?
[38:54.600 --> 38:55.300]  You want to get it?
[38:55.520 --> 38:58.800]  I was so tempted to just...
[38:59.460 --> 39:00.860]  Slap the shit out of your hand.
[39:04.740 --> 39:06.600]  Not sure how I feel about a pixelated...
[39:06.600 --> 39:07.420]  I'm just looking at it.
[39:07.760 --> 39:09.920]  I'm in a hurry. I want to savor this moment.
[39:11.940 --> 39:12.980]  How did we get here?
[39:14.800 --> 39:17.540]  So we're like... we've almost been selling this Gerpliff for half an hour, right?
[39:17.540 --> 39:19.220]  Half an hour, yeah. It's just about to be half an hour.
[39:19.220 --> 39:22.800]  I think my ultimate goal would be to sell it for an hour.
[39:23.100 --> 39:23.500]  Oh really?
[39:23.760 --> 39:25.940]  Dude, I was very happy that it was at least half an hour.
[39:26.120 --> 39:27.360]  I was like, oh man.
[39:27.520 --> 39:29.000]  If we can do 15 minutes awesome,
[39:29.460 --> 39:30.840]  if it hits half an hour, I'm happy.
[39:31.600 --> 39:33.160]  You think we can make an hour?
[39:33.480 --> 39:34.700]  I think that would be...
[39:35.660 --> 39:38.400]  Indicative of a correct amount of ordered Gerpliffs.
[39:38.760 --> 39:39.740]  And then think about it,
[39:39.780 --> 39:41.040]  60% of Koozlers too?
[39:41.240 --> 39:41.840]  That would have been incredible.
[39:45.960 --> 39:47.960]  Can we get a baby bottle called the Berpler?
[39:50.100 --> 39:52.100]  And then you can go right now
[39:52.100 --> 39:53.460]  to youtube.com
[39:54.560 --> 39:55.240]  slash, I don't know,
[39:55.300 --> 39:56.920]  what is this, Regulation Podcast, and you can watch
[39:56.920 --> 39:57.900]  The Flattest Sandwich.
[39:58.060 --> 40:01.300]  Oh, and he's put the wrong thumbnail on it.
[40:01.560 --> 40:02.120]  It's live!
[40:02.540 --> 40:03.960]  Wait, why would that be the wrong thumbnail?
[40:04.040 --> 40:05.500]  That's the perfect thumbnail.
[40:06.920 --> 40:09.420]  I thought we agreed that if there was a whole thumbnail,
[40:09.580 --> 40:10.500]  that that was going to be it.
[40:10.500 --> 40:12.000]  When Geoff can't make one, that's the one to use.
[40:12.300 --> 40:14.300]  And that was it. So we're done.
[40:15.340 --> 40:16.820]  Or is that the one we're going to use every time?
[40:17.300 --> 40:18.940]  I mean, that's the thumbnail we're going to use
[40:18.940 --> 40:20.560]  every time until we get a corrected thumbnail.
[40:20.680 --> 40:20.900]  Gotcha.
[40:21.920 --> 40:23.720]  Which we should do pretty quickly.
[40:24.940 --> 40:26.120]  Well, we're in the middle of this.
[40:26.220 --> 40:27.400]  I mean, you made the thumbnail.
[40:28.100 --> 40:29.300]  It's your thumbnail.
[40:30.040 --> 40:30.920]  You made the video too.
[40:32.960 --> 40:33.900]  Play with mouse.
[40:38.590 --> 40:39.390]  It did.
[40:39.490 --> 40:40.230]  We're locked in.
[40:41.170 --> 40:41.950]  Oh God.
[40:43.090 --> 40:45.130]  Move as many Bob-ombs to the other team's...
[40:45.130 --> 40:46.210]  Oh my God!
[40:46.210 --> 40:47.010]  It's just drag and drop.
[40:47.310 --> 40:49.990]  I might need a table for this one.
[40:50.730 --> 40:51.650]  Move your drinks.
[40:52.310 --> 40:52.950]  Oh, you fuck.
[40:54.110 --> 40:55.510]  The mic doesn't go that way.
[40:55.990 --> 40:57.990]  Oh, it doesn't.
[40:58.810 --> 41:00.610]  Was this video inspired by the
[41:00.610 --> 41:02.270]  TikTok of the guy that fell on the sandwich?
[41:02.490 --> 41:04.510]  Yeah, you should watch the video where we explain that.
[41:04.990 --> 41:05.390]  Oh no!
[41:06.590 --> 41:06.930]  It's okay.
[41:07.290 --> 41:08.730]  Get over there.
[41:08.990 --> 41:09.390]  Get over there.
[41:13.090 --> 41:13.890]  Uh-oh.
[41:13.890 --> 41:15.590]  There's a lot on the left, boys.
[41:17.790 --> 41:19.370]  A lot on the left.
[41:19.870 --> 41:20.430]  I got lost.
[41:21.730 --> 41:22.510]  Find yourself.
[41:23.710 --> 41:25.910]  Wow, it is neck and neck,
[41:26.050 --> 41:27.450]  but dude, the left is like hurting.
[41:27.890 --> 41:28.450]  Oh no!
[41:28.730 --> 41:31.190]  I think we lost.
[41:31.290 --> 41:31.690]  We lost.
[41:33.630 --> 41:34.470]  Oh, never mind.
[41:36.830 --> 41:37.270]  Baboom.
[41:42.780 --> 41:44.400]  See that Gav? We got it when it counts.
[41:44.400 --> 41:45.960]  Yeah, you guys gotta lock in.
[41:46.040 --> 41:48.460]  We got a strong start, Andrew. We gotta finish strong.
[41:49.560 --> 41:50.140]  Yeah, it's fine.
[41:50.720 --> 41:51.760]  We'll steal their star.
[41:52.600 --> 41:52.720]  These.
[41:54.660 --> 41:55.380]  No honor.
[41:58.730 --> 41:59.090]  Yes.
[42:02.390 --> 42:03.590]  Eric, are you pumped about
[42:03.590 --> 42:04.730]  Mason Miller to the Padres?
[42:05.150 --> 42:05.970]  Yeah, I think it's a great move.
[42:06.750 --> 42:09.030]  I think we gave up a lot in this trade,
[42:09.150 --> 42:11.030]  but I think I'm happy with where we're at.
[42:11.690 --> 42:13.310]  I'm so excited to watch the Phillies play
[42:13.310 --> 42:14.870]  after they picked up an actual closer.
[42:15.130 --> 42:16.870]  Who'd they get? Uh, what's his name?
[42:17.090 --> 42:17.530]  Duran?
[42:19.610 --> 42:20.490]  Just Jewel.
[42:21.890 --> 42:23.270]  550 subs, thanks very much.
[42:23.570 --> 42:24.010]  Dang.
[42:26.350 --> 42:27.030]  Just Jewel?
[42:27.470 --> 42:29.750]  I feel like I played Griffpool with Just Jewel.
[42:29.930 --> 42:30.730]  The musician?
[42:33.570 --> 42:34.030]  Same birthday.
[42:35.450 --> 42:37.770]  Mark the Frog is going charter fishing tomorrow, Geoff.
[42:37.870 --> 42:38.770]  Yeah, he's going with his dad.
[42:38.950 --> 42:39.150]  Okay.
[42:39.150 --> 42:39.190]  Okay.
[42:40.530 --> 42:42.250]  I thought I was up on Mark the Frog.
[42:42.250 --> 42:44.710]  I was like, thanks for rubbing it in that your dad's still alive.
[42:44.850 --> 42:45.430]  Appreciate it.
[42:46.550 --> 42:48.210]  I'd like to go fishing with my dad.
[42:49.130 --> 42:49.890]  Oh, man.
[42:50.070 --> 42:51.150]  Go fishing in Valhalla.
[42:52.670 --> 42:53.870]  What's the difference between this?
[42:54.010 --> 42:54.810]  Oh, the whole team?
[42:55.330 --> 42:57.210]  Oh, fucking suck them off.
[42:58.050 --> 42:59.550]  Oh, that's good, though, isn't it?
[42:59.690 --> 43:01.310]  Should I creep myself or them, Geoff?
[43:02.350 --> 43:03.150]  Creep yourself.
[43:04.670 --> 43:06.310]  Why would you creep yourself?
[43:06.310 --> 43:07.790]  He doesn't want to go to the Bad Star.
[43:07.890 --> 43:08.810]  Oh, I see, I see, I see.
[43:11.750 --> 43:12.390]  I mean, I don't...
[43:14.210 --> 43:14.590]  What's that?
[43:14.670 --> 43:15.190]  What are you thinking, Andrew?
[43:16.790 --> 43:19.330]  I mean, he's going to be the next one to get there.
[43:19.510 --> 43:22.130]  A lot of opinions from a guy who...
[43:22.770 --> 43:23.050]  sucks.
[43:24.890 --> 43:27.050]  Dude, just fell apart.
[43:27.490 --> 43:29.290]  I was going to say a guy who doesn't have a star,
[43:29.570 --> 43:31.110]  but then I saw he had a star.
[43:33.230 --> 43:34.110]  Oh, my God.
[43:34.670 --> 43:36.350]  Buckled under his own weight.
[43:36.490 --> 43:37.470]  That was brutal.
[43:40.830 --> 43:41.230]  Sucks.
[43:41.690 --> 43:42.430]  What do you think, Geoff?
[43:43.830 --> 43:46.490]  Why don't you creep him?
[43:47.210 --> 43:48.010]  All right, let's creep him.
[43:49.110 --> 43:50.210]  Because I might need that pipe
[43:50.210 --> 43:51.330]  to get the goddamn out of there.
[43:51.770 --> 43:54.530]  Is it disingenuous to change...
[43:54.730 --> 43:57.470]  Thank you. Problem solved.
[43:57.870 --> 43:58.970]  I don't know what the question is.
[43:59.230 --> 44:02.530]  I was going to say to stop being a fan
[44:02.530 --> 44:04.130]  of a team and root for another team now.
[44:04.310 --> 44:06.250]  Oh, no, I did it with the Tigers and the White Sox.
[44:06.490 --> 44:09.490]  I think it's a level of maturity.
[44:09.830 --> 44:10.590]  I'm thinking about
[44:10.590 --> 44:12.150]  abandoning the Cowboys because I hate them.
[44:12.270 --> 44:13.070]  Yeah, you should.
[44:13.290 --> 44:16.630]  At some point, Nick,
[44:16.710 --> 44:18.130]  you've got to look at how much of your life
[44:18.130 --> 44:20.650]  you have left and how much of your life
[44:20.650 --> 44:22.330]  you've already spent getting kicked in the dick
[44:22.330 --> 44:24.650]  by a team and how much more dick-kicking
[44:24.650 --> 44:26.890]  you want from that exact same fucking team.
[44:27.430 --> 44:27.830]  Hey, man,
[44:28.070 --> 44:30.090]  I'm not a Chargers fan anymore.
[44:30.090 --> 44:30.890]  There you go.
[44:31.390 --> 44:32.970]  I gave up on the White Sox.
[44:33.310 --> 44:34.850]  They're not in the town that you're from.
[44:36.890 --> 44:37.910]  I know a lot of people
[44:37.910 --> 44:39.310]  in San Diego who are still fans.
[44:39.550 --> 44:41.490]  Oh, you've got to catch the fish!
[44:43.010 --> 44:44.150]  We don't want a big net.
[44:44.710 --> 44:45.490]  Oh, yeah,
[44:45.590 --> 44:46.950]  because you want to catch
[44:48.030 --> 44:49.410]  just the good fish?
[44:49.710 --> 44:51.550]  We want to catch good fish, not spiky fish.
[44:52.390 --> 44:53.570]  Can you just click?
[44:55.490 --> 44:55.990]  Yeah, but
[44:55.990 --> 44:57.710]  it undoes your previous net if you just click.
[44:57.710 --> 44:58.650]  Oh, so there's only...
[44:58.650 --> 44:59.870]  You can drag.
[45:02.150 --> 45:04.050]  So this is a teamwork thing, huh?
[45:04.910 --> 45:05.570]  Alright, Andrew,
[45:05.730 --> 45:06.610]  we got this.
[45:06.810 --> 45:08.550]  Yeah, easy. This is easy.
[45:10.630 --> 45:11.970]  I see, they break through.
[45:12.190 --> 45:13.310]  Alright, Geoff, I'll manage the left.
[45:13.630 --> 45:15.210]  I'll go...
[45:15.210 --> 45:16.710]  There you go, see? Doing great.
[45:17.510 --> 45:18.150]  Alright, good.
[45:19.670 --> 45:20.890]  Drag down, drag down.
[45:21.050 --> 45:21.810]  Drag down, Andrew.
[45:22.370 --> 45:23.550]  I didn't get there in time, sorry.
[45:23.550 --> 45:24.330]  I got this.
[45:25.250 --> 45:25.570]  Nice.
[45:27.350 --> 45:28.650]  This one's mine.
[45:29.370 --> 45:29.730]  Nice.
[45:31.290 --> 45:32.250]  Uh-oh.
[45:33.550 --> 45:34.870]  We'll give you more time to think about it.
[45:36.290 --> 45:36.510]  Nope.
[45:38.070 --> 45:38.830]  I should have just...
[45:41.230 --> 45:42.750]  They got through.
[45:43.330 --> 45:44.090]  The gold one!
[45:45.450 --> 45:45.710]  Nice.
[45:46.450 --> 45:47.710]  Two gold ones!
[45:48.210 --> 45:48.570]  Wow.
[45:48.570 --> 45:49.530]  Wow.
[45:51.290 --> 45:51.930]  Sorry.
[45:52.410 --> 45:53.090]  Normal evil fish.
[45:53.710 --> 45:55.550]  Think about it.
[45:55.750 --> 45:56.330]  Time to think.
[45:57.070 --> 45:59.110]  Oh, balls.
[46:00.170 --> 46:01.150]  There you go.
[46:01.950 --> 46:02.610]  What a move.
[46:03.310 --> 46:04.770]  Oh my god, it's neck and neck.
[46:05.250 --> 46:08.030]  Just didn't make any move there.
[46:09.170 --> 46:09.710]  Uh-oh.
[46:10.850 --> 46:11.450]  Uh-oh.
[46:12.110 --> 46:13.190]  It's getting hard.
[46:13.470 --> 46:15.070]  They're falling apart on the left.
[46:15.830 --> 46:17.190]  That was a good get there.
[46:17.270 --> 46:18.290]  Oh god, maybe.
[46:20.190 --> 46:21.770]  Oh yeah, baby.
[46:21.790 --> 46:23.530]  They fell apart at the end.
[46:24.410 --> 46:25.250]  Team G going crazy.
[46:26.650 --> 46:26.870]  Damn.
[46:28.890 --> 46:29.370]  Balls.
[46:29.970 --> 46:30.630]  Damn balls.
[46:33.090 --> 46:34.250]  Stupid damn balls.
[46:34.850 --> 46:36.290]  That's what Gavin was saying that Christmas.
[46:36.570 --> 46:37.250]  Damn balls.
[46:37.970 --> 46:39.110]  Ho ho whoa.
[46:39.170 --> 46:39.870]  Ho ho ow.
[46:40.630 --> 46:42.750]  When is Geoff and Gavin going down to help Andrew with the headboard?
[46:42.750 --> 46:43.610]  Is that still there, Andrew?
[46:44.210 --> 46:44.990]  No, it's moved.
[46:46.610 --> 46:47.550]  Cancel the ticket.
[46:50.470 --> 46:51.270]  Mario time.
[46:51.290 --> 46:53.490]  Mario time.
[46:55.190 --> 46:55.590]  What?
[46:56.350 --> 46:57.310]  You look at me funny.
[46:58.210 --> 46:58.790]  I didn't say anything.
[47:01.070 --> 47:02.950]  Comments on the flattest sandwich video.
[47:03.170 --> 47:04.470]  I wonder who's going to win Mario Party.
[47:06.850 --> 47:08.650]  No, GURPS aren't sold out. We still have some.
[47:08.770 --> 47:09.310]  We do.
[47:10.390 --> 47:11.030]  Regulationsstore.com
[47:11.650 --> 47:12.290]  Regulationsstore.store
[47:12.290 --> 47:13.850]  Welcome to the chat, baby.
[47:14.650 --> 47:17.110]  Yeah, if you wanted to get a second or a third or an eighth or a twelfth...
[47:17.110 --> 47:19.170]  Yeah, now's the time. Now's the time to go crazy mode.
[47:19.390 --> 47:20.770]  Oh god, just take him right to it.
[47:21.110 --> 47:23.370]  Geoff, what's your opinion? Should I pipe out of here?
[47:24.290 --> 47:25.530]  Yeah, should Gavin lay pipe?
[47:25.710 --> 47:27.430]  Because I might end up just further down.
[47:27.770 --> 47:29.030]  I trust you. I think so.
[47:29.130 --> 47:30.090]  I don't really want to start at the beginning.
[47:30.270 --> 47:33.170]  I hope you get sucked right before it.
[47:34.210 --> 47:35.710]  You're going to lay pipe and get sucked?
[47:35.790 --> 47:36.210]  Yeah, dude.
[47:36.210 --> 47:39.210]  I'd love to get like 20 spaces back.
[47:39.390 --> 47:39.610]  Sweet.
[47:39.990 --> 47:41.850]  Damn it! Fuck!
[47:42.910 --> 47:44.250]  He's screaming.
[47:45.390 --> 47:46.070]  Screaming.
[47:47.270 --> 47:47.510]  Wow.
[47:47.990 --> 47:48.290]  Wow.
[47:48.810 --> 47:51.410]  Pretty awesome.
[47:51.670 --> 47:51.930]  Damn.
[47:55.510 --> 47:56.190]  Well...
[47:56.190 --> 47:56.810]  Hey.
[47:57.190 --> 47:57.950]  Don't know your own strength?
[47:58.210 --> 47:58.450]  Oh.
[48:00.970 --> 48:03.070]  Did they already make it?
[48:03.850 --> 48:04.790]  Tony mocked it up.
[48:05.090 --> 48:05.450]  Whoa!
[48:06.170 --> 48:08.770]  Tony mocked it up. Andrew, if you have time, you should go on Slack
[48:08.770 --> 48:10.250]  and look at what Tony just dropped in.
[48:10.530 --> 48:12.690]  Andrew, did you just see what happened just now?
[48:12.970 --> 48:14.690]  Yeah, I can't believe he did that.
[48:14.810 --> 48:15.910]  I can't believe he did that either.
[48:16.470 --> 48:19.110]  I piped backwards and then I spun the towel
[48:19.490 --> 48:20.150]  ready to go.
[48:20.290 --> 48:22.030]  Right, but you didn't go to boo.
[48:23.250 --> 48:25.070]  Oh, we have enough to steal.
[48:25.210 --> 48:25.930]  Oh, that's incredible.
[48:26.810 --> 48:27.790]  Geoff, make sure you get boo.
[48:29.390 --> 48:30.270]  That's a great...
[48:30.270 --> 48:31.350]  Isn't that crazy?
[48:31.470 --> 48:33.450]  Is that the next one?
[48:34.210 --> 48:35.750]  I think it has to be.
[48:35.810 --> 48:37.290]  Oh no!
[48:37.790 --> 48:38.470]  Yes!
[48:39.910 --> 48:41.190]  That's crazy.
[48:43.130 --> 48:44.190]  Have Tony
[48:44.190 --> 48:45.210]  mock up the cumbler.
[48:45.650 --> 48:46.010]  No!
[48:47.150 --> 48:48.690]  Tony, don't do that.
[48:50.150 --> 48:51.430]  Tony's too family friendly.
[48:52.750 --> 48:54.190]  So wait, did we got the
[48:54.190 --> 48:55.750]  good store on the nighttime?
[48:56.870 --> 48:57.250]  Sure.
[48:57.910 --> 48:59.290]  That sounded like
[49:00.290 --> 49:01.270]  Grandpa was like
[49:01.270 --> 49:02.210]  we have a problem.
[49:03.490 --> 49:05.150]  We got the good store
[49:05.150 --> 49:06.450]  on the nighttime.
[49:07.830 --> 49:08.850]  It's past my bedtime.
[49:09.850 --> 49:10.930]  I can't go there anymore.
[49:11.830 --> 49:12.790]  Bonus minigame.
[49:14.310 --> 49:16.150]  I can't believe how good that looked.
[49:16.430 --> 49:17.450]  We need to win this, Nick.
[49:17.590 --> 49:18.870]  Look how good the small version looks.
[49:19.450 --> 49:21.070]  When you have distance from it,
[49:21.110 --> 49:21.870]  it looks really good.
[49:23.130 --> 49:24.370]  Which one's stamp out?
[49:24.370 --> 49:26.150]  What if we just did a small run
[49:26.150 --> 49:26.790]  of Blur Blurs?
[49:27.210 --> 49:28.810]  Like 4,000 Blur Blurs.
[49:39.310 --> 49:41.150]  Okay, I see how to do this.
[49:46.000 --> 49:46.660]  You guys got it?
[49:48.260 --> 49:49.060]  Get him, Andrew.
[49:49.920 --> 49:50.800]  I'm getting him back.
[49:51.520 --> 49:52.060]  Andrew, fight.
[49:53.640 --> 49:56.200]  Andrew, get fucked up.
[49:56.860 --> 49:58.000]  There's like no green here.
[49:59.300 --> 50:00.600]  It's like half green.
[50:00.640 --> 50:01.780]  What are you talking about?
[50:02.620 --> 50:03.460]  Oh, no!
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.460]  Absolutely brutalized.
[50:12.850 --> 50:13.990]  Absolutely brutalized.
[50:14.230 --> 50:15.810]  I hate to say it, but I fucking bullied Andrew.
[50:16.030 --> 50:17.970]  You destroyed Andrew.
[50:19.390 --> 50:21.530]  Yeah, you destroyed him.
[50:21.750 --> 50:23.690]  He could not make a move.
[50:23.790 --> 50:24.910]  That was tough.
[50:26.370 --> 50:27.570]  Well, bollocks.
[50:28.770 --> 50:29.070]  It's fine.
[50:29.070 --> 50:30.510]  I mean, we can steal the coins back.
[50:34.050 --> 50:35.530]  Was that double coins, though?
[50:36.270 --> 50:36.750]  It was.
[50:37.050 --> 50:39.390]  Somebody said, what kind of punishment are we talking about for the loser?
[50:39.490 --> 50:40.690]  Do they get Nick's boots?
[50:40.770 --> 50:41.830]  Nick still has to wear those boots.
[50:41.930 --> 50:44.790]  We just haven't been able to go to the mall together yet.
[50:45.690 --> 50:46.830]  But we have an idea.
[50:48.710 --> 50:50.850]  This is the first time we've been together in a month,
[50:50.870 --> 50:51.630]  so this is pretty good.
[50:52.950 --> 50:54.490]  Has anybody talked to Nick about the idea?
[50:54.990 --> 50:55.170]  Nope.
[50:56.310 --> 50:57.110]  That's ominous.
[50:57.370 --> 50:58.430]  You have an idea, Nick.
[50:58.810 --> 50:59.610]  You're going to love it.
[51:01.690 --> 51:02.970]  Uh-oh, that booing.
[51:04.410 --> 51:05.170]  Alright, Andrew.
[51:05.330 --> 51:06.750]  We need some monies.
[51:08.290 --> 51:09.510]  If they get one more coin,
[51:09.650 --> 51:10.710]  they'll take our star.
[51:11.350 --> 51:12.190]  We can't let them do it.
[51:12.850 --> 51:13.670]  Oh, shit, look at this.
[51:15.230 --> 51:16.610]  What you got there?
[51:19.670 --> 51:20.270]  Shoot, why not?
[51:20.790 --> 51:20.970]  Yeah.
[51:20.970 --> 51:21.310]  Yeah.
[51:23.410 --> 51:24.890]  I like that.
[51:25.930 --> 51:27.450]  I don't like this.
[51:28.590 --> 51:29.010]  Geoff did.
[51:29.130 --> 51:30.410]  Oh, dicks!
[51:32.670 --> 51:33.710]  What are the chances of that?
[51:33.990 --> 51:34.970]  Oh, chance time?
[51:35.310 --> 51:35.750]  Do it!
[51:35.850 --> 51:36.110]  No!
[51:36.750 --> 51:36.990]  No!
[51:39.290 --> 51:42.930]  Oh, no. Oh, God, no.
[51:43.430 --> 51:43.970]  Wow.
[51:44.670 --> 51:46.590]  I can't be a part of this again.
[51:48.890 --> 51:51.230]  Oh, you both get to do it.
[51:51.970 --> 51:53.010]  Oh, no.
[51:54.790 --> 51:55.830]  Uh-oh.
[51:56.230 --> 51:57.230]  Oh, no.
[51:58.510 --> 51:58.530]  You ready?
[51:59.990 --> 52:01.230]  Let's let it roll for a bit.
[52:02.210 --> 52:04.230]  Oh, it's not at the same time.
[52:04.390 --> 52:04.570]  Go.
[52:05.590 --> 52:06.050]  It's a swap.
[52:06.670 --> 52:07.190]  Shit.
[52:07.550 --> 52:10.370]  This can only go bad for us.
[52:10.450 --> 52:11.970]  You can swap stars.
[52:17.110 --> 52:18.150]  Oh, my God.
[52:18.670 --> 52:19.110]  Yes!
[52:21.130 --> 52:24.970]  Dr. Bungtong, thank you for the five gifted as the coins get swapped.
[52:25.090 --> 52:25.930]  Oh, no.
[52:26.230 --> 52:27.870]  Geoff, that was pretty horrific, what just happened.
[52:28.850 --> 52:29.890]  You're the one who did it.
[52:30.090 --> 52:30.250]  Yeah.
[52:32.310 --> 52:32.750]  Incredible.
[52:33.170 --> 52:33.610]  Wow.
[52:34.450 --> 52:35.750]  Team shots sucks.
[52:38.610 --> 52:39.610]  Gerpler's still available.
[52:40.890 --> 52:42.230]  Your shorts, thanks for the sub.
[52:43.290 --> 52:43.970]  What do we got?
[52:44.410 --> 52:44.970]  Your shorts.
[52:44.970 --> 52:46.130]  Oh, what are the green ones?
[52:46.370 --> 52:47.690]  Oh, what are the green ones?
[52:47.930 --> 52:49.570]  You gotta throw salt on those.
[52:50.010 --> 52:51.450]  Move to right before an item shop.
[52:52.770 --> 52:54.690]  Call teammate, roll two dice, and move total amount.
[52:54.870 --> 52:57.430]  Items, stars, and space effects are doubled.
[52:57.990 --> 52:58.130]  What?
[52:58.630 --> 52:59.110]  Yeah!
[53:00.370 --> 53:05.030]  So, wait, that moves your teammate with you?
[53:05.130 --> 53:05.610]  I think so.
[53:05.970 --> 53:08.350]  So, you both go and get two stars?
[53:08.650 --> 53:08.970]  Yes!
[53:11.530 --> 53:12.490]  Oh, dear.
[53:12.490 --> 53:13.470]  Wow, that's crazy.
[53:13.890 --> 53:15.390]  Boy Gavin got dilled.
[53:15.590 --> 53:16.210]  Yeah, he did.
[53:18.510 --> 53:20.690]  I don't like that being the use of dilled.
[53:20.930 --> 53:21.290]  Yeah, that's right.
[53:23.110 --> 53:26.110]  What's your favorite verb usage of dilled?
[53:26.510 --> 53:27.550]  What's your favorite dilled usage?
[53:28.010 --> 53:29.190]  Generally, uh...
[53:29.190 --> 53:29.550]  Pickles?
[53:29.690 --> 53:31.370]  Good things? Positive things occurring?
[53:33.250 --> 53:34.970]  See, I don't like that verb.
[53:35.090 --> 53:36.950]  I'm more of like a trip guy.
[53:38.750 --> 53:39.730]  Whoa, whoa!
[53:39.730 --> 53:39.950]  Dill.
[53:40.910 --> 53:41.890]  The dill-a-teen.
[53:43.190 --> 53:44.350]  The dill-a-teen!
[53:45.130 --> 53:46.370]  Dill-a-teened is great.
[53:48.270 --> 53:49.630]  Dilled is a sexual term.
[53:49.690 --> 53:50.050]  What does it mean?
[53:50.910 --> 53:53.190]  Oh, that video's out now, huh?
[53:53.430 --> 53:53.770]  Oh, yeah.
[53:54.430 --> 53:57.150]  So people know about our prop.
[53:57.690 --> 53:58.090]  Oh, yeah.
[53:58.210 --> 53:59.810]  We can finally talk about it.
[54:02.210 --> 54:02.910]  Oh, no.
[54:02.990 --> 54:03.650]  But let's not.
[54:04.750 --> 54:06.390]  Oh, this one.
[54:06.390 --> 54:07.850]  Oh, it's lasso time.
[54:08.430 --> 54:09.550]  Oh, you don't even have to press it.
[54:09.570 --> 54:11.370]  The timing on this is such a son of a bitch.
[54:11.770 --> 54:13.010]  So you pull it back afterwards.
[54:14.650 --> 54:15.990]  You gotta pull back hard, Andrew.
[54:16.130 --> 54:18.910]  So the big ones, Geoff, we both need to go for.
[54:25.750 --> 54:26.750]  There you go.
[54:27.530 --> 54:28.410]  That's how you do it.
[54:32.760 --> 54:33.360]  Locked in.
[54:33.720 --> 54:34.680]  Let's go, Andrew!
[54:36.600 --> 54:37.620]  Billionaires rise up.
[54:38.160 --> 54:39.720]  Let's go for that huge one.
[54:42.080 --> 54:42.480]  Go!
[54:42.760 --> 54:43.080]  Pull back.
[54:44.880 --> 54:46.120]  Well, let me get the next one.
[54:46.580 --> 54:47.280]  Let me throw.
[54:47.480 --> 54:47.880]  Get it, Geoff.
[54:48.440 --> 54:50.460]  Hurry, Andrew!
[54:52.740 --> 54:54.660]  Andrew has not thrown his lasso.
[54:54.780 --> 54:55.280]  Look at him go.
[54:57.100 --> 54:59.460]  Alright, next big one, Geoff.
[55:00.760 --> 55:01.420]  Next big one.
[55:01.460 --> 55:03.440]  Give me something for the love of God!
[55:03.800 --> 55:04.320]  Next big one.
[55:04.660 --> 55:05.460]  Go, Andrew!
[55:09.580 --> 55:11.160]  Neither one of them is throwing.
[55:11.280 --> 55:11.820]  Come on, Andrew!
[55:13.280 --> 55:13.700]  Geoff, that one!
[55:14.940 --> 55:16.620]  Pick up the fucking...
[55:16.620 --> 55:17.440]  I messed it up.
[55:17.460 --> 55:18.760]  No, this one.
[55:20.380 --> 55:22.320]  Go, Andrew!
[55:23.540 --> 55:24.940]  Not even close.
[55:25.020 --> 55:25.500]  Get the next one.
[55:26.860 --> 55:27.340]  Not that one.
[55:29.800 --> 55:30.520]  That one, Geoff.
[55:31.280 --> 55:31.660]  Yes!
[55:31.660 --> 55:32.160]  Give me more!
[55:34.120 --> 55:35.700]  This one now!
[55:39.580 --> 55:40.940]  It's gonna be tied!
[55:42.080 --> 55:44.080]  How did we not pull it?
[55:44.420 --> 55:44.840]  Tied.
[55:46.000 --> 55:46.640]  What a tie!
[55:47.080 --> 55:48.000]  That felt like bullshit.
[55:50.040 --> 55:52.680]  Thank you, your knucklebox jocks.
[55:52.980 --> 55:54.240]  Your uncle Bob X.
[55:55.700 --> 55:56.580]  Knucklebox jocks.
[55:57.760 --> 55:58.780]  I can read that fine.
[55:59.700 --> 56:00.200]  Knucklebox.
[56:01.200 --> 56:02.820]  I can't believe you guys tied
[56:02.820 --> 56:04.820]  for how bad Andrew was at that game.
[56:05.020 --> 56:06.880]  Dude, it wasn't my fault!
[56:07.040 --> 56:07.900]  I was doing the thing!
[56:08.440 --> 56:10.520]  30 seconds just spinning that thing.
[56:10.520 --> 56:11.640]  He was edging the whole time.
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.560]  Andrew, would you say you dulled it there?
[56:14.300 --> 56:14.600]  No!
[56:16.540 --> 56:17.040]  Hello!
[56:18.520 --> 56:18.760]  Hi!
[56:21.520 --> 56:22.620]  Thanks, Kyle Vulti.
[56:28.780 --> 56:28.960]  Hi!
[56:31.260 --> 56:33.200]  Can I have a...
[56:33.200 --> 56:35.200]  Y'all are loud. Holy smokes.
[56:35.380 --> 56:36.200]  I did it!
[56:36.280 --> 56:37.220]  I dulled it!
[56:37.800 --> 56:38.920]  I dulled it!
[56:40.640 --> 56:42.780]  I did what you did in the middle of my reappointment!
[56:43.420 --> 56:44.080]  Way to go, man!
[56:45.140 --> 56:46.040]  Way to go, man!
[56:46.340 --> 56:48.520]  You gave him so much shit during that!
[56:48.740 --> 56:49.060]  I know!
[56:49.780 --> 56:51.340]  Only an idiot would do that!
[56:52.160 --> 56:53.900]  Andrew, son of a bitch!
[56:54.120 --> 56:55.360]  I'm gonna use the double dice.
[56:55.360 --> 56:56.500]  Yeah, go ahead.
[56:56.640 --> 56:58.220]  A lot of idiot flags in the chat.
[56:58.840 --> 57:00.100]  Gavin, drop the dill!
[57:03.180 --> 57:03.580]  Yes!
[57:06.140 --> 57:07.700]  We're getting booed to oblivion.
[57:09.320 --> 57:09.780]  Yeah, we are.
[57:11.760 --> 57:12.620]  Son of a bitch.
[57:13.980 --> 57:14.720]  We want this, yeah?
[57:17.440 --> 57:17.840]  Yeah.
[57:17.840 --> 57:18.680]  I don't even know.
[57:23.520 --> 57:26.360]  So if we had two stars, would it steal one from each of us or not?
[57:26.780 --> 57:27.420]  I don't think so.
[57:30.660 --> 57:31.380]  Well, unfortunate.
[57:34.600 --> 57:35.660]  Yes, yes, good.
[57:36.620 --> 57:38.320]  Oh, thank you NotReallyRichard
[57:38.320 --> 57:39.940]  for letting Ray's chat know that the
[57:39.940 --> 57:41.680]  Gerplas are on sale. Appreciate that.
[57:42.020 --> 57:44.000]  Good, now they can all go buy them.
[57:44.380 --> 57:45.940]  Come get your Gerply dregs.
[57:45.940 --> 57:48.120]  Instead of buying his cheap shit, they can buy our cheap shit.
[57:51.060 --> 57:51.900]  Oh, Nick.
[57:53.680 --> 57:54.100]  Tough.
[57:54.600 --> 57:56.120]  I'm guessing triples?
[57:56.600 --> 57:56.920]  Yeah.
[58:01.630 --> 58:02.710]  Okay, I lost it.
[58:04.250 --> 58:05.210]  Oh, it froze, okay.
[58:06.430 --> 58:08.150]  Will there ever be a mini-Gerpler?
[58:08.250 --> 58:08.970]  It's been discussed.
[58:09.110 --> 58:10.530]  We've discussed doing a Gerple Jr.
[58:11.470 --> 58:12.310]  Stop freezing!
[58:13.350 --> 58:14.150]  Or a baby Gerple.
[58:14.150 --> 58:15.990]  Oh, well...
[58:16.390 --> 58:17.530]  Oh, they were next to each other.
[58:17.710 --> 58:17.890]  Cool.
[58:21.290 --> 58:21.990]  But for now,
[58:22.110 --> 58:22.910]  Gerplers are still available.
[58:23.250 --> 58:25.450]  Yeah, but right now we can just get the bog-standard Gerpler.
[58:25.510 --> 58:27.650]  We can just get the regular Cosmic Gerpler, man.
[58:29.250 --> 58:29.830]  Uh-oh.
[58:30.250 --> 58:31.370]  So I can roll a one.
[58:32.310 --> 58:33.350]  Have a good time.
[58:33.510 --> 58:35.170]  Gerple Max would be the big one.
[58:35.550 --> 58:36.830]  We've already discussed how that would go.
[58:39.930 --> 58:41.330]  What is there to see here?
[58:42.210 --> 58:43.130]  Doom or doom?
[58:43.650 --> 58:44.850]  Well, we released the Gerpler.
[58:45.210 --> 58:48.010]  I think we need to release a Max,
[58:48.410 --> 58:50.090]  and then make a Gerpler Max,
[58:50.270 --> 58:51.710]  and then go back to just Gerpler.
[58:53.310 --> 58:54.070]  I like it.
[58:54.530 --> 58:55.690]  I think that's the trajectory.
[58:57.390 --> 58:59.750]  Should I just plow through with this mushroom, do you think?
[58:59.830 --> 59:00.530]  You got this, man.
[59:01.810 --> 59:02.890]  Just plow through with the mushroom.
[59:04.230 --> 59:04.550]  It's the best.
[59:04.630 --> 59:06.610]  Tony decided not to make the Cumb...
[59:07.190 --> 59:08.650]  The Cumbler.
[59:09.330 --> 59:10.450]  Is that the Cumbler?
[59:11.330 --> 59:12.510]  Wow, that color is...
[59:13.990 --> 59:14.860]  Cloudy and horrendous.
[59:18.270 --> 59:19.250]  That's really clinical.
[59:19.830 --> 59:21.130]  I'm going to use this word, it's clinical.
[59:21.490 --> 59:23.030]  Yeah, clinical is good.
[59:23.390 --> 59:24.370]  Clinical is a good word for it.
[59:24.410 --> 59:26.110]  It's like a Gerpler for sterilized needles.
[59:31.030 --> 59:31.310]  Oof.
[59:32.550 --> 59:33.050]  20.
[59:34.850 --> 59:36.230]  Enjoy some Labo.
[59:36.230 --> 59:36.330]  Oof.
[59:39.650 --> 59:41.710]  It's his fucking face.
[59:52.630 --> 59:54.450]  He's on the move.
[59:55.870 --> 59:56.890]  Ooh, Star Steals.
[59:57.730 --> 59:59.830]  I just really want to have enough of Boo.
[01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:01.790]  Yeah, just buy that.
[01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:03.290]  I'm going to buy this.
[01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:03.850]  Yeah.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.170]  Yeah!
[01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:08.850]  Why do you want me to buy it?
[01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.730]  Just do it.
[01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.450]  Buy that.
[01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.590]  Wait, don't do that.
[01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.030]  That'd be pretty useful.
[01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:17.710]  That's interesting.
[01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:20.390]  Someone at random you could swap with, like, Geoff.
[01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.190]  That'd be cool.
[01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.330]  Do you think we'll win enough coins before we get to Boo?
[01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:25.750]  No.
[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:27.290]  I think you will.
[01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:33.150]  If you want to do the Mario Party March move, it's buying the Star Steals that nobody can land on.
[01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.410]  Yeah.
[01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.390]  You want to fully go through with that.
[01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:39.970]  We really were relying on those, weren't we?
[01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:43.890]  Good story.
[01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.790]  Go right. Just avoid it altogether.
[01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:57.630]  Don't do that.
[01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:59.450]  We got it.
[01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:00.810]  Damn it.
[01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:02.930]  Alright. Oh, it's six!
[01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.130]  Oh, damn it!
[01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.210]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:09.090]  Geoff, where are you on the map?
[01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:10.770]  I think I'm...
[01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:11.710]  Andrew, you know what you could do?
[01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:13.710]  I'm just going to do it up to the right.
[01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:14.790]  I'm just going to throw this down.
[01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:18.930]  You could also double dice it and get to Boo and steal more coins of theirs.
[01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:20.510]  That's true.
[01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:23.190]  It's alright. Next turn.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.380]  Oh.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.620]  Oh, boy.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.020]  Now that's interesting.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:32.840]  Does that get us to Boo?
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:33.600]  It does.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.120]  Andrew, I know what you have to do.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.160]  Oh, no!
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:40.600]  Nick!
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.620]  This one's the one who said it does.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.220]  I was Gavin.
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.380]  You better max out on lodestones, buddy.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:49.000]  You listen to me on the other team.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.200]  You know what?
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.140]  That was awesome.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.160]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.920]  Geoff, we have to win and bum-rush Boo.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.400]  That was my fault.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]  It's both of our faults.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.940]  Should I do this?
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.220]  I want to be there anyway.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.920]  It's about fucking them over.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:08.940]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.100]  No, wait.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:12.680]  Who'd you do it on?
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.160]  Oh.
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:15.280]  That's fine.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.240]  Now just get the star.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:20.520]  Get a ten.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.860]  Oh, so close.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.740]  I think that's a chance time.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.220]  Do it.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.740]  Oh, God, not this shit again.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.280]  Fuck me.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.380]  If you guys win by chance...
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.580]  No, this could be good, Nick.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.440]  They could steal their coins back and we'd end up with more again.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.200]  Oh, that's true.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:39.880]  Oh, God.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.760]  Oh, God.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.680]  We just want it to go from them to us.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.040]  No!
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.420]  It's you.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.080]  Sorry.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.840]  Nothing even happened.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.000]  I know, I'd scream now.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.600]  Oh, this is bad.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:55.980]  You know what to do.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.740]  I'll take it.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.120]  Still not enough for Boo.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.920]  We're going to be one short.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:10.620]  They might be one short, but you can go to the store and you can get a Gerpler.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.200]  That's one for you right now.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.500]  Regulationstore.com
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.440]  Regulationstore.store
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.300]  Still there.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.580]  Almost an hour of gups.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.080]  Insane. Crazy.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.080]  We found our number.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.900]  We found a perfect amount.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.760]  It just took us four years.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.440]  Stuffy stacker.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.340]  Oh, boy.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:30.800]  We stuffing shit.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:31.920]  Play with mouse, of course.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.180]  Balls.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.920]  Pilot plushies.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.980]  The tallest tower.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:40.400]  Ah!
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.680]  How'd you get that?
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.800]  Oh, this is tricky towers.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.120]  This is tricky towers.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.920]  Is it like physics-y?
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:51.860]  Oh, dear.
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:52.840]  Seems like it.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.540]  Maybe we should save the giant Yoshi until the end.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:58.880]  Yeah.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.000]  No.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.560]  You don't really get a sense of how big it's going to be
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.700]  until you pick it up.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:06.360]  Oh, do you think you can twist it?
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.160]  Oh, God, yes.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:10.920]  You go ahead.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.640]  There you go.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.200]  Insane move.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.360]  Do you want me to put this in between it?
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.340]  No, it's too late.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.100]  Oh, there you go.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.660]  Why, if it falls, you can just pick it up, can't you?
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:32.540]  I don't know.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:35.760]  Oh, shit.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:36.940]  That's bad.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.880]  Catch it.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960]  These are our support.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:42.880]  Fuck!
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.440]  I really don't like this.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:47.980]  Hey, hey.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.360]  Plan G.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.740]  You don't got nothing to worry about.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.380]  You don't have anything to worry.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.600]  Where did our Yoshi go?
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:56.700]  You guys are good.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.440]  We just lost...
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.000]  Yoshi's gone.
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:02.540]  Oh, he's back.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.500]  You guys are good.
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.280]  Fall apart!
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.160]  Oh, shit. Almost fell down.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.880]  You would have been fine.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.320]  It's hard to rotate that shit.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.360]  That was brutal.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.200]  We got some coins.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.120]  We got some coins for Boo.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.840]  Alright, Andrew, you know what we gotta do.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.000]  You know what to do.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.600]  What are we doing?
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.320]  The gameplay keeps freezing,
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.280]  but strangely, your camp feed is consistent.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.740]  Maybe refresh game feed?
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.060]  It's not the game feed.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.440]  It is the actual game.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.580]  It's not the feed.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.180]  The actual game is freezing.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.120]  Yeah, because it's not like continuing without it.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.900]  Yes, so just be aware.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.480]  When you see that, that's what's happening.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:48.620]  Just be aware that you're wrong.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.200]  I just wanted you to know what was going on.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.680]  We've got a lot of choice.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:59.240]  Are you saying that our face cam is freezing
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.360]  at the same time as the game?
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.700]  No, they're saying that the face cam kept going.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.460]  That's what they're saying.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.620]  Weirdly, it wasn't doing that.
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.460]  Are the gerblers sold out now?
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.260]  I don't think so.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:11.520]  You could check yourself at regulationstore.com
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.820]  or regulationstore.store.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.060]  It's crazy. You ask before going.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.140]  But they are not sold out.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.360]  They're still there, Gavin.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.580]  Four minutes away.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.300]  Well, if you do want to miss out on this Mario Party,
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.460]  you can go watch us flatten a sandwich.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.180]  One! One! One! One!
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.560]  One! One! One!
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:29.980]  No!
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.340]  This is no good for us.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.140]  This is the worst case scenario.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:37.720]  Excellent.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.320]  We'll get it won by the star.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:41.620]  The other one.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:48.360]  Well, we can't afford the real star,
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.220]  but that's okay.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.800]  We'll just do some women.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.360]  I'm really worried about...
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.720]  I think we both used the double dice, Nick,
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.960]  and then we used the double move block.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.280]  Yeah, I'm most worried
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.640]  about that green dice.
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.220]  Do you think it costs double to buy it, though?
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.840]  Oh, yes!
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.360]  Are you not doing a 501 stream later?
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.500]  No, this is the only stream today.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:14.740]  Yeah, no 501 today.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.640]  Turns out the best time of this week
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.440]  is just whenever...
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.080]  It's GURP o'clock!
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.540]  But if you haven't seen it,
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.000]  watch the flattest sandwich at 4 o'clock,
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.360]  and then you'll get your little fix.
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.700]  Watch it as many times as it takes to get you
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:28.840]  to get to 501.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.820]  Thank you guys for being here on a Friday with us.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.680]  We appreciate it.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.260]  Thanks so much for all the GURP support.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.760]  Yeah, the GURP support's been incredible.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.640]  This is what we've always been hoping for with GURPlers,
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.640]  is that we have enough that everyone
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.660]  can get one, and it doesn't have to be a sellout
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.500]  in four minutes. It's crazy!
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.220]  Oh, wow, they sold out so fast! That's so awesome!
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.300]  But we want people to have them. I'd rather have people
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.440]  have them than they sell out in four minutes.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.100]  Because that way, when you're on the Australian news,
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.900]  you can have it in front of you.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.740]  Or you can have it behind you so far away
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.980]  you can't even tell what it is.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.140]  Nice.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.860]  Money mole! Roll a one.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.340]  That is an unfortunate time to be there, Geoff.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.020]  One. Yeah.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.440]  One. One. One. One. One.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.240]  Oh, fuck.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.440]  Oh, no.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.160]  Wait, it's gonna flip the tower. Shit. Yeah, it's a problem.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.540]  Even if we don't get the star?
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.560]  Yes! Oh, wow.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.400]  Oh. Hi.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.000]  Pretty sure, at least.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.660]  Crazy. Love it.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.280]  If you want to spin the tower back,
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.560]  you can land on my coin steal.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:51.120]  Oh.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.480]  What's he gonna get?
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.600]  Something good.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.900]  Anyone know what this number two next to my name is?
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.720]  What is that? Is that you've been...
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.440]  for two years or something?
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.420]  I don't know what that means.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.180]  Scroll over it with somebody on a desktop.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.100]  Oh, that's pretty good, Geoff.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.200]  Yeah, that worked out well for you.
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.160]  Well done. Well played.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.280]  It's a vote in the poll?
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.620]  You voted in a poll? Is there a poll here?
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:19.680]  What's the poll?
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.880]  We probably had them when we were taking bets
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.700]  on who would screw something up.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.500]  Oh, I see. Nice.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.960]  Oh, you predicted that it wouldn't sell out.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.420]  Oh, congratulations. Good prediction.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.160]  Good for you.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:35.620]  Alright.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.140]  We're one minute away from lasting an hour.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:39.980]  Wow.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.040]  Gatekeepers.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:44.300]  Oh, is this the key one?
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.600]  I think so.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.220]  Oh, balls.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.020]  I don't think I've ever done well with this one.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.180]  I'm so happy you're so happy, LikelyLenny.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.700]  As a matter of fact, if you wanted to get another one, you can right now
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:55.940]  because they are still in stock.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.680]  We finally ordered enough.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.040]  Now you've got your GURP, you can gift GURP.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.980]  An hour. Give the gift to GURP.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.880]  An hour. We did it!
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:05.760]  Gavin, we did it.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.160]  We did it.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.280]  It's hard to tell how many remain, but I'd say somewhere in the...
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:09.780]  At least one.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:13.900]  Somewhere in the ones.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.960]  CaptainPatad with five gifted subs.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.420]  Thank you so much.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.920]  Probably a little over...
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.340]  More than a thousand more left, I think.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:21.800]  Wow.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.500]  Alright, lock in...
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:25.880]  Moleman.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:27.860]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.040]  I was saying BooEarns.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.100]  Alright, this is bullshit.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:33.740]  Yep.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.740]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.600]  Oh, that's right.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.380]  Let me feel the Dill Energy.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.200]  Let me feel what's in the air.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.140]  Oh, I'm getting the Dill up.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.180]  Dill time, baby. DILL TIME.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.020]  Dill-ogy.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.600]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.380]  Oh.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.620]  I don't know what I was sensing.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:57.820]  I've never seen that happen.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.760]  Unless it's you.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.260]  You gotta go that one. Nah, shit.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.200]  Alright, well bye!
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:10.280]  Sure... uh oh.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:13.920]  You know what?
[01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:21.490]  Statistically. YES!
[01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:23.930]  Statistically, that didn't...
[01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.530]  It was better than the other ones. It was better than the other ones, but I mean...
[01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:27.990]  It wasn't a guarantee. Statistically.
[01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:29.070]  No, but statistically.
[01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.070]  Yeah, statistically. Yeah.
[01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:34.110]  You're not thinking about the statistics.
[01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.710]  Yeah.
[01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:38.230]  Got it.
[01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:41.970]  Shit. That's okay.
[01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:44.210]  I'm conjuring my senses
[01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:45.390]  from the Dilliverse.
[01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:47.470]  Okay. And it says...
[01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.930]  Come on, Dill!
[01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:50.290]  Oh, balls. Okay.
[01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:53.910]  Oh, they got rid of it.
[01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.930]  Oh, they did.
[01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:56.770]  Geoff, it's that one for sure.
[01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:01.970]  Oh, that's looking nice.
[01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:03.870]  Oh, no!
[01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.670]  Alright, it's down to this.
[01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:07.950]  Rub my belly on the way out.
[01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:10.830]  Oh, boy. Could be this one.
[01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:13.310]  Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, pick that one.
[01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:17.930]  Good. Square or triangle, Geoff?
[01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:20.330]  Well, it's definitely not triangle, is it?
[01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:21.410]  Square.
[01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.630]  Oh. I don't know.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:27.720]  Come on!
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:28.580]  Miss!
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.460]  It froze into fire!
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:32.900]  Yeah!
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.700]  That was crazy.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.200]  Well, Andrew.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.180]  Triangle time.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.060]  Oh, they took that key away.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.900]  If I buy another Gerpler, can I add it to my order from earlier?
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.340]  You should email the store and ask.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.980]  Because we, unfortunately, don't know.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.220]  But if you reach out, we might be able to do it.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.100]  Damn.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.060]  Well, well, well.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.700]  Stuck in the cemetery.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.220]  What time did the stream start?
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.240]  1230.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.280]  1230, and then we put the Gerps on at 1.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.200]  So, we've been going for about an hour and a half.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.380]  The patch 3-pack sold out, but you can still get the individual patches.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.780]  You can make your own 3-pack, if you like.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.180]  Ooh!
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.360]  There are four patches, though.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:14.280]  Because we understand not everybody wants every patch.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:15.620]  Exactly.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.160]  They're getting mighty close to boo money.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.080]  Uh-oh.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.940]  Boo money's goo money.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:25.800]  Uh-oh.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.560]  Snuff Bumble said, I asked the store, they said they can't combine orders.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.220]  There you go.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.820]  See, Snuff Bumble asked the store.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.240]  So, how close are you guys to using that double-dice thing that you have?
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.180]  That's true.
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.940]  Well, we've got to get past Boo there now.
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:39.740]  You don't want to use it.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.520]  I'm a little nervous to utilize it.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.900]  Yeah, I would be nervous if I were you, too.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.280]  Ooh, here we go.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:47.560]  Yes!
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:48.720]  Oh, Andrew.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:49.940]  That's great.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.200]  You'll be good for the bonus stars.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.920]  Yeah, you're past Boo there.
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:54.820]  Awesome.
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:56.460]  Pretty cool.
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:13:59.740]  You could.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.920]  I thought Eric was in a bad mood, Geoff.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:02.460]  No, I'm not in a bad mood.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.180]  Geoff has been in the mood the whole time.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.540]  I've been in a great mood. I'm in a fun mood.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.280]  Oh, shit. I don't know what...
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:09.880]  Oh, God.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.480]  What are you going to do, bud?
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.400]  I mean, there's a lot of danger.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.480]  We're on turn 13 of 15.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.700]  I'm going to roll just normal.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:20.700]  Okay.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.760]  Why don't you use the triple dice?
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.220]  Normal roll?
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.960]  I mean, danger's all around.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.320]  Triple dice will probably get me past the tower turn,
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.140]  but I don't want to turn the tower with my actual body.
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.240]  I don't want to turn the tower.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.220]  I don't want to get to the end.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:35.740]  Got it.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.180]  Punch it.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.600]  Oh, wow.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:41.860]  Ooh.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:43.580]  Uh-oh.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.640]  Oh, boy.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.000]  Oh, I didn't mind that.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.360]  Well, this is interesting.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.120]  Yeah.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:53.880]  No bad ideas.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.220]  You know what? I was thinking the same thing.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.880]  No bad ideas.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.320]  No bad ideas.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.200]  Rides again.
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.020]  No bad ideas.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:05.420]  Yeah.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:07.920]  What's that?
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:09.160]  Oh.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.400]  Wow.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.860]  Thank God you did it.
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:18.120]  This might be silly, but you guys talking about your CPAPs
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.500]  made me less afraid to go to the doctor,
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.600]  and I just got my CPAP.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.900]  Hell yeah. Do those sleep tests.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.700]  And get a doctor to fit it properly on your nose.
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.500]  Also, get your moles checked out, too,
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.000]  while you're at it.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:30.800]  Do I just go normal?
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.160]  I'm at the very beginning of the game.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:34.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:36.420]  Oh.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:38.760]  Oh.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.300]  Big roll.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.320]  Good spin, Geoff.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.380]  Thank you.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.220]  Take a look.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.240]  Have a nice little look-see.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.040]  Shit, really?
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.540]  Same here, I gotta get my CPAP soon.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:55.760]  Dude, we're all gonna be PAPPing.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:57.520]  Regulation Pappa.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.400]  You still getting filled?
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.380]  No, I'm good on the air.
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.980]  So you're sleeping?
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.560]  I'm sleeping.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.760]  Except for last night.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.200]  Yeah, he was editing.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.460]  It's so funny that you didn't sleep for shit last night,
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.540]  and I didn't sleep for shit last night.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.760]  If I had internet, we could've hung out and played video games.
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:18.600]  Yeah, last night I stayed up until, like,
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.500]  truck boys' hours.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:21.160]  Yeah, same.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.720]  I think it's air hockey.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.680]  Oh, yes.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.060]  Oh, my God.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.700]  This is gonna be crazy.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.860]  Oh, shit.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:33.560]  Oh, yes!
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:35.640]  Alright, let's log in.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.380]  This is when we lose, in the practice.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.960]  Good Lord. Goddamn.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.300]  It's fast.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.520]  It starts!
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.220]  I'm so excited to see this.
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:51.560]  Gonna need Gav to stop scoring on us.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:51.840]  Yep.
[01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.770]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:58.250]  Let's do this.
[01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.770]  Start.
[01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:02.730]  Oh, Geoff!
[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.530]  Fucking hell!
[01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.670]  Unbelievable!
[01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:06.910]  Okay, we're good.
[01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:08.990]  Oh, God!
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.180]  Okay, that was some bullshit.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.540]  That was unbelievable, Geoff.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.060]  Oh, shit!
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.200]  I'm going behind you. I'm going behind you, Andrew.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:22.740]  Okay.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:24.340]  Oh, no!
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:25.480]  Yeah!
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.540]  Yeah!
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.040]  Got 40 seconds left.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.220]  Get out of here, Gavin!
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:36.460]  Oh, God! Oh, Jesus!
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.980]  Oh, a bullet!
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:43.380]  Yeah!
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.360]  Another bullet!
[01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:00.990]  Oh, shit!
[01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:01.610]  It's tied!
[01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.810]  No, it isn't!
[01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:04.130]  14!
[01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:08.110]  4, 2, 1!
[01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:09.410]  Get him out of here!
[01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:10.650]  No!
[01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:11.910]  No!
[01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:13.350]  No!
[01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:18.150]  The freezing!
[01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:20.970]  The fucking...
[01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:25.070]  That was so crazy.
[01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.790]  Andrew!
[01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:27.430]  The game's breaking down.
[01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:29.130]  That was fucking great.
[01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:30.090]  We won.
[01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:32.490]  As the gurpler amount goes down, so does our internet.
[01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:33.570]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:35.130]  Oh, wow.
[01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:38.290]  I don't mind the freezing in some games.
[01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:44.930]  That's so crazy.
[01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:48.710]  All right, Andrew.
[01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:51.430]  Double dice.
[01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:52.250]  Oh, wait, no. Bad.
[01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:56.750]  I think you want to just do normal roll,
[01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:59.770]  and then I'll do the other double dice to try to get close to you for the final round.
[01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:01.630]  One.
[01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.510]  Oh, spin it.
[01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:06.010]  Oh, damn.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.740]  Yeah, I'm gonna do this.
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:15.140]  Keep myself a little bit of a distance.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.800]  All right, Wario.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.640]  All our hopes and dreams right here.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.360]  Got myself two cosmic gurplers,
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:25.320]  two koozlers,
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:26.580]  three patch,
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:28.220]  and a patch shirt.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.680]  And tickets to Warped Tour? What the fuck?
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.120]  Whoa, we sold those?
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.280]  Yeah, I don't know why we had those in the store, but we put them there.
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.200]  Wow, good for us.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:38.320]  So check out me first in the Gimme Gimmes or whatever.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.580]  Gurplers still on sale, too. Crazy.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:47.340]  Yes.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.260]  Guys, we ordered too many. This is bullshit.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.800]  I agree. Dude, even CamelSpiderDave is here.
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.460]  CamelSpiderDave with the sub.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.960]  Thanks, CamelSpiderDave.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.420]  It's good, it's good, it's good.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:19:59.960]  14!
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.420]  Nice.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.460]  Well done, Andrew.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.360]  That one was dedicated to CamelSpiderDave.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.200]  Oh, you guys are right next to each other, huh?
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:14.140]  See if it...
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:14.780]  Yes!
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:17.560]  Yes!
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:18.940]  Wow.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.440]  You want that? Yeah.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.900]  Oh, because you're ahead of me.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:24.940]  Makes sense.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:26.980]  Geoff, where are you?
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.920]  You're going to go first. You got those double dice.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:30.620]  You got it.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.620]  Geoff, see how many away from the star you are?
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:34.800]  How do I do that?
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:36.260]  23.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.440]  If you got...
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.440]  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Let's think about this.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:45.920]  No, don't think.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.460]  If you go by boo...
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.580]  No, I wouldn't use it,
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.520]  because if you roll low,
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.000]  you can potentially hit boo next turn.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.940]  This is turn 14 of 15.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:56.940]  Just everyone at home knows.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:59.600]  So maybe we'll save...
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:01.680]  Yes!
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:04.200]  Go to boo!
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.540]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.480]  If you go left, it's the chance for boo.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.680]  I would go left.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.400]  Are you going to have enough coins
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.580]  to do it on your next turn?
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.100]  We have 41 coins.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.280]  I don't want to be the one who makes the decision.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.780]  This just flips it around to make it the bad guy, right?
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:21.440]  Yes.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.040]  But then if Nick gets it...
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.240]  Nick's very close to getting the star.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.460]  So by me,
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.560]  it will be back to Bowser.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.120]  And we won't be able to do boo.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.460]  Yeah, I would do that.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:34.900]  I would do boo.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:36.880]  Oh, thank God.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.140]  That could have been so bad.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:42.660]  Right!
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:43.380]  Right!
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:45.460]  Oh, thank God.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.740]  Oh my God.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:48.820]  Wow.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:51.740]  Awesome.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.280]  Well, so next turn is the last turn.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.160]  This will be the second to last game.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.060]  This is crazy.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.100]  And if you're sick of watching this right now,
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.300]  go check out the Flattest Sandwich video on YouTube.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.740]  Also, imagine how we feel playing it.
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.840]  Are you ready, bud?
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:20.880]  Alright, Andrew.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:26.560]  Go, go, go!
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.500]  Go, boys!
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:29.620]  It's all...
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.780]  Andrew, you gotta go! Andrew, spin!
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.340]  If he spins, it'll
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:35.360]  fuck us over.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.440]  You're going to your too far left.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:39.960]  Stop freezing!
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.560]  Oh, you, Geoff.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.420]  Alright, go, go, Andrew.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.960]  Capture taking, capture taking.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.980]  Alright, Geoff, stop.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.980]  Alright. Go, Geoff!
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.040]  Come on!
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  It's alright. It's okay.
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:54.440]  Geoff, go!
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.840]  Nick doesn't want to go.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.320]  Yeah, you guys can win this thing.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.220]  You quit so early
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.520]  and it was like...
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.600]  These two guys?
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.420]  Hey!
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.400]  Nick gave up
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.120]  so early.
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:10.980]  You sure did.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.700]  Sorry, Andrew.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:14.840]  That's okay.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.480]  We need to tape this carpet down.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.860]  Oh yeah, this is the only carpet we didn't put the little rug
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.660]  catcher thingy.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:23.060]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.840]  Something to do this week.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.640]  I wish we had five more
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.380]  because then if I get the cardboard star,
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.120]  we can still boo.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.160]  Final turn.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.140]  This is it, boys.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.360]  This is the huge move, Nick.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.040]  Put those dice into play!
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:39.760]  Let's do it.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.220]  Wait, what's going on?
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.500]  So Nick is the one doing it here.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:47.120]  And then we should both move if we understand this correctly.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:47.420]  Okay.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.500]  Let's give it a shot.
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:51.660]  Uh oh.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.200]  Wow, okay.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:58.700]  Wow, huge one.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.880]  And here comes the monkey.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.460]  Yeah!
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.520]  And you got ten coins.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.140]  This is huge.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.260]  This is so huge.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.180]  Look at him watch.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.340]  Here we go.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.440]  Here we go.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.000]  Oh my, Gavin, how are you feeling?
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.200]  Two clouds.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:21.900]  Dog shit.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:23.300]  Floating on up.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.820]  I feel good about the Gerpler still being on sale.
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:26.300]  Me too!
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:29.020]  At least you're going to get to go to boo, maybe.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:31.600]  Stars.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.160]  Yeah!
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.020]  Yes, good.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.760]  I mean, they could have missed.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:39.840]  Yeah, we didn't.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.760]  Geoff should have flipped it to Bowser.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.520]  Oh, nice, Mario.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.220]  Oh, bye, Bowser. We'll see you later.
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.160]  Incredible.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.340]  Well, of the two decisions, I would say
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:24:59.700]  Oz.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.720]  The wrong one.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.900]  Let's just keep our money.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.640]  Oh, let's see.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.360]  Wait, do you have a
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.600]  coin steal to yourself?
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:12.620]  Awesome.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.700]  Give me half of my money.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:16.720]  Yeah!
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.160]  Yay!
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.560]  Well, we made one of the two decisions.
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.400]  He's back to where he was.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.460]  Oh, wow. That's crazy.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.320]  Alright, Geoff, you're going to use the trip on
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:35.420]  Boo.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.180]  I'll just do whatever.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.960]  I'll just do whatever.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:41.780]  Oh, did I spin it?
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:42.980]  Oh, shit.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:44.660]  No!
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.580]  Oh, thank God.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:48.500]  Wow.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.900]  I can maybe spin it.
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.480]  Oh, God.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.110]  Yay!
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:56.360]  Dammit.
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.380]  I could maybe
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:00.040]  spin it.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.140]  I could if possible.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.360]  Okey-dokey.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.020]  One.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.520]  Triple ones.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.620]  Here we go.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:14.100]  Alright, Geoff.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.360]  Think on it.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:17.580]  Geoff, you gotta want it.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:17.760]  One.
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.340]  Oh, my God.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.720]  Oh, thank God.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:25.580]  Wow.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.160]  Good roll, though.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.960]  That was a really good roll by you.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.200]  Steal coins.
[01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:40.670]  It made my heart rate
[01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:42.770]  It made my heart race watching him
[01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:44.830]  pick between the two.
[01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:46.250]  He was going to pick the right one.
[01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:47.110]  What's your ass rate?
[01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.230]  My ass rate's even worse.
[01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:51.190]  Through the roof, dude.
[01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:53.130]  It's my horse race.
[01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:54.910]  RateMyAss.com
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.020]  Yeah, go that way.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.880]  There you go.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:04.740]  Well, an interesting
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.540]  amount to end it here.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:07.140]  Very interesting.
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.580]  All tied up star style, baby.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.800]  Final minigame,
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:12.040]  boys.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.680]  I really like the
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.240]  tabletop
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:17.680]  Yeah.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.440]  Very different.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.720]  What's a shuttle scuttle?
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.060]  Are we avoiding the launch?
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.060]  Yeah, we have to cancel a shuttle launch at the last second.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:33.860]  Oh, this one.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:34.440]  Okay.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:35.920]  Oh, this one's toily.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.760]  Toily.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.000]  Yeah, there's no problem.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:42.800]  Alright.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:45.820]  Hit it, Wario.
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.800]  Let's do this thing. Last game, boys.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.340]  This is it.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.800]  All the marbles.
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.020]  All the damn money.
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.700]  Son of a prick.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:27:59.960]  Haha.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.760]  Oh, damn.
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.340]  Oh, no.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:11.480]  Mario's up there.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:12.620]  Dilkong's up.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.160]  Wait, who won?
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.660]  I think Gavin won.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.360]  I died shoving Nick.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:20.240]  No!
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:23.060]  People are already getting shipping emails.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.200]  Just so you're aware.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.460]  So that means that your label's printed
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:28.580]  and it should be coming to you soon.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.320]  Gurplas are leaving the state.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.340]  It's true. They're on their way.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.480]  State-tion.
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:35.700]  Ooh.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:37.680]  Alright, the star's pissed off.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.280]  This level was good.
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.780]  I liked how fast it was.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.300]  It was a very fast level.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.180]  It was like a 50-roll shot to the end.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.520]  I wonder how March will go next year with that one.
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:48.680]  Ooh.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:51.140]  Alright.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.100]  Here we go.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:53.360]  Here we go.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.230]  Show us how we fucked up.
[01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:07.170]  Oh, boy.
[01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:12.090]  Perfect diamond.
[01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:13.750]  Wait, why did we detach from the line?
[01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:14.310]  What happened?
[01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:15.930]  Incredible.
[01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:17.810]  Here we go.
[01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:18.570]  Shopping.
[01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:19.910]  Oh, shit.
[01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:21.490]  Who bought?
[01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.590]  Yeah!
[01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:24.710]  No.
[01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:26.950]  Feed the economy.
[01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:28.650]  Hell yeah.
[01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:31.790]  Remember when you skipped the shop?
[01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:33.730]  That could be the difference.
[01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:36.070]  Uh-oh.
[01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.630]  Yes!
[01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:40.110]  The game is yes!
[01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:41.950]  This is bad.
[01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:44.630]  We might have done it after that start.
[01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:45.410]  We might have done it.
[01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:46.410]  Oh, come on.
[01:29:46.690 --> 01:29:47.210]  Yes!
[01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:49.810]  No!
[01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:52.110]  We don't deserve it!
[01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:55.370]  Andrew, I want you to know...
[01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:56.030]  Sad day for the Dills.
[01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:57.450]  The Dills are dead.
[01:29:58.090 --> 01:29:58.610]  Incredible.
[01:29:59.650 --> 01:30:03.310]  I gotta say, you guys had such a lead and you Dilled so hard.
[01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:04.890]  That was...
[01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:06.310]  I can't believe that worked out.
[01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.710]  Botched that decision so hard.
[01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:09.350]  That's crazy.
[01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:12.570]  Geoff, I hope that improved your move, man.
[01:30:12.570 --> 01:30:13.750]  That's great.
[01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:15.650]  I hope you're feeling good now.
[01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:17.450]  I'm even happier than I was before.
[01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:19.710]  Plan G with another Dinger.
[01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:20.810]  Crazy.
[01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:23.670]  Against Andrew and BlankBlankBlankBlankHunter.
[01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:25.250]  It was pure Dill destruction.
[01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:27.710]  The shop was one.
[01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:31.170]  The shop was one difference.
[01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:32.970]  Let's look at the shop.
[01:30:33.130 --> 01:30:33.490]  What was it?
[01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:34.170]  It was.
[01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:37.450]  But we still would have won the other one.
[01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:39.670]  You would have had three and we would have...
[01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:41.770]  They would have picked something else.
[01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:42.650]  It would have been a whole thing.
[01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:44.330]  Look at these stats.
[01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:47.910]  We had the crown on so many spaces.
[01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:49.690]  Items, Bowser.
[01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:52.290]  Tower spin, chance time.
[01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:53.770]  We were all over the place, man.
[01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:54.870]  Hey, get over here.
[01:30:56.630 --> 01:30:57.030]  Wow.
[01:30:57.730 --> 01:30:58.330]  What a game.
[01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:01.490]  Guys, we did it.
[01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:03.850]  The Gurplers still on sale.
[01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:06.530]  What a day for regulation.
[01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:08.630]  Nick, you wanna kick us back over for the full screen?
[01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:10.110]  Thank you.
[01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:11.470]  Put your dick away, Gav.
[01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:14.530]  There you go.
[01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.710]  If you would like to see the
[01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:18.290]  ridiculous prop store
[01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:19.790]  auction that Andrew won,
[01:31:20.410 --> 01:31:22.290]  head over to the YouTube channel regulation
[01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:24.130]  pod and
[01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:26.150]  there's the Flattest Sandwich video.
[01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:27.590]  It's there.
[01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:30.630]  You gotta watch us flatten a sandwich as much as we can
[01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:32.170]  and then stay tuned for the end.
[01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:34.890]  Watch a little movie magic.
[01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:35.370]  Yeah.
[01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:35.970]  Oh!
[01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.950]  Guys,
[01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:41.410]  how do you feel about the launch of the Cosmic
[01:31:41.410 --> 01:31:43.570]  Gurpler today? I love it! So happy about it.
[01:31:43.810 --> 01:31:45.410]  People getting their cups, people are
[01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:47.010]  happy with their gerbs, it's great.
[01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:48.190]  Functional gut.
[01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:50.830]  This is pretty great.
[01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:52.210]  I'm really...
[01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:54.870]  I'm really happy with how this
[01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:55.870]  came out.
[01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:59.310]  10,000 was a good number.
[01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:01.670]  It's really worked out for us.
[01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:03.710]  Thank you guys so much for being here.
[01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:05.910]  Thank you for watching.
[01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:07.830]  Braxorman said, I want a hot dog count.
[01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:09.570]  You should listen to the podcast this coming week.
[01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:10.570]  Oh, you get it.
[01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:12.810]  We do final stats on Wednesday.
[01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:16.050]  So thank you guys so much
[01:32:16.050 --> 01:32:17.410]  for being here for this stream.
[01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:19.830]  Andrew, believe these
[01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:21.570]  folks with incredible words of wisdom
[01:32:21.570 --> 01:32:23.290]  so they know what is going on.
[01:32:26.090 --> 01:32:26.530]  Bye!
[01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:30.630]  Couldn't have said it better myself.
