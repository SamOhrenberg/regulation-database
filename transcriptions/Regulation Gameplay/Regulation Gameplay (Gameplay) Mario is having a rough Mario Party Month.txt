[00:00.000 --> 00:01.220]  Nick, Nick, what happened?
[00:01.860 --> 00:03.920]  I think Gavin just made an enemy for life.
[00:04.500 --> 00:06.320]  Let's see how interesting this is.
[00:06.380 --> 00:07.740]  Okay, you can steal coins.
[00:08.320 --> 00:09.800]  Cool. I know who to steal them from.
[00:10.140 --> 00:10.920]  I'm fascinated.
[00:11.820 --> 00:12.220]  Gavin!
[00:14.300 --> 00:15.220]  Oh my god.
[00:16.260 --> 00:17.560]  I gotta give it to you Gavin, that's pretty interesting.
[00:17.680 --> 00:19.140]  You think interesting is over with?
[00:19.800 --> 00:21.200]  Wait, why did you get to do it twice?
[00:22.140 --> 00:23.320]  Wait, why did you get to do it twice?
[00:23.560 --> 00:26.000]  Oh my god.
[00:27.020 --> 00:28.360]  Nick, Nick, what happened?
[00:28.360 --> 00:31.220]  I think Gavin just made an enemy for life.
[00:34.760 --> 00:39.160]  Well, I know who you shouldn't take it from.
[00:41.160 --> 00:42.260]  The opportunity.
[00:42.780 --> 00:43.880]  Let's let chance determine.
[00:46.340 --> 00:46.920]  Yes!
[00:48.540 --> 00:50.340]  Mario Party is the best game ever!
[00:52.560 --> 00:55.280]  I love Mario Party so much!
[00:55.580 --> 00:56.580]  Who gives a shit?
[00:56.580 --> 00:58.360]  Holy shit!
