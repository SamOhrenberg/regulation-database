[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  Nick, how you doing?
[00:01.220 --> 00:01.580]  WAAH!
[00:01.740 --> 00:03.220]  That's me, dipshit.
[00:03.660 --> 00:05.640]  I know, I'm scared. I was just trying to scare you.
[00:06.680 --> 00:08.060]  That, yeah, that's what you were doing.
[00:08.220 --> 00:09.200]  There's nothing in here.
[00:09.840 --> 00:11.000]  I think there's stuff up here.
[00:11.300 --> 00:11.900]  Oh, wow.
[00:12.100 --> 00:12.700]  Yeah, toss that down.
[00:12.840 --> 00:14.060]  Shall I bring the tray and the trolley?
[00:14.080 --> 00:15.020]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bring it in.
[00:18.340 --> 00:18.700]  What?
[00:20.780 --> 00:21.000]  What?
[00:21.220 --> 00:22.160]  Oh, I see.
[00:22.340 --> 00:23.840]  This potion's a love potion.
[00:23.980 --> 00:25.120]  It made me say things about...
[00:25.120 --> 00:25.760]  I broke it.
[00:30.140 --> 00:31.400]  What do we got, fellas?
[00:31.980 --> 00:32.320]  Nothing.
[00:32.780 --> 00:35.100]  I spilled love potion number nine all over the place.
[00:35.360 --> 00:36.880]  Does that mean we're all Randy now?
[00:37.660 --> 00:39.940]  Well, it did have me saying a love thing to Geoff.
[00:40.140 --> 00:40.400]  Oh.
[00:41.000 --> 00:41.780]  He touched me.
[00:42.780 --> 00:43.420]  I'm looking.
[00:43.740 --> 00:45.260]  Like, physically, he touched me emotionally.
[00:45.460 --> 00:45.920]  He touched my heart.
[00:46.760 --> 00:47.580]  Don't be pervert.
