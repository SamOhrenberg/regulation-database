[00:00.000 --> 00:02.100]  Gavin, how's it going? How's your day?
[00:02.240 --> 00:03.480]  Good, Andrew. How are you?
[00:03.740 --> 00:05.060]  I couldn't be better.
[00:05.520 --> 00:10.440]  I am very excited to play a new game with you.
[00:10.780 --> 00:14.420]  New game came out today, but I don't know if you're even aware it came out.
[00:14.720 --> 00:15.740]  We got a new Trials.
[00:17.020 --> 00:19.640]  What? A new Trials came out.
[00:20.080 --> 00:23.620]  Ubisoft, I know maybe, you know, Skull & Bones didn't work well.
[00:24.060 --> 00:27.620]  Things have not been maybe going as great as they'd hoped in recent times.
[00:27.620 --> 00:30.240]  But Trials is always a great series you can go back to.
[00:31.400 --> 00:33.960]  As you can see, new Trials game came out today.
[00:34.400 --> 00:36.740]  Mr. Trials. Oh, you schmuck.
[00:38.280 --> 00:39.960]  It's everyone's favorite game.
[00:40.580 --> 00:42.520]  New part. I've never heard of Mr.
[00:42.620 --> 00:45.160]  Trials, the deep lore of the Trials games.
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.820]  Oh, my God. Is this ratey boy levels of Trials?
[00:49.640 --> 00:53.540]  No, look at this, this is Ubisoft AAA, man.
[00:54.540 --> 00:55.940]  Look at that. Number eight.
[00:56.400 --> 00:58.640]  Fucking find this anywhere else.
[00:58.840 --> 01:02.600]  Dude, I'm a little concerned that the prompts is locked in.
[01:03.060 --> 01:06.900]  But, but, but, but, but this is my new dance now.
[01:07.160 --> 01:09.240]  This is mine. Do you need to make an account?
[01:09.560 --> 01:10.540]  What does it mean? Log in?
[01:11.140 --> 01:12.660]  I don't know. Let's click A.
[01:13.100 --> 01:16.400]  Oh, no. OK, just registers my gamertag.
[01:17.860 --> 01:19.620]  This is actually just a crypto miner.
[01:20.700 --> 01:21.620]  Oh, shit.
[01:21.620 --> 01:23.620]  It's like Crossy Road on a bike.
[01:25.040 --> 01:26.460]  No, this is Mr. Trials.
[01:26.560 --> 01:29.580]  This is very, it's an original entry in the Trials series.
[01:30.480 --> 01:31.940]  Let's see. How do I play this?
[01:32.360 --> 01:33.220]  So I hold A.
[01:34.820 --> 01:37.240]  And then it looks like it's got pretty good physics.
[01:37.700 --> 01:39.660]  OK, well, wow.
[01:40.560 --> 01:41.840]  Oh, I've been. Oh.
[01:43.120 --> 01:44.520]  Wait, what are you doing?
[01:44.980 --> 01:45.920]  I'm trying to figure this out.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.020]  You've only got one life left.
[01:48.760 --> 01:50.480]  OK, you got to take it slow.
[01:53.740 --> 01:55.020]  Three stars.
[01:55.580 --> 01:56.720]  Next gift.
[01:57.320 --> 01:58.920]  Oh, 100 points.
[02:00.620 --> 02:01.260]  Achievement.
[02:02.260 --> 02:04.200]  Complete level one, no spaces.
[02:04.500 --> 02:06.380]  Why are we back to here?
[02:06.880 --> 02:07.400]  What happened?
[02:07.880 --> 02:08.700]  Was that the whole game?
[02:10.320 --> 02:11.440]  What what happened?
[02:11.900 --> 02:13.200]  Did you buy one level?
[02:13.760 --> 02:15.680]  There's no way it's just one level.
[02:17.400 --> 02:19.020]  Maybe you just press the wrong button.
[02:19.800 --> 02:21.460]  Maybe, maybe redeeming the gift.
[02:22.740 --> 02:25.920]  OK, it's level one, two lives this time.
[02:26.280 --> 02:26.720]  Next.
[02:28.060 --> 02:28.860]  Play to win.
[02:31.260 --> 02:31.980]  What?
[02:34.000 --> 02:34.720]  What?
[02:37.460 --> 02:40.340]  OK, now.
[02:40.560 --> 02:41.240]  Yeah.
[02:42.000 --> 02:42.780]  What did I win?
[02:43.440 --> 02:44.380]  Oh, hell yeah.
[02:45.600 --> 02:46.500]  A new character.
[02:47.980 --> 02:49.640]  So we're going to click next instead.
[02:49.900 --> 02:50.900]  Oh, I'm already the hippie.
[02:50.980 --> 02:52.520]  I didn't even need to swap skins.
[02:53.180 --> 02:54.540]  How did you mess it up the first time?
[02:54.860 --> 02:55.780]  I don't know.
[02:57.140 --> 02:58.720]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:58.780 --> 03:00.000]  Hey, hey.
[03:01.420 --> 03:02.340]  And we're doing good.
[03:02.380 --> 03:04.740]  Look at that flawless and the lives reset.
[03:06.220 --> 03:07.540]  Target score 150.
[03:07.720 --> 03:08.620]  I don't know what that means.
[03:08.700 --> 03:09.860]  How do we get a target score?
[03:10.420 --> 03:11.580]  Zero stunt score, though.
[03:11.960 --> 03:12.340]  Terrible.
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.620]  OK, I got to get more coins to unlock.
[03:16.700 --> 03:17.580]  Oh, wow.
[03:18.340 --> 03:19.060]  My bike.
[03:20.040 --> 03:20.440]  Why did.
[03:22.660 --> 03:24.580]  Why are we back at the main menu?
[03:26.300 --> 03:27.140]  Oh, no.
[03:27.440 --> 03:29.220]  You have to play every level,
[03:29.980 --> 03:32.040]  every time you want to go to a new level.
[03:32.420 --> 03:34.480]  I don't think that it's intentional.
[03:34.920 --> 03:36.620]  I think you're goofing with the buttons.
[03:37.100 --> 03:39.740]  OK, OK, we're just going to speed run.
[03:39.800 --> 03:42.120]  We're going to speed run this next.
[03:42.700 --> 03:43.840]  Yeah, and then we're going to go forward.
[03:46.220 --> 03:47.980]  Oh, oh, I'm killing it.
[03:48.060 --> 03:48.820]  Look at that.
[03:49.280 --> 03:50.480]  Well, that was a great run.
[03:51.300 --> 03:54.780]  Next, I'm not even going to pay attention to what is happening.
[03:56.340 --> 03:57.580]  Oh, I've suddenly become.
[03:57.680 --> 03:58.380]  Oh, never mind.
[03:58.700 --> 04:02.360]  Oh, oh, oh, you have a checkpoint.
[04:03.620 --> 04:04.820]  OK, nice checkpoint.
[04:06.160 --> 04:09.920]  Oh, now we got to be careful because we we only got the one life.
[04:11.240 --> 04:12.060]  There we go. Yeah.
[04:15.470 --> 04:17.210]  We're just going to keep on trucking.
[04:18.330 --> 04:19.630]  Biking these four.
[04:19.970 --> 04:23.390]  I got to say, this is an interesting style choice for this trials game.
[04:23.990 --> 04:28.210]  You mean, OK, well, what?
[04:29.310 --> 04:31.450]  Yeah, we're back at the main menu.
[04:31.570 --> 04:32.410]  What is happening?
[04:33.310 --> 04:34.670]  Let's try this again.
[04:35.030 --> 04:38.130]  The achievement sending you back to the venue or.
[04:39.130 --> 04:40.350]  Did you even finish that level?
[04:40.950 --> 04:43.250]  No, I got halfway through it that it just kicked me.
[04:44.670 --> 04:45.970]  Let's see if it's achievement based.
[04:45.970 --> 04:46.990]  Is it a timer?
[04:47.710 --> 04:49.270]  There's no visual timer.
[04:49.830 --> 04:51.690]  I don't know why that would be the case.
[04:52.510 --> 04:54.030]  I think it might be achievements.
[04:54.930 --> 04:57.110]  Oh, oh, oh, my God.
[04:57.730 --> 04:59.750]  You're like a frickin helicopter.
[05:04.490 --> 05:05.690]  Oh, OK, let's see.
[05:05.750 --> 05:07.850]  Let's just go all the way back and spin as hard as we can.
[05:08.090 --> 05:09.030]  One, two, three, four.
[05:09.830 --> 05:10.230]  Perfect.
[05:11.370 --> 05:12.910]  Your head went through the ground.
[05:13.270 --> 05:14.090]  They're going to retry.
[05:14.090 --> 05:16.670]  So even failing doesn't send you back to the venue,
[05:16.850 --> 05:18.850]  but winning does or sometimes
[05:19.970 --> 05:21.090]  not winning does.
[05:21.210 --> 05:23.890]  Oh, oh, oh, I could have kept writing it out.
[05:23.990 --> 05:24.950]  I'm called bullshit on that.
[05:25.490 --> 05:25.930]  Oh, no.
[05:27.610 --> 05:28.310]  Oh, no.
[05:31.530 --> 05:32.330]  Oh, no.
[05:34.330 --> 05:35.010]  How do I?
[05:36.790 --> 05:37.630]  There we go.
[05:39.710 --> 05:40.630]  Quick B to reverse.
[05:41.790 --> 05:45.670]  Uh, OK, how did you even find this game?
[05:45.990 --> 05:46.530]  Get those coins.
[05:46.950 --> 05:48.590]  I was just looking at new games.
[05:48.910 --> 05:50.490]  Oh, what's that helmet?
[05:51.170 --> 05:51.930]  Golden helmet.
[05:52.330 --> 05:53.730]  Does that mean you won the whole game?
[05:53.970 --> 05:55.330]  The stunt score? I don't know.
[05:55.930 --> 05:58.290]  I you had to reboot your system.
[05:58.450 --> 05:59.770]  We're doing the Hitman three thing.
[06:00.250 --> 06:03.190]  Yeah. And I just looked at what new games were there.
[06:03.250 --> 06:04.630]  And I was like, oh, a new trials game.
[06:04.930 --> 06:05.830]  Mr. Trials.
[06:06.130 --> 06:09.470]  This game is a dollar twenty five cents Canadian,
[06:09.470 --> 06:11.570]  which means it's probably like ninety nine cents.
[06:12.550 --> 06:14.570]  Where's the achievement for beating level four?
[06:15.070 --> 06:16.830]  I don't know. We'll see if we.
[06:17.510 --> 06:18.570]  All right. There it is.
[06:18.690 --> 06:21.750]  You're right. Every every time we get an achievement.
[06:23.630 --> 06:25.510]  It's so a piece of shit.
[06:26.470 --> 06:28.370]  Yeah, you get a level five.
[06:28.630 --> 06:29.490]  Oh, no.
[06:30.450 --> 06:32.250]  Look at the names for the achievements.
[06:33.590 --> 06:35.290]  What? How does this stuff end up?
[06:36.470 --> 06:38.610]  You're getting real gamer score for this.
[06:39.470 --> 06:41.610]  Yeah, that's why it's fucked.
[06:41.750 --> 06:43.330]  Gamer score, unfortunately.
[06:44.470 --> 06:46.370]  Oh, cool. Used to mean something.
[06:46.550 --> 06:48.390]  It did. Especially.
[06:48.570 --> 06:50.650]  Oh, no. Oh, my legs.
[06:52.250 --> 06:53.510]  I bet you raised played this.
[06:53.930 --> 06:55.310]  I bet you raise all over this.
[06:57.370 --> 06:58.390]  Let's try it again.
[07:00.990 --> 07:05.350]  At these coins, get these coins, these coins, I want to get back me.
[07:06.790 --> 07:09.910]  Yeah. Line it up, line it up.
[07:10.670 --> 07:13.150]  Oh, a little bouncing, little bouncing.
[07:14.470 --> 07:16.110]  That better count. OK.
[07:18.190 --> 07:19.690]  Let's get let's do this.
[07:20.310 --> 07:22.590]  Oh, that was so much faster than last time.
[07:23.110 --> 07:26.970]  Was it? Oh, you France.
[07:29.230 --> 07:30.350]  France. OK.
[07:31.350 --> 07:34.550]  Wait, can I just I can spend another hundred and do it again?
[07:38.210 --> 07:39.590]  Oh, this is great.
[07:41.350 --> 07:47.290]  OK. What's an achievement?
[07:47.390 --> 07:48.270]  Let's look at the achievements.
[07:49.170 --> 07:53.110]  Complete level five, complete level 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50.
[07:54.110 --> 07:56.150]  Well, I'm guessing there's 50 levels.
[07:58.010 --> 08:00.550]  Oh, God, the next level.
[08:01.490 --> 08:02.830]  My my France bike.
[08:03.730 --> 08:04.830]  Oh, super cool.
[08:06.630 --> 08:08.710]  So interesting time to flip.
[08:09.450 --> 08:10.810]  Well, when you click a.
[08:12.590 --> 08:14.330]  It you spin.
[08:15.810 --> 08:20.010]  Like it's not like left and right trigger or stick fully controls everything.
[08:20.590 --> 08:21.750]  Oh, I don't get any sticks.
[08:22.970 --> 08:25.010]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[08:26.310 --> 08:29.830]  I think more effort has been put into like the fish in the background
[08:29.830 --> 08:33.230]  and the leaves raining down on you than the game.
[08:34.490 --> 08:36.010]  You see, you're not going to buy this.
[08:36.370 --> 08:37.690]  I probably. How much was this?
[08:38.050 --> 08:39.410]  This is like a dollar.
[08:39.890 --> 08:41.210]  A dollar for a thousand gamers.
[08:41.310 --> 08:42.250]  Cool. Maybe I will buy this.
[08:42.450 --> 08:43.610]  That's actually that's a fair trade.
[08:45.190 --> 08:46.690]  Uh, oh, my God.
[08:46.850 --> 08:49.050]  This is a we're really struggling here.
[08:50.310 --> 08:53.290]  How did I had one sec?
[08:54.230 --> 08:54.890]  Let's go back.
[08:56.130 --> 08:57.230]  Let's look at my achievements.
[08:57.790 --> 08:59.850]  What achievement did I get in the middle of the level?
[09:00.690 --> 09:03.870]  I got the complete the level achievement in the middle of the level
[09:03.870 --> 09:06.470]  that I was on and got kicked out while I was still doing it.
[09:06.530 --> 09:06.970]  That's great.
[09:07.450 --> 09:08.750]  I just wanted to confirm that that's what.
[09:08.850 --> 09:12.590]  Well, you got kicked out of level five by the level four achievement.
[09:13.070 --> 09:15.350]  Oh, I see. OK, there may be a level five.
[09:17.930 --> 09:19.050]  Yeah, I bet you.
[09:19.230 --> 09:20.410]  I bet you something's going to happen here.
[09:20.450 --> 09:22.670]  If you can do level six before you get level five achievement.
[09:25.330 --> 09:26.250]  Why? Why am I?
[09:26.250 --> 09:29.330]  OK. Oh, you're eating your own dick.
[09:30.790 --> 09:32.870]  OK. Here we go.
[09:32.910 --> 09:33.550]  Here we go. Here we go.
[09:33.590 --> 09:36.690]  Here we go. Pro run. Pro run. Pro run. Pro run.
[09:38.350 --> 09:40.570]  Oh, oh, fuck.
[09:41.070 --> 09:42.410]  I got one more life. Or is that it?
[09:42.850 --> 09:43.290]  Every try.
[09:44.850 --> 09:46.630]  Why is that achievement not popped yet?
[09:46.930 --> 09:48.950]  What the fuck? What was that?
[09:49.310 --> 09:50.470]  Maybe there isn't one for five.
[09:50.570 --> 09:51.170]  Maybe it's for ten.
[09:51.230 --> 09:53.850]  No, there's definitely one for five. Oh.
[09:53.850 --> 09:56.730]  Oh, this is.
[09:58.050 --> 10:01.610]  We've we've gone into some tough territory here as far as the controls.
[10:04.230 --> 10:05.790]  Do a bit of a lean back, lean forward.
[10:06.230 --> 10:07.610]  I'm trying. Yeah.
[10:08.830 --> 10:13.390]  Forward, back, forward, back, forward, back, forward, back.
[10:13.490 --> 10:15.630]  I wish I could attempt this level. It looks so easy.
[10:17.470 --> 10:18.490]  You want to buy it?
[10:18.510 --> 10:20.350]  We could swap over to your screen. Feel free.
[10:20.350 --> 10:21.070]  Take one.
[10:21.070 --> 10:24.630]  What's the thing where you can have other people control the same game?
[10:25.810 --> 10:29.090]  That's a PlayStation feature and not an Xbox one.
[10:29.450 --> 10:30.910]  Oh, what's co-pilot?
[10:31.670 --> 10:36.530]  Co-pilot is you and I could sync one controller locally.
[10:37.310 --> 10:40.530]  So you and I could both control one in the same place.
[10:40.810 --> 10:42.130]  Let's look at this achievement situation.
[10:43.150 --> 10:43.950]  That's a problem.
[10:44.530 --> 10:46.970]  Yeah, you got robbed. That's yeah.
[10:46.970 --> 10:51.270]  Uh, they made an individual graphic
[10:52.210 --> 10:54.610]  for that achievement, but didn't bother naming it.
[10:55.010 --> 10:58.390]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.
[11:05.230 --> 11:07.290]  Why? Why is this like this?
[11:07.910 --> 11:09.130]  What is this hellscape?
[11:10.110 --> 11:10.950]  Oh, shit.
[11:11.070 --> 11:12.270]  What can disable achievements?
[11:12.450 --> 11:14.350]  If you turn achievements off, do you think you would still do it?
[11:14.790 --> 11:16.610]  I don't think you can disable achievements.
[11:16.970 --> 11:18.130]  Or like disable notifications.
[11:19.170 --> 11:21.230]  Oh, how do I do that?
[11:24.010 --> 11:24.450]  What?
[11:25.510 --> 11:28.890]  Why did clicking levels just send me back here?
[11:29.370 --> 11:30.150]  This is level one.
[11:30.930 --> 11:32.530]  Yeah, I don't I don't know what.
[11:32.930 --> 11:34.190]  And we're not going to click levels again.
[11:35.070 --> 11:35.910]  Let's look at skins.
[11:37.490 --> 11:38.910]  Let's see what what we got.
[11:38.990 --> 11:41.330]  OK, we got a fire a firefighter.
[11:42.530 --> 11:44.990]  A pimp, I guess, is what they're going for.
[11:44.990 --> 11:45.690]  A cop.
[11:46.770 --> 11:49.830]  Geoff, they just put Geoff in the game.
[11:52.150 --> 11:55.730]  Our character, punk, cop,
[11:56.310 --> 11:59.170]  construction worker, robber, purse.
[12:00.630 --> 12:02.010]  And what are they?
[12:03.370 --> 12:05.250]  There's a person, I guess, person.
[12:05.770 --> 12:08.030]  Everyone else is like a fun role and they're just person.
[12:11.570 --> 12:12.770]  Clown glasses.
[12:14.430 --> 12:15.450]  Football player.
[12:17.010 --> 12:18.690]  Granny. That's the best one.
[12:19.170 --> 12:21.430]  Oh, I like him, too.
[12:22.490 --> 12:23.010]  Hippie.
[12:23.390 --> 12:24.430]  Are there so many characters?
[12:24.810 --> 12:26.450]  Oh, this is the starting guy.
[12:27.730 --> 12:29.650]  You think the bikes are just all flags?
[12:30.830 --> 12:31.570]  Country flag? No.
[12:32.390 --> 12:33.630]  Oh, it's the flame.
[12:33.710 --> 12:37.910]  We got America, USA, China.
[12:40.110 --> 12:41.870]  Leopard, everyone's favorite nation.
[12:43.430 --> 12:45.790]  OK, well, it's got to be the UK one.
[12:48.350 --> 12:50.530]  Well, it's OK, we'll get back to that screen.
[12:51.770 --> 12:52.810]  We'll get back there.
[12:56.750 --> 12:58.330]  Give me this gift.
[12:59.970 --> 13:01.270]  Let's play to win.
[13:02.290 --> 13:03.290]  Oh, fuck.
[13:03.610 --> 13:04.690]  Oh, fuck, Gavin.
[13:05.150 --> 13:06.070]  Oh, man.
[13:06.610 --> 13:07.810]  Easy. Now.
[13:10.830 --> 13:12.970]  Oh, wow, that was clutch.
[13:13.210 --> 13:14.690]  Oh, that was intense.
[13:15.010 --> 13:16.150]  China clutch.
[13:20.430 --> 13:21.030]  Great.
[13:22.130 --> 13:28.090]  I'm I believe a prostitute on a Chinese flag bike in Mr.
[13:28.170 --> 13:28.750]  Trials.
[13:29.030 --> 13:30.290]  Why is it a prostitute?
[13:30.790 --> 13:33.270]  I you don't think that that's what they were going for.
[13:34.930 --> 13:37.310]  I feel like that's what they were trying to deliver on.
[13:38.170 --> 13:39.130]  Zero judgment.
[13:40.570 --> 13:43.770]  But we got a lot of up the skirt on this character.
[13:44.010 --> 13:46.790]  Oh, yeah, let's get these.
[13:46.870 --> 13:47.690]  The coins are important.
[13:47.990 --> 13:50.690]  Oh, as soon as I go, there's no stopping.
[13:53.390 --> 13:55.170]  You snapped her hook her neck.
[13:58.370 --> 14:00.970]  Yeah, let's let's let's keep these coins.
[14:02.550 --> 14:06.530]  I need to grab I'm so dumb, I need to grab the free 100 between every level.
[14:06.530 --> 14:07.570]  There's no reason not to.
[14:08.010 --> 14:10.530]  Like this is clearly those free 100 coins.
[14:11.110 --> 14:12.150]  This is a mobile game.
[14:12.170 --> 14:13.770]  This is a free to play mobile game.
[14:13.970 --> 14:16.410]  And that is the ad that you watch for those coins.
[14:19.110 --> 14:23.710]  And let's just avoid the wood as much as possible.
[14:25.690 --> 14:27.550]  Oh, beautiful, beautiful.
[14:27.830 --> 14:29.950]  Had to watch an ad for like some in-game currency.
[14:30.310 --> 14:32.270]  Do you watch the ad or do you look away out of spite?
[14:32.730 --> 14:35.690]  I watch it because sometimes you can skip them early.
[14:36.530 --> 14:37.470]  What about you?
[14:38.150 --> 14:40.090]  I never look. Really?
[14:41.610 --> 14:44.610]  Oh, fuck. Now I got a timer on this free gift.
[14:45.430 --> 14:46.930]  Oh, and that's four hours.
[14:47.810 --> 14:51.090]  That's. Oh, Jesus Christ.
[14:51.490 --> 14:53.490]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[14:54.190 --> 14:56.070]  Uh, uh.
[14:56.890 --> 14:58.630]  Oh, this is cool. Wow.
[14:58.730 --> 15:00.030]  This is the true game right here.
[15:02.630 --> 15:03.330]  Bumblebee.
[15:03.330 --> 15:03.350]  Bumblebee.
[15:05.370 --> 15:05.850]  OK.
[15:08.150 --> 15:08.630]  Pfft.
[15:09.950 --> 15:10.490]  Oh, no.
[15:12.810 --> 15:13.610]  Oh, man.
[15:13.950 --> 15:18.310]  You think Eric would get mad if we bought the mascot of Mr. Trials?
[15:20.110 --> 15:23.590]  Are you just trying to see how many dog shit game characters you could acquire?
[15:25.150 --> 15:26.750]  Um, I mean, I don't know.
[15:27.270 --> 15:28.690]  Ruling isn't out on this.
[15:28.750 --> 15:30.370]  We've only played five levels.
[15:31.570 --> 15:33.130]  I think we got to consider.
[15:33.750 --> 15:38.370]  It's not even like they're using the same song for the whole game.
[15:38.470 --> 15:41.430]  They're using the same like eight bars for the whole game.
[15:42.190 --> 15:43.590]  More bars than we have.
[15:44.090 --> 15:45.710]  We don't even have a fucking intro song.
[15:47.050 --> 15:48.550]  We have four more than us.
[15:49.970 --> 15:51.830]  I think we need an intro song, by the way.
[15:51.890 --> 15:54.490]  I know there's some talk of like, maybe we just don't have one.
[15:54.550 --> 15:56.890]  I think we should probably figure that out.
[15:57.250 --> 15:57.670]  Let's get one.
[15:59.210 --> 16:00.990]  There have been some really good ones in the community.
[16:02.390 --> 16:04.730]  So maybe compile those and listen to them.
[16:06.310 --> 16:09.390]  And then there's someone who emailed me that was kind of the say, like,
[16:09.390 --> 16:10.210]  hey, I'm in a band.
[16:10.850 --> 16:13.510]  You'd use this song if you want to, or we could come up with a song.
[16:13.570 --> 16:14.670]  I need to get back to that person.
[16:18.900 --> 16:20.160]  So we could commission someone.
[16:24.710 --> 16:26.090]  This game is so shit.
[16:26.350 --> 16:27.470]  Oh, no, this is a great game.
[16:27.530 --> 16:28.010]  What are you talking about?
[16:28.030 --> 16:29.490]  Mr. Trials. Oh, sorry.
[16:30.870 --> 16:31.550]  Mr. Trials.
[16:31.550 --> 16:32.810]  I thought you were a Trials fan.
[16:34.750 --> 16:36.570]  Oh, that was a bad one.
[16:38.870 --> 16:40.230]  What are you doing?
[16:40.610 --> 16:42.670]  I'm trying. Oh.
[16:44.870 --> 16:47.270]  I want to get the level 10 achievement that we can stop.
[16:47.490 --> 16:48.830]  Oh, oh.
[16:50.790 --> 16:51.730]  Hey, we're retrying.
[16:52.570 --> 16:53.670]  Oh, there we go. There we go.
[16:53.690 --> 16:54.490]  There we go. There we go.
[16:55.150 --> 16:56.050]  Don't fuck it up. No.
[16:58.670 --> 16:59.330]  There we go.
[17:00.030 --> 17:01.730]  I was going to say that might be a problem.
[17:01.890 --> 17:02.830]  We're fine. We're fine.
[17:04.890 --> 17:05.430]  OK.
[17:07.670 --> 17:09.130]  Oh, that was close.
[17:09.950 --> 17:10.830]  Where's my checkpoint?
[17:11.870 --> 17:12.330]  Well done.
[17:13.010 --> 17:14.050]  Well done.
[17:14.330 --> 17:15.210]  Oh, there's no checkpoints.
[17:17.150 --> 17:18.210]  Oh, oh.
[17:18.410 --> 17:19.530]  Very nice. OK.
[17:20.090 --> 17:21.310]  Jesus Christ.
[17:23.010 --> 17:23.850]  What level is this?
[17:23.910 --> 17:25.390]  There's no visual indicator. OK.
[17:26.290 --> 17:27.150]  Who needs one?
[17:29.150 --> 17:30.730]  Oh, stay mount, stay mount.
[17:31.150 --> 17:31.550]  Speed!
[17:36.010 --> 17:36.850]  Oh, oh.
[17:39.470 --> 17:40.610]  Oh, new biome.
[17:41.690 --> 17:43.810]  Oh, that must be the level 10 achievement coming.
[17:44.010 --> 17:45.410]  Quick, beat the game before the achievement.
[17:45.610 --> 17:47.190]  I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm going to get it.
[17:48.830 --> 17:49.210]  No!
[17:50.450 --> 17:50.870]  No!
[17:51.250 --> 17:52.530]  It's funny every time.
[17:52.990 --> 17:53.410]  No!
[17:53.410 --> 17:56.090]  Oh, well,
[17:57.350 --> 18:00.290]  that was a short little video about Mr. Trials.
[18:00.610 --> 18:02.990]  Yeah, you got 5% through the whole game.
[18:03.190 --> 18:05.170]  Oh, oh, look at this.
[18:05.230 --> 18:06.690]  We now have this whole menu.
[18:07.690 --> 18:08.870]  I'm pretty sure you had that already.
[18:09.330 --> 18:10.430]  Oh, really? I just didn't know.
[18:10.530 --> 18:11.470]  I won't let me scroll.
[18:11.590 --> 18:12.790]  I can't see how many there are.
[18:13.130 --> 18:15.490]  Wait, which level did you get the golden helmet on? Level three.
[18:16.150 --> 18:16.870]  Level three.
[18:17.530 --> 18:18.930]  What does the golden helmet do?
[18:19.070 --> 18:21.170]  I guess there's 50 of them, one level per helmet. OK.
[18:22.310 --> 18:23.530]  Back to the skins.
[18:24.190 --> 18:24.670]  Yeah.
[18:26.310 --> 18:26.790]  Yeah.
[18:29.070 --> 18:30.810]  What does that plus 100 mean?
[18:31.370 --> 18:32.150]  In the top left.
[18:33.270 --> 18:35.170]  Am I supposed to be able to click that?
[18:35.330 --> 18:36.230]  On like a touch screen?
[18:37.970 --> 18:42.570]  But there's no, there's no way for me to get over than that.
[18:44.850 --> 18:46.990]  Because there's not multiple currency.
[18:47.230 --> 18:48.930]  Oh, no, I'm not doing this. I click menu.
[18:50.070 --> 18:50.870]  Oh, wait.
[18:50.870 --> 18:52.830]  I haven't even figured out the freaking menu.
[18:53.150 --> 18:54.710]  Oh, wow.
[18:55.490 --> 18:57.290]  Oh, this is a whole new game.
[18:59.250 --> 18:59.810]  Levels.
[18:59.990 --> 19:01.710]  That takes me back to there.
[19:02.110 --> 19:03.110]  What about levels now?
[19:03.590 --> 19:04.950]  That takes me back to there.
[19:06.050 --> 19:06.610]  Levels.
[19:06.650 --> 19:08.990]  There we go.
[19:09.470 --> 19:10.690]  What did you do differently?
[19:11.150 --> 19:13.190]  Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
[19:14.650 --> 19:17.530]  I can't even get back to the fun Mr. Trials menu.
[19:17.530 --> 19:20.990]  I think Ray has already played this.
[19:21.210 --> 19:21.690]  What do you think?
[19:21.810 --> 19:22.710]  We can check.
[19:23.450 --> 19:24.050]  Let's quit.
[19:27.890 --> 19:28.350]  Store.
[19:30.130 --> 19:30.950]  Did you see that?
[19:31.370 --> 19:35.870]  We got copyright striked by Rooster Teeth for watching 1-800-MAGIC and Ratatouille.
[19:36.050 --> 19:36.250]  I did.
[19:37.410 --> 19:38.190]  That's so funny.
[19:40.730 --> 19:43.470]  I guess we're going to have to take out all the 1-800-MAGIC.
[19:43.870 --> 19:44.210]  Sadly.
[19:45.330 --> 19:46.430]  Here we go, Mr. Trials.
[19:47.590 --> 19:48.110]  Or...
[19:50.350 --> 19:52.250]  I'm the only one that's played this.
[19:53.370 --> 19:54.770]  Buy it as a gift.
[19:55.070 --> 19:56.550]  Buy it as a gift.
[19:57.330 --> 19:57.930]  Give it to Ray.
[20:08.710 --> 20:11.510]  It's not going to work because it's a Canadian code.
[20:12.150 --> 20:13.070]  It won't work?
[20:13.570 --> 20:13.990]  No.
[20:14.670 --> 20:16.530]  He won't be able to redeem it.
[20:17.230 --> 20:19.730]  You're going to give him a shitty Canadian gift that he can't open?
[20:20.090 --> 20:20.490]  Yeah.
[20:20.870 --> 20:22.470]  Your gift is on its way.
[20:23.770 --> 20:25.530]  What a waste of $1.50.
[20:27.670 --> 20:29.530]  How is the Canadian dollar doing?
[20:29.730 --> 20:31.030]  Is it good now?
[20:31.090 --> 20:31.870]  Or is it still a piece of shit?
[20:32.370 --> 20:34.430]  Piece of absolute shit.
[20:35.230 --> 20:35.910]  But that's okay.
[20:36.210 --> 20:37.470]  We're an American company.
[20:37.850 --> 20:38.310]  It's fine.
[20:39.530 --> 20:39.950]  Bug.
[20:41.210 --> 20:42.250]  Jushatana Press.
[20:42.570 --> 20:43.090]  Successtress.
[20:43.510 --> 20:44.030]  Discredible.
[20:45.350 --> 20:48.210]  That's him complaining that it goes back to the menu.
[20:48.810 --> 20:49.630]  Two stars.
[20:51.670 --> 20:52.070]  Crashes.
[20:53.610 --> 20:54.130]  But...
[20:54.670 --> 20:55.430]  One second.
[20:55.530 --> 20:56.210]  It definitely needs an update.
[20:56.330 --> 20:58.610]  Crashes at each completed level won't let me open levels.
[20:59.130 --> 21:00.590]  They just haven't figured it out.
[21:01.110 --> 21:02.830]  You're sent home screen every level.
[21:08.130 --> 21:09.410]  Game restart.
[21:12.730 --> 21:15.810]  So I bet what happened is the guy making this game
[21:15.810 --> 21:18.510]  got all the achievements
[21:19.290 --> 21:20.910]  and then changed something
[21:20.910 --> 21:22.950]  and then tested the game again
[21:22.950 --> 21:25.710]  but he doesn't know it resets every achievement
[21:25.710 --> 21:26.830]  because he's already got the achievement.
[21:28.350 --> 21:28.870]  That...
[21:28.870 --> 21:30.570]  That checks out.
[21:31.150 --> 21:32.490]  Let me...
[21:33.270 --> 21:33.750]  Paladin...
[21:36.290 --> 21:37.250]  Paladin Prime.
[21:40.630 --> 21:42.290]  I think that was the name of that guy.
[21:43.150 --> 21:43.570]  No?
[21:44.890 --> 21:45.930]  Is that not his name?
[21:47.270 --> 21:50.150]  What if you personally refund everyone's game?
[21:50.310 --> 21:51.490]  Just send all of these people
[21:51.490 --> 21:52.370]  a dollar fifty.
[21:53.190 --> 21:53.670]  No.
[21:54.550 --> 21:56.590]  It's a great game. They don't need to be refunded.
[21:57.330 --> 21:58.290]  Paladin Prime.
[21:58.490 --> 22:01.250]  The eyes are both...
[22:01.250 --> 22:02.910]  That's my recently played with.
[22:03.970 --> 22:05.210]  Here we go.
[22:06.470 --> 22:08.010]  P-A-L-A-D
[22:09.030 --> 22:09.630]  D-1
[22:09.630 --> 22:11.330]  N
[22:12.450 --> 22:13.890]  P-R
[22:13.890 --> 22:15.570]  1
[22:16.570 --> 22:17.750]  M-E
[22:17.750 --> 22:19.970]  Paladin Prime
[22:21.930 --> 22:22.810]  People
[22:23.910 --> 22:24.690]  Let's see.
[22:26.170 --> 22:27.650]  Oh, that's a big gamer score.
[22:28.290 --> 22:29.530]  That checks out.
[22:30.150 --> 22:30.510]  Wow.
[22:32.670 --> 22:33.390]  They...
[22:34.890 --> 22:36.150]  Fixed it.
[22:38.930 --> 22:40.210]  So there he goes.
[22:40.430 --> 22:41.930]  He can now...
[22:41.930 --> 22:43.890]  He can now return.
[22:44.730 --> 22:46.370]  What's he gonna think you're talking about?
[22:46.770 --> 22:47.430]  I don't...
[22:47.430 --> 22:51.730]  I meant...
[22:54.610 --> 22:56.550]  I meant Mr. Trials.
[23:01.670 --> 23:02.030]  Uh...
[23:02.030 --> 23:02.910]  B-T-Tub.
[23:03.350 --> 23:05.490]  We don't have time. We don't have time to write all that.
[23:07.350 --> 23:09.090]  He's online. He might see it.
[23:09.130 --> 23:10.610]  Do we give him a minute to see if he replies?
[23:11.950 --> 23:12.610]  Give him a minute.
[23:13.890 --> 23:15.650]  Let's look at these other reviews.
[23:16.670 --> 23:19.250]  That guy figured it out. He's the only one that figured it out.
[23:19.670 --> 23:20.470]  I like it.
[23:22.510 --> 23:22.870]  But...
[23:24.070 --> 23:25.750]  I didn't have to start back at level one.
[23:25.750 --> 23:26.990]  Level one is for 90% of the time.
[23:29.250 --> 23:29.970]  This guy...
[23:30.370 --> 23:31.530]  This guy spent some time in it.
[23:31.550 --> 23:32.790]  He's figured out all the quirks.
[23:33.350 --> 23:34.750]  Yeah, he's really narrowed it down.
[23:35.210 --> 23:38.330]  What I think is so funny about Paladin Prime's review is it's two stars.
[23:39.030 --> 23:41.070]  He really evaluated what to give it.
[23:41.190 --> 23:41.370]  Yeah.
[23:41.450 --> 23:42.990]  He thinks it's beyond a one.
[23:43.410 --> 23:44.530]  What review are you gonna give it?
[23:44.950 --> 23:47.090]  I mean, I would, uh...
[23:47.090 --> 23:49.050]  Oh, let's add a rating. I've never done this before.
[23:49.150 --> 23:49.770]  This is cool.
[23:50.710 --> 23:53.210]  This is, uh...
[23:53.560 --> 23:55.290]  We're gonna do four bikes.
[23:55.790 --> 23:57.130]  Add a review.
[23:57.890 --> 24:00.090]  Yeah. Four out of five bikes.
[24:00.990 --> 24:01.930]  What's your headline?
[24:04.050 --> 24:04.890]  Good.
[24:08.170 --> 24:09.690]  Uh, review.
[24:12.570 --> 24:13.970]  Would've given five.
[24:17.550 --> 24:19.450]  Would've given five.
[24:24.850 --> 24:25.430]  But...
[24:25.970 --> 24:28.350]  Not enough...
[24:30.310 --> 24:32.130]  Not enough Chinese bikes.
[24:35.550 --> 24:36.710]  Really, it's...
[24:36.710 --> 24:39.190]  It was a big misstep by them only having one.
[24:39.450 --> 24:42.190]  I thought you were gonna say not enough, uh...
[24:42.190 --> 24:43.630]  Opportunities to see the main menu.
[24:46.530 --> 24:47.690]  As well...
[24:50.990 --> 24:52.150]  As lack...
[24:52.150 --> 24:53.190]  As well as...
[24:53.190 --> 24:56.150]  As a lack of opportunities to see the menu.
[24:58.490 --> 24:59.770]  I think we...
[24:59.770 --> 25:02.030]  I think we summarized that experience well.
[25:04.770 --> 25:05.250]  Autofill...
[25:05.250 --> 25:07.950]  To see...
[25:08.770 --> 25:11.270]  Do you think that this just gets published immediately?
[25:11.870 --> 25:13.150]  I like that you wrote S-E
[25:13.150 --> 25:16.390]  and then moved away from the E to go up and hit C.
[25:16.790 --> 25:19.090]  Which was way more clicks than just hitting E again.
[25:19.490 --> 25:20.050]  Yeah, you're right.
[25:20.730 --> 25:22.190]  Hey, that was dumb.
[25:22.970 --> 25:24.210]  You're right about that.
[25:24.650 --> 25:25.330]  Submit now.
[25:26.610 --> 25:28.030]  Oh! It's just in!
[25:28.630 --> 25:29.470]  I'm just in!
[25:30.950 --> 25:33.210]  Everybody thumbs up my review, please.
[25:33.810 --> 25:34.610]  Did you get...
[25:34.610 --> 25:36.330]  Did you get a reply from Paladin Prime?
[25:36.930 --> 25:37.790]  I don't think so.
[25:38.850 --> 25:40.430]  This is an Xbox message, sadly.
[25:41.350 --> 25:41.690]  Aww.
[25:42.130 --> 25:44.070]  What a crushing game.
[25:44.670 --> 25:45.150]  What a game.
[25:45.750 --> 25:47.270]  What a video.
[25:47.840 --> 25:49.650]  Oh wow, there's an ice environment.
[25:50.870 --> 25:52.830]  Think about how many times you'd have to see the main menu
[25:52.830 --> 25:54.110]  to get to that last stage.
[25:54.450 --> 25:54.610]  Oh!
[25:55.710 --> 25:57.990]  Maybe we can see it here in this one minute trial.
[25:59.170 --> 26:00.050]  That's the same...
[26:00.050 --> 26:01.430]  That's the same four notes.
[26:03.690 --> 26:04.530]  This is...
[26:08.830 --> 26:09.250]  Brilliant!
[26:13.890 --> 26:14.730]  Oh, man.
[26:17.270 --> 26:18.450]  Oh my god!
[26:20.690 --> 26:22.770]  This feels like a Roblox game.
[26:22.810 --> 26:24.170]  This feels like a game you'd find
[26:24.170 --> 26:25.710]  within Roblox.
[26:25.770 --> 26:26.590]  Nice moves!
[26:27.770 --> 26:28.290]  Cool!
[26:29.970 --> 26:30.570]  Oh!
[26:30.950 --> 26:32.710]  Oh man, showing off those physics.
[26:33.270 --> 26:35.390]  It might be the most accurate trailer ever.
[26:35.930 --> 26:37.770]  In that you get all of the game music
[26:37.770 --> 26:38.550]  in the trailer.
[26:40.930 --> 26:41.530]  Oh!
[26:41.710 --> 26:42.230]  Space?
[26:43.190 --> 26:43.990]  Oh my god.
[26:44.750 --> 26:45.970]  I never would have guessed.
[26:46.590 --> 26:48.050]  This is like Fast and Furious.
[26:49.130 --> 26:50.570]  Oh shit!
[26:50.690 --> 26:51.470]  He's Evil Knievel!
[26:52.450 --> 26:52.830]  Flying!
[26:53.330 --> 26:53.930]  Yeah!
[26:57.730 --> 26:59.510]  Mr. Trials!
[27:01.330 --> 27:02.090]  Well...
[27:02.090 --> 27:03.370]  Imagine that being at E3.
[27:04.490 --> 27:05.170]  Ha!
[27:06.050 --> 27:08.030]  That's what closes up the show.
[27:08.350 --> 27:10.110]  That's Phil Spencers in One More.
[27:10.590 --> 27:11.630]  Oh man.
[27:11.630 --> 27:12.870]  One more thing.
[27:19.210 --> 27:20.230]  Entity 3 Limited.
[27:20.370 --> 27:22.590]  We'll have to keep our eyes out on that studio.
[27:22.750 --> 27:23.770]  See what else they're up to.
[27:24.130 --> 27:24.830]  Wait, what is this?
[27:25.210 --> 27:26.970]  Completing 50 amazing levels?
[27:28.570 --> 27:29.810]  Didn't it say 200 levels?
[27:31.710 --> 27:32.310]  Uh, where?
[27:33.150 --> 27:33.990]  In the achievements?
[27:35.050 --> 27:36.150]  Or was it 200 gamerscore?
[27:36.350 --> 27:37.310]  I think it was 200 points.
[27:38.450 --> 27:39.170]  Yeah, a lot of 50.
[27:39.170 --> 27:40.530]  Thank god.
[27:41.150 --> 27:42.610]  Yeah, they didn't misrepresent it.
[27:44.030 --> 27:45.390]  Wait, Mr. Trials' website?
[27:45.890 --> 27:47.630]  Wait, wait one second.
[27:48.670 --> 27:51.190]  We gotta go to Mr. Trials' website before we leave.
[27:51.850 --> 27:53.090]  What if it's just a button that says,
[27:53.310 --> 27:54.750]  Buy Mr. Trials IP?
[27:54.750 --> 27:55.190]  It'd be better.
[27:57.750 --> 27:59.390]  Awesome titles, great games.
[27:59.910 --> 28:01.550]  It's just a generic...
[28:02.630 --> 28:04.290]  It's just a generic page.
[28:06.410 --> 28:07.650]  Providing exceptional titles,
[28:08.450 --> 28:10.170]  Okay, what is this?
[28:11.410 --> 28:13.210]  Oh! Paperbad looks great!
[28:14.290 --> 28:15.090]  Gang Blast?
[28:16.910 --> 28:17.310]  Skyroll?
[28:17.690 --> 28:18.050]  What?
[28:19.770 --> 28:21.210]  Wow, Mr. Trials is not even on there.
[28:21.310 --> 28:21.530]  Email!
[28:23.430 --> 28:25.270]  What was the Mr. Trials support
[28:25.270 --> 28:26.270]  on the other page?
[28:27.630 --> 28:28.810]  Uh, let's go there.
[28:29.890 --> 28:30.710]  Well, first, actually,
[28:30.750 --> 28:32.050]  I just want to click games really quick.
[28:32.130 --> 28:33.890]  I want to make sure that Mr. Trials...
[28:33.890 --> 28:34.790]  Maybe it's too new.
[28:34.790 --> 28:37.010]  It's too new. It's their newest entry.
[28:37.930 --> 28:39.510]  Uh, okay. Back up.
[28:39.950 --> 28:40.910]  Mr. Trials support.
[28:41.830 --> 28:42.510]  Same page.
[28:43.230 --> 28:43.630]  Oh, no.
[28:45.310 --> 28:45.590]  Wait.
[28:48.730 --> 28:50.210]  Joe Rogan pushes back against
[28:50.210 --> 28:50.530]  Jared's head.
[28:50.710 --> 28:52.790]  It's just the, uh...
[28:52.790 --> 28:54.350]  I think it's just this page.
[28:54.530 --> 28:55.550]  I don't...
[28:59.430 --> 29:00.650]  I don't know.
[29:00.730 --> 29:01.890]  Why did it take us here?
[29:03.450 --> 29:04.670]  What's generally awesome?
[29:05.310 --> 29:06.390]  I don't know.
[29:07.630 --> 29:09.530]  Did you just go back? Are these all your tabs?
[29:09.910 --> 29:11.370]  Why do you have so many tabs on your Xbox?
[29:11.770 --> 29:12.930]  I don't know.
[29:13.390 --> 29:14.290]  I don't use this.
[29:14.730 --> 29:15.470]  What were all those?
[29:15.970 --> 29:16.890]  I don't know.
[29:17.390 --> 29:18.090]  Report this product.
[29:21.150 --> 29:22.270]  It just...
[29:22.270 --> 29:24.710]  The support is, here's the domain.
[29:25.210 --> 29:26.710]  Search for it yourself, fucker.
[29:27.370 --> 29:28.470]  Go find your own help.
[29:28.790 --> 29:29.990]  20 cool things about bananas.
[29:30.610 --> 29:31.230]  What was that headline?
[29:32.950 --> 29:34.530]  20 things to do with bananas.
[29:35.010 --> 29:35.670]  Let's see.
[29:36.290 --> 29:37.930]  20 clever uses for bananas,
[29:38.030 --> 29:38.870]  besides eating them.
[29:39.370 --> 29:40.130]  Tripping people?
[29:40.630 --> 29:43.390]  Gavin, this is just a new series we're doing now.
[29:43.470 --> 29:44.430]  Plug Mr. Trials.
[29:44.830 --> 29:46.950]  This is just us looking at the Xbox.
[29:47.050 --> 29:48.590]  How far can we get away from the game?
[29:49.050 --> 29:50.550]  What to do with those extra bananas.
[29:52.290 --> 29:53.590]  Let's go through this.
[29:53.870 --> 29:54.390]  Recipes?
[29:55.130 --> 29:56.450]  Make a face mask.
[29:59.110 --> 29:59.630]  Uh...
[30:00.290 --> 30:00.570]  Okay.
[30:02.070 --> 30:02.970]  Eat a fruit.
[30:03.450 --> 30:04.750]  You've literally...
[30:04.750 --> 30:07.570]  It took you two to immediately eat it.
[30:08.290 --> 30:10.710]  The descriptor was things to do outside of that.
[30:12.070 --> 30:14.330]  Polish silverware and leather shoes.
[30:14.990 --> 30:15.290]  What?
[30:16.290 --> 30:17.490]  Tenderize a roast.
[30:18.710 --> 30:18.990]  What?
[30:19.690 --> 30:20.450]  Brighten up house.
[30:20.550 --> 30:22.710]  I thought that was going to be make somebody fall over.
[30:23.030 --> 30:24.270]  When I saw that photo.
[30:25.230 --> 30:26.410]  Let's put a peel on the ground.
[30:27.190 --> 30:28.110]  Deter Athens.
[30:29.550 --> 30:31.350]  Use as fertilizer and mulch.
[30:31.490 --> 30:32.530]  You could...
[30:33.090 --> 30:34.150]  You could use that.
[30:35.130 --> 30:36.090]  Ripen an avocado?
[30:38.630 --> 30:39.070]  What?
[30:39.870 --> 30:41.810]  Why did you sound like you were from Boston then?
[30:42.710 --> 30:43.310]  Did I?
[30:44.750 --> 30:45.630]  What part?
[30:45.770 --> 30:47.690]  What did I say that sounded like it was from Boston?
[30:48.130 --> 30:48.570]  Avocado?
[30:49.390 --> 30:49.830]  Avocado?
[30:50.610 --> 30:51.050]  Avocado?
[30:53.850 --> 30:55.270]  Is that how I'm supposed to...
[30:55.270 --> 30:56.270]  How am I supposed to say it?
[30:56.810 --> 30:57.750]  I don't know. Avocado?
[30:58.130 --> 30:58.750]  What's that?
[30:59.710 --> 31:00.190]  Pustule?
[31:02.910 --> 31:03.870]  Remove warts?
[31:04.070 --> 31:05.570]  Use a banana to take out a wart?
[31:06.910 --> 31:07.390]  What?
[31:08.690 --> 31:10.170]  A butterfly had to compost.
[31:10.630 --> 31:11.950]  They already had a compost thing.
[31:13.710 --> 31:14.930]  Well, that's bananas.
[31:15.190 --> 31:15.870]  What was...
[31:15.870 --> 31:19.190]  Do you remember the name of any of those other games that they had listed?
[31:20.230 --> 31:20.950]  Gang Blast?
[31:21.530 --> 31:22.150]  Oh, here we go.
[31:22.250 --> 31:24.190]  We're already here. We don't even need to explore.
[31:24.790 --> 31:25.650]  Let's see.
[31:26.070 --> 31:27.510]  Paper Bad and Gang Blast.
[31:27.570 --> 31:29.190]  Let's see if those are on the Xbox Store.
[31:29.430 --> 31:32.270]  And then we'll wrap up this video that has gone off the rails.
[31:32.850 --> 31:34.070]  Paper Blast.
[31:38.390 --> 31:38.930]  Nope.
[31:39.990 --> 31:42.090]  And then it was Gang something?
[31:42.910 --> 31:43.690]  Gang Blast.
[31:44.410 --> 31:47.030]  No, it was Paper Bad and Gang Blast.
[31:47.730 --> 31:48.770]  Oh, okay.
[31:49.190 --> 31:51.090]  Well, there's no Gang Blast.
[31:51.210 --> 31:52.730]  So now we'll try Paper Bad.
[31:54.650 --> 31:55.090]  Paper...
[31:57.450 --> 31:57.890]  Nope.
[32:00.270 --> 32:00.710]  Nope.
[32:01.410 --> 32:03.090]  So they haven't, you know, their footprint...
[32:03.090 --> 32:05.130]  They're not largely on Xbox yet. They'll get there.
[32:06.090 --> 32:06.970]  I'm sure...
[32:07.450 --> 32:08.990]  Skyro... Oh, we gotta check out Skyro...
[32:08.990 --> 32:09.870]  Axe Champ as well.
[32:10.110 --> 32:13.510]  Might as well just round the roster out.
[32:14.550 --> 32:15.150]  Uh, nope.
[32:15.310 --> 32:17.510]  Okay. Skyro...
[32:17.510 --> 32:19.990]  Did you know that they made a new Marble Blast Ultra?
[32:20.990 --> 32:22.010]  No. What?
[32:22.590 --> 32:23.750]  There's a new Marble Blast.
[32:24.350 --> 32:24.690]  Where?
[32:24.930 --> 32:27.390]  Skyro, let me...
[32:27.390 --> 32:28.950]  Is it Mr. Marble?
[32:29.850 --> 32:32.050]  No, it's the real...
[32:32.050 --> 32:33.750]  Marble it up Ultra.
[32:36.050 --> 32:37.410]  Is it the same people?
[32:37.850 --> 32:39.130]  Like the Marble Blast people?
[32:39.470 --> 32:40.590]  I don't think so.
[32:42.430 --> 32:43.030]  $40?!
[32:44.050 --> 32:45.550]  Are you shitting me?
[32:45.730 --> 32:47.870]  That's Canadian, so it's probably like $25.
[32:47.870 --> 32:49.190]  I wanna see the trailer.
[32:49.650 --> 32:50.990]  Okay, let's watch the trailer.
[32:52.190 --> 32:53.350]  Oh, let's see the reviews first.
[32:53.690 --> 32:55.690]  Oh, Gavin, five stars.
[32:56.370 --> 32:58.270]  Worst game...
[32:58.270 --> 33:00.070]  Wait, terrible...
[33:00.070 --> 33:00.790]  Terrible game, dude.
[33:01.330 --> 33:03.790]  It wastes $30 plus dollars.
[33:04.090 --> 33:04.310]  Deleted.
[33:04.870 --> 33:08.850]  Game causes vertigo and health problems.
[33:10.090 --> 33:10.610]  That is somebody...
[33:10.610 --> 33:11.130]  Go and play it!
[33:11.670 --> 33:14.850]  That is somebody who has anger issues, very clearly.
[33:15.350 --> 33:16.310]  Everyone else is like,
[33:16.310 --> 33:17.150]  He's great.
[33:18.970 --> 33:21.730]  Okay, let's watch the trailer for Marble it up Ultra.
[33:24.510 --> 33:27.870]  Marble Blast Ultra was so much fun.
[33:28.870 --> 33:29.490]  Oh, it is!
[33:29.570 --> 33:30.750]  It's from the creators of Marble Blast.
[33:33.870 --> 33:34.890]  Why does it have so few reviews?
[33:35.010 --> 33:36.330]  And why are people not...
[33:36.930 --> 33:39.290]  talking about how exciting this is?
[33:39.590 --> 33:41.030]  Oh, there's a Burger Marble.
[33:45.270 --> 33:45.710]  Gyrocopter!
[33:46.890 --> 33:48.830]  I'm really into this.
[33:51.350 --> 33:51.870]  Shortcut!
[33:52.190 --> 33:53.830]  Okay, is there multiplayer though?
[33:54.570 --> 33:56.470]  I know the campaign is cool, but...
[33:58.110 --> 33:59.590]  100 dazzling levels to master.
[33:59.890 --> 34:02.150]  I'm worried that it's not going to say anything about multiplayer.
[34:04.090 --> 34:04.390]  Oh!
[34:05.110 --> 34:07.050]  Oh, shit! Get those gems!
[34:07.370 --> 34:07.970]  Hunt for gems.
[34:10.330 --> 34:10.850]  Scorgle?
[34:11.190 --> 34:12.370]  Oh, it's Rocket League?
[34:12.810 --> 34:15.190]  If this game feels right, I'm definitely getting it.
[34:15.870 --> 34:18.010]  Evade zombies in a game of tag?
[34:18.170 --> 34:19.650]  And knock out foes in... oh.
[34:20.770 --> 34:21.330]  Although...
[34:21.950 --> 34:23.390]  $35, Jesus.
[34:23.950 --> 34:25.130]  That'll be what I pay.
[34:26.030 --> 34:27.810]  I guess that'll be what the company pays.
[34:28.350 --> 34:28.910]  We make money.
[34:29.170 --> 34:30.270]  Is that a Minion Ball?
[34:32.430 --> 34:33.990]  That was a Moon Ball.
[34:35.010 --> 34:36.830]  111 it up Ultra.
[34:41.290 --> 34:41.850]  Anyway...
[34:41.850 --> 34:44.550]  Thank you so much for whatever this video was.
[34:44.550 --> 34:45.630]  It was a lot of fun.
[34:46.230 --> 34:47.670]  It was Mr. Trials, wasn't it?
[34:47.890 --> 34:49.030]  Yeah, it was Mr. Trials.
[34:50.250 --> 34:52.670]  Oh, we're back.
[34:53.090 --> 34:53.530]  On their website.
[34:55.410 --> 34:56.630]  Thank you for joining, Gavin.
[34:57.210 --> 34:58.930]  Thank you for the people watching.
[34:59.550 --> 35:00.250]  Thanks for that journey.
[35:01.010 --> 35:02.270]  Check out Regulation Podcast.
[35:02.790 --> 35:03.490]  We have a Patreon.
[35:04.010 --> 35:06.730]  I don't imagine you'll check out either of those things based on this video.
[35:07.110 --> 35:08.070]  But I had a great time.
[35:08.710 --> 35:09.750]  You have a good time, Gavin?
[35:10.410 --> 35:12.490]  Oh, hell yeah. I liked all your achievements.
[35:12.890 --> 35:13.870]  Oh, that was great.
[35:14.510 --> 35:16.490]  We gotta file a bug report for them.
[35:16.550 --> 35:17.490]  We gotta help them out.
[35:19.010 --> 35:20.110]  How about just a report?
[35:21.130 --> 35:22.130]  Just report them.
[35:22.670 --> 35:23.690]  Thank you so much for watching.
[35:23.790 --> 35:23.970]  Bye!
