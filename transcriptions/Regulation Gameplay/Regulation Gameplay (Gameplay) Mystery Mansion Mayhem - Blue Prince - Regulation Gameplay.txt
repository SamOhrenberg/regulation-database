[00:00.420 --> 00:02.620]  Alright, who wants to lead this one?
[00:06.170 --> 00:07.010]  Uh, Nick, go ahead.
[00:07.230 --> 00:08.530]  What? I don't even know what it is!
[00:08.590 --> 00:10.850]  Welcome to Blueprints, guys!
[00:10.950 --> 00:14.750]  It's Blueprints, the number one game, the hottest game of the year right now.
[00:14.830 --> 00:16.330]  Everyone's excited about Blueprints.
[00:16.670 --> 00:19.890]  And the thing is, Gavin, Geoff, and Andrew have all played it.
[00:20.130 --> 00:20.990]  Me and Nick haven't.
[00:21.110 --> 00:25.110]  And Nick's gonna take a crack at the first run, blind style.
[00:25.290 --> 00:25.850]  Wait, yeah.
[00:25.850 --> 00:27.970]  At Blueprints. Nick, how are you feeling about Blueprints?
[00:28.270 --> 00:29.290]  How did you get out of this?
[00:30.230 --> 00:33.630]  I think somebody said Nick should do this, and I didn't say a word.
[00:33.690 --> 00:35.390]  That was me. I threw it at Nick.
[00:35.470 --> 00:37.910]  And I sat quietly. I didn't say,
[00:38.250 --> 00:41.210]  this is gonna be like this other hard thing we have to do another time,
[00:41.250 --> 00:43.230]  and now we're doing it tomorrow. You dunce.
[00:43.830 --> 00:44.470]  You're welcome.
[00:45.630 --> 00:46.430]  It'll be great.
[00:46.570 --> 00:48.490]  Geoff put it in the Slack saying,
[00:48.590 --> 00:49.670]  has anyone played this game?
[00:49.930 --> 00:53.630]  And I think I was like 55 hours into that.
[00:53.910 --> 00:54.310]  Wow!
[00:54.510 --> 00:55.810]  So we're both very deep.
[00:56.650 --> 00:56.970]  Wow!
[00:57.870 --> 00:59.010]  Oh, my God.
[00:59.810 --> 01:00.970]  That is just so addictive.
[01:01.390 --> 01:03.810]  You discover something, and you're like, ah, just one more day.
[01:04.010 --> 01:04.370]  One more day.
[01:04.590 --> 01:05.570]  Just one more day.
[01:06.050 --> 01:07.850]  I can do a short day. I'll just end it early.
[01:08.350 --> 01:09.370]  Oh, well, maybe one more.
[01:09.510 --> 01:11.610]  Do we need to skip this or go?
[01:13.970 --> 01:14.370]  What do you mean?
[01:14.630 --> 01:16.950]  Do you want to skip this intro bit, or do I need to watch this?
[01:17.170 --> 01:18.670]  No, you want to know what the fuck you're doing.
[01:18.850 --> 01:19.510]  It's very tonal.
[01:19.590 --> 01:19.870]  Pay attention.
[01:20.810 --> 01:21.950]  It's not super long.
[01:22.090 --> 01:22.610]  Wait, are there subtitles?
[01:25.470 --> 01:27.210]  I don't even know if there's really...
[01:27.770 --> 01:36.020]  Oh, is he dead?
[01:36.380 --> 01:36.760]  Yep.
[01:37.180 --> 01:37.540]  He is.
[01:37.760 --> 01:38.160]  Watch.
[01:41.460 --> 01:42.960]  These are all clues, dude.
[01:43.060 --> 01:43.540]  Pay attention.
[01:43.860 --> 01:44.880]  You recorded it on a...
[01:44.880 --> 01:46.600]  You can solve the game right now, just on this cutscene.
[01:47.280 --> 01:47.300]  Yep.
[01:47.640 --> 01:48.020]  Got it.
[01:48.180 --> 01:48.580]  Turntable.
[01:50.020 --> 01:51.360]  I thought it said rectal for a second.
[01:52.460 --> 01:53.900]  Miss Mariah Bowles' rectal.
[02:09.040 --> 02:10.540]  God damn, that's huge.
[02:11.080 --> 02:12.700]  It's going to be yours if you figure this out.
[02:12.760 --> 02:13.140]  Sweet.
[02:13.320 --> 02:13.720]  Sometimes.
[02:18.270 --> 02:19.390]  This game is so good.
[02:25.810 --> 02:27.050]  Oh, that's just bad planning.
[02:27.790 --> 02:27.910]  What?
[02:28.110 --> 02:28.210]  What?
[02:33.720 --> 02:35.480]  It's going to be dusty as fuck in there.
[02:36.140 --> 02:36.340]  Why?
[02:36.440 --> 02:37.340]  It's right next to the Great Hall.
[02:37.440 --> 02:38.200]  It's right there.
[02:39.020 --> 02:39.420]  Oh, wow.
[02:39.460 --> 02:40.480]  We hid this room.
[02:40.600 --> 02:41.640]  It's right next to the entrance.
[02:42.120 --> 02:42.540]  Get real.
[02:43.340 --> 02:43.980]  Game over.
[02:53.910 --> 02:55.390]  They're going to cut your dick off.
[02:56.530 --> 02:56.710]  Finally.
[02:56.710 --> 02:58.570]  He just went to a room and was like, yeah, this is 46.
[03:00.930 --> 03:02.150]  He just walked right in.
[03:02.210 --> 03:02.730]  How did you...
[03:10.250 --> 03:11.110]  Oh, 1993.
[03:11.770 --> 03:12.110]  Good year.
[03:12.830 --> 03:13.170]  Good year?
[03:13.250 --> 03:13.670]  Pretty good year.
[03:13.870 --> 03:14.310]  Pretty good year.
[03:14.690 --> 03:16.470]  Wouldn't that be right before Jurassic Park came out?
[03:16.710 --> 03:16.830]  Yeah.
[03:17.550 --> 03:19.370]  There's a lot of anticipation in the air, you know?
[03:19.770 --> 03:20.670]  My senior year of high school.
[03:21.450 --> 03:21.890]  Wow.
[03:22.510 --> 03:23.110]  Pretty good year.
[03:23.290 --> 03:23.770]  Pretty good year.
[03:25.770 --> 03:26.570]  Some of the blueprints.
[03:27.270 --> 03:34.950]  If someone finds my notes on this game who doesn't game, I'd be straight in an insane asylum.
[03:35.310 --> 03:35.530]  Yeah.
[03:35.910 --> 03:38.590]  Just the scrawlings of an absolute lunatic.
[03:38.590 --> 03:41.090]  Do I need to be writing stuff?
[03:42.990 --> 03:45.090]  I screenshotted my strategy.
[03:45.410 --> 03:46.990]  I take photos with my phone.
[03:47.030 --> 03:51.270]  Yeah, I've got a lot of pictures, but also there's some stuff that you need to write.
[03:51.950 --> 03:52.610]  You're in.
[03:54.110 --> 03:54.510]  So...
[03:55.790 --> 03:56.970]  He stomped his toe.
[03:57.230 --> 03:59.110]  He walked two feet into the room and stomped his toe.
[03:59.510 --> 03:59.790]  Oh, no.
[04:00.330 --> 04:01.710]  A trip to the world come back.
[04:01.730 --> 04:02.230]  All right, there we go.
[04:02.570 --> 04:03.110]  Oh, what's this?
[04:04.490 --> 04:06.590]  Open only in the event of my death.
[04:06.670 --> 04:07.730]  Good news or bad.
[04:09.830 --> 04:12.010]  You may not remember, but I have a fond memory.
[04:12.790 --> 04:14.490]  This game has everything I don't like.
[04:15.630 --> 04:17.550]  You don't like to miss it, do you?
[04:17.550 --> 04:19.830]  By the time you read this, I will assume you are fully aware of my last wishes.
[04:20.270 --> 04:23.150]  Please do not mistake my intentions in giving you this challenge as a lack of confidence.
[04:23.290 --> 04:25.710]  I assure you nothing could have been further from my mind when I chose you as my heir.
[04:25.830 --> 04:26.610]  With that said, there are a few...
[04:28.430 --> 04:30.870]  No old tools or items may be brought onto the estate from the outside.
[04:31.030 --> 04:33.110]  Tools and items found on the estate may not be taken off the estate.
[04:33.370 --> 04:34.490]  You may not stay overnight.
[04:34.690 --> 04:35.310]  Wow, what a dick.
[04:35.750 --> 04:36.530]  Do you have to leave?
[04:37.170 --> 04:37.590]  I guess so.
[04:37.590 --> 04:39.290]  I don't suspect that any of these stipulations should...
[04:40.690 --> 04:44.050]  ...start fresh each morning, not rely on the successes of the previous day.
[04:44.250 --> 04:45.590]  Oh, balls.
[04:45.990 --> 04:46.990]  One final word of advice.
[04:47.090 --> 04:49.290]  Do not assume the rooms you find today will be the same rooms you find tomorrow.
[04:49.390 --> 04:51.350]  These grounds have provided me a home for the last half century,
[04:51.470 --> 04:54.430]  and even I am certain which room lies beyond any particular door.
[04:55.170 --> 04:55.830]  Grandmother used to say,
[04:56.070 --> 04:56.950]  Don't go where the path leads.
[04:57.010 --> 04:58.470]  The man in the path, go where you want to lead.
[04:58.710 --> 04:59.590]  With all my love and best wishes,
[04:59.930 --> 05:01.190]  Dead Man, Uncle Herbert.
[05:02.910 --> 05:05.090]  Well, I think that was a...
[05:05.090 --> 05:05.730]  Was that like a map?
[05:06.430 --> 05:06.570]  Where?
[05:06.570 --> 05:06.810]  Probably.
[05:07.790 --> 05:07.830]  Where?
[05:08.190 --> 05:08.930]  What do you mean where?
[05:09.050 --> 05:09.590]  Oh my God.
[05:09.650 --> 05:11.750]  Oh my God, this is going to be a great playthrough.
[05:11.750 --> 05:12.430]  Guys, this might be wrong.
[05:12.430 --> 05:12.790]  Where?
[05:12.930 --> 05:13.150]  What?
[05:13.350 --> 05:13.990]  What are you talking about?
[05:14.050 --> 05:14.570]  Oh, this.
[05:14.770 --> 05:15.270]  The blueprint.
[05:15.670 --> 05:16.530]  Oh, the blue...
[05:16.530 --> 05:17.150]  Oh!
[05:18.030 --> 05:18.230]  Oh!
[05:19.590 --> 05:19.950]  Oh!
[05:20.570 --> 05:21.510]  There you go.
[05:21.750 --> 05:22.770]  An antechamber.
[05:22.790 --> 05:26.110]  All right, if you want to just go to that bottom right-hand corner and call it a day.
[05:26.750 --> 05:27.210]  Oh, no.
[05:27.210 --> 05:28.590]  All right, let's go back out the door.
[05:29.750 --> 05:30.970]  Is there a sprint function?
[05:31.530 --> 05:32.110]  Oh my God.
[05:32.130 --> 05:33.190]  Left trigger, I believe.
[05:33.510 --> 05:34.870]  It's like a stroll function.
[05:36.310 --> 05:39.250]  Each time you enter a room, you will lose one feat.
[05:39.350 --> 05:39.550]  What?
[05:40.530 --> 05:43.050]  When you no longer have any feats left, you'll be too tired to...
[05:44.090 --> 05:45.250]  So I have 50 feats.
[05:46.130 --> 05:47.350]  50 rooms, essentially.
[05:48.130 --> 05:49.070]  This should just be it.
[05:49.070 --> 05:49.210]  Oh, what?
[05:49.250 --> 05:52.070]  On the blueprint, it was just to the left, so we should be good.
[05:52.350 --> 05:53.670]  Select a room to draft.
[05:54.370 --> 05:57.810]  It's important that you know that you can open the map on this screen.
[05:58.450 --> 05:59.650]  Yeah, if you hit right trigger.
[05:59.850 --> 06:02.770]  And it will tell you how the room will be laid out on the grid.
[06:02.950 --> 06:03.210]  Oh.
[06:03.710 --> 06:07.470]  Because if you go to closet, it looks like closet ends it.
[06:07.710 --> 06:09.950]  Okay, so it looks like I can continue that way if I do that.
[06:09.970 --> 06:10.850]  All right, I'll make a hallway.
[06:12.370 --> 06:13.310]  Love a hallway, Nick.
[06:13.450 --> 06:14.230]  Love a hallway.
[06:15.130 --> 06:16.070]  Look at this.
[06:17.410 --> 06:18.710]  Got two doors to pick from.
[06:19.050 --> 06:19.290]  Yeah.
[06:22.910 --> 06:27.090]  I don't know what I'm doing, so this will be like an exploratory route this time.
[06:27.190 --> 06:27.870]  It's got to be, dude.
[06:28.590 --> 06:29.870]  Corridor is always left unlocked.
[06:30.390 --> 06:30.610]  All right.
[06:32.310 --> 06:33.250]  He's going up.
[06:35.530 --> 06:36.890]  A slight stroll.
[06:39.330 --> 06:40.830]  Oh, a nook.
[06:41.830 --> 06:43.550]  I like what you got to pick from here.
[06:43.910 --> 06:44.610]  What is the...
[06:45.230 --> 06:47.090]  Okay, so parlor has like a puzzle piece.
[06:47.610 --> 06:48.810]  This one has a blue key.
[06:48.930 --> 06:50.290]  Like, these are things that you collect.
[06:50.530 --> 06:51.390]  Is that what this is?
[06:51.750 --> 06:55.650]  And then the puzzle piece, I assume, is a puzzle you have to solve in order to pass through.
[06:56.110 --> 06:58.410]  Didn't even notice there were markings on these.
[06:58.510 --> 06:58.750]  Excellent.
[06:58.890 --> 06:59.310]  Let's take a look.
[06:59.310 --> 07:00.590]  Holy shit.
[07:00.850 --> 07:01.010]  Oh boy.
[07:01.010 --> 07:02.110]  He's doing the puzzle.
[07:02.730 --> 07:02.850]  Okay.
[07:03.090 --> 07:04.370]  There are three boxes in this room.
[07:04.770 --> 07:06.550]  Two boxes in this room are empty.
[07:06.830 --> 07:09.170]  This box is one of the two empty boxes.
[07:09.870 --> 07:10.310]  Okay.
[07:10.730 --> 07:13.170]  Is there anything else that will tell me anything about these boxes?
[07:13.530 --> 07:14.450]  Sure is.
[07:15.930 --> 07:16.730]  Oh, God.
[07:19.890 --> 07:22.270]  I'm reading the word that my wife sweated, lost its charm.
[07:22.370 --> 07:24.110]  I have no delusions that my company is rival to hers.
[07:24.210 --> 07:28.770]  If I can refresh your memory, we spent much of that evening discussing our mutual love
[07:28.770 --> 07:29.470]  of games and puzzles.
[07:29.650 --> 07:30.230]  Eric would hate it.
[07:30.330 --> 07:34.050]  And I had mentioned to you a rather singular parlor game I had played some years back involving
[07:34.050 --> 07:35.330]  three boxes of different colors.
[07:35.670 --> 07:38.670]  You had pressed me to write with the particulars of this game when I found the time, and I
[07:38.670 --> 07:42.270]  have included with this letter all the details you will need to share with your guests.
[07:42.430 --> 07:42.490]  Okay.
[07:43.270 --> 07:46.190]  There will always be at least one box which displays only true statements.
[07:46.590 --> 07:50.790]  There will be at least one box which displays only false statements.
[07:51.130 --> 07:52.510]  And only one box has a prize within.
[07:54.010 --> 07:56.230]  The other two are always empty.
[07:56.230 --> 08:01.590]  So you have to figure out which box has the prize, and when you hit B to back out of this,
[08:01.730 --> 08:02.530]  be sure to grab that key.
[08:02.710 --> 08:03.010]  Yeah, there you go.
[08:03.330 --> 08:04.210]  I saw that.
[08:04.630 --> 08:06.170]  A component of the parlor game.
[08:06.430 --> 08:06.590]  Alright.
[08:08.630 --> 08:09.890]  So one of them is lying.
[08:11.350 --> 08:11.930]  I feel like that one.
[08:11.930 --> 08:12.310]  Could be that one.
[08:12.390 --> 08:13.170]  The obvious lie.
[08:14.770 --> 08:16.090]  There are three boxes in this room.
[08:16.170 --> 08:16.670]  That's true.
[08:18.090 --> 08:18.790]  That is true.
[08:18.850 --> 08:20.450]  So you do know that's a true statement.
[08:20.730 --> 08:21.010]  Yes.
[08:21.470 --> 08:22.630]  Two boxes in this room are empty.
[08:22.630 --> 08:23.390]  Two boxes in this room are empty.
[08:23.570 --> 08:25.630]  But you know that's a true statement also, right?
[08:26.690 --> 08:28.190]  Based on what he wrote, yes.
[08:29.010 --> 08:29.410]  Okay.
[08:29.590 --> 08:30.110]  This box is one of them.
[08:30.130 --> 08:31.070]  So you know that...
[08:31.070 --> 08:31.610]  This is the lie.
[08:31.630 --> 08:31.850]  Okay.
[08:32.210 --> 08:33.870]  So then that has to be the lie, doesn't it?
[08:33.950 --> 08:34.210]  Yes.
[08:35.790 --> 08:36.470]  In theory.
[08:38.070 --> 08:38.470]  Yay!
[08:38.910 --> 08:39.310]  Wow.
[08:40.070 --> 08:40.390]  Congratulations.
[08:40.770 --> 08:40.890]  Look at that!
[08:41.270 --> 08:42.130]  Good job, Nick.
[08:42.170 --> 08:43.730]  Honestly, this is a baby game.
[08:44.190 --> 08:49.190]  Fun thing about these puzzles is every time you draft this room and do that puzzle, it gets harder.
[08:49.790 --> 08:51.010]  Oh, so I'm at the point now...
[08:51.010 --> 08:51.510]  That's not fun.
[08:51.510 --> 08:56.490]  ...where I have to read them all and just sit with my eyes closed for like 90 seconds to figure it out.
[08:57.330 --> 08:58.750]  Alright, let's see here.
[08:59.330 --> 08:59.730]  A den.
[09:00.190 --> 09:00.330]  Ooh, a den.
[09:00.330 --> 09:03.670]  Ooh, a den actually would not be bad because it gives me two additional ways to go.
[09:04.210 --> 09:04.990]  So let's do that.
[09:05.010 --> 09:05.730]  And you get a gem.
[09:06.330 --> 09:07.590]  Oh, and you get a gem, Nick.
[09:07.750 --> 09:09.290]  Do I just get it or do I have to do something?
[09:09.450 --> 09:09.710]  Oh, okay.
[09:09.710 --> 09:10.210]  It's on the table.
[09:11.170 --> 09:12.650]  Wow, what a generous old man.
[09:12.750 --> 09:16.490]  So I could potentially play this game without ever having to like solve a puzzle.
[09:17.030 --> 09:18.730]  Like I could just like not pick a puzzle box.
[09:18.890 --> 09:19.730]  Now that's interesting.
[09:19.730 --> 09:21.310]  So never mind.
[09:21.750 --> 09:22.570]  Oh no.
[09:23.010 --> 09:23.750]  Whatever Eric was saying.
[09:25.410 --> 09:26.910]  A drawing room.
[09:28.590 --> 09:30.610]  Yeah, that'll get me somewhere.
[09:32.070 --> 09:32.590]  Gem requirement.
[09:32.590 --> 09:34.410]  And that one costs you a gem.
[09:36.150 --> 09:38.470]  Must be a more valuable room then.
[09:39.990 --> 09:41.070]  Let's take a look-see.
[09:43.750 --> 09:44.970]  Oh, it's boarded up.
[09:45.050 --> 09:45.590]  It's a lot of art.
[09:45.670 --> 09:47.030]  Oh, that's because the other way was different.
[09:50.030 --> 09:52.390]  I get drawing room.
[09:52.770 --> 09:54.650]  I understand, but like...
[09:54.650 --> 09:57.270]  That dude likes old hunched over men.
[09:57.770 --> 09:58.270]  Are you kidding me?
[09:58.270 --> 09:59.670]  This guy's drawing horses like a motherfucker.
[10:00.390 --> 10:00.970]  Well, that's bad.
[10:02.510 --> 10:02.910]  Okay.
[10:03.390 --> 10:04.650]  Alright, so we've hit a snag.
[10:05.670 --> 10:06.230]  We have.
[10:06.770 --> 10:07.610]  So let's...
[10:07.610 --> 10:08.490]  So now you gotta go back.
[10:08.550 --> 10:09.030]  Let's go back.
[10:09.150 --> 10:09.970]  Found the need for keys.
[10:10.730 --> 10:11.510]  So we'll...
[10:11.510 --> 10:12.910]  Yeah, now we look for keys.
[10:13.130 --> 10:14.450]  See if we can get one with a key.
[10:16.530 --> 10:19.730]  You are more likely to draw green rooms while drafting.
[10:21.310 --> 10:23.050]  Yeah, you might wanna just...
[10:23.530 --> 10:24.450]  Spare room maybe?
[10:25.890 --> 10:26.910]  It's a little spare room.
[10:27.250 --> 10:29.670]  I don't think I've ever done the greenhouse still.
[10:30.190 --> 10:30.550]  Really?
[10:31.150 --> 10:31.590]  Yeah.
[10:32.010 --> 10:34.870]  Is there stuff in these rooms even if it doesn't say something?
[10:35.010 --> 10:35.730]  Like, are we supposed to...
[10:35.730 --> 10:35.830]  Yes.
[10:36.470 --> 10:36.910]  Yes.
[10:36.910 --> 10:37.190]  Oh, what?
[10:37.250 --> 10:37.470]  Really?
[10:37.910 --> 10:38.730]  There can be.
[10:38.970 --> 10:40.170]  Two items in the closet.
[10:40.250 --> 10:41.030]  Well, let's get the items.
[10:41.130 --> 10:41.650]  Maybe there's a key.
[10:43.970 --> 10:44.350]  What are you?
[10:44.350 --> 10:45.890]  It's a little dice.
[10:46.270 --> 10:46.830]  Ivory die.
[10:46.950 --> 10:48.010]  Well, drafting you may use...
[10:48.010 --> 10:48.210]  Oh!
[10:48.570 --> 10:49.450]  That's handy.
[10:49.450 --> 10:49.750]  Oh, okay.
[10:50.010 --> 10:51.330]  Yeah, if you don't like your selection.
[10:52.050 --> 10:52.450]  You can reroll.
[10:52.470 --> 10:53.110]  You said two items though.
[10:53.130 --> 10:53.810]  What was the second one?
[10:55.690 --> 10:55.850]  Yeah?
[10:55.970 --> 10:56.550]  Is there something in the middle?
[10:57.050 --> 10:57.410]  Shovel.
[10:57.870 --> 10:58.230]  Shovel.
[10:58.610 --> 10:59.130]  Can I pick it up?
[10:59.630 --> 10:59.950]  Oh, I can't.
[10:59.950 --> 11:01.370]  I didn't see the hand.
[11:02.030 --> 11:02.690]  It's tiny.
[11:02.970 --> 11:03.450]  It's tiny.
[11:03.690 --> 11:04.530]  It's a little tiny hand.
[11:04.550 --> 11:09.210]  It'd be like if Geoff or Nick in real life had his hand on the shovel and was like, what
[11:09.210 --> 11:09.670]  else would I...
[11:09.670 --> 11:11.550]  Yeah, but in real life I know it's tangible.
[11:11.550 --> 11:12.070]  What can I grab?
[11:12.390 --> 11:16.250]  It's like leaning on it with his other hand on his chin like, where's the...
[11:16.670 --> 11:19.530]  Well, I don't have a key, which means I'll probably have to go back to the entrance hall.
[11:19.610 --> 11:20.910]  You can go back to the entrance hall, yeah.
[11:21.430 --> 11:24.910]  But there's stuff in these rooms, I guess.
[11:24.910 --> 11:26.630]  How do you know if there's stuff in these rooms?
[11:26.770 --> 11:27.850]  Like, you just, like, you don't know?
[11:27.990 --> 11:29.150]  Sometimes it'll say.
[11:29.270 --> 11:31.950]  Other times you'll just have to notice it.
[11:32.170 --> 11:35.890]  And there are certain items you can also acquire that will indicate if there's...
[11:35.890 --> 11:37.330]  All right, let me see what we've built so far.
[11:37.930 --> 11:38.090]  Okay.
[11:38.170 --> 11:40.770]  You really do start getting a feel though for what you can grab more easily.
[11:40.770 --> 11:41.170]  Yeah.
[11:41.790 --> 11:42.450]  Oh, key.
[11:42.570 --> 11:45.790]  And you kind of notice where stuff will be, you know, so you just check those spots.
[11:46.250 --> 11:48.530]  Let's get a key because we can get closer if we go this way.
[11:48.990 --> 11:49.650]  Ooh, coin.
[11:51.930 --> 11:52.570]  A key.
[11:54.930 --> 11:55.690]  And a gem.
[11:55.850 --> 11:56.290]  And a gem.
[11:56.550 --> 11:56.910]  Wow.
[11:57.110 --> 11:58.110]  As promised.
[12:02.870 --> 12:03.270]  It's...
[12:04.250 --> 12:05.830]  Our first days were quite different.
[12:07.190 --> 12:07.830]  What do you mean?
[12:10.390 --> 12:15.950]  It's so wild watching someone on day one again after being where I've ended up in this game.
[12:16.190 --> 12:20.790]  In my head, like, problem-solving what's happening and then realizing, like, oh no, he doesn't...
[12:20.790 --> 12:26.690]  I feel like this is going to be a game that people are going to watch and get so frustrated watching.
[12:26.930 --> 12:28.150]  But that's fun to me.
[12:28.830 --> 12:30.710]  Oh, there's a key in the note, so...
[12:30.710 --> 12:31.350]  I'm not getting frustrated.
[12:31.350 --> 12:33.550]  So you have the ability, Nick, to redraw...
[12:33.550 --> 12:35.930]  No, no, no. I don't think it's any of us.
[12:37.430 --> 12:41.090]  So you can redraw with the pencil or the dice.
[12:41.370 --> 12:43.910]  Yeah, use the... if you want to do it, use the pencil.
[12:44.430 --> 12:45.810]  Oh, okay. I see.
[12:45.970 --> 12:47.390]  Because that comes as a perk of that room.
[12:47.590 --> 12:49.090]  Yeah, the dice can be used in any room.
[12:49.870 --> 12:51.470]  Oh, this is good.
[12:52.810 --> 12:53.750]  Food for sale.
[12:54.090 --> 12:57.670]  So food will give you more steps, but it costs money.
[12:58.070 --> 12:58.350]  I got money.
[12:58.450 --> 13:01.100]  So you have 26 steps left, so if you want, you can...
[13:01.710 --> 13:02.230]  Have a snack.
[13:02.330 --> 13:03.090]  You can buy food in here.
[13:03.310 --> 13:05.090]  Yeah, you're, like, half-tired right now.
[13:05.090 --> 13:08.510]  I saw that... I didn't realize that it...
[13:08.510 --> 13:09.130]  Ooh, here it is.
[13:10.210 --> 13:10.610]  Fuck.
[13:11.450 --> 13:12.930]  I don't have any money for anything.
[13:14.210 --> 13:15.290]  God damn it!
[13:17.510 --> 13:18.250]  It's a locked door.
[13:18.250 --> 13:19.550]  Another locked fucking door.
[13:19.990 --> 13:25.930]  Well, boys, I think this run might be done, because I didn't realize at first glance that walking backwards also took away my feet.
[13:26.150 --> 13:28.610]  Yeah, any time you go in or out of a room, you lose a step.
[13:28.770 --> 13:29.130]  What?
[13:29.330 --> 13:32.490]  I thought it was just with the new backtrack, and you're also losing steps.
[13:32.490 --> 13:36.010]  But it's okay, because you just take your knowledge the next day.
[13:36.130 --> 13:38.070]  You don't really lose anything, apart from the day.
[13:38.630 --> 13:39.970]  Well, don't you lose this build, though?
[13:40.290 --> 13:41.550]  You still have a right path.
[13:42.170 --> 13:44.510]  Don't you have to restart the entire build the next day?
[13:45.050 --> 13:45.950]  You do, but, like...
[13:45.950 --> 13:46.950]  But you have your knowledge.
[13:48.310 --> 13:49.670]  That doesn't help me.
[13:49.670 --> 13:50.490]  Yeah, I got...
[13:51.150 --> 13:52.210]  That Rompus room...
[13:52.210 --> 13:52.570]  Okay.
[13:53.070 --> 13:54.690]  Man, a Tier 1 Rompus room? Jeez.
[13:55.090 --> 13:56.610]  That Rompus room had $8 in it.
[13:57.850 --> 13:59.190]  Yeah, but this one had $4.
[13:59.950 --> 14:00.330]  Yeah.
[14:00.550 --> 14:01.370]  And an apple.
[14:01.370 --> 14:02.570]  And it leads me the right way?
[14:02.570 --> 14:03.970]  Turn around and eat the... Stop.
[14:04.350 --> 14:04.610]  Whatever.
[14:04.970 --> 14:06.150]  Get the apple.
[14:06.530 --> 14:08.170]  Dude, are you serious?
[14:08.470 --> 14:09.130]  I thought it was set dressing.
[14:10.450 --> 14:12.070]  I thought it was set dressing!
[14:13.910 --> 14:14.950]  That's not what I want.
[14:16.310 --> 14:19.490]  So, I mean, you could go that way, but it would close it off, but you'd get a key.
[14:20.150 --> 14:21.070]  Or you could go security.
[14:21.910 --> 14:23.570]  Or redraw. One time.
[14:24.830 --> 14:26.190]  But you only have one of those left.
[14:27.730 --> 14:29.590]  Those don't continue the next day, right?
[14:30.470 --> 14:30.730]  No.
[14:30.730 --> 14:32.430]  I should get the key, then.
[14:34.230 --> 14:34.770]  Do it.
[14:34.990 --> 14:35.530]  I'm gonna get the key.
[14:37.450 --> 14:40.630]  I feel like there was a lot of judgmental silence when I said that.
[14:40.730 --> 14:40.910]  No.
[14:41.230 --> 14:43.170]  If it helps, I don't know what you're doing.
[14:43.850 --> 14:46.150]  There's no way to be judgmental in this.
[14:47.430 --> 14:49.730]  Oh, okay. I like that it's telling you, like, hey, dumbass.
[14:50.550 --> 14:51.070]  Write it down.
[14:52.430 --> 14:54.610]  To echo Gavin, no judgment first day.
[14:54.910 --> 14:56.470]  By day nine, there will be judgment.
[14:56.510 --> 14:56.730]  Yeah.
[14:57.830 --> 14:58.870]  Is this the right way?
[14:58.870 --> 14:59.950]  Mm-hmm.
[15:00.090 --> 15:00.410]  Yeah.
[15:01.170 --> 15:03.590]  Sorry, I'm not using the right stick, because I'm taking a sip.
[15:04.430 --> 15:06.670]  Yeah, you can hit right trigger at any point to open your mouth.
[15:07.230 --> 15:08.190]  I know, I know where I'm going.
[15:08.210 --> 15:10.250]  I do that in real life. I always strafe when I'm drinking.
[15:11.670 --> 15:12.790]  You're good, dude. You're doing great.
[15:12.910 --> 15:15.790]  Do I want to go straight through the den, or through the kitchen, do you think?
[15:16.510 --> 15:17.650]  Oh, I could save footsteps.
[15:17.650 --> 15:18.630]  Do you want to spend the steps?
[15:18.810 --> 15:19.870]  Yeah. Let's do this.
[15:20.290 --> 15:20.450]  Ooh.
[15:21.850 --> 15:22.170]  Oh.
[15:22.670 --> 15:23.130]  Oh, shit.
[15:23.130 --> 15:24.290]  Well, we can't use the key on that.
[15:29.330 --> 15:30.650]  All right, I'll use it here first.
[15:32.330 --> 15:33.870]  Because I don't have anywhere else to go, do I?
[15:35.410 --> 15:37.130]  Ooh, plus three keys?
[15:38.410 --> 15:41.190]  Ooh, we need that. We need that real good.
[15:42.330 --> 15:44.250]  Let's go ahead and just take those keys.
[15:47.530 --> 15:47.890]  Hello?
[15:48.210 --> 15:48.350]  It's a car.
[15:49.970 --> 15:51.410]  It's a garage with a car in it.
[15:51.550 --> 15:52.350]  Is this phasmophobia?
[15:55.130 --> 15:56.110]  Where are the keys?
[15:56.110 --> 15:58.770]  Christoph is the third time this month in the car. He's gone.
[15:59.770 --> 16:03.330]  I don't care how long you have been driving for his lordship, your absences will be accounted for.
[16:03.730 --> 16:04.130]  I love Downton.
[16:08.550 --> 16:11.250]  It's making me so happy, him trying to find the keys.
[16:11.490 --> 16:12.030]  Where are they?
[16:12.970 --> 16:13.270]  Oh.
[16:14.270 --> 16:15.350]  Right at the door.
[16:16.850 --> 16:17.250]  Hello?
[16:17.610 --> 16:20.350]  Oh, he's dead.
[16:23.310 --> 16:24.090]  Use this.
[16:24.090 --> 16:26.110]  Ooh, immediately going for the trunk.
[16:26.210 --> 16:27.290]  Yeah, I don't know what's in it.
[16:27.350 --> 16:27.650]  Ooh.
[16:27.650 --> 16:28.030]  The key.
[16:28.510 --> 16:30.790]  I was rewarded for my curiosity.
[16:37.010 --> 16:40.150]  I think you need to spend some of them coins, Nick.
[16:40.170 --> 16:40.690]  Yeah, I agree.
[16:41.610 --> 16:43.290]  You have enough for a club sandwich?
[16:43.610 --> 16:45.350]  For every red room in your house.
[16:46.230 --> 16:47.570]  You don't have any red rooms in your house?
[16:47.730 --> 16:47.890]  None.
[16:48.130 --> 16:48.410]  Ooh.
[16:48.790 --> 16:49.730]  I thought he bought it.
[16:51.730 --> 16:53.490]  I gasped when I thought he bought it.
[16:55.210 --> 16:57.950]  And I'll save money in case I get some red rooms.
[17:00.570 --> 17:02.050]  I'll just buy the bananas.
[17:02.730 --> 17:03.650]  Why would you?
[17:03.930 --> 17:04.790]  Oh my god.
[17:05.010 --> 17:07.690]  Why are you asking why?
[17:07.790 --> 17:10.350]  We're getting a peek inside of the sauce.
[17:10.770 --> 17:11.170]  It's day one, no judgment.
[17:12.250 --> 17:13.090]  No judgment.
[17:13.350 --> 17:14.470]  No judgment, day one.
[17:16.310 --> 17:17.190]  Save your judgment.
[17:17.310 --> 17:17.950]  Ooh, a boudoir.
[17:18.650 --> 17:23.150]  I like the hard way that the tomato soup doesn't have a base value at all, so if you have no red rooms...
[17:23.150 --> 17:23.730]  Oh no.
[17:23.970 --> 17:24.530]  It's worthless.
[17:24.950 --> 17:25.350]  Zero.
[17:27.270 --> 17:29.470]  Or you can redraw your floor plan.
[17:29.510 --> 17:30.210]  Oh, I could do that.
[17:30.690 --> 17:31.230]  Let's do that.
[17:33.850 --> 17:35.670]  Whenever you enter this room, gain two.
[17:36.370 --> 17:39.210]  And then inventory of all items currently in the house.
[17:43.750 --> 17:45.170]  That's a dead end, so that would end.
[17:45.670 --> 17:46.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:46.370 --> 17:46.910]  Every bedroom.
[17:47.730 --> 17:48.910]  Unless you've, you know.
[17:50.150 --> 17:50.910]  I don't know.
[17:51.210 --> 17:53.670]  Found other puzzles to solve or something.
[17:53.670 --> 17:54.390]  I got two feet.
[17:54.910 --> 17:55.310]  Ooh.
[17:56.070 --> 17:57.170]  Greetings from Reddington.
[17:57.450 --> 17:57.930]  Looks pretty.
[17:59.130 --> 17:59.570]  Does.
[17:59.970 --> 18:00.710]  Really nice art.
[18:00.910 --> 18:01.290]  Looks real pretty.
[18:01.570 --> 18:01.710]  Yeah.
[18:02.570 --> 18:05.630]  I feel like that's how long someone actually does look at the front of a postcard.
[18:05.970 --> 18:06.190]  Yeah.
[18:06.390 --> 18:07.410]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[18:07.770 --> 18:08.490]  And trash?
[18:08.930 --> 18:12.110]  Each day a meal is served in the dining room after rank eight has been reached.
[18:13.450 --> 18:17.170]  So rank eight is each depth of the room, so you're currently in rank five.
[18:17.190 --> 18:18.850]  Yeah, bottom right tells you your rank.
[18:20.150 --> 18:20.590]  So...
[18:20.590 --> 18:21.250]  I'm gonna go do that.
[18:23.670 --> 18:28.270]  If you can make it three more floors up, that will turn into food.
[18:28.590 --> 18:29.390]  You can come back and eat it.
[18:30.110 --> 18:30.830]  It's worth a lot.
[18:33.570 --> 18:35.350]  Whenever you enter the chapel, lose one.
[18:36.110 --> 18:36.770]  Oh no.
[18:37.510 --> 18:39.050]  You only got two, so that's pretty significant.
[18:39.050 --> 18:39.830]  So that's pretty bad, yeah.
[18:39.830 --> 18:41.110]  You gotta, you gotta tithe.
[18:42.790 --> 18:44.070]  We have two keys though.
[18:44.190 --> 18:45.350]  I'll just do boudoir again.
[18:47.770 --> 18:48.450]  I'm learning.
[18:48.810 --> 18:49.170]  Uh.
[18:50.050 --> 18:50.950]  Fancy little room.
[18:50.990 --> 18:52.070]  A nice little room.
[18:52.510 --> 18:52.870]  Yeah.
[18:54.330 --> 18:55.010]  Record player?
[18:55.150 --> 18:55.570]  I like it.
[18:57.130 --> 18:57.490]  Okay.
[18:58.590 --> 18:59.310]  And chapel?
[19:00.090 --> 19:00.730]  Oh no.
[19:01.650 --> 19:02.010]  This...
[19:02.010 --> 19:03.070]  I guess we're gonna have to...
[19:04.030 --> 19:06.190]  Yeah, but trying to make it back here is gonna be...
[19:06.190 --> 19:07.090]  I don't know how you're gonna do it.
[19:07.930 --> 19:09.350]  Oh, every time you enter.
[19:12.350 --> 19:13.070]  Well, shit.
[19:13.910 --> 19:18.490]  You know, if you want to try to make a positive spin on it, you go in and out twice, there's no more penalty.
[19:18.710 --> 19:19.870]  Yeah, they're not gonna charge it anymore.
[19:21.010 --> 19:22.870]  You can't have negative money.
[19:23.170 --> 19:25.090]  And you can't afford a banana anyway.
[19:25.170 --> 19:25.950]  That's true.
[19:26.030 --> 19:26.250]  You know what?
[19:27.630 --> 19:28.070]  Yeah.
[19:29.990 --> 19:31.510]  Alms for the poor and all that.
[19:32.370 --> 19:33.650]  Now, if you bought the club sandwich.
[19:35.250 --> 19:39.210]  I will say, the observatory is the only room that has another door in it.
[19:39.470 --> 19:40.730]  Yeah, it does look that way.
[19:41.190 --> 19:42.030]  When you're making those choices.
[19:42.450 --> 19:42.730]  Sweet.
[19:43.490 --> 19:44.830]  Well, you talked me into it.
[19:46.830 --> 19:47.270]  Ooh.
[19:47.930 --> 19:48.150]  Ooh.
[19:48.150 --> 19:48.770]  Oh.
[19:49.670 --> 19:50.430]  Yeah, that's good.
[19:51.870 --> 19:54.170]  I'm gonna go ahead and just stop you right there.
[19:54.310 --> 19:56.090]  I spent way too much time spinning those things.
[19:57.590 --> 19:58.190]  Oh, what?
[19:58.410 --> 19:59.410]  That was just a waste of your time.
[20:00.070 --> 20:03.150]  A complete star base, depending on the number of stars that can be seen in the sky on any given day.
[20:03.970 --> 20:04.270]  Oh.
[20:05.130 --> 20:07.950]  So I can get some shit for looking at stars?
[20:08.850 --> 20:09.070]  Yep.
[20:10.430 --> 20:10.790]  Yeah.
[20:11.430 --> 20:12.350]  Gotta look at the stars.
[20:14.010 --> 20:15.850]  Dead end rooms are more common.
[20:16.070 --> 20:17.750]  Oh, that's gonna suck when you find that one.
[20:19.150 --> 20:21.150]  So you just, what, look?
[20:21.270 --> 20:22.290]  Gotta look at the stars.
[20:25.390 --> 20:26.770]  No stars that way.
[20:27.030 --> 20:27.130]  What?
[20:28.090 --> 20:29.190]  Do I have to hold it?
[20:32.910 --> 20:34.870]  Definitely getting closer to the stars.
[20:34.950 --> 20:36.190]  Oh, okay, I see what it's doing.
[20:36.190 --> 20:37.330]  I see what it's doing.
[20:37.630 --> 20:38.550]  I see what it's doing.
[20:38.570 --> 20:39.240]  Closer still.
[20:41.490 --> 20:41.950]  Warmer.
[20:42.210 --> 20:45.690]  I see it, I'm learning the goddamn thing.
[20:45.690 --> 20:48.490]  I think you bashed it into the wall there.
[20:48.590 --> 20:49.490]  Why is it going the other way?
[20:49.790 --> 20:51.010]  Because you're spinning it the other way.
[20:51.050 --> 20:52.130]  Because you can't go anymore the other way.
[20:52.250 --> 20:53.930]  But it wasn't aimed at the window yet.
[20:54.890 --> 20:55.250]  Interesting.
[20:56.190 --> 20:58.770]  Whichever side of the wheel you look at, I assume, spins it that way.
[21:00.510 --> 21:01.110]  Colder, Nick.
[21:01.450 --> 21:02.270]  Very cold.
[21:02.470 --> 21:03.150]  You're getting so cold.
[21:03.250 --> 21:05.850]  Why would they, why would it be a mechanic to do that?
[21:05.930 --> 21:06.690]  Alright, makes sense.
[21:06.810 --> 21:07.170]  That's all good.
[21:07.450 --> 21:07.830]  Got it.
[21:07.870 --> 21:08.370]  You're the mechanic.
[21:10.270 --> 21:10.990]  He is.
[21:12.070 --> 21:12.310]  Oh.
[21:12.630 --> 21:13.230]  The mechanick.
[21:15.250 --> 21:16.190]  There we go.
[21:17.290 --> 21:17.690]  Nope.
[21:18.030 --> 21:19.170]  Very close.
[21:19.390 --> 21:20.890]  Go right side.
[21:21.530 --> 21:21.930]  Bonk.
[21:21.990 --> 21:23.110]  Fucking bonk!
[21:24.150 --> 21:24.550]  Bonk.
[21:25.850 --> 21:26.650]  Is it...
[21:29.130 --> 21:29.530]  Bonk.
[21:29.990 --> 21:30.950]  Oh, I'm so glad you're doing this.
[21:30.950 --> 21:32.590]  Oh, it needs to go higher, I see.
[21:32.770 --> 21:34.250]  I see, I get it.
[21:34.330 --> 21:34.710]  I get it.
[21:34.710 --> 21:35.410]  How do I do that?
[21:36.370 --> 21:37.730]  What do I...
[21:37.730 --> 21:39.390]  Doesn't appear to be that.
[21:40.910 --> 21:41.810]  Oh, does it not?
[21:41.810 --> 21:43.450]  You don't think this big windy thing?
[21:44.150 --> 21:46.850]  Andrew with the condescending nudges.
[21:47.070 --> 21:49.230]  No, I'm just saying it doesn't appear to be that.
[21:52.710 --> 21:53.970]  There we go.
[21:54.910 --> 21:55.250]  Why...
[21:55.250 --> 21:55.530]  Okay.
[21:56.530 --> 21:56.970]  Why...
[21:56.970 --> 21:57.970]  No, it's finish it.
[21:58.170 --> 21:58.950]  Why what?
[21:59.790 --> 22:00.370]  Oh, it's higher.
[22:00.410 --> 22:00.850]  Why up there?
[22:01.130 --> 22:01.290]  You raised it.
[22:01.590 --> 22:02.050]  You did it.
[22:02.330 --> 22:02.910]  I raised it.
[22:03.010 --> 22:03.310]  Excellent.
[22:04.610 --> 22:05.550]  Alright, day one.
[22:05.730 --> 22:06.090]  Assholes.
[22:08.410 --> 22:09.230]  Let's calm down.
[22:09.950 --> 22:10.610]  Everybody just chill.
[22:11.230 --> 22:12.250]  Mr. I won't play this game.
[22:14.290 --> 22:15.550]  Alright, let's take a look.
[22:16.010 --> 22:16.570]  There you go.
[22:16.690 --> 22:17.430]  I did it.
[22:17.530 --> 22:17.790]  A star.
[22:17.790 --> 22:18.310]  There it is.
[22:18.470 --> 22:19.030]  A star.
[22:19.870 --> 22:20.550]  You gotta click it.
[22:20.990 --> 22:21.630]  You got it.
[22:21.810 --> 22:22.630]  You gotta click it, dude.
[22:22.970 --> 22:24.030]  You gotta click it, man.
[22:24.110 --> 22:24.610]  Click it.
[22:25.110 --> 22:25.570]  Push A.
[22:25.990 --> 22:26.330]  Hit it.
[22:26.410 --> 22:26.810]  There you go.
[22:26.950 --> 22:27.490]  There you go.
[22:27.550 --> 22:27.970]  North star.
[22:28.030 --> 22:28.250]  Why?
[22:28.490 --> 22:28.850]  Why?
[22:29.030 --> 22:29.190]  Why?
[22:29.210 --> 22:29.890]  Why wouldn't it just...
[22:29.890 --> 22:30.390]  Ah, fuck it.
[22:31.110 --> 22:31.630]  One buck.
[22:32.010 --> 22:36.610]  Because you can theoretically learn what the constellations are and then decide if you
[22:36.610 --> 22:37.570]  want that thing or not.
[22:38.810 --> 22:43.570]  Like if you don't want the stupid dead-end rooms, don't click it.
[22:43.830 --> 22:44.970]  Items laying around your house.
[22:45.050 --> 22:45.770]  Well, that's not good.
[22:47.670 --> 22:48.290]  Is it?
[22:50.070 --> 22:50.510]  No.
[22:50.750 --> 22:50.910]  Okay.
[22:51.430 --> 22:52.170]  Security it is.
[22:52.390 --> 22:53.510]  Generally, red rooms are bad.
[22:53.790 --> 22:54.010]  Yeah.
[22:54.170 --> 22:55.530]  As far as like what they...
[22:55.530 --> 22:56.050]  Oh, what is that?
[22:56.070 --> 22:56.530]  Is that a negative?
[22:57.290 --> 22:59.170]  There's a negative to all red rooms.
[23:02.050 --> 23:03.190]  I feel like he's tied it up.
[23:04.470 --> 23:04.770]  Hey.
[23:05.830 --> 23:06.750]  That's what he's watching.
[23:06.750 --> 23:07.710]  The important stuff, you know?
[23:07.710 --> 23:09.550]  MLB on every TV in this room.
[23:11.930 --> 23:13.550]  Whoa, the Philly's tied up.
[23:15.850 --> 23:17.130]  Where's the Philly's game?
[23:20.210 --> 23:22.870]  Why don't any of these screens show clown in a cornfield?
[23:23.550 --> 23:25.830]  Try to turn this place into a Buffalo Wild Wings.
[23:27.150 --> 23:29.410]  Over 30 screens with different action.
[23:34.680 --> 23:36.280]  I thought you turned off the recorder.
[23:52.560 --> 23:53.040]  Wow.
[23:57.760 --> 23:59.260]  All I need is wings.
[24:11.000 --> 24:11.880]  Music room.
[24:14.180 --> 24:15.660]  They nailed the music in this game.
[24:17.300 --> 24:18.180]  That's me.
[24:18.980 --> 24:19.860]  That's me.
[24:20.740 --> 24:21.180]  Boop.
[24:28.820 --> 24:31.700]  I think it was at this point where I was like, is this a horror game?
[24:32.560 --> 24:32.900]  Oh, yeah.
[24:34.020 --> 24:35.240]  View estate inventory.
[24:38.300 --> 24:39.720]  So you haven't missed anything.
[24:39.760 --> 24:40.300]  Oh, I see.
[24:41.260 --> 24:41.820]  Got it, got it.
[24:41.820 --> 24:43.680]  But if you didn't eat the apple, it would say one fruit.
[24:45.420 --> 24:48.760]  There's actually nothing worse than seeing that you're missing stuff,
[24:48.820 --> 24:49.960]  because it's like, where the fuck...
[24:50.620 --> 24:51.480]  That doesn't mean...
[24:51.480 --> 24:53.480]  Like, I know it's there, but I don't know where to begin.
[24:53.560 --> 24:54.460]  I have steps to worry about.
[24:54.500 --> 24:55.640]  Wait, are you shitting me?
[24:55.740 --> 24:57.100]  So do I need a card for these?
[24:58.040 --> 24:58.440]  Yes.
[25:00.240 --> 25:01.660]  Or another way around it.
[25:02.320 --> 25:03.400]  Or another way around it.
[25:04.080 --> 25:05.680]  Another way around it.
[25:10.420 --> 25:10.820]  Coffee.
[25:15.400 --> 25:15.920]  Ooh.
[25:16.960 --> 25:18.200]  Effective the first week of December.
[25:18.340 --> 25:19.740]  Payroll for all live...
[25:19.740 --> 25:21.060]  Terminal password.
[25:22.160 --> 25:24.240]  Yeah, if you can read that, then you have the password.
[25:25.820 --> 25:26.340]  Terminal...
[25:27.060 --> 25:27.580]  Schnimmimin.
[25:28.820 --> 25:29.580]  That's it.
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.640]  Try schnimmimin.
[25:33.640 --> 25:35.260]  Try clown in a cornfield.
[25:39.600 --> 25:40.120]  Okay.
[25:44.840 --> 25:45.540]  What's the ante?
[25:46.320 --> 25:48.720]  It's just two rows above you.
[25:48.720 --> 25:49.200]  Oh.
[25:49.460 --> 25:50.600]  Got it.
[25:50.660 --> 25:51.160]  Rank nine.
[25:57.240 --> 25:57.720]  Okay.
[25:58.500 --> 25:58.980]  Sweet.
[26:03.790 --> 26:04.750]  So, uh...
[26:04.750 --> 26:05.030]  Huh.
[26:06.630 --> 26:07.110]  Schnimmimin.
[26:07.430 --> 26:08.450]  Let me get a picture of this.
[26:08.490 --> 26:08.970]  Schnimmimin.
[26:09.510 --> 26:11.690]  It looks like it ends in ing, almost.
[26:11.910 --> 26:12.570]  But it's not right.
[26:12.810 --> 26:13.430]  Let me look here.
[26:13.610 --> 26:13.810]  Alright.
[26:14.390 --> 26:14.870]  Picture.
[26:16.030 --> 26:16.510]  Spunking.
[26:17.630 --> 26:19.390]  You gonna try to zoom in on a photo?
[26:20.350 --> 26:20.810]  No.
[26:21.510 --> 26:21.970]  Maybe.
[26:22.270 --> 26:22.510]  Okay.
[26:22.730 --> 26:23.590]  Do I enter it here?
[26:26.590 --> 26:27.870]  Log into network.
[26:28.270 --> 26:28.630]  Ah.
[26:29.530 --> 26:30.530]  Need that password.
[26:30.690 --> 26:31.870]  That's a long-ass password.
[26:34.110 --> 26:36.410]  Wait, do you have to go by letter on console?
[26:37.090 --> 26:37.450]  Yes.
[26:37.810 --> 26:38.430]  Oh, man.
[26:38.790 --> 26:39.670]  Yeah, it sucks.
[26:40.050 --> 26:40.490]  Oh, wow.
[26:41.050 --> 26:42.830]  But once you have the...
[26:42.830 --> 26:44.110]  Just so you guys know, if you don't already know,
[26:44.210 --> 26:45.630]  once you have already done it once,
[26:45.650 --> 26:47.350]  if you just hit left trigger, it autofills it.
[26:47.950 --> 26:48.610]  Oh, that's cool.
[26:48.610 --> 26:49.250]  Yeah.
[26:49.410 --> 26:49.770]  Ah.
[26:50.790 --> 26:51.510]  That's great.
[26:52.270 --> 26:54.190]  Yeah, I found that out about 25 hours in.
[26:54.510 --> 26:54.670]  Yeah.
[26:56.110 --> 26:56.930]  I played on PC.
[26:56.930 --> 26:58.170]  So this is Game Pass?
[26:58.410 --> 26:58.990]  Yeah, this is Game Pass.
[26:59.070 --> 26:59.270]  Yes.
[26:59.490 --> 27:00.390]  Ah, son of a bitch.
[27:00.410 --> 27:01.130]  I keep doing that.
[27:02.490 --> 27:03.730]  I keep buying stuff on Steam.
[27:03.730 --> 27:05.370]  I think it's even on PC, Game Pass.
[27:05.710 --> 27:05.790]  Is it?
[27:05.790 --> 27:06.810]  Did you buy Oblivion too?
[27:07.110 --> 27:07.750]  I'm pretty sure.
[27:08.250 --> 27:09.610]  Did you buy Oblivion?
[27:09.770 --> 27:10.330]  It's on Game Pass.
[27:10.330 --> 27:10.970]  Yeah, should I not have?
[27:11.210 --> 27:11.890]  Ah, son of a bitch!
[27:11.890 --> 27:13.450]  It's on Game Pass, dude!
[27:15.090 --> 27:15.770]  Alright, well.
[27:17.150 --> 27:17.990]  You gotta go down.
[27:17.990 --> 27:18.590]  Alright.
[27:18.950 --> 27:19.890]  A passageway.
[27:20.070 --> 27:20.110]  Ooh!
[27:20.430 --> 27:21.190]  A nursery.
[27:21.550 --> 27:22.990]  So I guess I just am doing...
[27:24.370 --> 27:25.670]  You only have one choice here.
[27:26.770 --> 27:27.510]  I have no gems.
[27:27.530 --> 27:27.890]  No, you don't.
[27:29.350 --> 27:29.710]  So...
[27:29.710 --> 27:30.210]  There you go.
[27:30.290 --> 27:31.470]  I guess I'm done for the day, huh?
[27:31.650 --> 27:32.470]  Yeah, that'll be it.
[27:32.510 --> 27:33.010]  Some bunk rooms.
[27:33.550 --> 27:34.610]  What does a bunk room give me?
[27:34.930 --> 27:36.190]  Does it matter at this point?
[27:37.290 --> 27:37.850]  It could.
[27:38.450 --> 27:38.790]  Ooh!
[27:38.850 --> 27:39.670]  You never know what you might find.
[27:40.670 --> 27:41.770]  Oh, there's gems you needed.
[27:41.970 --> 27:42.250]  Oh!
[27:42.550 --> 27:42.810]  Oh.
[27:44.030 --> 27:44.390]  Oh.
[27:46.190 --> 27:47.570]  Ooh, Atari.
[27:47.570 --> 27:49.510]  No, you can't look at the VHS or anything?
[27:49.650 --> 27:51.170]  There's no...
[27:51.170 --> 27:52.010]  Can't grab a tape?
[27:52.610 --> 27:52.930]  Can't...
[27:52.930 --> 27:53.170]  No.
[27:53.430 --> 27:53.750]  No.
[27:54.310 --> 27:54.630]  No.
[27:55.050 --> 27:55.330]  No.
[27:55.510 --> 27:55.750]  No.
[27:55.950 --> 27:56.390]  Can you...
[27:56.390 --> 27:57.170]  Is there a crouch button?
[27:58.410 --> 27:59.170]  There's no crouch.
[27:59.250 --> 27:59.410]  No.
[27:59.550 --> 27:59.610]  Okay.
[28:00.750 --> 28:01.230]  Ooh, a flashlight.
[28:02.050 --> 28:03.010]  There is a back flip, though.
[28:03.730 --> 28:04.370]  Oh, nice.
[28:04.570 --> 28:05.310]  Can you grab the ore?
[28:05.450 --> 28:05.770]  Or no?
[28:06.330 --> 28:06.970]  I'm just curious.
[28:07.030 --> 28:09.090]  I just wanna see if there's anything in this room that you can do anything with.
[28:10.110 --> 28:10.430]  Uh...
[28:10.430 --> 28:10.970]  Can't grab that.
[28:11.090 --> 28:11.310]  Can't grab that.
[28:11.310 --> 28:11.550]  Ooh!
[28:11.670 --> 28:11.990]  A hamster!
[28:12.950 --> 28:13.370]  It's Eric!
[28:13.470 --> 28:13.910]  A hamster?
[28:13.910 --> 28:15.450]  There's things that live in here?
[28:17.790 --> 28:18.170]  Ooh.
[28:18.610 --> 28:19.590]  Today is a good day.
[28:19.930 --> 28:20.570]  Simon, I can't.
[28:23.050 --> 28:24.910]  Having a younger brother is not as much fun.
[28:26.130 --> 28:27.850]  But today is a good day because he's at camp.
[28:27.970 --> 28:29.090]  Man, that's a cool story, kid.
[28:33.130 --> 28:33.890]  Just, uh...
[28:35.030 --> 28:35.410]  What?
[28:35.850 --> 28:36.670]  Did I miss something else?
[28:37.930 --> 28:39.050]  Oh, next page!
[28:39.750 --> 28:40.030]  Herbie...
[28:41.110 --> 28:44.830]  Herbie is mean and is really stupid and today is a good day because I threw away his airplane.
[28:44.950 --> 28:45.350]  What a dick.
[28:45.690 --> 28:48.150]  I also had more fun at camp than he had in his entire...
[28:48.150 --> 28:48.650]  Oh, he's dead.
[28:51.690 --> 28:53.970]  I got more than trouble for reading my private journal without my permission
[28:53.970 --> 28:56.190]  and writing mean things yellow through my model airplane in the bushes outside.
[28:56.250 --> 28:58.430]  If he does it again, I will not get to go to the park on Friday
[28:58.430 --> 29:00.130]  and I will make sure he gets no presents for his birthday.
[29:01.230 --> 29:02.510]  Hey, he spelled presents wrong, idiot.
[29:03.490 --> 29:03.770]  Uh...
[29:03.770 --> 29:07.310]  He loves his book because he won't stop writing about me and today is a good day because I do.
[29:07.310 --> 29:09.090]  He cries when he can't find his book even though...
[29:09.090 --> 29:09.890]  Good God!
[29:14.280 --> 29:16.120]  I honestly have no idea how we survived sharing a room.
[29:16.200 --> 29:19.120]  All things being said, I still would rather have a dad and a sister.
[29:21.320 --> 29:21.720]  Alright.
[29:23.220 --> 29:23.800]  That's cool.
[29:23.800 --> 29:24.100]  That's very sweet.
[29:24.380 --> 29:25.280]  Very, very sweet.
[29:26.200 --> 29:28.360]  You don't really realize that until you're a bunch older.
[29:29.160 --> 29:30.020]  So now you're...
[29:30.020 --> 29:32.500]  There's no more places for you to, like, progress.
[29:32.880 --> 29:34.120]  But if you want...
[29:34.120 --> 29:36.200]  You can use your seven steps to explore.
[29:36.920 --> 29:38.280]  Check rooms out if you want.
[29:38.280 --> 29:39.780]  You can just walk around.
[29:40.580 --> 29:42.100]  To rooms I've been through already, you mean?
[29:42.560 --> 29:42.860]  Yeah.
[29:44.600 --> 29:46.020]  Maybe you noticed something.
[29:46.720 --> 29:49.140]  Maybe I noticed something. I doubt it.
[29:50.080 --> 29:51.060]  Have you met me?
[29:52.400 --> 29:53.720]  I've been watching you play.
[29:56.000 --> 29:56.980]  What did I miss?
[29:57.340 --> 29:57.840]  A cat!
[29:59.640 --> 30:00.780]  You can pull its tail.
[30:01.840 --> 30:01.980]  Meow?
[30:03.020 --> 30:04.200]  No, you can't. You lied.
[30:04.200 --> 30:04.460]  Insect.
[30:06.900 --> 30:08.040]  Wall? Door?
[30:08.300 --> 30:08.640]  Ooh, stuff.
[30:08.800 --> 30:10.280]  I think there's...
[30:10.280 --> 30:11.420]  I think there's what now?
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.200]  I think there's...
[30:15.660 --> 30:16.440]  A painting.
[30:16.780 --> 30:18.420]  There we go. I don't think you've seen that yet.
[30:19.420 --> 30:21.340]  Why does he look like Slappy from Goosebumps?
[30:21.860 --> 30:22.880]  He does look like Slappy.
[30:22.900 --> 30:23.520]  He does!
[30:23.660 --> 30:25.340]  He does kind of look like Slappy.
[30:27.260 --> 30:28.140]  Ooh, fireplace.
[30:28.620 --> 30:28.700]  Oh.
[30:29.900 --> 30:31.040]  Ooh, clock.
[30:31.360 --> 30:32.100]  Ooh, candelabra.
[30:32.460 --> 30:32.660]  Whoa!
[30:32.660 --> 30:34.060]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[30:34.060 --> 30:34.680]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[30:34.840 --> 30:35.000]  What?
[30:35.920 --> 30:36.740]  Go back to the candelabra.
[30:38.940 --> 30:43.200]  Did you just find that without looking at the clue for it?
[30:43.600 --> 30:44.400]  The hand popped up.
[30:44.760 --> 30:45.340]  There's a clue?
[30:46.440 --> 30:48.980]  Nick, go back to the drawing of him.
[30:50.860 --> 30:51.940]  Look over his left shoulder.
[30:54.880 --> 30:55.280]  Stupid.
[30:55.360 --> 30:57.520]  I felt really smart when I noticed it in the picture.
[30:57.820 --> 30:58.600]  Yeah, so did I.
[30:59.220 --> 31:00.220]  I'm a genius.
[31:00.580 --> 31:01.780]  I wonder how many people just click it.
[31:01.780 --> 31:04.020]  I found it the way Nick found it.
[31:06.440 --> 31:06.920]  Activate it?
[31:07.020 --> 31:07.560]  Does it say anything?
[31:07.820 --> 31:08.580]  If you activate that?
[31:09.080 --> 31:10.120]  Does it just give you the keypad?
[31:10.220 --> 31:11.060]  It just gives you the keypad.
[31:11.620 --> 31:11.860]  Okay.
[31:12.300 --> 31:12.980]  Back out.
[31:13.280 --> 31:13.420]  Yeah.
[31:14.240 --> 31:15.160]  I could try boobs.
[31:18.040 --> 31:18.660]  Hang on.
[31:19.020 --> 31:19.360]  Hang on.
[31:19.400 --> 31:20.320]  Look at the... stop.
[31:20.720 --> 31:21.800]  Stop moving!
[31:21.980 --> 31:22.580]  I'm gonna kill you.
[31:22.720 --> 31:23.660]  I'm gonna kill you!
[31:23.960 --> 31:24.200]  What?
[31:24.320 --> 31:25.040]  What do you want me to do?
[31:25.040 --> 31:30.220]  Go look at... turn around and look at the writing that was on the table.
[31:30.460 --> 31:31.540]  That paper.
[31:31.800 --> 31:32.340]  That's about rooms.
[31:33.180 --> 31:33.540]  Okay.
[31:33.760 --> 31:36.060]  Is there anything else in here to read?
[31:36.520 --> 31:39.040]  All of these pictures are like repeating, right?
[31:39.280 --> 31:40.220]  They're like the same...
[31:41.600 --> 31:42.280]  Wait, hold on.
[31:43.220 --> 31:43.520]  Okay.
[31:43.860 --> 31:44.100]  Okay.
[31:45.740 --> 31:50.620]  Like, there's horses with long lines, but horses facing backwards with like the same lines.
[31:50.900 --> 31:53.520]  There's three guys, but these guys have short lines.
[31:53.520 --> 31:54.760]  Like, what is the thing?
[31:59.090 --> 31:59.930]  Jesus Christ.
[32:00.650 --> 32:01.850]  I get why you have to write shit down.
[32:02.050 --> 32:02.670]  This sucks.
[32:03.010 --> 32:04.170]  Fuck escape rooms.
[32:04.630 --> 32:05.610]  This sucks.
[32:06.490 --> 32:08.130]  This is fucking awful.
[32:08.170 --> 32:08.870]  I'll be honest with you, Nick.
[32:08.890 --> 32:12.710]  I'm like 68 days in and I haven't figured out this safe.
[32:13.790 --> 32:14.210]  Okay.
[32:14.750 --> 32:15.830]  You have to...
[32:15.830 --> 32:19.290]  I have and it is a complete and utter bullshit.
[32:19.470 --> 32:19.970]  I'll say that.
[32:20.090 --> 32:20.450]  Oh, okay.
[32:20.450 --> 32:26.510]  It seems like it is things with three would be one thing.
[32:26.610 --> 32:28.610]  Things with one long because it's...
[32:29.350 --> 32:30.170]  There's one short.
[32:30.350 --> 32:30.850]  There's short.
[32:31.010 --> 32:31.770]  There's long.
[32:33.010 --> 32:34.570]  There's like no medium lines.
[32:34.710 --> 32:35.490]  There's strides.
[32:38.010 --> 32:39.050]  Short steps.
[32:41.490 --> 32:42.430]  How many...
[32:42.430 --> 32:44.610]  Can you just go put in like four zeros or something?
[32:44.710 --> 32:46.650]  How many things do we need for this?
[32:47.870 --> 32:48.250]  Let's find out.
[32:50.610 --> 32:51.450]  Oh, it doesn't...
[32:52.750 --> 32:53.950]  It just lets you go on infinitely.
[32:54.150 --> 32:54.630]  You have to hit it.
[32:56.110 --> 32:57.570]  Maybe it's a hundred zeros.
[32:58.270 --> 32:59.550]  Don't think it's a hundred zeros.
[33:00.290 --> 33:01.070]  That would be bullshit.
[33:01.350 --> 33:01.930]  Hit clear.
[33:02.190 --> 33:03.770]  One, two, three, four.
[33:03.970 --> 33:04.190]  No!
[33:07.010 --> 33:08.710]  Trying to resuscitate the safe?
[33:09.210 --> 33:10.630]  It has to be...
[33:11.090 --> 33:11.670]  Staying alive.
[33:14.640 --> 33:18.340]  And I will say that this is a game where sometimes you'll look at a thing and go like,
[33:18.340 --> 33:19.640]  Oh, this is clearly a puzzle.
[33:19.820 --> 33:23.260]  And then you'll find a note later that gives context to what you need.
[33:23.600 --> 33:24.620]  Does the clock have any...
[33:24.620 --> 33:25.360]  Is there a clock in here?
[33:28.820 --> 33:29.300]  Twelve...
[33:29.300 --> 33:29.960]  Twenty.
[33:32.700 --> 33:33.180]  Twelve...
[33:33.180 --> 33:33.800]  Twenty-one.
[33:35.980 --> 33:36.460]  Twelve...
[33:36.460 --> 33:37.160]  Twenty-two.
[33:38.920 --> 33:42.580]  Wait, how would you dial...
[33:42.580 --> 33:43.340]  How would you dial...
[33:44.860 --> 33:45.480]  Go on.
[33:46.340 --> 33:48.820]  What if you need to stick your finger in the covered hole?
[33:50.180 --> 33:51.760]  You just kind of pull it, I think.
[33:52.380 --> 33:53.020]  Oh, okay.
[33:54.780 --> 33:56.040]  Alright, Nick, I'll see what you want to do.
[33:58.300 --> 34:00.500]  So you can just call it a day if you want to from the menu.
[34:00.800 --> 34:02.680]  You don't need to burn out your steps if you don't feel like it.
[34:03.140 --> 34:04.220]  Call it a day.
[34:05.080 --> 34:06.300]  I don't want to learn shit.
[34:06.460 --> 34:06.800]  Fuck yeah.
[34:08.200 --> 34:10.740]  Okay, well, he made it sound like we should do that.
[34:13.880 --> 34:14.200]  Wow.
[34:14.200 --> 34:15.400]  What's a summary of your day?
[34:15.900 --> 34:17.160]  We just went and explored a room.
[34:17.360 --> 34:18.520]  Found something that like...
[34:18.520 --> 34:20.680]  Oh, wow, yeah, we hadn't figured this out in like a while.
[34:21.500 --> 34:22.500]  Yeah, fuck it.
[34:23.640 --> 34:24.040]  Yeah.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.300]  We found two items.
[34:26.700 --> 34:27.280]  Way to go.
[34:27.600 --> 34:28.100]  We found stuff.
[34:29.140 --> 34:29.620]  We learned.
[34:29.800 --> 34:31.900]  There's also outside of the mansion.
[34:32.320 --> 34:32.960]  Nick, you might want to...
[34:33.420 --> 34:35.260]  Like, turn around and go outside?
[34:35.420 --> 34:35.600]  Yeah.
[34:36.080 --> 34:36.460]  Oh, wow.
[34:38.180 --> 34:40.440]  That seems like a hit, though.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.140]  Well, just there are places you can explore.
[34:45.920 --> 34:47.100]  Oh, we should take a shovel.
[34:47.200 --> 34:47.740]  Do you still have the shovel or no?
[34:48.440 --> 34:48.800]  No.
[34:48.980 --> 34:49.880]  No, you lose.
[34:49.880 --> 34:50.180]  Nothing.
[34:50.640 --> 34:53.660]  He has the star still.
[34:53.920 --> 34:54.420]  Oh, sweet.
[34:55.040 --> 34:58.420]  Literally the first thing I did on day one is I turned around and ran out here.
[34:59.180 --> 35:00.660]  You think there's anything worth looking at?
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.740]  I'm not saying that.
[35:02.820 --> 35:03.580]  I'm just saying you can.
[35:03.960 --> 35:04.220]  Sweet.
[35:06.300 --> 35:06.720]  Nope.
[35:07.220 --> 35:09.640]  Yeah, you're never going to be able to get through there.
[35:09.640 --> 35:10.760]  That'd be impossible.
[35:11.260 --> 35:13.020]  A well-timed somersault, though.
[35:13.420 --> 35:13.600]  Yeah.
[35:14.580 --> 35:15.680]  Hit the backflip button.
[35:15.880 --> 35:16.640]  Yeah, use the backflip button.
[35:16.700 --> 35:17.600]  I assume this is to leave?
[35:17.600 --> 35:18.840]  I don't think you're supposed to leave the ground.
[35:18.980 --> 35:19.340]  Oh, goodbye.
[35:19.640 --> 35:19.820]  Okay.
[35:21.000 --> 35:21.980]  I don't want to inherit.
[35:23.180 --> 35:23.540]  Ooh.
[35:24.820 --> 35:25.100]  Oh.
[35:26.660 --> 35:27.320]  No screwdriver.
[35:29.200 --> 35:29.600]  Ooh.
[35:30.360 --> 35:30.700]  We're back.
[35:33.140 --> 35:33.860]  Nick is crazy.
[35:34.140 --> 35:34.400]  What?
[35:34.440 --> 35:35.500]  Nick is a crazy person.
[35:35.500 --> 35:36.260]  What are you talking about?
[35:36.740 --> 35:37.040]  What?
[35:37.220 --> 35:37.860]  No judgment.
[35:37.860 --> 35:41.720]  I cannot believe that just fucking happened.
[35:41.840 --> 35:42.400]  What are you talking about?
[35:42.920 --> 35:44.460]  Are you for real?
[35:44.760 --> 35:44.920]  What?
[35:45.020 --> 35:46.780]  He's like a golden retriever.
[35:46.920 --> 35:52.900]  He just gets distracted, and then it's like the thing he was doing never existed.
[35:53.120 --> 35:53.940]  It doesn't work.
[35:54.080 --> 35:54.460]  Yeah.
[35:54.980 --> 35:56.140]  No, yeah, it is blocked.
[35:56.260 --> 35:57.300]  There you go.
[35:58.060 --> 36:00.540]  Well, I assumed that it would dead-end there for some reason.
[36:02.420 --> 36:04.000]  Based on what?
[36:04.340 --> 36:04.600]  The game.
[36:06.940 --> 36:07.420]  Mechanics.
[36:08.140 --> 36:09.500]  This is where you sleep.
[36:09.540 --> 36:10.600]  What mechanic?
[36:11.280 --> 36:12.120]  Oh, my God.
[36:12.600 --> 36:13.420]  Me, I'm the mechanic.
[36:14.100 --> 36:14.500]  There you go.
[36:14.940 --> 36:16.160]  You found your house.
[36:17.060 --> 36:19.600]  Oh, you may call it a day at any time.
[36:19.860 --> 36:20.180]  Okay.
[36:21.840 --> 36:23.580]  So I'm just camping out here?
[36:23.940 --> 36:24.440]  Yeah.
[36:24.560 --> 36:25.880]  Yeah, because you're not allowed to sleep.
[36:25.880 --> 36:26.520]  Yeah, you're not allowed to stay in there.
[36:27.480 --> 36:28.940]  Is this for real?
[36:30.320 --> 36:31.240]  I don't...
[36:31.240 --> 36:32.560]  I don't understand.
[36:32.640 --> 36:33.000]  What do you mean?
[36:34.200 --> 36:35.740]  I could hop this.
[36:37.860 --> 36:39.340]  Yeah, just hit the backflip button.
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.420]  Just maybe step on that stump and then, yeah.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.060]  I could literally walk across it.
[36:47.300 --> 36:49.980]  Or you could figure out a four-digit code.
[36:50.960 --> 36:52.980]  Well, I guess we'll have to figure it out inside.
[36:53.740 --> 36:54.520]  Please turn around.
[36:54.840 --> 36:55.360]  Please turn around.
[36:55.840 --> 36:56.180]  For what?
[36:56.820 --> 36:58.680]  Eric, you decided not to play.
[36:58.940 --> 36:59.560]  You didn't want to.
[36:59.760 --> 37:00.180]  For what?
[37:00.280 --> 37:00.780]  What do you want?
[37:00.940 --> 37:01.120]  This?
[37:01.940 --> 37:03.480]  But it killed me the first time.
[37:03.480 --> 37:08.120]  Yeah, I wanted to see if the gate did anything because you've opened other ones.
[37:08.300 --> 37:09.620]  No, I didn't.
[37:09.640 --> 37:10.340]  Oh, my God.
[37:10.640 --> 37:11.440]  These were open already.
[37:13.740 --> 37:18.220]  When he stopped at this door and turned around, it's like the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[37:18.380 --> 37:19.120]  I don't think I'm wrong.
[37:20.200 --> 37:21.880]  I mean, look at this. I didn't touch this. It was open.
[37:23.180 --> 37:24.680]  Right, you're down 43 steps.
[37:26.060 --> 37:26.500]  Oh, man.
[37:27.200 --> 37:29.860]  I love what just happened right there.
[37:30.240 --> 37:30.420]  What?
[37:31.560 --> 37:32.980]  You don't know what I'm talking about, Andrew?
[37:33.500 --> 37:34.220]  Mm-hmm.
[37:35.100 --> 37:36.420]  I'm sure I did the same.
[37:36.900 --> 37:37.180]  What?
[37:37.400 --> 37:39.540]  There's so much to take in at the beginning that you can't...
[37:41.740 --> 37:43.540]  I definitely didn't do the same thing.
[37:43.660 --> 37:47.080]  No, absolutely not. I didn't look at it and go, oh, look, there's something down there.
[37:47.180 --> 37:48.300]  Okay, I'll keep going the other way.
[37:52.680 --> 37:53.040]  41?
[37:53.900 --> 37:55.500]  Oh, whatever. It's a wasted day.
[37:57.720 --> 37:58.900]  Didn't see the stairs.
[38:00.060 --> 38:00.780]  Oh, cool.
[38:00.780 --> 38:05.160]  I think Gavin's play style matches mine a little bit in this.
[38:08.100 --> 38:08.780]  Ooh, pipe.
[38:08.920 --> 38:12.220]  I would like to go back somehow and watch a video of me playing the first few days there.
[38:12.500 --> 38:15.180]  It's interesting that you noticed that pipe, Nick. I'll say that.
[38:16.200 --> 38:17.320]  Don't give him hints.
[38:17.480 --> 38:19.180]  That's not a hint. I just never noticed it.
[38:19.740 --> 38:22.180]  He like zeroed in on it right there. I never saw that pipe.
[38:22.520 --> 38:23.120]  Ooh, pipe.
[38:23.280 --> 38:23.840]  Ooh, there's two of them.
[38:25.360 --> 38:26.180]  Okay, well, I can't do it.
[38:26.180 --> 38:26.560]  Two pipe.
[38:27.000 --> 38:27.340]  Two pipe.
[38:28.140 --> 38:28.720]  Three pipe?
[38:29.320 --> 38:29.680]  Three pipe?
[38:29.680 --> 38:30.660]  No, that's birdbath.
[38:31.820 --> 38:33.060]  Why are there so many birdbaths?
[38:33.380 --> 38:35.020]  Oh, two pipe. No, no three pipe.
[38:35.200 --> 38:36.280]  No, birdbath, not pipe.
[38:36.360 --> 38:36.520]  No, pipe.
[38:36.760 --> 38:39.000]  This place is known for its dirty birds.
[38:45.210 --> 38:46.290]  Ooh, this is creepy.
[38:53.940 --> 38:55.320]  Okay, it's there a way to light these.
[38:56.260 --> 38:57.920]  Oh, shit.
[39:00.620 --> 39:02.420]  It's a clown, not in a cornfield.
[39:03.620 --> 39:04.400]  Clown in the cavern.
[39:05.640 --> 39:07.820]  And now you're ready to take on the house.
[39:09.060 --> 39:11.340]  Let's just go straight up the gut this time. What do you think?
[39:12.560 --> 39:14.380]  Well, the house has other plans.
[39:15.480 --> 39:15.900]  What do I mean?
[39:15.960 --> 39:17.280]  You're immediately turning left or right.
[39:18.620 --> 39:19.420]  Gain steps?
[39:20.200 --> 39:20.760]  Or money?
[39:21.260 --> 39:21.580]  Steps.
[39:21.600 --> 39:23.080]  You could try and flush yourself down the toilet.
[39:25.840 --> 39:26.280]  Shortcut.
[39:28.280 --> 39:29.400]  There she is.
[39:29.500 --> 39:30.300]  I assume that's my mom?
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.900]  That's a big assumption to make.
[39:34.400 --> 39:34.640]  I don't know.
[39:36.860 --> 39:37.380]  Is it?
[39:37.940 --> 39:38.680]  It's a family house.
[39:38.680 --> 39:40.220]  You walk into a family estate.
[39:40.760 --> 39:41.780]  You grab a photo of...
[39:41.780 --> 39:43.020]  He said his mom was his favorite.
[39:43.320 --> 39:44.040]  That's my mom.
[39:44.660 --> 39:45.640]  He said the mom was his favorite.
[39:48.060 --> 39:48.780]  Let's do this.
[39:48.940 --> 39:49.380]  The parlor game.
[39:49.620 --> 39:50.220]  The parlor.
[39:51.880 --> 39:53.140]  This box is the white box.
[39:53.560 --> 39:54.820]  This box is the black box.
[39:55.260 --> 39:57.220]  This, the blue box, contains the gems.
[39:58.600 --> 40:00.920]  Well, is this the same thing there will always be?
[40:01.060 --> 40:01.820]  Yep, same thing.
[40:02.040 --> 40:02.860]  You don't have to read it every day.
[40:02.860 --> 40:03.160]  Okay.
[40:06.140 --> 40:07.180]  So condescending.
[40:08.160 --> 40:09.440]  We're on day two!
[40:10.540 --> 40:12.080]  Was that apples behind you?
[40:12.320 --> 40:12.540]  That tone.
[40:13.900 --> 40:15.120]  Was it apples behind me?
[40:16.780 --> 40:17.300]  No.
[40:18.140 --> 40:18.820]  It was a purse though.
[40:21.640 --> 40:24.400]  That was a great fucking eye there.
[40:25.120 --> 40:25.660]  It was.
[40:25.900 --> 40:28.540]  It's a starkly different color from the rest of everything else here.
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.900]  Blue box contains the gems.
[40:31.720 --> 40:33.420]  This box is the black box.
[40:39.960 --> 40:41.460]  Why aren't you getting closer?
[40:42.200 --> 40:42.460]  Why?
[40:44.520 --> 40:45.160]  What do you mean?
[40:45.200 --> 40:46.000]  I can read them.
[40:46.120 --> 40:46.900]  What are you talking about?
[40:46.900 --> 40:47.580]  Okay, fair enough.
[40:47.760 --> 40:48.280]  Fair enough.
[40:49.500 --> 40:50.480]  I don't remember the rules.
[40:50.700 --> 40:51.700]  Only one of them lies?
[40:52.840 --> 40:53.660]  At least one is a lie.
[40:53.760 --> 40:54.480]  At least one is the truth.
[40:56.340 --> 40:58.060]  The instructions are right behind you if you need them.
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.920]  Yeah, I was told in a condescending manner that it's the same every day.
[41:02.000 --> 41:02.580]  And I didn't remember.
[41:03.720 --> 41:05.440]  One box displays only true statements.
[41:05.520 --> 41:07.240]  There will always be at least one box that displays only...
[41:07.240 --> 41:08.200]  Oh, at least one.
[41:09.840 --> 41:11.260]  So there could be two that are lying.
[41:12.140 --> 41:12.580]  Could be.
[41:14.720 --> 41:15.080]  Okay.
[41:21.780 --> 41:22.140]  Nice!
[41:23.200 --> 41:23.760]  Two for two.
[41:24.560 --> 41:26.240]  Two gems is a nice amount of gems.
[41:26.240 --> 41:27.260]  Kicking this game's ass.
[41:27.380 --> 41:27.560]  Hell yeah.
[41:27.880 --> 41:28.900]  Ooh, and a corridor.
[41:29.440 --> 41:31.520]  Now you can go straight down like you wanted if you want.
[41:31.520 --> 41:32.720]  Yeah, right up the gut.
[41:32.720 --> 41:33.000]  Let's do it.
[41:33.160 --> 41:33.860]  Right up the gut.
[41:36.080 --> 41:37.200]  Move the chains.
[41:37.460 --> 41:38.440]  Move the chains.
[41:39.080 --> 41:40.060]  Ooh, nice hat.
[41:43.320 --> 41:44.280]  Well, spare room, right?
[41:45.860 --> 41:46.580]  Go straight up the gut.
[41:46.660 --> 41:47.280]  That's up to you.
[41:47.740 --> 41:48.980]  Or you could get a key.
[41:49.760 --> 41:50.880]  Or a breaker box.
[41:51.940 --> 41:52.980]  What's the breaker box?
[41:53.460 --> 41:54.340]  Oh, I can just turn it on?
[41:54.440 --> 41:54.700]  You don't know yet.
[41:54.860 --> 41:55.080]  Okay.
[41:57.200 --> 41:58.620]  Well, let's get a key.
[41:58.740 --> 41:59.620]  Draft it if you want to find out.
[42:00.560 --> 42:01.100]  Too late.
[42:03.420 --> 42:04.540]  You know a key is valuable.
[42:04.800 --> 42:05.340]  Yeah, I do know that.
[42:05.500 --> 42:06.060]  You're going to need those.
[42:06.760 --> 42:07.140]  What's this?
[42:08.860 --> 42:09.420]  Oh, okay.
[42:10.400 --> 42:11.740]  Hey, you might want to write this down, idiot.
[42:12.260 --> 42:17.180]  Oh, the kitchen takes me that way.
[42:21.140 --> 42:22.640]  One day you might be able to buy a banana.
[42:25.060 --> 42:25.600]  One day.
[42:25.780 --> 42:27.000]  But today is not that day.
[42:27.000 --> 42:27.600]  What?
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.080]  Oh, boy.
[42:32.540 --> 42:33.180]  I guess.
[42:36.220 --> 42:36.920]  Yeah, why not?
[42:38.980 --> 42:42.040]  So the telescope, yeah, it automatically positions every time.
[42:42.160 --> 42:43.400]  So you don't need to like move it around.
[42:43.860 --> 42:46.580]  Yeah, but what if you just kind of start whipping it around?
[42:47.440 --> 42:48.620]  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[42:48.700 --> 42:49.000]  Don't, don't.
[42:50.060 --> 42:50.780]  The twins.
[42:51.140 --> 42:52.520]  A pair of chess has been added to the entrance hall.
[42:53.260 --> 42:53.500]  Oh.
[42:55.860 --> 42:57.060]  I remember that one.
[42:58.700 --> 43:00.740]  I hear you angrily banging on your desk.
[43:01.080 --> 43:02.720]  The sound of like eggshells on the desk.
[43:02.740 --> 43:03.100]  I heard it.
[43:03.520 --> 43:04.640]  I didn't say a word.
[43:04.900 --> 43:05.400]  Yeah, I know.
[43:05.800 --> 43:08.120]  Your movement did all the talking.
[43:09.280 --> 43:10.160]  Yes, it did.
[43:12.240 --> 43:13.340]  I remember the bad one.
[43:13.920 --> 43:15.640]  Anyway, should we go back to the main hall?
[43:16.780 --> 43:17.540]  It's up to you.
[43:19.100 --> 43:21.760]  I don't remember whose idea this was.
[43:21.840 --> 43:23.320]  I think it was Geoff's idea to do this.
[43:23.940 --> 43:25.040]  Geoff, this is a great idea.
[43:25.220 --> 43:26.040]  Thank you very much.
[43:26.160 --> 43:26.940]  Yeah, I'm having a good time.
[43:28.640 --> 43:29.960]  That sounded sarcastic, I am.
[43:33.040 --> 43:34.380]  Ooh, double dice.
[43:35.640 --> 43:36.700]  And coins soon.
[43:36.900 --> 43:38.320]  And half a club sandwich.
[43:38.980 --> 43:39.480]  Hell yeah.
[43:39.760 --> 43:41.020]  That's a banana right there.
[43:41.180 --> 43:41.980]  Oh, you got bananas.
[43:42.460 --> 43:42.700]  Yeah!
[43:47.920 --> 43:49.820]  I'm going to laugh so fucking hard when this door is locked.
[43:49.880 --> 43:51.300]  Yeah, I just thought about that.
[43:52.320 --> 43:53.300]  So should I buy bananas?
[43:53.320 --> 43:54.080]  Or just wait?
[43:55.240 --> 43:57.460]  You can see what the chef salad does, maybe.
[43:57.620 --> 43:58.240]  Because it's five.
[43:58.580 --> 43:59.520]  Every green room.
[44:00.260 --> 44:00.460]  None.
[44:04.840 --> 44:05.540]  That's your choice.
[44:05.640 --> 44:06.580]  Do you want to buy bananas now?
[44:06.660 --> 44:07.080]  Do you want to wait?
[44:07.200 --> 44:08.620]  Do you want to save for maybe something else?
[44:09.320 --> 44:09.720]  I'll wait it out.
[44:11.180 --> 44:12.760]  I'll wait it out for this locked door.
[44:12.780 --> 44:15.220]  I mean, you used like two bananas running back and forth.
[44:18.940 --> 44:20.800]  I hear a lot of judgment on day two.
[44:21.940 --> 44:22.200]  Nah.
[44:23.580 --> 44:25.720]  It's like a 10% increase from day one.
[44:28.440 --> 44:29.920]  Okay, I can deal with that.
[44:39.230 --> 44:40.590]  Hang on, hang on.
[44:40.750 --> 44:42.290]  There's a big old safe right there.
[44:45.170 --> 44:46.010]  Christmas tree.
[44:47.610 --> 44:48.390]  Christmas tree.
[44:48.990 --> 44:50.670]  How many presents are there?
[44:50.970 --> 44:55.070]  Yeah, I just started counting things and going like, this has to be, there's nothing to do.
[44:55.290 --> 44:55.790]  Okay, that's fine.
[44:55.870 --> 44:56.510]  Eight unopened.
[44:59.450 --> 45:00.330]  Just making sure.
[45:04.440 --> 45:05.520]  Something about you.
[45:05.640 --> 45:06.240]  Ooh, safe.
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.500]  There's so many times where like Nick does something and I don't want to spoil it, but inside I'm just dying laughing.
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.980]  When you stopped right at the end and I'd say, oh, if he doesn't see it.
[45:23.480 --> 45:25.660]  Geoff and Gavin, have you two figured out this safe yet?
[45:25.820 --> 45:26.060]  Yes.
[45:27.780 --> 45:28.580]  Try 1225.
[45:29.560 --> 45:30.700]  Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[45:31.840 --> 45:32.660]  Let's do it.
[45:35.790 --> 45:37.230]  That was fucking wild, Eric.
[45:37.270 --> 45:37.530]  Wow.
[45:37.850 --> 45:39.750]  It's Christmas. The whole thing is Christmas.
[45:40.110 --> 45:42.890]  Yeah, I just didn't think to try it for ages.
[45:43.330 --> 45:43.610]  For ages.
[45:43.610 --> 45:45.770]  I mean, it doesn't seem like there's a penalty.
[45:46.710 --> 45:47.270]  There's no.
[45:47.950 --> 45:48.190]  Okay.
[45:49.070 --> 45:50.610]  The royal court will want this embarrassment.
[45:53.130 --> 45:55.770]  Maybe this is Eric's favorite game.
[45:58.310 --> 46:01.550]  Truly watching Nick play this, I never want to see this game again in my life.
[46:02.270 --> 46:04.550]  I probably had 20 days before I opened that safe.
[46:04.550 --> 46:06.310]  Oh yeah, it took a while for me.
[46:07.150 --> 46:10.050]  I didn't find it for probably like day 17 or something.
[46:10.210 --> 46:13.030]  Oh, I found it day one and then I was just really annoyed for 20 days.
[46:14.970 --> 46:15.330]  Okay.
[46:17.450 --> 46:19.690]  Well, that's how I felt when I finally figured out.
[46:19.730 --> 46:20.850]  I got a gem. I got a gem.
[46:21.530 --> 46:23.610]  Without spoiling anything, when I finally figured out the garage.
[46:23.850 --> 46:24.850]  It took me way too long.
[46:28.090 --> 46:29.530]  Well, time to go on back, Nick.
[46:30.510 --> 46:32.790]  Yeah, you can go left from the entrance hall or right.
[46:39.760 --> 46:40.400]  And I...
[46:40.400 --> 46:42.420]  Oh, I could do this and then go to the other hall.
[46:44.040 --> 46:45.060]  Get some steps back.
[46:46.940 --> 46:48.420]  Yeah, I think this is a good idea.
[46:49.040 --> 46:49.400]  Thank you.
[46:51.180 --> 46:52.860]  Quick note, thank you for beginning at a thrilling time.
[46:52.920 --> 46:54.900]  The whole Lord Evanson is peculiar personality.
[46:55.180 --> 46:56.200]  Someone made up for your own absence.
[46:56.480 --> 46:57.920]  I get to appreciate the game in the billiard room.
[47:00.560 --> 47:00.880]  Ah.
[47:05.740 --> 47:08.900]  The billiard room is, I think, the dumbest I've felt in this game.
[47:08.980 --> 47:09.780]  Oh, is it a puzzle room?
[47:10.240 --> 47:13.100]  Oh, I get way more tangled up in the parlor than the billiard room.
[47:13.260 --> 47:17.280]  Yeah, once you figure out the billiard room, then it's just...
[47:17.280 --> 47:17.740]  Well...
[47:17.740 --> 47:18.460]  It doesn't really matter.
[47:19.300 --> 47:21.900]  Yeah, once I figured out, like, the order to...
[47:21.900 --> 47:23.420]  Yeah, the order.
[47:23.440 --> 47:24.360]  Do certain added mechanics.
[47:24.620 --> 47:26.560]  That's the hard part for me, too, is the order.
[47:27.420 --> 47:31.180]  The first time I went into the billiard room, I brute-forced the puzzle by just...
[47:31.180 --> 47:31.940]  Oh, no.
[47:32.200 --> 47:33.260]  Wait, the very first time?
[47:33.700 --> 47:35.120]  The very first time.
[47:36.360 --> 47:37.160]  Just, like, write it down?
[47:37.160 --> 47:38.120]  Oh, really? Interesting.
[47:38.120 --> 47:39.200]  Not even write it...
[47:39.200 --> 47:40.300]  Yeah, just...
[47:40.680 --> 47:42.220]  Click, click, click, click, click.
[47:42.360 --> 47:42.580]  Okay.
[47:42.880 --> 47:43.940]  Click, click, click, click.
[47:45.140 --> 47:46.740]  And then realizing what it was.
[47:47.400 --> 47:48.360]  Yeah, it cost me a gem.
[47:49.120 --> 47:51.540]  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
[47:51.540 --> 47:54.100]  You can redraw, or there's two items in the closet.
[47:54.420 --> 47:55.380]  Yeah, let's do that.
[47:55.440 --> 47:58.560]  Because there's gonna be another way to go, but I just don't know if it's gonna dead-end you that way.
[47:58.600 --> 48:00.360]  Yeah, but it might give me a key if I go to the closet.
[48:01.940 --> 48:02.500]  Let's do it.
[48:05.720 --> 48:06.600]  It didn't give me a key.
[48:07.240 --> 48:07.800]  No, it's okay.
[48:08.300 --> 48:09.260]  Can I smash a door with this?
[48:09.260 --> 48:10.200]  Hammer is useful.
[48:11.440 --> 48:13.640]  Can shatter padlocks and lock trunks.
[48:14.060 --> 48:14.920]  Alright, back to the main hall.
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.100]  Yeah, go back to the main hall.
[48:17.860 --> 48:18.220]  Yaaah!
[48:19.080 --> 48:20.640]  The hammer might be useful.
[48:22.560 --> 48:24.400]  Well, it took him a long time to grab the shovel.
[48:24.600 --> 48:25.220]  I felt like...
[48:26.640 --> 48:27.220]  Hey, key.
[48:27.720 --> 48:28.520]  Okay, so...
[48:28.520 --> 48:28.840]  There you go.
[48:29.100 --> 48:29.800]  And again.
[48:30.260 --> 48:32.260]  If we want to take the risk of going back to the boudoir...
[48:35.400 --> 48:36.840]  Or just continue through the hallway.
[48:36.960 --> 48:37.840]  Probably the boudoir, right?
[48:40.140 --> 48:41.460]  How many steps do you have? 34?
[48:42.100 --> 48:42.880]  34, yeah.
[48:44.520 --> 48:47.420]  I mean, no matter what, I'm going to have to go through the same amount of doors.
[48:50.260 --> 48:53.480]  You just wouldn't struggle as much with locked doors down here.
[48:54.220 --> 48:54.340]  Yeah.
[48:55.240 --> 48:56.140]  Well, that's a hint.
[48:56.680 --> 48:57.760]  He already read that hint.
[48:58.040 --> 48:58.660]  Oh, he did?
[48:58.840 --> 48:59.040]  Yeah.
[48:59.360 --> 49:02.100]  You get more locked doors the further up you go.
[49:02.300 --> 49:04.160]  It was on the woolen security.
[49:05.620 --> 49:06.260]  Well, let's...
[49:06.260 --> 49:10.520]  I wonder if you want to go hallway and then see if you want to expand that out.
[49:10.760 --> 49:13.000]  You have 34 steps.
[49:13.080 --> 49:14.500]  It still feels early on this run.
[49:14.700 --> 49:15.420]  So maybe you want to keep going.
[49:15.640 --> 49:17.620]  You want to maybe check out that thing to the right also.
[49:19.360 --> 49:21.140]  Hold on, I can't go back for some reason.
[49:22.720 --> 49:23.820]  Oh, okay.
[49:23.900 --> 49:26.760]  I have to do this first and then I can do it.
[49:26.920 --> 49:27.600]  So we'll do pantry.
[49:30.600 --> 49:31.560]  Getting them coins.
[49:31.740 --> 49:33.100]  The doors on the left wing are more likely to be locked.
[49:33.100 --> 49:33.300]  Excellent.
[49:35.200 --> 49:36.280]  We're in the west wing.
[49:42.700 --> 49:43.720]  Bit of interest.
[49:43.980 --> 49:44.460]  Lovely stuff.
[49:48.100 --> 49:49.340]  Loaded with coins.
[49:53.580 --> 49:54.100]  Apple.
[49:54.720 --> 49:55.060]  Nice.
[49:55.720 --> 49:56.360]  There you go.
[49:56.480 --> 49:56.720]  Thank you.
[49:56.860 --> 49:58.320]  I have a feeling this door is going to be locked.
[49:58.420 --> 49:59.080]  No, not yet.
[50:03.220 --> 50:03.740]  So...
[50:03.740 --> 50:04.560]  Plus gem.
[50:05.940 --> 50:07.020]  I think we should...
[50:07.500 --> 50:08.840]  I would think that's probably...
[50:08.840 --> 50:10.540]  Compared to spare room, I would think that's probably it.
[50:11.640 --> 50:11.960]  But...
[50:11.960 --> 50:13.640]  Oh, yeah, because we don't know how to get through security yet.
[50:13.640 --> 50:14.240]  No, no.
[50:14.660 --> 50:15.780]  I had the same thought.
[50:15.860 --> 50:17.060]  I was like, well, surely we can...
[50:17.060 --> 50:17.180]  Oh.
[50:18.580 --> 50:18.900]  Cool.
[50:19.840 --> 50:20.080]  Ooh.
[50:20.820 --> 50:22.160]  That is a big-ass clock.
[50:26.400 --> 50:26.720]  Okay.
[50:27.220 --> 50:27.740]  All right.
[50:27.840 --> 50:29.040]  Quite a few clocks in this run.
[50:29.060 --> 50:29.880]  Loads of clocks.
[50:31.880 --> 50:34.220]  Looks like the spare room is going to be the way to go here.
[50:35.440 --> 50:38.460]  Yeah, I want to know what the breaker box does eventually, but...
[50:38.460 --> 50:39.740]  Yeah, but I don't want to dead-end us on it.
[50:39.800 --> 50:40.940]  No, I wouldn't dead-end it here either.
[50:45.600 --> 50:46.580]  Let me have the tape.
[50:49.500 --> 50:49.860]  Okay.
[50:50.620 --> 50:51.680]  The billiard room.
[50:52.720 --> 50:54.200]  That's the one where Andrew feels dumb.
[50:54.380 --> 50:55.080]  That's cool.
[51:02.220 --> 51:04.780]  But this one also lets us go straight up.
[51:08.380 --> 51:08.920]  Straight up.
[51:09.020 --> 51:09.700]  It's your game, man.
[51:09.780 --> 51:11.760]  You pick what makes the most sense to you.
[51:12.000 --> 51:12.300]  Okay.
[51:14.080 --> 51:14.920]  Maybe there's food.
[51:18.730 --> 51:19.550]  Like me in real life.
[51:23.770 --> 51:24.490]  Key time.
[51:24.710 --> 51:25.070]  Key time.
[51:25.770 --> 51:26.590]  Ooh, the courtyard.
[51:28.190 --> 51:29.110]  What's the courtyard?
[51:31.890 --> 51:32.970]  You guys said...
[51:32.970 --> 51:34.550]  Geoff, you said you hadn't used it really, right?
[51:34.570 --> 51:35.170]  Open your map.
[51:35.290 --> 51:36.030]  No, it was...
[51:36.030 --> 51:37.650]  Greenhouse is the one I said I hadn't used.
[51:37.850 --> 51:39.270]  I go to the courtyard all the time.
[51:39.270 --> 51:39.830]  Okay.
[51:40.550 --> 51:41.290]  It's got three doors.
[51:41.970 --> 51:43.030]  I do like that.
[51:43.490 --> 51:44.650]  And the West Wing Hall...
[51:45.250 --> 51:48.250]  West Wing, they said, is more likely to be locked, so those doors will probably be locked.
[51:50.090 --> 51:50.670]  So, yeah.
[51:50.910 --> 51:52.510]  I'm gonna do the courtyard.
[51:53.850 --> 51:54.550]  Burn a gem.
[51:57.950 --> 51:58.990]  No apple trees, huh?
[52:00.310 --> 52:01.330]  No apple trees.
[52:02.090 --> 52:02.550]  I'm gonna...
[52:02.550 --> 52:03.490]  Can you pick up that shovel?
[52:04.930 --> 52:05.730]  I didn't even...
[52:05.730 --> 52:06.390]  Oh, fuck me.
[52:06.470 --> 52:07.170]  I didn't even see it.
[52:07.590 --> 52:08.930]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[52:08.930 --> 52:10.010]  I did not see it.
[52:10.010 --> 52:13.030]  It's so hard not to say stuff, because you wanted to find it naturally, but...
[52:13.030 --> 52:15.610]  We'll, like, drive to your house, and me and your kid are gonna beat you up.
[52:16.030 --> 52:17.590]  Like, we're just gonna do it.
[52:17.670 --> 52:18.950]  We're just gonna beat you up.
[52:19.010 --> 52:20.810]  You both would get your asses beat anyway.
[52:23.290 --> 52:25.870]  Nick, why did you say earlier that you were never gonna play this game again?
[52:26.750 --> 52:28.130]  I feel like...
[52:28.130 --> 52:29.390]  Never looking at this thing.
[52:29.470 --> 52:31.030]  I never want to see this game again in my life.
[52:31.130 --> 52:33.030]  I feel like the fun was a little bit...
[52:35.010 --> 52:35.630]  Burned a brick.
[52:35.770 --> 52:36.990]  You have to play this game.
[52:37.110 --> 52:38.250]  I don't want to.
[52:38.510 --> 52:39.350]  This is an escape room.
[52:40.330 --> 52:42.190]  Yeah, but that's...
[52:42.190 --> 52:43.250]  This is a low bar, bud.
[52:43.630 --> 52:44.570]  This is a low bar, Gavin.
[52:44.890 --> 52:45.070]  You're good.
[52:45.530 --> 52:46.450]  You're decent.
[52:46.910 --> 52:49.350]  And don't forget you have three redraws, too.
[52:49.630 --> 52:50.250]  Oh, whoops.
[52:52.270 --> 52:52.670]  NBD?
[52:55.930 --> 52:57.190]  As long as it's unlocked.
[52:59.730 --> 53:07.040]  I can redraw here.
[53:09.560 --> 53:10.600]  A gymnasium.
[53:11.860 --> 53:15.080]  You cannot see the floor plans while drafting in this room.
[53:15.460 --> 53:15.980]  Interesting.
[53:19.340 --> 53:19.700]  Uh...
[53:20.080 --> 53:21.420]  Have you guys ever used a dark room?
[53:22.420 --> 53:22.580]  Yeah.
[53:22.840 --> 53:23.420]  All the time.
[53:23.760 --> 53:23.880]  Of course.
[53:25.880 --> 53:29.620]  I'll tell you, out of all of these rooms, the one I don't like is the gymnasium.
[53:29.760 --> 53:29.980]  Okay.
[53:30.560 --> 53:32.400]  Lose two steps every time is nuts.
[53:32.680 --> 53:33.520]  Yeah, that's pretty bad.
[53:33.580 --> 53:35.360]  I'm gonna see what the other options are for these other doors.
[53:36.860 --> 53:37.220]  Interesting.
[53:41.470 --> 53:42.190]  Okay, well...
[53:42.970 --> 53:43.330]  Answered.
[53:44.150 --> 53:45.290]  Do I want to check that one?
[53:46.430 --> 53:47.250]  Why wouldn't you?
[53:48.790 --> 53:52.370]  You can set something, you don't have to go in, it doesn't cost a step to draw a room.
[53:53.970 --> 53:55.250]  I mean, I was thinking about it.
[53:55.890 --> 53:56.650]  Ten percent judgment.
[53:56.970 --> 53:59.370]  It's like whenever you're like, oh, I was thinking about doing this thing.
[53:59.510 --> 54:00.370]  Oh, why wouldn't you?
[54:01.890 --> 54:02.970]  I was thinking about it.
[54:03.050 --> 54:04.550]  Like I said, I'm thinking about it.
[54:04.610 --> 54:06.290]  I'm talking out loud.
[54:07.110 --> 54:08.450]  So allow me to think.
[54:09.830 --> 54:11.350]  So, yeah, you have no idea what these are.
[54:11.530 --> 54:12.250]  Oh, wow, you have...
[54:12.250 --> 54:13.430]  Oh, when it says...
[54:13.430 --> 54:15.210]  Oh, that means, like, full on.
[54:15.510 --> 54:15.930]  Oh, heartbreaker.
[54:15.930 --> 54:16.510]  Heartbreaker.
[54:16.650 --> 54:17.710]  Oh, that's not good.
[54:17.830 --> 54:20.090]  All right, well, lefty loosey.
[54:20.570 --> 54:21.590]  Oh, it's unlocked.
[54:24.290 --> 54:25.130]  Oh, wow.
[54:25.350 --> 54:26.390]  All right.
[54:26.630 --> 54:27.870]  So we got two options here.
[54:29.750 --> 54:29.970]  Yep.
[54:30.070 --> 54:31.650]  Or you can redraw a view.
[54:31.870 --> 54:33.190]  You have a bad gut feeling.
[54:34.230 --> 54:34.750]  I don't.
[54:37.670 --> 54:39.070]  Oh, the church.
[54:40.090 --> 54:40.450]  Wow.
[54:40.750 --> 54:41.710]  Have a look at your map.
[54:44.730 --> 54:45.270]  There you go.
[54:45.270 --> 54:45.970]  Okay.
[54:47.650 --> 54:50.650]  You just lose one coin every time you come in here, but maybe okay.
[54:51.070 --> 54:51.270]  Locked?
[54:51.430 --> 54:51.710]  Yeah.
[54:54.070 --> 54:58.110]  Well, see if you can find yourself some keys.
[54:58.810 --> 54:59.950]  These have anything to do?
[55:00.210 --> 55:01.170]  What's the...
[55:01.170 --> 55:01.610]  There's numbers.
[55:01.930 --> 55:02.210]  There's, like, a big...
[55:02.210 --> 55:03.310]  There's, like, a chess piece there.
[55:03.710 --> 55:04.290]  Look left.
[55:05.250 --> 55:05.770]  Where are you looking?
[55:06.730 --> 55:07.030]  Look right.
[55:07.030 --> 55:07.270]  Oh, there.
[55:08.650 --> 55:09.610]  Yeah, I saw that earlier.
[55:09.670 --> 55:10.130]  It didn't do anything.
[55:10.230 --> 55:10.470]  Nice little bishop.
[55:10.670 --> 55:11.310]  Nice bish.
[55:13.450 --> 55:17.270]  Does the bishop have anything to do with Christianity?
[55:21.410 --> 55:22.450]  The answer is yes.
[55:29.140 --> 55:31.440]  I never want to see this game again in my life.
[55:31.560 --> 55:31.760]  Why not?
[55:31.800 --> 55:32.900]  I never want to look at it.
[55:33.000 --> 55:33.840]  I don't want to see it.
[55:33.940 --> 55:34.220]  You know what?
[55:34.280 --> 55:34.980]  I don't want to think about it.
[55:35.000 --> 55:35.900]  I think I want to keep playing.
[55:36.740 --> 55:39.900]  Well, we're going to do a full playthrough here, so you got at least 40 hours.
[55:40.300 --> 55:41.060]  Look at the stained glass.
[55:41.340 --> 55:43.900]  I don't know if there's anything connected here, but look at the stained glass.
[55:43.900 --> 55:44.900]  Some of these are...
[55:45.880 --> 55:46.740]  There's like...
[55:47.580 --> 55:47.940]  maid?
[55:48.140 --> 55:48.520]  What is that?
[55:48.640 --> 55:49.800]  Chef with something?
[55:50.280 --> 55:50.400]  Like...
[55:50.400 --> 55:51.260]  Maid, chef, farmer.
[55:51.260 --> 55:53.840]  The bishop being in here feels significant in some way.
[55:54.240 --> 55:57.100]  Now, when you were doing your initial runs, Geoff and Gavin...
[55:57.100 --> 55:57.340]  Yes.
[55:57.580 --> 56:01.620]  Were you trying to get to the end, or were you just, like, looking at rooms?
[56:02.080 --> 56:07.140]  I was trying to get to the end for the first, like, three days, and then I spent probably ten days just looking at rooms.
[56:07.140 --> 56:14.440]  I figured if I could go to every room in the game, then I would easily be able to beat it, you know?
[56:14.580 --> 56:16.540]  You kind of think that linearly early on.
[56:16.800 --> 56:20.360]  Yeah, I wasn't really focused on trying to get to the end for a while.
[56:21.800 --> 56:25.060]  My immediate focus was just drawing rooms that I hadn't drawn yet.
[56:25.240 --> 56:28.780]  Exactly, yeah. Any time I encountered a new room, that's what I would pick.
[56:29.020 --> 56:32.800]  And then I hit a roadblock where I felt like I wasn't getting any new rooms, you know?
[56:32.840 --> 56:36.320]  And I just, like, I couldn't get any new rooms, and then I realized maybe I had to do some other stuff.
[56:36.320 --> 56:40.680]  Oh, is that door locked? You try that. Oh, there you go.
[56:41.680 --> 56:43.720]  Oh, billiard room. Billiard room.
[56:44.560 --> 56:47.200]  Is that bad? Less likely to find items laying around?
[56:47.200 --> 56:48.140]  Yes, that's bad.
[56:48.720 --> 56:50.640]  Yeah, I think you want as many items as you can get.
[56:50.640 --> 56:53.880]  Yeah, I'm just making sure that it's, like, the item... yeah, okay.
[56:55.720 --> 56:58.820]  When you solve that other puzzle, you get two gems.
[57:02.600 --> 57:05.900]  Well, let's get a load of this shit show.
[57:07.680 --> 57:08.080]  No.
[57:10.160 --> 57:10.560]  No.
[57:16.350 --> 57:17.150]  I see.
[57:18.350 --> 57:18.710]  Okay.
[57:21.550 --> 57:22.350]  Immediately leaves.
[57:22.650 --> 57:24.210]  I'm looking around.
[57:24.670 --> 57:25.470]  No, no, I know it.
[57:25.570 --> 57:25.950]  He's exploring.
[57:27.710 --> 57:29.870]  He's seeing what they got on the bar.
[57:30.010 --> 57:30.190]  Yeah.
[57:30.390 --> 57:31.830]  He's looking for his Bailey's on ice.
[57:32.010 --> 57:34.370]  Yeah, that could be instructions or something.
[57:35.090 --> 57:38.190]  Yeah, beer could give you, like, a plus one dartboard skill.
[57:38.790 --> 57:39.390]  That's true.
[57:39.390 --> 57:41.210]  Wouldn't want to waste the dartboard first.
[57:41.490 --> 57:41.930]  Tends to.
[57:43.290 --> 57:45.030]  Making sure all the pool balls are there.
[57:45.250 --> 57:46.850]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:48.090 --> 57:50.370]  What if Regulation did a video where we just play pool?
[57:51.130 --> 57:52.090]  Ooh, that would be great.
[57:52.270 --> 57:53.170]  I love pool.
[57:56.710 --> 57:57.430]  Okay, well...
[57:57.430 --> 58:00.730]  Maybe if we ever get an office someday, we'll get, like, a pool table.
[58:02.190 --> 58:03.110]  That seems crazy.
[58:04.030 --> 58:05.930]  That seems like a high list of priorities, right?
[58:06.270 --> 58:07.730]  I'm sure we can get one on Facebook Marketplace.
[58:07.730 --> 58:09.590]  Okay, I don't really...
[58:09.590 --> 58:16.870]  So, the first time I encountered this puzzle, I solved it by going 20, then 5, then 12, then 9, then 14, then 11.
[58:17.070 --> 58:18.730]  Wait, you pressed 20 first and went...
[58:19.490 --> 58:21.490]  Why didn't you press 1?
[58:28.160 --> 58:29.420]  And then 3.
[58:30.020 --> 58:30.900]  What about 2?
[58:32.860 --> 58:33.820]  Okay, so...
[58:33.820 --> 58:34.700]  That doesn't say anything.
[58:38.290 --> 58:38.990]  Try it.
[58:39.110 --> 58:39.690]  Try my hit.
[58:39.830 --> 58:40.910]  There's 1. Try 2.
[58:42.090 --> 58:42.570]  Okay.
[58:44.130 --> 58:44.570]  1.
[58:44.730 --> 58:48.930]  So, I hit 1, and then it went next here, and then I hit all the buttons again until something else happened.
[58:49.750 --> 58:55.670]  I just did not attempt to solve it until the second turn, and I felt very stupid when I realized what it was asking.
[58:55.850 --> 58:56.410]  Hit 1 again.
[59:01.780 --> 59:02.220]  I...
[59:03.720 --> 59:04.440]  Hit 4.
[59:09.510 --> 59:09.950]  Hit...
[59:09.950 --> 59:10.570]  What's that?
[59:10.650 --> 59:11.330]  That's triple.
[59:12.710 --> 59:13.590]  So, that's...
[59:13.590 --> 59:14.630]  4, 8, 12...
[59:16.570 --> 59:17.450]  Plus 18...
[59:17.450 --> 59:18.690]  Was that 40?
[59:20.250 --> 59:21.190]  Yeah, hit 40.
[59:21.630 --> 59:22.750]  Hit... No, no, no. Go to...
[59:22.750 --> 59:24.170]  Go to 20.
[59:25.410 --> 59:26.610]  Can you go up and down?
[59:27.130 --> 59:27.250]  No.
[59:27.970 --> 59:28.590]  Uh, no.
[59:29.610 --> 59:30.790]  So, it's just...
[59:30.790 --> 59:31.550]  It's just the outer circle.
[59:31.550 --> 59:31.930]  So, hit 1.
[59:32.150 --> 59:32.990]  Hit 4.
[59:33.250 --> 59:34.490]  Because that's 1, 3.
[59:35.230 --> 59:36.170]  That is triple.
[59:36.290 --> 59:37.250]  Triple's on the inside, right?
[59:37.270 --> 59:38.270]  Because double's on the outside.
[59:38.570 --> 59:39.170]  I think so.
[59:39.830 --> 59:40.510]  But 4...
[59:40.510 --> 59:42.270]  Maybe it's just 18 and 4?
[59:43.730 --> 59:44.670]  No, because that's 22.
[59:44.850 --> 59:45.570]  So, what's that?
[59:46.770 --> 59:48.950]  Maybe it's just the next thing, Eric.
[59:49.790 --> 59:50.410]  What is that?
[59:50.550 --> 59:50.910]  What do you mean?
[59:52.150 --> 59:52.470]  Like...
[59:52.470 --> 59:53.870]  Would it just be...
[59:53.870 --> 59:54.130]  12?
[59:55.470 --> 59:56.750]  Like, it doesn't count the first one?
[59:56.770 --> 59:57.350]  It's not adding?
[59:57.490 --> 59:58.530]  It's the next thing up?
[01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:00.810]  It's triple 4, right?
[01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:01.690]  I'm not following, I'm sorry.
[01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:04.050]  Well, it's triple for 4.
[01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.990]  Okay.
[01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:06.450]  So, it'd be 4, 8, 12.
[01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:07.630]  If I'm just not adding...
[01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.610]  Ah, fuck it.
[01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:09.950]  I don't know.
[01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.690]  I have no idea.
[01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.310]  Well, just try something.
[01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.990]  Like, I don't...
[01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.970]  Like, it seems like you're...
[01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:15.450]  It seems like you're pointing at something.
[01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:16.430]  I just don't know what you're pointing at.
[01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:17.390]  I just...
[01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:18.590]  I don't follow what you're saying.
[01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:19.510]  I was just wrong.
[01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:20.050]  I was just wrong.
[01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.470]  That's all.
[01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.750]  That's all.
[01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.170]  Because one...
[01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.050]  Because it's showing...
[01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:25.750]  When you do this puzzle from the start, it's 1.
[01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:26.490]  So, you hit 1.
[01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:28.990]  And then it's 1 and 3 on their singles.
[01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.470]  Yeah.
[01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.690]  Which would be 4.
[01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:33.830]  So, this would be 18 and 12, which is 30.
[01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:34.550]  Like you said.
[01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:36.050]  Maybe it's...
[01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.310]  Do you think there could be subtraction here?
[01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:40.990]  I hadn't thought about that.
[01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.090]  Try 12.
[01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.730]  No.
[01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:46.110]  Nope.
[01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.470]  Do you think it's the difference?
[01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:51.950]  Do you think it's 14?
[01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:53.510]  Like, is the difference between...
[01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:54.330]  No, did we just try that?
[01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.670]  No, we just tried...
[01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:56.370]  You did not try that.
[01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:57.290]  You tried 12 and...
[01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:58.230]  Try 14.
[01:00:58.650 --> 01:00:58.870]  Okay.
[01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:00.610]  Sorry.
[01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.610]  Okay.
[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:03.350]  There we go.
[01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:06.390]  Okay, so we subtract the yellow from that.
[01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.910]  So, 3.
[01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:11.710]  And then...
[01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:12.170]  Goddamn.
[01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:13.450]  Do 20.
[01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.890]  That has to be multiply.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.820]  Oh, fuck me.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.500]  Oh my god.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.840]  Okay, so...
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.500]  What's this?
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.940]  How are we PEMDOS-ing this thing?
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.640]  I was going to say, don't you follow multiplication first?
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.500]  I think it's...
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.040]  Yeah, but in what order?
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.360]  Is it 3 times 10 or 3 times 15?
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.780]  Probably 15 is closer.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.160]  I guess 3 times 10 would be 30.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.220]  No, no, no.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:39.740]  Hang on.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.240]  Hang on.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.400]  3 times 15 is 45.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.180]  Yeah, but then subtracting 10 is going to be too high.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.840]  No, but it would be...
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840]  Wouldn't it be subtracting 30?
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.640]  Oh, you're saying multiply both of them.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:54.440]  No, no, no.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.660]  If it's on the inner one, does it double or are we not applying that rule?
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:01.560]  What?
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:01.840]  The triple?
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.760]  You know, the line that it's on, you were saying earlier, is the triple score for that one?
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.120]  Would that not triple the 10 to 30?
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.940]  We haven't tripled anything.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:11.860]  Remember when it was 18?
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.620]  It was still 18.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:12.960]  Okay.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.040]  18 and 4 was 14, which was the next solution.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.600]  So if we aren't tripling anything, it's just 10, 15, and 3.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.260]  But what order are we doing?
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.080]  3...
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.380]  It almost looks like...
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.480]  Okay, okay.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.440]  What if it's 3 times 15?
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.700]  What if it's 3 times 15?
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.100]  45.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.320]  Okay.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.960]  And then 3 times 10, which is 30.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.240]  And we subtract those, and it would be 15.
[01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.830]  There you go.
[01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:43.450]  Hot damn.
[01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.090]  There's two keys.
[01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:47.230]  Two keys.
[01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.850]  There you go!
[01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:48.870]  Was that worth it?
[01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.670]  Two keys.
[01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:51.930]  Wow, you needed keys, didn't he?
[01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:53.590]  Yeah, to go up to the chapel.
[01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.350]  I thought we had like a hammer.
[01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.350]  Can't we just blast everything?
[01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.590]  Smash through the dartboard?
[01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:02.550]  That's for trunks, please.
[01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:10.970]  What's wild is, much like the gems, every time you do one of those, it gets progressively harder, and they were all manually input by the guy that made the game.
[01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:11.390]  Yeah.
[01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:12.950]  They were all designed by him.
[01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:13.630]  Oh, wow.
[01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.090]  Chance of finding items in green rooms.
[01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:16.290]  No gems, though.
[01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:19.250]  It's not like a random thing.
[01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:21.010]  Well, West Wing Hall it is.
[01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:21.430]  That's nuts.
[01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.750]  So many.
[01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:25.810]  So you eventually will cycle.
[01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:31.250]  Out of respect for the late, West Wing will be closed until further notice.
[01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:41.870]  Oh, that door is blocked, so...
[01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:42.710]  Yeah, because the bathroom.
[01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:42.990]  Right.
[01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:44.110]  A little lavatory.
[01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:46.830]  Don't forget, you can redraw.
[01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:49.390]  Probably for the best.
[01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:55.550]  Workshop, combine inventory to create new items.
[01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:59.190]  Okay.
[01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:01.810]  Sounds cool.
[01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:03.530]  What?
[01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:05.210]  What was that?
[01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:06.050]  That's the dinner bell.
[01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:07.650]  Oh, you're rank eight.
[01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:12.490]  So you could go back and eat that food if you want more steps.
[01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.610]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:14.070]  Ah!
[01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:17.130]  Oh, God.
[01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:20.790]  I never want to see this game again.
[01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:25.990]  It's so funny where, Eric, you have such a great eye for identifying what needs to be done,
[01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.010]  but zero interest.
[01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:27.650]  Zero.
[01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:34.750]  I mean, I think saying zero interest might be an overestimation of how much interest I have.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.240]  It's the...
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.100]  It's like the epitome of being good at a thing you don't like.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:46.780]  Yes.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:52.460]  Eric, if you played this solo and you played to late day five, I bet you'd be sucked in.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.520]  I don't want to get...
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.280]  I don't ever want to...
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.380]  I just don't want to do it.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.180]  I can make a sledgehammer battery pack.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.820]  I want to play Marvel Rivals and that's it.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.620]  I want to play City of the Wolves and that's it.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:03.340]  I want to shoot something.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.220]  I want to fight something.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.100]  That's all I want to do.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:05.960]  Why the fuck is it doing that?
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:06.780]  Hold on.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.000]  I love this room.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.320]  Did green make something happen?
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:10.820]  No.
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.240]  So sometimes I think it may have busted.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.820]  So if you want to back out and then load back in.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.400]  Oh, there you go.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.740]  So you need one more thing.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.400]  Oh!
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:19.280]  I see.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.720]  Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.000]  I've never made anything in this room.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.400]  This seems really important.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.240]  This is the room I try and get the most, I think.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:30.420]  Really?
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.520]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.060]  Never mind.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.440]  A hippie, a hippie, a hippie.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.840]  Look at the stuff above.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.360]  Like, I want to know what any of this stuff is.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:38.940]  If it's...
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:39.960]  Box, chart.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.840]  If it seems significant or anything.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:42.660]  Light.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:43.920]  Uh, ooh.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:44.600]  Thanks, thanks man.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.120]  He's staring directly into it.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:47.880]  Light.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:48.820]  What is this?
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.840]  The true box does not always contain the prize.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:52.740]  Wait a minute.
[01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:57.030]  Okay.
[01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:58.470]  Well, at least you have keys.
[01:05:58.810 --> 01:05:59.390]  I got keys.
[01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:00.010]  One key.
[01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.590]  Can you grab the thing that's in the...
[01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:03.870]  This?
[01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:04.650]  Stump over there?
[01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:07.130]  Uh...
[01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.350]  No.
[01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:07.390]  Yeah.
[01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:08.310]  Okay.
[01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:10.870]  I can't grab the yardstick either.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.260]  Alright, time to have a look.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.480]  Let's have a look.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.900]  Ooh, let's...
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:19.580]  Ooh, ooh.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:20.340]  Pull that map out.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.520]  Seems like you might want to...
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.620]  Want to have a look at that map?
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.380]  Roll those dice.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:24.840]  Wow.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.080]  Uh-huh.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.580]  Opportunity to earn money direction and spread money.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:31.440]  I don't have gems.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:31.860]  What?
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.220]  I can't do either of these.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.440]  This counts as two bedrooms.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.500]  So we're gonna have to redraw.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.300]  Yes.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:40.300]  Great.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:40.840]  Good.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.700]  I'm glad you kept that.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:44.760]  Well...
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.180]  Utility closet.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:45.500]  Hey!
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.100]  We get to know what the breaker box does, boys!
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:49.360]  That's exciting.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.100]  Every room's an education.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:50.860]  Yep.
[01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:01.530]  Whoa!
[01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.650]  I quit.
[01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:04.770]  Oh, wait.
[01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:06.250]  I can turn the light on in the dark room.
[01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:07.190]  Yep.
[01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:09.670]  Uh...
[01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:10.650]  Turn off the keycard.
[01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:13.430]  And you can turn the light off in the gymnasium, interestingly.
[01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.990]  Oh, really?
[01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:16.070]  Is that good?
[01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:17.150]  Let's go ahead and do that.
[01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:18.750]  It means, yeah, you don't...
[01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:19.650]  It doesn't take your steps away.
[01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:20.970]  Got it.
[01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:22.150]  Leave the garage...
[01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:23.670]  Leave the garage on.
[01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:24.090]  Is it?
[01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.330]  Yeah.
[01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:25.310]  Because it's, uh...
[01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:25.750]  I turned it back on.
[01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.590]  You hit that thing before and nothing happened.
[01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:28.110]  Yeah.
[01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.770]  Okay.
[01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:29.690]  What is this?
[01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:31.130]  Can you do anything to those?
[01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:32.010]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:32.690]  To these things?
[01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:34.110]  Yeah.
[01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:35.070]  Oh.
[01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:38.010]  You just didn't press anything?
[01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:40.650]  I mean...
[01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:41.930]  Eric, you're built for this game.
[01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:43.130]  You're built for it.
[01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:44.630]  I don't want to play it.
[01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.050]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:49.650]  I opened that thing and I was like, ooh, you open it and go, ugh, yuck.
[01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.590]  Yuck.
[01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.910]  Hey, check it out.
[01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:52.750]  Think again.
[01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:53.550]  Ugh.
[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.290]  I don't want to.
[01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:57.750]  I want to turn off and shoot something.
[01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:59.050]  I want to go into the dark room.
[01:07:59.130 --> 01:07:59.210]  Let's see.
[01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.710]  Go into the dark room.
[01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:00.530]  Go left here.
[01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:02.910]  Have you done the VAC indicator puzzle, Gavin?
[01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:04.330]  Yeah.
[01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:08.110]  Oh, there you go.
[01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:09.510]  Whoa, your dad.
[01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:10.290]  Wow.
[01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.590]  Oh.
[01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:14.510]  What does it say?
[01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:15.510]  What does your card say, sir?
[01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:19.350]  It said, ooh.
[01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:21.370]  Oh.
[01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:22.010]  Ooh.
[01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.410]  Oh.
[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:26.230]  Is the code on the tree?
[01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:28.110]  I don't know.
[01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:28.810]  Can you read it?
[01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:30.210]  Not in the picture.
[01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:34.570]  I bet you could if it was...
[01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:35.190]  Ooh, a card.
[01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:37.890]  Must be for security.
[01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:38.250]  Sweet.
[01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:40.270]  Glad I was able to power down the doors before that.
[01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:45.410]  You can turn it back on.
[01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:46.170]  Yeah.
[01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:47.510]  Or I could just...
[01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.930]  Last steps.
[01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:49.750]  We'll cautiously step.
[01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:51.090]  Yeah, but I don't...
[01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.770]  What?
[01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:58.110]  Last development was too dark, so keep an eye on that.
[01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:00.870]  So is there one photo that's dark in here?
[01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:03.710]  We just need to...
[01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:04.470]  Ooh, a camera.
[01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:07.530]  There he is, your dad.
[01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.350]  They're slappy.
[01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:10.890]  Oh dear.
[01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:12.350]  Ah, don't kill us.
[01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.910]  Ten.
[01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:20.570]  Same picture again.
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:27.940]  Okay.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.080]  All right.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:30.960]  They really like that picture.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:31.380]  Okay.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.900]  Oh, are they holding something different?
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.360]  Hold on.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.100]  Oh, what's it focusing on behind them here?
[01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:45.330]  What were the maids?
[01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:46.230]  What was the number?
[01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.450]  What was the number for the maids in the chat?
[01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.310]  In the chapel room that we were looking at.
[01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:51.950]  Don't go into it, because I don't want you to lose stuff.
[01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:52.430]  I know, I know.
[01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:52.930]  I'm thinking.
[01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:54.750]  They were...
[01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:55.650]  Oh, maybe I can look from here.
[01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:56.430]  Hold on.
[01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:03.410]  I've done quite a lot of peeking around the corners and directions before.
[01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:04.370]  Yeah.
[01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:05.450]  Can we look at these?
[01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.610]  Here we go.
[01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.770]  Hello.
[01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.290]  Hello.
[01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.990]  Hello.
[01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:13.290]  Stop showing me this guy!
[01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:16.390]  I don't want to see him anymore.
[01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:20.070]  He's doing, you know, 1993 selfies.
[01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:25.290]  It's the classic thinking you're taking a forward-facing picture on your phone.
[01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:28.830]  Okay, well...
[01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.270]  I wonder who the first person was to take a picture the wrong way.
[01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:35.570]  What do you think it was of?
[01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:38.410]  Well, of their own chin, I assume.
[01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:44.410]  Just imagining somebody at, like, some amazing landmark like Niagara Falls,
[01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:47.650]  and they go home to develop their film, and it's just all of them.
[01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.810]  It's just all of their face looking at it.
[01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:52.770]  I mean, that's something that a lot of people don't get, though.
[01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:55.210]  It's their own reaction to Niagara Falls.
[01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:56.370]  That's true.
[01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:57.210]  It's true.
[01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:59.750]  What is that dog tag?
[01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:03.410]  I don't... it's not clickable, so I wonder if it's not important.
[01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:05.310]  Oh, it's significant.
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:07.030]  I just don't know what for yet.
[01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.510]  Well, it's how many steps we have left.
[01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:10.250]  Oh, shit!
[01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:11.410]  Oh, wow!
[01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:14.670]  That's actually... that's pretty interesting.
[01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.910]  Sure made me pay attention.
[01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:20.770]  Getting all the way to rank 9 is...
[01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:22.470]  For day 2? Is today day 2?
[01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:23.950]  Today is day 2.
[01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.070]  That was a pretty impressive vertical build, I gotta say.
[01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:28.030]  Thank you!
[01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.070]  I don't think I did that for a few days, because...
[01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:32.910]  What does the note say about something's enlarged? What is it?
[01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:34.030]  It's, uh...
[01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:36.510]  The print of the ladyship, I assume.
[01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:40.010]  The west wing as well is an enlarged print of the enclosed photo.
[01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:44.510]  He said the last development was too dark, so keep an eye on that.
[01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:48.450]  An enlarged print of the enclosed photograph.
[01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:49.350]  Well, let's do this one.
[01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:50.330]  Which one? That one?
[01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:54.830]  I assume... well, the ladyship was the one for the hall.
[01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:55.090]  Yeah.
[01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.090]  So this one was to be enlarged, I guess.
[01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:58.990]  Unless that tree is called his ladyship.
[01:11:59.650 --> 01:11:59.890]  Right.
[01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.790]  Yeah.
[01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:01.890]  Is that tree your mom?
[01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:07.170]  I guess we just don't have to.
[01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:08.470]  Interesting tree.
[01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:12.410]  Maybe we could run out to the tree real fast before the end of the day.
[01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:14.910]  Just real fast. We got ten steps, should be done real quick.
[01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:15.470]  We'll never make it.
[01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:18.750]  Do you want to look at anything else?
[01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:22.270]  No, no, I think, you know...
[01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:25.450]  There's more to these photos, I just don't know what...
[01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:26.290]  Can you look at that one again?
[01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:27.630]  Which one? This one over here?
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.440]  Oh, shit.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:34.320]  What?
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.740]  You just figured something out, Gavin?
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:36.760]  That helped me out.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:37.520]  Thanks, Nate.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:37.980]  Oh, shit.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.020]  The maids' photos?
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.940]  Yeah, there's something here.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.340]  Go ahead and boot up this game.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.440]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.160]  What is that?
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.640]  There's... what's that?
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.220]  What's the thing behind them?
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.040]  It's like a... oh, is it a TV stand or a blackboard? What is that?
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:12:59.980]  I don't know.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:00.740]  Window, maybe.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.340]  Well, under the window.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.920]  I feel like that's the worst photo to try to figure it out with.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.400]  Yeah.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:10.260]  Okay, well, I was just starting to look there, and then I was going to go look at the other ones.
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.220]  Well, you definitely looked at a lot of photos.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.520]  There's another one.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.000]  That's me!
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.500]  I never developed photos in a dark room before.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:19.900]  No.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.080]  Yeah. Used to do it all the time in the army.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:22.940]  Is it fun?
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.200]  Yeah, it's a lot of fun. It's also a dark room, so they're not allowed to turn the lights on, so you can take naps and nobody can catch you.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.940]  Wouldn't it smell of chemicals, though?
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.480]  What do you care? You're 18 years old. The chemicals are part of the attraction.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.220]  He looks like he just got caught taking a nap.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.160]  They help you sleep.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:39.520]  Yeah.
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:42.560]  I guess the chemicals in there are better than all the gasoline you have.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.080]  Can the shovel be used outside?
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:47.940]  You already used the shovel.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:48.560]  Outside.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.860]  If there's dig holes...
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:55.200]  Oh, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.260]  I see it, I see it, I see it.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.740]  Anywhere you see a dig hole, if you have a shovel, you can dig.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:06.960]  I feel like everyone plays these games and maybe their patience declines a few points from like a 10.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.200]  Eric starts these games at minus 1.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.120]  I don't want to play it. I don't want anything to do with it.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.180]  Yum, yum, yum.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:14.820]  Yum, yum.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.680]  Cool, now you can go outside and see if there's any dig holes.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:18.120]  Let's go dig!
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.860]  We can investigate the tree.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:21.660]  Yeah, I know.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.520]  You got 27 steps.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.720]  Why did you act that way?
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.360]  A whole new life.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:28.860]  What?
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.900]  I'm just laughing at Eric's disdain.
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.800]  Ooh, maybe I can smash the door.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:34.580]  Nope.
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:37.320]  I like that thinking though.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:43.160]  Much better than solving a puzzle your grandpa left or whatever the fuck.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.620]  I think he's your uncle.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:46.820]  But I keep calling him grandpa this whole time.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.560]  Give a fuck who it is.
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:49.100]  Grandpa.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.300]  I don't care.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.600]  You would care if you could get a free house.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.060]  Yeah, you gotta get a free house.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.360]  He left me a house and it's like, hey, you gotta solve this puzzle by digging stuff.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.820]  It's like, nah, I don't want to do any of this.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:02.940]  Where the fuck is that tree?
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.400]  You just saw it.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:07.760]  They cut it down.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.460]  Oh, they cut it down.
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.660]  Oh man, that would have been so much easier if it was there.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.920]  Did that just help me out as well?
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.080]  He's going to the right. Please turn around.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:22.620]  Please turn around.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.760]  I'm turning, I'm turning.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.880]  Where? What do you want?
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:25.460]  Go straight.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.440]  I'm opening my notes.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.320]  Is there anything over here?
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.180]  Looking down at any of the stuff on the other side of the fence?
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.320]  Like, anything in here?
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:45.600]  This is a great feature. It's like hiring fresh eyes for stuff that I've already written off as seen.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.620]  But I haven't seen. I'm an idiot.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.100]  Go to your tent.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.260]  Okay.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.740]  Is that log?
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.020]  Nope.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:54.680]  Sorry.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:55.900]  This one.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:03.600]  There's a cut down tree. I wanted to see if the tree is around anywhere that would have the code on it.
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.600]  Or whatever that's carved into the tree.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.000]  But I don't see a fallen log thing.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.660]  That's a cool thing.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:12.280]  Can you also look at the pot? Is there anything you can do with a pot?
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:12.760]  I tried.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:13.520]  Okay.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.460]  Oh, maybe I can sledge these.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:17.940]  Nope.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.660]  Again, I don't think so, but I like the way you're thinking.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.360]  Listen, I just want to smash some stuff.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.280]  Get Andy Dufresne and just go through the wall.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.000]  Get around.
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.820]  Can I drop anything off here?
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.340]  Your consciousness.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.740]  Your cares and your worries.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.840]  Look along this wall and stuff.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.660]  Worries for another day.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:36.700]  Down at Fraggle Rock.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.000]  Down at Fraggle Rock.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.020]  Trying to dig to Fraggle Rock?
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.140]  Why not?
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.240]  They could probably help me, the little bastards.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:48.360]  Here, let's go check the lower section of the yard over here.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.660]  That's the big twist at the end of this game, is it's the house from Fraggle Rock.
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.540]  This is one of Fraggle Room in the back.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.100]  What's inside the 46th room?
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.580]  Anything over there?
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.120]  It's you and the 46 Fraggles.
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.360]  Does that look like it could be anything?
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:06.260]  Mountain.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.240]  It's what you're looking at.
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.260]  Looks like a mountain to me.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.760]  Oh, that might be dirt. Is that dirt? No, it's just a rock.
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:13.020]  Fuck.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.420]  So exciting to see dirt, isn't it?
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.260]  It did look like dirt.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:17.540]  Turn around.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.420]  Is that a gate over there?
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:19.880]  Yeah.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.140]  I thought there was something leaning up against it.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.840]  What a cock tease that was.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:32.200]  What?
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.020]  I just don't think you hear cock tease that much.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.840]  I've also never looked at a gate and thought, what a cock tease.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.100]  I don't think the person who designed that gate was like, this will tease the cocks out there.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.560]  Oh, no.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.260]  Oh, that's pipe two.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.480]  That's pipe one.
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:01.140]  We're missing something over by the orchard.
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:02.260]  We're missing a lot.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.620]  Yeah, but there's something that we can solve over there, I think.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:07.940]  Oh, if we have a code.
[01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.890]  Thanks, man.
[01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.970]  That's a thing we can solve.
[01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:16.270]  Hey, you're welcome.
[01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:21.450]  I'm following Eric's suggestion of checking fallen logs.
[01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.210]  This was a good one.
[01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.010]  Can you smash that with a hammer?
[01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:25.090]  That's what I was thinking.
[01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:27.630]  Cock tease.
[01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:31.670]  I mean, it didn't just rattle at me.
[01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:34.530]  I feel like it's overused, though.
[01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:35.430]  That'd be real tease.
[01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:37.690]  Oh, look, there's a water pipe over there.
[01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:40.310]  Oh, I didn't even see that.
[01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:42.370]  There's a lot of apples in those trees.
[01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:43.370]  That's going to be...
[01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:47.170]  I think that is going to turn on those pipes that you saw.
[01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:51.270]  This is a Mario game.
[01:18:54.190 --> 01:18:55.210]  Nothing's written anywhere.
[01:18:58.210 --> 01:18:59.490]  Mushroom shoots out of the pipe.
[01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:02.130]  Back to those pictures, do they have anything else in them?
[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:04.710]  I don't think so.
[01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:05.230]  I don't remember.
[01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.910]  I don't either.
[01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:07.730]  Stupid fucking apples.
[01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.150]  Just a bunch of fucking apples.
[01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:11.290]  It's just apples fucking everywhere.
[01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:12.030]  It gives a shit.
[01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:14.370]  Hey, maybe apples are a day three problem.
[01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:16.370]  I think they know why they call it the Angry Orchard.
[01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:21.170]  Because Eric was there.
[01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:22.310]  This game.
[01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:23.510]  I hate this game.
[01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:26.830]  I despise this.
[01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:29.490]  I would say it's my favorite game I've played this year.
[01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:30.330]  That's awesome.
[01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:33.810]  I've heard it from so many people, and so many people have told me,
[01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.070]  you don't play this, you'll hate it.
[01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:36.630]  And I went, oh, that sounds right.
[01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:39.170]  What if you get 50 bucks if you beat the game?
[01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:40.270]  What?
[01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:41.050]  I'm going to end the day.
[01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:43.410]  You're going to what?
[01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:44.130]  I'm going to call it a day.
[01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:45.470]  What if I put a bounty on the...
[01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:48.090]  I don't want to play this.
[01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:48.650]  Room 46.
[01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:50.430]  I don't want to play this.
[01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:51.770]  Did you just call it a day?
[01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:53.270]  No.
[01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:54.850]  You sure did.
[01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:57.890]  Shall we wrap the video on day three?
[01:19:58.890 --> 01:19:59.750]  I guess we should.
[01:19:59.890 --> 01:19:59.950]  Yeah.
[01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:02.010]  That's fine.
[01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:03.790]  That's good progress for a day.
[01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:04.090]  Look at that.
[01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.770]  Yeah, look at that.
[01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:05.550]  Not bad, dude.
[01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:06.850]  25 total rooms.
[01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:07.510]  Two rooms away.
[01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.970]  One panel of the antechamber.
[01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:10.630]  Yeah.
[01:20:12.370 --> 01:20:13.670]  You learned you could turn on the dark room?
[01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:16.070]  You learned the power box thing?
[01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:16.410]  Yeah.
[01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:18.550]  Might want to get a utility closet.
[01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:21.230]  Well, thanks for watching, everybody.
[01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:32.010]  If you solve this, don't leave comments about how we fucked it all up.
[01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:33.070]  We know we did.
[01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.330]  Don't worry about that.
[01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.830]  That's...
[01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:35.410]  We got it.
[01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:36.170]  Don't worry.
[01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.910]  It's all good.
[01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:40.170]  Tune in for parts two through 200 coming soon.
[01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:40.590]  Oh, no.
[01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:41.310]  Oh, no.
[01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:44.390]  With Eric playing the game.
[01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:44.670]  No.
[01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.890]  Bye.
[01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.470]  Comment if you want Eric to play.
[01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.970]  Yeah.
[01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.330]  No!
[01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:51.510]  Eric, does this cloud save?
[01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:52.650]  I can just give it my account.
[01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:54.170]  You just throw it in the fucking trash.
