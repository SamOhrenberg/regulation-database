[00:00.000 --> 00:07.540]  Hello and welcome to another GTA heist. We got new heists. A new heist is here.
[00:07.620 --> 00:12.160]  We finished the old ones. Now we're doing the doomsday. How's everybody doing?
[00:12.320 --> 00:14.520]  Why is it snowing in the middle of June?
[00:15.100 --> 00:17.800]  Because it's not June, it's December.
[00:18.200 --> 00:24.820]  It's August! We're doing Andrew's seasonal August, uh, content idea.
[00:24.900 --> 00:28.740]  Oh no. Oh, mountain lion. Gavin, Gavin, pick me up fast. I'm mountain lion. Gavin.
[00:29.560 --> 00:34.080]  I'm coming. Gavin, stretch your legs out and allow me a moment to tell you a little thing
[00:34.080 --> 00:42.920]  about global warming. You see, the Earth is changing. Uh, I feel like you're actually
[00:42.920 --> 00:46.380]  gonna tell me something about global warming and then... Al Gore, there you go.
[00:47.540 --> 00:54.020]  Yes, yes, come in, come in, come in. Have a seat anywhere.
[00:54.580 --> 00:58.960]  This is the one room in the country where we cannot be recorded.
[00:58.960 --> 01:08.560]  Can I take this mask off now? Do you know Avon Hurts? Avon Hurts. Yes, the Avon Hurts.
[01:09.300 --> 01:13.040]  Don't act all weird. Are you guys in this cutscene? Easter? No.
[01:13.580 --> 01:17.400]  Okay. I'm in a helicopter. Well, uh, Lester is telling me about heist stuff,
[01:17.500 --> 01:21.180]  just so you know I can skip it. Thank god. I mean, at least I don't have to hear it.
[01:21.180 --> 01:24.280]  Are you getting, like, the intro to Doomsday, probably? Yeah, they're like,
[01:24.340 --> 01:27.460]  buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. As long as you don't have to watch it again.
[01:27.600 --> 01:31.560]  To the heist lobby when you get in. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I don't, I've been,
[01:31.900 --> 01:35.480]  I'm on record as... Oh, we're already, we started. Oh, cool. Oh, we're in. Oh,
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.680]  shit. Wow. Okay. All right, let's go, Eric. Okay, uh, team tape, together forever,
[01:40.820 --> 01:45.980]  let's do this thing. Hey, no bad ideas. Uh, I'm trying to set a marker down, it won't let me.
[01:45.980 --> 01:50.380]  Just, uh, it's south. Just go south. Andrew. I'll remove my marker, then you can. Let me,
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.860]  let me, here, I got it. Yeah, pillbox, pill medical center. Oh, there, there you go. Trust
[01:55.860 --> 02:01.760]  me. Where? Where is it? It's right over here. You did it. Okay. Okay, paramedic equipment, baby.
[02:02.340 --> 02:08.640]  We're going to die. Are you guys, do you have the same objective? Yep, go to pillbox medical
[02:08.640 --> 02:14.180]  center. Okay. We're a little far away, we're six miles. We're going to a medical center.
[02:14.960 --> 02:18.700]  We're, I mean, we're in a helicopter and we're doing cool stuff. So, uh, Gavin,
[02:18.780 --> 02:25.440]  are you in Andrew's organization? Yeah, this is an Andrew-funded helicopter. It is. Oh, no, really?
[02:26.800 --> 02:32.340]  Oh, shit. You've got a nice selection of associated vehicles. Thank you so much. Thank you so much,
[02:32.400 --> 02:37.940]  Andrew. And it would be a real shame. It'd be a real shame if something happened to it.
[02:38.740 --> 02:44.900]  See? You know what? I take it all back. Well, we are beyond safe. Oh, boy.
[02:46.300 --> 02:51.300]  Even more fun when you do it this way. Oh, it's a white Christmas in Los Angeles. What is this? Los
[02:51.300 --> 02:58.960]  Santos. Los Angeles. Yes. All right, Eric, are we going to jump or are we going to pop?
[02:59.760 --> 03:02.800]  Uh, what do you want? You want to jump? We can just jump. We don't need this helicopter.
[03:03.220 --> 03:06.500]  Oh, yeah. I didn't pay for it. We can both jump. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,
[03:06.500 --> 03:11.080]  Rachel's early. Oh, you jumped really early. It might be. It might get deducted from my pay.
[03:12.320 --> 03:14.300]  There we go. Heading on over.
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.080]  We don't need to land on the roof, do we? No, I assume not. I assume it's going to be a
[03:24.080 --> 03:30.560]  ambulance. Yeah. Boom. Oh, God. I skid on the ground. Oh, there you are. Hey, we're looking
[03:30.560 --> 03:38.220]  good. Oh, yeah. They ruined this, didn't they? Yeah. Where the hell are we? Okay. Stealing an
[03:38.220 --> 03:45.080]  ambulance. Got it. Do you want to get in the back? Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. Ow. Get in. All right,
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.840]  go. Go, go, go. You got so much blood on the back of our ambulance. Oh, man. All right,
[03:50.900 --> 03:59.780]  sing the theme tune to Casualty. Go. What is Casualty? Casualty. Casualty.
[04:00.560 --> 04:09.980]  It's a casualty. Casualty. Casualty. That's pretty good. Yeah, I've seen it.
[04:10.760 --> 04:12.460]  I love it when a death comes together.
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.880]  Get off road, sons. Do it. Whatever it takes, baby. We're on our way to help. We'll be there.
[04:19.880 --> 04:21.000]  We're on our way to help.
[04:28.400 --> 04:35.100]  I'm having a great time. This is fantastic. I'll be honest, an ambulance is not a very good
[04:35.100 --> 04:40.880]  snowy off-road vehicle. No, so far it's not. And we're also going up to go...
[04:42.460 --> 04:45.560]  Yeah, I get what you're going for, I guess. I'm just trying to lose the fuzz.
[04:46.040 --> 04:48.220]  Oh, yeah. I think we're going right into the fuzz, buddy.
[04:48.740 --> 04:53.700]  This is the fuzz hole? I think the fuzz is coming around the bend. I think the fuzz is coming right
[04:53.700 --> 05:00.280]  up on us. Yeah, here we go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Initiated anti-fuzz technology.
[05:00.580 --> 05:04.480]  Now we're going to have to... Oh, no, there's more fuzz coming. Don't worry about it. Yeah.
[05:06.100 --> 05:14.520]  Oh, here they went in the hills, Andrew. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, Gavin.
[05:14.520 --> 05:17.200]  Oh, they're on the main road. They're straight ahead of us. All right, and then we're on the
[05:17.200 --> 05:25.880]  main road. There you go. And we outran the fuzz, baby. That was some cold fuzz. That was...
[05:28.260 --> 05:32.360]  There they are. There they are. Hey, guys. What are you guys in? Is that like a snow plow?
[05:33.080 --> 05:40.300]  Oh, cool. On my way. They have the cops on them, Gavin. We got to get out of here. Oh, my God.
[05:40.300 --> 05:45.060]  All right, you guys, get in front of us and run. Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, yeah, we should leave.
[05:45.400 --> 05:50.800]  We'll leave. Oh, God. We're going to kill them. No, it's good. This is great. Okay. But let's
[05:50.800 --> 05:59.760]  cut to the opposite side of the road for cinematic's sake. Yeah. Go into the other lane.
[06:00.740 --> 06:06.460]  What the fuck? Get on this side. That was awesome. I see what they're saying. I see what they're
[06:06.460 --> 06:13.200]  saying. Go left, go left, go left. There we go. All right. Where do I get this car? This is the
[06:13.200 --> 06:20.440]  only car I want. What the fuck, Gavin? Oh, no. You didn't flip it that good. What are you doing?
[06:20.820 --> 06:32.200]  Oh, you're going back. You got to keep going. On our way. Get in front. Get in front. Oh,
[06:32.780 --> 06:36.380]  this is so far away. Catch it up.
[06:37.320 --> 06:44.680]  Sorry. So sorry. So sorry. What the fuck are you doing? It's bad.
[06:46.020 --> 06:51.820]  I'm trying to lose the cops. You're doing a bad job. Don't shoot against the wanted level, you
[06:51.820 --> 07:02.180]  fool. I want them to stay away from us. Andrew, what are you doing? Oh, I was pulling Lester to
[07:02.180 --> 07:08.360]  where they go. Oh, we lost higher. Oh, higher down. Where is his mark? Eric, tell me what is
[07:08.360 --> 07:13.400]  it like on the other side? Why are you going straight? Why don't you follow the the map on
[07:13.400 --> 07:20.220]  the road? I like to go is what's your what? The eagle flies. Well, they went high. OK, so you're
[07:20.220 --> 07:26.200]  you just like dumb or what? Like it puts it down so that way you can just follow it. Yeah. All right.
[07:26.200 --> 07:33.300]  Sometimes it's quick to go across the road. Oh, we don't have the wheels for that. Yeah, all right.
[07:35.840 --> 07:41.820]  Fuck. OK, there's a lot. Oh, we have two helicopters. Oh, that explains a lot.
[07:42.380 --> 07:47.160]  We're almost we're almost there now. I think because this heist seems to just start no
[07:47.160 --> 07:51.540]  matter where anyone is on the map. Yeah. I think team No Bad Idea should always be in the ramp car.
[07:51.540 --> 07:56.120]  And that ramp car is pretty good. And we should always do the whole delivery.
[07:56.920 --> 08:00.380]  Yeah. I mean, ramp car seems to be working. Well, I don't know where it is now, though.
[08:01.320 --> 08:05.420]  Well, we lost two wheels and got lost trying to follow you guys off road.
[08:05.800 --> 08:10.720]  Oh, OK. Yeah. I can't believe. Yeah. Gavin, why did we do that to them? I can't believe it.
[08:11.420 --> 08:14.980]  I can't believe that. OK. Done by an ambulance.
[08:16.760 --> 08:21.020]  The ambulance is fine, too. I'm like, you can just see me in the back, right? You just see
[08:21.020 --> 08:25.940]  the rat. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got a new I changed outfits because it was a little cold.
[08:26.040 --> 08:30.000]  I got kind of like a big coat on. I do think you're the one that popped our tires.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.160]  Oh, I definitely shot at you. A hundred percent. Yeah. When you were unloading,
[08:34.200 --> 08:39.220]  I think you popped our tires. I felt like you were getting too close to us and I didn't like it. So I
[08:39.220 --> 08:45.980]  just sort of I took matters into my own rat hands. Rat club. Don't talk about that's the first rule.
[08:46.040 --> 08:50.580]  Don't talk about it. Hey, here's a second rule. Don't shoot out our tires. I like that rule.
[08:50.580 --> 08:54.640]  That's honestly not on the list of rules. Sorry. Oh, I'm going to talk about Rat Club then.
[08:57.380 --> 09:01.880]  Next is going to text all his friends. You heard about Rat Club? Hey guys,
[09:01.920 --> 09:05.520]  you know about Rat Club? You heard about this? You seen this? That's right. That's right. When
[09:05.520 --> 09:09.060]  you text all your friends, have you heard about Rat Club? You're really going to get me.
[09:11.520 --> 09:13.900]  Yeah. You guys sort of rent that auto online.
[09:14.280 --> 09:17.760]  Your wife has to take you aside. Hey, you got to stop talking about Rat Club.
[09:20.580 --> 09:21.880]  He's making you look crazy.
[09:26.900 --> 09:30.180]  I gotta say, I was pretty excited by the snow the first year it came in.
[09:30.680 --> 09:36.020]  Yeah. Here we are 10 years later. It's kind of annoying. Now, the first year it came in, did you
[09:36.900 --> 09:43.000]  get 25 snowmen or is that like a more recent thing? No, a bit more recent.
[09:44.620 --> 09:49.040]  Oh yeah? How recent? This year? Yesterday. Depends on when this video comes out.
[09:53.150 --> 10:00.370]  Oh, we're at the bunker. Oh, okay. Hey, we delivered it. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. We did the thing.
[10:01.150 --> 10:07.550]  Go repair this. How? There's a spray shop right around the corner. How do... I want that car in
[10:07.550 --> 10:12.150]  like day-to-day use. Is that something I can do? Yeah, it's a special... there's like a bunch of
[10:12.150 --> 10:17.310]  special vehicle missions we could do to get them all. Go straight. Oh god. There's also like a...
[10:17.310 --> 10:21.390]  It's easier said than done. A big plow truck that's awesome.
[10:22.630 --> 10:30.490]  Whoa! The phantom wedge. Dude, you just like fell down into the ground. That was crazy. Oh shit.
[10:31.030 --> 10:37.530]  Yeah, it was pretty cool. Could we start the next part? I'm starting it. I just had to repair the
[10:37.530 --> 10:47.190]  car. Jesus Christ. Give me a minute. Oh, I'm just asking. Yeah. Hey, there's Nick. Hey boys! Oh,
[10:47.190 --> 10:54.490]  I swear to god, if you fucking pop the tires immediately, I'm gonna fucking blow up that
[10:54.490 --> 11:01.930]  helicopter so fast. Do you think this will pop the tires? There's no way this will pop the tires.
[11:03.910 --> 11:05.650]  Uh-oh, he's stopped. Andrew, go in there.
[11:15.930 --> 11:20.690]  I'm slowly cycling to a weapon that would do that, and then I just turned to see the bodies
[11:20.690 --> 11:26.410]  flying through the sky. That really hurt. Hey Nick, are you unarmed? Hit left on the d-pad.
[11:27.630 --> 11:34.170]  Okay. No, no. Wait, look at this. Yeah, I'm trying to get you to pick up snowballs. I'm
[11:34.170 --> 11:38.010]  shooting snowballs. Yeah, I'm hitting you in the dick with snowballs. Me and Nick are
[11:38.010 --> 11:43.230]  having a snowball fight. Oh yeah? Yeah. Where'd you go? There you are. Oh, I fell. Is that
[11:43.230 --> 11:51.490]  initiation into Rat Club? Yeah, he hit me in the head with it and just went down. Don't talk about
[11:51.490 --> 11:57.230]  it. Did you catch on fire? Yeah, I did. Stop, stay away from me.
[12:00.210 --> 12:11.470]  Oh dude. I keep catching on fire. Nick keeps catching on fire. New prep. New prep, let's do it.
[12:11.730 --> 12:17.770]  All right, let's do this together. New prep. All right, Gavin, what are we doing? Uh, well, I can't
[12:17.770 --> 12:25.030]  spawn the chopper because Nick blew it up. Okay. There goes Andrew. Andrew's out of here. Andrew,
[12:25.070 --> 12:30.190]  where's your car? I'm looking. All right, let's get in this one. Oh, did I get snow on the seat?
[12:30.670 --> 12:37.250]  Did you get underglow on this? Yeah. It's nice. It really works with the snow.
[12:38.130 --> 12:44.670]  You can tell it's nice by the way Gavin said that. Oh, it's nice. Wait a minute, you didn't
[12:44.670 --> 12:50.990]  mean that. I said 60%. You lied to me the whole time? I got it because you said it's cool.
[12:52.330 --> 12:56.710]  Hey Frosty, get in. Oh, you're lucky I'm a bad driver.
[12:58.090 --> 13:04.910]  Hey, you're lucky I suck shit. Hey, where are you going? I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh, the squad.
[13:06.150 --> 13:13.050]  We're together again. What happened to your ramp? Somebody blew it up. Nobody blew it up. Nobody
[13:13.050 --> 13:20.210]  did anything to it. No, you definitely blew it up. I got a notification for it. Oh, that might
[13:20.210 --> 13:23.930]  have been the chopper. The chopper exploded. Yeah, maybe Nick blew it up with the chopper.
[13:24.890 --> 13:31.390]  Oh, maybe. No, hey, stop that. No. Nick was agreeing and then realized what he was agreeing
[13:31.390 --> 13:38.910]  with and stopped. Like, hey. Yeah, that's right. So, what are we doing on this mission, Andrew?
[13:38.910 --> 13:40.850]  Yeah, we're going to Richmond. Okay.
[13:44.330 --> 13:48.030]  Where are we going next? Is that a name or a title? I don't know. We'll find out once we get to
[13:48.030 --> 13:53.010]  Richmond. Is this kind of like a Kojima thing? Like, is this like Ultimate Rich Man or something?
[13:53.250 --> 13:59.050]  It is, yeah. It's played by Nicholas Winding Refn. It's like a Spear Director thing.
[13:59.610 --> 14:06.830]  It's pretty cool. Yeah. Hey, can you pay for these lights? Yeah, Gavin said it would look cool.
[14:07.430 --> 14:11.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He said it was nice. Gavin did like a prank on him.
[14:11.190 --> 14:12.290]  Press Y to dim the lights.
[14:15.670 --> 14:20.850]  He almost did. He thought about it. He thought about it. You know what? I'm gonna go turn these
[14:20.850 --> 14:25.550]  off after this. Oh, we gotta get Deluxos. Oh, hell yeah. That's bottom right. I just noticed.
[14:25.750 --> 14:33.050]  Is Deluxos a car? Yeah. The flying car. Okay. What? Really? Excuse me. Well, eventually you
[14:33.050 --> 14:36.610]  can make them fly, I think. I think it's actually a normal car. Okay, so these probably aren't
[14:36.610 --> 14:43.690]  flying. Well, maybe not. Not yet. Okay. We'll find out. Press Y to...
[14:50.850 --> 14:59.670]  That was so fucking crazy. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. A bit more severe looking.
[15:02.250 --> 15:05.910]  I somehow got in front of the car and was going faster than the vehicle.
[15:06.670 --> 15:09.730]  It felt like you were affecting the car's course.
[15:12.870 --> 15:20.610]  They buried people for less than that. Oh, man. What was great was Gavin not even coming up with
[15:20.610 --> 15:25.930]  the joke part of press Y to dim the lights. Hell yeah.
[15:29.430 --> 15:35.150]  Oh, Jesus. What are you doing? Well, he turned in front of us, man.
[15:39.680 --> 15:43.260]  Okay. What else could it be? All right. When we get to this yellow dot, let's do a group dive.
[15:44.040 --> 15:50.160]  Okay. Okay. Ready? All right. Ready? One, two, three.
[15:58.120 --> 16:05.040]  Take out the guards. That was not the best move we've ever made.
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.340]  That was one of my worst ones.
[16:15.080 --> 16:18.480]  Holy crap. Don't forget to eat snacks and shit so we don't have to do this.
[16:21.140 --> 16:27.740]  Don't curse. Stop cursing. We're gonna get demonetized. One of the guards that I just
[16:27.740 --> 16:32.080]  killed. I blew his fucking head off. I got a key. Oh, Keeman.
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.520]  Get that garage door open and look inside. Car key, man. Kojima, is that you? That's a Square Enix game.
[16:39.820 --> 16:46.740]  Oh, holy shit. Kingdom of Keeman. Did you see me rip that dude in the back of the head? Whoa,
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.220]  they're in the garage. What garage? What? How do we get there? Oh, the garage is in the front? Okay.
[16:52.380 --> 16:58.560]  Let's get inside. Steal AD Lux before these cops come. What would Kojima call a guy who always said hi?
[16:58.560 --> 17:00.740]  Hi, ma'am.
[17:06.950 --> 17:09.390]  I think you would call him Pleasantriesman.
[17:12.110 --> 17:15.310]  So it's this thing? It's the red thing? It's the DeLorean. Okay.
[17:18.530 --> 17:22.650]  Now what? Now we drive! Okay. What are we driving to?
[17:24.330 --> 17:27.330]  LS Customs. Oh, hell yeah. What color are you gonna make yours?
[17:29.130 --> 17:35.630]  I don't know. Hey, bud. Hey, can you bring your car so I can say I want my car to look like those
[17:35.630 --> 17:43.370]  lights? Whatever shade that is. Just do all of that. Like a haircut magazine? Exactly.
[17:45.670 --> 17:50.410]  Can you come with me to the car spray shop? I really like the color of your car.
[17:51.570 --> 17:55.650]  A photo would not suffice. They need to see it. A haircut magazine?
[17:58.510 --> 18:02.710]  I just gotta re-spray. Is it? Yeah, okay.
[18:05.550 --> 18:10.710]  What are you doing? I'm going past you. Gotta speed up. Fuck!
[18:12.530 --> 18:19.270]  I drove into the door. Nick is causing issues. Archie walked in here and he's like, what are you doing?
[18:21.310 --> 18:23.370]  I'm here for the magic touch. What color are you guys doing?
[18:24.610 --> 18:28.130]  Uh, what do I want? Cool. I'm going teal.
[18:30.390 --> 18:35.330]  I want to be inconspicuous. I painted my car like my favorite browser.
[18:39.530 --> 18:46.710]  Okay, I did it. All right, I went pure gold. I went this ugly-ass pearl lesson.
[18:47.250 --> 18:53.850]  Oh my god, that's crazy. Look at the color change. Yeah, isn't that nuts? You're like a chamomile.
[19:04.550 --> 19:08.490]  Oh no, it's color change-men. Oh, chamomile?
[19:08.490 --> 19:15.450]  Are those those lizards that change color?
[19:24.930 --> 19:30.470]  You took that turn crazy. I went a bit much on that.
[19:33.710 --> 19:36.930]  Chamomile. Do we have to drive this all the way north?
[19:36.930 --> 19:40.950]  Do we take this all the way to your bunker? Yeah, because Andrew bought the furthest away bunker.
[19:45.110 --> 19:46.570]  No shark cards.
[19:49.490 --> 19:52.950]  Why didn't you just go eggshell the shark cards before we got shut down?
[19:54.030 --> 19:58.290]  We didn't have any money to use on shark cards. Well, we didn't know that.
[19:58.830 --> 20:00.570]  I think someone had an amex that was still on.
[20:00.570 --> 20:08.880]  I guess I would have just gotten yelled at, but that would have been the extent of it.
[20:10.600 --> 20:15.660]  I think I might have the most Warner Brothers funded GTA account of anyone.
[20:16.440 --> 20:23.540]  That's pretty cool. Where are the other two? I am way up there, I assume. I'm way back.
[20:25.500 --> 20:30.780]  Who's got D4? I do. That's the one Apollo Creed dies in.
[20:31.840 --> 20:34.460]  That is the funniest. I think we've talked about it before.
[20:34.680 --> 20:39.540]  Him coming out to living in America with all the fireworks and all this shit just to get
[20:39.540 --> 20:45.040]  fucking pounded into meat and die. It's so... that is the funniest thing you can do in a movie.
[20:45.180 --> 20:47.920]  That's hilarious. If he dies, he dies.
[20:49.400 --> 20:52.980]  Yeah, yes, there's like fireworks, people dancing and singing. I feel like there's an eagle. I
[20:52.980 --> 20:55.560]  don't know if there is an eagle, but it feels like there's an eagle. I think there is.
[20:55.560 --> 21:01.640]  Was it Christmas or something? No, it was the 80s and American patriotism.
[21:01.940 --> 21:06.380]  It was the most alive you could be before you died.
[21:09.640 --> 21:12.240]  It's just Cold War the movie, but it's boxing.
[21:12.860 --> 21:16.260]  Yeah. Is that the one with the robot? Yes, at the beginning.
[21:16.580 --> 21:19.080]  Yeah, Pauly. Hey, what's up? Hey, Rock, I got the robot.
[21:19.400 --> 21:21.680]  Pauly, you don't need the robot. It's great.
[21:23.140 --> 21:28.200]  It's my best friend, Rock. Is it in the director's cut or was it cut out?
[21:28.420 --> 21:30.620]  There's like a version where the robot's not in it.
[21:31.160 --> 21:37.320]  They cut it out in the more recent director's cut, and Stallone said it's because it didn't
[21:37.320 --> 21:42.220]  fit with the story overall. But people think it's because he had to pay royalties to the
[21:42.220 --> 21:45.560]  company that made the robot. So it was just a way to cut them out.
[21:45.560 --> 21:48.000]  I can't remember what it looked like. Was it the same robot that everyone used back then?
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.740]  What the fuck, Gavin? What are you doing?
[21:53.900 --> 21:58.280]  Don't ask about a robot and drive into me. Twilight Zone robot.
[21:58.720 --> 22:06.600]  I just watched Creed 2 like four days ago, and it is amazing how non-character Ivan Drago is.
[22:06.840 --> 22:09.600]  Yes. He says essentially and does nothing
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.780]  in Rocky 4, and then they brought him back for Creed 2, and he's just as uncompelling as a
[22:15.780 --> 22:19.700]  non-character. If anything more so, because he's not even fighting in that one.
[22:19.820 --> 22:21.480]  He's not even strong anymore. Is it just a cameo?
[22:22.520 --> 22:26.800]  No, the plot of Creed 2 is it's his son versus Apollo Creed 2.
[22:27.380 --> 22:29.680]  Damn. Legacy fights.
[22:30.220 --> 22:30.600]  Yes.
[22:31.980 --> 22:32.760]  Nepo fights, yeah.
[22:33.040 --> 22:35.240]  Yeah, Nepo fights the movie.
[22:38.060 --> 22:41.060]  I think that's what we should call it. Like, bumfights called Nepo fights.
[22:43.460 --> 22:46.760]  I don't want to see Dr. Phil fight. I want to see Dr. Phil's son fight.
[22:48.480 --> 22:50.280]  Dr. Phil's kid fight Oprah's kid.
[22:51.660 --> 22:54.140]  Dr. Phil's kid versus Dr. Oz's kid.
[22:54.420 --> 22:55.240]  No, no, we're talking.
[22:55.680 --> 22:56.120]  We'll see what happens.
[22:56.200 --> 22:56.360]  Yep.
[22:57.460 --> 22:58.100]  I'd watch that.
[22:58.260 --> 22:58.500]  Yep.
[22:59.360 --> 23:00.680]  Won't pay for it, but I'll watch it.
[23:00.960 --> 23:01.120]  Yeah.
[23:01.540 --> 23:03.720]  All the illegals, I'll use Stream East to watch that shit.
[23:03.740 --> 23:05.300]  Yeah, hell yeah. I'll steal that shit.
[23:05.340 --> 23:06.740]  I'll use Crack Streams, I don't give a shit.
[23:06.880 --> 23:07.900]  Oh god, Gavin.
[23:09.340 --> 23:12.100]  That might be the best entrance to a bunker I've ever had.
[23:13.080 --> 23:14.180]  That was pretty something.
[23:17.160 --> 23:19.160]  It's really hard to see roads in the snow.
[23:19.840 --> 23:19.980]  Sure is.
[23:20.420 --> 23:21.060]  Turn on your lights.
[23:25.880 --> 23:26.680]  I'm okay.
[23:28.340 --> 23:31.400]  So, was this, like, bunker free because it's just so far away or what?
[23:31.800 --> 23:32.720]  No, it's just the cheapest.
[23:33.100 --> 23:33.540]  By quite a bit.
[23:34.140 --> 23:34.740]  Still a million.
[23:34.940 --> 23:35.400]  Hey, what's up, Nick?
[23:35.900 --> 23:37.200]  Oh, sorry, fellas.
[23:38.220 --> 23:39.740]  Oh, and then it took me down.
[23:40.620 --> 23:41.660]  Oh, we did it.
[23:42.020 --> 23:43.340]  All right, I'm gonna order another buzzard.
[23:44.520 --> 23:44.920]  Thanks, Andrew.
[23:44.960 --> 23:45.380]  Hell yeah, baby.
[23:46.020 --> 23:46.640]  Thanks, Andrew.
[23:47.740 --> 23:48.340]  No problem.
[23:48.800 --> 23:49.240]  Thanks, Warner.
[23:51.260 --> 23:51.700]  No.
[23:53.740 --> 23:54.620]  Thanks, regulation.
[23:57.280 --> 23:58.300]  We should leave it.
[23:58.380 --> 24:00.240]  I'm gonna ask the fans, should we...
[24:00.960 --> 24:03.100]  Like, this game feels like it's almost over, right?
[24:03.220 --> 24:05.180]  Like, we're near the end.
[24:05.880 --> 24:07.520]  Should we get shark carts?
[24:07.520 --> 24:08.580]  Is that funny?
[24:08.800 --> 24:11.580]  If we do shark carts now, is that funny?
[24:11.980 --> 24:13.280]  This game's made enough money.
[24:14.600 --> 24:18.260]  It's also never been easier to get money in this game, so...
[24:19.660 --> 24:20.440]  We don't really need it.
[24:20.460 --> 24:25.880]  I feel so bad spending other people's money on my personal GTA account.
[24:28.800 --> 24:34.100]  I only want my personal GTA account to be funded by mega corporations.
[24:35.140 --> 24:35.660]  That, okay.
[24:35.860 --> 24:37.500]  Okay, I can understand that.
[24:40.720 --> 24:41.520]  Woo-hoo!
[24:42.960 --> 24:43.340]  Oh, well.
[24:43.580 --> 24:44.580]  Wait, did you guys jump out?
[24:44.920 --> 24:45.420]  I just did.
[24:45.420 --> 24:45.800]  Andrew did.
[24:46.240 --> 24:46.440]  Why?
[24:49.780 --> 24:50.600]  So we could've...
[24:50.600 --> 24:51.460]  Being average is chill, dude.
[24:52.040 --> 24:53.560]  Enter the control panel.
[24:54.840 --> 24:57.960]  Bet you're feeling real dumb you didn't jump out now.
[24:58.420 --> 24:58.720]  Are we?
[24:58.780 --> 24:59.040]  Why?
[24:59.120 --> 24:59.480]  I guess so.
[25:00.640 --> 25:01.120]  Oh, get him.
[25:01.480 --> 25:01.980]  Oh, no.
[25:02.180 --> 25:03.280]  Oh, no, they got guns!
[25:03.700 --> 25:04.640]  They got guns!
[25:04.920 --> 25:06.200]  Chase him down, chase him down.
[25:06.200 --> 25:07.880]  Hey, I'm a Zancudo.
[25:14.280 --> 25:16.540]  Oh, that hurts so bad!
[25:18.660 --> 25:20.720]  Next time, stay at the chopper, asshole.
[25:22.260 --> 25:23.480]  Oh, fuck me, dude.
[25:25.380 --> 25:27.180]  Holy fuck, that was awesome.
[25:27.300 --> 25:27.860]  Oh, is this not the door?
[25:27.860 --> 25:28.560]  Okay, go to that door.
[25:28.920 --> 25:29.440]  Where are we supposed to go?
[25:30.580 --> 25:31.780]  Where's the damn door?
[25:33.520 --> 25:34.420]  Where's the door?
[25:34.780 --> 25:36.200]  It looked like a door to me!
[25:36.700 --> 25:36.900]  What?
[25:37.320 --> 25:37.680]  Sorry.
[25:37.840 --> 25:38.420]  Wait, you guys go around.
[25:38.740 --> 25:40.120]  Oh, you guys go around the other side.
[25:40.760 --> 25:41.780]  Andrew, you up the tower?
[25:43.100 --> 25:44.140]  I'm running up.
[25:44.720 --> 25:45.040]  Okay.
[25:45.300 --> 25:46.000]  I'm gonna go up the stairs.
[25:46.300 --> 25:46.820]  Gavin, let's do it.
[25:47.100 --> 25:47.600]  I'll be there in a minute.
[25:47.640 --> 25:48.680]  I know a shortcut to the top.
[25:52.720 --> 25:56.600]  So, I realized when initiating this, we're doing the prep for three different missions.
[25:56.780 --> 25:58.420]  So, we'll just be able to hammer out missions.
[25:59.020 --> 26:00.500]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[26:00.500 --> 26:02.860]  Are we going to be able to see them in this?
[26:05.320 --> 26:05.940]  Oh, wow.
[26:05.940 --> 26:06.700]  Can you guys fly up?
[26:06.940 --> 26:07.260]  Yeah.
[26:07.260 --> 26:09.040]  Okay, now we can see...
[26:09.040 --> 26:11.240]  Okay, I have a really good camera shot of this.
[26:12.320 --> 26:14.760]  Andrew, I'm almost...
[26:14.760 --> 26:15.980]  I'm on level four.
[26:16.280 --> 26:16.800]  Where are you at, Nick?
[26:17.300 --> 26:19.160]  I can't wait for them to bust through this door.
[26:19.700 --> 26:20.620]  Hey, you're not that far.
[26:20.800 --> 26:21.340]  Yeah, this is gonna be...
[26:21.340 --> 26:23.340]  Oh, Gavin, my shot...
[26:24.020 --> 26:25.660]  I'm zoomed in on the...
[26:27.400 --> 26:27.780]  Like...
[26:27.780 --> 26:29.240]  I just hit four, Andrew, slow down.
[26:29.500 --> 26:30.760]  Oh, this is gonna be so sick.
[26:30.760 --> 26:32.680]  Oh, there's a lot of stairs between four and five.
[26:32.720 --> 26:35.780]  How are they gonna come up the very top of this room with a man?
[26:36.220 --> 26:37.540]  It's gotta be the room with a guy.
[26:37.760 --> 26:38.760]  It's gotta be the room with a guy.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.040]  It stops at six.
[26:40.700 --> 26:40.960]  Okay.
[26:41.720 --> 26:42.420]  There they are.
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.300]  No, there he is.
[26:44.540 --> 26:45.380]  Wait, isn't that what you're...
[26:45.380 --> 26:46.340]  Are you not supposed to kill him?
[26:47.400 --> 26:47.720]  Nope.
[26:48.440 --> 26:48.760]  What?
[26:49.680 --> 26:50.000]  Wait.
[26:50.080 --> 26:50.680]  I gotta go higher.
[26:51.160 --> 26:51.800]  I gotta go higher.
[26:52.220 --> 26:52.520]  Higher?
[26:52.900 --> 26:53.220]  Okay.
[26:53.420 --> 26:55.320]  All right, so I'm looking up now.
[26:55.540 --> 26:56.060]  Oh, there they are.
[26:57.400 --> 26:57.680]  Hello?
[26:59.940 --> 27:00.940]  Accessing the console.
[27:01.320 --> 27:01.920]  Downloading data.
[27:02.020 --> 27:03.620]  Oh, Nick's in the room.
[27:04.120 --> 27:05.140]  Hey, Nick, could you see out the window?
[27:05.780 --> 27:07.460]  Oh, there you are.
[27:07.560 --> 27:08.340]  Hey, guys.
[27:08.400 --> 27:09.240]  Hey, Nick.
[27:09.740 --> 27:10.440]  Oh, shit.
[27:10.520 --> 27:10.940]  Oh, no!
[27:11.440 --> 27:11.960]  Uh-oh.
[27:12.180 --> 27:13.660]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[27:13.840 --> 27:14.780]  What's going on?
[27:15.900 --> 27:17.300]  Is Nick in his pants?
[27:17.440 --> 27:17.920]  Witnesses!
[27:18.220 --> 27:18.700]  Witnesses!
[27:20.500 --> 27:20.980]  Oh.
[27:22.140 --> 27:23.820]  Andrew, is there a way off the top?
[27:23.980 --> 27:24.520]  Can we jump?
[27:24.780 --> 27:25.160]  Nope.
[27:26.200 --> 27:26.680]  What?
[27:29.300 --> 27:30.760]  I mean, they're shooting at me.
[27:31.820 --> 27:33.200]  Okay, we gotta steal the Akula.
[27:33.680 --> 27:35.200]  APS, wait till it lands.
[27:35.380 --> 27:36.000]  What do we do?
[27:36.140 --> 27:36.860]  Can we shoot out the window?
[27:37.080 --> 27:38.000]  No, we just gotta go down.
[27:38.260 --> 27:39.260]  Damn it, to hell!
[27:39.520 --> 27:40.100]  We can't jump out.
[27:40.200 --> 27:41.400]  There's a big hole there, isn't there?
[27:42.560 --> 27:42.840]  No!
[27:45.680 --> 27:46.220]  Oh, shit!
[27:46.280 --> 27:46.780]  Is there a big hole?
[27:48.240 --> 27:49.400]  Did you blow out the window?
[27:49.720 --> 27:50.720]  Oh, we have an elevator!
[27:50.960 --> 27:51.300]  We're idiots.
[27:52.260 --> 27:52.900]  There's a lift.
[27:53.120 --> 27:53.540]  Way to go, idiots.
[27:53.560 --> 27:54.940]  Wait, could we have taken the elevator up?
[27:54.940 --> 27:55.580]  I think so.
[27:57.100 --> 27:58.340]  All right, get back in the thing.
[27:58.420 --> 27:59.240]  We gotta go to the Akula.
[28:00.300 --> 28:01.640]  Oh, my God, that man died.
[28:02.660 --> 28:03.080]  All right, boys.
[28:03.080 --> 28:04.640]  All right, boys.
[28:06.420 --> 28:07.020]  Let's go.
[28:07.100 --> 28:09.220]  That was... that was so cool.
[28:11.560 --> 28:12.680]  What is an Akula?
[28:13.560 --> 28:15.120]  I think it's a stealth helicopter.
[28:15.360 --> 28:15.440]  Yeah.
[28:15.600 --> 28:16.460]  Oh, hell yeah.
[28:16.500 --> 28:17.980]  Okay, I just... I laid down a little...
[28:17.980 --> 28:18.720]  I mean, it doesn't matter, right?
[28:18.800 --> 28:19.320]  Oh, dear.
[28:20.140 --> 28:20.820]  No offense there.
[28:23.400 --> 28:26.620]  We got such cool shots of you guys going in,
[28:26.800 --> 28:28.100]  like Andrew going up or whatever,
[28:28.360 --> 28:30.660]  and then Nick just getting fucked in that room.
[28:31.280 --> 28:31.720]  Yeah.
[28:32.400 --> 28:33.940]  I had to shoot that guy to death.
[28:34.020 --> 28:36.540]  And there was a woman in there who probably didn't need to, but...
[28:36.540 --> 28:37.260]  Oh, a civilian woman?
[28:37.740 --> 28:38.900]  Hey, what's going on?
[28:38.920 --> 28:40.360]  Well, she was a witness.
[28:40.700 --> 28:42.600]  I take it this isn't purely a social call.
[28:42.880 --> 28:43.560]  Of course not.
[28:43.780 --> 28:45.260]  You're in trouble and you need my help.
[28:45.480 --> 28:46.020]  No problem.
[28:46.900 --> 28:47.480]  Oh, is it in the...
[28:47.480 --> 28:48.200]  We gotta be almost there.
[28:48.400 --> 28:48.960]  Who's jumping out?
[28:48.960 --> 28:49.860]  Who's jumping out to take it?
[28:50.300 --> 28:50.660]  Hello?
[28:51.120 --> 28:52.180]  Is it in the hangar or behind it?
[28:52.220 --> 28:52.340]  Okay.
[28:53.160 --> 28:53.880]  I think it's behind it.
[28:54.020 --> 28:54.420]  It's in the hangar.
[28:54.420 --> 28:54.960]  There it is.
[28:55.000 --> 28:55.580]  Oh, it's behind it.
[28:55.640 --> 28:56.040]  I got it.
[28:56.740 --> 28:57.100]  Okay.
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.140]  All right.
[28:58.220 --> 28:59.520]  Nick might not have it.
[29:00.520 --> 29:01.160]  Let's get out.
[29:02.940 --> 29:04.220]  Oh, there are people.
[29:04.540 --> 29:05.420]  There are people.
[29:08.760 --> 29:09.640]  I'm getting it.
[29:09.740 --> 29:10.420]  Oh, God.
[29:10.900 --> 29:11.840]  No, Gavin.
[29:11.840 --> 29:13.720]  Abner is totally annihilated.
[29:14.240 --> 29:14.960]  Go, Gavin, go.
[29:15.100 --> 29:15.980]  Go, Gavin, go.
[29:16.220 --> 29:17.340]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:17.360 --> 29:18.280]  There's only two seats.
[29:18.420 --> 29:18.560]  Bye.
[29:18.860 --> 29:19.180]  No, there's not.
[29:19.600 --> 29:20.240]  Oh, maybe not.
[29:20.340 --> 29:20.780]  What the fuck?
[29:21.300 --> 29:22.260]  There's more than two seats.
[29:22.440 --> 29:23.120]  Go, go.
[29:23.260 --> 29:23.940]  Andrew, where are you at?
[29:24.040 --> 29:24.340]  Where are you going?
[29:24.340 --> 29:24.780]  Come on, Andrew.
[29:25.000 --> 29:25.360]  So, Andrew.
[29:25.620 --> 29:27.600]  I thought I was told there was only two seats.
[29:27.600 --> 29:27.680]  Come on, Andrew.
[29:27.820 --> 29:28.480]  Come on.
[29:30.240 --> 29:30.960]  I'm trying.
[29:32.560 --> 29:35.920]  Oh, look at the line of cock.
[29:36.020 --> 29:37.260]  Let me in.
[29:37.540 --> 29:38.700]  Let me in.
[29:38.960 --> 29:39.600]  Let him in.
[29:41.060 --> 29:42.480]  Die, you mothers.
[29:44.520 --> 29:50.040]  Oh, this is going to be so dizzying.
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.580]  Do not cut into my perspective.
[29:52.780 --> 29:53.080]  All right.
[29:53.540 --> 29:54.360]  I'm going to go stealth.
[29:54.440 --> 29:55.080]  Let's go dark.
[29:55.300 --> 29:56.340]  How do I turn it dark?
[29:57.520 --> 29:57.940]  Oh, my God.
[29:58.260 --> 29:59.620]  You turn into the plane.
[30:03.080 --> 30:04.380]  I'm calling Lester.
[30:06.300 --> 30:07.700]  Press Y to activate stealth.
[30:09.360 --> 30:10.760]  Oh, won't let me remove them.
[30:11.380 --> 30:12.740]  Hey, guess where we have to fly now?
[30:13.180 --> 30:14.540]  Is it all the way back up there?
[30:14.620 --> 30:15.040]  You're shit.
[30:15.420 --> 30:15.460]  Yeah.
[30:16.020 --> 30:17.060]  Oh, my God.
[30:20.660 --> 30:22.300]  Well, at least you can go across the lake.
[30:22.500 --> 30:24.180]  As the bird flies or whatever.
[30:24.980 --> 30:26.500]  As, you know, as the bird flies.
[30:28.420 --> 30:30.960]  Do I fly through, like, one of these floors of construction?
[30:32.500 --> 30:32.900]  No.
[30:33.620 --> 30:34.280]  Oh, OK.
[30:36.120 --> 30:36.920]  Oh, yes.
[30:37.100 --> 30:37.620]  What the hell?
[30:37.680 --> 30:38.200]  I said, yeah.
[30:38.580 --> 30:38.820]  Yeah.
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.440]  We yeah, we don't listen to that.
[30:40.540 --> 30:41.500]  This is not the reverse.
[30:41.780 --> 30:41.820]  Sorry.
[30:42.020 --> 30:43.260]  This does listen.
[30:43.480 --> 30:46.400]  No, we also figured out we fight.
[30:46.500 --> 30:48.460]  We figured out that Nick's thing isn't peer pressure.
[30:48.560 --> 30:49.360]  It's peer permission.
[30:49.700 --> 30:52.400]  It's he wants to do it.
[30:52.420 --> 30:54.620]  And he just needs to hear yes from someone else.
[30:54.780 --> 30:54.920]  Yeah.
[30:54.980 --> 30:57.360]  Nick is always thinking he just needs the green light.
[30:58.120 --> 30:58.340]  Yeah.
[30:58.440 --> 30:58.720]  Yeah.
[30:58.720 --> 30:58.840]  Yeah.
[30:58.840 --> 31:01.380]  So it's just we figured out it's pure permission.
[31:03.300 --> 31:03.580]  Yeah.
[31:03.900 --> 31:04.340]  And go through the.
[31:05.660 --> 31:06.800]  Hey, don't listen to Nick.
[31:07.020 --> 31:08.460]  Go to where we need to go so we don't have to.
[31:08.580 --> 31:09.420]  OK, can we take a vote?
[31:09.640 --> 31:10.200]  One less one?
[31:10.260 --> 31:10.380]  Yes.
[31:10.420 --> 31:10.560]  One.
[31:10.660 --> 31:10.800]  No.
[31:11.280 --> 31:11.400]  D.
[31:11.540 --> 31:12.160]  Go to the D.
[31:12.340 --> 31:12.600]  The D.
[31:13.360 --> 31:14.540]  There's two no's and one yes.
[31:15.240 --> 31:15.380]  Out.
[31:15.500 --> 31:16.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:17.800 --> 31:18.080]  Jeez.
[31:18.640 --> 31:19.440]  What if you vote?
[31:20.120 --> 31:20.400]  Ooh.
[31:23.240 --> 31:23.700]  You know what?
[31:23.740 --> 31:24.200]  I want to play a game.
[31:25.680 --> 31:26.260]  Yeah, you're going to.
[31:26.400 --> 31:27.240]  Oh, what?
[31:27.980 --> 31:28.940]  Oh, my God.
[31:32.390 --> 31:36.430]  I was thinking about doing the same, and I'm really glad I didn't look at how far back you are.
[31:36.570 --> 31:37.670]  Oh, my God.
[31:37.810 --> 31:38.670]  Go, pull up!
[31:38.850 --> 31:39.810]  What are you doing?
[31:39.970 --> 31:42.650]  Shit, we came in, we cooked, we came in hot.
[31:43.630 --> 31:46.210]  You said that like you didn't fully control it.
[31:46.210 --> 31:46.650]  Why did you do that?
[31:46.910 --> 31:50.070]  Well, I started pulling up, but it was we were too much of a dive.
[31:51.070 --> 31:52.390]  This is a rugged thing.
[31:54.790 --> 31:56.090]  Whoops, whoops.
[31:56.270 --> 31:57.010]  Did we do it?
[31:57.110 --> 31:58.070]  No, I got to deliver it.
[31:58.130 --> 31:58.390]  There we go.
[31:59.210 --> 31:59.890]  Oh, there it goes.
[32:01.370 --> 32:04.930]  I wish I could bail out of it in the cutscenes, and I'd have to start down the hole.
[32:06.490 --> 32:07.850]  Ooh, get me in.
[32:09.710 --> 32:10.790]  Hey, look, look at this.
[32:11.010 --> 32:11.490]  Eric, look up.
[32:12.230 --> 32:12.850]  Check this out.
[32:14.270 --> 32:17.780]  What was that?
[32:19.120 --> 32:20.040]  What happened there?
[32:20.440 --> 32:23.280]  Nick was parachuting in, and I shot him with a firework.
[32:24.600 --> 32:27.400]  Right as I got sucked down.
[32:27.500 --> 32:29.960]  Right as I got sucked down into the prep area.
[32:33.740 --> 32:34.900]  Oh, dude.
[32:35.000 --> 32:35.740]  That was awesome.
[32:35.920 --> 32:36.900]  Oh, my God.
[32:37.120 --> 32:38.760]  All right, what are we doing, boys?
[32:40.000 --> 32:40.760]  Well, we're...
[32:40.760 --> 32:40.840]  Stealing.
[32:41.080 --> 32:42.320]  Going to a morgue and...
[32:43.540 --> 32:44.800]  Stealing a helicopter or something?
[32:44.880 --> 32:45.260]  I don't know.
[32:45.900 --> 32:47.500]  Ready in Italian, apparently.
[32:49.420 --> 32:49.900]  Italian.
[32:50.760 --> 32:51.160]  Okay.
[32:51.560 --> 32:53.600]  What the fuck outfits are you wearing?
[32:54.840 --> 32:56.180]  Fucking cool-ass outfits.
[32:56.280 --> 32:57.340]  The snow camo is a great touch.
[32:59.060 --> 32:59.700]  Thank you.
[32:59.800 --> 33:00.640]  That's very smart.
[33:01.720 --> 33:02.380]  You know what?
[33:02.580 --> 33:03.520]  I planned ahead.
[33:03.740 --> 33:04.620]  Yeah, that's what happened.
[33:04.800 --> 33:05.600]  I think I'm wearing a snowman outfit.
[33:07.100 --> 33:09.200]  He just stops, and everyone thinks that's where he goes.
[33:10.160 --> 33:11.180]  Where are the cars?
[33:12.120 --> 33:13.180]  How am I holding a shotgun?
[33:13.200 --> 33:14.080]  Where are the cars?
[33:14.920 --> 33:15.820]  Oh, they're way up on the road.
[33:15.820 --> 33:16.280]  Oh, here we go.
[33:17.240 --> 33:17.580]  Ambulance.
[33:17.780 --> 33:18.580]  Gavin, you want to drive?
[33:18.600 --> 33:18.980]  You want me to?
[33:19.760 --> 33:20.580]  Here, we'll take...
[33:21.020 --> 33:21.580]  You guys.
[33:22.380 --> 33:23.440]  Okay, I'll get in the back.
[33:23.700 --> 33:24.520]  If I roll it, you can drive.
[33:25.620 --> 33:26.540]  Yeah, sounds good.
[33:27.420 --> 33:28.440]  All right, I'll meet you there, Andrew.
[33:28.660 --> 33:28.880]  Okay.
[33:31.080 --> 33:31.800]  Nino, nino.
[33:31.980 --> 33:32.500]  Oh, boy.
[33:33.520 --> 33:34.160]  Oh, boy.
[33:37.020 --> 33:37.740]  Nino, nino.
[33:39.220 --> 33:40.060]  Nick's still Italian.
[33:40.360 --> 33:41.540]  Oh, my God.
[33:41.880 --> 33:42.800]  Oh, no, he's under a light.
[33:43.700 --> 33:44.280]  There you go.
[33:44.360 --> 33:45.140]  Do you need an ambulance?
[33:45.420 --> 33:45.780]  Hey, thanks.
[33:48.200 --> 33:49.060]  I'll clear the path.
[33:51.900 --> 33:52.900]  And I'll help.
[33:53.720 --> 33:54.440]  Yeah, yeah, you're...
[33:54.440 --> 33:54.960]  Oh, God, Gavin!
[33:55.280 --> 33:56.060]  ...being very helpful.
[33:56.300 --> 33:58.080]  I like that the sirens are on already, because I think...
[33:58.460 --> 34:00.340]  Canonically, this is like a five-hour drive.
[34:03.580 --> 34:04.960]  How you guys doing over there?
[34:05.640 --> 34:07.100]  I'm waiting at the scout point.
[34:08.160 --> 34:10.220]  Yeah, my line disappeared when you got there.
[34:11.220 --> 34:12.920]  We are almost there.
[34:13.300 --> 34:13.580]  I'm here.
[34:15.080 --> 34:18.060]  Okay, three, four blocks up, and then left.
[34:19.860 --> 34:21.520]  All right, Eric, you're gonna have to get out on this turn, then.
[34:21.700 --> 34:22.640]  Okay, on this turn?
[34:22.640 --> 34:24.600]  What do we need for the whole time to get closer?
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.160]  Oh, we're just stealing the chopper.
[34:26.280 --> 34:26.300]  Ah!
[34:28.620 --> 34:29.780]  It didn't... it didn't work.
[34:29.840 --> 34:30.040]  Stop!
[34:30.700 --> 34:31.360]  Oh, sorry.
[34:32.880 --> 34:33.900]  Why does it look like...
[34:33.900 --> 34:34.120]  All right.
[34:34.280 --> 34:35.600]  ...we are so out of place here?
[34:36.660 --> 34:37.880]  Yeah, it really does.
[34:38.860 --> 34:39.720]  Don't pull out a weapon.
[34:40.000 --> 34:40.540]  This is not good stuff.
[34:40.820 --> 34:41.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:43.140 --> 34:43.940]  There's the chopper.
[34:45.380 --> 34:47.040]  Oh, follow! We gotta follow the helicopter.
[34:47.340 --> 34:47.800]  Oh, shit!
[34:50.840 --> 34:52.600]  Well, if there's two of us, they can't get away.
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.990]  Hey, what's up? We're paramedics.
[35:00.990 --> 35:02.330]  We're being regular.
[35:03.410 --> 35:04.430]  All right, here we go.
[35:07.930 --> 35:11.370]  We're walking in, being normal paramedics, going inside the facility.
[35:12.310 --> 35:14.170]  We're following a helicopter in the sky.
[35:15.090 --> 35:16.550]  Yo, where the corpse is at?
[35:18.590 --> 35:19.770]  Oh, boy, that didn't help.
[35:19.770 --> 35:21.090]  This is how they talk. I've seen ER.
[35:22.870 --> 35:23.990]  I've seen Casualty.
[35:25.670 --> 35:26.210]  Casualty!
[35:27.670 --> 35:28.210]  Casualty!
[35:29.950 --> 35:30.490]  Casualty!
[35:31.830 --> 35:32.370]  Casualty!
[35:33.330 --> 35:35.130]  All right, I'm gonna finger this one. You finger the other.
[35:35.350 --> 35:36.010]  Yep. All right.
[35:36.270 --> 35:36.590]  Dig deep.
[35:38.490 --> 35:38.510]  No.
[35:38.770 --> 35:39.250]  Search in the mouth.
[35:40.130 --> 35:41.490]  I searched that one's chest.
[35:42.090 --> 35:43.470]  Are you guys actually digging into corpses?
[35:43.770 --> 35:45.290]  Uh, I'm just patting the tits.
[35:45.650 --> 35:46.250]  Patting them down.
[35:46.690 --> 35:48.150]  He's just recreating that voice, too.
[35:48.370 --> 35:48.750]  Nothing in there.
[35:52.870 --> 35:55.350]  All right, one more time.
[35:55.730 --> 35:58.630]  I swear, if we have to follow that chopper again...
[35:59.430 --> 36:00.870]  Oh, no, what if we go back to the bunker?
[36:01.730 --> 36:03.790]  Well, luckily, the bunker's really close, right?
[36:04.030 --> 36:05.050]  I'm turning off my Xbox.
[36:05.730 --> 36:07.690]  Andrew got a really close bunker, so he should be fine.
[36:08.650 --> 36:09.990]  Restart at checkpoint, it says.
[36:10.390 --> 36:11.730]  Oh, good. That's right here.
[36:11.930 --> 36:13.390]  Where's the check?
[36:13.670 --> 36:15.510]  Check, check, point, point.
[36:16.270 --> 36:19.050]  It better be here or kill Andrew.
[36:19.570 --> 36:20.970]  Whoa, you guys know about Casualty, too?
[36:22.090 --> 36:23.110]  There's a second one?
[36:25.110 --> 36:25.990]  Oh, perfect.
[36:26.430 --> 36:27.330]  Nice, easy.
[36:27.570 --> 36:28.130]  Right next to it.
[36:29.110 --> 36:30.350]  Look at that. We're already inside.
[36:33.690 --> 36:34.450]  All right, Andrew.
[36:34.730 --> 36:34.930]  Yep.
[36:35.770 --> 36:36.930]  We're gonna, we're gonna live.
[36:37.170 --> 36:37.390]  Yep.
[36:37.870 --> 36:38.070]  Yep.
[36:38.350 --> 36:39.930]  Honestly, forgot what we're doing for a minute.
[36:40.050 --> 36:41.050]  I just ran right in there.
[36:41.330 --> 36:42.310]  Pretty cool, we had lives.
[36:42.670 --> 36:43.710]  Wow, those guys have guns.
[36:45.890 --> 36:47.570]  Wow, we don't lose any progress at all.
[36:47.570 --> 36:49.730]  No, no, we are exactly where we need to be.
[36:50.790 --> 36:51.390]  That's perfect.
[36:51.690 --> 36:53.010]  Oh, what's up?
[36:53.830 --> 36:55.010]  I was just seeing what was in that room.
[36:55.330 --> 36:55.930]  Anything cool?
[36:57.330 --> 36:57.930]  That guy.
[37:01.630 --> 37:03.610]  Oh, we lost our criminal mastermind.
[37:03.890 --> 37:04.770]  Ah, shit.
[37:04.890 --> 37:05.610]  Ah, that was a challenge.
[37:06.190 --> 37:07.050]  What does that mean?
[37:07.470 --> 37:10.990]  It means Andrew died and we, we failed Krimmy.
[37:11.190 --> 37:14.910]  Oh, Christ, I'm getting lit up.
[37:18.850 --> 37:19.250]  Snag.
[37:19.750 --> 37:20.870]  We have to keep going up.
[37:22.330 --> 37:23.570]  Oh, we can't go up this way?
[37:23.570 --> 37:24.470]  Why would you switch to a snowball?
[37:24.550 --> 37:25.710]  Can we? Nope.
[37:30.020 --> 37:31.200]  X-ray, is there?
[37:33.860 --> 37:37.040]  I wonder if they fix criminal masterminds on Doomsday.
[37:37.060 --> 37:38.040]  It might be doable, though.
[37:39.020 --> 37:39.500]  What is that?
[37:39.960 --> 37:40.260]  What do you mean?
[37:41.020 --> 37:44.680]  You have to beat every heist and prep and set up without dying.
[37:45.280 --> 37:46.920]  Are these guys gonna shoot me in the face?
[37:47.260 --> 37:47.460]  Maybe.
[37:48.760 --> 37:49.140]  No!
[37:49.360 --> 37:50.040]  I got punched!
[37:50.500 --> 37:50.980]  Right hook!
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.920]  Take that in the chin, son!
[37:53.180 --> 37:53.640]  I'm gonna die.
[37:56.100 --> 37:57.720]  I'll take that in the chin, son, I'm gonna die.
[37:58.520 --> 38:00.740]  Did I punch these people to death or did you shoot them?
[38:00.740 --> 38:01.940]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.660]  There are a lot of guys with guns in here.
[38:04.940 --> 38:05.360]  A lot!
[38:06.940 --> 38:07.260]  No!
[38:08.180 --> 38:12.960]  Wow, I saw one red circle and I guess I just, I didn't totally gloss over the rest.
[38:13.100 --> 38:13.700]  Holy shit.
[38:14.700 --> 38:15.520]  All right, I'm getting a gun out.
[38:15.980 --> 38:17.280]  Yeah, let's do it.
[38:21.740 --> 38:22.100]  Oops!
[38:30.020 --> 38:31.140]  How did you die?
[38:31.220 --> 38:31.840]  What happened?
[38:32.600 --> 38:36.780]  Well, I grenade launched it up the stairs, it hit the wall above him, bounced back down the stairs.
[38:36.780 --> 38:38.240]  Why did you throw a grenade?
[38:39.860 --> 38:40.540]  What do you mean?
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.080]  He was tired of running up the stairs.
[38:43.780 --> 38:45.540]  So he blew himself up the stairs instead.
[38:46.100 --> 38:47.100]  You get shot, you'll be fine.
[38:48.120 --> 38:48.480]  Okay.
[38:51.220 --> 38:52.180]  Or a musket.
[38:54.920 --> 38:55.460]  Wait, what?
[38:55.500 --> 38:56.800]  You went for the silenced bip, huh?
[38:56.940 --> 38:57.820]  That was pretty good, actually.
[38:58.340 --> 38:58.500]  Yeah.
[38:59.760 --> 39:02.040]  Wow, I thought, I thought silenced bip was the move.
[39:02.120 --> 39:03.080]  It is not the move.
[39:04.980 --> 39:06.180]  You wanna take one side, I'll take the other?
[39:06.780 --> 39:07.840]  Blind fire, blind fire!
[39:10.980 --> 39:11.900]  Where are these other guys?
[39:12.220 --> 39:12.660]  Where are they?
[39:19.960 --> 39:20.580]  Do you see them?
[39:21.700 --> 39:24.060]  There's a guy back there, I'm gonna throw a grenade under that.
[39:24.340 --> 39:25.280]  All right, good move.
[39:25.780 --> 39:26.140]  Nice!
[39:27.380 --> 39:28.460]  Didn't coax him out, huh?
[39:29.320 --> 39:29.920]  What about that?
[39:30.520 --> 39:31.540]  Are they guys coming up the stairs?
[39:32.140 --> 39:33.400]  No, no, we're good.
[39:33.940 --> 39:34.960]  All right, let's make a move in.
[39:35.880 --> 39:37.180]  Let's go in and right.
[39:38.100 --> 39:38.460]  Okay.
[39:39.700 --> 39:40.820]  Guy here, got him.
[39:43.660 --> 39:44.900]  Oh, the music's banging!
[39:45.120 --> 39:46.020]  Yeah, the music's pretty cool.
[39:48.960 --> 39:49.600]  Andrew, no!
[39:49.880 --> 39:50.380]  No, Andrew!
[39:50.780 --> 39:51.140]  What do you mean?
[39:51.900 --> 39:52.420]  Are they in here?
[39:52.760 --> 39:53.380]  Pre-pilot, you need pre-pilot.
[39:54.660 --> 39:55.380]  Okay, okay.
[39:55.440 --> 39:55.840]  Are they coming up the stairs?
[39:55.840 --> 39:56.760]  No, no, it's fine, no, no, no, no.
[39:56.760 --> 39:59.120]  I mean, I'm downloading the...
[39:59.120 --> 40:00.480]  I'm trying to download the data here, hang on.
[40:00.820 --> 40:01.600]  All right, I've got the stairs.
[40:02.220 --> 40:03.120]  Okay, downloading data.
[40:04.080 --> 40:04.720]  Poor Andrew.
[40:08.600 --> 40:09.280]  Downloading data.
[40:09.600 --> 40:10.140]  I'm shooting it.
[40:10.520 --> 40:10.700]  Yep.
[40:12.180 --> 40:13.020]  Download progress...
[40:15.320 --> 40:15.740]  99...
[40:15.740 --> 40:16.680]  Download complete?
[40:17.500 --> 40:18.700]  I think we may have some action.
[40:19.120 --> 40:19.540]  Okay.
[40:19.720 --> 40:20.120]  Boosh!
[40:21.620 --> 40:22.240]  How we looking?
[40:22.400 --> 40:23.860]  I think I shot some sort of conduit box.
[40:25.740 --> 40:27.380]  Oh, we gotta go back down now?
[40:27.740 --> 40:28.540]  Yeah, we do.
[40:29.160 --> 40:30.400]  Shit, fuck me.
[40:30.600 --> 40:31.420]  That's okay, we got you covered.
[40:32.080 --> 40:34.700]  Make sure you're, uh, make sure you're eating snacks and shit.
[40:35.660 --> 40:36.360]  Yeah, yeah, big time.
[40:36.360 --> 40:37.000]  Take that shit!
[40:40.770 --> 40:41.130]  Holy...
[40:41.130 --> 40:44.610]  He said that like he was agreeing, but in a tone that sounded like he wasn't.
[40:45.310 --> 40:48.090]  Am I going to the roof or the ground floor?
[40:48.350 --> 40:49.090]  I kinda hate this guy.
[40:49.330 --> 40:49.650]  What do you mean?
[40:50.330 --> 40:51.290]  Just... let's go down.
[40:52.270 --> 40:52.510]  Okay.
[40:53.170 --> 40:54.630]  Okay, well, we're picking them up.
[40:55.030 --> 40:56.450]  Yeah, well, I'm asking...
[40:56.450 --> 40:56.850]  Are you?
[40:57.510 --> 41:00.490]  Not the roof, go to the, uh, stairs in front.
[41:00.590 --> 41:01.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
[41:01.670 --> 41:01.970]  I misunderstood.
[41:01.970 --> 41:03.150]  God damn, that guy had a lot of...
[41:03.150 --> 41:03.490]  Shortcut!
[41:04.770 --> 41:05.810]  Where do you do it?
[41:05.850 --> 41:06.490]  Gavin, no!
[41:07.190 --> 41:07.550]  What?
[41:08.590 --> 41:09.050]  Shortcut!
[41:13.800 --> 41:14.320]  Boosh!
[41:17.880 --> 41:19.480]  How is he still alive?
[41:21.200 --> 41:22.080]  Okay, there we go.
[41:22.240 --> 41:22.460]  All right.
[41:22.900 --> 41:24.220]  We're inconspicuous.
[41:25.180 --> 41:26.460]  Ain't nobody gonna see nothing.
[41:26.960 --> 41:27.240]  Nope.
[41:27.960 --> 41:28.500]  No witnesses.
[41:29.560 --> 41:31.020]  Sneaky stealth helicopter.
[41:32.240 --> 41:32.500]  Okay.
[41:33.860 --> 41:34.860]  Anyone behind us?
[41:34.920 --> 41:35.120]  No.
[41:35.300 --> 41:36.040]  All right, let's keep moving.
[41:38.120 --> 41:39.140]  Guy in the... you got him?
[41:39.940 --> 41:40.320]  Musket!
[41:40.660 --> 41:40.920]  Okay.
[41:41.320 --> 41:43.220]  Gavin is using a musket.
[41:44.280 --> 41:44.980]  Single shot?
[41:45.300 --> 41:46.700]  Yeah, that's a musket.
[41:46.840 --> 41:47.320]  And then I have to...
[41:47.320 --> 41:48.960]  Then I have to put the powder in it every time.
[41:49.360 --> 41:49.520]  Yep.
[41:49.800 --> 41:50.400]  Oh, shit!
[41:51.260 --> 41:52.480]  Sounds, uh, convenient.
[41:53.100 --> 41:54.140]  You shot that guy in the anus.
[41:54.660 --> 41:54.900]  Yep.
[41:56.040 --> 41:57.380]  He took a lot of my health.
[41:57.740 --> 41:58.620]  That was bad.
[41:59.340 --> 41:59.720]  Oh.
[41:59.840 --> 42:00.340]  You going to help?
[42:00.600 --> 42:00.880]  Musket!
[42:02.840 --> 42:03.720]  You know what?
[42:03.800 --> 42:04.740]  I think we gotta keep moving up.
[42:05.600 --> 42:05.920]  Yep.
[42:06.200 --> 42:06.440]  Up?
[42:07.240 --> 42:08.020]  Oh, no, no, no.
[42:08.060 --> 42:08.160]  Where?
[42:08.300 --> 42:09.060]  Just forward.
[42:09.260 --> 42:09.480]  Forward.
[42:11.980 --> 42:12.700]  Oh, shit!
[42:12.980 --> 42:13.380]  Fuck me!
[42:13.920 --> 42:15.060]  Well, Gavin, you haven't tried.
[42:16.460 --> 42:21.620]  Yeah, I think the interior of that building is a lot larger than it looks from the outside for us.
[42:22.440 --> 42:24.180]  Well, a lot of it's underground, I think.
[42:24.500 --> 42:26.020]  Oh my god, I almost died.
[42:26.680 --> 42:27.600]  That's where they keep the bodies.
[42:27.760 --> 42:29.020]  It's naturally cool under the earth.
[42:29.360 --> 42:30.280]  Ah, makes sense.
[42:33.220 --> 42:34.680]  Snacks and armor, snacks and armor.
[42:35.220 --> 42:35.320]  Cool.
[42:36.140 --> 42:38.360]  All right, there should be only like one more guy in here, I think.
[42:39.640 --> 42:40.660]  I'm gonna move up a little bit.
[42:40.980 --> 42:42.360]  Oh, it's a chili house.
[42:42.500 --> 42:42.900]  Yeah, I see him.
[42:43.340 --> 42:43.920]  Oh, shit.
[42:44.120 --> 42:45.280]  Oh my god!
[42:46.080 --> 42:46.620]  You all right?
[42:46.980 --> 42:48.020]  Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.
[42:48.480 --> 42:49.080]  I think we're good.
[42:50.980 --> 42:52.320]  All right, we're out, we're out.
[42:53.040 --> 42:56.140]  Wow, this desk is confounded.
[42:56.300 --> 42:57.480]  Oh god, please get in.
[42:57.540 --> 42:58.160]  Yep, yep, yep.
[42:58.640 --> 42:59.680]  Oh god, please hurry.
[43:00.000 --> 43:00.360]  Yep, yep, yep.
[43:01.340 --> 43:02.120]  We're coming, we're coming.
[43:02.280 --> 43:02.340]  Oh, let's go.
[43:04.480 --> 43:05.120]  Oh god!
[43:05.900 --> 43:06.860]  All right, let's take the ambulance.
[43:07.820 --> 43:09.460]  Kill that guy, kill that guy, kill that guy!
[43:09.560 --> 43:10.020]  Gavin, no!
[43:10.700 --> 43:12.840]  Guys, they're alive, kill them!
[43:13.160 --> 43:13.760]  Get in.
[43:14.740 --> 43:16.140]  Andrew, Gavin!
[43:16.760 --> 43:18.080]  I'm shooting, I'm shooting.
[43:18.440 --> 43:18.900]  No, no!
[43:19.160 --> 43:19.540]  Oh, I'm in.
[43:20.440 --> 43:21.380]  Take off, go!
[43:21.480 --> 43:23.220]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[43:23.260 --> 43:24.060]  Ah, stop her!
[43:24.600 --> 43:27.860]  Who let Nick fly?
[43:28.300 --> 43:29.020]  Dude, no kidding.
[43:29.020 --> 43:29.480]  He always flies.
[43:29.720 --> 43:30.760]  I'm the pilot, fellas!
[43:31.320 --> 43:31.920]  Oh, that's right.
[43:32.120 --> 43:32.640]  Oh god.
[43:33.480 --> 43:34.620]  All right, what have I got?
[43:36.020 --> 43:38.080]  Oh god, that sounds promising.
[43:38.480 --> 43:42.400]  I'm going to try to get a kill with a shotgun from up here.
[43:43.200 --> 43:45.220]  Am I taking this where we think we're taking this?
[43:46.040 --> 43:49.200]  Uh, no, not quite.
[43:49.420 --> 43:50.080]  Nope, nope, nope.
[43:50.200 --> 43:52.160]  It's almost there, it's just keep going north.
[43:52.740 --> 43:53.280]  Got it.
[43:56.520 --> 43:57.960]  Did you guys have fun at the mortuary?
[43:58.760 --> 43:59.840]  Uh, yeah, we had a great time.
[44:00.240 --> 44:00.920]  Were the bodies cool?
[44:01.680 --> 44:03.640]  Uh, no, we only saw three bodies.
[44:04.120 --> 44:04.640]  Any ghosts?
[44:04.660 --> 44:04.780]  Aw, man.
[44:05.340 --> 44:06.260]  Not a single ghost.
[44:06.760 --> 44:08.060]  To be fair, we made it through.
[44:08.060 --> 44:08.980]  We made a lot of new bodies.
[44:09.360 --> 44:10.740]  Yeah, we made a lot of ghosts.
[44:11.260 --> 44:13.120]  Oh, well, business is booming, I guess.
[44:13.320 --> 44:14.680]  Oh, on the right, chopper.
[44:15.360 --> 44:15.780]  Oh, yeah.
[44:17.520 --> 44:19.560]  Who's... is someone operating the guns in this thing?
[44:19.900 --> 44:20.260]  Yeah.
[44:21.560 --> 44:24.140]  Yeah, you can press Y to use the rocket launcher.
[44:24.600 --> 44:24.920]  Yeah.
[44:26.880 --> 44:27.740]  All right, nice try.
[44:30.180 --> 44:32.060]  We have to, uh, we have to lose the cops.
[44:32.180 --> 44:33.560]  So if there's like a helicopter or something, we gotta...
[44:33.560 --> 44:34.140]  Oh, there you go.
[44:35.660 --> 44:40.140]  Yeah, I mean, you know, their window of looking is pretty small and stupid.
[44:40.860 --> 44:42.080]  Small and stupid.
[44:42.980 --> 44:44.040]  Fucking showed them.
[44:44.680 --> 44:45.560]  Yeah, fucking idiot.
[44:53.640 --> 44:55.800]  Jesus, you almost hit me.
[44:56.220 --> 44:58.420]  Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, Nick, yeah, Nick.
[44:59.480 --> 45:01.780]  Yeah, my bad.
[45:04.400 --> 45:05.320]  Oh, you almost hit me.
[45:07.280 --> 45:08.540]  I'm not Mickey Mouse.
[45:20.730 --> 45:21.510]  Like a glove.
[45:21.670 --> 45:22.250]  Oh, nice landing.
[45:26.010 --> 45:26.330]  Pissed.
[45:28.090 --> 45:29.150]  Well, that seems unfair.
[45:29.690 --> 45:30.010]  Interesting.
[45:31.810 --> 45:32.670]  Interesting, platinum.
[45:32.830 --> 45:34.570]  No, you get enough shots out of it, I guess you can get platinum.
[45:35.150 --> 45:37.510]  Yeah, it's like we had the same amount of shots, huh?
[45:38.310 --> 45:38.750]  15 JP.
[45:38.750 --> 45:39.430]  Well, you put it that way.
[45:41.930 --> 45:43.650]  Guys, I'm level 39.
[45:44.150 --> 45:45.770]  Wow, I'm level 39.
[45:46.670 --> 45:47.690]  You're almost 40.
[45:48.110 --> 45:49.290]  Almost nearly, guys.
[45:49.330 --> 45:51.390]  I'm so close to level 40, level 39.
[45:51.570 --> 45:52.810]  What a way to end this video.
