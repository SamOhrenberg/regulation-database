[00:00.000 --> 00:02.260]  What are we? So what is this? We're doing another heist?
[00:02.960 --> 00:04.180]  We're doing another heist.
[00:04.540 --> 00:05.720]  I don't know why you're confused.
[00:06.480 --> 00:07.300]  We're launching it.
[00:07.340 --> 00:09.540]  I thought maybe you'd tell me what the heist was about or something.
[00:09.680 --> 00:10.280]  No, we'll find out.
[00:10.400 --> 00:13.300]  Oh, well, that's what the guy does that you say, shut up.
[00:13.460 --> 00:16.380]  I was kind of like setting you up to like sort of give a lay of the land.
[00:16.420 --> 00:17.380]  You don't like the setup guy.
[00:17.520 --> 00:20.920]  Why would I set you up the entire time? Because you can do it faster than the guy who...
[00:20.920 --> 00:21.360]  Oh, man.
[00:21.940 --> 00:24.520]  Get into the Humane Labs raid and do a bunch of stuff.
[00:24.920 --> 00:26.280]  Do some humane things in the Humane Labs.
[00:26.280 --> 00:28.060]  Wait, isn't this how the rage virus got released?
[00:30.040 --> 00:31.960]  Yes, it's this fucking guy again.
[00:32.060 --> 00:34.580]  Right. Yeah, it's always this guy.
[00:35.020 --> 00:35.980]  He's the heist guy.
[00:36.240 --> 00:37.180]  I don't think that's true.
[00:37.860 --> 00:39.420]  So there's this. I mean, he is.
[00:39.820 --> 00:40.520]  For these heists.
[00:41.060 --> 00:42.240]  Doesn't Lester give us a heist?
[00:42.500 --> 00:43.460]  He's not always there.
[00:44.180 --> 00:45.980]  But he just he organizes it.
[00:45.980 --> 00:48.360]  A few years ago, he was leased to a schedule company running.
[00:48.460 --> 00:50.480]  I'm trying. Oh, there we go.
[00:50.600 --> 00:52.000]  Well, I thought you wanted the exposition.
[00:52.180 --> 00:53.160]  I wanted it from you.
[00:55.760 --> 00:56.640]  Decodes, insurgents.
[00:58.060 --> 00:59.180]  Oh, we have to do all of them, right?
[00:59.240 --> 01:00.320]  So it doesn't matter. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00.380 --> 01:01.480]  Let's just start with decodes. Yeah.
[01:04.760 --> 01:05.660]  Oh, my God.
[01:05.820 --> 01:07.040]  Who's this green faced man?
[01:07.240 --> 01:10.740]  Me. If it wouldn't let me wear a rat mask, I had to do something else.
[01:11.080 --> 01:13.020]  Yeah. I don't think I've seen your face until just now.
[01:13.400 --> 01:15.420]  All right. I'm going to drive my inconspicuous vehicle.
[01:15.940 --> 01:18.220]  I'm going to ride with you because I think we're supposed to go.
[01:18.340 --> 01:19.920]  I think me and you are together. There we go.
[01:21.600 --> 01:22.900]  Drive me to my destination.
[01:23.080 --> 01:23.780]  See you all over there.
[01:24.760 --> 01:25.340]  Let's go.
[01:25.340 --> 01:30.420]  Oh, you guys, you fucking idiots.
[01:30.680 --> 01:32.140]  No bad idea. No bad ideas.
[01:33.460 --> 01:35.300]  Oh, no, this is like an Uber ride.
[01:35.420 --> 01:37.300]  Ready, Gavin? Hey, what's up?
[01:38.420 --> 01:39.060]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:39.940 --> 01:40.660]  I asked you first.
[01:41.240 --> 01:43.460]  You hear that if you hold wide, the car goes faster.
[01:44.420 --> 01:44.900]  Oh.
[01:46.880 --> 01:48.720]  Oh, my God.
[01:48.740 --> 01:49.440]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:49.880 --> 01:51.160]  Holy shit.
[01:51.820 --> 01:53.380]  Oh, my God.
[01:53.380 --> 01:55.160]  That was like a movie.
[01:56.660 --> 01:57.700]  That was so cool.
[01:57.700 --> 01:59.700]  This vehicle is 100% death proof.
[02:02.680 --> 02:03.160]  Wow.
[02:04.320 --> 02:07.200]  Man, they really nerfed back the vehicle damage in online mode.
[02:07.760 --> 02:08.260]  Oh, really?
[02:09.720 --> 02:13.160]  I mean, you've got like GTA 4, which is like you hit a lamppost
[02:13.160 --> 02:14.520]  and you have half a car left.
[02:15.680 --> 02:17.240]  Then GTA 5 is turned down.
[02:17.360 --> 02:20.720]  Then online, it's like nothing moves on the car.
[02:20.960 --> 02:21.700]  You just bumper cars the whole thing.
[02:22.620 --> 02:24.200]  How are you two doing up there?
[02:24.480 --> 02:27.820]  I just slammed into Nick's side in a game of The Biggest Laugh.
[02:28.180 --> 02:30.100]  Oh, I had fun.
[02:30.500 --> 02:36.860]  Since the last video, Eric and I have made stickers of team tape that we could put on our iMessage.
[02:37.020 --> 02:37.980]  Yeah, it's been pretty good.
[02:38.140 --> 02:38.580]  Wow.
[02:38.940 --> 02:43.580]  We've also seen the point of view from Gavin's back-to-the-camera.
[02:43.620 --> 02:48.500]  Oh, yeah. We re-watched every moment where everybody's fucked up.
[02:48.640 --> 02:49.360]  It's pretty exciting.
[02:50.660 --> 02:51.460]  Where are you going?
[02:51.720 --> 02:52.280]  Oh, my God.
[02:52.360 --> 02:54.480]  Oh, you saw a bike? That was it?
[02:54.700 --> 02:54.780]  Yeah.
[02:55.940 --> 02:56.640]  Advantage point.
[02:57.240 --> 02:58.040]  Oh, God!
[02:58.880 --> 02:59.960]  Oh, my God!
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.300]  Wait for the crew to get to position.
[03:02.300 --> 03:03.840]  Did they hit your car? Is that what caused that?
[03:04.940 --> 03:06.940]  Alright, I'm the bodyguard, so I'm just gonna look tough.
[03:07.180 --> 03:07.360]  Yeah.
[03:07.660 --> 03:09.760]  What gun is my most imposing?
[03:11.160 --> 03:11.840]  Maybe this?
[03:12.640 --> 03:13.320]  Yeah, probably.
[03:17.300 --> 03:18.420]  You are a freak.
[03:18.900 --> 03:20.840]  As the buyer, you have to put up with this.
[03:20.840 --> 03:21.960]  Why are you dancing?
[03:22.820 --> 03:23.280]  What do you mean?
[03:23.320 --> 03:26.800]  If I was the seller, I would turn away as I drove in.
[03:26.840 --> 03:27.560]  No, no.
[03:28.740 --> 03:30.300]  I mean, yeah, yeah.
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:34.260 --> 03:36.020]  Is that the...
[03:36.020 --> 03:36.680]  I think that's them.
[03:37.880 --> 03:38.780]  I think that's them, guys.
[03:38.780 --> 03:39.320]  I hope it is.
[03:40.620 --> 03:41.560]  That boss rooting?
[03:45.700 --> 03:46.140]  Okay.
[03:51.620 --> 03:53.020]  I love all the coats.
[03:56.900 --> 03:58.680]  You don't know shit, woman!
[03:58.960 --> 03:59.540]  Yeah, that's right.
[04:02.540 --> 04:03.920]  That's why I painted my face green.
[04:04.920 --> 04:06.720]  You look like Shrek sat on your face.
[04:09.980 --> 04:11.700]  So, the ambush is gonna come.
[04:11.860 --> 04:13.080]  Uh-oh!
[04:15.080 --> 04:15.560]  Well...
[04:16.100 --> 04:16.580]  Boss!
[04:18.960 --> 04:20.060]  Do you have a warrant?
[04:22.820 --> 04:23.620]  Alright, uh...
[04:23.620 --> 04:25.820]  If you can get to my armored car...
[04:25.820 --> 04:27.120]  Which is gone. Never mind.
[04:29.540 --> 04:30.340]  Okay, uh...
[04:30.340 --> 04:31.220]  This is bad.
[04:31.400 --> 04:32.200]  That's a lot of guys.
[04:34.740 --> 04:36.080]  Gavin, did you just blow up that car?
[04:37.660 --> 04:39.060]  Oh my god, Gavin!
[04:39.260 --> 04:40.260]  We just started!
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.580]  Okay, so I opened fire on the FIB
[04:44.580 --> 04:45.640]  and I was strafing.
[04:46.060 --> 04:48.100]  And I actually strafed into a car
[04:48.100 --> 04:49.480]  that was about one foot in front of me
[04:49.480 --> 04:50.160]  and it exploded.
[04:51.940 --> 04:53.560]  I think I leveled up from that.
[04:53.680 --> 04:54.960]  I think I almost...
[04:55.420 --> 04:56.580]  I'm almost to the next level.
[04:56.720 --> 04:59.160]  How far back do you think it puts us?
[04:59.180 --> 05:00.800]  Right in the cutscene again.
[05:00.980 --> 05:03.240]  It has to be the ambush, yeah.
[05:04.180 --> 05:05.740]  Wow, I need to get some distance
[05:05.740 --> 05:07.360]  from any cars
[05:07.360 --> 05:08.760]  that may be between me and the enemy.
[05:09.240 --> 05:10.540]  Wow, that was...
[05:10.540 --> 05:11.780]  That was fast.
[05:13.700 --> 05:15.400]  This is just hanging for me now.
[05:15.640 --> 05:17.200]  I'm just looking at the city from over top.
[05:17.200 --> 05:18.160]  That is not a good sign.
[05:18.360 --> 05:20.440]  You got it.
[05:21.020 --> 05:21.620]  Oh yeah?
[05:23.020 --> 05:25.080]  I spent more time looking down at the city
[05:25.080 --> 05:26.020]  than I have in it.
[05:31.120 --> 05:31.980]  That's pretty good.
[05:33.080 --> 05:33.700]  There we go.
[05:33.780 --> 05:35.580]  Here we go, boys.
[05:36.420 --> 05:38.140]  We have to watch the damn cutscene again.
[05:44.540 --> 05:44.940]  Everybody!
[05:44.940 --> 05:45.560]  Everybody!
[05:46.540 --> 05:47.360]  Okay, here we go.
[05:48.180 --> 05:51.260]  Alright, everyone get to your positions.
[05:51.880 --> 05:53.320]  Yep, going up the ladder again.
[05:55.760 --> 05:57.120]  I apparently shot
[05:57.120 --> 05:58.780]  210 bullets already.
[05:59.060 --> 05:59.640]  Oh my god.
[06:01.080 --> 06:02.780]  Oh, my armored car is out there.
[06:03.460 --> 06:04.200]  I could bring it in.
[06:06.620 --> 06:08.480]  What the fuck? Andrew, what are you doing?
[06:08.920 --> 06:09.760]  What was that?
[06:10.120 --> 06:11.140]  What is happening?
[06:12.540 --> 06:12.900]  I...
[06:16.100 --> 06:17.260]  What did you do?
[06:17.620 --> 06:18.540]  Andrew threw a grenade
[06:18.540 --> 06:19.940]  and blew up a car.
[06:21.140 --> 06:22.200]  We already have
[06:22.880 --> 06:23.880]  the system out.
[06:24.660 --> 06:25.540]  No, I got it out.
[06:26.080 --> 06:29.300]  I saw Eric posing on the car, so I wanted to see if I could launch him
[06:29.300 --> 06:30.660]  off of it by blowing up the vehicle.
[06:30.840 --> 06:33.180]  I didn't think about the fact that that would end the mission as well.
[06:33.320 --> 06:35.360]  Oh my god, it's launched us further back.
[06:36.080 --> 06:36.660]  Hey, Andrew.
[06:38.720 --> 06:40.340]  No, we have to restart!
[06:48.220 --> 06:49.380]  Oh no!
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.480]  Don't let him in!
[06:52.880 --> 06:53.860]  Oh my god, no.
[06:55.040 --> 06:56.220]  That's a good point, hold on.
[06:56.960 --> 06:57.740]  Kick his ass out.
[06:58.780 --> 06:59.920]  Manage vehicles.
[07:00.440 --> 07:01.780]  Oh no!
[07:03.660 --> 07:04.740]  Which side do you think
[07:04.740 --> 07:05.520]  he's going to come out on?
[07:06.560 --> 07:07.040]  Perfect.
[07:07.560 --> 07:07.920]  There he goes.
[07:10.680 --> 07:12.560]  I got such a good shot of that!
[07:12.680 --> 07:13.680]  That was awesome!
[07:15.680 --> 07:17.240]  You kicked him out of the vehicle
[07:17.240 --> 07:18.960]  and he just ran him over.
[07:20.900 --> 07:21.980]  God damn it.
[07:22.460 --> 07:24.000]  That'll learn you, you son of a bitch.
[07:25.220 --> 07:26.180]  I appreciate
[07:27.260 --> 07:28.900]  that we're a heist crew
[07:28.900 --> 07:30.500]  that is willing to punish each other.
[07:30.560 --> 07:32.780]  Yeah, there are consequences.
[07:32.780 --> 07:33.480]  Absolutely!
[07:35.520 --> 07:36.440]  Oh god.
[07:37.960 --> 07:38.960]  Oh man.
[07:39.060 --> 07:39.720]  Oh shit.
[07:41.000 --> 07:42.900]  Oh, that's so lucky that we could
[07:42.900 --> 07:43.860]  drive through those, bud.
[07:44.280 --> 07:45.060]  Holy shit.
[07:46.980 --> 07:48.480]  Dude, we're a ragged asshole.
[07:48.820 --> 07:50.040]  Yeah, this is quick.
[07:50.120 --> 07:52.660]  Aw, damn you.
[07:55.220 --> 07:56.840]  What? Okay, so
[07:56.840 --> 07:57.640]  what was that one?
[07:57.640 --> 07:59.740]  Just follow up.
[08:00.760 --> 08:01.660]  Oh my god.
[08:01.720 --> 08:02.420]  April, my email.
[08:08.980 --> 08:11.300]  This is the first mission, this is the beginning.
[08:13.560 --> 08:15.700]  Getting out of the system now.
[08:17.980 --> 08:19.920]  I don't have this in my
[08:19.920 --> 08:21.780]  system. You guys are talking about
[08:21.780 --> 08:23.800]  this like, oh yeah, naturally we have to get this out.
[08:23.900 --> 08:25.060]  I don't have this. I gotta get out?
[08:25.060 --> 08:27.160]  I don't have this in me. Oh, really?
[08:27.360 --> 08:29.240]  I didn't have my crashing
[08:29.240 --> 08:31.340]  the plane into the wind farm. Oh, look at these guys.
[08:31.640 --> 08:33.220]  I think Nick
[08:33.220 --> 08:35.260]  crashing the plane into the wind farm
[08:35.260 --> 08:37.400]  has put a lot of stuff in all of our systems.
[08:37.480 --> 08:39.400]  I think I may have undone a lot.
[08:41.920 --> 08:42.880]  Of good will.
[08:43.940 --> 08:44.920]  Yeah, I agree.
[08:46.380 --> 08:48.100]  Come on, we have to get in position.
[08:51.060 --> 08:51.800]  Almost there.
[08:52.920 --> 08:53.880]  Took a wrong
[08:53.880 --> 08:54.400]  turn.
[08:58.480 --> 09:00.840]  If you fuck this up.
[09:02.060 --> 09:03.280]  That was quite
[09:03.280 --> 09:04.340]  the entrance. I liked it.
[09:05.860 --> 09:07.400]  What's that fence doing?
[09:08.720 --> 09:09.460]  Oh, it's
[09:09.460 --> 09:09.920]  dancing.
[09:11.560 --> 09:12.780]  Oh, I get that.
[09:13.140 --> 09:14.300]  It's dancing? Hell yeah.
[09:15.300 --> 09:16.220]  Gavin likes it.
[09:16.540 --> 09:18.020]  Waiting for contact.
[09:22.300 --> 09:24.340]  Are we locked in?
[09:24.660 --> 09:24.980]  Oh, okay.
[09:27.820 --> 09:29.560]  Oh my god, that fence!
[09:35.120 --> 09:37.040]  Yeah, what is that?
[09:37.260 --> 09:37.620]  That's weird.
[09:38.320 --> 09:40.040]  Alright, we're locked in.
[09:41.320 --> 09:42.800]  Andrew, I don't suppose you can hit...
[09:42.800 --> 09:43.640]  Look at my guy.
[09:43.700 --> 09:45.460]  He's very obviously up there.
[09:46.920 --> 09:47.860]  Yeah, you're sneaky.
[09:48.780 --> 09:49.420]  Alright, Gavin.
[09:49.860 --> 09:50.940]  You have the opportunity
[09:50.940 --> 09:52.020]  to do the funniest thing.
[09:54.500 --> 09:54.900]  I
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.400]  don't like that phrase.
[10:04.280 --> 10:05.240]  Shit, wrong gun.
[10:05.700 --> 10:07.340]  Where am I getting fucking hit from?
[10:07.440 --> 10:08.220]  What is happening?
[10:10.200 --> 10:11.760]  I died. I don't know how I died.
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.540]  I was stuck to a car.
[10:13.700 --> 10:14.400]  Couldn't get out of it.
[10:15.640 --> 10:17.080]  I was stuck to the front of the car.
[10:17.280 --> 10:18.600]  It would not let me out.
[10:18.600 --> 10:19.740]  I think I really like that cutscene.
[10:20.720 --> 10:21.740]  Run it back!
[10:27.040 --> 10:28.380]  Suppressing the front. Nice.
[10:29.660 --> 10:30.320]  Good job, Gavin.
[10:35.020 --> 10:36.820]  Oh, Gavin, you're getting walled,
[10:36.880 --> 10:37.160]  Gavin.
[10:39.180 --> 10:40.560]  Aim, dummy!
[10:43.060 --> 10:44.660]  Oh, they're right under me,
[10:44.900 --> 10:45.220]  Andrew.
[10:45.220 --> 10:45.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:47.800 --> 10:48.560]  There you go.
[10:48.780 --> 10:50.680]  Good job, good job.
[10:50.940 --> 10:52.580]  Gavin, you wanna switch to something else?
[10:54.560 --> 10:55.720]  You unhappy with my rockets?
[10:55.820 --> 10:57.180]  No, no, no, I feel like you're doing fine.
[10:57.520 --> 10:59.140]  I just wanted to make sure that you were feeling good.
[11:00.000 --> 11:00.760]  I feel decent.
[11:01.360 --> 11:02.720]  We got more company coming.
[11:03.600 --> 11:03.820]  Okay.
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.440]  I'm gonna watch this back.
[11:07.940 --> 11:08.960]  Coming from the back there.
[11:11.160 --> 11:12.680]  A bunch coming from that one alley.
[11:12.680 --> 11:13.040]  Yup.
[11:15.100 --> 11:16.080]  Gavin's got them.
[11:17.200 --> 11:18.500]  Look back for this alley.
[11:18.960 --> 11:19.500]  There they come.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.100]  Good lord, Gavin.
[11:22.460 --> 11:23.320]  Should be one more.
[11:24.520 --> 11:25.460]  I'll heal up and see if I can get them.
[11:28.600 --> 11:28.980]  I see them.
[11:29.360 --> 11:31.400]  Oh, second one spawned.
[11:31.660 --> 11:33.920]  I got the briefcase.
[11:34.860 --> 11:36.100]  Oh, shit. What do we do?
[11:36.860 --> 11:38.380]  Okay, Gavin, we gotta drive. Let's go.
[11:38.700 --> 11:39.280]  Wait for me, fellas.
[11:39.280 --> 11:39.680]  Where's my car?
[11:39.960 --> 11:41.820]  I don't know. It's gone. Where are you, Nick?
[11:42.680 --> 11:45.080]  I'm in the parking lot right behind you.
[11:45.800 --> 11:47.620]  There's a two-seater. We gotta go.
[11:47.740 --> 11:48.900]  I'm getting in this one.
[11:50.720 --> 11:51.400]  Let's go.
[11:51.400 --> 11:52.080]  Go, go, go, go.
[11:52.080 --> 11:53.420]  Slow piece of shit.
[11:56.840 --> 11:57.740]  We're good. You're good.
[11:58.400 --> 11:59.220]  You're doing great.
[12:01.120 --> 12:01.520]  Whoa!
[12:04.200 --> 12:05.520]  You're doing good, Gavin.
[12:05.800 --> 12:06.240]  You got this.
[12:06.240 --> 12:07.720]  Oh, fuck me!
[12:09.500 --> 12:10.760]  They launched me over,
[12:10.880 --> 12:12.320]  so then I was trying to get back to...
[12:12.320 --> 12:13.140]  You're fine. You're good.
[12:13.180 --> 12:15.060]  Oh, no. I went underground.
[12:22.360 --> 12:23.900]  With you, Nick. I'm right behind you.
[12:24.120 --> 12:26.640]  Well, you could probably be in front of me
[12:26.640 --> 12:28.280]  with how fast this thing's going.
[12:28.800 --> 12:30.360]  Okay, we're good. They're just on our tail, but we're good.
[12:30.500 --> 12:31.400]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[12:31.960 --> 12:32.960]  You can shoot back at them.
[12:32.960 --> 12:35.060]  I know. I'm keeping an eye on it behind us.
[12:35.120 --> 12:37.000]  Guys, watch out. They're coming up in front of you.
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.040]  Ah, shit.
[12:39.300 --> 12:41.120]  Oh, we lost them. Wait. Hang on.
[12:41.300 --> 12:42.260]  Keep going, Gavin. You're good.
[12:42.900 --> 12:44.240]  Oh, fuck. I think we're okay.
[12:45.300 --> 12:47.040]  There's one guy trailing us
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.560]  right now. He's in front of you.
[12:48.640 --> 12:51.000]  Oh, my God. Oh, shit.
[12:51.540 --> 12:52.200]  Uh-oh.
[12:52.640 --> 12:53.280]  Oh, no.
[12:54.200 --> 12:55.060]  Gavin, flip it.
[12:57.220 --> 12:57.500]  Oh!
[12:59.980 --> 13:00.980]  All right. That's all right.
[13:01.700 --> 13:02.880]  Okay, we made it. We're good.
[13:02.940 --> 13:03.200]  We're good.
[13:03.760 --> 13:06.080]  We had to make our own excitement.
[13:07.640 --> 13:09.160]  Slow down. Slow down!
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.940]  Am I driving with my mom again?
[13:15.100 --> 13:16.240]  What the...
[13:16.240 --> 13:17.200]  Oh, God.
[13:20.260 --> 13:21.300]  Okay, me and Gavin are here.
[13:21.880 --> 13:23.580]  Well done. Nice. Shit.
[13:25.080 --> 13:25.480]  Nailed it.
[13:26.260 --> 13:27.300]  Goddamn. First time.
[13:28.680 --> 13:29.780]  Yeah, leveled up, baby.
[13:30.640 --> 13:31.640]  Good job, guys.
[13:33.360 --> 13:33.800]  Nice.
[13:35.720 --> 13:36.160]  First
[13:36.160 --> 13:37.420]  section done.
[13:39.340 --> 13:39.780]  Platinum.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.720]  It must not take into account all of the
[13:41.720 --> 13:42.320]  other ones.
[13:43.880 --> 13:44.200]  Bronze.
[13:45.080 --> 13:46.420]  How did you get bronze?
[13:47.180 --> 13:49.540]  You were driving great. You were shooting great.
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.680]  I feel like you did a lot of the work.
[13:50.940 --> 13:52.160]  I feel like it was your heavy lift.
[13:52.820 --> 13:54.740]  Maybe too much. Maybe they thought you were hogging.
[13:57.100 --> 13:57.860]  Hell, yeah.
[13:58.920 --> 13:59.980]  Okay, me and Gavin are team
[13:59.980 --> 14:00.300]  suits.
[14:02.080 --> 14:04.000]  I'm a scruffy suit and you're a neat suit.
[14:05.360 --> 14:05.940]  Team tape
[14:05.940 --> 14:07.240]  wasn't. I mean, we're still team tape.
[14:07.460 --> 14:09.240]  Oh, yeah, we're absolutely team tape.
[14:10.100 --> 14:10.440]  Alright.
[14:12.300 --> 14:13.000]  Burger car.
[14:16.900 --> 14:17.440]  I want to see
[14:17.440 --> 14:18.540]  what happens when I ride with Andrew.
[14:19.700 --> 14:20.540]  What the fuck?
[14:21.420 --> 14:22.440]  Piece of shit.
[14:23.060 --> 14:25.520]  Alright, do it! Do it! Piece of shit.
[14:26.220 --> 14:27.100]  I'm not doing anything.
[14:27.100 --> 14:28.180]  That's just a precaution.
[14:28.360 --> 14:29.120]  That's smart.
[14:30.340 --> 14:32.400]  In case anything gets tried.
[14:32.740 --> 14:33.480]  Team tape.
[14:41.090 --> 14:42.410]  Alright, Gavin, I got cinematic
[14:42.410 --> 14:43.870]  mode on. We look so sick.
[14:44.010 --> 14:45.650]  This looks like Midnight Club or whatever.
[14:45.930 --> 14:46.910]  What was the fucking Rockstar game?
[14:47.930 --> 14:49.430]  Was that a Rockstar game?
[14:49.790 --> 14:54.690]  Yeah, they made the table tennis game and they made the driving game.
[14:54.770 --> 14:54.990]  Wow.
[14:55.230 --> 14:56.830]  And then they only made Grand Theft Auto.
[14:58.270 --> 15:00.310]  I think my copy of Xbox Live
[15:00.310 --> 15:01.410]  came with Midnight Club.
[15:02.630 --> 15:02.990]  Really?
[15:05.770 --> 15:08.190]  Back when you had to buy Xbox Live as a thing
[15:08.190 --> 15:10.010]  to stick in the top of your controller
[15:10.010 --> 15:10.970]  so you could talk to people.
[15:21.480 --> 15:23.100]  Did it say to go up here, Nick?
[15:23.180 --> 15:24.680]  No, it didn't.
[15:24.760 --> 15:26.780]  I make my own way, Gavin.
[15:27.460 --> 15:29.480]  You followed him up here and I was just going like,
[15:29.480 --> 15:30.380]  well, that's weird.
[15:31.800 --> 15:33.020]  I just thought Nick knew what he was doing.
[15:34.180 --> 15:36.380]  What has led you to believe that?
[15:36.560 --> 15:37.240]  I was about to say.
[15:37.640 --> 15:39.520]  I think it was the extra hour of content
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.440]  from the last heist.
[15:43.900 --> 15:44.940]  Oh my God.
[15:45.140 --> 15:46.480]  He's gotta jump the ledge, fellas.
[15:48.060 --> 15:49.020]  Nice job.
[15:50.080 --> 15:50.520]  Jumped it.
[15:51.960 --> 15:53.020]  Oh my God.
[15:53.360 --> 15:54.240]  Oh, Gavin, no.
[15:55.660 --> 15:58.260]  How many times are you gonna jump?
[15:59.480 --> 16:00.820]  And we're good.
[16:13.400 --> 16:14.880]  Don't land on the tree. Stop!
[16:15.380 --> 16:16.140]  Damn it.
[16:19.900 --> 16:21.000]  Oh my God.
[16:21.060 --> 16:21.520]  The tree?
[16:24.060 --> 16:25.100]  It's a pretty big jump
[16:25.100 --> 16:25.700]  coming up, Eric.
[16:27.320 --> 16:28.200]  I'm ready.
[16:28.820 --> 16:29.280]  No witnesses.
[16:30.680 --> 16:31.660]  Cinema mode.
[16:32.880 --> 16:33.500]  Oh!
[16:33.500 --> 16:36.080]  Oh, I got such a good
[16:36.080 --> 16:37.300]  angle of that.
[16:38.380 --> 16:39.720]  Did you guys
[16:39.720 --> 16:40.040]  see that?
[16:40.440 --> 16:43.000]  You cratered.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.680]  Like a shooting star across my screen.
[16:45.800 --> 16:46.600]  Put your mask on.
[16:49.420 --> 16:51.240]  Wow, you guys are holding up there.
[16:51.600 --> 16:52.340]  Yeah, boy.
[16:53.360 --> 16:53.960]  Oh God.
[16:54.180 --> 16:55.920]  I missed the direction.
[16:58.280 --> 16:59.460]  Oh, swing around.
[16:59.460 --> 16:59.940]  Oh my God.
[17:05.200 --> 17:05.920]  Geronies!
[17:08.960 --> 17:10.640]  From the top rope!
[17:11.480 --> 17:13.420]  Don't run over my friend.
[17:17.200 --> 17:19.580]  Gavin, I'm backing up.
[17:19.700 --> 17:21.140]  Gavin, I'm backing up to you.
[17:22.220 --> 17:23.400]  Gavin, hop in.
[17:26.580 --> 17:27.300]  Gavin!
[17:27.660 --> 17:28.520]  Let's go!
[17:28.520 --> 17:29.000]  Okay.
[17:29.980 --> 17:31.040]  Get us out of here.
[17:31.520 --> 17:33.100]  Andrew, wait for me.
[17:33.240 --> 17:36.160]  Is there a mounted machine gun you can use?
[17:36.660 --> 17:36.820]  Oh!
[17:38.440 --> 17:39.360]  Andrew died.
[17:40.620 --> 17:41.140]  Okay.
[17:42.560 --> 17:44.280]  You took the insurgent
[17:44.280 --> 17:45.540]  in 18 different directions.
[17:45.700 --> 17:47.200]  I took the insurgent without the turret.
[17:48.960 --> 17:50.620]  Oh, I didn't get you.
[17:50.620 --> 17:51.320]  Those two.
[17:51.860 --> 17:52.320]  Oh, okay.
[17:53.860 --> 17:55.460]  They were like, hey, where's the gun?
[17:55.460 --> 17:56.120]  I don't know.
[17:57.380 --> 17:58.880]  I was leaving anyway.
[17:59.280 --> 18:00.640]  We were flying out of there.
[18:00.740 --> 18:02.260]  We didn't need the gun.
[18:02.320 --> 18:05.620]  I went to the middle to pull the vehicle
[18:05.620 --> 18:07.140]  out and then Nix yelled
[18:07.140 --> 18:09.100]  wait for me and I got
[18:09.100 --> 18:11.240]  shot at from 20 different angles
[18:11.240 --> 18:12.040]  so I'm just parked.
[18:13.140 --> 18:14.620]  Oh, well this is
[18:15.500 --> 18:17.420]  forgiving. Andrew does not
[18:17.420 --> 18:18.100]  have his mask on.
[18:19.340 --> 18:19.780]  Oh wow.
[18:20.040 --> 18:21.860]  No witnesses.
[18:21.860 --> 18:23.180]  Andrew is a boss.
[18:27.120 --> 18:28.180]  I'm wearing a baklava.
[18:28.500 --> 18:30.340]  It's all good.
[18:32.020 --> 18:33.180]  There's no one here.
[18:33.500 --> 18:34.100]  Sweet, we won.
[18:35.120 --> 18:36.120]  Okay, Nick, me and you.
[18:36.480 --> 18:38.840]  Oh, there's choppers coming.
[18:41.240 --> 18:42.420]  There's choppers coming.
[18:43.140 --> 18:43.880]  You're good.
[18:44.300 --> 18:45.720]  Just take your time.
[18:46.020 --> 18:48.260]  I understand.
[18:49.320 --> 18:50.700]  Oh my god!
[18:52.460 --> 18:53.500]  That worked out great.
[18:54.460 --> 18:55.180]  That was really cool.
[18:55.320 --> 18:56.400]  I like it.
[18:57.520 --> 18:58.300]  Take the shortcut.
[18:58.580 --> 18:59.800]  We'll make our own path.
[19:01.780 --> 19:02.740]  Follow us.
[19:03.100 --> 19:04.020]  Follow us.
[19:05.380 --> 19:05.960]  Fuck him.
[19:08.080 --> 19:09.780]  Oh, what the fuck was that?
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.920]  That was my flash from earlier.
[19:11.660 --> 19:12.600]  Oh, that's awesome.
[19:12.840 --> 19:15.040]  I got it.
[19:16.200 --> 19:16.680]  One.
[19:18.680 --> 19:19.440]  Just hold her steady.
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.640]  There you go.
[19:23.240 --> 19:23.640]  Andrew!
[19:24.680 --> 19:25.080]  Yup.
[19:26.240 --> 19:27.060]  You guys alright?
[19:28.760 --> 19:29.620]  Yeah, we're alright.
[19:30.760 --> 19:32.660]  It'd be nice to have the turret.
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.140]  Yeah, it's really nice to have the turret, dude.
[19:36.900 --> 19:39.640]  Yeah, it'd be nice to have the turret back here.
[19:39.920 --> 19:41.420]  Yeah, we got it up here.
[19:41.640 --> 19:43.080]  I totally agree, dude.
[19:43.200 --> 19:43.900]  It would be great.
[19:44.360 --> 19:45.920]  It would be fucking awesome if you had that.
[19:46.380 --> 19:46.560]  Oh!
[19:46.560 --> 19:46.700]  Oh!
[19:50.680 --> 19:51.040]  Breakdancing.
[19:51.460 --> 19:51.940]  Oh, we're good.
[19:52.700 --> 19:53.780]  I think we're crushing it right now.
[19:55.860 --> 19:57.500]  You're driving like a rockstar, man.
[19:57.500 --> 19:58.760]  I got this. I'm gonna blow shit up.
[19:59.060 --> 19:59.780]  You do that, Gavin?
[20:00.880 --> 20:03.000]  Oh, I died. Oh my god.
[20:04.180 --> 20:04.920]  Wait, what happened?
[20:05.240 --> 20:06.200]  How did I die?
[20:06.840 --> 20:08.460]  You shot me, I guess, through a window.
[20:09.280 --> 20:09.940]  Wait, hang on.
[20:11.540 --> 20:12.720]  We have another life?
[20:13.540 --> 20:15.680]  I'm getting lit up. I just spawned.
[20:15.680 --> 20:16.840]  Do we?
[20:17.280 --> 20:18.940]  I don't know how we would.
[20:19.480 --> 20:20.960]  Ah, that chopper!
[20:21.400 --> 20:21.720]  Ow!
[20:23.180 --> 20:24.420]  Where are you?
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.560]  Right here.
[20:27.140 --> 20:27.960]  Stop moving!
[20:28.220 --> 20:30.040]  Are you in?
[20:30.240 --> 20:31.820]  Hold Y to get on the gun.
[20:35.360 --> 20:37.360]  I'm getting fucking out of here.
[20:38.480 --> 20:39.460]  I don't want to deal with their bullshit.
[20:39.460 --> 20:41.340]  How did we drop a difficulty or something?
[20:42.300 --> 20:42.740]  I don't know.
[20:42.740 --> 20:45.520]  You have to set it every time, and I guess I forgot.
[20:45.740 --> 20:46.660]  But we restarted it.
[20:47.040 --> 20:47.820]  Do you have to set it then?
[20:50.220 --> 20:51.080]  I don't know.
[20:51.520 --> 20:52.280]  That's a good question.
[20:55.340 --> 20:57.900]  Yeah, why did we reset that one time if we were...
[20:57.900 --> 20:58.360]  I don't know.
[20:58.420 --> 20:59.400]  I'll teach that little prick.
[21:03.040 --> 21:03.680]  Oh dear.
[21:04.120 --> 21:05.220]  Almost at the drop-off.
[21:06.740 --> 21:08.540]  Just keep getting the guys behind us.
[21:08.900 --> 21:10.540]  There's a chopper in front.
[21:10.540 --> 21:12.200]  Try to focus on the cars.
[21:12.320 --> 21:13.620]  Oh yeah, there's another car.
[21:15.400 --> 21:16.540]  The cars are definitely...
[21:17.600 --> 21:18.680]  The cars are giving me
[21:18.680 --> 21:20.520]  more trouble than the...
[21:20.520 --> 21:20.920]  Oh, hello.
[21:21.280 --> 21:23.320]  Oh fuck, I died.
[21:23.980 --> 21:26.560]  A guy just rolled up alongside of us and just blew me away.
[21:26.680 --> 21:27.820]  Oh, come on!
[21:28.460 --> 21:29.540]  The armored cars!
[21:30.360 --> 21:31.700]  Yeah, but yours has a gun in it.
[21:31.720 --> 21:32.560]  The windows aren't armored.
[21:35.280 --> 21:36.880]  I'm just going to run to the closest vehicle.
[21:37.040 --> 21:38.220]  You're going to go to the right, Andrew.
[21:38.220 --> 21:38.900]  Go to the right, Andrew.
[21:39.860 --> 21:40.940]  Okay, I'll go right.
[21:41.600 --> 21:43.280]  I drive, you gun.
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.280]  Can I get in the back?
[21:48.380 --> 21:48.620]  Yes.
[21:49.680 --> 21:52.240]  I'm in, so now you can hold Y and get in the...
[21:52.240 --> 21:53.100]  Oh, I guess you don't have a gun.
[21:53.100 --> 21:54.720]  I'll wait for you guys and we'll roll together.
[21:55.680 --> 21:56.920]  Alright, let's go!
[21:59.680 --> 22:00.900]  Let's do this!
[22:03.860 --> 22:05.660]  I did use up a lot of my bombs.
[22:05.660 --> 22:06.860]  Yeah, I mean, I understand.
[22:07.460 --> 22:09.040]  Can you buy them from the ammo menu?
[22:10.320 --> 22:12.520]  Yeah, we're going to go straight over the train tracks.
[22:13.400 --> 22:14.240]  I'm going to follow them.
[22:14.400 --> 22:15.140]  Oh, I like that.
[22:19.780 --> 22:21.020]  And watch out for that.
[22:21.220 --> 22:23.660]  Go left. Off ramp.
[22:24.380 --> 22:25.200]  Whoa, off ramp.
[22:26.260 --> 22:27.080]  That's pretty cool.
[22:34.200 --> 22:34.640]  Handbrake.
[22:34.640 --> 22:36.160]  I think that's just a civilian vehicle.
[22:36.220 --> 22:38.840]  Well, they can be objects of...
[22:38.840 --> 22:39.660]  blocking.
[22:40.280 --> 22:42.760]  I was unloading on them.
[22:43.500 --> 22:44.820]  I'm just following them, Gavin.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.380]  Why are they driving so late at night?
[22:46.520 --> 22:47.920]  Trying to give y'all support in the back.
[22:48.300 --> 22:49.720]  Surely they can't be up to any good.
[22:54.560 --> 22:55.640]  What the fuck?
[22:56.640 --> 22:57.420]  That's a stick.
[23:00.940 --> 23:01.940]  That's a big stick.
[23:01.940 --> 23:02.400]  Oh!
[23:04.100 --> 23:05.920]  That chopper is trying to unload on us.
[23:05.920 --> 23:06.840]  How you two doing back there?
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.140]  We're good. We're right behind you.
[23:08.420 --> 23:08.980]  How's your health?
[23:10.440 --> 23:12.340]  I'm losing some armor, but I'm good.
[23:13.200 --> 23:14.720]  Yeah, we're doing way better this time.
[23:16.240 --> 23:17.180]  Alright, team tape.
[23:17.780 --> 23:19.320]  One of the helicopters down.
[23:20.800 --> 23:21.360]  Don't worry.
[23:21.660 --> 23:22.560]  Oh, I'm getting lit up.
[23:22.780 --> 23:24.260]  You got shot a lot there.
[23:24.440 --> 23:25.920]  Oh, I'm getting lit up here.
[23:27.080 --> 23:28.400]  That was bad.
[23:28.400 --> 23:29.340]  Got two of them.
[23:29.480 --> 23:29.880]  Nice.
[23:31.320 --> 23:32.600]  Nice job.
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.120]  Excuse me.
[23:37.260 --> 23:39.520]  There's one trying to stop us on the bridge.
[23:40.460 --> 23:41.360]  Not today.
[23:41.820 --> 23:42.020]  Whoops.
[23:42.720 --> 23:45.060]  Uh oh.
[23:45.380 --> 23:46.620]  I'm almost out of health.
[23:47.580 --> 23:49.360]  Eat some snacks.
[23:50.760 --> 23:52.200]  Get that PB and J going.
[23:52.200 --> 23:52.280]  Gavin!
[23:55.800 --> 23:56.700]  Suppressing in the back.
[23:56.880 --> 23:57.480]  Oh, what the fuck?
[24:01.140 --> 24:02.760]  Whatever the vehicle stops,
[24:02.860 --> 24:04.580]  knowing Gavin's throwing bombs left and right,
[24:04.680 --> 24:06.040]  I guess we're doing this for you guys.
[24:06.360 --> 24:08.400]  I hit the one sign that didn't go down.
[24:08.620 --> 24:09.580]  You just run into it.
[24:12.440 --> 24:13.980]  Some city official that's like,
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.220]  I fucking told you guys.
[24:15.340 --> 24:17.380]  There we go.
[24:17.820 --> 24:18.560]  Good job, Gavin.
[24:21.620 --> 24:22.100]  Suppressing.
[24:22.860 --> 24:23.580]  I might be out of bombs.
[24:23.860 --> 24:24.440]  I am.
[24:24.940 --> 24:26.620]  Shit, I'm almost out of health.
[24:27.240 --> 24:29.320]  I'm getting annihilated right now.
[24:29.680 --> 24:30.860]  Proxy mines, I can try that.
[24:31.360 --> 24:32.260]  Ah, shit. Sorry.
[24:32.320 --> 24:34.980]  What happened?
[24:35.220 --> 24:36.060]  I died. It's alright.
[24:40.410 --> 24:41.950]  Run faster, prick!
[24:42.950 --> 24:44.110]  I'm just going to keep rolling, Gavin.
[24:45.150 --> 24:45.530]  Nice.
[24:49.540 --> 24:51.280]  Please run, damn you.
[24:53.280 --> 24:54.420]  Are you guys parked?
[24:54.820 --> 24:57.460]  Yeah, they decided that was close enough.
[24:59.640 --> 25:00.680]  Take out Merriweather?
[25:00.820 --> 25:01.780]  Oh, what the fuck?
[25:01.880 --> 25:03.700]  Alright, I'm in route. Let's go.
[25:03.940 --> 25:05.080]  Oh, shit!
[25:06.740 --> 25:08.240]  Turret is on its way.
[25:08.580 --> 25:10.080]  This is where we're supposed to take him, right?
[25:12.160 --> 25:13.460]  I think you just killed the jogger.
[25:14.180 --> 25:14.420]  Cool.
[25:15.920 --> 25:16.920]  Is this the drop-off?
[25:17.100 --> 25:17.280]  Yeah.
[25:18.180 --> 25:18.580]  Yep.
[25:19.700 --> 25:20.580]  That's a bad guy!
[25:23.380 --> 25:24.420]  We're so close.
[25:25.460 --> 25:27.220]  15, 14, 13, 12.
[25:28.080 --> 25:28.600]  Can you kill that guy?
[25:29.820 --> 25:31.220]  Feet! We're feet away.
[25:32.280 --> 25:33.400]  Oh, I shot his dick. Hold on.
[25:35.260 --> 25:36.500]  Good, good, good. We got it.
[25:37.880 --> 25:38.200]  Oh!
[25:38.780 --> 25:39.780]  I saw that.
[25:48.420 --> 25:49.580]  I think we did it.
[25:49.580 --> 25:51.100]  There we go.
[25:51.680 --> 25:53.920]  I just had to finagle where the parking was.
[25:58.200 --> 25:59.580]  Can't skip it.
[26:10.580 --> 26:12.140]  Can I kill him?
[26:17.290 --> 26:19.350]  I want to plan a real heist.
[26:19.350 --> 26:20.830]  Oh, yeah?
[26:22.030 --> 26:24.850]  To heist something that's not that criminal.
[26:26.750 --> 26:30.830]  What's the least criminal thing that would still give you the thrill of the heist?
[26:30.970 --> 26:31.790]  It's got to be something with Geoffs.
[26:32.230 --> 26:33.950]  We have to steal something from Geoffs.
[26:33.970 --> 26:35.110]  Now we're talking.
[26:35.690 --> 26:36.790]  That's a good call.
[26:39.450 --> 26:40.390]  What do we steal?
[26:42.990 --> 26:44.410]  His shit shades, maybe?
[26:44.790 --> 26:45.810]  Are they just in the bathroom?
[26:46.690 --> 26:48.490]  It has to be something he'd notice.
[26:49.350 --> 26:51.850]  How about the Alexa that never works when we give it a time?
[26:53.250 --> 26:55.530]  What if it's a reverse steal?
[26:56.290 --> 26:58.350]  Oh, we're planting something in his hole.
[26:58.650 --> 27:03.810]  What if Geoff comes down from his little sleep and there's a port-a-potty in his living room?
[27:04.390 --> 27:06.030]  Oh, that. Now we're talking.
[27:06.330 --> 27:07.530]  I love that.
[27:09.230 --> 27:14.650]  Just on the topic of stealing things, I'd like to also nominate taking his PS5.
[27:15.130 --> 27:17.630]  Yeah, but it has to be something he would notice.
[27:18.950 --> 27:20.890]  I just plugged it in and did everything.
[27:21.090 --> 27:23.590]  Maybe now that it's set up, that's when I get it back.
[27:23.710 --> 27:24.590]  He would never notice.
[27:25.930 --> 27:26.610]  What up, fellas?
[27:28.090 --> 27:28.790]  How you doing?
[27:29.130 --> 27:31.130]  Is it going to be Nick and I in the helicopters?
[27:31.490 --> 27:33.630]  It says like half of us are in helicopters.
[27:34.650 --> 27:35.830]  Can you skip this one?
[27:37.350 --> 27:38.150]  I can.
[27:38.330 --> 27:39.250]  How about it?
[27:39.750 --> 27:41.890]  Here we go, fellas. Here we go.
[27:44.790 --> 27:45.270]  Oh boy.
[27:46.410 --> 27:47.990]  Andrew's going to select it. Here we go.
[27:48.130 --> 27:49.630]  Oh boy.
[27:50.890 --> 27:53.550]  Okay, it's on hard, so we're good there.
[27:57.380 --> 27:59.860]  It looks like we're one team.
[28:00.000 --> 28:00.560]  I guess not.
[28:01.780 --> 28:03.060]  I'm stealth pilot.
[28:03.360 --> 28:05.040]  I'm going to do tactical stealth.
[28:05.620 --> 28:06.420]  Looks sick.
[28:08.300 --> 28:09.000]  I like that.
[28:09.920 --> 28:11.180]  Skulls. God damn it.
[28:11.620 --> 28:13.520]  They don't have...
[28:13.520 --> 28:14.120]  again.
[28:14.820 --> 28:17.400]  You can be my wingman anytime.
[28:21.380 --> 28:22.460]  Is that what he says?
[28:23.340 --> 28:25.500]  Does that mean they hold hands?
[28:26.120 --> 28:26.900]  Are you talking about Iceman?
[28:27.440 --> 28:28.720]  And Val Kilmer? Yeah.
[28:29.920 --> 28:30.900]  Is that the first one?
[28:31.640 --> 28:32.580]  Yeah, I think it's the first one.
[28:32.820 --> 28:33.980]  It's the end of the first one?
[28:35.320 --> 28:36.100]  Okay, so what's the...
[28:36.100 --> 28:37.220]  I never saw the second one.
[28:38.020 --> 28:40.180]  The second one is actually good.
[28:40.580 --> 28:41.500]  Very, very good.
[28:42.880 --> 28:44.340]  The first one's tough.
[28:44.760 --> 28:46.340]  The first one's great.
[28:47.180 --> 28:47.960]  The first Top Gun?
[28:48.760 --> 28:49.200]  Yeah.
[28:49.540 --> 28:51.620]  It is Toilet.
[28:52.620 --> 28:54.020]  Get out of here.
[28:56.780 --> 28:58.560]  Here's the thing about the first one.
[28:58.840 --> 28:59.920]  You gotta watch it. It's a classic.
[29:00.420 --> 29:02.560]  But it's a watch once only sort of deal.
[29:02.680 --> 29:05.380]  I feel like I could watch the second one at least five times before I die.
[29:05.640 --> 29:08.520]  The first Top Gun to me is like the perfect TV movie.
[29:09.200 --> 29:10.260]  Top Gun's on.
[29:11.140 --> 29:14.260]  Hold on for ten minutes, watch it for the whole hour or whatever.
[29:14.440 --> 29:16.700]  Is that the definition of a good movie? Watch it for ten minutes?
[29:17.660 --> 29:20.240]  No, like it's something that you'll stop on.
[29:20.980 --> 29:22.680]  And then you end up watching the whole thing.
[29:22.860 --> 29:24.000]  Every time it's on TV.
[29:24.520 --> 29:25.660]  Well, that was unintentional, but it works.
[29:30.550 --> 29:31.470]  I agree with you, Andrew.
[29:31.670 --> 29:34.530]  Well, I don't know if I agree about that movie, but I like that thing.
[29:37.450 --> 29:39.830]  You like the premise in which I like the movie.
[29:39.830 --> 29:42.790]  Yes, absolutely. I have that with a bunch of movies.
[29:42.990 --> 29:46.290]  I watch movies like that. It's the best way to watch bad movies.
[29:48.230 --> 29:51.230]  Oh my God, how are we just getting these cars in our way, Nick?
[29:55.270 --> 29:58.430]  Oh, nice. We're in cinema mode right now too, so this looks sick.
[29:59.030 --> 30:01.050]  Yeah, this looks like a Michael Bay movie.
[30:01.170 --> 30:02.590]  This is how ambulances look.
[30:02.750 --> 30:03.730]  Oh yeah? Where are the drones?
[30:05.090 --> 30:07.330]  Oh, I'm up top on a drone shot right now, dude.
[30:07.350 --> 30:07.650]  Hell yeah.
[30:07.850 --> 30:08.470]  This looks sick.
[30:09.710 --> 30:10.750]  Me and Nick are out here dinging.
[30:10.750 --> 30:12.010]  Hold on, let me take a look here.
[30:12.310 --> 30:12.910]  You're already dinging?
[30:13.150 --> 30:14.890]  Nick, we're almost there. We're almost there. Why are you...
[30:14.890 --> 30:16.590]  I have an idea.
[30:17.630 --> 30:19.650]  What do you mean you have... What does that mean? You have an idea?
[30:19.970 --> 30:20.890]  We're almost there.
[30:23.010 --> 30:23.410]  Shit!
[30:24.110 --> 30:24.510]  Sorry!
[30:24.990 --> 30:25.910]  Gavin died, started over.
[30:28.570 --> 30:28.970]  Gavin!
[30:31.030 --> 30:34.090]  Someone is ripping me out of my vehicle as it stopped.
[30:34.650 --> 30:40.250]  There was, for some reason, a pileup on the road by Andrew, and I was going very fast on a bike.
[30:42.530 --> 30:43.970]  I'm at the dinghy.
[30:45.090 --> 30:45.510]  Okay.
[30:59.440 --> 31:01.180]  My personal vehicle has been destroyed.
[31:06.760 --> 31:11.460]  Nick was so excited that you were the bike and everything, and he was like, I got a plan, I got a plan.
[31:11.700 --> 31:12.680]  I guess that was the plan.
[31:12.960 --> 31:15.080]  Yeah, I was waiting for that the whole time.
[31:16.140 --> 31:17.020]  Andrew's coming backwards.
[31:18.680 --> 31:19.100]  True.
[31:23.440 --> 31:25.360]  Well, we've destroyed the evidence of our vehicle.
[31:26.480 --> 31:27.500]  Really done L.A.
[31:27.600 --> 31:28.260]  Let me get over there.
[31:28.840 --> 31:29.500]  Excuse me.
[31:29.760 --> 31:30.200]  Alright, we're in, boys.
[31:32.380 --> 31:33.100]  Vessel time!
[31:34.500 --> 31:35.740]  I love a good vessel.
[31:35.740 --> 31:38.800]  Oh my god, so far, we're like, is that like the middle of the ocean? That's the plan?
[31:39.140 --> 31:39.640]  This is crazy.
[31:39.920 --> 31:40.960]  You get your vessel yet, Gavin?
[31:41.740 --> 31:43.200]  Not yet. Maybe one day.
[31:46.360 --> 31:47.260]  Didn't Geoff own one?
[31:49.440 --> 31:51.000]  I don't think they ever existed.
[31:51.100 --> 31:51.200]  Oh.
[31:53.360 --> 31:55.340]  Oh, the drink. Right, right, right, the cup.
[31:59.180 --> 31:59.900]  We're slapping.
[32:00.200 --> 32:01.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:01.000 --> 32:02.180]  We're slapping that sea.
[32:04.060 --> 32:04.780]  Good god.
[32:05.620 --> 32:09.100]  Oh my god, I would hate being underwater if this is the experience.
[32:11.100 --> 32:11.820]  Jesus Christ!
[32:11.960 --> 32:14.320]  Gavin, is this that hour-long boat ride out to the other boat?
[32:16.040 --> 32:16.480]  Heh.
[32:20.340 --> 32:23.180]  I did an hour-long boat ride to a boat in the sea once.
[32:23.560 --> 32:25.060]  Yeah. Was it like this?
[32:27.100 --> 32:30.000]  Uh, it was like this, but with more people throwing up in my face.
[32:37.340 --> 32:38.700]  The sky looks cool.
[32:41.080 --> 32:44.820]  And then said person saying we can't use that in the show.
[32:45.260 --> 32:46.640]  What? Was it Drew?
[32:48.540 --> 32:48.980]  No.
[32:57.860 --> 32:59.380]  I'll get less choppy now.
[33:03.010 --> 33:05.690]  Alright, I'll stop leading the boat backwards and forwards.
[33:08.130 --> 33:08.570]  Whoa!
[33:10.850 --> 33:14.610]  Fly me to the danger zone.
[33:16.650 --> 33:19.110]  Did you say fly me to the danger zone?
[33:19.130 --> 33:20.390]  Yeah, yeah, fly me to the danger zone.
[33:20.730 --> 33:21.330]  Fly me right.
[33:21.690 --> 33:22.810]  Aren't those the words?
[33:22.810 --> 33:24.350]  Yeah, yeah, those are the words, Andrew, yeah.
[33:24.850 --> 33:27.490]  Yeah, fly me to the danger zone.
[33:27.870 --> 33:29.330]  It's like that other song, Highway to the Moon.
[33:37.290 --> 33:38.950]  Highway to the moon.
[33:39.590 --> 33:41.210]  Let me play.
[33:42.430 --> 33:43.270]  I'm on the stairs.
[33:50.130 --> 33:51.410]  What am I doing?
[33:52.810 --> 33:54.090]  Why am I like this?
[33:57.690 --> 33:58.090]  Andrew!
[33:59.330 --> 34:00.450]  Andrew, the boat.
[34:01.850 --> 34:04.110]  Okay, I'm dead. I had to get that out of my system.
[34:04.690 --> 34:05.090]  God.
[34:06.050 --> 34:07.070]  Alright, stealth mode.
[34:11.850 --> 34:13.890]  Take the stairs to the flight suppressor.
[34:13.990 --> 34:14.690]  What are we doing here?
[34:15.050 --> 34:15.310]  Gavin.
[34:15.450 --> 34:16.250]  Hello, boys!
[34:16.310 --> 34:18.150]  I was gonna say, Gavin, it's your call.
[34:19.950 --> 34:20.990]  I think it's no one's call now.
[34:21.130 --> 34:22.030]  I'm glad I equipped the silencer.
[34:26.170 --> 34:27.050]  They didn't.
[34:27.050 --> 34:30.530]  Oh, shit.
[34:36.300 --> 34:38.380]  The goal is to be louder than the alarm.
[34:43.800 --> 34:45.360]  They'll never know anything's wrong.
[34:45.540 --> 34:46.140]  That's really great.
[34:50.000 --> 34:50.540]  Ooh, body armor.
[34:54.980 --> 34:57.120]  Oh, this is a lot further...
[34:58.040 --> 34:59.140]  ...of a fight than I was expecting.
[34:59.180 --> 34:59.480]  ...than I thought it was.
[34:59.960 --> 35:00.360]  Let's go, Nick.
[35:00.840 --> 35:02.420]  Alright, I just was armoring up. Sorry.
[35:02.780 --> 35:03.300]  Yeah, yeah, I hear you.
[35:04.020 --> 35:05.720]  I'm going for platinum, baby!
[35:06.040 --> 35:06.400]  Do it.
[35:07.660 --> 35:08.640]  I'll watch your left here.
[35:08.680 --> 35:09.620]  Not if I can get it first!
[35:09.940 --> 35:11.260]  Nah, it's already mine.
[35:12.280 --> 35:12.580]  Oh, shit.
[35:12.580 --> 35:13.960]  I mean, someone else can have it. I don't want it.
[35:19.810 --> 35:20.210]  Got him.
[35:21.050 --> 35:21.370]  I...
[35:21.810 --> 35:22.630]  Don't even bother.
[35:22.850 --> 35:23.530]  I got him.
[35:26.570 --> 35:27.390]  Ooh, he had cash.
[35:33.270 --> 35:33.890]  Oh, shit!
[35:34.510 --> 35:35.030]  More guys.
[35:36.010 --> 35:37.250]  Oh, yeah, over here. Over here.
[35:39.370 --> 35:39.990]  Oh, I see.
[35:42.970 --> 35:43.330]  Oh!
[35:44.150 --> 35:45.510]  What the fuck happened to me?
[35:46.850 --> 35:47.710]  Did you get steamed?
[35:48.110 --> 35:49.170]  Did your face get steamed off?
[35:49.390 --> 35:50.450]  Oh, I'm getting steamed.
[35:50.870 --> 35:50.990]  Ah!
[35:52.090 --> 35:53.230]  Dammit, you stepped in front of me!
[35:53.290 --> 35:53.850]  I almost got me killed!
[35:58.870 --> 36:00.170]  Hey, how did Nick fall?
[36:00.810 --> 36:01.170]  Alright.
[36:01.650 --> 36:03.350]  Nick's our designated pilot, right?
[36:03.470 --> 36:03.930]  Nick, get the hydra.
[36:03.930 --> 36:04.390]  Roger that!
[36:04.390 --> 36:04.830]  Where is it?
[36:06.610 --> 36:06.930]  Alright.
[36:07.330 --> 36:08.270]  On my side to the left.
[36:08.350 --> 36:09.350]  Oh, Christ! Oh, shit!
[36:09.370 --> 36:10.190]  Gavin, I'm right behind you.
[36:12.050 --> 36:13.290]  I gotta... I gotta heal up.
[36:13.330 --> 36:14.090]  Nick's shooting at Andrew.
[36:14.210 --> 36:15.490]  Gotta heal up. There's a guy behind him.
[36:17.850 --> 36:18.310]  You're good.
[36:18.950 --> 36:19.510]  Hydra time, baby.
[36:19.670 --> 36:20.530]  Let's go, Nick. You got it.
[36:20.550 --> 36:20.930]  Hold on.
[36:21.250 --> 36:21.810]  Okay, go.
[36:21.990 --> 36:22.530]  This way, Nick.
[36:22.530 --> 36:22.990]  Alright, let's go.
[36:23.450 --> 36:23.630]  Ow.
[36:23.790 --> 36:24.890]  Oh, I'm in first person mode. Why?
[36:26.350 --> 36:27.410]  I don't... I don't know.
[36:27.470 --> 36:28.530]  Especially this deep in the video.
[36:28.610 --> 36:29.190]  Not a good idea.
[36:29.990 --> 36:30.310]  Whoops.
[36:30.650 --> 36:31.370]  Oh, my God.
[36:32.650 --> 36:34.250]  I'm taking out the other hydras.
[36:34.390 --> 36:35.510]  Is that what we need to do?
[36:35.710 --> 36:36.730]  I don't think so.
[36:36.790 --> 36:37.750]  I don't think so either.
[36:38.090 --> 36:38.790]  Up I go!
[36:39.690 --> 36:40.830]  Alright, you got it.
[36:41.330 --> 36:43.090]  Just, uh...
[36:43.090 --> 36:44.210]  Uh, who wants to hop on?
[36:44.290 --> 36:44.570]  Go, Nick!
[36:44.670 --> 36:45.890]  I'll go between the thrust and hover.
[36:45.890 --> 36:45.970]  No.
[36:46.710 --> 36:47.430]  There you go.
[36:47.690 --> 36:49.050]  It's written in the instruction manual.
[36:49.670 --> 36:50.050]  Hold.
[36:52.850 --> 36:53.430]  Go, Nick!
[36:53.550 --> 36:54.210]  You got it, Nick.
[36:54.430 --> 36:54.770]  Whee!
[36:55.950 --> 36:56.750]  Go, catch!
[36:58.950 --> 36:59.330]  Whoa!
[37:00.550 --> 37:02.290]  Take out... that's a lot of fighter jets.
[37:02.530 --> 37:02.590]  Oh!
[37:03.690 --> 37:05.650]  What are we supp...
[37:06.430 --> 37:08.030]  We gotta take out the fighter jets.
[37:08.150 --> 37:08.450]  How?
[37:08.570 --> 37:09.610]  Can we take out the hydras?
[37:10.270 --> 37:12.650]  Maybe you should have not blown up all the planes.
[37:12.670 --> 37:13.610]  That's what I'm saying!
[37:14.870 --> 37:15.310]  Guys?
[37:15.610 --> 37:16.570]  Some on this side.
[37:16.770 --> 37:17.690]  Yeah, there are other ones.
[37:18.310 --> 37:18.730]  Guys?
[37:19.090 --> 37:20.430]  Can you actually drive this?
[37:20.970 --> 37:21.350]  I don't know.
[37:22.390 --> 37:23.310]  We're about to find out.
[37:23.490 --> 37:23.850]  We're about to find out.
[37:23.910 --> 37:24.410]  Hell yeah!
[37:26.470 --> 37:27.130]  Shit, shit, shit.
[37:27.130 --> 37:27.790]  You can!
[37:27.790 --> 37:29.970]  Oh my god!
[37:30.230 --> 37:31.550]  It's good that you blew them all up.
[37:39.200 --> 37:39.780]  Hello.
[37:41.980 --> 37:43.600]  Special delivery, dickhead.
[37:43.760 --> 37:44.160]  Snacks.
[37:48.130 --> 37:48.990]  That's for you!
[37:49.430 --> 37:51.070]  What button is fire, Nick?
[37:52.430 --> 37:53.010]  Gavin!
[37:53.330 --> 37:53.910]  Gavin died.
[37:56.010 --> 37:56.810]  Gavin died.
[37:59.190 --> 37:59.870]  Gavin died.
[37:59.870 --> 38:00.330]  Hey, you know what?
[38:00.730 --> 38:02.070]  Now we can all have hydras.
[38:03.230 --> 38:03.570]  Yeah!
[38:05.050 --> 38:05.410]  Great.
[38:06.610 --> 38:07.750]  I'm gonna take the far one.
[38:08.230 --> 38:09.030]  I'll take the middle.
[38:09.310 --> 38:10.350]  I'll take the right one.
[38:10.570 --> 38:11.230]  Take the right.
[38:11.950 --> 38:12.430]  Oh, okay.
[38:12.430 --> 38:12.910]  The correct one.
[38:16.350 --> 38:21.520]  Alright, I'm jumping on.
[38:21.920 --> 38:24.680]  Since you blew up all the hydras before, Gavin, how did you do this?
[38:27.320 --> 38:27.680]  Alright.
[38:27.940 --> 38:29.520]  I assume you blew up the hydras every time?
[38:29.540 --> 38:30.800]  I'll let you go before me, Nick.
[38:30.960 --> 38:31.300]  Alright.
[38:36.380 --> 38:37.380]  Off we go!
[38:41.700 --> 38:43.740]  Hold Y to turn on homing for the missiles.
[38:43.880 --> 38:44.720]  Oh, what?
[38:45.220 --> 38:46.460]  You bastard!
[38:47.780 --> 38:50.140]  I can't believe I did that!
[38:50.820 --> 38:52.200]  God bless America!
[38:52.200 --> 38:52.560]  It worked!
[38:52.780 --> 38:54.560]  I can't believe it worked!
[38:55.580 --> 38:58.780]  I fell for your old-fashioned grass pit!
[38:59.020 --> 39:00.320]  Son of a bitch!
[39:01.100 --> 39:03.180]  I was so locked in!
[39:03.360 --> 39:04.440]  I was so locked in!
[39:04.460 --> 39:06.040]  I'm like, alright, this is gonna be like the mission.
[39:06.040 --> 39:07.740]  I feel so good about this.
[39:07.740 --> 39:09.580]  I can't believe I fucking fell for it.
[39:09.580 --> 39:11.200]  I cannot believe I fell for it.
[39:11.200 --> 39:12.600]  I feel so fucking stupid.
[39:12.920 --> 39:14.600]  How did you die?
[39:15.820 --> 39:19.480]  As soon as I launched, I held forward so I hit the water as hard as I could.
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.960]  That's the most up-doggin', here-ass fucking joke that I've ever heard.
[39:33.080 --> 39:34.680]  I'm like, damn, that's cool!
[39:34.680 --> 39:38.840]  I didn't know that's what jets were, because when I was flying the helicopter, it was just a different weapon.
[39:39.880 --> 39:40.600]  Jesus Christ.
[39:41.880 --> 39:45.580]  It makes me so happy that it's not just one of us, it's all of us.
[39:45.680 --> 39:48.180]  I can't believe it happened.
[39:49.020 --> 39:50.000]  Did it happen to all of us?
[39:50.160 --> 39:50.820]  No, but...
[39:51.580 --> 39:54.260]  I mean, it didn't happen to Nick, but did you do it, Gavin?
[39:54.820 --> 39:55.640]  Oh, big time.
[39:55.920 --> 39:56.960]  Okay, good, it's not just me.
[39:57.500 --> 39:59.820]  That makes me feel so much better, you have no idea.
[40:04.700 --> 40:05.780]  That felt good.
[40:07.800 --> 40:08.900]  Whoa, cool!
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.720]  Holy shit, Nick, that's cool!
[40:11.780 --> 40:12.300]  Isn't that awesome?
[40:14.560 --> 40:15.240]  Are you in VTOL?
[40:16.420 --> 40:17.960]  How do you change to that?
[40:19.000 --> 40:19.680]  You hold.
[40:20.780 --> 40:23.120]  You hold down the left stick.
[40:24.820 --> 40:27.080]  But I think you guys might just be in regular fighters.
[40:27.820 --> 40:28.640]  Yeah, we are.
[40:29.500 --> 40:30.460]  Oh, we're just in planes.
[40:30.460 --> 40:30.920]  Yeah.
[40:32.540 --> 40:34.500]  That explains why they keep saying One Hydra.
[40:35.960 --> 40:36.860]  Let's check it out.
[40:39.280 --> 40:40.240]  I'm stupid.
[40:42.280 --> 40:43.740]  Don't forget to hit Y to change to homing.
[40:50.740 --> 40:51.700]  What happened?
[40:53.320 --> 40:55.780]  I was trying to figure out how to fire my missile.
[40:56.240 --> 40:56.780]  That was sick.
[40:57.240 --> 40:58.000]  Oh, shit!
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.240]  I did the instinctual hit every button on the controller.
[41:02.600 --> 41:02.720]  Great.
[41:02.900 --> 41:04.260]  Wait, so you fell for it yourself?
[41:05.040 --> 41:06.860]  No, I'm parachuting into the sun.
[41:07.920 --> 41:10.000]  Dove out as soon as I locked on.
[41:11.620 --> 41:12.220]  Moron.
[41:13.520 --> 41:14.580]  It's okay, I'm gonna live.
[41:18.120 --> 41:19.680]  Oh my god!
[41:21.120 --> 41:22.720]  What the fuck?
[41:23.340 --> 41:23.940]  Gavin!
[41:24.600 --> 41:24.960]  Got him.
[41:29.220 --> 41:29.680]  Goose!
[41:31.140 --> 41:31.600]  Goose!
[41:34.640 --> 41:35.100]  Goose!
[41:35.440 --> 41:36.300]  Wow, I might drown.
[41:36.360 --> 41:37.160]  Oh my god.
[41:37.260 --> 41:38.340]  Are you all in the water?
[41:38.560 --> 41:38.780]  Yeah, I'm good.
[41:40.400 --> 41:43.880]  Well, I tried to hit Andrew off his parachute and he was already in the water.
[41:48.780 --> 41:50.280]  Do you have a knife?
[41:50.980 --> 41:51.400]  I'm on.
[41:51.820 --> 41:52.280]  Oh.
[41:54.120 --> 41:55.260]  I've got my swim knife.
[41:55.440 --> 41:55.860]  Knuckle dusters.
[41:56.160 --> 41:56.700]  Oh, fuck.
[41:57.180 --> 41:57.740]  Uh-oh.
[41:57.880 --> 42:00.020]  I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.
[42:03.400 --> 42:04.260]  Oh, who went down?
[42:06.660 --> 42:06.980]  Damn.
[42:07.200 --> 42:09.700]  I might be going down, I think my jet's going out.
[42:12.740 --> 42:13.940]  Swimming back to the carrier.
[42:14.540 --> 42:15.200]  Getting a new jet.
[42:15.400 --> 42:17.180]  There's one more fighter jet to take out?
[42:18.360 --> 42:18.640]  Yep.
[42:19.160 --> 42:19.600]  I got him.
[42:20.560 --> 42:21.000]  Okay, cool.
[42:21.800 --> 42:22.840]  Now we're... okay, now let's go to the...
[42:22.840 --> 42:23.400]  I need a lift.
[42:23.680 --> 42:24.540]  Let's go to the drop-off.
[42:24.900 --> 42:25.300]  Alright, bye.
[42:25.300 --> 42:27.360]  I think I can get you there, Nick.
[42:27.440 --> 42:27.700]  Okay.
[42:29.820 --> 42:30.740]  Yeah, we can swim, Gavin.
[42:31.340 --> 42:35.480]  I feel like Nick should VTOL down and we should get on the wings and then he should take us to safety.
[42:37.900 --> 42:39.880]  Nick, I think you can just take it to the drop-off point.
[42:39.880 --> 42:40.640]  Hold on, let's see where they are.
[42:41.500 --> 42:41.840]  What?
[42:43.700 --> 42:45.220]  We're very close together if that helps.
[42:46.860 --> 42:51.520]  Something about Nick in a plane, Gavin becomes a British siren.
[42:51.520 --> 42:57.640]  Yeah, I just like... it's like he just says... he hears a bad idea and he goes, that must have come from me.
[43:00.600 --> 43:03.180]  Here's the thing, you don't have to sing it, you can just say it.
[43:03.680 --> 43:05.320]  It appears that it just works on him.
[43:06.440 --> 43:09.420]  Oh, the most important siren call of all.
[43:11.140 --> 43:12.240]  Nick, where are you?
[43:12.340 --> 43:13.080]  I'm over these guys.
[43:14.080 --> 43:14.680]  He's above us.
[43:14.900 --> 43:15.820]  Oh, that's looking good, Nick.
[43:16.260 --> 43:19.000]  I'm gonna swing to the shore by the time that Nick gets there.
[43:20.260 --> 43:20.980]  Hold on.
[43:21.160 --> 43:22.220]  I see you, Eric.
[43:22.440 --> 43:23.000]  Hold on.
[43:23.240 --> 43:25.120]  There's fire coming out of my tail, dude.
[43:26.060 --> 43:26.900]  That's great.
[43:27.260 --> 43:27.740]  That's cool.
[43:27.960 --> 43:29.840]  I was hoping that Nick was just gonna beat this thing.
[43:30.160 --> 43:30.660]  I am.
[43:31.780 --> 43:32.620]  Oh, that's so close.
[43:33.880 --> 43:34.780]  Yes, I'm on.
[43:36.200 --> 43:36.980]  What happened?
[43:39.340 --> 43:40.360]  What happened, guys?
[43:40.660 --> 43:40.940]  It's not buoyant.
[43:43.280 --> 43:45.860]  Hey, I have other stuff to do today.
[43:45.860 --> 43:49.800]  If we have to do an hour of plane mission, I'm out.
[43:51.860 --> 43:53.880]  Wait, you didn't write it right off your whole day?
[43:54.020 --> 43:54.200]  No.
[43:56.560 --> 44:00.260]  For just a second, and as soon as it touched water, it just sank.
[44:00.580 --> 44:01.280]  It sank.
[44:04.260 --> 44:07.140]  Listen, I want everybody to fly with me this time.
[44:07.340 --> 44:08.340]  Don't leave me.
[44:09.000 --> 44:09.940]  Stop shooting my plane!
[44:12.480 --> 44:12.960]  Eric!
[44:16.240 --> 44:17.500]  Eric, what are you doing?
[44:19.200 --> 44:22.000]  Stop shooting the plane, you fucker!
[44:23.080 --> 44:24.960]  I'm getting out of here, you son of a bitch!
[44:26.020 --> 44:27.700]  I got hit by a plane!
[44:28.120 --> 44:29.680]  I got hit by a plane!
[44:34.680 --> 44:37.180]  Getting hit by a plane is so funny.
[44:37.420 --> 44:38.620]  It just comes out of nowhere.
[44:47.880 --> 44:48.560]  Oh, man.
[44:49.600 --> 44:51.980]  All right, we'll just have to play this Star Fox-ass mission again.
[44:52.140 --> 44:53.440]  Hey, man, Star Fox is a great game.
[44:53.440 --> 44:54.740]  This is fun and cool.
[44:55.160 --> 44:57.220]  Yes, it is. It's great. I'm having a fun time.
[44:57.300 --> 44:59.500]  I had a really good time the first time we did it.
[45:02.520 --> 45:03.460]  I'm locked in.
[45:09.020 --> 45:10.720]  Nice, nice, good work.
[45:12.400 --> 45:13.620]  Okay, one more time, boys.
[45:20.800 --> 45:22.000]  We're just...
[45:24.040 --> 45:25.880]  Again, would not be in this...
[45:25.880 --> 45:29.840]  This goes back to who fucked it on purpose.
[45:30.420 --> 45:31.860]  And it's the first one.
[45:32.120 --> 45:32.900]  And it's Nick.
[45:33.260 --> 45:36.640]  Everything that happens in this mission from here on out.
[45:36.840 --> 45:37.780]  A hundred percent.
[45:38.540 --> 45:39.300]  It's Nick.
[45:44.600 --> 45:46.600]  Your opinion doesn't really matter.
[45:46.800 --> 45:47.420]  I suppose not.
[45:48.940 --> 45:49.860]  Oh, shit.
[45:56.420 --> 45:57.500]  Guys, I'm a good pilot.
[46:00.340 --> 46:01.740]  You're not a bad pilot.
[46:02.140 --> 46:03.240]  That's not the problem.
[46:03.260 --> 46:05.400]  It's not your skill that anyone questions.
[46:05.820 --> 46:06.980]  None of it is skill-based.
[46:07.320 --> 46:07.700]  None.
[46:07.780 --> 46:08.740]  I don't know why you're mad.
[46:09.020 --> 46:11.840]  Your decision-making is piss-fucking poor.
[46:16.360 --> 46:19.100]  I'm just trying to pick my friends out of the water.
[46:20.860 --> 46:21.280]  Leave him.
[46:21.400 --> 46:22.040]  Let him drown.
[46:23.820 --> 46:24.620]  Oh, I'm hit.
[46:28.140 --> 46:45.940]  I think I've taken out three planes on this run.
[46:48.140 --> 46:49.760]  How many do you think you have to take out of the next one?
[46:53.220 --> 46:54.700]  I'm gonna kill you for real.
[46:55.080 --> 46:56.700]  I'm gonna kill you.
[46:59.980 --> 47:02.480]  Don't fly so close to that guy.
[47:09.830 --> 47:10.650]  This is out.
[47:11.310 --> 47:12.570]  Alright, I'm heading towards the end.
[47:12.590 --> 47:13.130]  Last one, I believe.
[47:13.370 --> 47:14.250]  Last one, there we go.
[47:14.350 --> 47:15.090]  Alright, let's drop it off.
[47:15.190 --> 47:15.410]  Alright.
[47:16.790 --> 47:18.170]  I'm gonna parachute into the water.
[47:18.290 --> 47:19.350]  Nick, you're gonna pick me up.
[47:19.450 --> 47:20.430]  Alright, I'll see you there.
[47:24.050 --> 47:25.610]  We'll land it, and then we'll...
[47:25.610 --> 47:27.230]  Let's at least figure out you guys wanna form up.
[47:29.450 --> 47:30.550]  I'll just turn off my afterburners.
[47:30.550 --> 47:31.890]  We should form up on the runway.
[47:32.230 --> 47:33.110]  I'll be on the left.
[47:33.890 --> 47:35.270]  Somebody can be behind on the right.
[47:35.470 --> 47:36.330]  Like, Nick can be in the front.
[47:36.830 --> 47:38.330]  I think that'll be...
[47:38.330 --> 47:39.730]  I'm slowing, I'm slowing.
[47:42.130 --> 47:42.890]  No, probably...
[47:43.440 --> 47:45.690]  Not like a super slow, I think...
[47:46.590 --> 47:48.010]  I think I'm faster than you.
[47:51.310 --> 47:53.530]  My radio started playing Highway to the Danger Zone.
[47:57.330 --> 47:58.770]  Fly me to the danger zone.
[47:59.070 --> 48:03.490]  Fly me to the danger zone.
[48:03.790 --> 48:05.110]  That's good, we can definitely sing that.
[48:05.350 --> 48:08.330]  Like, that's not copywritten because it's not the song.
[48:09.490 --> 48:12.610]  Take me to the air, everything is looking fine.
[48:17.350 --> 48:21.030]  Sitting in the back, chugging a big glass of wine.
[48:26.130 --> 48:27.530]  How you doing, Nick?
[48:29.910 --> 48:30.670]  What's happening?
[48:31.370 --> 48:31.730]  I'm hovering.
[48:33.190 --> 48:34.950]  Does it take a long time to hover?
[48:35.250 --> 48:35.370]  Yeah.
[48:36.630 --> 48:37.730]  I touched down.
[48:41.590 --> 48:42.610]  That's not what I wanted.
[48:46.710 --> 48:47.230]  Whoops!
[48:53.690 --> 48:55.750]  That looked incredible from my screen.
[48:56.710 --> 48:58.030]  Eric came in pretty hot there.
[48:58.110 --> 48:58.190]  He sure did.
[48:58.270 --> 48:58.950]  No, I'm good.
[49:01.170 --> 49:02.210]  Hold lights a puck.
[49:07.110 --> 49:08.130]  How you doing, Nick?
[49:08.630 --> 49:10.290]  I got to park in a barn, hold on.
[49:11.550 --> 49:12.470]  Alright, we got it.
[49:14.430 --> 49:14.730]  Yeah!
[49:15.190 --> 49:15.550]  Nice!
[49:17.170 --> 49:18.410]  Sorry I couldn't get you out of the water.
[49:23.960 --> 49:25.520]  Let me skip.
[49:27.560 --> 49:29.120]  Wow, what a good video.
[49:31.020 --> 49:33.700]  What a great video that was.
[49:34.500 --> 49:38.080]  Thank you so much for watching the setup of this heist.
[49:39.960 --> 49:41.860]  I think we should wrap up here.
[49:42.280 --> 49:42.500]  Yeah.
[49:42.660 --> 49:44.360]  Pick up where we left off.
[49:44.880 --> 49:46.920]  I can't skip this man.
[49:49.300 --> 49:51.080]  But what's exciting,
[49:51.660 --> 49:53.040]  is we're going to do more of these.
[49:53.540 --> 49:54.980]  We're immediately going to pick this back up.
[49:55.120 --> 49:57.680]  You'll see another video soon, I hope, of this.
[49:57.860 --> 49:59.620]  But if you want to fill that time between,
[50:00.020 --> 50:01.780]  check out our podcast, Regulation Pod.
[50:02.300 --> 50:04.800]  Check out our Patreon, the Regulation Pod,
[50:05.340 --> 50:08.180]  there, social media, all that stuff.
[50:09.040 --> 50:10.000]  Thanks for watching.
[50:11.300 --> 50:11.500]  Bye!
[50:12.360 --> 50:12.800]  Bye.
[50:13.480 --> 50:14.920]  Past, thank fucking God.
[50:15.020 --> 50:15.460]  Bronze!
[50:15.500 --> 50:16.620]  Platinum! I knew it.
