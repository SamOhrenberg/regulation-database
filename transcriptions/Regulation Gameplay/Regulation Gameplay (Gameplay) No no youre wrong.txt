[00:00.000 --> 00:01.440]  What is Maybelline?
[00:01.680 --> 00:02.280]  Is that a butter?
[00:03.120 --> 00:03.680]  Butter?
[00:04.700 --> 00:05.620]  Hang on.
[00:07.500 --> 00:09.160]  Spread some Maybelline on toast?
[00:09.340 --> 00:09.880]  I just don't remember.
[00:10.620 --> 00:13.580]  In my head I was thinking maybe a cream cheese.
[00:13.940 --> 00:15.080]  I just remember the slogan.
[00:15.260 --> 00:16.720]  I don't remember anything else about the product.
[00:16.900 --> 00:19.300]  Maybe she's born with cream cheese?
[00:19.920 --> 00:21.480]  Maybe it's cream cheese?
[00:21.760 --> 00:23.280]  I just thought maybe it's Maybelline.
[00:23.380 --> 00:24.080]  That's all I remembered.
[00:24.300 --> 00:26.760]  It's probably the most unsure slogan.
[00:28.640 --> 00:30.080]  Maybe she's born with it?
[00:30.200 --> 00:31.280]  Or maybe it's the slogan?
[00:31.280 --> 00:32.440]  Yeah, we haven't identified
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.700]  whether she's naturally very beautiful
[00:34.700 --> 00:36.220]  and her hair looks amazing.
[00:36.380 --> 00:37.400]  Or if it's Maybelline.
[00:37.540 --> 00:39.400]  We won't spoil it here.
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.120]  We won't figure it out in this ad. Bye.
[00:42.260 --> 00:43.820]  Yeah, we won't spoil it.
[00:44.300 --> 00:44.860]  No spoilers.
[00:45.440 --> 00:46.480]  We won't tell you if it's Maybelline.
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.200]  If it was maybe she's born with it, no.
[00:49.600 --> 00:51.120]  No, you're wrong. It's Maybelline.
[00:52.280 --> 00:55.120]  I think it's less catchy if it's
[00:55.120 --> 00:56.140]  No, no, you're wrong.
[00:56.520 --> 00:57.480]  In the middle?
[00:58.380 --> 00:59.800]  No, no, you're wrong.
