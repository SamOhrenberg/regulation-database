[00:00.000 --> 00:00.780]  It's an Xbox.
[00:01.240 --> 00:02.100]  It's an Xbox!
[00:03.060 --> 00:03.740]  Everything's an Xbox.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.660]  Ahoy! I have a bird now!
[00:06.960 --> 00:09.060]  He's flying on my arm. Look at him go.
[00:09.220 --> 00:10.800]  He's flying. Look at him. He's powerful.
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.960]  Can I show you a little secret? The bird, Eric?
[00:13.100 --> 00:13.440]  Yeah.
[00:13.700 --> 00:14.540]  A little secret? Okay.
[00:14.840 --> 00:16.560]  Please. Hold left trigger so I can...
[00:16.560 --> 00:17.860]  Okay. Here he is.
[00:17.940 --> 00:18.320]  No!
[00:19.420 --> 00:22.380]  What I like to do is you go there and then you see him out and they go...
[00:22.380 --> 00:23.080]  What? No!
[00:23.080 --> 00:25.260]  They really start flying. They get some good distance.
[00:25.640 --> 00:27.060]  They're gonna scout for us.
[00:28.860 --> 00:29.680]  Did you kill the bird?
[00:29.680 --> 00:31.060]  No, they'll be back.
[00:31.820 --> 00:32.220]  What did you do?
[00:32.900 --> 00:33.680]  Did he just kill you, bud?
[00:34.100 --> 00:34.980]  He's gone!
[00:35.620 --> 00:36.320]  He'll be back!
[00:36.700 --> 00:37.860]  He shot him into the sky!
[00:38.120 --> 00:40.400]  He always finds his way. He'll be back.
[00:40.600 --> 00:42.020]  He used the cannon, Geoff!
[00:42.120 --> 00:43.140]  Geoff, he used the cannon!
[00:43.480 --> 00:46.400]  Whoa, what if we shot a ship with the bird?
[00:46.860 --> 00:47.800]  I don't want to!
[00:47.960 --> 00:49.760]  No! We have cannonballs.
[00:50.400 --> 00:52.100]  We have to know. Maybe it's like a trick.
[00:52.260 --> 00:53.300]  You can get it in one hit.
[00:53.960 --> 00:55.320]  Why are you huffing? He'll be back.
[00:55.880 --> 00:57.500]  An insta-sync with the bird?
[00:58.200 --> 01:00.220]  I'm gonna make a proclamation right now.
[01:00.460 --> 01:00.940]  Okay.
[01:01.460 --> 01:04.040]  Xbox, you have to pay us for this video.
[01:04.660 --> 01:06.760]  We made the USS Xbox.
[01:07.680 --> 01:09.140]  You have to pay us for this video.
[01:09.360 --> 01:11.760]  If you don't pay us, this video will never come out.
[01:13.440 --> 01:14.400]  Alright, well...
[01:14.400 --> 01:17.080]  That does not mean that when this video comes out,
[01:17.160 --> 01:18.000]  that they paid us.
[01:18.160 --> 01:19.960]  If this video is released,
[01:20.080 --> 01:21.540]  it can only mean one thing, fellas.
[01:22.240 --> 01:24.400]  Microsoft paid us one billion dollars.
[01:24.620 --> 01:25.100]  Wow!
[01:25.100 --> 01:27.040]  I'll take the money from Rare.
[01:27.160 --> 01:28.360]  We'll take it from Rare. I don't care.
[01:29.240 --> 01:31.000]  Give me this stupid fish.
[01:32.480 --> 01:33.840]  Is there a trick to fishing, Geoff?
[01:34.600 --> 01:34.960]  Yeah.
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.180]  You go against the direction it's going.
[01:38.640 --> 01:40.520]  And when it starts to vibrate too much,
[01:40.580 --> 01:41.480]  you step off.
[01:41.580 --> 01:42.420]  I've been hearing that.
[01:42.540 --> 01:43.580]  Two very important tricks.
[01:43.740 --> 01:46.160]  If you didn't have somebody who knew the tricks to tell you,
[01:46.160 --> 01:46.960]  you wouldn't figure it out.
[01:47.060 --> 01:49.320]  Thank you for telling me the tricks when I asked you the first time.
[01:49.720 --> 01:51.480]  Instead of telling me there are no tricks.
[01:51.480 --> 01:52.800]  I really appreciate it, personally.
[01:53.260 --> 01:54.100]  I'm just happy to help.
[01:54.320 --> 01:55.720]  A guy like me just needs the help.
[01:56.220 --> 01:56.780]  Got a fish!
[01:58.220 --> 01:59.640]  I use the tricks.
[02:00.500 --> 02:01.700]  You use fish tricks?
[02:02.220 --> 02:03.880]  Yeah, I got a Ruby Splashtail.
[02:04.120 --> 02:04.920]  That's pretty cool, dude.
[02:05.100 --> 02:06.800]  Do you have any tricks to start this car?
[02:06.960 --> 02:09.260]  Yeah, you gotta put a key in the ignition and then turn it.
[02:09.340 --> 02:10.120]  That's a good trick.
[02:10.680 --> 02:14.480]  No, but a trick to start the car would be you have to put your foot on the brake while you turn the ignition.
[02:15.260 --> 02:18.420]  Oh, or give it a little gas each time?
[02:18.440 --> 02:18.680]  Yeah.
[02:19.940 --> 02:20.940]  Hit the clutch.
[02:22.040 --> 02:22.860]  Who has a clutch?
[02:22.940 --> 02:24.240]  Andrew, thought on any of these tricks?
[02:25.720 --> 02:26.460]  You know what a clutch is?
[02:26.720 --> 02:30.240]  I read, Nick, that the last car...
[02:30.240 --> 02:31.960]  Oh, I forgot you can come and cook up my fish real fast.
[02:32.420 --> 02:36.760]  The last car to come with the manual transmission just got phased out.
[02:37.100 --> 02:37.520]  Wow, really?
[02:37.960 --> 02:39.460]  Yeah, it was a Hyundai or something.
[02:39.520 --> 02:40.440]  It was the final one, maybe.
[02:40.600 --> 02:41.320]  Maybe it wasn't a Hyundai.
[02:41.400 --> 02:41.820]  Maybe it was a Honda.
[02:41.980 --> 02:42.940]  It was some car, though.
[02:43.280 --> 02:46.020]  They only had one model left that you could still buy in manual.
[02:46.020 --> 02:49.020]  And they've just, according to 2026, they're getting rid of it.
[02:49.420 --> 02:49.740]  Wow.
[02:49.740 --> 02:53.020]  You cannot buy a new car, consumer car, in manual.
[02:53.580 --> 02:54.160]  That's crazy.
[02:54.520 --> 02:55.220]  At least not in the States.
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.740]  Do people get seasick playing this game?
[02:59.100 --> 02:59.540]  Oh, yeah.
[02:59.940 --> 03:01.940]  I'm just watching it.
[03:02.060 --> 03:04.120]  I started getting a little like, oh, I need to look at something.
[03:05.060 --> 03:06.240]  Oh, why did you say that?
[03:07.780 --> 03:08.600]  Yeah, where is it?
[03:09.020 --> 03:09.500]  It's in my hand.
[03:09.860 --> 03:10.580]  I don't know where you are, though.
[03:10.620 --> 03:11.420]  Oh, I'm above you.
[03:12.260 --> 03:12.900]  Oh, wow.
[03:13.020 --> 03:13.600]  That's neat.
[03:14.520 --> 03:16.920]  Are you just eating a fish?
[03:17.340 --> 03:17.960]  It's gone.
[03:18.440 --> 03:19.340]  Can you see my fish scales?
[03:20.340 --> 03:22.380]  Here, check this out.
[03:23.880 --> 03:25.780]  I can put on a little sailor chest disguise.
[03:26.500 --> 03:28.060]  And then they're like, oh, you're a chest?
[03:28.220 --> 03:29.520]  Oh, shit.
[03:29.600 --> 03:32.160]  Can I pick you up as a chest?
[03:32.180 --> 03:33.000]  No, I don't think so.
[03:33.080 --> 03:34.340]  Watch this.
[03:35.360 --> 03:36.000]  I can go in.
[03:37.520 --> 03:39.620]  Stop bumping me. I'm getting bumped.
[03:39.620 --> 03:40.980]  No one's touching you.
[03:41.340 --> 03:43.020]  When I go to pick him up, it gets him out.
[03:44.320 --> 03:46.100]  When you go to pick him up, it gets him out of it.
[03:46.280 --> 03:46.560]  Okay.
[03:47.220 --> 03:47.580]  Stop!
[03:49.120 --> 03:49.920]  Never mind.
[03:51.180 --> 03:54.180]  We got a bunch of fucking Rodney Mullins on this boat.
[03:54.520 --> 03:55.780]  It's trick city.
[03:58.680 --> 04:01.420]  Andrew doesn't like to share his tricks, so...
[04:01.420 --> 04:02.420]  I was trying!
[04:02.860 --> 04:03.540]  Oh, man.
[04:04.260 --> 04:06.420]  Hey, Microsoft, if you're gonna pay us for this video,
[04:06.540 --> 04:08.180]  can you give me some animals?
[04:08.180 --> 04:09.760]  Can I have pets? Can I have a pig?
[04:10.100 --> 04:11.740]  I want a pig. I want the cinnamon pig.
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.020]  And I want the mocha marmoset.
[04:16.440 --> 04:17.700]  And a million dollars.
[04:17.800 --> 04:19.360]  And a million dollars.
[04:19.480 --> 04:20.760]  Not in-game currency.
[04:20.980 --> 04:21.580]  U.S. currency.
[04:21.840 --> 04:23.960]  And a billion sky miles.
[04:24.600 --> 04:26.020]  Or euros. I'll take it in euro.
[04:27.280 --> 04:28.380]  Is that the dinner bell?
[04:30.980 --> 04:31.860]  Soup's on!
[04:35.140 --> 04:37.080]  Alright, so what are we doing in this...
[04:37.080 --> 04:39.620]  We're headed to the skull of the sky!
[04:39.940 --> 04:40.680]  The what?
[04:41.280 --> 04:42.580]  Oh, it's over there!
[04:43.280 --> 04:43.740]  In the sky?
[04:43.920 --> 04:45.520]  In the sky. Okay.
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.440]  We're heading there, and then we're gonna have to fight a bunch of guys.
[04:49.640 --> 04:51.020]  Are you playing Happy Birthday?
[04:52.000 --> 04:52.640]  I believe so.
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.720]  Probably. Let me see.
[04:54.840 --> 04:57.300]  What if I do...
[04:57.300 --> 04:57.540]  This one.
[04:57.600 --> 04:57.860]  Ow!
[04:58.220 --> 05:02.400]  Are we playing the same song?
[05:03.480 --> 05:05.740]  Yeah, it automatically syncs.
[05:05.740 --> 05:06.280]  Cool.
[05:07.520 --> 05:08.960]  Get a banjo in here.
[05:09.100 --> 05:10.500]  Nothing better than when you get everybody going.
[05:11.560 --> 05:13.600]  Oh, Andrew has like a ghost instrument.
[05:14.600 --> 05:16.060]  It's making me dizzy.
[05:16.320 --> 05:16.720]  Like the sea.
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.200]  Okay. Nick decided to...
[05:21.200 --> 05:23.160]  Nick decided to copy Geoff.
[05:23.740 --> 05:24.160]  Oh, that's okay.
[05:24.220 --> 05:25.040]  God dang it!
[05:25.520 --> 05:26.420]  This isn't a draft.
[05:27.260 --> 05:29.300]  I'm playing that. You're copying me.
[05:30.980 --> 05:32.780]  There are so many instruments, aren't there?
[05:33.280 --> 05:34.180]  I'll be on vocals.
[05:35.920 --> 05:36.440]  Okay.
[05:36.680 --> 05:38.460]  Going to the barnacle store!
[05:39.320 --> 05:41.700]  Got a bunch of barnacles at the barnacle store!
[05:42.800 --> 05:44.240]  Now you're both on...
[05:45.360 --> 05:47.040]  Living a sea wave dream!
[05:47.780 --> 05:48.940]  Got the feel of the fish!
[05:49.200 --> 05:50.260]  Through the veins!
[06:00.500 --> 06:02.040]  That was pretty cool.
[06:03.100 --> 06:04.620]  See, I got mine. It looks like a parrot.
[06:04.620 --> 06:05.500]  See that, Nick?
[06:06.220 --> 06:07.260]  Oh, wow! I love it!
[06:08.320 --> 06:10.260]  Say something to me in parrot.
[06:10.320 --> 06:10.720]  Okay, ready?
[06:14.540 --> 06:16.140]  Is that good? Did it come through loud and clear?
[06:16.860 --> 06:18.220]  No, it cut out, but that's fine.
[06:19.600 --> 06:20.200]  Ooh, drink!
[06:20.400 --> 06:22.380]  I'm drinking ale? Or what's happening?
[06:23.120 --> 06:24.520]  Hey, have you seen mine? Take a look at this.
[06:24.580 --> 06:25.620]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[06:27.520 --> 06:28.540]  It already makes the noise.
[06:30.100 --> 06:30.940]  I'm going to make my own.
[06:31.460 --> 06:32.380]  Okay, so what happens...
[06:32.380 --> 06:34.080]  Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
[06:34.380 --> 06:34.960]  Yeah, sure.
[06:35.180 --> 06:37.220]  Have you guys ever considered not drinking?
[06:39.120 --> 06:40.420]  Just a thought.
[06:42.360 --> 06:44.480]  Geoff watching us do it while holding a parrot.
[06:44.620 --> 06:44.880]  Get him!
[06:45.180 --> 06:45.460]  Get him!
[06:49.260 --> 06:50.140]  Stop it!
[06:51.460 --> 06:52.660]  You've got a problem!
[06:52.960 --> 06:53.980]  You guys ever consider not drinking?
[06:53.980 --> 06:55.040]  Am I drunk?
[06:55.800 --> 06:56.660]  Yeah, you're drunk.
[06:57.720 --> 07:00.480]  I'm like trying to walk around and I'm like, dude, what the fuck?
[07:01.220 --> 07:02.560]  How's it helping your seasickness?
[07:02.700 --> 07:04.860]  No, it's not good. I'm like 2015 Geoff. This is bad.
[07:05.560 --> 07:06.700]  I was always seasick.
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.460]  Guys, I'm seasick today.
[07:10.300 --> 07:11.540]  I don't know if I can play GTA.
[07:11.720 --> 07:12.520]  I'm really seasick.
[07:14.340 --> 07:16.140]  Got caught some seasick at lunch.
[07:21.320 --> 07:27.060]  I'm going to have to go lay down in the conference room.
[07:28.540 --> 07:29.180]  Oh, shit!
[07:29.940 --> 07:30.760]  Oh, fuck me.
[07:31.520 --> 07:36.840]  God, this is making... I can't...
[07:36.840 --> 07:38.260]  Dude, I don't know if I can play this fucking game.
[07:38.520 --> 07:40.400]  I don't really get seasick.
[07:40.520 --> 07:42.560]  I've been deep sea fishing. I don't really get seasick.
[07:43.920 --> 07:45.700]  It's funny because we played it last week
[07:45.700 --> 07:46.740]  for like an hour and a half.
[07:46.820 --> 07:47.520]  You didn't get sick at all.
[07:47.700 --> 07:48.640]  No, I don't know what...
[07:50.280 --> 07:51.500]  Where's my parrot?
[07:53.540 --> 07:54.100]  What parrot?
[07:54.820 --> 07:55.600]  Do you have my parrot?
[07:56.340 --> 07:56.520]  No.
[07:57.420 --> 07:58.880]  You can hang out with him. That's fine.
[07:59.560 --> 08:01.540]  Is this the parrot that Andrew shot?
[08:01.660 --> 08:02.780]  No, Nick, don't do it.
[08:02.860 --> 08:02.980]  No!
[08:04.880 --> 08:08.540]  Oh, he discovered new layouting.
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.100]  You know, you can get in...
[08:11.100 --> 08:12.340]  We can put you in the cannon, Nick.
[08:12.400 --> 08:12.820]  That'd be fun.
[08:13.800 --> 08:15.000]  Whose bird is this?
[08:16.840 --> 08:17.500]  That might be...
[08:18.280 --> 08:20.180]  Oh, that's my favorite game show.
[08:20.520 --> 08:22.340]  Whose bird is this?
[08:24.100 --> 08:26.520]  This bird is missing all its feathers.
[08:27.920 --> 08:29.160]  This bird's a lizard.
[08:29.700 --> 08:30.240]  He's the...
[08:31.660 --> 08:33.320]  He's the A.A. macaw.
[08:33.600 --> 08:34.780]  He comes in to...
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.900]  He shows up in Seafarer's final piece
[08:39.900 --> 08:41.580]  to let them know that there's another way.
[08:42.040 --> 08:43.760]  I fell off the boat, so...
[08:43.760 --> 08:44.160]  Geoff!
[08:45.100 --> 08:46.860]  You fell off the boat?
[08:47.860 --> 08:49.080]  Alright, I'll catch the mermaid.
[08:49.680 --> 08:51.680]  What? Catch the mermaid.
[08:51.680 --> 08:52.740]  There she is.
[08:53.160 --> 08:55.580]  If you get far away from a boat, a mermaid spawns,
[08:55.600 --> 08:57.200]  and you can use them to go back to the boat.
[08:58.060 --> 09:00.720]  Man, I'm a lot more forgiving in this realm.
[09:01.040 --> 09:03.000]  Hey, we're coming up on the skull island.
[09:03.320 --> 09:03.780]  Okay, cool.
[09:03.960 --> 09:05.920]  I'll make sure a parrot is ready to get loaded
[09:05.920 --> 09:06.760]  and shot out of a cannon.
[09:07.560 --> 09:07.900]  Excellent.
[09:09.460 --> 09:10.640]  Oh, my God, guys.
[09:10.880 --> 09:11.540]  This is...
[09:13.040 --> 09:13.940]  Stormy seas, huh?
[09:14.060 --> 09:15.360]  It's okay, we're almost off the ship.
[09:15.400 --> 09:17.480]  Goddamn, I don't know why it's making me so seasick.
[09:17.480 --> 09:19.360]  Oh, wow, look, a skull got glowy eyes.
[09:19.440 --> 09:19.880]  That was cool.
[09:20.500 --> 09:23.840]  If you think this is making you seasick, wait till we play griffball later.
[09:24.060 --> 09:24.680]  Oh, no.
[09:26.200 --> 09:28.120]  There's nothing on, like, these little islands?
[09:29.160 --> 09:29.900]  Uh, there probably is.
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.060]  There's missions to each one of them.
[09:31.200 --> 09:33.580]  Yeah, absolutely, but we're just going to a specific thing.
[09:34.480 --> 09:35.480]  Half of this game...
[09:35.480 --> 09:37.740]  We're doing a specific thing, but half of this game is getting a mission
[09:37.740 --> 09:40.080]  and then staring at the map, trying to figure out
[09:40.080 --> 09:40.660]  where the fuck it is.
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.300]  You son of a bitch! You just turned the shit out of us!
[09:43.780 --> 09:44.240]  Who did that?
[09:44.240 --> 09:46.280]  Yeah, Geoff, what are you doing?
[09:46.780 --> 09:49.420]  Ahoy! Some stuff coming up on the side, boys.
[09:50.040 --> 09:51.460]  Oh, we could do, like, a cool...
[09:51.460 --> 09:51.600]  Oh!
[09:53.220 --> 09:53.980]  Do I...
[09:53.980 --> 09:55.120]  Oh, you dropped it!
[09:55.300 --> 09:56.600]  What am I supposed to do?
[09:57.840 --> 10:00.840]  You pull it up and then you hop off the harpoon
[10:00.840 --> 10:01.880]  and push X on it.
[10:02.080 --> 10:04.420]  Oh, that wasn't how we did it when we had all the treasure.
[10:05.180 --> 10:05.580]  No.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.900]  The treasure just gets loaded onto the boat.
[10:08.220 --> 10:10.840]  Right, so you can see why I thought that maybe it would act the same.
[10:11.340 --> 10:11.620]  Absolutely.
[10:11.620 --> 10:13.660]  Yeah, here we go. Coming in.
[10:14.480 --> 10:15.780]  I don't think anybody's judging you.
[10:15.840 --> 10:17.220]  The island. Skull Island.
[10:19.800 --> 10:20.880]  We're not judging you.
[10:20.940 --> 10:23.000]  We just acknowledge that you have a problem.
[10:24.560 --> 10:25.400]  I don't have a problem.
[10:25.480 --> 10:26.500]  I can stop anytime.
[10:26.880 --> 10:27.220]  It's not a problem.
[10:27.240 --> 10:30.540]  At the end of the day, we just care about you.
[10:30.700 --> 10:32.140]  Where did Bill W. go?
[10:32.380 --> 10:34.020]  There's a cannonball!
[10:35.360 --> 10:36.020]  Look out!
[10:36.400 --> 10:38.140]  Ah! What the hell was that?
[10:38.540 --> 10:39.000]  We're hit!
[10:40.260 --> 10:41.280]  What's going on?
[10:41.620 --> 10:42.980]  Why are we getting hit?
[10:43.380 --> 10:45.540]  The AI. They're shooting at us.
[10:46.060 --> 10:46.660]  Yeah, they are.
[10:47.240 --> 10:48.600]  See you guys later. I'm going downstairs.
[10:49.480 --> 10:50.040]  Me too!
[10:52.160 --> 10:53.160]  Wait, what the hell?
[10:53.800 --> 10:55.620]  There's no... Oh my god, we don't have any cannonballs
[10:55.620 --> 10:56.200]  loaded up.
[10:56.800 --> 10:59.140]  We don't have any wood loaded up either.
[10:59.400 --> 11:00.520]  We got holes. I got wood.
[11:00.940 --> 11:02.240]  We got holes. I got wood.
[11:03.040 --> 11:03.720]  Yeah, baby.
[11:05.380 --> 11:07.020]  Sorry, I got scare excited.
[11:07.020 --> 11:07.860]  Nick's got worms.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.460]  Worms? I got worms.
[11:13.280 --> 11:15.140]  I need to watch Dumb and Dumber again.
[11:15.760 --> 11:18.020]  Feel free to hop off the boat and start attacking skeletons.
[11:19.000 --> 11:19.500]  Sounds good.
[11:21.080 --> 11:21.800]  You got it.
[11:22.980 --> 11:24.620]  What should I attack skeletons with?
[11:25.340 --> 11:26.460]  Guns and swords.
[11:28.180 --> 11:29.940]  Are we going there or to the
[11:29.940 --> 11:31.120]  big tall lookout building?
[11:31.660 --> 11:32.660]  Just anywhere on the island.
[11:33.160 --> 11:34.180]  You got it!
[11:34.180 --> 11:35.800]  You wish you did. That was me, baby.
[11:36.320 --> 11:37.700]  You wish you did. That was me, baby.
[11:39.020 --> 11:40.620]  I wish I did. It wasn't me, baby.
[11:41.300 --> 11:42.340]  Avast ye sea dogs.
[11:43.200 --> 11:45.340]  I need some food. Anybody see any food? Uh oh.
[11:49.480 --> 11:50.020]  Die, prick!
[11:51.260 --> 11:52.640]  Yeah! Wow, the hold button
[11:52.640 --> 11:54.040]  really takes a long time, doesn't it?
[11:55.880 --> 11:56.200]  Hold?
[11:56.240 --> 11:58.960]  The hold button? Yeah, like if you hold the...
[11:58.960 --> 11:59.480]  Hold?
[12:00.360 --> 12:02.240]  It's like trying to sell a car. I'm Carvana.
[12:02.240 --> 12:03.720]  You're married to Dax Shepard.
[12:03.960 --> 12:04.400]  Hold?
[12:06.680 --> 12:08.060]  Got some skeletons near me.
[12:08.760 --> 12:10.680]  Can I only swim for like a certain amount of time?
[12:10.780 --> 12:11.500]  Or how does it work?
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.420]  You can swim as long as you want.
[12:15.040 --> 12:15.160]  Okay.
[12:16.080 --> 12:17.900]  Give a limited time underwater.
[12:18.480 --> 12:21.140]  Ah, much like real life.
[12:22.860 --> 12:24.640]  Swim all you want, just remember to be
[12:24.640 --> 12:25.160]  above water.
[12:27.100 --> 12:28.440]  Almost too long that time.
[12:28.440 --> 12:30.000]  Nom nom nom.
[12:30.360 --> 12:32.320]  Nom nom nom.
[12:33.060 --> 12:34.560]  There are coconuts in here.
[12:34.720 --> 12:35.920]  Delicious coconuts.
[12:36.200 --> 12:38.680]  Oh, they're in the fort. They're spawning in the fort.
[12:38.860 --> 12:40.400]  They're spawning in the fort. Don't worry.
[12:40.520 --> 12:42.340]  I'm a straight up assassin.
[12:42.840 --> 12:43.920]  Oh, that's pretty cool actually.
[12:46.900 --> 12:48.580]  Ho ho ho! Yo ho.
[12:53.380 --> 12:54.220]  Oh, hello.
[12:55.200 --> 12:55.980]  Where'd you come from?
[12:56.100 --> 12:57.120]  Where the fuck am I?
[12:58.000 --> 12:58.940]  Oh, Nick!
[12:59.360 --> 13:00.800]  What are they doing?
[13:02.780 --> 13:04.380]  Somebody pick me up.
[13:04.460 --> 13:08.200]  I have no idea what killed me.
[13:09.440 --> 13:09.920]  No.
[13:10.600 --> 13:13.680]  You shot the TNT and it caused a chain of explosions.
[13:14.100 --> 13:14.740]  Oh, are you guys down?
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.520]  Yeah, we're all down.
[13:17.880 --> 13:20.040]  I just tried to recover Nick and he was gone.
[13:20.440 --> 13:21.780]  Goodbye, my friend.
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.040]  Thanks for nothing, Nick.
[13:23.880 --> 13:25.180]  Nick, you've got a problem.
[13:26.700 --> 13:27.160]  Listen,
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.020]  I can quit anytime I want.
[13:30.640 --> 13:31.160]  You can't.
[13:31.200 --> 13:32.860]  We should put Nick in the brig after this.
[13:33.360 --> 13:35.540]  No! Nick's got a murder problem.
[13:35.800 --> 13:36.520]  There we go. No!
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.980]  I didn't know that you can't be that close.
[13:41.480 --> 13:42.640]  Are you dead? Yeah.
[13:43.720 --> 13:44.900]  How do I get through the door?
[13:45.500 --> 13:47.700]  You can hold Y to respawn, Eric.
[13:48.140 --> 13:49.560]  Yeah. That's the trick.
[13:50.580 --> 13:51.340]  Walking through doors?
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.140]  Holding Y to respawn.
[13:53.720 --> 13:54.540]  Hey, what's up, guys?
[13:56.160 --> 13:57.780]  Oh, wow. It takes a while
[13:57.780 --> 13:58.740]  for that door to open, huh?
[13:59.480 --> 13:59.820]  It sure does.
[14:01.140 --> 14:02.580]  That's the annoying part about dying.
[14:04.540 --> 14:05.260]  Gold skeletons.
[14:06.480 --> 14:07.840]  I didn't know that TNT
[14:07.840 --> 14:08.780]  had that big of a range.
[14:09.360 --> 14:11.560]  Hey, I did the exact same thing you did, Nick.
[14:11.980 --> 14:13.080]  Okay, sweet. Hey, listen.
[14:13.460 --> 14:14.440]  All is forgiven to me.
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.280]  I'm sorry. What?
[14:18.440 --> 14:19.000]  All is forgiven.
[14:20.040 --> 14:21.260]  Nick is all forgiven.
[14:21.260 --> 14:23.200]  Alright, guys. Everyone forgives me.
[14:23.300 --> 14:25.800]  You're welcome. I'm here to help.
[14:26.660 --> 14:28.100]  You're welcome, guys.
[14:28.540 --> 14:29.600]  Everyone forgives me.
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.820]  I've been forgiven. Just FYI.
[14:33.400 --> 14:33.960]  Ow!
[14:34.040 --> 14:35.340]  What the hell was that?
[14:35.440 --> 14:37.000]  I just want to let everyone know I am forgiven.
[14:37.780 --> 14:38.500]  I'm on fire.
[14:39.400 --> 14:40.160]  That blew up.
[14:40.640 --> 14:41.180]  That wasn't me.
[14:45.260 --> 14:47.180]  Andrew's being deceptively quiet.
[14:47.180 --> 14:47.600]  Ah!
[14:49.500 --> 14:50.460]  Little fire.
[14:51.100 --> 14:53.180]  Who did that? Was that Andrew?
[14:53.480 --> 14:54.020]  Yeah, it sounds like Andrew.
[14:55.340 --> 14:55.680]  Ah!
[14:56.380 --> 14:56.860]  Ah!
[14:59.060 --> 15:00.380]  Oh my God!
[15:01.040 --> 15:02.460]  It just came out of nowhere!
[15:03.960 --> 15:05.620]  Get back! Get away!
[15:06.540 --> 15:07.000]  Die, prick!
[15:08.060 --> 15:09.360]  Are you down? Are you okay, Andrew?
[15:09.480 --> 15:10.060]  I'm good. I'm good.
[15:10.520 --> 15:12.740]  Need to eat some food.
[15:14.000 --> 15:14.460]  There we go.
[15:14.920 --> 15:16.100]  Ammo pouches everywhere.
[15:16.340 --> 15:18.080]  Really? Where? On the ground.
[15:18.460 --> 15:19.280]  You said everywhere.
[15:20.120 --> 15:21.700]  Ammo box over here as well.
[15:22.120 --> 15:23.860]  God damn it, Nick. You scare me.
[15:25.800 --> 15:26.840]  I'm a scary bastard.
[15:28.300 --> 15:31.180]  So what are we doing here?
[15:31.360 --> 15:32.920]  So we gotta fight wave after wave
[15:32.920 --> 15:34.960]  and then a boss will show up and once we kill him
[15:34.960 --> 15:36.220]  he'll give us a key
[15:36.800 --> 15:39.240]  to open a loot lock.
[15:39.660 --> 15:40.340]  So if there's
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.660]  ammo pouches, just pick them up?
[15:42.660 --> 15:44.600]  Yeah. Just pick them up.
[15:45.200 --> 15:46.480]  As long as you need ammo.
[15:46.720 --> 15:48.120]  If you don't need ammo, don't pick them up.
[15:48.700 --> 15:51.180]  Explosive crate! Explosive crate skeleton
[15:51.180 --> 15:52.420]  coming in! Hi, Geoff.
[15:52.840 --> 15:53.200]  Shoot it.
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.000]  Me and Geoff are at the top. We're very tall.
[15:57.460 --> 15:58.300]  Yeah, I'm super tall.
[15:59.940 --> 16:00.860]  A lot of people are short.
[16:00.940 --> 16:01.480]  Not me and Geoff.
[16:02.240 --> 16:04.880]  They have blunderbusses! Holy hell!
[16:07.040 --> 16:07.980]  Avast, EC dogs!
[16:09.700 --> 16:10.460]  He shot me point-
[16:11.800 --> 16:12.820]  Who did that?
[16:13.040 --> 16:14.640]  Andrew! It wasn't me!
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.280]  Who shot that?
[16:17.060 --> 16:18.920]  Who did that? It wasn't me. I didn't shoot anything.
[16:19.180 --> 16:19.920]  Are you guys down?
[16:20.700 --> 16:21.080]  Yes.
[16:22.560 --> 16:24.160]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[16:25.240 --> 16:25.960]  We're fading!
[16:27.260 --> 16:28.780]  Right when I got to you!
[16:28.960 --> 16:29.380]  Come on!
[16:30.500 --> 16:32.680]  Are you up at the top? I'm at the top.
[16:32.740 --> 16:33.520]  Pick me up. Shit.
[16:33.900 --> 16:35.480]  I'm about halfway up.
[16:37.300 --> 16:37.540]  There you go.
[16:37.540 --> 16:39.840]  Otherwise I gotta go to the ferryman and wait for the slow door.
[16:40.540 --> 16:42.540]  Reviving, reviving, reviving, reviving.
[16:42.880 --> 16:44.020]  Halfway. Three quarters.
[16:44.100 --> 16:45.100]  All the way! You're back!
[16:45.200 --> 16:48.180]  Let me out! Let me out of here!
[16:48.840 --> 16:49.680]  I'm hungry.
[16:50.000 --> 16:50.980]  Give me some foods.
[16:51.900 --> 16:52.540]  You hungry, boy?
[16:53.480 --> 16:56.140]  I'll take all these coconuts.
[16:56.740 --> 16:58.060]  Are you Coco Coconut?
[16:59.200 --> 16:59.980]  That's my father.
[17:00.440 --> 17:02.080]  Are there more skeletons or what happened?
[17:02.840 --> 17:03.700]  We have to wait for another wave.
[17:04.520 --> 17:06.580]  How do I get enough money for a month?
[17:09.460 --> 17:10.080]  Where are they?
[17:10.740 --> 17:11.980]  Oh shit, they're down here, Nick.
[17:12.240 --> 17:13.380]  I want the mocha monkey.
[17:16.040 --> 17:17.480]  They're down here, Nick.
[17:18.020 --> 17:19.120]  I think they're all the way down here.
[17:19.580 --> 17:21.440]  Oh boy, they're like right on top of Nick.
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.680]  I got you, buddy. I got you.
[17:25.600 --> 17:26.440]  Ahoy, sea dogs.
[17:26.760 --> 17:27.480]  Why am I in the ocean?
[17:30.080 --> 17:31.720]  Why am I in the ocean?
[17:33.780 --> 17:35.060]  The problem is running backwards.
[17:35.720 --> 17:36.920]  Ah, you shouldn't do that.
[17:37.460 --> 17:38.200]  That'll do it.
[17:40.100 --> 17:40.960]  What's over here?
[17:42.340 --> 17:43.100]  Cannonball barrel.
[17:45.300 --> 17:46.840]  Hey, get away from me.
[17:47.400 --> 17:48.200]  Get out of here.
[17:50.240 --> 17:50.680]  Skeletons.
[17:51.120 --> 17:52.280]  Bad boys coming up at you.
[17:52.960 --> 17:54.580]  We just gotta keep running in circles until more guys come?
[17:54.660 --> 17:55.040]  Is that what's happening?
[17:57.580 --> 17:58.460]  Andrew doesn't know.
[17:59.340 --> 18:01.040]  There should be some around.
[18:01.680 --> 18:02.860]  Oh yeah, they're up here.
[18:03.740 --> 18:05.300]  As soon as all the ones
[18:05.300 --> 18:07.520]  of a current wave are dead, the next wave spawns.
[18:07.520 --> 18:07.720]  Okay.
[18:09.720 --> 18:10.520]  No respite.
[18:12.260 --> 18:12.860]  Is that it?
[18:13.640 --> 18:14.200]  Yeah, there we go.
[18:14.780 --> 18:15.620]  There they are.
[18:22.740 --> 18:25.200]  Watch out behind you. They're spawning behind you.
[18:25.400 --> 18:25.980]  They're spawning. Oh.
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.220]  Ow! Was that me?
[18:29.340 --> 18:29.780]  Who shot me?
[18:29.780 --> 18:32.060]  Oh no.
[18:32.960 --> 18:33.680]  Behind you.
[18:34.400 --> 18:36.280]  Thank you. Nice.
[18:36.900 --> 18:37.660]  I need food.
[18:38.700 --> 18:39.640]  Look for barrels.
[18:41.700 --> 18:42.240]  Ah, they're back.
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.100]  They're coming up out of the ground.
[18:44.900 --> 18:45.360]  Keymasters!
[18:46.860 --> 18:48.440]  I think they might catch you on fire
[18:48.440 --> 18:49.300]  if you hit them with a sword.
[18:50.340 --> 18:51.660]  Uh, no. Oh, Jesus.
[18:52.020 --> 18:52.640]  Oh my God.
[18:54.240 --> 18:55.320]  Not at all.
[18:55.540 --> 18:56.400]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[18:57.180 --> 18:58.780]  That is not a thing, but I like
[18:58.780 --> 19:00.660]  the idea. I get why you would think that.
[19:01.120 --> 19:02.780]  When I hit one earlier, I did catch fire
[19:02.780 --> 19:04.000]  and that must have been because of you.
[19:04.900 --> 19:06.540]  Yeah, that was, I threw a fire grenade.
[19:07.240 --> 19:08.360]  Okay, well that was you.
[19:08.680 --> 19:10.480]  Oh my God, Ashen Guardian's still chasing me.
[19:10.840 --> 19:13.100]  Get away from me. No, no! I missed my barrel.
[19:14.360 --> 19:14.500]  Uh oh.
[19:15.400 --> 19:15.940]  Uh oh.
[19:16.080 --> 19:18.620]  Uh oh. Get away!
[19:21.420 --> 19:21.960]  Hi, prick.
[19:22.420 --> 19:23.440]  Where is this guy? There he is.
[19:23.440 --> 19:24.920]  I'm still fucking him up.
[19:25.240 --> 19:26.980]  Yeah, I'm fighting the Ashen Keymaster.
[19:28.340 --> 19:30.080]  Me and Geoff against this Ashen Guardian.
[19:31.180 --> 19:32.520]  Okay, Keymaster is down.
[19:33.280 --> 19:33.720]  Bang!
[19:34.360 --> 19:35.420]  Shot him in the back. Did we drop a key?
[19:36.020 --> 19:38.080]  We sure did, but it's not the one to open the thing.
[19:38.520 --> 19:39.460]  A vanilla...
[19:39.940 --> 19:40.800]  Ooh, Gold Dutch.
[19:41.620 --> 19:43.840]  Take two. A villainous bounty skull.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.360]  Yeah, we got villainous bounty.
[19:46.260 --> 19:47.500]  We got a skull.
[19:48.120 --> 19:48.680]  The Duchess!
[19:50.080 --> 19:51.040]  Ahoy, the Duchess!
[19:51.040 --> 19:52.400]  Oh, the Duchess.
[19:53.200 --> 19:55.240]  Ow. Oh my God!
[19:55.480 --> 19:55.840]  I'm down.
[19:56.280 --> 19:58.180]  I'm down if you can get me up.
[19:58.400 --> 19:58.740]  I'm coming.
[20:00.600 --> 20:01.500]  I'm so far.
[20:06.250 --> 20:07.830]  Who are you going for?
[20:09.110 --> 20:10.010]  Looks like Geoff.
[20:10.470 --> 20:11.330]  You're not gonna make it.
[20:12.310 --> 20:12.990]  He's gone.
[20:14.910 --> 20:16.350]  Oh no, you're all gone. Ow, I'm shot.
[20:19.670 --> 20:20.710]  Hey, it's all of us.
[20:20.710 --> 20:23.390]  Welcome to the boat of death.
[20:24.550 --> 20:25.190]  Hello.
[20:25.730 --> 20:26.050]  Goodbye.
[20:27.250 --> 20:28.410]  Where'd you go?
[20:29.510 --> 20:30.570]  Boss lady.
[20:32.550 --> 20:33.730]  Ooh, milestone
[20:33.730 --> 20:34.550]  class three.
[20:35.090 --> 20:36.130]  Oh, she's chasing me.
[20:36.890 --> 20:38.230]  Duchess, no! Ow!
[20:38.650 --> 20:41.810]  Duchess, no. You said it like it was a small dog.
[20:42.210 --> 20:42.310]  Alright, here we go.
[20:42.310 --> 20:43.090]  We're back, boys.
[20:44.490 --> 20:46.970]  We're back, boys. Let's do it.
[20:48.190 --> 20:48.870]  Here?
[20:50.090 --> 20:51.150]  She's summoning
[20:51.150 --> 20:52.210]  skeletons.
[20:56.030 --> 20:56.710]  Ow!
[21:00.250 --> 21:01.350]  How you doing, Nick?
[21:01.810 --> 21:02.510]  Things are bad.
[21:02.650 --> 21:03.130]  Sounds good.
[21:05.170 --> 21:05.890]  Things are bad.
[21:07.270 --> 21:08.630]  Bad things.
[21:09.510 --> 21:11.250]  Hello. Put your blunderbuss down.
[21:11.490 --> 21:12.290]  Ooh, what are you?
[21:12.670 --> 21:14.730]  I got him.
[21:15.550 --> 21:17.430]  Ow! Are you digging something up?
[21:17.990 --> 21:19.850]  Yeah, the skeleton
[21:19.850 --> 21:21.730]  that you guys killed gave us a little diggable map
[21:21.730 --> 21:23.790]  for the island, so I'm digging up the treasure for that.
[21:23.890 --> 21:26.030]  And the key, we'll go into it.
[21:26.210 --> 21:27.090]  Got it. Okay, cool.
[21:27.650 --> 21:28.490]  I'm shooting the duchess.
[21:29.550 --> 21:30.730]  I'm stabbing the duchess.
[21:31.970 --> 21:33.170]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[21:33.430 --> 21:33.950]  I got your back.
[21:35.030 --> 21:37.030]  Murder, stab, kill.
[21:37.790 --> 21:37.910]  Ah!
[21:39.610 --> 21:41.350]  Move it to the dock and then
[21:41.350 --> 21:42.510]  feel free to go up and help her.
[21:42.510 --> 21:45.490]  Oh, are you alive still?
[21:46.210 --> 21:48.070]  Yes, very slowly dying.
[21:48.470 --> 21:49.110]  Don't die.
[21:50.030 --> 21:51.470]  Oh, yeah. Goodbye.
[21:52.670 --> 21:54.230]  She apparently is...
[21:54.230 --> 21:54.910]  Oh, goodness.
[21:55.690 --> 21:56.590]  Goodbye, friends.
[21:57.770 --> 22:00.090]  Oh, why didn't you say that you were down?
[22:02.790 --> 22:03.430]  I'm coming, Geoff.
[22:04.210 --> 22:04.690]  Yeah, fair play.
[22:06.590 --> 22:07.710]  You wouldn't have reached me anyway.
[22:08.310 --> 22:09.470]  I was down on the beach.
[22:11.050 --> 22:12.230]  She's gotta be pretty
[22:12.230 --> 22:14.270]  close to dead, though, at this point, I would think.
[22:14.270 --> 22:15.750]  I would think? Where is she?
[22:16.310 --> 22:17.070]  Ah, I found her!
[22:18.950 --> 22:19.710]  Get away, duchess!
[22:21.290 --> 22:21.970]  Duchess, no!
[22:23.410 --> 22:24.070]  Not the plants.
[22:26.230 --> 22:26.630]  Bang.
[22:27.410 --> 22:27.770]  Oh!
[22:28.850 --> 22:29.250]  Wow!
[22:30.230 --> 22:31.430]  Whoa, that was crazy.
[22:31.590 --> 22:34.610]  She does a ground pound and it's not good for you.
[22:34.990 --> 22:35.730]  No, it's a bad one.
[22:35.890 --> 22:37.130]  It's bad when she does a ground pound.
[22:37.710 --> 22:40.750]  Yeah, I'm alive. I just need to eat food and come back.
[22:41.390 --> 22:42.410]  I hear that.
[22:43.650 --> 22:44.910]  Where's she at?
[22:45.090 --> 22:45.710]  Where's she at?
[22:48.570 --> 22:49.050]  Duchess?
[22:49.310 --> 22:50.310]  She's over here, Andrew.
[22:50.710 --> 22:51.970]  I'm gonna go kill her.
[22:52.550 --> 22:54.430]  Hit the explosive button, you guys.
[22:55.350 --> 22:56.350]  Oh, that's a cannonball thing.
[22:56.510 --> 22:57.590]  Fuck, I'm out of ammo.
[22:59.270 --> 22:59.470]  Uh oh.
[23:00.350 --> 23:02.550]  I jumped at the right time.
[23:03.110 --> 23:03.390]  Oof.
[23:04.430 --> 23:05.410]  Hey, there's another boat coming.
[23:06.290 --> 23:07.070]  Is there?
[23:08.590 --> 23:09.930]  That's really not good.
[23:09.930 --> 23:10.870]  It's red.
[23:11.710 --> 23:13.310]  I don't know, are you gonna put a pin in the map?
[23:14.530 --> 23:15.830]  It's over here in the water.
[23:17.050 --> 23:18.110]  Please don't pound again.
[23:18.270 --> 23:19.230]  I'm going back to the boat for a minute.
[23:22.930 --> 23:24.270]  Coming up behind our boat.
[23:24.970 --> 23:25.650]  To the left of it.
[23:26.010 --> 23:27.630]  I assume that's very bad.
[23:28.630 --> 23:29.490]  Oh, yeah, that's bad.
[23:29.630 --> 23:31.310]  We gotta head back to the boat, get ready.
[23:31.650 --> 23:33.610]  Are we about to get in a boat fight?
[23:34.150 --> 23:34.310]  Yeah.
[23:36.470 --> 23:38.670]  Should I bring the ashen chest to the boat?
[23:38.670 --> 23:39.690]  Or leave it?
[23:40.470 --> 23:43.110]  We should try to get it with the...
[23:44.350 --> 23:44.670]  Harpoon?
[23:45.030 --> 23:45.550]  Yeah, if we can.
[23:45.950 --> 23:47.150]  It's gonna ram us!
[23:48.770 --> 23:49.670]  It rammed us!
[23:51.050 --> 23:51.910]  Right on them.
[23:53.290 --> 23:54.510]  I'm gonna board their boat and kill them.
[23:54.750 --> 23:55.650]  Yeah, you go ahead and do that.
[23:58.030 --> 23:59.670]  The duchess is on the dock waiting for us.
[23:59.770 --> 24:01.110]  She's like, I can't catch up with the boat.
[24:03.110 --> 24:04.150]  Can't catch up with the boat, fine.
[24:06.170 --> 24:07.270]  Gonna check below deck.
[24:07.270 --> 24:08.770]  They ran away. Yeah, why don't you do that?
[24:09.110 --> 24:10.490]  Andrew is on their boat.
[24:10.770 --> 24:12.170]  Yep, I'm gonna make sure it sinks.
[24:12.350 --> 24:12.750]  Yep.
[24:14.710 --> 24:18.010]  Oh, Andrew's on their boat and he is gonna blow this thing up.
[24:18.750 --> 24:21.310]  If anybody can help me in the basement, we have water.
[24:21.470 --> 24:22.450]  We are taking on water.
[24:22.450 --> 24:23.550]  Okay, what do you need?
[24:24.010 --> 24:25.250]  Can you scoop out the water?
[24:25.470 --> 24:26.270]  I'll patch holes.
[24:27.410 --> 24:29.510]  Alright, I'm on my way down.
[24:30.590 --> 24:30.870]  Thank you!
[24:31.310 --> 24:33.050]  Andrew, you're taking care of this.
[24:33.270 --> 24:33.370]  They're sunk.
[24:34.130 --> 24:34.790]  They're sunk?
[24:35.630 --> 24:37.170]  Do we need to worry about them coming back?
[24:38.430 --> 24:39.150]  Uh, potentially.
[24:40.750 --> 24:42.430]  That just sounds like a yes.
[24:43.850 --> 24:44.830]  Most likely, yeah.
[24:45.490 --> 24:46.130]  All the water's gone.
[24:46.390 --> 24:46.770]  You did it.
[24:47.550 --> 24:51.290]  We have to worry about them coming back and also knowing how to play the game better than us, potentially.
[24:51.650 --> 24:52.330]  Except for Andrew.
[24:52.950 --> 24:55.490]  Well, it doesn't seem like they did since Andrew sunk their ship.
[24:55.590 --> 24:56.370]  Well, Andrew's very good.
[24:57.390 --> 24:58.610]  You know what? Fair point.
[24:59.130 --> 25:00.110]  Let's load up the cannons.
[25:00.570 --> 25:02.230]  Oh yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
[25:02.390 --> 25:04.850]  I'm gonna shoot her with the cannon.
[25:05.430 --> 25:05.750]  Can you?
[25:06.370 --> 25:07.330]  Yeah, you can.
[25:07.490 --> 25:07.910]  Where is she?
[25:09.550 --> 25:11.150]  She was on the dock.
[25:12.810 --> 25:13.710]  I don't see her anymore.
[25:14.190 --> 25:15.250]  I don't see her anymore either.
[25:16.210 --> 25:17.410]  Are you all good on the boat front, Nick?
[25:18.310 --> 25:19.430]  Yep, we're all good.
[25:20.410 --> 25:23.270]  I'm loading all the cannons with cannonballs right now.
[25:23.370 --> 25:23.990]  I am as well.
[25:24.830 --> 25:25.430]  Just in case.
[25:25.830 --> 25:28.630]  I wonder if she respawned or despawned or something.
[25:28.630 --> 25:30.530]  It's been way too long.
[25:31.310 --> 25:32.210]  Does that happen?
[25:34.510 --> 25:35.070]  Sometimes.
[25:35.450 --> 25:36.390]  Not often, but it can.
[25:38.510 --> 25:39.450]  Where'd she go?
[25:40.190 --> 25:41.270]  Oh, she's right here.
[25:42.290 --> 25:42.990]  Touch ass!
[25:44.870 --> 25:47.050]  I saw you go flying, Geoff.
[25:47.150 --> 25:47.530]  Yeah.
[25:48.490 --> 25:49.850]  Is she up?
[25:50.010 --> 25:53.250]  Oh wow, Geoff got boned.
[25:54.250 --> 25:56.330]  I'll put some licks into her before I let her down.
[25:57.910 --> 25:58.590]  I'll hit her.
[25:58.910 --> 26:00.890]  She's gonna blow! She's gonna blow! Run!
[26:02.790 --> 26:03.830]  Oh, she didn't blow.
[26:07.510 --> 26:08.530]  Now she is.
[26:08.950 --> 26:09.750]  Oh, she's gone.
[26:13.890 --> 26:14.930]  My body!
[26:18.850 --> 26:19.630]  My legs!
[26:20.770 --> 26:21.310]  They're broken.
[26:23.190 --> 26:24.610]  Oh, she just went down?
[26:24.750 --> 26:26.590]  She's gonna teleport somewhere.
[26:26.590 --> 26:28.070]  Oh, is that what she does?
[26:28.450 --> 26:28.810]  Yeah.
[26:29.110 --> 26:29.470]  Okay.
[26:29.730 --> 26:30.030]  Out.
[26:30.330 --> 26:32.190]  There she is. She's in the... in the base.
[26:33.630 --> 26:34.370]  In the fort.
[26:35.430 --> 26:35.790]  Where?
[26:37.090 --> 26:37.950]  Oh, I see, I see.
[26:38.130 --> 26:38.550]  Bye, Andrew.
[26:41.370 --> 26:42.170]  Boy, I'm shooting her.
[26:42.970 --> 26:43.910]  Skeletons behind you, Geoff!
[26:44.130 --> 26:44.970]  Skeletons behind you, Geoff!
[26:44.970 --> 26:45.830]  Yeah, they have a ton of health.
[26:46.970 --> 26:47.330]  Ow!
[26:49.290 --> 26:50.430]  That should hurt her, guys.
[26:50.470 --> 26:50.970]  Okay, she's down.
[26:51.350 --> 26:51.710]  Yeah!
[26:52.850 --> 26:54.010]  Fuck you, Dutchess.
[26:54.030 --> 26:54.770]  Way to go, boys!
[26:55.210 --> 26:56.810]  I'm gonna check out for the other ship.
[26:57.690 --> 26:59.090]  Alright, you got the key?
[26:59.410 --> 27:00.930]  I'm grabbing gold pouches.
[27:01.190 --> 27:02.530]  Don't see anything.
[27:02.790 --> 27:04.590]  Nice, let's get all the pouches and stuff.
[27:04.730 --> 27:05.150]  Follow me.
[27:05.930 --> 27:07.870]  So we're going below, right here.
[27:08.370 --> 27:08.590]  Okay.
[27:10.850 --> 27:12.790]  And then, putting the key in.
[27:13.110 --> 27:13.530]  Hell yeah!
[27:16.690 --> 27:19.350]  Okay, let's quickly load up all the loot onto the dock.
[27:19.490 --> 27:20.190]  And then...
[27:21.470 --> 27:22.770]  Pick up treasure chest.
[27:22.770 --> 27:23.370]  You got it.
[27:25.450 --> 27:26.250]  Follow me!
[27:26.470 --> 27:26.930]  Oh my god.
[27:27.670 --> 27:29.310]  This is the best way to do it!
[27:29.470 --> 27:30.670]  Yeah, there's water.
[27:32.070 --> 27:32.470]  Crazy.
[27:33.030 --> 27:33.490]  You can swim.
[27:34.670 --> 27:37.530]  I didn't know it was there when I jumped, but I was hoping.
[27:41.730 --> 27:43.670]  That one boat gave us a scare, huh?
[27:44.610 --> 27:45.410]  Oh, terrifying.
[27:46.230 --> 27:48.450]  I think we gave them a bigger scare.
[27:48.930 --> 27:51.210]  I'm gonna go on the boat and start pulling these things up.
[27:51.750 --> 27:52.550]  Sounds good.
[27:54.170 --> 27:55.090]  Anything left, Andrew?
[27:55.450 --> 27:56.390]  Yeah, some chests.
[27:56.550 --> 27:57.750]  Lots of stuff.
[28:09.230 --> 28:10.330]  What am I...?
[28:10.330 --> 28:11.110]  Here, I'll move it for you.
[28:11.410 --> 28:12.310]  Thank you.
[28:19.920 --> 28:21.500]  The closer you put it to the front, the better.
[28:21.500 --> 28:22.300]  There you go, thank you.
[28:24.040 --> 28:24.800]  Thank you.
[28:25.360 --> 28:26.280]  Good work, boys.
[28:27.180 --> 28:29.420]  Probably be the last little bit, I think.
[28:30.400 --> 28:31.940]  Oh, we got four more things.
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.140]  Now, there's stuff
[28:33.140 --> 28:35.340]  over by where Andrew sunk
[28:35.340 --> 28:37.660]  their ship. Is that stuff to be concerned with?
[28:37.700 --> 28:38.700]  Like, we should go get it or no?
[28:39.360 --> 28:41.700]  It's probably, like, food barrels
[28:41.700 --> 28:42.860]  and cannibal crates.
[28:42.900 --> 28:45.660]  If it doesn't sparkle,
[28:45.920 --> 28:46.620]  you don't need it.
[28:46.820 --> 28:47.140]  Got it.
[28:49.340 --> 28:49.800]  Oh, wait.
[28:49.880 --> 28:51.100]  The zipline is faster, Geoff.
[28:51.580 --> 28:52.140]  Oh, okay.
[28:53.440 --> 28:54.740]  What am I missing? Here we go.
[28:56.900 --> 28:59.220]  I was about to move that
[28:59.220 --> 28:59.620]  for you there.
[29:00.860 --> 29:02.320]  Is this too much behind that?
[29:02.460 --> 29:03.680]  Yeah, it's behind the pole.
[29:04.440 --> 29:06.520]  There we go.
[29:08.260 --> 29:09.320]  Come on in, boys!
[29:09.320 --> 29:10.760]  I'm gonna hang on to that.
[29:13.720 --> 29:16.880]  He got ripped from the water.
[29:17.320 --> 29:19.220]  Why do we have this gunpowder barrel?
[29:20.460 --> 29:20.760]  Uh...
[29:20.760 --> 29:22.660]  Whose idea was that?
[29:22.820 --> 29:25.200]  I thought maybe it looked good. You guys don't like it?
[29:25.940 --> 29:27.280]  We're gonna dump that in the ocean.
[29:27.420 --> 29:28.040]  It's nice.
[29:29.120 --> 29:31.360]  If we were gonna be... If our goal was to
[29:31.360 --> 29:32.780]  board another ship...
[29:32.780 --> 29:33.660]  What happened?
[29:35.820 --> 29:37.680]  Did Geoff just drop it into the ocean?
[29:37.680 --> 29:38.600]  He did!
[29:38.880 --> 29:41.260]  If it touches our boat, it explodes.
[29:42.160 --> 29:42.920]  Next time.
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.480]  Hey, you guys should check to see if there's any water underneath the boat.
[29:45.980 --> 29:46.900]  There seems to be a lot.
[29:48.060 --> 29:48.900]  Thank you.
[29:49.140 --> 29:52.000]  There seems to be.
[29:52.140 --> 29:53.340]  Now, why is that?
[29:54.300 --> 29:55.040]  I don't know.
[29:56.100 --> 29:57.200]  Something weird happened.
[29:57.480 --> 29:59.320]  It's weird. I wet down the gunpowder
[29:59.320 --> 30:00.280]  so it wouldn't fire.
[30:01.300 --> 30:03.540]  I wet down the gunpowder.
[30:05.740 --> 30:07.560]  Always saying he's a gunpowder wetter.
[30:07.820 --> 30:10.500]  I mean, I just jumped off the boat with it into the ocean.
[30:10.600 --> 30:12.380]  I didn't actually touch the boat, I don't think.
[30:13.060 --> 30:14.420]  Well, it did somehow.
[30:16.820 --> 30:17.180]  Uh...
[30:17.180 --> 30:17.900]  We did it.
[30:18.240 --> 30:19.040]  We sure did.
[30:20.020 --> 30:21.400]  Let's go to the skull up ahead.
[30:21.960 --> 30:23.480]  Ooh, the red one. The orange one.
[30:23.560 --> 30:24.920]  Alright, I'm coming. I'm on my way back.
[30:25.500 --> 30:26.480]  Oh, good lord.
[30:26.660 --> 30:27.160]  That's pretty cool.
[30:29.600 --> 30:31.480]  I mean, you should wait for me, probably.
[30:31.480 --> 30:32.880]  Yeah, we don't have the sails down.
[30:32.940 --> 30:35.580]  So, it's just gonna allow us to move once we drop.
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.640]  Don't worry, guys. I'll be there.
[30:37.300 --> 30:38.920]  Also, there's a mask thing.
[30:39.920 --> 30:41.480]  I'm the communications director.
[30:44.220 --> 30:46.340]  Alright, I'm up. Let's go.
[30:47.740 --> 30:48.640]  Set sail for adventure.
[30:49.660 --> 30:50.900]  I'm still raised in anchor.
[30:51.280 --> 30:52.540]  That takes too long.
[30:52.600 --> 30:53.480]  I'm looking majestic.
[30:54.080 --> 30:56.400]  Someone wants to help on the anchor.
[30:56.940 --> 30:58.300]  I would, but I'm looking majestic.
[30:59.460 --> 31:00.320]  Alright, guys. I'm here.
[31:00.380 --> 31:01.660]  Let me lower the anchor.
[31:05.200 --> 31:06.740]  Alright, I'll pull down the sails.
[31:08.340 --> 31:10.420]  Okay, we might bump into some stuff on the way out.
[31:10.980 --> 31:11.560]  Don't do that.
[31:12.280 --> 31:13.120]  Is it explosive?
[31:13.580 --> 31:14.780]  Hopefully not.
[31:16.020 --> 31:17.460]  Anything good in that little
[31:18.940 --> 31:20.040]  turret thing in the water?
[31:23.600 --> 31:24.040]  Cannibals.
[31:24.520 --> 31:25.620]  That doesn't sound good.
[31:25.620 --> 31:27.060]  Do I need to check?
[31:27.520 --> 31:27.760]  I'm checking.
[31:27.960 --> 31:31.720]  I don't
[31:31.720 --> 31:33.040]  see any water coming in.
[31:33.620 --> 31:34.340]  We're fine.
[31:35.520 --> 31:36.360]  Something blew up!
[31:40.940 --> 31:41.740]  Where's the wood?
[31:41.880 --> 31:42.420]  Do I have wood?
[31:43.800 --> 31:44.720]  There's a wood barrel.
[31:45.480 --> 31:47.780]  I got the water out.
[31:48.320 --> 31:48.640]  Good job.
[31:49.660 --> 31:51.480]  Don't worry, guys. I'm still majestic
[31:51.480 --> 31:52.140]  up on the mast.
[31:52.140 --> 31:53.200]  Aw, good.
[31:54.440 --> 31:55.380]  You put sunscreen on?
[31:56.180 --> 31:57.400]  Fucking you know it, dude.
[31:57.660 --> 32:00.000]  Man, it must have been
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.680]  miserable back then on these boats.
[32:02.340 --> 32:04.000]  Hey, we might make it in like
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.880]  three months. I can imagine
[32:05.880 --> 32:07.720]  the first sunscreen crater,
[32:07.960 --> 32:09.140]  everyone thinking it's a fake.
[32:10.080 --> 32:11.880]  You hear that Bob's trying to sell some
[32:11.880 --> 32:13.780]  elixir that fights the sun?
[32:14.240 --> 32:16.400]  It's like he's rubbing some guy's cum all over his arms
[32:16.400 --> 32:17.580]  trying to get a sunburn.
[32:18.260 --> 32:19.860]  The vibes are in check.
[32:19.860 --> 32:20.640]  Good.
[32:22.920 --> 32:23.920]  Vibe Inspector
[32:23.920 --> 32:25.660]  has passed us.
[32:26.040 --> 32:27.200]  We got an A+.
[32:35.100 --> 32:35.780]  We got
[32:35.780 --> 32:37.080]  anything coming up ahead?
[32:39.100 --> 32:40.220]  Got some...
[32:40.220 --> 32:42.040]  Looks like...
[32:42.040 --> 32:43.600]  No, we're good. Some sort of a
[32:44.580 --> 32:45.880]  base on the
[32:45.880 --> 32:47.440]  immediate right, but I'm sure you're aware of that.
[32:50.100 --> 32:51.720]  A little island base.
[32:52.340 --> 32:52.780]  Boom.
[32:58.590 --> 32:59.470]  Incoming cannonballs.
[32:59.510 --> 33:00.310]  Uh-oh. We're getting attacked.
[33:00.450 --> 33:01.750]  Which side? Right side?
[33:02.250 --> 33:03.090]  On the right.
[33:04.190 --> 33:04.950]  It's on a ship.
[33:05.890 --> 33:07.810]  Oh, we're hit.
[33:09.270 --> 33:09.970]  Uh-oh.
[33:10.970 --> 33:11.470]  Is that underneath?
[33:13.050 --> 33:13.590]  I got my bucket.
[33:14.390 --> 33:14.970]  I'm a bucket man.
[33:16.450 --> 33:18.050]  We got water coming in.
[33:18.790 --> 33:19.730]  We got water coming out.
[33:22.230 --> 33:23.390]  Missed every shot I took.
[33:23.390 --> 33:24.030]  This is terrible.
[33:25.610 --> 33:26.790]  Just fucking bad.
[33:26.910 --> 33:29.670]  You may have missed every shot you took,
[33:29.750 --> 33:31.310]  but don't forget you also miss 100%
[33:31.310 --> 33:32.630]  of the shots you don't take.
[33:33.830 --> 33:34.970]  Now that's inspiration.
[33:35.430 --> 33:36.610]  Yeah, I'm real inspired.
[33:37.250 --> 33:38.730]  You may have missed, but you would have missed anyway.
[33:40.150 --> 33:40.950]  Where are we?
[33:41.250 --> 33:43.110]  We're gonna loop back around.
[33:45.130 --> 33:46.370]  Wow, it got dark fast.
[33:47.130 --> 33:49.390]  We want to go and fight these guys? Is that what's happening?
[33:49.590 --> 33:49.790]  Yep.
[33:51.290 --> 33:52.950]  Yeah, they said something about your mom.
[33:53.590 --> 33:53.910]  What?
[33:54.830 --> 33:55.150]  Yeah.
[33:56.370 --> 33:57.930]  Nobody wanted to tell you, but
[33:57.930 --> 33:59.870]  we just wanted to take care of it without you finding out,
[33:59.930 --> 34:01.290]  but it's better to be honest.
[34:02.050 --> 34:03.010]  Okay, we have a choice.
[34:04.050 --> 34:06.150]  Do we want to cash out what we have,
[34:07.070 --> 34:08.930]  or do we want to fight this boat
[34:09.630 --> 34:10.950]  that's coming towards us?
[34:11.130 --> 34:11.690]  I want to fight the boat.
[34:12.150 --> 34:13.150]  Don't you want to fight the boat?
[34:13.570 --> 34:15.070]  I'm good with fighting the boat, it's just
[34:15.070 --> 34:17.990]  do we want to try to cash out first so we don't lose everything
[34:17.990 --> 34:19.650]  before the boat kills us, but that's okay.
[34:20.010 --> 34:20.570]  Give a shit?
[34:21.570 --> 34:22.350]  Where's the boat?
[34:22.590 --> 34:26.050]  Until I can get a monkey, nothing matters.
[34:26.470 --> 34:27.070]  What do we got?
[34:27.350 --> 34:28.450]  See the boat coming up?
[34:28.790 --> 34:29.030]  No.
[34:29.210 --> 34:30.990]  No, where is it?
[34:32.350 --> 34:33.310]  It's uh...
[34:33.890 --> 34:35.390]  southwest of us.
[34:37.050 --> 34:38.270]  What a clock.
[34:38.610 --> 34:39.410]  I don't want to pull up a compass.
[34:41.050 --> 34:42.470]  It's directly in front of us.
[34:43.550 --> 34:44.910]  Do you see a boat?
[34:44.910 --> 34:46.350]  Directly in front.
[34:46.490 --> 34:47.350]  I'm looking.
[34:48.130 --> 34:49.350]  I don't see a boat.
[34:49.770 --> 34:51.470]  Let me get my looking glass.
[34:52.270 --> 34:53.330]  I feel nuts.
[34:53.770 --> 34:55.390]  I see a boat.
[34:55.690 --> 34:57.630]  It's way out there.
[34:58.010 --> 35:00.650]  Does it want to fight us?
[35:01.210 --> 35:01.550]  Yes.
[35:02.270 --> 35:05.190]  It has a combative flag on it.
[35:05.270 --> 35:05.590]  Oh, really?
[35:06.490 --> 35:07.690]  Combat flag.
[35:09.010 --> 35:10.010]  Oh, is it that thing?
[35:11.110 --> 35:12.490]  I didn't see it either.
[35:12.490 --> 35:14.090]  It's okay, Nick. I'm with you.
[35:15.370 --> 35:16.730]  You have a good eyesight, Andrew.
[35:16.870 --> 35:17.630]  Oh, we just unlocked a ship.
[35:17.650 --> 35:18.310]  It's on the map.
[35:19.890 --> 35:21.110]  How do you use the map?
[35:21.650 --> 35:22.730]  You go down to the map board.
[35:23.010 --> 35:24.150]  Oh, there's like a map room.
[35:24.330 --> 35:26.470]  I'm not going up down there.
[35:26.610 --> 35:30.030]  Let's just go on this island and see if he comes for us and then we go for him.
[35:30.090 --> 35:30.710]  What do you want to do?
[35:31.050 --> 35:33.730]  No, we gotta go for him if we're doing this.
[35:33.730 --> 35:34.830]  Yeah, that's not how it works.
[35:36.070 --> 35:36.950]  We have to strike first.
[35:38.810 --> 35:40.790]  A legendary servant, captained by Manny.
[35:41.930 --> 35:42.770]  Damn, Manny.
[35:44.110 --> 35:45.150]  Is it a four-player?
[35:47.190 --> 35:47.990]  Incoming cannon.
[35:49.990 --> 35:51.570]  Oh, it's going to drop right on us.
[35:51.930 --> 35:52.850]  Oh, wow!
[35:54.370 --> 35:55.830]  Oh, shit.
[35:57.130 --> 35:57.850]  Oh, we're hit.
[35:58.630 --> 35:59.090]  I'm going down.
[36:01.330 --> 36:03.010]  Do we just need to get out of here?
[36:03.890 --> 36:04.750]  Yeah, we could do that.
[36:04.930 --> 36:05.810]  Yeah, I think we should.
[36:06.690 --> 36:08.330]  Okay, let's southeast.
[36:09.010 --> 36:11.130]  Where's the skeleton we're supposed to be chasing?
[36:12.790 --> 36:14.310]  The giant skull in the sky?
[36:15.010 --> 36:16.250]  It's this island that we're at.
[36:16.330 --> 36:17.310]  That's why they're shooting us.
[36:18.690 --> 36:19.450]  Oh, boy!
[36:19.810 --> 36:20.610]  Alright, Nick, I'm coming.
[36:22.830 --> 36:24.310]  Getting the water out.
[36:24.890 --> 36:25.170]  Thank you.
[36:26.090 --> 36:27.550]  So, how do you deal with that?
[36:27.630 --> 36:32.550]  Do you just drop anchor far away and then take a boat in or something?
[36:32.930 --> 36:36.070]  You can typically sneak in and get close enough where they can't shoot you.
[36:36.070 --> 36:36.570]  Ah.
[36:38.330 --> 36:39.310]  I hear water.
[36:40.090 --> 36:41.270]  We're throwing water out.
[36:41.710 --> 36:43.150]  Okay, that's what that is.
[36:45.030 --> 36:46.310]  That sounded bad.
[36:47.190 --> 36:49.010]  That was a direct hit, but I don't see anything.
[36:50.070 --> 36:50.950]  Might be on the second deck.
[36:52.270 --> 36:53.590]  There's holes in the second deck?
[36:54.170 --> 36:57.270]  Yeah, you don't get as much water coming in, but it can get you.
[36:58.710 --> 37:00.410]  They're fully on our ass.
[37:00.570 --> 37:00.790]  Really?
[37:00.950 --> 37:02.990]  To the weapons!
[37:02.990 --> 37:03.150]  To the weapons!
[37:04.010 --> 37:05.510]  Make sure we're fully repaired.
[37:05.910 --> 37:06.350]  I'm repairing.
[37:07.130 --> 37:08.090]  I'm also repairing.
[37:10.730 --> 37:13.290]  Maybe I should... I don't have my sniper rifle, do I?
[37:13.510 --> 37:14.130]  I do.
[37:15.250 --> 37:16.130]  Go get... yeah.
[37:17.670 --> 37:18.650]  Alright, I'll get mine, too.
[37:20.670 --> 37:22.710]  The sniper rifle's a better idea than the cannon?
[37:23.730 --> 37:24.130]  No.
[37:24.370 --> 37:25.150]  No, not at all.
[37:25.730 --> 37:28.750]  But you can shoot them straight from the back with a sniper rifle.
[37:29.050 --> 37:30.910]  You can only hit them with a cannon if they're right up on you.
[37:32.310 --> 37:33.130]  Where are they, Andrew?
[37:33.630 --> 37:34.690]  They're right behind us.
[37:34.910 --> 37:38.090]  I think they're scared of us, if I'm being honest with you.
[37:38.110 --> 37:39.790]  Yeah, they're afraid of us, you can tell.
[37:41.230 --> 37:41.990]  They're looking...
[37:42.910 --> 37:43.290]  Wow.
[37:44.290 --> 37:46.530]  As we sail by, I'm going to sell something.
[37:46.890 --> 37:48.670]  Or at least...
[37:48.670 --> 37:49.330]  Get some gold.
[37:51.110 --> 37:51.730]  How are you going to do that?
[37:51.730 --> 37:52.570]  Are you just going to jump off?
[37:52.750 --> 37:53.670]  I'm just going to jump off.
[37:54.670 --> 37:55.990]  How do we get you back?
[37:56.850 --> 37:57.330]  I'll mermaid.
[37:57.330 --> 37:58.350]  Okay.
[38:00.350 --> 38:01.390]  They are...
[38:01.390 --> 38:02.650]  Coming right for us.
[38:03.090 --> 38:03.850]  Godspeed, Andrew.
[38:04.270 --> 38:08.370]  If we spin hard, can we line up and take a shot?
[38:08.550 --> 38:08.910]  Yeah, of course.
[38:10.070 --> 38:11.930]  Just hold off until I get back.
[38:12.190 --> 38:12.850]  They're turning.
[38:13.130 --> 38:15.150]  They're coming to our right side.
[38:15.290 --> 38:17.210]  Just remember...
[38:17.210 --> 38:19.610]  They probably are pretty good.
[38:20.050 --> 38:20.070]  No.
[38:20.430 --> 38:22.230]  I don't think so.
[38:22.570 --> 38:22.990]  We'll see.
[38:22.990 --> 38:24.990]  If they're messing with us, no way, baby.
[38:25.110 --> 38:27.050]  They have no idea who they're messing with.
[38:27.050 --> 38:29.030]  They're turning sideways so they can shoot us with cannons.
[38:29.610 --> 38:30.430]  Oh yeah, they sure are.
[38:31.490 --> 38:32.430]  Turn, turn, turn.
[38:32.710 --> 38:33.910]  I'm going to grab more wood.
[38:36.350 --> 38:37.370]  Hey, nice job, Andrew.
[38:37.830 --> 38:38.410]  Great job, Andrew.
[38:39.210 --> 38:40.210]  Oh, they're turning off.
[38:40.550 --> 38:42.310]  They are. They're gone.
[38:42.990 --> 38:43.690]  We did it!
[38:44.070 --> 38:47.350]  They probably realized who we were, who they were messing with.
[38:48.370 --> 38:50.470]  Now let's teach them a lesson and hunt them down.
[38:51.010 --> 38:51.750]  Sure, we can do that.
[38:51.750 --> 38:52.630]  Yeah!
[38:54.510 --> 38:54.910]  Nick liked.
[38:56.250 --> 38:56.930]  I do.
[38:58.110 --> 39:00.190]  I want them to learn a valuable lesson.
[39:00.190 --> 39:01.710]  That's awesome, so we're okay.
[39:02.090 --> 39:02.410]  Let's raise sails.
[39:04.110 --> 39:05.350]  Raise them.
[39:06.150 --> 39:06.510]  Raise.
[39:07.370 --> 39:08.290]  Raising sails.
[39:08.890 --> 39:09.890]  Raising sails.
[39:12.270 --> 39:13.750]  And sails are up.
[39:14.390 --> 39:15.110]  Alright, we're raised.
[39:15.110 --> 39:15.790]  Okay.
[39:18.690 --> 39:21.430]  I can't believe that guy left us alone.
[39:21.570 --> 39:22.050]  That's incredible.
[39:22.730 --> 39:24.690]  He didn't leave us alone, he chose to live.
[39:26.410 --> 39:27.830]  I'm sorry, that's what I meant.
[39:29.070 --> 39:30.410]  I was confused when I said that.
[39:31.430 --> 39:32.450]  Oh shit, there's...
[39:32.450 --> 39:35.170]  Hey, there's silver in the water here.
[39:35.310 --> 39:36.230]  There's sparkles in the water.
[39:36.670 --> 39:37.070]  Where?
[39:37.750 --> 39:38.390]  Right behind us.
[39:38.830 --> 39:41.810]  Oh, I do see it.
[39:41.810 --> 39:42.510]  Yeah, keep turning.
[39:43.090 --> 39:43.890]  I might be able to get it.
[39:44.670 --> 39:45.610]  I saw it sparkle.
[39:45.830 --> 39:54.930]  It will sink eventually, I think.
[39:57.050 --> 39:58.030]  How am I not hitting it?
[39:58.130 --> 39:58.610]  Come on.
[40:00.190 --> 40:01.310]  You gonna go straight for it, Nick?
[40:01.690 --> 40:02.450]  I'm gonna try to.
[40:04.550 --> 40:05.750]  Watch out for sharks.
[40:06.570 --> 40:06.750]  What?
[40:09.010 --> 40:10.170]  Dude, how am I missing?
[40:10.270 --> 40:11.030]  I'm going insane.
[40:12.450 --> 40:14.510]  What if this is just a lure to get us out of the ship?
[40:14.510 --> 40:15.350]  It could be.
[40:16.930 --> 40:18.650]  I hope I'm still heading for it.
[40:18.850 --> 40:20.970]  Dude, what am I missing here? I'm going crazy.
[40:21.270 --> 40:22.130]  I haven't hit anything.
[40:22.850 --> 40:23.690]  It might just be that far.
[40:24.770 --> 40:25.650]  Yeah, it might be out of range.
[40:26.570 --> 40:27.150]  Can you get closer?
[40:29.270 --> 40:30.850]  Oh, there's a treasure chest here.
[40:32.150 --> 40:32.670]  Got one.
[40:32.870 --> 40:33.710]  Are you at it, Nick?
[40:34.050 --> 40:36.590]  What is this? Trident of Dark Tides.
[40:36.630 --> 40:37.450]  Oh, you're gonna want that.
[40:37.990 --> 40:38.510]  That's a weapon.
[40:39.970 --> 40:41.110]  Bring me back, Eric.
[40:41.110 --> 40:41.630]  Got it.
[40:42.110 --> 40:43.230]  You missed me.
[40:43.750 --> 40:46.710]  Looks like there's nothing good here left.
[40:49.990 --> 40:51.370]  Nothing's sparkling below me.
[40:51.430 --> 40:52.030]  I'll just grab this.
[40:52.550 --> 40:53.650]  This is a weapon, huh?
[40:54.970 --> 40:57.150]  Can I pull the barrel off?
[40:57.390 --> 40:58.530]  And bring it into us?
[40:59.210 --> 41:02.070]  You can pull it in, and then you can just pull from it.
[41:02.550 --> 41:03.110]  While it's unplugged.
[41:03.830 --> 41:05.570]  So it's like, I got like mangoes and shit.
[41:06.410 --> 41:06.550]  Yeah.
[41:06.950 --> 41:07.350]  Just food.
[41:07.770 --> 41:09.910]  So, Andrew, is this like a one-time-use item?
[41:10.670 --> 41:12.290]  Uh, what is the item, sorry?
[41:12.410 --> 41:13.070]  The Trident.
[41:13.570 --> 41:15.250]  Oh, no, you can use it multiple times.
[41:16.330 --> 41:17.130]  Does anybody want a banana?
[41:17.430 --> 41:17.990]  I got a banana.
[41:19.070 --> 41:20.670]  We got a Megalodon, I think.
[41:22.090 --> 41:24.210]  Uh, I don't know how to handle that.
[41:24.970 --> 41:25.690]  A Megalodon!
[41:25.870 --> 41:27.650]  Yep, there it is to our right. Let's get it.
[41:28.630 --> 41:29.590]  What do we do? Kill it?
[41:29.610 --> 41:31.330]  Hop on cannons, fire at it.
[41:31.710 --> 41:32.830]  It's swimming towards us.
[41:34.750 --> 41:36.050]  What the hell is this thing?
[41:36.570 --> 41:37.590]  What's the Megalodon?
[41:38.150 --> 41:39.410]  Oh, no, there's stuff on the ship!
[41:39.550 --> 41:41.070]  Shit, it's spawning in, guys.
[41:41.410 --> 41:44.650]  Ah! Fight, fight, fight, fight!
[41:44.730 --> 41:45.150]  Ow!
[41:46.530 --> 41:47.670]  Shoot the Meg!
[41:49.150 --> 41:49.890]  One in.
[41:51.210 --> 41:52.010]  Come on, come on, come on.
[41:52.010 --> 41:52.890]  How many shots does it take?
[41:53.710 --> 41:54.590]  It's gonna take quite a few.
[41:55.070 --> 41:55.690]  Ah, shit.
[41:57.130 --> 41:57.590]  Unacceptable.
[41:58.990 --> 41:59.350]  Ow!
[42:03.050 --> 42:03.970]  That hurt.
[42:03.970 --> 42:05.210]  Yeah, it'll take a bite out of us.
[42:05.510 --> 42:06.590]  Where is it now?
[42:07.010 --> 42:08.450]  Okay, we got a bunch of holes in the bottom.
[42:09.110 --> 42:10.590]  Oh, shit, I'm going down!
[42:12.490 --> 42:13.110]  Alright, I'll stay up here.
[42:13.290 --> 42:14.410]  Oh, it's bad down there.
[42:14.690 --> 42:15.110]  I got water.
[42:18.930 --> 42:20.170]  Throw water on the shark.
[42:20.250 --> 42:20.970]  It'll confuse it.
[42:22.390 --> 42:23.450]  Okay, I'm gonna go seal up the holes.
[42:24.170 --> 42:24.350]  Alright.
[42:24.930 --> 42:25.630]  You guys bucket.
[42:27.310 --> 42:27.670]  Bucket.
[42:28.110 --> 42:29.510]  I might have a shot.
[42:30.330 --> 42:31.670]  Oh, no, guys.
[42:32.010 --> 42:34.150]  Andrew, you better put your...
[42:34.150 --> 42:35.130]  Bucket.
[42:36.430 --> 42:37.010]  Oh!
[42:38.290 --> 42:39.270]  Keep bucketing!
[42:41.150 --> 42:42.190]  Uh-oh, boys.
[42:42.730 --> 42:43.290]  Uh-oh, boys.
[42:44.110 --> 42:44.390]  We're okay.
[42:45.230 --> 42:47.950]  Make sure to throw the bucketed water out of the boat.
[42:48.570 --> 42:48.830]  Yes.
[42:51.090 --> 42:52.250]  The monsters are...
[42:52.250 --> 42:52.950]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:53.310 --> 42:54.090]  We got them.
[42:55.590 --> 42:57.470]  The monsters are...
[42:58.110 --> 42:58.470]  Huh?
[43:00.270 --> 43:00.630]  Nice.
[43:02.530 --> 43:04.410]  Well, I just wanted to teach that guy a lesson.
[43:04.530 --> 43:05.170]  And the Megalodon showed up.
[43:05.170 --> 43:07.230]  God, there's another bad guy up there. Come on.
[43:10.310 --> 43:11.430]  Ow, you absolute prick.
[43:11.430 --> 43:12.370]  Coming in for a bite.
[43:13.370 --> 43:15.330]  Oh, take a bite out of that, dickhead.
[43:15.430 --> 43:16.550]  Ow! I'm down.
[43:17.250 --> 43:18.610]  I gotta get picked up.
[43:19.110 --> 43:20.850]  Ah, shit. Fuck.
[43:21.570 --> 43:22.250]  I got you, Geoff.
[43:22.450 --> 43:24.390]  Thank you. I'll go straight to bucketing, I'm sure.
[43:24.890 --> 43:25.290]  Yep.
[43:25.830 --> 43:26.230]  Yep.
[43:28.490 --> 43:29.470]  Sorry, Eric. There's a lot.
[43:30.850 --> 43:31.710]  Eric, I got you.
[43:31.930 --> 43:32.850]  Okay, never mind. Sorry.
[43:33.830 --> 43:35.950]  The little fuckers are still attacking me, though.
[43:36.410 --> 43:37.670]  Yeah, I got him. I got this one.
[43:41.210 --> 43:41.610]  Alright.
[43:43.810 --> 43:46.510]  I'll start repairing once I get that thrown off the boat.
[43:48.010 --> 43:48.710]  Alright, I'm going down.
[43:50.350 --> 43:51.550]  Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[43:53.410 --> 43:54.230]  Oh, yeah, they are.
[43:54.290 --> 43:55.270]  Alright, I'll fight them for a minute.
[43:56.610 --> 43:57.510]  I'm at the holes.
[43:58.790 --> 44:00.170]  Well, the monsters are everywhere upstairs,
[44:00.310 --> 44:00.650]  so I'm gonna fight them.
[44:00.650 --> 44:03.010]  Who's neatgorilla2440?
[44:03.230 --> 44:03.750]  Oh, that's me.
[44:03.990 --> 44:06.790]  That's probably somebody from that other boat that fled.
[44:07.490 --> 44:07.730]  Oh.
[44:07.990 --> 44:08.010]  Fled.
[44:10.910 --> 44:12.290]  Please, we're drowning. Fled.
[44:12.910 --> 44:13.810]  Oh, I'm dead on the top.
[44:14.130 --> 44:14.590]  Yeah, I see you.
[44:15.010 --> 44:16.890]  Pick me up, macaw.
[44:16.890 --> 44:17.670]  Ow!
[44:18.510 --> 44:21.090]  Okay, we need everybody on buckets.
[44:24.450 --> 44:26.830]  Okay, I think I've patched some holes.
[44:26.990 --> 44:27.990]  I need more stuff.
[44:28.590 --> 44:29.730]  Keep going. Good job, Nick.
[44:30.210 --> 44:31.190]  Uh, ferryman for me.
[44:33.150 --> 44:34.510]  The ferryman for me.
[44:35.130 --> 44:36.330]  The ferryman can.
[44:37.430 --> 44:38.670]  The ferryman can.
[44:38.690 --> 44:39.910]  He'll take you from this world.
[44:40.310 --> 44:42.310]  Well, we got away from the one guy. That was good.
[44:42.650 --> 44:44.110]  Megalodon came. That's bad.
[44:44.110 --> 44:46.450]  Dude, I've never fucked with a megalodon before.
[44:46.650 --> 44:48.630]  Maybe that's why they left. Do you think that's why they left?
[44:48.830 --> 44:48.930]  Yeah.
[44:50.310 --> 44:52.350]  They saw it and they're like, bail out.
[44:53.650 --> 44:54.710]  Let me out.
[44:57.350 --> 44:58.370]  Nick, if you want to start
[44:58.370 --> 44:58.910]  patching.
[45:00.410 --> 45:01.090]  Uh, okay.
[45:02.530 --> 45:03.050]  Uh-oh!
[45:04.790 --> 45:06.090]  Oh, these are not loaded.
[45:06.330 --> 45:06.610]  Ah!
[45:07.390 --> 45:09.930]  We need everybody on patching for a minute.
[45:09.930 --> 45:10.730]  I'm down. I'm down.
[45:10.730 --> 45:11.510]  Patching.
[45:13.050 --> 45:14.830]  I'm on the top deck.
[45:15.070 --> 45:15.330]  Yep.
[45:15.450 --> 45:15.970]  Patching.
[45:19.010 --> 45:19.630]  Patching.
[45:22.450 --> 45:24.550]  I got it. I'm bucketing.
[45:25.190 --> 45:26.370]  Alright, I'm a bucket.
[45:27.490 --> 45:28.390]  I'm a bucket.
[45:29.010 --> 45:30.170]  What are you?
[45:30.690 --> 45:32.610]  I'm a bucket. How about you?
[45:33.130 --> 45:33.970]  I'm a bucket.
[45:34.790 --> 45:35.590]  Please don't die.
[45:35.950 --> 45:37.610]  Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[45:38.550 --> 45:40.010]  These fucking guys.
[45:40.210 --> 45:41.630]  These fucking guys.
[45:43.190 --> 45:44.350]  I just don't know how to kill them.
[45:44.590 --> 45:44.630]  Okay.
[45:45.350 --> 45:46.470]  Oh, shit!
[45:51.240 --> 45:51.940]  Die, prick!
[45:52.040 --> 45:52.340]  Nice.
[45:53.240 --> 45:54.280]  Alright, he's dead.
[45:54.440 --> 45:58.000]  Gotta eat. Hang on.
[45:58.140 --> 45:59.500]  Okay, another bite coming in.
[46:00.400 --> 46:00.640]  Ah!
[46:01.560 --> 46:03.120]  I'm going on the patching immediately.
[46:03.440 --> 46:04.400]  I'm getting the water out.
[46:08.470 --> 46:08.950]  Okay.
[46:08.950 --> 46:10.390]  Now we can hop on cannons.
[46:10.610 --> 46:12.570]  Yeah, we need to refill.
[46:12.990 --> 46:14.950]  I'm loading cannonballs.
[46:15.930 --> 46:16.590]  I'm loading cannonballs.
[46:16.590 --> 46:18.190]  I'm going to patch the second deck while we have a minute.
[46:19.410 --> 46:19.850]  Patching.
[46:20.170 --> 46:21.230]  Here he comes.
[46:23.170 --> 46:23.610]  No!
[46:24.270 --> 46:25.210]  What the fuck?
[46:30.430 --> 46:32.070]  We'll just keep leapfrogging each other here, Andrew.
[46:33.110 --> 46:33.790]  Great job, Nick.
[46:34.730 --> 46:35.210]  You too, Andrew.
[46:36.250 --> 46:37.910]  Get off my nuts.
[46:40.190 --> 46:40.610]  Alright.
[46:40.830 --> 46:41.870]  Uh, where's this motherfucker?
[46:42.850 --> 46:43.890]  Don't do it. Don't die.
[46:43.970 --> 46:44.430]  Ah, there's more.
[46:45.330 --> 46:47.710]  It's not fair that the Megalodon has minions.
[46:48.090 --> 46:48.690]  Yeah, I agree.
[46:49.310 --> 46:50.950]  It's like you're already the biggest shark ever.
[46:51.190 --> 46:52.590]  Do you need followers?
[46:56.110 --> 46:56.950]  Loading cannonballs.
[46:57.550 --> 46:59.070]  Loading cannonballs on the other side.
[47:03.140 --> 47:03.800]  Oh, no.
[47:04.080 --> 47:04.840]  Oh, that hurt.
[47:05.160 --> 47:05.840]  Alright, another bite.
[47:05.840 --> 47:06.440]  Yep.
[47:06.820 --> 47:07.860]  Let's get down and get water.
[47:09.400 --> 47:11.500]  We are down to very few planks.
[47:11.780 --> 47:14.020]  There's a crate of planks right below it.
[47:14.520 --> 47:14.900]  Okay.
[47:16.480 --> 47:18.360]  There's also a cannonball crate
[47:18.360 --> 47:19.580]  in the middle of the boat
[47:19.580 --> 47:21.520]  on the top floor for easy pull.
[47:23.060 --> 47:23.840]  There's also a...
[47:26.380 --> 47:27.880]  Did we run into a rock?
[47:28.620 --> 47:28.860]  Yeah.
[47:29.720 --> 47:30.900]  Or it looks like we did.
[47:33.060 --> 47:34.460]  Every time he bites us,
[47:34.460 --> 47:35.580]  he launches us.
[47:36.420 --> 47:38.520]  Alright, I killed that bitch.
[47:41.440 --> 47:42.540]  Food barrel empty.
[47:43.000 --> 47:43.240]  Fucker.
[47:44.260 --> 47:45.220]  It's not loaded.
[47:48.920 --> 47:50.060]  Suck shit, asshole.
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.280]  Do I have different cannonballs
[47:53.280 --> 47:54.480]  or is it just these cannonballs?
[47:55.720 --> 47:56.680]  You might have different ones.
[47:56.680 --> 47:58.160]  There are different cannonballs down there.
[48:02.160 --> 48:03.180]  Come right for us!
[48:03.180 --> 48:05.260]  I hit him head on.
[48:05.740 --> 48:06.680]  We're gonna get bit.
[48:07.740 --> 48:09.100]  I think he's stuck.
[48:09.260 --> 48:09.980]  I shot him.
[48:10.320 --> 48:11.660]  He's stuck.
[48:13.880 --> 48:14.400]  Dumbass.
[48:14.680 --> 48:16.000]  Oh, he's dead. We got him.
[48:16.080 --> 48:17.200]  We got him.
[48:17.220 --> 48:19.720]  Yeah, and then we got got.
[48:20.040 --> 48:21.420]  Now what?
[48:22.000 --> 48:22.720]  Checking the water.
[48:23.060 --> 48:23.600]  Got water.
[48:24.140 --> 48:27.080]  Got the water.
[48:28.420 --> 48:29.000]  Water out.
[48:29.000 --> 48:29.580]  We're repairing one.
[48:30.100 --> 48:32.180]  Fuck, these guys are still here? Are you kidding me?
[48:32.260 --> 48:33.080]  We're repairing two.
[48:34.480 --> 48:36.600]  Yeah, it's not like a vampire situation.
[48:36.720 --> 48:38.480]  When you kill the master, they still live, apparently.
[48:38.920 --> 48:40.660]  I'm down. Somebody pick me up.
[48:43.340 --> 48:44.880]  Maybe he's not dead.
[48:46.000 --> 48:46.100]  Four.
[48:47.420 --> 48:48.280]  What's going on?
[48:48.600 --> 48:49.800]  Did I get everything?
[48:50.920 --> 48:51.960]  Not dead!
[48:53.020 --> 48:53.660]  I'm down.
[48:54.140 --> 48:55.180]  He's not dead?
[48:55.180 --> 48:56.120]  He's coming for a bite.
[48:56.380 --> 48:57.680]  I'm down on the second floor.
[48:59.740 --> 49:00.640]  I'm getting you, Geoff.
[49:01.920 --> 49:03.300]  I'm emptying water still.
[49:03.440 --> 49:03.720]  There you go.
[49:04.080 --> 49:05.420]  Good job.
[49:05.740 --> 49:08.180]  I'm going to empty water.
[49:08.600 --> 49:09.420]  I'm just emptying water.
[49:10.180 --> 49:10.660]  I hit him.
[49:14.310 --> 49:15.330]  Where is he?
[49:18.140 --> 49:19.820]  He looks damn...
[49:20.520 --> 49:21.480]  He looks alive.
[49:22.760 --> 49:23.740]  Sure is alive.
[49:23.840 --> 49:25.960]  It was weird. It gave me the kill reticle on it.
[49:25.960 --> 49:27.260]  I've never fought one of these.
[49:27.740 --> 49:29.980]  Oh, these little bastards.
[49:29.980 --> 49:31.620]  We're taking out a lot of water.
[49:32.520 --> 49:34.480]  There's so much water.
[49:34.980 --> 49:36.140]  Oh, bucket.
[49:37.200 --> 49:38.900]  There's so much water.
[49:39.300 --> 49:39.900]  Fuck, I'm stuck.
[49:40.780 --> 49:44.920]  I'm going to go low and patch us up.
[49:47.360 --> 49:48.000]  Okay.
[49:48.380 --> 49:48.720]  Down I go.
[49:54.340 --> 49:54.940]  I'm dead.
[49:55.400 --> 49:56.280]  Bucket, bucket, bucket.
[49:57.440 --> 49:58.460]  Okay, got one.
[49:59.060 --> 49:59.920]  Got another one.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.120]  I'm just going to go assist the ferryman.
[50:01.420 --> 50:01.680]  Yep.
[50:03.560 --> 50:04.120]  Godspeed.
[50:04.640 --> 50:06.760]  I'll be back as soon as I fucking can.
[50:08.640 --> 50:09.200]  Three.
[50:12.020 --> 50:12.740]  Getting water.
[50:14.680 --> 50:15.380]  Nick's down.
[50:15.740 --> 50:16.400]  I'm down.
[50:16.840 --> 50:18.120]  I'm coming to you.
[50:19.220 --> 50:21.300]  I'm coming out with bucket in hand.
[50:22.560 --> 50:23.920]  Okay, hurry on the buckets.
[50:23.920 --> 50:25.220]  Waiting for the door.
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.440]  Alright.
[50:27.920 --> 50:29.380]  Reviving, reviving, reviving.
[50:29.960 --> 50:30.180]  Oh god.
[50:31.880 --> 50:32.280]  Gotcha.
[50:32.640 --> 50:33.520]  Nice work.
[50:34.840 --> 50:35.860]  Okay, we need a lot of buckets.
[50:37.300 --> 50:38.220]  I'm patching.
[50:38.600 --> 50:39.080]  Bucket.
[50:44.000 --> 50:44.940]  I'm patching.
[50:45.520 --> 50:46.080]  A bucket.
[50:46.680 --> 50:47.060]  Nice job.
[50:48.260 --> 50:49.240]  We got one over here by me.
[50:49.240 --> 50:49.400]  Coming here.
[50:51.460 --> 50:53.500]  We are dangerously low on wood.
[50:53.700 --> 50:54.200]  Yeah, I got it.
[50:54.260 --> 50:55.500]  I have like four planks.
[50:57.060 --> 50:58.080]  Andrew was saying there's more.
[51:00.660 --> 51:01.320]  While I'm up here,
[51:01.340 --> 51:02.120]  I'm going to shoot the thing.
[51:03.240 --> 51:03.700]  Got him.
[51:04.420 --> 51:05.860]  Alright, I'm going to fight the little dickhead.
[51:07.840 --> 51:09.100]  I'm going to get the stuff
[51:09.100 --> 51:10.220]  on the second deck.
[51:11.200 --> 51:11.900]  He's dead.
[51:15.040 --> 51:16.660]  Okay, going in for a bite. Get ready.
[51:16.660 --> 51:18.220]  I hear something
[51:19.020 --> 51:20.460]  on the second deck.
[51:21.440 --> 51:22.320]  Ah, prick.
[51:22.540 --> 51:23.400]  Okay, patch in the bottom.
[51:24.180 --> 51:27.600]  I'll help you.
[51:28.340 --> 51:29.180]  He's dead.
[51:29.720 --> 51:30.720]  What was that?
[51:31.240 --> 51:32.780]  Bucket, bucket, bucket.
[51:34.000 --> 51:34.540]  Bucket.
[51:41.960 --> 51:42.640]  Alright.
[51:44.820 --> 51:46.300]  I'm loading cannons.
[51:47.640 --> 51:47.980]  I'm just...
[51:47.980 --> 51:48.660]  Alright, I got the water out.
[51:53.600 --> 51:54.440]  Oh, boy.
[52:00.400 --> 52:01.580]  Okay, he's dead.
[52:02.220 --> 52:02.780]  Who's dead?
[52:03.340 --> 52:05.140]  He's coming around the front to the right side.
[52:05.780 --> 52:06.000]  Okay.
[52:10.660 --> 52:11.900]  Alright, I loaded that cannon.
[52:12.980 --> 52:14.100]  Here he comes on the right.
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.540]  Loaded that cannon.
[52:16.240 --> 52:16.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:19.360 --> 52:20.320]  Nice shot.
[52:21.620 --> 52:22.340]  He's coming.
[52:22.740 --> 52:23.640]  Fire, fire, fire, fire.
[52:27.220 --> 52:27.940]  Oh, nice.
[52:28.860 --> 52:29.220]  Way to go.
[52:29.240 --> 52:30.440]  Load him up again, load him up again.
[52:30.580 --> 52:32.400]  Oh, he didn't hit, he didn't bite. Nice.
[52:32.800 --> 52:34.480]  I think you can stop him from biting if you hit him enough.
[52:34.940 --> 52:36.400]  Yeah, he's coming up on the...
[52:36.400 --> 52:37.100]  He's swimming right.
[52:39.400 --> 52:39.740]  Yeah.
[52:40.960 --> 52:42.200]  Knocked some of that armor off, huh?
[52:44.220 --> 52:44.880]  There we go.
[52:45.040 --> 52:45.280]  Get the fuck out of here.
[52:47.020 --> 52:48.080]  Keep swimming, dickhead.
[52:52.490 --> 52:53.490]  Oof, who got me?
[52:54.150 --> 52:54.870]  Nice shot.
[52:54.870 --> 52:56.790]  I need food, bad.
[52:57.510 --> 52:58.450]  Yeah, I do too.
[53:00.270 --> 53:01.390]  What are we doing down here?
[53:01.590 --> 53:03.390]  We're hitting him hard. He's coming around the other side.
[53:03.450 --> 53:04.390]  He's coming around the other side.
[53:07.970 --> 53:08.990]  I'm out of ammo.
[53:09.230 --> 53:09.390]  Empty.
[53:11.170 --> 53:12.470]  Well, we're just going to live without it.
[53:12.490 --> 53:13.030]  God help us.
[53:13.530 --> 53:15.390]  Okay, here he comes. Comes to the other side.
[53:17.910 --> 53:18.850]  Alright, here we go.
[53:20.610 --> 53:21.410]  Get on cannons.
[53:24.630 --> 53:25.310]  Nice shots.
[53:30.200 --> 53:31.240]  Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[53:31.460 --> 53:32.440]  See if he comes back around.
[53:32.840 --> 53:34.280]  Because we got to hit him hard if he comes in.
[53:37.160 --> 53:38.140]  Here he comes, here he comes.
[53:38.520 --> 53:39.760]  His little dickhead friends are around.
[53:39.760 --> 53:40.760]  Give him everything, give him everything.
[53:41.660 --> 53:43.240]  I'll try to keep the monsters off of you guys.
[53:44.320 --> 53:44.900]  I'm down.
[53:45.480 --> 53:46.460]  Fuck, okay, I'm getting neck.
[53:48.260 --> 53:49.500]  I'm super low health.
[53:50.040 --> 53:50.620]  I got nothing.
[53:51.100 --> 53:51.600]  Yeah, same.
[53:51.600 --> 53:53.180]  Oh, thank you, you got me back.
[53:54.120 --> 53:54.620]  Ah, damn.
[53:55.400 --> 53:56.520]  Nick, do you want to start repairing?
[53:57.160 --> 53:58.240]  Yeah, reviving you, Geoff.
[53:58.600 --> 53:59.740]  No, you're not.
[54:01.160 --> 54:01.380]  Fuck!
[54:03.320 --> 54:03.600]  I'm down.
[54:05.100 --> 54:06.660]  I'm just going to go ferryman.
[54:07.340 --> 54:08.100]  Oh, God.
[54:08.540 --> 54:09.800]  Alright, just keep it all together, Nick.
[54:10.440 --> 54:11.500]  By yourself, you got this.
[54:11.540 --> 54:14.080]  Just do all the work.
[54:15.920 --> 54:16.340]  Oh, God.
[54:16.820 --> 54:17.380]  Just bucket.
[54:17.380 --> 54:18.600]  Just bucket.
[54:19.260 --> 54:20.440]  Get on those buckets.
[54:23.620 --> 54:24.980]  Let me out.
[54:25.480 --> 54:30.560]  Oh, God.
[54:33.500 --> 54:34.040]  Okay.
[54:34.960 --> 54:36.820]  Alright, door open. Here we go.
[54:37.380 --> 54:37.660]  Oh, God.
[54:38.980 --> 54:40.740]  Bucket, bucket, bucket.
[54:41.360 --> 54:43.120]  Let me go, I'll just go to the ferryman.
[54:44.540 --> 54:46.000]  I'm not in the boat.
[54:48.040 --> 54:49.520]  It's sunk, it's sunk, we sunk.
[54:49.880 --> 54:50.360]  Oh, really?
[54:54.340 --> 54:55.640]  How do I find a mermaid?
[54:57.280 --> 54:58.760]  Uh, it'll spawn in a minute.
[55:00.680 --> 55:01.620]  So we sunk, huh?
[55:02.180 --> 55:03.660]  Yeah, that was a tough fight.
[55:04.800 --> 55:06.120]  I wonder how close we were to beating it.
[55:07.380 --> 55:08.380]  We got his armor off.
[55:08.520 --> 55:12.200]  We could head back here and try to get him again.
[55:12.540 --> 55:12.720]  Yeah.
[55:12.720 --> 55:13.580]  I'm just gonna hang out.
[55:14.180 --> 55:15.100]  Hey, look, it's a mermaid.
[55:18.440 --> 55:20.400]  Oh, I don't wanna fight that guy again.
[55:21.240 --> 55:22.060]  Do we wanna...
[55:22.060 --> 55:23.240]  We almost killed it, I assume.
[55:24.580 --> 55:27.420]  Like, it doesn't regain health, is what I'm saying.
[55:28.800 --> 55:29.040]  Oh.
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.380]  So if we fought it again, it would be low health like that?
[55:33.860 --> 55:36.300]  Yeah, if we come back, it'll remain...
[55:36.300 --> 55:37.080]  The progress remains.
[55:37.320 --> 55:38.500]  Oh, then we should go do that, yeah.
[55:38.840 --> 55:40.700]  And we can recoup all the stuff that we just lost.
[55:40.700 --> 55:41.920]  Nick is killing pigs.
[55:42.240 --> 55:44.640]  Yeah, let's just quickly...
[55:45.080 --> 55:45.980]  I'm in the ferryman.
[55:49.580 --> 55:51.080]  We lost all that shit though, yeah?
[55:51.280 --> 55:52.520]  Yeah, but we can retrieve it.
[55:52.580 --> 55:54.020]  It'll be in the ocean for a little bit.
[55:54.720 --> 55:57.820]  It will sink. And you can go down and get it too, if it sinks.
[55:58.140 --> 55:59.980]  Yeah, let's just quickly try to get back there.
[56:00.080 --> 56:01.940]  So let's raise anchor as soon as you get on the boat.
[56:03.960 --> 56:04.520]  I'm with ya.
[56:05.380 --> 56:06.600]  I'm coming back from the ferryman.
[56:08.020 --> 56:08.700]  I'm on the boat.
[56:09.400 --> 56:10.260]  Coming to the boat.
[56:10.380 --> 56:11.700]  You can hop on anchor please.
[56:14.660 --> 56:15.460]  Thank you.
[56:17.820 --> 56:18.880]  I'm behind you.
[56:24.380 --> 56:26.700]  Will we have a bunch of fresh supplies now?
[56:27.280 --> 56:27.540]  Yep.
[56:28.940 --> 56:31.180]  That'll be helpful, we should load the cannons in a second.
[56:31.380 --> 56:32.560]  I'll load them.
[56:33.660 --> 56:33.900]  Okay.
[56:35.040 --> 56:36.700]  Should I lower the sails?
[56:36.700 --> 56:37.100]  Yes.
[56:38.260 --> 56:39.140]  One sec.
[56:39.920 --> 56:40.840]  You gotta go northeast.
[56:41.740 --> 56:43.660]  And then drop sails.
[56:44.940 --> 56:46.140]  So raise them now?
[56:46.460 --> 56:47.100]  Or lower them now?
[56:48.020 --> 56:48.540]  Yeah, go ahead.
[56:50.140 --> 56:53.600]  Okay, let's drop sails and try to catch wind so we go faster if we can.
[56:55.240 --> 56:57.120]  Is it the opposite way we're looking right now?
[56:58.360 --> 57:01.080]  You want the wind to blow into the sail.
[57:01.520 --> 57:01.760]  Yeah.
[57:02.640 --> 57:04.720]  So if you look at the wind in the sky...
[57:04.720 --> 57:05.900]  Yeah, I'm looking at it.
[57:06.120 --> 57:06.840]  There it goes.
[57:07.600 --> 57:10.280]  Let's get the boat equipped with cannons and all that.
[57:11.380 --> 57:13.540]  I'm loading cannonballs right now.
[57:13.660 --> 57:14.080]  Sweet.
[57:14.500 --> 57:16.480]  Alright, sails are up.
[57:17.380 --> 57:18.240]  I'll load it up.
[57:22.460 --> 57:24.700]  Don't forget we do more damage with the different kinds of cannon.
[57:24.840 --> 57:27.080]  Like the double shots and the incendiary shots.
[57:28.300 --> 57:30.740]  Alright, I'm loaded up with wood and food.
[57:30.820 --> 57:33.120]  I have wood, I should grab some food.
[57:33.860 --> 57:34.880]  Where's the food?
[57:35.960 --> 57:39.700]  Be on the lookout once we start getting closer to the area.
[57:39.800 --> 57:40.660]  If you recognize it.
[57:40.860 --> 57:42.240]  To see your stuff floating in the water.
[57:42.540 --> 57:43.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[57:43.240 --> 57:44.520]  Start harpooning before it disappears.
[57:44.640 --> 57:45.880]  I don't recognize anything.
[57:46.100 --> 57:48.060]  Everything was dark and there was a big ass shark.
[57:48.280 --> 57:49.040]  I don't recognize anything.
[57:49.640 --> 57:51.880]  This definitely looks like the same water.
[57:53.200 --> 57:55.260]  Yeah, I've seen this water before.
[57:55.540 --> 57:57.620]  Yeah, with the white caps and all the waves.
[57:57.760 --> 57:59.040]  I've definitely seen waves.
[58:00.500 --> 58:00.880]  Cool.
[58:01.480 --> 58:04.500]  Looks like we're going straight at this rock.
[58:05.320 --> 58:05.720]  Cropping.
[58:06.920 --> 58:09.080]  Okay, we can adjust the sails.
[58:09.800 --> 58:10.220]  Catch them.
[58:13.410 --> 58:13.950]  And then...
[58:13.950 --> 58:16.070]  I think you gotta make a turn.
[58:17.530 --> 58:18.630]  Okay, turning in a sec.
[58:20.670 --> 58:21.250]  I'm turning.
[58:21.850 --> 58:24.090]  I can't see where I'm going because the sail's in the way.
[58:24.190 --> 58:25.590]  But I'm just turning hard right.
[58:25.930 --> 58:26.870]  Let me know when to turn back.
[58:27.490 --> 58:28.150]  Keep going hard right.
[58:28.590 --> 58:29.230]  There you go.
[58:29.450 --> 58:31.490]  You got it. You can even out.
[58:32.530 --> 58:33.830]  You can go a little left.
[58:35.130 --> 58:35.990]  Yeah, definitely left.
[58:37.250 --> 58:38.430]  That might be good.
[58:40.510 --> 58:43.250]  There is an outcrop of islands.
[58:43.250 --> 58:44.370]  Yeah, there's a little island here.
[58:44.610 --> 58:47.030]  Over to our front left.
[58:47.690 --> 58:48.570]  Is that a ship over there?
[58:48.630 --> 58:49.030]  What is that?
[58:49.930 --> 58:50.570]  Should I avoid it?
[58:51.630 --> 58:52.870]  There's a ship.
[58:53.110 --> 58:54.110]  Go here right.
[58:54.110 --> 58:54.150]  Wait.
[58:55.430 --> 58:57.030]  I see a ship over there.
[58:57.490 --> 58:59.150]  Yeah, that's the ship from before.
[59:00.050 --> 59:00.810]  Yeah, that's good, Geoff.
[59:01.350 --> 59:03.710]  I'll get up in the crow's nest and see if I can spot it.
[59:06.470 --> 59:07.770]  There's something in the water.
[59:08.030 --> 59:08.590]  Where's that?
[59:11.130 --> 59:11.870]  Straight ahead.
[59:12.470 --> 59:13.410]  Just to the left.
[59:13.510 --> 59:16.190]  On that far left pointy island that's up there.
[59:17.450 --> 59:18.930]  There's something in the water.
[59:19.010 --> 59:20.090]  But I can't tell what it is.
[59:22.090 --> 59:23.390]  It's like moving around.
[59:28.300 --> 59:29.480]  I see what you're talking about.
[59:29.980 --> 59:31.560]  I think it's right in front of us.
[59:32.940 --> 59:35.280]  I think it's the Megalodon.
[59:35.300 --> 59:36.200]  I see the Megalodon.
[59:37.860 --> 59:38.700]  Straight ahead.
[59:38.940 --> 59:40.800]  He's right in front of that big rock.
[59:40.820 --> 59:41.560]  Slightly to the left.
[59:42.080 --> 59:43.240]  The big left rock.
[59:43.380 --> 59:47.240]  I don't see our ship, but I care more about killing him.
[59:47.680 --> 59:48.680]  The sail length.
[59:48.720 --> 59:49.200]  What do we want to do?
[59:50.380 --> 59:52.540]  Let's raise one more of the sails.
[59:52.640 --> 59:53.660]  We'll keep one down.
[59:53.840 --> 59:55.540]  Alright, I'm coming back down.
[59:55.660 --> 59:57.400]  I'm going to raise this front sail.
[59:58.380 --> 59:59.100]  Sounds good.
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.900]  Just so we can keep everything in the back.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.200]  Oh yeah, he's dead ahead.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.480]  He is dead ahead.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:08.820]  Is he?
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:09.900]  Yeah.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.180]  Oh, he has spotted us.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.460]  He is coming right for us.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.660]  Oh, I hear him.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.840]  Oh, he's coming.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.520]  Right ahead of us.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:20.740]  Shit.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.460]  I'm going to check the lower decks.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:25.560]  Hey, guess what?
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.360]  Hey, guess what? Three holes at least.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.300]  Where is he? On the left or the right?
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.920]  He's coming up on the left.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.540]  Oh god, we are filling with water.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.300]  I'm stuck.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.280]  I'm going to go ahead and kill him real fast.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.000]  Just kill him real fast.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.340]  Alright.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.940]  I think I got all the holes plugged.
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.100]  Nice shot, dude.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.380]  He's coming for us.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:56.760]  Oh shit.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.020]  God, I hit him hard there. That's great.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:00:59.980]  Other side.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.060]  To the left.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:05.160]  I'm going to tilt this to him.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.280]  Ow.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.320]  He bit us hard.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.400]  But we...
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.440]  I'm down.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.200]  Whoa.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.540]  I'm on top of the deck.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.100]  Getting water.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:19.700]  Thank you.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.160]  I'm reviving Nick and I'll come back and help with the water reference.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.000]  How's the water situation?
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.980]  It's bad. It's filling up.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:25.820]  You're up.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.140]  Alright, getting water.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.440]  I'm fixing the shit.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.040]  Water.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.540]  Nick, you on repair.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.880]  Where the fuck is it?
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:37.720]  Piece of shit.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.600]  Nick, that's where the babies are, right?
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.580]  Water.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.020]  Enemy's down.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.260]  This dickhead.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.860]  He's coming in for another bite.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.360]  Get ready.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.460]  Which side?
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.160]  We need more water out.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.980]  I'm working on it.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.260]  Water.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.140]  Oh my god.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.600]  It's every hole in the second deck also.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.040]  Yep.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.780]  We need bucket help.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.000]  I have to go back for more wood so I'm going to bucket.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:23.980]  I'll do wood.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:24.880]  I got five.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.840]  Is it down?
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.820]  I think there might be one down below.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.460]  I got it.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.340]  Oh, there's three.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:33.780]  Okay.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.320]  There's three at the front of the ship.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.780]  I got one.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:39.620]  Two.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.380]  Yeah, I'm coming back.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.060]  Three.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:45.920]  Another bite.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.440]  I hate these guys.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.000]  What is under the water attacking me?
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.860]  Alright, and...
[01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:56.230]  I think that's it.
[01:02:57.850 --> 01:02:58.370]  That's it.
[01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:00.510]  Yeah, we've stopped.
[01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.470]  I repaired the hole on the second level.
[01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:05.010]  Thank you.
[01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:07.350]  Ship is coming.
[01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.350]  What?
[01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.310]  Yeah, ship's coming.
[01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:13.590]  Looks like a dickhead.
[01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.990]  Yeah, I think we're still taking on a little bit of water.
[01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:17.010]  Yep, sure are.
[01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.330]  I'm second deck repairing still.
[01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:22.410]  And we still have a hole in the bottom.
[01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:22.950]  Yep.
[01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.830]  Alright, I'll go down.
[01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:28.230]  Oh!
[01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:30.350]  He's got electrocuted.
[01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:31.510]  Oh, I can hear them talking.
[01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:34.110]  Who uses comms in this game?
[01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:34.730]  What a dork.
[01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.690]  Oh man, I just fixed it all.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.370]  Okay, we need buckets.
[01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:42.170]  Yeah, yeah, I'm working.
[01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:43.630]  Hold on, I'm repairing this and then I got my bucket.
[01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:44.790]  Alright, bucket.
[01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:48.770]  Repairing the bottom hole.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.920]  These electric assholes are the worst.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.440]  They're the worst.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.060]  This fight wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for them.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.080]  Electric assholes.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.380]  Wish we could have one more crew, you know?
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.740]  If we just didn't have these little guys, it would be fine.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:09.880]  Okay, if we could get Nick out.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.220]  Yeah, right on the second deck.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.280]  There's a guy on top of him.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.360]  Bottom floor is fully repaired, I can get Nick.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:18.040]  I'm down the stairs, there's one on top of me.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.160]  He's almost dead.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.360]  Which set of stairs?
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.580]  Geoff, get Geoff.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.660]  I got him, I got him.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.640]  No way.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.380]  Wait, are you back?
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:27.840]  Alright, cool.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:28.520]  Yeah, I'm back.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.320]  Where the fuck is he?
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.100]  Where's the Meg?
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.100]  I think that what other boat was,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.420]  he got all fucked up and took him.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.520]  But, where's our stuff?
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.480]  Where's our stuff?
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.940]  Uh, let's see.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.020]  Did those pricks do that?
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.660]  Yeah, the Meg is on their boat now.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.580]  So let's head over to him.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.080]  Let's go get our stuff.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.440]  If we can still get it.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.320]  I saw it, but then like,
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.660]  everything went fucking crazy.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.000]  What are we looking for?
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.200]  Just sparkles in the water.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.020]  Got it.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.740]  What's that colorful thing
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.040]  to the front left of us?
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.840]  The pink and...
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.320]  That is a sunken ship, Trevor.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.100]  But not ours.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.600]  Got it.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.480]  You know, honestly, our stuff might have sunk by now.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:21.980]  Yeah.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.620]  There's like three boats
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.740]  on that Megalodon now.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.200]  Well, we might as well get in on the mix.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.280]  We don't want them to reap all the benefits
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.180]  of our hard work.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:33.460]  Okay.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.160]  Oh, never mind. They're fighting each other.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.740]  Oh my God. We don't want to go over there.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.520]  It is an AI ship,
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.300]  two human ships, and
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.140]  a Megalodon.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.780]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.580]  Let's just watch the carnage.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.420]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.520]  Oh, I'm going to the crow's nest.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.360]  What's this?
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.340]  Hey, what's this front left?
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.700]  It's just supplies. It's going to be food and
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:00.140]  ammo and shit.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.160]  I think the AI might be shooting at the Meg.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.160]  Oh, really?
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.520]  I think so. I think the sloop's attacking the Megalodon
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.600]  and so is the AI ship.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.760]  Our stuff's to the left!
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.220]  That's our shit.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.200]  Where?
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.640]  To the left that you're harpooning, I think.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.360]  It just seems like barrels.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.720]  Oh, it's just random barrels?
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.460]  Oh my God.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.160]  Oh, nope.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.980]  They're shooting at each other now.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:25.580]  The ships.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.760]  The Megalodon has peeled off from the fight.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.360]  Anything, Andrew? Can you see below?
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.940]  A lot of cannonballs.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.320]  We want to pull these up.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.100]  Uh-oh.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.240]  The other...
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.700]  The ship is now turned and engaged as well.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:44.540]  Oh, wow. This is so cool to watch.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.560]  Now all three are fighting.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.300]  Megalodon's going nuts over there.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.720]  We gotta get in on this.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.520]  The Megalodon has circled and is coming back for the human ship.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.480]  He's taking hits.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.620]  It's like he's stuck in the middle of a...
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.660]  of a fucking cannonball triangle.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.220]  Is the human ship the little one in the middle, Geoff?
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.000]  The human ship is the little one in the middle
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.500]  and the one that's parked to the right.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.660]  Oh, that's also a human ship?
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:06.880]  Yeah.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.000]  Okay.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.580]  Geoff, you want to grab any cannonballs over here from the left?
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.320]  In this barrel?
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:14.980]  Yeah.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.700]  Meg's coming for us!
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:21.500]  Meg's coming for us!
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:24.900]  How do I get down quick?
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.040]  Oh, shit. Come on.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.480]  No! Come on!
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:29.500]  No!
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.260]  Can we turn? Can we do anything?
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.860]  I can't get him.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:36.900]  Come on!
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.360]  Come on!
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.000]  Where are you, you prick?
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:41.760]  He went under.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.520]  Okay, let's go to the other side.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.180]  There he is!
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:45.460]  Where?
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.740]  He's coming in for a bite.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:50.900]  Yeah, he got us.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:52.380]  Alright, I'm going down.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.100]  I'll go repair.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.120]  Water.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.480]  Boy, the angles on the cannons really suck.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.440]  Yep, they suck fucking ass.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.020]  This must have been what it was like to really be a pirate.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.320]  Getting shots in?
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.220]  Yeah, I see it.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:10.820]  Left or right?
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.480]  He's going around the front. He's going to be over on the other side.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:16.700]  Hey, Nick, helping?
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.060]  Thank you.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.240]  God, we have so many holes.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.000]  Okay, he's coming around to the left.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.220]  Alright, I'm going to hit him.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.160]  Alright, we are down to the last six planks of wood.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.760]  Uh, I think we're okay right now, Andrew.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:33.260]  He's coming.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:35.600]  Give him everything.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:36.760]  Got him, got him. Nice.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:37.900]  We fucked him up.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.100]  Alright, let me go do some bucket.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.740]  Okay, we got guys.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.420]  That is, like, so low on the priority list.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.020]  It's like, the guy's coming.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.860]  You just go, well, I guess we'll just weather this storm.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.460]  God, I'm down.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:56.560]  I'm on the top deck.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.620]  Okay, I'm going to kill this...
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.820]  Andrew, can you get him while I'm...
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.900]  Alright, he's dead.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.440]  I think he's got me.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:04.680]  Water.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.720]  Sorry, I didn't know.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.440]  Come on, come on, come on.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:11.480]  Got you.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.920]  What side, what side?
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.780]  He's right in front of us right now.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780]  He's coming around to the left side.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.240]  I'll load up a cannon as well here.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.440]  Everybody on cannons?
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.180]  Oh, I don't have anything in that one.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.440]  Got him.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.520]  Got him.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.040]  Fire, fire, fire, fire.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.040]  Got him!
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.440]  Load up the cannons, load up the cannons.
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:37.620]  Loaded.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.560]  He's on the left side, he's on the right side.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.100]  Dead on.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.600]  Oh, he's taking a lot of hits.
[01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.030]  Just make sure your cannon's loaded up when you're done.
[01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.590]  Yep.
[01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:55.770]  All these are loaded.
[01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:58.670]  Okay, I'm focusing on the guys for a minute.
[01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.510]  Me too.
[01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.310]  Okay, we got him.
[01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:04.430]  Checking the basement.
[01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:05.890]  Guys, he's coming.
[01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:07.990]  Right side, right side, right side.
[01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:09.850]  I don't want to use it on him.
[01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.610]  No, there was no good shot.
[01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:15.930]  He's over here on the right.
[01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.450]  He's coming up on the back.
[01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:20.450]  Alright.
[01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.830]  King Crane said everything's okay.
[01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:23.590]  Okay, make sure you're all loaded up.
[01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:25.290]  Yep.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.820]  Who uses the voice function, you dork?
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.040]  Shut up.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:38.420]  Oh.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.700]  Here he comes.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:44.780]  Don't.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.420]  I don't know that this is going to let me hit him from this angle.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.640]  I'm off the boat!
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.500]  I'm about to hit him.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.460]  Eric overboard!
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:58.240]  I'm down.
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.700]  I'm also down on top.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:03.520]  Eric overboard!
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.660]  This is no good.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.140]  We gotta go help that guy with the galleon, fellas.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.400]  I'm ferryman.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.080]  Just a ferryman.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.560]  I'm swimming towards the boat.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.000]  I got bit by a shark.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.840]  Yeah, they'll do that.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:23.880]  Hey, King Crane is here.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.380]  We're really bad.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.740]  I'm doing my best, but it's just me.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.280]  I'm almost back.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.360]  Almost back.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.000]  We're sunk.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.900]  We're in class 13 and Bucket's bailed by crew.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:40.680]  I can't...
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.660]  We're gonna have to go back.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:48.340]  I don't think we're taking this guy out, boys.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:48.960]  We are.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.080]  We are.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:51.360]  M9.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:53.460]  We're definitely taking him out.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.240]  He's gotta be close to dead now.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.280]  You know, I feel like I've heard that once before.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.980]  We just have to kill him more than he kills us.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.100]  That was really good. We got fucked because that guy came on the boat
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.480]  that was asking for help with the thing
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.460]  and he killed two of you.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:08.940]  Oh, is that what happened?
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.620]  And then you got launched off, Eric.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.360]  I didn't know that there was a guy on the boat.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:16.740]  Okay.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.040]  That little dickhead.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.240]  Raise the anchor.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.800]  I can't wait to get all of our stuff back, guys.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.260]  All of our...
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.820]  All of that stuff from the beginning of the video
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.840]  belongs to DayZ now.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.460]  Oh, from 40 minutes ago?
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:29.700]  Yeah.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.280]  Load...
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.440]  Geoff isn't gonna help with the anchor, but he's got it.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.700]  I'm loading cannonballs.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:39.880]  Yeah, we could do that while we're moving to the...
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what if we do it now instead?
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.260]  What? There's fucking three of you doing it.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:44.960]  Yeah, but...
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.120]  Imagine if there's four!
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.820]  It's just great.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.720]  It's so good.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.500]  I'm gonna unload all the cannonballs then.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.120]  Thanks, man.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.560]  Nobody's asking you to unload the cannonballs.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.940]  No one wanted you to do anything with the cannonballs, period.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.020]  I'm undoing the work I did to help.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:13.580]  Why?
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:19.820]  Hey, Geoff, I'm with you.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.440]  You should do that.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:21.400]  Why, Geoff?
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.220]  What's wrong with the both of you?
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.180]  I don't want to be made fun of.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:29.360]  You should work for a different company.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.320]  I own this company.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.160]  What are you talking about?
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.820]  So do the rest of us.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.340]  That's why we're making fun of your ass.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.320]  Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.140]  Okay, bye.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.060]  See you later.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.240]  I feel like this situation is untenable.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:51.400]  I'm gonna have to go back to land and start a new life for myself on there.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.740]  I don't understand why any of this is happening.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.540]  Why are mommy and daddy fighting?
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.700]  We're not fighting.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.280]  I'm separating so that we don't fight.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.680]  Oh, no. Was it me?
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.740]  Yeah, it was all of you.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.800]  You're not supposed to actually say yeah.
[01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:15.210]  Alright, well that got real.
[01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:19.550]  He swam by the mermaid.
[01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:21.510]  He doesn't want anything to do with the mermaid.
[01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.670]  The mermaid's not doing me any good.
[01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:24.830]  She's not going to get me to land faster.
[01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:27.850]  Geoff, please.
[01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:29.890]  I can't. It's too late now.
[01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:31.730]  The damage has been done.
[01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:33.270]  The damage has been done.
[01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:35.230]  All of our cannons are loaded.
[01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:37.770]  They're not.
[01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.310]  But that's Geoff's job.
[01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:42.450]  Well, he's not here.
[01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:45.570]  I'll load them in absentia.
[01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:47.610]  Hmm.
[01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:49.310]  I'm going to give myself a new hairstyle.
[01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:51.670]  Geoff, please.
[01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:53.150]  You don't think I should have a new hairstyle?
[01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:55.350]  Everybody else got new hairstyles.
[01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.470]  I didn't.
[01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:59.070]  Well, there you go. Some people did.
[01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:01.170]  Some people did.
[01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:04.010]  There's a...
[01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.770]  I can get a tattoo.
[01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:06.990]  Another ship that's...
[01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.330]  Where's that?
[01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:08.530]  Where's that?
[01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:10.570]  It's coming up...
[01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:12.650]  to the Megalodon spot.
[01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:15.530]  I don't see them.
[01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:16.490]  I just see them on the map.
[01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.350]  If you look at the map board, you can see...
[01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:21.650]  I'm going to play this game for as long as I can without looking at the map board.
[01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:22.530]  Yeah, that's fair.
[01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:26.030]  Hello, sir.
[01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.670]  How are you doing?
[01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:27.970]  Lorena.
[01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:29.750]  I got an email from Chili's.
[01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:33.170]  I got an email from Chili's.
[01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:35.770]  Mr. Chili emailed me.
[01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.610]  Direct communication with Chili's.
[01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.130]  Every time we drive by that...
[01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:42.330]  We drive by one, Archie screams and points at something.
[01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:43.190]  Ah! Pepper!
[01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:47.210]  We're getting a little close to these rocks on the left.
[01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:48.710]  There's also rocks on the right.
[01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.390]  Maybe just a hair to the right?
[01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:54.050]  Yeah, we're going to go...
[01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.590]  I'm tilting.
[01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:56.550]  A little right.
[01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:57.730]  A little right?
[01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:01.050]  I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:02.350]  No, you're doing great.
[01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:03.030]  You're doing great.
[01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.470]  Just a little right.
[01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:10.390]  If Andrew was in charge of the Titanic, they never would have sunk.
[01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:11.770]  Look at this ship. Look at that.
[01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:13.490]  There's a ship straight ahead.
[01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:14.610]  Andrew, incredible.
[01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:17.330]  We have a ship dead ahead.
[01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:21.410]  Is that a person?
[01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:22.950]  That is a person ship.
[01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:25.550]  I'm going to call it a person people ship.
[01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:26.850]  A person people ship.
[01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:31.190]  Uh...
[01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:32.490]  You're heading straight for it.
[01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:33.150]  Yep.
[01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:35.870]  The megalodon has to be here.
[01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:38.710]  Whenever you're done with your beach stuff, Geoff, it would be wonderful to have you.
[01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:41.830]  Oh, now you want me.
[01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:43.950]  Geoff, we always see how it is.
[01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:47.170]  Just to be clear, we wanted you the whole time.
[01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:48.590]  I see how it is.
[01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:49.910]  Well, what if I'm fishing?
[01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:52.830]  Yeah, you can be fishing too.
[01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:54.610]  That's a different game, but whatever you want.
[01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:56.570]  Is this guy going to fight us?
[01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:57.390]  I would love to have you here.
[01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:58.970]  I think this guy is probably going to fight us.
[01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:05.810]  I guess I'll come save you guys.
[01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:07.770]  Please do.
[01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:12.410]  I guess I'll come rescue you from yourselves.
[01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:16.530]  Excuse me, I need to go save my idiot friends.
[01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:17.270]  Can you thank you?
[01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:18.870]  What is that in the water?
[01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:20.110]  Where?
[01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:21.830]  Oh, it's a...
[01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:22.290]  Another ship!
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.920]  What? Who's on your boat?
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:29.780]  Hey!
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.360]  It's a skeleton!
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:34.520]  No, it's a guy.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.180]  Die!
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:44.860]  If somebody could raise a sail, that would be great as well.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:50.900]  Raising a sail.
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.640]  Alright, anchor's up.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:56.860]  Thank you.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.140]  How did he get on our boat?
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.160]  He hopped off his and then swam to the ladder.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.160]  Oh, really?
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.900]  Seems like a really long way to do that.
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.500]  Or he could have shot himself over too.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:09.600]  Coward!
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.760]  Hey, there's the Meg right in front of us.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.340]  Oh, I do see him.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:15.860]  Wow.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.240]  There he is!
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.480]  We're going to get him, this is the time.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.040]  Oh, another dude's on the boat!
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.240]  Kill him!
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.060]  Who's that?
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.780]  Some dickhead.
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:32.140]  He's going under.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.340]  I'm down.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.200]  What?
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.120]  I'm down.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:41.840]  I got Eric.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.460]  He's down.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.960]  Thank you.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:49.720]  I will eat. I don't have food.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.720]  Now I have bunion.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.760]  Can I raise anchor again?
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.320]  Oh, for God's sake.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.680]  This game sucks.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.080]  I don't know, I feel like there's only three of us raising the anchor.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.280]  Oh, I got the bird!
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.760]  The other one of us what, could have eaten while we were moving?
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.220]  Uh, no.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.340]  No, I don't think so.
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.100]  That's what I've heard.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:15.020]  Alright, I'm going fishing!
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:17.640]  Oh, for God's sake.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:17.860]  Where?
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.640]  Where did the little...
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.360]  Where'd the Megalodon go?
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.000]  Little Megalodon.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:26.980]  Little Megalodon.
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.140]  Here we go, get ready.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.100]  We're about to enter the fight.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.340]  There he is.
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.460]  Eric's off the boat.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.140]  I told you I'm going fishing!
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.940]  I thought you were doing a bit.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.420]  Well, it's a bit.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.440]  Real funny.
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:43.680]  It's coming.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.100]  Here we go.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.340]  About to pop him.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.220]  Damn it, we don't have the range.
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:50.200]  Oh, he's going to ram us.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.420]  He's pushing us.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.320]  Fine.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.500]  I'll save you guys.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.200]  Alright, that's three hits, four hits direct.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:00.920]  Five hits.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:01.780]  Six.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.380]  Nice, good work.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.200]  Alright, I'm going to go bucket.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.120]  Whoa, he turned around!
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.620]  He just head whipped us!
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.140]  I didn't know he could do that!
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:14.700]  I didn't know he could do that either!
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.160]  That's not how water works.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.280]  We were like, oh yeah, dude, we got him.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.340]  Because he's going by us.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.540]  Never mind.
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.900]  He's in front of us.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:29.620]  Alright.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:32.820]  Great job.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.480]  Good buckets.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.780]  A lot of hole problems.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.080]  Yeah, the little guys are on here now.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:40.940]  Arrgh!
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:41.720]  Arrgh!
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.320]  Water's out.
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:45.640]  Water's out.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.560]  What is attacking me?
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.320]  Alright, they're dead.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.280]  No, they're above me.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.380]  Nobody on my floor.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:55.700]  Loading up.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.940]  Fuck him up!
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.700]  Alright, we're good.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.980]  We need to load up the cannons.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:05.760]  He's coming in for a bite.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:07.780]  Nice.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.560]  Right or left?
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.320]  Oh my god, he's down!
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:11.420]  Oh my god, he's down!
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.380]  Oh my god, he's down!
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.140]  Okay, let's tilt so we can
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.960]  grapple his stuff and then we'll
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.800]  cash out.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.720]  Okay, his body's gonna sink down.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:26.240]  Should I go down there and grab it manually?
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.700]  Good fucking work. If you want, you can.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.540]  We did it. It only took
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:31.000]  three rounds.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.860]  Oh, I see it.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.620]  Yeah, he's gonna sink.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.440]  And then...
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.280]  Shooting with a harpoon.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:41.560]  Yeah, his body will sink
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.560]  and then loot will come up.
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.820]  Or it'll just vanish.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.720]  Should we anchor here so we can get
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.400]  everything or what?
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.000]  We don't need to anchor.
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.380]  His body flipped up.
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.180]  Jesus Christ.
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:56.640]  He's gone.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.560]  There's nothing to grab so far.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.680]  I don't see anything.
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:01.920]  I see it!
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.500]  I see it. Grabbing.
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:04.640]  Grabbing.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:07.980]  If I grab
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.000]  you here, I'm sorry, Geoff.
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.760]  I'm just shooting crazy
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.180]  style.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.900]  Oh, there's so much coming up.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.480]  Geoff, there's a shark. Careful.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.740]  I'm not scared of sharks.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:30.420]  I've fought a megalodon
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.240]  seven times.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.360]  I've fought a megalodon
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.280]  seven times. Oh no,
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:35.860]  Geoff, look out!
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.100]  There's a shark right there.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.960]  It's a flesh wound, dude.
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:42.740]  Can we get everything?
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:43.920]  Thank you.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.960]  Let's get out of here. We did it, boys.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]  Cash us out. Let's go.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.120]  Let's aim
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.600]  north. What do you want us to do?
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.740]  You want us to set
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:56.640]  sails or what?
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.380]  You can drop sails, sure.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:01.620]  Spinning.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:03.720]  Got it.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.440]  Oh, let's get
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.860]  out of here. Let's cash.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.240]  Drop the sails down
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.580]  and then set the angle to catch the wind.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:12.540]  Yeah.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:16.960]  Got it.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.480]  I'm not going to drop it all the way because it's too hard
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.200]  to see for the pilot.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.880]  Yeah. Thank you.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.880]  Let me check the body, see if we're taking on any water.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.400]  Oh no. No, we're good.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.580]  What's oh no? Cracking!
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.760]  What? No, we have to get out of here.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.180]  No, no, no. We have to get out of here.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.360]  Okay. Tilt the sails.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.540]  Full sails down.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.660]  We could possibly sail out
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.300]  of this, but... Got it.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.320]  Got it. Setting sail.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.920]  Oh my god.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.500]  All sails down.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.280]  All sails down.
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:49.340]  Motherfucker.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:51.980]  Oh shit.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:54.300]  Don't worry.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.060]  I can't even tell which way the wind's going now.
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:57.260]  Oh, now I can.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.860]  Okay, we got holes in the boat.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.980]  Oh no! Fuck!
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.740]  We just did the other thing.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.560]  I guess the shark had a friend.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.580]  What the fuck? Repairs?
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.980]  I'm repairing. Repairs are underway.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:15.900]  Cracking's like, you killed my boyfriend.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:16.780]  Water. Alright.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.160]  Do we need to be steering the ship or anything?
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.060]  Are we okay? I already actively
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.320]  aimed it. Now I'm just trying to tilt the sails
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.520]  to get us wind. Looks like we're okay.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.660]  We just need to get out of this black surface. Yeah, looks like we're good down here.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.880]  No more water, we're good.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.480]  Repairing the second floor.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.320]  Good idea.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.100]  Come on, come on. Repairing hull.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:40.100]  Let us out, let us out, let us out. I hit him.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:44.800]  God damn.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.680]  Let us go,
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:48.300]  damn you.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.980]  Oh shit. Oh, there's one right next
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:52.520]  to us.
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:54.260]  Oh,
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.460]  grabbed onto us. No! What?
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.880]  Which one? No, where? Where is it?
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.540]  Up at the captain's wheel.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:02.580]  Oh my god!
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.120]  Okay, repairs.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.680]  I'm trying to get him off.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:09.720]  I'm going down.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.540]  Yeah, just as somebody calls out
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.360]  repairs, I just want to make sure somebody's doing it.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.600]  I'm hurt, I'm down on the second deck.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.600]  I'm not up. Okay, Nick's dead.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.380]  Alright, I'm getting him. Someone getting the revive?
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.600]  I'm getting the revive.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.580]  I got it.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.380]  Okay, Geoff, bucket please.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.380]  Okay. Alright, I'm back. I'm gonna repair.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.180]  Okay, Nick, you repair.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.320]  I got bucket. Here I come.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:35.900]  How do we get...
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:37.740]  When he grabs us, how do we get him off?
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.900]  You gotta damage him.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:43.460]  I'm hitting him.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.680]  Alright, I think...
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.040]  Okay, Nick and Geoff, could you two focus on repairs
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.860]  and bucketing? And Eric, could you help me
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:50.980]  with trying to knock off this?
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.600]  I'm hitting him in the head.
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.800]  No damages right now.
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.200]  Oh, there we go.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:25:59.820]  Damages.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:00.900]  He might be letting go.
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:03.640]  Got him.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.200]  That's it, he's letting go. Let's get out of here.
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.500]  Where's the closest exit to our left?
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.800]  Let's aim the sails.
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.200]  Yeah, tilt the sails to the right, please.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:15.680]  I'm working on it.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:16.320]  I'm coming.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.380]  You can't look away.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:20.380]  I got the mid one.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.320]  Oh, it takes so long to turn.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.120]  Come on.
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.700]  Catch the wind, damn you.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.600]  Alright, got that one.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.600]  All the way to the right.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:36.840]  I'm overboard!
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.480]  It ate Nick.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.160]  It sucked up Nick.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.100]  We're so close to escaping.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.680]  We're right on the edge.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.040]  So am I!
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.820]  Let me grab the boat!
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.040]  Come on, come on, come on.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:56.180]  Can we harpoon Nick?
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.200]  Yes, I'm up.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:26:59.120]  I got it.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.380]  Fuck, it hit us and spun us.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.200]  Fuck.
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:04.780]  Okay, tilting us back left.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.520]  I'm gonna repair.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.760]  I'll repair, you scoop.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.380]  I gotta repair above.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.860]  Hold on, let me get the water.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.200]  There's a second floor.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.880]  I'm setting the angle.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.700]  We're almost there.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.140]  Just let us out.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.980]  We can't win. That's big.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:28.500]  We're almost out.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:29.300]  Come on.
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:32.080]  This is like a disaster movie.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:33.680]  Like Titanic.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:35.760]  We're out.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.640]  We got a human ship to the left.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:37.880]  No!
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:39.800]  No!
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.060]  Has anybody considered that it might have not been the iceberg, but actually a Kraken?
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.560]  I'll talk to my friend Robbie. I'm sure he has a conspiracy theory about it.
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.420]  Okay, so now what?
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.340]  Let's just try to sail, I guess.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:57.940]  Load the cannons.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:58.440]  Load the cannons.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:01.660]  This one's not.
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.460]  Okay, raise sails.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:05.260]  Raise sails.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.520]  Raise sails.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.980]  Raising sails. I'm on the middle.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:10.400]  I'm on the back.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:16.660]  Raising sails.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.100]  What was that?
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.500]  What's happening?
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.060]  Wait, are we here?
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.220]  Yeah, we're here.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.120]  Now what?
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.040]  Now let's sail and make sure they don't steal our ship while we're sailing.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.880]  So do we have to take this stuff off or what?
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.720]  Yep, take this stuff off and then run to...
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.840]  I'm gonna repair the boat while you guys do that.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:36.880]  I'll take it.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.880]  Got it.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.300]  Wow, that was...
[01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:48.790]  Where the hell are we taking this stuff, Andrew?
[01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:50.730]  It depends on the...
[01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:53.070]  Okay, Nick, so we're taking it to this port.
[01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:54.370]  Or this little tent.
[01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:56.750]  Are you guys dropping...
[01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:58.570]  Am I dropping stuff off the ship or am I taking it to the dock?
[01:28:58.570 --> 01:29:00.730]  Yeah, just put it on the dock if you can.
[01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:01.210]  Got it.
[01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:03.570]  Oh, boy.
[01:29:04.930 --> 01:29:05.650]  Oh, boy.
[01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:08.050]  Be on the lookout for the other people.
[01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:09.790]  They're also here.
[01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:14.110]  Whoa, you can see that kraken in the background, dude.
[01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:17.570]  It's got like 40 tentacles in the air waving at us.
[01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:18.430]  You guys see that?
[01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:20.810]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:23.650]  Do you think half the people who were just on this beach were like,
[01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:24.750]  Huh, that sucks for that guy.
[01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.490]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:28.170]  Nothing we can do, fellas.
[01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:31.070]  Oh, they made it back. Let's buy their stuff.
[01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:33.470]  Did we get something in the water?
[01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:35.330]  It might have fallen in the water.
[01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:35.910]  Okay.
[01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:40.150]  I'm trying to just get everything off the boat without getting off the boat.
[01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:43.570]  Where do I sell the disgraced coral skull?
[01:29:44.410 --> 01:29:45.730]  Uh, I'll show you.
[01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:47.950]  That's probably the creepy person, right?
[01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.850]  Yeah.
[01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:51.250]  So you're gonna wanna go up to...
[01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:51.990]  Do you see my name, Nick?
[01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:53.130]  Yeah, I see you.
[01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:57.950]  So the skulls go up the stairs to the right.
[01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:01.310]  And then...
[01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:02.390]  In this tent.
[01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:03.890]  Or in the bottom level of this boat.
[01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:05.490]  Who do I sell this stuff to?
[01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:07.710]  I just have like a chest.
[01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:08.610]  Just like a regular chest.
[01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:11.770]  Uh, the gold hoarder tent on the beach.
[01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.490]  If you keep going down.
[01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:14.850]  Where?
[01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:15.830]  And then straight.
[01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:19.250]  Here, I'll take something there.
[01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:21.110]  It sounds like a great idea.
[01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:25.210]  So it's this tent with the key flag.
[01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:26.830]  Is that it? Is everything off the boat?
[01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:28.090]  I believe so.
[01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:31.650]  Where's the scale of barnacle bread?
[01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:32.270]  Or bread?
[01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:33.930]  Oh, you can't sell it.
[01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:34.770]  Yeah.
[01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.850]  Open.
[01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.950]  Okay.
[01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:41.930]  You can sell the chest now.
[01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:45.830]  Just me and Andrew pressing buttons at the same time.
[01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:46.030]  Yeah.
[01:30:47.630 --> 01:30:48.830]  Where are the gold hoarders?
[01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.750]  I thought I...
[01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:52.630]  Oh, maybe I missed them. Maybe they're over there.
[01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:55.130]  I think that's all I have.
[01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:55.430]  Cool.
[01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:59.310]  We still have to sell this one stupid thing and then we're good.
[01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:00.990]  It's the tent over here, Geoff.
[01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:02.150]  It's the gold hoarder.
[01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:04.370]  Oh, I thought I went there.
[01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:05.130]  Let me try again.
[01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:08.410]  No, I can't sell this here.
[01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:09.930]  Can you drop it?
[01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:16.990]  Oh, it's uh...
[01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:18.770]  It's uh... whatever.
[01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.290]  The delivery people.
[01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.510]  Uh...
[01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.330]  Thank God Andrew's here.
[01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:25.990]  Gotta go.
[01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:26.990]  There we go.
[01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:28.990]  What a run, guys.
[01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:32.310]  There's so many things that I like about this game until you're done
[01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:34.330]  doing the fun stuff of this game
[01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:36.250]  and then it's the chores and I hate this game.
[01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:40.590]  When you have to start doing chores, oh my god.
[01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:42.610]  I just want the monkey. I'm hanging out with the bird.
[01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:43.490]  I'm having fun.
[01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:46.430]  I like the chore part when you're having to run and turn stuff in
[01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:48.310]  because there's always the fear that somebody's gonna come up
[01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:50.550]  from behind you and kill you and take it
[01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:52.070]  and just turn it in.
[01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:53.990]  There's always another
[01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:57.050]  successful adventure of the seas.
[01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:57.910]  Killed a megalodon.
[01:31:58.690 --> 01:32:00.790]  Insane. We lost all of our stuff.
[01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.470]  What's gonna happen next?
[01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:05.090]  We got more stuff. That's the way of the game.
[01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.870]  Have to kill a kraken next, I guess.
[01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:09.150]  Yeah, let's go for the kraken next time.
[01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:10.130]  Great. Alright.
[01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:12.850]  Thanks so much for watching. Make sure to check out our Patreon at The Regulation Pod.
[01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:14.930]  New podcasts, drafts,
[01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:15.830]  all sorts of stuff.
[01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:18.230]  But until then, thanks for watching.
[01:32:18.230 --> 01:32:19.070]  Bye!
[01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:20.490]  Goodbye!
