[00:00.000 --> 00:04.140]  All right, we're going to start streaming here in three, two, one, rolling.
[00:06.340 --> 00:09.320]  Let's stream. Did you do that to fuck with me?
[00:10.520 --> 00:11.180]  No, I was sick of it.
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.000]  Or did you just start rolling?
[00:12.560 --> 00:13.500]  Just started rolling.
[00:14.700 --> 00:17.800]  So you muted for the sync?
[00:18.520 --> 00:21.160]  What? Hey Gavin, when we count down, what do you think that's for?
[00:21.620 --> 00:26.400]  The mute was the panic mute while I was trying to open Audacity.
[00:26.920 --> 00:28.380]  So you let me
[00:29.200 --> 00:31.260]  go through with that charade.
[00:33.040 --> 00:34.980]  Yeah. Yeah.
[00:35.680 --> 00:39.580]  But, you know, I'll hit you up on the second of two times that we do it.
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.260]  Awesome. Well, assuming, you know, it doesn't get deleted somewhere along the way.
[00:45.020 --> 00:47.300]  And then I'll delete it before the backup runs.
[00:47.700 --> 00:50.740]  And then it will still have it because we got it on YouTube.
[00:52.100 --> 00:53.420]  Check out next week's episode.
[00:53.860 --> 00:57.980]  There's so much, so much sass just dripping out of everything
[00:57.980 --> 00:59.940]  said by everybody on this stream today.
[01:01.500 --> 01:02.480]  Whoo. Yeah.
[01:03.000 --> 01:03.960]  Hopefully, Eric.
[01:05.660 --> 01:07.900]  Oh, I'm fine. Just the last two minutes.
[01:08.040 --> 01:08.680]  Very stressful.
[01:09.440 --> 01:11.100]  Well, we do it twice. We do it twice.
[01:11.180 --> 01:16.480]  And the reason is that the second time is if something happens to the first time.
[01:16.940 --> 01:18.340]  Right. It's actually for drift.
[01:18.460 --> 01:21.280]  I mean, it's any kind of drift that might occur in the hour,
[01:21.420 --> 01:23.360]  which is the hour was the important part.
[01:23.380 --> 01:26.900]  And what I'm told is that we do a tail sync because after an hour,
[01:26.900 --> 01:30.000]  potentially there's drift and we try not to do the same.
[01:30.340 --> 01:31.500]  Oh, right. OK, cool. Right.
[01:31.720 --> 01:33.660]  But you can sync. Uh-huh.
[01:33.780 --> 01:35.600]  Yes, we can sync. Right, right, right.
[01:35.740 --> 01:38.300]  Yes, we can sync. But that but then we'll still have drift.
[01:38.460 --> 01:40.240]  Yeah. There's no drift.
[01:40.900 --> 01:43.000]  Oh, there is. Elbow deep, daddy.
[01:43.220 --> 01:44.540]  Thanks for the subs.
[01:45.680 --> 01:47.200]  You love to see it.
[01:50.660 --> 01:51.400]  Happy Friday.
[01:52.460 --> 01:54.700]  And if you're watching this later, sucks it's Tuesday.
[01:55.160 --> 01:56.560]  Hey, guys, welcome to the stream.
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.120]  It's Eric. It's Geoff.
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.500]  It's Gavin. It's Nick.
[02:00.600 --> 02:02.200]  Andrew might be here in a little bit.
[02:02.880 --> 02:05.320]  Thank you, Elbow Deep Daddy, for the gifted subs, guys.
[02:05.540 --> 02:09.560]  It's a Friday where Schindler's Fist is here, gifting subs, going crazy.
[02:10.140 --> 02:12.660]  And we're playing. What is this one? Ultimate Monkey.
[02:12.880 --> 02:14.680]  What is this one? Ultimate Raccoon.
[02:16.600 --> 02:17.520]  Ultimate Sheep Raccoon.
[02:17.600 --> 02:18.660]  We're going to be playing that today.
[02:18.920 --> 02:21.640]  As we were getting started, everything was going well.
[02:21.680 --> 02:25.800]  Then everything fell apart as Denise Crite with the gifted subs.
[02:25.800 --> 02:26.900]  Wow. Everything's coming together.
[02:26.980 --> 02:29.840]  Gavin, do you want to pick a creature and then we can get this thing going?
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.020]  Yeah. Am I not picked?
[02:32.260 --> 02:33.080]  I picked the chicken.
[02:34.260 --> 02:35.380]  Doesn't show up on my screen.
[02:35.680 --> 02:37.660]  You know, I don't see you picking the chicken on my screen.
[02:38.140 --> 02:39.880]  Oh, he's gone. He's gone.
[02:39.880 --> 02:40.980]  He's left. Hold on.
[02:41.900 --> 02:43.740]  Oh, my God.
[02:44.460 --> 02:48.540]  How do how do people watch this show?
[02:48.820 --> 02:51.320]  Five subs from malignant slut rot.
[02:51.540 --> 02:52.660]  Thank you so much.
[02:53.220 --> 02:54.860]  Are you guys ready? Slut rot.
[02:54.860 --> 02:56.500]  All right. Here we go.
[02:56.760 --> 02:58.260]  Slut rot. We're starting the game.
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.720]  You guys want to go to the farm? Take it back to the farm?
[03:00.740 --> 03:01.840]  Yeah, sure. It's farm time.
[03:02.320 --> 03:04.020]  I'd love to. We're going to be our first farm.
[03:04.380 --> 03:05.880]  Yep. All right.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.560]  I guess the new version, new demo came out.
[03:07.680 --> 03:08.800]  But now you can have five people.
[03:08.940 --> 03:11.260]  But then Andrew couldn't play, so it's still four.
[03:11.720 --> 03:13.020]  Yes, it is.
[03:13.180 --> 03:16.200]  You know, I will say, though, despite the fact that we're missing Andrew right now,
[03:16.240 --> 03:19.180]  we had a hell of a productive recording day already.
[03:19.640 --> 03:21.100]  It's been a great Friday.
[03:23.100 --> 03:23.960]  I'm going to put that there.
[03:24.480 --> 03:26.440]  Guys, we need to get somewhere, I think.
[03:26.640 --> 03:28.440]  So, guys, we need to get guys.
[03:28.540 --> 03:29.780]  We got to get somewhere.
[03:29.940 --> 03:31.280]  Guys, I'm thinking about somewhere.
[03:31.500 --> 03:33.140]  Guys, I think we need to go.
[03:33.400 --> 03:35.040]  I assume I just go right on the stick, right?
[03:35.060 --> 03:36.120]  That's how I think so.
[03:36.600 --> 03:37.640]  Oh, my mom. Oh, yeah.
[03:37.680 --> 03:38.860]  Every single week.
[03:39.580 --> 03:40.660]  Thanks so much. Oh, no.
[03:40.940 --> 03:42.680]  Oh, no. Off the map balls.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.140]  How do you know?
[03:45.380 --> 03:47.080]  They look so sad when they die.
[03:48.100 --> 03:48.600]  Oh, no.
[03:49.100 --> 03:50.700]  My chicken gets like old.
[03:51.200 --> 03:52.340]  Yeah, it's the button.
[03:53.240 --> 03:54.360]  I think it's just right.
[03:54.520 --> 03:54.820]  It is right.
[03:54.960 --> 03:57.680]  I think, yeah, I think maybe you just go right and then jump.
[03:58.480 --> 03:59.280]  That's what it was.
[04:00.020 --> 04:03.680]  Oh, by the way, if you're wondering, guys, let's tell everybody who we are.
[04:04.580 --> 04:05.300]  We're Regulation.
[04:06.360 --> 04:07.480]  Okay, I'm the monkey.
[04:07.740 --> 04:10.280]  This is you got the name burn up, right?
[04:11.240 --> 04:12.220]  Where, right now.
[04:12.520 --> 04:13.260]  Where? Where go?
[04:14.360 --> 04:16.140]  Remember when you picked the character right before we started?
[04:16.300 --> 04:16.620]  I put it in the bottom somewhere.
[04:19.120 --> 04:20.760]  When it pops up, look at the top.
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.600]  Look, now it's there.
[04:23.060 --> 04:23.820]  Now it's there.
[04:23.880 --> 04:25.180]  Raccoon is the alligator.
[04:25.920 --> 04:26.740]  The green alligator.
[04:26.780 --> 04:27.360]  I'm the raccoon!
[04:27.860 --> 04:28.840]  No, no, no, no, no!
[04:29.320 --> 04:29.540]  Yes!
[04:29.960 --> 04:30.100]  Yes!
[04:30.940 --> 04:31.000]  Yes!
[04:31.980 --> 04:32.760]  Backflip tricks!
[04:32.940 --> 04:33.260]  Boom!
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.020]  Raccoon and monkey, friends again.
[04:35.100 --> 04:36.200]  100% friends.
[04:36.540 --> 04:37.080]  Hell yeah!
[04:37.660 --> 04:38.620]  Hey Gavin, will you do me a favor?
[04:39.280 --> 04:39.480]  Yeah.
[04:40.120 --> 04:41.900]  Will you press record on this game?
[04:43.700 --> 04:44.520]  Just in case.
[04:45.460 --> 04:47.080]  Oh, I was rolling the backup, yeah.
[04:47.420 --> 04:48.200]  Oh, I like...
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.000]  Did you sync to that?
[04:50.300 --> 04:51.380]  I'll do it here, Nick.
[04:52.080 --> 04:54.240]  I'm also recording, don't worry.
[04:54.740 --> 04:55.020]  Great.
[04:55.100 --> 04:55.520]  Oh, you are?
[04:55.660 --> 04:56.280]  Oh, I love you.
[04:56.480 --> 04:57.160]  I mean, what's the point?
[04:57.340 --> 05:00.380]  This is going out, like, on Twitch.
[05:00.540 --> 05:01.560]  We just have it on Twitch, right?
[05:02.140 --> 05:02.340]  Yeah.
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.020]  Don't we do?
[05:05.120 --> 05:06.000]  I'm just checking.
[05:07.080 --> 05:07.440]  Jetpack!
[05:08.480 --> 05:09.200]  The jetpack!
[05:10.900 --> 05:12.120]  Stop it, stupid!
[05:12.280 --> 05:12.840]  No, no, no!
[05:13.660 --> 05:14.020]  Yes!
[05:14.320 --> 05:14.400]  Die!
[05:15.440 --> 05:15.800]  Yeah!
[05:17.400 --> 05:17.760]  Frontflip!
[05:18.020 --> 05:18.860]  Stupid-ass chicken.
[05:18.860 --> 05:19.660]  You dumb-ass bird.
[05:19.720 --> 05:20.020]  You died.
[05:20.080 --> 05:20.820]  You went over it, idiot.
[05:21.420 --> 05:22.620]  Oh, you can go over.
[05:22.880 --> 05:23.440]  I suck.
[05:24.400 --> 05:25.240]  I wanna win.
[05:26.260 --> 05:27.100]  Hey, you know what?
[05:27.160 --> 05:30.240]  It takes time to figure it out, then you figure it out, and you love it, baby.
[05:31.580 --> 05:33.400]  Or you're playing Tony Hawk.
[05:33.880 --> 05:35.080]  Yeah, or you're playing Tony Hawk.
[05:35.680 --> 05:36.940]  What does frog do?
[05:37.420 --> 05:38.200]  I miss Andrew.
[05:39.240 --> 05:40.000]  I think...
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.580]  I think frog makes tongue go, and it can grab you.
[05:45.340 --> 05:48.640]  Like, you hit A when you're in, like, his vicinity, and his tongue grabs you.
[05:49.100 --> 05:49.460]  Oh.
[05:49.960 --> 05:50.320]  In a good way?
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.020]  I don't know what that does.
[05:51.180 --> 05:52.940]  Uh, I mean, in a way where it grabs you.
[05:54.100 --> 05:55.680]  Do you wanna get grabbed by a tongue frog?
[05:56.280 --> 05:57.940]  Yeah, do you wanna get grabbed by a tongue frog?
[05:58.460 --> 05:58.940]  Tongue frog.
[05:59.100 --> 05:59.520]  I don't know.
[05:59.700 --> 06:00.520]  See, I've still got my jetpack.
[06:01.580 --> 06:01.820]  Ah!
[06:03.100 --> 06:03.820]  Oh, shite!
[06:03.940 --> 06:04.500]  Oh my god.
[06:05.180 --> 06:05.440]  No!
[06:05.700 --> 06:05.960]  No!
[06:06.720 --> 06:07.020]  Go!
[06:07.240 --> 06:07.560]  No!
[06:08.260 --> 06:08.980]  Stupid alligator.
[06:09.220 --> 06:09.780]  Dumb-ass fucking lizard.
[06:09.780 --> 06:10.720]  Die, alligator, die!
[06:10.840 --> 06:11.300]  Stupid alligator.
[06:11.300 --> 06:11.920]  All those break.
[06:12.100 --> 06:12.320]  Stupid lizard.
[06:12.440 --> 06:12.980]  Die, lizard.
[06:13.420 --> 06:14.080]  Die, lizard.
[06:14.780 --> 06:15.420]  Die, lizard.
[06:15.800 --> 06:17.640]  Go up the fucking thing, alligator!
[06:17.640 --> 06:18.660]  There we go.
[06:19.080 --> 06:20.160]  Stupid, stupid alligator.
[06:20.420 --> 06:21.000]  Go over it.
[06:21.260 --> 06:22.340]  Go over it, dumb lizard.
[06:23.120 --> 06:23.560]  Boo!
[06:24.940 --> 06:25.040]  Boo!
[06:25.600 --> 06:28.220]  Juniorbug8 says, I want Eric to lose so bad.
[06:28.620 --> 06:29.120]  Hell yeah, Juniorbug8.
[06:29.120 --> 06:29.780]  That's too bad I'm winning, baby.
[06:30.080 --> 06:30.480]  Hell yeah.
[06:30.480 --> 06:31.540]  I'm winning, baby.
[06:32.500 --> 06:33.140]  Welcome to hell.
[06:33.220 --> 06:33.960]  This is your hell.
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.140]  Fifteen months.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.520]  These are the people I've subbed for fifteen months.
[06:39.040 --> 06:40.300]  Is that how long you've been doing this?
[06:40.540 --> 06:40.860]  Jesus.
[06:41.060 --> 06:41.740]  That's nuts.
[06:41.980 --> 06:44.100]  That means we can't break up for fifteen months.
[06:45.660 --> 06:46.260]  Is that what that means?
[06:46.560 --> 06:47.020]  Oh, yeah.
[06:48.300 --> 06:49.100]  Oh, my God.
[06:49.180 --> 06:50.080]  That's dangerous, guys.
[06:50.900 --> 06:51.520]  Which thing?
[06:52.420 --> 06:53.440]  The spiky deal.
[06:54.260 --> 06:55.480]  The big spike gimmick.
[06:56.480 --> 06:58.600]  Well, Geoff and I have decided the game's over.
[07:02.020 --> 07:02.760]  Oh, dude.
[07:02.840 --> 07:03.900]  This lizard's a wizard.
[07:04.480 --> 07:05.240]  Yeah, there you go, Geoff.
[07:05.260 --> 07:05.620]  Down there.
[07:05.920 --> 07:06.900]  What does lunch do?
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.860]  I think you eat it and it makes you okay.
[07:10.540 --> 07:12.460]  Yeah, I think it keeps you going throughout the day.
[07:15.180 --> 07:17.620]  It's like two idiots in poetry.
[07:19.020 --> 07:21.120]  Oh, fuck me.
[07:21.120 --> 07:21.800]  Didn't know it.
[07:22.200 --> 07:22.740]  No!
[07:23.260 --> 07:23.560]  No!
[07:24.320 --> 07:24.860]  Go!
[07:25.240 --> 07:26.140]  Go, raccoon!
[07:26.460 --> 07:27.120]  No, raccoon!
[07:27.840 --> 07:28.200]  No!
[07:29.360 --> 07:29.900]  Yes!
[07:30.200 --> 07:30.840]  Bye, man!
[07:31.160 --> 07:31.860]  Stupid lizard.
[07:32.080 --> 07:32.840]  Dumbass lizard.
[07:32.940 --> 07:33.320]  I hate him.
[07:33.400 --> 07:33.980]  I hate the lizard so much.
[07:33.980 --> 07:34.760]  Die, Geoff, die!
[07:35.260 --> 07:35.840]  I can't.
[07:36.240 --> 07:38.800]  Me and Santa1563 hate the lizard.
[07:38.980 --> 07:39.520]  We both hate the lizard.
[07:39.580 --> 07:40.420]  We love the lizard!
[07:40.420 --> 07:41.180]  That's right, Santa.
[07:41.340 --> 07:42.220]  We hate the lizard.
[07:42.220 --> 07:43.320]  Forget him.
[07:44.440 --> 07:45.500]  Stupid monkey.
[07:47.180 --> 07:49.700]  I can't get past the first jump.
[07:50.180 --> 07:51.020]  Well, you suck.
[07:51.620 --> 07:51.840]  Hit A.
[07:53.000 --> 07:54.260]  Say that to my face.
[07:55.580 --> 07:56.420]  Hit A.
[07:56.640 --> 07:56.800]  Hit A.
[07:56.940 --> 07:57.280]  Hit A.
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.440]  No, not that.
[08:03.540 --> 08:06.000]  Repeat it back to me, what were you supposed to say?
[08:06.480 --> 08:06.780]  No!
[08:10.080 --> 08:10.780]  Oh, balls!
[08:12.220 --> 08:13.540]  You dumbass monkey.
[08:13.780 --> 08:15.120]  I think that sounds like an Andrew.
[08:15.860 --> 08:16.500]  Andrew, are you here?
[08:16.720 --> 08:18.220]  Oh, no, the lizard made it!
[08:18.400 --> 08:19.220]  Oh, yeah!
[08:20.760 --> 08:21.720]  Chomp, chomp!
[08:22.240 --> 08:23.780]  Chomp my way to victory!
[08:25.300 --> 08:26.740]  Andrew's here, but I don't hear him.
[08:30.680 --> 08:33.060]  What did Andrew do to his desk today?
[08:33.860 --> 08:34.120]  Poor Andrew.
[08:34.120 --> 08:34.360]  Poor Andrew.
[08:34.800 --> 08:38.400]  We recorded so much today, too, and it was, like, all fine.
[08:38.540 --> 08:39.740]  We recorded today.
[08:40.080 --> 08:40.420]  Hey!
[08:40.420 --> 08:40.840]  Hey!
[08:40.840 --> 08:41.020]  Hey!
[08:44.680 --> 08:46.620]  Are you recording your mic?
[08:49.850 --> 08:50.630]  And you can sync with me at the end.
[08:50.630 --> 08:53.930]  Don't worry, Gavin wasn't recording at the beginning, so it's fine.
[08:54.250 --> 08:56.310]  Yeah, but he led us to believe he was, which is worse.
[08:56.430 --> 08:58.330]  It's true, he tricked Nick, it was a Nick trick.
[08:58.510 --> 09:00.310]  Well, there was the chance that I would have it rolling.
[09:00.310 --> 09:02.550]  Oh, he definitely, yeah, he did a Nick trick. It was pretty bad.
[09:03.270 --> 09:04.170]  What were the chances?
[09:04.570 --> 09:07.070]  The chance was that I would hit recording before three was said.
[09:07.590 --> 09:08.350]  What was the percentage?
[09:09.390 --> 09:09.710]  20?
[09:09.710 --> 09:09.790]  20?
[09:11.270 --> 09:11.990]  Sounds right.
[09:12.490 --> 09:13.710]  No! No!
[09:15.230 --> 09:15.630]  Raccoon!
[09:15.630 --> 09:17.450]  Oh, you stupid dumbass!
[09:17.770 --> 09:18.310]  No, Jack!
[09:18.310 --> 09:18.910]  Come on, Raccoon.
[09:19.030 --> 09:19.810]  Okay, here we go, here we go.
[09:20.550 --> 09:24.070]  You're right about the whole getting the hang of the game and then liking it thing.
[09:24.270 --> 09:25.690]  No, no, no, no!
[09:25.730 --> 09:26.790]  You've already got the hang of it?
[09:27.290 --> 09:29.030]  Well, I don't know, I seem to be...
[09:29.030 --> 09:32.250]  He seems to be crushing you, you dumbass bird.
[09:32.690 --> 09:33.830]  Could you give me some hang?
[09:37.970 --> 09:38.730]  Ooh, coin!
[09:39.710 --> 09:41.330]  Can you give me some hang?
[09:42.410 --> 09:43.610]  Oh, we both got coins!
[09:49.690 --> 09:50.630]  Take your pick.
[09:51.470 --> 09:52.610]  Speaking of recording.
[09:53.250 --> 09:53.510]  Yeah.
[09:53.670 --> 09:57.950]  We recorded the top 20 greatest video games of all time today.
[09:58.450 --> 10:00.190]  What a piece of supplemental.
[10:01.010 --> 10:01.690]  I can't wait.
[10:01.690 --> 10:02.470]  Where do you even begin?
[10:03.970 --> 10:05.730]  I guess reaction is gonna be so fun.
[10:06.810 --> 10:11.070]  Yeah, people are really gonna love it and agree with all of our picks and be super supportive.
[10:12.550 --> 10:14.630]  No, no, no, no, no!
[10:15.650 --> 10:16.390]  That's tough.
[10:16.810 --> 10:17.810]  I live! I died.
[10:21.710 --> 10:23.930]  Mythical Jade said, got my Gerpler today.
[10:24.350 --> 10:34.590]  We also recorded episode 68 of the podcast today and our streak of continuing to record good ones in a row with no duds continues, I think.
[10:34.910 --> 10:35.890]  Yeah, we've been hot, baby.
[10:38.010 --> 10:39.950]  Lots of education in today's one.
[10:40.270 --> 10:41.270]  Oh, we learned a lot.
[10:41.270 --> 10:42.450]  Well, Andrew learned a lot.
[10:42.590 --> 10:42.630]  We did!
[10:43.430 --> 10:44.470]  No, I think we all did.
[10:46.090 --> 10:47.130]  A lot of education.
[10:48.890 --> 10:49.570]  Gotta go!
[10:50.450 --> 10:51.770]  Oh my god, I got...
[10:51.770 --> 10:52.210]  No!
[10:53.610 --> 10:54.390]  Raccoon lived!
[10:54.570 --> 10:54.970]  No!
[10:55.090 --> 10:55.590]  The frog!
[10:56.130 --> 10:57.510]  Oh, this is bad for Nick.
[10:58.010 --> 10:58.950]  Bad for Nick.
[10:59.530 --> 11:01.290]  I frogged myself.
[11:01.850 --> 11:02.110]  No!
[11:02.270 --> 11:02.530]  Bull!
[11:02.630 --> 11:02.850]  No!
[11:03.750 --> 11:04.190]  No!
[11:05.630 --> 11:06.690]  What are those?
[11:06.990 --> 11:07.330]  No!
[11:07.470 --> 11:08.050]  What's the goo?
[11:08.490 --> 11:09.110]  That's honey.
[11:09.110 --> 11:09.530]  No!
[11:10.570 --> 11:11.550]  Back of cock.
[11:11.750 --> 11:11.830]  No!
[11:12.930 --> 11:13.150]  No!
[11:16.350 --> 11:18.710]  I'm just chomping shaft from behind.
[11:19.730 --> 11:20.390]  Is that worse?
[11:21.070 --> 11:21.630]  I don't know.
[11:24.150 --> 11:25.250]  Andrew, are you still with us?
[11:25.530 --> 11:28.930]  Back of cock would be the sweatiest, stinkiest part of cock.
[11:29.330 --> 11:29.870]  Okay, there we go.
[11:30.230 --> 11:31.170]  Is back under?
[11:31.630 --> 11:32.190]  Yeah, it's under.
[11:34.190 --> 11:36.730]  It's the part that's like touching your taint and stuff, you know?
[11:37.350 --> 11:37.810]  Oh, this is a mess.
[11:37.810 --> 11:40.090]  Let us know in chat if you've got a clean rear shaft.
[11:40.650 --> 11:41.730]  Yeah, how's your shaft doing?
[11:45.230 --> 11:46.570]  Yeah, why not? I like chaos.
[11:46.750 --> 11:48.190]  Oh my god, this is crazy.
[11:49.150 --> 11:50.030]  That's crazy!
[11:51.390 --> 11:53.690]  What part is the back of the penis?
[11:53.970 --> 11:57.550]  I think just the part that hangs, but if I'm spacing away from you.
[12:00.110 --> 12:00.830]  Dumbass bird.
[12:02.590 --> 12:04.110]  I'm in the floor!
[12:04.590 --> 12:05.030]  No!
[12:05.270 --> 12:06.270]  No, the raccoon!
[12:06.410 --> 12:07.050]  No, the raccoon!
[12:07.810 --> 12:08.870]  I think the gator just won.
[12:09.210 --> 12:11.510]  Yeah, I think that might do it for us.
[12:12.570 --> 12:16.090]  I think he just gatored on.
[12:16.710 --> 12:18.010]  Oh, Jorky Bilfus.
[12:18.430 --> 12:19.790]  Oh my god, not even close.
[12:19.990 --> 12:22.330]  Dude, Jorky Bilfus is here and Gavin's here. Is that okay?
[12:23.610 --> 12:26.010]  I love the Jorkster, the Jorkmeister Bill Floyd.
[12:26.350 --> 12:27.250]  Well, there you go.
[12:27.910 --> 12:28.590]  There's the winner.
[12:28.950 --> 12:30.650]  Arthritic Gamer, also a winner.
[12:30.910 --> 12:32.110]  Okay, Andrew, join the game.
[12:32.430 --> 12:33.150]  Ultimate gator.
[12:34.550 --> 12:35.610]  Okay, I'm gonna join.
[12:36.270 --> 12:36.530]  Okay.
[12:36.530 --> 12:39.430]  If his audio cuts out, I'm gonna laugh harder than I've ever laughed in my life.
[12:40.790 --> 12:41.670]  I won't.
[12:42.470 --> 12:44.990]  That'll make me laugh even harder knowing you're not laughing.
[12:45.530 --> 12:46.450]  It's Jackist!
[12:46.770 --> 12:47.610]  Are you Jackist?
[12:47.910 --> 12:50.190]  Nope, it's just the code is on the screen.
[12:50.510 --> 12:51.430]  Yep, yep.
[12:52.450 --> 12:54.150]  Hey, Jackist, get out of here.
[12:54.950 --> 12:55.670]  Hey, Prick, leave.
[12:56.110 --> 12:58.630]  Hey, legitimately leave.
[12:59.290 --> 13:00.270]  Leave or die.
[13:00.910 --> 13:01.810]  Like, what are you doing?
[13:02.330 --> 13:05.450]  Why would this be a thing that I want to do? Oh boy, it's gonna...
[13:05.450 --> 13:06.350]  I'm gonna flip out.
[13:06.350 --> 13:10.090]  If you're dumb enough to put the code up, I think anyone's allowed in.
[13:10.870 --> 13:13.650]  Andrew told me he's watching. I thought he was already in.
[13:14.610 --> 13:15.330]  There's Andrew.
[13:15.590 --> 13:17.910]  Guys, there's the code. Don't join it.
[13:18.950 --> 13:20.910]  Jesus Christ with five gifted.
[13:21.810 --> 13:23.590]  Jackist, get back in here, you little rascal.
[13:23.990 --> 13:24.790]  Where's the code?
[13:24.870 --> 13:25.590]  I don't see the code.
[13:26.650 --> 13:27.530]  Where is the code?
[13:28.410 --> 13:29.190]  I don't see a code.
[13:29.790 --> 13:30.650]  We might just be public.
[13:30.850 --> 13:32.530]  Eric might have just double-dumbed it.
[13:32.790 --> 13:34.250]  Yeah, I don't see a code here at all.
[13:34.250 --> 13:36.450]  I only saw the code because I could see Eric's screen.
[13:37.670 --> 13:38.470]  That's why...
[13:39.370 --> 13:41.150]  I don't know what else to tell you.
[13:41.410 --> 13:43.810]  It's a private lobby, and it has a code.
[13:44.430 --> 13:46.370]  I'm streaming, and there's no code on my screen.
[13:46.830 --> 13:48.370]  I don't know how Jackist did that.
[13:49.510 --> 13:51.110]  Jackist is a legend, I agree.
[13:51.690 --> 13:53.470]  Jackist, come back and tell us how you did it.
[13:53.790 --> 13:54.650]  Jackist, come back.
[13:54.970 --> 13:56.270]  Wait, why couldn't I pick anything?
[13:56.730 --> 13:57.610]  Why didn't I pick anything?
[13:57.730 --> 13:59.290]  Wait, what the fuck is going on?
[13:59.610 --> 14:00.230]  Where are you guys?
[14:00.630 --> 14:01.250]  How are there only...
[14:02.670 --> 14:03.350]  What is...
[14:03.350 --> 14:03.830]  What?
[14:04.010 --> 14:04.870]  Am I spectating?
[14:05.390 --> 14:06.210]  Why am I spectating?
[14:06.290 --> 14:06.910]  What's going on?
[14:07.210 --> 14:07.470]  Hold on.
[14:07.470 --> 14:08.050]  This is gonna be good.
[14:09.110 --> 14:11.210]  Hang on, we gotta wait for Nick to figure this out.
[14:11.350 --> 14:12.570]  Alright, I'm just putting it down.
[14:13.470 --> 14:13.910]  Chill out.
[14:16.230 --> 14:18.010]  Why can only three of us do something?
[14:18.430 --> 14:19.350]  Maybe it's just to limit...
[14:20.070 --> 14:21.150]  A is jump.
[14:22.650 --> 14:23.610]  Oh my god!
[14:24.230 --> 14:25.670]  Okay, don't do that.
[14:27.310 --> 14:28.530]  Oh, shit.
[14:28.630 --> 14:29.350]  How do I...
[14:30.070 --> 14:30.770]  There's sprint?
[14:31.770 --> 14:32.670]  How does this work?
[14:36.290 --> 14:36.610]  No!
[14:36.610 --> 14:38.390]  I think you have to hit A on that thing to ride it.
[14:38.470 --> 14:38.790]  Oh, yeah.
[14:39.570 --> 14:42.410]  But it's like a specific time I think you have to do it.
[14:42.450 --> 14:42.750]  Got it. Okay.
[14:43.350 --> 14:44.970]  Okay, just pan, pan, pan a snail eye.
[14:45.410 --> 14:46.350]  Now I can't move.
[14:47.610 --> 14:48.690]  It's only three people.
[14:48.790 --> 14:50.070]  It's two or three at a time, it appears.
[14:50.290 --> 14:50.450]  Yeah.
[14:51.170 --> 14:51.490]  Interesting.
[14:51.690 --> 14:53.930]  Maybe it's just too crazy otherwise.
[14:54.250 --> 14:55.270]  It must be, right?
[14:55.370 --> 14:56.070]  It must be.
[14:56.290 --> 14:56.730]  Right there.
[14:56.770 --> 14:57.430]  It's just too much.
[14:57.470 --> 14:57.630]  No!
[14:58.270 --> 14:58.930]  Don't listen to him.
[14:59.170 --> 15:00.750]  Yeah, why would you listen to the monkey?
[15:00.750 --> 15:03.810]  Why would you listen to the guy who died at the...
[15:03.810 --> 15:05.290]  Queef Wellington, five gifted, thank you.
[15:05.530 --> 15:06.450]  Thank you so much.
[15:09.750 --> 15:11.410]  Queef Wellington just keeps gifting.
[15:14.090 --> 15:15.090]  Jesus Christ.
[15:15.310 --> 15:15.770]  Oh, no!
[15:20.210 --> 15:21.210]  Oh, no.
[15:21.790 --> 15:22.790]  Oh, my God!
[15:23.950 --> 15:27.430]  I think you have to land on it with your tires a certain way.
[15:27.930 --> 15:28.130]  Whoa!
[15:28.130 --> 15:30.170]  We hate the bird.
[15:30.250 --> 15:30.870]  We hate the bird.
[15:30.990 --> 15:31.550]  Boom!
[15:32.350 --> 15:34.230]  Really, really good job, bird.
[15:34.550 --> 15:34.810]  Whoa!
[15:35.370 --> 15:36.570]  Really great job, bird.
[15:36.710 --> 15:38.610]  I got such a weird safety bump.
[15:40.230 --> 15:42.350]  I hate the bird so much.
[15:43.370 --> 15:46.610]  GuchaScooper and Shippy282929, what?
[15:46.890 --> 15:47.950]  Thanks for the gifted subs.
[15:51.410 --> 15:51.970]  Jetpack.
[15:52.250 --> 15:52.730]  Thank you so much.
[15:53.670 --> 15:54.450]  Thank you!
[15:54.930 --> 15:55.690]  Thank you.
[15:59.390 --> 15:59.890]  Whoa!
[16:00.130 --> 16:01.670]  Oh, Geoffco.
[16:02.110 --> 16:02.490]  No!
[16:03.810 --> 16:04.310]  Raccoon!
[16:05.010 --> 16:06.990]  I missed my timing.
[16:08.010 --> 16:09.610]  Raccoon! Raccoon! Raccoon!
[16:12.790 --> 16:13.790]  Thank you!
[16:14.230 --> 16:15.130]  Die, raccoon, die!
[16:15.630 --> 16:16.130]  Die, bitch!
[16:17.010 --> 16:17.190]  No, trick!
[16:17.190 --> 16:18.050]  Oh, I think Raccoon's got it.
[16:18.210 --> 16:18.630]  Nice!
[16:23.030 --> 16:25.410]  Is there like a speed up in this game?
[16:25.530 --> 16:26.310]  What are the controls?
[16:26.770 --> 16:27.150]  A is jump.
[16:27.150 --> 16:28.150]  A is jump.
[16:29.110 --> 16:29.810]  And that's it.
[16:29.970 --> 16:31.270]  I think that's all I know.
[16:31.530 --> 16:31.770]  Okay.
[16:34.830 --> 16:36.170]  Aw, man, I don't get to pick this time.
[16:36.330 --> 16:37.250]  Aw, I don't get to pick.
[16:38.010 --> 16:39.390]  I want to pick so bad.
[16:40.450 --> 16:41.010]  Oh, alright.
[16:43.890 --> 16:45.110]  Monkey got springs.
[16:46.070 --> 16:46.430]  Yeah!
[16:47.730 --> 16:49.170]  Oh, it's going to be a crazy spot.
[16:49.390 --> 16:50.070]  Oh, some springs!
[16:50.910 --> 16:51.530]  Oh, boy.
[16:51.670 --> 16:53.030]  I just want to add some fun.
[16:53.070 --> 16:53.750]  What does that do?
[16:54.550 --> 16:54.910]  Bouncy?
[16:55.070 --> 16:55.290]  Spring.
[16:58.310 --> 16:59.670]  Let's find out.
[17:00.130 --> 17:01.030]  Oh, no.
[17:01.150 --> 17:02.070]  Barely bouncy.
[17:03.230 --> 17:05.270]  No, no, no, raccoon, raccoon, raccoon!
[17:06.330 --> 17:06.590]  No!
[17:07.970 --> 17:09.990]  The jetpack shite!
[17:11.170 --> 17:11.870]  Yay!
[17:12.670 --> 17:14.350]  Two, two, three, umbrella to victory!
[17:15.290 --> 17:18.270]  Oh, Andrew flew in.
[17:18.410 --> 17:19.170]  That was cool.
[17:19.710 --> 17:21.150]  Mary Poppins this shit.
[17:21.750 --> 17:21.950]  Yep.
[17:23.650 --> 17:26.490]  Oh, that's a shift, a seismic shift.
[17:27.430 --> 17:27.910]  416.
[17:28.710 --> 17:29.730]  Look at that.
[17:30.350 --> 17:31.450]  I got this now.
[17:31.830 --> 17:35.150]  Eric is in a growly mood today, the regulation moon girl says.
[17:35.490 --> 17:36.770]  Let's see, what does this one do?
[17:37.510 --> 17:38.630]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[17:39.730 --> 17:40.130]  Alright, boys.
[17:41.670 --> 17:42.930]  He didn't hear what you said either.
[17:43.590 --> 17:44.570]  Oh, I heard.
[17:48.250 --> 17:49.630]  You and I apologize, Eric.
[17:50.250 --> 17:51.410]  Apology not accepted.
[17:52.390 --> 17:53.470]  You know what? Rescinded.
[17:53.950 --> 17:54.650]  That's fine.
[17:56.070 --> 17:56.610]  Fuck you.
[17:57.470 --> 17:59.690]  Oh, I smashed right into my own punch glove.
[18:01.250 --> 18:01.610]  Yes.
[18:07.290 --> 18:08.270]  There we go.
[18:10.910 --> 18:11.910]  That's a trick, baby.
[18:12.050 --> 18:12.590]  You went over it.
[18:12.850 --> 18:14.010]  You can't fly over the top.
[18:14.090 --> 18:14.230]  No!
[18:15.890 --> 18:17.350]  You played with us the first time.
[18:17.470 --> 18:17.850]  Look at that, baby.
[18:17.850 --> 18:19.150]  That was like eight months ago.
[18:19.250 --> 18:20.770]  Get that chicken in the dirt.
[18:21.310 --> 18:22.890]  Put that fucking chicken in the dirt.
[18:22.890 --> 18:24.310]  Oh, dirt chicken.
[18:24.430 --> 18:24.730]  Put him in the pot.
[18:25.030 --> 18:26.750]  Zephyr Juxton says, I did.
[18:26.850 --> 18:29.810]  I knew AH in middle school, but dropped out around 2026.
[18:32.210 --> 18:34.090]  This guy's pre-dropping out.
[18:34.510 --> 18:36.930]  I think I was a decade typer there.
[18:37.810 --> 18:40.870]  This guy's pre-dropping out.
[18:41.610 --> 18:42.890]  I'm out of here next year.
[18:42.910 --> 18:44.890]  I'm going to probably drop out in 2027.
[18:45.970 --> 18:47.090]  I'll see you guys later.
[18:47.430 --> 18:47.630]  Eventually.
[18:48.870 --> 18:49.730]  There we go.
[18:53.030 --> 18:54.770]  Oh, I got fucked by the screen.
[18:55.190 --> 18:56.710]  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
[18:56.730 --> 18:57.670]  Oh, no, wait, did I make it?
[18:58.130 --> 18:59.170]  Oh, me and the monkey.
[18:59.270 --> 18:59.870]  Look, we're going to kiss.
[19:00.230 --> 19:00.290]  Hello.
[19:02.330 --> 19:02.690]  What?
[19:03.170 --> 19:03.870]  Oh, yeah.
[19:04.170 --> 19:07.030]  Oh, man, it gave me post-mortem because I tried to do it.
[19:07.230 --> 19:08.350]  I tried to do a trick.
[19:09.490 --> 19:10.710]  I forgot you knew tricks.
[19:10.890 --> 19:11.770]  How do you do tricks?
[19:12.050 --> 19:13.970]  X button is for tricks in the air.
[19:14.330 --> 19:15.650]  Oh, what does this do?
[19:15.670 --> 19:16.470]  Oh, it just blows shit up.
[19:16.530 --> 19:16.710]  Okay.
[19:17.090 --> 19:17.930]  And the TV does.
[19:18.810 --> 19:20.370]  Four items and three people.
[19:20.910 --> 19:21.070]  Yeah.
[19:21.190 --> 19:21.530]  Yes.
[19:22.450 --> 19:23.230]  You know what?
[19:23.430 --> 19:24.610]  Let's have some fun.
[19:25.170 --> 19:25.990]  Oh, finally.
[19:26.490 --> 19:27.270]  A nice change of pace.
[19:27.630 --> 19:28.610]  Who blew that up?
[19:31.210 --> 19:32.530]  Andrew's having fun.
[19:37.410 --> 19:38.570]  Andrew's having fun.
[19:39.370 --> 19:39.610]  Andrew's having fun.
[19:39.610 --> 19:41.150]  He wants the world to know.
[19:41.710 --> 19:43.150]  Gonna have some fun.
[19:43.830 --> 19:45.250]  I hate this glove thing.
[19:47.970 --> 19:49.570]  Well, I did a trick right into the dirt.
[19:49.810 --> 19:50.530]  All right, that was a good job.
[19:52.300 --> 19:52.590]  No!
[19:55.290 --> 19:55.870]  Raccoon!
[19:58.510 --> 20:00.030]  Look at Andrew.
[20:03.310 --> 20:05.850]  Yeah, Andrew's got one move and he loves it.
[20:06.210 --> 20:07.090]  That's all I got.
[20:07.690 --> 20:10.290]  A seismic shift as the monkey eats dirt.
[20:10.690 --> 20:11.130]  Look at that!
[20:11.190 --> 20:12.090]  I got the trick point.
[20:12.930 --> 20:13.410]  Nice.
[20:13.910 --> 20:15.490]  Gonna have to kill a raccoon.
[20:17.260 --> 20:18.270]  Can't turn me into a hat.
[20:19.390 --> 20:20.030]  Ooh.
[20:20.150 --> 20:20.610]  Ooh.
[20:21.030 --> 20:22.090]  Oh, Gavin took it first.
[20:22.290 --> 20:22.810]  All right.
[20:23.070 --> 20:24.030]  TV party.
[20:24.310 --> 20:25.250]  Oh, shit.
[20:25.790 --> 20:27.710]  Geoff, we're gonna have a TV party tonight.
[20:28.450 --> 20:29.090]  Quincy.
[20:29.790 --> 20:30.570]  That's incredible.
[20:35.130 --> 20:36.510]  Oh, Gavin.
[20:36.550 --> 20:37.630]  You suck.
[20:37.950 --> 20:41.490]  Oh, you classic Gavin trash can placement.
[20:43.410 --> 20:44.050]  Classic.
[20:44.690 --> 20:45.350]  It is!
[20:45.630 --> 20:46.250]  It's your move.
[20:47.050 --> 20:48.050]  Can we go under it?
[20:48.390 --> 20:48.530]  Yeah.
[20:48.890 --> 20:49.570]  Okay.
[20:51.970 --> 20:52.590]  Oh, that.
[20:52.990 --> 20:53.670]  No!
[20:56.010 --> 20:56.690]  No!
[20:59.210 --> 21:00.330]  Oh, I didn't...
[21:00.330 --> 21:00.670]  No!
[21:01.310 --> 21:02.550]  I mistimed my buzz.
[21:02.610 --> 21:03.490]  I got TV electrocuted.
[21:04.290 --> 21:04.590]  No!
[21:05.650 --> 21:05.910]  No!
[21:08.030 --> 21:08.790]  Oh, I'm back.
[21:09.690 --> 21:10.070]  Oh, no!
[21:10.590 --> 21:11.110]  TV!
[21:11.170 --> 21:12.490]  TV party!
[21:12.490 --> 21:16.330]  Me and Gavin had a TV party.
[21:16.650 --> 21:18.630]  How many times does that chicken have to die?
[21:20.570 --> 21:22.370]  Coffee at TV.
[21:24.570 --> 21:25.930]  Ooh, power-ups time.
[21:26.170 --> 21:26.370]  Power-ups.
[21:26.610 --> 21:26.810]  Ooh.
[21:27.770 --> 21:28.510]  Oh, yeah.
[21:29.210 --> 21:30.270]  Increase your speed.
[21:30.410 --> 21:31.350]  Always active.
[21:31.890 --> 21:32.190]  Hell yeah.
[21:32.370 --> 21:32.670]  Jump higher.
[21:32.830 --> 21:33.270]  Always active.
[21:33.410 --> 21:34.210]  Right, Nick?
[21:34.630 --> 21:35.210]  Me and you, bud.
[21:35.810 --> 21:36.730]  Me and you.
[21:36.790 --> 21:37.390]  Let's get some speed.
[21:37.810 --> 21:38.290]  Speed!
[21:38.810 --> 21:38.970]  Ow.
[21:39.250 --> 21:39.730]  No!
[21:42.830 --> 21:43.250]  No!
[21:44.610 --> 21:45.030]  Yes!
[21:45.590 --> 21:46.530]  Oh, no!
[21:47.390 --> 21:47.990]  My bike!
[21:49.470 --> 21:51.070]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[21:53.650 --> 21:54.890]  One move and it works.
[21:55.310 --> 21:56.510]  I got the chicken!
[21:57.390 --> 21:58.810]  I think you killed yourself again.
[21:59.030 --> 21:59.570]  No, I'm alive.
[21:59.810 --> 22:00.790]  I think I bumped into Andrew.
[22:00.950 --> 22:01.350]  I thought I saw you falling off.
[22:01.350 --> 22:01.770]  Got a chicken.
[22:03.490 --> 22:03.910]  Boom!
[22:04.390 --> 22:05.390]  Oh, I need to catch up.
[22:06.370 --> 22:07.070]  I guess I didn't.
[22:08.470 --> 22:11.310]  Oh, there's the trick for the raccoon, baby.
[22:11.310 --> 22:12.530]  Oh, I'm fifth.
[22:13.670 --> 22:17.050]  Put the fucking chicken in the dirt.
[22:17.370 --> 22:18.170]  Three rounds?
[22:18.630 --> 22:19.650]  I'm winning, baby.
[22:19.690 --> 22:20.370]  Time to lock in.
[22:20.790 --> 22:22.890]  A buried chicken is a wasted chicken.
[22:24.950 --> 22:27.730]  A buried chicken is a wasted chicken.
[22:27.970 --> 22:28.890]  Oh, my God.
[22:29.370 --> 22:30.570]  Oh, this is going to get dangerous.
[22:31.110 --> 22:32.290]  Oh, can I not rotate this?
[22:33.150 --> 22:33.670]  Oh, man.
[22:33.670 --> 22:37.090]  I think you can put it sideways on stuff.
[22:37.530 --> 22:38.130]  Oh, okay, I got you.
[22:38.130 --> 22:40.130]  Like, if you set it down towards...
[22:40.670 --> 22:42.290]  Yeah, it'll adjust.
[22:44.210 --> 22:45.410]  Oh, my God.
[22:46.690 --> 22:47.650]  That's crazy.
[22:48.390 --> 22:49.790]  It's a nut puncher at the end.
[22:50.390 --> 22:50.950]  Yeah, it is.
[22:52.090 --> 22:52.730]  Watch your balls.
[22:55.290 --> 22:56.450]  Oh, forgot about that again.
[22:56.570 --> 22:56.790]  God damn it.
[23:00.130 --> 23:01.210]  No, raccoon!
[23:01.630 --> 23:02.710]  No, raccoon, no!
[23:04.770 --> 23:07.190]  I can't get past this fucking thing right now.
[23:07.190 --> 23:09.270]  Oh, the monkey slid in.
[23:09.390 --> 23:09.850]  Yeah, he did.
[23:11.190 --> 23:13.170]  The monkey's going to take first place.
[23:13.630 --> 23:15.470]  Geoff is struggling.
[23:16.650 --> 23:17.450]  You got it, Geoff.
[23:17.570 --> 23:18.130]  There it is.
[23:18.330 --> 23:18.570]  Nice!
[23:19.110 --> 23:20.270]  Oh, shit!
[23:21.090 --> 23:21.530]  Oh, Geoff!
[23:22.110 --> 23:22.450]  Geoff!
[23:23.110 --> 23:24.290]  He's just hit nuts!
[23:26.170 --> 23:26.550]  He's out!
[23:26.970 --> 23:27.830]  I'm trying, I'm trying.
[23:28.410 --> 23:30.150]  Queef Wellington, 5-4 gifted.
[23:30.410 --> 23:30.850]  Incredible.
[23:33.030 --> 23:34.910]  Man, Queef Wellington's got deep pockets today.
[23:34.930 --> 23:35.570]  Going for it.
[23:36.510 --> 23:38.530]  Oh, I was really worried about where that was going.
[23:38.630 --> 23:39.570]  Yeah, that could have been...
[23:41.110 --> 23:41.910]  Two rounds remain.
[23:41.990 --> 23:42.950]  I think it's me and Gavin here.
[23:43.190 --> 23:43.750]  Alright, Gavin.
[23:44.470 --> 23:45.910]  Oh, we had the same idea.
[23:47.050 --> 23:47.890]  Oh, God.
[23:48.430 --> 23:49.670]  Oh, point it back, point it between you.
[23:49.750 --> 23:49.970]  Yes!
[23:58.080 --> 23:58.880]  Admiral Chop.
[23:58.900 --> 23:59.280]  No!
[24:00.320 --> 24:00.720]  Insane.
[24:01.280 --> 24:03.540]  It's the only way I know how to beat this course.
[24:05.360 --> 24:07.100]  Well, now you'll have to find another way.
[24:07.880 --> 24:08.280]  Fuck.
[24:08.740 --> 24:11.940]  I want to get the bloody umbrella next time, it looks amazing.
[24:12.180 --> 24:13.500]  Oh, shit, I'm in the fucking cannon.
[24:13.500 --> 24:13.920]  How am I?
[24:14.040 --> 24:14.840]  Oh, God damn it.
[24:15.280 --> 24:15.800]  Oh, get through!
[24:16.000 --> 24:16.220]  Okay.
[24:16.440 --> 24:16.800]  No!
[24:18.020 --> 24:18.560]  Come on.
[24:18.800 --> 24:19.280]  Oh, you fell!
[24:19.640 --> 24:20.580]  I'm alive, I'm alive!
[24:20.780 --> 24:21.220]  Get over there!
[24:21.380 --> 24:22.520]  I'm in two buckets?
[24:23.180 --> 24:24.080]  What's going on?
[24:25.020 --> 24:25.700]  No, they're right there!
[24:25.720 --> 24:26.600]  Can anyone see me twice?
[24:26.840 --> 24:28.240]  Wait, which one am I?
[24:28.280 --> 24:30.200]  How is there double Gavin?
[24:30.620 --> 24:32.560]  Does anyone know which one is me?
[24:33.060 --> 24:35.120]  You better hit the button and find out.
[24:36.060 --> 24:38.220]  What if I'm the middle one?
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.560]  Wait, where are you?
[24:43.840 --> 24:44.720]  He's in hell!
[24:44.900 --> 24:45.880]  He's in hell!
[24:46.020 --> 24:48.300]  I've only got a little gummed up in the barrel.
[24:48.580 --> 24:50.100]  I think there's three of me now.
[24:52.360 --> 24:53.660]  Get off me, me!
[24:53.960 --> 24:55.220]  Me, let me go!
[24:57.700 --> 24:58.740]  Can you time out?
[25:01.020 --> 25:02.520]  Do your tricks!
[25:02.760 --> 25:03.600]  Do the tricks!
[25:03.920 --> 25:04.080]  No!
[25:05.120 --> 25:06.140]  Come on, bullshit!
[25:06.480 --> 25:07.840]  I think Nick won.
[25:08.280 --> 25:09.320]  I think Nick did it.
[25:10.540 --> 25:11.020]  Incredible.
[25:14.620 --> 25:15.960]  Oh my god.
[25:16.480 --> 25:18.080]  You are the ultimate monkey!
[25:18.880 --> 25:19.820]  Way to go, monkey.
[25:20.300 --> 25:21.120]  Thank you!
[25:21.560 --> 25:23.020]  Alright, you guys want to get right back into it?
[25:23.340 --> 25:24.600]  I was my own worst enemy.
[25:25.120 --> 25:26.060]  That was crazy.
[25:26.720 --> 25:30.180]  Oh, there's a test level as well?
[25:30.280 --> 25:30.880]  That's crazy.
[25:31.180 --> 25:32.140]  Okay, docks it is.
[25:32.480 --> 25:33.620]  Let's go for a swim, boys.
[25:34.620 --> 25:36.000]  Everyone's favorite season of The Wire!
[25:37.040 --> 25:40.580]  Ooh, got a little mix-up here.
[25:40.940 --> 25:43.140]  I'm on one of the three.
[25:45.600 --> 25:46.500]  I was not.
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.480]  Do people not like series season two?
[25:50.020 --> 25:50.340]  No.
[25:50.460 --> 25:51.860]  No, people don't.
[25:52.140 --> 25:52.760]  I didn't find it.
[25:53.440 --> 25:54.680]  I'm on it right now, that's where I'm up to.
[25:55.800 --> 25:57.720]  Jack the skating monkey, five gifted.
[25:58.420 --> 25:58.960]  Appreciate that, Jack.
[25:58.960 --> 26:00.260]  Wait, which season of what?
[26:00.960 --> 26:01.340]  The Wire.
[26:01.520 --> 26:02.180]  Season two of The Wire.
[26:02.180 --> 26:02.500]  Oh, really?
[26:02.900 --> 26:03.520]  Yeah, it's with The Wire.
[26:04.120 --> 26:05.320]  It's the one that's all about the...
[26:06.240 --> 26:08.000]  It's all about that shit down at the docks, right?
[26:08.280 --> 26:08.460]  Yep.
[26:08.640 --> 26:09.000]  It is.
[26:09.960 --> 26:10.420]  Oh, no!
[26:10.920 --> 26:12.360]  Why didn't I catch on to it?
[26:12.620 --> 26:13.440]  Yeah, there's nothing there.
[26:14.160 --> 26:15.840]  Admiral Chops with the gifted deck.
[26:15.840 --> 26:17.340]  Oh, my ass!
[26:20.320 --> 26:21.120]  Alright, that's all.
[26:24.980 --> 26:27.780]  I couldn't quite find the words, but some of it...
[26:27.780 --> 26:28.880]  No, you got me in the end, it's okay.
[26:29.920 --> 26:32.460]  The monkey-crocodile combo, what you got, boys?
[26:37.040 --> 26:38.580]  Croc going all the way.
[26:39.020 --> 26:39.660]  And some.
[26:39.880 --> 26:41.480]  Let's go all the way.
[26:48.560 --> 26:49.900]  Watch where you press A.
[26:50.380 --> 26:52.000]  Man, what a Friday this is.
[26:52.280 --> 26:53.140]  Happy Friday.
[26:54.180 --> 26:56.500]  Big regulation Friday, a lot got done today.
[26:56.560 --> 26:57.140]  It was good stuff.
[26:58.900 --> 26:59.860]  Very productive.
[27:00.140 --> 27:00.260]  Nope.
[27:00.960 --> 27:02.460]  Eat my anus!
[27:02.460 --> 27:03.040]  No, no, no!
[27:04.460 --> 27:05.980]  We hate the lizard.
[27:05.980 --> 27:07.100]  We hate the lizard.
[27:09.420 --> 27:10.700]  Stop the monkey!
[27:13.080 --> 27:14.440]  Indecision has killed the monkey.
[27:15.220 --> 27:15.660]  Twice!
[27:18.760 --> 27:20.960]  Well, Mark said, it sure is a day.
[27:21.100 --> 27:23.920]  Sounds like Mark the Frog is having just as good of a day as we are.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.120]  Mark the Frog is having a time.
[27:25.360 --> 27:26.260]  Oh, I'm not doing umbrella.
[27:26.820 --> 27:28.020]  No dice on the umbrella.
[27:28.860 --> 27:29.800]  Jump high always.
[27:30.940 --> 27:33.000]  Oh, that would have probably been a nice decision.
[27:33.240 --> 27:33.500]  Oh, well.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.420]  He's doing the umbrella, boys.
[27:36.460 --> 27:37.840]  Well, Andrew is loving the umbrella.
[27:38.280 --> 27:38.880]  I was.
[27:39.320 --> 27:40.860]  Yeah, when we had to go down.
[27:41.420 --> 27:41.700]  Right.
[27:45.580 --> 27:46.460]  I suck.
[27:47.260 --> 27:47.420]  Yep.
[27:49.060 --> 27:49.940]  Oh, shit!
[27:52.420 --> 27:52.860]  No!
[27:53.860 --> 27:54.300]  Monkey!
[27:54.540 --> 27:55.160]  Forgetting that.
[27:55.800 --> 27:57.020]  Monkey rides again.
[27:57.240 --> 27:57.520]  How do I?
[27:57.780 --> 27:58.360]  Come on, horse.
[27:58.360 --> 27:59.100]  What are you doing?
[28:00.520 --> 28:04.660]  ArthriticGamer says, this Friday is unfortunately all arthritic, no gamer.
[28:04.920 --> 28:05.180]  That sucks.
[28:05.520 --> 28:06.460]  Oh, man.
[28:09.320 --> 28:11.220]  GuyW2 understands that we hate the lizard.
[28:11.540 --> 28:12.120]  We hate him.
[28:15.670 --> 28:16.570]  Let's do this one.
[28:17.270 --> 28:17.950]  Oh, what is that?
[28:18.050 --> 28:18.210]  Oh.
[28:19.230 --> 28:21.610]  Why do I need the little jump spunk?
[28:24.650 --> 28:26.170]  You spunking and jumping?
[28:27.510 --> 28:29.090]  Or are you jumping then spunking?
[28:30.210 --> 28:31.970]  I think the spunk first.
[28:33.450 --> 28:34.650]  Get some distance.
[28:35.410 --> 28:37.510]  That doesn't happen until season three of The Wire.
[28:38.390 --> 28:41.570]  You get $100,000, but you jizz Flubber.
[28:42.530 --> 28:43.610]  Oh, I'm in.
[28:44.290 --> 28:45.630]  That's totally fine.
[28:47.010 --> 28:48.390]  Oh, horse and chicken.
[28:48.830 --> 28:50.190]  Oh, chicken, what are you doing?
[28:50.930 --> 28:57.170]  Gavin, is it forever like Flubber or does it eventually degrade?
[28:59.350 --> 29:00.890]  Gavin's too locked in to answer your question.
[29:00.890 --> 29:01.110]  Chicken!
[29:02.330 --> 29:03.530]  What was that, Nick?
[29:05.070 --> 29:07.970]  Does it degrade over time or is it forever like Flubber?
[29:08.190 --> 29:09.030]  It's forever Flubber.
[29:09.550 --> 29:10.430]  Oh, man.
[29:13.430 --> 29:17.710]  So if you don't clean your cock up a little bit afterwards, it's going to be bouncing.
[29:18.530 --> 29:21.470]  It's going to be like one of those boxing punch balls in your pants.
[29:24.190 --> 29:25.190]  But it's just forever.
[29:25.270 --> 29:26.970]  It's going to be bouncing everywhere always.
[29:27.170 --> 29:28.270]  You can clean your underwear.
[29:29.450 --> 29:30.250]  That's what you think.
[29:30.390 --> 29:31.030]  I hope you would.
[29:31.550 --> 29:32.110]  I mean, yeah.
[29:33.370 --> 29:34.470]  You can, sure.
[29:35.170 --> 29:36.590]  But then where does it go when you're done?
[29:36.710 --> 29:37.330]  In the washing machine.
[29:37.370 --> 29:37.970]  It's still going to bounce.
[29:38.730 --> 29:39.550]  In the washing...
[29:39.550 --> 29:40.970]  I think Flubber's biodegradable.
[29:41.630 --> 29:42.590]  I don't think it is.
[29:44.990 --> 29:46.350]  Wasn't the problem he couldn't get rid of it?
[29:51.120 --> 29:52.020]  This game is...
[29:53.700 --> 29:54.420]  Come on!
[29:54.860 --> 29:55.620]  Yes, die!
[29:56.040 --> 29:56.900]  Oh, Geoff!
[29:56.980 --> 29:57.740]  That's me, I'm Geoff.
[29:58.460 --> 29:59.480]  Join the party.
[29:59.820 --> 30:00.740]  No, Raccoon!
[30:01.760 --> 30:03.320]  I wanted the trick too bad!
[30:03.560 --> 30:05.040]  I wanted the trick too bad!
[30:07.200 --> 30:08.380]  Oh, he gave it to me.
[30:08.460 --> 30:09.100]  Oh, thank God.
[30:09.680 --> 30:10.740]  Oh, it was only post-mortem.
[30:11.680 --> 30:12.500]  I wanted the trick.
[30:12.560 --> 30:14.580]  I shouldn't have done the trick, but I just had to do it for style.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.040]  You gotta go for style.
[30:17.580 --> 30:18.440]  Gotta go for style.
[30:24.740 --> 30:26.920]  It doesn't tell you what you've already got.
[30:27.860 --> 30:28.960]  Right, just remember what you have.
[30:28.960 --> 30:30.460]  Yeah, I just use my memory to know.
[30:30.860 --> 30:31.260]  Okay.
[30:31.440 --> 30:32.920]  Because it was like five minutes ago.
[30:35.760 --> 30:36.160]  Shit!
[30:36.340 --> 30:37.220]  Oh, where am I?
[30:37.280 --> 30:38.840]  I'm stuck on the...
[30:39.380 --> 30:40.160]  First place!
[30:40.500 --> 30:41.320]  That's the Raccoon.
[30:41.560 --> 30:41.600]  No!
[30:41.740 --> 30:42.820]  Yeah, that's the Raccoon.
[30:43.220 --> 30:43.780]  Die, Lizard!
[30:44.520 --> 30:45.840]  You're such a stupid idiot!
[30:47.680 --> 30:47.960]  No!
[30:48.260 --> 30:49.340]  The horse sucks!
[30:49.660 --> 30:50.840]  The horse sucks!
[30:51.840 --> 30:53.120]  No, the Lizard!
[30:54.040 --> 30:55.340]  What's the point of that?
[31:00.100 --> 31:02.520]  That rail is a rocket if you're on it the wrong way.
[31:03.680 --> 31:05.120]  The rail is always the wrong way.
[31:05.160 --> 31:06.140]  It's pointing straight down.
[31:07.280 --> 31:08.720]  You can't hit it at all upwards?
[31:09.440 --> 31:09.800]  No!
[31:10.460 --> 31:11.520]  The direction is down.
[31:11.620 --> 31:12.460]  Did we just get the same thing?
[31:12.640 --> 31:13.180]  Oh my god.
[31:14.420 --> 31:16.740]  When you said it, it's got a direction that you said it.
[31:17.020 --> 31:18.800]  See the little pointy things on them?
[31:18.860 --> 31:19.200]  The arrows?
[31:20.200 --> 31:20.500]  Yeah.
[31:24.780 --> 31:26.480]  Gavin is sick of your bullshit.
[31:26.760 --> 31:27.020]  Yeah.
[31:33.820 --> 31:34.500]  Yeah!
[31:38.740 --> 31:39.080]  Oh!
[31:39.420 --> 31:40.540]  Okay, okay.
[31:40.980 --> 31:41.400]  Don't sink!
[31:43.700 --> 31:44.720]  Oh god!
[31:49.120 --> 31:52.260]  Dude, that horse just like a dart threw it out.
[31:52.260 --> 31:52.980]  What is going on?
[31:53.180 --> 31:53.920]  What's happening?
[31:53.920 --> 31:54.000]  I'm dead!
[31:57.060 --> 31:58.240]  No, no, I'm here!
[32:00.100 --> 32:01.060]  What happened?
[32:01.180 --> 32:01.900]  Good job, Geoff!
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.200]  It just started sending me everywhere.
[32:06.600 --> 32:08.960]  Admiral Chops, thanks for the five gifted subs.
[32:09.180 --> 32:10.360]  Thank you so much, Chops.
[32:11.040 --> 32:11.420]  Brutal.
[32:11.540 --> 32:12.440]  We're getting everyone subbed.
[32:12.620 --> 32:14.120]  No one's left unsubbed.
[32:16.220 --> 32:17.180]  No unsubbed.
[32:17.840 --> 32:20.620]  We keep this rate up, everybody will be subbed for two years.
[32:21.380 --> 32:23.460]  Gavin's one working bollock subbed.
[32:23.920 --> 32:24.100]  What?
[32:28.600 --> 32:30.160]  Let's make this extra interesting.
[32:30.580 --> 32:31.340]  Oh my god.
[32:31.760 --> 32:32.200]  Crazy.
[32:32.920 --> 32:33.980]  Time it right, fellas!
[32:35.120 --> 32:36.420]  Craig Allman says, are you okay, Gavin?
[32:36.520 --> 32:37.600]  I'm having a mad.
[32:37.700 --> 32:39.800]  This game does not speak to my thumbs.
[32:43.200 --> 32:45.140]  But you like Ultimate Chicken Horse so much.
[32:45.600 --> 32:45.740]  Whoa!
[32:48.300 --> 32:50.180]  I'm just getting bullied by the couch.
[32:51.080 --> 32:51.660]  Come on!
[32:51.820 --> 32:52.780]  No, the gap!
[32:53.420 --> 32:55.360]  I can't see a god dang thing.
[32:55.820 --> 32:57.320]  Why am I going backwards?
[32:58.700 --> 32:59.480]  Oh, look at you go!
[32:59.800 --> 33:00.720]  What's up, dudes?
[33:01.840 --> 33:02.180]  Hey, man.
[33:03.140 --> 33:03.940]  What happened?
[33:04.380 --> 33:04.780]  What happened?
[33:04.780 --> 33:05.100]  Oh god, please stop.
[33:05.440 --> 33:06.700]  Why did I go backwards?
[33:07.400 --> 33:07.800]  No!
[33:08.040 --> 33:08.500]  Damn you!
[33:08.920 --> 33:09.540]  Alright, here we go.
[33:10.000 --> 33:10.700]  Nope, not that way.
[33:11.220 --> 33:11.520]  Here we go.
[33:11.680 --> 33:12.080]  Zap!
[33:14.040 --> 33:15.860]  I banged my head on the stupid plank.
[33:17.100 --> 33:17.680]  Okay, here we go.
[33:19.280 --> 33:20.120]  Okay, here we go.
[33:21.020 --> 33:21.620]  This is it!
[33:21.620 --> 33:22.380]  Yeah!
[33:23.620 --> 33:24.140]  Man.
[33:25.220 --> 33:25.860]  Sick of it.
[33:25.960 --> 33:28.920]  I don't know what launched me backwards.
[33:29.220 --> 33:30.860]  Like, how did the jetpack work that way?
[33:31.360 --> 33:34.040]  Hey, Waxerman, thank you for the five gifted subs.
[33:34.460 --> 33:35.520]  Wallens gave 20.
[33:36.900 --> 33:37.420]  MKNudeStrip.
[33:43.730 --> 33:45.150]  So these stack?
[33:45.670 --> 33:45.850]  Yeah.
[33:46.990 --> 33:47.310]  Nice.
[33:47.650 --> 33:50.990]  But I don't know if they stack in the way you're asking.
[33:51.170 --> 33:53.650]  Does super speed plus super speed equal more super speed?
[33:53.650 --> 33:55.790]  I thought you were doing Don Vito for a second.
[34:01.390 --> 34:03.070]  Come on, come on, come on!
[34:03.130 --> 34:03.510]  Get me that!
[34:03.710 --> 34:03.890]  Why am I falling?
[34:04.210 --> 34:05.430]  Get me that, you idiot!
[34:05.650 --> 34:06.490]  You idiot chicken!
[34:06.910 --> 34:08.370]  You stupid chicken idiot!
[34:10.210 --> 34:10.830]  Come on!
[34:12.810 --> 34:13.550]  Oh, Geoff!
[34:13.830 --> 34:14.050]  Come on!
[34:14.070 --> 34:15.410]  Ah, fuck me, man.
[34:16.210 --> 34:17.090]  I almost made it back.
[34:17.930 --> 34:18.210]  Oh!
[34:18.570 --> 34:18.930]  Oh!
[34:19.210 --> 34:19.950]  Oh, Eric!
[34:20.250 --> 34:20.330]  No!
[34:20.590 --> 34:22.150]  Why am I going down?!
[34:23.650 --> 34:23.690]  Ah!
[34:28.370 --> 34:28.890]  Brutal!
[34:29.630 --> 34:31.230]  Jetpack is maybe not my move.
[34:31.290 --> 34:32.030]  I thought it was.
[34:32.110 --> 34:32.490]  It's not.
[34:32.810 --> 34:36.650]  Jetpack just makes me slowly go down instead of...
[34:38.290 --> 34:39.530]  It's directionally based.
[34:41.790 --> 34:43.090]  What's this little fella do?
[34:45.050 --> 34:46.130]  You can tongue him.
[34:47.050 --> 34:47.270]  Yeah.
[34:49.270 --> 34:49.730]  Okay.
[34:49.730 --> 34:49.850]  Okay.
[34:52.230 --> 34:53.870]  So just nobody's going to get to win?
[34:55.230 --> 34:56.350]  You can make that.
[34:56.790 --> 34:57.690]  I mean, I plan to.
[35:01.980 --> 35:03.340]  I'll eat those words, I'm sure.
[35:05.600 --> 35:06.440]  Put him somewhere.
[35:08.560 --> 35:09.880]  We're almost playing the game.
[35:10.480 --> 35:11.000]  Geoff!
[35:13.600 --> 35:14.520]  Put him somewhere.
[35:14.880 --> 35:15.520]  I'm trying.
[35:16.760 --> 35:17.880]  Oh, that sucks.
[35:18.960 --> 35:19.900]  Yeah, that's not great.
[35:22.480 --> 35:24.040]  I'm in the air!
[35:24.280 --> 35:24.640]  Shit!
[35:26.840 --> 35:27.320]  No!
[35:28.120 --> 35:29.020]  Oh, fuck, I died?
[35:29.140 --> 35:30.540]  I didn't even see me die.
[35:30.920 --> 35:31.240]  Damn.
[35:32.520 --> 35:34.720]  Oh, I fucked up.
[35:36.120 --> 35:38.060]  Oh, what a move by the monkey!
[35:38.260 --> 35:39.820]  Post-mortem, but he did it.
[35:40.560 --> 35:40.920]  Come on!
[35:41.860 --> 35:42.320]  Come on!
[35:43.020 --> 35:43.560]  No, Geoff!
[35:43.780 --> 35:44.620]  No, Geoff!
[35:44.740 --> 35:45.980]  Oh no, the horse!
[35:46.000 --> 35:46.120]  Geoff died!
[35:46.820 --> 35:47.460]  Go, go!
[35:48.300 --> 35:48.740]  I'm floating!
[35:48.840 --> 35:49.380]  Guys, I'm floating!
[35:49.380 --> 35:49.460]  I'm floating!
[35:49.980 --> 35:50.360]  Guys!
[35:51.200 --> 35:51.460]  Come on!
[35:51.640 --> 35:52.520]  Nick is leaving.
[35:52.920 --> 35:53.580]  Come on!
[35:54.520 --> 35:55.120]  Geoff!
[35:57.160 --> 35:58.000]  First place monkey!
[35:58.280 --> 35:59.500]  Oh, second place monkey!
[36:00.960 --> 36:01.560]  Yeah!
[36:03.260 --> 36:03.860]  Incredible.
[36:04.140 --> 36:04.840]  Down and forth.
[36:04.940 --> 36:06.100]  I'm down in the dirt with Gavin.
[36:06.500 --> 36:07.100]  Bronze horse.
[36:07.820 --> 36:08.900]  Chicken in the dirt.
[36:13.760 --> 36:14.360]  Damn.
[36:15.180 --> 36:15.740]  Ooh.
[36:16.380 --> 36:16.980]  Yes.
[36:17.700 --> 36:18.720]  God, this game's really fun.
[36:19.380 --> 36:20.400]  I love it.
[36:22.300 --> 36:24.380]  How do we...
[36:26.720 --> 36:27.160]  Yeah.
[36:29.000 --> 36:29.600]  Yeah?
[36:29.820 --> 36:31.120]  That's gonna be a son of a bitch.
[36:32.060 --> 36:33.140]  Call that a nick.
[36:34.020 --> 36:34.900]  That's a meat...
[36:34.900 --> 36:35.280]  Wait, what?
[36:40.140 --> 36:41.480]  I'm flying, fellas.
[36:42.400 --> 36:42.760]  Whoa.
[36:43.580 --> 36:44.800]  Oh, you couch...
[36:44.800 --> 36:45.280]  What the fuck?
[36:45.620 --> 36:46.640]  What happened?
[36:47.560 --> 36:48.160]  Uh...
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  I just got...
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.740]  Geoff for the win!
[36:52.200 --> 36:53.020]  Geoff for the win!
[36:53.580 --> 36:54.660]  No, Geoff!
[36:55.080 --> 36:55.860]  He did it!
[36:56.240 --> 36:56.640]  Hello!
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.480]  I asked two for Geoff today.
[36:59.500 --> 37:00.540]  Oh, he's not there enough.
[37:00.560 --> 37:00.820]  No!
[37:00.820 --> 37:01.820]  I ain't there yet, though.
[37:02.300 --> 37:03.060]  Oh, shit!
[37:03.060 --> 37:05.160]  Oh, I did the trick, but it wasn't enough.
[37:06.080 --> 37:08.700]  We have to give the bike a strike in the chat.
[37:08.900 --> 37:09.220]  Just asking.
[37:09.360 --> 37:10.660]  So, Gavin's doing a bit, right?
[37:11.020 --> 37:11.360]  Yeah.
[37:11.720 --> 37:11.940]  Yeah.
[37:12.680 --> 37:13.560]  It's a bit.
[37:14.580 --> 37:15.380]  It's a bit.
[37:16.060 --> 37:16.860]  It's gotta be a bit.
[37:17.620 --> 37:17.820]  It's a bit.
[37:17.820 --> 37:18.380]  Oh, that's...
[37:18.380 --> 37:18.780]  Yes.
[37:20.840 --> 37:21.720]  Triple jetpack!
[37:27.250 --> 37:28.090]  Nope, I'm dead.
[37:28.530 --> 37:29.090]  See, there you go.
[37:29.450 --> 37:30.270]  Now you guys can come back.
[37:31.150 --> 37:31.310]  Excellent.
[37:34.410 --> 37:35.290]  Oh, Christ!
[37:35.490 --> 37:35.750]  Wrong way!
[37:36.750 --> 37:37.510]  No, stop!
[37:39.130 --> 37:40.130]  Why can't I...
[37:40.850 --> 37:41.290]  Whoop!
[37:41.690 --> 37:42.390]  Get me through!
[37:42.970 --> 37:43.410]  No!
[37:45.690 --> 37:46.950]  Good job, chicken.
[37:47.550 --> 37:47.710]  No!
[37:47.990 --> 37:48.550]  My bike!
[37:48.550 --> 37:50.050]  Oh, the bike went back!
[37:50.470 --> 37:52.290]  But he's still alive with 30 seconds!
[37:52.490 --> 37:52.750]  Here we go.
[37:53.190 --> 37:54.030]  You got this, Nick.
[37:54.370 --> 37:55.050]  All right, here we go.
[37:55.190 --> 37:56.010]  Okay, Nick, you got it.
[37:56.150 --> 37:56.330]  Okay.
[37:56.690 --> 37:57.270]  All right, Nick, here you go.
[38:01.090 --> 38:02.730]  Turns out I was out of rockets.
[38:03.210 --> 38:03.230]  Game!
[38:04.310 --> 38:05.030]  He did it.
[38:05.390 --> 38:06.470]  And look at that, Gavin!
[38:06.690 --> 38:07.270]  Got some points.
[38:07.390 --> 38:07.710]  Way to go, buddy.
[38:07.710 --> 38:08.330]  Still a dirt chicken.
[38:08.850 --> 38:09.730]  Comeback starts here.
[38:10.170 --> 38:10.490]  There you go.
[38:10.650 --> 38:12.370]  He's punched a fist out of the top of the...
[38:12.370 --> 38:12.790]  Oh.
[38:12.990 --> 38:14.290]  You are the ultimate gator.
[38:14.770 --> 38:15.750]  Let's keep it going, boys.
[38:16.210 --> 38:16.590]  Yeah!
[38:17.190 --> 38:17.830]  Next one.
[38:18.250 --> 38:19.670]  You wanna see what the test map is?
[38:20.230 --> 38:22.170]  Yeah, let's take a look at it.
[38:22.270 --> 38:23.190]  Is this supposed to be it?
[38:23.710 --> 38:24.230]  No idea.
[38:24.250 --> 38:24.770]  I don't know.
[38:24.970 --> 38:26.070]  Oh, you gotta go up and around.
[38:26.430 --> 38:26.910]  Love it.
[38:27.110 --> 38:28.390]  Oh, we'll die for sure.
[38:28.510 --> 38:28.730]  Oh, great.
[38:31.930 --> 38:34.430]  Thanks to the sub, front of the cream line.
[38:35.030 --> 38:35.170]  Hey!
[38:35.750 --> 38:36.370]  Back again.
[38:38.370 --> 38:40.250]  You probably do it facing the other direction, though, chicken.
[38:41.170 --> 38:41.490]  Wait.
[38:41.850 --> 38:42.570]  Where do we start?
[38:42.630 --> 38:43.410]  Do we start up or down?
[38:43.490 --> 38:44.930]  We start left, down, I think.
[38:45.150 --> 38:46.190]  Yeah, we start left.
[38:46.190 --> 38:47.230]  I see, I see, I see.
[38:47.230 --> 38:47.930]  You want it the other way?
[38:48.670 --> 38:50.050]  No, no, I was joking.
[38:52.110 --> 38:53.310]  Dude, never listen to me.
[38:53.370 --> 38:53.690]  I'm stupid.
[38:54.170 --> 38:54.730]  Just gonna...
[38:54.730 --> 38:56.570]  Just to fucking...
[38:56.570 --> 38:57.230]  Where do we start?
[38:57.510 --> 38:57.870]  Left.
[38:58.130 --> 38:58.730]  Alright, cool.
[39:02.080 --> 39:02.740]  Directly left.
[39:06.900 --> 39:08.540]  Well, we've made it to where we can go.
[39:08.700 --> 39:09.540]  All hope was lost.
[39:09.920 --> 39:10.100]  Great.
[39:10.400 --> 39:10.660]  Goodbye.
[39:13.260 --> 39:13.880]  Go ahead, chicken.
[39:14.060 --> 39:14.220]  Check this shit.
[39:14.860 --> 39:15.200]  Okay.
[39:15.660 --> 39:16.980]  Oh, good trick, good trick.
[39:17.660 --> 39:18.320]  Good trick.
[39:18.740 --> 39:19.860]  Check this shit.
[39:20.060 --> 39:20.620]  Good trick.
[39:22.220 --> 39:23.360]  Check this shit.
[39:26.200 --> 39:26.640]  Okay.
[39:28.420 --> 39:29.720]  Probably gonna need to add a little bit.
[39:31.360 --> 39:32.440]  Yeah, get us up there.
[39:34.780 --> 39:36.080]  Is that what you were trying to do?
[39:36.700 --> 39:36.980]  Yeah.
[39:37.920 --> 39:38.360]  Okay.
[39:40.700 --> 39:41.900]  What is the horse doing?
[39:42.440 --> 39:44.060]  Andrew doesn't want us to get up there, I guess.
[39:44.060 --> 39:45.180]  What is anybody doing here?
[39:48.040 --> 39:48.400]  Geoff?
[39:49.320 --> 39:50.480]  Is that how you're gonna go?
[39:50.660 --> 39:50.920]  Okay.
[39:51.040 --> 39:51.760]  What if I do this?
[39:53.360 --> 39:53.920]  Love it.
[39:54.040 --> 39:54.400]  Perfect.
[39:54.580 --> 39:55.000]  That's pretty easy.
[39:55.120 --> 39:55.640]  Yeah, that's great.
[39:55.760 --> 39:56.320]  You nailed it.
[39:56.400 --> 39:57.100]  I love it.
[39:58.000 --> 39:58.840]  That should be bad.
[39:59.480 --> 40:00.460]  Yeah, we can do it.
[40:00.580 --> 40:03.440]  Now all I have to do is hit this rail at the beginning and it shouldn't be a problem.
[40:03.740 --> 40:04.600]  No problem at all.
[40:04.600 --> 40:04.900]  Test level.
[40:05.160 --> 40:05.840]  Step one.
[40:06.120 --> 40:06.380]  Rail.
[40:10.140 --> 40:11.340]  There goes the monkey.
[40:11.760 --> 40:12.320]  Wait, I lived.
[40:14.240 --> 40:16.060]  Chicken all the way.
[40:17.320 --> 40:18.440]  Chicken and the monkey.
[40:18.820 --> 40:19.600]  There goes the monkey.
[40:19.660 --> 40:20.020]  Okay.
[40:21.500 --> 40:22.060]  Yes!
[40:22.980 --> 40:24.340]  The dirt chicken made it.
[40:25.320 --> 40:26.280]  Chicken made it.
[40:26.860 --> 40:28.260]  I love test level.
[40:30.380 --> 40:32.760]  How do I get up there, you son of a bitch?
[40:33.840 --> 40:35.120]  Bike's holding on.
[40:35.860 --> 40:36.260]  Okay.
[40:36.680 --> 40:37.640]  You're doing it.
[40:37.700 --> 40:38.460]  You can do it, Nick.
[40:38.740 --> 40:41.200]  Gavin's floating down into the ether.
[40:42.360 --> 40:42.760]  Ten.
[40:42.860 --> 40:43.600]  Okay, here we go.
[40:43.700 --> 40:44.080]  Nine.
[40:44.080 --> 40:44.560]  He's done it.
[40:44.660 --> 40:45.340]  It's alright, plenty of time.
[40:45.360 --> 40:45.480]  Eight.
[40:45.480 --> 40:45.980]  He's done it.
[40:46.120 --> 40:46.720]  Not enough time.
[40:47.360 --> 40:50.320]  Oh, man.
[40:50.900 --> 40:51.720]  That's so great.
[40:55.570 --> 40:56.470]  That's a chicken of the air.
[40:57.270 --> 40:58.350]  That's so fucking great.
[40:58.970 --> 40:59.810]  Well done, Gavin.
[41:01.150 --> 41:01.550]  Thanks.
[41:03.110 --> 41:03.510]  Okay.
[41:04.630 --> 41:05.990]  I accidentally clicked that.
[41:06.090 --> 41:06.950]  It's just the way you said it.
[41:07.430 --> 41:07.830]  Thanks.
[41:08.370 --> 41:08.930]  Thank you.
[41:09.610 --> 41:10.270]  There you go.
[41:11.050 --> 41:11.350]  There you go.
[41:13.250 --> 41:14.070]  How am I?
[41:14.450 --> 41:15.270]  I've missed it every time.
[41:15.410 --> 41:16.310]  I've missed it every single time.
[41:16.310 --> 41:16.810]  Oh, my God.
[41:16.990 --> 41:17.290]  The frog.
[41:17.650 --> 41:19.270]  The frog killed us both.
[41:19.690 --> 41:20.970]  How do you haunt the frog bear?
[41:22.090 --> 41:23.570]  Go, go, go, go.
[41:24.010 --> 41:25.310]  No, bike, bike.
[41:26.170 --> 41:27.110]  No, bike.
[41:27.270 --> 41:28.170]  Come on now.
[41:29.110 --> 41:29.230]  Trick.
[41:30.110 --> 41:30.570]  Trick.
[41:31.390 --> 41:31.870]  Nice.
[41:31.950 --> 41:32.410]  Good trick.
[41:33.190 --> 41:34.130]  Now trick again.
[41:36.410 --> 41:37.790]  Give me those trick points.
[41:39.230 --> 41:39.510]  Yeah.
[41:40.270 --> 41:40.710]  Wow.
[41:42.390 --> 41:43.690]  He's done me with tricks.
[41:50.270 --> 41:51.150]  Oh, right.
[41:51.330 --> 41:51.930]  Oh, well.
[41:53.230 --> 41:53.670]  Frog.
[41:57.670 --> 41:58.590]  What did I get?
[41:58.630 --> 41:58.970]  What is this?
[41:59.010 --> 41:59.290]  Wind?
[41:59.790 --> 42:00.270]  What is this?
[42:00.950 --> 42:01.970]  Makes it go faster.
[42:02.330 --> 42:03.150]  Oh, it's slippage.
[42:05.190 --> 42:07.090]  I think it just speeds these upsies.
[42:09.530 --> 42:09.970]  Well.
[42:09.970 --> 42:12.130]  I'll see you in hell, buddy.
[42:12.410 --> 42:12.930]  Be careful.
[42:12.930 --> 42:13.590]  Crazy placement.
[42:15.850 --> 42:16.830]  Be careful.
[42:17.330 --> 42:17.970]  Good luck.
[42:18.130 --> 42:18.850]  Good luck.
[42:20.670 --> 42:21.490]  Good luck.
[42:21.770 --> 42:22.230]  Fuck.
[42:23.390 --> 42:23.650]  This frog.
[42:23.650 --> 42:24.490]  Oh, you dog.
[42:24.830 --> 42:25.370]  Okay, here we go.
[42:25.410 --> 42:25.730]  Here we go.
[42:25.790 --> 42:26.230]  Here we go.
[42:27.390 --> 42:27.910]  No.
[42:34.080 --> 42:36.440]  The frog just looks so sad.
[42:38.800 --> 42:42.260]  The frog looked like he let you down and he felt bad about it.
[42:42.320 --> 42:43.800]  Oh, what does fireworks do?
[42:44.600 --> 42:45.600]  Something fun, probably.
[42:45.660 --> 42:46.220]  That's a fan.
[42:47.820 --> 42:48.520]  Let's find out.
[42:48.960 --> 42:51.680]  I can never get on this rail and I don't know why.
[42:51.760 --> 42:53.420]  I don't know why I have such a problem with this rail.
[42:55.060 --> 42:55.420]  I don't know.
[42:56.480 --> 42:57.280]  I'm sorry you do, though.
[42:57.420 --> 42:57.800]  Yeah, I don't.
[42:57.860 --> 42:58.360]  It's crazy.
[43:00.660 --> 43:01.020]  Okay.
[43:01.360 --> 43:03.160]  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I'm doing it wrong.
[43:06.630 --> 43:07.330]  There we go.
[43:08.990 --> 43:10.050]  Oh, God.
[43:10.310 --> 43:11.750]  I've hooked my front wheel.
[43:13.770 --> 43:14.290]  Frog!
[43:14.730 --> 43:15.630]  You prick!
[43:16.210 --> 43:16.390]  Frog!
[43:17.370 --> 43:17.630]  Trick.
[43:18.330 --> 43:18.850]  Trick.
[43:19.570 --> 43:19.650]  Trick.
[43:20.410 --> 43:20.930]  Boom.
[43:21.510 --> 43:22.250]  Ah, shit bags.
[43:22.270 --> 43:22.770]  There you go, frog.
[43:23.410 --> 43:25.870]  Okay, well, upon review, fireworks is not a great placement.
[43:26.050 --> 43:27.210]  For those, they shoot upwards.
[43:29.270 --> 43:30.550]  Who could have guessed?
[43:34.030 --> 43:35.730]  Gavin, it's place-based.
[43:38.750 --> 43:41.150]  Gavin's trying to get as many tricks as he can.
[43:48.420 --> 43:48.820]  Tricks!
[43:50.440 --> 43:51.140]  Oh, good.
[43:51.220 --> 43:51.800]  We hate the lizard.
[43:51.900 --> 43:52.680]  Lizard's at the bottom.
[43:53.120 --> 43:55.200]  I've got my two gold medals.
[43:55.360 --> 43:55.780]  I'm happy.
[43:56.240 --> 43:57.180]  Lizard's in the dirt, baby.
[44:00.120 --> 44:01.180]  Bouncy mine behind you.
[44:01.180 --> 44:02.700]  I should have gone for jump instead of speed.
[44:03.520 --> 44:04.300]  Speed's the devil.
[44:06.040 --> 44:07.000]  That'll be a fun one.
[44:12.520 --> 44:13.880]  What the...
[44:13.880 --> 44:14.260]  There you go!
[44:14.460 --> 44:14.540]  No!
[44:16.780 --> 44:18.680]  That second rail really goes.
[44:19.960 --> 44:20.180]  What?
[44:22.120 --> 44:23.640]  I blew myself up.
[44:25.860 --> 44:29.300]  Nick used the bouncy mine and it bouncy-mined him.
[44:29.620 --> 44:32.300]  I was like, surely this doesn't hurt me.
[44:32.860 --> 44:34.200]  That was awesome.
[44:34.600 --> 44:35.860]  Geoff at the trick point.
[44:38.080 --> 44:39.020]  All right.
[44:39.020 --> 44:42.180]  I was trying to get Geoff and I got myself.
[44:43.140 --> 44:43.840]  Sorry, Geoff.
[44:44.060 --> 44:44.460]  Wait, no.
[44:44.800 --> 44:46.340]  No need to apologize, please.
[44:46.580 --> 44:47.580]  Continue to get yourself.
[44:50.440 --> 44:53.800]  I like the little splash of schmear that ended up on this top ramp.
[44:58.280 --> 44:59.820]  It helps, sort of.
[45:01.080 --> 45:02.700]  Oh, a last resort, Gavin?
[45:03.420 --> 45:04.880]  Yeah, a little life into pieces.
[45:05.480 --> 45:05.840]  I'll pay that.
[45:05.840 --> 45:06.340]  Yeah.
[45:09.420 --> 45:10.960]  All right, fellas.
[45:11.420 --> 45:12.200]  Let's do it, boys.
[45:12.600 --> 45:13.380]  Good luck, everyone.
[45:13.860 --> 45:14.360]  Good luck.
[45:14.820 --> 45:15.360]  Good luck, me.
[45:17.320 --> 45:18.340]  Well, luck me.
[45:19.780 --> 45:20.780]  Why am I going this way?
[45:20.780 --> 45:22.820]  I got absolutely frog reamed.
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.060]  I'm stuck in the ground.
[45:24.840 --> 45:25.320]  No!
[45:25.760 --> 45:26.440]  Get on the bike.
[45:26.580 --> 45:27.160]  Oh, God, the bomb.
[45:27.200 --> 45:27.920]  Is that the raccoon?
[45:28.200 --> 45:30.600]  Is that the raccoon doing a trick?
[45:32.020 --> 45:33.440]  That's what I'm talking about.
[45:34.380 --> 45:35.560]  Nick's tricking it up.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.320]  Oh, no, did I die?
[45:37.540 --> 45:38.460]  Gavin's still alive.
[45:38.660 --> 45:40.100]  Did you post-mortem your way in?
[45:40.800 --> 45:42.300]  Suck butt, bitch.
[45:45.120 --> 45:45.640]  Frickin'.
[45:45.640 --> 45:46.480]  It shifted.
[45:47.300 --> 45:48.180]  It's shifted.
[45:48.900 --> 45:49.840]  Lizard in the dirt.
[45:49.940 --> 45:50.200]  Whoa.
[45:50.460 --> 45:52.580]  Little dirt lizard rolling around in the mud.
[45:53.980 --> 45:56.200]  So much vitriol from you.
[45:56.780 --> 45:57.520]  Eat the lizard.
[46:00.420 --> 46:02.160]  I don't like his beady little eyes.
[46:03.500 --> 46:04.440]  He likes you.
[46:07.680 --> 46:09.720]  Oh, insane TV placement.
[46:09.940 --> 46:10.700]  You suck.
[46:12.160 --> 46:13.000]  A little tricky.
[46:14.480 --> 46:16.580]  I'm going to twat my head on the ceiling now, I think.
[46:18.640 --> 46:19.160]  Ow!
[46:19.300 --> 46:19.500]  What?
[46:25.070 --> 46:25.590]  Shit.
[46:26.590 --> 46:28.390]  Get me there, you dumb raccoon, bitch.
[46:28.390 --> 46:29.150]  That's what I'm talking about.
[46:29.510 --> 46:30.430]  Raccoon all the way.
[46:30.750 --> 46:31.610]  Shit, that was...
[46:31.610 --> 46:32.650]  Whoa, cool.
[46:32.830 --> 46:33.690]  Cool firework.
[46:33.930 --> 46:34.510]  That was insanity down there.
[46:34.950 --> 46:35.690]  Cool firework.
[46:37.050 --> 46:38.610]  It's a stupid horse.
[46:39.330 --> 46:41.370]  Trick, trick, trick.
[46:41.670 --> 46:43.650]  Why do we just float away at the end?
[46:44.090 --> 46:44.690]  I don't know.
[46:45.710 --> 46:47.030]  Wow, look at that.
[46:47.150 --> 46:48.010]  Holding the lead.
[46:48.630 --> 46:49.850]  Wow, the horse.
[46:52.250 --> 46:53.810]  It's the horse's course.
[46:55.070 --> 46:55.730]  Of course.
[46:55.930 --> 46:56.170]  Horse's course.
[46:56.670 --> 46:57.110]  Of course.
[46:57.550 --> 46:59.370]  Horse's of course, of course, of course.
[47:00.430 --> 47:01.470]  I gotta do that.
[47:02.070 --> 47:02.350]  Yeah.
[47:03.830 --> 47:05.050]  Do we all go for double jump?
[47:05.050 --> 47:05.690]  Yeah.
[47:05.690 --> 47:06.130]  Oh yeah.
[47:06.990 --> 47:08.590]  I gotta double, double jump.
[47:10.570 --> 47:11.610]  Holy moly.
[47:12.090 --> 47:12.110]  Town.
[47:12.370 --> 47:12.550]  Oh boy.
[47:12.970 --> 47:13.250]  Oh boy.
[47:13.890 --> 47:14.250]  Oh boy.
[47:16.250 --> 47:16.770]  Ow!
[47:18.070 --> 47:19.790]  That's not me, man.
[47:20.890 --> 47:22.090]  Gavin, you used it.
[47:22.090 --> 47:22.710]  You did it.
[47:23.010 --> 47:23.630]  The raccoon.
[47:24.110 --> 47:24.790]  The raccoon.
[47:25.370 --> 47:26.750]  Yeah, but that was very impressive.
[47:26.750 --> 47:27.510]  That was so awesome.
[47:28.070 --> 47:28.870]  He died.
[47:28.970 --> 47:30.010]  He post-mortem.
[47:30.010 --> 47:30.650]  Post-mortem.
[47:30.790 --> 47:30.810]  Shit.
[47:31.710 --> 47:32.470]  The raccoon.
[47:33.070 --> 47:33.750]  Oh, it gave it to me.
[47:33.750 --> 47:34.530]  No, it didn't.
[47:37.590 --> 47:38.970]  Look at this, boys.
[47:39.510 --> 47:40.810]  We gotta kill the raccoon, fellas.
[47:41.590 --> 47:43.230]  Eric, press 0F4.
[47:45.850 --> 47:47.170]  Three rounds remaining, boys.
[47:49.230 --> 47:50.510]  Oh, it's fireworks.
[47:51.790 --> 47:54.270]  Oh my god, I didn't get anything I wanted.
[47:58.110 --> 47:58.550]  Yeah.
[48:05.850 --> 48:08.150]  Squadsheimer with the...
[48:08.850 --> 48:09.370]  Squadsheimer?
[48:09.630 --> 48:10.990]  That's one of my worms, I think.
[48:12.490 --> 48:13.810]  Thank you so much.
[48:16.870 --> 48:18.070]  Alright, any day now.
[48:18.450 --> 48:18.950]  Here we go.
[48:21.610 --> 48:22.630]  Oh god.
[48:22.750 --> 48:23.610]  Alright, good luck, guys.
[48:23.850 --> 48:24.330]  Squadsheimer.
[48:26.410 --> 48:27.250]  A legend.
[48:27.390 --> 48:27.710]  No!
[48:30.010 --> 48:32.990]  Are you guys familiar with the legend of Squadsheimer?
[48:34.270 --> 48:36.590]  Oh, the full flip from the lizard.
[48:36.770 --> 48:37.810]  And we hate it.
[48:39.010 --> 48:41.170]  No, Andrew.
[48:43.770 --> 48:44.330]  Damn.
[48:45.310 --> 48:46.090]  What's up, buddy?
[48:46.450 --> 48:47.990]  He might have just taken it.
[48:48.090 --> 48:49.410]  Come on, what's the trick point?
[48:50.170 --> 48:50.970]  Give me...
[48:50.970 --> 48:52.290]  Oh, it's right there.
[48:53.170 --> 48:53.470]  Wow.
[48:53.590 --> 48:54.250]  So close.
[48:55.470 --> 48:56.510]  Neck and neck.
[48:57.450 --> 48:58.330]  Here we go.
[48:58.670 --> 48:59.430]  Two rounds remaining.
[49:00.090 --> 49:00.870]  It's getting tight.
[49:02.070 --> 49:03.150]  We're all marbles.
[49:03.850 --> 49:06.590]  Oh, that fan would have come in handy last one.
[49:13.920 --> 49:15.680]  Oh, well that...
[49:16.480 --> 49:17.960]  is a railway to nowhere.
[49:18.660 --> 49:20.780]  We're on a railway to nowhere.
[49:21.580 --> 49:21.960]  No.
[49:22.960 --> 49:24.180]  No, I missed.
[49:24.180 --> 49:25.280]  Shit, shit, shit.
[49:25.300 --> 49:26.580]  Oh, I can't believe it.
[49:27.720 --> 49:28.280]  Unbelievable.
[49:28.700 --> 49:28.900]  Get me there.
[49:29.000 --> 49:29.220]  Wait.
[49:29.460 --> 49:30.020]  Get me there.
[49:30.160 --> 49:30.920]  Gavin, wait.
[49:31.320 --> 49:31.840]  Get me there.
[49:31.840 --> 49:32.320]  Gavin.
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  Gavin, hold on.
[49:35.160 --> 49:37.340]  Oh, I can't believe I fell in between the two platforms.
[49:37.620 --> 49:38.780]  Oh, you want to see something cool, Gavin?
[49:39.020 --> 49:39.560]  Blast yourself.
[49:40.340 --> 49:42.480]  Oh, cool trick.
[49:42.980 --> 49:44.160]  That was pretty cool.
[49:44.460 --> 49:45.180]  That was pretty cool.
[49:45.560 --> 49:46.480]  Gavin, you might take this.
[49:46.740 --> 49:47.740]  Oh my God, Gavin.
[49:47.860 --> 49:48.580]  We want to come from behind.
[49:50.780 --> 49:52.700]  This is crazy.
[49:53.380 --> 49:55.480]  I should have been checking my penis off.
[49:55.520 --> 49:56.800]  You know what this is, guys?
[49:57.380 --> 49:58.000]  What's that?
[49:58.100 --> 49:58.740]  This is a game seven.
[49:59.700 --> 50:00.740]  Game seven.
[50:02.940 --> 50:04.620]  Float softly back to the ground.
[50:05.080 --> 50:05.700]  Yeah, I hate that.
[50:05.960 --> 50:06.560]  I hate it.
[50:06.860 --> 50:07.820]  Triple double jump.
[50:11.660 --> 50:15.740]  All right, I got to remember to use my bit before I...
[50:15.740 --> 50:16.160]  No!
[50:17.580 --> 50:18.760]  What is this?
[50:20.740 --> 50:21.260]  No!
[50:21.340 --> 50:22.220]  My bike!
[50:22.360 --> 50:22.980]  My bike!
[50:23.640 --> 50:24.260]  Oh, the raccoon!
[50:24.920 --> 50:26.100]  What's that got to do with it?
[50:26.260 --> 50:27.760]  What kind of game seven is that?
[50:28.040 --> 50:28.560]  Congratulations.
[50:29.180 --> 50:30.680]  The worst possible result.
[50:30.680 --> 50:31.920]  Like the Lakers.
[50:32.380 --> 50:33.860]  Unstoppable in game seven.
[50:34.200 --> 50:36.040]  Eric takes game seven.
[50:36.300 --> 50:36.600]  Congratulations.
[50:36.600 --> 50:37.640]  What year is that?
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.220]  Oh, the raccoon has done it, boys.
[50:40.360 --> 50:41.660]  He's the ultimate raccoon.
[50:41.800 --> 50:42.900]  Look at how excited he is.
[50:43.060 --> 50:44.100]  The wrong man won.
[50:44.900 --> 50:45.700]  Yeah, I agree.
[50:46.360 --> 50:47.000]  Should we do one more?
[50:48.340 --> 50:50.140]  Take us to 5.01.
[50:51.400 --> 50:54.580]  Hey, we should play that first level again because Andrew didn't play it.
[50:54.920 --> 50:55.740]  Yeah, there you go. Perfect.
[50:56.120 --> 50:57.240]  Oh, and it's a farm?
[50:57.740 --> 50:58.820]  Welcome to the farm, Andrew.
[50:59.180 --> 51:01.060]  Little Ricky B with that win.
[51:01.840 --> 51:03.920]  This is where we're going to retire you to someday, Andrew.
[51:04.220 --> 51:08.460]  As long as I become the glue that holds the rest of you together.
[51:15.150 --> 51:16.490]  Well, not this time.
[51:17.670 --> 51:19.490]  But in the next turn, maybe.
[51:21.030 --> 51:22.370]  You can make it.
[51:22.510 --> 51:23.990]  No, you can't.
[51:24.690 --> 51:26.790]  It's like a stripper pole at a funhouse.
[51:28.530 --> 51:29.890]  Power-up or two, you might make it.
[51:30.330 --> 51:30.730]  Okay.
[51:33.990 --> 51:35.010]  Good luck, fellas.
[51:35.270 --> 51:36.230]  I'll see you in...
[51:36.230 --> 51:39.570]  It was pretty close.
[51:39.750 --> 51:40.850]  It was a lot closer than I thought.
[51:41.810 --> 51:42.430]  Me too.
[51:42.890 --> 51:43.850]  Oh, I love that placement.
[51:48.130 --> 51:49.210]  Alright, monkey and a lizard.
[51:50.050 --> 51:50.350]  What do you got?
[51:50.470 --> 51:51.050]  Extend it.
[51:51.830 --> 51:52.390]  Make it taller.
[51:54.030 --> 51:54.870]  Oh, alright.
[51:57.750 --> 51:58.170]  Nice.
[51:59.830 --> 52:00.630]  That's perfect.
[52:01.650 --> 52:03.050]  Yeah, yeah, perfect.
[52:03.210 --> 52:03.530]  Perfect.
[52:03.650 --> 52:03.970]  That'll work.
[52:04.970 --> 52:06.450]  Alright, let's ride it up.
[52:06.530 --> 52:07.350]  Perfect is the word I'd use, yeah.
[52:16.660 --> 52:17.200]  Nice.
[52:17.200 --> 52:20.020]  I still made it.
[52:20.240 --> 52:20.320]  No.
[52:20.860 --> 52:21.160]  Come on.
[52:21.680 --> 52:21.980]  Yes.
[52:22.160 --> 52:22.480]  Woo.
[52:22.740 --> 52:23.200]  Yes.
[52:23.480 --> 52:24.040]  Good riding.
[52:24.660 --> 52:26.580]  We got points because Gavin sucks.
[52:27.980 --> 52:30.580]  Dumb, duh, chicken nugget bitch.
[52:30.860 --> 52:31.720]  How did we tie?
[52:32.980 --> 52:34.100]  We were both second.
[52:34.180 --> 52:34.820]  That was crazy.
[52:35.280 --> 52:35.740]  Look at that.
[52:35.740 --> 52:37.040]  Look at the tricks, baby.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.040]  Gotta love those tricks.
[52:39.840 --> 52:40.780]  God, this game's fun.
[52:40.920 --> 52:41.460]  Gotta get more tricks.
[52:42.780 --> 52:43.820]  Gavin doesn't like this game.
[52:44.940 --> 52:45.620]  I heard that.
[52:45.620 --> 52:46.380]  I've been hearing that.
[52:46.920 --> 52:47.740]  I see, I see.
[52:47.740 --> 52:48.640]  It puts him in a bad mood.
[52:50.180 --> 52:50.880]  This is the one.
[52:51.300 --> 52:52.760]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[52:54.100 --> 52:54.810]  No, the umbrella.
[52:59.300 --> 52:59.980]  No, no.
[53:00.140 --> 53:02.700]  I landed right between.
[53:02.840 --> 53:03.380]  We're in the crack.
[53:03.840 --> 53:04.980]  You were in the crack.
[53:04.980 --> 53:09.000]  I landed between the end platform and that one right before it.
[53:09.040 --> 53:10.060]  I just went right through.
[53:10.180 --> 53:12.700]  We got points because Eric's a dumb bastard.
[53:14.260 --> 53:15.060]  Don't worry.
[53:15.300 --> 53:15.960]  Don't worry.
[53:16.120 --> 53:17.000]  Nick died too.
[53:17.480 --> 53:18.900]  Nick's also a dumb bastard.
[53:21.440 --> 53:25.140]  So how do you use the umbrella?
[53:26.480 --> 53:27.640]  Isn't it like the A button?
[53:28.080 --> 53:28.760]  It just happens.
[53:28.980 --> 53:30.320]  It just happens when you're in the air.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.420]  You can turn it off for the day.
[53:32.420 --> 53:35.220]  Okay, so I turned it off and died.
[53:35.760 --> 53:37.040]  I didn't know you could turn it off.
[53:37.140 --> 53:38.960]  It just always pops open and I live with it.
[53:40.360 --> 53:42.700]  Mark the frog is a cast iron frog wind chime.
[53:43.040 --> 53:44.380]  That does not surprise me.
[53:45.960 --> 53:46.920]  How's it doing in the rain?
[53:47.140 --> 53:47.320]  Yeah.
[53:48.800 --> 53:50.640]  There's a certain reputation you have to uphold.
[53:51.060 --> 53:52.180]  I suppose so.
[53:52.780 --> 53:53.880]  When you are a duck frog.
[53:53.900 --> 53:54.600]  Oh, Christ.
[53:54.740 --> 53:55.340]  Why won't it?
[53:55.420 --> 53:55.980]  I suck.
[53:56.500 --> 53:56.840]  Come on.
[53:57.560 --> 53:58.600]  Oh, damn it.
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.640]  The umbrella did not launch.
[54:03.000 --> 54:03.480]  Damn.
[54:03.940 --> 54:05.040]  It posts up the butt there.
[54:07.340 --> 54:08.520]  I want to do better.
[54:08.820 --> 54:09.500]  A little baby trick.
[54:09.800 --> 54:10.400]  A little baby trick.
[54:15.940 --> 54:16.420]  Yeah.
[54:20.670 --> 54:22.570]  I've had it too good for too long.
[54:24.890 --> 54:27.810]  Did you say I've had it too good for too long?
[54:27.810 --> 54:28.450]  No, he said we.
[54:29.150 --> 54:31.150]  It really did sound like that's what he said.
[54:31.170 --> 54:32.290]  My name is Poopies and I'll show me.
[54:41.190 --> 54:42.390]  What the fuck?
[54:43.310 --> 54:44.970]  It sucked me down.
[54:49.270 --> 54:50.550]  Post-mortem horse.
[54:50.930 --> 54:52.790]  I don't even know what the fuck happened to that.
[54:53.010 --> 54:54.670]  Knocked the shit out of Andrew.
[54:55.130 --> 54:57.650]  I got launched down by that dumb frog.
[54:58.870 --> 54:59.470]  I followed you.
[54:59.770 --> 55:00.110]  Neck and neck, Andrew.
[55:00.170 --> 55:00.750]  Look at this.
[55:01.090 --> 55:01.850]  The raccoon and the horse.
[55:01.870 --> 55:02.390]  Right in the middle.
[55:03.050 --> 55:05.450]  Nature's enemies joined together.
[55:06.810 --> 55:07.610]  Is that right?
[55:09.330 --> 55:09.890]  Just roll with it.
[55:11.130 --> 55:11.290]  Okay.
[55:12.050 --> 55:13.630]  Did you strangle a horse?
[55:15.070 --> 55:15.670]  Could you?
[55:15.750 --> 55:17.930]  Did you say did you or could you?
[55:18.230 --> 55:21.450]  The neck of a horse I feel like would be too powerful for a human fist.
[55:22.870 --> 55:24.370]  Where the fuck did I go?
[55:24.550 --> 55:25.050]  I lost my-
[55:25.050 --> 55:25.270]  Trick!
[55:25.490 --> 55:25.770]  Yes!
[55:25.970 --> 55:26.150]  No.
[55:26.410 --> 55:26.610]  Yes.
[55:27.670 --> 55:28.630]  Oh, good recovery, Eric.
[55:29.130 --> 55:29.930]  Thank you very much.
[55:30.310 --> 55:31.210]  But you're going to lose again.
[55:31.590 --> 55:32.590]  You're going to get the points.
[55:33.770 --> 55:35.470]  You're going to get the points because you got there first.
[55:35.790 --> 55:37.030]  What is he doing?
[55:38.230 --> 55:39.850]  It's a little tricky chicken.
[55:40.350 --> 55:41.210]  Give me the height.
[55:44.050 --> 55:44.770]  I need the height.
[55:45.530 --> 55:45.950]  Chicky trick.
[55:46.430 --> 55:46.970]  Oh, shit.
[55:47.550 --> 55:48.330]  I gotta get down.
[55:51.770 --> 55:55.290]  Oh, look at that.
[55:55.790 --> 55:57.210]  But how many tricks did he get?
[55:58.110 --> 55:58.750]  Oh, shit.
[56:01.670 --> 56:03.270]  Look at the monkey in the dirt.
[56:04.070 --> 56:05.210]  Look at the monkey in the dirt.
[56:05.770 --> 56:06.670]  Oh, he's dead as dicks.
[56:06.670 --> 56:12.630]  I don't think you could strangle a horse with your hands.
[56:12.810 --> 56:13.510]  I don't think I could.
[56:13.510 --> 56:13.810]  I bet I could.
[56:14.230 --> 56:14.790]  I think I could.
[56:16.010 --> 56:17.670]  Look at the big old neck.
[56:19.170 --> 56:19.410]  Yeah.
[56:19.950 --> 56:20.310]  Yeah.
[56:21.550 --> 56:23.350]  Can you even get your hands fully around it?
[56:23.990 --> 56:25.550]  You have to use your elbow probably.
[56:26.390 --> 56:27.610]  You gotta put them in like a sleeper.
[56:27.670 --> 56:28.410]  Rowdy, rowdy pipers.
[56:28.770 --> 56:28.990]  Oh, okay.
[56:29.370 --> 56:29.510]  Well, yeah.
[56:30.070 --> 56:31.270]  But that's not your bare hands.
[56:31.350 --> 56:32.490]  That's your bare arms.
[56:33.030 --> 56:33.530]  Yeah, it counts.
[56:35.090 --> 56:35.470]  Okay.
[56:36.330 --> 56:36.690]  Semantics.
[56:37.670 --> 56:38.550]  Oh, I suck.
[56:38.750 --> 56:40.210]  Oh, I got popped.
[56:42.850 --> 56:43.210]  No!
[56:44.050 --> 56:44.410]  Idiot!
[56:44.470 --> 56:44.950]  Oh, my God.
[56:44.970 --> 56:45.790]  How do you get around this?
[56:45.910 --> 56:47.470]  Oh, I don't think I can get around that thing.
[56:47.670 --> 56:48.170]  Oh, God.
[56:49.970 --> 56:51.370]  I think Andrew just won.
[56:51.430 --> 56:52.330]  Am I the under horse?
[56:52.550 --> 56:52.850]  No!
[56:53.690 --> 56:54.770]  He's gonna trick to victory.
[56:55.290 --> 56:56.850]  No, I didn't trick at all.
[56:57.290 --> 56:57.750]  Oh, no.
[56:58.650 --> 56:59.670]  Oh, Andrew.
[57:00.750 --> 57:02.670]  All you had to do was one trick.
[57:03.110 --> 57:04.050]  Andrew, you like that?
[57:04.050 --> 57:05.910]  Now I got a little raccoon.
[57:09.670 --> 57:11.050]  Oh, sticky monkey.
[57:11.550 --> 57:12.530]  Oh, sticky monkey.
[57:12.930 --> 57:13.170]  Yeah.
[57:13.390 --> 57:14.950]  Monkey, sticky, sticky monkey.
[57:15.250 --> 57:16.050]  How do we...
[57:18.490 --> 57:20.190]  Do you think this is more helpful here?
[57:20.610 --> 57:20.810]  No.
[57:21.410 --> 57:21.670]  Yeah.
[57:21.910 --> 57:22.370]  You can fall.
[57:22.530 --> 57:22.770]  Yeah.
[57:23.090 --> 57:23.270]  No.
[57:23.470 --> 57:23.750]  No.
[57:23.950 --> 57:24.130]  Yeah.
[57:24.330 --> 57:24.530]  Yeah.
[57:25.650 --> 57:26.050]  Yeah.
[57:26.250 --> 57:27.370]  I don't know what you're doing.
[57:30.250 --> 57:33.190]  What are you like when you're deciding whether or not to take an exit?
[57:36.350 --> 57:36.870]  Uh...
[57:36.870 --> 57:38.270]  I'm more like...
[57:38.270 --> 57:38.650]  No!
[57:39.770 --> 57:40.930]  Where'd the raccoon go?
[57:41.170 --> 57:42.530]  Keep the horse alive!
[57:42.770 --> 57:43.230]  Excuse me.
[57:43.590 --> 57:44.090]  Excuse me.
[57:44.130 --> 57:44.350]  Fuck me.
[57:45.190 --> 57:47.490]  I shot in the air and never came down.
[57:50.190 --> 57:50.250]  Yes!
[57:51.390 --> 57:53.630]  I shot into the air and never came down.
[57:54.690 --> 57:55.890]  I just went to space.
[57:56.190 --> 57:58.290]  I never came down.
[57:59.290 --> 58:00.710]  You flew too close to the sun.
[58:00.990 --> 58:01.250]  I...
[58:01.250 --> 58:01.530]  Yeah.
[58:01.850 --> 58:03.270]  Oh, shit, Icarus.
[58:04.270 --> 58:05.610]  Oh, shit, Icarus.
[58:05.730 --> 58:06.290]  What the fuck?
[58:06.410 --> 58:06.690]  Icarus.
[58:08.490 --> 58:09.150]  Got him.
[58:09.350 --> 58:10.210]  That was crazy.
[58:10.610 --> 58:12.430]  Alright, Gavin, when we get to the end, we gotta put the...
[58:12.430 --> 58:12.750]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:12.790 --> 58:14.050]  Put the fart back.
[58:16.210 --> 58:17.710]  Oh, I can't see where I am!
[58:17.750 --> 58:18.310]  Where am I?
[58:19.150 --> 58:19.510]  No!
[58:20.390 --> 58:21.230]  Son of a...
[58:21.230 --> 58:21.430]  No!
[58:22.130 --> 58:22.790]  You're a horse!
[58:23.530 --> 58:23.890]  No!
[58:24.350 --> 58:25.470]  No idea where I went.
[58:25.810 --> 58:26.730]  I couldn't see.
[58:26.750 --> 58:28.230]  The ultimate horse!
[58:29.010 --> 58:31.410]  Shit, we have to do one more because it's not even 5-0, damn one.
[58:31.470 --> 58:33.850]  It's not even 5-0, we gotta do one more ultimate horse.
[58:33.850 --> 58:34.950]  5-0, damn one.
[58:34.950 --> 58:36.210]  It's the chickies game.
[58:36.810 --> 58:37.470]  This is it.
[58:37.550 --> 58:37.890]  This is it.
[58:37.950 --> 58:38.290]  You guys ready?
[58:38.810 --> 58:39.230]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[58:39.230 --> 58:39.430]  Which one?
[58:39.950 --> 58:40.490]  Let's go Scrapyard.
[58:41.610 --> 58:41.950]  Scrapyard.
[58:41.950 --> 58:42.450]  Scrapyard it is.
[58:42.490 --> 58:43.010]  Let's do it, boys.
[58:44.190 --> 58:45.270]  This will take us all the way.
[58:47.870 --> 58:48.230]  Okay.
[58:48.330 --> 58:48.990]  Alright, who's doing it?
[58:49.970 --> 58:50.670]  I'm doing it.
[58:50.710 --> 58:51.190]  I'm doing it.
[58:56.640 --> 58:57.000]  Well...
[58:58.760 --> 58:59.120]  Well...
[58:59.800 --> 59:00.160]  Okay.
[59:01.400 --> 59:01.760]  Maybe.
[59:02.180 --> 59:02.360]  Alright.
[59:02.860 --> 59:04.980]  Sunny Sleazer says, no, you can end it early.
[59:09.060 --> 59:09.500]  Alright.
[59:10.760 --> 59:11.200]  Oh!
[59:15.360 --> 59:15.800]  Okay.
[59:16.800 --> 59:18.160]  No, the conveyor belt!
[59:18.360 --> 59:18.840]  Oh, I didn't make it.
[59:18.860 --> 59:19.780]  Oh, god damn it.
[59:20.940 --> 59:21.480]  That's tough.
[59:22.080 --> 59:22.460]  That's tough.
[59:22.540 --> 59:22.980]  Brutal.
[59:23.680 --> 59:25.660]  I let you restart from your bike, not your body.
[59:26.300 --> 59:26.480]  Yeah.
[59:28.660 --> 59:29.100]  Sorry.
[59:33.200 --> 59:34.440]  Come on, Geoff.
[59:34.660 --> 59:35.900]  Come on, Mr. Orange Hair.
[59:35.960 --> 59:36.600]  We got this.
[59:38.660 --> 59:39.220]  Decisions.
[59:39.620 --> 59:40.280]  Put down a lunch.
[59:41.180 --> 59:41.740]  Wow.
[59:42.140 --> 59:43.960]  Have yourself a nice little lunch.
[59:44.140 --> 59:47.220]  Have yourself a nice little lunch.
[59:49.160 --> 59:51.480]  Let your stomach get full.
[59:54.560 --> 59:55.920]  I'm asking the real questions.
[59:56.840 --> 59:57.640]  Oh, that didn't work.
[59:57.640 --> 59:58.420]  No, what the fuck?
[59:58.860 --> 59:59.140]  Come on.
[59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.820]  Oh, that's not good for my bike.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.820]  Andrew, I did the exact same thing.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:04.840]  Oh, no.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.760]  We ate the lizard.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.440]  Oh, no.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.800]  No, we ate the lizard.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.160]  Hello, it's me, the lizard.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.600]  No, we hate the lizard so much.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.220]  We ate the lizard.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.340]  Thank you, Regulation Moon Girl.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.360]  Regulation Moon Girl.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:19.700]  Good name.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:20.680]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.120]  Power-ups.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.080]  Power-ups.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.780]  Who let the rats out?
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.460]  Mark the Frog says, everyone remembers Icarus, but remember that Daedalus made it off Crete.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:34.840]  Okay.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.080]  Well, his son didn't listen to him.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.740]  Yeah, tell that to your kid, Nick.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.040]  Yeah, listen to me.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.020]  Son, I'm Daedalus.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.180]  Okay, that was bold.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.180]  That was too bold.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.720]  Oh, good recovery, Gavin.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.040]  Thank you.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.020]  Oh, I died.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.520]  Oh, come on.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.620]  I had it.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.340]  Monkey sliding on his back wheel.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.380]  Oh, wow, what a move.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.380]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:08.640]  Wait, what?
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.780]  What happened?
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.060]  I tried to do a trick and flung myself off.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.480]  Crazy.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:19.800]  But not to a post-mortem.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.080]  Horse and Raccoon in the dirt.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:22.880]  Terrible.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:27.240]  Just seconds away from 5-0-1 and the Dr. Mouse is here.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.340]  The Dr. Mouse.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.820]  Fluffy Jobber.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.440]  Fluffy Jobber.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.440]  Thank you so much.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.540]  Do you know what a Jobber is?
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.400]  Do you know what a Jobby is?
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.320]  5-0-1.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.060]  5-0-1.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.060]  5-0-1.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.660]  5-0-1.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.960]  A Jobby?
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.600]  Yeah, the thing you said.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.300]  The thing you just queued us up for, motherfucker.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.520]  Yeah, but what if I stopped paying attention?
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:00.940]  Now what?
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.160]  It's feces.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:04.960]  Oh, really?
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.800]  Why did I do it twice?
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.100]  What the fuck?
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.320]  Oh, sausages!
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:20.800]  Thanks, chicken.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:22.800]  Thanks, horse.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:24.920]  Raccoon.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:27.600]  Raccoon.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.240]  Oh, look at that.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.740]  Look at the lizard all the way at the top.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:32.920]  Whoa!
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.900]  5-0-1.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:38.920]  Horse in the dirt.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.540]  It's going to be a great weekend, everybody.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:41.980]  It's been a great Friday.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.920]  It's going to be a great Saturday and Sunday.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.720]  Very excited.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.780]  Good luck, fellas.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.660]  You sound like Ben Stein delivering that.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.300]  Zero emotion and very excited.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:57.540]  Greet!
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.920]  I have to stop at a store on the way to Dallas that I don't want to go to.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:08.320]  Oh, my fucking asshole.
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.760]  Why did I do that?
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.760]  Why don't you want to stop at a Nick?
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.860]  Oh, come on!
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:19.320]  I suck.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.620]  What a fucking idiot.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:30.200]  We have a microwave that is under the cabinets that broke and they don't make it anymore.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.880]  So there's one microwave store in Dallas that you got to go to?
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.740]  Yeah, it's in Waxahachie.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.620]  Wait, you're going all that way for a microwave?
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.360]  No, I was on my way.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.160]  I'm just going to stop there.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.060]  I'm just going to Dallas anyway.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.900]  I just don't want to stop in Waxahachie.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.160]  What?
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.160]  Come on, come on, come on.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:52.860]  That's funny shit.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.600]  Okay, thanks, man.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.160]  Where did I go?
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.480]  Where did I go?
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.700]  I fucking sucked.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:58.800]  I'm in the moon.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:03:59.080]  I sucked.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.420]  I fucking sucked.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.820]  I mooned it.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.360]  I hate this game and I hate myself.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.120]  Wait, where am I?
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.080]  Wait, where...
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:05.460]  What?
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:07.740]  Where did I go?
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:09.420]  Idiot!
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.880]  I slipped under Nick.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.400]  The raccoon.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.540]  I'll take a post-mortem.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.120]  Fine with that.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.560]  Oh, idiot.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:22.700]  Fucking idiot.
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.200]  Look at all the monkey tricks.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.600]  Look at all the monkey tricks.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.160]  Worth it.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:28.480]  Oh.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.320]  Oh.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.520]  Anyway, it's the new one, Geoff, that I'm getting.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.560]  It's slightly the wrong size, but they say it should fit the space.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.900]  They say, but they say.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.980]  Yeah, but that's also...
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.540]  The replacement version is also discontinued.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.100]  So this is like one of the only ones left.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:48.880]  Oh, no.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.220]  We have the replacement.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.920]  Can I come over and kick it into the hole?
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.040]  What?
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:56.920]  Yeah.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.120]  You heard it here, folks.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:00.940]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.080]  That's a verbal contract.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:03.820]  Oh, boy.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:04.560]  Better fit.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.080]  Come on!
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:08.140]  Come on!
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:08.660]  I did it again.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.320]  I did it again.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.660]  I suck assholes.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.320]  I hate myself.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.680]  I went out the top of the sky.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:15.800]  I got Eric'd.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.840]  It happens, man.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:19.840]  Oh, God.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:20.160]  Okay.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.320]  Thank you, Elmo Deep Daddy, for the subs.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.460]  I got first, but it was post-mortem, baby.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.860]  I just got deleted off the top of the map.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.020]  That's what happened to me.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:31.500]  It was bullshit.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:32.600]  Rough trade.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.600]  But we've overtaken the lizard.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.000]  What if, Nick, you got a brand new microwave?
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.200]  Uh-huh.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.600]  Well, yeah.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.100]  Go on.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.780]  What's so good about this microwave?
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.380]  It fits the space, and I don't have to demolish it.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.580]  They don't make them this size anymore.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:06:01.180]  It's sort of like, there's only five fridges on Earth that fit the size of the hole in my kitchen kind of thing.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:01.600]  Yeah.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.340]  Yeah.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.740]  Maybe we should stop putting appliances in holes.
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:08.500]  Yeah.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:08.920]  I agree.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.880]  That's a great idea.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.480]  I didn't build the damn thing.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.220]  Starting to sound like Nick built the damn thing.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.420]  Why don't you buy a new hole?
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:16.880]  I'm starting to think.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.940]  Buy a new hole.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.680]  He's got you there.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.260]  Did you consider buying a new hole?
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.340]  I just...
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.860]  I hate him.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.700]  That's okay, I fucking died trying to do a trick.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.520]  I hear the new hole's gonna have 4K.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.860]  Here comes the chicken.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:45.500]  Tell you what, it doesn't fit. You can kick the new one and help me get a new hole.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.040]  That sounded weird. I didn't like that.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.060]  Kick it into Nick's new hole.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.420]  Alright, let's stop saying that.
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.980]  Second place overtaking the chicken as well?
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:55.610]  My goodness.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.420]  In the horse dirt.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:00.280]  Alright.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.080]  Power-ups!
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.060]  Yes!
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:05.800]  Fought back.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.080]  I just want to beat it once.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.260]  I just want to complete this course once.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.560]  Poor Andrew.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.880]  That was me on the last one.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.700]  No!
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.960]  I'm gonna do it!
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.460]  No, I killed myself in the sky!
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.440]  No, that's bullshit!
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.160]  The raccoon post-mortem.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:34.640]  Gavin, get it. There you go.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.260]  There you go.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.920]  Did my wheel come off? What happened?
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.400]  But post-mortem.
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.700]  Full-blown, full-blown, yeah!
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:46.460]  Full-blown, full-blown, yeah.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.680]  Alright, Andrew, you gotta stop the monkey.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.820]  I just want to get there.
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.340]  All I've done is stop myself, so.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.740]  So, baby steps.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.480]  What are you blowing up?
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:03.720]  Geoff?
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:04.360]  What?
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:05.980]  What are you blowing up?
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:06.380]  Nothing.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.220]  You blew up nothing, Geoff.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.160]  Oh, TV at the end!
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.440]  He's gonna have a TV party tonight.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.720]  I'm not gonna make it, so why not put it there?
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:19.200]  It's someone else's problem.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.100]  Oh, you bastard.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.280]  Fuck me.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.060]  Oh, you double bastard.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.260]  Oh no, I got sucked into the bin.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:28.780]  Come on.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:32.700]  Oh, I did it!
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:33.260]  Finally!
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.020]  What?
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.100]  Boys, I hit the wrong button.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:35.840]  Let me live.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.060]  I'm sorry to all my rats out there, I hit the wrong button.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.240]  No, you...
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.640]  How'd you get out of that bin, Gavin?
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.740]  You only won!
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.820]  You did it, buddy.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.800]  I'm on the board with something.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.520]  Well played, Gavin, just dropping that bomb real far back.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.300]  Yeah.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.680]  Ooh.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.540]  Ooh, a coin.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:09.080]  It's totally gettable.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:09.980]  Go get it.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.340]  Well...
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:18.680]  Got it.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.680]  Oh, you absolute...
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:21.980]  Oh no!
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.040]  Come on.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:25.740]  Raccoon!
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.680]  No, the TV!
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.120]  I've just...
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:29.620]  I've regret!
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.700]  Me and the chicken.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.020]  Get in the dirt.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.220]  Oh god, no!
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.280]  I don't think I tricked, though.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.040]  I don't think I tricked.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:45.900]  I think I was too locked in.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.180]  I got a little tricky in.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.680]  Oh boy.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.600]  Is this the last round, too?
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.060]  I think this is the final round.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.360]  Oh, this is for all the marbles, fellas.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:57.740]  Ooh.
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.100]  I gotta get out of here.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:05.600]  Here we go.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:07.560]  Wait a minute.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.660]  No, I can't believe I just fell.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.580]  Oh no!
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.500]  I had it, it was locked in.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:13.800]  Oh no!
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.280]  Oh, Nick, no!
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:16.400]  I had it, won!
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:17.680]  What?
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.440]  What the coin?
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.020]  No!
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:19.900]  No!
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:21.960]  No!
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.120]  The fucking frog!
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.320]  Oh, I bounced!
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.100]  Hell yeah!
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.780]  Oh, I think Nick just...
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:29.660]  Nick, did you just win?
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.040]  No, I just got the coin.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.180]  Oh no, I might be dead!
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.040]  Oh, Andrew with the trick and the coin.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:35.420]  My god.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.280]  That was pretty nice, Andrew.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:37.760]  Give me some points, thank you!
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:39.700]  Yeah, Nick won.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:41.620]  Wow, what a way to go, Nick!
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.040]  Great ending, Nick.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.880]  Way to dig it out, dude.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.400]  That was great.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.540]  Thanks, man, that was fun.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.260]  Dang, Andrew, you came on strong at the end, though, buddy.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.820]  I fell right at the beginning, it was such a heartbreaker.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.060]  Third horse.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.900]  It's the only time I did that.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.860]  Hey, way to go, Ultimate Monkey!
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:54.840]  Yeah!
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.200]  Ultimate Nick!
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.340]  Way to go, boys.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.040]  Way to go!
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.200]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
