[00:00.000 --> 00:06.020]  Welcome everyone. It's Friday. We're back with more Pico Park After Dark.
[00:06.200 --> 00:14.120]  It's hot. It's steamy. It's sensual. La Femme Nikita style silk stockings.
[00:14.440 --> 00:19.000]  Pico Park. We're in the hard park and it's only getting darker.
[00:19.380 --> 00:25.520]  Guys, I'm with Gavin. I'm not done. I'm with Gavin, Geoff, Andrew, and Nick.
[00:25.700 --> 00:27.220]  Guys, how's it going?
[00:27.940 --> 00:29.940]  Robbie Williams is still alive.
[00:30.580 --> 00:36.140]  That's true, but it's simply May, so give it time.
[00:36.340 --> 00:39.980]  You know what this feels like, Eric? It feels like those After Dark Doritos.
[00:41.520 --> 00:45.080]  Oh, those midnight taco style Doritos.
[00:45.380 --> 00:46.800]  Alright, alright, alright.
[00:47.140 --> 00:51.360]  We're ready to go on level four here. Just need a sizable wall of piss rats.
[00:51.560 --> 00:55.020]  Nah, I think we can just do corn cats. The corn cats know that the corn cats are superior.
[00:55.020 --> 00:57.220]  We can just do the corn cats. Look at all the corn cats in there.
[00:57.280 --> 01:00.600]  Chilled Seeker, The Mauler. I'll read out your name if you do the corn cats.
[01:00.660 --> 01:04.540]  There we go. Effortless Gaming. Irving Bunny.
[01:05.280 --> 01:07.220]  Hard pissing. Hard hard pissing.
[01:07.900 --> 01:11.880]  Chilled Wanderer. Alright, Gavin started the game. He doesn't want you to be red.
[01:13.240 --> 01:15.520]  I'm out of here. I don't remember what this was.
[01:16.860 --> 01:17.900]  I don't think we did this, did we?
[01:18.400 --> 01:21.380]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I don't think we did either.
[01:21.980 --> 01:25.860]  We're gonna have to stack here, boys. I can't believe I lived through that.
[01:26.080 --> 01:27.940]  That was chaos. Hop on, boys. Hop on.
[01:31.860 --> 01:36.720]  Okay, so, yeah, I don't know. Who gives a shit? Who fucking cares?
[01:38.580 --> 01:40.560]  Who fucking cares? I'll make the jump.
[01:40.680 --> 01:42.580]  Alright, you can do it. I believe in you. Blue, get closer.
[01:45.060 --> 01:47.120]  You got it, you got it. Keep it rocking, keep it rocking.
[01:47.120 --> 01:48.500]  I am going two. What does that mean?
[01:50.900 --> 01:52.240]  So you stopped?
[01:52.860 --> 01:56.580]  I think it means there have to be two people on that.
[01:57.120 --> 01:57.760]  Oh, maybe.
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.280]  I don't know. What, to keep it from falling, you think?
[02:02.860 --> 02:05.240]  I just don't even, like, that was incredible.
[02:05.760 --> 02:08.240]  On my screen, you were just way in there, buddy.
[02:08.360 --> 02:10.480]  No, my screen as well. Alright, red, anytime.
[02:11.520 --> 02:12.740]  Well, blue's helping. Andrew?
[02:13.880 --> 02:16.560]  Jesus Christ. No, you're not good. I'm great.
[02:16.560 --> 02:17.520]  Alright, here we go.
[02:18.700 --> 02:19.940]  Let's try round two.
[02:21.740 --> 02:22.720]  Stop on the two.
[02:23.860 --> 02:24.400]  And then what?
[02:25.020 --> 02:26.140]  Purple, get off.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.720]  Why do you keep stopping on the two?
[02:29.540 --> 02:31.260]  Because I think, is that what it is?
[02:32.160 --> 02:35.140]  I thought it was two people have to stand on it so it doesn't fall.
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.680]  No, I think it's, well, it didn't happen the first time. I don't know why it would happen the second time.
[02:39.840 --> 02:43.240]  I think it's just so we have time to jump over that other block. It's just a bit of freedom.
[02:43.240 --> 02:45.660]  So it's like two seconds before it pops.
[02:45.860 --> 02:46.240]  Alright, you ready?
[02:46.740 --> 02:47.540]  I'm good.
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.680]  Alright, I'll just jump off as soon as we get close enough.
[02:54.580 --> 02:57.560]  And then we could restack on three.
[02:58.240 --> 02:58.480]  Yeah.
[02:59.580 --> 03:00.580]  Let's try a restack.
[03:01.140 --> 03:01.840]  We can do it.
[03:03.180 --> 03:04.300]  I'm used to this. I'll go to the back.
[03:05.420 --> 03:06.040]  Andrew's good.
[03:06.800 --> 03:08.840]  I'm good. Andrew's real good on this one.
[03:08.920 --> 03:09.680]  I'm locked in.
[03:09.680 --> 03:11.140]  Alright, everyone ready?
[03:11.700 --> 03:11.900]  Yeah.
[03:12.440 --> 03:14.920]  So everyone above green I think is going to have to go over.
[03:15.020 --> 03:17.180]  Me and Gavin are going to have to go under and we're going to have to restack.
[03:17.640 --> 03:18.000]  Restack.
[03:18.680 --> 03:18.940]  Sorry.
[03:21.300 --> 03:23.660]  Should we stop there so you guys can go over?
[03:24.620 --> 03:26.080]  You want me to stop on two then stop on three?
[03:27.500 --> 03:29.780]  Yeah, I think it's stop on two then we boogie.
[03:30.080 --> 03:30.980]  And then stop on three.
[03:31.380 --> 03:34.160]  So everyone above Gavin is going to have to go and stack.
[03:35.400 --> 03:36.660]  Or wait up there and go.
[03:36.660 --> 03:37.160]  Okay, you ready?
[03:37.940 --> 03:40.120]  I guess restack on top of me.
[03:41.420 --> 03:42.940]  Cause I'll wait on the platform.
[03:43.060 --> 03:43.260]  Right here.
[03:44.600 --> 03:45.240]  I gotta go.
[03:46.060 --> 03:46.820]  Get up.
[03:48.180 --> 03:49.340]  It was close.
[03:49.640 --> 03:52.160]  We just have to be a little bit faster.
[03:52.700 --> 03:53.260]  It's hard.
[03:54.600 --> 03:56.760]  I'll try not to. I'll just stay on the green.
[03:57.020 --> 03:57.900]  You did great.
[03:58.380 --> 04:00.360]  We just have to figure out the timing.
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.180]  Okay, so it's going to be me, Geoff, and Nick are going to go.
[04:07.020 --> 04:07.780]  We good?
[04:08.200 --> 04:09.880]  Oh, you're good buddy.
[04:10.940 --> 04:11.800]  Alright, here we go.
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.580]  I'm going to land first.
[04:13.840 --> 04:14.940]  Gotta go, gotta go.
[04:21.960 --> 04:23.160]  I got it this time.
[04:24.740 --> 04:26.300]  I think if we
[04:26.300 --> 04:27.960]  wait up there for just an extra second
[04:27.960 --> 04:29.760]  it'll give them time to get to the three.
[04:29.900 --> 04:30.540]  I got a problem with that.
[04:31.060 --> 04:32.700]  So Gavin, me, and Nick.
[04:32.700 --> 04:34.320]  I think I hate this game.
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.040]  Here we go.
[04:35.200 --> 04:37.720]  I think I've always hated this game.
[04:39.400 --> 04:40.280]  Go.
[04:42.600 --> 04:43.660]  Oh yeah.
[04:46.960 --> 04:48.200]  Oh yeah.
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.360]  Oh yeah.
[04:53.880 --> 04:55.320]  Oh yeah.
[04:58.420 --> 05:00.180]  Fuck you.
[05:01.140 --> 05:02.020]  Fuck you.
[05:02.020 --> 05:02.240]  Oh.
[05:04.760 --> 05:05.680]  I'm losing it.
[05:05.880 --> 05:06.980]  It's so early as well.
[05:07.320 --> 05:12.180]  We're in the fucking dark world.
[05:12.440 --> 05:12.920]  We're in the fucking
[05:12.920 --> 05:14.820]  the nether or whatever.
[05:15.720 --> 05:16.100]  Here we go.
[05:16.800 --> 05:18.100]  We don't have time for losing it.
[05:19.500 --> 05:21.040]  Gavin, you fucking...
[05:21.040 --> 05:23.440]  What did I do? You landed under me.
[05:23.880 --> 05:25.140]  I landed under you.
[05:25.280 --> 05:26.360]  How would I have done that?
[05:28.340 --> 05:28.840]  I don't know.
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.600]  Nobody knows. I have to check the footage.
[05:32.620 --> 05:34.820]  Alright, so me and Geoff are gonna go
[05:34.820 --> 05:36.540]  straight across. You guys all go.
[05:36.780 --> 05:37.700]  Ready? Nick, you ready?
[05:38.820 --> 05:41.360]  And then are we restacking on everyone else?
[05:41.620 --> 05:41.820]  Yeah.
[05:44.760 --> 05:45.640]  Hop on.
[05:46.320 --> 05:46.520]  Go.
[05:49.380 --> 05:50.900]  That was so close.
[05:51.140 --> 05:52.080]  That was pretty close.
[05:53.480 --> 05:54.900]  And then somebody's gonna have to hit that button
[05:54.900 --> 05:56.840]  super fast. Yeah, whoever's on the top
[05:56.840 --> 05:58.260]  of the stack is gonna have to really go.
[06:00.240 --> 06:00.760]  I think Nick
[06:00.760 --> 06:02.480]  on the top should really have been working, so let's keep it going.
[06:02.960 --> 06:04.420]  Nick likes it to be on the top.
[06:04.680 --> 06:06.560]  Here we go. Milf style, baby. Let's go.
[06:07.400 --> 06:07.560]  What?
[06:12.140 --> 06:12.500]  Nice!
[06:13.840 --> 06:14.200]  Geoff!
[06:14.560 --> 06:14.940]  Hit the button!
[06:16.940 --> 06:17.300]  No!
[06:18.540 --> 06:19.460]  We did it!
[06:20.960 --> 06:22.560]  Holy shit! Good job, guys!
[06:22.960 --> 06:24.180]  I've actually blown away.
[06:24.400 --> 06:26.000]  That was awesome. That was incredible.
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.980]  Geoff, MVP in that one. Way to go, Geoff.
[06:28.520 --> 06:29.380]  Geoff, that was incredible.
[06:30.860 --> 06:31.280]  Way to go.
[06:31.480 --> 06:33.860]  Milf style, baby. Milf style!
[06:35.440 --> 06:36.240]  Milf style, baby.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.460]  Nick, that was for you, my friend.
[06:38.960 --> 06:39.640]  Hey, thanks, man.
[06:41.200 --> 06:42.160]  Shout out to the Milfs out there.
[06:42.700 --> 06:43.800]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[06:44.720 --> 06:45.640]  Watch out for the spikes.
[06:46.340 --> 06:47.340]  Haven't we done this before?
[06:47.520 --> 06:47.900]  Maybe.
[06:49.280 --> 06:50.700]  This looks oddly familiar.
[06:52.400 --> 06:53.440]  I think we've done this before.
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.080]  Oh, okay.
[06:55.620 --> 06:57.920]  I'm gonna go. I'm gonna try to run off!
[06:58.640 --> 06:58.920]  Okay.
[06:59.120 --> 07:00.940]  I mean, Andrew, that's so not on you.
[07:00.980 --> 07:01.800]  I don't even know what to say.
[07:02.080 --> 07:05.420]  Maybe there's one person in the back who just comes off the back.
[07:05.860 --> 07:06.120]  Yeah.
[07:06.900 --> 07:08.700]  So you go all the way forward again.
[07:09.900 --> 07:10.660]  Geoff, you wanna do it?
[07:11.780 --> 07:14.040]  Oh, that's so difficult.
[07:14.340 --> 07:15.620]  It's so fast.
[07:16.260 --> 07:17.560]  I think it has to be the person
[07:17.560 --> 07:18.760]  on the front jumping off.
[07:20.000 --> 07:20.880]  Dude, I don't know.
[07:21.800 --> 07:23.320]  I think both...
[07:23.320 --> 07:25.860]  I assume you have to jump off either side of it.
[07:26.120 --> 07:26.480]  Yeah, I agree.
[07:26.480 --> 07:28.680]  It's a really good stack, but I think you'll bang your head.
[07:29.320 --> 07:29.640]  Hey, Geoff.
[07:31.600 --> 07:33.940]  So what was your plan?
[07:34.840 --> 07:35.480]  I made it.
[07:36.040 --> 07:36.480]  Nick made it.
[07:36.540 --> 07:38.580]  You were just standing on me.
[07:39.120 --> 07:39.420]  Just thinking.
[07:39.880 --> 07:41.660]  Can I go on the other side?
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.500]  I'll try and stand on the back.
[07:44.100 --> 07:44.460]  Ready?
[07:45.580 --> 07:47.380]  You get in position.
[07:48.540 --> 07:49.960]  We don't have to time the getting on.
[07:50.100 --> 07:50.680]  We just have to...
[07:50.680 --> 07:52.240]  I'm gonna get on and then jump off.
[07:53.880 --> 07:54.740]  Like some of that.
[07:55.340 --> 07:56.380]  So you do have to time it a little.
[07:56.580 --> 07:57.080]  There we go.
[07:58.520 --> 07:58.840]  Wow.
[08:00.600 --> 08:02.520]  Hold on, don't...
[08:02.840 --> 08:03.700]  Oh, Jesus.
[08:05.580 --> 08:06.220]  God, no.
[08:06.420 --> 08:07.720]  We all have to do... how?
[08:08.140 --> 08:08.920]  It's not possible.
[08:09.340 --> 08:13.260]  Can we just do little jumps and have it...
[08:14.320 --> 08:15.360]  Do you think it's a...
[08:17.340 --> 08:18.520]  Floppy disk repair, man.
[08:18.580 --> 08:20.140]  Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[08:21.380 --> 08:22.440]  Thank you so much.
[08:22.560 --> 08:22.960]  Shit.
[08:23.560 --> 08:23.800]  Sorry.
[08:25.940 --> 08:28.140]  Isn't that like a secret speakeasy in Austin?
[08:28.300 --> 08:29.460]  The floppy disk repair shop?
[08:29.620 --> 08:31.580]  Yeah, I think it's connected to handlebar.
[08:32.100 --> 08:33.460]  I don't know if that place is still...
[08:33.460 --> 08:34.020]  Oh, perfect.
[08:35.300 --> 08:36.000]  I'll be the back.
[08:36.320 --> 08:39.020]  What does the countdown do?
[08:39.320 --> 08:39.840]  I'll be the front.
[08:40.520 --> 08:40.980]  Alright, ready?
[08:40.980 --> 08:41.700]  Yeah.
[08:43.840 --> 08:44.720]  Do you...
[08:44.720 --> 08:45.340]  Eric...
[08:45.340 --> 08:47.860]  Can you step on that and see if it does anything?
[08:48.160 --> 08:49.260]  It moves the platform to my right.
[08:50.060 --> 08:51.980]  Geoff, you gotta go to the right.
[08:52.640 --> 08:53.660]  I'm trying, man.
[08:55.880 --> 08:56.660]  It's hard.
[09:03.780 --> 09:06.200]  Surely there's like a stack technique somewhere.
[09:06.360 --> 09:06.880]  I don't think so.
[09:07.440 --> 09:09.120]  I don't know how the top person
[09:09.120 --> 09:09.820]  wouldn't get their head bumped.
[09:10.200 --> 09:11.380]  Here's what I think has to happen.
[09:11.580 --> 09:14.940]  I think I have to jump on this back and Geoff has to be the one to control it.
[09:16.280 --> 09:17.300]  Like, he has to control
[09:17.300 --> 09:18.920]  when we get... yeah, like that.
[09:19.120 --> 09:19.820]  I think that's what it is.
[09:20.100 --> 09:22.200]  The back person doesn't have to jump off because it becomes one.
[09:22.780 --> 09:22.940]  Yep.
[09:24.400 --> 09:25.940]  There we go.
[09:26.360 --> 09:26.880]  That's all it is.
[09:27.660 --> 09:28.460]  Good job, Eric.
[09:28.760 --> 09:29.080]  Sorry.
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.200]  Anyone want to go on the other side, Nick?
[09:34.740 --> 09:36.500]  Now it becomes a problem. How do we get up?
[09:37.120 --> 09:38.140]  I think you have to stack.
[09:39.280 --> 09:39.620]  Wait.
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.660]  Here, Nick, you get off.
[09:44.440 --> 09:46.540]  No, no, no.
[09:46.640 --> 09:47.560]  Go off on the other side.
[09:49.200 --> 09:50.300]  And then I'll go over here.
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.260]  And then you come up
[09:52.260 --> 09:53.580]  and we'll try to time it together.
[09:53.860 --> 09:54.760]  How am I gonna come up?
[09:55.680 --> 09:55.820]  Okay.
[09:57.680 --> 10:00.280]  So, I think maybe...
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.600]  I need to jump on your head?
[10:02.060 --> 10:03.260]  Yeah, but you have to get up to do that.
[10:04.100 --> 10:05.700]  Oh, why are we...
[10:05.700 --> 10:05.900]  Ah!
[10:07.740 --> 10:09.420]  That's my fault. I got excited.
[10:09.840 --> 10:10.420]  I got excited.
[10:10.440 --> 10:12.240]  I'm like, oh, we're ready to go.
[10:12.680 --> 10:15.240]  In my head, I'm like, we already did this part.
[10:15.660 --> 10:16.580]  Sorry, that's on me.
[10:16.960 --> 10:18.060]  I apologize.
[10:19.000 --> 10:19.660]  Yeah, I know.
[10:20.880 --> 10:24.420]  That was the least Eric play I've seen.
[10:25.240 --> 10:25.720]  Absolutely.
[10:25.720 --> 10:27.800]  My head just went somewhere else suddenly
[10:27.800 --> 10:29.600]  and all of a sudden
[10:29.600 --> 10:31.260]  it was like, why did I do that?
[10:32.260 --> 10:33.280]  I couldn't tell you
[10:33.280 --> 10:33.920]  why I did that.
[10:34.200 --> 10:34.760]  No idea.
[10:36.820 --> 10:37.180]  Okay.
[10:38.480 --> 10:40.240]  I don't know what to do here.
[10:41.300 --> 10:42.540]  I would like to play
[10:43.440 --> 10:45.240]  moments like that for you.
[10:45.480 --> 10:46.360]  Oh, we're so close.
[10:46.940 --> 10:47.740]  That was like it.
[10:48.640 --> 10:49.620]  Yeah, that was like it.
[10:50.860 --> 10:52.020]  You know what you can do?
[10:52.280 --> 10:54.280]  Here, I got an idea. Let's do that again.
[10:54.340 --> 10:55.320]  Let's get in the same position, Nick.
[10:56.680 --> 10:57.740]  You wanna do it right now?
[10:57.740 --> 10:58.860]  Let's do it at the end.
[10:59.320 --> 11:04.020]  We got the first three on lock.
[11:04.340 --> 11:05.720]  Like, I feel like we're so good
[11:05.720 --> 11:06.240]  at this now.
[11:08.680 --> 11:09.380]  Ah, sorry.
[11:09.900 --> 11:11.660]  No, it's alright. It's tough.
[11:11.720 --> 11:13.020]  I kinda wish you hadn't said that, Eric.
[11:15.080 --> 11:16.060]  Nah, we got this on lock, baby.
[11:16.060 --> 11:17.120]  45 minutes later.
[11:20.970 --> 11:21.530]  There we go.
[11:21.810 --> 11:22.210]  Nice.
[11:23.390 --> 11:25.570]  I can feel the nervous energy of Gavin.
[11:27.610 --> 11:28.610]  Just like Twitch.
[11:31.410 --> 11:32.250]  Yeah, we're locked in.
[11:32.310 --> 11:33.570]  We just gotta get the...
[11:34.450 --> 11:35.470]  Well, that was weird.
[11:35.470 --> 11:36.170]  How did that happen?
[11:37.210 --> 11:37.830]  Locked in, huh?
[11:39.330 --> 11:41.730]  In my defense, I think your head
[11:41.730 --> 11:43.470]  was preventing the platform from racing.
[11:43.850 --> 11:45.510]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. In Andrew's defense,
[11:45.610 --> 11:46.430]  that was your fault, dude.
[11:47.350 --> 11:49.710]  Listen, I was on the platform, but
[11:50.410 --> 11:52.130]  it threw me that it didn't go up
[11:52.130 --> 11:52.990]  when there were two of us on it.
[11:52.990 --> 11:53.590]  Gavin, that was cool.
[11:53.630 --> 11:54.810]  That was awesome.
[11:55.350 --> 11:55.750]  Physics!
[11:57.390 --> 11:57.790]  Sorry.
[11:57.910 --> 11:58.310]  Sorry.
[12:03.810 --> 12:04.630]  That was all me.
[12:04.870 --> 12:04.970]  Think it's bad code?
[12:06.090 --> 12:07.290]  No, that was just bad.
[12:07.530 --> 12:08.990]  That was bad code. By me.
[12:12.430 --> 12:14.270]  I can recognize some bad code when I see it.
[12:14.410 --> 12:15.870]  It'll look like some bad code.
[12:16.930 --> 12:18.030]  Just gonna go back this way.
[12:23.150 --> 12:23.510]  Nice.
[12:24.770 --> 12:26.570]  The earlier the person on the right jumps,
[12:26.710 --> 12:27.930]  the safer the person on the left is.
[12:28.930 --> 12:29.290]  Yep.
[12:30.150 --> 12:30.510]  Okay.
[12:32.870 --> 12:33.690]  Andrew, come over.
[12:34.830 --> 12:36.530]  Nick, you're gonna what?
[12:36.630 --> 12:38.890]  I'm gonna count down, I'm gonna do the 3, 2, 1, go,
[12:39.050 --> 12:40.870]  and then on go, you jump up, and I'll jump
[12:40.870 --> 12:41.470]  and go on your head.
[12:43.710 --> 12:44.510]  Let's try it.
[12:44.830 --> 12:45.350]  I love it.
[12:46.290 --> 12:48.610]  Nick doesn't sound confident.
[12:50.110 --> 12:51.310]  See, that's...
[12:51.310 --> 12:52.230]  Oh, when you jumped, it stopped.
[12:53.230 --> 12:54.590]  Because it's only one person.
[12:54.730 --> 12:55.290]  Okay, here we go.
[12:56.790 --> 12:57.370]  Thanks, Seb.
[13:00.990 --> 13:01.790]  That's it!
[13:02.650 --> 13:04.510]  So then the person on the top can jump,
[13:04.590 --> 13:06.190]  and then on the way down, the other person can jump.
[13:07.070 --> 13:07.270]  Yeah.
[13:07.890 --> 13:08.790]  We gotta figure it out.
[13:09.470 --> 13:10.070]  Excuse me.
[13:12.150 --> 13:12.550]  Ow.
[13:16.620 --> 13:17.440]  Ay-ay-ay.
[13:21.840 --> 13:23.300]  I don't know what happened there.
[13:23.340 --> 13:23.960]  I should be dead.
[13:24.040 --> 13:24.520]  I don't either.
[13:24.920 --> 13:26.540]  Oh, really? On mine, you weren't even close.
[13:27.980 --> 13:28.860]  That was my bad.
[13:31.060 --> 13:32.180]  Thanks, Shiny Addy.
[13:32.260 --> 13:33.100]  Thank you for the subscription.
[13:33.480 --> 13:34.260]  Thank you so much.
[13:36.320 --> 13:37.040]  Oh, shit.
[13:37.540 --> 13:40.280]  No, we're just out of order, so it threw me.
[13:41.060 --> 13:41.680]  Sorry, I got scared.
[13:41.840 --> 13:42.480]  I'm getting scared here.
[13:43.620 --> 13:43.960]  Nice.
[13:46.700 --> 13:48.520]  Geoff jumping the gun, I like it.
[13:48.960 --> 13:49.800]  Just in a hurry.
[13:50.620 --> 13:51.380]  Get past this.
[13:52.960 --> 13:54.160]  Somebody in the chat said,
[13:54.220 --> 13:56.560]  why isn't Eric going last if he's the man with the plan?
[13:56.680 --> 13:57.680]  I have no plan for this.
[13:57.900 --> 13:59.440]  I don't know how to beat this part.
[14:00.820 --> 14:02.760]  I just know how to get up to the top here.
[14:02.840 --> 14:05.140]  I don't know how to beat the part where it's the last two people.
[14:05.240 --> 14:06.020]  I have no idea.
[14:07.040 --> 14:07.580]  We're close.
[14:15.540 --> 14:16.080]  Good try.
[14:16.080 --> 14:16.460]  Woof.
[14:18.780 --> 14:19.300]  Woof.
[14:21.260 --> 14:22.040]  Somebody said,
[14:22.140 --> 14:24.180]  Eva rules and Shaheen is playing a dangerous game.
[14:26.480 --> 14:27.460]  Talking Survivor?
[14:27.720 --> 14:29.480]  That's true, they're talking Survivor.
[14:31.600 --> 14:33.260]  It's been so much fun watching him play.
[14:33.440 --> 14:34.400]  He's done such a great job.
[14:34.840 --> 14:35.460]  He's been awesome.
[14:38.440 --> 14:38.960]  Nice.
[14:40.960 --> 14:42.200]  There you go.
[14:42.200 --> 14:43.360]  There you go.
[14:43.380 --> 14:44.900]  I pressed the button for Teddy Blork.
[14:44.980 --> 14:47.160]  I did it. Now what, Teddy?
[14:48.420 --> 14:49.940]  Just stay down for a second, Nick.
[14:50.300 --> 14:52.360]  I feel like you can avoid
[14:52.360 --> 14:53.800]  the spike almost.
[14:54.580 --> 14:55.520]  It's close, right?
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.280]  Oh, wow.
[14:58.720 --> 15:00.420]  So you're saying really get close.
[15:00.420 --> 15:02.040]  If you really hug that edge,
[15:02.120 --> 15:04.040]  then maybe we can go all the way up and it's not a problem.
[15:04.100 --> 15:04.940]  Let's give it a shot.
[15:07.220 --> 15:07.620]  Booyah.
[15:07.780 --> 15:08.700]  Wait, wait, wait.
[15:09.740 --> 15:10.960]  Okay, okay, okay.
[15:11.140 --> 15:12.600]  This is a very small platform.
[15:12.860 --> 15:14.340]  So I think what we have to do,
[15:14.700 --> 15:16.160]  I'm going to press it and run
[15:16.160 --> 15:17.380]  and jump to the end.
[15:17.720 --> 15:20.840]  Should we do a thing where I go first and use your head
[15:20.840 --> 15:22.320]  to jump across and then Nick goes
[15:22.320 --> 15:23.800]  and then Gavin and then Geoff and then you run?
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.960]  Dude, you really trust that we're like...
[15:26.960 --> 15:28.800]  Okay, I can try to get it across.
[15:29.100 --> 15:30.200]  Okay, you want to do that? Go for it.
[15:31.340 --> 15:33.260]  One more person on top of me, probably.
[15:34.580 --> 15:36.740]  Does it start with the button
[15:36.740 --> 15:38.460]  or when we land on it? It's the button.
[15:38.860 --> 15:40.500]  Alright, so just everyone except Eric
[15:40.500 --> 15:42.600]  get on that thing. That's what I'm saying.
[15:43.360 --> 15:44.140]  Yeah, I got it.
[15:44.300 --> 15:45.080]  I understand.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.980]  I don't think we need a double stack
[15:48.980 --> 15:50.220]  but just the idea was to
[15:50.740 --> 15:51.700]  use Eric. I don't know.
[15:52.780 --> 15:54.160]  What's the confusion at this point?
[15:54.340 --> 15:56.660]  I don't know. Move to the right, Geoff.
[15:57.400 --> 15:57.900]  There we go.
[15:59.240 --> 16:00.560]  Alright, everyone duck.
[16:02.680 --> 16:03.080]  Ooh.
[16:04.200 --> 16:05.400]  Oh, that's so fast.
[16:06.300 --> 16:07.360]  Go, go, go, go, go!
[16:08.460 --> 16:10.120]  Oh, it doesn't move!
[16:10.320 --> 16:11.000]  We don't go with it!
[16:11.760 --> 16:13.540]  Yeah, there's nothing you can do about that.
[16:13.600 --> 16:14.100]  That's tough.
[16:14.300 --> 16:15.640]  At least we know.
[16:19.780 --> 16:20.580]  What a...
[16:21.540 --> 16:21.940]  prick.
[16:22.920 --> 16:24.320]  What a prick of a level, huh?
[16:25.120 --> 16:26.700]  If you're too close to the platform
[16:26.700 --> 16:27.360]  it doesn't raise.
[16:29.280 --> 16:30.680]  So Geoff was accidentally
[16:30.680 --> 16:31.540]  holding it with his hat.
[16:31.820 --> 16:33.720]  You were just throwing me for a loop the whole time.
[16:33.920 --> 16:36.140]  You said I'm holding it with my hat? There's no way.
[16:36.760 --> 16:37.460]  No, no.
[16:37.600 --> 16:39.600]  Gavin was on your head.
[16:41.160 --> 16:41.960]  Oh, okay.
[16:42.900 --> 16:44.740]  Holding it with your hat?
[16:44.960 --> 16:46.440]  Well, I thought it was like a thing where it got stuck
[16:46.440 --> 16:48.160]  because we were preventing platforms
[16:48.160 --> 16:48.980]  from going up earlier.
[16:49.220 --> 16:51.460]  With his head? Yeah.
[16:51.780 --> 16:53.860]  He was sucking on your toes so you couldn't go anywhere.
[16:55.440 --> 16:56.400]  Ah, sorry about that.
[16:57.260 --> 16:59.260]  It was my fault, I think.
[16:59.660 --> 17:05.100]  If the back person dies, it's always the front person's fault.
[17:05.880 --> 17:06.360]  Ready?
[17:08.440 --> 17:08.920]  Okay.
[17:10.840 --> 17:12.880]  That was almost on cue.
[17:14.320 --> 17:14.800]  Ready?
[17:15.220 --> 17:17.400]  No, I'm accepting the fault for that. That was my fault.
[17:18.220 --> 17:19.700]  Well, that was not my fault.
[17:19.820 --> 17:20.420]  That was Gavin.
[17:20.620 --> 17:21.400]  That was Gavin.
[17:27.860 --> 17:28.380]  Okay.
[17:31.280 --> 17:32.520]  Oh, you know what?
[17:32.980 --> 17:34.060]  Oh, I didn't...
[17:34.060 --> 17:36.300]  That was an accident.
[17:36.480 --> 17:38.240]  I didn't even mean to be on the platform for you.
[17:43.480 --> 17:45.620]  You got me scared now.
[17:45.900 --> 17:47.580]  I won't kill you.
[17:49.680 --> 17:50.240]  Stop.
[17:52.780 --> 17:53.340]  Gavin!
[17:53.920 --> 17:55.060]  That's not really a jump.
[17:55.060 --> 17:56.160]  See, exactly, look.
[17:56.260 --> 17:57.680]  I'm trying to...
[17:57.680 --> 18:00.500]  I jump off before the back person gets crushed,
[18:00.600 --> 18:02.340]  but Geoff rides it real high.
[18:16.740 --> 18:18.440]  I'll platform this motherfucker.
[18:18.620 --> 18:19.760]  What a load of bullshit.
[18:20.560 --> 18:21.220]  That was awesome.
[18:21.860 --> 18:22.680]  You guys want to start moving right?
[18:22.680 --> 18:24.140]  That was climage.
[18:24.480 --> 18:26.100]  Oh, you pressed the button there a little bit.
[18:26.500 --> 18:26.960]  Did you see that?
[18:27.600 --> 18:28.740]  It says five.
[18:30.260 --> 18:31.500]  Are you sure?
[18:32.740 --> 18:34.300]  Am I sure? Yes.
[18:34.660 --> 18:35.220]  It didn't move.
[18:37.140 --> 18:37.620]  Anyway...
[18:37.620 --> 18:39.760]  We need the triple stack when we get over there.
[18:40.260 --> 18:40.340]  Fast!
[18:41.440 --> 18:42.500]  Ready? Hang on.
[18:42.900 --> 18:44.240]  And remember, bottom moves with it.
[18:45.860 --> 18:47.060]  Go, go, go.
[18:48.160 --> 18:50.800]  Someone stopped running.
[18:51.440 --> 18:52.280]  Who was that?
[18:52.960 --> 18:53.400]  It was me.
[18:53.520 --> 18:56.160]  I didn't mean to stop, I just fell in front of you.
[18:57.460 --> 18:58.300]  And then died.
[18:59.180 --> 18:59.940]  For my hubris.
[19:00.640 --> 19:00.960]  Nice.
[19:02.160 --> 19:03.700]  Oh, I love when these two are paired.
[19:04.380 --> 19:04.760]  Yeah!
[19:10.700 --> 19:12.040]  So good every time.
[19:12.900 --> 19:14.480]  Well, I got yelled at for moving.
[19:14.860 --> 19:15.920]  You're doing great.
[19:16.380 --> 19:17.620]  I'm not yelling at anyone.
[19:17.620 --> 19:18.820]  Nobody's yelling at anybody.
[19:23.220 --> 19:24.720]  It's just fun to see the breakdown.
[19:25.860 --> 19:27.040]  There's something with you two.
[19:27.140 --> 19:28.340]  The timing's off right now.
[19:39.620 --> 19:40.340]  I'm scared.
[19:41.080 --> 19:41.680]  There we go.
[19:42.100 --> 19:43.440]  You can feel the real nervous energy.
[19:48.660 --> 19:49.300]  Nice.
[19:57.270 --> 19:59.210]  Wow, what a team!
[19:59.250 --> 19:59.450]  So good.
[20:00.290 --> 20:01.610]  I'm teasing it, man.
[20:03.330 --> 20:04.490]  I'm going to stay put.
[20:05.170 --> 20:06.630]  And then no one stands still.
[20:07.170 --> 20:10.430]  So just Eric and Andrew.
[20:11.530 --> 20:12.170]  That's it.
[20:12.830 --> 20:13.830]  Oh, shit!
[20:14.970 --> 20:15.750]  Someone stopped.
[20:16.290 --> 20:18.390]  Andrew and Geoff were in front of me.
[20:19.330 --> 20:21.270]  And I got killed.
[20:21.670 --> 20:22.970]  Nick, did you say I did?
[20:24.170 --> 20:24.650]  Did you?
[20:24.810 --> 20:26.210]  I was on someone's head, you fool.
[20:27.050 --> 20:27.930]  I was on your head.
[20:28.750 --> 20:31.290]  I was on a head. It doesn't matter.
[20:32.810 --> 20:33.930]  Whatever Nick is saying
[20:33.930 --> 20:35.370]  fucked me up so bad, I ran back
[20:35.370 --> 20:36.090]  off the platform.
[20:38.510 --> 20:38.870]  Sorry.
[20:39.970 --> 20:40.710]  No, it's okay.
[20:47.380 --> 20:48.100]  There you go, boys.
[20:50.360 --> 20:51.080]  Such textbookness.
[20:51.300 --> 20:51.440]  Ready?
[20:51.440 --> 20:53.780]  So now, orange and red
[20:53.780 --> 20:55.140]  just run your little dicks off.
[20:55.420 --> 20:56.920]  And green.
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.700]  Yeah, I got it. Well, I'm going to jump on the top.
[20:59.900 --> 20:59.960]  Okay.
[21:02.140 --> 21:02.540]  Someone...
[21:03.900 --> 21:06.360]  Geoff, you gotta go, dude!
[21:06.380 --> 21:07.720]  I went...
[21:07.720 --> 21:09.680]  Geoff went and then turned around
[21:09.680 --> 21:11.860]  and palmed everyone else and I went flying.
[21:12.580 --> 21:13.260]  I got...
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.120]  I got excited.
[21:14.760 --> 21:16.920]  That last death, that one's on me.
[21:16.980 --> 21:18.960]  I got too excited and started just pressing the jump button.
[21:18.960 --> 21:20.740]  That's on me. 100%.
[21:24.500 --> 21:25.160]  Ooh.
[21:26.160 --> 21:27.060]  Oh, shit.
[21:28.020 --> 21:29.800]  I'm freaking out now.
[21:30.360 --> 21:32.960]  I love this pairing.
[21:33.440 --> 21:34.220]  My favorite.
[21:34.480 --> 21:35.620]  I don't like this game.
[21:39.460 --> 21:40.640]  Alright, I'm back.
[21:41.020 --> 21:42.480]  I blacked out there for a second.
[21:44.980 --> 21:46.620]  The zero trust
[21:46.620 --> 21:48.540]  between these two is just phenomenal.
[21:48.820 --> 21:49.960]  It's so good.
[21:50.360 --> 21:52.460]  There's just no trust between them
[21:52.460 --> 21:55.060]  and they just both keep hopping off. It's so funny.
[21:55.480 --> 21:56.280]  I don't trust them.
[21:56.960 --> 21:57.380]  Yep.
[21:58.380 --> 21:59.880]  These two though...
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.680]  You guys are nuts.
[22:01.880 --> 22:03.860]  You guys are so fucking good at that, it's wild.
[22:04.360 --> 22:06.060]  You guys are dialed in.
[22:07.140 --> 22:08.760]  Alright, no one stop.
[22:09.200 --> 22:10.400]  Only blue,
[22:10.800 --> 22:11.940]  red, and green walk.
[22:12.540 --> 22:14.660]  I gotta jump on the top to get the key, guys.
[22:14.660 --> 22:15.040]  That's true.
[22:15.680 --> 22:16.860]  Shut this out.
[22:17.600 --> 22:19.180]  You stopped in front of me!
[22:20.880 --> 22:22.160]  I'm trying to walk
[22:22.160 --> 22:23.260]  because I have the key.
[22:23.580 --> 22:26.260]  I'm running to the front because I have the key.
[22:26.860 --> 22:27.580]  Shut up.
[22:27.740 --> 22:29.900]  It is pushing me off the edge and I'm stopping you.
[22:30.200 --> 22:30.960]  That was on me.
[22:31.500 --> 22:33.420]  That was on me.
[22:34.120 --> 22:34.880]  You were right.
[22:35.040 --> 22:37.640]  Gavin gave up on the run and that's why we died.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.400]  I was holding right the whole time.
[22:42.400 --> 22:44.220]  On my screen, you stopped moving
[22:44.220 --> 22:46.800]  to yell at Eric about that he cut you off.
[22:46.800 --> 22:48.220]  No, I stopped because I couldn't run
[22:48.220 --> 22:50.440]  forwards anymore because there was someone in front of me.
[22:59.660 --> 23:02.140]  How is it so hard to hold right?
[23:05.560 --> 23:07.340]  It's almost a really good question.
[23:08.100 --> 23:08.840]  Here we go.
[23:14.410 --> 23:15.450]  Not Geoff!
[23:18.590 --> 23:19.770]  Don't be so sure about that.
[23:24.290 --> 23:25.330]  Oh, no!
[23:25.430 --> 23:25.970]  Come back!
[23:28.950 --> 23:29.470]  Moron!
[23:30.970 --> 23:32.010]  You dipshit!
[23:32.610 --> 23:33.810]  I thought it goes.
[23:33.990 --> 23:34.570]  Wasn't it going?
[23:35.310 --> 23:36.310]  It's going to come back!
[23:37.570 --> 23:38.830]  Anyone got a rope?
[23:39.990 --> 23:41.250]  Idiot flag for Gavin.
[23:42.010 --> 23:42.910]  Let him fly.
[23:43.130 --> 23:43.530]  Go ahead.
[23:43.530 --> 23:45.630]  Anyone got...
[23:45.630 --> 23:47.550]  Anyone got a grappling hook?
[23:51.530 --> 23:53.690]  I was very
[23:53.690 --> 23:55.150]  bewildered that I saw the numbers
[23:55.150 --> 23:56.270]  counting down already.
[24:03.440 --> 24:04.600]  Nice.
[24:07.420 --> 24:08.440]  Sorry about that.
[24:11.220 --> 24:11.800]  Okay.
[24:11.800 --> 24:12.340]  Jeez.
[24:18.010 --> 24:18.930]  Oh, that was me.
[24:19.050 --> 24:21.150]  That was me.
[24:22.490 --> 24:23.150]  It's okay.
[24:24.690 --> 24:25.650]  We're a loud one.
[24:26.970 --> 24:28.310]  After the button incident.
[24:29.430 --> 24:29.990]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[24:30.710 --> 24:31.070]  Jump over.
[24:31.930 --> 24:32.630]  I don't want you to.
[24:34.670 --> 24:35.150]  Nice!
[24:37.990 --> 24:39.750]  Ah, you bloody tricked me back!
[24:41.670 --> 24:42.450]  Try again.
[24:42.450 --> 24:42.850]  Why did you...
[24:43.650 --> 24:46.050]  Why did you put your hands into my face?
[24:55.170 --> 24:56.690]  Yeah! Good job, fellas!
[24:56.830 --> 24:57.350]  You know.
[24:59.410 --> 25:00.190]  Oh, God.
[25:00.770 --> 25:01.630]  Oh, fuck.
[25:09.240 --> 25:10.180]  Very good.
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.620]  Alright, while I have you here,
[25:12.700 --> 25:14.720]  May 11th, we'll be doing an anniversary stream
[25:14.720 --> 25:16.440]  right here on Twitch TV, so
[25:16.440 --> 25:18.820]  check it out. May 11th, 11am.
[25:18.820 --> 25:21.520]  Be here. Anniversary regulation podcast.
[25:22.040 --> 25:22.880]  Happy Mother's Day.
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.540]  Happy Mother's Day.
[25:24.860 --> 25:26.820]  You think they'll make a Twitch TV like Chive TV?
[25:26.820 --> 25:28.320]  Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me.
[25:28.420 --> 25:30.560]  Get off me. I'm off. I'm off. I'm off. I'm off.
[25:35.430 --> 25:36.390]  Oh, fuck me.
[25:36.530 --> 25:37.470]  Keep moving right. Keep moving right.
[25:37.510 --> 25:38.750]  Keep going. Keep going.
[25:39.050 --> 25:41.130]  Oh, shit!
[25:41.430 --> 25:42.070]  Good job, everybody!
[25:44.410 --> 25:45.490]  Barely 25 minutes
[25:45.490 --> 25:46.610]  to clear that first level.
[25:47.150 --> 25:47.470]  Simple.
[25:49.570 --> 25:50.010]  Alright.
[25:50.150 --> 25:50.450]  Easy.
[25:51.650 --> 25:53.790]  Somebody says, why not at 11.11?
[25:56.630 --> 25:57.730]  Alright, stream's cancelled.
[25:57.830 --> 25:58.670]  You're banned.
[25:59.370 --> 26:01.250]  Oh, we gotta make ourselves little, but it makes
[26:01.250 --> 26:01.950]  one of us big?
[26:03.090 --> 26:05.110]  I think the longer you stay, the smaller you get.
[26:05.330 --> 26:07.230]  Oh, you don't wanna die small.
[26:08.070 --> 26:08.350]  Oh.
[26:08.990 --> 26:10.070]  Yeah, tell me about it.
[26:12.790 --> 26:13.230]  What?
[26:14.230 --> 26:15.010]  Yeah, I don't know.
[26:15.010 --> 26:16.730]  You don't wanna be too small when you die.
[26:16.970 --> 26:18.270]  Be a tiny little guy.
[26:22.590 --> 26:22.990]  So...
[26:22.990 --> 26:24.090]  Holy shit.
[26:26.470 --> 26:26.870]  So,
[26:26.990 --> 26:28.870]  I think it's just we gotta...
[26:28.870 --> 26:30.790]  Oh, you can jump pretty far like that, huh?
[26:31.070 --> 26:32.730]  Oh my god. This is horrible.
[26:33.310 --> 26:34.470]  Alright, let's just catch up.
[26:35.510 --> 26:35.990]  Try again.
[26:36.890 --> 26:39.070]  So, do we have to get to the other side and then stack
[26:39.070 --> 26:39.470]  for the key?
[26:40.690 --> 26:41.090]  Probably.
[26:41.090 --> 26:41.630]  Probably.
[26:42.790 --> 26:45.090]  Make yourself as big as...
[26:47.790 --> 26:48.310]  Geoff.
[26:49.350 --> 26:50.730]  He became tiny.
[26:51.050 --> 26:51.990]  So fucking tiny.
[26:53.450 --> 26:54.850]  Like, insane.
[26:55.530 --> 26:56.370]  Oh, I got the right size.
[26:56.850 --> 26:57.710]  Try again.
[26:58.090 --> 26:59.130]  Did you die of smallness?
[26:59.490 --> 27:00.570]  I died of smallness.
[27:01.290 --> 27:02.530]  It was too small.
[27:06.310 --> 27:07.950]  Andrew, you got real small again.
[27:07.950 --> 27:09.430]  I'm a tiny little small guy.
[27:14.650 --> 27:16.150]  Aw, that sucks.
[27:16.210 --> 27:16.630]  You suck.
[27:18.530 --> 27:21.270]  No, that's fair on that one.
[27:21.490 --> 27:22.950]  It sucks. You suck.
[27:24.090 --> 27:24.890]  Oh shit.
[27:25.870 --> 27:26.750]  I'm overcooked.
[27:29.090 --> 27:30.430]  There we go.
[27:33.090 --> 27:34.050]  Holy shit.
[27:34.590 --> 27:35.870]  Why did we do it that way?
[27:35.970 --> 27:36.930]  Why did I go there?
[27:36.930 --> 27:38.630]  I don't know. Wait on Andrew.
[27:38.890 --> 27:39.870]  There you go.
[27:40.110 --> 27:42.850]  Jesus fucking Christ. Try again.
[27:46.890 --> 27:48.650]  Just keep standing right on the edge.
[27:48.770 --> 27:49.490]  I was just taking my time.
[27:50.290 --> 27:51.170]  Try again.
[27:52.050 --> 27:53.770]  Stop taking your fucking time.
[27:53.890 --> 27:54.710]  No, I'm taking my time.
[27:55.330 --> 27:57.470]  Me taking my time didn't make you miss that jump.
[27:58.330 --> 27:58.690]  That was you.
[28:00.410 --> 28:01.990]  Aw, damn. No time.
[28:02.790 --> 28:04.130]  If only I took my time.
[28:07.570 --> 28:09.070]  Oh my god.
[28:11.730 --> 28:13.210]  Have we done two levels today?
[28:14.210 --> 28:15.730]  Yeah, I think so.
[28:15.790 --> 28:16.930]  I think we've done two so far.
[28:17.410 --> 28:18.890]  That's pretty good for the dot pop.
[28:18.910 --> 28:19.930]  Fuck me.
[28:20.750 --> 28:21.710]  You should take in your time.
[28:23.050 --> 28:25.510]  Gduff, big subscription. Thank you.
[28:25.630 --> 28:26.770]  Thank you so much, Gduff.
[28:31.200 --> 28:33.700]  Am I small enough? Aw, man.
[28:34.960 --> 28:35.920]  How did you...
[28:35.920 --> 28:37.940]  Look, I'm just that good.
[28:39.240 --> 28:40.480]  Take your fucking time, I guess.
[28:40.540 --> 28:40.940]  Oh, god.
[28:42.780 --> 28:43.900]  Come on, take your fucking time.
[28:44.000 --> 28:44.920]  Alright, is that enough for the keef?
[28:45.820 --> 28:48.740]  I don't know. Nick's going insane, so I guess we'll find out.
[28:49.340 --> 28:49.680]  What do you mean?
[28:51.240 --> 28:52.200]  Oh my god.
[28:52.540 --> 28:53.940]  Okay, we need to stack...
[28:53.940 --> 28:54.960]  Oh my god, Andrew.
[28:56.160 --> 28:57.240]  I don't know why he left.
[28:57.800 --> 28:59.340]  One of us needs to be a little big, right?
[28:59.900 --> 29:02.180]  We can get bigger if we need to, but I think this is enough.
[29:02.800 --> 29:03.860]  No, no, it's gotta be one more.
[29:05.520 --> 29:06.340]  There you go.
[29:06.340 --> 29:07.120]  There it is.
[29:08.880 --> 29:09.840]  Stop, stop, stop!
[29:11.300 --> 29:12.480]  Andrew's a delicate baby.
[29:12.920 --> 29:14.640]  I'm a tiny little baby, I can't be smaller.
[29:15.460 --> 29:17.320]  If he goes down anymore, we'll die.
[29:17.320 --> 29:17.600]  I'm a tiny little delicate baby.
[29:17.880 --> 29:18.960]  You can get bigger, though.
[29:19.600 --> 29:21.020]  Yeah, but I want to see what's ahead first.
[29:21.720 --> 29:23.700]  Just waiting on Geoff.
[29:25.900 --> 29:26.540]  I see.
[29:27.360 --> 29:28.080]  Should I get bigger?
[29:28.240 --> 29:31.740]  Yeah, we probably need a little bit big.
[29:32.420 --> 29:33.840]  Do you want to do it, or do you want me to?
[29:33.840 --> 29:34.920]  You gotta get too big.
[29:35.700 --> 29:36.520]  I'll do it.
[29:36.640 --> 29:36.880]  Okay.
[29:39.480 --> 29:40.720]  And then, uh, get on me?
[29:44.940 --> 29:45.720]  Someone get under me?
[29:47.740 --> 29:48.240]  That's it?
[29:49.020 --> 29:49.500]  That's it?
[29:49.700 --> 29:51.100]  Now we only need to get big.
[29:52.160 --> 29:53.020]  Yeah, but not too big!
[29:53.320 --> 29:54.800]  Don't die, don't die, you'll die!
[29:57.440 --> 29:58.140]  You'll die, you'll die, you'll die.
[29:58.140 --> 29:59.940]  Why don't you guys jump on me?
[30:02.880 --> 30:03.600]  You went...
[30:03.600 --> 30:05.340]  What the fuck?
[30:05.720 --> 30:06.900]  Are you gonna fit in the corridor?
[30:07.140 --> 30:10.040]  I'm too small to...
[30:11.220 --> 30:12.020]  One, two...
[30:14.260 --> 30:15.040]  I'm too tiny.
[30:16.240 --> 30:17.280]  Why won't you grow, Andrew?
[30:18.740 --> 30:20.700]  Go get big, Andrew, then I'll go get big.
[30:22.300 --> 30:23.140]  Careful, dude.
[30:23.540 --> 30:26.600]  Don't get too big, because I'm just about the right size.
[30:26.600 --> 30:27.260]  Do I need to be bigger?
[30:27.960 --> 30:29.880]  No, me and you need to jump on Nick.
[30:30.800 --> 30:31.000]  Okay.
[30:31.980 --> 30:33.780]  Alright, Nick, can you get on the other side of me?
[30:34.040 --> 30:35.140]  Nick, you should jump over there.
[30:35.580 --> 30:36.040]  There you go.
[30:36.180 --> 30:37.720]  And then, Andrew, can you jump on me?
[30:39.500 --> 30:41.580]  Fuck, I'm a little bit too small to jump on.
[30:41.580 --> 30:42.900]  Get a little bigger, get a little big.
[30:44.660 --> 30:45.360]  Yeah, there you go.
[30:45.880 --> 30:47.380]  Alright, now, Andrew, go.
[30:47.560 --> 30:48.020]  Uh-oh.
[30:49.120 --> 30:50.600]  I gotta shrink, or you go big.
[30:51.900 --> 30:52.560]  You can do it.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.220]  Okay, I need to shrink.
[30:56.160 --> 30:56.720]  How the fuck?
[30:58.420 --> 30:59.100]  I need shrink.
[30:59.100 --> 31:00.940]  Maybe go small a little.
[31:00.940 --> 31:01.300]  Or you shrink.
[31:01.540 --> 31:04.040]  How do you think you're not increasing your jump?
[31:04.040 --> 31:06.420]  I don't think it affects your ability to jump.
[31:06.780 --> 31:08.860]  Well, it affects the platform.
[31:10.820 --> 31:12.420]  I can't get past you to get shrunk.
[31:13.740 --> 31:15.120]  I know, Andrew's on me.
[31:16.140 --> 31:18.240]  Well, what?
[31:18.980 --> 31:21.380]  We're gonna need them to come down, because we can't.
[31:21.480 --> 31:23.560]  Everyone's gonna have to watch Eric get small.
[31:25.900 --> 31:27.060]  I'm not jumping here.
[31:27.060 --> 31:28.140]  You're gonna have to sprint.
[31:28.620 --> 31:29.980]  You're gonna have to run across it.
[31:30.380 --> 31:33.300]  Andrew needs to run at me so I can jump over him.
[31:34.820 --> 31:35.700]  Like that?
[31:36.180 --> 31:36.660]  Alright, sprint.
[31:38.180 --> 31:39.860]  I didn't think you'd make it.
[31:41.460 --> 31:42.480]  It's not at you.
[31:42.780 --> 31:43.900]  It's just the situation.
[31:44.460 --> 31:44.900]  Ridiculous.
[31:48.080 --> 31:50.280]  Okay, this is right there.
[31:51.700 --> 31:52.480]  Geoff, can you jump up?
[31:53.120 --> 31:53.560]  Yeah.
[31:54.740 --> 31:55.400]  Not quite.
[31:55.560 --> 31:55.840]  Okay, clear, Geoff.
[31:56.100 --> 31:58.240]  I can jump.
[31:58.980 --> 32:01.040]  But I can go from green, get back down.
[32:01.440 --> 32:01.800]  There we go.
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.220]  Do you think it's not quite enough?
[32:06.300 --> 32:08.060]  I could've jumped on green.
[32:08.820 --> 32:09.400]  Okay, cool, here.
[32:11.880 --> 32:12.640]  That was weird.
[32:12.940 --> 32:14.120]  You didn't jump on green.
[32:15.140 --> 32:16.020]  So anyway, I'm stuck.
[32:16.320 --> 32:17.980]  I absolutely just jumped on green.
[32:18.500 --> 32:20.040]  No, you jumped over green.
[32:20.040 --> 32:21.240]  No, I didn't jump over green.
[32:21.580 --> 32:24.460]  Dude, on my screen, you totally cleared me.
[32:24.640 --> 32:25.240]  Get the fuck down.
[32:25.320 --> 32:26.940]  Didn't even get close.
[32:27.940 --> 32:28.780]  Purple, get out of the way.
[32:29.640 --> 32:30.900]  What do you want me to do?
[32:31.040 --> 32:31.660]  Get out of the way.
[32:34.320 --> 32:34.940]  Can't be done.
[32:36.000 --> 32:36.420]  Can't be done.
[32:36.780 --> 32:37.580]  Green, get over there.
[32:39.900 --> 32:41.980]  Just a slight smidge.
[32:42.300 --> 32:45.300]  No, I think we need someone who's tall to get up there.
[32:45.360 --> 32:45.860]  We were good.
[32:46.000 --> 32:46.780]  I just need green.
[32:47.560 --> 32:53.040]  Anybody can independently make the jump on Gavin's head, which is what one of us will need to be able to do without stacking.
[32:53.180 --> 32:53.420]  I can't.
[32:54.960 --> 32:56.020]  Let me try.
[32:57.140 --> 32:58.620]  Alright, I'll get a little bit little.
[32:59.520 --> 33:01.040]  Can you jump over me?
[33:02.300 --> 33:03.320]  Goddamn, let me out.
[33:05.560 --> 33:06.460]  Don't get too big.
[33:07.280 --> 33:08.320]  Just my size.
[33:08.480 --> 33:08.820]  My size!
[33:12.140 --> 33:12.580]  Gavin!
[33:12.580 --> 33:13.220]  Gavin!
[33:15.180 --> 33:16.140]  How about that?
[33:16.400 --> 33:17.860]  Now just a little tap.
[33:18.900 --> 33:20.260]  Just run right through it, buddy.
[33:20.460 --> 33:21.800]  There you go.
[33:22.580 --> 33:23.680]  I think he's the same size he was.
[33:25.040 --> 33:26.040]  Yeah, he sure is.
[33:27.260 --> 33:28.600]  The exact same size.
[33:28.740 --> 33:29.920]  Cannot get on him.
[33:30.700 --> 33:31.600]  But he can get on me!
[33:33.340 --> 33:33.700]  Okay.
[33:34.640 --> 33:36.540]  We can all get on Nick, but can we get up there?
[33:37.700 --> 33:38.440]  We only need four.
[33:39.520 --> 33:39.920]  Hang on.
[33:39.920 --> 33:40.200]  Hang on.
[33:42.200 --> 33:43.460]  Geoff, can you jump on top of Nick?
[33:45.560 --> 33:46.280]  And then...
[33:47.140 --> 33:48.120]  Can you jump on Nick?
[33:51.530 --> 33:52.270]  You need to...
[33:52.270 --> 33:52.810]  No, no, no.
[33:53.150 --> 33:53.410]  Come back.
[33:53.530 --> 33:55.510]  You need to be the second person.
[33:55.830 --> 33:57.430]  You need to be on top of Nick.
[33:57.730 --> 33:59.350]  Geoff, come to the left.
[34:00.350 --> 34:02.830]  And then Geoff, jump up here. Jump up with Nick.
[34:04.090 --> 34:04.690]  There you go.
[34:06.150 --> 34:06.510]  Then...
[34:08.250 --> 34:09.930]  Gavin needs to shrink a little again.
[34:09.930 --> 34:11.030]  I was gonna!
[34:12.570 --> 34:13.550]  But you didn't!
[34:17.840 --> 34:19.500]  Alright, I think you nailed it.
[34:19.540 --> 34:19.960]  How's that?
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.060]  Do you want to see if it works?
[34:23.160 --> 34:24.460]  If you can jump on me?
[34:25.740 --> 34:26.240]  How?
[34:27.780 --> 34:30.640]  We need to get someone really small
[34:30.640 --> 34:33.440]  to be on top of...
[34:33.440 --> 34:34.200]  Hang on.
[34:34.400 --> 34:34.640]  Hang on.
[34:34.760 --> 34:34.880]  Hang on.
[34:39.080 --> 34:40.080]  We need...
[34:40.680 --> 34:41.780]  Okay, I have to mute you
[34:41.780 --> 34:43.620]  because I can't talk and think. Hang on.
[34:43.900 --> 34:46.720]  So, if we get someone really small
[34:46.720 --> 34:48.180]  and someone grows really big
[34:48.180 --> 34:49.640]  while they stand on top of them,
[34:49.720 --> 34:51.900]  I think that's the key to what we need to do.
[34:52.660 --> 34:54.760]  I think that's what needs to happen.
[34:55.160 --> 34:57.060]  So, like, if we were all small
[34:57.460 --> 34:58.880]  standing on top of Nick
[34:59.240 --> 35:00.120]  and Nick grows,
[35:01.120 --> 35:02.500]  I think that's what needs to happen.
[35:03.080 --> 35:03.420]  Yes.
[35:03.920 --> 35:05.940]  So, we all need to get really small
[35:09.100 --> 35:09.980]  like this.
[35:10.140 --> 35:11.700]  But, someone has...
[35:11.700 --> 35:14.140]  One person has to start small also
[35:14.140 --> 35:15.920]  and then walk over and grow
[35:15.920 --> 35:16.840]  as we stand on them.
[35:16.980 --> 35:18.120]  I think that's what has to happen.
[35:18.800 --> 35:19.140]  Smart.
[35:20.560 --> 35:21.820]  Let's keep moving then, Gavin.
[35:28.780 --> 35:29.120]  Geoff!
[35:33.340 --> 35:34.780]  So, who's going to be the big man?
[35:35.320 --> 35:36.280]  I'll be the big man.
[35:36.500 --> 35:38.080]  So, we all get on you?
[35:38.840 --> 35:39.960]  We're all going to get on Nick.
[35:40.840 --> 35:41.820]  But Nick needs to keep...
[35:41.820 --> 35:43.460]  No, no, no. Nick has to jump this part.
[35:43.580 --> 35:45.620]  He can't get smaller. He's going to die.
[35:45.660 --> 35:45.920]  Okay.
[35:47.960 --> 35:50.240]  There you go. Now we all jump on Nick.
[35:51.340 --> 35:52.200]  Although, Gavin's a little
[35:52.200 --> 35:52.780]  bigger than me.
[35:54.420 --> 35:56.220]  Well, don't worry. He solved that.
[35:56.640 --> 35:57.500]  Alright, well, get on me then.
[35:57.680 --> 35:58.380]  I'll still get big.
[36:00.960 --> 36:02.220]  It was just nice when you were
[36:02.220 --> 36:03.080]  kind of mid-sized.
[36:03.640 --> 36:04.640]  How can we do this?
[36:04.640 --> 36:06.760]  It's the wrong sizing.
[36:06.840 --> 36:08.640]  We need to do...
[36:09.200 --> 36:09.380]  Okay.
[36:11.580 --> 36:12.360]  There you go.
[36:12.700 --> 36:13.220]  That'll work.
[36:14.100 --> 36:14.640]  Geoff!
[36:16.280 --> 36:18.060]  That's not Geoff's fault.
[36:18.400 --> 36:19.300]  It's not my fault.
[36:20.160 --> 36:21.080]  Thank you.
[36:21.840 --> 36:23.400]  It was a bit of an overshoot.
[36:25.640 --> 36:26.920]  Two, three...
[36:26.920 --> 36:28.640]  And then can Geoff...
[36:28.640 --> 36:30.120]  Hang on.
[36:31.360 --> 36:31.980]  Hang on.
[36:31.980 --> 36:32.820]  I'm trying to get...
[36:34.140 --> 36:35.060]  I'll get a little bit bigger.
[36:35.540 --> 36:35.820]  Here.
[36:37.720 --> 36:38.580]  Now give it a shot.
[36:38.700 --> 36:41.780]  Geoff, can you slot in anywhere or no?
[36:42.260 --> 36:42.520]  No.
[36:43.300 --> 36:44.060]  There we go.
[36:45.460 --> 36:46.520]  It's up to you now, Gavin.
[36:48.220 --> 36:49.120]  A little bigger?
[36:49.740 --> 36:50.440]  Yeah, bigger.
[36:51.380 --> 36:52.800]  As big as you can go without killing us.
[36:54.180 --> 36:55.020]  Just try it.
[36:56.440 --> 36:57.420]  You think so?
[36:57.740 --> 36:58.420]  Just try it.
[36:58.420 --> 36:58.980]  Nope.
[37:01.200 --> 37:01.600]  Only...
[37:01.600 --> 37:04.220]  I can jump and the last person
[37:04.220 --> 37:05.260]  can jump on my head. It's fine.
[37:06.920 --> 37:08.060]  You have the key.
[37:10.760 --> 37:11.160]  Somebody...
[37:11.160 --> 37:12.340]  We'll open the door.
[37:12.860 --> 37:13.820]  Get the key.
[37:14.800 --> 37:15.360]  That's it.
[37:15.580 --> 37:17.440]  Oh, Nick.
[37:19.460 --> 37:20.760]  Don't worry, we'll fix this.
[37:21.160 --> 37:22.900]  Guys, all we needed to do
[37:22.900 --> 37:23.620]  was push the button.
[37:23.700 --> 37:25.800]  It's going to open the walkway for us.
[37:25.800 --> 37:27.960]  He's right. I mean, there are a lot of errors there.
[37:28.080 --> 37:28.560]  It's fine.
[37:28.900 --> 37:31.840]  No, it opens the walkway and then we don't have the key.
[37:31.980 --> 37:32.940]  Oh, that walkway.
[37:33.140 --> 37:35.180]  There's a stupid button.
[37:36.860 --> 37:37.460]  It's okay.
[37:38.180 --> 37:38.500]  We got this.
[37:40.240 --> 37:41.740]  It's evil. It's not alright.
[37:42.560 --> 37:42.980]  Hop on.
[37:43.980 --> 37:45.360]  Can you come to the right instead?
[37:45.700 --> 37:46.200]  Oh, shit!
[37:47.820 --> 37:48.220]  Yeah.
[37:48.720 --> 37:50.180]  You're too big now.
[37:50.380 --> 37:50.920]  Yeah, you're too big.
[37:54.100 --> 37:55.760]  I'm gonna poop.
[37:56.000 --> 37:56.840]  How about that?
[37:57.080 --> 37:57.760]  Now you're too big.
[37:58.900 --> 38:00.500]  Nick being on the wrong side
[38:00.500 --> 38:02.020]  is like mind-boggling to me.
[38:02.140 --> 38:04.500]  I wanna get over there, but the fucker won't move.
[38:04.940 --> 38:05.860]  Yeah, yeah, there's something wrong
[38:05.860 --> 38:07.200]  with everyone else.
[38:07.200 --> 38:08.120]  What is happening?
[38:08.660 --> 38:11.500]  Nick is hanging out.
[38:11.540 --> 38:12.680]  Nick is hanging out.
[38:13.000 --> 38:13.720]  Oh, God.
[38:14.360 --> 38:16.420]  Nick is hanging out.
[38:16.800 --> 38:18.060]  No, you're hanging out.
[38:18.060 --> 38:20.020]  Alright, no, no. Everyone pile on.
[38:20.300 --> 38:21.820]  I'm as far as I can be.
[38:23.340 --> 38:24.180]  Purple, move up.
[38:24.480 --> 38:25.620]  Move up.
[38:26.560 --> 38:26.860]  There you go.
[38:27.860 --> 38:29.460]  No, no, no.
[38:29.520 --> 38:30.160]  Everyone on.
[38:31.760 --> 38:33.100]  And I'll get a little bit bigger.
[38:33.200 --> 38:33.600]  There you go.
[38:35.640 --> 38:37.280]  I'll get big enough for everyone to split.
[38:37.720 --> 38:40.060]  Don't get off me.
[38:42.200 --> 38:43.180]  You can't get back up.
[38:44.740 --> 38:45.500]  Go restart.
[38:52.200 --> 38:53.220]  There we go.
[38:53.220 --> 38:54.300]  Oh, this is gonna be great.
[38:56.740 --> 38:58.680]  I feel like green's too big.
[38:59.200 --> 39:00.020]  No, we're good.
[39:03.820 --> 39:04.920]  That seems alright.
[39:08.800 --> 39:09.660]  Alright, get the key.
[39:10.540 --> 39:11.920]  Get the key. I'll jump.
[39:12.080 --> 39:12.540]  Get the key.
[39:15.420 --> 39:16.420]  We don't need the key.
[39:17.220 --> 39:18.440]  We don't need the key.
[39:18.440 --> 39:20.800]  Oh, okay.
[39:20.980 --> 39:22.340]  We need everyone up there.
[39:23.160 --> 39:23.360]  No.
[39:23.780 --> 39:26.840]  We need the person on the very left to shimmy under before it comes down again.
[39:27.020 --> 39:29.260]  It should be the tallest of us.
[39:29.280 --> 39:30.100]  I'm gonna trust you guys.
[39:30.260 --> 39:31.180]  No, the shortest of us.
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.720]  Who's the most we?
[39:34.380 --> 39:35.300]  Alright, Geoff, you know what you're doing?
[39:36.920 --> 39:38.240]  The red jump over me.
[39:40.700 --> 39:41.480]  Then we go left?
[39:42.040 --> 39:42.800]  No, no, no, just Geoff.
[39:43.380 --> 39:44.880]  Okay, I see, I see.
[39:45.340 --> 39:46.880]  We have to trust Geoff here.
[39:47.940 --> 39:49.080]  Get a feel for it, Geoff.
[39:49.180 --> 39:50.280]  Get a feel for it.
[39:50.280 --> 39:50.620]  That's it.
[39:52.740 --> 39:53.420]  There it is!
[39:54.540 --> 39:56.040]  Perfect! Look at this!
[39:56.160 --> 39:57.640]  Good job, Geoff!
[39:59.380 --> 40:00.280]  Gavin's too big.
[40:00.360 --> 40:01.280]  We'll have to make him smaller.
[40:02.160 --> 40:03.680]  Give somebody else the key, actually.
[40:04.080 --> 40:04.680]  Hang on, hang on.
[40:05.220 --> 40:07.340]  Let me press the give key button.
[40:07.400 --> 40:09.260]  Shut up, shut up.
[40:10.520 --> 40:11.920]  My god, dummy!
[40:13.080 --> 40:13.820]  There we go.
[40:13.840 --> 40:14.800]  Oh god, no.
[40:16.340 --> 40:17.960]  I'll do it, don't worry.
[40:18.140 --> 40:19.800]  Can I fit through that?
[40:20.300 --> 40:21.100]  Let's find out.
[40:21.420 --> 40:22.480]  No, I think you're too big.
[40:23.120 --> 40:25.600]  Oh, thank god!
[40:28.340 --> 40:29.880]  That was only two!
[40:30.180 --> 40:31.040]  Give someone the key.
[40:35.750 --> 40:36.950]  What do you want from me?
[40:40.270 --> 40:41.930]  So immediately down the bottom
[40:41.930 --> 40:42.990]  and then start dodging.
[40:44.210 --> 40:44.690]  Damn.
[40:45.790 --> 40:47.870]  Whoa, Andrew, way to go!
[40:48.890 --> 40:49.970]  Do we have to take
[40:49.970 --> 40:51.430]  shelter under our star block?
[40:51.610 --> 40:53.270]  Let's all agree to go one direction.
[40:54.070 --> 40:54.690]  Let's go right.
[40:55.770 --> 40:56.990]  We're all going right.
[40:57.230 --> 40:58.130]  You gotta go left, Eric.
[40:59.370 --> 41:00.750]  I don't have to go left.
[41:02.310 --> 41:03.610]  Everyone can go one way.
[41:03.650 --> 41:04.450]  Everyone goes right.
[41:06.350 --> 41:06.590]  Huh.
[41:07.890 --> 41:09.450]  No huh, just go right.
[41:09.450 --> 41:10.590]  Just hold right.
[41:10.930 --> 41:11.430]  I did.
[41:12.730 --> 41:14.750]  If you hold too far right,
[41:15.090 --> 41:16.130]  you land on the next block.
[41:16.690 --> 41:19.010]  Yep. Nope.
[41:20.750 --> 41:21.510]  Then we gotta
[41:21.510 --> 41:22.230]  jump at the bottom.
[41:23.250 --> 41:23.430]  Yep.
[41:26.210 --> 41:26.630]  Damn.
[41:27.090 --> 41:29.150]  Son of the back of my dick.
[41:30.710 --> 41:31.810]  Mark the Frog said
[41:31.810 --> 41:33.290]  you guys are exhausting to watch sometimes.
[41:33.610 --> 41:34.150]  God damn!
[41:34.150 --> 41:34.270]  Damn!
[41:37.310 --> 41:38.210]  Just hold right.
[41:40.910 --> 41:41.270]  Shitbags!
[41:41.490 --> 41:42.570]  How am I getting down there?
[41:43.870 --> 41:46.250]  If you're not on the far left, it's much harder.
[41:46.410 --> 41:47.790]  If you're in one of the upper spots,
[41:48.010 --> 41:48.990]  it's harder to do.
[41:50.890 --> 41:52.230]  If you're on a lower spot,
[41:52.270 --> 41:54.150]  it's much easier because you just drop straight to the floor.
[41:54.510 --> 41:54.870]  God.
[41:56.850 --> 41:58.090]  I don't think I've ever
[41:58.090 --> 42:00.070]  survived being on the top block.
[42:00.230 --> 42:00.910]  No, it's hard.
[42:00.910 --> 42:02.070]  It's fucking...
[42:02.070 --> 42:03.470]  I was on the lower one.
[42:08.850 --> 42:09.970]  I can't just fucking...
[42:10.710 --> 42:11.550]  That was pretty alright.
[42:12.010 --> 42:12.570]  That was pretty good.
[42:16.560 --> 42:17.040]  Oops.
[42:20.860 --> 42:21.480]  What if
[42:21.480 --> 42:23.560]  everyone gets under the ledge on the right?
[42:23.760 --> 42:24.200]  On the left?
[42:26.500 --> 42:26.980]  What?
[42:27.500 --> 42:28.020]  I don't know.
[42:29.460 --> 42:31.400]  Well, at least you don't know.
[42:36.560 --> 42:37.620]  Ah, I went too far.
[42:40.620 --> 42:42.260]  If we started in the same spot
[42:42.260 --> 42:43.480]  every time, it would be so much easier.
[42:44.020 --> 42:44.360]  Yes!
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.740]  This is a real cunt on the level.
[42:50.260 --> 42:51.420]  Yeah, it's a real...
[42:51.880 --> 42:52.240]  Bullshit.
[42:55.700 --> 42:57.040]  You just had to go up.
[42:58.480 --> 42:58.660]  Ah!
[43:01.160 --> 43:01.920]  I'm so used to
[43:01.920 --> 43:03.640]  not making it through the first wave.
[43:03.640 --> 43:04.800]  Fuck!
[43:06.160 --> 43:06.340]  Ah.
[43:07.040 --> 43:08.680]  Wow. Everybody.
[43:12.170 --> 43:12.910]  Damn it.
[43:13.210 --> 43:13.370]  Ah.
[43:15.230 --> 43:16.630]  Thanks, GDuff. Appreciate you.
[43:17.270 --> 43:19.190]  Thank you so much, GDuff.
[43:19.490 --> 43:20.170]  Thanks, Nick.
[43:21.070 --> 43:22.730]  Yeah, go ahead.
[43:23.430 --> 43:25.390]  I landed and I didn't expect
[43:25.390 --> 43:25.950]  to be alive.
[43:29.050 --> 43:29.650]  That's
[43:29.650 --> 43:30.850]  the excuse.
[43:31.850 --> 43:33.270]  It's not an excuse, it's the truth.
[43:35.090 --> 43:35.570]  I
[43:35.570 --> 43:37.470]  landed and I didn't expect to be alive.
[43:38.170 --> 43:39.670]  I didn't. I expected to be a corpse.
[43:39.910 --> 43:40.250]  Ah!
[43:42.670 --> 43:43.370]  I thought
[43:43.370 --> 43:45.590]  everyone made it there and then everyone kept going through the floor.
[43:46.510 --> 43:46.990]  Ah!
[43:47.970 --> 43:48.630]  Thanks, Nick.
[43:49.850 --> 43:51.270]  You're coming to my side.
[43:52.290 --> 43:53.230]  I went right.
[43:53.870 --> 43:55.030]  We're all going right.
[43:55.330 --> 43:56.910]  I just...
[43:56.910 --> 43:58.450]  How fucking far right are you going?
[43:59.210 --> 44:00.550]  How do I keep landing on you?
[44:00.550 --> 44:02.810]  I don't know. Great question for you.
[44:03.510 --> 44:04.730]  That was pretty good.
[44:05.430 --> 44:06.950]  Tuspot, thank you.
[44:07.570 --> 44:08.090]  Tosspot?
[44:09.270 --> 44:10.170]  Ah! God!
[44:11.310 --> 44:12.470]  Gavin, are you going left?
[44:13.810 --> 44:14.890]  Did I go left?
[44:15.490 --> 44:16.370]  Oh my god.
[44:17.270 --> 44:18.790]  I asked you and then
[44:18.790 --> 44:20.270]  you just didn't go that time.
[44:21.970 --> 44:22.570]  Fuck!
[44:22.710 --> 44:23.870]  Yeah, I went left.
[44:25.350 --> 44:25.950]  Why?
[44:26.350 --> 44:28.310]  I'm just going under the one I was on.
[44:29.730 --> 44:30.170]  What?
[44:30.530 --> 44:31.610]  Ah, shit.
[44:32.530 --> 44:33.250]  No, yeah, you're right.
[44:35.410 --> 44:36.370]  Right about going left?
[44:36.450 --> 44:37.090]  God damn.
[44:38.310 --> 44:40.370]  Why would you go left?
[44:40.930 --> 44:42.090]  Hey guys, just
[44:42.090 --> 44:44.450]  calling it out. We're never going to beat this level.
[44:44.690 --> 44:45.370]  We're getting this.
[44:45.690 --> 44:47.810]  This is easy.
[44:48.030 --> 44:49.750]  Now that we know that Gavin's going left.
[44:50.190 --> 44:51.030]  Fuck me!
[44:51.850 --> 44:53.050]  I was going right then left.
[44:54.110 --> 44:55.050]  Well, two of us made it.
[44:55.050 --> 44:56.830]  Yeah, I do realize
[44:56.830 --> 44:58.750]  sometimes I cut back left just because
[44:58.750 --> 45:00.510]  it's easier to dodge that way.
[45:02.790 --> 45:04.910]  Because to the right is taken sometimes.
[45:05.230 --> 45:06.950]  Yeah, well sometimes you'll end up
[45:06.950 --> 45:07.590]  on the other platform.
[45:07.750 --> 45:07.890]  Yes.
[45:10.310 --> 45:11.990]  It's not too easy to plot.
[45:13.310 --> 45:13.790]  I jumped.
[45:16.250 --> 45:17.030]  You killed
[45:17.030 --> 45:17.690]  yourself faster.
[45:19.830 --> 45:20.430]  Wow!
[45:21.610 --> 45:22.210]  Three!
[45:22.210 --> 45:23.450]  Three, that's a record.
[45:25.430 --> 45:25.910]  Relived.
[45:27.470 --> 45:28.430]  The jump
[45:28.430 --> 45:30.490]  at the same time as everyone died was very funny.
[45:32.910 --> 45:34.850]  Fuck man, I hate being on top.
[45:35.550 --> 45:35.890]  It's tough.
[45:36.550 --> 45:37.070]  Yeah, it's rough.
[45:41.610 --> 45:42.090]  Sucks.
[45:43.290 --> 45:44.610]  We were touching faces, Eric.
[45:45.570 --> 45:46.130]  Don't go left.
[45:46.790 --> 45:46.950]  Ah!
[45:47.710 --> 45:48.590]  Did we do it?
[45:48.590 --> 45:48.970]  Yeah!
[45:50.270 --> 45:51.830]  I think someone was already dead.
[45:53.910 --> 45:54.250]  Oh, wow.
[45:54.430 --> 45:55.070]  What the fuck?
[45:55.270 --> 45:57.990]  I felt like that was a late start or something. That was bizarre.
[46:02.830 --> 46:04.350]  Yeah, I think if you're on an upper block
[46:04.350 --> 46:05.550]  you have to go back the other way.
[46:07.270 --> 46:08.330]  But you don't know if you...
[46:08.330 --> 46:10.330]  Dude, I have no idea what block I'm on
[46:10.330 --> 46:11.370]  until I just start going.
[46:11.650 --> 46:14.250]  Yeah, you just...
[46:14.250 --> 46:16.510]  The upper block is tough.
[46:16.510 --> 46:17.330]  It's so tough.
[46:17.830 --> 46:19.570]  We're consistently pulling three.
[46:21.050 --> 46:21.610]  Ah!
[46:21.910 --> 46:24.010]  Someone said, don't move right away, evaluate the situation.
[46:24.190 --> 46:26.010]  Right, so we'll die instantly instead.
[46:26.270 --> 46:26.690]  Good call.
[46:27.390 --> 46:28.150]  Evaluate the situation?
[46:28.290 --> 46:28.830]  There's one...
[46:28.830 --> 46:33.890]  Yeah, just don't listen to the chat ever.
[46:34.390 --> 46:34.490]  What?
[46:34.810 --> 46:36.610]  There's one frame to evaluate.
[46:38.130 --> 46:40.290]  I think we should listen to everything
[46:40.290 --> 46:42.090]  the chat asks us to do.
[46:42.710 --> 46:43.070]  Shit.
[46:43.070 --> 46:44.290]  Until someone gets it.
[46:45.650 --> 46:47.430]  If no one moves, the spikes don't move.
[46:47.430 --> 46:48.430]  Oh, is that true? Let's try it.
[46:49.350 --> 46:50.090]  Okay, sorry.
[46:50.450 --> 46:51.490]  I was so locked in.
[46:53.130 --> 46:53.890]  Let's not move.
[46:54.650 --> 46:56.970]  Did someone move automatically the first time we did this?
[46:57.510 --> 46:57.910]  Nope.
[46:58.670 --> 46:59.070]  Again.
[47:00.690 --> 47:02.130]  Don't listen to the chat. It's pretty exciting.
[47:05.430 --> 47:06.410]  Me and Gavin.
[47:08.630 --> 47:09.210]  FinalStorm says,
[47:09.390 --> 47:10.150]  try closing your eyes.
[47:10.770 --> 47:12.050]  Okay, I did.
[47:12.150 --> 47:12.790]  Did I do it?
[47:13.250 --> 47:14.470]  Two of us lived that time.
[47:17.850 --> 47:18.810]  Too far.
[47:19.770 --> 47:21.290]  Two of us lived that time.
[47:22.790 --> 47:23.870]  We're going backwards.
[47:24.770 --> 47:25.010]  Fuck.
[47:25.590 --> 47:26.450]  Ah, shit.
[47:26.930 --> 47:28.170]  Two of us.
[47:30.290 --> 47:32.050]  Just hold right as soon as it starts.
[47:32.830 --> 47:33.310]  Yes!
[47:34.070 --> 47:34.510]  Four.
[47:35.030 --> 47:36.310]  Wow, someone landed an upper.
[47:37.550 --> 47:38.970]  Somebody landed an upper.
[47:38.970 --> 47:39.130]  Ah!
[47:39.570 --> 47:41.970]  Someone from the upper lived, I mean.
[47:45.570 --> 47:46.590]  God damn it.
[47:46.950 --> 47:48.070]  Damn dick.
[47:48.990 --> 47:52.650]  I think we can't hold right the whole time.
[47:52.770 --> 47:54.150]  I think we have to like...
[47:54.150 --> 47:54.310]  Yeah.
[47:55.330 --> 47:56.810]  It's like a...
[47:56.810 --> 47:58.230]  It's like a starting gun.
[47:59.110 --> 48:00.310]  Damn it.
[48:01.590 --> 48:02.450]  Nice job, Eric.
[48:03.130 --> 48:04.190]  You went left.
[48:05.330 --> 48:06.650]  No, you saved me.
[48:06.710 --> 48:07.650]  When you got off in time.
[48:10.470 --> 48:10.870]  Whoa!
[48:12.030 --> 48:14.030]  20 gifted subs, Monfane.
[48:14.150 --> 48:15.650]  Thank you. You killed me.
[48:15.750 --> 48:18.310]  Thank you so much, Monfane.
[48:18.470 --> 48:19.530]  That was a Monfane death.
[48:20.070 --> 48:20.910]  That was a Monfane death.
[48:20.910 --> 48:23.370]  You played that one just right.
[48:23.730 --> 48:26.070]  The block that you start on is the block
[48:26.070 --> 48:27.090]  you should be using as cover.
[48:27.590 --> 48:28.730]  If you can.
[48:29.970 --> 48:30.370]  Wow.
[48:31.010 --> 48:32.030]  Four of us.
[48:34.940 --> 48:35.900]  Oh shit!
[48:36.460 --> 48:39.560]  Bad touch.
[48:42.100 --> 48:42.880]  Nailed it.
[48:44.080 --> 48:45.840]  That was the closest one.
[48:46.900 --> 48:48.360]  We all made it to the ground
[48:48.360 --> 48:49.260]  before we died.
[48:50.360 --> 48:50.660]  Damn it.
[48:51.140 --> 48:52.180]  Damn dick.
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.520]  Just under. Straight under.
[48:57.780 --> 48:58.160]  Love it.
[48:59.840 --> 49:00.900]  We got this.
[49:00.900 --> 49:03.180]  So close.
[49:03.720 --> 49:04.120]  This is it.
[49:04.700 --> 49:05.660]  Next one's it.
[49:06.380 --> 49:07.660]  I think it is right then left.
[49:07.780 --> 49:09.440]  That's crazy.
[49:13.220 --> 49:15.340]  I jumped too late.
[49:15.700 --> 49:16.240]  Netcode.
[49:17.420 --> 49:17.940]  Netcode.
[49:21.220 --> 49:21.980]  Okay.
[49:23.260 --> 49:24.080]  We're consistently getting four.
[49:26.500 --> 49:27.200]  Love it.
[49:29.900 --> 49:31.100]  We're making improvements.
[49:32.980 --> 49:33.760]  Back under.
[49:34.000 --> 49:34.160]  Yes!
[49:34.400 --> 49:34.840]  That's on me.
[49:38.200 --> 49:40.240]  I'm so scared to see what's next.
[49:40.560 --> 49:41.100]  Upper.
[49:42.280 --> 49:43.700]  You just gotta go
[49:43.700 --> 49:44.920]  straight under your block.
[49:50.140 --> 49:51.640]  I jumped too soon.
[49:54.160 --> 49:55.100]  You anticipated.
[49:55.440 --> 49:56.120]  Which is a good thing.
[49:58.000 --> 49:58.560]  Oh.
[49:58.720 --> 50:00.080]  I thought we all made it.
[50:02.640 --> 50:03.980]  Oh, what the?
[50:05.360 --> 50:05.860]  What's up, Blue?
[50:07.200 --> 50:07.940]  What's up?
[50:11.200 --> 50:12.280]  Okay, what's happening?
[50:13.500 --> 50:14.800]  I died up top.
[50:18.580 --> 50:20.060]  That hit your eyelid.
[50:20.900 --> 50:21.560]  Yeah, sure did.
[50:22.500 --> 50:23.400]  This is the one.
[50:30.390 --> 50:32.030]  I said this is the one and then I thought
[50:32.030 --> 50:34.850]  maybe it will be the one and I freaked out.
[50:37.690 --> 50:41.660]  How did I get here?
[50:42.880 --> 50:44.220]  That's okay, Green died too.
[50:44.800 --> 50:45.400]  I'm Green.
[50:50.940 --> 50:51.400]  Yes!
[50:55.680 --> 50:56.140]  Alright.
[50:56.880 --> 50:57.300]  Now what?
[50:58.660 --> 50:59.280]  Everyone get back.
[50:59.280 --> 50:59.740]  Get back.
[51:00.540 --> 51:01.460]  Do you think it shoots?
[51:01.920 --> 51:04.320]  Does it shoot?
[51:04.820 --> 51:05.840]  I don't think so.
[51:06.260 --> 51:11.240]  I'm gonna stay here and you guys
[51:11.240 --> 51:12.920]  can use me as a platform to jump up
[51:12.920 --> 51:13.920]  and then on and over.
[51:14.380 --> 51:15.480]  There you go.
[51:16.960 --> 51:17.780]  Good call.
[51:18.200 --> 51:20.040]  What does this button do?
[51:20.280 --> 51:22.020]  Let's talk about what we're doing next.
[51:22.720 --> 51:24.180]  Who wants to give it a shot?
[51:24.760 --> 51:25.660]  I'll go over.
[51:25.660 --> 51:26.780]  Red, you wanna go over?
[51:31.540 --> 51:33.480]  We all have to stay down there.
[51:33.600 --> 51:34.180]  One person.
[51:34.480 --> 51:36.320]  Jump into the safety hole.
[51:37.860 --> 51:39.240]  Don't worry, I got it.
[51:43.980 --> 51:44.420]  Dammit.
[52:01.560 --> 52:03.000]  There's something so infuriating
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.940]  about seeing try again typed out.
[52:05.400 --> 52:06.160]  Why, just try again.
[52:06.960 --> 52:07.700]  What happened there?
[52:08.440 --> 52:09.580]  I think Nick died.
[52:09.760 --> 52:11.100]  I was mad about try again.
[52:12.420 --> 52:13.880]  That one was just shit.
[52:22.080 --> 52:23.340]  Who's gonna be the person?
[52:23.820 --> 52:24.920]  Who wants to have the guts?
[52:25.040 --> 52:25.800]  Who's gonna have the guts?
[52:26.920 --> 52:28.240]  You go ahead, Gavin.
[52:28.780 --> 52:29.760]  Gavin's got guts.
[52:31.300 --> 52:32.820]  Do you have it?
[52:33.580 --> 52:34.600]  Wow, way to go.
[52:35.660 --> 52:36.860]  Alright, here we go.
[52:37.740 --> 52:38.300]  Here we go.
[52:39.440 --> 52:40.640]  I thought I wasn't gonna make that jump.
[52:40.780 --> 52:40.840]  Move.
[52:45.200 --> 52:45.520]  Okay.
[52:46.520 --> 52:47.640]  We could get one more level.
[52:48.400 --> 52:48.880]  What's that?
[52:50.620 --> 52:51.800]  I don't know, you're on my head.
[52:51.800 --> 52:52.480]  I don't think we hit it.
[52:54.100 --> 52:55.240]  I think we have to.
[52:57.120 --> 52:57.960]  Should we see?
[52:59.080 --> 53:00.160]  Yeah, we have to.
[53:00.160 --> 53:01.680]  I bet it drops on the ceiling.
[53:02.000 --> 53:02.300]  Okay.
[53:05.540 --> 53:07.700]  Do you think we all stand on this?
[53:08.100 --> 53:09.100]  We all stack?
[53:10.260 --> 53:12.320]  Get into a really straight stack.
[53:12.680 --> 53:13.600]  Get into a pencil.
[53:14.140 --> 53:15.580]  And then I just press this, do I?
[53:15.660 --> 53:16.620]  Yeah, I think so.
[53:19.400 --> 53:20.440]  Just go!
[53:20.960 --> 53:23.700]  Open the door!
[53:25.980 --> 53:28.020]  Everyone just stood there!
[53:30.160 --> 53:30.900]  Who died there?
[53:31.340 --> 53:32.480]  I died.
[53:33.160 --> 53:34.860]  Because I was in the clusterfuck.
[53:36.280 --> 53:38.040]  Okay, well we got it at least.
[53:38.500 --> 53:38.680]  No!
[53:40.440 --> 53:41.960]  Everyone just stood there.
[53:42.820 --> 53:43.440]  I didn't.
[53:43.980 --> 53:45.300]  I died for it.
[53:45.720 --> 53:46.280]  You died.
[53:47.440 --> 53:49.700]  I was chilling in the green room.
[53:49.720 --> 53:51.320]  We were done, me and Geoff were done.
[53:51.500 --> 53:53.100]  Me and Geoff, the MVPs, we were done.
[53:54.120 --> 53:55.320]  Nice, okay, easy.
[53:55.900 --> 53:56.920]  Alright, Gav, you're the legend.
[54:00.990 --> 54:01.510]  Easy!
[54:08.810 --> 54:09.850]  Looking nice.
[54:10.610 --> 54:11.790]  It's looking lovely.
[54:12.630 --> 54:13.770]  Did we need to do that stack thing?
[54:13.770 --> 54:15.090]  I don't think so.
[54:15.550 --> 54:18.930]  Just let the key person jump on the other side of this.
[54:20.010 --> 54:21.110]  Get over here.
[54:21.250 --> 54:23.090]  Definitely be on the other side of this.
[54:24.270 --> 54:25.410]  So, key person.
[54:25.810 --> 54:26.750]  There you go.
[54:26.750 --> 54:27.310]  Alright, ready?
[54:28.270 --> 54:30.170]  No, stop, Nick!
[54:30.370 --> 54:33.010]  Oh my god, you took the double!
[54:33.510 --> 54:34.790]  You fucking animal!
[54:36.890 --> 54:38.250]  You're so lucky!
[54:38.630 --> 54:39.990]  Oh my god, you're so lucky!
[54:41.010 --> 54:41.510]  Holy shit!
[54:42.230 --> 54:44.750]  I think we need a slow-mo replay
[54:45.870 --> 54:48.230]  for the VOD of...
[54:48.230 --> 54:48.830]  God damn.
[54:49.030 --> 54:50.310]  Who did what there? Was that Nick?
[54:50.730 --> 54:51.130]  Yes.
[54:51.430 --> 54:53.110]  Oh boy.
[54:53.110 --> 54:54.790]  Oh, shit.
[54:55.250 --> 54:56.190]  What is this business?
[54:58.390 --> 54:58.750]  No.
[54:59.930 --> 55:00.810]  Alright, stack on eight.
[55:01.430 --> 55:04.250]  Alright, I'll get the key.
[55:05.190 --> 55:07.050]  I don't even understand what's happening yet.
[55:07.050 --> 55:07.590]  Yeah, I don't either.
[55:08.470 --> 55:10.850]  I think we gotta get people up on the...
[55:11.490 --> 55:13.470]  I really have no idea.
[55:13.610 --> 55:14.890]  I don't know what's going on.
[55:15.370 --> 55:17.150]  Maybe we should all just try to get on the eight.
[55:18.890 --> 55:19.950]  We need the key, though.
[55:20.530 --> 55:22.050]  We're just trying to figure out
[55:22.050 --> 55:23.170]  what the mechanics are.
[55:27.360 --> 55:29.020]  I just don't get it.
[55:29.360 --> 55:31.180]  The person who's on the bottom
[55:31.880 --> 55:33.120]  can run to the lip.
[55:33.300 --> 55:35.320]  Oh, it's telling you what we need to...
[55:35.840 --> 55:37.500]  No, that's just a ghost of what we did.
[55:37.800 --> 55:40.020]  Every time the ring hits the outer edge
[55:40.020 --> 55:41.160]  it disappears the blocks.
[55:42.800 --> 55:44.360]  So you have to jump when it hits the edge.
[55:44.360 --> 55:44.580]  Got it.
[55:46.680 --> 55:48.340]  So everyone just hold right.
[55:48.860 --> 55:49.000]  Yeah.
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  Get off me.
[55:51.980 --> 55:53.400]  Everyone is stacked.
[55:53.820 --> 55:54.760]  Get off me.
[55:55.100 --> 55:56.380]  Yeah, as in, like, start moving.
[55:57.800 --> 55:59.100]  We need to stack on eight
[55:59.100 --> 56:01.000]  and then everyone needs to start on the blocks.
[56:01.320 --> 56:03.000]  One person goes left.
[56:04.060 --> 56:04.920]  Everyone else goes right.
[56:05.420 --> 56:06.560]  That is what needs to happen.
[56:06.940 --> 56:09.040]  So, Andrew, you're gonna be the designated
[56:09.040 --> 56:10.900]  go left guy. Everyone else is holding right
[56:10.900 --> 56:11.660]  the whole time I'm going.
[56:13.060 --> 56:14.700]  I think that's what needs to happen.
[56:15.480 --> 56:17.160]  Everyone else is holding right off the rib.
[56:17.580 --> 56:17.940]  Okay.
[56:22.840 --> 56:23.700]  I think jump
[56:23.700 --> 56:25.620]  was implied, but that's on me. So you're gonna want
[56:25.620 --> 56:26.360]  to jump also.
[56:26.460 --> 56:28.600]  I was definitely trying to jump, but there were people in my head.
[56:30.280 --> 56:31.380]  Yeah, I know that feeling, bud.
[56:37.780 --> 56:39.780]  How is the stack breaking apart so quickly?
[56:46.040 --> 56:46.400]  Surely...
[56:46.400 --> 56:48.200]  I think we should take a minute and see whoever's
[56:48.200 --> 56:49.840]  at the bottom. The top goes left.
[56:49.960 --> 56:50.960]  It changes every time.
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.500]  So we take a moment.
[56:52.920 --> 56:54.620]  So the middle person
[56:54.620 --> 56:56.200]  doesn't need to walk out of the stack.
[56:56.460 --> 56:57.900]  Right, but somebody needs to get the key.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.180]  The top person should get the key.
[57:00.980 --> 57:02.440]  Well, but then there's no gap!
[57:03.400 --> 57:03.860]  There's no gap!
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.560]  So the second person
[57:06.560 --> 57:07.560]  needs to step off, right?
[57:09.140 --> 57:10.060]  Whoever's number two,
[57:10.320 --> 57:12.240]  step off the person's head to the right.
[57:12.340 --> 57:13.280]  Okay, I'm on the bottom.
[57:13.840 --> 57:14.960]  And then the bottom one...
[57:14.960 --> 57:16.980]  Why the hell?
[57:18.320 --> 57:19.840]  Let's take a moment and see.
[57:20.340 --> 57:21.500]  So whoever's number two
[57:21.500 --> 57:23.780]  can walk the rest of the stack onto the edge.
[57:24.800 --> 57:25.880]  That would've been me.
[57:26.180 --> 57:27.640]  But yeah, that makes sense. So you would go,
[57:27.720 --> 57:28.240]  and then I would go.
[57:29.160 --> 57:30.700]  I don't follow, I'm sorry.
[57:31.780 --> 57:32.480]  It's Andrew!
[57:33.720 --> 57:35.300]  Nobody move unless you're second.
[57:35.440 --> 57:36.600]  And if you're second, go right.
[57:37.640 --> 57:38.440]  Onto the block.
[57:40.500 --> 57:40.700]  Okay.
[57:42.360 --> 57:42.780]  Gavin.
[57:43.320 --> 57:45.580]  So Gavin, you need to walk us to the edge.
[57:46.780 --> 57:47.780]  This is me.
[57:47.780 --> 57:49.100]  And then I jump.
[57:49.940 --> 57:50.860]  And then...
[57:50.860 --> 57:52.220]  Nobody got the key.
[57:53.580 --> 57:54.600]  So we'd be dead.
[57:55.520 --> 57:57.500]  But I think it's better to
[57:57.500 --> 57:59.840]  run across the top because you have a safety net
[57:59.840 --> 58:00.320]  if you fall.
[58:03.100 --> 58:03.560]  Okay.
[58:03.860 --> 58:04.280]  Get the key.
[58:05.460 --> 58:07.360]  You cannot make them jump back.
[58:08.840 --> 58:09.780]  So it's gonna be
[58:09.780 --> 58:10.340]  a break.
[58:11.360 --> 58:13.780]  No, I think bottom guy has to
[58:13.780 --> 58:15.720]  go left then right, but I really don't know.
[58:15.720 --> 58:16.500]  I have no idea.
[58:17.640 --> 58:20.020]  And then see if there's enough time to go right as well.
[58:20.180 --> 58:20.620]  Geoff, go!
[58:22.160 --> 58:25.920]  Well, that was a bit of a delay there.
[58:26.020 --> 58:26.840]  It might be enough time.
[58:28.340 --> 58:28.620]  Yes!
[58:30.020 --> 58:30.360]  Let me up!
[58:31.300 --> 58:32.040]  Andrew, go!
[58:34.300 --> 58:36.100]  He's taking his time, he's figuring it out.
[58:37.020 --> 58:37.620]  Sorry, Geoff.
[58:37.620 --> 58:39.360]  Geoff, that's okay.
[58:41.000 --> 58:41.860]  Andrew's taking his time.
[58:42.100 --> 58:42.400]  Don't worry.
[58:44.280 --> 58:44.720]  Ah!
[58:44.860 --> 58:45.780]  He's headed the wrong way.
[58:50.680 --> 58:52.540]  Alright, the first bit's
[58:52.540 --> 58:53.900]  sorted though. Yes! No!
[58:54.040 --> 58:54.380]  No!
[58:54.660 --> 58:57.780]  Eric, why?
[59:01.140 --> 59:02.340]  Why what? I don't even know what I'm doing.
[59:02.380 --> 59:03.000]  I fucked up.
[59:03.920 --> 59:06.420]  The bottom person runs left then right
[59:06.420 --> 59:07.920]  and then the second person jumps to the...
[59:07.920 --> 59:10.720]  There was no jumping, I was stuck.
[59:10.720 --> 59:11.920]  I mean, walking over.
[59:12.480 --> 59:14.600]  He's just saying you walked off before we got to the
[59:14.600 --> 59:15.480]  ledge block.
[59:18.220 --> 59:18.680]  Alright, it's blue
[59:18.680 --> 59:20.160]  and purple. Got it.
[59:20.360 --> 59:20.880]  Nice.
[59:22.040 --> 59:22.560]  Ah!
[59:23.700 --> 59:24.220]  Ah!
[59:24.940 --> 59:25.460]  Okay.
[59:29.740 --> 59:30.260]  Go.
[59:30.800 --> 59:31.640]  Go, he says.
[59:32.980 --> 59:33.500]  Perfect.
[59:35.540 --> 59:35.740]  Oh!
[59:36.640 --> 59:36.860]  Ah!
[59:38.900 --> 59:40.320]  Okay, let's just get the jump.
[59:41.840 --> 59:42.860]  Now we just
[59:42.860 --> 59:44.200]  gotta jump properly.
[59:45.040 --> 59:46.120]  Oh, god damn it.
[59:46.240 --> 59:48.480]  I waited too long.
[59:50.060 --> 59:50.940]  How many
[59:50.940 --> 59:51.780]  people can we get up top?
[59:54.120 --> 59:54.560]  Sorry.
[59:54.900 --> 59:56.760]  I thought that you were gonna go and you
[59:56.760 --> 59:57.880]  had gone and I ran.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:00.900]  I was about
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.180]  to go.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:02.500]  Ah!
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.200]  Ah!
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.160]  Oh, that's
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:07.340]  great.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.120]  Blue!
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.460]  Appreciate it, Gavin.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.240]  Locked in.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.720]  Locked in.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.480]  Ah!
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.540]  Oh, no!
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.200]  My timing's
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:23.800]  just too quick.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.460]  It's me!
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.060]  Oh!
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.280]  Ah!
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.160]  Ah!
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:44.880]  Ah, sorry.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.880]  I love that one.
[01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.100]  Just stand in there.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.660]  Just stand in there.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.340]  I just wasn't ready to be the guy.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.300]  But here I am.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.780]  And I did it right.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:13.740]  Nightlord!
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.460]  Fifty subs!
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.080]  Geoff didn't bother getting the key.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.720]  Thank you so much, Nightlord.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.380]  Thank you, Nightlord. This is dedicated to you.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.480]  How many subs?
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.080]  Fifty. Five-zero?
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.700]  God damn, he really is a Nightlord.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.160]  Thank you, Nightlord.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:33.300]  Hey.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.420]  Fighter of the Daylord.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.340]  Geoff came off the top
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:39.940]  of the stack.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.660]  He just started hitting buttons.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.580]  I fell off, yeah.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.080]  The important thing is that I tried to
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.140]  keep a show with them.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.480]  Look at how well I did up top.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.400]  You're on the top, you have to go!
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.280]  I did, eventually.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.940]  We can take a time, like we have eight seconds.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.340]  Also, yeah, I'm wondering
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.200]  the person who's on the bottom
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.200]  Oh my god!
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.400]  Eric, that was you?
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.400]  Anyway, I was saying the person
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.380]  who's first and who has to join us on the
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.900]  eight block, maybe they climb to the top
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.440]  and there's a second runner on the top row.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:21.400]  What?
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.960]  While we have the eight seconds, we should let the person
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.240]  who joins last on the platform together.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.040]  Like this.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.360]  Climb up. Nevermind.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.620]  I don't know why we're trying to newly strategize.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.940]  I'm just about to unplug my Xbox and computer.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.120]  So, it doesn't matter.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.060]  Unplug my phone.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.040]  Unplug everything.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.680]  But we all know what we're doing, right?
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.220]  Yeah.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.800]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.040]  He's doing it too slowly, apparently.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.240]  Gavin, what the...
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:02:59.860]  He got nervous.
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.040]  I was so happy I got the key.
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.620]  He went right.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.980]  He went right.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.720]  He went right.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.620]  He went right.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.440]  Move. Go. Andrew, move.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.060]  What?
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.020]  We can take...
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.020]  There's still four seconds left.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.880]  We don't need to be so panicked.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.460]  We have eight seconds. Take a fucking moment.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.000]  Take a breath. Relax.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.160]  We're all gonna make it.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.780]  We don't need to just instantly go.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.200]  The block's reset.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.120]  I knew what I was doing.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.720]  It was just the block was about to reset,
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.600]  so I was waiting for it, so I wouldn't fall
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.640]  as soon as I jumped.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.020]  Any thoughts on that one?
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.220]  No, I was just...
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.580]  I was just gathering his thoughts.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.160]  Who the goddamn
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.240]  at the bottom of the stack walked us all off?
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.080]  I moved one step too far.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.200]  Oh, oh, thumb shit!
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.660]  I don't even...
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:01.200]  I know! I know the rule!
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.400]  I know the rule!
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.180]  Do we have eight seconds on that one, Andrew?
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.840]  No, that's the first one.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.020]  You only got one on that one.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.080]  It's the block that has eight. You have eight seconds.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.500]  Oh, come on, Gavin!
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.020]  Oh, there's technically one that does do that,
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.960]  but the first one does supposed to do the other thing.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.420]  Help, assholes!
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:22.780]  Goddamn.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.800]  No, Andrew's right. We have time.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.740]  You're never dying
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.500]  because we took too much time.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.140]  Outside of that.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.500]  The last one there.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:34.200]  I thought it was me at the bottom.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.200]  Because we took too much time.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.640]  That one, we did die from taking too much time.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.200]  Ah, fuck.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.960]  Relax, let the person above you go first.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:44.700]  Relax.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.680]  I think we can get two up top, right?
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:48.920]  Gavin! Relax.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.700]  We can get two up top
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.060]  if we let the person who was originally first
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.080]  on the bottom
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.380]  climb back to the top.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.880]  If we give them room to climb.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:04:59.940]  I'm trying.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.680]  That's on me.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.220]  I'm just a fucking idiot.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.060]  That is absolutely on me.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.700]  I accept full responsibility.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.840]  That was too fast.
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:13.640]  I jumped the gun.
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.260]  It's alright.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.480]  Fuck me.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.000]  Geoff?
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:21.640]  Don't worry guys, I'll make it.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.740]  It's 5-0-5.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.040]  Woo.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.260]  Okay.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.540]  Make the stats, make the stats.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:30.740]  Give him space, Andrew!
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.340]  Hey, Andrew, stop all the
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.020]  fucking assholes.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.420]  Andrew's got all the time in the world, baby.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.220]  Geoff, you fucking asshole.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.260]  Geoff didn't die because he didn't have time.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.260]  That was dying because he didn't have enough time.
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.020]  It keeps, it keeps, he says it,
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.800]  and then it's him. It's the best.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:50.420]  It's happened so many times now.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.780]  Let me up, let me up.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.020]  Doesn't matter, we're all good.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.120]  Alright.
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:58.860]  Oh.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:05:59.800]  Oh.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.500]  One person needs to definitely be up the top.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:01.860]  Right.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.100]  Stairs it, stairs it.
[01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:16.950]  So anyway, May 11th
[01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:18.790]  at 11am guys, you wanna be, you wanna be
[01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.350]  right here, you wanna be watching us play Mario Party,
[01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.930]  have some really, yeah,
[01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:25.570]  11am central, we're gonna have some really awesome surprises
[01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:27.390]  for you guys, really cool stuff happening.
[01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.170]  Really excited to be there.
[01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:31.110]  For sure won't be this bullshit.
[01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:32.490]  Let go, god damn.
[01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:35.470]  No, he's got all the time in the world!
[01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:36.150]  Go, go!
[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.430]  He's got all the time in the world!
[01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:40.110]  So that top one is moving.
[01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.630]  We timed it out well that time.
[01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:45.210]  Fuck me! I was staring at it like a
[01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.410]  fucking dumbass.
[01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:50.330]  Nice, Geoff!
[01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:51.190]  Stairs.
[01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:53.390]  That's it. Lovely.
[01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:54.890]  Oh fuck, that's okay.
[01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.350]  Oh fuck, that wasn't.
[01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.810]  I timed that perfectly wrong.
[01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.950]  Geoff,
[01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:06.290]  all over the place.
[01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:07.470]  I was trying to make room.
[01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:10.170]  You're fine, you're at the bottom.
[01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:12.170]  Damn it!
[01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.310]  I unfortunately had my eyes closed
[01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.050]  when that started.
[01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:21.570]  All the time in the world.
[01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:24.590]  You know when you're pinching your nose
[01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:25.870]  but it closes your eyes a little?
[01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.650]  Oh yeah.
[01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:30.870]  Perfect quick stairs.
[01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:31.230]  Look at that.
[01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:34.430]  Oh no!
[01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:35.510]  You're okay.
[01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:37.030]  Oh shit!
[01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:39.170]  Doing great up there, Nick.
[01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:40.050]  That was great. Good work.
[01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:41.590]  Nick, you're just teasing the top one.
[01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:44.770]  Oh fuck me, I thought I was second. I'm sorry.
[01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:47.190]  You still would have gone too early
[01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.770]  if you were second.
[01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:52.990]  God, I haven't been on the bottom for so long, I'm scared.
[01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:55.310]  Alright, lovely.
[01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:56.470]  This is great.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.860]  What was that noise?
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.340]  It's me.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:09.820]  Just slapping my...
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:11.940]  my desk.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.440]  What the fuck is going on there?
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.520]  I thought the second person was going up top
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.120]  but they came down.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.540]  Doesn't really matter.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.440]  All the time in the world.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.900]  What's this going on here?
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.840]  Oh my god!
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.500]  And then did we just run?
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.540]  I have no idea, I guess.
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:50.120]  I don't know.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.140]  I hit my head on that one, sorry.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.580]  I hate this.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:12.300]  We don't have all the time
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:12.760]  in the world.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:14.900]  That's not what I heard.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.520]  We have a lot of time but
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.180]  when the three people at the bottom are watching the thing go down
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.960]  from two to one and they gotta go
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.140]  but it's the wrong time to go
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.480]  That's all the time in the world.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.940]  It means we probably waited too long.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:28.700]  I agree.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.360]  Yeah.
[01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:40.050]  You better jump!
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.440]  Fuck!
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.380]  At least I hate this song.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:06.660]  Fuck!
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:11.760]  Okay.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:11.860]  Okay.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:13.820]  Oh shit!
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.080]  Sorry Geoff, I didn't mean to keep this thing moving.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:36.880]  That's okay, I made it.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.700]  I know, but...
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.320]  Fuck.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.220]  It knows who's talking.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:44.940]  It puts them on the bottom.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:46.940]  Oh my god.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.620]  We may have left the stack again.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.140]  As long as it doesn't
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.300]  collapse, we're good.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.760]  Sometimes I'm killed by blinking.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.560]  No!
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.300]  Fuck me.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.420]  Just fuck me!
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.480]  Fuck this!
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:29.800]  Fuck you!
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.320]  Fuck me! Fuck them!
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.140]  Oh shit!
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:33.560]  Wild.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.060]  I panicked just like Gavin did that time.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.060]  Which time?
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:39.800]  Name one.
[01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.630]  Stupid!
[01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:03.350]  Sorry, that was on me. That was the block.
[01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.130]  I went through the block
[01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:07.690]  and I landed on Gavin's head and I caused him to die.
[01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:10.150]  Solid.
[01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:10.830]  That was also on me.
[01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.530]  Put it on the board!
[01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:14.350]  All the time in the world.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.300]  What are you guys doing?
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.800]  I got
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.640]  hot, Ben.
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:34.700]  Fucking hell.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:35.440]  That was brutal.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:36.500]  Too brutal.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:40.900]  Oh no!
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.680]  Every time I lean back on my chair,
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.320]  it's my turn.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.260]  Don't do that.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.560]  Everyone's just going apeshit
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.360]  at the beginning now.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.480]  What happened to the other one?
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.380]  He's over his skis.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.880]  That's interesting.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:02.760]  What?
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.360]  Just that you can do that.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.320]  Oh my god!
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.040]  What the fuck netcode bullshit was that?
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.880]  Wow, that sucked.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.640]  I'm sorry. That was brutal.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.700]  Oh my god, no!
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.600]  Sorry.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.480]  I'm not used to this.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.740]  Go, go, go!
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.500]  There's not going to be enough time!
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.000]  All the time
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.500]  in the world.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.120]  All the time
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.380]  in the world.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.260]  You killed me!
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:57.400]  I killed us both!
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.540]  Oh no!
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.740]  Okay, I got five more minutes
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.420]  of this, then I quit.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.340]  You're already here, audience.
[01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.610]  That was bad.
[01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:31.330]  He just
[01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:32.910]  shoot himself.
[01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:36.250]  I don't even know what's funny anymore.
[01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:37.650]  Fucking dickhead.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.800]  Fuck!
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.520]  My damn pencil!
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.280]  I fell apart!
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.160]  My fucking thumb
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.380]  fell off the controller when I tried to push
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:00.780]  the button.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:06.240]  Oh, I fell apart, man.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.180]  That was so funny.
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.280]  That was legitimately too funny.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.280]  Oh, Geoff, he just started going left
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.080]  and right, dude. I didn't know what to do.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.840]  That was so fucked.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.720]  That was so funny.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.340]  Oh, shit. Fuck me.
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:24.220]  Oh, fuck.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.380]  Oh my god.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.380]  We're doing it!
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:29.900]  Shut up!
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.620]  Come to the right!
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:32.840]  Now just run!
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.360]  Oh, you...
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.620]  Oh, dick!
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.440]  I don't know. You're all the way to the back.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.700]  You gotta be forward. You gotta go forward. You gotta go.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.860]  We're so close.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:43.780]  We gotta go.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.040]  Gotta go.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.240]  Gotta go.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:49.800]  Fuck me.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:51.980]  Guys?
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:53.300]  Gotta go.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.420]  That was me.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:58.680]  Sorry.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.120]  Sorry.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.620]  Gavin going, what?
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.380]  I was freaking out laughing again.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:13.300]  My heart's gonna pop.
[01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:21.970]  It's only gone
[01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:23.190]  for like a frame.
[01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:24.450]  It sure is.
[01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.970]  Oh my fucking god.
[01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:34.250]  I had that locked in.
[01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:35.630]  God damn it.
[01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.050]  Eat my own asshole.
[01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:42.210]  Honestly,
[01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:43.190]  a guy like me
[01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.030]  can't wait for May 11th
[01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:48.410]  at 11am for an anniversary stream
[01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:49.770]  where we play Mario Party
[01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:50.690]  instead of this.
[01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:52.990]  A guy like me can't wait for that.
[01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:02.150]  Nope.
[01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:02.830]  No!
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.660]  You fucking idiot.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.100]  I tried.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.740]  Oh my
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.880]  fucking god.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.580]  That was not there for me.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.500]  That was brutal.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.920]  It was always me at the beginning.
[01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:37.870]  Oh god.
[01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:40.390]  That was Geoff.
[01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:42.430]  Geoff, that wasn't on you.
[01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:43.850]  That's my first death.
[01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:44.910]  That's my first death.
[01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:48.170]  Took you a long time to get there.
[01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:57.370]  Alright, we're off.
[01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:58.830]  All the way right.
[01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:00.830]  Go, go, go.
[01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:03.510]  That was me. I'm sorry.
[01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:04.630]  Not even that.
[01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:08.410]  I think Geoff may have jumped too early.
[01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:14.830]  I quit with what Nick just said.
[01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:16.370]  I couldn't do anything. He broke me.
[01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:19.290]  My name is Geoff.
[01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:24.070]  It's the bag.
[01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:27.690]  My name is Geoff.
[01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:29.030]  Geoff.
[01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:30.610]  Geoff.
[01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:34.530]  My name is Geoff.
[01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.930]  He turned into Borat.
[01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:40.850]  It's a challenge.
[01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:45.290]  Jesus Christ, dude.
[01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:49.220]  I'm losing it.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.040]  I am freaking out.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.040]  Wow, that was the best stairs we've ever done.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.640]  God damn it.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.020]  Why do I keep timing that wrong?
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.440]  I wish you wouldn't.
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.680]  Come on, Geoff. Be nice.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.020]  Oh shit.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.240]  Oh shit.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.040]  You fucking assholes.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.060]  Well, it sucks to be the last guy to get to jump there.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:34.960]  You're just completely at the whim of everybody else.
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.760]  Get off, get off, get off. What are you doing?
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.700]  What were you doing up there?
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:45.900]  Oh, fuck.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.300]  Oh, no.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.120]  Oh, God.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.160]  Geoff.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.360]  Come on.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:02.980]  Geoff.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:09.180]  Hey, Gavin, you're getting so fast
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.820]  that you can go back and forth now.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.440]  Geoff.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.860]  Jump the gun.
[01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:23.150]  Fuck me.
[01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:29.170]  101, I'm green.
[01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:33.910]  I can't wait to see the actual count for deaths here.
[01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:38.190]  Did you just keep going?
[01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:44.130]  God damn it, Blue.
[01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:46.370]  See, now here's the thing, Geoff.
[01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:48.910]  Geoff, here's why I'm saying I'm excited to see the count.
[01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:50.810]  Because that counting is a death for you.
[01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:51.850]  Which is insane.
[01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:53.650]  Yeah, because that was on my part.
[01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:56.330]  Exactly. That's why I'm excited to see the actual death count.
[01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:58.850]  I got kill fucked by Blue.
[01:20:59.370 --> 01:20:59.850]  That's my fault.
[01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:04.370]  Chalk that one up to Geoff.
[01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:05.110]  Yep.
[01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.570]  Geoff.
[01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:14.870]  You left before I got up there.
[01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:15.870]  You didn't need me.
[01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:17.890]  I died.
[01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.950]  Move!
[01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:24.910]  All the time in the world.
[01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.090]  Red wasn't going to let it happen that time,
[01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:27.930]  so I threw in the towel.
[01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:30.350]  Green.
[01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:32.570]  Green was fine.
[01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:33.570]  Yellow, Blue.
[01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.330]  Blue.
[01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.770]  Geoff!
[01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:51.570]  It was unfortunate, but I lived.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.300]  Nick, what?
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.360]  Allow me some grace for a moment.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.240]  Nick just fucking nose-dived into an empty pool.
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:20.980]  Ugh.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.100]  I...
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.660]  We'll be laughing out there.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.800]  This Nick is not...
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.380]  He struggles with this one.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:40.780]  No, it's fine.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.040]  Oh, shit.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.160]  Oh, shit!
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.800]  You kinda fucked me there, Blue.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.300]  Well, I just looked at you.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.020]  I didn't touch you.
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.800]  You went backwards,
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.080]  and then stopped me from jumping to the next block.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.360]  I sucked you out.
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.840]  Well, me jumping to a block
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.720]  is kinda dependent on you not already being there.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.900]  That was just terrible.
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.400]  That was a full bar.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:14.580]  What?
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.620]  I gotta not worry about being at the top.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.120]  When there's one other person at the top, and I'm up there,
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.780]  I start sweating like, oh, they're gonna move the thing too fast.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.380]  And I need to not worry about that.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.320]  What happened to our stack there?
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.360]  It's stacked all apart somehow.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.880]  Someone in the middle started going left.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.560]  Who knows?
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.240]  I wonder who it could've been.
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:05.880]  Oh, I'm on my platform.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.080]  It was so close!
[01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:27.230]  Game!
[01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:27.850]  Zero movement.
[01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:50.250]  Hi.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:08.180]  You guys okay?
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:09.740]  I'm good.
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.980]  Are you?
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:12.920]  Nope.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.160]  DICKHEAD!
[01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:34.150]  There's so many deaths!
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.220]  Oh, boy.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.740]  I need to piss so bad.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.060]  I didn't even get the key.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:46.660]  Nope.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.820]  Oh, my God.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.880]  The goddamn fourth person doesn't have to wait.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:11.780]  Okay.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.720]  But it's worked so far!
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:17.420]  What has worked?
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.240]  What has worked?
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.640]  We've made it to the end two times.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]  Three times.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.920]  I made it.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:26.480]  I made it.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:28.380]  That was on me.
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.260]  That's like monkeys flinging shit
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:33.700]  at a computer until they accidentally
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:34.620]  hit the power button.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.740]  It worked eventually.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.040]  We're still playing the game.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.460]  Nah, I'm flinging shit.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:46.760]  Fucking dickhead.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.500]  Just a little dickhead.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.400]  Who?
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.340]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:07.190]  Okay.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:11.960]  I don't know.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.120]  Stack below me moves, so nothing I can do.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:18.800]  Yep.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.560]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:27.500]  Fucking bad timing.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.060]  Yeah, dude.
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.460]  I did the same thing, though. It's okay.
[01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:40.310]  So ominous.
[01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:47.090]  Suck your own
[01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:48.810]  fucking...
[01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:49.630]  Ah, you idiot.
[01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:50.930]  I don't know what to do.
[01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:59.950]  I need to not worry about the person
[01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:01.270]  in front of me. That's so hard.
[01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:11.310]  528? It's way past 501.
[01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:19.770]  You asshole!
[01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.890]  That's okay.
[01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:26.290]  The important thing is...
[01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:27.730]  What the fuck?
[01:28:28.530 --> 01:28:35.540]  Ah, move, move.
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.080]  Too fast on that timing, fuck.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.360]  Is today the same day it was earlier?
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.300]  Jesus Christ.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.740]  Take your time.
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:49.380]  Thanks, man.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.120]  Wow.
[01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:05.410]  Oh, no!
[01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.610]  Geoff.
[01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:08.710]  Geoff.
[01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:09.850]  Geoff!
[01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:17.930]  I'm still recovering
[01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:18.870]  from the last mistake.
[01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:20.410]  I'll need a second.
[01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:22.910]  Unhappy with that.
[01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:23.430]  Ah!
[01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:30.290]  Oh, my fucking God.
[01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:38.690]  I need to pee.
[01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:41.430]  Give it one more minute.
[01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.930]  Five more tries, and then we're done.
[01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:46.470]  Five more tries, then a piss break, and then we'll have to be it.
[01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.470]  No!
[01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:49.290]  No!
[01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:51.570]  Four more.
[01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:54.370]  This is it.
[01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:54.870]  This is the one.
[01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:59.590]  I was too busy thinking about
[01:29:59.590 --> 01:30:00.790]  saying that thing that I said.
[01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:02.790]  Instead of doing the thing I should have done.
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:06.640]  Garrett!
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:08.840]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:09.780]  Two!
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.380]  I got piss on the brain.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:17.640]  We broke it again.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:18.860]  Oh, for Christ's sake.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.580]  It's okay. We're okay.
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:20.980]  Oh!
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:23.840]  It's all good.
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:28.700]  One.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.040]  Last one, and we're done.
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.500]  This is a piss break. We're done.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:36.240]  One more, because Gavin
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.140]  wasn't paying attention.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.120]  It's piss break.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.160]  Negative one.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:41.840]  It's done.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.340]  We gotta go on a good try.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:46.680]  This is it.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:47.840]  Like if we do it?
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.700]  Well, that would be a good try.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.120]  What?
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:53.780]  It's okay.
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.800]  It was pretty medium. We could do better.
[01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:07.550]  Oh, fuck.
[01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:09.450]  We didn't get anyone on the top.
[01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.190]  Fuck.
[01:31:16.690 --> 01:31:17.810]  Okay, that'll be the one
[01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:19.510]  to end it on. Thank you guys so much
[01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.970]  for watching.
[01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:22.690]  That was crazy.
[01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:24.110]  To just go right there.
[01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:27.010]  Okay, alright. That's it.
[01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:28.650]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
[01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:32.130]  Watch this Tuesday.

[01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:34.310]  Thanks for watching.
[01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:36.490]  Appreciate everyone coming through.

[01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:57.970]  This is the time.
[01:31:59.150 --> 01:32:00.110]  Alright, bye.
