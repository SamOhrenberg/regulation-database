[00:00.000 --> 00:05.720]  Is your cat's name... Is your cat's name Garfield 2?
[00:06.600 --> 00:10.240]  Yeah. My cat is the second Garfield.
[00:17.630 --> 00:23.210]  Garfield 2. It's such a like kid's way of naming an animal.
[00:23.710 --> 00:26.150]  Oh, Coco died. This is Coco 2.
[00:27.770 --> 00:30.090]  Ah, it's Santa's little helper 2.
[00:30.930 --> 00:32.290]  Oh, fuck, man.
[00:34.910 --> 00:37.610]  Snowball 2. Garfield 2.
[00:38.030 --> 00:38.990]  Gavin, what's the name of your cat?
[00:39.670 --> 00:39.910]  Gobbler.
[00:41.050 --> 00:41.350]  What?
[00:42.250 --> 00:42.690]  Gobbler.
[00:43.170 --> 00:45.410]  Oh, Gobbler. That's pretty awesome.
[00:45.730 --> 00:47.650]  Did you guys just get a screen for Mission 1?
[00:48.310 --> 00:49.010]  No. No.
[00:49.870 --> 00:52.070]  Go to the quest board. Go talk to Alma.
[00:52.670 --> 00:53.910]  Are you ready to go?
[00:54.930 --> 00:58.550]  I think you say, yeah, yeah, like, let's head out. Is that what you're supposed to do?
[00:58.830 --> 00:59.310]  Try that.
[00:59.850 --> 01:01.330]  I'm looking at someone's back.
[01:01.930 --> 01:04.090]  Open the... yeah, head out or open the quest board.
[01:04.690 --> 01:05.370]  Uh, head out.
[01:05.690 --> 01:06.430]  Yeah, okay.
[01:07.790 --> 01:09.350]  All right, well, let's go get back to your village.
[01:09.430 --> 01:10.090]  All right, let's head out.
[01:10.570 --> 01:10.810]  All right.
[01:11.610 --> 01:14.990]  Hopefully this puts you in the same mission. Andrew's just kind of like doing the mission now, I think.
[01:15.550 --> 01:17.030]  Why is that? Why is everyone speaking German?
[01:23.810 --> 01:24.630]  What's going on?
[01:24.990 --> 01:27.330]  What's going on with these guys? Just walking around.
[01:27.330 --> 01:29.730]  It's not like it's a size village at all.
[01:30.050 --> 01:31.170]  He's been lying to us.
[01:31.570 --> 01:34.330]  I don't know what they said. I skipped all the talking, but...
[01:34.990 --> 01:36.210]  I can't understand it.
[01:37.070 --> 01:39.170]  Gavin, did you turn on the wrong region?
[01:39.650 --> 01:41.250]  Yeah, are you playing the game in German?
[01:42.030 --> 01:42.510]  Apparently.
[01:43.690 --> 01:45.150]  But you speak German.
[01:46.110 --> 01:46.530]  Authorization?
[01:49.630 --> 01:52.010]  Now I gotta kill Balachi, apparently?
[01:57.960 --> 01:59.780]  Okay, I'm killing monsters at least now.
[02:00.480 --> 02:01.760]  Yeah, but just not with anyone, right?
[02:01.960 --> 02:05.220]  No, but it's like baby monsters. It's like a...
[02:05.220 --> 02:06.740]  I think this is still kind of tutorial.
[02:07.280 --> 02:08.880]  They'll eventually become real monsters.
[02:10.160 --> 02:13.180]  I think I finally got to the town that's not the town, I hear.
[02:13.640 --> 02:15.420]  Okay, now this looks like a real monster.
[02:18.060 --> 02:19.680]  Okay, return to base camp. Okay.
[02:21.480 --> 02:23.920]  I think once we head back to base camp, now it'll work.
[02:27.140 --> 02:27.500]  Mittagessen.
[02:28.920 --> 02:29.860]  He said lunch.
[02:33.990 --> 02:37.430]  We're just gonna keep cutting to Gavin's footage. It's not gonna make any sense.
[02:41.670 --> 02:44.190]  I can tell it's Gavin's footage because it's in German.
[02:49.710 --> 02:51.450]  Come on, Nick, kill these bugs.
[02:52.010 --> 02:52.870]  I'm working on it.
[02:53.070 --> 02:55.750]  Yeah, you gotta kill the bugs and then you head back to camp and I think we're good.
[02:59.980 --> 03:01.120]  What's everybody packing?
[03:01.760 --> 03:02.740]  I got that big sword.
[03:03.780 --> 03:05.880]  That nightmare-looking sword from Soulcalibur.
[03:07.960 --> 03:09.520]  You never see their genitals.
[03:10.940 --> 03:12.140]  You'd think they'd be hard to miss.
[03:13.160 --> 03:13.700]  That thing's huge.
[03:13.820 --> 03:14.960]  The monster genitals?
[03:15.260 --> 03:15.500]  Yeah.
[03:17.940 --> 03:19.140]  I'm getting bugged.
[03:19.840 --> 03:21.580]  Yeah, the Cloverfield monster didn't have a dick.
[03:22.440 --> 03:22.960]  Yeah, right?
[03:23.540 --> 03:24.680]  Didn't he have little babies, though?
[03:24.800 --> 03:25.700]  Could've been on his back.
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.180]  That's a great point.
[03:30.400 --> 03:31.460]  Packing heat on the back.
[03:36.420 --> 03:39.820]  I'm not very good at slaying Blackie or whatever they're called.
[03:44.580 --> 03:47.480]  The way you say it sounds offensive and I don't know why.
[03:48.940 --> 03:49.920]  Oh, it does sound offensive.
[03:50.520 --> 03:52.060]  Are you fighting a big monster now?
[03:52.280 --> 03:53.720]  I'm now fighting a big monster.
[03:54.520 --> 03:55.440]  Wait, without us?
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.520]  Without us?
[03:57.480 --> 04:00.260]  You're acting like I chose this, like I know what I'm doing.
[04:00.380 --> 04:02.200]  Yes, without you. I'm just here.
[04:02.820 --> 04:04.720]  Johnny Caviar sent you a quest invitation.
[04:05.040 --> 04:05.480]  Oh, cool!
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.080]  Oh, here we go. Invitation list.
[04:08.520 --> 04:10.580]  There you go. Hit it.
[04:10.820 --> 04:13.120]  It's blocked out. You cannot do this right now.
[04:13.140 --> 04:14.040]  You cannot do this right now.
[04:14.800 --> 04:16.500]  Finish your preparation and talk to Alma.
[04:16.900 --> 04:18.520]  Alright, let's see if we can remember how to play.
[04:21.580 --> 04:23.220]  Wait, I can accept and...
[04:23.220 --> 04:24.500]  No, I can't.
[04:24.500 --> 04:25.280]  What?
[04:26.120 --> 04:27.440]  It let me accept...
[04:27.440 --> 04:27.980]  Quest invitation.
[04:30.700 --> 04:31.100]  Really?
[04:31.800 --> 04:34.000]  It did, but then I got hit for a second.
[04:34.580 --> 04:35.620]  Yeah, it gave me an error as well.
[04:36.100 --> 04:36.620]  I'm accepting.
[04:37.220 --> 04:37.800]  Heading back.
[04:37.840 --> 04:38.060]  Okay.
[04:38.240 --> 04:39.560]  Alright, Nick, I think you have to accept it.
[04:40.040 --> 04:40.520]  There it is.
[04:41.660 --> 04:42.700]  Accept and depart. Yeah.
[04:44.280 --> 04:44.680]  God!
[04:44.940 --> 04:46.920]  An error because you got hit?
[04:47.580 --> 04:49.240]  Maybe. Let me get away from him.
[04:49.660 --> 04:50.500]  He's following me!
[04:50.660 --> 04:52.040]  Of course he follows you.
[04:52.860 --> 04:53.920]  So where's Johnny Caviar?
[04:53.920 --> 04:54.480]  Baby Pepsi!
[04:55.100 --> 04:55.520]  Hey, what's up?
[04:56.160 --> 04:56.420]  Hey!
[04:56.760 --> 04:57.860]  How did you get in each other?
[04:59.300 --> 05:01.980]  He sent an invite and I accepted it and I said, join.
[05:02.880 --> 05:03.440]  I got an error.
[05:03.740 --> 05:04.340]  I gotta beat the clock.
[05:04.420 --> 05:04.840]  Gotta beat the clock.
[05:05.400 --> 05:06.680]  Go, go, go, go.
[05:07.000 --> 05:07.920]  I'm coming, baby Pepsi!
[05:09.140 --> 05:09.600]  Let me in!
[05:09.980 --> 05:10.460]  Let me in!
[05:10.800 --> 05:11.040]  Yeah!
[05:12.620 --> 05:13.300]  Oh, here we go.
[05:13.420 --> 05:13.880]  Just in time.
[05:14.700 --> 05:15.520]  How did you do it?
[05:16.340 --> 05:16.940]  So, I accept it.
[05:17.100 --> 05:19.380]  Gavin, I think you gotta collect the honey first, buddy.
[05:20.520 --> 05:22.260]  Do I have to kill this...
[05:22.260 --> 05:22.660]  No.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.560]  We're fighting the thing now as a group.
[05:25.800 --> 05:27.220]  Yeah, but how do I fight it?
[05:27.580 --> 05:27.860]  Join.
[05:28.040 --> 05:28.220]  With the group.
[05:28.580 --> 05:29.120]  Set the invite.
[05:29.860 --> 05:30.460]  With the group.
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.420]  With the group.
[05:32.920 --> 05:34.560]  BabyPepsi in Garfield 2 is getting in it!
[05:36.040 --> 05:36.980]  Hold on, fellas!
[05:37.240 --> 05:37.880]  I'm a-coming!
[05:38.140 --> 05:38.620]  I'm with ya!
[05:40.300 --> 05:41.940]  Have no fear, Gizmo's here!
[05:42.280 --> 05:46.840]  I think if I was a fan of Monster Hunter and I was watching this video, I would be, like, furious.
[05:47.340 --> 05:48.640]  I'd be very upset, yes.
[05:48.700 --> 05:48.860]  Yeah.
[05:49.040 --> 05:50.000]  I was just thinking that.
[05:51.040 --> 05:52.380]  Yeah, I probably would too.
[05:54.700 --> 05:55.880]  Oh, fuck!
[05:56.640 --> 05:57.340]  How did you do that?
[05:57.920 --> 05:59.000]  I just got hit.
[05:59.980 --> 06:01.180]  Where did the fire come from?
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.160]  His tail.
[06:02.300 --> 06:02.480]  That guy?
[06:02.860 --> 06:03.860]  He's got a flame tail.
[06:04.380 --> 06:05.300]  Can someone invite me?
[06:08.140 --> 06:09.020]  Invitation list.
[06:11.260 --> 06:12.600]  Oh no, I'm in a bad way.
[06:12.720 --> 06:14.120]  How do you, uh, how do you heal?
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.680]  Uh, I don't remember.
[06:15.720 --> 06:20.420]  Uh, left bumper and then push X or B to your heal, uh, potions.
[06:20.420 --> 06:21.060]  Gah!
[06:21.680 --> 06:24.100]  Every time I try to join, I get smashed in the back.
[06:24.680 --> 06:25.680]  You gotta run away from it.
[06:26.140 --> 06:27.240]  Yeah, you have to run away from it.
[06:27.340 --> 06:28.280]  That's the only way you can join.
[06:28.420 --> 06:30.000]  I ran behind a rock and hid.
[06:33.740 --> 06:34.100]  Okay.
[06:38.740 --> 06:39.500]  Oh, jump away!
[06:39.560 --> 06:40.120]  How are you guys doing?
[06:40.120 --> 06:40.460]  Jump away!
[06:40.700 --> 06:41.440]  Nombrod has accepted.
[06:42.860 --> 06:43.220]  Great.
[06:44.180 --> 06:44.920]  I'm just healing.
[06:45.780 --> 06:46.400]  I'm chopping.
[06:47.100 --> 06:47.940]  Oh, that was a good hit.
[06:48.120 --> 06:50.080]  Ah! Let's do this shit!
[06:50.360 --> 06:50.800]  Oh, he's running!
[06:50.920 --> 06:51.320]  He's running!
[06:51.560 --> 06:51.900]  He's running!
[06:51.900 --> 06:52.980]  Catch the coward!
[06:53.280 --> 06:53.600]  Kill him!
[06:54.340 --> 06:55.480]  How do you whistle?
[06:56.020 --> 06:56.200]  Whistle?
[06:56.520 --> 06:57.500]  Up on the d-pad.
[06:57.560 --> 06:58.180]  Up on the d-pad!
[06:59.040 --> 06:59.600]  Chase him!
[06:59.920 --> 07:01.220]  Chocobo! Chocobo! To me!
[07:01.920 --> 07:02.900]  Is Nombrod here yet?
[07:03.300 --> 07:03.780]  Oh, there we go.
[07:03.820 --> 07:04.740]  Nombrod is doing the quest.
[07:06.820 --> 07:07.900]  Welcome to Monster Hunter!
[07:08.340 --> 07:09.260]  We're hunting a monster!
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.480]  Let us know how much of the previous bit made the video.
[07:12.660 --> 07:13.760]  26 minutes in.
[07:13.820 --> 07:15.580]  It's time to fight this monster, baby.
[07:15.900 --> 07:16.580]  Don't worry, guys.
[07:16.780 --> 07:17.960]  Gobbler and Nombrod are here.
[07:18.520 --> 07:20.100]  Gobbler and Nombrod?!
[07:21.060 --> 07:21.860]  Holy shit!
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.100]  He's come to save us!
[07:24.980 --> 07:26.100]  Where are you guys at?
[07:26.580 --> 07:28.240]  We're over here fighting the shit out of this thing.
[07:28.480 --> 07:28.960]  Oh, shit.
[07:30.360 --> 07:30.860]  Swing it!
[07:32.900 --> 07:34.400]  What weapon did you pick?
[07:35.920 --> 07:36.320]  Greatsword?
[07:36.580 --> 07:36.800]  Yep.
[07:37.080 --> 07:39.140]  I picked the fast thing.
[07:39.480 --> 07:39.760]  Whatever the fast thing is.
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.260]  I think he's spinning!
[07:40.420 --> 07:40.700]  He's spinning!
[07:40.820 --> 07:41.120]  He's spinning!
[07:41.540 --> 07:42.800]  I picked the saxophone.
[07:42.980 --> 07:44.020]  Roll, roll, roll!
[07:44.520 --> 07:45.200]  You picked what?
[07:45.340 --> 07:46.200]  Roll, roll, roll!
[07:46.200 --> 07:46.820]  Got a saxophone.
[07:46.820 --> 07:48.000]  Roll, roll, roll!
[07:48.680 --> 07:51.180]  Like music soothes the savage beast?
[07:52.620 --> 07:53.160]  Whack!
[07:53.400 --> 07:54.800]  Eat my sax, bitch!
[07:56.540 --> 07:57.460]  Focus strike!
[08:00.260 --> 08:01.260]  Focus strike!
[08:01.520 --> 08:02.020]  What does that mean?
[08:03.400 --> 08:06.540]  You focus strike when they have a weakness.
[08:06.660 --> 08:07.340]  Oh, I'm on fire!
[08:08.280 --> 08:09.300]  Where's your weakness, buddy?
[08:09.560 --> 08:10.820]  I'm stabbing his toe.
[08:11.020 --> 08:11.880]  Oh, it's on his toe.
[08:19.240 --> 08:20.400]  He's going for the tail.
[08:20.960 --> 08:21.940]  What was heal again?
[08:22.720 --> 08:27.460]  Uh, you have to hold left bumper and then cycle to your potions with X or B.
[08:28.040 --> 08:30.940]  And then you just push X to use them.
[08:31.340 --> 08:31.860]  Holy dick!
[08:31.860 --> 08:32.940]  I don't have any potions.
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.520]  You should.
[08:35.720 --> 08:36.680]  I don't.
[08:37.140 --> 08:38.160]  Bam! Wound destroyed.
[08:44.560 --> 08:45.840]  Shit, I missed.
[08:50.950 --> 08:52.370]  Trying to chop his tail off.
[08:52.450 --> 08:52.890]  Oh, there they are.
[08:53.870 --> 08:55.330]  Can we chop his tail off?
[08:55.330 --> 09:00.390]  A lot of monsters you typically can and then you can get additional resources for doing it.
[09:00.630 --> 09:02.530]  That would also probably throw his equilibrium off.
[09:02.810 --> 09:03.810]  Uh, you would think, yeah.
[09:03.850 --> 09:05.190]  That's a real disadvantage.
[09:05.610 --> 09:06.550]  Oh, he's staggered.
[09:09.550 --> 09:10.890]  Does he have a new wound yet?
[09:11.710 --> 09:12.950]  Not that I can see.
[09:14.930 --> 09:15.910]  Mechanic said, wonderful.
[09:16.630 --> 09:18.050]  Oh, let's chop him, Geoff!
[09:18.570 --> 09:19.770]  He's down, he's down, he's down.
[09:22.010 --> 09:23.390]  Shit, I'm out of position.
[09:27.570 --> 09:27.970]  Ooh!
[09:28.690 --> 09:30.190]  Get them chops in, get them chops in!
[09:30.990 --> 09:32.070]  Dude, I'm playing mad tunes.
[09:34.450 --> 09:36.170]  Oh, you rotting him, Knob?
[09:36.570 --> 09:37.530]  You knob rotting him?
[09:37.590 --> 09:38.550]  I'm trying to rot in his knob.
[09:40.330 --> 09:41.630]  Can you hear my horn?
[09:42.070 --> 09:42.650]  I do.
[09:44.110 --> 09:45.950]  Oh my god, dude, I just saw your horn.
[09:46.090 --> 09:46.690]  Holy shit.
[09:50.190 --> 09:52.390]  All right, finally figured out the health thing.
[09:53.410 --> 09:54.370]  So I'm back.
[09:54.650 --> 09:56.090]  All right, I want to play a different tune.
[09:56.090 --> 09:57.250]  I want to play Sonic Waves.
[09:57.330 --> 09:57.750]  How do I do that?
[09:58.110 --> 09:58.730]  Wow, we're talking.
[10:01.450 --> 10:02.910]  Why did I change my health?
[10:03.750 --> 10:04.870]  Oh, I'm gonna get this guy.
[10:04.970 --> 10:06.490]  Let's get this other guy into the mix.
[10:07.070 --> 10:08.650]  Oh, I cut his tail off!
[10:08.870 --> 10:09.650]  That's disgusting.
[10:10.290 --> 10:11.270]  That's cool as hell.
[10:12.890 --> 10:14.770]  And you want that, right?
[10:15.770 --> 10:16.430]  I assume so.
[10:16.810 --> 10:18.610]  Uh, guys, I got this bear thing involved.
[10:18.870 --> 10:19.870]  I got a bear thing involved.
[10:20.290 --> 10:23.730]  Why did Andrew just add a different monster?
[10:23.730 --> 10:25.190]  I think let's bring him.
[10:25.370 --> 10:26.410]  Let's have him fight each other.
[10:26.490 --> 10:27.070]  Let's have him.
[10:27.250 --> 10:28.090]  Let's chase this guy.
[10:28.110 --> 10:28.650]  Oh shit.
[10:28.690 --> 10:31.090]  Oh god, there's a there's a croc on me.
[10:31.390 --> 10:32.390]  Run, get on your things.
[10:32.470 --> 10:33.270]  He's chasing me.
[10:33.450 --> 10:34.650]  He's chasing me.
[10:35.050 --> 10:35.630]  You got to get him.
[10:35.730 --> 10:36.470]  He's escaping.
[10:36.610 --> 10:36.970]  Go get him.
[10:37.050 --> 10:37.950]  Hurry, let's get him.
[10:37.950 --> 10:38.270]  We're going.
[10:38.610 --> 10:39.770]  He just crashed into a wall.
[10:40.070 --> 10:40.850]  Is this the right way?
[10:41.350 --> 10:41.810]  Where is he?
[10:43.950 --> 10:45.510]  I think we're going way off.
[10:45.730 --> 10:47.010]  Oh shit, I'm behind the bear.
[10:47.190 --> 10:48.530]  The bear is behind you.
[10:48.530 --> 10:50.010]  I'm chasing that bear.
[10:50.250 --> 10:51.370]  Why is there a bear?
[10:52.290 --> 10:53.350]  That's Andrew's guy.
[10:53.430 --> 10:55.090]  Are they fighting each other?
[10:55.230 --> 10:56.070]  Yeah, let's just watch.
[10:56.210 --> 10:56.950]  You get them to fight.
[10:57.250 --> 10:58.250]  Watch, observe.
[10:58.890 --> 10:59.370]  Awesome.
[11:01.290 --> 11:02.490]  What an opportunity to heal.
[11:03.110 --> 11:03.490]  Bam.
[11:03.890 --> 11:04.710]  124 damage?
[11:04.890 --> 11:05.590]  Holy shit.
[11:05.970 --> 11:06.430]  I'm getting in.
[11:06.490 --> 11:07.990]  I'm going to fight this fucking bear too.
[11:08.350 --> 11:08.670]  Why?
[11:08.970 --> 11:10.290]  No, you fool.
[11:10.550 --> 11:12.010]  Because we can get more parts.
[11:12.070 --> 11:14.270]  If we kill the bear as well, we get additional resources.
[11:14.310 --> 11:15.690]  Let them hurt each other first.
[11:15.730 --> 11:16.250]  Let's cut the bear's arm off.
[11:17.770 --> 11:18.170]  Get in.
[11:18.170 --> 11:19.170]  Get in on this bear.
[11:26.070 --> 11:28.630]  Oh no, Andrew's in the middle of them.
[11:29.670 --> 11:30.450]  He's kicking them.
[11:30.670 --> 11:31.850]  Oh shit, it's getting away.
[11:32.090 --> 11:32.430]  It's getting away.
[11:34.130 --> 11:35.050]  No, the bear.
[11:35.050 --> 11:35.950]  You guys got to get out of here.
[11:35.990 --> 11:37.270]  The other monster is getting away.
[11:37.530 --> 11:38.530]  Okay, let's get the other one.
[11:38.630 --> 11:39.590]  Okay, go.
[11:39.750 --> 11:40.850]  Go chase the other monster.
[11:41.250 --> 11:42.090]  Chocobo, to me.
[11:42.470 --> 11:42.830]  Thank you.
[11:43.930 --> 11:44.870]  Oh, he's chasing him too.
[11:44.930 --> 11:46.070]  He wants more of that action.
[11:46.630 --> 11:46.950]  Go get him.
[11:46.950 --> 11:47.630]  I think he wants us.
[11:47.990 --> 11:48.530]  Holy shit.
[11:48.530 --> 11:49.250]  Is he behind us?
[11:49.910 --> 11:50.930]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[11:52.650 --> 11:53.570]  Oh my god.
[11:53.870 --> 11:54.750]  Guys, I'll be honest.
[11:54.890 --> 11:57.530]  I don't know how to fire my fucking gun.
[11:57.570 --> 11:58.090]  I'm on him.
[11:58.310 --> 11:58.990]  I'm on him.
[11:59.930 --> 12:00.730]  Get him.
[12:01.170 --> 12:02.030]  I'm on him.
[12:03.530 --> 12:04.150]  Break him.
[12:05.010 --> 12:05.950]  Keep doing it.
[12:05.990 --> 12:06.390]  There we go.
[12:06.450 --> 12:06.890]  There we go.
[12:06.950 --> 12:08.790]  Oh, I'm getting fucking fucked up.
[12:08.990 --> 12:10.130]  Nick, you're fucking him up, man.
[12:10.570 --> 12:11.670]  He's fucking me up.
[12:15.290 --> 12:16.230]  How'd you do that?
[12:16.270 --> 12:16.910]  That was awesome.
[12:17.190 --> 12:18.950]  I jumped off him from the Chocobo.
[12:19.150 --> 12:19.750]  Do it again.
[12:21.170 --> 12:23.730]  Yeah, Nick said he couldn't jump, and then he pulled off the coolest jump ever.
[12:23.910 --> 12:24.770]  Yeah, that was sick.
[12:24.830 --> 12:25.370]  You know what?
[12:25.410 --> 12:26.090]  I take it back.
[12:34.610 --> 12:35.730]  Andrew's still fighting the bear.
[12:36.070 --> 12:37.650]  I'm locked in on this bear.
[12:37.770 --> 12:38.970]  This bear ain't escaping.
[12:39.770 --> 12:40.490]  Eat horn.
[12:42.170 --> 12:44.290]  Okay, the bear may escape.
[12:44.710 --> 12:45.390]  The bear may escape.
[12:45.750 --> 12:46.450]  Get me out of here.
[12:46.830 --> 12:47.410]  Get me out of here.
[12:47.430 --> 12:48.970]  It's time for the big fuck-off axe.
[12:48.970 --> 12:50.990]  This asshole's not gonna...
[12:50.990 --> 12:52.070]  I did an echo bubble.
[12:53.650 --> 12:54.250]  Hell yeah.
[12:55.570 --> 12:57.050]  Nick, you gotta jump on his back again.
[12:58.270 --> 12:58.630]  Okay.
[13:00.030 --> 13:00.590]  He's down.
[13:00.670 --> 13:01.150]  Beat him up.
[13:01.750 --> 13:02.630]  Oh, fuck him up.
[13:10.090 --> 13:11.190]  All right, do it, Nick.
[13:12.110 --> 13:12.830]  Oh, I missed.
[13:13.510 --> 13:14.230]  Wound destroyed.
[13:14.350 --> 13:15.530]  We destroyed a wound, whatever that is.
[13:15.530 --> 13:15.950]  Hell yeah.
[13:16.830 --> 13:18.030]  Oh, I think I just shot someone's horse.
[13:18.050 --> 13:18.690]  He's getting away.
[13:19.590 --> 13:20.650]  Oh, he ain't going far.
[13:20.710 --> 13:20.970]  Look at him.
[13:21.110 --> 13:21.670]  No mercy.
[13:21.850 --> 13:22.750]  He can barely walk.
[13:22.750 --> 13:22.910]  To me.
[13:26.230 --> 13:26.850]  Get him, Nick.
[13:27.830 --> 13:28.590]  I'm waiting for him.
[13:28.670 --> 13:29.870]  He's coming back to the bear lane.
[13:30.070 --> 13:31.150]  He's coming to the bear lane.
[13:31.190 --> 13:32.050]  He's got no chance.
[13:32.310 --> 13:33.110]  The bear lane.
[13:33.130 --> 13:33.950]  Oh, the bear's here.
[13:33.990 --> 13:34.850]  Oh, the bear's there.
[13:35.610 --> 13:36.590]  Oh, watch for the bear.
[13:37.250 --> 13:40.230]  Oh, no, I'm down.
[13:40.530 --> 13:41.230]  Oh, damn.
[13:41.890 --> 13:42.870]  You got down by the bear?
[13:43.310 --> 13:44.210]  Bear killed me.
[13:44.390 --> 13:46.010]  Can I stay on my horse?
[13:46.670 --> 13:46.890]  Yeah.
[13:46.890 --> 13:49.570]  But you can also jump off onto his back, I think.
[13:49.950 --> 13:50.650]  How do I do that?
[13:50.650 --> 13:50.790]  Be careful.
[13:50.930 --> 13:51.830]  I think we might have lives.
[13:52.070 --> 13:52.270]  Nick did it.
[13:52.310 --> 13:53.350]  It was sick as hell.
[13:54.990 --> 13:56.490]  I just, yeah, I just ran past him.
[13:56.590 --> 13:57.750]  And oh, Gavin got knocked off.
[13:59.530 --> 14:00.750]  This is not coming back.
[14:01.150 --> 14:01.610]  Echo bubble.
[14:02.470 --> 14:03.770]  Oh, this might be it.
[14:03.770 --> 14:04.370]  He might be down.
[14:04.770 --> 14:05.390]  You got him.
[14:07.270 --> 14:08.070]  The bear!
[14:09.650 --> 14:13.190]  Okay, make sure you start taking parts off of the thing you killed.
[14:13.910 --> 14:14.410]  Got it.
[14:14.530 --> 14:15.030]  Scrapping them.
[14:16.270 --> 14:17.270]  Watch out for the bear.
[14:17.490 --> 14:17.870]  Oh, bear.
[14:17.870 --> 14:18.470]  How do you do that?
[14:19.030 --> 14:19.570]  Kill the bear.
[14:19.990 --> 14:20.310]  Press B next to the monster.
[14:20.310 --> 14:22.390]  Walk up to the body and push B.
[14:23.050 --> 14:23.730]  The timer.
[14:23.930 --> 14:25.530]  What about the goddamn bear?
[14:25.870 --> 14:28.470]  Well, Andrew did that, so you figure it out.
[14:29.570 --> 14:30.730]  How do I ride the bear?
[14:31.550 --> 14:33.470]  No, I want to get on the carcass.
[14:33.590 --> 14:34.390]  I need to harvest.
[14:34.730 --> 14:35.530]  Keep harvesting.
[14:36.870 --> 14:38.210]  I can't, the bear.
[14:39.510 --> 14:40.410]  Okay, I'm helping.
[14:40.550 --> 14:41.450]  I'm focusing in on the bear.
[14:41.590 --> 14:41.850]  There you go.
[14:42.010 --> 14:42.350]  Shit.
[14:42.570 --> 14:43.850]  I shoved my sacks up his ass.
[14:44.650 --> 14:45.870]  Nabra, make sure you harvest.
[14:46.130 --> 14:46.350]  You need...
[14:46.350 --> 14:46.850]  Okay, he's leaving.
[14:47.150 --> 14:47.770]  The bear's leaving.
[14:48.010 --> 14:48.330]  Awesome.
[14:48.510 --> 14:49.230]  All right, then we'll kill the bear.
[14:49.310 --> 14:50.010]  Let's kill the bear next.
[14:50.250 --> 14:52.210]  Well, we were going to end the quest and then we could...
[14:53.190 --> 14:55.150]  The bear is just a random monster in the instance.
[14:55.410 --> 14:55.890]  Well, we'll get one.
[14:56.010 --> 14:57.110]  Yeah, but it's a big-ass monster.
[14:57.170 --> 14:57.570]  Let's kill it.
[14:58.010 --> 14:59.230]  We have 10 seconds, Nick.
[14:59.230 --> 15:01.270]  I don't know if we're going to be able to accomplish that, but I like your energy.
[15:01.450 --> 15:02.370]  You can do it in 10 seconds.
[15:03.550 --> 15:04.690]  I'm writing in my book.
[15:06.130 --> 15:06.770]  Quest complete.
[15:07.190 --> 15:08.950]  Watch Nick ride bear.
[15:10.950 --> 15:13.390]  That was a textbook ass-whooping.
[15:13.850 --> 15:15.870]  Well, once we figured it out, it got really fun.
[15:16.390 --> 15:17.450]  Yeah, these games are great.
[15:17.570 --> 15:21.130]  It's just figuring out how to play with each other is always the thing.
[15:21.310 --> 15:23.050]  Oh, I love playing with each other.
[15:25.410 --> 15:27.110]  Ah, it was a sex thing you said.
[15:27.630 --> 15:29.250]  It was a joke that you made.
[15:29.930 --> 15:30.290]  Yeah, I did.
[15:31.250 --> 15:32.370]  The entire way through.
[15:32.590 --> 15:33.110]  It was all you.
[15:33.610 --> 15:34.010]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:35.450 --> 15:36.130]  Rode the wave.
[15:36.370 --> 15:36.590]  Anyway.
[15:37.110 --> 15:38.250]  Messing with my partner.
[15:39.030 --> 15:43.030]  So now we need someone to...
[15:43.030 --> 15:45.130]  I think, Geoff, maybe you post another quest.
[15:45.710 --> 15:46.750]  Why do I have to do it?
[15:46.930 --> 15:48.030]  Because you did it last time.
[15:48.490 --> 15:48.890]  I'll do it.
[15:49.130 --> 15:50.310]  I don't remember doing it, but I'll do it.
[15:50.850 --> 15:51.210]  All right.
[15:51.930 --> 15:54.750]  You can access quest counter at your tent by talking to your handler.
[15:54.930 --> 15:56.190]  That's what I'm doing right now, asshole.
[16:00.770 --> 16:02.430]  Now you can view the cutscenes you skipped.
[16:03.590 --> 16:03.910]  Sweet.
[16:04.520 --> 16:05.960]  Do you guys want to...
[16:07.110 --> 16:12.710]  I can pick fire starter, which is to find a fire monster.
[16:13.070 --> 16:19.110]  I can pick beware of the frog, giant frog or bug in the desert.
[16:19.630 --> 16:20.050]  Fire starter.
[16:20.230 --> 16:20.650]  That's the one.
[16:21.090 --> 16:22.030]  Oh, details.
[16:23.210 --> 16:23.490]  Accept.
[16:24.270 --> 16:25.750]  Guys, I think we might be playing the game now.
[16:26.150 --> 16:26.310]  Yep.
[16:28.150 --> 16:30.330]  Holy shit, it might actually be happening.
[16:31.730 --> 16:32.490]  Let's play!
[16:33.910 --> 16:35.150]  I don't think we can say that.
[16:36.050 --> 16:37.110]  No, we don't own that one.
[16:37.990 --> 16:38.810]  Bernie's gonna see this.
[16:38.810 --> 16:39.170]  Let's go!
[16:41.690 --> 16:43.070]  Did you hear what they said?
[16:45.770 --> 16:46.130]  Gameplay.
[16:46.910 --> 16:50.490]  You have joined baby Pepsi's quest.
[16:51.970 --> 16:53.290]  No, bro, there you are.
[16:53.410 --> 16:53.930]  What's up, dude?
[16:54.410 --> 16:56.670]  I think Geoff started the quest and he just went like,
[16:56.690 --> 16:58.230]  I'm not waiting for these fuckers, let's go.
[16:58.310 --> 16:59.150]  And he's like running out there.
[16:59.190 --> 17:00.230]  It just auto runs.
[17:00.350 --> 17:01.850]  I'm not even using my controller.
[17:02.530 --> 17:03.250]  You're using the car?
[17:03.250 --> 17:04.590]  The horse or what?
[17:04.990 --> 17:05.530]  The car.
[17:07.250 --> 17:08.990]  I'm using the monster car, yeah.
[17:09.110 --> 17:11.530]  I think this is the same monster you guys killed already.
[17:11.810 --> 17:12.170]  Cool!
[17:12.350 --> 17:13.590]  Oh, it is. It's the exact same one.
[17:13.710 --> 17:17.530]  That's why I considered you three options and you guys went, yeah, over and over again.
[17:19.810 --> 17:21.830]  We get materials for doing this.
[17:22.010 --> 17:22.890]  Like, it's the...
[17:22.890 --> 17:24.310]  Yeah, Geoff, think about the materials.
[17:24.790 --> 17:25.670]  Geoff, that's how you upgrade.
[17:25.790 --> 17:26.430]  That's how you progress.
[17:26.730 --> 17:28.870]  Geoff, you have to think about the long term.
[17:28.950 --> 17:30.230]  Yeah, but we could have killed the frog.
[17:30.870 --> 17:31.930]  The loop of the game.
[17:32.810 --> 17:33.870]  Jump on his back.
[17:34.150 --> 17:34.710]  Nick, dude.
[17:34.910 --> 17:37.690]  Nick, the whole time you're doing this, you should be trying to jump on his back.
[17:37.930 --> 17:39.150]  You're right. I'll work on that.
[17:39.670 --> 17:42.670]  Like, that could be the cool moment for this fight.
[17:43.590 --> 17:45.210]  I feel like that wood should have cut its tail off.
[17:47.030 --> 17:49.630]  Hit him in the forehead with a sword.
[17:49.750 --> 17:50.570]  And he's like, ow.
[17:53.210 --> 17:58.290]  I think this would be like if a cat had like a butter knife.
[17:58.290 --> 17:59.710]  It was like hitting you with a butter knife.
[17:59.710 --> 18:02.870]  Like, size-wise, I think that's how it kind of like chalks out.
[18:03.910 --> 18:04.850]  And armor-wise?
[18:05.150 --> 18:09.290]  Yeah, like a cat with a butter knife isn't gonna like beat you the fuck up.
[18:09.430 --> 18:10.930]  Four cats with butter knives, you'd be like...
[18:10.930 --> 18:12.270]  Eventually, you'd get so exhausted.
[18:13.490 --> 18:14.250]  I don't know, man.
[18:15.490 --> 18:17.170]  And I think it'd be more like a cat with a steak.
[18:19.150 --> 18:22.150]  Because I think there's so much armor on this thing.
[18:22.610 --> 18:23.950]  Like, I think he's like thick skin.
[18:25.210 --> 18:26.890]  Yeah, I called him names earlier.
[18:27.690 --> 18:28.330]  It's true.
[18:28.330 --> 18:31.410]  Nick was really... he got really personal with it.
[18:31.570 --> 18:32.870]  Yeah, he was being very rude.
[18:34.330 --> 18:36.730]  Dude, that fast sword thing, like that rocks, Nick.
[18:36.750 --> 18:37.850]  Shit, isn't that great?
[18:38.130 --> 18:38.970]  You know what doesn't rock?
[18:38.970 --> 18:40.770]  This fucking slow-ass greatsword.
[18:41.110 --> 18:43.490]  Yeah, I think the greatsword is the worst weapon in the game.
[18:43.850 --> 18:44.610]  Yeah, I agree.
[18:45.050 --> 18:46.450]  I think Mark the Frog might have screwed me on this.
[18:47.350 --> 18:51.270]  Dude, if you're out here listening to Mark the Frog, you're already behind the eight ball.
[18:52.030 --> 18:53.070]  He said he knew the game.
[18:54.290 --> 18:56.090]  I keep thumping the ground with my sacks.
[18:58.370 --> 18:59.630]  You have multiple sacks?
[18:59.750 --> 19:00.570]  Oh, you're saxophone.
[19:03.610 --> 19:04.550]  Broke his tail.
[19:05.070 --> 19:05.630]  Wound destroyed.
[19:05.990 --> 19:06.330]  Nice.
[19:08.090 --> 19:11.250]  Got quadraphony or some sort of a Who album, I think it's called.
[19:13.350 --> 19:14.870]  I really wanna know.
[19:15.410 --> 19:15.950]  Encore.
[19:21.070 --> 19:21.850]  Oh, shit.
[19:22.670 --> 19:23.370]  I gotta heal.
[19:23.850 --> 19:24.810]  I gotta heal real bad.
[19:25.550 --> 19:26.130]  What do I heal?
[19:26.690 --> 19:27.030]  Drinky, drinky.
[19:27.030 --> 19:28.770]  Pepsi said nice to meet you.
[19:29.310 --> 19:30.030]  I'm doing it again.
[19:30.370 --> 19:32.350]  I'm a quad for my friends, but I'm not healing.
[19:32.710 --> 19:33.670]  How do I get out of that?
[19:33.870 --> 19:34.030]  Oh, wait.
[19:34.370 --> 19:34.830]  To me.
[19:35.650 --> 19:36.370]  Baby Pepsi.
[19:36.850 --> 19:37.210]  Okay.
[19:40.630 --> 19:41.890]  All right, let's see if I can get on this bitch.
[19:41.910 --> 19:42.710]  Babe, I got my fishing rod.
[19:42.870 --> 19:43.290]  God damn it.
[19:43.350 --> 19:43.570]  Jump.
[19:44.550 --> 19:45.050]  Nice, Nick.
[19:45.070 --> 19:45.670]  I'm on him.
[19:45.870 --> 19:46.570]  I'm on him.
[19:47.150 --> 19:48.050]  I did it.
[19:50.370 --> 19:51.070]  Stabby, stabby.
[19:51.130 --> 19:52.030]  I'm gonna play my horn.
[19:55.710 --> 19:57.410]  Oh, he's all mad.
[19:59.110 --> 20:01.710]  Why am I doing such shit damage now?
[20:01.830 --> 20:02.450]  Stabbing his back.
[20:03.810 --> 20:05.030]  You know what, dude?
[20:05.070 --> 20:06.990]  I bet your weapon is dull.
[20:06.990 --> 20:07.970]  I told you it's cool.
[20:08.070 --> 20:09.250]  I told you that's cool, Nick.
[20:09.350 --> 20:09.690]  Look at that.
[20:09.770 --> 20:10.130]  Achievement!
[20:10.170 --> 20:11.550]  And you got an Achievo, bro.
[20:12.010 --> 20:13.050]  Welcome to Achievement Hunter.
[20:13.250 --> 20:13.630]  I got a whetstone.
[20:13.790 --> 20:16.130]  You gotta... yeah, you gotta sharpen your...
[20:16.830 --> 20:17.830]  Sharpening my sacks.
[20:18.450 --> 20:19.410]  You gotta sharpen your...
[20:19.410 --> 20:20.770]  You got a dull saxophone.
[20:21.090 --> 20:21.270]  Yeah.
[20:24.270 --> 20:25.690]  You gotta play some sharps.
[20:25.710 --> 20:26.390]  You're only playing flats.
[20:33.060 --> 20:33.380]  Encore.
[20:34.080 --> 20:34.640]  He's running.
[20:35.000 --> 20:35.480]  Where are you going?
[20:35.480 --> 20:35.980]  Get that fool.
[20:37.380 --> 20:38.600]  He's gonna take us to the bear.
[20:39.080 --> 20:39.780]  Get me, birdie boy.
[20:40.540 --> 20:41.680]  Not the bear again.
[20:42.540 --> 20:43.580]  God, he is gonna take us to the bear.
[20:43.580 --> 20:44.760]  All right, Knobrott, let's do this.
[20:45.260 --> 20:45.720]  Let's do it.
[20:45.820 --> 20:46.700]  It's Knobrott and Gobbler.
[20:48.700 --> 20:50.240]  I hope Garfield 2 is okay.
[20:54.420 --> 20:55.920]  Oh, somebody can jump on his back.
[20:56.640 --> 20:57.240]  I don't know how to do it.
[20:57.240 --> 20:57.620]  I told you it's so cool.
[20:57.660 --> 20:58.360]  It's cool when it happens.
[20:58.460 --> 20:59.960]  You have to be on your chocobo or whatever.
[21:00.220 --> 21:00.580]  Oh, it didn't work.
[21:01.020 --> 21:02.460]  Yeah, it's awesome when it happens.
[21:02.460 --> 21:02.640]  It's down.
[21:04.560 --> 21:06.420]  Keep chunking, keep chunking, keep chunking.
[21:08.360 --> 21:09.960]  Oh, right to his head.
[21:10.060 --> 21:10.640]  Get the wound.
[21:10.880 --> 21:12.280]  Get the wound on his back.
[21:15.580 --> 21:16.880]  The glowing red spot.
[21:19.120 --> 21:19.960]  It's his weakness.
[21:25.960 --> 21:27.660]  Yeah, he's weakest in his weak spot.
[21:29.240 --> 21:30.360]  I would have never guessed.
[21:31.800 --> 21:33.360]  Okay, I'm trying to bring in another monster.
[21:34.680 --> 21:36.000]  All right, a specialty.
[21:36.620 --> 21:37.260]  Excuse me?
[21:38.100 --> 21:38.600]  Oh, it's dead.
[21:38.600 --> 21:39.100]  Can I get the bear?
[21:41.020 --> 21:41.380]  Deal.
[21:42.620 --> 21:43.680]  How do I name the car?
[21:48.120 --> 21:49.460]  What would you want to name your car?
[21:50.060 --> 21:50.400]  Wheels.
[21:51.260 --> 21:52.060]  No, call him cum car.
[21:54.860 --> 21:55.700]  The silent W.
[21:57.740 --> 21:59.800]  Oh, Nick, you are going to town on him, son.
[21:59.840 --> 22:02.580]  Oh, I'm messing this chicken up.
[22:02.720 --> 22:05.080]  He is going to regret pissing you off.
[22:06.020 --> 22:09.000]  This is what he gets for merely existing in this world.
[22:09.200 --> 22:10.240]  Merely existing.
[22:10.640 --> 22:12.400]  Ha, you fool, you merely exist here.
[22:12.800 --> 22:13.580]  We'll show you.
[22:13.880 --> 22:14.640]  Gang up on him.
[22:15.120 --> 22:16.080]  Fuck him up, fuck him up.
[22:16.560 --> 22:17.420]  Get him, get him, get him.
[22:21.220 --> 22:22.560]  Oh, tail is off.
[22:22.760 --> 22:23.160]  Tail broke.
[22:24.320 --> 22:25.440]  We can eat it like a placenta.
[22:25.600 --> 22:26.660]  Harvest it for goods.
[22:26.920 --> 22:27.760]  What the fuck?
[22:38.380 --> 22:40.300]  Oh, man, you just see the inside.
[22:41.100 --> 22:42.440]  It's nasty with his tail.
[22:42.720 --> 22:44.000]  Stick your sword in there, man.
[22:44.280 --> 22:45.060]  I'm trying to climb in.
[22:45.180 --> 22:47.020]  Put a finger in there, kind of just wiggle it around.
[22:47.300 --> 22:49.280]  Yeah, I'm trying to play a song into it.
[22:49.480 --> 22:50.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, play a song into it.
[22:50.720 --> 22:51.260]  Do them.
[22:53.640 --> 22:54.600]  Yeah, we got him.
[22:55.080 --> 22:57.820]  Oh, dude, I think you guys are masters at this.
[22:57.880 --> 22:59.120]  I think you got to take on a different animal.
[22:59.540 --> 23:00.520]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[23:00.980 --> 23:02.540]  What if we do the same one again?
[23:05.040 --> 23:07.120]  Hurry, hurry, harvest his bones.
[23:07.660 --> 23:10.940]  In the cutscene of him dying, I was just hopping around playing the song.
[23:13.620 --> 23:15.260]  Harvest the bones.
[23:15.660 --> 23:17.060]  Never gonna dance again.
[23:17.080 --> 23:18.020]  Got everything I need.
[23:18.420 --> 23:18.820]  Cool.
[23:19.740 --> 23:21.660]  You can harvest the tail too, right?
[23:23.840 --> 23:24.920]  Harvest the bone pile.
[23:26.920 --> 23:28.960]  Yeah, there it is.
[23:29.060 --> 23:30.220]  Yeah, you got to kill the frog next.
[23:32.060 --> 23:34.540]  His name's like Chupacabra, but not Chupacabra.
[23:34.600 --> 23:35.260]  It's messed up.
[23:35.840 --> 23:36.580]  Frog, frog, frog.
[23:38.920 --> 23:41.320]  Yeah, let me look at Nobrot while I'm over here.
[23:42.060 --> 23:42.520]  Oh, nice.
[23:44.280 --> 23:45.820]  Oh, you're missing an eye?
[23:46.840 --> 23:48.780]  No, it's just a different color.
[23:49.600 --> 23:51.080]  Nick, did you get everything in the tail also?
[23:51.960 --> 23:52.480]  I think so.
[23:52.640 --> 23:53.600]  Just some heterochromia.
[23:53.660 --> 23:54.140]  Now we'll never know.
[23:55.620 --> 23:56.680]  I wrote in my book.
[23:56.840 --> 23:57.660]  Write in da book.
[23:58.380 --> 24:00.120]  Nick Road Bird.
[24:02.980 --> 24:03.680]  Take all.
[24:04.140 --> 24:05.100]  All right, let's kill the frog.
[24:05.560 --> 24:06.200]  Kill the frog!
[24:06.200 --> 24:07.660]  Kill the frog.
[24:07.760 --> 24:08.160]  No mercy.
[24:08.280 --> 24:08.960]  Kill the frog.
[24:09.260 --> 24:10.380]  Kill the frog.
[24:11.120 --> 24:12.040]  This is the weapon tree.
[24:12.600 --> 24:14.020]  Go to hell, weapon tree.
[24:14.160 --> 24:14.800]  We want to see.
[24:15.100 --> 24:17.080]  Oh, yeah, you could switch off your stupid sword.
[24:20.140 --> 24:21.940]  Uh, forge list.
[24:22.220 --> 24:23.120]  What does that mean?
[24:24.260 --> 24:24.860]  It means forge.
[24:25.200 --> 24:27.040]  Can I make a new sword that's better?
[24:28.140 --> 24:29.760]  Quadra metrapiece of Adelita.
[24:30.740 --> 24:32.740]  What is the difference between these two things?
[24:34.900 --> 24:35.380]  Nothing.
[24:35.380 --> 24:37.200]  All right, it doesn't seem like I can do shit.
[24:37.700 --> 24:41.380]  I think what you can do is start that mission where you beat the fuck out of that frog, baby.
[24:41.780 --> 24:42.500]  Yeah, let's kill the frog.
[24:42.580 --> 24:43.100]  All right, let's do it.
[24:43.480 --> 24:45.680]  Oh, how do you sharpen your weapons back?
[24:45.780 --> 24:46.680]  Oh, that's a great.
[24:46.880 --> 24:47.580]  It's a great question.
[24:48.000 --> 24:48.940]  I think you use a whetstone.
[24:48.980 --> 24:50.100]  Yeah, you got something to do.
[24:50.860 --> 24:52.380]  Oh, yeah, but it's in your inventory.
[24:52.520 --> 24:53.380]  You can just toggle that.
[24:53.460 --> 24:54.800]  Like, oh, you don't like talk to someone about it.
[24:54.820 --> 24:55.280]  You just like.
[24:55.640 --> 24:57.320]  Nope, you just do it.
[24:58.140 --> 25:01.580]  Uh, left bumper and then up on the left.
[25:01.680 --> 25:02.680]  Back to the right stick.
[25:04.700 --> 25:07.920]  As long as you're under action, a whetstone should be set there.
[25:07.980 --> 25:08.740]  Oh, cool.
[25:09.300 --> 25:12.700]  Uh, you see the top left of the like weapon symbol?
[25:13.520 --> 25:13.580]  Yeah.
[25:13.760 --> 25:14.580]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:14.620 --> 25:15.000]  OK, cool.
[25:15.160 --> 25:17.340]  That's when you know when to reuse it.
[25:17.620 --> 25:18.820]  OK, OK, OK, OK.
[25:19.040 --> 25:21.980]  All right, Geoff, start the start the start the frog killing mission.
[25:22.720 --> 25:23.240]  Hey, Pepsi.
[25:24.620 --> 25:27.000]  Hey, well, I think we're got everybody to go.
[25:27.380 --> 25:27.920]  All right, let's go.
[25:28.380 --> 25:29.660]  Everyone jump on your dinosaurs.
[25:30.720 --> 25:32.940]  Dino, we got the squad going.
[25:33.340 --> 25:36.720]  All right, guys, this is the dangerous Chattacobra.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.220]  The longest tongue in the land.
[25:39.500 --> 25:43.160]  You have to be aware of his long tongue and how he is a frog.
[25:44.140 --> 25:45.000]  No, what the?
[25:46.220 --> 25:46.700]  Wow.
[25:47.200 --> 25:49.760]  Oh, I'm running a different way.
[25:49.960 --> 25:50.080]  What?
[25:50.380 --> 25:50.960]  I don't know.
[25:51.180 --> 25:52.160]  The hell is going on?
[25:53.200 --> 25:54.640]  Everybody went different directions.
[25:54.960 --> 25:55.720]  What is going on?
[25:56.180 --> 25:56.960]  What the fuck?
[25:57.740 --> 25:58.720]  Geoff, where are you going?
[25:58.720 --> 25:59.860]  I don't know, dude.
[25:59.920 --> 26:01.100]  He's just fucking going.
[26:04.140 --> 26:07.640]  Oh, he's got that big slop tongue stabbing frog butt.
[26:07.980 --> 26:09.300]  Everyone's over at the frog, Geoff.
[26:09.360 --> 26:10.140]  You got to get to the frog.
[26:10.540 --> 26:12.220]  I'm fucking working on it.
[26:13.340 --> 26:13.660]  Shit.
[26:14.360 --> 26:16.140]  My Chattacobra had a mind of his own.
[26:16.400 --> 26:18.480]  Yeah, you should jump on the back of the frog.
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.460]  I don't know if we can do that the same way we did the other guy.
[26:21.560 --> 26:23.440]  But maybe if I don't listen to this guy, jump on his back.
[26:23.440 --> 26:24.160]  What's the jump button?
[26:25.000 --> 26:25.600]  There's not one.
[26:25.760 --> 26:26.520]  You have to get on the Chocobo.
[26:26.760 --> 26:27.560]  He's on the Chocobo.
[26:27.620 --> 26:27.920]  Now what?
[26:29.280 --> 26:30.440]  Press A, I think.
[26:30.680 --> 26:31.380]  I'm pressing A.
[26:31.380 --> 26:31.840]  When you're near its back.
[26:32.080 --> 26:32.580]  Oh, it didn't do nothing.
[26:34.380 --> 26:35.980]  This bitch is gonna get fucking...
[26:35.980 --> 26:37.860]  Oh, we're already cracking him.
[26:38.080 --> 26:38.820]  We're cracking him.
[26:39.020 --> 26:39.680]  Get him, get him.
[26:39.740 --> 26:40.340]  He's knocked over.
[26:40.440 --> 26:41.580]  Get him, get him.
[26:42.200 --> 26:43.780]  Oh, oh, look, he's got a wound.
[26:44.140 --> 26:44.700]  He's got a wound.
[26:45.040 --> 26:45.340]  Go get him.
[26:45.980 --> 26:47.180]  Mess his wound up.
[26:47.980 --> 26:49.140]  Quick, pick at the sore.
[26:49.540 --> 26:50.680]  We broke his leg.
[26:51.560 --> 26:51.960]  Ow.
[26:52.260 --> 26:53.560]  Oh, this is brutal.
[26:53.880 --> 26:54.940]  He doesn't stand a chance.
[26:55.140 --> 26:56.640]  You're not supposed to pick scabs, fool.
[26:56.640 --> 26:59.100]  You just had to take a stab.
[26:59.460 --> 26:59.800]  Ow!
[27:00.260 --> 27:01.080]  There's bugs here.
[27:03.040 --> 27:03.520]  Ow.
[27:04.180 --> 27:05.060]  I deserve that one.
[27:10.370 --> 27:11.630]  Oh, he really doesn't like...
[27:11.630 --> 27:14.910]  Whatever you're popping down on the floor, he does not like that.
[27:15.370 --> 27:16.950]  His left leg is broken now.
[27:17.330 --> 27:19.590]  Oh, I won 49 on that hit, dude.
[27:19.650 --> 27:20.190]  That was awesome.
[27:20.830 --> 27:21.630]  I'm putting Echobubbles.
[27:24.570 --> 27:25.890]  Oh, look out for his long tongue.
[27:28.270 --> 27:29.730]  Tongue can lick my ass.
[27:30.470 --> 27:31.430]  Yeah, it can.
[27:31.870 --> 27:33.190]  Oh, we're getting chunks.
[27:33.770 --> 27:34.690]  Come on, get on there.
[27:34.770 --> 27:35.050]  Get him.
[27:37.010 --> 27:37.790]  There you go.
[27:37.910 --> 27:39.350]  Oh, I think we're really fucking him up.
[27:40.350 --> 27:40.750]  Ouch.
[27:41.030 --> 27:43.070]  It looks like, uh...
[27:43.070 --> 27:44.610]  Whoa, 53.
[27:44.930 --> 27:46.030]  He's about to go down again.
[27:48.310 --> 27:49.110]  There you go.
[27:49.230 --> 27:50.130]  80 in the ass.
[27:51.130 --> 27:51.810]  Get him heavy stuff.
[27:51.830 --> 27:52.050]  Shit.
[27:52.550 --> 27:53.370]  You're cutting him up.
[27:56.510 --> 27:57.530]  There you go.
[27:58.450 --> 27:58.750]  Hit him.
[27:58.850 --> 27:59.250]  Boom.
[28:00.030 --> 28:03.010]  There he's going down.
[28:03.130 --> 28:03.850]  Oh, come on, boys.
[28:03.970 --> 28:05.530]  Oh, we're just breaking him.
[28:06.550 --> 28:08.370]  This is a lot easier with four of us.
[28:08.450 --> 28:08.850]  Encore.
[28:09.150 --> 28:10.270]  Yeah, there you go.
[28:10.790 --> 28:11.710]  No, the tongue.
[28:12.030 --> 28:13.530]  You got to look out for his tongue.
[28:15.290 --> 28:16.090]  Those Echobubbles.
[28:16.250 --> 28:17.330]  I don't know what they do.
[28:17.530 --> 28:18.550]  It seems to be working.
[28:18.970 --> 28:21.270]  I think they grant like a buff of some sort.
[28:21.850 --> 28:25.650]  Oh, look at this.
[28:25.870 --> 28:26.710]  Damn. Hell yeah.
[28:28.590 --> 28:30.270]  Oh, holy shit.
[28:30.570 --> 28:32.290]  Oh, 129.
[28:32.670 --> 28:33.230]  129.
[28:33.350 --> 28:34.190]  Oh, he's trying to run.
[28:34.450 --> 28:35.010]  He's limping.
[28:35.150 --> 28:36.070]  He's limping away.
[28:36.430 --> 28:37.470]  No freedom.
[28:37.950 --> 28:38.670]  No mercy.
[28:39.350 --> 28:41.410]  Get your Chocobo.
[28:42.090 --> 28:43.310]  I'm chasing him.
[28:43.670 --> 28:44.250]  No quarter.
[28:44.970 --> 28:45.910]  I'm sniffing his rect.
[28:46.350 --> 28:46.990]  Come on, Chocobo.
[28:49.930 --> 28:51.050]  Nick, jump on his back.
[28:51.410 --> 28:51.850]  Yes.
[28:52.390 --> 28:53.070]  Nick did it again.
[28:53.670 --> 28:54.390]  I got him.
[28:54.730 --> 28:55.330]  I got him.
[28:55.330 --> 28:57.170]  Keep stabbing him.
[28:57.430 --> 28:58.750]  Oh, you piss him right off.
[28:59.530 --> 29:01.450]  Oh, gotta move back on his back.
[29:02.190 --> 29:03.030]  There you go.
[29:03.230 --> 29:03.830]  Go back on the back.
[29:03.950 --> 29:04.090]  Okay.
[29:04.830 --> 29:05.770]  I'll stab him in the butt instead.
[29:05.890 --> 29:06.350]  There you go.
[29:07.350 --> 29:08.150]  Weapon attack.
[29:08.630 --> 29:09.610]  Brace. Hold on.
[29:10.510 --> 29:11.130]  Draw finisher.
[29:11.290 --> 29:11.770]  Right bumper.
[29:13.130 --> 29:14.170]  You're finishing him?
[29:14.390 --> 29:15.470]  You're putting on a finishing move?
[29:15.750 --> 29:15.930]  Boom!
[29:15.930 --> 29:16.730]  Oh, look at this.
[29:16.870 --> 29:17.810]  Look at this.
[29:18.110 --> 29:22.690]  Oh my god, dude.
[29:22.890 --> 29:24.110]  That was cool as shit.
[29:24.610 --> 29:25.570]  I'm telling you, man.
[29:25.570 --> 29:27.070]  Jumping on his back is the way to do it.
[29:27.070 --> 29:27.730]  Oh, you did it.
[29:27.810 --> 29:28.470]  Oh, he's dead.
[29:28.710 --> 29:29.710]  He's down.
[29:29.890 --> 29:30.410]  He's down.
[29:31.790 --> 29:33.270]  Dude, Nick is MVP.
[29:33.830 --> 29:35.230]  Nick is MVP at Monster Hunter.
[29:36.170 --> 29:37.130]  Dibs on the tongue.
[29:37.270 --> 29:38.110]  Got me some bones.
[29:39.710 --> 29:40.470]  Carcass this guy.
[29:40.890 --> 29:41.490]  Everyone get it?
[29:41.730 --> 29:42.510]  That's all the carcass.
[29:43.810 --> 29:44.170]  Nice.
[29:44.470 --> 29:44.810]  Good to go.
[29:45.530 --> 29:46.170]  That was great.
[29:46.290 --> 29:46.990]  You guys need to...
[29:46.990 --> 29:49.290]  I think there's time to hunt one more monster.
[29:49.330 --> 29:50.090]  Yeah, let's get one more.
[29:50.110 --> 29:50.670]  Let's do it.
[29:50.670 --> 29:51.410]  We got one more to hunt.
[29:52.150 --> 29:52.770]  This is...
[29:52.770 --> 29:58.150]  When you get through all of the bullshit and you get to just fight monsters, this game rocks.
[29:58.730 --> 30:00.630]  Nick jumped on frog.
[30:06.030 --> 30:08.190]  I think the diary at the end is my favorite part.
[30:09.530 --> 30:11.690]  Just writing a story about my friend, Nick.
[30:12.230 --> 30:13.810]  Are you writing it from top down, though?
[30:17.910 --> 30:18.430]  Charcuterie?
[30:20.470 --> 30:20.990]  Charcuterie.
[30:22.770 --> 30:24.610]  Is there anything you guys want to try to upgrade?
[30:24.710 --> 30:25.590]  You want to just jump into it?
[30:26.530 --> 30:27.530]  I'm going to just jump in.
[30:27.610 --> 30:28.750]  I'm down to jump in.
[30:28.930 --> 30:30.650]  Feels like pros at this now, guys.
[30:31.190 --> 30:32.370]  Oh, we got it locked in.
[30:32.830 --> 30:36.090]  I really like the begin and end quest font and treatment.
[30:36.310 --> 30:37.250]  Yeah, it looks cool, right?
[30:37.470 --> 30:38.250]  It's very cool.
[30:38.790 --> 30:41.210]  Hey, by the way, I changed my gamer tag.
[30:41.650 --> 30:42.250]  Did you realize?
[30:45.230 --> 30:46.530]  Say hello to the mechanic.
[30:47.370 --> 30:48.230]  He's the mechanic.
[30:49.010 --> 30:49.230]  Yep.
[30:49.330 --> 30:50.090]  That's awesome.
[30:50.430 --> 30:51.490]  Cost me no money.
[30:51.490 --> 30:54.330]  I didn't try to go, but my horse did.
[30:54.770 --> 30:56.310]  It just took the fuck off.
[30:56.950 --> 30:57.250]  You going?
[30:57.470 --> 30:57.810]  Okay.
[30:58.290 --> 30:58.670]  Are we going?
[30:58.790 --> 30:59.390]  Oh, we're all here.
[30:59.610 --> 31:00.350]  Knobrod's here.
[31:00.930 --> 31:01.130]  Mechanic?
[31:01.650 --> 31:01.910]  Yep.
[31:02.070 --> 31:02.530]  Which way?
[31:02.710 --> 31:03.090]  Oh, there it is.
[31:03.110 --> 31:03.350]  Baby Pepsi.
[31:03.350 --> 31:04.930]  I'm just spinning around in circles waiting for you guys.
[31:06.230 --> 31:07.390]  I'm hopping over the...
[31:08.630 --> 31:09.070]  Jesus.
[31:09.670 --> 31:13.850]  Whenever I say mechanic, I feel like it's the same as when people call Mario, Mario.
[31:14.470 --> 31:16.430]  And it gives me joy.
[31:16.910 --> 31:17.750]  Is he not called Mario?
[31:18.350 --> 31:19.690]  No, he's Mario.
[31:21.490 --> 31:21.810]  Mario?
[31:22.730 --> 31:23.210]  Mario?
[31:23.510 --> 31:24.110]  What are we doing?
[31:24.810 --> 31:26.990]  Why is my car driving in a circle?
[31:27.810 --> 31:28.850]  Are we killing these things?
[31:29.390 --> 31:30.690]  Haven't learned the name.
[31:30.810 --> 31:32.530]  Oh, slay 12 of these guys.
[31:32.850 --> 31:33.150]  Oh.
[31:34.190 --> 31:34.850]  Do it.
[31:36.450 --> 31:38.090]  Oh, I'm falling down.
[31:39.970 --> 31:40.450]  Wallet.
[31:40.970 --> 31:41.390]  Whack.
[31:41.970 --> 31:42.730]  All right, last four.
[31:43.150 --> 31:43.610]  That's four.
[31:44.870 --> 31:45.350]  Easy.
[31:45.990 --> 31:49.150]  You know, we might be able to just free roam and find a monster to kill that's not even
[31:49.150 --> 31:49.930]  part of this mission.
[31:50.110 --> 31:50.330]  Yeah.
[31:50.710 --> 31:51.350]  And do that.
[31:51.410 --> 31:52.450]  You want to see if we can just ride around?
[31:52.590 --> 31:53.270]  We could do that.
[31:54.130 --> 31:56.450]  Yeah, we'll have to finish this real fast and then.
[31:57.550 --> 31:59.590]  Well, if we finish this, we'll go back.
[31:59.870 --> 32:00.430]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[32:00.470 --> 32:01.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:01.310 --> 32:02.550]  So we'll lead the way and we'll follow.
[32:03.410 --> 32:04.190]  Let's go this way.
[32:05.390 --> 32:06.130]  Where are you?
[32:08.810 --> 32:09.630]  Oh, you're up there.
[32:10.530 --> 32:13.430]  Yeah, I'm just going to pass the marker.
[32:14.410 --> 32:17.090]  Where do we go to go up?
[32:17.230 --> 32:17.830]  Oh, here we go.
[32:18.710 --> 32:19.170]  Here we go.
[32:19.210 --> 32:19.470]  Follow me.
[32:19.470 --> 32:20.330]  What'd you find?
[32:21.290 --> 32:22.890]  Uh, we got another frog situation.
[32:22.910 --> 32:24.150]  Oh my god, it's another frog?
[32:27.510 --> 32:28.030]  Get him.
[32:30.070 --> 32:30.990]  Kill the frog!
[32:32.010 --> 32:32.830]  I'm on him again!
[32:32.890 --> 32:33.990]  Nick's on him again!
[32:34.290 --> 32:35.810]  Nick is doing it, man.
[32:36.270 --> 32:37.710]  All right, Nick, keep messing him.
[32:37.790 --> 32:38.470]  Okay, hold the brace.
[32:38.870 --> 32:39.350]  Weapon attack.
[32:39.550 --> 32:40.010]  Keep doing it.
[32:40.030 --> 32:40.410]  Keep doing it.
[32:40.430 --> 32:41.050]  Keep cutting him up.
[32:41.090 --> 32:41.950]  Oh, he's stabbed him.
[32:41.950 --> 32:43.090]  Nick has found his game.
[32:43.250 --> 32:43.670]  Drop finisher.
[32:43.790 --> 32:44.550]  RB, RB, RB.
[32:45.090 --> 32:47.650]  Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[32:48.130 --> 32:48.970]  Maybe, maybe.
[32:48.970 --> 32:49.930]  Here you go.
[32:50.330 --> 32:51.090]  There we go.
[32:51.190 --> 32:51.370]  Yep.
[32:51.510 --> 32:52.330]  You're railing him.
[32:53.170 --> 32:54.910]  Oh my god, you're still...
[32:55.370 --> 32:56.750]  Holy shit, Nick.
[32:57.150 --> 32:57.630]  Yes!
[32:58.090 --> 32:59.070]  Oh my god.
[32:59.290 --> 33:00.630]  Nick's a monster.
[33:01.650 --> 33:03.990]  I've kind of figured things out.
[33:04.550 --> 33:05.750]  He's down, keep hitting him.
[33:06.210 --> 33:09.630]  We might accidentally complete this mission because they're just running into us.
[33:11.110 --> 33:12.710]  Nick, you gotta jump on his back again, dude.
[33:13.410 --> 33:13.730]  I'll try.
[33:19.610 --> 33:20.370]  To me!
[33:22.470 --> 33:23.450]  Don't lick me.
[33:23.850 --> 33:24.330]  Whoa!
[33:24.390 --> 33:24.890]  Oh, I missed on that.
[33:25.510 --> 33:25.950]  Is he running?
[33:26.350 --> 33:26.750]  Oh, look out!
[33:26.790 --> 33:27.430]  Nah, he came back.
[33:31.440 --> 33:31.920]  Ow.
[33:33.420 --> 33:33.900]  God.
[33:34.320 --> 33:35.180]  Pissed off frog.
[33:35.460 --> 33:35.860]  Whoa!
[33:38.720 --> 33:40.400]  Whoa, he like ate shit.
[33:40.800 --> 33:42.100]  Smashed his neck on the ground.
[33:43.540 --> 33:45.380]  Oh, his arm's weak, his arm's weak.
[33:47.500 --> 33:48.300]  Mom's spaghetti.
[33:50.260 --> 33:51.000]  That's legs.
[33:52.340 --> 33:52.780]  Cut through.
[33:56.820 --> 33:57.500]  Oh, tongue.
[34:00.780 --> 34:01.900]  His tongue is weak, too.
[34:01.980 --> 34:03.360]  I think we can cut his tongue off, maybe.
[34:03.660 --> 34:03.980]  Hell yeah.
[34:04.060 --> 34:05.880]  Let's cut off his tongue.
[34:07.220 --> 34:08.580]  I'm focusing on tongue.
[34:15.700 --> 34:17.260]  Oh, he's belly flopping.
[34:20.260 --> 34:21.060]  No mercy!
[34:23.400 --> 34:24.840]  Is it his leg, something?
[34:25.020 --> 34:25.900]  Yeah, his leg is all...
[34:28.500 --> 34:29.380]  There we go.
[34:30.260 --> 34:31.400]  Left foreskin broken.
[34:43.630 --> 34:46.350]  Oh, we're getting scales.
[34:52.720 --> 34:54.540]  Come on, get that tongue!
[34:55.740 --> 34:56.780]  Come on.
[34:59.360 --> 35:00.280]  There we go.
[35:01.460 --> 35:02.100]  That might be it.
[35:02.940 --> 35:03.400]  Is he down?
[35:04.280 --> 35:05.700]  No, it's just a good chunk.
[35:08.140 --> 35:08.660]  Oops.
[35:09.300 --> 35:09.660]  Oops.
[35:11.560 --> 35:13.080]  Oh no, we're at 11 to 12.
[35:13.220 --> 35:14.240]  Not the bugs, not the bugs.
[35:14.440 --> 35:15.560]  Oh, we killed the bugs!
[35:15.680 --> 35:17.900]  Hey, we got 60 seconds to kill this frog!
[35:18.000 --> 35:18.600]  Kill this frog!
[35:19.100 --> 35:20.120]  Kill the big guy!
[35:21.280 --> 35:22.820]  He's running, but he's weak.
[35:22.900 --> 35:23.360]  He's weak.
[35:23.440 --> 35:24.120]  The bitch is weak.
[35:24.140 --> 35:24.980]  Geoff, you gotta get him!
[35:26.280 --> 35:28.320]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[35:28.800 --> 35:30.140]  I will as soon as I get him!
[35:31.340 --> 35:32.060]  50 seconds!
[35:32.360 --> 35:32.840]  Get closer!
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.960]  Get closer!
[35:37.040 --> 35:38.600]  No, slow down!
[35:38.620 --> 35:38.980]  Yes!
[35:40.320 --> 35:41.060]  Oh no!
[35:42.440 --> 35:44.220]  Stop him, stop him, we gotta stop him!
[35:45.100 --> 35:46.180]  He's getting away!
[35:46.640 --> 35:47.320]  30 seconds!
[35:48.060 --> 35:48.640]  We got him!
[35:48.800 --> 35:49.200]  Yes!
[35:49.420 --> 35:49.880]  We got him!
[35:50.100 --> 35:51.700]  Wait, no, someone flashed him!
[35:53.480 --> 35:54.180]  Oh, damn!
[35:55.080 --> 35:56.200]  Come on, guys, 20 seconds!
[35:56.400 --> 35:57.140]  Come on, you can get him!
[35:57.380 --> 35:57.540]  Shit!
[35:57.780 --> 35:58.900]  We can get him, we can get him!
[35:59.300 --> 36:01.360]  Why is this clock moving so much faster than a real clock?
[36:01.940 --> 36:02.640]  20 seconds!
[36:02.720 --> 36:03.380]  Oh my god!
[36:03.700 --> 36:04.320]  10 seconds!
[36:05.960 --> 36:07.120]  Fuck, I missed!
[36:11.460 --> 36:12.360]  He's down, he's down!
[36:12.920 --> 36:14.000]  Kill him, kill him!
[36:14.020 --> 36:14.460]  No!
[36:16.600 --> 36:18.260]  Didn't kill frog!
[36:20.080 --> 36:21.360]  Frog lives.
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.320]  Uh, do you want to try one actual mission?
[36:25.360 --> 36:26.180]  That wasn't a mission?
[36:26.740 --> 36:28.020]  These are optional missions.
[36:28.760 --> 36:29.080]  Oh.
[36:30.100 --> 36:32.300]  Oh my god, Gavin.
[36:33.840 --> 36:34.740]  I do.
[36:35.080 --> 36:37.840]  Let's see if we can find 15 more minutes of funny out of this.
[36:37.980 --> 36:39.180]  Oh, a new bounty has been posted?
[36:39.360 --> 36:39.960]  Let's go look.
[36:40.700 --> 36:42.220]  Maybe go get that, maybe do that one.
[36:42.620 --> 36:44.160]  Yeah, bounty sounds good.
[36:44.760 --> 36:45.060]  Oh.
[36:45.440 --> 36:45.760]  Oh.
[36:46.540 --> 36:47.840]  Oh, we're in way too...
[36:47.840 --> 36:49.200]  Yeah, no, no, we're not ready for that.
[36:49.600 --> 36:51.200]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's give it a shot!
[36:52.300 --> 36:53.180]  What are we, three?
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.820]  Yeah, four of us can do it.
[36:56.300 --> 36:59.400]  I think, uh, I think that's it then, because I don't think you can do anything.
[36:59.640 --> 37:01.220]  Yeah, I think we gotta progress, maybe.
[37:01.820 --> 37:02.040]  Yep.
[37:02.420 --> 37:03.580]  What would that be, lobby member?
[37:03.740 --> 37:04.280]  I don't even know.
[37:04.280 --> 37:05.780]  I don't know what else you can do.
[37:06.040 --> 37:11.280]  I think it's just a thing of, like, going into the quest, or, like, uh, the mission,
[37:11.740 --> 37:14.440]  like, last time, or just invited us, maybe, once it starts.
[37:15.020 --> 37:15.780]  How do you do that?
[37:16.580 --> 37:19.120]  I think we just gotta head towards the forest, and then...
[37:20.060 --> 37:20.920]  Oh, on our own.
[37:21.380 --> 37:23.100]  Yeah, well, let's do that.
[37:23.600 --> 37:24.200]  That's what I'm doing.
[37:25.080 --> 37:25.800]  Starting quest.
[37:25.960 --> 37:28.680]  Healing a certain amount of damage to a large monster will begin a quest.
[37:28.980 --> 37:29.340]  Oh.
[37:29.540 --> 37:29.900]  But...
[37:29.900 --> 37:30.400]  Oh, all right.
[37:30.580 --> 37:31.560]  But then what?
[37:32.120 --> 37:33.100]  Like, how do you get...
[37:33.100 --> 37:34.360]  How do you get everyone in?
[37:34.760 --> 37:36.560]  I imagine then it sends the auto-in.
[37:36.580 --> 37:37.700]  Yeah, that's exactly...
[37:37.700 --> 37:41.200]  Because Geoff was fighting that thing, and then we all started getting the pull for it.
[37:41.280 --> 37:43.740]  Okay, everyone just start looking around for a big-ass monster, I guess.
[37:43.820 --> 37:44.900]  I'm gonna look for the bear.
[37:45.940 --> 37:47.580]  I found, like, an alligator or something.
[37:47.900 --> 37:48.720]  Can you fuck it up?
[37:49.740 --> 37:50.000]  No.
[37:52.400 --> 37:54.080]  Is it the number two?
[37:54.420 --> 37:56.040]  Geoff, you see that number two on your screen?
[37:56.300 --> 37:57.440]  Yeah, I was there earlier.
[37:57.520 --> 37:58.040]  Oh, I got achievement.
[37:58.740 --> 37:59.100]  Nice.
[38:00.260 --> 38:00.880]  Hey, your cat's...
[38:00.880 --> 38:01.740]  Your cat's with you now.
[38:02.200 --> 38:02.840]  Oh, shit.
[38:04.640 --> 38:05.880]  Did Gobbler just get eaten?
[38:06.060 --> 38:06.360]  Gobbler?
[38:07.280 --> 38:08.300]  Oh, no, he's behind it.
[38:09.120 --> 38:09.980]  Can't jump down there.
[38:10.320 --> 38:10.700]  There we go.
[38:10.740 --> 38:11.160]  Oh, there you go.
[38:12.440 --> 38:12.820]  Ow!
[38:14.900 --> 38:15.280]  Help!
[38:16.220 --> 38:17.760]  How do I fire the help flare?
[38:19.440 --> 38:22.540]  There's a bug on the screen here.
[38:23.180 --> 38:24.080]  Chatacabra has appeared.
[38:24.560 --> 38:25.200]  Yeah, where?
[38:25.440 --> 38:27.720]  How do I know if I can fight this or if it's too dangerous?
[38:29.100 --> 38:31.060]  Uh, if you initiate an attack and it says,
[38:31.060 --> 38:33.680]  it's too dangerous, it's probably too dangerous.
[38:33.680 --> 38:34.620]  I don't know the German for that.
[38:35.840 --> 38:36.480]  Oh, shit.
[38:37.260 --> 38:37.720]  Oh, no.
[38:37.740 --> 38:38.720]  I'm just trying to fight it.
[38:39.280 --> 38:39.780]  Help me.
[38:40.240 --> 38:41.260]  Geoff, it's got to be down here.
[38:41.680 --> 38:42.240]  Invite us.
[38:42.940 --> 38:43.580]  How do I do that?
[38:44.140 --> 38:45.940]  It auto invites if it, uh...
[38:45.940 --> 38:46.500]  Well, it didn't.
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.560]  Maybe, can you do the SOS?
[38:49.680 --> 38:51.220]  If he does SOSes, you can call for help.
[38:51.400 --> 38:52.080]  It's grayed out.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.480]  Oh, oh, Geoff, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[38:57.260 --> 38:57.580]  Go...
[38:57.580 --> 39:02.040]  You need to get around this and then follow that to the right.
[39:04.140 --> 39:05.600]  And then you're going to hang a left.
[39:08.340 --> 39:09.060]  There it is.
[39:09.640 --> 39:10.260]  There it is.
[39:12.080 --> 39:13.880]  Yeah, I think this is too powerful for me.
[39:15.280 --> 39:16.100]  It's this guy.
[39:16.300 --> 39:17.220]  So, will this...
[39:17.220 --> 39:18.620]  Is this going to invite everyone or what?
[39:19.680 --> 39:20.680]  Uh, I hope so.
[39:24.120 --> 39:24.780]  Oh, baby.
[39:25.040 --> 39:26.620]  Oh, there it is.
[39:26.620 --> 39:28.280]  Get me away from this big monster.
[39:28.920 --> 39:29.580]  Joining quest.
[39:29.880 --> 39:30.020]  You guys need to...
[39:30.020 --> 39:31.600]  You guys need to join him now.
[39:31.900 --> 39:33.920]  Oh, boy.
[39:34.060 --> 39:35.020]  You guys need to join him now.
[39:35.020 --> 39:36.060]  It won't let me join him.
[39:36.120 --> 39:36.680]  I'm flying in.
[39:36.860 --> 39:37.620]  Join him now.
[39:38.680 --> 39:39.720]  Nick, you better get in there.
[39:40.140 --> 39:40.940]  I can't join.
[39:42.920 --> 39:44.000]  Oh, it's fine on me.
[39:44.440 --> 39:45.460]  Nick, you better hurry.
[39:46.060 --> 39:46.540]  Look, dude.
[39:47.260 --> 39:47.940]  Invitation list.
[39:48.020 --> 39:48.500]  Can't join.
[39:50.300 --> 39:52.920]  Malbrot accepted quest and is waiting for others to join.
[39:53.040 --> 39:53.460]  Johnny Caviar.
[39:53.460 --> 39:54.120]  I would love to help you.
[39:59.620 --> 40:00.840]  Just stay alive, Geoff.
[40:00.980 --> 40:02.260]  Let me join him.
[40:02.320 --> 40:03.720]  God damn you.
[40:04.200 --> 40:06.740]  Nick decided what he's doing is more important than helping you.
[40:06.740 --> 40:07.760]  It won't let me join.
[40:07.980 --> 40:09.620]  He doesn't want to help you.
[40:10.780 --> 40:12.180]  I'm on my way, baby Pepsi.
[40:14.660 --> 40:15.100]  Thank you.
[40:15.100 --> 40:15.720]  You can get down there.
[40:15.780 --> 40:16.300]  I believe in you.
[40:16.400 --> 40:16.960]  Come on, Andrew.
[40:17.300 --> 40:19.240]  Please just let me help him.
[40:20.760 --> 40:21.420]  I'm here.
[40:22.120 --> 40:23.640]  I broke his leg.
[40:23.740 --> 40:24.320]  His leg broke.
[40:24.620 --> 40:24.780]  Nice.
[40:26.160 --> 40:27.240]  Oh, way to go, Andrew.
[40:27.480 --> 40:28.140]  There you are.
[40:28.420 --> 40:28.740]  There's Johnny Caviar.
[40:28.740 --> 40:29.420]  Just in time.
[40:29.580 --> 40:30.600]  Hell yeah, dude.
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.140]  I triggered the next part of the mission.
[40:40.380 --> 40:42.600]  Nick decided he wanted to do his own quest instead.
[40:42.780 --> 40:43.440]  Didn't want to do that.
[40:43.880 --> 40:44.640]  I need to heal.
[40:44.840 --> 40:45.120]  Sorry.
[40:45.540 --> 40:46.600]  God damn, don't get to it.
[40:46.880 --> 40:47.420]  Son of a bitch.
[40:48.360 --> 40:49.980]  Were you able to join him?
[40:50.400 --> 40:53.200]  Damn it.
[40:54.300 --> 40:56.020]  Yeah, you're whetstoned.
[40:57.820 --> 41:00.240]  God, you got blasted.
[41:01.140 --> 41:03.580]  Uh, they're down in a cave, Gavin.
[41:04.420 --> 41:04.940]  Oof.
[41:05.100 --> 41:05.360]  90.
[41:06.660 --> 41:07.160]  What's up?
[41:07.500 --> 41:08.300]  Oh, not bright.
[41:08.760 --> 41:09.260]  There we go.
[41:09.580 --> 41:11.560]  The boys are here, baby.
[41:11.800 --> 41:12.340]  Hell yeah.
[41:12.580 --> 41:13.700]  Look at them go.
[41:14.200 --> 41:15.300]  Back today.
[41:16.420 --> 41:18.580]  Them slimy frogs that have been away.
[41:20.480 --> 41:24.160]  And then just a lot of action on three screens.
[41:24.160 --> 41:25.900]  And then editor just cut to Nick's.
[41:26.200 --> 41:29.220]  He's just kind of walking slowly through a bog by himself.
[41:30.180 --> 41:31.400]  Not the toilet, Gavin.
[41:34.360 --> 41:35.520]  Oh, we're fucking him up.
[41:35.740 --> 41:36.260]  While it's on the-
[41:36.260 --> 41:37.060]  There we go.
[41:38.980 --> 41:40.120]  Has he got a wound yet?
[41:40.500 --> 41:41.100]  Oh, his leg.
[41:41.620 --> 41:41.960]  Ow!
[41:43.300 --> 41:45.840]  Oh, I wish that I could kill that fucking frog.
[41:46.820 --> 41:48.820]  I'm stuck wandering through this bog.
[41:49.540 --> 41:52.180]  I can't wait to write in my notepad, Nick never showed up.
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.320]  Nick never showed up for his friends.
[41:56.840 --> 41:59.500]  Guys, mom, my mom won't let me go to the mall.
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.000]  I want to start a journal just so I could write in it.
[42:05.100 --> 42:06.940]  Guess who just came back today to myself?
[42:08.860 --> 42:11.160]  Guess who just came back today?
[42:11.300 --> 42:12.280]  Oh, his dick.
[42:12.340 --> 42:12.880]  I hit his dick.
[42:13.320 --> 42:13.780]  Hell yeah.
[42:14.240 --> 42:15.080]  Cut off his little frog dick.
[42:15.080 --> 42:15.960]  Oh, he's got wounds everywhere.
[42:15.960 --> 42:17.500]  Oh, he's got wounds everywhere, dude.
[42:23.620 --> 42:23.960]  Come on.
[42:24.740 --> 42:26.240]  I keep messing up my song.
[42:26.720 --> 42:27.300]  Oh, no.
[42:27.300 --> 42:29.040]  Oh, he's slow.
[42:30.460 --> 42:31.380]  He's trying to get away, Geoff.
[42:31.480 --> 42:31.840]  Get him.
[42:32.180 --> 42:32.880]  God damn it.
[42:35.660 --> 42:37.160]  Oh, I shot him.
[42:37.460 --> 42:38.280]  Who did that, Geoff?
[42:38.320 --> 42:39.160]  Did you do that?
[42:39.240 --> 42:39.940]  I think so, yeah.
[42:40.980 --> 42:41.800]  He's still floundering.
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.440]  Dude, you hit him in the wound and it stopped him.
[42:45.400 --> 42:46.640]  Oh, we got honey here.
[42:46.820 --> 42:48.260]  Are you discovering new tech?
[42:48.440 --> 42:49.980]  It unstopped him.
[42:50.260 --> 42:51.880]  Get on the fucking horse.
[42:51.880 --> 42:52.280]  Get on the horse.
[42:52.280 --> 42:53.140]  Get on the horse.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.120]  Nick's kind of just like doing his own thing by himself.
[42:59.380 --> 42:59.900]  Nope, can't join.
[43:00.060 --> 43:00.960]  Talking to people.
[43:03.060 --> 43:03.600]  Damn it.
[43:03.640 --> 43:04.700]  Why won't it let me get on him?
[43:06.980 --> 43:08.300]  I love Nick so bad.
[43:10.080 --> 43:11.220]  All right, wound destroyed.
[43:11.800 --> 43:12.780]  Yeah, hell yeah, dude.
[43:14.140 --> 43:14.740]  There we go.
[43:14.860 --> 43:16.140]  Hard hits right now.
[43:16.380 --> 43:16.780]  Bam.
[43:17.340 --> 43:18.500]  Way to go, dude.
[43:18.620 --> 43:20.060]  This fight is sick.
[43:20.300 --> 43:21.000]  He is sick.
[43:21.020 --> 43:22.000]  Oh, he's just...
[43:22.000 --> 43:22.400]  Holy shit.
[43:22.400 --> 43:24.340]  Oh, we're giving him so much CTE.
[43:24.660 --> 43:25.840]  Dude, this is fucking wild.
[43:26.440 --> 43:27.820]  You guys might cut his tongue off.
[43:27.900 --> 43:28.760]  Keep cutting him up, dude.
[43:29.400 --> 43:30.220]  Andrew, that's not real.
[43:30.840 --> 43:34.160]  Nick just set up a camp with his cats or whatever.
[43:34.180 --> 43:34.640]  I killed him.
[43:34.960 --> 43:35.220]  Kill him.
[43:35.600 --> 43:35.640]  Whoa.
[43:36.960 --> 43:38.940]  Damn, didn't even need the homie.
[43:39.180 --> 43:39.860]  Hey guys, I'm here.
[43:40.200 --> 43:41.260]  Wow, that's pretty awesome.
[43:41.580 --> 43:42.100]  Is Nick here?
[43:42.600 --> 43:43.280]  No, not yet.
[43:43.560 --> 43:43.920]  Damn.
[43:44.640 --> 43:46.120]  Nick's still like on his own quest or whatever.
[43:46.480 --> 43:47.240]  Carcass time.
[43:48.500 --> 43:49.620]  Get the parts, Geoff.
[43:49.960 --> 43:50.720]  Diary took the bow.
[43:52.960 --> 43:54.340]  Put the sword away.
[43:54.920 --> 43:55.900]  There you go.
[43:57.000 --> 43:57.800]  Yeah, harvest.
[43:58.820 --> 43:59.220]  Nice.
[44:00.220 --> 44:00.940]  Harvest it all.
[44:01.360 --> 44:02.400]  Get some of that hive.
[44:02.480 --> 44:02.760]  Yep.
[44:05.540 --> 44:06.700]  Getting it all, man.
[44:06.800 --> 44:07.880]  Good teamwork, everybody.
[44:08.300 --> 44:09.400]  That was great teamwork.
[44:09.660 --> 44:10.080]  The whole team.
[44:10.540 --> 44:12.680]  Can you harvest anything from like the tongue or anything?
[44:12.780 --> 44:13.320]  Like the front of them?
[44:13.400 --> 44:14.000]  I looked.
[44:14.080 --> 44:14.900]  I couldn't find anything.
[44:15.800 --> 44:16.100]  Bummer.
[44:16.660 --> 44:17.340]  That's a shame.
[44:18.180 --> 44:19.100]  Well, you can end the quest.
[44:19.780 --> 44:20.440]  Go ahead and do that.
[44:21.060 --> 44:21.500]  There you go.
[44:21.680 --> 44:22.380]  Way to go, guys.
[44:22.400 --> 44:23.640]  Wow, quest complete.
[44:23.740 --> 44:24.500]  Way to go, boys.
[44:26.600 --> 44:27.400]  Regulatreon.com
[44:28.800 --> 44:30.100]  Do you pay for that one?
[44:32.640 --> 44:33.040]  Achievement!
[44:33.220 --> 44:33.620]  Achievement!
[44:33.620 --> 44:34.620]  Oh, you got Achieva.
[44:34.780 --> 44:36.920]  Wow, the hunt is on.
[44:37.100 --> 44:38.520]  Dude, Nick doesn't even have that achievement.
[44:38.640 --> 44:38.980]  That's awesome.
[44:39.260 --> 44:39.480]  Oh, yeah.
[44:40.100 --> 44:43.300]  I wonder if the audience wants us to play this again someday.
[44:43.640 --> 44:45.940]  I kind of want you to play it again, but I want to know.
[44:46.180 --> 44:48.960]  But like with the knowledge of what we're doing and how.
[44:49.300 --> 44:51.200]  Oh my god, I found access to a map.
[44:51.200 --> 44:51.980]  I don't know.
[44:52.100 --> 44:52.240]  Oh, wow.
[44:52.540 --> 44:53.140]  It's in the diary?
[44:53.380 --> 44:53.860]  That's awesome.
[44:54.600 --> 44:56.660]  Well, there's so much stuff on this map to kill.
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.460]  I didn't make the highlights, guys.
[44:59.400 --> 45:00.220]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[45:00.740 --> 45:03.040]  Well, thank you guys so much for watching Monster Hunter.
