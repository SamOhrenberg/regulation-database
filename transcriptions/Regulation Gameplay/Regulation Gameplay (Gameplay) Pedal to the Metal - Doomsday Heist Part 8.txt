[00:00.000 --> 00:01.980]  I've got a mute button now.
[00:02.380 --> 00:05.580]  What? You're so fast on the mute, dude.
[00:05.740 --> 00:07.160]  What did you do?
[00:08.480 --> 00:09.820]  Got a little pedal.
[00:10.940 --> 00:11.640]  Oh, nice.
[00:11.840 --> 00:13.140]  So it's not even a button.
[00:14.380 --> 00:15.480]  It's a foot button.
[00:15.980 --> 00:16.600]  It's a foot button.
[00:17.060 --> 00:19.440]  It's a classic foot button.
[00:22.660 --> 00:24.820]  Hello, welcome to More Regulation Heist.
[00:24.900 --> 00:26.120]  Gavin has a foot button.
[00:26.120 --> 00:28.340]  He's been...
[00:29.420 --> 00:30.080]  Flipping around.
[00:31.480 --> 00:34.080]  That can't possibly be the beginning, can it?
[00:34.160 --> 00:34.720]  That was awful.
[00:35.380 --> 00:37.240]  I just stole it from that.
[00:38.920 --> 00:40.180]  That's gotta be the start now.
[00:40.360 --> 00:40.500]  Ow.
[00:41.360 --> 00:42.020]  That's funny.
[00:42.340 --> 00:44.860]  Alright, so, we're back at Doomsday.
[00:44.960 --> 00:45.980]  We're Doomsday Heist-ing.
[00:46.520 --> 00:47.800]  I ran into a car.
[00:48.200 --> 00:50.200]  We gotta be close to the end of this, right?
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.020]  Where are we? What are we doing?
[00:52.020 --> 00:54.100]  We got three more...
[00:54.100 --> 00:55.940]  set up...
[00:55.940 --> 00:57.500]  missions. But they're missions.
[00:59.000 --> 00:59.980]  So I sent you all invites.
[01:01.920 --> 01:02.400]  What?
[01:02.660 --> 01:06.460]  It says you're invited on my screen.
[01:07.200 --> 01:08.120]  I don't...
[01:08.120 --> 01:09.040]  Ah! I got hit by a car.
[01:09.320 --> 01:10.540]  That was... Gavin, goddammit.
[01:10.900 --> 01:12.340]  And I'll do it the second way.
[01:12.660 --> 01:14.260]  Hey, there it is.
[01:14.340 --> 01:16.980]  It lies. The game likes to lie.
[01:17.880 --> 01:18.900]  Gavin hit me with a car.
[01:18.900 --> 01:21.120]  But, rules of the road...
[01:21.120 --> 01:21.860]  I was on a motorcycle.
[01:22.440 --> 01:24.000]  Ah, yeah, well that's legal.
[01:24.440 --> 01:24.980]  Rules of the road.
[01:27.720 --> 01:28.120]  Escort.
[01:29.920 --> 01:31.060]  That's actually how I failed
[01:31.060 --> 01:32.960]  my first learner's test. I assumed
[01:32.960 --> 01:35.140]  that you can't drive into bikes.
[01:35.400 --> 01:36.180]  But no, it's clear.
[01:36.180 --> 01:36.840]  Rules of the road.
[01:38.460 --> 01:40.900]  Okay, so we have an ult, and we have to help the ult?
[01:41.220 --> 01:42.780]  Yep. Dude, this rocks.
[01:44.320 --> 01:44.720]  Wow.
[01:45.740 --> 01:47.040]  Yeah, let's do it. Alright, cool.
[01:47.040 --> 01:49.260]  I'm ready. Let's do this.
[01:49.440 --> 01:51.360]  Let's do it. Let's lay it all out, baby.
[01:51.880 --> 01:53.160]  Is this the longest we've
[01:53.160 --> 01:54.960]  gone without heisting? Probably.
[01:55.160 --> 01:57.200]  Geoff's been in town a lot, so
[01:57.200 --> 01:59.000]  we've had to, you know...
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.860]  Now he's away for two weeks.
[02:01.280 --> 02:02.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So a lot of heists
[02:02.820 --> 02:04.960]  about to get put into the
[02:04.960 --> 02:06.540]  backlog, baby. In my opinion,
[02:06.820 --> 02:08.000]  slightly too long to be away.
[02:09.760 --> 02:10.620]  Oh, two weeks? Yeah.
[02:11.000 --> 02:11.220]  I agree.
[02:14.140 --> 02:15.020]  Seven days is
[02:15.020 --> 02:16.440]  probably the max you could do it, right?
[02:16.620 --> 02:17.780]  I don't know.
[02:19.480 --> 02:20.560]  It's quite a bit of time.
[02:20.580 --> 02:21.600]  Do we all want to get in the same vehicle?
[02:21.760 --> 02:23.320]  Yeah, let's get in mine.
[02:24.060 --> 02:26.800]  Alright, take me, Uber driver.
[02:28.140 --> 02:28.940]  What crew
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.340]  am I in? What logo is this?
[02:30.760 --> 02:33.080]  Am I in Stram Town?
[02:33.460 --> 02:34.140]  Oh, it's your car.
[02:34.560 --> 02:35.400]  It's Achievement Hunter.
[02:36.220 --> 02:37.180]  Oh, I heard of them.
[02:39.860 --> 02:40.540]  They made
[02:40.540 --> 02:42.660]  music videos and stuff, right? Music groups?
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.000]  Yeah, they made
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.300]  shitty music. I heard you were a big fan of that.
[02:46.860 --> 02:47.700]  Oh, it's dreadful.
[02:48.580 --> 02:50.460]  I think at this point, Andrew has drafted
[02:50.460 --> 02:52.380]  me personally three or four times.
[02:52.540 --> 02:53.420]  Yeah, I am.
[02:54.380 --> 02:56.380]  Well, you're kind of like a jack-of-all-trades guy. You got
[02:56.380 --> 02:58.580]  a lot of things that are draftable about you.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.040]  He's a draft-of-all-trades guy.
[03:00.040 --> 03:02.600]  I didn't factor in how many people wouldn't understand
[03:02.600 --> 03:04.720]  what I was doing with the Peeves draft.
[03:05.600 --> 03:06.560]  It was fun to read
[03:06.560 --> 03:08.820]  comments of being like, Andrew's a foot guy?
[03:08.980 --> 03:09.360]  This is crazy.
[03:09.800 --> 03:11.880]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[03:12.260 --> 03:13.400]  I thought it was
[03:13.400 --> 03:14.320]  very obvious, Brock.
[03:14.620 --> 03:16.040]  Although, I think it's funny.
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.260]  Oh, shit. That was a bit rough on it.
[03:19.800 --> 03:20.200]  Thanks.
[03:21.300 --> 03:22.140]  Rough trade, bud.
[03:23.400 --> 03:25.580]  That door's gone. That side panel's
[03:25.580 --> 03:26.580]  gone. Real good.
[03:27.920 --> 03:28.580]  Oh, there goes the window.
[03:29.180 --> 03:31.440]  Oh, there goes... alright. Window, you
[03:31.440 --> 03:31.580]  say?
[03:34.720 --> 03:35.420]  Let's see if we can
[03:35.420 --> 03:36.780]  get all the doors and windows off this.
[03:36.780 --> 03:37.500]  Okay.
[03:38.720 --> 03:40.200]  Well, that's not gonna do it.
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.780]  Oh, there goes the back window.
[03:42.960 --> 03:43.820]  Keep it coming. Thank you.
[03:44.140 --> 03:46.520]  Oh, little hole. There we go.
[03:47.120 --> 03:47.820]  Got the back window.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.500]  That might do more than our window, but we just threw that.
[03:52.520 --> 03:52.580]  That
[03:53.140 --> 03:54.120]  surprisingly got me.
[03:56.740 --> 03:58.460]  I bet you if you would've had us
[03:58.460 --> 03:59.400]  get rid of the window.
[04:01.180 --> 04:01.980]  Whoa, Jesus.
[04:04.100 --> 04:04.500]  Ooh, people.
[04:04.500 --> 04:06.020]  I don't think they're gonna help.
[04:06.160 --> 04:06.700]  Oh, God.
[04:06.800 --> 04:10.540]  There we go.
[04:11.020 --> 04:12.520]  So now we're
[04:12.520 --> 04:14.340]  ready. Now we have like a 360
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.020]  degree view if any
[04:16.020 --> 04:17.280]  trouble comes our way.
[04:17.580 --> 04:20.080]  The Achievement Hunter logo looks really weird with all that red.
[04:20.120 --> 04:21.980]  The Achievement Hunter logo.
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.400]  We gotta knock the hood off. We don't own that.
[04:26.620 --> 04:26.940]  Say goodbye.
[04:28.180 --> 04:29.360]  Bernie doesn't own it yet.
[04:30.120 --> 04:30.780]  Oh, man.
[04:31.920 --> 04:32.940]  Oh, there's a man.
[04:33.200 --> 04:34.360]  Help me get my leg off.
[04:36.940 --> 04:37.780]  He lived!
[04:38.600 --> 04:38.980]  Oh, he's gone.
[04:39.660 --> 04:40.540]  He's gone.
[04:41.940 --> 04:48.990]  Oh, I forgot how fun this game is.
[04:50.020 --> 04:50.700]  As fun as this?
[04:51.760 --> 04:52.220]  Yeah.
[04:52.940 --> 04:53.840]  Exactly that fun.
[04:56.700 --> 04:57.260]  Wee!
[04:57.260 --> 04:57.780]  Wow!
[04:59.180 --> 05:00.220]  That was pretty sick.
[05:00.600 --> 05:02.020]  In a minivan too?
[05:02.380 --> 05:04.140]  Yeah, that was really good.
[05:07.300 --> 05:08.720]  Real Vin Diesel there.
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.320]  What's going on over there?
[05:12.680 --> 05:14.320]  Oh, what's that? A little tapping?
[05:18.520 --> 05:19.300]  Press Y
[05:19.300 --> 05:20.100]  to break the door.
[05:21.540 --> 05:22.500]  Ooh, I got the back
[05:22.500 --> 05:23.200]  the back
[05:23.200 --> 05:24.340]  the back
[05:25.980 --> 05:27.200]  Looney Tunes is back.
[05:28.200 --> 05:29.500]  Should we go over the mountain?
[05:32.780 --> 05:33.980]  Yeah, because
[05:33.980 --> 05:36.120]  then when we go down, I wanna go
[05:36.120 --> 05:38.220]  coming down the mountain
[05:38.220 --> 05:39.920]  and then Nick kicks in
[05:41.980 --> 05:43.920]  and then we're like Jane's Addiction
[05:43.920 --> 05:46.040]  and then I think that's cool.
[05:47.080 --> 05:48.000]  Like Jane's Addiction.
[05:48.500 --> 05:48.800]  Yeah.
[05:49.140 --> 05:51.400]  Being like Jane's Addiction is a rule of the road.
[05:51.400 --> 05:52.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.020]  What was she addicted to?
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.020]  Uh, I think
[05:57.020 --> 05:57.680]  heroin?
[05:59.340 --> 05:59.740]  Yeah.
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.760]  We lost another piece.
[06:03.680 --> 06:04.340]  Popped a door.
[06:05.200 --> 06:05.600]  Dammit.
[06:06.520 --> 06:07.280]  Saved the door.
[06:08.060 --> 06:09.820]  Wait a minute, are these minivan doors open that way?
[06:09.880 --> 06:10.320]  They don't slide?
[06:11.380 --> 06:12.720]  This is old school, baby.
[06:15.420 --> 06:17.200]  Have you ever had an automatic door?
[06:18.040 --> 06:18.320]  Car door?
[06:18.320 --> 06:18.740]  Yeah.
[06:19.960 --> 06:20.840]  And minivan.
[06:21.540 --> 06:21.900]  No.
[06:23.760 --> 06:24.840]  I've never owned one.
[06:25.800 --> 06:27.480]  I've never personally owned one.
[06:27.620 --> 06:30.740]  I have a car now that I can hold a button on my key fob
[06:30.740 --> 06:32.640]  and it starts and I don't even have to be in the car.
[06:32.760 --> 06:33.340]  That's crazy.
[06:33.940 --> 06:36.220]  Hey, on a hot day, pretty special.
[06:36.940 --> 06:37.380]  Oh boy.
[06:37.640 --> 06:38.100]  Uh oh.
[06:38.340 --> 06:39.020]  Uh oh.
[06:40.260 --> 06:44.720]  Honestly, anything was an upgrade
[06:44.720 --> 06:45.480]  from the previous.
[06:45.480 --> 06:47.100]  Oh, we got a second door.
[06:49.980 --> 06:51.980]  That car was a mess.
[06:53.680 --> 06:55.040]  Half the time you come in and be like,
[06:55.120 --> 06:55.700]  I got it.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.400]  I sold it for like a thousand dollars
[06:59.400 --> 07:01.120]  to a guy named Tony who left a note on it.
[07:01.440 --> 07:02.380]  I'm surprised
[07:03.040 --> 07:04.140]  you got any money.
[07:04.500 --> 07:07.200]  I assumed you were just going to roll it into a riverbed.
[07:07.540 --> 07:08.980]  That was the next plan.
[07:09.200 --> 07:11.480]  If Tony didn't want it, it was going...
[07:12.700 --> 07:13.640]  There was going to be
[07:13.640 --> 07:15.560]  a car serial killer that people were going to start
[07:15.560 --> 07:17.100]  talking about in Austin.
[07:17.660 --> 07:19.740]  How expensive is it to throw away
[07:19.740 --> 07:20.120]  a car?
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.160]  It costs money to like...
[07:23.160 --> 07:25.760]  In California, I had
[07:25.760 --> 07:27.640]  one that I had to get rid of and they gave me
[07:27.640 --> 07:28.960]  like a thousand dollars. That was cool.
[07:29.720 --> 07:30.700]  Come on, man. Gas.
[07:31.420 --> 07:32.900]  The car just turned off.
[07:33.080 --> 07:35.020]  The car just turned off?
[07:35.560 --> 07:37.940]  Is this like too steep? It didn't get any steeper.
[07:38.560 --> 07:39.120]  What just happened?
[07:39.340 --> 07:39.520]  No!
[07:42.540 --> 07:43.380]  It's rolling.
[07:45.860 --> 07:47.180]  Why would you do that?
[07:47.240 --> 07:49.100]  I like this. This is an interesting game.
[07:49.340 --> 07:51.720]  I'm trying to motivate you, Gavin.
[07:52.220 --> 07:53.700]  Yeah, motivate me in reverse.
[07:53.960 --> 07:55.320]  There you go. But look,
[07:55.380 --> 07:57.500]  you built up enough head of steam so you
[07:57.500 --> 07:59.120]  can get there. Oh my god.
[07:59.340 --> 07:59.920]  Oh my god.
[08:01.700 --> 08:03.300]  This is a freaking game.
[08:04.100 --> 08:05.260]  This is a road technically
[08:05.260 --> 08:06.220]  and it won't do it.
[08:06.220 --> 08:07.560]  Oh, don't fall.
[08:07.660 --> 08:08.460]  What are you doing?
[08:11.940 --> 08:13.060]  I'm gonna have to push.
[08:14.960 --> 08:16.300]  I might be able to do it backwards.
[08:17.060 --> 08:17.320]  Okay.
[08:18.300 --> 08:18.860]  Push, Andrew.
[08:19.560 --> 08:20.240]  I'm trying.
[08:23.620 --> 08:25.960]  Why would backwards be the solution to this?
[08:26.560 --> 08:27.620]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[08:28.440 --> 08:29.280]  Oh! Oh!
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.740]  Oh god.
[08:32.460 --> 08:32.760]  Oh no.
[08:32.760 --> 08:34.220]  Okay, I got it.
[08:35.040 --> 08:40.960]  Can we go to the objective?
[08:44.500 --> 08:45.440]  Okay.
[08:47.140 --> 08:48.100]  Manage vehicles.
[08:49.540 --> 08:50.460]  Vehicle.
[08:50.860 --> 08:51.060]  Yeah.
[08:52.260 --> 08:53.500]  Let's see.
[08:54.520 --> 08:55.900]  We're dressed
[08:56.630 --> 08:57.660]  like this
[08:58.590 --> 09:00.540]  to be in this mission.
[09:00.540 --> 09:01.820]  And it's...
[09:03.580 --> 09:04.880]  This is great.
[09:06.180 --> 09:09.100]  Sorry guys, the heist van's out. I had to borrow my mom's.
[09:09.280 --> 09:10.560]  Are you getting in, son?
[09:11.080 --> 09:12.220]  Didn't you lock the doors?
[09:12.500 --> 09:14.060]  What are you doing, dude? Come on.
[09:14.380 --> 09:15.140]  I didn't lock the doors.
[09:15.580 --> 09:17.880]  There's a door under the car, which is where you were.
[09:18.660 --> 09:20.680]  But also, the windows are broken.
[09:20.820 --> 09:21.580]  Unlock the door.
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.440]  I didn't design the game, Nick.
[09:23.820 --> 09:25.680]  I can't just jump through the windows.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.380]  I was thinking real life.
[09:29.460 --> 09:29.940]  Alright,
[09:30.100 --> 09:31.340]  I'm just going to join back on the road.
[09:31.720 --> 09:31.960]  Yeah.
[09:32.640 --> 09:33.880]  Alright, I like the road.
[09:35.060 --> 09:37.220]  Because that shortcut wasn't short.
[09:37.220 --> 09:39.440]  Oh my god. Gavin's never farmed.
[09:40.380 --> 09:41.700]  I thought he was doing great.
[09:42.120 --> 09:42.400]  Nah.
[09:43.780 --> 09:45.640]  We still got two of our doors.
[09:46.280 --> 09:47.300]  I felt like it was a bad vote.
[09:47.620 --> 09:48.380]  We can lose the doors.
[09:51.160 --> 09:52.000]  Don't go backwards.
[09:56.100 --> 09:56.580]  Jeez.
[09:56.580 --> 09:58.480]  I said,
[09:58.680 --> 10:00.060]  don't go backwards, man.
[10:09.030 --> 10:10.530]  There you go.
[10:11.450 --> 10:12.410]  Nicely done.
[10:17.180 --> 10:18.020]  That way.
[10:18.520 --> 10:19.380]  The train. Hit it.
[10:20.100 --> 10:22.000]  Land it. Land us up there.
[10:22.820 --> 10:26.340]  Oh, you got one of the doors by doing that.
[10:26.880 --> 10:27.380]  Good job.
[10:29.240 --> 10:31.060]  Alright, now we're ready for heisting.
[10:31.500 --> 10:32.280]  Alright, now we heist.
[10:32.820 --> 10:33.740]  Gavin away.
[10:36.920 --> 10:37.940]  Can't see great.
[10:43.160 --> 10:44.420]  Oh, this car is
[10:44.420 --> 10:45.620]  just crumpled.
[10:46.440 --> 10:48.740]  How far ahead can I throw this
[10:48.740 --> 10:50.240]  before we pass it and not have it killed?
[10:51.100 --> 10:51.380]  Alright.
[10:52.800 --> 10:53.220]  It's over there.
[10:53.600 --> 10:56.700]  I can't see the smoke.
[10:57.300 --> 10:57.920]  Holy shit.
[10:58.900 --> 11:00.440]  What's the problem? It's just over there.
[11:00.460 --> 11:00.860]  I don't either.
[11:00.860 --> 11:01.400]  I don't either.
[11:01.660 --> 11:03.040]  Throw it and I'll mark it.
[11:03.480 --> 11:04.960]  It's over there.
[11:06.580 --> 11:08.200]  It's gonna go over it.
[11:10.220 --> 11:11.580]  That was pretty cool.
[11:11.900 --> 11:12.480]  That was awesome.
[11:12.700 --> 11:14.160]  That was great.
[11:15.300 --> 11:16.000]  Hey, tents.
[11:18.100 --> 11:18.380]  Okay.
[11:20.220 --> 11:21.580]  Let's just get there this one.
[11:21.720 --> 11:23.440]  We're less than a mile away.
[11:23.940 --> 11:24.860]  We've almost made it.
[11:25.720 --> 11:26.720]  It's so close.
[11:31.000 --> 11:31.400]  Octopussy.
[11:32.640 --> 11:34.700]  What? He drives his car
[11:34.700 --> 11:35.400]  on the train track.
[11:39.640 --> 11:40.880]  That's what I think of when I hear
[11:40.880 --> 11:42.080]  Octopussy. Yeah, that's right.
[11:45.940 --> 11:46.860]  What if it was called
[11:46.860 --> 11:47.720]  Octopussy Hole?
[11:48.620 --> 11:50.920]  Oh boy. I think there probably is a movie
[11:50.920 --> 11:52.900]  called that. I think it's probably a different
[11:52.900 --> 11:53.260]  movie.
[11:58.070 --> 11:59.190]  I have to get off
[11:59.190 --> 11:59.910]  this here train track.
[12:00.590 --> 12:01.830]  Yeah, Octopussy style.
[12:03.490 --> 12:06.250]  Was her name just Octopussy or was it a code name?
[12:07.950 --> 12:09.050]  Well, she also had an octopus.
[12:09.370 --> 12:11.530]  Oh shit, people. What the hell?
[12:12.610 --> 12:13.930]  Oh no. I thought that would break.
[12:14.230 --> 12:16.410]  The wall did not give way.
[12:16.630 --> 12:17.290]  What do we need to do?
[12:18.090 --> 12:18.750]  Guns out.
[12:19.910 --> 12:20.110]  Okay.
[12:21.330 --> 12:22.050]  Everyone got out.
[12:22.730 --> 12:24.170]  Get ready to restart here in a second.
[12:25.670 --> 12:27.770]  As long as we're making the drive again.
[12:27.770 --> 12:29.290]  Yeah, absolutely. Shoot him in the head.
[12:30.070 --> 12:31.050]  Snack, snack, snack.
[12:31.490 --> 12:33.790]  Oh, I can't
[12:33.790 --> 12:35.050]  get through the gate.
[12:38.190 --> 12:38.630]  Ow!
[12:39.350 --> 12:40.490]  Don't worry, I covered you.
[12:41.030 --> 12:42.390]  Oh my god!
[12:43.230 --> 12:43.610]  What's up, man?
[12:44.850 --> 12:45.930]  Oh, he's alive.
[12:47.650 --> 12:48.850]  There's a lot of guys right here!
[12:50.990 --> 12:52.030]  Oh, my pallets.
[12:52.750 --> 12:53.130]  The clones.
[12:54.390 --> 12:55.050]  They are clones.
[12:55.050 --> 12:58.110]  Why is it the same guy 100 times?
[12:58.410 --> 12:58.930]  They're clones.
[13:01.150 --> 13:02.590]  Oh, are you being for real?
[13:02.990 --> 13:03.190]  Yeah.
[13:06.510 --> 13:08.630]  I thought we were having fun.
[13:09.750 --> 13:10.870]  No, you were being serious.
[13:11.150 --> 13:11.970]  I'm also having fun.
[13:12.490 --> 13:14.670]  Oh, I didn't know you were having fun.
[13:14.910 --> 13:15.290]  That's cool.
[13:16.390 --> 13:17.670]  I killed a lot of pallets there.
[13:19.130 --> 13:20.030]  Are we doing grenades?
[13:20.950 --> 13:22.650]  This guy will not die.
[13:23.310 --> 13:23.950]  Grenade!
[13:24.390 --> 13:24.950]  Flanking.
[13:28.410 --> 13:30.390]  Just don't blow up the blue one,
[13:30.430 --> 13:31.290]  whatever that is.
[13:32.970 --> 13:34.570]  I'm glad you said that.
[13:38.270 --> 13:40.330]  Oh, not that one. That's the blue one.
[13:44.690 --> 13:45.910]  Where are... ow!
[13:46.490 --> 13:47.050]  They're all...
[13:47.050 --> 13:49.010]  Did you say, where art thou?
[13:49.930 --> 13:51.070]  Where art thou?
[13:51.070 --> 13:51.930]  Oh, brother!
[13:54.490 --> 13:55.530]  Oh, flip that bastard.
[13:56.150 --> 14:00.030]  This is for you.
[14:00.810 --> 14:01.210]  Whoops.
[14:01.890 --> 14:04.070]  That guy fell in a hole.
[14:05.810 --> 14:07.450]  Now that's a British word.
[14:07.770 --> 14:09.270]  Yeah, that was a good one.
[14:10.910 --> 14:11.890]  I'm getting him.
[14:12.870 --> 14:13.590]  I'm getting him.
[14:13.910 --> 14:16.330]  Oh, someone unleashed the pipes.
[14:18.270 --> 14:18.970]  Oh, what the hell?
[14:18.970 --> 14:21.590]  Oh, ramp cars and thingy cars.
[14:23.370 --> 14:25.410]  Alright, you answered all my questions.

[14:27.070 --> 14:28.250]  Ramp! Ramp car!
[14:29.450 --> 14:30.190]  Ramp car!

[14:49.310 --> 14:50.910]  Guys, guys, ramp car's stuck.
[14:51.210 --> 14:52.390]  Guys, ramp car's stuck.
[14:52.670 --> 14:54.670]  Sounds like a problem for ramp car.
[14:54.870 --> 14:55.790]  Oh, ramp car.
[14:56.690 --> 14:59.070]  Guys, this is not good. I'm stuck.

[15:03.590 --> 15:04.290]  Nick, give him a boost.
[15:05.110 --> 15:05.310]  Alright.
[15:08.130 --> 15:10.050]  It's not really boosting.
[15:11.050 --> 15:12.390]  Guys, it's not boosting!
[15:13.550 --> 15:14.470]  There we go.
[15:16.030 --> 15:16.790]  Ramp car's free.
[15:22.030 --> 15:22.750]  Help me!
[15:23.690 --> 15:24.250]  We got him.
[15:25.030 --> 15:26.310]  I'm on my way to help you, Andrew.
[15:28.730 --> 15:29.430]  We're doing that.
[15:31.130 --> 15:32.630]  Andrew, I'm the helpful one. Here I come.
[15:32.850 --> 15:32.970]  Yep.

[16:01.300 --> 16:02.720]  Gavin, get in the car!
[16:03.820 --> 16:05.140]  I wanted to be on the missiles.
[16:06.120 --> 16:06.600]  Get in!
[16:06.740 --> 16:08.400]  You are on the missiles now.
[16:08.880 --> 16:12.500]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[16:12.500 --> 16:13.600]  Fire the missiles!
[16:14.340 --> 16:15.180]  Gavin, fire the missiles!
[16:15.540 --> 16:17.820]  Did I get a different seat?
[16:18.660 --> 16:18.940]  Gavin!
[16:19.360 --> 16:20.280]  Someone else get in!
[16:21.360 --> 16:23.300]  I don't trust him with the controls!
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.280]  Gavin, fire the missiles!
[16:27.660 --> 16:29.080]  Did I get in the wrong seat?
[16:31.180 --> 16:31.760]  Gavin!
[16:32.340 --> 16:34.360]  Somebody get in! He left!
[16:35.020 --> 16:36.300]  I got out, I couldn't do it.
[16:36.760 --> 16:37.500]  Oh my god.
[16:38.080 --> 16:39.020]  Gavin, fire the missiles!
[16:42.700 --> 16:44.380]  I'm distracting the ramp car!
[16:44.840 --> 16:45.460]  Do you have missiles?
[16:46.320 --> 16:47.120]  He's doing it!
[16:47.620 --> 16:49.020]  How did you not do this?
[16:49.180 --> 16:51.700]  It moved and then it unmoved.
[16:51.700 --> 16:53.120]  It moved...
[16:53.120 --> 16:55.720]  and then it unmoved.
[16:56.200 --> 16:57.000]  Ramp car.
[16:58.980 --> 16:59.860]  We gotta move, we gotta move.
[17:00.420 --> 17:01.660]  Come on guys, I'm distracting the ramp car.
[17:04.940 --> 17:05.340]  Nice.
[17:05.820 --> 17:06.740]  Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[17:07.340 --> 17:08.800]  It only fires when stationary.
[17:08.800 --> 17:09.400]  Ramp car.
[17:10.880 --> 17:12.540]  Ramp cars, lead way.
[17:13.720 --> 17:15.780]  Yeah, Andrew, it must have been your fault.
[17:16.060 --> 17:16.940]  Oh yeah, it was my fault.
[17:18.600 --> 17:19.920]  I'll clear the roadblocks.
[17:20.220 --> 17:20.660]  Ramp car.
[17:21.360 --> 17:22.820]  We just gotta help Ulp.
[17:23.700 --> 17:24.500]  Here I come, boys.
[17:25.580 --> 17:26.860]  I'm coming through.
[17:31.920 --> 17:33.080]  Stop us for a sec.
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.300]  Andrew, I need to shoot some choppers.
[17:37.300 --> 17:38.020]  Ramp car.
[17:39.480 --> 17:40.220]  Here we go.
[17:47.460 --> 17:48.460]  That's for you.
[17:50.280 --> 17:51.000]  Ramp car.
[17:52.180 --> 17:52.960]  Fire, dammit.
[17:53.920 --> 17:54.900]  Nice, good work.
[17:56.340 --> 17:57.200]  I'm gonna get you closer.
[17:57.420 --> 17:59.080]  The helicopter just ran over a clone.
[17:59.240 --> 17:59.740]  That was awesome.
[18:00.780 --> 18:01.740]  Good shot.
[18:03.520 --> 18:04.480]  Let's go, boys.
[18:04.820 --> 18:05.360]  Ramp car.
[18:08.200 --> 18:09.480]  He's losing it.
[18:09.480 --> 18:10.240]  Ramp car.
[18:12.020 --> 18:12.740]  Let's go, boys.
[18:18.880 --> 18:22.280]  I got really nervous that this tunnel was gonna be longer than I thought it was.
[18:22.500 --> 18:22.900]  Don't worry.
[18:23.300 --> 18:24.120]  Ramp car's out in front.
[18:25.460 --> 18:26.180]  Ramp car.
[18:27.020 --> 18:27.820]  Ramp car.
[18:30.140 --> 18:30.760]  Alright, here we go.
[18:33.460 --> 18:35.060]  Let me aim, damn you.
[18:35.600 --> 18:36.180]  Alright, here we go.
[18:36.740 --> 18:37.760]  Unload, Nick.
[18:38.080 --> 18:39.940]  Well, what if I told you we're too close?
[18:41.080 --> 18:41.880]  Too close?
[18:42.500 --> 18:44.020]  I'm directly under it.
[18:44.160 --> 18:45.240]  This is an angled thing.
[18:45.460 --> 18:46.160]  Do you need to be higher?
[18:47.540 --> 18:47.940]  Ramp car.
[18:51.040 --> 18:51.840]  What's happening?
[18:52.940 --> 18:54.000]  Gavin rammed us.
[18:55.100 --> 18:55.540]  Oh, he did?
[18:55.680 --> 18:56.740]  Right here.
[18:57.800 --> 18:57.940]  Perfect.
[18:58.820 --> 18:59.600]  Ramp car.
[18:59.600 --> 19:00.680]  Ramp car.
[19:02.880 --> 19:05.540]  There are clones right outside our door.
[19:05.660 --> 19:07.040]  Will you let me aim, car?
[19:07.800 --> 19:08.580]  I'm getting the clones.
[19:09.060 --> 19:10.440]  There it goes.
[19:13.740 --> 19:15.000]  That's for you.
[19:15.360 --> 19:16.280]  Ramp car retribution.
[19:17.320 --> 19:18.700]  Nice ramp car, Aaron.
[19:18.960 --> 19:20.080]  Thank you very much, Gavin.
[19:21.220 --> 19:22.400]  That was awesome.
[19:24.120 --> 19:26.860]  Dude, helicopters falling out of the sky looks great.
[19:27.840 --> 19:28.900]  You got these, Nick.
[19:28.940 --> 19:30.340]  Merry Christmas.
[19:30.640 --> 19:31.180]  Ramp car.
[19:32.920 --> 19:33.900]  Great shots.
[19:34.060 --> 19:35.280]  There's another one behind.
[19:36.740 --> 19:37.260]  Sorry.
[19:38.440 --> 19:39.120]  It's alright.
[19:41.780 --> 19:43.080]  Now he's just out of range.
[19:43.320 --> 19:43.920]  It's above me.
[19:44.840 --> 19:45.600]  Ramp car.
[19:45.860 --> 19:47.900]  Hold on.
[19:48.480 --> 19:49.000]  Sorry.
[19:50.560 --> 19:52.260]  I was already in the process of moving.
[19:52.440 --> 19:54.020]  It's slow when I go to action.
[19:54.800 --> 19:56.280]  Plus, we have to follow this guy.
[19:56.340 --> 19:58.140]  I feel like we have to be moving more than we are.
[19:59.580 --> 20:01.640]  I think they just keep spawning to an extent.
[20:03.040 --> 20:03.640]  Probably right.
[20:06.140 --> 20:07.260]  There you go.
[20:07.740 --> 20:08.220]  He's swooping.
[20:09.900 --> 20:11.400]  Here's a little swoop for you.
[20:11.600 --> 20:11.920]  Ramp car.
[20:13.140 --> 20:14.220]  Double ramp car.
[20:14.480 --> 20:15.360]  That was awesome.
[20:18.080 --> 20:19.500]  Ramp car coming right at you.
[20:20.620 --> 20:22.420]  Is there a lock on, Nick, for this?
[20:22.420 --> 20:24.400]  Yes, there's absolutely a lock on.
[20:24.820 --> 20:25.520]  I was going to say.
[20:25.920 --> 20:28.180]  If that was just you aiming, insane.
[20:28.520 --> 20:29.680]  Nope, not that good.
[20:30.280 --> 20:31.940]  Oh, what a ramp.
[20:32.440 --> 20:33.760]  That ruled.
[20:34.260 --> 20:34.920]  Nice shot.
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.140]  They're limited to...
[20:38.140 --> 20:39.880]  I'm just going to drive with it.
[20:40.780 --> 20:41.280]  Get them moving.
[20:45.020 --> 20:45.480]  Whoa.
[20:46.040 --> 20:47.260]  What is shooting at us?
[20:49.340 --> 20:50.260]  Ramp car.
[20:52.960 --> 20:54.900]  That helicopter is nasty.
[20:56.980 --> 20:58.320]  Here we go.
[20:58.880 --> 21:00.220]  Hey, Colt, when you're stopping,
[21:00.360 --> 21:01.980]  let us know so we can get closer.
[21:06.400 --> 21:07.680]  Good ramp car.
[21:08.220 --> 21:09.960]  You want some? Ramp car!
[21:14.240 --> 21:15.620]  Excuse me, cloned man.
[21:15.880 --> 21:17.760]  Move, please. Excuse me.
[21:18.060 --> 21:18.120]  Whoa.
[21:19.560 --> 21:20.780]  You doomed us.
[21:20.780 --> 21:21.320]  Oh, no.
[21:23.040 --> 21:24.340]  Over the ridge.
[21:25.320 --> 21:25.740]  Ramp car.
[21:27.480 --> 21:28.880]  You think that's it? It's ramp car.
[21:29.680 --> 21:30.900]  I don't know if you can...
[21:30.900 --> 21:31.320]  There we go.
[21:32.340 --> 21:33.200]  You did it.
[21:34.220 --> 21:36.240]  This thing made that much air.
[21:36.460 --> 21:37.040]  Way to go, boys.
[21:38.740 --> 21:40.320]  Where is he trying to get to?
[21:41.200 --> 21:43.100]  I don't know.
[21:45.200 --> 21:46.460]  Please, sir, I want to aim.
[21:47.040 --> 21:47.500]  Thank you.
[21:47.500 --> 21:48.340]  Nice ramp car.
[21:49.160 --> 21:51.780]  I know this is a terrible angle.
[21:51.940 --> 21:52.240]  I'm sorry.
[21:52.720 --> 21:54.680]  It's okay.
[21:54.720 --> 21:57.500]  There we go.
[22:00.760 --> 22:03.060]  That was just a regular car.
[22:03.200 --> 22:04.300]  You got ramped.
[22:04.420 --> 22:06.240]  You got just cars.
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.180]  Where did that pull come from?
[22:08.840 --> 22:09.840]  Out of nowhere.
[22:13.360 --> 22:14.460]  Come on, man.
[22:14.460 --> 22:15.540]  Regular car.
[22:15.660 --> 22:18.960]  Why do you have to wait for us to hold your hand to go anywhere?
[22:19.100 --> 22:20.000]  Just fly.
[22:20.460 --> 22:22.300]  Oh, my God.
[22:22.380 --> 22:22.800]  Ramp car.
[22:23.960 --> 22:24.940]  Where are they?
[22:25.820 --> 22:26.720]  Hey, fellas.
[22:29.240 --> 22:30.020]  Special delivery.
[22:33.460 --> 22:33.900]  For you.
[22:34.160 --> 22:35.680]  Oh, no.
[22:36.760 --> 22:37.480]  This sign.
[22:37.680 --> 22:39.480]  That is the most inconvenient sign.
[22:40.360 --> 22:41.500]  Did you blow the sign up?
[22:41.500 --> 22:41.960]  There we go.
[22:42.420 --> 22:43.820]  It was in the way.
[22:47.300 --> 22:48.860]  Dude, ramp car rocks.
[22:49.040 --> 22:49.880]  That's for you.
[22:52.040 --> 22:52.720]  There's that.
[22:52.900 --> 22:53.920]  One more.
[22:54.300 --> 22:56.900]  And this is for you.
[22:57.160 --> 22:57.600]  Beautiful.
[22:58.040 --> 22:59.160]  That's definitely enough.
[22:59.880 --> 23:00.560]  We're on the move again.
[23:01.800 --> 23:02.340]  Tossed.
[23:05.250 --> 23:06.660]  You tossing these dudes off?
[23:06.740 --> 23:09.580]  These guys are getting tossed off big style.
[23:09.580 --> 23:11.340]  Damn, dude. Keep tossing.
[23:11.500 --> 23:12.920]  Ramp car is getting in there.
[23:13.160 --> 23:13.640]  Tossing.
[23:23.200 --> 23:24.180]  There's ramp car.
[23:24.600 --> 23:25.800]  Ramp car got excited.
[23:27.600 --> 23:28.960]  Listen, sometimes it's hard.
[23:31.020 --> 23:32.680]  This is fun as shit.
[23:33.000 --> 23:33.460]  Cyclist.
[23:35.740 --> 23:37.000]  Right behind you.
[23:37.000 --> 23:37.940]  I got you, buddy.
[23:39.800 --> 23:40.720]  Take him out.
[23:41.240 --> 23:42.520]  Nick, walk on.
[23:43.500 --> 23:44.320]  Roger that.
[23:45.120 --> 23:45.640]  Nice.
[23:47.540 --> 23:48.860]  Is that going to land on the gas station?
[23:49.660 --> 23:50.560]  Eh, not our problem.
[23:51.180 --> 23:52.620]  Oh my god, that's really close.
[23:53.220 --> 23:53.800]  Take him out.
[23:56.040 --> 23:56.980]  Watch out.
[23:57.700 --> 23:58.420]  That's fine.
[23:58.820 --> 23:59.560]  That's fine.
[24:00.840 --> 24:01.680]  That's fine.
[24:03.720 --> 24:04.300]  We're okay.
[24:04.300 --> 24:05.640]  There's a lot of stuff.
[24:05.760 --> 24:08.200]  A lot of stuff on fire around here, fellas.
[24:08.220 --> 24:09.460]  You got the pump, son.
[24:10.000 --> 24:10.840]  That's fine.
[24:12.080 --> 24:12.600]  Fortify.
[24:14.380 --> 24:14.900]  Oh!
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.880]  Over us.
[24:18.180 --> 24:18.700]  Andrew.
[24:21.920 --> 24:23.920]  I think Ulp is fine. Let's just follow Ulp.
[24:24.580 --> 24:25.460]  Ulp is good.
[24:25.640 --> 24:28.020]  Ulp? I'm just staying under him.
[24:30.520 --> 24:32.300]  Get some movement going with this guy.
[24:32.300 --> 24:34.220]  Is that a fire guy?
[24:35.440 --> 24:36.080]  Fire type?
[24:36.960 --> 24:37.900]  Yeah, fire type.
[24:39.220 --> 24:42.980]  Andrew, you really like science.
[24:44.320 --> 24:46.980]  It's not that I like him. I'm trying to follow him.
[24:47.060 --> 24:48.380]  He's going left. He's going right.
[24:48.480 --> 24:49.940]  He's not obeying the rules of the road.
[24:50.020 --> 24:50.820]  He's in the sky.
[24:51.180 --> 24:53.640]  Right, but he's mostly following the straight road.
[24:53.940 --> 24:56.820]  Nah, he's going left of it. He's going right of it.
[24:56.920 --> 24:58.160]  You can't read Ulp.
[24:59.880 --> 25:00.680]  I feel...
[25:00.680 --> 25:02.260]  What if we stopped at the airfield and stole,
[25:02.520 --> 25:03.500]  I don't know, a chopper?
[25:04.300 --> 25:04.960]  That'd be cool.
[25:05.620 --> 25:07.400]  He's getting real low. I think he might be landing.
[25:08.120 --> 25:09.440]  If we're on the way,
[25:10.040 --> 25:12.560]  and there's a chopper over there, I'll hop in it.
[25:12.680 --> 25:14.220]  I'll give up ramp car and just chopper him.
[25:14.220 --> 25:15.120]  I think we just passed it.
[25:15.700 --> 25:16.560]  Let's just keep going.
[25:19.840 --> 25:20.440]  Ramp car!
[25:21.080 --> 25:21.800]  Ramp car!
[25:23.340 --> 25:23.820]  Ramp car!
[25:27.480 --> 25:30.420]  I like that he was stuck in Gavin.
[25:32.720 --> 25:34.400]  Don't worry, he's upside down now.
[25:45.060 --> 25:46.680]  That was a great mission. Well done.
[25:46.820 --> 25:48.080]  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[25:49.920 --> 25:50.860]  Yeah, I shot some stuff.
[25:51.480 --> 25:52.060]  Ramp car.
[25:53.220 --> 25:54.940]  Dude, Andrew, you're making me nervous.
[26:03.960 --> 26:05.740]  Gavin, you remind me of my dog.
[26:06.760 --> 26:08.060]  The way you just keep going with your foot.
[26:08.540 --> 26:08.820]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:09.940 --> 26:12.840]  Hey, you trying to go somewhere? What if I'm trying to go there also at the same time?
[26:13.560 --> 26:14.680]  Oh, did I trip you?
[26:14.940 --> 26:15.360]  I don't care.
[26:15.780 --> 26:18.600]  I've hurt myself so many times not standing on Smee.
[26:19.260 --> 26:20.960]  Just like, he's under where my foot's going to land,
[26:20.980 --> 26:22.060]  so I have to do the splits.
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.280]  Spilled hot tea on myself doing it.
[26:28.140 --> 26:29.920]  We did it!
[26:30.240 --> 26:30.720]  Way to go.
[26:30.940 --> 26:32.800]  I'm trying to not step on him and not spill on him,
[26:32.860 --> 26:34.960]  so I'm just spilling all over myself
[26:34.960 --> 26:35.760]  and pulling a muscle.
[26:36.940 --> 26:38.640]  Wow, look at that. Nick with a platinum.
[26:39.260 --> 26:39.980]  Platty Nick.
[26:40.640 --> 26:41.160]  That's me, baby.
[26:44.060 --> 26:46.440]  I'm going to reward myself with a little nut bar.
[26:48.220 --> 26:49.860]  After tossing guys off, you're going nuts?
[26:49.860 --> 26:50.460]  After tossing.
[26:52.780 --> 26:54.560]  Getting a nut after some tossing.
[26:57.600 --> 26:59.980]  I look like nut and insane ramp car.
[27:01.040 --> 27:02.880]  That's what I'm talking about, baby.
[27:03.380 --> 27:04.700]  So we have two left?
[27:05.380 --> 27:07.180]  I believe two more setups, yeah.
[27:07.820 --> 27:08.280]  Whoa.
[27:09.180 --> 27:10.520]  And then it's the finale.
[27:11.660 --> 27:12.700]  Wow, finale.
[27:13.460 --> 27:15.320]  Intercept an arms dealer's air convoy
[27:15.320 --> 27:18.100]  and take down a heavy lift chopper to recover the barrage ATV.
[27:18.100 --> 27:18.680]  Ooh.
[27:19.600 --> 27:21.040]  Barrage ATV, sick.
[27:21.640 --> 27:23.020]  What are we intercepting in?
[27:23.200 --> 27:23.820]  Oh, cool.
[27:24.160 --> 27:26.120]  What are we dressing like?
[27:26.200 --> 27:28.360]  Ooh, I like mid tech.
[27:28.740 --> 27:30.240]  Yeah, mid tech is pretty cool.
[27:31.780 --> 27:35.960]  Yeah, I think maybe Bane.
[27:36.200 --> 27:36.980]  Oh, this is pretty cool.
[27:37.820 --> 27:38.320]  Alright, boys.
[27:39.760 --> 27:40.240]  Oh, yeah.
[27:41.600 --> 27:43.560]  Shit, that was my car.
[27:43.880 --> 27:44.200]  Shit.
[27:45.060 --> 27:46.480]  Shit, that was mine.
[27:46.600 --> 27:47.840]  I thought that was someone else's.
[27:48.080 --> 27:48.920]  Why'd you do that?
[27:50.200 --> 27:52.260]  I picked the vehicle that I didn't recognize.
[27:53.200 --> 27:54.280]  Let's get out of here, dude.
[27:55.260 --> 27:56.200]  Oh, this is real...
[27:57.260 --> 27:58.160]  What's his name's car?
[27:58.520 --> 27:59.300]  From Burn Notice.
[27:59.560 --> 27:59.900]  Hell yeah.
[28:03.040 --> 28:04.520]  The car I've taken
[28:04.520 --> 28:05.360]  has a flat tire.
[28:06.800 --> 28:08.020]  Geoffrey Donovan, right?
[28:08.960 --> 28:09.700]  That is his name.
[28:09.700 --> 28:11.440]  Yeah, this is...
[28:12.480 --> 28:13.860]  the last great show
[28:13.860 --> 28:16.240]  about an aging Burn Notice.
[28:18.280 --> 28:18.780]  Hell yeah.
[28:19.080 --> 28:19.960]  When you're a spy.
[28:22.060 --> 28:23.640]  I would get those
[28:23.640 --> 28:25.680]  times a lot, where it was just
[28:25.680 --> 28:26.860]  the guy saying, like,
[28:27.260 --> 28:29.220]  when you're a spy, here's a thing you have to do.
[28:29.340 --> 28:31.900]  And it was like, oh, these are like perfect little minute-long things.
[28:32.060 --> 28:33.340]  And then there's like a bunch of other show.
[28:33.460 --> 28:34.140]  I don't want to see that.
[28:35.060 --> 28:35.740]  Yeah, honestly.
[28:35.740 --> 28:37.220]  Should we make a bomb out of gum?
[28:38.240 --> 28:39.540]  And does he show you?
[28:39.700 --> 28:40.160]  Yeah, he does.
[28:41.700 --> 28:42.720]  It's pretty cool.
[28:43.320 --> 28:45.900]  Like, hey, if you have a burner phone, get ready to blow shit up.
[28:46.960 --> 28:48.040]  Here's how you make a gun
[28:48.660 --> 28:49.060]  untraceable.
[28:49.780 --> 28:50.540]  Alright, cool.
[28:52.020 --> 28:53.400]  You got a 3D printer, kid?
[28:55.460 --> 28:57.220]  Although that was before the 3D printer.
[28:57.940 --> 28:59.320]  Who is on a motorcycle?
[28:59.880 --> 29:00.480]  That'd be me.
[29:02.000 --> 29:02.960]  Oh, where are you?
[29:02.960 --> 29:04.980]  Behind you. Up the mountain.
[29:06.280 --> 29:07.020]  Oh, that was cool.
[29:07.860 --> 29:08.300]  Taking shortcuts.
[29:09.040 --> 29:10.060]  He is taking shortcuts.
[29:10.660 --> 29:11.400]  You're gonna need them.
[29:13.240 --> 29:14.360]  Oh, that sounded like a threat. Sorry.
[29:14.760 --> 29:16.120]  It was very threatening.
[29:16.540 --> 29:18.120]  It's not a threat. It's a promise.
[29:18.740 --> 29:21.000]  I just listen to this guy talk about how you
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.020]  make a gun untraceable, and then he's
[29:23.020 --> 29:24.880]  all threats
[29:24.880 --> 29:25.860]  and stuff at me.
[29:26.540 --> 29:27.300]  That's not a threat.
[29:29.040 --> 29:30.940]  Andrew, this three-wheel car sucks.
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.580]  Yeah, I'm sure it does.
[29:33.820 --> 29:34.880]  It's like a Monopoly
[29:34.880 --> 29:35.260]  mobile.
[29:36.440 --> 29:39.020]  I must have won it at the casino
[29:39.020 --> 29:39.700]  spinning the wheel.
[29:40.860 --> 29:42.160]  How do you know that you won it?
[29:42.780 --> 29:43.720]  Because I didn't buy it.
[29:43.980 --> 29:47.080]  You know which cars you've bought
[29:47.080 --> 29:47.500]  in this game?
[29:48.300 --> 29:49.800]  I haven't bought so many.
[29:53.240 --> 29:54.820]  It's alright. It's okay.
[29:55.800 --> 29:56.840]  You cleared it just in time.
[29:57.380 --> 29:59.080]  Alright, wait for your team at the
[29:59.080 --> 29:59.720]  game. Ah!
[30:03.040 --> 30:03.400]  Stupid.
[30:10.560 --> 30:12.260]  Gavin, hurry up!
[30:12.780 --> 30:13.880]  Alright, I got rid of the bike.
[30:16.960 --> 30:17.680]  My car!
[30:21.480 --> 30:22.120]  He's almost here.
[30:22.800 --> 30:24.620]  Let's see if we can pick off his tires from the mountain.
[30:25.600 --> 30:26.380]  That's a good idea.
[30:26.380 --> 30:27.040]  My car!
[30:28.840 --> 30:29.720]  Alright, let's see.
[30:30.600 --> 30:31.140]  Oh, he's here.
[30:32.360 --> 30:32.800]  Sup?
[30:35.460 --> 30:36.740]  Oh no, my wheels!
[30:40.200 --> 30:41.980]  Go to the... Nick, come back.
[30:42.940 --> 30:43.540]  Go to the ambush point.
[30:43.860 --> 30:46.620]  Right, right, right.
[30:47.860 --> 30:49.000]  It's fair I shut your tires.
[30:49.060 --> 30:51.740]  I forgot we're doing the game part of the game.
[30:52.460 --> 30:54.040]  Oh, a bike. What happened to it?
[30:54.040 --> 30:55.140]  It blew up.
[30:56.760 --> 30:58.600]  Are we going to wait again?
[31:02.860 --> 31:03.900]  Shoot enough.
[31:07.480 --> 31:08.160]  Sounds like a job.
[31:10.580 --> 31:11.880]  Here they come!
[31:13.080 --> 31:15.380]  Where? In front of us!
[31:15.580 --> 31:16.800]  Oh wow, there's a lot of them.
[31:18.960 --> 31:19.680]  We do?
[31:20.760 --> 31:22.080]  Destroy the cargo
[31:22.080 --> 31:22.740]  Hello, Bob.
[31:26.380 --> 31:28.160]  Are my bullets reaching it yet?
[31:28.900 --> 31:30.080]  How do we use
[31:30.080 --> 31:31.200]  explosive sniper rounds?
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.440]  I don't know, I have a sniper that has them.
[31:34.540 --> 31:35.560]  I don't know if they gave it to me.
[31:37.460 --> 31:38.340]  Eat shit!
[31:39.380 --> 31:40.040]  Oh boy.
[31:40.320 --> 31:40.760]  Got it!
[31:43.220 --> 31:44.320]  Alright, chopper's down.
[31:45.160 --> 31:46.140]  Can we take the car now?
[31:46.720 --> 31:47.440]  I'm going for it.
[31:48.360 --> 31:48.600]  Yep.
[31:49.260 --> 31:50.500]  Oh boy, oh boy.
[31:50.980 --> 31:51.420]  Oh!
[31:53.340 --> 31:53.780]  Wow!
[31:54.840 --> 31:55.600]  Hang on, hang on!
[31:56.640 --> 31:57.080]  Chopper!
[31:59.220 --> 32:00.480]  That's one more boy missing.
[32:00.920 --> 32:01.600]  Hurry up!
[32:04.620 --> 32:05.600]  Where do I go in?
[32:06.780 --> 32:07.760]  Get into the car!
[32:08.900 --> 32:10.240]  Where do I go in?
[32:10.720 --> 32:12.660]  Where do I go in? I don't know where the things are.
[32:12.940 --> 32:14.100]  What are you doing?
[32:14.280 --> 32:16.060]  I'm coming down the mountain!
[32:16.060 --> 32:18.100]  Oh, this is so dizzying.
[32:18.220 --> 32:19.180]  Oh Jesus.
[32:19.600 --> 32:20.440]  Oh my God.
[32:21.060 --> 32:22.680]  Just follow the road!
[32:24.660 --> 32:26.020]  I'm looking backwards
[32:26.020 --> 32:28.120]  so I don't have any context for where we're
[32:28.120 --> 32:29.180]  going, it's the worst.
[32:30.680 --> 32:32.360]  Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[32:36.200 --> 32:37.040]  Are you trying to hit him?
[32:37.860 --> 32:39.100]  Wow, that was awesome.
[32:40.180 --> 32:41.720]  Somebody shoot the chopper!
[32:41.720 --> 32:43.400]  Is it hard to shoot or not?
[32:48.100 --> 32:49.220]  Holy shit.
[32:49.940 --> 32:52.560]  Oh my God.
[32:52.660 --> 32:55.000]  That was so scary, I crashed into a sign.
[32:55.900 --> 32:56.860]  I get that.
[33:00.040 --> 33:01.960]  Whoever's in the front is getting lit up.
[33:02.000 --> 33:03.040]  Oh my God!
[33:07.160 --> 33:08.940]  We're going off the road.
[33:08.940 --> 33:09.840]  Cuts Gavin!
[33:12.480 --> 33:14.200]  Watch out for the trees!
[33:18.720 --> 33:19.660]  Chopper! Chopper!
[33:19.880 --> 33:22.980]  I can't aim that high.
[33:24.880 --> 33:28.240]  I'm getting shot!
[33:28.620 --> 33:29.700]  We're on a side!
[33:30.220 --> 33:31.440]  Healing! Snacks!
[33:34.580 --> 33:35.940]  Come on, hit it!
[33:35.940 --> 33:36.200]  Come on!
[33:38.020 --> 33:39.260]  Got it!
[33:40.660 --> 33:41.100]  Nice!
[33:44.320 --> 33:45.700]  Now we're cooking.
[33:46.760 --> 33:47.960]  Good job, Gavin.
[33:49.460 --> 33:51.700]  This is fucking crazy.
[33:52.780 --> 33:53.660]  Roadblock!
[33:54.040 --> 33:54.380]  Got him!
[33:57.560 --> 33:58.660]  Got him!
[33:59.100 --> 34:00.260]  Nice shooting!
[34:00.540 --> 34:02.500]  They put this backwards.
[34:02.500 --> 34:03.860]  Got him!
[34:03.960 --> 34:06.420]  I have a grenade launcher, but it's in the back.
[34:06.500 --> 34:07.660]  Oh no!
[34:08.200 --> 34:09.360]  What happened?
[34:10.900 --> 34:12.260]  Stop moving!
[34:12.780 --> 34:13.100]  Stop!
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.460]  They're getting tossed!
[34:15.760 --> 34:17.240]  God damn it, son!
[34:18.520 --> 34:20.100]  You're running me over!
[34:20.380 --> 34:21.020]  Stop moving!
[34:22.420 --> 34:22.700]  Gavin!
[34:24.220 --> 34:25.660]  We good?
[34:27.020 --> 34:28.460]  Jesus Christ!
[34:28.580 --> 34:29.860]  That was scary as shit!
[34:31.140 --> 34:32.400]  Stay on the road!
[34:32.620 --> 34:33.300]  Where are you going?
[34:33.760 --> 34:34.420]  He's on the road!
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.200]  Where are you going?
[34:41.280 --> 34:43.460]  That one was dumb. I shouldn't have done that.
[34:43.580 --> 34:44.580]  I'd like to apologize.
[34:45.020 --> 34:46.160]  These guns are great.
[34:46.820 --> 34:47.500]  That wasn't a gun.
[34:51.080 --> 34:53.200]  That's what I call an explosive device.
[34:56.400 --> 34:58.560]  Gavin, you've been driving like a pro this whole time.
[34:58.560 --> 34:59.320]  Except when you hit sign.
[34:59.440 --> 35:03.000]  The sign was a low point, but there's a big explosion.
[35:03.720 --> 35:05.600]  Yeah, but you did it twice.
[35:06.960 --> 35:07.640]  So...
[35:08.380 --> 35:09.020]  Low points.
[35:10.040 --> 35:11.820]  I think we got it here.
[35:12.420 --> 35:12.660]  Wow!
[35:13.980 --> 35:15.480]  Should we do a celebratory backflip?
[35:15.680 --> 35:16.180]  No!
[35:18.700 --> 35:19.380]  Backflip!
[35:20.140 --> 35:21.100]  Oh, they're dead.
[35:25.180 --> 35:25.860]  Sorry.
[35:30.500 --> 35:31.860]  Come back in!
[35:33.400 --> 35:35.920]  I watched Andrew just tumble.
[35:36.280 --> 35:37.440]  I was going to yell,
[35:37.660 --> 35:39.100]  but it was pointless.
[35:39.340 --> 35:40.660]  Now we're doing it, I guess.
[35:41.500 --> 35:42.060]  Here we go!
[35:44.500 --> 35:46.180]  Don't let the plane take off!
[35:46.320 --> 35:47.200]  Don't let the plane take off!
[35:49.500 --> 35:49.940]  Intercept!
[35:54.290 --> 35:56.110]  I can't do shit, because my gun's back.
[35:58.950 --> 36:00.390]  Get away from it!
[36:00.390 --> 36:01.590]  Oh, we're stuck!
[36:01.790 --> 36:02.490]  We're in the plane?
[36:03.270 --> 36:04.370]  I've wedged it.
[36:05.430 --> 36:06.450]  It's fine.
[36:07.610 --> 36:09.950]  We've lost the power situation here.
[36:10.210 --> 36:10.830]  It's stuck.
[36:11.390 --> 36:11.950]  Gavin, drive!
[36:13.330 --> 36:14.250]  There we go.
[36:15.490 --> 36:16.250]  Alright, here we go.
[36:19.070 --> 36:19.670]  Helicopters.
[36:20.890 --> 36:22.470]  I can't do anything.
[36:22.690 --> 36:23.170]  Got it!
[36:24.610 --> 36:26.110]  Gavin, can you turn us sideways?
[36:27.010 --> 36:27.190]  Yeah.
[36:28.190 --> 36:29.410]  Did you drive forward?
[36:29.970 --> 36:30.090]  Yeah.
[36:30.990 --> 36:32.930]  Wouldn't get too close, but yeah.
[36:34.090 --> 36:35.030]  Oh, boys!
[36:35.970 --> 36:36.850]  No, no, no!
[36:36.950 --> 36:37.710]  We're way too close!
[36:38.010 --> 36:42.430]  I wouldn't get too close.
[36:42.430 --> 36:43.470]  What are you doing?
[36:44.290 --> 36:46.170]  Oh, Gavin, you killed us.
[36:49.090 --> 36:50.650]  I wouldn't get too close.
[36:51.330 --> 36:52.590]  Oh, my God.
[36:52.650 --> 36:54.530]  I wouldn't get too close.
[36:55.650 --> 36:56.730]  Close to what?
[36:56.930 --> 36:59.330]  Hey, guys, I wouldn't get too close.
[37:00.770 --> 37:02.590]  He said, I wouldn't get too close.
[37:02.710 --> 37:04.050]  And you said, well, we'll get close, dude.
[37:04.190 --> 37:05.570]  Dumb fuck.
[37:06.510 --> 37:08.530]  There was other stuff.
[37:09.510 --> 37:10.810]  What the fuck
[37:10.810 --> 37:12.250]  are you talking about?
[37:12.370 --> 37:14.590]  Gavin drove us into explosive barrels.
[37:15.970 --> 37:19.610]  Hey, hey, hey.
[37:20.050 --> 37:20.650]  Apologize.
[37:20.650 --> 37:21.450]  I'm sorry.
[37:23.450 --> 37:24.650]  Apology barely accepted.
[37:25.110 --> 37:26.870]  I was quick with the apology, though, weren't I?
[37:27.430 --> 37:28.130]  Yeah, you were.
[37:28.190 --> 37:29.710]  Well, yeah, because you needed to do it.
[37:30.090 --> 37:31.470]  You know what? Someone else could drive if they want.
[37:32.090 --> 37:32.910]  Nope, you got it.
[37:33.210 --> 37:34.770]  Oh, no!
[37:36.410 --> 37:36.770]  What?
[37:37.970 --> 37:40.110]  I just saw where we were.
[37:42.530 --> 37:44.450]  I wouldn't get too close.
[37:46.530 --> 37:47.870]  Oh, no, I'm driving.
[37:47.870 --> 37:49.910]  Why did I get in the shit turret again?
[37:50.010 --> 37:50.670]  No, I got it. It's alright.
[37:50.790 --> 37:54.410]  I wouldn't want to be in a turret that the turret behind it can shoot.
[37:56.190 --> 37:57.950]  The problem with the turrets is
[37:57.950 --> 37:58.730]  try to aim up.
[37:59.750 --> 38:00.250]  Yeah, I know.
[38:01.570 --> 38:02.930]  There is not a lot of height.
[38:05.230 --> 38:07.190]  Nick, what were you doing as the passenger?
[38:08.170 --> 38:08.930]  Blowing shit up.
[38:09.250 --> 38:10.130]  What were you using?
[38:11.570 --> 38:12.370]  Sticky bombs.
[38:13.250 --> 38:14.310]  Is that what killed us?
[38:14.870 --> 38:15.310]  No.
[38:16.010 --> 38:18.370]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[38:18.510 --> 38:19.710]  Are you for real?
[38:20.050 --> 38:21.390]  I am not your Greg card, man.
[38:21.390 --> 38:22.510]  Are you fucking for real?
[38:22.930 --> 38:25.470]  What, Nick just got shot? What was the actual thing?
[38:25.510 --> 38:27.130]  You got shot! What are you talking about?
[38:27.330 --> 38:29.510]  Were your eyes closed?
[38:29.910 --> 38:31.570]  I didn't die. Did I die?
[38:31.710 --> 38:33.110]  Yes, you and Eric both died.
[38:33.290 --> 38:34.950]  Oh, my God.
[38:35.070 --> 38:37.630]  I landed back on it. I got kicked out
[38:37.630 --> 38:39.330]  and then landed back on the top.
[38:40.010 --> 38:40.490]  That was awesome.
[38:40.490 --> 38:40.990]  Oh, my God.
[38:41.410 --> 38:44.010]  Why am I punching a map?
[38:45.750 --> 38:46.510]  You are getting shit
[38:46.510 --> 38:47.170]  turned now, Gavin.
[38:47.350 --> 38:49.850]  Get in!
[38:50.430 --> 38:50.650]  Okay.
[38:53.830 --> 38:54.270]  Gavin.
[38:54.710 --> 38:54.830]  Yeah.
[38:57.750 --> 38:59.170]  What was that?
[39:01.030 --> 39:01.970]  Are you
[39:02.910 --> 39:04.010]  awake, Gavin?
[39:04.850 --> 39:06.090]  What is the issue?
[39:06.190 --> 39:06.950]  Let's talk about it.
[39:07.910 --> 39:08.870]  I feel
[39:08.870 --> 39:10.130]  like you don't know
[39:10.810 --> 39:12.190]  why we are...
[39:12.190 --> 39:13.730]  what's going on.
[39:15.050 --> 39:16.930]  You don't understand
[39:16.930 --> 39:18.610]  why the last time we died,
[39:18.710 --> 39:19.230]  we died.
[39:20.230 --> 39:21.310]  He's rabbiting.
[39:21.730 --> 39:25.090]  I thought Nick got shot.
[39:26.230 --> 39:26.910]  We all
[39:26.910 --> 39:28.770]  got shot. You drove us into the middle
[39:28.770 --> 39:29.550]  of the thing.
[39:29.890 --> 39:31.210]  All four of us died?
[39:31.870 --> 39:34.230]  We all got lit up.
[39:34.230 --> 39:36.290]  I died, you died
[39:36.290 --> 39:36.850]  for sure.
[39:37.430 --> 39:39.870]  Gavin, you killed us.
[39:42.690 --> 39:43.950]  You're not okay.
[39:44.090 --> 39:45.270]  There's something wrong with you, I think.
[39:46.010 --> 39:47.130]  Eric, Gavin, die.
[39:47.710 --> 39:49.330]  What is editing?
[39:50.550 --> 39:51.410]  Oh, my God.
[39:51.670 --> 39:52.710]  We'll find out, won't we?
[39:53.510 --> 39:54.490]  I'm just like
[39:56.490 --> 39:57.010]  floored.
[40:00.190 --> 40:01.230]  You're like,
[40:01.230 --> 40:01.610]  what?
[40:02.950 --> 40:04.910]  Oh, my God.
[40:05.810 --> 40:07.510]  Kept you in on my screen.
[40:07.750 --> 40:09.470]  I don't think I tipped you guys as many times
[40:09.470 --> 40:09.810]  as this.
[40:10.190 --> 40:13.150]  What? I don't think I
[40:13.150 --> 40:14.610]  tipped you guys as many times as this.
[40:14.870 --> 40:15.130]  What?
[40:15.770 --> 40:18.550]  Oh, these are explosive?
[40:19.470 --> 40:19.730]  What are?
[40:20.610 --> 40:21.170]  What?
[40:22.710 --> 40:24.490]  Their grenades, they suck.
[40:25.630 --> 40:26.970]  Yeah, they're a little...
[40:26.970 --> 40:29.190]  The enemies are never in a position.
[40:31.370 --> 40:33.490]  Dear God, I'm swung to the front.
[40:39.170 --> 40:41.430]  Alright, there goes
[40:41.430 --> 40:43.230]  a husk.
[40:43.750 --> 40:44.150]  Okay.
[40:45.550 --> 40:46.330]  Things are bad.
[40:49.290 --> 40:51.490]  My goal is to shoot the chopper out of the sky with this.
[40:51.530 --> 40:53.210]  Is there like a quick eat
[40:53.210 --> 40:54.990]  or anything button while we're driving or no?
[40:54.990 --> 40:58.290]  Oh, my God.
[40:58.290 --> 41:00.750]  Oh, my God.
[41:00.810 --> 41:01.730]  I'm in front now.
[41:01.890 --> 41:03.510]  Did I shoot the chopper down?
[41:04.850 --> 41:04.970]  Bridge.
[41:06.710 --> 41:07.390]  Oh, God.
[41:07.950 --> 41:08.750]  Oh, God.
[41:11.350 --> 41:12.230]  Tree for cover.
[41:14.210 --> 41:14.970]  What happened?
[41:15.730 --> 41:17.030]  I think they shot us.
[41:17.510 --> 41:18.670]  I don't think that was any of our fault.
[41:19.530 --> 41:20.250]  I said Eric died.
[41:21.050 --> 41:22.230]  We all died.
[41:22.230 --> 41:23.390]  The vehicle exploded.
[41:26.110 --> 41:28.270]  The finger pointing here is like
[41:28.270 --> 41:30.290]  absurd. It's insane.
[41:30.830 --> 41:31.510]  Are you me?
[41:31.710 --> 41:33.570]  The vehicle exploded.
[41:35.470 --> 41:36.370]  That's the message
[41:36.370 --> 41:37.430]  it said on the end.
[41:40.850 --> 41:41.810]  Is there no...
[41:41.810 --> 41:44.250]  There's like no quick armor, quick eat. You have to go into like the select
[41:44.250 --> 41:44.530]  menu?
[41:46.110 --> 41:47.150]  Fucking bomber.
[41:48.790 --> 41:49.630]  Pretty ass.
[41:50.190 --> 41:51.670]  I love Gavin so much.
[41:51.790 --> 41:53.770]  There's no time more where I want to just fucking
[41:53.770 --> 41:55.190]  swirly his ass
[41:55.190 --> 41:56.630]  than when we're playing GTA.
[41:57.070 --> 41:58.550]  It's insane.
[41:59.110 --> 42:00.210]  How does it keep happening?
[42:01.550 --> 42:02.730]  I'm on the back one, I guess.
[42:04.790 --> 42:05.170]  Alright, Gavin.
[42:05.310 --> 42:07.610]  We're back in our original position except for Eric
[42:07.610 --> 42:08.830]  and Andrew.
[42:09.330 --> 42:11.630]  So, wait. You want to swirly me because of the original time
[42:11.630 --> 42:11.930]  we died?
[42:12.930 --> 42:13.950]  Just all of it.
[42:14.270 --> 42:16.170]  What else have I done?
[42:16.170 --> 42:17.390]  All of it.
[42:17.630 --> 42:19.250]  Well, you keep questioning shit.
[42:21.670 --> 42:22.450]  Andrew, this thing
[42:22.450 --> 42:23.250]  only shoots grenades?
[42:23.890 --> 42:25.730]  Wow, that sucks.
[42:25.910 --> 42:26.950]  It's real bad.
[42:27.590 --> 42:28.810]  You can't even hit choppers.
[42:28.910 --> 42:32.270]  I thought when I was shooting, when I was the turret,
[42:32.410 --> 42:34.170]  I'm like, okay, Andrew, it's me and Andrew.
[42:34.490 --> 42:35.150]  Nope, we're good.
[42:36.190 --> 42:37.930]  It's just grenades.
[42:38.090 --> 42:39.530]  That's brutal, dude.
[42:39.990 --> 42:42.230]  Also, imagine that Gavin's driving and you're going
[42:42.230 --> 42:44.210]  over every mountain and you can't make
[42:44.210 --> 42:46.370]  sense of anything as far as where you're going.
[42:46.430 --> 42:48.350]  Now, I will say, I don't have to
[42:48.350 --> 42:48.810]  imagine.
[42:49.630 --> 42:51.470]  I'm living it at the moment.
[42:51.710 --> 42:52.970]  I'm on the roads!
[42:53.390 --> 42:55.570]  Okay, I'm a little off the road now.
[42:56.710 --> 42:58.030]  A little bit off.
[42:58.490 --> 42:59.290]  A little bit.
[42:59.690 --> 43:00.190]  Just slightly.
[43:02.010 --> 43:02.510]  Chopper.
[43:03.770 --> 43:05.490]  Wow, nice shot.
[43:07.130 --> 43:07.850]  Another chopper.
[43:09.610 --> 43:11.170]  That one's coming in real low.
[43:11.170 --> 43:13.110]  This might be the most cinematic heist yet.
[43:14.730 --> 43:15.330]  Pretty good.
[43:15.390 --> 43:17.330]  Oh my god, we're getting peppered.
[43:17.410 --> 43:18.270]  Yeah, this is bad.
[43:18.690 --> 43:21.130]  Dude, that guy's coming in low. He's right above us.
[43:21.410 --> 43:23.170]  Yeah, you can't look up that high
[43:23.170 --> 43:24.130]  on these turrets.
[43:24.650 --> 43:25.970]  Got him!
[43:26.090 --> 43:26.870]  I got him!
[43:27.470 --> 43:29.670]  I got him with a sticky bomb.
[43:33.870 --> 43:36.530]  I got the chopper with a sticky bomb.
[43:36.610 --> 43:37.210]  That was awesome.
[43:37.210 --> 43:37.830]  Did you really?
[43:38.590 --> 43:39.670]  Nice, Nick.
[43:46.850 --> 43:47.450]  Alright.
[43:51.050 --> 43:54.290]  Just arm out the window with the sticky bomb in your hand.
[43:55.890 --> 43:57.390]  To the graveyard!
[43:59.130 --> 43:59.930]  Teach him!
[44:02.830 --> 44:04.370]  You can bury him right there.
[44:05.190 --> 44:05.910]  Fuck that.
[44:07.030 --> 44:07.330]  Uh oh.
[44:08.410 --> 44:09.130]  I got him.
[44:09.590 --> 44:09.990]  Wow.
[44:11.350 --> 44:12.790]  Nobody look over the bridge.
[44:13.010 --> 44:14.550]  Nobody's allowed to look over the bridge.
[44:15.470 --> 44:16.270]  This is...
[44:16.270 --> 44:19.450]  When you're on the back turret, this is a Universal Studios ride.
[44:19.510 --> 44:20.730]  Watch out for the Billy Grose Gruff.
[44:20.910 --> 44:21.550]  What happened?
[44:22.270 --> 44:24.250]  How did you do that?
[44:24.490 --> 44:26.330]  I don't know. I got, like, kicked back.
[44:27.470 --> 44:29.410]  Oh, are you not driving?
[44:29.610 --> 44:30.510]  No, I've never driven.
[44:31.010 --> 44:32.050]  Andrew's driving, isn't he?
[44:32.450 --> 44:32.790]  I'm driving.
[44:34.170 --> 44:35.670]  You can't tell from the...
[44:35.670 --> 44:37.050]  Oops, oops, oops.
[44:41.610 --> 44:44.630]  I guess I should have guessed when we weren't flying over mountaintops, though.
[44:44.730 --> 44:45.030]  There you go.
[44:45.130 --> 44:45.510]  It's true.
[44:46.970 --> 44:47.790]  I got him.
[44:48.390 --> 44:49.070]  Great shot.
[44:52.550 --> 44:53.590]  Okay, here we go.
[44:53.690 --> 44:54.170]  That's for you.
[44:54.570 --> 44:57.170]  Oh my God.
[44:57.670 --> 44:59.070]  We're just raiding death.
[44:59.070 --> 45:01.790]  Okay, when you do this airfield coming up,
[45:01.910 --> 45:03.310]  just sort of get us sideways.
[45:03.310 --> 45:05.250]  Hey, we have to...
[45:05.250 --> 45:06.490]  Gavin, you're on the turret, right?
[45:06.710 --> 45:09.190]  Just blast the whole time.
[45:09.390 --> 45:10.490]  Blast the plane.
[45:11.030 --> 45:12.630]  Yeah, you can also just stop it.
[45:12.810 --> 45:13.510]  Drive in front of it.
[45:14.330 --> 45:14.830]  Oh, can you?
[45:15.450 --> 45:15.710]  Yeah.
[45:17.790 --> 45:18.610]  Genuine parts.
[45:20.390 --> 45:21.090]  Where are we going?
[45:22.650 --> 45:24.470]  We went a little far, but we're turning.
[45:25.930 --> 45:26.850]  Almost at the airfield.
[45:26.850 --> 45:27.190]  Airfield.
[45:28.070 --> 45:28.690]  Airford.
[45:30.130 --> 45:31.690]  Here comes the airfield.
[45:33.690 --> 45:34.310]  Airford.
[45:35.310 --> 45:36.430]  Where's the airford?
[45:36.970 --> 45:37.770]  It's on the left one.
[45:38.490 --> 45:39.610]  Let's do it.
[45:41.410 --> 45:41.830]  Whoa!
[45:43.130 --> 45:43.750]  Oh!
[45:44.690 --> 45:45.250]  Andrew.
[45:45.870 --> 45:48.210]  That was on me. Fired the plane.
[45:48.870 --> 45:50.630]  We're not in the turrets.
[45:51.670 --> 45:52.410]  I got it.
[45:52.650 --> 45:54.210]  Oh, Andrew, we're toast.
[45:54.210 --> 45:55.430]  I got it. Hold on. No, we got it.
[45:55.450 --> 45:56.970]  Just shoot it with rockets.
[45:57.450 --> 45:59.910]  Alright, let's snipe those fools.
[46:00.650 --> 46:01.330]  Wait, let me in.
[46:02.150 --> 46:03.110]  Get in the turret.
[46:05.550 --> 46:06.350]  Helicopter coming up.
[46:06.950 --> 46:08.490]  Can you face us sideways on this thing?
[46:08.610 --> 46:10.010]  Or get closer and face us sideways?
[46:14.560 --> 46:15.480]  I'll get the chopper.
[46:16.060 --> 46:16.500]  There we go.
[46:16.960 --> 46:17.820]  Oh, nice shot.
[46:18.100 --> 46:21.020]  You rolled it right in front of the plane and stuff.
[46:23.400 --> 46:23.980]  Uh-oh.
[46:23.980 --> 46:25.100]  Nope, nope, this ain't working.
[46:25.380 --> 46:26.000]  Oh, boys.
[46:27.480 --> 46:28.100]  What's the matter?
[46:28.680 --> 46:29.380]  Why'd you get out?
[46:29.600 --> 46:31.480]  Because I'm almost dead.
[46:33.260 --> 46:34.500]  Right in front, Gavin.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.580]  I can just snipe them from here.
[46:44.230 --> 46:45.870]  Oh, you guys scared the hell out of me.
[46:45.950 --> 46:47.030]  I thought you were another group.
[46:48.270 --> 46:48.850]  Can I get closer?
[46:51.110 --> 46:52.950]  Is that a barrel that will explode?
[46:53.970 --> 46:54.810]  Yes, it is!
[46:55.490 --> 46:56.450]  Hell yeah.
[47:00.150 --> 47:02.490]  This is quite far from the action.
[47:03.390 --> 47:05.130]  Yeah, well...
[47:05.130 --> 47:06.030]  They're sniping.
[47:06.710 --> 47:09.450]  I don't want to do the mission again.
[47:24.790 --> 47:26.690]  You feeling good about this?
[47:27.290 --> 47:27.870]  Getting your angles?
[47:30.210 --> 47:31.270]  Oh, you dropped.
[47:31.270 --> 47:32.450]  You left?
[47:40.300 --> 47:44.000]  You just have to shoot them high.
[47:46.780 --> 47:47.720]  There we go.
[47:49.800 --> 47:51.300]  Yeah, they're just outside the hangar.
[47:53.500 --> 47:55.660]  I'm just going to deliver this to the drop-off.
[47:56.240 --> 47:57.240]  Hell yeah, do it.
[48:01.900 --> 48:03.740]  Keep me covered, Gavin!
[48:06.720 --> 48:07.620]  Oh, shit.
[48:10.800 --> 48:11.420]  Oh, boy.
[48:11.600 --> 48:11.940]  Oh, boy.
[48:13.240 --> 48:14.440]  What's going on?
[48:15.400 --> 48:16.840]  Enemies and choppers.
[48:17.980 --> 48:18.940]  Is there a chopper here?
[48:18.940 --> 48:21.500]  I just fucking died. There was one guy.
[48:25.120 --> 48:25.920]  Say you're sorry.
[48:27.960 --> 48:29.580]  Why did you get so quiet all of a sudden?
[48:30.220 --> 48:30.740]  There we go.
[48:31.320 --> 48:33.320]  Because I pounded my desk.
[48:34.500 --> 48:36.100]  Turned the corner and just got blasted.
[48:36.720 --> 48:38.160]  That fucking sucks. I'm sorry.
[48:38.160 --> 48:39.600]  That was fucking awful.
[48:39.760 --> 48:41.840]  Well, we made it further, so maybe it'll just put us here.
[48:42.520 --> 48:43.900]  Oh, don't say that.
[48:45.080 --> 48:45.560]  Please.
[48:46.440 --> 48:47.280]  Please don't.
[48:47.840 --> 48:48.780]  Just go straight down.
[48:50.120 --> 48:51.080]  We checkpointed.
[48:51.520 --> 48:53.920]  God, that fucking sucked.
[48:54.600 --> 48:56.060]  Turn the corner, just boom.
[48:56.560 --> 48:57.160]  Were you on foot?
[48:57.960 --> 48:58.220]  Yeah.
[49:00.180 --> 49:02.020]  I didn't know where you guys went.
[49:02.140 --> 49:03.480]  I thought we were still clearing out the airfield.
[49:04.560 --> 49:06.540]  I said, gotta deliver this thing.
[49:06.540 --> 49:08.300]  And then you said go, so I just started driving.
[49:08.300 --> 49:10.780]  The game said everything you needed to hear and so did Andrew.
[49:14.080 --> 49:14.800]  You know...
[49:14.800 --> 49:15.420]  Yeah.
[49:16.440 --> 49:16.940]  Here we go.
[49:18.320 --> 49:19.760]  I call that insurance policy.
[49:23.420 --> 49:24.580]  That's my car, what am I doing?
[49:24.720 --> 49:25.560]  Fuck that, no.
[49:26.000 --> 49:26.400]  Oh no!
[49:30.240 --> 49:32.200]  Damn it, I didn't get to the pipe bomb fast enough.
[49:32.200 --> 49:34.260]  See, now that I'm driving again, we can have the editor cut
[49:34.260 --> 49:36.380]  from when we blew up the plane on my attempt
[49:36.380 --> 49:37.060]  to right now.
[49:38.180 --> 49:39.340]  It's true, it's true.
[49:43.200 --> 49:44.900]  Are we gonna have the editor leave this part in?
[49:47.280 --> 49:49.580]  We can do it on the second attempt of this bit.
[49:57.230 --> 49:59.050]  You're throwing shit right by us.
[50:00.210 --> 50:00.830]  Who, me?
[50:01.150 --> 50:02.110]  Whoever's chucking.
[50:02.950 --> 50:05.450]  I have grenades in the back, I'm shooting grenades backwards.
[50:07.250 --> 50:08.210]  I'm throwing stuff.
[50:08.210 --> 50:09.790]  Wait, who am I?
[50:09.870 --> 50:10.870]  Are you throwing stuff?
[50:11.870 --> 50:13.150]  Oh my god.
[50:13.590 --> 50:14.370]  Double explosives.
[50:14.850 --> 50:15.570]  They're sticky bombs.
[50:15.730 --> 50:19.890]  I like that you said, come on.
[50:19.970 --> 50:20.770]  Bird's up to the left.
[50:22.970 --> 50:23.410]  Bird's!
[50:24.810 --> 50:25.370]  Don't come!
[50:27.570 --> 50:29.570]  It's too far, the other bird's too far.
[50:29.730 --> 50:31.450]  That bird is just floating on my screen.
[50:31.530 --> 50:32.350]  It's just up in the air.
[50:32.930 --> 50:34.410]  Can't do nothing about that bird.
[50:41.400 --> 50:43.840]  I like the birds.
[50:49.080 --> 50:52.660]  I'm surprised it checkpointed us, considering we're this close to the thing!
[50:54.100 --> 50:56.060]  I remember getting stuck in this before.
[51:01.780 --> 51:03.220]  Oh, we're like right there. Cool.
[51:07.900 --> 51:09.160]  We made it!
[51:09.160 --> 51:09.920]  Oh!
[51:11.460 --> 51:12.120]  That was...
[51:13.220 --> 51:14.620]  We're not in the drop, we're not.
[51:14.940 --> 51:15.760]  Yeah, you gotta go back.
[51:17.560 --> 51:18.860]  I guess I'm driving now.
[51:23.010 --> 51:24.810]  I mean, I pretty much did that.
[51:25.390 --> 51:26.470]  No, I don't think you did.
[51:26.750 --> 51:27.470]  Good job, Nick!
[51:29.230 --> 51:30.030]  Great driving!
[51:31.130 --> 51:32.130]  I thought it said fail.
[51:32.870 --> 51:33.470]  Way to go, boys.
[51:35.190 --> 51:36.630]  Oh, Platinum Andrew, that's what they call him.
[51:36.850 --> 51:37.470]  Platinum Patton.
[51:38.890 --> 51:40.490]  That's way better than Platinum Andrew, yeah.
[51:40.570 --> 51:42.150]  I like it. Alliteration's good.
[51:42.690 --> 51:44.170]  I need to buy body armor.
[51:44.490 --> 51:45.770]  I'm out. I need it.
[51:46.050 --> 51:48.390]  You wanna end this part, buy body armor, and then do the next one?
[51:49.190 --> 51:49.550]  Sure!
[51:49.730 --> 51:50.890]  You know what? I do.
[51:51.550 --> 51:52.190]  You sold me.
[51:52.750 --> 51:54.570]  The Ideas Guy Gavin, that's what we call him.
[51:54.770 --> 51:55.550]  I had an idea once.
[51:56.390 --> 51:57.110]  What was your idea?
[51:59.070 --> 51:59.830]  See you next time.
[52:02.970 --> 52:04.150]  Good job, Nick, you nailed it.
[52:04.150 --> 52:05.250]  Check out the Patreon.
[52:05.750 --> 52:07.090]  Do all sorts of stuff.
[52:07.310 --> 52:08.370]  Oh my god.
[52:11.850 --> 52:12.810]  Regulation pod.
[52:13.610 --> 52:14.590]  Listen to that.
[52:15.270 --> 52:16.770]  Anything else you wanna say, Nick?
[52:16.830 --> 52:17.930]  Or you nailed it?
[52:19.830 --> 52:20.950]  He nailed it, we're good.
[52:21.310 --> 52:22.230]  Talk to you soon!
[52:22.470 --> 52:23.710]  Love you, bye!
[52:24.130 --> 52:25.190]  We'll see you next time, bye!
[52:25.330 --> 52:25.810]  Shut it down.
