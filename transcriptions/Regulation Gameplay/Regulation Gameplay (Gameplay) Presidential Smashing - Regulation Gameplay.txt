[00:00.000 --> 00:06.300]  Hello and welcome to a video in which we determine who is genuinely the president of our company via Smash Brothers.
[00:06.920 --> 00:14.960]  I- I- I- I hate this so much. This could have been done at 9pm last night.
[00:15.100 --> 00:22.980]  Eric wanted to quickly knock this out over Slack and as soon as Andrew and Geoff started suggesting other stuff, I watched him die on the inside over text.
[00:23.160 --> 00:28.260]  So, yeah, it's cool. So 14 fucking hours later, we're doing this.
[00:28.260 --> 00:34.300]  A thing where we're going to let Smash Brothers determine who's the president and who's the secretary of our new company.
[00:34.960 --> 00:38.620]  Don't tell our lawyer about this, our brand new lawyer.
[00:39.180 --> 00:43.320]  Take it back to last night at 9pm or so, you texted us and you said,
[00:43.440 --> 00:49.260]  Hey, we need a president and we need a secretary to be designated for the new company.
[00:49.760 --> 00:53.940]  These- these have no additional responsibility. They are in name only.
[00:53.940 --> 01:02.040]  It literally does not matter who of the five of us have it. We just need to assign these titles to two of us who wants it.
[01:02.340 --> 01:06.860]  And I thought, instead of us fighting over nonsense, let's let Chance handle it.
[01:07.080 --> 01:09.540]  I don't understand fighting over nonsense. There's no fight.
[01:10.280 --> 01:11.940]  Well, I don't think anyone wants these roles.
[01:12.140 --> 01:14.720]  Yeah, like fighting over who has to take it, right?
[01:15.080 --> 01:20.960]  And so I thought, let's have the- let's do the randomizer like we do to- for, uh, to determine draft order.
[01:20.960 --> 01:24.280]  And then Andrew had a brilliant idea.
[01:25.360 --> 01:26.100]  Which is this.
[01:27.040 --> 01:29.320]  We're gonna smash it up. We're each gonna pick a character.
[01:29.760 --> 01:32.840]  Yeah, I texted Gavin about this. He did not reply, understandably.
[01:33.140 --> 01:33.600]  It's 2am.
[01:33.660 --> 01:34.820]  Sorry, I was working.
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.240]  But, uh, you know, when you're taking one of your disappointing shits, you could have thrown a response.
[01:40.640 --> 01:42.080]  Either way, but that's fine.
[01:42.380 --> 01:44.080]  We're launching via Nick.
[01:44.680 --> 01:45.760]  Let's pick some characters.
[01:46.340 --> 01:47.960]  So I think what we do is we each will pick one.
[01:48.300 --> 01:49.200]  We'll have it simulated.
[01:49.200 --> 01:51.280]  Before that, we need to do some rules.
[01:51.820 --> 01:53.380]  The cart's way before the horse right here.
[01:53.480 --> 01:55.380]  Are we doing items or no?
[01:56.640 --> 01:58.640]  I'd just assume everything is default.
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.520]  It's the default Smash experience, but it's AI.
[02:02.160 --> 02:04.320]  What is- what is default for item?
[02:05.020 --> 02:06.620]  I have no idea. I don't play Smash.
[02:06.820 --> 02:07.940]  That'll be up to you guys.
[02:08.080 --> 02:09.400]  Whatever you define as default.
[02:10.260 --> 02:11.640]  Well, what are these items here picked?
[02:11.740 --> 02:12.480]  Is that default?
[02:12.940 --> 02:13.200]  No.
[02:13.540 --> 02:14.420]  Not- no.
[02:14.540 --> 02:16.600]  This is- this is a very specific Chaos playlist.
[02:16.600 --> 02:19.240]  So actually, it could work for our purposes.
[02:19.660 --> 02:20.660]  Well, hold on.
[02:20.880 --> 02:21.380]  Hold on.
[02:21.380 --> 02:23.580]  If we're gonna pick items, how do we-
[02:23.580 --> 02:24.640]  We're not gonna pick items.
[02:24.800 --> 02:25.000]  We're not-
[02:25.000 --> 02:25.900]  There's a baseball.
[02:26.300 --> 02:27.540]  We gotta pick the baseball.
[02:27.960 --> 02:28.560]  That's true.
[02:28.820 --> 02:30.100]  Oh, the baseball bat's on.
[02:30.260 --> 02:30.880]  We could do the baseball.
[02:30.920 --> 02:32.360]  I think anything baseball-
[02:32.360 --> 02:34.320]  I think anything related to the show should be on.
[02:34.380 --> 02:35.180]  Everything else should be off.
[02:35.760 --> 02:36.400]  I agree.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.660]  So set it- set it to none.
[02:39.980 --> 02:41.500]  Go to set- go to set none.
[02:41.580 --> 02:42.120]  To a level.
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.940]  No, that doesn't- that doesn't-
[02:43.940 --> 02:45.120]  That would mean no items appear.
[02:45.120 --> 02:45.340]  Nope.
[02:45.840 --> 02:46.100]  Right.
[02:46.380 --> 02:46.700]  Nope.
[02:47.000 --> 02:47.180]  Right.
[02:47.440 --> 02:47.620]  Nope.
[02:47.660 --> 02:47.780]  Right.
[02:49.420 --> 02:50.200]  So medium.
[02:50.300 --> 02:50.980]  Put this on high.
[02:51.680 --> 02:53.200]  Scroll down one time.
[02:53.780 --> 02:54.780]  Go to set none.
[02:55.000 --> 02:55.400]  Oh, set none.
[02:55.880 --> 02:56.260]  Oh.
[02:57.420 --> 02:58.580]  I see what you're saying.
[02:58.720 --> 02:59.500]  I've never played this game.
[03:00.060 --> 03:00.380]  Baseball.
[03:00.380 --> 03:01.660]  Yeah, then shut up.
[03:01.880 --> 03:02.580]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[03:03.260 --> 03:03.380]  Yes.
[03:03.520 --> 03:03.860]  Jesus.
[03:04.780 --> 03:05.800]  A banana's a-
[03:06.360 --> 03:06.840]  Yes.
[03:07.000 --> 03:07.640]  Oh, definitely.
[03:07.980 --> 03:08.020]  Yes.
[03:08.220 --> 03:08.780]  Banana's in.
[03:08.780 --> 03:10.300]  Banana and the peel.
[03:11.620 --> 03:12.540]  Let's see.
[03:12.680 --> 03:13.760]  The banana peel should be in.
[03:13.860 --> 03:14.540]  It's above the baseball.
[03:16.720 --> 03:17.620]  Oh yeah, there's-
[03:17.620 --> 03:18.240]  Is that an egg?
[03:18.520 --> 03:20.840]  What is that thing on the right next to the Boston Bruins logo?
[03:23.580 --> 03:24.300]  No, it's a sticky-
[03:24.300 --> 03:24.520]  Which one?
[03:24.520 --> 03:24.840]  This one?
[03:24.900 --> 03:25.680]  It's a sticky bomb.
[03:25.840 --> 03:26.060]  No.
[03:26.340 --> 03:27.260]  A sticky bomb.
[03:27.360 --> 03:28.780]  Yeah, it looks like a pink egg.
[03:29.160 --> 03:29.260]  Yeah.
[03:29.420 --> 03:29.820]  Ice.
[03:30.780 --> 03:31.360]  Ray gun.
[03:31.780 --> 03:32.260]  Let's see.
[03:32.340 --> 03:33.820]  Is there anything else here that seems like it's related?
[03:33.820 --> 03:34.720]  Food, burger?
[03:34.980 --> 03:35.840]  Burger top right.
[03:36.080 --> 03:36.960]  Oh, there is a burger.
[03:37.480 --> 03:37.940]  That'll heal.
[03:38.320 --> 03:38.900]  All right, so burger.
[03:39.160 --> 03:39.300]  Yeah.
[03:41.300 --> 03:42.660]  Is that an-
[03:42.660 --> 03:43.000]  Hm.
[03:44.360 --> 03:47.480]  A timer? Hmm, did we use a timer? We've timed things.
[03:47.760 --> 03:49.080]  Is there a sushi container?
[03:50.720 --> 03:51.860]  Super spicy curry?
[03:52.340 --> 03:54.120]  Yeah, is there a spicy, icy...
[03:54.120 --> 03:57.660]  It's icy hot. So, okay, if you put that on, you have to go down to...
[03:57.660 --> 03:58.540]  and put on ice.
[03:58.860 --> 03:59.420]  To the ice.
[03:59.620 --> 04:01.540]  Yeah, I think we're good.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.300]  I think we're set.
[04:03.580 --> 04:05.540]  I feel good about what we got here.
[04:06.880 --> 04:08.740]  Is there a jackhammer or anything like that?
[04:08.780 --> 04:09.300]  There's a hammer.
[04:10.800 --> 04:12.120]  That's what we think of it.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.540]  Are there three tables stacked on top of each other?
[04:17.760 --> 04:20.000]  Okay, I think we're good here.
[04:20.720 --> 04:21.280]  Okay, sweet.
[04:21.900 --> 04:23.340]  So we will go back.
[04:24.020 --> 04:25.000]  And then...
[04:26.260 --> 04:27.400]  Stock seven lives.
[04:27.740 --> 04:28.660]  Okay, wow, that's a lot.
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.140]  No time limit.
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.140]  Jesus Christ.
[04:30.440 --> 04:30.940]  Do you want to do five instead?
[04:31.200 --> 04:31.400]  No, no.
[04:32.280 --> 04:34.280]  He's saying seven.
[04:35.120 --> 04:36.820]  Again, the guy who doesn't play this, it'll go fast.
[04:36.860 --> 04:40.300]  No, I do this every year for the spelling bee,
[04:40.440 --> 04:42.520]  and I do 99 lives, and it takes about an hour.
[04:43.540 --> 04:44.340]  Good lord.
[04:45.160 --> 04:47.260]  FS meter off, we'll turn the spirits off.
[04:47.320 --> 04:48.100]  That's all bonus shit.
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.280]  Are there really no legal responsibilities of the president or the secretary?
[04:53.640 --> 04:54.920]  I guess we're going to find out later, huh?
[04:56.720 --> 05:00.820]  I really want Gavin to be president, and I don't really care about the secretary.
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.520]  I did say that if I became president, I want to take a picture in front of an American flag.
[05:06.360 --> 05:08.800]  And hang it on the wall of the regulation office.
[05:08.800 --> 05:14.740]  I do think we should have a presidential photo hanging from the office at all times.
[05:15.040 --> 05:15.800]  Like we're a post office.
[05:16.940 --> 05:19.060]  With the secretary sat behind.
[05:19.180 --> 05:22.220]  Maybe we do this again in four years at the end of Gavin's term.
[05:22.920 --> 05:24.580]  Oh, should we have presidential terms?
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.040]  But the term is at the end of the term, we have to do the smash thing.
[05:32.540 --> 05:33.720]  This is the election.
[05:34.460 --> 05:37.040]  Alright, do we want to pick a stage or should we random?
[05:37.160 --> 05:37.560]  Just random.
[05:39.200 --> 05:41.120]  Is there a baseball field stage?
[05:41.600 --> 05:42.260]  There's not.
[05:44.400 --> 05:46.240]  Is there a sausage factory?
[05:48.040 --> 05:49.620]  There you go, CPU level nine.
[05:50.020 --> 05:52.060]  And then you need to add until we have five total.
[05:53.040 --> 05:53.240]  Yep.
[05:55.920 --> 05:56.360]  Boop.
[05:57.080 --> 05:59.020]  Okay, so first pick.
[06:00.000 --> 06:00.620]  First pick.
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.220]  Let's go Ant Egg.
[06:01.600 --> 06:03.020]  Yeah, let's go Ant Egg. Andrew, go for it.
[06:03.060 --> 06:04.120]  Well, don't we have to randomize?
[06:04.680 --> 06:05.820]  No, we're doing Ant Egg.
[06:06.880 --> 06:08.340]  I am going to go with...
[06:08.340 --> 06:08.760]  Bullshit.
[06:09.380 --> 06:09.700]  Wario.
[06:11.280 --> 06:11.760]  Wario.
[06:12.420 --> 06:13.660]  Where the hell is he? There he is.
[06:15.260 --> 06:16.220]  This one.
[06:17.820 --> 06:19.080]  Alright, Nick, that one's yours.
[06:19.900 --> 06:22.720]  Okay, that one's mine, so I'll go with...
[06:23.360 --> 06:25.560]  I'm going to go with Mario.
[06:25.700 --> 06:26.680]  The hell's Shulk?
[06:27.600 --> 06:28.400]  Next one's mine.
[06:29.240 --> 06:35.160]  Mine is Pikachu, but I need you to go left and right on the costume.
[06:35.520 --> 06:37.560]  And it is the Lucha Libre, bottom right.
[06:37.560 --> 06:38.720]  There you go, thank you very much.
[06:38.720 --> 06:39.040]  Got it.
[06:39.320 --> 06:40.020]  You know what?
[06:42.080 --> 06:42.480]  Nice.
[06:43.080 --> 06:43.880]  Oh, shit.
[06:45.360 --> 06:46.160]  Alright, Geoff?
[06:47.540 --> 06:48.720]  I'm going to go with...
[06:51.720 --> 06:52.120]  Ness.
[06:52.140 --> 06:52.320]  Link?
[06:52.680 --> 06:53.080]  No.
[06:53.280 --> 06:53.480]  Ness.
[06:53.800 --> 06:54.440]  No, Lil Mac.
[06:54.560 --> 06:54.960]  Lil Mac.
[06:56.800 --> 06:57.500]  Where's Lil Mac?
[06:57.580 --> 06:58.140]  He's right there.
[06:58.180 --> 06:59.160]  He's right below Wario.
[06:59.420 --> 07:01.520]  And can I see his costumes, please?
[07:02.180 --> 07:02.900]  Yes, you can.
[07:04.280 --> 07:05.240]  You got it.
[07:05.320 --> 07:05.480]  Yellow.
[07:05.480 --> 07:06.360]  Keep going.
[07:06.580 --> 07:06.700]  White.
[07:07.760 --> 07:08.600]  Oh, shit.
[07:08.660 --> 07:08.900]  I like that.
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.000]  There's a crazy one.
[07:10.000 --> 07:10.520]  You like this?
[07:10.640 --> 07:11.460]  I like that one.
[07:11.800 --> 07:13.180]  Put in Tronman.
[07:13.760 --> 07:14.480]  Yeah, Tronman.
[07:14.480 --> 07:15.640]  And then finally, Gavin.
[07:15.960 --> 07:16.500]  Lil Tron.
[07:17.280 --> 07:20.220]  Well, probably Wii Fit Trainer.
[07:20.860 --> 07:21.180]  Okay.
[07:22.860 --> 07:24.380]  What are the outfits?
[07:27.320 --> 07:28.540]  Not a lot of variety.
[07:29.340 --> 07:30.980]  I want to be Yellow Woman.
[07:31.600 --> 07:31.820]  Okay.
[07:31.940 --> 07:33.440]  Walking down the street.
[07:33.440 --> 07:34.300]  And what about you?
[07:34.300 --> 07:36.520]  Are you the piss lady outside of Andrew's window?
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.000]  Yeah, I'm Andrew's piss lady.
[07:38.600 --> 07:39.700]  Andrew, you want the classic?
[07:40.220 --> 07:41.420]  Yeah, let's go classic.
[07:42.260 --> 07:42.460]  Okay.
[07:43.520 --> 07:43.980]  Y'all ready?
[07:44.420 --> 07:46.860]  The first person eliminated will be secretary.
[07:47.140 --> 07:48.280]  Whoever wins is president.
[07:48.880 --> 07:49.120]  Okay.
[07:49.380 --> 07:49.940]  I'm ready.
[07:50.420 --> 07:54.520]  I'm emailing our lawyer after this, so this is real.
[07:55.180 --> 07:56.720]  I thought you were emailing him right now.
[07:56.780 --> 07:57.700]  Alright, let's do this.
[07:58.080 --> 08:00.500]  I just want to finish second, third, or fourth.
[08:00.500 --> 08:00.920]  Yes.
[08:03.020 --> 08:05.420]  Why is everybody against being secretary?
[08:06.340 --> 08:07.840]  It sounds like there's going to be paperwork.
[08:08.420 --> 08:08.640]  Yeah.
[08:09.720 --> 08:10.920]  That's what it sounds like.
[08:10.980 --> 08:11.440]  Oh, I like that.
[08:11.440 --> 08:12.540]  What is the frame rate?
[08:13.900 --> 08:14.900]  It's about 12.
[08:15.100 --> 08:16.820]  I think he's got about 12 frames going right now.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.160]  I mean, Nick, there's nothing you're going to fix right now.
[08:21.480 --> 08:22.000]  No, it's fine.
[08:22.120 --> 08:22.420]  No.
[08:23.300 --> 08:24.100]  What do you mean, no?
[08:24.940 --> 08:25.340]  No.
[08:26.100 --> 08:27.500]  I think he's agreeing with you.
[08:27.980 --> 08:29.320]  What does no mean?
[08:29.320 --> 08:31.780]  Okay, I guess he's not agreeing with you.
[08:32.220 --> 08:33.340]  Does it look bad to you, Nick?
[08:33.340 --> 08:34.280]  It looks okay on the capture.
[08:34.960 --> 08:35.600]  That's fine.
[08:35.660 --> 08:36.740]  As long as it looks good on the capture.
[08:37.480 --> 08:38.820]  Little Mac got a bat.
[08:38.920 --> 08:40.640]  Let's hit some dingers, baby.
[08:41.380 --> 08:41.720]  Warrior.
[08:41.860 --> 08:43.520]  No one's dead yet.
[08:43.880 --> 08:45.840]  Stay out of the fucking water, Little Mac.
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.240]  Mario's getting beat the fuck up.
[08:47.580 --> 08:49.040]  I'm getting destroyed.
[08:49.700 --> 08:49.860]  Yeah.
[08:50.160 --> 08:50.900]  Oh, fuck.
[08:51.540 --> 08:51.800]  No.
[08:52.200 --> 08:52.520]  Shit.
[08:52.740 --> 08:54.120]  First death goes to Mario.
[08:54.680 --> 08:57.040]  Andrew is closer than ever to becoming secretary.
[08:57.260 --> 08:58.300]  Oh, no.
[08:58.300 --> 09:01.080]  Dude, I'm spiking volleyballs left and right.
[09:01.720 --> 09:02.520]  Oh, shit.
[09:02.800 --> 09:02.920]  Okay.
[09:03.800 --> 09:05.740]  Pikachu's in fucking maniac mode right now.
[09:06.780 --> 09:07.500]  He's going shmi mode.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.840]  Oh, Pikachu came into this going shmi mode, dude.
[09:11.620 --> 09:12.720]  Get the landing on the tree.
[09:13.020 --> 09:13.740]  Watch out, there's a shark.
[09:14.460 --> 09:15.980]  Kill some of these people.
[09:16.840 --> 09:17.240]  Can it eat you?
[09:17.340 --> 09:18.320]  Did I just heal?
[09:18.660 --> 09:19.280]  Oh, no.
[09:19.780 --> 09:20.540]  Oh, wow.
[09:20.660 --> 09:21.340]  Pikachu died.
[09:21.540 --> 09:21.560]  No.
[09:21.700 --> 09:22.940]  Wii Fit trainer is at seven.
[09:23.060 --> 09:23.960]  Gavin, you're in the lead.
[09:24.580 --> 09:25.080]  Oh, shit.
[09:25.180 --> 09:26.100]  Gavin may become president.
[09:26.100 --> 09:28.620]  Oh, please have Gavin be president.
[09:29.460 --> 09:29.940]  No.
[09:31.420 --> 09:32.380]  I'm 128%.
[09:32.380 --> 09:33.320]  Get out of there, Wario.
[09:33.480 --> 09:33.720]  No.
[09:34.940 --> 09:38.280]  We could have just elected him president, but we chose to do it this way.
[09:38.820 --> 09:40.400]  At Eric's insistence.
[09:41.240 --> 09:43.100]  How is Wii Fit trainer still at duty?
[09:43.800 --> 09:45.140]  Please kill the trainer.
[09:45.720 --> 09:47.100]  I'm at 160%.
[09:47.920 --> 09:49.160]  Oh, my God.
[09:49.580 --> 09:51.860]  How is Wario still going at 150 here?
[09:52.080 --> 09:53.020]  Oh, wow.
[09:54.440 --> 09:54.860]  All right.
[09:54.860 --> 09:56.060]  It's all tied up.
[09:57.080 --> 09:57.560]  Fuck.
[09:57.620 --> 09:58.160]  Never mind.
[09:58.340 --> 09:59.280]  Wario's down to five.
[09:59.760 --> 10:01.440]  Wario's getting his shit pushed in.
[10:02.140 --> 10:02.920]  Where are you?
[10:03.180 --> 10:04.120]  For the love of God.
[10:05.320 --> 10:07.240]  Oh, we got the spicy curry going.
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.260]  Oh, Wario's on a bike.
[10:10.660 --> 10:11.480]  Watch out for the shark.
[10:12.420 --> 10:13.380]  Oh, God.
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.120]  I can't believe this is how we determine roles for our company.
[10:17.320 --> 10:20.060]  I can't believe you can't believe it.
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.080]  No, Wario.
[10:22.620 --> 10:24.020]  I can't be a secretary.
[10:24.020 --> 10:24.980]  I don't know anything.
[10:25.180 --> 10:26.360]  Mario's down to five.
[10:27.180 --> 10:28.840]  Wario and Mario are at five.
[10:29.100 --> 10:31.280]  Oh, Wario's getting so fucked up still.
[10:31.880 --> 10:33.320]  Pull it together, Wario.
[10:34.060 --> 10:35.340]  I forget my own appointments.
[10:35.840 --> 10:36.900]  Little Max cooked.
[10:37.860 --> 10:39.080]  Oh, stop.
[10:40.300 --> 10:41.320]  Fuck me.
[10:41.720 --> 10:42.240]  Down to five.
[10:45.000 --> 10:45.440]  Shit.
[10:45.700 --> 10:47.660]  Wario down to every tile.
[10:48.040 --> 10:49.860]  Why am I last every round?
[10:51.140 --> 10:53.120]  You're going to be a secretary.
[10:53.120 --> 10:54.520]  No, I'm not.
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.320]  Wario's about to become an active gamer and turn the tables on all of you.
[11:00.040 --> 11:01.180]  Place a solid third.
[11:01.640 --> 11:04.060]  I think he's about to be a full-spectrum warrior.
[11:05.200 --> 11:06.380]  Full-spectrum secretary?
[11:10.380 --> 11:13.400]  Geoff, how are you feeling right now? You're at five.
[11:13.480 --> 11:16.180]  I feel very good. I feel like middle of the road.
[11:16.420 --> 11:19.740]  I feel like I'm going to slot in at third place probably.
[11:19.900 --> 11:22.200]  And that's truly where you've been spending your career, right?
[11:22.200 --> 11:23.600]  Yeah, just right in the middle.
[11:23.920 --> 11:24.520]  Yeah.
[11:25.980 --> 11:28.540]  Wario is at 120% on four lives.
[11:28.620 --> 11:29.760]  It's so bullshit.
[11:30.340 --> 11:30.940]  No!
[11:31.540 --> 11:32.940]  Oh, that was me.
[11:34.200 --> 11:35.520]  Down to five.
[11:36.260 --> 11:37.580]  Pikachu in the...
[11:37.580 --> 11:40.120]  Heading for the presidency.
[11:40.420 --> 11:41.200]  No, it's dead even.
[11:41.620 --> 11:43.280]  The future of the company.
[11:43.820 --> 11:46.460]  Wario, just chill out.
[11:46.840 --> 11:47.960]  I'm folding in front of us.
[11:48.340 --> 11:49.260]  Get out of the...
[11:50.600 --> 11:51.020]  No!
[11:52.580 --> 11:54.380]  I'm a whole life down.
[11:54.800 --> 11:56.080]  Grab the eyes, stupid!
[11:56.600 --> 12:01.740]  You know the thing about getting to be the president is you get to put that on your business card and the rest of us don't.
[12:01.820 --> 12:02.720]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.860]  We should even have to write, like, not the president on everybody else's business cards.
[12:08.720 --> 12:11.140]  That we'll have made for sure because it's 2024.
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.380]  I was going to say, this is the last time Geoff had to do business like this. People were using business cards.
[12:17.180 --> 12:21.720]  I remember the day Geoff bought a thousand business cards for Ray.
[12:24.640 --> 12:27.600]  Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.540]  He's probably still got all 1,000, I would think.
[12:30.620 --> 12:31.720]  I still have it in my wallet.
[12:32.260 --> 12:33.380]  Oh, little Mac!
[12:34.940 --> 12:36.620]  Getting cooked. We've been trainer.
[12:37.300 --> 12:37.940]  Still at four.
[12:39.180 --> 12:41.240]  Eric currently in the lead for presidency.
[12:41.640 --> 12:43.460]  It's true. Me and you were both at five.
[12:43.860 --> 12:44.460]  Like, when...
[12:44.460 --> 12:48.580]  This is going to be tough. Well, that's because Pikachu's got the hot from the spicy hot.
[12:48.720 --> 12:50.000]  It's really taking care of business here.
[12:50.440 --> 12:50.880]  Yeah.
[12:51.980 --> 12:53.080]  He's locked in.
[12:55.120 --> 12:55.700]  Who's gone?
[12:56.560 --> 12:59.640]  Nobody. We were like, we fit trainer, but we survived.
[13:00.480 --> 13:01.300]  Oh, damn!
[13:01.640 --> 13:03.660]  How are you down to two?
[13:04.060 --> 13:04.460]  Nick!
[13:05.540 --> 13:05.980]  Come on!
[13:08.220 --> 13:12.360]  Nick, you set this up in four minutes and did us a great favor. Come on, man.
[13:12.360 --> 13:15.480]  This way fit trainer is impossible to kill.
[13:15.600 --> 13:17.460]  Yeah, it really stays in a lot.
[13:17.520 --> 13:20.060]  Pikachu's down to four. Gavin's in the lead for president.
[13:20.120 --> 13:20.840]  Oh, shit.
[13:22.120 --> 13:23.200]  Oh, fuck.
[13:23.300 --> 13:24.680]  There you go.
[13:25.100 --> 13:25.440]  No!
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.600]  Mario is at two. Mario and little Mac at three. Me and Gavin are tied at four.
[13:34.620 --> 13:41.760]  Remember, the first eliminated will be the secretary of our regulation company.
[13:42.360 --> 13:44.720]  I hate that I came up with this idea. God damn it.
[13:44.900 --> 13:45.300]  Wario.
[13:47.020 --> 13:48.960]  Little Mac just took a boat ride.
[13:49.060 --> 13:49.920]  Did you see that?
[13:50.900 --> 13:52.260]  Why did I leave on a boat?
[13:52.840 --> 13:54.060]  It killed him.
[13:54.200 --> 13:56.560]  Little Mac is close to me now.
[13:57.220 --> 13:58.380]  Geoff might be the secretary.
[13:58.800 --> 13:59.420]  No, I'm not.
[14:00.480 --> 14:01.800]  Geoff, look out for the shark.
[14:02.480 --> 14:04.300]  I'm not going to be the secretary. You are.
[14:06.140 --> 14:08.200]  No fucking shot I'm going to be the secretary.
[14:08.700 --> 14:10.080]  Just hide, Wario.
[14:10.960 --> 14:13.200]  Little Mac is almost past you in damage.
[14:13.500 --> 14:15.100]  Come on, Pikachu. Let's go.
[14:15.940 --> 14:20.080]  My problem is I'm a fighter. I'm not a coward like Andrew. God damn it.
[14:20.740 --> 14:22.140]  I'm fine being a coward.
[14:23.000 --> 14:23.980]  Wario, get out!
[14:24.800 --> 14:27.120]  I'm fine being a coward.
[14:28.600 --> 14:29.600]  Gavin's got a bat.
[14:30.420 --> 14:31.420]  Go on, smash him.
[14:31.920 --> 14:33.060]  Fuck him up, little Mac.
[14:33.780 --> 14:35.420]  Baseball bat. Oh my god.
[14:35.720 --> 14:36.920]  He could be hitting dingers right now.
[14:36.920 --> 14:37.720]  No!
[14:38.140 --> 14:40.760]  It's safe in the trees. Stay in the tree.
[14:41.020 --> 14:41.580]  Volleyball!
[14:41.960 --> 14:43.660]  You're also green.
[14:44.060 --> 14:45.180]  Little Mac down to two.
[14:47.080 --> 14:48.640]  We've been traded down to three.
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.580]  Pikachu down to three.
[14:52.240 --> 14:53.440]  Someone beat up little Mac.
[14:54.020 --> 14:54.780]  A neck.
[14:56.100 --> 14:58.380]  Oh my god. This is so intense.
[14:58.380 --> 14:59.820]  Why am I in the middle of it?
[15:00.020 --> 15:02.120]  Why are we doing this?
[15:02.180 --> 15:02.580]  No!
[15:03.720 --> 15:04.280]  Whoa!
[15:06.920 --> 15:08.780]  Oh my god, a Wario!
[15:09.080 --> 15:10.540]  Wario's down to one.
[15:10.540 --> 15:11.520]  Wario's down to one.
[15:11.780 --> 15:13.580]  We've been traders down to two.
[15:14.100 --> 15:15.600]  Wario's down to two.
[15:17.220 --> 15:18.780]  Will somebody kill Andrew?
[15:18.780 --> 15:19.540]  Somebody kill little Mac.
[15:19.720 --> 15:20.480]  Where's the secretary?
[15:22.400 --> 15:23.440]  Kill Wario.
[15:25.140 --> 15:26.320]  Kill him hard.
[15:27.760 --> 15:29.160]  Wario, get off the boat.
[15:30.360 --> 15:31.280]  Oh my god.
[15:31.300 --> 15:32.900]  How am I already at 60 damage?
[15:33.140 --> 15:34.980]  I just respawned.
[15:34.980 --> 15:35.960]  What is happening?
[15:38.540 --> 15:39.460]  Pikachu.
[15:39.980 --> 15:41.420]  Stay in the trees, little Mac.
[15:42.580 --> 15:44.100]  Fuck the bananas.
[15:44.540 --> 15:45.020]  Pikachu.
[15:46.500 --> 15:47.420]  Wario!
[15:48.740 --> 15:50.880]  Andrew is the secretary.
[15:54.840 --> 15:57.000]  You're the fucking secretary.
[15:58.200 --> 16:00.980]  Now this is truly an international business.
[16:00.980 --> 16:01.680]  Oh.
[16:03.640 --> 16:04.460]  Oh my god.
[16:04.460 --> 16:06.300]  Are there any legalities we're going to have to deal with?
[16:06.560 --> 16:09.140]  I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, huh?
[16:10.060 --> 16:11.840]  We've been trying to get smashed in.
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.040]  Andrew lost and ate the applesauce.
[16:15.380 --> 16:15.560]  Yep.
[16:16.360 --> 16:17.780]  Who's going to shoot the BB gun?
[16:18.160 --> 16:19.580]  No! Mario!
[16:20.560 --> 16:22.440]  Mario and little Mac down to one.
[16:22.860 --> 16:24.020]  Looking good for Pikachu.
[16:25.760 --> 16:26.280]  Uh oh.
[16:26.820 --> 16:29.600]  I mean, you guys got to be feeling good though. You're not going to have to do shit.
[16:30.000 --> 16:30.320]  Yeah.
[16:30.840 --> 16:32.840]  You know what? I do feel a lot better.
[16:33.720 --> 16:34.320]  Oh no!
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.380]  Yeah, well, you're the secretary.
[16:38.140 --> 16:40.560]  Start looking up what a secretary has to do. That's your job.
[16:40.680 --> 16:41.900]  Hoisted by his own petard.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.600]  Hey, Andrew, we're going to need you to take minutes on this meeting.
[16:45.920 --> 16:48.340]  Andrew, we're going to need you to work on your keystrokes per minute.
[16:49.600 --> 16:50.420]  We fit Trinidad to one.
[16:50.420 --> 16:54.700]  I got some thoughts. I'm going to want to put that on paper later. I'm going to need you in my office to...
[16:55.640 --> 16:57.220]  I'm going to need you in my office.
[16:57.980 --> 17:00.460]  The good news is, though, you can add it to your things list.
[17:00.760 --> 17:03.580]  Oh! Everyone's down to one life!
[17:03.920 --> 17:05.320]  It is anyone's game!
[17:06.660 --> 17:07.880]  It truly is.
[17:08.220 --> 17:11.000]  On the screen here, we are looking at the new president.
[17:11.040 --> 17:12.980]  Get off the boat, little Mac! Not again!
[17:14.120 --> 17:15.520]  The presidential battle.
[17:16.020 --> 17:17.100]  Oh, throw a Yaris!
[17:18.080 --> 17:19.500]  Get off the fucking boat, little Mac!
[17:19.800 --> 17:20.660]  Little Mac is out!
[17:21.560 --> 17:23.940]  Pikachu just depresidented little Mac.
[17:24.020 --> 17:24.260]  Yep.
[17:25.660 --> 17:29.020]  Oh, it's not looking good for Wii Fit Trainer.
[17:30.400 --> 17:31.480]  Oh, this is close.
[17:31.700 --> 17:33.560]  Can that connect with my baseball bat right here?
[17:33.940 --> 17:36.840]  This is looking like a Pikachu company right here.
[17:37.580 --> 17:39.080]  Mario's still in this thing.
[17:40.220 --> 17:40.420]  Oh!
[17:41.560 --> 17:42.800]  Wow. Wow.
[17:43.400 --> 17:44.960]  It is so close.
[17:45.580 --> 17:46.520]  Oh, Mario's gone.
[17:47.360 --> 17:49.420]  Alright, you're looking at the next president.
[17:49.660 --> 17:51.820]  The battle for the president. Here we go!
[17:51.820 --> 17:55.500]  Gavin, you're about to become president of this company.
[17:55.660 --> 17:57.680]  Oh no, it's so close!
[17:58.160 --> 18:00.060]  Oh, 85 to 82 percent.
[18:00.880 --> 18:02.800]  Oh, a battle of bats!
[18:03.280 --> 18:03.720]  Oh!
[18:04.080 --> 18:06.100]  It is a game of inches.
[18:06.540 --> 18:06.620]  Oh!
[18:08.720 --> 18:10.440]  It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[18:12.360 --> 18:15.140]  Why am I doing stretching? That's now still the time.
[18:15.640 --> 18:16.760]  Oh, run!
[18:17.940 --> 18:20.650]  Oh no!
[18:21.790 --> 18:22.270]  President!
[18:24.210 --> 18:26.290]  Wow, you could have volunteered last night.
[18:26.810 --> 18:29.270]  Guys, there it is.
[18:30.130 --> 18:33.930]  I am the president and Andrew is the secretary.
[18:34.690 --> 18:35.690]  Oh man.
[18:36.210 --> 18:37.070]  There we go.
[18:38.170 --> 18:41.510]  Look at that, you did nothing. Four KOs.
[18:41.790 --> 18:48.350]  Now, I will say, just like in this show, Geoff did the heavy lifting with nine kills.
[18:54.350 --> 18:56.510]  Me and me and me.
[18:56.510 --> 18:57.830]  I was support.
[18:58.170 --> 19:05.010]  And I coasted all the way through to the end. I took the victory with four kills.
[19:05.550 --> 19:07.710]  I killed Geoff three times.
[19:08.130 --> 19:09.810]  And Gavin won.
[19:10.050 --> 19:16.030]  If that screams not the fucking story of my life right there, Jesus Christ.
[19:17.150 --> 19:23.250]  Guys, that's it. I have to email our lawyer right now, so we have to wrap this up.
[19:23.690 --> 19:31.510]  Thank you so much for watching this determination of what our company has become.
[19:32.290 --> 19:38.470]  And condolences to Andrew and congratulations to Eric, the new Bernie Burns Badour.
[19:39.830 --> 19:40.490]  Amazing.
[19:41.550 --> 19:43.370]  Hail to the chief.
[19:45.190 --> 19:46.930]  This is great, guys.
[19:47.710 --> 19:50.010]  I'm excited for the election in another four years.
[19:50.410 --> 19:53.190]  We don't deserve to have a company.
[19:53.810 --> 19:54.410]  I agree.
[19:55.210 --> 19:56.230]  I agree.
[19:57.010 --> 19:58.910]  You think that's what the lawyer is going to respond with?
[19:59.030 --> 20:01.650]  Yes, probably. Okay, go listen to the podcast.
[20:02.430 --> 20:03.730]  Thank you, bye.
[20:04.030 --> 20:04.770]  Bye now.
