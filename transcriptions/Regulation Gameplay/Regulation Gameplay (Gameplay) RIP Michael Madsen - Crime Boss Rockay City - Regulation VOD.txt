[00:00.000 --> 00:01.820]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen.
[00:03.940 --> 00:09.840]  We lost him yesterday. We lost, uh, we, uh, heaven gained an angel, as they say.
[00:10.820 --> 00:18.300]  Rest in peace. So we're playing Crime Boss Rock A City. Was he, he was 67? Yeah, he was 67.
[00:20.920 --> 00:25.740]  Getting seafood up there at the pearly gates. Michael Madsen. I thought you were saying he died
[00:25.740 --> 00:29.520]  getting seafood. Oh yeah, I thought, like, did he have an allergic reaction to mussels or something?
[00:29.520 --> 00:33.340]  No, he's talking about a video he sent me, Andrew sent me earlier today,
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.040]  where he was talking about seafood. So that was a reference for one person and one person only.
[00:38.300 --> 00:41.600]  Made me happy. I don't need to, you know, sometimes you got to do things for yourself.
[00:42.380 --> 00:48.120]  He was in a James Bond movie once. Which one? The worst one.
[00:49.500 --> 00:55.180]  Die Another Day? Live and Let Die. Nope. I like that I knew it right away.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  That's pretty good. So we're playing Rock A City, a game that nobody played and nobody is playing.
[01:02.260 --> 01:06.240]  We're the number one Rock A streamers right now. I would assume we're the number one
[01:06.240 --> 01:13.160]  Rock A streamers on Twitch. So let everyone know it's the 4th of July, Michael Madsen's dead,
[01:13.300 --> 01:19.980]  and we're readying up. This game, if you don't know, is just Payday, but reskinned. Yeah.
[01:21.580 --> 01:25.700]  Andrew, yeah, let's ready up. Let's do this thing. And you can tell us about how you beat
[01:25.700 --> 01:30.100]  this entire game. Oh, I finished it. And now it looks a lot like their layout makes a lot more
[01:30.100 --> 01:39.680]  sense, where it looks like you can pick specific jobs. Let's go normal. Okay, yes, create lobby.
[01:39.680 --> 01:44.860]  And I think we all should be here now. Did Andrew just disappear for anyone else?
[01:44.860 --> 01:47.840]  Uh, his character. Oh, there we go.
[01:48.140 --> 01:57.140]  The big boss. Rest in peace, big dog. It's really unnerving how he was staring at us for a minute.
[01:57.140 --> 02:00.540]  It was really weird. Uh, all right. Well, Michael Madsen.
[02:00.700 --> 02:07.760]  In the sky. Lives on forever. Such an enthusiastic tribute. Rest in peace, homie.
[02:08.980 --> 02:17.340]  Oh, God. Thanks to a sheepy. Thank you so much for the subs. Let's start this mission.
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.280]  Let's start this mission. Oh, my God. It should be twenty nine. Twenty nine. Geoff decided not to
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.480]  be here. He said, you guys do the tribute. And we said, you got it. He's in chat.
[02:29.800 --> 02:36.320]  This was one of the last games I had to pay for. He was not fake. Geoff isn't real. That is. That
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.940]  is not. Fake Geoff is real, Geoff. DG Geoff is fake. I think we should ban DG Geoff, but that's just how
[02:42.940 --> 02:47.940]  I feel. DG Geoff is fake? Yes, it's not Geoff. And I think that it's a trick. And I don't like. I
[02:47.940 --> 02:51.920]  banned him from my chat. Oh, because DG Geoff asked me for the credit card the other day and I gave
[02:51.920 --> 02:57.560]  it to him. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Wait, you have a credit card? Nah, just kidding. Well, I do have a
[02:57.560 --> 03:00.620]  credit card. That is true. But I didn't give it to anyone. It's not. He's saying it's not a trick.
[03:00.780 --> 03:04.920]  It is a trick. He's tricking us. I don't like it. All right. We got to get closer to the concert
[03:04.920 --> 03:16.060]  area. Let's be sneaky. We all just came out of the back of this truck. Oh, it's popped off.
[03:17.100 --> 03:20.840]  Gavin, what did you do? Gavin? I was looking at the moving van.
[03:21.800 --> 03:24.780]  Oh, my God. Are you just murdering all these people? They're gang members.
[03:25.580 --> 03:30.660]  I mean, you know, they're gang members. I'm sending them to meet me. Oh, God.
[03:31.560 --> 03:38.080]  Here's the who's who's view are we watching at night? That's Nick. Hello, Nick. Yeah,
[03:38.700 --> 03:43.580]  it's maybe there's just you. I don't know. It's all I assume the name burn says that on
[03:43.580 --> 03:49.160]  the stream. Yeah, sure. Search the trucks. OK, I'm getting a buzz saw. OK, let's just.
[03:51.540 --> 03:55.580]  What happened? I don't know. I was walking by someone and they're like,
[03:55.640 --> 03:58.080]  fucking aren't you dead? And then it popped off.
[04:01.100 --> 04:05.980]  Oh, my God. What is I'm just getting? I'm just annihilated here.
[04:06.280 --> 04:11.760]  Was this meant to be stealth? Yeah. Yeah. It's like payday where it's supposed to be quiet.
[04:11.960 --> 04:17.380]  And then. So what? Nick just went apeshit again. You know, I think he saw me and said,
[04:17.420 --> 04:21.480]  Michael Madsen, you're dead. What are you doing here? And then he got really upset
[04:21.480 --> 04:27.220]  and then it all popped off. Yeah. He went in for the selfie. OK, so we get a bonus.
[04:27.920 --> 04:35.240]  Nick is fucking toast. I guess. Can you cover someone if they're down? I guess I am. But
[04:35.240 --> 04:41.680]  I'll get you in a minute, Nick. You can pick me up. I'll cover you. I got you. I threw a brick.
[04:43.540 --> 04:51.160]  This is not how this is supposed to be working, boys. I got you. I got you. Thank you. As a
[04:51.160 --> 04:57.840]  level 20 player, this is easy work for Michael Madsen. This is not good. What is happening?
[04:58.120 --> 05:02.340]  OK, let's let's kill some of these people so we can open these trucks. Gavin's down. Gavin. Gavin.
[05:02.340 --> 05:06.360]  Gavin, I'll save your life. Gavin, don't say don't say anything. Gavin, we'll get you. What's that
[05:06.360 --> 05:16.280]  theme? Yeah. You're back, buddy. Putting this on. OK. Saw is placed. Why are there lasers? Oh,
[05:16.280 --> 05:22.760]  we're at a vanilla ice show and we got to kill the new ice. Why is it? Oh, should we start again?
[05:22.900 --> 05:28.660]  So we're not. Yeah. What is happening? Well, let's take it until we die so we can just get
[05:28.660 --> 05:34.760]  out. We're going to beat this mission. Why can we play payday again soon? We're doing it. We're
[05:34.760 --> 05:40.520]  playing payday. Payday doesn't have Chuck Norris in it. Probably not. Kid, you should not be
[05:40.520 --> 05:45.340]  looking at this. Are you talking to your kid? Yeah. Archie, don't look at the screen. Look
[05:45.340 --> 05:49.880]  away. Look away. Look away. Look away. Look away. Look away. Look away. I'm going in. I'm
[05:49.880 --> 05:57.640]  in a locker room. It's OK. Oh, thanks to Andrew Pulos for the five gifted subs. Thank you so much
[05:57.640 --> 06:01.720]  for the subs. Thank you. It's just for adults, buddy. Nick's in a locker room and he's hiding
[06:01.720 --> 06:10.120]  from his kid. It's all right, bud. No, look away. Of all the times to have your kid sit in to watch,
[06:10.120 --> 06:15.500]  I don't know why you thought the gangster payday stream was the one. Well, it's bring your kid to
[06:15.500 --> 06:27.640]  work day in America. Oh, July 4th. I see. Nick is just in. I'm in a building. He's just in here.
[06:27.960 --> 06:32.880]  We should do versions of Let's Plays where Nick has to keep them safe for his kid and play the
[06:32.880 --> 06:37.100]  worst games possible. So he's like in the lockers, he's like under the cars.
[06:38.520 --> 06:41.540]  Just hiding from the action? Hiding from the action.
[06:42.340 --> 06:52.550]  OK, bugsaw's done. OK, OK. Grab the fireworks and take them to the top.
[06:53.290 --> 06:56.550]  You got it. I got a box. Daddy's got the fireworks.
[06:56.550 --> 07:06.490]  Oh. Oh. Good Lord. We gotta launch these into the sky. Much like where Michael Madsen currently is.
[07:06.710 --> 07:11.390]  Uh oh. Come to me, Gavin. Come to me, Gavin. Come to me, Gavin. Oh God, I'm under fire. Gotta run,
[07:11.470 --> 07:16.590]  Gavin. Oh no. I'm shooting kneecaps. I'm on the offensive. I got you. I got you.
[07:18.170 --> 07:23.070]  Oh my God, there's so many fucking guys. We're clearing it out. What? Oh my God,
[07:23.070 --> 07:29.330]  they're everywhere. Hold to give up down. What's that? No, I got you. I got you. I got you. I got
[07:29.330 --> 07:33.650]  you. Gavin, you're up. Gavin, you're up. What does that even mean? Hold to give up down. So you can
[07:33.650 --> 07:40.830]  like die and then respawn. You see. Hold to give up down. But it said hold to give up down. Oh my
[07:40.830 --> 07:45.150]  God, I'm I'm getting fucking wasted. OK, we're going to launch these fireworks. OK, Gavin has
[07:45.150 --> 07:52.150]  some. Oh, Gavin's fucking exploded. Oh my God. I'm down by the fireworks. I'm down by the fireworks.
[07:52.150 --> 07:57.730]  I'm working on it. Sorry, I need to take a moment. I'm fucking dying. Do your thing. Gavin was in
[07:57.730 --> 08:03.050]  front of me and then he was a cloud of red. Andrew, I'm coming to the stairs. OK, yeah,
[08:03.070 --> 08:08.170]  I'm running up the steps. I'm dying. Yeah, I got you. I got you. Hold to give up down state. That
[08:08.170 --> 08:12.730]  is really what it says. How do I fucking... Sorry, I don't know how to drop. No, it's fine. I got
[08:12.730 --> 08:16.830]  30. I got 30 seconds. So just come and get me. Andrew, there's a laser beam on your forehead.
[08:18.030 --> 08:20.110]  Yeah. Two of the same man on the stairs.
[08:22.150 --> 08:26.250]  By the way, the spectating in this is terrible and brutal. Oh, we got you. We got you.
[08:27.130 --> 08:33.370]  Hit the button. Hit the... launch them. I launched them. Is he still on the stage? I don't know why
[08:33.370 --> 08:40.670]  we're doing this. I don't either. Oh, we draw him out. That's vanilla ice. We got him. There we go.
[08:40.670 --> 08:46.870]  Launch. Launch. Clean execution. Ah! Andrew, they're all on the roof. How did they get here?
[08:47.330 --> 08:51.570]  Oh my God, Eric went down. The stairs, fool. How do you think they got here?
[08:52.790 --> 08:55.750]  Andrew, your back is just a giant splash of red.
[08:56.530 --> 09:02.990]  That wasn't the last of them. More are coming. Oh, I'm coming to you alive. You just get plowed
[09:02.990 --> 09:08.770]  down dead. Oh, I'm dead. OK, this time, whoever fucked it up last time, don't do it again.
[09:09.470 --> 09:13.690]  Do you really need to sabotage the sound system at a vanilla ice show?
[09:15.490 --> 09:22.950]  Dude, it's crazy. Dude, in Rock A, anything goes. Yeah. Hey, look, it's one guy.
[09:24.170 --> 09:27.390]  Yeah. No stars at three. Let's load back in. Do you want to do that or do you want to do
[09:27.390 --> 09:33.050]  something else? No, let's do it again. We just won't do it bad. Now that I know to hold LB to
[09:33.050 --> 09:39.790]  give up to get down or whatever, I think I'm going to give up to give up to give up and up
[09:39.790 --> 09:46.290]  to get down and say, what are you doing, Andrew? You switch it. I didn't mean to. Oh, I'm good.
[09:46.490 --> 09:55.170]  I'm ready. Launching mission. Give up to get down or whatever it said. Oh, my God. I think
[09:55.170 --> 10:00.490]  my experience is getting degraded, but it's not by the high ping. No, I agree with you.
[10:01.190 --> 10:07.450]  Thank you so much to Scott Steiner for this. I don't know if he owns that anymore. No,
[10:07.490 --> 10:15.730]  I think he sold it. Yeah. Whoa. Damn. Oh, will do. Oh, is it? I get it.
[10:16.550 --> 10:24.570]  Yep. Give up to get down, everyone. So stay away from gang members. See,
[10:24.690 --> 10:28.070]  he's getting alerted on the left, on the left, on the left. Get away from the left.
[10:28.710 --> 10:36.390]  Nick, I'm away from it with you. No, I'm watching all of you. I watched all of it.
[10:36.390 --> 10:43.650]  I watched it also. I literally stood next to Andrew. You want to restart? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[10:46.450 --> 10:50.550]  Nick stood by them, got alerted, then ran to me after it went off and said,
[10:50.610 --> 10:54.910]  I'm standing next to you. I walked two feet forward from the starting point. Look at what
[10:54.910 --> 10:59.750]  has happened. I'm not saying like, it's not your fault, Nick, but that is what happens. It was very
[10:59.750 --> 11:04.030]  funny for you to walk to me and then be like, but I'm next to you. It's like, yeah, it already occurred.
[11:04.690 --> 11:10.890]  Okay, so where do we go? Just avoid the left, I think. We just, well. I didn't go left. I went
[11:10.890 --> 11:18.550]  straight. Holy shit. Thank you so much. It's just, it's just like, watch people get like the little
[11:18.550 --> 11:22.830]  dials above their heads because you didn't notice. I'm going to stay in the, in the truck.
[11:22.830 --> 11:28.270]  Can you swim? No, why? What? Just to scout. That's me. Hey, that was me. That was me.
[11:29.650 --> 11:35.690]  Okay, well, so it. What? So what? That was me. It's just that guy. He wasn't there last time.
[11:35.850 --> 11:42.770]  They, he, he moved. He was. Tony Braxerman with the five gifted subs. Thank you so much, Braxerman.
[11:43.390 --> 11:47.930]  I think we have to walk out of this thing and go, um. To the right. No, I think you have to go to
[11:47.930 --> 11:53.470]  the left because the right is a dead end with another game member. Okay, so let's, maybe let's
[11:53.470 --> 11:57.310]  just evaluate the scene as soon as we get out. Walk out and immediately look right. I think
[11:57.310 --> 12:01.890]  there's a gang member right there with like a barricade. Can you get prone and crawl out of the
[12:01.890 --> 12:12.070]  trucks? Uh. Oh my morgs. Oh, oh my morgs with the weekly sub drop. I'm going right. Okay, so right.
[12:12.070 --> 12:14.390]  Right looks clear to me. No gang member over here.
[12:16.330 --> 12:23.470]  Okay. Looking like we're okay so far. Okay, I'm climbing up on top of this little thing. Yeah, I hear you.
[12:24.370 --> 12:31.150]  Oh, gang member. Wish I had a silencer. Oh, I think if you push up on the deep head you can mark.
[12:31.770 --> 12:37.970]  Gang member right there. Yeah, can we take him out with anything? Uh. I don't have a silenced gun.
[12:37.970 --> 12:43.950]  I have. I have a hammer. Is he saying rock rock bitch titty? What is he saying? I think so. I think
[12:43.950 --> 12:49.390]  this is Vanilla Ice's new single. Regulation moon girl. Thank you for the subs. Wow. Come on boys.
[12:49.630 --> 12:52.710]  Come on boys. We're doing good. This is great. We can cross the bridge over here. Yep. Keep it moving.
[12:52.810 --> 12:59.090]  This is great. We're sneaky little boys. Us and Michael Madsen. Our true angel. Mm-hmm. He's
[12:59.090 --> 13:12.720]  watching over us. Always. This bridge? I'm sure. Why not? I was thinking the other one, but that's fine.
[13:13.400 --> 13:18.920]  We didn't bring a single silenced pistol. Right. Well, I have an AK-47. I don't know if it's silenced.
[13:18.920 --> 13:25.080]  I don't trust it. It's not a bridge. I have an AK-47. I'm gonna go ahead and assume it's not silenced.
[13:25.080 --> 13:33.820]  Yeah. Uh, it's hard to tell. Is it silenced? Does it have a silencer on it? No. No. No. Okay. No, it's just an AK-47.
[13:34.240 --> 13:37.660]  Well, it has like a little weird thing on the barrel. I didn't know if it was like that. That's the barrel.
[13:38.200 --> 13:44.960]  Yeah. The little muzzle end? Yeah, it was kind of a muzzly. Oh, shit. Whoa. Okay, go that way. Great. What a great...
[13:44.960 --> 13:52.160]  Fuck. The bridge is blocked off. We gotta go back, boys. Can we swim it? I don't think so. Andrew, I thought you've played this.
[13:52.160 --> 14:00.260]  Oh, I beat it. Front to back. Can we cross this? Nope. Return to mission area. Damn. I'm going this way. Maybe, uh,
[14:00.620 --> 14:02.720]  under the bridge. Maybe we can go...
[14:02.720 --> 14:04.220]  Yeah. Can we slit throats?
[14:04.900 --> 14:07.820]  I don't... I don't know. I only have a hammer.
[14:10.620 --> 14:13.280]  I've got a shotgun. I've got a revolver.
[14:14.040 --> 14:14.900]  Zipline. Zipline.
[14:15.360 --> 14:18.600]  Eyes. Eyes. Eyes. Eyes. Eyes. You guys are getting noticed. You guys are getting noticed.
[14:19.340 --> 14:20.240]  You got noticed.
[14:21.340 --> 14:22.500]  Nope. We're okay.
[14:23.600 --> 14:24.880]  Gunshot heard. Okay.
[14:25.500 --> 14:26.140]  Who's shotgun?
[14:27.020 --> 14:29.860]  You guys... you guys know... you guys got noticed. We can do this.
[14:30.780 --> 14:31.420]  We can lock in.
[14:32.360 --> 14:32.740]  Who's shotgun?
[14:34.140 --> 14:35.100]  Who's shotgun?
[14:36.520 --> 14:41.480]  Crucified Donkey. Thank you so much, Crucified Donkey. Thanks, Big Donkey.
[14:42.380 --> 14:48.940]  Wow. It says the total gifted in the channel. That's high. That's a lot. Uh, Mark the Frog said, is this game fun?
[14:49.800 --> 14:50.260]  Mark.
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.280]  We're doing this as a tribute to a dead man. Um, yeah. Rest in peace.
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.300]  Only way they're expecting anyway. You know, boats are coming through all the time. Boats?
[15:04.900 --> 15:07.200]  Oh, I'd wait for the couple docked in the canal.
[15:09.600 --> 15:10.060]  Okay.
[15:11.700 --> 15:16.420]  All right. Gavin's got his gun drawn. He's ready to go. I'm a shovelman.
[15:17.380 --> 15:23.980]  Oh, gang member! Back, back, back, back, back. Oh, God! Oh, God! Down. We just go... just go over this way. We can go around, can't we?
[15:24.780 --> 15:25.620]  Can't we? Let's find out.
[15:26.260 --> 15:29.920]  Isn't this leading to like the same place? Yeah, I guess. Is it over here?
[15:30.660 --> 15:35.040]  Guys, can I hit someone on the head with a shovel? What do you think? Uh, one thing's pop off. Yes.
[15:37.760 --> 15:39.120]  I got my crowbar at the right.
[15:39.580 --> 15:46.300]  Let me know if you guys see an X on the ground. Yeah, no problem. Oh, oh, check this out.
[15:46.300 --> 15:50.780]  Check this out. Okay. Where's the gang member? Okay, you get him. Get him. Watch this. Watch this.
[15:54.040 --> 15:55.760]  It worked. That worked.
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.060]  Oh, oh, there's a guy coming. There's a guy coming. There's a guy coming. Oh, oh balls. Oh balls. I put him in a bag.
[16:01.400 --> 16:03.480]  He despawned. No, no, I put him in a bag.
[16:04.460 --> 16:05.300]  You bagged him up?
[16:05.960 --> 16:14.900]  Oh my God. Oh, there you are. Nick, he's in this bag.
[16:16.300 --> 16:18.260]  Give the controller to Archie.
[16:19.420 --> 16:22.420]  I'm gonna put him by the vending machine. Yeah, put him in there.
[16:23.320 --> 16:28.360]  It'll be A1. Oops. Where's, is the gang member still coming? Did he turn? No, he's turned around. No, he turned around.
[16:28.760 --> 16:33.680]  And there's a boat. Man. Hey, what was the button to ping? Uh, up on the d-pad.
[16:34.700 --> 16:37.220]  That's right. How'd you drop it? Oh, there's a water voice.
[16:37.800 --> 16:39.720]  Nick threw him in the water in a bag.
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.020]  Can you imagine waking up uncon- like drowning in a bag?
[16:44.020 --> 16:47.420]  There's a guy, there's a guy behind you, moron.
[16:48.160 --> 16:49.520]  Oh, he wasn't alerting me.
[16:49.920 --> 16:54.360]  He was alerting you. Not to the point it was red. I don't want to hear from you.
[16:54.940 --> 16:56.760]  You're, you are so off.
[16:57.040 --> 16:59.780]  Hey, the boats are here.
[17:00.960 --> 17:04.440]  Game clip recorded. Hey guys, Nick's catching up. The boats are here.
[17:06.420 --> 17:11.620]  I just got a double kill with one shovel swing. Hey, way to go, man.
[17:13.100 --> 17:17.980]  Fucking Vanilla Ice and his sniper. Jesus Christ. Yeah, the sniper's crazy.
[17:21.120 --> 17:26.540]  I'm down. Oh no. Yeah, just restart it again, because now we know where we're supposed to go. Let's just restart it again.
[17:26.900 --> 17:28.160]  How the fuck do you climb a ladder?
[17:29.180 --> 17:29.540]  X?
[17:31.880 --> 17:33.920]  Handle the controller, RG. Doesn't seem to be climbing. Oh, there we go.
[17:34.780 --> 17:36.580]  How'd you do it? I pressed X.
[17:37.720 --> 17:40.940]  I pushed X. Nicky, you were right. Who's shotgun?
[17:43.540 --> 17:45.820]  Sorry, I'm just really panicked about what you have on your signal.
[17:46.620 --> 17:51.320]  The guy in the chat going, hope you guys stream on kick. Yeah, man. Yeah, we're streaming on kick.
[17:53.060 --> 17:57.880]  The fuck is kick? What is that? It's fucking like weirdo right wing streaming site.
[17:58.560 --> 18:01.800]  Like, hey, I got kicked off of YouTube and Twitch. I gotta go to kick.
[18:02.780 --> 18:08.260]  This is where I get all my real info. Yeah, that's absolutely what it is. Guys, watch this. Watch this. Yeah, okay. Shoveling?
[18:09.900 --> 18:15.760]  Every day, I'm shoveling. That's just a guy. That's just a guy. That was a guy asleep.
[18:16.600 --> 18:22.180]  I mean, there's a gang member right there if you really wanted to. Yeah. Should we bag him up? Nah, he's fine.
[18:22.980 --> 18:28.460]  I mean, we probably should have, but whatever. He's fine. Let's keep going. Let's go around. Let's get on the boat.
[18:30.740 --> 18:35.200]  I'm getting, if you can shovel, I'm getting my hammer. Rock Rock City, bitch.
[18:36.620 --> 18:37.860]  I'm hammering, baby.
[18:44.880 --> 18:53.280]  Gang member there. Gavin. I'm going for it. This is my bag. Bagman. And a one. And a two. And a...
[18:53.280 --> 18:58.100]  Oh, I got the other one. Okay. Gang member there. There's definitely some more guys over there. Gang member there. This is exciting.
[18:58.640 --> 19:00.380]  Oh shit, that guy's overlooking the other one.
[19:00.660 --> 19:04.940]  What if we bag four men and we'll take a picture holding our men?
[19:05.200 --> 19:06.820]  Okay. What?
[19:07.960 --> 19:09.720]  We're bagging men.
[19:10.960 --> 19:11.400]  Gang member there.
[19:12.840 --> 19:16.820]  Let's get... Hey, gang member there. We'll be the duffle boys.
[19:17.960 --> 19:20.320]  All right, let's uh...
[19:21.160 --> 19:23.520]  I heard someone go down. Nick!
[19:23.640 --> 19:25.120]  Wait, what happened? Nick!
[19:25.820 --> 19:30.060]  Right in front of people. I heard that. Nick, you fool.
[19:32.040 --> 19:34.020]  We're gonna fight people with this bag.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.420]  Hey, somebody has a shotgun.
[19:42.540 --> 19:44.840]  We just need to get to the other side!
[19:46.340 --> 19:47.420]  It's so short!
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.740]  I want to play... How did the chicken cross the water?
[19:53.520 --> 20:01.860]  You want to play what? I want to play this level and just clunk everyone in the head and throw all the bags of people in the in the river so I'm alone in the level.
[20:02.680 --> 20:03.120]  Just...
[20:04.600 --> 20:05.480]  The silence.
[20:07.740 --> 20:09.860]  Speaking of silence, moment of silence for Michael Madsen.
[20:13.080 --> 20:17.600]  It's so funny that he died. It's sad. I know, that's why I want a moment of silence.
[20:24.200 --> 20:29.820]  It's very funny to have a moment of silence in the background just to hear Vanilla Ice go PARTY!
[20:40.900 --> 20:44.280]  I think we gotta, I think we gotta thump guys down here. Okay.
[20:45.220 --> 20:49.020]  It's clear. This is looking pretty good. Yeah, this might actually, this might actually be okay.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.840]  Guys up above? No, I don't think so. Oh, there's no, there's no boats. There's no boats though. Can we swim over?
[20:56.420 --> 20:59.040]  No, no, we have to jump on boats.
[20:59.800 --> 21:02.900]  Trust me. I know I jumped off the boat like six times. Oh, there's a zipline.
[21:03.580 --> 21:06.080]  Wait, really? Oh, we can zip. Oh, cool.
[21:06.960 --> 21:11.220]  Let's do that. Let's head this way. And let's thump anyone that gets in our way. Yep.
[21:12.380 --> 21:14.200]  How do you pull out your thumping thing?
[21:15.020 --> 21:19.940]  It's just the third weapon. Y, and then yeah, you just keep hitting Y until you get it. Okay. You beat this game?
[21:20.900 --> 21:23.660]  Uh, like three years ago. Okay.
[21:24.460 --> 21:29.340]  How do we get, oh my god, we have to go to the roof? Oh, that's, that guy needs a fight. He just punched his spine.
[21:29.900 --> 21:32.480]  Gavin, Gavin, we got one right up here. You ready? Yeah.
[21:33.080 --> 21:36.220]  All right, come with me and let me know if someone else is coming.
[21:38.540 --> 21:40.680]  All right, you ready? You look good.
[21:43.180 --> 21:44.280]  Bag, boom in the bag.
[21:45.420 --> 21:46.740]  There's a guy in here.
[21:47.560 --> 21:50.620]  Careful, careful. Yeah, yeah. I'll get that guy. No.
[21:52.380 --> 21:57.120]  I'm going to the roof. Yeah. Okay. I tossed a body bag in the trash. No, you got to keep your bag.
[21:57.680 --> 21:58.660]  All right, I'll pick it up.
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.680]  Oh, well, Gavin, you alerted him.
[22:02.240 --> 22:10.500]  I ran back past the window. You sure did. You sprinted past the window. I thought we were supposed to need help. Sure weren't.
[22:13.960 --> 22:17.980]  Oh, fuck, I missed the zipline. Mailbox ejaculator. Okay.
[22:19.220 --> 22:20.800]  What? Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[22:22.260 --> 22:23.920]  Thank you for the subs.
[22:24.760 --> 22:28.640]  Oh, the zipline's great, guys. We gotta do that. Yeah, the thing is, I think the zipline's pretty cool.
[22:28.660 --> 22:30.340]  If it's there still.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.720]  You're gonna run in front of an open window again? Well, if you sprint, it makes noise and that alerts them as well.
[22:38.020 --> 22:40.520]  So just be mindful of that. Good to know.
[22:41.060 --> 22:43.940]  These dudes just hear everything? Yep. Crazy.
[22:45.120 --> 22:50.580]  That's their gang. They're the hearing well gang. Shit is in game with five subs.
[22:53.760 --> 22:55.880]  Oh, there's a guy here now.
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.800]  Right there. Not for long.
[23:01.000 --> 23:01.400]  Easy.
[23:02.440 --> 23:04.600]  It's a race. It's a race. It's a race. It's a race.
[23:04.700 --> 23:10.020]  I got someone else put him in a bag. I have the bag now. I'm the bagman.
[23:10.600 --> 23:12.000]  Bring the bag, Mr. Mitten.
[23:17.690 --> 23:22.790]  God, if I have to hear this one more fucking time. I don't think you're not gonna hear it one more time.
[23:23.150 --> 23:25.690]  There's a guy right where we need to go. Oh, yeah.
[23:26.230 --> 23:27.290]  Hold on. I'll get him.
[23:27.290 --> 23:29.490]  Man. Oh, good try. Good throw.
[23:30.970 --> 23:37.610]  Smash some dogs. Damn, it just goes straight up. There's like no angle to it. Let it. Let it. Let angel main. Got it. Yeah.
[23:38.650 --> 23:39.130]  Almost.
[23:39.830 --> 23:41.330]  There you go. That's the move.
[23:41.450 --> 23:43.230]  From above.
[23:48.870 --> 23:52.830]  We got boats. Oh, we got boats this time. Oh.
[23:52.830 --> 23:55.010]  Sounds all right by me.
[23:55.250 --> 24:01.710]  Get him. Whammo. Bag him up. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Have we got a bag each now? Yeah, bag him. Uh-oh.
[24:03.530 --> 24:05.310]  I threw my bag in the river, but I can bag this guy.
[24:05.650 --> 24:07.870]  Let's all hold our bags at the same time and throw them all.
[24:08.170 --> 24:12.810]  All right. My guy may have been innocent. I can't tell. He had a pink shirt on. Where is uh...
[24:12.810 --> 24:16.510]  Okay, here we go. All right. Ready? How do we look with our bags? Do we look cool? You look great.
[24:17.110 --> 24:19.510]  Let's take a little selfie before you'll tell us. Okay.
[24:19.990 --> 24:21.770]  How do we do that? Look at a lot of men.
[24:22.370 --> 24:27.990]  Do we look cool? Beautiful. All right, cool. Here we go. One, two, three. Chuck him.
[24:32.810 --> 24:34.390]  Oh shit. Okay.
[24:37.110 --> 24:38.270]  Nick fell into the water.
[24:41.170 --> 24:46.770]  People on the bridge, be careful. God damn it. People on the bridge. Oh, you respawned to the first boat, not the second.
[24:48.110 --> 24:49.170]  How do we open this door?
[24:50.350 --> 24:54.770]  I'm trying to remember. What the f... Here he comes. Here he comes. Get ready. Okay, I'm gonna get him.
[24:55.270 --> 24:55.490]  Okay.
[24:56.090 --> 24:56.530]  Whack him.
[24:57.190 --> 24:58.210]  Here he comes, Gavin. Now!
[25:04.050 --> 25:04.970]  Here he is.
[25:07.250 --> 25:11.750]  How's it looking, Andrew? Got it. Got it. Picked it. The door closed and shoved him back into the room.
[25:15.840 --> 25:17.500]  It's the best game ever. Hey, keep going.
[25:17.500 --> 25:22.980]  Where are you gonna put him? Oh my god, there's blood. Oh, look at this door.
[25:25.520 --> 25:27.280]  Yeah, I got a bit carried away.
[25:29.380 --> 25:30.500]  Way to go.
[25:32.900 --> 25:37.180]  Careful. Careful now. Oh, where'd he go? Oh, you bagged him.
[25:37.180 --> 25:39.040]  Throw him in the river.
[25:43.220 --> 25:43.780]  Okay.
[25:46.020 --> 25:52.460]  Dude, throwing him in the river is so funny. What an insult to injury. What a stupid fucking game.
[25:54.700 --> 25:57.820]  I like that we don't bring silencers. We just brought blunt objects.
[26:00.400 --> 26:06.680]  Okay. All right, we're behind you. Oh shit. Careful. Careful. He sees you.
[26:07.420 --> 26:08.460]  Who did he see?
[26:10.480 --> 26:13.460]  He just executed some different man. Oh.
[26:14.220 --> 26:16.580]  He did? Yeah, he just shot a guy on his knees.
[26:17.460 --> 26:21.560]  Oh, there's a... we can go this way. Oh, I think it's still kicking off now. Let's just open fire.
[26:22.900 --> 26:27.060]  All right, well, we made it a good long way. Are you opening this door or just looking at it?
[26:27.060 --> 26:31.000]  I'm trying. I'm trying to pick it. There we go. Okay. It just doesn't look like you're doing anything. Okay. Yeah.
[26:32.180 --> 26:32.640]  We're in.
[26:34.200 --> 26:38.360]  What's that? I was already in. There's an open door over here. Okay, well.
[26:40.740 --> 26:45.540]  What's that? There's an open door over here. Eric's trying to blow me up. No, no.
[26:47.660 --> 26:48.180]  Eric!
[26:51.260 --> 26:51.780]  What?
[26:53.420 --> 26:55.580]  What? He said use the fireworks.
[26:57.100 --> 26:58.160]  Search the trucks.
[26:59.080 --> 27:02.300]  I thought you would think it's cool. What a yell that was.
[27:02.640 --> 27:03.880]  Get him down and hurt him.
[27:05.760 --> 27:08.020]  Okay, get in the buzzsaw.
[27:10.520 --> 27:13.180]  Reload like you gotta do something, man. Come on.
[27:14.820 --> 27:17.540]  Wow, that took a long way to get over here. You got the buzzsaw, Andrew? Yeah, I'm getting it.
[27:18.060 --> 27:19.700]  That'll work. We call you Buzzsaw?
[27:20.360 --> 27:20.680]  Absolutely.
[27:21.940 --> 27:24.380]  Gizmo, middle name Buzzsaw, last name Patton.
[27:25.160 --> 27:25.940]  I threw a brick.
[27:26.780 --> 27:31.480]  I threw a brick with right bumper. Good job. Good job. Thanks, man. Dude, I'm getting rizzled.
[27:32.660 --> 27:33.780]  You know the Rizzlers?
[27:35.240 --> 27:36.740]  Oh, they're behind us. Behind the van.
[27:38.580 --> 27:39.700]  Ouch. What the fuck?
[27:42.760 --> 27:47.720]  Die. Dude, I'm always holding up to get down. Pushing them back. Don't do that, you'll die.
[27:49.640 --> 27:51.760]  I'm almost holding up to get down.
[27:54.220 --> 27:58.860]  The slowest buzzsaw in the world. I want to kill this sniper, but I just don't know if we can.
[27:59.880 --> 28:05.180]  We can, once we do all the other bullshit objectives. But you can't kill him before that? No, no, no.
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.100]  That's so stupid. You can see him and shoot him, but it won't let you. That's so funny. Yeah.
[28:11.840 --> 28:13.380]  So many of them spawning over there.
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.020]  Oh, yeah, dude, you're good at this go-by-two-times thing, huh? Yeah, who shoot me? Who shoot?
[28:18.200 --> 28:20.540]  Yeah, there's a sniper up there, like the left, Nick.
[28:21.340 --> 28:22.340]  I don't think the sniper...
[28:24.280 --> 28:25.740]  I'm holding to speed up.
[28:26.880 --> 28:31.760]  Who turned it off? You. You overheated it. You overheated it.
[28:32.500 --> 28:34.380]  The meter wasn't near the top, but all right.
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.400]  Ow, I got pushed. Sniper on you, sniper on you. Fucking sniper. Yeah, dude, that sniper got you good.
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.320]  Please be the right truck.
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.440]  Oh, it could be the wrong truck? Yeah. The way we came from, there's two of them. Someone's walking in my face.
[28:53.360 --> 28:58.820]  Wish I didn't have a shotgun. Can you, can you hit, uh, hit what? Oh, you don't have a different gun?
[28:59.020 --> 29:03.580]  I have a pistol. Oh, that's it. Fucking empty. Truck's empty. Going to the other one.
[29:04.240 --> 29:05.460]  Son of a bitch.
[29:06.260 --> 29:07.620]  We almost wasted a saw blade.
[29:09.740 --> 29:12.060]  He's coming up to hit you guys for some reason.
[29:12.280 --> 29:17.540]  Oh, he wants to hit? I'll take my shovel out. It's fucked up. It's really hard because these gang members look just like Gavin.
[29:18.520 --> 29:19.240]  Yeah, they really do.
[29:19.360 --> 29:20.780]  I just see a bald-ass head.
[29:20.780 --> 29:27.420]  Doing bald-ass behavior, and it's just like all of a sudden. It's 16 of the same man.
[29:29.320 --> 29:33.400]  All right, I've pinged the sniper. Yeah, but we can't kill him.
[29:36.760 --> 29:42.160]  You won't get a kill shot from your position. Yeah, I bet I could. Yeah, me too, and it just won't let you.
[29:43.300 --> 29:44.760]  Are you getting grizzled or what's up?
[29:46.600 --> 29:48.680]  Is the Rizzler here or what are you talking about?
[29:50.480 --> 29:51.620]  R.I.P. to the Rizzler.
[29:52.360 --> 29:54.020]  Nah, I was just getting rinsed.
[29:56.580 --> 29:58.980]  I hit a button to fire on the stage.
[29:58.980 --> 29:59.420]  The stage fire?
[30:00.400 --> 30:02.400]  Yeah, I don't know what that does, but I did it.
[30:02.800 --> 30:05.040]  I pressed it, and he said what did you do that for?
[30:07.080 --> 30:08.160]  Okay, truck's almost open.
[30:08.520 --> 30:09.380]  Oh, what the hell was that?
[30:11.080 --> 30:12.400]  He said it to me also.
[30:14.520 --> 30:16.240]  Oh, it's like pinging where they are.
[30:17.440 --> 30:18.800]  Like a scan grenade?
[30:18.980 --> 30:20.480]  Yeah, you have like a little ping grenade.
[30:21.100 --> 30:21.340]  Yeah.
[30:22.020 --> 30:23.600]  I got a tape recorder.
[30:24.500 --> 30:25.600]  Okay, get ready, fireworks.
[30:26.140 --> 30:27.360]  Oh, there's more guys, more guys.
[30:29.240 --> 30:30.140]  Fireworks, let's go!
[30:31.700 --> 30:32.880]  Well, it's still closed.
[30:35.320 --> 30:36.220]  Alright, let's go boys.
[30:36.380 --> 30:37.200]  Load em, load em.
[30:37.540 --> 30:38.680]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[30:40.020 --> 30:41.080]  Which way is it?
[30:41.440 --> 30:42.300]  The sniper's on Andrew.
[30:42.300 --> 30:43.660]  Up here.
[30:43.740 --> 30:44.300]  Follow me.
[30:45.160 --> 30:47.640]  I just ran past a lot of people with a gun at my head.
[30:47.740 --> 30:48.940]  Yeah, it's fine.
[30:50.740 --> 30:51.520]  That's one.
[30:52.420 --> 30:53.620]  Gavin and I each have one.
[30:53.940 --> 30:54.860]  All the way up here.
[30:55.320 --> 30:56.300]  We need one more.
[30:56.900 --> 30:57.900]  Nick didn't bring one.
[30:58.420 --> 30:59.240]  Where is it?
[31:01.760 --> 31:03.260]  Are you a sausage?
[31:05.020 --> 31:08.200]  What do you think we're doing here?
[31:10.240 --> 31:10.720]  Uh...
[31:10.720 --> 31:11.840]  Covering each other?
[31:11.980 --> 31:14.360]  You see three guys running up the stairs with boxes
[31:14.360 --> 31:15.820]  and you think, I'll go as well.
[31:16.500 --> 31:17.900]  That's right, me too.
[31:17.920 --> 31:18.580]  I have the gun.
[31:19.140 --> 31:23.080]  No, you don't. That's why you're carrying a box of fireworks.
[31:23.080 --> 31:25.000]  It's his job to ping Vanilla Ice.
[31:25.140 --> 31:25.760]  He's doing great.
[31:26.120 --> 31:27.420]  Yeah, and I pinged him real well.
[31:27.460 --> 31:27.920]  Away!
[31:37.240 --> 31:38.200]  Now what?
[31:38.640 --> 31:41.120]  We gotta disrupt the audio or some shit, I think.
[31:42.260 --> 31:43.560]  Hey! Who's shooting me?
[31:45.540 --> 31:47.040]  Oh, there's like a lot of guys.
[31:47.240 --> 31:48.920]  What does it mean he's down but he's hiding?
[31:51.720 --> 31:53.360]  He's behind the cover or something, I don't know.
[31:59.360 --> 32:02.780]  I don't think you can say that.
[32:03.160 --> 32:04.160]  I don't think you can either.
[32:04.200 --> 32:06.200]  You're getting buffed by the tunes.
[32:09.920 --> 32:10.960]  Oh god!
[32:11.100 --> 32:12.040]  I put the tape in!
[32:12.400 --> 32:13.380]  Tape in, go!
[32:16.460 --> 32:20.720]  What'd you do that for?
[32:20.960 --> 32:22.800]  I just keep doing it.
[32:24.660 --> 32:26.000]  We gotta get Carlos!
[32:27.040 --> 32:27.820]  Where's Carlos?
[32:27.980 --> 32:28.860]  On the stage!
[32:30.120 --> 32:32.220]  Why is he shooting dubstep around?
[32:32.220 --> 32:32.740]  Oh, he's dead.
[32:34.380 --> 32:35.160]  Vanilla Ice!
[32:35.160 --> 32:37.160]  Oh no! Guy right on me!
[32:37.440 --> 32:37.920]  Grenades!
[32:41.140 --> 32:42.100]  Are you...
[32:42.100 --> 32:43.140]  I'm down.
[32:44.580 --> 32:46.180]  Why is there gas everywhere?
[32:47.100 --> 32:49.260]  Out of my back! My back plug!
[32:49.880 --> 32:51.220]  He has so much health!
[32:52.200 --> 32:53.380]  I'm coming, Nick. I'm reviving you.
[32:53.660 --> 32:55.020]  Just keep firing!
[32:55.420 --> 32:58.340]  I got you, Gavin!
[32:59.300 --> 33:00.260]  Use the pyro!
[33:00.920 --> 33:02.400]  Now he wants to know what you did that for.
[33:05.260 --> 33:05.700]  Pyro!
[33:08.800 --> 33:09.240]  Pyro!
[33:10.840 --> 33:11.120]  Pyro!
[33:13.020 --> 33:13.900]  Firing fireworks!
[33:15.260 --> 33:16.520]  Oh, they're already used. Never mind.
[33:16.760 --> 33:17.780]  Never mind! False alarm!
[33:21.580 --> 33:22.440]  I did it!
[33:25.020 --> 33:25.460]  Ah!
[33:26.080 --> 33:27.320]  Oh, bad. Bad, bad, bad.
[33:27.480 --> 33:27.900]  Pyro!
[33:36.460 --> 33:36.820]  Pyro!
[33:37.760 --> 33:39.800]  Oh, shoot out the left one. The left one, Andrew. Do it.
[33:40.100 --> 33:40.560]  Oh, I got it.
[33:41.460 --> 33:41.820]  Pyro!
[33:43.260 --> 33:43.980]  Shooting across.
[33:47.040 --> 33:47.920]  He's almost at half.
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.340]  I plinked his ribs out.
[33:50.840 --> 33:51.880]  Okay, I'm getting him on this side.
[33:52.260 --> 33:54.120]  Let me go up the freaking stage!
[33:56.680 --> 33:57.320]  Nick's down.
[33:57.880 --> 33:58.460]  I'm down.
[33:59.040 --> 34:00.120]  I'm right behind you, Gavin.
[34:00.120 --> 34:01.380]  I got him. I got him. I got you.
[34:02.440 --> 34:04.320]  Gavin, you're getting...
[34:04.320 --> 34:05.360]  You're getting smoked out.
[34:05.980 --> 34:07.960]  Thank you. Next one, I die.
[34:09.820 --> 34:11.120]  I got a pyro!
[34:17.330 --> 34:17.690]  Pyro!
[34:19.610 --> 34:23.070]  Oh, god damn it!
[34:23.670 --> 34:25.090]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen!
[34:26.450 --> 34:27.970]  I wish I could take this guy with a shovel.
[34:27.970 --> 34:28.250]  Slick is dead!
[34:31.490 --> 34:32.590]  Try to burn him with that.
[34:33.030 --> 34:34.070]  Burn him with it!
[34:34.350 --> 34:36.710]  There's Joker gas all over the field!
[34:37.070 --> 34:39.870]  He's taking out Gotham!
[34:43.590 --> 34:46.270]  I set off the fucking middle one!
[34:47.730 --> 34:49.210]  Come on, die, die, die!
[34:49.850 --> 34:50.190]  Get down!
[34:50.390 --> 34:51.010]  He's so weak!
[34:51.910 --> 34:52.910]  I'm gonna take him!
[34:53.690 --> 34:54.490]  He's down!
[34:57.550 --> 34:59.030]  We beat it!
[34:59.030 --> 34:59.190]  We beat it!
[35:00.990 --> 35:02.270]  We gotta get out of here!
[35:02.390 --> 35:02.730]  To the van!
[35:03.810 --> 35:04.550]  Where's that?
[35:05.010 --> 35:06.850]  Across the bridge, right?
[35:08.250 --> 35:10.110]  Ready for SWAT!
[35:10.190 --> 35:11.630]  Here it comes!
[35:12.610 --> 35:13.430]  Where's the van?
[35:13.870 --> 35:16.030]  What the hell?
[35:19.820 --> 35:20.600]  They managed to hit
[35:20.600 --> 35:21.680]  each and every one of you.
[35:21.700 --> 35:21.840]  Let me in!
[35:23.900 --> 35:24.940]  Start escape!
[35:25.160 --> 35:25.820]  Ending mission!
[35:25.820 --> 35:27.700]  I'm not in!
[35:28.140 --> 35:29.420]  We did it!
[35:30.600 --> 35:32.360]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen!
[35:34.260 --> 35:37.680]  Hey, we all did it!
[35:37.720 --> 35:39.440]  Guys, what a success that was.
[35:39.800 --> 35:41.020]  All of us made it.
[35:41.440 --> 35:42.640]  Stop Vanilla Ice.
[35:43.740 --> 35:45.660]  The whole time I was getting text messages
[35:45.660 --> 35:46.360]  from Gus.
[35:47.800 --> 35:50.200]  Yeah, I know, I have no idea.
[35:50.620 --> 35:51.080]  Like, what?
[35:51.420 --> 35:52.900]  I would never say this to him.
[35:52.900 --> 35:53.560]  Leave me alone!
[35:53.940 --> 35:55.780]  I'm trying to kill Vanilla Ice.
[35:57.520 --> 35:58.420]  Johan's back
[35:58.420 --> 35:59.720]  with the five gifted subs.
[35:59.860 --> 36:02.280]  Thanks for that.
[36:03.600 --> 36:05.560]  Oh, I'm level 21 now.
[36:06.340 --> 36:07.500]  I'm level 4.
[36:07.820 --> 36:09.380]  Now the whole game is opened up.
[36:10.960 --> 36:12.340]  Oh, we did it, eh?
[36:12.600 --> 36:14.740]  Oh, wait, I gotta pick a magazine or something?
[36:15.560 --> 36:16.920]  Yeah, we gotta do something shovel-y.
[36:17.100 --> 36:18.580]  What the hell is this?
[36:19.000 --> 36:19.600]  Oh, a silencer?
[36:19.600 --> 36:21.320]  The magazine, so you can
[36:21.320 --> 36:22.300]  unlock stuff.
[36:22.840 --> 36:24.680]  I wanna unlock the silenced bip.
[36:26.500 --> 36:27.520]  Okay, so let's go
[36:27.520 --> 36:29.420]  missions. You wanna do a heist?
[36:30.160 --> 36:31.320]  Uh, I wanna do something
[36:31.320 --> 36:32.340]  that is very
[36:34.120 --> 36:35.500]  hammer and shovel focused.
[36:36.020 --> 36:36.200]  Yeah.
[36:36.400 --> 36:36.600]  Hmm.
[36:39.200 --> 36:41.220]  Oh, this guy's a silencer, hell yeah.
[36:44.130 --> 36:45.090]  That's what I'm talking about.
[36:45.110 --> 36:46.230]  Well, let's do a...
[36:46.230 --> 36:48.590]  We'll be the shovel robbers, and we can
[36:49.350 --> 36:50.490]  rob from
[36:51.590 --> 36:52.750]  Jorky Belfus.
[36:52.970 --> 36:54.750]  Thanks for the 10 gifted subs.
[36:55.030 --> 36:56.530]  Afford him yet, even though I just
[36:57.170 --> 36:58.030]  unlocked him?
[36:58.170 --> 37:00.640]  I have Flavio. I am Flavio!
[37:04.070 --> 37:04.650]  Brick?
[37:05.130 --> 37:06.630]  No, I don't want that.
[37:07.730 --> 37:08.190]  Okay.
[37:09.090 --> 37:09.850]  I think I'm ready.
[37:10.390 --> 37:11.290]  I've readied up.
[37:12.390 --> 37:13.690]  I am Flavio.
[37:14.370 --> 37:15.910]  I look like I'm into Oasis.
[37:15.910 --> 37:17.550]  Jorky Belfus!
[37:19.570 --> 37:22.070]  My name is no longer Flavio.
[37:22.190 --> 37:23.770]  It is Jorky Belfus.
[37:24.370 --> 37:25.230]  Hey, Jorky.
[37:26.570 --> 37:27.110]  Oops.
[37:27.610 --> 37:29.150]  Does Archie like this game, Nick?
[37:30.330 --> 37:32.030]  Uh, well, based on
[37:32.030 --> 37:34.090]  his reaction when he was pulled from the room, yeah.
[37:34.270 --> 37:35.630]  Pulled from the room!
[37:36.950 --> 37:38.070]  He got yoinked.
[37:38.710 --> 37:39.610]  He got yoinked, yeah.
[37:40.090 --> 37:41.950]  I do like the idea of trying
[37:41.950 --> 37:43.450]  to, uh...
[37:43.450 --> 37:45.490]  We should do, like, a Let's Play where I'm
[37:45.490 --> 37:47.370]  trying to avoid everything while you guys actually
[37:47.370 --> 37:48.290]  have action happening.
[37:49.310 --> 37:51.330]  Just like Death Stranding it, and it's all
[37:51.330 --> 37:53.390]  tranquilizer bullets. Nobody's actually getting
[37:53.390 --> 37:54.770]  hurt. Everyone's just going to sleep.
[37:55.410 --> 37:57.510]  Yep. Yeah. Uh, are we not ready
[37:57.510 --> 37:59.350]  or something, or what's going on? Oh, we sure are. I gotta hold X.
[37:59.450 --> 38:01.290]  I just assumed it would do that if we all readied up.
[38:01.350 --> 38:03.330]  Sorry about that. Oh, another five
[38:03.330 --> 38:05.650]  from Wildo or Wildo61.
[38:06.290 --> 38:07.290]  Thank you so much!
[38:08.110 --> 38:09.110]  I like, I like Wildo.
[38:10.870 --> 38:11.670]  Like Nintendo.
[38:12.470 --> 38:14.110]  Yeah, that's what it's like, yeah.
[38:14.110 --> 38:16.210]  Yeah, not like Waldo. That's not what I was thinking.
[38:16.450 --> 38:17.810]  Yeah, that's also, yeah.
[38:17.950 --> 38:19.810]  I definitely wasn't thinking Dildo. It's fine.
[38:19.990 --> 38:20.790]  Yeah, it's fine.
[38:21.430 --> 38:22.530]  Now that you say it.
[38:24.190 --> 38:25.690]  Waldo isn't a thing in England
[38:25.690 --> 38:28.010]  because it's Wally. Oh, that's right.
[38:28.410 --> 38:29.090]  That's right.
[38:29.790 --> 38:31.790]  Dildo's only got one L. What the fuck is this?
[38:33.270 --> 38:34.070]  Do I look like
[38:34.070 --> 38:35.330]  Dorkus Bilfus or whatever?
[38:35.450 --> 38:36.250]  Do I look...
[38:37.990 --> 38:39.730]  Dorkus Bilfus? Yeah, you guys...
[38:41.670 --> 38:43.290]  You look like little Ally Chav.
[38:43.750 --> 38:45.830]  Yeah, I definitely feel like
[38:45.830 --> 38:47.110]  I look like I listen to Oasis.
[38:48.450 --> 38:49.690]  That plane's really low.
[38:49.790 --> 38:51.110]  The plane just flew by.
[38:52.110 --> 38:53.190]  But for how long, Gavin?
[38:54.490 --> 38:55.730]  At least until tonight.
[38:56.150 --> 38:56.590]  Guard? Yeah.
[38:57.890 --> 38:58.890]  Oh, shovel time.
[38:59.670 --> 39:01.290]  Yeah, I got my hammer out.
[39:01.930 --> 39:03.050]  Nick's going for it with the crowbar.
[39:03.210 --> 39:04.570]  We'll see who gets there first.
[39:05.050 --> 39:05.450]  What?
[39:13.910 --> 39:14.310]  Stricesticious
[39:14.310 --> 39:15.610]  activity reported.
[39:16.190 --> 39:18.430]  Hey, I found a vent.
[39:19.410 --> 39:20.650]  Oh, we gotta crack them open
[39:20.650 --> 39:22.230]  to try to find the gear, I think.
[39:22.690 --> 39:23.130]  Oh, okay.
[39:24.090 --> 39:25.050]  There's nothing in this one.
[39:25.730 --> 39:26.910]  There's a people bin.
[39:28.910 --> 39:30.050]  Drop them in the air vents.
[39:30.050 --> 39:31.090]  There's nothing in this one.
[39:32.630 --> 39:33.370]  Where's the lake?
[39:34.210 --> 39:35.390]  I couldn't get them in there.
[39:36.150 --> 39:37.610]  Oh, you couldn't? I just put them on top.
[39:38.090 --> 39:40.530]  Alright, let's toss them off the lit sign.
[39:41.230 --> 39:41.850]  Alright, what about this?
[39:42.210 --> 39:42.730]  What about this one?
[39:44.250 --> 39:44.630]  Nope.
[39:45.250 --> 39:45.890]  What are you thinking?
[39:47.170 --> 39:48.010]  Nothing here.
[39:49.810 --> 39:50.650]  Opening event.
[39:52.110 --> 39:52.530]  Empty.
[39:54.370 --> 39:55.090]  Where the fuck?
[39:55.210 --> 39:56.570]  There's a cop around here somewhere.
[39:56.570 --> 39:57.870]  Gavin, how about this?
[39:58.350 --> 39:59.670]  I see it. I see the shit.
[40:00.050 --> 40:01.770]  Getting it.
[40:02.370 --> 40:03.210]  Hold it from the vent.
[40:05.590 --> 40:06.630]  Hey, Nick, what about this?
[40:06.890 --> 40:07.730]  Setting up the ropes.
[40:08.210 --> 40:09.750]  You got the ropes? Let's set up the ropes.
[40:11.110 --> 40:12.470]  Oh my god.
[40:14.990 --> 40:16.470]  What did you do?
[40:19.530 --> 40:22.590]  I'm gonna go ahead and rappel down.
[40:23.630 --> 40:24.430]  Dropping down.
[40:25.070 --> 40:26.090]  Guys, I'm down.
[40:26.310 --> 40:28.190]  Maybe I can find Tank's body?
[40:31.330 --> 40:32.490]  Where's Tank's body?
[40:33.050 --> 40:33.890]  I took the shortcut.
[40:34.210 --> 40:35.450]  He's just straight up dead.
[40:35.890 --> 40:38.390]  Is this you? I found Tank!
[40:38.710 --> 40:40.050]  Tank's over here!
[40:43.190 --> 40:44.750]  Nick did the same thing.
[40:44.930 --> 40:46.010]  Alright, Andrew, it's me and you.
[40:48.230 --> 40:49.110]  That's Tank.
[40:49.150 --> 40:50.190]  Do you have a microphone?
[40:51.030 --> 40:51.410]  Yeah.
[40:53.270 --> 40:54.610]  Let me find Nick's body.
[40:54.730 --> 40:56.230]  I think I saw him ragdoll.
[40:56.450 --> 40:59.290]  Yeah, I just saw Nick's body sloughed down the side of the greenhouse.
[41:00.210 --> 41:00.990]  Where is he?
[41:02.150 --> 41:03.370]  Well, let's keep moving.
[41:05.170 --> 41:06.690]  Okay, yeah, Eric, you and I
[41:06.690 --> 41:08.090]  just drop down, I guess.
[41:09.170 --> 41:11.230]  I don't think we're supposed to go this way.
[41:11.270 --> 41:12.990]  I think we gotta go...
[41:12.990 --> 41:14.830]  Oh, there's a ladder. Ladder over here.
[41:17.510 --> 41:18.270]  Going down.
[41:19.710 --> 41:21.090]  Oh, we both found
[41:21.090 --> 41:21.790]  different ladders.
[41:21.930 --> 41:24.010]  That was a unison.
[41:24.210 --> 41:26.590]  How do you lockpick?
[41:27.750 --> 41:28.550]  Line up
[41:28.550 --> 41:30.510]  the little dash thing
[41:30.510 --> 41:31.650]  on the right trigger, yeah.
[41:32.850 --> 41:34.210]  There's no way to get in
[41:34.210 --> 41:36.310]  from my side. My side's just
[41:36.310 --> 41:36.870]  fucked.
[41:37.850 --> 41:39.550]  I wish we could spectate our bodies, Nick.
[41:39.990 --> 41:40.650]  I'm coming to your way.
[41:42.110 --> 41:43.530]  They did run past one of ours.
[41:43.750 --> 41:46.090]  Yeah, spectate to me for a minute. I can show Gavin's body.
[41:46.090 --> 41:46.630]  I'm on ya.
[41:47.290 --> 41:50.070]  Let's see, look. This is Gavin.
[41:50.550 --> 41:52.350]  This is Tank. Tank right there.
[41:54.130 --> 41:55.250]  They made it.
[41:56.630 --> 41:58.250]  I'm not seeing Nick.
[41:58.450 --> 41:59.470]  I could've sworn...
[41:59.470 --> 42:00.770]  Oh, I laughed so hard I cried.
[42:04.010 --> 42:05.470]  Coming to you, Eric.
[42:07.030 --> 42:07.610]  Andrew!
[42:09.110 --> 42:09.390]  Okay.
[42:10.590 --> 42:11.510]  In my defense,
[42:11.850 --> 42:14.650]  that did not look far enough to down me.
[42:14.650 --> 42:16.990]  What are you talking? But there's a ladder.
[42:17.190 --> 42:18.830]  So what's the point? Use the ladder.
[42:19.230 --> 42:20.890]  It takes a while to do that.
[42:21.170 --> 42:22.650]  I felt like I'd take damage,
[42:22.870 --> 42:23.890]  but I wouldn't down.
[42:25.170 --> 42:25.550]  Anyway.
[42:26.390 --> 42:28.910]  He was like 60. His legs can't take that.
[42:28.970 --> 42:29.270]  That's true.
[42:30.990 --> 42:32.830]  And now he's dead. Rest in peace.
[42:33.270 --> 42:33.750]  Rest in peace.
[42:34.710 --> 42:35.570]  Guy over there.
[42:37.410 --> 42:38.230]  Don't go in there.
[42:38.490 --> 42:39.150]  Don't go in there.
[42:40.890 --> 42:42.110]  Don't go in there.
[42:42.110 --> 42:42.870]  You maniac.
[42:43.390 --> 42:44.190]  Go in with the hammer.
[42:46.330 --> 42:47.990]  I think that gets the suspicion.
[42:49.470 --> 42:49.970]  What's up?
[42:50.370 --> 42:51.050]  What do you want me to do, Gavin?
[42:51.190 --> 42:52.850]  Thump to both with the hammer real quick.
[42:52.870 --> 42:54.150]  You got it, man.
[42:55.070 --> 42:56.430]  Let's sync up, Eric, you and I.
[42:58.150 --> 42:58.730]  Cop coming.
[42:59.230 --> 43:00.170]  This guy's coming.
[43:01.810 --> 43:03.210]  We gotta wait for him to turn the corner.
[43:04.470 --> 43:05.110]  Hang on.
[43:06.630 --> 43:06.990]  Okay.
[43:08.350 --> 43:09.290]  Alright, fuck you.
[43:13.970 --> 43:15.430]  Oh, they can see it.
[43:15.470 --> 43:16.130]  It alerts.
[43:16.350 --> 43:17.570]  Oh, we're about to go loud.
[43:17.970 --> 43:18.710]  What do you mean?
[43:27.530 --> 43:28.390]  We're good, we're good.
[43:28.470 --> 43:29.830]  We're in a restricted area, but we're alright.
[43:29.990 --> 43:30.490]  We're fine.
[43:31.050 --> 43:31.910]  I'm bagging him.
[43:34.830 --> 43:35.830]  Oh, there's the office.
[43:36.350 --> 43:37.170]  Isn't that where we need to go?
[43:37.170 --> 43:38.530]  Uh, control room.
[43:39.950 --> 43:41.170]  Oh, so not the office?
[43:41.410 --> 43:41.970]  I don't know.
[43:43.450 --> 43:44.050]  I'm going down.
[43:46.210 --> 43:47.430]  Oh, there's a guy coming up.
[43:49.430 --> 43:51.290]  That is the biggest camera
[43:51.290 --> 43:52.190]  I've ever seen.
[43:52.730 --> 43:53.510]  Who are you?
[43:53.870 --> 43:54.370]  Who are you?
[43:56.530 --> 43:57.030]  Eric.
[43:58.390 --> 44:00.550]  He was just shooting the shit by the water cooler.
[44:01.450 --> 44:02.390]  I got the camera.
[44:03.450 --> 44:03.850]  Good work.
[44:03.850 --> 44:04.790]  Did you see Love Island last night?
[44:04.810 --> 44:05.530]  Oh my god.
[44:07.650 --> 44:08.090]  Shit.
[44:10.130 --> 44:11.010]  What happened?
[44:11.110 --> 44:11.850]  What'd you do, Andrew?
[44:12.150 --> 44:14.270]  I was punching everybody.
[44:18.330 --> 44:19.910]  I'll kill you all.
[44:20.410 --> 44:21.210]  Shit, okay.
[44:21.290 --> 44:22.310]  That's not the room.
[44:23.650 --> 44:25.110]  Oh, I see control room.
[44:25.730 --> 44:26.070]  Let's go.
[44:27.990 --> 44:30.670]  For a split second, Eric was after his own reflection.
[44:31.170 --> 44:31.850]  Got the keys.
[44:31.850 --> 44:33.030]  Let's do it.
[44:33.850 --> 44:35.390]  Open the skylight?
[44:35.530 --> 44:36.850]  Open the skylight.
[44:37.030 --> 44:37.910]  I'm going for it.
[44:38.990 --> 44:39.550]  Oh!
[44:41.470 --> 44:44.530]  Okay, skylight's opening.
[44:45.030 --> 44:45.850]  Skylight's opening.
[44:46.790 --> 44:47.470]  Oh, we got a vault.
[44:48.250 --> 44:49.030]  Get to the vault.
[44:52.310 --> 44:53.490]  Let's remake Heat,
[44:53.590 --> 44:54.450]  but we'll add this character.
[44:56.350 --> 44:57.470]  Coming 2026.
[44:57.890 --> 44:58.770]  Heat with Hammers.
[45:02.950 --> 45:03.890]  C4 in it.
[45:04.090 --> 45:05.330]  C4 it.
[45:06.610 --> 45:08.450]  I just realized Danny Glover's
[45:08.450 --> 45:10.250]  talking to us while we're doing this.
[45:11.010 --> 45:11.490]  Oh, gloves?
[45:11.910 --> 45:12.870]  We got gloves.
[45:13.370 --> 45:14.110]  Danny Gloves.
[45:18.690 --> 45:19.850]  Find the
[45:19.850 --> 45:21.670]  dragon dogs. Okay, I'm putting a
[45:21.670 --> 45:23.030]  drill on this.
[45:26.130 --> 45:27.290]  Da dogs.
[45:27.490 --> 45:28.470]  Da dogs!
[45:29.070 --> 45:30.590]  I'd be willing to add it to
[45:30.590 --> 45:32.270]  your hot dog count if you get this right.
[45:32.710 --> 45:33.670]  Eric's just a hot dog dispenser.
[45:33.950 --> 45:36.410]  He's just thumping men coming out of a letterbox.
[45:39.150 --> 45:40.930]  No dogs allowed!
[45:45.150 --> 45:46.410]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[45:46.770 --> 45:47.410]  Boosted back up again.
[45:47.410 --> 45:48.490]  This looks fun.
[45:49.110 --> 45:50.570]  It is. It's a really good time.
[45:50.750 --> 45:51.970]  I'm actually really liking this one.
[45:53.470 --> 45:54.070]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[45:56.530 --> 45:57.730]  Dear God.
[45:58.610 --> 45:59.630]  We're about to
[45:59.630 --> 46:00.930]  pass through in the vault.
[46:01.330 --> 46:04.410]  Sorry I got excited. No dogs allowed!
[46:06.070 --> 46:07.270]  Oh, he's still alive.
[46:07.390 --> 46:08.150]  Oh, Hammers so good.
[46:12.660 --> 46:13.260]  Ohh.
[46:13.380 --> 46:14.920]  I think I overheated it.
[46:15.740 --> 46:16.520]  I got too excited.
[46:17.440 --> 46:18.480]  I was thinking about the dogs.
[46:19.740 --> 46:20.640]  Restarting the drill.
[46:21.440 --> 46:23.780]  Attack now and you will push them back.
[46:26.420 --> 46:28.100]  Oh, I'm taking damage, I'm taking damage.
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.620]  I'm unleashing my inner dog.
[46:38.960 --> 46:40.920]  You have a window. Finish up.
[46:41.500 --> 46:42.920]  We're trying, we're trying, we're trying.
[46:43.720 --> 46:45.400]  I got it, I'm locked in three times.
[46:45.720 --> 46:46.340]  Here we go, here we go.
[46:47.660 --> 46:49.400]  Ah, fuck, dammit!
[46:49.600 --> 46:50.480]  You blew it, you blew it.
[46:50.760 --> 46:53.300]  Now who's the fucking dog?
[46:53.840 --> 46:54.640]  Now who's the dog?
[46:55.380 --> 46:57.080]  Now who's the dog?!
[46:57.080 --> 47:00.620]  Eric, see if you can spray a bit of lube over the drill while Andrew's drilling.
[47:01.880 --> 47:02.640]  It's about to open!
[47:03.560 --> 47:04.940]  Okay, I'm spraying lube.
[47:05.960 --> 47:06.180]  Yeah!
[47:10.560 --> 47:12.240]  Oh, we got the dogs!
[47:13.680 --> 47:15.160]  Steal loot! Steal loot!
[47:15.160 --> 47:17.400]  Steal loot! Steal loot!
[47:17.400 --> 47:18.520]  Where the hell are you going to put all that?
[47:18.540 --> 47:20.480]  Steal loot! Steal loot!
[47:21.260 --> 47:22.040]  We're dogs!
[47:22.640 --> 47:23.920]  Go dogs!
[47:24.640 --> 47:25.540]  Dog trolley, go!
[47:26.720 --> 47:27.320]  Steal loot!
[47:28.960 --> 47:29.800]  I'm looted up.
[47:30.300 --> 47:30.840]  It's wheeling!
[47:33.720 --> 47:34.980]  Don't worry, I got you covered.
[47:35.240 --> 47:35.580]  Ah!
[47:36.400 --> 47:37.740]  How are these moving?
[47:38.760 --> 47:39.920]  What is happening?
[47:40.460 --> 47:41.220]  That's flashbang!
[47:41.220 --> 47:41.700]  We're dogs!
[47:44.800 --> 47:45.500]  Restarting drill!
[47:45.960 --> 47:47.360]  We can do another one?
[47:47.900 --> 47:49.340]  We can do as many of these as we want.
[47:49.420 --> 47:50.700]  We can get bonus cash.
[47:51.120 --> 47:54.240]  Do you guys just see me go green times three?
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.140]  Do you guys just fucking see that?
[47:56.960 --> 47:58.080]  Oh yeah, this is...
[47:58.080 --> 47:59.340]  You guys fucking wish.
[48:00.320 --> 48:02.440]  Yeah, that's what happens when you mess with the dog.
[48:03.060 --> 48:03.800]  You get the horns.
[48:07.660 --> 48:08.480]  Classic me.
[48:08.620 --> 48:09.940]  First one's loaded.
[48:10.960 --> 48:11.860]  What's this?
[48:12.040 --> 48:12.660]  What's this?
[48:12.800 --> 48:13.120]  Steal loot!
[48:13.660 --> 48:13.940]  Yeah!
[48:14.580 --> 48:15.880]  Take the loot!
[48:18.640 --> 48:19.620]  Oh god.
[48:21.360 --> 48:22.660]  Now who's the dog?
[48:22.960 --> 48:23.500]  I'm down!
[48:23.800 --> 48:24.260]  Dog down!
[48:25.720 --> 48:27.800]  He's going to have to resort to bullets now.
[48:28.140 --> 48:28.500]  Boo!
[48:31.120 --> 48:32.020]  Oh no!
[48:32.020 --> 48:34.740]  I can give up to get down, but I don't want to.
[48:34.800 --> 48:35.880]  I know Andrew can save me.
[48:36.480 --> 48:38.120]  Oh, that guy's just hitting you.
[48:38.720 --> 48:39.960]  Andrew, I'm just getting punched.
[48:40.140 --> 48:40.780]  Andrew, help!
[48:41.360 --> 48:43.120]  I'm pushing the dogs in!
[48:43.540 --> 48:45.360]  Alright, you got it. I'm keeping them clear.
[48:46.380 --> 48:48.140]  I got 24 seconds, Andrew.
[48:48.380 --> 48:50.820]  Yeah, it's fine. The dog's going to get there way before then.
[48:51.100 --> 48:52.560]  Okay, but you got to get me up.
[48:52.620 --> 48:53.460]  I'm going to die-die.
[48:53.680 --> 48:55.440]  Yeah, but you're going to be fine. Don't worry.
[48:55.800 --> 48:58.480]  I can feel the spirit of the dog!
[48:58.780 --> 48:59.220]  Oh no.
[48:59.220 --> 48:59.620]  It's fine.
[49:00.040 --> 49:00.540]  Got you.
[49:02.080 --> 49:03.160]  10 seconds.
[49:04.980 --> 49:05.820]  Guy right behind you.
[49:07.680 --> 49:08.920]  I'm dead.
[49:09.120 --> 49:09.740]  You didn't make it in time.
[49:11.100 --> 49:11.780]  Oh!
[49:13.140 --> 49:14.420]  The dog returns!
[49:14.500 --> 49:17.300]  Don't ever judge the dog again!
[49:19.760 --> 49:21.440]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen.
[49:22.420 --> 49:24.240]  This is a tribute.
[49:29.340 --> 49:30.460]  Oh, we're about to open that.
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.900]  Oh, we're about to open this one.
[49:31.980 --> 49:32.880]  Ah! The dog!
[49:33.840 --> 49:36.800]  You can throw your bags, I think, on the dog thing.
[49:36.880 --> 49:38.080]  And it'll just go up with it.
[49:38.340 --> 49:39.120]  Can you throw your hammer?
[49:40.600 --> 49:41.260]  It's opening.
[49:42.200 --> 49:44.540]  Throw the hammer. Hammer stays with me, bitch.
[49:47.300 --> 49:48.480]  Okay, get more loot.
[49:49.440 --> 49:50.080]  Vault opened.
[49:51.220 --> 49:51.820]  Let's go.
[49:53.700 --> 49:54.280]  Steal it all.
[49:55.040 --> 49:56.040]  Take it all, dogs.
[49:56.040 --> 49:57.420]  Take it all, dogs.
[49:57.760 --> 50:00.380]  Oh no, my game's glitched.
[50:00.400 --> 50:01.500]  Do you see this?
[50:01.840 --> 50:05.200]  Do you see my hands going non-stop?
[50:05.780 --> 50:06.380]  It won't stop.
[50:07.160 --> 50:08.600]  Do you see this?
[50:10.420 --> 50:12.120]  It won't stop.
[50:12.320 --> 50:13.900]  The dog hates you.
[50:14.340 --> 50:16.660]  The dog hates you with him.
[50:20.980 --> 50:22.300]  We're doing more?
[50:22.720 --> 50:24.000]  We can, or do you want to leave?
[50:24.000 --> 50:24.780]  It's up to us.
[50:24.840 --> 50:26.480]  Okay, let's go.
[50:27.720 --> 50:28.900]  Start the elevator.
[50:30.280 --> 50:31.820]  I got your back.
[50:31.880 --> 50:32.680]  The dog's got your back.
[50:34.640 --> 50:36.020]  Oh shit, I'm going up.
[50:36.200 --> 50:37.920]  Eric, it's separating us.
[50:38.540 --> 50:39.420]  You're gone.
[50:40.040 --> 50:41.880]  It divided the dogs.
[50:42.080 --> 50:44.460]  The dog is now the lone wolf.
[50:44.640 --> 50:46.960]  The dog has become the lone wolf.
[50:47.440 --> 50:48.440]  Oh, you've evolved.
[50:48.700 --> 50:50.420]  The dog places the drill.
[50:51.120 --> 50:52.660]  I'm going back to Andrew's perspective.
[50:53.260 --> 50:54.100]  Oh, he's coming back.
[50:54.440 --> 50:55.880]  We're uniting the dog team.
[50:57.860 --> 50:58.640]  Dog-tuggy dog!
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.060]  That guy didn't even see it coming.
[51:01.100 --> 51:01.500]  Let's go up, Eric.
[51:01.920 --> 51:02.620]  Alright, let's do it.
[51:04.520 --> 51:07.060]  Oh, we gotta catch the dog statues.
[51:07.760 --> 51:09.100]  You're just filled with bullet holes.
[51:09.600 --> 51:11.280]  Yeah, life of the dog.
[51:11.820 --> 51:12.740]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen.
[51:12.800 --> 51:13.980]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen.
[51:15.120 --> 51:16.440]  Give the pilot the signal, boys.
[51:16.460 --> 51:17.380]  Bullets can't hurt you anymore.
[51:17.860 --> 51:20.500]  Tornado, what is happening in here?
[51:20.500 --> 51:21.300]  Signaling the pilot.
[51:23.060 --> 51:24.420]  It's a chopper!
[51:25.440 --> 51:26.900]  Oh, there's people on the street, Eric.
[51:26.980 --> 51:27.520]  Go crazy.
[51:28.860 --> 51:30.260]  Go have a crazy.
[51:30.760 --> 51:32.280]  Take a fucking number.
[51:33.600 --> 51:34.780]  Now what are we doing, Andrew?
[51:34.820 --> 51:36.880]  We gotta hold tight until the second helicopter comes.
[51:37.280 --> 51:37.620]  What?
[51:38.200 --> 51:39.120]  One dog per chop.
[51:39.540 --> 51:40.860]  One dog per chop.
[51:41.680 --> 51:42.580]  Get out of here.
[51:42.740 --> 51:43.840]  Who do you think you are?
[51:44.200 --> 51:44.940]  I am.
[51:47.800 --> 51:48.620]  Dogs in the front!
[51:49.000 --> 51:49.400]  Dogs in the front!
[51:49.540 --> 51:51.080]  Dogs in the fucking back.
[51:51.160 --> 51:52.620]  Oh, you really should've...
[51:52.620 --> 51:55.280]  Why is everything dog? Are you the dog or are they the dog?
[51:55.300 --> 51:56.580]  We're all dogs here!
[51:56.580 --> 51:59.100]  Yeah, that's right. No bones about it, bitch.
[51:59.860 --> 52:00.680]  Territory dispute.
[52:02.060 --> 52:02.480]  Oh no!
[52:03.360 --> 52:05.240]  Fighting dogs, stealing dogs.
[52:06.160 --> 52:07.180]  The dog's getting shot!
[52:07.860 --> 52:08.840]  I'm a hot dog!
[52:10.480 --> 52:11.600]  It's kind of crazy.
[52:11.680 --> 52:12.980]  Dog the Bounty Hunter isn't in this.
[52:12.980 --> 52:15.360]  This feels like something he should be part of.
[52:15.620 --> 52:15.920]  Big time.
[52:16.760 --> 52:18.040]  Now who's the dog?
[52:20.160 --> 52:21.560]  Second helicopter coming in!
[52:22.020 --> 52:22.900]  Okay, let's do it, boys.
[52:24.760 --> 52:25.180]  Take it.
[52:25.260 --> 52:26.080]  Hold on to the dog.
[52:26.240 --> 52:28.000]  Signaling pilot.
[52:29.120 --> 52:29.660]  Ride out.
[52:32.340 --> 52:33.120]  Two-way radio.
[52:34.540 --> 52:35.260]  Clearing the door.
[52:35.680 --> 52:37.200]  How do I go down to the two-way radio?
[52:37.200 --> 52:39.860]  Grab some fucking loot, Eric.
[52:39.860 --> 52:43.220]  I just got 20 bags.
[52:44.640 --> 52:45.240]  Grenade!
[52:47.220 --> 52:48.280]  I'm going down.
[52:48.360 --> 52:48.840]  I'm escaping.
[52:49.560 --> 52:50.500]  I'm coming!
[52:51.280 --> 52:51.940]  Let's go!
[52:53.740 --> 52:55.900]  I can't use my secondary weapon.
[52:56.860 --> 52:58.000]  You're so slow.
[52:58.400 --> 53:00.320]  I can only use the evil pistol.
[53:00.940 --> 53:02.260]  I think you left some bags.
[53:02.700 --> 53:02.960]  No!
[53:03.820 --> 53:05.400]  I think you can only carry two at a time.
[53:06.000 --> 53:06.200]  Shit!
[53:06.200 --> 53:07.340]  I thought...
[53:09.440 --> 53:09.880]  What?
[53:10.180 --> 53:11.340]  Signaling on the other side.
[53:13.120 --> 53:13.800]  Take cover.
[53:14.380 --> 53:15.920]  I think you should take a man and a bag.
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.120]  It's a bit of extra loot.
[53:18.720 --> 53:20.940]  That drill I placed is almost done.
[53:21.520 --> 53:22.300]  Third drill.
[53:23.640 --> 53:24.720]  Planting the C4.
[53:25.220 --> 53:28.540]  Oh, Eric just got splatted up that wall.
[53:29.920 --> 53:31.080]  Eric, look at the wall to your right.
[53:31.300 --> 53:32.380]  I'm throwing the bags down.
[53:32.440 --> 53:34.060]  I'm going to go get the other bags we left.
[53:34.780 --> 53:35.520]  You got it.
[53:35.520 --> 53:36.680]  Throwing bags.
[53:36.860 --> 53:38.140]  Move to the tunnels.
[53:38.700 --> 53:40.000]  Start moving.
[53:40.800 --> 53:42.380]  Tunnels. Action.
[53:43.100 --> 53:44.100]  Tunnels. Go.
[53:46.680 --> 53:47.580]  Go, dog.
[53:47.700 --> 53:47.940]  Go.
[53:49.520 --> 53:50.940]  Every dog has his day.
[53:50.940 --> 53:52.180]  Imagine if we hadn't fallen to our deaths.
[53:52.900 --> 53:55.040]  We would have gone through all this together.
[53:55.480 --> 53:56.220]  Oh, shit.
[53:58.480 --> 53:59.580]  Power dog.
[53:59.880 --> 54:00.440]  Activate.
[54:00.740 --> 54:01.940]  Any loot in the boat.
[54:02.540 --> 54:04.280]  Do I just throw it?
[54:04.480 --> 54:07.060]  Just load the loot and then maybe come back and grab some more of the loot.
[54:07.140 --> 54:07.760]  You got it.
[54:08.140 --> 54:09.520]  Coming back with the hammer.
[54:09.680 --> 54:10.480]  Dog, activate.
[54:11.640 --> 54:12.800]  There's more guys.
[54:13.860 --> 54:15.260]  There's guys down here.
[54:15.460 --> 54:16.420]  I took a wrong turn.
[54:17.640 --> 54:18.820]  Oh my god.
[54:19.220 --> 54:20.820]  Oh my god.
[54:21.740 --> 54:22.200]  Hammer dog.
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.500]  You got him?
[54:24.600 --> 54:25.800]  You just killed Hunk.
[54:27.220 --> 54:28.400]  I'll grab these bags.
[54:28.400 --> 54:30.680]  Bag. Grabbed.
[54:30.860 --> 54:33.040]  Bag. Grabbed.
[54:33.180 --> 54:34.860]  I can only get two bags.
[54:35.220 --> 54:36.220]  Yeah, I'll get the other one.
[54:36.880 --> 54:37.560]  He's pulling the drill.
[54:38.200 --> 54:39.700]  That guy had the G-virus sample.
[54:40.580 --> 54:42.080]  Oh my god, there's guys.
[54:42.420 --> 54:43.760]  And I have to use a gun?
[54:44.440 --> 54:45.600]  Andrew, I need your help.
[54:46.700 --> 54:47.480]  I'm looting up.
[54:47.980 --> 54:49.700]  This is not how the dog operates, Andrew.
[54:50.100 --> 54:50.940]  I'm on my way.
[54:52.160 --> 54:53.480]  The dog with bullets?
[54:53.680 --> 54:54.420]  Oh no.
[54:54.420 --> 54:57.140]  Shot in the back.
[54:57.500 --> 54:58.300]  I'm on my way.
[54:58.420 --> 54:58.680]  I'm coming.
[54:58.880 --> 55:00.620]  Put down like a dog.
[55:02.700 --> 55:03.960]  The dirty dogs.
[55:04.560 --> 55:05.760]  38 seconds, Andrew.
[55:05.880 --> 55:06.520]  I'm coming.
[55:07.400 --> 55:08.640]  I'm running at full speed.
[55:10.920 --> 55:12.040]  I'm worried.
[55:13.180 --> 55:14.420]  30 seconds, Andrew.
[55:14.960 --> 55:15.780]  I'm working on him.
[55:15.840 --> 55:16.420]  There's a lot.
[55:16.560 --> 55:17.340]  I'm going to need a moment.
[55:19.600 --> 55:20.420]  That's it.
[55:21.500 --> 55:23.300]  All dogs go to heaven
[55:23.300 --> 55:25.300]  and these dogs just went to hell.
[55:25.880 --> 55:27.520]  Dragon dogs failed.
[55:27.900 --> 55:29.200]  I like it's the same result
[55:29.200 --> 55:30.980]  as if you'd also jumped off the roof.
[55:31.340 --> 55:31.900]  Yeah.
[55:32.620 --> 55:34.920]  We all did the same thing in the end.
[55:35.120 --> 55:37.300]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen.
[55:37.780 --> 55:39.500]  What an incredible game.
[55:41.220 --> 55:42.180]  He's dead.
[55:42.380 --> 55:43.180]  We're dead.
[55:43.500 --> 55:44.980]  We all die in the end.
[55:46.020 --> 55:47.120]  What are we doing?
[55:48.000 --> 55:48.760]  We got
[55:48.760 --> 55:50.140]  5 minutes.
[55:51.100 --> 55:52.540]  There's a baby job.
[55:52.720 --> 55:53.420]  Baby job?
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.980]  Oh my god.
[55:57.320 --> 55:57.820]  Dog style?
[55:59.480 --> 56:00.720]  Melee weapon run.
[56:00.840 --> 56:03.260]  If we hammered and shoveled
[56:03.260 --> 56:05.000]  every man and made a big man pile
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  with bags, how big would the pile be?
[56:07.380 --> 56:08.180]  Let's find out.
[56:09.660 --> 56:10.500]  Here we go.
[56:11.180 --> 56:13.220]  We're going to the mall and we've got to steal everything
[56:13.220 --> 56:13.780]  at the mall.
[56:13.780 --> 56:16.140]  This is so Geoff-coded.
[56:16.280 --> 56:16.980]  What are we doing?
[56:18.480 --> 56:19.220]  I got it.
[56:19.740 --> 56:20.260]  Sorry.
[56:23.170 --> 56:24.470]  The final mission.
[56:25.630 --> 56:26.970]  The final dog.
[56:27.590 --> 56:28.670]  The final dog.
[56:29.270 --> 56:31.110]  I don't know if there's going to be any dogs on this level.
[56:31.930 --> 56:33.210]  Oh, I can
[56:33.210 --> 56:34.930]  tell you there's going to be at least one.
[56:35.590 --> 56:36.050]  Okay.
[56:37.850 --> 56:39.190]  Oh, there's going to be
[56:39.910 --> 56:40.850]  a dog.
[56:42.030 --> 56:43.190]  A shippy again.
[56:43.190 --> 56:45.130]  A third round of five gifted subs.
[56:45.370 --> 56:46.410]  Thank you so much.
[56:46.750 --> 56:47.870]  Thanks a bunch.
[56:53.470 --> 56:54.530]  Weapons away.
[56:57.910 --> 56:58.910]  How'd you do that?
[56:59.590 --> 57:00.510]  I'm placing the saw
[57:00.510 --> 57:01.870]  in Saw's place.
[57:02.690 --> 57:04.230]  Guys, the saw is placed.
[57:05.130 --> 57:05.890]  Two times.
[57:06.070 --> 57:07.570]  Saw, activate.
[57:08.450 --> 57:09.350]  Who are you?
[57:11.970 --> 57:12.850]  What's happening?
[57:12.850 --> 57:14.810]  The dog has his
[57:14.810 --> 57:15.410]  day.
[57:21.450 --> 57:23.010]  Police attacking the dog.
[57:24.830 --> 57:26.790]  I'm going to be waiting for them to get out of the car
[57:26.790 --> 57:27.570]  into my shovel.
[57:30.730 --> 57:32.190]  Yeah, put him down.
[57:32.710 --> 57:33.730]  Dog style.
[57:34.390 --> 57:35.550]  Oh my god.
[57:37.050 --> 57:38.770]  I was trying to bag him,
[57:38.830 --> 57:40.310]  but you can't bag him.
[57:40.310 --> 57:41.190]  You can't?
[57:42.090 --> 57:44.550]  Oh, police. Police are coming in.
[57:45.270 --> 57:45.510]  Dog him.
[57:46.450 --> 57:47.710]  Dog him big style.
[57:48.030 --> 57:49.130]  Show me who the big dog is.
[57:51.290 --> 57:56.330]  Nick, you better get Archie playing this game.
[57:56.870 --> 57:58.950]  I don't know if I can trust you.
[58:01.230 --> 58:01.390]  Oh.
[58:03.710 --> 58:05.390]  Finished. Take the saw.
[58:06.590 --> 58:07.110]  Activate.
[58:08.990 --> 58:09.410]  Drill.
[58:09.590 --> 58:11.510]  Okay, I'm picking a box.
[58:12.050 --> 58:12.730]  Drill is placed.
[58:12.830 --> 58:13.810]  Holding for speed.
[58:14.990 --> 58:15.670]  I'm getting popped.
[58:15.870 --> 58:16.690]  Shut the door of the van.
[58:17.610 --> 58:18.450]  Taking money.
[58:20.150 --> 58:21.010]  Activate. Dogs.
[58:21.410 --> 58:24.350]  Is there like a cash register we can rob from in here or something?
[58:24.650 --> 58:25.690]  Boom, boom, boom.
[58:26.330 --> 58:27.190]  Now who has the shotgun?
[58:27.870 --> 58:29.350]  Oh, you can steal from the registers.
[58:30.770 --> 58:32.830]  Oh, cool. I'm going to this other register.
[58:33.890 --> 58:34.530]  Go get it.
[58:35.210 --> 58:36.570]  Go get it, boy.
[58:38.810 --> 58:39.830]  Oh, ATM.
[58:40.510 --> 58:41.070]  Sickle.
[58:42.070 --> 58:43.490]  Oh, the police are retreating.
[58:43.830 --> 58:45.570]  They don't want to deal with this dog action.
[58:46.630 --> 58:48.030]  The dogs are too strong.
[58:48.290 --> 58:49.530]  Retreat, you police.
[58:51.530 --> 58:52.150]  I'm going to get you, Nick.
[58:52.930 --> 58:53.810]  This is what you get.
[58:54.210 --> 58:55.030]  Dog style.
[58:55.570 --> 58:57.670]  This is horrific.
[58:58.370 --> 58:58.950]  Who's down?
[58:59.570 --> 59:00.030]  I got him.
[59:01.650 --> 59:02.090]  Nick.
[59:02.370 --> 59:03.290]  Police attacking.
[59:04.570 --> 59:06.030]  Oh, they came back.
[59:06.370 --> 59:07.590]  Almost. We're two times.
[59:08.050 --> 59:09.410]  Andrew, activate it again.
[59:09.830 --> 59:11.990]  And then you have to help us take out the police.
[59:12.310 --> 59:13.950]  I'm going across the street to get that guy.
[59:14.070 --> 59:15.530]  They're coming across the street.
[59:17.370 --> 59:18.750]  I think this is where we leave.
[59:19.470 --> 59:21.190]  Can we thump them as they get out of this chopper?
[59:21.910 --> 59:22.350]  Probably.
[59:22.590 --> 59:23.210]  Let's see.
[59:23.650 --> 59:25.090]  I'm waiting for the thumping position.
[59:25.810 --> 59:26.470]  They're coming down.
[59:26.470 --> 59:28.490]  Get ready to thump them.
[59:31.990 --> 59:33.210]  Stealing the loot.
[59:34.450 --> 59:35.250]  Loot thief.
[59:35.630 --> 59:37.090]  Guys, there's more loot.
[59:38.070 --> 59:40.590]  Somebody else steal that loot.
[59:40.850 --> 59:41.370]  Stealing it.
[59:42.990 --> 59:44.330]  Move the loot to the van.
[59:44.510 --> 59:45.650]  We got even more loot.
[59:46.850 --> 59:47.570]  Throwing a bag.
[59:48.410 --> 59:49.330]  Someone take the bag.
[59:51.150 --> 59:52.430]  Bag is thrown in.
[59:53.070 --> 59:54.570]  I got it. I'll get the bag.
[59:54.570 --> 59:55.770]  Bag, activate.
[59:56.230 --> 59:57.590]  I'm like a hound dog.
[59:57.770 --> 01:00:00.430]  Go, go, go.
[01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:03.030]  Holy shit.
[01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:04.530]  Two bags in the van.
[01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:05.710]  Is that it?
[01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.770]  Can we do it?
[01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:09.430]  Three seconds.
[01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.810]  Dogs.
[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:12.710]  Dogs run.
[01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:14.930]  Five o'clock.
[01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.090]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:18.570]  That's how the dogs do it.
[01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:22.470]  The dogs came in and robbed a gas station.
[01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:23.890]  Without firing a bullet.
[01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:25.750]  Who needs a bullet?
[01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.390]  You got the dogs.
[01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:29.050]  Like a dog with a bone.
[01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:30.970]  Look at that.
[01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:36.590]  We got $58,000.
[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:38.090]  Wow.
[01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.130]  And I'm level five.
[01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.830]  Can you guys even believe that I'm level five?
[01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:42.150]  That's unbelievable.
[01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:43.830]  Here's what's more unbelievable.
[01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:45.570]  I just got up to level six.
[01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:48.890]  There's no higher number than six.
[01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:49.910]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:51.750]  Eric only got five kills.
[01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:53.770]  I was the dog.
[01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.250]  I'm unlocking a gun.
[01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.990]  Now it's available in the store.
[01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:01.910]  Oh, guess what?
[01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:04.470]  501, baby!
[01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:06.370]  501!
[01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.750]  The best time of the week!
[01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:09.410]  Rest in peace, Michael Madsen!
[01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:11.650]  Michael Madsen, rest in peace!
[01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.910]  It's been a long time.
[01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:22.790]  And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.
[01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:23.730]  Oh no!
[01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:26.890]  Michael Madsen, rest in peace.
[01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.710]  501, the dog streak continues.
[01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.370]  These dogs are after a bone
[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:33.750]  and they won't let go.
[01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:35.810]  Michael Madsen, you've done it
[01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:36.990]  and we did it with you.
[01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:38.450]  Hell yeah.
[01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.270]  This has been Rockaway Beach or whatever the fuck this game is called.

[01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:52.790]  The way that it's meant to be found.
[01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.710]  You maniacs.
[01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.570]  What an absolutely unhinged week at Regulation.
[01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:59.450]  It has been so much.
[01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:01.150]  It's been so much.
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:03.350]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
[01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.690]  Many men were dogged.
[01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:04.890]  Many men were bagged.
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:07.210]  And many men got up to get down.
[01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.590]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:12.030]  Many men.
[01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:13.270]  That's what we should have played this whole time.
[01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.330]  That's the theme of the dog.
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.090]  Guys, we did it.
[01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:17.550]  The weekend is here.
[01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.390]  Celebrate July 4th or don't.
[01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:20.530]  I really don't care.
[01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.250]  But this has been an incredible week.
[01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.690]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.690]  And we'll see you next time on Regulation Podcast.
[01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:27.670]  Bye!
[01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:29.570]  Bag em!
