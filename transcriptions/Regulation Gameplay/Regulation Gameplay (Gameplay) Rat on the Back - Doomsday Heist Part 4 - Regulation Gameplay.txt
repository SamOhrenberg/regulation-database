[00:00.800 --> 00:02.760]  We're back in another GTA
[00:04.920 --> 00:09.100]  Do you want to start that we can do a take two? Yeah, I want to like clear your throat
[00:09.100 --> 00:14.580]  We're back. I have I'm dealing with like a throat chest infection thing. We can't again
[00:14.580 --> 00:19.460]  We can't do this again. It's been a year. It has been a while. I did recover and now it's back
[00:19.460 --> 00:26.520]  Look, we are. He breaks the chair, six months pause, he gets a chest infection, six months pause, breaks the chair again.
[00:27.100 --> 00:30.200]  Oh man, and oh and in between there goes an ankle
[00:31.600 --> 00:37.700]  Haven't been any ankles recently, but yeah. Not yet. Not yet. Oh, sorry sir. I was just seeing what was in this car
[00:38.540 --> 00:40.940]  Let me head back to...
[00:41.420 --> 00:46.380]  The thing so I can start our next prep mission. I want to do some I want to do some
[00:46.380 --> 00:50.360]  Why do I have two stars? What did you do? I stole that car that you watched me steal
[00:51.580 --> 00:54.560]  I stole the car that you watched me steal
[00:54.560 --> 00:58.560]  Use your eyes fool. I did watch them. We're gonna get away from the cops
[01:00.680 --> 01:07.440]  We're gonna wheelie down this thing. Pull back, hold back. Maybe try and get some air and do a backflip. Okay, sounds good
[01:08.560 --> 01:14.240]  Because I think if a cop sees a good backflip, they just back off. Yeah, that is. Oh, that's just a rock. Oh
[01:14.920 --> 01:15.640]  Now what?
[01:17.300 --> 01:19.940]  Whoa, baby, that's the fuck up. How did you die?
[01:21.140 --> 01:24.440]  I think my head careened into the bottom of the ocean. Oh, no
[01:25.700 --> 01:32.820]  God, yeah, what are we doing Andrew? I'm heading to the thing to... Oh, a vehicle in our organization is closed
[01:33.280 --> 01:38.160]  Oh, really? Oh, let's go get it. It's up here. How do I put in an insurance claim in this game?
[01:38.180 --> 01:40.800]  I've never done that. You gotta call Morris Mutual
[01:42.560 --> 01:43.900]  How have you never done that?
[01:44.360 --> 01:45.980]  You just blow up your car and then it's gone forever?
[01:47.080 --> 01:51.580]  Yeah, yes. And then do you see all these other cars that you run by? I just grab one of those
[01:52.280 --> 01:56.360]  Yeah, yeah, but they're you know, they're destructible and I suppose yours are too, but whatever
[01:57.580 --> 02:00.560]  I don't I don't care about any of the vehicles in this game
[02:00.560 --> 02:06.580]  I the only cars that I really get are the ones where that like you go on whatever like the car website is and they
[02:06.580 --> 02:11.100]  Say free and then I just get as many of those as I can. You don't want a flying deluxe, huh?
[02:11.580 --> 02:15.420]  I do. I don't know that I've ever had the opportunity to get one. They're very
[02:16.480 --> 02:19.620]  See, there you go. Yeah, you have 4.5 mil
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.680]  No, no, I almost have 4.5 mil. Oh, well you can almost buy one then. Cool
[02:26.680 --> 02:29.940]  Okay, I'm calling I'm calling Morris Mutual, but I'm also getting shot
[02:32.620 --> 02:38.860]  Claim all no charge Wow, cool. Yeah, if you don't blow up your cars, you don't have to pay for it. Wow
[02:39.400 --> 02:43.840]  That's cool. So I assume Gavin or I were probably responsible for the majority of those
[02:43.840 --> 02:47.280]  I did a backflip it off a rock into the ocean and
[02:47.720 --> 02:53.240]  That was enough for them to go that's fine. That was grab you can have it back. Whoa, Gavin. Whoa Gavin
[02:53.240 --> 02:56.420]  Where'd you get that? It's my phantom wedge. Oh
[02:56.860 --> 03:01.140]  Get it. I want this. This is what I want. I'm trying to get in. Oh
[03:02.300 --> 03:04.440]  How do I get on the back this way
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.600]  Quite the nose on the front. So a lot of the other cars are gonna go they're gonna go a little bit higher
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.500]  Where are you guys this rocks? We're off of a PCH
[03:22.300 --> 03:25.000]  Heading east excellent. It's out in the prep

[03:32.060 --> 03:35.820]  Can we use Gavin's vehicle? Is this something we can use for it?
[03:35.980 --> 03:39.100]  Why not or a cause I think we can use it right now. Yeah, it's cool
[03:39.100 --> 03:42.780]  Go ahead. It wants to it wants to get on this car. Oh, we find the truck here
[03:42.780 --> 03:48.180]  There you go, we separate off because I think you just get that multiple trucks, okay, I'm already separated
[03:48.180 --> 03:52.860]  All right, man, me and Gavin are going to search the first truck. I'm going
[03:53.840 --> 03:54.280]  to

[07:54.570 --> 07:59.490]  Whining about how far it was I spent my whole weekend grinding in this game

[08:12.550 --> 08:18.410]  And I mean it out the cash we move just throw a bunch of money on it before the next online comes out
[08:18.410 --> 08:24.210]  Definitely this year. Why is that grass coming out the back of this strong bird? Oh

[08:55.390 --> 08:57.790]  Didn't get to look at it very much. I dropped off a truck and left
[08:57.790 --> 09:02.570]  I will say that I am having to drive by these windmills and I do not like it. Oh
[09:02.570 --> 09:03.250]  my favorite
[09:09.790 --> 09:10.190]  No

[09:16.430 --> 09:19.330]  Think you know what you're trying to say a spirit
[09:23.930 --> 09:24.730]  Kindred spirit
[09:25.830 --> 09:32.850]  Roger Moore, it's like when a spirit when a spirit goes me mode it becomes a spirit and I think that's right
[09:34.650 --> 09:38.970]  Gavin sent me a video of him petting his cat and the cat was so mean to him
[09:38.970 --> 09:42.170]  Yeah, I was giving him some nice gentle rubs and he was just biting me
[09:44.670 --> 09:51.490]  Picture of just these claw marks all over his hand and it's like how do you live with this thing?
[09:51.830 --> 09:53.490]  Yeah, and that's just like playful bite
[09:54.730 --> 10:01.130]  If I stop doing that, I'll come up and headbutt me for more and and that's maybe I would say 5% of his true power
[10:01.130 --> 10:02.910]  dude, it was like
[10:02.910 --> 10:09.490]  Those were some big scratches on your hand. Yeah, I can't I think that's just your cat dominating

[10:14.090 --> 10:15.590]  In your closet again
[10:18.210 --> 10:21.930]  Yeah, if if Meg's not home I run the show yeah
[10:22.610 --> 10:27.710]  I was thinking about the last time we were doing these high scaven. I've been meaning to ask. How are your oxygen levels?

[10:56.890 --> 11:00.710]  Yeah, I'm worried that they think I'm killing people or something in here
[11:02.350 --> 11:06.230]  All right, I got over that fear a long time ago when Meg would just be playing
[11:06.830 --> 11:09.930]  Oh middle of the pandemic would be playing like dead by day
[11:11.530 --> 11:11.930]  Like

[16:59.050 --> 17:01.830]  Is this another prep or the thing another prep?
[17:05.190 --> 17:11.850]  You fellas need a ride? Sure. Sure. We gotta get a polito bay
[17:14.630 --> 17:17.090]  Isn't that where the original facility was? Yep
[17:19.410 --> 17:21.850]  That's fucked. Fucked up the game did that
[17:23.810 --> 17:28.950]  Oh, I guess I'm just daggling off the side sweet. To Polito Bay. Oh, that's weird
[17:28.970 --> 17:31.370]  Why didn't you get in the front seat? How strange? I guess it's a
[17:31.870 --> 17:33.170]  8-seer? 6-seer?
[17:35.570 --> 17:37.050]  How many? 6?
[17:43.380 --> 17:48.880]  I think I can call Lester right now. To do what? Just tell him I miss him
[17:50.340 --> 17:54.340]  I know you're whispering in my ear right now, but I just thought I'd call you and tell you I love you
[17:54.340 --> 17:57.520]  I mean if you don't want to do it with Lester, you could you could call Geoff and tell him
[17:59.480 --> 18:02.300]  I can locate planes and stuff for $0
[18:04.320 --> 18:06.600]  Interesting. I'm just watching a rat and a snowman
[18:08.300 --> 18:10.820]  Cancel the doomsday heist. I don't want to do that
[18:14.640 --> 18:19.020]  I'm gonna go off the radar for one minute. You guys don't know where I am. Ha ha ha
[18:19.820 --> 18:22.480]  You can we can see if we hold Y. What?
[18:23.120 --> 18:23.520]  Huh?
[18:23.520 --> 18:24.460]  Huh?
[18:26.420 --> 18:32.980]  Thank God I was ignoring you. I'm the first person just telling everybody here. You can't see me on the map
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.380]  I'm off the radar for 38 more seconds. Great
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.440]  Nick could you land the plane so I get some time?
[18:44.200 --> 18:44.900]  It's a helicopter
[18:45.600 --> 18:50.400]  Can you land the helicopter so I get some time? I think you need to go to flight school
[18:51.660 --> 18:57.860]  Yeah, yeah, tell him Nick. I got gold medals in it. What really? Yeah, nice
[18:58.700 --> 19:00.660]  It is surprisingly annoying
[19:02.060 --> 19:05.380]  Can I teach you is that what you said? Yeah, absolutely
[19:07.180 --> 19:09.000]  Not qualified to do that. I just
[19:09.660 --> 19:15.400]  Aced the quiz. It's a snowman a rat in the boot. Off the radar for one more second. Beautiful
[19:19.380 --> 19:19.700]  I
[19:22.180 --> 19:25.580]  Think it's a big piece of cheese. What are we doing over here? Oh, is that a ship?
[19:26.440 --> 19:30.480]  Oh, let's do we have to jump out and get jets. Oh, we're getting jet skis. Why don't we just go to the ship?
[19:31.260 --> 19:33.520]  Look, I'll just take the chopper there, but okay
[19:35.140 --> 19:36.780]  I'm a jet ski rat, baby
[19:38.740 --> 19:41.820]  That's the best landing I've ever done in one of these that is great
[19:43.880 --> 19:45.220]  Oh, I'm not gonna make it
[19:48.500 --> 19:58.000]  Wait, are you? Gavin, here I come. We're on our way. Pick me up. I need help. How do I fire the gun?
[20:05.660 --> 20:11.120]  What'd you do? Oh shit, I'm in the middle of all of them. Oh shit
[20:11.820 --> 20:21.900]  I died. Wait, I killed Eric? How did I do that? Nick ran me over. What? I didn't fly in a freaking helicopter. What did I? What happened?
[20:23.240 --> 20:26.340]  I think the game's trying to screw us. Holy shit, I hit him.
[20:32.080 --> 20:35.140]  Halo mode. Open fire!
[20:35.790 --> 20:37.260]  Is that it? It's gonna...
[20:37.260 --> 20:41.440]  What is going on?
[20:41.580 --> 20:43.220]  I'm coming in hot!
[20:44.700 --> 20:47.240]  Stop! Stop! Stop coming in hot!
[20:48.720 --> 20:49.780]  I can't stop!
[20:55.820 --> 20:59.470]  Oh shit, where are we supposed to go?
[20:59.470 --> 21:03.430]  Oh, Nick!
[21:09.750 --> 21:10.870]  What happened?
[21:12.970 --> 21:18.210]  Okay, well, we failed. I gotta go all the way back.
[21:18.890 --> 21:24.010]  I didn't know you could even fail this. You blew them all up with your helicopter.
[21:24.290 --> 21:28.390]  What were we supposed to do here? Grab the things and then leave.
[21:28.390 --> 21:29.990]  Don't read shit.
[21:30.110 --> 21:32.910]  He was just like, I'm in a helicopter, this is great.
[21:34.030 --> 21:37.230]  At least the facility is right next to this.
[21:37.790 --> 21:38.950]  Oh my god.
[21:39.990 --> 21:43.810]  Hey, hey, I'm really... I'm sorry.
[21:44.710 --> 21:48.370]  Apology not accepted. Well, I didn't read, so you can't really blame me.
[21:49.570 --> 21:52.710]  Is that how that works? Yeah.
[21:54.670 --> 21:56.910]  I was flying. It's like Double Jeopardy.
[21:58.490 --> 22:02.370]  I didn't read. I wish I could have told my dad that in high school.
[22:04.270 --> 22:07.490]  I didn't read, so you really can't blame me.
[22:07.770 --> 22:09.790]  You think I was out here reading, idiot? Yeah.
[22:10.470 --> 22:12.110]  I play sports, but not really.
[22:12.670 --> 22:15.410]  If you can't read, this report card might be great.
[22:16.970 --> 22:18.270]  I'm running to the monitor.
[22:23.510 --> 22:26.370]  Me and Nick are doing bumfights on the beach.
[22:28.370 --> 22:29.410]  Mine's in the snow.
[22:30.770 --> 22:31.170]  Wait.
[22:34.510 --> 22:35.550]  Did it move?
[22:35.890 --> 22:37.510]  It moved to the other side.
[22:38.290 --> 22:38.610]  No!
[22:40.290 --> 22:42.630]  Eric to the road.
[22:42.730 --> 22:45.110]  We always think we're smarter than the game, and then the game goes, you're an idiot.
[22:45.210 --> 22:47.110]  I told you exactly what was gonna fucking happen.
[22:47.330 --> 22:48.110]  We all knew. You called it.
[22:48.510 --> 22:51.570]  We all knew. Dumbass game.
[22:54.130 --> 22:55.610]  Did he say duty free shopping?
[22:56.910 --> 22:58.870]  Can Nick not have a helicopter this time?
[23:00.210 --> 23:00.530]  Sure.
[23:01.370 --> 23:04.210]  I mean, he can, but will he?
[23:04.330 --> 23:08.050]  You would blend in that platform for what felt like two straight minutes somehow.
[23:09.350 --> 23:11.570]  We were trying to figure out what to do.
[23:12.250 --> 23:15.490]  Nick got run over by a truck.
[23:17.190 --> 23:18.450]  Get out, you prick.
[23:18.650 --> 23:19.830]  That was crazy.
[23:19.890 --> 23:20.410]  Get in, Eric.
[23:20.670 --> 23:21.090]  Let's go.
[23:22.370 --> 23:23.690]  Alright, take us south, bud.
[23:24.090 --> 23:26.150]  That guy hit me with a car and said, why don't you blow me?
[23:26.150 --> 23:27.690]  Like, dude, you hit me.
[23:28.410 --> 23:30.290]  Wait, you guys are in a helicopter?
[23:30.950 --> 23:31.670]  Yeah, dude.
[23:32.290 --> 23:34.430]  Should we meet above the platform and dive out?
[23:36.290 --> 23:37.810]  No, I'm taking a jet ski.
[23:38.430 --> 23:40.110]  You guys are crazy.
[23:40.390 --> 23:41.350]  Oh, Andrew's out.
[23:42.090 --> 23:43.210]  I dove out.
[23:44.730 --> 23:45.550]  That's what you said.
[23:46.050 --> 23:47.470]  Nick, what are you doing?
[23:48.190 --> 23:48.670]  Shortcut!
[23:52.730 --> 23:57.050]  A truck carrying a trailer just flying in the air.
[23:57.190 --> 23:58.630]  Well, the trailer's gone now.
[23:59.330 --> 24:00.250]  That really hurt.
[24:00.830 --> 24:01.510]  How's it looking, Andrew?
[24:02.810 --> 24:04.290]  Gavin crashed into me.
[24:05.730 --> 24:07.390]  Are you eating something?
[24:10.590 --> 24:12.750]  What a crazy time to be eating.
[24:13.810 --> 24:14.870]  Alright, let's go, Eric.
[24:14.990 --> 24:16.010]  I'm coating my throat.
[24:16.710 --> 24:18.390]  Oh, you got lozenge?
[24:18.530 --> 24:19.490]  Oh, you got lozenge?
[24:19.570 --> 24:20.830]  Hey, it's Gavin, let's go!
[24:21.770 --> 24:24.090]  Oh, you know it.
[24:24.710 --> 24:26.010]  I'm riding in style.
[24:26.110 --> 24:26.710]  Yeah, let's do it.
[24:26.830 --> 24:27.810]  Oh my god.
[24:30.230 --> 24:31.250]  Are we dropping?
[24:31.250 --> 24:33.330]  They just shoot you a lot whenever you try to get in.
[24:34.390 --> 24:35.350]  Yeah, but first we just gotta
[24:36.130 --> 24:37.530]  shoot around this guy.
[24:37.710 --> 24:40.050]  Gavin, that's how I destroyed the last one.
[24:40.330 --> 24:42.510]  Yeah, but just shoot the jet skis.
[24:44.010 --> 24:44.930]  Oh god!
[24:45.250 --> 24:46.170]  I'm down!
[24:46.330 --> 24:46.830]  Let's go!
[24:48.510 --> 24:49.590]  Making progress.
[24:50.390 --> 24:51.810]  Killed a few of them that time.
[24:53.570 --> 24:54.710]  Whose body is this?
[24:54.750 --> 24:55.350]  Is that Andrew?
[24:56.170 --> 24:57.310]  Ow, there's a dude on a jet ski!
[25:01.910 --> 25:02.770]  Who's this?
[25:04.470 --> 25:06.210]  So, steal the torpedo
[25:06.210 --> 25:07.050]  ECUs.
[25:07.290 --> 25:10.070]  And we'll take the helicopter
[25:10.070 --> 25:11.610]  that's here when we leave.
[25:11.610 --> 25:13.110]  Alright, I got the other one.
[25:14.830 --> 25:15.470]  Let's go.
[25:16.830 --> 25:17.770]  Oh, it's real
[25:17.770 --> 25:19.010]  close to the side of this thing.
[25:20.450 --> 25:21.470]  Why can't I get in?
[25:22.230 --> 25:23.470]  I'll cover us.
[25:24.350 --> 25:25.570]  Okay, I'm in. Let's go.
[25:27.410 --> 25:28.370]  Goodbye, my friends.
[25:29.030 --> 25:31.030]  I'm getting in!
[25:32.510 --> 25:33.310]  Oh god, take off.
[25:34.650 --> 25:36.350]  Oh Jesus Christ.
[25:36.750 --> 25:37.370]  We're alright!
[25:38.110 --> 25:38.910]  Open fire!
[25:38.910 --> 25:39.950]  Oh shit!
[25:40.370 --> 25:41.290]  Take that down!
[25:43.930 --> 25:45.150]  This thing's beat up already.
[25:47.210 --> 25:49.310]  And that thing is in my blind spot.
[25:52.770 --> 25:58.250]  Hey, this is a snowstorm for me.
[25:59.570 --> 26:00.550]  It's going below.
[26:00.710 --> 26:01.630]  The helicopter's going below.
[26:02.750 --> 26:04.730]  I'm gonna just get a little bit of extra height
[26:04.730 --> 26:06.890]  because when the chopper conks out, we need to all jump out
[26:06.890 --> 26:08.590]  before it blows up our heist press.
[26:08.670 --> 26:09.590]  I think theirs is going down.
[26:10.710 --> 26:11.530]  It's on fire.
[26:12.970 --> 26:13.710]  Come on.
[26:15.330 --> 26:17.070]  It's just like below us.
[26:19.710 --> 26:20.590]  Oh, there it is.
[26:20.650 --> 26:21.290]  It's way back there.
[26:23.570 --> 26:24.510]  Down he goes.
[26:24.910 --> 26:25.450]  Come on.
[26:36.500 --> 26:38.280]  Can I have a sniper rifle
[26:38.280 --> 26:38.700]  from here?
[26:44.010 --> 26:44.910]  Ooh, flare gun.
[26:46.390 --> 26:47.450]  I think I'm getting hit by the...
[26:47.450 --> 26:47.850]  Uh-oh.
[26:50.330 --> 26:51.370]  Adios, fellas!
[26:53.110 --> 26:53.670]  Ow.
[26:56.890 --> 26:58.410]  I'm getting shot by a helicopter.
[27:05.120 --> 27:06.120]  I'll get a car.
[27:08.260 --> 27:09.100]  Free fall!
[27:13.920 --> 27:14.800]  Stop driving.
[27:15.400 --> 27:16.360]  I got a minivan, fellas.
[27:17.440 --> 27:18.740]  I'm going over the mountain.
[27:18.740 --> 27:20.660]  I'm trying to do the same thing.
[27:21.800 --> 27:22.900]  Yeah, I'm just gonna land
[27:22.900 --> 27:23.440]  at the facility.
[27:25.720 --> 27:26.200]  Wait.
[27:27.120 --> 27:28.760]  I'm doing my best to also land
[27:28.760 --> 27:30.720]  at the facility. Also, the helicopter is still
[27:30.720 --> 27:32.860]  shooting at me. I'll take care of that.
[27:33.260 --> 27:34.900]  Okay. Let me get my
[27:34.900 --> 27:36.220]  momobile over there.
[27:36.480 --> 27:38.320]  Oh, it's hitting me. Uh-oh.
[27:38.680 --> 27:39.600]  It's hitting me.
[27:40.960 --> 27:42.280]  Why did I run over a pig?
[27:42.880 --> 27:43.880]  I don't know.
[27:47.480 --> 27:48.400]  So when you said you were gonna
[27:48.400 --> 27:50.100]  take care of the helicopter, what does that mean?
[27:50.100 --> 27:52.000]  Well, I'm in a minivan, man. I gotta catch up.
[27:52.320 --> 27:54.340]  It means I'm gonna, you know, watch it from afar.
[27:54.880 --> 27:56.220]  Yeah, wait. So you were trying to get
[27:56.220 --> 27:57.640]  a minivan, thinking...
[27:58.200 --> 27:59.640]  I would pick you guys up.
[28:01.780 --> 28:02.140]  Yeah.
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.560]  It's coming for you, Eric.
[28:07.640 --> 28:08.000]  Yeah.
[28:08.120 --> 28:09.940]  Hold on, Eric. Here I come.
[28:13.750 --> 28:15.510]  Got it. Nice. We're clear.
[28:15.730 --> 28:17.590]  I just bailed out of the minivan. Oh, wow.
[28:17.650 --> 28:19.210]  Thanks, Nick. Thanks for the help.
[28:20.490 --> 28:20.990]  Hey, you know what?
[28:21.650 --> 28:22.110]  You're welcome.
[28:26.030 --> 28:27.310]  This fucking guy.
[28:29.790 --> 28:31.770]  I'm on foot. If somebody has a vehicle
[28:31.770 --> 28:33.450]  and can come pick me up, that would rock.
[28:34.990 --> 28:35.670]  There's more
[28:35.670 --> 28:36.690]  helicopters coming.
[28:37.770 --> 28:38.370]  Get in, son.
[28:39.590 --> 28:40.390]  On my way.
[28:40.390 --> 28:40.450]  Wait.
[28:45.950 --> 28:47.670]  I can see the yellow
[28:47.670 --> 28:48.150]  ring.
[28:49.850 --> 28:50.710]  Oh, man.
[28:54.850 --> 28:55.710]  There. Nice.
[28:55.990 --> 28:57.650]  Good shooting. Thank you.
[28:58.750 --> 28:59.690]  And Andrew took my car.
[29:00.350 --> 29:01.890]  Oh, we're so close to the yellow ring.
[29:04.250 --> 29:04.790]  Halo?
[29:13.190 --> 29:13.890]  Oh, nice bail.
[29:13.890 --> 29:15.030]  Oh, my God, Andrew.
[29:15.570 --> 29:16.710]  I missed the ring.
[29:17.630 --> 29:19.690]  Overshot slightly. Just a little.
[29:19.690 --> 29:20.130]  Whoa.
[29:21.950 --> 29:22.810]  One, two.
[29:24.110 --> 29:25.950]  Prep complete. We did it.
[29:26.110 --> 29:26.790]  Look at us.
[29:27.550 --> 29:29.710]  Complete 14 prep missions without dying. Let's do some missions.
[29:30.230 --> 29:31.430]  Let's do it. This is it.
[29:31.550 --> 29:33.730]  I'm sorry. What? Did you just get something
[29:33.730 --> 29:35.790]  that said complete 14 prep missions without
[29:35.790 --> 29:37.190]  dying? Yeah.
[29:37.570 --> 29:38.830]  Well, I got five of 14.
[29:39.750 --> 29:41.510]  Oh. I thought you had gotten
[29:41.510 --> 29:43.450]  all 14. Like, no.
[29:43.530 --> 29:44.670]  I've only done, like, five.
[29:46.190 --> 29:47.770]  How did you not die
[29:47.770 --> 29:49.130]  during that process?
[29:50.390 --> 29:51.570]  Well, I don't think the first one counted.
[29:52.490 --> 29:53.370]  But you died.
[29:53.670 --> 29:55.430]  I died, like, ten times in that process.
[29:55.430 --> 29:56.590]  I died this time? I didn't die.
[29:57.450 --> 29:58.370]  I didn't die?
[29:59.730 --> 30:01.910]  Because I rode with Gavin to the
[30:01.910 --> 30:02.430]  thing.
[30:03.470 --> 30:05.510]  We killed the people. We flew away from the thing.
[30:06.010 --> 30:06.970]  I'm still alive now.
[30:07.350 --> 30:09.010]  Your Honor, I can't read. I didn't die.
[30:14.610 --> 30:15.650]  I didn't die.
[30:16.850 --> 30:18.870]  I lived forever good now.
[30:22.230 --> 30:23.110]  How's it looking, Andrew?
[30:23.870 --> 30:25.110]  I'm sending out invites
[30:25.750 --> 30:27.950]  once I turn this fucking radio off.
[30:28.130 --> 30:28.970]  Oh, no, Gavin!
[30:30.510 --> 30:31.710]  Oh, wait. Do you think
[30:31.710 --> 30:33.650]  that if we get on the main road and I
[30:33.650 --> 30:35.610]  drive as fast as I can and I
[30:35.610 --> 30:37.630]  hit the front, do you think I can just do, like, a front flip
[30:37.630 --> 30:38.390]  off of it? Definitely.
[30:40.490 --> 30:41.210]  Auto-invited.
[30:42.390 --> 30:43.830]  Oh, man. Well, you know, next time.
[30:44.810 --> 30:45.210]  Yeah.
[30:48.210 --> 30:49.750]  Nick's going, yeah, that's right. Me too.
[30:50.150 --> 30:51.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:51.350 --> 30:53.590]  Well, I was running down a runway for a long time.
[30:55.870 --> 30:56.270]  Okay.
[30:58.670 --> 30:59.730]  That's a lot of money.
[30:59.770 --> 31:00.910]  Gavin and I are on the same level.
[31:01.550 --> 31:02.530]  Oh, my God.
[31:03.670 --> 31:06.650]  Oh, the Avenger.
[31:10.190 --> 31:11.730]  My favorite Sean Connery.
[31:18.610 --> 31:18.930]  So
[31:18.930 --> 31:20.250]  what do we have to do? We just steal this thing?
[31:20.390 --> 31:22.690]  Or is it going to blow it up? Sean Connery
[31:22.690 --> 31:24.710]  has a bunch of people in fucking jelly
[31:25.210 --> 31:26.430]  bear suits or something.
[31:26.650 --> 31:28.530]  This could be the one where we go into the hangar and it's all
[31:28.530 --> 31:29.130]  night vish.
[31:30.850 --> 31:32.610]  Oh. Oh, your favorites.
[31:34.110 --> 31:34.750]  Mighty Morphin
[31:34.750 --> 31:35.730]  Power Rangers.
[31:36.990 --> 31:37.610]  Where's Michael Ruma?
[31:40.270 --> 31:40.710]  We're going
[31:40.710 --> 31:40.990]  to the airport.
[31:43.710 --> 31:45.290]  We're going to the airport.
[31:45.370 --> 31:46.390]  Alright, Ned, we're going to the airport.
[31:46.790 --> 31:48.910]  Oh, I like
[31:48.910 --> 31:50.210]  Gavin, is that yours? Yeah, why not?
[31:50.590 --> 31:51.990]  Oh, he's in a Formula 1 car.
[31:52.490 --> 31:53.970]  Gavin's got his little F1 car.
[31:56.170 --> 31:56.710]  See you there.
[31:56.970 --> 31:58.410]  Hang a left. Oh, my God.
[31:58.950 --> 31:59.590]  We don't need a left.
[32:00.230 --> 32:02.090]  We're going to drive through the jail?
[32:03.210 --> 32:04.130]  We need a left.
[32:04.310 --> 32:06.810]  I'm still processing that he said to a Formula
[32:06.810 --> 32:08.930]  1 car, see you there. Unironic.
[32:09.690 --> 32:11.130]  You said see you there.
[32:12.830 --> 32:13.850]  I'm saying it to Gavin.
[32:14.750 --> 32:15.630]  That's my point.
[32:17.350 --> 32:19.010]  You're implying that we'll get there
[32:19.010 --> 32:20.930]  first. Well, I'm following you guys, so you might.
[32:22.210 --> 32:23.150]  We will get there
[32:23.150 --> 32:24.710]  first. It's Gavin driving that car.
[32:25.730 --> 32:26.570]  Shots fired.
[32:29.230 --> 32:30.810]  Oh, that was nice, Nick.
[32:31.090 --> 32:31.990]  That was real cool.
[32:37.290 --> 32:37.650]  we
[32:39.510 --> 32:40.330]  might beat him.
[32:42.390 --> 32:43.010]  Alright, gotta
[32:43.010 --> 32:44.230]  get past this here
[32:45.250 --> 32:45.970]  barrier. Okay.
[32:48.710 --> 32:49.070]  Alright,
[32:49.110 --> 32:50.230]  let's see if Gavin can race.
[32:53.510 --> 32:54.230]  Oh, no.
[32:54.510 --> 32:55.850]  I've got a piece of fence stuck up it.
[32:58.130 --> 32:58.850]  That's crazy.
[32:59.010 --> 33:00.890]  But also, Andrew, if I had said
[33:00.890 --> 33:03.170]  see you there and he beat us there, we're still going to see him there.
[33:03.170 --> 33:04.030]  Yeah, that's true.
[33:16.990 --> 33:18.110]  It's the snow.
[33:19.330 --> 33:21.150]  Yeah, it's Nick getting the physics
[33:21.150 --> 33:21.730]  of the snow.
[33:22.310 --> 33:24.410]  Yeah, it's pretty slick.
[33:25.150 --> 33:26.390]  You shouldn't be driving.
[33:27.650 --> 33:29.010]  Nah, you got this.
[33:31.570 --> 33:33.090]  Yeah, dude, we totally got this.
[33:33.130 --> 33:33.590]  Look at this.
[33:37.510 --> 33:38.950]  Is Lester still talking?
[33:38.950 --> 33:40.290]  Dude, I was about to say the same thing.
[33:40.350 --> 33:41.070]  He's just, man.
[33:44.110 --> 33:46.110]  They must have made him do several takes of this
[33:46.110 --> 33:48.050]  spiel, the actor.
[33:48.230 --> 33:49.990]  I don't think anyone's ever listened to Lester.
[33:50.730 --> 33:51.090]  Yeah.
[33:55.780 --> 33:56.920]  Oh, my health just went up.
[33:57.100 --> 33:58.440]  I'm going to call him because I miss him.
[34:01.280 --> 34:03.260]  I just want you to know I listen to all your lines.
[34:04.620 --> 34:05.620]  I want more spiel.
[34:06.860 --> 34:08.640]  Tell me more about what we're doing.
[34:08.640 --> 34:10.240]  I didn't pay attention to any of that.
[34:10.280 --> 34:11.440]  Much like his spirit.
[34:12.020 --> 34:12.880]  His spirit?
[34:13.520 --> 34:15.240]  He sent me the voicemail.
[34:15.680 --> 34:16.080]  Lester.
[34:17.680 --> 34:19.560]  When he goes insane.
[34:22.560 --> 34:24.100]  Ah, he's alter-eager. Lester.
[34:24.700 --> 34:25.040]  Eager.
[34:26.200 --> 34:27.020]  Get him, Gavin.
[34:30.660 --> 34:32.680]  Oh, it's Dr. Jekyll and his alter-ego,
[34:32.840 --> 34:33.340]  Jekyll.
[34:36.000 --> 34:36.760]  Dr. Jekyll.
[34:36.760 --> 34:39.240]  He's turned Dr. and Mr. Jekyll.
[34:39.760 --> 34:41.460]  Dr. and
[34:41.460 --> 34:43.420]  Mr. Jekyll.
[34:46.280 --> 34:49.040]  Dr. Jekyll, and this is my evil
[34:49.040 --> 34:51.660]  counterpart, Mr. Jekyll.
[34:52.940 --> 34:53.460]  Ah!
[34:54.900 --> 34:55.420]  Ah!
[34:55.420 --> 34:55.920]  Ah!
[34:59.660 --> 35:01.900]  He just lost his PhD.
[35:02.360 --> 35:02.740]  Yeah.
[35:03.740 --> 35:05.540]  He was disbarred,
[35:05.640 --> 35:06.860]  so he's just Mr. now.
[35:08.380 --> 35:09.500]  Dude, that's so
[35:09.500 --> 35:09.940]  funny.
[35:12.340 --> 35:13.640]  Wait for your team.
[35:14.380 --> 35:15.300]  Hey, Gavin, see you there.
[35:15.420 --> 35:16.020]  I'll see you guys there.
[35:17.020 --> 35:19.460]  I'll be honest, I got stuck. I took a jump.
[35:19.460 --> 35:21.280]  I'm on the roof of the car park, and I can't get down.
[35:23.000 --> 35:23.980]  What's in your hand?
[35:24.860 --> 35:26.540]  A gun? No.
[35:26.780 --> 35:28.460]  Put it away. Don't.
[35:28.960 --> 35:29.540]  I saw.
[35:30.840 --> 35:31.360]  Shit.
[35:34.700 --> 35:35.500]  Gavin died.
[35:36.840 --> 35:39.000]  Do it again. Are you...
[35:39.000 --> 35:39.680]  Do it again.
[35:40.760 --> 35:42.060]  It was oxygen levels.
[35:43.800 --> 35:44.860]  Where's my parachute?
[35:45.000 --> 35:45.320]  What happened?
[35:45.320 --> 35:47.260]  How open is
[35:47.260 --> 35:47.940]  the window?
[35:49.720 --> 35:50.860]  Cracked? Or open?
[35:50.960 --> 35:51.620]  It's wide open.
[35:52.340 --> 35:55.100]  Are the cats on the desk breathing directly
[35:55.100 --> 35:55.960]  into your mouth?
[35:57.320 --> 35:59.420]  Is your fan pointed
[35:59.420 --> 36:00.200]  towards the window?
[36:02.540 --> 36:07.240]  Gavin, would you say you're more of a
[36:07.240 --> 36:08.820]  Dr. Jekyll or a Mr. Jekyll?
[36:09.120 --> 36:10.680]  I'm definitely disbarred after that.
[36:13.260 --> 36:13.700]  Just
[36:13.700 --> 36:14.860]  huff a bag of
[36:14.860 --> 36:16.160]  cat air before you leave.
[36:16.260 --> 36:16.540]  No!
[36:18.740 --> 36:19.180]  Gavin!
[36:23.460 --> 36:24.680]  Alright, Gavin.
[36:24.900 --> 36:26.760]  Oh wait, this is a one person car.
[36:26.980 --> 36:27.880]  I can't even ride with you.
[36:28.220 --> 36:29.960]  Just drive it. Don't let him do it.
[36:32.920 --> 36:34.340]  Trying to get rid of it.
[36:34.760 --> 36:36.400]  Trying to blow it up.
[36:37.700 --> 36:38.800]  We get to listen to Lester
[36:38.800 --> 36:39.100]  again.
[36:39.960 --> 36:41.300]  Oh, I love your spiel.
[36:44.900 --> 36:46.020]  Go on, Lester.
[36:49.100 --> 36:49.740]  Oh, hey.
[36:50.660 --> 36:51.360]  What's up, Miss S?
[36:53.280 --> 36:54.860]  Good. You're giving me an excuse
[36:54.860 --> 36:55.620]  to spit you out.
[36:57.600 --> 36:58.360]  Let's catch him.
[36:59.080 --> 36:59.820]  We can do it.
[37:00.500 --> 37:01.360]  Hold wide to catch me.
[37:01.360 --> 37:02.380]  Oh, shit.
[37:07.120 --> 37:09.700]  That car almost caused an accident for us.
[37:10.880 --> 37:12.120]  I'm warming up my tires.
[37:14.520 --> 37:15.500]  You can't hit me.
[37:17.640 --> 37:18.240]  Oh!
[37:19.740 --> 37:21.200]  Oh, damn it!
[37:22.060 --> 37:23.300]  Too much of being that guy.
[37:31.470 --> 37:33.130]  Why is there a fully armored car
[37:33.130 --> 37:34.710]  in an F1 vehicle going down the street?
[37:41.080 --> 37:42.800]  Did you happen to catch the light
[37:42.800 --> 37:44.140]  underneath that armored vehicle?
[37:44.340 --> 37:45.780]  That was really cool.
[37:45.940 --> 37:47.980]  I actually didn't see it.
[37:48.060 --> 37:50.460]  I saw an F1 car blowing through reds
[37:50.460 --> 37:52.100]  so I didn't get to see the under light.
[37:52.320 --> 37:53.680]  It's too bad you missed the under light
[37:53.680 --> 37:54.680]  of the car behind it.
[37:55.480 --> 37:56.660]  Yeah, that was green.
[37:56.780 --> 37:57.340]  Oh, no!
[37:57.340 --> 37:58.620]  Oh, Nick!
[38:00.460 --> 38:01.080]  We're skating!
[38:01.480 --> 38:02.780]  Let me know if you blame that on the snow.
[38:04.300 --> 38:04.700]  That was Gavin.
[38:06.400 --> 38:06.800]  What?
[38:07.300 --> 38:08.740]  Don't worry, I'll kill the snow.
[38:10.400 --> 38:11.780]  That was Gavin!
[38:12.680 --> 38:13.500]  Yeah, he spun us out
[38:13.500 --> 38:14.600]  from ahead.
[38:22.640 --> 38:24.300]  Oh, is this how you fucked it up last time?
[38:25.600 --> 38:26.380]  Oh, my God!
[38:27.120 --> 38:27.860]  That was cool.
[38:28.460 --> 38:29.840]  Oh, we landed it!
[38:29.840 --> 38:30.160]  It worked!
[38:31.640 --> 38:32.380]  Can I go over?
[38:32.840 --> 38:35.980]  Now we're on the top
[38:35.980 --> 38:37.700]  of the parking structure.
[38:38.020 --> 38:39.900]  Hey guys, if you want to get down
[38:39.900 --> 38:41.020]  don't just jump off that.
[38:42.740 --> 38:43.240]  There you go.
[38:43.900 --> 38:44.340]  Like this?
[38:47.900 --> 38:49.360]  I'll melt the snow for us.
[38:49.440 --> 38:50.200]  You just go this way.
[38:51.340 --> 38:51.720]  Okay!
[38:54.740 --> 38:55.400]  Oh, wait.
[38:55.680 --> 38:58.000]  Is this a full night vision thing
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.260]  and we have to shoot a bunch of people?
[38:59.740 --> 39:00.120]  I think so.
[39:00.340 --> 39:02.420]  I feel like I watched Funhaus play this
[39:02.420 --> 39:05.520]  for nine and a half hours just dying
[39:05.520 --> 39:06.540]  over and over and over again.
[39:06.540 --> 39:07.380]  I think I watched that too.
[39:07.440 --> 39:08.700]  They were really struggling for some reason.
[39:08.760 --> 39:11.100]  They were bad at that.
[39:13.180 --> 39:14.240]  We got this.
[39:14.980 --> 39:15.880]  We got it, fellas.
[39:16.380 --> 39:17.180]  This is it.
[39:18.080 --> 39:20.900]  One-time charmers or something.
[39:21.240 --> 39:21.500]  What?
[39:23.080 --> 39:23.520]  Don't!
[39:23.520 --> 39:24.080]  Oh, shit.
[39:27.160 --> 39:28.460]  Alright, let's do it.
[39:28.540 --> 39:30.320]  One-time charmers. Let's go, boys.
[39:30.980 --> 39:32.520]  That's going to catch on.
[39:33.180 --> 39:34.080]  That's the new rage.
[39:34.420 --> 39:35.600]  The Simpsons character?
[39:36.760 --> 39:37.060]  What?
[39:38.620 --> 39:39.620]  Oh, it's not night vision.
[39:42.720 --> 39:43.500]  Gavin's like
[39:43.500 --> 39:44.580]  doing a bit.
[39:50.060 --> 39:51.260]  Oh, Christ!
[39:53.640 --> 39:55.040]  Oh, my God.
[39:55.040 --> 39:56.180]  Take cover, fellas.
[39:56.840 --> 39:57.700]  Eat your shit and all that.
[39:59.600 --> 40:01.520]  Don't forget to eat your shit.
[40:03.280 --> 40:05.180]  Eat your shit and all that.
[40:09.340 --> 40:10.220]  That's awesome.
[40:12.560 --> 40:13.480]  Please die.
[40:16.100 --> 40:17.620]  Who's shooting me? Who's doing it?
[40:17.960 --> 40:19.300]  Who's shooting me?
[40:19.440 --> 40:20.340]  Who's doing it?
[40:20.340 --> 40:22.420]  Who's doing it?
[40:22.620 --> 40:24.500]  That's the first-time charmer for you.
[40:24.540 --> 40:25.600]  Oh, they're behind us.
[40:25.760 --> 40:27.660]  Oh, my God. They're everywhere.
[40:28.520 --> 40:28.860]  That was on me.
[40:29.960 --> 40:32.360]  That was on me. That was an unfortunate
[40:32.360 --> 40:33.700]  combination of button pushes.
[40:34.840 --> 40:35.320]  Bruce?
[40:37.340 --> 40:38.700]  I think that's what the video
[40:38.700 --> 40:40.320]  was, right? Like, every time
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.260]  they died, it was
[40:42.260 --> 40:43.780]  calling out the person.
[40:43.980 --> 40:44.520]  Oh, no.
[40:45.760 --> 40:48.200]  I actually pulled out my snowball launcher
[40:48.200 --> 40:50.540]  and then I opened my phone, trying to eat snacks
[40:50.540 --> 40:51.820]  and I got snowballed. What?
[40:52.420 --> 40:54.040]  You just blasted snowballs?
[40:54.200 --> 40:55.720]  I fired a snowball in the dark.
[40:58.440 --> 41:00.380]  Fleeing snowballs and FaceTiming your mom.
[41:04.320 --> 41:06.080]  I think I'm the one with the gun out.
[41:07.580 --> 41:08.020]  Nope.
[41:08.900 --> 41:09.640]  It's not my gun.
[41:12.850 --> 41:13.770]  It's my gun.
[41:14.570 --> 41:15.410]  Pull out your guns.
[41:15.870 --> 41:17.350]  Alright. Andrew, I'll stick with you.
[41:18.850 --> 41:19.470]  I'm also
[41:19.470 --> 41:20.430]  with you. I'll go to Gavin.
[41:20.610 --> 41:21.270]  Oh, shit.
[41:23.810 --> 41:24.610]  Let's go!
[41:27.890 --> 41:30.370]  I'm going up.
[41:31.930 --> 41:33.410]  Man, being able to put armor on
[41:33.410 --> 41:34.630]  with one button is incredible.
[41:34.850 --> 41:35.310]  Isn't that crazy?
[41:37.250 --> 41:38.730]  Where was that my whole life?
[41:39.630 --> 41:40.590]  In the game, I assume.
[41:40.890 --> 41:42.090]  No, I mean, it was there.
[41:42.430 --> 41:43.570]  You just weren't using it.
[41:47.730 --> 41:48.530]  Bye, dude.
[41:51.410 --> 41:52.170]  Oh, shit.
[41:53.110 --> 41:55.350]  Hey, Lester, we know there are enemies in front of us.
[41:55.450 --> 41:56.090]  We're killing them.
[41:58.570 --> 41:59.570]  Where are these guys?
[41:59.630 --> 42:00.270]  Are they up top?
[42:00.390 --> 42:01.570]  They're everywhere.
[42:03.550 --> 42:03.830]  Gotcha.
[42:05.150 --> 42:06.670]  Yeah, I'm up in the rafters, but
[42:07.130 --> 42:08.010]  there's quite a lot of them.
[42:08.910 --> 42:09.890]  What are you doing, Andrew?
[42:10.230 --> 42:12.530]  I'm going up the stairs to get to the generators.
[42:12.530 --> 42:13.110]  Okay.
[42:15.410 --> 42:16.310]  Do they just
[42:16.310 --> 42:17.410]  continue to spawn?
[42:17.810 --> 42:20.770]  I don't think there's an end.
[42:23.890 --> 42:24.370]  Why?
[42:24.530 --> 42:25.870]  I don't know why we need lights
[42:25.870 --> 42:26.890]  when we have night vision.
[42:27.250 --> 42:27.790]  Yeah, no kidding.
[42:31.290 --> 42:32.030]  How's it looking?
[42:33.630 --> 42:34.450]  Almost there.
[42:43.110 --> 42:45.230]  I'm getting absolutely bloody rinsed.
[42:45.230 --> 42:45.530]  Yep.
[42:46.970 --> 42:47.430]  Ow.
[42:47.770 --> 42:49.470]  Just make sure you're eating stuff.
[42:49.790 --> 42:49.990]  Yep.
[42:52.770 --> 42:54.150]  Andrew Panton died.
[42:55.690 --> 42:56.630]  The last guy.
[42:57.390 --> 42:58.970]  I think it was kind of funny
[42:58.970 --> 43:00.230]  because it was like, make sure you're eating stuff.
[43:00.370 --> 43:00.470]  Yep.
[43:01.750 --> 43:02.210]  Okay.
[43:11.170 --> 43:12.550]  I'm really glad that there aren't
[43:12.550 --> 43:13.910]  Pico Park stats for this.
[43:15.370 --> 43:16.670]  Oh, you shouldn't have said that.
[43:17.250 --> 43:18.590]  There will be now!
[43:19.070 --> 43:20.230]  It's too late now.
[43:20.430 --> 43:22.890]  You can't go back 15 videos.
[43:23.590 --> 43:24.810]  That's all
[43:24.810 --> 43:26.710]  these people have is time on their hands.
[43:27.610 --> 43:28.190]  But also,
[43:29.110 --> 43:30.350]  what are you worried about?
[43:30.650 --> 43:32.750]  I have to have like a mile head start on everybody.
[43:33.170 --> 43:34.330]  That's true.
[43:34.590 --> 43:36.850]  You and Gavin. There should actually be
[43:36.850 --> 43:38.850]  a stat for most consequential.
[43:40.110 --> 43:40.250]  Oh.
[43:40.250 --> 43:40.350]  Oh.
[43:44.950 --> 43:46.470]  I'm going to use a different approach this time.
[43:46.990 --> 43:48.490]  I'm going straight to the stairs.
[43:49.230 --> 43:50.750]  Oh my god!
[43:52.670 --> 43:53.770]  How'd your approach do?
[43:54.170 --> 43:56.290]  It blew that dude up. That's how it went.
[43:57.690 --> 43:58.570]  What happened to that guy?
[43:58.730 --> 43:59.350]  He's eating the ground.
[44:00.210 --> 44:00.950]  I died.
[44:01.790 --> 44:02.510]  He's alive!
[44:02.990 --> 44:06.170]  I walked up these stairs and there were just three guys
[44:06.170 --> 44:07.070]  right on top of me. I'm sorry.
[44:07.550 --> 44:08.310]  I'll get you.
[44:09.730 --> 44:10.710]  Alright, Bruce Norris.
[44:10.950 --> 44:12.990]  I was trying to be right behind Andrew
[44:12.990 --> 44:14.610]  and then all of a sudden he was just gone
[44:14.610 --> 44:16.470]  and there were just guys in his wake.
[44:20.220 --> 44:20.580]  Crazy.
[44:24.020 --> 44:26.060]  I'll just slow down. I think I got it.
[44:26.860 --> 44:28.040]  Fourth time charmer!
[44:29.160 --> 44:29.880]  Jesus Christ.
[44:38.430 --> 44:39.170]  Is somebody yelling?
[44:39.450 --> 44:42.470]  Yeah, me. I had to do a big stretch to get into this.
[44:42.470 --> 44:44.630]  Oh, you're catting it up.
[44:44.770 --> 44:46.270]  Yeah. I'm going shmee mode.
[44:48.830 --> 44:49.110]  Meow.
[44:49.710 --> 44:50.970]  The spirit of Jekyll.
[44:52.050 --> 44:54.410]  Oh, you've activated
[44:54.410 --> 44:55.390]  Mr. Jekyll.
[45:01.370 --> 45:02.730]  You've activated...
[45:03.450 --> 45:04.790]  What the hell was that?
[45:04.810 --> 45:06.530]  Gavin committed suicidal.
[45:06.530 --> 45:07.650]  I lost that.
[45:08.450 --> 45:09.650]  What did you do?
[45:10.150 --> 45:11.610]  Mr. Jekyll was so volatile.
[45:13.370 --> 45:15.710]  I was trying to turn on my night vision, but I must have
[45:16.410 --> 45:17.910]  been throwing and activating
[45:17.910 --> 45:19.790]  stickies. I was pressing the wrong keypad.
[45:24.090 --> 45:25.930]  I must have just been throwing bombs
[45:25.930 --> 45:26.570]  in the dark.
[45:28.310 --> 45:29.470]  Fifth time charmers!
[45:34.480 --> 45:35.700]  Oh, look. We moved two feet.
[45:41.680 --> 45:42.980]  It's a fun house at a rough time, you say.
[45:45.680 --> 45:47.680]  This is just time five. We got it.
[45:48.240 --> 45:49.460]  Yeah. Fifth time's
[45:49.460 --> 45:50.660]  a charm, as they say.
[45:50.820 --> 45:52.940]  I felt like we were cooking on that one run.
[45:53.300 --> 45:54.600]  Yeah, we got really close.
[45:55.180 --> 45:56.320]  Well, then Gavin cooked himself.
[45:57.020 --> 45:57.520]  Yeah, I cooked.
[46:07.790 --> 46:08.510]  Oh, God.
[46:12.790 --> 46:13.230]  Jesus
[46:13.690 --> 46:14.790]  Christ, they hit hard.
[46:15.430 --> 46:15.630]  Yeah.
[46:17.370 --> 46:19.310]  There's just a lot. It's a lot,
[46:19.390 --> 46:20.350]  and it's so sudden.
[46:24.130 --> 46:24.530]  Up!
[46:25.390 --> 46:25.950]  I'm alright.
[46:27.070 --> 46:27.710]  Alright, I want to go
[46:27.710 --> 46:28.330]  turret mode.
[46:29.830 --> 46:30.370]  What does that mean?
[46:31.510 --> 46:32.470]  I'm up the stairs.
[46:34.410 --> 46:35.430]  I'm on the second level.
[46:40.750 --> 46:41.550]  Good Lord.
[46:42.050 --> 46:43.650]  Goddamn, what the fuck? Where'd that come from?
[46:43.990 --> 46:44.270]  Oh!
[46:45.810 --> 46:46.210]  Okay.
[46:54.750 --> 46:55.550]  Jesus Christ.
[46:55.550 --> 46:56.670]  Stop shooting me, dickhead.
[46:56.830 --> 46:57.430]  Oh, shit!
[46:59.950 --> 47:00.810]  I see Gavin is
[47:01.590 --> 47:02.990]  reinstituting the classic.
[47:04.910 --> 47:05.390]  Alright, I guess
[47:05.390 --> 47:06.030]  I'm heading upstairs.
[47:12.390 --> 47:12.890]  Fuck!
[47:13.810 --> 47:15.450]  Live! Live, man, live!
[47:16.690 --> 47:17.190]  We're okay.
[47:18.130 --> 47:18.370]  Okay.
[47:22.550 --> 47:23.390]  What the hell?
[47:23.830 --> 47:24.750]  Fucking die.
[47:25.250 --> 47:25.750]  Okay,
[47:27.790 --> 47:28.030]  generators.
[47:28.570 --> 47:29.010]  Generators.
[47:30.590 --> 47:31.030]  Okay.
[47:31.570 --> 47:32.410]  Get him done.
[47:34.130 --> 47:35.710]  Do you need us there also, or
[47:35.710 --> 47:36.250]  you got it?
[47:37.470 --> 47:38.950]  Yeah, is there a minigame involved?
[47:39.630 --> 47:41.130]  Keep the one guy alive.
[47:44.090 --> 47:44.990]  There's more than one.
[47:47.350 --> 47:48.590]  Hey, don't jump down.
[47:49.470 --> 47:49.970]  You'll die.
[47:52.590 --> 47:53.690]  Boy, I thought that was Nick
[47:53.690 --> 47:54.730]  telling us that he just died.
[47:54.730 --> 47:56.170]  No, no, no, no.
[47:57.610 --> 47:58.730]  Okay, waiting for power.
[47:59.570 --> 47:59.910]  Okay.
[48:00.570 --> 48:02.190]  Will it blind us if these are still on?
[48:04.830 --> 48:05.170]  Nope.
[48:06.270 --> 48:07.470]  Oh, yeah, look at this.
[48:13.700 --> 48:14.280]  Who's driving?
[48:16.100 --> 48:17.160]  You. You can, if you want.
[48:18.440 --> 48:20.080]  Let's do it. I mean, you were the closest, so.
[48:20.180 --> 48:21.880]  That's dangerous. Yeah, you are closer. I'm in.
[48:23.200 --> 48:24.000]  I'm coming, I have to
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.200]  go down a lot of stairs.
[48:26.200 --> 48:28.240]  I have so many bullet holes
[48:28.240 --> 48:29.160]  in me.
[48:29.960 --> 48:32.220]  Andrew, there's a guy there. He's by the Milwaukee.
[48:35.040 --> 48:35.740]  Got him.
[48:36.400 --> 48:36.960]  Nice.
[48:37.800 --> 48:38.320]  Getting in.
[48:41.400 --> 48:42.200]  Thanks for
[48:42.200 --> 48:42.600]  waiting.
[48:48.580 --> 48:49.140]  Cool.
[48:51.560 --> 48:53.060]  Sitting at the turret station.
[48:54.440 --> 49:02.470]  Alright, how do I switch to forward?
[49:03.990 --> 49:04.470]  Oh,
[49:04.590 --> 49:05.330]  left, okay.
[49:06.810 --> 49:09.710]  Oh, I hold it.
[49:12.630 --> 49:13.690]  There we go.
[49:15.790 --> 49:18.230]  I'm not shooting at anything yet, just to be safe.
[49:20.270 --> 49:21.290]  Take us to the windmills.
[49:21.870 --> 49:23.330]  No. Let's do it.
[49:25.270 --> 49:26.070]  Why are we going
[49:26.070 --> 49:27.290]  all the way to Polito Bay again?
[49:27.970 --> 49:29.990]  Are you looking out of cameras or are you looking out the windows?
[49:30.650 --> 49:31.990]  I'm in a turret.
[49:32.630 --> 49:33.350]  Oh, nice.
[49:34.950 --> 49:35.890]  I'm just hanging out.
[49:36.130 --> 49:36.190]  Oh, shit.
[49:40.830 --> 49:41.970]  There you go.
[49:43.550 --> 49:44.110]  Oh, man.
[49:47.350 --> 49:49.670]  Hey, they're trying to track us. Let's fire into the city.
[49:54.870 --> 49:55.930]  We're good so far.
[49:56.530 --> 49:58.990]  We like very sideways. Why are we so sideways?
[49:59.270 --> 50:01.090]  We are very sideways for some reason.
[50:01.930 --> 50:02.630]  I was knifing it.
[50:03.590 --> 50:04.430]  No need.
[50:05.010 --> 50:05.590]  Okay.
[50:06.330 --> 50:08.210]  Just normal flying.
[50:09.030 --> 50:09.710]  Alright, yeah.
[50:10.330 --> 50:11.070]  Pair of glasses.
[50:12.550 --> 50:14.430]  Flying in a winter wonderland.
[50:16.390 --> 50:18.010]  Gotta stay in the purple, I think.
[50:23.260 --> 50:24.460]  So far, so good.
[50:25.080 --> 50:25.900]  Yeah, no, you're doing great.
[50:30.890 --> 50:31.930]  Oh, you're doing bad.
[50:32.090 --> 50:32.490]  Okay.
[50:33.090 --> 50:33.750]  Oh, okay.
[50:35.510 --> 50:36.210]  What is this?
[50:39.650 --> 50:41.750]  I just don't want to hear Nick say that.
[50:41.750 --> 50:43.350]  I just don't want to hear Nick say that.
[50:43.790 --> 50:44.190]  What?
[50:45.370 --> 50:46.510]  I went into the hole.
[50:48.170 --> 50:49.330]  So you're just walking around?
[50:49.450 --> 50:51.970]  Yeah, that's how me and Andrew got to the turret seats.
[50:52.330 --> 50:53.530]  Oh, that's cool. Is there another one?
[50:53.810 --> 50:54.550]  Yeah, there should be.
[50:54.830 --> 50:56.130]  Oh, Gavin, what are you doing?
[50:57.450 --> 50:57.850]  Gavin.
[50:58.650 --> 50:59.050]  What?
[50:59.050 --> 50:59.990]  What are you doing?
[51:00.970 --> 51:02.710]  Why are you flying so high?
[51:03.650 --> 51:04.850]  Go down!
[51:05.750 --> 51:06.270]  Gavin.
[51:09.150 --> 51:11.430]  We were coming up on the mountain, so we would've...
[51:11.430 --> 51:13.630]  You've already used your rabbit play.
[51:15.270 --> 51:16.310]  That's a good point.
[51:17.410 --> 51:20.150]  Hey, I'm looking right at the propeller.
[51:20.250 --> 51:21.110]  Can I damage us?
[51:21.950 --> 51:23.030]  I just...
[51:23.030 --> 51:24.150]  It sucks.
[51:24.950 --> 51:26.830]  I'm not gonna fire it.
[51:26.830 --> 51:28.170]  I'm just curious.
[51:30.430 --> 51:31.330]  How do I fire?
[51:31.830 --> 51:32.350]  Oh, that's how.
[51:33.150 --> 51:34.350]  At what point does Nick become a rabbit?
[51:35.010 --> 51:36.550]  I just don't know what he is.
[51:36.690 --> 51:37.950]  I just don't get it.
[51:39.510 --> 51:40.790]  I'm like a fox.
[51:42.690 --> 51:43.170]  Clever?
[51:45.010 --> 51:46.510]  Label yourself as clever?
[51:47.490 --> 51:48.390]  What does that mean?
[51:48.470 --> 51:50.710]  You think you'd watch these videos
[51:50.710 --> 51:52.830]  and be like, that guy is clever like a fox.
[51:53.030 --> 51:53.510]  Absolutely.
[51:56.830 --> 51:57.730]  I like scratches.
[51:58.090 --> 51:59.250]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[52:00.670 --> 52:01.490]  What do you mean?
[52:03.010 --> 52:04.010]  Oh, you...
[52:04.010 --> 52:06.490]  I forgot you could do
[52:06.490 --> 52:08.790]  the vertical landing whatever this was.
[52:09.090 --> 52:09.650]  Yeah, VTOL.
[52:13.190 --> 52:14.010]  You mean VTOL.
[52:14.570 --> 52:16.250]  Whatever Lester was like.
[52:16.430 --> 52:17.230]  Not VTOL.
[52:18.370 --> 52:19.070]  Never VTOL.
[52:20.830 --> 52:21.730]  Wheels out.
[52:25.010 --> 52:25.950]  We did it.
[52:27.590 --> 52:28.070]  Yeah.
[52:29.070 --> 52:29.550]  Nice.
[52:30.070 --> 52:30.930]  Great job.
[52:31.650 --> 52:32.950]  Take that, Funhaus.
[52:48.410 --> 52:49.610]  Thanks, Mr. Jekyll.
[52:52.290 --> 52:54.490]  Well, thanks for watching this one, guys.
[52:54.570 --> 52:56.290]  It's been a heist. We have more heists
[52:56.290 --> 52:58.090]  coming. We're apparently
[52:58.090 --> 52:59.390]  getting right back into it.
[52:59.830 --> 53:01.610]  The rabbit and the fox
[53:02.230 --> 53:04.270]  driving around like morons.
[53:05.330 --> 53:06.470]  Check out the podcast.
[53:06.930 --> 53:07.670]  Check out Patreon.
[53:09.090 --> 53:10.410]  Whoa, that was pretty sick.
[53:11.790 --> 53:12.410]  Thanks for
[53:12.410 --> 53:13.410]  watching this heist.
[53:13.910 --> 53:16.330]  Let us know in the comments, are you more of a Dr. Jekyll
[53:16.330 --> 53:18.290]  or a Mr. Jekyll? If you're asking which one is
[53:18.290 --> 53:20.310]  which, we don't know either. We'll see you next time.
[53:20.390 --> 53:20.730]  Bye!
[53:21.090 --> 53:21.390]  Bye!
