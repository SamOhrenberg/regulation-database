[00:00.480 --> 00:03.980]  You've seen trailers for that Channing Tatum movie about the fake moon landing?
[00:05.480 --> 00:06.200]  That's a...
[00:06.200 --> 00:09.300]  No. New Apple movie? No. Is that a real- is that like a real thing?
[00:09.440 --> 00:15.140]  Yeah, I don't- it is a real movie, but I don't know if it's a real- if it's like a- a dramatized-
[00:15.140 --> 00:20.500]  I don't know. I don't know what they're doing. It's all about they make a fake moon landing in case the real moon landing didn't work.
[00:21.060 --> 00:23.360]  No. Anyway. Oh, get- what the fuck?
[00:24.140 --> 00:28.980]  They're like, it's about Project Artemis. I'm like, is this a real thing? Is this a conspiracy thing?
[00:28.980 --> 00:32.440]  What are we doing here? So stupid. But what are we doing here?
[00:33.420 --> 00:37.440]  What are we doing here is we're looking at The Way of the Dog, which is not actually what we're gonna do,
[00:37.500 --> 00:41.980]  but I just wanted to show you. I've never heard of this game, and I feel like I know a lot about weird,
[00:42.880 --> 00:45.980]  especially Snoop Dogg-based games. This is a Snoop Dogg game.
[00:47.120 --> 00:49.020]  But this is in an era of
[00:50.680 --> 00:57.700]  like weird Xbox arcade games, right? Like... Yes. This is definitely... Oh, we're deep in weird Xbox arcade.
[00:57.700 --> 01:05.080]  Yeah, I mean like like this is way into it. So, I don't know. Let's actually, let's pivot for a quick-
[01:05.080 --> 01:09.740]  let's go a little bit deeper. Let's go to my video and app. I downloaded this yesterday.
[01:10.140 --> 01:12.700]  Because it was one of the things
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.820]  that were available. This has nothing to do with why we're here. I didn't expect to do this,
[01:18.900 --> 01:21.920]  but I mean we've already started this one, so we might as well.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.600]  I feel like I'm about to be blindsided, and I don't like it at all. Like, this is bad.
[01:28.080 --> 01:32.440]  No, listen. This is all about you. You're gonna have a great time with this. Oh, hell yeah.
[01:34.300 --> 01:36.060]  Hell yeah, behind the scenes.
[01:36.260 --> 01:41.840]  Behind the scenes? Wow. Let's get a little preview. Okay. We'll actually play this. Let's restart. Okay.
[01:42.880 --> 01:45.820]  I haven't really seen anything from this game. I don't know how it works.
[01:48.360 --> 01:48.760]  It...
[01:48.760 --> 01:52.340]  Oh, great. Great soundtrack so far. Mm-hmm.
[01:54.540 --> 01:55.440]  There he is.
[01:57.780 --> 01:59.510]  Xbox 360 era Snoop Dogg.
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.160]  Uh-huh.
[02:03.600 --> 02:05.480]  Here's a couple of guys.
[02:09.320 --> 02:16.440]  Oh my god. Get real. Oh, no. Oh, cool. He dropped again.
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.160]  Oh, no. No, we're... Oh, there we go. Oh, no. Yep. Uh-huh. Oh, no. No, we're good.
[02:23.160 --> 02:28.160]  This is... Is the stream still running? Oh, I still see it. There we go. I still see this is...
[02:28.920 --> 02:30.760]  So, it's like a fighting game?
[02:31.840 --> 02:35.100]  I think it's a rhythm... Well, that's good. That's good voice acting.
[02:38.240 --> 02:41.560]  Oh, he did, like, the voice for it and everything. Like...
[02:42.240 --> 02:44.380]  How much money do you think he made from this? But I don't think he's the lead.
[02:45.980 --> 02:50.920]  I think he owes money. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I'm pretty sure he made negative money. It's the way of the dog.
[02:52.740 --> 03:01.820]  I just... So, Snoop Dogg has games or has been in games previous, right?
[03:02.500 --> 03:06.240]  Yes. But I don't know anything about this one.
[03:06.560 --> 03:10.160]  Like, what do you think is the game that Snoop... Like, where you go, like, that's the Snoop Dogg one.
[03:11.080 --> 03:13.120]  Do you have a Snoop Dogg game that you think of?
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.500]  First of all, I'm gonna murder Discord today. Second of all, I believe the question was, what Snoop Dogg game do I think of?
[03:20.500 --> 03:22.800]  I think I like Def Jam. I play for New York.
[03:23.040 --> 03:27.720]  Yep. Yep. That's the one. That is... That's it. That's exactly the one that I think of.
[03:28.100 --> 03:31.500]  I think it's probably the one most people think of. Oh, Mississippi Grind. Cool.
[03:32.660 --> 03:39.100]  I own two movies on my Xbox store. I own Mississippi Grind and Daybreakers for some reason.
[03:39.620 --> 03:44.860]  I think I got Daybreakers for free. Mississippi Grind. One of my favorite movies of all time. I think it's Ryan Reynolds' best work.
[03:44.960 --> 03:47.200]  Is it? Is that really your favorite movie of all time?
[03:47.840 --> 03:53.660]  No, it's up there. It's top five. My favorite movie is probably Bottle Rocket, but it's... That's cool.
[03:54.640 --> 03:56.560]  I think it's definitely Ryan Reynolds' best work.
[03:56.720 --> 04:03.720]  I think... When they're at the dog track and have like... I think that's a really great scene. I think there's a lot to that movie that's very good.
[04:04.720 --> 04:10.360]  Yeah, I love the pool hustling scene where they think that he's like a shark, but he's just... He's actually inept.
[04:11.640 --> 04:16.640]  Here's a preview of some of the weird games that I bought for us to check out at some point.
[04:16.640 --> 04:17.020]  Okay.
[04:17.440 --> 04:20.380]  Bellator, everyone's favorite MMA organization.
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.760]  I don't... NCA basketball, MME, I don't know... I don't know anything about this.
[04:26.760 --> 04:27.920]  Orch Madness Edition?
[04:28.260 --> 04:28.480]  Okay.
[04:29.040 --> 04:30.080]  I guess, yeah.
[04:30.640 --> 04:31.480]  The Expendables 2.
[04:31.600 --> 04:31.800]  Oh.
[04:31.960 --> 04:36.960]  One of the great regrets I've ever made is not buying this, but I do have the demo.
[04:37.260 --> 04:38.080]  Oh, I have.
[04:38.300 --> 04:39.100]  It is a joy.
[04:39.320 --> 04:40.120]  I have that game.
[04:40.820 --> 04:42.380]  Oh, you bought The Expendables 2?
[04:42.500 --> 04:43.060]  I'm pretty sure.
[04:43.060 --> 04:44.600]  Maybe we'll do like a King of the Torch.
[04:44.600 --> 04:46.420]  I'm pretty sure that I have this game.
[04:46.640 --> 04:49.320]  It's almost like a top-down shooter thing.
[04:50.100 --> 04:52.740]  And they have different characters that have different guns, I think.
[04:52.940 --> 04:53.580]  Oh my god.
[04:59.500 --> 05:01.560]  It's a top-down twin-stick shooter.
[05:02.320 --> 05:02.660]  I know.
[05:03.040 --> 05:04.280]  Discord is so bad.
[05:04.340 --> 05:05.500]  What is going on?
[05:06.820 --> 05:07.340]  I don't know.
[05:07.600 --> 05:09.740]  Do we want to reboot, or do we just keep going?
[05:10.720 --> 05:11.900]  Let's just keep going.
[05:11.900 --> 05:13.540]  We'll figure out.
[05:13.880 --> 05:15.240]  This is a problem for an editor, right?
[05:15.440 --> 05:16.240]  Is that us now?
[05:16.580 --> 05:16.780]  Sure.
[05:16.940 --> 05:17.460]  Sorry, Nick.
[05:17.620 --> 05:18.520]  Yeah, it is us.
[05:20.340 --> 05:21.380]  Nick, be clear.
[05:21.480 --> 05:22.380]  This is Eric's call.
[05:22.920 --> 05:24.060]  I did ask for a reset.
[05:24.180 --> 05:29.080]  I don't think there's any way we can reset and save anything we're doing, so I think it is what it is.
[05:30.200 --> 05:31.740]  Why did you select Ratatouille?
[05:31.980 --> 05:32.260]  What?
[05:32.460 --> 05:34.300]  Because you're a known rat guy.
[05:34.320 --> 05:34.840]  Wait a second.
[05:34.840 --> 05:35.680]  Big rat fan.
[05:35.680 --> 05:37.020]  This isn't Snoop Dogg?
[05:38.080 --> 05:38.480]  No.
[05:39.360 --> 05:40.920]  This has nothing to do with Snoop Dogg.
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.060]  This is all about Ratatouille.
[05:42.460 --> 05:43.820]  We're going to the rat games.
[05:43.900 --> 05:44.500]  Hang on.
[05:45.040 --> 05:47.500]  I thought we were playing the Snoop Dogg game.
[05:47.740 --> 05:49.460]  No, that was just all an aside.
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.320]  I just was excited about it.
[05:51.520 --> 05:52.700]  Stop blindsiding me.
[05:52.940 --> 05:54.760]  Stop blindsiding me.
[05:54.760 --> 05:58.900]  I did say, but Discord probably cut out, that we were not doing Snoop Dogg today.
[05:59.560 --> 06:00.360]  This is Ratatouille.
[06:00.460 --> 06:01.320]  You're a known rat guy.
[06:01.680 --> 06:04.680]  We are playing what might be the number one rat game.
[06:05.000 --> 06:05.680]  We'll have to see.
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.000]  Nobody said this would be easy.
[06:08.280 --> 06:10.240]  Yeah, nobody said this would be easy for sure.
[06:10.240 --> 06:12.780]  Nobody would say this is easy.
[06:13.000 --> 06:13.320]  Uh-huh.
[06:13.360 --> 06:14.120]  New game.
[06:14.580 --> 06:15.120]  Uh-huh.
[06:15.320 --> 06:15.860]  Great.
[06:16.220 --> 06:17.620]  Ooh, I'm an active gamer.
[06:18.100 --> 06:19.900]  I will accept those terms.
[06:20.460 --> 06:21.740]  I'm an active gamer.
[06:21.820 --> 06:24.060]  I hope the server doesn't work and it doesn't let you in.
[06:25.680 --> 06:29.240]  That would be bad, because I think I paid 20 bucks for this game.
[06:29.440 --> 06:30.300]  Oh my God.
[06:31.080 --> 06:31.440]  Okay.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.760]  First, we got to get a bonus.
[06:34.040 --> 06:34.280]  Okay.
[06:34.980 --> 06:35.260]  Okay.
[06:36.320 --> 06:37.420]  What the fuck?
[06:38.420 --> 06:39.560]  Ratatouille goes mobile?
[06:41.260 --> 06:44.400]  Join now to get information about the wireless game wallpaper's ringtones.
[06:44.620 --> 06:45.460]  Oh God.
[06:45.600 --> 06:46.520]  Where's my phone?
[06:47.180 --> 06:48.120]  I need to get a ringtone.
[06:48.300 --> 06:49.820]  You should not text that number.
[06:50.040 --> 06:53.660]  You should not text rats to 84746.
[06:54.200 --> 06:54.380]  No.
[06:54.820 --> 06:55.840]  I'm going to text rats.
[06:55.920 --> 06:56.740]  Oh my God.
[06:57.360 --> 06:57.700]  No.
[06:57.920 --> 06:59.160]  I think you're going to get charged.
[06:59.460 --> 07:01.160]  Your Umi Digi is going to get charged.
[07:01.740 --> 07:02.980]  I got the bits, Eric.
[07:03.000 --> 07:03.880]  Don't worry about it.
[07:04.400 --> 07:08.520]  While you do that, I'm going to go to mobile.thq.com and see what happens.
[07:10.020 --> 07:12.480]  I was thinking about it.
[07:13.180 --> 07:15.400]  Mobile.thq.com might not be a website anymore.
[07:15.520 --> 07:17.120]  We might have to purchase this domain.
[07:19.920 --> 07:21.560]  Well, THQ got shut down.
[07:21.640 --> 07:21.980]  I know.
[07:22.040 --> 07:22.740]  They no longer exist.
[07:23.360 --> 07:25.360]  And neither does mobile.thq.com.
[07:25.540 --> 07:27.420]  I don't know if THQ.com exists.
[07:27.700 --> 07:28.640]  Oh, there it goes.
[07:28.680 --> 07:29.600]  It goes to the Nordic site.
[07:29.740 --> 07:30.120]  Oh wow.
[07:30.300 --> 07:30.920]  It's bad.
[07:32.020 --> 07:33.060]  Oh, it's slow.
[07:33.660 --> 07:34.220]  Oh no.
[07:34.360 --> 07:36.860]  Messages would like to send a message to 84746.
[07:37.100 --> 07:39.060]  This may cause charges on your mobile account.
[07:39.060 --> 07:39.800]  Send?
[07:40.660 --> 07:43.240]  I mean, you sent the text RATS, right?
[07:44.260 --> 07:45.820]  I sent RATS3.
[07:46.420 --> 07:48.060]  Oh, so you can get the ringtone?
[07:48.800 --> 07:50.080]  I want the ringtone.
[07:50.460 --> 07:50.820]  Okay.
[07:51.780 --> 07:56.460]  Listen, I don't know if the UmiDigi can run that mobile game, but I want the ringtone.
[07:57.420 --> 07:58.940]  I'll see if anything comes of this.
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.900]  Yeah, we'll let you know as we go.
[08:00.980 --> 08:02.440]  We'll see if the UmiDigi gets a text.
[08:02.540 --> 08:03.180]  I don't care about mobile.
[08:03.180 --> 08:04.500]  Why are we watching the Wall-
[08:04.500 --> 08:08.920]  We don't need a teaser for Wall-E, a movie that came out ten plus years ago.
[08:10.240 --> 08:10.640]  Waste!
[08:13.540 --> 08:14.860]  I don't think I've ever seen this.
[08:15.060 --> 08:16.260]  You've never seen Wall-E?
[08:16.560 --> 08:18.400]  No, I've seen Wall-E. I haven't seen this trailer.
[08:18.540 --> 08:20.900]  Who cares? You've seen Wall-E.
[08:21.560 --> 08:24.740]  It's in the bonus features, Eric. It's part of the experience.
[08:25.760 --> 08:28.320]  $20 of getting every bit of this game.
[08:28.420 --> 08:32.580]  I also thought that we're going to play Snoop Dogg.
[08:33.620 --> 08:37.180]  We'll play Snoop Dogg some other time. We've got plenty of time to play Snoop Dogg.
[08:37.180 --> 08:38.620]  We're all about rats today.
[08:40.380 --> 08:42.560]  We need to figure out what the number one rat game is.
[08:42.760 --> 08:46.840]  Wall-E came out in 2008. This trailer sucks.
[08:48.280 --> 08:48.820]  That's a teaser.
[08:49.680 --> 08:50.660]  It's really long.
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.380]  In their defense.
[08:52.420 --> 08:52.840]  It is.
[08:55.260 --> 08:56.380]  Oh, my God.
[08:56.700 --> 08:57.340]  Oh, man.
[08:57.660 --> 08:57.880]  L.
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.120]  Lifter.
[09:03.240 --> 09:04.660]  You don't love this?
[09:04.840 --> 09:05.060]  No!
[09:05.060 --> 09:07.760]  You don't love the same use of the schematic over and over again?
[09:08.080 --> 09:09.400]  Oh, my God.
[09:10.380 --> 09:12.320]  Wall-E could flip you off right now.
[09:12.420 --> 09:14.040]  I already know what this guy does.
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.660]  He's a trash man.
[09:19.260 --> 09:21.380]  Have you ever seen After Earth?
[09:23.440 --> 09:25.700]  Is that the John Travolta thing?
[09:26.480 --> 09:27.680]  No, it's the Will Smith.
[09:28.380 --> 09:30.140]  Oh, is that the one with his kid?
[09:30.220 --> 09:30.580]  M. Night.
[09:30.920 --> 09:34.100]  No, I haven't seen After Earth.
[09:35.660 --> 09:38.800]  I have been on a run of M. Night movies.
[09:38.800 --> 09:39.620]  Oh, no.
[09:40.320 --> 09:43.100]  I've been watching all the M. Night movies I haven't seen recently.
[09:45.280 --> 09:47.480]  Most average movie I think I've ever seen.
[09:48.940 --> 09:50.300]  There's nothing good about it.
[09:50.460 --> 09:50.980]  Okay, we're done.
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.240]  Oh, thank fucking God.
[09:52.320 --> 09:54.440]  Good bonus lock, bonus lock, bonus lock, bonus lock.
[09:54.560 --> 09:54.740]  Yes.
[09:55.220 --> 09:55.500]  Good.
[09:56.040 --> 09:57.440]  Now we're forced to play the game.
[09:58.100 --> 09:58.280]  Great.
[09:58.880 --> 09:59.120]  Cool.
[09:59.860 --> 10:01.940]  Collect the charms for access to other areas.
[10:02.080 --> 10:02.280]  Okay.
[10:02.960 --> 10:03.180]  Great.
[10:03.860 --> 10:04.640]  Classic WALL-E.
[10:04.820 --> 10:05.280]  Or WALL-E.
[10:05.420 --> 10:07.080]  Classic WALL-E.
[10:07.240 --> 10:08.540]  Classic ratatouille shit.
[10:10.160 --> 10:12.920]  Do you think Pat and Oswald provided his voice for this game?
[10:12.980 --> 10:13.240]  Absolutely.
[10:13.300 --> 10:13.520]  Yes.
[10:13.600 --> 10:15.020]  Do you think there are any celebrities?
[10:15.160 --> 10:15.360]  Yes.
[10:15.560 --> 10:16.560]  I think Pat and Oswald did.
[10:16.600 --> 10:16.960]  Let's see.
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.860]  It just seems like a thing where he's like, I'll do video games.
[10:22.100 --> 10:22.580]  Oh, yeah.
[10:22.620 --> 10:24.220]  He'd definitely be willing to do video games.
[10:28.350 --> 10:29.550]  I should be paying attention.
[10:29.730 --> 10:30.650]  I would think so, yeah.
[10:30.670 --> 10:31.750]  Showing me where all this stuff is.
[10:32.870 --> 10:34.030]  Oh, look at all these rats.
[10:35.150 --> 10:35.630]  Ugh.
[10:37.310 --> 10:39.190]  I can't believe you're sighing at rats.
[10:40.870 --> 10:42.010]  Oh, that's definitely Pat and Oswald.
[10:42.050 --> 10:42.890]  That's what I'm saying!
[10:45.410 --> 10:46.450]  He hates that.
[10:47.850 --> 10:48.530]  Oh, hell yeah.
[10:48.550 --> 10:49.830]  Tony Hawk vs. Gator 5.
[10:49.830 --> 10:49.970]  Tony Hawk vs. Gator 5.
[10:50.450 --> 10:51.410]  Downloaded, guys.
[10:51.930 --> 10:56.530]  They delisted it everywhere else, but they forgot it on the 360 Marketplace.
[10:59.610 --> 11:00.430]  Oh, my God.
[11:02.370 --> 11:03.330]  All right.
[11:03.430 --> 11:05.710]  Yeah, don't yell too loud, you rats.
[11:05.890 --> 11:07.010]  You might wake up a person.
[11:09.870 --> 11:12.030]  Janine Garofalo did her voice in this also.
[11:12.990 --> 11:13.470]  Oh, really?
[11:13.930 --> 11:15.890]  Brian Dennehy also did his voice.
[11:17.070 --> 11:17.470]  Perfect.
[11:21.330 --> 11:23.170]  Nolan North did a voice also.
[11:25.190 --> 11:27.070]  That might be Nolan North talking right now.
[11:27.090 --> 11:27.790]  It might be.
[11:30.470 --> 11:33.090]  I just assume Nolan North is in every video game.
[11:33.090 --> 11:35.270]  Yeah, I would think so.
[11:37.050 --> 11:42.370]  If I was a kid and I wanted to play Ratatouille, I would just get to it.
[11:44.690 --> 11:45.670]  Yeah, I know.
[11:45.690 --> 11:46.710]  You don't like the setup?
[11:50.690 --> 11:52.270]  It's rat time. Let's go.
[11:52.490 --> 11:54.490]  Why are we hanging out? Quit talking.
[11:54.530 --> 11:58.430]  Welcome to Remy's home, Mabel's farm. Here you'll learn what your job is in the colony.
[11:58.670 --> 11:59.530]  I didn't know they were in a colony.
[11:59.530 --> 12:01.010]  Do rats live in a colony?
[12:02.370 --> 12:03.550]  Oh, this is weird.
[12:06.670 --> 12:10.290]  You push left to look right and right to look left.
[12:10.550 --> 12:13.430]  It's a very strange camera choice.
[12:14.230 --> 12:15.330]  We gotta look for these coins.
[12:15.770 --> 12:20.050]  So is the purpose of playing this determining what is the best rat game?
[12:20.250 --> 12:25.470]  I think overall it's probably the series of this, but I mean, you're just a rat, guys.
[12:25.610 --> 12:27.170]  I figured you would like this.
[12:27.310 --> 12:27.590]  No.
[12:29.530 --> 12:31.030]  Did you like the movie, Ratatouille?
[12:31.310 --> 12:32.990]  It was fine.
[12:34.570 --> 12:41.890]  I like it in the same way that I like Toy Story 3, where you're just sort of like, yeah, I mean, I guess.
[12:41.930 --> 12:42.110]  Really?
[12:42.450 --> 12:43.490]  Yeah, it's all like that.
[12:43.710 --> 12:45.610]  Oh, I thought Toy Story 3 was great.
[12:46.490 --> 12:48.230]  Was it better than Ratatouille?
[12:49.310 --> 12:53.890]  In my opinion, much better. Yeah, I didn't really like Ratatouille. People just love this movie.
[12:54.530 --> 12:55.770]  Why didn't you like Ratatouille?
[12:56.470 --> 12:59.310]  I just, I don't know. I just didn't connect.
[13:00.190 --> 13:02.170]  Oh, hell yeah, buttons back one unlock!
[13:02.710 --> 13:03.550]  Fuck yeah.
[13:04.310 --> 13:04.590]  Okay.
[13:04.850 --> 13:05.330]  Boo!
[13:06.190 --> 13:11.050]  I will say, if Ratatouille was fucking breaking cans with his tail, I probably would have liked that movie.
[13:11.050 --> 13:11.290]  Yeah.
[13:12.030 --> 13:12.210]  Yeah.
[13:16.070 --> 13:17.990]  You have to use something explosive?
[13:21.250 --> 13:23.190]  You gotta blow this fucking up.
[13:27.330 --> 13:28.410]  Oh, shit.
[13:28.910 --> 13:29.450]  Great.
[13:30.330 --> 13:31.830]  Oh, he's gonna fucking die.
[13:32.130 --> 13:32.690]  Uh-oh.
[13:35.110 --> 13:36.170]  Aw, man.
[13:36.350 --> 13:37.090]  He got lucky.
[13:39.790 --> 13:40.550]  That's a great question.
[13:40.570 --> 13:42.130]  Can you imagine if movies had tutorials?
[13:44.150 --> 13:50.810]  That's what I'm saying, like, this is so much talking for a video game and not a lot of rat action.
[13:52.950 --> 13:53.490]  Okay.
[13:55.210 --> 13:56.210]  What the fuck?
[13:56.330 --> 13:59.090]  Put it on the location that it needs to be.
[13:59.310 --> 14:01.810]  That's not where it needs to be, clearly.
[14:02.190 --> 14:03.510]  That's not where it needs to be.
[14:04.110 --> 14:05.170]  Oh, my God.
[14:07.610 --> 14:08.870]  Wait, wait a second.
[14:10.490 --> 14:12.330]  How is that not where...
[14:13.010 --> 14:14.430]  What am I doing wrong?
[14:15.810 --> 14:16.670]  What am I...
[14:17.190 --> 14:19.150]  It's right there, it's in the green...
[14:19.150 --> 14:20.370]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[14:20.930 --> 14:21.270]  Ah!
[14:21.890 --> 14:23.130]  Get the fuck out of here!
[14:24.730 --> 14:25.470]  Oh, my God.
[14:25.650 --> 14:26.390]  Oh, I can sprint.
[14:26.570 --> 14:27.110]  Oh, finally.
[14:28.290 --> 14:28.590]  Okay.
[14:29.470 --> 14:30.190]  Rat dash.
[14:30.330 --> 14:31.130]  What's going on with you?
[14:31.210 --> 14:31.930]  Yeah, who's that?
[14:32.110 --> 14:32.890]  Oh, he doesn't like that.
[14:33.010 --> 14:34.790]  Oh, fuck you. Fuck you, buddy. Fuck you, bud.
[14:36.210 --> 14:36.830]  Hey, you.
[14:37.690 --> 14:39.850]  Oh, you're just attacking the rats.
[14:40.790 --> 14:42.550]  I'm getting my dominance in the colony.
[14:42.690 --> 14:43.050]  Oh, wait.
[14:43.310 --> 14:45.350]  To use the ball, jump towards the ball, press B.
[14:46.150 --> 14:46.770]  Oh, hell yeah.
[14:46.870 --> 14:47.510]  Oh, wow!
[14:47.550 --> 14:48.270]  Oh, shit.
[14:48.590 --> 14:49.350]  Oh, fuck.
[14:49.530 --> 14:50.210]  Oh, my God.
[14:50.210 --> 14:51.030]  Oh, no.
[14:51.070 --> 14:51.730]  Oh, no.
[14:51.890 --> 14:52.150]  Okay.
[14:52.270 --> 14:52.570]  Oh, no!
[14:52.810 --> 14:53.030]  Okay.
[14:53.650 --> 14:57.070]  Oh, this camera is so hard.
[14:57.350 --> 14:57.670]  This is...
[14:58.150 --> 14:58.730]  Oh, my God.
[14:58.890 --> 15:00.570]  This is, like, impossible.
[15:01.090 --> 15:02.350]  I want the blue coin.
[15:03.970 --> 15:06.190]  I bet you there's a bonus behind that blue coin.
[15:06.270 --> 15:06.790]  Oh, my God.
[15:07.990 --> 15:09.130]  Wait, wait.
[15:09.290 --> 15:10.130]  Get locked in.
[15:10.950 --> 15:11.170]  Go.
[15:11.590 --> 15:11.730]  Oh!
[15:12.470 --> 15:12.950]  Nice.
[15:13.210 --> 15:13.890]  Now, hit that umbrella.
[15:14.110 --> 15:14.710]  There you go.
[15:15.570 --> 15:16.050]  Cool.
[15:16.390 --> 15:17.130]  What the hell?
[15:17.550 --> 15:17.850]  Oh!
[15:17.850 --> 15:18.290]  Oh!
[15:19.030 --> 15:19.610]  Jump down with it.
[15:20.330 --> 15:21.290]  This is like worms.
[15:21.530 --> 15:21.710]  Okay.
[15:21.950 --> 15:22.290]  Yeah.
[15:22.410 --> 15:23.690]  Yeah, and you fell just like worms.
[15:23.810 --> 15:24.110]  Way to go.
[15:24.430 --> 15:25.430]  Yeah, exactly like worms.
[15:26.230 --> 15:27.470]  So, you need a chili pepper.
[15:28.530 --> 15:29.150]  I do.
[15:30.790 --> 15:32.210]  Oh, get the fuck out of here, bird.
[15:33.490 --> 15:34.310]  Can I break those?
[15:34.510 --> 15:35.910]  You're a different kind of animal.
[15:37.190 --> 15:37.950]  I'm a rat.
[15:38.750 --> 15:39.870]  This grass looks like it needs some water.
[15:39.950 --> 15:41.750]  Find the valve and fix the sprinkler.
[15:42.450 --> 15:42.850]  Okay.
[15:43.550 --> 15:44.990]  For a fucking valve.
[15:46.870 --> 15:47.270]  Uh...
[15:47.270 --> 15:48.950]  This is a, um...
[15:48.950 --> 15:50.350]  This is like a big first level.
[15:51.570 --> 15:53.370]  It is really big spaces.
[15:53.530 --> 15:54.490]  I'm glad they designed this.
[15:54.610 --> 15:55.210]  This is great.
[15:56.210 --> 15:57.790]  Utilizing every inch they can.
[15:59.830 --> 16:00.230]  Uh...
[16:00.230 --> 16:01.490]  What's going on over here?
[16:01.610 --> 16:02.430]  I feel like...
[16:02.430 --> 16:02.450]  Oh.
[16:02.610 --> 16:09.650]  I feel like there are game devs who worked on this who are working on, like, big projects now.
[16:09.750 --> 16:10.370]  And they're like, oh, yeah.
[16:10.430 --> 16:12.310]  Like, my second game ever was like that Ratatouille game.
[16:14.870 --> 16:15.310]  Ew.
[16:15.590 --> 16:16.470]  Okay, okay.
[16:16.630 --> 16:17.390]  You got up on the car.
[16:17.610 --> 16:18.050]  Now what?
[16:18.590 --> 16:19.030]  Don't.
[16:19.330 --> 16:20.270]  I think that might have been it.
[16:21.970 --> 16:23.230]  Oh, there's the valve.
[16:26.490 --> 16:27.250]  What am I...
[16:27.250 --> 16:27.930]  There you go.
[16:29.090 --> 16:29.530]  Nope.
[16:29.890 --> 16:30.410]  Can you pick it up?
[16:30.590 --> 16:30.850]  There you go.
[16:31.130 --> 16:31.270]  Ah!
[16:31.810 --> 16:32.430]  Fuck off.
[16:33.470 --> 16:33.990]  What'd he do?
[16:33.990 --> 16:36.090]  Did that squirrel just eat the fucking valve?
[16:36.770 --> 16:37.210]  Yeah.
[16:37.690 --> 16:38.190]  Holy shit.
[16:38.190 --> 16:38.810]  You gotta go hit him.
[16:38.890 --> 16:39.270]  Go hit him.
[16:40.230 --> 16:40.830]  Go hit him.
[16:40.830 --> 16:41.490]  Punch him.
[16:42.690 --> 16:43.230]  Get back here.
[16:43.270 --> 16:43.610]  Rat attack.
[16:43.630 --> 16:44.590]  Give me back my valve.
[16:45.250 --> 16:46.130]  Give me back...
[16:46.130 --> 16:47.170]  There you go.
[16:47.230 --> 16:47.510]  Pick it up.
[16:47.610 --> 16:48.150]  Go, go, go.
[16:49.430 --> 16:49.790]  One.
[16:50.550 --> 16:50.910]  Two.
[16:51.130 --> 16:51.450]  Ah!
[16:51.650 --> 16:52.010]  Shit.
[16:55.090 --> 16:56.110]  Oh, he's down for the count.
[16:56.410 --> 16:56.950]  Go, run.
[16:57.130 --> 16:57.770]  Go, go, go.
[16:57.770 --> 16:58.250]  You gotta get out of here.
[16:58.390 --> 16:58.770]  Go, go, go.
[16:58.990 --> 17:00.410]  He's coming for you.
[17:03.930 --> 17:05.430]  Okay, let's fix this garden.
[17:05.670 --> 17:06.030]  Okay.
[17:06.370 --> 17:07.210]  This is good.
[17:07.870 --> 17:10.350]  Dumb fucking rat that makes me do all the work.
[17:10.530 --> 17:11.650]  Bunch of lazy asses around here.
[17:11.670 --> 17:11.910]  There you go.
[17:12.030 --> 17:12.670]  Now whip it.
[17:13.110 --> 17:13.550]  Bam!
[17:15.690 --> 17:18.310]  There, now you can hop up.
[17:18.790 --> 17:19.350]  Get that coin.
[17:20.530 --> 17:22.950]  Yeah, I don't think that's gonna be the way to do it.
[17:25.230 --> 17:25.710]  I'm shortcut.
[17:26.190 --> 17:26.750]  Wait, wait.
[17:28.250 --> 17:28.790]  Wait a second.
[17:28.970 --> 17:29.150]  Okay.
[17:29.530 --> 17:30.030]  Wait a second.
[17:30.170 --> 17:30.390]  Okay.
[17:31.170 --> 17:31.550]  Uh-huh.
[17:31.930 --> 17:32.390]  Shortcut.
[17:32.930 --> 17:33.390]  Fuck.
[17:33.770 --> 17:34.070]  Okay.
[17:35.450 --> 17:35.810]  Ugh.
[17:38.310 --> 17:39.490]  What am I supposed to do?
[17:39.570 --> 17:39.870]  I don't know.
[17:39.950 --> 17:40.710]  Can you not jump on it?
[17:41.630 --> 17:41.990]  No.
[17:42.370 --> 17:44.290]  I mean, it seems like that's what you would do, right?
[17:44.330 --> 17:44.770]  As you jump on the...
[17:44.770 --> 17:46.110]  And it's glowing blue.
[17:46.130 --> 17:46.330]  Yeah.
[17:46.330 --> 17:47.570]  In a way that's like, hey.
[17:48.430 --> 17:50.010]  Like there's something you gotta do.
[17:50.150 --> 17:51.390]  Maybe you have to learn something.
[17:51.630 --> 17:51.910]  Yeah.
[17:52.350 --> 17:53.030]  I feel like...
[17:53.590 --> 17:54.430]  Look out for the chickens!
[17:54.590 --> 17:54.810]  Whoa!
[17:55.050 --> 17:55.210]  Whoa!
[17:55.390 --> 17:55.670]  Whoa!
[17:55.970 --> 17:56.330]  Whoa!
[17:56.330 --> 17:56.570]  Whoa!
[17:58.130 --> 17:58.750]  Get away!
[17:59.010 --> 17:59.330]  Get away!
[18:00.770 --> 18:01.130]  Whoa!
[18:01.170 --> 18:01.510]  No!
[18:01.510 --> 18:01.790]  No!
[18:02.650 --> 18:03.670]  Take a break, stuff!
[18:05.510 --> 18:06.390]  Going back in.
[18:06.910 --> 18:07.630]  Okay, be careful.
[18:07.850 --> 18:08.170]  There has to be something.
[18:08.350 --> 18:08.510]  No!
[18:11.190 --> 18:12.350]  Oh, there's a green.
[18:12.550 --> 18:12.690]  Oh.
[18:13.230 --> 18:13.910]  Take that.
[18:14.430 --> 18:14.850]  Oh, it's health.
[18:14.850 --> 18:15.170]  Oh, it's health.
[18:16.750 --> 18:17.510]  Fuck you, too.
[18:17.670 --> 18:18.330]  Take that, chickens.
[18:19.510 --> 18:20.530]  There's nothing else in here?
[18:20.670 --> 18:21.870]  There's nothing else in here.
[18:22.590 --> 18:23.230]  Oh, there is.
[18:23.330 --> 18:23.630]  Up there.
[18:23.810 --> 18:25.030]  There's a blue coin up there.
[18:27.390 --> 18:27.790]  Yeah.
[18:27.990 --> 18:29.170]  How do I...
[18:29.170 --> 18:30.510]  How do I get up there?
[18:30.510 --> 18:31.150]  How do I get up here?
[18:32.630 --> 18:33.450]  I'll be back.
[18:33.690 --> 18:34.010]  Yeah.
[18:34.110 --> 18:34.590]  Be back, chickens.
[18:36.550 --> 18:37.490]  Maybe go over.
[18:37.690 --> 18:38.750]  Grab those blue coins.
[18:38.870 --> 18:39.830]  Maybe you'll learn some more things.
[18:39.850 --> 18:40.530]  Oh, there's that pepper.
[18:40.610 --> 18:41.810]  You can bring that pepper over to the right.
[18:41.830 --> 18:41.870]  Oh, the pepper.
[18:42.050 --> 18:42.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:42.630 --> 18:44.150]  I'm gonna go blow up that thing with the pepper.
[18:44.310 --> 18:44.950]  Yeah, this is good.
[18:47.530 --> 18:47.850]  Okay.
[18:50.070 --> 18:51.510]  You know, this is very...
[18:53.190 --> 18:57.190]  I wanna say like Mario Brothers gameplay for like a rat game.
[18:58.150 --> 18:58.470]  Yeah.
[18:58.950 --> 19:02.190]  With the bad camera controls, it's making me think of like Super Mario Sunshine.
[19:02.290 --> 19:03.290]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:03.350 --> 19:03.790]  Big time.
[19:04.090 --> 19:04.450]  Ooh.
[19:05.510 --> 19:06.410]  There you go.
[19:06.550 --> 19:07.590]  Give me another collectible.
[19:07.670 --> 19:08.090]  Oh, no!
[19:08.610 --> 19:09.330]  Stink bugs!
[19:09.570 --> 19:10.110]  Fuck off!
[19:11.570 --> 19:12.030]  Oh, man.
[19:12.050 --> 19:12.590]  I'm losing health.
[19:12.590 --> 19:14.190]  So, can you bring the umbrella down there?
[19:14.890 --> 19:15.970]  Is that what the umbrella...
[19:15.970 --> 19:17.990]  Yeah, down there.
[19:18.410 --> 19:19.510]  Is that where you're supposed to take the umbrella?
[19:20.910 --> 19:21.310]  Maybe.
[19:22.170 --> 19:23.290]  I feel like you are.
[19:23.370 --> 19:24.110]  Let's break this.
[19:24.730 --> 19:25.050]  Okay.
[19:26.070 --> 19:26.870]  But now...
[19:26.870 --> 19:27.650]  That did nothing.
[19:27.650 --> 19:28.350]  No.
[19:29.010 --> 19:29.490]  Shortcut.
[19:29.970 --> 19:30.390]  Nope.
[19:30.630 --> 19:30.670]  Shit.
[19:32.810 --> 19:35.790]  I mean, are you gonna chance rolling the ball all the way over there again?
[19:37.490 --> 19:38.090]  I can do it.
[19:38.130 --> 19:39.030]  I mastered it.
[19:39.050 --> 19:39.510]  Okay.
[19:39.770 --> 19:40.050]  Easy.
[19:40.310 --> 19:40.570]  Cool.
[19:41.490 --> 19:41.970]  Easy.
[19:42.330 --> 19:43.610]  I have a friend, Garrett.
[19:43.850 --> 19:44.230]  Speedrun.
[19:44.430 --> 19:46.630]  At Mega64 who was taking acting classes.
[19:47.210 --> 19:48.670]  And when he...
[19:49.370 --> 19:51.870]  In his first acting class, he's like, alright, you're gonna do like a monologue.
[19:52.050 --> 19:56.650]  So, like memorize this monologue and then, you know, perform it in front of the class.
[19:56.650 --> 19:57.470]  And so he did that.
[19:57.930 --> 19:58.510]  Memorized it.
[19:58.730 --> 20:02.010]  And then they gave him some notes and then they're like, oh, you should memorize it again.
[20:02.090 --> 20:03.950]  And he went, no, I feel like I mastered it.
[20:05.350 --> 20:07.890]  So I think about that a lot.
[20:10.370 --> 20:11.350]  There you go.
[20:11.870 --> 20:12.430]  Look at you.
[20:12.630 --> 20:13.230]  It's just like Fortnite.
[20:14.210 --> 20:15.310]  Oh, you have to land?
[20:15.990 --> 20:16.630]  You have to land?
[20:16.650 --> 20:17.750]  Dude, no way.
[20:18.310 --> 20:19.570]  I don't think I do.
[20:19.710 --> 20:20.390]  I think...
[20:20.390 --> 20:21.610]  You really think that's something?
[20:21.730 --> 20:22.410]  I have no idea.
[20:22.590 --> 20:23.010]  I don't know.
[20:23.470 --> 20:23.950]  No, just...
[20:23.950 --> 20:24.030]  Okay.
[20:24.030 --> 20:24.910]  We're gonna try one more time.
[20:25.070 --> 20:26.110]  Okay, let's try one more time.
[20:26.570 --> 20:28.230]  You've mastered the ball, so why not?
[20:29.050 --> 20:29.530]  It's easy.
[20:29.690 --> 20:29.850]  Yeah.
[20:30.150 --> 20:31.550]  Oh, yeah, it's baby mode, you know?
[20:31.670 --> 20:32.690]  I think...
[20:32.690 --> 20:35.030]  Are monologues the tutorial of cinema?
[20:35.750 --> 20:36.790]  That's a great...
[20:37.130 --> 20:39.130]  That's a great, uh...
[20:39.130 --> 20:39.530]  Thought.
[20:39.750 --> 20:43.770]  I mean, I wanna say no, but I'm gonna say yes just to be like, you know, agreeable.
[20:43.990 --> 20:48.030]  Well, you know, like, not necessarily, like monologues I guess can be powerful, but like...
[20:49.150 --> 20:49.470]  Exposition.
[20:49.890 --> 20:50.210]  Uh-huh.
[20:50.470 --> 20:51.890]  The characters is like, oh, man.
[20:52.090 --> 20:52.250]  Yeah.
[20:53.230 --> 20:55.010]  That thing is really, uh...
[20:55.010 --> 20:57.470]  You know, I heard that it can get killed by ice.
[20:57.610 --> 20:57.790]  Yeah.
[20:58.050 --> 20:59.510]  It just has nothing to do with anything.
[20:59.990 --> 21:01.170]  Clearly, that's gonna come up again later.
[21:01.250 --> 21:02.850]  You're like, oh, okay, I guess that's it.
[21:02.990 --> 21:04.750]  Okay, all right, let's see what happens if you land on it.
[21:05.090 --> 21:06.710]  Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[21:07.450 --> 21:08.170]  Boom, baby!
[21:09.790 --> 21:11.190]  What did that do, though?
[21:13.150 --> 21:13.790]  I don't...
[21:13.790 --> 21:15.030]  Oh, 5 of 25?
[21:15.450 --> 21:18.010]  Oh, I mean, that's just...
[21:18.010 --> 21:19.570]  Those are just like the coins that you're getting.
[21:19.690 --> 21:20.690]  Maybe it gave you something.
[21:20.850 --> 21:22.610]  Wait, has that been there the whole time?
[21:22.690 --> 21:22.850]  Yes!
[21:22.850 --> 21:23.470]  I just noticed that.
[21:23.510 --> 21:24.210]  What are you talking about?
[21:24.610 --> 21:24.750]  Yes!
[21:25.930 --> 21:26.130]  Okay.
[21:27.350 --> 21:28.890]  I'll jump on this fucking thing.
[21:29.110 --> 21:29.570]  No problem.
[21:31.010 --> 21:31.250]  Whoa!
[21:31.530 --> 21:32.250]  Oh, shit.
[21:32.410 --> 21:32.730]  Oh, God.
[21:34.490 --> 21:35.230]  Oh, there you go.
[21:35.270 --> 21:35.590]  Oh, I gotta hold it.
[21:36.950 --> 21:38.390]  Oh, this is gonna be a nightmare.
[21:38.390 --> 21:39.610]  Oh, wow, this is gonna be a...
[21:39.610 --> 21:40.950]  This one might be tough.
[21:41.810 --> 21:43.230]  This one might be tough.
[21:43.230 --> 21:44.830]  Let's try to angle this.
[21:46.370 --> 21:47.450]  I believe in you, though.
[21:48.030 --> 21:48.470]  Camera...
[21:48.470 --> 21:48.550]  Uh-huh.
[21:49.350 --> 21:50.050]  And there you go.
[21:50.710 --> 21:51.030]  Boop!
[21:51.350 --> 21:52.990]  Well, at least I'm a good cook.
[21:53.430 --> 21:55.110]  Wait, did I just kill Remy?
[21:55.290 --> 21:55.910]  I think you died.
[21:56.690 --> 21:57.670]  I think you died.
[21:57.890 --> 21:59.290]  Oh, my God.
[21:59.570 --> 22:00.450]  At least you're still at 5.
[22:01.030 --> 22:02.790]  I say you just do this part.
[22:02.910 --> 22:04.510]  Let's see what's next if you beat this.
[22:05.370 --> 22:05.730]  Okay.
[22:06.690 --> 22:09.670]  Maybe they tell you, good enough, and they let you move on.
[22:15.610 --> 22:16.330]  Let's, uh...
[22:16.330 --> 22:16.930]  Oh, whoops!
[22:17.510 --> 22:19.350]  Uh, something must be wrong with that wood.
[22:20.650 --> 22:21.250]  Be careful, Remy.
[22:21.570 --> 22:21.910]  Okay.
[22:22.110 --> 22:24.030]  It looks like you're gonna need to make your own bed.
[22:24.030 --> 22:24.870]  See, there you go.
[22:24.930 --> 22:25.110]  Look.
[22:25.270 --> 22:26.470]  Wow, there she is just sleeping.
[22:26.950 --> 22:27.210]  Watch it.
[22:27.230 --> 22:27.710]  What's on TV?
[22:29.370 --> 22:30.330]  Ain't nothing on TV.
[22:30.490 --> 22:31.470]  She's just eating fucking nothing.
[22:32.410 --> 22:33.510]  It's also daylight out.
[22:34.750 --> 22:35.210]  Whip it.
[22:37.790 --> 22:38.450]  There we go.
[22:38.490 --> 22:38.850]  Hell yeah.
[22:40.070 --> 22:41.410]  See, we're learning about blue outlines.
[22:41.410 --> 22:44.710]  It'd be nice if the colors, like, represented one thing.
[22:44.770 --> 22:44.990]  Yeah.
[22:45.090 --> 22:46.630]  If we find out where we need to go next.
[22:47.310 --> 22:49.230]  Oh, shit, I can smell the coins.
[22:49.690 --> 22:50.890]  Well, that's like his thing, right?
[22:50.970 --> 22:52.010]  Like, he's got, like, a nose.
[22:52.890 --> 22:53.610]  I guess.
[22:54.050 --> 22:55.070]  Like, that's his, like, rat thing.
[22:55.090 --> 22:56.270]  These things are easy to use.
[22:57.130 --> 22:59.610]  Just jump on and go to town.
[22:59.790 --> 23:00.410]  Go to town.
[23:01.450 --> 23:02.790]  I love going to town.
[23:02.870 --> 23:04.410]  I love jumping on and I love going to town.
[23:04.550 --> 23:08.310]  With this kind of springboard, you gotta hold down your jump before you release.
[23:09.830 --> 23:10.230]  Yeah.
[23:10.550 --> 23:12.050]  Don't forget to hold down jump.
[23:13.810 --> 23:17.410]  I wanna watch, like, a romantic comedy where the character just says,
[23:17.670 --> 23:20.950]  Now we gotta break up in the third act, but very briefly.
[23:21.570 --> 23:24.010]  And then we'll come back together even stronger.
[23:26.530 --> 23:28.970]  Wow, they are just still showing this fucking rat, huh?
[23:30.650 --> 23:32.030]  There you go, it's finally you.
[23:32.050 --> 23:33.890]  Yeah, well, I mean, he's the comic relief.
[23:34.330 --> 23:34.530]  Yeah.
[23:34.630 --> 23:35.990]  Oh, shit, he's just bouncing.
[23:38.030 --> 23:38.830]  This is...
[23:39.810 --> 23:40.910]  There you go.
[23:41.270 --> 23:41.630]  Easy.
[23:41.930 --> 23:43.170]  You almost overshot it, man, that was crazy.
[23:43.630 --> 23:45.070]  Okay, now you gotta climb up that, I guess.
[23:45.130 --> 23:47.050]  Okay, well, I guess he's just gonna fucking show you.
[23:49.750 --> 23:51.710]  This really is Mario Sunshine.
[23:51.930 --> 23:52.410]  That's, ah, shit.
[23:52.810 --> 23:53.730]  Big time. Big time.
[23:58.790 --> 24:01.990]  I'm surprised that this character doesn't have a more famous voice.
[24:02.170 --> 24:04.570]  Yeah, I mean, that's...
[24:04.570 --> 24:06.450]  I'm sure it was in the movie, right?
[24:06.630 --> 24:07.730]  Like, what do you think his name is?
[24:11.270 --> 24:11.810]  Uh...
[24:11.810 --> 24:12.650]  Harold Ramess.
[24:14.870 --> 24:18.030]  Like, that level of fame, but not quite that.
[24:22.630 --> 24:23.710]  The frames.
[24:26.970 --> 24:32.530]  So you're gonna get some bugs and you're gonna shoot this poison at the bugs and kill all the bugs.
[24:33.810 --> 24:35.210]  Oh, they don't have you kill them.
[24:36.230 --> 24:37.410]  They can just sense trouble.
[24:37.730 --> 24:38.210]  Oh, definitely.
[24:39.070 --> 24:41.290]  Why would you throw the... I need the can!
[24:44.650 --> 24:46.450]  Get the fuck out of here, bugs.
[24:47.230 --> 24:49.550]  No. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Where you going? Where you going?
[24:51.550 --> 24:52.810]  Alright, I looked it up.
[24:53.870 --> 24:55.310]  This rat's name is Emil.
[24:55.850 --> 24:57.510]  And it is the same voice actor.
[24:58.690 --> 25:00.950]  Just a guy, his name's Peter Sohn.
[25:02.990 --> 25:05.670]  And when you Google it, people may ask,
[25:05.670 --> 25:07.150]  Who is older, Remy or Emil?
[25:07.950 --> 25:10.350]  And, uh, I'm not gonna bother to look at the answer.
[25:12.990 --> 25:15.190]  You know who would have been a great voice for this character?
[25:16.490 --> 25:17.370]  Brad Garrett.
[25:17.610 --> 25:18.910]  Brad Garrett's already in this movie.
[25:19.810 --> 25:21.190]  Brad Garrett's already in this movie.
[25:22.130 --> 25:22.630]  He is?
[25:22.730 --> 25:22.990]  Yeah.
[25:23.270 --> 25:24.430]  Who does Brad Garrett play?
[25:24.570 --> 25:28.810]  Uh, what's the... Gastonow? Is that the...
[25:28.810 --> 25:29.690]  I have no idea.
[25:31.630 --> 25:32.070]  Uh...
[25:33.290 --> 25:33.690]  Gusta?
[25:33.990 --> 25:37.650]  I said, who does he play, and then realized, like, I don't know any of these names.
[25:37.910 --> 25:38.750]  That's not gonna help me.
[25:42.950 --> 25:43.630]  What's in here?
[25:43.850 --> 25:45.490]  Oh, he's playing chess?
[25:47.150 --> 25:50.430]  Yeah, he's the, he's the, uh, he's the chef.
[25:52.470 --> 25:54.550]  Not, not, not Linguini the chef.
[25:54.690 --> 25:56.410]  The, he's like the dead chef guy.
[26:00.190 --> 26:01.370]  Brad Garrett's already in this.
[26:01.370 --> 26:03.530]  I was gonna say, Ratapult's cool.
[26:03.890 --> 26:08.070]  I was gonna say the guy who was, uh, Cliff in, uh, Cheers.
[26:09.250 --> 26:09.530]  Oh!
[26:09.890 --> 26:11.430]  That, that, that guy, you missed.
[26:11.770 --> 26:12.810]  Oh, God, he got flattened.
[26:13.150 --> 26:14.310]  You got fucking flattened.
[26:14.630 --> 26:15.810]  Give me that health.
[26:16.690 --> 26:17.910]  Let's try this again.
[26:18.050 --> 26:19.050]  Okay, I believe in you.
[26:20.390 --> 26:21.090]  It's easy.
[26:21.510 --> 26:23.910]  Oh, cool. Oh, good, I didn't consider that it was easy, that's great.
[26:25.290 --> 26:25.690]  Bam!
[26:26.410 --> 26:26.810]  Ratapult.
[26:27.230 --> 26:28.550]  I mean, it's a cinematic shot.
[26:28.610 --> 26:28.910]  Mm-hmm.
[26:29.190 --> 26:30.930]  I gotta hit a button, I think, to...
[26:30.930 --> 26:31.370]  There you go.
[26:31.490 --> 26:32.270]  Uh-oh!
[26:32.610 --> 26:32.990]  Lean, lean, lean!
[26:33.210 --> 26:34.870]  Oh, this is Tony Hawk!
[26:34.930 --> 26:35.610]  This is Tony Hawk.
[26:35.610 --> 26:35.870]  Ah!
[26:36.330 --> 26:37.030]  There you go.
[26:37.250 --> 26:38.450]  No, no, no, no, wait!
[26:40.350 --> 26:42.830]  I thought it would just automatically turn me.
[26:44.170 --> 26:44.690]  You fool.
[26:44.750 --> 26:45.390]  It did not.
[26:45.690 --> 26:46.170]  You fool.
[26:46.370 --> 26:47.810]  Okay, let's do this again.
[26:49.730 --> 26:50.170]  What?
[26:51.290 --> 26:51.730]  What?
[26:53.890 --> 26:54.330]  There.
[26:54.650 --> 26:55.690]  Jesus Christ.
[26:55.810 --> 26:56.210]  Ratapult.
[26:56.230 --> 26:56.530]  Okay.
[26:56.530 --> 26:56.590]  Okay.
[26:59.430 --> 27:01.650]  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[27:01.950 --> 27:03.510]  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[27:03.590 --> 27:05.870]  Okay, okay, so you have to get the other blue coin.
[27:06.950 --> 27:09.490]  But then there's... and then you gotta come back, because you gotta glide, baby.
[27:11.950 --> 27:12.270]  Fuck.
[27:12.410 --> 27:13.010]  Yeah, good luck.
[27:13.390 --> 27:14.170]  I believe in you.
[27:14.470 --> 27:15.150]  Oh, my God.
[27:16.270 --> 27:18.410]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
[27:18.550 --> 27:19.330]  Okay, you're good, you're good.
[27:19.450 --> 27:19.730]  You're good.
[27:19.750 --> 27:20.570]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[27:21.070 --> 27:21.690]  Where you going?
[27:22.110 --> 27:22.870]  Where you going?
[27:23.110 --> 27:23.730]  Okay, okay.
[27:23.790 --> 27:24.290]  I don't know!
[27:24.290 --> 27:24.850]  Turn, turn.
[27:24.890 --> 27:25.330]  I don't know!
[27:25.790 --> 27:26.330]  Okay, now turn.
[27:26.490 --> 27:26.810]  No!
[27:27.950 --> 27:29.930]  Okay, I gotta get some more rat health.
[27:30.150 --> 27:30.710]  It's behind you.
[27:30.790 --> 27:31.650]  There's health behind you.
[27:33.990 --> 27:35.530]  Behind the barrels on the left.
[27:36.730 --> 27:37.490]  Barrels on the left?
[27:37.550 --> 27:37.710]  Uh-huh.
[27:37.910 --> 27:38.530]  Keep going left.
[27:38.830 --> 27:39.750]  Oh, I need this.
[27:40.090 --> 27:40.450]  Oh, good.
[27:42.010 --> 27:43.290]  And there's health to your right.
[27:43.650 --> 27:44.150]  Health right there.
[27:44.170 --> 27:44.410]  In here?
[27:44.570 --> 27:44.930]  Yeah.
[27:45.490 --> 27:46.370]  Put that down.
[27:47.330 --> 27:47.990]  There you go.
[27:48.150 --> 27:48.470]  Okay.
[27:48.470 --> 27:48.610]  Okay.
[27:51.430 --> 27:54.950]  Take this chess piece in so we can win a game of chess.
[27:55.170 --> 27:55.410]  Oh, good.
[27:55.590 --> 27:57.810]  I hope it makes you put it in a position where you...
[27:57.810 --> 27:57.970]  The rat scammed it.
[27:58.110 --> 27:58.930]  Oh, it already.
[27:59.230 --> 27:59.510]  It, yep.
[27:59.750 --> 28:00.010]  I mean...
[28:00.010 --> 28:00.590]  Oh, it unlocks it.
[28:00.710 --> 28:00.890]  Yeah.
[28:02.210 --> 28:02.590]  Checkmate.
[28:03.670 --> 28:04.250]  Hell yeah.
[28:04.430 --> 28:07.070]  There you go, your 14th blue rat coin.
[28:07.950 --> 28:08.790]  Oh, beautiful.
[28:09.090 --> 28:09.470]  Uh-huh.
[28:10.250 --> 28:12.070]  What do you think the Snoop Dogg game is like?
[28:12.150 --> 28:13.470]  Do you think it's fun, or...
[28:14.650 --> 28:16.810]  Do you think it's better or worse than this?
[28:18.510 --> 28:19.510]  I bet you it's worse.
[28:19.750 --> 28:22.930]  I bet it is, but I bet that it's worse in a different way.
[28:23.150 --> 28:23.870]  Okay, here we go.
[28:23.970 --> 28:25.110]  Now we're locked in.
[28:25.410 --> 28:26.270]  Okay, now here we go.
[28:26.650 --> 28:27.270]  Now you're gonna go...
[28:27.270 --> 28:32.170]  Nope, yep, nope, nope, nope, yep, nope, right, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, left.
[28:32.310 --> 28:32.790]  Okay, nope.
[28:33.110 --> 28:33.710]  Okay, hang on.
[28:33.830 --> 28:34.530]  Nope, okay.
[28:34.650 --> 28:34.810]  Hang on.
[28:34.890 --> 28:35.070]  Okay.
[28:35.230 --> 28:36.350]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:36.490 --> 28:36.930]  Okay, okay.
[28:36.990 --> 28:37.550]  No, no, no, no.
[28:37.650 --> 28:37.870]  Okay.
[28:38.410 --> 28:40.850]  Nope, nope, nope, nope, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[28:40.870 --> 28:41.290]  Wait, I'm here.
[28:41.390 --> 28:41.510]  I'm here.
[28:41.510 --> 28:42.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:42.370 --> 28:45.810]  Okay, but now you gotta go back to the middle to glide down.
[28:46.330 --> 28:47.310]  Because you don't want to lose health.
[28:48.170 --> 28:48.850]  There you go.
[28:48.930 --> 28:49.330]  Look at that.
[28:49.410 --> 28:49.990]  So easy.
[28:50.250 --> 28:51.590]  This is fucking baby mode, dude.
[28:51.690 --> 28:52.870]  This is so easy for you.
[28:53.270 --> 28:54.710]  Do you know where I'm supposed to land?
[28:54.870 --> 28:55.410]  Glide to the umbrella.
[28:55.570 --> 28:56.350]  Pick up the umbrella.
[28:56.490 --> 28:57.610]  Press A to open and close.
[28:57.690 --> 28:58.570]  I think to the right.
[28:59.390 --> 29:00.170]  Look to your right.
[29:01.450 --> 29:02.350]  Oh, oh, down there.
[29:02.730 --> 29:03.470]  Just right down there.
[29:03.550 --> 29:03.870]  Look at that.
[29:04.890 --> 29:05.610]  Look at that.
[29:06.210 --> 29:06.990]  Right on to it.
[29:07.050 --> 29:07.210]  See?
[29:07.710 --> 29:08.370]  Boom, you got a coin.
[29:08.750 --> 29:10.050]  Look at, look at that.
[29:11.570 --> 29:11.890]  Okay.
[29:14.030 --> 29:14.350]  Uh...
[29:14.350 --> 29:15.210]  What's in here?
[29:15.990 --> 29:16.970]  Cans and stuff.
[29:18.910 --> 29:19.270]  Yeah.
[29:20.350 --> 29:21.650]  I thought there'd be something cool.
[29:22.010 --> 29:22.130]  No.
[29:22.850 --> 29:23.770]  Uh, go in the back of the truck.
[29:23.830 --> 29:27.330]  I think, uh, I think if you get that chili pepper that's over there to the...
[29:27.330 --> 29:27.450]  Yeah.
[29:27.850 --> 29:28.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:28.810 --> 29:30.610]  And then I think you, you take it up there.
[29:30.670 --> 29:33.530]  I bet there's stuff that you need the chili pepper for.
[29:33.830 --> 29:35.070]  Let's blow this truck up.
[29:35.170 --> 29:37.090]  That's what I'm talking about, baby.
[29:39.850 --> 29:40.590]  There you go.
[29:42.010 --> 29:43.250]  Tailwhip, tailwhip, tailwhip.
[29:43.390 --> 29:43.750]  There you go.
[29:43.750 --> 29:44.290]  There we go.
[29:45.230 --> 29:46.950]  I think I was too close to the pepper.
[29:48.330 --> 29:49.530]  Oh, shit.
[29:49.670 --> 29:50.150]  Yeah.
[29:52.430 --> 29:54.130]  Oh, more stink bugs.
[30:01.490 --> 30:05.310]  I am tired of the tutorial rat and I want him to go away.
[30:08.470 --> 30:12.270]  I think he is hilarious and only enhances this game.
[30:13.870 --> 30:14.830]  Comedy gold.
[30:15.310 --> 30:17.110]  Yeah, he's, uh, he's great, man.
[30:17.250 --> 30:17.970]  Yeah, you're getting up.
[30:22.710 --> 30:23.190]  Thanks.
[30:23.770 --> 30:24.170]  Okay.
[30:24.330 --> 30:24.950]  Thanks, tutorial rat.
[30:26.630 --> 30:28.430]  You didn't fucking... Andrew.
[30:28.870 --> 30:29.350]  Andrew!
[30:29.710 --> 30:29.930]  Whoops.
[30:30.150 --> 30:30.830]  Okay, okay.
[30:31.970 --> 30:32.530]  There you go.
[30:32.570 --> 30:32.950]  There we go.
[30:33.530 --> 30:33.730]  Okay.
[30:35.490 --> 30:37.070]  Pat, you are gonna die.
[30:37.150 --> 30:38.310]  You have one rat health.
[30:39.650 --> 30:41.110]  Yeah, there's a tomato somewhere.
[30:41.310 --> 30:41.850]  There's a...
[30:41.850 --> 30:44.590]  Oh, you can do something to the, uh...
[30:44.590 --> 30:44.970]  Yeah.
[30:45.650 --> 30:46.090]  Whip it.
[30:46.370 --> 30:46.550]  Nope.
[30:49.290 --> 30:50.090]  Can you do something?
[30:50.110 --> 30:50.930]  Can you hit the steering wheel?
[30:52.510 --> 30:53.610]  There you go.
[30:54.470 --> 30:55.370]  That's fun.
[30:56.930 --> 30:57.550]  Okay, well.
[30:58.770 --> 30:59.070]  Uh-oh.
[30:59.470 --> 31:00.150]  Uh-oh.
[31:00.330 --> 31:00.770]  Uh-oh.
[31:00.930 --> 31:01.410]  Uh-oh.
[31:02.690 --> 31:03.710]  Come on, radio.
[31:04.330 --> 31:04.990]  Can't do anything?
[31:05.150 --> 31:05.590]  That sucks.
[31:08.630 --> 31:10.290]  It's like a McDonald's play place.
[31:12.610 --> 31:14.590]  You'll end up exactly where you want to be.
[31:15.050 --> 31:15.810]  Cool, huh?
[31:17.150 --> 31:18.290]  Yeah, that's cool.
[31:19.090 --> 31:19.890]  So cool.
[31:21.970 --> 31:22.710]  Cool, huh?
[31:22.850 --> 31:23.230]  Yeah, man.
[31:23.370 --> 31:24.690]  Yeah, it's fucking...
[31:24.690 --> 31:25.190]  It's cool.
[31:26.590 --> 31:27.390]  Triple A!
[31:27.590 --> 31:28.710]  Let's see what you've got!
[31:32.200 --> 31:34.740]  Jump towards the highlight point and press B when directly above.
[31:34.860 --> 31:35.740]  Use the left stick.
[31:35.820 --> 31:36.020]  Okay.
[31:39.280 --> 31:43.260]  Now, I'm not advocating that we play this entire game, but how funny would that be?
[31:43.260 --> 31:43.720]  No, we are.
[31:43.920 --> 31:49.260]  I was going to say, how funny would that be if this was the complete guide?
[31:50.420 --> 31:51.780]  Here's a regulation gameplay.
[31:51.960 --> 31:53.760]  It's the complete guide to Ratatouille.
[31:53.760 --> 31:55.740]  We've got to unlock all the bonus content.
[31:58.280 --> 31:59.540]  Hey, what's going on, guys?
[31:59.640 --> 32:03.860]  Welcome to your complete guide to Ratatouille, the video game 2007.
[32:04.580 --> 32:06.120]  If you're like us...
[32:06.120 --> 32:07.100]  Oh, my God.
[32:08.200 --> 32:10.420]  If you're like us, true gamers,
[32:10.420 --> 32:15.780]  and you want to see how to get every unlockable in Ratatouille, the video game 2007,
[32:16.320 --> 32:17.480]  then you came to the right place.
[32:17.640 --> 32:19.420]  Andrew is going to guide you through...
[32:20.120 --> 32:21.460]  Do you think this is how they started Achievement Hunter?
[32:21.520 --> 32:22.260]  It was just like this?
[32:23.040 --> 32:23.640]  I think so.
[32:23.720 --> 32:26.760]  I think Ratty Boy and Ratatouille were their one-twos.
[32:28.420 --> 32:29.200]  Climb a pipe.
[32:30.180 --> 32:31.980]  You collected 20 charms.
[32:32.280 --> 32:33.040]  Now, find a meal.
[32:33.460 --> 32:34.320]  I don't want to.
[32:34.660 --> 32:34.980]  No.
[32:35.160 --> 32:35.740]  There's one.
[32:35.920 --> 32:37.480]  I got more charms to collect.
[32:37.720 --> 32:38.580]  There's more pipes.
[32:40.120 --> 32:40.580]  But...
[32:40.580 --> 32:41.520]  But before...
[32:41.520 --> 32:41.760]  Hang on.
[32:41.860 --> 32:42.860]  Before there's more pipes...
[32:42.860 --> 32:43.660]  Yeah, cross that.
[32:43.720 --> 32:43.980]  Definitely.
[32:44.140 --> 32:44.600]  100%.
[32:45.460 --> 32:45.920]  100%.
[32:46.740 --> 32:48.660]  Okay, there's a pipe there.
[32:49.080 --> 32:50.940]  Climb down the pipe to collect the charm.
[32:52.480 --> 32:53.740]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[32:53.840 --> 32:55.660]  And he goes down weird style.
[32:56.160 --> 32:57.120]  There you go.
[32:57.360 --> 32:58.660]  Take that, you stupid chickens.
[33:00.560 --> 33:02.860]  I'm afraid to leave the other stuff behind.
[33:03.160 --> 33:04.120]  First, I'm going to get this health.
[33:04.600 --> 33:05.260]  Give me that health.
[33:05.600 --> 33:06.220]  Get away, chickens.
[33:07.180 --> 33:07.640]  Okay.
[33:08.580 --> 33:10.940]  We also still don't know how to get that one.
[33:12.380 --> 33:14.440]  Maybe it's like I push B on it?
[33:15.040 --> 33:15.680]  Oh, there we go.
[33:15.900 --> 33:16.500]  There you go.
[33:18.380 --> 33:18.860]  Yep.
[33:19.620 --> 33:21.560]  I like the way he stands on the water.
[33:23.220 --> 33:24.440]  You can't take the shortcut.
[33:24.680 --> 33:24.920]  Sorry.
[33:26.380 --> 33:27.120]  There you go.
[33:28.920 --> 33:30.040]  Look at you.
[33:30.260 --> 33:30.440]  See?
[33:30.980 --> 33:35.800]  Now, without the guide, people would not have known to do that, Andrew.
[33:36.660 --> 33:38.140]  They would have no fucking idea.
[33:38.140 --> 33:40.240]  They'd be walking around going, how do I do this?
[33:40.360 --> 33:41.260]  How do I get up there?
[33:41.300 --> 33:43.220]  How do I get up there, they would be saying.
[33:43.340 --> 33:43.940]  But don't worry.
[33:44.180 --> 33:50.700]  You're watching Regulation Gameplay, where this is your complete guide to Ratatouille 2007.
[33:51.140 --> 33:53.920]  When I thought we were going to play the Snoop Dogg video game.
[33:55.300 --> 33:57.760]  It's very possible they paid for this.
[33:58.020 --> 34:01.780]  This is the type of quality content you get.
[34:03.860 --> 34:05.080]  Let's go up here.
[34:05.240 --> 34:06.900]  You might have paid for this.
[34:07.280 --> 34:08.000]  It's possible.
[34:08.160 --> 34:10.580]  Listen, we haven't figured things out while we recorded this.
[34:12.140 --> 34:13.860]  This may be behind the paywall, baby.
[34:14.240 --> 34:16.120]  Get those top Ratatouille fans.
[34:17.200 --> 34:17.580]  That's good.
[34:17.640 --> 34:19.980]  We got to get on the Ratatouille sub stacks and forums.
[34:20.520 --> 34:21.020]  Let them know.
[34:22.520 --> 34:24.100]  Oh yeah, you got to hit the water thing.
[34:24.280 --> 34:26.280]  Okay, you got to hit B to attach to it though, right?
[34:27.820 --> 34:28.540]  I think so.
[34:28.600 --> 34:30.580]  My move is I'm just not going to do anything.
[34:30.780 --> 34:31.100]  No, no, no.
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.540]  You got to hit B to attach to it.
[34:35.200 --> 34:35.560]  Wow.
[34:38.200 --> 34:40.760]  Yeah, I was trying to adjust my analog.
[34:40.900 --> 34:41.900]  I think it will get me there.
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.340]  I just need to push B or whatever.
[34:43.460 --> 34:44.140]  What the fuck?
[34:44.980 --> 34:45.460]  Okay.
[34:51.320 --> 34:52.400]  Oh my God.
[34:52.500 --> 34:52.900]  Yeah.
[34:53.340 --> 34:53.900]  You got it.
[34:54.140 --> 34:59.780]  Guys, that's why you pay the big bucks for this or you're getting it for free.
[35:00.200 --> 35:01.340]  Let us know in the comments.
[35:01.340 --> 35:01.380]  Either way.
[35:01.760 --> 35:04.220]  Let us know in the comments if you have any Ratatouille.
[35:04.300 --> 35:04.900]  Look out!
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.180]  That's Geoff's dog.
[35:08.320 --> 35:09.100]  Holy shit.
[35:09.100 --> 35:10.100]  That Artie?
[35:14.440 --> 35:16.220]  You think he's got a coin back there?
[35:16.440 --> 35:18.180]  Oh dude, he's going to kill you if you go back there.
[35:18.200 --> 35:19.420]  I don't think you're supposed to go back there yet.
[35:20.920 --> 35:21.340]  Oh my God.
[35:23.480 --> 35:24.540]  I'm missing one coin.
[35:24.940 --> 35:26.460]  Yeah, but it's got to be around here somewhere.
[35:26.580 --> 35:27.180]  It's just not there.
[35:31.870 --> 35:32.430]  There you go.
[35:33.370 --> 35:34.310]  What's up there?
[35:34.430 --> 35:35.690]  What's up to your left?
[35:37.330 --> 35:38.770]  I'll beat up this child first.
[35:38.870 --> 35:39.030]  Why?
[35:39.350 --> 35:40.170]  Oh my God.
[35:41.830 --> 35:42.150]  What?
[35:47.210 --> 35:48.130]  That was great.
[35:48.330 --> 35:48.510]  Okay.
[35:48.870 --> 35:49.710]  It's not up there to the right?
[35:49.770 --> 35:50.690]  I've never kicked a child.
[35:50.910 --> 35:52.390]  Look behind you.
[35:52.530 --> 35:52.730]  Up.
[35:52.950 --> 35:53.570]  Behind you.
[35:54.430 --> 35:54.750]  Up.
[35:55.390 --> 35:55.710]  In there?
[35:55.870 --> 35:56.550]  A little bit further.
[35:57.230 --> 35:58.070]  See that blue thing?
[35:58.230 --> 36:00.350]  A rat's got to do what a rat's got to do.
[36:00.510 --> 36:01.750]  A rat's got to do what a rat's got to do.
[36:01.910 --> 36:03.590]  Doesn't it feel like you should go up there somehow?
[36:05.110 --> 36:05.390]  You know what I mean?
[36:05.390 --> 36:05.850]  Yeah, it does.
[36:05.930 --> 36:06.110]  Yeah.
[36:06.470 --> 36:06.750]  Right.
[36:07.170 --> 36:07.490]  So...
[36:08.730 --> 36:09.050]  Uh...
[36:09.050 --> 36:09.410]  Okay.
[36:10.310 --> 36:10.930]  Nope, not that way.
[36:10.950 --> 36:11.610]  Can't go that way.
[36:11.770 --> 36:12.190]  Nuh-uh.
[36:13.530 --> 36:14.110]  I think we can blow up...
[36:14.110 --> 36:14.710]  Can you go up front?
[36:14.770 --> 36:16.370]  Can you go to the top of the thing?
[36:16.530 --> 36:16.870]  Like that?
[36:17.350 --> 36:18.050]  Like, yeah, this little...
[36:18.050 --> 36:19.110]  Yeah, let's do this.
[36:22.890 --> 36:23.890]  Oh, yeah, maybe...
[36:23.890 --> 36:24.550]  Can you, like, dash?
[36:25.030 --> 36:25.350]  Run?
[36:25.530 --> 36:25.770]  Jump?
[36:25.850 --> 36:26.050]  Something?
[36:27.210 --> 36:27.530]  Try.
[36:31.110 --> 36:31.430]  Help?
[36:31.910 --> 36:32.850]  Okay, maybe not.
[36:36.720 --> 36:38.520]  I mean, that does look like something, though.
[36:38.520 --> 36:38.820]  You're right.
[36:39.000 --> 36:39.400]  It does.
[36:39.500 --> 36:43.440]  And if it's not here, then I think it's over by the chessboard.
[36:44.780 --> 36:45.180]  Uh...
[36:45.180 --> 36:45.600]  Oh!
[36:46.000 --> 36:46.880]  No, we can't go that way.
[36:47.920 --> 36:49.340]  Yeah, doesn't that look like something?
[36:49.800 --> 36:50.780]  It looks...
[36:50.780 --> 36:51.940]  It absolutely does.
[36:52.040 --> 36:52.240]  Yeah.
[36:52.840 --> 36:53.240]  What?
[36:53.620 --> 36:54.000]  You...
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.020]  We have a little map...
[36:56.520 --> 36:57.300]  at the bottom.
[36:57.560 --> 36:58.460]  I don't know what those are, though.
[36:58.460 --> 36:58.680]  Oh, yeah.
[36:58.920 --> 36:59.780]  I don't know what those are.
[37:00.880 --> 37:01.920]  Let's just go to one.
[37:02.020 --> 37:02.560]  Let's see what happens.
[37:04.520 --> 37:04.920]  Okay.
[37:07.700 --> 37:08.500]  It's up...
[37:08.500 --> 37:09.720]  I feel like there's something here.
[37:10.620 --> 37:11.440]  Break these.
[37:13.420 --> 37:14.660]  Maybe it's down below?
[37:15.020 --> 37:16.620]  Like, inside where, like, the stink bugs were?
[37:19.480 --> 37:20.000]  Maybe?
[37:21.440 --> 37:21.960]  No?
[37:24.970 --> 37:25.470]  No?
[37:25.990 --> 37:26.230]  No?
[37:26.710 --> 37:27.150]  Huh.
[37:28.890 --> 37:31.150]  We need a guide for our guide.
[37:31.370 --> 37:32.490]  Do you think they ever did that?
[37:33.430 --> 37:33.870]  Oh!
[37:34.070 --> 37:34.970]  That's a good idea!
[37:35.290 --> 37:36.270]  Can I take this?
[37:36.270 --> 37:36.670]  Yeah!
[37:36.890 --> 37:37.790]  Now we're talking!
[37:38.570 --> 37:40.850]  And then go and see if you can, uh...
[37:41.590 --> 37:41.810]  Hoove.
[37:42.290 --> 37:42.690]  Yeah.
[37:43.250 --> 37:44.570]  I don't think this is gonna work.
[37:44.810 --> 37:45.210]  Shit!
[37:47.450 --> 37:47.850]  Uh...
[37:47.850 --> 37:49.250]  Oh, can you run over all the stink bugs?
[37:52.450 --> 37:53.310]  Oh my god!
[37:54.330 --> 37:55.950]  Guys, this is what you pay for.
[37:56.050 --> 37:58.770]  This is why we have this guide for Ratatouille.
[37:59.290 --> 38:00.510]  The Ratatouille missions.
[38:02.990 --> 38:03.650]  Fuck off.
[38:04.130 --> 38:04.850]  Take that!
[38:05.430 --> 38:06.350]  Alright, I think you got them all.
[38:07.110 --> 38:07.870]  Doesn't seem to matter.
[38:07.990 --> 38:08.730]  Yeah, I don't think that did anything.
[38:09.630 --> 38:09.950]  No.
[38:10.290 --> 38:11.390]  Okay, go over to...
[38:13.270 --> 38:13.870]  Oh, man.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.900]  I'm ready to take on Artie.
[38:20.140 --> 38:21.800]  Oh, you're gonna take this dog on?
[38:23.400 --> 38:23.720]  Fuck!
[38:23.900 --> 38:25.140]  Oh, I don't know about this now.
[38:27.880 --> 38:28.200]  Bitch!
[38:28.260 --> 38:29.180]  Oh my god!
[38:29.260 --> 38:30.640]  Being a great chef sure isn't easy.
[38:32.100 --> 38:33.580]  Oh, wow, he killed you immediately.
[38:33.940 --> 38:36.140]  Okay, hey, it put you back to where we needed to go, so this is good.
[38:36.320 --> 38:37.520]  Yeah, you know what, it's fine.
[38:37.520 --> 38:39.220]  It's a shortcut.
[38:39.260 --> 38:45.420]  Actually, actually, guys, that's a shortcut that we wanted to show you in this game.
[38:45.740 --> 38:48.720]  That if you ever get lost, just go get killed by the dog, and it's fine.
[38:49.640 --> 38:50.400]  There it is!
[38:53.060 --> 38:54.760]  You collected all 25, baby.
[38:55.700 --> 38:56.180]  Nice!
[39:01.180 --> 39:05.840]  Oh, I think he's gonna land on the table.
[39:06.500 --> 39:09.460]  Like, I think this is where we were going, like, oh, this looks like where we have to go.
[39:11.860 --> 39:12.500]  There you go.
[39:12.660 --> 39:13.240]  Good call.
[39:14.420 --> 39:14.740]  Ratapult!
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.460]  Here we go.
[39:22.460 --> 39:23.440]  That camera angle.
[39:23.520 --> 39:24.080]  That was pretty good.
[39:24.480 --> 39:25.380]  You've collected 20 charms?
[39:25.580 --> 39:25.860]  Yeah, okay.
[39:26.300 --> 39:27.100]  Isn't this Emil?
[39:27.480 --> 39:28.540]  Yes, yeah, he is.
[39:29.880 --> 39:31.080]  Yeah, so you just gotta go...
[39:31.080 --> 39:31.500]  Uh-oh.
[39:32.160 --> 39:32.800]  Oh, no!
[39:32.940 --> 39:33.460]  Uh-oh, careful.
[39:33.720 --> 39:35.720]  Okay, I think maybe it was too many polygons.
[39:35.840 --> 39:37.280]  With the leaf that was there.
[39:37.280 --> 39:39.340]  Yeah, I think the leaf touching the rope is too much.
[39:43.480 --> 39:45.380]  That's Brad Garrett's character.
[39:45.600 --> 39:46.500]  The big chef guy.
[39:47.660 --> 39:48.040]  Oh!
[39:51.980 --> 39:56.220]  I haven't seen Brad Garrett since Fargo, I want to say?
[39:56.440 --> 39:56.760]  Oh, yeah?
[39:57.040 --> 39:57.320]  Season 2?
[39:57.640 --> 39:57.880]  Uh-huh.
[39:58.160 --> 39:59.580]  You watch the Fargo show?
[39:59.780 --> 40:01.860]  No, I have not watched the Fargo show.
[40:02.300 --> 40:02.900]  It's very good.
[40:03.420 --> 40:04.580]  I hear good things.
[40:07.960 --> 40:09.020]  Uh-oh.
[40:15.050 --> 40:18.070]  Who the fuck is taking that cookbooks?
[40:23.020 --> 40:24.380]  Holy shit!
[40:26.660 --> 40:28.000]  Oh, my God!
[40:30.380 --> 40:31.060]  Whoa!
[40:31.840 --> 40:33.400]  Was she in the movie?
[40:33.840 --> 40:35.740]  Is this gonna be a boss fight?
[40:36.960 --> 40:39.040]  There's no way that this game has a boss fight.
[40:39.040 --> 40:39.760]  No!
[40:39.880 --> 40:41.440]  We have old lady vision!
[40:41.620 --> 40:42.220]  Pull the trigger.
[40:44.320 --> 40:45.240]  Oh, my God.
[40:46.240 --> 40:47.240]  Not to Artie!
[40:47.320 --> 40:47.740]  Oh, no!
[40:48.580 --> 40:50.120]  Oh, it is a boss fight!
[40:51.740 --> 40:51.820]  Run!
[40:52.540 --> 40:52.940]  Run!
[40:52.980 --> 40:53.980]  Ready, run, run, run!
[40:56.420 --> 40:56.820]  Okay.
[40:58.960 --> 41:01.460]  So, I bet you this is gonna be like Crash Bandicoot.
[41:01.780 --> 41:02.560]  Oh, yeah.
[41:02.840 --> 41:03.100]  Yep.
[41:03.260 --> 41:03.540]  All right.
[41:03.880 --> 41:04.720]  Let's do it.
[41:04.920 --> 41:05.720]  Go, Crash, go!
[41:05.920 --> 41:06.320]  Look out!
[41:07.740 --> 41:08.520]  Look out, Crash!
[41:09.380 --> 41:09.820]  Whoa!
[41:11.940 --> 41:15.460]  I actually like this version of Ratatouille a lot more than the movie.
[41:15.740 --> 41:19.460]  This is better than the rest of the game.
[41:20.960 --> 41:21.160]  Whoa!
[41:21.740 --> 41:22.180]  Uh-oh.
[41:23.260 --> 41:24.220]  Oh, my God.
[41:24.460 --> 41:24.840]  Look out!
[41:25.060 --> 41:25.220]  Okay.
[41:25.900 --> 41:26.180]  Whoa!
[41:29.060 --> 41:30.400]  You gotta get on those boards.
[41:30.780 --> 41:31.380]  You're losing ground.
[41:31.760 --> 41:31.820]  I'm not.
[41:31.960 --> 41:32.440]  I don't need them.
[41:32.580 --> 41:33.100]  Don't need them.
[41:33.320 --> 41:34.180]  I'm so far ahead.
[41:34.700 --> 41:35.020]  Jump!
[41:36.940 --> 41:38.700]  Why did I just go left?
[41:39.260 --> 41:40.760]  There's nothing next to the...
[41:40.760 --> 41:41.100]  Ow!
[41:43.580 --> 41:44.060]  Boards!
[41:44.180 --> 41:46.120]  Oh, now who's using the boards?
[41:46.280 --> 41:46.740]  I see.
[41:46.940 --> 41:47.500]  Yeah, you're right.
[41:47.540 --> 41:47.900]  You're right.
[41:47.920 --> 41:48.720]  You're right about the boards.
[41:49.020 --> 41:49.700]  You're right about the boards.
[41:50.520 --> 41:50.820]  Ooh.
[41:50.980 --> 41:51.620]  Oh, look out.
[41:52.500 --> 41:53.600]  What the fuck?
[41:53.640 --> 41:54.640]  Should've jumped on it!
[41:55.040 --> 41:55.400]  Jump!
[41:55.740 --> 41:56.160]  Ah!
[41:56.480 --> 41:56.900]  Ah!
[41:57.180 --> 41:57.600]  Jump!
[41:57.860 --> 41:58.580]  I'm trying!
[41:58.780 --> 41:59.460]  I'm trying!
[41:59.860 --> 42:01.020]  She's on my ass!
[42:01.180 --> 42:01.660]  Jump!
[42:01.800 --> 42:02.040]  Go!
[42:02.040 --> 42:02.820]  Ah!
[42:03.320 --> 42:03.540]  What?
[42:04.280 --> 42:04.840]  Jump boards!
[42:04.860 --> 42:05.380]  Jump boards!
[42:05.480 --> 42:05.700]  Boards!
[42:05.820 --> 42:05.980]  Boards!
[42:06.100 --> 42:06.140]  Boards!
[42:06.140 --> 42:06.300]  Boards!
[42:08.160 --> 42:08.560]  Flawless.
[42:08.840 --> 42:09.900]  Do a flawless run.
[42:11.660 --> 42:12.860]  How long is this?
[42:12.860 --> 42:13.520]  Oh, my God.
[42:13.960 --> 42:15.840]  That's what tripped you up, is a pebble?
[42:18.880 --> 42:19.820]  Oh, my God.
[42:20.080 --> 42:21.560]  Are you gonna have to platform this?
[42:22.720 --> 42:23.000]  No.
[42:23.040 --> 42:23.680]  Oh, thank God.
[42:25.120 --> 42:25.480]  Whoa.
[42:25.500 --> 42:25.860]  Oh, my God.
[42:25.880 --> 42:27.540]  How many shots in that shotgun, dude?
[42:27.560 --> 42:28.320]  That's crazy.
[42:29.220 --> 42:30.020]  That doesn't even look...
[42:30.020 --> 42:31.080]  I don't even think that's like a 22.
[42:31.080 --> 42:32.820]  Jeez, she's like pulling the trigger.
[42:32.920 --> 42:33.440]  I think...
[42:34.180 --> 42:36.700]  She actually is Anton Chigurh's mom.
[42:37.440 --> 42:39.000]  Oh, you collected a health container.
[42:39.900 --> 42:41.860]  You have more rat health.
[42:43.220 --> 42:44.500]  I upgraded my Remy.
[42:46.760 --> 42:47.000]  Okay.
[42:47.320 --> 42:48.280]  You just gotta collect more charms.
[42:48.300 --> 42:49.080]  I think we're done with the first level.
[42:49.300 --> 42:50.180]  Yeah, that's the first level.
[42:50.520 --> 42:51.540]  We can wrap up here.
[42:52.640 --> 42:55.160]  I gotta see what the second level looks like.
[42:55.880 --> 42:56.680]  Obviously, yeah.
[42:56.740 --> 42:58.680]  We gotta confirm we're in the next zone.
[42:58.740 --> 42:58.920]  Yeah.
[43:00.160 --> 43:01.920]  Man, loading screens sure are a thing.
[43:04.400 --> 43:06.680]  Oh, the simple life of the country.
[43:10.820 --> 43:12.620]  This looks like a nightmare.
[43:12.940 --> 43:13.060]  Yeah.
[43:18.730 --> 43:19.350]  Uh-oh.
[43:22.050 --> 43:23.430]  He really wants this book.
[43:24.390 --> 43:25.830]  He is really into it.
[43:25.870 --> 43:26.030]  Yeah.
[43:26.770 --> 43:28.570]  I didn't even know rats could read.
[43:28.790 --> 43:30.730]  Yeah, I mean, he's smart and he has like a nose
[43:30.730 --> 43:32.350]  and he likes sandwiches or something.
[43:32.470 --> 43:33.070]  There he is!
[43:35.190 --> 43:37.210]  He was actually killed by that old woman.
[43:37.370 --> 43:37.950]  Yeah, absolutely.
[43:38.450 --> 43:39.510]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:42.670 --> 43:43.390]  There you go.
[43:43.470 --> 43:43.850]  Brad Garrett.
[43:44.110 --> 43:45.110]  This is fake Brad Garrett?
[43:45.230 --> 43:45.510]  No, no.
[43:45.710 --> 43:46.670]  Brad Garrett did the voice.
[43:47.470 --> 43:49.070]  Oh, this is real Brad Garrett?
[43:49.130 --> 43:50.910]  I'm pretty sure Brad Garrett did the voice for this.
[43:53.190 --> 43:53.990]  That's insane.
[43:59.080 --> 43:59.700]  Let's see.
[43:59.940 --> 44:00.420]  Brad Garrett.
[44:01.120 --> 44:01.560]  Yep.
[44:02.080 --> 44:03.060]  Oh my God.
[44:04.060 --> 44:06.580]  Is this the only video game Brad Garrett has done?
[44:06.860 --> 44:07.300]  I don't know, maybe.
[44:07.580 --> 44:11.700]  Ian Skinner also did the voice for this.
[44:13.040 --> 44:14.640]  And he's Billbo.
[44:16.340 --> 44:17.200]  Oh, okay.
[44:17.320 --> 44:17.740]  From Lord of the Rings.
[44:18.240 --> 44:18.680]  Yeah.
[44:20.720 --> 44:24.240]  Do you think Disney was just giving money away at this time?
[44:24.320 --> 44:26.880]  At this time, yeah, with like video games and stuff.
[44:26.960 --> 44:27.780]  They just went, yeah, I don't care.
[44:27.900 --> 44:29.100]  Just fucking do the voice, you idiot.
[44:31.820 --> 44:32.900]  Yeah, here's my rate.
[44:32.980 --> 44:33.620]  Yeah, we'll double it.
[44:33.660 --> 44:34.420]  I don't give a fuck.
[44:44.070 --> 44:45.270]  Based on what?
[44:46.270 --> 44:47.150]  Like a ratapult?
[44:47.350 --> 44:47.730]  Like what?
[44:48.050 --> 44:48.930]  What qualification?
[44:49.250 --> 44:50.050]  I guess my nose.
[44:50.630 --> 44:50.830]  Yeah.
[44:51.850 --> 44:52.190]  Alright.
[44:52.430 --> 44:53.870]  This sounds definitely like level 2.
[44:54.130 --> 44:55.330]  Zero of a hundred?
[44:55.590 --> 44:55.970]  A hundred?
[44:55.990 --> 44:56.710]  Oh God.
[44:57.150 --> 44:58.070]  Oh no.
[44:59.390 --> 45:00.390]  We're gonna need a guide for this.
[45:00.390 --> 45:06.450]  Okay, so we can exit to main menu and then we gotta see what bonus stuff we unlocked.
[45:06.550 --> 45:07.290]  What can I tell ya?
[45:07.390 --> 45:08.390]  I love good food.
[45:09.430 --> 45:10.770]  Okay, I guess we can make stuff.
[45:10.770 --> 45:11.790]  Whoa, it's a minigame?
[45:12.990 --> 45:14.130]  To make food?
[45:14.330 --> 45:14.410]  I don't know.
[45:14.630 --> 45:14.970]  Okay.
[45:15.630 --> 45:16.970]  25 out of 525.
[45:17.650 --> 45:17.930]  Oh my God.
[45:20.290 --> 45:21.330]  There's side quests?
[45:21.390 --> 45:21.730]  Okay.
[45:21.950 --> 45:24.350]  Guys, this guide is gonna be insane.
[45:25.290 --> 45:26.530]  Okay, let's go back to main menu.
[45:26.630 --> 45:26.810]  Yep.
[45:27.870 --> 45:28.810]  Yeah, we saved.
[45:28.810 --> 45:29.050]  Yeah.
[45:29.150 --> 45:30.230]  Yeah, I think we should be good.
[45:31.470 --> 45:34.910]  Okay, so rat face icons unlock bonus material.
[45:35.110 --> 45:36.670]  We gotta see what bonus material we got.
[45:36.810 --> 45:38.870]  I think we unlocked something, right?
[45:39.690 --> 45:40.670]  We definitely did.
[45:40.770 --> 45:42.870]  We should probably end every episode checking out whatever the bonus material is.
[45:42.870 --> 45:43.610]  Oh, I like that.
[45:43.730 --> 45:44.850]  I think it's a very good idea.
[45:45.970 --> 45:47.530]  I believe anyone can cook.
[45:47.670 --> 45:49.110]  This is a two-player minigame?
[45:49.190 --> 45:49.890]  Oh my God.
[45:49.930 --> 45:51.710]  Eric, you gotta come to Nanaimo.
[45:51.910 --> 45:53.270]  We got a minigame to play.
[45:54.130 --> 45:55.090]  Yeah, that's what we need.
[45:55.110 --> 45:56.210]  That's what we need to do.
[45:56.670 --> 45:57.110]  That's right.
[45:57.270 --> 45:57.670]  Bonus.
[45:57.670 --> 45:57.990]  Yep.
[45:58.510 --> 45:59.290]  Okay, we already...
[45:59.290 --> 46:00.670]  Also, did you ever get a text?
[46:01.170 --> 46:02.810]  No, I never got a reply back.
[46:02.870 --> 46:03.390]  I'm still waiting.
[46:07.650 --> 46:08.450]  Bonus images!
[46:10.370 --> 46:11.170]  Concept art.
[46:11.950 --> 46:12.990]  Rat made escape boats.
[46:13.130 --> 46:14.870]  And those are the boats that they use.
[46:16.550 --> 46:16.950]  Honestly?
[46:18.070 --> 46:18.970]  Pretty nice art.
[46:19.130 --> 46:19.310]  Yeah.
[46:22.970 --> 46:23.670]  Like that.
[46:24.010 --> 46:25.190]  I wouldn't have that in my house.
[46:25.270 --> 46:26.810]  I would maybe have this on my wall.
[46:26.810 --> 46:29.550]  Oh, I would have rat escape boats on my wall.
[46:30.370 --> 46:31.910]  Yeah, that's pretty cool too, actually.
[46:32.090 --> 46:33.970]  I would put that on my wall, 100%.
[46:33.970 --> 46:34.750]  Okay, what's the last one?
[46:34.750 --> 46:38.310]  Oh, and then you see sort of completed Pixar concept art.
[46:39.150 --> 46:41.130]  It's a little different from the video game, you know what I mean?
[46:41.690 --> 46:42.370]  Is that all we got?
[46:42.470 --> 46:43.050]  I think so.
[46:43.850 --> 46:44.190]  Bonus.
[46:45.030 --> 46:45.710]  Oh my God.
[46:45.970 --> 46:46.530]  Oh my God.
[46:46.550 --> 46:49.570]  So 12 levels, 13 levels, 14 levels?
[46:50.290 --> 46:52.710]  Why do you keep saying it before you hit right?
[46:53.030 --> 46:54.590]  16, 17.
[46:54.590 --> 46:57.070]  How is this continuing to climb?
[46:58.170 --> 46:59.530]  Oh my God.
[47:00.130 --> 47:00.570]  21.
[47:01.230 --> 47:03.950]  There's no way this game has 21 levels.
[47:04.930 --> 47:06.430]  There's zero chance.
[47:06.590 --> 47:07.870]  What have you just gotten us into?
[47:08.850 --> 47:09.670]  I don't know.
[47:09.770 --> 47:11.510]  Can I look at a minigame really quickly just to see what this is?
[47:11.510 --> 47:12.270]  Yeah, let's do it.
[47:13.030 --> 47:14.110]  Let's just do a quick one.
[47:14.330 --> 47:15.750]  Oh, I get to pick my character.
[47:17.310 --> 47:19.690]  I mean, later you get to pick Selene, so that's pretty cool.
[47:20.190 --> 47:20.530]  Changes?
[47:20.730 --> 47:21.150]  What is changes?
[47:22.050 --> 47:23.990]  It's just deciding if you want somebody else.
[47:23.990 --> 47:24.190]  Okay.
[47:25.290 --> 47:28.950]  Oh, I think you have to have a two player.
[47:29.030 --> 47:30.190]  Like, there has to be a second player.
[47:30.510 --> 47:32.550]  Are there any other minigames that are single player?
[47:34.890 --> 47:36.430]  Okay, so that's your rat race.
[47:37.010 --> 47:37.730]  You already did that.
[47:39.070 --> 47:40.710]  Daring Dash is a one to two player.
[47:42.410 --> 47:44.990]  Okay, let's see what this is like.
[47:45.130 --> 47:45.950]  Let's go!
[47:46.310 --> 47:46.910]  Let's go, baby.
[47:48.390 --> 47:49.250]  Press Y while walking.
[47:49.730 --> 47:51.570]  There you go. That's a great tip.
[47:51.570 --> 47:54.130]  Now, I wonder if there are any unlockables within these.
[47:54.230 --> 47:55.950]  That's sort of why I wanted to look at it.
[47:56.130 --> 47:58.990]  Sort of like, maybe you can put a hat on them?
[47:59.170 --> 48:00.390]  Or different costumes?
[48:00.690 --> 48:02.290]  No, like maybe bonus content.
[48:03.050 --> 48:04.310]  Collect 20 stars.
[48:04.750 --> 48:05.150]  You ready?
[48:05.250 --> 48:06.310]  You got a minute.
[48:06.370 --> 48:06.730]  I'm ready.
[48:07.290 --> 48:08.510]  Alright, lock in. Go.
[48:09.590 --> 48:10.350]  Oh, wow.
[48:10.730 --> 48:11.490]  You are...
[48:11.490 --> 48:13.190]  Dude, you fucked this up so bad.
[48:13.350 --> 48:14.050]  You gotta go like...
[48:14.050 --> 48:14.790]  Where am I?
[48:14.790 --> 48:16.030]  You went up too fast.
[48:16.110 --> 48:18.050]  You gotta go left and right and hit the other ones.
[48:18.390 --> 48:19.990]  Yeah, you fucked this up.
[48:20.110 --> 48:20.150]  Oh, shit.
[48:20.150 --> 48:21.990]  Yeah, you fucked this up bad, dude.
[48:22.570 --> 48:23.550]  No, I got time.
[48:23.650 --> 48:24.150]  Oh, shit.
[48:25.550 --> 48:25.990]  Oh, my God.
[48:26.330 --> 48:26.690]  Why?
[48:26.950 --> 48:29.730]  I think what you have to do is like try to like stay in the middle.
[48:31.310 --> 48:31.770]  I see.
[48:31.950 --> 48:32.210]  Yeah.
[48:32.590 --> 48:37.030]  And like jump to get that one and then like go to like the left and get that one.
[48:37.090 --> 48:37.870]  And then jump this.
[48:38.470 --> 48:39.910]  Yeah, like stick to a side.
[48:40.170 --> 48:41.030]  Grab what you can.
[48:41.610 --> 48:42.930]  I'm gonna nail it next time.
[48:42.990 --> 48:43.470]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:43.470 --> 48:45.170]  I think you just have to be mindful about which way you go.
[48:45.170 --> 48:49.090]  I'm pretty sure this is where Fall Guys got their entire idea from.
[48:49.110 --> 48:49.290]  Oh, 100%.
[48:50.450 --> 48:52.370]  There's a definite lawsuit here.
[48:52.370 --> 48:56.310]  I think you could have gone down and grabbed one of those other ones when you were going up.
[48:56.490 --> 48:59.750]  Like, I think there's a world where you would have grabbed some of that stuff.
[48:59.830 --> 49:01.050]  Like, you gotta go back and get those.
[49:01.130 --> 49:02.090]  See, you missed two.
[49:03.030 --> 49:03.630]  You know what I mean?
[49:03.670 --> 49:04.770]  Like, you're missing a few.
[49:04.850 --> 49:05.350]  How many did you get?
[49:05.510 --> 49:05.830]  13?
[49:06.350 --> 49:10.010]  Hey, for a first timer, you know...
[49:10.010 --> 49:12.390]  Yeah, considering I wasted the first 30 seconds.
[49:12.490 --> 49:13.150]  Yeah, pretty much.
[49:13.370 --> 49:13.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:14.090 --> 49:14.670]  Alright, here we go.
[49:15.110 --> 49:16.070]  This is the last go.
[49:16.510 --> 49:17.410]  And then we gotta shut this down.
[49:17.610 --> 49:17.830]  Yep.
[49:18.230 --> 49:18.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:18.670 --> 49:19.310]  There you go.
[49:19.550 --> 49:20.130]  Get that last one.
[49:20.170 --> 49:20.630]  Get that last one.
[49:20.670 --> 49:21.190]  Get that last one.
[49:21.270 --> 49:22.430]  Okay, now pick a side and grab.
[49:22.950 --> 49:23.710]  Okay, now pick a side.
[49:23.790 --> 49:24.030]  Pick a side.
[49:24.030 --> 49:24.870]  Oh, there you go.
[49:25.690 --> 49:25.970]  Shit.
[49:26.290 --> 49:26.830]  No, you're alright.
[49:26.890 --> 49:27.190]  You're alright.
[49:27.290 --> 49:27.650]  You're alright.
[49:28.030 --> 49:28.430]  Other way.
[49:28.490 --> 49:28.750]  Other way.
[49:28.810 --> 49:29.070]  Other way.
[49:29.130 --> 49:29.610]  Not okay.
[49:29.630 --> 49:29.750]  Jump.
[49:29.810 --> 49:29.930]  Jump.
[49:30.010 --> 49:30.150]  Jump.
[49:30.230 --> 49:30.650]  There you go.
[49:30.690 --> 49:31.250]  You got that.
[49:31.530 --> 49:31.790]  Middle.
[49:31.990 --> 49:32.170]  Middle.
[49:32.350 --> 49:32.510]  Middle.
[49:32.750 --> 49:32.910]  Middle.
[49:33.070 --> 49:33.410]  There you go.
[49:34.030 --> 49:34.310]  Damn.
[49:34.310 --> 49:35.010]  You're alright.
[49:35.230 --> 49:35.790]  Here it comes.
[49:37.110 --> 49:37.470]  Boom.
[49:37.890 --> 49:38.570]  Okay, now pick a side.
[49:39.290 --> 49:39.730]  You got it.
[49:39.750 --> 49:40.230]  You're locked in.
[49:40.310 --> 49:40.790]  You're locked in.
[49:41.410 --> 49:41.550]  Up.
[49:42.050 --> 49:42.210]  Up.
[49:42.530 --> 49:43.230]  There you go.
[49:43.570 --> 49:44.250]  Grab that.
[49:44.810 --> 49:46.550]  Okay, now remember, they're gonna be right at...
[49:46.550 --> 49:46.990]  There you go.
[49:47.310 --> 49:47.670]  There it is.
[49:47.710 --> 49:48.050]  Go left.
[49:50.010 --> 49:51.710]  Oh, you're locked in right now, Andrew.
[49:53.710 --> 49:54.570]  Yeah, there you go.
[49:54.950 --> 49:55.290]  Good.
[49:55.790 --> 49:56.150]  Good.
[49:56.370 --> 49:56.810]  Now come back.
[49:56.850 --> 49:57.050]  Come back.
[49:57.090 --> 49:57.390]  Get that one.
[49:57.450 --> 49:57.770]  Get that one.
[49:57.810 --> 49:58.150]  There you go.
[49:58.210 --> 49:58.530]  And up.
[49:58.970 --> 49:59.930]  There you go.
[49:59.930 --> 49:59.990]  No.
[50:00.690 --> 50:01.590]  You only need four more.
[50:01.710 --> 50:02.230]  Three more.
[50:02.550 --> 50:03.230]  Three more.
[50:03.410 --> 50:03.510]  Come on.
[50:04.310 --> 50:04.710]  No.
[50:05.130 --> 50:05.210]  No.
[50:05.570 --> 50:06.430]  You need two more.
[50:06.510 --> 50:06.790]  Two more.
[50:06.870 --> 50:07.230]  Come back.
[50:08.230 --> 50:08.950]  No, they're gone.
[50:11.410 --> 50:11.810]  Last one.
[50:11.810 --> 50:12.170]  Let me get it.
[50:12.230 --> 50:12.570]  Let me get it.
[50:12.590 --> 50:12.930]  Yeah.
[50:13.030 --> 50:13.390]  Yeah.
[50:14.930 --> 50:16.390]  That's what I'm talking about.
[50:16.510 --> 50:17.090]  Hell yeah.
[50:18.330 --> 50:19.510]  That's how you get it done.
[50:20.370 --> 50:21.050]  Atta boy.
[50:22.650 --> 50:23.930]  Did we get anything for that?
[50:24.090 --> 50:24.930]  Fuck no.
[50:27.690 --> 50:30.510]  Time for games.
[50:30.690 --> 50:32.090]  Oh, but there's multiple stages.
[50:32.090 --> 50:32.950]  Oh my god.
[50:33.650 --> 50:36.450]  Okay, well, that's the it for now.
[50:36.530 --> 50:37.190]  Yeah, we did it.
[50:37.410 --> 50:41.530]  We'll be back with another chapter in the Ultimate Ratatouille Guide.
[50:41.670 --> 50:43.810]  Thanks for watching this.
[50:44.050 --> 50:46.490]  Let us know how your Ratatouille gameplay is going.
[50:46.870 --> 50:51.530]  Let us know in the comments what questions you have for any Ratatouille sort of bumps
[50:51.530 --> 50:52.650]  or hiccups you run into.
[50:53.090 --> 50:56.370]  Don't forget to listen to Regulation Podcast, which, if you're watching this right now,
[50:56.970 --> 50:59.510]  I can't imagine that you don't listen to the podcast.
[50:59.610 --> 51:01.350]  That just seems fucking crazy.
[51:02.130 --> 51:03.490]  So, what are you doing?
[51:04.690 --> 51:06.290]  Did you just guess in, like, a word?
[51:07.790 --> 51:09.770]  I mean, you can put whatever you want in here.
[51:09.970 --> 51:13.530]  I think you should put Regulation and, you know, see if that does anything.
[51:13.570 --> 51:14.010]  You know what I mean?
[51:15.130 --> 51:15.290]  Yeah.
[51:16.250 --> 51:17.510]  You continue wrapping up.
[51:17.670 --> 51:18.370]  Okay, oh, okay.
[51:18.590 --> 51:23.270]  So, if you like this, like the podcast, let a friend know about the podcast.
[51:23.270 --> 51:26.650]  Let a friend know about the guide that me and Andrew are making.
[51:27.010 --> 51:28.310]  I think it's too many letters.
[51:29.630 --> 51:32.210]  Let everyone know about what we're doing.
[51:32.490 --> 51:35.470]  No one else chose to join us for this gameplay today.
[51:35.990 --> 51:37.950]  Andrew did say, hey, we're doing this.
[51:38.050 --> 51:38.990]  Oh, just make it Regulate.
[51:39.590 --> 51:40.810]  That'll be fucking sick.
[51:41.070 --> 51:42.810]  Guys, and that is a Reg...
[51:42.810 --> 51:43.430]  That's a Reg...
[51:43.430 --> 51:44.310]  What? Cheat incorrect?
[51:44.690 --> 51:45.250]  What the fuck?
[51:45.590 --> 51:46.690]  What the fuck?
[51:47.130 --> 51:48.510]  What the fuck?
[51:49.450 --> 51:50.150]  All right.
[51:50.250 --> 51:51.470]  This is broken.
[51:51.470 --> 51:53.330]  Follow us and we'll see you next time.
[51:53.490 --> 51:54.210]  Thanks for watching.
[51:54.310 --> 51:54.690]  Bye.
[51:55.870 --> 51:56.310]  Begulate.
[51:56.510 --> 51:56.950]  Begulate.
