[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  Hello and welcome to another Ratatouille guide, part two,
[00:05.260 --> 00:08.800]  100%ing what the world needs in 2024.
[00:08.900 --> 00:11.440]  Well, we're we're we're hunting achievements.
[00:11.860 --> 00:15.640]  And however, whatever way you want to kind of parse that is up to you.
[00:15.740 --> 00:19.260]  We're providing you with a guide so that way you can 100%
[00:19.260 --> 00:20.940]  Ratatouille along with us.
[00:21.020 --> 00:24.320]  We hope that your part one went as well as ours did.
[00:24.380 --> 00:25.660]  And I'm ready for part two.
[00:25.860 --> 00:29.740]  This brand new level that we've only just seen a glimpse of
[00:30.660 --> 00:35.560]  and I am 100 and get some more bonus content
[00:35.560 --> 00:40.540]  because there's 21 bonus things in this fucking game.
[00:41.420 --> 00:43.520]  A mini mission beacon. What fun, Remy.
[00:43.620 --> 00:45.720]  Why don't you try a mini mission? Oh, my God.
[00:45.800 --> 00:47.640]  OK, a time challenge.
[00:47.760 --> 00:50.480]  Oh, my God. Challenges. Oh, no.
[00:50.720 --> 00:52.820]  OK, here you go. You got to you got to you got to chase them.
[00:55.440 --> 00:56.840]  OK. Oh, God.
[00:57.620 --> 00:59.000]  Jump. Let me spring. That was close.
[00:59.120 --> 01:00.960]  Why can't I swing? There you go. There you go. You got him.
[01:01.040 --> 01:02.080]  You got him. You got him.
[01:02.280 --> 01:03.500]  You just got to make sure you're on his tail.
[01:03.700 --> 01:05.960]  Yeah, just stay on his tail. Just stay on his tail. You got him.
[01:06.200 --> 01:10.100]  Oh, God. This is just this is just the rings in Superman 64.
[01:10.480 --> 01:12.500]  It is. 100%. This is terrible.
[01:12.820 --> 01:14.920]  All right. Wait, I have to get ready for this jump right here. Ready?
[01:15.760 --> 01:18.160]  Ready? Yeah. Bring it. Do it. Bam. Rats up. Go.
[01:18.240 --> 01:20.560]  Another one. Go. Got it. You got it. You got that green. Let's go.
[01:20.860 --> 01:23.340]  OK. Yeah. Easy, easy. OK. All right.
[01:23.380 --> 01:25.180]  You're good. You got it. Here we go. Here we go. No, no, we're good.
[01:25.180 --> 01:28.820]  We're good. Oh, what a shortcut. Up, up. Oh, shit. I got to climb.
[01:30.540 --> 01:32.700]  There you go. I hate that this is two minutes long.
[01:33.060 --> 01:36.120]  Oh, this is so much longer than it's so long. Oh, where'd he go?
[01:36.940 --> 01:39.140]  Oh, OK. He's up. It was to trick you. It was to trick you.
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.660]  He was trying to trick you. Yeah, I was trying to.
[01:40.700 --> 01:42.800]  Yeah, he was trying to make you a ghost. That would have really got me.
[01:42.860 --> 01:43.700]  Yeah, he's trying to make you a ghost.
[01:45.860 --> 01:48.140]  That's fucked up. Oh, shit. Oh, no.
[01:48.500 --> 01:51.180]  Oh, no. Oh, Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk. You got it.
[01:51.420 --> 01:52.180]  Yeah, you got it.
[01:53.080 --> 01:54.560]  This is actually relatively easy. OK.
[01:54.560 --> 01:58.240]  Oh, don't please don't say that right, right in the middle of it.
[01:58.580 --> 01:58.940]  Whoa.
[02:00.640 --> 02:01.180]  Oh, no.
[02:01.380 --> 02:03.880]  You son of a bitch.
[02:04.220 --> 02:06.100]  Oh, jump to the right. Jump to the right.
[02:06.280 --> 02:08.100]  Oh, no. Go back. Go, go back.
[02:08.120 --> 02:10.740]  Oh, my God. OK. OK. But we know where it is now.
[02:10.920 --> 02:12.300]  We know where the boat is. OK.
[02:12.620 --> 02:14.820]  Oh, OK. OK. We're OK. We're OK.
[02:14.880 --> 02:17.960]  You're OK. You got it. How fucking long are you?
[02:18.020 --> 02:19.660]  Almost there. Almost there. Doing...
[02:19.660 --> 02:21.320]  You got it. Hell yeah.
[02:21.680 --> 02:23.580]  Minigame unlocked. You collected ten charms.
[02:25.020 --> 02:26.840]  That's a book. That's stink bugs.
[02:28.640 --> 02:30.120]  OK. Is the book good?
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.040]  Soupy assistance. Would you like to start this?
[02:33.120 --> 02:34.760]  What the fuck is going on?
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.920]  I don't know.
[02:37.200 --> 02:38.900]  I guess these are side quests.
[02:40.760 --> 02:43.280]  Yeah, well, we need them to 100% the game, right?
[02:43.860 --> 02:44.260]  So...
[02:44.260 --> 02:46.120]  We do, yeah. I mean, they're giving us coins.
[02:46.380 --> 02:47.120]  So it's mandatory.
[02:47.440 --> 02:50.580]  Oh, this is real dumb.
[02:51.460 --> 02:52.640]  OK. Walking in a snail's face.
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.060]  OK.
[02:54.480 --> 02:56.880]  The soup is terrible. Use the spices to fix the soup.
[02:57.160 --> 02:57.360]  OK.
[02:58.040 --> 03:01.060]  Knock the cheese that is on the top shelf into the bucket below.
[03:02.160 --> 03:03.900]  OK. Oh, I can't be seen.
[03:04.060 --> 03:05.080]  It's a stealth mission.
[03:05.320 --> 03:09.140]  Oh my god. This is like...
[03:09.140 --> 03:10.600]  Snake eater.
[03:11.800 --> 03:12.500]  You got it.
[03:14.100 --> 03:14.840]  What am I...
[03:16.900 --> 03:18.020]  Just, you can't be seen.
[03:18.540 --> 03:20.840]  You just have to make sure you put the cheese in the soup.
[03:20.840 --> 03:21.580]  Or something.
[03:25.240 --> 03:25.600]  OK.
[03:31.270 --> 03:31.990]  Oh, OK.
[03:34.090 --> 03:36.250]  Isn't he my friend? Why would he be mad that I'm up here?
[03:36.250 --> 03:37.370]  Because he...
[03:38.310 --> 03:40.190]  Oh, there you go. There's the timer.
[03:40.310 --> 03:41.710]  I think that's to distract him.
[03:41.990 --> 03:44.330]  So you can get more...
[03:44.330 --> 03:45.650]  Well, that's not the right way.
[03:45.670 --> 03:46.850]  That's not the right way.
[03:47.710 --> 03:49.010]  You got to go back up.
[03:49.510 --> 03:49.990]  There you go.
[03:49.990 --> 03:51.370]  Uh-oh, you're in a sticky situation.
[03:51.470 --> 03:53.230]  But guys, that's how you get that achievement.
[03:53.390 --> 03:56.070]  That's how you get the cheevo for sticky situation.
[03:57.310 --> 03:59.430]  We want to make sure you're able to see all this.
[03:59.530 --> 04:00.790]  Get all these pieces, you know.
[04:01.390 --> 04:02.850]  Uh-oh. Get to the hidey hole.
[04:03.210 --> 04:04.070]  Hidey hole. Hidey hole.
[04:05.590 --> 04:06.330]  In there, in there.
[04:07.710 --> 04:09.170]  There you go. OK, good.
[04:09.430 --> 04:09.790]  Whoa!
[04:10.570 --> 04:13.170]  Holy shit! I thought he was my friend.
[04:13.210 --> 04:13.770]  Yeah, me too.
[04:14.790 --> 04:16.130]  This camera angle is very funny.
[04:16.130 --> 04:17.630]  I really like the framing.
[04:17.810 --> 04:18.930]  Look at this fucking rat.
[04:19.450 --> 04:20.930]  Oh no, a hidey hole!
[04:21.590 --> 04:22.030]  Wow!
[04:23.610 --> 04:25.030]  How many knives do they have?
[04:25.090 --> 04:26.870]  That's a lot. That's maybe too many.
[04:27.350 --> 04:31.530]  OK, how do we...
[04:31.530 --> 04:33.730]  OK, let's do this again.
[04:33.870 --> 04:34.530]  Hit the timer.
[04:34.910 --> 04:36.870]  Oh, this is good. I thought we were timed.
[04:37.410 --> 04:39.590]  So it was like sneaking, but like going fast.
[04:39.650 --> 04:40.090]  You know what I mean?
[04:40.150 --> 04:40.870]  We're good.
[04:41.570 --> 04:43.330]  OK, now hit it. Go!
[04:43.830 --> 04:45.070]  No, I gotta go get this.
[04:45.850 --> 04:47.710]  So you gotta pick this up, and you gotta drag it.
[04:47.710 --> 04:49.250]  OK, you gotta pick it up, put it across. You're good.
[04:49.610 --> 04:51.330]  Keep moving, keep moving. You just gotta wait for him.
[04:51.550 --> 04:52.830]  I think I gotta go... yeah.
[04:52.970 --> 04:54.890]  I think you gotta put it back over on that tray.
[04:55.230 --> 04:56.150]  OK, you're in the clear.
[04:57.470 --> 04:58.930]  Gotta make that move. Alright, here you go.
[04:59.450 --> 05:01.250]  Rat time, baby. Let's go. Let's fucking go.
[05:02.370 --> 05:03.290]  Boom. That's two.
[05:04.210 --> 05:05.370]  And don't forget, guys.
[05:05.530 --> 05:07.190]  Sticky situation is the only place
[05:07.190 --> 05:08.710]  where you're gonna get sticky situations.
[05:08.710 --> 05:11.130]  So make sure you don't lose out on that
[05:11.130 --> 05:12.630]  when you're in the middle of this side mission.
[05:12.750 --> 05:13.610]  Can you climb on that?
[05:14.530 --> 05:14.930]  Yeah.
[05:15.730 --> 05:16.690]  Yeah, I guess. OK.
[05:17.910 --> 05:20.490]  Yeah, the way this game works.
[05:20.910 --> 05:22.090]  There you go. Walk across.
[05:22.290 --> 05:23.530]  Oh no!
[05:24.810 --> 05:25.770]  OK, we're good.
[05:26.850 --> 05:28.350]  What is that? Oh, this isn't that bad.
[05:28.770 --> 05:29.830]  Cream? Milk.
[05:30.430 --> 05:31.710]  Uh-oh. Is that good?
[05:32.570 --> 05:33.810]  Oh yeah, because you're adding stuff.
[05:34.210 --> 05:37.070]  Can you tail whip this? Oh no, maybe not the sink.
[05:37.070 --> 05:38.250]  You gotta go all the way across.
[05:39.810 --> 05:41.390]  Oh wait, you are getting...
[05:41.390 --> 05:42.870]  Oh, the hidey hole. OK, you're good.
[05:43.370 --> 05:43.950]  You got it.
[05:45.310 --> 05:47.230]  OK, you gotta go all the way across it.
[05:48.710 --> 05:49.290]  Yeah, it looked like
[05:49.290 --> 05:51.150]  there was a coin. I'm trying to get the camera to
[05:51.670 --> 05:53.130]  see that. Yeah, it's over there.
[05:53.290 --> 05:55.630]  Oh no, I... I think it's a coin
[05:55.630 --> 05:57.510]  and it's like the last thing that you need.
[05:57.590 --> 05:59.030]  You just have to get over there.
[05:59.210 --> 05:59.730]  But how?
[06:01.470 --> 06:02.350]  Yeah, that's good.
[06:02.970 --> 06:04.770]  Guys, and this is the thing that you're gonna want to do.
[06:04.770 --> 06:06.850]  This is RNG based, so you want to make sure
[06:06.850 --> 06:08.990]  that you're hitting those
[06:08.990 --> 06:10.210]  things that are gonna reset
[06:10.870 --> 06:12.870]  what you need and the way that you are
[06:12.870 --> 06:14.850]  gonna get over there. Just like
[06:14.850 --> 06:16.730]  this. Boom.
[06:18.230 --> 06:18.810]  Oh no!
[06:18.970 --> 06:21.110]  I broke it! Where did it go? Oh, you have to pick it up.
[06:21.590 --> 06:22.510]  Oh, there you go. Get that coin.
[06:22.930 --> 06:23.950]  There you go.
[06:24.670 --> 06:26.990]  Very important to grab that coin. Now you pick that up
[06:26.990 --> 06:28.130]  but now you have to be careful
[06:29.290 --> 06:31.390]  because you're gonna have to sneak back that way.
[06:31.590 --> 06:33.190]  He's gonna turn naturally, right?
[06:33.190 --> 06:34.010]  I would think so.
[06:34.450 --> 06:37.150]  Yeah, okay, so you gotta get over there
[06:37.150 --> 06:39.490]  right now. And then when he turns, I think that's
[06:39.490 --> 06:39.930]  your cue.
[06:41.150 --> 06:41.390]  Now.
[06:43.270 --> 06:44.130]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, go, go.
[06:45.410 --> 06:47.050]  Oh no! You went the long way!
[06:47.650 --> 06:49.190]  I'm trying to get over!
[06:49.410 --> 06:50.590]  Okay, careful, careful, careful.
[06:50.890 --> 06:53.210]  You got it. You're in business.
[06:53.350 --> 06:53.710]  You got it.
[06:54.950 --> 06:56.090]  You got it. That's it.
[06:56.750 --> 06:58.990]  Yeah! You helped him make the soup
[06:58.990 --> 07:00.830]  even though he tried to fucking kill you, dude.
[07:04.240 --> 07:04.640]  Awesome.
[07:04.760 --> 07:05.880]  This is very confusing.
[07:06.140 --> 07:07.880]  Yeah, I don't really understand what we're doing.
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.080]  These percentages.
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.660]  I don't understand. Did I get everything?
[07:11.980 --> 07:14.280]  Yeah, I'm as confused as a rat in a kitchen.
[07:14.580 --> 07:16.060]  I just don't really know what's happening.
[07:18.560 --> 07:20.540]  I did not expect us to have minigames.
[07:20.960 --> 07:22.560]  No, I figured it was just
[07:22.560 --> 07:24.400]  gonna be, um...
[07:25.320 --> 07:26.820]  I figured it was just gonna be
[07:26.820 --> 07:28.400]  pretty straight. I just didn't think...
[07:29.100 --> 07:30.500]  Like, yeah, help him make
[07:30.500 --> 07:31.900]  the soup. Don't die. Oh, okay.
[07:32.800 --> 07:33.140]  What?
[07:35.400 --> 07:36.440]  The fuck's going on?
[07:37.160 --> 07:38.640]  Just put me back where I was.
[07:39.720 --> 07:40.500]  Yeah, I just wanna
[07:40.500 --> 07:42.480]  go back to...
[07:42.480 --> 07:43.760]  Wait, why are you here now?
[07:45.440 --> 07:46.460]  I wanna go
[07:46.460 --> 07:47.600]  back to where I was.
[07:48.500 --> 07:50.340]  Did you beat the level? What happened?
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.540]  There's no way that was
[07:52.540 --> 07:53.780]  the level. What happened?
[08:00.070 --> 08:00.870]  That's Brian Denny.
[08:00.870 --> 08:01.390]  That's Brian Denny.
[08:05.650 --> 08:07.650]  I don't care what...
[08:08.640 --> 08:09.570]  Take me back!
[08:11.670 --> 08:12.690]  There's no way
[08:12.690 --> 08:14.190]  that this is like a hub game, right?
[08:14.330 --> 08:16.030]  Where, like, I go to different levels?
[08:16.410 --> 08:17.730]  That would be crazy.
[08:18.930 --> 08:20.410]  That would be absolutely crazy.
[08:20.870 --> 08:22.170]  It would be insane.
[08:23.510 --> 08:23.950]  Oh.
[08:24.110 --> 08:25.370]  Oh, no.
[08:27.110 --> 08:28.470]  Where am I?
[08:28.470 --> 08:29.310]  That's always a good question.
[08:29.490 --> 08:30.730]  Are you on the same level?
[08:32.290 --> 08:33.450]  No, I'm not.
[08:33.510 --> 08:34.910]  Because I had a coin before.
[08:35.190 --> 08:35.570]  Yeah.
[08:39.070 --> 08:40.030]  Can I...
[08:40.030 --> 08:41.810]  Do we have to exit to the main menu?
[08:42.390 --> 08:43.090]  Mission status.
[08:43.330 --> 08:44.530]  I don't...
[08:45.870 --> 08:46.350]  Uh...
[08:48.230 --> 08:50.310]  Oh, this game.
[08:50.350 --> 08:51.190]  Oh, my God.
[08:52.410 --> 08:53.290]  Yeah, okay.
[08:53.330 --> 08:53.930]  Let's go back.
[08:53.930 --> 08:54.190]  Okay.
[08:55.070 --> 08:56.990]  I don't know if this game has a level select.
[08:57.130 --> 08:57.810]  We might be in trouble.
[08:57.990 --> 08:58.810]  Oh, no.
[09:01.710 --> 09:02.590]  Oh, no!
[09:04.930 --> 09:05.810]  Oh, no!
[09:07.270 --> 09:07.710]  Well,
[09:08.230 --> 09:10.270]  guys, this is what you don't do
[09:10.270 --> 09:12.030]  if you're trying to 100%
[09:12.830 --> 09:13.270]  Ratatouille.
[09:14.870 --> 09:15.690]  Uh, yep.
[09:16.890 --> 09:17.990]  We're just gonna...
[09:17.990 --> 09:19.310]  There's no way.
[09:19.470 --> 09:21.910]  There's no way that that was a whole level.
[09:23.930 --> 09:24.750]  We're going back.
[09:25.050 --> 09:26.910]  We're gonna end up going back there.
[09:27.070 --> 09:28.550]  We're just gonna continue here.
[09:29.590 --> 09:31.670]  This is insane.
[09:32.990 --> 09:33.910]  Wait, you gotta grab
[09:33.910 --> 09:34.850]  those coins down here, man.
[09:35.870 --> 09:37.910]  We have to collect 100
[09:37.910 --> 09:38.850]  of them.
[09:40.730 --> 09:41.270]  Okay.
[09:42.430 --> 09:43.550]  Oh, my God.
[09:45.510 --> 09:46.050]  Okay.
[09:47.510 --> 09:49.130]  What is the important item here?
[09:54.210 --> 09:54.610]  Oh, my God.
[09:54.610 --> 09:55.030]  Shut up,
[09:55.250 --> 09:56.530]  you dead chef.
[09:58.530 --> 09:59.550]  Oh, my God.
[09:59.650 --> 09:59.950]  Okay.
[10:00.750 --> 10:01.950]  Oh, my God.
[10:02.330 --> 10:04.330]  Can I get up there? How do I get up here?
[10:05.170 --> 10:06.330]  It's gotta be a different way.
[10:06.970 --> 10:08.650]  I think you gotta keep exploring
[10:08.650 --> 10:09.610]  and we'll get up there eventually.
[10:11.110 --> 10:12.750]  Unless you accidentally beat the level,
[10:12.950 --> 10:14.370]  then you did it wrong. You know what I mean?
[10:15.670 --> 10:16.070]  Yeah.
[10:16.070 --> 10:16.230]  Yeah.
[10:17.190 --> 10:18.650]  Oh, man.
[10:20.330 --> 10:22.010]  Andrew, we're on video two
[10:22.010 --> 10:23.990]  and our plan has already fallen apart.
[10:24.750 --> 10:25.310]  No.
[10:27.190 --> 10:28.150]  Are you
[10:28.150 --> 10:29.510]  gonna take me to the next level?
[10:29.950 --> 10:32.190]  If so, let me know
[10:32.190 --> 10:33.250]  ahead of time.
[10:33.410 --> 10:34.270]  Walk over to the green coin.
[10:35.570 --> 10:36.130]  Yeah!
[10:37.590 --> 10:38.150]  Yes!
[10:40.790 --> 10:41.350]  Wait.
[10:41.770 --> 10:42.990]  Hang on. Wait, what?
[10:48.610 --> 10:50.410]  These are things you have to do
[10:50.410 --> 10:51.730]  in that level, right?
[10:51.930 --> 10:52.230]  Okay.
[10:52.670 --> 10:54.530]  I believe so.
[10:54.530 --> 10:55.450]  Would you like a guess?
[10:55.570 --> 10:56.770]  Hell yeah, guys.
[10:57.310 --> 10:58.930]  This game is a hope game.
[10:59.130 --> 11:01.930]  If you get lost in this game,
[11:02.250 --> 11:03.730]  what you do is
[11:03.730 --> 11:05.330]  you just watch this guide,
[11:05.430 --> 11:06.550]  you show your friends,
[11:07.390 --> 11:09.650]  and now you guys can 100%
[11:09.650 --> 11:10.890]  Ratatouille just like us.
[11:11.030 --> 11:11.870]  Oh, hell yeah.
[11:11.870 --> 11:13.410]  Okay. Perfect.
[11:14.930 --> 11:15.770]  You already did this.
[11:16.430 --> 11:17.390]  Yeah, please don't do it again.
[11:18.550 --> 11:19.850]  No, I was hoping that they would put
[11:19.850 --> 11:20.970]  like a percentage on it.
[11:21.690 --> 11:23.250]  No, I don't like that.
[11:23.250 --> 11:25.070]  So, I guess we gotta collect these coins
[11:25.070 --> 11:26.690]  and we have to make sure we go get that bonus.
[11:28.070 --> 11:28.390]  Yeah.
[11:29.090 --> 11:30.670]  I mean, that was the thing that was killing me
[11:30.670 --> 11:32.050]  is that we knew where the bonus coin was
[11:32.050 --> 11:33.710]  and we couldn't get it, you know?
[11:35.410 --> 11:37.990]  You have to hit the grab button
[11:37.990 --> 11:38.410]  or whatever.
[11:38.410 --> 11:40.050]  That's fine. Yeah.
[11:40.650 --> 11:42.050]  What's this? This is a blue thing.
[11:42.830 --> 11:44.510]  This is taking us somewhere else too.
[11:44.690 --> 11:45.610]  Left and right is inverted.
[11:46.030 --> 11:47.170]  Cutting board calamity.
[11:47.690 --> 11:50.850]  This game is currently locked. You need 50 charms to unlock it.
[11:50.970 --> 11:52.310]  Wow. Oh my god.
[11:53.190 --> 11:53.490]  Okay.
[11:55.730 --> 11:56.990]  Let's go through here.
[11:57.110 --> 11:58.770]  I think this rat should be in Smash Bros.
[11:58.890 --> 12:01.150]  They already have like character models.
[12:01.430 --> 12:02.090]  You know what I mean?
[12:02.150 --> 12:03.270]  He's got a tail whip.
[12:03.750 --> 12:06.650]  He has moves. They have all like the voice acting lines.
[12:06.650 --> 12:09.250]  He can call in Brian Denny to come help.
[12:10.770 --> 12:11.290]  Okay.
[12:11.470 --> 12:13.250]  I think you gotta jump on that.
[12:13.790 --> 12:14.510]  There you go.
[12:14.610 --> 12:15.570]  And then the next one.
[12:16.090 --> 12:17.410]  Oh, look at you.
[12:18.090 --> 12:19.450]  What a champion, baby.
[12:20.790 --> 12:22.730]  I don't think Nintendo has a rat, do they?
[12:22.850 --> 12:24.690]  No, I don't think so.
[12:24.770 --> 12:26.070]  I mean, there's like
[12:26.510 --> 12:28.370]  a mouse villain character
[12:28.370 --> 12:30.350]  in Super Mario Bros. 2
[12:30.350 --> 12:32.710]  for like the NES, but that's really it.
[12:33.270 --> 12:33.590]  You know?
[12:34.430 --> 12:35.870]  Let's climb this.
[12:38.030 --> 12:39.710]  I had my world
[12:39.710 --> 12:41.890]  devastated, Eric.
[12:42.350 --> 12:42.950]  Shocked.
[12:43.730 --> 12:45.090]  I could not believe
[12:45.090 --> 12:47.590]  that Dominic
[12:48.310 --> 12:50.010]  and Rhea are not a real couple.
[12:50.230 --> 12:51.150]  Oh, did you not know that?
[12:51.630 --> 12:53.770]  I had no idea until like yesterday.
[12:54.030 --> 12:54.430]  Oh, that's funny.
[12:54.670 --> 12:56.510]  What a weird thing.
[12:56.730 --> 12:58.530]  I think Dominic just got married.
[12:58.810 --> 13:00.810]  We're talking about WWE professional wrestlers.
[13:00.810 --> 13:02.410]  I think Dominic Mysterio
[13:02.410 --> 13:04.630]  just got married
[13:04.630 --> 13:06.490]  to his high school girlfriend.
[13:07.370 --> 13:08.230]  That's crazy.
[13:08.290 --> 13:09.330]  They've been together for a really long time.
[13:11.190 --> 13:12.850]  He has not been
[13:12.850 --> 13:14.830]  wrestling for very long, but he's doing a very good job.
[13:14.970 --> 13:15.790]  He's a lot of fun to watch.
[13:17.290 --> 13:17.710]  The fuck?
[13:18.750 --> 13:20.170]  Take that, luxury!
[13:20.590 --> 13:20.790]  Wait.
[13:22.310 --> 13:23.810]  Is that how cars work?
[13:23.850 --> 13:24.330]  Oh, yeah.
[13:27.550 --> 13:28.030]  Okay.
[13:29.770 --> 13:30.170]  Uh...
[13:30.170 --> 13:31.950]  What's great about this game is you can unlock
[13:31.950 --> 13:33.690]  things you didn't even know you needed to unlock.
[13:34.010 --> 13:35.770]  You have no idea, and you go,
[13:35.890 --> 13:37.730]  oh, that's a future thing.
[13:37.870 --> 13:38.710]  It's already solved.
[13:38.850 --> 13:42.490]  How did you find out that they weren't a couple in real life?
[13:44.230 --> 13:45.830]  I think I saw a clip
[13:45.830 --> 13:48.070]  where she was talking about her
[13:48.070 --> 13:50.010]  partner being an AW
[13:50.010 --> 13:50.930]  and I was like, what?
[13:52.530 --> 13:53.550]  He's a professional wrestler.
[13:53.670 --> 13:54.290]  They're both Australian.
[13:55.190 --> 13:56.030]  I think
[13:56.030 --> 13:58.490]  I just assumed after...
[13:58.490 --> 13:58.890]  Oh!
[13:59.110 --> 13:59.870]  Okay.
[14:02.310 --> 14:03.510]  There we go.
[14:03.970 --> 14:05.790]  I figured it out.
[14:06.210 --> 14:06.910]  What?
[14:08.010 --> 14:08.490]  Oh, it's health.
[14:09.390 --> 14:10.490]  Oh, my God.
[14:11.570 --> 14:13.350]  Is this game just broken?
[14:14.130 --> 14:15.310]  I don't need...
[14:15.310 --> 14:16.750]  Oh, nice.
[14:17.030 --> 14:20.430]  Oh, that's like
[14:20.430 --> 14:21.370]  an electricity thing.
[14:21.370 --> 14:23.190]  I don't think you can go on that.
[14:24.510 --> 14:25.690]  That's gonna hurt you
[14:25.690 --> 14:27.590]  and you're gonna fall and you're gonna fuck this whole thing up.
[14:28.010 --> 14:28.790]  Does it move?
[14:28.910 --> 14:29.730]  I don't think so.
[14:31.230 --> 14:32.850]  Look around to where you need to land.
[14:33.910 --> 14:35.490]  I don't think it shows until you start
[14:35.490 --> 14:35.950]  falling.
[14:37.390 --> 14:39.670]  But there's so many different ways you can go here.
[14:41.910 --> 14:42.950]  Oh, over there maybe?
[14:43.550 --> 14:44.570]  No, I don't think so.
[14:44.630 --> 14:45.110]  Is that it?
[14:45.250 --> 14:47.810]  No, that's stink bugs.
[14:48.670 --> 14:49.610]  Where is it?
[14:50.630 --> 14:51.590]  Well, I think...
[14:51.590 --> 14:53.630]  Go to the top of the car, I guess.
[14:55.870 --> 14:56.810]  I don't know, man.
[14:57.410 --> 14:58.450]  I don't see a spot.
[14:59.190 --> 15:02.170]  Oh, health.
[15:02.550 --> 15:02.710]  Nice.
[15:03.210 --> 15:04.150]  In his little weed jar.
[15:06.810 --> 15:07.610]  Minigame unlocked!
[15:07.770 --> 15:08.810]  But we don't know which one.
[15:09.270 --> 15:10.950]  The one I found needed 50.
[15:11.350 --> 15:14.070]  Not the one that needs 50. Definitely the one that needs 30.
[15:14.150 --> 15:15.450]  The one that we haven't found yet.
[15:15.450 --> 15:17.350]  Oh, fuck. It's okay, you can bounce up.
[15:17.990 --> 15:18.810]  Oh, bugs!
[15:19.030 --> 15:19.570]  Oh, shit.
[15:21.330 --> 15:21.530]  Okay.
[15:23.070 --> 15:24.610]  Yeah, this is good.
[15:24.710 --> 15:26.490]  This is how a rat does it.
[15:26.990 --> 15:28.670]  He doesn't just dive right in.
[15:29.270 --> 15:30.810]  I don't know.
[15:30.970 --> 15:33.390]  I'm just saying that's how I assume a rat does it.
[15:33.410 --> 15:34.090]  Well, you're a rat guy.
[15:34.190 --> 15:37.350]  I feel like if anyone knows, it's you.
[15:38.050 --> 15:39.230]  Oh, no, it's this again.
[15:40.010 --> 15:41.530]  It's another locked one
[15:41.530 --> 15:42.450]  for 50.
[15:42.450 --> 15:43.410]  We went in a circle.
[15:44.910 --> 15:45.830]  No, I think...
[15:45.830 --> 15:47.670]  I think this is on the opposite side.
[15:48.890 --> 15:49.570]  Oh, is it?
[15:49.590 --> 15:50.890]  Is this the same side?
[15:51.050 --> 15:52.430]  I think this is the other side.
[15:52.850 --> 15:55.110]  Oh, you're right, because there's no back to that car
[15:55.110 --> 15:56.790]  of the box that dropped out or whatever.
[15:58.490 --> 15:59.710]  What the fuck?
[16:01.310 --> 16:02.090]  There's a lot of answers.
[16:02.110 --> 16:03.370]  This feels very familiar.
[16:04.010 --> 16:06.150]  Oh, it's because I did this with the ghost.
[16:06.370 --> 16:06.610]  Or whatever.
[16:08.150 --> 16:10.450]  You better get that health.
[16:10.450 --> 16:11.930]  You better get that fucking health.
[16:12.870 --> 16:14.110]  I thought it was a coin.
[16:14.370 --> 16:16.030]  So I just lost health to get health.
[16:16.530 --> 16:16.930]  That's great.
[16:17.650 --> 16:19.630]  Okay, the dog's there, so don't go that way.
[16:19.710 --> 16:20.790]  We have to go up.
[16:21.470 --> 16:24.830]  So you gotta climb that and everything, because it's a...
[16:24.830 --> 16:26.550]  I think what we need to do
[16:26.550 --> 16:28.370]  is go to where the ghost
[16:28.370 --> 16:29.590]  was leading us originally,
[16:29.790 --> 16:30.910]  and we need to go grab that bonus.
[16:32.550 --> 16:33.630]  I'm gonna pop in the truck real quick.
[16:33.630 --> 16:34.910]  Yeah, you wanna check out what the truck's all about?
[16:35.750 --> 16:37.370]  Yeah, just knock it out.
[16:37.370 --> 16:38.390]  Make sure it's clear.
[16:40.610 --> 16:41.570]  Okay, we gotta get that
[16:41.570 --> 16:43.490]  sweet bonus content. Also, we need to figure out
[16:43.490 --> 16:43.830]  what the cheats are.
[16:45.350 --> 16:46.950]  Whoa, that was crazy.
[16:47.690 --> 16:48.470]  Wow, okay.
[16:49.970 --> 16:51.450]  The level of detail
[16:51.450 --> 16:53.250]  in this game is very odd.
[16:53.650 --> 16:55.710]  Like, for what they choose to incorporate
[16:55.710 --> 16:57.250]  and what they decide is not needed.
[16:57.370 --> 16:59.430]  Things that hurt you suddenly and things that
[16:59.430 --> 17:00.810]  don't, and it's...
[17:01.330 --> 17:03.350]  Okay, so jump on one side, then quickly jump on the other.
[17:03.530 --> 17:05.470]  There you go. Now you're doing it
[17:05.470 --> 17:07.230]  rat style, baby. Let's go.
[17:10.990 --> 17:12.930]  I think you gotta get on top of the light.
[17:14.050 --> 17:15.130]  Oh, is it Pixar?
[17:15.490 --> 17:16.490]  We doing the Pixar thing?
[17:17.110 --> 17:17.890]  Yeah, fucking jump on.
[17:18.850 --> 17:21.010]  Maybe this is how the level ends or something,
[17:21.090 --> 17:22.090]  because you can't do anything here.
[17:22.190 --> 17:24.110]  Maybe. There's nothing here yet.
[17:24.270 --> 17:27.210]  Not yet. I think once we get to 100, maybe.
[17:28.250 --> 17:28.550]  Okay.
[17:28.890 --> 17:29.210]  Rough.
[17:30.870 --> 17:32.190]  Let's go get that bonus content.
[17:32.190 --> 17:33.190]  Yeah, let's go get the bonus content.
[17:33.870 --> 17:35.190]  That's what the people, honestly,
[17:35.410 --> 17:37.630]  and I know the people watching this at home,
[17:37.710 --> 17:40.350]  they're going, ooh, give me the Ratatouille bonus content
[17:40.350 --> 17:42.830]  from the Ratatouille video game 2007, guys.
[17:42.950 --> 17:43.570]  Come on.
[17:43.790 --> 17:45.650]  If we don't get
[17:46.130 --> 17:47.810]  a bonus video or anything from this,
[17:47.870 --> 17:49.930]  I got my little bonus worked up my sleeve.
[17:50.150 --> 17:51.190]  We're ending with a bonus.
[17:51.550 --> 17:54.230]  Oh, you're gonna find out. You're gonna love it, Eric.
[17:54.650 --> 17:55.050]  Nope.
[17:55.810 --> 17:57.770]  Shit, I was so excited about my bonus.
[17:57.970 --> 18:00.690]  You're thinking about potential bonus content.
[18:00.690 --> 18:01.930]  You can't focus on the game.
[18:02.850 --> 18:04.570]  I do. I'm locking it in.
[18:05.050 --> 18:05.890]  We're gonna get that coin.
[18:06.110 --> 18:08.190]  We're gonna get to 50. We're gonna do all these mini-games.
[18:08.270 --> 18:10.750]  It's gonna be great. This is great. And this is your official guide.
[18:11.190 --> 18:11.270]  Oh.
[18:12.970 --> 18:15.070]  We should transcribe
[18:15.070 --> 18:16.610]  this video and then sell it
[18:16.610 --> 18:18.050]  as a strategy guide.
[18:18.150 --> 18:19.790]  Not the official strategy guide.
[18:23.840 --> 18:24.520]  Prima can't
[18:24.520 --> 18:26.440]  be doing anything. Nuh-uh. Oh, what the fuck?
[18:26.880 --> 18:28.220]  Hang on, hang on. It's currently locked.
[18:28.220 --> 18:30.380]  Why is everything locked? Complete other missions.
[18:30.840 --> 18:31.720]  Oh my god.
[18:31.900 --> 18:34.220]  You have to get the bonus content and then we have to come back
[18:34.220 --> 18:35.800]  for whatever this is.
[18:37.460 --> 18:38.640]  Don't. Don't get caught up.
[18:38.780 --> 18:40.360]  The ant army has invaded.
[18:41.300 --> 18:42.540]  Yeah, bring it on, ant army.
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.300]  You've gotta be kidding me. Andrew.
[18:44.980 --> 18:45.840]  We have hit B.
[18:48.660 --> 18:49.280]  Okay, there you go.
[18:50.020 --> 18:51.980]  Run him over, baby. There you go.
[18:52.540 --> 18:54.600]  Boom. No! Oh, shit. Avoidance.
[18:54.740 --> 18:55.660]  Oh, wow. He's strong.
[18:57.600 --> 18:57.980]  What the?
[18:57.980 --> 18:58.760]  What is happening?
[18:59.440 --> 19:01.520]  There you go. You just have to get a little bit of speed.
[19:02.140 --> 19:02.560]  There you go.
[19:03.020 --> 19:05.980]  Not many people know, but Remy fucking hates ants.
[19:06.300 --> 19:07.500]  All he wants to do
[19:07.500 --> 19:09.560]  is kill every fucking ant
[19:09.560 --> 19:10.420]  on this planet.
[19:10.660 --> 19:12.520]  He can't stand them.
[19:12.960 --> 19:15.320]  He thinks they're all gross. He thinks they're dirty.
[19:15.700 --> 19:17.600]  He's gotta get rid of all the fucking ants.
[19:17.940 --> 19:19.300]  He's stealing all his cheese.
[19:19.500 --> 19:20.480]  How many is that? Like five?
[19:22.080 --> 19:23.400]  I think more than that.
[19:23.480 --> 19:25.000]  I think seven. Seven is the bottom left.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.560]  Oh, I didn't even see that. Great.
[19:27.600 --> 19:28.200]  Almost there.
[19:29.200 --> 19:30.320]  Oh, I have so much time.
[19:30.860 --> 19:32.700]  Nine. Okay, but you're saying that now.
[19:32.820 --> 19:33.960]  Where's the last one, baby?
[19:35.680 --> 19:36.420]  You gotta look around.
[19:37.220 --> 19:37.740]  He's hiding.
[19:37.880 --> 19:39.400]  You fucking ant.
[19:41.480 --> 19:42.480]  There he is.
[19:42.580 --> 19:44.380]  You son of a bitch.
[19:45.480 --> 19:46.380]  Gotcha. Yes!
[19:47.440 --> 19:47.840]  Alright.
[19:49.420 --> 19:50.220]  The exterminator.
[19:50.280 --> 19:52.400]  And guys, that's how you get the exterminator
[19:52.400 --> 19:54.480]  for Cheevo for Ratatouille
[19:54.480 --> 19:56.440]  2007 Xbox 360.
[19:57.340 --> 19:58.600]  Just follow that simple
[19:58.600 --> 20:00.480]  guide. Just follow that simple guide.
[20:00.500 --> 20:02.220]  I was thinking
[20:02.220 --> 20:04.360]  when you beat it, it went green below
[20:04.360 --> 20:06.380]  it to indicate it, and then just confirming
[20:06.380 --> 20:07.840]  that no, they just all do that.
[20:08.100 --> 20:09.440]  They all just have a green thing.
[20:09.600 --> 20:12.080]  You would think it would indicate that, like, okay, you did it,
[20:12.140 --> 20:13.440]  but they don't give a fuck.
[20:13.680 --> 20:14.560]  And, uh, the end.
[20:16.200 --> 20:17.860]  Let's get the chef's hat coin.
[20:17.980 --> 20:19.700]  I feel like that might be the bonus content.
[20:19.700 --> 20:21.880]  I mean, it's definitely
[20:21.880 --> 20:23.940]  like, it's like the rat face
[20:23.940 --> 20:25.220]  and the chef thing, right?
[20:25.680 --> 20:26.920]  It's over here on the right.
[20:27.280 --> 20:27.960]  Isn't that what this is?
[20:30.040 --> 20:31.240]  I don't know if you can...
[20:31.240 --> 20:33.960]  Oh, shit. Oh, you're getting fucking gutsy, dude.
[20:34.840 --> 20:34.960]  Oh!
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.280]  No! No! No!
[20:38.400 --> 20:39.320]  Got it.
[20:39.980 --> 20:41.500]  Bonus pack 05!
[20:42.120 --> 20:42.580]  Hell yeah!
[20:43.880 --> 20:45.760]  Okay. Who knows what the
[20:45.760 --> 20:47.760]  fuck that is? Not us. I'm excited to
[20:47.760 --> 20:49.440]  find out. And you can find out at
[20:49.440 --> 20:50.960]  Andrew. Andrew.
[20:52.280 --> 20:52.640]  Andrew.
[20:56.440 --> 20:57.780]  I like... Oh, see, there's
[20:57.780 --> 20:59.440]  green coins up here you didn't even get. This is great.
[20:59.940 --> 21:01.820]  It put you back to where you needed to be.
[21:01.860 --> 21:02.260]  You know what I'm saying?
[21:03.740 --> 21:05.580]  I feel like I got these, though.
[21:05.680 --> 21:07.720]  But whatever. That's fine. I mean, you're at 41,
[21:07.960 --> 21:09.320]  so you haven't. You know what I mean?
[21:09.720 --> 21:11.320]  I know. Like, I understand.
[21:11.320 --> 21:13.820]  Are you saying that you think that they repopulate?
[21:15.940 --> 21:16.280]  I'm
[21:16.280 --> 21:17.360]  wondering that, yes.
[21:18.080 --> 21:20.200]  Well, jump on this thing, because this is the box
[21:20.200 --> 21:21.060]  from earlier.
[21:22.520 --> 21:23.780]  I think that's it. It's right there.
[21:25.000 --> 21:26.060]  Just getting mad
[21:26.060 --> 21:27.820]  at it. Hey, that was on me.
[21:28.160 --> 21:30.240]  That was my fault. What was the point
[21:30.240 --> 21:32.160]  of just making it easier to get up?
[21:32.240 --> 21:34.080]  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stay simple.
[21:34.300 --> 21:35.900]  And then you go up here to the right. I want to get all those coins.
[21:36.220 --> 21:37.820]  Oh, you're going to go get them? You're going to go get these coins.
[21:38.020 --> 21:39.900]  Okay. I want to get these other coins.
[21:40.160 --> 21:40.380]  Get them.
[21:41.420 --> 21:42.580]  Oh, no, there's a cat!
[21:42.900 --> 21:44.560]  Run! That's a fucking cat!
[21:44.880 --> 21:45.840]  Okay, we haven't been here.
[21:46.320 --> 21:48.140]  That's what I'm saying, man. Jesus
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.240]  Christ. You gotta go get these coins, dude.
[21:50.280 --> 21:52.320]  What the fuck? Did the cat
[21:52.320 --> 21:54.540]  do that? Yeah, it launched
[21:54.540 --> 21:56.640]  a furball at us. I don't like that.
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.660]  That's the other game.
[21:58.860 --> 22:00.360]  Okay. Yeah. Okay, here
[22:00.360 --> 22:02.320]  we go. Now we're going to go get these. We're going to go get
[22:02.320 --> 22:02.880]  these coins.
[22:04.960 --> 22:06.480]  I mean, we've definitely been over here
[22:06.480 --> 22:07.280]  and done this.
[22:08.960 --> 22:09.580]  I'm a pro
[22:09.580 --> 22:11.540]  at this. Yeah, yeah, you're so fucking good at that.
[22:11.620 --> 22:13.340]  There you go. Hell, yeah.
[22:13.500 --> 22:15.000]  Okay. Okay.
[22:16.040 --> 22:17.720]  Great. Way to go, man. As intended.
[22:17.820 --> 22:18.660]  Jump up there to the right.
[22:20.340 --> 22:21.160]  It won't let me.
[22:21.400 --> 22:21.660]  What?
[22:23.320 --> 22:24.500]  Wait, why? What?
[22:26.220 --> 22:26.580]  No!
[22:28.180 --> 22:29.140]  Okay, I gotta go back.
[22:30.320 --> 22:31.420]  Can I climb up this?
[22:31.520 --> 22:32.680]  Can I... wait. Nope.
[22:34.840 --> 22:35.200]  Okay.
[22:35.200 --> 22:37.300]  There's not a faster way to do it either.
[22:37.380 --> 22:38.400]  Oh my god.
[22:39.240 --> 22:41.420]  Wait, do I have to go all the way? I think so.
[22:43.040 --> 22:43.400]  Okay.
[22:43.760 --> 22:45.260]  Let's get on this. Brutal.
[22:47.080 --> 22:47.780]  We'll be fine.
[22:47.820 --> 22:49.080]  You almost have enough for that minigame, though.
[22:50.300 --> 22:51.280]  I'm so excited
[22:51.280 --> 22:52.140]  to get 50.
[22:56.180 --> 22:56.900]  What skins
[22:56.900 --> 22:58.820]  would you put in this game if you could have
[22:58.820 --> 22:59.600]  other rats in it?
[23:01.060 --> 23:03.140]  Ooh. I mean, I won't even limit you to rats.
[23:03.280 --> 23:04.780]  You can also do, like, mice
[23:04.780 --> 23:06.920]  if you want to do mice. Mice are fine, I think, for this.
[23:07.400 --> 23:08.920]  I want a Tom
[23:08.920 --> 23:11.060]  or Jerry skin. I don't remember who is who.
[23:11.100 --> 23:12.620]  That's pretty good. Jerry is the mouse.
[23:13.760 --> 23:14.880]  Uh, Stuart Little?
[23:15.040 --> 23:16.680]  Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one.
[23:17.260 --> 23:17.540]  Okay.
[23:18.780 --> 23:20.940]  You know, my mom has beef with you, Eric, she told me.
[23:21.000 --> 23:21.960]  With what? What'd I do?
[23:23.460 --> 23:24.620]  My mom told me
[23:24.620 --> 23:25.960]  she has beef with you.
[23:26.560 --> 23:28.640]  You apparently posted something about
[23:28.640 --> 23:29.780]  Stuart Little recently.
[23:30.940 --> 23:32.960]  There was a picture that I found
[23:32.960 --> 23:34.640]  that said Stuart Little
[23:34.640 --> 23:37.080]  shot dead in Houston, Texas.
[23:38.300 --> 23:39.100]  It's been
[23:39.100 --> 23:40.760]  making me laugh for, like, a year.
[23:41.080 --> 23:43.100]  And I just, I think about it, and I'll just post it
[23:43.100 --> 23:43.540]  sometimes.
[23:45.300 --> 23:46.520]  Your mom hated that?
[23:47.480 --> 23:49.120]  My mom hated it. It's a big Stuart Little
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.680]  fan. She did not like it.
[23:50.780 --> 23:53.120]  That's funny. There's a green coin over there to your left,
[23:53.240 --> 23:53.320]  dude.
[23:54.780 --> 23:57.020]  Oh, bonus content! Wait, wait, wait, ratty, ratty,
[23:57.060 --> 23:58.660]  ratty coin. Boom.
[23:59.180 --> 24:00.840]  Don't call it a fucking
[24:01.160 --> 24:01.720]  ratty coin.
[24:02.980 --> 24:05.040]  I know who would not be in this
[24:05.040 --> 24:06.580]  fucking game if I have a say.
[24:08.340 --> 24:08.920]  Oh, here's
[24:08.920 --> 24:10.880]  the ball. I don't think you have to get on the ball to go
[24:10.880 --> 24:12.820]  over there, do you? I think you just need to go over there
[24:12.820 --> 24:14.600]  and get those coins. No. You're...
[24:14.600 --> 24:16.720]  Fuck! You're just fucking around getting hit by this
[24:16.720 --> 24:17.600]  fucking cat, dude.
[24:19.180 --> 24:19.920]  I'm getting the coins.
[24:20.540 --> 24:22.860]  I'm getting the coins. You're three
[24:22.860 --> 24:24.880]  away. There's two... Oh, there's, and then
[24:24.880 --> 24:25.920]  there's two more over there.
[24:26.920 --> 24:29.080]  Did you see them on your left? Yeah, but how do I...
[24:29.080 --> 24:31.080]  I think you just gotta go over there. Maybe I...
[24:31.820 --> 24:33.120]  I can't jump that
[24:33.120 --> 24:35.080]  high. I think I need
[24:35.080 --> 24:37.120]  the ball. Try it. Grab the ball.
[24:37.260 --> 24:39.080]  Let's go. I mean, I definitely
[24:39.080 --> 24:41.240]  need the ball for something. For something. But who the
[24:41.240 --> 24:42.340]  fuck knows what.
[24:43.340 --> 24:45.040]  I think it might be... Fuck you, Jesus
[24:45.040 --> 24:46.980]  Christ. You're gonna die. You're gonna fucking die.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.040]  Steph Curry is a cat. Oh, slap
[24:49.040 --> 24:51.080]  that thing. There you go. You got your health back. You're
[24:51.080 --> 24:52.960]  good. Steph Curry.
[24:53.700 --> 24:55.160]  I'm a Caitlyn Clark. I'm a
[24:55.160 --> 24:56.520]  Caitlyn Clark guy now.
[24:56.520 --> 24:58.640]  Steph Curry. Old hat, dude.
[24:58.940 --> 25:00.740]  Oh, you missed. You fucking missed.
[25:02.060 --> 25:02.760]  There you go.
[25:03.240 --> 25:04.640]  There you go. And then get that other one.
[25:04.940 --> 25:06.660]  There you go. Oh, that makes
[25:06.660 --> 25:08.620]  life so much easier. 49.
[25:08.900 --> 25:10.720]  You're one away from that dope-ass
[25:10.720 --> 25:12.900]  minigame. Fuck it. Stop.
[25:13.420 --> 25:14.640]  You stupid fucking
[25:14.640 --> 25:16.680]  cat. Hit the... Andrew, hit
[25:16.680 --> 25:18.580]  the button. Andrew, hit the fucking
[25:18.580 --> 25:20.320]  button. Eat shit.
[25:21.360 --> 25:22.420]  Guys, that's right.
[25:22.640 --> 25:24.600]  You can attack the cat in this game
[25:24.600 --> 25:25.400]  if you want to.
[25:27.460 --> 25:28.600]  I think we did
[25:28.600 --> 25:29.260]  that. Yeah.
[25:30.880 --> 25:32.580]  Stupid bugs. Fuck these stink
[25:32.580 --> 25:34.720]  bugs. The dog's over there. We already
[25:34.720 --> 25:36.400]  did this. There's gotta be a way to climb
[25:36.400 --> 25:37.460]  where you were.
[25:38.480 --> 25:40.540]  Because if you go over here, this is where the dog is and you're gonna get
[25:40.540 --> 25:41.060]  fucked up.
[25:43.840 --> 25:44.220]  Like
[25:44.220 --> 25:46.100]  where you were
[25:46.620 --> 25:48.860]  it looked like there was a way to climb
[25:49.320 --> 25:49.700]  up.
[25:51.700 --> 25:52.460]  So go...
[25:52.460 --> 25:54.220]  No, I think it's gotta be back behind you.
[25:54.380 --> 25:56.460]  Like over where the ball was. Like where you grabbed
[25:56.460 --> 25:58.440]  the ball from. Okay. There looked like there
[25:58.440 --> 26:00.400]  was a way to like jump up
[26:00.400 --> 26:02.360]  and climb up there but I don't know
[26:02.360 --> 26:04.580]  how necessarily. Have we done that mission
[26:04.580 --> 26:06.180]  next to the car? Uh, I
[26:06.540 --> 26:08.220]  don't know. I thought so. Maybe not.
[26:08.960 --> 26:10.060]  Hit the cat and find out. There you go.
[26:11.360 --> 26:12.440]  No. Whatever.
[26:12.900 --> 26:14.260]  We're doing it. Alright, here we go.
[26:14.340 --> 26:16.040]  Let's dash, baby. Was that Hal
[26:16.040 --> 26:16.580]  Bow Wow?
[26:18.880 --> 26:19.800]  What was that?
[26:19.800 --> 26:21.500]  That was a little Bow Wow.
[26:21.600 --> 26:23.700]  Find the way across the alley and up to the top of the arch.
[26:25.400 --> 26:26.080]  Oh, okay.
[26:26.620 --> 26:27.560]  We're scaring the dog.
[26:28.020 --> 26:29.800]  That's good. I like scaring
[26:30.320 --> 26:31.160]  Geoff's dog here.
[26:32.060 --> 26:33.520]  Wait, what is right over?
[26:33.680 --> 26:35.520]  I don't know. Maybe it's like a health... what?
[26:36.360 --> 26:37.860]  Find your way to the other side of the alley
[26:37.860 --> 26:39.540]  and over the top. Oh, it's like
[26:39.540 --> 26:40.960]  it's him giving you like a hint.
[26:42.140 --> 26:43.640]  Okay. That's all it is.
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.600]  I guess we go this way.
[26:45.660 --> 26:47.480]  I don't fucking know. Can you sniff or something?
[26:48.700 --> 26:49.300]  Oh, yeah.
[26:49.320 --> 26:51.640]  You're right. I can. Yeah, there you go. So that's the way you go.
[26:51.760 --> 26:52.060]  Oh, I forgot.
[26:53.240 --> 26:55.500]  You're going to need to remind me every time we get confused
[26:55.500 --> 26:57.480]  because I will not remember that that is a mechanic.
[26:57.640 --> 26:58.960]  I have a friend...
[26:58.960 --> 27:01.520]  Dude, I actually have a friend named Andrew
[27:01.520 --> 27:03.620]  who is so similar in that way
[27:03.620 --> 27:05.420]  where he doesn't... he used to play video games
[27:05.420 --> 27:07.280]  a lot and now he's like a real person
[27:07.280 --> 27:09.560]  and doesn't really play video games as often
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.460]  but he still enjoys them. So he'll play something
[27:11.460 --> 27:13.580]  like Red Dead and it'll
[27:13.580 --> 27:15.640]  just be like, oh yeah, don't forget to
[27:15.640 --> 27:17.680]  reload. And he's like, oh yeah, you have
[27:17.680 --> 27:19.700]  to do that. And it's like, what the fuck do
[27:19.700 --> 27:21.420]  you mean? We'll play Smash Brothers
[27:21.420 --> 27:23.460]  and it's like, he'll play like Samus and I'm like,
[27:23.520 --> 27:25.540]  oh yeah, don't forget you have bombs. He's like,
[27:25.560 --> 27:27.160]  oh yeah, bombs. It's like, what?
[27:27.580 --> 27:29.620]  It's like, why do I have to remind you?
[27:29.920 --> 27:30.960]  What are you talking about?
[27:32.100 --> 27:33.540]  Just remember one thing
[27:33.540 --> 27:35.680]  while you're playing this thing and then forget it later.
[27:35.760 --> 27:36.380]  I don't care.
[27:37.920 --> 27:39.640]  Okay. Use the sniff before you
[27:39.640 --> 27:41.440]  jump up there. And then you jumped up there. That's good.
[27:42.780 --> 27:43.500]  I'm sorry.
[27:44.840 --> 27:45.240]  Okay.
[27:45.760 --> 27:47.660]  We're good. You're going the right way.
[27:47.740 --> 27:48.980]  I just wanted to make sure you're going the right way.
[27:49.260 --> 27:51.860]  I don't want to waste everyone's time
[27:51.860 --> 27:53.700]  who just wants to get the achievement
[27:53.700 --> 27:54.200]  hunting.
[27:55.740 --> 27:57.820]  Oh my god. Oh my fucking god.
[27:59.040 --> 27:59.360]  Okay.
[28:00.440 --> 28:01.460]  Remember, these things move.
[28:02.080 --> 28:02.620]  These move. Okay.
[28:03.740 --> 28:05.380]  I hate platforming so much.
[28:05.500 --> 28:07.780]  I fucking hate platforming. It makes my butthole
[28:07.780 --> 28:09.680]  so tight. It makes me not
[28:09.680 --> 28:11.300]  feel good. I don't like it.
[28:11.300 --> 28:13.300]  Oh, it gives me so much
[28:13.300 --> 28:15.280]  anxiety. Platforming gives me so much anxiety.
[28:16.340 --> 28:17.440]  Was there a game that
[28:17.440 --> 28:18.440]  made you feel that way?
[28:19.720 --> 28:21.140]  It's Mario. It's everything.
[28:21.300 --> 28:23.100]  Since I was a kid, I've been like
[28:23.100 --> 28:25.200]  not like I'm bad at platforming, but
[28:25.200 --> 28:27.500]  definitely like, oh, this gives me so much anxiety.
[28:28.060 --> 28:29.080]  I don't want to do it.
[28:29.560 --> 28:30.240]  Oh, oh, land on the right!
[28:31.500 --> 28:33.280]  Oh, there it is. There it is. There it is. That's it.
[28:33.840 --> 28:34.900]  It's in the hole!
[28:35.740 --> 28:37.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you get the
[28:38.620 --> 28:39.260]  five gold
[28:40.180 --> 28:41.220]  Fly Remi Fly
[28:41.220 --> 28:43.420]  achievement. You saw it here first.
[28:43.540 --> 28:45.260]  Don't forget to mimic exactly what
[28:45.260 --> 28:47.060]  we're doing one-to-one. Otherwise,
[28:47.220 --> 28:49.120]  I don't know if these will unlock for you.
[28:49.640 --> 28:51.240]  No, yeah, definitely do it once
[28:51.240 --> 28:53.180]  before, have it not appear, and then do it
[28:53.180 --> 28:55.180]  a second time and it decide to appear.
[28:56.380 --> 28:57.300]  It's all part
[28:57.300 --> 28:59.120]  of the plan. It's all part of the plan.
[28:59.480 --> 29:01.120]  You're only one green away from unlocking
[29:01.120 --> 29:03.180]  the minigame, dude. I know. I'm so close.
[29:03.240 --> 29:05.280]  We're so close. Be able to see what it is.
[29:05.340 --> 29:07.440]  Alright, hit your nose again. There you go. Okay, good.
[29:07.440 --> 29:08.860]  That's the right way. We're on the same wavelength.
[29:09.020 --> 29:10.580]  I assume this is the right way to go.
[29:10.980 --> 29:13.820]  Oh, we're gonna hit this
[29:13.820 --> 29:15.480]  fucking thing over. Oh, we're
[29:15.480 --> 29:16.720]  fucking hitting it.
[29:17.600 --> 29:18.320]  Hit RB.
[29:19.640 --> 29:21.460]  That's the smell of a scared
[29:21.460 --> 29:23.460]  dog. There we go. Tail swipe
[29:23.460 --> 29:25.500]  the plant. Take this, Geoff's dog.
[29:27.020 --> 29:27.420]  Get
[29:27.420 --> 29:28.920]  out of here, Artie. Yeah!
[29:31.000 --> 29:31.500]  Oh, he's
[29:31.500 --> 29:33.640]  gonna scare the cat. Oh, and the box fell.
[29:33.700 --> 29:35.460]  Oh, shit. Oh, dude, this unlocked
[29:36.000 --> 29:36.400]  everything.
[29:38.040 --> 29:38.440]  Dude.
[29:40.720 --> 29:41.500]  Wait, is it gonna
[29:41.500 --> 29:43.320]  send me back down to the car? Oh, no.
[29:43.860 --> 29:44.980]  Hang on. It's gonna send you to the
[29:45.720 --> 29:47.580]  sewer. Wait. It's gonna send
[29:47.580 --> 29:49.420]  you to the sewer again. No. Yes.
[29:49.540 --> 29:51.400]  No. Yes. No. Yes.
[29:52.840 --> 29:53.760]  There's no way.
[29:54.020 --> 29:55.020]  Oh, good. Okay, cool.
[29:55.860 --> 29:57.380]  But now you can shortcut it.
[29:57.480 --> 29:59.420]  You can go over to... The cat's still fucking
[29:59.420 --> 30:01.180]  here, really? Uh...
[30:01.180 --> 30:03.600]  Get out of here. I think you can go over
[30:03.600 --> 30:05.580]  there to the right. I mean, you can jump up
[30:05.580 --> 30:07.680]  and all this stuff, but he knocks stuff down.
[30:07.800 --> 30:09.380]  So you can, like, go over there.
[30:10.320 --> 30:11.140]  Oh, my God.
[30:11.640 --> 30:13.400]  Oh, my God. This funky
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.580]  fucking feline, dude.
[30:16.900 --> 30:17.880]  So you can...
[30:18.560 --> 30:19.620]  He knocks stuff
[30:19.620 --> 30:21.620]  over, so I thought maybe it was easier to get up
[30:21.620 --> 30:23.500]  that way. I'm really excited to see that it
[30:23.500 --> 30:25.480]  is here in just a minute when we work
[30:25.480 --> 30:26.460]  our way all the way back.
[30:27.260 --> 30:27.660]  Yep.
[30:30.100 --> 30:31.380]  You're a fucking pro
[30:31.380 --> 30:32.960]  at this part, dude. Yeah.
[30:33.120 --> 30:34.340]  You're flying at this part.
[30:35.220 --> 30:36.480]  Yeah. Okay.
[30:37.700 --> 30:38.840]  Nobody clip that.
[30:40.880 --> 30:41.320]  Nobody
[30:42.100 --> 30:43.540]  clip that specifically.
[30:43.900 --> 30:45.160]  I'm flying
[30:45.160 --> 30:47.220]  through it. I'm...
[30:47.220 --> 30:49.160]  I got this locked down.
[30:49.500 --> 30:51.480]  Oh, Andrew, this part... Dude, you're so good at this part.
[30:51.540 --> 30:53.440]  You're so good. This is great. You've never fucked this
[30:53.440 --> 30:54.760]  up once. Oh, no.
[30:57.120 --> 30:59.300]  Well, it is canon that Rebby dies in a can
[30:59.300 --> 31:01.300]  of yellow paint. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's...
[31:01.300 --> 31:03.140]  The rest of this game is a dream, so
[31:03.140 --> 31:04.200]  I think that's how it goes.
[31:09.500 --> 31:11.000]  Whoa. Did I just jump it?
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.200]  Yeah, I think so. There you go. Okay, so keep
[31:13.200 --> 31:15.040]  going. The shortcut was this way, right?
[31:15.040 --> 31:17.040]  Yeah, yeah. It's further. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep going. Keep going.
[31:17.380 --> 31:19.240]  And then you go up. Yeah, you bounce
[31:19.240 --> 31:20.460]  on that thing and you can go up there.
[31:21.340 --> 31:22.920]  Boom. Just like that, baby.
[31:23.220 --> 31:25.220]  Just like that. And then there, he knocked
[31:25.220 --> 31:26.740]  down the grate for you.
[31:28.100 --> 31:29.180]  There we go.
[31:29.200 --> 31:30.720]  What is this? Uh-oh. There might be
[31:30.720 --> 31:32.180]  another mission. You might need 50.
[31:32.940 --> 31:33.360]  No!
[31:35.660 --> 31:36.840]  Did we already do this?
[31:38.060 --> 31:38.680]  I think
[31:38.680 --> 31:40.500]  I may have done this for fun
[31:41.100 --> 31:42.660]  at the end of the last video.
[31:44.440 --> 31:44.960]  I think
[31:44.960 --> 31:46.900]  this is the 10 things.
[31:47.700 --> 31:48.500]  Well, I didn't know the...
[31:48.500 --> 31:50.780]  Oh, shit! Alright. Andrew,
[31:50.960 --> 31:52.760]  you already know how to do this, though. Lock in.
[31:52.960 --> 31:53.940]  Get him. Go back.
[31:53.940 --> 31:55.720]  There you go. Go back. There you go.
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  Nope. Yep. Okay. You're so sensitive.
[31:58.160 --> 31:59.920]  You got it. You got it. You got it. Pick a side
[31:59.920 --> 32:01.860]  and stick with it. You got it. You missed.
[32:03.420 --> 32:04.100]  Up and over.
[32:04.200 --> 32:06.200]  You're good. Get that one. You're good.
[32:06.300 --> 32:07.800]  Stick in the middle. That's good.
[32:07.860 --> 32:09.680]  You got it. Okay. Yeah.
[32:09.860 --> 32:11.780]  Now stick to the side. Pick your side.
[32:12.020 --> 32:13.460]  There you go. I'm just gonna go right...
[32:13.460 --> 32:15.340]  Oh, shit. I got caught up. You're alright. You're alright.
[32:15.580 --> 32:18.020]  You're clearing out the right right now. That's good.
[32:19.740 --> 32:20.060]  Okay.
[32:20.200 --> 32:22.240]  You gotta work your way to the middle. Work your way to the middle.
[32:22.240 --> 32:23.520]  There you go.
[32:23.580 --> 32:25.900]  Oh, you got this one right here. No, you missed it.
[32:26.000 --> 32:27.760]  You're too far up. I overshot it.
[32:27.840 --> 32:30.760]  You're too far up. Relax. It won't let me come back.
[32:31.500 --> 32:32.620]  Relax. It won't let me come back.
[32:34.740 --> 32:36.000]  Okay. Here we go.
[32:36.540 --> 32:38.420]  Left. Eric, I don't think we can do it.
[32:38.460 --> 32:39.520]  Oh, no. I think we're running out of time.
[32:39.740 --> 32:41.680]  Oh, no. Left.
[32:42.140 --> 32:43.640]  Come on. Come on.
[32:43.640 --> 32:46.220]  Come on.
[32:46.760 --> 32:47.560]  Oh, no.
[32:50.910 --> 32:52.170]  Oh, you jumped.
[32:52.170 --> 32:53.830]  Why did you jump?
[32:54.650 --> 32:56.330]  I didn't. It was the angle.
[32:56.410 --> 32:57.610]  Why did you jump?
[32:58.450 --> 33:00.530]  I didn't jump. It's fine. We're doing it again.
[33:00.630 --> 33:01.710]  Okay. Got it.
[33:02.050 --> 33:03.670]  Roll back. You got it. Good.
[33:04.130 --> 33:05.850]  Okay. You're locked in. You're locked in.
[33:05.890 --> 33:08.610]  You just can't miss. Relax. Relax. Relax.
[33:09.170 --> 33:10.190]  Yeah. Yeah. I'm calming down.
[33:10.290 --> 33:11.410]  There you go. There you go.
[33:11.650 --> 33:13.450]  Right over. There it is. Right in the middle.
[33:13.910 --> 33:15.570]  Nope. Missed it. You're alright. You're alright.
[33:15.650 --> 33:17.590]  Pick a side. You got it.
[33:17.790 --> 33:18.850]  Relax. Relax.
[33:19.670 --> 33:21.130]  Yeah. We're good. We're good.
[33:21.230 --> 33:21.830]  You're good. You got it.
[33:22.490 --> 33:24.070]  Come back a little bit.
[33:24.630 --> 33:26.170]  Working left. Okay.
[33:27.190 --> 33:28.210]  Middle. Good.
[33:28.650 --> 33:30.870]  Middle. Then there's left mid.
[33:30.890 --> 33:32.830]  Yep. You got it. Left. Yep.
[33:33.130 --> 33:33.770]  Middle. Okay.
[33:34.230 --> 33:35.430]  And now work left. Work left.
[33:36.030 --> 33:37.870]  You're up too far. You're up too far.
[33:38.110 --> 33:39.530]  You're up too far.
[33:40.110 --> 33:42.390]  You only need one. Relax.
[33:43.070 --> 33:43.630]  We're okay.
[33:44.090 --> 33:45.310]  Oh, my God. Easy.
[33:46.070 --> 33:47.030]  Oh, my God.
[33:47.310 --> 33:49.450]  Oh, Andrew. That was so fucking close.
[33:49.630 --> 33:51.070]  We got some chocolate.
[33:51.530 --> 33:52.990]  Oh, my God. Chocolate.
[33:54.330 --> 33:55.310]  Is that for your...
[33:55.310 --> 33:56.490]  Hey, can you go to the
[33:57.750 --> 33:59.270]  menu? Don't you have like
[33:59.270 --> 34:01.290]  make a recipe thing or something?
[34:01.490 --> 34:02.410]  Is that what you just got?
[34:03.610 --> 34:05.110]  Oh. Yeah. Let me look.
[34:05.490 --> 34:07.050]  It's a good call. You got a piece of a recipe?
[34:07.190 --> 34:09.250]  Well, yeah. I'm here to, you know, achievement guide, you know?
[34:11.010 --> 34:11.370]  Uh...
[34:11.370 --> 34:12.670]  Oh. Oh, yeah. We did.
[34:12.670 --> 34:13.070]  Woo!
[34:14.530 --> 34:15.970]  Look at that, baby.
[34:16.870 --> 34:18.630]  I don't like this because that implies
[34:18.630 --> 34:20.130]  all of these are mini-games.
[34:20.310 --> 34:22.490]  That's a lot of mini-games to have to play.
[34:22.690 --> 34:23.130]  Dude.
[34:24.290 --> 34:26.530]  I bet you it's... This is level two.
[34:26.790 --> 34:28.110]  This is level three, four, five.
[34:28.290 --> 34:29.670]  I bet you it's just like a continuation.
[34:30.930 --> 34:32.790]  But let's go up. Let's find out.
[34:33.570 --> 34:34.490]  Let's keep climbing.
[34:34.870 --> 34:35.030]  Uh-huh.
[34:35.650 --> 34:37.030]  Did that to the right.
[34:38.330 --> 34:39.570]  Did we do this?
[34:39.570 --> 34:41.390]  Oh, no. We didn't have this before.
[34:41.810 --> 34:43.910]  Rooftop rolling is new. I agree.
[34:44.830 --> 34:45.270]  Oh.
[34:46.030 --> 34:46.470]  Okay.
[34:47.510 --> 34:49.090]  You gotta pick stuff up.
[34:49.950 --> 34:51.070]  Yeah. Okay.
[34:51.110 --> 34:52.630]  Probably like the recipe thing again. Yeah.
[34:53.010 --> 34:54.310]  Find a way to the nest.
[34:58.930 --> 35:01.330]  I think this is like a story mission.
[35:01.450 --> 35:03.510]  I don't think this is gonna be like a timed goofy one.
[35:06.150 --> 35:06.970]  What the fuck?
[35:06.970 --> 35:08.030]  Oh, my God. Run.
[35:08.650 --> 35:09.690]  Don't lean. Go!
[35:11.810 --> 35:13.130]  Fifty. Mini-game unlocked.
[35:13.450 --> 35:13.950]  Hell, yeah.
[35:15.350 --> 35:17.810]  Yeah, I agree with you. I think this actually might be a story mission.
[35:18.030 --> 35:19.070]  So we're just gonna ignore...
[35:19.070 --> 35:20.110]  Yeah, we're gonna ignore it for now.
[35:20.610 --> 35:21.410]  There you go.
[35:22.010 --> 35:23.930]  Because we can come down here. This is where the dog was.
[35:24.290 --> 35:26.090]  So now we can lock in. Yeah, we cleared it out.
[35:26.210 --> 35:29.030]  We can clear all this stuff out where the dog was.
[35:29.770 --> 35:31.030]  You gotta be really careful, though.
[35:31.050 --> 35:31.670]  You think I can make this jump?
[35:31.910 --> 35:33.230]  No, no. There's a net.
[35:33.230 --> 35:33.870]  Nope.
[35:35.070 --> 35:37.310]  You can climb up and down on these things.
[35:38.630 --> 35:38.830]  Yeah.
[35:40.330 --> 35:40.730]  Yeah.
[35:42.470 --> 35:42.610]  Okay.
[35:43.910 --> 35:44.890]  Oh, the hot pepper.
[35:46.170 --> 35:47.430]  And you have to...
[35:47.430 --> 35:48.210]  Okay.
[35:51.070 --> 35:52.870]  Think I can blow that cat up with the pepper?
[35:52.890 --> 35:54.450]  I don't know what it's for. Maybe?
[35:54.650 --> 35:55.990]  But I don't think so. Maybe?
[35:56.950 --> 35:57.730]  Let's try it.
[35:58.690 --> 35:59.110]  Let's try it.
[35:59.110 --> 35:59.530]  Okay.
[36:00.550 --> 36:01.890]  We can blow this cat up.
[36:03.930 --> 36:04.230]  No!
[36:04.830 --> 36:06.010]  Yeah, you fucking shut up.
[36:06.270 --> 36:07.290]  Bonus content!
[36:10.650 --> 36:12.150]  That was dumb.
[36:12.970 --> 36:15.030]  Unreal. There's so many cats.
[36:15.610 --> 36:16.190]  Unreal.
[36:16.790 --> 36:18.830]  Oh my god. They hit me from all angles.
[36:18.930 --> 36:20.190]  Dude, you better go.
[36:21.990 --> 36:23.450]  Goddamn dream team out here.
[36:23.530 --> 36:24.830]  I cannot believe that happened.
[36:25.010 --> 36:26.570]  I can't believe that worked.
[36:26.570 --> 36:28.090]  That's fucking crazy.
[36:28.350 --> 36:30.670]  Stop trying to go up. This is not the way to go.
[36:30.850 --> 36:32.690]  Clearly not the way to go.
[36:33.510 --> 36:33.710]  Okay.
[36:34.410 --> 36:35.330]  I'll adjust.
[36:38.970 --> 36:39.970]  Anything up there?
[36:42.210 --> 36:43.230]  Let's blow this cat up.
[36:43.810 --> 36:45.350]  I think it's going to hit you again.
[36:48.770 --> 36:49.470]  There you go.
[36:50.950 --> 36:52.090]  You're so fucking dead.
[36:52.490 --> 36:53.370]  You're so dead.
[36:53.370 --> 36:55.670]  Oh my god.
[36:55.970 --> 36:57.850]  I killed the cat.
[36:58.350 --> 36:59.870]  Oh my god.
[37:00.570 --> 37:02.250]  I didn't think that would happen.
[37:02.390 --> 37:03.830]  I can't believe it worked.
[37:03.890 --> 37:04.410]  Oh no.
[37:05.410 --> 37:06.970]  You blew him up.
[37:07.270 --> 37:08.470]  He's fucking dead.
[37:09.070 --> 37:11.490]  Remy just murdered a cat.
[37:11.750 --> 37:13.030]  Oh my god.
[37:15.170 --> 37:16.730]  Oh my god.
[37:19.130 --> 37:21.490]  There can't be any witnesses.
[37:23.870 --> 37:25.710]  I gotta go kill this cat now.
[37:26.050 --> 37:28.490]  I think you just have a blood lust now.
[37:29.570 --> 37:31.430]  I gotta get rid of all the witnesses.
[37:32.350 --> 37:33.990]  Good luck getting this pepper back.
[37:34.150 --> 37:34.930]  You just fucked up.
[37:34.990 --> 37:35.570]  Oh no.
[37:37.770 --> 37:39.550]  Ain't no way you're getting that thing.
[37:39.730 --> 37:41.150]  You gotta get out of there.
[37:41.510 --> 37:42.290]  It'll come back.
[37:43.270 --> 37:44.310]  Oh my god.
[37:44.970 --> 37:47.230]  I cannot believe it blew up that fucking cat.
[37:47.350 --> 37:48.630]  That was so crazy.
[37:49.890 --> 37:51.610]  I don't think we even got a coin for that.
[37:51.610 --> 37:52.890]  No, I don't think anything happened.
[37:55.910 --> 37:56.470]  Uh oh.
[37:58.490 --> 37:59.950]  We're going down together!
[38:06.150 --> 38:08.210]  Remy just suicide bombed a cat.
[38:08.290 --> 38:08.890]  Oh my god.
[38:08.970 --> 38:10.090]  This game's fucking crazy.
[38:13.930 --> 38:15.470]  Okay, we're gonna ignore this man again.
[38:15.470 --> 38:17.010]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[38:17.090 --> 38:18.850]  I think you just gotta look around.
[38:18.850 --> 38:20.670]  Oh, fuck me.
[38:20.830 --> 38:21.630]  Oh my god.
[38:22.690 --> 38:23.670]  Oh man.
[38:23.890 --> 38:26.890]  You can get back to the ground.
[38:27.490 --> 38:28.850]  Right? And then...
[38:29.370 --> 38:29.850]  That's true.
[38:30.170 --> 38:32.630]  And then you can just climb around in here and shit.
[38:33.750 --> 38:34.770]  Let's do that.
[38:36.790 --> 38:37.690]  Watch out!
[38:38.250 --> 38:39.350]  Why did you stop?
[38:39.770 --> 38:41.250]  Why did that happen twice?
[38:42.250 --> 38:44.250]  The controls are not easy.
[38:47.010 --> 38:47.370]  Uh...
[38:47.370 --> 38:48.730]  Well, I tried.
[38:48.830 --> 38:49.410]  Oh my god.
[38:50.650 --> 38:52.270]  It's a genuine attempt to grab that.
[38:52.310 --> 38:54.270]  Let's get exploring. Let's see what's around here.
[38:54.330 --> 38:55.370]  Yeah, let's go over here.
[38:55.450 --> 38:56.370]  What the fuck is that?
[38:57.930 --> 39:00.030]  Can you jump on it? Or tail whip it?
[39:00.530 --> 39:01.310]  Oh my god!
[39:01.790 --> 39:04.630]  Oh, it's like a rat killing machine.
[39:05.710 --> 39:06.470]  Oh, there's some health.
[39:06.510 --> 39:07.130]  Oh, thank god.
[39:09.450 --> 39:10.170]  You just gotta...
[39:10.170 --> 39:10.870]  Ignore the pepper.
[39:10.870 --> 39:12.790]  Oh, you're gonna try to pepper that thing?
[39:13.470 --> 39:14.310]  You're crazy.
[39:14.650 --> 39:17.030]  You're crazy. Ain't no way. It's too far.
[39:17.550 --> 39:18.030]  It has to.
[39:18.570 --> 39:19.250]  No, you're right.
[39:20.930 --> 39:21.410]  Remy!
[39:22.190 --> 39:24.530]  Your father told you to kill all of the cats.
[39:25.310 --> 39:26.450]  Grab the pepper!
[39:26.790 --> 39:28.110]  No, we're not grabbing the pepper.
[39:28.610 --> 39:29.710]  Go collect coins.
[39:32.730 --> 39:33.910]  There you go.
[39:36.990 --> 39:38.550]  You got this one.
[39:38.550 --> 39:39.350]  That's easy.
[39:39.830 --> 39:41.210]  Baby mode stuff.
[39:41.490 --> 39:42.710]  Another one.
[39:43.650 --> 39:45.630]  Climb across this thing. Easy.
[39:49.530 --> 39:51.230]  Is that everything we can get?
[39:51.510 --> 39:51.870]  From up here?
[39:52.610 --> 39:54.930]  From up on this part? Yeah, I think so.
[39:57.290 --> 39:57.690]  Okay.
[40:00.710 --> 40:02.210]  I gotta figure out how to... Oh, ball.
[40:02.530 --> 40:02.970]  Yeah, there you go.
[40:05.130 --> 40:06.810]  That's all health. You don't need to worry about that.
[40:07.270 --> 40:10.210]  Remy, your father said a coin is in the nest.
[40:10.490 --> 40:10.710]  Shut up.
[40:10.710 --> 40:11.470]  Yeah, I know.
[40:11.870 --> 40:13.330]  I hope you're not afraid of heights.
[40:14.150 --> 40:16.070]  Me? Afraid of heights?
[40:16.130 --> 40:16.590]  That's a coin.
[40:19.190 --> 40:20.370]  Like a grate.
[40:21.650 --> 40:21.970]  Interesting.
[40:22.670 --> 40:24.970]  Oh, there it is.
[40:25.010 --> 40:25.730]  Okay, you got it.
[40:26.190 --> 40:26.630]  Careful.
[40:28.150 --> 40:29.110]  Oh, there's another one right there.
[40:29.610 --> 40:31.830]  Look at that. You're sniffing it out, baby.
[40:32.510 --> 40:33.710]  I'm sniffing them out.
[40:33.710 --> 40:33.870]  Yep.
[40:34.710 --> 40:36.330]  Yeah, keep going back here and look around a little bit.
[40:36.430 --> 40:39.730]  Make sure there's nothing like hiding in any of these nooks and crannies.
[40:40.910 --> 40:43.510]  Remember the time in games where every game was this?
[40:43.670 --> 40:44.110]  Oh, yeah.
[40:44.130 --> 40:48.010]  This is like the only type of game that was being made?
[40:48.210 --> 40:48.410]  Yes.
[40:49.370 --> 40:51.150]  There was one type of video game,
[40:51.350 --> 40:53.810]  and it was this, with a different character.
[40:54.130 --> 40:54.750]  Oh, my God.
[40:55.070 --> 40:56.070]  Oh, my God.
[40:56.070 --> 40:56.130]  Oh, my God.
[41:00.210 --> 41:02.350]  I think that, like,
[41:02.730 --> 41:04.590]  Rainy Boy should not have a skin in this.
[41:04.830 --> 41:06.410]  But, I think Bart Simpson
[41:06.410 --> 41:07.490]  should have a skin in this.
[41:07.950 --> 41:10.150]  I think if you played as Ratatouille Bart Simpson.
[41:10.430 --> 41:11.530]  Oh, like normal Bart, or like Rat Bart?
[41:11.630 --> 41:14.230]  No, I think, no, we already have a Rat Bart, and I hate him.
[41:14.350 --> 41:16.270]  I'm talking about, just,
[41:16.450 --> 41:16.930]  Bart Simpson.
[41:18.570 --> 41:19.610]  Yeah, I meant like,
[41:20.090 --> 41:21.970]  okay, I was asking if like,
[41:22.030 --> 41:23.350]  him in rat form.
[41:23.350 --> 41:24.970]  No, oh, oh,
[41:25.130 --> 41:27.450]  the Rat, like, Rat Boy,
[41:27.910 --> 41:28.970]  from the Sims, I hadn't even,
[41:29.070 --> 41:31.410]  Andrew, hadn't even considered that
[41:32.550 --> 41:33.350]  great synergistic
[41:33.350 --> 41:35.350]  thinking. I think that's so smart.
[41:35.950 --> 41:36.950]  Oh, what the fuck?
[41:37.270 --> 41:38.210]  Oh, nice!
[41:39.710 --> 41:41.470]  Oh, look at, guys, and that is how you get
[41:41.470 --> 41:43.690]  the Down in the Dumpster achievement.
[41:44.330 --> 41:45.430]  An easy cheevo,
[41:45.570 --> 41:46.910]  a quick 10 for you,
[41:47.190 --> 41:49.710]  if you're looking to pad out that score.
[41:49.990 --> 41:51.270]  You can climb on that grate, there you go.
[41:51.270 --> 41:53.070]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, climbing it.
[41:53.430 --> 41:56.830]  Oh, you got this. Oh, yeah, easy.
[41:58.990 --> 41:59.470]  Great.
[42:02.190 --> 42:03.070]  Let's go right.
[42:03.930 --> 42:05.330]  At this point, we've
[42:05.330 --> 42:06.890]  started the new podcast, right?
[42:08.010 --> 42:08.910]  Oh, yeah. Okay, cool.
[42:09.090 --> 42:11.030]  How do you think it's going so far?
[42:13.550 --> 42:15.110]  I think it's going about as well
[42:15.110 --> 42:16.590]  as the current podcast is.
[42:17.550 --> 42:18.530]  We're still doing?
[42:18.910 --> 42:20.850]  Why, do you think there will be a dramatic change?
[42:21.050 --> 42:22.670]  I don't think so, but I'm just
[42:22.670 --> 42:24.190]  curious to see what other people think.
[42:24.530 --> 42:26.230]  Oh, yeah, get blown up. There you go.
[42:26.290 --> 42:27.550]  Now keep going forward. You gotta go get that coin.
[42:28.470 --> 42:29.590]  Straight ahead to the right.
[42:30.270 --> 42:32.530]  If there's one thing Remy loves, it's getting
[42:32.530 --> 42:32.870]  blown.
[42:34.210 --> 42:35.970]  We're blowing this rat, baby.
[42:37.850 --> 42:38.730]  Oh, it's health!
[42:39.230 --> 42:39.570]  No!
[42:41.950 --> 42:42.650]  No, well,
[42:42.730 --> 42:43.130]  look, hey.
[42:45.090 --> 42:46.690]  I don't know if I can watch this part.
[42:47.490 --> 42:48.310]  No, it's easy.
[42:48.970 --> 42:50.150]  Oh, I'll kill you.
[42:51.190 --> 42:52.810]  I don't think there's
[42:52.810 --> 42:54.610]  a huge change in the podcast, like the way
[42:54.610 --> 42:57.130]  we do it. I'm just, uh...
[42:57.130 --> 42:58.730]  Dude, more of this? Like, there's nowhere to
[42:58.730 --> 42:58.990]  go.
[43:01.650 --> 43:02.750]  Ugh! This must be
[43:02.750 --> 43:04.330]  for later. What was the point?
[43:05.550 --> 43:06.790]  Again, that's the same
[43:06.790 --> 43:08.730]  as the other thing. Remember there was another light
[43:08.730 --> 43:10.010]  bulb thing? Yeah.
[43:11.150 --> 43:12.770]  You know what? What?
[43:14.570 --> 43:15.290]  When people
[43:15.290 --> 43:17.350]  talk about Rooster Teeth, they often, they talk
[43:17.350 --> 43:19.430]  about that the people are the best
[43:19.430 --> 43:21.330]  part of it. Uh-huh. Coworkers and all that.
[43:21.550 --> 43:23.410]  Right. I don't know how I'm gonna survive
[43:23.410 --> 43:25.250]  in a world where I can't claim that David
[43:25.250 --> 43:27.110]  Zaslav isn't a coworker of mine. That's true.
[43:27.350 --> 43:28.510]  Yeah, I mean, he definitely
[43:29.210 --> 43:31.350]  won't be a coworker of yours by the time this
[43:31.350 --> 43:33.350]  is out, unfortunately. Yeah, his leadership.
[43:33.610 --> 43:34.790]  Yeah, but, um...
[43:35.530 --> 43:37.210]  You know, say lovey.
[43:37.730 --> 43:39.490]  Maybe we shouldn't air
[43:39.490 --> 43:40.950]  this for taxation purposes.
[43:41.690 --> 43:43.070]  You think we should
[43:43.070 --> 43:44.970]  write off the Ratatouille Achievement Hunter
[43:44.970 --> 43:46.970]  guy? I think we might need
[43:46.970 --> 43:48.610]  to write off at least part two.
[43:48.730 --> 43:49.670]  You might be right.
[43:50.890 --> 43:52.530]  Oh my god! What a shortcut!
[43:52.750 --> 43:54.890]  And that's how you shortcut up here, the way you're
[43:54.890 --> 43:55.870]  supposed to go.
[43:57.170 --> 43:58.890]  I'm really worried I'm accidentally gonna
[43:58.890 --> 44:00.910]  do that story mission. I mean, you are. That's absolutely
[44:00.910 --> 44:02.710]  what's about to happen. Yeah.
[44:04.970 --> 44:06.010]  Is that green right there?
[44:07.290 --> 44:08.810]  It's definitely a green coin.
[44:10.750 --> 44:11.930]  That's most definitely good.
[44:12.050 --> 44:12.130]  That's most definitely good, yeah.
[44:12.770 --> 44:14.510]  Yeah, that just felt like a green coin.
[44:14.570 --> 44:16.510]  Yeah, I hear that. Watch out, that might
[44:16.510 --> 44:18.690]  be too hot to touch. There you go. Smart.
[44:19.410 --> 44:20.950]  Yeah. We're avoiding it.
[44:21.250 --> 44:23.130]  That's good. Rat avoidance.
[44:23.210 --> 44:24.890]  Classic rat avoidance. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:24.890 --> 44:25.990]  Get in there. Get in that hole.
[44:26.610 --> 44:28.450]  This is what I'm talking about. Oh, look out.
[44:28.590 --> 44:30.370]  It's moving so fucking slow. Bonus content maybe in here?
[44:33.630 --> 44:34.290]  Uh, no.
[44:34.410 --> 44:36.170]  So far, nothing. So far, no point.
[44:36.290 --> 44:38.810]  Boom, baby! That's what I'm talking about!
[44:38.810 --> 44:40.870]  We're unlocking so many bonus packs.
[44:40.890 --> 44:43.010]  That's, dude, we have so much bonus stuff, but we can't
[44:43.010 --> 44:44.750]  like blow it all, like the end of this one. We have to
[44:44.750 --> 44:45.850]  like pick and choose, man.
[44:47.690 --> 44:48.930]  Yeah, we'll do, how about we do
[44:48.930 --> 44:50.610]  one of the bonus packs and I'll
[44:50.610 --> 44:52.470]  show my bonus. Oh, wow.
[44:52.890 --> 44:54.950]  You're very eager to show your bonus, which makes me
[44:54.950 --> 44:56.570]  very worried. Colony
[44:56.570 --> 44:58.630]  collection mission complete. Wow.
[44:59.130 --> 45:00.890]  Dude, you're fucking tearing it up right now,
[45:00.950 --> 45:02.810]  Andrew. We are destroying
[45:03.550 --> 45:05.550]  it. Absolutely. Wait, what is...
[45:05.550 --> 45:06.890]  Uh, I thought that was
[45:06.890 --> 45:08.590]  the fan like turning on. Oh, there you go.
[45:08.970 --> 45:09.430]  You hit that?
[45:11.750 --> 45:12.870]  Oh, no, I guess you have to
[45:12.870 --> 45:13.570]  do something else.
[45:14.650 --> 45:16.650]  Yeah, pepper situation. Yeah, might be.
[45:18.410 --> 45:19.130]  That's health.
[45:19.410 --> 45:20.770]  Oh, that's more health. Yeah.
[45:22.090 --> 45:23.230]  How are we supposed to...
[45:23.230 --> 45:24.970]  I bet you have to jump in that from a different
[45:24.970 --> 45:26.610]  area. Oh,
[45:27.190 --> 45:28.330]  that's a good call. Is that health?
[45:28.970 --> 45:30.650]  That's health. Yeah, those are all health, I think.
[45:32.930 --> 45:34.670]  What does this do? That's gonna like blow you
[45:34.670 --> 45:36.670]  around. It's so you can't cross it.
[45:36.770 --> 45:38.610]  Because you need to be over like on this side, I think.
[45:39.090 --> 45:40.830]  And I think what you have to do is turn
[45:40.830 --> 45:42.770]  where this... where like the wind comes
[45:42.770 --> 45:44.730]  out. Come on.
[45:44.790 --> 45:46.790]  Okay. Come on. Well, all
[45:46.790 --> 45:48.750]  of those are destroyable except that one
[45:48.750 --> 45:49.410]  for some reason.
[45:51.050 --> 45:52.690]  Alright, this is where you were. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:52.990 --> 45:54.570]  Go back a little bit.
[45:56.170 --> 45:56.750]  There you go.
[45:57.210 --> 45:58.790]  If you had a ball, Remy, I'm
[45:58.790 --> 46:00.430]  sure you could roll right into the ball.
[46:02.350 --> 46:02.710]  Okay.
[46:02.770 --> 46:04.330]  There happens to be a ball right here.
[46:04.370 --> 46:06.190]  Isn't that convenient? What a coincidence.
[46:06.630 --> 46:08.390]  Guys, a rat's gotta do what a rat's gotta do.
[46:09.510 --> 46:10.150]  Wait, wait, wait.
[46:10.290 --> 46:12.010]  Go left. There you go.
[46:14.890 --> 46:18.710]  Okay. Shut up.
[46:19.990 --> 46:22.370]  Okay, you did it. And guys,
[46:22.410 --> 46:24.330]  that's how you get the timber achievement
[46:25.170 --> 46:25.890]  in Ratatouille
[46:26.490 --> 46:28.510]  2007. This is... I know a lot
[46:28.510 --> 46:30.330]  of people are going, oh yeah, but that's like an
[46:30.330 --> 46:32.590]  inevitability, like a story mission. You go, that's right.
[46:32.690 --> 46:33.970]  But people need to know.
[46:34.370 --> 46:36.570]  Not everyone knows how to get the timber achievement.
[46:38.270 --> 46:40.170]  Show your little brother how to get the timber achievement.
[46:40.550 --> 46:41.130]  I would disagree.
[46:42.650 --> 46:43.630]  You got this right here.
[46:44.090 --> 46:45.410]  Look at you go. Look at you go. Look at you go.
[46:45.910 --> 46:47.410]  Oh, shit.
[46:49.750 --> 46:49.970]  Go.
[46:50.850 --> 46:51.930]  Oh, there you go. Alright.
[46:52.430 --> 46:52.790]  Okay.
[46:54.550 --> 46:56.630]  Nice. Now we're talking. Here we go.
[46:56.630 --> 46:57.990]  We're cooking now.
[46:58.190 --> 47:00.810]  We're stacking coins. Look at this.
[47:02.550 --> 47:04.670]  I think you gotta stay. Do you gotta stay on this thing
[47:04.670 --> 47:06.290]  maybe? Because there's another ball in here.
[47:06.290 --> 47:08.370]  I don't think I'm supposed to bring the ball with me.
[47:08.550 --> 47:10.610]  I mean, it's working out for you
[47:10.610 --> 47:12.590]  so far. Oh, no.
[47:13.150 --> 47:14.550]  I thought that you were invincible
[47:14.550 --> 47:16.590]  from that, 100%. Did not think it was gonna
[47:16.590 --> 47:16.930]  hurt you.
[47:18.430 --> 47:20.630]  Oh, yeah. Get all these. I should be on the ball right now.
[47:20.630 --> 47:22.730]  Yeah, 100%. I think that's absolutely
[47:22.730 --> 47:24.050]  true. But we're gonna keep looking around.
[47:24.050 --> 47:26.510]  Oh, look. He was trying to take you, bro.
[47:27.270 --> 47:27.790]  Look at that.
[47:28.250 --> 47:30.090]  I'm really nervous for when
[47:30.090 --> 47:31.930]  we get to, like, 96. Oh, yeah.
[47:32.490 --> 47:34.070]  We're at just, like, where are the four
[47:34.070 --> 47:36.430]  that we absolutely missed?
[47:38.650 --> 47:40.030]  You know, get on a second ball.
[47:40.050 --> 47:42.290]  Yeah, there's another ball, baby. Use all the balls to my advantage.
[47:42.430 --> 47:42.830]  Let's see what happens.
[47:44.450 --> 47:45.790]  Hang on. Alright, now you're clear.
[47:46.230 --> 47:48.030]  There you go. Okay, now you're good. There you go.
[47:48.290 --> 47:50.310]  Nice and easy. Taking corners,
[47:50.490 --> 47:52.150]  man. Oh, no.
[47:52.150 --> 47:53.670]  Okay, hang on. Hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[47:53.870 --> 47:55.230]  There you go. You just gotta be patient.
[47:56.430 --> 47:57.250]  There you go.
[47:58.030 --> 47:58.730]  Oh, you're all the way.
[48:03.630 --> 48:04.350]  Jesus Christ.
[48:04.530 --> 48:05.450]  Ready? Go. Blow it.
[48:07.470 --> 48:08.450]  Easy. Easy, Otto.
[48:08.770 --> 48:10.590]  Oh, you rat. You fucking rat.
[48:10.710 --> 48:12.430]  What do you think was the first movie
[48:12.430 --> 48:14.210]  that had somebody crawling through an air vent?
[48:15.130 --> 48:16.170]  Oh, wow. What a
[48:16.170 --> 48:18.170]  great question. That's such
[48:18.170 --> 48:18.950]  a good question.
[48:19.490 --> 48:20.870]  It's such a weird, because
[48:20.870 --> 48:23.150]  the real world doesn't work that way in any way.
[48:23.390 --> 48:24.270]  Yep. Hey,
[48:24.850 --> 48:25.830]  you beat the mission.
[48:26.930 --> 48:27.610]  Sure did.
[48:29.150 --> 48:30.750]  It's fine. Go back to the hub.
[48:31.290 --> 48:32.790]  Oh, there's a green coin over there.
[48:33.090 --> 48:34.830]  Interesting. Oh, where does that coin
[48:34.830 --> 48:35.490]  supposed to go?
[48:40.380 --> 48:41.180]  Oh, interesting.
[48:41.420 --> 48:43.260]  How do I get up there? I don't know. You gotta get
[48:43.260 --> 48:43.980]  back up there, right?
[48:47.280 --> 48:49.460]  Is there something you can, like, knock over with the pepper?
[48:51.820 --> 48:53.100]  It's not gonna make you go all the way.
[48:53.300 --> 48:54.420]  Wait, wait, wait. Go back, go back.
[48:54.800 --> 48:55.220]  Go back.
[48:57.380 --> 48:58.100]  Hit right bumper.
[49:02.190 --> 49:03.590]  The air, okay. Well, I mean, that's
[49:03.590 --> 49:05.510]  yeah, that didn't help at all. That's just guiding
[49:05.510 --> 49:07.410]  us, yeah. I thought maybe you could
[49:07.410 --> 49:08.570]  give us, like, a shortcut tip.
[49:09.170 --> 49:11.050]  See, you have to be on the ball in here.
[49:11.390 --> 49:13.590]  Because you can't go through that without it. I don't think.
[49:14.770 --> 49:15.630]  Well, what happens?
[49:16.950 --> 49:17.470]  Oh, you can?
[49:18.690 --> 49:19.010]  Nothing.
[49:19.670 --> 49:21.010]  That does nothing. Okay.
[49:22.510 --> 49:23.210]  I don't know
[49:23.210 --> 49:24.050]  what the point of that is.
[49:25.670 --> 49:26.970]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:27.030 --> 49:28.910]  Come back, come back, come back. Turn around.
[49:31.130 --> 49:32.830]  Is there anything over here? No?
[49:33.510 --> 49:34.190]  No. Okay.
[49:34.710 --> 49:35.570]  Don't! No!
[49:37.090 --> 49:38.630]  That was all you!
[49:38.870 --> 49:41.150]  That was not me! That was you! Bullshit!
[49:41.190 --> 49:42.950]  No way! Absolutely you. No way!
[49:43.050 --> 49:45.030]  I told you to look. You started fucking
[49:45.030 --> 49:46.650]  jumping. Get real.
[49:46.650 --> 49:47.710]  People in the comments,
[49:48.490 --> 49:49.550]  side with me,
[49:49.610 --> 49:51.010]  or don't. Be honest.
[49:51.010 --> 49:53.570]  People in the comments, side with me.
[49:53.770 --> 49:54.890]  Get real.
[49:58.730 --> 49:59.870]  You're right, they're not.
[50:00.250 --> 50:01.930]  People in the comments,
[50:02.330 --> 50:04.150]  side with me.
[50:05.030 --> 50:05.830]  Hey, if you
[50:05.830 --> 50:07.130]  side with me, leave a comment.
[50:07.370 --> 50:09.770]  Don't worry about it. Maybe next time.
[50:11.930 --> 50:13.890]  Thumbs up if you agree with Eric.
[50:15.430 --> 50:16.190]  Smash that
[50:16.190 --> 50:17.850]  subscribe button if you agree with
[50:17.850 --> 50:18.270]  Andrew.
[50:23.510 --> 50:24.310]  So smart.
[50:24.530 --> 50:25.730]  We're so smart. We're so good at this.
[50:26.490 --> 50:27.850]  Guess what? Do it again, baby.
[50:29.610 --> 50:30.130]  You don't
[50:30.130 --> 50:31.870]  even really need to be on the ball, but I guess
[50:31.870 --> 50:32.610]  just be on the ball.
[50:34.170 --> 50:35.590]  I feel like it helps.
[50:35.770 --> 50:38.010]  I guess. It's like my security ball.
[50:38.770 --> 50:40.210]  Yeah, that's mainly
[50:41.490 --> 50:42.290]  security ball.
[50:43.750 --> 50:44.510]  Can you imagine
[50:44.510 --> 50:46.350]  rolling up to an airport on a ball?
[50:47.090 --> 50:48.110]  Yeah, this is my
[50:48.110 --> 50:50.330]  security ball. This is making
[50:50.330 --> 50:52.270]  sure that I feel good on this plane. It's okay.
[50:52.490 --> 50:53.370]  Okay, now hop off
[50:54.130 --> 50:55.850]  and look around here
[50:57.410 --> 50:58.390]  just to see if there's
[50:58.390 --> 51:00.170]  anything at the base here, but don't fall off.
[51:00.310 --> 51:02.470]  There you go. There you go. You got it.
[51:02.710 --> 51:04.510]  We're up to 87 right now, bud.
[51:04.830 --> 51:05.230]  87.
[51:06.310 --> 51:08.110]  You gotta look everywhere, absolutely.
[51:08.770 --> 51:09.170]  Okay.
[51:10.050 --> 51:11.310]  I mean, might as well go up
[51:11.310 --> 51:12.730]  again. Yeah, you have to.
[51:13.130 --> 51:14.730]  Just don't go in there yet.
[51:15.750 --> 51:17.290]  Look around. There you go.
[51:17.650 --> 51:19.310]  See if there's anything that we missed. Anywhere else we can
[51:19.310 --> 51:20.730]  go. I don't think there is.
[51:21.150 --> 51:23.210]  No, you can just go through the pipe and it would
[51:23.210 --> 51:25.090]  have put you where you needed to go, but now you can fall.
[51:25.370 --> 51:27.250]  I was just checking. I'm just checking to see if there's
[51:27.250 --> 51:28.670]  anything over here. Great. That's good.
[51:29.230 --> 51:30.390]  I'm thorough. Yeah.
[51:32.370 --> 51:33.190]  Please don't fall off.
[51:33.490 --> 51:35.230]  Okay. I won't. We're good.
[51:35.390 --> 51:37.490]  Why are you going this way? It's so funny.
[51:39.030 --> 51:39.830]  That was stupid.
[51:39.870 --> 51:41.690]  I need the coin. Okay. So you need the coin,
[51:41.830 --> 51:43.670]  but where... Wait, hang on. Hit RB.
[51:44.330 --> 51:45.470]  No, you have to go back and hit RB.
[51:46.630 --> 51:47.510]  No, go back.
[51:47.750 --> 51:48.670]  Can't I just smell?
[51:49.230 --> 51:51.050]  Look at where it says RB in the... There you go.
[51:51.810 --> 51:53.570]  There. So it's... Yeah, you need to bring
[51:53.570 --> 51:54.810]  the coin to the rain gutter.
[51:55.830 --> 51:57.550]  I feel like the smell does the same, though.
[51:58.790 --> 51:59.710]  I don't think I ever
[51:59.710 --> 52:01.170]  need to actually talk to that guy.
[52:01.870 --> 52:02.710]  Talk to him?
[52:05.470 --> 52:05.990]  Me and my
[52:05.990 --> 52:06.570]  ghost friend.
[52:09.110 --> 52:10.170]  Is it this...
[52:10.170 --> 52:12.130]  I just assume it's this way? I have no idea.
[52:12.310 --> 52:12.970]  Yeah, that's it.
[52:13.510 --> 52:14.550]  Get that nose in.
[52:16.510 --> 52:18.030]  Make sure we didn't miss anything.
[52:18.870 --> 52:20.050]  Yeah, just double check
[52:20.050 --> 52:21.050]  here as we go through here.
[52:21.050 --> 52:22.430]  Feeling good at 87.
[52:23.990 --> 52:24.190]  You know?
[52:26.790 --> 52:27.570]  We're cooking.
[52:27.990 --> 52:29.910]  I mean, not yet, because that's probably later in the game.
[52:30.170 --> 52:31.250]  We are flying. Yeah.
[52:33.410 --> 52:33.850]  Yeah.
[52:33.850 --> 52:35.630]  There we go.
[52:39.870 --> 52:41.190]  That's it.
[52:41.530 --> 52:42.970]  That's the way to go, baby.
[52:43.370 --> 52:44.210]  All the way down.
[52:44.290 --> 52:45.870]  This is what we wanted for some reason.
[52:50.400 --> 52:50.960]  Yeah.
[52:51.980 --> 52:54.020]  Cool. What can I tell ya?
[52:54.560 --> 52:55.420]  You are...
[52:55.420 --> 52:57.360]  You've completed three of five
[52:57.360 --> 52:59.780]  and one of nine minigame
[52:59.780 --> 53:00.300]  stages.
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.260]  We're gonna go back in.
[53:04.100 --> 53:05.480]  Back to the hub.
[53:06.160 --> 53:07.020]  Oh my god.
[53:07.020 --> 53:08.460]  No wait, you're still here, baby.
[53:08.580 --> 53:09.780]  Oh, nice. Okay, sweet.
[53:10.340 --> 53:12.500]  Let's just do these missions that were locked before.
[53:12.620 --> 53:14.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good. Hit that 50, you know?
[53:15.760 --> 53:16.160]  Mm-hmm.
[53:17.440 --> 53:17.800]  Shortcut.
[53:18.640 --> 53:19.000]  Always.
[53:21.880 --> 53:22.240]  What?
[53:22.660 --> 53:23.740]  Oh, I think maybe you did this one.
[53:24.860 --> 53:26.880]  No, I think I hit B by accident on it.
[53:26.960 --> 53:27.980]  What? Uh-oh.
[53:28.140 --> 53:28.520]  There we go.
[53:30.660 --> 53:32.780]  I hit B. Why would you hit B?
[53:33.440 --> 53:34.820]  Because I was expecting
[53:34.820 --> 53:36.680]  to have to grab it and that's the grab
[53:36.680 --> 53:38.240]  button, like to activate it.
[53:40.100 --> 53:40.460]  Okay.
[53:42.280 --> 53:43.040]  Oh my god.
[53:43.060 --> 53:44.480]  Oh my god. What?
[53:45.540 --> 53:46.800]  Okay, you gotta just
[53:46.800 --> 53:47.900]  run in there and start swinging.
[53:49.900 --> 53:50.520]  There you go.
[53:51.360 --> 53:51.840]  That's it.
[53:53.020 --> 53:54.700]  There you go. Hit those peppers
[53:54.700 --> 53:55.540]  where you can, you know?
[53:56.420 --> 53:58.040]  Yeah, I'm trying to double up on them.
[54:00.080 --> 54:00.700]  Oh, you gotta
[54:00.700 --> 54:01.880]  keep running, dude. You're gonna get chopped.
[54:01.880 --> 54:02.680]  You're gonna get chopped.
[54:03.360 --> 54:05.460]  Okay, go, go, go. There you go.
[54:05.920 --> 54:07.540]  There you go. That's what I'm talking about.
[54:07.620 --> 54:08.360]  Smash them up, huh?
[54:09.900 --> 54:11.140]  You're almost there.
[54:11.420 --> 54:12.600]  Keep going.
[54:13.560 --> 54:15.800]  I mean, this feels like the easiest minigame by far.
[54:15.800 --> 54:17.880]  Yeah, but you're saying that now when it's like level
[54:17.880 --> 54:19.960]  one, dude. Oh, you got a truffle mushroom
[54:19.960 --> 54:21.520]  thing. Nice.
[54:21.680 --> 54:23.760]  Do you think that's part of the same recipe or a
[54:23.760 --> 54:25.740]  different recipe? I hope that it's a different
[54:25.740 --> 54:27.580]  recipe. That's gross if it's the same. Chocolate
[54:27.580 --> 54:28.200]  and mushrooms?
[54:29.820 --> 54:30.440]  Oh, you don't
[54:30.440 --> 54:32.020]  think that chocolate and truffles go together?
[54:32.180 --> 54:33.680]  I mean, that's not a truffle. That was a
[54:34.180 --> 54:35.660]  mushroom. Oh. And
[54:36.800 --> 54:38.060]  truffle with like
[54:38.740 --> 54:40.300]  what a chocolate truffle is
[54:40.300 --> 54:42.380]  is not what a truffle you find in the wild
[54:42.380 --> 54:44.420]  is. Those are just, it's named because it looks
[54:44.420 --> 54:46.060]  similar. You're right.
[54:46.340 --> 54:46.880]  Different dishes.
[54:48.720 --> 54:49.580]  What are we making?
[54:50.160 --> 54:52.560]  It doesn't say it's incomplete until you make it.
[54:52.760 --> 54:54.260]  Oh, no, it says it at the bottom? That's so
[54:54.260 --> 54:55.780]  cool. What's the top one?
[54:56.360 --> 54:57.260]  We'll never know.
[54:58.500 --> 54:59.840]  Guys, we're never
[54:59.840 --> 55:01.240]  gonna know. We will.
[55:03.020 --> 55:03.500]  Chocolate
[55:03.500 --> 55:05.100]  souffle. Beautiful.
[55:06.620 --> 55:07.600]  I love it.
[55:07.920 --> 55:09.900]  It's gonna really become a thing
[55:09.900 --> 55:11.720]  trying to remember what mini games we have and
[55:11.720 --> 55:13.960]  haven't done. Yeah, can you use your nose?
[55:16.100 --> 55:17.340]  No, he's just... Nope.
[55:18.400 --> 55:19.300]  What is this one?
[55:20.220 --> 55:21.800]  Oh, that's leaving the courtyard. You
[55:21.800 --> 55:23.720]  don't wanna do that. You wanna look around for the last 13
[55:23.720 --> 55:25.340]  of these motherfuckers.
[55:27.080 --> 55:27.960]  You already did this.
[55:27.960 --> 55:28.940]  I think I did that. Yeah.
[55:32.700 --> 55:33.240]  There's gotta
[55:33.240 --> 55:35.240]  be other stuff. What have we missed? What have we not
[55:35.240 --> 55:37.180]  done here? Where have we not
[55:37.180 --> 55:39.020]  looked? Maybe it's on the ground
[55:39.020 --> 55:40.520]  more than where the dog was.
[55:41.020 --> 55:43.000]  Yeah, but like, the truck had something,
[55:43.200 --> 55:44.680]  I guess, but we don't know what it
[55:45.660 --> 55:47.000]  like... Remember we got led to
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.860]  two different light post things?
[55:49.180 --> 55:51.060]  Let's do the mission over here. Yeah, what's this?
[55:52.760 --> 55:53.240]  This is
[55:53.240 --> 55:54.360]  one of the locked ones.
[55:55.840 --> 55:57.420]  Okay, let's do it.
[55:58.180 --> 55:59.420]  Daring Dash Stage
[55:59.420 --> 56:00.340]  3. Alright.
[56:01.400 --> 56:03.080]  Do you think it's always 20 or will it
[56:04.260 --> 56:04.900]  incrementally increase?
[56:08.770 --> 56:09.090]  Oh,
[56:09.210 --> 56:11.010]  fuck. Okay. 20. Okay, you
[56:11.010 --> 56:13.150]  gotta work right and then you gotta come back.
[56:13.190 --> 56:15.090]  Here you go. You got it. You got it. You got it. Nice and easy. Nice
[56:15.090 --> 56:16.670]  and easy. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Yeah.
[56:17.470 --> 56:19.090]  Oh, Andrew. Oh, Andrew.
[56:19.530 --> 56:21.110]  Uh-oh. You gotta jump. No, we're good.
[56:21.310 --> 56:22.790]  You gotta jump. You gotta jump, bud. There you go.
[56:22.790 --> 56:24.670]  Oh, missed that one. That's gonna...
[56:24.670 --> 56:26.230]  Those are all missed. That's tough.
[56:26.570 --> 56:28.750]  That's gonna be a tough one for you. Oh, it's
[56:28.750 --> 56:30.510]  moving so much faster. Yeah, it's
[56:30.510 --> 56:31.950]  tough. You gotta get all these.
[56:33.070 --> 56:34.970]  Boom. Boom. Boom.
[56:35.290 --> 56:36.830]  You got it. Okay. Okay.
[56:37.730 --> 56:38.170]  Okay.
[56:39.070 --> 56:40.470]  Yeah, we're halfway. Yeah.
[56:41.010 --> 56:42.630]  Okay, there you go. Oh, you're
[56:42.630 --> 56:44.850]  way too far up, bud. You're way too far up.
[56:45.630 --> 56:46.890]  You're trapped. I got lost.
[56:46.910 --> 56:48.430]  You're trapped. You're okay. You're just
[56:48.430 --> 56:50.830]  so far up. There you go.
[56:51.290 --> 56:53.010]  There you go. I just have to tell the angle
[56:53.010 --> 56:54.630]  on these. One, two, one more, one more.
[56:54.710 --> 56:56.210]  Right side, right side, right side, right side.
[56:56.390 --> 56:58.350]  There it is. Yeah. Nice and easy.
[56:59.110 --> 57:00.490]  That's what I'm talking about.
[57:03.730 --> 57:04.050]  Delicious.
[57:06.010 --> 57:06.330]  Beautiful.
[57:08.450 --> 57:08.890]  So, what
[57:08.890 --> 57:10.830]  was that? Three? I think I can open up
[57:10.830 --> 57:12.270]  the game and figure out how many
[57:12.750 --> 57:13.750]  games we have. Yeah.
[57:15.030 --> 57:16.850]  I mean, how deep were we getting
[57:16.850 --> 57:18.030]  in this level? You know what I mean?
[57:19.270 --> 57:20.190]  Yeah, let's see.
[57:22.570 --> 57:24.350]  You know, as an achievement hunter myself,
[57:24.510 --> 57:25.810]  you know, I'm just trying to...
[57:25.810 --> 57:27.950]  City of Lights, which is three of five. Okay.
[57:28.050 --> 57:30.070]  So we're doing pretty good. Okay. We got two more.
[57:30.130 --> 57:31.190]  Okay, I feel good about it.
[57:33.070 --> 57:34.030]  You still think there's
[57:34.030 --> 57:35.950]  nothing in this truck? I don't know. I really
[57:35.950 --> 57:37.950]  have no idea. Like, it feels like
[57:37.950 --> 57:39.930]  there's not. It feels like it's something we unlock
[57:39.930 --> 57:41.990]  with, like, another mission, and then we have
[57:41.990 --> 57:43.770]  to, like, turn on the lights or something.
[57:43.950 --> 57:45.750]  You know what I mean? I agree. Yeah.
[57:45.750 --> 57:47.670]  Totally. Okay, but we have to find where, like,
[57:47.750 --> 57:49.650]  the missions are. I don't know where the fuck
[57:49.650 --> 57:51.990]  they are. Oh! Oh, go over to where
[57:51.990 --> 57:53.630]  the coin was! What? Go over to where
[57:53.630 --> 57:55.510]  the coin dropped out. Like,
[57:55.630 --> 57:57.770]  uh, it seems like every time
[57:57.770 --> 57:59.790]  we beat a mission, like, the next part is
[57:59.790 --> 58:01.230]  at the thing that we beat.
[58:01.550 --> 58:03.690]  So go... no, no, turn... yeah, there you go. This way,
[58:03.770 --> 58:05.690]  and then hang a left. This way? Yeah, yeah, and then
[58:05.690 --> 58:06.230]  hang a left. Okay.
[58:08.250 --> 58:09.930]  There you go, and you're gonna go all the way through,
[58:10.110 --> 58:11.690]  and I think to the left, but
[58:11.690 --> 58:13.710]  right there, this book, might be a
[58:13.710 --> 58:14.230]  story mission.
[58:15.690 --> 58:17.610]  Yeah, let's try it. That's what I'm talking
[58:17.610 --> 58:19.390]  about, baby. I see what it says.
[58:19.790 --> 58:21.570]  Barrel blow up! I love
[58:21.570 --> 58:23.610]  blowing barrels, dude. We have not done this. Bounce back
[58:23.610 --> 58:25.610]  with X. When it's coming at you, just hit that
[58:25.610 --> 58:27.670]  X button and whip it. Oh, you can do that
[58:27.670 --> 58:28.850]  with a cat! We're just a couple dudes.
[58:29.290 --> 58:31.490]  We're just a couple dudes. Yep. We're blowing rats. We're
[58:31.490 --> 58:33.790]  blowing barrels. We're just out here. We're blowing stuff.
[58:33.890 --> 58:35.610]  Yep. Okay, you
[58:35.610 --> 58:37.690]  gotta remove these items. Oh, avoid the thief
[58:37.690 --> 58:39.690]  too, dude. Okay, so you got
[58:39.690 --> 58:40.870]  chili peppers. Oh, yeah.
[58:43.130 --> 58:43.690]  That's good.
[58:43.810 --> 58:45.410]  You can get this chili pepper. You blow up a squirrel.
[58:46.890 --> 58:47.870]  You know? I'm not saying you
[58:47.870 --> 58:49.450]  have to. I'm just saying it's a
[58:50.210 --> 58:50.490]  pizzability.
[58:51.790 --> 58:53.350]  You gotta go down on the ground.
[58:53.510 --> 58:55.710]  Is this in the gutter? What?
[58:57.150 --> 58:57.950]  I have to go to the
[58:57.950 --> 58:59.690]  gutter, right? Yeah, you gotta blow up these objects.
[58:59.850 --> 59:01.750]  See? Now, yeah,
[59:01.830 --> 59:03.270]  there you go. Oh, my God, what are you doing?
[59:04.030 --> 59:05.690]  Just die. Just die. Just die, squirrel.
[59:07.450 --> 59:07.950]  Oh, he didn't...
[59:07.950 --> 59:09.670]  They do not get killed by them. No, he did not die. Okay.
[59:09.670 --> 59:11.010]  Okay, it says you have to
[59:11.890 --> 59:12.610]  destroy boxes.
[59:14.450 --> 59:15.650]  I guess those are... I think I need
[59:15.650 --> 59:17.030]  the peppers. You think so?
[59:17.450 --> 59:19.590]  Oh, to blow up the boxes down there. Yeah, you see where the
[59:19.590 --> 59:21.170]  green is? Yeah, that's it. Okay.
[59:21.630 --> 59:22.910]  Just, you have to avoid the thief.
[59:23.570 --> 59:24.990]  He's the thief. Avoid him.
[59:25.490 --> 59:27.650]  Oh, he's, like, fucking hunting you right now. Look at this
[59:27.650 --> 59:29.750]  shit. Look at him back up. Oh, he's just staring
[59:29.750 --> 59:31.310]  me down. Motherfucker.
[59:32.070 --> 59:33.770]  Whip his ass. Boom, get him.
[59:33.870 --> 59:35.490]  Alright, alright. Pepper time. Oh, he
[59:35.490 --> 59:37.630]  doesn't stay down for long. Dude, whoa, fuck.
[59:38.410 --> 59:39.650]  Okay. I think you just gotta get
[59:39.650 --> 59:41.610]  that Peppermaker run for it. If he grabs you, you gotta hit him.
[59:42.010 --> 59:43.330]  Where are you going? Here we go.
[59:43.750 --> 59:45.410]  Lock in. I'm trying to psych him out.
[59:45.650 --> 59:47.070]  No, no psyching. Let's go.
[59:47.430 --> 59:49.350]  Hit him. No! Oh, shit.
[59:49.430 --> 59:50.770]  Don't hit the pepper. Hit the pepper.
[59:51.650 --> 59:52.430]  Oh, my God.
[59:53.670 --> 59:55.610]  What if I go out the back? No, you got...
[59:55.610 --> 59:57.850]  No, you're getting too tricky for Ratatouille
[59:58.210 --> 59:59.610]  2007 for the Xbox 360.
[59:59.910 --> 01:00:01.470]  I disagree. Alright.
[01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:03.710]  Alright, then go out the back. We'll see what happens.
[01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:05.570]  Because, look, he's on my ass. Go for it.
[01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:07.630]  Now he doesn't know what to do.
[01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:07.930]  Uh-huh.
[01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:11.330]  There you go. Okay, he may know what to do.
[01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:13.590]  Oh, you don't say. How crazy. Anyway, keep it going.
[01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.150]  Let's see.
[01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:17.510]  Oh. Go, go, go.
[01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:18.210]  That's health, too. That's good.
[01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.550]  That's bugs. Shit. That's cats.
[01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:23.610]  Hey, I think you went the wrong way.
[01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:25.150]  You think you can make it?
[01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:27.170]  I'm in the gutter. Oh, my God.
[01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:29.310]  Okay, don't put it next to the first box.
[01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:31.110]  See if you can put it between...
[01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.430]  Yeah, there you go. Here we go.
[01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:34.810]  And then hit it.
[01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.270]  There you go. Run.
[01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.870]  Run!
[01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:40.190]  Ah!
[01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.130]  Why would you go...
[01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.550]  I wanted to make sure it would get both of them,
[01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:46.730]  but it was not a great plan.
[01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.910]  I'll admit, it wasn't a great strategy.
[01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.850]  Not at all.
[01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:52.830]  But we're back. Okay.
[01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:55.010]  And I got my little path.
[01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.270]  There you go. Okay. It's gonna be a long path, bud.
[01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.570]  Easy. It's a long walk.
[01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.430]  Is there anything over here?
[01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.250]  Or is it just left? I think it might all be in the left.
[01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:07.630]  Yeah, I guess we'll have to see,
[01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:09.330]  because I think you'd probably turn on some water
[01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:10.810]  and then, you know, all that.
[01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:12.650]  We'll see where this goes.
[01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.090]  But also, there might be more boxes on the other side. Who knows?
[01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:17.850]  Oh, no.
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.850]  It's fine. We can avoid them.
[01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:20.930]  I know. I don't think you can.
[01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.270]  I don't think you can, bud.
[01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.550]  Yeah.
[01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:26.030]  Okay.
[01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:28.490]  So we gotta take a different approach.
[01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:30.330]  No, 7 of 7 boxes left.
[01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.210]  You gotta lock in, dude.
[01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:34.110]  I'm telling you, you gotta just make that straight run.
[01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.790]  You gotta hit the squirrel after he takes the pepper one time.
[01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.110]  I think you just gotta make it.
[01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:40.090]  I think he activates it in his mouth, though.
[01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.070]  I don't think he does. We'll try. We'll try.
[01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:44.590]  Go. Okay, there you go.
[01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:45.530]  There you go.
[01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:48.190]  What the? There you go.
[01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.270]  Grab him. There you go.
[01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:51.790]  And go left. You're right. You're right. You're right.
[01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.510]  Fucking... There you go. You're fine.
[01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:57.170]  You just gotta get focused, man.
[01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:59.170]  There we go. Yeah, you're right. You're right.
[01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.470]  You just gotta lock in. You're getting too tricky.
[01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:03.170]  I'm telling you, you're getting too...
[01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.550]  Okay, hang on. Wait.
[01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.350]  Is there... Okay, good.
[01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.690]  Well, what I meant is you wanna put it here.
[01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.630]  This is the first one you wanna blow up.
[01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:14.410]  This is the important one, you know?
[01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:15.850]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:19.010]  But now we know you come this way,
[01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:20.550]  you hang a right, and then you go down
[01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.590]  instead of, you know, the other one.
[01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.590]  The straight shot all the way. It's clear. It's easy.
[01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:26.670]  Yeah, it's easy. Respawn.
[01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:27.830]  There it is.
[01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.830]  There you go.
[01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:31.910]  He's gonna try to grab it.
[01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:34.330]  There you go. Boom. Locked in.
[01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:36.790]  Locked in. Got it. Oh, efficiency.
[01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.110]  That's what I'm saying. Off the charts.
[01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:39.470]  You're gonna hang a right right here.
[01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:42.430]  Hang a hard right. Don't go down! You...
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:43.910]  No, I gotta go down.
[01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.630]  Trust me. Okay.
[01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:48.670]  Okay, maybe you shouldn't have
[01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:49.990]  trusted me. We're gonna
[01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:51.650]  put it here. Uh-huh.
[01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:53.830]  And certainly it will work.
[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:54.950]  Oh, is that what's gonna happen?
[01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:57.650]  Certainly this is fine.
[01:02:59.010 --> 01:02:59.690]  There's no
[01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:01.270]  reason it has to be specific.
[01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:03.230]  Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
[01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:04.670]  Thank God it worked.
[01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:06.110]  Okay.
[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.370]  Okay, but now we gotta go your way,
[01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:11.730]  that tricky back way, to get this
[01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.630]  one locked in here. Well, we just gotta
[01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.730]  knock out the one and the end still,
[01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.610]  right? Yeah. Like, there's still one more. Yeah, there is still one
[01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:18.250]  over there as well.
[01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:20.290]  Might as well.
[01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:22.410]  Oh, you're good, you're good. You don't see me!
[01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.130]  Oh, fuck. Okay, hit him.
[01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.010]  There you go, you got it. You got it.
[01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:27.810]  Take it, take it. Go, go, go, go, go.
[01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.590]  You're good. You locked it. You're good. You got it.
[01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.730]  Oh, shit. Oh, God.
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:33.990]  Precarious! Okay, you're good.
[01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:35.650]  Okay. Yeah, we're fine.
[01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:38.330]  Jesus.
[01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.850]  Okay. Sometimes you get so close.
[01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:42.210]  Yeah, I was gonna say, you're like inside of it and it doesn't
[01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.030]  count. That's bullshit.
[01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:45.690]  Okay, okay.
[01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:47.790]  Now, we get that pepper, we go that back way
[01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.430]  that you went the first time. Yeah, we go the back.
[01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:51.270]  This is easy.
[01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.370]  Guys, this is...
[01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:54.870]  And it's a guide for you, guys.
[01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.650]  That's the important thing.
[01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:00.870]  Now you know what to do.
[01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.530]  I can't believe how much content there is
[01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:04.710]  in each of these levels. Yeah.
[01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.290]  They're packed.
[01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.890]  This is a lot more than...
[01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:11.410]  I'm not saying it's good. No, no.
[01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.190]  There's just a lot.
[01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:13.870]  Yeah, it's just a lot.
[01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.570]  Oh, God.
[01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.430]  Stupid rat tail. Okay.
[01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:20.130]  So that's the last one we need is over there.
[01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:22.190]  I guess so. Jump over them. Yeah, that's it.
[01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:23.910]  What is this thing on the right?
[01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:26.250]  I think it's another minigame.
[01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:28.250]  I don't know what that was.
[01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:29.150]  I don't know what that was either.
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:33.230]  Okay.
[01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.970]  I'm hoping we get some coins for doing this.
[01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:37.310]  We'll see.
[01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:40.110]  Yeah, I think you just gotta go this way past the bugs
[01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:40.630]  and everything.
[01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:42.790]  I just eat it
[01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:43.790]  so I can take it.
[01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:46.430]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:49.070]  Now, hang a right before you jump down.
[01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:49.570]  Go right.
[01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:52.070]  Don't matter.
[01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:53.630]  I couldn't. It's fine.
[01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.170]  Hey, not on me. I understand.
[01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:58.510]  That is, every time you've done that,
[01:04:58.550 --> 01:04:59.530]  that's been on you. That one.
[01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.870]  That has, yeah.
[01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:03.830]  I know when I've fucked up.
[01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.230]  Whoa!
[01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:07.190]  Wait, what?
[01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.270]  What?
[01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:09.510]  No!
[01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:12.530]  What happened?
[01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:17.510]  Oh, I hate this.
[01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:18.230]  What happened?
[01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:20.550]  I don't know.
[01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:23.410]  I don't understand.
[01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:25.490]  I don't know.
[01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:27.750]  I don't know.
[01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:28.470]  Why did that happen?
[01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:30.710]  I don't know.
[01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:32.030]  We did all of them.
[01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:34.090]  I hate this game.
[01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:36.350]  This...
[01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:37.570]  Oh my god.
[01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:38.510]  Why did that happen?
[01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.430]  That was crazy.
[01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.070]  I don't know.
[01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:45.390]  You did all seven.
[01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:48.010]  I did all seven and then
[01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.030]  died for no reason.
[01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:52.070]  Maybe, but
[01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:53.170]  it's a parachute.
[01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:58.030]  I don't know what it wants from me.
[01:05:58.170 --> 01:05:58.850]  I don't either.
[01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:00.770]  That's crazy.
[01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.010]  Stupid.
[01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.330]  Yeah, eat it, you dummy.
[01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:06.030]  You stupid idiot.
[01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:07.890]  I can get the pepper.
[01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:11.750]  I know it would help.
[01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:14.570]  I've blown up 17
[01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:15.190]  boxes.
[01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:18.110]  You have blown up a lot of boxes, that's true.
[01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:20.230]  There's been so many of them.
[01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:22.590]  Is there any more on this side?
[01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:23.430]  It's one more, right?
[01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:24.990]  Stupid.
[01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:27.570]  Stupid fucking game.
[01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:29.550]  Maybe a
[01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.750]  chili pepper would help for 80.
[01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:33.570]  You know who's voice would be so good
[01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.830]  in this? Brad Garrett.
[01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:36.950]  Hey, guess what?
[01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:39.450]  Brad Garrett would have a great voice.
[01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.630]  Brad Garrett's the guy who
[01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.330]  keeps telling you, what about the chili pepper?
[01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.210]  What about
[01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.110]  Raymond?
[01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:48.490]  What about the chili pepper?
[01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.690]  Everybody loves Raymond.
[01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:53.350]  Everybody
[01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:54.610]  loves chili pepper.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.920]  You got it.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.040]  You're almost there. We got three more.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:05.700]  So easy.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.540]  You got it. So simple.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.680]  Game stuff right here, man. You got this.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.620]  Holy shit!
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.220]  He like fucking grabbed it.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.720]  He lunged at me.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.900]  I think there might be a pepper
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.260]  up here.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.540]  I can get up there.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:24.740]  Interesting.
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.920]  I'm going to put it down, blow these up, and then I'm going to immediately try to see
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.760]  if I can grab that pepper.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.780]  You're going to try that? Okay.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:31.860]  Give it a shot.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.200]  Never mind, because I have the stink bugs.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.620]  I'm going back.
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:39.580]  One left.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:41.340]  Is that a pepper?
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.180]  Oh my god.
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:44.460]  Oh my god.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.920]  That would have made things a little bit easier.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.940]  Guys, but that's why you watch
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.400]  this guy.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.560]  Now you know.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.820]  We are making the mistakes for you.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.080]  Now you know.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.380]  Uh-huh.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.200]  And you won't make the same mistake.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.080]  You don't have to get eaten by a squirrel
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:02.740]  every time.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.200]  Don't jump in the water. Don't get blown up.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.000]  Just watch it.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.320]  I'm just going to stay right here.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.800]  Okay, you beat it.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.480]  I don't know what was different.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.720]  I mean, it was the exact same.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.160]  I would say that's probably a good
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.920]  place to wrap this one up.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.600]  Because we still have to watch bonus material, Andrew.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:27.780]  That's true.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.960]  I didn't expect
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.200]  these to be so long.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.320]  I thought a level per video would have been great.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.180]  They're so long.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.440]  This video...
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.740]  Guys, if you're looking to just have something noisy...
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.280]  Wait, it put you back in this fucking hub world?
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.740]  It put me back in the hub.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.360]  So you're right, it is perfect.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.040]  What a great way to wrap this one up.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.200]  We've got to watch the bonus video.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.180]  If you just have this on
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.000]  while you're making a burrito for lunch
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.260]  and you're just like, this is great, this is just noise.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.780]  Wow, it's like an hour and a half?
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.520]  You're stoked, not for quality, but for quantity.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.480]  Keep going.
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.100]  No, but that's bonus pack one.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:08.880]  We've already seen it.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.480]  Awesome.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.280]  Look at this.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.840]  High concept art.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.940]  This is the courtyard alley right here.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.760]  We've seen it. We know what it looks like.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.540]  Yeah.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.420]  You think this is for the game or the movie?
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.080]  I think some of it's for the game
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.720]  and I think when it says Pixar
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.020]  it's definitely for the movie.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.080]  That makes sense.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.680]  I think that there's some of this stuff where it's like
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:34.560]  this...
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.240]  That's awesome looking.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.360]  This is really cool.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.600]  I would hang that up if there were rats in a boat
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.600]  somewhere in that.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.060]  If a rat was working that newsstand
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:46.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.700]  He has a little newsie cap on.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.120]  You're like, oh man, that's so great.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.780]  Okay, well we've done
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:55.100]  the bonus pack for this. Now it's my bonus.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:55.540]  Great.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.600]  Little episode topper. Let's go back to
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.660]  the dashboard.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.520]  Xbox home.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.240]  I've been going through
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.480]  Xbox history a little bit.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.860]  First of all, look at my avatar.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.040]  I love your avatar.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.100]  We're going into movies and TV.
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:13.940]  Microsoft movies and TV.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.080]  You know,
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.580]  everything is in here.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.860]  It's their weird app,
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.460]  but the company went away.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.240]  As you may know, that's why we're independent.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.880]  That's why we're doing this
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.460]  and you might be watching this on Patreon.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.160]  Please don't forget to subscribe.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.020]  People might be missing the past
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.680]  a little bit, so I was looking through
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.040]  my history.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.800]  Let's just
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.940]  search out...
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.110]  I'm watching an episode of 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.120]  Dude, what?
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.080]  Andrew, this is insane.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.360]  I haven't seen this in a very long time.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.720]  I went through my download history.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.040]  I downloaded all these things.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.960]  Let's watch some... I'm sure Geoff is in this.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.140]  Oh, he has to be, right?
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.040]  We must.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.360]  Gavin must be going crazy for this.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.580]  I don't even remember what game this is for.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.240]  Do you know what game this is?
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.420]  I think
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:11.680]  it may have been a 360.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.340]  This is so cinematic.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.700]  It doesn't need to be.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.020]  I mean, this is... listen.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.720]  They were auteurs
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:22.600]  over there.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.280]  That is a
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.080]  very artistic shot. That was it?
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.340]  No, it's the
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.780]  intro. Oh, thank God.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.140]  I thought that was the whole thing. You clearly have never seen
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.300]  1-800-MAGIC. Dude, I thought that was
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.300]  the whole thing and I'm like, I don't know why they made that.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.180]  Listen, comedy
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.040]  is coming, Eric.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.740]  This is great.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.300]  Okay, we gotta establish
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.200]  this. This is good.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:57.860]  I don't recognize these voices.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.580]  Is that Joel, maybe?
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:09.620]  Yeah, it's definitely Joel.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.480]  Okay.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.600]  Listen, Joel now knows a lot more about
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.680]  guns than he did back then.
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.380]  This is for 1-800-MAGIC
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.740]  for the game Shadowrun.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.020]  Okay, yeah.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:30.520]  Yeah.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.500]  That's definitely Joel, right?
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.200]  Okay. Yeah.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.420]  It says on
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.280]  the fandom Wikipedia that...
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:42.620]  That's Geoff!
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.060]  Listen, that's a modified voice, Geoff.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.040]  Not this guy, the other guy.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.320]  I think that's Geoff.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.660]  That's definitely Geoff.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.700]  I think that's Matt.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:12.520]  Gus does
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.580]  a voice for someone named Beakman.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:15.640]  Okay.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.260]  Bernie is a guy named Johnson.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.440]  This is all written by Joel.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.780]  There's one
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.420]  Andrew.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.100]  Andrew.
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.160]  There is one comment
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.260]  from 2018 about
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.480]  1-800-MAGIC on the fandom
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.620]  Wikipedia. The original run.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.460]  June 7th, 2007
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.060]  to July 4th, 2007.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.100]  One comment from
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.320]  Dil Kevlar from 2018.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.420]  As much as I enjoy
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.320]  Joel Heyman's writing and humor,
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.320]  I cannot enjoy this series enough
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.200]  to write about it.
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.900]  But you did!
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.580]  You already have!
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840]  You fool!
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:01.860]  You fool!
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.970]  That's Bernie, isn't it?
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.020]  I think it's the guy who's saying,
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.840]  Right now! That sounded like Bernie.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.880]  Oh my god.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.180]  I cannot.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:22.560]  2007.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.720]  I wonder how they made
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.420]  the mouse move.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.220]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.740]  You know, we might have to ask
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.700]  Geoff about this.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.600]  I'm going to put it in my notes.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.760]  If you want to watch this
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]  not on Xbox,
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.500]  I mean, I don't know
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.340]  if you can still access the website,
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.740]  but it's on Roosters.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.860]  It's on Roosters.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:55.220]  It's also on YouTube,
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.120]  but I wouldn't trust those rips. I'm just saying.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.300]  I got this straight from Microsoft.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.560]  Oh yeah, these aren't going anywhere, dude.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.840]  You got these locked in, bro.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.660]  This is really long.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.080]  It's, uh, yeah.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.640]  It's like five minutes, so we're almost there.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.880]  I've left a comment
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.720]  on the Rooster Teeth site
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.300]  that just says,
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.520]  Guys, I'm locked in.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:28.940]  The last comment was
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.680]  The last comment was
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.740]  two years ago. The previous comment was
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.780]  four years ago. This is great.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.080]  So this is...
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.700]  Oh boy, this is awesome.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.860]  Do you think this is IP I should ask for?
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:42.800]  Yeah,
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.000]  you need to add it to the list or else we're in
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.820]  trouble. Guys, I gotta get 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:50.280]  I'm magical.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:52.540]  I'm
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.520]  the one.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.020]  Oh my god.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.420]  Let's see if there's credits.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.300]  1-800-MAGIC.com
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.900]  Alright, let's give that a look.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:06.100]  Yeah, where does 1-800-MAGIC.com
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:06.580]  take you?
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.000]  1-800-MAGIC.com
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.520]  takes you to...
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.300]  Oh, it's thinking.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:14.900]  Not good.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:16.860]  Not good.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.220]  Do we need to buy 1-800-MAGIC.com as well?
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.080]  We might have to buy 1-800-MAGIC.com.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:23.320]  Oh yeah,
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.260]  server not found.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.740]  Okay, well,
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.800]  add it to the list.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.360]  Eric, this has been another fantastic episode.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.880]  We got more 1-800-MAGIC to watch
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:33.540]  at some point.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.620]  Interview with Shia LaBeouf.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:38.420]  Way of Ted Dog.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.220]  That's how they spelled it, not me.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.380]  Jesus Christ.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.040]  I can't wait to do this again.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.760]  I'm very excited for the next one.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:47.500]  We'll continue the guide.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.180]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.680]  However you have.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.860]  Go to the description.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.840]  There's a link in the description
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.840]  to where you can sign up for the Patreon
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:59.080]  for more content like this.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.180]  If you say...
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.240]  Oh my God.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.080]  You just have so much shit.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.380]  This is crazy.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.260]  I've been downloading...
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.880]  I went through my whole 360 history
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.020]  and I'm just pulling stuff.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.360]  If you want to see more of this,
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.400]  you can subscribe or listen to the podcast.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.200]  That's probably a number one for us right now.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.300]  Thank you so much.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.340]  We'll see you in the next Achievement Guide for Ratatouille.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:22.920]  Bye!
