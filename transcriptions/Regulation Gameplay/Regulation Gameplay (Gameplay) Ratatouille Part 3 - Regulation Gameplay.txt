[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  Hello and welcome to another Rat Guide Part 3, I think?
[00:05.040 --> 00:08.820]  Yeah, Part 3. This is where we're getting all the achievements, so that way...
[00:08.820 --> 00:11.720]  Okay, the Active Gamer has already signed in with the Gamer Profile.
[00:11.740 --> 00:12.840]  The Active Gamer always makes me laugh.
[00:12.860 --> 00:13.620]  Cool, alright, great.
[00:14.100 --> 00:17.840]  You are... and if you're watching this, you are also the Active Gamer
[00:17.840 --> 00:22.880]  who wants to know how to get 100% of the achievements in Ratatouille
[00:22.880 --> 00:26.240]  on the Xbox 360 from 2007.
[00:26.240 --> 00:32.060]  Um, we have merely scratched... Jesus Christ, that's a lot of fucking achievements, dude.
[00:32.720 --> 00:33.680]  Yeah, I've played a lot of games.
[00:33.980 --> 00:35.760]  I wanted to pop into achievements really quick.
[00:35.880 --> 00:37.660]  One of my favorite things of the achievement...
[00:37.660 --> 00:39.520]  You get art, as you may know.
[00:39.680 --> 00:41.100]  You get some of that fancy achievement art.
[00:41.240 --> 00:41.340]  Yeah.
[00:42.020 --> 00:45.020]  Ratatouille went all out and just reuses the same things.
[00:45.420 --> 00:46.460]  Oh, that's great.
[00:46.940 --> 00:48.560]  That is fantastic.
[00:50.200 --> 00:51.400]  Oh, this is great.
[00:51.520 --> 00:52.720]  This stupid fucking rat.
[00:52.860 --> 00:53.480]  Oh, this is great.
[00:53.540 --> 00:54.200]  Oh, it's so dumb.
[00:54.720 --> 00:56.220]  Okay, let's load in.
[00:57.360 --> 00:58.240]  Resume story.
[00:58.460 --> 01:01.160]  I have been looking forward to this.
[01:01.220 --> 01:02.080]  We took a couple days out.
[01:02.160 --> 01:02.900]  We had like the weekend.
[01:03.220 --> 01:05.280]  Uh, I've been looking forward to this.
[01:05.360 --> 01:05.960]  Very excited.
[01:06.080 --> 01:11.820]  And then I also sent you a video that I got on TikTok of someone playing Ratatouille on TikTok.
[01:11.820 --> 01:15.140]  And I just went totally just on my feet.
[01:15.140 --> 01:15.740]  That is insane.
[01:15.960 --> 01:16.920]  Fucking crazy.
[01:17.240 --> 01:18.040]  Totally just on my feet.
[01:18.040 --> 01:20.640]  China is watching your rat activity.
[01:20.800 --> 01:21.120]  Absolutely.
[01:21.340 --> 01:22.060]  But that's the thing.
[01:22.120 --> 01:22.620]  They can.
[01:22.720 --> 01:23.280]  I don't mind.
[01:23.460 --> 01:25.420]  I really, I genuinely don't mind.
[01:25.420 --> 01:26.460]  If that's how...
[01:26.860 --> 01:27.500]  Here's the thing.
[01:27.600 --> 01:29.880]  I have all my data my whole life.
[01:30.020 --> 01:31.640]  And this is how far it's gotten me?
[01:31.840 --> 01:33.040]  Good fucking luck, China.
[01:33.320 --> 01:34.980]  You're not getting shit with this stuff, baby.
[01:37.220 --> 01:37.620]  What?
[01:38.040 --> 01:39.040]  No, that's not.
[01:39.100 --> 01:39.820]  I'm trying to remember.
[01:39.940 --> 01:40.360]  Trying to get back to work.
[01:40.360 --> 01:42.220]  So we've taken a long enough gap.
[01:42.500 --> 01:44.420]  Yeah, where I don't remember anything.
[01:46.440 --> 01:49.440]  We have to find our way back to the city?
[01:50.700 --> 01:51.400]  Oh, we do.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.500]  But I could have swore it was just over here.
[01:53.560 --> 01:54.840]  I thought it was this way also.
[01:54.840 --> 01:56.020]  And certainly it's not.
[01:57.140 --> 01:58.320]  Maybe it's up here.
[01:58.380 --> 01:59.560]  I doubt it's up here.
[02:01.560 --> 02:03.200]  No, there's nothing there.
[02:03.420 --> 02:03.820]  It's got to be.
[02:03.920 --> 02:05.080]  It just has to be a different way.
[02:06.480 --> 02:07.020]  Shut up.
[02:07.120 --> 02:07.420]  Shut up.
[02:07.420 --> 02:08.400]  I don't want to.
[02:09.780 --> 02:10.840]  Who do you think you are?
[02:10.920 --> 02:11.580]  You're a fucking rat.
[02:11.660 --> 02:12.220]  Oh, come on.
[02:12.260 --> 02:13.660]  Don't get hurt in the mouse cave.
[02:14.800 --> 02:16.080]  I'm just trying to figure.
[02:16.340 --> 02:18.560]  Listen, if you're going to die, you want to die in the mouse cave.
[02:19.840 --> 02:20.880]  Can I just bully this kid?
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.660]  Wow, you're just beating the shit out of that rat.
[02:22.860 --> 02:23.700]  That small ass rat.
[02:23.700 --> 02:25.280]  So it must just not be this way.
[02:25.380 --> 02:26.380]  It must just be a different way.
[02:27.640 --> 02:28.260]  I guess.
[02:28.360 --> 02:30.060]  Yeah, these, I mean, they all kind of look the same.
[02:30.180 --> 02:30.700]  Yeah, they look...
[02:30.700 --> 02:31.720]  Okay, it's definitely this way.
[02:31.840 --> 02:32.560]  It has to be.
[02:32.620 --> 02:33.340]  Is it this way?
[02:33.420 --> 02:34.440]  It's got to be, right?
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.580]  I mean, there's only three...
[02:35.580 --> 02:36.380]  No, it's blocked.
[02:36.880 --> 02:37.860]  I can't go that way.
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.540]  Okay, so it's got to be this way.
[02:39.560 --> 02:40.000]  This way?
[02:40.180 --> 02:40.740]  Has to be.
[02:41.860 --> 02:42.480]  Has to be.
[02:42.500 --> 02:42.800]  Has to.
[02:42.800 --> 02:43.360]  There's no other ways.
[02:47.360 --> 02:47.900]  Maybe we...
[02:47.900 --> 02:50.860]  Maybe we are supposed to do the bucket thing that it was saying.
[02:52.600 --> 02:52.880]  Maybe.
[02:53.600 --> 02:54.340]  It doesn't seem right.
[02:54.340 --> 02:54.780]  I mean, let's look for...
[02:54.780 --> 02:55.800]  So the...
[02:56.680 --> 02:58.000]  Okay, so white light.
[02:58.220 --> 03:02.180]  I thought maybe because that's red and that's green, that that indicated I have to go that way.
[03:02.200 --> 03:02.940]  But they're just different colors.
[03:02.940 --> 03:03.860]  No, no, it's just different colors.
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.020]  What I really like about this is we said we're going to be the guide to get you 100%.
[03:08.020 --> 03:09.300]  We can't get out of the mouse cave.
[03:11.420 --> 03:13.420]  Well, this is the guide to get out of the mouse cave.
[03:13.420 --> 03:14.080]  Yes, yeah, yeah.
[03:14.080 --> 03:14.680]  This is how you do it.
[03:14.700 --> 03:16.480]  This is how you and your friends get out of the mouse cave.
[03:17.100 --> 03:17.840]  Can you grab that coin?
[03:17.980 --> 03:18.160]  What is...
[03:18.160 --> 03:18.820]  Do I go this way?
[03:18.980 --> 03:19.760]  Yeah, I feel like...
[03:19.760 --> 03:20.840]  Oh, you have to collect a hundred?
[03:20.840 --> 03:22.260]  We definitely...
[03:22.260 --> 03:23.820]  Yeah, it's like the hub collection.
[03:24.780 --> 03:27.840]  I feel like we definitely didn't go that way because of that coin.
[03:28.040 --> 03:28.880]  Yeah, we would have got...
[03:28.880 --> 03:29.440]  Oh, yeah, 100%, 100%.
[03:30.540 --> 03:32.540]  So let's go back this way.
[03:32.880 --> 03:33.560]  Take that.
[03:33.920 --> 03:34.540]  Got your health back.
[03:35.500 --> 03:36.420]  It's got to be...
[03:36.420 --> 03:37.240]  It has to be that thing.
[03:38.900 --> 03:40.520]  Like, how do I...
[03:41.420 --> 03:44.240]  You must unlock like rat wings later.
[03:44.460 --> 03:45.000]  You know what I mean?
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.820]  Like, you must become like a Snoopy style fighter, combat fighter.
[03:50.820 --> 03:53.440]  Uh, Ratatouille does that.
[03:53.540 --> 03:54.480]  It has to be this thing.
[03:55.020 --> 03:56.140]  It has to be.
[03:56.200 --> 03:56.380]  Yeah.
[03:56.540 --> 03:56.940]  All right.
[03:56.980 --> 03:58.220]  Help the gang, distract...
[03:58.220 --> 03:59.140]  Yeah, we're just gonna try.
[03:59.200 --> 03:59.720]  We're gonna see.
[03:59.980 --> 04:00.760]  We're just gonna see what happens.
[04:00.760 --> 04:01.020]  The nose knows, baby.
[04:01.740 --> 04:02.660]  Guys, that's a good tip.
[04:02.840 --> 04:03.880]  Don't forget this tip.
[04:03.980 --> 04:04.740]  The nose knows.
[04:05.540 --> 04:07.080]  Honestly, we probably shouldn't use that.
[04:08.400 --> 04:08.960]  Have you...
[04:08.960 --> 04:09.800]  Oh, yeah.
[04:09.920 --> 04:11.480]  Well, no, it might guide us to the next mission.
[04:12.000 --> 04:12.220]  Yeah.
[04:12.260 --> 04:12.740]  We don't know.
[04:13.000 --> 04:13.560]  I had no idea.
[04:13.600 --> 04:14.240]  Because we got to clean up.
[04:14.280 --> 04:16.420]  We did most of the work in the last one.
[04:17.000 --> 04:17.520]  Oh, wow.
[04:17.640 --> 04:19.000]  Okay, so that was the right thing.
[04:19.920 --> 04:20.180]  Okay.
[04:20.180 --> 04:22.000]  Oh, wait, you have 10 minutes to do something?
[04:22.020 --> 04:22.800]  No, wait, why do we have a timer?
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  Oh, you just skipped all the fucking instructions.
[04:26.620 --> 04:27.240]  Yeah, it's fine.
[04:27.340 --> 04:27.820]  Don't need them.
[04:28.120 --> 04:28.400]  Nope.
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.620]  What does that mean?
[04:29.680 --> 04:30.480]  You don't need them?
[04:30.580 --> 04:30.800]  Wait, wait.
[04:31.520 --> 04:32.700]  We just got another coin.
[04:32.760 --> 04:33.180]  Okay, we got a coin.
[04:33.200 --> 04:33.680]  That's great.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.780]  What is that coin up there?
[04:35.320 --> 04:36.140]  I don't know.
[04:37.620 --> 04:37.940]  Okay.
[04:38.140 --> 04:38.860]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:39.020 --> 04:40.220]  What's that with your tail or something?
[04:40.300 --> 04:40.960]  Oh, fuck.
[04:41.040 --> 04:41.660]  It was blue.
[04:41.920 --> 04:43.780]  It definitely seemed like you had to do something there.
[04:45.080 --> 04:45.480]  Look at it.
[04:45.600 --> 04:45.800]  Blue.
[04:45.920 --> 04:46.460]  Blue as hell.
[04:48.240 --> 04:48.780]  Wait, wait.
[04:48.920 --> 04:49.560]  Hit right button.
[04:49.560 --> 04:50.480]  Hit right bumper.
[04:50.760 --> 04:51.980]  B, B, B.
[04:52.480 --> 04:53.220]  I gotta carry it.
[04:53.500 --> 04:53.520]  Oh.
[04:53.900 --> 04:54.560]  Right bumper.
[04:55.740 --> 04:59.420]  No, right bumper was... there was like a hint.
[04:59.580 --> 05:00.280]  Oh, I gotta break it.
[05:01.480 --> 05:01.840]  Fuck.
[05:01.840 --> 05:02.100]  There you go.
[05:02.240 --> 05:02.720]  Oh, goddammit.
[05:02.760 --> 05:06.460]  Okay, I'm just gonna walk the path first and just see and then like clear.
[05:06.960 --> 05:07.380]  It has to...
[05:07.380 --> 05:08.000]  Okay, so it's right there.
[05:08.380 --> 05:09.020]  It has to be right there.
[05:09.120 --> 05:09.420]  Okay, cool.
[05:09.520 --> 05:10.200]  And then that's the umbrella.
[05:10.300 --> 05:10.800]  Don't do that yet!
[05:12.060 --> 05:12.680]  Why not?
[05:12.760 --> 05:15.240]  Because you have to put the fucking grinder up here, you dummy.
[05:16.160 --> 05:18.100]  What is over here, though?
[05:18.100 --> 05:20.520]  But that's where... we're gonna end up going over there.
[05:20.580 --> 05:22.960]  Just put the turntable thing over here.
[05:23.060 --> 05:23.080]  Okay, okay, okay.
[05:23.140 --> 05:23.820]  Fuck me!
[05:23.880 --> 05:24.480]  Come on.
[05:24.520 --> 05:25.680]  Jesus Christ.
[05:25.780 --> 05:26.140]  Pay attention.
[05:26.220 --> 05:26.920]  Okay, got the dumb grinder.
[05:26.920 --> 05:27.820]  Get your head in the game, dude.
[05:27.880 --> 05:28.360]  I'm paying.
[05:28.560 --> 05:29.520]  I know, I know!
[05:29.580 --> 05:31.660]  I know we took a break, but get your head in the game.
[05:32.480 --> 05:33.580]  I would argue my head is too in the game.
[05:33.580 --> 05:34.480]  What are you doing?!
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.300]  Fuck me!
[05:35.780 --> 05:36.960]  Why are they reusable?
[05:37.340 --> 05:39.800]  I just assumed they would turn off after a while.
[05:40.100 --> 05:40.260]  Okay.
[05:40.260 --> 05:41.300]  That's not how rat traps work.
[05:41.380 --> 05:42.480]  Okay, so got this thing.
[05:43.300 --> 05:44.700]  Oh, sick beats, dude.
[05:44.740 --> 05:45.580]  That is my favorite song.
[05:47.140 --> 05:48.720]  That is the song I walk down the aisle to.
[05:49.120 --> 05:50.380]  Uh, okay, so...
[05:52.460 --> 05:52.740]  Ah!
[05:52.800 --> 05:53.380]  Oh, hell yeah.
[05:53.780 --> 05:54.060]  Remix!
[05:54.100 --> 05:55.480]  Okay, good game.
[05:55.860 --> 05:56.420]  Good game.
[05:57.760 --> 05:59.160]  I didn't think that would work.
[05:59.400 --> 06:00.060]  Absolutely not.
[06:00.180 --> 06:02.560]  Okay, so do you think you jump over there and hit B?
[06:02.900 --> 06:04.280]  No, no, you gotta hit the button to land on it.
[06:04.300 --> 06:04.440]  I forgot.
[06:04.560 --> 06:04.880]  I forgot.
[06:04.980 --> 06:05.240]  I forgot.
[06:05.340 --> 06:05.560]  I forgot.
[06:05.680 --> 06:06.380]  It's okay, we recovered.
[06:06.420 --> 06:06.840]  We recovered.
[06:06.840 --> 06:07.600]  What happened to get your head in the game?
[06:07.900 --> 06:09.040]  You just said you had your head in the game.
[06:09.160 --> 06:09.920]  I'm too in the game!
[06:11.420 --> 06:12.540]  Can I... what if I sprint?
[06:12.580 --> 06:13.240]  Yeah, go the other way.
[06:13.280 --> 06:15.020]  You are so... this is worse than fuck.
[06:15.020 --> 06:16.500]  Oh my god.
[06:16.500 --> 06:20.080]  Hang on.
[06:20.320 --> 06:20.820]  Hang on.
[06:21.060 --> 06:21.380]  Hang on.
[06:21.380 --> 06:22.200]  Oh no!
[06:22.700 --> 06:24.940]  Oh no, Wratty... Ratatouille!
[06:25.500 --> 06:25.980]  Remy!
[06:26.840 --> 06:28.260]  Oh, look at his dumb mouth.
[06:32.040 --> 06:33.500]  Oh my god!
[06:33.760 --> 06:34.480]  He died.
[06:36.540 --> 06:38.780]  Alright, let's give it one more try.
[06:38.800 --> 06:39.340]  Okay, start over.
[06:39.760 --> 06:39.860]  Yeah.
[06:40.040 --> 06:40.460]  Oh my god.
[06:40.680 --> 06:40.780]  Uh, reboot.
[06:41.280 --> 06:42.020]  Oh man.
[06:42.140 --> 06:44.800]  Okay, at least we kind of know what we're doing a little bit.
[06:44.800 --> 06:46.580]  Don't hit that, that's health, you don't need that yet.
[06:47.200 --> 06:48.100]  Nope, don't need it.
[06:48.400 --> 06:50.540]  Look at that, what a shortcut.
[06:50.800 --> 06:51.540]  Now, but here's the thing.
[06:52.020 --> 06:54.740]  You're going to tail whip this thing, you're going to have to go back down and get it.
[06:55.800 --> 06:57.560]  No, it's fine, I'm going to put it over here this time.
[06:57.640 --> 06:58.340]  Oh, nice!
[06:58.740 --> 07:00.820]  I'm getting into my rat mode.
[07:01.020 --> 07:03.840]  Wow, this is getting your head in the game right here.
[07:06.220 --> 07:09.060]  Like, being called an act of anything, I feel like is bad.
[07:09.820 --> 07:12.720]  I associate active, the next word is terrible.
[07:13.440 --> 07:16.760]  We have an active gamer, ladies and gentlemen, an active gamer.
[07:18.460 --> 07:22.020]  Okay, so you think you jump on that and you hit like B or something?
[07:22.220 --> 07:24.140]  Yeah, let's try that, let's try that.
[07:24.280 --> 07:25.040]  Yeah, there you go.
[07:25.720 --> 07:27.660]  And then hop up there, we'll see what's over here.
[07:28.660 --> 07:30.220]  Why does it keep doing this?
[07:30.500 --> 07:31.700]  I don't know.
[07:31.940 --> 07:33.080]  On the light, oh god.
[07:33.560 --> 07:34.920]  Is there anything in it?
[07:36.160 --> 07:39.760]  Oh my god, I'm trying to get the camera out of here.
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.300]  Ah!
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.780]  Okay, so you gotta go back to where the umbrella was, I think, and then umbrella yourself down.
[07:47.800 --> 07:48.240]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[07:49.080 --> 07:50.780]  But then where do you land?
[07:53.400 --> 07:55.100]  It's gotta be that point, yeah, it's gotta be that.
[07:58.100 --> 07:59.760]  Whatever, I'm just gonna land here.
[08:00.200 --> 08:01.280]  Okay, safe, oh god!
[08:01.540 --> 08:03.640]  Nope, I thought it would take me up.
[08:04.400 --> 08:05.920]  That's okay, that's okay, we're good.
[08:06.360 --> 08:07.280]  Alright, up here.
[08:07.280 --> 08:09.020]  What the fuck is this?
[08:09.120 --> 08:09.820]  There you go.
[08:10.160 --> 08:12.780]  You need to flood the gutter, tie a rope to the faucet so it can be turned on.
[08:12.940 --> 08:14.020]  Okay, great.
[08:16.040 --> 08:16.560]  That's it.
[08:17.060 --> 08:17.740]  Oh, yeah, fling!
[08:18.720 --> 08:19.760]  And then land, hit the button!
[08:19.900 --> 08:22.180]  Okay, so that's how you turn it on.
[08:22.760 --> 08:23.560]  So you need a rope.
[08:25.320 --> 08:26.580]  Where do you get a rope?
[08:31.940 --> 08:34.960]  I know, I'm here, I'm already at the faucet, dude.
[08:36.720 --> 08:37.560]  Okay, rope.
[08:37.900 --> 08:39.760]  Let's go to the coin symbol on the minimap.
[08:39.940 --> 08:41.300]  Or maybe my nose.
[08:41.860 --> 08:42.900]  Nope, my nose is it.
[08:43.280 --> 08:44.600]  The nose knows, sometimes.
[08:45.620 --> 08:47.020]  Yeah, hop up here and go right.
[08:48.420 --> 08:50.600]  I just wanna go straight, I just wanna see what this one is.
[08:50.720 --> 08:50.860]  Okay.
[08:51.720 --> 08:53.240]  It's kinda far away from everything.
[08:55.040 --> 08:55.940]  I think it's up.
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.120]  You think it's up above?
[08:58.140 --> 08:58.700]  Yeah, I think so.
[08:59.420 --> 09:00.540]  Okay, let's go up.
[09:02.120 --> 09:03.800]  I'm trying to remember how to do that.
[09:03.900 --> 09:05.740]  We unlock the shortcut to do that, right?
[09:06.160 --> 09:06.780]  Yeah, what?
[09:08.360 --> 09:09.680]  Look around, look around.
[09:09.840 --> 09:11.560]  Can you go back over the tightrope?
[09:11.700 --> 09:13.040]  No, that's where you start it, isn't it?
[09:13.960 --> 09:16.080]  Yeah, I'm gonna go all the way to the...
[09:16.080 --> 09:17.300]  Yeah, I just don't think it's over here.
[09:17.300 --> 09:18.740]  I think we unlock something over here.
[09:18.860 --> 09:21.180]  No, no, this is gonna be the way out, this isn't the thing.
[09:22.200 --> 09:24.040]  No, but it's just the way to get up.
[09:24.300 --> 09:25.380]  Remember we unlocked...
[09:25.380 --> 09:27.720]  I just don't think this is the way to go at all.
[09:27.720 --> 09:30.760]  I think that you are overthinking the Rat Game from 2007.
[09:32.120 --> 09:34.480]  I mean, I think you're trying to like...
[09:34.480 --> 09:36.040]  Oh, yeah, clearly this is the shortcut.
[09:36.300 --> 09:40.660]  And it's like, you're on a time limit and you're going away from everything.
[09:40.880 --> 09:43.620]  Like, there's no fucking shot that this is the right way to go.
[09:44.380 --> 09:45.800]  No, but it is a way.
[09:46.200 --> 09:48.060]  This is the only way I remember.
[09:49.540 --> 09:51.200]  Remember for what, though?
[09:52.500 --> 09:55.700]  Getting up top to that upper area that you thought the thing was at.
[09:55.700 --> 09:57.340]  Uh, no, don't put this on me.
[09:57.400 --> 09:59.160]  Don't hang this albatross on my neck.
[09:59.180 --> 10:00.740]  I didn't say to go this way.
[10:01.660 --> 10:02.820]  Absolutely not, no.
[10:03.360 --> 10:05.360]  You could have let back up.
[10:05.640 --> 10:07.100]  You could have sprung up.
[10:07.460 --> 10:09.620]  You could have jumped on the ropes, you would have been fine.
[10:10.260 --> 10:12.320]  You chose to go this way for some reason.
[10:13.360 --> 10:15.480]  Because it's the only way I remember to get up that way.
[10:16.160 --> 10:17.460]  It's not the way.
[10:17.660 --> 10:21.660]  It's the longest detour ever, but it is the way to the thing.
[10:21.760 --> 10:22.820]  Absolutely not.
[10:22.820 --> 10:24.400]  No fucking shot.
[10:24.580 --> 10:27.580]  We're making a guide. We're establishing the correct protocols.
[10:28.020 --> 10:29.440]  Maybe this isn't the correct protocol.
[10:29.640 --> 10:33.120]  And people will now know because of what we're doing right here.
[10:33.220 --> 10:33.800]  That's great.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.340]  I don't, uh...
[10:37.880 --> 10:40.340]  This isn't what I was thinking would be up here.
[10:40.460 --> 10:41.540]  A little unfamiliar, huh, Andrew?
[10:42.000 --> 10:42.440]  Interesting.
[10:42.740 --> 10:45.540]  Yeah, I don't think we've been here.
[10:47.280 --> 10:48.040]  Well, there you go.
[10:48.420 --> 10:49.420]  Yeah, cross.
[10:49.420 --> 10:51.100]  No, come on, man. This is your shortcut.
[10:51.560 --> 10:53.400]  This is the way you know to go.
[10:55.500 --> 10:56.060]  Rat's dead.
[10:56.820 --> 10:58.040]  No fucking chance.
[10:59.580 --> 11:02.220]  I think you just need to turn on the faucet one time.
[11:02.680 --> 11:03.720]  Let's do the same thing.
[11:03.800 --> 11:04.440]  Let's hit the crank.
[11:04.860 --> 11:05.640]  Do all that shit.
[11:06.260 --> 11:09.980]  And then I think you need to go and turn on the faucet.
[11:11.060 --> 11:12.560]  Do you think it's just hitting it?
[11:12.740 --> 11:13.620]  Did I try hitting it?
[11:13.660 --> 11:15.100]  No, you didn't do anything to it.
[11:16.020 --> 11:16.500]  Okay.
[11:16.640 --> 11:18.040]  I'll try swiping at it.
[11:18.120 --> 11:20.760]  Yeah, I think it's going to be like using a rat tail or something.
[11:21.060 --> 11:21.520]  Go there.
[11:22.200 --> 11:23.900]  You're blazing through this part now.
[11:24.900 --> 11:27.480]  I've done this 15 times.
[11:27.840 --> 11:29.140]  Boring, next thing.
[11:30.500 --> 11:31.840]  You're going to spin the record.
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.460]  It can be remixed once.
[11:34.980 --> 11:36.020]  We do a rat remix.
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.340]  No!
[11:38.440 --> 11:40.300]  That was so fucking lucky.
[11:40.660 --> 11:42.020]  Well, that's actually a speedrun tip.
[11:43.160 --> 11:43.780]  Uh-huh.
[11:44.180 --> 11:44.540]  Yeah.
[11:46.100 --> 11:47.520]  And then you go there.
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.900]  And then you go to the faucet.
[11:51.720 --> 11:52.740]  Hit the button on the...
[11:52.740 --> 11:54.000]  No, nothing, huh?
[11:55.180 --> 11:58.000]  Okay, so we have to be able to find a rope.
[11:58.160 --> 11:59.140]  Look around a little bit.
[11:59.240 --> 12:00.900]  There's got to be something over here.
[12:01.300 --> 12:02.820]  I can't because of the wall.
[12:03.320 --> 12:04.300]  Let me get behind.
[12:05.620 --> 12:06.660]  Yeah, we know Patton.
[12:06.700 --> 12:07.480]  I think we have to go to the right.
[12:07.480 --> 12:09.360]  I like that you're calling him Patton.
[12:09.420 --> 12:10.800]  It's Patton Hospital.
[12:11.420 --> 12:12.300]  It is.
[12:12.740 --> 12:13.940]  It's just his voice.
[12:14.440 --> 12:16.080]  He's not stretching for this performance.
[12:17.560 --> 12:18.740]  There's no shot it's this way.
[12:18.820 --> 12:20.420]  It's got to be back over by this faucet.
[12:21.820 --> 12:23.840]  Hit the red and go to the right.
[12:24.880 --> 12:25.600]  Yeah, let's go up.
[12:27.320 --> 12:27.880]  Oh, there.
[12:29.880 --> 12:30.580]  Right there.
[12:31.200 --> 12:31.920]  That was easy.
[12:32.900 --> 12:33.900]  Oh no, that's the old one.
[12:33.900 --> 12:35.640]  Yeah, that's the coin.
[12:36.280 --> 12:36.680]  Shit.
[12:37.280 --> 12:38.320]  I thought that was the second coin.
[12:39.720 --> 12:42.200]  But you can jump and go on that wall.
[12:43.120 --> 12:44.200]  Swing the camera around.
[12:44.380 --> 12:45.180]  Yeah, you can jump on that wall.
[12:45.220 --> 12:46.200]  I can climb that.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.980]  This might be a way to go.
[12:49.260 --> 12:51.000]  I just don't think so.
[12:52.520 --> 12:53.480]  It's getting us up.
[12:56.180 --> 12:57.280]  Oh, there's a coin up there.
[12:57.760 --> 12:59.000]  This will launch us across, right?
[13:00.440 --> 13:00.720]  Oh.
[13:00.720 --> 13:01.780]  What the fuck?
[13:02.680 --> 13:03.660]  We can just keep going up.
[13:04.040 --> 13:04.840]  Holy shit.
[13:05.940 --> 13:07.220]  Oh, this cannot be right.
[13:07.360 --> 13:09.160]  There's no chance this is the right way to go.
[13:11.520 --> 13:12.980]  Oh, there's a coin, right?
[13:13.240 --> 13:13.620]  Yeah.
[13:14.200 --> 13:15.300]  But how do you get there?
[13:16.780 --> 13:19.180]  Let's go back down and I'll try the bounce thing.
[13:19.540 --> 13:21.000]  What a way to climb down!
[13:21.440 --> 13:22.640]  It's the exact...
[13:22.640 --> 13:23.640]  It's a different animation.
[13:23.920 --> 13:24.600]  It's just insane.
[13:25.040 --> 13:27.140]  I just don't think this is the right way.
[13:28.940 --> 13:29.300]  Wow!
[13:29.800 --> 13:30.140]  Okay.
[13:33.240 --> 13:34.620]  Okay, use the rat ball. Hit RB.
[13:36.040 --> 13:37.260]  I am. It's just finicky.
[13:37.720 --> 13:39.020]  No, right bump. There you go.
[13:39.280 --> 13:40.900]  The coin's stuck in the gutter. Get the ball.
[13:41.800 --> 13:42.160]  Okay.
[13:42.840 --> 13:43.120]  Okay.
[13:48.120 --> 13:48.480]  How...
[13:48.480 --> 13:51.000]  I've already been there. I can't do anything there.
[13:51.940 --> 13:54.940]  How do we get the ball to the...
[13:54.940 --> 13:56.280]  Where's Emil?
[13:56.480 --> 13:57.360]  I don't even know where he is.
[13:57.460 --> 13:59.100]  Can you hit your rat nose?
[13:59.820 --> 14:00.520]  I tried.
[14:00.720 --> 14:03.100]  It doesn't do nothing.
[14:05.080 --> 14:06.620]  It ain't smelling shit.
[14:07.200 --> 14:09.580]  This ball is something with the gutter.
[14:13.340 --> 14:14.460]  Let's just explore.
[14:14.700 --> 14:15.500]  I guess.
[14:17.180 --> 14:18.640]  So we started over here.
[14:19.940 --> 14:21.140]  No, not that way.
[14:22.020 --> 14:23.300]  Not that way.
[14:23.300 --> 14:23.800]  No, no, no.
[14:24.860 --> 14:27.140]  The coin is stuck in the gutter. I thought we did this.
[14:28.420 --> 14:30.480]  The coin is stuck in the gutter.
[14:30.680 --> 14:32.020]  What gutter?
[14:32.380 --> 14:34.340]  You're not going to be able to go up that way. It's going to block you.
[14:34.500 --> 14:35.680]  So there's this.
[14:35.980 --> 14:38.180]  I don't understand the coin is stuck in the gutter.
[14:38.340 --> 14:38.820]  What gutter?
[14:39.220 --> 14:42.900]  I think it's when we went through all this before.
[14:43.200 --> 14:43.500]  Really?
[14:44.700 --> 14:46.000]  Yeah, I think we did this.
[14:47.060 --> 14:49.480]  Let's just go through the whole process again.
[14:49.540 --> 14:49.820]  Okay.
[14:49.820 --> 14:50.640]  I like to pull.
[14:51.560 --> 14:54.360]  None of these things that you think do damage, do damage.
[14:54.700 --> 14:56.800]  I need to remember.
[14:57.100 --> 14:59.140]  You're invincible and you're a rat on a ball.
[14:59.540 --> 15:01.740]  This is so not the way.
[15:02.200 --> 15:04.120]  This is so fucking crazy.
[15:04.360 --> 15:06.480]  No, this is absolutely incorrect.
[15:06.960 --> 15:08.840]  Okay, well now it decided that it does damage.
[15:09.120 --> 15:10.060]  It hurts. It hurts now.
[15:10.540 --> 15:11.180]  Video games are great.
[15:11.380 --> 15:11.840]  Oh my god.
[15:13.880 --> 15:14.320]  Side.
[15:15.120 --> 15:16.080]  Do your nonsense.
[15:16.080 --> 15:17.420]  Do your nonsense.
[15:17.600 --> 15:18.280]  Got it. You're good.
[15:19.060 --> 15:20.780]  Nope, not good.
[15:21.100 --> 15:23.180]  And that ball just vanished. Sweet.
[15:24.600 --> 15:25.740]  Take this again.
[15:26.300 --> 15:28.780]  It's just like, where are we supposed to go?
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.700]  Because we went...
[15:31.700 --> 15:33.520]  I'm hoping this at least takes us
[15:33.520 --> 15:35.560]  to the gutter that we needed to hit.
[15:35.960 --> 15:37.220]  There's just no way.
[15:38.320 --> 15:39.800]  Am I going back the way I came?
[15:39.920 --> 15:40.540]  Boy, I hope so.
[15:41.200 --> 15:43.660]  I fucking hate this game.
[15:43.660 --> 15:45.460]  This bullshit ass.
[15:46.240 --> 15:46.780]  Okay.
[15:47.540 --> 15:49.960]  Go around and then up and then left.
[15:50.960 --> 15:51.500]  Okay.
[15:52.000 --> 15:52.800]  Here we go.
[15:53.640 --> 15:54.900]  So we went through here.
[15:56.700 --> 15:57.680]  Oh my god.
[15:57.940 --> 15:58.420]  You got it.
[15:59.020 --> 15:59.800]  You're okay.
[16:02.480 --> 16:04.120]  I'm getting nervous about the timer.
[16:04.460 --> 16:04.740]  Me too.
[16:04.920 --> 16:06.440]  It just means we're going to have to do it again.
[16:07.740 --> 16:10.200]  The way you and I play video games
[16:10.200 --> 16:11.160]  is so different.
[16:11.160 --> 16:12.780]  It is really astounding.
[16:13.280 --> 16:16.040]  See? We did this and we put it down this pipe.
[16:16.120 --> 16:17.180]  Yeah, so go ahead and go down the pipe
[16:17.180 --> 16:17.800]  and let's see what happens.
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.080]  Great. And there you go.
[16:21.600 --> 16:23.420]  Fantastic. Okay, well I can follow the pipe
[16:23.420 --> 16:25.180]  at least. So I went this way.
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.280]  I'm so gonna die.
[16:28.740 --> 16:30.240]  Let's land on this.
[16:33.780 --> 16:34.220]  Okay.
[16:35.860 --> 16:37.160]  So the coin should be here.
[16:37.700 --> 16:38.440]  But it's not.
[16:39.000 --> 16:39.440]  Great.
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.460]  Okay, let's...
[16:44.460 --> 16:45.640]  Oh, up there!
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.580]  But we know now
[16:50.580 --> 16:52.040]  that the coins don't do anything.
[16:53.620 --> 16:54.640]  I mean, I don't know
[16:54.640 --> 16:55.320]  what else to do.
[16:56.600 --> 16:58.620]  I mean, we're going to have to
[16:58.620 --> 16:59.520]  do this again.
[16:59.960 --> 17:02.500]  Because the way you and I play video games
[17:02.500 --> 17:03.540]  is so different.
[17:04.560 --> 17:06.420]  We're gonna make it within the... Oh, there he is!
[17:06.720 --> 17:08.980]  There's that dumbass. Look at him.
[17:09.140 --> 17:09.940]  Fucking idiot.
[17:12.700 --> 17:13.200]  Okay.
[17:14.300 --> 17:14.800]  Cool.
[17:16.040 --> 17:18.060]  Is this what needed to happen?
[17:18.720 --> 17:20.120]  I think so. I mean, he's...
[17:20.120 --> 17:21.080]  That's where the water is.
[17:22.800 --> 17:23.860]  That's just a coin.
[17:25.960 --> 17:26.740]  That's just a coin.
[17:26.740 --> 17:28.260]  How many times does that happen to you?
[17:28.480 --> 17:30.160]  That doesn't have anything to do
[17:30.160 --> 17:31.580]  with what we just did.
[17:33.660 --> 17:34.160]  What?
[17:34.220 --> 17:35.760]  Oh, you think we're doing a different objective?
[17:35.940 --> 17:36.360]  Yes!
[17:38.360 --> 17:39.400]  Well, let's... Here.
[17:41.120 --> 17:42.080]  Let's go back down.
[17:42.260 --> 17:43.000]  Can you go in that pipe?
[17:43.360 --> 17:44.740]  Well, you're gonna die.
[17:45.120 --> 17:45.900]  Can you go in that pipe?
[17:48.380 --> 17:49.440]  It's a paint can.
[17:49.700 --> 17:50.460]  Oh, that one down there?
[17:51.400 --> 17:53.060]  Did you just watch the cutscene?
[17:53.240 --> 17:53.520]  Or no?
[17:56.220 --> 17:57.740]  I did, but it's gone.
[17:57.960 --> 17:59.400]  No, it's not! It's right there!
[17:59.460 --> 18:00.200]  Oh my god.
[18:00.900 --> 18:02.800]  No, I said the memory is gone.
[18:02.800 --> 18:05.160]  Oh, the memory is gone. I guess go to the coin.
[18:05.280 --> 18:07.040]  Go over to the coin and see if that's what we...
[18:07.040 --> 18:08.240]  You're gonna... Oh my god.
[18:09.140 --> 18:09.840]  That was a coin.
[18:12.700 --> 18:14.320]  Did you have fun doing that?
[18:14.360 --> 18:15.180]  Because you're gonna do it again.
[18:16.360 --> 18:16.620]  No!
[18:17.180 --> 18:18.380]  What did you think?
[18:23.940 --> 18:26.520]  Did you just throw up acid spitter style?
[18:27.100 --> 18:28.340]  No, no, no. I'm good.
[18:28.840 --> 18:30.140]  I just... I did not...
[18:30.140 --> 18:31.100]  Oh god. Okay.
[18:31.620 --> 18:32.980]  Well, we're gonna be so much faster now.
[18:32.980 --> 18:34.780]  Because we get this, we go that.
[18:35.700 --> 18:39.160]  Okay, that was an odd part of it.
[18:39.540 --> 18:41.080]  The camera control is really
[18:41.080 --> 18:43.000]  giving me problems today.
[18:45.160 --> 18:46.360]  Through here.
[18:46.960 --> 18:48.000]  Drop that down.
[18:49.600 --> 18:51.780]  So where do we take the coin, I wonder?
[18:51.860 --> 18:52.920]  Do we have to buy a rope?
[18:53.820 --> 18:54.580]  I wonder?
[18:54.580 --> 18:56.540]  I think there's some shady rat merchant
[18:56.540 --> 18:58.980]  that will only trade me...
[19:00.100 --> 19:01.080]  Oh, man.
[19:01.440 --> 19:02.420]  Song never gets old.
[19:03.100 --> 19:04.340]  Just as good as the first time.
[19:05.440 --> 19:06.240]  Timeless classic.
[19:07.040 --> 19:09.100]  So, he's like, oh, go to the water faucet.
[19:09.140 --> 19:10.940]  Whatever. I think we do need to go up
[19:10.940 --> 19:12.040]  and get the coin thing again.
[19:12.460 --> 19:14.440]  I think you're right. I don't think that's part
[19:15.100 --> 19:16.100]  of a different mission.
[19:17.620 --> 19:18.240]  It has to be.
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.500]  It's gotta be.
[19:19.780 --> 19:23.360]  On the mini-map, it's kind of guiding us this way.
[19:23.880 --> 19:25.100]  We can't interact with that coin yet.
[19:25.380 --> 19:26.640]  That has to be something later.
[19:26.640 --> 19:28.440]  So, we have to go back up.
[19:29.500 --> 19:31.640]  And I bet we can go up through...
[19:31.640 --> 19:33.300]  How did we get up again? It was on the garbage can, right?
[19:33.420 --> 19:33.660]  Yeah.
[19:34.500 --> 19:36.100]  Yeah, because you just used the red
[19:36.680 --> 19:38.200]  use the red jumpy thing
[19:38.200 --> 19:40.400]  to go up. And I think that's what you do.
[19:40.540 --> 19:41.980]  Either that, or you can take the ball
[19:41.980 --> 19:43.820]  Can you use that ball somewhere else?
[19:44.440 --> 19:45.080]  I don't think so.
[19:46.140 --> 19:47.740]  Let's go to the red jumpy thing.
[19:49.140 --> 19:50.640]  And then, go across...
[19:51.380 --> 19:51.780]  Across...
[19:54.320 --> 19:56.640]  And up the wall...
[19:57.460 --> 19:58.420]  It really, I don't know,
[19:58.480 --> 20:00.580]  it's like cliffhanger when I see this.
[20:00.660 --> 20:01.700]  I think it's just like action.
[20:02.420 --> 20:04.680]  I have a feeling. Here's what I think.
[20:05.100 --> 20:06.580]  I think that we are supposed
[20:06.580 --> 20:08.280]  to activate the water tap.
[20:08.520 --> 20:09.960]  And then we're supposed to come up here.
[20:10.700 --> 20:12.260]  That's what I think is supposed to happen.
[20:12.940 --> 20:14.060]  Yeah, I think we're out of sequence.
[20:14.320 --> 20:16.780]  But, I think as long as we can use this
[20:16.780 --> 20:18.740]  ball, and knock this
[20:18.740 --> 20:20.720]  fat rat into the little hole
[20:20.720 --> 20:21.920]  or whatever, we should be fine.
[20:22.740 --> 20:24.120]  So, just keep going straight.
[20:24.960 --> 20:25.160]  Yeah.
[20:26.400 --> 20:28.720]  Luckily, we know how fast we can do this.
[20:28.840 --> 20:30.260]  Like, this is very easy, very quick.
[20:32.060 --> 20:33.700]  Can I skip this cutscene?
[20:34.980 --> 20:37.120]  Nope. Sure can't.
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.020]  Oh, man.
[20:40.100 --> 20:42.420]  Okay, I think, instead of
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.780]  jumping around and shit right now,
[20:44.980 --> 20:46.480]  I think what you need to do
[20:46.480 --> 20:48.480]  is go along...
[20:49.180 --> 20:50.700]  There are some tight ropes that take you
[20:50.700 --> 20:52.020]  over the middle of the level.
[20:52.800 --> 20:53.840]  I think you gotta...
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.740]  Look to the right.
[20:56.200 --> 20:58.680]  See that? These ropes are too close
[20:58.680 --> 20:59.680]  for you not to be using.
[21:00.060 --> 21:02.120]  You need to use this rope somehow.
[21:02.980 --> 21:03.840]  So, I'm gonna drop down.
[21:04.540 --> 21:05.260]  Yeah, exactly.
[21:06.060 --> 21:08.100]  And that will take me to where I was trying to go
[21:08.100 --> 21:09.800]  when I went back into that alleyway.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.460]  There's a cat down there, but we don't need to do anything with the cat.
[21:13.300 --> 21:14.640]  I think the cats are just
[21:14.640 --> 21:15.500]  discouraging you.
[21:16.340 --> 21:17.880]  We fucking killed that cat.
[21:18.180 --> 21:20.160]  He was trying to smash the Mises to pieces,
[21:20.380 --> 21:21.520]  so we took care of him.
[21:23.940 --> 21:25.920]  There's got to be something over here.
[21:26.040 --> 21:26.680]  You're good, you're good.
[21:27.880 --> 21:29.440]  This is really easy, this part.
[21:30.440 --> 21:32.320]  It's when you have to jump off.
[21:34.640 --> 21:35.300]  We're good.
[21:35.740 --> 21:36.580]  What's this coin?
[21:37.160 --> 21:38.380]  Yeah, there is a coin over here.
[21:39.880 --> 21:41.220]  Hang on, what's he saying?
[21:41.220 --> 21:43.120]  Hit RB. Nope, go back.
[21:43.320 --> 21:43.880]  Go back.
[21:45.320 --> 21:46.500]  Hit right bumper.
[21:50.060 --> 21:51.240]  I think we did that.
[21:51.580 --> 21:52.420]  No, I don't think we did.
[21:53.220 --> 21:53.740]  I don't think so.
[21:55.180 --> 21:56.200]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, over there.
[21:56.900 --> 21:57.720]  Why is it slippery?
[21:58.460 --> 21:59.480]  I don't know.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.400]  We got something here.
[22:02.360 --> 22:03.820]  There's things going on, this is good.
[22:05.040 --> 22:07.760]  Okay, yeah, that was a mechanic.
[22:08.000 --> 22:08.240]  Okay.
[22:08.780 --> 22:10.080]  So now we have to go
[22:10.080 --> 22:11.120]  and turn the faucet on.
[22:12.460 --> 22:13.080]  Use that.
[22:14.060 --> 22:15.500]  Why is it so slippery?
[22:15.840 --> 22:18.020]  I don't know, a bunch of birds pissed.
[22:18.380 --> 22:19.840]  Yeah, it's a bunch of bird piss.
[22:20.160 --> 22:22.820]  Okay, I think we got to go over to where the faucet is.
[22:23.360 --> 22:24.340]  And I think we got to...
[22:24.340 --> 22:26.660]  There has to be a tail whip or something we do with it.
[22:27.220 --> 22:28.240]  And then, um...
[22:28.800 --> 22:30.140]  We got to do something with that coin.
[22:30.460 --> 22:32.580]  Do you want me to go straight to the faucet?
[22:32.860 --> 22:33.760]  I think I do.
[22:34.140 --> 22:34.820]  I think I do.
[22:35.600 --> 22:36.000]  Okay.
[22:39.060 --> 22:40.300]  Let's go do that.
[22:41.680 --> 22:43.740]  I just think there has to be something...
[22:43.740 --> 22:44.660]  Go left. Yeah, there you go.
[22:44.940 --> 22:46.640]  I think there just has to be something
[22:47.380 --> 22:48.420]  with that faucet.
[22:48.480 --> 22:50.500]  We have to tail whip it, we have to get on it.
[22:50.920 --> 22:52.200]  We didn't do something.
[22:53.420 --> 22:54.340]  It's like, use a rope.
[22:55.020 --> 22:55.920]  No, I understand.
[22:56.320 --> 22:58.860]  I get it, I just don't know what...
[23:01.220 --> 23:03.320]  Can you hit the land button?
[23:03.720 --> 23:04.260]  There we go.
[23:04.260 --> 23:04.880]  So...
[23:06.960 --> 23:08.180]  I tried that earlier
[23:08.180 --> 23:09.060]  and it did not work.
[23:10.380 --> 23:12.420]  Or maybe I didn't. Maybe I just did on top.
[23:12.480 --> 23:14.120]  Oh. I don't know.
[23:14.960 --> 23:15.560]  Either way.
[23:16.720 --> 23:18.740]  Okay, now we go get...
[23:21.670 --> 23:22.030]  Okay.
[23:22.470 --> 23:23.590]  So is the coin important?
[23:23.870 --> 23:25.290]  I guess the coin isn't important.
[23:26.530 --> 23:27.350]  Well, let's go see.
[23:27.730 --> 23:29.230]  See, I don't think there's anything to do with it.
[23:29.250 --> 23:31.470]  I think you're like set in a trap.
[23:32.570 --> 23:34.130]  So I think you got to go over to
[23:34.130 --> 23:35.570]  where these coins are now.
[23:36.130 --> 23:37.730]  Yeah, you want to keep going this way.
[23:37.790 --> 23:39.610]  It's like where you started, to your right.
[23:39.990 --> 23:41.590]  Can I take a little detour?
[23:41.650 --> 23:43.430]  No! Let's just beat it!
[23:45.090 --> 23:45.450]  Why?!
[23:46.650 --> 23:48.230]  I'm afraid this is going to end.
[23:48.750 --> 23:50.270]  Yes, me too, that's great.
[23:50.770 --> 23:51.370]  End it.
[23:51.690 --> 23:53.030]  I don't want to do this again.
[23:55.470 --> 23:56.030]  Hit right bumper.
[23:56.410 --> 23:57.210]  Okay, never mind.
[23:57.790 --> 23:59.050]  No, I see where we got to go.
[23:59.170 --> 24:01.070]  I don't need to hit right bumper when I see where we got to go.
[24:01.070 --> 24:01.550]  Okay.
[24:02.510 --> 24:05.230]  Listen, I got rat vision, okay? I'm in the rat right now.
[24:06.770 --> 24:07.930]  2020 rat, bro.
[24:08.990 --> 24:09.750]  Okay, here we go.
[24:10.250 --> 24:10.970]  Oh, that's him!
[24:11.230 --> 24:11.850]  Oh, it's this idiot.
[24:12.010 --> 24:14.950]  And so we tricked him with money because he's a fucking idiot with his red converse.
[24:16.030 --> 24:18.290]  Oh, we're stealing all the fish heads.
[24:18.530 --> 24:19.250]  This is...
[24:19.250 --> 24:19.610]  Cheese.
[24:22.010 --> 24:23.950]  Wow, this rat's so smart, honestly.
[24:24.330 --> 24:24.970]  Oh, no, look out!
[24:25.050 --> 24:25.710]  It's Geoff's dog.
[24:27.530 --> 24:27.930]  Artie!
[24:27.930 --> 24:28.990]  I love Artie.
[24:31.650 --> 24:32.290]  Why would you...
[24:32.290 --> 24:33.630]  Oh, see, now we're...
[24:33.630 --> 24:37.730]  Why would you try to catch the rat in a jar with a lid?
[24:38.610 --> 24:41.470]  You're telling me that you don't try to catch rats with jars and a lid?
[24:41.570 --> 24:42.090]  Oh, my God!
[24:42.330 --> 24:43.170]  Run, Remy, run!
[24:43.670 --> 24:44.390]  Oh, no!
[24:45.030 --> 24:45.390]  Run!
[24:46.090 --> 24:47.530]  Run, Remy, run, run, run!
[24:47.650 --> 24:49.250]  You're about to get fucking rat stomped.
[24:50.430 --> 24:51.130]  Oh, my God.
[24:51.190 --> 24:52.170]  It's like Crash Bandicoot.
[24:54.110 --> 24:55.690]  Remember the last time this happened?
[24:55.690 --> 24:59.130]  It was a lady with a shotgun trying to murder us.
[24:59.430 --> 25:01.510]  Now it's this guy trying to catch you.
[25:01.610 --> 25:02.550]  Keep you as a fucking pet.
[25:04.650 --> 25:05.550]  Yeah, he's like,
[25:05.770 --> 25:07.390]  I bet you this rat knows how to cook.
[25:07.910 --> 25:08.710]  He knows.
[25:08.710 --> 25:09.750]  He knows your secrets.
[25:10.510 --> 25:11.670]  He fucking knows your secrets.
[25:13.470 --> 25:16.150]  Look at this fucking idiot slipping over the wine.
[25:17.310 --> 25:18.070]  Where are all these...
[25:18.070 --> 25:19.230]  Are these our rat friends?
[25:20.430 --> 25:20.870]  Where...
[25:20.870 --> 25:22.530]  Oh, my God.
[25:22.530 --> 25:23.390]  Holy shit.
[25:23.490 --> 25:25.010]  Where are you?
[25:25.490 --> 25:26.690]  I don't know.
[25:26.830 --> 25:29.490]  We've been over this level so many times,
[25:29.610 --> 25:30.890]  nothing looks like this.
[25:31.210 --> 25:32.970]  Look out for this last one.
[25:33.410 --> 25:34.570]  I'm dodging.
[25:35.090 --> 25:36.790]  You're locked in right now.
[25:36.870 --> 25:37.550]  You are the rat.
[25:38.630 --> 25:39.110]  Oh, shit.
[25:40.190 --> 25:41.150]  You're steaming.
[25:41.850 --> 25:42.530]  Holy shit.
[25:45.030 --> 25:45.790]  You're good.
[25:46.050 --> 25:49.490]  I'm so scared that if I fail this, we'll go back to the ten minutes.
[25:49.490 --> 25:51.710]  I don't know where our checkpoint is.
[25:51.710 --> 25:52.870]  Oh, shit.
[25:54.990 --> 25:56.310]  Get in the zone.
[25:56.590 --> 25:58.850]  Why is he working this hard to catch the rat?
[25:59.850 --> 26:00.750]  I don't know.
[26:01.650 --> 26:02.070]  Oh, shit.
[26:04.030 --> 26:05.730]  He's getting so close.
[26:05.970 --> 26:07.270]  Why is he so close?
[26:07.750 --> 26:08.690]  Go, go, go, go.
[26:10.210 --> 26:10.790]  Wait up.
[26:11.090 --> 26:12.270]  What does that mean?
[26:12.350 --> 26:13.850]  What does he mean, wait up?
[26:14.190 --> 26:16.070]  What is he trying to do?
[26:16.070 --> 26:18.290]  Yeah, he just said, hey, chef, wait up.
[26:21.950 --> 26:23.810]  Why are there all these bottles?
[26:23.890 --> 26:24.950]  Is this what France is like?
[26:24.950 --> 26:28.170]  Are there just empty bottles of wine everywhere?
[26:28.650 --> 26:29.870]  But only Paris.
[26:30.690 --> 26:32.130]  Every other city is normal.
[26:32.310 --> 26:33.310]  Paris is all fucked up.
[26:35.050 --> 26:36.230]  I love that they're like,
[26:36.450 --> 26:37.990]  what if we make these sequences
[26:37.990 --> 26:39.450]  25 minutes long?
[26:40.510 --> 26:42.070]  Yeah, we're going to make you do it
[26:42.070 --> 26:43.430]  so many times.
[26:43.430 --> 26:44.210]  Why?
[26:44.590 --> 26:45.330]  Oh, no!
[26:47.310 --> 26:49.230]  Andrew, dodge!
[26:49.330 --> 26:49.950]  Be the rat!
[26:52.090 --> 26:53.090]  That's the move.
[26:53.450 --> 26:55.110]  You see those cards?
[26:55.510 --> 26:56.430]  It's game time.
[26:58.070 --> 26:59.750]  You gotta jump, man.
[26:59.910 --> 27:01.170]  I got one health.
[27:01.290 --> 27:02.550]  Be the rat! What are you doing?
[27:03.130 --> 27:05.470]  I feel like we're doing something wrong.
[27:06.230 --> 27:06.810]  100%.
[27:07.490 --> 27:08.950]  Something's going wrong here.
[27:09.570 --> 27:10.230]  Look out for that one.
[27:10.230 --> 27:11.530]  That one's going to be coming down the middle.
[27:11.590 --> 27:13.710]  I'm dodging all of them.
[27:14.110 --> 27:14.850]  I have a weird question.
[27:14.930 --> 27:16.150]  Are we supposed to get caught?
[27:16.330 --> 27:17.190]  I don't think so.
[27:17.690 --> 27:18.930]  That's a good question, though.
[27:20.230 --> 27:21.630]  It has to be considered.
[27:21.750 --> 27:25.370]  It does have to be considered.
[27:25.610 --> 27:26.050]  No!
[27:26.710 --> 27:28.430]  This game is just insane.
[27:29.850 --> 27:31.650]  We just had to run the marathon
[27:32.030 --> 27:33.210]  with him chasing us.
[27:33.830 --> 27:36.210]  Why does he want this rat so fucking bad?
[27:38.330 --> 27:39.370]  This guy's a moron.
[27:41.170 --> 27:42.050]  The perspective...
[27:42.050 --> 27:43.810]  I don't know why we're in Remy's eye.
[27:43.910 --> 27:46.190]  Like we're in the opening of Lost.
[27:47.270 --> 27:48.550]  He looks so long.
[27:49.150 --> 27:49.930]  What the fuck?
[27:50.310 --> 27:51.110]  Is he going to help him?
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.580]  Help me with the soup!
[28:00.520 --> 28:01.280]  That's me.
[28:02.320 --> 28:04.580]  If I ever start saying sentences like that,
[28:04.740 --> 28:05.180]  commit me.
[28:06.980 --> 28:08.200]  I was about to go the other way.
[28:08.300 --> 28:10.380]  I hope I get to say that at some point in my life.
[28:10.920 --> 28:12.660]  We have very different lives.
[28:13.100 --> 28:13.820]  We do.
[28:15.120 --> 28:17.240]  This is a story about a man who gets
[28:17.240 --> 28:19.760]  CTE chasing a rat and then decides
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.000]  that they are the greatest chef of all time.
[28:22.020 --> 28:23.700]  Are you the rat that helped me
[28:23.700 --> 28:24.620]  with the soup?
[28:30.200 --> 28:32.300]  What if that was the twist that
[28:32.300 --> 28:34.620]  Remy actually doesn't know how to do anything?
[28:35.020 --> 28:35.140]  Yeah.
[28:35.160 --> 28:37.200]  It's just like he's pulling this dude's hair
[28:37.200 --> 28:38.740]  and he's just convinced.
[28:39.500 --> 28:41.660]  He's an okay cook.
[28:41.780 --> 28:42.760]  There's nothing wrong with him.
[28:42.840 --> 28:44.100]  He just doesn't have the confidence.
[28:44.600 --> 28:46.080]  So he's like, don't worry, I got this rat.
[28:48.140 --> 28:49.380]  And he's got to hide it.
[28:49.480 --> 28:50.680]  Because nobody would allow that.
[28:50.840 --> 28:52.280]  You got bonus health by the way.
[28:53.580 --> 28:54.180]  That's good.
[28:54.340 --> 28:55.700]  You got one more health container.
[28:55.880 --> 28:57.420]  I think it opens up a new way.
[28:59.100 --> 29:01.060]  I hope it doesn't get rid of the old way
[29:01.060 --> 29:01.960]  is my concern.
[29:02.820 --> 29:04.540]  We got to be able to go to the old way, right?
[29:05.520 --> 29:07.440]  Well you would assume, but
[29:07.440 --> 29:09.240]  that was sort of my
[29:10.300 --> 29:11.100]  reluctance about
[29:11.940 --> 29:13.240]  There's no way we don't
[29:13.240 --> 29:15.600]  I was going to say, there's no way we don't get to go back here.
[29:15.960 --> 29:17.640]  There's so much to explore still
[29:17.640 --> 29:18.940]  in the streets of Gay Parade.
[29:19.480 --> 29:21.120]  Now we're just back in the
[29:21.120 --> 29:23.120]  Now we're not on a time limit.
[29:23.220 --> 29:24.440]  You can do all the exploring that you want.
[29:24.900 --> 29:26.820]  So we got to get like 12 more.
[29:28.080 --> 29:29.480]  I think there's a page that
[29:29.480 --> 29:30.380]  tells us what we need.
[29:31.460 --> 29:33.020]  Because we obviously need the coins
[29:33.020 --> 29:35.080]  but I think we're also missing one of the
[29:35.080 --> 29:35.780]  mini-games?
[29:37.500 --> 29:38.600]  89 of 100.
[29:41.720 --> 29:43.400]  That's world status.
[29:44.820 --> 29:46.880]  Yeah, I guess it's just the 89 of 100.
[29:46.900 --> 29:48.620]  Oh, here we go. Total terms collected.
[29:48.800 --> 29:50.600]  This is Daring Dash.
[29:50.940 --> 29:52.240]  Yeah, I think that's it.
[29:52.380 --> 29:53.660]  We got to get the
[29:54.700 --> 29:55.560]  last ones.
[29:56.340 --> 29:57.420]  Because we did everything else.
[29:59.440 --> 30:00.000]  Yeah.
[30:00.700 --> 30:01.080]  Yeah.
[30:01.760 --> 30:03.860]  Yeah, because these are all like the other levels and stuff.
[30:05.480 --> 30:08.180]  Alright, we got to find those charms
[30:08.180 --> 30:08.760]  baby!
[30:11.940 --> 30:12.940]  We did this, right?
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.600]  We definitely did this one.
[30:15.960 --> 30:18.420]  Because that was one that we collected like...
[30:18.420 --> 30:19.600]  Oh, this is Cutting Board Calamity
[30:19.600 --> 30:20.940]  but this is like stage 3.
[30:21.300 --> 30:23.800]  So you can do more of the mini-game
[30:23.800 --> 30:25.820]  to get further. Because I think we've done
[30:26.620 --> 30:27.820]  one or two of it.
[30:28.300 --> 30:29.660]  So it would just be worth it.
[30:30.320 --> 30:31.300]  I mean, just check the
[30:32.240 --> 30:33.520]  pause menu and see if you've done it.
[30:33.640 --> 30:35.100]  But I like just doing it instead.
[30:39.940 --> 30:41.160]  Help him with the soup.
[30:45.720 --> 30:46.700]  Alright, here we go.
[30:48.140 --> 30:50.220]  It's get in there and hit the peppers.
[30:50.360 --> 30:51.620]  You got to tail whip the peppers.
[30:51.980 --> 30:53.020]  Oh, I got to break the...
[30:53.780 --> 30:54.860]  I like that you went,
[30:54.860 --> 30:56.760]  I remember this is the easiest one.
[30:56.880 --> 30:58.320]  And then you just didn't do anything.
[30:58.800 --> 31:00.700]  Well, my memory was that it was easy.
[31:00.780 --> 31:01.540]  Hit the peppers!
[31:02.240 --> 31:03.380]  Peppers don't do anything.
[31:03.580 --> 31:06.360]  The peppers explode and take out everything else around it.
[31:06.940 --> 31:08.140]  Yeah, but there's not
[31:08.140 --> 31:09.860]  a lot of stuff around them.
[31:10.280 --> 31:12.720]  Because then you can hit the pepper and then you go
[31:12.720 --> 31:14.520]  to like the next operating area.
[31:14.660 --> 31:15.300]  You're about to get fucked.
[31:16.440 --> 31:17.800]  You better start swinging.
[31:18.340 --> 31:19.460]  You better start swinging.
[31:19.940 --> 31:21.300]  We have so much time.
[31:21.300 --> 31:22.880]  Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to set
[31:22.880 --> 31:24.880]  land speed records as this rat here.
[31:26.100 --> 31:26.800]  You win.
[31:27.080 --> 31:28.820]  Could you look up
[31:28.820 --> 31:30.420]  a speedrunning website?
[31:30.820 --> 31:32.560]  See if there are any speedruns in this game.
[31:32.860 --> 31:33.820]  That's a good idea.
[31:36.780 --> 31:37.300]  Speedrun.
[31:37.680 --> 31:39.620]  I want to know how fast I need to be.
[31:39.820 --> 31:41.300]  Ratatouille 2007.
[31:42.480 --> 31:43.160]  Ratatouille series
[31:43.160 --> 31:44.360]  on speedrun.com.
[31:45.660 --> 31:46.120]  Yeah.
[31:47.320 --> 31:48.420]  Here we go.
[31:49.200 --> 31:49.920]  Ratatouille.
[31:50.280 --> 31:51.660]  Asobo has
[31:52.420 --> 31:53.780]  any percent
[31:54.660 --> 31:55.880]  console run
[31:56.640 --> 31:57.920]  21 minutes.
[31:58.040 --> 31:59.800]  Oh wow, this is actually...
[31:59.800 --> 32:01.060]  There are a lot.
[32:02.740 --> 32:04.340]  Yeah, I guess it's a Disney thing.
[32:04.540 --> 32:04.800]  Yeah.
[32:05.260 --> 32:08.060]  Let me see. Here we go.
[32:10.680 --> 32:12.240]  Okay, here's the game.
[32:12.740 --> 32:14.620]  WANU has the
[32:15.560 --> 32:16.760]  speedrun record
[32:16.760 --> 32:18.500]  of any percent of
[32:18.500 --> 32:19.840]  12 minutes 12 seconds.
[32:21.740 --> 32:22.380]  Okay.
[32:22.860 --> 32:23.960]  That's insane.
[32:24.460 --> 32:24.540]  Yeah.
[32:26.300 --> 32:28.400]  100% speedrun
[32:28.400 --> 32:29.960]  is Dimper.
[32:30.200 --> 32:31.740]  You know it's dimper, bro.
[32:32.100 --> 32:35.060]  And it's 1 hour 30 minutes 28 seconds.
[32:36.740 --> 32:37.380]  Damn.
[32:39.220 --> 32:40.820]  I'm going to go to this thing
[32:40.820 --> 32:41.920]  that I was talking about before.
[32:42.040 --> 32:42.360]  Yeah.
[32:42.360 --> 32:43.140]  Yeah.
[32:43.980 --> 32:46.360]  Do it. I mean, we're not beating Dimper's time
[32:46.360 --> 32:48.060]  clearly, but...
[32:48.060 --> 32:50.780]  I'm feeling good about this.
[32:51.080 --> 32:55.440]  What is this?
[32:56.620 --> 32:57.700]  Home stink home?
[32:58.140 --> 32:58.280]  No.
[32:59.500 --> 33:01.260]  That's to go back to...
[33:01.840 --> 33:02.240]  Oh, the cat.
[33:02.880 --> 33:04.280]  Steph Curry cat.
[33:06.140 --> 33:07.400]  Yeah, why can't he be more
[33:07.400 --> 33:08.400]  like a Clay Thompson cat?
[33:09.860 --> 33:11.080]  Clay Thompson is
[33:11.080 --> 33:12.660]  like 32 years old.
[33:12.660 --> 33:13.600]  It's insane.
[33:14.520 --> 33:15.780]  He's also done.
[33:17.500 --> 33:17.900]  Yeah.
[33:18.960 --> 33:20.640]  I hope he has fun playing in an
[33:20.640 --> 33:21.520]  international league.
[33:24.080 --> 33:24.880]  Where is...
[33:24.880 --> 33:26.660]  Are you sneaking or are you just
[33:26.660 --> 33:27.240]  like jaunting?
[33:27.480 --> 33:30.060]  I think it's because it's mud or something.
[33:30.060 --> 33:32.340]  Oh, okay. I thought you were just like doing a jaunt.
[33:33.360 --> 33:33.760]  No.
[33:35.640 --> 33:36.920]  I'm going to the menu.
[33:37.400 --> 33:38.300]  I want to see what the menu is
[33:38.300 --> 33:39.640]  because I don't think that was here before.
[33:39.640 --> 33:40.740]  What's springboard race?
[33:42.400 --> 33:43.520]  We'll see in a minute.
[33:43.960 --> 33:47.860]  Oh, it's another...
[33:47.860 --> 33:48.640]  Whatever this is.
[33:49.260 --> 33:50.580]  That's Daring Dash Stage 2.
[33:50.820 --> 33:52.160]  Daring Dash Stage 2.
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.780]  Haven't done that. I think we've only done one.
[33:56.120 --> 33:57.680]  Let's try it and see if it adds
[33:57.680 --> 33:58.660]  a 2 upon completion.
[33:59.700 --> 34:00.740]  It's also like...
[34:01.220 --> 34:02.720]  Let's do it. Let's try it.
[34:03.200 --> 34:05.680]  This is what you need to do for the 100%.
[34:06.180 --> 34:07.500]  We're doing this so you guys
[34:07.500 --> 34:08.600]  don't have to experiment at home.
[34:08.900 --> 34:11.820]  Are there any 100%
[34:11.820 --> 34:13.760]  speedruns? Yes, there are 100%
[34:13.760 --> 34:14.360]  speedruns.
[34:15.660 --> 34:17.540]  That's Dimper. Dimper is
[34:17.540 --> 34:19.240]  the category leader at
[34:20.120 --> 34:21.620]  1 hour 30 minutes
[34:21.620 --> 34:22.400]  28 seconds.
[34:23.580 --> 34:24.880]  Oh, I hate this one.
[34:26.940 --> 34:27.560]  Middle.
[34:28.360 --> 34:28.980]  Left.
[34:29.480 --> 34:30.180]  And then stick left.
[34:30.760 --> 34:32.340]  There you go.
[34:32.760 --> 34:34.480]  And then up.
[34:34.480 --> 34:35.320]  Far.
[34:37.780 --> 34:38.860]  Went too far.
[34:39.580 --> 34:40.620]  Got stuck in the trees.
[34:42.320 --> 34:45.680]  There you go. Left.
[34:46.300 --> 34:46.980]  You're alright.
[34:47.220 --> 34:49.720]  Now it's time to go right.
[34:50.500 --> 34:51.820]  You're alright. Halfway.
[34:52.040 --> 34:53.520]  Is there a way that I have to collect all of them?
[34:53.900 --> 34:55.680]  You only have to get 6 more.
[34:56.020 --> 34:58.080]  5 more. 4 more.
[34:58.680 --> 35:00.240]  You're almost there. 3 more.
[35:00.660 --> 35:02.420]  2 more. 1 more.
[35:02.980 --> 35:03.620]  Get up there.
[35:03.660 --> 35:04.200]  Get up there.
[35:05.680 --> 35:06.000]  Easy.
[35:08.840 --> 35:10.220]  Look at him. And you got
[35:10.220 --> 35:10.900]  the cream.
[35:12.160 --> 35:12.480]  Congratulations.
[35:14.280 --> 35:16.220]  We hadn't done that one yet because you got the cream.
[35:16.640 --> 35:16.800]  No.
[35:19.900 --> 35:20.220]  Dimper,
[35:20.360 --> 35:21.920]  you think you're the only one?
[35:25.940 --> 35:28.520]  We're going to play a bunch of weird games, I imagine, over time.
[35:28.580 --> 35:30.340]  We should try to get into the top 10 of one of them.
[35:30.340 --> 35:31.200]  You think so?
[35:31.300 --> 35:34.040]  There has to be something obscure enough for us to play.
[35:34.220 --> 35:36.220]  Like a crazy speedrun one that we can do?
[35:36.720 --> 35:36.920]  Yeah.
[35:38.360 --> 35:39.480]  That's not actually fast.
[35:39.560 --> 35:42.300]  I will say, there's only
[35:42.300 --> 35:44.100]  6 100%
[35:45.300 --> 35:45.780]  runs.
[35:48.560 --> 35:50.400]  If we knew how to
[35:50.400 --> 35:51.880]  properly time
[35:53.180 --> 35:54.080]  this game,
[35:54.400 --> 35:55.820]  we could do that.
[35:56.200 --> 35:58.240]  It would also mean I'd have to do it in one sitting.
[35:58.240 --> 35:58.580]  Yes.
[35:58.760 --> 36:01.040]  Which would be terrible.
[36:01.520 --> 36:03.300]  That would take a while.
[36:06.740 --> 36:07.540]  Lightbulb Bundle.
[36:08.180 --> 36:09.120]  Let's do this.
[36:09.440 --> 36:10.700]  You know what the sad part is?
[36:10.820 --> 36:13.780]  Dimper is that one hour, 30 minutes, 28 seconds.
[36:13.900 --> 36:16.020]  Second place is Xander721.
[36:16.280 --> 36:17.820]  One hour, 33 minutes.
[36:18.460 --> 36:19.200]  And it's like...
[36:19.200 --> 36:22.320]  You missed it by two and a half, three minutes.
[36:22.520 --> 36:23.360]  That's rough.
[36:24.540 --> 36:25.860]  You never get to time that.
[36:25.940 --> 36:27.340]  In speedrunning time,
[36:27.440 --> 36:28.300]  that is forever.
[36:30.320 --> 36:31.520]  Wow, I really should have
[36:31.520 --> 36:32.460]  read what I just clicked.
[36:32.640 --> 36:34.320]  I thought the same thing.
[36:35.340 --> 36:36.920]  I think you have to hit the bulbs.
[36:37.120 --> 36:38.180]  I got sucked up in the speedrun.
[36:38.380 --> 36:40.120]  Something about hitting X with the bulbs.
[36:44.200 --> 36:45.160]  Maybe that's what
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.320]  that thing was for.
[36:46.960 --> 36:48.200]  You know what I mean? We're good.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.400]  Oh, the bulbs in the lights at the top!
[36:51.400 --> 36:52.220]  Oh!
[36:53.680 --> 36:54.600]  Look at you, big brains.
[36:55.020 --> 36:56.780]  This is the wrong way, but good work.
[36:57.480 --> 36:59.480]  Big brain while I'm going completely
[36:59.480 --> 37:00.200]  in the wrong way.
[37:00.440 --> 37:03.200]  I mean it in the
[37:03.200 --> 37:04.040]  meanest way possible.
[37:06.980 --> 37:07.940]  Where is...
[37:07.940 --> 37:08.620]  Right there.
[37:11.720 --> 37:13.600]  All this shit looks the same.
[37:13.760 --> 37:15.100]  Yes, it does. Everything is
[37:15.100 --> 37:16.740]  covered in a blue fucking tarp.
[37:19.220 --> 37:20.120]  Also, this is
[37:20.120 --> 37:21.060]  a huge tarp.
[37:21.260 --> 37:24.000]  Oh! There's one in here.
[37:24.620 --> 37:25.920]  That's what this is. There's one
[37:25.920 --> 37:27.720]  in here, there's one in the back of that
[37:27.720 --> 37:30.080]  box truck, and then we have to
[37:30.080 --> 37:31.100]  find the third one.
[37:34.160 --> 37:35.780]  Do you like tail whip it?
[37:36.200 --> 37:36.780]  What's going on?
[37:37.740 --> 37:38.300]  What's happening?
[37:38.840 --> 37:39.640]  I don't know.
[37:40.940 --> 37:42.280]  I can't do anything here.
[37:45.760 --> 37:47.020]  I can't smell it.
[37:47.740 --> 37:49.040]  That did damage.
[37:52.660 --> 37:54.760]  Three of three bulbs left.
[37:54.920 --> 37:56.320]  There's that thing over there.
[37:59.460 --> 38:00.000]  Oh!
[38:00.740 --> 38:03.080]  You have to lure the mobs away?
[38:03.360 --> 38:03.760]  Yeah.
[38:04.480 --> 38:06.300]  I have to go to that thing over there.
[38:12.280 --> 38:13.940]  You have to lure them and
[38:13.940 --> 38:14.600]  then you go get them.
[38:16.280 --> 38:17.380]  That's right, Remi.
[38:19.300 --> 38:21.360]  What is your favorite
[38:21.360 --> 38:22.400]  Patton Oswalt thing?
[38:23.460 --> 38:25.160]  I like that thing in King of Queens
[38:25.160 --> 38:27.280]  where he stood really still in that scene.
[38:27.660 --> 38:28.980]  I think that's pretty good.
[38:29.900 --> 38:30.940]  You think this is his best work?
[38:31.140 --> 38:32.860]  Yeah, I mean, to be able to
[38:33.520 --> 38:34.000]  know
[38:36.780 --> 38:37.740]  what you're
[38:37.740 --> 38:38.180]  doing
[38:38.860 --> 38:41.140]  and how and all that stuff, I think
[38:41.140 --> 38:43.600]  that's very...
[38:43.600 --> 38:44.640]  I think it's very cool
[38:45.280 --> 38:46.300]  to know that stuff.
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.080]  Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus.
[38:56.700 --> 38:57.240]  Fuckin' run.
[38:57.380 --> 38:58.820]  You got it, you got it. You're alright, you're alright.
[39:04.340 --> 39:05.620]  There you go. And then you got to jump up
[39:05.620 --> 39:06.240]  there and tail whip it?
[39:06.580 --> 39:08.120]  Yeah, you were way too slow.
[39:10.980 --> 39:11.960]  I love that they came back.
[39:12.500 --> 39:13.460]  I think that
[39:14.120 --> 39:16.160]  Patton Oswalt's best stuff was the
[39:20.520 --> 39:22.240]  anti-comedians of comedy thing
[39:22.240 --> 39:24.060]  or whatever, with him and Brian Pessain
[39:24.060 --> 39:25.080]  and Ryan Bamford and stuff.
[39:25.800 --> 39:27.600]  And Zach Galifianakis.
[39:27.840 --> 39:29.520]  I thought that was so fuckin'... I loved that.
[39:30.600 --> 39:31.940]  When they were doing that stuff.
[39:32.120 --> 39:32.960]  I thought that was fantastic.
[39:33.920 --> 39:35.620]  I've seen the documentary for that.
[39:35.620 --> 39:37.620]  I never watched them perform
[39:37.620 --> 39:38.340]  outside of that.
[39:39.480 --> 39:41.100]  There's a lot of really good stuff.
[39:42.940 --> 39:43.880]  Patton Oswalt's
[39:43.880 --> 39:45.580]  stand-up from that time I felt was
[39:45.580 --> 39:46.800]  really, really, really good.
[39:48.400 --> 39:49.360]  Zach Galifianakis
[39:49.360 --> 39:51.140]  live at the Purple Onion was really good.
[39:51.380 --> 39:52.880]  There's all these...
[39:52.880 --> 39:54.860]  It's cool because it's almost like
[39:56.620 --> 39:57.560]  band stuff
[39:57.560 --> 39:59.440]  where there are these bootleg recordings
[39:59.440 --> 40:01.100]  of sets that they would do and everything.
[40:01.900 --> 40:03.560]  Finding those was always really cool.
[40:03.560 --> 40:04.900]  Yeah, that was always a lot of fun.
[40:05.260 --> 40:07.040]  Alright, so now what do you do? You go over here
[40:07.040 --> 40:07.940]  and then what's the plan?
[40:09.580 --> 40:10.920]  I'm gonna just try...
[40:10.920 --> 40:13.120]  Oh! Above... Fuck!
[40:13.200 --> 40:15.180]  Yeah, did you not see that?
[40:15.320 --> 40:16.500]  I thought you knew that. No, I didn't.
[40:18.160 --> 40:18.720]  There you go.
[40:21.820 --> 40:22.920]  And now I think...
[40:22.920 --> 40:25.460]  I don't know why the mobs
[40:25.460 --> 40:26.840]  have to be away to do that.
[40:27.840 --> 40:29.560]  Yeah, I don't...
[40:31.140 --> 40:31.720]  Okay, so
[40:31.720 --> 40:32.460]  the box truck
[40:34.640 --> 40:35.420]  is where we're going.
[40:35.520 --> 40:37.040]  Do you think I gotta bring that thing with me?
[40:38.760 --> 40:39.120]  Uh...
[40:39.840 --> 40:41.820]  What thing? No, I don't think so.
[40:41.960 --> 40:42.920]  It seems like it's too far.
[40:43.040 --> 40:43.980]  You think there'll be a different lure?
[40:46.880 --> 40:47.980]  Oh, I hate the mud.
[40:49.800 --> 40:50.880]  Do you ever see Big Fan?
[40:51.380 --> 40:53.340]  No, I never watched that.
[40:53.380 --> 40:53.820]  Was it good?
[40:55.440 --> 40:57.100]  I really wanted to like it.
[40:57.100 --> 40:58.640]  I like the idea of it a lot.
[40:58.820 --> 41:01.140]  But, um...
[41:01.140 --> 41:02.420]  Yeah, I don't remember it being great.
[41:04.860 --> 41:05.900]  Oh, boy. Okay.
[41:07.740 --> 41:08.920]  Yep, there's a lure.
[41:09.140 --> 41:10.040]  Yeah, see, there's a lure here.
[41:10.040 --> 41:13.280]  Did you say you have to retrieve three lightbulbs for the carny?
[41:13.920 --> 41:14.840]  Are we doing this for a carny?
[41:15.100 --> 41:16.180]  No, for the colony.
[41:16.720 --> 41:18.660]  Oh. I heard carny.
[41:19.120 --> 41:20.040]  This is for Art Carny.
[41:21.760 --> 41:23.140]  Art Carny needs these bulbs
[41:23.140 --> 41:23.980]  and he needs them now.
[41:23.980 --> 41:25.300]  Alright, twist it.
[41:26.240 --> 41:27.840]  There you go. Boom. Get it. Boom.
[41:28.100 --> 41:30.820]  Okay, now where do we think the third...
[41:30.820 --> 41:32.700]  Where do we think the last bulb is?
[41:33.020 --> 41:33.900]  I'm just gonna...
[41:33.900 --> 41:35.340]  Okay, don't hit me.
[41:35.700 --> 41:38.160]  I'm gonna go the, uh...
[41:38.160 --> 41:40.540]  The pamphlet thing, I think is where it is.
[41:41.080 --> 41:41.920]  On the mini-map.
[41:44.220 --> 41:46.080]  So, I'm gonna go up here again.
[41:46.900 --> 41:48.280]  Oh! It's up there!
[41:48.360 --> 41:49.620]  Look, straight up. That's it.
[41:49.820 --> 41:52.200]  It's, uh, the, um...
[41:52.200 --> 41:53.920]  The gutter, right? That we were at before?
[41:54.220 --> 41:56.340]  Yes, and, like, the umbrella where, like, the wind
[41:56.340 --> 41:58.340]  shoots you up and we ended up going over there
[41:58.340 --> 42:00.000]  and going, what the fuck is this?
[42:00.040 --> 42:01.820]  And it's that. Got it.
[42:01.980 --> 42:03.780]  Um, do we go this way for it?
[42:03.960 --> 42:05.040]  I don't remember how we...
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.520]  Just cause we're gonna...
[42:07.520 --> 42:09.980]  This'll take us all the way to the top
[42:09.980 --> 42:11.440]  and then I think
[42:11.840 --> 42:13.900]  it's over to, like, the...
[42:13.900 --> 42:14.500]  left?
[42:16.400 --> 42:17.800]  I think we have to go to the other side.
[42:18.740 --> 42:19.000]  Okay.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.620]  I think it's straight across.
[42:22.520 --> 42:23.020]  Okay.
[42:23.540 --> 42:25.020]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, we got this.
[42:25.780 --> 42:26.960]  Were you a big
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.140]  E3 watcher?
[42:29.400 --> 42:30.880]  You watch, like, the press conferences?
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.120]  No, I...
[42:33.120 --> 42:35.160]  Every time I went to E3, I ended up not
[42:35.160 --> 42:35.920]  enjoying it.
[42:38.640 --> 42:39.640]  It's so...
[42:39.640 --> 42:41.180]  Oh, I've been to E3 so many times.
[42:41.940 --> 42:42.800]  Really? Oh, yeah.
[42:42.800 --> 42:43.160]  Oh, wow.
[42:43.700 --> 42:47.360]  Like, it's fun,
[42:47.360 --> 42:49.220]  but the fun of it is mostly
[42:49.220 --> 42:50.940]  hanging out with your friends and seeing this stuff.
[42:51.460 --> 42:53.220]  It's not... Like, waiting in line
[42:53.220 --> 42:55.380]  to play a game that you're gonna play in, like, four months
[42:55.380 --> 42:57.100]  is, like, not super thrilling, or
[42:57.820 --> 42:59.060]  to have, like, the super
[42:59.060 --> 43:00.340]  handheld, like,
[43:01.740 --> 43:03.140]  Ubisoft experience of it all is just
[43:03.140 --> 43:04.200]  sort of, like, lame.
[43:06.380 --> 43:06.740]  But...
[43:08.080 --> 43:08.800]  Like, it...
[43:09.260 --> 43:10.380]  It's a bummer that it's gone.
[43:11.080 --> 43:13.320]  As much as I didn't, like,
[43:13.360 --> 43:14.840]  love it... Yeah, no, you gotta jump across that way.
[43:15.440 --> 43:16.980]  Is that not it? And you jump up
[43:16.980 --> 43:17.820]  and you go up the pipe.
[43:18.360 --> 43:18.720]  Yeah.
[43:20.820 --> 43:22.240]  Yeah, as much as...
[43:22.680 --> 43:24.940]  As much as I didn't, you know, love going
[43:24.940 --> 43:26.780]  and whatever, I think that there's
[43:26.780 --> 43:28.900]  a big hole in video game
[43:28.900 --> 43:31.060]  stuff right now where...
[43:31.060 --> 43:33.060]  You know, it's just not...
[43:33.060 --> 43:33.920]  It's, like, not the same.
[43:35.720 --> 43:36.380]  Oh, yeah.
[43:36.960 --> 43:38.800]  Go, go, go, go. All the way.
[43:38.940 --> 43:39.640]  All the way. Go left.
[43:40.820 --> 43:42.180]  You got it. You got it.
[43:42.180 --> 43:43.680]  Okay, now you're gonna hit forward right.
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.540]  There you go. There you go.
[43:46.140 --> 43:47.140]  All the way, all the way, all the way.
[43:47.400 --> 43:49.180]  Keep it going.
[43:50.360 --> 43:52.180]  You're gonna make it there. You're gonna jump across
[43:52.180 --> 43:53.540]  all of those. Don't forget to land.
[43:54.060 --> 43:55.120]  Don't look down, baby.
[43:55.780 --> 43:57.960]  That's how you get that cheevo right there. That's how you
[43:57.960 --> 43:59.420]  fucking do it. You're welcome.
[43:59.900 --> 44:01.700]  Go do it at home right now on your game.
[44:02.540 --> 44:04.160]  Okay, jump up there. Fucking tail
[44:04.160 --> 44:06.200]  whip that thing. There you go.
[44:06.380 --> 44:08.140]  Get that... That's it. Done.
[44:08.840 --> 44:10.520]  Done. That's how you beat it, baby.
[44:10.520 --> 44:12.060]  Hell yeah.
[44:13.600 --> 44:14.680]  Lightbulb bundle
[44:14.680 --> 44:15.900]  mission complete.
[44:18.420 --> 44:18.980]  Minigame
[44:18.980 --> 44:20.500]  stages complete. Four of nine.
[44:20.660 --> 44:22.500]  Oh my god. We're missing
[44:22.500 --> 44:24.440]  five minigame stages in this thing?
[44:24.500 --> 44:26.520]  What the fuck? How are we
[44:26.520 --> 44:27.960]  missing nine? Or five?
[44:28.620 --> 44:29.240]  How are there nine?
[44:31.620 --> 44:32.280]  I was just
[44:32.280 --> 44:34.380]  ringing up. On Wednesday
[44:34.380 --> 44:36.700]  we're unfortunately busy. You're gonna miss it.
[44:37.060 --> 44:38.500]  I'm gonna have us watch the
[44:39.180 --> 44:40.660]  2004 Xbox press conference.
[44:41.020 --> 44:42.160]  Oh, that's awesome!
[44:42.360 --> 44:43.980]  I'm so bummed I'm missing that. Fuck.
[44:44.600 --> 44:45.500]  How long is it?
[44:46.720 --> 44:48.300]  I think it's like 70 minutes.
[44:48.720 --> 44:49.920]  But it's the
[44:50.460 --> 44:52.340]  E3 right before Halo 2 comes out.
[44:52.540 --> 44:54.180]  So I'm sure Geoff is gonna have
[44:54.180 --> 44:55.040]  a lot of stories.
[44:56.900 --> 44:57.860]  Maybe I'll try
[44:58.320 --> 44:59.780]  to move some stuff and see if I can be there.
[44:59.900 --> 45:01.060]  That sounds like it's gonna be fun.
[45:01.700 --> 45:03.700]  I would love to be there for that. That's so funny.
[45:05.500 --> 45:06.360]  Home stink home.
[45:06.360 --> 45:08.320]  Did we do that? That's how you get back to your
[45:08.320 --> 45:10.280]  courtyard. Oh.
[45:10.980 --> 45:11.380]  Yeah.
[45:11.820 --> 45:14.400]  That's why it says it if you stopped and read
[45:14.400 --> 45:16.180]  the words. Time challenge.
[45:16.360 --> 45:17.480]  Gusteau chase.
[45:18.540 --> 45:20.300]  I'm pretty sure we did that. I'm in minigame mode.
[45:20.660 --> 45:22.120]  Yeah, no, I guess. That's what I'm trying to see.
[45:23.980 --> 45:24.380]  Little
[45:24.380 --> 45:25.800]  chef, big kitchen assistant.
[45:28.540 --> 45:29.740]  No, I don't think we have.
[45:30.240 --> 45:32.360]  Keep going. I don't see anything about
[45:32.360 --> 45:34.240]  Gusteau. There's too many here
[45:34.240 --> 45:35.740]  that don't belong on this level.
[45:36.900 --> 45:37.260]  So.
[45:41.900 --> 45:43.740]  No, I'm not. I guess.
[45:43.800 --> 45:45.700]  Let's try it. But I also don't think it's a minigame.
[45:49.810 --> 45:51.730]  Oh my god. It's like you have to run a
[45:51.730 --> 45:52.990]  certain range to
[45:55.870 --> 45:57.730]  It's a timed challenge. I don't think this is a
[45:57.730 --> 45:59.770]  minigame. Oh, we did this. Yeah, I know.
[45:59.850 --> 46:01.610]  This. Yeah. Fuck.
[46:02.030 --> 46:03.790]  Yeah. Exit the
[46:03.790 --> 46:05.730]  sewer. I don't want to go
[46:05.730 --> 46:07.670]  all the way back to the sewer. Yeah, you'd rather do
[46:07.670 --> 46:09.650]  this for two minutes. All right. Well,
[46:10.170 --> 46:11.670]  what's your, while you're doing
[46:11.670 --> 46:13.690]  this, I guess, what's your experience with E3
[46:13.690 --> 46:14.250]  in general?
[46:15.810 --> 46:17.810]  I just, I love watching the press conferences.
[46:17.970 --> 46:19.750]  I miss the press conferences. Yeah. I never went.
[46:20.330 --> 46:21.890]  They didn't open it to the public.
[46:22.050 --> 46:23.770]  I think they did it for two years and then it
[46:23.770 --> 46:25.070]  closed. Yeah. Also,
[46:25.810 --> 46:27.710]  also the thing where it's like, oh, it was never open
[46:27.710 --> 46:29.210]  to like the public is such
[46:30.590 --> 46:31.830]  like bullshit because
[46:31.830 --> 46:33.670]  if you worked at like GameStop,
[46:33.670 --> 46:35.870]  you could go. If you worked at Blockbuster,
[46:36.070 --> 46:37.670]  you could go. Like, it was
[46:37.670 --> 46:39.290]  so easy to get
[46:40.170 --> 46:40.570]  credentials.
[46:41.870 --> 46:43.590]  I feel like everyone, I feel like
[46:43.590 --> 46:45.750]  everyone did it. I feel like everyone
[46:45.750 --> 46:47.730]  did it. So, it was just one of those
[46:47.730 --> 46:49.830]  things and uh, I don't know.
[46:49.990 --> 46:51.730]  It, it's
[46:51.730 --> 46:53.150]  crazy because it was such,
[46:54.190 --> 46:55.630]  it was such a sign
[46:55.630 --> 46:57.270]  of the times kind of thing where
[46:59.090 --> 46:59.650]  it was
[46:59.650 --> 47:01.170]  so expensive
[47:02.050 --> 47:03.090]  inside of there
[47:03.090 --> 47:04.390]  where it was like, yeah, we,
[47:05.050 --> 47:07.010]  the one that I remember was like Mafia
[47:07.630 --> 47:09.150]  2 or like, I think it was
[47:09.150 --> 47:11.130]  Mafia 2 and it's like, yeah, check it out.
[47:11.250 --> 47:12.530]  We made like a whole
[47:13.070 --> 47:14.470]  New Orleans like
[47:15.390 --> 47:16.990]  big, easy, like these,
[47:17.550 --> 47:18.610]  like they made like a
[47:19.130 --> 47:21.150]  city street in the middle of the convention center
[47:21.150 --> 47:22.850]  where people were like throwing beads
[47:22.850 --> 47:25.150]  and like a band, like a marching
[47:25.150 --> 47:26.730]  band would play and stuff and I'm like,
[47:27.150 --> 47:29.050]  that's so dumb. I'm like, do you think
[47:29.050 --> 47:31.090]  this is what, I'm getting pumped
[47:31.090 --> 47:32.910]  on like Mafia 3 or whatever?
[47:33.010 --> 47:35.250]  Like, I don't know. To me, it's just that kind of stuff.
[47:35.390 --> 47:37.030]  Hey, congrats, you won, Andrew. Way to go, dude.
[47:37.870 --> 47:38.510]  Yeah, congrats.
[47:39.870 --> 47:41.370]  Well, you're up here now. Is that something?
[47:41.830 --> 47:42.630]  Yeah, sure.
[47:42.950 --> 47:44.750]  I mean, there's probably stuff up here we missed.
[47:45.170 --> 47:45.450]  Maybe.
[47:46.730 --> 47:48.970]  Yeah, that to me was like the biggest thing
[47:48.970 --> 47:50.990]  of E3 where it was just like, wow,
[47:51.410 --> 47:52.870]  it's like a lot of like money spent
[47:52.870 --> 47:54.810]  on some stupid stuff, you know what I mean?
[47:55.710 --> 47:56.890]  I don't think we've done that,
[47:56.890 --> 47:57.690]  whatever that is.
[47:59.010 --> 48:00.590]  Yeah, yeah, give it a shot.
[48:00.770 --> 48:02.790]  You gotta go through, you gotta grab a ball
[48:02.790 --> 48:04.330]  or whatever and go through that thing.
[48:04.750 --> 48:06.850]  Don't we? I don't think I even need to.
[48:07.230 --> 48:08.870]  Oh, really? I can just do this.
[48:12.170 --> 48:12.690]  I had enough.
[48:13.490 --> 48:14.970]  I bet you if I double jump,
[48:15.230 --> 48:16.590]  I'll burn. Nope. Okay.
[48:17.170 --> 48:18.170]  Well, we tried.
[48:19.530 --> 48:20.730]  Where you go that way? Maybe if I go over here.
[48:20.890 --> 48:20.990]  Yep.
[48:23.410 --> 48:24.850]  Oh! You're gonna die. Fuck.
[48:25.470 --> 48:26.630]  Yeah, I'm going back.
[48:27.550 --> 48:28.430]  You died well.
[48:28.910 --> 48:29.150]  No!
[48:31.630 --> 48:32.590]  Oh, this fucking...
[48:32.590 --> 48:32.910]  No!
[48:35.370 --> 48:37.050]  I mean, what did you think, bud?
[48:37.810 --> 48:38.470]  That's the...
[48:38.470 --> 48:40.050]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:40.170 --> 48:41.670]  I know.
[48:44.570 --> 48:46.070]  What was I gonna say?
[48:47.110 --> 48:48.850]  Yeah, like you'd hear journalists
[48:48.850 --> 48:50.950]  and stuff talk about how dumb all that stuff was,
[48:51.010 --> 48:52.490]  but I loved it as a viewer.
[48:53.130 --> 48:54.950]  It's just such an extravagant
[48:54.950 --> 48:56.410]  waste of time and money.
[48:56.490 --> 48:58.470]  Uh, there was one year...
[48:58.470 --> 48:59.390]  Let me see if I can look it up.
[49:00.850 --> 49:02.330]  My friend Sean
[49:03.730 --> 49:04.170]  went...
[49:04.170 --> 49:05.150]  is for Mega64.
[49:06.690 --> 49:08.490]  And, let me see...
[49:10.330 --> 49:10.770]  He...
[49:10.770 --> 49:12.310]  You know, the thing that we'd always dog him on
[49:12.310 --> 49:13.010]  was like...
[49:13.870 --> 49:16.330]  E3 or whatever was like, oh, this is like professionals
[49:16.330 --> 49:16.870]  or whatever.
[49:18.730 --> 49:20.230]  And Sean went one year
[49:20.230 --> 49:22.150]  and there was just a bounce
[49:22.150 --> 49:24.410]  house, like a bounce castle
[49:24.410 --> 49:26.250]  that had like, jump in this
[49:26.250 --> 49:27.810]  with these women.
[49:29.010 --> 49:30.450]  And that was like the whole
[49:30.990 --> 49:31.430]  thing.
[49:31.910 --> 49:34.270]  And I think Sean filmed it and then we put it out
[49:34.270 --> 49:36.210]  on YouTube or something and it was the thing
[49:36.210 --> 49:38.490]  that everyone pointed to and they're like, oh yeah, for professionals,
[49:38.750 --> 49:38.850]  huh?
[49:39.610 --> 49:40.370]  It was great.
[49:41.510 --> 49:43.730]  It was pretty fucking cool.
[49:43.730 --> 49:45.390]  Like they hired women to just bounce in the house?
[49:45.390 --> 49:48.230]  Oh, yeah! But that was...
[49:48.230 --> 49:48.690]  That was great.
[49:49.330 --> 49:50.790]  That's so dumb.
[49:52.850 --> 49:53.850]  It was fucking
[49:53.850 --> 49:54.790]  phenomenal.
[49:56.050 --> 49:58.030]  You ever see the photos of when they like
[49:58.030 --> 49:59.590]  demoed the DS?
[50:00.170 --> 50:02.190]  They like, handcuffed it to women?
[50:02.310 --> 50:02.690]  Oh, yeah!
[50:03.990 --> 50:04.930]  Oh, I remember.
[50:05.030 --> 50:06.110]  It's insane.
[50:06.470 --> 50:09.850]  Conventions in general were just, they were like that, man.
[50:09.890 --> 50:11.870]  It was fucking weird. I remember going to PAX
[50:11.870 --> 50:13.050]  and there was like a NAS.
[50:13.450 --> 50:16.170]  And it was just like...
[50:16.170 --> 50:17.590]  These women handing out NAS?
[50:18.670 --> 50:19.190]  Like...
[50:19.190 --> 50:21.570]  Very scantily clad. Again,
[50:22.630 --> 50:23.910]  I'm not trying to be
[50:23.910 --> 50:24.750]  prudish.
[50:25.610 --> 50:27.770]  But it was just like,
[50:27.850 --> 50:30.210]  oh, this is not for the product.
[50:30.390 --> 50:31.250]  This is gross.
[50:32.270 --> 50:34.050]  Yes. These people are gross.
[50:34.490 --> 50:35.190]  This is sad.
[50:36.390 --> 50:38.090]  The idea of like, these fucking
[50:38.090 --> 50:39.730]  idiots are gonna buy this thing because
[50:39.730 --> 50:41.770]  scantily clad women is handing it out.
[50:41.990 --> 50:42.970]  You win. You already did this one.
[50:44.070 --> 50:45.150]  I don't, I checked.
[50:45.270 --> 50:46.250]  I didn't. Yeah, you did.
[50:46.470 --> 50:49.150]  I looked. No, you did it. Well, then there's no indicator
[50:49.150 --> 50:51.430]  of which ones I've done and which I haven't.
[50:51.470 --> 50:52.050]  Yeah, you did it.
[50:54.250 --> 50:55.030]  Yeah, you did it.
[50:55.890 --> 50:56.830]  I was gonna ask,
[50:56.930 --> 50:58.430]  you were at PAX 2009.
[50:59.210 --> 51:00.770]  I think it was the subreddit somebody posted.
[51:00.910 --> 51:03.110]  The prank war video. Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah.
[51:04.130 --> 51:05.070]  You and Rooster Teeth.
[51:05.350 --> 51:07.550]  Did you get swine flu at that PAX?
[51:07.870 --> 51:08.230]  No!
[51:09.070 --> 51:10.850]  I got it. Did you really?
[51:10.850 --> 51:12.770]  I was gonna say, I feel like we know someone who did.
[51:12.970 --> 51:14.770]  Did you? Did you get like really
[51:14.770 --> 51:15.610]  fucking sick at that one?
[51:16.750 --> 51:18.710]  I was so sick. One of the
[51:18.710 --> 51:20.710]  sickest I've been outside of like
[51:20.710 --> 51:22.770]  getting COVID later. But yeah, oh my
[51:22.770 --> 51:24.710]  God. That was miserable.
[51:25.630 --> 51:26.070]  Miserable.
[51:26.630 --> 51:28.470]  And I don't understand how like everybody
[51:28.470 --> 51:30.430]  didn't get it. Yeah, I think it's
[51:30.430 --> 51:32.750]  I think it has to do with like
[51:32.750 --> 51:34.770]  luck. I think your luck is just
[51:35.650 --> 51:36.850]  unfortunately pretty low.
[51:37.810 --> 51:38.390]  Oh, yeah.
[51:38.390 --> 51:39.930]  I think that's
[51:40.370 --> 51:42.330]  just what it is. Did you just see that
[51:42.330 --> 51:44.210]  across the way and go, that must be the thing I need to get?
[51:45.870 --> 51:46.190]  Yep.
[51:46.810 --> 51:48.130]  It's just like, how do I get there?
[51:48.350 --> 51:49.830]  Yeah, I mean, I think you have to like
[51:50.610 --> 51:52.710]  glide across, like you have to go like all the way around
[51:54.030 --> 51:54.670]  and uh...
[51:54.670 --> 51:54.890]  Yeah.
[51:56.010 --> 51:58.390]  There should be those umbrella things
[51:58.390 --> 51:59.910]  in every single dropdown.
[52:00.170 --> 52:02.670]  Because I think that's the Jax thing that you need, right?
[52:03.170 --> 52:04.390]  Because you haven't done that. I assume you haven't done that one.
[52:04.390 --> 52:05.750]  I think so, but I need the other one.
[52:05.750 --> 52:07.530]  Uh-huh. That's over there too.
[52:07.790 --> 52:09.750]  Let's do the one that I fucked up first
[52:09.750 --> 52:11.030]  and then we'll come back.
[52:13.090 --> 52:13.490]  Um...
[52:13.490 --> 52:15.670]  Oh yeah, I started getting symptoms
[52:15.670 --> 52:17.710]  on the day I went back. Wow, really?
[52:17.810 --> 52:19.930]  And I was saved by
[52:20.610 --> 52:21.690]  I had never seen
[52:21.690 --> 52:23.630]  Aladdin. Uh-huh. And the boat
[52:23.630 --> 52:25.670]  I was on from Seattle to Victoria
[52:25.670 --> 52:27.810]  had like the tiniest screen in front of
[52:27.810 --> 52:29.470]  me and it was displaying Aladdin.
[52:29.890 --> 52:31.650]  And I was just dying on the boat watching
[52:31.650 --> 52:32.830]  Aladdin go. Oh my god.
[52:32.830 --> 52:35.350]  How long is that boat ride?
[52:37.010 --> 52:39.250]  It's probably like 90 minutes to an hour.
[52:39.330 --> 52:41.010]  I was gonna say, that has to be
[52:41.010 --> 52:41.910]  so short, right?
[52:42.950 --> 52:43.710]  Yeah, it was miserable.
[52:45.690 --> 52:46.850]  No, it was a different year.
[52:48.210 --> 52:49.670]  I went 2008-2009
[52:49.670 --> 52:50.750]  for PAX. One year we
[52:50.750 --> 52:52.790]  won a driftball tournament that
[52:52.790 --> 52:54.830]  Rooster Teeth was hosting. Congratulations, very cool.
[52:55.270 --> 52:56.890]  Yeah, and our
[52:56.890 --> 52:58.890]  big prize was we got a
[52:58.890 --> 53:00.750]  giant, they have one in the office,
[53:00.750 --> 53:02.790]  a Halo 2 statue of
[53:02.790 --> 53:04.730]  Master Chief dual wielding.
[53:04.890 --> 53:06.250]  We got one of those.
[53:07.330 --> 53:08.690]  And I was just
[53:08.690 --> 53:10.770]  hoping, because there's four of us
[53:10.770 --> 53:12.730]  but there's only one prize, so we did
[53:12.730 --> 53:14.490]  rock, paper, scissors. And
[53:14.490 --> 53:16.730]  my cousin was part of the team, so as soon as
[53:16.730 --> 53:18.370]  I lost, I was like, I hope we fucking lose.
[53:18.490 --> 53:20.670]  Why are you doing this? Go get a ball. What are you doing?
[53:21.050 --> 53:21.970]  Go get a ball. Yeah, you're right.
[53:23.530 --> 53:24.750]  I'm mindlessly talking.
[53:25.010 --> 53:26.750]  I was an autopilot that entire
[53:26.750 --> 53:28.710]  time. I was
[53:28.710 --> 53:30.110]  watching you go, and I'm like,
[53:30.680 --> 53:31.970]  I just don't think he knows what he's doing.
[53:32.630 --> 53:34.010]  No, my brain was off.
[53:34.270 --> 53:36.710]  So who won the...
[53:36.710 --> 53:38.770]  My cousin won the
[53:38.770 --> 53:40.130]  statue, so we had to travel
[53:40.600 --> 53:42.790]  with this big-ass Master Chief statue.
[53:43.150 --> 53:44.370]  And it was a disaster.
[53:44.790 --> 53:46.530]  And they almost didn't let us enter the country
[53:46.530 --> 53:48.010]  with it because we didn't have a value
[53:48.450 --> 53:50.690]  for what it was. It was a whole thing.
[53:51.090 --> 53:51.510]  It was a nightmare.
[53:52.550 --> 53:54.670]  Leaving PAX is always difficult, is what I'm
[53:54.670 --> 53:55.830]  trying to say. That sounds right.
[53:57.670 --> 53:58.470]  I, uh...
[53:58.470 --> 53:59.830]  I think that was great. That was great.
[54:00.170 --> 54:00.350]  Yeah.
[54:01.790 --> 54:03.590]  Oh, my God. Okay, definitely haven't done that.
[54:03.650 --> 54:04.570]  Squish 30 passes.
[54:05.890 --> 54:06.770]  Oh, my God.
[54:07.590 --> 54:09.450]  Alright, good luck. You're at zero. There's one.
[54:11.330 --> 54:11.690]  I might,
[54:11.830 --> 54:13.650]  and honestly, if I just stand still...
[54:13.650 --> 54:15.490]  I don't think so. They're gonna avoid you.
[54:15.610 --> 54:15.810]  Okay.
[54:17.510 --> 54:19.530]  Well, that wasn't... You have to
[54:19.530 --> 54:21.550]  commit to a direction and not
[54:21.550 --> 54:21.950]  chase.
[54:22.910 --> 54:24.070]  I am so
[54:24.070 --> 54:26.050]  scared that this is gonna be, like,
[54:26.110 --> 54:27.550]  the Mario Party minigame. Yeah.
[54:28.390 --> 54:30.170]  Or, uh, like the bouncy balls or whatever.
[54:30.170 --> 54:31.910]  You're not committed to a direction. You're chasing.
[54:32.310 --> 54:34.010]  Look at... Folks, if you're watching this at
[54:34.010 --> 54:35.790]  home, if you're trying to get the achievement
[54:35.790 --> 54:38.050]  on this, you need to commit to a
[54:38.050 --> 54:40.050]  direction. You need to not chase
[54:40.050 --> 54:42.130]  the bugs. You need to not go after the individuals.
[54:42.130 --> 54:44.330]  I'm going against the path.
[54:44.470 --> 54:44.690]  Yeah.
[54:45.550 --> 54:48.110]  I'm gonna go back. There you go. See, there you
[54:48.110 --> 54:50.010]  go. That's... They figured it out
[54:50.010 --> 54:51.750]  Okay, if you fall off, it's fine.
[54:51.930 --> 54:53.910]  It doesn't matter. With moments to spare,
[54:54.030 --> 54:55.970]  he's got the 30, and he
[54:55.970 --> 54:57.290]  has Vanilla Bean Baby.
[54:59.130 --> 54:59.650]  Okay.
[54:59.990 --> 55:01.890]  So now we gotta get across and get that other one.
[55:02.710 --> 55:03.030]  Mm-hmm.
[55:03.550 --> 55:05.910]  I'm just gonna continue through this path,
[55:06.010 --> 55:08.110]  just to, like, make sure there's not another hidden one.
[55:08.650 --> 55:08.990]  Mm-hmm.
[55:11.950 --> 55:13.550]  Yeah, I, uh...
[55:13.550 --> 55:15.530]  One of the first things I
[55:15.530 --> 55:17.430]  did for Rooster Teeth was
[55:17.430 --> 55:19.550]  I would... They needed people to
[55:19.550 --> 55:21.570]  unlock armor for making,
[55:21.670 --> 55:23.210]  I think it was Reconstruction.
[55:23.870 --> 55:25.210]  Oh, wow. So I was...
[55:25.210 --> 55:27.550]  I had to play through and get achievements in Halo.
[55:27.710 --> 55:29.290]  Yeah, never mind. I'm fucked.
[55:29.850 --> 55:31.070]  Uh, we're not going that way.
[55:31.330 --> 55:33.750]  We're just going this way. Yep. Uh...
[55:33.750 --> 55:35.510]  I had to get achievements along with, like,
[55:35.550 --> 55:37.430]  nine other people, and I ended up having a bunch of the
[55:37.430 --> 55:39.550]  accounts. Mm-hmm. And, uh...
[55:40.230 --> 55:41.370]  I went and I bought the DVD,
[55:41.950 --> 55:43.510]  and I was so excited because
[55:43.510 --> 55:45.370]  I was like, maybe I'll get a shout-out on the DVD.
[55:45.530 --> 55:47.290]  That would be fucking crazy. Oh, that's funny. Yeah.
[55:47.630 --> 55:49.270]  Uh, and so I was watching
[55:49.270 --> 55:51.450]  it dying of swine flu. Oh, my god.
[55:51.510 --> 55:53.290]  And I watched the whole thing. Ugh.
[55:54.090 --> 55:54.410]  And...
[55:55.010 --> 55:56.810]  I'm listening to the commentary, which is great.
[55:57.270 --> 55:59.170]  And I'm like, okay, well...
[55:59.170 --> 56:01.130]  At least it'll be in the credits, so maybe they'll be like,
[56:01.190 --> 56:03.290]  oh, these people did this. And as soon as the
[56:03.290 --> 56:05.390]  credits started, they just ended their commentary
[56:05.390 --> 56:07.410]  track. Ugh! They did not go all the way
[56:07.410 --> 56:09.530]  through. Damn. And I was crushed.
[56:09.750 --> 56:11.250]  Don't jump across. I think you need
[56:11.250 --> 56:13.390]  to use the umbrella and go straight down. Yeah, I'm gonna use the umbrella
[56:13.390 --> 56:14.010]  to go down. Yep.
[56:14.010 --> 56:16.050]  Uh, yeah, that is
[56:17.390 --> 56:18.350]  absolutely crushing.
[56:18.570 --> 56:19.230]  That sucks.
[56:20.890 --> 56:21.350]  Okay.
[56:22.970 --> 56:24.030]  There we go, okay.
[56:24.190 --> 56:26.290]  That was, uh, you made me nervous,
[56:26.410 --> 56:28.390]  so that's pretty cool. Pest Control Stage 1.
[56:28.650 --> 56:30.290]  We're already experts at this.
[56:30.370 --> 56:32.310]  Yeah. No problem
[56:32.310 --> 56:32.950]  at all.
[56:34.030 --> 56:36.110]  I'm looking at, uh, the San Diego
[56:36.110 --> 56:38.130]  Padres are doing an auction. They have
[56:38.130 --> 56:40.270]  different auctions, kind of, uh, different years or whatever.
[56:40.470 --> 56:42.090]  Yeah, that's great. And, uh, they have
[56:42.090 --> 56:44.150]  different ones. They're, uh, Party Like
[56:44.150 --> 56:46.210]  an Owner at Def Leppard, Journey, and
[56:46.210 --> 56:47.630]  Steve Miller Band Concert.
[56:48.010 --> 56:49.650]  Opening bid, 500 bucks.
[56:49.890 --> 56:52.030]  And I'm like, oh, that's great. Great.
[56:52.330 --> 56:54.030]  Yep. You can get, like, a pitching
[56:54.030 --> 56:56.010]  lesson from, like, their pitching coach and all that
[56:56.010 --> 56:57.590]  stuff, but I really like... Oh, that's awesome.
[56:57.950 --> 56:59.370]  They have a, uh,
[56:59.990 --> 57:01.590]  Meet the Padres broadcast
[57:01.590 --> 57:04.090]  teams, and I think that, uh,
[57:04.270 --> 57:05.890]  they have you, like, on the air for, like, a day.
[57:06.030 --> 57:07.890]  And it's like, that's fucking, that would be awesome.
[57:08.150 --> 57:09.410]  That would be so much fun. That's really cool. Yeah.
[57:09.410 --> 57:11.490]  You fucking crushed that one, dude. That was so easy.
[57:11.590 --> 57:13.870]  Yeah, that was easy. Now that you know
[57:13.870 --> 57:14.930]  what it takes, you got it.
[57:15.930 --> 57:17.410]  Yeah. Are you gonna bid
[57:17.410 --> 57:19.310]  on any of this stuff? Are you gonna try to get anything? No, I mean,
[57:19.370 --> 57:21.250]  I like the idea of it, but, like,
[57:22.210 --> 57:23.410]  you can throw an
[57:23.410 --> 57:25.650]  honorary first pitch. 500 bucks.
[57:26.730 --> 57:27.530]  What is an
[57:27.530 --> 57:29.290]  honorary first pitch? I have
[57:29.290 --> 57:30.350]  no idea. What does that mean?
[57:31.110 --> 57:33.650]  Is that a fake first pitch? I don't know.
[57:33.710 --> 57:35.410]  Is that just, you're throwing the ball
[57:35.410 --> 57:36.930]  but we're not gonna count it? Yep.
[57:38.250 --> 57:38.970]  They don't
[57:38.970 --> 57:40.890]  give it a, they don't say it's a ball or a strike.
[57:42.870 --> 57:43.590]  That's so...
[57:44.490 --> 57:47.010]  I would be so bummed to be an opener for the
[57:47.010 --> 57:47.750]  opening pitch.
[57:49.570 --> 57:54.290]  Okay, so now where are you at next?
[57:57.570 --> 57:58.650]  Yeah, where do we gotta go next?
[57:58.750 --> 58:00.810]  TPG just texted me. What? So everything
[58:00.810 --> 58:01.850]  had to stop. Uh-oh.
[58:03.370 --> 58:04.950]  I guess he just listened to the episode
[58:04.950 --> 58:06.750]  and is telling me about his reaction
[58:06.750 --> 58:08.710]  of us talking about his hobby's topic.
[58:08.910 --> 58:09.370]  Oh, hell yeah.
[58:11.870 --> 58:12.670]  Um... okay.
[58:13.590 --> 58:14.630]  You think we go down?
[58:15.370 --> 58:16.150]  We did that.
[58:17.610 --> 58:18.790]  The fact that they don't
[58:18.790 --> 58:21.170]  show up on the mini-map is like, hey, go do this.
[58:21.250 --> 58:22.470]  Yes, I agree.
[58:23.610 --> 58:24.410]  It's really...
[58:24.770 --> 58:25.710]  It's fucking nuts.
[58:26.270 --> 58:28.430]  We also are missing 11 still.
[58:28.550 --> 58:30.710]  11 coins. Oh, yeah. And I don't know where...
[58:30.710 --> 58:32.430]  Dude, you must come back to this level later
[58:32.430 --> 58:34.450]  and go into something, because there's not
[58:34.450 --> 58:36.210]  11 coins on this level we have not gotten.
[58:37.890 --> 58:38.690]  They're nowhere.
[58:39.150 --> 58:40.030]  They are nowhere.
[58:41.110 --> 58:42.370]  But, again,
[58:42.570 --> 58:44.210]  what we need to reiterate
[58:44.210 --> 58:46.610]  is that we're doing this
[58:46.610 --> 58:48.610]  so that way you guys at home know
[58:48.610 --> 58:50.210]  like when you get stuck
[58:50.210 --> 58:52.350]  missing the 11 coins, you go, oh,
[58:52.830 --> 58:54.310]  you do have to come back later.
[58:54.650 --> 58:55.670]  Thank you, Andrew and Eric,
[58:56.150 --> 58:58.250]  for doing this for us. Thank you.
[58:58.590 --> 59:00.090]  I love watching you guys play
[59:00.090 --> 59:02.390]  the first level of this game
[59:02.390 --> 59:03.150]  a lot.
[59:03.770 --> 59:05.870]  I don't necessarily disagree with you,
[59:05.990 --> 59:08.570]  but I feel like 89 is a psychotic
[59:08.570 --> 59:09.850]  number to leave at. It's fucking crazy, isn't it?
[59:10.010 --> 59:11.830]  Yeah, it's really crazy. There's no way that they
[59:11.830 --> 59:14.030]  left it at 89. Yeah, no, it's crazy.
[59:14.410 --> 59:16.050]  Let's just go down this way.
[59:16.210 --> 59:18.150]  Okay. Yeah, climb down backwards, classic rat.
[59:18.330 --> 59:20.410]  That's good. Yeah, as they do.
[59:20.790 --> 59:22.370]  It'd be fucking ridiculous
[59:22.370 --> 59:23.690]  if they tried to do... Oh! Oh!
[59:25.510 --> 59:25.950]  Sweet.
[59:26.330 --> 59:27.790]  Okay. Uh, yeah.
[59:27.790 --> 59:29.950]  The guys, again, this was on purpose.
[59:30.110 --> 59:31.670]  This is what we wanted to do to show you
[59:31.670 --> 59:33.810]  that all it takes is a little bit of
[59:33.810 --> 59:35.950]  exploration is all you need.
[59:37.850 --> 59:38.810]  I, uh...
[59:38.810 --> 59:39.890]  Oh, god.
[59:40.170 --> 59:40.450]  Okay.
[59:42.130 --> 59:43.930]  I wonder what those things
[59:43.930 --> 59:44.990]  mean that are below
[59:45.950 --> 59:47.750]  the number for those stars.
[59:48.490 --> 59:50.050]  What do you mean? They're like silver.
[59:50.270 --> 59:51.710]  See the silver, like, coins?
[59:51.910 --> 59:52.790]  What are those?
[59:53.690 --> 59:55.170]  What are you doing?
[59:55.170 --> 59:56.490]  Get your head in the game.
[59:56.970 --> 59:57.890]  Stop looking at coins.
[59:58.390 --> 01:00:00.130]  Stop looking at coins, baby.
[01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:01.950]  I'm going left. I'm going left.
[01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.090]  There you go. You got it.
[01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:07.290]  Good. There's a lot
[01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.290]  on this one to get.
[01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:11.330]  I think this is because it's, like, stage one.
[01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:13.090]  This one's, like, simple.
[01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:14.850]  Relax. Slow down. You're going too fast.
[01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.550]  You're too far ahead.
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:18.390]  It's way too far ahead. What are you doing?
[01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:21.090]  It's really tough to recover once that happens.
[01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.050]  Where are you?
[01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:24.370]  I don't know.
[01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.950]  Go right. I'm going to have to do this again.
[01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.810]  Yes, you are.
[01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:30.390]  You are not locked in on this one, man.
[01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.250]  No, that was on me.
[01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:33.110]  Wow.
[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.550]  Yeah, that's bad. That's rough.
[01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:39.030]  See, this is what it takes
[01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.910]  to be a Ratatouille
[01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:42.930]  player. You have to
[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.250]  get your head in rat mode.
[01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:45.270]  You have to.
[01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.730]  That's it.
[01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:50.910]  I think it's so funny
[01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.690]  the player one shows up in the top left
[01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:55.130]  that it's the exact same as if you're doing this
[01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.010]  the multiplayer. How did you go so far
[01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:58.090]  ahead again? What did you do?
[01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:01.130]  I lost myself. I thought I went over that
[01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.790]  in some way.
[01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.390]  How did I not get that one?
[01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:07.050]  Andrew, come on! They're so finicky.
[01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.630]  What are you doing? You have to literally touch them.
[01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:11.070]  But I've seen you do this so many times
[01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:11.450]  now.
[01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:14.890]  And that's why I'm not going to fail
[01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:15.770]  it twice in a row.
[01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.930]  Careful, careful. Wait, wait.
[01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.450]  Patient. There you go.
[01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:22.570]  There you go. Nope. Nope.
[01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:24.130]  Right, right, right.
[01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:26.670]  We have more than enough on the left.
[01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:28.410]  Right is the way.
[01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:34.070]  Locked in.
[01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:37.350]  This is what happens when you go into rat mode.
[01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:37.950]  You get it.
[01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:39.650]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.090]  There you go. You got it.
[01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.210]  Give me another ingredient.
[01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:46.210]  Let's see what ingredient you got.
[01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:47.770]  You already did this one.
[01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:49.010]  I guess I've already done this one.
[01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.470]  Awesome game.
[01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:53.690]  Well, at least we have a way to know
[01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:55.150]  how many
[01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.130]  minigames do you... are we at five or six?
[01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:59.550]  Are we missing three?
[01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:00.050]  Yeah.
[01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:04.330]  I think there's a thing that we
[01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:05.930]  unlock. I think we come back here later.
[01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:08.310]  There's no way that we come back
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.210]  here later. You don't think so?
[01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:11.070]  There's no way.
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:14.170]  But also, if you would have asked me going into this,
[01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:16.430]  does Ratatouille have a hub world?
[01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:18.610]  I would have said, no way.
[01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.710]  But see how...
[01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.570]  Do you see the orange cones over there?
[01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:23.450]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.370]  We absolutely go that way
[01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.430]  later. Hundred percent.
[01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.310]  Let's look to see...
[01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.170]  It's so annoying that there isn't...
[01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:34.970]  pest control.
[01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.770]  Why do you show me every one of these
[01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:40.930]  that are in the game?
[01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:41.110]  Hmm.
[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.490]  Oh my god.
[01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:48.870]  Shepard Kitchen. Have not yet visited
[01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.890]  this area. See? Have not yet visited
[01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:52.050]  this area. Uh-huh.
[01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:55.190]  Not yet. Have not yet. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.150]  Yep. Yep. Yep.
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.210]  Yep. Uh-huh. Yep. Uh-huh.
[01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:00.710]  That's what I'm telling you, man.
[01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:02.870]  I'm just waiting for one that
[01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:03.670]  says you have.
[01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.110]  I think this is all of them, bud.
[01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:08.710]  Think we did everything?
[01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:09.270]  Yeah.
[01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.870]  1, 2, 3, 4. No, we have 6 of 9, though.
[01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.370]  I think we come back here later.
[01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:19.010]  City of Light's mission is completed.
[01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:20.490]  5 of 5. Minigame's completed.
[01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:21.950]  Little Chef, Big Kitchen mission.
[01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:25.010]  I think that this is... I think we're gonna come back here.
[01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:26.310]  I think we're going to come back here.
[01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.730]  I'm so nervous to leave
[01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.670]  and start something else. But, like, we're
[01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.730]  going to come back to this level.
[01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.210]  You think?
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.370]  Yes! There's just no chance we don't.
[01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.730]  The whole thing is a hub world
[01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:44.970]  and this is still open to us later.
[01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:47.330]  Like, that's the thing that makes me think
[01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:48.330]  we are coming back.
[01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:50.230]  Well, then let's go back.
[01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:53.410]  I think we gotta wrap this one up.
[01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:55.690]  Because we're up over an hour
[01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.030]  at this point. Can you believe it?
[01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.370]  Are you serious? Yes!
[01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:00.430]  Over an hour 4? Yes!
[01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:03.370]  We still have to do bonus content.
[01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:04.630]  Do the bonus...
[01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:07.050]  Did we unlock it? What is this?
[01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.010]  Oh, okay.
[01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:11.650]  Is that the animation every time?
[01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:12.870]  No, I don't think so.
[01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:15.130]  That's a different animation. This is totally different.
[01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:16.810]  This is very weird.
[01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:19.530]  Okay, so...
[01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:21.230]  We have bonus content that we can look at
[01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:23.190]  in this game and...
[01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:24.890]  Are we going to watch another episode of
[01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.290]  1-800-Flowers or whatever?
[01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:28.550]  Yeah, 1-800-Flowers.
[01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:30.670]  Use code FACE
[01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:32.590]  to get your 1-800-Flowers.
[01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:34.650]  I don't think that's probably the code
[01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:35.450]  that we'll be using.
[01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:38.330]  I don't think FACE is going to be the code.
[01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:42.650]  I think we should keep FACE as the code.
[01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:44.890]  That would be insane.
[01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:46.570]  That would be so crazy.
[01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.290]  I don't think we unlocked anything new.
[01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.310]  We don't have any new bonus images to look at? Right there!
[01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:51.710]  We haven't looked at all these!
[01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:54.690]  Oh, I guess we haven't. We haven't!
[01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.990]  Baby!
[01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:58.390]  You're spoiling them all!
[01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:00.170]  Yeah, I'm going fullscreen.
[01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:02.410]  Okay. There's Remy.
[01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:04.190]  He's at the top.
[01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:06.270]  The chef is hitting the vape.
[01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.170]  Oh, it's his hand?
[01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:08.890]  Yeah, he's vaping.
[01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:11.910]  That's what you do in the kitchen. I've seen the bear.
[01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:15.070]  Use FACE on Fume.com
[01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:16.070]  Go to Fume.
[01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.330]  It's a definite fume. He's fidgeting.
[01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:19.490]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:22.030]  He looks demented!
[01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.070]  That's fucking... Hang on.
[01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:24.610]  I want to take a picture of that.
[01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.070]  That is...
[01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.270]  That is psycho.
[01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:30.350]  That's fucking nuts.
[01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:34.790]  I want to just post that on Twitter
[01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:35.930]  and just see what people will do.
[01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:38.250]  That's so funny. Remy and Jar.
[01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:40.630]  I was just about to post that on Twitter
[01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:42.430]  to see what people would do, but you got it.
[01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:44.170]  Do you want to or do you want me to?
[01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:46.010]  No, go ahead. You're the rat guy.
[01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:47.010]  This is all you.
[01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:50.490]  Is that his goatee? Does he have a goatee?
[01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:51.330]  I guess so.
[01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.450]  I've never noticed him
[01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.570]  having a goatee.
[01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.930]  That looks fucking insane.
[01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.070]  That is psychotic.
[01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:00.810]  Remy and Jar. Pixar concept art.
[01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:01.910]  Remy and Jar.
[01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:04.190]  It looks so sad.
[01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.990]  Okay.
[01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:11.150]  Oh, this is Remy and a ghost.
[01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:11.750]  Yeah.
[01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.210]  The rat who can talk also see ghosts.
[01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.850]  Okay.
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.910]  And there's a bunch of rats running around.
[01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:19.890]  Yeah, this is what they do.
[01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:20.910]  This is where they live.
[01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:24.130]  Did we see this?
[01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:25.870]  No, you skipped that one.
[01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:28.070]  You got to save it for the next episode.
[01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.590]  Whoa, you're going to give it away for free, baby.
[01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:32.430]  Yeah, because we did five.
[01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:34.810]  I want to ride the Le Gourmet Express.
[01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.570]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.710]  Look at all these fucking dorks.
[01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:40.410]  Look at how miserable that driver is.
[01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:41.630]  He hates his job.
[01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:43.130]  He's so sick of this.
[01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:45.850]  Bonus image two.
[01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:47.790]  Yes, whatever.
[01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:49.870]  If there's not a rat in it,
[01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:51.650]  quite frankly, I'm not as interested.
[01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:55.050]  This is all ghost stuff, boo.
[01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:57.950]  Do we see this?
[01:06:58.270 --> 01:07:00.390]  I feel like there's no way we unlocked three things.
[01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:01.010]  No.
[01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:03.070]  Oh, I'm an idiot.
[01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:04.390]  I'm an idiot.
[01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.570]  I remembered what we were doing.
[01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:10.070]  I forgot that we unlocked five in one episode.
[01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:11.650]  That's on me.
[01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:13.890]  I mean, just so you know,
[01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:15.650]  Oh, wow, look at this one.
[01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:16.790]  I like this.
[01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:19.090]  That's me.
[01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:20.890]  That's me watching you play this game.
[01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:32.490]  Why is he leaving to go fight the cat?
[01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:34.470]  That's not where we're supposed to go.
[01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:35.410]  Oh, man.
[01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:37.250]  I don't want to be presumptuous,
[01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.710]  but woman under 96 is giving off
[01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:41.310]  a very specific vibe.
[01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:44.150]  Hey, welcome to Paris, Andrew.
[01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:45.350]  This is the way it is, dude.
[01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:47.730]  Three.
[01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.590]  Oh, this is where he hangs out with a ghost.
[01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:52.190]  Yeah, look at how small he is right there.
[01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:54.950]  That gives you a sense of scale of the rat.
[01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:58.110]  Four.
[01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:00.310]  There they are.
[01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:03.290]  Blue people everywhere. Zero rats. Blue people.
[01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:05.490]  Well, that's all the ratatouille here.
[01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.370]  Stop looking, because now we burned through
[01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.730]  all of our content.
[01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:12.010]  It just gave us pressure to get bonus content
[01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:13.070]  in the next episode.
[01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.890]  Well, we have to go to a new level to do that,
[01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:15.830]  so I guess that's good.
[01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:20.070]  But now, it's time to watch 1-800-MAGIC,
[01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.970]  a video that when we told Geoff
[01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.290]  that we were doing that,
[01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:25.530]  he just laughed and went,
[01:08:25.650 --> 01:08:25.810]  what?
[01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.630]  Look at my new theme.
[01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:31.390]  Look at that. I'm a real fan.
[01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:33.350]  Drive-thru open.
[01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:35.670]  Hey, Red vs. Blue.
[01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:37.990]  Drive-thru open. 24 hours, right?
[01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.970]  Classic.
[01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:42.530]  Classic Red vs. Blue stuff right there, baby.
[01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:43.850]  Wacky.
[01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:46.050]  Speech-to-smack-talk conversion.
[01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:47.410]  Yeah, baby.
[01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:50.450]  Enable enhanced Tuckerisms.
[01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:51.270]  Mature.
[01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:54.430]  Use text voice filter to disguise.
[01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:56.270]  What does that say?
[01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:57.810]  It's crazy, because this wasn't
[01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:59.290]  so long ago on the internet,
[01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:01.310]  but boy, it feels like a lifetime, doesn't it?
[01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:03.570]  Yes, it feels
[01:09:03.570 --> 01:09:05.610]  the same way I get
[01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:07.270]  the feeling I get when I watch a Turner
[01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:09.630]  classic movie is the same way I
[01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:11.570]  feel about seeing this.
[01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.550]  Okay, so we
[01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.570]  gotta go to movies and TV,
[01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.570]  which I wouldn't categorize
[01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:19.150]  1800 Magic as either.
[01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:21.350]  No, I think you're right.
[01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:23.650]  I've also added
[01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:25.330]  some stuff since we last did this.
[01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:25.830]  Is that right?
[01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:29.270]  You're always working in the background,
[01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:31.010]  like a little rat trying to cook.
[01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:32.770]  I am.
[01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:36.490]  Please
[01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:36.950]  load
[01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:37.930]  all of my files.
[01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:40.590]  It makes sense, I downloaded a lot.
[01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:41.110]  There we go.
[01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:43.750]  My videos.
[01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:46.750]  My
[01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:47.810]  game videos.
[01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:50.250]  I'm so excited for us to watch episode 7.
[01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:52.090]  It's a definite game video.
[01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:54.330]  Oh my god.
[01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:56.510]  Why do you have
[01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:58.550]  7 episodes of The Guild, dude?
[01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:00.170]  As in one of the guilds?
[01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.230]  Yeah, I think maybe you can
[01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.790]  delete that too. Holy
[01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:06.330]  shit. We gotta
[01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:08.250]  watch Control Delete sometime,
[01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:10.530]  bud. That's
[01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.990]  my...
[01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:13.850]  Talk about my wheelhouse.
[01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.570]  This is just... that rocks.
[01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.330]  Oh, this is so fucking cool.
[01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:19.710]  I'm so excited.
[01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.070]  Bee Movie. I like
[01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:24.370]  it's E3 2007, but it's just Bee Movie.
[01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.070]  Dude, what the fuck?
[01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:28.190]  You have to dig so deep for
[01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.050]  1-800-Flowers or what? 1-800-Magic.
[01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.970]  Here we go, okay.
[01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:32.610]  Episode 2.
[01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.370]  Alright, here we go. Guys, this is 1-800-Magic
[01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:37.290]  Episode 2.
[01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:39.130]  Meow meow.
[01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.870]  Meow meow.
[01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:45.090]  This rocks.
[01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:47.810]  How long is this?
[01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:50.230]  I don't know. I'm looking it up
[01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:50.770]  right now.
[01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:56.990]  The skybox is very
[01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.350]  halo.
[01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:58.030]  Hahaha.
[01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:02.910]  Me?
[01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.610]  Oh my god.
[01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:09.410]  This is only
[01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:10.470]  4 and a half minutes long.
[01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:11.830]  Great, okay.
[01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:18.690]  Oh my god.
[01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:23.310]  I don't know who
[01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.970]  the tree is.
[01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:26.050]  No, I don't
[01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:26.310]  either.
[01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.270]  You make a good point.
[01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:31.270]  How can that be?
[01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:33.790]  A company
[01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:34.750]  paid for this.
[01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:37.330]  But, here's the thing.
[01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:39.990]  Like, watching this
[01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:41.890]  now, it feels
[01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.990]  derivative because everyone did this
[01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:45.210]  and it's so out of buff.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.970]  At the time, this was
[01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.910]  like, holy shit, dude.
[01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.330]  We could put this on TV.
[01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:51.830]  Like,
[01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:54.550]  this is what G4
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.610]  wanted to be, right?
[01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.350]  It was just this stuff.
[01:11:58.990 --> 01:12:01.070]  It was so,
[01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:03.050]  so fucking, like,
[01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:04.650]  of the time to do this.
[01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:05.390]  This is great.
[01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.410]  I bet you there's so much
[01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.210]  bad machinima still on YouTube.
[01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:12.290]  Oh god, yeah.
[01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:14.990]  I bet there's new
[01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:17.330]  bad machinima being made
[01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:18.010]  every day.
[01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:19.310]  Really?
[01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:21.810]  Oh, I think people are still doing this.
[01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:24.150]  I can't
[01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.110]  imagine. Oh, I think so.
[01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:28.310]  What is the biggest machinima right now?
[01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:28.750]  I wonder.
[01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:30.410]  I'm gonna look it up.
[01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:34.010]  Is there anything that gets more than 10,000 views
[01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:35.350]  per episode still?
[01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:37.250]  Do you smell bacon?
[01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:39.470]  Why does it smell like bacon?
[01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:41.870]  Okay, let's not panic.
[01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:43.950]  I brought a cyanide pill
[01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:44.650]  for each of us.
[01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:45.150]  What?
[01:12:46.330 --> 01:12:48.550]  It's funny knowing that
[01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:50.490]  they spent probably 10 hours
[01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:51.510]  doing this once.
[01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:56.450]  And then, like, discussions about
[01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:58.490]  the light flickering on the face.
[01:12:58.690 --> 01:12:59.910]  I imagine there's
[01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:02.950]  making sure the bullets don't actually enter the frame.
[01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.590]  All these zooms.
[01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:18.750]  This is the time when bacon was really
[01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:19.590]  funny on the internet.
[01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:21.590]  100%!
[01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:24.750]  That was very relevant at that time.
[01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.790]  I found, Andrew, I just searched the word
[01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:34.170]  machinima, and I found
[01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:36.790]  a video that somebody uploaded yesterday
[01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:38.770]  that has 90 views
[01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:40.110]  and it is
[01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.950]  a machinima.
[01:13:42.230 --> 01:13:45.030]  What I'm saying is that I think it is still a thing
[01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:46.970]  that people are doing.
[01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:48.110]  I found one here.
[01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:51.230]  180,000 views from 10 months ago.
[01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:52.930]  Really?
[01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.890]  Yeah.
[01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:55.550]  180,000?
[01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.910]  That's crazy.
[01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:59.870]  I think it's a thing that people still do.
[01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:01.050]  I'm not going to say it on this.
[01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:04.130]  What game is it? Halo.
[01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:07.350]  They're still doing Halo stuff?
[01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:08.450]  People are, yeah.
[01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.750]  I think it's out there, man.
[01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:13.310]  I think you're just looking at a Red vs. Blue thing.
[01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:15.070]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
[01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.710]  Oh my god, who died?
[01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.230]  Oh my god, this is...
[01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:27.410]  It's a long four and a half minutes.
[01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:29.650]  It is a long four and a half minutes.
[01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:34.750]  You still got Geoff, though.
[01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:35.630]  He's killing it.
[01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:38.590]  You did it!
[01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:41.430]  I really think
[01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:43.110]  that the fandom Strangerhood got
[01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.710]  should have went to 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:45.550]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.130]  But he just said he couldn't be stopped.
[01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:54.850]  There's that bacon smell again.
[01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:56.710]  Okay, now I'm getting hungry.
[01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:57.430]  Oh, that's burning.
[01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:03.190]  Oh, we gotta buy 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:06.250]  Did we check that?
[01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:07.870]  That was one of the URLs, right?
[01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:09.310]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.570]  Yeah.
[01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:11.350]  It doesn't go anywhere.
[01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:13.970]  Well, that was 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:16.130]  That was Ratatouille.
[01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:17.830]  Episode 3.
[01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:22.070]  I'm excited to see where Ratatouille goes.
[01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:23.130]  I'm excited to see...
[01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:24.490]  What the f... We're not watching this.
[01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:27.190]  I'm excited to see what other videos
[01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:29.310]  Andrew is going to...
[01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:31.650]  We're not gonna watch this!
[01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:33.510]  We have to go! We have to end this video!
[01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:34.710]  Hell yeah, queen!
[01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.990]  Celebs!
[01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.910]  This is fucking crazy.
[01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:39.850]  Hang on, let me see about Console King.
[01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:41.390]  Is Console King still going?
[01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:45.650]  I hope. I hope they're making Machinima.
[01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:48.010]  Console King's still alive.
[01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:49.350]  Hell yeah!
[01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:51.910]  Well, I mean, there's a website you can go to
[01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:53.910]  and it says, coming soon, stickers, t-shirts,
[01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.170]  masks, etc.
[01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:57.090]  So I don't know. Sweet.
[01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:59.250]  Yeah, we need to stop here.
[01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:02.270]  1-800-MAGIC doesn't allow me to do that.
[01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:03.990]  This is a Console King exclusive.
[01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.790]  That's fucking funny.
[01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:06.350]  Wow.
[01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:09.870]  We're gonna finish that level
[01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:11.050]  next time we do this.
[01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.570]  That level's already done, we have to move on to a new level.
[01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:14.690]  We have a new level.
[01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:16.970]  Guys, in the next one, it's a new level.
[01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:19.230]  In the next one, it's a new level.
[01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:21.850]  I'm not gonna spoil anything for myself,
[01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:23.610]  but I will do some research to make sure that
[01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:24.290]  that is accurate.
[01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:26.910]  We'll circle back.
[01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:28.430]  Hell of a recording.
[01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:31.470]  I feel like we learned a lot
[01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:32.350]  about the rats.
[01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:34.730]  I agree. We saw through rat vision,
[01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:36.750]  we saw POV rat style,
[01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:38.690]  we got in rat mode.
[01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:40.250]  We got some achievements.
[01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:42.270]  I feel good about it.
[01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:43.010]  We're almost there.
[01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.250]  Another one of these.
[01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:47.850]  That made us...
[01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:50.310]  When you opened it and it said 9 of 50,
[01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:51.750]  my fucking heart sank.
[01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.930]  Wait, wait, wait. Hang on.
[01:16:57.710 --> 01:16:58.790]  What's the first achievement?
[01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:00.910]  That one right there?
[01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:01.770]  Rolling Hills.
[01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:03.830]  Look at the date.
[01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:08.050]  Oh yeah, I played this.
[01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:10.770]  I bounced off of Ratatouille.
[01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:13.250]  I got it for easy achievements
[01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:14.730]  and I bounced off of it
[01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.010]  after that.
[01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:18.010]  Let's see the next one.
[01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:20.750]  Okay, so we did the Stump.
[01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:25.550]  Wait, I played the City of Lights?
[01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:26.070]  Keep going.
[01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:27.870]  There we go.
[01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:31.610]  I can't believe I...
[01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.070]  I guess I played that grandma sequence before
[01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:35.510]  and I somehow just forgot.
[01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:38.350]  Honestly, I wouldn't remember anything from 2007 either.
[01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:40.030]  So it's fine. It's cool.
[01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:41.510]  Guys, go listen to the podcast.
[01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:42.510]  Listen to the Regulation Podcast.
[01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:46.410]  This has been a regulation achievement hunt.
[01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:48.310]  I don't know if we can call it that technically.
[01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:50.230]  But we are showing you
[01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:51.810]  how to 100% Ratatouille.
[01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:53.930]  And go subscribe to the Patreon also.
[01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:55.610]  Thank you very much
[01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:57.170]  and we'll see you next time. Bye!
