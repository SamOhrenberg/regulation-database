[00:00.000 --> 00:03.340]  Hello! It's Worms, but old.
[00:03.720 --> 00:04.300]  Ow!
[00:06.340 --> 00:06.940]  Blindside!
[00:08.240 --> 00:08.740]  What?
[00:09.180 --> 00:11.240]  We got a blindside! Woo!
[00:11.660 --> 00:13.560]  You already, didn't you already use your blindside?
[00:13.680 --> 00:15.340]  Nope! It's a new year!
[00:15.440 --> 00:16.580]  New blindside!
[00:17.220 --> 00:18.760]  Did Andrew not use his blindside this year?
[00:18.820 --> 00:20.460]  Are you fucking positive?
[00:21.460 --> 00:22.180]  Are you serious right now?
[00:22.640 --> 00:25.020]  It's a blindside and it is a
[00:25.020 --> 00:26.940]  special blindside, cause
[00:26.940 --> 00:29.020]  this is coming out
[00:29.020 --> 00:30.380]  on Eric's birthday.
[00:31.220 --> 00:33.060]  It's Eric's birthday
[00:33.880 --> 00:34.560]  extravaganza.
[00:34.740 --> 00:37.380]  Let me go to my screen.
[00:37.780 --> 00:38.780]  Eric, I've built you
[00:38.780 --> 00:41.600]  a thing. We are not playing Worms.
[00:41.600 --> 00:43.180]  It is a blindside.
[00:43.820 --> 00:45.360]  Why did I pay for Worms?
[00:45.420 --> 00:47.260]  Cause we're gonna play Worms on a
[00:47.260 --> 00:48.980]  different day, but today
[00:48.980 --> 00:51.040]  get ready to record a
[00:51.040 --> 00:53.080]  screen. It is the birthday
[00:53.080 --> 00:54.820]  extravaganza wheel.
[00:55.200 --> 00:57.260]  We have a wheel of games
[00:57.260 --> 00:59.360]  for Eric to potentially play
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.500]  well, for me to play.
[01:00.640 --> 01:02.140]  For Eric's birthday.
[01:02.800 --> 01:05.080]  No! Stop recording.
[01:05.540 --> 01:07.180]  God damn it. We got a whole
[01:07.180 --> 01:08.660]  wheel of possibilities.
[01:09.300 --> 01:10.260]  What will it be?
[01:10.500 --> 01:12.460]  On Eric's birthday surprise.
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.960]  Please get an ad blocker.
[01:15.700 --> 01:16.220]  Never!
[01:20.360 --> 01:21.580]  Don't... Coast Capital
[01:21.580 --> 01:23.260]  Savings. What is that?
[01:23.340 --> 01:23.840]  Oh, here we go.
[01:23.840 --> 01:25.980]  Can't go wrong with Coast Capital Savings.
[01:26.080 --> 01:27.800]  Hey, Nick, meet the powerful tools
[01:27.800 --> 01:29.280]  everyone needs to thrive at work.
[01:29.780 --> 01:30.480]  Yeah, I can read it.
[01:30.820 --> 01:33.860]  Can you shuffle this
[01:33.860 --> 01:36.000]  a bunch of times? Cause I don't think you've shuffled it.
[01:36.440 --> 01:37.880]  I sure haven't. Let's
[01:37.880 --> 01:38.380]  shuffle.
[01:39.880 --> 01:41.540]  Nick, are you recording the screen?
[01:43.260 --> 01:45.440]  Let's spin the wheel to see what we get.
[01:45.680 --> 01:47.540]  On Eric's birthday extravaganza.
[01:47.720 --> 01:48.800]  I don't wanna play Ratty Boy.
[01:49.180 --> 01:49.920]  A blindside?
[01:49.920 --> 01:52.580]  I don't wanna play Ratty Boy.
[01:52.580 --> 01:53.540]  Land on the wheel.
[01:53.900 --> 01:54.800]  Go to the second wheel.
[01:55.320 --> 01:57.840]  Oh no, it's Ratty Boy.
[01:58.100 --> 01:59.980]  Who could have seen this coming?
[02:01.700 --> 02:02.840]  We already did Ratty Boy.
[02:02.840 --> 02:03.660]  Classic Ratty Boy
[02:03.660 --> 02:04.680]  adventures.
[02:05.180 --> 02:06.740]  This game gives me a headache.
[02:07.320 --> 02:09.140]  This is why he wanted to do this first.
[02:09.520 --> 02:12.100]  Share my screen. That's right, Nick.
[02:12.160 --> 02:13.500]  That's exactly why.
[02:14.780 --> 02:16.220]  I wanted to do this first.
[02:16.420 --> 02:17.580]  Happy birthday, Eric.
[02:17.580 --> 02:18.840]  Stop streaming this.
[02:19.560 --> 02:21.000]  Happy RT closing day.
[02:21.500 --> 02:23.360]  I turned off my Xbox.
[02:24.480 --> 02:25.940]  Last year you lost your job
[02:25.940 --> 02:27.680]  and this year you're rewarded with
[02:27.680 --> 02:29.360]  Ratty Boy. Now I've lost my dignity.
[02:29.660 --> 02:31.860]  We are back with Ratty Boy adventures.
[02:32.360 --> 02:32.500]  No!
[02:32.540 --> 02:35.000]  This blindside cost us $125.
[02:37.660 --> 02:38.860]  We just...
[02:38.860 --> 02:40.980]  I thought you...
[02:42.380 --> 02:43.640]  Did you not use your
[02:43.640 --> 02:44.640]  blindside this year?
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.840]  No, I used it on the
[02:47.400 --> 02:48.360]  monkey guy.
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.620]  Now we've done this
[02:50.620 --> 02:51.200]  before.
[02:52.580 --> 02:54.580]  I sure am. I'm rolling
[02:54.580 --> 02:56.740]  video. I'm rolling audio. I got it all.
[02:56.840 --> 02:57.360]  We're doing a new game.
[02:58.160 --> 03:00.140]  We've done this in the past.
[03:00.720 --> 03:02.420]  I went to
[03:02.420 --> 03:04.120]  get ready to have this edited.
[03:04.280 --> 03:05.200]  The one we did in the past.
[03:05.780 --> 03:07.440]  It does not exist.
[03:08.120 --> 03:09.840]  We are doing this again
[03:09.840 --> 03:12.140]  because of that double blindsiding.
[03:12.140 --> 03:12.800]  No!
[03:14.700 --> 03:15.460]  It didn't work?
[03:16.360 --> 03:18.140]  So the previous blindside
[03:18.140 --> 03:20.560]  didn't take? No, it sure didn't.
[03:20.600 --> 03:22.100]  Nick didn't have any audio
[03:22.100 --> 03:24.320]  uploaded for himself and the video for it
[03:24.320 --> 03:25.420]  was corrupted.
[03:26.260 --> 03:27.140]  Who recorded the video?
[03:28.080 --> 03:29.880]  I recorded the video.
[03:31.280 --> 03:32.140]  That's a strike.
[03:33.020 --> 03:34.640]  Oh, that's a strike for Andrew.
[03:34.920 --> 03:36.320]  I like that. No, I submitted it.
[03:36.520 --> 03:37.800]  It just didn't work.
[03:38.720 --> 03:40.180]  So you have the uploaded file.
[03:40.180 --> 03:42.380]  It is broken? Yeah, it just is
[03:42.380 --> 03:43.880]  fucked. I'm going to look for it.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.420]  Sounds like Nick has a strike.
[03:46.200 --> 03:48.140]  Yeah, but Nick didn't upload his audio
[03:48.140 --> 03:48.960]  and there was no Craig.
[03:49.740 --> 03:51.980]  No matter what, he just wasn't there.
[03:53.160 --> 03:54.420]  It could be a Nick strike.
[03:54.700 --> 03:56.060]  I bet I could find it.
[03:56.340 --> 03:57.460]  Why didn't you look for it?
[03:58.220 --> 03:59.500]  Yeah, why didn't you find it, Nick?
[04:00.420 --> 04:00.900]  Alright, Gavin.
[04:00.900 --> 04:02.040]  Okay, alright, hold on.
[04:02.320 --> 04:04.460]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[04:06.280 --> 04:07.440]  Nom nom nom nom.
[04:07.920 --> 04:08.320]  Scotch.
[04:09.580 --> 04:09.980]  Andrew
[04:11.260 --> 04:11.660]  Geoff.
[04:13.320 --> 04:13.420]  What?
[04:14.580 --> 04:16.820]  If you find it, that means we don't have to
[04:16.820 --> 04:18.180]  do this, so please find it.
[04:19.200 --> 04:20.780]  So I was in the last
[04:20.780 --> 04:22.020]  Blindside 2, huh?
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.620]  You were, you saw all of it, so it was your introduction
[04:24.620 --> 04:26.620]  to this game. What do you think of his
[04:26.620 --> 04:28.000]  three little hairs, Geoff?
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.700]  I think they're annoying.
[04:29.800 --> 04:31.880]  I mean, adorable. I hate this
[04:31.880 --> 04:32.840]  fucking guy.
[04:33.880 --> 04:36.000]  Well, it's too bad you hate him because he's ours.
[04:36.100 --> 04:38.080]  There's been a lot of talk about did we lose Ratty
[04:38.080 --> 04:39.620]  boy when we became
[04:39.620 --> 04:41.980]  independent? We didn't. He's still ours.
[04:42.080 --> 04:43.440]  He's been waiting in the weeds.
[04:44.120 --> 04:45.940]  Did we lose him and get him back or we
[04:45.940 --> 04:48.000]  never lost him? We never lost him.
[04:48.460 --> 04:50.100]  Oh. He's been ours the whole
[04:50.100 --> 04:51.560]  time. It's more
[04:51.560 --> 04:53.080]  a case of we never had him.
[04:53.780 --> 04:55.880]  We always had it, but we never
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.000]  lost it. We're not Applejack.
[04:58.160 --> 04:59.840]  How can one company own something
[04:59.840 --> 05:01.820]  so vile is I think the big
[05:01.820 --> 05:02.180]  question.
[05:03.520 --> 05:05.720]  Is vile French for adorable and
[05:05.720 --> 05:07.880]  likable? I hate hate. It must
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.780]  be. I fucking hate his little rip-off
[05:09.780 --> 05:11.140]  Bart Simpson ass, dude.
[05:11.220 --> 05:13.580]  We made another
[05:13.580 --> 05:16.020]  Ratty boy t-shirt to celebrate
[05:16.020 --> 05:17.820]  marriage. We did, and it's coming
[05:17.820 --> 05:19.820]  out on Eric's birthday. It's part of his birthday
[05:19.820 --> 05:20.620]  extravaganza.
[05:21.800 --> 05:22.960]  I hate that it's...
[05:22.960 --> 05:24.980]  What else is happening on the extravaganza?
[05:26.320 --> 05:27.240]  It's his birthday!
[05:27.900 --> 05:28.600]  I think that's it.
[05:28.780 --> 05:30.800]  I found it!
[05:31.240 --> 05:31.920]  Did you really?
[05:33.100 --> 05:34.620]  That's good. Hold on.
[05:35.900 --> 05:37.120]  Maybe we can release the
[05:37.120 --> 05:39.160]  audio version of that
[05:39.160 --> 05:41.080]  blindside. Oh my
[05:41.080 --> 05:42.980]  God, did I roll video
[05:42.980 --> 05:44.260]  on it? Please.
[05:44.520 --> 05:46.740]  Did you? Hold on.
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.420]  I'm looking. Please.
[05:48.640 --> 05:50.940]  If you have video of it, then this doesn't
[05:50.940 --> 05:52.640]  need to happen at all.
[05:52.960 --> 05:54.820]  Kind of like it does now.
[05:54.960 --> 05:57.140]  No! Okay, I guess
[05:57.140 --> 05:58.460]  we're doing it as part of
[05:58.460 --> 06:00.760]  Eric's birthday extravaganza!
[06:01.580 --> 06:02.860]  We can't give out
[06:02.860 --> 06:04.980]  bonus Ratty boy. I hate
[06:04.980 --> 06:06.920]  him. We need to only
[06:06.920 --> 06:08.100]  give out bonus Ratty boy.
[06:09.140 --> 06:10.880]  I love the fact that we
[06:10.880 --> 06:12.800]  have a Ratty boy in the can
[06:12.800 --> 06:14.960]  that now we can release whenever. Oh, Andrew,
[06:15.060 --> 06:16.540]  this is your fucked up video. Never mind.
[06:16.540 --> 06:17.080]  Oh.
[06:18.440 --> 06:19.860]  So it is gone.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.700]  Should we release just the audio version
[06:22.700 --> 06:24.480]  of the other Ratty boy
[06:24.480 --> 06:26.540]  also? I think we should release
[06:26.540 --> 06:28.600]  old audio and have Andrew
[06:28.600 --> 06:29.960]  re-film it alone.
[06:30.140 --> 06:32.060]  I think that's a great idea.
[06:32.320 --> 06:34.440]  Where did everything
[06:34.440 --> 06:36.880]  go? This is a classic Ratty boy glitch.
[06:37.720 --> 06:40.560]  He goes through the ceiling and everything's
[06:40.560 --> 06:42.580]  gone. Uploading now.
[06:47.100 --> 06:48.560]  How many levels
[06:48.560 --> 06:50.240]  is Ratty boy? So many.
[06:50.620 --> 06:51.980]  Once I beat this one, we'll see.
[06:52.220 --> 06:54.620]  It's so many. It's so many levels.
[06:54.800 --> 06:56.500]  And have you done every level already?
[06:56.560 --> 06:58.660]  We sure did. In the last blindside we recorded
[06:58.660 --> 07:00.540]  we went through all of them.
[07:01.260 --> 07:02.440]  What? Did we?
[07:02.820 --> 07:04.460]  Yes. We did all of them. It took a little
[07:04.460 --> 07:06.520]  over an hour. Oh, that
[07:06.520 --> 07:08.540]  was the one where I had to get Advil. I'm gonna go
[07:08.540 --> 07:09.580]  and get some again. Yes.
[07:10.220 --> 07:12.620]  Ratty boy gives you headaches. Ratty boy makes you sick.
[07:12.840 --> 07:14.400]  Gavin's not gonna be able to do the podcast now.
[07:14.400 --> 07:15.840]  No! And remember
[07:16.370 --> 07:18.180]  I told you guys we should do the podcast
[07:18.180 --> 07:20.440]  first. Well, blindsiding before a
[07:20.440 --> 07:21.740]  podcast is ridiculous.
[07:22.920 --> 07:24.560]  But we need this now.
[07:25.280 --> 07:26.240]  We need it now.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.740]  And I thought this might come up.
[07:32.320 --> 07:36.400]  I can't believe that video broke, Andrew.
[07:37.360 --> 07:38.380]  You think this one will be okay?
[07:39.380 --> 07:40.500]  It better be.
[07:41.120 --> 07:42.200]  I started rolling again.
[07:44.520 --> 07:46.080]  Classic ratty boy glitch, Gavin.
[07:47.060 --> 07:48.600]  Now, is he just stuck like that
[07:48.600 --> 07:48.920]  forever?
[07:50.500 --> 07:52.460]  I really like the collision sounds.
[07:52.640 --> 07:53.260]  I don't.
[07:57.440 --> 07:57.920]  Man.
[07:59.840 --> 08:02.100]  Eric, what's for lunch on your birthday, man?
[08:02.540 --> 08:04.300]  What's what? What's for lunch
[08:04.300 --> 08:06.300]  on your birthday? I don't know.
[08:06.760 --> 08:08.240]  Like today or his actual birthday?
[08:09.080 --> 08:10.440]  Like, maybe I'll go get a
[08:10.440 --> 08:12.320]  hamburger or something? I'm not really sure.
[08:12.320 --> 08:13.940]  I'm not much of a birthday guy.
[08:14.200 --> 08:15.500]  What's for lunch today?
[08:18.100 --> 08:19.160]  I don't know.
[08:20.400 --> 08:21.780]  You're not much of a lunch guy, huh?
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.360]  Am I picking something for everyone to eat
[08:24.360 --> 08:26.420]  today? I'm just interested in what you're
[08:26.420 --> 08:28.160]  eating. I just realized I'm hungry and I thought,
[08:28.260 --> 08:30.340]  oh, today's all about Eric. Let's see what Eric's
[08:30.340 --> 08:32.380]  got going on culinarily and then maybe I'll
[08:32.380 --> 08:34.240]  piggyback off that. I don't know. Oh, I don't think he will.
[08:34.340 --> 08:36.400]  I think it'll probably be
[08:36.400 --> 08:38.300]  like some veggies
[08:38.300 --> 08:40.520]  with parmesan and some chicken breast.
[08:40.520 --> 08:42.220]  I know, that's what I'm just noticing.
[08:42.400 --> 08:43.540]  He gets like turkey shoulders.
[08:43.960 --> 08:45.400]  Is he different when he walks?
[08:46.080 --> 08:47.740]  Oh, he's definitely different.
[08:48.940 --> 08:50.240]  Oh, he's definitely different.
[08:51.100 --> 08:52.500]  He's like shrug running.
[08:52.920 --> 08:53.040]  Yeah.
[08:55.360 --> 08:56.280]  This is how Eric
[08:56.280 --> 08:57.900]  walks on his birthday. It's his birthday shuffle.
[08:59.880 --> 09:01.700]  This is him going to get his chicken parm.
[09:03.220 --> 09:04.320]  Oh, chicken parms.
[09:04.400 --> 09:04.780]  That's good.
[09:06.560 --> 09:08.520]  Fucking cheese. Where do you get a chicken
[09:08.520 --> 09:09.640]  parm in Austin though?
[09:11.320 --> 09:12.680]  Any Italian restaurant.
[09:13.120 --> 09:14.340]  Right, that's right.
[09:14.440 --> 09:15.260]  That's the question.
[09:16.020 --> 09:18.080]  Mandola's is alright. Mandola's is good.
[09:18.400 --> 09:20.360]  There we go, we can leave. Getting out of here.
[09:22.220 --> 09:23.460]  It's also quick, Eric.
[09:24.240 --> 09:26.080]  Escape! It is quick.
[09:26.980 --> 09:28.700]  How far can a rat fall?
[09:30.180 --> 09:32.420]  Let's test it. Or is it small enough
[09:32.420 --> 09:33.760]  that it doesn't get hurt?
[09:34.900 --> 09:36.580]  6, 7, 8, 9,
[09:36.580 --> 09:38.100]  10, 11, 12,
[09:38.400 --> 09:40.360]  13, 14. Speaking of stuff
[09:40.360 --> 09:42.600]  falling, did you guys see that dude fall
[09:42.600 --> 09:43.660]  out of the stands yesterday?
[09:46.400 --> 09:47.940]  Drunk guy fell off the...
[09:47.940 --> 09:50.360]  21 feet. Did he live?
[09:50.980 --> 09:52.640]  Yeah. He was alive
[09:52.640 --> 09:54.700]  when they took him out, but they have not
[09:54.700 --> 09:56.080]  given an update yet.
[09:56.600 --> 09:57.620]  It didn't look good though.
[09:58.060 --> 10:00.520]  Eric, since it's your birthday extravaganza, you should
[10:00.520 --> 10:02.100]  pick the level that we go to next.
[10:02.800 --> 10:04.840]  Banyo, because it's
[10:04.840 --> 10:06.200]  Banyo, but it's spelled a Y.
[10:06.680 --> 10:08.840]  I think it's like...
[10:10.760 --> 10:12.420]  Is it like Filipino?
[10:12.780 --> 10:13.200]  Let me see.
[10:14.640 --> 10:16.300]  Why is there a fire in the book?
[10:17.400 --> 10:18.740]  That's a great question. I was gonna
[10:18.740 --> 10:20.920]  bring up the washing machine.
[10:21.660 --> 10:22.780]  Also, I feel like it's kind of
[10:22.780 --> 10:24.200]  an unusual bathroom feature.
[10:25.120 --> 10:26.240]  Did anyone ever, like,
[10:26.580 --> 10:29.060]  that you know, used to light a match
[10:29.060 --> 10:31.140]  when they took a really nasty shit?
[10:33.080 --> 10:34.280]  What was the cup's name?
[10:34.380 --> 10:36.180]  So it smells like matches?
[10:36.400 --> 10:38.400]  I do. Yeah, I mean, I've seen it in movies.
[10:38.800 --> 10:40.180]  So it smells like
[10:40.180 --> 10:41.680]  fire and ass? Yeah.
[10:42.180 --> 10:44.380]  It doesn't smell like ass anymore, it just smells like
[10:44.380 --> 10:46.200]  fire. It smells a bit like ass though.
[10:47.300 --> 10:48.240]  Maybe the way you're doing it.
[10:48.500 --> 10:49.740]  A song of fire and ass?
[10:51.300 --> 10:52.240]  You didn't get the
[10:52.240 --> 10:54.100]  star on top of the paper towels, by the way.
[10:54.160 --> 10:56.180]  Was that intentional? Yeah, you know,
[10:56.220 --> 10:57.180]  I'm not a big star guy.
[10:58.380 --> 11:00.120]  Rowdy boy. I don't think that's
[11:00.120 --> 11:02.060]  true at all. I agree
[11:02.060 --> 11:03.960]  with that, I don't think that's true at all. Did you see Mario Party
[11:03.960 --> 11:06.100]  March? I'm not a star guy. By the way, there's
[11:06.100 --> 11:08.080]  a thing down there, you should get that. Yeah, I'm trying to figure out
[11:08.080 --> 11:08.960]  how to swim down.
[11:10.120 --> 11:11.900]  I don't remember you swimming before.
[11:12.180 --> 11:12.660]  I don't either.
[11:14.220 --> 11:16.460]  Oh, is it a thing where I just, I have to...
[11:16.460 --> 11:18.120]  Maybe you have to jump from high.
[11:18.300 --> 11:19.720]  Yeah, maybe it's like beans related.
[11:20.680 --> 11:22.140]  Yeah, nope, that duck is
[11:22.140 --> 11:24.040]  not real. That's a fake duck.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.200]  It's a figment of your imagination.
[11:27.020 --> 11:28.080]  I don't think any of this
[11:28.080 --> 11:28.540]  is real.
[11:30.800 --> 11:32.000]  Gavin's having an existential
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.800]  crisis. Okay.
[11:34.260 --> 11:34.840]  There you go.
[11:35.880 --> 11:36.900]  You missed it.
[11:37.440 --> 11:39.940]  I sure did. I hate how
[11:39.940 --> 11:42.060]  many times my life has looked
[11:42.060 --> 11:43.980]  like this. Me too.
[11:44.400 --> 11:46.100]  I'm just stood here watching this frickin
[11:46.100 --> 11:47.620]  thing. I got it!
[11:47.780 --> 11:49.300]  I was the star!
[11:49.960 --> 11:51.980]  Shit! Yeah, but you're a star guy, so
[11:51.980 --> 11:52.380]  it's fine.
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.740]  We all agree you're a star guy now.
[11:55.740 --> 11:57.580]  Yep. I went to school with a guy named Star.
[11:58.400 --> 11:58.760]  Really?
[11:59.420 --> 12:01.160]  I did, yeah. Freddie Star?
[12:01.340 --> 12:03.300]  I haven't talked to him in like 30 years.
[12:03.680 --> 12:05.520]  I'm 30, that'd be weird. You should check in on
[12:05.520 --> 12:07.000]  Freddie Star and see what he's up to.
[12:07.300 --> 12:08.680]  Yeah, give him a ring. Do you have his number?
[12:09.340 --> 12:11.660]  I don't, no. I'll just look
[12:11.660 --> 12:12.940]  to the sky every night and hope.
[12:14.940 --> 12:15.620]  When you wish
[12:15.620 --> 12:16.600]  upon a star, Andrew.
[12:17.160 --> 12:18.520]  When you wish upon a me,
[12:19.320 --> 12:20.000]  he says.
[12:22.500 --> 12:23.260]  That's what he says.
[12:23.260 --> 12:25.320]  Careful with the cactus, it'll hurt you.
[12:25.660 --> 12:27.060]  Yeah, keep running into that cactus.
[12:27.260 --> 12:28.760]  You left that other star back there.
[12:28.980 --> 12:31.220]  Where did the fire go? Remember when we were
[12:31.220 --> 12:33.160]  gonna play worms? You turned it off
[12:33.160 --> 12:35.280]  somehow. That's crazy. I was excited
[12:35.280 --> 12:36.780]  for worms. So was I.
[12:37.820 --> 12:38.220]  Uh...
[12:39.260 --> 12:39.660]  Yeah.
[12:41.460 --> 12:42.380]  That was exciting.
[12:43.120 --> 12:45.320]  There was a real fever dream the first time we played this.
[12:45.760 --> 12:47.040]  Oh my god, was it?
[12:48.600 --> 12:49.400]  How many times
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.680]  have you guys played Ratty Boy now?
[12:50.680 --> 12:52.700]  Three. Third time. This is the third time.
[12:52.900 --> 12:54.060]  Oh fuck. What are these?
[12:54.840 --> 12:56.620]  What's going on with this? These are just capped
[12:56.620 --> 12:57.620]  pipes. Yeah, dude.
[12:58.720 --> 13:00.800]  It's where the toilet was, they wanted to move it two feet.
[13:01.180 --> 13:02.300]  Yeah. I see.
[13:03.700 --> 13:04.800]  Somebody wasn't paying attention
[13:04.800 --> 13:06.420]  to code. Oh, this
[13:06.420 --> 13:07.660]  video isn't corrupt.
[13:09.040 --> 13:10.780]  It's not? No, it's
[13:10.780 --> 13:12.700]  just that you pressed... you did the
[13:12.700 --> 13:14.800]  thing where you recorded after the buffer and it's just
[13:14.800 --> 13:16.140]  like an hour of idle.
[13:17.360 --> 13:17.760]  No.
[13:19.200 --> 13:19.740]  What is
[13:19.740 --> 13:21.520]  no? Why are you saying no?
[13:22.380 --> 13:23.700]  What does that mean? What he's saying is
[13:23.700 --> 13:24.040]  wrong.
[13:25.660 --> 13:27.320]  Gavin, is what you're saying... you suck.
[13:27.320 --> 13:29.500]  The video starts on the
[13:30.340 --> 13:31.660]  finished screen, like we
[13:31.660 --> 13:33.720]  finished it all, and then it dims
[13:33.720 --> 13:35.620]  after 10 minutes and then it's an hour and
[13:35.620 --> 13:37.020]  20 minutes of a dimmed Xbox.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.380]  Yeah, well what happened was...
[13:39.380 --> 13:40.740]  I remember what happened.
[13:41.280 --> 13:42.040]  And I'll explain it to you.
[13:42.980 --> 13:43.800]  What do you mean?
[13:43.800 --> 13:45.680]  Let me explain
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.320]  to you what happened.
[13:46.660 --> 13:49.760]  I scrolled it back at the time
[13:50.600 --> 13:51.660]  because I did...
[13:51.660 --> 13:53.700]  I forgot to hit the record button, but then
[13:53.700 --> 13:55.620]  it has the recapture thing.
[13:56.240 --> 13:57.860]  So I scrolled it back all the way
[13:57.860 --> 13:59.720]  to the beginning and it broke.
[14:00.560 --> 14:01.720]  And it was just locked on
[14:01.720 --> 14:03.860]  that screen. It was a whole thing.
[14:04.500 --> 14:05.680]  Gavin, I asked you for
[14:05.680 --> 14:07.740]  tech support at the time. We tried to
[14:07.740 --> 14:08.600]  talk through it.
[14:10.540 --> 14:11.760]  Yeah, I like that I just said
[14:11.760 --> 14:13.000]  that and you said no though.
[14:13.260 --> 14:15.660]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I don't know why you said no.
[14:15.660 --> 14:17.640]  But I'm saying the flashback feature broke.
[14:17.760 --> 14:19.740]  Is what broke. No, I'm just saying
[14:19.740 --> 14:22.000]  it's not corrupt. You have a perfectly pristine
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.860]  recording of an hour and a half of the menu.
[14:24.140 --> 14:25.860]  Yeah, but it's not...
[14:27.520 --> 14:27.880]  Cheese.
[14:28.500 --> 14:29.340]  I used corrupt...
[14:29.340 --> 14:31.740]  I used corrupt in the sense
[14:31.740 --> 14:33.820]  that it did not do what it was
[14:33.820 --> 14:35.740]  supposed to. Oh, okay. I used corrupt when the
[14:35.740 --> 14:36.280]  video is corrupt.
[14:38.980 --> 14:39.880]  And not when...
[14:39.880 --> 14:41.900]  Listen, I'm not all
[14:41.900 --> 14:44.160]  fancy British like you.
[14:44.380 --> 14:45.600]  I use words...
[14:45.600 --> 14:47.160]  I use words loosely.
[14:47.700 --> 14:49.800]  You know, I'd feel slightly bad for
[14:49.800 --> 14:51.860]  how pedantic and bitchy Gavin's
[14:51.860 --> 14:53.920]  being right now if Andrew hadn't put him through the last two
[14:53.920 --> 14:54.980]  episodes. Yeah, that's true.
[14:55.880 --> 14:57.840]  Also, corrupt makes it
[14:57.840 --> 14:59.440]  sound like the computer did something wrong.
[14:59.660 --> 15:01.140]  It did. What?
[15:01.800 --> 15:03.340]  You forgot to press record.
[15:03.640 --> 15:05.600]  You forgot to press record. That's not corrupt.
[15:05.600 --> 15:07.800]  Yeah, but it has a setting where if you forget to hit record
[15:07.800 --> 15:09.700]  you can wind it back and then get
[15:09.700 --> 15:11.820]  what you missed. And I did that and it did not work
[15:11.820 --> 15:13.780]  properly. Yeah, the misuse of that feature
[15:13.780 --> 15:15.180]  can result in just recording
[15:15.860 --> 15:16.580]  after that.
[15:16.900 --> 15:18.220]  It didn't work.
[15:20.080 --> 15:21.860]  The misuse. Yeah, that's right. He used it
[15:21.860 --> 15:24.000]  right. That's why it didn't work. I sure did
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.800]  and it was broken and I asked you for help
[15:25.800 --> 15:27.860]  and you and I sat in a Discord call for like
[15:27.860 --> 15:29.920]  30 minutes but much like when we went to pinballs.
[15:30.360 --> 15:31.240]  You do not remember.
[15:32.580 --> 15:33.740]  I didn't remember
[15:33.740 --> 15:34.340]  it being this.
[15:34.340 --> 15:37.820]  I know we did go through that
[15:37.820 --> 15:39.440]  with something. I guess now I remember.
[15:39.720 --> 15:40.460]  It was that.
[15:44.040 --> 15:45.000]  Oh boy.
[15:45.300 --> 15:47.640]  So instead of trying to explain all
[15:47.640 --> 15:49.820]  of that, I felt it was just easier to say
[15:49.820 --> 15:51.660]  corrupt because it delivers
[15:51.660 --> 15:53.320]  the exact same point.
[15:53.460 --> 15:56.280]  Where do you want to go?
[15:56.480 --> 15:57.480]  I want to go home.
[15:57.700 --> 15:59.260]  I don't want to do this.
[15:59.500 --> 16:00.220]  Which is your home?
[16:01.380 --> 16:03.320]  Is there one that's just called home?
[16:03.320 --> 16:04.840]  I think we're in our home.
[16:05.740 --> 16:06.980]  Let's do gamer room.
[16:07.320 --> 16:09.000]  I want to hear what Gavin wants to say next.
[16:09.320 --> 16:11.120]  We're gamers in the gamer room.
[16:11.460 --> 16:13.000]  One, two, three.
[16:13.540 --> 16:15.380]  No, I was just saying I think we just had time to get
[16:15.380 --> 16:16.660]  to the bottom of it and I'm glad we did.
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.280]  Yeah, we absolutely did.
[16:22.100 --> 16:23.300]  It wouldn't be a strike for
[16:23.300 --> 16:25.300]  Nick though, right? I don't remember how he
[16:25.300 --> 16:27.200]  ruled on future baseball. He didn't turn his
[16:27.200 --> 16:29.360]  audio in. Yeah, but nobody asked
[16:29.360 --> 16:29.680]  for it.
[16:30.560 --> 16:31.120]  Oh.
[16:31.660 --> 16:32.940]  I didn't ask for it because the
[16:33.600 --> 16:35.060]  video was corrupt.
[16:35.660 --> 16:37.720]  Is that a strike for
[16:37.720 --> 16:38.000]  Andrew?
[16:39.980 --> 16:41.100]  It's not corrupt.
[16:41.320 --> 16:43.080]  It was never recorded.
[16:43.700 --> 16:45.700]  Well, it was
[16:45.700 --> 16:47.640]  recorded. Okay, I don't
[16:47.640 --> 16:49.620]  understand why you're so adamant that it
[16:49.620 --> 16:51.520]  was recorded, but you keep saying it wasn't
[16:51.520 --> 16:53.220]  recorded. I don't understand.
[16:54.180 --> 16:55.360]  It wasn't recorded.
[16:55.580 --> 16:57.900]  I forgot to hit the record
[16:57.900 --> 16:59.860]  at the time, but then
[16:59.860 --> 17:02.340]  there's a flashback, so I pulled it back.
[17:02.640 --> 17:03.920]  Okay, so it wasn't recorded.
[17:03.920 --> 17:05.880]  I think technically what Andrew's saying is it's
[17:05.880 --> 17:07.180]  always recorded, but then it was.
[17:07.400 --> 17:08.260]  But it's not recorded.
[17:10.540 --> 17:11.940]  There we go, Geoff.
[17:12.200 --> 17:13.300]  That's a great way to put it.
[17:14.140 --> 17:16.000]  It's always recording for two hours.
[17:17.760 --> 17:19.300]  But it wasn't recorded.
[17:20.760 --> 17:20.980]  No.
[17:22.380 --> 17:23.740]  Do you want a pillow, Guyer?
[17:24.440 --> 17:24.980]  Uh, yeah.
[17:26.140 --> 17:26.940]  Oh, Andrew,
[17:27.060 --> 17:28.980]  how do you feel about the Pope being the three-pillow
[17:28.980 --> 17:31.020]  guy? He's a three-pillow guy?
[17:31.240 --> 17:33.220]  Oh, no! How did you miss that job?
[17:33.220 --> 17:35.040]  A lot of people are saying, like, what are all the pillows for?
[17:35.220 --> 17:36.820]  And I was like, you call that all the pillows?
[17:38.220 --> 17:39.100]  What's going on
[17:39.100 --> 17:40.580]  over here? This is crazy.
[17:40.980 --> 17:43.120]  Um, do they have a new Pope yet?
[17:43.840 --> 17:44.980]  Nah, they haven't, uh...
[17:45.800 --> 17:47.140]  They haven't done the Pope pic yet.
[17:48.480 --> 17:51.480]  There's a Pope named Pete Zabala.
[17:51.820 --> 17:53.060]  I'm all about that, but
[17:53.060 --> 17:55.160]  I don't like anything else about that
[17:55.160 --> 17:56.820]  guy. It's real unfortunate.
[17:57.180 --> 17:58.420]  You don't like Pete Zabala's cool name?
[17:58.700 --> 17:59.720]  It's a great name.
[18:03.080 --> 18:04.400]  Get up on that pillow.
[18:05.600 --> 18:06.080]  There you go.
[18:06.440 --> 18:06.880]  Oh!
[18:08.760 --> 18:10.180]  You suck. Fuck!
[18:10.980 --> 18:12.020]  Why did I lose again?
[18:13.140 --> 18:14.780]  Ratty Boy's wearing a red shirt from Chicken Farm.
[18:15.340 --> 18:16.040]  Chicken Farm!
[18:16.760 --> 18:19.520]  I'm not getting Chicken Farm. I don't know where that came from.
[18:19.840 --> 18:20.280]  Geoff!
[18:21.760 --> 18:22.500]  I thought he said
[18:22.500 --> 18:23.640]  something about parm and chicken.
[18:24.200 --> 18:25.500]  I think he said...
[18:26.260 --> 18:27.040]  What did you say?
[18:27.360 --> 18:27.900]  I don't remember.
[18:29.460 --> 18:32.400]  I'm gonna make veggies with some
[18:32.400 --> 18:34.280]  parmesan, and then also probably
[18:34.280 --> 18:34.860]  have chicken.
[18:36.020 --> 18:37.620]  You're gonna, like, saute those veggies?
[18:37.640 --> 18:40.260]  So, you're gonna have parmesan, and you're going to have
[18:40.260 --> 18:42.320]  chicken. I'll smash them down and put them in the air fryer
[18:42.320 --> 18:43.420]  and then put, uh...
[18:44.160 --> 18:46.280]  Yeah, that's good. Dude, so I
[18:46.280 --> 18:48.160]  fucking nailed it when I said Chicken Farm.
[18:48.160 --> 18:50.480]  Yeah, you absolutely did.
[18:50.480 --> 18:51.680]  Eat both of those ingredients.
[18:51.960 --> 18:54.260]  And your tummy is not gonna know the difference when they're in there.
[18:54.860 --> 18:58.600]  I hate this. I hate this so much.
[19:00.540 --> 19:02.580]  Mouses will get crazy, right?
[19:02.880 --> 19:04.800]  Happy birthday, Eric!
[19:05.400 --> 19:06.480]  Happy birthday, Eric!
[19:06.540 --> 19:07.320]  Happy birthday!
[19:08.860 --> 19:10.060]  Enjoy your
[19:10.060 --> 19:12.220]  vegetables and parm and
[19:12.220 --> 19:12.680]  chicken.
[19:16.420 --> 19:18.580]  Dude, let's hear it for air fryers.
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.220]  Yeah, no doubt.
[19:20.760 --> 19:21.840]  Let's hear it for air fryers.
[19:21.840 --> 19:24.160]  You can beat the level. It's done. Go end this level.
[19:24.320 --> 19:26.840]  It's done. You did it. You got all the fucking cheese.
[19:27.320 --> 19:27.700]  You're right.
[19:28.180 --> 19:29.900]  31 is such a weird cheese amount.
[19:31.640 --> 19:32.400]  I forgot
[19:32.400 --> 19:33.220]  I could crawl.
[19:34.100 --> 19:35.360]  I'm a little rat boy crawling.
[19:35.400 --> 19:38.120]  My legs are so tired
[19:38.120 --> 19:39.920]  from getting all the cheese.
[19:40.140 --> 19:41.580]  We already did this.
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.440]  Nick, can you work with an editor
[19:44.440 --> 19:46.580]  to make sure that the audio...
[19:46.580 --> 19:47.220]  Well,
[19:48.140 --> 19:50.320]  it was recorded, but it didn't get recorded.
[19:50.500 --> 19:51.640]  It's corrupt, but not corrupt.
[19:53.100 --> 19:54.560]  Sounds like we need to go to the
[19:54.560 --> 19:55.480]  panic room.
[19:58.040 --> 20:00.500]  Nick, can you work with an editor to make sure that the audio
[20:00.500 --> 20:02.000]  comes out for this other one?
[20:02.540 --> 20:02.740]  Sure.
[20:05.280 --> 20:06.680]  Let me just text
[20:06.680 --> 20:07.280]  Dennis.
[20:08.540 --> 20:10.360]  So, what's going on with
[20:10.360 --> 20:11.220]  his left shoe?
[20:11.660 --> 20:14.900]  Why is his left shoe like that?
[20:14.900 --> 20:16.260]  It's all creased up.
[20:16.640 --> 20:17.880]  It's all creased up weird.
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.840]  So, if you go to regulationstore.com today,
[20:21.340 --> 20:22.460]  the day that this comes out,
[20:22.660 --> 20:24.040]  which is on my birthday,
[20:25.840 --> 20:27.240]  we will have
[20:27.240 --> 20:27.940]  ratty boy shirts.
[20:28.720 --> 20:31.460]  We will have two ratty boy shirts.
[20:32.040 --> 20:33.200]  Two different
[20:33.200 --> 20:33.920]  ratty boy shirts?
[20:34.020 --> 20:36.600]  Yeah, the original ratty boy shirt, and then
[20:36.600 --> 20:38.200]  ratty boy back with a vengeance.
[20:41.560 --> 20:42.780]  Will you be wearing
[20:42.780 --> 20:44.020]  either of those shirts today?
[20:45.380 --> 20:46.240]  No, I will not.
[20:46.460 --> 20:48.600]  Why not? I don't want them.
[20:48.840 --> 20:50.020]  He doesn't believe in our product.
[20:50.260 --> 20:51.860]  Would you rather wear that or the beret?
[20:52.520 --> 20:54.920]  We got you a
[20:54.920 --> 20:56.600]  gift card to the regulation
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.880]  store, but it can only be used on ratty boy
[20:58.880 --> 20:59.320]  merchandise.
[21:01.380 --> 21:02.940]  100% off.
[21:03.860 --> 21:04.280]  ratty boy.
[21:04.440 --> 21:05.540]  One koozler.
[21:08.800 --> 21:10.120]  I hate this guy.
[21:10.120 --> 21:12.280]  I hate this little
[21:12.280 --> 21:14.180]  freak. I'm trying to think if there's anything
[21:14.940 --> 21:16.100]  we haven't discovered
[21:16.100 --> 21:18.000]  in this game. It's like blueprints,
[21:18.100 --> 21:20.340]  there's a lot to find. I don't agree
[21:20.340 --> 21:21.000]  with that whatsoever.
[21:22.540 --> 21:24.000]  I was having the same feeling.
[21:24.400 --> 21:24.820]  Oh no.
[21:25.700 --> 21:27.200]  You thought you were stuck.
[21:27.800 --> 21:28.460]  I sure did.
[21:29.560 --> 21:31.500]  Would you rather play this or blueprints?
[21:32.800 --> 21:33.660]  That's a question.
[21:34.120 --> 21:35.940]  Blueprints, because it would be the first time.
[21:36.800 --> 21:38.220]  If it was the third time
[21:38.220 --> 21:40.160]  on blueprints and the third time on this, I think I would
[21:40.160 --> 21:41.460]  just sit quietly in the corner.
[21:43.420 --> 21:44.320]  Can I crawl
[21:44.320 --> 21:44.980]  underneath this?
[21:46.100 --> 21:47.140]  Hell no.
[21:48.280 --> 21:49.360]  Invisible wall.
[21:50.780 --> 21:51.480]  Won't let me.
[21:51.880 --> 21:54.340]  Gotta focus on the cheese.
[21:54.760 --> 21:55.660]  I'm excited about
[21:56.040 --> 21:57.000]  Faceoff season 2.
[21:57.640 --> 21:58.260]  That's cool.
[21:59.840 --> 22:00.680]  Thanks guys.
[22:02.680 --> 22:04.160]  I put a lot
[22:04.160 --> 22:06.180]  of building into the teams, and I
[22:06.180 --> 22:08.140]  want to go over it with Ichi to lock it in,
[22:08.240 --> 22:10.140]  but everything's essentially done
[22:10.140 --> 22:11.600]  from the design perspective.
[22:11.780 --> 22:13.260]  Thank you for doing all that, by the way.
[22:13.420 --> 22:14.120]  Of course.
[22:16.700 --> 22:18.320]  160 unique players.
[22:20.780 --> 22:21.260]  160
[22:22.040 --> 22:23.740]  unique players in season 2 of
[22:23.740 --> 22:24.240]  Faceoff.
[22:25.780 --> 22:27.240]  Jesus Christ. Gavin.
[22:28.980 --> 22:29.780]  Thank you, Andrew.
[22:30.660 --> 22:31.480]  He's gone.
[22:31.880 --> 22:32.840]  Gavin walked away.
[22:32.840 --> 22:34.060]  Gavin walked away.
[22:34.480 --> 22:36.900]  He's verifying the file. He's checking to see.
[22:37.120 --> 22:38.260]  He's seeing if he can save it.
[22:39.020 --> 22:40.780]  Gavin's the smartest one of all of us.
[22:41.200 --> 22:42.320]  Gavin's the only smart one here.
[22:42.540 --> 22:44.500]  Is your connection corrupt?
[22:45.620 --> 22:46.720]  No, my connection's fine.
[22:47.020 --> 22:47.320]  Oh, shit.
[22:48.340 --> 22:49.420]  Hey, it's Gavin. He's back.
[22:49.620 --> 22:52.380]  I was just saying something to my wife.
[22:53.380 --> 22:53.820]  Oh.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.260]  Are you telling her about stupid fucking ratty boy?
[22:56.720 --> 22:58.360]  No, I'm not gonna tell anyone about this.
[22:59.020 --> 22:59.500]  Laughing
[23:03.360 --> 23:03.840]  Laughing
[23:03.840 --> 23:04.000]  Laughing
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.260]  Has your wife heard our argument
[23:06.260 --> 23:07.780]  about future baseball, Gavin?
[23:08.020 --> 23:10.900]  This is gonna be our little secret.
[23:12.040 --> 23:14.440]  I'm not gonna tell. Not a soul.
[23:14.980 --> 23:16.560]  Andrew, do you think I should play for her?
[23:17.300 --> 23:18.380]  I would like to hear
[23:18.380 --> 23:19.160]  her ruling on it.
[23:19.680 --> 23:21.800]  She's had a lot of rulings either way.
[23:22.560 --> 23:24.080]  So I think it would be
[23:24.080 --> 23:25.440]  a valuable insight.
[23:25.440 --> 23:26.920]  You missed the chair.
[23:27.240 --> 23:28.480]  What was the main audience
[23:29.220 --> 23:29.740]  consensus?
[23:30.720 --> 23:32.300]  That Andrew was right, I think.
[23:33.920 --> 23:34.560]  This is very split.
[23:36.220 --> 23:37.320]  Nobody's on my side
[23:37.320 --> 23:39.440]  regarding the Australian morning show.
[23:39.720 --> 23:41.660]  But the future baseball
[23:41.660 --> 23:42.580]  very split.
[23:43.520 --> 23:45.760]  I don't even really know what the sides are.
[23:47.920 --> 23:49.580]  I thought he was on your side the whole time.
[23:49.700 --> 23:51.480]  Just know that everyone's on yours, Gavin.
[23:51.480 --> 23:52.300]  I am on his side.
[23:52.300 --> 23:53.380]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[23:53.600 --> 23:56.140]  I think it was pretty clear that
[23:56.140 --> 23:58.160]  Andrew was advocating for Gavin the entire time.
[23:58.200 --> 23:59.820]  You collected all the cheese, that's it.
[24:00.560 --> 24:02.500]  I'm done. 59? You sure about that?
[24:02.840 --> 24:04.500]  Yes! I'm fucking sure!
[24:05.840 --> 24:07.580]  You ended on 31 last time.
[24:08.140 --> 24:09.240]  So this is the panic room.
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.840]  Can I crawl underneath this?
[24:12.160 --> 24:13.340]  Oh my god, yes!
[24:13.900 --> 24:15.240]  What if I try to stand in the middle?
[24:15.340 --> 24:18.060]  No panicking here though, he was grace under pressure.
[24:18.820 --> 24:19.260]  Graceful.
[24:19.680 --> 24:20.580]  Grace under fire.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.460]  Get this rat on the fucking
[24:23.460 --> 24:24.900]  Australian morning news.
[24:26.580 --> 24:27.560]  Why did you start?
[24:27.680 --> 24:28.560]  Do you think, Gavin,
[24:29.040 --> 24:31.920]  maybe you'll do an interview about this video in 10-12 years?
[24:32.760 --> 24:33.340]  That could happen.
[24:34.020 --> 24:36.080]  But like I said, I'm never gonna mention it to anyone.
[24:36.800 --> 24:37.360]  Yeah, it's true.
[24:37.760 --> 24:40.040]  You're just gonna be silent the whole time they're asking you about it?
[24:40.040 --> 24:41.960]  They ask you about it, you're just gonna sit quietly.
[24:42.400 --> 24:43.560]  No comment.
[24:44.100 --> 24:45.840]  Even if they show a clip where I'm speaking,
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.200]  I'm just gonna say I wasn't in it.
[24:49.540 --> 24:51.840]  Now that doesn't work well for you, trust me.
[24:53.140 --> 24:54.400]  People don't like that.
[24:55.060 --> 24:56.020]  Do you have any more
[24:58.500 --> 24:59.460]  breakfast TV
[24:59.460 --> 25:00.640]  appearances scheduled?
[25:01.340 --> 25:02.240]  Not currently.
[25:03.620 --> 25:05.300]  Do you have any midday appearances?
[25:05.760 --> 25:07.380]  I was gonna say, are you a breakfast only guy?
[25:08.460 --> 25:09.400]  I might declare
[25:09.400 --> 25:11.420]  2026 as like a lunch only
[25:11.420 --> 25:12.100]  appearance guy.
[25:12.540 --> 25:14.880]  Are there lunch TV shows?
[25:16.600 --> 25:17.260]  Yeah, there's like
[25:17.260 --> 25:18.600]  midday whatever.
[25:19.400 --> 25:21.120]  Yeah. Like midday
[25:21.120 --> 25:22.000]  Austin or whatever.
[25:25.180 --> 25:27.120]  Oh, he's gonna spaff on the space bar
[25:27.120 --> 25:27.500]  again.
[25:33.740 --> 25:34.980]  Is this a weird keyboard?
[25:35.960 --> 25:36.560]  What is this?
[25:37.640 --> 25:38.840]  That is a fucked up keyboard.
[25:39.440 --> 25:40.620]  I don't know what's going on over here.
[25:40.620 --> 25:42.180]  It's cause you mucked off all the keys.
[25:43.720 --> 25:45.400]  Give me all the keys!
[25:46.900 --> 25:47.400]  Jesus.
[25:48.240 --> 25:49.260]  No brand on it.
[25:50.360 --> 25:51.360]  I'm wondering
[25:51.360 --> 25:53.460]  if the music is what's giving me a headache.
[25:53.660 --> 25:54.240]  Yeah, I agree.
[25:55.540 --> 25:57.000]  It is a...
[25:57.000 --> 25:57.740]  You suck.
[25:58.500 --> 25:59.760]  I can't turn off the music.
[25:59.960 --> 26:00.440]  Oh my god.
[26:02.740 --> 26:04.920]  What was the arcade game that was supposedly
[26:04.920 --> 26:06.960]  giving people headaches and migraines and shit?
[26:07.620 --> 26:08.400]  Polybius or something?
[26:09.020 --> 26:09.860]  Oh, Polybius?
[26:10.140 --> 26:11.360]  Oh yeah, I remember that.
[26:11.360 --> 26:13.280]  It was like in the 80s, right?
[26:15.320 --> 26:16.540]  Isn't that remembered legend?
[26:16.700 --> 26:17.860]  Did that game ever really exist?
[26:18.620 --> 26:20.240]  It's like MKUltra shit, I think.
[26:23.680 --> 26:25.000]  Ratty Boy is MKUltra.
[26:25.480 --> 26:26.500]  I agree with that.
[26:27.160 --> 26:28.940]  If anyone is like a CIA
[26:29.380 --> 26:30.680]  psyop, you suck!
[26:30.960 --> 26:31.740]  It's Ratty Boy.
[26:36.560 --> 26:39.000]  If you had to play this level perfectly, Andrew,
[26:39.080 --> 26:41.000]  and you could never miss a jump, or the world
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.920]  would end, do you think it would make you play better?
[26:42.980 --> 26:43.360]  World's over.
[26:43.720 --> 26:45.300]  How many worlds do I got?
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.480]  This is the only world, and you doing this jump
[26:49.480 --> 26:51.000]  saves the world.
[26:51.760 --> 26:52.120]  Wow.
[26:53.300 --> 26:53.980]  Now he missed a cheese.
[26:58.420 --> 27:00.080]  I don't know why I did that.
[27:00.600 --> 27:01.580]  Oh, fuck.
[27:01.860 --> 27:02.720]  The world is gone.
[27:04.740 --> 27:06.020]  There goes Saturn.
[27:12.580 --> 27:13.360]  Now this is
[27:13.360 --> 27:15.020]  the tough jump right here.
[27:15.840 --> 27:18.040]  Line it up.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.040]  Nice jump!
[27:21.640 --> 27:23.160]  You keep up making moves like that,
[27:23.220 --> 27:25.140]  and before you know it, you're gonna be a ratty man.
[27:25.840 --> 27:26.920]  Oh, I'm a ratty man?
[27:28.160 --> 27:29.360]  Hopefully they end him.
[27:29.520 --> 27:31.240]  Hopefully this is the year that Ratty Boy's name
[27:31.240 --> 27:33.120]  is put up there with the paintress or whatever
[27:33.120 --> 27:34.060]  so he fucking dies.
[27:35.560 --> 27:37.580]  He just writes Ratty Boy
[27:37.580 --> 27:38.320]  in his jacket.
[27:38.320 --> 27:39.440]  The number gets raised.
[27:39.860 --> 27:42.440]  It was 33, it gets raised to just say Ratty Boy
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.080]  and he turns into, like, not even
[27:44.820 --> 27:45.260]  feathers.
[27:48.520 --> 27:50.660]  He just turns into cheese and it flies away.
[27:51.200 --> 27:52.260]  Why are you ignoring stars?
[27:53.100 --> 27:54.000]  He's not a stars guy.
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.140]  I'm not a star guy.
[27:55.200 --> 27:57.040]  I didn't get many stars.
[27:58.200 --> 27:59.820]  Getting used to it. I'm adopting it.
[27:59.900 --> 28:01.540]  We'll do one more in the gym.
[28:02.160 --> 28:03.340]  Thank God, only one more.
[28:03.580 --> 28:05.680]  Do you think you'll be a stars guy tomorrow?
[28:06.400 --> 28:08.320]  Uh, I could be a stars guy tomorrow.
[28:09.400 --> 28:11.140]  You want me to be a stars guy tomorrow?
[28:11.240 --> 28:13.640]  If you want me to be a stars guy tomorrow, I'll be a stars guy tomorrow.
[28:13.740 --> 28:15.800]  I think he said, because we're playing Mario Party.
[28:15.800 --> 28:17.460]  We're playing to Mario Party.
[28:17.780 --> 28:19.700]  Oh yeah, this comes out on May 10th
[28:19.700 --> 28:21.140]  which is Eric's birthday!
[28:21.540 --> 28:23.640]  Yeah, and tomorrow, if you're watching this on May 10th
[28:23.640 --> 28:24.840]  The extravaganza!
[28:25.120 --> 28:27.340]  Then tomorrow, we'll be streaming
[28:27.340 --> 28:29.120]  starting at 11 a.m. Central Time.
[28:29.240 --> 28:31.840]  We'll be streaming Mario Party
[28:31.840 --> 28:33.400]  for our anniversary and
[28:33.400 --> 28:36.020]  some other cool surprises that don't have anything to do with Ratty Boy.
[28:36.320 --> 28:37.200]  So, today's Ratty Boy.
[28:37.700 --> 28:39.700]  But if you're watching this at any point in the future,
[28:39.800 --> 28:40.760]  that's useless information.
[28:41.020 --> 28:44.360]  Absolutely, but you can go back and find it or whatever.
[28:44.560 --> 28:45.480]  I'm not sure if we can even guarantee
[28:45.480 --> 28:46.820]  that it's nothing to do with Ratty Boy.
[28:47.380 --> 28:49.280]  Andrew could be working on a live Blindside.
[28:49.700 --> 28:50.480]  Oh shit.
[28:50.760 --> 28:51.700]  He's used his Blindside.
[28:52.860 --> 28:54.900]  He's used his video game Blindside.
[28:54.960 --> 28:55.820]  He's used his Blindside.
[28:56.320 --> 28:58.640]  Also, he could be playing Time Machine Blindside.
[28:59.000 --> 28:59.600]  You can't.
[28:59.600 --> 29:01.060]  I used mine.
[29:01.420 --> 29:02.540]  No, I used it last year.
[29:03.040 --> 29:05.060]  He could do movie or TV Blindside still.
[29:05.160 --> 29:06.340]  Yep, I sure can.
[29:07.580 --> 29:09.180]  I squeaked mine out in December
[29:09.180 --> 29:10.220]  so it would reset.
[29:10.520 --> 29:11.060]  It's true.
[29:12.260 --> 29:13.260]  I haven't done one yet.
[29:13.580 --> 29:16.280]  In the history of the show, you haven't done one, I don't think.
[29:16.680 --> 29:17.340]  I might do one today.
[29:20.340 --> 29:21.100]  What today?
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.480]  Today, we're recording this?
[29:22.560 --> 29:23.580]  Or today, May 10th?
[29:24.820 --> 29:26.020]  Today, this day.
[29:26.020 --> 29:27.180]  God damn it.
[29:27.300 --> 29:27.820]  Fuck.
[29:28.780 --> 29:29.260]  Hey.
[29:33.100 --> 29:34.800]  Anything else around here I need?
[29:36.040 --> 29:36.560]  Jeez.
[29:38.940 --> 29:40.160]  Just get the occasional
[29:40.160 --> 29:42.740]  glimpse of his stupid face.
[29:43.080 --> 29:43.360]  Yep.
[29:44.080 --> 29:44.800]  On this face?
[29:45.080 --> 29:47.740]  Imagine owning that face on a t-shirt or two t-shirts.
[29:48.040 --> 29:49.440]  Wait, how do I get his face?
[29:49.440 --> 29:50.240]  Wear it with pride, Eric.
[29:50.700 --> 29:53.640]  Eric, you're with him, aren't you?
[29:53.960 --> 29:55.320]  No, I...
[29:55.320 --> 29:56.900]  Now you see me? Now you don't.
[29:57.080 --> 29:58.180]  Now you see me? Now you don't.
[29:59.120 --> 30:00.800]  Wait, go down again.
[30:01.600 --> 30:03.420]  Andrew's doing video game magic tricks again.
[30:03.680 --> 30:04.560]  All the way down out of frame.
[30:06.020 --> 30:06.240]  Alright.
[30:06.620 --> 30:08.160]  All the way down. Yep.
[30:08.920 --> 30:09.700]  All the way down.
[30:10.900 --> 30:12.760]  Now just stay like that.
[30:14.260 --> 30:14.700]  Yep.
[30:15.600 --> 30:16.180]  And that's it.
[30:16.760 --> 30:17.180]  And that's it.
[30:18.900 --> 30:20.140]  And thanks for watching.
[30:21.780 --> 30:23.300]  Does it say trial
[30:23.300 --> 30:24.580]  version in the bottom
[30:25.660 --> 30:27.180]  right of the screen?
[30:27.580 --> 30:28.800]  What does that say?
[30:29.160 --> 30:30.100]  What are you looking at?
[30:30.400 --> 30:32.880]  What does that say?
[30:33.160 --> 30:34.760]  You're playing the trial of Ratty Boy?
[30:35.300 --> 30:37.160]  You haven't even gotten the fucking game?
[30:37.260 --> 30:39.500]  If Ratty Boy's on trial, he's fucking guilty.
[30:39.680 --> 30:41.080]  Lock him up and throw away the game.
[30:41.340 --> 30:43.440]  I'm taking a photo so I can zoom in on this.
[30:43.520 --> 30:45.140]  I can't read my screen. It's so small.
[30:45.220 --> 30:46.060]  It says trial version.
[30:46.940 --> 30:47.900]  Trial version?
[30:50.720 --> 30:51.160]  Trial version?
[30:51.160 --> 30:53.240]  I'm trying to figure out why...
[30:53.240 --> 30:55.780]  The official game says trial version.
[30:56.880 --> 30:58.100]  Are you sure it's the official game?
[30:58.420 --> 30:59.940]  Did you buy the proper game?
[31:00.740 --> 31:01.780]  I bought the proper game.
[31:01.860 --> 31:03.820]  I think whatever software they use
[31:03.820 --> 31:05.760]  to make this is the trial version
[31:05.760 --> 31:06.280]  of the game.
[31:07.900 --> 31:09.680]  You have to pay to get that removed.
[31:11.020 --> 31:12.000]  Why don't you just shrink it down
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.120]  and hope nobody notices until Andrew...
[31:15.200 --> 31:16.660]  Well, in their defense,
[31:16.820 --> 31:18.120]  this is my third playthrough.
[31:18.480 --> 31:19.780]  So it's pretty effective.
[31:20.320 --> 31:21.960]  How can we see your screen
[31:21.960 --> 31:22.900]  clearer than you?
[31:26.460 --> 31:28.260]  Regardless of what screen it is,
[31:28.320 --> 31:30.340]  I'm working with my eyes, unfortunately.
[31:30.560 --> 31:32.140]  You got gammy eyes?
[31:33.800 --> 31:36.300]  I mean, do you see the jumping we're doing right now?
[31:37.640 --> 31:40.020]  I don't think you're supposed to go like that.
[31:40.280 --> 31:42.040]  Remember the dumbbells?
[31:42.040 --> 31:42.740]  Remember how long?
[31:43.380 --> 31:43.980]  Oh, I remember.
[31:45.380 --> 31:47.140]  He climbed them for no reason.
[31:48.100 --> 31:49.260]  Kind of like this.
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.040]  I know, but...
[32:00.860 --> 32:03.240]  So you know how last year was
[32:03.920 --> 32:04.960]  rat summer?
[32:05.520 --> 32:05.740]  Yeah.
[32:06.420 --> 32:08.860]  Do you think 2025 should be rat summer?
[32:09.280 --> 32:09.920]  Absolutely.
[32:09.920 --> 32:11.400]  And it's ratty boy?
[32:11.640 --> 32:13.060]  Just do ratty boy themed everything.
[32:13.240 --> 32:15.840]  I want to see the ratty boy dance on TikTok.
[32:17.840 --> 32:18.860]  It's pretty easy.
[32:23.880 --> 32:25.860]  We should sell rat summer shirts.
[32:26.020 --> 32:27.280]  It would go like...
[32:27.280 --> 32:29.180]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[32:29.400 --> 32:31.160]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[32:31.480 --> 32:32.980]  Do a spin, do a spin, do a spin.
[32:33.400 --> 32:35.160]  Spin the other way, spin the other way.
[32:35.740 --> 32:36.860]  Jump in the coffee pot.
[32:36.860 --> 32:39.260]  Coffee cup.
[32:43.380 --> 32:44.580]  Oh, God.
[32:44.700 --> 32:45.780]  He's a dirty baby.
[32:46.120 --> 32:47.660]  He's a dirty little ratty boy.
[32:51.340 --> 32:53.180]  Oh, fuck me.
[32:57.400 --> 32:59.060]  How did you get it
[32:59.060 --> 33:00.100]  and won that time?
[33:00.580 --> 33:02.180]  I think this side's easier.
[33:03.040 --> 33:04.520]  Yeah, so far it's been great.
[33:06.880 --> 33:10.100]  I hate him so much.
[33:10.880 --> 33:12.660]  Andrew or the rat?
[33:14.260 --> 33:16.420]  Hey, Geoff, I said what I said.
[33:17.720 --> 33:20.400]  Nice, nice, nice.
[33:22.580 --> 33:23.840]  Up to create a team.
[33:25.020 --> 33:26.280]  Got it.
[33:27.460 --> 33:28.420]  Yeah!
[33:30.700 --> 33:31.920]  Nice jump.
[33:32.560 --> 33:33.660]  Thank you.
[33:38.670 --> 33:39.730]  Crawl to victory.
[33:40.010 --> 33:40.790]  Son of a bitch.
[33:40.970 --> 33:43.570]  And with that, it is the end of
[33:43.570 --> 33:45.230]  Eric's birthday extravaganza.
[33:45.330 --> 33:46.630]  Happy birthday, Eric.
[33:48.630 --> 33:50.390]  Enjoy your two new
[33:50.390 --> 33:51.610]  ratty boy shirts.
[33:52.890 --> 33:53.990]  Regulationstore.com
[33:53.990 --> 33:55.370]  or regulationstore.store.
[33:55.530 --> 33:57.890]  Grab them, show them that you're celebrating
[33:58.330 --> 33:59.090]  rat summer.
[34:00.090 --> 34:02.030]  And be on the lookout for the audio version
[34:02.030 --> 34:03.930]  of the first take of this blindside.
[34:03.930 --> 34:05.790]  Which was recorded almost
[34:05.790 --> 34:08.130]  a year ago. 11 months, I think.
[34:08.350 --> 34:08.890]  At this moment.
[34:09.250 --> 34:12.130]  So we've been hanging on to it, and then it's gone.
[34:12.730 --> 34:13.610]  What were you keeping it for?
[34:13.650 --> 34:14.270]  For the shirt?
[34:15.370 --> 34:17.110]  Yeah, we didn't have a store when I made it.
[34:17.150 --> 34:19.530]  Because I commissioned a shirt design for
[34:19.530 --> 34:21.590]  new ratty boy to celebrate new ratty boy.
[34:21.890 --> 34:23.690]  But now it gets to come out on Eric's birthday
[34:23.690 --> 34:26.030]  as a birthday extravaganza. I think it's even better.
[34:26.470 --> 34:28.270]  It all worked out in the end.
[34:29.210 --> 34:29.370]  What?
[34:30.050 --> 34:31.490]  Why did you have us record it
[34:31.490 --> 34:32.670]  10 months ago?
[34:33.010 --> 34:34.150]  11 months ago?
[34:36.110 --> 34:37.550]  Talk to you soon!
[34:37.730 --> 34:39.790]  Love you guys! We'll see you tomorrow!
[34:40.350 --> 34:40.690]  Bye!
