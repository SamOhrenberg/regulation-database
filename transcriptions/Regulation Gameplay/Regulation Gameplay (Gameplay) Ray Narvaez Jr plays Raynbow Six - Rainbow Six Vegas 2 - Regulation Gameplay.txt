[00:01.060 --> 00:03.240]  This 360 friends list is a mess.
[00:03.340 --> 00:06.420]  It is. It's super laggy and it just doesn't work.
[00:07.400 --> 00:08.600]  Alright, this one for Geoff.
[00:09.600 --> 00:10.180]  I'm Geoff.
[00:10.500 --> 00:11.180]  Geoff, could you invite...
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.660]  I'm about to lose control...
[00:12.660 --> 00:12.920]  What'd you say?
[00:12.940 --> 00:13.740]  Oh, I see it. Never mind.
[00:13.920 --> 00:14.900]  He's not my friend. I can't do that.
[00:14.900 --> 00:16.080]  I thought I didn't have Andrew for a sec.
[00:16.720 --> 00:17.940]  Yeah, I blocked Geoff.
[00:18.900 --> 00:19.080]  Yeah.
[00:20.080 --> 00:22.540]  We haven't... things haven't... we haven't been... we used to be better friends.
[00:22.740 --> 00:22.900]  Oh.
[00:23.140 --> 00:24.820]  Before the whole condiment incident.
[00:25.560 --> 00:25.840]  Uh-huh.
[00:27.540 --> 00:27.900]  Well...
[00:27.900 --> 00:29.900]  I'm glad we got clarity on what was right and wrong.
[00:31.320 --> 00:32.360]  Brown man wants to be a friend.
[00:32.900 --> 00:33.320]  Yo, yo!
[00:33.880 --> 00:34.940]  How do you zoom in?
[00:35.740 --> 00:36.540]  How do you zoom in?
[00:37.120 --> 00:37.480]  Uh...
[00:37.480 --> 00:37.800]  I don't know.
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.320]  The day I met Ray, I just...
[00:41.860 --> 00:43.360]  I just walked up to him and shouted,
[00:43.940 --> 00:44.660]  Brown man!
[00:44.760 --> 00:45.880]  And he was like, you know, oh, Ray.
[00:46.580 --> 00:47.060]  Ray's good.
[00:47.520 --> 00:52.060]  Well, you were drunk with your bacon scarf at like PAX 2013 or whatever. 2012.
[00:52.420 --> 00:54.140]  Sick bacon scarf. Still got that thing.
[00:55.000 --> 00:55.540]  Bring it back.
[00:56.880 --> 00:58.580]  Alright, I accepted your invite, Ray.
[00:58.840 --> 00:59.980]  And now I've invited you to the game.
[01:00.260 --> 01:00.500]  Okay.
[01:00.800 --> 01:03.900]  I can't accept Gavin's friend request, but hopefully I can take the invite.
[01:05.200 --> 01:06.160]  Yeah, I'm like...
[01:06.160 --> 01:07.780]  Is it in-game or is it on...
[01:07.780 --> 01:09.080]  I assume it's on Xbox you're sending, right?
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.600]  Yeah, I'm just sending you a dashboard.
[01:11.120 --> 01:11.420]  Okay.
[01:12.120 --> 01:12.980]  I'm not even getting it.
[01:13.000 --> 01:13.920]  I'm just getting the friend request.
[01:14.040 --> 01:14.560]  Let me try clearing...
[01:16.040 --> 01:17.320]  Clearing some shit out and see if that helps.
[01:17.480 --> 01:18.900]  Yeah, I'm gonna remove someone.
[01:19.160 --> 01:19.740]  See if that will...
[01:19.740 --> 01:20.900]  I can't even delete people.
[01:22.480 --> 01:22.800]  Remove...
[01:22.800 --> 01:23.460]  No, shit!
[01:23.580 --> 01:24.600]  I didn't mean to invite him to game.
[01:29.440 --> 01:30.160]  Remove friend.
[01:30.540 --> 01:31.360]  Oh, let me remove him.
[01:31.440 --> 01:31.660]  Okay.
[01:32.160 --> 01:32.820]  That's cool.
[01:33.300 --> 01:34.680]  It is not letting me join.
[01:35.100 --> 01:36.160]  Alright, let's do public lobby.
[01:36.620 --> 01:37.580]  Yeah, try public lobby.
[01:37.720 --> 01:38.780]  Let me see.
[01:40.040 --> 01:40.960]  Andro, it's not a new lobby.
[01:42.240 --> 01:43.920]  Oh, I think I might know what the problem is.
[01:44.300 --> 01:44.640]  Oh, really?
[01:44.920 --> 01:46.480]  It just told me I need to buy Xbox Gold.
[01:47.040 --> 01:47.940]  Oh my god!
[01:53.200 --> 01:53.820]  Why is it...
[01:53.820 --> 01:55.220]  Wait, but I'm logged in.
[01:55.620 --> 01:56.840]  That is so funny.
[01:57.500 --> 01:58.900]  I'm so glad we're recording.
[01:59.080 --> 01:59.960]  I can't believe it.
[01:59.960 --> 02:01.020]  What the fuck?
[02:01.080 --> 02:02.080]  I'm on Xbox Live.
[02:03.440 --> 02:05.640]  How do I do that on the 360?
[02:06.280 --> 02:06.980]  Oh, shit.
[02:12.800 --> 02:13.580]  Hey, Andro.
[02:13.660 --> 02:14.280]  Are you still there?
[02:14.340 --> 02:14.780]  It's Geoff.
[02:15.080 --> 02:15.680]  Let me give you a little update.
[02:15.680 --> 02:16.120]  Hi, Geoff.
[02:16.220 --> 02:17.400]  Yeah, I appreciate the update.
[02:17.660 --> 02:19.480]  I know he's downloading all of his gamerscore.
[02:20.400 --> 02:20.540]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:20.540 --> 02:22.860]  He's downloading two and a half million gamerscore right now.
[02:22.960 --> 02:23.580]  It takes some time.
[02:24.420 --> 02:28.660]  Also, Gavin played a really, really good round of Earthshaker earlier.
[02:29.560 --> 02:29.660]  Oh, shit.
[02:29.660 --> 02:31.540]  And he got 5.3 million points.
[02:31.540 --> 02:33.820]  But he needed 5.5 to make the leaderboard.
[02:34.060 --> 02:34.800]  So he was just shy.
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.400]  But it was so fucking close.
[02:36.840 --> 02:38.920]  Once everyone's in, we'll just make sure all the heads are showing up.
[02:39.020 --> 02:40.040]  And then I guess we'll stop.
[02:40.200 --> 02:40.620]  Hey, he's in.
[02:41.100 --> 02:41.500]  I'm in.
[02:41.740 --> 02:42.480]  He's in.
[02:42.880 --> 02:43.840]  Oh, look who's level eight.
[02:44.120 --> 02:44.440]  Wow.
[02:45.320 --> 02:46.400]  I told you I played a lot.
[02:48.380 --> 02:49.560]  Apparently, I didn't.
[02:49.680 --> 02:50.260]  Oh, we're in.
[02:50.700 --> 02:51.660]  Oh, we are in.
[02:52.300 --> 02:52.780]  All right, boys.
[02:52.800 --> 02:53.380]  Let me look at you.
[02:53.520 --> 02:54.840]  Let me get a look at your beautiful face.
[02:54.840 --> 02:55.640]  Oh, my God.
[02:55.900 --> 02:55.940]  Oh, Ray.
[02:56.460 --> 02:57.440]  I swear to God, Ray.
[02:57.480 --> 03:00.180]  I don't remember the last time we played this game, but you haven't aged a day.
[03:00.180 --> 03:01.800]  I've been very, very lucky.
[03:01.900 --> 03:03.280]  You still look like a male.
[03:03.380 --> 03:04.320]  Oh, my God.
[03:04.820 --> 03:06.260]  You look like you shit your pants.
[03:06.560 --> 03:06.940]  What's up?
[03:07.100 --> 03:07.580]  What's up, Ray?
[03:08.180 --> 03:08.700]  Not much, man.
[03:08.840 --> 03:09.100]  Not much.
[03:09.160 --> 03:11.020]  It looks like your glasses are tattooed on.
[03:11.260 --> 03:11.600]  They are.
[03:11.760 --> 03:12.320]  They are, actually.
[03:13.460 --> 03:18.200]  Gavin looks like he's on posters that say, in accordance with Megan's law, this man cannot
[03:18.200 --> 03:19.400]  be without a hundred feet of school.
[03:20.540 --> 03:22.140]  You've got like a hair strap.
[03:22.260 --> 03:24.280]  You've got like a helmet strap over the top of your head.
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.040]  I'm in my fifties.
[03:25.260 --> 03:26.280]  Is your guy's balding?
[03:26.520 --> 03:27.180]  How'd you do that?
[03:27.280 --> 03:28.400]  Is that the hat you were wearing?
[03:30.260 --> 03:31.780]  Why is Andrew hiding in a corner?
[03:31.920 --> 03:33.060]  I'm Blair Witching.
[03:33.060 --> 03:33.900]  Oh, really?
[03:33.900 --> 03:34.540]  Are you ready?
[03:34.600 --> 03:35.880]  Are you ready for my reveal?
[03:36.160 --> 03:38.520]  This is the first time we've seen Andrew in a couple years.
[03:38.940 --> 03:44.500]  You guys better not do anything too shady, because I'll be watching you with all four
[03:44.500 --> 03:45.300]  of my eyes.
[03:46.260 --> 03:47.520]  What's going on there?
[03:47.540 --> 03:49.200]  I've got all my eyes on you.
[03:49.380 --> 03:50.600]  Jesus Christ.
[03:51.560 --> 03:52.900]  I guess I've got an elder for her.
[03:53.400 --> 03:54.960]  You've got like an eyebrow eye.
[03:56.720 --> 03:58.240]  I'm watching every corner.
[03:58.240 --> 04:00.380]  Does your guy have a headphone dent?
[04:00.400 --> 04:01.120]  What's in your head?
[04:01.620 --> 04:03.200]  Andrew's eyes are in stereo.
[04:03.380 --> 04:05.620]  Do you have an eye on your ear as well?
[04:05.900 --> 04:07.020]  Wait, do I have ear eyes?
[04:07.280 --> 04:08.280]  Check, check, do I?
[04:09.980 --> 04:11.140]  It looks like it tried.
[04:11.240 --> 04:12.520]  You've got some marking on your ear.
[04:14.020 --> 04:14.860]  Oh no.
[04:15.520 --> 04:17.180]  That's actually worse when you're on a wall.
[04:18.060 --> 04:19.880]  I'm watching all of you.
[04:20.280 --> 04:23.080]  This is the first time I've seen Andrew in maybe seven years.
[04:23.400 --> 04:24.680]  Accurate representation.
[04:25.300 --> 04:26.440]  That's really good.
[04:27.140 --> 04:27.580]  Jesus.
[04:27.580 --> 04:29.940]  Alright, let's kill some milky terrorists.
[04:30.480 --> 04:37.060]  Andrew looks like he's the kind of guy who goes to middle schools to give a speech about how if you get blown up in a fire, your life's not over.
[04:37.580 --> 04:39.120]  You can still do stuff.
[04:41.240 --> 04:43.400]  Do we want to go out this door or up the stairs?
[04:43.740 --> 04:45.000]  Ray, you're good at this, you remember.
[04:45.100 --> 04:46.240]  We'll go up the stairs, I remember.
[04:46.540 --> 04:47.080]  We're going up the stairs?
[04:47.440 --> 04:47.740]  Yeah.
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.700]  Are we saving RTX or something, Ray? We're at a convention?
[04:51.060 --> 04:51.440]  What's happening?
[04:52.920 --> 04:54.060]  I've never done this one?
[04:54.520 --> 04:54.780]  I don't know.
[04:55.800 --> 04:56.940]  What difficulty are we on?
[04:57.920 --> 04:58.280]  Realistic.
[04:58.660 --> 04:59.200]  Oh, hell yeah.
[05:00.100 --> 05:01.640]  With high enemy density.
[05:02.360 --> 05:04.160]  How do you- oh god, I put on- okay.
[05:04.520 --> 05:06.060]  If you hold the right bumper, you can put on the goggles.
[05:06.380 --> 05:07.580]  How do you use a breaching charge?
[05:08.200 --> 05:09.100]  Get away from me.
[05:10.520 --> 05:11.680]  I'm watching you all.
[05:13.960 --> 05:15.100]  Mate, you put in your notes-
[05:15.100 --> 05:15.700]  Oh, that doesn't sound good.
[05:15.700 --> 05:16.040]  Oh shit!
[05:16.140 --> 05:16.980]  Oh god, behind us.
[05:18.180 --> 05:18.460]  I'm down!
[05:19.080 --> 05:19.700]  Geoff's dead!
[05:20.140 --> 05:21.180]  Geoff died already.
[05:23.400 --> 05:24.260]  I'm watching the flank!
[05:24.260 --> 05:25.100]  You don't come back, Ray, you're just dead.
[05:25.800 --> 05:27.700]  I think you get one life, don't you? One extra life?
[05:27.760 --> 05:27.920]  No.
[05:28.400 --> 05:29.180]  Oh, you're just gone?
[05:29.580 --> 05:30.520]  Yeah, it's realistic.
[05:30.940 --> 05:31.140]  Oh.
[05:31.540 --> 05:32.220]  I got a guy!
[05:32.780 --> 05:33.140]  Okay.
[05:33.900 --> 05:35.160]  Alright, we- oh, I'm in!
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.940]  I guess you get one extra life.
[05:38.320 --> 05:39.040]  It's realistic.
[05:39.780 --> 05:40.340]  Oh shit.
[05:40.340 --> 05:43.420]  Is that team shared, or do we all just get one?
[05:43.820 --> 05:47.100]  Oh, yeah, it might be a group life that Geoff's used on one enemy.
[05:48.420 --> 05:49.900]  How did that guy live all that way?
[05:49.900 --> 05:50.900]  Oh!
[05:52.220 --> 05:52.820]  Gavin!
[05:54.000 --> 05:54.600]  Okay.
[05:56.880 --> 05:58.660]  Is there a guy coming up the stairs?
[05:59.480 --> 06:00.380]  I avenged him.
[06:01.380 --> 06:04.800]  God, he had so much to look at.
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.140]  So much to see.
[06:08.060 --> 06:10.340]  I love all these MLG banners.
[06:10.680 --> 06:11.120]  Let's go.
[06:11.860 --> 06:12.820]  Product of its time.
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.460]  Do you guys ever drink fresh soda?
[06:16.800 --> 06:17.640]  Fresh A soda?
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.440]  All the time.
[06:19.440 --> 06:20.960]  Oh shit, we can repel.
[06:21.460 --> 06:22.620]  Oh, what else do they have?
[06:23.080 --> 06:23.940]  Oh, I'm dead.
[06:24.980 --> 06:26.220]  Where was I? I didn't even see you.
[06:26.520 --> 06:27.920]  I turned the corner and I got melted.
[06:28.500 --> 06:29.140]  I'm going down!
[06:29.880 --> 06:30.540]  Andrew, be careful.
[06:30.880 --> 06:32.620]  Remember to flip upside down on the rope.
[06:33.940 --> 06:34.920]  Is there a sprint?
[06:35.460 --> 06:37.520]  Guys, don't worry, there's Comcast high speed.
[06:37.740 --> 06:39.140]  Ah! They want the Comcast!
[06:40.240 --> 06:41.000]  Oh shit, I'm back.
[06:42.840 --> 06:44.380]  Alright, we should stick together.
[06:45.000 --> 06:45.700]  Ah, shit!
[06:46.020 --> 06:46.760]  It was just me, sorry.
[06:47.620 --> 06:49.200]  Ah! I'm getting shot at.
[06:49.520 --> 06:50.460]  I'm getting shot at with bullets.
[06:51.640 --> 06:53.220]  Oh, the B-Bunch Grenade!
[06:53.360 --> 06:54.000]  The B-Bunch Grenade!
[06:56.120 --> 06:58.680]  I'm trying to figure out how to fucking take cover.
[06:58.840 --> 06:59.560]  I'm hitting all the buttons.
[07:00.940 --> 07:02.280]  I spawned into that.
[07:03.080 --> 07:04.500]  Ray, that happened to me in 2012.
[07:04.800 --> 07:05.380]  I know how it feels.
[07:05.900 --> 07:08.040]  13 years later and all the turntables.
[07:09.960 --> 07:10.980]  I missed it, what happened?
[07:12.260 --> 07:15.720]  Ray got me back after a decade and a half.
[07:17.200 --> 07:18.320]  I avenge your death, Ray.
[07:18.920 --> 07:20.720]  Hey, thank you. Left bumper is sprint, by the way.
[07:26.330 --> 07:27.470]  I hear feet.
[07:28.070 --> 07:28.570]  Who's with me?
[07:29.330 --> 07:30.790]  Look at controls here.
[07:31.510 --> 07:32.430]  Is it my feet?
[07:33.710 --> 07:34.650]  Am I hearing me?
[07:35.790 --> 07:36.870]  Are you hearing your own legs?
[07:37.130 --> 07:38.310]  I think I'm hearing my own legs.
[07:38.910 --> 07:39.430]  Nice, Geoff.
[07:42.250 --> 07:43.230]  I'm out permanently.
[07:43.830 --> 07:44.450]  Where are they?
[07:46.190 --> 07:47.550]  Got you now, bitch.
[07:47.670 --> 07:48.630]  Don't go that way.
[07:48.810 --> 07:49.470]  That's aggressive.
[07:51.530 --> 07:53.350]  Lock in, Geoff. You just need 32 more people.
[07:54.130 --> 07:54.330]  Alright.
[07:58.370 --> 07:59.550]  I guess I got this.
[08:01.170 --> 08:02.170]  Where is anybody?
[08:07.490 --> 08:08.870]  I'm just trying to find someone.
[08:09.370 --> 08:09.870]  Geoff's out.
[08:11.570 --> 08:12.210]  Who's left?
[08:12.830 --> 08:13.450]  Calm down.
[08:13.450 --> 08:15.130]  He's concerned. That's scary.
[08:15.790 --> 08:16.570]  Four eyes.
[08:17.370 --> 08:18.170]  Who are they shooting at?
[08:20.070 --> 08:20.990]  40-40 vision.
[08:21.510 --> 08:23.790]  Andrew, I got almost all of them. There's only 31 left.
[08:24.170 --> 08:25.230]  40-40 vision.
[08:26.490 --> 08:26.890]  Here we go.
[08:29.190 --> 08:30.650]  We definitely did this one before.
[08:31.010 --> 08:31.210]  Did we?
[08:31.570 --> 08:35.270]  We played this a lot. I don't know how many we beat.
[08:39.110 --> 08:41.590]  We don't negotiate with slow.
[08:44.810 --> 08:45.290]  Careful.
[08:45.630 --> 08:46.030]  No!
[08:46.770 --> 08:47.890]  It was the opposite.
[08:48.290 --> 08:49.370]  We got it under 30.
[08:49.730 --> 08:50.350]  That's not bad.
[08:52.070 --> 08:53.150]  Getting the rust off.
[08:54.070 --> 08:55.730]  Ray with the one kill.
[08:55.930 --> 08:57.350]  I got two if you count a teammate.
[08:57.850 --> 08:58.750]  I'm going to go for...
[09:00.310 --> 09:02.190]  I'm going to go for a shotgun, I think.
[09:02.590 --> 09:03.750]  I had a moment where
[09:04.250 --> 09:06.790]  I accidentally turned my NVGs on
[09:06.790 --> 09:08.550]  right as four guys approached me
[09:08.550 --> 09:10.030]  and I couldn't figure out how to turn them off
[09:10.030 --> 09:11.130]  and I needed to reload
[09:11.130 --> 09:14.230]  so I just threw grenades and ran around in a circle.
[09:14.770 --> 09:15.670]  And they all died.
[09:15.710 --> 09:16.130]  And it worked.
[09:16.450 --> 09:18.370]  Is everyone ready?
[09:19.970 --> 09:21.550]  Do you want to do a different map, Geoff?
[09:21.570 --> 09:22.990]  No, we've got to beat this one.
[09:24.470 --> 09:26.250]  We're going to do a different map after we beat this.
[09:26.310 --> 09:27.290]  We're going to do every map.
[09:27.410 --> 09:29.230]  This is a new 20-part series we're doing with Ray.
[09:29.350 --> 09:30.210]  How do I breach this door?
[09:31.930 --> 09:32.150]  Shit.
[09:32.690 --> 09:36.190]  You need to equip that reaching charge.
[09:36.810 --> 09:37.170]  Grenade!
[09:37.830 --> 09:38.770]  Is that going to kill me?
[09:39.930 --> 09:41.350]  I think you killed somebody.
[09:44.830 --> 09:47.130]  Okay, the shotgun sucks.
[09:47.210 --> 09:48.550]  I'm not using this. Fuck this.
[09:49.150 --> 09:49.870]  You don't like the shotty?
[09:50.270 --> 09:52.530]  No, I took like six shots to get him.
[09:52.950 --> 09:54.430]  Where did you come from?
[09:55.050 --> 09:55.610]  Another one.
[09:57.390 --> 09:58.250]  Got that guy.
[09:58.870 --> 10:00.210]  I think I got the two dudes in there.
[10:00.610 --> 10:02.350]  There was two dudes in there.
[10:02.350 --> 10:02.650]  Another one.
[10:06.250 --> 10:06.970]  He's down.
[10:11.120 --> 10:11.480]  Reloading.
[10:14.440 --> 10:14.700]  Okay.
[10:16.140 --> 10:16.940]  Over here by me.
[10:18.140 --> 10:18.500]  Nice.
[10:20.560 --> 10:21.280]  Good comms.
[10:24.580 --> 10:25.740]  Alright, Geoff, throw a grenade.
[10:26.580 --> 10:27.120]  Alright, go for it.
[10:27.300 --> 10:30.640]  I don't know if there's anyone over there, but...
[10:30.640 --> 10:31.360]  No, nothing.
[10:31.360 --> 10:33.060]  Yeah, but you let him know.
[10:33.240 --> 10:34.320]  I did. We're coming.
[10:34.860 --> 10:36.680]  Oh, this game is...
[10:36.680 --> 10:38.080]  Did you call this Milky?
[10:38.480 --> 10:40.660]  It's Milky. It's very Milky.
[10:40.760 --> 10:42.260]  It's like Frametary and Milky.
[10:42.500 --> 10:44.840]  Yeah, this is very late 2000s.
[10:45.540 --> 10:46.740]  A dude just ran by me.
[10:47.680 --> 10:48.300]  He's dead.
[10:49.480 --> 10:49.800]  Nice.
[10:50.540 --> 10:52.020]  Watch behind us.
[10:54.920 --> 10:56.320]  Oh, there he is.
[10:57.520 --> 10:57.920]  He threw a grenade.
[10:58.540 --> 11:00.180]  Run, run, run.
[11:06.590 --> 11:07.390]  Opening door.
[11:07.770 --> 11:09.370]  I think he's repelling. Are we repelling?
[11:09.810 --> 11:10.690]  Oh no, that's them repelling.
[11:11.450 --> 11:11.690]  Alright.
[11:14.430 --> 11:16.350]  Oh, we got a lot of people through the door.
[11:17.090 --> 11:17.630]  Ah, shit.
[11:17.930 --> 11:18.410]  I'm pinned down.
[11:19.830 --> 11:20.670]  Alright, I'm behind you, Geoff.
[11:21.270 --> 11:21.770]  How's it looking?
[11:23.570 --> 11:24.710]  It's clear right now.
[11:25.910 --> 11:26.410]  I'm gonna move up.
[11:26.410 --> 11:27.630]  God, I'm dying.
[11:27.630 --> 11:29.050]  Moving up into the MLG room.
[11:29.470 --> 11:31.210]  It's a horrible big open room.
[11:31.610 --> 11:33.410]  I put six...
[11:33.410 --> 11:35.690]  I shot six pints of blood out of this guy.
[11:35.810 --> 11:36.970]  It's on the wall. There he is.
[11:37.050 --> 11:37.950]  Finally. Jesus.
[11:39.450 --> 11:40.930]  You talking about extra blood, Barry?
[11:41.470 --> 11:41.770]  Yeah.
[11:42.190 --> 11:43.430]  Oh, shit.
[11:46.590 --> 11:47.690]  To your left, Gavin.
[11:47.750 --> 11:48.130]  There's two more.
[11:54.130 --> 11:54.430]  Oh!
[11:56.410 --> 11:57.150]  Jump scare.
[12:00.450 --> 12:01.150]  I need help.
[12:01.770 --> 12:02.450]  Oh, you got two.
[12:02.550 --> 12:04.730]  I spawned right here. What the fuck?
[12:07.250 --> 12:07.990]  How'd I live?
[12:08.650 --> 12:09.670]  Alright, we're down to...
[12:09.670 --> 12:10.610]  Yeah, I got one.
[12:10.690 --> 12:11.430]  Down to 24.
[12:11.710 --> 12:14.250]  Alright, this room sucks.
[12:14.770 --> 12:16.050]  Yeah, we should get the hell out of here.
[12:18.410 --> 12:18.690]  Oh!
[12:19.330 --> 12:19.630]  Oh!
[12:22.330 --> 12:22.630]  Oh!
[12:23.110 --> 12:23.810]  Sorry, Geoff, that was me.
[12:26.310 --> 12:26.970]  There's a dude over here.
[12:27.650 --> 12:28.550]  Alright, I'm in the locker room.
[12:28.550 --> 12:30.390]  There was a dude over there. He's dead now.
[12:31.310 --> 12:32.750]  Is anyone nearby? We're doing great.
[12:33.910 --> 12:34.890]  I sent him to meet God.
[12:35.830 --> 12:36.430]  I got a guy on me.
[12:36.430 --> 12:38.390]  Ah! I got that!
[12:40.330 --> 12:41.090]  Did I get behind me?
[12:43.790 --> 12:44.510]  Yes, there sure is.
[12:44.570 --> 12:46.090]  I hope that's not you, Andrew, because I just threw a grenade.
[12:46.110 --> 12:47.570]  No, I'm on the left.
[12:49.530 --> 12:50.530]  I don't see anyone.
[12:50.570 --> 12:51.810]  Oh my God, Ray, you're backing into him.
[12:52.230 --> 12:54.070]  Oh my God, the whole...
[12:54.070 --> 12:55.190]  They're in the MLG room.
[12:55.830 --> 12:57.030]  We found the MLG squad.
[12:59.370 --> 13:00.850]  I think we've all died once.
[13:02.110 --> 13:02.710]  Oh shit.
[13:02.950 --> 13:05.370]  This is a pretty good run.
[13:05.790 --> 13:06.370]  This is the run.
[13:07.750 --> 13:10.230]  I'm out, but the rest of you guys are still in.
[13:10.570 --> 13:11.790]  Andrew, there's someone in the main room there.
[13:11.990 --> 13:13.170]  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out where they are.
[13:13.510 --> 13:14.690]  Left or right, do you see them?
[13:16.010 --> 13:17.430]  They were to the left.
[13:19.830 --> 13:21.090]  I don't see shit.
[13:21.090 --> 13:22.670]  I hear someone rappelling.
[13:22.770 --> 13:23.550]  I hear rope.
[13:27.320 --> 13:28.480]  Andrew, behind us.
[13:28.860 --> 13:29.040]  Behind.
[13:32.930 --> 13:33.830]  To your left.
[13:36.210 --> 13:37.610]  There were two there.
[13:37.970 --> 13:39.110]  Andrew, I think they're coming behind you.
[13:39.290 --> 13:41.950]  I got one.
[13:42.070 --> 13:42.550]  Sixteen.
[13:43.970 --> 13:45.410]  Shotgun is a piece of shit.
[13:45.570 --> 13:46.190]  Yeah, it's not great.
[13:47.310 --> 13:48.170]  Andrew might have been right.
[13:49.090 --> 13:50.070]  Oh, it's terrible.
[13:50.690 --> 13:52.630]  Am I the last one alive?
[13:52.830 --> 13:53.150]  Yeah, you are.
[13:53.530 --> 13:56.210]  A quick sixteen.
[13:58.530 --> 14:02.710]  Alright, that is so much better.
[14:02.810 --> 14:03.990]  We went from thirty to sixteen.
[14:05.510 --> 14:06.390]  Small improvements.
[14:07.050 --> 14:08.310]  Getting the shotgun out of my inventory.
[14:08.730 --> 14:10.590]  Except everybody got a little bit better.
[14:11.710 --> 14:13.450]  Find a breach charge if you want it.
[14:14.230 --> 14:14.630]  I'll go in.
[14:15.470 --> 14:15.830]  Oh great.
[14:17.170 --> 14:18.050]  It's awesome.
[14:18.050 --> 14:20.070]  Alright, I'm gonna...
[14:20.070 --> 14:21.550]  Alright guys, let me go first.
[14:22.010 --> 14:22.250]  Okay.
[14:24.470 --> 14:25.350]  How do you...
[14:25.350 --> 14:25.890]  Nevermind, I know.
[14:27.710 --> 14:28.710]  Oh, with the shield.
[14:29.130 --> 14:29.350]  Yeah.
[14:32.070 --> 14:32.530]  Front.
[14:33.030 --> 14:33.490]  Nice.
[14:36.050 --> 14:36.210]  Okay.
[14:37.870 --> 14:38.330]  Oh.
[14:39.090 --> 14:39.550]  Oh.
[14:44.360 --> 14:45.140]  In front of me.
[14:49.870 --> 14:51.250]  Oh, no. Why'd my shield go down?
[14:51.250 --> 14:51.850]  Controller, please.
[14:53.050 --> 14:54.050]  I gotta reload.
[14:55.410 --> 14:56.010]  Forty.
[14:59.410 --> 15:00.850]  Nice shield, Ray.
[15:01.870 --> 15:02.470]  Oh!
[15:03.290 --> 15:03.950]  Right to the left.
[15:04.970 --> 15:05.810]  Oh, shit.
[15:06.710 --> 15:08.930]  To the right!
[15:09.250 --> 15:09.810]  To the right!
[15:12.630 --> 15:13.750]  Oh, that's not good.
[15:15.810 --> 15:16.090]  Ah!
[15:16.530 --> 15:18.370]  That was a fake run.
[15:18.370 --> 15:18.690]  Fake run.
[15:19.650 --> 15:21.750]  So you can't respawn if everyone's dead.
[15:22.310 --> 15:22.970]  I forgot about that.
[15:23.850 --> 15:24.510]  Alright, we're back.
[15:24.650 --> 15:27.070]  For real, though.
[15:28.410 --> 15:28.970]  Serious run.
[15:33.350 --> 15:34.210]  Alright, guy in front.
[15:36.810 --> 15:36.990]  Okay.
[15:40.150 --> 15:41.330]  Peeping this left side.
[15:42.750 --> 15:43.350]  Oh, shit.
[15:43.470 --> 15:45.150]  Going behind you, Gavin. I'm gonna cover the right.
[15:46.670 --> 15:47.530]  Getting some bips.
[15:48.230 --> 15:48.650]  Oh.
[15:49.450 --> 15:51.030]  Guy in the far back of this room.
[15:52.450 --> 15:53.710]  I got the right flank.
[15:59.220 --> 15:59.640]  Uh...
[15:59.640 --> 16:01.820]  Bipping a guy behind the reception desk, or whatever.
[16:02.140 --> 16:02.420]  Alright.
[16:03.120 --> 16:04.200]  I got blood in a tree.
[16:06.540 --> 16:07.420]  Slowly moving up.
[16:07.500 --> 16:09.400]  Oh! Guy behind the...
[16:09.400 --> 16:09.700]  Got him.
[16:10.240 --> 16:16.460]  Okay, got one more guy on the right side.
[16:16.500 --> 16:16.880]  I'm getting him.
[16:18.800 --> 16:20.640]  I'm slowly turning this corner to the right.
[16:20.640 --> 16:21.540]  I'm with you, right?
[16:23.140 --> 16:25.220]  Oh, that's got prime breach charge
[16:25.220 --> 16:25.980]  written all over it.
[16:26.320 --> 16:27.660]  Check this shit out.
[16:31.020 --> 16:32.320]  How do you do it?
[16:32.580 --> 16:33.380]  Oh, here we go.
[16:34.560 --> 16:35.320]  Can I put one on each?
[16:37.000 --> 16:37.600]  Oh, God!
[16:39.500 --> 16:40.540]  You know, I'm starting to learn
[16:40.540 --> 16:41.560]  how it happened 12 years ago.
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.720]  My guy's just pressing buttons.
[16:49.380 --> 16:50.680]  I hear someone on the left!
[16:51.580 --> 16:52.500]  Yep, he's on the left.
[17:00.800 --> 17:01.240]  Ah!
[17:02.780 --> 17:04.340]  Where the fuck is he?
[17:04.740 --> 17:05.320]  Oh, God!
[17:06.940 --> 17:07.380]  Jesus!
[17:08.460 --> 17:08.840]  Alright, I'm back.
[17:12.200 --> 17:13.080]  Bad room.
[17:13.620 --> 17:14.540]  That's a real bad room.
[17:15.080 --> 17:15.820]  Yeah, this is a big open...
[17:15.820 --> 17:17.660]  Not a good room.
[17:20.500 --> 17:20.940]  Grenade!
[17:21.160 --> 17:21.480]  Grenade!
[17:21.600 --> 17:23.440]  Did you both throw a grenade?
[17:25.060 --> 17:27.220]  Just Geoff, I think.
[17:27.860 --> 17:30.560]  God, it really does look like I tattooed my glasses on my face.
[17:31.300 --> 17:32.100]  Jesus Christ.
[17:37.560 --> 17:39.720]  I think this MLG room might be clear.
[17:39.880 --> 17:41.040]  Nope, nope, not clear.
[17:46.350 --> 17:47.990]  Alright, I got someone else in the MLG room.
[17:49.330 --> 17:50.570]  Oh, wait, that's...
[17:50.570 --> 17:52.030]  Geoff, I'm someone else.
[17:53.350 --> 17:53.810]  Gavin.
[17:55.150 --> 17:56.350]  Alright, another door.
[17:57.650 --> 17:58.290]  You gonna breach it?
[17:58.290 --> 17:59.550]  Yeah, check this out.
[18:02.950 --> 18:04.050]  Let's get behind cover.
[18:04.490 --> 18:05.690]  Just hold left trigger.
[18:06.430 --> 18:07.930]  Alright, here we go.
[18:09.850 --> 18:09.970]  Oh!
[18:10.470 --> 18:11.610]  The door hit me in the face!
[18:11.730 --> 18:14.450]  It did slam right in your face, but it did look cool.
[18:15.570 --> 18:16.610]  I'm grouping up on you guys.
[18:17.170 --> 18:17.250]  Yep.
[18:20.170 --> 18:20.290]  Oh!
[18:20.690 --> 18:21.090]  What?
[18:21.870 --> 18:23.010]  Someone from the right got me.
[18:24.070 --> 18:24.330]  Careful.
[18:24.650 --> 18:25.550]  In the room with us?
[18:25.930 --> 18:26.250]  I don't know.
[18:27.730 --> 18:28.370]  Behind us.
[18:28.870 --> 18:30.390]  I got two with a grenade, but I'm down.
[18:32.930 --> 18:33.650]  One more coming.
[18:34.290 --> 18:34.550]  Two more.
[18:36.970 --> 18:37.290]  Nice.
[18:40.430 --> 18:41.230]  One more behind.
[18:41.790 --> 18:43.110]  Oh shit, there's another one far back.
[18:43.210 --> 18:44.110]  Oh, it's Andrew, not Geoff, sorry.
[18:45.950 --> 18:47.670]  You can tell it's not me because they're alive.
[18:49.050 --> 18:49.370]  Behind!
[18:49.930 --> 18:50.770]  Behind, behind, behind.
[18:51.450 --> 18:52.050]  Ah!
[18:52.690 --> 18:53.290]  Fuck!
[18:54.110 --> 18:55.510]  This is tough.
[18:56.430 --> 18:57.610]  We're getting there now.
[18:58.070 --> 18:59.690]  We are getting there.
[19:00.490 --> 19:01.190]  I'm just ready to go.
[19:01.950 --> 19:04.410]  I was in the MLG room, I could feel it in my veins.
[19:05.450 --> 19:06.590]  Feeling inspired?
[19:07.150 --> 19:07.530]  Yeah!
[19:08.490 --> 19:10.730]  Andrew had all four eyes on the target.
[19:10.930 --> 19:12.230]  All four eyes.
[19:12.590 --> 19:14.650]  Gamer fuel running through my veins.
[19:15.810 --> 19:16.650]  I'm going to switch to
[19:16.650 --> 19:17.790]  incendiary.
[19:19.370 --> 19:19.690]  Tuego.
[19:22.490 --> 19:23.510]  Guys, I don't know Spanish.
[19:27.210 --> 19:29.530]  I remember Ray being funny, but you're not too bad.
[19:30.450 --> 19:30.950]  Thanks, man.
[19:32.370 --> 19:33.490]  Like I said, I bring the comedy.
[19:34.110 --> 19:35.530]  I think you responded, where do you bring it?
[19:36.510 --> 19:37.010]  Don't worry.
[19:37.710 --> 19:38.590]  Would you bring it here, please?
[19:39.070 --> 19:41.710]  You got assassinated, Gavin.
[19:41.970 --> 19:42.950]  That was like an execution.
[19:43.690 --> 19:44.670]  That was point blank.
[19:45.990 --> 19:47.130]  Are you going to push on the right again?
[19:47.130 --> 19:47.750]  There's a bunch.
[19:48.050 --> 19:48.390]  Oh no!
[19:49.990 --> 19:52.310]  I went upstairs to try and go a different way.
[19:52.410 --> 19:53.670]  Maybe I should have stuck with you guys.
[19:54.230 --> 19:55.270]  It put me in front.
[20:01.700 --> 20:01.960]  Fuck.
[20:05.760 --> 20:06.900]  This might not be the round.
[20:08.720 --> 20:09.120]  Shit.
[20:10.180 --> 20:11.840]  I'm starting to remember the frustration.
[20:12.940 --> 20:13.340]  Yeah.
[20:13.880 --> 20:14.520]  Are you still upstairs?
[20:15.380 --> 20:16.400]  I'm still upstairs, yeah.
[20:16.400 --> 20:18.860]  I killed two guys up here, but...
[20:18.860 --> 20:19.220]  Oh, I see.
[20:26.540 --> 20:27.400]  That's not us.
[20:28.180 --> 20:28.720]  Upper store.
[20:33.640 --> 20:34.240]  That's us.
[20:35.660 --> 20:36.700]  He went down that rappel.
[20:38.120 --> 20:38.780]  Behind you!
[20:40.120 --> 20:40.780]  Goddamn, dude.
[20:43.340 --> 20:47.120]  I think you got two of them.
[20:47.120 --> 20:48.100]  Oh, nice.
[20:52.960 --> 20:53.960]  Oh, another one.
[20:54.740 --> 20:55.220]  Got him.
[20:57.100 --> 20:58.120]  Did he come up the rope?
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.440]  He did come up the rope.
[20:59.800 --> 21:02.500]  I'm just going to stand at the top of this rope and shoot him in the ass.
[21:04.260 --> 21:04.800]  I got him.
[21:05.640 --> 21:06.140]  Andrew, no!
[21:06.740 --> 21:07.780]  That was bad.
[21:10.240 --> 21:10.640]  No!
[21:13.040 --> 21:13.440]  Goddamn.
[21:17.550 --> 21:18.270]  Oh, shit.
[21:18.370 --> 21:19.410]  I want to beat this.
[21:20.010 --> 21:20.570]  We will.
[21:21.270 --> 21:22.290]  How many levels are in this?
[21:22.450 --> 21:23.730]  How many fucking videos are we going to make?
[21:25.070 --> 21:25.790]  Oh, Ray.
[21:27.990 --> 21:28.710]  Good try.
[21:29.290 --> 21:29.790]  Thanks, man.
[21:30.350 --> 21:33.130]  Alright, this is the one before we do it.
[21:33.270 --> 21:34.330]  Okay, gotcha.
[21:35.190 --> 21:36.150]  You got to build the tension.
[21:36.650 --> 21:38.310]  You got to fail a little bit to build suspense.
[21:38.550 --> 21:39.350]  Maybe a short video.
[21:40.650 --> 21:43.290]  I like upstairs a lot better because there's no giant rooms.
[21:44.230 --> 21:44.910]  Oh, my God.
[21:44.990 --> 21:46.170]  The kick on this is crazy.
[21:47.670 --> 21:48.250]  Got him.
[21:49.410 --> 21:51.670]  In what game is A open a door?
[21:53.570 --> 21:55.170]  The controls in this are asinine.
[21:56.030 --> 21:57.490]  Left bumper to sprint.
[21:57.730 --> 21:59.110]  Like, who hurt you?
[22:06.240 --> 22:06.780]  Oh, yeah.
[22:06.780 --> 22:09.140]  We got some guys here in this open room.
[22:10.760 --> 22:11.100]  Grenade out.
[22:11.760 --> 22:12.740]  To the right.
[22:13.740 --> 22:15.660]  I'm going to cross and then I'm going to cover the right.
[22:16.480 --> 22:17.880]  He's running away after he got you.
[22:17.880 --> 22:18.820]  Okay, I'm going to hold right.
[22:19.720 --> 22:20.080]  Coward.
[22:22.280 --> 22:22.640]  Alright, I'm back.
[22:33.100 --> 22:34.120]  Can I get this guy in the corner?
[22:34.640 --> 22:35.860]  Alright, that guy in the corner is dead, Andrew.
[22:36.700 --> 22:37.520]  Awesome, thank you.
[22:39.620 --> 22:40.420]  Okay, pushing up.
[22:42.020 --> 22:42.100]  Oh!
[22:43.600 --> 22:45.020]  He just turned that corner.
[22:45.140 --> 22:45.600]  That's bullshit.
[22:48.520 --> 22:50.060]  We'll be back in seven.
[22:51.640 --> 22:53.720]  Don't forget they're going to come around behind us at some point.
[22:54.120 --> 22:55.140]  Sneaky little fuckers.
[22:57.020 --> 22:58.240]  I'm going to push forward.
[22:58.580 --> 22:59.920]  Yeah, that's good.
[23:04.720 --> 23:05.560]  That's a shotgun.
[23:05.720 --> 23:06.580]  Oh, they're in the big room.
[23:06.960 --> 23:08.700]  There was somebody there.
[23:08.940 --> 23:09.080]  Fuck.
[23:13.080 --> 23:14.400]  You died so quick.
[23:14.460 --> 23:14.900]  Oh, behind you.
[23:16.320 --> 23:16.640]  Oh, no.
[23:17.740 --> 23:18.520]  Oh, you buddy.
[23:20.640 --> 23:21.900]  I'm coming back.
[23:24.300 --> 23:24.940]  I'm back.
[23:27.240 --> 23:27.720]  Careful.
[23:29.740 --> 23:30.380]  Behind you.
[23:30.680 --> 23:31.340]  Through the door.
[23:31.360 --> 23:31.820]  Yeah, behind me.
[23:34.040 --> 23:35.180]  They're shooting this way.
[23:36.340 --> 23:37.460]  There's so many of them.
[23:37.620 --> 23:38.460]  He's right around that corner.
[23:38.580 --> 23:39.200]  Oh, God.
[23:42.080 --> 23:43.240]  How did you die?
[23:43.380 --> 23:43.840]  You're by the wall.
[23:45.700 --> 23:48.600]  Alright, well that wasn't it.
[23:48.740 --> 23:49.580]  Just like Gavin said.
[23:49.960 --> 23:52.480]  That was an awful room.
[23:52.680 --> 23:54.080]  It seemed to be a good start
[23:54.080 --> 23:56.920]  when we had a right flank cover
[23:56.920 --> 23:59.060]  and then clearing out this main room.
[23:59.560 --> 24:00.220]  Why don't we all go up?
[24:01.340 --> 24:02.520]  You think going up is the move?
[24:02.720 --> 24:03.600]  Let's try it.
[24:03.700 --> 24:05.000]  Get the high ground.
[24:05.420 --> 24:05.560]  Sorry.
[24:08.180 --> 24:08.240]  Alright.
[24:12.200 --> 24:13.060]  I'll do it.
[24:13.420 --> 24:13.640]  Okay.
[24:14.060 --> 24:14.920]  I'm just going to use the handle.
[24:17.640 --> 24:17.820]  Oops.
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.500]  I'm going to go straight or right.
[24:22.220 --> 24:23.080]  I'm not seeing anybody.
[24:24.740 --> 24:26.100]  I'm looking to the right.
[24:26.100 --> 24:26.900]  I don't see anyone.
[24:28.840 --> 24:28.940]  Okay.
[24:29.640 --> 24:30.580]  Watch behind us.
[24:31.580 --> 24:33.000]  Sprint his left bumper.
[24:33.380 --> 24:33.900]  It's so weird.
[24:36.620 --> 24:37.800]  Got a guy right here.
[24:37.880 --> 24:38.440]  Oh, shit!
[24:40.440 --> 24:40.920]  Nice.
[24:43.440 --> 24:44.520]  One on the left.
[24:45.980 --> 24:47.040]  They're watching behind us.
[24:47.920 --> 24:49.140]  Oh, I'm going to get stumped.
[24:49.260 --> 24:51.460]  I'm coming to help.
[24:54.570 --> 24:55.490]  Oh, jeez.
[25:03.830 --> 25:04.810]  I'm going across.
[25:05.410 --> 25:05.810]  Nope.
[25:08.530 --> 25:09.570]  Person on the right.
[25:10.310 --> 25:10.850]  Where was that?
[25:11.510 --> 25:12.730]  I think Andrew went on the left side.
[25:13.290 --> 25:14.310]  Oh, bastard.
[25:18.450 --> 25:18.730]  Oh, no.
[25:19.410 --> 25:20.210]  Oh, Geoff.
[25:21.990 --> 25:22.970]  Is there melee?
[25:24.310 --> 25:25.450]  Geoff was going to call the duty
[25:25.450 --> 25:26.290]  panic knife here.
[25:27.190 --> 25:28.970]  I was in the middle of reloading.
[25:29.110 --> 25:29.490]  I got you.
[25:29.670 --> 25:33.170]  The last thing he heard was a guy yelling,
[25:33.170 --> 25:34.030]  Is there melee?
[25:39.920 --> 25:42.120]  Oh, shit.
[25:42.180 --> 25:42.800]  Was that down there?
[25:44.700 --> 25:46.140]  I'm going to get a grenade in that room.
[25:46.280 --> 25:46.460]  Yep.
[25:47.140 --> 25:47.760]  Oh, no.
[25:55.600 --> 25:57.460]  It was so clear that you just
[25:57.460 --> 25:58.960]  put your head in front of my hand.
[26:01.240 --> 26:01.800]  Oh, shit.
[26:01.800 --> 26:02.160]  Oh, around this corner.
[26:04.700 --> 26:06.400]  Oh, there's another one, you son of a bitch.
[26:07.940 --> 26:08.380]  Got him.
[26:09.200 --> 26:09.700]  Watch out, Geoff.
[26:09.860 --> 26:10.800]  Oh, Geoff.
[26:17.500 --> 26:18.280]  I'd let him know.
[26:20.200 --> 26:21.140]  I'm going to get another grenade up there.
[26:22.920 --> 26:23.280]  Alright.
[26:23.700 --> 26:25.060]  I got the guy that got our guys.
[26:25.840 --> 26:26.200]  Nice.
[26:28.120 --> 26:29.120]  How does this work?
[26:31.060 --> 26:31.960]  Oh, there you go.
[26:32.100 --> 26:32.600]  Oh, shit.
[26:32.660 --> 26:33.680]  You go upside down in this game?
[26:34.580 --> 26:35.580]  Are you rappelling?
[26:36.060 --> 26:37.160]  Yeah, I'm just looking at a wall.
[26:37.340 --> 26:38.380]  Let me come back up and help.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.460]  Alright, we're upstairs in the MLG room.
[26:42.520 --> 26:43.300]  Surely that'll be better.
[26:44.840 --> 26:45.460]  Oh, no. There's a guy.
[26:45.620 --> 26:47.720]  I think he just went down.
[26:48.840 --> 26:49.820]  Down, down, down.
[26:59.090 --> 26:59.350]  Oh.
[27:00.130 --> 27:00.850]  Good shot.
[27:02.370 --> 27:02.690]  Nice.
[27:02.690 --> 27:03.770]  There's another one over here.
[27:04.930 --> 27:06.050]  There's a guy across the way.
[27:06.210 --> 27:07.210]  There's still some over here.
[27:09.030 --> 27:09.390]  Nice.
[27:10.530 --> 27:11.590]  Oh, another guy rappelling.
[27:13.910 --> 27:15.730]  That's not great aim, but we'll take it.
[27:17.950 --> 27:18.510]  Ranked up.
[27:19.270 --> 27:19.650]  Let's go.
[27:20.710 --> 27:22.730]  Soon you can be level 8 prestige, whatever the hell I am.
[27:23.310 --> 27:24.050]  Oh, that's not us.
[27:25.930 --> 27:26.750]  There's just two guys
[27:26.750 --> 27:28.210]  with their backs to us.
[27:30.610 --> 27:30.970]  Shotgunned.
[27:31.530 --> 27:32.010]  Dang.
[27:37.500 --> 27:39.660]  Oh, I saw a guy rappel over there.
[27:40.300 --> 27:41.180]  I'm gonna move up
[27:41.180 --> 27:43.000]  and get shot right now as this game goes.
[27:43.200 --> 27:43.540]  Oh!
[27:46.660 --> 27:47.620]  Nice recovery.
[27:48.340 --> 27:49.120]  I need to reload,
[27:49.220 --> 27:49.840]  but I'm scared to.
[27:50.960 --> 27:51.940]  Oh, Geoff, is that you with me?
[27:52.120 --> 27:53.240]  I'm with me.
[27:53.420 --> 27:55.800]  I'm reloading.
[27:57.100 --> 27:57.580]  Oh!
[27:59.060 --> 28:00.260]  What was that?
[28:00.640 --> 28:02.200]  That didn't sound great.
[28:02.200 --> 28:03.920]  They found the good shotgun.
[28:04.440 --> 28:05.000]  Oh!
[28:19.420 --> 28:21.100]  Only 21 guys, huh?
[28:22.180 --> 28:23.160]  You got it.
[28:23.680 --> 28:25.480]  Hey, raise
[28:25.480 --> 28:27.320]  MLG prestige
[28:27.320 --> 28:28.140]  level 9.
[28:29.540 --> 28:30.240]  It's my brain age.
[28:30.640 --> 28:31.620]  Probably unlocked a new character.
[28:32.300 --> 28:33.180]  Brain age.
[28:36.380 --> 28:36.740]  That guy.
[28:38.980 --> 28:40.040]  Oh my god!
[28:40.040 --> 28:42.120]  Holy shit, there was three of them.
[28:42.180 --> 28:43.760]  Back a little bit.
[28:45.380 --> 28:48.460]  The grenade throw is such a placeholder animation.
[28:48.800 --> 28:50.540]  It's so slow.
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.160]  I don't know how to change my grenade.
[28:53.500 --> 28:54.040]  That's a problem.
[28:57.670 --> 28:58.070]  Oh!
[28:59.650 --> 29:00.610]  Three of them!
[29:04.410 --> 29:05.730]  That's on a wall for cover.
[29:08.130 --> 29:08.730]  17.
[29:08.730 --> 29:08.930]  17.
[29:09.290 --> 29:11.410]  I think we're tied for as good as we've done.
[29:17.240 --> 29:17.640]  Oh!
[29:20.340 --> 29:21.460]  Oh, that is not a good aim.
[29:22.060 --> 29:23.360]  Not so bad in there.
[29:24.180 --> 29:24.500]  Oh!
[29:27.640 --> 29:30.000]  That was pretty good.
[29:30.380 --> 29:31.240]  Alright, we're gonna get it right here.
[29:31.580 --> 29:32.000]  Let's go, Gavin.
[29:34.520 --> 29:36.700]  Let me adjust my outfitting a little bit.
[29:36.860 --> 29:37.140]  Okay.
[29:37.460 --> 29:37.860]  I'm sorry.
[29:38.440 --> 29:39.080]  I'm sorry.
[29:40.260 --> 29:41.340]  Are we feeling up or down?
[29:42.100 --> 29:43.380]  We did well when we went up.
[29:43.480 --> 29:44.100]  Alright, go up.
[29:47.400 --> 29:49.220]  No fear, just run in.
[29:51.240 --> 29:52.000]  Right here on your right.
[29:56.520 --> 29:57.680]  I remember the old ones, Ray.
[29:57.760 --> 29:59.100]  You would always have like a
[29:59.880 --> 30:02.020]  color scheme, like an Iron Man or an M-Bike.
[30:02.040 --> 30:03.740]  Oh yeah, I didn't show you,
[30:03.780 --> 30:05.120]  but I showed Eric when I loaded up the game.
[30:05.160 --> 30:06.040]  I was just like a Ninja Turtle.
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.880]  I mean, you'll have the footage if you wanted to cut to it.
[30:09.880 --> 30:11.880]  Yeah, before I changed my face, I was a Ninja Turtle.
[30:12.160 --> 30:13.000]  Oh God!
[30:13.920 --> 30:15.340]  Good shots. Grenade, hold on.
[30:16.780 --> 30:17.680]  Yeah, I was Iron Man.
[30:17.780 --> 30:19.500]  I was like M-Bison from Street Fighter 1.
[30:22.320 --> 30:23.200]  Oh shit, sorry.
[30:23.600 --> 30:23.800]  Oh!
[30:26.320 --> 30:26.740]  Sorry.
[30:29.320 --> 30:30.500]  I'm so sorry.
[30:33.840 --> 30:36.160]  Guy just rappelled down to the MLG room.
[30:37.120 --> 30:37.760]  Grenade out!
[30:39.080 --> 30:39.720]  Oh shit.
[30:39.940 --> 30:41.000]  I just went with you.
[30:41.160 --> 30:43.840]  I thought it was going to be so cool.
[30:43.960 --> 30:46.200]  We were going to double nade and we threw it like 2 inches in front of us.
[30:46.780 --> 30:48.480]  We didn't even make it over the railing.
[30:48.740 --> 30:49.600]  Guy coming up, guy coming up.
[30:50.300 --> 30:50.540]  Nice.
[30:51.240 --> 30:53.800]  If you want to change your grenade, you have to hold Y to bring up
[30:53.800 --> 30:55.620]  like your other menu.
[30:56.900 --> 30:59.660]  Make sure there's nobody coming up behind us.
[31:00.480 --> 31:01.160]  This room's cool.
[31:02.740 --> 31:04.140]  Good overview back here.
[31:04.600 --> 31:05.200]  Looking good.
[31:05.200 --> 31:06.320]  I think we're clear.
[31:06.620 --> 31:07.380]  Looking real good.
[31:08.560 --> 31:10.120]  Oh, my accuracy is so ass.
[31:11.560 --> 31:12.080]  Yep.
[31:13.160 --> 31:14.720]  Where was that? Downstairs?
[31:15.000 --> 31:15.820]  That was downstairs, yeah.
[31:17.720 --> 31:19.120]  They made these stairs
[31:19.120 --> 31:20.020]  look like an escalator.
[31:21.660 --> 31:22.760]  That didn't sound good.
[31:24.140 --> 31:24.600]  Oh shit.
[31:28.000 --> 31:28.520]  Free!
[31:28.920 --> 31:29.740]  That was nice.
[31:30.280 --> 31:32.300]  Oh shit, Ray, I shot your butt!
[31:32.760 --> 31:34.240]  I had iframes, you're fine.
[31:36.660 --> 31:38.200]  This guy's still alive? Hey, fuck you.
[31:38.320 --> 31:39.320]  Hold on. I just threw a grenade.
[31:41.120 --> 31:41.980]  I got him.
[31:43.560 --> 31:44.620]  I think I put about
[31:44.620 --> 31:46.380]  three rounds in your ass.
[31:46.560 --> 31:47.240]  I got your guys back.
[31:47.760 --> 31:50.620]  All right, 30 left.
[31:51.840 --> 31:52.340]  Moving up.
[31:54.980 --> 31:56.840]  You looked really cool when you spun around
[31:56.840 --> 31:57.240]  like that, Gav.
[31:57.560 --> 31:59.740]  There you go.
[32:00.700 --> 32:01.060]  Okay.
[32:06.100 --> 32:07.040]  Off the wall.
[32:07.440 --> 32:08.620]  God, that animation sucks.
[32:13.740 --> 32:14.720]  I got him.
[32:15.560 --> 32:16.720]  Oh, I gotta reload. This is awkward.
[32:17.540 --> 32:18.300]  Don't do it.
[32:19.920 --> 32:20.900]  He's still alive, I think.
[32:21.280 --> 32:22.520]  Is he hiding behind the pillar?
[32:22.820 --> 32:23.720]  You got somebody.
[32:24.880 --> 32:26.040]  I just saw a grenade.
[32:26.820 --> 32:27.260]  What was that?
[32:27.260 --> 32:28.920]  I think that was Geoff.
[32:29.180 --> 32:29.600]  That was me.
[32:30.140 --> 32:31.800]  I didn't know Geoff was here until I ran back.
[32:31.880 --> 32:33.840]  I just saw the marker for like one frame and panicked.
[32:34.220 --> 32:37.000]  Oh, I just almost shot Geoff in the back of the head.
[32:39.320 --> 32:40.780]  Who was that? Who shot me?
[32:41.800 --> 32:43.060]  Oh, it's popping off in here.
[32:43.940 --> 32:44.680]  Oh, I'm out of grenades.
[32:45.160 --> 32:46.700]  Wait, no I'm not. I'm gonna get a grenade out there.
[32:47.460 --> 32:48.860]  Grenade out! Oh no, it's a bad throw!
[32:51.900 --> 32:52.820]  Oh, what a grenade!
[32:53.620 --> 32:54.160]  Two of them are dead.
[32:54.160 --> 32:55.160]  I'm hit, good throw.
[32:57.320 --> 32:57.680]  Alright.
[33:00.840 --> 33:02.180]  It's popping off in this room.
[33:02.700 --> 33:03.440]  I got no more grenades.
[33:04.620 --> 33:04.980]  Crossing.
[33:10.830 --> 33:12.250]  Did you get the guy, Geoff, or no?
[33:12.510 --> 33:14.130]  I definitely...
[33:14.130 --> 33:15.750]  If he's not dead, he's scared.
[33:18.310 --> 33:20.530]  I see a lot of blood over there, so I'm gonna assume you got him.
[33:24.530 --> 33:25.250]  Heading around.
[33:27.230 --> 33:27.850]  There's a guy right here.
[33:29.870 --> 33:31.870]  I don't think I got him. I definitely shot around him.
[33:33.090 --> 33:33.730]  As if to say,
[33:33.910 --> 33:36.150]  eventually, if you stand still long enough.
[33:36.870 --> 33:37.930]  Oh, guy on me!
[33:38.450 --> 33:39.710]  To the right of you guys.
[33:39.890 --> 33:41.590]  I see him. I got him.
[33:42.710 --> 33:43.190]  Oh, it's me.
[33:45.330 --> 33:46.490]  Oh, 13 more.
[33:47.150 --> 33:47.490]  New record.
[33:47.630 --> 33:48.410]  We're gonna do it.
[33:50.210 --> 33:51.310]  Alright, got another one.
[33:51.670 --> 33:53.010]  We might be the best at this.
[33:53.570 --> 33:55.330]  We might be the only ones playing this.
[33:55.730 --> 33:58.310]  We might be the best that are still playing this.
[34:00.810 --> 34:02.010]  I'm back in the reception room,
[34:02.070 --> 34:02.990]  where we usually go first.
[34:03.650 --> 34:04.990]  Yeah, I'm in the MLG room.
[34:05.590 --> 34:06.770]  Oh, there's two guys. At least two.
[34:08.070 --> 34:09.810]  I didn't throw my grenade very far. Watch it.
[34:11.730 --> 34:14.070]  Oh, shit! MLG room, one guy ground floor,
[34:14.170 --> 34:15.150]  two people gonna repel.
[34:16.350 --> 34:16.610]  Alright.
[34:17.470 --> 34:18.210]  I'm out of lives.
[34:19.530 --> 34:19.910]  Oh, shit.
[34:21.370 --> 34:22.230]  Alright, down to 10.
[34:23.970 --> 34:24.610]  I'm stretched.
[34:24.610 --> 34:24.630]  I'm stretched.
[34:27.830 --> 34:29.010]  You said the MLG room, right?
[34:29.610 --> 34:30.270]  Ah! Down.
[34:30.450 --> 34:31.030]  Oh, yep.
[34:32.650 --> 34:34.030]  I think I have a life.
[34:34.490 --> 34:35.630]  Oh, yep. Hold on.
[34:36.230 --> 34:37.650]  They're coming from the MLG room as well.
[34:37.870 --> 34:40.510]  Grenade out! Down to nine. Stay alive.
[34:40.750 --> 34:41.890]  He's coming up your right, too, Ray.
[34:42.650 --> 34:44.030]  Oh, Ray! Right with us!
[34:44.670 --> 34:45.450]  Oh, shit.
[34:45.970 --> 34:49.390]  Alright, we still have a guy down the hallway.
[34:50.010 --> 34:51.010]  Oh, I threw a grenade on accident.
[34:51.250 --> 34:51.690]  Oh, God.
[34:51.690 --> 34:52.290]  Where's the grenade?
[34:53.610 --> 34:54.870]  It bounced off a wall in front of me.
[34:55.190 --> 34:55.890]  Oh, I'm dead.
[34:56.290 --> 34:58.310]  That was useless. I'm useless.
[34:58.970 --> 35:00.610]  Oh, nice, Ray.
[35:02.030 --> 35:03.190]  There's another one down this...
[35:03.950 --> 35:04.610]  Got him.
[35:05.690 --> 35:06.170]  Nice.
[35:07.210 --> 35:09.470]  That was not my finest moment.
[35:10.370 --> 35:10.830]  Four more.
[35:11.310 --> 35:11.770]  Four more.
[35:12.690 --> 35:13.850]  Two down the middle.
[35:14.550 --> 35:14.930]  Three more.
[35:16.330 --> 35:17.510]  Two v. two.
[35:17.510 --> 35:18.330]  Two v. two.
[35:19.910 --> 35:20.850]  Hold it together.
[35:21.810 --> 35:23.530]  They will come to you, I think, right?
[35:24.210 --> 35:25.770]  X-Ray and Vav versus two men.
[35:25.990 --> 35:28.250]  When it gets down to less than ten, I think they come at you.
[35:28.690 --> 35:29.770]  Yeah, I mean, they've been pushing us,
[35:29.810 --> 35:31.070]  so I just don't know where they're coming from.
[35:31.710 --> 35:32.930]  You're gonna get pushed so hard.
[35:34.990 --> 35:35.810]  Should I be bait?
[35:36.130 --> 35:36.870]  I'll be bum bait.
[35:37.130 --> 35:37.770]  Don't be bait.
[35:38.090 --> 35:39.310]  You don't have to be bait. We can lock in.
[35:43.530 --> 35:44.850]  Make sure to check corners.
[35:45.690 --> 35:46.530]  And repels and shit.
[35:49.850 --> 35:51.010]  Hey, Ray, check this out.
[35:51.310 --> 35:53.170]  Click on the left stick.
[35:53.250 --> 35:54.290]  Oh, hell yeah.
[35:54.630 --> 35:59.070]  I can be Mary Jane. We can do the kiss.
[35:59.250 --> 35:59.610]  Kiss!
[36:05.370 --> 36:06.970]  Well, at least we throw the run.
[36:07.050 --> 36:07.990]  We made some content.
[36:09.830 --> 36:13.250]  Nope, that's a plant.
[36:15.270 --> 36:17.370]  I'm gonna shit my pants. I'm so tense.
[36:21.370 --> 36:22.670]  Check behind us as well.
[36:23.690 --> 36:26.930]  Flappy strings, but I don't think anyone's on them.
[36:32.280 --> 36:34.460]  You know they're just hanging out in the control room.
[36:34.460 --> 36:36.600]  Yeah, I have a feeling they haven't moved.
[36:38.540 --> 36:39.320]  Did you take a repel?
[36:39.920 --> 36:41.300]  No, I just walked up the stairs.
[36:41.460 --> 36:42.240]  Okay, I heard a repel.
[36:44.460 --> 36:46.380]  So they're either coming up or down.
[36:50.560 --> 36:51.440]  Oh, I got one on me.
[36:52.260 --> 36:53.020]  One left.
[36:53.800 --> 36:54.800]  One left.
[36:56.380 --> 36:57.500]  We got him!
[36:59.440 --> 37:01.860]  I didn't do shit that round.
[37:02.180 --> 37:02.780]  Hell yeah.
[37:03.800 --> 37:04.180]  Congratulations.
[37:04.880 --> 37:08.160]  20, 17, 5, and 3.
[37:08.820 --> 37:10.120]  A bottle of clava would've been ice.
[37:13.120 --> 37:13.980]  I gotta go unrelated.
[37:14.060 --> 37:15.620]  I got a positive KD. Love it.
[37:16.080 --> 37:17.120]  Give us a quick outro, Geoff.
[37:17.700 --> 37:20.380]  Well, I think that'll do it for this video.
[37:20.380 --> 37:23.400]  So clearly a well-oiled machine,
[37:23.880 --> 37:25.380]  this team of mercenaries.
[37:27.220 --> 37:29.200]  In some cultures you would call us mercenaries,
[37:29.280 --> 37:30.480]  in others you'd call us proud patriots.
[37:32.180 --> 37:33.440]  I think we'll be back.
[37:33.600 --> 37:35.260]  I think we'll have to do this again sometime, right?
[37:35.400 --> 37:36.860]  I'll be honest.
[37:37.120 --> 37:38.120]  It's a dangerous world out there.
[37:38.420 --> 37:40.260]  There's a lot of terrorism, a lot of bad people,
[37:40.680 --> 37:43.600]  a lot of bad actors, as they say,
[37:43.680 --> 37:45.160]  trying to do harm in the world.
[37:45.280 --> 37:48.340]  And I don't know who else is gonna stop them,
[37:48.480 --> 37:49.340]  if not for us.
[37:49.340 --> 37:52.300]  And if those bad actors want to check out our Patreon
[37:52.300 --> 37:55.740]  at the Regulation Pod...
[37:55.740 --> 37:56.800]  You could do that, or you could go to...
[37:56.800 --> 37:57.820]  Ray, are you on the internet?
[37:58.440 --> 38:00.120]  I am, unfortunately, on the internet still.
[38:00.240 --> 38:03.560]  Twitch.tv slash Ray, if you wanna...
[38:03.560 --> 38:04.440]  watch some mediocre content.
[38:06.780 --> 38:08.980]  If you wanna watch the most successful mediocre content,
[38:09.380 --> 38:09.940]  go watch Ray.
[38:10.720 --> 38:11.380]  Please and thank you.
[38:12.140 --> 38:12.300]  Bye!
