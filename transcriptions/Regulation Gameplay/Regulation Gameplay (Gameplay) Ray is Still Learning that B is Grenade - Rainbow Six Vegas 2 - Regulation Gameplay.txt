[00:00.000 --> 00:00.760]  Alright
[00:01.600 --> 00:03.320]  Lock in boys. We got it.
[00:04.720 --> 00:11.480]  It's 2012 again, baby. Let's do it. This is the exact wall where the grenade. Oh, I remember now B is grenade
[00:11.480 --> 00:16.260]  Oh, I just had a Jimmy Neutron brain blast for that moment. It came rushing back
[00:16.920 --> 00:21.080]  Should I recreate? It's like the guy from Ratatouille. I just had that moment
[00:23.160 --> 00:26.560]  Wow, I set my back on fire a little bit. I threw a grenade at him.
[00:27.180 --> 00:32.160]  There's only 35 enemies this time. Got him. I think it depends on the map. Yeah, it's a smaller map.
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.340]  Yeah, who would have thought left
[00:38.180 --> 00:40.920]  Trigger being cover and B being right.
[00:42.400 --> 00:48.520]  There's a guy back here. I didn't know. I wonder if back then Tom Clancy himself had input into the controller schemes
[00:51.460 --> 00:55.540]  So I was thinking on this game we do left bumper for sprint
[00:58.720 --> 00:59.040]  Oh
[00:59.040 --> 01:03.220]  Behind me. I got shot from behind. Oh, man. I thought the piano. Oh, I fucked up the piano. Oh, no
[01:03.220 --> 01:05.280]  They're running running running running upstairs
[01:06.800 --> 01:07.960]  Why is that rope kicking
[01:16.560 --> 01:16.880]  Jacuzzi
[01:20.580 --> 01:21.380]  Well, let me in
[01:29.580 --> 01:30.060]  I
[01:30.920 --> 01:31.720]  Got behind
[01:39.500 --> 01:41.640]  CQB level 2
[01:50.470 --> 01:52.610]  I don't know. I got shot at from down below.
[01:55.530 --> 02:02.050]  I did not kill that guy. You launched his body across the floor. That was awesome. That was a grenade
[02:03.770 --> 02:04.210]  Oh
[02:10.410 --> 02:11.830]  I'm gonna guess that's not us
[02:14.630 --> 02:17.070]  Okay, well got shit on
[02:18.490 --> 02:25.930]  It's what you let out and put your mouth around his barrel. Yeah, please pull the trigger sir. It's just you Andrew. Oh shit
[02:25.930 --> 02:27.910]  Okay. Oh look at that ladder Andrew. Yeah
[02:32.490 --> 02:34.310]  This animation is great Tom Clancy
[02:36.690 --> 02:41.090]  Tom! Down! Up! Down! Up! What do I do?
[02:46.390 --> 02:48.930]  I think you were literally stuck. I don't think you could have moved
[02:53.370 --> 02:56.530]  Lock in lock in. Don't suck
[02:57.670 --> 02:59.650]  Why are we playing on Xbox and not PC?
[03:00.690 --> 03:02.090]  You did this
[03:03.190 --> 03:06.210]  Facecam? That would have been so much easier. Is this game even on Xbox?
[03:06.210 --> 03:08.150]  I just thought of that what I'm sorry on PC
[03:08.830 --> 03:10.190]  Yeah, is this on PC?
[03:10.910 --> 03:11.490]  maybe the
[03:12.230 --> 03:15.030]  The faces wouldn't work on PC. I don't know. I think that's why
[03:19.680 --> 03:20.140]  I
[03:21.100 --> 03:26.780]  Don't know. That's not really cover. Fuck. I've kind of never stopped working with him, so it's hard for me to remember Ray
[03:26.780 --> 03:32.880]  Yeah, but maybe maybe you can shed some light was he always did Gavin always do the thing where?
[03:33.620 --> 03:38.100]  You would decide on something and then create it and then put it out and then be like
[03:38.100 --> 03:39.260]  Why do we do it this way?
[03:42.300 --> 03:45.580]  Was that a thing back then too? I feel like that was a thing for all
[03:46.820 --> 03:52.160]  But you and Gavin came up with the most ideas so you would traditionally be like, let's do this the week later be like
[03:52.160 --> 03:52.900]  Why do we this suck?
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.580]  And then I would be asleep during the let's play Gavin loves to give notes on videos that are already out
[04:01.140 --> 04:03.980]  Hindsight is 40-40. That's what Andrew says. Mm-hmm
[04:11.540 --> 04:12.000]  Oh
[04:12.740 --> 04:19.100]  Underrated joke there by Ray. Oh, oh what? Oh, I didn't kill him. I'm ass
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.390]  Multi-language out there. No, that was me. I shot you
[04:28.240 --> 04:35.000]  Through the window through the window which window through the walls. Yeah. I got him
[04:41.120 --> 04:42.760]  It's this map I can't do this map
[04:45.420 --> 04:50.640]  Yeah, it's the mouse on PC by the way, but yeah, you can do the cameras it did or it didn't come out
[04:50.640 --> 04:52.560]  It's it did. Oh, oh
[05:01.540 --> 05:02.760]  That's great the thermals
[05:03.660 --> 05:06.180]  Didn't help you at all. I
[05:06.180 --> 05:09.800]  Panic thermals again throwing a grenade. Hey when that happens
[05:11.280 --> 05:16.760]  Andrew just got shot in the cabbage. Oh, all right, Andrew. You just got to get 21 dudes. Oh
[05:16.760 --> 05:19.760]  Yeah out the window. You just have to kill the legal drinking age. Oh, he's coming in the door
[05:21.380 --> 05:24.280]  Wish my name was door. Oh
[05:25.620 --> 05:28.580]  That's it just camp it yeah, they're gonna come in one at a time. There you go
[05:29.760 --> 05:35.340]  Are you using a pistol? I'm using a SMG single fire single shot. Yeah
[05:36.340 --> 05:40.560]  What should we do? Yeah, you're rinsing get away from me Karen right now
[05:41.220 --> 05:43.880]  Well, he is next to the kitchen sink. Hey
[05:44.360 --> 05:45.200]  Dane cook everybody
[05:49.680 --> 05:52.300]  Andrew shooting his own cabbage. I just had to see if it would explode
[05:53.840 --> 05:55.320]  It's 2008. There's no
[05:55.320 --> 05:58.460]  I believe in Tom Clancy ray
[05:59.680 --> 06:01.360]  Physics what went in yet?
[06:03.740 --> 06:05.960]  What's the game with the melons Oh
[06:07.120 --> 06:08.840]  They're alive Oh
[06:12.620 --> 06:13.120]  The
[06:13.980 --> 06:15.640]  Mission impossible to guy game
[06:17.440 --> 06:22.180]  No, it was like hey, it was like Kane and Lynch or army of two or one of those
[06:22.180 --> 06:27.220]  Oh Kane and Lynch stranglehold or maybe it was uh, yeah, that was it. What was it?
[06:27.960 --> 06:35.620]  Stranglehold stranglehold stranglehold. Oh great melon heavy John Woo's stranglehold. Yeah. Yeah. What was it? The pseudo sequel to hard-boiled?
[06:37.660 --> 06:38.020]  I
[06:38.020 --> 06:42.460]  Still wanna see hard-boiled. I got good movie. I bought it but it was like a bootleg so I didn't watch it
[06:43.780 --> 06:47.000]  That I thought it was out on blu-ray, but it turns out it's a
[06:47.760 --> 06:49.620]  red way I

[09:13.800 --> 09:14.400]  Oh, you see him.
[09:15.520 --> 09:15.820]  Nice.
[09:16.720 --> 09:18.640]  Dude, that guy shrugged that bullet off.
[09:21.660 --> 09:22.000]  FIVE!
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.080]  Stuck out just long enough.
[09:24.680 --> 09:25.700]  Did you get shot in the dirt box?
[09:27.180 --> 09:27.640]  Alright, here we go.
[09:29.100 --> 09:30.620]  Gavin, would you say this is the run?
[09:31.260 --> 09:33.200]  No, this is the one before the run.
[09:33.680 --> 09:33.880]  Okay.
[09:34.280 --> 09:36.320]  Wait, the last one we did, did Gavin call the run?
[09:36.420 --> 09:37.040]  Or was it the one after?
[09:37.960 --> 09:38.860]  Was he actually right?
[09:39.420 --> 09:40.520]  Oh no! Why?
[09:41.960 --> 09:42.820]  Uh, guy in the garage.
[09:43.120 --> 09:44.520]  He's behind the car.
[09:44.660 --> 09:45.540]  Who flashbanged me?
[09:54.390 --> 09:55.110]  Did you get that guy, Geoff?
[09:55.430 --> 09:55.810]  Yeah, I got him.
[09:57.630 --> 09:59.930]  If you're referring to the guy who was trying to kill us, yeah, I got him.
[10:00.290 --> 10:01.030]  Oh, what?
[10:02.190 --> 10:03.730]  That spell well sucks!
[10:04.550 --> 10:10.230]  Oh, shit, I didn't even see that fucking guy.
[10:10.230 --> 10:11.090]  On the patio.
[10:12.230 --> 10:13.690]  You were in the thick of it there, Ray.
[10:14.170 --> 10:14.890]  I sure was.
[10:17.130 --> 10:18.410]  It spawns you out in the open
[10:18.410 --> 10:20.070]  and you can't even move for like a second.
[10:21.910 --> 10:22.470]  Nice, Geoff.
[10:26.200 --> 10:26.520]  Ow.
[10:29.340 --> 10:30.140]  There's a dude in there.
[10:30.140 --> 10:31.100]  I don't know if I got him or not.
[10:31.160 --> 10:32.220]  Did you die again already?
[10:33.880 --> 10:34.520]  What happened?
[10:36.340 --> 10:37.520]  Oh, look at my face.
[10:37.640 --> 10:38.460]  Look at my dead face.
[10:38.460 --> 10:40.200]  Oh my god, I shouldn't talk shit.
[10:40.260 --> 10:41.140]  I got shot from behind, I think.
[10:43.980 --> 10:44.500]  Rough one.
[10:44.600 --> 10:44.960]  Rough one.
[10:51.220 --> 10:51.540]  Jesus.
[10:55.880 --> 10:56.600]  Oh my god.
[10:58.240 --> 10:58.800]  I don't think
[10:58.800 --> 11:00.480]  I hit him once. That was horrible.
[11:01.540 --> 11:01.860]  Jesus Christ.
[11:01.860 --> 11:04.640]  Let's see if we can all get to the roof and rappel through the skylight.
[11:05.880 --> 11:07.040]  Oh, that's an idea.
[11:07.460 --> 11:08.440]  Imagine how badass we would look.
[11:08.920 --> 11:09.520]  How do we get to the roof?
[11:09.980 --> 11:11.200]  I'll die to one grenade, probably.
[11:12.700 --> 11:14.300]  Get one of us through.
[11:14.540 --> 11:15.320]  Nice, Andrew.
[11:15.660 --> 11:16.060]  Thank you.
[11:21.030 --> 11:23.210]  That spot Andrew's in right now is pretty good.
[11:23.910 --> 11:24.110]  Uh.
[11:24.410 --> 11:28.070]  Geoff killed teammate and I'm suddenly dead.
[11:29.810 --> 11:30.450]  Uh, sorry.
[11:31.850 --> 11:32.390]  Uh.
[11:33.130 --> 11:35.290]  Andrew hasn't moved from that spot the whole round.
[11:35.710 --> 11:36.130]  Uh.
[11:36.710 --> 11:36.970]  Oh.
[11:38.290 --> 11:39.750]  That was a really good grenade there.
[11:43.940 --> 11:45.740]  You outwinned that guy, Geoff, I think.
[11:46.380 --> 11:47.560]  That's my move.
[11:47.740 --> 11:49.240]  That's how you know I've been here.
[11:49.840 --> 11:50.220]  Barbecue!
[11:51.080 --> 11:53.060]  It's not enough for me to kill a guy, eventually.
[11:53.240 --> 11:54.840]  I also want you to see how he died.
[11:55.820 --> 11:56.780]  How his body fell.
[12:01.380 --> 12:02.700]  Just take ten each and we're good.
[12:03.240 --> 12:03.420]  Okay.
[12:04.240 --> 12:04.620]  Easy.
[12:05.780 --> 12:06.520]  Real sorry about that.
[12:08.500 --> 12:09.180]  Accidents happen.
[12:11.120 --> 12:11.900]  It was a lower spine.
[12:12.320 --> 12:14.180]  If you hadn't...
[12:14.180 --> 12:16.440]  You definitely would have been paralyzed had you lived.
[12:22.740 --> 12:23.100]  Nice.
[12:24.080 --> 12:24.980]  Alright, nineteen more.
[12:26.400 --> 12:27.900]  Alright, Andrew, just nineteen more.
[12:27.960 --> 12:28.160]  Yeah, easy.
[12:29.360 --> 12:30.880]  I bet it's even easier from the roof.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.660]  Oh my god, Geoff's just...
[12:36.200 --> 12:38.620]  Just going back and forth between Andrew and the guy.
[12:38.960 --> 12:40.020]  Like a kid lost in a mall.
[12:40.180 --> 12:40.440]  Ah!
[12:41.960 --> 12:42.320]  Geoff!
[12:45.540 --> 12:46.740]  Just about had him, too.
[12:47.180 --> 12:47.840]  Promote that guy.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.520]  So we push into the roof, is that the plan?
[12:50.000 --> 12:50.940]  Yeah, I guess so.
[12:54.260 --> 12:55.300]  Go in front!
[12:56.900 --> 12:57.460]  Good shot.
[12:58.820 --> 12:59.900]  Thank you, thank you.
[13:02.960 --> 13:03.400]  Oh!
[13:04.060 --> 13:05.300]  Oh, shoot through a flashbang!
[13:07.760 --> 13:08.920]  Was he blind?
[13:09.460 --> 13:11.020]  I was blind. Did you throw a flashbang?
[13:11.460 --> 13:11.720]  No.
[13:12.300 --> 13:13.000]  Oh, that might have been them.
[13:14.160 --> 13:15.140]  Oh, what the fuck?
[13:15.140 --> 13:16.880]  Oh my god.
[13:17.520 --> 13:19.400]  There's somebody in the fountain area, Gavin, to your right.
[13:21.100 --> 13:21.780]  Yeah, there is.
[13:24.620 --> 13:25.980]  It's pretty hard to rush the roof.
[13:29.500 --> 13:32.600]  Oh, you threw a tire at him.
[13:35.120 --> 13:35.840]  I'm out!
[13:37.360 --> 13:37.780]  Man, Andrew.
[13:39.640 --> 13:40.400]  Ray, check this out.
[13:40.820 --> 13:41.280]  Oh, fuck.
[13:41.700 --> 13:42.420]  Yeah, what's up, where are you?
[13:46.760 --> 13:47.480]  Oh, the tire.
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.720]  There's at least one guy in the garage.
[13:52.460 --> 13:52.780]  Alright.
[13:53.440 --> 13:55.860]  There's a couple more guys on that side room in the garage.
[14:00.830 --> 14:01.490]  Oh, fuck.
[14:02.150 --> 14:03.070]  Watch your left, watch your left.
[14:04.090 --> 14:05.590]  Get off the car, Ray, you idiot!
[14:06.370 --> 14:07.010]  Immediately died.
[14:08.170 --> 14:09.150]  Oh, another guy, another guy around the corner.
[14:09.510 --> 14:10.150]  Did he throw a grenade at me?
[14:10.410 --> 14:11.390]  Yeah, he did. Flashbang.
[14:11.470 --> 14:13.070]  Oh, I can't see. Bad flash.
[14:13.810 --> 14:14.210]  Oh.
[14:18.090 --> 14:20.390]  Alright, Ray, I'm gonna need you to kill 23 dudes.
[14:21.250 --> 14:21.770]  Alright, locking.
[14:21.970 --> 14:22.890]  Just like the old days.
[14:23.110 --> 14:23.770]  Oh, shit.
[14:24.390 --> 14:28.230]  Alright, 22 more to go.
[14:28.490 --> 14:29.110]  Where did he go?
[14:30.230 --> 14:30.890]  He evaporated.
[14:34.850 --> 14:36.210]  Ray's breathing him right now.
[14:39.930 --> 14:43.450]  If you could huff a person from history, who would it be?
[14:44.810 --> 14:46.130]  Ooh, Jimi Hendrix.
[14:47.970 --> 14:50.470]  He's gotta have a concoction of smells on him.
[14:50.830 --> 14:51.790]  I'd probably do Willie Nelson.
[14:52.390 --> 14:53.710]  He's still alive.
[14:53.850 --> 14:54.810]  That's why I didn't say Willie Nelson.
[14:56.430 --> 14:57.350]  I just heard a door open.
[14:57.710 --> 14:59.070]  Oh, my feetsies.
[14:59.770 --> 15:01.110]  I think I'd huff Jesus.
[15:01.770 --> 15:02.130]  Yeah?
[15:03.210 --> 15:04.350]  I'm thinking Oppenheimer.
[15:05.490 --> 15:06.190]  Oh, wow.
[15:06.410 --> 15:06.950]  Why Oppenheimer?
[15:07.330 --> 15:10.050]  I just feel like there's a lot of regret in that whiff.
[15:10.630 --> 15:10.990]  Jeez.
[15:16.550 --> 15:17.850]  Appears to be somebody in the garage.
[15:18.310 --> 15:19.670]  I'm ass. That guy's still behind the car.
[15:20.510 --> 15:20.790]  I think.
[15:21.830 --> 15:22.650]  Behind the car, you say?
[15:23.230 --> 15:24.010]  Yeah, in the garage.
[15:24.290 --> 15:25.370]  There's a guy in the staircase.
[15:28.790 --> 15:29.150]  Nice.
[15:29.410 --> 15:30.390]  Someone shot me in the back.
[15:31.450 --> 15:31.990]  Not it.
[15:37.260 --> 15:38.540]  Oh, I can't see shit.
[15:38.540 --> 15:38.920]  No, no.
[15:38.920 --> 15:40.200]  I can't see shit. Where am I?
[15:47.410 --> 15:48.590]  Not sure if there's a guy by the fountain.
[15:49.050 --> 15:50.110]  There is a guy by the fountain.
[15:51.530 --> 15:52.870]  I think by Andrew's spot.
[15:54.490 --> 15:55.410]  Oh, we got a whole bunch.
[15:55.510 --> 15:56.750]  We got like four guys.
[15:57.010 --> 15:57.470]  I'm throwing a grenade.
[16:02.860 --> 16:03.900]  Okay, coming up behind you, Ray.
[16:04.660 --> 16:04.980]  Yep.
[16:05.780 --> 16:06.260]  Got me.
[16:08.500 --> 16:09.440]  Oh, I see him. I see him.
[16:11.400 --> 16:12.960]  I think this guy by the fountain is still alive.
[16:13.400 --> 16:14.120]  Oh, stairs.
[16:18.550 --> 16:19.630]  I'm going around the fountain.
[16:20.430 --> 16:20.610]  Yep.
[16:23.070 --> 16:23.950]  What happened to you?
[16:23.950 --> 16:24.770]  Oh, I see him. I see him.
[16:27.510 --> 16:27.910]  Motherfucker.
[16:30.090 --> 16:30.410]  Fountain man.
[16:32.690 --> 16:33.570]  Fountain man's down.
[16:34.450 --> 16:34.710]  Nice.
[16:34.790 --> 16:36.190]  That was the B-side to Spoon Man.
[16:36.390 --> 16:37.650]  That nearly is successful.
[16:37.730 --> 16:37.790]  No.
[16:45.200 --> 16:45.860]  Rappelling down.
[16:45.860 --> 16:47.220]  I think I got him.
[16:48.480 --> 16:50.040]  God, these guys are aggressive on this map.
[16:51.020 --> 16:52.140]  Yeah, it's a snug map.
[16:52.200 --> 16:52.920]  Why did I throw a grenade?
[16:55.860 --> 16:56.460]  Frame rate.
[16:56.700 --> 16:56.880]  Damn.
[16:57.020 --> 16:59.820]  That made the game lag so much because you broke glass.
[17:07.480 --> 17:09.320]  Somebody shot me over your direction.
[17:09.560 --> 17:10.720]  Oh, behind me.
[17:12.340 --> 17:13.280]  Going up with you, Gavin.
[17:15.620 --> 17:16.160]  I need help.
[17:17.420 --> 17:18.100]  I need help.
[17:18.660 --> 17:19.060]  That's you.
[17:19.140 --> 17:22.340]  I don't think it's letting me up because you're in front of it.
[17:22.780 --> 17:23.860]  Sorry, get up now.
[17:25.180 --> 17:25.780]  Get up now.
[17:25.940 --> 17:26.260]  I'm with you.
[17:26.320 --> 17:26.620]  I'm with you.
[17:27.860 --> 17:33.400]  I wish I didn't throw grenades as often as I did on accident.
[17:34.540 --> 17:35.140]  Bad spot.
[17:35.620 --> 17:35.900]  Hi, guys.
[17:38.620 --> 17:39.680]  Let's go to the room with the ladder.
[17:40.040 --> 17:40.480]  Where's that at?
[17:42.260 --> 17:43.760]  Where's the ladder room?
[17:43.760 --> 17:44.640]  Oh, it might be over there.
[17:44.820 --> 17:46.320]  Oh, somebody's over here.
[17:46.860 --> 17:47.840]  I found it.
[17:49.060 --> 17:49.900]  You're in it?
[17:50.020 --> 17:51.820]  Oh, my God.
[17:52.100 --> 17:52.920]  So did they.
[17:57.910 --> 17:58.650]  Climbing the ladder.
[17:59.850 --> 18:00.790]  Down to 13.
[18:02.030 --> 18:03.330]  Is that us? Is that a grenade?
[18:04.310 --> 18:05.610]  Oh, my God, Andrew.
[18:05.710 --> 18:06.730]  You missed at his head.
[18:07.190 --> 18:10.490]  Oh, they're all up here. They're all on the roof.
[18:12.450 --> 18:13.750]  There's like four of them up there.
[18:14.230 --> 18:15.870]  They heard the plan. They're on our comms.
[18:21.350 --> 18:23.030]  Alright, here we go. A little confusion.
[18:23.250 --> 18:24.470]  A little smoke. They won't see me.
[18:29.570 --> 18:32.330]  Oh, Ray, they're just going to fucking walk up single file for you.
[18:33.470 --> 18:35.810]  I might have fucked myself on that side, but...
[18:35.810 --> 18:37.210]  If you can kill one, you can kill ten.
[18:37.390 --> 18:37.670]  You're good.
[18:43.050 --> 18:44.730]  That grenade does not last very long.
[18:46.790 --> 18:48.150]  That is something we share.
[18:49.470 --> 18:50.030]  Oh, shit!
[18:50.390 --> 18:52.250]  Oh, another one!
[18:53.110 --> 18:53.390]  Nine!
[18:55.570 --> 18:56.310]  We're so close.
[18:56.390 --> 18:56.770]  We're getting there.
[18:57.570 --> 18:58.630]  We almost got to the roof.
[19:00.530 --> 19:01.710]  Oh, I did. You don't want to go up there.
[19:02.550 --> 19:04.590]  Do you think we're about to usher in a renaissance of this game
[19:04.590 --> 19:06.690]  where suddenly millions of people will be playing it again?
[19:06.850 --> 19:07.390]  God, I hope so.
[19:07.390 --> 19:08.330]  Ubisoft will be so pumped.
[19:11.310 --> 19:11.710]  What?
[19:11.710 --> 19:16.030]  Well, they poured all their money and efforts into Rainbow Six Siege X,
[19:16.050 --> 19:18.370]  so I think they'd be a little upset if everyone went back to playing this one.
[19:19.930 --> 19:22.810]  Guys, we don't need to keep making Beyond Good and Evil 2!
[19:23.610 --> 19:26.690]  Put Terrorist Hunt back in Siege, and we'll fucking play it again.
[19:29.070 --> 19:31.470]  Oh my god, a lot of enemies by the fountain.
[19:32.810 --> 19:34.150]  Yeah, I got the one on the stairs.
[19:34.910 --> 19:35.890]  Three upstairs.
[19:36.250 --> 19:37.350]  Three on the stairs at the beginning.
[19:38.950 --> 19:39.590]  Shit.
[19:45.970 --> 19:47.170]  Fountain down.
[19:47.610 --> 19:47.910]  Alright.
[19:48.970 --> 19:50.510]  Fountain clear, I believe.
[19:51.750 --> 19:52.750]  Alright, moving up to the patio.
[19:52.870 --> 19:53.170]  No!
[19:55.030 --> 19:55.590]  Stupid.
[19:56.970 --> 20:00.090]  Fountain's clear, but exterior house not.
[20:00.290 --> 20:00.750]  Stupid.
[20:00.750 --> 20:01.210]  At the barbecue.
[20:03.890 --> 20:04.670]  Uh oh.
[20:05.270 --> 20:06.110]  Barbecue's down.
[20:06.110 --> 20:06.150]  Barbecue's down.
[20:14.180 --> 20:15.780]  Alright, I'm up on the patio right now.
[20:16.020 --> 20:17.360]  Yeah, I'm pushing D on the patio.
[20:17.440 --> 20:18.000]  Oh fuck!
[20:18.460 --> 20:20.780]  Right out the door and put his penis in my mouth.
[20:22.420 --> 20:23.720]  He's hard for me as well.
[20:23.860 --> 20:24.520]  Got him, I think.
[20:31.600 --> 20:33.580]  I'm stuck on a fricking bench or something.
[20:33.800 --> 20:35.220]  Where's the shooting coming from?
[20:35.740 --> 20:37.240]  Alright, should we go up the rope?
[20:38.580 --> 20:39.740]  Oh, there's two guys in here.
[20:40.740 --> 20:41.640]  They're coming, they're coming!
[20:47.500 --> 20:47.880]  Wow!
[20:48.500 --> 20:49.700]  There was one more guy in there though.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.120]  I'm gonna throw a grenade up and then head up.
[20:57.750 --> 20:58.530]  Oh, Geoff!
[21:01.450 --> 21:02.670]  Oh, he's pushing you, Geoff!
[21:02.850 --> 21:03.070]  Ah!
[21:03.830 --> 21:05.130]  Damn, man.
[21:05.430 --> 21:07.170]  What a terrible place this was!
[21:09.170 --> 21:10.270]  Gavin wasn't terrible.
[21:11.050 --> 21:12.590]  Well, I threw a grenade up there, I couldn't see.
[21:12.590 --> 21:13.530]  Dead at 11.
[21:15.250 --> 21:17.130]  You got two guys on spawn too, Andrew.
[21:17.910 --> 21:18.110]  Okay.
[21:19.470 --> 21:20.550]  That's where Geoff died, I guess.
[21:20.590 --> 21:21.970]  So they might have gone the other way.
[21:22.870 --> 21:25.210]  They were filtering out at the garage.
[21:25.270 --> 21:26.090]  Down the garage stairwell.
[21:29.550 --> 21:31.030]  They probably might have gone back up that way.
[21:31.110 --> 21:31.670]  Going back to spawn.
[21:36.120 --> 21:37.620]  I'm not seeing anybody.
[21:39.020 --> 21:40.360]  They were definitely...
[21:40.720 --> 21:41.880]  You dancing over there, Gavin?
[21:41.880 --> 21:43.640]  There you go, Gavin.
[21:43.720 --> 21:44.040]  Oh!
[21:45.040 --> 21:47.020]  That grenade rolled right back down.
[21:47.900 --> 21:48.840]  He ran into it.
[21:50.100 --> 21:50.580]  Alright.
[21:51.980 --> 21:53.500]  Nine. Tied for our record.
[21:54.140 --> 21:55.380]  Oh, Gavin!
[21:55.620 --> 21:56.000]  Grenade!
[21:56.640 --> 21:58.360]  Oh, Gavin.
[21:59.820 --> 22:00.760]  Oh, Gavin.
[22:02.080 --> 22:03.880]  It's an unpredictable awk.
[22:05.780 --> 22:06.460]  Stairs!
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.260]  Eight. Record.
[22:10.240 --> 22:10.880]  PB.
[22:11.340 --> 22:12.300]  Alright. Try again.
[22:15.900 --> 22:16.980]  You got him!
[22:17.540 --> 22:18.100]  You got him!
[22:19.600 --> 22:21.240]  Gavin got the gobble.
[22:21.560 --> 22:21.840]  Okay.
[22:22.920 --> 22:23.440]  Bring us home.
[22:33.060 --> 22:34.420]  Pushing the stairs.
[22:35.440 --> 22:36.460]  Those are some bad stairs.
[22:36.780 --> 22:38.560]  Everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine.
[22:43.280 --> 22:44.420]  It's all fine.
[22:52.830 --> 22:53.490]  Don't cook.
[22:53.490 --> 22:54.430]  Don't cook.
[22:55.170 --> 22:57.250]  Nope! Nope! Nope! Nope!
[22:57.330 --> 22:58.350]  I don't wanna cook! I don't wanna cook!
[23:01.910 --> 23:02.310]  Dang.
[23:03.010 --> 23:03.750]  This is the one.
[23:05.390 --> 23:06.250]  Alright, here we go.
[23:06.890 --> 23:09.710]  I like that going left and clearing fountain and all that.
[23:09.830 --> 23:10.570]  And then slowly pushing.
[23:11.270 --> 23:11.810]  You wanna do that again?
[23:12.650 --> 23:13.050]  Oh.
[23:23.660 --> 23:24.060]  Shit!
[23:26.220 --> 23:27.800]  Behind the box to the right.
[23:28.000 --> 23:28.680]  Next to my body.
[23:30.100 --> 23:31.120]  Oh, I see him, I see him.
[23:33.240 --> 23:34.020]  I got him, I got him.
[23:34.220 --> 23:34.500]  Nice.
[23:36.480 --> 23:37.120]  Oh, oh shit.
[23:37.700 --> 23:38.220]  Guy at fountain.
[23:39.380 --> 23:45.120]  Oh, uh, the stairs, the stairs.
[23:45.500 --> 23:45.780]  Stairs?
[23:46.480 --> 23:46.840]  Got him.
[23:46.980 --> 23:47.860]  Fountain guy's still alive.
[23:48.640 --> 23:51.340]  Oh, he fucking, you can see my shoulder.
[23:51.460 --> 23:52.140]  That was a terrible cover.
[23:52.780 --> 23:53.860]  I got one of the fountain guys.
[23:53.960 --> 23:55.400]  I don't know if there's more behind me.
[23:55.400 --> 23:56.400]  Fucked, fucked.
[23:59.060 --> 24:00.080]  Oh yeah, one guy.
[24:00.920 --> 24:02.420]  Geoff's still working the stairs.
[24:02.740 --> 24:03.020]  Really?
[24:03.200 --> 24:04.420]  I saw that blind fire.
[24:05.220 --> 24:05.740]  Really?
[24:06.620 --> 24:08.800]  Oh, I spawned inside the house, what the fuck.
[24:09.100 --> 24:12.620]  Oh, I think there's some guys behind us.
[24:14.600 --> 24:15.380]  Get me a sitrep.
[24:20.120 --> 24:22.860]  I think Andrew's fourth eye means he can see during blind fire.
[24:27.920 --> 24:28.440]  Nice.
[24:34.970 --> 24:35.310]  Oops.
[24:36.050 --> 24:36.390]  Where was that?
[24:38.490 --> 24:38.930]  Ow.
[24:42.990 --> 24:44.010]  Oh, whoa, whoa.
[24:44.150 --> 24:44.830]  Rappel, I think?
[24:45.170 --> 24:45.290]  Yep.
[24:46.810 --> 24:52.510]  Oh, they're from the rappel window, I think.
[24:53.430 --> 24:54.170]  Oh my god, I'm dead.
[24:55.390 --> 24:55.830]  Dead.
[24:56.110 --> 24:56.910]  Stupid and dead.
[24:58.450 --> 25:00.030]  Oh, I got cabbaged.
[25:00.330 --> 25:02.090]  There's a dude in that room with the
[25:02.090 --> 25:04.670]  shut blinds.
[25:05.310 --> 25:06.010]  Oh, is there?
[25:06.110 --> 25:07.690]  There might be him.
[25:08.210 --> 25:09.030]  Just popped out.
[25:10.350 --> 25:10.610]  Sir?
[25:12.070 --> 25:13.370]  Right behind you!
[25:17.830 --> 25:18.890]  That was crazy.
[25:19.090 --> 25:21.230]  Go over here and reevaluate.
[25:21.630 --> 25:22.730]  You rubbed butts with that guy.
[25:27.830 --> 25:28.090]  Nice.
[25:30.070 --> 25:30.910]  19 more, huh?
[25:31.330 --> 25:33.330]  Hey fellas, you know what? You guys are gonna go down the stairs.
[25:33.970 --> 25:34.510]  Calling it right now.
[25:36.310 --> 25:36.950]  Oh, one of you were.
[25:36.950 --> 25:37.430]  Oh!
[25:38.950 --> 25:40.630]  Ah, good try.
[25:45.130 --> 25:46.250]  We're gonna get this.
[25:46.830 --> 25:47.850]  Oh, we're gonna get it right here.
[25:48.970 --> 25:50.430]  Oh, my controller is...
[25:50.750 --> 25:51.030]  Sir?
[25:52.290 --> 25:54.850]  Hold on. I can't move.
[25:55.390 --> 25:55.910]  Oh god, dude.
[25:59.170 --> 26:01.070]  I can't out-move my controller.
[26:02.530 --> 26:03.390]  Hold on.
[26:05.810 --> 26:06.770]  I literally...
[26:07.170 --> 26:08.930]  Oh, my game's freaking out.
[26:09.170 --> 26:10.030]  Oh, maybe that's why?
[26:11.210 --> 26:12.590]  Signed in elsewhere.
[26:13.670 --> 26:15.450]  Wait, did someone turn on the other Xbox
[26:15.450 --> 26:16.250]  and sign me out?
[26:18.830 --> 26:20.630]  Gavin has left your Xbox Live party.
[26:20.970 --> 26:21.990]  Oh, shit!
[26:22.530 --> 26:23.950]  At least we weren't on a good run.
[26:24.990 --> 26:27.590]  You think your wife logged in?
[26:27.810 --> 26:28.170]  On a 360?
[26:29.370 --> 26:29.570]  What?
[26:30.130 --> 26:30.610]  Rayped.
[26:30.950 --> 26:33.050]  Why did you put me on Gavin's Xbox?
[26:33.510 --> 26:35.730]  Ray's controller hopped to the fifth Xbox
[26:35.730 --> 26:37.150]  and it signed me in.
[26:39.350 --> 26:40.850]  What do you mean?
[26:42.670 --> 26:44.330]  Now, that's never happened.
[26:44.470 --> 26:45.870]  I don't think we've ever had that happen.
[26:46.990 --> 26:49.330]  I've never seen anything like that.
[26:51.150 --> 26:52.970]  Hey, which Xbox do I connect?
[26:53.190 --> 26:54.290]  I also brought another controller.
[26:55.890 --> 26:57.570]  Well, part of this is because...
[26:57.570 --> 26:58.850]  They switch?
[26:59.110 --> 27:01.610]  The controllers literally just switch.
[27:02.310 --> 27:03.810]  Look, we're under the regulation budget.
[27:03.990 --> 27:05.670]  Geoff bought four cheap Chinese
[27:05.670 --> 27:06.930]  controllers off Amazon.
[27:07.330 --> 27:09.550]  It was unclear that they were cheap
[27:09.550 --> 27:11.150]  Chinese controllers when I bought them.
[27:11.410 --> 27:12.790]  They just looked like controllers.
[27:12.790 --> 27:14.630]  They say made in China on the battery thing
[27:14.630 --> 27:16.630]  and there's no X on the jewel.
[27:16.890 --> 27:18.790]  But they've done the job.
[27:19.870 --> 27:21.650]  Can we get some more support on Patreon
[27:21.650 --> 27:22.990]  so Geoff can afford an official
[27:22.990 --> 27:24.770]  fucking 360 controller?
[27:24.770 --> 27:27.950]  Look, I'm doing the best that I can here.
[27:27.990 --> 27:29.810]  Even if you got the wired version.
[27:32.010 --> 27:33.130]  What the fuck?
[27:34.230 --> 27:34.670]  Alright.
[27:35.890 --> 27:37.690]  I guess I need another invite.
[27:38.030 --> 27:39.850]  Thanks for coming over today, Ray.
[27:40.050 --> 27:40.410]  And Tina.
[27:40.850 --> 27:43.370]  Thanks for inviting us.
[27:43.830 --> 27:45.070]  I'm so glad. We've been
[27:45.710 --> 27:47.930]  trying to set this up, this exact
[27:47.930 --> 27:49.810]  thing up with you for almost two years now.
[27:49.930 --> 27:51.570]  It's taken us this long to get it.
[27:51.930 --> 27:52.130]  Yeah.
[27:53.750 --> 27:55.230]  Hopefully if we do this again
[27:55.230 --> 27:57.170]  there won't be 45 minutes of sign-in issues.
[27:57.490 --> 27:58.230]  Yeah, no.
[27:58.490 --> 27:59.870]  Next time I'll just bring my own Xbox.
[28:00.470 --> 28:02.710]  Well-oiled machine next time.
[28:03.430 --> 28:05.150]  But no, this has been a blast. I'm loving this.
[28:06.010 --> 28:07.050]  What year did you
[28:07.050 --> 28:07.590]  quit, Ray?
[28:08.730 --> 28:09.210]  2015.
[28:10.290 --> 28:11.470]  I would have guessed 2014.
[28:11.970 --> 28:14.770]  I think at the time we were actually doing a Rainbow Six
[28:15.810 --> 28:16.290]  campaign.
[28:16.930 --> 28:18.750]  It was either Rainbow Six or Mini Golf.
[28:19.230 --> 28:21.210]  Because Geoff just
[28:21.210 --> 28:23.030]  asked that we finish that playthrough before I left.
[28:23.110 --> 28:23.810]  And I'm like, yeah, absolutely.
[28:24.570 --> 28:27.190]  Instead of a two weeks notice, it was just a Mini Golf finish up.
[28:27.710 --> 28:28.490]  Pretty much, yeah.
[28:28.850 --> 28:30.050]  It was 18 holes notice.
[28:30.890 --> 28:32.850]  Alright, I'll give you a guess. 36 holes notice max.
[28:33.250 --> 28:35.070]  What if that's what we have to do? Whenever one of us quits
[28:35.070 --> 28:36.430]  we have to give an 18 hole notice.
[28:38.670 --> 28:39.150]  I remember
[28:39.150 --> 28:41.130]  telling Geoff in that meeting like, hey, this is like
[28:41.130 --> 28:42.990]  we don't have to make this whole thing. We don't need to have
[28:42.990 --> 28:45.110]  like a no episode about it and then fucking three hours
[28:45.110 --> 28:45.310]  later.
[28:47.490 --> 28:48.570]  Like I fucking hate it here.
[28:50.350 --> 28:51.690]  Alright, let's go. We all in?
[28:52.330 --> 28:52.930]  I'm joining.
[28:53.690 --> 28:55.390]  Okay. I knew something was up because
[28:55.890 --> 28:57.670]  I think it was the first time you'd ever like
[28:57.670 --> 28:59.030]  address the room with anything.
[28:59.430 --> 29:00.150]  I was like, oh.
[29:00.490 --> 29:03.570]  I tell a story all the time. That was
[29:03.570 --> 29:05.230]  the most stress I've ever been in my life.
[29:07.550 --> 29:09.570]  Hey, I'd like to address more than one of you at once
[29:09.570 --> 29:09.990]  for a second.
[29:11.270 --> 29:13.710]  I had to go and tell Geoff that I'm leaving and I'm like
[29:13.710 --> 29:15.750]  I'd rather anything else
[29:15.750 --> 29:16.450]  happen right now.
[29:16.450 --> 29:18.670]  That was a rough conversation.
[29:18.850 --> 29:20.550]  That was not great. But you know what Ray?
[29:21.250 --> 29:22.530]  I respected it and I
[29:22.530 --> 29:24.510]  appreciated your honesty and your
[29:25.270 --> 29:25.670]  forthrightness.
[29:26.730 --> 29:28.530]  And I appreciate you taking the conversation
[29:28.530 --> 29:30.590]  and kind of knowing what
[29:30.590 --> 29:31.890]  I was going to do or what I was going to say.
[29:32.410 --> 29:33.930]  Yeah, it was nice to
[29:34.530 --> 29:36.590]  see that you also immediately
[29:36.590 --> 29:38.610]  did well. Like your first day of streaming was insane.
[29:38.610 --> 29:40.490]  Yeah, that was stressful. I'm glad and
[29:40.950 --> 29:42.570]  now ten plus years later it's still
[29:42.570 --> 29:44.510]  my full time job. The way I tried
[29:44.510 --> 29:46.570]  to explain it to people would be when they'd ask me like
[29:47.110 --> 29:48.450]  if I was upset about it, I'd be like
[29:48.450 --> 29:50.710]  why would I be upset with Ray
[29:50.710 --> 29:51.910]  for betting on Ray?
[29:52.390 --> 29:54.450]  The reason I'm Rooster Teeth exists is
[29:54.450 --> 29:56.430]  because we bet on ourselves, you know?
[29:57.050 --> 29:58.690]  True. And it's like it would be so
[29:58.690 --> 30:00.450]  it would be so fucked of me
[30:00.450 --> 30:01.490]  as a person to
[30:02.510 --> 30:04.370]  not support other people that
[30:04.370 --> 30:06.690]  are my friends when they try to do the same thing
[30:06.690 --> 30:07.590]  I did.
[30:08.470 --> 30:10.370]  I'm not saying what you did was very different
[30:10.370 --> 30:12.010]  but you know what I mean, like take a chance,
[30:12.010 --> 30:14.130]  roll the dice, go out on your
[30:14.130 --> 30:14.430]  own.
[30:16.530 --> 30:18.050]  Also I figured you'd fail and you'd be back
[30:18.050 --> 30:20.070]  in three months. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I was young
[30:20.070 --> 30:21.990]  enough to have to just blow up in my face and be like, hey Geoff,
[30:22.130 --> 30:22.330]  psych.
[30:23.910 --> 30:26.230]  Gotcha. I didn't even put your notice
[30:26.230 --> 30:27.030]  in for like a- Oh shit!
[30:28.310 --> 30:30.030]  Goddamn Gavin. I remember being really
[30:30.590 --> 30:31.990]  bummed but then there
[30:31.990 --> 30:34.070]  were a lot of breaching
[30:34.070 --> 30:35.510]  charges in Minecraft that year.
[30:38.790 --> 30:40.210]  You were actually the reason I left.
[30:40.210 --> 30:40.530]  Yeah.
[30:41.690 --> 30:42.770]  I always felt that way.
[30:44.930 --> 30:46.110]  Your last day,
[30:46.350 --> 30:48.370]  Ray, coincidentally, I just happened
[30:48.370 --> 30:49.570]  to go to Austin
[30:49.990 --> 30:52.290]  your final week. And it was one of the
[30:52.290 --> 30:54.270]  most awkward things where you were saying goodbye
[30:54.270 --> 30:56.410]  to everybody in like a big circle
[30:56.410 --> 30:58.070]  and I had just met you
[30:58.070 --> 31:00.230]  and I was in the room and I was like, I guess I'm part
[31:00.230 --> 31:02.090]  of the circle but I have no business being there.
[31:02.410 --> 31:04.230]  You don't know me. It's weird.
[31:05.250 --> 31:06.550]  I think we shook hands
[31:06.550 --> 31:08.330]  and I was like, I don't know what I'm supposed to do
[31:08.330 --> 31:09.890]  here. I tagged you in.
[31:10.250 --> 31:11.570]  I'm out, I'm tagging you in.
[31:12.410 --> 31:14.430]  It's so fucking funny how
[31:14.990 --> 31:16.410]  quietly Andrew was around
[31:16.410 --> 31:17.790]  for so much important stuff.
[31:19.790 --> 31:20.490]  To the point
[31:20.490 --> 31:22.370]  where if he was around, it's like, oh, what's
[31:22.370 --> 31:24.270]  gonna happen? He was like Forrest Gump in the movie.
[31:24.410 --> 31:26.670]  He was part of so many very important things.
[31:26.870 --> 31:27.990]  Oh, there he is with JFK.
[31:32.660 --> 31:33.320]  Grenade out.
[31:34.360 --> 31:34.760]  Yuppers.
[31:37.720 --> 31:38.520]  I'm inside.
[31:40.840 --> 31:42.560]  Oh, I'm flashed.
[31:43.100 --> 31:43.580]  Oh, Ray.
[31:43.820 --> 31:46.080]  Oh, behind! Maybe? I don't know.
[31:46.540 --> 31:48.100]  In the garage?
[31:48.960 --> 31:49.260]  Garage?
[31:49.720 --> 31:51.060]  They went to our spawn location.
[31:51.460 --> 31:53.920]  He threw a grenade.
[31:54.320 --> 31:56.240]  He threw a grenade. He flashbanged
[31:56.240 --> 31:56.680]  me again.
[32:01.100 --> 32:02.220]  Nice. Oh, fuck.
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.260]  Alright, I died once. There's one guy
[32:04.260 --> 32:06.200]  in one of the repel areas. Also, I think I just leveled up
[32:06.200 --> 32:06.960]  something. What the fuck?
[32:09.260 --> 32:10.080]  To your right.
[32:10.480 --> 32:11.580]  Gavin in that. Right there.
[32:12.780 --> 32:13.920]  I'm gonna go clear fountain.
[32:16.260 --> 32:17.700]  Ah, shit. Ah, shit!
[32:18.160 --> 32:18.760]  Let me get out of your way.
[32:20.220 --> 32:21.960]  I'm gonna support you, Andrew, since they're...
[32:22.760 --> 32:23.680]  Well, nevermind. Ray went to.
[32:24.740 --> 32:25.680]  On the patio.
[32:25.760 --> 32:26.580]  I think it's clear.
[32:28.420 --> 32:29.540]  Still on the patio, I think.
[32:32.640 --> 32:33.660]  Yup. Repelling.
[32:33.660 --> 32:33.720]  Repelling.
[32:36.300 --> 32:36.920]  Damn it.
[32:37.980 --> 32:38.820]  Flank around.
[32:40.200 --> 32:41.580]  A little flanksy. One at the
[32:41.580 --> 32:42.280]  repel location.
[32:43.480 --> 32:44.600]  Another one coming down the repel.
[32:46.200 --> 32:46.620]  Alright.
[32:48.620 --> 32:49.040]  Nice.
[32:49.880 --> 32:50.920]  Oh, he still got on the patio.
[32:51.120 --> 32:52.720]  I think another guy at repel as well.
[32:55.220 --> 32:57.360]  Oh, he just went
[32:57.360 --> 32:57.940]  inside the repel.
[33:02.180 --> 33:03.020]  One guy
[33:03.020 --> 33:04.420]  right next to me on patio, I think.
[33:05.600 --> 33:07.100]  Guys, there's only five people left.
[33:07.420 --> 33:09.120]  Four. Yeah. I got one of them in front
[33:09.120 --> 33:10.960]  of me. I just gotta kill... make... make
[33:11.320 --> 33:12.500]  him die. Okay.
[33:15.400 --> 33:16.540]  Oh, that's a grenade. Alright, he's dead.
[33:16.800 --> 33:18.160]  It went up in the top window. Oh, fuck.
[33:18.920 --> 33:20.180]  Alright, two more. Two more?
[33:20.660 --> 33:20.980]  Wow.
[33:22.980 --> 33:24.220]  Oh! Oh, no.
[33:24.720 --> 33:26.620]  Living room. Oh, Ray,
[33:26.680 --> 33:28.040]  behind you. Oh, yup, yup, yup. Upstairs.
[33:28.420 --> 33:28.740]  Yup, yup.
[33:32.020 --> 33:32.580]  One more!
[33:32.960 --> 33:34.760]  I'm gonna do it before the game ends.
[33:35.480 --> 33:36.740]  I think this guy's still on the patio.
[33:36.760 --> 33:37.380]  He's still on the patio.
[33:39.180 --> 33:40.000]  Oh, I got him. Sorry.
[33:41.700 --> 33:42.260]  Let's go.
[33:42.980 --> 33:44.620]  All we had to do was reminisce about
[33:44.620 --> 33:46.140]  the good old days. There you go.
[33:46.920 --> 33:48.420]  Wow, dude. Nobody died. Nice.
[33:48.620 --> 33:50.100]  That was no deaths. Perfect.
[33:50.480 --> 33:51.600]  Yo, Gavin, we carry the game. Let's go.
[33:53.460 --> 33:54.720]  I don't think I was ever
[33:55.120 --> 33:56.540]  this close to you in the leaderboard back
[33:56.540 --> 33:57.000]  in the day.
[33:58.480 --> 34:00.920]  I've fallen off. I'm 35 now.
[34:01.540 --> 34:03.000]  Well, there you have it. That's another
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.020]  what we like to call absolute
[34:05.020 --> 34:06.500]  fucking clinic
[34:06.500 --> 34:08.680]  on how to beat that level on
[34:08.680 --> 34:11.120]  Realistic. You're gonna need four of the best
[34:11.120 --> 34:12.700]  gamers on the planet Earth.
[34:12.760 --> 34:14.580]  Thanks for having me again, Geoff.
[34:14.660 --> 34:16.320]  Oh, thank you for being here. Oh, dude, no problem.
[34:16.740 --> 34:19.060]  Can I have my documentation again before I leave?
[34:19.660 --> 34:21.140]  It is weird you needed this.
[34:21.340 --> 34:22.380]  You know me.
[34:23.460 --> 34:24.540]  I'll mail it to you.
[34:25.300 --> 34:26.960]  Ray, we'll just go ahead and make
[34:26.960 --> 34:28.860]  this a weekly Thursday thing.
[34:28.860 --> 34:30.080]  So go ahead and see you next week.
[34:30.400 --> 34:32.420]  How many...
[34:33.980 --> 34:34.780]  How many
[34:34.780 --> 34:36.840]  fucking maps are there?
[34:37.060 --> 34:38.760]  Too many. I think it's like 10
[34:38.760 --> 34:39.740]  or something, maybe more.
[34:40.320 --> 34:41.820]  Because this is a mode they actually cared about.
[34:42.180 --> 34:43.620]  All the multiplayer maps.
[34:45.240 --> 34:46.640]  You have to check. I can't check.
[34:46.820 --> 34:48.380]  What if we just do two maps every year?
[34:48.940 --> 34:50.800]  Two maps a year. Two maps a year?
[34:51.100 --> 34:52.920]  Let's do it. I promise every time
[34:52.920 --> 34:54.620]  I'll get as many kills as I have eyes.
[34:54.740 --> 34:56.140]  That's my promise to you all.
[34:56.140 --> 34:57.000]  Oh god.
[34:58.380 --> 35:00.020]  Alright, that sounds good. Go ahead
[35:00.020 --> 35:02.480]  and check out our Patreon if you get a chance.
[35:02.760 --> 35:03.180]  Please do.
[35:04.400 --> 35:06.180]  Go ahead and check out Ray
[35:06.180 --> 35:08.020]  Twitch.com slash
[35:08.020 --> 35:09.520]  Twitch.tv slash Ray.
[35:09.720 --> 35:11.920]  There you go. Twitch.com slash Ray TV.
[35:12.140 --> 35:12.920]  Slash Ray is great.
[35:14.800 --> 35:16.320]  You'll find me. Just type in Ray.
[35:16.540 --> 35:17.040]  Who cares?
[35:17.520 --> 35:19.320]  That's a great get, the old slash Ray.
[35:19.780 --> 35:21.880]  It took me six years to
[35:22.620 --> 35:23.700]  argue with them to get it.
[35:23.700 --> 35:25.800]  Alright, that's it.
[35:25.960 --> 35:26.800]  Bye!
[35:27.220 --> 35:27.720]  Bye!
