[00:00.000 --> 00:04.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. This is Regulation Fights.
[00:04.760 --> 00:10.060]  It's a fight night for everyone at home and everyone here tonight.
[00:10.420 --> 00:13.600]  Guys, my screen is shared and it has begun.
[00:14.060 --> 00:15.920]  Welcome to the tribute to the troops.
[00:16.780 --> 00:18.080]  In Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:18.360 --> 00:20.580]  Yeah, yeah. Geoff, this is dedicated to you. Big salute.
[00:21.060 --> 00:21.980]  Oh, I've never been to Providence.
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.400]  Introducing first...
[00:25.400 --> 00:26.840]  Who's that?
[00:28.380 --> 00:30.540]  You know who it is. It's your dad.
[00:31.160 --> 00:31.980]  I thought it was...
[00:31.980 --> 00:35.520]  Hey guys, it's me, your father. No, it's your dad, Andrew. It's your dad, Eric.
[00:36.120 --> 00:37.220]  Look, it's your dad.
[00:37.420 --> 00:38.140]  It's dad.
[00:38.320 --> 00:38.680]  Oh.
[00:38.980 --> 00:39.620]  Your dad.
[00:40.840 --> 00:43.360]  I thought it was the guy from Bar Rescue at first.
[00:44.160 --> 00:46.380]  No, no, no. I'm your father. I'm your father.
[00:46.500 --> 00:49.140]  And I'm very disappointed in all of you and I'm here to show you...
[00:49.140 --> 00:49.300]  Yeah, I'm your dad.
[00:52.520 --> 00:54.800]  So we're simming this fight, right? Everyone's just gonna...
[00:54.800 --> 01:00.580]  Yes, yes, we are. We are simming this fight. This is a fatal five-way for a championship.
[01:01.200 --> 01:03.920]  And dad is dressed to impress.
[01:04.900 --> 01:11.120]  Well, as I say, as your father, dress for the job you want to have, not the job that you currently have.
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.780]  I'm not dressing to be a wrestler. He's dressing to be the president.
[01:18.580 --> 01:20.140]  I like his little pocket square.
[01:20.300 --> 01:20.900]  Yeah, I do too.
[01:20.900 --> 01:21.320]  He knows best.
[01:21.980 --> 01:22.220]  Wow.
[01:23.120 --> 01:28.480]  He's going to distribute a little fatherly punishment to all of you bad kids today.
[01:28.520 --> 01:29.020]  Oh, wow.
[01:29.360 --> 01:30.160]  And it's not gonna...
[01:30.160 --> 01:30.540]  Spankings all around.
[01:30.580 --> 01:33.420]  Trust me, it's gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me.
[01:33.940 --> 01:34.340]  Oh, there he is!
[01:35.220 --> 01:36.800]  His lawnmowing outfit.
[01:38.720 --> 01:41.920]  Let's see his first opponent attribute to the troops.
[01:42.320 --> 01:43.000]  Oh, no!
[01:43.620 --> 01:44.120]  Oh, shit!
[01:44.980 --> 01:45.420]  Garpole?
[01:45.960 --> 01:47.300]  It's Garpole.
[01:47.720 --> 01:48.640]  Oh, God.
[01:51.240 --> 01:52.320]  It's Garpole!
[01:52.320 --> 01:53.820]  Oh, no!
[01:55.660 --> 01:58.940]  He's got Stone Cold Steve Austin all over him.
[01:58.960 --> 02:03.220]  He's got him on his face, and he's also got another man's face on top of his face.
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.400]  Oh, my God.
[02:04.400 --> 02:05.140]  Don't worry about it.
[02:05.140 --> 02:05.750]  He's Garpole.
[02:07.720 --> 02:10.280]  I give you... that is so good.
[02:10.900 --> 02:13.100]  Yeah, that is really something.
[02:13.120 --> 02:14.340]  Did you have to remake this?
[02:14.940 --> 02:15.300]  I did.
[02:15.740 --> 02:16.340]  Oh, no!
[02:16.340 --> 02:18.360]  This game is a broken piece of shit.
[02:18.360 --> 02:19.380]  Yes, it is.
[02:19.420 --> 02:20.320]  Welcome to 2K, baby.
[02:20.920 --> 02:22.760]  For some reason, couldn't upload the first time.
[02:23.120 --> 02:23.680]  But here it is.
[02:25.180 --> 02:27.400]  I see why you were disappointed in having to go back to do it.
[02:27.540 --> 02:27.920]  Look at him.
[02:28.020 --> 02:28.480]  Call me.
[02:29.560 --> 02:34.300]  He looks like if Thanos and Grimace fucked and...
[02:34.980 --> 02:36.560]  And Steve Austin was there.
[02:37.180 --> 02:38.100]  Oh, no!
[02:38.580 --> 02:39.140]  Problematic child.
[02:39.160 --> 02:41.460]  I don't know what that thing is on his back, but it's an accident.
[02:41.660 --> 02:41.900]  I love it.
[02:42.260 --> 02:44.160]  Stop doing that.
[02:45.020 --> 02:46.560]  A Garpole I don't like.
[02:47.020 --> 02:47.460]  Garpole.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.100]  Well, we have Dad and Garpole.
[02:51.300 --> 02:53.160]  Let's see who's next in the tribute to the troops.
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.160]  Geoff, this is a tribute to you.
[02:55.940 --> 02:56.260]  Thank you.
[02:56.580 --> 02:57.520]  A tribute to Geoff.
[03:01.200 --> 03:02.200]  Next up...
[03:02.200 --> 03:02.680]  Oh, wow.
[03:02.680 --> 03:03.320]  There's the audience.
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.800]  They wait with bated breath.
[03:05.200 --> 03:07.040]  Oh, my God.
[03:07.500 --> 03:08.620]  It's Scott Wolfman.
[03:09.360 --> 03:11.620]  It's astronaut Scott Wolfman.
[03:13.320 --> 03:21.640]  From out of this world, Scott Wolfman has been setting sail across the cosmos for many years.
[03:22.020 --> 03:24.020]  Lost is Scott Wolfman.
[03:24.420 --> 03:28.760]  Scott Wolfman, an astronaut, is trying to find his way to the ring.
[03:28.860 --> 03:29.580]  This is what happens.
[03:29.700 --> 03:34.560]  He has kind of like the reverse bends where he came down from space too fast.
[03:34.720 --> 03:35.600]  He's got the straights.
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.680]  Yeah, he has the straights.
[03:37.680 --> 03:43.320]  The cosmic rays have done something dismal to Scott Wolfman.
[03:44.060 --> 03:45.760]  Astronaut, American hero.
[03:46.340 --> 03:48.100]  And Scott Wolfman...
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.080]  Yeah, he is...
[03:49.080 --> 03:50.900]  He looks out of control, Scott Wolfman.
[03:50.900 --> 03:52.260]  So now it's a fight with Geoff.
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.500]  It's a fight between Daddy and Big Daddy.
[03:55.160 --> 03:56.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:56.560 --> 03:58.760]  But, I mean, the problem...
[03:58.760 --> 04:02.820]  The problem with space is we don't know what it can do to a man.
[04:02.920 --> 04:04.080]  He looks out of control.
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.000]  Scott Wolfman looks absolutely...
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.700]  Oh no, he's a wolfman!
[04:08.800 --> 04:11.760]  The cosmic rays have turned him into a wolfman!
[04:11.780 --> 04:15.120]  You just put him in an astral suit for the entrance and it's just a wolf?
[04:15.980 --> 04:18.180]  Oh no, it's the Vancouver child kicker!
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.060]  It's the Vancouver child kicker coming down to the ring.
[04:22.240 --> 04:24.420]  Don't want to roll no ankles, I'm driving down.
[04:24.640 --> 04:25.620]  I'm being safe.
[04:25.940 --> 04:27.240]  Everybody get out of my way.
[04:28.460 --> 04:31.620]  The Vancouver child kicker looks like Shane Gillis.
[04:31.620 --> 04:36.600]  Make sure to turn it off.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.060]  The Vancouver child kicker is here to kick ass.
[04:45.300 --> 04:46.340]  Oh Christ.
[04:47.740 --> 04:48.460]  It's scary dude.
[04:48.460 --> 04:49.180]  It just kicks the lights.
[04:51.460 --> 04:54.520]  The Canadian flag is a nice touch.
[04:54.760 --> 04:55.540]  It's a nice touch.
[04:55.860 --> 04:56.700]  Oh man.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.140]  He looks like somebody else I know, but I can't quite...
[05:01.840 --> 05:03.320]  It'll come to me, it'll come to me.
[05:03.600 --> 05:07.020]  He's wearing that hood so his face is obscured so we can't really see.
[05:07.020 --> 05:08.360]  Is he the undertaker's manager?
[05:10.240 --> 05:13.720]  Who knows what the Vancouver child kicker actually does in his brief time.
[05:13.860 --> 05:17.580]  But we do know that he rides a quad down to the ring so he saves his ankles.
[05:17.860 --> 05:21.420]  Would you say that's a long back?
[05:23.820 --> 05:25.460]  Did you put all the points into kicking?
[05:26.460 --> 05:28.380]  I definitely adjusted the move set.
[05:28.380 --> 05:30.880]  And the final entrant.
[05:31.840 --> 05:34.640]  So me and Nick had a very similar idea.
[05:35.100 --> 05:40.480]  Nick is the beaster bunny and he's being accompanied to the ring by the jacked rabbit.
[05:40.620 --> 05:43.000]  My friend, spring has sprung and you're dead.
[05:43.620 --> 05:46.540]  I am so disappointed in all of my children right now.
[05:48.280 --> 05:51.140]  Well, you won't have to worry about it for too long there papa.
[05:52.720 --> 05:54.560]  Look at the beaster bunny.
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.360]  Beaster bunny baby.
[05:56.540 --> 05:57.060]  Damn.
[05:59.600 --> 06:00.400]  Holy shit.
[06:00.620 --> 06:05.120]  I made a second guy and it's so in the same vein as what Nick did.
[06:06.280 --> 06:07.860]  I went, oh, just make him the manager.
[06:08.020 --> 06:09.680]  So now me and Nick are in a tag team.
[06:09.860 --> 06:10.240]  I love it.
[06:10.420 --> 06:16.500]  But guys, it begins and it's for the Multiversal Infinite Championship.
[06:19.720 --> 06:20.620]  Did you make that?
[06:20.640 --> 06:21.480]  Here it is.
[06:24.100 --> 06:25.760]  Did you make that or is that in the game?
[06:25.960 --> 06:26.740]  Nope, it's in the game.
[06:26.760 --> 06:27.160]  Oh, all right.
[06:27.160 --> 06:30.220]  And now, this extreme rules match begins.
[06:30.440 --> 06:30.620]  Oh no.
[06:30.960 --> 06:31.960]  Dad's throwing him around.
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.420]  But here comes Scott Wolfman.
[06:33.460 --> 06:34.060]  Oh, Scott Wolf.
[06:34.540 --> 06:35.360]  Oh no, dad.
[06:35.780 --> 06:37.580]  I've got dad strength.
[06:39.220 --> 06:41.060]  Eat your vegetables.
[06:41.860 --> 06:43.160]  This is for...
[06:44.000 --> 06:44.520]  I don't know.
[06:45.060 --> 06:46.180]  I don't know.
[06:46.180 --> 06:46.600]  Take that dad.
[06:47.120 --> 06:48.540]  Man, dad is really small.
[06:50.660 --> 06:52.000]  Your ball is so big.
[06:53.220 --> 06:55.360]  You think you're old enough to take on your old man?
[06:58.340 --> 06:59.380]  Oh, yeah.
[06:59.760 --> 07:01.080]  That's right, Beaster Boy.
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.260]  No, don't pull off my dinosaur foot.
[07:03.640 --> 07:04.560]  Dad, I'm sorry.
[07:04.820 --> 07:06.540]  I'm getting Vancouver Child punched.
[07:06.780 --> 07:07.680]  This seems wrong.
[07:09.700 --> 07:11.160]  Beaster Bunny's a menace.
[07:11.280 --> 07:12.980]  Oh my god, he's just aggressive.
[07:13.480 --> 07:18.640]  So this is an extreme rules five-way elimination match.
[07:18.820 --> 07:22.220]  That means it's not first fall to the finish.
[07:22.680 --> 07:23.820]  It is an elimination.
[07:24.260 --> 07:26.040]  If you get beat, you go to the back.
[07:26.040 --> 07:27.740]  And anything goes.
[07:28.060 --> 07:32.340]  As the Vancouver Child kicker grabbed and then I think set down a football.
[07:32.920 --> 07:33.400]  I got Batman.
[07:34.280 --> 07:36.760]  Oh, I got beef with the manager apparently.
[07:37.500 --> 07:37.700]  Yeah.
[07:37.900 --> 07:38.840]  Take that, Wolfman.
[07:39.100 --> 07:39.680]  Oh no.
[07:40.460 --> 07:45.440]  Scott Wolfman, the cosmic rays have changed Scott Wolfman into a mild-mannered astronaut.
[07:45.700 --> 07:47.980]  Into this Wolfman creature that you see before you.
[07:51.240 --> 07:52.940]  I'll put him on the announcer table.
[07:55.560 --> 07:58.060]  Maybe it's because everybody in the ring is an adult.
[07:58.180 --> 08:00.420]  But I'm not seeing a lot of kicking coming from Vancouver.
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.460]  Well, you've got Wolfman a big pump kick.
[08:03.660 --> 08:08.900]  Maybe that's his full name is Vancouver Child kicker adult puncher.
[08:10.620 --> 08:15.080]  If I was just throwing kicks around, this match would only last six seconds.
[08:15.260 --> 08:16.040]  So it's my finish.
[08:16.360 --> 08:18.260]  Oh, he stopped.
[08:19.800 --> 08:21.200]  Here's a cover on dad.
[08:23.260 --> 08:24.640]  He kicks out Papa.
[08:26.900 --> 08:28.740]  That was really good form.
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.260]  Thank you.
[08:29.380 --> 08:30.400]  Just like I told you.
[08:30.640 --> 08:31.740]  Oh no, Gerpol.
[08:33.140 --> 08:34.600]  Cyclone power bomb.
[08:34.900 --> 08:36.440]  That might be it for your dad.
[08:37.120 --> 08:37.920]  My sciatica.
[08:38.800 --> 08:39.720]  I kicked out.
[08:40.400 --> 08:41.420]  He kicks out.
[08:42.100 --> 08:44.820]  Man, Vancouver Child kicker's got so little red in his bar.
[08:45.840 --> 08:46.880]  Oh shit.
[08:48.020 --> 08:50.520]  To the second rope goes Beaster Bunny.
[08:50.860 --> 08:51.920]  What does he have in mind?
[08:51.920 --> 08:52.960]  My tennis elbow.
[08:55.160 --> 08:55.980]  He did.
[08:56.100 --> 08:58.140]  Gerpol has the stairs now.
[08:58.820 --> 09:01.160]  Still got a few tricks up my old man's sleeve.
[09:01.360 --> 09:01.760]  Stairs.
[09:02.780 --> 09:03.580]  Where did I leave that?
[09:04.500 --> 09:05.860]  Oh, the steel chair.
[09:06.220 --> 09:06.540]  Daddy chair.
[09:07.140 --> 09:08.520]  Have a seat, says dad.
[09:09.080 --> 09:10.900]  Oh, Scott Wolfman.
[09:10.920 --> 09:13.800]  I'm about to teach you a thing or two about respect.
[09:15.040 --> 09:17.340]  Oh, and here's the door.
[09:17.460 --> 09:21.120]  The Vancouver Child kicker's ripped Geoff's door off of its hinges.
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.060]  That broken door is now brought into use.
[09:27.980 --> 09:29.200]  Anyone need this?
[09:29.980 --> 09:31.920]  I just found this on the floor.
[09:32.520 --> 09:34.040]  It just went around the long way.
[09:35.000 --> 09:35.640]  Oh, no.
[09:36.840 --> 09:39.320]  Scott Wolfman and the Beaster Bunny are going at it.
[09:39.440 --> 09:40.720]  Does Scott Wolfman have a tail?
[09:41.140 --> 09:42.120]  Is that what that is?
[09:42.380 --> 09:42.940]  Is what's that?
[09:43.300 --> 09:44.040]  Does he have a tail?
[09:44.600 --> 09:45.420]  Who, Scott Wolfman?
[09:45.560 --> 09:45.800]  Yeah.
[09:45.860 --> 09:47.580]  Yeah, he's a werewolf, Geoff.
[09:47.580 --> 09:48.120]  Wolf tail?
[09:48.320 --> 09:48.660]  Yeah, okay.
[09:48.820 --> 09:49.940]  Yeah, he's a werewolf.
[09:49.940 --> 09:54.160]  The cosmic radiation has been absorbed into the pendant he wears around his neck,
[09:54.320 --> 09:57.260]  and it has changed him into this wolfman creature you see before you.
[09:57.980 --> 10:00.560]  So are there other... is that a space thing, wolves?
[10:01.560 --> 10:01.980]  Well, no.
[10:02.060 --> 10:04.920]  Well, I mean, in space, you would permanently be a werewolf.
[10:05.060 --> 10:05.800]  Yeah, by the moon.
[10:06.400 --> 10:07.160]  Yeah, by the stairs.
[10:08.040 --> 10:08.740]  That's not true.
[10:10.360 --> 10:11.900]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[10:12.160 --> 10:12.660]  It slams.
[10:13.820 --> 10:14.940]  Gerpol put him down.
[10:15.100 --> 10:16.160]  Got you in the Achilles.
[10:18.180 --> 10:23.000]  Now, did one of us put the door there, or is it just where the item fell?
[10:23.880 --> 10:24.760]  No, it's just where it fell.
[10:25.040 --> 10:28.380]  But Scott Wolfman now has... it has a human arm.
[10:28.640 --> 10:29.840]  And he's throwing it at Dad!
[10:30.240 --> 10:32.100]  It looks like the BCK's arm.
[10:35.280 --> 10:37.240]  Oh no, choking out Gerpol.
[10:43.740 --> 10:44.700]  My face!
[10:44.700 --> 10:47.340]  I mean, the Vancouver Child Kicker's getting fucked up.
[10:47.880 --> 10:48.620]  Oh no.
[10:48.700 --> 10:49.700]  Oh no, Beaster Boy!
[10:50.200 --> 10:50.700]  Oh no.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.360]  Bunny! Bunny Man!
[10:54.800 --> 10:56.200]  Gerpol going for the pin!
[10:58.140 --> 10:58.620]  One...
[11:00.380 --> 11:01.920]  I thought you were gonna get him.
[11:02.120 --> 11:02.980]  What's the Jacked Rabbit doing?
[11:04.100 --> 11:08.260]  The Jacked Rabbit is accompanying the Beaster Bunny to make sure everything's on the up and up here.
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.760]  Unfortunately, it's an extreme rules match, so everything's in order,
[11:11.960 --> 11:13.680]  and there's nothing he can really do about it.
[11:13.680 --> 11:16.520]  So when you say extreme rules, what does that mean?
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.580]  It's a hardcore match.
[11:19.040 --> 11:22.820]  So the rules are extreme, or it's extreme because there are no rules?
[11:23.000 --> 11:23.560]  Can you use a gun?
[11:24.480 --> 11:27.140]  Yeah, you could. If there was a gun in the game, you could use a gun.
[11:27.260 --> 11:28.440]  Get up, Bull! Get up!
[11:28.800 --> 11:29.340]  Oh no!
[11:29.820 --> 11:31.640]  Oh, Scott Wolfman's gone down!
[11:31.840 --> 11:33.260]  The cover from Gerpol!
[11:34.160 --> 11:34.540]  One...
[11:34.540 --> 11:35.680]  He's got a lot of health still.
[11:36.720 --> 11:38.500]  We're stuck in on these two counts.
[11:39.420 --> 11:41.020]  Dad throwing me through the stairs.
[11:41.160 --> 11:42.340]  We're getting deep in this match.
[11:42.340 --> 11:45.380]  Oh shit, Dad's getting revved up!
[11:45.740 --> 11:47.620]  Dad is jacking ass.
[11:47.620 --> 11:50.260]  I'm just stretching my lower back. I have arthritis.
[11:51.460 --> 11:52.400]  Something fierce.
[11:52.720 --> 11:53.620]  Uh-oh, the guitar!
[11:54.000 --> 11:54.880]  Oh no!
[11:55.460 --> 11:56.700]  Oh my god!
[11:56.740 --> 11:57.540]  Right in my face!
[11:58.260 --> 11:58.460]  Yup.
[11:58.900 --> 12:01.060]  You knocked off my second set of eyes almost.
[12:02.200 --> 12:04.140]  Big vertical suplex to Dad.
[12:04.220 --> 12:05.420]  Oh no, the kick from the kicker!
[12:05.540 --> 12:06.660]  That might do it, the cover!
[12:08.560 --> 12:10.820]  Oh, an instant kick out.
[12:11.440 --> 12:11.720]  Yup.
[12:11.720 --> 12:13.680]  Oh, suddenly you can't stop Dad.
[12:14.040 --> 12:14.160]  Oh!
[12:14.680 --> 12:16.940]  Holy shit, you threw me on a pile!
[12:17.340 --> 12:18.160]  Bodies all over the place.
[12:18.320 --> 12:19.700]  This is an insane match.
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.660]  And a reverse scoop slam.
[12:21.840 --> 12:24.460]  Oh, he's going for the corner top rope!
[12:25.020 --> 12:26.200]  Get up, PCK!
[12:26.480 --> 12:26.760]  Yeah!
[12:27.640 --> 12:28.240]  A dodge!
[12:29.080 --> 12:31.260]  Somebody get your dad a baby aspirin. It's in my pocket.
[12:31.580 --> 12:32.540]  Here, have this aspirin.
[12:32.800 --> 12:33.080]  Wow!
[12:34.520 --> 12:36.800]  Maybe Daddy needs to give you a little bit of medicine still.
[12:37.560 --> 12:37.760]  Yeah.
[12:39.040 --> 12:39.220]  Ooh!
[12:41.420 --> 12:42.460]  That's getting real creepy.
[12:42.460 --> 12:43.440]  To your father.
[12:43.500 --> 12:44.120]  Oh God!
[12:44.360 --> 12:45.020]  Wreck his shit!
[12:46.880 --> 12:48.240]  Yeah, and your dad's creepy.
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.760]  What a combination of colors when we group up.
[12:52.160 --> 12:53.140]  It really is.
[12:53.420 --> 12:54.760]  Oh no, Scott Wolfman!
[12:55.840 --> 12:57.560]  You just baned me.
[12:58.080 --> 12:59.120]  You know, this is getting ugly.
[12:59.120 --> 13:02.160]  I feel like the Vancouver Child Kick is going all in with fists this game.
[13:02.280 --> 13:03.660]  Yeah, he's a punch guy.
[13:03.740 --> 13:04.680]  Like we said, his full name.
[13:05.040 --> 13:06.300]  He kicked Dad, though.
[13:06.480 --> 13:07.320]  I mean, look at that.
[13:07.520 --> 13:07.720]  Yeah.
[13:08.520 --> 13:09.500]  There's a bunch of knees.
[13:10.840 --> 13:13.180]  I mean, a knee is a lower body.
[13:13.520 --> 13:14.220]  It's halfway to a kick.
[13:14.240 --> 13:16.180]  A knee is halfway to a kick.
[13:17.420 --> 13:19.740]  Technically, my guy has eight eyes.
[13:20.100 --> 13:24.600]  He's got his own eyes, the fake eyes, Stone Cold Steve Austin's eyes, and two eyes on the tip of his head.
[13:24.820 --> 13:25.360]  Oh no!
[13:25.920 --> 13:26.540]  Put me down!
[13:26.880 --> 13:27.940]  Oh my God, Beaster Bunny.
[13:28.320 --> 13:29.900]  See, this is exciting.
[13:30.060 --> 13:35.000]  This is all I do when I stream is I just make the wrestlers fight each other and don't do anything.
[13:35.060 --> 13:35.540]  It's great.
[13:35.700 --> 13:36.580]  This is the best.
[13:36.580 --> 13:38.700]  This is all I want to do in this game.
[13:38.780 --> 13:40.620]  I like this more than playing it.
[13:40.760 --> 13:42.860]  Exactly. Playing this game sucks.
[13:43.520 --> 13:47.680]  Hey, 2K, if you're watching this, playing this game is not fun.
[13:48.020 --> 13:49.420]  Watching this game is a blast.
[13:50.020 --> 13:50.860]  Oh, what am I doing with Dad?
[13:50.860 --> 13:51.520]  I hate playing this game.
[13:51.600 --> 13:53.400]  I don't like what Dad's walking around.
[13:53.460 --> 13:55.040]  Man, we're just all grouped up.
[13:55.220 --> 13:55.400]  Oh!
[13:55.920 --> 13:56.740]  Ow, my legs.
[13:56.920 --> 14:00.780]  Now, in an Extreme Rules match, Eric, can we get pins outside of the ring or does it have to be in the ring?
[14:00.940 --> 14:03.740]  Pinfalls can only take place... that's the most extreme rule.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.580]  Pinfalls can only take place in the ring.
[14:05.580 --> 14:08.760]  So we're really bunched up here by the commentators.
[14:08.980 --> 14:10.680]  Oh, Dad used the guitar!
[14:11.040 --> 14:12.160]  Oh, Dad, you killed him!
[14:12.380 --> 14:13.820]  Oh, we might have a pin situation.
[14:14.640 --> 14:15.300]  Uh-oh.
[14:15.660 --> 14:16.780]  Oh, a charge finisher!
[14:17.020 --> 14:18.560]  Scott Wolfman with a spear!
[14:19.020 --> 14:19.680]  Oh, the spear!
[14:21.480 --> 14:23.780]  Scott Wolfman is feeling it.
[14:23.900 --> 14:26.080]  One, two...
[14:26.080 --> 14:26.540]  Oh, no.
[14:26.720 --> 14:27.060]  Three!
[14:27.640 --> 14:28.900]  Paul is out!
[14:29.140 --> 14:31.060]  Paul has been eliminated.
[14:32.060 --> 14:32.820]  Good job, Scottie.
[14:32.860 --> 14:33.880]  Daddy's proud of you.
[14:34.020 --> 14:35.260]  You made your father proud.
[14:35.260 --> 14:36.900]  A win for you is a win for Dad.
[14:37.260 --> 14:39.280]  That's the power of Scott Wolfman!
[14:40.900 --> 14:41.640]  Oh, no.
[14:42.480 --> 14:42.680]  Oh!
[14:43.120 --> 14:44.140]  Gurpaul's going to the box.
[14:44.800 --> 14:45.660]  Yeah, he's out of here.
[14:47.920 --> 14:48.880]  Yeah, he's...
[14:48.880 --> 14:58.240]  Dreams of holding a championship here in regulation wrestling have shafted him once again as Gurpaul has to go all the way to the back.
[14:58.320 --> 14:59.420]  The loneliest walk.
[14:59.640 --> 15:00.560]  Gavin's gonna spin it.
[15:00.680 --> 15:01.560]  My controller turned off.
[15:01.620 --> 15:02.520]  My controller turned off.
[15:03.300 --> 15:05.180]  Gavin's gonna spend another night crying.
[15:05.180 --> 15:06.480]  In the fucking locker room.
[15:06.600 --> 15:06.820]  Yep.
[15:08.220 --> 15:10.100]  Oh, Dad tripping over.
[15:12.200 --> 15:13.280]  Pulling a hamstring.
[15:14.520 --> 15:21.840]  The beaster bunny being accompanied to the ring by the jacked rabbit who's giving his friend, his tag team partner, space to work.
[15:22.220 --> 15:23.320]  Oh, I don't want to be in there.
[15:23.540 --> 15:24.640]  I could be pinned in there.
[15:25.940 --> 15:26.440]  Oh.
[15:26.440 --> 15:27.980]  Oh, it's the duel coming back into play.
[15:28.180 --> 15:28.400]  Dad!
[15:28.480 --> 15:28.820]  Oh!
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.140]  I love the Vancouver tan on the VCK.
[15:32.280 --> 15:32.560]  Yeah.
[15:32.920 --> 15:33.120]  Yeah.
[15:33.760 --> 15:35.400]  Oh, Dad has the football.
[15:35.540 --> 15:37.280]  Let's play a little catch, son.
[15:38.120 --> 15:38.760]  That's right.
[15:39.780 --> 15:40.840]  I'm gonna show you form.
[15:41.060 --> 15:42.100]  This is how you throw a spiral.
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.220]  Where is VCK taking Dad?
[15:46.360 --> 15:48.980]  Dad kind of looks like the cool pirate if he retired.
[15:49.760 --> 15:50.900]  No, no.
[15:51.160 --> 15:51.780]  The cool pirate was tall.
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.680]  He was missing an eye.
[15:53.820 --> 15:54.060]  He was...
[15:54.060 --> 15:55.160]  What a chair throw.
[15:55.420 --> 15:56.540]  He had a strong chin.
[15:57.060 --> 15:58.480]  What a throw by the beaster bunny.
[15:58.480 --> 15:59.480]  Dad is only 5'4".
[15:59.480 --> 15:59.900]  No, Dad!
[16:00.240 --> 16:00.680]  Wow!
[16:00.680 --> 16:02.380]  Look at the Dad strength.
[16:02.380 --> 16:03.040]  That's right.
[16:03.240 --> 16:04.400]  Uh-oh.
[16:04.640 --> 16:05.060]  Uh-oh.
[16:05.620 --> 16:08.240]  Beaster bunny is looking to end this against Scott Wolfman.
[16:08.980 --> 16:10.940]  Mr. Wolfman.
[16:11.380 --> 16:15.100]  Acclaimed American astronaut Scott Wolfman is in trouble.
[16:15.480 --> 16:17.360]  The beaster bunny sizing him up.
[16:18.220 --> 16:19.480]  Kick to the midsection.
[16:20.480 --> 16:21.680]  The 360!
[16:23.500 --> 16:25.520]  Powerbomb in the middle of the ring!
[16:26.340 --> 16:27.060]  One!
[16:27.340 --> 16:28.060]  Two!
[16:28.920 --> 16:30.580]  Oh my God!
[16:30.580 --> 16:33.580]  The Wolfman has been sent back to space!
[16:34.720 --> 16:36.180]  Good job, Beastie.
[16:36.340 --> 16:37.060]  What the hell?
[16:37.700 --> 16:38.080]  Thanks, Papa.
[16:38.600 --> 16:39.360]  Round him!
[16:41.940 --> 16:42.280]  Oh!
[16:45.900 --> 16:47.760]  Beaster bunny taking Dad out.
[16:48.060 --> 16:50.560]  This is a five-star match, baby.
[16:54.100 --> 16:54.860]  Don't worry, kids.
[16:54.960 --> 16:55.720]  Dad will be up in a second.
[16:55.820 --> 16:57.080]  I just feel it in the machine splits.
[16:57.300 --> 16:57.740]  Look out, Dad!
[16:57.780 --> 16:58.240]  Take that, Dad!
[16:59.230 --> 17:01.420]  He put some funny angle on that.
[17:02.200 --> 17:03.800]  Vancouver child diver.
[17:04.280 --> 17:05.020]  No!
[17:06.860 --> 17:08.180]  My ankle!
[17:12.800 --> 17:15.240]  Oh, no. Beaster bunny.
[17:15.240 --> 17:16.460]  He's got the chair.
[17:16.720 --> 17:17.320]  Bad intentions here.
[17:17.500 --> 17:17.700]  Oh!
[17:19.320 --> 17:21.220]  Kick him, kick him, kick him!
[17:23.700 --> 17:25.140]  That's a light tube!
[17:25.900 --> 17:26.380]  Bam!
[17:26.380 --> 17:27.560]  Glass everywhere!
[17:28.900 --> 17:29.480]  Mercury poisoning.
[17:30.400 --> 17:32.040]  It's in my lungs!
[17:34.280 --> 17:34.760]  Oh, Dad!
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.480]  He kicked him on the way down!
[17:36.680 --> 17:38.160]  PCK's just hitting everybody.
[17:40.080 --> 17:41.760]  Did you just karate pose me?
[17:41.880 --> 17:42.560]  I believe I did.
[17:43.980 --> 17:45.460]  It's down to three.
[17:46.040 --> 17:49.000]  The Beaster bunny, Vancouver child kicker, and Dad.
[17:52.320 --> 17:53.920]  I'm gonna be so sore tomorrow.
[17:56.380 --> 17:56.580]  Oh, no!
[17:57.020 --> 17:57.980]  Is that a taunt?
[17:59.080 --> 18:00.800]  No, you eat your vegetables, Dad!
[18:00.960 --> 18:02.060]  You eat those carrots!
[18:03.620 --> 18:07.720]  Those educated feet coming into play from Vancouver child kicker.
[18:08.480 --> 18:10.600]  You did this already, Beaster bunny. Stop it!
[18:11.600 --> 18:12.140]  Get him!
[18:12.460 --> 18:14.240]  The back and forth into the barricade.
[18:14.480 --> 18:15.520]  No, watch out for Dad!
[18:17.840 --> 18:19.420]  They're both coming for me!
[18:21.960 --> 18:24.580]  No, he's fired up.
[18:24.860 --> 18:25.780]  Dad's feeling it.
[18:25.780 --> 18:28.140]  Dad just learned that there's a cookout on the weekend.
[18:29.620 --> 18:30.540]  Uh-oh, Papa.
[18:31.300 --> 18:31.780]  Oh, shit!
[18:32.320 --> 18:34.180]  I'm about to grill some respect into you, son.
[18:34.740 --> 18:35.700]  Ooh, that was close.
[18:35.860 --> 18:37.900]  Is he wearing, like, Birkenstocks?
[18:38.700 --> 18:41.000]  Yeah, yeah, he's wearing socks and sandals.
[18:41.840 --> 18:44.300]  Gotta let my Beaster bunny breathe on the weekend.
[18:45.120 --> 18:46.360]  He's showing off, man, big time.
[18:47.240 --> 18:51.400]  He does not see Vancouver child kicker as a threat here at all.
[18:51.820 --> 18:53.040]  Oh, no, where's he kicking him?
[18:53.200 --> 18:53.980]  Into the audience!
[18:53.980 --> 18:55.900]  Oh, going into the stands?
[18:56.160 --> 18:56.560]  Oh!
[18:59.600 --> 19:03.600]  Oh, Dad hit him in the bull!
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.680]  I don't have any hair to cushion that.
[19:05.920 --> 19:06.380]  Yeah.
[19:09.460 --> 19:12.020]  Oh, kicking the Beaster bunny in the face.
[19:14.120 --> 19:15.840]  On the table here.
[19:15.980 --> 19:16.880]  Right in the sharp spot.
[19:17.000 --> 19:23.260]  I think this is gonna be, after the next big move, it's gonna be a race to get someone in the ring to get an elimination.
[19:25.200 --> 19:25.580]  Oh!
[19:28.320 --> 19:28.860]  Oh, God.
[19:29.040 --> 19:30.220]  Dad's just getting tossed around.
[19:30.380 --> 19:31.360]  I'm pretending to be hurt.
[19:32.200 --> 19:33.080]  Oh, good. Cricket my neck.
[19:33.160 --> 19:33.500]  Nice pretend.
[19:33.660 --> 19:33.900]  Shit!
[19:33.980 --> 19:34.480]  Oh, my God.
[19:34.700 --> 19:35.080]  Oh!
[19:37.640 --> 19:38.020]  God!
[19:38.660 --> 19:40.080]  Just keep me out of the ring!
[19:42.640 --> 19:44.960]  The Beaster bunny is dominating here.
[19:45.080 --> 19:45.840]  Look at the power!
[19:46.720 --> 19:49.380]  We're in the deep water here.
[19:50.480 --> 19:51.440]  Oh, the finisher!
[19:51.700 --> 19:52.200]  You had it in you.
[19:52.620 --> 19:53.200]  Oh, no.
[19:54.060 --> 19:56.400]  The 360 Beaster bomb!
[19:56.580 --> 19:57.580]  You always said I was hard-headed.
[19:59.220 --> 20:00.960]  But Dad's on the outside.
[20:01.960 --> 20:03.860]  He might be down and out of this match.
[20:03.960 --> 20:05.380]  What the hell is he thinking here?
[20:05.580 --> 20:05.800]  Uh-oh.
[20:05.900 --> 20:06.320]  Oh, no!
[20:06.840 --> 20:09.220]  I don't think the Beaster bunny knows how to end this match.
[20:10.900 --> 20:13.160]  Is he more Beast than Bunny?
[20:13.340 --> 20:14.300]  I'm afraid so.
[20:15.340 --> 20:17.000]  In the Vancouver Child Kicker.
[20:18.960 --> 20:21.460]  Dire intentions with the boot to the face.
[20:21.660 --> 20:21.840]  No!
[20:21.840 --> 20:23.440]  There's no way this will be enough.
[20:23.760 --> 20:23.900]  Two.
[20:25.060 --> 20:25.480]  Oh!
[20:26.640 --> 20:30.180]  He thought a single kick would put down the Beaster bunny.
[20:30.620 --> 20:33.160]  Dad is just casually walking around outside.
[20:33.600 --> 20:34.220]  Oh, no!
[20:35.280 --> 20:35.820]  Oh, no!
[20:36.080 --> 20:37.640]  I'm checking out the foundation for cracks.
[20:37.820 --> 20:38.960]  Somebody needs to water this thing.
[20:39.720 --> 20:41.040]  You know it gets hot here.
[20:42.060 --> 20:42.620]  One!
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.120]  The cover!
[20:44.700 --> 20:45.260]  Oh!
[20:45.780 --> 20:46.760]  Kick out!
[20:47.600 --> 20:50.500]  And Dad taking advantage of Beaster bunny.
[20:50.500 --> 20:52.260]  And now taking advantage of...
[20:52.260 --> 20:52.720]  Uh-oh.
[20:52.800 --> 20:53.280]  Oh, no!
[20:53.520 --> 20:55.840]  Dad is setting up for something dangerous here.
[20:57.820 --> 20:59.220]  Pop him up to put him down.
[20:59.300 --> 20:59.660]  Hop!
[21:04.400 --> 21:05.800]  Kicker has been eliminated!
[21:07.460 --> 21:08.280]  That's right!
[21:08.640 --> 21:10.400]  Dad's still on top, son.
[21:10.580 --> 21:11.760]  What did I tell you?
[21:12.840 --> 21:16.240]  The Beaster bunny and Dad now fighting at ringside.
[21:16.920 --> 21:18.080]  Right hands exchanged.
[21:19.760 --> 21:21.220]  Back and forth.
[21:22.080 --> 21:23.900]  Oh, that's a dangerous place.
[21:23.900 --> 21:25.760]  A dangerous place to be.
[21:26.220 --> 21:26.780]  This is bad.
[21:26.800 --> 21:28.000]  Neither of them have finishers.
[21:29.180 --> 21:30.140]  Oh, but the taunt.
[21:31.320 --> 21:32.090]  Yeah, I can feel...
[21:32.420 --> 21:33.720]  Dad is feeling it here.
[21:33.960 --> 21:35.040]  Yeah, I got a...
[21:35.040 --> 21:35.780]  That's my tennis elbow.
[21:35.960 --> 21:37.700]  I hope you're ready for me to lay some eggs.
[21:38.400 --> 21:39.200]  The reversal!
[21:39.740 --> 21:40.780]  Taking him down!
[21:41.060 --> 21:41.680]  Oh, the quick cover!
[21:42.160 --> 21:42.500]  No rope breaks!
[21:42.500 --> 21:43.600]  Oh, what am I doing to my son?
[21:43.840 --> 21:44.000]  One!
[21:44.000 --> 21:44.460]  He's coming!
[21:45.040 --> 21:45.840]  Oh, wait!
[21:45.900 --> 21:46.820]  He flipped it over!
[21:48.180 --> 21:48.600]  One!
[21:48.840 --> 21:49.440]  That was horrendous!
[21:49.480 --> 21:49.780]  Two!
[21:50.080 --> 21:51.100]  That's not gonna happen!
[21:51.880 --> 21:53.140]  That was some planet Earth shit.
[21:54.360 --> 21:55.440]  Oh, my God.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.400]  Look at the strength!
[21:57.420 --> 21:58.620]  No, no, no, no, no.
[21:58.620 --> 22:00.280]  Up above the boards!
[22:00.560 --> 22:01.560]  Into the sky!
[22:01.900 --> 22:02.300]  We got...
[22:02.300 --> 22:02.620]  Oh!
[22:03.360 --> 22:05.100]  Face first goes down.
[22:06.120 --> 22:07.640]  I'm gonna need a cortisone shot.
[22:08.320 --> 22:09.280]  Off the ropes.
[22:09.920 --> 22:10.160]  Oh!
[22:11.160 --> 22:13.700]  Taking a page out of the Vancouver Child Kickers book.
[22:13.960 --> 22:15.280]  Does anyone have any Arnica?
[22:15.600 --> 22:16.420]  I need Arnica.
[22:17.800 --> 22:20.880]  Do you think the guys in the crowd behind the door are pissed that they can't see?
[22:21.300 --> 22:21.920]  Oh, absolutely.
[22:24.780 --> 22:26.480]  Down with the run, into the ropes.
[22:26.620 --> 22:27.000]  Oh, no!
[22:27.180 --> 22:28.100]  Dropping down.
[22:28.580 --> 22:30.100]  Up and over goes Mr. Bunny.
[22:30.340 --> 22:30.540]  Oh!
[22:30.940 --> 22:32.100]  Big back elbow.
[22:32.260 --> 22:32.820]  Oh, what am I doing?
[22:32.900 --> 22:36.820]  Conferring with the Jacked Rabbit and something dangerous in mind here.
[22:36.980 --> 22:39.800]  The stairs are coming into play.
[22:39.800 --> 22:40.160]  Oh, God.
[22:40.300 --> 22:41.600]  They're not supposed to be in there.
[22:42.280 --> 22:44.100]  He has one of those for his bath at home.
[22:46.240 --> 22:47.360]  Belly to back relief!
[22:47.700 --> 22:49.700]  Oh, the German Suplex, but he hangs on.
[22:51.040 --> 22:51.920]  Ripcord Lariat!
[22:52.240 --> 22:53.080]  Oh, my Lord.
[22:53.080 --> 22:54.180]  Here's the cover.
[22:54.180 --> 22:54.660]  Here we go, baby!
[22:54.900 --> 22:55.260]  One!
[22:55.720 --> 22:56.200]  Two!
[22:56.400 --> 22:56.840]  Two!
[22:57.660 --> 22:59.140]  The Beaster Bunny wins!
[23:00.300 --> 23:01.780]  That's right, son, you did it.
[23:01.840 --> 23:03.360]  You finally beat your old man.
[23:03.620 --> 23:04.100]  Congratulations.
[23:04.580 --> 23:05.500]  I couldn't be prouder.
[23:05.620 --> 23:06.720]  I'm going to wipe a tear off.
[23:07.620 --> 23:10.580]  Beaster Bunny is feeling it, and there's his championship.
[23:11.000 --> 23:11.440]  Yeah!
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.820]  You know, they say parents don't pick favorites in their kids, but I think it's pretty clear that we do.
[23:18.280 --> 23:19.460]  What a match.
[23:20.500 --> 23:20.680]  Wow.
[23:20.680 --> 23:23.320]  That was an incredible match.
[23:23.420 --> 23:26.600]  The greatest of all time, in fact.
[23:28.040 --> 23:34.420]  Incredible showing for the Beaster Bunny as he becomes the first regulation champion.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.020]  Congratulations to the Beaster Bunny.
[23:37.120 --> 23:38.520]  How are you feeling about that?
[23:38.740 --> 23:39.540]  Feeling great.
[23:39.720 --> 23:41.920]  Everybody, check under your seats for some chocolate eggs.
[23:41.940 --> 23:42.180]  What?
[23:44.300 --> 23:50.060]  I'm proud of one son, disappointed in a couple others, and I'm excited for the rematch.
[23:50.060 --> 23:51.660]  Yeah, I think dad's going to get his revenge.
[23:51.960 --> 23:52.540]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[23:52.640 --> 24:01.000]  That was an extreme rules match, but we can do a ladder match or up the stakes with a little TLC.
[24:01.520 --> 24:11.900]  Tables, ladders, and chairs, where Nick's Beaster Bunny will put his championship on the line, hung 15 feet in the air.
[24:12.540 --> 24:15.960]  The Beaster Bunny puts his title on the line.
[24:16.080 --> 24:18.140]  I have a way for this to go even faster.
[24:18.140 --> 24:20.480]  This is going to be crazy.
[24:20.880 --> 24:22.560]  No time limit, absolutely.
[24:22.880 --> 24:25.440]  Finishers, three, health, medium.
[24:26.280 --> 24:27.180]  Now it's time.
[24:27.360 --> 24:28.660]  Let's get these kendo sticks out of here.
[24:28.980 --> 24:34.340]  Let's add a shoe and an apple.
[24:34.820 --> 24:35.680]  Can we add a cone?
[24:36.000 --> 24:36.780]  Apple and a cone?
[24:36.880 --> 24:37.220]  Yeah.
[24:38.280 --> 24:38.760]  Oh, we should.
[24:38.800 --> 24:40.420]  Okay, I'll get rid of the shoe and I'll put the cone.
[24:40.660 --> 24:41.100]  There we go.
[24:41.620 --> 24:43.200]  The Cosmic Crisp is in this match.
[24:43.580 --> 24:44.100]  Love it.
[24:44.400 --> 24:45.280]  Oh, shit.
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.240]  Now, Geoff, last time it was tribute to the troops in honor of you.
[24:49.340 --> 24:50.000]  I appreciate that.
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.200]  Yeah, man, no problem.
[24:51.320 --> 24:53.100]  But I think we're taking it all the way back.
[24:53.160 --> 24:57.680]  I think we gotta go all the way back to WCW Fall Brawl War Games.
[24:58.240 --> 25:01.800]  This is where this five-way match is going to take place.
[25:03.360 --> 25:09.560]  Excited to see the Beaster Bunny putting his title on the line.
[25:09.560 --> 25:15.660]  Dad is ready to take on his sons as Gerpal.
[25:18.340 --> 25:19.500]  Let's see.
[25:19.620 --> 25:20.580]  Scott Wolfman.
[25:23.160 --> 25:24.820]  In his second attire.
[25:27.400 --> 25:29.120]  And who's the other one?
[25:29.240 --> 25:30.520]  The Vancouver Child Kickers.
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.340]  VCK is here.
[25:33.640 --> 25:33.960]  Sneaking around.
[25:34.520 --> 25:36.340]  Entrances are off.
[25:36.720 --> 25:37.560]  Title match.
[25:37.960 --> 25:38.580]  Absolutely.
[25:38.580 --> 25:42.400]  Guys, we are ready to select this championship.
[25:42.900 --> 25:49.020]  The Beaster Bunny's Multiversal Infinite Cardboard Championship will be on the line.
[25:49.520 --> 25:51.080]  It's Fall Brawl.
[25:51.400 --> 25:53.740]  It's Regulation and it's TLC.
[25:54.200 --> 25:55.200]  And it starts right now.
[25:57.480 --> 25:59.680]  This is a throwback.
[26:00.720 --> 26:03.860]  This is a great look for Regulation.
[26:03.860 --> 26:09.460]  As Scott Wolfman, in his deep-sea diving suit, where he's an astronaut, grabs a chair.
[26:10.880 --> 26:12.900]  Do you think the helmet is an advantage or a disadvantage?
[26:13.620 --> 26:16.920]  I think he thinks that the elevation is so high.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.640]  Again, he's dealing with wolf brain.
[26:18.980 --> 26:20.540]  So that's very high to him.
[26:20.720 --> 26:22.540]  And he's worried the air is going to get thin.
[26:22.680 --> 26:25.800]  He has circulating air within that suit.
[26:27.420 --> 26:27.920]  Oh no.
[26:28.100 --> 26:28.540]  Gerpal.
[26:29.380 --> 26:30.540]  Out the gate.
[26:30.540 --> 26:32.040]  Oh, the slam.
[26:33.040 --> 26:34.320]  Huge Beaster Bomb.
[26:34.460 --> 26:35.260]  And this is what I'm talking about.
[26:35.320 --> 26:36.640]  This is why it's going to go fast.
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.020]  Giving everyone lower health and more finishers.
[26:40.220 --> 26:41.680]  Gerpal is already going for it.
[26:41.680 --> 26:42.060]  Look at this.
[26:42.080 --> 26:42.920]  Give me the bag.
[26:43.700 --> 26:45.580]  You climb to the top of the championship.
[26:45.840 --> 26:46.340]  Oh my God.
[26:47.920 --> 26:49.080]  What a dive.
[26:49.200 --> 26:50.280]  Oh my God.
[26:50.660 --> 26:51.160]  Go VCK.
[26:51.500 --> 26:52.780]  No, no.
[26:53.100 --> 26:53.460]  Oh no.
[26:53.460 --> 26:54.220]  My lower back.
[26:54.340 --> 26:54.860]  Oh no.
[26:54.860 --> 26:55.100]  Oh no.
[26:55.220 --> 27:01.420]  He went long back first, baby.
[27:01.680 --> 27:01.960]  Uh oh.
[27:02.900 --> 27:05.040]  A table has entered the...
[27:05.680 --> 27:06.400]  It's all legal.
[27:06.680 --> 27:06.920]  Ring?
[27:06.980 --> 27:07.900]  It's all legal.
[27:08.820 --> 27:08.860]  Chair.
[27:12.680 --> 27:15.920]  This is a chair from the barbecue you didn't invite me to, Dad.
[27:17.860 --> 27:20.460]  I told you I invited you via email.
[27:21.620 --> 27:23.640]  You didn't get my e-vite, son?
[27:25.520 --> 27:27.900]  Oh, no one home for Gerpal.
[27:28.240 --> 27:29.340]  Vancouver Child Kickers.
[27:29.380 --> 27:31.880]  I said everybody was welcome in the LinkedIn post.
[27:33.160 --> 27:33.600]  Oh no.
[27:34.240 --> 27:35.000]  Oh no.
[27:35.020 --> 27:35.520]  VCK.
[27:37.760 --> 27:38.600]  Beaster Bomb.
[27:41.840 --> 27:43.560]  You know, I had an idea.
[27:44.400 --> 27:46.260]  Remind me to tell you guys I had an idea later.
[27:46.620 --> 27:46.820]  Okay.
[27:46.900 --> 27:47.540]  Okay, you got it.
[27:47.920 --> 27:50.020]  Oh, big spear on Dad taking him down.
[27:51.800 --> 27:52.780]  Sorry, Dad.
[27:53.300 --> 27:53.940]  Kids only.
[27:58.560 --> 28:01.280]  Dad, this is 90s Nickelodeon where kids rule.
[28:01.620 --> 28:02.100]  Oh, no.
[28:03.820 --> 28:06.760]  You can rule when you pay rent in my house.
[28:08.660 --> 28:10.720]  My roof, my rules.
[28:11.780 --> 28:12.680]  Oh, choking Gerpal.
[28:12.840 --> 28:13.020]  Damn.
[28:13.200 --> 28:13.680]  Oh, no.
[28:15.320 --> 28:16.660]  Beaster Bunny with the stairs?
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.760]  Homer Simpson taught a generation to do it.
[28:19.240 --> 28:19.780]  Be careful.
[28:20.100 --> 28:22.040]  My top eyes are going to go up your ass.
[28:23.460 --> 28:23.980]  Oh!
[28:25.040 --> 28:25.840]  Huge jackknife.
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.020]  Dude, VCK is going straight for this thing again?
[28:31.640 --> 28:32.440]  Climb it.
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.120]  No, drop kick.
[28:35.240 --> 28:35.920]  That's a pretty cool drop kick.
[28:36.160 --> 28:37.920]  That was a double kick by VCK.
[28:38.400 --> 28:38.860]  Oh, no.
[28:39.140 --> 28:39.740]  Oh, he missed.
[28:39.860 --> 28:40.600]  He's got to do something.
[28:40.800 --> 28:42.060]  Somebody stop that man.
[28:42.340 --> 28:43.000]  Tip that thing.
[28:43.020 --> 28:44.100]  Go, go, go, go, VCK.
[28:44.940 --> 28:46.000]  I'm reaching for it.
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.260]  I'm reaching for my thingies.
[28:47.420 --> 28:48.740]  Oh, it landed on Dad's head.
[28:48.940 --> 28:50.480]  Oh, he might be dead.
[28:50.720 --> 28:51.140]  He might be dead.
[28:51.140 --> 28:52.200]  Crushed my head in.
[28:53.640 --> 28:56.180]  Look at the strength of Scott Wolfman.
[28:57.740 --> 28:58.860]  American astronaut.
[29:01.180 --> 29:02.000]  Oh, no.
[29:02.900 --> 29:04.420]  Oh, the beast bunny.
[29:06.380 --> 29:08.540]  Putting Dad to the table and a ladder?
[29:10.360 --> 29:13.360]  I don't know if Daddy's going to finish second this time.
[29:15.620 --> 29:17.580]  VCK distracted on the outside.
[29:17.780 --> 29:18.880]  Dad is down in the ring.
[29:19.060 --> 29:20.340]  Gerpol is down also.
[29:20.340 --> 29:22.060]  This could be Scott Wolfman.
[29:22.060 --> 29:23.140]  He's throwing the table around.
[29:23.420 --> 29:25.240]  This could be Scott Wolfman's chance.
[29:25.480 --> 29:26.180]  Oh, he's got Apple.
[29:26.520 --> 29:28.620]  Oh, VCK busted open.
[29:30.720 --> 29:32.940]  The Cosmic Crisp giving him life.
[29:38.440 --> 29:39.400]  Scott, come on.
[29:39.400 --> 29:40.200]  It looks like the title moved.
[29:40.960 --> 29:42.320]  He's climbing down sad.
[29:42.580 --> 29:43.740]  Why is he climbing down?
[29:44.140 --> 29:45.640]  He climbed down so sad.
[29:45.740 --> 29:47.300]  Didn't the belt move up above?
[29:47.360 --> 29:49.340]  It looked like it took a different angle when he swiped it.
[29:49.340 --> 29:50.980]  It goes back and forth.
[29:50.980 --> 29:51.980]  Oh, no.
[29:52.080 --> 29:53.120]  Oh, Dad.
[29:54.580 --> 30:05.240]  Dude, Scott Wolfman's going nuts.
[30:05.380 --> 30:07.000]  Scott Wolfman is out for vengeance.
[30:11.020 --> 30:13.200]  This could be your chance, Scott.
[30:13.360 --> 30:15.300]  The Cosmic Rays have given him super strength.
[30:15.300 --> 30:19.440]  I just realized that we all came into existence because of Dad's finisher.
[30:22.180 --> 30:24.520]  The super kick to Scott Wolfman.
[30:24.660 --> 30:25.160]  Oh, no.
[30:25.680 --> 30:27.400]  Another... I love setting up ladders.
[30:27.900 --> 30:29.160]  Gerpol has the Apple.
[30:29.680 --> 30:30.200]  He's going.
[30:30.740 --> 30:31.880]  Gerpol, get him.
[30:32.000 --> 30:32.520]  Use the Apple.
[30:32.560 --> 30:33.580]  He dropped the Apple.
[30:34.020 --> 30:35.380]  Turn around, you damn fool.
[30:35.780 --> 30:37.520]  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[30:37.660 --> 30:38.920]  Push the fucking ladder.
[30:39.620 --> 30:40.480]  Damn it.
[30:40.980 --> 30:41.480]  Oh, no.
[30:42.540 --> 30:43.860]  The agility of Gerpol.
[30:43.860 --> 30:44.360]  The Apple.
[30:45.320 --> 30:46.200]  Oh, there it is.
[30:46.880 --> 30:48.180]  Don't throw me on the Apple.
[30:50.600 --> 30:51.400]  Apple crush.
[30:51.580 --> 30:53.100]  A little slip action there.
[30:53.260 --> 30:54.340]  We made an Apple pie.
[30:55.800 --> 30:57.560]  It's in my ass right now.
[30:58.260 --> 30:59.320]  Gerpol's got Apple in his ass.
[30:59.700 --> 31:00.020]  Oh, no.
[31:00.400 --> 31:01.180]  Dad's had enough.
[31:01.240 --> 31:02.220]  He's cleaning out these gutters.
[31:02.440 --> 31:04.260]  I don't think Dad put the ladder in the right place.
[31:05.140 --> 31:06.200]  Oh, I don't think it's going to matter.
[31:06.600 --> 31:07.240]  Here comes Gerpol.
[31:07.480 --> 31:08.480]  Oh, no, Dad.
[31:09.380 --> 31:11.780]  The Beaster Buddy taking advantage of the situation.
[31:11.800 --> 31:12.540]  Oh, go, baby.
[31:12.540 --> 31:13.180]  Get your belt back.
[31:13.180 --> 31:14.600]  Is he going to defend his belt?
[31:15.020 --> 31:16.140]  Get your belt, fool.
[31:16.260 --> 31:16.720]  Grab it.
[31:17.580 --> 31:18.080]  Oh, no.
[31:18.460 --> 31:19.200]  Grab it.
[31:19.700 --> 31:20.120]  Grab it.
[31:20.600 --> 31:21.000]  Grab it.
[31:21.160 --> 31:22.460]  Can no one stop him?
[31:22.820 --> 31:23.900]  He's up to two.
[31:24.220 --> 31:24.340]  Oh.
[31:24.640 --> 31:24.760]  Oh.
[31:25.620 --> 31:26.120]  Oh.
[31:27.100 --> 31:28.240]  Fucking butt punches.
[31:29.000 --> 31:29.140]  Oh.
[31:29.140 --> 31:29.520]  Oh.
[31:29.860 --> 31:30.080]  Oh.
[31:30.080 --> 31:31.560]  Oh, the miss with the chair.
[31:31.920 --> 31:32.440]  Spin move.
[31:32.940 --> 31:33.340]  Yes.
[31:33.680 --> 31:35.140]  No, turn around, you damn fool.
[31:35.140 --> 31:35.440]  Oh, no, Gerpol.
[31:35.620 --> 31:36.120]  Wolfman.
[31:36.840 --> 31:37.340]  Wolfman.
[31:37.640 --> 31:38.480]  Taking back to your planet.
[31:39.980 --> 31:41.320]  Oh, he's at two now.
[31:41.320 --> 31:42.880]  Dad, push, push, Dad.
[31:42.900 --> 31:43.440]  There he goes.
[31:43.780 --> 31:44.280]  Yes, Dad.
[31:49.750 --> 31:51.410]  Oh, Oklahoma Stampede.
[31:52.790 --> 31:53.230]  Oh, no.
[31:53.570 --> 31:54.370]  Oh, no.
[31:54.850 --> 31:56.810]  You know how your dad got so strong?
[31:57.050 --> 31:59.710]  Lifting bags of mulch on the weekend because she won't help.
[32:01.810 --> 32:02.390]  Oh, Gerpol.
[32:02.630 --> 32:03.210]  Get back in there.
[32:03.350 --> 32:04.510]  No VGK.
[32:04.910 --> 32:08.030]  To go back to his home planet with the championship.
[32:08.390 --> 32:08.810]  Oh, no.
[32:09.530 --> 32:09.990]  They've lost.
[32:11.330 --> 32:13.330]  Why are you so bad at grabbing that?
[32:13.750 --> 32:15.550]  Yeah, why are they all so stupid?
[32:19.770 --> 32:20.170]  Oh.
[32:20.830 --> 32:21.970]  The Beaster Bunny.
[32:22.170 --> 32:24.810]  I think he's, uh, he's defending this title.
[32:24.810 --> 32:25.590]  Oh, they're fighting over the ladder.
[32:25.730 --> 32:26.430]  He's got a lot of health.
[32:26.530 --> 32:26.910]  Oh, no.
[32:27.170 --> 32:27.550]  Oh, no.
[32:27.750 --> 32:28.170]  Come on.
[32:28.590 --> 32:29.590]  Come on, Dad, help me.
[32:30.670 --> 32:31.470]  Double underhook.
[32:31.750 --> 32:31.970]  Oh.
[32:35.830 --> 32:37.750]  Gerpol taking advantage again.
[32:39.250 --> 32:40.030]  Oh, nice kick.
[32:40.570 --> 32:41.010]  Don't kick me.
[32:41.590 --> 32:42.990]  How does it feel, VGK?
[32:43.330 --> 32:45.210]  Oh, he can't let that happen.
[32:45.270 --> 32:46.190]  Oh, no.
[32:46.390 --> 32:47.250]  Oh, God.
[32:47.350 --> 32:48.270]  My back.
[32:48.450 --> 32:49.030]  Oh, no.
[32:49.130 --> 32:50.350]  Why are you taking me?
[32:50.650 --> 32:51.490]  He's getting the foul.
[32:52.770 --> 32:53.370]  Gerpol.
[32:53.830 --> 32:55.230]  We gotta stop Gerpol.
[32:55.710 --> 32:55.930]  No.
[32:56.030 --> 32:56.470]  No.
[32:56.930 --> 32:56.970]  No.
[32:57.890 --> 32:58.950]  Stop him.
[32:59.250 --> 32:59.870]  Stop him.
[33:00.010 --> 33:01.770]  The Alliance of Spacemen.
[33:02.190 --> 33:02.750]  You idiots.
[33:04.410 --> 33:05.530]  He's done it.
[33:06.390 --> 33:07.590]  Absolute sausages.
[33:14.530 --> 33:16.230]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[33:18.130 --> 33:19.830]  I love the tattoo.
[33:20.870 --> 33:21.910]  Oh, God.
[33:21.930 --> 33:23.050]  Oh, that's so good.
[33:23.330 --> 33:25.390]  Oh, it looks like Dad has a new favorite son.
[33:25.870 --> 33:26.150]  Wow.
[33:26.670 --> 33:28.490]  An amazing match.
[33:28.690 --> 33:42.550]  What twists and turns we saw from Beaster Bunny winning the inaugural championship to the Alliance of Gerpol and Scott Wolfman from space to secure the championship for Gerpol.
[33:44.210 --> 33:44.610]  Incredible.
[33:45.910 --> 33:47.630]  Hail to your new champion.
[33:48.050 --> 33:50.410]  Guys, how are you feeling about what we saw here today?
[33:50.990 --> 33:51.350]  Loved it.
[33:51.850 --> 33:52.810]  So much fun.
[33:53.150 --> 33:53.910]  I feel like...
[33:53.910 --> 33:54.370]  We need to do this again.
[33:54.510 --> 33:55.830]  We need to put belts back on the line.
[33:56.370 --> 33:57.890]  I feel like we opened the door today.
[33:58.210 --> 34:00.250]  And I can't wait to continue to go through it.
[34:00.610 --> 34:01.850]  I will say, I don't remember...
[34:01.850 --> 34:03.630]  I wish I could remember your name to call you out.
[34:03.810 --> 34:09.910]  But in 2K24, the game last year, there was someone that was making regulation arenas.
[34:10.890 --> 34:12.490]  It was incredible.
[34:12.910 --> 34:16.850]  They were all based on Beanhole and Cosmic Crisp.
[34:17.210 --> 34:22.030]  All based on that stuff so we could play in those arenas the next time we do this.
[34:22.090 --> 34:23.450]  If they get created again.
[34:23.590 --> 34:27.570]  So, if you guys make stuff for this game, let us know because we can get it from Community Creations.
[34:28.090 --> 34:29.350]  Thank you so much for watching.
[34:29.970 --> 34:33.390]  Congratulations to Gerpol becoming the champion.
[34:33.610 --> 34:34.990]  This is really great stuff.
[34:35.090 --> 34:36.090]  He showed a lot of heart here.
[34:36.290 --> 34:36.850]  Yeah, good run.
[34:37.450 --> 34:38.370]  Check out the Patreon.
[34:38.590 --> 34:39.550]  Check out the other gameplay videos.
[34:39.550 --> 34:40.610]  Check out the podcast.
[34:41.030 --> 34:42.450]  We'll see you next time.
[34:42.850 --> 34:43.310]  Bye.
[34:43.590 --> 34:43.810]  Bye.
[34:44.050 --> 34:44.230]  Bye.
