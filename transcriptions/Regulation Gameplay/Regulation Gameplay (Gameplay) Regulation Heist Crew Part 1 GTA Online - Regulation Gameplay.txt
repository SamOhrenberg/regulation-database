[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  What are we doing? This is the- are we playing GTA online?
[00:03.200 --> 00:05.720]  We're trying to get you- we're playing GTA online, Eric.
[00:05.860 --> 00:07.200]  And we're trying to get you into my apartment.
[00:07.380 --> 00:07.520]  Okay.
[00:07.580 --> 00:08.380]  All three of you.
[00:08.420 --> 00:10.680]  Can I- can I- can I tell you something, Andrew?
[00:10.860 --> 00:12.620]  Can I- can I confess something to you right now?
[00:12.940 --> 00:18.080]  Uh, I- I thought that you were gonna blindside us and I was- I was gonna be like really upset.
[00:18.660 --> 00:19.300]  Oh, shit.
[00:20.040 --> 00:21.820]  Oh, no! I just left my apartment!
[00:22.080 --> 00:23.020]  Oh, my God.
[00:23.020 --> 00:24.180]  I just blindsided me!
[00:24.360 --> 00:25.320]  So, we're heisting!
[00:25.580 --> 00:29.080]  I've never- I don't think I've ever done a heist. I've never done a heist in this game.
[00:29.660 --> 00:29.980]  Really?
[00:30.280 --> 00:30.800]  I've-
[00:30.800 --> 00:30.820]  No.
[00:31.040 --> 00:32.920]  I don't play- I don't play online games.
[00:33.220 --> 00:35.060]  Here, check out my back. Can you see my back tattoo?
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.180]  Where- uh, let's take a look.
[00:37.560 --> 00:38.900]  We got it. Turn around. Turn around.
[00:38.940 --> 00:39.160]  Oh, there we go.
[00:39.160 --> 00:40.220]  Let me turn around for you. There you go.
[00:40.840 --> 00:41.160]  Oh!
[00:41.960 --> 00:42.840]  How's that- is that cool?
[00:43.820 --> 00:44.840]  Well, he's killing on over there.
[00:45.140 --> 00:46.960]  We're hanging out! Me and Nick are hanging out!
[00:47.140 --> 00:49.180]  Couple of just guys being dudes, you know what I mean?
[00:49.900 --> 00:50.480]  What's-
[00:51.220 --> 00:52.240]  Oh, we're doing this.
[00:52.720 --> 00:53.360]  Oh, what's up? Hey.
[00:53.560 --> 00:54.340]  We're going out.
[00:54.540 --> 00:55.620]  Hey, we're grouping up.
[00:55.900 --> 00:57.580]  I've never seen you without the rat mask. Put it back on.
[00:57.580 --> 00:58.100]  Yeah, me neither.
[00:58.100 --> 00:59.420]  I've never seen you without the rat mask.
[00:59.560 --> 01:02.100]  Oh, this is definitely not-
[01:03.160 --> 01:04.200]  Hey, is this the-
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.440]  This is definitely the wrong thing.
[01:05.460 --> 01:06.900]  You picked the wrong heist. Oh, is that right?
[01:07.020 --> 01:08.380]  I didn't pick the wrong heist!
[01:09.240 --> 01:10.380]  I mean, you kind of did.
[01:10.740 --> 01:14.480]  So when- so, Gavin, when Andrew says he didn't pick the wrong heist, did he pick the right heist?
[01:15.760 --> 01:16.160]  No.
[01:16.380 --> 01:16.440]  Oh, okay.
[01:16.440 --> 01:19.880]  And I think this is halfway through this heist? There's already three things done.
[01:20.300 --> 01:20.520]  Yeah.
[01:21.140 --> 01:21.720]  Oh, no.
[01:21.820 --> 01:24.160]  Yeah, so let's- we're gonna back out of this.
[01:24.160 --> 01:24.740]  Oh, are we?
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.360]  Okay, now it's right.
[01:30.640 --> 01:31.740]  Now we did it.
[01:32.160 --> 01:32.520]  Easy.
[01:32.780 --> 01:33.700]  Gavin, is this the right one?
[01:34.740 --> 01:36.120]  Yeah! Alright!
[01:37.140 --> 01:40.500]  So we are- we're doing a heist. I've never done a heist in this game.
[01:40.600 --> 01:42.260]  It's been out for 11 years or whatever.
[01:42.580 --> 01:43.260]  Never done it.
[01:45.160 --> 01:46.060]  Uh, what-
[01:46.060 --> 01:47.740]  I thought you were saying that to be funny, but you're right.
[01:48.260 --> 01:51.280]  No, yeah, no, I think it's just been out for like 11 years and I've never done this.
[01:51.380 --> 01:52.880]  So, what is a heist?
[01:52.880 --> 01:54.620]  Is it- it's just like a series of jobs?
[01:56.120 --> 01:56.940]  Yeah, like a high-
[01:56.940 --> 01:57.880]  high stakes mission.
[01:58.820 --> 01:59.660]  You can fail it.
[02:00.160 --> 02:02.000]  Uh, it gets pretty difficult.
[02:03.660 --> 02:04.340]  But it's fun?
[02:05.040 --> 02:05.800]  Oh, it's fun.
[02:08.260 --> 02:09.200]  Also, it took like
[02:09.200 --> 02:10.560]  over a year, I think,
[02:10.600 --> 02:11.540]  for them to put the heist out.
[02:12.600 --> 02:13.460]  At least, right?
[02:14.020 --> 02:14.560]  Maybe two.
[02:18.780 --> 02:19.720]  Who's this Tom Cruise-
[02:19.720 --> 02:22.540]  Tom Cruise.
[02:24.640 --> 02:25.240]  Shocking.
[02:25.500 --> 02:28.540]  Yeah, this is a Scientology funded heist.
[02:29.160 --> 02:29.520]  Oh, cool.
[02:42.740 --> 02:43.340]  I...
[02:43.340 --> 02:46.460]  don't know if I'm built to have the patience
[02:46.460 --> 02:46.980]  for this.
[02:50.240 --> 02:52.240]  What do you have patience for?
[02:52.240 --> 02:54.160]  I don't know, but this-
[02:54.160 --> 02:56.120]  but I have a feeling this might not be it.
[02:57.860 --> 02:59.060]  Is this like a board game?
[03:00.200 --> 03:02.340]  It's just- it's a man talking to
[03:02.340 --> 03:04.180]  me that I've never
[03:04.180 --> 03:06.340]  seen, showing me another
[03:06.340 --> 03:08.300]  man I've never seen, and it's
[03:08.300 --> 03:10.360]  just like, let me just get out- can I just get out there?
[03:10.900 --> 03:11.260]  I don't know.
[03:11.780 --> 03:14.200]  This to me is like- yeah, it's like the
[03:14.200 --> 03:16.480]  spiel before laser tag or an escape room.
[03:16.540 --> 03:16.720]  Right.
[03:18.500 --> 03:20.200]  Where in my head, I'm just doing
[03:20.200 --> 03:22.280]  the hand circular forward gesture
[03:22.280 --> 03:23.840]  to hurry up. Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[03:24.060 --> 03:24.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.280]  Oh my god!
[03:30.580 --> 03:32.060]  Oh! That's cool.
[03:32.420 --> 03:34.300]  Oh, fuck. Okay, so now we can-
[03:34.300 --> 03:34.840]  You could've skipped it the whole time?
[03:35.600 --> 03:38.080]  Yep. Steal an aircraft from the Vagos
[03:38.080 --> 03:39.840]  contraband smugglers. So wait, Gavin-
[03:39.840 --> 03:41.880]  Gavin, do you think he could've skipped the other one?
[03:42.440 --> 03:44.360]  No, I hit every button on the other one.
[03:44.460 --> 03:46.160]  No, I was mashing everything
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.340]  I could. Ah, bollocks.
[03:47.340 --> 03:48.800]  Alright, plane?
[03:49.500 --> 03:50.760]  Let's steal a plane, fellas.
[03:50.920 --> 03:52.100]  Let's steal a plane, boys!
[03:53.080 --> 03:54.340]  Let's do this.
[03:54.400 --> 03:56.920]  Okay, so Andrew's the pilot.
[03:58.220 --> 03:58.680]  Oh boy.
[03:58.760 --> 03:59.600]  Oh, god help us.
[04:00.880 --> 04:01.880]  Oh, I'm a good pilot.
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.300]  Is this the Batmobile?
[04:05.040 --> 04:06.500]  Yeah, son, let's go!
[04:07.720 --> 04:07.920]  Ah!
[04:08.780 --> 04:09.140]  Ah!
[04:11.080 --> 04:13.280]  Good god! My new car!
[04:13.980 --> 04:15.180]  Hey, Robin, you got in?
[04:15.180 --> 04:15.720]  Let's go.
[04:16.920 --> 04:18.840]  How do I put on my mask?
[04:20.340 --> 04:20.660]  Ah!
[04:21.620 --> 04:23.420]  What the fuck?!
[04:23.420 --> 04:24.400]  That car's-
[04:24.400 --> 04:25.320]  I'm on my way!
[04:27.580 --> 04:29.300]  Listen, I had to put a lot of money
[04:29.300 --> 04:31.080]  down into this heist
[04:31.080 --> 04:33.100]  to make it happen. We don't all have the funds
[04:33.100 --> 04:34.120]  to have fancy vehicles.
[04:34.660 --> 04:35.860]  How much did you put down for this?
[04:37.460 --> 04:37.860]  Uh...
[04:38.400 --> 04:40.760]  50,000, I guess, including the one I did
[04:40.760 --> 04:41.440]  that was incorrect.
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.580]  Oh, okay.
[04:43.320 --> 04:45.220]  Oh my god!
[04:46.120 --> 04:47.380]  Let's take a little shortcut here.
[04:47.540 --> 04:48.220]  That's good.
[04:48.920 --> 04:50.920]  That looks good.
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.340]  Ah! Oh my god!
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.360]  If you, uh, look to your left
[04:55.360 --> 04:56.920]  for me, you'll see, uh,
[04:57.820 --> 04:58.860]  spin toasters.
[04:59.120 --> 04:59.800]  Oh my god.
[05:01.860 --> 05:02.380]  Gavin!
[05:03.200 --> 05:04.640]  We don't have any lives!
[05:05.820 --> 05:06.120]  Alright.
[05:07.320 --> 05:08.540]  Oh, we don't have-
[05:08.540 --> 05:11.060]  Wait, we only get one life?
[05:11.260 --> 05:13.060]  Yeah, normal is one, and, uh,
[05:13.160 --> 05:13.800]  hard is zero.
[05:14.300 --> 05:16.880]  I feel like describing having zero lives
[05:16.880 --> 05:18.720]  is you get one less than normal.
[05:18.960 --> 05:20.960]  I mean, it's accurate, though.
[05:21.380 --> 05:22.760]  Gavin is going
[05:23.780 --> 05:24.340]  crazy.
[05:24.820 --> 05:27.120]  We're just flying in this car.
[05:27.340 --> 05:28.920]  Oh, so am I. I'm going-
[05:28.920 --> 05:30.340]  Oh, speed demon over here.
[05:30.520 --> 05:31.120]  Speed demon!
[05:31.400 --> 05:33.240]  Oh my god!
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.500]  It's getting low.
[05:36.720 --> 05:37.780]  Capybara semen?
[05:38.140 --> 05:39.420]  I've never done anything like this in
[05:39.420 --> 05:41.760]  Grand Theft Auto Online. This is fucking crazy.
[05:44.080 --> 05:45.720]  I think we're making good ground.
[05:46.460 --> 05:47.460]  We're doing something.
[05:47.820 --> 05:49.100]  Oh, I feel good about it.
[05:49.980 --> 05:50.160]  Yeah.
[05:51.320 --> 05:52.980]  What the fuck?
[05:55.940 --> 05:57.220]  Oh my god!
[05:57.860 --> 05:58.580]  I'm kidding!
[05:59.380 --> 05:59.720]  Uh, yeah.
[06:01.400 --> 06:03.080]  Why'd that dune buggy come for us?
[06:03.920 --> 06:05.120]  Oh, you're
[06:05.120 --> 06:07.200]  getting into this dangerous territory, man.
[06:07.480 --> 06:08.280]  Over here?
[06:09.020 --> 06:11.060]  Yeah, this does not look like you're going to
[06:11.060 --> 06:13.100]  make this through clean.
[06:13.400 --> 06:14.660]  Wait, does it want me to get up?
[06:15.720 --> 06:16.480]  You're stuck.
[06:17.640 --> 06:18.500]  Oh my god!
[06:19.020 --> 06:19.900]  Oh no!
[06:20.540 --> 06:22.000]  Oh no!
[06:23.500 --> 06:24.560]  Didn't make it.
[06:25.760 --> 06:26.620]  Flip the car.
[06:27.440 --> 06:28.540]  Didn't make it there.
[06:29.160 --> 06:29.820]  It was close, though.
[06:29.820 --> 06:31.460]  Oh, oh, oh!
[06:31.560 --> 06:31.800]  Okay.
[06:33.420 --> 06:36.080]  Hey, there's the prison. I could just pull up right now.
[06:36.680 --> 06:37.800]  Are you guys almost at the airfield?
[06:38.160 --> 06:39.520]  Yeah. I'm working on it.
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.060]  I'm getting there. I think so.
[06:41.600 --> 06:43.180]  How about you guys?
[06:43.620 --> 06:44.260]  Oh my god!
[06:46.080 --> 06:47.600]  I don't understand how you two
[06:47.600 --> 06:49.340]  aren't there yet. We're flying there.
[06:49.900 --> 06:51.540]  We had to take a couple of detours.
[06:51.720 --> 06:53.500]  Gavin took a
[06:53.500 --> 06:55.400]  circuitous route to get to where we're going.
[06:56.620 --> 06:57.900]  How do you think Batman's
[06:57.900 --> 06:59.360]  always there when they need him?
[06:59.900 --> 07:01.920]  Using a car like this, apparently?
[07:02.400 --> 07:04.180]  Oh no! Oh my god!
[07:04.440 --> 07:04.840]  Cactus.
[07:06.480 --> 07:06.880]  Backseat.
[07:07.480 --> 07:09.260]  Oh my god, we're doing a McTwist.
[07:10.120 --> 07:11.280]  Oh, what a landing!
[07:11.860 --> 07:12.720]  That was nice, wasn't it?
[07:12.860 --> 07:13.780]  That was phenomenal.
[07:15.020 --> 07:17.520]  And then just driving straight, you bunged it.
[07:19.500 --> 07:21.060]  That was a little bit of a bungle.
[07:21.820 --> 07:23.780]  Oh, I see somebody. Oh, I see you both
[07:23.780 --> 07:24.420]  on my mini-map.
[07:24.420 --> 07:26.340]  Yeah, this is really something.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.460]  I don't think I can jump the lake, so
[07:28.460 --> 07:29.380]  we're gonna have to take the road.
[07:31.940 --> 07:32.920]  We'll take it fast.
[07:33.540 --> 07:34.280]  I get it.
[07:35.620 --> 07:36.480]  Is this a ramp?
[07:36.620 --> 07:37.420]  I can't believe y'all aren't there yet.
[07:37.420 --> 07:38.380]  Oh my god!
[07:40.440 --> 07:41.240]  Oh, shit!
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.320]  We're about to get to me.
[07:43.560 --> 07:45.240]  We might be swimming here, boys.
[07:45.400 --> 07:46.680]  Hey guys, we're gonna need a ride.
[07:47.900 --> 07:48.620]  I'm drowning!
[07:49.860 --> 07:50.920]  Swim, fool, swim!
[07:50.920 --> 07:52.560]  I'm under the car!
[07:53.000 --> 07:54.140]  Oh my god.
[07:54.460 --> 07:55.300]  It shot me
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.200]  into the sky.
[07:58.460 --> 07:59.120]  It's armored.
[08:01.020 --> 08:02.080]  Eric, stop dicking around.
[08:02.080 --> 08:04.640]  Why would you even just don't even drive the car?
[08:04.760 --> 08:05.600]  Let me just get in.
[08:07.920 --> 08:08.940]  Oh my god.
[08:09.260 --> 08:10.640]  Okay, so now, Nick,
[08:10.720 --> 08:12.900]  when you drive, when you see something that kind of
[08:12.900 --> 08:14.940]  looks like a ramp, do you have an afterburner
[08:14.940 --> 08:16.740]  that shoots you 100 feet in the air, or no?
[08:16.740 --> 08:18.220]  No, but I'm gonna hit it regardless.
[08:18.220 --> 08:18.480]  Run!
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.420]  Wow, that was great, Nick.
[08:22.940 --> 08:24.160]  Alright, if I had
[08:24.160 --> 08:25.340]  afterburners, we'd be in the air.
[08:26.860 --> 08:27.400]  That's a wall.
[08:29.720 --> 08:30.300]  Okay, guys,
[08:30.340 --> 08:31.000]  we'll just go around the wall.
[08:31.880 --> 08:34.180]  Andrew, where are you at? I'm on my way there.
[08:34.220 --> 08:35.840]  I'm about 2.28 miles away.
[08:36.320 --> 08:38.440]  Why were you bitching at us for not being there yet?
[08:39.280 --> 08:40.060]  I wasn't bitching,
[08:40.140 --> 08:41.700]  I was just saying I'm surprised that you weren't there yet.
[08:42.680 --> 08:43.560]  That's quite a long way.
[08:43.940 --> 08:45.440]  It is. It's a distance.
[08:45.440 --> 08:46.840]  I feel like I'm kind of close.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.460]  So we should be safe in this, because it's armored, allegedly?
[08:50.380 --> 08:50.780]  Allegedly.
[08:52.520 --> 08:53.240]  Oh, equipment!
[08:53.240 --> 08:54.760]  Wait, how do you...
[08:54.760 --> 08:55.280]  Wait.
[08:56.340 --> 08:59.440]  Wait, how do I get there?
[08:59.760 --> 09:00.880]  It took away my marker.
[09:01.220 --> 09:02.320]  What do you mean it took away the marker?
[09:03.040 --> 09:05.460]  I'm two miles away, and I don't have a marker.
[09:06.260 --> 09:08.640]  Oh, fuck.
[09:08.980 --> 09:10.240]  What happened?
[09:10.700 --> 09:11.680]  Gavin, how did you die?
[09:11.680 --> 09:11.880]  Gavin!
[09:13.580 --> 09:15.420]  Did you get teleported?
[09:15.600 --> 09:16.960]  I would cut my ass, Nick.
[09:17.300 --> 09:18.180]  I made $1,400.
[09:19.900 --> 09:20.340]  Nice!
[09:20.740 --> 09:21.560]  Maybe it's not armored.
[09:22.060 --> 09:22.980]  Restart at checkpoint.
[09:23.440 --> 09:24.860]  The windows aren't armored.
[09:27.600 --> 09:28.500]  Restart at checkpoint.
[09:28.780 --> 09:31.800]  Yeah, the windows could use some armoring, I think.
[09:32.080 --> 09:33.720]  Yeah, maybe we get out and just use cover.
[09:34.320 --> 09:34.600]  Yeah.
[09:35.120 --> 09:36.020]  Oh, yeah?
[09:36.980 --> 09:38.180]  Man, I wish I had my Batmobile.
[09:38.180 --> 09:39.600]  I could have just rocked it through.
[09:40.000 --> 09:40.900]  Maybe you get it back.
[09:42.200 --> 09:44.360]  Oh, wow. Oh, God. Oh, we don't start too far.
[09:44.680 --> 09:46.120]  Oh, thank God we don't start too far.
[09:46.700 --> 09:47.320]  We are right here.
[09:47.900 --> 09:49.400]  That was for the best.
[09:49.920 --> 09:52.560]  By the way, we just lost criminal masterminds challenge.
[09:53.100 --> 09:53.520]  What is that?
[09:54.740 --> 09:55.760]  Do all the heists without dying.
[09:56.240 --> 09:56.360]  Oh.
[09:57.900 --> 09:58.320]  Okay.
[09:58.780 --> 10:00.200]  Are these our vehicles?
[10:01.480 --> 10:03.760]  The red car is mine if anyone wants a ride.
[10:05.520 --> 10:05.780]  Oh.
[10:05.780 --> 10:06.740]  I'll go back to the airfield.
[10:08.220 --> 10:09.720]  Andrew does not want a ride. He has a bike.
[10:10.680 --> 10:11.560]  Yeah, I got my vehicle.
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.060]  Listen, times are tough. I have to pay for the heists.
[10:14.260 --> 10:15.120]  Oh, Nick, you know what to do.
[10:16.180 --> 10:16.780]  Don't ram me.
[10:16.780 --> 10:18.580]  Don't ram me.
[10:20.560 --> 10:21.680]  Oh, my God.
[10:21.820 --> 10:23.840]  I am so far off if you hit me.
[10:23.900 --> 10:24.740]  I swear to God.
[10:27.120 --> 10:28.260]  I'm in the fucking woods
[10:28.260 --> 10:29.020]  if you hit me.
[10:29.980 --> 10:31.400]  No, you piece of shit!
[10:31.840 --> 10:32.160]  Yes!
[10:36.080 --> 10:38.880]  Sorry, I saw a bicyclist.
[10:39.040 --> 10:40.000]  I had to do something about it.
[10:40.220 --> 10:40.980]  Yeah, it has to be done.
[10:42.900 --> 10:44.360]  Were you on that the whole way?
[10:45.380 --> 10:45.700]  Yes.
[10:46.980 --> 10:47.680]  That's why I was like,
[10:47.700 --> 10:49.800]  I'm surprised you guys aren't there yet because I'm kind of close.
[10:50.200 --> 10:51.560]  My hand is sore from pumping.
[10:51.860 --> 10:54.660]  I had no idea you were on a freaking bicycle the whole time.
[10:54.660 --> 10:55.040]  Let's do this.
[10:56.820 --> 10:57.900]  All right, let's do it.
[10:58.480 --> 10:59.040]  Come on, boy.
[10:59.040 --> 10:59.100]  All right.
[11:01.260 --> 11:02.560]  Two down, cleaning it up.
[11:02.780 --> 11:03.080]  Move up!
[11:04.220 --> 11:06.300]  How do you get to cover? Is it right bumper?
[11:07.900 --> 11:08.680]  Yes, right bumper.
[11:10.200 --> 11:10.980]  Oh, there's a man there.
[11:13.480 --> 11:13.780]  Oh!
[11:14.080 --> 11:15.880]  I'm dying real bad.
[11:16.800 --> 11:17.900]  No, stay alive.
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.180]  Get behind something.
[11:21.540 --> 11:23.060]  I am full of holes.
[11:23.340 --> 11:24.000]  Slow and steady.
[11:28.590 --> 11:29.550]  Slow and steady.
[11:29.550 --> 11:29.810]  Slow and steady.
[11:29.830 --> 11:29.990]  Hey, prick.
[11:32.190 --> 11:32.950]  Dick's favorite.
[11:34.990 --> 11:35.390]  What?
[11:37.090 --> 11:38.130]  Andrew's on a bike.
[11:39.190 --> 11:40.190]  I've just got here.
[11:41.810 --> 11:42.630]  Don't get killed.
[11:44.090 --> 11:44.690]  Oh, shit.
[11:44.710 --> 11:45.430]  There's more people coming.
[11:45.710 --> 11:46.310]  Oh, shit.
[11:47.130 --> 11:49.290]  What are we supposed to do? Do we just kill these guys?
[11:49.750 --> 11:50.430]  Yeah, let's kill them.
[11:51.770 --> 11:52.570]  Uh-oh.
[11:52.570 --> 11:53.390]  Gavin?
[11:53.890 --> 11:54.790]  I'm getting some distance.
[11:55.210 --> 11:55.710]  Oh, God.
[11:59.110 --> 11:59.670]  Andrew!
[12:00.550 --> 12:01.550]  Fuck you, Nick.
[12:01.710 --> 12:03.050]  That was from before.
[12:04.770 --> 12:05.910]  Goddamn, they're everywhere.
[12:06.310 --> 12:06.590]  Incoming.
[12:07.290 --> 12:07.850]  Behind us.
[12:08.330 --> 12:10.610]  In a car.
[12:12.910 --> 12:14.290]  Damn, it's getting crazy.
[12:14.630 --> 12:15.190]  Oh, I'm going to die.
[12:15.370 --> 12:17.890]  Oh, this is bad.
[12:18.190 --> 12:18.950]  I'm alive.
[12:22.650 --> 12:23.370]  Oh, shit.
[12:23.750 --> 12:24.270]  Nick!
[12:26.490 --> 12:27.010]  Nick!
[12:28.810 --> 12:30.350]  Yep, yep, yep.
[12:30.350 --> 12:30.970]  Yep, yep, yep.
[12:32.390 --> 12:34.890]  No dollars. Why'd I get no dollars for that?
[12:36.690 --> 12:38.990]  Does anyone have the Amid Karuma?
[12:40.830 --> 12:41.030]  No.
[12:41.490 --> 12:43.770]  I own it, but it's not letting me select it for some reason.
[12:43.950 --> 12:44.330]  Oh.
[12:45.330 --> 12:47.170]  And we skipped buying the armor?
[12:48.310 --> 12:49.430]  Why didn't you buy the armor?
[12:49.430 --> 12:49.830]  I hit it.
[12:50.310 --> 12:51.010]  It didn't let me.
[12:51.990 --> 12:53.250]  Load it in, load it out.
[12:54.970 --> 12:55.650]  That's on you.
[12:55.890 --> 12:56.110]  Nope.
[12:56.930 --> 12:58.710]  Sounds like a you problem, because I was able to buy the armor.
[12:58.910 --> 13:01.170]  I don't know who else that would be on.
[13:03.150 --> 13:03.790]  The game?
[13:07.170 --> 13:08.690]  Was it on the game that you died?
[13:09.050 --> 13:09.710]  Or was that on you?
[13:09.750 --> 13:10.410]  No, that's me.
[13:10.790 --> 13:11.170]  Oh, okay.
[13:12.030 --> 13:14.810]  If you wouldn't have died, then you wouldn't have missed out on the armor.
[13:14.810 --> 13:16.290]  So it is all, it goes back.
[13:16.670 --> 13:16.850]  Alright.
[13:17.970 --> 13:18.870]  Chain of events.
[13:24.530 --> 13:25.670]  Andrew's taking his bike again.
[13:25.910 --> 13:26.630]  Yeah, I saw.
[13:26.990 --> 13:28.250]  It's my vehicle of choice.
[13:29.590 --> 13:30.470]  You've made your choice.
[13:31.590 --> 13:32.830]  Watch out for that building, Nick.
[13:36.670 --> 13:37.450]  Andrew, look out.
[13:37.630 --> 13:38.950]  I'm gonna get there faster than y'all.
[13:39.110 --> 13:39.310]  Okay.
[13:41.470 --> 13:42.190]  Oh!
[13:43.190 --> 13:43.910]  Oh!
[13:45.030 --> 13:45.750]  Oh!
[13:46.270 --> 13:49.010]  There goes all the armor I paid for.
[13:49.410 --> 13:49.590]  Ah!
[13:51.650 --> 13:53.690]  He ran into the sign!
[13:53.910 --> 13:55.670]  He ran into the sign.
[13:56.250 --> 13:57.570]  He dunced.
[13:57.910 --> 13:59.790]  Some people might say I had that coming.
[14:00.270 --> 14:01.250]  Oh, shit.
[14:01.690 --> 14:02.810]  That's so funny.
[14:05.670 --> 14:06.810]  Right behind you.
[14:07.510 --> 14:07.910]  Okay.
[14:09.130 --> 14:10.390]  Third time's a charm.
[14:11.030 --> 14:11.870]  Gavin, how far did you go?
[14:12.730 --> 14:13.650]  Not very far.
[14:13.910 --> 14:14.090]  Okay.
[14:16.530 --> 14:18.350]  I didn't know you were gonna stop.
[14:22.990 --> 14:24.170]  When's a good place for cover?
[14:24.730 --> 14:26.310]  I think where we started was good.
[14:26.390 --> 14:28.050]  I think we just have to move in from there.
[14:29.370 --> 14:30.730]  Yeah, and just watch out for when
[14:31.770 --> 14:32.430]  reinforcements show up.
[14:32.470 --> 14:34.010]  Yeah, when the other guys start coming in.
[14:34.850 --> 14:36.810]  Because this seems like a nice little funnel
[14:36.810 --> 14:38.410]  where they all feed in.
[14:39.130 --> 14:40.190]  Like where I am here.
[14:41.070 --> 14:47.240]  Yeah, like this.
[14:48.320 --> 14:49.360]  Nice, good work.
[14:55.840 --> 14:56.880]  I got ranked up!
[14:56.940 --> 14:57.620]  I got ranked up!
[14:59.120 --> 15:00.500]  Let's maybe move up a little.
[15:01.100 --> 15:01.800]  Get cover!
[15:04.980 --> 15:05.840]  Oh, bad.
[15:06.540 --> 15:08.840]  Oh, that's the worst cover I've ever had.
[15:10.300 --> 15:11.220]  Hello, lads!
[15:13.820 --> 15:14.360]  What?
[15:15.760 --> 15:16.260]  What?
[15:16.320 --> 15:16.740]  What did he do?
[15:18.400 --> 15:18.980]  Got him.
[15:19.080 --> 15:20.080]  There we go.
[15:21.340 --> 15:23.160]  Oh, shit! Hell yeah!
[15:23.920 --> 15:24.620]  What's up, dudes?
[15:25.940 --> 15:26.880]  Where are you?
[15:26.920 --> 15:27.640]  Watch your side!
[15:28.880 --> 15:30.700]  Oh, they're coming from behind you!
[15:31.780 --> 15:32.320]  Nick!
[15:32.640 --> 15:35.400]  Archie just walked in here and was like,
[15:35.440 --> 15:36.840]  what's happening to those guys?
[15:37.980 --> 15:39.220]  They're having fun.
[15:39.220 --> 15:40.660]  They're having fun together.
[15:40.980 --> 15:42.680]  They're getting riddled with good times.
[15:42.920 --> 15:43.300]  Yeah.
[15:44.500 --> 15:45.440]  Nice shooting.
[15:46.460 --> 15:47.640]  Another car coming up.
[15:49.040 --> 15:50.760]  Oh, dead as dicks.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.560]  Ow, I just got plugged by someone.
[15:54.860 --> 15:56.800]  Don't forget to eat some stuff if you can.
[15:57.280 --> 15:58.740]  Oh yeah, eat a piece of Q's.
[16:00.020 --> 16:00.580]  Where's that again?
[16:01.600 --> 16:03.660]  Hold select health and armor.
[16:04.360 --> 16:04.880]  Got it.
[16:05.380 --> 16:05.900]  Thanks.
[16:09.500 --> 16:10.300]  Oh, shit!
[16:11.360 --> 16:12.740]  I'm getting fu- I died.
[16:12.840 --> 16:15.060]  I got fucking blasted. There were guys behind us.
[16:15.160 --> 16:15.820]  Oh, you know what?
[16:16.080 --> 16:18.460]  Cool, thanks, man.
[16:20.480 --> 16:21.240]  It's carb loading.
[16:25.640 --> 16:26.980]  Maybe after the first wave,
[16:27.060 --> 16:28.360]  Eric, come into the hangar with us.
[16:28.480 --> 16:30.860]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[16:32.260 --> 16:33.800]  Felt good the way we moved in there.
[16:34.060 --> 16:35.580]  The way we moved in there
[16:35.580 --> 16:37.520]  and pressured everyone, I felt good about that.
[16:38.340 --> 16:39.740]  I spent $4000
[16:39.740 --> 16:41.500]  worth of minigun ammo in that round.
[16:42.240 --> 16:44.040]  What? Why are you using a minigun?
[16:44.660 --> 16:45.840]  Why wouldn't I use a minigun?
[16:45.960 --> 16:46.780]  Yeah, he sent us a message.
[16:47.240 --> 16:48.580]  Just use a carbine.
[16:49.740 --> 16:51.120]  Says the guy who died.
[16:51.340 --> 16:53.680]  These guys are so weak.
[16:54.360 --> 16:55.880]  Yeah, keep eating your fucking snacks,
[16:56.040 --> 16:56.200]  Andrew.
[16:57.200 --> 16:59.880]  I think if you just have the
[16:59.880 --> 17:01.260]  carbine, it feels like you can probably
[17:01.260 --> 17:02.320]  eat through them pretty quick.
[17:03.680 --> 17:04.900]  Oh, I'll eat through them pretty quick.
[17:07.580 --> 17:08.920]  You know what? This is a good idea.
[17:09.440 --> 17:11.800]  Should we just roll straight up into the thing?
[17:11.960 --> 17:12.980]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[17:13.400 --> 17:15.580]  I think if we all...
[17:15.920 --> 17:17.220]  Whoa, Gavin is ready.
[17:17.680 --> 17:19.100]  Gavin, I thought you were going to get in the car with us.
[17:21.100 --> 17:21.820]  I'm already gone.
[17:21.900 --> 17:22.820]  You guys haven't even left yet.
[17:22.840 --> 17:24.060]  I want your car to be a part of this.
[17:25.900 --> 17:27.060]  You lead the charge.
[17:28.240 --> 17:29.360]  Andrew, you lead the charge.
[17:29.760 --> 17:30.400]  At a safe distance.
[17:30.400 --> 17:31.160]  Yep, I am.
[17:34.700 --> 17:35.660]  You fucked.
[17:37.800 --> 17:38.280]  No!
[17:38.500 --> 17:39.740]  No! No! No!
[17:44.360 --> 17:47.200]  I hit my face on a piece of wood.
[17:48.240 --> 17:50.960]  You think I won't come down?
[17:52.200 --> 17:53.780]  Your boys are out of the game.
[17:53.980 --> 17:56.100]  Oh, fuck, dude. It's funny every time.
[17:56.480 --> 17:57.180]  Holy shit.
[17:59.360 --> 18:01.700]  So do we want to push right in and just hold that hanger?
[18:01.820 --> 18:02.220]  Is that the idea?
[18:02.400 --> 18:02.460]  Yeah.
[18:02.480 --> 18:04.580]  Yeah, right there.
[18:06.240 --> 18:07.700]  What? Oh my god, Nick.
[18:08.580 --> 18:09.380]  Holy shit.
[18:09.740 --> 18:10.300]  There we go.
[18:10.620 --> 18:12.420]  I don't know about this.
[18:12.540 --> 18:13.380]  No, not there, Eric.
[18:14.100 --> 18:16.840]  I didn't know that you were going all the way.
[18:17.720 --> 18:18.740]  Oh, baby, that's what I do.
[18:19.780 --> 18:21.880]  Oh, shit, I got freaking RPG equipped.
[18:22.800 --> 18:24.120]  Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.100]  Chain RPG.
[18:26.520 --> 18:26.920]  Shooting
[18:26.920 --> 18:28.160]  50 rockets a second.
[18:29.020 --> 18:31.060]  Dude, I don't know how I died.
[18:31.820 --> 18:33.080]  I'm almost there, guys.
[18:33.220 --> 18:33.640]  Yeah, sorry.
[18:34.180 --> 18:34.560]  No!
[18:36.620 --> 18:38.280]  Andrew, get in the car!
[18:39.500 --> 18:41.060]  Stop hitting me with yours
[18:41.060 --> 18:42.680]  and I'll get there at the same time!
[18:43.160 --> 18:44.800]  Andrew, it has to be done.
[18:44.880 --> 18:45.920]  It's the rule of the road.
[18:48.100 --> 18:49.080]  Well, you don't know the rules.
[18:51.120 --> 18:52.900]  You ain't getting me this time. I'll tell you that much.
[18:52.900 --> 18:53.600]  Oh, okay.
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.840]  Nick, I'll ride with you. I'll stay in the car all the way.
[18:57.080 --> 18:57.300]  Alright.
[18:58.160 --> 19:00.420]  I thought we were pulling up alongside bailing out.
[19:00.960 --> 19:02.560]  Oh, yeah, we'll use the car for cover.
[19:03.240 --> 19:05.420]  I don't know why I thought that was the way we were gonna go.
[19:05.420 --> 19:06.680]  I thought you said we're going straight in the hangar.
[19:06.840 --> 19:07.420]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[19:08.380 --> 19:10.460]  I started putting together a fantasy
[19:10.460 --> 19:11.900]  of hiding behind the car.
[19:15.820 --> 19:17.080]  I like that movie, too,
[19:17.140 --> 19:17.540]  but, you know.
[19:24.090 --> 19:25.230]  What's happening over there?
[19:25.870 --> 19:26.590]  Break it out!
[19:27.670 --> 19:28.030]  You want in?
[19:28.230 --> 19:29.130]  Are you going to Eric's?
[19:29.350 --> 19:29.950]  I'm going to this one.
[19:31.310 --> 19:32.670]  I don't know why I asked the question, Eric.
[19:32.830 --> 19:34.650]  I mean, I'm with you. I don't know.
[19:36.050 --> 19:37.050]  Oh, that's a guy on foot.
[19:37.090 --> 19:37.610]  I thought it was Andrew.
[19:41.810 --> 19:43.130]  Why are you making me do this, Andrew?
[19:45.210 --> 19:46.830]  Why are you making me do this?
[19:47.210 --> 19:48.430]  You ain't gonna get me this time.
[19:49.510 --> 19:49.890]  You ain't gonna get me this time.
[19:49.890 --> 19:50.690]  You ain't gonna get me this time.
[19:50.690 --> 19:52.710]  Oh, there's two of us.
[19:53.250 --> 19:54.310]  Bring it on!
[19:54.650 --> 19:55.770]  He split the difference.
[19:56.510 --> 19:56.930]  Oh, well.
[19:58.030 --> 19:59.490]  You ain't gonna get me this time.
[20:01.770 --> 20:02.330]  What?!
[20:06.630 --> 20:08.350]  Oh, my God!
[20:09.270 --> 20:10.470]  You ain't gonna get me this time!
[20:10.810 --> 20:11.110]  Impressive.
[20:12.250 --> 20:17.820]  Oh, God!
[20:17.960 --> 20:19.420]  You already got me once!
[20:20.660 --> 20:21.920]  Alright, you wanna load in?
[20:24.480 --> 20:25.480]  Let's do this.
[20:27.040 --> 20:28.260]  Alright, let's do this!
[20:28.520 --> 20:29.280]  Let's try this.
[20:30.300 --> 20:32.840]  Watch as Andrew makes it 16 feet
[20:32.840 --> 20:34.360]  before falling off.
[20:38.380 --> 20:39.880]  He's going back for the fuck...
[20:39.880 --> 20:42.360]  Okay, that's what it looked like for me, too.
[20:42.580 --> 20:45.320]  Why don't you drive us straight into the hangar?
[20:45.340 --> 20:45.760]  Straight in.
[20:46.160 --> 20:48.880]  And we'll kill a person in there and then just sit tight.
[20:48.880 --> 20:52.500]  You guys know how I just split the difference a minute ago between those trees?
[20:52.800 --> 20:54.200]  I was in backwards camera.
[20:54.340 --> 20:55.020]  That was an accident.
[20:55.200 --> 20:57.600]  I wanted to see where I was going forward. That was incredible.
[20:59.580 --> 21:00.700]  Okay, we're going right in the hangar.
[21:01.060 --> 21:01.120]  Yep.
[21:03.480 --> 21:04.780]  Right in the hangar.
[21:04.960 --> 21:05.960]  Okay, right in the hangar.
[21:06.240 --> 21:07.640]  Right in the hangar.
[21:07.980 --> 21:08.340]  On my bike.
[21:09.380 --> 21:10.800]  We're not worried about the car exploding?
[21:11.820 --> 21:12.260]  Nah, it's alright.
[21:14.080 --> 21:14.720]  That guy dead?
[21:14.880 --> 21:15.480]  No, he's alive.
[21:17.180 --> 21:17.620]  He's dead.
[21:18.120 --> 21:19.320]  Oh, I got hit with a shotgun.
[21:20.060 --> 21:22.340]  Eric, I think you died from the guy in the hangar last time.
[21:22.440 --> 21:23.960]  Yeah, I think so.
[21:24.260 --> 21:25.360]  I didn't know there was a guy in there.
[21:25.780 --> 21:27.880]  Shooting the plane? Not part of the plan.
[21:30.520 --> 21:31.660]  I hope the pilot's good.
[21:31.660 --> 21:33.300]  Andrew, do you want to get behind cover on this desk?
[21:34.840 --> 21:36.420]  It's back two steps to your right.
[21:36.620 --> 21:36.920]  Right there.
[21:36.920 --> 21:37.860]  Thanks.
[21:41.200 --> 21:46.560]  Man, I need to suck down some freaking P's and Q's.
[21:46.680 --> 21:46.940]  Yeah.
[21:49.160 --> 21:53.680]  Wait, what happened?
[21:54.420 --> 21:54.900]  Gavin?
[21:55.160 --> 21:57.760]  I need to suck down some P's and Q's.
[21:58.500 --> 21:58.980]  Maybe.
[21:59.100 --> 22:03.400]  You doing that made me suck down some P's and Q's and I missed the notification because of it.
[22:04.940 --> 22:05.960]  Maybe what, Nick?
[22:05.960 --> 22:06.740]  Buy an armor.
[22:09.360 --> 22:14.180]  Maybe I leave the car in the middle of the hangar.
[22:14.180 --> 22:14.740]  And then we run in?
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.240]  And then we run in.
[22:16.800 --> 22:21.800]  So we'll pull into the hangar, but we'll leave it on the outskirts so we can use it for cover.
[22:22.140 --> 22:22.660]  Love it.
[22:22.780 --> 22:25.000]  Now, here's the thing. I like that movie, too.
[22:25.500 --> 22:26.000]  Yeah, okay.
[22:27.100 --> 22:28.720]  So do we want to roll with that movie?
[22:29.020 --> 22:29.880]  I love it.
[22:30.340 --> 22:32.800]  Let's do it. That was my imagination and now we're doing it.
[22:32.800 --> 22:33.800]  So I get to live my dream.
[22:36.160 --> 22:37.440]  Is this video going to come out?
[22:38.800 --> 22:39.480]  This one?
[22:39.680 --> 22:41.620]  No, this one might be too embarrassing.
[22:43.100 --> 22:43.800]  For who?
[22:45.460 --> 22:46.260]  All of us.
[22:46.400 --> 22:46.560]  Not for me.
[22:48.340 --> 22:50.840]  Wait, Gavin didn't even take my car.
[22:50.920 --> 22:52.000]  He just took a car.
[22:52.960 --> 22:54.140]  I think he's sending a message now.
[22:58.820 --> 23:00.500]  He just ate this post.
[23:02.800 --> 23:03.160]  What?
[23:04.980 --> 23:06.140]  Oh, my bike's still up.
[23:06.380 --> 23:08.320]  Wait a second! Who's this?
[23:08.600 --> 23:10.320]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[23:10.820 --> 23:13.200]  Gavin, the guy that...
[23:13.780 --> 23:15.000]  Gavin, the guy that you
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.720]  fucked with just came back
[23:16.720 --> 23:18.200]  and fucking pulled me out of the car.
[23:18.800 --> 23:20.600]  Well, you know, we're on the same team. We're a partnership.
[23:20.880 --> 23:21.780]  Alright, Andrew, get in.
[23:22.720 --> 23:23.740]  Uh, alright.
[23:25.080 --> 23:25.480]  Wait.
[23:26.220 --> 23:28.820]  Wait, did Nick take the other car? Am I riding with Gavin?
[23:28.920 --> 23:29.920]  I thought I was riding with Nick.
[23:29.920 --> 23:31.880]  You know what a minivan is, dude?
[23:33.940 --> 23:35.460]  Are we all in here?
[23:35.700 --> 23:37.360]  No, I'm back here!
[23:37.460 --> 23:38.960]  Oh, Nick is in his own car.
[23:41.540 --> 23:43.780]  I was thinking, what's a better car to hide behind?
[23:44.140 --> 23:45.400]  Uh, a minivan's pretty good.
[23:45.420 --> 23:47.160]  A tiny red one or a minivan?
[23:47.640 --> 23:49.860]  Right. Well, here comes the armored one.
[23:52.600 --> 23:53.540]  Here I go!
[23:54.960 --> 23:56.380]  Oh, my God.
[23:59.900 --> 24:00.500]  Nick!
[24:03.900 --> 24:05.220]  They're both alive!
[24:05.520 --> 24:07.460]  Oh, we're dead.
[24:08.380 --> 24:09.200]  Get out!
[24:10.440 --> 24:11.340]  There's the cover!
[24:11.920 --> 24:12.320]  Oh, God!
[24:13.480 --> 24:15.380]  I died. I got fucking...
[24:15.380 --> 24:17.340]  We just got fucking wasted.
[24:18.040 --> 24:20.000]  I'm just sitting in the passenger seat
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.360]  and getting blown to shit!
[24:21.760 --> 24:23.420]  It's a van killed man!
[24:23.420 --> 24:24.400]  I had to hop over it!
[24:25.640 --> 24:27.840]  I didn't understand a word of that.
[24:28.340 --> 24:30.020]  The van! I had to hop over it!
[24:30.080 --> 24:30.740]  It killed me!
[24:31.400 --> 24:32.600]  Oh, the van was too high?
[24:33.560 --> 24:35.420]  I got riddled at the top!
[24:37.240 --> 24:38.760]  You just stood on the minivan?
[24:39.240 --> 24:41.540]  Yeah, I stood. Well, I hopped over it to get over it.
[24:41.600 --> 24:42.640]  It was just...
[24:46.780 --> 24:47.620]  We're almost there.
[24:47.720 --> 24:48.940]  I feel good about this one.
[24:49.620 --> 24:50.040]  Yeah, what's up?
[24:50.040 --> 24:50.540]  Don't think about it.
[24:51.020 --> 24:53.940]  Don't get shot. A movie where we don't get shot
[24:53.940 --> 24:54.740]  must kill everyone.
[24:55.620 --> 24:58.180]  I thought we had a plan on the last one
[24:58.180 --> 25:00.260]  and then I was just all of a sudden in a van with Gavin.
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.080]  Well, I think that was only
[25:02.080 --> 25:02.620]  your doing.
[25:03.700 --> 25:05.860]  I got pulled out by some guy!
[25:08.800 --> 25:10.240]  I thought I was riding with Nick
[25:10.240 --> 25:10.940]  in this thing.
[25:11.140 --> 25:13.680]  You were, initially. And then I got pulled out!
[25:16.900 --> 25:17.960]  Oh, my God!
[25:21.080 --> 25:22.180]  Go, go, go!
[25:22.280 --> 25:23.960]  Alright, I have butterfly-ed
[25:23.960 --> 25:25.140]  effected this shit now.
[25:25.300 --> 25:26.360]  Go, go, go!
[25:27.200 --> 25:28.640]  Now to deal with Andrew.
[25:29.940 --> 25:31.600]  Now to deal with him!
[25:33.160 --> 25:34.440]  Let me switch to grenades.
[25:35.340 --> 25:35.760]  Go for it.
[25:36.880 --> 25:37.920]  He's doing tricks!
[25:38.020 --> 25:38.900]  He's taunting you!
[25:40.520 --> 25:41.560]  Oh, my God!
[25:42.660 --> 25:43.020]  I missed.
[25:43.380 --> 25:45.860]  Give me some space.
[25:45.860 --> 25:48.120]  Execute it no matter how good the plan is.
[25:48.440 --> 25:49.960]  I missed. Oh, shit!
[25:52.860 --> 25:54.240]  Oh, shit!
[25:56.440 --> 25:57.440]  I'm gonna pin you.
[25:57.700 --> 25:58.820]  I'm gonna pin you so good.
[26:03.300 --> 26:04.880]  That was awesome!
[26:06.160 --> 26:07.880]  That looks so sick. I got such a good
[26:07.880 --> 26:09.140]  shot of that. That was so cool.
[26:09.300 --> 26:10.020]  Oh, you little bastard!
[26:12.460 --> 26:13.340]  Oh, shit!
[26:13.720 --> 26:15.120]  Alright, we got him. Let's go, boys!
[26:17.120 --> 26:18.100]  Alright, just to make sure.
[26:18.280 --> 26:18.720]  Alright, let's go.
[26:19.560 --> 26:19.920]  Good.
[26:20.320 --> 26:22.200]  Just roll it over the...
[26:24.600 --> 26:25.500]  That's how I'm gonna get
[26:25.500 --> 26:26.020]  home!
[26:27.280 --> 26:27.920]  Here we go.
[26:32.300 --> 26:33.140]  Nice hit, Nick.
[26:33.160 --> 26:33.680]  There you go!
[26:34.700 --> 26:35.300]  That was good.
[26:36.660 --> 26:37.660]  Get him out!
[26:38.720 --> 26:40.380]  Oh, I got melted by the dog!
[26:40.380 --> 26:42.220]  Stop moving! Why didn't you move?
[26:42.400 --> 26:44.140]  The door got knocked!
[26:45.560 --> 26:45.900]  Whoops.
[26:46.680 --> 26:47.920]  Get the guy in the back!
[26:48.060 --> 26:49.780]  I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[26:50.620 --> 26:51.120]  Stop!
[26:52.820 --> 26:55.080]  What is wrong with you?
[26:55.400 --> 26:56.180]  What happened?
[26:56.540 --> 26:57.300]  Let's just approach.
[26:58.840 --> 26:59.340]  What?
[27:00.500 --> 27:01.500]  What happened?
[27:01.860 --> 27:04.340]  I hid behind a desk to get my
[27:04.340 --> 27:05.800]  P's and Q's, and I got shot in the head.
[27:07.280 --> 27:08.660]  Were you behind cover?
[27:09.280 --> 27:09.720]  No.
[27:10.640 --> 27:12.680]  Okay, so you didn't hide behind the desk.
[27:14.120 --> 27:14.740]  Well, I stood behind
[27:14.740 --> 27:15.140]  the desk.
[27:15.980 --> 27:18.240]  I'm behind desks on
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.240]  head height.
[27:21.020 --> 27:22.600]  The lower half of my body
[27:22.600 --> 27:24.620]  was covered, Gavin. What am I supposed to do?
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.540]  When you put it that way,
[27:26.600 --> 27:27.140]  I could see how you were thinking.
[27:27.140 --> 27:29.820]  They didn't shoot me in the legs once, so now what?
[27:30.220 --> 27:32.140]  No, they shot me in the leg lots.
[27:34.160 --> 27:35.000]  I'm showing him
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.320]  to half of these conflicts
[27:36.320 --> 27:38.460]  with a quarter of my health due to you guys,
[27:38.620 --> 27:39.760]  and I haven't died yet.
[27:40.060 --> 27:42.320]  Well, don't worry. Nick's hiding behind something that protects his
[27:42.320 --> 27:42.860]  belt.
[27:46.520 --> 27:48.400]  Alright, so do we want to
[27:48.400 --> 27:50.600]  try that again? Wait, wait, wait! I don't want to drive!
[27:50.860 --> 27:51.380]  Oh, no.
[27:52.360 --> 27:53.920]  Oh, boy. Okay.
[27:54.680 --> 27:55.180]  Oh, boy.
[27:55.860 --> 27:58.240]  Oh, boy. Uh-oh. Okay.
[27:58.880 --> 28:00.540]  Uh-oh. Oh, jeez.
[28:00.820 --> 28:01.380]  Oh, brother.
[28:01.940 --> 28:04.000]  Uh-oh. Alright, I'll tell you what. Let's switch.
[28:04.000 --> 28:04.560]  Yeah!
[28:05.520 --> 28:06.920]  I don't know how you're getting there. Bye.
[28:08.560 --> 28:09.180]  Hold on.
[28:10.120 --> 28:12.160]  Oh, I'm worried about whatever Gavin is cooking up.
[28:13.700 --> 28:16.100]  He's got a mission. Oh, that same guy who beat the shit out of
[28:16.100 --> 28:16.920]  Eric last round is here.
[28:24.290 --> 28:25.090]  Fuck me!
[28:25.370 --> 28:26.290]  I already got him.
[28:29.390 --> 28:30.810]  I was hoping we'd sandwich it.
[28:31.510 --> 28:33.610]  You guys didn't even stop to pick me up.
[28:33.650 --> 28:34.770]  You just fucked me up.
[28:35.770 --> 28:36.110]  Andrew!
[28:38.070 --> 28:38.910]  It's okay, I'm going.
[28:39.210 --> 28:40.610]  Oh, my God, Nick!
[28:41.710 --> 28:42.550]  Get in, Andrew.
[28:43.450 --> 28:44.910]  Okay, I'm coming. Oh, my God!
[28:45.310 --> 28:46.670]  I think we might have failed already.
[28:47.250 --> 28:49.150]  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
[28:49.170 --> 28:50.070]  It's okay, here, I'll pull up.
[28:51.630 --> 28:52.350]  Okay, there we go.
[28:53.090 --> 28:53.710]  Alright, Gavin, you ready?
[28:54.610 --> 28:56.190]  Yep. Fucking do this thing.
[28:57.570 --> 28:57.910]  Okay.
[29:01.810 --> 29:02.150]  Alright.
[29:02.910 --> 29:03.350]  Okay.
[29:05.070 --> 29:05.510]  Oh!
[29:08.050 --> 29:08.490]  Shit!
[29:09.490 --> 29:10.590]  Sorry, Gavin.
[29:10.690 --> 29:11.150]  What happened?
[29:11.650 --> 29:12.690]  I hit him with the car.
[29:16.270 --> 29:18.410]  I was like, let me just give us some more cover,
[29:18.570 --> 29:20.270]  and I rolled right into Gavin.
[29:20.690 --> 29:21.990]  Went right into Gavin.
[29:26.010 --> 29:27.590]  Oh, shit, this car's gonna blow up.
[29:32.420 --> 29:33.000]  Uh-oh.
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.120]  Oh, shit!
[29:34.780 --> 29:35.940]  Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[29:36.640 --> 29:38.880]  Oh, my God, those cars really show up, huh?
[29:40.400 --> 29:41.740]  They're big and red.
[29:42.080 --> 29:42.920]  God damn.
[29:44.460 --> 29:45.640]  Oh, that car's gonna blow up.
[29:46.100 --> 29:47.360]  Yeah, let's get me in the hangar now.
[29:47.720 --> 29:49.260]  Get me in the...
[29:49.260 --> 29:50.340]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[29:51.880 --> 29:53.060]  Okay, we're all in the hangar?
[29:53.560 --> 29:55.040]  Not yet, I'm still outside.
[29:55.180 --> 29:55.620]  There's a lot of people in the car.
[29:55.620 --> 29:56.520]  Nick, get in the hangar.
[29:56.760 --> 29:59.180]  I will, there's a lot of people in the way of said hangar.
[30:01.400 --> 30:03.740]  Well, are you at least not hiding behind anything?
[30:04.300 --> 30:05.260]  I'm hiding behind a wall.
[30:07.100 --> 30:08.220]  Alright, I'm coming in.
[30:08.780 --> 30:09.780]  Gavin, watch your health.
[30:10.720 --> 30:11.600]  Watch my health?
[30:11.740 --> 30:13.180]  Yeah, watch your health. You're already halfway.
[30:13.460 --> 30:14.120]  You're halfway down, no?
[30:14.920 --> 30:15.960]  Yeah, I'm over there.
[30:16.400 --> 30:16.580]  Okay.
[30:17.780 --> 30:19.220]  Nick, they're coming around your side there.
[30:19.660 --> 30:21.640]  I would back up off that corner spot.
[30:21.920 --> 30:22.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:25.220 --> 30:27.020]  Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit!
[30:27.360 --> 30:28.600]  I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.
[30:28.600 --> 30:29.400]  You're okay.
[30:29.480 --> 30:32.340]  I need to fall back, I need to fall back.
[30:32.440 --> 30:35.040]  Then fall back, there might be health back to my left.
[30:35.440 --> 30:36.240]  Oh, there's armor right here.
[30:36.580 --> 30:37.780]  Yeah, yeah, grab it.
[30:37.960 --> 30:38.160]  Done.
[30:41.860 --> 30:43.640]  There's one more guy coming around from the right.
[30:43.920 --> 30:44.620]  Yeah, yeah, you see him.
[30:45.720 --> 30:46.380]  Car coming in.
[30:47.860 --> 30:49.240]  Two cars coming up on that side.
[30:49.800 --> 30:50.840]  Two guys coming left.
[30:51.260 --> 30:52.800]  Can you pick them or no, Nick?
[30:53.100 --> 30:53.780]  I'm gonna try.
[30:55.700 --> 30:57.580]  I chased the one off, okay, circling back.
[30:57.580 --> 30:58.760]  Got him.
[30:59.800 --> 31:00.740]  Can you cross, Gavin?
[31:01.920 --> 31:03.340]  We got three of them coming up.
[31:03.640 --> 31:03.980]  Across?
[31:04.780 --> 31:06.260]  Yeah, from where you were looking before.
[31:06.400 --> 31:08.200]  They're coming to the right side now.
[31:09.320 --> 31:11.040]  Yeah, getting hit a little bit.
[31:11.720 --> 31:12.220]  Falling back.
[31:13.240 --> 31:13.620]  Here they come.
[31:14.420 --> 31:15.300]  Good job.
[31:16.480 --> 31:17.620]  You got him, Nick?
[31:18.260 --> 31:19.180]  Yeah, got him.
[31:20.060 --> 31:21.960]  Okay, we got coming from the right now.
[31:23.660 --> 31:25.540]  Yeah, Gavin and I got the right.
[31:25.540 --> 31:27.000]  Got it, we're watching that left.
[31:28.360 --> 31:29.440]  Dude, these guys could...
[31:29.440 --> 31:29.880]  Whoa!
[31:30.720 --> 31:32.120]  Those guys are right on top of you.
[31:32.940 --> 31:34.400]  Everyone, back up if you need to.
[31:35.680 --> 31:37.120]  There's only a couple guys left.
[31:38.760 --> 31:39.700]  Nick, you got that one?
[31:40.020 --> 31:40.160]  Yeah.
[31:40.980 --> 31:42.720]  There's still a guy right around the corner.
[31:43.900 --> 31:44.260]  I got him.
[31:45.140 --> 31:46.160]  There's one more.
[31:48.240 --> 31:48.880]  Get him in the plane.
[31:49.960 --> 31:50.360]  Get it.
[31:50.800 --> 31:51.620]  Where is he?
[31:52.420 --> 31:53.180]  You don't want to get in?
[31:53.300 --> 31:53.620]  He's up there.
[31:53.900 --> 31:55.560]  I don't think we can.
[31:56.100 --> 31:56.700]  There he is!
[31:59.180 --> 32:00.920]  Let's get back to the armored car if we can.
[32:01.140 --> 32:02.020]  Oh, we didn't take it, did we?
[32:04.140 --> 32:05.020]  Where is this guy?
[32:07.300 --> 32:07.940]  Where is he?
[32:09.100 --> 32:09.660]  Oh, okay.
[32:09.780 --> 32:10.720]  I think I had him for a second.
[32:11.820 --> 32:12.500]  Yeah, he's dead.
[32:14.280 --> 32:15.820]  Are we jumping in a car or what?
[32:15.900 --> 32:16.520]  I think so, yeah.
[32:17.540 --> 32:18.680]  Just grab that one. Nick, I'm with you.
[32:18.680 --> 32:19.300]  Nick, I'm with you.
[32:20.340 --> 32:21.220]  Delivering the vehicle.
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.380]  Gavin, you coming with?
[32:24.160 --> 32:24.900]  Yeah, I'm on the way.
[32:27.540 --> 32:29.740]  How did we not do that ten times in a row?
[32:30.200 --> 32:31.680]  Okay, so he said he's on his way.
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.220]  Alright, we just need to leave.
[32:34.380 --> 32:35.200]  Nah, we should leave together.
[32:37.280 --> 32:38.600]  Yeah, classic heist move.
[32:39.640 --> 32:41.260]  There was no progression in that.
[32:41.400 --> 32:44.220]  We were completely incompetent and then nailed it.
[32:44.360 --> 32:44.420]  Yeah.
[32:44.900 --> 32:47.000]  Alright, now we just have to stay alive
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.640]  until Andrew can deliver the plane.
[32:48.980 --> 32:49.220]  Okay.
[33:01.880 --> 33:02.920]  Holy shit.
[33:03.160 --> 33:04.700]  Oh, nice! Andrew delivered it.
[33:05.340 --> 33:06.260]  Nice job, Andrew.
[33:07.460 --> 33:09.500]  We came in hot, I'm not gonna lie.
[33:09.560 --> 33:09.780]  Cool.
[33:14.730 --> 33:15.650]  Nick's climbing.
[33:16.230 --> 33:17.910]  Nick is just mountain goating this fucking thing.
[33:17.910 --> 33:19.110]  We haven't been to the desert.
[33:20.670 --> 33:21.310]  Yeah!
[33:23.710 --> 33:26.190]  Easy. Fucking baby mode.
[33:27.490 --> 33:28.930]  Oh! Platinum!
[33:29.650 --> 33:31.810]  Damn. Way to go, Andrew.
[33:32.610 --> 33:33.350]  That's what...
[33:33.350 --> 33:35.810]  I got the fuel emission bonus.
[33:36.030 --> 33:37.650]  I got the saving the environment
[33:38.890 --> 33:39.530]  20%.
[33:39.530 --> 33:40.370]  I got an achievement.
[33:41.070 --> 33:44.090]  Set up whatever. Do a heist setup.
[33:44.310 --> 33:45.170]  I told you I've never done this.
[33:45.170 --> 33:45.670]  Congratulations.
[33:46.270 --> 33:47.930]  Did the achievement take you back to the main menu?
[33:48.830 --> 33:49.090]  No.
[33:50.750 --> 33:52.430]  Is that a thing that happened?
[33:52.810 --> 33:53.190]  No.
[33:54.870 --> 33:56.310]  Not in this game.
[33:56.790 --> 33:58.750]  There we are. The rat made himself, baby.
[33:59.530 --> 34:00.030]  Look at him.
[34:00.270 --> 34:02.670]  What a team.
[34:03.230 --> 34:04.350]  Alright, next up.
[34:05.430 --> 34:06.430]  Off we go.
[34:06.670 --> 34:07.630]  Looking good.
[34:07.750 --> 34:09.150]  Wearing cargo shorts.
[34:11.710 --> 34:13.250]  Back in high school.
[34:14.090 --> 34:15.350]  Oh, dear God.
[34:17.210 --> 34:18.270]  Alright, boys.
[34:19.010 --> 34:20.050]  Where are we dropping?
[34:21.610 --> 34:22.070]  No!
[34:23.230 --> 34:23.690]  Eric!
[34:24.870 --> 34:25.750]  Get in, Andrew.
[34:26.790 --> 34:29.170]  The other rule of the road is to hit all...
[34:29.170 --> 34:30.110]  Alright, well, goodbye, Andrew.
[34:32.990 --> 34:34.610]  I can't even not do this.
[34:37.010 --> 34:38.050]  Where's my bike?
[34:38.050 --> 34:38.150]  Oh, jeez.
[34:47.970 --> 34:49.250]  I thirst.
[34:50.190 --> 34:54.790]  Oh, my God!
[34:55.530 --> 34:57.070]  You're on top of me!
[34:57.630 --> 34:57.970]  Move!
[34:58.730 --> 34:59.690]  Now you're alright. Get in.
[35:02.030 --> 35:02.670]  Andrew?
[35:03.070 --> 35:03.730]  Alright, let's go.
[35:04.470 --> 35:05.270]  Oh, Andrew.
[35:06.310 --> 35:07.850]  I want it on my bike!
[35:07.850 --> 35:08.930]  I think I didn't get...
[35:08.930 --> 35:11.250]  Okay, okay. Point proven.
[35:11.670 --> 35:12.750]  Hey, did you get your...
[35:12.750 --> 35:15.150]  Do you have a waypoint now?
[35:15.570 --> 35:16.530]  Yeah, thank you.
[35:18.130 --> 35:19.410]  I'm a teammate, baby.
[35:19.690 --> 35:20.330]  This is how we do it.
[35:22.310 --> 35:23.690]  That person, I hope they're okay.
[35:29.310 --> 35:30.870]  Yeah, this thing hauls ass.
[35:31.210 --> 35:31.870]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[35:34.470 --> 35:35.490]  What is this?
[35:35.490 --> 35:36.650]  Is this like a cool car or something?
[35:37.590 --> 35:38.490]  It's an armored car.
[35:40.070 --> 35:40.930]  How much was it?
[35:40.930 --> 35:41.470]  It was a lot.
[35:42.850 --> 35:45.470]  I think you get it as part of the
[35:45.470 --> 35:46.910]  two-person heist.
[35:47.530 --> 35:49.290]  Oh, there's a two-person heist?
[35:49.930 --> 35:51.650]  Yeah, we skipped that one.
[35:52.470 --> 35:55.530]  Because there's four of us.
[35:58.790 --> 36:02.050]  I once did the first heist
[36:02.050 --> 36:02.710]  with Fiona.
[36:02.710 --> 36:03.810]  Her and me.
[36:04.050 --> 36:06.790]  But she also invited Michael on the calendar invite.
[36:07.290 --> 36:08.390]  And he showed up
[36:08.390 --> 36:10.230]  and we could only do two people
[36:10.230 --> 36:11.550]  so Michael was the radio.
[36:11.910 --> 36:14.410]  Oh, that's awesome. That's really cool.
[36:16.290 --> 36:16.690]  Hey, Gavin.
[36:17.110 --> 36:18.950]  Do you want to get in or are you cool
[36:18.950 --> 36:19.690]  on your own there?
[36:20.150 --> 36:21.810]  How about I get in when you overtake me?
[36:22.830 --> 36:24.070]  That's exactly what I was thinking.
[36:24.710 --> 36:25.830]  I was hoping you'd say that.
[36:27.510 --> 36:28.810]  Gavin does the rules of the road.
[36:30.250 --> 36:31.190]  Oh my god.
[36:31.290 --> 36:32.770]  You fucking destroyed that guy.
[36:33.070 --> 36:34.810]  Well, here's the thing. I had the right of way.
[36:36.110 --> 36:37.210]  We're cruising, baby.
[36:38.290 --> 36:38.970]  This just went
[36:38.970 --> 36:40.990]  to cinema mode. We look sick as fuck.
[36:41.790 --> 36:42.630]  Oh, hell yeah.
[36:43.850 --> 36:44.310]  Let's do it.
[36:44.870 --> 36:46.850]  I have a feeling we're about to see something cinematic.
[36:47.410 --> 36:47.610]  Yup.
[36:48.890 --> 36:50.770]  Fucking know it. This is sick.
[36:51.150 --> 36:52.710]  This is like watching Mission Impossible 7.
[36:52.910 --> 36:54.210]  This is like jamming shit.
[36:54.530 --> 36:54.810]  Uh-oh.
[36:55.550 --> 36:56.250]  Uh-oh.
[36:56.850 --> 36:57.290]  CINEMA!
[37:00.950 --> 37:02.090]  Where's the rabbit's foot?
[37:05.070 --> 37:05.210]  Woo!
[37:05.970 --> 37:07.970]  Alright, Gavin. Hop in.
[37:08.630 --> 37:09.170]  By Faggio.
[37:10.390 --> 37:10.830]  Yeah!
[37:12.390 --> 37:14.190]  Hey, this guy. That was cool.
[37:15.530 --> 37:16.530]  I like that he did that.
[37:17.990 --> 37:18.910]  What did he do, Nick?
[37:19.130 --> 37:20.390]  Nick just has vendettas now.
[37:21.750 --> 37:22.850]  He honked at me.
[37:24.810 --> 37:25.530]  Oh, shit.
[37:26.070 --> 37:27.170]  I have grenades.
[37:28.110 --> 37:29.010]  Where is Andrew?
[37:30.130 --> 37:30.690]  I'm on my way.
[37:32.370 --> 37:34.130]  Oh, the prison bus is moving?
[37:34.790 --> 37:35.530]  Oh, hell yeah.
[37:36.070 --> 37:37.750]  Fire the go-heist flare!
[37:38.170 --> 37:38.930]  Oh my god.
[37:44.510 --> 37:45.510]  Let's do this.
[37:45.810 --> 37:46.610]  Yup, let's jump it.
[37:48.070 --> 37:48.670]  Tree.
[37:50.410 --> 37:51.570]  He called it.
[37:52.070 --> 37:54.070]  It just occurred to me what Gavin said.
[37:54.750 --> 37:55.090]  Yup.
[37:56.390 --> 37:57.930]  Yeah, it was definitely up for interpretation.
[37:58.990 --> 37:59.510]  Alright, keep going.
[37:59.630 --> 38:00.510]  You got it.
[38:01.490 --> 38:04.470]  So, do we have to jump out, or what are we doing?
[38:05.210 --> 38:06.090]  Let's just kill the driver.
[38:06.290 --> 38:06.710]  Pull out in front.
[38:07.970 --> 38:08.330]  Woah!
[38:14.100 --> 38:14.460]  Sir!
[38:16.320 --> 38:16.960]  We got him?
[38:17.840 --> 38:18.380]  Let's get it.
[38:19.700 --> 38:20.560]  Going for it.
[38:24.030 --> 38:25.090]  Why won't you open fire?
[38:25.090 --> 38:26.550]  Oh, right. I can't aim backwards in this.
[38:26.550 --> 38:27.430]  Hop in the bus!
[38:27.630 --> 38:28.730]  I'm in, I'm in, I'm in!
[38:30.750 --> 38:31.710]  Get in, son!
[38:32.530 --> 38:33.330]  Andrew, where are you at?
[38:33.770 --> 38:34.750]  I'm coming to you!
[38:34.970 --> 38:35.850]  He's not even close.
[38:36.790 --> 38:37.930]  I'm a mile away!
[38:39.390 --> 38:40.370]  Oh, you were never here?
[38:40.690 --> 38:41.890]  No, he was never here!
[38:42.130 --> 38:43.770]  I was driving the whole time to get to you!
[38:45.070 --> 38:46.310]  Hang on, there's an escaped prisoner!
[38:47.330 --> 38:47.690]  Not anymore.
[38:49.010 --> 38:50.410]  Not when Cobra's on the case!
[38:52.110 --> 38:53.850]  Take out the aerial escort, guys.
[38:53.850 --> 38:54.370]  Okay.
[38:55.750 --> 38:56.810]  I got that cop.
[38:57.170 --> 39:00.290]  How do I change weapons when I'm in this mode?
[39:00.490 --> 39:01.710]  Thank you.
[39:01.710 --> 39:04.550]  Get the fuck off me, stupid cop car.
[39:07.150 --> 39:08.750]  Does that mean they're swarming, Andrew?
[39:09.230 --> 39:10.090]  We gotta...
[39:10.090 --> 39:11.870]  Nick, we gotta take out the helicopter.
[39:12.370 --> 39:14.050]  I know, I know. I'm trying to get the guys
[39:14.050 --> 39:14.810]  off our backs here.
[39:15.870 --> 39:16.830]  Got him!
[39:18.270 --> 39:20.030]  Time to lose him, boys!
[39:20.750 --> 39:21.570]  Keep going!
[39:24.510 --> 39:25.950]  Alright, let's lose him off-road.
[39:26.170 --> 39:26.410]  Yep.
[39:27.090 --> 39:29.990]  Alright, we'll watch our tail. Take out any cops that are coming.
[39:30.490 --> 39:31.990]  Andrew, run a little
[39:32.370 --> 39:32.730]  distraction.
[39:34.150 --> 39:35.150]  Listen, I got your tail.
[39:37.990 --> 39:38.990]  Okay, we gotta lose the cops.
[39:42.690 --> 39:43.290]  Keep going.
[39:43.410 --> 39:44.350]  Slow going on this hill.
[39:45.350 --> 39:45.870]  It's alright.
[39:48.250 --> 39:49.150]  Keep it going, bud.
[39:49.310 --> 39:51.030]  Oh, you got it. You got it. We're doing great.
[39:52.030 --> 39:52.790]  We're doing great.
[39:53.370 --> 39:54.550]  They'll never catch us
[39:54.550 --> 39:55.210]  if they're ahead of us.
[39:55.590 --> 39:56.770]  Okay, we gotta go left.
[40:01.130 --> 40:02.930]  Gotta go left. Keep going straight.
[40:04.830 --> 40:05.550]  Hold on.
[40:06.430 --> 40:08.370]  Dude, I believe in Gavin, guys.
[40:09.110 --> 40:09.990]  Things have changed.
[40:10.950 --> 40:12.790]  Ooh, I like it.
[40:13.170 --> 40:14.590]  It's not Achievement Hunter anymore.
[40:15.310 --> 40:16.470]  Alright, here we go. Now we're losing him.
[40:16.770 --> 40:18.210]  You gotta go left.
[40:19.150 --> 40:20.210]  There you go.
[40:20.210 --> 40:21.330]  Oh, that's a good one.
[40:21.970 --> 40:23.870]  Keep going. You wanna go up this hill then down this...
[40:23.870 --> 40:25.930]  There you go. Don't quite follow it
[40:25.930 --> 40:26.470]  because they're coming.
[40:27.490 --> 40:29.370]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy!
[40:30.030 --> 40:30.850]  Oh, Gavin!
[40:32.190 --> 40:33.770]  Hit the tree. Come on.
[40:34.990 --> 40:36.410]  Tilt it. Tilt it. Tilt it.
[40:36.510 --> 40:37.570]  Left and right. Left and right.
[40:38.090 --> 40:39.470]  Gas. Gas. Gas. Gas. Gas.
[40:39.830 --> 40:44.010]  Go. Go. He doesn't see us yet.
[40:44.030 --> 40:45.290]  He doesn't see us yet. The ravine.
[40:46.030 --> 40:46.430]  Yes!
[40:46.430 --> 40:49.190]  Oh, you barely
[40:49.190 --> 40:50.110]  cleared that.
[40:50.590 --> 40:51.610]  Wow, Gavin.
[40:52.650 --> 40:54.190]  Wow. We did it. Yeah!
[40:54.570 --> 40:55.890]  We did it. We did it. Okay, we're good.
[40:56.190 --> 40:58.790]  Alright, hang on. Hang on. Let Andrew get in this thing.
[40:59.130 --> 40:59.910]  Yeah, I'm trying to get in.
[41:00.110 --> 41:01.810]  Yeah, stop. Right behind you.
[41:02.650 --> 41:03.590]  Is that my car?
[41:04.450 --> 41:04.850]  Yep.
[41:05.630 --> 41:06.770]  You stole my bike.
[41:08.090 --> 41:09.190]  I stole your car.
[41:09.910 --> 41:12.070]  It happens. I miss my bike. It does.
[41:14.210 --> 41:14.610]  Whoa!
[41:15.610 --> 41:15.790]  Yay.
[41:16.090 --> 41:18.170]  I left my expensive armored car at the scene of the crime.
[41:19.050 --> 41:20.050]  We are going, Gavin.
[41:20.470 --> 41:20.650]  Gavin.
[41:21.870 --> 41:24.070]  You want to turn around and make a U-turn.
[41:24.270 --> 41:26.510]  You want to turn around and make a U-turn.
[41:26.690 --> 41:27.790]  You want to turn the other way?
[41:27.950 --> 41:29.610]  You want to turn around and make a U-turn.
[41:30.190 --> 41:30.510]  Oh, okay.
[41:31.430 --> 41:32.390]  What is going on?
[41:33.810 --> 41:35.830]  Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[41:36.270 --> 41:36.670]  Wait.
[41:38.710 --> 41:39.850]  What is happening?
[41:39.850 --> 41:42.830]  Gavin had to come back and get his stupid bike.
[41:43.070 --> 41:45.230]  I didn't want to leave him on the road.
[41:48.510 --> 41:51.710]  I just had to ignore everything you were saying for so long.
[41:52.710 --> 41:53.510]  Respect it.
[41:53.950 --> 41:54.370]  You know what?
[41:54.450 --> 41:56.150]  You did a great job.
[41:57.330 --> 42:00.350]  Oh, you can try.
[42:05.370 --> 42:06.990]  All you've got to do is get a tire.
[42:06.990 --> 42:08.530]  All you've got to do is get a tire.
[42:09.890 --> 42:12.670]  You think I put all these mirrors on and didn't armor the tire?
[42:12.830 --> 42:13.610]  You guys are crazy.
[42:15.910 --> 42:19.190]  Oh, you did that?
[42:23.090 --> 42:23.770]  Oh, dear.
[42:24.330 --> 42:27.110]  Look at that. That's how you do it.
[42:29.590 --> 42:30.190]  Oh, a flare.
[42:33.290 --> 42:34.130]  Oh, that was close.
[42:39.050 --> 42:40.030]  As was that.
[42:40.170 --> 42:40.590]  That was close.
[42:42.170 --> 42:42.850]  No!
[42:43.810 --> 42:44.490]  Gotcha.
[42:45.350 --> 42:46.030]  Hello?
[42:46.770 --> 42:48.090]  We're going to lose the cops.
[42:49.290 --> 42:50.650]  What happened?
[42:51.390 --> 42:53.070]  Where are the cops on us?
[42:53.830 --> 42:54.770]  On the shooting.
[42:55.010 --> 42:55.650]  Guys!
[43:00.130 --> 43:01.910]  You guys are so slow.
[43:03.450 --> 43:05.470]  It's fine. We're going the right way, naturally.
[43:08.650 --> 43:10.050]  Oh, nice hit.
[43:10.830 --> 43:11.610]  Squish him in there!
[43:14.350 --> 43:16.990]  He just says one star for so long.
[43:17.070 --> 43:18.450]  There's no cops around here.
[43:18.810 --> 43:20.270]  I don't even know if I'm going the right way.
[43:21.250 --> 43:21.810]  I think you are.
[43:21.930 --> 43:22.570]  Follow me.
[43:25.070 --> 43:26.030]  I'm alright.
[43:27.110 --> 43:28.390]  Wait, Nick, did you get out?
[43:28.810 --> 43:29.770]  Yeah, I've got to get my car.
[43:30.510 --> 43:32.210]  What? Who cares?
[43:32.210 --> 43:33.550]  Elephant at the scene of the crime.
[43:34.790 --> 43:35.790]  I'm not wearing gloves.
[43:36.090 --> 43:37.590]  I don't trust Gavin at all.
[43:37.750 --> 43:39.070]  How do we still have one star?
[43:39.790 --> 43:39.970]  Yeah.
[43:41.230 --> 43:42.250]  This is the way.
[43:42.970 --> 43:43.910]  I don't trust you.
[43:44.950 --> 43:45.410]  No!
[43:46.490 --> 43:46.890]  Turn!
[43:48.250 --> 43:49.170]  There's cops!
[43:52.190 --> 43:53.530]  Gavin, you did this.
[43:53.570 --> 43:54.790]  That's what he did.
[43:55.050 --> 43:56.250]  He did that on purpose.
[43:57.110 --> 43:58.450]  I'm at the delivery point.
[43:59.030 --> 44:00.910]  We had a star, you dunce!
[44:01.110 --> 44:03.670]  The cops! You guys led the cops back to my car!
[44:04.070 --> 44:07.050]  You think I'm just sat here without a wanted level with cops on my radar?
[44:07.190 --> 44:07.550]  How does that work?
[44:07.570 --> 44:08.490]  I'm getting shot!
[44:10.290 --> 44:12.730]  Can I get Lester to deal with this?
[44:13.850 --> 44:14.750]  I need a car!
[44:16.070 --> 44:16.510]  Nick!
[44:16.810 --> 44:17.150]  Nick!
[44:17.550 --> 44:19.570]  I don't give a fuck about your car situation.
[44:19.970 --> 44:22.230]  You got out to go get your car.
[44:22.490 --> 44:25.170]  You got out to go get your car.
[44:25.210 --> 44:27.810]  And now we're in the situation that we're in.
[44:28.790 --> 44:29.190]  No!
[44:29.470 --> 44:31.130]  That's horse shit. You followed Gavin.
[44:31.270 --> 44:31.910]  That's you.
[44:33.250 --> 44:34.050]  Oh dear.
[44:34.910 --> 44:35.510]  I'm trying.
[44:35.690 --> 44:35.870]  I'm trying.
[44:38.810 --> 44:40.350]  I can't get Lester out of here.
[44:40.670 --> 44:42.370]  We're in the middle of nowhere.
[44:43.890 --> 44:45.850]  I'm going to see if I can get up these hills.
[44:46.730 --> 44:46.930]  Yeah.
[44:48.750 --> 44:49.390]  I'm going to try.
[44:49.770 --> 44:51.550]  You're driving into the cops again.
[44:51.670 --> 44:52.530]  I didn't see them there.
[44:52.730 --> 44:54.030]  All of a sudden they popped up.
[44:54.690 --> 44:55.630]  Oh, fuck.
[44:55.750 --> 45:00.370]  I just don't know why Gavin did this on purpose.
[45:00.750 --> 45:01.630]  Yeah, why'd you do it, Gavin?
[45:03.710 --> 45:05.470]  You went through your damn flares.
[45:05.630 --> 45:06.590]  We wouldn't be in this predicament.
[45:06.650 --> 45:07.710]  That's actually true, too.
[45:09.450 --> 45:10.910]  Nick's just playing both sides.
[45:11.770 --> 45:12.030]  Yeah.
[45:13.470 --> 45:15.470]  Can't trust this guy as far as you can fucking throw him.
[45:17.350 --> 45:18.710]  I lost the cops. Did you?
[45:19.370 --> 45:20.850]  Nick Switzerland Schwartz.
[45:20.850 --> 45:21.590]  Did you?
[45:21.930 --> 45:24.750]  Do you have the bus that we need to deliver?
[45:25.910 --> 45:26.730]  No, do you?
[45:27.450 --> 45:28.410]  Yes, I do!
[45:30.030 --> 45:32.210]  Whoa, we're just bouncing off everything out here.
[45:32.230 --> 45:33.650]  Oh, fuck, I just hit a tire.
[45:33.750 --> 45:34.470]  Oh, I see you.
[45:34.750 --> 45:35.650]  Do you still have a wanted level?
[45:35.910 --> 45:36.230]  Yes!
[45:38.570 --> 45:40.170]  It's two stars now.
[45:41.050 --> 45:42.150]  There we go, I got it.
[45:42.670 --> 45:43.590]  Okay, good job.
[45:43.770 --> 45:45.070]  He was leading you to the right spot.
[45:46.070 --> 45:46.610]  He was right.
[45:46.610 --> 45:48.370]  He was right. You know what? Gavin, I apologize.
[45:48.750 --> 45:49.570]  I don't.
[45:52.810 --> 45:54.550]  And he's the driver of the vehicle,
[45:54.690 --> 45:55.830]  so his counts for more.
[45:56.010 --> 45:58.270]  So I guess it's not...
[45:58.270 --> 45:59.710]  We're not on good terms, sorry.
[46:00.670 --> 46:02.350]  We're not on good terms!
[46:02.790 --> 46:03.230]  We tried.
[46:05.850 --> 46:06.310]  No!
[46:09.330 --> 46:10.850]  You destroyed it!
[46:10.990 --> 46:12.090]  That got so close.
[46:13.130 --> 46:14.330]  You blew it up!
[46:15.070 --> 46:16.090]  I was so worried
[46:16.090 --> 46:16.770]  it was going to blow up.
[46:17.030 --> 46:20.190]  My mental rage is rising,
[46:20.330 --> 46:20.890]  or whatever.
[46:22.670 --> 46:24.050]  That's two saps
[46:24.050 --> 46:25.730]  and two vehicles you've destroyed of mine.
[46:29.710 --> 46:31.950]  How come the first setup mission
[46:31.950 --> 46:33.550]  was so hard? We did this in one.
[46:36.730 --> 46:39.090]  Silver! Top of the pot, baby!
[46:39.310 --> 46:40.590]  Woo! Platinum!
[46:41.310 --> 46:42.530]  Eh, I don't know about that.
[46:44.870 --> 46:46.390]  I'm gonna get out and get my car.
[46:47.890 --> 46:50.510]  I think I just leveled up, baby. I think I'm level 11.
[46:51.530 --> 46:52.330]  You could almost
[46:52.330 --> 46:53.070]  do this heist.
[46:56.030 --> 46:58.210]  Alright, guys. Thanks for watching.
[46:59.430 --> 47:00.490]  The Rat Gang
[47:00.490 --> 47:01.470]  rides again.
[47:03.090 --> 47:04.170]  We'll see you guys
[47:04.170 --> 47:04.750]  in the next one.
[47:06.190 --> 47:07.310]  Gavin killed me.
[47:08.390 --> 47:10.490]  Oh, grenade! Oh, Eric, your car's
[47:10.490 --> 47:11.210]  got a grenade on it.
[47:14.550 --> 47:15.930]  Alright, guys, go to
[47:15.930 --> 47:18.450]  Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod
[47:18.450 --> 47:20.310]  or Regulatrion.com
[47:20.310 --> 47:21.690]  whatever you like to do.
[47:22.070 --> 47:23.910]  We will see you next time.
[47:25.470 --> 47:26.010]  Alright, hang on.
[47:26.150 --> 47:26.970]  I'm going out right now.
[47:29.550 --> 47:30.610]  Alright, bye!
[47:30.770 --> 47:31.170]  Bye!
