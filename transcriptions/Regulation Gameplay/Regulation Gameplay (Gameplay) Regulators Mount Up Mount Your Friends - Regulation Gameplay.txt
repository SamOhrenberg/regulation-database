[00:00.000 --> 00:03.020]  This is... does somebody want to kick this off? I'll do it.
[00:04.040 --> 00:05.920]  You, the guy, the guy who's played it? Yeah.
[00:06.280 --> 00:09.600]  Well, I mean, you act like I played it like I played it recently.
[00:09.760 --> 00:12.480]  This is like 10 years ago on stage twice, maybe I played it.
[00:12.820 --> 00:14.160]  I've played it zero times.
[00:14.340 --> 00:17.500]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay.
[00:17.800 --> 00:19.480]  This is Mount Your Friends.
[00:19.780 --> 00:23.560]  Andrew picked this for us to play today and then wasn't able to make it.
[00:25.600 --> 00:26.480]  Curious. Curious.
[00:26.920 --> 00:31.320]  Yeah. So as the only one who's familiar with this game, I think I know why.
[00:31.500 --> 00:32.860]  Let's go ahead and start.
[00:33.060 --> 00:34.900]  I remember Cox. Oh, shit.
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.020]  There it is. Oh, that is flapping in the wind.
[00:37.120 --> 00:39.880]  Zayn Petus. Wait. Great. Great name. Who is this? Geoff?
[00:40.220 --> 00:43.200]  Yeah. Yes. Did you pick the egg head? Yeah.
[00:43.520 --> 00:45.240]  Oh, my God. We're on a roll.
[00:46.180 --> 00:48.040]  Did you really? You did not.
[00:48.780 --> 00:50.260]  You did not.
[00:51.220 --> 00:53.460]  You did not. Let's see.
[00:53.980 --> 00:55.100]  Oh, my God.
[00:56.780 --> 00:57.420]  That's amazing.
[00:59.060 --> 01:00.480]  OK, how do I?
[01:01.040 --> 01:02.320]  Oh, God. I got it.
[01:02.480 --> 01:03.800]  I did. Yeah, there you go. Oh, dear.
[01:03.880 --> 01:05.560]  Yep. Oh, I'm in a knot.
[01:06.200 --> 01:07.760]  Yeah. Well, you got an S.
[01:07.860 --> 01:09.540]  You got to work your way over. S, you're A.
[01:09.620 --> 01:11.300]  Oh, my God. And W, you're D.
[01:11.720 --> 01:13.320]  That was kind of horrific. And then S, you're D.
[01:14.160 --> 01:17.840]  If you guys aren't using Xbox controllers, I'd recommend it.
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.520]  I am. I am. Yeah.
[01:21.060 --> 01:22.720]  OK. You just got to get higher than me.
[01:22.800 --> 01:24.280]  You got to get higher than me. You got 30 seconds.
[01:24.280 --> 01:29.520]  Put your A on Geoff's head and then swing your D around to reach up.
[01:29.720 --> 01:31.320]  Yeah. The whole time, S.
[01:31.600 --> 01:33.640]  Put your D on his A. S could be hanging.
[01:34.060 --> 01:35.260]  Now hit start. Hit start.
[01:35.360 --> 01:37.180]  And then hit start. I guess enter, maybe?
[01:37.400 --> 01:38.180]  I don't know. Space?
[01:38.600 --> 01:40.460]  Probably. Yeah, there you go. Holy shit.
[01:40.840 --> 01:42.500]  Oh, man. That point is so much harder than I remember.
[01:43.080 --> 01:44.520]  Because you're not using a controller.
[01:45.080 --> 01:46.360]  Good Lord, Eric. No, I am using a controller.
[01:46.700 --> 01:47.260]  That's horrific.
[01:48.240 --> 01:50.460]  What's the matter? It's Team Ratso.
[01:51.140 --> 01:52.660]  I found it to be pretty hard to guess.
[01:53.440 --> 01:55.000]  What's the issue?
[01:55.480 --> 01:57.700]  Oh, let me be Eric. Do you have a problem with Team Ratso?
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.280]  Put your A up. Move your A up.
[01:59.360 --> 02:00.840]  Yeah, see? Move your A.
[02:00.900 --> 02:01.860]  Oh, I got it. Hit the D.
[02:03.060 --> 02:04.160]  OK, there's this. Touch your ass.
[02:04.180 --> 02:05.340]  You got to get that Y up.
[02:05.460 --> 02:06.820]  Got to get that Y locked in.
[02:06.880 --> 02:07.780]  Just swing that A around.
[02:08.300 --> 02:08.800]  Yeah, dude.
[02:09.340 --> 02:13.380]  I got to swing the B. My B is all over my A.
[02:13.560 --> 02:14.720]  I got a long way to go.
[02:15.600 --> 02:16.160]  There you go.
[02:16.860 --> 02:17.920]  My X on the top.
[02:18.380 --> 02:20.460]  Reach that A all the way up.
[02:20.800 --> 02:21.900]  Boom, baby. Oh, wow.
[02:22.340 --> 02:23.960]  Oh, that's less than ideal.
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.220]  Interesting place to start.
[02:26.140 --> 02:28.120]  Yeah. Oh, I turned my music off, too.
[02:28.180 --> 02:28.840]  I don't know about you guys.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.240]  Oh, me, too. I don't want to listen to that.
[02:30.360 --> 02:31.540]  I don't want to listen to the game music.
[02:31.700 --> 02:32.660]  I think it's single screen.
[02:33.340 --> 02:34.620]  So, yeah, it's got to be.
[02:36.420 --> 02:38.200]  Oh, wow. You're in a big time knot.
[02:38.480 --> 02:40.740]  Yeah, this is less than ideal.
[02:42.940 --> 02:45.600]  It's hard because you forget what button controls what limb.
[02:45.640 --> 02:47.520]  And so you just start looking at it.
[02:47.800 --> 02:48.860]  Oh, nice grab right there.
[02:49.060 --> 02:50.080]  Oh, I got you, dude.
[02:50.080 --> 02:51.460]  A right in the A.
[02:52.320 --> 02:55.040]  I'm in that I'm that sort of age now, though, so it's fine.
[02:55.880 --> 02:58.560]  Yeah, you gotta do it once a year anyway.
[02:58.780 --> 03:01.160]  Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. I want to.
[03:02.640 --> 03:03.520]  Yeah, right there.
[03:03.520 --> 03:04.380]  There you go. Got that.
[03:04.780 --> 03:06.760]  Gavin, did you also pick
[03:08.040 --> 03:09.580]  did you also pick the
[03:10.680 --> 03:15.380]  fucking egg on your head because you could make jokes about dudes coming on you?
[03:15.940 --> 03:17.280]  No, because I thought it was funny.
[03:17.340 --> 03:18.460]  I just thought it was spoke to me.
[03:18.460 --> 03:20.220]  And oh, then me too.
[03:20.220 --> 03:22.680]  Oh, cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.960]  Not much like spider heck.
[03:24.740 --> 03:26.500]  I guess it was what you did, too.
[03:27.520 --> 03:29.660]  Yeah. You and I are all synced up right now.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.600]  Oh, let go, eh?
[03:39.680 --> 03:40.940]  Oh, good scream.
[03:41.060 --> 03:44.180]  W. W. Oh, dear.
[03:46.180 --> 03:48.180]  Nice. All right, Gavin, you're up.
[03:48.180 --> 03:50.800]  Oh, Michael, jerk.
[03:50.860 --> 03:55.160]  You know, this game, this game used to be on the Xbox Live Store
[03:55.920 --> 03:58.940]  and then they removed it in 2015.
[03:59.320 --> 04:01.400]  I think we probably played it on Xbox, Gavin.
[04:01.580 --> 04:03.280]  But if you bought it, you still have it.
[04:03.300 --> 04:04.980]  But you can no longer buy it on too many dicks.
[04:05.360 --> 04:05.900]  What's the deal?
[04:07.060 --> 04:07.660]  Just a couple.
[04:08.600 --> 04:10.380]  I think Xbox is just men bonding.
[04:10.660 --> 04:12.040]  I mean, it's just anti-men bonding.
[04:12.240 --> 04:14.340]  I guess so, man, because that's all that's happening here.
[04:14.400 --> 04:17.440]  Wow. Guys working out, getting in shape, getting to know each other,
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.080]  getting comfortable around other dudes' bodies.
[04:19.400 --> 04:20.560]  I don't know what the fucking problem is.
[04:20.720 --> 04:22.660]  You got it. You got it all the way up. No, no, no. Wrong way.
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.080]  Oh, thanks. There you go.
[04:24.440 --> 04:26.240]  Yeah, yeah. No problem, man. There you go.
[04:26.580 --> 04:28.600]  Oh, look, he's lending you a helping hand.
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.200]  Isn't that fun?
[04:29.800 --> 04:30.500]  Isn't that fun for you?
[04:30.620 --> 04:33.780]  It's like the painting of God reaching his finger out.
[04:33.880 --> 04:36.400]  Yeah. All the way. There you go.
[04:36.580 --> 04:38.980]  Oh, nice. This is bad for Eric.
[04:39.280 --> 04:39.920]  Not good.
[04:40.340 --> 04:42.560]  Yeah, that's a pretty solid jump, though.
[04:42.760 --> 04:43.580]  It was. Thanks, dude.
[04:44.500 --> 04:47.020]  I would say I've been practicing, but I've never played this,
[04:47.020 --> 04:48.260]  so I don't know what I'm doing.
[04:48.520 --> 04:50.920]  I think it looks like it's easier on Wacid.
[04:52.220 --> 04:54.860]  I fucked around with it last night and it didn't seem to be.
[04:57.020 --> 04:59.240]  Are you guys not are you guys all using controllers?
[04:59.580 --> 05:00.680]  Yeah, I'm using a controller.
[05:01.420 --> 05:04.860]  Oh, it's showing me as like it's showing you guys as Wazd or whatever.
[05:05.200 --> 05:05.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.120]  It shows everybody else but you as Wazd, no matter what they're doing.
[05:09.600 --> 05:10.180]  That'll do it.
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.540]  A, there's A.
[05:14.540 --> 05:18.800]  Also, when I was buying this for five dollars,
[05:18.880 --> 05:24.180]  I saw that they have a 3D version that came out later.
[05:24.380 --> 05:28.460]  Maybe if we have so much fun with this, maybe we'll try that as well.
[05:28.580 --> 05:29.540]  We should. I want to try.
[05:29.760 --> 05:32.420]  I want to see who wins this one and get start fucking with like the gravity.
[05:32.600 --> 05:34.960]  Yeah, yeah. I want to go to space and do it in a storm.
[05:36.320 --> 05:38.520]  Well, I want a soggy G string by the end of this.
[05:38.920 --> 05:39.880]  I'm working on one.
[05:39.980 --> 05:41.280]  I bet when I last play this,
[05:41.800 --> 05:44.600]  I didn't think I would be playing this in 2024.
[05:45.180 --> 05:47.300]  You didn't think this was the game that was going to endure?
[05:48.740 --> 05:49.740]  Here you are.
[05:50.420 --> 05:51.960]  All right, let's see. Got a swing.
[05:52.320 --> 05:54.280]  Swing up. Did you like a little spider monkey call?
[05:54.340 --> 05:54.880]  It's so cool.
[05:55.080 --> 05:58.180]  It is. Oh, no, Nick.
[05:58.260 --> 06:02.220]  It might be a little early for this, but you had a full disconnect.
[06:06.060 --> 06:07.180]  Let go. Nice.
[06:07.680 --> 06:09.500]  There you go. Must recover.
[06:09.540 --> 06:10.920]  There you go. Yes. Nice.
[06:10.920 --> 06:13.920]  That's not a bad place for Geoff.
[06:14.360 --> 06:16.060]  Yeah, that was close.
[06:16.140 --> 06:18.000]  Oh, my God. It got so real.
[06:18.500 --> 06:21.480]  Your guy looks stupid. Thank you. Yeah.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.500]  I think my favorite part of this tower is that the only bit
[06:25.500 --> 06:27.760]  that's actually touching the goat is your penis.
[06:28.300 --> 06:29.980]  Yeah, it is. That's pretty cool.
[06:30.200 --> 06:32.540]  That's classic goat stuff, too. You know what I mean?
[06:33.360 --> 06:34.280]  Precarious peen.
[06:36.160 --> 06:37.980]  Oh, what a connection.
[06:38.300 --> 06:40.020]  Excellent. It's so.
[06:40.020 --> 06:41.140]  There you go.
[06:41.500 --> 06:43.340]  You got to do two at once and swing. Big swing.
[06:43.780 --> 06:46.480]  Cliffhanger, cliffhanger, cliffhanger, cliffhanger, cliffhanger, cliffhanger,
[06:46.620 --> 06:47.800]  cliffhanger. Come on. It's the end.
[06:47.980 --> 06:50.100]  Cliffhanger. Cliffhanger. Go. Kill him.
[06:52.360 --> 06:53.620]  Click. There you go.
[06:53.980 --> 06:55.280]  Look at that. Kill him.
[06:55.320 --> 06:57.260]  Chopper's leaving. 17 seconds. Come on, Geoff.
[06:57.980 --> 06:58.980]  Get up there. Cliffhanger.
[06:59.420 --> 07:00.740]  It's the last chopper out of Cliffhanger.
[07:01.560 --> 07:04.580]  Oh, no. Blocked by the rat, baby.
[07:05.820 --> 07:08.100]  Eric's a dirty rat in this game, it turns out.
[07:08.100 --> 07:09.920]  What are you grabbing on to, dude? A little grundle grab.
[07:10.400 --> 07:10.880]  Uh-oh.
[07:12.220 --> 07:13.200]  Damn it. Kill him.
[07:13.520 --> 07:14.680]  Lil' Geoffy eliminated.
[07:14.780 --> 07:15.580]  Oh, you ran out of time.
[07:16.180 --> 07:17.340]  That's a rough side to be on.
[07:17.580 --> 07:18.820]  All right, Gavin, go for it.
[07:18.840 --> 07:19.860]  It's put me on the shy side.
[07:20.420 --> 07:21.460]  That's right, baby.
[07:22.020 --> 07:23.520]  Team Ratso does it again.
[07:26.920 --> 07:28.860]  Well, it was a nice run, Gavin.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.860]  Swing. You want to just go ahead and... What's going on?
[07:32.360 --> 07:34.580]  I mean, you're at the bottom. You can just do whatever.
[07:34.580 --> 07:35.160]  What happened?
[07:36.820 --> 07:38.760]  Gavin, Gavin, you want to go up?
[07:38.920 --> 07:39.180]  Gavin.
[07:39.420 --> 07:40.540]  Gavin, go up.
[07:40.600 --> 07:41.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:41.320 --> 07:42.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:43.160 --> 07:44.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Up.
[07:44.940 --> 07:45.580]  There you go.
[07:45.860 --> 07:46.060]  Yeah.
[07:46.140 --> 07:46.800]  There you go.
[07:47.000 --> 07:47.120]  Yeah.
[07:48.400 --> 07:49.140]  There you go.
[07:49.300 --> 07:49.900]  There you go.
[07:50.560 --> 07:50.860]  Yeah.
[07:51.060 --> 07:53.220]  But my ability to swing is...
[07:53.220 --> 07:54.480]  My leg goes up my ass.
[07:54.600 --> 07:54.960]  Oh, here we go.
[07:55.300 --> 07:55.460]  Yeah.
[07:55.960 --> 07:56.180]  Yeah.
[07:56.420 --> 07:57.260]  Pick your D.
[07:57.520 --> 07:57.800]  Use your arm.
[07:58.060 --> 07:58.860]  And go up.
[07:58.980 --> 07:59.560]  There you go.
[07:59.760 --> 08:00.080]  There you go.
[08:00.100 --> 08:01.280]  Look at you, little spider monkey.
[08:01.380 --> 08:02.040]  You got 15 seconds.
[08:02.060 --> 08:02.680]  Go, monkey, go.
[08:03.040 --> 08:03.960]  Super fucked, dude.
[08:03.960 --> 08:05.720]  This is where you get into the ceiling area.
[08:06.260 --> 08:07.220]  It's hard to get around.
[08:07.400 --> 08:08.180]  Oh, you can do it.
[08:08.280 --> 08:09.400]  You can do it.
[08:09.460 --> 08:10.180]  You got to hurry, Gavin.
[08:10.600 --> 08:11.360]  Climb me.
[08:11.660 --> 08:12.180]  You can do it.
[08:12.500 --> 08:13.200]  Get up there, buddy.
[08:13.360 --> 08:13.800]  Swing it hard.
[08:13.800 --> 08:14.500]  Swing it hard.
[08:14.700 --> 08:15.480]  Swing, swing.
[08:16.880 --> 08:18.360]  Oh, so close.
[08:19.780 --> 08:21.240]  That was unbelievable.
[08:21.960 --> 08:23.400]  Let me get over here real quick.
[08:24.020 --> 08:24.720]  Get that.
[08:25.360 --> 08:26.140]  Boom, boom.
[08:26.440 --> 08:27.400]  Get these out of here.
[08:27.900 --> 08:28.840]  Swing right up here.
[08:28.880 --> 08:30.160]  Pretty easy for me.
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.900]  The guy who's good at this game.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.720]  Go right up.
[08:35.900 --> 08:36.760]  Nice and easy.
[08:36.900 --> 08:37.140]  Boom.
[08:38.000 --> 08:38.360]  Connection.
[08:38.380 --> 08:40.060]  Do a little X and A situation.
[08:40.200 --> 08:41.000]  Swing you over.
[08:41.260 --> 08:42.200]  Boom, boom.
[08:42.580 --> 08:43.060]  Look at this.
[08:43.360 --> 08:43.920]  Look at this.
[08:44.060 --> 08:45.100]  You just got to ride the...
[08:45.100 --> 08:46.300]  Climb the gentle slope up.
[08:47.120 --> 08:47.340]  Yep.
[08:47.940 --> 08:48.300]  Go.
[08:49.000 --> 08:49.640]  Now, what do I want?
[08:49.680 --> 08:50.880]  I think I want Y up here.
[08:51.200 --> 08:52.640]  OK, then I want X and B.
[08:53.340 --> 08:53.980]  That's good.
[08:54.200 --> 08:55.320]  I want B up here.
[08:55.440 --> 08:55.700]  All right.
[08:56.220 --> 08:58.020]  I think I want to stand.
[08:58.160 --> 08:59.400]  I want to sit pretty right there.
[09:00.880 --> 09:01.480]  All right, here we go.
[09:01.560 --> 09:02.420]  All right, Nick, you're fucked.
[09:02.420 --> 09:03.560]  You got it, Nick.
[09:03.720 --> 09:04.680]  Go ahead, lock in.
[09:05.160 --> 09:05.660]  There you go.
[09:05.720 --> 09:06.640]  Swing him on up there, baby.
[09:08.500 --> 09:09.940]  Oh, what a connection.
[09:10.520 --> 09:11.900]  Dude, Spider Monkey Nick.
[09:12.080 --> 09:12.880]  Look at him go.
[09:13.040 --> 09:14.200]  I have the power.
[09:14.700 --> 09:16.040]  Dude, I'm impressed.
[09:16.220 --> 09:16.540]  This...
[09:16.540 --> 09:17.380]  What the fuck?
[09:18.240 --> 09:19.060]  Flying up this thing.
[09:19.060 --> 09:20.100]  He's Van Damme'd.
[09:20.200 --> 09:22.180]  Is Nick pool sharking us right now?
[09:22.600 --> 09:23.800]  Dude, no kidding.
[09:24.740 --> 09:26.200]  36 seconds to go.
[09:26.300 --> 09:27.480]  Suddenly, Nick's fucking...
[09:27.480 --> 09:28.560]  So much time.
[09:29.060 --> 09:30.180]  Sylvester Stallone.
[09:30.180 --> 09:32.340]  Much in my time at the bottom.
[09:32.520 --> 09:33.540]  Look at him go.
[09:34.100 --> 09:35.060]  He's fucking...
[09:35.060 --> 09:36.840]  All right, now how do I want to...
[09:36.840 --> 09:37.180]  Hmm.
[09:37.780 --> 09:38.940]  How do I fuck Eric over?
[09:39.780 --> 09:39.980]  Yeah.
[09:40.160 --> 09:41.420]  Why does Eric have a cat now?
[09:42.320 --> 09:42.920]  He added it.
[09:42.920 --> 09:43.780]  I made a team.
[09:44.300 --> 09:44.660]  Right.
[09:45.200 --> 09:46.040]  Let's see.
[09:46.220 --> 09:47.300]  And then...
[09:47.300 --> 09:48.140]  And then...
[09:48.140 --> 09:48.920]  Crandall.
[09:51.280 --> 09:51.760]  And...
[09:51.760 --> 09:52.880]  Young Crandall.
[09:53.740 --> 09:53.900]  There.
[09:54.860 --> 09:55.520]  All right.
[09:56.220 --> 09:56.380]  Ah!
[09:57.800 --> 09:58.400]  Hang on.
[09:58.860 --> 09:59.400]  Hang on.
[09:59.820 --> 10:01.120]  Yeah, I stuck to the cat.
[10:02.140 --> 10:02.680]  All right, here we go.
[10:03.140 --> 10:03.580]  Hang on.
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.220]  Here we go.
[10:04.520 --> 10:05.120]  There we go.
[10:07.240 --> 10:07.800]  And here we go.
[10:08.740 --> 10:11.180]  Wow, he's got the easiest fucking route to the top.
[10:11.400 --> 10:15.220]  Well, it's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll, Geoff.
[10:15.520 --> 10:16.920]  That's an excellent point.
[10:17.820 --> 10:18.720]  You want to cock and roll.
[10:19.960 --> 10:20.280]  There.
[10:20.960 --> 10:22.000]  Let's get that one here.
[10:22.120 --> 10:22.560]  Lock it in.
[10:22.720 --> 10:23.360]  Lock it in!
[10:23.420 --> 10:23.720]  Yeah.
[10:24.060 --> 10:24.360]  Undo.
[10:24.420 --> 10:24.960]  Don't touch my hand.
[10:24.960 --> 10:25.440]  Lock it in.
[10:25.560 --> 10:26.000]  There you go.
[10:26.020 --> 10:26.340]  There we go.
[10:28.600 --> 10:29.000]  Woo!
[10:29.240 --> 10:30.020]  Look at that.
[10:35.360 --> 10:35.760]  Yes.
[10:35.960 --> 10:37.640]  All right, here we go.
[10:38.780 --> 10:40.240]  Me and Nick are rockin' right now.
[10:40.780 --> 10:42.220]  I might switch to keyboard, yeah?
[10:43.200 --> 10:43.860]  Do you think so?
[10:44.060 --> 10:44.460]  Do it.
[10:44.860 --> 10:46.420]  You think it's going to do better for you?
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.100]  I'd like to think so, considering the people that played this game before are out.
[10:52.120 --> 10:52.720]  No! No!
[10:52.900 --> 10:58.660]  The only reason I used a controller is when I turned the game on, it said,
[10:58.880 --> 11:00.420]  this game is better to play with a controller.
[11:00.420 --> 11:02.460]  Oh, okay.
[11:02.520 --> 11:03.240]  I'll take the hit.
[11:03.420 --> 11:03.720]  Let go.
[11:04.140 --> 11:04.340]  Let go.
[11:04.440 --> 11:09.860]  I think it'd be an interesting addition to the game if other people could wangle your penis while you're climbing.
[11:10.440 --> 11:12.040]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[11:12.720 --> 11:19.200]  Like, like imagine it could have some kind of like influence on which way you go, like it tickles you and then like disconnects a limb.
[11:19.340 --> 11:20.600]  Like you get penis tickles?
[11:20.860 --> 11:21.240]  That's...
[11:21.240 --> 11:21.360]  Yeah.
[11:21.540 --> 11:22.000]  Let's see.
[11:22.120 --> 11:22.840]  Okay, A, Y.
[11:22.920 --> 11:24.920]  Like if I got tickled, I'd let go.
[11:25.520 --> 11:25.600]  B, X.
[11:25.600 --> 11:26.880]  I'd have no choice.
[11:27.140 --> 11:29.100]  I wonder if the developers are working on a new game.
[11:29.360 --> 11:29.660]  Swing!
[11:29.660 --> 11:30.460]  Come on, Nick.
[11:30.560 --> 11:31.160]  Swing your body.
[11:32.000 --> 11:32.740]  You're not going to get it, buddy.
[11:32.800 --> 11:33.760]  No, I'm not going to get it.
[11:33.840 --> 11:34.340]  I'm not going to get it.
[11:34.400 --> 11:34.820]  I'm going to get there.
[11:35.020 --> 11:35.500]  Come on, B!
[11:35.760 --> 11:36.500]  Nick, come on, Nick.
[11:36.560 --> 11:36.580]  Let go!
[11:37.500 --> 11:37.700]  Damn.
[11:38.060 --> 11:38.900]  Eric wins, guys.
[11:39.620 --> 11:40.780]  Eric wins again, baby.
[11:41.040 --> 11:42.180]  Let's do space.
[11:42.360 --> 11:43.320]  Let's do storm.
[11:43.560 --> 11:44.320]  Yeah, storm.
[11:44.780 --> 11:45.000]  And then space.
[11:45.120 --> 11:46.820]  And spawns random.
[11:47.480 --> 11:48.240]  Let's do that.
[11:49.200 --> 11:49.940]  Once everybody's in.
[11:50.020 --> 11:50.480]  All right, here we go.
[11:51.140 --> 11:51.720]  All right, guys.
[11:51.780 --> 11:52.380]  Game two.
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.880]  After Eric wins a hard-fought victory, it looks like Gavin's going first.
[11:57.060 --> 11:57.780]  Waz style.
[11:57.840 --> 11:58.760]  Are you using the mouse and keyboard?
[11:59.080 --> 11:59.340]  Yeah.
[12:00.140 --> 12:00.920]  Oh, I hate it.
[12:00.920 --> 12:01.340]  How's it going?
[12:01.480 --> 12:01.840]  I hate it.
[12:01.840 --> 12:03.800]  So far, seems kind of shitty.
[12:04.220 --> 12:04.940]  You want to S?
[12:05.200 --> 12:05.580]  Yeah.
[12:05.660 --> 12:07.020]  Your D is on S.
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.260]  You want to S your A?
[12:08.480 --> 12:09.680]  I'm telling you, I did.
[12:09.700 --> 12:12.540]  I did keyboard last night for like three rounds just to see.
[12:12.660 --> 12:13.460]  It was fucking hard.
[12:14.160 --> 12:15.680]  Swing your A. Swing your A.
[12:15.760 --> 12:16.720]  Your S is low.
[12:17.320 --> 12:19.680]  Get your D out of the goat's mouth.
[12:20.600 --> 12:22.480]  You can just right-click him in the Discord.
[12:23.260 --> 12:25.940]  It was so annoying that I went into my garage
[12:25.940 --> 12:27.980]  and I looked through all of my old boxes
[12:27.980 --> 12:29.920]  until I found my little Xbox dangle
[12:29.920 --> 12:31.760]  so that I could use a controller on the PC.
[12:32.120 --> 12:34.260]  It's the first game that has...
[12:34.260 --> 12:35.140]  Oh my God.
[12:35.620 --> 12:36.300]  Hey, can I have an invite?
[12:36.320 --> 12:36.660]  What happened?
[12:37.740 --> 12:38.620]  Wait, what happened?
[12:38.820 --> 12:41.020]  I left the game so I could be on controller again.
[12:42.360 --> 12:42.500]  What?
[12:42.560 --> 12:43.760]  I'll fix it. I'll fix it.
[12:44.200 --> 12:44.980]  All right, exit here.
[12:45.080 --> 12:45.760]  We'll exit to menu.
[12:46.160 --> 12:46.920]  We'll just start over.
[12:47.100 --> 12:47.500]  Exit to menu.
[12:48.100 --> 12:48.500]  There you go.
[12:48.700 --> 12:49.480]  Jesus Christ.
[12:49.480 --> 12:50.560]  I thought that'd be way easy,
[12:50.660 --> 12:53.140]  but I forgot what the keys were under my fingers.
[12:55.080 --> 12:58.450]  What happened?
[12:58.730 --> 12:59.130]  Round two.
[12:59.130 --> 13:00.890]  It just closed my game.
[13:03.490 --> 13:05.650]  I tried to join your game and it just went,
[13:05.750 --> 13:07.190]  you got it, and it closed my game.
[13:07.230 --> 13:08.410]  All right, start the new server.
[13:11.010 --> 13:11.630]  Let's go.
[13:12.090 --> 13:12.970]  All right, waiting for Gavin.
[13:13.090 --> 13:13.870]  All right, Gavin, you're first.
[13:14.470 --> 13:15.530]  Let's go, son.
[13:16.010 --> 13:18.210]  If you don't like the way this one goes, just quit again.
[13:18.470 --> 13:18.770]  Oh, yeah.
[13:18.890 --> 13:19.450]  Do you want to...
[13:19.450 --> 13:20.830]  If you don't like the Xbox controller,
[13:21.050 --> 13:24.250]  we can wait while you find a PlayStation controller you can try.
[13:24.350 --> 13:26.510]  If you got like an old Jaguar controller laying around,
[13:26.590 --> 13:27.410]  maybe you want to try that.
[13:27.410 --> 13:28.830]  If you want to try like a joystick, maybe.
[13:28.830 --> 13:29.450]  That was it.
[13:30.630 --> 13:31.610]  Oh, the wind.
[13:33.110 --> 13:33.970]  Oh, the wind.
[13:34.690 --> 13:35.510]  Oh, the wind.
[13:36.430 --> 13:37.310]  It's a little windy.
[13:38.070 --> 13:40.350]  What was that mech flying game Steel Battalion?
[13:40.510 --> 13:41.910]  If you want to try to use that controller.
[13:42.350 --> 13:43.950]  Oh, oh, oh, the wind.
[13:44.330 --> 13:46.110]  I almost lost a friendship over that game.
[13:46.850 --> 13:47.250]  Really?
[13:47.510 --> 13:49.390]  Yeah, my friend bought all the stuff
[13:49.390 --> 13:52.630]  and I kept flicking the thing up and ejecting him while I was playing.
[13:52.630 --> 13:53.230]  What is happening?
[13:54.170 --> 13:54.810]  There we go.
[13:55.170 --> 13:56.690]  That's a lot of money to get ejected.
[13:58.150 --> 14:00.410]  Oh, it disconnected everything.
[14:00.570 --> 14:01.310]  And he was...
[14:01.310 --> 14:02.650]  Stop blowing me!
[14:03.530 --> 14:04.310]  Oh, that's weird.
[14:05.630 --> 14:06.130]  There you go, Nick.
[14:06.470 --> 14:07.070]  You're going to get there.
[14:07.150 --> 14:07.450]  There you go.
[14:07.790 --> 14:08.330]  You got it.
[14:08.370 --> 14:08.950]  Just get on the goat.
[14:09.270 --> 14:09.590]  There you go.
[14:09.670 --> 14:10.030]  You're already higher.
[14:10.290 --> 14:11.290]  OK, that was it, huh?
[14:12.870 --> 14:14.070]  Yeah, good luck.
[14:17.230 --> 14:19.470]  Oh, you have a rupee in your heart hole.
[14:20.270 --> 14:20.730]  Yeah, man.
[14:21.090 --> 14:24.490]  This is Werner Fischela.
[14:25.030 --> 14:25.730]  This is my guy.
[14:27.990 --> 14:28.830]  Looking good.
[14:28.830 --> 14:29.270]  Grabbed on.
[14:29.570 --> 14:30.210]  Looking good.
[14:32.630 --> 14:34.090]  Yeah, I want to get up higher.
[14:34.090 --> 14:34.790]  There we go.
[14:35.430 --> 14:35.930]  He's waiting.
[14:36.010 --> 14:36.210]  Hello.
[14:37.190 --> 14:39.050]  He says, Nolan Gland, come on in.
[14:40.790 --> 14:41.610]  Come on, Nolan.
[14:42.890 --> 14:44.650]  Come on, it looks like someone cummed on your head.
[14:44.730 --> 14:45.150]  It's eggs.
[14:45.570 --> 14:45.910]  It is.
[14:46.650 --> 14:47.350]  It's cummy eggs.
[14:47.950 --> 14:50.030]  Something's wrong with that guy.
[14:51.570 --> 14:54.490]  Oh, what a move.
[14:55.030 --> 14:55.650]  That was phenomenal.
[14:55.650 --> 14:57.150]  You can do it, Geoff.
[14:58.190 --> 15:00.410]  Look at him reach out his little fucking limbs.
[15:01.190 --> 15:01.590]  You got it.
[15:01.610 --> 15:02.330]  You got locked on.
[15:02.550 --> 15:03.650]  Oh, look at you.
[15:04.710 --> 15:08.390]  I think we got to start going straight up and not off to the side.
[15:08.490 --> 15:10.970]  When I did that in the last game, it was absolutely an accident.
[15:11.110 --> 15:12.570]  And I didn't know that that's what we were doing.
[15:12.630 --> 15:13.250]  That was an accident.
[15:13.550 --> 15:14.290]  That was an accident.
[15:14.430 --> 15:16.370]  It was perfectly played to fuck us over.
[15:16.490 --> 15:17.210]  Yeah, I know.
[15:17.450 --> 15:20.590]  And I had no, I have no idea that that was like the game.
[15:20.710 --> 15:22.170]  OK, well, apologize for doing that.
[15:23.150 --> 15:23.890]  No, I won.
[15:23.970 --> 15:24.530]  There's no apology.
[15:31.110 --> 15:31.610]  Oh, no.
[15:31.790 --> 15:32.110]  There you go.
[15:32.530 --> 15:32.970]  There you go.
[15:33.010 --> 15:33.670]  There you go.
[15:33.830 --> 15:34.330]  Got it.
[15:34.370 --> 15:35.850]  You fucking sack.
[15:37.230 --> 15:37.810]  Got it.
[15:39.410 --> 15:40.110]  Oh, shit.
[15:40.450 --> 15:40.850]  Oh, God.
[15:41.850 --> 15:42.750]  Look at my mustache.
[15:46.900 --> 15:47.260]  Yep.
[15:47.300 --> 15:47.880]  All the way, man.
[15:47.920 --> 15:48.460]  Got it.
[15:49.000 --> 15:49.500]  There you go.
[15:49.720 --> 15:50.320]  Come on.
[15:50.320 --> 15:50.440]  Come on.
[15:50.460 --> 15:51.560]  Stop grabbing all the shit.
[15:51.780 --> 15:51.920]  Yep.
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.300]  All right, there you go.
[15:55.120 --> 15:56.200]  Now put your hands in the air.
[15:57.720 --> 15:58.900]  There you go.
[15:58.900 --> 16:00.040]  There we go.
[16:00.040 --> 16:00.600]  All right.
[16:00.740 --> 16:01.720]  Nick, it started you on the nice side.
[16:01.840 --> 16:02.520]  It sure did.
[16:02.540 --> 16:03.880]  It's so much the better side.
[16:04.200 --> 16:08.700]  Watching both of you guys get started on the nice side means I'm guaranteed to get a shitty side.
[16:09.260 --> 16:09.660]  Guaranteed.
[16:09.940 --> 16:11.540]  I'm on the bad side for naughty boys.
[16:12.380 --> 16:13.380]  Oh, grab the egg.
[16:13.560 --> 16:14.100]  Grab the cum head.
[16:14.860 --> 16:15.640]  Grab the cum head.
[16:19.730 --> 16:21.030]  Look at the head.
[16:21.870 --> 16:22.290]  There we go.
[16:22.590 --> 16:22.830]  All right.
[16:22.850 --> 16:23.170]  There you go.
[16:23.250 --> 16:23.690]  Swing that.
[16:23.890 --> 16:24.670]  There we go.
[16:24.810 --> 16:26.230]  I got your cummy little head.
[16:26.490 --> 16:28.410]  All right.
[16:28.470 --> 16:29.010]  Swing that.
[16:29.010 --> 16:29.710]  There we go.
[16:31.250 --> 16:31.990]  Yep, almost.
[16:32.550 --> 16:33.550]  Oh my god.
[16:34.550 --> 16:34.950]  Crazy.
[16:36.070 --> 16:37.470]  Now Eric gets the good side.
[16:37.570 --> 16:38.470]  I'm so fucked.
[16:39.370 --> 16:41.090]  Maybe just switch sides back and forth.
[16:41.750 --> 16:42.330]  Super fucked.
[16:42.430 --> 16:42.870]  It does not.
[16:43.330 --> 16:44.770]  Oh, it's random.
[16:45.010 --> 16:45.510]  It's random.
[16:45.970 --> 16:48.370]  Oh, I thought last game it was back and forth.
[16:48.470 --> 16:49.670]  Last night, last game was alternating.
[16:49.930 --> 16:50.070]  Yeah.
[16:50.870 --> 16:51.610]  I'm hanging on.
[16:51.910 --> 16:52.490]  Dear life.
[16:56.620 --> 16:56.840]  Pretty good.
[16:56.880 --> 16:57.460]  Oh, I like that.
[16:57.620 --> 16:58.060]  There you go, Geoff.
[16:58.520 --> 16:59.160]  Oh, there we go.
[16:59.260 --> 16:59.400]  Yep.
[16:59.600 --> 17:00.020]  Oh, wow.
[17:00.040 --> 17:00.680]  You're on the good side.
[17:00.680 --> 17:01.360]  Good boys.
[17:02.400 --> 17:02.900]  Uh-oh.
[17:03.020 --> 17:04.820]  Maybe they've deemed the other side completely impossible.
[17:05.540 --> 17:05.720]  Yeah.
[17:06.860 --> 17:09.580]  I guess we'll find out on the next turn, which is you, right?
[17:09.780 --> 17:11.280]  Oh, now he's getting wedged under me there.
[17:11.720 --> 17:12.780]  Yeah, that's not good.
[17:13.420 --> 17:13.860]  There you go, Geoff.
[17:13.880 --> 17:14.320]  You got it.
[17:14.380 --> 17:15.080]  There you go, buddy.
[17:15.380 --> 17:17.260]  Look at you swinging, swinging, dinging.
[17:17.660 --> 17:18.520]  Oh, look at you hanging.
[17:21.260 --> 17:22.660]  Can we put this on YouTube?
[17:23.800 --> 17:25.100]  I think we did in the past.
[17:25.700 --> 17:26.960]  It might not have any ads.
[17:27.240 --> 17:28.640]  Right, in the past.
[17:30.400 --> 17:31.720]  Wow, all the way up.
[17:31.720 --> 17:32.620]  Oh, no, shit side bullshit.
[17:35.440 --> 17:36.820]  I think we can.
[17:37.060 --> 17:38.320]  Maybe this is a Patreon exclusive.
[17:39.120 --> 17:39.420]  Maybe.
[17:39.960 --> 17:43.880]  Well, when it's up, leave a comment and let us know where we put it up.
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.220]  Yeah, let us know where you're watching it from and then we'll know where we put it.
[17:47.500 --> 17:50.760]  Yeah, if it's on Patreon, leave us a comment that says, this is on Patreon.
[17:51.080 --> 17:51.800]  I got news for you.
[17:51.820 --> 17:53.000]  We won't remember this conversation.
[17:53.760 --> 17:54.520]  Fuck, no.
[17:56.360 --> 17:57.580]  Wow, what a move.
[17:58.400 --> 17:59.780]  That was great, dude.
[18:00.360 --> 18:01.820]  Oh, he's going for it.
[18:01.860 --> 18:02.240]  Gav, no.
[18:02.260 --> 18:03.340]  He's going for it.
[18:03.560 --> 18:03.580]  No!
[18:05.200 --> 18:06.120]  Who the hell's that?
[18:06.720 --> 18:07.180]  It's me.
[18:07.400 --> 18:07.780]  It's Ivan Beerman.
[18:09.860 --> 18:11.020]  Come on, Ivan.
[18:11.300 --> 18:11.900]  Work, Ivan.
[18:12.640 --> 18:13.440]  Come on, Ivan.
[18:13.500 --> 18:14.180]  There you go, you're on.
[18:15.620 --> 18:16.660]  He's on the pile.
[18:18.100 --> 18:19.480]  Oh, look at this swing.
[18:19.580 --> 18:20.540]  What a move.
[18:21.960 --> 18:22.460]  Uh-oh.
[18:22.960 --> 18:23.480]  S and A.
[18:23.880 --> 18:24.680]  You got it.
[18:25.420 --> 18:26.020]  Got it.
[18:26.080 --> 18:26.580]  Here we go.
[18:26.580 --> 18:27.800]  Uh-oh, there you go.
[18:28.620 --> 18:29.400]  Here we go.
[18:30.160 --> 18:30.440]  Yep.
[18:30.640 --> 18:31.000]  Uh-oh.
[18:31.240 --> 18:32.180]  Oh, Nick.
[18:32.520 --> 18:33.300]  You're killing it.
[18:33.300 --> 18:33.940]  You got it, you got it.
[18:34.200 --> 18:34.820]  Feeling good.
[18:36.420 --> 18:37.740]  Wow, what a move.
[18:38.580 --> 18:39.300]  Dick on my shoulder.
[18:39.540 --> 18:40.420]  Yeah, on your shoulder.
[18:41.060 --> 18:42.160]  All right, swing up.
[18:42.320 --> 18:43.360]  Monkey on the call.
[18:43.600 --> 18:43.880]  Rabbit.
[18:44.640 --> 18:45.480]  Here we go.
[18:45.820 --> 18:47.480]  Okay, and let's see.
[18:47.620 --> 18:48.860]  Good one.
[18:49.100 --> 18:49.560]  Let's see.
[18:50.320 --> 18:50.700]  Y.
[18:52.140 --> 18:52.420]  B.
[18:53.600 --> 18:54.400]  Oh, look at that.
[18:54.580 --> 18:56.500]  Oh, Nick's doing a breakdance.
[18:57.020 --> 18:57.960]  Oh, yeah.
[18:58.320 --> 19:00.180]  Just broke every bone in my body.
[19:00.660 --> 19:01.500]  Popping and locking.
[19:01.880 --> 19:03.040]  Looking like ozone.
[19:06.380 --> 19:09.240]  This early 80s breakdancing reference is real.
[19:09.700 --> 19:10.040]  I got it.
[19:10.080 --> 19:10.440]  It's pretty good.
[19:10.740 --> 19:11.020]  Thank you.
[19:11.720 --> 19:12.400]  I liked it.
[19:15.320 --> 19:15.740]  Hi-ya!
[19:16.100 --> 19:16.300]  Okay.
[19:16.540 --> 19:17.500]  This dexterity.
[19:18.020 --> 19:22.220]  This music is far too sophisticated for this, I feel like.
[19:23.880 --> 19:25.140]  Nick, I've turned the music off.
[19:25.140 --> 19:26.780]  I cannot listen to it and concentrate.
[19:27.240 --> 19:27.260]  It's terrible.
[19:27.480 --> 19:32.940]  I still don't know how to output music or output sound to my capture and also my ears at the same time.
[19:33.520 --> 19:35.700]  I also don't have that going.
[19:35.700 --> 19:36.400]  Don't you do this professionally?
[19:36.900 --> 19:38.760]  Yeah, but I've got a new setup.
[19:39.620 --> 19:39.940]  Oh.
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.280]  And it seems like Windows likes to output to one device at a time.
[19:45.400 --> 19:45.540]  It sure does.
[19:45.580 --> 19:46.220]  It's tough.
[19:46.420 --> 19:48.680]  Instead of just like, how about whatever I want?
[19:50.180 --> 19:51.740]  Was that a problem you were doing?
[19:51.740 --> 19:55.780]  When you were streaming pinball, did you have to like listen for sounds or anything?
[19:55.920 --> 19:57.560]  Or was that like a no headphone situation?
[19:58.260 --> 19:58.940]  No, I could hear.
[19:59.020 --> 20:02.180]  I just had it low enough to not pick up in my mic.
[20:03.060 --> 20:03.420]  Nice.
[20:04.220 --> 20:05.520]  And then I direct captured.
[20:06.540 --> 20:07.800]  Look at this going right here.
[20:08.000 --> 20:08.520]  Look at Denny East.
[20:08.520 --> 20:09.720]  Look at that swinging dong.
[20:10.620 --> 20:11.120]  Yeah, dude.
[20:11.700 --> 20:12.540]  I swing some dong.
[20:13.340 --> 20:14.100]  I hang dong.
[20:15.220 --> 20:16.040]  I'm hanging dong.
[20:16.760 --> 20:20.060]  I had a friend that showed me a picture of his balls hanging out of his shorts and he said,
[20:20.060 --> 20:21.720]  Oh man, it looks like I sat in spaghetti.
[20:21.920 --> 20:24.360]  And I think about that the whole time we're playing this game.
[20:24.560 --> 20:26.880]  It looks like I sat in spaghetti.
[20:27.580 --> 20:30.260]  Oh man, I sat in spaghetti.
[20:30.640 --> 20:32.840]  I feel like people's balls used to come out a lot more.
[20:32.960 --> 20:33.280]  Oh no!
[20:33.480 --> 20:33.720]  Yeah.
[20:33.920 --> 20:34.500]  I agree.
[20:34.960 --> 20:40.060]  It seemed it, I think, I think after like the 80s into like maybe like the mid 90s,
[20:40.220 --> 20:41.180]  it's just out of vogue.
[20:41.880 --> 20:45.120]  I think what happened is somewhere in like 2005,
[20:45.400 --> 20:48.540]  they just they figured out you could put lining in shorts for dudes too.
[20:48.860 --> 20:50.260]  And now balls are protected.
[20:50.660 --> 20:52.860]  Balls are just it's not like you sat in spaghetti.
[20:53.140 --> 20:56.980]  Yeah, I have to like, I'm at a point now where if I buy a pair of shorts,
[20:57.020 --> 20:59.520]  there's like a 70% chance it's going to have some sort of a lining in it,
[20:59.580 --> 21:00.420]  whether I want it to or not.
[21:00.720 --> 21:01.740]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[21:02.060 --> 21:04.380]  They're like, it feels so much like wearing swim trunks.
[21:04.480 --> 21:05.120]  Yeah, all the time.
[21:05.320 --> 21:05.740]  Going out.
[21:05.960 --> 21:08.880]  Yeah, you're like, I'm going to go eat at the restaurant and wear my swimmies.
[21:10.340 --> 21:11.640]  I never know where you're going to take a dip.
[21:13.380 --> 21:14.020]  God damn.
[21:15.080 --> 21:15.720]  19 seconds.
[21:15.960 --> 21:16.620]  I went to get there.
[21:16.620 --> 21:19.560]  I went to the Kirby Lane on Kirby Lane today.
[21:19.720 --> 21:20.620]  Oh yeah, you've never been there?
[21:21.140 --> 21:21.260]  Nice.
[21:21.460 --> 21:22.380]  No, no, no, I've been there before.
[21:22.460 --> 21:23.680]  It's just been like a really long time.
[21:26.160 --> 21:26.660]  It's nice.
[21:26.720 --> 21:27.900]  It's way nicer than the one at like Mueller.
[21:28.120 --> 21:30.220]  Oh, yeah, it's way nicer than the other ones.
[21:30.400 --> 21:32.060]  Well, I mean, it's got more personality.
[21:32.440 --> 21:33.620]  It's yeah, it's the ambiance.
[21:33.840 --> 21:37.000]  The one at Mueller is like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.900]  It's eating, eating at the one at Mueller is like eating like a snooze.
[21:41.120 --> 21:43.720]  It's just like, it's just cool.
[21:43.720 --> 21:47.780]  I'm having breakfast somewhere where everyone's doing business.
[21:47.920 --> 21:49.000]  I don't like it.
[21:49.260 --> 21:49.860]  I don't like it.
[21:50.220 --> 21:52.680]  I feel like the food is also better at that location.
[21:53.780 --> 21:57.220]  We parked, we rolled up, parked right in front, walked right.
[21:57.380 --> 21:58.620]  It was like, holy shit.
[21:59.760 --> 22:00.540]  I got the migas.
[22:00.780 --> 22:02.700]  I wanted to get something that was like, oh, nice and easy.
[22:02.780 --> 22:06.120]  But really what I got was four cups of coffee in 40 minutes.
[22:06.240 --> 22:07.920]  And then he's like, do you want a cup of coffee to go?
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.460]  So I've had five cups of coffee.
[22:09.540 --> 22:10.240]  Hell yeah, son.
[22:10.240 --> 22:10.680]  That was today.
[22:10.900 --> 22:11.460]  So good.
[22:11.860 --> 22:12.620]  Yeah, you're crazy.
[22:12.620 --> 22:17.740]  If I, if, if I don't stop myself, I will only drink coffee all day long.
[22:17.820 --> 22:18.540]  Yeah, I have to.
[22:18.720 --> 22:21.180]  I have a limit where my body starts to reject coffee.
[22:21.340 --> 22:23.120]  I just have a sip and then my body's like that.
[22:23.180 --> 22:24.740]  You didn't like that sip very much.
[22:25.520 --> 22:25.880]  Yes.
[22:26.060 --> 22:27.960]  Oh, Nick, what a save.
[22:28.160 --> 22:30.380]  Gavin, do you remember the thing you would always get there?
[22:30.440 --> 22:31.640]  I would always get the migas as well.
[22:31.900 --> 22:33.240]  But I used to get the Paris, Texas.
[22:33.600 --> 22:36.020]  Yeah, I was always impressed that you would get that.
[22:36.340 --> 22:38.120]  Yeah, I probably shouldn't get it anymore.
[22:38.740 --> 22:39.580]  For the audience.
[22:39.580 --> 22:43.580]  It's it's a full order of migas and a full order of pancakes.
[22:43.780 --> 22:44.080]  Is that right?
[22:44.240 --> 22:44.680]  French toast.
[22:44.800 --> 22:45.480]  French toast.
[22:46.480 --> 22:47.880]  How did I remember that?
[22:50.700 --> 22:51.120]  Oh, my wife.
[22:51.180 --> 22:51.860]  Fucking good, though.
[22:52.160 --> 22:53.040]  Fucking good.
[22:53.640 --> 22:54.660]  It's so good.
[22:54.880 --> 22:55.940]  It's so good.
[22:56.660 --> 23:01.220]  Probably took like maybe a day and a half of my life every time I ate one of those.
[23:01.520 --> 23:01.920]  No.
[23:02.840 --> 23:07.180]  I feel like, I feel like Kirby Lane is where Bernie Burns and I always end up getting lunch
[23:07.180 --> 23:08.340]  when he's in town for some reason.
[23:08.360 --> 23:08.460]  Oh, really?
[23:08.880 --> 23:09.240]  Is that right?
[23:09.240 --> 23:10.740]  I guess that's like his place.
[23:13.740 --> 23:15.080]  Oh, you got it.
[23:15.280 --> 23:16.740]  Eric, you got to get out of this thing.
[23:17.000 --> 23:17.380]  No, no.
[23:18.120 --> 23:19.360]  Eric might be out of this thing.
[23:19.620 --> 23:20.740]  He's got too many connections.
[23:21.220 --> 23:22.420]  Got too many connections.
[23:22.640 --> 23:23.440]  Swing it fast.
[23:23.960 --> 23:24.740]  Oh, you got it.
[23:24.820 --> 23:25.220]  I got it.
[23:25.300 --> 23:25.820]  Let go, let go.
[23:26.360 --> 23:26.800]  Yes.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.660]  I would not want to be me right now.
[23:30.740 --> 23:31.680]  And I don't.
[23:32.880 --> 23:35.720]  Do you find yourself saying that kind of like throughout the day?
[23:35.940 --> 23:36.840]  Oh, most days.
[23:37.540 --> 23:39.520]  It's kind of like, you know how people have a mantra?
[23:40.520 --> 23:40.660]  Yeah.
[23:40.820 --> 23:41.760]  I would say that's mine.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.360]  I don't want to be me right now.
[23:43.520 --> 23:45.860]  I would not want to be me today, but I am.
[23:45.980 --> 23:47.280]  So we're just going to go with it.
[23:47.660 --> 23:51.160]  I feel like that sometimes when I have a bunch of house stuff going wrong,
[23:51.200 --> 23:53.680]  I wake up and I'm like, I wonder what it's going to be like to be me today.
[23:54.180 --> 23:54.440]  Yeah.
[23:55.260 --> 23:57.200]  You showed us what went wrong today.
[23:57.280 --> 23:59.180]  And that, that blew my fucking mind.
[23:59.500 --> 24:03.260]  I can't fucking wait till we record the podcast today because there is so much to talk about.
[24:03.640 --> 24:04.000]  Yeah.
[24:04.140 --> 24:06.880]  Just so you guys know, on the day that we're recording this gameplay,
[24:07.600 --> 24:09.900]  we have two podcasts that we're going to be doing today.
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.320]  And there's a lot to cover.
[24:11.940 --> 24:12.980]  Nick, you don't even know, man.
[24:13.200 --> 24:13.580]  Oh shit.
[24:13.680 --> 24:13.920]  Really?
[24:14.480 --> 24:14.560]  You have some clips.
[24:15.040 --> 24:15.200]  Yeah.
[24:15.400 --> 24:16.940]  Oh, you have clips?
[24:17.320 --> 24:19.520]  Oh, he absolutely has footage.
[24:19.600 --> 24:19.960]  Oh, oh yeah.
[24:20.000 --> 24:20.660]  You have footage.
[24:20.860 --> 24:21.180]  Get up there, Geoff.
[24:21.180 --> 24:22.780]  I thought it was clips where someone's in trouble.
[24:22.980 --> 24:23.580]  Yeah, that's yeah.
[24:23.780 --> 24:24.100]  Come on, Geoff.
[24:24.100 --> 24:24.580]  You got it.
[24:24.700 --> 24:24.860]  Geoff.
[24:25.100 --> 24:25.640]  Come on, Geoff.
[24:26.060 --> 24:26.320]  Swing.
[24:26.580 --> 24:27.240]  Grab my cat.
[24:27.760 --> 24:27.960]  Geoff!
[24:28.000 --> 24:28.820]  I couldn't get it.
[24:29.960 --> 24:30.960]  All right, Gavin.
[24:31.760 --> 24:32.220]  Oh shit.
[24:32.620 --> 24:33.100]  Make us proud.
[24:33.900 --> 24:34.780]  Oh, wow.
[24:36.700 --> 24:37.520]  Unintentional something.
[24:41.260 --> 24:42.140]  Help me, sir.
[24:43.780 --> 24:45.000]  Let go of that, you fool.
[24:45.420 --> 24:45.940]  Come on.
[24:48.080 --> 24:49.160]  Oh no!
[24:51.940 --> 24:53.580]  It's starting to get dicey.
[24:53.940 --> 24:54.840]  Oh dear.
[24:55.100 --> 24:55.600]  You idiot.
[24:55.740 --> 24:56.840]  I forgot how to play.
[24:57.660 --> 24:57.960]  Ah.
[25:00.240 --> 25:00.840]  Oh.
[25:01.700 --> 25:02.900]  Come on.
[25:03.000 --> 25:03.580]  You got it.
[25:06.180 --> 25:07.380]  Oh god.
[25:07.820 --> 25:08.680]  Oh god.
[25:08.900 --> 25:09.360]  Oh god.
[25:09.740 --> 25:10.980]  It's B! Stop pressing A!
[25:13.580 --> 25:15.720]  Ah, I'm pressing the wrong shit!
[25:16.520 --> 25:17.980]  Why? Don't do that.
[25:18.480 --> 25:19.780]  You freaking...
[25:20.400 --> 25:24.960]  It's always annoying to watch me play stuff, like watching it back, but to live it.
[25:24.960 --> 25:27.420]  Right now, I'm really annoyed at myself.
[25:27.520 --> 25:28.960]  It's the fucking worst, dude.
[25:29.140 --> 25:30.680]  I suck shit!
[25:30.880 --> 25:32.200]  Uh-oh, it's up to me now.
[25:32.500 --> 25:32.780]  Moron.
[25:34.280 --> 25:35.860]  There we go, Nick. You got it.
[25:36.020 --> 25:37.120]  All right, here we are.
[25:38.840 --> 25:41.840]  To date this even more, the White Sox fired their...
[25:43.940 --> 25:46.960]  Grady Sizemore has been named interim White Sox manager.
[25:48.220 --> 25:51.760]  Every day is a bad day to wake up and be a White Sox fan.
[25:52.340 --> 25:53.380]  It's rough, dude.
[25:53.380 --> 25:56.660]  That was a playoff contention team like four years ago.
[25:56.880 --> 25:57.920]  Maybe four years ago.
[25:58.020 --> 25:59.100]  It was one where people were like,
[25:59.260 --> 26:01.940]  oh wow, look at how much they have under contract through like 2025.
[26:02.320 --> 26:03.520]  And they don't have any of those guys anymore.
[26:03.520 --> 26:05.520]  Oh my god, all they have is Lubob, I think.
[26:06.000 --> 26:06.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:08.180 --> 26:09.140]  There we go.
[26:09.860 --> 26:10.960]  Okay, all right.
[26:11.140 --> 26:13.620]  I don't know how, but this is all Tony LaRusso's fault still.
[26:14.220 --> 26:14.780]  Yeah, I agree.
[26:14.980 --> 26:15.900]  You know what? Totally fair.
[26:16.940 --> 26:17.060]  Yep.
[26:17.640 --> 26:18.280]  Let go!
[26:20.140 --> 26:20.700]  There you go, Nick.
[26:20.880 --> 26:22.160]  15 seconds. You got plenty of time.
[26:22.280 --> 26:22.560]  Come on.
[26:23.680 --> 26:24.360]  Swing up!
[26:24.880 --> 26:25.780]  Oh, you got this, Nick.
[26:25.920 --> 26:26.380]  You got it.
[26:26.460 --> 26:26.880]  You got this.
[26:26.880 --> 26:28.260]  I feel good. Hold on.
[26:28.580 --> 26:29.040]  Uh-oh.
[26:29.580 --> 26:30.100]  Oh no.
[26:30.800 --> 26:31.200]  Uh-oh.
[26:32.160 --> 26:33.400]  Nope, just gonna end it.
[26:33.520 --> 26:33.740]  Okay.
[26:34.900 --> 26:37.200]  So Emily finished The Sopranos last night.
[26:37.840 --> 26:38.260]  Oh, cool.
[26:38.340 --> 26:38.640]  And I watched it.
[26:39.600 --> 26:40.340]  She loved it.
[26:40.480 --> 26:42.860]  I watched the last couple episodes with her because I...
[26:42.860 --> 26:45.380]  I don't know if you guys remember when season six came out,
[26:45.420 --> 26:47.560]  but it was fucking like two years between episodes.
[26:47.720 --> 26:48.220]  It was annoying.
[26:48.600 --> 26:49.700]  And I just gave up.
[26:49.740 --> 26:50.660]  I just didn't give a shit anymore.
[26:50.660 --> 26:53.680]  So I read how it ended, but I never saw the last season,
[26:53.920 --> 26:55.640]  or most of like last half of last season.
[26:55.800 --> 26:58.520]  I had no idea how many people fucking die.
[26:58.600 --> 26:59.720]  I'm not trying to spoil anything.
[27:00.080 --> 27:02.120]  How many people fucking die at the end of that show?
[27:02.280 --> 27:03.160]  Holy shit.
[27:03.680 --> 27:05.020]  Yeah, it's crazy. It's a lot.
[27:05.060 --> 27:06.080]  Oh my god, don't worry, Gavin.
[27:06.100 --> 27:07.120]  I won't spoil it, but...
[27:07.120 --> 27:08.620]  It's a good season. Great season, season.
[27:09.360 --> 27:12.360]  Don't worry, most of the people who die in my season probably weren't even in season three,
[27:12.480 --> 27:13.480]  but like fucking...
[27:13.480 --> 27:14.520]  It's insane.
[27:14.740 --> 27:15.120]  Uh-oh.
[27:15.520 --> 27:16.940]  Oh, Eric could be pissing this away.
[27:17.660 --> 27:18.320]  I could be.
[27:18.580 --> 27:19.100]  I might be.
[27:19.200 --> 27:19.860]  This could be...
[27:20.660 --> 27:23.080]  A, there we go, B and X.
[27:23.180 --> 27:27.300]  In good news though, the Phillies won the series against the Dodgers.
[27:27.440 --> 27:28.520]  I hate the Dodgers.
[27:28.600 --> 27:29.220]  Yeah, me too.
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.240]  We're only three games back from the Dodgers too, so I feel bad.
[27:31.240 --> 27:33.640]  Oh, Eric with a mean addition to the hype.
[27:34.060 --> 27:35.820]  Dodgers are just dealing with some injuries right now.
[27:35.880 --> 27:36.360]  They'll be back.
[27:37.020 --> 27:37.700]  The Dodgers?
[27:37.920 --> 27:38.740]  Yeah, they're fine.
[27:39.100 --> 27:39.540]  I wouldn't worry about it.
[27:40.080 --> 27:45.280]  The Padres and the Diamondbacks at the time of this recording are only three games back.
[27:45.340 --> 27:47.460]  Yeah, we just said Dodgers just got Freddie Freeman back.
[27:48.180 --> 27:49.200]  They're like...
[27:49.200 --> 27:51.940]  It's like watching the Angels with Shohei where it's just like,
[27:52.020 --> 27:53.340]  man, this guy's really doing it all.
[27:53.420 --> 27:54.900]  They lost five to three.
[27:55.380 --> 27:58.100]  It took me 20 seconds to get to the stack.
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.460]  No, there's plenty of time.
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.220]  He's all knotted up too.
[28:02.660 --> 28:03.760]  Oh, no!
[28:06.140 --> 28:07.080]  Yeah, don't give up.
[28:07.420 --> 28:08.800]  You can't lose, please.
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.380]  I'm panicking.
[28:11.640 --> 28:12.140]  I'm panicking.
[28:12.280 --> 28:12.920]  I'm just hitting buttons.
[28:13.280 --> 28:13.760]  I'm just...
[28:13.760 --> 28:14.880]  I'm just throwing lint.
[28:15.040 --> 28:15.300]  Please.
[28:15.700 --> 28:16.260]  I'm panicking.
[28:16.660 --> 28:17.200]  Grab the grass.
[28:17.660 --> 28:19.180]  Jesus, it's the wind.
[28:19.520 --> 28:20.360]  Let me die.
[28:21.480 --> 28:22.460]  Let me die.
[28:26.300 --> 28:28.120]  You didn't even make it.
[28:28.400 --> 28:29.300]  You didn't even make it.
[28:29.440 --> 28:30.400]  Oh, my God.
[28:30.620 --> 28:32.580]  Full speed, no gas, no brakes, go Nick.
[28:32.580 --> 28:33.520]  No brakes, go.
[28:34.380 --> 28:35.580]  Oh, man.
[28:36.480 --> 28:36.860]  Congratulations, Eric.
[28:37.240 --> 28:38.240]  All right, once again, boys.
[28:38.380 --> 28:41.780]  All right, I want to play low gravity.
[28:42.040 --> 28:44.700]  Let's see what happens when I return to the lobby and if I let it count down.
[28:44.860 --> 28:45.580]  Nice, hell yeah.
[28:45.660 --> 28:46.240]  We don't have to do it.
[28:46.300 --> 28:46.460]  Okay.
[28:46.460 --> 28:48.680]  Can you change the environment?
[28:49.020 --> 28:49.640]  Yes, I can.
[28:49.720 --> 28:49.900]  I can.
[28:50.040 --> 28:50.160]  Okay.
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.400]  So I'm going to change to the only other environment we have, space.
[28:53.840 --> 28:54.820]  That's what I'm looking for.
[28:55.080 --> 28:55.400]  And then...
[28:55.400 --> 28:56.640]  And then sponsor random.
[28:56.640 --> 28:57.700]  Random, I think makes the most sense.
[28:57.700 --> 28:58.520]  I thought that was really fun.
[28:58.620 --> 28:58.800]  Yeah.
[28:58.960 --> 28:59.100]  Yeah.
[28:59.500 --> 29:00.520]  All right, boys, let's do it.
[29:00.580 --> 29:01.100]  Nick, you're up.
[29:01.220 --> 29:01.680]  Oh, no.
[29:01.920 --> 29:02.740]  All right, here we go.
[29:02.800 --> 29:03.240]  Let's see.
[29:03.320 --> 29:03.480]  Why?
[29:03.540 --> 29:04.560]  You just start on the goat, dude.
[29:04.560 --> 29:05.040]  This is easy.
[29:07.720 --> 29:08.360]  Oh, wow.
[29:08.740 --> 29:10.280]  It wants you to go up.
[29:10.720 --> 29:11.600]  Uh, how do I...
[29:13.500 --> 29:18.240]  Live without you, will you ever know?
[29:20.120 --> 29:21.760]  All right, Gavin, you got it.
[29:21.760 --> 29:23.860]  How do I live without you?
[29:24.960 --> 29:29.600]  Nope, nope, nope, nope, yep, yep, yep.
[29:29.600 --> 29:30.640]  How will I ever survive, Geoff?
[29:31.020 --> 29:31.680]  There you go.
[29:32.280 --> 29:33.540]  There you go, Gavin.
[29:38.560 --> 29:41.280]  Gavin, locked in, not saying a fucking word.
[29:41.380 --> 29:43.360]  I want to put my hand on Nick's balls.
[29:43.660 --> 29:44.100]  Yeah, Gavin.
[29:46.680 --> 29:47.760]  That was pretty good.
[29:47.920 --> 29:49.860]  No, Gavin's cupping the balls.
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.260]  No glory hole necessary.
[29:51.680 --> 29:51.880]  Oh, man.
[29:52.420 --> 29:53.620]  Oh, nice flip, dude.
[29:53.680 --> 29:54.400]  That was a cool move.
[29:54.740 --> 29:55.340]  Now you're showing off.
[29:55.540 --> 29:56.720]  I thought I did that for you.
[29:56.740 --> 29:57.480]  I thought you'd like that.
[29:57.540 --> 29:57.840]  I did.
[29:58.360 --> 29:59.740]  I appreciate a little bit of showmanship.
[30:00.480 --> 30:02.560]  Hey, are we not doing our thing with Gus this week?
[30:03.060 --> 30:04.060]  Uh, no, I don't think so.
[30:04.160 --> 30:04.360]  Okay.
[30:04.580 --> 30:05.980]  My timing is really...
[30:05.980 --> 30:07.760]  My dog is getting a bunch of teeth pulled right now.
[30:09.600 --> 30:10.320]  That's so sad.
[30:12.960 --> 30:13.520]  There we go.
[30:15.480 --> 30:16.680]  Ah, cheeks to egg.
[30:16.900 --> 30:18.820]  I'm not looking to be the tallest.
[30:19.020 --> 30:20.900]  I'm looking to get in weird positions on this one.
[30:21.500 --> 30:22.940]  Gavin, you've inspired me.
[30:24.080 --> 30:24.440]  Damn.
[30:26.380 --> 30:29.680]  There should be bonus points awarded for most penis rotations.
[30:30.220 --> 30:31.580]  Yeah, that's for creativity.
[30:33.180 --> 30:34.860]  Yeah, they called and they're like,
[30:34.900 --> 30:37.220]  hey, we're cleaning your dog's teeth and he's not gonna have...
[30:38.380 --> 30:39.340]  We're gonna pull a lot of teeth.
[30:39.780 --> 30:40.500]  It's like, oh, okay.
[30:41.720 --> 30:43.600]  My dog, uh, my dog, Jupiter.
[30:43.740 --> 30:45.120]  I had a Great Dane for a while.
[30:47.340 --> 30:49.980]  God took him from me, but, uh...
[30:49.980 --> 30:50.900]  That wasn't a Great Dane.
[30:51.580 --> 30:52.620]  I don't know why I said Great Dane.
[30:52.720 --> 30:53.240]  I'm sorry, St. Bernard.
[30:55.760 --> 30:56.600]  I had a St. Bernard.
[30:56.900 --> 30:59.280]  He loved the dog so much and he'll never forget him or her.
[30:59.660 --> 31:01.440]  I just misspoke, but they're both big dogs.
[31:01.500 --> 31:05.700]  But I had a 165-pound St. Bernard and he had almost no teeth.
[31:06.340 --> 31:07.300]  And it was sad.
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.320]  It was hard for him to eat and it made a mess.
[31:09.320 --> 31:12.200]  So you have, uh, maybe a mess ahead of you.
[31:12.460 --> 31:13.360]  Yeah, definitely.
[31:13.880 --> 31:14.580]  Poor little guy.
[31:14.900 --> 31:15.300]  Poor little guy.
[31:15.620 --> 31:17.120]  But you love him and it doesn't matter.
[31:17.660 --> 31:18.900]  You still take care of him.
[31:19.680 --> 31:19.840]  Yep.
[31:20.500 --> 31:23.140]  Albert's a giant pain in the ass right now, but I still love him.
[31:23.220 --> 31:23.800]  Yes, he is.
[31:24.280 --> 31:24.940]  What's he doing?
[31:25.520 --> 31:28.660]  He's just full of energy and doesn't understand personal space.
[31:28.700 --> 31:31.420]  Being an evil, a small, big, little evil monster.
[31:31.600 --> 31:32.660]  He's also full of piss.
[31:33.540 --> 31:34.420]  He's, uh...
[31:35.320 --> 31:37.080]  The pisses will slow down a little bit.
[31:37.080 --> 31:38.880]  But the thing is, now he's just like...
[31:38.880 --> 31:39.640]  He's like a little...
[31:40.500 --> 31:43.720]  He's like a little engine that wants to go full speed at all times.
[31:43.860 --> 31:44.000]  Yeah.
[31:44.400 --> 31:47.800]  And he's compact, but he's dense, you know?
[31:47.880 --> 31:49.820]  It's like getting hit by a Buick when he runs into you.
[31:50.000 --> 31:50.680]  He's hench.
[31:51.600 --> 31:52.220]  He's hench.
[31:52.340 --> 31:53.040]  He's very hench.
[31:53.100 --> 31:56.240]  Every time I see him, I leave with new giant scratches on my legs.
[31:57.160 --> 31:58.620]  And you just go, I mean, it's a dog.
[31:58.840 --> 31:59.660]  It's a dog. What can you do?
[32:00.400 --> 32:02.220]  And you're like, I don't want you to be that kind of dog.
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.200]  Yeah, but like...
[32:04.200 --> 32:04.520]  It's hard.
[32:04.520 --> 32:07.080]  That's just what it is for right now.
[32:07.180 --> 32:07.780]  Yeah, they're puppies.
[32:07.920 --> 32:08.940]  He's not going to be like that forever.
[32:09.180 --> 32:09.320]  Yeah, no.
[32:09.320 --> 32:09.960]  That's just what he...
[32:09.960 --> 32:10.860]  Like, that's, you know...
[32:10.860 --> 32:11.640]  He's still pupping it up.
[32:11.660 --> 32:12.600]  That's how dogs learn and whatnot.
[32:12.600 --> 32:13.700]  He's the best. I love him.
[32:13.700 --> 32:14.180]  My, uh...
[32:14.180 --> 32:19.820]  My peopleized dog is being driven insane by a fly that's in the house right now.
[32:20.020 --> 32:20.900]  He hears it.
[32:20.940 --> 32:21.060]  Is that right?
[32:21.200 --> 32:21.460]  Yeah.
[32:21.820 --> 32:24.800]  At our old house, he was able to get into the blinds and he could destroy them.
[32:24.900 --> 32:27.760]  He would single-handedly kill them all by himself.
[32:27.980 --> 32:31.960]  But now, in this other house that we have...
[32:31.960 --> 32:34.060]  Or that we got during the pandemic...
[32:35.700 --> 32:37.640]  He cannot get into the window.
[32:37.800 --> 32:39.280]  So he just runs around going...
[32:45.160 --> 32:47.600]  I'm not really noticing the gravity very much.
[32:48.000 --> 32:48.980]  You aren't?
[32:49.360 --> 32:51.460]  It's definitely more floaty.
[32:54.380 --> 32:55.740]  Oh, shit!
[32:55.840 --> 32:56.380]  There it is.
[32:56.740 --> 32:57.740]  Yeah, that was some gravity.
[32:58.140 --> 33:00.160]  The fall is a bit slower, it seems.
[33:00.820 --> 33:01.220]  Ah!
[33:03.960 --> 33:04.360]  Oh!
[33:05.660 --> 33:07.460]  Look at that sack position.
[33:07.780 --> 33:08.760]  Yeah, you're hogging it, too.
[33:08.920 --> 33:09.600]  That's your hog stack.
[33:09.780 --> 33:11.420]  Man, you're getting footed up.
[33:12.020 --> 33:14.640]  Have you guys noticed that there's no television anymore?
[33:15.660 --> 33:16.060]  Yes.
[33:16.360 --> 33:17.140]  It's fucking lame.
[33:17.660 --> 33:18.560]  There's nothing to watch.
[33:18.560 --> 33:20.840]  I've been on that train for a while, man.
[33:20.880 --> 33:24.200]  You guys talk about reality TV, and it's like, man, that's so out of my realm.
[33:24.340 --> 33:26.260]  There's not even reality TV right now, really.
[33:27.260 --> 33:27.740]  It's just...
[33:27.740 --> 33:29.260]  Wasn't Love Island supposed to be good?
[33:29.340 --> 33:29.980]  The American one?
[33:30.160 --> 33:31.120]  Yeah, but I watched it.
[33:31.380 --> 33:31.480]  Oh.
[33:31.800 --> 33:33.060]  What about Milf Manor, Geoff?
[33:33.600 --> 33:34.920]  I couldn't get into it. I tried.
[33:35.280 --> 33:35.780]  Yeah, I couldn't either.
[33:36.360 --> 33:38.600]  I watched a half an episode, and I just... it was...
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.440]  You know, with a title like that, you'd expect it to be a little bit more interesting.
[33:44.500 --> 33:45.140]  Yeah, something.
[33:45.520 --> 33:47.540]  Yeah. I agree.
[33:48.600 --> 33:49.320]  I'm just gonna crawl.
[33:49.680 --> 33:50.620]  I've just been watching movies.
[33:50.780 --> 33:50.940]  Got it.
[33:51.060 --> 33:53.780]  I've been on Beverly Hills Cops.
[33:54.640 --> 33:56.200]  Yeah, I wish I liked movies still.
[33:57.260 --> 33:59.380]  Yeah, I haven't sat down to watch a movie in ages.
[33:59.940 --> 34:02.460]  I need to watch the Steven Seagal movie for work.
[34:04.160 --> 34:04.960]  Which one?
[34:05.120 --> 34:05.880]  I saw Trap.
[34:06.440 --> 34:07.180]  Oh, was it good?
[34:09.220 --> 34:09.940]  Most of it.
[34:10.700 --> 34:11.440]  Oh, most of it.
[34:11.680 --> 34:13.700]  It's called General Commander, the one I'm gonna watch.
[34:13.760 --> 34:15.380]  But what do you mean most of Trap is good?
[34:15.500 --> 34:15.920]  Was it...
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.700]  It didn't stick to landing?
[34:17.860 --> 34:18.640]  I just did.
[34:22.340 --> 34:25.280]  It was just... it's a movie that, like...
[34:25.280 --> 34:28.040]  I'm so invested in two-thirds of the way through,
[34:28.040 --> 34:31.980]  and then one sentence is spoken, the movie takes a turn,
[34:32.080 --> 34:33.840]  and you just go, hmm, I don't think I like this.
[34:34.880 --> 34:36.920]  That movie, to me, I think I said this to you guys in...
[34:37.820 --> 34:39.480]  like, hanging out, one of you at least,
[34:39.560 --> 34:42.660]  but that movie, to me, looks like M. Night Shyamalan had to take his daughter
[34:42.660 --> 34:44.960]  to a Taylor Swift concert and was bored to death
[34:44.960 --> 34:47.160]  and was like, I'm gonna make a movie in my head
[34:47.160 --> 34:49.300]  while I have to sit through this fucking concert.
[34:49.980 --> 34:53.780]  It's definitely where the premise comes from,
[34:53.860 --> 34:55.600]  and the premise is very interesting,
[34:55.600 --> 34:58.680]  and sort of, like, the cat-and-mousiness of it is very cool,
[34:58.980 --> 35:02.440]  and then it keeps going, and you're like,
[35:02.600 --> 35:05.260]  surely this is the end, they can't keep going from here,
[35:05.420 --> 35:07.780]  and boy, do they, and they shouldn't have,
[35:07.980 --> 35:09.020]  and it's really something.
[35:09.760 --> 35:12.080]  M. Night Shyamalan, I feel like we talked about this recently too,
[35:12.140 --> 35:14.940]  but he just, he is better with less budget.
[35:15.320 --> 35:15.420]  Yeah.
[35:15.700 --> 35:16.860]  Yes, absolutely, yeah.
[35:17.500 --> 35:18.980]  Oh, fuck, this is a tough side right here.
[35:20.980 --> 35:24.520]  I would recommend most of that movie, though.
[35:24.520 --> 35:24.740]  Okay.
[35:24.740 --> 35:26.900]  Like, I think it's, I think the beginning,
[35:27.100 --> 35:29.240]  like, the first two-thirds are, like, so good.
[35:30.260 --> 35:32.540]  Like, I was so invested, and then so disappointed.
[35:32.880 --> 35:34.480]  Like, so, so disappointed.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.820]  Yeah, but if I know it's gonna end bad, now I don't wanna see it.
[35:37.960 --> 35:38.460]  Yeah, right.
[35:38.520 --> 35:40.800]  Yes, and that, I totally understand.
[35:40.900 --> 35:43.700]  It's why I love Game of Thrones so much,
[35:43.740 --> 35:44.740]  but I can't watch it anymore,
[35:44.820 --> 35:46.840]  because I know none of the stories end well.
[35:47.200 --> 35:51.020]  If anything, you're doing us a huge favor by telling us not to see it.
[35:51.160 --> 35:52.780]  Yeah, it's really a bummer.
[35:52.780 --> 35:55.560]  If I watch it, and then I don't like it.
[35:55.580 --> 35:56.280]  Oh, look at that!
[35:56.740 --> 35:57.560]  I hit a dab.
[35:57.940 --> 36:00.560]  I see very few movies, and if this is one of the ones I see, and it sucks,
[36:00.640 --> 36:01.680]  I'm gonna be really annoyed with it.
[36:01.940 --> 36:02.900]  Yeah, I get that.
[36:03.360 --> 36:04.240]  I'm gonna go see...
[36:05.240 --> 36:06.520]  It doesn't, I mean, I can say it now,
[36:06.580 --> 36:08.500]  because no one's gonna fucking go.
[36:08.620 --> 36:10.680]  There's a movie, a Hong Kong action movie,
[36:10.720 --> 36:12.700]  called Twilight of the Warriors Walled In.
[36:12.860 --> 36:13.440]  Oh, that sounds cool.
[36:13.440 --> 36:15.100]  That is showing it, Alamo.
[36:15.260 --> 36:16.100]  Is it new or old?
[36:16.440 --> 36:17.420]  I'm going with Blaine.
[36:17.600 --> 36:19.380]  It's, it's like, it's a new movie.
[36:20.160 --> 36:22.140]  Don't cause trouble in the walled city.
[36:22.140 --> 36:23.620]  And it just, it looks like a cool action movie.
[36:23.620 --> 36:25.360]  Oh, is it about Kowloon Walled City?
[36:26.320 --> 36:27.160]  I don't know.
[36:27.400 --> 36:29.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[36:29.120 --> 36:30.100]  Because if it is, I want to see it.
[36:30.160 --> 36:31.340]  I'm, I'm obsessed with that place.
[36:31.640 --> 36:32.880]  Yeah, that's a crazy place.
[36:33.060 --> 36:34.080]  Did you ever play Hitman, Geoff?
[36:34.500 --> 36:36.720]  No, I never played it, but I would if it's in it,
[36:36.740 --> 36:38.500]  because that, that, that city doesn't exist anymore.
[36:38.620 --> 36:40.940]  And I've watched every documentary on YouTube about it I can find.
[36:41.200 --> 36:43.420]  The first three levels are in Kowloon.
[36:44.340 --> 36:45.060]  Oh, shit.
[36:45.880 --> 36:47.000]  The original Hitman.
[36:47.260 --> 36:48.240]  Like Hitman 1.
[36:48.580 --> 36:50.780]  Hitman codenamed 47, only on PC.
[36:50.780 --> 36:52.300]  Oh, well, never mind.
[36:52.820 --> 36:54.140]  For maybe a thousand.
[36:54.840 --> 36:56.300]  Maybe we'll play this for a video.
[36:57.220 --> 37:00.280]  Tomorrow at 9 30 p.m. at Alamo Village.
[37:00.780 --> 37:02.180]  When, when did the movie come out?
[37:03.060 --> 37:05.460]  Jordan Swearser, I think it's like out now.
[37:05.500 --> 37:06.420]  Like it just came out.
[37:06.740 --> 37:08.080]  You lost me at Jordan Swears.
[37:11.080 --> 37:11.760]  I'm kidding.
[37:12.060 --> 37:14.320]  I say that because Jordan Swears is one of the nicest people on earth.
[37:16.020 --> 37:16.620]  That's funny.
[37:17.460 --> 37:19.120]  How do I want to...
[37:19.120 --> 37:19.760]  What's it called again?
[37:20.180 --> 37:20.400]  Whoa.
[37:22.420 --> 37:23.080]  Hang on.
[37:23.460 --> 37:24.080]  Oh, it's Gavin's turn.
[37:24.160 --> 37:24.520]  I thought it was mine.
[37:25.340 --> 37:28.100]  It is called Twilight of the Warriors.
[37:28.760 --> 37:29.900]  I'll probably just try to catch it online.
[37:30.500 --> 37:30.940]  Yeah.
[37:31.820 --> 37:32.820]  I get it.
[37:33.520 --> 37:37.600]  But the idea of walled in and it's taking place in a walled city is like fucking cool.
[37:38.140 --> 37:42.700]  You know the thing about that city too, Eric, is that it was never official or legal.
[37:42.940 --> 37:47.620]  It was just like the people just kind of made it over some abandoned buildings
[37:47.620 --> 37:51.040]  and the government kept telling them to leave and then they would come back and come back
[37:51.040 --> 37:55.120]  and eventually they gave up and there were thousands and thousands of thousands of people
[37:55.120 --> 38:00.020]  living there in like an unincorporated illegal city and then eventually the government came
[38:00.020 --> 38:04.120]  and bulldozed the whole thing because it was a huge fire hazard, wasn't it?
[38:04.200 --> 38:04.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:04.800 --> 38:05.500]  It was very dangerous.
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.660]  But like many, many, many thousands of people living in essentially like a society
[38:12.420 --> 38:16.540]  self-governed and self-regulated because they, you know, they were kind of operating
[38:17.200 --> 38:18.520]  off the grid as it was.
[38:18.540 --> 38:23.500]  It's just so cool how it was built. Like they used every inch of that footprint.
[38:24.160 --> 38:24.640]  Wow.
[38:24.820 --> 38:25.200]  So impressive.
[38:25.520 --> 38:27.640]  Wow. That's fucking cool.
[38:28.120 --> 38:32.900]  I'm excited to see what happens in this crazy action movie inside the city where you can't escape.
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.380]  It was a German documentary I watched about a dude on YouTube who just went through it
[38:38.380 --> 38:42.280]  and interviewed people and talked to shop owners and went into houses and shit and it's just so
[38:42.280 --> 38:42.680]  fascinating.
[38:43.100 --> 38:44.020]  When did it go?
[38:45.140 --> 38:46.720]  Like early 2000s, maybe?
[38:48.300 --> 38:50.480]  Oh, that's a penis on my ear.
[38:52.800 --> 38:54.900]  I told you I'm a weird positions guy in this one.
[38:55.760 --> 38:56.880]  Yeah, in this one.
[39:01.440 --> 39:03.940]  You know how you're like the God of War guy, Nick?
[39:04.540 --> 39:04.780]  Yeah.
[39:05.180 --> 39:08.400]  You know, I've been playing God of War on my personal streams, 2018 God of War.
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.920]  When does that game actually end?
[39:11.560 --> 39:13.500]  It is so fucking long.
[39:13.500 --> 39:15.160]  And I've been playing it for a month.
[39:15.240 --> 39:16.060]  It is long.
[39:16.160 --> 39:20.180]  You have to you have to do just the main story and not any of the side quests.
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.840]  I really liked the extra stuff, though.
[39:24.940 --> 39:27.980]  I liked all the Niflheim, like, smoke world shit.
[39:28.280 --> 39:29.120]  I thought it was so cool.
[39:30.020 --> 39:30.700]  That sounds fun.
[39:31.140 --> 39:32.000]  I don't hate it.
[39:32.600 --> 39:36.320]  I just want to be able to finish it and it just doesn't seem to end.
[39:36.920 --> 39:40.260]  Are you doing any of the side stuff like with the Valkyries?
[39:40.780 --> 39:41.980]  Yeah, I've done some of it.
[39:42.780 --> 39:47.000]  Dude, that that that last boss is still the hardest thing in that.
[39:47.220 --> 39:48.240]  I never in the first one.
[39:48.300 --> 39:51.100]  I never actually beat that because I refused to turn the difficulty down.
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.140]  And I just, oh, yeah, I got spaced.
[39:55.840 --> 39:56.540]  Careful, man.
[39:56.740 --> 39:57.620]  They don't let go.
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.160]  Don't hit all four buttons at once.
[39:59.800 --> 40:00.500]  Space will take you.
[40:00.740 --> 40:01.280]  Oh, space.
[40:02.880 --> 40:04.640]  What did Geoff just say, Nick?
[40:07.620 --> 40:08.760]  All right, here we go.
[40:09.360 --> 40:10.780]  Oh, got it.
[40:10.780 --> 40:12.540]  Get right in the crev.
[40:16.920 --> 40:18.500]  Doing his own sound effect.
[40:18.680 --> 40:19.040]  Sorry.
[40:21.740 --> 40:22.520]  Look at that.
[40:22.980 --> 40:23.640]  Here we go.
[40:23.880 --> 40:24.320]  Oh, shit.
[40:25.960 --> 40:26.400]  You got it.
[40:26.540 --> 40:26.840]  You got it.
[40:26.840 --> 40:27.520]  You have so much time.
[40:27.780 --> 40:29.940]  Swing your legs out.
[40:30.740 --> 40:31.300]  Now your arm.
[40:31.480 --> 40:31.660]  There you go.
[40:31.780 --> 40:32.200]  Wahoo!
[40:34.340 --> 40:35.180]  Classic Mario.
[40:36.460 --> 40:37.040]  Let's see.
[40:37.120 --> 40:37.680]  How can I?
[40:39.960 --> 40:41.340]  Like you're waving to us.
[40:41.420 --> 40:42.360]  We see you.
[40:42.480 --> 40:42.720]  Yes.
[40:42.840 --> 40:43.280]  Hi.
[40:43.300 --> 40:43.540]  Hi.
[40:43.580 --> 40:43.820]  Hello.
[40:43.940 --> 40:44.220]  Hello.
[40:44.220 --> 40:45.060]  Yeah, we see you.
[40:45.080 --> 40:45.740]  We're waving back.
[40:45.840 --> 40:46.020]  OK.
[40:46.180 --> 40:46.820]  Camera overstay.
[40:47.000 --> 40:47.480]  He let go.
[40:47.640 --> 40:48.360]  Oh, he let go.
[40:48.440 --> 40:49.180]  Did you see that?
[40:49.240 --> 40:49.760]  He did.
[40:50.400 --> 40:50.760]  Uh-oh.
[40:52.520 --> 40:53.400]  There we go.
[40:53.800 --> 40:54.240]  No!
[40:57.600 --> 40:58.980]  You bastard, man.
[41:00.320 --> 41:01.040]  Oh, man.
[41:01.080 --> 41:03.380]  I got to remember that's the fucking thumbnail right there.
[41:03.740 --> 41:03.840]  Whoa!
[41:04.440 --> 41:05.780]  Gavin, what a move.
[41:05.780 --> 41:08.580]  I want to make more use of the no gravity.
[41:09.140 --> 41:10.540]  Yeah, you're doing great right there.
[41:10.640 --> 41:10.780]  Boom.
[41:10.920 --> 41:11.480]  Uh-oh.
[41:13.240 --> 41:13.680]  Wow.
[41:14.280 --> 41:14.720]  Wow.
[41:16.260 --> 41:17.340]  No, no, no.
[41:17.400 --> 41:17.920]  Reach out.
[41:22.240 --> 41:23.060]  You got it.
[41:23.960 --> 41:24.400]  Yep.
[41:25.300 --> 41:26.560]  I got ahead of myself.
[41:26.680 --> 41:27.960]  I thought I had more skill than I do.
[41:30.320 --> 41:30.980]  Uh-oh.
[41:31.700 --> 41:32.280]  There you go.
[41:32.640 --> 41:33.640]  X and A, you moron.
[41:34.440 --> 41:39.020]  Most of this game is just getting mad at yourself for hitting the wrong button.
[41:39.020 --> 41:40.120]  Yeah, oh, definitely.
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.300]  Wow, there's a pile of dicks on heads up here.
[41:42.320 --> 41:43.260]  Oh, Gavin, don't hit.
[41:43.400 --> 41:43.580]  OK.
[41:44.580 --> 41:45.500]  Oh, almost.
[41:45.860 --> 41:46.800]  Oh, homies.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.740]  Wow, you homied them.
[41:52.060 --> 41:53.020]  That's awesome.
[41:53.360 --> 41:54.920]  I landed like I just did gymnastics.
[41:57.160 --> 41:58.000]  Oh, man.
[41:58.160 --> 41:58.600]  Come on, grab.
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.200]  Grab!
[42:00.020 --> 42:03.620]  I wonder if it's possible to fling yourself right to the top in one swing.
[42:04.900 --> 42:06.980]  If you get it real good in that.
[42:08.760 --> 42:14.300]  I don't know if you guys saw, but Gavin's lead is shrinking in the Olympics.
[42:14.700 --> 42:15.380]  I did see that.
[42:15.420 --> 42:15.740]  Is it?
[42:15.960 --> 42:16.080]  Yeah.
[42:16.100 --> 42:17.340]  You just took a bump.
[42:18.240 --> 42:19.040]  I'm in second.
[42:19.260 --> 42:19.480]  Start strong.
[42:19.900 --> 42:20.080]  Yeah.
[42:21.820 --> 42:24.220]  But the gap is getting a lot smaller.
[42:25.980 --> 42:27.940]  How much time is left in the Olympics, anyway?
[42:28.180 --> 42:30.760]  I think it's over in like four or five days.
[42:31.240 --> 42:31.460]  OK.
[42:31.640 --> 42:33.040]  Yeah, it's got to be like less than a week.
[42:34.660 --> 42:36.660]  I'm always surprised at how short it actually is.
[42:36.940 --> 42:37.460]  I know, same.
[42:37.620 --> 42:38.920]  It feels like it should be longer than it is.
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.400]  Infrastructure is built and how much cities get ruined for like a couple of weeks.
[42:44.400 --> 42:45.560]  You son of a gun.
[42:45.880 --> 42:46.380]  Look at you.
[42:51.500 --> 42:53.480]  This guy's called Pablo Wainick.
[42:56.080 --> 43:00.000]  Nice, good, doing good.
[43:00.120 --> 43:01.760]  Uh-oh, wrong one, wrong one, wrong one.
[43:01.900 --> 43:02.560]  Doing bad, doing bad.
[43:02.760 --> 43:03.440]  OK, doing good.
[43:03.640 --> 43:04.360]  Good.
[43:06.100 --> 43:06.660]  Yeah.
[43:10.680 --> 43:11.740]  There you go.
[43:15.370 --> 43:16.910]  Uh-oh, Nick.
[43:17.190 --> 43:17.550]  It's OK.
[43:23.100 --> 43:23.780]  Got it.
[43:23.820 --> 43:24.180]  Cliffhanger.
[43:24.660 --> 43:25.460]  Now, what now?
[43:25.580 --> 43:25.940]  Now jump.
[43:26.400 --> 43:27.300]  You got 20 something seconds.
[43:28.620 --> 43:30.680]  Are you, are you joking?
[43:31.440 --> 43:34.840]  Are you, are you fucking kidding?
[43:35.400 --> 43:36.780]  Gavin said jump, so I jumped.
[43:37.080 --> 43:38.640]  He was about to do something cool.
[43:38.700 --> 43:41.360]  And it's just like, I'm thinking about blowing it.
[43:41.620 --> 43:42.700]  Gavin said jump, so I jumped.
[43:42.720 --> 43:43.840]  He listened to me again.
[43:45.020 --> 43:46.520]  Oh, you got this, you got this, you got this.
[43:47.120 --> 43:47.480]  Yes.
[43:47.880 --> 43:50.440]  Oh no.
[43:50.600 --> 43:52.840]  Gavin said jump, you dunce.
[43:53.160 --> 43:58.240]  Hey, what, what, what about our experiences in Grand Theft Auto have told you that I wouldn't listen?
[43:58.580 --> 43:59.620]  Did you guys finish that yet?
[44:01.040 --> 44:02.420]  Uh, no, no.
[44:02.880 --> 44:04.160]  In fact, when are you out of town again?
[44:04.180 --> 44:05.280]  That's when I want to play Grand Theft Auto.
[44:05.460 --> 44:06.000]  Uh, next week.
[44:06.720 --> 44:07.180]  OK, cool.
[44:08.700 --> 44:10.700]  I think we have to finish the last.
[44:11.760 --> 44:12.480]  This is awesome, Gavin.
[44:13.360 --> 44:14.660]  Putting on a clinic.
[44:15.840 --> 44:18.520]  So we did all the setups for the second one.
[44:18.780 --> 44:19.860]  For the Humane Labs.
[44:20.040 --> 44:20.920]  We just need to do the finale.
[44:21.540 --> 44:24.600]  And then we have two of the other heists after that.
[44:24.660 --> 44:27.280]  Plus whatever the newer stuff they've added.
[44:28.040 --> 44:29.360]  Hit start, hit start, hit start.
[44:29.880 --> 44:32.060]  Oh Gavin, oh Gavin, oh Gavin.
[44:36.480 --> 44:37.700]  OK, all right, you got it.
[44:38.800 --> 44:40.520]  Oh man, here you go.
[44:40.600 --> 44:42.440]  Well, I didn't think I'd go that fast.
[44:43.240 --> 44:44.960]  All right, up in one, up in one.
[44:45.100 --> 44:45.540]  Here we go.
[44:45.760 --> 44:47.480]  Up in one, here you go, ready, and go.
[44:48.500 --> 44:49.860]  Nope, you got too many things around.
[44:50.460 --> 44:52.600]  Oh, it.
[45:05.120 --> 45:05.840]  OK, OK.
[45:07.880 --> 45:08.240]  OK.
[45:09.440 --> 45:10.640]  Stop tickling me.
[45:11.620 --> 45:12.860]  Oh, you gotta run the balls.
[45:13.560 --> 45:13.880]  Yep.
[45:15.920 --> 45:17.120]  There we go.
[45:17.480 --> 45:19.680]  A, X, boom, nice reach.
[45:20.880 --> 45:22.220]  All the way around.
[45:22.640 --> 45:23.140]  Got it.
[45:24.060 --> 45:24.400]  OK.
[45:26.380 --> 45:27.060]  Boom.
[45:27.240 --> 45:27.760]  Do a jump.
[45:28.940 --> 45:29.820]  Let it go, let it go.
[45:30.260 --> 45:32.440]  Oh, I did a little bit.
[45:34.320 --> 45:35.720]  Oh, look at that.
[45:36.180 --> 45:37.760]  Wow, that's phenomenal.
[45:38.120 --> 45:39.820]  I love that.
[45:40.360 --> 45:42.840]  So, dude, wow.
[45:43.180 --> 45:43.700]  Good.
[45:45.040 --> 45:47.120]  Oh, look, it's good for full extension.
[45:48.840 --> 45:50.380]  And he wants to get his balls cupped.
[45:54.420 --> 45:55.640]  All right, here we go.
[45:56.700 --> 45:57.360]  You got it, Nick.
[45:57.720 --> 45:58.920]  Just don't listen to Gavin.
[45:59.560 --> 46:00.780]  Never listen to me.
[46:02.860 --> 46:03.880]  OK, you got it.
[46:07.640 --> 46:08.040]  Let go.
[46:08.380 --> 46:08.960]  Here we go.
[46:09.080 --> 46:09.600]  Up we go.
[46:09.720 --> 46:10.140]  All right.
[46:10.520 --> 46:11.400]  And let's see.
[46:11.440 --> 46:11.800]  Got it.
[46:12.160 --> 46:12.460]  Let go.
[46:12.920 --> 46:16.280]  Let go there, there and there and there and let go.
[46:16.280 --> 46:16.760]  Yeah.
[46:17.260 --> 46:17.700]  Nice.
[46:18.240 --> 46:19.780]  OK, now B, Y.
[46:20.180 --> 46:20.360]  Yeah.
[46:22.020 --> 46:22.620]  Oh, B.
[46:23.140 --> 46:23.580]  Wow.
[46:25.520 --> 46:25.960]  Oh.
[46:26.360 --> 46:28.820]  Oh, you got it.
[46:28.860 --> 46:29.500]  You got it.
[46:29.920 --> 46:30.860]  Now do a jump.
[46:31.080 --> 46:31.200]  Yeah.
[46:31.380 --> 46:32.940]  All right, let's see.
[46:33.220 --> 46:33.440]  Ready?
[46:34.620 --> 46:35.220]  Oh, let go.
[46:35.600 --> 46:35.880]  Let go.
[46:35.980 --> 46:36.460]  Let go.
[46:37.440 --> 46:38.300]  All right, here we go.
[46:38.800 --> 46:39.740]  We're going to swing around.
[46:41.020 --> 46:41.840]  Here we go.
[46:42.900 --> 46:43.720]  Damn, eh.
[46:49.440 --> 46:50.420]  You are running out of time.
[46:50.700 --> 46:51.080]  I know.
[46:51.320 --> 46:52.040]  Don't listen to him.
[46:52.320 --> 46:52.660]  Got it.
[46:52.720 --> 46:52.960]  Hold on.
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.620]  I got plenty of time to get on.
[46:54.740 --> 46:55.060]  Oh, no.
[46:55.600 --> 46:56.040]  Fuck.
[46:56.040 --> 46:56.880]  He almost got eliminated.
[46:57.280 --> 46:59.440]  You dick whipped the cat at the last second.
[47:03.020 --> 47:07.590]  Oh, meow.
[47:14.720 --> 47:17.220]  Is this where Nick fucks cats lore starts?
[47:17.380 --> 47:18.200]  No, I'm out.
[47:19.100 --> 47:21.000]  You can go ahead and cut the last 10 seconds.
[47:21.000 --> 47:21.260]  Is that it?
[47:24.640 --> 47:26.340]  Nick's like, uh, I'll be editing this one.
[47:28.480 --> 47:31.340]  Nice little single screen gameplay with a lot cut out of it.
[47:31.520 --> 47:31.640]  Okay.
[47:33.320 --> 47:35.180]  Oh, what are you watching?
[47:35.280 --> 47:36.640]  I don't remember Nick winning every round.
[47:40.300 --> 47:41.720]  He got up there fast.
[47:42.220 --> 47:42.780]  He sure did.
[47:45.700 --> 47:46.780]  Oh, look at this.
[47:55.210 --> 47:56.150]  He's doing a little dance.
[47:56.150 --> 47:57.770]  This is the longest game I've ever seen.
[47:58.550 --> 48:00.150]  I bet we're only halfway through.
[48:01.090 --> 48:01.870]  You think so?
[48:02.110 --> 48:02.430]  Space.
[48:02.790 --> 48:05.050]  You're getting to the top with like 20 seconds left.
[48:06.070 --> 48:06.630]  Yeah, I'm good at this.
[48:06.890 --> 48:07.450]  Oh, Nick.
[48:07.550 --> 48:07.950]  No, you're not.
[48:08.010 --> 48:08.890]  So we're only about halfway.
[48:09.010 --> 48:09.470]  Here we go.
[48:09.550 --> 48:10.070]  Oh, Nick, Nick.
[48:10.150 --> 48:11.030]  You got it, Nick, you got it, you got it.
[48:11.650 --> 48:14.090]  Oh, what a miracle.
[48:14.570 --> 48:15.630]  Oh, yeah, it sure was.
[48:16.930 --> 48:18.770]  It felt pretty hopeless for a minute there, fellas.
[48:21.730 --> 48:23.330]  It was a space miracle.
[48:23.330 --> 48:23.690]  Oh, shit.
[48:24.010 --> 48:24.430]  Oh, shit.
[48:24.810 --> 48:25.590]  Oh, grab it.
[48:25.590 --> 48:26.310]  Oh, Nick.
[48:27.450 --> 48:29.010]  Be a Sandra Bullock.
[48:29.110 --> 48:30.370]  Don't be a George Clooney.
[48:33.570 --> 48:35.370]  Man, I did not like that movie.
[48:35.530 --> 48:35.910]  Space.
[48:36.070 --> 48:37.110]  Never saw it.
[48:37.350 --> 48:37.790]  Gravity.
[48:38.570 --> 48:41.090]  Like the bit where she almost died six times and then landed on Earth.
[48:41.270 --> 48:43.710]  She just kept almost dying.
[48:44.050 --> 48:45.170]  Me and my wife left that movie.
[48:45.210 --> 48:50.490]  Just went, wow, that was maybe too many times of her almost dying over and over again.
[48:50.810 --> 48:53.170]  It was the first movie I saw with Nick.
[48:53.750 --> 48:53.950]  Yeah.
[48:54.450 --> 48:54.710]  Really?
[48:54.710 --> 48:55.230]  Yeah.
[48:56.030 --> 48:56.310]  Really?
[48:56.850 --> 48:57.250]  Yeah.
[48:57.750 --> 48:58.790]  What year did that movie come out?
[48:59.970 --> 49:00.370]  Really.
[49:01.250 --> 49:01.650]  Yeah.
[49:01.790 --> 49:01.970]  Really?
[49:02.770 --> 49:02.970]  Yep.
[49:05.750 --> 49:07.470]  Wait, what year did that movie come out?
[49:09.870 --> 49:10.270]  2002?
[49:10.290 --> 49:10.790]  I'm going to guess...
[49:11.530 --> 49:11.930]  What?
[49:13.090 --> 49:13.490]  What?
[49:16.550 --> 49:18.990]  Oh, did that not sound right to you?
[49:19.270 --> 49:19.990]  Not at all.
[49:20.050 --> 49:20.690]  Not quite right.
[49:22.410 --> 49:23.230]  No, I think that's right.
[49:24.090 --> 49:24.570]  Uh...
[49:24.570 --> 49:27.110]  If you asked me when that movie came out, I would say five years ago.
[49:27.510 --> 49:27.970]  That's what I was thinking too.
[49:27.970 --> 49:29.090]  It must be way longer than that though.
[49:29.090 --> 49:31.270]  I would guess sometime around 11 years ago.
[49:32.010 --> 49:32.550]  Oh my God.
[49:33.910 --> 49:35.110]  Time's got to knock it off.
[49:35.850 --> 49:36.130]  Yeah.
[49:37.710 --> 49:38.730]  I don't like it, man.
[49:39.110 --> 49:43.050]  I'm pretty sure I remember that movie coming out way more recently than that.
[49:43.310 --> 49:44.170]  That's what I thought.
[49:49.940 --> 49:50.560]  Got him.
[49:51.160 --> 49:51.780]  Got him.
[49:52.080 --> 49:53.240]  Nick's feeling the stress now.
[49:53.600 --> 49:54.780]  Oh, but he's not mucking about.
[49:54.780 --> 49:55.660]  He's already on the stack.
[49:56.100 --> 49:56.960]  He's going right for it.
[49:58.100 --> 49:59.700]  He's not swinging around fucking off.
[49:59.780 --> 50:00.480]  He's got this thing.
[50:00.580 --> 50:01.500]  Nick is living it though.
[50:01.780 --> 50:03.800]  He's hit a groove with this game.
[50:04.020 --> 50:04.540]  That is...
[50:04.540 --> 50:05.080]  It's impressive.
[50:05.580 --> 50:05.940]  Thank you.
[50:06.240 --> 50:06.520]  Uh-oh.
[50:07.200 --> 50:07.620]  Uh-oh.
[50:07.660 --> 50:07.960]  Careful.
[50:08.200 --> 50:08.380]  Careful.
[50:08.880 --> 50:09.240]  Uh-oh.
[50:10.040 --> 50:11.000]  Geoff went right to my head.
[50:11.140 --> 50:11.360]  Okay.
[50:12.460 --> 50:13.560]  Nick's also easy to shake.
[50:13.900 --> 50:14.840]  Very easy to shake.
[50:15.500 --> 50:16.540]  Do you ever play a game and think,
[50:16.640 --> 50:18.300]  I never want to meet the person who made it?
[50:19.700 --> 50:20.100]  Yeah.
[50:20.660 --> 50:21.060]  Sometimes.
[50:25.320 --> 50:26.440]  Gears of War.
[50:27.300 --> 50:27.860]  Oh, no.
[50:28.020 --> 50:28.680]  Oh, no.
[50:30.020 --> 50:30.380]  Okay.
[50:31.440 --> 50:31.860]  We're all right.
[50:32.020 --> 50:32.260]  We're good.
[50:32.360 --> 50:32.980]  You still got time.
[50:33.400 --> 50:35.900]  Just don't do that one more time.
[50:37.440 --> 50:37.800]  Okay.
[50:38.360 --> 50:38.760]  All right.
[50:38.880 --> 50:39.180]  All right.
[50:39.220 --> 50:39.460]  Okay.
[50:39.980 --> 50:40.320]  Okay.
[50:40.320 --> 50:40.800]  All right.
[50:40.820 --> 50:41.340]  Get momentum.
[50:41.520 --> 50:42.000]  Get speed.
[50:42.320 --> 50:43.420]  Look at the momentum.
[50:44.180 --> 50:44.560]  Here we go.
[50:44.620 --> 50:45.680]  The movement here.
[50:47.080 --> 50:47.440]  Wow.
[50:50.260 --> 50:50.920]  I'm impressed.
[50:51.040 --> 50:51.760]  I don't want this to end.
[50:53.560 --> 50:54.520]  Apparently, they don't either.
[50:55.120 --> 50:56.460]  I'm just getting sweaty now.
[50:56.560 --> 50:57.160]  Come on.
[50:57.320 --> 50:58.180]  God, I thought he was going to say,
[50:58.220 --> 50:58.940]  I'm just getting started.
[51:02.720 --> 51:03.560]  I'm just getting started.
[51:05.720 --> 51:06.120]  Don't worry.
[51:06.160 --> 51:06.900]  He's going to edit himself.
[51:07.200 --> 51:07.320]  Yeah.
[51:07.380 --> 51:08.200]  See, I got it.
[51:08.940 --> 51:10.640]  We're going to help Nick sound so fucking cool.
[51:10.920 --> 51:11.720]  Dude, I'm going to sound great.
[51:11.840 --> 51:15.180]  You want to feed me some more one-liners when I reach the end?
[51:15.500 --> 51:17.980]  We should do a Let's Play one day where we go back and
[51:19.200 --> 51:21.840]  re-record every line to the point where we're all so cool.
[51:24.780 --> 51:28.280]  Dude, this fucking Let's Play is funny the whole way through.
[51:28.700 --> 51:31.500]  Like if a leather jacket was a Let's Play, it'd be this one.
[51:35.170 --> 51:35.650]  Grab.
[51:35.830 --> 51:36.150]  Here we go.
[51:36.210 --> 51:36.910]  No bad ideas.
[51:38.270 --> 51:38.750]  Go.
[51:40.170 --> 51:40.910]  I got this.
[51:41.490 --> 51:42.970]  Please don't put me on the right side, game.
[51:44.390 --> 51:44.670]  Okay.
[51:46.370 --> 51:46.630]  Okay.
[51:47.730 --> 51:48.470]  Oh, fall down.
[51:48.690 --> 51:49.130]  God damn.
[51:50.650 --> 51:51.630]  Hop in, baby.
[51:52.070 --> 51:52.390]  All right.
[51:52.890 --> 51:54.010]  Yawn, lobster camp.
[51:54.010 --> 51:54.850]  Whoop.
[51:55.650 --> 51:56.230]  Here we go.
[51:57.390 --> 51:58.710]  Oh, grab it, you fool.
[52:00.610 --> 52:01.550]  There we go.
[52:02.110 --> 52:03.110]  There we go.
[52:05.550 --> 52:06.910]  And why?
[52:08.390 --> 52:10.330]  We need to remember Andrew...
[52:10.330 --> 52:15.850]  I was talking to Andrew and came up with a really good idea for some supplemental content
[52:15.850 --> 52:22.450]  involving a movie that just came out that we should definitely do.
[52:23.170 --> 52:23.430]  Okay.
[52:24.190 --> 52:25.330]  We just have to...
[52:25.330 --> 52:26.750]  We gotta remember to bring it up to him later.
[52:27.070 --> 52:27.410]  It's...
[52:27.410 --> 52:27.910]  Man, it's great.
[52:28.650 --> 52:29.510]  I'm sure he'll remember.
[52:33.070 --> 52:34.330]  Damn, dude.
[52:34.330 --> 52:34.990]  Oh, Nick, all the way up.
[52:35.790 --> 52:36.290]  Oh, no.
[52:36.450 --> 52:36.770]  Nick!
[52:37.290 --> 52:37.690]  No!
[52:38.490 --> 52:39.310]  Nick, no!
[52:40.930 --> 52:42.630]  Nick, hold the button and go back.
[52:48.310 --> 52:50.590]  Hey, man, you gotta grab the goat by the horns, baby.
[52:50.850 --> 52:52.330]  Hey, guys, Eric wins again.
[52:52.450 --> 52:55.570]  Nick, you're up there with like 15 seconds left.
[52:55.810 --> 52:56.830]  That was awesome.
[52:56.830 --> 52:58.510]  That was insane.
[52:58.970 --> 53:01.810]  Well, guys, thanks so much for watching Mount Your Friends.
[53:02.090 --> 53:03.470]  This has been a lot of fun.
[53:03.610 --> 53:05.110]  I kind of want to see what the 3D one's all about.
[53:05.190 --> 53:06.090]  Maybe we'll do that later.
[53:07.370 --> 53:10.390]  Did we put this on YouTube or did we put it on Patreon?
[53:10.650 --> 53:16.450]  Only one way to find out is watch this video and then leave a comment that lets us know where it is.
[53:17.770 --> 53:20.410]  And if you ever want us to play it again,
[53:20.530 --> 53:24.650]  I just noticed there's different map configurations I can pick too.
[53:25.240 --> 53:26.930]  Oh, I thought you were picking different ones.
[53:26.990 --> 53:27.630]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[53:30.010 --> 53:32.670]  Well, if we put this on YouTube,
[53:33.250 --> 53:38.450]  then go check out our Patreon at patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[53:38.770 --> 53:45.330]  Or you can go to our YouTube channel, which is a regulation gameplay channel,
[53:45.410 --> 53:46.710]  if we put this on Patreon.
[53:46.870 --> 53:50.950]  So either way, but whatever you do, go check out the regulation podcast,
[53:50.950 --> 53:53.790]  which is really all of this in support of.
[53:53.790 --> 53:55.310]  Thank you for that.
[53:55.710 --> 53:58.450]  Any wise words or final thoughts for the folks at home, guys?
[53:59.250 --> 54:01.570]  If you're gonna mount your friends, be safe.
[54:02.470 --> 54:03.130]  Stuck the landing.
