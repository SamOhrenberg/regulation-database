[00:00.000 --> 00:02.340]  Uh, did Gavin not get an invite?
[00:03.320 --> 00:05.720]  I invited him. Send another one.
[00:07.080 --> 00:10.420]  It's down there at the bottom. He just didn't go to it. No, it's good. He's going.
[00:10.920 --> 00:11.680]  He just didn't.
[00:12.920 --> 00:17.620]  If I had to describe Gavin in 2025, it's defiant against things I don't get.
[00:20.740 --> 00:22.860]  You don't get it because you don't edit.
[00:24.020 --> 00:25.720]  No, but I'm saying generally speaking.
[00:26.300 --> 00:26.920]  Well, that rhymed.
[00:27.340 --> 00:32.020]  You take the waveform of the bleep bloop bloop on this dashboard
[00:32.020 --> 00:36.060]  and you align it with the waveform on the audio. You don't have to listen to it.
[00:36.520 --> 00:42.640]  But the amount of conversation we've had relating to this greatly outweighs 20 seconds.
[00:43.700 --> 00:44.600]  How long?
[00:44.780 --> 00:46.340]  20 seconds. I did the sync.
[00:47.920 --> 00:53.160]  But yeah, we've spent 30 minutes talking about a thing where if you would have just
[00:53.160 --> 00:58.400]  done the five second count, would have been 65 seconds at this point or whatever, 80.
[00:58.860 --> 00:59.980]  We'd be less than two minutes.
[01:02.220 --> 01:03.020]  Time is money.
[01:03.800 --> 01:06.620]  No, but that's my point. That's my point.
[01:06.800 --> 01:09.080]  You think that, but what you're doing is actually...
[01:09.880 --> 01:13.220]  Welcome to Trucks. We're back playing Trucks. It works now. Trucks is great.
[01:14.300 --> 01:15.820]  Gavin's still not in the game.
[01:15.920 --> 01:18.980]  I don't care. This game never works. It's always broken.
[01:19.200 --> 01:19.640]  He'll get here.
[01:20.560 --> 01:21.680]  Are you still syncing?
[01:22.280 --> 01:22.720]  No.
[01:23.500 --> 01:24.660]  Okay. Why are you in the game?
[01:25.220 --> 01:27.340]  What the hell is going on with Gavin's game?
[01:27.940 --> 01:32.440]  This podcast is an infuriating loop of callbacks that must be...
[01:32.780 --> 01:33.160]  Yeah.
[01:33.480 --> 01:39.700]  I would love to see somebody figure out how to canonically lay out all of the content
[01:39.700 --> 01:42.780]  based on when it was recorded. You know what I mean?
[01:43.020 --> 01:45.240]  So that you could listen to it. It wouldn't be in numbered order,
[01:45.300 --> 01:47.300]  but you could listen to it in order of grievance.
[01:47.300 --> 01:48.300]  Gavin's here.
[01:48.880 --> 01:50.800]  Wow. Listening to it in order...
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.880]  Listening to this podcast in order of grievance is like a totally different way of consuming it.
[01:55.160 --> 01:55.660]  That's crazy.
[01:56.420 --> 02:00.400]  The loop is we waste time, which causes a waste of money,
[02:00.520 --> 02:03.880]  and then we reconvert that into content, which makes our money back.
[02:04.980 --> 02:05.360]  He's...
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.620]  He's saying this as he's the only one not in the game still.
[02:10.440 --> 02:11.620]  I don't know what you want from me.
[02:13.240 --> 02:16.200]  Andrew, I need something from you real fast, if you wouldn't mind.
[02:16.200 --> 02:21.120]  I need a mission that we're gonna do so that I can figure out what trucks to give the other two.
[02:21.380 --> 02:22.000]  Okay, perfect.
[02:22.100 --> 02:23.260]  Thank you, by the way.
[02:23.560 --> 02:24.180]  Not a drill.
[02:25.900 --> 02:27.520]  Okay, that's gonna be under Dyson Diesel.
[02:28.120 --> 02:30.440]  Excuse the mess, we're still cleaning up after the flood.
[02:30.600 --> 02:32.600]  Oh my god, I did this six years ago.
[02:32.680 --> 02:35.400]  Okay, deliver metal beams to the drilling site.
[02:35.480 --> 02:36.480]  We're gonna need two metal beams.
[02:36.600 --> 02:38.380]  We're gonna need an oil rig drill.
[02:38.540 --> 02:39.740]  Oh Christ, where is that?
[02:39.740 --> 02:40.200]  I'm tracking.
[02:41.160 --> 02:43.060]  Oh, that's in Smithville Dam.
[02:43.700 --> 02:45.140]  We're ghost cars, Gavin.
[02:47.180 --> 02:49.000]  Oh, that's actually cool.
[02:49.160 --> 02:49.500]  Get real.
[02:49.900 --> 02:50.760]  Get real.
[02:50.880 --> 02:51.280]  Get real.
[02:52.700 --> 02:54.640]  Real spooky, we're ghosts.
[02:55.060 --> 02:57.880]  All right, Nick, I'm gonna let you get metal beams.
[02:58.240 --> 02:59.240]  Okay, is that the warehouse?
[02:59.620 --> 03:02.460]  That's in the town storage is one place you can get them.
[03:03.380 --> 03:05.720]  So it's the big downtown area.
[03:07.880 --> 03:09.760]  You trying to parkour out of here?
[03:10.420 --> 03:13.300]  There might be metal beams over here at the sideboard trailer.
[03:13.420 --> 03:14.180]  It looks like there are.
[03:14.500 --> 03:14.900]  Oh yeah.
[03:15.600 --> 03:16.920]  So where am I going?
[03:17.460 --> 03:19.500]  I mean, you're kind of, you're hung up here.
[03:19.680 --> 03:20.720]  Maybe I'll go get those.
[03:20.920 --> 03:21.400]  Why is that?
[03:21.960 --> 03:22.800]  Okay, I don't know.
[03:22.860 --> 03:23.640]  That's why I'm asking.
[03:23.880 --> 03:25.000]  Why is that?
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.680]  Warehouse service parts.
[03:27.740 --> 03:29.140]  Let me see if the warehouse service parts.
[03:29.640 --> 03:31.700]  I'm liking this ghost truck thing we got going.
[03:31.780 --> 03:33.000]  I feel like you're trying to avoid me.
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.100]  Well, on Gavin's screen, they're not ghost trucks.
[03:38.260 --> 03:38.380]  They're real trucks.
[03:38.380 --> 03:40.420]  On my screen, we are ghost trucks still.
[03:40.520 --> 03:41.680]  Oh, I see, you're blue.
[03:41.800 --> 03:43.920]  On my screen, we've become real.
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.200]  You've ran me into a crate.
[03:45.360 --> 03:45.840]  Yes.
[03:46.740 --> 03:48.360]  It looks interesting on the mini-map.
[03:48.540 --> 03:49.320]  Does it?
[03:49.700 --> 03:52.080]  I gotta maintain, I gotta maintain my Grimer truck.
[03:52.940 --> 03:54.020]  You're breaking my truck.
[03:54.020 --> 03:54.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:54.860 --> 03:55.580]  You're breaking it, Andrew.
[03:55.760 --> 03:57.500]  Oh my God.
[04:01.700 --> 04:03.900]  Andrew is still showing ghost trucks.
[04:04.100 --> 04:05.000]  They are not ghost trucks.
[04:05.120 --> 04:05.960]  This is real trucks.
[04:06.200 --> 04:08.680]  And Gavin's truck is messed up and upside down.
[04:09.140 --> 04:13.600]  Wow, it simulates the, it simulates the truck position on the mini-map.
[04:14.520 --> 04:16.520]  He was flipped upside down on the mini-map.
[04:16.780 --> 04:17.480]  Yeah, and in real life.
[04:18.120 --> 04:20.720]  Well, yeah, I'm just saying it's impressive.
[04:21.200 --> 04:21.280]  Nick?
[04:21.700 --> 04:22.000]  Yes?
[04:22.100 --> 04:23.660]  I'm giving you a truck.
[04:24.000 --> 04:24.600]  Thank you.
[04:24.980 --> 04:25.880]  And a trailer.
[04:26.460 --> 04:26.740]  Excellent.
[04:27.260 --> 04:30.620]  Let me get, but this truck should do you good, all right?
[04:30.640 --> 04:31.660]  It should not be a problem.
[04:32.080 --> 04:32.440]  I do good.
[04:32.460 --> 04:33.320]  I'm gonna put it over here.
[04:33.760 --> 04:34.880]  Okay, now if you'll look at the map.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.600]  What have you done?
[04:36.020 --> 04:36.820]  Okay, I'm looking at it.
[04:36.920 --> 04:38.240]  You gotta switch trucks, bud.
[04:38.440 --> 04:40.080]  If you, if you come out of the trailer.
[04:40.300 --> 04:40.940]  Little truck smooch.
[04:41.860 --> 04:43.340]  If you come out of the, after you kiss.
[04:43.340 --> 04:45.880]  If you come out of the garage and you take a right.
[04:45.960 --> 04:48.760]  And then go right, follow it all the way around.
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.700]  You'll see in the back.
[04:49.920 --> 04:52.880]  There's a place called the warehouse with service spare parts.
[04:53.420 --> 04:54.000]  Yeah, I see it over there.
[04:54.140 --> 04:55.100]  In there, you can get two.
[04:55.180 --> 04:56.340]  You can get the metal beams we need.
[04:56.420 --> 04:56.800]  Okay, all right.
[04:56.820 --> 04:58.340]  I'm gonna make, mark it as a destination.
[04:58.820 --> 05:01.900]  So I'm gonna go ahead and hop out of this vehicle.
[05:02.140 --> 05:03.920]  We want to change any video settings or something?
[05:04.480 --> 05:06.160]  Is that a thing we do when it always resets?
[05:06.560 --> 05:07.360]  Oh, we don't.
[05:07.520 --> 05:08.500]  Let's just go with what we have.
[05:08.560 --> 05:08.860]  It's fine.
[05:09.160 --> 05:11.360]  Well, everybody should be.
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.320]  The reason we changed all those settings in the past was just to eliminate getting dropped.
[05:19.140 --> 05:20.640]  Oh, oh, oh, yes.
[05:20.700 --> 05:21.880]  I don't think that's a problem.
[05:22.140 --> 05:25.880]  Yeah, so the reason that we're back on trucks is Geoff has been back on trucks
[05:25.880 --> 05:27.520]  and says that it has not been crashing.
[05:28.040 --> 05:29.800]  Yeah, it's been fingers crossed.
[05:29.900 --> 05:30.380]  It's been working.
[05:30.700 --> 05:32.620]  So, you know, we'll see.
[05:32.740 --> 05:33.480]  I remember how to play.
[05:33.880 --> 05:34.660]  We'll fucking see.
[05:34.800 --> 05:35.840]  Oh, nice trailer, Nick.
[05:36.260 --> 05:36.700]  Oh, thanks.
[05:36.800 --> 05:37.760]  Geoff got it for me.
[05:39.100 --> 05:40.880]  Are we all working on the same thing today?
[05:40.880 --> 05:41.720]  I think so.
[05:41.780 --> 05:42.860]  We're going to that not a drill.
[05:42.960 --> 05:44.840]  I'm here to help whoever needs it.
[05:45.360 --> 05:46.120]  Oh, Christ.
[05:46.440 --> 05:47.040]  Forgot about turning.
[05:47.560 --> 05:48.040]  All right.
[05:48.980 --> 05:51.260]  Now I need to figure out what I'm going to do.
[05:51.520 --> 05:52.220]  Not a drill.
[05:52.300 --> 05:52.740]  Where's that?
[05:53.060 --> 05:53.780]  Is that this mark?
[05:54.380 --> 05:55.880]  It's under contracts.
[05:56.040 --> 05:57.640]  Dyson Diesel is the first contract.
[05:57.740 --> 05:59.160]  Not a drill, right?
[05:59.720 --> 06:01.320]  Yeah, I see it.
[06:01.740 --> 06:02.700]  Start tracking.
[06:03.900 --> 06:07.680]  So Nick is going to be delivering those metal beams.
[06:07.680 --> 06:11.380]  When that gets completed, it's going to unlock the next.
[06:12.740 --> 06:15.840]  Uh, I'm going to try to catch up the neck portion of the mission,
[06:15.900 --> 06:19.460]  which is to get the oil rig drill, which is in Smithville.
[06:19.580 --> 06:23.700]  They would drive by construction rigs in my trailer.
[06:25.340 --> 06:27.300]  Need to get that to the drilling site.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.240]  Why don't I go get that?
[06:29.140 --> 06:30.680]  All right, I'll go.
[06:31.480 --> 06:32.400]  All right, what shall I do?
[06:33.000 --> 06:34.440]  I'm going to pull out a truck for you.
[06:34.940 --> 06:37.460]  And then I'll tell you what you should do.
[06:37.460 --> 06:37.900]  Okay.
[06:40.180 --> 06:41.440]  Go fuck yourself.
[06:41.840 --> 06:49.360]  I was braced just in case.
[06:50.120 --> 06:56.000]  You should deliver two rounds of bricks to Smithville Dam.
[06:56.740 --> 07:01.040]  You should go to the exact same place that Nick is going to.
[07:01.240 --> 07:03.040]  And you can go in my truck right now.
[07:03.160 --> 07:03.900]  Let me pop out.
[07:04.820 --> 07:05.500]  And, uh...
[07:05.500 --> 07:06.300]  Popping out truck.
[07:06.300 --> 07:08.800]  You guys are so fucking lucky to have access to these trucks.
[07:08.960 --> 07:09.160]  This is my favorite truck right now.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.000]  Yeah, thanks, by the way.
[07:10.340 --> 07:11.260]  I'm giving to Gavin.
[07:11.420 --> 07:13.300]  Okay, so you follow Nick.
[07:13.380 --> 07:14.000]  You get bricks.
[07:14.100 --> 07:15.200]  Nick, you get steel beams.
[07:15.460 --> 07:16.180]  Off to beams.
[07:16.240 --> 07:17.160]  I'm helping Nick.
[07:17.700 --> 07:18.500]  Thanks, Andrew.
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.060]  Whatever you need, I'm here.
[07:20.220 --> 07:22.340]  All you get stuck in the mud, I got to pull.
[07:22.780 --> 07:23.160]  I'll try to...
[07:23.920 --> 07:25.540]  Our first adventure on this road.
[07:25.740 --> 07:26.740]  I sure do.
[07:27.980 --> 07:29.640]  Boy, that was bad.
[07:30.060 --> 07:31.460]  We've come a long way, thanks to Geoff.
[07:31.760 --> 07:32.380]  We have.
[07:34.380 --> 07:35.000]  Oh, you're just...
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.180]  You're trucking up this.
[07:36.300 --> 07:37.440]  This is a great job.
[07:37.560 --> 07:38.180]  You're doing really good.
[07:38.260 --> 07:39.380]  Way better than a pickup.
[07:39.700 --> 07:40.900]  I love the map in this game.
[07:40.960 --> 07:41.360]  It's so...
[07:42.540 --> 07:42.940]  Peaceful.
[07:43.900 --> 07:44.780]  It is.
[07:44.880 --> 07:45.760]  It's very cool to see.
[07:46.360 --> 07:49.400]  We are in Wisconsin over in, you know, with me and the truck boys.
[07:49.640 --> 07:49.820]  Yeah.
[07:50.260 --> 07:52.500]  And it is the coolest fucking map.
[07:52.560 --> 07:52.960]  I can't...
[07:52.960 --> 07:57.020]  I don't imagine we'll ever make it there here, but at the pace we're going.
[07:58.040 --> 07:58.920]  But, uh...
[07:58.920 --> 07:59.380]  Going through.
[07:59.660 --> 08:05.460]  If you ever find yourself in the Wisconsin map in this game, you'll absolutely love it.
[08:05.460 --> 08:06.420]  This is Michigan?
[08:06.800 --> 08:07.620]  This is Michigan.
[08:07.680 --> 08:08.380]  Yeah, this is Michigan.
[08:08.620 --> 08:12.720]  When you say map, Gavin, do you mean the literal UI of the map?
[08:13.260 --> 08:13.620]  Or...
[08:13.620 --> 08:14.960]  Yeah, like watching you and Nick drive around.
[08:15.160 --> 08:17.700]  Yeah, like the actual map itself in this game is so cool.
[08:17.700 --> 08:18.840]  It's a good actual map, too.
[08:18.860 --> 08:19.440]  It's really great.
[08:19.620 --> 08:20.700]  Am I getting in this Kenworth?
[08:21.400 --> 08:21.600]  Yeah.
[08:22.080 --> 08:22.720]  Oh, there's Andrew.
[08:23.600 --> 08:24.180]  I'm sneaking on by.
[08:24.180 --> 08:25.260]  I'm a little lighter than you.
[08:25.340 --> 08:25.920]  I'm sneaking on by.
[08:26.000 --> 08:26.520]  Don't mind me.
[08:26.580 --> 08:27.460]  I'm just cutting to the front.
[08:27.460 --> 08:28.520]  Oh my god, Andrew.
[08:28.860 --> 08:29.660]  I'm cutting to the front.
[08:29.660 --> 08:30.320]  Don't mind me.
[08:30.340 --> 08:31.060]  I'm doing a little...
[08:31.060 --> 08:32.140]  I'm cutting to the front.
[08:32.140 --> 08:35.700]  If you need to hitch on to something, you can hitch on to me.
[08:35.880 --> 08:37.680]  All right, well, so far, so good.
[08:38.340 --> 08:39.320]  I appreciate it.
[08:40.600 --> 08:41.380]  I appreciate it very much.
[08:41.380 --> 08:42.820]  This is where we got stuck last time, I think.
[08:42.860 --> 08:43.620]  Was right here.
[08:44.540 --> 08:46.080]  Passing gas back and forth.
[08:47.540 --> 08:48.700]  Just cheek to cheek.
[08:48.720 --> 08:50.120]  Is that just like farting on each other?
[08:50.420 --> 08:51.880]  Yeah, we're just farting back and forth.
[08:52.380 --> 08:54.520]  Probably would have been just as efficient, too.
[08:54.580 --> 08:55.420]  So am I following...
[08:55.420 --> 08:56.520]  Am I following those two?
[08:56.980 --> 08:57.640]  You follow Nick.
[08:57.720 --> 08:58.760]  I don't know what the fuck Andrew's doing.
[08:59.140 --> 09:00.120]  I'm leading Nick.
[09:00.140 --> 09:01.160]  I've been very clear.
[09:01.720 --> 09:02.080]  Yes.
[09:02.080 --> 09:03.500]  Well, he was following Nick.
[09:03.700 --> 09:06.040]  Right, he was following Nick for a very long time.
[09:06.260 --> 09:06.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:06.760 --> 09:08.000]  Oh, now I'm sleeping on the road.
[09:08.080 --> 09:08.700]  Look at me.
[09:08.820 --> 09:09.880]  Oh, I'm just having a little nap.
[09:10.100 --> 09:11.200]  All right, you lead the way.
[09:11.240 --> 09:11.840]  I'm back in auto.
[09:14.760 --> 09:15.760]  I wasn't sleeping.
[09:18.000 --> 09:18.560]  Fully alert.
[09:18.700 --> 09:20.380]  Oh yeah, you're fully alert.
[09:20.660 --> 09:23.260]  You didn't see these giant lights in the back of your truck.
[09:26.400 --> 09:27.760]  Eat sunflower seeds, Andrew.
[09:27.960 --> 09:30.140]  Supposedly, it's impossible to fall asleep while eating sunflower seeds.
[09:30.140 --> 09:31.000]  Really?
[09:31.500 --> 09:32.120]  That's what they say.
[09:32.840 --> 09:34.380]  I would do that a lot.
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.180]  Sunflower seeds help.
[09:37.140 --> 09:39.500]  Oh, that's a good road trip hack.
[09:39.900 --> 09:44.760]  You could also get like a tin of...
[09:44.760 --> 09:47.920]  for that was like for like Altoids and then soak a sponge in amphetamines
[09:47.920 --> 09:50.540]  and then put your like toothpicks in it.
[09:52.300 --> 09:53.180]  Oh, that's...
[09:53.180 --> 09:54.840]  I mean, you could do that or you could do sunflower seeds.
[09:54.960 --> 09:55.660]  It's up to you.
[09:56.040 --> 09:57.360]  What if you snorted a no-dose?
[09:57.600 --> 09:58.900]  That's... you could also do that.
[09:59.720 --> 10:01.800]  Eric, do our field of views all look the same?
[10:03.900 --> 10:08.360]  Andrew's looks close like Gavin's and everyone's is...
[10:08.720 --> 10:10.380]  yours is furthest, I think.
[10:10.700 --> 10:13.200]  Okay, I zoomed out that far sometimes.
[10:13.840 --> 10:17.280]  That's what I meant when I asked if we should change it because I feel like it reset.
[10:17.840 --> 10:19.320]  Yeah, but I... yeah, but I heard it's fine.
[10:20.480 --> 10:22.980]  It usually resets every time you restart the game
[10:22.980 --> 10:24.600]  and you have to go in and manually change it.
[10:24.680 --> 10:26.500]  So if mine is different, I don't know why it's...
[10:27.200 --> 10:30.760]  You're just... maybe it's just where you're at in the camera that you're on or whatever,
[10:30.880 --> 10:32.800]  but you just seem further away then.
[10:32.940 --> 10:34.740]  I have the fucking wrong truck.
[10:35.100 --> 10:37.900]  No, but you're supposed to be the guy who knows which truck to have.
[10:37.980 --> 10:39.560]  I am, that's why I'm getting rid of this truck.
[10:40.260 --> 10:42.220]  So, cargo management.
[10:42.380 --> 10:43.600]  Nick is loading up.
[10:44.540 --> 10:46.120]  Gavin, you okay? You in those back roads?
[10:47.140 --> 10:48.020]  Yeah, I'm on the way.
[10:48.500 --> 10:49.860]  I'm taking some dirt mounds.
[10:51.120 --> 10:52.000]  That's all we got.
[10:53.060 --> 10:54.860]  How do I do it into the other thing?
[10:55.540 --> 10:56.200]  Oh, there we go.
[10:57.060 --> 10:58.700]  And we need two sets of these, Geoff.
[10:58.800 --> 11:00.020]  We need two metal beams.
[11:00.160 --> 11:01.140]  Yep, there you go.
[11:01.600 --> 11:02.660]  That's why I gave you the trailer.
[11:03.100 --> 11:04.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know what?
[11:04.120 --> 11:04.520]  Checks out.
[11:04.960 --> 11:07.220]  Make sure you secure the cargo as well.
[11:07.980 --> 11:08.340]  Oh.
[11:10.080 --> 11:12.820]  That's up on the D-pad and then should be in the cargo tab.
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.380]  It might default for you.
[11:14.620 --> 11:15.400]  It defaults.
[11:15.620 --> 11:15.740]  Okay.
[11:15.820 --> 11:16.620]  Oh yeah, it sure did.
[11:16.840 --> 11:16.960]  Okay.
[11:18.040 --> 11:18.920]  I can help you up, Nick.
[11:19.020 --> 11:19.120]  Here.
[11:20.060 --> 11:21.160]  Oh, there's Gavin.
[11:21.600 --> 11:22.160]  Hey, what's up?
[11:22.260 --> 11:22.940]  Let's help him.
[11:23.060 --> 11:24.600]  You hit the back, I hit the side.
[11:24.940 --> 11:25.740]  Shall I get some backup?
[11:26.060 --> 11:28.200]  Oh, no touchy, no touchy, no touchy.
[11:29.160 --> 11:31.480]  Oh, I got bricks.
[11:31.600 --> 11:32.060]  Is that wrong?
[11:32.380 --> 11:32.540]  Shit.
[11:33.120 --> 11:33.640]  No, you need to get bricks.
[11:33.640 --> 11:34.380]  No, you're supposed to get bricks.
[11:34.440 --> 11:35.000]  Yeah, good job.
[11:35.060 --> 11:35.600]  You got them bricks.
[11:35.700 --> 11:36.260]  Geoff said bricks.
[11:36.320 --> 11:36.520]  Get bricks.
[11:36.660 --> 11:38.420]  Yeah, you're doing something different than they are.
[11:38.660 --> 11:39.760]  Time to get bricked up, dude.
[11:39.940 --> 11:40.300]  Let's go.
[11:40.440 --> 11:42.120]  All right, Gavin, now that you have bricks.
[11:42.460 --> 11:42.860]  Yes, son.
[11:42.900 --> 11:46.640]  Hit back, go right bumper over to contracts.
[11:47.400 --> 11:48.760]  Go to Husky forwarding.
[11:49.480 --> 11:52.500]  No, yeah, the essentials.
[11:53.520 --> 11:54.260]  All right, Andrew, you want to lead?
[11:54.260 --> 11:56.620]  Deliver the bricks to Smithfield Dam.
[11:56.860 --> 11:57.860]  Holy shit.
[11:57.980 --> 11:58.500]  That's far.
[11:58.740 --> 12:00.600]  So you go ahead and start heading that way.
[12:00.740 --> 12:00.960]  There you go.
[12:01.160 --> 12:01.720]  Oh, my God.
[12:01.720 --> 12:02.060]  That's where we got to go.
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.100]  That's our next stop, baby.
[12:03.280 --> 12:04.320]  It's the job, man.
[12:04.800 --> 12:05.520]  Oh, where are we going next?
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.100]  Uh, the drilling site.
[12:08.560 --> 12:11.080]  I'm going to have to stop by the family and say goodbye to them for a bit.
[12:13.320 --> 12:15.480]  Let me put some markers down on my map.
[12:16.060 --> 12:16.580]  All right.
[12:17.140 --> 12:19.460]  That's why I always tell Emily when I hit trucks,
[12:19.480 --> 12:21.660]  I don't know when I'm coming back, baby, but I will come back.
[12:24.640 --> 12:27.900]  Last night, it was about eleven forty five because I had to stop playing
[12:27.900 --> 12:30.500]  trucks last night to get a good night's sleep so I could play trucks with y'all.
[12:32.180 --> 12:33.540]  Thank you for thinking of us.
[12:33.640 --> 12:34.180]  I appreciate it.
[12:34.280 --> 12:35.660]  I will find you.
[12:36.120 --> 12:36.640]  All right.
[12:37.260 --> 12:39.140]  Well, my other friends were not happy, so...
[12:39.140 --> 12:39.700]  Uh oh.
[12:39.880 --> 12:40.760]  Uh oh.
[12:43.200 --> 12:45.060]  Boy, kicking up some dust there.
[12:45.520 --> 12:46.920]  I think I got enough fuel for this.
[12:47.740 --> 12:48.720]  Oh, dusty.
[12:49.300 --> 12:50.520]  Looks like Austin last week.
[12:50.680 --> 12:51.200]  Am I going the right way?
[12:52.180 --> 12:52.500]  Hmm.
[12:53.740 --> 12:58.080]  It worries me when Geoff asked those questions.
[12:58.180 --> 12:59.460]  Everyone else I expect it from.
[12:59.620 --> 13:02.620]  But when Geoff's like, I think I have the wrong truck or am I going the right way?
[13:02.640 --> 13:05.960]  I'm like, oh man, I feel like you're the only guy that I would trust in the situation that we're in.
[13:06.100 --> 13:06.880]  That makes me nervous.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.500]  I'm catching myself before I make a mistake.
[13:09.120 --> 13:12.380]  When you've played this game for, I don't know, a couple of thousand hours,
[13:12.540 --> 13:14.280]  you run on autopilot mostly.
[13:15.220 --> 13:17.700]  You check back in with yourself and be like, what am I doing?
[13:17.820 --> 13:18.140]  Oh, yeah.
[13:18.140 --> 13:24.160]  I think the most I ever learned about driving a giant truck is when I
[13:25.520 --> 13:27.460]  smashed a U-Haul into my wife's car.
[13:29.440 --> 13:30.220]  When was that?
[13:30.420 --> 13:32.920]  And what did you learn not to smash a U-Haul into your wife's car?
[13:33.280 --> 13:36.460]  When we, in 2015, oh, we weren't married yet.
[13:37.900 --> 13:39.880]  We had just moved in to our house.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.480]  Literally, I just, you know, unloaded everything from the truck.
[13:43.000 --> 13:43.400]  Insane.
[13:43.560 --> 13:45.000]  And I pulled out in a truck.
[13:45.060 --> 13:45.840]  I'm not used to driving.
[13:46.020 --> 13:46.940]  It's a long one.
[13:47.380 --> 13:49.780]  And I was like, I don't need to give it a wide berth.
[13:49.840 --> 13:51.340]  And I scraped the front of her Mini Cooper.
[13:52.740 --> 13:53.840]  Still married you, though.
[13:55.580 --> 13:56.760]  Uh, yeah, later.
[14:01.340 --> 14:02.180]  Yeah, eventually.
[14:02.540 --> 14:04.200]  Yeah, yeah, eventually I convinced her again.
[14:04.460 --> 14:05.700]  Do you think she lost respect?
[14:06.660 --> 14:08.200]  Um, yeah.
[14:08.380 --> 14:09.040]  Or maybe gained respect.
[14:09.740 --> 14:11.920]  I'm assuming my dad lost respect.
[14:12.060 --> 14:12.920]  He was in the truck with me.
[14:13.080 --> 14:15.040]  Oh, that's the worst.
[14:15.600 --> 14:16.440]  That's brutal.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.320]  Yeah, in front of a dad.
[14:20.320 --> 14:23.900]  But maybe Nick's dad loves rubbing against other cars.
[14:24.020 --> 14:25.180]  Maybe it was a bonding experience.
[14:25.940 --> 14:27.380]  Maybe he's a serial rubber.
[14:28.080 --> 14:31.560]  No, based on the non-conversation in the truck the rest of the way, I'd say no.
[14:31.900 --> 14:33.120]  But that's just dad.
[14:33.800 --> 14:36.540]  Have you ever noticed your dad serially rubbing in the past?
[14:37.140 --> 14:37.340]  No.
[14:38.460 --> 14:39.480]  I would hope he didn't.
[14:39.640 --> 14:40.240]  I don't think so.
[14:41.060 --> 14:45.420]  I mean, yeah, now that you've pointed it out, maybe I'll start, you know, kind of like when
[14:45.420 --> 14:47.000]  somebody says, have you seen that commercial with this?
[14:47.080 --> 14:48.180]  And you see it all the time after that.
[14:48.300 --> 14:50.020]  Maybe I'll just see him doing that from now on.
[14:50.120 --> 14:50.740]  What do they call that?
[14:50.800 --> 14:52.220]  Is that called the Dunning-Kruger effect?
[14:52.520 --> 14:53.100]  I think so.
[14:54.340 --> 14:55.420]  Two questions for you, Nick.
[14:55.520 --> 14:58.300]  One, does your dad have a pineapple tattoo?
[14:58.700 --> 15:01.720]  Two, does your dad know equal or more than Geoff?
[15:03.320 --> 15:03.620]  Uh-oh.
[15:06.120 --> 15:07.380]  No to the first one.
[15:07.700 --> 15:09.820]  It's okay to say yes to the second.
[15:09.920 --> 15:10.620]  Yes to the second.
[15:10.660 --> 15:11.660]  He's an Eden and Adonis.
[15:11.780 --> 15:12.780]  He is older.
[15:13.480 --> 15:14.220]  More life experience.
[15:14.360 --> 15:15.040]  Wiser by years.
[15:15.680 --> 15:20.820]  I bet you the working on Free Willy thing would play really well in the Swinger community.
[15:21.300 --> 15:22.180]  That's a great icebreaker.
[15:22.840 --> 15:23.340]  That's a...
[15:23.340 --> 15:24.840]  I worked on Willy.
[15:25.120 --> 15:25.280]  What?
[15:27.040 --> 15:29.340]  Willy was never the same after I got involved.
[15:31.580 --> 15:32.760]  I love this truck.
[15:33.980 --> 15:35.060]  Yeah, you love that truck?
[15:35.360 --> 15:35.820]  Yeah, I just...
[15:35.820 --> 15:37.340]  I drove straight through a bit.
[15:37.360 --> 15:39.300]  Gavin just tapped into his five-year-old self.
[15:39.540 --> 15:40.240]  Yeah, no kidding.
[15:40.240 --> 15:42.320]  I'm not kidding, I was a kid.
[15:42.940 --> 15:45.700]  Gavin, you have no idea how hard it was to give you that truck.
[15:45.780 --> 15:46.680]  That's my brand new truck.
[15:46.760 --> 15:48.240]  I've been driving over with the boys.
[15:48.460 --> 15:49.020]  It's phenomenal.
[15:49.560 --> 15:50.740]  It is the best.
[15:50.840 --> 15:52.700]  It's almost like a five-dollar DLC pack.
[15:52.840 --> 15:53.960]  And I bought it on a whim.
[15:54.340 --> 15:55.980]  It is the best purchase I've ever made.
[15:56.180 --> 15:58.920]  I want to own that Kenmore truck in real life now.
[15:59.300 --> 16:03.840]  I went through a section just then in about four seconds that would have taken me an hour and a half.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.180]  And the truck I started with.
[16:05.260 --> 16:06.400]  It's such a waste, dude.
[16:08.360 --> 16:09.640]  Dog shit gas mileage, though.
[16:10.660 --> 16:11.360]  Oh, yeah.
[16:14.440 --> 16:16.980]  Every freaking fork in the road, I guess the wrong way.
[16:17.080 --> 16:17.600]  What an idiot.
[16:18.520 --> 16:20.000]  When you get your fork, take it.
[16:22.940 --> 16:24.500]  Do you have a custom fork, Nick?
[16:26.000 --> 16:26.400]  What?
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.060]  Nick is sideways.
[16:29.740 --> 16:30.500]  Oh, no, I got you.
[16:30.900 --> 16:31.880]  All right, come get me.
[16:32.080 --> 16:33.180]  Why did you say no?
[16:33.480 --> 16:34.360]  Did you say no?
[16:34.780 --> 16:36.120]  I thought maybe I could wiggle.
[16:36.860 --> 16:37.680]  Nick is sideways.
[16:37.680 --> 16:41.820]  No, I think you can empirically have a look at Nick and know that he's sideways.
[16:42.260 --> 16:43.600]  Why would you come to this side?
[16:43.800 --> 16:44.300]  Oh, you're going to win.
[16:44.520 --> 16:45.380]  Oh, I'm winching.
[16:45.540 --> 16:46.140]  Got it.
[16:46.520 --> 16:47.160]  Uh, no, Gavin.
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.420]  I don't have a special guy on the side of his truck is questioning what I'm doing with mine.
[16:51.520 --> 16:53.940]  You know, um, you got me there.
[16:56.400 --> 16:57.520]  Where's my winch?
[17:00.940 --> 17:02.000]  I detached it.
[17:02.040 --> 17:02.940]  Sorry, that's my bad.
[17:02.960 --> 17:03.340]  That's okay.
[17:05.280 --> 17:06.980]  Being selective with my winch here.
[17:06.980 --> 17:09.120]  Let's get your front there.
[17:12.100 --> 17:14.040]  Oh, you might be too heavy for me, Nick.
[17:15.860 --> 17:16.940]  Can you hold Y?
[17:17.480 --> 17:18.120]  Can we double?
[17:18.740 --> 17:18.840]  Y.
[17:19.100 --> 17:21.360]  No, it says show double or damage.
[17:21.800 --> 17:22.420]  Show double?
[17:22.540 --> 17:25.020]  Nick, you said that like you were looking for it on the controller.
[17:25.680 --> 17:27.100]  Y, I know it's here somewhere.
[17:27.360 --> 17:27.780]  Yeah, I know.
[17:27.880 --> 17:28.280]  Hold on.
[17:28.360 --> 17:29.260]  Let's see.
[17:30.100 --> 17:31.220]  I think X.
[17:31.760 --> 17:33.400]  I might need to detach that trailer.
[17:33.940 --> 17:35.160]  Can you ram me, maybe?
[17:35.160 --> 17:36.520]  I think...
[17:37.480 --> 17:38.560]  I'll detach the trailer.
[17:38.680 --> 17:39.040]  I'm detached.
[17:39.380 --> 17:41.160]  You're attached to the trailer, it seems to be.
[17:41.280 --> 17:44.320]  I guess when it's not your car, you don't care if somebody beats the shit out of it.
[17:45.640 --> 17:46.700]  I'm sorry, is this a lease?
[17:47.360 --> 17:48.780]  This is some rocky road, son.
[17:49.020 --> 17:49.380]  Gavin!
[17:49.680 --> 17:51.740]  Gavin's flying on this rocky road, though.
[17:52.020 --> 17:52.940]  Gavin, you're doing great.
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.640]  This is ice cream central.
[17:55.120 --> 17:58.980]  Hey, I might recommend throwing it into four-wheel drive if you're on rocks.
[17:59.540 --> 18:00.420]  Your car has that.
[18:00.500 --> 18:02.080]  I think you're right, because I almost tipped it.
[18:02.500 --> 18:03.740]  Yeah, it's not auto-enabled.
[18:03.740 --> 18:05.680]  Yeah, I think you're definitely gonna need it, because you're...
[18:06.300 --> 18:08.520]  You're the second you get off the street.
[18:08.860 --> 18:09.400]  That's a lot of rocks.
[18:10.000 --> 18:10.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:10.820 --> 18:12.100]  I haven't seen rocks yet.
[18:12.180 --> 18:12.900]  Send me home, Andrew.
[18:14.880 --> 18:15.300]  Oh, yeah.
[18:15.560 --> 18:21.040]  Also, if you get kind of, like, stuck on loose rocks, sometimes they get...
[18:21.040 --> 18:22.160]  It gets a bit swimmy.
[18:22.280 --> 18:24.220]  If you honk your horn a bunch, it can dislodge the rocks.
[18:24.300 --> 18:24.820]  Oh, okay.
[18:25.240 --> 18:25.980]  Yeah, I got a bit...
[18:25.980 --> 18:27.720]  It was like I was aquaplaning a little bit.
[18:28.240 --> 18:28.540]  Yeah.
[18:28.980 --> 18:29.820]  You're hitting the tree.
[18:29.980 --> 18:30.520]  You're hitting the tree.
[18:30.900 --> 18:32.240]  Yep, I can see.
[18:33.860 --> 18:37.340]  Geoff, eventually, if you have time, you're not in the middle of anything.
[18:38.220 --> 18:40.940]  Andrew and Nick might need help.
[18:41.520 --> 18:45.460]  I think I'm about to have to run over and help him, because I'm pretty sure I had...
[18:45.460 --> 18:47.520]  I brought... I guess wrong on the saddle.
[18:49.040 --> 18:49.780]  Ah, shit.
[18:50.400 --> 18:50.900]  Saddle up, cowboy.
[18:51.400 --> 18:53.900]  Not a problem, but I don't think it'll go.
[18:54.420 --> 18:59.100]  What if after this, you instituted a leasing system with a punishment,
[18:59.260 --> 19:00.360]  if people fuck up your truck?
[19:00.460 --> 19:01.220]  Dude, it doesn't matter.
[19:01.220 --> 19:01.860]  I was just joking.
[19:01.980 --> 19:03.060]  It doesn't matter if you fuck up my truck.
[19:03.120 --> 19:05.560]  It fixes itself as soon as I leave the game.
[19:05.740 --> 19:06.280]  Oh, shit.
[19:07.080 --> 19:08.180]  Eric, what am I gonna do there?
[19:10.260 --> 19:10.580]  I...
[19:11.960 --> 19:14.440]  You have to try to barge it, right?
[19:14.480 --> 19:15.900]  You gotta ford the river, don't you think?
[19:16.180 --> 19:16.500]  Okay.
[19:17.300 --> 19:18.860]  I mean, what else can you do?
[19:19.020 --> 19:21.020]  I don't know where else you could go from there, though.
[19:21.380 --> 19:22.220]  Do bricks float?
[19:23.700 --> 19:25.020]  Do you think it's gonna be deep?
[19:25.100 --> 19:26.180]  Do you think it's gonna be that deep?
[19:27.020 --> 19:27.660]  Oh, shit.
[19:27.940 --> 19:28.180]  Oh, boy.
[19:28.400 --> 19:29.060]  Oh, man.
[19:29.220 --> 19:30.120]  Have a look at your map again.
[19:30.200 --> 19:30.900]  Have a look at your map again.
[19:30.900 --> 19:32.820]  Uh, should I go help Gavin?
[19:33.540 --> 19:34.460]  No, you don't need...
[19:34.460 --> 19:35.080]  You don't need...
[19:35.080 --> 19:35.980]  Gavin doesn't need help.
[19:36.080 --> 19:37.080]  Nick and Andrew need help.
[19:37.200 --> 19:37.700]  Nick and Andrew.
[19:38.140 --> 19:38.420]  Let's see.
[19:38.500 --> 19:39.040]  Hold on.
[19:39.560 --> 19:40.680]  I'll let you know when I need help.
[19:41.920 --> 19:42.780]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:42.780 --> 19:43.500]  Try that. Try that.
[19:44.100 --> 19:44.780]  Yeah, for it.
[19:45.200 --> 19:46.060]  Oh, yeah, for it.
[19:46.280 --> 19:46.620]  For it.
[19:46.800 --> 19:47.180]  For it!
[19:47.640 --> 19:48.040]  Yeah!
[19:48.620 --> 19:49.220]  Nice. Okay.
[19:49.800 --> 19:50.060]  Okay.
[19:50.440 --> 19:51.760]  Problem is you lost your load.
[19:52.400 --> 19:52.780]  I did.
[19:53.640 --> 19:54.760]  What do we do without that?
[19:55.780 --> 19:59.860]  We'll need to go back for you to reload it or to get a crane.
[19:59.860 --> 20:00.500]  That looks so deep.
[20:01.020 --> 20:04.660]  What if you shoot right near those rocks and try to hit like that little island?
[20:04.780 --> 20:05.760]  Yeah, but then where do you go from there?
[20:05.940 --> 20:09.180]  Are you sure you don't need me to come help, Gav?
[20:10.020 --> 20:10.660]  Yeah, you...
[20:11.100 --> 20:12.160]  You might want to...
[20:12.160 --> 20:14.100]  You might want to...
[20:14.100 --> 20:14.900]  I'm not that far from it.
[20:14.920 --> 20:15.780]  I'm going to recover. I'll be back.
[20:15.880 --> 20:15.980]  Yeah.
[20:16.460 --> 20:18.860]  I was about to recover, so before I do that, let me...
[20:19.580 --> 20:23.180]  It's not a help situation yet, but boy, it might be soon.
[20:23.800 --> 20:24.860]  All right, so...
[20:24.860 --> 20:26.260]  God, where do you go from here, man?
[20:26.280 --> 20:29.140]  The vehicle I'm in is going to be better in the water than the one he's in.
[20:29.140 --> 20:29.340]  Okay.
[20:29.420 --> 20:30.680]  So I might be able to pull him across.
[20:30.680 --> 20:32.680]  Yeah, I mean, I would say do that.
[20:33.080 --> 20:33.820]  All right, on my way.
[20:34.720 --> 20:35.040]  Where...
[20:35.360 --> 20:36.700]  Gavin, where do you go from here?
[20:36.800 --> 20:40.660]  I'm just going to go over every mound I can see because it's the shallowest, maybe.
[20:40.840 --> 20:42.760]  Oh, this is trees, though. This is awful.
[20:43.120 --> 20:44.260]  Yeah, this is not good, dude.
[20:45.400 --> 20:48.860]  I don't remember ever crossing where Gavin's crossing right now.
[20:48.880 --> 20:49.720]  I don't know if it's possible.
[20:50.420 --> 20:52.200]  So I got to go look at it and see if it's...
[20:52.200 --> 20:53.580]  I just got to jog my memory or...
[20:53.580 --> 20:54.160]  You got...
[20:54.160 --> 20:55.340]  Oh, you might be mudded in, bud.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.940]  I know we've got no face cams, but I'm doing the Michael Scott lip bite thing right now.
[21:01.440 --> 21:04.120]  I'm through gritted teeth, dude. This is rough.
[21:06.660 --> 21:07.400]  On my way, Nick!
[21:07.720 --> 21:12.360]  Geoff, Geoff, we might need some help, but Gavin's doing a great job here.
[21:13.720 --> 21:18.400]  Well, Gavin's had, you know, he's had some expert tutelage from Antonio and Burndog, so...
[21:18.400 --> 21:19.340]  Oh, is that right?
[21:19.580 --> 21:20.220]  He's got some skills.
[21:20.480 --> 21:21.740]  You know, this is part of WUB life.
[21:21.760 --> 21:22.600]  Don't sleep on Gavin.
[21:23.060 --> 21:23.240]  Yeah.
[21:23.660 --> 21:24.840]  He's in... he's WUB Corps.
[21:25.140 --> 21:26.060]  Yeah, I hear that.
[21:26.940 --> 21:30.480]  Oh, I lost the...
[21:32.660 --> 21:34.500]  That's okay, if you just hold out for a minute, I got a crane coming.
[21:34.500 --> 21:35.640]  All right, I got it. I flipped it.
[21:35.700 --> 21:36.020]  Nice.
[21:38.320 --> 21:39.220]  All right, let's see.
[21:41.820 --> 21:43.760]  All right, I need gas too, pretty bad.
[21:45.040 --> 21:45.880]  I can get you some.
[21:45.920 --> 21:46.540]  Let me go low.
[21:47.500 --> 21:49.720]  I have seven gallons left of 53.
[21:52.820 --> 21:54.680]  But I could go back to the...
[21:54.680 --> 21:55.980]  Oh, Gavin, this is tough, dude.
[21:57.240 --> 21:58.820]  I don't... I should be there...
[21:58.820 --> 21:59.780]  This wipes my mouth.
[22:02.780 --> 22:06.300]  It's just fun to drive anywhere in this game and do anything.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.980]  Once you can, that's the thing.
[22:09.400 --> 22:09.660]  Yep.
[22:10.160 --> 22:12.000]  It's earning the ability to do that.
[22:12.120 --> 22:16.920]  Yeah, there's a bit of a learning curve and it takes a little bit to unlock the good stuff, but...
[22:16.920 --> 22:18.580]  I've blown almost half a tank of fuel.
[22:18.740 --> 22:19.720]  I might make this, you know?
[22:22.660 --> 22:23.640]  Dude, Gavin.
[22:24.360 --> 22:25.080]  Come on, man.
[22:25.080 --> 22:26.720]  You got this, let's go.
[22:26.800 --> 22:27.680]  This truck rolls.
[22:28.000 --> 22:29.080]  Yeah, it's a good one, man.
[22:30.620 --> 22:31.900]  It defies physics.
[22:33.080 --> 22:34.820]  Is there gas at the drilling site, Geoff?
[22:36.280 --> 22:37.600]  I don't know, I don't think so.
[22:38.140 --> 22:40.320]  I think there might be some across from it, though.
[22:42.140 --> 22:43.960]  Dude, Gavin, way to go.
[22:44.820 --> 22:46.320]  Dude, it looks like you've already done it, Gavin.
[22:46.500 --> 22:47.980]  He did, he just got through.
[22:48.060 --> 22:48.880]  I'm just gonna...
[22:48.880 --> 22:50.300]  He did a great job, that rocked.
[22:50.300 --> 22:52.740]  I went in low gear a little bit, but I got there.
[22:53.240 --> 22:54.140]  How far is that?
[22:54.320 --> 22:56.360]  I'm gonna un-fuck my mistake, and then...
[22:58.180 --> 22:59.000]  Yeah, same here.
[22:59.300 --> 23:01.220]  You gotta be close at this point, then, yeah, Gavin?
[23:01.700 --> 23:03.340]  I think so, close to the dam.
[23:04.260 --> 23:04.620]  Wild.
[23:04.960 --> 23:08.560]  Man, this is the most progress I've ever made in a trucks video, I think.
[23:08.660 --> 23:09.920]  This is a good-ass truck.
[23:12.820 --> 23:13.280]  All right.
[23:13.380 --> 23:13.980]  Well, that didn't work.
[23:15.260 --> 23:16.440]  What did you try to do, Nick?
[23:18.260 --> 23:18.980]  Uh, nothing.
[23:19.620 --> 23:19.980]  Nothing.
[23:22.980 --> 23:25.180]  I drove through a tree, incidentally.
[23:26.120 --> 23:27.020]  Oh, Nick!
[23:27.600 --> 23:29.080]  Fuck me in the go-down!
[23:30.840 --> 23:32.860]  Hey, hey, uh, Andrew?
[23:33.340 --> 23:33.560]  Yep?
[23:34.260 --> 23:35.220]  Uh, Nick's sideways again.
[23:36.000 --> 23:37.260]  Okay, I'm on my way.
[23:37.600 --> 23:38.180]  I'm almost there.
[23:38.940 --> 23:40.460]  I have more weight, so it should be easier.
[23:40.480 --> 23:43.680]  Now, Nick, when you go sideways, are you losing your bricks?
[23:44.380 --> 23:45.100]  Oh, yeah, he is.
[23:45.100 --> 23:46.880]  So I had to put a crane on, so I'm gonna retreat.
[23:46.900 --> 23:47.700]  No, I didn't lose bricks.
[23:48.380 --> 23:50.920]  If they're still in the back, but they're loose,
[23:50.920 --> 23:54.400]  hit up on the D-pad, go to cargo, and hit repack cargo,
[23:54.600 --> 23:55.800]  and it'll lock them back into place.
[23:56.640 --> 23:59.200]  If that doesn't work, it means you left bricks on the ground.
[23:59.260 --> 24:00.300]  Well, I didn't lose bricks.
[24:00.480 --> 24:01.680]  I lost metal beams.
[24:01.940 --> 24:02.780]  Oh, metal beams, yeah.
[24:02.800 --> 24:03.870]  They're definitely gone, so...
[24:05.620 --> 24:06.000]  Yeah.
[24:06.180 --> 24:07.520]  Do you have any metal beams?
[24:07.540 --> 24:08.360]  Uh, no.
[24:08.880 --> 24:09.580]  Oh, I got them.
[24:09.680 --> 24:10.220]  I got them.
[24:10.280 --> 24:10.800]  I'll help him.
[24:11.600 --> 24:12.080]  What do you have?
[24:12.820 --> 24:13.640]  You're gonna need...
[24:14.260 --> 24:18.160]  To put the metal beams back in, you're gonna need to put three physical beams in
[24:18.160 --> 24:19.560]  to reconstitute the full thing.
[24:19.560 --> 24:21.860]  So if there aren't three there, you have to find the other three.
[24:21.880 --> 24:22.220]  Oh, shit.
[24:22.540 --> 24:22.700]  Yeah, you're right.
[24:22.700 --> 24:23.500]  Just FYI.
[24:23.920 --> 24:24.820]  You're like a trackopedia.
[24:25.480 --> 24:25.880]  Thank you.
[24:27.080 --> 24:28.220]  I'm all worthless as shit.
[24:28.980 --> 24:30.080]  Well, it's not worthless, but...
[24:30.740 --> 24:31.420]  I mean, this is...
[24:31.420 --> 24:31.880]  It's a tough...
[24:31.880 --> 24:33.260]  This is a tough business, man.
[24:33.440 --> 24:35.760]  That's why not everybody runs out of high school to be
[24:35.760 --> 24:40.160]  fuckin' long-distance, difficult equipment truck drivers.
[24:40.980 --> 24:43.080]  What do you mean?
[24:43.100 --> 24:44.280]  I'm where I was, except...
[24:45.200 --> 24:46.700]  Like, a couple feet from...
[24:50.920 --> 24:51.440]  What?
[24:51.580 --> 24:52.400]  Why, Nick?
[24:53.080 --> 24:53.700]  Why what?
[24:54.180 --> 24:56.660]  Just all of it, just why to all of it?
[24:56.700 --> 24:58.780]  Is this you or is this your trailer?
[24:59.360 --> 25:00.340]  I think this is you.
[25:00.940 --> 25:02.660]  It's both of us, we're attached.
[25:03.300 --> 25:05.400]  Okay, oh, well, great.
[25:06.140 --> 25:06.660]  Great.
[25:08.460 --> 25:08.980]  Fuckin'...
[25:08.980 --> 25:13.480]  Ah, Geoff, we might be, uh, Geoff, we might be in it.
[25:13.860 --> 25:14.940]  We're in trouble now.
[25:14.940 --> 25:17.640]  I'm proud of Gavin. Gavin's killing it.
[25:17.640 --> 25:19.460]  It's just the wrong frickin...
[25:19.460 --> 25:19.680]  What?
[25:19.840 --> 25:20.280]  I...
[25:20.820 --> 25:21.940]  Did you go to the wrong place?
[25:22.100 --> 25:25.000]  I appreciate you trying to fix things, Nick. Next time just...
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.920]  I think you just need to go to Smithville Dam, bud.
[25:27.080 --> 25:27.740]  So as long as you...
[25:27.740 --> 25:28.520]  What did you do? You didn't...
[25:28.520 --> 25:29.800]  Oh, it's just I'm not tracking it right.
[25:29.880 --> 25:33.820]  I didn't... if we didn't have to go back up here, I could have just...
[25:33.820 --> 25:36.120]  used the crane and loaded you up.
[25:36.320 --> 25:38.740]  You went backwards up the hill.
[25:39.180 --> 25:39.460]  Yeah.
[25:40.580 --> 25:41.660]  And now he's sideways.
[25:41.660 --> 25:45.280]  You put yourself in such a worse position than where you left.
[25:46.300 --> 25:48.860]  Hey, Andrew, Geoff can't see what you're doing.
[25:48.940 --> 25:51.640]  Do you want to... you want to catch him up on how you're doing with, uh...
[25:51.640 --> 25:53.600]  Uh, well, Nick fell over.
[25:53.720 --> 25:56.920]  He tipped his truck, lost his beams, but the beams are still intact.
[25:56.980 --> 25:59.300]  So they're gonna be, uh, retrievable.
[25:59.540 --> 26:00.140]  That's awesome.
[26:00.240 --> 26:03.380]  So I got a crane and then Nick was all good when I left.
[26:03.460 --> 26:07.400]  And then I came back about five minutes later and Nick was on his side
[26:07.400 --> 26:11.000]  further up the mountain going opposite of where he needs to go.
[26:11.560 --> 26:16.860]  And, uh, I kind of tipped over trying to... trying to help him because it is a bad road.
[26:16.920 --> 26:17.320]  Oh, don't.
[26:17.400 --> 26:18.920]  Which is why he fell in the first time.
[26:19.260 --> 26:23.260]  What I'm hearing is that you guys are both in, uh, dire straits, sort of.
[26:23.300 --> 26:24.740]  Yeah, we're both on our sides.
[26:24.860 --> 26:27.380]  Gavin's not even in Black River anymore, so it's gonna have to be me.
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.480]  All right, let me, uh, let me pull over here when I get to a safe spot.
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.380]  And then I'll hop up back into the garage and I'll pick up something to come get you boys.
[26:36.760 --> 26:37.640]  Uh, okay.
[26:38.080 --> 26:43.200]  Should there be an unwritten rule that, like, even if you could save yourself, you have to call for help?
[26:43.780 --> 26:47.160]  Because I could pretty easily just recover and then try to do this again,
[26:47.200 --> 26:50.480]  but I think it's way better if someone else has to now come save both of us.
[26:50.900 --> 26:54.960]  I have a feeling I'm not going to personally accomplish a single thing today, but that's okay.
[26:55.760 --> 26:56.260]  Let's see.
[26:56.280 --> 26:58.960]  Hey, I was... I was well on my way to accomplishing something.
[26:59.280 --> 26:59.680]  Uh...
[26:59.680 --> 27:01.380]  And then Andrew led me down a stupid road.
[27:02.660 --> 27:06.560]  Let's go ahead and throw a crane on that just to be safe because it seems like it might be...
[27:06.560 --> 27:06.700]  No.
[27:07.480 --> 27:08.340]  No, that's...
[27:08.980 --> 27:09.660]  No, Nick.
[27:09.780 --> 27:09.800]  What?
[27:09.800 --> 27:10.360]  No, Nick.
[27:10.360 --> 27:10.680]  What?
[27:11.020 --> 27:11.620]  No, Nick.
[27:11.680 --> 27:13.060]  What do you mean? You took us around a winding road!
[27:13.060 --> 27:17.400]  I took us down a road and then you fell and then I saved you and I said,
[27:17.740 --> 27:22.520]  stay here and then you went up the road that you're calling stupid and fell again.
[27:23.620 --> 27:25.400]  Who's the menace of that duo?
[27:26.420 --> 27:27.660]  It sounds like it's Nick.
[27:27.980 --> 27:29.240]  It's definitely Nick.
[27:29.580 --> 27:30.540]  No, it's Twofer.
[27:31.760 --> 27:32.360]  Oh, I'm hearing it.
[27:32.500 --> 27:34.520]  It may be... it may possibly just be...
[27:34.520 --> 27:36.420]  It's Nick and it's not close.
[27:36.860 --> 27:39.020]  How did you... how did you... hey, did you fall too?
[27:39.660 --> 27:43.880]  I did because you put yourself up the road that you called a bad road.
[27:44.040 --> 27:44.940]  Yeah, I needed gas.
[27:45.800 --> 27:47.960]  I said I would fill you up with gas.
[27:48.620 --> 27:49.500]  You're gonna fill me up?
[27:50.240 --> 27:50.460]  Yep.
[27:50.800 --> 27:51.720]  What are you talking about? Cheek to cheek.
[27:52.460 --> 27:53.020]  Back to the past.
[27:53.320 --> 27:56.200]  Nick is the menace. Nick is absolutely the menace.
[27:56.480 --> 28:00.600]  Nick seems to be in sort of dismissive not listening mode in there from what I can hear.
[28:02.220 --> 28:02.760]  What'd you say?
[28:03.220 --> 28:04.780]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay.
[28:05.000 --> 28:05.880]  Alright, I'm on my way to get you.
[28:06.700 --> 28:08.960]  You know what, Andrew? I don't blame you. I blame you.
[28:09.060 --> 28:10.320]  Well, that's very big of you. Thank you.
[28:10.340 --> 28:13.660]  I don't... but Andrew, I don't blame... like, there was any blame to go around.
[28:13.820 --> 28:14.100]  Andrew, I don't blame you.
[28:14.100 --> 28:18.600]  Well, I will say that we could have taken a more... a more, uh, less, uh, windy road.
[28:18.680 --> 28:19.640]  But it's okay. It's alright.
[28:20.620 --> 28:21.220]  I followed you.
[28:21.460 --> 28:23.900]  Gavin, how you been doing? You been taking more or less windy roads?
[28:24.980 --> 28:26.620]  Yeah, just winding my way to the farm.
[28:26.700 --> 28:27.480]  Let's look at this...
[28:27.480 --> 28:29.520]  Oh, shit. I'm cooking.
[28:29.860 --> 28:32.140]  Oh, you're flying, dude. Are you still in four-wheel drive?
[28:33.040 --> 28:34.080]  No, I'm out of road.
[28:34.520 --> 28:38.060]  Go south across the bridge and then take this straight dirt road.
[28:39.420 --> 28:42.600]  Without the curve through the trees. The trees were the...
[28:42.600 --> 28:43.720]  You know what? It's my fault.
[28:44.300 --> 28:47.420]  What? So you're saying we should have forded the fucking river?
[28:47.600 --> 28:50.400]  Is that your alternate path that was so much easier? Is that what you're saying?
[28:50.440 --> 28:52.480]  No, it was to go across a bridge.
[28:53.140 --> 28:53.760]  Which bridge?
[28:54.360 --> 28:56.140]  No, what I'm saying to the drill site...
[28:56.700 --> 28:57.020]  Right?
[28:57.280 --> 28:59.940]  Go here. Oh, I see. You would go down and then right.
[29:00.160 --> 29:01.500]  Yeah, go down here and then... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:01.660 --> 29:02.040]  Yeah.
[29:02.100 --> 29:02.660]  Oh, Gavin.
[29:02.660 --> 29:03.140]  I could have.
[29:03.560 --> 29:03.760]  Yeah.
[29:03.960 --> 29:06.840]  But you know what? Yours was more direct. I like it. We were going speedy.
[29:06.920 --> 29:09.820]  You know what? My problem was, Nick, I believed in you too much.
[29:09.960 --> 29:10.440]  And I learned from you.
[29:10.440 --> 29:10.800]  You know what?
[29:11.260 --> 29:13.100]  That's on me. Hey, that was my mistake.
[29:13.800 --> 29:14.200]  You know what?
[29:15.060 --> 29:16.320]  Much like my dad. You're right.
[29:16.640 --> 29:21.860]  It's so funny to hear Andrew of all people summarize how I feel about you guys every time we play this game.
[29:24.900 --> 29:25.740]  Alright, I am...
[29:27.340 --> 29:29.940]  Dude, this is Gavin's game right now.
[29:29.940 --> 29:33.920]  I feel like we potentially could have gotten these bricks from closer.
[29:35.060 --> 29:36.540]  Yeah, I feel like you're probably right.
[29:36.840 --> 29:39.180]  Well, you're going to have to go over there anyway.
[29:39.500 --> 29:39.760]  Might as well.
[29:39.820 --> 29:41.600]  Yeah, there's some on the ground right next to us.
[29:41.960 --> 29:45.320]  The bricks that are over there. Here's why you're going to want to take these bricks over there.
[29:45.380 --> 29:47.000]  Because this is a mission for this side of the map.
[29:47.400 --> 29:51.200]  Eventually, we'll go to that side of the map and it'll have a whole bunch of other missions that will require bricks.
[29:51.260 --> 29:54.520]  You're going to use the bricks over there. Then you're coming back here to get more bricks.
[29:56.160 --> 29:56.700]  There you go.
[29:57.120 --> 29:58.300]  Oh, a fuel station for Geoff.
[29:58.580 --> 29:58.900]  Load.
[29:59.320 --> 30:01.920]  What? No, don't you have to unload? Or are you loading?
[30:04.080 --> 30:04.440]  Uh...
[30:05.520 --> 30:07.400]  You right bumper or trigger until you unload.
[30:09.640 --> 30:10.640]  Oh, that's how you do it?
[30:11.180 --> 30:12.980]  Did you take it to a place that also has bricks?
[30:15.980 --> 30:18.080]  He's restocking. He's replenishing the bricks.
[30:18.620 --> 30:19.120]  A lot of space.
[30:20.400 --> 30:22.400]  You have stuff in your truck, don't you?
[30:22.760 --> 30:23.980]  You need to unload, not load.
[30:24.560 --> 30:25.460]  How do I...
[30:26.020 --> 30:28.000]  He's in the yellow thing.
[30:28.720 --> 30:30.060]  Yeah, and what does it say?
[30:30.900 --> 30:31.200]  Load.
[30:33.700 --> 30:37.260]  Alright, hold on. I'm going to stop driving for a second to look at his screen.
[30:39.560 --> 30:43.340]  I don't know where else you're supposed to go. To the red? How can you drive up to the red?
[30:43.500 --> 30:44.240]  Do you have to winch?
[30:44.280 --> 30:46.020]  It's not red, it's yellow. Hold on, let me see.
[30:46.180 --> 30:50.120]  There's a red one next to the... He's in the yellow one. There's a red one next to the yellow one.
[30:50.940 --> 30:52.060]  I'm not sure...
[30:54.760 --> 30:55.600]  Do I need a crane?
[30:57.720 --> 30:58.420]  Loading platform.
[30:58.440 --> 30:58.900]  I got a crane.
[30:59.120 --> 30:59.860]  I think you do.
[31:00.540 --> 31:01.340]  Loading platform.
[31:02.740 --> 31:03.440]  Various goods.
[31:04.060 --> 31:04.460]  That's...
[31:05.600 --> 31:08.080]  No, that's to pick those items up.
[31:08.240 --> 31:09.680]  You've placed those...
[31:09.680 --> 31:11.680]  No, you've called in those items to the platform.
[31:12.300 --> 31:13.460]  That's fine, let's ignore that.
[31:13.800 --> 31:15.440]  Is this where you're supposed to be? Right there?
[31:16.360 --> 31:18.040]  Let me see. Let me look at the mission.
[31:19.460 --> 31:20.260]  Husky forwarding...
[31:22.740 --> 31:23.140]  Essentials...
[31:23.140 --> 31:24.260]  Delivered to the farm.
[31:24.420 --> 31:25.140]  Is this not the farm?
[31:25.820 --> 31:26.800]  Oh, this is the farm.
[31:26.800 --> 31:29.660]  If it says it's the farm in Smithville Dam, then it's the farm.
[31:29.860 --> 31:31.200]  You should, uh...
[31:31.200 --> 31:33.480]  Yeah, click there. Essentials.
[31:33.960 --> 31:35.020]  Now, hit the farm.
[31:35.260 --> 31:35.960]  It'll take you right there.
[31:37.160 --> 31:38.600]  There might be another...
[31:39.000 --> 31:40.760]  Yellow space on the...
[31:40.760 --> 31:41.660]  Property you need to find.
[31:42.200 --> 31:44.280]  It's a big property, so it's gotta be somewhere else.
[31:44.460 --> 31:46.120]  Dumb as hell.
[31:47.360 --> 31:48.200]  Lock on the platform.
[31:48.800 --> 31:49.760]  Is this not close enough?
[31:49.960 --> 31:54.260]  The farm should be thankful that you brought the stuff.
[31:54.260 --> 31:55.860]  And they should let you unload it there.
[31:55.920 --> 31:56.740]  That's ridiculous.
[31:58.160 --> 32:00.900]  If that annoys you, there's gonna be so much more about this game.
[32:01.040 --> 32:01.720]  I'm gonna piss you off.
[32:03.740 --> 32:05.800]  I don't see another place, Gavin.
[32:07.740 --> 32:11.200]  I wonder if this game would be good on the steam deck for flying.
[32:11.720 --> 32:13.040]  You know what I mean?
[32:13.300 --> 32:14.760]  Would it be relaxing or would it be stressful?
[32:15.040 --> 32:18.640]  Oh my god, this stresses me out watching you guys play.
[32:18.900 --> 32:21.860]  You definitely shouldn't have to crane those items out.
[32:21.940 --> 32:22.840]  That makes no sense.
[32:23.240 --> 32:26.380]  I just don't see another place to take these.
[32:27.440 --> 32:29.580]  Oh, interesting. Geoff's going the way that I would've went.
[32:30.040 --> 32:31.660]  No, he doesn't have a trailer behind him.
[32:32.080 --> 32:34.400]  I'd love to help you, Gav, but I'm pretty far away.
[32:34.400 --> 32:35.360]  I would've gone that way too.
[32:35.980 --> 32:37.500]  Gavin, it has to be that.
[32:38.920 --> 32:39.540]  Smithville Dam.
[32:39.860 --> 32:42.760]  What if I just roll by truck and the bricks just fall there?
[32:43.060 --> 32:45.040]  I don't think that would probably be right.
[32:45.580 --> 32:46.520]  But you know what?
[32:47.140 --> 32:47.960]  You never know.
[32:48.400 --> 32:49.480]  Alright, here's what you gotta do.
[32:49.980 --> 32:51.100]  Here's what we gotta do, I think.
[32:51.100 --> 32:53.960]  Andrew, can you go to the essentials?
[32:54.180 --> 32:54.720]  Hit back.
[32:55.300 --> 32:57.240]  Tab over to contracts.
[32:57.380 --> 32:58.560]  Go down to Husky forwarding.
[32:58.960 --> 33:01.540]  Click on the essentials. Can you activate the quest?
[33:02.560 --> 33:02.700]  What?
[33:03.420 --> 33:04.220]  Sure can.
[33:05.760 --> 33:06.100]  Ooh.
[33:06.460 --> 33:09.280]  Gavin, you can go ahead and turn your bricks.
[33:09.720 --> 33:10.500]  Oh my gosh.
[33:11.740 --> 33:12.800]  Oh, that's a little...
[33:12.800 --> 33:15.720]  How long did you guys sit on one of those?
[33:19.020 --> 33:20.140]  Go back to beams.
[33:20.520 --> 33:21.860]  Alright, Gavin, let's see.
[33:22.100 --> 33:23.160]  Oh my god, Gavin.
[33:24.180 --> 33:24.640]  Load.
[33:25.360 --> 33:25.780]  Nope.
[33:26.300 --> 33:27.160]  But I don't wanna load.
[33:27.620 --> 33:29.000]  Alright, go.
[33:29.640 --> 33:30.360]  Highlight it again.
[33:30.500 --> 33:31.860]  Let me see.
[33:33.240 --> 33:34.100]  Loading cargo.
[33:37.160 --> 33:40.180]  This is the loading cargo platform.
[33:40.180 --> 33:43.400]  Is it because I've put this stupid box in the way of where it should go?
[33:44.360 --> 33:45.320]  Is it because I've put this stupid box in the way of where it should go?
[33:46.620 --> 33:47.740]  How do I delete that?
[33:48.920 --> 33:51.700]  How do you play this game for a thousand hours?
[33:52.040 --> 33:53.320]  You're... this is... you're...
[33:53.320 --> 33:54.620]  There's something wrong with you guys.
[33:54.840 --> 33:55.980]  This is crazy.
[33:57.980 --> 33:59.340]  This is what we like to problem solve.
[34:00.540 --> 34:01.580]  I can hear Geoff.
[34:02.380 --> 34:02.980]  Yeah, I hear him.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.140]  I'm sorry, I would really love to be able to help.
[34:05.360 --> 34:07.240]  My focus is split between the...
[34:07.240 --> 34:08.060]  Yeah, that's fine.
[34:08.800 --> 34:09.640]  I'll try to check it out.
[34:10.160 --> 34:11.760]  After this, you won't need to help us anymore.
[34:11.760 --> 34:13.780]  Yeah, fucking right.
[34:13.900 --> 34:15.600]  Get real.
[34:16.260 --> 34:17.850]  Get fucking real.
[34:18.720 --> 34:19.160]  I am real.
[34:19.160 --> 34:20.440]  You're out of your mind.
[34:20.860 --> 34:24.520]  It's the second time you've been on your fucking ass.
[34:24.520 --> 34:26.200]  Oh, I was trying to solve a problem.
[34:26.640 --> 34:27.120]  Get real.
[34:27.820 --> 34:28.780]  Do something else. Don't move yet.
[34:29.520 --> 34:31.060]  Go back.
[34:31.240 --> 34:32.860]  Go over to the contracts again.
[34:34.820 --> 34:35.440]  Uh...
[34:35.440 --> 34:36.940]  Husky forwarding.
[34:37.440 --> 34:39.440]  What was it? Essentials.
[34:39.440 --> 34:40.660]  Start tracking.
[34:42.040 --> 34:44.760]  So he had to start and I had to track it.
[34:45.520 --> 34:46.340]  There you go.
[34:46.540 --> 34:47.880]  Right trigger over to...
[34:47.880 --> 34:49.140]  No, no, no. Listen. Right trigger.
[34:49.640 --> 34:50.080]  Oh.
[34:51.200 --> 34:52.060]  Unload bricks.
[34:52.180 --> 34:53.220]  Holy shit.
[34:55.920 --> 34:57.600]  This game sucks.
[34:59.060 --> 35:00.440]  It's a great game.
[35:00.900 --> 35:01.860]  Don't say those words.
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.440]  That's not true.
[35:02.500 --> 35:03.480]  That's ridiculous.
[35:04.720 --> 35:07.680]  You just gotta pay attention to what you're doing.
[35:08.600 --> 35:10.300]  Sometimes you flip a truck
[35:10.300 --> 35:11.560]  and you wait the rest of the video
[35:11.560 --> 35:12.400]  for something to happen.
[35:13.400 --> 35:15.420]  Paying attention to what you're doing,
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.560]  would that have solved the issue
[35:17.560 --> 35:18.200]  that you were in?
[35:19.020 --> 35:20.320]  I mean, not for me, because I'm an idiot.
[35:21.440 --> 35:22.400]  For anyone.
[35:22.740 --> 35:25.660]  I've been watching your four screens
[35:25.660 --> 35:26.580]  and all of this.
[35:26.720 --> 35:28.540]  I never would have thought, oh yeah.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.240]  The specific order in which tracking
[35:31.240 --> 35:32.140]  must occur.
[35:32.640 --> 35:35.040]  It's not a specific order.
[35:35.040 --> 35:36.260]  You just had to track it.
[35:36.320 --> 35:37.520]  He just had to activate the quest.
[35:37.620 --> 35:41.340]  You have to be tracking any quest that you do.
[35:41.800 --> 35:42.820]  And I was trying to
[35:42.820 --> 35:44.640]  hit right on the d-pad
[35:44.640 --> 35:47.040]  maybe like ten times before he
[35:48.180 --> 35:49.020]  made it official.
[35:49.640 --> 35:51.260]  I just didn't try after that.
[35:52.320 --> 35:53.400]  Should I keep doing the essentials?
[35:54.660 --> 35:55.220]  Uh, yeah.
[35:55.480 --> 35:56.000]  Might as well.
[35:56.200 --> 35:58.160]  Wooden planks. Oh, are they in this area?
[35:58.660 --> 36:00.920]  Yeah, but how do you get over there?
[36:01.360 --> 36:01.680]  Drive.
[36:02.440 --> 36:02.800]  Anyway.
[36:04.740 --> 36:05.440]  Right on, man.
[36:05.880 --> 36:07.220]  I don't know how to get around you.
[36:08.800 --> 36:10.240]  Can I just push you over?
[36:10.740 --> 36:11.780]  You might be able to.
[36:11.860 --> 36:12.340]  I'll try.
[36:13.360 --> 36:15.720]  Well, I don't get to drive in real life.
[36:15.920 --> 36:18.220]  If I could get to the other side, I'd be fine.
[36:18.300 --> 36:18.860]  You're almost there.
[36:19.440 --> 36:20.400]  You should do it, man.
[36:20.420 --> 36:21.740]  You're good at driving.
[36:25.060 --> 36:26.820]  Tell Meg you want a chance next time.
[36:26.980 --> 36:27.320]  That's helping.
[36:27.740 --> 36:30.560]  Oh, you got it.
[36:30.560 --> 36:31.220]  You got it.
[36:31.500 --> 36:33.920]  Wedge me up.
[36:34.820 --> 36:35.700]  Nice, Geoff.
[36:35.800 --> 36:37.500]  Great job, Geoff.
[36:37.600 --> 36:39.120]  He just gets the steel and leaves.
[36:41.000 --> 36:41.600]  The essentials.
[36:42.220 --> 36:43.560]  I could fucking do that, actually.
[36:44.400 --> 36:45.440]  That'd be pretty funny.
[36:46.320 --> 36:47.860]  You don't have room for both.
[36:48.760 --> 36:50.800]  You have to leave us, which would actually be funnier.
[36:50.900 --> 36:51.180]  I'm up.
[36:52.340 --> 36:54.700]  Nick is up, so I'll let you...
[36:55.920 --> 36:56.300]  Why don't you
[36:56.300 --> 36:57.960]  get out of the way so I can get Andrew.
[36:57.960 --> 37:00.480]  Alright, let me drive forward and then I'll back up.
[37:01.320 --> 37:04.420]  Geoff, this is going to be the last time you're going to have to help Nick.
[37:04.620 --> 37:05.140]  This is going to be great.
[37:05.440 --> 37:05.900]  Last time.
[37:08.820 --> 37:10.340]  It's such a strong statement.
[37:11.640 --> 37:15.900]  It's like the craziest thing you can say in this game.
[37:16.120 --> 37:17.040]  I'm just going to go forward.
[37:17.260 --> 37:19.180]  I'm going to go full focus.
[37:19.320 --> 37:20.880]  Go over here and pull up to the left.
[37:21.980 --> 37:24.360]  God, this game is great.
[37:24.620 --> 37:26.120]  I have three gallons of gas.
[37:26.120 --> 37:27.560]  Hey, this game sucks and this game is great.
[37:28.240 --> 37:30.080]  It's because it sucks it's great.
[37:30.180 --> 37:30.940]  It's fantastic.
[37:31.280 --> 37:32.340]  It is such a mess.
[37:32.860 --> 37:34.680]  Andrew, what am I doing with you?
[37:35.020 --> 37:36.060]  Yeah, it is tricky.
[37:38.220 --> 37:39.760]  Let's get you...
[37:40.380 --> 37:41.840]  Maybe I'll go get gas.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.420]  Do I have enough gas to get the gas?
[37:43.560 --> 37:45.120]  This man is obsessed with his gas.
[37:46.080 --> 37:48.380]  It's all he can think about and it's causing his downfall.
[37:48.800 --> 37:50.140]  You don't have enough to get gas.
[37:50.620 --> 37:51.120]  Okay, sweet.
[37:51.700 --> 37:52.400]  I need gas.
[37:52.400 --> 37:53.040]  Sweet.
[37:54.680 --> 37:56.280]  Alright, I'm just going to...
[37:56.280 --> 37:57.440]  There's no...
[37:57.440 --> 37:59.600]  I'm just going to yank you out of here.
[38:00.680 --> 38:02.300]  I'm down to two gallons somehow.
[38:02.500 --> 38:03.700]  Even though I turned the engine off.
[38:07.360 --> 38:10.540]  If you've done damage to your car, you can definitely have a gas leak.
[38:11.120 --> 38:11.660]  Sweet, I might.
[38:11.680 --> 38:12.820]  I don't know if you've done damage to your car.
[38:13.760 --> 38:14.900]  It said engine damage.
[38:15.480 --> 38:16.460]  How much though?
[38:17.880 --> 38:18.280]  10%.
[38:18.280 --> 38:20.080]  That's not bad.
[38:21.180 --> 38:22.940]  Alright, I'll just get you a little bit further.
[38:23.460 --> 38:25.020]  Yup, now I'm on my back.
[38:25.640 --> 38:26.840]  Am I a dumb piece?
[38:26.960 --> 38:28.800]  Or is there no fuel along the way for me?
[38:28.920 --> 38:29.380]  I don't...
[38:29.860 --> 38:30.800]  It's hard for me to see.
[38:30.880 --> 38:32.720]  I don't know really what I'm looking for.
[38:33.660 --> 38:35.520]  Some locations, they don't have gas stations.
[38:35.680 --> 38:38.220]  They just have fuel tankers around the map.
[38:38.520 --> 38:39.160]  You have to look for them.
[38:40.380 --> 38:45.260]  We're going to pretty remote places here in the world.
[38:46.220 --> 38:46.920]  Alright, where am I?
[38:46.920 --> 38:48.980]  I'm going to have to turn around and get gasoline.
[38:50.920 --> 38:53.400]  Gavin, your car probably has...
[38:53.400 --> 38:54.260]  No, it doesn't.
[38:54.460 --> 38:55.880]  It doesn't have extra gas.
[38:57.400 --> 38:59.320]  It's not a feature of that car.
[38:59.900 --> 39:01.420]  I probably shouldn't drive there in reverse.
[39:01.620 --> 39:03.300]  That would not do favors for my gas.
[39:03.880 --> 39:04.180]  No.
[39:04.340 --> 39:07.140]  Nick, I'm going to need you to cross the water there if you could.
[39:07.640 --> 39:08.080]  Sure.
[39:09.220 --> 39:10.960]  You got it. One moment.
[39:11.360 --> 39:12.440]  Alright, I'm on my way.
[39:12.720 --> 39:14.280]  Woah, what is happening to me?
[39:15.280 --> 39:17.120]  Why am I shooting fire out?
[39:17.500 --> 39:18.300]  What is going on?
[39:18.740 --> 39:21.220]  Where are all these sparks coming from?
[39:24.040 --> 39:25.920]  We're having such different games.
[39:28.920 --> 39:29.580]  Guys?
[39:33.060 --> 39:34.480]  Let me see if I can help with that.
[39:35.120 --> 39:35.940]  Oh my god.
[39:38.740 --> 39:40.340]  I've got you right...
[39:40.340 --> 39:41.360]  No, upside down.
[39:42.780 --> 39:44.400]  I've got you right...
[39:45.400 --> 39:45.940]  There you go.
[39:46.140 --> 39:48.500]  Right side up on my screen.
[39:49.140 --> 39:51.580]  What the fuck was that sparking?
[39:52.040 --> 39:53.180]  I've never seen that.
[39:53.720 --> 39:54.580]  You think what I'm thinking, Geoff?
[39:55.060 --> 39:55.360]  Yeah.
[39:56.500 --> 39:57.580]  Please don't leave me.
[40:01.960 --> 40:03.520]  I'm cold and there might be wolves.
[40:08.480 --> 40:10.240]  Nick, come here and I'll load you up, buddy.
[40:10.240 --> 40:12.540]  Uh, with gas?
[40:13.460 --> 40:14.800]  Oh, right. You don't have any fucking gas.
[40:15.860 --> 40:16.400]  Never mind.
[40:17.060 --> 40:18.580]  You're good where you are.
[40:19.420 --> 40:20.020]  Ah, shit.
[40:20.200 --> 40:20.960]  Can I help with this?
[40:21.660 --> 40:22.240]  Out of fuel.
[40:24.540 --> 40:24.840]  Woah.
[40:26.880 --> 40:27.480]  Woah.
[40:28.120 --> 40:29.460]  Andrew, you're...
[40:29.460 --> 40:30.980]  Oh, man.
[40:31.280 --> 40:32.660]  Oh, man.
[40:32.780 --> 40:36.000]  Oh, man.
[40:36.400 --> 40:38.200]  These are some heavy metal beams
[40:38.200 --> 40:41.240]  Oh, these beams weigh a whole lot.
[40:42.480 --> 40:46.100]  If we could have given fuel to Nick, it would have been okay.
[40:47.480 --> 40:50.200]  Nick is now upright, but has no fuel.
[40:50.560 --> 40:51.420]  He's too far.
[40:51.580 --> 40:53.020]  He's too far to give fuel to.
[40:53.260 --> 40:55.220]  Gavin, you need to come back here.
[40:55.820 --> 40:56.180]  Who, me?
[40:56.600 --> 40:57.540]  We need fuel.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.440]  Gavin needs fuel.
[41:03.800 --> 41:05.620]  How can we bring gas?
[41:06.980 --> 41:08.340]  Can you guys, like, haul a bird?
[41:11.540 --> 41:13.780]  I'm not sure I'm going to make it to my fuel, you know.
[41:13.960 --> 41:15.520]  Yeah, no, I don't think you are.
[41:15.920 --> 41:16.180]  Wait.
[41:18.240 --> 41:20.220]  Can you get closer, Nick, at all?
[41:20.980 --> 41:22.280]  I am out of fuel.
[41:22.720 --> 41:25.220]  I can refuel you if you just got a little closer.
[41:25.680 --> 41:26.220]  Alright, hold on.
[41:26.240 --> 41:27.360]  I'm going to unhandbrake.
[41:31.440 --> 41:32.160]  And, um...
[41:32.160 --> 41:33.040]  Oh, I'm rolling back.
[41:33.040 --> 41:34.260]  I'm rolling back.
[41:34.620 --> 41:36.920]  Roll, roll, roll, roll.
[41:39.520 --> 41:40.760]  Hold on. Keep going.
[41:41.300 --> 41:43.100]  Hold on. Oh, come on.
[41:48.990 --> 41:49.910]  Keep going.
[41:50.590 --> 41:52.050]  Still too far.
[41:52.130 --> 41:54.190]  Come on, baby, I just want some gas.
[41:56.110 --> 41:57.590]  Oh, you're so close.
[41:57.930 --> 41:59.850]  So fucking funny.
[42:00.070 --> 42:01.210]  That is so fucking funny.
[42:01.210 --> 42:02.190]  Come on.
[42:03.670 --> 42:04.610]  Okay, hold on.
[42:05.490 --> 42:06.350]  Come on.
[42:07.230 --> 42:09.790]  I'm just mashing it, trying to get you.
[42:10.190 --> 42:10.470]  Come on.
[42:11.030 --> 42:11.510]  Come on.
[42:14.490 --> 42:16.550]  Yeah, I'm stuck.
[42:18.510 --> 42:19.210]  Hold on.
[42:22.850 --> 42:25.490]  This is a... There's a lot going on
[42:25.490 --> 42:27.490]  in this episode of Trucks, boys.
[42:27.790 --> 42:29.050]  It's a busy episode of Trucks.
[42:29.690 --> 42:30.470]  We're back.
[42:30.930 --> 42:33.130]  And honestly, it hasn't crashed.
[42:33.430 --> 42:33.910]  Loving it.
[42:34.890 --> 42:37.190]  Oh, Gavin ran right into the fuel.
[42:37.330 --> 42:39.110]  But he got so close to the gas that he
[42:40.490 --> 42:41.370]  hit the gas.
[42:41.490 --> 42:41.790]  That's good.
[42:43.150 --> 42:44.490]  That's for refuel.
[42:45.890 --> 42:47.090]  Full gas, baby.
[42:47.390 --> 42:48.990]  Can you buy like a
[42:48.990 --> 42:50.830]  gas jug over here or something?
[42:51.650 --> 42:52.710]  Yeah, can I buy a jug?
[42:54.570 --> 42:56.230]  They got gas jugs in this game?
[42:57.350 --> 42:58.030]  Bring me jug.
[42:58.270 --> 42:59.750]  They got like a ceramic jug of gas
[42:59.750 --> 43:00.810]  in this game, Geoff?
[43:01.550 --> 43:02.430]  Uh, no.
[43:03.330 --> 43:04.410]  Well, that's not realistic.
[43:04.890 --> 43:07.030]  Wait, did I just idle a liter of fuel away already?
[43:07.270 --> 43:08.410]  Jesus. Yeah, probably.
[43:09.110 --> 43:10.330]  Jesus, this truck.
[43:14.300 --> 43:16.140]  Buddy, looking at the map, I lose fuel.
[43:17.500 --> 43:18.680]  Well, your car is on.
[43:20.220 --> 43:20.860]  Well, yeah.
[43:21.520 --> 43:21.940]  Well, yeah.
[43:21.940 --> 43:23.940]  I'm gonna fucking
[43:23.940 --> 43:25.460]  drive more fuel up, I guess.
[43:26.680 --> 43:28.280]  That guy's just futilely
[43:28.280 --> 43:29.640]  starting the engine.
[43:31.640 --> 43:33.800]  I feel like I'm listening to Yo Gabba Gabba.
[43:35.760 --> 43:38.160]  Gavin, you're our only hope for progress.
[43:39.220 --> 43:40.000]  Oh, no.
[43:40.640 --> 43:41.340]  I need to come to you.
[43:42.080 --> 43:44.200]  No, I'm saying like you keep doing what you're doing.
[43:44.280 --> 43:46.100]  You're the only one who's accomplishing anything today.
[43:46.260 --> 43:48.020]  It's true. He's been doing a lot.
[43:48.180 --> 43:50.040]  It's all the heavy lifting has been Gavin this episode.
[43:50.040 --> 43:51.240]  Yeah, this is the Gavin show.
[43:51.420 --> 43:52.340]  He got the new truck.
[43:53.680 --> 43:56.100]  I'm gonna bring a fourth truck into
[43:56.100 --> 43:58.060]  this fucking nightmare that you guys created.
[43:58.200 --> 43:59.680]  Holy shell, that's five liters.
[44:00.080 --> 44:02.140]  This truck is a
[44:02.140 --> 44:02.940]  hungry lad.
[44:03.380 --> 44:04.740]  I told you it's a gas guzzler.
[44:04.980 --> 44:07.540]  What are you doing, Nick?
[44:09.060 --> 44:09.520]  Honking.
[44:11.360 --> 44:12.060]  He's doing
[44:12.060 --> 44:14.380]  like a We Will Rock You, but stuck in the mud.
[44:15.180 --> 44:15.980]  Look, every
[44:15.980 --> 44:18.240]  once in a while, I get a little bit of movement.
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.160]  I'm trying to get
[44:22.160 --> 44:24.220]  closer to Andrew. I appreciate it.
[44:24.300 --> 44:26.260]  The editor's just gonna cut over
[44:26.260 --> 44:28.280]  to your video.
[44:28.700 --> 44:30.060]  Everyone else is kind of like stationary.
[44:30.220 --> 44:31.940]  Gavin's like doing his stuff and it's you
[44:31.940 --> 44:34.400]  slamming on the inside of your cab
[44:34.400 --> 44:35.840]  with your engine
[44:35.840 --> 44:38.260]  spinning out of fuel
[44:38.260 --> 44:39.360]  middle of the screen.
[44:39.800 --> 44:42.040]  Hey, you're welcome.
[44:42.040 --> 44:47.140]  I can't believe I'm doing this.
[44:48.340 --> 44:49.260]  You mean again?
[44:50.440 --> 44:51.740]  No, I'm doing something.
[44:51.880 --> 44:53.180]  I gave myself
[44:53.180 --> 44:56.060]  a series of checkpoints to get there
[44:56.060 --> 44:58.180]  just so I don't get lost and I drove past
[44:58.180 --> 44:59.680]  one. Oh my god.
[45:00.460 --> 45:01.480]  The worst.
[45:03.200 --> 45:04.100]  I was mad
[45:04.100 --> 45:06.020]  at myself for caring about it.
[45:06.380 --> 45:08.060]  Could you make your path in reverse from the
[45:08.060 --> 45:10.060]  destination? Yeah.
[45:10.060 --> 45:12.020]  Oh. Uh, no.
[45:12.460 --> 45:13.480]  Not with the checkpoints.
[45:13.840 --> 45:16.280]  No. That would be useful I think.
[45:16.760 --> 45:18.040]  You wouldn't clear one
[45:18.040 --> 45:19.500]  until you got to the last one.
[45:19.700 --> 45:21.100]  And then it would show you the second to last one.
[45:21.760 --> 45:23.600]  Yeah, I just feel like you should be able to number them backwards.
[45:26.880 --> 45:27.320]  Ooh.
[45:27.880 --> 45:28.920]  Oh, that looks rough, Gavin.
[45:30.420 --> 45:31.740]  Sometimes I'm using like
[45:31.740 --> 45:33.400]  25 liters a minute.
[45:34.400 --> 45:34.840]  Just to get up a hill.
[45:34.860 --> 45:37.340]  It's pretty something, man.
[45:39.100 --> 45:40.500]  It takes a lot of gas
[45:40.500 --> 45:41.260]  to be that powerful.
[45:42.140 --> 45:43.640]  That's a big boy truck you're driving.
[45:44.440 --> 45:45.560]  Pretty big boy.
[45:48.840 --> 45:49.920]  Alright, I'm
[45:49.920 --> 45:51.900]  slowly on my way
[45:51.900 --> 45:52.780]  to you guys.
[45:56.100 --> 45:58.000]  I'm gonna have my entire fucking fleet
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.040]  out here before we're done today.
[46:00.140 --> 46:00.620]  Precarious.
[46:02.200 --> 46:04.060]  Yeah, hey, I got some advice
[46:04.060 --> 46:05.980]  about that stuff. Watch out.
[46:06.740 --> 46:07.440]  Precarious-y.
[46:07.640 --> 46:10.420]  Oh, shit. Dinged up the engine real nice.
[46:11.420 --> 46:12.400]  That's how it started
[46:12.400 --> 46:14.020]  for me. You probably don't have repair
[46:14.020 --> 46:15.600]  parts on that truck. I don't think it offers them.
[46:16.640 --> 46:18.040]  No, and sometimes I'm
[46:18.040 --> 46:20.060]  just going down a hill and I lose like 17
[46:20.060 --> 46:20.880]  of something.
[46:22.160 --> 46:24.000]  The worst part is Nick's dad
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.040]  was once again in the passenger seat for it.
[46:26.600 --> 46:26.760]  Yeah.
[46:28.500 --> 46:30.040]  Silently judging, but not saying
[46:30.040 --> 46:30.360]  anything.
[46:32.020 --> 46:33.580]  Yeah, I must be leaking fuel.
[46:33.580 --> 46:35.600]  I love that you can get gas in this game without
[46:35.600 --> 46:37.580]  ever stopping. You just drive through
[46:37.580 --> 46:38.680]  the gas station slowly.
[46:38.940 --> 46:41.580]  You especially would really appreciate that.
[46:42.280 --> 46:42.680]  Oh!
[46:43.460 --> 46:45.520]  Oh, Gavin, you gotta turn right.
[46:46.040 --> 46:47.340]  Shit, son, what did I even hit?
[46:47.400 --> 46:48.200]  Was it like a stump?
[46:49.280 --> 46:51.080]  It was like a bump that led you into that
[46:51.560 --> 46:53.320]  tower. I hit a mole or something.
[46:54.860 --> 46:55.260]  Well,
[46:55.820 --> 46:57.440]  if it's any consolation,
[46:57.520 --> 46:58.180]  it didn't make it.
[47:01.080 --> 47:01.440]  Alright,
[47:01.440 --> 47:03.800]  I'm getting pretty close.
[47:04.040 --> 47:05.300]  Yeah, you're making good progress.
[47:05.680 --> 47:07.100]  You're hauling ass, Jack.
[47:07.100 --> 47:08.120]  I've got eyes on the bridge.
[47:09.920 --> 47:11.600]  The hop, skip, and a jump after that.
[47:12.040 --> 47:13.520]  Do you think they'll ever invent a car
[47:13.520 --> 47:14.480]  that runs on piss?
[47:16.020 --> 47:16.460]  Yeah.
[47:17.280 --> 47:19.740]  I mean, not as the primary fuel source.
[47:20.200 --> 47:21.700]  No, but just as like an emergency
[47:22.320 --> 47:23.220]  get me out of there.
[47:23.800 --> 47:25.180]  Do you think it would stink?
[47:25.360 --> 47:26.720]  It would just stink like piss?
[47:27.500 --> 47:28.380]  Here's a question.
[47:28.380 --> 47:29.160]  Yeah.
[47:29.620 --> 47:32.020]  If you drank gasoline and then pissed,
[47:32.940 --> 47:34.520]  could you, I mean, I know it would kill you,
[47:34.580 --> 47:35.380]  but if it didn't kill you,
[47:35.600 --> 47:38.160]  could you fuel a car
[47:38.160 --> 47:39.120]  with your gas piss?
[47:39.740 --> 47:42.280]  Well, I think, I mean, we gotta figure out what we're filming
[47:42.280 --> 47:44.080]  for like these live action days or whatever,
[47:44.200 --> 47:45.220]  so I think we gotta try it.
[47:46.140 --> 47:48.380]  Where does your body get the yellow and brown from?
[47:49.560 --> 47:49.960]  Food?
[47:50.900 --> 47:51.160]  Yeah.
[47:51.420 --> 47:53.560]  It just takes brown from food and makes it poo?
[47:53.980 --> 47:56.180]  I think it takes everything else from the food
[47:56.180 --> 47:58.740]  Yeah, what you're left with is yellow and brown, yeah.
[47:58.860 --> 48:00.320]  I think they call it the waste.
[48:00.780 --> 48:01.300]  I believe that's right.
[48:01.300 --> 48:03.660]  If I drank only milk, would it still come out yellow?
[48:04.160 --> 48:05.260]  Yes, probably.
[48:05.980 --> 48:07.920]  Well, it'd be more yellow, probably,
[48:08.040 --> 48:09.380]  because you'd be slightly dehydrated.
[48:10.580 --> 48:11.460]  You ever seen butter?
[48:12.480 --> 48:13.420]  Yeah, dude, you ever seen butter?
[48:13.840 --> 48:14.340]  Oh, shit!
[48:14.780 --> 48:17.540]  Gavin, you didn't even fucking think about butter.
[48:18.260 --> 48:19.780]  Gavin, why is milk...
[48:19.780 --> 48:20.480]  white?
[48:21.940 --> 48:23.180]  Gavin, why is milk yellow?
[48:25.600 --> 48:27.360]  I should be drinking that milk, should I?
[48:27.700 --> 48:29.100]  Gavin, why are they making me drink yellow milk?
[48:31.640 --> 48:33.440]  Why does this cow only have one udder?
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.060]  Why does it have horns?
[48:39.680 --> 48:40.840]  Alright, now I'm gonna fill Nick up.
[48:40.840 --> 48:41.840]  I can hear you!
[48:43.220 --> 48:44.060]  You're gonna fill me up?
[48:44.240 --> 48:45.280]  I'm gonna fill Nick up.
[48:45.640 --> 48:48.320]  And then what should I do?
[48:48.760 --> 48:49.060]  What do you think?
[48:49.900 --> 48:51.380]  What the hell happened to the weather?
[48:51.380 --> 48:53.440]  I don't know, it changed fast.
[48:55.500 --> 48:56.380]  Whatever they're called.
[48:56.700 --> 48:57.500]  Gavin, you're right there.
[48:57.720 --> 48:59.180]  You'll probably dump him over again.
[49:01.080 --> 49:01.960]  Luckily, Geoff...
[49:01.960 --> 49:02.980]  I'm gonna say it right now.
[49:03.920 --> 49:05.880]  This is gonna be the last time you're gonna have to help Nick.
[49:08.140 --> 49:10.020]  Technically, he never got help.
[49:10.860 --> 49:11.140]  That's true.
[49:11.460 --> 49:13.540]  No, no, no, I flipped him over.
[49:13.740 --> 49:15.140]  We weren't finished helping, though.
[49:15.160 --> 49:16.400]  We were in the process of helping.
[49:16.400 --> 49:17.920]  The act of help was not done.
[49:17.920 --> 49:20.440]  The act of helping was in progress.
[49:20.620 --> 49:22.540]  I improved his condition, he's upright.
[49:22.680 --> 49:25.060]  You did, but still in progress.
[49:25.260 --> 49:26.460]  He's not gonna slowly die
[49:26.460 --> 49:27.480]  as all the
[49:27.480 --> 49:29.100]  blood rushes to his head.
[49:29.620 --> 49:31.780]  No, he's just gonna die from exposure.
[49:32.080 --> 49:33.200]  From boredom.
[49:33.960 --> 49:36.080]  Here we are,
[49:36.320 --> 49:37.300]  coming down the street.
[49:37.700 --> 49:37.900]  Whee!
[49:41.880 --> 49:42.480]  Geoff!
[49:43.020 --> 49:44.660]  Hello, Geoff.
[49:46.260 --> 49:47.400]  I've never been so happy
[49:47.400 --> 49:48.720]  to see a vehicle through the trees.
[49:50.580 --> 49:51.380]  Alright, uh...
[49:51.380 --> 49:51.860]  Christ.
[49:52.700 --> 49:54.640]  This is a...
[49:56.200 --> 49:56.880]  Goddamn, dude.
[49:56.960 --> 49:57.600]  This is rough.
[49:58.340 --> 49:59.780]  It looks really cool from my angle.
[50:00.420 --> 50:02.400]  I'm just gonna push you out of the way a little bit.
[50:02.460 --> 50:04.820]  If I try to go around you, I'm gonna flip this thing.
[50:05.720 --> 50:06.240]  That's fair.
[50:06.560 --> 50:08.740]  I'm down to any vehicle
[50:08.740 --> 50:10.840]  I have that's really good at traversing these shitty
[50:10.840 --> 50:12.320]  conditions is pretty top-heavy.
[50:12.320 --> 50:13.660]  At this point.
[50:13.840 --> 50:14.740]  Yeah, I learned that.
[50:15.200 --> 50:17.320]  All the good stuff's...
[50:17.320 --> 50:18.960]  You guys are ready to flip.
[50:19.160 --> 50:19.840]  Fucked up? Yeah.
[50:22.480 --> 50:23.520]  Alright, uh...
[50:23.520 --> 50:24.660]  Come over here to you, Nick.
[50:25.320 --> 50:25.640]  Hello!
[50:27.780 --> 50:29.720]  You've been miserable
[50:29.720 --> 50:31.020]  the longest, I feel like.
[50:32.780 --> 50:34.060]  I made fun.
[50:34.800 --> 50:36.460]  Let's give you some gas.
[50:37.780 --> 50:38.860]  That's so close.
[50:39.580 --> 50:40.360]  Oh, I found a truck.
[50:41.660 --> 50:42.280]  Oh, nice.
[50:42.740 --> 50:44.460]  If it's a locked truck, go ahead
[50:44.460 --> 50:46.600]  and unlock it for Andrew, if you can.
[50:49.040 --> 50:50.600]  Do I go to this marker
[50:50.600 --> 50:51.620]  or do I have to go to the truck?
[50:52.000 --> 50:52.540]  Show task.
[50:55.120 --> 50:56.120]  Oh, thank you, Geoff.
[50:56.420 --> 50:58.100]  Repair the truck. No problem.
[50:58.620 --> 51:00.360]  Alright. Should I repair this truck?
[51:00.720 --> 51:02.360]  Alright, you have full gas now, buddy.
[51:02.780 --> 51:04.540]  Oh, thank you, man. You probably
[51:04.540 --> 51:05.780]  should, don't you think?
[51:06.220 --> 51:07.740]  Yeah, if you could repair your truck, I would.
[51:07.740 --> 51:09.400]  It's gonna stop me
[51:09.400 --> 51:11.180]  tracking the essentials, though, I think.
[51:11.980 --> 51:13.720]  Just retrack it.
[51:16.160 --> 51:17.200]  I need
[51:18.600 --> 51:19.640]  650 cogs.
[51:20.400 --> 51:21.660]  How many cogs do you have?
[51:23.260 --> 51:23.860]  I don't.
[51:25.340 --> 51:25.980]  Oh, wow.
[51:26.040 --> 51:27.180]  That's certainly not enough cogs.
[51:27.580 --> 51:28.880]  Yeah, it's a lack of cog.
[51:29.380 --> 51:29.600]  Yeah.
[51:31.520 --> 51:33.800]  Nick has a sticker on the front of his truck
[51:33.800 --> 51:36.040]  that says, warning harsh driver
[51:36.040 --> 51:37.880]  and that it couldn't be more true.
[51:39.500 --> 51:40.220]  What are you talking about?
[51:42.220 --> 51:44.060]  And luckily, that's the last time you're gonna
[51:44.060 --> 51:45.440]  have to help Nick. Yep.
[51:47.040 --> 51:47.700]  That's it.
[51:49.900 --> 51:52.260]  Thank you. Oh, come on.
[51:52.600 --> 51:54.460]  Come on. Yeah, thanks, Geoff.
[51:54.640 --> 51:55.440]  Alright, no problem, buddy.
[51:56.960 --> 51:58.180]  Now, we can
[51:58.180 --> 51:59.900]  get these beams. We just need to
[51:59.900 --> 52:02.040]  be smart about it. Yeah, I'm gonna get right next to it
[52:02.040 --> 52:04.120]  this time. And, yeah, and I'm gonna
[52:04.880 --> 52:06.520]  I'm gonna put it on the handbrake
[52:06.520 --> 52:07.680]  and flip me over.
[52:10.580 --> 52:12.440]  If you have the, like the
[52:12.440 --> 52:14.180]  anchor braces, yeah, anchor
[52:14.180 --> 52:14.880]  release it.
[52:17.380 --> 52:17.860]  Alright.
[52:18.540 --> 52:19.580]  Buck of me, that's deep.
[52:20.580 --> 52:21.560]  Butts in my ass.
[52:21.560 --> 52:23.760]  I don't know if you can do that, Gavin.
[52:23.860 --> 52:25.300]  You might want to back up.
[52:26.380 --> 52:28.180]  Oh, shit. Oh, you might be
[52:28.180 --> 52:29.060]  Uh-oh.
[52:29.820 --> 52:31.520]  This might be the end of the Gavin adventure.
[52:32.220 --> 52:32.960]  I don't know.
[52:34.940 --> 52:35.760]  Gavin, that is
[52:35.760 --> 52:37.580]  that is so deep.
[52:38.220 --> 52:39.180]  Yeah, but this is a
[52:39.180 --> 52:41.360]  this is a super truck. How?
[52:44.640 --> 52:45.000]  Wow!
[52:45.860 --> 52:47.740]  Gavin, I'm so impressed with you in this truck's episode.
[52:48.160 --> 52:50.400]  I'm winching. Oh, my back's filled up with water.
[52:50.400 --> 52:50.580]  You are, you're doing great, man.
[52:51.080 --> 52:53.920]  Yeah, you're swimming, brother.
[52:54.060 --> 52:55.660]  Nick, stop right there. Stop, stop, stop.
[52:56.340 --> 52:57.380]  You're perfect there.
[52:57.520 --> 52:58.780]  Andrew, you already got yours? Okay.
[52:58.780 --> 53:00.040]  Yep, on my way out.
[53:00.560 --> 53:03.440]  I'm going to load you up here in a second, Nick.
[53:03.480 --> 53:04.140]  Thank you.
[53:04.800 --> 53:06.540]  Gavin, wow. Approach it properly.
[53:06.760 --> 53:08.440]  Winch a little more. Come on, you got it.
[53:10.020 --> 53:10.400]  There you go.
[53:11.180 --> 53:11.680]  There you go.
[53:12.400 --> 53:13.820]  It's a bit of a fuel suck, this one.
[53:13.960 --> 53:15.040]  It is, it's tough.
[53:16.660 --> 53:18.920]  But you're coming all the way. You're almost there.
[53:19.300 --> 53:19.660]  Wow!
[53:21.500 --> 53:22.540]  Incredible play, Gavin.
[53:23.380 --> 53:24.460]  Okay. Oh, that's cool.
[53:24.580 --> 53:25.640]  Should have gone in low gear, I think.
[53:26.400 --> 53:27.760]  Oh, yeah, probably.
[53:28.520 --> 53:30.060]  Well, you have another chance right here.
[53:30.260 --> 53:30.500]  Yep.
[53:31.860 --> 53:33.280]  Pretty impressive to make it through.
[53:34.480 --> 53:34.880]  What'd you say, Nick?
[53:35.220 --> 53:37.880]  I was saying to Gavin that was pretty impressive he made it through.
[53:38.020 --> 53:39.140]  Yeah, that was really great.
[53:41.380 --> 53:42.660]  Nick, are you pivoting on my screen?
[53:43.380 --> 53:43.560]  No.
[53:43.800 --> 53:45.280]  You know he is.
[53:46.320 --> 53:48.780]  Oh, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff.
[53:49.800 --> 53:50.160]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[53:50.160 --> 53:53.660]  This thing is not, this winch is not strong enough for...
[53:54.280 --> 53:55.520]  for this, I'm afraid.
[53:56.320 --> 53:57.740]  Um, Geoff, uh...
[53:58.960 --> 53:59.760]  Geoff took a tumble.
[54:00.320 --> 54:01.320]  Let me... Geoff tumbled.
[54:01.520 --> 54:03.600]  Can you, can you, can you set me right again?
[54:04.020 --> 54:04.520]  He's gonna try.
[54:04.740 --> 54:07.280]  I'm not ready to give up yet, but I just think we're gonna have to...
[54:08.240 --> 54:08.600]  Yeah.
[54:09.820 --> 54:10.540]  There you go. Give it a shot.
[54:11.020 --> 54:11.800]  Okay, you ready? Yeah.
[54:12.580 --> 54:15.080]  Okay, I'm gonna...
[54:15.740 --> 54:16.880]  close function here.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.180]  Go to low gear and...
[54:19.180 --> 54:20.160]  hold on to your butts.
[54:22.480 --> 54:23.300]  There you do it.
[54:23.320 --> 54:24.640]  Keep going. Keep pulling.
[54:24.880 --> 54:26.320]  Hold Y while you're doing it.
[54:26.440 --> 54:27.760]  Doing it. While you go forward.
[54:28.060 --> 54:30.340]  There we go, there we go, that's good. You're gonna flip me over in a second.
[54:30.480 --> 54:31.400]  You're gonna flip me in a second.
[54:31.760 --> 54:33.940]  Keep driving forward, keep driving forward.
[54:34.120 --> 54:35.780]  As soon as I crest this...
[54:35.780 --> 54:38.000]  Andrew, you gotta let them finish what they're doing first.
[54:38.240 --> 54:38.360]  Yep.
[54:39.660 --> 54:40.020]  Yep.
[54:41.660 --> 54:42.020]  Yep.
[54:43.580 --> 54:44.580]  What are you doing, Andrew?
[54:45.820 --> 54:47.020]  Finish what you're doing.
[54:47.020 --> 54:50.040]  Finish what you're doing and then we'll worry about what's next.
[54:50.300 --> 54:50.760]  Here we go, Geoff.
[54:51.120 --> 54:52.540]  Here we go, Geoff. This is it.
[54:52.820 --> 54:54.720]  Here comes the flip.
[54:54.980 --> 54:55.460]  Flippy flop.
[54:57.280 --> 54:58.400]  Any second now, Nick.
[54:59.100 --> 54:59.820]  Any second.
[55:00.980 --> 55:02.380]  Alright. Here's what we're gonna do.
[55:02.560 --> 55:04.600]  Hold on, hold on. I'm going to auto now.
[55:04.920 --> 55:06.260]  Switch to my other truck.
[55:06.640 --> 55:08.100]  Hold on, hold on. I got you, I got you, I got you.
[55:08.680 --> 55:10.060]  I got you, I got you, I got you.
[55:10.180 --> 55:10.800]  I got you.
[55:12.220 --> 55:16.140]  Nick is just dragging Geoff along.
[55:16.140 --> 55:18.220]  Well, first off, let me switch back to this.
[55:20.400 --> 55:21.240]  Restore my crane.
[55:21.780 --> 55:22.220]  Where's Andrew?
[55:23.100 --> 55:24.540]  I'm on the way.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.020]  On the way to what?
[55:27.340 --> 55:29.240]  I'm really close to the drill site.
[55:29.580 --> 55:31.460]  He's really close. It's pretty awesome.
[55:31.760 --> 55:32.840]  Go turn it in.
[55:34.500 --> 55:35.660]  Why don't you finish?
[55:35.820 --> 55:37.520]  Geoff, why don't you finish what you're doing
[55:37.520 --> 55:39.360]  and then we have a little chat.
[55:39.360 --> 55:41.640]  Why don't we all as a group go together
[55:41.640 --> 55:43.420]  and we can do it as a group.
[55:43.420 --> 55:45.880]  We couldn't get the other steel beams.
[55:45.980 --> 55:46.920]  Geoff flipped as a result.
[55:47.260 --> 55:48.360]  Oh, well.
[55:49.580 --> 55:51.780]  Maybe we should all bring this one in
[55:51.780 --> 55:53.940]  and celebrate and we can end the video
[55:53.940 --> 55:55.600]  with one delivery of steel beams.
[55:56.200 --> 55:57.160]  As a group.
[55:58.060 --> 55:58.860]  Geoff, do you need help?
[55:59.980 --> 56:01.280]  I can get myself out.
[56:01.460 --> 56:02.300]  You, uh...
[56:02.300 --> 56:04.340]  You going to go help Andrew?
[56:04.600 --> 56:05.540]  I'm going to go investigate.
[56:06.140 --> 56:07.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you should go investigate.
[56:08.420 --> 56:10.680]  Unite all certain words you can use.
[56:10.680 --> 56:12.380]  There is a car in there. That's pretty cool.
[56:13.320 --> 56:13.700]  Sweet.
[56:15.340 --> 56:16.660]  Are we talking about the lake?
[56:17.240 --> 56:18.280]  Yeah, there's like a car in the lake.
[56:18.660 --> 56:20.440]  And then Gavin is a truck in the lake.
[56:21.040 --> 56:21.760]  I'm in a lake.
[56:22.280 --> 56:24.920]  This is a terrible swamp. I don't know who built this house.
[56:25.780 --> 56:27.080]  This is a terrible swamp.
[56:27.180 --> 56:28.920]  I also question some of the homes
[56:28.920 --> 56:30.000]  that are built in this game.
[56:30.080 --> 56:31.600]  I mean, at least Bungie on stilts or something.
[56:32.140 --> 56:34.520]  Maybe it was before their floodplains were built.
[56:34.800 --> 56:37.020]  That could have been some... Oh, there was a dam built, I guess.
[56:37.300 --> 56:37.640]  Yeah.
[56:38.160 --> 56:39.460]  That could have changed everything.
[56:40.140 --> 56:41.300]  You went right, right?
[56:42.740 --> 56:43.020]  Hmm?
[56:43.500 --> 56:46.180]  Andrew? Did you go to the fork in the road?
[56:46.760 --> 56:47.280]  Uh, yep.
[56:47.860 --> 56:49.140]  Okay. I forked it.
[56:49.680 --> 56:50.240]  Oh, dear.
[56:51.520 --> 56:52.960]  Oh, he found you.
[56:53.160 --> 56:54.380]  Hey, bud.
[56:54.860 --> 56:57.060]  Yeah, so the road is right up ahead.
[56:57.980 --> 56:58.660]  Yeah, it sure is.
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.240]  I don't even know how he did that.
[57:01.400 --> 57:03.680]  I can't help but notice that that's the edge of the road.
[57:04.520 --> 57:04.900]  Uh...
[57:04.900 --> 57:07.720]  You're completely upside down, Andrew.
[57:08.440 --> 57:10.240]  Yeah, like momentum, you know,
[57:10.280 --> 57:11.360]  and physics and all that.
[57:11.500 --> 57:11.860]  Crazy.
[57:12.620 --> 57:12.840]  Yeah.
[57:14.060 --> 57:15.720]  You see what happened to me now?
[57:17.120 --> 57:17.420]  I do.
[57:18.020 --> 57:19.360]  Thank you, Dad.
[57:20.220 --> 57:22.140]  Thank you, Christ.
[57:22.340 --> 57:22.800]  Did you get it?
[57:23.340 --> 57:23.520]  Yeah.
[57:24.720 --> 57:26.580]  Alright, now let's try again.
[57:26.680 --> 57:30.140]  I just don't know that this crane is strong enough for beams,
[57:30.240 --> 57:31.480]  but I definitely want to try.
[57:31.960 --> 57:33.500]  Where's the frickin' road?
[57:34.140 --> 57:35.360]  I don't know what you...
[57:35.360 --> 57:37.700]  You set a weird course, man.
[57:37.800 --> 57:39.280]  I thought this was the road.
[57:39.340 --> 57:39.620]  Here, welcome.
[57:40.740 --> 57:43.540]  There you go. Alright, now how do you get the, uh...
[57:44.360 --> 57:45.580]  How do you get the beams back in there?
[57:46.060 --> 57:46.800]  I got a crane.
[57:47.940 --> 57:49.180]  Oh, that's what... Oh.
[57:49.840 --> 57:51.120]  Can you crane him to me?
[57:51.300 --> 57:52.560]  And then maybe we'll go back and get the other ones?
[57:52.600 --> 57:55.180]  Because Geoff couldn't get him out with the other ones.
[57:55.320 --> 57:57.780]  Yeah, my crane is weak.
[57:57.780 --> 57:59.120]  I think you gotta deliver
[57:59.120 --> 58:00.960]  just maybe these one...
[58:00.960 --> 58:02.240]  this one set of steel beams first.
[58:02.500 --> 58:04.160]  And then you can worry about it.
[58:04.320 --> 58:06.000]  Yeah, maybe you deliver that.
[58:06.380 --> 58:08.760]  I'll follow. Make sure you make it.
[58:09.120 --> 58:10.980]  Actually, maybe I should winch you right now.
[58:11.140 --> 58:11.620]  Oh, boy.
[58:12.800 --> 58:13.680]  Oh, boy.
[58:15.320 --> 58:17.460]  And don't forget, after you put it in there,
[58:17.460 --> 58:18.720]  don't forget to secure the load.
[58:18.800 --> 58:20.700]  There you go. Alright, you're in business.
[58:21.260 --> 58:22.500]  It was dancing on your back.
[58:23.060 --> 58:25.360]  You gotta know when to truck him.
[58:27.680 --> 58:28.640]  No winch!
[58:29.480 --> 58:35.680]  Hey, you think this thing was built
[58:35.680 --> 58:36.680]  for two trucks at once?
[58:36.960 --> 58:38.160]  Andrew, wow!
[58:40.760 --> 58:45.420]  No, no, no. Back over here, Geoff.
[58:46.720 --> 58:47.460]  Oh, baby.
[58:47.820 --> 58:48.600]  I'm just running support.
[58:49.120 --> 58:50.560]  Oh, God.
[58:52.420 --> 58:53.520]  Why would you
[58:53.520 --> 58:53.740]  shortcut?
[58:54.540 --> 58:57.120]  Actually, it's easier to drive on than the muddy road.
[58:58.460 --> 58:59.440]  Oh, Geoff.
[59:00.200 --> 59:01.220]  Until you flip.
[59:01.820 --> 59:03.800]  When you flip, we're delivering this.
[59:04.320 --> 59:04.600]  Let's rotate.
[59:05.160 --> 59:06.960]  Let's get precise with it.
[59:07.720 --> 59:08.680]  Drop that.
[59:09.780 --> 59:11.020]  Geoff's having a magical time.
[59:11.420 --> 59:13.680]  And let's go ahead and pack
[59:13.680 --> 59:14.020]  that cargo.
[59:15.220 --> 59:16.940]  And that cargo is packed.
[59:16.960 --> 59:17.620]  One of two!
[59:20.360 --> 59:21.560]  I don't...
[59:22.900 --> 59:23.720]  I don't know that Geoff
[59:23.720 --> 59:25.020]  needs help. I think Geoff's got it.
[59:25.360 --> 59:26.940]  I'm good. Did you have the steel beams?
[59:27.780 --> 59:28.840]  One of two!
[59:29.940 --> 59:31.140]  Alright, we'll wait here.
[59:31.800 --> 59:32.640]  Or should we do something else?
[59:33.660 --> 59:34.460]  Check him out.
[59:34.840 --> 59:37.120]  We'll come back and see how you're doing.
[59:37.420 --> 59:39.740]  I gotta get turned around and then I don't know where I'm going.
[59:39.960 --> 59:41.040]  So I'll have to figure that out in a second.
[59:43.240 --> 59:44.220]  Well, the good news is
[59:44.220 --> 59:45.120]  you're real close.
[59:47.780 --> 59:49.560]  We made it really far before we
[59:49.560 --> 59:50.420]  messed everything up.
[59:52.660 --> 59:55.200]  We're gonna finish
[59:55.200 --> 59:57.940]  this segment of Not a Drill.
[59:58.100 --> 59:59.440]  The road is
[59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.520]  more road looking on the map than it is
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.080]  in real life.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.620]  Gavin's been in
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.580]  a swamp and in water for
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.600]  the last 15 minutes.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.780]  Does the water level
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.320]  change with rain in the game or no?
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.320]  I don't think so.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.580]  It was rain earlier. I was wondering
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.340]  if that was the case.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.020]  I'm looking for Geoff.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.680]  I've blown about 150
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.980]  liters in this swamp, I think.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.960]  Don't worry about it, I'm paying for it.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.000]  Oh, there he is.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.360]  Let me get out of your way.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.800]  Just keep on going straight.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.320]  Go, big fella!
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.820]  That was fun trying to figure out
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.560]  those metal beams and my weak ass
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.280]  little patch right here.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.400]  Nice job. I look forward to
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:46.920]  seeing the edit.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.500]  I just had to...
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.400]  I just took some finessing.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.140]  We've got a whole convoy going. Convay? Jesus.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:54.780]  Convoy?
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.260]  How do you convey this convoy?
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.260]  Convay.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.420]  Convay.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.400]  Sending messages through the night.
[01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:09.490]  I never did the thing I was originally doing
[01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.430]  with the high saddle, I guess.
[01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:13.330]  Alright.
[01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:15.410]  Getting close, it looks like.
[01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.010]  There's this little bridge to cross.
[01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:23.270]  Yup, and there's nothing that can go wrong for you
[01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:25.050]  between where you're at and that bridge, don't worry.
[01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:27.110]  Yeah, don't ask anyone else about it either.
[01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:28.250]  Alright.
[01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.530]  Everything that you guys have just said
[01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:32.150]  at face value.
[01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.650]  Nice little wide turn.
[01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:37.410]  Yeah, I don't know why
[01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:39.090]  you'd listen to these fucking guys.
[01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:39.630]  It's...
[01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.150]  They're in a line
[01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:45.210]  with you in this thing, and that's
[01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:47.150]  the thing that makes me the most nervous about this
[01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.850]  delivery. What are you talking about?
[01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:51.290]  Near you. It's baby ducks following
[01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.150]  mama duck. Yeah, I know. I don't trust
[01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:54.290]  these fucking baby ducks.
[01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.890]  Woah!
[01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.990]  Woah! There goes Andrew.
[01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:03.250]  Baby duck. This is what I'm talking about.
[01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:03.790]  Baby duck down.
[01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:06.570]  Mama duck, you just go.
[01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:07.570]  You go, mama duck.
[01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:10.310]  Go deliver it. I got him.
[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.910]  These fucking idiot ducks.
[01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.330]  What do you mean?
[01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:16.570]  I'm gonna help him.
[01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:18.890]  Dumbass ducks.
[01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:20.450]  Stupid ass ducks.
[01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:22.210]  These are some unmighty ducks.
[01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:24.910]  Water damages
[01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:26.550]  the truck. Well, no shit,
[01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:26.950]  Sherlock.
[01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:29.750]  Yeah, that's right. Tell him, Nick.
[01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:32.270]  Can I help?
[01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:34.610]  Why did the
[01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:35.970]  winch get disconnected?
[01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:38.370]  Oh, you're backing into the water.
[01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:39.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.870]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.310]  Having some engine problems.
[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.370]  Sunset's beautiful, though.
[01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:50.310]  Sunset's gorgeous.
[01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.310]  How you doing over there, Gavin? Just climbing hills.
[01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:53.170]  Oh, wow, that's pretty.
[01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:55.610]  That's the second sunset of the day.
[01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.870]  Yeah!
[01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:00.470]  Alright, you're still there.
[01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.830]  Way to go, boys. Now we gotta do the oil rig
[01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.050]  Oh, that'll be next time on Trucks.
[01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:07.390]  Next time on Trucks.
[01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:09.090]  Everybody's
[01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.130]  favorite new television show, Trucks.
[01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.230]  Thank you for watching
[01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:14.510]  another regulation
[01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:16.830]  gameplay. Boy, we hope you
[01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:18.930]  enjoyed it. If you like Trucks
[01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.990]  and you like watching us play Trucks, we've done it a few times
[01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:23.050]  in the past. I gotta say, this is the only time it's worked.
[01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:24.830]  So maybe don't watch those other videos.
[01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.030]  Just watch this one.
[01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:29.010]  And because it worked, I think
[01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:30.990]  this means I'm gonna force these idiots to play Trucks
[01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.070]  a lot. So look forward to more Trucks
[01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.130]  on the regulation gameplay. And if that's
[01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:36.790]  not enough, and it should not be,
[01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:39.070]  listen to the regulation podcast because it's
[01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:40.990]  exactly like this without all this visual
[01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:43.130]  truck nonsense. Way better
[01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:44.990]  in my opinion. Available anywhere
[01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:46.670]  podcasts are available.
[01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:48.590]  And, uh... Mama duck!
[01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.950]  Spay and neuter your pets.
[01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:52.790]  Bye! Bye!
[01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:53.810]  Mama no!
