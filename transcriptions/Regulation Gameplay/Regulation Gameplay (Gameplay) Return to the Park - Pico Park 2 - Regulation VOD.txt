[00:01.400 --> 00:02.300]  We're rolling!
[00:04.520 --> 00:06.620]  He was so loud. He was too banger.
[00:07.400 --> 00:13.320]  Andrew, you banged so hard you got cut off. Yeah, I cut myself off. Well, too much bang.
[00:13.600 --> 00:16.000]  In Discord, it was so loud we couldn't hear it.
[00:18.820 --> 00:21.020]  We're here playing Peacock Park 2.
[00:21.680 --> 00:22.460]  We're rolling.
[00:23.800 --> 00:28.940]  That's what the the hype guy for the UFC's, I don't remember his name, the babysitter to the stars.
[00:28.940 --> 00:33.300]  He would say we're rolling? Yeah, that was his whole thing. He'd yell, we're rolling!
[00:34.580 --> 00:38.300]  Oh. And everyone get excited. He was great. Burt Watson. What was he taking? I believe.
[00:38.860 --> 00:44.080]  I don't know. He was rolling. Emma Watson? He was a Watson. Yeah, I think it was Burt Watson.
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.680]  He's great. Anyway, Peacock Park 2. We're playing it. Right fucking awesome. Right before we started playing this,
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.100]  I finished up a documentary I was watching with Emily about the Zodiac Killer on Netflix.
[00:54.860 --> 00:57.860]  If one of you guys is a serial killer,
[00:57.860 --> 01:01.960]  would you let me know before your deathbed, please? Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:02.300 --> 01:05.160]  No, it would be on my deathbed, you would know.
[01:05.380 --> 01:11.200]  I'd rather just find out ahead of time. I would become one on my deathbed. I would say, everybody huddle in, and then a knife.
[01:11.760 --> 01:13.220]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[01:13.600 --> 01:14.580]  That would be awesome.
[01:14.860 --> 01:17.500]  This serial killer only comes on his deathbed.
[01:17.800 --> 01:18.880]  That was such a good idea.
[01:19.300 --> 01:19.940]  That rocks.
[01:20.640 --> 01:21.960]  I think that's awesome.
[01:22.480 --> 01:26.180]  I was gonna say, I was gonna lean over and say, hey, thanks for the beanhole.
[01:26.180 --> 01:27.360]  That would help me out a lot.
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.940]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.080]  That's pretty good.
[01:32.220 --> 01:37.580]  If one dying guy said, huddle in, to like five people all at once, I'd be so suspicious.
[01:38.640 --> 01:40.580]  It just slits all our throats.
[01:41.260 --> 01:42.140]  I think that's awesome.
[01:42.140 --> 01:43.780]  Because most likely it'd be a fart, right?
[01:44.440 --> 01:45.720]  Hey, Billy's Piss Rats.
[01:46.220 --> 01:47.460]  Thanks to Regulation Rat.
[01:47.900 --> 01:49.440]  That'd be such a great long play.
[01:50.620 --> 01:52.380]  That's a Geoff play if I've ever heard one.
[01:52.460 --> 01:52.980]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:53.880 --> 01:54.320]  Dude.
[01:54.800 --> 01:56.120]  Well, guys, it's Friday.
[01:57.260 --> 01:59.680]  We gotta work on towards 5.01.
[02:00.100 --> 02:02.240]  Which is the best time of the week.
[02:02.400 --> 02:04.080]  But we gotta do it in Pico Park 2.
[02:04.200 --> 02:05.680]  Where we left off last time.
[02:06.100 --> 02:07.260]  Don't worry about it.
[02:07.520 --> 02:09.160]  Just know that we did play it once before.
[02:09.360 --> 02:11.360]  You can watch it on our Regulation Gameplay Channel.
[02:11.580 --> 02:12.160]  And look at that.
[02:12.560 --> 02:14.500]  Yeah, see, look at that.
[02:14.800 --> 02:15.780]  Oh, no.
[02:16.420 --> 02:17.840]  I recognize that line.
[02:18.020 --> 02:21.580]  This is not a good way to start, boys.
[02:21.580 --> 02:21.900]  What?
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.300]  24 levels?
[02:27.060 --> 02:29.040]  This is gonna be easy. Let's go.
[02:29.520 --> 02:30.180]  I'm blue.
[02:31.260 --> 02:33.080]  We're gonna have to work together.
[02:33.780 --> 02:34.340]  Oh, no.
[02:34.860 --> 02:36.660]  We need three on this one.
[02:37.060 --> 02:38.600]  We need three on both of them, it looks like.
[02:39.040 --> 02:41.340]  I think we're gonna have to start...
[02:41.340 --> 02:43.820]  Oh, wow. You're not gonna be able to get up on anything.
[02:44.480 --> 02:45.220]  Alright, I'm on.
[02:46.900 --> 02:47.640]  Here I come.
[02:47.740 --> 02:48.440]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[02:48.440 --> 02:50.440]  Should we do one side at a time?
[02:50.720 --> 02:51.280]  God damn it.
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.320]  I think we start with the right.
[02:54.220 --> 02:55.700]  Yeah, okay. Eric, get those.
[02:56.400 --> 02:57.260]  Just bounce back.
[02:57.800 --> 02:59.940]  Got that.
[03:00.380 --> 03:01.340]  And then I can help on the right?
[03:01.680 --> 03:02.480]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:03.400 --> 03:04.340]  Nick, are you blue?
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.040]  I'm purple.
[03:06.960 --> 03:08.040]  Let's help each other, Eric.
[03:08.500 --> 03:09.140]  That's awesome.
[03:09.360 --> 03:12.380]  We just gotta do it faster.
[03:13.580 --> 03:14.520]  No, we got it.
[03:16.060 --> 03:17.140]  It's leading time.
[03:19.140 --> 03:20.360]  We almost did it.
[03:20.420 --> 03:22.840]  Let's work on the left side.
[03:22.940 --> 03:23.460]  And then we'll go to the right.
[03:23.960 --> 03:26.380]  Also, because we're not looking at the...
[03:27.360 --> 03:28.960]  What the name plates say.
[03:29.240 --> 03:30.120]  Andrew is red.
[03:30.220 --> 03:31.960]  I'm purple. Eric is green.
[03:32.100 --> 03:33.680]  Geoff is orange. And Gavin is blue.
[03:33.680 --> 03:34.420]  Oh, we missed one.
[03:36.260 --> 03:38.160]  Me and orange are gonna go to the bottom.
[03:38.380 --> 03:39.700]  Blue, you go to the right.
[03:40.240 --> 03:41.360]  Come on, orange.
[03:42.000 --> 03:42.540]  I'm coming.
[03:42.740 --> 03:43.960]  I just gotta get off this fucking thing.
[03:44.180 --> 03:44.480]  Ready?
[03:47.120 --> 03:47.720]  Got it.
[03:49.080 --> 03:50.260]  They're gonna get it. Let's go up.
[03:53.900 --> 03:55.940]  You guys have to get out of there.
[03:56.180 --> 03:57.880]  You guys have to get out of there.
[03:58.360 --> 03:59.000]  You get out of there.
[03:59.180 --> 04:00.160]  Oh, there we go. Nice.
[04:00.500 --> 04:02.280]  We didn't have to get out of there at all.
[04:04.020 --> 04:04.500]  Still met.
[04:05.380 --> 04:06.960]  Guys, thanks for watching Pico Part 2.
[04:07.060 --> 04:08.940]  We're really excited to be playing this with you today.
[04:08.940 --> 04:10.260]  Are you excited to see it?
[04:10.360 --> 04:12.220]  We'll see you in just a second. Let's go to the next level.
[04:12.640 --> 04:14.660]  That would have pissed me off so bad.
[04:15.960 --> 04:17.460]  Nick, I had plenty of time.
[04:18.060 --> 04:18.620]  Oh, God.
[04:19.980 --> 04:21.040]  Are you my son?
[04:25.580 --> 04:28.040]  What's this challenge going to be?
[04:29.540 --> 04:30.240]  Oh, my God.
[04:30.440 --> 04:32.640]  Five. That's us.
[04:33.140 --> 04:33.800]  We're five.
[04:34.500 --> 04:35.020]  Where are we going?
[04:35.020 --> 04:35.760]  I don't know.
[04:36.820 --> 04:37.900]  Keep going.
[04:38.080 --> 04:38.840]  Nobody jump.
[04:40.460 --> 04:41.540]  Hang on.
[04:42.800 --> 04:43.720]  Okay, let's go.
[04:44.240 --> 04:44.480]  No!
[04:45.920 --> 04:47.620]  Wow, that's not a lot of time.
[04:49.480 --> 04:50.560]  Start working.
[04:52.420 --> 04:54.620]  I'm gonna jump and make my way over
[04:54.620 --> 04:56.000]  and move the thing.
[04:56.160 --> 04:57.440]  Everyone can just come in behind me.
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.040]  Go now.
[04:59.040 --> 05:00.100]  Okay.
[05:02.560 --> 05:04.600]  Oh, there's no key.
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.060]  What about the key?
[05:06.600 --> 05:09.500]  We gotta go left?
[05:10.180 --> 05:10.800]  I guess so.
[05:11.000 --> 05:11.420]  Do we?
[05:12.200 --> 05:13.600]  Is there enough time?
[05:15.020 --> 05:16.680]  Oh, my God.
[05:17.200 --> 05:18.580]  It's a time button.
[05:19.160 --> 05:20.220]  Oh, no.
[05:22.620 --> 05:23.640]  Jump up.
[05:24.140 --> 05:28.600]  Orange, orange, orange.
[05:28.600 --> 05:30.000]  Orange, orange.
[05:30.400 --> 05:32.200]  Orange, orange.
[05:33.080 --> 05:33.540]  Orange.
[05:34.840 --> 05:36.720]  I'm trying to help everybody get up.
[05:36.740 --> 05:37.160]  You did.
[05:39.380 --> 05:39.560]  What?
[05:39.980 --> 05:42.340]  What am I supposed to do with this?
[05:43.160 --> 05:44.120]  Use it to climb up.
[05:45.060 --> 05:46.580]  Use it to climb up.
[05:46.580 --> 05:47.760]  But we need two people.
[05:49.380 --> 05:50.000]  No, you don't.
[05:50.280 --> 05:51.740]  Yes, we use it.
[05:51.840 --> 05:52.260]  No, stop.
[05:52.600 --> 05:53.160]  Get up there.
[05:53.160 --> 05:54.480]  Get up there.
[05:54.800 --> 05:55.140]  Push me.
[05:56.420 --> 05:57.840]  Get the key.
[05:58.060 --> 05:58.760]  Get on me.
[06:01.740 --> 06:03.160]  This went badly.
[06:04.120 --> 06:04.720]  We're alright.
[06:06.700 --> 06:07.580]  Jump up and go.
[06:08.480 --> 06:11.220]  Well, you pushed me.
[06:11.420 --> 06:11.940]  Are you?
[06:13.840 --> 06:15.720]  Push with your legs.
[06:15.940 --> 06:17.500]  Are you the dumbest man alive?
[06:17.600 --> 06:19.240]  Push with them legs.
[06:20.000 --> 06:20.660]  Is this a bit?
[06:20.660 --> 06:23.180]  Are you the dumbest man alive?
[06:23.380 --> 06:24.020]  We didn't have time.
[06:25.480 --> 06:26.620]  Orange, red, go up.
[06:27.240 --> 06:28.300]  Alright, we'll do two.
[06:28.380 --> 06:29.260]  Blue with me.
[06:31.000 --> 06:31.360]  Coming.
[06:33.160 --> 06:33.500]  Hey, orange.
[06:34.160 --> 06:34.960]  Orange, please.
[06:42.540 --> 06:43.480]  Jump on me.
[06:44.240 --> 06:44.600]  There you go.
[06:45.380 --> 06:48.360]  Oh, I see. I hadn't done that yet.
[06:48.920 --> 06:49.820]  We'll have to go again.
[06:52.220 --> 06:53.420]  It was on the lower levels.
[06:54.100 --> 06:57.840]  We can get a fourth person up there.
[06:59.640 --> 07:00.760]  No, I don't think so.
[07:00.820 --> 07:01.580]  No, I don't think so.
[07:01.740 --> 07:03.400]  I don't think we can do it. Maybe we restart.
[07:04.200 --> 07:05.180]  No, we can't on this one.
[07:05.280 --> 07:08.280]  We don't necessarily have to use that block.
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.600]  You don't have to do anything with that block.
[07:11.760 --> 07:12.340]  You just jump it.
[07:12.420 --> 07:14.120]  You don't have to move it.
[07:14.780 --> 07:17.800]  I think you need to drop it so the second person can jump up there.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.640]  We can just get more people up there.
[07:19.640 --> 07:20.580]  We don't need it.
[07:21.860 --> 07:22.560]  There we go.
[07:23.180 --> 07:24.160]  Purple, get out of the way.
[07:26.100 --> 07:27.320]  Both jump on my head.
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.160]  There you go.
[07:29.620 --> 07:30.820]  Purple on top.
[07:32.280 --> 07:32.900]  There you go.
[07:33.540 --> 07:34.480]  I got you. Me and you.
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.680]  I got it. I'm coming up.
[07:40.260 --> 07:41.140]  Okay, everyone...
[07:41.140 --> 07:42.360]  Let me get up here.
[07:43.320 --> 07:45.100]  We have so much time.
[07:45.440 --> 07:46.900]  Okay, so you guys line up.
[07:46.900 --> 07:49.480]  I'm gonna jump on top and push.
[07:50.080 --> 07:50.740]  Here I come.
[07:51.520 --> 07:52.420]  Okay, let's go.
[07:53.420 --> 07:55.020]  We have so much time for this baby level.
[07:55.320 --> 07:56.680]  Yeah, we're pushing it all the way to the wall.
[07:56.820 --> 07:57.860]  Don't stop until we hit the wall.
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.340]  We're just gonna go straight to the wall.
[08:00.580 --> 08:01.460]  Who stopped?
[08:01.940 --> 08:02.860]  Somebody did stop.
[08:04.100 --> 08:05.220]  Andrew needs to get up.
[08:06.260 --> 08:08.740]  That's what the one block is for.
[08:09.180 --> 08:11.220]  Yeah, we're gonna need that one block.
[08:11.800 --> 08:14.100]  I'm still leaving, so it just looks like Andrew's the runner.
[08:14.100 --> 08:16.200]  Andrew fucking blew it.
[08:18.880 --> 08:20.100]  Are you okay, Andrew?
[08:22.940 --> 08:23.820]  Andrew's muted.
[08:24.900 --> 08:25.160]  Oh.
[08:26.200 --> 08:26.580]  I was dead.
[08:32.220 --> 08:34.800]  Okay, we're gonna jump on purple.
[08:34.800 --> 08:35.240]  Jump on me.
[08:35.580 --> 08:36.020]  There you go.
[08:38.500 --> 08:39.820]  Come push me.
[08:40.160 --> 08:41.900]  Come blue. Anybody. Come on, Christ.
[08:42.360 --> 08:43.460]  We got time.
[08:43.460 --> 08:45.200]  I'm just waiting to get Erica.
[08:45.560 --> 08:47.020]  I need one person up here.
[08:47.100 --> 08:48.540]  Somebody else push the block out.
[08:49.240 --> 08:50.880]  Oh, you morons.
[08:51.560 --> 08:53.060]  Why did you leave?
[08:53.940 --> 08:55.040]  Alright, chill out.
[08:55.600 --> 08:56.480]  Get out from that.
[08:57.660 --> 08:57.840]  Okay.
[08:58.680 --> 08:59.820]  And then how do we get it?
[09:00.240 --> 09:01.040]  All the time in the world.
[09:01.380 --> 09:04.800]  Okay, so the key's up here.
[09:05.300 --> 09:06.660]  Alright, all the time in the world, guys.
[09:07.080 --> 09:08.240]  Hey, guys.
[09:08.620 --> 09:09.600]  All the time in the world.
[09:09.600 --> 09:10.540]  God.
[09:11.040 --> 09:12.680]  If I put the O by the 2,
[09:12.800 --> 09:14.120]  maybe we'll get 20 new seconds.
[09:14.960 --> 09:17.760]  Gav, I'm adding that to our gear's deaths.
[09:17.920 --> 09:18.360]  That's you.
[09:21.500 --> 09:24.040]  That was a real fucking rabbit move
[09:24.040 --> 09:24.740]  right there, buddy.
[09:25.540 --> 09:27.100]  Not an intentional rabbit move.
[09:28.480 --> 09:28.960]  No?
[09:29.460 --> 09:31.060]  I didn't call it a weasel move.
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.040]  I called it a rabbit move.
[09:34.600 --> 09:35.360]  Go for it.
[09:36.080 --> 09:36.720]  I'm stuck.
[09:36.720 --> 09:38.040]  Go up above me if you can, Geoff.
[09:38.220 --> 09:38.600]  Oh, sorry.
[09:39.500 --> 09:39.860]  Gavin!
[09:42.820 --> 09:43.880]  Does anybody want to come over?
[09:44.300 --> 09:45.200]  Gavin, are you okay?
[09:45.600 --> 09:47.320]  He's gotta get up there, hasn't he? What do you mean?
[09:47.420 --> 09:48.740]  Why does everyone keep saying that?
[09:50.740 --> 09:51.440]  There you go.
[09:52.440 --> 09:54.400]  Get the key. Okay, now push the block
[09:54.400 --> 09:55.020]  all the way up.
[09:55.860 --> 09:58.160]  I think he needs to drop onto his head.
[09:58.740 --> 10:00.240]  There you go.
[10:01.260 --> 10:01.800]  There you go.
[10:02.820 --> 10:03.720]  Alright, we're all pushing.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.300]  Gavin, you need to be on top
[10:07.300 --> 10:08.980]  and... well, you're fine.
[10:09.040 --> 10:09.880]  I've got a block on my head.
[10:10.300 --> 10:10.880]  It's okay.
[10:11.360 --> 10:12.480]  Go until it hits the wall.
[10:14.100 --> 10:14.940]  Now go, Gavin.
[10:16.820 --> 10:17.560]  There we go.
[10:19.160 --> 10:19.480]  Go!
[10:20.320 --> 10:21.500]  Key man, please!
[10:21.580 --> 10:22.360]  Get out of the way, Gavin.
[10:23.420 --> 10:24.400]  What do you mean, get out of the way?
[10:24.660 --> 10:26.620]  You were standing in the way of the block!
[10:27.560 --> 10:29.740]  What do you mean,
[10:29.880 --> 10:30.540]  what do you mean?
[10:30.540 --> 10:32.840]  I can't get over there, what are you talking about?
[10:33.120 --> 10:34.700]  Just, fuck it, everyone's
[10:34.700 --> 10:36.460]  going, you're just standing there.
[10:37.180 --> 10:38.060]  Motoking97 says,
[10:38.240 --> 10:40.080]  Gavin's gonna give me a stroke.
[10:40.280 --> 10:42.380]  Oh, how do we suck each other up?
[10:42.960 --> 10:44.260]  What? Oh, shit.
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.920]  Sorry. You got suckers, dawg.
[10:46.020 --> 10:48.000]  Andrew wasn't playing. I just fell.
[10:48.120 --> 10:49.080]  I just fell to the side.
[10:51.980 --> 10:52.420]  I'm...
[10:52.420 --> 10:53.460]  Go up, go up!
[10:54.680 --> 10:56.540]  I'm not quite sure...
[10:58.160 --> 10:59.540]  No, you gotta...
[11:00.280 --> 11:01.640]  We should probably start up and come down.
[11:01.640 --> 11:02.980]  Jump up in the air, Purple, and I'll pull you.
[11:03.260 --> 11:05.560]  Oh, thank you. Someone needs to come up the top with me.
[11:06.340 --> 11:06.700]  Cool.
[11:06.920 --> 11:09.020]  Well, hang on, hang on. Andrew.
[11:09.900 --> 11:10.800]  Suck him up, Gavin.
[11:11.640 --> 11:13.040]  Jump on me and then get those.
[11:13.360 --> 11:15.220]  I think that's the way to do this.
[11:15.700 --> 11:17.220]  Keep going, keep going.
[11:19.940 --> 11:21.460]  Okay, Orange, can you get us up?
[11:21.480 --> 11:23.340]  I can't, I can't. I'm stuck.
[11:23.980 --> 11:25.240]  There we go, there we go.
[11:25.240 --> 11:26.640]  Thank you. Can you get Orange?
[11:27.260 --> 11:29.540]  We're like a freaking oil machine.
[11:29.720 --> 11:30.300]  There you go.
[11:30.340 --> 11:33.180]  There you go, on top.
[11:33.660 --> 11:34.340]  Get on me.
[11:34.460 --> 11:36.220]  I don't know if we can make it that far.
[11:37.220 --> 11:39.140]  Orange, jump. Oh, boy.
[11:40.360 --> 11:41.320]  Eric, stop.
[11:42.040 --> 11:43.280]  We gotta go right.
[11:43.300 --> 11:44.220]  Somebody's gotta pull me.
[11:44.680 --> 11:46.620]  We're gonna have to start over.
[11:46.880 --> 11:49.580]  I think we're gonna have to stick together
[11:50.160 --> 11:54.400]  because we can't go all the way left and all the way right.
[11:55.220 --> 11:56.800]  Okay, Gavin and I will stick to the top.
[11:57.140 --> 11:58.040]  Yeah, we have the top.
[11:58.840 --> 12:00.060]  Stop sucking my ass.
[12:00.320 --> 12:00.880]  There you go.
[12:01.420 --> 12:03.660]  You want to use me to jump? Okay.
[12:04.160 --> 12:05.280]  There we go.
[12:06.200 --> 12:07.120]  Jump on each other.
[12:09.040 --> 12:10.640]  Andrew, I'm gonna drop you down there.
[12:10.960 --> 12:12.480]  If he wants to get on me.
[12:13.400 --> 12:13.480]  Alright.
[12:14.160 --> 12:16.660]  Then are we gonna have to mail each other through the slots?
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.220]  Yeah, I think so.
[12:20.420 --> 12:21.460]  And then get red.
[12:22.160 --> 12:23.180]  I'm gonna go down here.
[12:23.620 --> 12:23.980]  Oops.
[12:29.460 --> 12:30.560]  And then get me.
[12:30.840 --> 12:31.600]  Thank you.
[12:32.200 --> 12:33.360]  Okay, let's do the same thing.
[12:33.640 --> 12:34.880]  Geoff, me and you down here.
[12:36.660 --> 12:37.020]  Good.
[12:39.800 --> 12:41.200]  And then we have to get in a suck stack.
[12:41.640 --> 12:43.600]  Yeah, where's the key?
[12:43.700 --> 12:44.100]  There it is.
[12:45.900 --> 12:46.780]  There we go.
[12:47.120 --> 12:48.660]  Somebody come up here and get me.
[12:48.660 --> 12:49.540]  Suck me up, please.
[12:49.780 --> 12:51.140]  I got you, Nick.
[12:52.420 --> 12:53.580]  Jump up there.
[12:55.140 --> 12:56.100]  Geoff, turn around.
[12:57.060 --> 12:57.460]  I'm sucking.
[12:58.440 --> 13:00.740]  Hang on, hang on.
[13:00.740 --> 13:01.280]  Uh-oh.
[13:01.660 --> 13:03.440]  Go, go, go, go!
[13:04.960 --> 13:05.520]  Yeah!
[13:06.420 --> 13:07.540]  Baby star!
[13:08.760 --> 13:09.800]  Andrew, are you okay?
[13:10.280 --> 13:10.760]  I'm great.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.980]  People are saying, can we hear Andrew?
[13:14.120 --> 13:15.160]  He's not talking.
[13:15.160 --> 13:16.440]  I'm doing great.
[13:16.620 --> 13:17.660]  He's locked in.
[13:17.920 --> 13:19.700]  I was focused in, I had nothing to do.
[13:20.320 --> 13:21.220]  Oh, no!
[13:21.560 --> 13:22.460]  It's this one.
[13:24.880 --> 13:27.140]  I've got everyone, let's go!
[13:28.100 --> 13:29.000]  Way to go, next shot.
[13:29.240 --> 13:29.960]  You got it?
[13:30.360 --> 13:30.760]  Yeah!
[13:33.840 --> 13:34.920]  Somebody shoot blue.
[13:35.100 --> 13:35.260]  Oh, right.
[13:36.140 --> 13:37.860]  Well, we have to get everybody else out of the holes.
[13:38.660 --> 13:38.880]  Stop.
[13:39.960 --> 13:40.700]  I'll shoot him.
[13:40.700 --> 13:41.180]  There you go.
[13:42.940 --> 13:43.360]  Alright.
[13:44.440 --> 13:45.700]  I'm going to send you through, Gavin.
[13:47.100 --> 13:47.900]  There I am!
[13:48.480 --> 13:49.020]  Oh, no!
[13:50.460 --> 13:51.540]  You're going to have to shoot him through.
[13:51.900 --> 13:54.320]  Alright, here we go.
[13:55.460 --> 13:55.880]  Watch out.
[13:56.020 --> 13:57.280]  There you go.
[13:58.300 --> 13:58.720]  Nope.
[14:01.320 --> 14:01.740]  Nope.
[14:02.240 --> 14:02.500]  Almost.
[14:05.300 --> 14:07.200]  If red can shoot someone through,
[14:08.020 --> 14:08.920]  it's going to make it a lot...
[14:08.920 --> 14:09.380]  Almost.
[14:11.120 --> 14:12.400]  There you go.
[14:12.520 --> 14:13.700]  And now it's easier to shoot red.
[14:16.120 --> 14:16.680]  Okay.
[14:16.920 --> 14:17.700]  So, stop jumping.
[14:18.140 --> 14:18.580]  Thank you.
[14:21.260 --> 14:22.440]  Oh, my God!
[14:22.980 --> 14:23.260]  What?
[14:24.160 --> 14:25.160]  I got this.
[14:26.260 --> 14:26.700]  Okay.
[14:28.800 --> 14:29.260]  Shit!
[14:41.400 --> 14:42.520]  Who's got me?
[14:43.340 --> 14:43.640]  Oh!
[14:44.020 --> 14:44.660]  Oh!
[14:45.040 --> 14:47.280]  Oh, I'm in green.
[14:47.800 --> 14:48.640]  I'm out.
[14:50.560 --> 14:52.740]  We should all get sucked up there.
[14:53.380 --> 14:54.020]  Whatever.
[14:54.380 --> 14:55.820]  Everyone needs to get sucked up.
[14:56.400 --> 14:56.740]  Hey!
[14:56.740 --> 14:57.620]  There we go.
[14:57.640 --> 15:00.100]  Hey, what's up, audience? Good to see everybody.
[15:00.200 --> 15:02.360]  Thanks for tuning in on Friday.
[15:02.660 --> 15:03.320]  The best time...
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.080]  The best time of the week.
[15:07.080 --> 15:08.300]  Get off him, Gavin!
[15:08.600 --> 15:09.300]  Get off me!
[15:10.220 --> 15:10.880]  There you go.
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.240]  Do you want to stand on me to pull the...
[15:15.240 --> 15:15.620]  There you go.
[15:16.540 --> 15:17.800]  It's just morons.
[15:18.120 --> 15:18.620]  There we go.
[15:22.640 --> 15:23.380]  There you go.
[15:23.380 --> 15:25.360]  Nice. Thank you so much.
[15:25.620 --> 15:26.500]  Yeah, no problem.
[15:27.080 --> 15:27.880]  Being sarcastic.
[15:29.300 --> 15:31.740]  Oh, I made it.
[15:31.760 --> 15:32.680]  Get out of the way.
[15:32.980 --> 15:33.820]  Thank you.
[15:35.820 --> 15:37.100]  Hang on, Gavin. Don't shoot.
[15:38.240 --> 15:39.640]  God damn it!
[15:42.940 --> 15:43.880]  Help me, thank you.
[15:44.920 --> 15:47.420]  Blue, get me. Orange, get blue.
[15:47.720 --> 15:48.980]  Okay, so that didn't...
[15:48.980 --> 15:50.520]  Immediately, never mind.
[15:56.140 --> 15:56.980]  God damn...
[15:59.940 --> 16:00.800]  Red, get orange.
[16:01.260 --> 16:02.520]  Yeah, now red, get orange.
[16:02.740 --> 16:03.240]  Red, get orange.
[16:04.380 --> 16:05.800]  Now blue, get red.
[16:06.820 --> 16:07.320]  Now, yeah.
[16:09.160 --> 16:10.000]  Time it.
[16:10.560 --> 16:11.840]  No, don't shoot from there.
[16:11.940 --> 16:13.420]  Shoot from so close that we can't come out.
[16:13.720 --> 16:14.800]  That's actually a really good idea.
[16:15.400 --> 16:16.280]  Blue, go left.
[16:16.280 --> 16:17.500]  What are you doing? Holy...
[16:18.120 --> 16:18.980]  Why would you...
[16:18.980 --> 16:21.080]  Why would you shoot that way?
[16:21.540 --> 16:23.360]  I forgot that I had orange.
[16:25.860 --> 16:27.460]  Why did you...
[16:27.460 --> 16:28.420]  We weren't doing anything.
[16:28.900 --> 16:31.900]  We had five seconds, Nick.
[16:32.760 --> 16:34.280]  What are you talking about?
[16:34.660 --> 16:35.480]  Plenty of time.
[16:36.520 --> 16:37.120]  Thank you.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.220]  Somebody get blue.
[16:42.020 --> 16:42.640]  Somebody hop on.
[16:42.640 --> 16:44.160]  Okay, I got it.
[16:44.160 --> 16:45.420]  Fuck, it's about right.
[16:48.500 --> 16:49.760]  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[16:50.040 --> 16:51.700]  Oh, Jesus. Great shot.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.140]  Here, get on me.
[16:53.420 --> 16:53.780]  Why?
[16:55.700 --> 16:57.160]  Okay, here, shoot me.
[16:58.600 --> 16:59.200]  Thank you.
[17:00.040 --> 17:01.900]  And then purple, get blue.
[17:02.200 --> 17:03.300]  That's it. There you go.
[17:04.600 --> 17:05.160]  Yes!
[17:05.460 --> 17:06.000]  Phenomenal.
[17:06.480 --> 17:10.900]  Okay, so now we need someone to get purple.
[17:10.900 --> 17:11.360]  Yes!
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.140]  Earlier and you got it.
[17:15.200 --> 17:16.300]  Go, go, go.
[17:16.760 --> 17:17.740]  Holy shit.
[17:18.440 --> 17:21.380]  We had 45 seconds left.
[17:21.480 --> 17:22.220]  Are you kidding me?
[17:22.560 --> 17:23.540]  Wow, what teamwork.
[17:24.260 --> 17:25.900]  That might be a world record.
[17:27.080 --> 17:28.620]  Honestly, that was pretty incredible.
[17:28.920 --> 17:30.060]  Pika Park done quickly.
[17:31.000 --> 17:31.560]  What was the achievement?
[17:33.000 --> 17:33.860]  Do level five.
[17:35.040 --> 17:36.400]  Oh, shit, just like that.
[17:36.620 --> 17:37.360]  Let's do it, boys.
[17:39.420 --> 17:40.200]  Oh, God.
[17:41.320 --> 17:43.400]  Thank you to everyone watching
[17:44.580 --> 17:46.400]  and coming through on a Friday.
[17:46.460 --> 17:47.540]  Oh, God, am I dead?
[17:48.260 --> 17:50.040]  No, no, you just...
[17:50.040 --> 17:51.840]  Ah, you shot, it's friendly fire.
[17:52.080 --> 17:52.780]  Yeah, so there is friendly...
[17:52.780 --> 17:54.460]  That's what I was testing to see if there's friendly fire.
[17:54.540 --> 17:55.500]  Hey, thanks for doing that, man.
[17:55.580 --> 17:56.360]  Well, yeah, I was testing.
[17:56.380 --> 17:59.120]  So everyone just kind of like stay in your quadrant, I guess.
[17:59.400 --> 18:00.720]  Gavin, what do you want from me?
[18:00.720 --> 18:01.420]  I'm way up top.
[18:01.480 --> 18:02.620]  I'm all the way at the bottom.
[18:02.620 --> 18:05.000]  Nobody just go all the way down until you can't.
[18:05.120 --> 18:05.800]  Everyone... Oh, God.
[18:06.220 --> 18:06.920]  Orange, orange.
[18:07.020 --> 18:09.020]  Orange is the only one not shooting it.
[18:11.180 --> 18:11.900]  Red, red.
[18:12.660 --> 18:14.420]  Focus on a hole, you don't have to clear the whole thing.
[18:14.500 --> 18:15.940]  Focus on a hole, focus on a hole.
[18:16.100 --> 18:16.860]  Who fucking killed me?
[18:17.240 --> 18:18.520]  Me, because you're right at the front.
[18:19.280 --> 18:21.460]  We don't have to clear every color, just make a path.
[18:21.980 --> 18:23.840]  We don't have to clear every color, just make a path.
[18:23.840 --> 18:25.260]  Make a path, make a path.
[18:25.720 --> 18:29.140]  Oh, Nick's in hell.
[18:29.920 --> 18:31.120]  Okay, it's blue, go purple.
[18:32.400 --> 18:32.880]  Sorry.
[18:34.400 --> 18:35.660]  He's just clearing a path.
[18:36.940 --> 18:39.780]  I thought that the hole of two was a bit too stingy,
[18:39.840 --> 18:40.540]  so I went for a third.
[18:41.060 --> 18:41.400]  I agree.
[18:42.000 --> 18:42.480]  Yeah.
[18:44.400 --> 18:44.880]  Okay.
[18:46.500 --> 18:47.140]  Green's up.
[18:48.420 --> 18:50.140]  I'm going up, don't shoot me.
[18:50.940 --> 18:51.340]  Blue.
[18:52.700 --> 18:53.180]  Red.
[18:54.420 --> 18:54.900]  Purple.
[18:55.740 --> 18:57.300]  Okay, here comes green.
[18:57.300 --> 18:57.840]  Green.
[18:59.040 --> 18:59.360]  Orange.
[19:01.140 --> 19:01.460]  Blue.
[19:03.480 --> 19:03.800]  Blue.
[19:05.220 --> 19:05.840]  Get it, get it, get it.
[19:06.540 --> 19:08.840]  Here, follow me.
[19:10.380 --> 19:10.800]  That's it.
[19:11.600 --> 19:12.140]  That's all we need.
[19:14.200 --> 19:16.560]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
[19:16.720 --> 19:17.580]  This has been Pico Park.
[19:17.700 --> 19:18.280]  It's been a lot of fun.
[19:18.320 --> 19:19.240]  Oh, just sent me in.
[19:23.080 --> 19:24.620]  We're doing so well.
[19:24.620 --> 19:25.320]  We're doing great.
[19:25.380 --> 19:26.220]  This is easy.
[19:26.480 --> 19:28.480]  This is simple.
[19:28.680 --> 19:29.560]  Getting on to 501.
[19:29.640 --> 19:30.760]  I can't wait for 501.
[19:31.160 --> 19:32.240]  For the children.
[19:32.840 --> 19:36.000]  Is it the same again?
[19:36.300 --> 19:37.780]  Not all of us.
[19:37.860 --> 19:38.900]  I wasn't in a vehicle.
[19:40.940 --> 19:42.040]  I'm in a vehicle.
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.340]  I shouldn't jump.
[19:44.700 --> 19:45.460]  It's me and you, Andrew.
[19:45.820 --> 19:48.580]  If you're standing, don't jump.
[19:49.060 --> 19:50.000]  That's why I was learning.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.080]  You've got to learn.
[19:51.260 --> 19:52.120]  Me and you, Andrew.
[19:53.560 --> 19:54.860]  That's what I was learning.
[19:57.100 --> 19:58.260]  That's what I was learning.
[19:58.460 --> 20:00.060]  I didn't know whether it was like jumping on a train.
[20:00.960 --> 20:01.880]  Blue stop firing.
[20:02.100 --> 20:02.700]  It's just purple.
[20:03.220 --> 20:04.380]  Get me there.
[20:06.060 --> 20:08.260]  Eric wouldn't let me shoot because he had me too high.
[20:08.500 --> 20:08.900]  Eric?
[20:09.240 --> 20:11.160]  I was green at the top.
[20:12.040 --> 20:12.440]  Sorry.
[20:12.800 --> 20:13.200]  Sorry.
[20:16.300 --> 20:17.800]  Andrew doesn't want the pressure.
[20:18.580 --> 20:20.400]  He took one look at the challenge.
[20:22.060 --> 20:23.340]  Go Geoff!
[20:23.520 --> 20:25.180]  It was me that time.
[20:25.360 --> 20:27.280]  That was my fault.
[20:28.180 --> 20:29.080]  It's me and Andrew.
[20:29.800 --> 20:31.060]  I'm locked in.
[20:31.440 --> 20:32.020]  Team foreign.
[20:33.720 --> 20:34.360]  Easy.
[20:36.000 --> 20:36.640]  Blasting.
[20:38.180 --> 20:38.760]  There we go.
[20:38.880 --> 20:39.660]  Down a little bit.
[20:40.740 --> 20:41.920]  Now we're in business.
[20:42.600 --> 20:45.160]  Go up!
[20:45.160 --> 20:47.260]  Oh no!
[20:49.160 --> 20:50.260]  Did you just lose connection?
[20:50.460 --> 20:51.120]  Gavin, are you there?
[20:52.260 --> 20:52.580]  Gavin?
[20:53.880 --> 20:56.860]  I thought we were doing a bit.
[20:57.300 --> 20:58.920]  Maybe his power is out.
[20:59.300 --> 21:01.280]  Oh my god!
[21:02.400 --> 21:03.880]  I didn't enter the code.
[21:04.220 --> 21:05.760]  I just joined Gavin.
[21:06.380 --> 21:07.460]  Oh, cheeky.
[21:07.620 --> 21:09.340]  You've got to keep that shit to yourself, man.
[21:12.020 --> 21:13.800]  Alright, me and Eric.
[21:13.800 --> 21:14.700]  Fire in the chamber.
[21:16.660 --> 21:18.820]  I ain't got no friends in this one.
[21:18.900 --> 21:20.220]  What is happening?
[21:20.520 --> 21:20.660]  Red!
[21:22.740 --> 21:24.100]  Oh my god.
[21:24.840 --> 21:26.240]  You guys didn't even kill
[21:26.240 --> 21:27.440]  the things you were supposed to kill.
[21:27.540 --> 21:28.100]  What happened?
[21:29.020 --> 21:30.120]  I was mashing X.
[21:31.960 --> 21:33.860]  I have no responsibility here.
[21:34.260 --> 21:35.040]  Good job, Eric.
[21:35.360 --> 21:37.060]  Don't worry, we'll take those out too.
[21:38.200 --> 21:38.640]  Orange.
[21:39.340 --> 21:40.280]  Out of the way, orange.
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.680]  Out of the way, orange.
[21:42.620 --> 21:43.720]  Yeah, good job.
[21:44.600 --> 21:45.740]  Good job, everybody.
[21:46.620 --> 21:48.200]  Why did you knock me off?
[21:48.780 --> 21:49.180]  Where'd he go, Geoff?
[21:50.380 --> 21:52.360]  Wasn't Geoff's fault? Somebody knocked him off.
[21:52.600 --> 21:53.060]  Oh, sorry.
[21:54.640 --> 21:55.620]  Alright, me and Eric.
[21:58.060 --> 22:00.040]  Are you going to fire at all?
[22:00.240 --> 22:00.860]  Shit, shit, shit.
[22:01.160 --> 22:04.000]  I figured I'd stop it before
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.080]  because they just did this again.
[22:05.880 --> 22:08.620]  I just want to be the shooty McShooterton.
[22:08.620 --> 22:09.680]  And now I'm not.
[22:10.540 --> 22:12.620]  It doesn't...
[22:14.040 --> 22:15.860]  Gavin flew me into Nick.
[22:16.140 --> 22:17.880]  Guys, this is so easy. What's happening?
[22:18.140 --> 22:19.960]  I think you were about to get hit by a bullet.
[22:20.260 --> 22:20.820]  Alright, here you go.
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.740]  Way to go, Andrew Olmos.
[22:23.920 --> 22:24.840]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[22:25.260 --> 22:27.060]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[22:27.380 --> 22:29.260]  This is the easiest part.
[22:29.700 --> 22:31.540]  Alright, Gavin, here we go. Click an X.
[22:32.520 --> 22:32.980]  Shoot, Gavin.
[22:33.400 --> 22:35.740]  Who's red? I am. I'm just clicking X.
[22:35.740 --> 22:37.120]  Okay, great. I just want to make sure.
[22:37.360 --> 22:38.780]  I know who I'm playing with.
[22:39.260 --> 22:40.440]  Get me a hole. Get me a gap.
[22:41.080 --> 22:43.180]  That's my fault. I flew too high.
[22:43.560 --> 22:45.620]  I flew too close to the sun.
[22:45.660 --> 22:46.340]  My bad.
[22:47.260 --> 22:48.080]  All I can do is shoot.
[22:49.200 --> 22:49.940]  All I can do is shoot.
[22:51.020 --> 22:52.440]  Blue, I'm in your hands.
[22:53.560 --> 22:54.640]  Green clear in the way.
[22:56.240 --> 22:56.960]  Making space.
[22:57.380 --> 22:58.780]  Alright, there we go. Cleared a hole.
[22:59.920 --> 23:00.280]  Beautiful.
[23:00.760 --> 23:01.460]  Getting shot in the head.
[23:01.460 --> 23:02.180]  Yep.
[23:03.340 --> 23:04.320]  Alright, nice job.
[23:05.180 --> 23:05.800]  Look at that.
[23:06.220 --> 23:07.800]  Careful, careful.
[23:07.980 --> 23:09.860]  Everyone commute.
[23:11.120 --> 23:11.700]  Oh my god.
[23:13.360 --> 23:15.600]  You guys freaked me out.
[23:16.840 --> 23:18.200]  You guys freaked me out.
[23:18.640 --> 23:19.400]  Alright, shoot Geoff.
[23:19.560 --> 23:19.720]  It's you.
[23:21.200 --> 23:22.540]  Buzzing around like crazy.
[23:27.090 --> 23:28.430]  There you go.
[23:29.090 --> 23:29.330]  Alright.
[23:30.690 --> 23:31.550]  Go to town.
[23:31.790 --> 23:32.870]  I'm not shooting anymore.
[23:33.170 --> 23:33.550]  There we go.
[23:35.970 --> 23:37.170]  Yep, yep, yep.
[23:38.610 --> 23:39.110]  Why?
[23:44.750 --> 23:46.550]  I didn't expect you to die.
[23:47.250 --> 23:48.350]  That really shocked me.
[23:50.050 --> 23:50.810]  We're fine.
[23:51.470 --> 23:51.870]  Purple.
[23:53.630 --> 23:54.670]  Okay, now orange.
[23:54.790 --> 23:55.530]  Go up, go up, go up.
[23:55.530 --> 23:55.830]  Go up.
[23:59.530 --> 24:00.250]  Stop shooting.
[24:00.530 --> 24:01.530]  Stop shooting.
[24:02.070 --> 24:03.770]  I did, I'm sorry. That's my bad.
[24:04.230 --> 24:05.950]  Nick was just wanting to do more work.
[24:05.970 --> 24:07.670]  The thing Nick has been doing
[24:07.670 --> 24:09.510]  on 100% Eat is he fucks up
[24:09.510 --> 24:11.430]  and he goes, that's on me. And it's like, yeah, I know.
[24:11.990 --> 24:12.350]  Orange.
[24:14.630 --> 24:15.710]  Blue has to get it.
[24:15.910 --> 24:16.310]  There you go.
[24:18.150 --> 24:19.330]  Alright, let's see what we got next.
[24:19.370 --> 24:20.170]  Oh, it's just the door.
[24:20.270 --> 24:23.030]  Please stop. Oh my god.
[24:23.030 --> 24:24.790]  Just be patient.
[24:24.890 --> 24:25.310]  There you go.
[24:26.050 --> 24:27.750]  I was worried I'd run out of time.
[24:27.930 --> 24:28.630]  Oh my god.
[24:28.970 --> 24:33.110]  Why did it take me before Geoff?
[24:33.390 --> 24:34.070]  That was crazy.
[24:34.770 --> 24:36.270]  Geoff, will you just mash it X there?
[24:36.310 --> 24:37.450]  Because I think you saved us.
[24:37.750 --> 24:39.590]  No, I hit up.
[24:40.710 --> 24:41.670]  Oh god.
[24:44.990 --> 24:45.630]  Oh jeez.
[24:46.970 --> 24:47.950]  It's pretty zoomed in now.
[24:48.650 --> 24:49.530]  Oh jeez.
[24:50.090 --> 24:50.690]  Oh boy.
[24:51.130 --> 24:52.070]  Oh shit.
[24:52.430 --> 24:53.990]  Now go up.
[24:55.350 --> 24:56.550]  Alright, who's next?
[24:57.070 --> 24:57.290]  Green.
[25:03.090 --> 25:12.420]  Alright, blue and green.
[25:15.860 --> 25:17.600]  I don't know what you want.
[25:17.720 --> 25:19.000]  They were on top of me, man.
[25:21.640 --> 25:22.900]  Could you just not get up?
[25:24.340 --> 25:24.740]  No.
[25:26.060 --> 25:26.460]  No.
[25:27.000 --> 25:27.520]  I should have moved.
[25:28.600 --> 25:29.200]  Oh, it's me.
[25:29.860 --> 25:30.260]  Guys.
[25:33.320 --> 25:34.740]  Could be me again. It's not.
[25:36.040 --> 25:36.740]  All good.
[25:37.100 --> 25:38.120]  Very good. Very strong.
[25:38.860 --> 25:39.660]  Very amazing.
[25:40.300 --> 25:42.200]  Right at the top. There we go.
[25:43.280 --> 25:44.240]  I'm shot good.
[25:44.960 --> 25:46.100]  Green coming through. Move down, blue.
[25:46.300 --> 25:46.720]  There we go.
[25:47.280 --> 25:48.020]  Oh god.
[25:49.960 --> 25:51.600]  Why couldn't you guys fit?
[25:52.580 --> 25:53.940]  Someone was on top of me.
[25:54.600 --> 25:55.740]  I couldn't go up.
[25:57.480 --> 25:58.880]  Oh, I'm getting a burp stuck.
[25:58.980 --> 25:59.700]  I'm going to vomit again.
[26:00.140 --> 26:01.880]  Three of us went through no problem.
[26:02.440 --> 26:04.300]  Right, and two of us were stuck.
[26:07.300 --> 26:08.020]  See what?
[26:08.500 --> 26:09.240]  There we go.
[26:09.880 --> 26:11.960]  You were on top of me in that moment.
[26:12.060 --> 26:13.340]  I could not move.
[26:13.340 --> 26:15.060]  I was on the other side.
[26:16.140 --> 26:16.660]  Easy.
[26:19.620 --> 26:20.800]  There we go.
[26:22.300 --> 26:23.460]  Wow, it gave me
[26:23.460 --> 26:24.620]  no responsibility.
[26:25.340 --> 26:26.000]  That's perfect.
[26:29.820 --> 26:31.680]  I had 100% accuracy
[26:31.680 --> 26:33.220]  on that one. Way to go, buddy.
[26:33.500 --> 26:33.820]  Yeah.
[26:34.240 --> 26:35.020]  It's all good.
[26:42.140 --> 26:43.420]  Is that a shield?
[26:43.720 --> 26:44.980]  Yeah, it looks like a shield.
[26:45.320 --> 26:45.940]  Oh, what the?
[26:47.960 --> 26:48.960]  I got you.
[26:49.380 --> 26:50.900]  Nick, when you hit X, does it do anything?
[26:51.600 --> 26:52.680]  This is just what you have.
[26:53.040 --> 26:53.800]  This is what I got.
[26:54.560 --> 26:55.640]  Look for some components.
[26:56.020 --> 26:57.260]  What is that?
[26:58.580 --> 26:59.260]  Boss fight!
[26:59.260 --> 27:00.320]  Boss fight!
[27:01.700 --> 27:02.960]  Don't shoot each other.
[27:03.280 --> 27:03.480]  Yeah.
[27:06.360 --> 27:07.180]  We gotta
[27:07.180 --> 27:09.220]  stay kind of in fourths.
[27:09.220 --> 27:09.580]  Yeah.
[27:11.040 --> 27:12.520]  You got it, Gavin.
[27:14.180 --> 27:15.380]  How did the shield
[27:15.380 --> 27:16.360]  guy get hit?
[27:17.780 --> 27:19.420]  I'm gonna guess green shot him.
[27:19.800 --> 27:21.020]  I haven't shot him.
[27:23.060 --> 27:24.180]  Fan out.
[27:24.560 --> 27:27.160]  Stay above me, purple, and I'll stay below you.
[27:27.160 --> 27:28.360]  Then we won't kill each other.
[27:28.460 --> 27:30.000]  You mean me stay below you?
[27:30.320 --> 27:31.740]  Purple above orange.
[27:32.040 --> 27:34.820]  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were red.
[27:34.980 --> 27:36.120]  I thought you were red.
[27:38.140 --> 27:40.820]  I just turned the game on.
[27:40.860 --> 27:41.360]  Which one are you?
[27:42.800 --> 27:44.480]  I just shot the shit out of green.
[27:44.820 --> 27:47.200]  It's okay. I'm just staying away.
[27:48.000 --> 27:48.440]  Evading.
[27:48.800 --> 27:49.960]  Doing my best here.
[27:50.880 --> 27:51.220]  Oh!
[27:53.240 --> 27:54.180]  Get behind Andrew!
[27:54.180 --> 27:54.940]  Get behind Andrew!
[27:56.520 --> 27:58.340]  Gonna have to be behind Andrew there.
[27:58.800 --> 27:59.960]  Okay, whoever has the shield,
[28:00.080 --> 28:00.960]  you gotta stay in that middle.
[28:01.620 --> 28:02.380]  Orange, you wanna shoot these?
[28:03.080 --> 28:08.280]  Okay, I'm gonna stay at the very bottom.
[28:08.820 --> 28:10.080]  And then...
[28:10.080 --> 28:12.240]  Orange above green, green below orange.
[28:13.400 --> 28:14.240]  I'll stay in middle.
[28:14.700 --> 28:15.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:16.380 --> 28:18.320]  I think the thing we have to be aware of
[28:18.320 --> 28:20.380]  is when these bullets come, you just have to move some.
[28:20.640 --> 28:20.780]  Yep.
[28:20.780 --> 28:21.180]  Yeah.
[28:21.600 --> 28:24.280]  Nick, you might be up a little too far,
[28:24.420 --> 28:25.420]  but I mean, it's up to you.
[28:27.200 --> 28:28.180]  Oh my god.
[28:29.020 --> 28:29.440]  So close.
[28:30.540 --> 28:31.540]  Yeah, that works.
[28:32.840 --> 28:33.560]  There we go.
[28:35.180 --> 28:36.460]  So much damage.
[28:37.500 --> 28:38.340]  Keep firing!
[28:38.720 --> 28:39.760]  Get behind Nick!
[28:40.380 --> 28:41.540]  Stack it! Stack it!
[28:41.800 --> 28:42.660]  Stack up, fellas!
[28:44.400 --> 28:45.900]  Oh, who's jumbling?
[28:46.640 --> 28:47.780]  Geoff, he's just hitting buttons.
[28:48.340 --> 28:48.860]  Alright, go!
[28:49.620 --> 28:50.700]  Oh shit, Andrew!
[28:51.440 --> 28:52.460]  Uh, okay.
[28:52.780 --> 28:53.740]  Oh, more missiles!
[28:55.300 --> 28:56.900]  We can dodge them though, we don't need the shield.
[28:57.840 --> 28:58.680]  I'll stay in the middle.
[29:00.720 --> 29:01.360]  Sorry, Nick.
[29:01.560 --> 29:02.080]  That was me.
[29:03.700 --> 29:04.540]  I got you with one.
[29:05.400 --> 29:05.860]  Geoff died.
[29:06.040 --> 29:10.080]  Oh, this is gonna be a long boss fight.
[29:10.160 --> 29:10.580]  This is hard.
[29:11.200 --> 29:12.660]  I think we got it.
[29:12.740 --> 29:13.620]  Oh, I can do the shield.
[29:15.680 --> 29:16.040]  Uh...
[29:16.880 --> 29:17.240]  Okay.
[29:18.160 --> 29:19.320]  Are we in different spots now?
[29:19.600 --> 29:21.060]  Yeah, we are. Why are you up here?
[29:21.180 --> 29:21.980]  I'm gonna stay down here.
[29:22.080 --> 29:22.800]  Alright, I'll go down then.
[29:25.800 --> 29:27.520]  The only thing that's really tough
[29:27.520 --> 29:29.840]  is when we start, like when those bullets come in,
[29:30.040 --> 29:32.240]  just stop shooting
[29:32.240 --> 29:33.980]  and move sort of back and forth.
[29:34.120 --> 29:36.080]  What do I do as a Mr. Shield man?
[29:36.220 --> 29:37.280]  Do I just stand in the middle here?
[29:37.580 --> 29:39.200]  Yeah, stay in the middle and then shield.
[29:39.520 --> 29:41.660]  And then somebody shoots me from behind.
[29:41.660 --> 29:42.900]  Yeah, yeah, get shot by Andrew.
[29:43.360 --> 29:44.400]  And then, yeah, you got it.
[29:45.220 --> 29:46.560]  Mr. Shield man.
[29:47.620 --> 29:49.380]  Bring me a shield.
[29:49.820 --> 29:51.040]  It's in your name.
[29:51.380 --> 29:52.780]  Get behind him.
[29:54.000 --> 29:54.840]  Oh my god.
[29:55.080 --> 29:55.700]  Oh my god!
[30:00.300 --> 30:01.280]  Alright, spread out.
[30:01.440 --> 30:02.140]  Back to where we were.
[30:02.760 --> 30:05.520]  Yeah, that was really tough.
[30:06.400 --> 30:07.080]  Oh, he's so low.
[30:07.080 --> 30:07.760]  Ah!
[30:10.020 --> 30:10.460]  Yeah!
[30:12.500 --> 30:13.860]  Oh yeah, there we go.
[30:13.940 --> 30:14.920]  There we go, there we go.
[30:15.120 --> 30:15.440]  Easy.
[30:15.560 --> 30:18.840]  Great job, everybody.
[30:20.460 --> 30:21.260]  So good.
[30:21.640 --> 30:23.060]  Another level down for the
[30:23.060 --> 30:25.480]  Regulation Podcast, guys. Thank you so much for watching.
[30:26.940 --> 30:27.700]  This is a gameplay.
[30:27.960 --> 30:29.020]  Thanks for all the gifted subs.
[30:29.440 --> 30:31.320]  It's been great.
[30:31.460 --> 30:31.800]  Thank you!
[30:32.880 --> 30:35.220]  Everybody in the chat, do you guys listen
[30:35.220 --> 30:36.420]  to the Regulation Podcast?
[30:36.780 --> 30:38.680]  Or do you just watch us on Twitch?
[30:39.360 --> 30:41.200]  Or do you just watch us on YouTube?
[30:41.860 --> 30:42.740]  I wonder.
[30:43.600 --> 30:45.420]  You guys listen to the podcast?
[30:45.820 --> 30:46.360]  What's the podcast?
[30:47.080 --> 30:47.940]  Yeah, that's right.
[30:48.480 --> 30:50.480]  I'm afraid of that answer, but, you know.
[30:52.740 --> 30:53.820]  That was my homie.
[30:53.940 --> 30:54.340]  The who?
[30:54.940 --> 30:56.400]  That was my homie Mark the Frog.
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.180]  Mark the Frog.
[30:58.540 --> 31:00.500]  What is this?
[31:00.960 --> 31:01.440]  Slug.
[31:01.440 --> 31:03.380]  We know these from Gears.
[31:04.260 --> 31:05.900]  What's the thing on the top doing?
[31:06.360 --> 31:07.180]  I don't know.
[31:07.180 --> 31:07.620]  What does it mean?
[31:08.340 --> 31:09.980]  I don't know. I don't understand.
[31:11.460 --> 31:13.320]  Let's just keep moving.
[31:13.980 --> 31:16.640]  It stops you from moving if you're...
[31:16.640 --> 31:17.380]  Oh, I see.
[31:17.520 --> 31:19.440]  The three who are moving cause the other two
[31:19.440 --> 31:20.640]  to be unable to move.
[31:21.640 --> 31:22.640]  Does that make sense?
[31:23.800 --> 31:24.860]  I see. Yeah.
[31:27.480 --> 31:28.740]  Why am I sliding away?
[31:28.740 --> 31:29.960]  I don't know.
[31:30.840 --> 31:32.960]  Because only the three who are in the top
[31:32.960 --> 31:33.900]  can move at the moment.
[31:34.100 --> 31:34.860]  Oh, it's a fan.
[31:40.720 --> 31:42.900]  Nick just yelling the same thing.
[31:45.920 --> 31:47.320]  I'm just explaining it to you.
[31:47.420 --> 31:48.400]  You guys are going to need that.
[31:48.620 --> 31:50.100]  I fell over. I haven't gotten that far of it.
[31:50.800 --> 31:51.180]  Hold on.
[31:55.600 --> 31:56.620]  There we go.
[31:56.860 --> 31:57.340]  Easy.
[31:57.340 --> 31:57.520]  Easy.
[32:01.200 --> 32:03.220]  I still don't know if I fully understand
[32:03.220 --> 32:05.220]  what just happened, but we beat it, so I don't really care.
[32:05.320 --> 32:07.600]  I'll tell you what happened. We kicked the shit out of that level.
[32:07.900 --> 32:09.320]  The three at the top could move
[32:09.320 --> 32:10.140]  and the rest of...
[32:10.840 --> 32:13.300]  Oh, there's a fan.
[32:14.700 --> 32:15.240]  NFTSteven asked
[32:15.240 --> 32:16.940]  where this week's GTA and Minecraft are.
[32:17.040 --> 32:18.500]  I think GTA came out.
[32:23.300 --> 32:25.500]  We're in the middle of no Nick November
[32:25.500 --> 32:27.200]  which is all of our heists.
[32:28.160 --> 32:28.280]  Yeah!
[32:30.180 --> 32:34.220]  I don't know what we're supposed to do.
[32:34.420 --> 32:35.180]  Just wait a second.
[32:35.700 --> 32:36.480]  Stop moving!
[32:37.980 --> 32:38.960]  He's not scared.
[32:38.980 --> 32:40.380]  He's not intimidated by the jump.
[32:40.760 --> 32:42.500]  Is it like a boo? Like granny footsteps?
[32:44.080 --> 32:45.040]  Oh, yeah.
[32:45.940 --> 32:47.060]  I think we have to walk
[32:47.060 --> 32:48.160]  really, really, really slow.
[32:51.560 --> 32:52.620]  How's everybody's ankles?
[32:55.240 --> 32:55.660]  Like...
[32:55.660 --> 32:56.380]  Oh, God.
[32:57.300 --> 32:58.280]  Do it in little nugs.
[32:58.900 --> 33:00.900]  Yeah, it's not about holding a stick.
[33:01.120 --> 33:02.440]  It's about doing a little tap.
[33:03.120 --> 33:03.960]  Oh, my God.
[33:04.580 --> 33:06.020]  Was that a little tap that got you killed?
[33:06.240 --> 33:07.760]  Wait, it's red light, green light?
[33:07.980 --> 33:09.880]  How is it like red light, green light?
[33:14.280 --> 33:14.700]  What?
[33:16.180 --> 33:17.130]  I still don't...
[33:17.860 --> 33:19.340]  Is it too many people moving at once?
[33:19.440 --> 33:20.660]  Like only one person can move?
[33:20.960 --> 33:20.980]  Oh!
[33:20.980 --> 33:22.400]  Okay, so ready and go.
[33:23.460 --> 33:23.980]  Stop.
[33:24.580 --> 33:25.100]  Orange.
[33:27.640 --> 33:28.640]  Okay, here I go.
[33:29.780 --> 33:30.760]  Nick went for some reason.
[33:30.780 --> 33:31.840]  That's my bad.
[33:31.960 --> 33:32.480]  Sorry.
[33:34.280 --> 33:36.980]  Nope, I just...
[33:39.680 --> 33:40.760]  Nope, that was my fault.
[33:41.120 --> 33:41.380]  Go on.
[33:44.860 --> 33:46.320]  Nick, I'm gonna go.
[33:48.260 --> 33:48.780]  What?
[33:55.860 --> 33:57.180]  Look at us.
[33:57.420 --> 33:58.420]  Now I'm going?
[33:58.740 --> 33:59.500]  All the way to the door, yeah.
[34:01.400 --> 34:02.560]  Alright, my turn?
[34:03.760 --> 34:05.620]  Nick, I'm going to go.
[34:07.140 --> 34:07.780]  What?
[34:19.080 --> 34:19.500]  Oh!
[34:22.460 --> 34:23.100]  Oh!
[34:24.960 --> 34:25.600]  Oh!
[34:25.760 --> 34:27.260]  Oh, my God!
[34:28.140 --> 34:29.580]  This is a horror movie.
[34:30.240 --> 34:30.880]  Oh!
[34:30.880 --> 34:31.160]  Oh!
[34:35.060 --> 34:36.440]  I'm scared to move now.
[34:37.060 --> 34:37.700]  Ah!
[34:38.100 --> 34:41.000]  Did we get killed by the menu?
[34:41.420 --> 34:41.920]  What happened?
[34:42.660 --> 34:43.740]  Press X button to...
[34:43.740 --> 34:45.340]  To show what?
[34:46.220 --> 34:46.760]  Oh!
[34:48.040 --> 34:50.700]  We only move behind the...
[34:52.040 --> 34:53.540]  Okay, I'm gonna show it.
[34:54.720 --> 34:55.940]  Oh, my God!
[34:56.540 --> 34:58.240]  Red, you stay still.
[34:58.240 --> 34:59.080]  Everyone else move right.
[35:01.220 --> 35:02.000]  Am I moving?
[35:02.400 --> 35:04.340]  Okay, I think we're good. Here we go.
[35:05.340 --> 35:06.260]  We didn't move.
[35:06.620 --> 35:08.120]  So, Geoff, did you not move?
[35:08.280 --> 35:09.860]  I can't move. There he goes.
[35:10.320 --> 35:11.180]  You wouldn't let me.
[35:12.680 --> 35:14.420]  Why didn't the guy above me move?
[35:18.200 --> 35:19.820]  Everyone but Andrew hold right.
[35:21.640 --> 35:22.800]  Wait, who's on the top?
[35:22.880 --> 35:23.800]  You probably shouldn't hold right.
[35:24.340 --> 35:25.040]  No, I'm not gonna.
[35:25.040 --> 35:27.460]  Okay, cool. Oh, my God. How are we gonna do this?
[35:27.980 --> 35:29.240]  Maybe I'll go right first.
[35:29.900 --> 35:30.980]  Oh, I'm just gonna fall in.
[35:31.380 --> 35:31.840]  Oh, boy.
[35:31.920 --> 35:33.440]  I made it.
[35:34.880 --> 35:35.460]  Did you?
[35:36.900 --> 35:38.400]  Nice. Oh, buddy, Geoff.
[35:38.500 --> 35:39.140]  Get off me.
[35:40.520 --> 35:43.240]  Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
[35:43.720 --> 35:44.400]  Did you go?
[35:44.940 --> 35:45.200]  Yeah.
[35:46.240 --> 35:47.100]  Okay, here we go.
[35:50.160 --> 35:50.600]  Wow.
[35:52.300 --> 35:52.740]  Yes!
[35:54.000 --> 35:54.360]  Okay.
[35:55.220 --> 35:56.880]  Yeah, I think you're gonna have to.
[35:58.280 --> 35:58.940]  All right, Geoff.
[35:58.960 --> 35:59.460]  Hold right.
[36:03.270 --> 36:04.210]  Oh, my God.
[36:04.830 --> 36:05.310]  Did I jump?
[36:05.790 --> 36:06.530]  Yeah, I heard it.
[36:08.030 --> 36:08.390]  Yay!
[36:10.630 --> 36:11.830]  Okay, Geoff, you stay there.
[36:12.810 --> 36:13.890]  Nick, you're gonna have to go and jump.
[36:14.610 --> 36:14.870]  Yep.
[36:18.250 --> 36:19.930]  Okay, I'm gonna jump.
[36:20.030 --> 36:21.390]  Andrew, I just need you to move a little bit right.
[36:21.390 --> 36:21.570]  Okay.
[36:22.610 --> 36:24.390]  Okay, there you go.
[36:24.430 --> 36:25.690]  Okay, that should be good.
[36:26.190 --> 36:27.210]  All right, Gavin, you ready?
[36:29.910 --> 36:31.050]  Just to get up there, you mean?
[36:31.210 --> 36:31.930]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:34.510 --> 36:35.890]  Eric walking into someone.
[36:36.150 --> 36:36.710]  Just shut up.
[36:37.390 --> 36:37.750]  Yep.
[36:38.970 --> 36:40.130]  Okay, so you didn't go.
[36:42.630 --> 36:43.590]  I'm gonna get up there.
[36:44.270 --> 36:45.370]  Oh, yeah? All right.
[36:45.510 --> 36:46.750]  Oh, the thing that he said to do?
[36:47.010 --> 36:47.370]  Crazy.
[36:48.050 --> 36:50.150]  Well, I was waiting for Geoff, but Geoff didn't go.
[36:50.530 --> 36:52.790]  Oh, now we're gonna have to stack.
[36:52.970 --> 36:54.270]  No fucking way!
[36:56.450 --> 36:58.070]  All right, let me get up right behind Andrew.
[36:58.290 --> 36:58.710]  Okay.
[37:00.290 --> 37:01.370]  Okay, ready?
[37:01.870 --> 37:02.310]  Yeah.
[37:03.950 --> 37:05.630]  I'm gonna jump and go over to the right.
[37:05.750 --> 37:05.770]  Ready?
[37:07.370 --> 37:07.890]  Oh, boy.
[37:10.010 --> 37:11.250]  I heard a jump.
[37:12.530 --> 37:13.030]  Oh, nice.
[37:13.410 --> 37:15.070]  Gotta do it twice.
[37:17.370 --> 37:18.910]  Oh, fuck. That's it.
[37:22.310 --> 37:23.650]  Oh, God. Okay.
[37:23.890 --> 37:24.790]  I should get on Eric?
[37:25.090 --> 37:25.430]  Yeah.
[37:27.630 --> 37:28.950]  I think I'm good.
[37:34.130 --> 37:35.430]  I gave you clearance.
[37:38.030 --> 37:40.450]  I don't know what we're doing. This doesn't feel right.
[37:40.810 --> 37:41.490]  I think I'm on Nick.
[37:42.690 --> 37:44.150]  Yeah. Oh, my God.
[37:44.430 --> 37:46.590]  There's the button that's gonna allow the rest of us in.
[37:46.590 --> 37:47.070]  Ugh.
[37:47.990 --> 37:49.690]  Oh, did I get up? Oh, shit.
[37:50.050 --> 37:52.550]  I don't know. We can wait. We can wait.
[37:53.030 --> 37:53.770]  We got time.
[37:54.050 --> 37:55.790]  Take a step to the right.
[37:56.870 --> 37:57.530]  Just Gavin.
[37:59.110 --> 38:00.630]  I did it, but I don't know
[38:00.630 --> 38:01.330]  if it was enough.
[38:02.030 --> 38:02.830]  We'll find out.
[38:04.110 --> 38:04.870]  I fell in.
[38:06.130 --> 38:07.250]  Yeah, you went to the left.
[38:07.830 --> 38:08.950]  No, I fell in the hole.
[38:09.350 --> 38:09.990]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:11.010 --> 38:13.030]  I went back down so you can jump on me.
[38:13.030 --> 38:15.010]  Oh, you should've
[38:15.010 --> 38:16.370]  just gone up.
[38:17.130 --> 38:17.750]  Oh, yeah.
[38:22.030 --> 38:22.830]  Okay. Okay.
[38:24.430 --> 38:24.830]  Okay.
[38:25.090 --> 38:26.290]  Gavin, you got this.
[38:26.570 --> 38:28.090]  You jump up and move to the right.
[38:29.550 --> 38:30.350]  Yeah? Okay.
[38:30.630 --> 38:32.310]  And then, Geoff, are you ready? Yeah.
[38:33.870 --> 38:35.130]  Okay. You're gonna move a little bit
[38:35.130 --> 38:36.750]  more right, Gavin, and then it's gonna be all Geoff.
[38:37.870 --> 38:38.270]  Nice.
[38:38.730 --> 38:40.590]  Very good. Oh, my God.
[38:41.270 --> 38:42.490]  Not sure where I am.
[38:42.570 --> 38:43.430]  I'm gonna wait to see.
[38:44.230 --> 38:46.570]  Okay, all right. So you're gonna go up and a little bit.
[38:46.630 --> 38:47.630]  You're just gonna get on Gavin here.
[38:48.770 --> 38:50.650]  Brilliant. Yep. I think I did,
[38:50.750 --> 38:51.710]  but I'm not positive. Okay.
[38:53.550 --> 38:54.290]  No. Okay.
[38:55.150 --> 38:56.810]  Gavin, do not touch anything.
[38:59.450 --> 39:00.530]  I'm putting... My controller
[39:00.530 --> 39:01.990]  is down. Yep. Okay. Ready?
[39:03.770 --> 39:04.550]  Look at that.
[39:04.570 --> 39:06.630]  Geoff, you're gonna go a little bit right.
[39:07.110 --> 39:07.430]  Okay.
[39:07.430 --> 39:07.530]  Okay.
[39:10.880 --> 39:12.600]  How you feeling? I don't know.
[39:12.740 --> 39:14.520]  I just tapped once. Oh, yes!
[39:14.700 --> 39:16.300]  Okay, this is gonna be it. Ready?
[39:16.840 --> 39:17.540]  Make the jump!
[39:20.840 --> 39:23.040]  Oh, I heard a button! I heard the button!
[39:23.640 --> 39:24.040]  Yeah!
[39:27.200 --> 39:27.940]  Let's go!
[39:28.420 --> 39:31.100]  How far are we going? I don't know, but let's not go too far
[39:31.100 --> 39:32.840]  and fall down a hole
[39:32.840 --> 39:33.600]  or something. Okay.
[39:34.860 --> 39:35.960]  Oh, we gotta stack again.
[39:37.360 --> 39:37.880]  Oh, what?
[39:38.700 --> 39:39.800]  Let's keep moving right a little
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.680]  so we can see what's next. Yeah, everyone just keep moving right.
[39:42.760 --> 39:43.480]  Okay, here we go.
[39:44.200 --> 39:44.400]  Oh.
[39:46.620 --> 39:47.380]  There we go.
[39:50.320 --> 39:50.680]  Woo!
[39:52.880 --> 39:53.240]  Ooh!
[39:54.380 --> 39:54.740]  Wee!
[39:54.960 --> 39:55.320]  Nice!
[39:57.520 --> 39:59.820]  I think that'll do it. So now one of us has to come
[39:59.820 --> 40:01.020]  off? Like, go up?
[40:02.860 --> 40:03.340]  What the?
[40:03.340 --> 40:03.620]  What the?
[40:04.740 --> 40:05.660]  It's crushing me!
[40:07.320 --> 40:09.080]  Alright, everybody move to the right a little, please.
[40:09.320 --> 40:11.340]  Yeah, okay. Move to the right.
[40:11.740 --> 40:13.320]  Yep, okay. Alright, here we go.
[40:14.460 --> 40:15.300]  Okay. Yay!
[40:15.480 --> 40:17.140]  So, Nick, you're gonna get on? Yep!
[40:18.620 --> 40:19.060]  I'm coming!
[40:19.280 --> 40:20.460]  Okay, but hang on.
[40:21.020 --> 40:22.940]  Nobody get off. Nobody get off.
[40:22.960 --> 40:25.600]  We need to talk about what we're about to do.
[40:26.660 --> 40:27.100]  Yes.
[40:27.320 --> 40:29.320]  We need to stack all
[40:29.320 --> 40:30.820]  on top of the person
[40:30.820 --> 40:32.280]  who's on the right.
[40:32.660 --> 40:33.660]  And walk off. Yeah.
[40:34.260 --> 40:35.800]  And then they walk off.
[40:36.580 --> 40:38.060]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:38.660 --> 40:38.920]  No.
[40:40.660 --> 40:41.720]  It's not high enough.
[40:43.100 --> 40:44.540]  I think we just all need to, like,
[40:44.700 --> 40:46.460]  hold right and then jump like shit.
[40:47.820 --> 40:48.440]  We can try it.
[40:49.340 --> 40:49.740]  Okay.
[40:50.580 --> 40:51.720]  If you wanna do it, let's do it.
[40:51.840 --> 40:52.820]  Everyone hold right and jam A.
[40:54.240 --> 40:55.600]  I don't think we made it.
[40:56.540 --> 40:57.880]  Someone jumped on my head, I think.
[40:57.880 --> 40:58.120]  Yeah.
[40:59.700 --> 41:00.720]  We made it!
[41:01.880 --> 41:03.840]  I can't believe it!
[41:04.100 --> 41:06.040]  Alright, someone has to go down there and open that door.
[41:06.460 --> 41:07.800]  It was on top of the stack.
[41:07.940 --> 41:08.980]  That was so surprising.
[41:09.760 --> 41:11.820]  Why am I... Okay. Orange and blue
[41:11.820 --> 41:12.240]  move left.
[41:13.460 --> 41:14.320]  Not too far.
[41:18.700 --> 41:19.440]  Where are you at? Cool.
[41:23.640 --> 41:24.440]  Am I in?
[41:24.660 --> 41:25.020]  Yes!
[41:26.620 --> 41:28.180]  Way to go, guys. That was great.
[41:28.880 --> 41:30.120]  I'm really impressed with that.
[41:30.120 --> 41:31.240]  That was awesome.
[41:32.300 --> 41:34.080]  Wow! Incredible. Good job, guys.
[41:34.720 --> 41:36.080]  That was a very
[41:36.080 --> 41:38.080]  creative level. And...
[41:38.080 --> 41:39.860]  We're creeping towards 5.01pm,
[41:40.040 --> 41:41.540]  the best time of the week.
[41:41.600 --> 41:43.780]  The best time of the week.
[41:43.940 --> 41:44.420]  Let's do it.
[41:46.720 --> 41:48.120]  Only a week away from
[41:48.120 --> 41:50.240]  Gerplers. Oh, it's a ghostie.
[41:50.620 --> 41:51.720]  How do we...
[41:51.720 --> 41:53.980]  One of us has to face it, I think,
[41:54.040 --> 41:54.860]  at all times. Okay.
[41:56.040 --> 41:58.240]  Should I just ride Andrew and face it?
[41:58.240 --> 41:59.860]  Yes. Yeah, let's do that.
[42:00.580 --> 42:01.560]  Let's go!
[42:02.840 --> 42:03.360]  Okay.
[42:04.020 --> 42:05.400]  I'll look back. Go ahead.
[42:07.900 --> 42:09.540]  We have to keep it alive.
[42:10.440 --> 42:12.040]  But he's already dead!
[42:12.440 --> 42:14.380]  So we have to lure him down.
[42:14.500 --> 42:15.560]  Everyone face away.
[42:17.040 --> 42:18.080]  Let's get...
[42:18.080 --> 42:18.760]  Oh shit!
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.300]  You go. I'll watch him.
[42:21.820 --> 42:22.380]  There you go.
[42:23.260 --> 42:25.200]  Nick, I'm watching, so you go.
[42:25.200 --> 42:25.480]  Okay.
[42:26.760 --> 42:28.900]  Now I'm gonna go and you stay green?
[42:29.220 --> 42:30.520]  Yep. I got it.
[42:30.620 --> 42:31.160]  Hang on.
[42:32.140 --> 42:34.720]  No, no. Everyone look away.
[42:38.740 --> 42:40.580]  Purple, stay watching him.
[42:40.660 --> 42:41.780]  Thank you.
[42:42.520 --> 42:45.400]  Now we look away. No, no. Everyone look away.
[42:45.940 --> 42:46.940]  What do you think that does?
[42:48.020 --> 42:48.500]  Oh dear.
[42:48.700 --> 42:49.460]  It probably does this.
[42:51.120 --> 42:53.140]  Orange, you need to get off of it.
[42:55.940 --> 42:57.200]  Okay, we need to...
[42:58.900 --> 43:01.540]  Who wants to be the one to tease him over a little bit?
[43:03.060 --> 43:05.200]  I'll watch him at the end here and flip back
[43:05.200 --> 43:06.160]  if we want to move him a little.
[43:07.060 --> 43:08.620]  So red, look away.
[43:10.780 --> 43:12.300]  Oh shit! I turned around!
[43:12.520 --> 43:13.580]  Yeah, you did. What happened?
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.220]  I don't know. Could it be after we touched the button?
[43:17.540 --> 43:18.420]  No, I don't think so.
[43:18.520 --> 43:19.920]  No, we'd already hit it before.
[43:20.800 --> 43:22.920]  Maybe he just didn't feel like obeying.
[43:22.920 --> 43:24.520]  Okay, everyone look away.
[43:24.780 --> 43:28.880]  Okay, now somebody watch him.
[43:29.720 --> 43:30.120]  Watching him.
[43:33.340 --> 43:35.020]  Now, everyone look away.
[43:38.220 --> 43:40.840]  Maybe it needs to be two eyes on him to stop him.
[43:41.080 --> 43:42.420]  I don't... is it?
[43:43.500 --> 43:44.600]  Let's try it out now.
[43:45.260 --> 43:46.480]  Everyone except someone.
[43:47.400 --> 43:48.140]  Oh, what did that?
[43:48.460 --> 43:49.040]  I think it's one.
[43:49.040 --> 43:51.500]  No, Geoff turned as well.
[43:51.980 --> 43:52.900]  I think so, yeah.
[43:53.260 --> 43:54.440]  Alright, Nick, go up there.
[43:57.140 --> 43:58.020]  I'll cover you.
[43:58.840 --> 43:59.720]  Thank you.
[44:01.320 --> 44:02.340]  Let's figure out
[44:02.340 --> 44:04.000]  what exactly we're doing here.
[44:05.080 --> 44:05.480]  Yeah, see that?
[44:06.260 --> 44:07.820]  We're gonna ride it.
[44:08.800 --> 44:09.320]  Are we?
[44:10.800 --> 44:13.020]  We'll have five seconds to get over.
[44:13.620 --> 44:15.140]  So get two people looking.
[44:15.600 --> 44:16.280]  Okay, so hang on.
[44:16.280 --> 44:17.700]  Blue, jump on top of me.
[44:19.080 --> 44:20.320]  Blue, jump on top of green.
[44:20.520 --> 44:21.320]  Red, come over.
[44:21.540 --> 44:22.720]  Purple, jump on top of red.
[44:24.780 --> 44:25.660]  And then...
[44:25.660 --> 44:28.100]  Orange, we're watching, so hit the button
[44:28.100 --> 44:28.920]  and run all the way over.
[44:29.360 --> 44:30.680]  And then, everyone look away.
[44:32.440 --> 44:33.260]  And look back!
[44:34.120 --> 44:34.720]  And look away!
[44:35.160 --> 44:35.940]  And look back!
[44:36.880 --> 44:38.420]  Why do you keep looking back?
[44:38.680 --> 44:39.400]  I got scared!
[44:39.600 --> 44:40.360]  Now look back!
[44:40.360 --> 44:42.200]  Get off!
[44:43.520 --> 44:45.940]  Oh, it's a checkpoint!
[44:46.280 --> 44:47.720]  Is he gonna give it to us or not?
[44:48.020 --> 44:48.320]  Maybe.
[44:53.420 --> 44:54.600]  Same thing again.
[44:55.740 --> 44:57.080]  We need to get him down.
[44:57.840 --> 44:59.760]  See, it's only one person needs to be watching him.
[45:00.280 --> 45:02.660]  No, but two people have to face him to stop him again.
[45:03.780 --> 45:04.380]  Thanks, Nick.
[45:09.340 --> 45:10.540]  Well, we didn't call it at that time.
[45:10.720 --> 45:11.440]  Alright, let's get him down.
[45:11.900 --> 45:12.120]  Ready?
[45:14.900 --> 45:16.040]  I'm watching him, you go.
[45:16.520 --> 45:16.640]  Alright.
[45:18.260 --> 45:20.080]  Keep going, keep going, everybody else.
[45:20.860 --> 45:22.200]  Yeah, but what if we all just hang out here?
[45:22.460 --> 45:22.720]  You got him?
[45:24.220 --> 45:25.100]  And tease him out?
[45:25.740 --> 45:25.920]  Yep.
[45:28.700 --> 45:29.020]  Go.
[45:30.440 --> 45:32.320]  Okay, so now we need to not hit the button.
[45:36.140 --> 45:36.620]  Let's...
[45:36.620 --> 45:38.000]  Okay, we need to get him closer.
[45:38.280 --> 45:38.960]  Everyone look away.
[45:39.380 --> 45:40.120]  I'm looking away.
[45:40.860 --> 45:42.280]  Yeah, that's great.
[45:43.180 --> 45:44.640]  I'm just declaring, I'm just saying.
[45:44.820 --> 45:45.740]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[45:46.100 --> 45:47.060]  Alright, Andrew, go ahead.
[45:48.700 --> 45:49.180]  Gavin.
[45:51.660 --> 45:52.140]  Blue.
[45:53.520 --> 45:55.520]  Okay, Nick, you keep watching him.
[45:56.060 --> 45:56.200]  Yeah.
[45:57.200 --> 45:58.620]  Alright, so let's designate.
[45:59.040 --> 46:00.480]  Now, I'm watching him.
[46:01.480 --> 46:02.160]  Yep, and blue.
[46:03.300 --> 46:04.760]  You're gonna jump on the button,
[46:04.880 --> 46:07.160]  come across, and we're gonna look away as we start moving.
[46:07.340 --> 46:08.460]  But before you do that,
[46:09.020 --> 46:11.640]  why don't we just designate the two turners
[46:12.160 --> 46:13.080]  on this journey?
[46:13.380 --> 46:14.540]  Okay, who do you want us to charge?
[46:14.580 --> 46:15.080]  Green and blue.
[46:15.540 --> 46:16.500]  Okay, green and blue, great.
[46:17.180 --> 46:17.960]  Alright, y'all ready?
[46:19.100 --> 46:19.640]  Let's go.
[46:20.920 --> 46:21.320]  Ready?
[46:22.480 --> 46:22.880]  Go.
[46:22.880 --> 46:23.000]  Ready?
[46:23.920 --> 46:24.320]  Turn.
[46:25.740 --> 46:26.500]  Way to go, Gavin!
[46:29.840 --> 46:30.560]  Green and blue.
[46:34.880 --> 46:36.540]  No, no, explain to me
[46:36.540 --> 46:37.460]  what we all did.
[46:37.920 --> 46:39.840]  You just said, ready, ready, ready,
[46:39.900 --> 46:41.880]  and then I had one millisecond to turn.
[46:42.020 --> 46:43.160]  How am I gonna know what you're gonna say?
[46:47.890 --> 46:49.990]  That was one of the worst things.
[46:50.170 --> 46:51.150]  Nick, why are you here?
[46:51.150 --> 46:52.290]  That's a Gears death.
[46:52.690 --> 46:54.350]  No, it isn't! He just said it.
[46:55.650 --> 46:57.090]  I got you, come on.
[46:57.230 --> 46:59.250]  Alright, you ready? Everybody turn away
[46:59.250 --> 47:00.970]  for a second. Me and Eric will turn back.
[47:02.450 --> 47:02.850]  A little more?
[47:03.390 --> 47:03.590]  Yeah.
[47:05.290 --> 47:06.130]  You go ahead.
[47:07.710 --> 47:08.150]  I got him.
[47:13.970 --> 47:15.050]  Okay, Nick, I got him.
[47:15.270 --> 47:15.470]  Go ahead.
[47:15.710 --> 47:18.810]  Alright, watch the button.
[47:18.810 --> 47:20.810]  When the button hits zero or whatever...
[47:22.470 --> 47:22.830]  Turn!
[47:24.630 --> 47:26.870]  That was 100% on me.
[47:29.770 --> 47:31.130]  100%, no other way to put it.
[47:31.310 --> 47:32.110]  No other way to put it.
[47:32.690 --> 47:33.470]  Everyone move over.
[47:35.810 --> 47:36.870]  Okay, Nick, keep an eye on him.
[47:36.890 --> 47:37.210]  I got you.
[47:37.970 --> 47:39.710]  Okay, go ahead and tease him over.
[47:40.170 --> 47:41.510]  I got you, I got you. You're good.
[47:42.730 --> 47:43.870]  Alright, I got you.
[47:43.890 --> 47:45.010]  I can't see well.
[47:45.710 --> 47:47.210]  You can't see well?
[47:49.650 --> 47:51.210]  Nick, tease him over.
[47:51.410 --> 47:53.210]  He slapped my head down onto it.
[47:53.570 --> 47:54.250]  Geoff, turn around.
[47:58.550 --> 48:01.370]  Okay, Nick, don't run over
[48:01.370 --> 48:03.030]  and hit the button. We need to tease him over
[48:03.030 --> 48:03.730]  a little bit more.
[48:04.050 --> 48:05.790]  So come over.
[48:07.210 --> 48:08.270]  Who's in charge of turning?
[48:09.050 --> 48:10.710]  Me and Eric.
[48:11.230 --> 48:13.810]  Okay, I'm going...
[48:13.810 --> 48:14.670]  Okay, I'm set.
[48:16.230 --> 48:17.550]  I'm the only one looking at him,
[48:17.650 --> 48:18.990]  so you hit the button, come over.
[48:20.350 --> 48:21.650]  Okay, I'm looking at him.
[48:24.130 --> 48:24.890]  Looking away.
[48:28.210 --> 48:28.590]  Good.
[48:29.130 --> 48:30.610]  Okay, everyone off, everyone off, everyone off.
[48:31.030 --> 48:32.090]  We didn't turn around!
[48:34.830 --> 48:35.930]  It's not going to give it to us.
[48:36.150 --> 48:36.750]  We already hit it once.
[48:37.310 --> 48:38.890]  Oh, it gave it to us!
[48:39.450 --> 48:40.850]  I'll watch, I'll watch, I'll watch.
[48:43.810 --> 48:44.810]  Alright, Nick, I...
[48:45.510 --> 48:46.450]  Let's tease him over.
[48:48.470 --> 48:50.130]  This is going well as heck.
[48:51.570 --> 48:52.950]  Didn't realize those moved.
[48:53.250 --> 48:53.930]  Yeah, they move.
[48:54.510 --> 48:55.330]  See that now.
[48:55.550 --> 48:57.870]  Good call out.
[48:59.150 --> 49:00.070]  Nick, I got him.
[49:00.590 --> 49:02.830]  We got some moving spikes over here.
[49:03.010 --> 49:04.530]  Alright, let's tease him.
[49:05.490 --> 49:06.090]  Geoff, turn away.
[49:07.090 --> 49:07.910]  Andrew, turn away.
[49:08.870 --> 49:09.390]  Ready?
[49:09.390 --> 49:10.190]  Ready?
[49:11.090 --> 49:13.030]  I'll keep watching, you go.
[49:13.670 --> 49:14.490]  I'll wait.
[49:17.030 --> 49:18.470]  Stop, stop, stop.
[49:18.570 --> 49:22.610]  Okay, I got it.
[49:23.770 --> 49:24.510]  Ready to tease?
[49:24.690 --> 49:25.890]  Everyone face away.
[49:27.410 --> 49:27.990]  Here we go.
[49:28.650 --> 49:31.430]  Oh, the spikes kill him!
[49:31.710 --> 49:32.590]  Right, right, right.
[49:32.930 --> 49:34.550]  Gotta keep the dead from dying.
[49:35.090 --> 49:36.030]  What the fuck?
[49:36.750 --> 49:38.090]  That's okay, we got that checkpoint.
[49:38.450 --> 49:39.970]  Alright, guys, there's some moving spikes.
[49:42.190 --> 49:43.830]  Alright, Nick, I'm gonna tease him over.
[49:44.850 --> 49:45.330]  Yeah, you ready?
[49:45.550 --> 49:46.210]  Yep, look away.
[49:47.210 --> 49:47.970]  And now!
[49:50.570 --> 49:51.330]  And close!
[49:51.750 --> 49:54.090]  Okay, Nick, I'm gonna go to the other side.
[49:54.170 --> 49:54.810]  You keep watching him.
[49:56.770 --> 49:57.130]  And...
[49:57.630 --> 49:58.470]  Okay, come on over.
[49:59.830 --> 50:00.210]  Okay.
[50:02.710 --> 50:04.290]  Good job avoiding those moving spikes.
[50:04.290 --> 50:06.230]  Okay, hang on, ready?
[50:07.350 --> 50:07.550]  Yep.
[50:09.030 --> 50:09.310]  Now!
[50:09.870 --> 50:11.410]  Why didn't he stop?
[50:11.970 --> 50:14.390]  I think my controller made me turn back around.
[50:14.510 --> 50:16.150]  My joystick was too sensitive, sorry.
[50:16.450 --> 50:16.790]  That's okay.
[50:17.790 --> 50:18.910]  Alright, everyone move to the right.
[50:20.550 --> 50:22.650]  It's always a bummer when your controller makes you.
[50:22.770 --> 50:23.890]  Okay, face away.
[50:24.350 --> 50:26.210]  And then, Nick, now!
[50:26.570 --> 50:26.910]  There we go.
[50:27.190 --> 50:28.050]  Alright, you guys move up.
[50:28.750 --> 50:29.970]  Watch out for those spikes, they move.
[50:32.210 --> 50:32.650]  Uh...
[50:32.650 --> 50:33.310]  Okay, you're good there.
[50:33.930 --> 50:34.830]  I got you covered.
[50:34.990 --> 50:35.370]  Okay.
[50:37.710 --> 50:39.830]  You're gonna make the move to look...
[50:39.830 --> 50:40.750]  Gavin, you have to look away.
[50:41.850 --> 50:43.890]  I don't know why the person at the top
[50:43.890 --> 50:45.510]  doesn't just look...
[50:45.510 --> 50:47.010]  Why didn't you stop him?
[50:47.050 --> 50:47.690]  I don't know.
[50:48.310 --> 50:50.530]  Why doesn't whoever's furthest forward just look back?
[50:51.170 --> 50:52.050]  Okay, let's do that.
[50:57.970 --> 50:58.830]  Alright, come on, Eric.
[50:58.830 --> 50:59.630]  I got you.
[51:03.400 --> 51:05.060]  Okay, y'all ready to tease him over?
[51:05.200 --> 51:05.340]  Yep.
[51:05.860 --> 51:08.240]  Alright, let's do it.
[51:10.060 --> 51:11.180]  Alright, I'm gonna look back.
[51:11.360 --> 51:12.040]  I'm looking back.
[51:12.220 --> 51:12.400]  Okay.
[51:12.560 --> 51:13.760]  Come over as you see fit.
[51:17.240 --> 51:17.600]  Alright.
[51:21.420 --> 51:22.480]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:22.780 --> 51:24.000]  We have to make him get the key.
[51:24.920 --> 51:25.280]  Oh.
[51:25.580 --> 51:25.920]  Oh.
[51:26.340 --> 51:28.000]  So we need to be down at the bottom, do we?
[51:29.160 --> 51:30.200]  I don't know.
[51:30.860 --> 51:31.960]  We need to go further.
[51:32.100 --> 51:32.980]  We need to go past.
[51:33.920 --> 51:34.940]  Oh, oh, oh.
[51:34.940 --> 51:35.640]  He's gonna die.
[51:37.980 --> 51:39.540]  We need to go past the key.
[51:39.900 --> 51:41.360]  We need to tease him to keep him low.
[51:41.560 --> 51:41.800]  Yeah.
[51:43.460 --> 51:45.460]  That's tough. I got you, Nick.
[51:45.900 --> 51:46.100]  Come on.
[51:49.760 --> 51:50.880]  Hey, hey, Geoff.
[51:51.280 --> 51:52.460]  Geoff, you wanna call up the spikes?
[51:52.460 --> 51:54.640]  That was on me.
[51:54.800 --> 51:55.300]  My bad, guys.
[51:56.020 --> 51:57.780]  You know what? It's okay, Geoff. Spikes?
[51:58.380 --> 52:00.280]  You haven't seen it yet. You can't call it.
[52:00.300 --> 52:02.320]  You don't know. Hey, guys, there's spikes.
[52:11.660 --> 52:12.880]  Nick, watch him.
[52:13.260 --> 52:13.980]  Okay, I'm coming.
[52:15.420 --> 52:16.120]  Okay, go ahead.
[52:16.400 --> 52:18.740]  Gavin, you're...
[52:18.740 --> 52:19.420]  Go.
[52:21.340 --> 52:23.640]  Alright, I can look at him and you can all come over.
[52:28.020 --> 52:29.200]  We need to...
[52:29.680 --> 52:30.480]  No, no, no.
[52:30.680 --> 52:35.320]  We just need to get him further. That's fine.
[52:35.720 --> 52:36.240]  Yeah, that's all.
[52:37.680 --> 52:38.400]  We got this.
[52:39.240 --> 52:40.500]  Shit, this is hard.
[52:40.820 --> 52:41.060]  Easy.
[52:42.740 --> 52:45.640]  We were fucking jet pilots earlier. We can do this.
[52:45.720 --> 52:46.100]  That's true.
[52:46.620 --> 52:47.320]  Ah, my eyes.
[52:50.060 --> 52:50.940]  Alright, I'm looking.
[52:51.360 --> 52:51.720]  I got you.
[52:53.080 --> 52:54.580]  I'm gonna get him close.
[52:54.920 --> 52:56.400]  So, look away.
[52:59.560 --> 53:00.600]  Okay, Nick, look back.
[53:01.800 --> 53:02.720]  Somebody look at him.
[53:03.600 --> 53:04.480]  I'm looking at you.
[53:04.680 --> 53:05.160]  Okay, thank you.
[53:06.080 --> 53:08.980]  But you don't have to be so close to him to do that.
[53:13.980 --> 53:14.420]  Spikes.
[53:14.420 --> 53:15.660]  Andrew, stop looking at him.
[53:16.820 --> 53:17.900]  The person in the front?
[53:20.620 --> 53:21.580]  Hey guys, spikes.
[53:22.240 --> 53:23.060]  I'm intuiting.
[53:24.300 --> 53:25.920]  Get him over here.
[53:26.040 --> 53:26.900]  Yeah, they're there. I was right.
[53:27.700 --> 53:30.440]  Hey, good call out, Geoff.
[53:31.260 --> 53:32.100]  What you eating, Nick?
[53:33.120 --> 53:33.880]  Cough drop.
[53:34.420 --> 53:35.920]  Are you sick?
[53:36.060 --> 53:36.240]  No.
[53:36.640 --> 53:38.980]  Just for funsies.
[53:39.400 --> 53:40.920]  Alright, whenever you're ready, Gavin.
[53:41.800 --> 53:42.160]  Okay.
[53:44.040 --> 53:44.400]  Okay.
[53:46.040 --> 53:46.760]  Jesus Christ.
[53:47.440 --> 53:49.200]  This is officially the furthest we've been.
[53:49.620 --> 53:50.920]  Alright, so let's...
[53:53.240 --> 53:53.960]  I'm gonna...
[53:53.960 --> 53:55.240]  Eric, you gotta keep looking at him.
[53:55.580 --> 53:55.880]  Yeah.
[53:57.800 --> 53:59.860]  So we can all get to this kind of level.
[54:00.040 --> 54:00.860]  Are you sure? You got him, Nick?
[54:00.900 --> 54:01.040]  Yeah.
[54:02.880 --> 54:05.260]  And then if we all stack here, he'll definitely go through the key, right?
[54:05.440 --> 54:07.460]  Okay, so I'm here. Nick, you wanna come through?
[54:09.660 --> 54:11.280]  Uh, okay.
[54:11.520 --> 54:13.200]  Somebody look just so I can get here.
[54:13.620 --> 54:15.180]  Okay, I'm gonna look.
[54:16.080 --> 54:17.120]  I'm looking at him.
[54:17.320 --> 54:18.160]  Everyone else look away.
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.220]  Ready?
[54:20.260 --> 54:21.200]  Jesus Christ.
[54:21.980 --> 54:22.860]  Look back, look back.
[54:23.260 --> 54:24.640]  Okay, hang on.
[54:25.100 --> 54:26.400]  Gavin, keep looking at him.
[54:26.940 --> 54:27.300]  Okay.
[54:28.800 --> 54:30.980]  So we need to...
[54:30.980 --> 54:32.280]  I'm looking at him now.
[54:32.600 --> 54:33.900]  Everyone make your move to the right.
[54:34.280 --> 54:36.680]  And then do we just have to snatch it from his undercarriage?
[54:36.920 --> 54:37.760]  I think so.
[54:38.960 --> 54:39.320]  So...
[54:39.820 --> 54:41.680]  We need him to get higher like this.
[54:41.760 --> 54:43.440]  So Gavin, you're gonna keep looking at him.
[54:43.760 --> 54:43.960]  Yeah.
[54:45.440 --> 54:48.100]  Here, I'll look at him, and then maybe Gavin gets on top
[54:48.100 --> 54:49.000]  so we can go up higher.
[54:49.160 --> 54:51.360]  Do you think doing like a trio thing?
[54:51.740 --> 54:52.920]  Gavin, will you jump on me?
[54:54.840 --> 54:55.200]  Okay.
[54:55.780 --> 54:58.080]  I'm gonna look away. Nick's gonna look away.
[54:58.400 --> 55:00.340]  And Gavin, it's on you to just get him close.
[55:02.780 --> 55:03.500]  Okay.
[55:03.540 --> 55:04.260]  Perfect.
[55:05.640 --> 55:06.360]  Geoff.
[55:06.560 --> 55:07.620]  I'm gonna go get it.
[55:08.120 --> 55:08.840]  Yes!
[55:09.340 --> 55:10.720]  Look at this.
[55:11.260 --> 55:11.980]  Andrew.
[55:14.300 --> 55:15.960]  Geoff, stay there.
[55:16.460 --> 55:17.780]  Don't worry, you guys all go through.
[55:18.280 --> 55:18.580]  There you go.
[55:20.320 --> 55:21.240]  Good luck.
[55:22.580 --> 55:23.480]  That's it.
[55:24.000 --> 55:24.400]  No!
[55:26.140 --> 55:26.720]  Excuse me?
[55:27.360 --> 55:28.980]  5-0-1
[55:28.980 --> 55:29.640]  PM!
[55:30.700 --> 55:32.480]  What a finish!
[55:33.840 --> 55:34.640]  Oh, we're done.
[55:35.160 --> 55:35.320]  Wow.
[55:36.160 --> 55:36.680]  Incredible.
[55:37.240 --> 55:39.580]  Dude, at 5-0-1, it was meant to be.
[55:40.060 --> 55:41.700]  What a phenomenal gameplay.
[55:42.040 --> 55:43.300]  That was crazy.
[55:43.840 --> 55:45.780]  We still have so much more Pico Park to go.
[55:45.780 --> 55:46.760]  How many more do we have to go?
[55:47.860 --> 55:48.900]  Let's take a look.
[55:49.240 --> 55:52.420]  I screamed so loud, I knocked my headphones out of my computer
[55:52.420 --> 55:54.100]  and the cable out of the headphone.
[55:54.100 --> 55:55.800]  I unplugged from both sides.
[55:56.340 --> 55:56.880]  Oh my god.
[55:57.460 --> 55:59.440]  There's five here. Keep going.
[56:00.480 --> 56:02.680]  I'm telling you, there's 19 plus the shadow realm.
[56:04.320 --> 56:04.960]  Wow.
[56:06.720 --> 56:08.400]  Guys, that's the power
[56:08.400 --> 56:09.580]  of 5-0-1.
[56:10.240 --> 56:12.160]  And that's the power of
[56:12.160 --> 56:13.380]  GURP Friday.
[56:13.900 --> 56:16.300]  Next Friday at noon central.
[56:16.580 --> 56:18.460]  We are moving our stream time
[56:18.460 --> 56:20.300]  for one day
[56:20.300 --> 56:21.300]  only.
[56:21.300 --> 56:23.780]  At noon central, be here.
[56:23.980 --> 56:25.460]  It's the return of
[56:25.460 --> 56:27.380]  Mario Party. The return of
[56:27.380 --> 56:28.180]  Dilkong.
[56:28.580 --> 56:31.440]  That is also the time that the new
[56:31.440 --> 56:33.000]  regulation GURPLers
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.460]  will go on sale.

[56:56.900 --> 56:58.860]  Guys, any final thoughts?
[56:59.160 --> 57:01.180]  Very important things to let people
[57:01.180 --> 57:01.480]  know.
[57:03.520 --> 57:04.560]  We're stomping!
[57:07.480 --> 57:08.440]  What did he say?
[57:08.920 --> 57:10.360]  I don't know. We're stomping?
[57:11.700 --> 57:12.220]  Stomping?
[57:12.740 --> 57:13.900]  We're stomping?
[57:14.020 --> 57:16.400]  I can stomp. We can stomp.
[57:16.400 --> 57:17.900]  Have you ever seen stomp?
[57:18.240 --> 57:19.080]  I saw
[57:20.620 --> 57:22.140]  stomp live. Was it good?
[57:22.280 --> 57:24.120]  Yeah, great show. I was like 11
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.240]  so it was cool. They banged on trash cans
[57:26.240 --> 57:28.240]  and I went home and I beat the shit out of a trash can.
[57:28.280 --> 57:30.340]  Whack the shit out of metal trash cans for a couple
[57:30.340 --> 57:32.160]  hours, right? But they're not
[57:32.160 --> 57:34.380]  the blue man group at the same time.
[57:34.440 --> 57:36.620]  That's different. No, that's different.
[57:36.900 --> 57:38.280]  Maybe they should combine those two.
[57:38.820 --> 57:40.520]  Yeah. Stomp man group.
[57:41.420 --> 57:42.160]  Blue stomp.
[57:42.960 --> 57:44.360]  Blue stomp. Well guys,
[57:44.360 --> 57:46.600]  thank you so much for watching and
[57:47.200 --> 57:48.360]  we will see you
[57:48.360 --> 57:49.220]  next time. Bye!
[57:50.160 --> 57:52.180]  Love you, bye! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
