[00:00.420 --> 00:03.140]  Okay, would somebody record a backup video just in case?
[00:03.880 --> 00:05.860]  Since my stuff is... is not perfect.
[00:08.500 --> 00:09.360]  Record the Discord?
[00:10.700 --> 00:13.480]  No, the backup of my video.
[00:16.200 --> 00:16.980]  Just in case.
[00:17.380 --> 00:17.940]  What does that mean?
[00:19.580 --> 00:22.440]  In case my video crashes and I don't have video for the file,
[00:22.500 --> 00:24.500]  it would be nice if somebody had a backup of what we could use.
[00:25.040 --> 00:25.600]  So the Discord?
[00:27.640 --> 00:28.060]  Sure.
[00:28.240 --> 00:28.860]  I don't care.
[00:28.860 --> 00:31.760]  I said, can somebody record the backup of the video?
[00:31.840 --> 00:33.800]  How many fucking videos are we dealing with right now?
[00:34.060 --> 00:36.460]  How many videos do you see right now in front of you?
[00:36.940 --> 00:38.920]  Is it a confusing amount?
[00:39.560 --> 00:42.240]  I asked if you bet they'll be recording the Discord and you said no.
[00:42.340 --> 00:43.480]  So then I was like, what else can we record?
[00:45.520 --> 00:46.480]  Now Geoff gets it.
[00:46.540 --> 00:46.680]  Yeah.
[00:48.600 --> 00:49.640]  I hate you guys.
[00:50.280 --> 00:50.560]  What?
[00:50.780 --> 00:52.060]  Don't put it on us!
[00:52.200 --> 00:54.560]  I didn't even... me and Andrew... me and Andrew are being polite.
[00:54.580 --> 00:55.220]  I'm on your side!
[00:55.680 --> 00:56.820]  Sitting here quietly, yeah.
[00:56.820 --> 00:59.340]  Yeah, Andrew's actually on your side.
[00:59.380 --> 01:01.400]  Welcome to another episode of Geoff and the Cunts.
[01:01.520 --> 01:02.660]  I hope you guys like Doom.
[01:02.760 --> 01:02.980]  What?
[01:04.420 --> 01:05.560]  What did we do?
[01:05.780 --> 01:06.920]  We didn't do anything.
[01:07.020 --> 01:08.520]  Guilty by assassination!
[01:09.160 --> 01:10.560]  Oh, you know what? He's got us there.
[01:11.360 --> 01:12.300]  Oh my god.
[01:12.420 --> 01:14.380]  I hope you guys feel really good right now, physically.
[01:15.760 --> 01:18.140]  Gavin is taking Geoff to the dark ages.
[01:18.400 --> 01:19.960]  Geoff, we're gonna play some Doom.
[01:21.260 --> 01:23.740]  Alright, campaign, new slot.
[01:23.880 --> 01:25.840]  What difficulty do you want me to play it on?
[01:25.840 --> 01:27.060]  Hurt Me Plenty.
[01:27.640 --> 01:30.180]  Okay, what are you talking about? No way.
[01:30.640 --> 01:31.460]  You can Pandemonium.
[01:32.440 --> 01:32.880]  Excuse me?
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.380]  You don't want to play on Pandemonium?
[01:35.760 --> 01:37.620]  I'd like to see him make progress.
[01:39.700 --> 01:43.300]  I don't think that Geoff is gonna handle much more than Hurt Me Plenty.
[01:43.620 --> 01:45.820]  So let's... I agree with Andrew. Let's go there.
[01:46.060 --> 01:47.240]  Is that what you were playing on before?
[01:47.720 --> 01:47.940]  Yeah.
[01:48.040 --> 01:50.160]  If anybody else would rather play on a different difficulty,
[01:50.340 --> 01:53.200]  I will happily concede this video to you as a...
[01:53.200 --> 01:54.000]  No, you didn't ask that.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.540]  You asked what difficulty you should play on.
[01:56.680 --> 01:58.600]  As a guy who's not a Doom fan,
[01:58.760 --> 02:01.020]  I'm happy to give it to somebody else who might be.
[02:01.440 --> 02:02.300]  Dude, I love Doom.
[02:02.860 --> 02:03.760]  Why don't you play it?
[02:03.760 --> 02:04.620]  Yeah, what happened here?
[02:04.680 --> 02:06.560]  I want to watch you play on Pandemonium.
[02:06.780 --> 02:08.080]  I just want to see you play.
[02:08.440 --> 02:10.420]  Okay, because I give two shits about Doom.
[02:10.680 --> 02:11.240]  Just so you know.
[02:11.920 --> 02:12.760]  Parry window.
[02:13.420 --> 02:14.440]  Oh, you can customize a lot.
[02:14.980 --> 02:17.580]  Yeah, the customization in this is like insane.
[02:17.880 --> 02:18.160]  Damn.
[02:18.240 --> 02:19.300]  It's so crazy.
[02:19.400 --> 02:21.680]  Probably best played by someone who enjoys the game.
[02:22.100 --> 02:23.340]  But... yeah, dude, you.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.520]  I'm not a Doom fan.
[02:25.960 --> 02:27.040]  That's not what I'm hearing.
[02:27.100 --> 02:27.760]  You don't enjoy the game.
[02:27.880 --> 02:28.420]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:28.420 --> 02:30.240]  I never... I never have...
[02:31.260 --> 02:32.840]  Gavin, I can't believe you've done this.
[02:34.060 --> 02:35.620]  I'm still confused about the beginning.
[02:35.740 --> 02:36.620]  Wait, why do you have a gun?
[02:36.960 --> 02:37.520]  I don't...
[02:38.000 --> 02:38.800]  You're a menace.
[02:39.660 --> 02:40.160]  Who, me?
[02:40.180 --> 02:40.920]  This is my favorite.
[02:40.920 --> 02:41.260]  Yes!
[02:41.480 --> 02:43.300]  This is my favorite video.
[02:43.900 --> 02:45.720]  This is my favorite video.
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.360]  Hey, Andrew, you're back on my good side.
[02:50.360 --> 02:52.500]  For recognizing that Gavin is a menace.
[02:53.460 --> 02:53.780]  Needlessly.
[02:54.280 --> 02:56.260]  I was asking you what I'm recording and you didn't answer.
[02:57.300 --> 02:58.580]  You knew what I meant, dude.
[02:59.000 --> 02:59.760]  Dude, I...
[02:59.760 --> 02:59.780]  What?
[02:59.940 --> 03:00.740]  You did know what you meant.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.040]  It's fucked up that you did that.
[03:02.140 --> 03:02.860]  You're being pedantic.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.940]  Even Nick agrees. Nick never likes anything.
[03:04.980 --> 03:05.220]  Yeah.
[03:05.380 --> 03:07.740]  I was trying to get input and I didn't know what you were talking about.
[03:07.860 --> 03:09.260]  I'm king of the pedantry.
[03:09.460 --> 03:09.760]  Pedantry?
[03:12.520 --> 03:13.120]  Good jump.
[03:16.000 --> 03:16.860]  Why do you have a gun?
[03:17.780 --> 03:18.320]  What do you mean?
[03:18.780 --> 03:18.800]  Old...
[03:18.800 --> 03:19.940]  This is Doom, dude.
[03:19.940 --> 03:20.860]  But you're in the dark times.
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.340]  I don't think it's set in the past.
[03:24.460 --> 03:25.900]  I think it's like a setting.
[03:26.120 --> 03:27.600]  Like, I don't think it's a time thing.
[03:27.960 --> 03:29.860]  I think it's the aesthetic of this game.
[03:30.340 --> 03:31.780]  Nick, this is my boomstick.
[03:32.000 --> 03:32.100]  Okay.
[03:32.280 --> 03:32.780]  Oh, I got...
[03:32.780 --> 03:33.340]  Okay, I'm in.
[03:34.460 --> 03:34.860]  Yeah.
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.160]  And this is his boom shield.
[03:36.740 --> 03:38.420]  Real army of darkness situation here.
[03:41.400 --> 03:41.800]  Okay.
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.840]  I just wanted to see if there's anything on the other side of that.
[03:45.880 --> 03:51.020]  Doom, as you guys who are Doom fans know, there's tons of shit everywhere.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.020]  Absolutely.
[03:52.020 --> 03:53.120]  Yeah, there's tons of secrets.
[03:53.320 --> 03:55.520]  I'm glad you are doing this, Geoff, because I was curious,
[03:55.660 --> 03:59.140]  because you can eventually counter one of those and explode it.
[03:59.140 --> 04:00.360]  Yeah, the green ones you can counter.
[04:00.640 --> 04:00.760]  Yeah.
[04:00.760 --> 04:01.020]  Yeah.
[04:01.160 --> 04:03.400]  I didn't remember if that one ever shot green or not.
[04:03.580 --> 04:04.240]  No, it doesn't.
[04:06.240 --> 04:09.700]  I imagine you got to go through it on different difficulties and stuff to unlock stuff.
[04:10.520 --> 04:10.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:10.900 --> 04:11.380]  Like Pandemonium?
[04:11.580 --> 04:12.480]  I already know how to do this stuff.
[04:13.860 --> 04:15.780]  Yeah, so this is like if you...
[04:15.780 --> 04:16.340]  Oh, shit!
[04:16.360 --> 04:17.760]  It's almost like a gravity hammer in Halo.
[04:18.280 --> 04:20.600]  Yeah, it's honestly like a grappling hook,
[04:20.600 --> 04:22.260]  because you lock right onto it.
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.700]  Yeah, this is definitely akin to like the grappling hook they had in previous games,
[04:26.820 --> 04:27.380]  where it's like...
[04:28.240 --> 04:30.200]  It just does so much like radius damage, too.
[04:30.320 --> 04:30.480]  It's...
[04:30.480 --> 04:31.380]  Oh, God, it's so cool.
[04:33.860 --> 04:34.260]  You're...
[04:34.260 --> 04:38.260]  This one feels maybe a little bit slower than the previous games.
[04:38.360 --> 04:38.700]  Oh, definitely.
[04:39.660 --> 04:41.340]  Like you're a little bit more of a tank.
[04:42.040 --> 04:44.780]  Are you trying to tell me that my reflexes didn't just
[04:45.760 --> 04:47.760]  improve dramatically without me realizing it?
[04:48.260 --> 04:49.920]  Since the last time I played a Doom game?
[04:50.400 --> 04:51.120]  You're doing great.
[04:51.280 --> 04:51.760]  You're doing great.
[04:52.280 --> 04:56.600]  There's like six fucking collectibles a level or something I gotta find.
[04:56.740 --> 04:57.700]  Yeah, there's tons of secrets.
[04:58.380 --> 04:59.140]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[04:59.400 --> 05:01.220]  The last...
[05:01.220 --> 05:03.660]  I think Blaine described it really well, where he said like,
[05:03.720 --> 05:05.180]  this one feels like you're more of a tank,
[05:05.300 --> 05:08.080]  and the last game felt like you're more of like a jet fighter.
[05:08.360 --> 05:12.180]  Like there's like so much more speed and like nimbleness to the last ones.
[05:12.600 --> 05:13.700]  This is a lot more like...
[05:14.880 --> 05:18.280]  They want you to keep moving, but it is very much like...
[05:18.280 --> 05:19.340]  You have a shield.
[05:19.340 --> 05:20.780]  Stand your ground.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  You can use your shield.
[05:22.240 --> 05:23.080]  Find your space.
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.140]  Yeah, slightly slower.
[05:24.300 --> 05:25.840]  What number game is this of the modern ones?
[05:26.240 --> 05:26.700]  The third one.
[05:26.780 --> 05:27.300]  The third one, I think.
[05:27.440 --> 05:27.920]  The third one.
[05:28.140 --> 05:29.680]  This is the third one.
[05:32.460 --> 05:35.320]  This reminds me of the speed difference between Halo 2 and 3.
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.800]  Like the other one was so much faster.
[05:38.120 --> 05:38.480]  Dickhead.
[05:39.500 --> 05:41.700]  It's funny you say the speed difference between Halo 2 and 3,
[05:41.780 --> 05:44.260]  because Halo 3 is also so slow when you go back to it.
[05:44.360 --> 05:44.560]  Yes.
[05:44.640 --> 05:45.200]  Oh my god.
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.540]  When did they put sprinting on Reach?
[05:49.380 --> 05:50.240]  I think so.
[05:50.440 --> 05:51.320]  Yeah, I think so.
[05:52.540 --> 05:53.260]  Was it in 4?
[05:53.280 --> 05:53.620]  Let me know if I'm missing.
[05:53.620 --> 05:54.740]  So is that like your...
[05:54.740 --> 05:58.260]  That's your guys' like FPS sort of like touchstone, right?
[05:58.320 --> 05:58.900]  Is Halo?
[05:59.140 --> 05:59.360]  Yes.
[05:59.960 --> 06:00.180]  Yeah.
[06:00.960 --> 06:02.000]  I just never...
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.100]  I like never played Halo.
[06:03.320 --> 06:06.060]  It's the center of my FPS universe.
[06:07.320 --> 06:07.960]  They're just...
[06:07.960 --> 06:08.940]  It was just never...
[06:09.540 --> 06:10.100]  It's awesome.
[06:11.160 --> 06:11.540]  I don't know.
[06:11.680 --> 06:14.060]  It was just like never on like my radar or something where I'm like,
[06:14.100 --> 06:14.720]  I'm playing Halo.
[06:15.420 --> 06:16.040]  So I play...
[06:16.040 --> 06:17.980]  I mean, I love FPS games.
[06:18.120 --> 06:18.540]  Like I...
[06:18.540 --> 06:20.040]  You should try Halo. It's a really good one.
[06:21.660 --> 06:23.300]  I'm hearing the third one's kind of slow.
[06:24.900 --> 06:28.520]  Like genre-wise, FPS is probably like my favorite genre of game.
[06:28.960 --> 06:30.040]  But yeah, I don't know.
[06:30.100 --> 06:32.500]  Halo just was never a thing for me.
[06:32.680 --> 06:34.920]  You shot a lot of that guy's head off, but he kept going.
[06:35.520 --> 06:35.720]  Yeah.
[06:35.820 --> 06:36.200]  Oh, dude.
[06:36.200 --> 06:37.280]  Yeah, you can chunk him.
[06:37.440 --> 06:38.280]  He's pretty good.
[06:38.460 --> 06:38.980]  It's wild.
[06:39.140 --> 06:39.360]  People!
[06:39.560 --> 06:40.280]  These guys...
[06:40.280 --> 06:41.520]  They're just fucking hanging out.
[06:41.660 --> 06:42.880]  Look, I was hanging out with these people yesterday.
[06:42.880 --> 06:43.300]  Oh no!
[06:43.640 --> 06:45.760]  This person lost an arm and you're like,
[06:45.760 --> 06:47.440]  Oh my god, the horror, the tragedy.
[06:47.640 --> 06:48.660]  It's this poor woman, right?
[06:48.920 --> 06:49.860]  It can't get any worse.
[06:49.940 --> 06:51.100]  But then you walk over here and...
[06:52.780 --> 06:53.460]  It got worse.
[06:53.640 --> 06:53.960]  Oh no!
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.100]  They're already dead.
[06:55.300 --> 06:55.580]  Yeah.
[06:55.720 --> 06:56.360]  There was a guy...
[06:56.360 --> 06:56.880]  Oh no, this guy.
[06:57.120 --> 06:58.080]  This guy lost a leg.
[06:58.440 --> 06:59.640]  Whole ass leg gone.
[07:00.020 --> 07:03.200]  They don't do a ton for like binding up these gaping wounds.
[07:03.400 --> 07:04.880]  They're just kind of crouched over.
[07:05.060 --> 07:05.700]  They're not doing a lot.
[07:05.740 --> 07:06.260]  Oh, they're hovering.
[07:07.140 --> 07:08.340]  Well, they live in like a castle.
[07:08.680 --> 07:09.640]  That might do something here.
[07:10.060 --> 07:13.220]  This also doesn't look like the most sanitary of place to triage.
[07:13.380 --> 07:14.520]  But I guess you guys...
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.380]  These guys, I stood here for a while trying to convince them they will not go in.
[07:18.460 --> 07:19.940]  I was like, I'll take the last row.
[07:20.200 --> 07:21.280]  We move up, you know?
[07:21.820 --> 07:23.040]  Do like stacks, move up.
[07:23.080 --> 07:23.820]  I replace the back.
[07:23.880 --> 07:24.580]  You guys go forward.
[07:24.900 --> 07:25.260]  They don't.
[07:25.400 --> 07:26.200]  So I'm like, okay.
[07:26.720 --> 07:27.660]  Classic, classic army.
[07:27.800 --> 07:28.860]  I'll go in first, right?
[07:28.900 --> 07:29.840]  And then you guys will follow me.
[07:29.920 --> 07:30.460]  You guys come right...
[07:31.180 --> 07:32.340]  You guys, you're just gonna stay there.
[07:32.660 --> 07:37.480]  Also, this guy is three feet away, clutching his chest in excruciating pain.
[07:37.740 --> 07:38.460]  And they're just like...
[07:38.460 --> 07:39.200]  That's so funny.
[07:39.460 --> 07:39.740]  We can't reach!
[07:40.140 --> 07:41.400]  We can't get to you, man.
[07:41.540 --> 07:43.500]  We can't, it's too...
[07:43.500 --> 07:44.580]  Coast isn't clear.
[07:45.920 --> 07:47.120]  See that blood trail?
[07:48.380 --> 07:49.600]  That was somebody.
[07:50.260 --> 07:52.100]  Yeah, that was Ted.
[07:52.340 --> 07:52.560]  This guy.
[07:52.820 --> 07:53.620]  That was that guy.
[07:55.240 --> 07:57.280]  He's pretty attacked for how much blood is on the ground.
[07:57.880 --> 08:00.800]  Hey, since this is an old castle, do you think I should go and try to like,
[08:01.200 --> 08:04.860]  pull down all of the different sconces and things on the walls?
[08:05.020 --> 08:07.700]  See if I can open up secret portals?
[08:08.040 --> 08:09.100]  Make sure to grab all the books.
[08:09.660 --> 08:12.000]  Yeah, some like real like blueprints relation type stuff.
[08:13.260 --> 08:15.840]  What game has the most sconce action?
[08:16.460 --> 08:16.760]  Scabble!
[08:17.440 --> 08:17.840]  Sconce.
[08:18.860 --> 08:20.160]  It's a great question.
[08:21.180 --> 08:22.380]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:22.840 --> 08:23.700]  I'm not gonna go out.
[08:23.880 --> 08:25.900]  Were there any sconces in Eternal Darkness?
[08:26.840 --> 08:27.780]  ODST dropped in.
[08:28.320 --> 08:28.580]  There you go.
[08:28.820 --> 08:30.800]  Eternal Darkness feels sconce-y.
[08:31.640 --> 08:32.320]  To your left.
[08:33.440 --> 08:35.900]  I was just thinking of how pissed I would be if I was...
[08:35.900 --> 08:36.560]  Oh, you're already...
[08:36.560 --> 08:40.940]  If I was bleeding a lot and I was like in pain on the ground and someone just started praying over me.
[08:42.120 --> 08:43.060]  Like, do something!
[08:43.720 --> 08:44.840]  Master Chief, are you in here?
[08:44.960 --> 08:45.440]  Push the wound!
[08:45.520 --> 08:48.080]  Yeah, but if it was on the reverse side, you'd say, what do you want me to heal?
[08:49.000 --> 08:49.180]  Yeah.
[08:49.800 --> 08:52.040]  I thought that this was an odd choice when I played this yesterday,
[08:52.200 --> 08:55.620]  that they make you play up to this point and then they give you melee.
[08:56.280 --> 09:00.360]  Like, I don't know why I could have just started with the glove three minutes ago, but...
[09:00.360 --> 09:02.620]  I think they want you to get a feel for the gun.
[09:02.660 --> 09:06.060]  Yeah, they're like slowly building the shield and then the gun.
[09:06.420 --> 09:06.620]  Yeah.
[09:06.820 --> 09:08.600]  I'm amazed at how many weapons there are in this game.
[09:08.600 --> 09:12.140]  I don't want to use the gun because this fucking shield and melee are awesome.
[09:12.480 --> 09:14.000]  Yeah, I really love it.
[09:14.060 --> 09:15.140]  I'm a punchy little fella.
[09:16.060 --> 09:16.660]  So far.
[09:16.780 --> 09:18.860]  I love that this game has, like, reverse fall damage,
[09:18.940 --> 09:21.520]  where if you fall, you attack everybody on impact.
[09:21.660 --> 09:24.940]  Like, just the landing, because you're so heavy, creates a shockwave.
[09:25.040 --> 09:25.500]  Oh, that's cool.
[09:25.600 --> 09:25.880]  It's great.
[09:26.580 --> 09:27.400]  It's really cool.
[09:28.920 --> 09:29.700]  Come on, dickhead.
[09:31.060 --> 09:32.420]  I gotta get this fucking...
[09:32.420 --> 09:32.820]  His ribs!
[09:32.920 --> 09:33.500]  His ribs are out!
[09:33.560 --> 09:34.360]  Andrew, look where his ribs are!
[09:35.080 --> 09:36.360]  Oh, let me take notes!
[09:37.340 --> 09:39.280]  You need to pick up those power fists.
[09:39.400 --> 09:40.980]  It really wants me to...
[09:41.980 --> 09:43.140]  It really wants me to...
[09:43.140 --> 09:43.440]  Okay, never mind.
[09:44.320 --> 09:46.420]  I really want to get rid of this fucking melee combo.
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.740]  You gotta do it twice to...
[09:49.740 --> 09:50.160]  Okay, there we go.
[09:50.280 --> 09:50.400]  Yeah.
[09:50.480 --> 09:50.760]  Nice.
[09:51.800 --> 09:54.320]  I hate when they just litter your fucking screen with nonsense.
[09:55.500 --> 09:57.060]  Yeah, it's a lot at the beginning of the...
[09:57.060 --> 09:57.760]  Oh, I didn't even see these.
[09:57.760 --> 09:58.880]  Oh, I didn't notice them.
[09:59.400 --> 09:59.960]  Is that Brad Pitt?
[10:00.540 --> 10:01.940]  Keep our eyes open for these, dude.
[10:02.000 --> 10:02.340]  I'm that guy.
[10:02.360 --> 10:02.380]  Ah!
[10:02.820 --> 10:03.540]  Dude, come on!
[10:03.580 --> 10:04.460]  I'm looking at your sign!
[10:04.460 --> 10:07.240]  You guys put this up, here's your sign.
[10:07.280 --> 10:08.340]  Those are Hell's Most Wanted.
[10:09.580 --> 10:10.720]  Jesus Christ, man.
[10:11.520 --> 10:12.600]  I'm on your side here.
[10:14.480 --> 10:16.980]  Would Hell's Most Wanted be really good people?
[10:17.840 --> 10:18.080]  Yeah.
[10:18.260 --> 10:18.580]  Oh, yeah.
[10:19.520 --> 10:22.220]  I guess that opened up that, so I can get that.
[10:22.340 --> 10:23.980]  Real Keanu Reeves, Constantine.
[10:24.940 --> 10:26.580]  This person has an orphanage.
[10:26.860 --> 10:27.260]  Wanted.
[10:27.480 --> 10:28.660]  That was such a good movie.
[10:28.680 --> 10:29.660]  It was so good!
[10:29.880 --> 10:30.600]  I'm so disappointed they didn't make a sequel.
[10:31.040 --> 10:35.640]  Why do- I've been hearing about Constantine so much, like, the last couple weeks.
[10:35.740 --> 10:37.480]  Great comic book, great movie.
[10:38.220 --> 10:39.900]  Elyse just kept talking to me about it.
[10:40.280 --> 10:42.120]  TV show was whatever, but...
[10:42.520 --> 10:45.120]  I remember a guy drowning, but he couldn't drink.
[10:45.240 --> 10:46.540]  And then I remember, like, a bugman.
[10:46.940 --> 10:47.340]  Yeah.
[10:47.560 --> 10:48.660]  A bugman.
[10:48.840 --> 10:50.380]  And, uh, what's his name?
[10:51.260 --> 10:52.580]  Shia LaBeouf is a cab driver.
[10:52.780 --> 10:53.200]  Oh, yeah!
[10:53.680 --> 10:53.880]  Yeah!
[10:57.700 --> 10:58.600]  What do you got going on?
[10:58.620 --> 10:59.920]  Is Michelle Monaghan in that movie, too?
[10:59.920 --> 11:00.400]  Monaghan?
[11:01.340 --> 11:02.520]  Oh, dude, I can't remember.
[11:02.520 --> 11:05.960]  But very briefly, I guess they cut, like, a large portion of her role out of it.
[11:06.640 --> 11:07.540]  Peter Storm here, isn't it?
[11:07.700 --> 11:09.080]  Dude, he's the best devil.
[11:09.360 --> 11:10.020]  That's so cool.
[11:10.060 --> 11:10.820]  Best devil.
[11:12.440 --> 11:13.000]  Draft idea.
[11:13.180 --> 11:13.800]  Alright, Geoff, you got this.
[11:13.860 --> 11:14.220]  Draft idea.
[11:14.300 --> 11:15.060]  Alright, Geoff, fight time.
[11:15.520 --> 11:16.800]  Uh, that's a point of no return.
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.040]  Here, I can still return.
[11:18.200 --> 11:20.440]  Like, if I wanted to, I could go down- I could just do it all over again.
[11:20.880 --> 11:21.760]  You could, it's true.
[11:22.020 --> 11:22.700]  You could return.
[11:23.000 --> 11:23.500]  Should we do it-
[11:23.500 --> 11:24.600]  I could go down here, see what-
[11:24.600 --> 11:25.420]  That doesn't seem good.
[11:25.420 --> 11:27.440]  Should we do a draft of best devil?
[11:29.360 --> 11:30.480]  Oh, devil draft?
[11:30.820 --> 11:31.640]  Yeah, devil depiction.
[11:35.910 --> 11:36.670]  Are there enough?
[11:37.770 --> 11:38.770]  Yeah, we were just talking about-
[11:38.770 --> 11:39.330]  I was thinking that too.
[11:39.610 --> 11:40.790]  That Tim Curry one, what's that one?
[11:41.190 --> 11:42.010]  Yeah, uh, legend.
[11:42.650 --> 11:43.590]  Whoop, labyrinth's the other one.
[11:44.570 --> 11:45.370]  That's a good one.
[11:45.930 --> 11:46.530]  It's a good devil.
[11:47.470 --> 11:47.650]  Yeah.
[11:48.510 --> 11:48.970]  Do it!
[11:51.370 --> 11:52.310]  God, they just-
[11:52.310 --> 11:52.810]  Oh, shit!
[11:52.910 --> 11:54.310]  They just get goo'd.
[11:54.710 --> 11:55.430]  It's so cool.
[11:55.910 --> 11:57.130]  It's, uh-
[11:57.130 --> 11:59.550]  I love how many, like, weak little guys they throw at you.
[11:59.550 --> 12:01.090]  You just mow through them.
[12:01.130 --> 12:03.350]  You just got a monster in this thing.
[12:05.670 --> 12:06.470]  So cool.
[12:08.170 --> 12:10.410]  It gets pretty hairy after a while, though.
[12:10.790 --> 12:11.110]  Oh, yeah.
[12:12.110 --> 12:15.390]  You gotta chain combos, and then you get health and shields from that.
[12:15.470 --> 12:15.810]  It's great.
[12:16.090 --> 12:17.950]  So how far are you into this, Andrew?
[12:18.710 --> 12:20.230]  I think I'm in, like, chapter nine.
[12:20.850 --> 12:21.630]  Jesus Christ.
[12:24.030 --> 12:26.130]  Once again, questioning why I'm playing.
[12:27.010 --> 12:28.030]  Because I wanted to see you play!
[12:28.370 --> 12:28.770]  Okay.
[12:29.910 --> 12:30.990]  Yeah, on Pandemonium.
[12:31.650 --> 12:31.890]  Yeah.
[12:32.870 --> 12:37.530]  So now that you got the gist of it, and showed us the gist of it, let's go back to the start.
[12:37.810 --> 12:39.010]  Let's Pandemonium it up.
[12:39.030 --> 12:39.190]  Yeah!
[12:39.950 --> 12:41.610]  I've already-
[12:43.530 --> 12:45.270]  Andrew, what difficulty did you do on?
[12:45.850 --> 12:46.610]  Hurt Me Plenty.
[12:47.170 --> 12:47.630]  Is that this one?
[12:48.370 --> 12:49.250]  It's one more than this.
[12:49.450 --> 12:49.850]  Oh, it is?
[12:50.370 --> 12:50.930]  It's the same.
[12:51.230 --> 12:51.950]  They're normal.
[12:54.070 --> 12:55.750]  I, uh, I no longer-
[12:55.750 --> 12:59.150]  With the exception of Halo, I no longer feel the need to play stuff on the hardest difficulty.
[12:59.590 --> 13:00.810]  No, not at all.
[13:01.050 --> 13:01.950]  I don't get that.
[13:02.250 --> 13:04.710]  I don't get the satisfaction from it anymore.
[13:05.250 --> 13:09.390]  I always try and put it one below the highest, because my skill level is never the best.
[13:10.830 --> 13:13.250]  It's just not compatible with the highest on most games.
[13:13.470 --> 13:14.010]  Like, God of War?
[13:14.110 --> 13:14.550]  God, no.
[13:15.070 --> 13:15.430]  Right.
[13:16.070 --> 13:17.170]  Like, Give Me God of War?
[13:17.210 --> 13:17.590]  Impossible.
[13:17.790 --> 13:23.670]  I haven't done Give Me God of War on the original 2018 one, but I did do it on Ragnarok.
[13:24.870 --> 13:25.950]  You did it on Ragnarok?
[13:26.490 --> 13:26.890]  Yeah.
[13:27.570 --> 13:28.070]  You serious?
[13:28.210 --> 13:28.370]  Yeah.
[13:28.430 --> 13:29.330]  The first playthrough?
[13:29.550 --> 13:30.370]  No, God, no.
[13:30.490 --> 13:31.090]  No, no, no, no.
[13:31.090 --> 13:31.210]  Oh.
[13:31.430 --> 13:31.770]  No, no, no.
[13:31.770 --> 13:32.390]  You went back for it?
[13:32.510 --> 13:32.850]  No, no, no.
[13:32.850 --> 13:35.090]  Yeah, I started on hard on the regular playthrough.
[13:35.570 --> 13:41.010]  Yeah, if I go straight in on the top difficulty, levels take me so long I forget the story.
[13:41.950 --> 13:42.230]  Yeah.
[13:48.130 --> 13:50.090]  I just don't have anything to prove anymore.
[13:50.370 --> 13:50.910]  You know what I mean?
[13:51.110 --> 13:51.990]  You've proved it all.
[13:52.190 --> 13:53.350]  You left it all out on the battlefield.
[13:53.430 --> 13:55.030]  I have, like, a job and, like, a mortgage.
[13:55.030 --> 13:59.850]  Like, I don't have time to have to prove that I can beat this on, like, a harder difficulty.
[14:00.050 --> 14:00.890]  I just don't.
[14:01.010 --> 14:02.310]  I just have no interest in that.
[14:02.670 --> 14:03.270]  I have a mortgage.
[14:03.430 --> 14:04.070]  I'm not doing this.
[14:04.830 --> 14:05.970]  Yeah, that's how I feel.
[14:06.210 --> 14:08.210]  I have fucking bills to pay here.
[14:08.350 --> 14:11.310]  When you die, like, the 80th time to a Valkyrie in God of War,
[14:11.770 --> 14:14.290]  just because you put it on, like, such a hard difficulty and you just go, like,
[14:14.310 --> 14:16.230]  I have bills to pay.
[14:16.290 --> 14:17.770]  I don't have time for this, like...
[14:17.770 --> 14:20.770]  I was one frame late to that block and now she's stood on my neck again.
[14:20.830 --> 14:20.970]  Yep, yep.
[14:21.150 --> 14:21.330]  Oh.
[14:21.450 --> 14:21.930]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:22.710 --> 14:22.910]  Yeah.
[14:23.170 --> 14:24.250]  I can't show my wife this.
[14:24.250 --> 14:29.010]  I had two really difficult boss fights in Ragnarok that took me forever.
[14:29.210 --> 14:31.290]  Yeah, it's like the King of the Berserkers and then
[14:31.890 --> 14:34.270]  the Queen of the Valkyries at the very end.
[14:34.390 --> 14:34.790]  Oh, yeah.
[14:35.850 --> 14:38.990]  I was, I feel like I was struggling with those both equally.
[14:39.210 --> 14:41.050]  And then I just back to back them right at the end,
[14:41.150 --> 14:42.590]  because I guess it was just powerful enough.
[14:42.650 --> 14:42.830]  Yeah.
[14:44.370 --> 14:45.150]  Look who's back.
[14:45.410 --> 14:46.050]  Back to back.
[14:46.130 --> 14:46.950]  They're hard fights, though.
[14:48.110 --> 14:50.610]  I enjoy in this game whenever you have to find a key,
[14:50.670 --> 14:53.190]  because it's one of the Doom Slayers, the most relatable to me.
[14:53.190 --> 14:53.910]  It's me.
[14:54.050 --> 14:55.930]  I feel, Andrew, I felt the same way.
[14:56.130 --> 14:57.670]  Just like this guy being like,
[14:57.790 --> 14:58.850]  Fuck, where I put this?
[14:59.130 --> 14:59.250]  Yeah.
[14:59.250 --> 15:00.090]  Me and this guy.
[15:00.350 --> 15:02.610]  Well, I guess the only thing that both of you could do.
[15:03.130 --> 15:03.390]  Yeah.
[15:03.410 --> 15:04.210]  Yeah, I guess.
[15:04.350 --> 15:06.950]  Yeah, I've never done anything else but what,
[15:07.810 --> 15:09.370]  that's the alignment for me and the Doom Slayer.
[15:10.670 --> 15:11.930]  Well, he's got to eat at some point.
[15:13.670 --> 15:14.810]  You know what, I don't see it.
[15:15.010 --> 15:15.110]  True.
[15:15.250 --> 15:16.650]  Yeah, yeah, you definitely don't see it.
[15:17.250 --> 15:20.550]  Yeah, I feel closer to Master Chief if I just watched him eat a sandwich or something.
[15:22.810 --> 15:24.810]  I couldn't imagine this guy eating, to be honest.
[15:24.810 --> 15:26.730]  Just his helmet up, just covering his nose and above with his mouth open,
[15:26.870 --> 15:29.010]  just fucking chomping on a bologna sandwich.
[15:30.270 --> 15:31.870]  Master Chief likes Master Beef.
[15:32.610 --> 15:33.910]  I assume he got fed through a pipe.
[15:34.090 --> 15:34.250]  Oh.
[15:34.250 --> 15:35.670]  I think he just snacks through his mouth.
[15:37.350 --> 15:38.090]  Master Chief?
[15:38.550 --> 15:38.750]  Yeah.
[15:39.930 --> 15:41.190]  It is a small helmet, though.
[15:43.230 --> 15:46.710]  Would be interesting to see a hot dog off between Master Chief and the Doom Slayer.
[15:48.890 --> 15:50.310]  Two big dudes in armor.
[15:51.310 --> 15:54.590]  Like, who's the true Joey Chestnut of FPSes?
[15:55.250 --> 16:00.090]  If there was a version of Death Battle that was just how they did regular mundane things.
[16:00.650 --> 16:01.270]  Pretty cool.
[16:01.770 --> 16:02.450]  Dog battle.
[16:02.850 --> 16:06.090]  Do they think I'm missing here before I move on?
[16:06.350 --> 16:07.270]  No, I don't think so.
[16:07.370 --> 16:11.290]  What I really like about this is that when you walk into structures and stuff,
[16:11.390 --> 16:13.070]  usually it's like, oh, you got to shoot stuff, whatever.
[16:13.270 --> 16:17.870]  You just walk into structures and they just crumble at you.
[16:18.010 --> 16:18.910]  I think it's so cool.
[16:19.410 --> 16:20.790]  You're just like such a monster.
[16:21.450 --> 16:22.030]  Oh, right.
[16:22.090 --> 16:22.930]  This little asshole.
[16:23.390 --> 16:27.130]  So this is the version of Pinky, apparently, that's in this game.
[16:29.950 --> 16:30.330]  Yeah.
[16:34.050 --> 16:35.230]  Oh, it does look like it.
[16:35.270 --> 16:35.830]  It's so cool.
[16:35.890 --> 16:38.030]  The dismemberment of... you just shot his horn off.
[16:38.210 --> 16:38.870]  Like, damn!
[16:39.030 --> 16:41.570]  Yeah, his head looks pretty empty towards the end there.
[16:41.690 --> 16:42.230]  No mercy.
[16:42.890 --> 16:44.170]  Not a lot of thots going on.
[16:45.890 --> 16:47.770]  Like, uh, I don't know.
[16:47.770 --> 16:50.130]  Just, like, the takes on, like, the old Doom stuff,
[16:50.250 --> 16:51.970]  but, like, in this setting, I think is really interesting.
[16:52.270 --> 16:56.350]  Have they remade an old Doom, like, an original Doom map in the new graphics?
[16:57.670 --> 16:59.270]  Oh, I don't know if they have.
[17:00.150 --> 17:02.970]  I find it so hard to distinguish those old maps.
[17:03.490 --> 17:03.730]  Yeah.
[17:04.510 --> 17:05.590]  What are these guys doing?
[17:05.630 --> 17:10.230]  I like that none of them have taken the time to notice what's happening around them.
[17:10.230 --> 17:10.390]  Yeah.
[17:10.870 --> 17:12.750]  Then this will stop now, right?
[17:12.870 --> 17:13.310]  If I kill them?
[17:13.490 --> 17:13.910]  You would think.
[17:14.030 --> 17:15.150]  No, not this one.
[17:16.010 --> 17:16.630]  The key.
[17:18.270 --> 17:19.410]  There you go, just like Andrew.
[17:20.210 --> 17:20.710]  That's, yeah.
[17:20.810 --> 17:21.010]  Wow.
[17:21.550 --> 17:24.330]  I'm always leaving it on the dead bodies around me.
[17:24.410 --> 17:25.290]  It's so embarrassing.
[17:25.970 --> 17:27.010]  Stomach gone, key remains.
[17:27.010 --> 17:27.970]  That's not where that goes.
[17:28.090 --> 17:28.190]  Oh boy!
[17:29.650 --> 17:30.650]  And then, of course, it wants me.
[17:30.870 --> 17:33.930]  I so wish that there was a door that I needed to go through that way with.
[17:33.990 --> 17:36.310]  It wants me to go there, but I'm gonna go back,
[17:36.570 --> 17:38.390]  because there was another door over here.
[17:41.410 --> 17:43.030]  Oh, I missed this.
[17:43.190 --> 17:44.230]  Somebody's got a secret.
[17:44.770 --> 17:45.490]  Good work.
[17:45.770 --> 17:45.810]  Collectible.
[17:46.650 --> 17:48.270]  You got a little toy, you got the imp.
[17:49.610 --> 17:50.330]  I'm impish.
[17:50.690 --> 17:51.290]  All imps are.
[17:51.310 --> 17:52.670]  You are, that's how I would describe you.
[17:52.870 --> 17:53.030]  Thank you.
[17:53.030 --> 17:53.890]  An adjective for Geoff.
[17:54.090 --> 17:54.470]  Thank you.
[17:57.130 --> 17:58.870]  You guys, just wait, yeah.
[17:59.130 --> 18:00.810]  What are the chances you go through the door with me?
[18:02.150 --> 18:02.870]  That's what I thought.
[18:03.350 --> 18:04.370]  Do you, do they ever run?
[18:04.970 --> 18:05.590]  Do they ever fight?
[18:06.490 --> 18:06.670]  Yeah.
[18:06.730 --> 18:07.790]  No, they mostly just cower.
[18:07.970 --> 18:08.490]  They're useless.
[18:08.870 --> 18:09.450]  Oblivion gate.
[18:09.990 --> 18:10.130]  Oh.
[18:11.750 --> 18:14.270]  There's one scenario I've seen where they fight.
[18:15.190 --> 18:15.510]  That's cool.
[18:15.590 --> 18:18.310]  One thing I always liked about Halo is that the Marines would come with you.
[18:19.250 --> 18:21.470]  And I always made it my personal goal to keep them alive.
[18:21.970 --> 18:24.730]  Not when you play with Gavin, they don't, because he kills them immediately.
[18:25.110 --> 18:27.450]  Well, in Halo 1, you couldn't switch guns with them, and so I just took them.
[18:27.990 --> 18:28.310]  Oh.
[18:29.570 --> 18:30.610]  You're a bastard, man.
[18:31.190 --> 18:31.590]  Oh, yeah.
[18:34.810 --> 18:36.330]  Just like Geoff said at the start of this video.
[18:43.010 --> 18:44.370]  So what are we recording?
[18:46.810 --> 18:48.770]  I don't know why you don't know why I was confused.
[18:48.970 --> 18:49.810]  So the Discord then.
[18:51.750 --> 18:53.530]  I pulled out OBS, I went to record it.
[18:53.550 --> 18:54.510]  I was like, oh wait, I'm not in the game.
[18:54.570 --> 18:55.190]  I can't do a backup.
[18:55.330 --> 18:55.950]  Do you mean the Discord?
[18:56.230 --> 18:56.350]  No.
[18:57.450 --> 19:03.010]  All I said was, can somebody record a backup of my video so that in case my video crashes?
[19:03.550 --> 19:05.830]  I was just moving my mouse around like, wait, what am I doing?
[19:08.170 --> 19:08.770]  Being annoying?
[19:10.130 --> 19:11.350]  Can I help you, idiot?
[19:14.310 --> 19:15.350]  Don't yell at me.
[19:15.430 --> 19:16.270]  I'm not the annoying one.
[19:16.850 --> 19:18.270]  Oh, I apologize.
[19:21.430 --> 19:21.750]  Nope.
[19:25.930 --> 19:27.970]  Oh, that's a tough one.
[19:28.010 --> 19:28.690]  I got low health.
[19:28.790 --> 19:29.190]  Yeah, you do.
[19:32.730 --> 19:33.950]  You need some of them shields.
[19:34.610 --> 19:36.470]  Go kill some guys so you get some health.
[19:37.210 --> 19:38.770]  Oh, God, you're running into a wall.
[19:39.330 --> 19:39.910]  Oh, fuck.
[19:40.130 --> 19:41.530]  I don't have my spinny shield yet.
[19:41.830 --> 19:42.610]  Oh, fuck.
[19:42.710 --> 19:43.650]  I need a spin shield.
[19:45.190 --> 19:47.710]  I don't want to go up there yet.
[19:48.130 --> 19:50.310]  You were almost killed by future usabilities.
[19:52.550 --> 19:54.350]  I don't want to go over there yet.
[19:54.770 --> 19:55.970]  There's so many people to fight.
[19:56.470 --> 19:58.470]  Just turn away from that round coming at you.
[19:58.470 --> 19:58.710]  Kill this guy.
[19:59.130 --> 19:59.770]  Get him, get him.
[20:04.550 --> 20:05.590]  You missed the goal.
[20:07.430 --> 20:08.250]  I'm out of guns.
[20:08.350 --> 20:08.890]  You're out of bullets.
[20:09.010 --> 20:09.650]  You got to kill something.
[20:10.130 --> 20:10.650]  I'm out of bullets.
[20:10.830 --> 20:11.370]  God damn it.
[20:14.170 --> 20:15.330]  Throw your shield at the...
[20:15.870 --> 20:16.790]  I can't throw my shield yet.
[20:16.930 --> 20:17.610]  Oh, you can't.
[20:18.710 --> 20:20.070]  Insane for going this way.
[20:20.850 --> 20:21.430]  Oh, no.
[20:25.590 --> 20:26.310]  Shield charge.
[20:28.230 --> 20:29.470]  I forgot about that.
[20:32.050 --> 20:33.790]  It's the only thing you use.
[20:34.030 --> 20:34.490]  Turn around, turn around.
[20:34.810 --> 20:35.090]  Yeah, all right.
[20:35.190 --> 20:35.390]  I'm good.
[20:36.570 --> 20:37.450]  You said that.
[20:37.590 --> 20:38.330]  I was like, what does he beat?
[20:38.490 --> 20:39.990]  Oh, all right.
[20:39.990 --> 20:41.390]  Oh, there you go.
[20:41.630 --> 20:42.070]  A life sigil.
[20:43.570 --> 20:45.390]  When you die, it'll bring you back.
[20:45.510 --> 20:46.290]  Just like I planned.
[20:46.650 --> 20:46.830]  Yeah.
[20:47.170 --> 20:49.730]  I don't plan on dying, though.
[20:50.990 --> 20:51.170]  Okay.
[20:52.870 --> 20:54.870]  Yeah, too good to die.
[20:56.430 --> 20:57.690]  There you go.
[21:01.700 --> 21:02.500]  There you go.
[21:03.660 --> 21:07.520]  Now you're playing the game the way that it wants you to.
[21:07.680 --> 21:08.680]  And it's rewarding you.
[21:09.180 --> 21:09.480]  Sweet.
[21:11.660 --> 21:13.680]  That was the worst shield use I've ever seen.
[21:16.580 --> 21:18.400]  And that guy probably been carrying that for ages.
[21:18.420 --> 21:20.300]  He wasn't ready for my advanced tactics.
[21:20.980 --> 21:21.320]  It's true.
[21:21.360 --> 21:22.740]  He's like, finally, out of hell.
[21:23.280 --> 21:24.600]  Oh, Christ.
[21:24.600 --> 21:25.420]  There you go, you closed the gate.
[21:25.680 --> 21:25.960]  Hey!
[21:26.860 --> 21:28.120]  Tamriel is safe once again.
[21:32.680 --> 21:35.240]  Man, we're in a great period of video games right now.
[21:35.340 --> 21:35.820]  Dude, really.
[21:35.820 --> 21:36.320]  Oh, it's so good.
[21:36.620 --> 21:37.360]  There is so much.
[21:37.400 --> 21:39.740]  I was playing Dredge about five minutes before I jumped on with you guys.
[21:39.780 --> 21:40.560]  Still not done with that.
[21:40.560 --> 21:43.720]  There's so much good fucking stuff on Game Pass right now.
[21:44.300 --> 21:44.640]  It's Dredge.
[21:44.740 --> 21:45.260]  What is Dredge?
[21:45.380 --> 21:45.840]  The boat one.
[21:46.260 --> 21:48.840]  It's the Team 17 single-player boat game, yeah.
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.180]  I'll give that a go.
[21:50.720 --> 21:51.580]  Where do I want to go?
[21:52.600 --> 21:54.760]  You got to go back up and kill the pinky.
[21:55.880 --> 21:57.180]  I want to pick up blueprints again.
[21:58.080 --> 21:58.820]  There's like two different...
[21:58.820 --> 21:59.860]  Yeah, I need to finish that.
[22:00.540 --> 22:01.660]  I got distracted with all this.
[22:03.220 --> 22:06.240]  Gavin's been texting me blueprints updates and always makes me so happy.
[22:06.720 --> 22:07.040]  Every day.
[22:07.500 --> 22:09.480]  I can't waste any more time playing blueprints.
[22:09.600 --> 22:10.200]  Today's the day.
[22:10.200 --> 22:12.240]  Then I get no closer to being it.
[22:12.460 --> 22:13.080]  That's awesome.
[22:13.460 --> 22:15.660]  I don't have the purple key yet, right?
[22:16.120 --> 22:17.840]  Nope, you got to keep looking around.
[22:18.040 --> 22:18.460]  Tomorrow's the day.
[22:19.040 --> 22:21.500]  I can't get into that until I have the...
[22:21.500 --> 22:22.860]  Maybe today's the day.
[22:23.200 --> 22:24.320]  Oh yeah, it's over here, isn't it?
[22:26.780 --> 22:27.500]  Oh, nice.
[22:33.340 --> 22:38.480]  When you do that shield charge, to me it feels like landing a giant tackle in the NFL.
[22:38.700 --> 22:41.520]  The feeling I get watching that, but it's a first person.
[22:43.480 --> 22:44.480]  Fuck over here for a bit.
[22:45.020 --> 22:46.580]  Sound design in this game is so good.
[22:47.000 --> 22:47.360]  It's great.
[22:48.940 --> 22:51.680]  The music for all these Doom games are so sick.
[22:51.780 --> 22:52.120]  Oh yeah.
[22:53.100 --> 22:55.040]  I got my codex.
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.600]  Living life to the fullest now.
[23:00.540 --> 23:02.200]  As I go back down the way I came.
[23:03.680 --> 23:05.100]  Oh, hey, what's going on down there?
[23:05.200 --> 23:05.560]  Is that fine?
[23:05.720 --> 23:05.880]  Yeah.
[23:07.360 --> 23:11.100]  Got a little scared I was gonna run off that edge of the world.
[23:11.840 --> 23:12.240]  See you.
[23:13.480 --> 23:16.340]  Even if you run off the side, I don't think it takes any damage.
[23:16.900 --> 23:17.860]  Fuck around here for a bit.
[23:18.620 --> 23:21.220]  Yeah, it lets you just sort of come back.
[23:21.720 --> 23:22.300]  That's nice.
[23:27.300 --> 23:28.100]  Hell yeah.
[23:28.300 --> 23:28.820]  What is this?
[23:29.000 --> 23:29.240]  All right.
[23:31.900 --> 23:32.300]  Shredder.
[23:32.820 --> 23:34.560]  I can't believe you never played these games, Nick.
[23:34.600 --> 23:35.260]  You're crazy, dude.
[23:35.680 --> 23:36.520]  I think you'd really like them.
[23:37.400 --> 23:38.480]  They're really good.
[23:39.860 --> 23:42.600]  Yeah, start with that first one.
[23:43.480 --> 23:45.560]  And then play the second one.
[23:45.680 --> 23:47.840]  Then play this because they're worth your time.
[23:49.220 --> 23:50.060]  They look fun.
[23:50.940 --> 23:51.660]  They're great.
[23:54.120 --> 23:58.880]  I would say that the closest game I played to this would be like one of the old Serious Sam games.
[24:00.120 --> 24:01.600]  Oh, yeah, dude.
[24:02.120 --> 24:02.920]  It's pretty good.
[24:03.680 --> 24:05.640]  I think if you go right, Geoff, you can get the secret key.
[24:06.460 --> 24:06.740]  Up here?
[24:07.780 --> 24:09.920]  Yeah, and then take a left.
[24:14.580 --> 24:16.600]  Unless you kill these guys, you can go across.
[24:17.280 --> 24:17.520]  Yeah.
[24:18.240 --> 24:19.800]  I think you knocked his shoulder off.
[24:21.240 --> 24:22.740]  He didn't need that shoulder.
[24:22.900 --> 24:23.060]  I'll teach him.
[24:30.290 --> 24:34.650]  Have you gotten far enough, Geoff, to experience like some of the other ways you play this game?
[24:35.750 --> 24:36.690]  I don't know what that means.
[24:38.170 --> 24:39.850]  The fuck does that mean?
[24:40.750 --> 24:41.850]  Have you not either, Eric?
[24:42.270 --> 24:42.870]  Like in the back?
[24:43.070 --> 24:43.610]  Other modes.
[24:43.990 --> 24:45.610]  I'm at like the very beginning of level two.
[24:46.170 --> 24:46.550]  Okay.
[24:47.090 --> 24:47.250]  I don't know what that means.
[24:47.250 --> 24:48.570]  I started it like an hour.
[24:48.650 --> 24:50.110]  I made like a cup of coffee and sat down with it.
[24:50.190 --> 24:50.430]  Go right.
[24:50.750 --> 24:53.810]  I beat level two, so that's as far as I've gone.
[24:57.550 --> 24:59.010]  That's a big-ass key.
[25:02.790 --> 25:03.890]  I'm just showing it to you.
[25:03.950 --> 25:06.670]  I'm very curious about what you mean about other ways to play this game.
[25:08.110 --> 25:08.830]  Like backwards?
[25:09.370 --> 25:09.730]  Blindfolded?
[25:10.250 --> 25:10.610]  Yeah, right.
[25:10.870 --> 25:14.310]  It turns into Pacific Rim.
[25:15.730 --> 25:16.290]  Oh, really?
[25:16.490 --> 25:16.970]  That's cool.
[25:17.250 --> 25:19.850]  Yeah, you get into a giant mech Doom Slayer.
[25:19.890 --> 25:20.290]  What the fuck?
[25:20.690 --> 25:21.350]  Oh, that's cool.
[25:23.570 --> 25:24.350]  It's awesome.
[25:25.750 --> 25:28.450]  It's probably like the next level for both of you.
[25:29.330 --> 25:30.010]  It's very early on.
[25:34.270 --> 25:35.230]  Okay, uh...
[25:35.230 --> 25:36.130]  Yeah, one more Doom portal.
[25:36.190 --> 25:36.910]  Oh, the ping system.
[25:39.190 --> 25:40.150]  Is it this way?
[25:42.730 --> 25:44.130]  You open that door?
[25:44.230 --> 25:44.910]  Sounds so imposing.
[25:44.910 --> 25:46.170]  Yeah, this is when you get this door.
[25:47.350 --> 25:48.890]  The thump, thump, thump.
[25:49.070 --> 25:49.650]  Wait, not this one.
[25:49.690 --> 25:52.350]  Where's the purple door?
[25:53.010 --> 25:53.690]  I think it's right there.
[25:53.810 --> 25:53.990]  Right there.
[25:58.620 --> 26:00.120]  Nice church bell in the background.
[26:01.500 --> 26:03.820]  Do you want to get the other secret here?
[26:04.020 --> 26:04.700]  Yeah, where is it?
[26:05.240 --> 26:05.960]  Go right.
[26:07.660 --> 26:08.560]  And go down that way, yeah.
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.100]  And then go through that door.
[26:13.460 --> 26:13.860]  Okay, right.
[26:14.240 --> 26:14.800]  Yeah, go through that.
[26:18.560 --> 26:20.000]  And then go straight back from where you are.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.100]  Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[26:21.220 --> 26:21.620]  Straight back.
[26:21.780 --> 26:22.380]  Keep going, straight back.
[26:22.520 --> 26:23.840]  Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[26:23.980 --> 26:24.320]  Look down.
[26:25.620 --> 26:26.200]  Hop down there.
[26:27.040 --> 26:28.160]  Oh, I did not find this one.
[26:28.260 --> 26:29.060]  I think I just did it.
[26:29.280 --> 26:30.400]  Oh, wow.
[26:30.700 --> 26:31.700]  That was a cool one there.
[26:31.920 --> 26:32.660]  Good catch.
[26:33.860 --> 26:38.100]  I just remember this is how the last Doom game felt, where it was always there was something below you.
[26:38.500 --> 26:38.720]  Yep.
[26:40.500 --> 26:41.560]  Yeah, I think that's it here.
[26:41.560 --> 26:42.400]  I could just fucking live here.
[26:42.660 --> 26:43.540]  Yeah, it's fucking crazy.
[26:43.660 --> 26:45.020]  No, never mind, I know where I am.
[26:46.320 --> 26:49.940]  Shit, like this is exactly why I'm just hugging walls in The Last of Us.
[26:50.460 --> 26:51.700]  Constantly, just to find shit.
[26:51.820 --> 26:52.140]  Yeah.
[26:52.980 --> 26:54.220]  That's how you find all the MILFs.
[26:54.340 --> 26:54.620]  It's a cable.
[26:55.500 --> 26:56.100]  They're all there.
[26:56.200 --> 26:57.040]  Some of them come to find me.
[26:57.300 --> 26:58.220]  MILFs, Nick loves MILFs.
[26:58.240 --> 26:59.480]  Right, and they come to find me too.
[27:01.520 --> 27:03.320]  In the game, in the context of the game.
[27:03.780 --> 27:04.360]  I'm gonna tell your wife.
[27:04.840 --> 27:06.680]  In the context of the game.
[27:06.980 --> 27:09.260]  Do you play on a Give Me MILFs difficulty?
[27:11.800 --> 27:14.120]  We'll have to start streaming Give Me MILFs difficulty again.
[27:15.720 --> 27:16.860]  Give me MILF.
[27:17.940 --> 27:18.740]  What was over here?
[27:19.240 --> 27:19.620]  There we go.
[27:19.620 --> 27:21.820]  That's where he came from, but there's like armor in here, I think.
[27:23.380 --> 27:25.860]  That title of that video got demonetized, by the way.
[27:26.660 --> 27:27.020]  No.
[27:27.840 --> 27:29.180]  Oh, you know what else got demonetized?
[27:29.300 --> 27:30.340]  Something else we played recently.
[27:30.500 --> 27:30.620]  Oh.
[27:31.980 --> 27:32.680]  The autopsy thing?
[27:32.760 --> 27:32.900]  What was it?
[27:33.280 --> 27:34.280]  Yeah, autopsy simulator.
[27:34.280 --> 27:34.620]  What was?
[27:34.900 --> 27:35.680]  Immediately demonetized.
[27:35.700 --> 27:36.080]  Oh, because of the cock.
[27:36.320 --> 27:36.680]  Oh.
[27:36.920 --> 27:37.700]  There was cock in it?
[27:38.060 --> 27:38.420]  Probably.
[27:38.880 --> 27:40.080]  It was like a blood, naked, dead body.
[27:40.320 --> 27:41.320]  Oh, yeah.
[27:42.000 --> 27:42.840]  Yeah, there was.
[27:44.640 --> 27:46.780]  Definitely made zero dollars off that one.
[27:46.840 --> 27:49.440]  Yeah, you just don't remember because you were kind of like...
[27:49.440 --> 27:52.320]  I was locked in to not fainting.
[27:53.880 --> 27:54.920]  Get off that fuck.
[27:55.140 --> 27:56.360]  There you go, little bitch.
[27:59.720 --> 28:00.460]  Hell yeah.
[28:03.300 --> 28:05.300]  I'll be honest, the thickness of that door was...
[28:06.040 --> 28:07.980]  I feel like you could have just kicked the shit out of that.
[28:08.320 --> 28:08.680]  Yeah.
[28:10.740 --> 28:12.620]  I wish you could read that.
[28:12.840 --> 28:15.060]  I wish I could like read that or do something with it.
[28:15.700 --> 28:17.540]  That's how I feel when I look at regular books.
[28:21.700 --> 28:23.860]  But you don't say, I wish I could read that.
[28:24.240 --> 28:25.160]  No, I know.
[28:25.280 --> 28:26.560]  Is there anything I need to go back for?
[28:27.020 --> 28:29.120]  I think you missed one area, but it doesn't really matter.
[28:29.160 --> 28:29.620]  I don't give a shit.
[28:30.400 --> 28:30.760]  Exactly.
[28:33.220 --> 28:34.520]  Nice of them to lead you in there.
[28:34.980 --> 28:35.980]  Yeah, there's armor over there.
[28:37.100 --> 28:37.460]  Nice.
[28:42.940 --> 28:43.820]  I'll use the gun.
[28:44.200 --> 28:44.640]  No, never mind.
[28:45.080 --> 28:46.580]  Who's the most injured person in there?
[28:48.060 --> 28:50.120]  Oh, God, that's so cool.
[28:50.560 --> 28:57.260]  Yeah, I sat with him and I watched this fight for like six or seven minutes yesterday just to see if anything happened.
[28:57.300 --> 28:58.700]  It doesn't, you can watch it all day long.
[28:58.860 --> 28:59.580]  They just do this forever.
[28:59.720 --> 29:01.580]  So is the dragon on the human side?
[29:02.960 --> 29:05.560]  I don't, yes, I think so.
[29:05.760 --> 29:07.520]  Or the dude's just near its nest and he's like, fuck this.
[29:07.560 --> 29:13.560]  It might just be a thing where like if wolves fought humans, birds would not have like a side.
[29:13.700 --> 29:15.900]  They would just simply be and like get involved.
[29:16.040 --> 29:16.500]  You know what I mean?
[29:16.600 --> 29:18.180]  And I have a feeling it might be that kind of situation.
[29:18.860 --> 29:19.720]  Defending its home turf.
[29:19.720 --> 29:20.820]  They might just simply be birds.
[29:22.780 --> 29:24.540]  That could use a giant mech suit.
[29:25.640 --> 29:26.440]  That's what I'm saying.
[29:27.280 --> 29:28.740]  Oh, can you pick up that big sword with it?
[29:29.100 --> 29:29.320]  Yeah.
[29:30.340 --> 29:32.040]  This fight, I thought this fight was really cool.
[29:32.780 --> 29:34.740]  It's really cool for so early.
[29:34.880 --> 29:35.620]  It's like really sick.
[29:36.400 --> 29:41.580]  What's fun is when you're in the mech stuff, these guys that seem so big are all of a sudden so tiny.
[29:42.160 --> 29:42.720]  Oh, that's awesome.
[29:43.000 --> 29:43.700]  Walk through them.
[29:44.100 --> 29:47.220]  Yeah, you can just crunch them, walk through buildings.
[29:47.340 --> 29:47.800]  It's awesome.
[29:47.900 --> 29:48.140]  Hell yeah.
[29:50.700 --> 29:51.280]  What was it?
[29:51.380 --> 29:52.600]  Well, it's like King of the Hill.
[29:53.480 --> 29:53.900]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[29:53.980 --> 29:56.460]  What was that MMO game with Star Wars?
[29:56.740 --> 29:57.440]  Hellgates or whatever.
[29:57.580 --> 29:58.820]  Was it Hellgate London or something?
[29:59.460 --> 30:00.140]  Yeah, that was a game.
[30:01.420 --> 30:02.540]  I read the books.
[30:02.580 --> 30:03.220]  The books were interesting.
[30:04.520 --> 30:06.240]  That was one of those games that was supposed to be really good.
[30:06.280 --> 30:07.000]  And then I don't think it was.
[30:07.100 --> 30:08.060]  No, I don't think it ever.
[30:08.320 --> 30:08.460]  Oh, really?
[30:08.700 --> 30:08.920]  Yeah.
[30:13.710 --> 30:13.990]  Hey.
[30:18.110 --> 30:19.170]  The idea was interesting.
[30:19.510 --> 30:20.490]  Lone soldier, one shot.
[30:20.490 --> 30:28.390]  It was like people who got magic, people who could kind of become demon-esque,
[30:28.690 --> 30:32.390]  and then people who had been like church crusaders who had
[30:32.930 --> 30:36.310]  developed all this technology to fight against the Hellgates when they opened.
[30:38.250 --> 30:39.990]  And it was like, oh, this is actually a really interesting...
[30:39.990 --> 30:40.650]  Did you pick a side?
[30:41.190 --> 30:42.670]  Oh, yeah, you can pick one of the three.
[30:42.810 --> 30:45.930]  They're all against the demons on some level, but they don't always work together.
[30:47.070 --> 30:48.850]  And the books, it was interesting to see them come together.
[30:49.190 --> 30:50.090]  But the game sucked.
[30:51.610 --> 30:51.930]  Yeah.
[30:53.270 --> 30:54.130]  Always a heartbreaker.
[30:57.570 --> 31:00.010]  I don't think I've ever said the book is better than the game.
[31:02.470 --> 31:05.670]  I think I have the novelization of Battlefield or something.
[31:05.850 --> 31:07.970]  So like maybe it's that or like Call of Duty.
[31:08.570 --> 31:10.710]  Dude, there's so many Halo books now.
[31:11.490 --> 31:12.450]  Who was the lady that wrote a lot?
[31:12.570 --> 31:13.510]  Karen Travers.
[31:13.610 --> 31:13.970]  Was that her name?
[31:14.010 --> 31:14.610]  She was a good writer.
[31:14.890 --> 31:15.250]  It was cool.
[31:15.450 --> 31:15.770]  Oh, yeah.
[31:16.210 --> 31:17.150]  I think that was her name.
[31:18.530 --> 31:20.090]  Uh, nothing else to do here, right?
[31:20.870 --> 31:22.270]  Uh, no, no, I don't think there is.
[31:22.390 --> 31:23.350]  What the fuck are you?
[31:23.910 --> 31:25.330]  Wow, I didn't even see that before.
[31:25.610 --> 31:26.330]  Oh, it's a PT.
[31:26.590 --> 31:27.730]  That's an evil fish.
[31:27.790 --> 31:28.250]  It's a PT.
[31:31.190 --> 31:33.370]  Is this a new Strand type game?
[31:33.990 --> 31:34.430]  Oh, shit.
[31:36.070 --> 31:36.970]  It's so far.
[31:37.510 --> 31:39.890]  Yeah, that was way further than I thought you could go out there.
[31:39.910 --> 31:40.470]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[31:41.030 --> 31:41.790]  Yeah, yeah, there's like-
[31:41.790 --> 31:43.170]  That makes me think there's a secret out there.
[31:44.090 --> 31:45.210]  There is or there isn't?
[31:45.530 --> 31:47.670]  I- it makes me feel like there is for how far you can go.
[31:47.670 --> 31:47.830]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[31:47.930 --> 31:49.230]  The fact that I could go out there.
[31:49.230 --> 31:52.170]  You can look at your map, but you can't go all the way out there.
[31:52.530 --> 31:52.590]  Yeah.
[31:52.730 --> 31:53.870]  It just keeps sending you back.
[31:54.490 --> 31:54.750]  Yeah.
[31:56.150 --> 31:57.010]  Might as well.
[31:58.210 --> 31:58.650]  What's this?
[32:00.010 --> 32:01.630]  The fucking coolest part.
[32:02.170 --> 32:02.670]  It's-
[32:03.310 --> 32:03.750]  Oh.
[32:04.990 --> 32:05.770]  Not bad.
[32:06.250 --> 32:06.730]  For sure.
[32:06.850 --> 32:07.850]  This game is beachhead now.
[32:08.590 --> 32:09.110]  Oh, yeah.
[32:10.090 --> 32:11.190]  Yeah, blow these things up.
[32:11.230 --> 32:12.310]  Put the arcade thing over your head.
[32:13.030 --> 32:13.470]  Boom.
[32:14.190 --> 32:15.810]  It's like a Troika, but good.
[32:16.610 --> 32:16.830]  Yep.
[32:20.870 --> 32:21.230]  There you go.
[32:21.230 --> 32:23.710]  I also like that the game is like, take as much damage as you want.
[32:23.770 --> 32:24.130]  We don't care.
[32:24.170 --> 32:25.590]  Yeah, you give a fuck.
[32:26.690 --> 32:28.990]  I love that it's the reverse of the more you overheat it.
[32:29.110 --> 32:30.910]  That's how you charge your super attack.
[32:31.930 --> 32:33.770]  You're encouraged to just never let go.
[32:34.350 --> 32:34.550]  Yep.
[32:35.650 --> 32:36.010]  Whoa!
[32:36.570 --> 32:37.090]  Watch out for the-
[32:37.090 --> 32:38.190]  You gotta fire the bolt at him.
[32:38.530 --> 32:39.950]  Careful of the Rokai with the explosives.
[32:40.850 --> 32:41.950]  Fuck him up like this.
[32:42.650 --> 32:43.070]  Hell yeah.
[32:45.230 --> 32:45.990]  This part's cool.
[32:46.010 --> 32:46.530]  That's terrifying.
[32:47.330 --> 32:47.630]  Yep.
[32:47.930 --> 32:48.270]  Bolt him!
[32:48.310 --> 32:48.730]  Choke him!
[32:49.670 --> 32:51.330]  Fuck yeah, his arm came off.
[32:51.510 --> 32:53.090]  Where'd your arm go, asshole?
[32:53.670 --> 32:55.010]  So fucking cool.
[32:55.170 --> 32:56.430]  I hope you don't lose the other one.
[32:58.030 --> 32:58.490]  Oh, look at it.
[32:58.490 --> 32:59.610]  Look at all this bone.
[33:01.290 --> 33:02.570]  Blow him away, blow him away.
[33:03.330 --> 33:04.830]  Just fuck with that knee, huh?
[33:05.130 --> 33:05.870]  Oh, get the knee!
[33:06.010 --> 33:06.290]  Oh!
[33:06.690 --> 33:07.470]  Fuck yeah.
[33:08.410 --> 33:11.130]  He's got impressive grip of that sword for someone without any arm muscle.
[33:17.410 --> 33:18.990]  The devil lied to me.
[33:19.590 --> 33:22.990]  He promised me riches.
[33:24.330 --> 33:27.890]  I think the first game I saw Chunkage was House of the Dead.
[33:28.490 --> 33:29.050]  Oh yeah.
[33:29.570 --> 33:31.410]  That was your first Chunk game?
[33:31.890 --> 33:33.250]  I think it was my first Chunk game.
[33:33.630 --> 33:34.370]  Oh shit, Warhammer.
[33:35.110 --> 33:36.410]  Does have a Warhammer feel.
[33:36.690 --> 33:39.450]  This is very Warhammer and Dune inspired.
[33:39.710 --> 33:40.530]  Big time.
[33:41.670 --> 33:42.650]  Big time.
[33:44.870 --> 33:46.170]  Lift the beacon.
[33:46.330 --> 33:46.890]  Kingsmust've won.
[33:50.110 --> 33:51.690]  As powerful as the Slayer.
[33:52.550 --> 33:53.830]  Do you guys want to watch this or can I...
[33:55.430 --> 33:56.410]  You know what?
[33:57.290 --> 33:58.490]  Whatever you want to do, Geoff.
[33:58.630 --> 33:58.950]  You're playing.
[33:59.390 --> 34:00.150]  It's up to you.
[34:00.630 --> 34:01.350]  Chapter complete.
[34:02.690 --> 34:03.550]  Four of six secrets?
[34:03.790 --> 34:04.390]  Four of six.
[34:05.710 --> 34:06.530]  I'm gonna play this game.
[34:07.470 --> 34:08.330]  It's pretty cool.
[34:08.670 --> 34:09.370]  It is pretty cool.
[34:09.490 --> 34:10.450]  Should've played it this morning.
[34:13.210 --> 34:14.550]  Do we play again or is that it?
[34:15.430 --> 34:16.170]  What do you want?
[34:16.490 --> 34:18.030]  Yeah, do you want to play again or are you done?
[34:18.030 --> 34:18.610]  Do you want...
[34:19.250 --> 34:21.710]  I could potentially swap over and show the mech thing.
[34:21.730 --> 34:22.630]  I'll do some mech stuff.
[34:23.010 --> 34:24.330]  Oh, I can do some mech stuff if you want.
[34:24.370 --> 34:25.150]  I would love that.
[34:25.350 --> 34:27.030]  So that'd be a new one for us.
[34:27.150 --> 34:29.630]  Like different points of view in the same video.
[34:29.770 --> 34:30.090]  That'd be cool.
[34:30.170 --> 34:31.090]  I like it. Let's do that.
[34:31.270 --> 34:31.970]  Like a handoff.
[34:32.910 --> 34:34.790]  Yeah, let's keep recording audio.
[34:35.470 --> 34:37.270]  And then Andrew will switch video.
[34:37.610 --> 34:40.890]  And then Gavin can ask about how we can record a backup on that.
[34:41.550 --> 34:44.090]  So if you ever wanted to see chapter one and chapter nine
[34:45.090 --> 34:45.990]  back to back.
[34:46.750 --> 34:47.670]  What a treat.
[34:47.930 --> 34:48.290]  Here it is.
[34:48.370 --> 34:48.910]  Hell yeah, brother.
[34:50.350 --> 34:51.190]  Forsaken Plains.
[34:51.470 --> 34:52.210]  Let's go back.
[34:53.210 --> 34:53.390]  Cool.
[34:53.910 --> 34:56.230]  I think Barrier Core is the mech stuff?
[34:56.310 --> 34:56.910]  Looks like it.
[34:56.970 --> 34:57.190]  Cool.
[34:58.550 --> 34:59.090]  Whoa, sick.
[34:59.090 --> 34:59.590]  Pretty mechy.
[34:59.950 --> 35:00.700]  So this is...
[35:01.090 --> 35:04.010]  This plays into the lore of some of the other ones, I guess.
[35:04.110 --> 35:05.080]  Because that you see...
[35:06.250 --> 35:09.130]  I think you see this thing in the other games.
[35:09.170 --> 35:09.630]  Oh, shit.
[35:09.670 --> 35:13.090]  Well, also in chapter two, you're like going through a facility where you see like
[35:13.090 --> 35:14.650]  schematics for it and stuff.
[35:16.090 --> 35:16.850]  That's cool.
[35:18.770 --> 35:20.650]  I did the 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, right?
[35:22.410 --> 35:23.970]  I don't remember hearing it.
[35:24.110 --> 35:24.570]  Not that I heard.
[35:24.590 --> 35:25.530]  1, 2, 3.
[35:26.050 --> 35:27.510]  1, 2, 3.
[35:28.790 --> 35:30.870]  If you're watching this video, enjoy that part.
[35:37.560 --> 35:39.280]  I need a chair like that.
[35:39.720 --> 35:40.120]  Yeah.
[35:40.500 --> 35:41.200]  That's the chair.
[35:41.440 --> 35:42.240]  So cool.
[35:42.260 --> 35:43.320]  I like the uncovered arms.
[35:48.350 --> 35:49.930]  Yeah, plug in.
[35:50.790 --> 35:51.630]  Jack in.
[35:52.590 --> 35:53.410]  Jacked on.
[35:54.630 --> 35:57.070]  This is the new DX racer chair, right?
[35:58.630 --> 36:00.870]  I think Razor's putting this one out.
[36:01.010 --> 36:01.730]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[36:07.480 --> 36:08.120]  Here we go.
[36:08.440 --> 36:09.400]  Holy shit.
[36:10.860 --> 36:11.300]  Wow.
[36:14.620 --> 36:16.080]  See how tiny everything is?
[36:16.200 --> 36:16.640]  And you can go...
[36:17.060 --> 36:18.380]  I guess you can't break that one.
[36:20.480 --> 36:21.160]  Here we go.
[36:21.320 --> 36:21.600]  Here we go.
[36:23.060 --> 36:23.500]  Wow.
[36:24.020 --> 36:24.460]  Jeez.
[36:24.740 --> 36:26.180]  You got them tiny little guys.
[36:28.640 --> 36:29.520]  Holy shit.
[36:29.860 --> 36:30.880]  Oh my god.
[36:31.680 --> 36:32.780]  Dude, this is awesome.
[36:33.060 --> 36:33.400]  Yeah.
[36:33.840 --> 36:35.480]  Can they hurt you at all?
[36:35.900 --> 36:37.000]  No, not the little ones.
[36:38.640 --> 36:39.640]  Got a full sprint.
[36:39.720 --> 36:41.380]  You must be going like 200 miles an hour.
[36:41.820 --> 36:42.040]  Yeah.
[36:45.760 --> 36:46.200]  So...
[36:46.200 --> 36:47.400]  Is it...
[36:47.400 --> 36:48.240]  Wow, jeez.
[36:48.380 --> 36:50.580]  Is it all pretty hand-to-hand like melee stuff?
[36:50.760 --> 36:51.880]  Yes, for the most part.
[36:51.880 --> 36:53.080]  And then you eventually get a gun.
[36:53.740 --> 36:54.140]  Cool.
[36:54.880 --> 36:56.160]  I sure hope that people don't...
[36:56.160 --> 36:56.680]  Is this in Hell?
[36:56.820 --> 36:57.420]  It's run through...
[36:57.980 --> 36:59.380]  Uh, no, this...
[36:59.380 --> 37:00.080]  This...
[37:00.080 --> 37:01.760]  There's... It takes place on a bunch of different planets.
[37:01.880 --> 37:02.040]  Oh, okay.
[37:02.380 --> 37:03.580]  And what chapter is this, Andrew?
[37:04.220 --> 37:05.020]  Chapter three.
[37:05.160 --> 37:07.220]  So I think it's literally the next thing that you guys need.
[37:07.300 --> 37:07.680]  Oh my god, hell yeah.
[37:07.760 --> 37:11.740]  So then next time we play, I'll do chapter two and you do chapter four.
[37:12.140 --> 37:12.540]  Okay.
[37:13.240 --> 37:13.740]  Sounds good.
[37:15.420 --> 37:16.860]  Dude, this is awesome.
[37:21.480 --> 37:21.880]  Wow.
[37:22.700 --> 37:23.420]  This rocks.
[37:26.760 --> 37:29.580]  Is this one of those levels where it's just meant to be a fun new mechanic?
[37:29.800 --> 37:30.760]  Or is it difficult?
[37:30.940 --> 37:31.540]  Like, can you die?
[37:31.620 --> 37:33.040]  No, it's just a fun new mechanic.
[37:33.940 --> 37:34.940]  Definitely looks like it.
[37:36.720 --> 37:37.560]  This is, uh...
[37:39.720 --> 37:40.600]  Damn, hell yeah.
[37:40.740 --> 37:41.340]  That was sick.
[37:41.480 --> 37:42.780]  This is so fucking cool.
[37:43.080 --> 37:43.720]  Yeah, this is awesome.
[37:44.040 --> 37:45.620]  I always love when video games are like, you know what?
[37:45.640 --> 37:47.460]  We're just gonna give you a cool level now.
[37:47.580 --> 37:50.020]  We're not gonna beat the shit out of you or stress you out.
[37:50.020 --> 37:51.980]  We're just gonna let you fucking go balls out.
[37:52.080 --> 37:53.820]  Well, we'll beat the shit out of you later.
[37:54.020 --> 37:55.240]  Enjoy this for right now.
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.080]  Take this respite.
[37:57.860 --> 37:58.260]  Yeah.
[37:58.520 --> 37:59.780]  God damn, it's so cool.
[37:59.840 --> 38:00.960]  They just explode.
[38:02.540 --> 38:07.520]  What I really like about this game is that you don't give a shit about the humans or any...
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.860]  It is just, it's purely hatred for demons that is powering you through everything you do.
[38:11.940 --> 38:13.060]  And I think that's so cool.
[38:15.900 --> 38:18.980]  And I'll say this isn't the only one of these in the sense of
[38:18.980 --> 38:20.860]  there's another way you get to play this game.
[38:21.040 --> 38:21.860]  That is really cool.
[38:22.340 --> 38:22.820]  Cool.
[38:23.160 --> 38:24.660]  Is it like, are you in a boat?
[38:24.920 --> 38:25.600]  A speed boat?
[38:25.940 --> 38:26.880]  Like Hydro Thunder?
[38:27.700 --> 38:27.980]  Sort of.
[38:28.620 --> 38:29.120]  That's cool.
[38:30.820 --> 38:34.000]  Do we get to sail the wind like we did in Gears Judgment?
[38:34.800 --> 38:35.280]  Exactly.
[38:37.140 --> 38:38.560]  Damn, is this like your new weapon?
[38:38.780 --> 38:40.040]  It's my new gun.
[38:40.380 --> 38:41.700]  It's like a skyscraper.
[38:43.100 --> 38:44.060]  That's his new weapon.
[38:44.720 --> 38:45.220]  Oh my...
[38:45.700 --> 38:46.860]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[38:47.340 --> 38:50.640]  Well, perfect dodge to supercharge your weapon.
[38:51.160 --> 38:52.800]  Oh my god.
[38:52.960 --> 38:55.020]  Those bullets must be like the size of a train.
[38:55.480 --> 38:55.760]  Yeah.
[38:56.380 --> 38:59.560]  You're shooting trains at those guys.
[39:00.160 --> 39:01.700]  Hundreds of cars along.
[39:02.600 --> 39:04.320]  This guy's doing the locomotion.
[39:04.540 --> 39:05.180]  This is fucked.
[39:05.400 --> 39:07.280]  Can you block the greens with this character?
[39:07.640 --> 39:08.220]  This mech?
[39:08.820 --> 39:09.640]  Oh, you like counter.
[39:09.760 --> 39:10.420]  You like dodge.
[39:11.240 --> 39:11.480]  Yeah.
[39:11.580 --> 39:12.600]  It's like bobbing and weaving.
[39:13.240 --> 39:14.140]  Oh my god.
[39:14.200 --> 39:14.820]  There's just like...
[39:14.820 --> 39:16.180]  It like just doesn't overheat.
[39:16.260 --> 39:18.140]  You just keep pulling the fucking trigger.
[39:18.440 --> 39:19.960]  This is like the best.
[39:21.760 --> 39:23.200]  I'm so excited to play this.
[39:23.440 --> 39:24.760]  I'm so excited to play this level.
[39:25.840 --> 39:28.320]  You just tried to shoot all the meat off that one guy.
[39:31.060 --> 39:31.540]  Sprint.
[39:31.940 --> 39:33.400]  This sprint is so cool.
[39:33.840 --> 39:35.420]  Just blasting.
[39:35.580 --> 39:36.780]  Like, who gives a shit?
[39:38.040 --> 39:41.760]  Dude, I thought I could make a recommendation for you in-game.
[39:42.060 --> 39:42.280]  Andrew?
[39:42.940 --> 39:44.920]  Don't ever take this suit off.
[39:45.060 --> 39:46.100]  Just play the rest of the game.
[39:46.280 --> 39:46.700]  Oh, yeah.
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.580]  That's the way to do it.
[39:50.420 --> 39:52.500]  Like a whole map takes you four steps.
[39:57.340 --> 40:02.020]  It's just so cool that they made a video game where hell fears you.
[40:03.300 --> 40:04.300]  That's sick.
[40:05.520 --> 40:06.960]  That's so cool.
[40:07.140 --> 40:11.340]  Do you think the guy, the original Doom creator was just like super Christian?
[40:11.340 --> 40:12.340]  It was like, finally.
[40:15.820 --> 40:17.440]  Doing this for God.
[40:17.820 --> 40:18.700]  This is Bible 2099.
[40:21.180 --> 40:22.980]  All my friends are doing Warhammer.
[40:23.100 --> 40:23.820]  I'm doing this.
[40:28.380 --> 40:31.320]  Oh, dude, there's like nothing left.
[40:31.900 --> 40:33.400]  Just punched his bicep off.
[40:33.960 --> 40:34.860]  That's so cool.
[40:35.420 --> 40:36.900]  Oh, damn.
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.660]  This is what the Celtics did to the Knicks last night.
[40:43.700 --> 40:46.260]  That was Josh Hart on the ground bleeding back there.
[40:53.580 --> 40:54.380]  This is...
[40:54.380 --> 40:59.000]  It took a long time for them to get to this point in Doom and boy, am I glad they got here.
[40:59.040 --> 41:00.680]  This is fucking rad.
[41:00.820 --> 41:05.280]  I gotta say, having played the first level now twice, it's been a flawless experience too.
[41:05.380 --> 41:06.820]  Like the game runs great.
[41:06.920 --> 41:07.660]  It feels great.
[41:07.660 --> 41:09.220]  I've had no glitches.
[41:09.220 --> 41:13.580]  I've had no confusion on what to do or where to go.
[41:13.880 --> 41:16.160]  It's a really solid experience.
[41:16.620 --> 41:18.140]  It's so cool.
[41:19.160 --> 41:20.300]  Ever since they screwed up...
[41:20.300 --> 41:20.780]  Do you know how many...
[41:20.780 --> 41:21.380]  Oh, go ahead, Geoff.
[41:21.680 --> 41:22.180]  Go ahead, Nick.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.920]  I was gonna say, ever since they screwed up Doom 3, it's nice to see that they got another chance
[41:27.920 --> 41:28.680]  at actually making it.
[41:28.800 --> 41:30.040]  The evolution, yeah.
[41:30.580 --> 41:33.940]  Dude, I'm telling you, like, you gotta go back and play those other Doom games.
[41:33.940 --> 41:35.300]  All three are so...
[41:35.300 --> 41:36.520]  God, they're so good.
[41:36.520 --> 41:38.700]  What is it, Doom Eternal, and...
[41:38.700 --> 41:41.920]  Yeah, Doom, Doom Eternal, and then this one, Doom Dark Age.
[41:42.140 --> 41:43.720]  So what's so dogshit about Doom 3?
[41:44.440 --> 41:45.240]  You can't...
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.600]  It's so dark, and it's like trying to be, like, atmospheric, and it's...
[41:49.600 --> 41:50.880]  Yeah, you have a flashlight.
[41:51.100 --> 41:53.780]  Here's a jump scare, and it's, like, for Doom?
[41:56.240 --> 41:57.360]  This is so cool.
[41:57.600 --> 41:58.920]  Doom guy will not be jump scared.
[41:59.560 --> 42:03.320]  I replayed all the Doom games, like, a few years ago, because I wanted to...
[42:03.320 --> 42:03.660]  Yeah.
[42:03.660 --> 42:07.100]  I wanted to play Doom 64, and I'm like, I'll play Doom 1 and 2, and, like, all that stuff.
[42:07.200 --> 42:10.080]  And then, dude, you play Doom 3, and you're just like, dude, this is bad.
[42:10.220 --> 42:10.940]  Like, it's bad.
[42:10.980 --> 42:11.660]  It's, like, legitimately a bad game.
[42:11.660 --> 42:12.440]  It's rough, yeah.
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.140]  I did the same thing last year and had the exact same experience.
[42:16.540 --> 42:20.440]  But you play stuff like Doom 2 and Doom 64 and stuff, and it's like, man, these are,
[42:20.440 --> 42:22.620]  like, really fun games.
[42:25.180 --> 42:25.600]  Uh-oh.
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.080]  Man, they really tried to put a lot of weird games out on 64, though.
[42:29.940 --> 42:30.260]  Yeah.
[42:30.380 --> 42:30.900]  Remember Starcraft?
[42:32.100 --> 42:32.420]  Yeah.
[42:36.370 --> 42:37.550]  Remember Starcraft Ghosts?
[42:38.290 --> 42:39.070]  I'd like to.
[42:40.330 --> 42:41.650]  I wish I did.
[42:42.070 --> 42:43.250]  The book turned out well.
[42:45.310 --> 42:46.970]  Gotta get this bomb out of the city.
[42:47.330 --> 42:48.990]  I remember seeing it at E3 every year.
[42:49.670 --> 42:49.910]  Yep.
[42:50.150 --> 42:50.350]  Oh.
[42:50.910 --> 42:52.030]  Dude, this is...
[42:52.870 --> 42:54.130]  You dig this.
[42:55.670 --> 42:57.070]  You gotta stuff it down it.
[42:57.310 --> 42:57.550]  Oh!
[42:58.210 --> 43:00.270]  Take it back to hell.
[43:02.450 --> 43:03.350]  Bye-bye.
[43:05.510 --> 43:07.510]  Looks like the tube on Geonosis.
[43:11.610 --> 43:15.430]  Well, yeah, why were you flying over it?
[43:16.110 --> 43:17.270]  Oh, no, did you have to leave your thing?
[43:17.750 --> 43:17.770]  No!
[43:18.690 --> 43:19.410]  Oh, damn.
[43:21.550 --> 43:22.550]  My loyal suit.
[43:23.350 --> 43:24.250]  Your big body's gone.
[43:26.670 --> 43:28.110]  Now you're just a normal giant, man.
[43:33.240 --> 43:36.240]  Do you think we'll get to a point in our future where we don't touch our ears
[43:36.240 --> 43:37.440]  when we listen to transponders?
[43:37.440 --> 43:39.740]  Dude, that's such a great question, Geoff.
[43:39.860 --> 43:41.600]  I never... that never would have crossed my mind.
[43:41.700 --> 43:42.320]  You're a genius.
[43:43.120 --> 43:44.280]  You get real sick of it.
[43:44.320 --> 43:44.520]  That never occurred to me.
[43:44.920 --> 43:45.160]  Yep.
[43:46.220 --> 43:47.160]  I'm writing that down.
[43:47.400 --> 43:49.820]  I'm gonna have a genius ID in 2246.
[43:55.210 --> 43:56.770]  Where's those books you hate so much, Eric?
[43:56.910 --> 43:57.670]  I did as you asked.
[43:58.350 --> 43:59.790]  Can't read a fucking word, dude.
[44:00.510 --> 44:01.190]  Nice hat.
[44:01.510 --> 44:02.390]  Let your soul be at peace.
[44:02.870 --> 44:03.910]  I'm gonna make Nick wear that.
[44:04.090 --> 44:04.590]  Please don't.
[44:04.930 --> 44:05.870]  Put him with the boots.
[44:07.410 --> 44:08.070]  Uh-oh.
[44:09.970 --> 44:10.850]  Oh, shit.
[44:13.590 --> 44:17.270]  I feel like if he twatted his head on a doorframe, that would go straight in his ear.
[44:17.870 --> 44:18.930]  Oh, man.
[44:20.950 --> 44:22.570]  Gotta be careful walking around with that.
[44:28.090 --> 44:28.530]  Yay.
[44:29.890 --> 44:31.110]  Cannot wait to play that.
[44:31.370 --> 44:32.750]  Cannot wait to play that.
[44:32.990 --> 44:33.910]  That is incredible.
[44:34.250 --> 44:34.490]  Wow.
[44:34.950 --> 44:35.170]  Dude.
[44:36.230 --> 44:37.210]  Nick, you gotta play Doom.
[44:37.290 --> 44:37.630]  Dude, yeah.
[44:37.890 --> 44:38.310]  You gotta play Doom.
[44:38.630 --> 44:39.110]  So do you, Gavin.
[44:39.450 --> 44:40.690]  Nick, why don't...
[44:40.690 --> 44:46.390]  Next time, Nick, why don't you play Chapter 6 and then, Gavin, you immediately follow up with Chapter 8?
[44:47.510 --> 44:48.230]  What's the last level?
[44:49.290 --> 44:49.730]  22.
[44:50.070 --> 44:50.930]  I'll play 22.
[44:51.590 --> 44:52.030]  Okay.
[44:53.830 --> 44:54.790]  It's pretty cool.
[44:55.010 --> 44:55.830]  Nick, you pick your level.
[44:56.390 --> 44:57.950]  Okay, I'll let you know when I get there.
[44:58.530 --> 44:58.810]  All right.
