[00:00.000 --> 00:03.380]  Hello and welcome to Irregulation! Trucks are back.
[00:03.540 --> 00:06.600]  Yeah! We're in Austria. Gavin, come out here with your truck.
[00:06.740 --> 00:10.540]  Where are my truck? Where are your- where- where are your truck?
[00:11.220 --> 00:14.320]  Should I just buy something cheap and drive that? Yeah.
[00:15.040 --> 00:18.960]  This is Geoff sinking again. One, two, three, four, five, six...
[00:18.960 --> 00:22.240]  Sorry, I was making sure I was recording. I'm not- I'm a little nervous. My machine's
[00:22.240 --> 00:24.760]  acting- been acting a little weird. What's wrong? We're just making double sure.
[00:25.040 --> 00:27.920]  No, I think it stopped recording and I just want to make sure
[00:27.920 --> 00:31.100]  so I restarted everything. Good thinking. We're fine.
[00:31.720 --> 00:36.180]  Ah, shit, I bought two of them. Shit! Oh, can you just sell it back? Sell it back, guys.
[00:36.420 --> 00:40.040]  This is bad. I'm gonna beat the shit out of my wheel until Gavin gets it.
[00:40.260 --> 00:46.420]  Get out of here! Get out here! Oh, there he is. There we go. I thought I didn't take.
[00:47.180 --> 00:50.260]  Oh, oh wait, Gavin, I got an idea. I got an idea. Yeah. One sec.
[00:51.260 --> 00:54.920]  You- you hang out here just for one second. Uh, okay.
[00:54.920 --> 00:58.540]  Uh, nice horn you got there. I got you, buddy. Thank you.
[00:58.940 --> 01:03.700]  I was talking about Gavin, but- Oh. What did you say was nice?
[01:04.020 --> 01:06.000]  Your horn. Did I beep?
[01:06.800 --> 01:07.520]  Oh. I've been beeping.
[01:07.980 --> 01:10.860]  Oh, never mind. Geoff has a great horn then. Thank you!
[01:11.020 --> 01:12.700]  So you were talking about- Gavin, get over here. Get over here.
[01:12.900 --> 01:14.660]  Nick's a mess. What?
[01:14.900 --> 01:17.320]  What is going on with Nick these days? I don't know.
[01:17.340 --> 01:18.900]  Gavin, recover. Hit recover.
[01:19.340 --> 01:22.060]  Hit recover. Drive on up, buddy.
[01:22.060 --> 01:26.740]  Oh, hell yeah. Oh, cool. This is some teamwork. This looks great.
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.280]  All right, do we boys want to go- What are we doing here, Andrew? We're salt- We're going to-
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.760]  I don't- I guess we're going- You want us to go to Austria? We're checking out Austria.
[01:36.040 --> 01:38.980]  Pull me up. I think we were gonna try to do the- What was the mission?
[01:39.980 --> 01:40.980]  Let's see. A fire safety.
[01:41.200 --> 01:44.260]  Oh, oh, Gavin! Drive forward! Drive forward!
[01:44.360 --> 01:47.560]  Andrew, you gotta pull him up. You gotta move your- You gotta move your tow-
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.960]  Taking stock of the damage. We're taking stock of the damage.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.980]  Everybody follow me. You need to drive forward!
[01:54.900 --> 01:57.740]  Oh my god. Okay, go back down, go back down. I'll just floor it the whole time.
[02:01.520 --> 02:05.160]  Oh, shit! Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna put my brake on.
[02:05.360 --> 02:07.640]  Wait, oh, holy shit! Yeah, now he's up.
[02:07.660 --> 02:08.920]  Now pull me up. Now pull him up.
[02:09.740 --> 02:12.180]  I'm pulling you up. One sec. This is-
[02:12.180 --> 02:14.200]  Yeah, you're not. I'm watching you not pull him up.
[02:14.680 --> 02:17.000]  Yeah, one sec. Okay, that's the wrong way.
[02:17.420 --> 02:19.200]  I'm wasting gas. Yeah, no kidding.
[02:19.200 --> 02:19.940]  There we go.
[02:22.420 --> 02:25.860]  Keep going, keep going, keep going. You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it.
[02:26.900 --> 02:28.920]  Okay, you got Gavin. Alright, Gavin, you're good.
[02:29.540 --> 02:31.600]  Handbrake on. Alright, so now-
[02:31.600 --> 02:33.100]  Yeah. Should I tether somehow?
[02:33.540 --> 02:35.060]  Do we need to go back to the- Yeah, tether to him.
[02:35.080 --> 02:38.200]  What do you think, or? Uh, they're alright.
[02:38.400 --> 02:40.180]  Woah, woah, woah. They're alright.
[02:40.220 --> 02:40.820]  Can you tether to him?
[02:43.720 --> 02:45.840]  How do you do that again? There you go.
[02:45.860 --> 02:47.540]  Why? And then winch-
[02:47.540 --> 02:50.900]  Winch connected to the front. Yeah, there you go.
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.080]  Alright, he's got you now.
[02:54.200 --> 02:55.680]  There you go. There you go.
[02:55.820 --> 02:56.540]  Alright. There we go.
[02:56.660 --> 02:57.220]  Head on out, baby.
[02:57.540 --> 02:57.980]  Woah! Oh no!
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.600]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[03:01.140 --> 03:02.360]  Are you guys having some oopsies?
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.620]  Yeah. We're having some oopsies.
[03:05.720 --> 03:07.240]  Yeah, there's some oopsies.
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.440]  How are you doing back there, Nick?
[03:10.860 --> 03:12.100]  Uh, I'll tell you in a minute.
[03:13.740 --> 03:14.840]  I can tell you right- I'm gonna take a run-up this time.
[03:14.860 --> 03:16.360]  I can tell you right now if you want.
[03:17.320 --> 03:17.880]  Do great.
[03:20.340 --> 03:20.900]  Alright, you ready, Andrew?
[03:21.600 --> 03:22.420]  Oh, I'm so ready.
[03:23.060 --> 03:24.080]  I killed that tree.
[03:24.860 --> 03:26.220]  Oh, you're gonna- you're gonna ramp?
[03:26.340 --> 03:27.720]  Here, let me- let me get it higher for you.
[03:27.740 --> 03:30.300]  I'm watching this from the menu and it looks fascinating.
[03:30.500 --> 03:31.140]  It's pretty good.
[03:31.780 --> 03:32.120]  Oh yeah?
[03:32.460 --> 03:32.880]  Watch this.
[03:32.980 --> 03:33.600]  It's fucking ramping.
[03:33.600 --> 03:34.960]  Wait, put it back on the ground. Put it back on the ground.
[03:36.420 --> 03:36.680]  No!
[03:36.960 --> 03:38.480]  It's on the ground! It's on the ground! It's on the ground!
[03:38.560 --> 03:39.460]  It's on the ground! Go, go, go!
[03:42.340 --> 03:42.620]  Shit.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.160]  Shit.
[03:45.120 --> 03:46.420]  I'm just killing the wildlife.
[03:46.680 --> 03:47.180]  I gotcha.
[03:49.520 --> 03:50.680]  Gavin seems to be on this side.
[03:51.240 --> 03:51.800]  Yeah, I got him.
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.540]  You know, it's been- it happens.
[03:55.180 --> 03:55.760]  It happens.
[03:56.680 --> 03:57.360]  Let's go!
[03:58.620 --> 03:58.980]  Okay.
[04:03.220 --> 04:05.280]  Oh, okay, there's another route I'm gonna take.
[04:05.980 --> 04:08.660]  Yeah, you guys can take that other little- that right looked a little dicey to me,
[04:08.740 --> 04:10.540]  so I didn't take it, but I'm gonna go the long way around.
[04:10.540 --> 04:13.860]  Let me tell you how dicey the route we did take was.
[04:14.800 --> 04:16.480]  Oh, this also looks dicey.
[04:17.220 --> 04:20.040]  So are we following- am I going Nick's way?
[04:20.520 --> 04:21.340]  Yeah, go Nick's way.
[04:21.400 --> 04:22.420]  Yeah, go Nick's way.
[04:22.540 --> 04:23.360]  Yeah, let's see how it goes.
[04:23.800 --> 04:24.180]  Okay, son.
[04:27.080 --> 04:27.960]  All right.
[04:31.220 --> 04:32.720]  Where does the road go?
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.580]  Just go straight across?
[04:34.700 --> 04:34.940]  All right.
[04:37.520 --> 04:38.540]  Oh, you go down there?
[04:39.200 --> 04:39.560]  Uh, yeah.
[04:42.040 --> 04:43.140]  Oh, dangerous water level.
[04:43.800 --> 04:45.120]  It's not telling me that yet.
[04:46.220 --> 04:47.620]  Oh, this is where I am.
[04:48.360 --> 04:50.140]  Oh my god!
[04:50.920 --> 04:52.440]  Sorry, coming through.
[04:55.460 --> 04:57.140]  How's it going, fellas?
[04:59.180 --> 05:00.420]  Nick's going the interesting way.
[05:00.560 --> 05:01.340]  We're back!
[05:02.300 --> 05:02.880]  Hey, guys.
[05:03.720 --> 05:05.420]  I don't think Austria likes us very much.
[05:06.220 --> 05:06.640]  Us.
[05:06.840 --> 05:07.240]  Yeah, us.
[05:07.240 --> 05:08.280]  Everything is so far away.
[05:09.900 --> 05:10.960]  Fuck it, I'm gonna go right.
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.560]  I'm going- I'm doing what Nick's doing.
[05:12.900 --> 05:13.780]  Oh, yeah, this is good.
[05:13.920 --> 05:14.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:14.600 --> 05:15.440]  Definitely do that.
[05:15.660 --> 05:17.340]  Oh, that's a much better route.
[05:19.780 --> 05:21.180]  Oh, there's a rock.
[05:21.360 --> 05:22.320]  That's why.
[05:22.620 --> 05:22.980]  Okay.
[05:24.140 --> 05:25.340]  Oh, there's all kinds of rocks.
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.480]  Andrew found all the rocks.
[05:27.100 --> 05:29.780]  What- hey, Geoff, what happens when it says engine three
[05:29.780 --> 05:31.500]  and it keeps popping up on the screen?
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.280]  Those are bonus points.
[05:32.720 --> 05:33.540]  Is that bonus points?
[05:33.820 --> 05:36.920]  I think it just means he's taking three points of damage over and over again.
[05:36.980 --> 05:38.140]  He's probably in the water.
[05:39.360 --> 05:40.480]  Upside down or something.
[05:40.720 --> 05:41.200]  Flooded, maybe.
[05:41.360 --> 05:41.680]  I don't know.
[05:41.860 --> 05:42.480]  Okay, I see.
[05:42.780 --> 05:43.620]  Slamming into something.
[05:43.900 --> 05:45.320]  I like what you're thinking there, Gavin.
[05:46.900 --> 05:47.420]  A little bit of that.
[05:48.060 --> 05:49.220]  Andrew, you're way ahead, right?
[05:49.660 --> 05:51.300]  I mean, I'm sideways.
[05:51.540 --> 05:52.620]  I don't know if I'd say I'm ahead.
[05:52.720 --> 05:53.380]  Oh, I see you.
[05:53.720 --> 05:54.100]  Good movie.
[05:54.500 --> 05:55.280]  I'm in a puddle.
[05:56.280 --> 05:58.340]  That's a little bit more than a puddle, I'd say.
[05:58.600 --> 06:01.500]  Ah, it's, you know, relative to the truck size.
[06:01.620 --> 06:02.180]  It's a little puddle.
[06:03.280 --> 06:03.680]  Ah!
[06:03.940 --> 06:04.880]  I'm on my way out.
[06:05.100 --> 06:05.840]  I'm making it through.
[06:06.620 --> 06:07.760]  Making his way downtown.
[06:09.420 --> 06:11.860]  I really hope this isn't how you get downtown.
[06:12.300 --> 06:14.640]  That city has some bad infrastructure.
[06:15.300 --> 06:18.340]  I feel like I forgot what this game felt like.
[06:18.440 --> 06:18.600]  Yeah.
[06:18.960 --> 06:20.180]  Do you remember now?
[06:22.320 --> 06:24.040]  Uh, I'm gonna go.
[06:24.140 --> 06:25.220]  Oh boy, I'm taking a...
[06:27.080 --> 06:28.580]  Taking a risk here.
[06:29.020 --> 06:30.560]  All right, knocked over a scarecrow.
[06:31.140 --> 06:31.900]  Hell yeah.
[06:32.540 --> 06:36.480]  Ah, silly bastard mud.
[06:36.640 --> 06:37.440]  Couldn't keep me forever.
[06:37.440 --> 06:39.340]  What the fuck is that?
[06:39.600 --> 06:40.440]  Eric, you've seen this?
[06:40.980 --> 06:41.820]  What is that?
[06:42.120 --> 06:42.480]  Truck.
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.640]  Mud is a silly bastard.
[06:44.960 --> 06:45.860]  Is it not a truck?
[06:46.860 --> 06:49.120]  If it might be something, it might be a truck you can go unlock.
[06:49.280 --> 06:49.720]  Go get it.
[06:51.500 --> 06:52.240]  It's like a...
[06:53.220 --> 06:54.620]  It's a farm equipment.
[06:54.940 --> 06:56.960]  Yeah, it's like farm equipment on a trailer, I think.
[06:59.040 --> 07:01.400]  Oh, it's like a hose or I don't, yeah, I don't know.
[07:02.120 --> 07:04.560]  Yeah, it looks like maybe it's farm equipment, but it is.
[07:04.640 --> 07:05.220]  It's a trailer.
[07:05.440 --> 07:06.400]  I think you're supposed to take it.
[07:06.460 --> 07:07.420]  It's bigger than you.
[07:07.420 --> 07:09.000]  So I don't know if you can't.
[07:11.140 --> 07:12.860]  This is fucking mud.
[07:13.420 --> 07:15.160]  All right, here we go.
[07:15.260 --> 07:16.340]  I'm moving now, baby.
[07:17.100 --> 07:17.980]  Way to go, man.
[07:18.260 --> 07:20.400]  Hey, listen, my time in the mud.
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.780]  Here, I'm gonna go ahead and do...
[07:22.280 --> 07:25.900]  Knock out this checkpoint thing or whatever so that we have a little bit of progress.
[07:26.040 --> 07:29.420]  And then I'll go back to wherever y'all are and help you do whatever it is.
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.660]  I opened my mini-map and Gavin's just in the woods going deeper.
[07:34.360 --> 07:35.560]  Well, I'm trying not to get in the mud.
[07:36.040 --> 07:37.320]  You guys should all...
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.120]  Don't forget you have winches and, you know, you should be able to pull yourselves through stuff.
[07:41.220 --> 07:44.440]  Well, here's the thing about the wildlife in the area.
[07:44.660 --> 07:46.460]  The trees don't last long for the winches.
[07:47.500 --> 07:49.540]  I stole a tree and I can't get rid of it.
[07:51.620 --> 07:53.240]  What's the release tree button?
[07:54.160 --> 07:55.240]  I think that's also why.
[07:57.100 --> 08:00.360]  As long as everybody's having a good time, that's all I care about.
[08:00.360 --> 08:01.700]  Uh, debatable.
[08:01.800 --> 08:05.160]  We have to check on this land to help these people out.
[08:06.120 --> 08:08.040]  They're hard times in Austria right now.
[08:08.480 --> 08:10.480]  Jesus Christ, this is rough.
[08:12.820 --> 08:13.040]  Yeah.
[08:13.940 --> 08:15.200]  Can you say that again?
[08:15.860 --> 08:17.240]  Trying not to winch.
[08:19.840 --> 08:20.400]  Why?
[08:20.960 --> 08:22.700]  Just see if I can drive it.
[08:23.140 --> 08:23.700]  Okay.
[08:24.460 --> 08:25.800]  Give myself challenges.
[08:27.720 --> 08:28.280]  I...
[08:28.280 --> 08:31.180]  This is so hard because I choose it to be.
[08:32.040 --> 08:33.240]  That's life, isn't it though?
[08:33.680 --> 08:33.960]  Yeah.
[08:34.500 --> 08:35.460]  Doesn't have to be.
[08:35.580 --> 08:37.360]  We gotta give ourselves something to overcome.
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.220]  Otherwise, what's the point?
[08:38.780 --> 08:40.200]  You wait, so you could just choose...
[08:41.820 --> 08:43.040]  Wait, what? What was my point?
[08:43.240 --> 08:44.860]  God damn these trees!
[08:45.180 --> 08:50.180]  Your point was that without adding difficulty to life, there is no difficulty in life.
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.300]  That's not necessarily...
[08:51.300 --> 08:51.860]  What are you... what?
[08:53.800 --> 08:55.000]  That's what I'm saying, Nick.
[08:55.880 --> 08:56.640]  Oh, wrong button.
[08:57.020 --> 08:58.700]  Uh, criminy.
[08:59.020 --> 09:00.100]  Oh, I don't want to go that way.
[09:00.220 --> 09:00.960]  Okay, I'll go up a ramp.
[09:01.100 --> 09:01.420]  Criminy?
[09:02.060 --> 09:02.380]  Yeah.
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.360]  That's how serious this is.
[09:04.880 --> 09:07.100]  I had to pull out old timey swear words.
[09:07.700 --> 09:09.260]  Did you ever invent a swear word as a kid?
[09:10.720 --> 09:12.480]  Yeah, but I can't say it on camera.
[09:13.080 --> 09:14.300]  Whoa, it's too dirty.
[09:15.240 --> 09:16.000]  It took off.
[09:16.420 --> 09:17.080]  It's too dirty.
[09:17.280 --> 09:18.860]  According to Geoff's mom, it was too dirty.
[09:19.940 --> 09:21.780]  Should I go to where you are, Geoff, or where Andrew is?
[09:22.980 --> 09:25.400]  Don't go to where I'm at because I don't know where I'm going.
[09:26.280 --> 09:27.180]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[09:27.300 --> 09:29.380]  I'm going to run over here and I'm going to pop out.
[09:29.600 --> 09:31.520]  I'm going to get this little checkpoint or whatever the mission is.
[09:31.620 --> 09:34.660]  And then I'm going to pull out some jeeps or something for y'all to fuck around with.
[09:34.980 --> 09:35.040]  Please?
[09:35.060 --> 09:36.980]  And then maybe we can unlock watchtowers.
[09:37.240 --> 09:37.860]  That'd be fun.
[09:38.620 --> 09:40.640]  Just drive around, everybody pick a watchtower to unlock.
[09:41.240 --> 09:41.860]  I'd love to.
[09:42.460 --> 09:43.680]  That'd be some progress.
[09:45.460 --> 09:49.040]  Let me... I'm so close to doing what I was doing.
[09:51.180 --> 09:52.880]  What we're all supposed to be doing.
[09:53.620 --> 09:54.800]  Am I on a road?
[09:55.020 --> 09:55.540]  Kind of.
[09:56.640 --> 09:57.520]  Ah, Christ.
[09:57.800 --> 09:59.200]  It goes the wrong way though, doesn't it?
[09:59.340 --> 10:00.160]  Ah, Christ.
[10:00.500 --> 10:02.640]  Oh, I threaded that needle so good.
[10:02.760 --> 10:03.960]  A lot of Christs here.
[10:04.540 --> 10:06.680]  I'm such a dunce.
[10:10.320 --> 10:12.200]  Nick is just in the mud.
[10:12.440 --> 10:13.900]  He's just been in the mud.
[10:15.580 --> 10:17.480]  Nick's still in the mud in the starting area.
[10:17.560 --> 10:18.420]  I'm so sorry, Nick.
[10:18.800 --> 10:19.540]  All right, here we go.
[10:19.720 --> 10:21.140]  I don't... I can't live with Nick being there.
[10:21.140 --> 10:23.300]  Yeah, Nick can't live with Nick being in here.
[10:24.060 --> 10:25.440]  Oh, no, no!
[10:25.820 --> 10:26.440]  Change truck.
[10:28.140 --> 10:29.240]  God damn it.
[10:30.020 --> 10:30.460]  Handbrake.
[10:31.600 --> 10:32.040]  No!
[10:35.540 --> 10:36.420]  All right.
[10:36.620 --> 10:38.280]  What's my idiot are stuck on?
[10:39.080 --> 10:39.860]  There's nothing there.
[10:40.000 --> 10:40.800]  What am I stuck on?
[10:41.540 --> 10:41.860]  Nick?
[10:42.100 --> 10:42.360]  Steep.
[10:42.480 --> 10:43.200]  Yeah, that's me.
[10:44.380 --> 10:46.180]  I'm gonna pull out a little...
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.620]  It's a little top heavy, but I'm pulling out like a little jeep for you.
[10:50.700 --> 10:51.120]  It's good.
[10:51.140 --> 10:52.140]  It's good stuff.
[10:52.480 --> 10:52.840]  Sweet.
[10:52.920 --> 10:53.140]  I'm gonna...
[10:53.140 --> 10:53.640]  He needs it.
[10:53.880 --> 10:55.760]  It's gonna be there for you in just a second.
[10:55.920 --> 10:56.620]  I'm driving back.
[10:59.460 --> 11:00.180]  And then...
[11:00.720 --> 11:01.080]  Ah!
[11:01.220 --> 11:01.560]  Handbrake.
[11:02.520 --> 11:05.620]  For whoever else wants it, I'm pulling out the...
[11:10.300 --> 11:10.660]  Fuck!
[11:11.700 --> 11:12.800]  I need to see where you are, Jack.
[11:14.200 --> 11:14.920]  International HX520.
[11:14.980 --> 11:15.700]  I'm not there anymore.
[11:16.120 --> 11:16.460]  I'm in the garage right now.
[11:16.460 --> 11:17.080]  Oh, the international.
[11:18.580 --> 11:19.660]  This is pretty good.
[11:21.140 --> 11:22.680]  You can fuck some stuff here.
[11:22.860 --> 11:24.080]  And then I'll pull out one more.
[11:24.080 --> 11:25.840]  Did you get that watchtower, Geoff?
[11:26.140 --> 11:26.540]  No.
[11:26.780 --> 11:27.260]  Should you?
[11:27.400 --> 11:27.700]  Yes.
[11:27.860 --> 11:28.820]  I haven't gotten any yet.
[11:29.540 --> 11:32.880]  Should I drive a San Francisco into one of those vehicles over there?
[11:34.780 --> 11:35.700]  I mean, why wouldn't you?
[11:36.520 --> 11:38.820]  I'm not sure I understand what we're saying.
[11:39.780 --> 11:41.020]  Me either, but I'm pretty excited.
[11:41.460 --> 11:42.280]  Just agree with it.
[11:42.480 --> 11:42.940]  Just say yeah.
[11:43.120 --> 11:43.860]  Oh, you didn't play that game?
[11:44.800 --> 11:45.200]  Yeah.
[11:45.540 --> 11:45.900]  All right.
[11:45.960 --> 11:47.820]  And then there's the Hummer.
[11:47.980 --> 11:49.400]  If somebody wants a H2.
[11:49.820 --> 11:50.380]  I'd love a Hummer.
[11:50.380 --> 11:52.840]  These should all be fun to drive around in.
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.120]  And then I'm gonna go back to my other car.
[11:55.860 --> 11:59.400]  That game was interesting because it had a whole section in a second person.
[12:00.080 --> 12:00.600]  What?
[12:00.780 --> 12:01.160]  Really?
[12:01.440 --> 12:01.580]  Yeah.
[12:01.720 --> 12:02.960]  What is second person?
[12:03.060 --> 12:04.440]  You're watching somebody do something?
[12:05.780 --> 12:11.560]  Uh, you're controlling you from someone else.
[12:11.980 --> 12:12.320]  What?
[12:12.440 --> 12:12.960]  What the?
[12:13.120 --> 12:13.780]  That's crazy.
[12:14.320 --> 12:15.160]  What game are you talking about?
[12:15.300 --> 12:15.620]  Wow.
[12:16.160 --> 12:16.900]  Drive a San Francisco.
[12:18.120 --> 12:18.320]  Huh.
[12:20.440 --> 12:21.300]  That's nuts.
[12:21.680 --> 12:22.780]  I remember when it came out.
[12:22.860 --> 12:23.820]  I don't remember the game.
[12:25.440 --> 12:26.780]  I remember a lot of marketing.
[12:32.490 --> 12:34.870]  Oh, fuck you, Scarecrows.
[12:36.330 --> 12:37.290]  All right.
[12:37.310 --> 12:40.230]  So anybody that wants a vehicle, I left three out there for everybody.
[12:41.990 --> 12:43.270]  Nick's almost there, dude.
[12:44.030 --> 12:46.430]  You can just go to them.
[12:46.790 --> 12:48.270]  Just click on the map.
[12:48.410 --> 12:50.670]  Just select one of them and just travel to it.
[12:50.710 --> 12:53.290]  Or click up on the d-pad and go to change truck.
[12:53.670 --> 12:53.990]  Sweet.
[12:54.090 --> 12:56.270]  You don't have to drive back.
[12:58.910 --> 12:59.890]  Which one are you going to take?
[13:02.110 --> 13:03.670]  Uh, which one do you recommend, Geoff?
[13:04.590 --> 13:06.430]  I mean, they all should be good.
[13:07.870 --> 13:08.170]  Okay.
[13:08.390 --> 13:11.410]  Like I said, the Marshall's a little top heavy, but it goes over anything.
[13:12.150 --> 13:12.890]  Look at this.
[13:13.670 --> 13:15.510]  I don't know how good the H2 is.
[13:15.570 --> 13:17.330]  I was just looking at the stats on it.
[13:17.550 --> 13:21.730]  And then the, uh, that international is like a workhorse.
[13:22.050 --> 13:22.430]  Oh, shit.
[13:22.450 --> 13:23.210]  It is top heavy.
[13:24.730 --> 13:25.410]  Okay, hold on.
[13:25.490 --> 13:25.630]  All right.
[13:25.650 --> 13:26.910]  So where, where, where, where are we going?
[13:28.410 --> 13:29.710]  Why don't we unlock watchtowers?
[13:30.590 --> 13:30.950]  Okay.
[13:30.990 --> 13:31.710]  Do we want to pick one?
[13:32.050 --> 13:34.070]  I think I'm doing, I'm just going up the map.
[13:34.350 --> 13:34.490]  Yeah.
[13:34.490 --> 13:37.650]  You guys, I'm, I'm going to finish this at destination.
[13:37.890 --> 13:38.150]  Okay.
[13:38.850 --> 13:41.510]  Whatever the fucking contract is real fast.
[13:42.230 --> 13:43.570]  I'm going to get this one fairly close.
[13:44.370 --> 13:45.170]  How do I draw the line?
[13:45.190 --> 13:48.550]  I'm near the gateway to, uh, right, uh, hit right, right trigger.
[13:50.230 --> 13:51.350]  Oh, Nick, way up.
[13:51.350 --> 13:54.990]  Oh, I'm holding, I'm holding balls.
[13:55.530 --> 13:56.410]  I slowed down.
[13:56.550 --> 13:58.730]  Oh, there's playing cards on my car.
[13:59.830 --> 14:00.830]  Oh, that's cool.
[14:01.270 --> 14:01.710]  Isn't that cool?
[14:01.970 --> 14:02.190]  Look at that.
[14:02.590 --> 14:03.110]  You ready?
[14:03.790 --> 14:04.110]  Yeah.
[14:04.510 --> 14:05.130]  Oh, shit.
[14:05.650 --> 14:06.170]  Oh, I've turned blue.
[14:06.330 --> 14:07.350]  Oh, God.
[14:07.590 --> 14:07.790]  Oh, God.
[14:07.790 --> 14:08.070]  Oh, God.
[14:08.230 --> 14:09.310]  What are you doing?
[14:09.690 --> 14:11.330]  You, you were all over the place, Nick.
[14:11.330 --> 14:12.890]  Why were you just going left and right?
[14:13.070 --> 14:13.890]  It's so top heavy.
[14:15.770 --> 14:16.970]  Well, it's so good.
[14:17.830 --> 14:19.690]  This field of view is so big.
[14:22.090 --> 14:22.450]  What?
[14:22.890 --> 14:23.810]  130 is pretty wild, isn't it?
[14:24.210 --> 14:25.250]  Yeah, it's so big.
[14:25.390 --> 14:26.010]  I like it.
[14:26.070 --> 14:26.810]  I think it's cool.
[14:27.270 --> 14:28.350]  I see too much.
[14:31.730 --> 14:32.910]  Andrew, would you do me a favor?
[14:33.030 --> 14:37.610]  Would you go to Green Plains GMH contract and accept taking stock of the damage?
[14:39.350 --> 14:40.530]  Uh, I sure can.
[14:40.630 --> 14:41.430]  Just one moment.
[14:41.590 --> 14:42.470]  Just so I can clock this.
[14:43.150 --> 14:43.670]  Get up there.
[14:43.970 --> 14:44.490]  Oh, my God.
[14:44.510 --> 14:45.210]  The map vanished.
[14:45.630 --> 14:47.090]  Oh, uh-oh.
[14:47.450 --> 14:47.870]  How do you?
[14:48.050 --> 14:50.630]  Oh, Gav, we have to go a long way around me.
[14:50.630 --> 14:53.590]  Oh, Gavin, there was a mud path back there.
[14:54.290 --> 14:54.770]  That was mud?
[14:55.130 --> 14:56.830]  Yeah, or dirt path.
[14:57.410 --> 14:57.770]  So we got to...
[14:57.770 --> 14:58.530]  Can we flip it back?
[14:59.750 --> 15:00.970]  Let's go have a look-see, shall we?
[15:01.570 --> 15:02.290]  Whoa, the map.
[15:03.410 --> 15:03.970]  Oh, my God.
[15:03.990 --> 15:04.790]  Is your map missing too?
[15:04.990 --> 15:05.210]  Yeah.
[15:07.070 --> 15:07.910]  Okay, I'll follow you.
[15:08.470 --> 15:08.710]  Okay.
[15:10.610 --> 15:11.150]  Oh, God.
[15:11.690 --> 15:12.510]  Oh, God, the map.
[15:15.690 --> 15:17.950]  It looks like the Earth is falling out from under us.
[15:18.730 --> 15:19.530]  Oh, my God.
[15:22.850 --> 15:25.930]  Oh, God.
[15:26.190 --> 15:26.930]  Oh, God.
[15:27.430 --> 15:28.110]  You're bouncing like a lemon.
[15:28.870 --> 15:30.190]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[15:30.810 --> 15:32.110]  Lemons known for their bouncing.
[15:32.870 --> 15:34.750]  Well, a lemon car might be.
[15:36.230 --> 15:37.690]  Yeah, imagine a car of lemons.
[15:38.070 --> 15:41.230]  All right, it looks like Andrew's pretty close to his watchtower.
[15:41.670 --> 15:42.090]  Oh, I see it.
[15:42.350 --> 15:43.650]  I physically see it.
[15:43.670 --> 15:45.410]  All right, I'm going to winch you up.
[15:46.710 --> 15:47.510]  Come on, big fella.
[15:47.510 --> 15:50.670]  Gavin and Nick working on their watchtower.
[15:51.830 --> 15:55.150]  I'm going to link up with you after I get this checkpoint, Andrew.
[15:56.130 --> 15:56.830]  Full speed ahead.
[15:56.950 --> 15:57.470]  Oh, God.
[15:58.370 --> 15:59.230]  I'm going to wheel drive.
[15:59.310 --> 15:59.530]  Oh, God.
[16:00.570 --> 16:01.310]  You all right there, Nick?
[16:02.430 --> 16:03.690]  Just going to back up a hair.
[16:04.670 --> 16:07.350]  Wow, this is really bouncy.
[16:08.250 --> 16:08.650]  Oh, okay.
[16:08.890 --> 16:09.410]  Same spot.
[16:09.530 --> 16:09.850]  All right.
[16:10.650 --> 16:11.290]  Just going to have to...
[16:11.950 --> 16:12.250]  Okay.
[16:12.390 --> 16:12.850]  Oh, well.
[16:15.490 --> 16:16.250]  You did a bit.
[16:19.310 --> 16:21.990]  Man, I haven't played this game in so fucking long.
[16:22.070 --> 16:22.950]  This is so much fun.
[16:23.170 --> 16:24.450]  Yeah, I feel rusty as shit.
[16:25.890 --> 16:27.230]  It's definitely pretty rusty.
[16:27.390 --> 16:29.130]  This is a good time watching, though.
[16:29.550 --> 16:31.710]  Part of why I haven't winched yet is because I'm rusty.
[16:32.030 --> 16:33.090]  I'm like, I don't know if I need to.
[16:33.870 --> 16:34.410]  Hey, Nick.
[16:35.010 --> 16:35.990]  I'm bad at that.
[16:36.450 --> 16:36.910]  Where are you?
[16:41.150 --> 16:41.510]  Let's...
[16:41.510 --> 16:42.050]  Oh, never mind.
[16:42.070 --> 16:42.370]  I'm fine.
[16:44.170 --> 16:44.810]  Are you sure?
[16:45.470 --> 16:46.570]  Yeah, he's coming back to you.
[16:46.570 --> 16:47.550]  Nothing happened.
[16:47.550 --> 16:50.790]  You know, Andrew, you and I are going to meet at the fourth checkpoint, which is convenient.
[16:51.490 --> 16:51.890]  So...
[16:51.890 --> 16:52.670]  Hell yeah.
[16:56.840 --> 16:57.980]  Oh, did I miss that?
[16:59.360 --> 17:01.680]  So how's it going over there, Gavin and Nick?
[17:01.720 --> 17:02.240]  Sounds good.
[17:02.600 --> 17:03.120]  Pretty good.
[17:03.180 --> 17:04.580]  We're just heading up a dirt path.
[17:05.060 --> 17:05.360]  Oh, yeah.
[17:05.400 --> 17:06.800]  I just drove right into a tree.
[17:06.820 --> 17:07.580]  Oh, my God.
[17:08.380 --> 17:08.780]  What?
[17:08.980 --> 17:09.360]  Where are you?
[17:09.940 --> 17:11.620]  You rubber banded on my screen.
[17:11.700 --> 17:12.360]  That was insane.
[17:13.160 --> 17:14.140]  Oh, okay.
[17:15.060 --> 17:16.280]  So am I ahead of you now on your screen?
[17:17.160 --> 17:17.340]  Yeah.
[17:17.660 --> 17:17.900]  Yeah.
[17:18.440 --> 17:18.800]  Yeah.
[17:19.680 --> 17:20.400]  Whoa, whoa.
[17:21.360 --> 17:22.180]  Uh oh, careful.
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.820]  You can pick up speed in this Hummer.
[17:26.280 --> 17:27.000]  Lemon mobile.
[17:34.440 --> 17:35.560]  Oh, deep water.
[17:36.240 --> 17:37.460]  How does it feel trucking again, Geoff?
[17:38.460 --> 17:41.060]  It feels so fucking good.
[17:41.380 --> 17:43.460]  I want as soon as I'm done here, I want to text
[17:43.940 --> 17:45.280]  Burndog and Antonio and be like,
[17:45.380 --> 17:46.300]  Oh, good job, guys.
[17:46.360 --> 17:46.820]  Good job.
[17:47.080 --> 17:48.120]  Or whoever that Andrew, was that you?
[17:48.220 --> 17:49.000]  That was us.
[17:49.360 --> 17:50.720]  That was an observation.
[17:50.920 --> 17:51.760]  That was them, yeah.
[17:52.720 --> 17:53.860]  Upgrade location discovered.
[17:54.820 --> 17:56.540]  So should we just move on to the next one of those?
[17:57.740 --> 17:58.660]  Uh, yeah, absolutely.
[17:58.760 --> 17:59.520]  I'm grabbing this one.
[17:59.560 --> 18:00.220]  Oh, so...
[18:00.220 --> 18:05.420]  I, uh, I played the other night with Antonio just for about an hour.
[18:05.660 --> 18:07.780]  First time we'd played together in all summer.
[18:07.880 --> 18:08.380]  It was a lot of fun.
[18:09.240 --> 18:09.860]  Where are we going, Gavin?
[18:10.560 --> 18:11.620]  This game is fucking great.
[18:11.760 --> 18:12.440]  I just needed a break.
[18:12.480 --> 18:13.940]  I needed a break from all the problems with it.
[18:14.140 --> 18:14.600]  I get it.
[18:16.260 --> 18:16.700]  There's a lot of problems.
[18:16.700 --> 18:19.440]  Do you see the one that's by central walls?
[18:22.680 --> 18:24.200]  There's so many things to do.
[18:24.740 --> 18:27.540]  Every time we unload, we unlock a watchtower.
[18:27.640 --> 18:28.560]  It'll give us new stuff to do.
[18:28.880 --> 18:29.240]  Crazy.
[18:29.540 --> 18:30.140]  Oh, yes, I do.
[18:30.200 --> 18:36.600]  Probably the most useful thing we could do is get vehicles for y'all.
[18:36.840 --> 18:38.580]  If there's any vehicles out there we can pick up.
[18:40.500 --> 18:42.960]  Should we go for a vehicle instead of the watchtower then?
[18:43.700 --> 18:47.940]  Well, the watchtower will alert you to where the vehicles are.
[18:47.940 --> 18:48.260]  OK.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.520]  I'm looking to see if I see any right now.
[18:51.220 --> 18:53.440]  I see an international HX520.
[18:54.120 --> 18:55.780]  That might be... where is that?
[18:55.880 --> 18:58.340]  Oh, or is that something I just left parked there?
[18:58.800 --> 19:00.900]  That's a truck that was left parked there.
[19:01.100 --> 19:02.360]  That was one of us.
[19:02.960 --> 19:03.100]  Oh.
[19:04.640 --> 19:07.580]  You can really see the vehicle.
[19:07.600 --> 19:09.200]  Do you want to go to this other watchtower, Gavin?
[19:09.620 --> 19:10.400]  Or are we going to central walls?
[19:10.400 --> 19:12.680]  Yeah, the one that's 750 away.
[19:12.960 --> 19:14.940]  I just have the general direction of where we need to go.
[19:15.000 --> 19:15.360]  Hey, man.
[19:18.520 --> 19:19.320]  Pool party?
[19:22.500 --> 19:26.020]  I want us to have our trucks hanging out in the pool, just floating.
[19:27.560 --> 19:29.360]  I think they would sink and be in the mud.
[19:29.420 --> 19:30.400]  I think it would be a mud party.
[19:30.840 --> 19:32.940]  Oh, these tires are buoyant.
[19:34.720 --> 19:37.620]  The only way to get rid of the Raccoon is through Gavin's pool.
[19:39.140 --> 19:42.100]  For us to all drive into it as trucks.
[19:42.100 --> 19:42.660]  Are you kidding me?
[19:42.700 --> 19:44.560]  The things in Gavin's pool right now is wasps.
[19:45.220 --> 19:47.080]  Oh yeah, they're in there.
[19:50.620 --> 19:51.360]  They're out of the fan.
[19:51.600 --> 19:52.220]  Stop putting your fan on.
[19:52.300 --> 19:53.160]  You're driving them to the pool.
[19:53.420 --> 19:53.580]  Yeah.
[19:55.440 --> 19:57.040]  The ones that survived relocated.
[19:57.200 --> 19:58.360]  Oh my wheels.
[19:58.600 --> 19:59.680]  It's those mud dobber things.
[19:59.740 --> 20:04.080]  So they they suck up pool and then they landed mud and gauze out water in it.
[20:04.140 --> 20:05.620]  And then they put the mud up on the house.
[20:07.020 --> 20:08.160]  So wonderful creatures.
[20:08.820 --> 20:11.220]  So to date this, this is the first week of October.
[20:11.220 --> 20:14.120]  I'm amazed that we had a pool.
[20:14.260 --> 20:16.260]  I went to two pool parties on Saturday.
[20:16.660 --> 20:20.420]  It's still 95 degrees every day in Austin right now.
[20:20.720 --> 20:21.140]  It's fucking...
[20:21.720 --> 20:22.740]  Can you give me a tug?
[20:23.160 --> 20:25.180]  Yeah, but it's 92 on Saturday.
[20:25.440 --> 20:26.540]  Yeah, Gavin needs a tug, dude.
[20:26.580 --> 20:29.040]  He's a pretty, pretty pleasant 92.
[20:29.260 --> 20:29.380]  Tug job.
[20:30.100 --> 20:34.520]  Yeah, because it's not it's not like humid, which is nice.
[20:35.140 --> 20:36.900]  I think summer officially ends on Halloween.
[20:37.900 --> 20:38.240]  Yeah.
[20:39.080 --> 20:39.740]  That I hope so.
[20:40.760 --> 20:41.520]  Let's see.
[20:41.600 --> 20:42.180]  There we are.
[20:42.520 --> 20:45.660]  I'm enjoying wearing shorts still this late in the year.
[20:45.920 --> 20:51.560]  All right, well, you don't understand, Andrew.
[20:51.920 --> 20:53.980]  R60 is like your negative five.
[20:54.920 --> 20:55.320]  Yeah.
[20:56.180 --> 20:57.680]  Hey, way to go, Nick.
[20:57.980 --> 20:58.600]  I got you, Gavin.
[21:00.100 --> 21:00.800]  Oh, no.
[21:01.400 --> 21:03.660]  I got you, I got you.
[21:04.200 --> 21:04.780]  I'm on my way.
[21:04.920 --> 21:06.240]  Geoff, what is this, your first day, dude?
[21:06.240 --> 21:06.860]  Come on.
[21:07.060 --> 21:08.200]  I got fuel, I got fuel.
[21:10.540 --> 21:11.140]  Oh, no.
[21:13.220 --> 21:13.840]  Oh, no.
[21:14.880 --> 21:15.900]  We did it.
[21:16.000 --> 21:16.800]  Oh, no.
[21:18.320 --> 21:19.480]  This is still the right way.
[21:19.740 --> 21:20.880]  Geoff, I crashed.
[21:21.480 --> 21:23.780]  I crashed, which means you'll get kicked out of your vehicles.
[21:24.540 --> 21:25.160]  Oh, there we go.
[21:25.500 --> 21:27.240]  I'm back in the garage.
[21:27.360 --> 21:28.620]  Do the vehicles stay where they are?
[21:29.560 --> 21:31.040]  They'll be there when I come back in.
[21:32.120 --> 21:32.680]  I believe.
[21:32.760 --> 21:33.840]  Oh, yeah, they're boring.
[21:34.040 --> 21:34.840]  Yeah, OK.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.300]  So let me quit the game and I'll need another invite.
[21:38.300 --> 21:40.360]  I got that from refueling myself.
[21:40.460 --> 21:42.900]  It sounds like the refuel bug is still in existence.
[21:42.940 --> 21:43.640]  That's a bummer.
[21:43.660 --> 21:44.760]  The refuel bug!
[21:45.220 --> 21:46.540]  Oh, my God.
[21:47.540 --> 21:49.820]  Yeah, sometimes when you refuel yourself, it kicks you out of the game.
[21:50.200 --> 21:50.960]  Oh, good, good, good, good.
[21:51.740 --> 21:52.840]  Sending you an invite.
[21:53.740 --> 21:54.340]  Be a second.
[21:54.640 --> 21:56.080]  Join it, if I can.
[21:56.800 --> 21:59.140]  Oh, thank God this game is still broken.
[21:59.980 --> 22:05.340]  Well, is it broken or did you give three of your trucks or two of your trucks to other people
[22:05.340 --> 22:07.440]  and it's just too much you all over the place?
[22:07.440 --> 22:08.040]  Could be.
[22:08.760 --> 22:09.040]  I don't know.
[22:09.060 --> 22:10.580]  I think it's supposed to work that way.
[22:11.620 --> 22:12.400]  It doesn't.
[22:12.580 --> 22:12.900]  I haven't.
[22:13.340 --> 22:19.320]  Whether I pulled those trucks out or not, it wouldn't have mattered.
[22:19.620 --> 22:20.600]  I was just refueling.
[22:20.940 --> 22:22.720]  Also, they're not going to be there when I get back.
[22:22.760 --> 22:23.240]  I just remembered.
[22:23.580 --> 22:24.200]  Oh, no.
[22:30.060 --> 22:31.200]  Oh, I should re-sync.
[22:31.480 --> 22:32.640]  One, two, three.
[22:32.900 --> 22:33.740]  One, two, three.
[22:34.560 --> 22:35.740]  Trucks is back, baby.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.020]  It's fucking loaded.
[22:39.500 --> 22:41.140]  Oh, oh my God.
[22:41.320 --> 22:41.500]  What happened?
[22:41.740 --> 22:42.620]  Holy shit.
[22:42.640 --> 22:43.120]  What?
[22:43.720 --> 22:45.220]  Did you not see that?
[22:45.360 --> 22:45.580]  No.
[22:45.900 --> 22:46.100]  What happened?
[22:47.180 --> 22:53.880]  On my screen, Gavin, you did a cartwheel over Nick and then ended up on here somehow.
[22:53.960 --> 22:54.740]  Wait, is Nick here?
[22:54.800 --> 22:55.600]  I didn't even see Nick.
[22:55.720 --> 22:56.440]  Gavin's here?
[22:57.280 --> 23:00.680]  Oh, so, Andrew, on their screens, they can't see each other.
[23:00.780 --> 23:01.840]  I'm looking at your screen.
[23:02.480 --> 23:04.800]  Gavin is on the back of...
[23:04.800 --> 23:05.160]  Oh, no.
[23:05.160 --> 23:05.640]  Oh, no.
[23:06.560 --> 23:07.260]  Oh, no.
[23:07.920 --> 23:08.780]  Oh, no.
[23:08.780 --> 23:09.200]  Oh, no.
[23:09.200 --> 23:09.220]  No, no.
[23:09.220 --> 23:09.720]  Why are you driving?
[23:09.900 --> 23:11.000]  I'm not packed on.
[23:11.100 --> 23:12.400]  No, Nick, keep going.
[23:13.240 --> 23:13.600]  Nick...
[23:13.600 --> 23:14.640]  Damn, it's in trouble.
[23:15.020 --> 23:16.280]  Gavin is straight up and down.
[23:16.740 --> 23:17.180]  Oh, no.
[23:17.180 --> 23:18.060]  Oh my God.
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.280]  Why don't you pack me in?
[23:19.280 --> 23:20.300]  I'm on the thing.
[23:20.500 --> 23:21.720]  I'm also on the thing.
[23:23.060 --> 23:25.460]  You have to look at Andrew's Discord.
[23:25.520 --> 23:27.260]  I'm on the handbrake.
[23:27.360 --> 23:27.900]  Oh my God.
[23:28.080 --> 23:28.400]  Oh!
[23:33.010 --> 23:33.450]  Oh!
[23:33.750 --> 23:33.970]  Oh!
[23:33.970 --> 23:34.090]  Oh!
[23:37.690 --> 23:37.730]  Oh!
[23:37.730 --> 23:37.810]  Oh!
[23:37.810 --> 23:37.950]  Oh!
[23:37.970 --> 23:39.990]  Water damages the truck.
[23:41.030 --> 23:44.770]  Well, I'm going to recover and then I'll make a new session to Geoff, hopefully.
[23:44.950 --> 23:45.390]  Yeah, do that.
[23:45.450 --> 23:48.030]  Hold on, I'm trying to rejoin off Gavin.
[23:48.190 --> 23:49.190]  We'll see if that works real fast.
[23:49.530 --> 23:49.830]  Okay.
[23:52.490 --> 23:53.430]  Oh my God.
[23:53.430 --> 23:54.970]  That was insane.
[23:55.490 --> 23:56.930]  That looked so cool.
[23:57.630 --> 23:58.050]  Oh, wow.
[24:00.890 --> 24:01.590]  I've turtled.
[24:02.310 --> 24:03.830]  If this doesn't work, I'm just going to...
[24:03.830 --> 24:06.610]  We can stop down and I'm just going to go find a taller window to jump out of.
[24:11.070 --> 24:11.690]  Let's fail.
[24:11.890 --> 24:14.050]  Hey, Andrew, can you come help me?
[24:15.010 --> 24:15.870]  Yeah, where are you?
[24:16.130 --> 24:16.490]  I'm...
[24:16.490 --> 24:16.830]  Still in the water?
[24:17.350 --> 24:18.890]  Well, I'm close to the water.
[24:19.330 --> 24:19.650]  I got you.
[24:19.930 --> 24:20.250]  Oh, wow.
[24:20.450 --> 24:21.810]  All right.
[24:21.810 --> 24:22.190]  Oh, shit.
[24:22.330 --> 24:22.550]  Gotcha.
[24:22.690 --> 24:23.430]  Why are you flying?
[24:23.830 --> 24:25.430]  Why, Andrew?
[24:25.430 --> 24:26.130]  You're doing a trick.
[24:26.250 --> 24:27.210]  You're doing a wheelie trick.
[24:27.370 --> 24:28.450]  You're doing magic.
[24:29.290 --> 24:29.650]  Magic!
[24:32.610 --> 24:32.970]  Alakazam!
[24:34.490 --> 24:35.370]  Well, you're...
[24:35.370 --> 24:38.110]  I would say what you just did matches the moose on your truck.
[24:40.910 --> 24:41.630]  One sec.
[24:43.930 --> 24:47.270]  I would honk my horn, but it seems to be dead.
[24:47.910 --> 24:48.530]  How are you...
[24:48.530 --> 24:49.910]  Are you on top of something, Andrew?
[24:50.230 --> 24:51.170]  He's on top of me.
[24:51.290 --> 24:51.550]  No.
[24:51.910 --> 24:52.130]  Oh.
[24:52.230 --> 24:52.630]  Yeah, he's...
[24:52.630 --> 24:53.190]  Yeah, he's on...
[24:53.190 --> 24:53.350]  Yeah.
[24:53.730 --> 24:54.570]  He's on me.
[24:55.170 --> 24:56.330]  No, it's magic!
[24:59.470 --> 25:00.650]  All right, I'm playing now too.
[25:00.730 --> 25:01.870]  There's vehicles for everybody.
[25:03.150 --> 25:03.830]  Scattered around.
[25:03.930 --> 25:04.510]  They're all good.
[25:06.150 --> 25:06.510]  Ah!
[25:07.170 --> 25:07.890]  I got out of your way.
[25:07.950 --> 25:08.190]  Sorry.
[25:09.530 --> 25:09.890]  No, fine.
[25:09.970 --> 25:10.490]  Here's an upgrade.
[25:10.630 --> 25:11.350]  We can get somebody.
[25:12.150 --> 25:13.050]  Oh, that looks rough.
[25:13.050 --> 25:13.410]  Oh, hell yeah.
[25:13.870 --> 25:14.590]  That looks rough.
[25:14.630 --> 25:17.050]  That's a bridge building, I think.
[25:17.650 --> 25:20.270]  I looked away for a second, and I've driven into a ditch.
[25:21.230 --> 25:21.850]  You had to build them.
[25:23.130 --> 25:26.270]  All right, where was that freaking watchtower at?
[25:26.750 --> 25:28.450]  Looks like Andrew's going...
[25:28.450 --> 25:29.870]  Are you going for that watchtower over there, Andrew?
[25:30.270 --> 25:32.170]  I'm going to the ninth checkpoint.
[25:32.390 --> 25:32.770]  Oh, okay.
[25:32.770 --> 25:34.410]  I didn't even know there was a watchtower over here.
[25:34.590 --> 25:34.870]  Okay.
[25:35.090 --> 25:36.930]  Well, then I'm going to go get that watchtower.
[25:39.790 --> 25:40.270]  Hey, Geoff.
[25:40.850 --> 25:41.290]  That's me.
[25:41.370 --> 25:41.670]  I'm Geoff.
[25:42.090 --> 25:44.110]  Can you help your buddy out?
[25:45.330 --> 25:45.910]  Yeah, sure.
[25:46.010 --> 25:46.630]  Hold on just a second.
[25:46.870 --> 25:47.130]  Oh, wait.
[25:48.210 --> 25:48.510]  Oh, wait.
[25:49.010 --> 25:49.470]  I may have...
[25:49.470 --> 25:49.590]  No.
[25:50.590 --> 25:51.550]  Yeah, let me help you out.
[25:51.890 --> 25:52.270]  Yeah, please.
[25:53.070 --> 25:53.230]  Whoops.
[25:53.370 --> 25:55.050]  All right, what vehicle are you in?
[25:56.870 --> 25:57.730]  Are you behind me?
[25:58.230 --> 26:01.030]  No, I'm like right in front of you to your left in the ditch.
[26:01.090 --> 26:01.690]  Are you in the drainage?
[26:02.190 --> 26:02.630]  That's me.
[26:06.570 --> 26:07.530]  Okay, goodbye, Gavin.
[26:07.750 --> 26:09.310]  Well, why don't you...
[26:09.310 --> 26:12.310]  Here, why don't you winch to my tail?
[26:12.810 --> 26:13.070]  Okay.
[26:13.250 --> 26:14.810]  Can you reach me from there?
[26:16.190 --> 26:17.270]  Okay, I'll pull you out.
[26:17.710 --> 26:18.870]  I should probably turn my lights on.
[26:20.170 --> 26:20.570]  Perfect.
[26:21.290 --> 26:22.090]  Thank you.
[26:22.170 --> 26:22.770]  No problem.
[26:22.870 --> 26:23.050]  Nice pull.
[26:25.050 --> 26:25.630]  Where am I going?
[26:26.670 --> 26:27.070]  Efficient.
[26:29.090 --> 26:34.530]  Oh, has Sigourney Weaver ever been in a film that's bound by the laws of reality?
[26:36.730 --> 26:37.170]  Ghostbusters.
[26:40.510 --> 26:41.670]  Yeah, he got it.
[26:41.790 --> 26:42.930]  I don't understand why everybody's laughing.
[26:45.650 --> 26:47.790]  I don't understand Gavin's question.
[26:47.970 --> 26:48.730]  Like, what happened?
[26:49.470 --> 26:49.870]  What do you mean?
[26:50.470 --> 26:52.910]  You're just saying like she's in like a lot of sci-fi movies?
[26:54.090 --> 26:55.450]  Yeah, she ever been in a normal movie?
[26:57.450 --> 26:58.250]  A normal movie?
[26:58.730 --> 27:00.170]  The Heartbreakers.
[27:00.250 --> 27:02.710]  A movie that could have existed in real life?
[27:04.910 --> 27:05.710]  Uh, Ghostbusters.
[27:05.890 --> 27:06.070]  Oh!
[27:06.350 --> 27:06.610]  Geoff!
[27:06.730 --> 27:07.130]  Oh, okay.
[27:07.250 --> 27:07.490]  Watch out.
[27:07.550 --> 27:07.710]  Oh!
[27:08.150 --> 27:08.770]  What are you doing, man?
[27:08.770 --> 27:10.030]  I'm in the ditch again, Geoff!
[27:12.450 --> 27:13.670]  Could Chappie have happened?
[27:15.770 --> 27:19.750]  I do like the idea of what is Sigourney Weaver's most mundane movie?
[27:20.130 --> 27:20.870]  It doesn't have to be mundane.
[27:22.390 --> 27:24.190]  Was she ever in a rom-com or anything?
[27:24.890 --> 27:26.430]  Was she in Dinner with Andre?
[27:28.530 --> 27:29.950]  Well, I want to know the answer now.
[27:30.650 --> 27:31.230]  I'm looking.
[27:33.030 --> 27:34.010]  What can I think of?
[27:35.930 --> 27:37.170]  Alien, Galaxy Quest.
[27:38.170 --> 27:39.710]  She's in Baby Mama.
[27:40.130 --> 27:41.510]  That, uh, Tina Fey movie.
[27:42.030 --> 27:42.390]  So...
[27:42.390 --> 27:42.510]  Oh!
[27:42.550 --> 27:42.830]  Oh, yeah!
[27:43.110 --> 27:43.630]  There you go.
[27:44.490 --> 27:45.970]  She's also in Be Kind, Rewind.
[27:46.030 --> 27:46.730]  I don't remember that.
[27:47.210 --> 27:47.450]  I don't know.
[27:47.450 --> 27:47.930]  I never saw that movie.
[27:47.930 --> 27:48.550]  Neither do I.
[27:48.670 --> 27:49.310]  I never saw it.
[27:49.330 --> 27:49.610]  I saw it in theaters.
[27:49.850 --> 27:50.950]  I thought that movie is like fun.
[27:51.090 --> 27:51.670]  It's Michelle Gondry.
[27:51.750 --> 27:51.970]  It's fun.
[27:52.150 --> 27:52.830]  Oh, she's in Holes.
[27:52.950 --> 27:53.710]  Holes could happen, right?
[27:54.590 --> 27:56.350]  She was a bad guy in Holes.
[27:57.350 --> 27:58.490]  Yeah, Holes could happen.
[27:58.990 --> 27:59.870]  What was she doing with the holes?
[28:00.510 --> 28:02.430]  She was the fucking head warden in charge.
[28:02.770 --> 28:03.210]  Making them dig them.
[28:03.430 --> 28:04.730]  Oh, um...
[28:04.730 --> 28:05.370]  She had, uh...
[28:06.150 --> 28:06.870]  The guy from Her Brother...
[28:06.870 --> 28:08.010]  Snake venom nail polish.
[28:09.150 --> 28:12.090]  She's in Heartbreakers with Jennifer Love Hewitt.
[28:13.250 --> 28:14.350]  Oh, that's right.
[28:15.530 --> 28:17.270]  I've said that six times.
[28:17.410 --> 28:17.890]  That's like...
[28:18.490 --> 28:20.030]  Did you say Heartbreakers?
[28:20.430 --> 28:20.690]  Yeah.
[28:20.690 --> 28:25.390]  I thought he was just, like, remarking on, like, the situation.
[28:26.570 --> 28:27.450]  I didn't...
[28:27.450 --> 28:29.030]  Yeah, I didn't quite understand, I think.
[28:29.110 --> 28:29.490]  I'm sorry.
[28:30.030 --> 28:30.470]  Heartbreakers.
[28:30.590 --> 28:30.750]  Yeah.
[28:31.670 --> 28:32.210]  Uh-oh.
[28:32.970 --> 28:37.730]  I'm not gonna say the H-word because I don't want to spoil it, but I am feeling it.
[28:38.210 --> 28:38.530]  Huge.
[28:39.550 --> 28:40.550]  Kind of like that.
[28:43.350 --> 28:44.250]  Gavin, let me, uh...
[28:44.250 --> 28:45.390]  What truck is sideways right now?
[28:45.770 --> 28:46.430]  Is that Gavin's?
[28:47.170 --> 28:50.990]  And then Nick is going to use his, like, little key truck to do what?
[28:51.610 --> 28:55.110]  Well, I was gonna go around through the mud, but it turns out this truck...
[28:55.910 --> 28:56.450]  Kind of low.
[28:58.910 --> 29:00.030]  So let me back up.
[29:00.510 --> 29:01.530]  I'll swing up to the top.
[29:02.090 --> 29:04.830]  Like, this is the kind of truck that Jordan was talking about, Nick.
[29:05.030 --> 29:07.590]  Like, it's like these are the trucks that him and Gus go crazy for.
[29:07.970 --> 29:08.370]  Weird.
[29:09.390 --> 29:10.010]  Jordan swears?
[29:10.470 --> 29:10.730]  Yeah.
[29:11.510 --> 29:13.110]  Gus goes crazy for trucks?
[29:13.690 --> 29:15.730]  These little key trucks, like the one that Nick has?
[29:16.710 --> 29:18.350]  Oh, the little Tatra or whatever that he's in?
[29:18.650 --> 29:20.890]  Yeah, like the, like, that's like his shit.
[29:21.150 --> 29:25.190]  And then they, he told us yesterday about a car called a, like, a street raccoon.
[29:27.870 --> 29:28.650]  People are weird.
[29:29.130 --> 29:30.610]  All right, let me get you up here, Gavin.
[29:31.570 --> 29:34.770]  And then when I Google it, it says, does car insurance cover hitting a raccoon?
[29:36.410 --> 29:37.550]  The car or the animal?
[29:37.710 --> 29:41.950]  Did you guys see that no insurer in the state of New York will insure a Tesla Cybertruck?
[29:42.270 --> 29:43.110]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[29:44.450 --> 29:44.770]  Why not?
[29:45.190 --> 29:45.970]  Oh, the Cybertruck.
[29:46.430 --> 29:47.290]  Too dangerous, I guess.
[29:47.450 --> 29:48.350]  Like, just doesn't work.
[29:48.590 --> 29:49.430]  Not worth the risk.
[29:49.890 --> 29:50.090]  Yeah.
[29:50.930 --> 29:55.850]  I don't think they're even legal in, to own in, like, European countries.
[29:56.350 --> 29:57.350]  Oh, I don't think so, yeah.
[29:58.810 --> 30:01.070]  Guy was like, I saw a subreddit, the guy was like,
[30:01.110 --> 30:04.170]  I'm the second person to own one in the state of New York and I can't fucking drive it.
[30:08.050 --> 30:10.850]  And they have that rule where you can't sell it in the first year.
[30:13.850 --> 30:15.250]  Which is also super cool, by the way.
[30:16.430 --> 30:17.290]  I know Lamborghini.
[30:17.910 --> 30:20.810]  Yeah, Lamborghini and those guys and other companies do shit like that, too.
[30:20.870 --> 30:24.110]  It's like, no, if you're going to buy it, you have to adhere to our,
[30:24.190 --> 30:27.010]  you can't sell it and make us look like you didn't like it.
[30:27.390 --> 30:29.030]  I think Ferrari is the worst when it comes to that.
[30:30.410 --> 30:34.150]  I think somebody, like, 50 cent or somebody got a lifetime ban
[30:34.650 --> 30:37.650]  from them because they bought and sold a car like in a couple of months.
[30:38.250 --> 30:38.850]  Oh, wow, really?
[30:39.230 --> 30:42.530]  Yeah, I think I'm probably getting that wrong, but I feel like I read that.
[30:45.130 --> 30:48.190]  Yeah, people have been sued by Ferrari for modding them and...
[30:48.190 --> 30:51.910]  Wow, what a weak piece of shit this truck is.
[30:53.110 --> 30:53.890]  Definitely not a Ferrari.
[30:54.310 --> 30:57.150]  I can't imagine being at the level where I'm buying Ferraris and then
[30:58.170 --> 30:59.430]  agreeing to rules like that.
[30:59.830 --> 31:00.410]  Yeah, no kidding.
[31:00.790 --> 31:01.110]  Hey, Gavin?
[31:02.210 --> 31:02.610]  Yes.
[31:03.130 --> 31:03.650]  I'll be right back.
[31:04.470 --> 31:04.810]  Okay.
[31:05.390 --> 31:07.750]  I'm gonna, this truck, this truck cannot pull you.
[31:08.970 --> 31:09.630]  It was...
[31:09.630 --> 31:11.290]  I don't think the truck is made for pulling, bud.
[31:13.230 --> 31:14.330]  Well, that's weird, it's a truck.
[31:16.750 --> 31:17.470]  Holy shit!
[31:17.590 --> 31:18.150]  It's not a pulling truck.
[31:18.430 --> 31:19.150]  What are you doing, Andrew?
[31:19.650 --> 31:21.350]  I'm just flipping these cars.
[31:21.510 --> 31:22.750]  Oh, yeah, these cars are, uh...
[31:23.630 --> 31:24.710]  They're so flippable.
[31:24.910 --> 31:26.870]  Floating in the air a little bit on my screen.
[31:28.390 --> 31:29.550]  What you doing over here, Geoff?
[31:29.650 --> 31:31.270]  I was gonna go to get the watchtower.
[31:32.190 --> 31:32.870]  Oh, sweet.
[31:32.870 --> 31:34.650]  I was gonna get a watchtower, then I saw Gavin.
[31:34.670 --> 31:35.170]  In your way.
[31:35.370 --> 31:36.930]  If I flip you over fully...
[31:36.930 --> 31:39.410]  It's, uh, trying to decide if I want to go...
[31:39.410 --> 31:41.390]  I guess I need to go around to the right.
[31:41.870 --> 31:42.410]  You know what?
[31:45.830 --> 31:46.730]  You doing okay?
[31:46.870 --> 31:47.630]  You need any help or anything?
[31:47.710 --> 31:48.010]  Are you good?
[31:48.390 --> 31:48.970]  I'm good.
[31:49.070 --> 31:50.710]  I'm just evaluating where to go next.
[31:50.810 --> 31:51.910]  Oh, I could just re...
[31:53.790 --> 31:55.550]  I'm gonna pop this watchtower and then...
[31:57.490 --> 31:58.350]  Yeah, you know what?
[31:58.450 --> 31:58.950]  Let's see what's up.
[31:59.570 --> 32:00.610]  Nope, nope, that's not what I wanted.
[32:01.330 --> 32:02.630]  I can't recover because it's Geoff.
[32:03.190 --> 32:04.570]  We only had a, uh...
[32:04.570 --> 32:05.270]  Well, you can re...
[32:05.790 --> 32:07.010]  I can recover it for you.
[32:07.730 --> 32:08.510]  Oh, with me in it?
[32:09.030 --> 32:09.270]  Nope.
[32:09.750 --> 32:11.190]  You have to get out of it and get another vehicle.
[32:11.390 --> 32:13.450]  And then I'll pull it back out again.
[32:14.370 --> 32:16.370]  It'd be a huge fucking pain in the ass.
[32:16.730 --> 32:17.650]  But I can do it.
[32:19.930 --> 32:20.590]  I'd hate it.
[32:20.610 --> 32:21.410]  It would fucking suck.
[32:21.510 --> 32:22.710]  But it's something you can do.
[32:23.190 --> 32:24.350]  Yeah, that's technically possible.
[32:25.530 --> 32:27.710]  And I can also just go drive the truck for you too.
[32:28.150 --> 32:28.710]  If you'd rather.
[32:29.230 --> 32:29.570]  What truck?
[32:30.790 --> 32:32.150]  The one that you want me to recover.
[32:32.890 --> 32:34.210]  It's upside down in a puddle.
[32:35.290 --> 32:36.210]  Use the winch.
[32:37.790 --> 32:39.990]  Can I winch when I'm upside down and the engine's off?
[32:40.350 --> 32:40.950]  The engine's dead.
[32:40.950 --> 32:41.890]  Not if the engine's off.
[32:42.050 --> 32:43.430]  Not unless you have an autonomous winch.
[32:44.290 --> 32:45.110]  I don't know if it does.
[32:45.550 --> 32:46.370]  You got one of those?
[32:47.510 --> 32:48.290]  They do exist.
[32:48.530 --> 32:49.730]  Can anybody go help Gavin?
[32:50.310 --> 32:50.790]  I try.
[32:50.910 --> 32:51.270]  Oh, you know what?
[32:51.330 --> 32:52.810]  Actually, Gavin, I can help you with this vehicle.
[32:53.750 --> 32:55.550]  Nick parked a truck next to me, which is nice.
[32:55.550 --> 32:55.890]  I did.
[32:57.010 --> 32:58.470]  Just wanted to make sure he wasn't lonely.
[33:00.430 --> 33:01.370]  I just want to...
[33:01.370 --> 33:02.030]  We're on our way to Gavin.
[33:03.450 --> 33:04.290]  I'm on my way, Gavin.
[33:05.130 --> 33:05.410]  Passing.
[33:05.810 --> 33:06.090]  Passing.
[33:06.230 --> 33:06.490]  No.
[33:06.670 --> 33:06.970]  Passing through.
[33:07.050 --> 33:07.470]  No, it's mine.
[33:07.710 --> 33:08.130]  Passing through.
[33:08.150 --> 33:08.510]  I want it.
[33:10.090 --> 33:11.250]  Is this a fucking road?
[33:11.250 --> 33:13.450]  Oh, I tried to side swipe you.
[33:13.590 --> 33:15.150]  How is this a road?
[33:15.590 --> 33:16.770]  What am I going to?
[33:18.430 --> 33:20.130]  There's no way that's a road.
[33:20.870 --> 33:21.310]  Okay.
[33:23.890 --> 33:25.250]  How you doing, Gavin?
[33:26.990 --> 33:28.430]  I can hear someone.
[33:29.070 --> 33:29.450]  That's good.
[33:29.910 --> 33:30.710]  Oh, hey, what's up, dude?
[33:33.770 --> 33:35.530]  You want to hit me with the ram scoop?
[33:37.170 --> 33:38.850]  Are you going for that watchtower, Geoff?
[33:39.670 --> 33:40.250]  I think so.
[33:41.710 --> 33:42.830]  Should I go for the other one, then?
[33:43.050 --> 33:44.050]  I'm not sure if I'm on a road.
[33:44.050 --> 33:44.750]  That's what I was going to do.
[33:44.810 --> 33:46.170]  I'm not sure if I'm on a road that's...
[33:47.570 --> 33:48.210]  I have...
[33:48.210 --> 33:50.330]  Are you going up to it or along it?
[33:52.790 --> 33:53.450]  I get it.
[33:53.490 --> 33:53.910]  That's fun.
[33:55.210 --> 33:57.850]  That was a little Jimi Hendrix joke.
[33:57.950 --> 33:58.770]  I'm having fun.
[33:59.330 --> 33:59.970]  James Hendrix.
[34:00.510 --> 34:01.490]  Oh, no, yes.
[34:01.750 --> 34:02.330]  Keep doing it.
[34:03.930 --> 34:04.590]  You nailed it.
[34:04.790 --> 34:05.270]  Come on, Andrew, you got it.
[34:05.270 --> 34:06.770]  There you go.
[34:06.850 --> 34:07.270]  Keep pulling.
[34:07.710 --> 34:09.210]  He weighs two pounds.
[34:09.330 --> 34:10.090]  Just keep pulling him.
[34:10.870 --> 34:12.570]  Oh, why didn't you turn?
[34:13.550 --> 34:14.450]  It wouldn't let me.
[34:14.530 --> 34:15.110]  It wouldn't let me.
[34:15.390 --> 34:17.970]  It wouldn't let you go left or right?
[34:18.670 --> 34:20.370]  Oh, it's because all the weight is carrying.
[34:23.370 --> 34:24.090]  There we go.
[34:26.130 --> 34:28.170]  I'm going to go unlock that other watchtower that's far away.
[34:28.490 --> 34:29.610]  Where's the fucking garage?
[34:29.750 --> 34:30.170]  There you go.
[34:30.230 --> 34:31.070]  There you go.
[34:31.130 --> 34:32.050]  Oh, wait, wait, closer.
[34:32.950 --> 34:33.870]  Okay, Gavin, you're all good.
[34:33.910 --> 34:34.190]  Bye.
[34:34.430 --> 34:35.090]  No, it's not.
[34:35.090 --> 34:36.490]  Good luck, Gavin.
[34:37.130 --> 34:37.850]  Andrew, wait.
[34:41.570 --> 34:42.550]  Can't catch me, Nick.
[34:43.230 --> 34:43.590]  No.
[34:43.850 --> 34:44.830]  I'm too fast.
[34:47.330 --> 34:49.170]  I'm all wheel driving on the road.
[34:49.190 --> 34:50.090]  Yeah, you're flying, bud.
[34:50.530 --> 34:51.390]  No, no headlights.
[34:55.930 --> 34:57.190]  What about one headlight?
[34:58.110 --> 34:58.490]  There we go.
[34:58.550 --> 34:59.190]  Oh, he turned them on.
[34:59.750 --> 35:01.710]  I don't think he realized that he didn't have any headlights.
[35:02.250 --> 35:04.510]  I realized it just trying to remember how to turn them on.
[35:04.510 --> 35:05.150]  What's headlights?
[35:05.790 --> 35:06.910]  Left bumper B.
[35:07.970 --> 35:10.090]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[35:10.330 --> 35:11.290]  They illuminate the road.
[35:12.090 --> 35:13.170]  Is that what they do?
[35:13.590 --> 35:15.390]  Oh, what are you doing?
[35:15.730 --> 35:16.710]  Oh, Andrew.
[35:16.990 --> 35:18.350]  I gotta adjust.
[35:18.650 --> 35:20.070]  Nick's trying to catch me.
[35:20.290 --> 35:22.830]  I think they caught you, didn't they?
[35:23.230 --> 35:24.050]  Did he not just pass you?
[35:24.530 --> 35:25.110]  Not at all.
[35:26.850 --> 35:30.850]  Did you ever go to France as a kid, but then you have to put the stickers on your headlights?
[35:33.190 --> 35:33.670]  What?
[35:33.670 --> 35:35.490]  The fuck are you talking about?
[35:36.570 --> 35:36.910]  Shit.
[35:37.910 --> 35:38.270]  Shit.
[35:41.210 --> 35:43.630]  I want to know what the France headlight thing was.
[35:43.710 --> 35:44.170]  What is that?
[35:44.390 --> 35:45.190]  What are you talking about?
[35:45.670 --> 35:47.190]  Well, if you drive to France, right?
[35:47.430 --> 35:48.970]  You suddenly drive it on the wrong side.
[35:49.670 --> 35:50.070]  Oh.
[35:50.430 --> 35:55.310]  And your headlights aimed into people's eyes.
[35:56.210 --> 35:57.950]  What? Is that real?
[35:58.390 --> 35:59.130]  I don't know about this.
[35:59.610 --> 36:01.950]  You put stickers on the headlights to aim them back.
[36:02.090 --> 36:02.610]  What a save.
[36:02.610 --> 36:03.090]  Oh, really?
[36:03.090 --> 36:04.290]  I've never heard this.
[36:05.850 --> 36:07.410]  Oh, what a save by me.
[36:07.770 --> 36:09.790]  Andrew, you're not going to get enough credit for that.
[36:10.270 --> 36:12.550]  You're not going to get enough credit for that.
[36:12.630 --> 36:13.390]  That was pretty incredible.
[36:13.610 --> 36:13.830]  Okay.
[36:14.010 --> 36:15.970]  That was pretty incredible, dude.
[36:16.130 --> 36:17.030]  Did I pass you?
[36:17.330 --> 36:17.550]  Nope.
[36:17.730 --> 36:18.770]  No, no, he's up ahead.
[36:19.670 --> 36:20.690]  This is some bullshit.
[36:20.810 --> 36:22.250]  I see a city, I think.
[36:22.350 --> 36:23.270]  Good luck with that, Nick.
[36:23.290 --> 36:23.710]  Have fun.
[36:23.850 --> 36:26.070]  Yeah, so you're going to want to...
[36:27.550 --> 36:28.590]  Yeah, Andrew's named.
[36:30.290 --> 36:30.730]  The...
[36:30.730 --> 36:33.430]  You're going to want to hug the left side, Nick.
[36:33.510 --> 36:35.910]  And then if you start falling, you better start winching.
[36:36.610 --> 36:37.450]  Oh, I see.
[36:37.990 --> 36:38.430]  Okay.
[36:39.150 --> 36:41.930]  I might just want to recover and get a different vehicle.
[36:42.510 --> 36:43.390]  Oh, you got...
[36:43.390 --> 36:44.890]  You got fucked by the...
[36:44.890 --> 36:45.410]  What happened?
[36:45.730 --> 36:46.470]  How did you hit that?
[36:46.870 --> 36:47.830]  I don't know.
[36:49.230 --> 36:49.490]  Uh-oh.
[36:49.950 --> 36:50.310]  Uh-oh.
[36:50.430 --> 36:51.110]  Oh, this is what happened.
[36:51.190 --> 36:51.990]  This is what happened with Andrew.
[36:52.210 --> 36:53.010]  Okay, I see.
[36:53.670 --> 36:54.030]  It's all right.
[36:54.290 --> 36:55.410]  Let's take a second.
[36:55.630 --> 36:56.710]  Let's evaluate the situation.
[36:57.350 --> 36:57.630]  Okay.
[36:58.730 --> 36:59.750]  Oh, there's a tree up there.
[37:02.250 --> 37:02.850]  There is.
[37:02.950 --> 37:03.550]  It's good for winching.
[37:04.050 --> 37:05.410]  If I refuel, does the game crash?
[37:07.350 --> 37:08.490]  Your game might crash.
[37:10.670 --> 37:12.850]  Wow, Nick, creative.
[37:12.990 --> 37:13.550]  One way to find out.
[37:13.570 --> 37:13.770]  Nope.
[37:14.570 --> 37:16.390]  Nick, I don't know why you did it that way.
[37:16.570 --> 37:17.050]  I don't either.
[37:18.430 --> 37:19.150]  Interesting question.
[37:25.810 --> 37:29.470]  So, hey, when your engine stalls, is that good and you want that?
[37:29.750 --> 37:29.950]  Yes.
[37:30.130 --> 37:30.390]  Huh?
[37:33.050 --> 37:34.510]  What are you guys on about?
[37:35.030 --> 37:35.790]  Uh, nothing.
[37:36.890 --> 37:37.450]  Oh, Geoff.
[37:37.890 --> 37:40.730]  Nick, you went back to your little thing.
[37:41.810 --> 37:42.210]  What's up, Gavin?
[37:43.070 --> 37:43.890]  I'm at the tower.
[37:44.530 --> 37:45.230]  Who said my name?
[37:45.390 --> 37:45.550]  Nick.
[37:45.650 --> 37:48.030]  Did you flip the Hummer again?
[37:48.650 --> 37:49.130]  Yeah, I did.
[37:49.130 --> 37:50.610]  Remember when I was screaming a little bit earlier?
[37:51.030 --> 37:51.290]  Oh, yeah.
[37:51.810 --> 37:52.210]  Yeah.
[37:53.490 --> 37:55.890]  Well, I'm going to go to a watchtower if any...
[37:55.890 --> 37:56.650]  Unless you flip it back.
[37:57.870 --> 37:58.610]  Uh, no.
[37:58.810 --> 37:59.430]  Still, I can try.
[37:59.590 --> 38:01.190]  Andrew just opened the watchtower, didn't he?
[38:01.830 --> 38:02.950]  I'm going for a different one.
[38:05.450 --> 38:06.270]  Good job, Andrew.
[38:10.310 --> 38:14.990]  Hey, Andrew, can you go back to the truck that I had that was following you and,
[38:15.090 --> 38:16.390]  you know, get it out of the...
[38:16.390 --> 38:18.050]  God, this Marshall is so badass.
[38:18.050 --> 38:23.210]  You use the wedge to hop the little ravine thing.
[38:24.490 --> 38:25.190]  I can try.
[38:29.480 --> 38:30.380]  Oh, hey, Gavin.
[38:30.860 --> 38:31.740]  Hey, what's up?
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.240]  I came to knock my truck over.
[38:34.360 --> 38:35.620]  Don't fall over, though, Geoff.
[38:35.720 --> 38:36.620]  Don't fall over.
[38:37.700 --> 38:38.120]  Geoff.
[38:40.900 --> 38:41.340]  Fuck.
[38:43.360 --> 38:44.260]  All right, I'm going to re...
[38:48.010 --> 38:50.250]  As I was saying, this Marshall is so badass.
[38:52.610 --> 38:53.410]  That again, better.
[38:54.390 --> 38:55.390]  What's everybody working on?
[38:56.390 --> 38:57.150]  Rolling my Hummer over.
[38:57.150 --> 38:57.970]  I just got to the...
[38:57.970 --> 38:58.490]  Yeah, I think...
[38:58.490 --> 39:02.190]  I think everyone's working on getting Gavin tipped back over.
[39:02.530 --> 39:06.090]  And by everyone, I mean Nick and Gavin, because Gavin has got a different car
[39:06.090 --> 39:07.730]  and is trying to push his other car.
[39:08.390 --> 39:09.770]  If I can get to the other side, we can...
[39:09.770 --> 39:10.990]  I think we can tag team this bitch.
[39:11.790 --> 39:13.090]  How are my wheels turning?
[39:14.530 --> 39:16.250]  Am I remote controlling the other one?
[39:16.330 --> 39:16.950]  Is someone in that?
[39:17.410 --> 39:17.690]  No.
[39:20.310 --> 39:22.430]  That sounded like I was being suspicious.
[39:22.610 --> 39:23.550]  No, there's nobody in that.
[39:25.110 --> 39:25.870]  I don't know if I trust him.
[39:26.710 --> 39:27.110]  Okay.
[39:27.530 --> 39:28.610]  Yeah, he sounds suspicious.
[39:28.630 --> 39:29.370]  Sounds pretty suspicious.
[39:29.750 --> 39:30.810]  Yeah, I wouldn't listen to me either.
[39:34.750 --> 39:35.690]  Up I go.
[39:37.130 --> 39:39.950]  Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.
[39:40.230 --> 39:40.950]  That was a mistake.
[39:41.310 --> 39:41.830]  Oh no.
[39:43.590 --> 39:45.570]  Go up, you worthless turd.
[39:45.950 --> 39:46.730]  Fuck, I did...
[39:46.730 --> 39:49.090]  All right.
[39:52.280 --> 39:53.280]  That's the winch.
[39:54.500 --> 39:55.300]  Oh, interesting.
[39:55.540 --> 39:57.680]  There's only those things to attach the winch to.
[39:58.040 --> 39:58.800]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[39:59.800 --> 40:02.400]  I thought if I ran that cannon in my fire...
[40:02.400 --> 40:04.220]  You thought maybe you'd shoot something off.
[40:04.260 --> 40:04.820]  I was just hoping.
[40:05.060 --> 40:07.160]  Yeah, I was hoping to just pop it off a little bit.
[40:08.220 --> 40:08.780]  Okay, Gavin.
[40:08.920 --> 40:09.560]  Here we go.
[40:10.240 --> 40:11.140]  Nope, no we don't, Gavin.
[40:11.760 --> 40:12.060]  You going?
[40:13.020 --> 40:13.740]  I'd like to.
[40:14.460 --> 40:15.480]  This one's busted.
[40:21.060 --> 40:21.200]  Okay.
[40:21.200 --> 40:21.380]  Cut.
[40:24.960 --> 40:27.940]  Go up, you dumb shit.
[40:34.580 --> 40:36.780]  I'm just sort of exploring Austria at this point.
[40:36.860 --> 40:37.680]  I don't really know.
[40:39.380 --> 40:41.120]  A job seems like a lot of work.
[40:41.280 --> 40:43.120]  I just want to enjoy the country.
[40:43.340 --> 40:46.680]  Yeah, when do you get the opportunity to go to a place like Austria and just enjoy it?
[40:48.100 --> 40:48.460]  Fuck!
[40:48.540 --> 40:49.440]  This is the first time.
[40:49.560 --> 40:52.060]  Yeah, you got to take the opportunities when they come.
[40:52.880 --> 40:53.240]  Mm-hmm.
[40:54.380 --> 40:57.040]  Like, uh, it sounds like Gavin and Nick are having a great time right now too.
[40:57.440 --> 40:58.280]  Oh, hey Gavin.
[40:58.300 --> 40:58.920]  Oh, they're hanging out.
[40:59.120 --> 40:59.520]  I'm really sorry.
[40:59.520 --> 41:00.000]  Just a couple of dudes.
[41:00.980 --> 41:01.960]  A couple of homies.
[41:04.360 --> 41:05.200]  Helping each other.
[41:07.680 --> 41:08.400]  Helping hands.
[41:08.560 --> 41:10.320]  Uh-oh, Geoff sucks again.
[41:10.700 --> 41:11.300]  I can't.
[41:14.480 --> 41:15.100]  Here we go.
[41:15.300 --> 41:15.780]  Here we go.
[41:16.100 --> 41:16.540]  Here we go.
[41:16.560 --> 41:16.740]  Okay.
[41:19.980 --> 41:21.160]  Why are you so weak?
[41:25.330 --> 41:26.510]  Can I come help you guys?
[41:26.590 --> 41:27.290]  Do you guys need help?
[41:27.310 --> 41:29.270]  No, I think we can do this.
[41:29.370 --> 41:29.830]  Okay.
[41:29.870 --> 41:30.890]  They desperately need help.
[41:33.170 --> 41:33.670]  No.
[41:34.050 --> 41:35.170]  What happened over here?
[41:36.430 --> 41:37.790]  Oh, this seems dangerous.
[41:38.450 --> 41:39.470]  I don't like this.
[41:41.190 --> 41:42.470]  How do I fix this?
[41:45.050 --> 41:45.810]  Show task.
[41:46.890 --> 41:49.090]  My guy looks a little bit slumped over and dead.
[41:49.990 --> 41:51.990]  He looks it or he is it?
[41:52.710 --> 41:54.510]  I don't think I've actually died.
[41:54.890 --> 41:57.450]  Are you hurt or are you injured?
[42:00.850 --> 42:02.170]  Okay, Gavin, here we go.
[42:03.310 --> 42:06.070]  I hope someday we get the opportunity to do this in real Austria.
[42:06.590 --> 42:06.950]  I hope.
[42:07.110 --> 42:09.210]  Oh, maybe not with the vehicles, though.
[42:09.690 --> 42:12.110]  No, I just mean play the video game, but do it while we're in Austria.
[42:12.550 --> 42:13.110]  Oh, yeah, perfect.
[42:15.570 --> 42:17.750]  Turn on engine on winch truck.
[42:17.910 --> 42:18.930]  Don't explore Austria at all.
[42:19.010 --> 42:21.270]  Just go to Austria to play SnowRunner in Austria.
[42:21.270 --> 42:23.430]  Well, there's probably better latency, don't you think?
[42:23.550 --> 42:23.830]  Yeah.
[42:24.030 --> 42:24.710]  Oh, you would think.
[42:24.710 --> 42:28.090]  We'll explore room service and all that kind of stuff in the hotel.
[42:28.490 --> 42:29.410]  We'll explore the internet.
[42:32.730 --> 42:35.490]  Nick, they need help so bad, Geoff.
[42:37.510 --> 42:40.170]  This freaking piece of dog shit.
[42:40.690 --> 42:44.070]  All right, I winched to the thing and flipped myself over.
[42:44.670 --> 42:47.250]  Nick rolled over like a turtle and my guy didn't even wake up.
[42:48.110 --> 42:52.070]  I'm in a thing, but as soon as I get to a safe spot...
[42:52.070 --> 42:53.150]  I hope my driver died.
[42:55.510 --> 42:57.430]  All right, all right, all right.
[42:57.430 --> 42:58.230]  Hey, Gavin, you're welcome.
[42:58.790 --> 42:59.250]  Beautiful.
[42:59.950 --> 43:02.390]  Are you allowed to abandon your car in real life?
[43:05.430 --> 43:06.350]  Sort of.
[43:09.590 --> 43:13.110]  It really depends on like kind of like the wear and all that.
[43:13.130 --> 43:15.950]  Like you can't just suddenly get out of your car.
[43:16.090 --> 43:17.130]  Could I just be like, nah.
[43:20.190 --> 43:24.050]  Yes, but it could be found and like linked back to you
[43:24.050 --> 43:27.790]  and you have like fees to pay and like all that kind of stuff.
[43:27.830 --> 43:30.430]  Here's what you're going to want to do.
[43:30.430 --> 43:31.710]  The city, the county, the parish.
[43:32.810 --> 43:33.930]  You shouldn't do this.
[43:34.750 --> 43:35.490]  You shouldn't do this.
[43:35.490 --> 43:36.450]  You shouldn't abandon a vehicle.
[43:36.550 --> 43:39.270]  But if you're going to, you need to take all the identifying
[43:39.270 --> 43:40.410]  information out of the glove box.
[43:40.510 --> 43:40.610]  Yeah.
[43:41.030 --> 43:41.210]  Yeah.
[43:41.250 --> 43:44.970]  You need to get a flathead screwdriver to either
[43:44.970 --> 43:46.810]  scrape the VIN or pop the VIN out.
[43:46.930 --> 43:48.250]  And then you got to get rid of the VIN.
[43:48.550 --> 43:50.390]  And then you just you can probably walk in.
[43:50.390 --> 43:56.290]  Yeah, at that point, get rid of the get rid of the
[43:56.830 --> 43:58.830]  if you haven't already, get rid of the license plates as well.
[43:58.850 --> 44:01.050]  Well, duh, obviously, you know what?
[44:01.190 --> 44:03.310]  You know what trips people up sometimes, too,
[44:03.350 --> 44:06.410]  is the stickers on the inside of your door that you never think about.
[44:06.430 --> 44:07.530]  Yeah, there or whatever.
[44:07.910 --> 44:08.930]  Typically, you just want to scrape.
[44:09.050 --> 44:10.690]  Those can be identified also.
[44:12.410 --> 44:15.690]  Sometimes there's other identifying information on some of that stuff.
[44:15.810 --> 44:18.690]  I'm watching Nick's screen and it's just a bunch of abandoned vehicles
[44:18.690 --> 44:20.110]  like upside down in the mud.
[44:20.110 --> 44:20.890]  It's pretty great.
[44:23.130 --> 44:26.190]  Scraping like metal in boss numbers is never a felony.
[44:26.510 --> 44:28.190]  That's yeah, you know, it's normal.
[44:28.510 --> 44:33.170]  Anyway, if you do most of those things, you can probably get away with it.
[44:33.590 --> 44:38.510]  Just based on where some vehicles are abandoned around my neighborhood,
[44:38.950 --> 44:40.710]  you can definitely get away with it.
[44:40.850 --> 44:44.130]  Just based on having the look of them, you know, it is what it is.
[44:44.490 --> 44:44.830]  You passed.
[44:44.870 --> 44:47.390]  It sounds like a life hack to not pay truck late fee.
[44:47.550 --> 44:47.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:47.950 --> 44:51.490]  Another way to do it would be to buy a car under the table
[44:51.490 --> 44:54.070]  and never register it or get insurance on it.
[44:54.130 --> 44:57.890]  So there's no get no, no title, no insurance like you just have the car,
[44:57.970 --> 44:59.990]  get the paper plates like they do out here in Texas.
[44:59.990 --> 45:03.110]  And then that's also one of those things that you probably shouldn't do.
[45:03.330 --> 45:04.610]  Yeah, you should not do that.
[45:05.130 --> 45:05.970]  We're just telling you.
[45:07.290 --> 45:08.330]  Just answer the question.
[45:08.610 --> 45:10.670]  Yeah, paper plates are pretty nuts as a concept.
[45:11.010 --> 45:13.610]  It's it's the correct moving out here.
[45:13.730 --> 45:14.790]  And that's the thing.
[45:14.870 --> 45:16.150]  I think it's the craziest thing in the world.
[45:17.150 --> 45:17.730]  It's what?
[45:18.070 --> 45:18.970]  I think they're doing away with them.
[45:19.350 --> 45:19.970]  They better.
[45:20.490 --> 45:21.830]  Get rid of most single use stuff.
[45:26.010 --> 45:26.410]  Dumb.
[45:26.970 --> 45:27.330]  Stupid.
[45:32.170 --> 45:34.430]  What the fuck is going on over here?
[45:34.770 --> 45:35.550]  Oh, I woke up.
[45:35.750 --> 45:36.270]  I'm alive.
[45:37.370 --> 45:38.310]  Is that you on the ground?
[45:38.410 --> 45:39.050]  I'm rolling over.
[45:39.430 --> 45:39.650]  Yeah.
[45:40.370 --> 45:40.930]  Oh, OK.
[45:41.030 --> 45:41.370]  There you go.
[45:41.450 --> 45:42.050]  Yeah, flip them over.
[45:42.370 --> 45:43.930]  Is that the truck I got for you?
[45:44.010 --> 45:45.470]  How have you put me like this?
[45:45.470 --> 45:46.030]  What the fuck?
[45:46.930 --> 45:48.850]  Nick, move your camera.
[45:50.510 --> 45:51.250]  You ready for me?
[45:51.550 --> 45:54.150]  OK, so he's winched, but he's straight up and wait, there's no.
[45:54.890 --> 45:55.950]  What am I stuck on?
[45:56.290 --> 45:59.930]  You see, do you see your rock is inside of you?
[46:00.950 --> 46:02.070]  I'm like, blow up, right?
[46:02.150 --> 46:05.270]  I'm stood like, yeah, yeah, I can't seem to pull you.
[46:05.470 --> 46:05.730]  Let's see.
[46:05.810 --> 46:06.750]  I can't Nick.
[46:06.930 --> 46:07.530]  I don't see Geoff.
[46:07.590 --> 46:08.290]  Do you see Geoff?
[46:08.650 --> 46:10.090]  Oh, OK, so Nick dropped.
[46:10.490 --> 46:12.010]  That's OK.
[46:12.290 --> 46:13.610]  I'm like, man, he's not talking.
[46:13.670 --> 46:14.390]  It's fucking weird.
[46:16.830 --> 46:18.250]  I'm I'm like the end of that shit.
[46:18.350 --> 46:19.210]  James Bond film.
[46:21.030 --> 46:21.490]  Nick.
[46:23.510 --> 46:23.970]  Nick.
[46:24.470 --> 46:25.890]  Yeah, this video is good.
[46:26.010 --> 46:27.610]  Really well, guys, this is bad.
[46:27.850 --> 46:28.550]  This is guys.
[46:28.610 --> 46:34.650]  Welcome to a Patreon exclusive video that is largely probably edited through trash on Patreon.
[46:35.010 --> 46:36.530]  I think this is a good video.
[46:36.530 --> 46:37.830]  This is coming out, dude.
[46:38.170 --> 46:40.070]  This is for the sickos coming out.
[46:40.130 --> 46:41.050]  And here's why.
[46:41.270 --> 46:43.690]  So when people say, why don't you guys play trucks anymore?
[46:43.750 --> 46:44.910]  We can point to this video.
[46:44.910 --> 46:46.850]  OK, this is a good video.
[46:46.930 --> 46:47.410]  We can say.
[46:48.070 --> 46:49.790]  I don't know if it's a good video.
[46:50.090 --> 46:54.730]  Because we have to take 22 minutes off in the middle of the video to get me back in the game.
[46:55.150 --> 46:55.290]  Yep.
[46:55.450 --> 46:57.750]  Yeah, and then I got stuck up on my end.
[46:58.070 --> 47:00.730]  Gavin is fused into the universe.
[47:01.010 --> 47:01.870]  I can't pull him out.
[47:03.670 --> 47:04.670]  Oh, you're doing it.
[47:05.050 --> 47:06.070]  I'm flipping over there.
[47:06.210 --> 47:07.230]  Oh, my shadow just did it.
[47:07.630 --> 47:09.990]  What do you guys think Nick is doing?
[47:10.870 --> 47:11.850]  I don't know.
[47:12.950 --> 47:13.610]  Are you all right?
[47:13.610 --> 47:14.510]  You're upside down now.
[47:14.510 --> 47:14.830]  All right.
[47:16.110 --> 47:17.290]  Where are you going, by the way?
[47:18.950 --> 47:20.030]  Oh, you almost had me.
[47:20.190 --> 47:20.650]  You let go.
[47:21.310 --> 47:21.650]  Oh, OK.
[47:23.850 --> 47:24.490]  Oh, fuck.
[47:25.870 --> 47:26.230]  I mean.
[47:34.140 --> 47:34.840]  Oh, come on.
[47:34.920 --> 47:35.180]  Come on.
[47:35.220 --> 47:35.960]  There we go.
[47:36.980 --> 47:39.340]  I still haven't thought about what I'm going to put in my crime capsule.
[47:40.320 --> 47:41.720]  Oh, you really got to think about that.
[47:42.140 --> 47:42.780]  Yeah, you really do.
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.020]  Oh, man, Gav.
[47:51.100 --> 47:52.200]  I have you, but...
[47:53.040 --> 47:55.440]  Maybe you just slam me as hard as...
[47:57.220 --> 47:58.980]  Oh, I'm upside down again.
[48:01.980 --> 48:03.760]  It should be first person, really, I think.
[48:04.820 --> 48:08.520]  Oh, oh, is that doing anything?
[48:09.680 --> 48:11.000]  I'm eating mud.
[48:11.380 --> 48:12.180]  There's mud in my mouth.
[48:14.160 --> 48:16.260]  There's what looks like a poo on my windscreen.
[48:16.420 --> 48:17.360]  Oh, it's coming in.
[48:17.480 --> 48:18.600]  It's coming in the car.
[48:20.100 --> 48:20.500]  Whee!
[48:21.300 --> 48:22.460]  All right, here we go.
[48:22.640 --> 48:23.880]  I'm going to flip you back over now.
[48:24.260 --> 48:25.220]  So are you like...
[48:25.220 --> 48:27.200]  Are you supposed to be delivering this truck?
[48:27.300 --> 48:27.920]  Is that it, Andrew?
[48:27.920 --> 48:29.000]  I'm delivering the truck.
[48:29.020 --> 48:30.540]  OK, so you've been doing that.
[48:30.660 --> 48:33.880]  But like, why didn't you just flatbed it, put it on your truck?
[48:34.720 --> 48:35.240]  Thanks, Geoff.
[48:35.380 --> 48:36.340]  Probably would have been a good idea.
[48:36.460 --> 48:37.300]  Yeah, man, no problem. I'm going to follow behind you.
[48:37.300 --> 48:38.460]  Oh, you've just been dragging it?
[48:38.540 --> 48:39.740]  You just didn't think about that?
[48:40.300 --> 48:41.020]  Hey, it's Nick.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.140]  Hey, it's Nick.
[48:42.940 --> 48:43.680]  What'd you do?
[48:45.420 --> 48:47.900]  I walked away for two seconds, came back, and it worked.
[48:48.280 --> 48:48.780]  He's eating.
[48:48.940 --> 48:49.760]  He got a snack.
[48:49.760 --> 48:50.680]  He's eating something.
[48:50.940 --> 48:52.920]  Nick fixed his computer via the kitchen.
[48:53.700 --> 48:54.840]  We're at work.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.020]  We are in the middle of filming a video.
[48:57.300 --> 48:58.480]  We are at the office.
[48:58.760 --> 49:01.120]  And Nick is in the middle of snacking.
[49:01.560 --> 49:02.340]  What kind of kitchen?
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.020]  You're not snacking.
[49:05.380 --> 49:05.720]  That's a mint.
[49:07.040 --> 49:08.360]  That was a chewy mint.
[49:08.520 --> 49:08.920]  That TikTok?
[49:09.440 --> 49:09.600]  Yeah.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.480]  Geoff, did you abandon these vehicles?
[49:14.880 --> 49:17.400]  No, I got Gavin's right side up.
[49:17.500 --> 49:18.360]  Isn't that what I was supposed to do?
[49:18.460 --> 49:19.040]  Oh, shit.
[49:19.040 --> 49:20.620]  I wasn't even trying to...
[49:20.620 --> 49:21.600]  Gavin, you didn't have...
[49:21.600 --> 49:22.500]  Geoff, help me.
[49:23.200 --> 49:23.580]  Oh, yeah.
[49:23.640 --> 49:24.580]  Nobody helped Nick.
[49:24.780 --> 49:26.000]  Wait, you guys just left?
[49:26.240 --> 49:28.680]  I only got this truck out to knock over my harness.
[49:28.680 --> 49:29.560]  You guys just left?
[49:30.320 --> 49:33.040]  Oh, I thought I was helping get Gavin out.
[49:33.380 --> 49:33.680]  And then that was it.
[49:33.680 --> 49:34.760]  You're trying to help get...
[49:34.760 --> 49:36.200]  You're trying to get Nick also.
[49:36.540 --> 49:38.140]  Oh, well, I'll go back and get Nick now.
[49:38.620 --> 49:38.820]  Please.
[49:39.120 --> 49:40.120]  Yeah, I forgot about Nick.
[49:40.300 --> 49:42.220]  And I forgot what I was doing there with this truck.
[49:42.520 --> 49:43.380]  Oh, my God.
[49:43.560 --> 49:44.500]  Where did that truck come from?
[49:44.520 --> 49:45.040]  Is that your truck?
[49:45.080 --> 49:46.140]  Oh, make it, make it, make it.
[49:46.220 --> 49:46.580]  The pickup?
[49:46.780 --> 49:47.140]  Yeah.
[49:47.300 --> 49:47.900]  Nice, Andrew.
[49:47.900 --> 49:48.880]  Yeah, I bought it twice.
[49:49.660 --> 49:51.660]  Geoff, I'm going to switch to the Hummer here.
[49:52.800 --> 49:54.400]  All right, I'm headed back to...
[49:54.400 --> 49:55.320]  Oh, shit.
[49:56.640 --> 49:58.420]  If only you'd have spoken up.
[49:58.980 --> 49:59.880]  That's what I'm saying.
[50:00.240 --> 50:01.220]  I would love to say something.
[50:01.400 --> 50:02.300]  He's getting a snack.
[50:03.560 --> 50:06.080]  No, he had a mouthful of a mint.
[50:08.820 --> 50:10.000]  Why don't you put it that way?
[50:10.060 --> 50:11.480]  I can see my favorite brand.
[50:11.900 --> 50:12.780]  Mouthful of mint.
[50:13.520 --> 50:13.980]  Hey, there you go.
[50:14.200 --> 50:16.080]  You want one large mint?
[50:16.520 --> 50:17.720]  You got real bad breath.
[50:17.880 --> 50:18.860]  We should sell that.
[50:19.420 --> 50:21.180]  Nobody's ever sold mouth of mint.
[50:21.280 --> 50:22.040]  Oh my god.
[50:22.040 --> 50:22.460]  Mouth of mint.
[50:23.940 --> 50:25.460]  That's great, Andrew.
[50:26.280 --> 50:27.680]  Yeah, that's great, Andrew.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  All right, there you go.
[50:29.180 --> 50:29.700]  Too much.
[50:30.060 --> 50:30.660]  Too many beans.
[50:31.780 --> 50:33.240]  I'll just dump you.
[50:34.340 --> 50:35.540]  I only see Gavin.
[50:36.420 --> 50:38.780]  Well, I'm currently fucking your hood.
[50:39.720 --> 50:40.020]  Oh, okay.
[50:40.120 --> 50:40.780]  Who's in my Hummer?
[50:41.480 --> 50:41.900]  I am.
[50:42.420 --> 50:44.020]  Oh, it should be good.
[50:45.380 --> 50:46.340]  What else can I do?
[50:47.620 --> 50:48.140]  It should be good.
[50:48.200 --> 50:48.780]  It's on its side.
[50:49.480 --> 50:50.880]  On my screen, it's right side up.
[50:51.420 --> 50:52.220]  Oh, oh.
[50:54.140 --> 50:54.500]  Hummer.
[50:54.580 --> 50:55.360]  Can people play this game?
[50:55.880 --> 50:56.560]  And it works?
[50:56.900 --> 50:57.540]  But I'm crazy.
[50:57.740 --> 50:59.020]  It's working great for me.
[50:59.720 --> 51:00.540]  Oh, you're by your own.
[51:00.800 --> 51:01.260]  By your own?
[51:01.440 --> 51:01.460]  Yeah.
[51:01.540 --> 51:02.540]  That's how my kid says it.
[51:09.640 --> 51:10.860]  So what is...
[51:10.860 --> 51:12.480]  What are you seeing on your screen right now, Gavin?
[51:13.520 --> 51:14.860]  Nick on his side.
[51:15.160 --> 51:15.360]  Yeah.
[51:15.420 --> 51:16.280]  And you're pulling me out.
[51:16.680 --> 51:17.560]  An upside down truck.
[51:18.320 --> 51:20.720]  Is there a Tatra attached to the side of you, Gavin?
[51:21.960 --> 51:22.360]  No.
[51:23.180 --> 51:23.580]  Oh, weird.
[51:23.700 --> 51:24.440]  There isn't my screen.
[51:24.820 --> 51:27.020]  Uh, and Nick, you are on your side, you say?
[51:27.240 --> 51:27.740]  I am.
[51:29.900 --> 51:31.660]  You are right side up on my screen.
[51:32.180 --> 51:32.860]  Happy as can be.
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.040]  Am I shoving you right now?
[51:34.100 --> 51:35.640]  Are you flopping around?
[51:36.020 --> 51:36.640]  On my side.
[51:37.600 --> 51:38.780]  No, he's just on his side.
[51:39.920 --> 51:40.700]  Wow, dude.
[51:41.440 --> 51:43.940]  Uh, Gavin, I think Gavin got dropped.
[51:44.520 --> 51:45.000]  No, I didn't.
[51:46.960 --> 51:48.140]  All right, I'm just gonna pull you.
[51:48.580 --> 51:48.940]  Wait, what?
[51:51.380 --> 51:53.620]  Why did he... did he text that?
[51:54.020 --> 51:54.620]  What's going on?
[51:55.400 --> 51:55.620]  Gavin?
[51:56.340 --> 51:56.920]  Gavin, help.
[51:56.940 --> 51:58.440]  I'm right here, I'm just sat in my truck.
[51:58.860 --> 52:00.380]  Then why'd you text us that you got dropped?
[52:02.960 --> 52:04.220]  Oh, all the cars are moving.
[52:05.560 --> 52:06.880]  Well, I'm moving Nick down the road.
[52:06.880 --> 52:08.600]  None of the cars... wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[52:08.780 --> 52:09.760]  Whoa, whoa.
[52:09.820 --> 52:10.640]  Did you see that, Nick?
[52:10.760 --> 52:11.500]  Oh, I see it.
[52:11.740 --> 52:12.320]  Oh, I'm flipping.
[52:13.020 --> 52:14.540]  What's going on?
[52:15.760 --> 52:16.120]  Whoa!
[52:17.340 --> 52:18.100]  Oh, fuck.
[52:19.380 --> 52:21.360]  I have no idea what's going on.
[52:21.380 --> 52:22.900]  But I took Nick, I took the...
[52:22.900 --> 52:24.600]  Oh, holy shit!
[52:28.620 --> 52:31.440]  We're... there are dramatically different things going on.
[52:33.060 --> 52:34.840]  There's so much weird shit happening.
[52:35.080 --> 52:39.680]  I just very calmly drove the Humvee down the road about a quarter mile.
[52:39.880 --> 52:40.540]  Oh, wow.
[52:40.600 --> 52:41.260]  That was crazy.
[52:41.820 --> 52:42.780]  Stage complete, guys.
[52:42.820 --> 52:43.500]  Way to go.
[52:43.900 --> 52:44.660]  Hell yeah.
[52:45.340 --> 52:45.900]  So are you...
[52:45.900 --> 52:46.540]  We did it.
[52:46.660 --> 52:48.300]  Nick, are you in the Humvee?
[52:48.620 --> 52:49.160]  I am.
[52:49.480 --> 52:50.180]  And where is it?
[52:51.380 --> 52:52.360]  It's in the river.
[52:53.120 --> 52:54.820]  Where's the car you were driving though?
[52:54.860 --> 52:55.600]  Because I was in that.
[52:56.780 --> 52:57.280]  You want to...
[52:57.280 --> 52:58.440]  Oh, you want me to get out again?
[52:58.700 --> 52:59.000]  Here, I'll...
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.520]  No, definitely get out and switch around because you are...
[53:03.180 --> 53:04.600]  What I'm seeing and what you guys...
[53:04.600 --> 53:06.980]  Where you guys are seeing the cars are dramatically different places.
[53:07.160 --> 53:09.100]  It's right here in the water next to it.
[53:11.780 --> 53:12.780]  I see Nick in the water.
[53:12.820 --> 53:13.000]  What the fuck?
[53:13.040 --> 53:13.520]  How weird.
[53:14.360 --> 53:15.840]  Oh, I'm in the Hummer now.
[53:16.380 --> 53:17.120]  And where's the Hummer?
[53:17.660 --> 53:19.000]  Just parked to the side of the stream.
[53:19.480 --> 53:20.180]  Let me get over there.
[53:20.680 --> 53:21.540]  Whoa, it moved.
[53:21.660 --> 53:22.280]  Holy shit.
[53:22.820 --> 53:24.700]  When you got in it, it bounced back.
[53:25.400 --> 53:25.480]  Crazy.
[53:26.880 --> 53:28.160]  I had driven it way down the road.
[53:28.260 --> 53:29.200]  But you're driving it around now.
[53:29.360 --> 53:29.520]  Help me.
[53:30.080 --> 53:30.280]  Help me.
[53:30.960 --> 53:32.040]  What are you in, Nick?
[53:33.340 --> 53:35.520]  Uh, the Tatra 805.
[53:35.840 --> 53:36.160]  Okay.
[53:36.480 --> 53:38.440]  And are you upside down or like what?
[53:38.500 --> 53:39.300]  No, just in the water.
[53:39.460 --> 53:39.680]  I'm...
[53:39.680 --> 53:40.360]  Oh, Gavin pulled me out.
[53:40.460 --> 53:40.840]  Thank you, Gavin.
[53:41.400 --> 53:41.740]  Did I?
[53:42.720 --> 53:43.520]  I pulled you...
[53:43.520 --> 53:44.300]  Myself out on you.
[53:45.420 --> 53:47.120]  Oh, I was wondering where that winch came from.
[53:47.360 --> 53:48.780]  Are you following along with Gavin?
[53:50.660 --> 53:51.020]  Uh...
[53:51.020 --> 53:51.920]  Or are you doing something else?
[53:52.420 --> 53:54.040]  Oh, I think I'm driving into you.
[53:54.720 --> 53:55.300]  Oh, okay.
[53:56.280 --> 53:58.540]  You're just parked on my screen, of course, but...
[54:00.500 --> 54:02.300]  Holy shit, what's going on over here?
[54:02.320 --> 54:03.120]  Oh my god.
[54:06.220 --> 54:07.340]  Not a lot on my screen.
[54:07.440 --> 54:08.040]  It's pretty calm.
[54:09.100 --> 54:10.440]  Do you see Geoff here, Andrew?
[54:11.180 --> 54:12.380]  Yeah, I see Geoff up ahead.
[54:13.260 --> 54:13.620]  That's me.
[54:13.680 --> 54:15.240]  In a big-ass truck going up the hill.
[54:16.060 --> 54:18.120]  I see an orange truck next to me.
[54:18.120 --> 54:18.900]  Yeah, right next to you?
[54:19.340 --> 54:19.540]  Struggling.
[54:19.820 --> 54:20.280]  Okay, that's me.
[54:21.560 --> 54:24.260]  And I see a truck on its side in the mud behind me.
[54:24.260 --> 54:24.440]  Okay.
[54:25.600 --> 54:26.600]  Oh, no, I'm gonna roll.
[54:26.840 --> 54:27.200]  No, stop.
[54:27.200 --> 54:27.680]  You're good.
[54:27.980 --> 54:28.320]  You're good.
[54:28.500 --> 54:29.960]  You see things as they should be.
[54:34.220 --> 54:35.740]  No, what is wrong with the wheels?
[54:36.120 --> 54:37.580]  If I turn it, just...
[54:37.580 --> 54:38.540]  You're fine.
[54:41.820 --> 54:42.740]  You're doing great.
[54:44.900 --> 54:46.080]  It's a different kind of vehicle.
[54:47.520 --> 54:48.960]  Can you ram me?
[54:51.820 --> 54:52.220]  One sec.
[54:54.080 --> 54:54.920]  Andrew's eating a mint.
[54:55.180 --> 54:55.840]  It's going for a mint.
[54:56.020 --> 54:56.380]  Damn it.
[54:56.500 --> 54:57.060]  Mouthful of mint.
[54:57.200 --> 54:58.120]  Going for a full mint.
[54:58.140 --> 54:58.340]  Are you stuck?
[54:59.220 --> 54:59.880]  Oh, big time.
[55:00.400 --> 55:01.400]  Okay, let me see if I can push you.
[55:05.420 --> 55:06.200]  Oh, thank you.
[55:06.260 --> 55:07.320]  There you go, Nick.
[55:07.760 --> 55:08.540]  Oh, thank you.
[55:08.800 --> 55:09.300]  Looks like it's open.
[55:09.700 --> 55:09.960]  All right.
[55:10.080 --> 55:10.440]  Why?
[55:10.660 --> 55:12.380]  I think I've turned my handbrake on by accident.
[55:12.420 --> 55:13.020]  Thanks such...
[55:13.020 --> 55:13.340]  Oh!
[55:16.940 --> 55:18.140]  Nick had a moment of clarity.
[55:18.500 --> 55:20.080]  That's on me.
[55:21.360 --> 55:21.760]  Handbrake.
[55:22.260 --> 55:23.840]  All right, let's get to this freaking...
[55:23.840 --> 55:24.580]  All-wheel drive.
[55:25.180 --> 55:25.720]  Oh, yeah.
[55:26.080 --> 55:26.860]  You don't want to have that on you.
[55:27.200 --> 55:28.440]  All-wheel drive is the best.
[55:29.280 --> 55:29.580]  Yeah, that'll...
[55:30.880 --> 55:33.000]  Maybe we should all play Death Stranding.
[55:35.280 --> 55:36.180]  Is it multiplayer?
[55:36.360 --> 55:36.780]  Can we?
[55:37.460 --> 55:39.340]  Nah, but it's like this with legs though, isn't it?
[55:39.720 --> 55:40.100]  Yes.
[55:43.660 --> 55:45.320]  I could not figure that game out.
[55:45.360 --> 55:47.060]  I don't know what that game wanted me to feel.
[55:49.060 --> 55:49.860]  Confused, I think.
[55:50.340 --> 55:50.980]  I agree.
[55:52.260 --> 55:53.520]  Not my speed.
[55:54.440 --> 55:57.240]  I didn't play long enough for the game to get out of its own arsehole.
[55:59.880 --> 56:00.800]  I don't know that it does.
[56:01.120 --> 56:02.200]  Delivering Troy Baker a pizza.
[56:02.480 --> 56:03.000]  That was fun.
[56:05.640 --> 56:06.780]  Oh, you're living the dream.
[56:10.420 --> 56:11.340]  I got you, buddy.
[56:12.240 --> 56:12.680]  Thanks.
[56:13.660 --> 56:14.900]  I'm not gonna let you get stuck.
[56:15.520 --> 56:18.000]  It is insane the difference in size in these two vehicles.
[56:19.740 --> 56:23.500]  Having seen an H2 and, you know, been in the army and been around Humvees.
[56:23.920 --> 56:27.700]  H2 is smaller than a Humvee, but still, this thing is like seven of those.
[56:29.400 --> 56:31.060]  Is a Humvee different to a Hummer?
[56:32.260 --> 56:39.100]  Yeah, I think a Hummer is like the company, right?
[56:40.280 --> 56:42.800]  Hummer, and they make the H1, the H2 and the H3.
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.080]  And then a Humvee is just HMMWV, which is the high mobility multi-wheeled vehicle
[56:48.080 --> 56:51.720]  that the military buys, which is their just stripped down military version.
[56:52.440 --> 56:53.640]  Oh, good Lord.
[56:54.980 --> 56:56.240]  That's what I'm thinking, Nick.
[56:56.720 --> 56:58.000]  I don't know if I can make it.
[56:58.820 --> 57:00.120]  Just bypass that mud.
[57:01.300 --> 57:02.340]  Is this a road?
[57:03.160 --> 57:04.160]  Oh, yeah.
[57:05.740 --> 57:07.860]  That's a big boy move.
[57:07.860 --> 57:10.080]  Big boys make it up big hills.
[57:10.180 --> 57:13.540]  Big boys do tough big boy work in big trucks.
[57:13.920 --> 57:15.400]  I'm a big boy.
[57:16.520 --> 57:17.340]  What's going on?
[57:17.440 --> 57:18.280]  And that'll do it.
[57:20.500 --> 57:22.160]  Very happy I navigated that.
[57:22.420 --> 57:23.120]  Oh, you said happy.
[57:24.980 --> 57:26.200]  Oh, no, I said the H word.
[57:29.820 --> 57:30.540]  Oh, yeah.
[57:31.640 --> 57:32.520]  What's everybody working on?
[57:32.560 --> 57:33.600]  We're trying to get to...
[57:33.600 --> 57:34.080]  I don't know.
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.200]  I was about to say, are we all trying to get to this watchtower?
[57:36.220 --> 57:36.580]  I think so.
[57:36.580 --> 57:38.300]  There's a castle out in the distance.
[57:38.440 --> 57:39.000]  That's pretty cool.
[57:40.400 --> 57:42.740]  I think I just found Gavin hanging out.
[57:43.760 --> 57:45.320]  Come on, get out of the puddle, you.
[57:48.260 --> 57:49.940]  Has the... you get the all-wheel drive on?
[57:50.600 --> 57:50.800]  Yep.
[57:51.360 --> 57:51.820]  Good deal.
[57:51.920 --> 57:53.620]  Oh, back into the puddle again.
[57:54.060 --> 57:57.040]  I'll take a left here to head towards the watchtower.
[57:58.240 --> 58:00.140]  Mate, what if we all arrive at the same time?
[58:00.480 --> 58:00.960]  We won't.
[58:05.140 --> 58:06.380]  All arrive at the watchtower.
[58:07.300 --> 58:07.700]  Ah.
[58:10.800 --> 58:12.120]  Ow, ow, ow.
[58:12.980 --> 58:13.780]  Bunch of rock.
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.600]  Excuse me, why don't you just latch on?
[58:16.080 --> 58:16.300]  I'll pull you.
[58:16.300 --> 58:17.880]  Twatted me, you son of a gun.
[58:18.580 --> 58:19.480]  That's what I'm here for.
[58:21.800 --> 58:23.920]  Am I going to go straight here or right?
[58:24.020 --> 58:24.820]  I hope I don't go right.
[58:25.120 --> 58:25.500]  Let me see.
[58:25.640 --> 58:26.300]  We'll stop for a second.
[58:27.840 --> 58:28.240]  Straight.
[58:28.440 --> 58:28.860]  I told you.
[58:29.880 --> 58:30.440]  Oh, this is...
[58:31.160 --> 58:32.980]  I am deep in gooey mud.
[58:33.680 --> 58:34.480]  Stop, Andrew.
[58:34.480 --> 58:37.380]  Andrew, help me.
[58:38.080 --> 58:41.120]  I thought I was in your way and whatnot.
[58:45.660 --> 58:47.340]  He's been sitting on that, dude.
[58:47.880 --> 58:48.300]  Excuse me.
[58:48.680 --> 58:49.660]  Oh, shit, the tree went.
[58:51.300 --> 58:52.180]  Are you trying to get ahead of me?
[58:53.000 --> 58:53.580]  It's a race.
[58:55.000 --> 58:55.500]  It's a race.
[58:58.860 --> 59:01.200]  You were where you were supposed to be, Andrew.
[59:02.300 --> 59:02.720]  Thank you.
[59:02.720 --> 59:05.240]  I'm trying to pass them.
[59:06.380 --> 59:07.220]  I'm going to catch them.
[59:07.340 --> 59:10.280]  Do it for this piece of shit.
[59:12.020 --> 59:12.820]  What did that say?
[59:13.140 --> 59:13.560]  Ortris?
[59:14.960 --> 59:16.240]  It's okay, I got it.
[59:16.320 --> 59:16.670]  I got it.
[59:17.380 --> 59:17.800]  You sure?
[59:17.920 --> 59:20.140]  Yeah, I'll winch my way to freedom.
[59:24.160 --> 59:24.780]  There we go.
[59:24.860 --> 59:25.840]  Oh, I see the watchtower.
[59:27.360 --> 59:28.100]  Oh, shit.
[59:28.540 --> 59:30.360]  Oh my God, there's a fucking...
[59:30.360 --> 59:32.540]  Oh, Gavin, come back.
[59:32.600 --> 59:33.440]  Did you see this?
[59:33.660 --> 59:34.480]  Gavin, come back.
[59:34.480 --> 59:36.220]  There's a floppy knight.
[59:37.580 --> 59:40.840]  Like in a car dealership that blows in the wind.
[59:43.440 --> 59:44.180]  I'll have to see.
[59:44.300 --> 59:45.280]  I'll have to come back for that.
[59:47.420 --> 59:48.880]  I'm at the watchtower bottom.
[59:49.340 --> 59:50.920]  That is so cool.
[59:52.620 --> 59:53.940]  Andrew, you can stick it on your car.
[59:54.580 --> 59:55.240]  Yeah, I'm on my way.
[59:57.900 --> 59:58.780]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.380]  Andrew, check this out.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.140]  Oh, the floppy knight.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:04.740]  Isn't that awesome?
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.800]  He's going...
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.580]  Can you hit the floppy knight with your car?
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.240]  I'm trying to hit him with my...
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.180]  Nah.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:14.780]  Maybe it's a smaller car.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.560]  Get winched to him.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.260]  Hey, Gavin, did you get the watchtower?
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.280]  Yeah.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:20.780]  Congratulations, buddy.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.380]  Is that all the watchtowers or were there any more?
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:23.740]  Yeah.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.900]  I think you guys did it.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.360]  I'm coming for him.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.220]  I'm coming for him.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.300]  All right, next time we can complete some missions, maybe.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.040]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.280]  Yeah, I want to get a car that's out there.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.060]  We go get a car.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.680]  You guys desperately need new cars.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.100]  The cars that we can get from this map will be good cars for this map.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.260]  I appreciate the use of your Hummer, Geoff.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.020]  You can use my ramp to attack this knight.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.620]  Ah, dude, I don't think I can...
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.980]  All right, you're going to need...
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.460]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.620]  This is going to work.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:55.740]  All right.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.660]  I need you to back up.
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.420]  You're too high up.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.080]  There you go.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.040]  There you go.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:03.320]  Okay.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.100]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.060]  Uh...
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.980]  Let me see if I can winch to something.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:21.760]  Come on.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.900]  Oh, you're so close to getting over it.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:25.700]  Are you on the roof?
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.040]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.260]  Gavin, can you...
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.620]  We're trying to fuck up this knight.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:30.920]  Gavin, can you...
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.100]  You want to wedge up the ass?
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.760]  Can you get on top of me?
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.380]  Oh, no, Geoff is tipping.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.520]  I'm tipping, but I'm driving.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.840]  I've pushed Andrew forward.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.100]  I'm driving.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:39.700]  I'm driving.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.420]  Oh, wow.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.880]  Andrew, it looks like you're right on top of it to me.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.840]  Um, I'm right there, but we just need some height to hit this fucker.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.160]  He's protected by some crates.
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.100]  Oh, oh, you're bouncing me.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.700]  That kind of works.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.020]  Oh, I think this is...
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.600]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:09.400]  Wonders.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:10.700]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.460]  You got a pin.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.280]  Fuck you, knight.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.040]  Nice.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.500]  Nick, you got to get in on this action.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840]  I'm on my way.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.280]  No, he's not.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.300]  Yes, I am.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.440]  Oh, you...
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:21.560]  No, I'm not.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.540]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:23.740]  Okay, well, never mind.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:24.960]  I'll hit him with my wheel though.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:25.560]  He's on the side.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.960]  Did they do mocap for that?
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:38.040]  I would love to put mocap dots on an inflatable arm man and just apply it to different CG characters.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.260]  Oh, that'd be great.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.320]  That's a great idea.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.060]  Yep.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:41.640]  All right.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.660]  We're wrapping up trucks here.
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:50.800]  Make sure you check out our Patreon, the regulation pod, regulatrion.com.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.960]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.080]  We're going to do more missions soon.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.640]  I'm going to say this in the outro.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:58.760]  Make sure we all tail sync because there were a lot of technical difficulties in this one.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.740]  And if you ever wonder why we don't play more takes, it's not because we don't like it.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.400]  It's because this 40 minute video was two and a half hours of trying to record.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:08.600]  Yep.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.260]  Yep.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.900]  I'm almost on top of the night.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.380]  Oh, Gavin, you're...
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.120]  Tune in next time.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.000]  Oh, oh, I got him.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:15.660]  I got him.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.860]  I got that son of a bitch.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.280]  I took him out.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.600]  He's dead.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.240]  No, Geoff, you're saving him.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:21.500]  What?
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:21.900]  I can't.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:22.760]  It's not on my screen.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:23.900]  I can see it.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.040]  On my screen, you're saving him.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:25.860]  How's that saving him?
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.820]  You're pushing me off him.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.720]  Oh, we're not even touching on my screen, but I'll back up.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.140]  Oh, that's crazy.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:32.980]  See you next time.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:33.300]  Bye.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.600]  See you next time.
