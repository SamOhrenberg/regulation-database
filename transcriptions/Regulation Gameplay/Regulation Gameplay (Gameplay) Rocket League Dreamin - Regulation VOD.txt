[00:00.000 --> 00:02.060]  And we're live. Hello. Oh, my God.
[00:02.640 --> 00:04.320]  Welcome to Friday Streaming.
[00:04.580 --> 00:05.800]  Oh, chat here already.
[00:06.400 --> 00:09.020]  Wow. Get those corn cats.
[00:09.020 --> 00:10.940]  Get those in. I'll be dead now.
[00:12.660 --> 00:14.320]  Wee. Oh, you're dead mouse?
[00:14.640 --> 00:15.580]  Distracting? Yeah.
[00:16.660 --> 00:17.780]  I always eat dead mouse.
[00:18.340 --> 00:19.380]  I don't know. I don't know.
[00:19.460 --> 00:20.820]  He's Canadian, I think.
[00:20.900 --> 00:21.980]  That's all I know about him.
[00:22.300 --> 00:23.900]  He's a DJ. I didn't know that.
[00:24.560 --> 00:25.180]  Oh, look at that.
[00:25.340 --> 00:26.820]  What do you know about dead mouse?
[00:27.780 --> 00:28.620]  I he's a DJ.
[00:28.620 --> 00:31.640]  Nice. I did know that, unfortunately.
[00:32.560 --> 00:34.220]  How's everyone doing in the chat?
[00:35.240 --> 00:35.680]  Hey, everybody.
[00:38.480 --> 00:39.420]  Happy Friday.
[00:39.720 --> 00:40.380]  Happy Friday.
[00:40.480 --> 00:41.660]  We got a lot of corn cats.
[00:42.060 --> 00:43.280]  Got some happy people.
[00:44.160 --> 00:47.200]  It is just Nick and I today because people
[00:47.760 --> 00:52.840]  on vacations and stuff and visiting family and all that good stuff.
[00:53.960 --> 00:56.800]  Yeah, we time this out just right, too, because I'm on vacation
[00:56.800 --> 00:57.540]  starting on Monday.
[00:57.780 --> 01:02.280]  So, yeah, I think any other day you'd be on your own, which is.
[01:02.400 --> 01:04.740]  Yeah, I'm glad you're here.
[01:04.840 --> 01:06.260]  I think I might be.
[01:06.520 --> 01:08.560]  It might just be Eric and I next week.
[01:08.760 --> 01:11.220]  I'm not sure who is Gavin's out.
[01:11.340 --> 01:12.100]  It's a whole thing.
[01:12.440 --> 01:16.000]  Anyway. Yeah, we're here to play some Rocket League,
[01:16.280 --> 01:20.260]  some ranked as long as we accepted our terms and conditions.
[01:20.780 --> 01:23.820]  I believe I have just.
[01:24.440 --> 01:27.900]  Now, we tried to do this in a video that isn't out yet.
[01:28.520 --> 01:30.080]  And Geoff was too low level.
[01:30.360 --> 01:31.400]  So we were unable to.
[01:32.000 --> 01:32.620]  We just played.
[01:33.060 --> 01:37.420]  Geoff had a few nights, not just he was not just limited to to one.
[01:37.860 --> 01:39.900]  I'm back. Are you back? Yeah, I'm back.
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.080]  I don't know why, but discord is freezing on me.
[01:42.140 --> 01:43.220]  My computer is terrible.
[01:44.380 --> 01:46.140]  It's time. It's time travel for you.
[01:46.280 --> 01:48.060]  It is. OK, I'm going to be in the back.
[01:48.100 --> 01:51.580]  Nick, you push. OK, I'll be D, at least on the start.
[01:52.220 --> 01:53.080]  Here we go.
[01:53.940 --> 01:56.700]  OK, hold back. Whoa. Yeah.
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.120]  Nice push. Thank you.
[02:01.920 --> 02:02.760]  Oh, too much.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.180]  I'm going to be a little bit push out a little.
[02:05.380 --> 02:08.580]  I have a pro controller.
[02:08.940 --> 02:11.460]  I'm still getting used to using it.
[02:11.540 --> 02:12.660]  And I have fuck.
[02:12.720 --> 02:15.860]  Oh, turn the sensitivity up on my right trigger.
[02:16.020 --> 02:17.020]  And it is bothering me.
[02:17.860 --> 02:19.240]  Oh, yeah. You got to adjust that.
[02:20.020 --> 02:21.240]  Oh, there goes Andrew.
[02:21.400 --> 02:22.800]  Can you adjust sensitivity on a trigger?
[02:22.960 --> 02:24.060]  I think. Well, maybe not.
[02:24.800 --> 02:25.920]  There we go.
[02:28.860 --> 02:30.320]  OK, fuck, there he is.
[02:30.640 --> 02:31.520]  Yeah, I'm clearing it.
[02:32.340 --> 02:33.700]  What is this? The only time?
[02:33.740 --> 02:35.500]  No. OK, we got to go back.
[02:35.760 --> 02:37.260]  The only time I've ever used it.
[02:37.340 --> 02:38.240]  It's only two of us.
[02:39.020 --> 02:40.380]  Why does the world work this way?
[02:42.820 --> 02:43.620]  Oh, OK.
[02:43.900 --> 02:44.300]  You know what?
[02:44.360 --> 02:47.660]  You can abandon your recording if if that that might be.
[02:47.660 --> 02:49.680]  It's my recording that's causing it.
[02:49.820 --> 02:51.500]  But if it happens again, I will.
[02:51.800 --> 02:52.960]  Just to see if that helps.
[02:53.220 --> 02:54.320]  Oh, that might go in.
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.200]  Oh, drop, drop, drop, drop.
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.700]  It's in the goal!
[03:00.680 --> 03:02.460]  Running around my room right now.
[03:03.500 --> 03:04.800]  Doing the soccer slide.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.480]  They have great goal celebrations in soccer.
[03:08.960 --> 03:09.340]  Oh, really?
[03:09.600 --> 03:10.420]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[03:10.520 --> 03:11.500]  I'd say number one.
[03:11.600 --> 03:12.260]  Hell yeah, they do.
[03:12.740 --> 03:13.720]  OK, I'm going to go up.
[03:13.900 --> 03:14.400]  I'm going to push.
[03:14.780 --> 03:16.120]  All right, I'm back.
[03:16.920 --> 03:17.980]  That went nowhere.
[03:18.180 --> 03:19.360]  That moved a whole inch.
[03:19.580 --> 03:22.200]  That was not a thrilling tip off.
[03:22.540 --> 03:23.880]  Oh, oh, I'm dribbling.
[03:24.280 --> 03:24.860]  I'm dribbling.
[03:25.120 --> 03:25.980]  I'm dribbling.
[03:26.580 --> 03:28.820]  Oh, you said it perfectly and I blew it.
[03:28.840 --> 03:29.800]  No, I think that was on me.
[03:29.880 --> 03:30.580]  I was blocking you, man.
[03:30.860 --> 03:31.400]  That was on me.
[03:31.940 --> 03:32.840]  That was a great try.
[03:33.720 --> 03:35.120]  Oh, oh, I missed.
[03:35.960 --> 03:36.800]  OK, got it.
[03:36.880 --> 03:37.700]  Nice. OK.
[03:38.600 --> 03:39.220]  All right, I'll stay back.
[03:39.600 --> 03:40.320]  I was kind of in no man's land.
[03:41.080 --> 03:42.980]  Oh, they shot it real.
[03:43.200 --> 03:43.920]  Yeah, that was good.
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.820]  Oh, he tricked me.
[03:46.540 --> 03:47.500]  He tricked me.
[03:47.960 --> 03:48.400]  Fuck.
[03:48.700 --> 03:50.120]  He tricked me real good.
[03:51.960 --> 03:53.060]  Uh, sorry, y'all.
[03:53.100 --> 03:54.440]  I'm just looking over at the chat now.
[03:55.220 --> 03:56.340]  How does everything sound?
[03:56.380 --> 03:56.800]  Everything OK?
[03:57.040 --> 03:58.280]  I up my volume a little bit.
[03:58.340 --> 03:59.260]  I think Andrew's good.
[03:59.600 --> 04:00.420]  Let me know about the game.
[04:01.620 --> 04:03.460]  Keep us updated on audio.
[04:05.180 --> 04:06.580]  Yeah, as we know.
[04:06.780 --> 04:07.560]  As I love.
[04:08.340 --> 04:10.700]  As I love doing when it was me running the stream.
[04:10.700 --> 04:11.480]  Oh, boy.
[04:11.720 --> 04:12.780]  There's audio updates.
[04:15.000 --> 04:15.840]  Was unfortunate.
[04:16.100 --> 04:17.680]  I gave you a checklist for audio.
[04:17.880 --> 04:22.860]  I wasn't I forgot about the basics of setting up like scenes and stuff.
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.500]  Yeah, well, the even the checklist, I think.
[04:26.760 --> 04:27.520]  I don't know.
[04:27.920 --> 04:29.440]  Like you did a great job with the checklist.
[04:29.680 --> 04:34.080]  I just there are things that I'm missing that I don't understand how to add.
[04:35.020 --> 04:35.680]  That's OK.
[04:36.500 --> 04:37.380]  Oh, shit.
[04:37.540 --> 04:39.060]  OK, I'm going back, going back, going back, going back.
[04:40.360 --> 04:41.880]  Oh, swinging around.
[04:44.160 --> 04:46.120]  Nick's a little quiet, but the game seems fine.
[04:46.260 --> 04:48.260]  OK, oh, come on, come on.
[04:49.300 --> 04:51.180]  Oh, it's them feel.
[04:51.220 --> 04:53.440]  I turn myself up a little bit more.
[04:53.600 --> 04:54.220]  Let's see.
[04:57.620 --> 04:59.120]  Booster, boost and shit.
[04:59.260 --> 04:59.940]  Geoff is quiet.
[05:00.040 --> 05:00.420]  They block.
[05:00.580 --> 05:01.840]  Yeah, Geoff and Eric are quiet.
[05:02.660 --> 05:04.120]  Yeah, it's like Gavin is here.
[05:04.860 --> 05:06.440]  Yeah, he must be mad.
[05:07.420 --> 05:08.260]  Nice save.
[05:08.260 --> 05:09.000]  Thank you.
[05:09.420 --> 05:10.980]  I missed it.
[05:11.580 --> 05:12.740]  That's the first game.
[05:13.860 --> 05:14.760]  Yeah, we're warming up.
[05:15.080 --> 05:15.600]  Exactly.
[05:16.140 --> 05:17.420]  Get out of here, ball.
[05:18.780 --> 05:20.060]  We're warming up.
[05:21.700 --> 05:22.480]  Cross, cross.
[05:22.600 --> 05:23.040]  Oh, shit.
[05:23.040 --> 05:23.680]  You got me.
[05:23.760 --> 05:24.500]  You got me.
[05:25.120 --> 05:26.240]  Yeah, nice.
[05:26.900 --> 05:28.100]  Did that bounce off of you?
[05:28.220 --> 05:29.920]  I don't think so, but maybe.
[05:30.260 --> 05:30.460]  OK.
[05:31.240 --> 05:32.120]  Oh, shit.
[05:32.220 --> 05:32.500]  OK.
[05:33.160 --> 05:35.460]  Oh, that's oh, I was tempted.
[05:36.520 --> 05:37.620]  Oh, I just missed.
[05:40.420 --> 05:47.040]  I'll tell you what, it's easy or like when you're when you're talking, your brain suddenly stops doing.
[05:47.500 --> 05:47.640]  Fuck.
[05:48.980 --> 05:50.960]  That was on me, they just went right past me.
[05:51.280 --> 05:52.260]  Nah, nah.
[05:52.920 --> 05:53.740]  They juked you, it's OK.
[05:57.520 --> 06:00.860]  What's uh, I was trying to think about what we have coming out.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.200]  Did we finalize that poll that we had on the Falcons here?
[06:05.200 --> 06:05.760]  The fast traffic, right?
[06:05.980 --> 06:08.000]  The second fast traffic that you did?
[06:09.280 --> 06:10.680]  Yeah, I did it.
[06:10.900 --> 06:11.580]  I edited it.
[06:12.080 --> 06:14.700]  It's a Nick production.
[06:14.900 --> 06:16.680]  It is a full on Nick production.
[06:17.540 --> 06:18.460]  Did you watch it?
[06:18.780 --> 06:20.040]  I haven't seen it yet, no.
[06:21.460 --> 06:22.560]  I lived it.
[06:22.680 --> 06:23.280]  It's ridiculous.
[06:23.680 --> 06:23.880]  Yeah.
[06:24.300 --> 06:25.140]  Oh, I did too.
[06:25.140 --> 06:26.680]  Let me tell you.
[06:28.120 --> 06:28.640]  Um.
[06:29.880 --> 06:31.600]  We're getting uh.
[06:32.300 --> 06:32.680]  The.
[06:33.060 --> 06:35.360]  One of the heists edited currently at the moment.
[06:36.380 --> 06:37.000]  And it was a lot of.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.020]  The person was like, you should have a cut.
[06:39.380 --> 06:40.580]  By like.
[06:40.900 --> 06:42.160]  Next week essentially.
[06:42.680 --> 06:43.520]  It's a long one.
[06:44.360 --> 06:46.840]  And I was very excited to say like.
[06:46.920 --> 06:47.640]  Oh, that might be.
[06:48.200 --> 06:52.720]  There's a heist coming up where Nick makes a choice that literally doubled the record time.
[06:52.720 --> 06:54.560]  No, well.
[06:54.640 --> 06:56.100]  I'm hoping it's that one.
[06:57.020 --> 06:58.700]  It has to be that one.
[06:58.980 --> 07:00.100]  Which is in what part?
[07:00.420 --> 07:01.540]  Ah, damn it.
[07:01.700 --> 07:03.760]  So that's part two.
[07:05.140 --> 07:05.700]  Uh.
[07:05.940 --> 07:07.280]  Part one comes out.
[07:07.340 --> 07:09.180]  If you're watching this on live.
[07:09.540 --> 07:12.100]  Part one comes out tomorrow on the YouTube channel.
[07:12.700 --> 07:13.880]  And the Patreon.
[07:14.320 --> 07:16.840]  If you are watching this after the fact.
[07:16.880 --> 07:17.580]  That's out now.
[07:18.720 --> 07:19.680]  Go watch that.
[07:19.680 --> 07:21.060]  Then come back and tell us what you think.
[07:21.600 --> 07:22.000]  Yes.
[07:23.080 --> 07:24.200]  And get ready for a lot more.
[07:25.140 --> 07:25.540]  Yeah.
[07:26.680 --> 07:27.500]  When we're able to.
[07:27.600 --> 07:28.420]  You know, we've only done.
[07:28.540 --> 07:29.800]  We've recorded four of those, right?
[07:30.180 --> 07:34.560]  And yet, I feel the itch for that game now more than I think I ever have.
[07:35.780 --> 07:36.460]  Yeah, we gotta.
[07:37.280 --> 07:38.200]  Get back into it.
[07:40.300 --> 07:42.160]  Once we get through next week.
[07:42.200 --> 07:43.340]  And everyone's kind of back.
[07:44.780 --> 07:46.060]  Finish up some of those heists.
[07:46.060 --> 07:50.360]  I think Eric and I are just going to play a lot of Ratatouille next week.
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.540]  Because it's going to be him and I.
[07:52.060 --> 07:52.720]  The start of the week.
[07:54.080 --> 07:56.400]  Do you know how many of those you've done now?
[07:56.820 --> 07:58.020]  I think we've made six.
[07:58.660 --> 08:00.100]  I think we've released like three.
[08:01.660 --> 08:03.460]  I think we've done two.
[08:03.700 --> 08:03.980]  Two?
[08:04.080 --> 08:04.600]  That are out.
[08:04.960 --> 08:05.380]  Fuck.
[08:05.640 --> 08:07.380]  I think.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.560]  Full transparency for the audience.
[08:10.760 --> 08:14.600]  The second and third episode are presented in a four by three ratio.
[08:14.680 --> 08:15.120]  Yes.
[08:17.520 --> 08:19.800]  I don't know what happened to your capture.
[08:20.300 --> 08:21.060]  No, yeah.
[08:21.100 --> 08:21.860]  I don't know if I.
[08:22.120 --> 08:22.820]  Something happened.
[08:23.100 --> 08:24.560]  I probably hit a button by accident.
[08:24.900 --> 08:25.360]  But yeah.
[08:25.520 --> 08:26.140]  It's all good.
[08:26.520 --> 08:27.600]  But we caught it.
[08:27.680 --> 08:30.580]  And we fixed it for four and on.
[08:32.060 --> 08:34.200]  You even bring in some special guests later in the series.
[08:34.360 --> 08:34.780]  That's true.
[08:36.480 --> 08:38.440]  We get the rat from Flushed Away.
[08:38.940 --> 08:39.800]  It's a really big deal.
[08:41.200 --> 08:42.040]  It was.
[08:42.040 --> 08:44.340]  I had to go deep in my personal funds.
[08:44.480 --> 08:45.220]  To make it happen.
[08:47.600 --> 08:48.720]  Ratatouille shows up.
[08:49.500 --> 08:50.400]  With his brethren.
[08:51.660 --> 08:52.900]  Let's bounce back on this one.
[08:53.600 --> 08:55.180]  We need to win ten games to get ranked.
[08:56.180 --> 08:56.620]  Yes.
[08:56.800 --> 08:58.400]  I think I am ranked somehow.
[08:58.660 --> 09:00.240]  My brother and I play this sometimes.
[09:00.680 --> 09:01.480]  But that being said.
[09:01.560 --> 09:02.840]  We need to get you a good ranking.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.340]  Oh shit.
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.500]  They screwed that up.
[09:07.640 --> 09:08.560]  We're real lucky.
[09:12.480 --> 09:13.280]  Nice cross.
[09:13.880 --> 09:15.340]  We're blue this time by the way.
[09:15.460 --> 09:17.260]  I thought we were orange.
[09:17.640 --> 09:18.120]  At first.
[09:18.900 --> 09:19.840]  I was like wait.
[09:22.740 --> 09:24.820]  I was like they missed real good.
[09:24.920 --> 09:25.960]  Trying to get in our net.
[09:26.160 --> 09:27.440]  It was just you playing defense.
[09:27.640 --> 09:28.360]  You did a great job.
[09:28.700 --> 09:30.120]  I'm going to try to smash this thing.
[09:31.560 --> 09:32.000]  Oh fuck.
[09:33.280 --> 09:34.200]  See if you can set me.
[09:34.600 --> 09:35.320]  Give it a little tap.
[09:35.700 --> 09:36.100]  Alright.
[09:37.900 --> 09:38.540]  Alright.
[09:39.120 --> 09:40.520]  I did not tap it.
[09:40.660 --> 09:42.120]  Oh I missed it.
[09:42.260 --> 09:42.780]  Going back.
[09:44.800 --> 09:45.440]  Okay.
[09:45.600 --> 09:46.300]  Stop that there.
[09:47.720 --> 09:50.460]  I'll hold back for a second here.
[09:50.760 --> 09:51.460]  Got it.
[09:51.800 --> 09:52.680]  Very nice.
[09:53.920 --> 09:54.980]  This is teamwork right here.
[09:55.500 --> 09:57.300]  It is.
[09:58.580 --> 09:59.860]  Fuel up.
[10:00.280 --> 10:00.860]  That's wide.
[10:01.360 --> 10:03.660]  Good job Nick.
[10:03.660 --> 10:04.360]  Oh.
[10:06.080 --> 10:07.480]  Didn't expect him to touch it.
[10:09.400 --> 10:11.100]  It hit both posts.
[10:11.460 --> 10:12.720]  Nick get the rebound.
[10:13.240 --> 10:15.580]  What a goal.
[10:17.400 --> 10:18.760]  It was bouncing all over the place.
[10:19.860 --> 10:20.320]  Look at this.
[10:21.340 --> 10:22.960]  What a recovery.
[10:23.940 --> 10:24.680]  Fuck yeah.
[10:24.960 --> 10:25.620]  We're in the lead.
[10:26.280 --> 10:29.860]  Let's get Andrew the best ranking we can get.
[10:30.780 --> 10:32.840]  Put some piss rats in chat for Andrew here.
[10:32.840 --> 10:33.540]  Oh shit.
[10:33.760 --> 10:34.040]  Okay.
[10:36.520 --> 10:37.080]  Crossing.
[10:39.700 --> 10:41.720]  That was a hell of a shot.
[10:42.340 --> 10:44.020]  Even though it didn't go in, that was awesome.
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.640]  It felt so good.
[10:46.520 --> 10:47.640]  I'm sorry.
[10:48.120 --> 10:48.920]  You're fine.
[10:50.620 --> 10:51.840]  Let's cross back.
[10:52.760 --> 10:53.700]  They're scrambled.
[10:53.840 --> 10:54.860]  You can tell they're a little nervous.
[10:55.420 --> 10:56.520]  Oh fuck.
[10:57.400 --> 10:58.300]  I had to say something.
[11:00.100 --> 11:00.740]  Oh.
[11:01.060 --> 11:01.700]  Okay.
[11:02.640 --> 11:03.040]  Here we go.
[11:03.240 --> 11:05.040]  Oh no.
[11:05.420 --> 11:06.200]  I'm so scared.
[11:08.260 --> 11:09.400]  Nice Nick.
[11:10.760 --> 11:11.940]  That was great.
[11:12.980 --> 11:13.160]  Okay.
[11:15.060 --> 11:15.700]  Bam.
[11:16.100 --> 11:17.260]  Oh that's nice.
[11:18.680 --> 11:19.380]  Oh it's coming back.
[11:20.060 --> 11:21.660]  We had a little bit of a volley situation.
[11:21.680 --> 11:22.340]  That's to you.
[11:23.480 --> 11:24.300]  Got it.
[11:25.320 --> 11:27.460]  Watched a lot of soccer during the Olympics.
[11:27.700 --> 11:28.960]  So know some moves.
[11:29.080 --> 11:29.860]  That's not one.
[11:30.080 --> 11:31.240]  Still not one.
[11:31.580 --> 11:32.840]  What country was that?
[11:33.580 --> 11:36.460]  Who lost early?
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.680]  I don't know.
[11:37.740 --> 11:39.440]  I didn't really watch a lot of the soccer.
[11:41.560 --> 11:41.700]  Well.
[11:43.600 --> 11:44.520]  Here we go.
[11:45.100 --> 11:45.960]  Oh balls.
[11:46.980 --> 11:48.160]  Oh balls.
[11:50.580 --> 11:51.500]  Oh fuck.
[11:51.780 --> 11:52.000]  Okay.
[11:52.540 --> 11:53.360]  Two and a half minutes.
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.580]  Essentially we could have started now and just had a two and a half minute game.
[11:58.220 --> 11:59.560]  As opposed to a five minute.
[11:59.700 --> 12:01.760]  We're back at essentially nobody having goals.
[12:01.980 --> 12:03.080]  Us both being tied.
[12:03.880 --> 12:04.080]  Yeah.
[12:05.540 --> 12:06.180]  There you go.
[12:11.060 --> 12:11.280]  Oh.
[12:13.200 --> 12:14.080]  Oh Nick.
[12:14.960 --> 12:15.740]  There we go.
[12:15.740 --> 12:16.300]  What a shot.
[12:19.140 --> 12:20.260]  Watched a lot of handball.
[12:20.260 --> 12:20.900]  Love handball.
[12:21.300 --> 12:22.000]  Handball's great.
[12:23.740 --> 12:25.500]  I'm so glad they added that as an event.
[12:25.860 --> 12:26.860]  That wasn't there before, right?
[12:26.900 --> 12:27.620]  I'm just making sure.
[12:27.860 --> 12:28.620]  I have no idea.
[12:29.240 --> 12:32.080]  The way you said that was an authority so I agreed with you.
[12:32.220 --> 12:34.140]  But I have no clue when they added handball.
[12:35.480 --> 12:38.120]  I know they're getting rid of breaking for the next one.
[12:38.280 --> 12:39.180]  Which is too bad.
[12:41.060 --> 12:43.720]  The men's final for the breaking was incredible.
[12:45.160 --> 12:46.920]  I didn't watch much of the breaking.
[12:46.920 --> 12:49.740]  And I think they're adding cricket to the next Olympics.
[12:50.500 --> 12:51.660]  Now that's kind of fun.
[12:51.780 --> 12:52.760]  We're experts at it.
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.240]  Excited about that.
[12:55.580 --> 12:56.260]  Oh no.
[12:56.840 --> 12:58.560]  That's on me. I take full responsibility.
[12:59.280 --> 13:01.320]  Will the US field a team?
[13:01.580 --> 13:02.580]  Do we even play cricket here?
[13:02.840 --> 13:04.860]  I feel like the US will field...
[13:04.860 --> 13:06.140]  Yeah, I think so.
[13:06.900 --> 13:09.260]  I assume the US is involved in every sport.
[13:10.180 --> 13:10.980]  For the most part.
[13:11.660 --> 13:13.860]  I wonder how many they don't participate in.
[13:14.040 --> 13:15.500]  For the Summer Olympics.
[13:19.300 --> 13:20.340]  I don't...
[13:20.340 --> 13:21.300]  Probably nothing, right?
[13:21.420 --> 13:23.840]  They just seem to find people sometimes.
[13:24.540 --> 13:25.160]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[13:27.480 --> 13:29.820]  I was up watching cycling
[13:29.820 --> 13:31.580]  at 3am on the final.
[13:31.980 --> 13:33.100]  Nice, Nick!
[13:33.580 --> 13:34.460]  Thank you!
[13:36.320 --> 13:38.020]  I was watching cycling
[13:38.020 --> 13:39.880]  hoping Britain would win.
[13:40.340 --> 13:42.360]  Because I needed it to win our Olympic pool.
[13:43.160 --> 13:43.800]  And they were not.
[13:43.860 --> 13:45.060]  It was not a fruitful watch.
[13:45.060 --> 13:47.480]  But you did...
[13:47.480 --> 13:49.160]  You were pretty successful, weren't you?
[13:49.320 --> 13:50.360]  Yeah, you tied for first.
[13:50.440 --> 13:51.000]  I mean, that's a win.
[13:52.700 --> 13:53.660]  It's something.
[13:55.540 --> 13:57.060]  I made the joke...
[13:57.800 --> 13:59.600]  You guys need to have penalty kicks now.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.880]  To determine exactly the winner.
[14:03.020 --> 14:04.660]  Because there are no ties in the Olympics.
[14:07.720 --> 14:08.680]  Outside of...
[14:08.680 --> 14:09.980]  I think there was a tie
[14:10.500 --> 14:12.360]  last Olympics that was really cool.
[14:12.360 --> 14:14.260]  It was unprecedented.
[14:14.740 --> 14:15.260]  And they were like,
[14:15.340 --> 14:17.800]  you can either do a final round or...
[14:18.310 --> 14:19.660]  Nick, you're killing it, man!
[14:20.300 --> 14:21.600]  I'm feeling it!
[14:22.320 --> 14:24.140]  I want you to have your platinum.
[14:26.080 --> 14:26.920]  I'd love platinum.
[14:28.780 --> 14:29.580]  You don't.
[14:29.680 --> 14:30.660]  Because once you get platinum,
[14:30.820 --> 14:32.320]  then you face people who are no fun at all.
[14:33.660 --> 14:36.040]  Let's get as close to that without going over.
[14:38.180 --> 14:40.820]  And they've redone the rankings in this game a lot.
[14:40.820 --> 14:42.180]  I don't even know what they are,
[14:42.320 --> 14:43.700]  how they work anymore.
[14:44.700 --> 14:46.820]  It's funny, no matter how well you do,
[14:47.020 --> 14:48.840]  even if you've won all 10 of these games,
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.480]  if you've had a bad history,
[14:51.760 --> 14:53.100]  they still factor that
[14:53.100 --> 14:54.560]  into where you're ranked,
[14:54.680 --> 14:56.600]  even in the new seasons, which is really annoying.
[14:57.900 --> 14:59.100]  Uh-oh, that's bad.
[14:59.480 --> 15:00.500]  That's really not good.
[15:00.840 --> 15:02.420]  We got a lot of goals. We're fine.
[15:03.040 --> 15:03.960]  We can let one up.
[15:06.600 --> 15:07.820]  We got it. We're fine.
[15:07.820 --> 15:09.240]  We got it. No problem.
[15:09.520 --> 15:10.140]  All good.
[15:10.940 --> 15:12.760]  Was this a free-to-play game?
[15:13.180 --> 15:14.940]  It wasn't free-to-play when it launched, right?
[15:15.080 --> 15:16.760]  No, I paid for this game.
[15:17.940 --> 15:20.020]  I bought this game full price.
[15:22.640 --> 15:24.260]  And I kind of liked it more then,
[15:24.380 --> 15:25.720]  honestly, but it's still fun.
[15:26.140 --> 15:28.180]  Yeah, a lot of the unlockables
[15:28.180 --> 15:29.900]  and stuff were more
[15:29.900 --> 15:30.760]  within-game, right?
[15:31.620 --> 15:34.020]  Yeah, it was a less...
[15:34.020 --> 15:35.920]  It was a more intuitive system
[15:35.920 --> 15:37.780]  of how to unlock that, or open
[15:37.780 --> 15:39.920]  the stuff that you won, or that you
[15:39.920 --> 15:42.360]  had picked up.
[15:42.880 --> 15:43.920]  As opposed to all
[15:43.920 --> 15:45.940]  these menus with all this additional stuff.
[15:47.360 --> 15:48.100]  I'm backing up.
[15:48.400 --> 15:48.880]  Backing up.
[15:49.540 --> 15:52.000]  Oh, it's wide. Nice hit, though.
[15:52.200 --> 15:52.920]  Thank you.
[15:54.080 --> 15:55.320]  Keep it on their side.
[15:55.780 --> 15:56.800]  Gotta keep it over here.
[15:57.760 --> 15:58.620]  No goals for them.
[15:59.880 --> 16:00.880]  Get out of here.
[16:02.340 --> 16:02.700]  Ah.
[16:06.480 --> 16:07.000]  Nine.
[16:07.800 --> 16:10.140]  No! Oh, nice save.
[16:10.280 --> 16:10.540]  It's okay.
[16:11.420 --> 16:12.500]  I won it.
[16:13.120 --> 16:14.220]  Get it, get it!
[16:15.720 --> 16:17.740]  Nice! With one second left.
[16:21.700 --> 16:23.600]  I can't wait to see the stats.
[16:23.760 --> 16:25.520]  You must have got a million points.
[16:26.780 --> 16:28.260]  At least four goals by you.
[16:29.440 --> 16:29.880]  Yeah, but
[16:29.880 --> 16:31.000]  goals aren't everything.
[16:31.920 --> 16:32.960]  I also get the
[16:34.240 --> 16:35.120]  car touch
[16:35.120 --> 16:37.080]  one a lot. I guess I crash in other
[16:37.080 --> 16:38.520]  cars all the time. Oh, nice.
[16:39.540 --> 16:41.120]  And I think some of them might be teammates.
[16:41.300 --> 16:42.600]  Based on our head-on collision.
[16:43.160 --> 16:45.240]  Ooh! Printin' that Disney money!
[16:46.400 --> 16:46.780]  Ooh!
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.280]  Okay, I'm level 36.
[16:50.660 --> 16:53.020]  You got all five! That's awesome, man.
[16:53.860 --> 16:55.100]  But I had nine shots on
[16:55.100 --> 16:56.640]  goal, Andrew. That's too many.
[16:57.140 --> 16:59.120]  The trade-off wasn't high enough.
[16:59.260 --> 17:00.580]  No, that's insane.
[17:00.580 --> 17:01.500]  That's ridiculous.
[17:02.720 --> 17:03.620]  Let's do it again.
[17:04.200 --> 17:05.000]  One in the bag.
[17:06.160 --> 17:08.360]  One win. Two games.
[17:08.520 --> 17:08.800]  One win.
[17:11.520 --> 17:12.520]  That's 50-50.
[17:12.560 --> 17:12.860]  500.
[17:14.580 --> 17:15.140]  It is.
[17:16.080 --> 17:16.980]  Just nine more.
[17:19.080 --> 17:19.980]  Oh, the aquadome?
[17:20.360 --> 17:21.080]  I'm all about aquadome.
[17:21.560 --> 17:22.860]  I love this spot.
[17:24.360 --> 17:25.240]  Is this smaller?
[17:27.440 --> 17:29.080]  I don't think so.
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.620]  There is one that is smaller.
[17:31.260 --> 17:32.480]  But it's not this one.
[17:34.760 --> 17:36.640]  Dude, we're approaching that time of the year
[17:36.640 --> 17:37.760]  that's my favorite.
[17:38.160 --> 17:40.020]  Right up against football.
[17:42.060 --> 17:43.220]  Summer's almost over.
[17:43.480 --> 17:45.000]  Well, the heat of the
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.040]  summer is gonna reduce
[17:47.040 --> 17:47.620]  a little bit.
[17:49.960 --> 17:50.280]  Yeah.
[17:50.640 --> 17:52.280]  I'm excited for the football season.
[17:53.040 --> 17:53.600]  Dude, me too.
[17:54.380 --> 17:56.200]  I'm doing all my fantasy football research.
[17:56.200 --> 17:58.380]  I think I'll try to set up a fantasy
[17:58.380 --> 17:59.680]  thing for the Falcons.
[18:01.440 --> 18:03.780]  And then do an Eliminator Pool as well
[18:03.780 --> 18:05.000]  as part of the Falcon event.
[18:05.380 --> 18:06.280]  I missed.
[18:07.280 --> 18:08.900]  That is gonna take a lot of work.
[18:10.540 --> 18:11.960]  Dude, I've never done an Eliminator Pool.
[18:12.120 --> 18:13.860]  So what's the concept of that?
[18:14.040 --> 18:16.280]  I think we will all share one team
[18:16.280 --> 18:17.780]  and we'll make a pick as a group.
[18:18.540 --> 18:19.880]  And you have to pick
[18:19.880 --> 18:22.120]  a team to win, and if your team wins
[18:22.120 --> 18:23.080]  you advance.
[18:23.080 --> 18:25.020]  But if the team you pick loses,
[18:25.220 --> 18:26.400]  you're eliminated from the pool.
[18:27.120 --> 18:29.120]  And you can only pick each team once.
[18:29.860 --> 18:31.220]  So theoretically, with every
[18:31.220 --> 18:33.000]  week you advance, you're running out of options
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.480]  as far as viable teams to pick.
[18:35.880 --> 18:36.500]  Got it.
[18:40.580 --> 18:41.140]  Push.
[18:44.820 --> 18:46.660]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[18:47.240 --> 18:48.020]  Thank you.
[18:48.720 --> 18:50.080]  That was real close.
[18:50.600 --> 18:51.720]  That was real close.
[18:53.860 --> 18:54.300]  Fuck.
[18:54.700 --> 18:55.740]  Okay, they got it. They got it.
[18:55.840 --> 18:56.460]  Bounce on their side.
[18:58.380 --> 18:59.680]  Let's see if I can...
[18:59.680 --> 19:00.100]  That's over.
[19:00.320 --> 19:02.720]  Good call out.
[19:03.520 --> 19:05.560]  That's also way over and to the side.
[19:06.100 --> 19:07.200]  That wasn't close, that one.
[19:07.940 --> 19:08.980]  Okay, they're bouncing.
[19:10.380 --> 19:11.740]  Yeah, let's see if that does anything.
[19:12.460 --> 19:12.960]  It's coming back.
[19:14.640 --> 19:15.720]  Oh, nice!
[19:16.160 --> 19:16.440]  Sorry!
[19:18.060 --> 19:19.360]  That was like a double hit.
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.080]  I think I technically blocked that,
[19:26.140 --> 19:27.120]  but that was incredibly lucky.
[19:27.860 --> 19:28.240]  Nick!
[19:30.020 --> 19:31.200]  Sprinting down the field!
[19:31.760 --> 19:32.440]  With the kick!
[19:33.760 --> 19:34.760]  That was amazing.
[19:35.760 --> 19:36.500]  Look at this.
[19:36.580 --> 19:38.060]  That was like the goalie following their own.
[19:39.940 --> 19:41.780]  Nice little tap, get it down the middle.
[19:42.780 --> 19:44.260]  I'm to the right if you want to hold mid.
[19:47.840 --> 19:48.280]  Um...
[19:48.280 --> 19:50.280]  They don't like the kickoff.
[19:50.660 --> 19:51.280]  I don't know, let's go.
[19:52.880 --> 19:53.320]  Nick!
[19:53.980 --> 19:54.880]  There we go!
[19:55.340 --> 19:57.100]  To be fair, one of the guys didn't move.
[19:57.500 --> 20:00.240]  That is true, but you're killing it today.
[20:01.680 --> 20:03.920]  The angles are talking to me today, I guess.
[20:05.800 --> 20:08.640]  It really makes me feel like...
[20:08.640 --> 20:11.420]  Have we always done it with you, Gavin, and I?
[20:11.480 --> 20:12.540]  Or you, Geoff, and I?
[20:13.080 --> 20:13.940]  Oh, yeah!
[20:13.940 --> 20:15.800]  There's always been the watchful eye
[20:15.800 --> 20:17.480]  of someone who could be judging.
[20:17.480 --> 20:20.900]  I think me plus whoever else is just a weight on you.
[20:21.180 --> 20:22.340]  Seeing you be free
[20:22.340 --> 20:23.980]  and just getting all these goals
[20:23.980 --> 20:24.740]  is awesome.
[20:25.880 --> 20:26.820]  Regulation freedom.
[20:27.180 --> 20:27.600]  Yes!
[20:28.600 --> 20:30.700]  Oh, nice!
[20:31.500 --> 20:32.940]  Thank you. Oh, good clear.
[20:33.960 --> 20:34.420]  Okay.
[20:35.620 --> 20:36.980]  Oh, volleying it.
[20:37.640 --> 20:39.180]  I don't even want to get in there.
[20:39.940 --> 20:41.580]  You were popping it up, and I was like,
[20:41.580 --> 20:44.000]  I kind of want to disrupt this combo that he's got going.
[20:44.060 --> 20:44.840]  You got that, I got that.
[20:45.660 --> 20:46.100]  Crossing.
[20:46.940 --> 20:49.300]  It felt very Street Fighter.
[20:49.660 --> 20:51.920]  It did, yeah. You're keeping them in the air.
[20:52.760 --> 20:54.060]  Nice hit down.
[20:54.520 --> 20:55.480]  Oh, I missed that, though.
[20:57.400 --> 20:59.220]  Oh, I got that.
[20:59.700 --> 20:59.880]  Nice!
[21:01.660 --> 21:02.560]  Oh, that...
[21:02.560 --> 21:06.280]  Oh, great shot!
[21:06.280 --> 21:06.620]  That's for you!
[21:10.240 --> 21:10.680]  Oh!
[21:10.680 --> 21:11.620]  Nice hit.
[21:11.760 --> 21:13.800]  That was not nearly as centered as I thought it was.
[21:14.180 --> 21:16.300]  Speeding across to the left while hitting it.
[21:16.380 --> 21:17.300]  I was like, that's perfect.
[21:17.860 --> 21:18.820]  Couldn't have been more off.
[21:19.940 --> 21:22.280]  I mean, the thing is, if you put it past them, though,
[21:22.360 --> 21:23.640]  it's like, there's a shot.
[21:24.080 --> 21:24.940]  There's a chance.
[21:26.100 --> 21:27.380]  Nice, nice, nice.
[21:29.180 --> 21:30.440]  Nice. Can it go?
[21:30.600 --> 21:30.980]  Don't block it!
[21:31.440 --> 21:31.840]  Nice!
[21:33.220 --> 21:36.100]  I'm just watching. I just get to spectate.
[21:38.460 --> 21:39.120]  You're giving
[21:39.120 --> 21:40.540]  platinum performances, Nick,
[21:40.580 --> 21:41.760]  and I'm gonna get bronze,
[21:41.800 --> 21:43.100]  because I'm just here.
[21:47.540 --> 21:48.500]  Alright, let's see.
[21:50.180 --> 21:50.320]  Oh!
[21:51.160 --> 21:51.600]  Yeah!
[21:53.220 --> 21:54.580]  I think one of them may have given up.
[21:55.580 --> 21:56.360]  I'm glad it's Friday.
[21:57.040 --> 21:57.480]  Yeah.
[22:00.700 --> 22:01.780]  End of the week.
[22:02.880 --> 22:03.780]  Look at you.
[22:03.780 --> 22:05.780]  I literally...
[22:05.780 --> 22:06.900]  I was just looking at chat.
[22:09.740 --> 22:11.000]  You tell me what they're saying.
[22:12.340 --> 22:13.620]  They're saying you're amazing.
[22:13.880 --> 22:15.700]  TGIF. Holy shit, Nick.
[22:17.060 --> 22:18.180]  They're loving you.
[22:18.420 --> 22:19.200]  Oh, wow.
[22:20.960 --> 22:21.880]  I did two
[22:21.880 --> 22:23.700]  first touches. That was great.
[22:24.120 --> 22:24.740]  Look at me.
[22:27.140 --> 22:27.700]  Zero
[22:28.400 --> 22:28.960]  goals.
[22:29.360 --> 22:31.280]  One assist. Zero saves.
[22:31.940 --> 22:32.860]  One shot.
[22:35.480 --> 22:36.860]  You got an assist.
[22:37.240 --> 22:38.560]  You're setting me up. That's the thing.
[22:38.740 --> 22:40.580]  As long as you set me, I can do it.
[22:41.480 --> 22:43.220]  Listen, I'll set you up for
[22:43.220 --> 22:44.780]  one of your nine goals each game.
[22:44.900 --> 22:45.760]  I can commit to that.
[22:46.260 --> 22:47.660]  That's all you need from me.
[22:48.680 --> 22:50.400]  Here's the thing. Sometimes,
[22:51.360 --> 22:52.980]  assists are not...
[22:52.980 --> 22:55.340]  I find things that...
[22:55.340 --> 22:57.320]  Unless you've directly hit it beforehand,
[22:57.560 --> 22:59.020]  you could set up a series of events
[22:59.020 --> 23:00.580]  that to me could be an assist.
[23:01.140 --> 23:01.740]  That's true.
[23:03.480 --> 23:05.380]  Just getting the ball out of our area
[23:05.380 --> 23:06.580]  to me is such an assist.
[23:07.660 --> 23:09.000]  When it's on our side
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.400]  and there's that pressure like
[23:11.520 --> 23:13.320]  we've saved it, we've saved it,
[23:13.400 --> 23:14.880]  you're not getting it off the side of the field.
[23:15.340 --> 23:17.420]  It just makes me so stressed out.
[23:17.540 --> 23:18.060]  It's the worst.
[23:18.180 --> 23:21.100]  It is the same feeling you get when watching hockey.
[23:22.340 --> 23:23.260]  If the puck
[23:23.260 --> 23:24.880]  is in your end for a little too long
[23:24.880 --> 23:27.300]  and you're like, oh no, they're going to score.
[23:27.300 --> 23:29.180]  You try to clear it
[23:29.180 --> 23:30.880]  and it doesn't quite make it. It just stays in.
[23:30.960 --> 23:32.940]  It's like, oh my god, we've been here for like a minute and a half.
[23:33.020 --> 23:34.480]  Just get it out.
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.000]  Just get this puck out of here.
[23:36.660 --> 23:38.840]  It's the exact same feeling.
[23:41.160 --> 23:41.880]  We're searching.
[23:43.200 --> 23:43.820]  We are searching.
[23:44.420 --> 23:47.340]  Is there a way for me to check what my progress is
[23:47.340 --> 23:48.640]  as far as the matches go?
[23:50.940 --> 23:53.420]  I don't remember. What is this?
[23:53.920 --> 23:55.540]  I'm going to open this golden reward thing.
[23:56.260 --> 23:57.400]  Black market drop.
[23:57.620 --> 23:59.380]  I'm going to watch this stream to see this.
[24:00.100 --> 24:01.080]  Yeah, I don't know what this is.
[24:01.200 --> 24:02.000]  You're in the black market?
[24:02.600 --> 24:03.700]  I guess so, man.
[24:05.160 --> 24:06.700]  Is this a new car?
[24:07.340 --> 24:08.420]  Oh, that was pretty cool.
[24:08.580 --> 24:09.900]  Or just a decal. That was cool.
[24:10.800 --> 24:12.480]  I think it's just a decal.
[24:14.560 --> 24:16.640]  I think this map is smaller, Andrew.
[24:19.500 --> 24:21.620]  I feel like this is bigger than the last one,
[24:21.700 --> 24:23.710]  but I think maybe it's just how it presents.
[24:23.710 --> 24:25.450]  It's the water.
[24:25.770 --> 24:26.250]  Yeah.
[24:26.510 --> 24:27.710]  The water physics.
[24:32.170 --> 24:33.710]  Let's see if I can...
[24:36.890 --> 24:38.850]  Slow that guy down at least.
[24:40.190 --> 24:42.210]  They're using some special jumpies.
[24:42.430 --> 24:42.730]  Got it.
[24:42.910 --> 24:43.490]  Nice hit.
[24:46.770 --> 24:48.990]  Love to get some more boost.
[24:49.410 --> 24:49.950]  Good, clear.
[24:49.950 --> 24:51.050]  Oh, Nick!
[24:51.770 --> 24:53.230]  Oh, damn it!
[24:53.410 --> 24:54.510]  That was so good.
[24:55.730 --> 24:57.810]  Okay, let's bounce back down the left.
[24:59.030 --> 25:00.070]  Nice hit.
[25:00.370 --> 25:01.230]  Let's see if I can...
[25:01.230 --> 25:02.770]  Oh, they're flying.
[25:03.970 --> 25:05.650]  I don't like these guys.
[25:05.970 --> 25:07.210]  Don't have that. I don't either.
[25:08.530 --> 25:09.750]  Talk about also intimidating.
[25:10.250 --> 25:11.830]  The fly guys.
[25:11.970 --> 25:13.810]  Oh, the fly guys are so intimidating.
[25:15.570 --> 25:16.390]  Okay, nice.
[25:16.390 --> 25:18.570]  There's a dude I worked with in broadcast.
[25:18.710 --> 25:19.650]  His name is Michael Lindblad.
[25:19.750 --> 25:21.730]  He's great at what he does, but in this game,
[25:21.830 --> 25:23.210]  he's insanely good.
[25:24.970 --> 25:27.790]  Oh, man.
[25:28.670 --> 25:29.630]  I just want to watch.
[25:29.690 --> 25:31.450]  I can't see from how far away I am.
[25:31.790 --> 25:33.150]  It's nice to get these replays.
[25:33.610 --> 25:36.310]  Look at you. You pantsed that guy.
[25:36.330 --> 25:36.570]  That felt good.
[25:38.110 --> 25:42.010]  I danced. We were dancing.
[25:43.690 --> 25:45.070]  Oh, look at that!
[25:50.930 --> 25:52.690]  It's okay. You need to show that you're human
[25:52.690 --> 25:53.490]  every once in a while.
[25:58.710 --> 26:01.310]  I like having just the one goal lead
[26:01.310 --> 26:03.030]  take so much pressure off.
[26:03.710 --> 26:04.450]  Is that going in?
[26:05.070 --> 26:05.970]  I think that's going in.
[26:06.130 --> 26:07.490]  It just dropped the right way.
[26:09.030 --> 26:09.950]  I'm back. I'm back.
[26:09.950 --> 26:11.150]  I don't like that angle.
[26:13.090 --> 26:13.990]  Let's get it out of here.
[26:14.290 --> 26:15.030]  Nice job, Nick.
[26:15.770 --> 26:16.210]  Thank you.
[26:17.790 --> 26:19.130]  That's over. Maybe. Yeah!
[26:19.130 --> 26:20.630]  No, it's not over. It's perfect.
[26:22.810 --> 26:24.370]  Piss Rats in the chat, baby!
[26:26.950 --> 26:28.130]  Nick, this is ridiculous.
[26:28.870 --> 26:30.250]  What rank are you in this game?
[26:31.030 --> 26:32.230]  I'm gold one, I guess.
[26:32.790 --> 26:33.970]  I don't know what that means,
[26:34.050 --> 26:35.090]  but it should be higher.
[26:36.910 --> 26:38.030]  I'm back. I'm back.
[26:39.190 --> 26:40.350]  We both bailed.
[26:40.490 --> 26:41.690]  Oh, no.
[26:42.730 --> 26:43.310]  Uh-oh.
[26:43.510 --> 26:45.450]  Oh, you challenged. Nice.
[26:45.990 --> 26:47.490]  I got a challenge at the very least.
[26:47.710 --> 26:49.690]  I got to at least present like I know what I'm doing.
[26:50.370 --> 26:51.330]  It's coming your way.
[26:53.090 --> 26:53.690]  We're okay.
[26:53.910 --> 26:54.350]  Nice.
[26:55.850 --> 26:58.350]  I took a gamble that he was going to follow up just right.
[26:58.570 --> 26:59.530]  You go. You got it.
[26:59.850 --> 27:01.450]  Nope! Nope! That was dumb.
[27:01.690 --> 27:02.650]  That was real dumb.
[27:03.110 --> 27:05.970]  That was all me. That was so my fault.
[27:05.970 --> 27:07.550]  I hit it too early.
[27:08.110 --> 27:09.790]  Watch this. Look at this stupidity.
[27:10.810 --> 27:12.590]  I had no reason to do that.
[27:12.710 --> 27:14.430]  It was like I was trying to dodge it on purpose.
[27:15.210 --> 27:15.550]  Fuck.
[27:16.210 --> 27:17.830]  That's fine. You'll get six more goals.
[27:18.110 --> 27:18.670]  It's all good.
[27:19.250 --> 27:21.750]  Okay, I'll go. I'll push on this.
[27:23.970 --> 27:24.450]  Oh, there we go.
[27:24.490 --> 27:25.010]  Got it.
[27:25.750 --> 27:27.810]  Oh, nice cross.
[27:28.850 --> 27:29.490]  Ah, fuck.
[27:29.950 --> 27:30.730]  I'll see if I can set you here.
[27:32.270 --> 27:32.690]  There you go.
[27:32.690 --> 27:33.570]  Shit. Okay.
[27:34.730 --> 27:35.590]  It's a little far.
[27:35.670 --> 27:37.590]  Sorry, I was across the other way trying to get a boost.
[27:42.370 --> 27:43.490]  Shit. Okay.
[27:43.630 --> 27:44.210]  I'll fall back.
[27:44.750 --> 27:47.170]  Okay, I'm in goal.
[27:47.670 --> 27:49.250]  Ah, fuck. I was going to hit it.
[27:51.350 --> 27:51.910]  It's all right.
[27:52.030 --> 27:53.770]  Even if you mess him up, that's still something.
[27:53.850 --> 27:56.330]  It's just ugly. The ball is just ugly.
[27:58.730 --> 27:59.890]  Everything is ugly.
[27:59.890 --> 28:00.330]  Yeah.
[28:01.550 --> 28:02.630]  I'll see if I can set you here.
[28:04.390 --> 28:05.170]  That's for you.
[28:06.610 --> 28:07.350]  Oh, get in.
[28:07.790 --> 28:08.490]  Too far.
[28:09.130 --> 28:10.770]  Great set, though. That was awesome, man.
[28:10.790 --> 28:12.610]  Okay, going back.
[28:14.110 --> 28:15.250]  All right, beat that guy to the boost.
[28:15.810 --> 28:17.490]  That guy is floundering. I'm back.
[28:17.810 --> 28:18.310]  Nice hit.
[28:19.530 --> 28:20.750]  Get it back over there.
[28:23.250 --> 28:23.630]  Yeah.
[28:23.990 --> 28:24.370]  Nice.
[28:25.610 --> 28:27.770]  Oh, I missed it. But if you got that, go for it.
[28:28.210 --> 28:28.630]  Nice.
[28:29.570 --> 28:30.510]  Kept it over there. Perfect.
[28:31.430 --> 28:33.510]  This is it. For you.
[28:34.630 --> 28:35.870]  Oh, damn it.
[28:36.070 --> 28:36.330]  Okay.
[28:37.410 --> 28:38.670]  Good job going back.
[28:39.750 --> 28:41.310]  I mean, at least we're keeping the pressure on him.
[28:41.430 --> 28:43.270]  That didn't go in, but you know that.
[28:43.270 --> 28:45.550]  Oh, I missed. I got it. Nice.
[28:46.090 --> 28:47.790]  That worked out even better than if I touched it.
[28:48.310 --> 28:48.730]  Absolutely.
[28:49.730 --> 28:50.130]  Oh.
[28:50.350 --> 28:52.750]  Oh, no.
[28:53.910 --> 28:54.470]  We're okay.
[28:55.670 --> 28:56.110]  Yes!
[28:56.650 --> 28:57.530]  Nice save.
[28:59.910 --> 29:01.170]  Getting the boost.
[29:02.130 --> 29:02.770]  This one's a workout.
[29:04.630 --> 29:05.750]  All right, got him past that guy.
[29:06.390 --> 29:06.830]  Yes!
[29:09.070 --> 29:09.950]  Grab this.
[29:12.590 --> 29:13.870]  You go. I'll hold back.
[29:13.950 --> 29:16.090]  Just one more goal would be so nice.
[29:16.230 --> 29:17.810]  This is so much more stressful.
[29:18.990 --> 29:19.990]  Let's see what we can do.
[29:20.990 --> 29:22.110]  Only a minute left.
[29:26.150 --> 29:26.670]  Ah.
[29:26.910 --> 29:28.230]  You got it.
[29:28.510 --> 29:28.970]  Nope.
[29:30.070 --> 29:32.150]  You said it perfectly to me.
[29:32.250 --> 29:33.190]  That was so perfect.
[29:34.870 --> 29:35.570]  I'm back.
[29:36.350 --> 29:36.870]  48.
[29:38.230 --> 29:39.710]  Okay, we got this.
[29:39.870 --> 29:41.290]  Let's see if they tap it.
[29:41.530 --> 29:42.990]  Fuck me.
[29:43.510 --> 29:45.350]  Nice. Good job, Nick.
[29:46.450 --> 29:47.230]  40 seconds.
[29:47.770 --> 29:48.730]  40 more seconds.
[29:50.590 --> 29:52.150]  Okay, let's see what happens here.
[29:52.150 --> 29:52.550]  Ooh.
[29:54.850 --> 29:55.530]  Oh!
[29:55.730 --> 29:58.250]  Oh! God, get in!
[29:58.450 --> 29:58.830]  Yeah!
[29:59.450 --> 30:00.130]  Oh!
[30:02.310 --> 30:03.830]  Oh, man.
[30:04.150 --> 30:05.450]  They didn't know what to do.
[30:06.090 --> 30:07.270]  It hesitated so long.
[30:07.270 --> 30:08.130]  It was so trapped.
[30:09.950 --> 30:10.350]  Oh.
[30:11.510 --> 30:12.290]  We needed that.
[30:12.370 --> 30:13.550]  That was amazing.
[30:14.210 --> 30:14.710]  Just for safety.
[30:16.410 --> 30:20.250]  The other guy's giving up.
[30:20.250 --> 30:21.230]  Oh, no, he's back.
[30:23.330 --> 30:23.910]  Uh-oh.
[30:24.370 --> 30:24.630]  Oh!
[30:25.490 --> 30:26.250]  Oh, it's wide.
[30:26.390 --> 30:26.590]  Okay.
[30:30.050 --> 30:31.010]  Good clear.
[30:31.210 --> 30:32.670]  But it would have drained the clock.
[30:33.090 --> 30:33.770]  That is true.
[30:34.610 --> 30:35.470]  Every second counts.
[30:36.470 --> 30:36.890]  Oh!
[30:40.590 --> 30:42.190]  That guy had a nice hit there.
[30:45.030 --> 30:45.410]  Yeah!
[30:46.830 --> 30:48.150]  That felt like a good win.
[30:48.150 --> 30:49.890]  That felt like a competent team
[30:49.890 --> 30:51.770]  that we just got a victory over.
[30:52.630 --> 30:54.610]  Dude, that... yeah, competent team,
[30:54.770 --> 30:56.150]  but I thought you were talking about us.
[30:56.330 --> 30:57.390]  Oh, no, I mean, we did great.
[30:57.910 --> 30:58.670]  You did great.
[31:00.370 --> 31:02.070]  Three goals, you got the hat trick.
[31:03.450 --> 31:04.830]  Three shots, three goals.
[31:05.890 --> 31:06.170]  Clinical.
[31:07.370 --> 31:08.210]  Oh, you see,
[31:08.290 --> 31:10.070]  that's what I want. That's the stat I want.
[31:10.190 --> 31:12.470]  I want 100% on every shot taken.
[31:12.510 --> 31:12.830]  You know what I mean?
[31:12.950 --> 31:13.230]  Yeah.
[31:13.230 --> 31:15.350]  Okay, Matt.
[31:15.970 --> 31:17.210]  I'm at 4 of 10.
[31:20.550 --> 31:21.350]  Oh, 4 of 10?
[31:21.430 --> 31:22.430]  Really? Okay, sweet.
[31:23.510 --> 31:24.950]  We only played 4? That's crazy.
[31:27.130 --> 31:28.710]  Andrew, we won 3 of 4.
[31:29.850 --> 31:31.270]  I thought it only counted wins,
[31:31.410 --> 31:33.570]  so it's nice that we're cruising through this.
[31:34.270 --> 31:35.610]  Yeah, it's just 10 straight up,
[31:35.730 --> 31:36.590]  and then after that,
[31:37.110 --> 31:38.230]  you're in the field of play
[31:38.910 --> 31:40.910]  matched with people that are probably
[31:40.910 --> 31:41.910]  inaccurately ranked.
[31:41.910 --> 31:47.110]  I don't know
[31:47.110 --> 31:48.690]  if I've ever been ranked in this game.
[31:49.590 --> 31:50.010]  Really?
[31:50.770 --> 31:51.470]  Yeah, I don't know.
[31:51.970 --> 31:52.850]  I'm going to look at my achievements.
[31:54.450 --> 31:55.610]  Oh, never mind.
[31:59.760 --> 32:00.660]  Are we loading in?
[32:01.080 --> 32:02.680]  Oh, what the hell is happening?
[32:02.800 --> 32:03.900]  That was very weird.
[32:04.840 --> 32:05.900]  I like the farmstead.
[32:06.240 --> 32:07.860]  I like this vibe. Okay, I'm in the back.
[32:08.880 --> 32:09.300]  Ooh!
[32:11.340 --> 32:12.480]  Farm in the field, baby.
[32:12.700 --> 32:13.860]  Farm in that field.
[32:14.960 --> 32:16.040]  Are you much of a
[32:16.840 --> 32:17.720]  garden guy?
[32:20.440 --> 32:21.880]  I tried. I don't have
[32:21.880 --> 32:23.200]  the green thumb. I can't do it.
[32:24.540 --> 32:26.020]  We got a trough,
[32:26.140 --> 32:27.880]  like one of those metal troughs
[32:27.880 --> 32:29.740]  for the yard that we were going to
[32:29.740 --> 32:30.800]  grow our own
[32:34.760 --> 32:35.640]  general herbs
[32:35.640 --> 32:36.700]  and things like that.
[32:37.940 --> 32:38.820]  But alas,
[32:40.100 --> 32:41.240]  it did not...
[32:41.240 --> 32:43.120]  Well, I think it was a metal trough,
[32:43.340 --> 32:44.780]  so it kind of screwed up
[32:45.900 --> 32:47.220]  the process and made
[32:47.220 --> 32:48.200]  the soil too hot.
[32:49.920 --> 32:51.200]  I wouldn't have even thought of that.
[32:51.300 --> 32:51.860]  That's interesting.
[32:54.440 --> 32:54.600]  Okay.
[32:55.180 --> 32:56.380]  I hadn't thought of it either.
[32:58.640 --> 33:01.480]  There's nothing quite like some fresh rosemary.
[33:01.980 --> 33:03.340]  When you have that available to you,
[33:03.380 --> 33:04.440]  just go out and grab some.
[33:06.940 --> 33:08.660]  Yeah, the fresh herbs or veggies,
[33:08.660 --> 33:10.320]  if you can do your own...
[33:10.320 --> 33:12.860]  My mother-in-law does tomatoes.
[33:13.260 --> 33:14.460]  She actually does cucumbers.
[33:14.920 --> 33:16.000]  And then she makes her own pickles.
[33:16.600 --> 33:18.180]  Oh, wow. Oh, shit.
[33:18.560 --> 33:19.920]  I'm surprised that guy did not hit that.
[33:20.460 --> 33:20.640]  Okay.
[33:22.400 --> 33:23.480]  You go. I'll come back.
[33:23.720 --> 33:26.660]  I'm just trying to...
[33:27.580 --> 33:27.980]  Okay.
[33:29.560 --> 33:30.560]  It's to you.
[33:30.820 --> 33:31.000]  Nice.
[33:32.400 --> 33:33.360]  It's coming back.
[33:33.840 --> 33:35.820]  Let me see if I can...
[33:35.820 --> 33:37.100]  Oh, nice cut there.
[33:37.460 --> 33:39.500]  Ah, fuck. It kind of bounced poorly.
[33:39.500 --> 33:39.860]  It's all good.
[33:41.120 --> 33:43.100]  Oh, shit. That did not bounce the way I wanted.
[33:43.120 --> 33:44.740]  Okay, nice. I'll follow that.
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.380]  Oh, push. Yeah, push, push, push.
[33:47.180 --> 33:48.860]  Oh, Nick. That was really good.
[33:49.720 --> 33:51.820]  Let's see if we can...
[33:53.240 --> 33:53.880]  Oh, Andrew!
[33:54.120 --> 33:55.060]  Nice! I'm so sorry.
[33:55.100 --> 33:56.320]  I didn't mean to take it from you at all.
[33:56.500 --> 33:57.900]  I didn't mean to try to take that from you.
[33:57.900 --> 34:00.900]  No, it's all good. As long as it's in the net, I don't care who gets it.
[34:01.480 --> 34:02.620]  That's teamwork right there.
[34:04.060 --> 34:04.680]  That was beautiful.
[34:04.680 --> 34:05.160]  That was a double goal.
[34:06.340 --> 34:08.760]  I don't know if mine would have gone in, so that worked out perfectly.
[34:08.880 --> 34:09.640]  L-teammate.
[34:10.880 --> 34:12.300]  They don't like their teammate over there.
[34:12.440 --> 34:14.080]  They don't got the unity that we got, Nick.
[34:14.440 --> 34:15.820]  They're in trouble. They're in a fight.
[34:16.820 --> 34:20.540]  I realized how mad people messaging in this game make me.
[34:20.800 --> 34:23.500]  And I have turned off every notification in this game.
[34:23.860 --> 34:24.280]  Oh, man.
[34:25.660 --> 34:27.360]  You remember, like, in the 360 area,
[34:27.580 --> 34:28.240]  where you'd get...
[34:28.240 --> 34:29.420]  Era, not area.
[34:29.420 --> 34:31.460]  Where you'd get voice messages?
[34:32.120 --> 34:32.660]  Oh, yeah.
[34:33.180 --> 34:36.060]  I used to leave them all the time.
[34:38.620 --> 34:40.200]  Especially the people who quit.
[34:40.340 --> 34:41.280]  Like, you piece of...
[34:41.280 --> 34:43.440]  How dare you. You coward.
[34:44.380 --> 34:46.060]  We needed you.
[34:47.160 --> 34:49.040]  Oh, is that in?
[34:49.540 --> 34:50.280]  Oh, no.
[34:52.180 --> 34:53.900]  Oh, now it's okay.
[34:59.280 --> 35:00.620]  Oh, that bounced just right.
[35:00.620 --> 35:02.620]  Oh, nice hit, though.
[35:02.960 --> 35:03.480]  Thanks, man.
[35:05.180 --> 35:06.680]  Get some more boost.
[35:08.300 --> 35:09.640]  Stop him from doing that.
[35:10.700 --> 35:11.600]  Over that way.
[35:12.780 --> 35:14.760]  See if I can center you.
[35:14.920 --> 35:15.480]  Oh, sorry.
[35:16.580 --> 35:17.160]  You did great.
[35:18.300 --> 35:20.480]  You did a good job in clearing it.
[35:21.320 --> 35:21.560]  Yeah!
[35:22.840 --> 35:24.300]  I hit the roof.
[35:25.440 --> 35:26.560]  I'm going for another...
[35:26.560 --> 35:28.260]  I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm doing something.
[35:29.080 --> 35:29.520]  Okay.
[35:29.880 --> 35:31.240]  Bounce that back to you, maybe?
[35:34.400 --> 35:34.940]  Oh, no.
[35:36.440 --> 35:36.600]  Oh, shit.
[35:37.220 --> 35:40.260]  Oh, they're both...
[35:41.220 --> 35:42.180]  Oh, it's white.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.740]  Fuck, I'm just ramming into them.
[35:47.480 --> 35:47.920]  Go, Nick!
[35:49.080 --> 35:49.960]  Oh, damn!
[35:50.360 --> 35:51.860]  If I had any more boost...
[35:51.860 --> 35:52.320]  You got that.
[35:53.960 --> 35:56.100]  It's going up. I'm going up with it.
[35:56.860 --> 35:58.200]  Also, we'd like to apologize,
[35:58.520 --> 36:00.500]  chat, for not paying attention to you at all right now.
[36:00.540 --> 36:01.340]  Yeah, I'm so sorry.
[36:01.920 --> 36:03.120]  Oh, no!
[36:04.700 --> 36:05.560]  Okay, we're all right.
[36:13.430 --> 36:14.230]  We understand.
[36:14.390 --> 36:16.170]  Thank you, stream kind of guy.
[36:18.490 --> 36:19.170]  You go.
[36:20.170 --> 36:20.670]  Okay, I'm pushing.
[36:21.670 --> 36:22.350]  We can do this.
[36:24.010 --> 36:26.450]  It wasn't first touch, but...
[36:26.450 --> 36:27.070]  it wasn't terrible.
[36:27.730 --> 36:29.150]  Nice, it's on their side.
[36:30.050 --> 36:30.830]  There you go.
[36:32.530 --> 36:33.350]  Let's see.
[36:33.830 --> 36:37.070]  Let me...
[36:37.850 --> 36:39.290]  You're dribbling all over.
[36:41.130 --> 36:43.350]  All right, let's...
[36:43.350 --> 36:44.230]  Nice.
[36:44.810 --> 36:45.370]  Here we go.
[36:45.690 --> 36:47.590]  You got it, Nick!
[36:49.230 --> 36:50.730]  Good job, man.
[36:51.130 --> 36:53.230]  I just needed to get it past that guy.
[36:53.230 --> 36:53.390]  Haha!
[36:55.270 --> 36:56.910]  Oh, so good.
[36:58.750 --> 37:00.430]  You go, I'll follow.
[37:00.750 --> 37:01.310]  Sorry.
[37:03.050 --> 37:05.090]  We're both in the same awkward
[37:05.090 --> 37:05.890]  side angle.
[37:06.770 --> 37:08.310]  It was not obvious.
[37:11.010 --> 37:12.410]  I'm back here, let's see.
[37:13.810 --> 37:14.570]  Yeah, you got that.
[37:14.650 --> 37:15.530]  No, I don't.
[37:16.190 --> 37:17.610]  Good job.
[37:18.850 --> 37:20.930]  Oh, no. Okay, I'm back.
[37:20.930 --> 37:21.530]  I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
[37:21.710 --> 37:23.330]  All right, I'm circling.
[37:24.370 --> 37:26.010]  You come out. All right, I'm back.
[37:26.410 --> 37:27.430]  I'll hold here for a sec.
[37:28.330 --> 37:28.890]  We're good.
[37:29.590 --> 37:30.030]  Oh, no!
[37:31.770 --> 37:33.950]  I launched it off of him into our goal.
[37:35.070 --> 37:36.350]  If they're gonna get a goal,
[37:36.530 --> 37:37.690]  I want it to be that way.
[37:37.730 --> 37:39.150]  I want to hear you go, we're good.
[37:39.530 --> 37:40.990]  And then it just bounced back in.
[37:42.610 --> 37:43.670]  That was a hell of a try.
[37:44.510 --> 37:45.950]  It's all you, I'm in that.
[37:46.850 --> 37:47.670]  This is my good OT.
[37:49.110 --> 37:50.090]  Get a quick one.
[37:50.930 --> 37:52.670]  Oh, we can do it, we can do it.
[37:52.670 --> 37:53.530]  Plenty of time.
[37:54.330 --> 37:55.150]  Getting that boost.
[37:59.510 --> 38:00.450]  That's coming back.
[38:01.850 --> 38:03.050]  Get in there!
[38:03.690 --> 38:04.110]  Get in there!
[38:04.630 --> 38:05.970]  Holy shit!
[38:06.910 --> 38:07.430]  Nick!
[38:08.290 --> 38:11.450]  I was just going back and forth in our own goal.
[38:12.590 --> 38:13.690]  You're 2v1, 1v2ing?
[38:15.910 --> 38:16.770]  Oh, that's awesome.
[38:17.410 --> 38:19.190]  That felt so good.
[38:19.250 --> 38:20.050]  I'm in that, you go.
[38:22.010 --> 38:22.810]  Piss Rats!
[38:24.490 --> 38:25.250]  They're out.
[38:32.110 --> 38:33.310]  Oh, that was a good cross.
[38:34.330 --> 38:35.010]  That felt good.
[38:35.150 --> 38:36.250]  Let me see if I can set you here.
[38:38.590 --> 38:39.450]  You got that, maybe?
[38:41.210 --> 38:42.290]  Oh, I missed.
[38:42.530 --> 38:43.430]  That was so close.
[38:45.470 --> 38:46.670]  Shit, shit, shit, shit.
[38:49.410 --> 38:49.850]  I'm back.
[38:49.850 --> 38:53.110]  That did not hit it.
[38:57.570 --> 38:59.190]  My brain disconnected.
[38:59.730 --> 39:00.530]  It just went off.
[39:00.850 --> 39:04.270]  I said the did when I meant to say died.
[39:04.550 --> 39:05.810]  And then it just...
[39:05.810 --> 39:08.010]  I was gone, brain dancing
[39:08.010 --> 39:08.910]  in our own goal.
[39:09.570 --> 39:10.090]  Oh, no.
[39:12.850 --> 39:13.490]  Okay.
[39:16.410 --> 39:17.690]  Oh, man.
[39:18.530 --> 39:19.170]  That's okay.
[39:19.290 --> 39:21.270]  That was on me.
[39:21.430 --> 39:23.350]  I checked out mentally. I was like, oh, we won this.
[39:23.450 --> 39:24.010]  This is great.
[39:25.750 --> 39:26.630]  We did not.
[39:27.170 --> 39:28.010]  You stay.
[39:30.510 --> 39:32.770]  Oh, jeez.
[39:33.330 --> 39:33.950]  Nice, Nick.
[39:35.070 --> 39:36.170]  I missed it.
[39:37.050 --> 39:38.630]  Maybe drop, drop, drop.
[39:40.950 --> 39:41.790]  Get in there.
[39:42.430 --> 39:42.630]  Yes!
[39:42.630 --> 39:43.190]  Nick!
[39:46.050 --> 39:47.710]  This is insane.
[39:48.170 --> 39:49.390]  Andrew, I don't know what's happening.
[39:49.630 --> 39:52.130]  This is the best Rocket League performance I've ever seen.
[39:52.410 --> 39:54.130]  I don't know what's going on right now.
[39:54.190 --> 39:56.530]  Oh, my God, thank you for all the gifted subs.
[39:56.970 --> 39:57.790]  Oh, thank y'all.
[40:00.190 --> 40:01.710]  That was... oh, my God.
[40:02.290 --> 40:04.090]  Here, let me shower you in cash.
[40:04.810 --> 40:06.070]  You get some of that Disney money.
[40:06.830 --> 40:07.290]  Turn the money.
[40:09.910 --> 40:10.350]  Insane.
[40:11.250 --> 40:11.610]  Oh.
[40:13.910 --> 40:14.630]  I'm still...
[40:15.790 --> 40:16.630]  I'm Gold 1,
[40:16.730 --> 40:18.010]  Division 4 now.
[40:18.370 --> 40:20.330]  That is too complicated of a system.
[40:22.350 --> 40:22.990]  We'll see.
[40:23.270 --> 40:24.910]  Yours is going to be like Platinum 3.
[40:25.610 --> 40:26.330]  Oh, my God.
[40:26.370 --> 40:28.470]  If I get higher than you, that would be so undeserved.
[40:28.930 --> 40:30.070]  There's no way that will happen.
[40:30.690 --> 40:31.830]  Dude, that's how the game works.
[40:32.250 --> 40:33.990]  That's how the game works, and my friends are always like,
[40:34.050 --> 40:36.070]  oh, man, Nick's just dragging us down all the time.
[40:38.190 --> 40:39.530]  Yeah, you sons of bitches.
[40:43.290 --> 40:43.750]  Nice.
[40:46.090 --> 40:46.830]  Let's see.
[40:47.290 --> 40:47.610]  Okay.
[40:48.510 --> 40:49.050]  You got it.
[40:49.190 --> 40:50.070]  A little bit of bounce.
[40:50.270 --> 40:50.970]  I'll follow it.
[40:51.890 --> 40:52.350]  Nice.
[40:55.690 --> 40:56.730]  That's going to get hit.
[40:58.130 --> 40:58.930]  Oh, I missed.
[40:59.070 --> 40:59.270]  Yours.
[41:00.510 --> 41:01.150]  We're okay.
[41:01.150 --> 41:02.570]  Yeah, I'm going back.
[41:03.090 --> 41:04.030]  I'll harass.
[41:04.870 --> 41:05.150]  Hooray.
[41:08.070 --> 41:08.990]  I tried.
[41:09.290 --> 41:10.410]  I tried real hard.
[41:11.770 --> 41:14.070]  For some reason, the wall is the hard...
[41:14.070 --> 41:15.030]  Uh-oh, that's not good.
[41:15.250 --> 41:15.870]  I'll be back here.
[41:16.010 --> 41:16.930]  Oh, nice.
[41:17.270 --> 41:22.860]  Ah, it's past me.
[41:26.280 --> 41:26.960]  Let's see.
[41:27.060 --> 41:29.860]  Oh, I just missed.
[41:29.940 --> 41:31.300]  That was such a good set.
[41:34.540 --> 41:35.480]  Oh, nice.
[41:37.740 --> 41:39.120]  Ah, I bailed.
[41:39.200 --> 41:39.640]  I bailed.
[41:41.060 --> 41:42.440]  It's coming in too hot.
[41:43.480 --> 41:44.400]  Nice hit.
[41:44.760 --> 41:45.440]  Thank you.
[41:46.820 --> 41:48.020]  We're getting close.
[41:48.240 --> 41:48.860]  We're narrowing in.
[41:49.400 --> 41:50.900]  They're getting even closer.
[41:52.660 --> 41:53.100]  You got it.
[41:54.700 --> 41:55.520]  Nice hit.
[41:55.880 --> 41:56.480]  Thank you.
[41:58.160 --> 41:59.700]  Yeah, you do.
[42:00.400 --> 42:01.940]  I'm back a bit.
[42:04.400 --> 42:04.880]  Nice.
[42:06.020 --> 42:07.160]  Great side swipe.
[42:08.040 --> 42:08.500]  Thank you.
[42:08.860 --> 42:11.260]  That did not go nearly as far as I was hoping it would.
[42:11.300 --> 42:11.740]  I'm going to hold.
[42:13.280 --> 42:14.820]  Part of me was tempted to chase.
[42:17.780 --> 42:19.540]  Oh, nice.
[42:19.800 --> 42:20.360]  Thank you.
[42:22.360 --> 42:23.800]  Okay, this is interesting.
[42:24.280 --> 42:24.520]  Shit.
[42:24.980 --> 42:25.620]  That's wide.
[42:25.620 --> 42:26.740]  Oh!
[42:28.100 --> 42:29.060]  Went across net.
[42:29.060 --> 42:29.780]  That was close.
[42:31.380 --> 42:32.780]  Fuck. Good job.
[42:33.700 --> 42:34.280]  Thank you.
[42:35.140 --> 42:36.120]  Nice, Nick.
[42:37.500 --> 42:38.620]  Let's see if we can...
[42:38.620 --> 42:41.000]  Oh, he took my boost. Son of a bitch.
[42:43.380 --> 42:44.560]  That's weak. Sorry.
[42:44.840 --> 42:45.400]  That's okay.
[42:46.740 --> 42:47.780]  Battling in those corners.
[42:54.190 --> 42:55.830]  Saved by the keeper.
[42:55.830 --> 42:57.470]  There you go. Take the shot.
[42:58.310 --> 43:01.670]  That was so good. I'm so sorry.
[43:02.150 --> 43:02.750]  That's okay.
[43:03.830 --> 43:04.850]  Oh, this is bad.
[43:05.230 --> 43:07.210]  Real bad.
[43:07.610 --> 43:09.110]  Nice save, Nick.
[43:12.330 --> 43:13.530]  Okay, falling back.
[43:14.210 --> 43:15.370]  I'm in the corner. I'm in my head.
[43:15.530 --> 43:15.990]  Got to get out.
[43:16.410 --> 43:20.870]  Here we go.
[43:21.530 --> 43:23.490]  Get that out of here.
[43:24.910 --> 43:25.830]  Give it a follow.
[43:29.390 --> 43:29.830]  Nice.
[43:31.070 --> 43:33.230]  You don't even need me. You feed yourself.
[43:33.450 --> 43:34.370]  You do your own crosses.
[43:35.070 --> 43:35.970]  Insane, Nick.
[43:36.650 --> 43:38.690]  Look at this. Look at this replay.
[43:38.810 --> 43:39.830]  He feeds himself.
[43:41.310 --> 43:42.550]  He's cooking and scoring.
[43:43.950 --> 43:44.910]  That was incredible.
[43:45.130 --> 43:47.250]  I would normally not have gone for that,
[43:47.330 --> 43:48.590]  but I wasn't sure where he was,
[43:48.670 --> 43:50.130]  so I thought if I could at least
[43:50.830 --> 43:52.310]  pressure them on the corner,
[43:52.310 --> 43:54.210]  that you'd have a better shot.
[43:54.350 --> 43:55.170]  But it worked out.
[43:55.250 --> 43:58.330]  You don't even need me.
[44:00.590 --> 44:01.710]  I do need you,
[44:01.830 --> 44:04.130]  because we've been setting each other up so well here.
[44:04.190 --> 44:04.990]  Oh, look at that!
[44:06.290 --> 44:06.730]  Yeah!
[44:07.110 --> 44:07.410]  Okay.
[44:09.550 --> 44:12.690]  Let me see if I can...
[44:12.690 --> 44:13.190]  Oh, okay.
[44:14.490 --> 44:15.210]  There you go, maybe?
[44:15.450 --> 44:16.430]  No, too weak.
[44:19.310 --> 44:19.930]  Nice hit.
[44:19.930 --> 44:21.190]  Thank you.
[44:24.390 --> 44:25.350]  Nice shot.
[44:25.770 --> 44:26.590]  It's just wide.
[44:27.250 --> 44:28.850]  Let me see if I can...
[44:29.690 --> 44:30.170]  Misjudged.
[44:30.470 --> 44:31.030]  Oh, you got it.
[44:31.650 --> 44:33.290]  Sort of. We both hit it.
[44:34.830 --> 44:36.330]  If I had boost, I would have hit that.
[44:38.590 --> 44:39.070]  Bump!
[44:39.510 --> 44:39.990]  Finally!
[44:40.570 --> 44:41.690]  I'm on the board!
[44:42.310 --> 44:42.950]  I knew something!
[44:44.630 --> 44:45.310]  There's a goal!
[44:46.930 --> 44:47.450]  Oh!
[44:48.210 --> 44:48.230]  Oh!
[44:48.810 --> 44:52.230]  I like that we were having these nice conversations.
[44:52.590 --> 44:53.310]  And we still are.
[44:53.410 --> 44:54.550]  But we kind of devolved into,
[44:54.710 --> 44:55.690]  here we go, you go here.
[44:56.430 --> 44:58.250]  We gotta get this rank going.
[44:58.850 --> 44:59.890]  We gotta be serious about this.
[45:03.090 --> 45:04.270]  That scared me.
[45:07.030 --> 45:07.870]  Good try.
[45:08.830 --> 45:11.490]  I'm gonna try to tap it back.
[45:11.750 --> 45:12.750]  Nope, nope, nope.
[45:14.410 --> 45:15.930]  Sorry, I hit you.
[45:16.130 --> 45:17.130]  That was a disaster.
[45:17.850 --> 45:18.530]  On my end.
[45:19.030 --> 45:19.850]  It worked out perfectly.
[45:21.250 --> 45:22.550]  All is planned.
[45:23.750 --> 45:24.650]  Oh, shit.
[45:24.830 --> 45:25.410]  Going back.
[45:25.470 --> 45:27.230]  Couldn't draw that one up.
[45:30.250 --> 45:30.750]  Nice.
[45:31.350 --> 45:32.310]  I'll chill here for a sec.
[45:32.630 --> 45:33.750]  Shit, they got the...
[45:33.750 --> 45:34.010]  Yeah.
[45:40.740 --> 45:41.740]  Olé, olé.
[45:42.600 --> 45:43.120]  Ah, fuck.
[45:43.120 --> 45:44.640]  Olé, olé, olé.
[45:45.840 --> 45:46.980]  Running back.
[45:48.440 --> 45:49.300]  Got it.
[45:51.720 --> 45:52.580]  Bounced it.
[45:53.560 --> 45:55.300]  Nice, good kick out.
[45:56.180 --> 45:56.640]  Hey, oh.
[45:58.140 --> 45:59.660]  Let's let that clock run.
[46:03.260 --> 46:04.500]  Alright, here we go.
[46:04.660 --> 46:05.040]  Circling.
[46:05.560 --> 46:05.860]  Oh!
[46:08.780 --> 46:10.060]  Oh, Nick!
[46:11.700 --> 46:12.300]  Damn.
[46:12.600 --> 46:13.020]  Just wide.
[46:13.280 --> 46:13.520]  Ooh!
[46:16.060 --> 46:16.660]  Yeah!
[46:17.380 --> 46:19.960]  That was so disrespectful, Nick!
[46:20.300 --> 46:21.520]  That was so unnecessary.
[46:21.800 --> 46:22.460]  I love it.
[46:23.800 --> 46:25.700]  Oh, that was so mean.
[46:26.680 --> 46:27.040]  Go!
[46:28.060 --> 46:28.540]  Three!
[46:31.800 --> 46:33.860]  That was super necessary.
[46:35.160 --> 46:36.460]  Oh, I mean...
[46:36.460 --> 46:37.640]  One second left.
[46:37.640 --> 46:39.640]  That was disrespectful, but...
[46:40.340 --> 46:43.720]  It was great. You gotta get those stats up. You gotta get into Division 5 or whatever.
[46:44.180 --> 46:45.580]  You're just supposed to dribble it out.
[46:45.640 --> 46:47.140]  You're not supposed to dunk on them at the end.
[46:47.640 --> 46:49.320]  Damn, six of ten matches played.
[46:49.380 --> 46:50.420]  We just gotta do four more.
[46:50.660 --> 46:52.100]  We're flying through this.
[46:52.680 --> 46:54.700]  Piss in the wind is really funny.
[46:57.600 --> 46:58.560]  Great line chat.
[47:01.860 --> 47:03.240]  Oh, that's such a good line.
[47:04.700 --> 47:05.500]  Salty shores.
[47:07.140 --> 47:08.160]  Salty fest.
[47:08.340 --> 47:10.080]  It's us playing Chain together.
[47:13.320 --> 47:15.160]  The finest of the salt.
[47:16.300 --> 47:16.900]  Nice!
[47:17.460 --> 47:18.100]  Good push.
[47:18.840 --> 47:19.460]  Let's see.
[47:21.120 --> 47:23.780]  Okay, these guys are pretty decent.
[47:25.840 --> 47:26.480]  Get it down.
[47:30.240 --> 47:31.140]  Crossed again.
[47:31.440 --> 47:32.140]  Oh, shit.
[47:32.620 --> 47:33.340]  Oh, balls.
[47:33.460 --> 47:35.880]  You go, you go, you go.
[47:35.980 --> 47:36.640]  I'm on it.
[47:39.200 --> 47:42.440]  Alright, I'm back. I'm gonna chill here for a second.
[47:43.440 --> 47:44.460]  See what this guy does.
[47:44.640 --> 47:45.880]  Okay, they're crossing. Yeah, you're right.
[47:46.060 --> 47:47.680]  They seem competent.
[47:48.620 --> 47:51.120]  They're trying to do aerial shit, which makes me scared.
[47:52.800 --> 47:53.160]  Fuck!
[47:54.000 --> 47:54.700]  Okay, we're alright.
[47:56.400 --> 47:57.860]  We may have crossed that line.
[47:59.040 --> 47:59.760]  Yeah, we...
[47:59.760 --> 48:01.860]  The game might be judging us harshly as good.
[48:02.180 --> 48:02.660]  Okay.
[48:03.220 --> 48:04.260]  Alright, here we go.
[48:06.280 --> 48:07.120]  Let's see.
[48:09.680 --> 48:10.200]  Nice.
[48:10.800 --> 48:11.920]  That guy's got that, yeah.
[48:16.440 --> 48:17.300]  Ah, damn.
[48:21.070 --> 48:21.910]  Oh, fuck!
[48:22.010 --> 48:22.990]  That just went right to him.
[48:24.550 --> 48:25.310]  That's over?
[48:25.590 --> 48:25.790]  Yeah.
[48:26.670 --> 48:27.050]  Okay.
[48:29.050 --> 48:30.570]  This really is salty.
[48:30.570 --> 48:32.170]  This is sweaty, salty.
[48:34.320 --> 48:35.150]  Sweaty is salty.
[48:40.440 --> 48:42.120]  Alright, let's see what we got here.
[48:43.820 --> 48:44.240]  Oh!
[48:45.860 --> 48:47.480]  Yes! Go, go, go, go!
[48:47.800 --> 48:48.200]  Yeah!
[48:50.360 --> 48:51.520]  Way to follow it.
[48:51.680 --> 48:52.640]  We're tied. Hell yeah.
[48:53.040 --> 48:53.280]  Okay.
[48:54.980 --> 48:56.420]  We gotta lock in here.
[48:57.140 --> 48:58.140]  Perfect shot.
[48:59.560 --> 49:01.200]  I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
[49:01.200 --> 49:01.820]  Alright.
[49:03.220 --> 49:05.760]  Oh, yeah, they're doing that little hop-skip shit at the front.
[49:11.580 --> 49:11.980]  Alright.
[49:14.300 --> 49:15.160]  Nice, nice.
[49:16.340 --> 49:16.740]  Nice.
[49:22.270 --> 49:22.670]  Shit!
[49:22.950 --> 49:24.070]  That was...
[49:24.070 --> 49:25.030]  I don't like that.
[49:25.490 --> 49:27.350]  I don't like that he was able to do that.
[49:28.270 --> 49:30.330]  Yeah, and he did a little hop and a skip there, didn't he?
[49:31.030 --> 49:31.330]  Okay.
[49:32.650 --> 49:33.930]  That was not...
[49:33.930 --> 49:35.690]  That was just...
[49:35.690 --> 49:36.390]  I'll take blame.
[49:37.110 --> 49:38.190]  No, it's okay, it's all good.
[49:39.190 --> 49:41.910]  I was trying to swoop in here, and I think I got in your way.
[49:42.490 --> 49:43.990]  We definitely hit, but...
[49:43.990 --> 49:44.690]  Okay, you're in net.
[49:45.590 --> 49:47.590]  Alright, we're good. Yeah, I'll be back for now.
[49:48.210 --> 49:48.810]  Oh, nice!
[49:49.310 --> 49:50.630]  That was, I feel like, his fuck-up.
[49:50.750 --> 49:52.330]  I didn't even, I feel like, touch it.
[49:56.300 --> 49:57.860]  They're doing aerial shit.
[49:58.580 --> 49:59.120]  Oh, there you go.
[50:00.140 --> 50:00.360]  Oh!
[50:01.160 --> 50:01.520]  Oh!
[50:03.360 --> 50:05.460]  That was a pretty bit of dribbling there.
[50:05.460 --> 50:06.200]  Thank you.
[50:08.180 --> 50:09.780]  Oh, that's a pretty good bit
[50:09.780 --> 50:11.040]  of scoring by you, Nick.
[50:11.340 --> 50:12.780]  Oh, that felt good.
[50:12.800 --> 50:14.620]  Pretty little bit of goal by you.
[50:19.800 --> 50:21.960]  Sometimes they play soft, so you gotta go
[50:21.960 --> 50:22.800]  a little harder in there.
[50:23.060 --> 50:25.180]  I'm a goal.
[50:26.220 --> 50:26.780]  Here we go.
[50:28.160 --> 50:28.500]  Whee!
[50:29.760 --> 50:30.700]  Nice win.
[50:32.060 --> 50:32.740]  That's... ooh.
[50:33.900 --> 50:34.160]  Okay.
[50:34.160 --> 50:36.780]  Ah, that was, yeah, he just pushed it all the way across.
[50:37.260 --> 50:38.140]  Yeah, he sure did.
[50:38.220 --> 50:39.260]  I got excited for a second.
[50:42.400 --> 50:43.020]  There we go.
[50:43.720 --> 50:45.860]  I shouldn't have done that. I should have just gone for the ball.
[50:47.380 --> 50:47.940]  I was greedy.
[50:48.340 --> 50:48.800]  Ooh, nice!
[50:49.400 --> 50:50.940]  Follow it, I'll hold back for a second.
[50:53.280 --> 50:54.580]  Okay, come on up.
[50:59.360 --> 51:00.140]  Nice, Nick!
[51:00.320 --> 51:01.020]  There we go.
[51:01.660 --> 51:04.000]  I took a gamble. It paid off a little bit.
[51:05.060 --> 51:06.000]  Let's see if you can...
[51:06.560 --> 51:06.700]  Ah.
[51:14.280 --> 51:14.640]  Okay.
[51:15.100 --> 51:16.640]  Trusted you on that one. Nice hit.
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.700]  Fuck, okay, they smashed it back.
[51:19.760 --> 51:20.340]  Oh, shit.
[51:20.740 --> 51:21.160]  That's okay.
[51:26.250 --> 51:28.390]  I'm just trying to get it out of here.
[51:28.530 --> 51:29.270]  Oh, it's coming your way.
[51:30.950 --> 51:31.690]  Aw, it bounced.
[51:32.330 --> 51:33.610]  Nice! Good clear.
[51:35.370 --> 51:35.710]  Ooh!
[51:35.770 --> 51:37.710]  I was hoping I could...
[51:37.710 --> 51:37.990]  Ooh.
[51:37.990 --> 51:38.870]  Ooh.
[51:39.830 --> 51:40.990]  Ah, damn.
[51:43.630 --> 51:43.970]  Shit.
[51:44.170 --> 51:45.190]  They beat me to it.
[51:45.410 --> 51:46.350]  I got it.
[51:49.110 --> 51:50.110]  Nice, Nick.
[51:53.570 --> 51:54.730]  Ooh, nice hit.
[51:56.830 --> 51:57.730]  I'm coming up.
[52:03.850 --> 52:05.010]  Oh, shit.
[52:05.010 --> 52:05.690]  Shit, sorry.
[52:06.130 --> 52:09.310]  That's okay, we both were not in a great spot for it.
[52:09.690 --> 52:10.630]  Nice spin.
[52:11.870 --> 52:12.510]  Let's see.
[52:13.190 --> 52:14.670]  Dancing past him a little bit here.
[52:16.070 --> 52:17.270]  Ah, that little bastard.
[52:17.930 --> 52:18.490]  Oh, get in!
[52:18.770 --> 52:19.010]  Oh!
[52:20.210 --> 52:20.610]  No!
[52:23.190 --> 52:23.670]  Uh-oh.
[52:24.410 --> 52:25.970]  Going back, going back, going back, going back.
[52:26.050 --> 52:27.990]  No easy shit, no easy shit, no easy shit.
[52:28.130 --> 52:28.750]  No bad ideas!
[52:31.450 --> 52:32.570]  Hey, coming soon.
[52:36.090 --> 52:37.190]  Coming very soon.
[52:40.150 --> 52:40.790]  There we go.
[52:40.970 --> 52:41.630]  Get that out of here.
[52:43.690 --> 52:44.050]  Okay.
[52:46.930 --> 52:47.290]  No!
[52:48.290 --> 52:49.150]  Oh, damn it!
[52:49.270 --> 52:50.270]  Okay, we're alright, we're okay.
[52:50.570 --> 52:53.150]  I tried to line it up, but I just missed.
[52:53.830 --> 52:57.650]  No, it's also my fault because I went over him, and I should have hit it to the right.
[52:57.930 --> 52:58.850]  Oh, okay, it wasn't my fault.
[52:59.470 --> 52:59.610]  Phew.
[53:01.470 --> 53:02.590]  30 seconds, we got this.
[53:03.090 --> 53:04.510]  We got this.
[53:04.690 --> 53:04.810]  Ooh.
[53:06.730 --> 53:07.830]  Okay, I kept it over here.
[53:08.010 --> 53:08.590]  Nice, nice, nice.
[53:09.670 --> 53:10.570]  Let's see what we can do.
[53:12.050 --> 53:12.410]  Nice.
[53:18.890 --> 53:19.350]  Uh-oh.
[53:19.950 --> 53:23.330]  That little douche nozzle is bullying the shit out of me.
[53:23.410 --> 53:23.830]  Here we go.
[53:28.300 --> 53:28.940]  Nice, Nick.
[53:30.960 --> 53:31.880]  You got it, you got it.
[53:32.000 --> 53:32.800]  Ah, damn it!
[53:33.680 --> 53:34.040]  Hey.
[53:34.320 --> 53:34.900]  We're not done yet.
[53:35.520 --> 53:35.840]  Yeah.
[53:36.320 --> 53:38.780]  Oh, we're not. We're not. We're not done yet!
[53:39.460 --> 53:39.740]  Ah!
[53:41.660 --> 53:42.460]  That's a hell of a game.
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.260]  I feel really good about that.
[53:44.620 --> 53:47.120]  It was a good game. It was a good game. If I could tell them GG, I would.
[53:52.260 --> 53:52.580]  Dude.
[53:53.460 --> 53:56.100]  That was insane. Hey, chat, thanks for putting up with this.
[53:57.560 --> 53:58.160]  They know.
[53:59.060 --> 54:00.300]  What game was that? Do you remember?
[54:00.360 --> 54:00.620]  Seven.
[54:01.700 --> 54:02.820]  Oh, we got three more.
[54:03.160 --> 54:04.160]  We got three more.
[54:05.080 --> 54:05.820]  Let's do it.
[54:06.780 --> 54:07.620]  It's crazy.
[54:08.020 --> 54:09.380]  We got 5-0-1 coming up.
[54:10.060 --> 54:13.220]  5-0-1, the best time of the week.
[54:13.260 --> 54:13.880]  On a Friday?
[54:14.960 --> 54:15.240]  Ugh.
[54:17.620 --> 54:18.100]  Ugh.
[54:19.260 --> 54:19.740]  Wonderful.
[54:21.300 --> 54:22.140]  Now, do you think
[54:23.100 --> 54:24.260]  we could do this,
[54:24.280 --> 54:25.160]  the two of us,
[54:25.640 --> 54:27.320]  and get one of the other guys in
[54:28.620 --> 54:29.580]  threes ranked?
[54:30.920 --> 54:32.320]  I mean, they'll certainly
[54:32.320 --> 54:33.060]  get a rank.
[54:33.780 --> 54:35.340]  What that will be, I don't know.
[54:38.200 --> 54:38.820]  But yes.
[54:38.940 --> 54:41.500]  Who do you think would be the most valuable of the three?
[54:43.520 --> 54:44.440]  That's a good question.
[54:44.580 --> 54:46.360]  I don't know how much...
[54:46.360 --> 54:47.860]  I don't think Geoff really plays.
[54:49.420 --> 54:50.340]  Eric is not really
[54:50.340 --> 54:52.240]  a multiplayer game guy, so I'd be surprised
[54:52.240 --> 54:54.220]  if he played
[54:54.220 --> 54:54.900]  a lot of this.
[54:55.760 --> 54:56.460]  Yeah, that's fair.
[54:57.060 --> 54:57.860]  Probably Gavin.
[54:59.660 --> 55:00.200]  I'd assume
[55:00.200 --> 55:00.620]  it would be the highest.
[55:00.920 --> 55:01.820]  That was me.
[55:03.780 --> 55:04.640]  That was my goal.
[55:05.560 --> 55:07.200]  It says King Julia, but really, that's me.
[55:07.280 --> 55:08.300]  Look at that tip I did.
[55:09.020 --> 55:10.600]  I centered it so good for them.
[55:12.780 --> 55:13.600]  No, but I
[55:14.200 --> 55:15.620]  could have hit that, and I did not.
[55:15.900 --> 55:18.000]  And so, I will accept responsibility.
[55:18.280 --> 55:19.180]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[55:20.820 --> 55:21.660]  There you go.
[55:22.020 --> 55:23.420]  You and I playing games together, Nick,
[55:23.440 --> 55:25.540]  is just a giant responsibility off.
[55:25.540 --> 55:27.660]  It's just you and I both trying to constantly
[55:27.660 --> 55:28.180]  claim.
[55:29.200 --> 55:30.280]  That was me.
[55:30.440 --> 55:30.880]  It was me.
[55:32.800 --> 55:34.620]  Did you see
[55:35.520 --> 55:36.660]  in the
[55:37.940 --> 55:39.460]  subreddit today that
[55:39.460 --> 55:41.640]  somebody had made a chain together
[55:41.640 --> 55:43.400]  fault? Yes, the detailed statistics.
[55:44.120 --> 55:45.280]  And then also, like,
[55:45.300 --> 55:46.820]  accepting responsibility for.
[55:47.060 --> 55:50.060]  Didn't realize I denied it that many times.
[55:50.720 --> 55:51.400]  Nick!
[55:52.180 --> 55:53.540]  What a save!
[55:55.000 --> 55:55.400]  Holy
[55:55.860 --> 55:56.260]  shit!
[55:58.400 --> 55:59.220]  That was incredible!
[56:00.080 --> 56:01.600]  Oh, that was all about
[56:01.600 --> 56:03.480]  placement, my man, and I was just in the right spot
[56:03.480 --> 56:04.220]  at the right time.
[56:05.920 --> 56:07.040]  Okay, going back.
[56:08.800 --> 56:09.620]  Yeah, these guys
[56:09.620 --> 56:10.540]  I think are pretty decent.
[56:14.400 --> 56:15.720]  That guy's gonna beat me to it.
[56:19.960 --> 56:21.500]  Nicely done. Thank you.
[56:23.280 --> 56:24.000]  But also,
[56:24.160 --> 56:25.280]  apparently Gavin is the
[56:25.280 --> 56:27.540]  person who does not
[56:27.540 --> 56:29.520]  accept responsibility. I think his was like
[56:29.520 --> 56:31.680]  40% and mine was like 60% or
[56:31.680 --> 56:33.540]  80%. And then you are like
[56:33.540 --> 56:35.860]  100% always take responsibility
[56:35.860 --> 56:37.860]  for your mess-ups.
[56:38.220 --> 56:41.580]  You gotta have someone who always takes
[56:41.580 --> 56:43.400]  responsibility and someone who doesn't take it at all.
[56:43.900 --> 56:45.860]  You gotta balance out.
[56:46.980 --> 56:47.320]  Oh!
[56:48.660 --> 56:49.440]  Who said that?
[56:50.620 --> 56:51.020]  Fuck!
[56:52.560 --> 56:53.140]  I'm falling back.
[56:53.400 --> 56:53.740]  Yeah.
[56:58.750 --> 56:59.910]  Okay, that's coming back.
[57:00.890 --> 57:02.130]  I need to start pulling more.
[57:03.010 --> 57:04.250]  Yes. I have a weird thing
[57:04.250 --> 57:06.170]  in this game where I feel like that's rude, so I
[57:06.170 --> 57:08.150]  don't do it. I know I can,
[57:08.330 --> 57:09.970]  but like... Get it out!
[57:12.690 --> 57:13.090]  Okay.
[57:14.910 --> 57:15.830]  Work our way back.
[57:16.370 --> 57:17.810]  We got it! There's plenty of time.
[57:17.810 --> 57:18.170]  Got it.
[57:21.720 --> 57:22.860]  Bicycle kick on that one.
[57:23.200 --> 57:23.740]  There you go.
[57:26.900 --> 57:28.660]  Be a little bit more aggressive, I guess.
[57:29.300 --> 57:29.500]  Yeah.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.200]  Well that, hey!
[57:34.040 --> 57:35.100]  That might be the
[57:35.100 --> 57:36.040]  recipe we need.
[57:37.660 --> 57:39.060]  Aggressive? Yeah, just
[57:39.060 --> 57:39.900]  all out.
[57:41.400 --> 57:42.720]  It's such a bad feeling
[57:42.720 --> 57:45.140]  for where that guy is. I've been there so
[57:45.140 --> 57:47.140]  many times of like, you're in net and
[57:47.140 --> 57:48.080]  you do nothing.
[57:48.520 --> 57:51.240]  You're like, you freeze up because
[57:51.240 --> 57:53.020]  you're like, I don't know what the best move here is.
[57:53.080 --> 57:54.340]  I'm in a bad spot.
[57:57.950 --> 57:59.150]  Well, I hit him.
[58:01.010 --> 58:01.690]  Oh no.
[58:02.530 --> 58:03.210]  We're alright.
[58:04.810 --> 58:08.470]  Oh! Come on!
[58:08.850 --> 58:09.350]  It's wide.
[58:11.410 --> 58:11.970]  Shit!
[58:12.690 --> 58:13.290]  We're okay.
[58:13.850 --> 58:14.710]  Got him. Nice.
[58:17.150 --> 58:19.250]  Oh, I'm gonna fall back for a second here.
[58:22.430 --> 58:23.310]  Alright, got that.
[58:23.630 --> 58:24.970]  Nick! Good save!
[58:24.970 --> 58:27.310]  Again, I just happened to be at the right spot at the right time.
[58:27.430 --> 58:28.210]  Didn't follow it properly.
[58:30.910 --> 58:33.490]  Oh damn it, Nick. What are you doing?
[58:34.570 --> 58:34.930]  Ah!
[58:35.130 --> 58:36.670]  Shit. Wall. Shit.
[58:38.590 --> 58:39.070]  Okay.
[58:41.850 --> 58:43.150]  Give that a follow if you can.
[58:43.190 --> 58:43.590]  There you go.
[58:45.170 --> 58:45.370]  Yeah.
[58:46.490 --> 58:46.950]  Aggressive.
[58:48.470 --> 58:49.530]  Oh, come on.
[58:51.370 --> 58:51.830]  Nice.
[58:52.210 --> 58:53.850]  It's still there. It's still in play.
[58:54.590 --> 58:55.150]  Damn it.
[58:57.230 --> 58:59.030]  I was trying to bounce it
[58:59.030 --> 58:59.730]  off that wall.
[59:00.590 --> 59:00.770]  Oh!
[59:02.850 --> 59:04.190]  Master of the universe!
[59:07.110 --> 59:07.550]  Oh!
[59:07.890 --> 59:09.030]  Oh, there it goes. There it goes.
[59:09.790 --> 59:13.230]  Oh, I'm with you.
[59:13.550 --> 59:13.950]  I'm with you.
[59:14.050 --> 59:15.450]  I blew that.
[59:16.370 --> 59:17.470]  Ah, that little bastard.
[59:19.470 --> 59:19.910]  Fuck.
[59:20.130 --> 59:20.910]  Bad timing.
[59:21.510 --> 59:22.010]  Let's see.
[59:26.700 --> 59:28.200]  Let's see. We'll keep it over here.
[59:28.400 --> 59:28.620]  Yep.
[59:29.380 --> 59:30.400]  Got it up there.
[59:31.920 --> 59:32.360]  Fuck!
[59:32.820 --> 59:33.540]  Good try.
[59:35.500 --> 59:36.160]  Hit that.
[59:36.340 --> 59:36.900]  It's going center.
[59:37.720 --> 59:37.920]  Shit.
[59:39.400 --> 59:40.600]  That took a weird angle.
[59:43.240 --> 59:44.060]  Ah, damn.
[59:44.480 --> 59:46.080]  I was hoping I'd beat him to it. I did not.
[59:46.440 --> 59:47.360]  Oh, shit.
[59:47.820 --> 59:48.220]  Things are bad.
[59:48.880 --> 59:51.420]  Yeah, not great.
[59:52.460 --> 59:52.680]  Yeah.
[59:53.560 --> 59:54.460]  Almost had it.
[59:54.860 --> 59:55.560]  That was a good try.
[59:58.120 --> 59:59.880]  That's alright. We still have time.
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.280]  We're glad you could catch a stream live, Nick something.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:03.520]  Yeah!
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.800]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.620]  This is fun.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.720]  We're having a good time.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.020]  We're having an intense time.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:11.820]  We are.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.060]  If you got a play on this, go for it.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:16.780]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.620]  Okay, he's coming up.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.320]  Alright.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.420]  There we go.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.520]  There's a lot of shit happening right there.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.820]  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:40.380]  I think you've carried me as far as you can, Nick.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.420]  I think we've hit the wall.
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:43.480]  We're okay.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.060]  A couple of losses is what, you know.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.260]  But we've got to finish strong.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.500]  We've got two left after this.
[01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:52.750]  Okay.
[01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:54.650]  Let's just try being aggressive for a minute.
[01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.270]  Oh.
[01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:58.110]  Alright, well.
[01:00:58.830 --> 01:00:59.930]  All but the next game.
[01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:01.130]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:04.250]  Okay.
[01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:06.310]  I thought they were going to do what we did to that other team.
[01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.670]  Yeah.
[01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:09.570]  Well, karma's a bitch.
[01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:12.710]  Oh my god.
[01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:13.590]  Thank you so much.
[01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:15.410]  First time chat and for the bits.
[01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.950]  Oh, thank y'all.
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:19.350]  Thank you to everybody we missed.
[01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:22.390]  Seriously, for any subs and bits.
[01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:24.150]  I'm sorry we didn't see it.
[01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.350]  We appreciate it so much.
[01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:28.850]  It is hard to read
[01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:29.690]  when you're flying.
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.450]  Yeah, having a third
[01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.070]  would be really nice right now, but
[01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.810]  just know that you are super appreciated
[01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:37.650]  and
[01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.750]  yeah, just thank you for being here so much.
[01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:44.250]  And if you're watching this later, let us know if you
[01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:46.570]  enjoy a little bit more
[01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:47.430]  of a competitive
[01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:50.630]  game.
[01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:52.510]  Me too, man.
[01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.750]  I'm sometimes
[01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:57.010]  not good at it, but I like it.
[01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.890]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.770]  I've given up on ever being elite at anything
[01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:03.710]  like that, but
[01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.970]  I do enjoy feeling like the stakes are a little bit
[01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:07.210]  higher.
[01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.590]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.310]  A little bit more of stuff
[01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:15.490]  on the line kind of thing.
[01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.550]  My brain just did the dumb Homer Simpson joke
[01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:20.310]  of, mmm, stakes.
[01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.550]  Nice, Nick.
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:24.110]  Mmm, stakes.
[01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.810]  Oh, they just did you once again.
[01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:29.290]  That was... Nick!
[01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:32.690]  You're crisscrossing them. They didn't know what to do.
[01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:33.950]  That was amazing.
[01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.250]  I'm a net. Thanks, man.
[01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:38.250]  Alright, I'll go. Here we go.
[01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.170]  Yeah.
[01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:44.110]  I...
[01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:46.390]  tried to do something there
[01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:47.830]  that didn't work. Ooh, ooh!
[01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.550]  That's a nice hit. Follow that. Follow that. Follow that.
[01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.150]  Oh, I should've. I'm sorry. I immediately went for boost.
[01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.550]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:54.730]  Okay.
[01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:56.070]  Ah.
[01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:01.870]  Yeah, if you ever, like, have any direction
[01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:03.970]  to follow it or whatever, always feel free to say it.
[01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.410]  I do not mind in the slightest. Oopsie.
[01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.130]  I appreciate it. Oh.
[01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:09.750]  I appreciate it, because I just... I'm driving
[01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.610]  around. I don't have a lot of thought in this game, typically.
[01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:13.950]  I do not have the strategy
[01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:15.870]  or, like, the feel of what I
[01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.130]  should push as opposed to
[01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:19.270]  being very defensive.
[01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.670]  You will be wrong sometimes.
[01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:22.570]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:27.870]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay, well...
[01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:29.110]  Ah!
[01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:31.770]  At least they're
[01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:32.770]  both in a bad spot.
[01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:35.630]  That's true. Paul was in the perfect spot.
[01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.610]  Everybody was awkwardly placed.
[01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:39.150]  Oh, that's you. Yep. Hitting it down.
[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:41.690]  Alright, you stay left.
[01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:42.990]  I'm gonna see if I can set you.
[01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:44.990]  Oh, that was a...
[01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:47.590]  I bounced it.
[01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:48.610]  It's all I could do.
[01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:50.590]  I know. Ah!
[01:03:50.810 --> 01:03:51.750]  Ah, good try.
[01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:54.910]  Flew up like a rocket.
[01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:55.750]  You almost hit it.
[01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:59.010]  All I can do is make it an aerial.
[01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:00.910]  And I was like,
[01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:01.150]  wee!
[01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:06.230]  Okay. Alright.
[01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:07.230]  You go.
[01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:10.290]  Here we go.
[01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:11.650]  That was terrible.
[01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:14.130]  That's alright. Wide.
[01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:15.590]  I'm back.
[01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.770]  Alright.
[01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.270]  We've killed two men so far
[01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:22.730]  in this game.
[01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:26.030]  Oh, shit! Me killing him almost
[01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.210]  actually just set him up perfectly for that.
[01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:29.970]  That does happen a lot.
[01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:31.070]  Ah!
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:32.950]  Now they're killing you.
[01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:35.410]  The blood has been shed.
[01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:38.330]  The piece is broken,
[01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:38.890]  my friend.
[01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.550]  If you can set that.
[01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:43.450]  That's a little too hard.
[01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.370]  A little too hard.
[01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:47.570]  Nice!
[01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.730]  That was a beautiful little tippy-tap.
[01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:51.270]  Little tippy-tap!
[01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:53.030]  Little tippy-tap!
[01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:55.690]  Getting the boost.
[01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:56.630]  Falling back.
[01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:00.090]  Nice.
[01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:00.670]  There we go.
[01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.170]  He's gotten past me.
[01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:05.470]  You're alright.
[01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:06.670]  Oh, nice!
[01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.670]  Oh, shit!
[01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:10.410]  If you can...
[01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:10.930]  Yeah!
[01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.730]  You saved the farm, Andrew.
[01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:17.150]  And you set me perfectly.
[01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:18.010]  Yeah!
[01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:21.110]  What a goal!
[01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:23.170]  Nicely done, Andrew.
[01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:24.230]  Great teamwork, man.
[01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:27.050]  2-1. We can just hold this.
[01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.930]  Lock it up.
[01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:30.230]  We can hold.
[01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.930]  What a time.
[01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:34.290]  I'm dropping.
[01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:36.630]  Alright, I'm going.
[01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.470]  Nice.
[01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:40.290]  I'm terrified.
[01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:41.950]  I'm just going to keep holding that.
[01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:43.750]  I'm very scared.
[01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:47.190]  Okay, there we go.
[01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:48.950]  There we go.
[01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:49.750]  Now this is better.
[01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:50.890]  I like it over there.
[01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:54.210]  Oh.
[01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:56.810]  Land.
[01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:57.230]  Okay.
[01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:01.190]  Oh, that was great.
[01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.130]  Way to recover.
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.630]  Alright, let's get this shit out of here.
[01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:19.230]  There you go.
[01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:22.310]  Oh!
[01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:25.270]  Damn! That was really good.
[01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:27.490]  No, you son of a...
[01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:27.750]  Oh.
[01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:30.610]  No! He knew!
[01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:31.350]  He knew!
[01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:34.850]  Too much speed!
[01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.890]  Yeah!
[01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.230]  Not for you, but for your partner.
[01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:39.070]  Oh, shit!
[01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:41.630]  Nice!
[01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.610]  Just get out of here!
[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.730]  We need a win. We haven't won in a little bit.
[01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.570]  We need this.
[01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.270]  It's been a couple games.
[01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.930]  Yeah!
[01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:54.410]  Oh!
[01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:55.270]  I want it!
[01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:56.490]  No! It's wide!
[01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:57.570]  No!
[01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.790]  It just hit the top!
[01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:03.650]  I had to go fast to beat him to it.
[01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:04.170]  Oh, no!
[01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:06.350]  Oh, no!
[01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:08.290]  Ah!
[01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:10.770]  Clear.
[01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:12.330]  Okay, I'm back.
[01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:15.130]  I don't know what I'm doing!
[01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:17.990]  Oh, shit! I'm out of boost!
[01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:18.590]  No!
[01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:19.410]  No!
[01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.410]  Oh, no!
[01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:24.810]  Oh, no!
[01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:25.870]  I got frozen.
[01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.870]  Oh, shit!
[01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:27.790]  You go.
[01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.590]  I'm going to follow right behind you.
[01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:32.210]  Oh, shit! It didn't work!
[01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:35.490]  They launched it to the moon!
[01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:37.410]  Oh, balls.
[01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.970]  They launched it to the moon!
[01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.410]  But you did, too!
[01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:41.710]  Fly me to the moon!
[01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.410]  Get in! Cross it!
[01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:45.970]  Ah, damn it! I missed.
[01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:48.270]  There you go!
[01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:49.310]  Uh-oh.
[01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:54.150]  I don't know what I was doing.
[01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.430]  I should have repositioned during that.
[01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:57.750]  Instead of being like, I'm going to get a bicycle kick on this.
[01:07:57.850 --> 01:07:58.690]  Go wide! Yes!
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:04.450]  I thought that was way wider than it was!
[01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:05.610]  So I just was watching!
[01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:07.130]  And it hit me!
[01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.070]  Push it, Andrew! Push!
[01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:09.130]  I'm pushing it!
[01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:11.970]  Oh, shit!
[01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.530]  No!
[01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.230]  Okay, we're in overtime.
[01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:17.590]  Okay, that's alright.
[01:08:18.570 --> 01:08:19.950]  I'm getting sweaty. You go.
[01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:20.710]  I'm going!
[01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:23.990]  Okay, nice.
[01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.170]  Oh, drop!
[01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.850]  No, it's fine. We got this.
[01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:32.710]  It's all good.
[01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.910]  Alright, you go.
[01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.950]  Oh, that might drop.
[01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:42.530]  That would have been complete luck if that went in.
[01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.890]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:45.610]  I got it.
[01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:46.470]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.230]  Oh, they fucked each other.
[01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:52.530]  I couldn't explain that better.
[01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:53.470]  They screwed up.
[01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:56.010]  They screwed each other.
[01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:56.310]  What?
[01:08:57.790 --> 01:08:58.930]  It's the same thing, but different.
[01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.470]  There you go, maybe.
[01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:04.550]  Oh, my God.
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:04.950]  We're okay.
[01:09:06.190 --> 01:09:07.830]  Oh, bad.
[01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:08.330]  Bad, bad, bad.
[01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:11.890]  Okay.
[01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:14.850]  I'm going to follow if I can.
[01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:15.910]  Oh, no!
[01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:18.310]  Okay.
[01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.990]  Go, Nick!
[01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.790]  Oh, it's...
[01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.470]  Oh, this is intense.
[01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:28.830]  Alright, here we go.
[01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:31.110]  Oh, shit!
[01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.830]  Oh!
[01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:33.410]  Oh!
[01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.830]  Oh!
[01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.310]  Oh!
[01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:38.410]  Go for it, Andrew.
[01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:39.650]  Yeah, I'm trying.
[01:09:41.650 --> 01:09:42.590]  Oh, no.
[01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:43.830]  I misplayed that totally.
[01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:45.670]  I don't want to hear that.
[01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.890]  It's okay.
[01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:50.410]  Yeah!
[01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:52.010]  Yes!
[01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:54.550]  I just danced it on top.
[01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:56.010]  Yeah, buddy!
[01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:58.630]  Oh, we got one more.
[01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:01.630]  The last game.
[01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:01.910]  One more.
[01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.770]  One more.
[01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:05.650]  Traitor.
[01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:09.230]  Did I hit you?
[01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.890]  Did I kill you?
[01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:13.290]  I don't know.
[01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:14.090]  It's a traitor.
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:15.230]  I don't know.
[01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:19.450]  Maybe whatever you did, you were the last one to touch it before it rolled into our goal somehow.
[01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:21.250]  I guess there's two.
[01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.890]  So, I'm nine to ten on one tier,
[01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:25.570]  but then I'm six to ten on another.
[01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.690]  Okay.
[01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:28.110]  Whatever.
[01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:30.310]  We're getting one rank for sure,
[01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.310]  and I'm certain we'll come back and do more of this
[01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:33.070]  within the season.
[01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:34.810]  This is fun.
[01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:36.230]  This is very fun.
[01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:37.750]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.830]  Yeah.
[01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:40.670]  Yeah.
[01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:43.890]  Ooh!
[01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:48.570]  This feels very...
[01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:49.270]  Okay, last game.
[01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:50.550]  Jerry Jones.
[01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:53.370]  The big finale.
[01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:58.810]  The big finale.
[01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:00.890]  The big finale.
[01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:01.010]  Ooh.
[01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.750]  I think they might be good.
[01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:04.590]  Yep, they're good.
[01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:06.930]  Oh, I was also being stupid,
[01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.550]  so I need to not do that.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.760]  You have so much room to be dumb, it's fine.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.700]  If you get screwed up 25 times in a row,
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.120]  you're fine.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.940]  No problem.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.640]  We had somebody call out that they think you're going to be gold two.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:24.800]  Oh.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.360]  Yeah, so it goes...
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.140]  I don't know if there's anything lower than silver.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.320]  There's like silver one through four.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.080]  Oh, God.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.180]  Okay, this is...
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.600]  I got bullied, and then...
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.280]  I just didn't know what to do.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.380]  Oh, yeah, you sure did.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.180]  Okay.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.480]  We got this. You go, I'll follow.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:45.820]  Okay.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.420]  Oh, bronze exists. Okay. Oh, yeah, there is bronze. Okay.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.880]  I don't know why I didn't think that would exist.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.340]  I just don't know that I've been there.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.420]  It's not a...
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.480]  It did sound like a humble brag.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.880]  I know a shortcut.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.240]  You want to know about bronze?
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:02.420]  I'll tell you all about bronze.
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.340]  If you got that, go for it.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.980]  Oh, there you go.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.080]  Frosted, but...
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.000]  Wasn't very accurate.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.080]  That's going center.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.520]  That's going to get hit.
[01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:22.810]  Alright.
[01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:24.870]  Shit. Nice. Good save.
[01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:27.090]  Good save.
[01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.830]  Nick!
[01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.890]  Yeah, they're on me, though.
[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:30.990]  Yeah, good try, though.
[01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:35.170]  It was also the slowest fast break in the world.
[01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:37.910]  I fucking...
[01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:39.590]  whiffed that so hard.
[01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:41.110]  I whiffed that so hard.
[01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:42.130]  This is all my fault.
[01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.030]  Whatever happens here...
[01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:46.110]  Push it.
[01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:47.190]  Fuck.
[01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.910]  Nick!
[01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:52.910]  With the one-twos!
[01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:57.630]  That was the slowest developing play.
[01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:59.370]  I felt like Kyle Anderson
[01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:00.230]  from the Timberwolves.
[01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:01.210]  Where's the play now?
[01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:04.530]  One way.
[01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:06.390]  Tie it up.
[01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.770]  Alright, you go.
[01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:09.950]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:11.830]  Let's see what we got here.
[01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:13.030]  I'm holding back.
[01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:15.570]  No!
[01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:18.930]  I'm so sorry!
[01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:21.270]  I'm so sorry!
[01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:24.250]  No!
[01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:27.370]  Oh!
[01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.270]  Oh!
[01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.890]  It's okay.
[01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:30.450]  Oh!
[01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:33.230]  Oh!
[01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:35.650]  Oh, Nick!
[01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:37.830]  Make a...
[01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.810]  No! The weakest tap!
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:40.690]  You got it!
[01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:42.650]  Holy shit, it worked!
[01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.490]  Oh, man.
[01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:48.630]  Okay, well, that's two goals for you
[01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:50.630]  and one goal for me. We're doing great.
[01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:52.470]  Hey, you got the
[01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:53.650]  trader rank, though. That's good.
[01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:56.210]  That's gonna be great for my rank.
[01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:57.050]  Ooh.
[01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:00.590]  Nick!
[01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:01.150]  Yeah!
[01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:06.550]  I don't think
[01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:08.330]  I've ever seen you be this good
[01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:10.790]  at any game ever, and it's such a delight to watch.
[01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:11.730]  Oh!
[01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.350]  You're killing it, man. Great job.
[01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:16.370]  Well, it's better to be
[01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:18.450]  lucky than good, man. Oh, here we go.
[01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.570]  Oh, yeah!
[01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.150]  Nice follow. Ooh!
[01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:23.950]  Wish I had some boosts.
[01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:25.190]  Alright.
[01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:27.090]  Let's see.
[01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:29.950]  Oh, missed it. If you got any...
[01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:31.250]  Ooh, that's nice.
[01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:32.750]  That's something, I don't know.
[01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:35.870]  Nice job! Okay.
[01:14:36.650 --> 01:14:37.410]  Keep it over here.
[01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:40.570]  Oh, Andrew, if you got it!
[01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:42.470]  Ah, I didn't have the boost.
[01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.930]  Ah, it's all good.
[01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:46.330]  I'm supposed to get through.
[01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:47.890]  Here we go! Oh!
[01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:50.630]  Okay, that might take
[01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:52.270]  a double bounce. You might need to...
[01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:54.070]  Yeah, yeah. Oh, no!
[01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:56.730]  Oh, I just missed it!
[01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:57.690]  Damn it!
[01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:00.410]  Oh, that's a try.
[01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:02.610]  That was an insane
[01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:03.750]  shot set up by them.
[01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:06.630]  I just
[01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:08.250]  missed that. Yeah, that was...
[01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.570]  They did such a good job on that one.
[01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:11.590]  Alright, you follow me.
[01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:11.870]  I'll go.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.600]  Is that a Tesla
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.600]  truck this dude's driving? I think so, yeah.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.760]  Does it rust?
[01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:30.090]  Nice!
[01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:34.770]  I'm not gonna get
[01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:35.730]  that from here.
[01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:37.110]  Nice.
[01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:40.970]  Oh, good job, Nick.
[01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.330]  Get out of the way, prick!
[01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:46.290]  Is that
[01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:47.410]  coming your way, maybe? Yep.
[01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.630]  Oh!
[01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.350]  Nice! What a play!
[01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.290]  Holy shit, we're back. 4-4.
[01:15:56.670 --> 01:15:58.210]  Oh my god, I'm
[01:15:58.210 --> 01:15:59.350]  so tired.
[01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:02.490]  What a
[01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:03.510]  way to end this.
[01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.950]  It's so hot in here, dude.
[01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:07.650]  It is so hot in my office.
[01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:09.850]  Okay.
[01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:13.470]  Oh, he beat me to it!
[01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:15.330]  Okay.
[01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:17.510]  Oh, no easy shit, no easy shit,
[01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:19.150]  no easy shit, no easy shit, oh shit!
[01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:20.710]  Oh no, Andrew!
[01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:23.670]  I'm so
[01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:24.350]  sorry!
[01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:27.630]  I don't know,
[01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:29.230]  I don't know what's happening to me.
[01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:32.670]  I don't know.
[01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:37.430]  It's okay, we got it, we got it, we got it.
[01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.170]  You said no easy shit, and I went
[01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:40.790]  easy shit, you got it.
[01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:42.830]  I'm gonna score for them. Copy
[01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:43.230]  that.
[01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:49.970]  Oh, I'm
[01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:51.590]  sorry! No! Oh, wait.
[01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:54.110]  Oh no, I got hit into that.
[01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:55.710]  I'm gonna let you know that.
[01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:56.970]  I'm crossing, I'm crossing, I'm crossing.
[01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:58.070]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:01.390]  Yeah! Beautiful cross.
[01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.870]  We're just scoring goals left and right, we're
[01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:05.990]  scoring for our team, we're scoring for their
[01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:07.870]  team, we're just getting goals on the
[01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:08.210]  board.
[01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.950]  Left and right. What a great setup.
[01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:13.670]  Alright,
[01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.010]  this is you Andrew, you go.
[01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.150]  Go on, go on.
[01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:26.030]  I hit the moon. Oh, nice!
[01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:27.050]  Tried.
[01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:29.990]  It was beautiful. I'm back to get boost.
[01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:32.950]  Okay, I cut it off.
[01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:35.710]  I'm gonna get more boost myself. Fuck!
[01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.830]  Oh, shit!
[01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:40.850]  Mmm...
[01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:41.710]  No, not doing that.
[01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:43.590]  Oh, interesting
[01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:44.330]  development.
[01:17:48.810 --> 01:17:49.070]  Oh!
[01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:56.610]  Nice, nice, nice.
[01:17:57.810 --> 01:17:58.490]  Oh, nice!
[01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:01.290]  Oh, damn. Okay, I'm gonna see if I can
[01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:02.750]  set you. Oh, that little bastard.
[01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:06.710]  Fuck! Oh, shit!
[01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:09.310]  Okay, this got
[01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.370]  really intense. Chat,
[01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:11.610]  everybody,
[01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:14.130]  breathe easy. Remember to breathe.
[01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:16.430]  He said it himself.
[01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:18.490]  Remember to breathe. What if I don't want to breathe?
[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:20.410]  I can't
[01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:20.710]  breathe!
[01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:23.850]  I can't breathe!
[01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:24.850]  Oh, Andrew!
[01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:26.650]  Oh, no!
[01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.450]  No!
[01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:31.410]  Oh, oh, oh!
[01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:33.370]  Oh, yes!
[01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:35.370]  Alright, I'm gonna get a boost.
[01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:37.430]  And everybody's just gonna chill out.
[01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:38.190]  Fuck him!
[01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:40.670]  Here we go.
[01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:42.250]  No!
[01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:45.330]  Oh, Andrew. Oh,
[01:18:45.370 --> 01:18:46.950]  balls. Oh,

[01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:51.390]  okay. Go, go, go!
[01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:53.890]  Andrew, I'm gonna set you.
[01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:54.290]  Cross!
[01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.850]  Oh!
[01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:59.490]  Oh, okay, here we go.
[01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:00.210]  Here we go, baby.
[01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:01.810]  I'm a net, I'm a net.
[01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:04.250]  I'm a net, I'm a net, I'm a net.
[01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:05.330]  I'm a net, I'm a net, I'm a net, I'm a net.
[01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:06.490]  What is this all, folks?
[01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:08.050]  No!
[01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:10.210]  Get out of here!
[01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:11.170]  Nice!
[01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:14.990]  Oh!
[01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:17.470]  The camera's swinging, the camera's swinging!
[01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:18.770]  No!
[01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:21.070]  No!
[01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:23.510]  Oh, Andrew, push!
[01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.330]  Bah!
[01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:26.570]  Oh, no!
[01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:29.630]  I slowed it down too much. Here we go!
[01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:32.110]  Are you?
[01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:33.250]  No!
[01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:34.590]  No!
[01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:36.150]  No!
[01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.970]  Oh, no!
[01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:40.630]  No!
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.960]  I scored all the goals that shouldn't have happened and missed all the ones that should.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.020]  That was all you.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.440]  Okay, what's my rank?
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.460]  Oh, man.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:54.740]  GG.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:56.600]  Did my best.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.740]  You did a good job. Let's see what you got.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:00.840]  Alright, you're gold two.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.880]  I'm gold two.
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:03.820]  Does it say what division you are?
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.720]  Division five? Four?
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:06.900]  Four!
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:09.340]  Oh!
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.400]  What a game!
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.120]  What a series of games.
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:18.340]  Nick, thank you so much for joining me
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.300]  in this ridiculous friendly stream.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.680]  Thank you for not also being on vacation
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.880]  on this wonderful Friday.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.400]  Thank you to
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.060]  the chat for watching.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.640]  This has been so much fun.
