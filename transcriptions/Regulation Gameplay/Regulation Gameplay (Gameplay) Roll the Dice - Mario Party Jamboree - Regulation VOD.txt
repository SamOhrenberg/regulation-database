[00:00.000 --> 00:02.580]  Have you ever thrown a grenade in real life, Gav? Like a live grenade?
[00:03.380 --> 00:03.640]  No.
[00:03.940 --> 00:04.600]  Well, not a real one.
[00:05.080 --> 00:05.300]  Yeah.
[00:06.680 --> 00:08.640]  Why the fuck would I want to use a Joy-Con?
[00:08.960 --> 00:09.080]  Jeez.
[00:09.400 --> 00:10.820]  I mean, Gavin could have just hit no.
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.840]  He said yes, because I know it.
[00:13.240 --> 00:16.260]  There are motion games, you gotta get the full... yeah, I'm with Gavin.
[00:17.680 --> 00:18.260]  Thanks, Andrew.
[00:19.220 --> 00:20.880]  Oh, I'm not fooling against any of it.
[00:21.660 --> 00:23.040]  You seem like you have an opinion, though.
[00:24.460 --> 00:25.620]  No, I just like what happened.
[00:27.500 --> 00:29.660]  It's just confusing, because...
[00:29.660 --> 00:33.160]  The Joy-Con is like A, but it's actually the X that is now the A.
[00:33.380 --> 00:34.140]  Just do 10 turns.
[00:34.480 --> 00:37.040]  Why would you do 15? Just do 10 turns.
[00:37.880 --> 00:38.840]  Oh, man.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.020]  Just do 10 turns.
[00:40.780 --> 00:41.780]  That's gonna be a lot of...
[00:41.780 --> 00:43.540]  Think of all the corn cats you'll get out of this.
[00:43.760 --> 00:44.720]  I don't want any!
[00:45.580 --> 00:46.640]  You love those.
[00:47.240 --> 00:48.880]  10 turns ain't enough time for anything to happen.
[00:49.040 --> 00:50.140]  Just hit start.
[00:50.480 --> 00:52.140]  Hit start? God damn, let's just do it.
[00:52.260 --> 00:53.040]  Let's lock in.
[00:54.060 --> 00:55.460]  Play this stupid fucking game.
[00:55.580 --> 00:55.980]  We're ready to start.
[00:58.260 --> 01:01.580]  I would have hit start earlier, but Eric was giving it all this in my ear.
[01:02.440 --> 01:04.300]  Well, I was also gone, but...
[01:04.300 --> 01:05.180]  You're gonna get a voice from me.
[01:09.800 --> 01:11.220]  We're going to the Gallerias?
[01:11.520 --> 01:12.020]  It's like Los Angeles.
[01:12.020 --> 01:12.780]  We're going to the mall!
[01:13.360 --> 01:14.120]  We gotta get to 601!
[01:15.660 --> 01:16.400]  Oh, my God.
[01:18.800 --> 01:20.660]  I got a World Series to watch tonight.
[01:21.040 --> 01:22.780]  Oh, is it at 6 o'clock?
[01:22.980 --> 01:24.700]  I think it's at 7. You can come over if you want to.
[01:25.300 --> 01:26.840]  Hey, pick up the boy late!
[01:28.980 --> 01:29.400]  What?
[01:29.580 --> 01:29.780]  You can wait.
[01:30.520 --> 01:31.860]  I told my wife to pick the boy up late.
[01:32.240 --> 01:34.160]  You yelled at your wife to pick up the boy late?
[01:34.820 --> 01:35.340]  The boy.
[01:35.600 --> 01:36.280]  Are you Kratos?
[01:38.400 --> 01:38.820]  Yes.
[01:40.980 --> 01:41.760]  To some.
[01:42.700 --> 01:44.240]  I like that you...
[01:44.240 --> 01:44.680]  Oh, here we go.
[01:44.840 --> 01:45.240]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[01:45.600 --> 01:46.160]  Oh, shit!
[01:46.880 --> 01:47.120]  Yeah!
[01:48.040 --> 01:48.280]  Yeah!
[01:48.280 --> 01:48.760]  Donkey Kong!
[01:48.840 --> 01:49.180]  Yeah!
[01:49.620 --> 01:50.700]  It's Nick's pin.
[01:56.860 --> 01:58.060]  Give me them coins.
[01:58.360 --> 01:59.220]  Hold on.
[02:00.180 --> 02:03.520]  I have to go ahead and blur that out.
[02:07.660 --> 02:10.580]  Oh, it's up for a test, son. It's over by the Jamba Juice.
[02:10.960 --> 02:11.180]  Yep.
[02:11.780 --> 02:13.660]  Dude, Geoff, why is Gus texting us?
[02:14.540 --> 02:15.520]  Why? Is he right now?
[02:15.640 --> 02:16.260]  Oh, no.
[02:16.640 --> 02:17.460]  That can't be good.
[02:17.820 --> 02:19.620]  He's got to be disgruntled about something.
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.980]  Did you book an AdMob for right now?
[02:23.440 --> 02:24.120]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24.380 --> 02:24.680]  We are going to be texting Gus right now.
[02:24.680 --> 02:26.440]  I already did it today. I already took my medicine.
[02:28.140 --> 02:29.760]  Oh, DK's up first.
[02:30.360 --> 02:31.740]  I had such a fucking...
[02:31.740 --> 02:32.020]  Dude.
[02:32.380 --> 02:34.160]  I had such a Gus conversation with him.
[02:34.520 --> 02:36.280]  Well, I don't feel bad sharing this.
[02:36.540 --> 02:37.280]  I think it's okay to share.
[02:38.580 --> 02:47.580]  I said, hey, I think it would be fun to look back over the history of Rooster Teeth as eras tied to offices.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.580]  And I was kind of sentimental about a certain moment that happened at a certain office.
[02:51.580 --> 02:54.460]  And I decided that it was my favorite period of time.
[02:54.460 --> 02:55.060]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[02:55.080 --> 02:55.820]  Oh, that's cool.
[02:56.560 --> 02:58.580]  And I said, what was your favorite period of time, Gus?
[02:58.660 --> 03:01.360]  And he goes, I look at it in kind of the opposite way.
[03:01.460 --> 03:04.440]  I look at which era was the most annoying for me.
[03:04.620 --> 03:06.500]  And these are why I hate each one.
[03:06.580 --> 03:09.780]  And I was like, never fucking mind, man.
[03:10.000 --> 03:11.120]  Jesus Christ.
[03:11.300 --> 03:12.680]  It was so funny.
[03:13.660 --> 03:13.980]  Dude.
[03:14.120 --> 03:14.540]  I love that.
[03:14.540 --> 03:15.420]  It was awesome.
[03:15.700 --> 03:17.320]  It was so Gus.
[03:17.660 --> 03:18.780]  Everything about it was so Gus.
[03:18.780 --> 03:19.680]  Oh, God.
[03:19.700 --> 03:23.460]  He's just like the most glass half empty person.
[03:23.460 --> 03:24.940]  Yeah, everything about it.
[03:24.940 --> 03:26.100]  It was the best.
[03:26.460 --> 03:26.800]  It was the best.
[03:26.800 --> 03:28.340]  Oh, you can't go up the down escalator?
[03:28.420 --> 03:29.080]  That sucks.
[03:29.460 --> 03:30.780]  You can try, but you might get stuck.
[03:31.560 --> 03:31.720]  Yeah.
[03:34.480 --> 03:35.460]  Punch it, Chow.
[03:37.520 --> 03:38.100]  Good one.
[03:39.260 --> 03:40.420]  Oh, is that a lucky space?
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.140]  Give it.
[03:42.720 --> 03:43.700]  What's so lucky about...
[03:43.700 --> 03:44.300]  Oh, shit.
[03:44.920 --> 03:46.200]  Oh, what is this?
[03:47.040 --> 03:47.480]  Oh, shit.
[03:47.480 --> 03:48.040]  It's a pipe.
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.900]  Hey, it cracks back on the board.
[03:51.480 --> 03:52.280]  Oh, wow.
[03:52.280 --> 03:53.760]  I'll aimlessly go somewhere.
[03:54.140 --> 03:55.820]  You're going to like a pop-up store.
[03:57.800 --> 03:59.520]  Oh, I wonder if it's a collab.
[04:00.460 --> 04:02.600]  Yeah, it's a Hello Kitty.
[04:03.260 --> 04:04.220]  Gucci x Mario.
[04:04.740 --> 04:05.040]  Yeah.
[04:06.740 --> 04:07.300]  Nice.
[04:07.480 --> 04:07.600]  Hey, bud.
[04:11.060 --> 04:11.620]  Yay.
[04:13.160 --> 04:14.940]  Guys, this is the last time I'm leaving.
[04:16.380 --> 04:19.860]  You snort those coins right up your nose like coin cane.
[04:22.280 --> 04:23.720]  Oh, God, I popped my ear.
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.320]  You went coin cane instead of Co-Coin?
[04:25.660 --> 04:27.100]  Co-Coin is where I was going.
[04:27.400 --> 04:27.920]  Co-Coin is way better.
[04:28.420 --> 04:28.960]  Way better.
[04:29.280 --> 04:31.380]  I came up with it in the second.
[04:31.620 --> 04:32.660]  I wasn't premeditated.
[04:33.760 --> 04:35.600]  Co-Coin is so much better.
[04:36.060 --> 04:37.180]  You said it and I went, huh?
[04:38.060 --> 04:39.260]  Find a unique image.
[04:40.200 --> 04:40.580]  Okay.
[04:42.200 --> 04:43.080]  Higher scores.
[04:44.800 --> 04:45.400]  You got this.
[04:45.460 --> 04:45.920]  Just hit start.
[04:46.020 --> 04:46.320]  You're fine.
[04:47.100 --> 04:47.640]  Oh, shit.
[04:47.880 --> 04:48.140]  Okay.
[04:48.380 --> 04:49.260]  I don't know what we're doing.
[04:49.260 --> 04:50.840]  Let's find a unique image.
[04:50.960 --> 04:53.960]  You want to pick the odd one out.
[04:54.340 --> 04:54.840]  Oh, okay.
[04:55.520 --> 04:56.160]  Yeah, easy.
[04:56.520 --> 04:57.620]  Just hit start.
[04:58.840 --> 05:00.320]  How the fuck do I do that on this?
[05:00.560 --> 05:00.700]  Okay.
[05:02.560 --> 05:04.040]  I'm telling you the Joy-Con sucks.
[05:04.040 --> 05:07.020]  It's a little sliver of a fucking part of a controller.
[05:07.560 --> 05:08.520]  Okay, you gotta guess.
[05:08.540 --> 05:09.140]  Which one is it?
[05:09.580 --> 05:11.060]  It's a little stick of gum controller.
[05:11.140 --> 05:12.460]  Oh, God damn it.
[05:12.520 --> 05:13.700]  Way to go, Mario.
[05:14.320 --> 05:15.080]  Hell yeah.
[05:15.700 --> 05:17.600]  Nick was unintentionally right.
[05:17.780 --> 05:18.680]  Nick was right.
[05:18.680 --> 05:19.200]  What?
[05:21.860 --> 05:23.140]  Nick was right.
[05:23.900 --> 05:25.300]  I'm always right, baby.
[05:26.260 --> 05:27.680]  Listen to that confidence.
[05:29.540 --> 05:29.980]  Bold.
[05:32.200 --> 05:34.300]  Oh, I did the wrong button, you idiot.
[05:34.580 --> 05:35.640]  Why did you do that?
[05:36.400 --> 05:38.220]  Oh, well, frick it, I already...
[05:38.220 --> 05:38.800]  Oh, I suck.
[05:41.080 --> 05:41.880]  That's awesome.
[05:42.800 --> 05:43.860]  Wait, how do you hit...
[05:43.860 --> 05:44.640]  Oh, God, is it down?
[05:44.640 --> 05:46.160]  Oh, what the bloody...
[05:46.160 --> 05:46.920]  Ooh, tough.
[05:47.020 --> 05:47.660]  This is gonna be a tough one.
[05:47.660 --> 05:48.220]  Okay.
[05:49.520 --> 05:51.020]  Oh, it's the bananas.
[05:52.460 --> 05:53.060]  Oh.
[05:55.820 --> 05:57.500]  I'm so good.
[06:00.380 --> 06:02.360]  This one's gonna be really long.
[06:03.000 --> 06:03.620]  I'm panicking.
[06:05.440 --> 06:06.040]  Grapes.
[06:06.080 --> 06:06.780]  I like pictures.
[06:07.400 --> 06:08.220]  Thanks, Geoff.
[06:10.680 --> 06:12.640]  I don't remember the first grapes.
[06:12.800 --> 06:13.460]  I don't either.
[06:13.840 --> 06:14.700]  I remember it so well.
[06:14.700 --> 06:15.840]  Andrew just went for it.
[06:16.920 --> 06:17.360]  Andrew!
[06:17.860 --> 06:18.720]  They're all the same.
[06:19.480 --> 06:20.600]  It's gonna be tough to...
[06:20.600 --> 06:22.760]  Like, it felt too difficult to differentiate grapes.
[06:23.140 --> 06:25.000]  I thought grape leaves could have come into it.
[06:25.120 --> 06:25.400]  Yeah.
[06:25.520 --> 06:25.740]  Ah.
[06:27.060 --> 06:28.560]  I didn't want to blow my grape load.
[06:29.020 --> 06:29.240]  Yep.
[06:29.420 --> 06:30.580]  Oh, for God's sake.
[06:30.720 --> 06:30.840]  Okay.
[06:32.340 --> 06:33.760]  Oh, this is apple leaf, is it?
[06:33.880 --> 06:34.880]  It is.
[06:35.800 --> 06:36.240]  Okay.
[06:37.460 --> 06:38.340]  Oh, shit.
[06:38.820 --> 06:40.440]  Oh, shit.
[06:40.740 --> 06:41.560]  I hit the wrong button.
[06:41.780 --> 06:42.660]  I hit the wrong button.
[06:42.660 --> 06:43.460]  Now I hate myself.
[06:44.640 --> 06:47.020]  I think Gavin maybe got one.
[06:47.740 --> 06:48.630]  Yeah, I got one.
[06:49.740 --> 06:50.820]  We tied for first.
[06:50.980 --> 06:55.180]  The problem I was having was that I was trying so much to be first that I didn't use eyesight.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.980]  I'm my favorite character Donkey Kong Mario.
[07:02.460 --> 07:02.920]  DKBoss.
[07:03.500 --> 07:04.200]  Look at this.
[07:04.200 --> 07:04.220]  Look at this.
[07:04.220 --> 07:04.740]  Look at that.
[07:05.940 --> 07:08.480]  Look at Wario all the way at the bottom like an idiot.
[07:08.480 --> 07:09.880]  I got piped.
[07:10.900 --> 07:13.600]  Even without the bullshit of the first game, I'll be okay in this.
[07:14.800 --> 07:16.180]  Alright, guys, we're almost done.
[07:16.300 --> 07:17.100]  It's your turn, Donkey Kong.
[07:18.120 --> 07:18.880]  Sure is.
[07:19.040 --> 07:20.300]  Come on, Monkey Kong, let's go.
[07:20.800 --> 07:21.340]  Punch it!
[07:21.620 --> 07:21.960]  Yeah!
[07:22.720 --> 07:23.980]  Yeah, boy!
[07:24.620 --> 07:25.400]  You can hold...
[07:25.400 --> 07:25.700]  Yes!
[07:26.040 --> 07:27.320]  Oh, which way are you going?
[07:27.440 --> 07:28.340]  How do I look?
[07:28.600 --> 07:29.660]  Can I at this point?
[07:30.040 --> 07:30.800]  Yeah, I can.
[07:30.800 --> 07:31.280]  I think it's too late.
[07:31.800 --> 07:32.200]  No, no, no.
[07:32.200 --> 07:33.560]  You gotta be able to...
[07:33.560 --> 07:34.420]  Nah.
[07:34.880 --> 07:35.200]  Nah.
[07:35.200 --> 07:35.420]  Nah.
[07:37.100 --> 07:39.440]  You have to build another controller to do that.
[07:42.520 --> 07:44.420]  All items cost one coin?
[07:45.460 --> 07:45.620]  Ooh.
[07:47.340 --> 07:48.460]  Hard times for Kamek.
[07:48.460 --> 07:51.100]  Use over here to make it so their dice can only roll a number from one to three.
[07:51.280 --> 07:51.620]  Kamek?
[07:53.380 --> 07:53.780]  Okay.
[07:54.780 --> 07:55.460]  That's mean.
[07:55.620 --> 07:57.360]  Not bothering to look at the other ones.
[07:57.460 --> 07:57.840]  Cool.
[07:58.160 --> 07:58.760]  I looked at him.
[07:59.400 --> 08:02.560]  I don't want to throw coin spaces behind me and I don't want the...
[08:02.560 --> 08:03.060]  Oh!
[08:03.220 --> 08:03.860]  So, oh!
[08:03.860 --> 08:06.040]  We didn't see the thing move.
[08:06.160 --> 08:07.520]  If you looked at the other ones...
[08:07.900 --> 08:11.880]  I guess Nick controls that, like what I'm looking at, so he could've looked left and right.
[08:11.960 --> 08:12.600]  That's really bizarre.
[08:13.120 --> 08:15.600]  Well, you don't want Nick Pudville and Andrew's shopping experience.
[08:16.320 --> 08:20.800]  It is true, but it should be a private experience between you and your merchant.
[08:20.960 --> 08:23.560]  If Andrew chooses to share, I think that's on him.
[08:25.480 --> 08:25.920]  Ooh!
[08:26.600 --> 08:27.040]  Whoa!
[08:27.320 --> 08:27.760]  Wow!
[08:28.760 --> 08:29.640]  That's huge!
[08:29.700 --> 08:30.560]  What a ten!
[08:31.260 --> 08:33.300]  It's cause I put my whole ass into it.
[08:33.300 --> 08:33.960]  Nice!
[08:36.160 --> 08:36.560]  Okay.
[08:37.680 --> 08:38.080]  Yeah!
[08:38.740 --> 08:39.660]  Okay, Nick, go left and right.
[08:39.700 --> 08:40.600]  I want to see what these other things do.
[08:41.840 --> 08:43.560]  I don't think I... can I?
[08:43.840 --> 08:44.920]  No, I guess it doesn't.
[08:44.960 --> 08:45.840]  It doesn't look like it.
[08:46.660 --> 08:47.340]  Wait, can you?
[08:47.920 --> 08:48.320]  It...
[08:48.320 --> 08:48.680]  No?
[08:48.980 --> 08:49.380]  Nope.
[08:49.860 --> 08:50.880]  Are you using the right stick?
[08:50.880 --> 08:51.720]  It's just showing me what he's doing.
[08:53.100 --> 08:54.040]  I only have one stick.
[08:54.540 --> 08:56.620]  Right, is it opposite of left or opposite of wrong?
[08:57.220 --> 08:57.620]  Wrong.
[08:59.560 --> 09:01.060]  Oh, Geoff got the dice block too.
[09:01.380 --> 09:01.780]  Damn.
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.120]  We got dice nukes.
[09:04.120 --> 09:05.220]  Geoff's heading upstairs.
[09:05.700 --> 09:06.680]  Uh-oh.
[09:08.940 --> 09:10.620]  You can walk up the escalator, buddy.
[09:11.640 --> 09:11.820]  Dear God, I wish you...
[09:11.820 --> 09:13.720]  Has a mole ever been on an escalator, do you think?
[09:14.000 --> 09:14.660]  Oh, no!
[09:14.980 --> 09:16.720]  If it did, it must have been in his pasture.
[09:18.740 --> 09:20.000]  Your turn, Wario.
[09:20.720 --> 09:21.160]  Okay.
[09:23.340 --> 09:24.360]  God damn it.
[09:27.340 --> 09:28.060]  Big tits!
[09:28.480 --> 09:29.140]  Nick's just hitting...
[09:29.140 --> 09:29.460]  Close enough.
[09:29.460 --> 09:29.840]  Shit.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.420]  Every time you tap the stick, the little reaction menu comes up.
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.740]  I doubt that.
[09:37.440 --> 09:39.420]  I want to get a little stamp.
[09:39.680 --> 09:40.000]  Nice.
[09:40.400 --> 09:41.540]  Oh, you can also go this way.
[09:43.180 --> 09:44.360]  Ooh, tough call, Gavin.
[09:44.520 --> 09:45.160]  What are you going to do?
[09:45.300 --> 09:45.740]  Oh, shit.
[09:46.480 --> 09:47.400]  Oh, you can take the elevator.
[09:47.700 --> 09:48.120]  Go up here.
[09:48.740 --> 09:50.860]  Well, the elevator goes up to the third, I think.
[09:53.680 --> 09:55.760]  I didn't even see this as an option.
[09:57.440 --> 09:58.120]  Oh, wow.
[09:58.160 --> 09:59.040]  You're hauling ass.
[09:59.840 --> 10:00.380]  Go downstairs.
[10:00.780 --> 10:01.520]  Damn it.
[10:03.380 --> 10:04.820]  Oh, yeah, I'll buy something, son.
[10:06.540 --> 10:07.340]  Double dice.
[10:07.560 --> 10:08.580]  Can't afford that much.
[10:08.580 --> 10:09.980]  See, because you can't go any...
[10:09.980 --> 10:10.480]  Yeah, we can't.
[10:11.000 --> 10:12.020]  That's so weird.
[10:12.640 --> 10:15.120]  Why wouldn't it show the thing that he's looking at?
[10:16.420 --> 10:18.380]  How much does a star cost in this game?
[10:19.460 --> 10:19.860]  20?
[10:19.980 --> 10:20.540]  20, I think.
[10:21.080 --> 10:21.320]  Okay.
[10:22.240 --> 10:22.860]  You saving up?
[10:22.960 --> 10:23.960]  Alright, die spot, and...
[10:24.440 --> 10:25.360]  I just want a mini-game.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.540]  Well, that's...
[10:27.540 --> 10:29.080]  I'm going to go right through the star.
[10:31.100 --> 10:32.180]  Oh, you're stamping?
[10:33.480 --> 10:34.560]  I'll just go that way.
[10:34.900 --> 10:35.100]  Sure.
[10:35.380 --> 10:36.680]  A lot of people are going the shortcut.
[10:36.920 --> 10:37.900]  It'd be cool to see what's...
[10:37.900 --> 10:39.100]  Oh, you go around the back.
[10:41.260 --> 10:41.540]  Smart.
[10:42.200 --> 10:42.960]  Oh, okay.
[10:46.860 --> 10:49.000]  Oh, you can fast-forward this, by the way.
[10:49.120 --> 10:49.300]  Yeah.
[10:50.200 --> 10:51.040]  I don't know why you would.
[10:52.440 --> 10:53.660]  Right up your nose.
[10:54.760 --> 10:55.180]  3v1.
[10:56.940 --> 10:57.360]  What?
[10:58.000 --> 10:58.420]  What?
[10:58.740 --> 10:59.120]  Wow!
[11:00.680 --> 11:01.120]  This...
[11:01.120 --> 11:01.460]  Okay.
[11:01.800 --> 11:02.240]  Wow!
[11:02.740 --> 11:03.740]  He had enough.
[11:03.860 --> 11:04.340]  Don't give him...
[11:04.340 --> 11:05.140]  You save that for later.
[11:05.320 --> 11:06.280]  Don't take it now.
[11:06.560 --> 11:07.200]  Oh, my God.
[11:07.220 --> 11:08.300]  My heart's beating so fast.
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.280]  With all these coins.
[11:12.440 --> 11:14.440]  Oh, let's beat the shit out of this mole.
[11:14.840 --> 11:16.740]  Yeah, this beaver's fucked, dude.
[11:17.080 --> 11:18.060]  Arch rivals.
[11:21.020 --> 11:21.900]  Alright, team...
[11:21.900 --> 11:23.780]  I'm about to get hard beaved on.
[11:24.060 --> 11:24.380]  Okay.
[11:25.380 --> 11:26.260]  Getting beaved.
[11:26.540 --> 11:28.020]  I don't like the way you said that.
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.240]  Beaved by a mole.
[11:31.160 --> 11:31.560]  Whoa!
[11:32.300 --> 11:33.980]  Oh, he's gonna try to shoot us.
[11:34.340 --> 11:35.320]  Oh, shit.
[11:35.860 --> 11:37.320]  Are you gonna try to make us miss?
[11:38.000 --> 11:38.220]  Yeah.
[11:41.140 --> 11:43.900]  The solo player needs to get 100 points within the time limit.
[11:43.980 --> 11:44.880]  So, we're trying to avoid him.
[11:44.980 --> 11:45.120]  Yeah.
[11:46.100 --> 11:46.500]  Okay.
[11:47.380 --> 11:47.800]  Alright, boys.
[11:47.860 --> 11:48.300]  Got it.
[11:48.820 --> 11:49.740]  Oh, balls.
[11:50.180 --> 11:50.780]  Hit start?
[11:51.000 --> 11:51.720]  Don't let him practice.
[11:51.840 --> 11:52.260]  Hit start.
[11:52.640 --> 11:53.520]  You hit start.
[11:53.620 --> 11:55.020]  You're the one who didn't hit it.
[11:55.360 --> 11:56.380]  Yeah, it's me.
[11:56.400 --> 11:57.060]  I'm not used to this.
[11:58.220 --> 11:59.660]  Just getting after you.
[11:59.980 --> 12:00.200]  Get real.
[12:00.420 --> 12:00.940]  Just hit start.
[12:01.320 --> 12:02.500]  Oh, he's aiming right at me.
[12:07.020 --> 12:08.780]  Stupid-ass fucking rat.
[12:09.660 --> 12:10.140]  Nice save.
[12:10.140 --> 12:10.300]  No!
[12:10.540 --> 12:11.900]  Nick, you suck.
[12:12.380 --> 12:14.020]  Nick, what the god damn is that, Nick?
[12:17.300 --> 12:19.360]  Oh, he won't even try to lean into it.
[12:19.860 --> 12:20.940]  Geoff might have paid him off.
[12:21.860 --> 12:22.260]  No.
[12:23.100 --> 12:23.980]  It's hard to do.
[12:24.320 --> 12:25.120]  You guys are good at DOT.
[12:25.200 --> 12:25.500]  You guys are good.
[12:25.500 --> 12:25.760]  Yeah.
[12:26.900 --> 12:27.760]  That's tough.
[12:27.760 --> 12:28.240]  Oh!
[12:29.200 --> 12:29.680]  What?!
[12:29.680 --> 12:30.600]  Oh, shit, Nick!
[12:30.780 --> 12:32.080]  Stop giving him 30!
[12:32.380 --> 12:34.360]  I'm not trying to give him any fucking points!
[12:35.480 --> 12:36.460]  That was close.
[12:36.800 --> 12:37.320]  One more, Nick.
[12:37.320 --> 12:39.680]  Oh, yeah, all you needed was to pass Nick one more time.
[12:39.960 --> 12:41.720]  Nick gave up 60 points.
[12:41.840 --> 12:43.060]  Are you kidding me?
[12:43.660 --> 12:44.480]  Good job, guys.
[12:45.700 --> 12:47.200]  Nick was the leaky pipe.
[12:47.680 --> 12:48.800]  Yeah, what the hell?
[12:50.660 --> 12:52.580]  Fucking net-whatever.
[12:53.540 --> 12:53.960]  What?
[12:54.140 --> 12:54.500]  The what?
[12:55.720 --> 12:56.120]  Speed.
[12:57.420 --> 12:58.380]  Oh, the net code?
[12:58.920 --> 12:59.580]  Net code!
[12:59.840 --> 13:00.040]  That's it.
[13:00.280 --> 13:01.520]  Net-whatever.
[13:02.440 --> 13:03.240]  Yeah, the net thing.
[13:03.560 --> 13:05.560]  I was like, Alfred, you're a board, not a net.
[13:08.120 --> 13:09.660]  Two more turns until a flash sale.
[13:10.160 --> 13:11.260]  Ooh, a flash sale.
[13:12.740 --> 13:13.540]  Ooh, Rosalina!
[13:15.080 --> 13:15.480]  Rosalina.
[13:16.980 --> 13:19.540]  You had to wait for that to pop up, didn't you?
[13:19.600 --> 13:20.220]  I forgot her name.
[13:21.000 --> 13:21.620]  I didn't play Galaxy.
[13:21.880 --> 13:22.280]  Rosalina.
[13:22.640 --> 13:23.160]  Yeah, me neither.
[13:23.900 --> 13:25.080]  I didn't play Galaxy either.
[13:25.900 --> 13:28.240]  Oh shit, you drag her through a star, you get two stars.
[13:28.700 --> 13:29.020]  Wow.
[13:31.380 --> 13:33.120]  So we just have to get to her?
[13:33.400 --> 13:35.100]  You have to get to her and then get to a star, right?
[13:36.240 --> 13:38.320]  You get to her and then you play to win her, I think.
[13:39.480 --> 13:40.800]  You play to win her.
[13:41.040 --> 13:42.360]  I don't like the way that sounded.
[13:45.860 --> 13:46.840]  Rosalina, please help me.
[13:46.840 --> 13:47.940]  Yeah, why don't you guys go that way?
[13:48.960 --> 13:49.240]  Why not?
[13:51.300 --> 13:51.920]  Great question.
[13:51.920 --> 13:54.280]  Because he can circle back now and get Rosalina.
[13:54.280 --> 13:55.540]  Yeah, I guess I'm just going to go grab Rosalina.
[13:56.160 --> 13:56.320]  Yeah.
[13:57.740 --> 13:58.740]  Give me a stamp.
[13:59.440 --> 14:01.200]  Not if I take the elevator down first.
[14:02.700 --> 14:03.600]  Never mind.
[14:04.440 --> 14:04.940]  He's all yours.
[14:06.640 --> 14:07.820]  Give me them coins!
[14:09.300 --> 14:10.580]  God, your nostrils are huge.
[14:11.900 --> 14:14.520]  And look at this fucking beaver, he doesn't have any nostrils.
[14:15.640 --> 14:17.920]  That's all I need. One, slow and steady.
[14:18.560 --> 14:19.860]  That's all you need?
[14:20.160 --> 14:20.820]  Thank you.
[14:21.920 --> 14:23.480]  Three coins, exactly what I wanted.
[14:26.020 --> 14:26.460]  What?
[14:27.060 --> 14:28.640]  Meg Turney subscribed to Tier 1?
[14:29.800 --> 14:30.240]  Wow!
[14:30.580 --> 14:31.460]  Oh my god!
[14:32.460 --> 14:33.640]  That's my wife!
[14:34.900 --> 14:36.180]  That is your wife!
[14:36.540 --> 14:37.280]  Ah, shit!
[14:37.440 --> 14:37.800]  Oh, I got it.
[14:40.020 --> 14:41.120]  Give me a stamp.
[14:41.240 --> 14:42.380]  I got pink stamps, son.
[14:43.040 --> 14:45.760]  You guys are still married, huh?
[14:46.440 --> 14:46.880]  Yes.
[14:47.220 --> 14:47.820]  That's great.
[14:48.280 --> 14:50.620]  Have you played this with Meg? You played this with Meg now, I assume?
[14:51.380 --> 14:52.520]  I played one time.
[14:52.960 --> 14:54.260]  Oh, okay. How'd that go?
[14:55.520 --> 14:56.240]  Pretty good.
[14:56.660 --> 14:57.320]  That's good.
[14:57.800 --> 14:58.460]  For you or her?
[15:01.400 --> 15:01.860]  Okay.
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.360]  I'm trying to remember who won, actually.
[15:05.980 --> 15:07.100]  Don't try too hard.
[15:08.500 --> 15:09.540]  Shut you down.
[15:10.960 --> 15:12.300]  The entertainment ceased.
[15:13.040 --> 15:14.880]  I'd rather be absent than wrong.
[15:16.700 --> 15:19.820]  I'd rather you just be wrong so we can yell at you.
[15:21.280 --> 15:24.260]  Also, so I didn't think that my internet just dropped.
[15:27.120 --> 15:28.540]  Mostly just like you to be loud.
[15:31.040 --> 15:31.720]  What'd you get?
[15:31.840 --> 15:33.400]  Oh, we have an answer!
[15:34.560 --> 15:37.480]  New subscriber Meg Turney says, I won, you jerk.
[15:40.440 --> 15:44.340]  You can really feel that was a married you jerk, too.
[15:44.500 --> 15:46.260]  That has a little bit of extra weight to it.
[15:46.840 --> 15:47.520]  Oh, right on the red.
[15:48.020 --> 15:49.900]  Are we doing a 3v1? That's fun.
[15:51.340 --> 15:51.860]  Oh...
[15:52.960 --> 15:53.480]  Minigame!
[15:53.780 --> 15:54.300]  Minigame!
[15:54.460 --> 15:55.480]  Alright, everyone beat up Mario.
[15:58.900 --> 15:59.960]  Mario, bye.
[16:02.540 --> 16:03.400]  Cage catch!
[16:04.280 --> 16:04.820]  Ooh, interesting.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.520]  You and Dana White step into a dice block.
[16:08.780 --> 16:09.460]  Oh, shit.
[16:10.520 --> 16:11.560]  Open-handed slaps.
[16:12.300 --> 16:14.300]  Team, move Cage up and down.
[16:15.220 --> 16:16.020]  We have to bag him.
[16:17.020 --> 16:18.340]  Oh, you have to try to get him.
[16:18.340 --> 16:20.440]  Oh, and then he has to keep moving.
[16:21.440 --> 16:23.320]  Oh, wow, that's really fast.
[16:23.620 --> 16:25.940]  We get multiple turns, that's cool.
[16:26.340 --> 16:27.380]  You guys gotta communicate.
[16:30.200 --> 16:31.100]  Please don't.
[16:32.200 --> 16:34.780]  You guys get over him, I'll fucking smash it down.
[16:37.880 --> 16:39.200]  Any time now, Geoff.
[16:39.980 --> 16:41.100]  I'm just practicing.
[16:41.740 --> 16:42.260]  Yeah, no need.
[16:44.760 --> 16:46.200]  Two hours, Geoff!
[16:48.600 --> 16:49.920]  We'll see about that.
[16:49.980 --> 16:53.600]  You think the two hours is to account for reading time and practice time?
[16:57.260 --> 16:58.900]  You went off a bit soon there.
[17:01.080 --> 17:03.100]  Bait him, bait him, bait him.
[17:03.940 --> 17:04.900]  I'd like to see you bait me.
[17:05.660 --> 17:05.860]  What?
[17:06.820 --> 17:07.140]  What?
[17:07.800 --> 17:09.380]  Nick wants you to masturbate him.
[17:12.320 --> 17:13.320]  You suck!
[17:15.140 --> 17:16.140]  Eat shit.
[17:16.140 --> 17:19.380]  Oh, shit, Mark the Frog is here.
[17:19.660 --> 17:21.700]  Dude, Mark the Frog is here.
[17:21.720 --> 17:22.640]  We got Manny, we got Mark the Frog.
[17:22.920 --> 17:24.880]  The gang's all here.
[17:25.220 --> 17:26.540]  Mark the Frog earlier said,
[17:26.620 --> 17:36.140]  Anyone know the RLA for a train compressor in RTU model WSC048A3ROA2000000-A?
[17:37.320 --> 17:37.780]  Thanks, Mark.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.620]  It's 16.2, right?
[17:40.160 --> 17:40.860]  A flash sale.
[17:42.840 --> 17:44.080]  Ooh, flash sale starts.
[17:45.560 --> 17:46.960]  Shit, it's cheap.
[17:47.520 --> 17:48.740]  I like this on the bottom.
[17:48.980 --> 17:49.100]  Hell yeah.
[17:49.140 --> 17:49.940]  This is very cool.
[17:51.800 --> 17:53.960]  Get those Donkey Kongs in the chat, hell yeah.
[18:01.470 --> 18:02.870]  She's giving away bunts.
[18:04.230 --> 18:05.470]  Oh, shit, it goes...
[18:05.470 --> 18:07.450]  I see, okay.
[18:07.670 --> 18:08.590]  I thought I'd just get her.
[18:08.810 --> 18:08.950]  Okay.
[18:10.390 --> 18:11.030]  Oh, wow.
[18:12.070 --> 18:13.950]  I feel like I've just helped every...
[18:13.950 --> 18:14.190]  Okay.
[18:14.310 --> 18:14.590]  Yes.
[18:15.110 --> 18:16.250]  But you got the advantage.
[18:16.250 --> 18:16.910]  Okay.
[18:18.590 --> 18:22.670]  It's an advantage when you don't have any experience with any of the mini-games.
[18:23.630 --> 18:24.910]  How? How will she help us?
[18:27.110 --> 18:27.950]  Oh, fuck.
[18:31.150 --> 18:33.410]  Alright, let's do this.
[18:35.370 --> 18:35.810]  Okay.
[18:36.710 --> 18:37.150]  Vertical.
[18:38.290 --> 18:38.610]  Uh-oh.
[18:38.790 --> 18:39.350]  Nick, you got this?
[18:39.390 --> 18:41.230]  Oh, is it like, shake the can?
[18:42.550 --> 18:43.010]  Uh-oh.
[18:45.730 --> 18:46.570]  That'll do.
[18:46.850 --> 18:47.050]  That'll do, pig?
[18:48.170 --> 18:48.610]  Okay.
[18:50.670 --> 18:52.910]  Okay, it's Rosalina's Radical Race.
[18:52.970 --> 18:53.590]  You guys got it.
[18:54.610 --> 18:56.590]  Shake at the right time for big jumps.
[18:57.830 --> 18:58.610]  You got it.
[18:59.630 --> 19:00.070]  Okay.
[19:00.630 --> 19:01.370]  You got it, hit the button.
[19:01.730 --> 19:02.030]  Let's go.
[19:02.050 --> 19:02.790]  Big time.
[19:03.290 --> 19:04.790]  Yeah, it's 1080 snowboarding.
[19:04.890 --> 19:05.350]  You got this.
[19:05.890 --> 19:07.350]  It's like SSX Tricky, Geoff.
[19:07.350 --> 19:07.390]  Oh, wow.
[19:07.590 --> 19:07.990]  You got it.
[19:08.290 --> 19:09.230]  1080p snowboarding.
[19:09.590 --> 19:09.770]  Yeah.
[19:10.730 --> 19:11.050]  Shh.
[19:13.690 --> 19:14.330]  Oh, wow.
[19:14.330 --> 19:15.010]  What an advantage.
[19:15.790 --> 19:16.890]  Well, not on a Switch.
[19:20.270 --> 19:20.590]  1080i.
[19:20.610 --> 19:21.170]  Hell yeah, dude.
[19:21.190 --> 19:21.590]  It's tricky.
[19:22.450 --> 19:23.330]  Oh, come on, Andrew.
[19:23.430 --> 19:24.330]  Don't bump into stuff.
[19:24.530 --> 19:25.370]  Hell yeah.
[19:25.970 --> 19:26.870]  That's why I got my advantage.
[19:27.610 --> 19:28.650]  Andrew's just gone.
[19:29.290 --> 19:30.190]  It's because I got an advantage.
[19:30.550 --> 19:31.110]  Yeah, he got the advantage.
[19:31.110 --> 19:33.050]  That advantage was horse shit.
[19:33.130 --> 19:34.550]  Yeah, I just felt like it would be a smaller advantage.
[19:34.790 --> 19:35.350]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[19:35.470 --> 19:36.250]  There you go.
[19:36.530 --> 19:36.850]  Nice.
[19:37.650 --> 19:38.090]  Oh, get it.
[19:38.090 --> 19:39.070]  Go, beaver, go.
[19:40.030 --> 19:42.090]  Wouldn't be an advantage if it wasn't advantageous.
[19:44.030 --> 19:45.510]  Geoff, you've got to lean.
[19:45.810 --> 19:46.230]  There you go.
[19:46.470 --> 19:47.010]  Yeah, I'm leaning.
[19:48.610 --> 19:49.470]  Missed the jumps.
[19:51.290 --> 19:52.990]  Go, go, go, go.
[19:54.250 --> 19:56.030]  This ape is out of control.
[19:57.570 --> 19:58.570]  I've seen him do V3.
[19:58.790 --> 19:59.990]  I've seen him do V3.
[20:00.150 --> 20:01.210]  This is monkey madness.
[20:02.690 --> 20:03.730]  Oh, balls, I missed that.
[20:04.950 --> 20:06.910]  Geoff, you've got to shake it when you're in the air, dude.
[20:07.450 --> 20:07.770]  Yeah.
[20:08.150 --> 20:10.410]  I keep shaking and I keep jumping over the ramp.
[20:11.270 --> 20:12.370]  Tap into my inner jack.
[20:12.710 --> 20:13.650]  Oh, you missed it.
[20:15.310 --> 20:17.110]  Alright, my control is shit in itself.
[20:17.630 --> 20:18.170]  Come on, rat.
[20:18.310 --> 20:18.630]  Oh, yeah.
[20:18.810 --> 20:19.890]  Come on, you little beaver, go.
[20:21.230 --> 20:22.290]  Shit, shit, shit.
[20:22.410 --> 20:23.150]  Okay, well, I've got it.
[20:23.470 --> 20:24.250]  There you go.
[20:25.290 --> 20:27.690]  No, you took my boost, you dickhead rat.
[20:30.130 --> 20:31.190]  Oh, missed the one on the left.
[20:31.270 --> 20:31.710]  Get the one on the right.
[20:31.790 --> 20:32.690]  There you go, go, go, go.
[20:33.350 --> 20:34.030]  Oh, it's like F-Zero.
[20:34.290 --> 20:35.030]  Oh, Wario missed.
[20:35.850 --> 20:36.490]  I suck.
[20:36.910 --> 20:37.790]  You suck, Wario.
[20:39.030 --> 20:40.290]  You suck ass.
[20:40.310 --> 20:40.470]  Ready?
[20:40.830 --> 20:41.330]  Shake it, Geoff.
[20:41.650 --> 20:42.630]  Oh, you didn't shake it.
[20:42.690 --> 20:43.330]  I'm shaking it.
[20:43.550 --> 20:44.150]  No, you blew it.
[20:44.150 --> 20:45.410]  No, you idiot, you blew it.
[20:45.470 --> 20:46.250]  There you go.
[20:47.070 --> 20:47.450]  No.
[20:48.530 --> 20:49.750]  It's a boost, it's a boost.
[20:50.070 --> 20:50.770]  You're on his tail.
[20:50.770 --> 20:51.270]  I'm blowing it.
[20:51.350 --> 20:51.730]  Mario.
[20:52.170 --> 20:52.870]  I'm blowing it.
[20:53.890 --> 20:54.310]  No.
[20:54.510 --> 20:54.910]  Geoff.
[20:56.790 --> 20:58.040]  God, just end.
[20:59.730 --> 21:00.470]  Oh, shit.
[21:00.730 --> 21:01.670]  No, you little rat.
[21:01.670 --> 21:02.930]  How fucking long is this?
[21:04.230 --> 21:05.110]  Hit it, hit it.
[21:05.290 --> 21:05.710]  No.
[21:05.710 --> 21:08.070]  Oh, you fucking rat.
[21:08.330 --> 21:09.150]  Go, Geoff, go.
[21:09.270 --> 21:09.890]  Come on.
[21:10.470 --> 21:11.570]  I've got you, you bitch.
[21:11.730 --> 21:13.290]  No, no, no.
[21:15.430 --> 21:16.650]  Oh, I just missed that.
[21:16.670 --> 21:17.270]  You missed it.
[21:17.390 --> 21:17.870]  You blew it.
[21:17.890 --> 21:19.170]  Let me get there.
[21:19.910 --> 21:20.350]  Goddamnit.
[21:20.470 --> 21:21.710]  Oh, my God.
[21:22.010 --> 21:22.290]  That's so long.
[21:27.050 --> 21:28.370]  That's a Donkey Kong adventure.
[21:28.510 --> 21:29.810]  He's got no teeth, he's going ape.
[21:29.970 --> 21:30.530]  This is crazy.
[21:31.530 --> 21:32.150]  Just Andrew.
[21:32.530 --> 21:33.650]  And, and.
[21:34.430 --> 21:36.870]  I kept missing all the boosts at the end.
[21:37.110 --> 21:37.670]  Yep.
[21:38.050 --> 21:40.070]  Piece of shit, motion controls.
[21:40.470 --> 21:41.030]  Shite.
[21:41.710 --> 21:42.610]  That was bullshit.
[21:44.510 --> 21:45.250]  Fucking Andrew.
[21:47.070 --> 21:51.710]  So if anyone runs, if anyone runs past Andrew, they just take it.
[21:52.190 --> 21:52.910]  Oh, wow, really?
[21:52.910 --> 21:53.330]  No.
[21:53.630 --> 21:54.470]  Are you serious?
[21:54.970 --> 21:55.190]  Yeah.
[21:56.290 --> 21:57.230]  That's bullshit.
[21:59.750 --> 22:01.650]  What were you snowboarding for?
[22:01.770 --> 22:02.130]  That's ridiculous.
[22:06.610 --> 22:09.830]  How am I going to get a discount on $1 items?
[22:16.930 --> 22:17.890]  That's great.
[22:20.470 --> 22:23.050]  Mr. Junk says, was Gavin even trying?
[22:23.590 --> 22:24.190]  No.
[22:24.890 --> 22:25.850]  That's why I lost.
[22:27.430 --> 22:29.650]  I don't have any space for another item.
[22:30.210 --> 22:32.370]  I was doing a bit where I suck at snowboarding.
[22:34.470 --> 22:35.750]  Oh, poor Andrew.
[22:36.410 --> 22:37.770]  I don't have any room.
[22:45.510 --> 22:48.390]  So yeah, I was trying and it was unfortunate.
[22:48.970 --> 22:50.070]  Yeah, it happens.
[22:50.750 --> 22:52.190]  Yeah, you know that happens.
[22:52.990 --> 22:53.930]  They give me 52 coins.
[22:54.050 --> 22:54.490]  That's good.
[22:55.870 --> 22:56.510]  Wow.
[22:58.590 --> 23:00.490]  I am winning though.
[23:00.590 --> 23:01.110]  Uh oh.
[23:01.430 --> 23:01.970]  Wow.
[23:01.970 --> 23:02.730]  Never mind.
[23:02.770 --> 23:03.790]  Never mind.
[23:04.470 --> 23:04.950]  What?
[23:05.230 --> 23:05.470]  No.
[23:06.190 --> 23:06.730]  Damn it.
[23:07.630 --> 23:08.110]  Wow.
[23:10.130 --> 23:11.170]  Coin rich, dude.
[23:11.830 --> 23:13.070]  Alright, honey mole.
[23:15.590 --> 23:16.250]  Here comes rat.
[23:17.710 --> 23:19.330]  This little rat, dude.
[23:19.570 --> 23:20.670]  Are you going to use your creepy dice block?
[23:21.110 --> 23:21.850]  I think so.
[23:22.230 --> 23:23.170]  Who are you going to use it on?
[23:23.670 --> 23:24.870]  Why would you do that?
[23:26.550 --> 23:27.770]  Andrew's throwing bad ideas.
[23:28.270 --> 23:29.010]  Just no reason.
[23:29.190 --> 23:30.730]  Just no reason to do it.
[23:30.730 --> 23:32.610]  There's nothing there that's going to fuck him up.
[23:32.710 --> 23:33.370]  That's great.
[23:33.710 --> 23:35.250]  You said you were in first place.
[23:35.790 --> 23:36.270]  You would have.
[23:36.510 --> 23:37.930]  But you're in first place.
[23:38.210 --> 23:38.870]  Taken Rosalina.
[23:39.730 --> 23:40.790]  Yeah, but you're in first place.
[23:41.330 --> 23:42.550]  That doesn't mean anything.
[23:43.430 --> 23:46.150]  Why would you steal Rosalina for using a dice block on me?
[23:46.390 --> 23:46.910]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[23:47.290 --> 23:48.230]  You got beefed, dude.
[23:49.690 --> 23:50.130]  Beefed.
[23:51.170 --> 23:56.230]  I just don't want to get in a situation where I can't use a power up because I have too many power ups.
[23:56.550 --> 23:57.070]  I want to clear them out.
[23:57.770 --> 23:58.150]  I'm good.
[23:58.610 --> 23:58.990]  Plumbing.
[23:58.990 --> 24:00.110]  Going mobile.
[24:00.230 --> 24:01.430]  I like it.
[24:01.490 --> 24:02.370]  Dude, mark the frog.
[24:02.510 --> 24:03.510]  Anyone else on a roof today?
[24:03.730 --> 24:05.210]  I fucking love this guy.
[24:10.150 --> 24:14.610]  Yo, sound off in the chat if you're on a roof.
[24:18.210 --> 24:19.130]  Oh, man.
[24:19.690 --> 24:20.650]  Oh, you go back downstairs?
[24:21.110 --> 24:21.510]  Go down.
[24:21.790 --> 24:22.070]  Go down.
[24:22.910 --> 24:23.810]  Oh, hi, Mark.
[24:26.270 --> 24:27.050]  Got downstairs.
[24:27.610 --> 24:28.570]  Oh, he's going downstairs.
[24:28.570 --> 24:30.570]  Very funny, Nina Oworld.
[24:33.310 --> 24:34.790]  Oh, we can catch him.
[24:34.830 --> 24:35.670]  He's right here.
[24:36.130 --> 24:36.790]  He got another stamp.
[24:36.850 --> 24:37.470]  Oh, stop my shit.
[24:37.830 --> 24:38.790]  What does the stamp say?
[24:39.450 --> 24:40.190]  I don't know.
[24:40.810 --> 24:41.770]  He's doing something.
[24:42.250 --> 24:44.490]  If you get all four stamps, I think you get 50 coins.
[24:44.910 --> 24:45.350]  Wow.
[24:45.850 --> 24:46.650]  That's a lot.
[24:47.730 --> 24:48.170]  Wow.
[24:48.430 --> 24:48.910]  Bunch of coins.
[24:49.310 --> 24:50.630]  Everyone throw your blocks at him.
[24:50.730 --> 24:51.470]  He knows what he's doing.
[24:51.910 --> 24:52.530]  I don't like it.
[24:52.690 --> 24:53.390]  Here we go.
[24:53.590 --> 24:54.650]  All right, and...
[24:54.650 --> 24:55.790]  Hey, I did my part.
[24:57.030 --> 24:58.070]  You made me gammy.
[24:58.070 --> 24:59.730]  Okay, which way?
[25:00.790 --> 25:02.070]  Go get your stamp, Nick.
[25:02.550 --> 25:03.170]  I doubt it.
[25:03.270 --> 25:03.890]  We're going after...
[25:03.890 --> 25:04.550]  Weird.
[25:04.990 --> 25:05.630]  We're going after Andrew.
[25:05.990 --> 25:07.010]  Oh, nice.
[25:07.050 --> 25:07.890]  That's actually smart.
[25:08.490 --> 25:09.570]  That's actually really smart.
[25:11.230 --> 25:12.330]  Go ahead and get your stamp.
[25:15.770 --> 25:17.410]  It's like you're trying to complete a labyrinth.
[25:18.510 --> 25:18.750]  Yes.
[25:19.250 --> 25:20.290]  Oh, okay.
[25:20.810 --> 25:21.510]  You can also...
[25:21.510 --> 25:22.190]  One coin shop.
[25:22.330 --> 25:22.770]  Let's take a look.
[25:23.010 --> 25:23.610]  Here's the thing.
[25:23.770 --> 25:25.850]  You keep him moving slow, you can catch him.
[25:27.230 --> 25:27.650]  Yeah?
[25:27.890 --> 25:28.310]  Yeah?
[25:28.570 --> 25:29.590]  Yeah, catch that motherfucker.
[25:29.930 --> 25:30.030]  Nick?
[25:30.370 --> 25:31.470]  I'm going to use this.
[25:31.570 --> 25:33.470]  Nick, this is a Cold War dice game.
[25:35.150 --> 25:37.150]  Listen, it's going to get freezing in a minute.
[25:40.870 --> 25:41.290]  Hey.
[25:41.490 --> 25:42.070]  When I catch you.
[25:42.090 --> 25:43.170]  This guy's insane.
[25:43.670 --> 25:44.130]  Oh my god.
[25:44.230 --> 25:45.630]  You should catch him right here, don't you?
[25:45.830 --> 25:46.510]  You already got me.
[25:46.530 --> 25:47.850]  You're catching him right here.
[25:48.430 --> 25:49.210]  That's insane.
[25:49.630 --> 25:51.270]  Oh, that's snowboarding.
[25:53.310 --> 25:53.730]  Hello.
[25:54.330 --> 25:56.590]  My shitty dice rolls have paid off.
[25:56.670 --> 25:57.350]  Oh, wait.
[25:57.430 --> 25:58.630]  You didn't pass him.
[25:58.710 --> 25:59.590]  Did you get him?
[25:59.770 --> 26:00.230]  Does it matter if you...
[26:00.230 --> 26:01.390]  Oh, you have to pass him?
[26:01.490 --> 26:02.650]  You're right up his ass now.
[26:02.810 --> 26:03.770]  Oh my god.
[26:06.390 --> 26:08.730]  You better be a fast ass dude.
[26:09.570 --> 26:10.110]  Stamp out.
[26:10.410 --> 26:10.890]  You better roll 10.
[26:12.490 --> 26:13.390]  He's coming up.
[26:14.210 --> 26:14.870]  Your ass.
[26:15.690 --> 26:16.450]  Yeah, boy.
[26:16.530 --> 26:16.930]  Oh, okay.
[26:17.050 --> 26:17.470]  Turn, jump.
[26:17.830 --> 26:18.010]  Oh.
[26:18.810 --> 26:20.250]  Stamp your color onto the paper.
[26:21.010 --> 26:21.850]  Oh, wow.
[26:23.130 --> 26:25.470]  Dude, look at Andrew going ape over there.
[26:26.870 --> 26:28.030]  Okay, everyone hit start.
[26:28.110 --> 26:28.410]  Let's go.
[26:29.590 --> 26:30.690]  15 turns, guys.
[26:30.810 --> 26:31.590]  Come on.
[26:33.490 --> 26:34.210]  Two hours.
[26:40.230 --> 26:41.810]  If you hold jump, is it bigger?
[26:42.630 --> 26:43.610]  You need to go further.
[26:44.150 --> 26:44.570]  Nice.
[26:45.550 --> 26:46.150]  Oh, wow.
[26:48.910 --> 26:49.670]  Look at that.
[26:52.870 --> 26:55.390]  Hey, Yellow's doing too good over here.
[26:55.670 --> 26:57.310]  He's kind of crushing it.
[27:00.010 --> 27:01.470]  I don't know if we...
[27:01.470 --> 27:02.850]  You better get up to that left, Nick.
[27:03.610 --> 27:04.690]  Oh, look at that.
[27:06.530 --> 27:07.410]  It's Donkey Kong.
[27:07.690 --> 27:08.250]  Is it going to be Donkey Kong?
[27:08.250 --> 27:09.030]  I think it's Donkey Kong.
[27:09.370 --> 27:10.370]  Where's the monkeys at?
[27:11.270 --> 27:11.690]  Yeah!
[27:12.610 --> 27:13.290]  Let's go.
[27:14.650 --> 27:15.510]  Kong's in the chat.
[27:17.330 --> 27:18.990]  I thought you said hogs in the chat.
[27:19.350 --> 27:20.450]  Hogs in Kong's.
[27:22.350 --> 27:28.590]  Hey, Andrew, when are we doing the fuck face-off again?
[27:29.270 --> 27:29.390]  Soon.
[27:29.690 --> 27:30.930]  We're working on it.
[27:30.930 --> 27:31.310]  We're building.
[27:31.510 --> 27:32.230]  We're making teams.
[27:32.390 --> 27:33.150]  Oh, I need to...
[27:33.150 --> 27:33.990]  I owe you something.
[27:35.310 --> 27:35.790]  You do?
[27:35.930 --> 27:36.390]  That's okay.
[27:36.630 --> 27:39.350]  Geoff, I have a thing to show you.
[27:39.790 --> 27:40.450]  Okay, cool.
[27:41.690 --> 27:41.830]  Oh, what?
[27:42.350 --> 27:42.810]  Shoppers!
[27:43.570 --> 27:44.250]  Oh, shit.
[27:45.210 --> 27:46.370]  We have a flash sale.
[27:47.170 --> 27:49.170]  All items are priced, including the star.
[27:49.970 --> 27:50.430]  Wow.
[27:50.430 --> 27:50.770]  Wow.
[27:51.470 --> 27:55.430]  So that means if you have Rosalina, you can get two stars for 20.
[27:55.970 --> 27:56.470]  What is she doing?
[27:56.650 --> 27:57.090]  What's happening?
[27:57.350 --> 27:57.910]  What is she doing?
[27:59.910 --> 28:00.230]  No.
[28:00.610 --> 28:03.150]  Oh, she's giving you stuff in return.
[28:03.170 --> 28:04.810]  You should use that right now.
[28:05.050 --> 28:06.430]  Oh, I do, actually.
[28:07.450 --> 28:08.510]  No, I gotta listen.
[28:08.590 --> 28:09.570]  You have to pick something to get rid of.
[28:10.210 --> 28:11.350]  You gotta pick something to get rid of.
[28:11.510 --> 28:12.850]  Oh, I gotta pick something to get rid of.
[28:12.930 --> 28:13.750]  Get rid of a pipe.
[28:14.530 --> 28:15.230]  Just stay where you're at.
[28:15.350 --> 28:15.830]  Get rid of a pipe.
[28:16.410 --> 28:17.910]  Yeah, Andrew, get off the pipe.
[28:19.670 --> 28:20.070]  Never.
[28:20.290 --> 28:21.170]  Wasn't my pick.
[28:23.430 --> 28:25.870]  Hell yeah, dude, do it, do it, do it.
[28:26.350 --> 28:27.110]  Yeah, do it.
[28:27.210 --> 28:28.250]  Oh, wait, no, don't do it.
[28:28.310 --> 28:29.910]  He's not using it on Mario, yeah.
[28:30.750 --> 28:31.610]  Oh, yeah.
[28:32.190 --> 28:33.790]  Oh, this is unfortunate.
[28:35.090 --> 28:36.450]  Alright, roll a one.
[28:36.470 --> 28:38.330]  And now he's just gotta hope to...
[28:38.330 --> 28:39.950]  I thought I could use multiple items.
[28:40.410 --> 28:42.110]  What? Are you new to this game?
[28:43.250 --> 28:44.110]  Yeah, I am.
[28:44.170 --> 28:45.230]  This is my first time playing.
[28:45.810 --> 28:46.790]  Couldn't be more new.
[28:47.250 --> 28:48.670]  Roll a one, roll a one, roll a one.
[28:50.770 --> 28:51.310]  That's bad.
[28:51.770 --> 28:53.010]  Yep, you're not gonna pass him, dude.
[28:53.690 --> 28:54.350]  No, hold on.
[28:54.410 --> 28:54.710]  Wait, what?
[28:55.250 --> 28:55.410]  Yep.
[28:57.570 --> 28:58.730]  Go back five spaces.
[28:59.370 --> 29:02.090]  Thanks to all the customers who spent coins, we're holding a raffle.
[29:03.090 --> 29:06.650]  The number of purchases you made was two, so the number of drawings you get to make is also two.
[29:06.930 --> 29:07.950]  Two drawings.
[29:08.510 --> 29:09.390]  Put your hand in there.
[29:09.910 --> 29:10.750]  Gold, gold, gold.
[29:11.090 --> 29:12.010]  Oh, you got a green ball.
[29:12.650 --> 29:14.470]  Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold.
[29:15.470 --> 29:15.910]  Oh.
[29:16.510 --> 29:17.450]  Way to go, man.
[29:17.730 --> 29:18.530]  Six coins.
[29:18.790 --> 29:20.230]  Not bad for nothing, you know.
[29:22.750 --> 29:23.770]  You're at a profit.
[29:23.990 --> 29:24.950]  I mean, like, you spent two.
[29:24.950 --> 29:25.470]  That's true.
[29:26.310 --> 29:27.690]  Montgomery J. Mole.
[29:28.550 --> 29:29.290]  That's my full name.
[29:30.410 --> 29:30.570]  Ten.
[29:30.670 --> 29:31.950]  Oh, Geoff.
[29:36.670 --> 29:38.210]  Now you gotta think about it.
[29:38.270 --> 29:38.790]  Which way are you going?
[29:39.030 --> 29:39.850]  Okay, flash sale.
[29:41.630 --> 29:42.190]  Half off.
[29:43.270 --> 29:44.130]  Oh, wow.
[29:44.670 --> 29:45.570]  200%?
[29:45.770 --> 29:47.230]  Oh, I don't know what this stuff does.
[29:47.970 --> 29:49.290]  All right, let's see.
[29:49.750 --> 29:50.270]  Whoa.
[29:50.750 --> 29:51.150]  Holy shit.
[29:51.450 --> 29:53.110]  Roll two dice and move the total amount.
[29:53.250 --> 29:53.950]  Markup sticker.
[29:54.390 --> 29:56.350]  Ooh, double the price of items and stars.
[29:59.170 --> 29:59.690]  Oh.
[30:03.990 --> 30:05.550]  We can't see what they all do.
[30:05.590 --> 30:06.430]  Geoff's being secretive.
[30:07.230 --> 30:12.830]  I'm gonna go with this one.
[30:13.730 --> 30:14.410]  What's that do?
[30:14.630 --> 30:14.870]  Oh.
[30:15.750 --> 30:17.290]  That lets me warp to an opponent's space.
[30:17.930 --> 30:18.590]  Oh, wow.
[30:19.450 --> 30:19.930]  Oh, my God.
[30:19.990 --> 30:20.590]  You can warp to Andrew.
[30:20.690 --> 30:21.310]  You can steal Rosalina.
[30:21.490 --> 30:21.610]  No.
[30:21.890 --> 30:22.210]  No.
[30:22.830 --> 30:24.310]  No, I think they would just...
[30:24.310 --> 30:24.690]  Oh.
[30:25.530 --> 30:25.930]  Yeah.
[30:26.050 --> 30:26.830]  He's getting his stamp.
[30:28.230 --> 30:28.630]  Yay.
[30:28.830 --> 30:29.490]  I'm on the board.
[30:29.970 --> 30:31.030]  The stamp board.
[30:34.270 --> 30:35.410]  A stamp board.
[30:35.890 --> 30:37.170]  Which way do I want to go?
[30:37.410 --> 30:39.770]  That's a lucky space right there, though, isn't it?
[30:39.770 --> 30:42.510]  If you change the direction, it will tell you how many from the star.
[30:43.970 --> 30:44.770]  Oh, interesting.
[30:45.150 --> 30:45.490]  That's cool.
[30:45.650 --> 30:46.810]  I wish I'd paid attention to that.
[30:49.090 --> 30:49.530]  Nice.
[30:50.150 --> 30:51.190]  Damn, that's good.
[30:51.370 --> 30:51.890]  Not bad.
[30:53.430 --> 30:54.590]  Roll whatever you want.
[30:54.690 --> 30:55.290]  I wish I had one of those.
[30:58.150 --> 31:00.810]  I want to get some shopping in on this flash sale.
[31:01.210 --> 31:02.310]  Yeah, you better get big here.
[31:03.770 --> 31:04.410]  Big tents?
[31:05.010 --> 31:06.370]  Son of a bitch.
[31:10.290 --> 31:12.450]  Couldn't even make it to the dollar store.
[31:13.090 --> 31:16.990]  Oh, man.
[31:17.210 --> 31:19.390]  Oh, yeah, can you use that here, even though you have that other thing?
[31:19.470 --> 31:19.770]  Yes, I can.
[31:21.930 --> 31:22.250]  Shit.
[31:22.510 --> 31:22.830]  Okay.
[31:23.910 --> 31:24.610]  Not a three.
[31:24.770 --> 31:25.510]  Not a three.
[31:25.830 --> 31:28.510]  I mean, all it is, it's going to be one or a two, right?
[31:29.330 --> 31:30.170]  No, because it'll...
[31:30.170 --> 31:31.150]  Oh, it got rid of my thing.
[31:31.310 --> 31:32.530]  It canceled the effect of the other one.
[31:33.150 --> 31:33.470]  Wow.
[31:35.210 --> 31:35.850]  Dude, you...
[31:35.850 --> 31:36.250]  Yeah.
[31:38.230 --> 31:38.550]  Wow.
[31:38.550 --> 31:39.210]  Wow.
[31:39.610 --> 31:41.490]  You son of a bitch.
[31:41.630 --> 31:42.910]  It's an ape escape.
[31:43.790 --> 31:44.310]  Damn.
[31:45.750 --> 31:46.650]  He took the bag, baby.
[31:47.430 --> 31:49.750]  Receive items until you're at max capacity?
[31:50.190 --> 31:50.630]  Wow.
[31:50.810 --> 31:52.210]  Oh, my God, he's going to get three.
[31:53.050 --> 31:54.230]  He didn't have any items.
[31:54.750 --> 31:55.490]  Oh, my God.
[31:57.170 --> 31:57.690]  Yes.
[31:58.190 --> 32:00.370]  Oh, Mario Party's such bullshit.
[32:01.050 --> 32:01.130]  Wow.
[32:01.430 --> 32:01.690]  Yes.
[32:04.210 --> 32:05.490]  I want you to pass me now, Andrew.
[32:05.830 --> 32:06.310]  Three dice.
[32:06.950 --> 32:07.070]  Damn it.
[32:07.650 --> 32:08.170]  Jeez.
[32:09.190 --> 32:10.110]  This is crazy.
[32:10.250 --> 32:11.790]  Mario's going to get moving.
[32:12.250 --> 32:13.390]  Yeah, like...
[32:13.390 --> 32:13.710]  What?
[32:13.990 --> 32:14.590]  I get more?
[32:15.510 --> 32:16.630]  Oh, because you landed on the luck.
[32:17.010 --> 32:17.590]  15 coins.
[32:18.330 --> 32:20.670]  At the next turn, she's going to give you something, I think.
[32:22.850 --> 32:25.030]  And the seal, God damn it.
[32:26.510 --> 32:27.930]  Look at all those shopping bags.
[32:28.530 --> 32:29.490]  This game is nuts.
[32:32.130 --> 32:32.650]  Wow.
[32:33.410 --> 32:34.690]  What turn is this?
[32:34.910 --> 32:35.830]  Bonus minigame?
[32:35.830 --> 32:36.970]  Turn five.
[32:37.470 --> 32:38.110]  Oh, man.
[32:38.330 --> 32:38.730]  No!
[32:41.210 --> 32:43.070]  This has been bad luck so far.
[32:43.350 --> 32:43.550]  Yeah.
[32:44.510 --> 32:45.390]  Blame it on the crane.
[32:45.450 --> 32:46.090]  Blame it on the crane.
[32:46.330 --> 32:47.330]  Oh, a crane game.
[32:48.710 --> 32:49.510]  Remember when...
[32:49.510 --> 32:49.910]  Who was it?
[32:49.950 --> 32:52.950]  Was it Gavin who went down on the crane and missed everyone?
[32:53.210 --> 32:54.190]  Gavin went down on a crane?
[32:54.330 --> 32:54.950]  I went down on it.
[32:54.950 --> 32:55.370]  He did.
[32:56.690 --> 32:58.750]  Yeah, you remember when you were sucking that crane off?
[32:58.810 --> 32:58.930]  Yeah.
[33:00.970 --> 33:01.590]  All right.
[33:02.290 --> 33:02.810]  Hit it.
[33:02.850 --> 33:03.150]  Let's go.
[33:04.330 --> 33:05.550]  I could have phrased that better.
[33:05.830 --> 33:06.370]  Okay.
[33:06.630 --> 33:07.330]  Come on, monkey.
[33:07.970 --> 33:10.350]  All right, we've got to not get caught, Nick.
[33:11.270 --> 33:11.610]  Okay.
[33:11.810 --> 33:13.130]  All right, who's it going to be?
[33:13.430 --> 33:14.730]  Wait, why are you telling me?
[33:17.950 --> 33:18.390]  Nice.
[33:22.530 --> 33:22.970]  No!
[33:23.870 --> 33:24.610]  Dumb beaver.
[33:25.430 --> 33:26.350]  I'm such a dumb beaver.
[33:26.350 --> 33:27.090]  Get out of here, mole.
[33:28.890 --> 33:29.110]  Uh-oh.
[33:30.770 --> 33:31.190]  Ah!
[33:31.430 --> 33:32.690]  Oh, come on!
[33:34.250 --> 33:34.770]  Wow.
[33:36.370 --> 33:37.730]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[33:38.090 --> 33:38.910]  Come on!
[33:39.690 --> 33:41.030]  Oh, there's too much traffic.
[33:41.430 --> 33:42.630]  Nick is baiting him, dude.
[33:43.130 --> 33:45.850]  Nick is crazy mode right now.
[33:46.970 --> 33:47.490]  Shit.
[33:48.190 --> 33:48.210]  Wow.
[33:50.750 --> 33:51.270]  No!
[33:52.170 --> 33:53.170]  Gavin, my hubris!
[33:53.570 --> 33:54.670]  Gavin, run, run, run!
[33:55.050 --> 33:56.590]  Just stay on that side.
[33:56.870 --> 33:57.390]  There you go.
[33:57.650 --> 33:58.210]  That's bullshit!
[33:59.530 --> 34:00.570]  That's bullshit!
[34:07.390 --> 34:08.330]  Stupid monkey.
[34:13.310 --> 34:14.550]  The claw.
[34:18.370 --> 34:19.650]  Wow, 20?
[34:20.030 --> 34:20.670]  Thanks, Andrew.
[34:20.870 --> 34:21.190]  Boom!
[34:23.950 --> 34:26.070]  All right, turn six.
[34:27.110 --> 34:27.910]  What's Thwomp doing?
[34:28.290 --> 34:30.550]  Before you know it, we'll be almost halfway through.
[34:31.530 --> 34:32.790]  Can he take her back?
[34:35.570 --> 34:37.430]  Yeah, he can take her back if he passes you.
[34:38.210 --> 34:38.630]  Oh, yeah.
[34:39.150 --> 34:40.330]  The old yoink back.
[34:41.510 --> 34:45.030]  You just have to make a convincing argument why she's better off with you than with him.
[34:48.250 --> 34:48.990]  Where are you going?
[34:49.210 --> 34:49.550]  I don't know.
[34:49.790 --> 34:50.050]  He doesn't know.
[34:50.130 --> 34:50.790]  That's the whole point.
[34:51.370 --> 34:52.190]  Oh, wow.
[34:52.290 --> 34:54.330]  I would have taken Rosalina back if I was you, but...
[34:54.330 --> 34:56.550]  You got 50 fucking blocks of...
[34:57.290 --> 34:57.650]  Let's go.
[34:57.690 --> 34:58.370]  Oh, no.
[34:59.790 --> 35:00.750]  You still have to roll.
[35:00.890 --> 35:01.270]  You're okay.
[35:01.390 --> 35:02.130]  You still have to roll.
[35:02.330 --> 35:02.970]  Oh, my God.
[35:03.550 --> 35:05.870]  Nobs Long and Moist subscribed at tier one.
[35:07.570 --> 35:09.050]  Nobs Long and Moist.
[35:10.290 --> 35:10.930]  Way to go, Andrew.
[35:13.190 --> 35:14.850]  Might be looking at another 3v1.
[35:15.610 --> 35:16.570]  God damn it.
[35:16.890 --> 35:18.430]  What were you going for with the pipe?
[35:19.090 --> 35:20.810]  I was just trying to get anywhere else.
[35:21.030 --> 35:21.330]  Okay.
[35:21.970 --> 35:24.730]  I was so far away from the star, I was like, I might as well just go.
[35:25.350 --> 35:25.870]  Oh, wow.
[35:26.030 --> 35:26.750]  Who's he going to?
[35:27.570 --> 35:28.410]  Switch places.
[35:28.550 --> 35:29.030]  Oh, well.
[35:29.690 --> 35:30.210]  Hello.
[35:30.530 --> 35:31.110]  How are you?
[35:31.410 --> 35:32.590]  Hanging out with you down here.
[35:36.700 --> 35:37.840]  I'm scared of heights.
[35:38.860 --> 35:41.320]  Oh, buy some stuff?
[35:41.840 --> 35:43.040]  Close to Earth where I belong.
[35:43.980 --> 35:45.280]  Yes, I would like to buy something, please.
[35:46.400 --> 35:46.940]  I'll take you.
[35:49.280 --> 35:50.120]  Thank you.
[35:52.480 --> 35:53.000]  Mole.
[35:53.340 --> 35:53.960]  All right.
[35:55.540 --> 35:56.060]  Mole.
[35:57.220 --> 35:58.740]  I'm going to say mole my way over this way.
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.300]  I'm going to go this way now.
[36:01.500 --> 36:02.740]  Did you see if that was quicker?
[36:03.620 --> 36:03.860]  Nah.
[36:06.640 --> 36:07.540]  What am I doing?
[36:07.920 --> 36:08.380]  Nah, I didn't do that.
[36:08.400 --> 36:10.760]  You can trade your stamp for 10 coins if you want.
[36:11.100 --> 36:12.200]  No, I don't want to do that.
[36:14.560 --> 36:15.480]  I like my stamp.
[36:15.680 --> 36:16.760]  Yeah, I'm going to get all the stamps.
[36:22.740 --> 36:23.060]  Yeah!
[36:24.080 --> 36:24.620]  Oh, shit.
[36:24.680 --> 36:25.200]  I'm down here again.
[36:28.140 --> 36:30.480]  I have premarital Shreks.
[36:30.560 --> 36:31.280]  Oh, shit.
[36:33.540 --> 36:34.580]  Premarital Shreks.
[36:34.780 --> 36:37.180]  I have the Dodgers and Six probably.
[36:38.020 --> 36:38.880]  Premarital Shreks?
[36:42.500 --> 36:44.520]  That's an all-timer name, dude.
[36:44.660 --> 36:45.160]  That's awesome.
[36:45.760 --> 36:46.460]  Premarital Shreks is a good one.
[36:47.300 --> 36:48.800]  Congrats on your spumber status.
[36:49.360 --> 36:50.080]  Premarital Shrek.
[36:53.850 --> 36:56.130]  I don't like you guys getting all these good items.
[36:56.910 --> 36:57.670]  Not a fan.
[36:58.310 --> 36:58.990]  Yeah, not a fan.
[36:59.330 --> 37:01.650]  What are you a fan of?
[37:02.170 --> 37:03.550]  You guys getting bad items.
[37:06.610 --> 37:07.550]  That's interesting.
[37:08.390 --> 37:09.390]  Go get Rosalina.
[37:10.050 --> 37:10.910]  He's going to try.
[37:11.910 --> 37:13.430]  He will fail.
[37:16.970 --> 37:17.810]  What's this?
[37:18.330 --> 37:19.470]  Put your hand in the box.
[37:20.450 --> 37:21.010]  Raffle, baby.
[37:21.310 --> 37:22.530]  Hey, you bought one thing.
[37:23.210 --> 37:26.190]  If this was Fear Factor, it would be snakes and scorpions.
[37:27.890 --> 37:30.110]  You pulled once and did better than I did.
[37:30.350 --> 37:30.710]  Fifteen.
[37:31.170 --> 37:31.530]  Wow.
[37:33.170 --> 37:35.250]  Yeah, he got more than you on one.
[37:37.290 --> 37:38.210]  I feel bad.
[37:38.470 --> 37:39.230]  I do.
[37:40.690 --> 37:41.830]  Oh, wow, she can give you something.
[37:44.170 --> 37:45.410]  She's going to give you an ultimatum.
[37:45.810 --> 37:47.790]  She's like, I need to see some results here.
[37:47.850 --> 37:48.930]  You said you were on to something.
[37:49.150 --> 37:50.450]  You were headed somewhere in life.
[37:50.890 --> 37:52.510]  So far, we just seem to be floundering.
[37:52.530 --> 37:53.890]  Floundering around on a couple of blue circles.
[37:53.970 --> 37:54.830]  What does it do?
[37:54.930 --> 37:56.850]  Place up to two spaces ahead or behind to steal half your coins.
[37:56.850 --> 37:57.730]  If you land on it.
[37:57.770 --> 37:58.470]  Oh, wow.
[37:58.790 --> 38:00.170]  You give half your coins to Nick.
[38:01.230 --> 38:01.610]  Wow.
[38:02.030 --> 38:02.970]  I'm going to get rid of that.
[38:05.250 --> 38:06.290]  Now, what are you going to do?
[38:06.370 --> 38:07.370]  They're on your tail.
[38:08.670 --> 38:09.970]  Are you going to triple box it?
[38:10.270 --> 38:10.510]  Twenty-five.
[38:10.590 --> 38:11.130]  Oh, wow.
[38:11.170 --> 38:13.610]  Yeah, let's triple box and see if we can get to the star.
[38:14.590 --> 38:15.910]  Less than one block.
[38:16.050 --> 38:17.150]  Less than one block.
[38:18.210 --> 38:18.850]  Twenty-five.
[38:18.850 --> 38:19.730]  Two, two, three.
[38:19.970 --> 38:21.070]  Two, two, three.
[38:21.070 --> 38:23.230]  Two, two, three.
[38:23.630 --> 38:23.970]  Three.
[38:24.390 --> 38:25.310]  Two, two, three.
[38:25.510 --> 38:26.550]  Two, two, three.
[38:26.650 --> 38:27.490]  Two, three, three.
[38:28.950 --> 38:29.310]  Eight.
[38:29.570 --> 38:30.070]  My pin.
[38:34.310 --> 38:34.970]  God damn it.
[38:36.170 --> 38:37.110]  Oh, you can buy stuff.
[38:37.970 --> 38:39.550]  I mean, she's also probably going to give you an item, right?
[38:41.610 --> 38:41.970]  Maybe.
[38:46.840 --> 38:47.740]  Until the end.
[38:47.900 --> 38:48.180]  Okay.
[38:48.280 --> 38:49.100]  Until her next turn ends.
[38:50.400 --> 38:50.760]  That's...
[38:50.760 --> 38:51.260]  Thanks.
[38:51.260 --> 38:52.220]  That's what I want.
[38:52.960 --> 38:53.720]  Except with Prime.
[38:54.740 --> 38:55.540]  Thank you.
[38:55.800 --> 38:56.940]  Yeah, that'll come in handy later.
[38:57.460 --> 39:00.540]  Every time people say Prime, I think they're talking about Deion Sanders.
[39:01.880 --> 39:02.320]  Hell yeah.
[39:02.320 --> 39:03.680]  Thanks for subscribing with Coach Prime.
[39:04.300 --> 39:04.600]  Yeah.
[39:05.120 --> 39:06.780]  Classic Daisy using Coach Prime.
[39:06.880 --> 39:07.500]  Thank you so much.
[39:07.820 --> 39:09.800]  I hope you're doing better than Colorado is.
[39:11.600 --> 39:13.760]  A little less time on the Aflac commercials.
[39:14.080 --> 39:15.100]  Look, another stamp.
[39:15.500 --> 39:15.920]  That's fun.
[39:15.980 --> 39:16.900]  Oh, stamp me up.
[39:17.020 --> 39:17.860]  Dude, you're too stamped up.
[39:18.220 --> 39:19.420]  Got Hummie Nustard in here?
[39:20.040 --> 39:20.480]  Gangzog.
[39:23.480 --> 39:24.360]  Hummie Nustard.
[39:26.320 --> 39:27.740]  Subscribe for a whole trimester.
[39:27.980 --> 39:29.020]  Oh, wow.
[39:29.460 --> 39:30.380]  Item minigame?
[39:32.220 --> 39:32.800]  That's good.
[39:32.860 --> 39:34.400]  We need more stuff to slow this down.
[39:34.500 --> 39:34.880]  This is great.
[39:37.540 --> 39:38.780]  Stop the wheel.
[39:40.220 --> 39:41.180]  Start the wheel.
[39:41.620 --> 39:43.080]  You can go wherever you want, Nick.
[39:43.200 --> 39:45.120]  You can go however you want to do this thing.
[39:46.240 --> 39:46.580]  Okay.
[39:47.040 --> 39:48.320]  Is that what you...
[39:49.160 --> 39:49.900]  There you go.
[39:49.900 --> 39:52.880]  I see what it is now.
[39:54.360 --> 39:56.720]  Are you in control of whether it takes a turn or not?
[39:57.380 --> 39:57.640]  No.
[39:58.860 --> 40:01.020]  I think you can just wait 30 seconds.
[40:01.340 --> 40:02.480]  It just takes a long time.
[40:03.200 --> 40:03.760]  I don't want to.
[40:03.840 --> 40:04.680]  I'm going to get rid of that.
[40:04.760 --> 40:05.460]  That's the worst one.
[40:05.660 --> 40:05.780]  Great.
[40:06.940 --> 40:07.700]  Thanks for that.
[40:10.300 --> 40:11.200]  Oh, my God.
[40:12.340 --> 40:12.720]  Goddamn.
[40:12.900 --> 40:13.880]  Double? Holy shit.
[40:15.020 --> 40:16.220]  You're spoiled here, man.
[40:16.380 --> 40:18.360]  Oh, I'm just going to get rid of...
[40:19.900 --> 40:21.060]  Yeah, I paid for the other one.
[40:24.400 --> 40:25.880]  Interesting way to value it.
[40:26.300 --> 40:27.340]  Pick up all the shit he's dropped.
[40:27.340 --> 40:28.000]  Pick up all the crap.
[40:32.280 --> 40:33.140]  Monkey's in the chat.
[40:33.640 --> 40:34.020]  Nudge drop.
[40:34.700 --> 40:35.520]  Are we nudge dropping?
[40:36.960 --> 40:37.760]  Sunset standoff?
[40:39.240 --> 40:40.400]  They did something yesterday, I think.
[40:41.460 --> 40:43.620]  Andrew, we're going to get you.
[40:43.640 --> 40:46.380]  So a player flies the bomber bill toward the team sides.
[40:46.580 --> 40:47.660]  Oh, what the fuck?
[40:49.080 --> 40:49.440]  What?
[40:50.520 --> 40:53.880]  Oh, you have to steer left and right and everyone has to avoid you for five rounds.
[40:53.980 --> 40:56.420]  So let's just not all go the same way.
[40:56.900 --> 40:57.440]  Yeah, agreed.
[40:59.000 --> 40:59.360]  Okay.
[41:00.140 --> 41:00.800]  You got it.
[41:01.420 --> 41:02.780]  There's no jump? Come on.
[41:03.560 --> 41:05.300]  Are you going to jump into it or what?
[41:06.060 --> 41:06.760]  Go over it.
[41:07.820 --> 41:09.120]  Out of the way at the last second.
[41:09.740 --> 41:10.920]  All right, everybody stick to your side.
[41:12.520 --> 41:14.160]  I'm just going to stand in the middle and bait.
[41:14.660 --> 41:15.860]  Yeah, you'll never hit me here, Geoff.
[41:15.940 --> 41:16.680]  You'll never hit me.
[41:16.680 --> 41:17.740]  Baiting him.
[41:19.500 --> 41:20.140]  Anyway.
[41:20.460 --> 41:20.900]  Okay.
[41:21.700 --> 41:21.980]  Shit.
[41:22.860 --> 41:23.860]  Gavin, what?
[41:24.980 --> 41:26.200]  You can't get us both.
[41:28.740 --> 41:29.620]  Oh, nice!
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.380]  Or either of us.
[41:31.860 --> 41:33.400]  How many fucking times are we going to do this?
[41:35.080 --> 41:35.360]  Five.
[41:35.440 --> 41:35.660]  Five.
[41:36.460 --> 41:38.120]  It's like using a bullet bill ship.
[41:39.940 --> 41:40.680]  Oh, shit!
[41:42.060 --> 41:43.600]  You got baited, bro.
[41:50.560 --> 41:51.680]  Oh, wow!
[41:53.480 --> 41:54.940]  All right, Geoff, it's up to you.
[41:55.580 --> 41:56.080]  Here we go.
[41:56.960 --> 41:57.660]  You got this, Geoff.
[41:58.160 --> 41:59.180]  Oh, God, Geoff.
[41:59.300 --> 41:59.940]  For America.
[42:01.680 --> 42:02.240]  Oh!
[42:03.500 --> 42:04.380]  What happened, Andrew?
[42:05.540 --> 42:07.280]  I guess he'd just stay.
[42:07.960 --> 42:08.720]  America first.
[42:08.740 --> 42:11.940]  Beaver saves the day in America.
[42:13.300 --> 42:14.380]  Easy as that.
[42:15.200 --> 42:17.200]  Six more weeks to winner, bitch.
[42:21.340 --> 42:21.660]  Wow.
[42:24.380 --> 42:26.460]  A lot of people are so excited, they're going to spum.
[42:29.320 --> 42:30.560]  Guys, we're almost halfway.
[42:30.660 --> 42:31.260]  Oh, wow!
[42:31.700 --> 42:33.000]  That's the end of Rosalina.
[42:33.920 --> 42:34.240]  Bye!
[42:35.920 --> 42:36.980]  Should have put a ring on it.
[42:37.980 --> 42:38.660]  Yeah, you blew it, dude.
[42:39.420 --> 42:40.340]  Well, it's just a fling.
[42:41.060 --> 42:42.360]  But at least I took her from Andrew.
[42:43.040 --> 42:43.820]  Yeah, three.
[42:43.920 --> 42:45.060]  At least I ruined his relationship.
[42:45.300 --> 42:45.760]  Ooh, what's that?
[42:47.120 --> 42:48.680]  Getting to put my hand in the box again.
[42:48.680 --> 42:49.680]  Again? Both of them?
[42:51.280 --> 42:53.620]  I keep telling Andrew it's never going to be a wiener.
[42:53.780 --> 42:54.140]  Wait, what?
[42:54.460 --> 42:57.300]  You haven't bought anything since the last time you used it.
[42:57.640 --> 42:58.900]  Oh, bullshit!
[42:59.640 --> 43:01.920]  It's going to put me 1v3 again.
[43:02.180 --> 43:03.940]  Oh, yeah, it might.
[43:04.320 --> 43:05.300]  Yeah, you're green. It might.
[43:07.180 --> 43:07.900]  Oh, boy.
[43:09.960 --> 43:11.140]  Yeah, I'll use this. Why not?
[43:13.760 --> 43:15.140]  Yeah, I'll go with 10. No, sure.
[43:15.720 --> 43:18.500]  Suck down the shroom and roll a 10.
[43:19.460 --> 43:20.020]  Shit.
[43:20.600 --> 43:23.460]  I mean, you're close.
[43:25.540 --> 43:26.340]  Go downstairs.
[43:27.300 --> 43:28.040]  I don't want to.
[43:29.060 --> 43:29.760]  Why not?
[43:31.040 --> 43:33.060]  Oh, yeah, let's do some shop.
[43:41.510 --> 43:44.290]  Oh, you got one of those, too. Very nice.
[43:49.720 --> 43:50.620]  I've already got one.
[43:51.760 --> 43:54.400]  Oh, shit. 2v2. 2v2.
[43:54.500 --> 43:56.260]  It might be you and Andrew. The homies.
[43:58.300 --> 43:58.680]  No!
[44:01.240 --> 44:04.620]  That would have been sick if that was a star.
[44:05.540 --> 44:07.320]  Random bullshit in this map, isn't there?
[44:07.700 --> 44:08.940]  Well, we're not playing Pro Rules.
[44:12.440 --> 44:14.920]  That's what I think of when I think of Mario Party. Professionalism.
[44:15.400 --> 44:16.860]  Yeah, guys, this is just a friendly.
[44:17.260 --> 44:18.200]  Don't take it too seriously.
[44:19.380 --> 44:20.480]  For fuck's sake.
[44:20.620 --> 44:24.100]  This is to build a community between all of our nations.
[44:25.920 --> 44:26.700]  2-2-7.
[44:26.900 --> 44:30.120]  It's a great television show. Jack A. in it. Sherman Helmsley.
[44:31.300 --> 44:32.340]  Which way are you going?
[44:32.760 --> 44:33.920]  Up my anus.
[44:34.300 --> 44:35.160]  Going towards the star.
[44:35.820 --> 44:37.240]  I think that's away from the star, isn't it?
[44:37.240 --> 44:38.320]  I'm pretty sure it's away from the star, isn't it?
[44:38.320 --> 44:40.100]  I checked the two differences.
[44:40.520 --> 44:42.920]  Oh, I see. Oh, no, he's taking the yellow for two things.
[44:43.260 --> 44:45.340]  Oh, oh, oh, okay. And then you take the...
[44:46.140 --> 44:48.080]  He knows this mole.
[44:48.900 --> 44:49.880]  I do now.
[44:52.620 --> 44:53.480]  Yeah, right?
[44:53.840 --> 44:55.360]  Yeah, yeah, take me up.
[44:55.640 --> 44:57.320]  Because level three is where the...
[44:57.320 --> 44:58.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:58.420 --> 44:59.040]  Star is, okay.
[44:59.900 --> 45:02.400]  Assuming it doesn't just kick me left, which would suck.
[45:03.160 --> 45:04.620]  The monkey can't believe it.
[45:08.680 --> 45:09.240]  Whoa.
[45:10.220 --> 45:11.260]  Getting warm.
[45:11.700 --> 45:12.640]  And a stamp.
[45:13.580 --> 45:14.120]  Nice.
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.060]  Oh, this is gonna be a star.
[45:16.120 --> 45:17.260]  Oh, wow.
[45:17.740 --> 45:18.700]  I'll be a star.
[45:20.180 --> 45:21.520]  So many random blocks.
[45:26.920 --> 45:28.040]  Come on.
[45:28.560 --> 45:29.260]  Oh, yeah.
[45:29.440 --> 45:30.520]  Oh, here we go.
[45:30.860 --> 45:31.920]  2v2, the boys are back.
[45:32.380 --> 45:32.680]  We're fucked.
[45:33.140 --> 45:34.660]  The boys versus the men.
[45:35.720 --> 45:37.140]  Oh, prime cut.
[45:37.720 --> 45:38.540]  Oh, we...
[45:39.560 --> 45:41.280]  I don't know what that is.
[45:42.020 --> 45:43.620]  I think it's the steak cutting.
[45:43.840 --> 45:44.540]  Oh, my God.
[45:44.540 --> 45:47.900]  I think what you guys have to do is make it as close to 50-50 as you can.
[45:48.420 --> 45:52.360]  And you're working together to find where the perfect half is.
[45:53.380 --> 45:53.740]  Okay.
[45:53.860 --> 45:54.240]  Right here.
[45:54.540 --> 45:55.520]  So we want half volume.
[45:55.960 --> 45:56.320]  That's...
[45:56.320 --> 45:56.540]  Yeah.
[45:57.960 --> 45:59.220]  Oh, you can angle it, too.
[45:59.320 --> 45:59.500]  Interesting.
[45:59.500 --> 45:59.720]  Yeah.
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.020]  And you're trying to do it...
[46:01.020 --> 46:01.540]  Yeah, there you go.
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.960]  All right, Andrew, let's discuss this properly.
[46:05.560 --> 46:05.920]  Yeah.
[46:06.180 --> 46:08.500]  All right, Nick, we don't hit the button until we're ready, okay?
[46:09.080 --> 46:09.440]  Okay.
[46:09.440 --> 46:11.420]  We want to cut it perfectly in half.
[46:11.520 --> 46:12.480]  All right, I reckon like...
[46:12.480 --> 46:13.400]  I think right about here.
[46:13.860 --> 46:14.280]  You think so?
[46:14.960 --> 46:15.780]  Yeah, I think...
[46:16.420 --> 46:16.960]  You know what?
[46:17.020 --> 46:17.880]  I'll let you adjust.
[46:18.020 --> 46:19.540]  You like this?
[46:19.640 --> 46:20.040]  I like this.
[46:20.040 --> 46:20.640]  All right, here we go.
[46:21.600 --> 46:23.180]  Okay, there's one.
[46:24.740 --> 46:25.100]  Okay.
[46:25.560 --> 46:26.180]  Oh, this one.
[46:26.220 --> 46:27.060]  Let's just angle up.
[46:27.260 --> 46:28.200]  You go all the way right.
[46:28.440 --> 46:28.900]  You keep going.
[46:28.900 --> 46:29.400]  You keep going.
[46:29.540 --> 46:30.260]  You go that way.
[46:30.260 --> 46:30.540]  You go.
[46:30.740 --> 46:31.080]  Okay.
[46:31.280 --> 46:32.100]  Yeah, you go this way.
[46:32.300 --> 46:32.340]  A little bit.
[46:32.460 --> 46:33.280]  Swing all the way around.
[46:34.840 --> 46:35.280]  Like that?
[46:35.320 --> 46:35.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:35.780 --> 46:36.540]  Right there, right there.
[46:37.260 --> 46:37.520]  Okay, right?
[46:37.740 --> 46:38.040]  Pretty good.
[46:39.560 --> 46:40.340]  Not bad.
[46:42.000 --> 46:42.940]  Oh, shit.
[46:43.140 --> 46:43.520]  Oh, wow.
[46:44.100 --> 46:44.820]  I think it's your way.
[46:45.020 --> 46:45.920]  I think it's your way.
[46:46.140 --> 46:46.460]  You...
[46:46.460 --> 46:47.200]  Angle...
[46:47.200 --> 46:47.740]  There you go.
[46:47.820 --> 46:48.080]  Like that.
[46:48.080 --> 46:48.660]  A little bit more.
[46:48.740 --> 46:51.320]  Right about here.
[46:51.480 --> 46:51.800]  Do you like that?
[46:52.260 --> 46:52.840]  I like that.
[46:53.120 --> 46:53.340]  Right?
[46:54.060 --> 46:54.460]  Yeah.
[46:54.660 --> 46:55.060]  There we go.
[46:55.700 --> 46:56.260]  Oh, yeah.
[46:56.300 --> 46:56.880]  Cut this thing.
[46:57.280 --> 46:57.660]  Okay.
[46:58.160 --> 46:59.100]  That's the last reel.
[46:59.180 --> 47:00.300]  Let's see these steaks, boys.
[47:00.880 --> 47:02.360]  We'll see who's siblings and who's not.
[47:02.660 --> 47:03.060]  Wow!
[47:03.080 --> 47:03.240]  Tie!
[47:03.240 --> 47:03.560]  It's a tie!
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.540]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[47:07.040 --> 47:07.360]  No!
[47:08.880 --> 47:09.080]  No!
[47:11.400 --> 47:11.920]  No!
[47:14.220 --> 47:15.140]  It's a tie!
[47:16.140 --> 47:17.880]  There was no decider steak.
[47:18.780 --> 47:19.420]  What?
[47:19.440 --> 47:20.140]  It's a tie!
[47:20.460 --> 47:21.120]  We tied!
[47:21.260 --> 47:22.200]  We all won!
[47:22.360 --> 47:23.280]  We all won!
[47:24.300 --> 47:25.120]  Son of a bitch.
[47:25.160 --> 47:26.580]  They should have wheeled out a fourth steak.
[47:27.080 --> 47:28.100]  That is insane!
[47:28.560 --> 47:29.700]  How is that possible?
[47:30.980 --> 47:31.420]  Crazy.
[47:31.420 --> 47:33.740]  I don't think anyone's ever tied on one of these before.
[47:33.740 --> 47:34.420]  That's crazy!
[47:36.880 --> 47:37.200]  Wow!
[47:37.320 --> 47:38.760]  We got 50-50.
[47:38.820 --> 47:40.640]  They should have given us the win based on perfection.
[47:40.640 --> 47:42.140]  Yeah, that was pretty impressive.
[47:44.660 --> 47:44.980]  No.
[47:48.680 --> 47:52.750]  Where are we going?
[47:52.790 --> 47:54.990]  Man, those are some good-looking cuts of steak.
[47:55.110 --> 47:55.650]  Yeah, they were.
[47:55.790 --> 47:56.430]  Yeah, they were great.
[47:56.570 --> 47:57.170]  A little too good.
[47:59.430 --> 48:00.170]  I'll go this way.
[48:00.230 --> 48:01.170]  Gaming's come a long way.
[48:06.640 --> 48:08.600]  Alright, so how do I determine where I...
[48:09.360 --> 48:10.140]  16 to go.
[48:10.300 --> 48:11.240]  Yeah, 16 to go.
[48:13.180 --> 48:14.700]  That's how they split the company.
[48:19.060 --> 48:19.960]  Who's winning again?
[48:20.180 --> 48:20.800]  It's a Nick.
[48:21.240 --> 48:21.820]  Go to Nick!
[48:21.920 --> 48:23.040]  No, it's Gavin!
[48:23.040 --> 48:23.560]  Go to Nick!
[48:23.740 --> 48:24.340]  He's Mario!
[48:25.120 --> 48:25.980]  No, Gavin!
[48:28.640 --> 48:29.080]  Wow!
[48:30.520 --> 48:31.140]  Gammy dice.
[48:32.180 --> 48:33.200]  I'm just gonna undo it.
[48:33.740 --> 48:35.960]  Yeah, he knows how to shake it off.
[48:37.220 --> 48:38.720]  Making him use an item, though.
[48:38.940 --> 48:39.100]  Yeah.
[48:39.760 --> 48:40.540]  Yeah, you are.
[48:40.740 --> 48:43.000]  You're making me dip into the reserves that Rosalina's in.
[48:43.420 --> 48:46.160]  Where she left to ex-wife's reserves.
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.140]  Ah, she still has all of my guitars at her house.
[48:54.540 --> 48:55.460]  Yeah, okay, I don't give a shit.
[48:55.560 --> 48:56.040]  Take five coins.
[48:56.160 --> 48:57.420]  What do you think he does with the coins?
[48:58.380 --> 48:59.020]  Puts them in his hat.
[48:59.580 --> 49:00.800]  Saves them from being in the van.
[49:01.200 --> 49:03.680]  Nah, they go in the shell.
[49:05.560 --> 49:06.980]  Did I ever beat God of War?
[49:07.100 --> 49:09.280]  No, I haven't done that yet, NFT Steven.
[49:09.460 --> 49:10.720]  I'll get back to it eventually.
[49:11.280 --> 49:13.020]  We've just been so regulation busy.
[49:14.220 --> 49:15.320]  Been regulating hot.
[49:15.780 --> 49:17.040]  Yeah, hot regulating.
[49:17.960 --> 49:18.820]  To be regulated.
[49:19.500 --> 49:20.760]  Maybe I should pick up Ragnarok again.
[49:24.730 --> 49:25.490]  You're on the board?
[49:26.870 --> 49:27.490]  I am.
[49:28.950 --> 49:30.830]  I think you should finish Last of Us.
[49:31.950 --> 49:32.250]  Yeah!
[49:32.470 --> 49:32.770]  I will!
[49:32.770 --> 49:33.810]  Uh-oh.
[49:34.670 --> 49:35.990]  It's gonna take a little while.
[49:36.230 --> 49:37.090]  I assume so.
[49:37.790 --> 49:47.790]  After the stream yesterday, you asked what percentage of the game we were through, and I said 20, and Gavin's like, that might be generous.
[49:47.810 --> 49:49.030]  That might be liberal, yeah.
[49:49.410 --> 49:51.930]  Yeah, it might be an overestimation for where you were.
[49:52.750 --> 49:53.870]  Yeah, well, you know.
[49:55.110 --> 49:55.510]  Shit.
[49:55.670 --> 49:57.250]  Oh, that was the end of the statement, okay.
[49:58.770 --> 49:59.510]  Yeah, you know.
[49:59.510 --> 50:02.210]  Alright, you got Gammy Dice, what are you gonna do?
[50:02.850 --> 50:03.270]  You know.
[50:03.750 --> 50:04.150]  Ooh!
[50:04.450 --> 50:06.850]  That shop's only for last place.
[50:10.840 --> 50:11.900]  Yeah, canceled.
[50:12.400 --> 50:13.880]  And now, you're good.
[50:14.380 --> 50:15.440]  Do I...
[50:15.440 --> 50:16.800]  Now how many are you gonna do?
[50:17.740 --> 50:18.140]  Ten.
[50:18.320 --> 50:18.640]  Okay.
[50:19.480 --> 50:20.480]  Just go right past it.
[50:20.600 --> 50:22.580]  Unless you have to stop exactly on it, which would suck.
[50:24.120 --> 50:24.880]  Get your stamp.
[50:25.160 --> 50:26.020]  Wow, another stamp?
[50:26.640 --> 50:28.160]  Look at this.
[50:28.400 --> 50:30.360]  I am feeling good.
[50:32.300 --> 50:34.040]  Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[50:37.570 --> 50:38.530]  Yeah, I do.
[50:38.630 --> 50:39.490]  Oh, what if I'd hit no?
[50:45.130 --> 50:47.590]  We're about halfway and we're getting to 501.
[50:48.170 --> 50:49.010]  A lot's happening.
[50:49.230 --> 50:49.650]  Oh my lord.
[50:52.910 --> 50:54.490]  Where's the next star going to be?
[50:54.930 --> 50:55.650]  I'm on a mall.
[50:56.270 --> 50:58.170]  Oh, it's right in front of someone.
[50:58.510 --> 50:59.770]  Shit, Gavin is right next to it.
[51:03.450 --> 51:03.850]  Shite.
[51:05.710 --> 51:07.870]  There's a lot that can happen between now and my turn, though.
[51:08.350 --> 51:08.710]  Oh, balls!
[51:08.910 --> 51:09.170]  Oh, thank god.
[51:09.170 --> 51:09.610]  No, you're fine.
[51:10.030 --> 51:11.150]  You got whatever this is.
[51:11.210 --> 51:11.810]  What is this?
[51:12.370 --> 51:13.450]  Steal his money.
[51:14.790 --> 51:16.090]  We specialize in Boo Bells.
[51:16.170 --> 51:16.790]  Are you interested in...
[51:16.790 --> 51:17.470]  Yeah, why not?
[51:18.850 --> 51:19.630]  What does it do?
[51:20.050 --> 51:20.510]  Uh-oh.
[51:21.130 --> 51:21.390]  Nothing.
[51:21.470 --> 51:22.050]  Hold on, Boo?
[51:22.770 --> 51:23.730]  He's gonna buy it.
[51:23.950 --> 51:24.670]  Yeah, you should find out.
[51:25.430 --> 51:26.870]  Gives you, like, a tattoo or something.
[51:27.970 --> 51:28.510]  Oh, yeah.
[51:29.990 --> 51:30.770]  Gives you a tattoo.
[51:31.410 --> 51:33.410]  Gives you a tattoo for three turns.
[51:33.510 --> 51:34.010]  That's all it does.
[51:35.190 --> 51:35.790]  Oh, yeah?
[51:36.130 --> 51:36.490]  Yep.
[51:37.250 --> 51:38.250]  Does it hurt anybody else?
[51:38.510 --> 51:38.730]  Nope.
[51:39.650 --> 51:40.530]  Does it hurt Gavin?
[51:43.250 --> 51:43.610]  Hey!
[51:43.970 --> 51:44.670]  Oh, me and you, Geoff!
[51:45.030 --> 51:46.810]  Speaking of hurting Gavin, let's do it.
[51:48.110 --> 51:48.930]  Oh, we got this, Nick.
[51:49.750 --> 51:50.750]  Andrew, Nick, what's your team name?
[51:50.910 --> 51:51.390]  We got this.
[51:51.970 --> 51:52.550]  No bad ideas.
[51:53.330 --> 51:53.870]  No bad ideas.
[51:53.970 --> 51:54.250]  Oh!
[51:54.670 --> 51:55.110]  That's true.
[51:55.170 --> 51:55.530]  Reunited.
[51:55.570 --> 51:56.430]  Oh, my god.
[51:56.590 --> 51:58.590]  Oh, yeah, you gotta ground pound the fuses.
[51:59.890 --> 52:00.110]  Oh.
[52:00.250 --> 52:00.830]  Oh, wow.
[52:01.030 --> 52:01.350]  It's the same button.
[52:01.510 --> 52:02.630]  You squashed me!
[52:02.630 --> 52:03.110]  Okay.
[52:03.110 --> 52:04.030]  You can ground pound each other.
[52:04.190 --> 52:05.010]  Alright, hit it.
[52:05.690 --> 52:06.790]  Let's just stay on top of these.
[52:07.030 --> 52:07.230]  Shit.
[52:07.950 --> 52:08.150]  Alright.
[52:08.490 --> 52:09.150]  Frickin' things.
[52:10.390 --> 52:10.790]  Okay.
[52:11.110 --> 52:11.770]  Alright, we got this.
[52:11.810 --> 52:12.510]  We know how to do it.
[52:12.870 --> 52:13.270]  We got this.
[52:13.530 --> 52:14.970]  Everyone pick a side and go nuts.
[52:15.750 --> 52:16.650]  Gotta pound on.
[52:17.090 --> 52:17.490]  Alright.
[52:17.730 --> 52:18.410]  I'm gonna stick to the right here.
[52:18.410 --> 52:19.030]  I'll stay left.
[52:19.270 --> 52:19.950]  Or not.
[52:22.610 --> 52:23.010]  Nice!
[52:30.630 --> 52:33.030]  Dude, you guys are locked in.
[52:33.030 --> 52:34.390]  This is bullshit.
[52:35.210 --> 52:36.910]  This is such bullshit.
[52:36.910 --> 52:37.890]  Use my monkey butt!
[52:38.030 --> 52:39.050]  Geoff, go get the fuses!
[52:39.050 --> 52:40.170]  Use my monkey butt!
[52:40.750 --> 52:42.290]  Use that big ol' monkey butt!
[52:43.170 --> 52:44.470]  Use that monkey butt!
[52:46.130 --> 52:53.230]  Hey, when you guys get a chance when this VOD goes up, I want you to watch this part specifically and know that you got fucked.
[52:54.030 --> 52:56.810]  Were they ground pounding on the join between two?
[52:57.110 --> 52:58.510]  Oh, they were ground pounding.
[52:59.250 --> 53:01.250]  They didn't have to move.
[53:01.250 --> 53:05.270]  They locked in on a spot where they could just go up and down and that was it.
[53:05.450 --> 53:05.730]  Nothing.
[53:05.850 --> 53:06.690]  That was so easy.
[53:07.250 --> 53:08.790]  Geoff, that fuse got away from us.
[53:08.930 --> 53:09.750]  I panicked hard.
[53:09.910 --> 53:10.190]  Yeah.
[53:10.590 --> 53:11.710]  I'm not giving a fire.
[53:12.630 --> 53:13.250]  5-0-1!
[53:14.130 --> 53:15.090]  5-0-1, guys.
[53:15.390 --> 53:16.150]  Thanks for watching.
[53:16.350 --> 53:18.710]  There's still an hour left of this.
[53:19.290 --> 53:21.230]  Dildo Baggins with the gifted sub.
[53:22.490 --> 53:23.250]  Thanks, Dildo.
[53:23.770 --> 53:24.210]  Seven!
[53:25.270 --> 53:26.150]  Wow, nice.
[53:27.730 --> 53:30.270]  So, it says two hours for 15 turns.
[53:30.270 --> 53:31.850]  How long is a 50-turn game?
[53:32.350 --> 53:33.910]  I don't know if you can do 50 turns.
[53:34.170 --> 53:35.530]  It goes for a long time.
[53:36.790 --> 53:38.910]  What was it? 25 is what it is?
[53:39.070 --> 53:39.850]  Is it like the longest one?
[53:40.210 --> 53:40.750]  20, 25?
[53:41.430 --> 53:42.150]  I don't know.
[53:43.010 --> 53:44.770]  No! I hit the wrong button!
[53:45.050 --> 53:47.290]  Because the fucking enemy remote is so dumb!
[53:47.570 --> 53:47.890]  No!
[53:48.590 --> 53:49.030]  No!
[53:49.670 --> 53:50.770]  He didn't buy anything.
[53:51.490 --> 53:54.110]  I was about to buy a star steel spot!
[53:54.330 --> 53:55.550]  Yeah, he bought it.
[53:56.910 --> 53:57.750]  He blew it.
[53:59.390 --> 54:00.430]  He blew it.
[54:00.450 --> 54:04.130]  He had it, it was in his hand, and then he dropped it, and then he shit on it.
[54:04.270 --> 54:05.910]  He smashed it with his monkey butt.
[54:06.310 --> 54:10.330]  That was a star steel?
[54:10.570 --> 54:14.810]  I had two! You could throw two spaces of star steels?
[54:15.050 --> 54:15.230]  Yeah.
[54:15.550 --> 54:16.110]  Oh, fuck!
[54:16.670 --> 54:17.670]  Oh, like the traps?
[54:18.150 --> 54:18.390]  Yeah!
[54:19.090 --> 54:19.370]  Yeah.
[54:20.690 --> 54:21.610]  And then he blew it.
[54:21.910 --> 54:22.750]  I don't care!
[54:23.290 --> 54:23.650]  Wow!
[54:25.850 --> 54:28.350]  Oh shit, I gotta lock in everyone's... oh, fuck, okay.
[54:28.690 --> 54:29.930]  I thought it was a 1v1.
[54:30.210 --> 54:30.350]  Wow!
[54:30.590 --> 54:31.070]  Oh, man!
[54:31.810 --> 54:34.150]  Oh, that was incredible! Holy shit!
[54:34.890 --> 54:37.090]  Core ham, but thanks for the pribes up!
[54:39.950 --> 54:41.030]  Stupid fucking game.
[54:43.870 --> 54:44.470]  Oh, shit!
[54:46.370 --> 54:47.770]  How do you... move?
[54:47.770 --> 54:49.430]  I think you just go up and... well, you don't do that.
[54:51.550 --> 54:52.090]  Andrew's out.
[54:52.750 --> 54:53.310]  Andrew's done.
[54:53.690 --> 54:55.190]  Wait, what does this... what happens with this?
[54:56.910 --> 54:57.550]  It starts...
[54:57.550 --> 54:58.890]  So, okay, you just walk? Okay.
[55:01.390 --> 55:02.890]  Okay, here we go!
[55:03.570 --> 55:04.590]  Good luck, everybody!
[55:05.090 --> 55:07.370]  Don Tony's subscriber prize! Thanks, son!
[55:08.770 --> 55:09.510]  Thank you!
[55:12.870 --> 55:14.790]  You're not gonna catch me, you shy little bastards!
[55:17.290 --> 55:19.470]  It's just run, right? There's no other button?
[55:19.670 --> 55:20.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:20.190 --> 55:21.130]  Yeah, as far as I can tell.
[55:21.130 --> 55:25.270]  And then you can... I mean, you can probably, like, try... try, like, zoning each other out or whatever.
[55:27.430 --> 55:29.270]  I wish I was a bigger character for that.
[55:30.630 --> 55:31.210]  Monkey butt.
[55:31.970 --> 55:33.230]  Yeah, I call this the ape escape.
[55:37.490 --> 55:37.870]  Uh-oh.
[55:37.930 --> 55:38.190]  Oh!
[55:39.510 --> 55:39.930]  Uh-oh.
[55:40.010 --> 55:40.330]  Woof!
[55:41.010 --> 55:41.990]  Everybody's doing little balls.
[55:42.410 --> 55:43.150]  They're hot on my ass!
[55:43.930 --> 55:45.790]  Oh, goodness.
[55:45.930 --> 55:46.590]  A collective ass!
[55:46.610 --> 55:46.830]  No!
[55:46.930 --> 55:48.430]  Oh, there goes Andrew!
[55:48.610 --> 55:48.970]  Fuck!
[55:50.150 --> 55:51.590]  You didn't want the 20 coins, right?
[55:53.070 --> 55:54.350]  I didn't want any of it.
[55:54.430 --> 55:54.730]  Oh, shit.
[55:54.910 --> 55:55.130]  How do I punch?
[55:55.530 --> 55:57.070]  What the hell is this?
[55:58.230 --> 55:59.130]  It's Doom!
[56:01.070 --> 56:01.270]  Oh!
[56:01.510 --> 56:02.070]  Oh!
[56:03.950 --> 56:05.330]  Why am I so behind?
[56:05.850 --> 56:06.850]  Oh, balls! You better keep running!
[56:08.130 --> 56:09.610]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
[56:14.160 --> 56:14.720]  Ah!
[56:15.220 --> 56:16.120]  Oh, no!
[56:16.480 --> 56:16.800]  Yes!
[56:18.140 --> 56:20.880]  Dude, that was nipping up my aim!
[56:23.080 --> 56:25.080]  The Mario-Wario connection.
[56:26.140 --> 56:28.140]  Damn, that's like 40 coins each, right?
[56:28.920 --> 56:29.960]  It's gotta be, right?
[56:32.140 --> 56:32.280]  Oh!
[56:33.060 --> 56:33.680]  Divvy.
[56:35.300 --> 56:35.920]  Oh.
[56:36.320 --> 56:36.720]  Got a couple.
[56:37.560 --> 56:37.880]  Nice!
[56:37.900 --> 56:38.120]  Great!
[56:41.320 --> 56:41.940]  Oh!
[56:45.760 --> 56:46.580]  And it's gone!
[56:50.440 --> 56:51.280]  Money mole.
[56:51.280 --> 56:53.040]  Suddenly, I'm 40 away now.
[56:53.360 --> 56:53.680]  Great.
[56:55.080 --> 56:55.260]  Ah!
[57:00.020 --> 57:00.420]  Okay.
[57:03.420 --> 57:04.020]  Let's see.
[57:04.040 --> 57:04.140]  Oh!
[57:04.440 --> 57:05.260]  Oh, it's stamp time.
[57:06.160 --> 57:06.460]  Thank you!
[57:07.980 --> 57:08.620]  Thank you!
[57:10.900 --> 57:12.780]  Put that back in my little pouch.
[57:14.700 --> 57:15.480]  Oh, what's this?
[57:15.560 --> 57:15.960]  Oh!
[57:16.160 --> 57:16.900]  Oh, hello!
[57:17.580 --> 57:17.860]  What's that?
[57:18.220 --> 57:18.640]  Golden Goomb?
[57:18.680 --> 57:18.920]  Hello!
[57:19.420 --> 57:20.420]  Is this the full gold shop?
[57:20.940 --> 57:21.420]  Oh, no.
[57:21.420 --> 57:22.720]  Oh, is it gonna have a golden pipe?
[57:22.720 --> 57:22.920]  What?
[57:23.940 --> 57:24.320]  Oh!
[57:26.120 --> 57:26.620]  Wow!
[57:29.560 --> 57:31.260]  Geoff, make sure you hit the right buttons.
[57:34.600 --> 57:35.100]  Wow!
[57:35.180 --> 57:36.460]  Take it from a man who's been there.
[57:36.720 --> 57:38.900]  Huge, huge move.
[57:39.100 --> 57:40.000]  I didn't even look.
[57:43.540 --> 57:45.340]  I wish you could use that right now.
[57:45.640 --> 57:47.120]  Nintendo Gold just looks good.
[57:47.920 --> 57:48.540]  It does!
[57:50.080 --> 57:51.000]  I agree with that.
[57:54.080 --> 57:56.600]  What if you poisoned yourself there?
[57:57.580 --> 57:58.840]  More than one space.
[58:00.420 --> 58:00.860]  What does this do?
[58:01.060 --> 58:01.460]  Chance time.
[58:01.480 --> 58:02.280]  Why are you viewing the board?
[58:03.600 --> 58:03.920]  Eight.
[58:04.240 --> 58:05.300]  What are you doing?
[58:05.900 --> 58:06.620]  He's viewing the board.
[58:06.620 --> 58:07.480]  He's just going forward.
[58:08.260 --> 58:11.140]  He's looking at the spaces where everything's at.
[58:13.200 --> 58:14.720]  Instead of just putting...
[58:15.600 --> 58:16.500]  Wait, was it eight or nine?
[58:17.760 --> 58:18.020]  What?
[58:19.080 --> 58:19.920]  It doesn't...
[58:19.920 --> 58:20.280]  Star?
[58:20.620 --> 58:21.460]  Oh, my God.
[58:21.460 --> 58:22.280]  You guys are insane.
[58:23.500 --> 58:25.760]  Gavin is looking past the star to be like,
[58:25.820 --> 58:27.080]  Okay, so what's after that?
[58:27.160 --> 58:28.340]  What else can I get on this turn?
[58:28.440 --> 58:29.140]  It's good thinking.
[58:30.660 --> 58:31.300]  Hit it now.
[58:34.380 --> 58:36.560]  That was weird. It was on five for a really long time.
[58:36.980 --> 58:38.060]  It really was.
[58:40.580 --> 58:41.240]  Don't do it.
[58:41.500 --> 58:42.160]  He did it.
[58:44.440 --> 58:45.920]  I wonder what this...
[58:45.920 --> 58:47.620]  What do you think the Boo Bell does, Nick?
[58:48.080 --> 58:49.080]  I don't know. Let's find out.
[58:49.260 --> 58:49.540]  You want to?
[58:49.860 --> 58:50.960]  I guess I'll get a cool tattoo.
[58:50.960 --> 58:52.620]  Yeah. Oh, wow.
[58:53.220 --> 58:53.660]  Temporary.
[58:53.900 --> 58:55.080]  For three turns, though.
[58:55.380 --> 58:55.580]  Yep.
[58:56.220 --> 58:57.440]  Let's see where the next star is.
[58:57.840 --> 58:59.040]  Oh, shit. Look at that.
[58:59.140 --> 59:01.020]  Oh, for Christ's sake.
[59:01.860 --> 59:02.820]  This is some bullshit.
[59:02.920 --> 59:03.600]  Well, at least Geoff can...
[59:03.600 --> 59:05.140]  I should have rolled a fricking ten.
[59:09.520 --> 59:10.900]  Oh, my God.
[59:13.220 --> 59:13.660]  Oh.
[59:14.260 --> 59:15.080]  What is this?
[59:16.020 --> 59:16.420]  No.
[59:16.760 --> 59:17.200]  Whoa.
[59:17.640 --> 59:18.000]  No.
[59:18.500 --> 59:19.460]  No, this is bull...
[59:19.460 --> 59:20.200]  No, don't you...
[59:20.200 --> 59:20.280]  Wow.
[59:20.280 --> 59:22.880]  You can steal a star and then buy a star.
[59:25.980 --> 59:27.480]  Nick is like walking away.
[59:27.720 --> 59:29.020]  I think I just lost Nick.
[59:29.780 --> 59:35.340]  I heard Archie come in, so I had to close the door so he wouldn't hear me yelling at you for stealing my fucking star.
[59:36.220 --> 59:38.540]  Yeah, I'm sure your kid didn't hear that.
[59:40.500 --> 59:45.660]  Well, as long as this chance type doesn't take stars into account, this should be a pretty good turn.
[59:45.760 --> 59:47.020]  Oh, and he got the...
[59:47.020 --> 59:47.380]  Oh.
[59:48.900 --> 59:49.700]  This is...
[59:49.700 --> 59:50.800]  Jesus Christ.
[59:53.860 --> 59:55.420]  I should have rolled a ten, idiot.
[59:56.140 --> 59:57.140]  Oh, does that send you the...
[59:57.140 --> 59:57.520]  Yeah!
[59:59.380 --> 59:59.780]  What?
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.100]  Oh, he's doing the chance type.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:01.320]  He's in the clouds, baby.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.860]  What the fuck is this all about?
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.380]  Oh, no.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:05.780]  Oh, yes!
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.780]  He was hoping that he was gonna get star...
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.620]  Like, oh, he's gonna, like, steal a star.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.000]  Now he can only lose a star.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.540]  All right, let's do...
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.880]  Let's do 30 coins, maybe.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.700]  I could do with some money. I just spent a lot of money on this star.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.480]  Close your eyes. Close your eyes.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.440]  Close your eyes and we'll tell you when.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:22.860]  Now.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:24.420]  Okay.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.860]  Not me. Not me. Not me. Not me.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.500]  Anyone but me. Okay, me. Me. Me. Me.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.580]  Not me. Not me. Not me. Not me. Not me.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.540]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.380]  Oh, Wario gets 20 coins!
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:36.740]  Shit!
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:37.700]  To Wario!
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.260]  Yeah, what a great change.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.880]  Get richer. All right.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.460]  Well, now he can't afford...
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:45.240]  He stole my...
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.720]  Yeah, but now he can't afford the star.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.260]  Quick, give me 19 coins somewhere.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.580]  Boobow, boobow, boobow, boobow, boobow.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.160]  Boobow, boobow, boobow, boobow, boobow.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.640]  Call on Boo. Call on Boo. Call on Boo.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.440]  I can't wait to find out what happens.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.460]  He's gonna take my shit, isn't he?
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.380]  I can't afford a star.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.300]  Hey, what do you want to nab?
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.020]  You can steal a star.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.380]  Why did you do that?
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.020]  You did...
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.640]  What are you doing?
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.920]  You're a moron!
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.980]  I didn't do it.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.400]  It's fine.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.040]  Oh my god.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.060]  Here's why you shouldn't do this, right?
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.700]  Retaliation is childish.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.600]  Do it.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.020]  Goo goo ga ga.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.100]  I mean...
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.480]  The chat just immediately...
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.720]  What is wrong with you?
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.080]  So fucking scared right now.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.140]  You just shit your star out.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.280]  So instead...
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:39.580]  Oh my god.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.700]  On that last turn, instead of getting two stars, I spent 70 coins on nothing.
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.140]  Yup.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.120]  I still get a turn.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:49.620]  Oh my god.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.140]  Let's see.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.160]  Son of a bitch.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.740]  Oh, wow.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.100]  Oh, he's moving.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.000]  That's huge.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:57.540]  And look at this.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.220]  Oh, I thought you were gonna land.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.500]  What are they freaking out about?
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.240]  I just hit a button.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:03.880]  It's fine.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.320]  Jerks.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:04.680]  So dumb.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.260]  So dumb.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:07.820]  What the fuck?
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.060]  To even go to the coin one there?
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.480]  Even on purpose.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.140]  Insane.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.680]  It stunts on the coin one, doesn't it?
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.480]  Let me tell you.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.040]  I didn't see two options to the right.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.000]  I have bad eyesight.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.080]  Fuck you.
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.140]  Eat shit.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:22.960]  Go to hell.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:23.920]  Fuck off.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.480]  Sweet. I'm ready.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.260]  Okay.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.240]  What the fuck?
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:33.700]  Anyway.
[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:39.110]  Thanks for the star.
[01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:42.290]  Never know how to fucking hold this controller.
[01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.050]  Sometimes it's vertical, sometimes it's not.
[01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.930]  It tells you.
[01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:47.690]  It tells you specifically how to hold it.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.460]  You okay, man?
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:02:59.960]  Okay.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.580]  I went to the bull.
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.600]  Geoff had no idea.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.280]  Geoff had no clue.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.340]  Geoff looks at what everyone else did and he's like,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.200]  I got it.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:13.760]  Me too.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.120]  I knew.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.040]  I knew.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:16.420]  I did.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:16.720]  I did.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.020]  All right.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.380]  Let's see.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.560]  What the fuck?
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.690]  What in the goddamn...
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.080]  There it is.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.620]  Yeah, but what's the...
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.140]  Ooh.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.260]  Oh, that's...
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.500]  Goddamn it.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.000]  Way to go, Geoff.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.700]  Good job, Geoff.
[01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.220]  I didn't do the right amount of remembering.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.260]  Ah, yeah.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.530]  We're so locked in.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.140]  Doing word association.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:18.660]  Ooh.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:21.960]  Fuck.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.080]  Fuck.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:24.680]  Yeah.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.820]  That was it.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:26.900]  Ooh, nice job.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.460]  Oh, a tie!
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.160]  That's good, I need the coins.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.760]  Goddamn it!
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.640]  I kept losing my marker on the selection.
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.400]  I'd end up bottom left away from everything.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.180]  Andrew in shambles.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.780]  I'm just on tilt.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.620]  Ever since I lost those star spaces.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.020]  It's been all bad.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.220]  Ooh.
[01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.650]  Wow.
[01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:59.850]  I could just sniff that star.
[01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:01.210]  I'm not gonna get it.
[01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:02.490]  I want it, though.
[01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.430]  Oh, cheapsies?
[01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:06.050]  Uh-oh.
[01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.690]  Nice.
[01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:08.670]  It's time for a flash sale, boys.
[01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:09.530]  Luigi!
[01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:11.190]  What's Lugia doing here?
[01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:12.990]  The jamboree buddy.
[01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:14.090]  Huh.
[01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:16.390]  What's he gonna do, suck up some ghosts?
[01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.690]  Uh.
[01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.570]  Easier time getting 10s?
[01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:20.090]  Holy shit.
[01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.670]  Monkey Kong's fucking right there, look at that.
[01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:25.170]  Ooh.
[01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:28.770]  Can't wait for somebody else to steal him.
[01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.490]  What if his name was Dilkong?
[01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:38.010]  You want his name to be Dilkong?
[01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.530]  What if we just rename him Dilkong from here on out?
[01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.790]  Yeah, I mean, honestly, what if, I guess.
[01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:46.590]  Sounds like an illness.
[01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:50.630]  Oh, I gotta fucking fight for the right for him to be stolen.
[01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:51.670]  Yeah, you don't remember that?
[01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.890]  Goddammit.
[01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:52.570]  Yeah.
[01:05:53.970 --> 01:06:02.130]  I was really proud of Gus this morning, guys, because he used, instead of using the T word, he used rubbish.
[01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:03.370]  Wow.
[01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.590]  Yeah, he knew.
[01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.730]  He knew.
[01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:09.110]  Henry Dilkong.
[01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:13.410]  What are we doing here?
[01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:17.590]  Oh, Luigi's such a baby.
[01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:21.150]  Yeah, you tell him, Nick.
[01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:23.810]  Solve the puzzles.
[01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:26.710]  Oh, this is gonna be everyone's.
[01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:27.450]  What do you want from me?
[01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:29.270]  Luigi's trapped in the mansion.
[01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:32.570]  Alright, I got it.
[01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:37.030]  I don't really understand, but I don't care, so hit yes.
[01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:39.970]  How do I put the fucking picture down after I pick it up?
[01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:41.690]  You gotta, you put it on the wall.
[01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:42.570]  You go up to the wall.
[01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:44.550]  Oh, it goes on the wall.
[01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:45.110]  Yeah.
[01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.330]  That's, uh, yeah.
[01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:49.430]  Yeah, okay.
[01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.830]  That was the clarity I needed.
[01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.830]  Oh my god, there's like eight rooms.
[01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:54.950]  And then, wow, Andrew has the advantage?
[01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:57.890]  Oh, Andrew starts with the first one solved.
[01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.630]  Go, Andrew, go!
[01:06:58.770 --> 01:06:59.150]  Run!
[01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.210]  Run, Andrew, go!
[01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:02.870]  Go, go, go, go.
[01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:06.710]  Andrew, you suck, jump!
[01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:12.630]  Fuck, I put the wrong piece up.
[01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.030]  Go, Eeps, go! Go, Eep, go!
[01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:16.170]  Go, go, go.
[01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.410]  Geoff, put the bomb...
[01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:19.670]  I was laughing too much, I didn't go through.
[01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:25.050]  I just ran over and immediately picked up the wrong piece and didn't know how to put it down.
[01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:30.550]  I can't, I can't put it down, am I fucked?
[01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:34.510]  He put the bomb down!
[01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:37.510]  Geoff's still in the first room.
[01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:39.430]  Not for long.
[01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:40.750]  What the fuck?
[01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:45.630]  Oh, great, babe, what are you doing?
[01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.510]  I don't know what to do!
[01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.390]  Push the barrel!
[01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:49.450]  Clear the path!
[01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.070]  One, two!
[01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:52.430]  Oh, I see.
[01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:53.370]  You're catching up!
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.300]  Get me out of it.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.900]  How's it going, Geoff?
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.240]  He's a kid.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.980]  I don't know what I do with it after I find the odd one out.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.020]  Complete the picture, this is a tough one.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.280]  You got this, you got it, you got it.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.440]  There you go, there you go.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:12.100]  You got it.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:14.680]  Okay.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:15.840]  There we go.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:16.940]  What? Insane!
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:17.940]  Insane, Andrew!
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:18.720]  Andrew, what the hell?
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.640]  What are you doing?
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.620]  I'm an idiot.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:22.560]  What are you doing?
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:26.760]  What?
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.380]  Are you kidding?
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.140]  Is this a joke?
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:29.880]  What?
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.380]  I see what he did and it's okay.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.380]  You blew it!
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.800]  You blew it!
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.080]  No!
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.340]  You blew it!
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.020]  I don't play Mario games!
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.360]  You blew it!
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.820]  Why would that be the thing?
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.720]  Why would that be it?
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.660]  God damn it!
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.740]  Oh my God!
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.380]  You blew it!
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.820]  I'm gonna shit my pants.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.900]  Piece of shit.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.100]  You blew it!
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.300]  Oh my God!
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.280]  I hate this game.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.560]  Oh, come on!
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.120]  Move, you frickin' moron!
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.200]  You silly sausage!
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.920]  Why the odd one out?
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.640]  What do you think the odd one out is?
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:21.680]  Look at them!
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.860]  Which one doesn't match?
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.680]  What the fuck's happening here?
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.460]  Piece of shit.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.640]  Oh my God!
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.100]  Piece of garbage.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.160]  What am I doing?
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.100]  I suck!
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.580]  Get me back out!
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.960]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.380]  I'm putting my puzzle together, I think.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.160]  He's doing it the same way Andrew did it!
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.620]  It's the same!
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.020]  He blew it the same way!
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.800]  100%!
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.900]  You're making me forget everything!
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:00.720]  Shut up!
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.260]  I don't know what to do.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:09.960]  He did it exactly the same!
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.360]  It's cause Andrew and I think alike.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.680]  Oh my God!
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.600]  Everybody shut the fuck up!
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.020]  What do you mean shut the fuck up? You're nailing the final piece, why do we need to be quiet when you're done?
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.180]  You don't say shut the fuck up and just win!
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.180]  That makes no sense, Nick!
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.240]  Shut the fuck up so we can watch you win?
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.900]  Everybody shut the fuck up and the door's open!
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.240]  Why?
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.680]  Every time I looked up at Geoff and Andrew's pictures, I laughed so much I forgot what I was doing.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.780]  I've been concentrating on Eric being like, he did it the same way!
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.220]  Oh my God, it's so funny!
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:50.620]  He did it the same way!
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.040]  That was legitimately the funniest thing I think we've ever done as a company.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.880]  I cannot believe that.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.720]  My turn isn't over!
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.780]  I think Geoff and Andrew fucking up the exact same way was so funny.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.640]  Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.020]  Oh, my stomach hurts so much.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.340]  My stomach fucking hurts so bad.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.960]  Oh my God.
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.160]  Oh, that was so fucking funny.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.060]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.220]  Nick, I can see the patterns on the keyboard because I had tears in my eyes.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.900]  I don't see it here, dude.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.400]  I just couldn't think.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.640]  Video games are fucking dumb.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:40.040]  My fucking throat hurts from laughing so hard.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.640]  This fucking rat's gonna get it, dude.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.940]  Christ almighty.
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.920]  I don't think I can eat this one!
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.780]  I'll take it.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.180]  I'll take it, yeah, sure.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.340]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.320]  I got it for a half off, too. It's even better.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:07.280]  He nicked my cheap star! I spent 70 bucks getting that!
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:10.400]  I'm in pain from laughing so hard.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.340]  Dude, what the fuck?
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.180]  This is so funny.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.800]  Oh, my God.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.900]  It's never near me!
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.920]  Just played a constant game of Other Side of the Mall.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.700]  Why do you need it to be near you? Don't you have, like, Luigi?
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.600]  Oh, no, Nick has Luigi. Never mind, I'm sorry.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.980]  I'm in dead last! That's why!
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.600]  I'm sorry, I thought you had Luigi.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.500]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.320]  I can't breathe, fuck me!
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.440]  Geoff, hit a button.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.560]  Oh, my God, I can't. Hold on, sorry, I was looking at my phone.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.700]  Answer the text. Oh, my God.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.300]  TWO HOURS, GEOFF!
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.100]  Let's see, which way do I want to go?
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.900]  Where's the star? He's upstairs.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.160]  PICK ANYWHERE!
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.920]  TWO HOURS!
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.460]  No, I think I'll stay.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.700]  Oh, it's a minigame.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.880]  Alright, more minigames.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.960]  Oh, just as easy as that.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.360]  Oh, good.
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:20.140]  Oh, man, I can still sniff that star that was there.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.460]  You can't because there's only 11 away!
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.460]  It's always right in front of you!
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.140]  Annoying time to roll the 2.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.440]  You're right there with Geoff. You and Geoff hang out.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:35.660]  Give me gold pipe!
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.460]  He just extended his time to the star, by the way.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.600]  It went from 11 to 20.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.620]  Oh, is that right?
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.760]  Did I have to go down?
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.040]  Yes, you did.
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.320]  Yes, you did.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.640]  Look at these fucking dweebs.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.000]  Red and green.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.880]  You should have dropped that coin thing.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:58.200]  Oh, yeah, I should do that soon.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.320]  Yeah, fucking losers.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.460]  Pulling hands, walking one.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.640]  Oh, you piece of shit!
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.320]  Oh!
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.080]  Hey, don't worry, it's 10.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:10.240]  Isn't that awesome?
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.320]  His name is on the box!
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.740]  Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.080]  Way to go, Luigi!
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.320]  Luigi Mario!
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.500]  Oh, it's the brothers!
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.480]  Look at that, you already have a stamp, too. Isn't that fun?
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.180]  Look, and you can buy stuff.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.660]  Oh, that's perfect.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:31.700]  This is so exciting.
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.920]  Oh, you can buy it for cheap.
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.420]  You can buy it for cheap.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.980]  You can slow down Andrew.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.120]  You can speed up.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.860]  No need for that!
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.260]  Throwing a fucking spike trap in front of a car with no wheels.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.400]  What are you doing?
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.280]  Oh, you gonna get anything else? Yeah, why not, right?
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.820]  Yeah, get two of the same.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.140]  Yep.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.640]  I'm having a lot of fun, I don't know about you.
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:04.600]  Uh, yeah.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.580]  Yeah, you're five away.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:08.700]  Oh, sweet.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.500]  We should do this again.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.060]  Oh, I'm thrilled with how this is going.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:14.520]  This is great.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.260]  Oh, you get a fucking mushroom, too.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.260]  You piece of shit.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:19.960]  Oh, another mushroom!
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.180]  Ah!
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.280]  I'm gonna get rid of that one.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.000]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, get rid of it.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:26.400]  Who needs it?
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.340]  Throw it on the ground. This is garbage.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.660]  Oh, god damn it.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:32.800]  What's this?
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.340]  Oh, do it.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.140]  I mean, hell yeah.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.860]  Use it on me next turn.
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.060]  Sounds like fun.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.240]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.160]  Just a half.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.960]  Why not, right? Flash shields overkill.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:49.540]  Just sad.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:51.940]  Oh, there they go.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:54.140]  What are you doing? Why are you hitting buttons?
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.760]  I was just trying to skip it.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.980]  What if the game crashed at that point?
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.000]  Andrew would be thrilled.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.140]  Then we would've got the ten turns that you wanted.
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.640]  Oh, it's everyone against Mario? Oh, no.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:09.840]  Oh, well, no.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.760]  I'm voting for Donkey Kong on this one.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.240]  I think Donkey Kong's got this in the bag.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.520]  You mean Dil-Kong?
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.140]  Sorry, Henry Dil-Kong.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.320]  Henry Dil-Kong.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.760]  Henry Dil-Kong.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.780]  Oh, my god.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.760]  Oh, my god.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.360]  Could you...
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.800]  Alright, team, spread out.
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.740]  This one sucks for us.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.740]  Come on, Dil-Kong, let's go.
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:39.800]  Oh, no.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.400]  Oh, my god.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.740]  He's going for Dil-Kong.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.280]  Dil-Kong, run!
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.020]  Oh, my fucking TV went off!
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.380]  My TV went off!
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.080]  No!
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.040]  I can't see!
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.620]  It doesn't matter, it froze!
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:02.940]  It's over!
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.000]  Oh, no.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:06.760]  That's back!
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.340]  Andrew's been disconnected!
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.960]  Can he get back in?
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.960]  Who am I in the game with? Who's this?
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.100]  Who are you?
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.180]  Kill Dil-Kong!
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.260]  Kill Dil-Kong!
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.060]  It's Ghost of Dil-Kong.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.120]  Move, you idiot!
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.060]  Who was Dil-Kong?
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.860]  Andrew, are you still here?
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.340]  Oh, no!
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.560]  Andrew's gone. Guys, that might be the game.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.400]  Did he yank the power
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.240]  on his router?
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.020]  Did Andrew switch over?
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.780]  That might be it, boys.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.460]  He should be able to
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.760]  rejoin, though.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:49.580]  Is that right?
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.220]  Is that how it goes? I don't know.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.380]  But he's next, isn't he?
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.060]  Let's see.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:57.720]  Let's check the standings.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.420]  Big smile!
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:01.440]  I couldn't see
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.460]  before he left.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.640]  My TV...
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.160]  I wonder if he lost power.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.100]  How did we hear him after he lost power?
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.640]  I don't know. Maybe he lost it in phases.
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.280]  Maybe he has
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.860]  a five-second battery backup
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:18.660]  on just his mic.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.560]  Choose an event, you stupid rat!
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:24.740]  Just enough bits.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.280]  Okay.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:27.600]  Oh, God.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.580]  Oh, God.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.760]  This is awesome.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:35.540]  Andrew is
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.020]  gone.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.180]  He's not saying anything on Slack.
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.960]  I don't want to play with Adam.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.220]  I want to play with the ghost of Dilkon.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:43.800]  No.
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.120]  Oh, no!
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.580]  It's just going to go for him?
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.220]  Pause it.
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:54.780]  Pause it.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.120]  This sucks!
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:57.120]  Damn!
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.420]  Unless his voice disconnected
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:01.240]  and he's playing.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.740]  I don't think he is.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.360]  I think it's because it lets you finish.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.360]  What's that?
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.620]  It lets you finish instead of
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.120]  just ending.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.080]  But that's not what we want.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.780]  Yeah, that's not fair
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:17.320]  to Dilkon.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.760]  What if we just keep it paused here,
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.780]  hang out with the chat for like...
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.720]  Just a couple minutes
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.560]  and see if he comes back.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.000]  And if he doesn't, we'll just call it right here.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.920]  Maybe he just really wanted to do 10-10.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.360]  Yeah, I think he did.
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:34.740]  When he yelled
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.400]  my TV turned off, I can't see,
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:37.340]  that was really special.
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.300]  It's like he lost image and then in panic
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.560]  kicked his internet out.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.840]  I don't know how we got that in stages.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.900]  I don't know, that was pretty special.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.720]  There are moments
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.820]  when we're deep into live streams like this
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.040]  where we're all playing the mini-games
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.060]  where I'm laughing so hard at you guys
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.620]  I completely forget I'm a part of the game.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.140]  I'm just like, I'm entertaining.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.640]  I'm enjoying
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.680]  the comedy so much that I'm like,
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.060]  alright, I'm fucking competing.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.840]  Watching you put that bob-omb up
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.300]  on the wall was the first piece.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.340]  Oh my god.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.000]  I couldn't believe you did it exactly like him.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.620]  It was step for step.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.560]  You did it exactly the same and I couldn't...
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.560]  Great minds think alike.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:21.620]  Yeah, something like that.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.840]  I was just trying to walk in and not hear
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.140]  what was happening around me.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.580]  It was so fucking funny, dude.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.720]  I was still laughing, man.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.320]  I wonder where he went
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.660]  because usually it's on Slack
[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:38.900]  he'll be like, oh this happened, this thing.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.780]  Well this is the thing, when Andrew drops out
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.480]  you never hear from him.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.360]  Yeah, he's gone, gone.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.180]  There's no such thing as an update
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.740]  or a private report with Andrew.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.720]  Everyone else picks up their phone and immediately
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.260]  says in Slack what happened, because they've got cellular.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.040]  And then Andrew's just gone, gone.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.320]  Oh, he's back!
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:56.480]  He's back!
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.220]  Where did you go?
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:00.820]  What happened?
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.540]  My switch died.
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.220]  What do you mean it died?
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.520]  I guess the battery was draining faster
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.240]  than the dock could charge it.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.120]  What have you got it plugged in with?
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:13.700]  The power thing.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:14.780]  What do you want from me?
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.740]  I got it plugged in with carrots,
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:18.600]  what do you think?
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.820]  You're saying the power from the power station
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.360]  is slower than the battery?
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.960]  Yes, that is what I said.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.560]  How does that even make sense?
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.440]  It was, explain to me, I don't know,
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.120]  if you can fix it, I'd love you to.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.240]  Are you using the original charger
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:34.720]  with it?
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.620]  Yeah, you're using the normal charger.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:41.220]  It's gotta be the wrong charger.
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.700]  No, I'm using the fucking Wonder Bread I bought.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.860]  That's what I'm using.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:45.700]  What?
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.640]  Is it the Nintendo...
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.900]  It says Nintendo on it.
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:50.620]  Yes!
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.800]  Can you...
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.400]  take it off the dock and plug it in
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:57.840]  directly?
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.640]  I immediately did that.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.520]  Slowly charging.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:04.780]  Okay, then...
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:06.020]  But then that would be it, right?
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.180]  I think this is it.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.240]  Surely it's still gonna
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.560]  drain faster than the...
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.280]  But also, he won't be able to
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:14.880]  play, will he?
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.000]  He's not gonna be hard-wired in.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:19.520]  That would be wifi.
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.320]  Last time, that was a thing.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.140]  Yeah, wouldn't you think
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:24.940]  that's gonna be a problem?
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.800]  Yeah, but we all locally joined on
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.540]  Gavin's thing over the internet.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:31.560]  So...
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.120]  This could go either way.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.740]  I mean, I'm okay with trying it
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.080]  if you guys are.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.060]  That's up to Andrew.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.340]  It's gonna take a long time to charge.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.800]  I think that means that's the end.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.080]  Huh.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.600]  Now, just out of curiosity,
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.600]  and there's no judgment behind this whatsoever,
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.480]  but just more from a data-collecting standpoint,
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.640]  what percentage was
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.840]  your Switch at when we began, do you know?
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.240]  I believe 62.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.920]  Okay, so one would assume if we got it to 100
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.620]  that'd be enough.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.000]  Yes.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.080]  Did you consider making it be 100
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.140]  before we started?
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.780]  There might have been judgment
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.020]  behind that question.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.060]  Well, once again, I just want to point out there was no judgment on mine.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.360]  I'm just trying to figure out the troubleshoot for next time.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.120]  Do you remember the disbelief you had, Gavin,
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.620]  when I said it was plugged in
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:18.860]  and then it died anyway?
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.520]  That. That.
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:24.700]  You're using...
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.180]  You're using
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:28.220]  hindsight to act like you really
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.060]  did a, oh, I gotcha, but you
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.960]  didn't have the hindsight for the
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.560]  you gotcha.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.220]  If this was before the game and I said,
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.260]  oh, it wasn't 100, but I'm putting it into the dock,
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.260]  you wouldn't have said, well, did you consider
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.120]  getting it 100 first? You would have said
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.280]  fine, that's fine.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:47.900]  You know what?
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.460]  I wasn't fucking on Ethernet that whole game.
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.280]  I was on Wi-Fi the whole time.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.040]  So it was plugged in, not charging,
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.080]  and you weren't even on
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:58.880]  Ethernet.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.980]  So wait, what?
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.780]  This is the craziest stream we've ever done.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:08.660]  That's incredible.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.220]  This is like an Agatha Christie murder
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:13.880]  mystery of Revelations.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.040]  We got fucking Dilkong.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:16.700]  Each is more shocking than the last.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.280]  What if AI Dilkong wins, though?
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:24.380]  I can't believe it. I cannot believe it.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.940]  Wild. This is insane.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:27.060]  Wow.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.380]  So do we have to end it, or do we just...
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:31.240]  No, I think that's it.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.920]  I think it's it, man.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.800]  I think you gotta know when to take
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.860]  old Yeller out behind the barn and put a couple
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.360]  behind the back of the head.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:44.060]  Do it like you're the governor of Wisconsin
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:44.840]  or whatever, right?
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.940]  Well, guys, thanks
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.000]  for watching. This has been Mario
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.700]  Party 15 Turns. If we would have done
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.860]  10, we would have ended right on time. It would have been
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:55.900]  great. We are right past 5.01.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.840]  Isn't this a great time? Thanks for
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.760]  watching. You can watch this on Tuesday if you're watching
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.160]  it live. Really appreciate
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.700]  everyone coming through, having fun.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.700]  And don't forget, we're live every
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.880]  Friday at 4 p.m. Central, right here
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.700]  on twitch.tv slash the regulation
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.860]  pod. Andrew, any final
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.860]  thoughts to... Fuck all video
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:14.180]  games.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:17.600]  Bye!
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:19.620]  Bye, everyone!
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.760]  Happy weekend! Yay!
