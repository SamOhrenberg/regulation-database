[00:00.000 --> 00:06.260]  This has been a day of digging into the fucking nether recesses of my mind
[00:06.260 --> 00:13.640]  to try to remember how to play old games and set up playlists and I somehow remember how to create a playlist in GTA 5
[00:13.640 --> 00:16.420]  so I've added four transform races for us to fuck out with.
[00:16.480 --> 00:19.480]  Regulation gameplay. Rummaging through the past.
[00:20.240 --> 00:22.360]  I'm going to pick Italia!
[00:22.980 --> 00:27.340]  Also, I can't speak for Gavin, but these are all transform races I've never played.
[00:27.340 --> 00:29.900]  Should we pick the same cars here or what?
[00:30.600 --> 00:32.180]  Well, I'm not picking Italia!
[00:33.680 --> 00:35.920]  Oh, you're taking Italy, GTB Custom?
[00:36.600 --> 00:40.860]  Let's all pick that car because I imagine the cars Gavin and I have are gonna...
[00:40.860 --> 00:41.880]  or, and Andrew for that matter.
[00:41.920 --> 00:46.080]  Well, un-transform, it'll only affect one tiny portion of the race, but...
[00:46.080 --> 00:46.320]  Got it.
[00:46.320 --> 00:47.720]  Then you'll be a plane or something.
[00:51.220 --> 00:54.700]  Hey guys, welcome to the video. We're having a lot of fun.
[00:54.700 --> 00:58.840]  Video games are happening on this channel all the time, so don't forget to subscribe.
[01:01.040 --> 01:01.760]  Ah, goddammit!
[01:04.940 --> 01:07.560]  Yeah, I gotta focus. I got a thousand bucks on this thing.
[01:08.100 --> 01:09.360]  Feel good about this thing. Let's do it.
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.520]  Somebody's not in the same car.
[01:10.860 --> 01:14.080]  Should we do some community videos too?
[01:14.340 --> 01:15.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16.000 --> 01:16.160]  Sure.
[01:16.560 --> 01:16.820]  I don't care.
[01:16.880 --> 01:18.340]  Were you there when we did Trivia? Yeah, you were there.
[01:18.460 --> 01:20.740]  The Trivia Pursuit thing on the stream. That was so much fun.
[01:20.800 --> 01:21.740]  See all the names. It was great.
[01:22.060 --> 01:22.660]  Yeah, it was a shit show.
[01:22.680 --> 01:24.180]  I did the Fall Guys one.
[01:24.200 --> 01:24.840]  I love shit shows.
[01:24.840 --> 01:26.680]  Is there a... is there a...
[01:27.840 --> 01:28.120]  Yep.
[01:28.340 --> 01:29.080]  Yeah, there's collision.
[01:30.120 --> 01:31.360]  What kind of question is that?
[01:31.820 --> 01:32.780]  You know the answer.
[01:33.120 --> 01:33.920]  Oh, someone's gone.
[01:34.320 --> 01:34.900]  Someone's gone.
[01:35.300 --> 01:35.740]  Goddamn.
[01:36.820 --> 01:38.020]  Thanks for the boost, asshole.
[01:39.820 --> 01:42.560]  All right, I'll see you guys later. I'm in first and I'll just be leaving.
[01:43.080 --> 01:43.420]  Okay.
[01:43.520 --> 01:44.480]  Oh, you're not going anywhere.
[01:45.360 --> 01:46.960]  What... what are we riding?
[01:47.520 --> 01:49.580]  This is a transforming flying bike.
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.400]  You can blast off, son.
[01:52.720 --> 01:54.720]  Remember, the right bumper will put the wings out.
[01:54.840 --> 01:55.620]  And you'll need them.
[01:56.020 --> 01:56.880]  And left click to boost.
[01:57.520 --> 01:58.060]  Thank you.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.020]  Oh, I got ground again.
[02:00.740 --> 02:02.080]  Oh, look at my boys up there.
[02:03.500 --> 02:03.900]  Beautiful.
[02:04.300 --> 02:04.700]  Gorgeous.
[02:05.660 --> 02:06.400]  I'll kill you.
[02:06.500 --> 02:07.000]  I'll kill you.
[02:07.840 --> 02:08.660]  I'll kill you.
[02:12.520 --> 02:13.860]  Oh, make the turn.
[02:14.440 --> 02:15.060]  Oh, boy.
[02:15.500 --> 02:16.120]  Oh, shit.
[02:16.520 --> 02:17.220]  Goddamn it, Geoff.
[02:18.040 --> 02:18.720]  What's wrong with me?
[02:18.740 --> 02:19.280]  Where'd you come from?
[02:19.480 --> 02:19.660]  Uh-oh, Gavin.
[02:19.840 --> 02:20.500]  Uh-oh, Gavin.
[02:21.140 --> 02:22.040]  Are you gonna make it?
[02:22.300 --> 02:22.640]  I know.
[02:22.840 --> 02:23.740]  You were playing a dangerous game.
[02:23.780 --> 02:24.000]  Goddamn it.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.400]  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[02:25.840 --> 02:27.180]  We're flying now, boys.
[02:28.020 --> 02:28.560]  That's where I'm from.
[02:30.120 --> 02:31.180]  Me and Jamie Thomas.
[02:33.360 --> 02:35.780]  Okay, this is down-ish.
[02:35.860 --> 02:36.460]  Oh, fuck.
[02:36.980 --> 02:37.960]  Am I driving technically?
[02:38.780 --> 02:39.580]  Oh, boy.
[02:40.260 --> 02:40.860]  Oh, boy.
[02:41.320 --> 02:41.920]  Oh, man.
[02:41.920 --> 02:43.520]  Okay, little right, little left.
[02:43.620 --> 02:44.560]  Little right, little left.
[02:44.840 --> 02:45.680]  Little right, little left.
[02:46.240 --> 02:47.540]  How'd you get ahead of me, Andrew?
[02:48.460 --> 02:49.960]  Yeah, I think the camera had a lot to do.
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.040]  This is crazy.
[02:51.720 --> 02:53.160]  Front flip for style!
[02:55.180 --> 02:56.500]  I will not be doing that.
[02:56.580 --> 02:58.360]  Is this what F1's like?
[02:58.460 --> 02:59.260]  I'm gonna land on you.
[02:59.340 --> 03:01.500]  Yeah, this is pretty much exactly what F1's like.
[03:01.620 --> 03:02.320]  I want to try to survive.
[03:03.400 --> 03:04.240]  What did I say?
[03:04.560 --> 03:05.360]  What did I tell you?
[03:07.620 --> 03:08.800]  You got bunt, bud.
[03:08.940 --> 03:09.480]  Oh, shit.
[03:10.620 --> 03:13.040]  I feel like you've been learning a lot about bunts and sprunking.
[03:13.240 --> 03:15.820]  Oh, yeah, now I am the ultimate chicken horse.
[03:16.380 --> 03:18.900]  Oh, yeah, this is the sprunk game.
[03:19.460 --> 03:19.940]  There we go.
[03:20.780 --> 03:22.240]  Oops, I put my wheels out for some reason.
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.320]  I did the same thing.
[03:23.320 --> 03:24.530]  I thought it was boost, and it wasn't.
[03:25.900 --> 03:26.780]  Oh, Gavin.
[03:27.120 --> 03:29.280]  No, yeah, boost is a triangle.
[03:29.940 --> 03:30.520]  What is this?
[03:34.500 --> 03:35.420]  Uh-oh.
[03:36.540 --> 03:37.620]  Oh, shit, who was that?
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.680]  You and Nick are fighting up there.
[03:40.880 --> 03:41.080]  Yeah.
[03:43.360 --> 03:44.580]  Cut the wings.
[03:44.840 --> 03:45.500]  Oh, shit.
[03:45.560 --> 03:45.960]  So far back.
[03:46.260 --> 03:47.120]  I just want to land.
[03:47.360 --> 03:48.060]  Did you drop?
[03:49.800 --> 03:50.260]  Geoff!
[03:51.420 --> 03:51.880]  Bitches.
[03:52.680 --> 03:53.400]  Oh, Nick.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.060]  Yeah, I got Geoffed.
[03:55.320 --> 03:56.580]  Oh, this is a disaster.
[03:56.580 --> 03:57.800]  I've gone so far back.
[03:57.920 --> 03:58.480]  Oh, what the?
[03:59.320 --> 04:00.060]  Oh, shit.
[04:00.240 --> 04:00.920]  Oh, shit.
[04:00.940 --> 04:01.320]  Here we go.
[04:01.440 --> 04:03.220]  You forgot about the boost, eh?
[04:05.360 --> 04:05.960]  Uh-oh.
[04:06.620 --> 04:07.340]  Stay with yellow.
[04:07.460 --> 04:07.880]  Stay with yellow.
[04:07.980 --> 04:08.420]  Stay with yellow.
[04:08.520 --> 04:08.980]  Stay with yellow.
[04:09.080 --> 04:09.560]  Stay with yellow.
[04:10.080 --> 04:11.340]  What the fuck?
[04:11.520 --> 04:12.660]  Okay, okay, we're doing good.
[04:13.060 --> 04:14.400]  I'm catching up on you, Eric.
[04:14.460 --> 04:15.940]  I'm coming for you, Eric.
[04:16.140 --> 04:16.660]  Here it comes.
[04:17.640 --> 04:19.320]  Here I come, buddy.
[04:19.800 --> 04:20.300]  Hey, Gavin.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.960]  Just for you on this.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.560]  Oh, no, there's no flip.
[04:26.980 --> 04:27.600]  We're planes.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.480]  I was gonna front flip for style.
[04:30.340 --> 04:30.900]  In a plane?
[04:31.540 --> 04:33.020]  Well, then we turned into planes.
[04:34.280 --> 04:35.280]  I'm gonna try to gain.
[04:35.940 --> 04:38.100]  My license plate upside down says Oni Vag.
[04:38.740 --> 04:39.140]  Nice.
[04:39.980 --> 04:41.000]  This Vag is only for you?
[04:44.400 --> 04:45.900]  Wow, I only just got to the plane.
[04:46.760 --> 04:47.160]  Wow.
[04:47.680 --> 04:48.700]  It's been a rough ride for you, huh?
[04:48.700 --> 04:49.200]  You're doing great.
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.120]  Well, I botched it on the...
[04:52.260 --> 04:54.380]  What's the flying bike called again?
[04:55.480 --> 04:55.720]  Uh-oh.
[04:56.500 --> 04:57.140]  Rocket bike?
[04:57.500 --> 04:58.900]  Uh, I don't fucking remember.
[04:59.020 --> 05:00.080]  Why am I upside down?
[05:00.100 --> 05:01.080]  Oh, my God!
[05:01.140 --> 05:02.080]  Oh, my God!
[05:02.080 --> 05:02.780]  Who was that?
[05:03.080 --> 05:03.680]  That was me.
[05:03.820 --> 05:04.740]  I came out of the...
[05:04.740 --> 05:06.460]  I just landed upside down and exploded.
[05:06.460 --> 05:07.480]  That was crazy.
[05:08.400 --> 05:10.600]  Oh, that was my fucking first place.
[05:11.440 --> 05:12.700]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[05:12.960 --> 05:13.600]  It's me, baby.
[05:14.200 --> 05:14.980]  I'm in first.
[05:17.520 --> 05:19.860]  Oh, I was fifth for most of this race.
[05:20.800 --> 05:21.560]  Two laps.
[05:22.160 --> 05:22.740]  Uh-oh.
[05:23.280 --> 05:24.120]  Who the hell's that?
[05:25.040 --> 05:25.380]  Andrew.
[05:25.660 --> 05:26.320]  Oh, Nick.
[05:30.260 --> 05:31.860]  I can't believe I caught up a bit.
[05:32.100 --> 05:32.740]  Ah, Andrew!
[05:33.480 --> 05:34.060]  My job.
[05:35.140 --> 05:35.680]  Kill you.
[05:36.220 --> 05:37.500]  Bring it on, Nick.
[05:39.140 --> 05:40.360]  I see more people?
[05:41.240 --> 05:41.560]  No.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.280]  No, that means you're close to me.
[05:43.360 --> 05:45.020]  No, look at...
[05:47.140 --> 05:49.240]  Did you just race by me, you little prick?
[05:49.660 --> 05:51.220]  I was boosting, son.
[05:52.100 --> 05:52.860]  I don't like that.
[05:55.380 --> 05:56.780]  Oh, that was almost real bad.
[05:57.920 --> 05:58.520]  Oh, you idiot.
[05:58.940 --> 05:59.760]  That's not that.
[06:00.720 --> 06:02.260]  Oh, on my screen, you went under the...
[06:02.260 --> 06:03.180]  I'm gaining on you there.
[06:03.580 --> 06:04.520]  That's what I actually did last time.
[06:06.640 --> 06:07.680]  Oh, they're fighting.
[06:08.360 --> 06:08.840]  All right, boys.
[06:08.940 --> 06:13.880]  Oh, don't do it.
[06:14.100 --> 06:15.180]  It happened again.
[06:17.200 --> 06:18.080]  Oh, shit.
[06:18.660 --> 06:19.100]  Soap.
[06:19.680 --> 06:20.440]  How did you do that?
[06:20.440 --> 06:22.000]  Andrew, where'd you come from?
[06:22.020 --> 06:23.220]  I've been moving.
[06:32.500 --> 06:33.520]  I'm coming for you.
[06:33.520 --> 06:34.520]  A little left, a little left, a little left.
[06:34.580 --> 06:35.640]  Please don't. Please don't come.
[06:36.360 --> 06:36.620]  Right.
[06:36.960 --> 06:37.920]  Hold it in. Hold it in.
[06:38.660 --> 06:41.060]  Nick, I need you to edge for a little bit longer, buddy.
[06:41.200 --> 06:41.840]  All right, I got you.
[06:41.960 --> 06:42.480]  Oh, Eric.
[06:42.640 --> 06:43.600]  Got him. Got him.
[06:43.740 --> 06:46.000]  Baseball, baseball, baseball, baseball, baseball, baseball, baseball.
[06:47.380 --> 06:48.780]  Mark McGuire, Sussefielder, baseball.
[06:49.420 --> 06:50.020]  Bam Bam Bigelow.
[06:51.120 --> 06:51.760]  King Kong Bundy.
[06:52.600 --> 06:52.920]  Fuck.
[06:53.220 --> 06:54.380]  Those are all my guys.
[06:56.900 --> 06:59.220]  Do you now just get a boner when you think about him?
[06:59.760 --> 06:59.920]  Yeah.
[07:02.280 --> 07:05.360]  I can only come thinking of King Kong Bundy now.
[07:05.500 --> 07:06.540]  Oh, shit, Eric.
[07:06.900 --> 07:07.460]  Oh, boy.
[07:07.600 --> 07:07.700]  Yeah.
[07:08.600 --> 07:09.320]  Oh, boy.
[07:09.800 --> 07:12.320]  Wasn't King Kong Bundy at one of our Let's Builds?
[07:12.440 --> 07:13.540]  Like a big discussion about it?
[07:13.860 --> 07:14.360]  I think so.
[07:15.880 --> 07:17.880]  Gavin, we've talked about every single thing.
[07:18.180 --> 07:21.480]  We're on a 15-year cycle where we've forgotten enough.
[07:21.520 --> 07:22.220]  We can just do it again.
[07:23.900 --> 07:25.440]  It's like this is all new to us, too.
[07:28.260 --> 07:29.780]  Oh, Transform Race is cool.
[07:33.520 --> 07:41.400]  I will say this about us sitting here playing these old GTA games and stuff.
[07:41.500 --> 07:45.080]  We're doing this because these are still some of the best experiences you can have
[07:45.080 --> 07:46.220]  playing multiplayer together.
[07:46.660 --> 07:50.200]  Which means, what the fuck has the gaming world been doing for the past decade?
[07:50.480 --> 07:51.320]  Oh, no, the boost!
[07:51.920 --> 07:53.240]  I think there are a lot of other good games.
[07:53.240 --> 07:55.920]  It's just the services are so off-putting to me.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.160]  I don't like the fact...
[07:57.160 --> 07:58.260]  I mean, this game is cool, you know what I mean?
[07:58.400 --> 08:01.340]  I don't like it when my game is different every time I freaking turn it on.
[08:01.640 --> 08:02.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:02.140 --> 08:03.400]  I'm so disappointed in Siege.
[08:03.520 --> 08:03.980]  No, no, no, no!
[08:03.980 --> 08:06.680]  I was going to say when we talk about it, we were going to play Siege and we can't.
[08:07.340 --> 08:10.220]  Now we found out the terrorist attack which came with the game in launch
[08:10.220 --> 08:11.980]  and is in all the previous versions of the game.
[08:12.440 --> 08:17.500]  And our favorite fucking game in Siege is gone.
[08:17.920 --> 08:19.280]  Nick, where'd you come from?
[08:19.780 --> 08:20.880]  I'm on you, buddy!
[08:21.500 --> 08:23.180]  Like, how hard is it to keep it in?
[08:23.180 --> 08:27.020]  Is it just the new operators aren't compatible with that style?
[08:27.520 --> 08:30.380]  Or it's like they just... I'm sure there is a reason.
[08:30.960 --> 08:34.560]  Or they're just like, they look at the metrics and nobody plays it.
[08:34.600 --> 08:37.220]  Yeah, but I just don't know why that matters to them if it's already in the damn game.
[08:37.220 --> 08:38.120]  If it's already there, yeah.
[08:38.560 --> 08:40.700]  They've already got servers up for other game type.
[08:41.200 --> 08:42.620]  Like, is it a real estate issue?
[08:43.360 --> 08:44.320]  Yeah, it could be like...
[08:44.320 --> 08:44.700]  Oh, Eric!
[08:45.180 --> 08:46.540]  What are you doing, bud?
[08:46.680 --> 08:47.340]  What are you doing?
[08:47.340 --> 08:48.300]  What are you doing?
[08:49.120 --> 08:51.320]  We're living life on the edge!
[08:51.580 --> 08:52.660]  The worst time to die.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.620]  Oh, Nick is in first!
[08:56.320 --> 08:59.140]  I was in first the whole time and then Nick fucked me!
[08:59.660 --> 09:00.540]  No, you fucked yourself!
[09:00.720 --> 09:02.020]  No, you fucked me!
[09:02.320 --> 09:03.040]  Show the replay!
[09:05.880 --> 09:07.800]  This isn't a Geoff wins or anything, is it?
[09:07.820 --> 09:08.020]  Geoff in first!
[09:08.960 --> 09:10.300]  I legit won that, right?
[09:10.720 --> 09:11.200]  You won it!
[09:11.880 --> 09:12.360]  Damn it!
[09:12.360 --> 09:12.540]  It was you!
[09:13.100 --> 09:14.380]  I caught up right at the end there.
[09:14.940 --> 09:16.480]  Yeah, Geoff, you won. Good work.
[09:16.500 --> 09:17.440]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Geoff.
[09:17.660 --> 09:18.260]  Good work, dude.
[09:20.560 --> 09:22.640]  Thanks for making this playlist, by the way.
[09:26.220 --> 09:28.040]  Oh, limp in, limp in, limp in!
[09:28.340 --> 09:28.880]  Limp in!
[09:29.540 --> 09:30.320]  Limp in!
[09:31.060 --> 09:32.120]  What, you lost?
[09:32.340 --> 09:32.620]  Yeah!
[09:33.600 --> 09:34.260]  Who, me?
[09:34.800 --> 09:35.240]  Yeah.
[09:35.620 --> 09:40.360]  Yeah, I fought to first and then I died and it sent me all the way back.
[09:41.220 --> 09:42.100]  Oh, man!
[09:42.360 --> 09:42.840]  Ge points!
[09:44.220 --> 09:44.900]  Seven points.
[09:44.900 --> 09:46.900]  Boy, they turned out to be absolutely worthless, didn't they?
[09:47.320 --> 09:48.440]  That never got implemented, right?
[09:48.720 --> 09:50.000]  Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[09:50.500 --> 09:51.360]  Job points.
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.280]  They were supposed to be something you could use to unlock game modes or something initially,
[09:56.460 --> 09:58.200]  and then they just never implemented whatever it was.
[09:59.760 --> 10:01.240]  I vote that I like that.
[10:02.500 --> 10:06.720]  It's probably the longest I've ever gone without being mugged in GTA.
[10:08.700 --> 10:11.880]  Well, if it helps Gavin, I don't know how to do that, so...
[10:11.880 --> 10:12.840]  I wonder...
[10:12.840 --> 10:15.400]  You know, obviously, I want to go back and fuck around
[10:15.400 --> 10:18.320]  with some of the old GTA game types and stuff we have, Gavin.
[10:18.700 --> 10:19.460]  It'll take some exploring.
[10:19.460 --> 10:22.300]  But one thing that I was thinking of that could be fun to do again
[10:22.980 --> 10:25.460]  would be Frogger with the new guys.
[10:25.480 --> 10:26.040]  Oh, yeah.
[10:27.540 --> 10:30.440]  Race type standard, laps two, noon, traffic off...
[10:30.440 --> 10:36.100]  I think someone figured out that I was mugged for an actual real amount of money total.
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.080]  Are we all picking the same bikes or what?
[10:42.300 --> 10:43.440]  Get the Shotaro.
[10:43.800 --> 10:44.160]  Okay, cool.
[10:44.960 --> 10:45.220]  Okay.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.320]  Oh, my custom Fagio.
[10:48.040 --> 10:48.440]  I know.
[10:49.460 --> 10:50.700]  I got a lot of good motorcycles.
[10:51.140 --> 10:55.460]  I think that would be a real barometer for the times,
[10:55.660 --> 10:59.300]  is whether or not the Fagio returns in GTA 6.
[10:59.720 --> 11:00.540]  Hey, everyone look at me.
[11:00.620 --> 11:01.500]  Did my character come through?
[11:06.060 --> 11:06.560]  Yeah!
[11:08.620 --> 11:09.500]  Little Ratman.
[11:10.080 --> 11:15.840]  I meant to ask you earlier why your character looked like Todd Womack before the Ratmans.
[11:17.800 --> 11:20.920]  I finally figured out how to get him back in this mode, baby.
[11:21.040 --> 11:22.100]  The rat's back.
[11:23.700 --> 11:24.760]  Welcome back, rat.
[11:32.510 --> 11:34.630]  Oh, there is a boost if you hit perfect.
[11:35.750 --> 11:36.630]  Oh, shit.
[11:36.730 --> 11:36.910]  Really?
[11:37.150 --> 11:37.370]  Okay.
[11:37.610 --> 11:38.250]  Yeah, that's a race.
[11:38.610 --> 11:39.050]  Hey.
[11:40.750 --> 11:43.630]  I was just about to say, yeah, it's a racing game.
[11:50.950 --> 11:51.150]  Oh.
[12:01.210 --> 12:03.770]  There's always someone to take the reins and prick them.
[12:04.590 --> 12:05.010]  Backflip!
[12:07.150 --> 12:07.990]  Double backflip!
[12:09.730 --> 12:10.270]  Hey, what's up, Geoff?
[12:11.530 --> 12:13.750]  Wasn't there a race where you could thump each other with hammers?
[12:15.030 --> 12:17.710]  Yes, I think that might have been GTA 4.
[12:17.910 --> 12:18.130]  Oh.
[12:19.430 --> 12:20.210]  What am I driving?
[12:20.210 --> 12:21.970]  A Lost and Damned thing.
[12:21.990 --> 12:22.670]  What the hell's happening?
[12:23.990 --> 12:24.350]  Jesus.
[12:25.210 --> 12:25.930]  Yeah, Lost and Damned.
[12:25.970 --> 12:27.030]  I'm about to play that on a...
[12:28.790 --> 12:29.150]  PC.
[12:29.590 --> 12:33.950]  Yeah, it's like Remy Tim's Toilet Bowl.
[12:35.430 --> 12:37.030]  Look into the, uh...
[12:37.030 --> 12:40.370]  Do me a favor, look into the multiplayer when you get in there and see if that's a game type.
[12:40.690 --> 12:41.210]  All right.
[12:42.770 --> 12:44.650]  Remy Tim's Toilet Bowl.
[12:45.250 --> 12:47.350]  That's going to be every comment on this video.
[12:47.790 --> 12:49.690]  This is where I came up with the idea of this race.
[12:49.690 --> 12:51.730]  This is, uh, the wizard's sleeve, by the way.
[12:56.990 --> 12:57.910]  I'm hallucinating.
[12:59.610 --> 13:01.030]  I'm four helicopters.
[13:01.450 --> 13:02.190]  Uh-oh, we're dead.
[13:02.310 --> 13:03.050]  Oh, Jesus.
[13:04.110 --> 13:05.030]  Oh, God.
[13:05.510 --> 13:06.230]  Why? What?
[13:06.390 --> 13:06.950]  Oh, boy.
[13:07.450 --> 13:08.010]  Oh, boy.
[13:08.370 --> 13:09.210]  Oh, boy.
[13:09.530 --> 13:10.230]  Oh, boy.
[13:10.670 --> 13:11.250]  My weakness.
[13:12.490 --> 13:12.950]  Yeah.
[13:13.170 --> 13:14.510]  I don't know how to fly these.
[13:15.850 --> 13:17.170]  Lean forwards first.
[13:17.750 --> 13:18.610]  Yeah, I see that now.
[13:21.090 --> 13:21.910]  Who's up there?
[13:22.030 --> 13:23.150]  I'm coming for you.
[13:23.350 --> 13:24.130]  Bring it on.
[13:25.210 --> 13:26.310]  Suck my tail, Rueh.
[13:27.250 --> 13:28.270]  How you doing over there, Nick?
[13:28.750 --> 13:30.070]  Ah, we made it.
[13:30.510 --> 13:31.030]  Uh-oh.
[13:31.250 --> 13:32.050]  Oh, boy.
[13:32.250 --> 13:32.910]  Who was that?
[13:32.970 --> 13:33.530]  Uh-oh.
[13:33.990 --> 13:34.890]  Was that you, Eric?
[13:35.130 --> 13:35.470]  Yeah.
[13:35.630 --> 13:37.210]  Dude, that was a hell of a recovery, man.
[13:38.110 --> 13:39.030]  Oh, that's right.
[13:39.030 --> 13:40.690]  I have to hold both to stay even.
[13:40.810 --> 13:41.010]  Okay.
[13:41.830 --> 13:42.230]  Both.
[13:42.490 --> 13:42.850]  Oh.
[13:43.230 --> 13:43.390]  Both.
[13:43.390 --> 13:43.770]  Oh.
[13:43.790 --> 13:44.650]  Yeah, get him, Gavin.
[13:45.310 --> 13:45.810]  All right.
[13:47.490 --> 13:49.450]  You've entered full mode there, Gavin.
[13:51.070 --> 13:53.850]  Oh, man.
[13:55.230 --> 13:55.590]  Jumps!
[13:55.950 --> 13:56.990]  How do we change?
[13:57.090 --> 13:58.190]  When do we change back?
[13:58.350 --> 13:59.570]  I can't keep seeing this thing.
[13:59.610 --> 14:00.470]  It's going to explode.
[14:01.570 --> 14:01.890]  Oh, my God.
[14:03.110 --> 14:05.190]  Oh, my God.
[14:07.670 --> 14:08.810]  Win, win, win.
[14:08.930 --> 14:09.570]  Please, please.
[14:09.730 --> 14:10.290]  Oh, no.
[14:12.050 --> 14:13.170]  Oh, oh, the windmills.
[14:13.470 --> 14:14.150]  Oh, the windmills.
[14:14.570 --> 14:14.910]  Oh.
[14:15.270 --> 14:17.390]  Oh, please, please, please let me be a boat.
[14:17.490 --> 14:18.250]  Please let me be a boat.
[14:18.350 --> 14:19.130]  Please let me be a boat.
[14:19.230 --> 14:19.990]  Please let me be a boat.
[14:22.010 --> 14:24.090]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[14:24.230 --> 14:24.470]  All right, here's...
[14:25.910 --> 14:28.950]  Now, nautically, this is where I'm most happy.
[14:29.090 --> 14:29.930]  This is truly...
[14:29.930 --> 14:30.830]  Who's in fifth place?
[14:31.350 --> 14:31.570]  Nick?
[14:31.570 --> 14:31.770]  Me!
[14:33.490 --> 14:34.430]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[14:34.870 --> 14:35.650]  Nick's struggling.
[14:35.870 --> 14:36.370]  Get there, Geoff.
[14:36.430 --> 14:37.650]  Get there before you...
[14:37.650 --> 14:38.310]  Oh, my God.
[14:38.310 --> 14:39.790]  I crashed into the water and turned into a boat.
[14:40.730 --> 14:42.070]  Can I come?
[14:43.030 --> 14:46.630]  Is there, like, a magic ship or is the boat just not very fast?
[14:47.550 --> 14:48.750]  The boat's just a tug.
[14:48.750 --> 14:54.770]  Nick, you just fucking dove under my boat.
[14:54.950 --> 14:55.270]  That was amazing.
[14:55.290 --> 14:55.470]  Really?
[14:55.730 --> 14:57.850]  Dude, I was a submarine for a minute.
[14:58.550 --> 14:59.350]  That was unbelievable.
[14:59.450 --> 15:01.530]  I'm happy to be in last place just to witness that.
[15:02.150 --> 15:04.310]  Oh, we're about to be bikes, Andrew.
[15:04.690 --> 15:05.770]  I'm trying to get you.
[15:05.830 --> 15:07.510]  It's a lot better when there's Yacht Rock playing instead of just...
[15:07.510 --> 15:09.350]  You know the best part about this race?
[15:10.490 --> 15:11.330]  It's two laps.
[15:11.570 --> 15:12.970]  Oh, fuck, you're right.
[15:13.110 --> 15:13.930]  God damn it.
[15:14.290 --> 15:14.650]  Bastard.
[15:15.030 --> 15:16.390]  Plenty of time for me to...
[15:18.070 --> 15:18.310]  Huh?
[15:18.310 --> 15:19.010]  I already did.
[15:20.770 --> 15:24.450]  Man, this boat is slow as dicks.
[15:26.050 --> 15:27.070]  Why does anybody wear a mask?
[15:27.110 --> 15:27.870]  Oh my god.
[15:28.590 --> 15:29.870]  What plane is this?
[15:30.030 --> 15:30.770]  I don't even remember this one.
[15:30.890 --> 15:31.610]  We're back to...
[15:31.610 --> 15:32.570]  What is this?
[15:33.530 --> 15:34.270]  You're in planes?
[15:34.850 --> 15:36.810]  I'm not even at the motorcycle in front of me yet.
[15:36.810 --> 15:37.070]  Yeah.
[15:38.750 --> 15:44.270]  It's like a slightly more expensive Randy Quaid crop duster in Independence Day.
[15:44.790 --> 15:46.830]  Oh, boys!
[15:47.370 --> 15:47.890]  Yeah.
[15:48.050 --> 15:49.270]  Damn, you beat me to it.
[15:50.290 --> 15:51.330]  I'm crashing!
[15:54.410 --> 15:55.750]  I'm so fucked.
[15:56.710 --> 15:57.410]  This thing's quick.
[15:57.490 --> 15:57.730]  Oh.
[15:59.010 --> 16:01.490]  Isn't this kind of plane used to track tornadoes?
[16:01.510 --> 16:02.210]  What the hell is this?
[16:02.210 --> 16:02.610]  Whoopsie.
[16:03.490 --> 16:04.670]  Botched it in first.
[16:05.250 --> 16:07.190]  Absolutely nothing going on and I botched it.
[16:07.970 --> 16:08.390]  Botched up?
[16:08.950 --> 16:10.250]  I botched it so hard.
[16:10.710 --> 16:11.150]  Wizard sleeve!
[16:11.450 --> 16:13.510]  I slid into the wizard sleeve and spun out.
[16:14.350 --> 16:16.530]  Oh, there's cars?
[16:16.830 --> 16:17.250]  Sweet.
[16:18.290 --> 16:18.710]  Please.
[16:18.850 --> 16:19.330]  Oh, God.
[16:19.450 --> 16:20.030]  Nick, you're catching up?
[16:20.570 --> 16:21.130]  I'm gaining.
[16:22.110 --> 16:22.690]  What am I?
[16:22.710 --> 16:22.990]  I see Gavin.
[16:24.110 --> 16:26.570]  Oh, this is the like crisscross road hell.
[16:27.330 --> 16:28.430]  Oh, my God, I can't.
[16:28.530 --> 16:29.730]  Oh, my brain!
[16:31.270 --> 16:32.050]  Here we go.
[16:32.310 --> 16:32.930]  Oh, no, it's Eric.
[16:32.970 --> 16:34.310]  What is going on?
[16:34.730 --> 16:36.310]  How have we not lapped yet?
[16:36.430 --> 16:37.530]  How did you do me?
[16:41.130 --> 16:41.710]  Whiskey dick.
[16:42.910 --> 16:43.690]  Holy shit.
[16:44.350 --> 16:45.190]  All right, now I'm right behind Gavin.
[16:45.190 --> 16:46.010]  Lap two.
[16:48.370 --> 16:50.390]  All right, full speed, full tilt.
[16:50.710 --> 16:52.090]  Let's get that slipstream cooking.
[16:53.730 --> 16:54.750]  Where are you going?
[16:55.490 --> 16:57.190]  I'm trying not to give you the slipstream.
[16:59.430 --> 17:02.050]  Andrew, I think I see you.
[17:02.050 --> 17:03.790]  Me and Gavin are trading, Nate.
[17:04.870 --> 17:05.590]  Give me that yellow.
[17:06.270 --> 17:07.670]  I want that yellow paint, you bitch.
[17:07.690 --> 17:08.670]  Get away, Nick.
[17:09.610 --> 17:10.250]  And lap two.
[17:10.250 --> 17:10.630]  Lap two.
[17:10.770 --> 17:11.970]  Get away from my slipstream.
[17:12.450 --> 17:12.770]  Whoops.
[17:12.770 --> 17:13.470]  It has to be done.
[17:13.470 --> 17:14.310]  Oh, shit.
[17:14.310 --> 17:15.090]  Gavin!
[17:15.330 --> 17:16.330]  Gavin, no!
[17:16.710 --> 17:17.210]  Gavin!
[17:21.640 --> 17:22.160]  Gavin!
[17:22.500 --> 17:24.440]  I see you, you whiskey-dicked motherfucker.
[17:24.940 --> 17:25.120]  Get away.
[17:25.300 --> 17:25.580]  Oh!
[17:26.300 --> 17:28.100]  Oh, I'm in fourth!
[17:28.240 --> 17:29.340]  Ooh, Andrew's in first.
[17:30.000 --> 17:30.520]  Bye!
[17:31.040 --> 17:37.080]  Me and Gavin were bumping each other here and we flew off the level.
[17:37.200 --> 17:38.340]  We said it couldn't be done.
[17:38.480 --> 17:39.840]  We'll get our Gleasel bumped.
[17:42.780 --> 17:44.180]  That was really funny.
[17:44.240 --> 17:44.480]  Oh, no.
[17:44.940 --> 17:45.580]  No, don't touch me.
[17:46.060 --> 17:46.820]  Oh, no!
[17:46.820 --> 17:47.640]  Touch Nick, touch Nick!
[17:47.760 --> 17:47.960]  Touch him!
[17:48.520 --> 17:49.240]  Touch him!
[17:49.600 --> 17:50.920]  Oh, Andrew, you...
[17:50.920 --> 17:52.100]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[17:54.140 --> 17:55.520]  I just gotta get to the helicopters.
[17:57.140 --> 17:58.020]  By one weakness.
[18:00.260 --> 18:01.900]  Oh, I can't believe I'm back in first.
[18:01.980 --> 18:03.700]  I can see somebody up there.
[18:04.160 --> 18:05.120]  Oh, I can see two of you.
[18:05.980 --> 18:06.340]  Shit!
[18:06.480 --> 18:07.800]  Dude, we're all bunched up.
[18:07.840 --> 18:09.200]  If you see one of us, you see all of us.
[18:09.340 --> 18:09.660]  Yeah, I do.
[18:11.340 --> 18:12.480]  I'm right behind Gavin.
[18:13.080 --> 18:13.760]  The wizard's tube.
[18:14.980 --> 18:16.340]  The wizard's tube.
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.620]  See, we got tubes.
[18:22.660 --> 18:23.540]  Oh, Nick.
[18:24.380 --> 18:24.840]  Andrew.
[18:25.580 --> 18:26.580]  Just trade me.
[18:26.820 --> 18:27.720]  This is it, here we go.
[18:27.720 --> 18:28.580]  Here we go, Chaz.
[18:29.100 --> 18:29.340]  Yep.
[18:31.800 --> 18:33.320]  I won't get fooled again, Andrew.
[18:34.180 --> 18:34.380]  What?
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.760]  Yep, yep, yep.
[18:42.300 --> 18:43.200]  Oh, fuck me.
[18:43.200 --> 18:45.200]  We're all trying to focus so hard on this.
[18:45.740 --> 18:46.200]  I...
[18:46.200 --> 18:47.340]  I'll chop his beach.
[18:47.460 --> 18:48.040]  I wasn't fooled again.
[18:49.180 --> 18:49.720]  Uh-oh.
[18:50.200 --> 18:51.960]  How do I make this go faster?
[18:52.080 --> 18:53.540]  You guys are already killing me.
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.840]  How do I make a helicopter go faster?
[18:56.000 --> 18:56.380]  Get off!
[18:56.420 --> 18:56.960]  You lean forward.
[18:57.020 --> 18:57.800]  You piece of shit!
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.700]  I'm going low!
[18:59.940 --> 19:00.760]  I'm going low!
[19:01.180 --> 19:01.720]  Oh!
[19:03.620 --> 19:05.180]  Oh, it's raining paint.
[19:07.760 --> 19:08.460]  What happened?
[19:08.660 --> 19:10.340]  What happened to you two?
[19:10.860 --> 19:12.060]  We hit each other.
[19:13.380 --> 19:14.680]  Oh, the Ouroboros.
[19:17.240 --> 19:19.000]  Gavin, we can't keep doing this.
[19:19.960 --> 19:20.400]  Ah!
[19:23.720 --> 19:25.460]  Ah, Rob or Ross.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.640]  Oh, nice cut by you.
[19:29.740 --> 19:30.260]  That was awesome.
[19:30.860 --> 19:33.560]  Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up!
[19:33.620 --> 19:33.780]  Okay.
[19:34.280 --> 19:35.020]  Why do you want to pull up?
[19:35.120 --> 19:35.820]  We're going to the...
[19:35.820 --> 19:36.720]  We're becoming boats.
[19:38.460 --> 19:41.800]  Well, initially, it was a bad timing.
[19:48.820 --> 19:50.780]  I hate how I cut that.
[19:51.320 --> 19:51.900]  There may be two.
[19:54.700 --> 19:55.520]  We're locked in.
[19:55.980 --> 19:56.400]  We're sailing.
[19:57.740 --> 19:59.360]  It takes me away to where?
[19:59.860 --> 20:00.440]  Where should I be going?
[20:00.580 --> 20:01.620]  Get away from me!
[20:02.220 --> 20:02.420]  Who, me?
[20:03.000 --> 20:03.400]  Yes!
[20:03.840 --> 20:04.760]  What do you mean, who, me?
[20:04.820 --> 20:05.320]  Yes, you!
[20:06.420 --> 20:09.040]  I feel like he's being pretty inoffensive back here.
[20:09.120 --> 20:10.740]  I'm trying to get a boat stream.
[20:11.640 --> 20:12.820]  I'm going to ride like the wind.
[20:13.240 --> 20:14.280]  And then you son of a bitch.
[20:17.600 --> 20:18.540]  We're locked in.
[20:18.800 --> 20:19.580]  We're locked in.
[20:19.880 --> 20:21.340]  You bastard, get away from me.
[20:21.340 --> 20:22.940]  Get away from me.
[20:22.980 --> 20:23.940]  Geoff, save me.
[20:24.000 --> 20:24.460]  Hurry up.
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.440]  I'm trying, man.
[20:25.460 --> 20:26.240]  I feel free again.
[20:28.760 --> 20:31.460]  Oh, I got such a long way to go.
[20:32.920 --> 20:34.340]  How do you get to the border of Mexico?
[20:35.360 --> 20:36.380]  You're not getting me.
[20:36.520 --> 20:37.300]  I'm free, baby.
[20:39.580 --> 20:41.060]  Ride like the wind.
[20:41.420 --> 20:42.140]  Come on.
[20:43.760 --> 20:44.740]  Here I come.
[20:45.040 --> 20:45.920]  Here I come.
[20:46.180 --> 20:47.460]  Oh, I can feel the bike.
[20:48.340 --> 20:49.240]  Let's catch up.
[20:50.140 --> 20:50.720]  No slipstream.
[20:50.780 --> 20:51.320]  No slipstream.
[20:51.320 --> 20:51.840]  No slipstream.
[20:51.960 --> 20:52.520]  There we go.
[20:56.120 --> 20:59.280]  Yeah, you're right.
[20:59.320 --> 21:00.320]  I was that far behind last time.
[21:01.260 --> 21:01.920]  Bloody hell, all right.
[21:01.980 --> 21:03.080]  You're alive with a damn gaffe.
[21:03.140 --> 21:03.860]  What are you playing at?
[21:04.420 --> 21:06.480]  Oh, oh, dust just went to my eye.
[21:06.480 --> 21:07.320]  Trying to stay away from you.
[21:07.820 --> 21:08.800]  Trying to stay away from you.
[21:09.300 --> 21:09.900]  Yeah, stay away.
[21:10.020 --> 21:10.520]  Stay back there.
[21:10.700 --> 21:11.120]  I'm trying.
[21:11.240 --> 21:11.720]  I'm trying.
[21:11.980 --> 21:12.600]  Oh, no.
[21:15.780 --> 21:16.880]  Oh, this sucks.
[21:17.740 --> 21:19.480]  Oh, it's really hard to do this with one eye.
[21:19.500 --> 21:19.940]  Land on him.
[21:20.340 --> 21:20.900]  Oh, shit.
[21:21.780 --> 21:22.380]  Oh, God.
[21:22.380 --> 21:23.280]  Oh, God.
[21:23.320 --> 21:23.680]  Be real.
[21:24.140 --> 21:24.960]  I'm panicking.
[21:25.120 --> 21:25.520]  I'm panicking.
[21:25.620 --> 21:26.160]  I'm panicking.
[21:26.340 --> 21:26.700]  I'm panicking.
[21:27.820 --> 21:29.100]  Panic, panic, loser.
[21:30.460 --> 21:33.560]  Just for that, I feel totally refreshed.
[21:33.640 --> 21:34.400]  Hey, you're welcome.
[21:34.740 --> 21:35.560]  I'm good, thank you.
[21:37.040 --> 21:38.680]  We had a little wizard sleeve kerfuffle.
[21:39.160 --> 21:42.280]  Yeah, we were docking in the wizard sleeve.
[21:44.440 --> 21:45.660]  Fuck it, Nick.
[21:45.840 --> 21:46.840]  Oh, no, it's this part.
[21:47.020 --> 21:47.980]  Oh, shit, my brain.
[21:48.800 --> 21:49.380]  Oh, shit.
[21:49.960 --> 21:51.220]  I'm sorry, Andrew.
[21:51.220 --> 21:53.480]  That was such an asshole move.
[21:53.940 --> 21:54.740]  What'd you do?
[21:55.360 --> 21:56.920]  I completely flipped me.
[21:57.920 --> 21:58.540]  Well, that's rude.
[21:58.980 --> 21:59.680]  It is.
[22:00.680 --> 22:02.560]  I'm sorry, the wizard, he got to me.
[22:02.940 --> 22:03.600]  The wizard?
[22:03.760 --> 22:04.680]  Oh, shit, Geoff.
[22:04.680 --> 22:06.440]  Oh, where did you come from?
[22:06.840 --> 22:07.980]  Cooking ahead, the finish line.
[22:07.980 --> 22:08.640]  No way!
[22:09.880 --> 22:12.240]  Wow, Gavin took it right at the end.
[22:12.420 --> 22:13.000]  That was great.
[22:16.560 --> 22:17.760]  Way to go, man.
[22:17.820 --> 22:18.360]  That was awesome.
[22:18.360 --> 22:18.780]  Hell yeah.
[22:18.860 --> 22:20.040]  Oh, we're neck and neck with me.
[22:20.140 --> 22:20.640]  I'm level eight.
[22:20.640 --> 22:23.540]  You're level 113?
[22:23.680 --> 22:24.480]  That's really funny.
[22:24.760 --> 22:24.840]  130.
[22:25.700 --> 22:26.940]  You want to complain more about the levels?
[22:28.780 --> 22:33.400]  I'm going to complain about dust going into my eye as soon as I became the crop duster of the tube.
[22:33.540 --> 22:35.880]  And I'm just squinting, trying to get it out.
[22:37.080 --> 22:37.440]  Boo!
[22:39.660 --> 22:40.580]  Oh, I ran my bet.
[22:41.880 --> 22:42.760]  Fuck, I'm down.
[22:42.900 --> 22:43.700]  Betting on yourself.
[22:43.760 --> 22:44.480]  Oh, fuck.
[22:46.360 --> 22:47.280]  How much did you bet?
[22:48.460 --> 22:49.500]  600 bucks, apparently.
[22:50.200 --> 22:50.640]  Nice.
[22:51.900 --> 22:52.900]  All right, it's waiting on Nick.
[22:52.940 --> 22:53.300]  There we go.
[22:53.440 --> 22:54.600]  Nick bet on himself and lost.
[22:55.020 --> 22:55.800]  I sure did.
[22:55.940 --> 22:57.400]  That's not the first time, I think.
[22:59.900 --> 23:00.340]  Yeah.
[23:01.820 --> 23:05.080]  Oh, this is looking like my time.
[23:05.280 --> 23:06.500]  Now we're talking.
[23:06.960 --> 23:08.840]  Oh, 1.58 miles, too.
[23:09.120 --> 23:09.740]  Not long.
[23:10.300 --> 23:11.100]  Four laps.
[23:11.540 --> 23:12.800]  We don't get to pick this time.
[23:13.160 --> 23:13.340]  No.
[23:13.480 --> 23:17.520]  Go ahead and hit it with a little bit.
[23:22.960 --> 23:24.740]  Oh, I got it.
[23:24.740 --> 23:25.760]  God damn it.
[23:26.000 --> 23:26.900]  Trying to blow a kiss.
[23:28.360 --> 23:29.140]  Wait, what's this?
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.220]  I thought we were monster trucks.
[23:30.540 --> 23:31.300]  Wait, what am I driving?
[23:31.940 --> 23:32.580]  What am I driving?
[23:33.080 --> 23:34.200]  Someone's in like a Rolls.
[23:35.240 --> 23:35.960]  Random vehicle.
[23:36.060 --> 23:36.720]  What's going on?
[23:36.780 --> 23:37.480]  Why do I have this?
[23:37.540 --> 23:37.980]  Oh, wow.
[23:38.920 --> 23:40.520]  Oh, get the guy on the motorcycle.
[23:40.760 --> 23:41.520]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[23:41.960 --> 23:42.780]  Eat his ass.
[23:43.360 --> 23:43.900]  Kill him.
[23:44.240 --> 23:44.600]  Kill him.
[23:44.700 --> 23:45.000]  Destroy!
[23:46.300 --> 23:46.660]  Smash!
[23:47.180 --> 23:47.500]  Crush!
[23:47.660 --> 23:47.860]  Kill!
[23:48.540 --> 23:48.940]  What?
[23:49.420 --> 23:50.920]  My car sucks.
[23:54.880 --> 23:55.700]  Oh, what did I get?
[23:56.300 --> 23:57.100]  What the hell?
[23:58.440 --> 23:59.500]  It turned me around.
[24:00.100 --> 24:01.020]  I got a little baby.
[24:01.200 --> 24:04.020]  Me and Andrew are in like the same stupid little thing.
[24:06.900 --> 24:08.140]  Oh, now I'm in a milk truck.
[24:09.160 --> 24:09.320]  Milk.
[24:09.600 --> 24:09.840]  Oh, fuck.
[24:09.880 --> 24:10.740]  I'm in like a Lambo.
[24:11.300 --> 24:12.360]  Oh, yeah, I've got some good.
[24:12.800 --> 24:13.420]  Apes going to be.
[24:13.580 --> 24:14.720]  Can I dodge these?
[24:16.400 --> 24:19.140]  Oh, OK, back in the bike.
[24:19.280 --> 24:20.380]  Why am I in a minivan?
[24:31.350 --> 24:32.190]  Hairpin turn.
[24:33.110 --> 24:34.630]  Drift, drift, drift, drift.
[24:35.070 --> 24:36.650]  That's the hairpin turn there, boys.
[24:37.210 --> 24:37.410]  Yeah.
[24:39.470 --> 24:40.710]  What are you in, asshole?
[24:42.130 --> 24:42.610]  Who, me?
[24:43.670 --> 24:44.950]  I have a Tokyo car.
[24:45.070 --> 24:45.370]  I don't know.
[24:46.690 --> 24:47.510]  Oh, fuck.
[24:47.510 --> 24:48.890]  Now I'm in a anus.
[24:50.190 --> 24:51.210]  You're in an anus?
[24:51.450 --> 24:51.930]  I'm in an anus.
[24:51.930 --> 24:53.170]  He's definitely in an anus.
[24:54.430 --> 24:55.670]  Oh, I'm in a dune buggy.
[24:56.070 --> 24:56.970]  Spinning out!
[24:57.750 --> 24:59.430]  I'm in this frickin' turd again.
[25:00.030 --> 25:00.890]  Oh, no, I missed my turn.
[25:00.890 --> 25:02.810]  I'm in a fucking cement truck.
[25:02.910 --> 25:03.750]  What the fuck?
[25:03.770 --> 25:04.750]  Oh, my God.
[25:05.090 --> 25:06.150]  Holy shit.
[25:08.690 --> 25:09.570]  So slow.
[25:10.670 --> 25:11.750]  I had to respawn.
[25:12.050 --> 25:12.650]  There we go.
[25:13.730 --> 25:14.090]  That's good.
[25:14.270 --> 25:14.710]  Flying here.
[25:14.930 --> 25:15.390]  We're flying here.
[25:15.550 --> 25:16.410]  What is this?
[25:16.770 --> 25:17.130]  Hello.
[25:19.970 --> 25:20.550]  Here we go.
[25:20.590 --> 25:20.830]  Here we go.
[25:20.830 --> 25:22.110]  It makes a laser sound.
[25:22.270 --> 25:23.110]  Oh, what is that?
[25:23.230 --> 25:23.430]  All right.
[25:23.470 --> 25:27.210]  That's like you get that for collecting all the space parts, I think.
[25:27.450 --> 25:27.570]  Many.
[25:27.570 --> 25:28.270]  That's pretty cool.
[25:30.930 --> 25:31.650]  All right.
[25:31.770 --> 25:32.490]  Give me something good.
[25:32.770 --> 25:33.050]  Let's get through here.
[25:33.430 --> 25:34.790]  Let's take Gavin out the fucking game.
[25:35.290 --> 25:35.890]  Nah, son.
[25:36.710 --> 25:37.110]  Crush him!
[25:37.290 --> 25:37.630]  Kill him!
[25:37.910 --> 25:38.270]  Smash!
[25:38.430 --> 25:38.650]  Destroy!
[25:45.950 --> 25:46.450]  All right.
[25:46.690 --> 25:48.090]  A lot of butts back here.
[25:53.670 --> 25:55.130]  Oh, oh, no!
[25:55.130 --> 25:55.710]  What is this now?
[25:56.150 --> 25:56.430]  Hello!
[25:57.390 --> 25:59.450]  Oh, I got transformed into a tractor.
[26:00.130 --> 26:01.510]  Oh, this is awful.
[26:01.890 --> 26:02.810]  Oh, I think you can...
[26:02.810 --> 26:03.610]  Oh, it's four laps.
[26:03.850 --> 26:05.470]  I think you can just respawn with Y.
[26:06.550 --> 26:07.810]  Yeah, you get yourself a different...
[26:08.250 --> 26:08.690]  I might...
[26:08.690 --> 26:09.490]  Well, that would have been...
[26:09.490 --> 26:12.210]  That's good to know right before I transform again.
[26:12.290 --> 26:13.430]  Fuck, that's really good to know.
[26:13.870 --> 26:14.930]  No, a trike.
[26:15.850 --> 26:17.570]  Oh, the tractor is tough.
[26:17.990 --> 26:19.150]  Gavin, I will catch you.
[26:19.190 --> 26:19.550]  Oh, shit.
[26:19.970 --> 26:20.630]  Oh, shit.
[26:21.270 --> 26:21.890]  Oh, shit.
[26:22.650 --> 26:23.970]  I can't believe I landed that.
[26:24.870 --> 26:26.210]  Oh my god, there's people coming out of the ground.
[26:27.670 --> 26:28.650]  Oh, left turn.
[26:30.350 --> 26:31.510]  Sneak all through.
[26:32.670 --> 26:34.250]  Who's that in the green car?
[26:34.290 --> 26:35.630]  Fescar, Fescar, Fescar, Fescar.
[26:36.730 --> 26:37.010]  Yeah.
[26:39.070 --> 26:39.550]  Must.
[26:39.930 --> 26:40.310]  Catch.
[26:40.870 --> 26:41.110]  Gavin.
[26:41.910 --> 26:42.170]  Nah.
[26:43.310 --> 26:44.590]  I need some good drops.
[26:45.270 --> 26:46.690]  Had it till it was tractor time.
[26:47.370 --> 26:48.510]  Then I just got bumped all the way back.
[26:48.570 --> 26:49.210]  That was a heartbreaker.
[26:49.210 --> 26:50.790]  I'm driving my nose truck.
[26:53.550 --> 26:54.190]  Here we go.
[26:54.370 --> 26:58.050]  Man, that'd be good to have coming back the other way, just to obliterate fools.
[26:59.270 --> 27:00.130]  No, yeah, no kidding.
[27:00.210 --> 27:00.870]  Fucking jeep.
[27:01.010 --> 27:01.570]  You try it.
[27:01.630 --> 27:02.430]  Oh, this sucks.
[27:07.840 --> 27:08.800]  Oh, here we go.
[27:09.000 --> 27:09.880]  Here we go.
[27:10.840 --> 27:11.600]  Oh, what the hell?
[27:11.840 --> 27:12.200]  No!
[27:13.120 --> 27:13.480]  Batmobile!
[27:14.880 --> 27:15.880]  Oh, you got boost?
[27:16.720 --> 27:19.060]  I did, but then I turned into a fire truck.
[27:19.740 --> 27:20.720]  Ha ha ha.
[27:20.820 --> 27:22.920]  I went from like the fastest to slowest.
[27:23.960 --> 27:25.260]  I think I'm in the Lotus Esprit.
[27:25.600 --> 27:26.000]  No!
[27:29.620 --> 27:31.440]  I'm upside down and I'm a fire truck.
[27:34.720 --> 27:35.420]  Oh my god.
[27:36.460 --> 27:37.320]  Geoff, you might catch up.
[27:37.980 --> 27:38.820]  I'd be nice.
[27:39.320 --> 27:39.700]  You might.
[27:40.380 --> 27:42.700]  I got, I got fucked going into that tunnel.
[27:42.720 --> 27:43.500]  Oh no, I'm in a bike.
[27:43.660 --> 27:44.360]  I'm on a bike.
[27:44.780 --> 27:47.240]  I'm not in a catch-up kind of car, but whatever.
[27:47.380 --> 27:47.720]  Catch him.
[27:48.020 --> 27:48.580]  Catch Gavis.
[27:48.580 --> 27:49.720]  You're an apple bus.
[27:52.380 --> 27:54.320]  Oh, you're way up there.
[27:55.300 --> 27:56.440]  That's why they gave him the bike.
[27:58.860 --> 27:59.300]  Whoopsie.
[28:00.280 --> 28:02.740]  That was, that was dumb.
[28:08.930 --> 28:09.390]  Come on.
[28:09.850 --> 28:11.870]  Take a boost car, boost car, boost car.
[28:12.470 --> 28:13.830]  Come on, give me something fast.
[28:13.990 --> 28:14.830]  Something fast for the end.
[28:14.890 --> 28:15.190]  Yes.
[28:16.670 --> 28:17.630]  I spun out.
[28:19.290 --> 28:19.730]  Hey.
[28:20.470 --> 28:21.310]  Good job, Gavin.
[28:22.150 --> 28:22.610]  I like you.
[28:22.830 --> 28:23.250]  Must.
[28:25.830 --> 28:31.210]  Oh, that was crazy.
[28:31.530 --> 28:33.290]  I got penetrate from behind a ward.
[28:37.030 --> 28:38.910]  Y'all fucking hear what he did to Michael?
[28:40.230 --> 28:40.670]  It's crazy.
[28:47.610 --> 28:50.670]  Hey, that was nice of them to give me something like this, shitty Geoff.
[28:50.670 --> 28:53.650]  I'll be there in a minute, guys, in the garbage truck.
[28:54.370 --> 28:55.290]  I'm hauling...
[28:55.290 --> 28:57.130]  The bot love his garbage truck.
[28:57.630 --> 29:00.310]  I'm hauling my garbage run in the garbage truck.
[29:00.430 --> 29:00.870]  Hold on.
[29:01.090 --> 29:02.090]  There we go.
[29:04.990 --> 29:10.930]  I would love, like, a relegation system in F1 and, like, a garbage truck gets to the upper level.
[29:11.410 --> 29:14.970]  Everyone else in fancy cars, just one garbage truck on the track.
[29:17.410 --> 29:21.110]  Yeah, I should leave Stramtam.
[29:21.250 --> 29:22.750]  Gavin in first place again.
[29:23.190 --> 29:23.270]  Man.
[29:23.650 --> 29:24.510]  Won my bet again.
[29:25.290 --> 29:27.650]  This is how I make back all my mugged money, I think.
[29:28.710 --> 29:29.430]  Third place.
[29:30.030 --> 29:31.670]  Keep reminding me about the mugging, okay?
[29:31.750 --> 29:31.990]  Thanks.
[29:35.210 --> 29:35.570]  Andrew.
[29:36.050 --> 29:36.750]  Yeah, I hit it.
[29:36.870 --> 29:37.390]  I hit it.
[29:37.890 --> 29:38.250]  Relax.
[29:39.010 --> 29:39.530]  I'm sorry.
[29:39.530 --> 29:45.450]  I'm immediately back into fucking year, like, 14 of Achievement Hunters, just to pay attention
[29:45.450 --> 29:46.590]  long enough to get the game started.
[29:47.550 --> 29:48.430]  This is the last one.
[29:48.950 --> 29:49.870]  It's not on y'all.
[29:49.930 --> 29:50.350]  It's on me.
[29:50.810 --> 29:51.610]  This is the final one.
[29:51.970 --> 29:52.730]  Dang, all right.
[29:53.110 --> 29:57.050]  Because it's also the thing with this game where there's an invisible idle timer that
[29:57.050 --> 29:59.030]  just boots you out of the game permanently.
[29:59.610 --> 30:00.130]  There we go.
[30:00.150 --> 30:00.730]  Doing the same car.
[30:01.150 --> 30:01.990]  All right, which car?
[30:02.170 --> 30:02.750]  Which one do you guys want to do?
[30:02.830 --> 30:03.090]  Which car?
[30:04.030 --> 30:05.330]  I think it should be the Vizion.
[30:06.350 --> 30:08.250]  Vizion, Brody Vizion, whatever that thing.
[30:08.630 --> 30:09.130]  You guys cool with that?
[30:09.130 --> 30:09.910]  Yeah.
[30:11.390 --> 30:13.290]  All right, we're in rat mode right now.
[30:13.910 --> 30:15.250]  I think it's my toast.
[30:15.510 --> 30:15.710]  Toast for what?
[30:18.850 --> 30:21.790]  All right, ready...
[30:21.790 --> 30:22.070]  Damn it.
[30:22.230 --> 30:22.450]  Here!
[30:23.630 --> 30:24.150]  Nailed it.
[30:24.490 --> 30:25.290]  Fuck, I'm saluting.
[30:26.010 --> 30:26.810]  How do you keep nailing it?
[30:26.810 --> 30:27.770]  I believe in this great nation.
[30:31.310 --> 30:32.630]  Rat time, let's go!
[30:33.090 --> 30:34.310]  What the hell is this bullshit?
[30:35.870 --> 30:36.650]  What's the bullshit?
[30:37.470 --> 30:38.090]  I'm in the back.
[30:39.150 --> 30:39.890]  Well, you suck.
[30:41.010 --> 30:42.670]  I beat your ass last time.
[30:43.190 --> 30:45.990]  They viewed you as such a threat, they had to put you in the back.
[30:46.070 --> 30:46.810]  Well, that's fair.
[30:46.950 --> 30:47.470]  Enjoy the middle.
[30:48.450 --> 30:49.110]  The middle?
[30:49.410 --> 30:50.390]  Come and ride up your asshole.
[30:52.590 --> 30:53.410]  He's not Michael.
[30:57.630 --> 30:59.570]  They sound the same!
[31:00.050 --> 31:00.870]  Oh, that's a good point.
[31:02.230 --> 31:02.610]  Oh, yeah.
[31:04.590 --> 31:04.990]  I want that yellow paint.
[31:04.990 --> 31:05.830]  Get your fucking ears checked.
[31:08.530 --> 31:09.510]  Oh, hi, Andrew.
[31:09.850 --> 31:11.970]  Oh, that just didn't work for me at all.
[31:12.070 --> 31:13.390]  No, that's what I get.
[31:13.690 --> 31:16.030]  That was, yeah, that was a good card.
[31:16.810 --> 31:18.130]  You've killed me.
[31:18.690 --> 31:20.930]  Oh, what the?
[31:21.970 --> 31:26.510]  Wow, and I restocked from a standstill.
[31:26.690 --> 31:28.610]  Oh my god, where are we supposed to go?
[31:28.750 --> 31:29.330]  Where am I going?
[31:30.170 --> 31:31.530]  Where am I going?
[31:32.950 --> 31:34.730]  To the marker, you fool.
[31:36.230 --> 31:37.990]  A fool there from Nick.
[31:39.550 --> 31:41.250]  Who's this parachute in the middle of?
[31:41.250 --> 31:41.470]  Me!
[31:44.050 --> 31:44.770]  Oh, fuck!
[31:45.250 --> 31:46.090]  Oh, shit.
[31:46.910 --> 31:48.930]  I don't know what the fuck I was supposed to do.
[31:49.890 --> 31:52.850]  Well, you sure as shit didn't need to open your shoe at any point there.
[31:53.230 --> 31:54.490]  I didn't know where I was going.
[31:54.650 --> 31:55.530]  I couldn't see it.
[31:55.990 --> 31:56.610]  It's on the map.
[31:56.770 --> 31:58.670]  I went face first to the building.
[31:59.690 --> 32:00.690]  Who just tried to hit me?
[32:00.810 --> 32:02.650]  That was, well, I didn't know you were coming that way.
[32:04.810 --> 32:05.610]  Oh, he's on the map.
[32:05.830 --> 32:06.490]  Take that.
[32:08.010 --> 32:08.810]  Wait a second.
[32:09.030 --> 32:10.450]  Why am I taking all the shit?
[32:10.670 --> 32:11.830]  Andrew's back here with me.
[32:11.970 --> 32:12.670]  No, I just passed.
[32:12.830 --> 32:13.410]  I passed you.
[32:14.310 --> 32:15.970]  Did Andrew, did you get lost as well?
[32:16.370 --> 32:17.570]  No, I knew what I was doing.
[32:17.630 --> 32:18.350]  I just failed at it.
[32:18.450 --> 32:19.070]  I hit the building.
[32:20.670 --> 32:23.010]  Oh, that, I'll be honest, that's worse.
[32:25.250 --> 32:27.490]  Oh, this plane, this cross-traffic plane-age.
[32:27.950 --> 32:28.370]  Okay, dude.
[32:28.370 --> 32:30.810]  I feel like you just described my entire life, Andrew.
[32:30.990 --> 32:31.890]  I knew exactly what to do.
[32:31.970 --> 32:33.050]  I just fucking sucked.
[32:36.770 --> 32:38.930]  Hey, oh, oh.
[32:39.970 --> 32:42.210]  Man, this takes a gentle touch.
[32:43.150 --> 32:44.010]  What is happening?
[32:44.190 --> 32:44.670]  Oh, my God.
[32:46.150 --> 32:47.550]  Oh, that was disorienting.
[32:48.590 --> 32:49.670]  It sure was.
[32:50.470 --> 32:52.550]  Oh, Geoff, is that you up there?
[32:52.950 --> 32:53.290]  No.
[32:54.970 --> 32:56.650]  What a stupid question.
[32:57.750 --> 32:58.530]  Okay, then it's you.
[33:04.150 --> 33:05.690]  You did that to me.
[33:05.690 --> 33:06.390]  You know that, right?
[33:06.970 --> 33:07.290]  No.
[33:07.870 --> 33:08.490]  Yeah, you did.
[33:08.810 --> 33:09.210]  Yeah, you did.
[33:09.230 --> 33:09.650]  No, I'm sorry.
[33:10.090 --> 33:13.450]  You called attention to what I was doing and you freaked me out.
[33:15.490 --> 33:17.610]  And made me sabotage myself.
[33:17.770 --> 33:18.730]  And now I'm in third place.
[33:19.870 --> 33:20.970]  Shit, I'm sorry, man.
[33:20.970 --> 33:22.370]  No, it's the whole point of it.
[33:22.370 --> 33:23.870]  I was sitting pretty in first for a long time.
[33:24.650 --> 33:27.070]  I only got there because I fucked Gavin over.
[33:29.150 --> 33:30.790]  It's about time I get my comeuppance.
[33:31.330 --> 33:31.690]  Not fair.
[33:33.450 --> 33:33.850]  Comeuppance.
[33:33.850 --> 33:35.790]  What if we sold pens called comeuppence?
[33:35.990 --> 33:36.730]  Oh, what happened?
[33:37.050 --> 33:37.310]  Wrong way?
[33:37.670 --> 33:39.670]  I'm not selling pens for this show anymore.
[33:39.910 --> 33:40.490]  I'm done.
[33:41.070 --> 33:41.470]  Comeuppence.
[33:42.370 --> 33:43.990]  I kind of like comeuppence.
[33:44.450 --> 33:45.830]  I don't like it at all.
[33:46.210 --> 33:46.710]  I love it.
[33:46.770 --> 33:47.610]  I think we should do it.
[33:48.410 --> 33:49.270]  All right, sounds like we're in.
[33:50.390 --> 33:51.830]  What the fuck is this thing?
[33:53.230 --> 33:53.510]  Oh.
[33:54.310 --> 33:55.710]  How did I end up going the wrong way?
[33:55.810 --> 33:57.530]  Did my game break or did I stupid?
[33:58.490 --> 33:59.790]  Yeah, I think the second one.
[34:00.250 --> 34:01.230]  Definitely probably the game.
[34:02.930 --> 34:03.250]  Ugh.
[34:05.790 --> 34:07.250]  Man, I am in a solid fifth.
[34:08.710 --> 34:09.670]  Feel the same way about fourth.
[34:09.670 --> 34:11.070]  Well, Gavin killed himself, so you might be able to gain.
[34:14.470 --> 34:15.750]  Holy shit, some of this food got me.
[34:15.750 --> 34:17.150]  A lot of plane cross traffic, huh?
[34:17.790 --> 34:18.010]  Yeah.
[34:18.650 --> 34:19.550]  Oh, a car again.
[34:19.650 --> 34:19.970]  Sweet.
[34:21.870 --> 34:22.830]  I'll let you know when I get there.
[34:22.850 --> 34:23.650]  Make a note when...
[34:23.650 --> 34:24.350]  Yeah, exactly.
[34:26.730 --> 34:27.770]  Countdown from this moment.
[34:28.290 --> 34:28.610]  Car!
[34:29.410 --> 34:35.770]  We should do one of these races like it's F1 and make it like 76 laps.
[34:35.790 --> 34:36.510]  You suck.
[34:37.490 --> 34:38.050]  Yeah, let's do it.
[34:38.090 --> 34:40.970]  And it's like a two hour, like you're in it for the day.
[34:41.170 --> 34:42.290]  Just like, it's like fucking...
[34:42.290 --> 34:43.250]  That's awful.
[34:43.610 --> 34:44.370]  I hate it.
[34:44.870 --> 34:47.690]  We should all turn up the heating in our houses to make it like...
[34:48.990 --> 34:50.250]  Turn up the heating.
[34:50.730 --> 34:53.210]  We'll all lose like three pounds of water.
[34:56.270 --> 34:57.910]  Wow, I cannot catch up to second.
[34:59.250 --> 35:00.850]  Dude, I'm in fifth!
[35:05.100 --> 35:06.160]  Oh no, I'm fucked up.
[35:06.400 --> 35:07.340]  I fucked up hard.
[35:08.600 --> 35:10.720]  Did you pull your parachute too soon too?
[35:11.700 --> 35:13.100]  Yeah, I pulled it all.
[35:13.380 --> 35:19.960]  I didn't need it last time, but I fucked up my trajectory so I had to use it and I hit a building.
[35:20.460 --> 35:21.060]  I jeffed it.
[35:21.260 --> 35:21.760]  I jeffed it hard.
[35:21.780 --> 35:23.840]  Gavin, angrily screaming, you don't need the chute!
[35:24.780 --> 35:26.380]  You do if you play like I do.
[35:27.860 --> 35:29.400]  Oh wow, you really don't need the chute.
[35:32.080 --> 35:32.980]  I'm in fourth.
[35:34.060 --> 35:34.480]  Geoff.
[35:36.700 --> 35:38.820]  Just ping-ponged off buildings like a...
[35:38.820 --> 35:39.780]  Just fucking jeffed.
[35:39.780 --> 35:41.280]  Dude, he just jeffed it so bad.
[35:41.600 --> 35:42.480]  Wow, I ever took someone?
[35:42.760 --> 35:43.440]  Where was third?
[35:44.920 --> 35:45.740]  Who's third now?
[35:46.400 --> 35:46.980]  I'm third now.
[35:47.180 --> 35:47.540]  Probably Andrew.
[35:50.860 --> 35:51.700]  Geoff crashed.
[35:54.840 --> 35:58.340]  Uh-oh, I'm coming to the spot where Geoff spun out and now I'm overthinking it.
[35:59.140 --> 36:00.300]  Are you overthinking it, Nick?
[36:01.040 --> 36:01.520]  Huh?
[36:01.760 --> 36:01.960]  What?
[36:02.380 --> 36:03.900]  It's so easy to fuck up, Nick.
[36:04.480 --> 36:05.380]  Gotta be careful.
[36:05.840 --> 36:07.040]  Why are the touchdowns fast?
[36:08.820 --> 36:10.080]  Okay, all right.
[36:10.120 --> 36:11.160]  This is exactly the spot.
[36:11.400 --> 36:12.620]  What the fuck am I doing?
[36:13.740 --> 36:13.980]  All right.
[36:19.980 --> 36:21.860]  That's fucking upside down.
[36:22.320 --> 36:24.100]  Okay, so who's first?
[36:24.240 --> 36:24.480]  Nick?
[36:25.220 --> 36:25.640]  Yes.
[36:26.040 --> 36:26.920]  What are you doing up there?
[36:27.860 --> 36:29.260]  I'm flying, man.
[36:29.260 --> 36:31.020]  Can you like hit something or do something?
[36:32.500 --> 36:33.340]  Uh, sure.
[36:33.900 --> 36:34.320]  Oh, I missed.
[36:34.520 --> 36:34.960]  Oh, you know what?
[36:35.200 --> 36:35.420]  Sure.
[36:36.540 --> 36:37.660]  I'll get right off.
[36:37.840 --> 36:38.960]  Yeah, we'll get right on it.
[36:41.060 --> 36:42.800]  I got 500 bucks riding on this.
[36:45.780 --> 36:47.600]  I think the game started me with like...
[36:47.600 --> 36:47.760]  Oh shit!
[36:48.080 --> 36:48.620]  Oh shit!
[36:48.820 --> 36:49.260]  Oh shit!
[36:49.500 --> 36:49.600]  Uh-oh!
[36:49.800 --> 36:50.120]  Uh-oh!
[36:50.340 --> 36:50.620]  Uh-oh!
[36:50.720 --> 36:51.120]  Oh no!
[36:51.400 --> 36:51.700]  Oh no!
[36:52.100 --> 36:52.160]  Nick.
[36:53.460 --> 36:54.740]  Nick, you have to win.
[36:55.540 --> 36:56.440]  I gotta respawn.
[36:57.000 --> 36:57.420]  No!
[36:57.460 --> 36:58.700]  Oh, you fuck.
[37:00.360 --> 37:00.960]  Where's Gavin?
[37:01.120 --> 37:01.860]  Okay, still ahead.
[37:02.160 --> 37:03.380]  Oh, I see you now.
[37:03.940 --> 37:04.400]  No!
[37:07.460 --> 37:08.380]  Oh no!
[37:08.840 --> 37:09.420]  Oh no.
[37:10.820 --> 37:11.840]  Oh, there we go.
[37:11.900 --> 37:12.620]  I crashed.
[37:15.620 --> 37:16.400]  Hell yeah.
[37:16.620 --> 37:17.840]  I was hoping I'd do that.
[37:18.580 --> 37:18.880]  Gavin?
[37:19.300 --> 37:19.740]  Yeah, what's up?
[37:20.620 --> 37:21.100]  I see you.
[37:21.200 --> 37:21.740]  You're too close.
[37:21.940 --> 37:22.260]  No like.
[37:22.600 --> 37:22.980]  Oh shit!
[37:23.580 --> 37:24.120]  Oh shit!
[37:24.200 --> 37:24.500]  Cross traffic.
[37:26.140 --> 37:27.100]  Kill them all.
[37:28.360 --> 37:28.820]  Car.
[37:28.820 --> 37:31.080]  Look for the finish line.
[37:31.140 --> 37:31.340]  No!
[37:34.420 --> 37:34.740]  Damn.
[37:35.520 --> 37:35.840]  Nice, Nick.
[37:35.840 --> 37:36.540]  Nick, did you do it?
[37:37.080 --> 37:37.800]  You were really close.
[37:37.800 --> 37:38.540]  I did, I did, I did.
[37:38.540 --> 37:38.920]  Way to go.
[37:38.960 --> 37:39.420]  Good job, Nick.
[37:39.680 --> 37:40.480]  That was close at the end.
[37:41.800 --> 37:43.480]  Give me four more laps and I would have had you.
[37:44.700 --> 37:46.480]  What about 74 more laps?
[37:46.560 --> 37:47.860]  Yeah, how about 74 more laps?
[37:48.380 --> 37:49.360]  I would have tossed it by then.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.060]  All right, boys.
[37:52.240 --> 37:52.800]  We did it.
[37:53.320 --> 37:53.620]  We finished.
[37:53.780 --> 37:54.800]  Hell of some races.
[37:54.940 --> 37:55.460]  That was fun.
[37:56.480 --> 37:56.960]  Woo!
[37:57.960 --> 37:59.760]  Well, at least Gavin didn't win every single one of them.
[38:00.460 --> 38:00.860]  Yeah.
[38:01.380 --> 38:02.300]  I stopped him.
[38:02.820 --> 38:03.300]  Whoa.
[38:06.260 --> 38:07.440]  Hey, guys, wait up.
[38:08.040 --> 38:09.060]  Guys, wait up.
[38:09.760 --> 38:10.520]  Guys, wait up.
[38:11.040 --> 38:11.320]  Guys.
[38:11.500 --> 38:12.520]  Sitting on your wing is horrifying.
[38:12.520 --> 38:13.760]  Don't go home yet, guys.
[38:13.800 --> 38:14.440]  I'm still here.
[38:16.060 --> 38:16.880]  Hey, guys.
[38:19.140 --> 38:20.220]  I didn't finish.
[38:21.980 --> 38:25.300]  Oh, do I lose all my betting money?
[38:25.300 --> 38:25.980]  Damn.
[38:26.580 --> 38:28.480]  Well, you've done it again.
[38:28.640 --> 38:33.860]  You've wasted another perfectly good hour watching us play video games.
[38:34.020 --> 38:34.720]  You fool.
[38:35.340 --> 38:36.520]  That's the car talk ending.
[38:37.020 --> 38:38.120]  Click and clack ending.
[38:38.760 --> 38:39.200]  Oh, wow.
[38:40.020 --> 38:42.520]  Speaking of car talk, that's a radio show.
[38:42.700 --> 38:44.840]  Speaking of radio, the new version of that is podcasting.
[38:44.920 --> 38:46.460]  Speaking of podcasts, we have one.
[38:46.580 --> 38:47.640]  It's called The Regulation Podcast.
[38:47.860 --> 38:48.700]  You should listen to it.
[38:48.900 --> 38:53.420]  If you like it, maybe even go to patreon.com slash The Regulation Pod and check it out.
[38:53.940 --> 38:54.600]  It's, uh...
[38:54.600 --> 38:55.380]  I give it an A+.
[38:55.380 --> 38:56.060]  You know what?
[38:56.440 --> 38:58.100]  I feel like a lot of people are gonna think I'm biased,
[38:58.240 --> 39:00.100]  but I watch a lot of media and I try to be unbiased.
[39:00.160 --> 39:02.420]  I give it an A+, and I feel like that's an unbiased A+.
[39:02.420 --> 39:03.280]  Yeah, I agree. I think that's fair.
[39:03.900 --> 39:05.540]  I'd love to see what you think about it.
[39:05.720 --> 39:06.480]  Uh, check it out.
[39:07.120 --> 39:08.160]  You fucking losers.
[39:08.780 --> 39:08.920]  Boo!
[39:09.460 --> 39:09.840]  There's Gavin.
[39:09.840 --> 39:10.960]  Oh, I lost it at the end.
[39:10.980 --> 39:11.760]  I lost it at the end.
[39:11.780 --> 39:13.540]  I was doing so well, and then I said the bad thing.
[39:14.020 --> 39:14.300]  Bye.
