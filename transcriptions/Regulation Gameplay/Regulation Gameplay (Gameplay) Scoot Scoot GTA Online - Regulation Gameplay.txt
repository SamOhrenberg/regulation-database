[00:01.840 --> 00:03.840]  Wow, look at this.
[00:04.400 --> 00:06.400]  A.H. scoot scoot king of the hill.
[00:07.180 --> 00:08.060]  It's real?
[00:08.660 --> 00:09.140]  Thanks, Matt.
[00:10.120 --> 00:11.000]  Holy shit.
[00:11.600 --> 00:12.280]  Oh, whoa.
[00:13.380 --> 00:14.480]  So what is this?
[00:15.200 --> 00:19.040]  Uh, it's you just have to stay on the faggio for as long as possible.
[00:19.640 --> 00:20.160]  And then what?
[00:20.620 --> 00:24.900]  What are you what's trying to make me not be on it? A hammer from everyone else.
[00:26.440 --> 00:30.540]  Oh, we're like swinging at each other? Oh, big time. Oh, cool.
[00:30.540 --> 00:34.320]  Oh, this is so cool. This is a whole Matt Bragg thing. I never played.
[00:34.740 --> 00:36.400]  Okay, let's get it going. We're all here.
[00:37.060 --> 00:40.700]  I'm really looking forward to the seven Let's Plays that people send me that I was in.
[00:43.220 --> 00:44.740]  That was like...
[00:44.740 --> 00:46.320]  Well, sometimes Matt would come in
[00:46.760 --> 00:49.420]  uh, and we'd expect to do something and then he would load it up and be like,
[00:49.500 --> 00:53.060]  Oh, I didn't look. And we would resort to a bit of scoot scoot because it was fun.
[00:53.360 --> 00:57.080]  Yeah, I think I've I think I've never played this, but I'll know for sure in a little bit.
[00:57.140 --> 00:59.880]  We played something similar to this in GTA 4.
[01:01.020 --> 01:02.560]  In that little baseball...
[01:02.560 --> 01:07.180]  You remember that little circular area where we had baseball bats on Lost in the Damned DLC and we'd whack each other?
[01:07.760 --> 01:07.980]  Yeah.
[01:08.820 --> 01:11.320]  Oh, I just put on an invisible helmet. I'm still putting it on.
[01:13.360 --> 01:14.080]  I don't...
[01:14.080 --> 01:15.520]  So we're just supposed to like hit each other?
[01:16.120 --> 01:18.220]  Go to the crown. You want the crown on the map?
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.520]  Crown? Oh, okay. I'm going the wrong way for the crown. It's the hill. It's king of the hill. Oh.
[01:24.080 --> 01:24.980]  The hill is on wheels.
[01:25.980 --> 01:27.920]  And how do you swing a hammer on a bike?
[01:27.920 --> 01:30.240]  Uh, it's a bumper. Hit Y.
[01:31.980 --> 01:36.420]  Hold Y for boots. I almost... you son of a... you almost got me. Hey, where are you going?
[01:37.840 --> 01:40.560]  Going for the... going for the crown. Where's the... where is this?
[01:42.220 --> 01:43.640]  Okay, I think I think I see.
[01:44.460 --> 01:45.320]  Going for the crown.
[01:47.060 --> 01:48.160]  Shit, Nick, get away!
[01:49.540 --> 01:55.140]  Oh, X and X in the bumpers. Hold X and left and right bumper is left and right swing. Whoa. Oh, cool.
[01:56.060 --> 01:56.460]  Complicated.
[01:56.920 --> 01:59.860]  Oh, Andrew, you lost a fraction of a second on that. Oh, I did too.
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.640]  Oh, we're gonna be... we're gonna be in trouble. Oh, no, somebody else. Yeah. I got the hill, bitches. Why am I...
[02:07.840 --> 02:10.200]  Get on my... get the bike. Woo!
[02:10.940 --> 02:12.020]  My bike! Shit.
[02:16.930 --> 02:18.530]  I need this. Hey, what's up, bitch?
[02:19.910 --> 02:22.910]  Did I get him? Went down. No!
[02:25.290 --> 02:28.090]  So now what? Oh, you have to get the bike? Yeah.
[02:28.210 --> 02:29.990]  Yeah, you get on the bike.
[02:32.290 --> 02:36.210]  Let me out, let me out. Oh, no, get away! Kill him! Kill that guy!
[02:48.450 --> 02:50.050]  Come here, you rat bitch!
[02:52.210 --> 02:54.770]  Sorry, Nick!
[02:58.210 --> 03:01.550]  It had to be done! It had to be done! Get to my speed there. That was fun.
[03:04.330 --> 03:17.470]  No, wrong bike, you moron. Good job, Gavin! So you can swing while on the bike. Yes, that's the whole point.
[03:17.510 --> 03:21.830]  No, you hit me! I hit you? How did I hit you?
[03:24.150 --> 03:26.230]  You hold X and you press the bumpers.
[03:27.690 --> 03:30.110]  Woo! The hill was lost. No!
[03:31.910 --> 03:34.570]  Must recapture hill.
[03:35.090 --> 03:38.310]  Do we have to stay like up on the boardwalk?
[03:39.770 --> 03:40.590]  Nope, you can go anywhere.
[03:42.570 --> 03:48.650]  I don't think my control scheme is the same as yours. I don't think so either. I can swing the hammer only the Thagio can.
[03:49.350 --> 03:50.770]  No, no, you can swing the hammer.
[03:51.470 --> 03:55.990]  Ow! You hold X. On the bike? Yes, you hold X and then you hit. I'm holding X.
[03:56.370 --> 03:58.870]  No, it doesn't do that for me. All right, let's figure out the controls.
[03:59.430 --> 04:01.850]  You've got different, uh... I'm doing it right now.
[04:02.490 --> 04:07.670]  Yeah, I hold X and then I press left and right bumpers. See? It works. I'm doing the same thing. Nothing's happening.
[04:10.310 --> 04:10.670]  See?
[04:13.790 --> 04:16.270]  Well, let's have the other people figure out how to do it.
[04:17.330 --> 04:18.330]  And then we'll resume.
[04:19.110 --> 04:23.530]  Hold A and click the left or right bumper. Try that. Oh, it's A. It's A. Okay.
[04:23.530 --> 04:26.690]  So you have you have your hand, you don't have your handbrake switched. Yeah.
[04:27.170 --> 04:34.270]  I'm with you, Gavin. Resume! Now we're in it. I hope this rat is ready to fucking die. No! Rat's ready to live, baby!
[04:34.710 --> 04:35.930]  Live, rat, live!
[04:37.050 --> 04:42.650]  Live, rat! Ow, ow, ow. Are you, were you on the... oh, you're not. Where's the hell is... oh!
[04:42.770 --> 04:43.230]  Rat life!
[04:47.730 --> 04:48.550]  Oh! Oh, shit!
[04:49.550 --> 04:51.930]  Oh, get my bike out. Oh, no!
[04:51.930 --> 04:52.030]  No! No!
[04:56.830 --> 04:59.010]  Stop him! Get him! Get him!
[05:00.710 --> 05:02.450]  Die! Die, the liar!
[05:03.850 --> 05:05.090]  Get out of here! Ow!
[05:05.970 --> 05:08.070]  Where'd the bike go? I'm just getting this off the fucking hammer!
[05:08.890 --> 05:13.550]  He'll respawn. Oh, shit! Oh, Geoff! Ow!
[05:15.750 --> 05:18.010]  Go, rat, go, go, rat, go! Go, rat, go!
[05:20.530 --> 05:21.550]  Kill the rat!
[05:22.590 --> 05:23.210]  And Eric's winning.
[05:23.570 --> 05:24.270]  Come on, rat!
[05:25.950 --> 05:27.910]  That's because you sat on the bike while we figured out control skills.
[05:29.350 --> 05:32.050]  Oh, shit! I thought I'd be able to bank those stairs!
[05:32.170 --> 05:32.490]  Ah!
[05:33.170 --> 05:34.450]  Where'd he go? Oh!
[05:35.530 --> 05:36.410]  Someone's taking it!
[05:36.430 --> 05:37.230]  That's not the bike!
[05:40.590 --> 05:41.470]  There goes Gavin!
[05:42.470 --> 05:43.770]  I'll see you guys later.
[05:43.930 --> 05:45.390]  I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him.
[05:45.510 --> 05:45.830]  Ow!
[05:45.830 --> 05:46.030]  Get him!
[05:51.140 --> 05:51.660]  Ah!
[05:52.020 --> 05:52.600]  It's mine!
[05:55.180 --> 05:56.220]  It's mine for the taking!
[05:56.460 --> 05:57.980]  Not me, you idiot! Get him!
[05:57.980 --> 05:58.880]  It's mine for the taking!
[06:01.820 --> 06:02.900]  How'd he do that?
[06:03.620 --> 06:05.200]  He's getting that little MF'er!
[06:07.820 --> 06:08.720]  Oh, it's Gavin!
[06:08.980 --> 06:09.620]  Oh, get away!
[06:14.900 --> 06:16.140]  How'd he do that?
[06:16.140 --> 06:17.920]  I launched him into the air!
[06:18.240 --> 06:19.060]  How'd I do that?
[06:19.920 --> 06:21.340]  He's got superior tactics!
[06:22.460 --> 06:23.560]  I'll cut him off at the pier!
[06:24.660 --> 06:26.080]  I'm going up on the rollercoaster!
[06:26.580 --> 06:27.600]  Bastard man!
[06:28.080 --> 06:28.760]  Oh, shit!
[06:29.980 --> 06:30.520]  Get away!
[06:31.880 --> 06:32.600]  Where is he?
[06:33.720 --> 06:36.380]  He's on the backside of the Ferris wheel.
[06:36.800 --> 06:37.980]  No! Get away, Geoff!
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.920]  Smash his stupid face!
[06:40.360 --> 06:42.080]  He's up there!
[06:42.380 --> 06:45.920]  I'm trying to get on the Ferris wheel!
[06:46.440 --> 06:47.520]  Oh, damn it!
[06:47.860 --> 06:48.100]  Ah!
[06:49.140 --> 06:51.280]  No, you just kicked me in the leg!
[06:54.920 --> 06:57.340]  Oh, shit!
[06:59.160 --> 07:00.320]  This is a nightmare!
[07:00.600 --> 07:01.180]  Go, Rat, go!
[07:01.740 --> 07:03.740]  Die, you rat bitch!
[07:07.620 --> 07:09.880]  Oh, god!
[07:09.880 --> 07:11.000]  Oh, shit!
[07:11.620 --> 07:12.620]  Where'd my hammer go?
[07:12.980 --> 07:16.200]  Yeah! King of the hill!
[07:17.440 --> 07:18.880]  Get on the bike!
[07:20.340 --> 07:22.720]  Get out of here, you little...
[07:24.260 --> 07:26.260]  Is it still stuck up the stairs?
[07:26.740 --> 07:27.800]  I'm under it!
[07:28.240 --> 07:28.540]  Whoops!
[07:30.200 --> 07:31.180]  Hey, Nick, hold on.
[07:32.220 --> 07:33.160]  I'm sorry, Geoff.
[07:33.900 --> 07:34.660]  I got it.
[07:35.480 --> 07:36.260]  Hold on a second.
[07:37.540 --> 07:38.080]  I forgot.
[07:38.280 --> 07:39.380]  I just need you to die real fast.
[07:40.140 --> 07:41.880]  I need Andrew to die real fast.
[07:41.980 --> 07:43.180]  Andrew, I'm gonna need you to die real fast.
[07:44.060 --> 07:45.260]  Ah, damn it!
[07:49.100 --> 07:49.900]  Get away!
[07:50.040 --> 07:51.960]  Get out of here, you little...
[07:52.840 --> 07:54.760]  It's a massacre up here!
[07:55.420 --> 07:56.980]  Why do I keep falling down?
[07:57.940 --> 07:58.780]  I'm like Michael Douglas.
[07:59.060 --> 08:00.080]  I'm not even on the starting thing!
[08:02.260 --> 08:03.960]  This is so stupid!
[08:06.520 --> 08:07.720]  Jesus Christ!
[08:09.600 --> 08:12.540]  There's five people smashing each other with a hammer!
[08:13.420 --> 08:14.580]  Oh, respawn!
[08:15.180 --> 08:15.580]  Hell yeah.
[08:19.460 --> 08:21.260]  Andrew's plan was always good.
[08:23.520 --> 08:24.520]  God damn it.
[08:27.990 --> 08:29.390]  Hey, hey, what if you didn't...
[08:29.390 --> 08:29.710]  No!
[08:37.650 --> 08:38.470]  Don't mind me!
[08:39.650 --> 08:41.430]  Oh, Gavin's body fucked me up!
[08:47.370 --> 08:47.910]  No!
[08:50.920 --> 08:51.400]  No!
[08:53.700 --> 08:54.640]  Kill the rat!
[08:57.320 --> 08:57.920]  Yes!
[09:01.040 --> 09:02.640]  Come here, you slow bastard!
[09:03.120 --> 09:03.720]  Yes!
[09:05.060 --> 09:06.920]  No, I'm on the roof!
[09:07.580 --> 09:09.520]  If he'd stayed on the roof, he would've had it.
[09:09.760 --> 09:11.040]  I tried to bump me out.
[09:11.560 --> 09:13.100]  That was so close!
[09:13.150 --> 09:13.680]  No!
[09:16.040 --> 09:17.420]  Where's he going?
[09:17.960 --> 09:18.780]  I'm roadkill!
[09:20.560 --> 09:24.240]  Give me this.
[09:32.460 --> 09:35.740]  I'll see you later, bitches!
[09:38.620 --> 09:39.320]  Bye, bye!
[09:39.320 --> 09:39.420]  No!
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.240]  Sneak it away!
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.560]  I'm done, you losers!
[09:46.820 --> 09:47.700]  Oh, God!
[09:48.280 --> 09:51.340]  You road warrior me!
[09:51.440 --> 09:52.300]  You Mad Max me!
[09:52.560 --> 09:54.100]  I'm his wife and kid!
[09:54.700 --> 09:56.840]  Andrew, please!
[09:57.320 --> 09:57.780]  Get away!
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.040]  Kick me to death!
[10:03.680 --> 10:04.320]  No!
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.800]  Oh, my God!
[10:09.800 --> 10:10.960]  What the...
[10:10.960 --> 10:12.160]  Oh, fuck!
[10:12.380 --> 10:13.320]  You murdered me, Nick.
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.900]  Sorry, I was trying to get Gavin to watch.
[10:19.380 --> 10:20.320]  Who's got it?
[10:20.860 --> 10:21.280]  No one.
[10:27.950 --> 10:29.730]  Son of a...
[10:29.730 --> 10:30.790]  No!
[10:31.790 --> 10:32.290]  No!
[10:32.610 --> 10:33.170]  Come on!
[10:33.450 --> 10:38.910]  Oh, this is bullshit!
[10:39.170 --> 10:39.570]  Go, rat, go!
[10:41.130 --> 10:42.410]  The rat might...
[10:42.410 --> 10:44.830]  I might have fucked myself.
[10:45.970 --> 10:46.590]  Kill the rat!
[10:46.750 --> 10:47.190]  Kill the rat!
[10:49.270 --> 10:49.570]  Yes!
[10:55.190 --> 10:56.570]  I have done myself in.
[10:56.890 --> 10:57.370]  Alright, here we go.
[10:57.930 --> 10:58.350]  Ah!
[11:00.410 --> 11:04.030]  Oh, you little...
[11:04.030 --> 11:04.790]  Little rat.
[11:08.360 --> 11:09.220]  Oh, I'm gonna...
[11:09.220 --> 11:10.480]  I'm gonna bash you good.
[11:12.520 --> 11:13.460]  Andrew's getting it!
[11:14.620 --> 11:16.120]  As long as Eric doesn't have it,
[11:16.180 --> 11:16.320]  he's about to win.
[11:16.320 --> 11:18.040]  As long as Eric doesn't get it, who gives a shit?
[11:19.520 --> 11:20.880]  Oh, get away, get away, get away.
[11:21.280 --> 11:22.100]  I'm so slow!
[11:22.640 --> 11:24.560]  Yeah, this thing is so slow.
[11:25.240 --> 11:25.940]  I'm so slow!
[11:25.940 --> 11:28.360]  Ow, ow, ow, ow!
[11:31.300 --> 11:33.220]  You pinned me up against the wall
[11:33.220 --> 11:34.680]  and then just hammered me.
[11:40.460 --> 11:43.740]  Oh, yes!
[11:44.220 --> 11:44.760]  Yes, freedom!
[11:45.420 --> 11:45.980]  Freedom!
[11:47.400 --> 11:49.100]  I'm off, you'll never see me again!
[11:49.300 --> 11:51.440]  That was my bite, you stole my bite!
[11:51.640 --> 11:52.480]  It was your bite!
[11:53.620 --> 11:54.620]  Go get him!
[11:55.200 --> 11:55.760]  Goddammit!
[12:00.220 --> 12:00.920]  Oh, shit!
[12:01.620 --> 12:02.460]  That's a dead end.
[12:02.660 --> 12:04.380]  Oh, it's gone! It's gone!
[12:04.520 --> 12:05.820]  Oh, no, it respawned!
[12:06.360 --> 12:07.660]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[12:07.840 --> 12:09.420]  Oh, it respawned? Oh, no!
[12:12.180 --> 12:12.920]  Nice do it.
[12:14.860 --> 12:15.980]  Gotta get there first.
[12:19.840 --> 12:20.240]  Shit!
[12:20.940 --> 12:21.580]  Yeah, goodbye!
[12:27.340 --> 12:28.340]  It's gonna get it.
[12:29.860 --> 12:30.500]  Ow!
[12:36.180 --> 12:37.560]  Goddammit, where'd you come from?
[12:39.420 --> 12:39.580]  No!
[12:41.140 --> 12:42.000]  Get him!
[12:42.600 --> 12:44.240]  Kill the rat!
[12:45.060 --> 12:45.680]  Ow!
[12:49.120 --> 12:49.400]  No!
[12:51.660 --> 12:52.860]  That's so high!
[12:54.560 --> 12:55.760]  Get it, Geoff!
[12:56.760 --> 12:57.480]  Where did it go?
[12:57.920 --> 12:59.200]  It was down right here.
[13:00.560 --> 13:01.440]  No, bullshit!
[13:01.480 --> 13:02.680]  I hit the fucking edge!
[13:08.560 --> 13:09.980]  Come back here!
[13:14.340 --> 13:15.900]  Oh, ow, ow, ow!
[13:18.460 --> 13:20.120]  I didn't like that you came back.
[13:20.460 --> 13:21.600]  I take back what I said.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.940]  Oh, my God! I died fast!
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.060]  Yeah, I beat the fuck out of you.
[13:26.620 --> 13:26.920]  Ow!
[13:30.920 --> 13:33.060]  Dude, I think I like Scoot Scoot.
[13:33.200 --> 13:34.520]  Eric's so close to winning.
[13:35.240 --> 13:36.240]  Oh, no!
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.560]  Oh, God, I ragdolled!
[13:38.800 --> 13:39.440]  Get him!
[13:43.170 --> 13:43.870]  Oh, shit.
[13:44.730 --> 13:45.290]  Tuck and roll!
[13:45.570 --> 13:49.690]  Oh, I'm dead.
[13:51.210 --> 13:52.370]  I'm just dead.
[13:52.570 --> 13:53.950]  I can't let you get it!
[13:53.950 --> 13:54.730]  Damn it!
[13:57.050 --> 13:58.050]  Oh, I was so far...
[13:58.050 --> 13:58.910]  Not so far away.
[14:00.010 --> 14:00.970]  Andrew has it.
[14:02.010 --> 14:02.570]  Scoot!
[14:03.110 --> 14:03.670]  Scoot!
[14:05.550 --> 14:06.790]  Oh, thanks, Nick!
[14:08.450 --> 14:09.730]  No, thanks, Nick!
[14:10.010 --> 14:10.630]  God damn it!
[14:13.370 --> 14:14.650]  Ah, you mother effer!
[14:17.090 --> 14:18.270]  To the sea!
[14:19.390 --> 14:20.650]  Oh, he's gonna bit it!
[14:22.530 --> 14:23.510]  God damn it!
[14:23.510 --> 14:25.050]  I just want to sit on the scooter!
[14:26.570 --> 14:27.490]  Not today!
[14:29.810 --> 14:30.290]  Boom!
[14:34.190 --> 14:36.030]  He launched it into him!
[14:38.210 --> 14:38.410]  Oh, no.
[14:39.110 --> 14:39.690]  Got it!
[14:41.330 --> 14:41.810]  Shit.
[14:44.010 --> 14:45.850]  Did you launch that, Andrew?
[14:45.850 --> 14:46.910]  Did you jump off that, Eric?
[14:47.210 --> 14:49.410]  Yeah. That's what I did before, too.
[14:50.390 --> 14:51.870]  Oh, I had it!
[14:51.890 --> 14:52.990]  Joey had it!
[14:53.230 --> 14:55.190]  You guys were so fucked, I had it!
[14:55.610 --> 14:55.850]  No!
[14:57.230 --> 15:00.330]  Oh, it's all me now, baby!
[15:01.470 --> 15:01.950]  Ow!
[15:06.730 --> 15:08.050]  I went to the fucking ocean!
[15:08.750 --> 15:09.550]  I killed him!
[15:09.650 --> 15:10.770]  God, blow the fuck up!
[15:13.970 --> 15:16.030]  I jumped that thing to the ocean!
[15:16.630 --> 15:18.810]  Did you see it explode as you hit it?
[15:19.950 --> 15:21.350]  I'm like the rock!
[15:22.830 --> 15:22.890]  No!
[15:25.630 --> 15:26.970]  He's gonna get it!
[15:27.930 --> 15:28.550]  Which one?
[15:29.010 --> 15:30.150]  Eric, he's getting away!
[15:31.170 --> 15:31.990]  Go, rat!
[15:38.850 --> 15:40.930]  This rat son of a bitch!
[15:41.650 --> 15:42.070]  No!
[15:42.470 --> 15:43.950]  I'm so close!
[15:45.350 --> 15:45.930]  Kill him!
[15:46.670 --> 15:48.090]  Oh, my teeth!
[15:52.610 --> 15:53.510]  No, don't let it go!
[15:55.840 --> 15:57.040]  It's not even...
[15:57.040 --> 15:57.580]  No!
[16:00.080 --> 16:01.240]  Stop, Andrew, stop!
[16:02.360 --> 16:02.940]  Oh, the rat!
[16:03.060 --> 16:03.720]  The rat's back!
[16:03.880 --> 16:05.120]  Kill Eric, Andrew!
[16:08.080 --> 16:08.700]  I'm trying!
[16:09.160 --> 16:09.880]  Get him off it!
[16:10.520 --> 16:11.400]  I got him!
[16:12.560 --> 16:12.900]  Yes!
[16:15.200 --> 16:15.680]  Shit!
[16:18.240 --> 16:19.060]  Get away!
[16:20.480 --> 16:21.500]  Oh, I fell!
[16:21.880 --> 16:22.800]  Oh, I got killed!
[16:22.800 --> 16:23.620]  Oh, my balls!
[16:25.860 --> 16:26.020]  No!
[16:28.060 --> 16:28.840]  Get away!
[16:29.620 --> 16:30.640]  Come on, Geoff, we gotta go get him.
[16:31.000 --> 16:32.000]  How's he still on this?
[16:33.580 --> 16:33.900]  Get away!
[16:33.900 --> 16:36.200]  Oh, you bitch! You're lucky I'm stupid!
[16:38.440 --> 16:39.700]  Oh, I just punched him!
[16:39.720 --> 16:44.620]  Oh, I'm still here!
[16:45.780 --> 16:46.200]  How?
[16:47.400 --> 16:48.120]  Kill him!
[16:49.380 --> 16:50.140]  Sneak, sneak!
[16:50.140 --> 16:51.840]  Come here!
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.020]  Oh, damn it!
[16:55.280 --> 16:56.540]  Eric threw me off!
[16:57.880 --> 17:00.920]  Go, Eric! Go, rat!
[17:02.870 --> 17:03.070]  No!
[17:06.710 --> 17:07.590]  Holy shit!
[17:10.930 --> 17:11.810]  Rat champion!
[17:14.530 --> 17:16.350]  That was a lot of time that rat got.
[17:16.510 --> 17:18.310]  I think that was a lot of illegal time acquired.
[17:18.470 --> 17:19.870]  We need a fucking rematch on this one.
[17:20.710 --> 17:22.650]  Don't worry, that was one of four.
[17:23.190 --> 17:24.570]  Oh, my God!
[17:24.890 --> 17:26.110]  Oh, my God!
[17:26.690 --> 17:30.450]  I don't know that I have the stamina necessary for four of these.
[17:31.670 --> 17:32.590]  Well, we could do two.
[17:33.470 --> 17:34.550]  Or we could do four!
[17:36.690 --> 17:39.710]  Dude, this game type is crazy.
[17:40.230 --> 17:41.150]  Yeah, this is a good one.
[17:41.250 --> 17:41.910]  Good job, Matt.
[17:42.910 --> 17:43.630]  Good job.
[17:45.190 --> 17:45.910]  The Brogmeister.
[17:46.510 --> 17:48.590]  Oh, man, that was incredible.
[17:49.970 --> 17:51.970]  It's so crazy.
[17:52.090 --> 17:53.270]  What is teams?
[17:56.490 --> 18:03.650]  Oh, look at that.
[18:03.850 --> 18:05.070]  Andrew switched teams.
[18:05.570 --> 18:07.590]  I'm just going to observe.
[18:10.610 --> 18:11.370]  Yeah!
[18:11.990 --> 18:12.570]  Cool guy move.
[18:13.350 --> 18:16.090]  Can you switch to the next game in the playlist, Geoff?
[18:16.570 --> 18:16.830]  No.
[18:18.530 --> 18:19.430]  I think the only way to do it
[18:19.430 --> 18:21.150]  is to tear the playlist down and start over again.
[18:21.870 --> 18:23.230]  So it sounds like we're doing a team game.
[18:23.330 --> 18:23.670]  That's fine.
[18:26.190 --> 18:27.230]  By me, we got it.
[18:27.850 --> 18:28.670]  It's dramatically changed.
[18:31.210 --> 18:31.950]  Drive, Eric, drive!
[18:39.480 --> 18:40.080]  There, Geoff!
[18:40.180 --> 18:40.640]  Dammit, Nick!
[18:41.300 --> 18:43.500]  He's about to take his little rat brains out.
[18:44.960 --> 18:46.140]  Go, rat man, I got you.
[18:47.440 --> 18:48.440]  All right, rat brains.
[18:48.480 --> 18:49.920]  Team rat brains going down the road.
[18:50.640 --> 18:51.460]  They're splitting.
[18:52.060 --> 18:52.760]  Oh, that's you.
[18:53.080 --> 18:55.200]  Sorry, I saw the guy coming up around the side.
[18:55.400 --> 18:58.460]  Oh, shit, you're left!
[18:58.800 --> 19:00.480]  I got it.
[19:03.660 --> 19:04.540]  Oh, no!
[19:11.160 --> 19:12.040]  Neutral observer!
[19:14.680 --> 19:15.560]  Neutral observer!
[19:19.990 --> 19:20.850]  Neutral observer!
[19:22.170 --> 19:23.670]  I can't get anyone near him.
[19:23.710 --> 19:24.590]  Geoff, get off the roof!
[19:31.310 --> 19:32.590]  Neutral observer!
[19:33.110 --> 19:34.210]  Neutral observer!
[19:35.890 --> 19:36.210]  Ah!
[19:36.810 --> 19:37.590]  Oh, my God!
[19:39.090 --> 19:40.410]  Everything's on fire!
[19:40.850 --> 19:42.310]  Nick's body's on my car!
[19:42.810 --> 19:43.830]  Nick, it's gonna respawn.
[19:44.970 --> 19:47.090]  Rat's on fire! Nick, get it!
[19:49.370 --> 19:49.970]  I'm here, baby.
[19:51.670 --> 19:53.370]  Oh, my God, I'm so far away.
[19:53.710 --> 19:54.630]  Oh, no!
[19:54.630 --> 19:56.630]  The neutral observer's down!
[19:57.030 --> 19:57.990]  The neutral observer's down!
[19:59.970 --> 20:01.050]  Keep going, Nick, go!
[20:01.830 --> 20:02.850]  Go, Nick, go!
[20:05.290 --> 20:06.210]  Nick, wrong way!
[20:07.030 --> 20:07.970]  Oh, my God, you're right.
[20:08.090 --> 20:08.810]  I need a vehicle.
[20:10.090 --> 20:11.590]  Oh, there we go.
[20:12.290 --> 20:13.130]  Here they come!
[20:14.130 --> 20:16.550]  My asshole's so far inside me right now.
[20:18.210 --> 20:19.030]  Here they come!
[20:19.110 --> 20:20.750]  My asshole's the opposite of a prolapse.
[20:22.210 --> 20:23.030]  No, get out of here!
[20:24.030 --> 20:24.350]  Yeah.
[20:25.710 --> 20:27.430]  I like having a prelapsed ass.
[20:29.670 --> 20:31.430]  I can't even find... there you go.
[20:32.210 --> 20:33.090]  Ah, you son of a bitch!
[20:34.410 --> 20:35.730]  I heard him, I heard him real bad.
[20:35.810 --> 20:36.590]  Fuck him up, fuck him up!
[20:38.310 --> 20:39.010]  Kill the rat!
[20:39.390 --> 20:41.150]  No need, baby! Go, rat, go!
[20:42.370 --> 20:43.070]  Fuck off, Gavin!
[20:45.090 --> 20:46.290]  How have I stuck?
[20:47.030 --> 20:48.670]  All right, all right, all right, I got him, I got him, he's dead.
[20:48.950 --> 20:49.450]  God damn it.
[20:49.450 --> 20:50.630]  All right, hop on that thing.
[20:51.310 --> 20:53.850]  Sorry, I'm only here to document.
[20:56.030 --> 20:59.170]  Oh, Nick got me, Nick got me, Nick got me, Nick got me, Nick got me.
[21:05.730 --> 21:08.990]  This is good, this is good, doing good, doing good.
[21:09.010 --> 21:10.530]  This is good, doing good.
[21:10.550 --> 21:12.630]  Team Prelapse is racking up the points.
[21:12.630 --> 21:14.110]  Wait, how did he just go through the fence?
[21:14.170 --> 21:15.070]  Oh, my God.
[21:15.630 --> 21:16.570]  I went through the hole in the fence.
[21:16.570 --> 21:19.210]  There was no hole, I just watched you go through a fence.
[21:22.070 --> 21:23.970]  Oh, the back of my face.
[21:24.070 --> 21:25.690]  Oh, the server team didn't work for me.
[21:26.150 --> 21:26.610]  I'm dead.
[21:28.290 --> 21:28.630]  Neutral.
[21:29.330 --> 21:30.430]  Just keeping it neutral.
[21:32.110 --> 21:33.790]  Keeping it nice and neutral.
[21:34.550 --> 21:35.350]  Andrew's neutralizing it.
[21:35.390 --> 21:36.310]  You got it, you got it, you got it, go, go, go.
[21:36.450 --> 21:39.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Gavin, nice job.
[21:40.190 --> 21:40.990]  He stopped me.
[21:41.290 --> 21:41.670]  Oh, Geoff's coming.
[21:42.870 --> 21:43.730]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[21:44.450 --> 21:46.310]  I'm just filming what's happening.
[21:46.830 --> 21:48.290]  Oh, my God.
[21:52.650 --> 21:54.810]  Oh, there's a fight going.
[21:56.150 --> 21:56.990]  Die, Nick.
[21:57.090 --> 21:58.390]  No, that's bullshit, I hit you.
[21:58.390 --> 22:01.610]  You tried to hit me, but you got noodle arms.
[22:03.470 --> 22:04.150]  Noodle arm Nick,
[22:04.250 --> 22:05.530]  chasing him down the street.
[22:06.570 --> 22:08.530]  Serpentine, serpentine, serpentine, serpentine.
[22:08.570 --> 22:10.270]  You'll never catch me now.
[22:10.630 --> 22:12.830]  Serpentine, serpentine, serpentine.
[22:13.510 --> 22:15.850]  Wait, are you on the bike?
[22:16.870 --> 22:18.270]  Where's he gonna go?
[22:18.350 --> 22:19.030]  What's going on?
[22:19.790 --> 22:21.230]  He's on it, he's on it.
[22:21.350 --> 22:22.790]  I'm on it.
[22:23.410 --> 22:24.230]  You're on a different one.
[22:24.570 --> 22:25.770]  You're on the wrong one.
[22:27.130 --> 22:29.950]  It has the thing over it.
[22:30.790 --> 22:32.070]  You're the fake Fudge.
[22:32.230 --> 22:33.630]  No, I just, I have it.
[22:34.030 --> 22:36.230]  Andrew, you absurd piece of shit.
[22:36.390 --> 22:38.010]  The game is fucked up, did you see that?
[22:38.110 --> 22:39.450]  I did not get off my thing.
[22:40.650 --> 22:42.170]  So if I get on this, is this the one?
[22:42.170 --> 22:43.290]  I think so.
[22:43.750 --> 22:44.690]  Mine's earning.
[22:46.050 --> 22:47.110]  I don't understand.
[22:48.530 --> 22:50.170]  They're scoring twice somehow.
[22:51.170 --> 22:52.830]  Eric's got a counterfeit Fudge.
[22:52.830 --> 22:54.270]  I did and it worked.
[22:56.490 --> 22:57.470]  That's bullshit.
[22:58.890 --> 23:00.710]  Now I'm just on a slow Fudge
[23:00.710 --> 23:02.150]  trying to catch the real one.
[23:03.830 --> 23:04.990]  Knock him Geoff.
[23:05.750 --> 23:07.430]  Oh, into the dish.
[23:08.530 --> 23:09.110]  We dished him.
[23:10.410 --> 23:11.990]  Dishing out punishment.
[23:13.390 --> 23:14.850]  Go Nick, go.
[23:14.990 --> 23:17.430]  Oh God in heaven.
[23:18.390 --> 23:22.890]  I just heard Geoff's...
[23:23.310 --> 23:24.590]  Whatever his name is, Gavin.
[23:28.090 --> 23:29.990]  Relapse with the beatdown.
[23:31.250 --> 23:33.150]  I don't know.
[23:33.870 --> 23:35.230]  I don't know.
[23:35.870 --> 23:37.010]  Which one's the real one?
[23:37.010 --> 23:37.510]  It's this one.
[23:38.270 --> 23:40.350]  I got the light on me.
[23:41.770 --> 23:43.730]  They both have the light on them.
[23:43.730 --> 23:44.350]  Double points.
[23:49.110 --> 23:50.630]  I don't know who to follow.
[23:51.150 --> 23:52.110]  God dammit Nick.
[23:55.250 --> 23:56.870]  Yours is the real one it looks like.
[23:57.370 --> 23:57.770]  Counterfeit.
[23:59.470 --> 23:59.870]  Counterfeit.
[24:00.910 --> 24:02.310]  It's gotta be the other one then, right?
[24:02.430 --> 24:03.050]  The one at the beach?
[24:03.050 --> 24:06.330]  Oh, Nick pinned him.
[24:06.990 --> 24:08.210]  That was nasty.
[24:08.730 --> 24:10.490]  Geoff did the same to Nick.
[24:11.910 --> 24:13.650]  My comeuppance was swift.
[24:14.770 --> 24:15.890]  Geoff, that's the real one.
[24:16.770 --> 24:17.210]  Alright.
[24:17.630 --> 24:20.390]  Well, I'm really loving it.
[24:24.210 --> 24:25.810]  Wait, it says it's contested?
[24:25.890 --> 24:27.090]  It says Eric's on the real one.
[24:29.730 --> 24:32.030]  That was a confusing mess.
[24:32.550 --> 24:33.550]  Dammit Matt Bragg!
[24:43.450 --> 24:46.010]  I'm gonna switch this shit to free for all.
[24:46.210 --> 24:49.890]  Feel free.
[24:52.810 --> 24:56.170]  I gotta say, the hero of that round was the neutral observer.
[24:56.590 --> 24:58.150]  I really like this neutral observer.
[24:59.670 --> 25:02.710]  I went to the PO box today and returned a bunch of mail.
[25:02.970 --> 25:03.710]  That didn't belong to us.
[25:05.290 --> 25:06.010]  Thanks, man.
[25:08.190 --> 25:09.670]  We got some sort of a wedding invite.
[25:09.950 --> 25:10.690]  I didn't open it yet.
[25:12.450 --> 25:14.250]  I'm sick of weddings.
[25:14.470 --> 25:15.230]  I will not be attending.
[25:17.390 --> 25:18.770]  To be fair, it could be a graduation.
[25:18.910 --> 25:19.950]  It just seems like an announcement.
[25:21.350 --> 25:22.430]  But I haven't opened it yet.
[25:23.190 --> 25:24.390]  Why am I driving away?
[25:24.590 --> 25:25.330]  I don't know.
[25:25.410 --> 25:28.150]  You started driving towards me and I don't get it.
[25:28.230 --> 25:29.690]  I'm still on the loading screen.
[25:32.410 --> 25:34.010]  Oh my god, Nick.
[25:34.970 --> 25:36.410]  Oh my god, Nick!
[25:37.190 --> 25:38.330]  It had to be done.
[25:39.670 --> 25:40.630]  Yeah, did you get it?
[25:41.690 --> 25:41.890]  Nope.
[25:42.050 --> 25:43.650]  That was so bad.
[25:44.010 --> 25:45.990]  That was a couple whips from Andrew Panton.
[25:46.650 --> 25:48.030]  Oh, just the biggest.
[25:50.150 --> 25:50.670]  Yup!
[25:51.310 --> 25:51.510]  Oh!
[25:51.990 --> 25:53.190]  I got a face full of wool.
[25:55.290 --> 25:56.590]  Oh my god!
[25:56.710 --> 25:58.230]  Nick is just like...
[25:58.230 --> 25:59.690]  You must die!
[26:01.030 --> 26:01.550]  Disgusting.
[26:01.890 --> 26:03.890]  Where did he get a hatchet from?
[26:04.330 --> 26:05.590]  He's hitting me with an axe.
[26:05.790 --> 26:08.070]  Yeah, this one's battle axe.
[26:08.430 --> 26:08.890]  For the weapon.
[26:11.190 --> 26:11.470]  Oh!
[26:12.310 --> 26:14.190]  Eric, that would have been so cool.
[26:14.570 --> 26:15.530]  I tried to be the bird.
[26:18.590 --> 26:19.010]  Oh!
[26:19.610 --> 26:21.870]  My penis! You just axed my penis!
[26:22.670 --> 26:23.870]  Oh, my thumbstick flew off.
[26:24.250 --> 26:24.470]  Good.
[26:25.710 --> 26:27.530]  I thought your name was Alfie Boston!
[26:27.590 --> 26:28.590]  Now your head flew off!
[26:32.650 --> 26:34.050]  Oh, where's that little son of a gun?
[26:35.150 --> 26:35.930]  Rat time, baby!
[26:36.390 --> 26:36.910]  Rat time!
[26:38.310 --> 26:39.730]  I'm sick of rat time.
[26:39.750 --> 26:40.010]  Wrong way!
[26:41.450 --> 26:41.790]  No!
[26:43.270 --> 26:44.770]  I barely caught you.
[26:44.970 --> 26:46.390]  I didn't even know if I was gonna hit you on that one.
[26:47.570 --> 26:48.630]  We gotta get out of here.
[26:49.310 --> 26:50.510]  This is too much.
[26:51.410 --> 26:51.750]  No!
[26:53.430 --> 26:54.310]  It's so...
[26:54.310 --> 26:56.810]  It's so good when you can't see
[26:56.810 --> 26:58.450]  what's happening and then you just
[26:58.450 --> 27:00.170]  hear a bunch of screams.
[27:00.590 --> 27:01.670]  Whoa, a dog! Cool!
[27:01.750 --> 27:03.370]  I'm wasting all this time!
[27:04.450 --> 27:05.810]  Geoff, did you load in?
[27:06.230 --> 27:07.550]  Nah, I'm just listening to y'all.
[27:09.230 --> 27:09.910]  Thanks, man.
[27:10.370 --> 27:10.770]  Oh!
[27:14.990 --> 27:16.310]  Geoff and Hatchets!
[27:17.350 --> 27:17.810]  There you go.
[27:18.530 --> 27:20.110]  There you go, Geoff.
[27:20.210 --> 27:21.330]  You can watch my screen if you want.
[27:22.090 --> 27:22.890]  Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.
[27:23.130 --> 27:26.150]  I was looking at a dog, so I wasn't chasing anyone.
[27:28.750 --> 27:29.550]  I miss Gavin!
[27:30.230 --> 27:31.050]  So Geoff's not in?
[27:31.590 --> 27:32.470]  No, he's in the sky.
[27:33.110 --> 27:33.390]  Bullet!
[27:34.730 --> 27:35.550]  Should we wait?
[27:37.130 --> 27:38.370]  No, you're halfway through.
[27:38.710 --> 27:40.570]  Yeah, let me get back on the bike
[27:40.570 --> 27:41.250]  and then we can wait.
[27:41.830 --> 27:43.670]  I'm just frozen on a picture of Mr. Herman.
[27:43.930 --> 27:45.670]  I don't know if I should reload my game or what.
[27:48.910 --> 27:49.770]  No! The rat!
[27:50.490 --> 27:50.910]  Rat time!
[27:51.570 --> 27:52.050]  Rat time!
[27:55.090 --> 27:55.850]  Killer rat!
[27:58.510 --> 27:59.110]  Rat time!
[27:59.650 --> 28:01.350]  I'm stuck! Rat time! I'm stuck!
[28:01.410 --> 28:01.730]  I'm stuck!
[28:01.730 --> 28:02.690]  I'm stuck!
[28:04.430 --> 28:07.110]  You little rat bitch.
[28:07.330 --> 28:08.390]  You got a ghost face?
[28:09.030 --> 28:10.670]  Yeah, I got rat time.
[28:10.830 --> 28:11.790]  Ghost face? I saw a scream.
[28:12.110 --> 28:12.390]  No!
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.480]  I got it from every which way.
[28:26.960 --> 28:28.760]  I'm just driving around.
[28:29.400 --> 28:30.120]  Just doing nothing.
[28:31.640 --> 28:33.160]  Please move the vehicle.
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.280]  Oh my god!
[28:35.380 --> 28:36.620]  How did that not hit you?
[28:37.220 --> 28:38.120]  I don't know. Goodbye.
[28:38.940 --> 28:39.800]  Coming after you, Nick.
[28:40.900 --> 28:41.400]  Please don't.
[28:47.560 --> 28:48.800]  Serpentining is good, Nick.
[28:57.900 --> 29:01.160]  The gates are collapsing.
[29:01.880 --> 29:03.420]  I'm stuck in the gate!
[29:04.040 --> 29:04.600]  Oh, the train.
[29:04.900 --> 29:06.260]  You've taken my advantage.
[29:08.380 --> 29:09.820]  Oh, I got hit by a gate.
[29:09.920 --> 29:10.560]  Hit by a train.
[29:10.700 --> 29:11.860]  Oh, I got fucked.
[29:14.620 --> 29:15.800]  Someone else has to catch him.
[29:16.260 --> 29:16.920]  Where is he?
[29:18.300 --> 29:19.540]  He's going up the hill.
[29:20.160 --> 29:21.000]  He's trying to go up there.
[29:21.500 --> 29:23.680]  He's trying to go up the hill.
[29:23.780 --> 29:24.640]  He's coming back down the hill.
[29:24.980 --> 29:26.320]  He's coming back down the hill, baby!
[29:26.920 --> 29:27.640]  Oh no!
[29:27.640 --> 29:29.340]  Oh no!
[29:30.280 --> 29:32.500]  Hey, Eric, I'm spectating in-game, so you can stop.
[29:32.500 --> 29:32.900]  Okay, cool.
[29:35.660 --> 29:37.000]  Damn, rat time's back.
[29:37.180 --> 29:37.860]  Go, rat, go.
[29:38.120 --> 29:39.300]  Go, rat, go.
[29:39.640 --> 29:41.080]  No, rat, no!
[29:41.200 --> 29:44.200]  No, this is bullshit. You're dead as dicks. I'm gonna kill you.
[29:45.040 --> 29:45.640]  Go, rat, go!
[29:46.960 --> 29:48.700]  That fence can't save you forever.
[29:55.240 --> 29:57.260]  Circling like a fucking pack of...
[29:57.260 --> 29:58.840]  You guys are like hyenas.
[29:58.960 --> 30:01.400]  There you go.
[30:03.040 --> 30:04.880]  Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
[30:07.280 --> 30:10.180]  Go, rat!
[30:13.180 --> 30:14.540]  Go, rat, you motherfucker!
[30:18.680 --> 30:27.020]  Oh, Nick!
[30:30.800 --> 30:31.740]  Oh, rat!
[30:32.100 --> 30:35.020]  That was the razziest entrance.
[30:35.660 --> 30:36.340]  Get him!
[30:36.600 --> 30:37.480]  Not me!
[30:38.280 --> 30:39.460]  No, get him!
[30:39.900 --> 30:41.260]  He's the rat guy!
[30:41.940 --> 30:44.040]  The rat guy's gonna win!
[30:44.360 --> 30:45.460]  No, he's not.
[30:46.060 --> 30:47.140]  Go, rat, go!
[30:48.540 --> 30:50.300]  I'm dragging a corpse!
[30:53.540 --> 30:54.640]  What the...
[30:54.640 --> 30:56.120]  Dude, look, you took a chunk out of that.
[30:56.120 --> 30:56.940]  Oh, goddammit.
[30:59.360 --> 30:59.740]  No!
[31:04.220 --> 31:04.980]  Oh, goddammit!
[31:06.960 --> 31:09.280]  Don't worry, it goes slow when you go forward, too.
[31:14.700 --> 31:15.660]  I crashed myself.
[31:18.080 --> 31:18.860]  No, the train!
[31:20.820 --> 31:22.060]  Shit, I suck.
[31:22.240 --> 31:23.540]  Goddammit, the train, come on!
[31:23.800 --> 31:25.520]  You guys are gonna kill each other.
[31:25.520 --> 31:28.000]  It wasn't time for the rat to show up and take it.
[31:28.580 --> 31:29.500]  Where'd it go?
[31:29.800 --> 31:30.960]  It respawned!
[31:34.460 --> 31:36.760]  Wasted all my time going away, that wasn't even right.
[31:36.880 --> 31:37.420]  Now I gotta go back.
[31:38.280 --> 31:39.980]  I could've just waited on killing Gavin!
[31:40.500 --> 31:42.020]  Yeah, you gave him the fucking badgie.
[31:44.980 --> 31:45.420]  Bully!
[31:45.680 --> 31:46.300]  I gave him nothing!
[31:48.180 --> 31:49.060]  What happened?
[31:49.840 --> 31:51.080]  You went through a fence.
[31:55.980 --> 31:59.960]  Andrew driving out of the fence was fucking very funny.
[32:01.760 --> 32:02.680]  He's around the back!
[32:02.840 --> 32:03.320]  Get him!
[32:03.880 --> 32:04.360]  Go!
[32:06.700 --> 32:08.500]  You fucking moron!
[32:08.920 --> 32:09.440]  You idiot!
[32:09.860 --> 32:14.180]  You fucking bunched up my chef dipshits!
[32:14.660 --> 32:16.800]  That is so fucking funny.
[32:17.980 --> 32:19.100]  This game's fake!
[32:19.960 --> 32:21.380]  I thought it was real!
[32:22.560 --> 32:23.180]  Oh!
[32:25.860 --> 32:27.040]  Wait, where's Eric?
[32:29.140 --> 32:31.260]  Why are you all hitting me?
[32:32.660 --> 32:33.900]  100% bullshit!
[32:35.980 --> 32:36.300]  Damn it!
[32:37.560 --> 32:38.260]  No!
[32:38.600 --> 32:39.420]  Wrong vehicle, Nick!
[32:40.780 --> 32:42.480]  You've wasted your opportunity.
[32:42.680 --> 32:44.580]  Gavin's gonna fucking eat your lunch now.
[32:45.560 --> 32:46.520]  I'm hungry.
[32:46.900 --> 32:48.020]  Hungry for the luncheon!
[32:49.900 --> 32:51.260]  Oh shit!
[32:52.440 --> 32:53.320]  Left hook!
[32:53.320 --> 32:54.800]  Left hook!
[32:55.620 --> 32:57.560]  As soon as I got there, dude!
[32:57.800 --> 32:57.900]  Jesus!
[33:00.360 --> 33:02.620]  Nobody's getting on this thing anytime soon.
[33:03.000 --> 33:05.600]  I think it's respawning.
[33:06.800 --> 33:07.740]  I hope it is!
[33:08.760 --> 33:09.960]  Let me escape!
[33:10.060 --> 33:11.900]  Let me escape with it!
[33:14.160 --> 33:15.360]  Kill Andrew!
[33:16.200 --> 33:17.280]  Where is he?
[33:17.820 --> 33:19.480]  Oh, Gavin Clutch!
[33:19.640 --> 33:22.060]  Get away from my bike!
[33:22.060 --> 33:23.720]  I tripped on my bike!
[33:23.760 --> 33:25.120]  There's too much shit in it!
[33:29.760 --> 33:31.900]  Nick just took your chin off!
[33:32.040 --> 33:33.060]  I've got de-chinned!
[33:33.680 --> 33:36.180]  You got tomahawked in the fucking grill!
[33:36.340 --> 33:37.700]  He pre-lapsed my chin!
[33:38.260 --> 33:38.920]  Oh, he did!
[33:40.820 --> 33:43.800]  And then you bonked your head on the side of the fucking street sign!
[33:43.820 --> 33:44.620]  Stop watching me!
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.060]  Spectate someone else!
[33:46.480 --> 33:47.420]  No way, dude!
[33:47.420 --> 33:48.640]  There's too much going on with you!
[33:48.640 --> 33:51.960]  Come here, bitch ass!
[33:51.960 --> 33:53.080]  Oh, that was so unnecessary!
[33:55.160 --> 33:55.920]  Oh, he stunned me there.
[33:55.940 --> 33:56.540]  How did he win it again?
[33:57.020 --> 33:58.260]  Keep your head off of metal!
[34:00.660 --> 34:01.540]  Eat shit!
[34:02.160 --> 34:02.880]  Eat shit, ass!
[34:05.540 --> 34:06.660]  God damn it!
[34:06.740 --> 34:08.380]  Get the fuck on there!
[34:08.740 --> 34:09.900]  There he goes!
[34:10.720 --> 34:12.460]  Zoom, zoom! Oh, you idiot!
[34:12.860 --> 34:13.940]  No, you're still fine!
[34:15.900 --> 34:17.180]  Andrew saved your life!
[34:17.180 --> 34:20.720]  How are you not dead?
[34:21.320 --> 34:22.540]  Because you killed me!
[34:23.080 --> 34:24.220]  No, but I hit him again.
[34:24.500 --> 34:25.100]  After that.
[34:25.880 --> 34:27.840]  How are you hitting me, but I'm not hitting you?
[34:29.340 --> 34:29.860]  No!
[34:30.440 --> 34:30.960]  No!
[34:32.480 --> 34:33.240]  God damn it!
[34:35.260 --> 34:39.540]  It's so funny when I watch the dick scream as I trail away at one mile an hour.
[34:39.840 --> 34:40.120]  Whoa!
[34:41.740 --> 34:43.260]  That was pretty smooth, Gav.
[34:44.380 --> 34:45.460]  You mother fucker!
[34:46.100 --> 34:46.540]  Wow!
[34:49.900 --> 34:50.780]  Oh, respawn.
[34:54.060 --> 34:55.940]  Eric just sent Gavin right to it.
[34:56.100 --> 34:57.600]  Yeah, go to hell.
[34:57.760 --> 34:59.380]  I gotta stop him from helping Andrew.
[35:00.200 --> 35:01.140]  Oh shit, no!
[35:06.350 --> 35:07.130]  Go, go, go!
[35:07.890 --> 35:08.550]  Fucking move!
[35:13.930 --> 35:15.050]  Every time, Eric.
[35:15.300 --> 35:16.170]  It's so funny.
[35:16.210 --> 35:17.390]  I'm a bullet, baby!
[35:19.190 --> 35:19.850]  Escape!
[35:22.230 --> 35:23.530]  Oh, he's chasing me!
[35:25.650 --> 35:26.990]  It wouldn't let me get in the car.
[35:29.370 --> 35:30.770]  Oh, you're not an impartial observer.
[35:31.030 --> 35:32.170]  Oh shit!
[35:33.350 --> 35:33.850]  Idiot.
[35:38.810 --> 35:40.630]  Oh my god!
[35:42.350 --> 35:43.350]  I'm hungry!
[35:46.390 --> 35:47.750]  Get chewed!
[35:49.870 --> 35:50.790]  Who's next?
[35:52.050 --> 35:53.510]  Oh, it's right there.
[36:05.960 --> 36:08.260]  She's there to pick up the pieces, man.
[36:09.500 --> 36:11.400]  Gavin, that was really good.
[36:12.100 --> 36:14.980]  I can't believe that worked as well as it did.
[36:16.880 --> 36:17.940]  You idiot.
[36:18.500 --> 36:20.940]  This is a safety cage.
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.820]  Fuck your safety cage!
[36:29.300 --> 36:29.980]  No, not Eric!
[36:31.180 --> 36:34.540]  You hit everybody but Eric, you fucking moron!
[36:37.500 --> 36:41.980]  Alright, let's go.
[36:41.980 --> 36:45.940]  Do you take the fucking trailer with you?
[36:48.060 --> 36:50.140]  You fucking moron!
[36:51.120 --> 36:51.960]  Oh, Jesus!
[36:53.060 --> 36:53.860]  Suck it, Nick!
[36:58.280 --> 36:59.500]  Nick, carpool, carpool!
[36:59.900 --> 37:00.960]  Alright, quick, get in, get in!
[37:02.260 --> 37:04.660]  Why would you shit on the guy who's about to win?
[37:04.840 --> 37:06.520]  We can't carpool, damn it.
[37:07.740 --> 37:08.300]  Ow!
[37:08.580 --> 37:08.880]  Ow!
[37:09.260 --> 37:11.440]  What the god damn was that?
[37:11.840 --> 37:12.160]  I got fucked.
[37:16.640 --> 37:17.240]  Respawned.
[37:17.240 --> 37:18.700]  Shit, I get a vehicle, Gavin.
[37:18.900 --> 37:19.320]  I know.
[37:22.600 --> 37:23.640]  Come here, someone!
[37:29.780 --> 37:31.100]  I'm walking into you.
[37:32.900 --> 37:34.500]  I'm walking into you.
[37:36.380 --> 37:36.860]  Who?
[37:37.560 --> 37:39.640]  Gavin, I'm getting him in my sights.
[37:39.940 --> 37:41.280]  Gavin got that good AIDS.
[37:42.300 --> 37:43.860]  Revenge kill, baby!
[37:44.700 --> 37:45.620]  You guys remember AIDS?
[37:46.780 --> 37:48.000]  How could I forget?
[37:48.460 --> 37:49.780]  Arsenio Hall, the whole gang?
[37:51.160 --> 37:52.700]  You talking about vaginal fluids?
[37:55.940 --> 37:57.780]  Yeah, yeah!
[37:58.200 --> 38:00.120]  After he hit me. Get real.
[38:01.920 --> 38:02.580]  Oh god.
[38:03.900 --> 38:05.460]  How is none of that hitting you?
[38:06.040 --> 38:07.000]  Oh my god!
[38:08.720 --> 38:09.460]  Gavin!
[38:13.100 --> 38:14.580]  Andrew sucks.
[38:20.480 --> 38:21.220]  Die!
[38:22.840 --> 38:24.440]  How is he not dead?
[38:24.760 --> 38:25.100]  Die!
[38:26.280 --> 38:27.620]  Dude, you gotta use my footage.
[38:28.360 --> 38:29.100]  Bullet!
[38:29.940 --> 38:31.020]  No, it didn't go!
[38:32.180 --> 38:33.920]  Eric just rolled up.
[38:35.060 --> 38:36.580]  Don't run me over!
[38:38.780 --> 38:40.800]  I've got some great cams.
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.040]  You lucky bitch!
[38:42.400 --> 38:43.480]  You luckiest bitch!
[38:45.580 --> 38:47.520]  Damn these tiny wolves!
[38:47.720 --> 38:49.520]  You fucking suck, dude.
[38:53.140 --> 38:55.900]  Damn these tiny wolves.
[38:57.860 --> 38:59.160]  Die, you little motherfucker!
[38:59.520 --> 39:00.060]  That's right!
[39:03.240 --> 39:04.540]  Oh god!
[39:05.100 --> 39:06.360]  No!
[39:10.560 --> 39:10.800]  No!
[39:12.940 --> 39:14.400]  Is everyone gone?
[39:14.920 --> 39:15.140]  Excellent.
[39:15.780 --> 39:17.300]  And it's blocked.
[39:22.070 --> 39:23.870]  That was incredible!
[39:24.790 --> 39:26.590]  That was so good, man.
[39:26.850 --> 39:27.850]  Inspired, Gavin.
[39:28.350 --> 39:29.490]  That was so wonderful.
[39:30.210 --> 39:30.890]  Get through here.
[39:31.550 --> 39:35.470]  You fucking wheelied yourself off.
[39:37.270 --> 39:38.630]  Oh god!
[39:39.450 --> 39:40.410]  No, Eric!
[39:41.270 --> 39:42.830]  No, don't kill me!
[39:52.700 --> 39:54.720]  The rat's headed for the sea!
[39:57.100 --> 39:58.860]  Stop it before the plague spreads!
[40:06.640 --> 40:08.700]  Pied Piper, that little fucker!
[40:09.560 --> 40:11.460]  I'm leading them to the sea, Geoff!
[40:11.840 --> 40:12.280]  No!
[40:19.980 --> 40:22.280]  I thought he was going to go real fast in the sand.
[40:22.660 --> 40:26.420]  Oh Gavin.
[40:28.680 --> 40:33.240]  Alright, I'm going to work the wheelies
[40:33.750 --> 40:35.840]  to my advantage without overdoing it.
[40:36.420 --> 40:37.760]  See, you better get in that tunnel
[40:37.760 --> 40:39.200]  or they can't follow you.
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.240]  They can definitely follow you.
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.600]  Damn this rat!
[40:50.100 --> 40:55.300]  Andrew, you...
[40:55.300 --> 40:56.160]  Whoops.
[41:01.340 --> 41:02.380]  You...
[41:02.380 --> 41:02.880]  Rat!
[41:04.580 --> 41:05.080]  No!
[41:06.300 --> 41:07.060]  He's...
[41:07.640 --> 41:09.620]  He's doing rat-spamma.
[41:09.660 --> 41:13.140]  To the sea!
[41:15.240 --> 41:16.620]  Ah, wet bike.
[41:22.280 --> 41:25.340]  Oh, de-spawned!
[41:25.540 --> 41:25.840]  No!
[41:26.260 --> 41:29.060]  Oh shit, my bike's dead!
[41:29.360 --> 41:30.980]  Oh no! We fucked ourselves!
[41:30.980 --> 41:34.200]  Near the ocean and then de-spawned it.
[41:36.880 --> 41:39.160]  We gotta kill each other!
[41:39.260 --> 41:39.820]  We gotta kill each other!
[41:45.580 --> 41:47.400]  Go save the farm!
[41:51.960 --> 41:56.900]  Gavin, the guy who's winning!
[42:02.580 --> 42:05.360]  Yeah, second thought, not good.
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.040]  Yeah, I had a thought.
[42:09.220 --> 42:10.300]  Get off!
[42:10.760 --> 42:13.480]  Oh, that's a hard ratting right there.
[42:14.760 --> 42:15.920]  It's the disrespect.
[42:23.830 --> 42:24.270]  No!
[42:24.970 --> 42:27.290]  You guys are never gonna catch up!
[42:27.730 --> 42:29.130]  I'm on my way to him!
[42:29.970 --> 42:30.990]  That was brutal.
[42:32.710 --> 42:34.650]  Don't you get cocky with your wheelies!
[42:36.030 --> 42:38.130]  Oh, that's my blood on that sign!
[42:38.530 --> 42:39.130]  Bullet!
[42:39.430 --> 42:39.910]  Oh shit!
[42:41.910 --> 42:42.730]  Get out!
[42:42.870 --> 42:43.390]  Get out!
[42:44.990 --> 42:45.150]  No!
[42:47.330 --> 42:47.450]  No!
[42:47.710 --> 42:47.910]  No!
[42:49.810 --> 42:50.410]  Bullet!
[42:54.460 --> 42:55.380]  Oh shit!
[42:57.760 --> 42:58.680]  Give me this!
[42:58.840 --> 43:00.060]  Give me this goddamn thing!
[43:02.500 --> 43:04.520]  Son of a bitch ass!
[43:12.420 --> 43:13.800]  Oh shit!
[43:15.080 --> 43:16.260]  Oh my god!
[43:16.620 --> 43:18.120]  Was not expecting a car!
[43:18.880 --> 43:19.560]  Fuck!
[43:22.740 --> 43:27.700]  Oh, you bitch!
[43:29.060 --> 43:30.360]  You're not gonna hit me twice.
[43:32.420 --> 43:34.040]  Oh, come on!
[43:36.020 --> 43:37.320]  Oh shit, no!
[43:44.460 --> 43:45.500]  It's respawned!
[43:45.940 --> 43:46.840]  Go, go, go!
[43:48.220 --> 43:49.380]  Gavin's coming, he's coming!
[43:49.800 --> 43:50.360]  He's in the car!
[43:52.700 --> 43:53.560]  He's dead!
[43:58.880 --> 43:59.900]  Don't hit me!
[43:59.900 --> 44:01.180]  Hit him!
[44:06.740 --> 44:08.300]  Oh, come on!
[44:13.140 --> 44:14.880]  Go, go!
[44:20.670 --> 44:22.620]  Eric got through that.
[44:23.240 --> 44:27.460]  Guys, they just fixed this fence again.
[44:32.460 --> 44:34.920]  No, get on the right bike!
[44:35.040 --> 44:35.540]  Oh Christ!
[44:35.660 --> 44:37.820]  What the fuck was Nick doing, hiding in the bushes?
[44:38.780 --> 44:40.020]  He's fucking in the bushes, yeah.
[44:42.180 --> 44:46.600]  Give me this goddamn thing!
[44:48.200 --> 44:48.520]  Oh!
[44:49.560 --> 44:49.960]  That's it!
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.960]  That's it, Gavin won.
[44:52.380 --> 44:54.020]  Not over yet.
[44:54.340 --> 44:56.060]  There's 20 seconds, they're not gonna get it.
[44:56.140 --> 44:57.500]  I'm the closest to second.
[44:58.580 --> 44:59.820]  He might have it.
[45:00.270 --> 45:01.240]  Right, that's what I said.
[45:06.660 --> 45:08.560]  This is a slow ass car.
[45:08.980 --> 45:09.360]  Jesus.
[45:10.500 --> 45:11.540]  Five seconds, Gav.
[45:11.780 --> 45:14.900]  Damn, damn, damn.
[45:15.540 --> 45:16.540]  Wheelie of victory!
[45:17.600 --> 45:18.180]  Congratulations!
[45:19.780 --> 45:25.520]  I blame Nick exclusively for not understanding how this game type works for some reason.
[45:26.180 --> 45:27.440]  Nick had the most kills, least deaths.
[45:28.120 --> 45:29.500]  Oh cool, enjoy fourth.
[45:30.100 --> 45:31.020]  Like, cool.
[45:31.580 --> 45:33.640]  So Geoff, are you back in for the final one?
[45:33.960 --> 45:34.480]  I hope so.
[45:34.640 --> 45:36.060]  He's an observer, he should be.
[45:38.200 --> 45:39.580]  God, this game type is awesome.
[45:39.760 --> 45:40.420]  This is really fun.
[45:41.340 --> 45:42.080]  Oh, a fast bike.
[45:44.240 --> 45:45.160]  That's a pretty bike.
[45:45.160 --> 45:45.860]  Am I on a roof?
[45:46.720 --> 45:48.420]  Oh, it's a bloody jet bike.
[45:48.800 --> 45:50.460]  What does that mean?
[45:51.460 --> 45:53.180]  Right bumper to unfold the wings,
[45:53.400 --> 45:55.660]  and left stick to boost and fly!
[45:56.120 --> 45:57.420]  I lost my bike already.
[45:58.060 --> 45:58.500]  Yeah.
[46:03.360 --> 46:04.200]  Open it up!
[46:04.740 --> 46:07.740]  I'm just, like, in someone's backyard.
[46:08.440 --> 46:09.940]  I can't get my bike.
[46:12.460 --> 46:12.900]  Ow!
[46:14.340 --> 46:15.700]  How do some people already get it?
[46:15.880 --> 46:17.400]  I spawned so far away.
[46:18.540 --> 46:21.020]  I'm at the observatory, for God's sake.
[46:22.060 --> 46:23.220]  What's the button to fly?
[46:23.340 --> 46:23.840]  Oh, there it is.
[46:24.340 --> 46:25.220]  Holy shit!
[46:27.180 --> 46:28.260]  I'm gonna have to kill myself.
[46:28.760 --> 46:29.480]  How do you kill yourself?
[46:30.140 --> 46:31.460]  I'm just gonna jump off a roof.
[46:31.600 --> 46:33.580]  You can hold down back and just take pills.
[46:36.280 --> 46:40.720]  Oh, so there's no weapons?
[46:41.360 --> 46:42.660]  You can't do it on this.
[46:42.860 --> 46:43.440]  Isn't there a machete?
[46:44.080 --> 46:46.340]  No, I guess it's the machine guns from the bike.
[46:46.740 --> 46:48.740]  No, there's a machete!
[46:49.300 --> 46:51.140]  I don't know how to use it on my jet bike.
[46:51.440 --> 46:51.960]  No, me neither.
[46:52.060 --> 46:55.140]  I think left bumper is machine gun.
[46:55.980 --> 46:56.180]  Oh!
[46:56.180 --> 47:00.040]  Oh my God!
[47:00.360 --> 47:02.020]  This might be over.
[47:02.720 --> 47:04.140]  This is a rough one.
[47:04.280 --> 47:04.880]  This one's tough.
[47:05.380 --> 47:05.800]  Get away!
[47:06.280 --> 47:06.520]  Damn it!
[47:10.750 --> 47:11.770]  Get machete me!
[47:13.730 --> 47:15.130]  I'm in Hollywood a lot!
[47:16.090 --> 47:17.250]  That was cool.
[47:17.970 --> 47:18.790]  That was real cool.
[47:21.430 --> 47:22.090]  Freedom!
[47:23.110 --> 47:23.710]  Whoa!
[47:24.530 --> 47:25.190]  Ow!
[47:29.390 --> 47:29.990]  Ow!
[47:31.410 --> 47:34.390]  Die, you goddamn!
[47:36.610 --> 47:37.610]  Stop that!
[47:39.770 --> 47:40.650]  Stop it!
[47:41.070 --> 47:42.830]  This is so much harder than hitting you with a hammer!
[47:43.710 --> 47:44.790]  If I should fall...
[47:49.320 --> 47:49.920]  No!
[47:57.800 --> 48:00.280]  This is so much worse.
[48:00.580 --> 48:00.920]  This sucks.
[48:03.100 --> 48:03.660]  Ow!
[48:03.800 --> 48:04.280]  My back!
[48:10.160 --> 48:11.340]  Geoff, where are you going?
[48:14.900 --> 48:16.620]  I hit the wrong button!
[48:17.460 --> 48:19.280]  Oh, I just missed him.
[48:25.600 --> 48:27.060]  Oh, there's bullets.
[48:27.480 --> 48:28.260]  Lots of bullets.
[48:29.860 --> 48:31.120]  How are you still alive?
[48:35.130 --> 48:36.750]  Oh, right. That's how I am.
[48:38.370 --> 48:38.850]  Excuse me?
[48:39.790 --> 48:40.230]  Yes!
[48:42.250 --> 48:42.950]  Oh, God!
[48:43.050 --> 48:43.610]  Oh, no!
[48:43.890 --> 48:45.350]  Nick, you're blocking the bike!
[48:48.550 --> 48:48.990]  Nick!
[48:55.060 --> 48:56.560]  Nick doesn't care about the bike.
[48:56.620 --> 48:57.680]  He just wants to flatten me.
[48:58.800 --> 49:00.780]  I just want to keep everyone away from the bike.
[49:01.580 --> 49:02.820]  What the hell?
[49:03.720 --> 49:05.520]  I got hit by a jetpack.
[49:05.540 --> 49:06.540]  That was incredible!
[49:07.560 --> 49:08.440]  How are you doing, Geoff?
[49:08.930 --> 49:09.180]  Good.
[49:10.900 --> 49:11.840]  Do you have it?
[49:13.340 --> 49:13.840]  Who?
[49:14.520 --> 49:15.560]  Okay, so Nick has it.
[49:17.360 --> 49:17.860]  No.
[49:19.360 --> 49:19.980]  I'm on him.
[49:21.560 --> 49:21.860]  Uh-oh.
[49:28.940 --> 49:30.920]  I don't understand how that's your
[49:30.920 --> 49:31.680]  go-to song.
[49:33.180 --> 49:34.300]  What's wrong with you?
[49:36.160 --> 49:37.480]  Well, earlier I was singing
[49:37.480 --> 49:38.480]  Make My Way Downtown.
[49:38.660 --> 49:39.440]  Hello. Goodbye.
[49:40.960 --> 49:41.220]  Uh-oh.
[49:41.580 --> 49:45.220]  Nick said hello and then drove into a light post
[49:45.220 --> 49:46.000]  and said goodbye.
[49:47.200 --> 49:47.840]  Oh!
[49:48.660 --> 49:49.280]  Gavin!
[49:50.000 --> 49:50.600]  You killed me!
[49:51.820 --> 49:52.120]  Whoa!
[49:53.500 --> 49:55.480]  Oh, my God!
[49:58.540 --> 49:59.340]  Oh, no!
[50:00.140 --> 50:00.760]  Oh, no!
[50:04.720 --> 50:05.280]  Ah!
[50:08.590 --> 50:09.950]  The bullets suck.
[50:10.470 --> 50:11.930]  Yeah, it's not good.
[50:13.510 --> 50:14.630]  Oh, God.
[50:15.450 --> 50:16.250]  I got a little stabbed.
[50:20.750 --> 50:22.330]  There's no way to get a Faggio
[50:22.330 --> 50:24.710]  far enough away from bullets, unfortunately.
[50:25.410 --> 50:26.230]  Are you guys on a roof?
[50:26.730 --> 50:28.050]  I keep spotting them on roofs.
[50:28.350 --> 50:29.710]  I'm so far away.
[50:31.050 --> 50:32.970]  I don't know where they'll ever find me.
[50:34.350 --> 50:35.710]  Oh, they found me!
[50:35.990 --> 50:36.470]  They found me!
[50:36.730 --> 50:37.710]  Oh, he sees me!
[50:39.330 --> 50:39.970]  Oh, no!
[50:41.570 --> 50:42.030]  Oh, no!
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.300]  Get outta there!
[50:50.600 --> 50:52.120]  Hey, Gavin. Hey, what's up?
[50:52.360 --> 50:55.300]  Oh, you kicked me off!
[51:00.730 --> 51:01.090]  Excuse me?
[51:01.770 --> 51:03.270]  Oh, shit.
[51:03.630 --> 51:04.110]  Oh, no.
[51:08.000 --> 51:08.820]  Where is he?
[51:09.980 --> 51:11.800]  He's on the stairs.
[51:14.320 --> 51:15.040]  Damn it.
[51:19.980 --> 51:21.980]  Oh, I hit a tree!
[51:23.460 --> 51:24.300]  Yeah, once you're in the air,
[51:24.400 --> 51:25.400]  this little son of a bitch is...
[51:25.400 --> 51:25.560]  Ah!
[51:30.200 --> 51:31.620]  Are you still on the rooftop?
[51:31.860 --> 51:32.340]  Where are you?
[51:34.440 --> 51:35.500]  Go, Rat, go!
[51:37.220 --> 51:38.100]  Oh, no!
[51:38.140 --> 51:39.560]  I see Eric! Kill him!
[51:39.900 --> 51:40.460]  Kill him!
[51:53.700 --> 51:55.480]  I'm so sorry it had to go...
[51:55.480 --> 51:57.160]  Uh-oh. Gavin?
[51:57.560 --> 51:57.720]  Yeah?
[52:02.700 --> 52:04.520]  I blocked it, I blocked it, I blocked it!
[52:04.560 --> 52:06.600]  The freeway, the freeway, the freedom, the freedom!
[52:08.060 --> 52:09.740]  There's nobody cut over on the street.
[52:10.100 --> 52:10.360]  Mm-mm.
[52:10.660 --> 52:11.540]  Let's fly over it.
[52:12.100 --> 52:12.720]  Oh.
[52:14.000 --> 52:14.780]  Oh!
[52:16.020 --> 52:17.280]  God damn it.
[52:18.420 --> 52:19.140]  It's hitting the horse!
[52:22.320 --> 52:22.780]  Woo!
[52:23.770 --> 52:25.360]  Flip back!
[52:27.600 --> 52:29.540]  Ah, someone else!
[52:30.280 --> 52:32.080]  Why does it spawn you so
[52:32.080 --> 52:34.440]  far away?!
[52:34.440 --> 52:36.220]  Damn you, Matt Bragg!
[52:38.220 --> 52:40.000]  Why do I keep hitting turbo
[52:40.000 --> 52:40.900]  when I don't want to?
[52:41.640 --> 52:43.360]  Damn you, Matt Bragg!
[52:58.710 --> 53:00.230]  Way out of position.
[53:01.130 --> 53:01.970]  Here we go!
[53:02.490 --> 53:03.330]  Here we go!
[53:03.770 --> 53:05.030]  I'm leading forwards for speed!
[53:06.690 --> 53:08.050]  I can loop around still.
[53:09.950 --> 53:10.070]  Woo!
[53:11.250 --> 53:12.330]  Damn it.
[53:14.470 --> 53:14.850]  No!
[53:15.870 --> 53:17.510]  Turbo on accident.
[53:18.070 --> 53:19.610]  Yeah, that happens a lot.
[53:19.770 --> 53:20.390]  Yeah.
[53:22.190 --> 53:24.290]  Oh, my back's getting holey.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.500]  I'm begging you to die!
[53:34.840 --> 53:35.080]  Woo!
[53:36.020 --> 53:37.920]  Wow! That was so much air!
[53:38.060 --> 53:40.520]  Are you shitting me?!
[53:42.020 --> 53:42.660]  Oh!
[53:43.540 --> 53:45.080]  I finally went down.
[53:50.770 --> 53:53.490]  I'm like 17 miles away.
[53:56.810 --> 53:57.690]  Oh, no!
[53:58.670 --> 53:59.270]  Shit!
[53:59.870 --> 54:00.450]  Ocean!
[54:11.970 --> 54:13.070]  Back in it!
[54:13.610 --> 54:14.510]  I'm so far away!
[54:16.350 --> 54:17.390]  Go, go!
[54:18.030 --> 54:18.630]  Go, go!
[54:18.930 --> 54:19.630]  Go, go!
[54:20.990 --> 54:21.870]  Oh, no!
[54:24.750 --> 54:25.350]  Oh, no!
[54:25.430 --> 54:26.490]  Don't go in the water!
[54:29.390 --> 54:30.790]  Oh, is it a wet bike?
[54:31.330 --> 54:33.410]  Oh, no! I just got here.
[54:33.650 --> 54:34.690]  It's gotta respawn, isn't it?
[54:34.830 --> 54:35.830]  Yep, there it is.
[54:37.410 --> 54:38.410]  Just left.
[54:38.770 --> 54:39.390]  Back to the city.
[54:41.030 --> 54:43.350]  I love living in the city.
[54:44.930 --> 54:50.590]  Oh, idiot!
[54:52.110 --> 54:53.290]  Get out of here, Gavin!
[54:54.030 --> 54:55.330]  How do you hit a telephone pole
[54:55.330 --> 54:56.310]  30 feet in the air?
[54:58.410 --> 54:59.510]  Their natural habitat.
[55:02.070 --> 55:02.470]  What?!
[55:02.470 --> 55:03.430]  I almost did the same thing.
[55:08.500 --> 55:09.880]  Damn, I almost had it.
[55:10.320 --> 55:11.060]  Oh, the golf course.
[55:12.380 --> 55:14.180]  Yeah, from where I am, it's a long way away.
[55:14.640 --> 55:14.980]  No.
[55:16.080 --> 55:17.100]  Is it on the golf course?
[55:17.660 --> 55:19.040]  No, I was just flying over it.
[55:19.240 --> 55:19.420]  Oh.
[55:22.140 --> 55:24.660]  Nick has it. That's why he's saying anything.
[55:25.520 --> 55:25.800]  No.
[55:26.340 --> 55:27.260]  Nobody's got it right now.
[55:27.620 --> 55:28.520]  Nick has it!
[55:29.180 --> 55:29.760]  Who has it?
[55:31.200 --> 55:32.120]  Who the hell is this?
[55:32.220 --> 55:32.960]  Oh, God, it's Eric.
[55:35.300 --> 55:35.640]  Hey, buddy.
[55:36.320 --> 55:36.740]  Buddy?
[55:39.020 --> 55:39.440]  Oh!
[55:41.400 --> 55:42.300]  I hit the wrong button!
[55:43.340 --> 55:44.320]  Yes, die!
[55:44.500 --> 55:45.840]  Oh, you went in the pool! Fuck you!
[55:47.180 --> 55:47.900]  I hate it!
[55:48.020 --> 55:49.660]  I only like being near pools!
[55:51.560 --> 55:52.360]  Oh, no!
[55:52.480 --> 55:53.980]  My worst enemy! A bump!
[55:54.220 --> 55:55.360]  Get over the...
[55:55.360 --> 55:56.060]  Fuck me!
[56:04.150 --> 56:04.830]  Where did it go?
[56:05.010 --> 56:05.810]  I think it just blew up again.
[56:06.790 --> 56:07.910]  Yeah, it blew up.
[56:09.650 --> 56:10.750]  Someone's still on it.
[56:11.590 --> 56:12.130]  No, it blew up.
[56:12.250 --> 56:12.810]  Oh, Nick has it.
[56:14.450 --> 56:15.910]  He's in this parking garage.
[56:16.150 --> 56:16.310]  Going up the hill.
[56:18.910 --> 56:19.650]  Going up and around.
[56:20.730 --> 56:22.370]  And Andrew went to find him.
[56:22.590 --> 56:23.150]  I got him!
[56:25.770 --> 56:26.730]  Hold your fire!
[56:26.850 --> 56:27.250]  Hold your fire!
[56:27.490 --> 56:27.850]  Whoa!
[56:27.850 --> 56:28.270]  Whoa!
[56:30.370 --> 56:31.270]  God damn it!
[56:32.530 --> 56:33.850]  I bounced too far.
[56:34.310 --> 56:35.850]  Oh, you kicked my bum!
[56:39.030 --> 56:40.110]  Oh, come on!
[56:40.170 --> 56:41.310]  It didn't work, but I did it!
[56:43.810 --> 56:45.170]  Oh, God, this is stupid.
[56:46.710 --> 56:47.710]  Fuck, he's gone!
[56:48.930 --> 56:49.690]  No, he's not!
[56:51.390 --> 56:52.270]  Oh, yes, he is!
[56:52.270 --> 56:52.610]  Fuck!
[56:55.470 --> 56:56.670]  Oh, no!
[56:57.230 --> 56:59.130]  You got a lot better at that!
[57:01.910 --> 57:03.310]  Is anybody on the...
[57:03.310 --> 57:04.110]  Oh, there it is.
[57:04.650 --> 57:07.250]  I respawned.
[57:11.230 --> 57:13.090]  You lying sack of shit, I see you.
[57:15.990 --> 57:16.550]  Eek!
[57:20.960 --> 57:21.800]  Get over!
[57:25.040 --> 57:26.880]  Oh, my God!
[57:27.500 --> 57:28.420]  Oh, no!
[57:30.120 --> 57:31.700]  I did it again!
[57:31.900 --> 57:32.500]  Go, rat, go!
[57:33.300 --> 57:34.060]  Kill the rat!
[57:34.500 --> 57:34.880]  Ow!
[57:40.760 --> 57:41.520]  No!
[57:43.100 --> 57:43.560]  No!
[57:46.200 --> 57:48.160]  I hate this fucking bike so much.
[57:49.180 --> 57:51.160]  It's so impossible to drive.
[57:52.260 --> 57:52.880]  Hup!
[57:53.440 --> 57:54.360]  Damn it!
[57:56.580 --> 57:59.220]  Must get on bike!
[58:01.480 --> 58:03.000]  Oh, Christ, it's Gavin!
[58:03.220 --> 58:03.480]  Hello!
[58:04.560 --> 58:05.640]  Oh, no!
[58:06.420 --> 58:08.820]  Oh, I should have killed you! I made a mistake!
[58:09.100 --> 58:09.900]  I spared you!
[58:11.360 --> 58:13.060]  You did, you spared me.
[58:14.680 --> 58:15.600]  Unintentional sparing.
[58:19.490 --> 58:21.070]  We're all locked in.
[58:21.650 --> 58:22.810]  So locked in.
[58:22.930 --> 58:23.650]  Where is he going?
[58:24.470 --> 58:25.570]  He doesn't know.
[58:25.750 --> 58:27.610]  You're asking that like there's a plan.
[58:28.010 --> 58:28.950]  There is a plan!
[58:29.210 --> 58:31.370]  There's a plan, it's hope!
[58:32.010 --> 58:34.070]  No, not me!
[58:35.470 --> 58:39.510]  Oh, Jesus, Geoff.
[58:39.690 --> 58:41.090]  This game time just ends up being
[58:41.090 --> 58:42.850]  two people parked opposite each other
[58:42.850 --> 58:44.450]  just firing machine guns.
[58:45.910 --> 58:46.730]  Did it respawn again?
[58:46.830 --> 58:48.450]  Oh, Geoff, you blew it.
[58:51.430 --> 58:52.450]  I need you to die, Geoff.
[58:52.450 --> 58:53.650]  Oh, you got me!
[58:55.010 --> 58:56.710]  Where the god damn did it go?
[58:58.410 --> 58:59.210]  It's respawned!
[59:00.250 --> 59:00.930]  Oh, roof!
[59:02.390 --> 59:02.570]  Woo!
[59:05.530 --> 59:07.610]  Just gotta time it. Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[59:09.630 --> 59:12.230]  Come on, come on, stick the landing, stick the landing.
[59:12.450 --> 59:13.710]  You stupid idiot.
[59:14.410 --> 59:15.030]  That was awesome.
[59:16.710 --> 59:17.510]  Stupid idiot.
[59:21.730 --> 59:22.690]  Fuck me.
[59:23.850 --> 59:25.030]  Oh, how'd you live?
[59:25.770 --> 59:26.110]  Oh, no.
[59:27.550 --> 59:28.810]  How the fu-
[59:28.810 --> 59:29.550]  Alright, fuck it.
[59:30.670 --> 59:32.530]  Oh, oh my god.
[59:32.990 --> 59:36.090]  Did you kill me with the fuckin' jet?
[59:36.310 --> 59:37.750]  I did, I just blocked you.
[59:38.150 --> 59:39.910]  Oh my god, that was funny.
[59:40.750 --> 59:42.470]  I just parked in front of you
[59:42.470 --> 59:43.570]  and farted you away.
[59:43.950 --> 59:45.550]  Yeah, that was fuckin' brilliant, Geoff.
[59:45.910 --> 59:47.050]  That was really good.
[59:48.170 --> 59:48.850]  Who's gonna win?
[59:49.550 --> 59:50.030]  Who?
[59:51.010 --> 59:51.470]  Nick!
[59:51.870 --> 59:53.690]  I don't have the goddamn bike!
[59:57.010 --> 59:58.470]  I think it's Andrew who has it.
[59:59.170 --> 01:00:00.490]  No, my bars are going up.
[01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:01.650]  I'm stuck in a pool.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.690]  There we go.
[01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:07.890]  Just let me down to earth.
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.710]  It's Eric! Eric's on the bike!
[01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.470]  My bar is not going up.
[01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.770]  It's like what happened last time.
[01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.790]  Is it fake bike?
[01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:15.870]  I guess so.
[01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.490]  My bar was not going up.
[01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:21.950]  It says that Nick still has it.
[01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:23.150]  We got a fake bike.
[01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.810]  I'm just sat on it.
[01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:27.990]  It doesn't do anything.
[01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:29.310]  Oh, my time's going up.
[01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:31.630]  No, that's bullshit!
[01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:34.190]  Oh, I went up and stopped.
[01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:37.190]  I'm puttin' on the same invisible hat
[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.350]  over and over and over.
[01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:43.370]  Kill Andrew! Kill him! Kill him!
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:44.970]  I think this is a fake bike.
[01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.010]  I think so too.
[01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.790]  We have to blow it up then.
[01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:50.910]  Let's blow it up.
[01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:52.330]  Let's blow it up.
[01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:56.310]  Maybe we can start a support ticket
[01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.190]  with Rockstar about the scoot scoot bikes.
[01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:00.990]  Somebody get Matt Bragg on the phone.
[01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:03.230]  Damn it!
[01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:07.730]  If we just leave it,
[01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.050]  it'll respawn eventually, right?
[01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.990]  Someone blow up
[01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.550]  the other one I'm on.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.020]  Oh, my time's going up again.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.040]  I might have the real one.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.300]  I'm just unloading onto this one.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.180]  Wait, what?
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.720]  Gavin's is going up.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.760]  Son of a... where is he?
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:29.200]  There he is!
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:33.740]  What time?
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.440]  And now I'm on fire from that!
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:36.300]  Oh!
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.540]  Oh!
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:40.720]  Oh!
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.300]  That was insane.
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.320]  That was pretty cool.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.720]  Bail!
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]  Oh, shit!
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.740]  It's running me over!
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.220]  Pick it up!
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.080]  Real Faggio!
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.620]  Oh, I hit the tree!
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.060]  Gavin! No!
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.220]  Be careful.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.080]  There's a guy that lives up here.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.240]  Gavin snuck the...
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.360]  Get him!
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.860]  He snuck into the landing.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.620]  Oh, Gavin's gonna win!
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.300]  We gotta kill him now!
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.940]  That's what I was saying, Nick!
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.360]  Gavin, you said he snuck!
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.260]  I can't stop him!
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.500]  Snook's away!
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.900]  I can't stop him!
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.140]  Kill him!
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:41.940]  No!
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.700]  The winning frame is me getting my head caved in with a machete.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:48.560]  Oh, man.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.320]  Oh, those were a lot of fun.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.800]  Yeah, that was a blast.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.220]  That was great.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.800]  We can traditionally fall back on this when our plan doesn't work.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.200]  Yeah, this is...
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.580]  That was...
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.100]  Bookmark job, absolutely.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.840]  I should have bookmarked the other ones.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.700]  I gotta say, I think the third one...
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.220]  The third one seemed like the best, Matt.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.220]  The one you weren't in?
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:09.960]  Yeah.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.120]  That one's great for cars.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.260]  Gavin, you do the outro.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:22.660]  Come on!
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:23.700]  You do it!
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.160]  Oh, thanks for watching!

[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.320]  Big shout out to Matt Bragg!
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.620]  Used to work with him.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.020]  Thanks for watching!
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:36.620]  Oh, okay.
