[00:00.000 --> 00:07.260]  Whoa! We did it, guys! Welcome back. The gang's all here. That's right, it's a five-player game of Reepo.
[00:07.580 --> 00:12.540]  It's Andrew. It's me. Andrew. Hi, Andrew. How you doing? What do I do? What? I'm good.
[00:13.200 --> 00:20.500]  Uh, so... Extract your coins. You're kind of silver. I like your color. Yep. So, uh, here's the thing, Andrew. With this game,
[00:20.740 --> 00:25.700]  uh, you are just running around. We're trying to grab stuff, put it into this cart over here
[00:25.700 --> 00:29.980]  to extract it all the way out. You see the money here needs to match what's in your
[00:29.980 --> 00:34.660]  upper right-hand screen. You can always make more, and then we spend on more stuff. And, check it out.
[00:36.100 --> 00:43.680]  Yeah, so, uh, there's this... Yeah, there's distance, uh, voice, proximity chat, and, uh, Gavin, how you doing?
[00:44.940 --> 00:46.940]  Nah, I was just pretending I was getting eaten back there. Oh, yeah.
[00:48.240 --> 00:53.800]  You sold it real good. So, I saw somebody in the comments said that that thing we were looking at,
[00:53.840 --> 00:57.420]  that you stick the crystals in, that, like, charges up your power-ups and shit that you buy.
[00:57.420 --> 01:02.360]  Yeah, yeah, well, we can get, like, weapons and stuff later. Yeah. Then, uh, if you want, you
[01:02.360 --> 01:09.940]  crouch a lot, and then hit Q to, like, hide. Okay. And that sort of... Up on the D-pad.
[01:12.140 --> 01:18.420]  And then, Andrew, a lot of stuff is, like, hidden in cabinet. You just kind of grab...
[01:18.420 --> 01:21.460]  Got it. Okay, I'm checking the fridge. Oh, there's something in here.
[01:21.460 --> 01:26.220]  It also shows you a couple of things, sometimes. Map is tab, and then you need to be really
[01:26.220 --> 01:30.180]  careful when you pick stuff up to not bump it into everything. Oh, bonus points. It's a little
[01:30.180 --> 01:35.560]  used money. A little delicate. Yeah. Like, like Geoff these days. Yeah, just delicate Geoff is what
[01:35.560 --> 01:40.500]  we call him. Whoa! Where'd you come from? Secret fridge? Yeah.
[01:42.360 --> 01:50.760]  You have a banjo on your knee? Oh. All right, I'm bringing this in. Wow, we're already almost
[01:50.760 --> 01:55.580]  there, guys. Hey, guys, I found $500 in cash. I wonder if I can smack it around and make it worth
[01:55.580 --> 02:02.520]  less money. No! Let's find out. No, no, no. Smash it. That was, like, $3,600. That was a lot of money.
[02:02.520 --> 02:10.200]  I've got a boat monster. Oh, no. I've got a challenge. Uh, it's not going well for me.
[02:10.400 --> 02:19.740]  What happened to your boat? Can you pull it off or something? He's Geoff. He's got the Geoff disease.
[02:21.520 --> 02:30.280]  What if we go behind him? You hurt me. I got thrown. I got thrown. I'm trying to pull it off.
[02:30.280 --> 02:34.860]  It won't let me. We might not always have enough money. It's poisonous vomit.
[02:36.760 --> 02:43.540]  Gavin, are you okay? I'm in the back here. Damn. I'm just gonna keep doing work with my vomit.
[02:46.800 --> 02:53.700]  Oh, my God. I choked on the thing I was carrying. You just reduced it by 120 from the vomit.
[02:57.050 --> 02:58.990]  Oh, thank God.
[03:03.310 --> 03:05.450]  $1,400 down the drain.
[03:08.210 --> 03:19.530]  Why are you screaming? Oh, what the fuck? What does that mean?
[03:22.170 --> 03:23.590]  Get underneath this.
[03:25.450 --> 03:30.730]  No, I'm fucking dead. I just watched Geoff die.
[03:32.610 --> 03:39.450]  Get away. Why are you just staring at me? Why are you just looking?
[03:47.130 --> 03:51.370]  Andrew, Andrew, get Geoff's head. I got it.
[03:51.370 --> 04:09.430]  Oh, it's me. Where were you? I was strapped in another room,
[04:09.810 --> 04:11.890]  waiting, and then I walked out and she spotted me instantly.
[04:13.570 --> 04:18.470]  Who's that? Is it Chris Clear? Yeah. All right, so Andrew's got Geoff's head. Put the head.
[04:19.070 --> 04:24.230]  We're gonna put it. We're gonna extract his head. You gotta put the head in the cart.
[04:24.910 --> 04:28.390]  Okay. This is how we bring him back to life since he died so fast.
[04:30.770 --> 04:34.190]  We do, but there's still more, isn't there? We have enough buns to...
[04:34.950 --> 04:38.350]  Yeah, we have just enough. Okay. Oh, barf guy! Barf guy! Look out!
[04:39.350 --> 04:41.370]  What? Oh, I've already had enough of him.
[04:42.150 --> 04:47.310]  Oh. So, what do you guys want to do? You want to finish this one and bring Geoff
[04:47.310 --> 04:50.130]  back so we can move on, or what do you want to do? Maybe we should close this door for now.
[04:50.950 --> 04:59.470]  Oh, shit! Oh, shit! The reaper! We may not be safe here. What about our stuff?
[05:01.150 --> 05:12.320]  Shut up. Guys! I'm gonna try to move it. I'm gonna try to move it.
[05:14.060 --> 05:16.560]  Andrew, you gotta crouch. Let's just see your flashlight.
[05:21.380 --> 05:30.240]  I see a robot. Oh, she's cutting up all the good. No! The bitch!
[05:35.110 --> 05:37.350]  Oh, no!
[05:49.190 --> 05:53.150]  She hacked the shit out of us. Oh, we lost so much money.
[05:53.390 --> 05:56.690]  How much were we up to? Oh, there's a champagne bottle. Let's add it back.
[05:57.130 --> 05:59.970]  Yeah, yeah. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. You're aiming at my penis.
[06:00.870 --> 06:06.470]  Where's Andrew? Andrew? Yeah. Andrew? Okay, come on. Come on.
[06:07.970 --> 06:14.870]  We're up to 11,000. Oh, that's still enough. That's great. I don't love it,
[06:14.910 --> 06:18.070]  but let's do it. Let's just to bring Geoff back. Yeah. All right, Andrew. Andrew,
[06:18.070 --> 06:21.670]  stay clear. Andrew, stay clear. Shit, okay. Do you want to see what happens if we do it?
[06:22.650 --> 06:31.290]  No. Okay. He's stalled. No, what are you doing? We said no. We said no, right? Everybody said no.
[06:31.290 --> 06:37.990]  We all said no. We all said no. Okay. Oh, he's good. Okay. Hey, guys. Yeah. You just don't want
[06:37.990 --> 06:44.310]  to get trapped. Hey, Geoff. Yeah. Oh, thanks, Geoff. Oh, that's what it was. Thanks, Geoff. All
[06:44.310 --> 06:48.670]  right. Everyone get in here. Oh, we all need to heal and then heal Geoff probably because he's
[06:48.670 --> 06:53.010]  I did die and then I respawned. Oh, really? My head was in the thing.
[06:53.170 --> 06:58.850]  Oh, so you got no health now. Okay. I have 26 health. I'll give you a little nip. I gave
[06:58.850 --> 07:04.390]  a I gave mine to Geoff because I'm nice. Thank you. Thank you. If you grab him by the back of
[07:04.390 --> 07:20.030]  the neck, Andrew, you can heal him up. I didn't know we could be attacked there. That was crazy.
[07:21.010 --> 07:27.550]  That was wild. Yeah, no kidding. All right. Are we all here? Yeah. Andrew, it's the store.
[07:27.770 --> 07:34.910]  This is where we buy upgrades. Okay. But how much money? We only have 11k.
[07:35.430 --> 07:43.210]  No, I'm okay. Thank you. That's a grenade. I don't want that. That's scary. These are not
[07:43.210 --> 07:49.650]  for everyone. Also, Andrew, it's for everybody. It's per person. We have almost enough for
[07:49.650 --> 07:52.090]  everybody to get one thing. I'm going to get a stamina upgrade.
[07:55.050 --> 08:01.690]  Andrew, you just kind of put it in the buy pile. Got it. All right, Geoff and Gavin,
[08:01.770 --> 08:04.470]  what are you guys doing? Oh, hey, look, does it look like we're here? Gavin,
[08:04.650 --> 08:08.410]  what are you doing? Oh, I was just gonna let you guys buy stuff.
[08:09.730 --> 08:13.930]  There's enough money for... Oh, never mind. Oh, you want my health upgrade, guys?
[08:14.730 --> 08:18.070]  That's right. Check this out.
[08:25.650 --> 08:30.310]  Yeah, you can't even buy that shit.
[08:37.230 --> 08:42.370]  It's like I told you last time. It's like I told you don't be there. It's a different thing.
[08:42.930 --> 08:45.470]  I was curious to see if that would kill him or not, so I didn't say anything.
[08:45.630 --> 08:52.990]  Oh, can you guys see if I look cool? Yeah, show us. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[08:55.190 --> 08:56.970]  When do you start looking cool?
[09:02.710 --> 09:07.210]  You spent $3,000 on that? Nah, I didn't buy it.
[09:07.670 --> 09:13.750]  Wow. You can just use it? You can just set it off? Wow. That's awesome. That's cool.
[09:15.530 --> 09:20.430]  All right, everyone pick up your individual upgrade and then hit E.
[09:24.910 --> 09:30.210]  Man, Reaper on the first room, basically, was pretty rough. Yeah, pretty rough. All right,
[09:30.210 --> 09:33.870]  boys, you good? You ready? Yeah, ready, boys. Let's do it. Okay. Let's go.
[09:35.990 --> 09:43.490]  This one's for the boys. Oh, is it Friday again? You know it's Friday, baby. You know it's Friday.
[09:44.090 --> 09:45.010]  Friday's for the boys.
[09:48.730 --> 09:52.430]  Uh, okay, Gab, are you like a pro at this game now that you played with the old age people?
[09:52.630 --> 09:59.970]  Your health? I might be worse. I'm at 90 health. I'm at 90 health. Where are you guys at? 56.
[10:01.950 --> 10:09.170]  46. Uh, Nick, I can give you more if you need it. I'm okay. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm all right.
[10:09.390 --> 10:12.370]  Okay. I don't think I've ever gone to a locked door.
[10:14.330 --> 10:22.250]  No. Anything cool in here? No. Doesn't seem like it. Okay. Andrew, tab is how you look at the map.
[10:25.070 --> 10:30.090]  Okay. Oh, jam this door more for me. Got a diamond. There you go. Oh, nice. How much is that?
[10:30.330 --> 10:37.910]  2,400. 2,400. So we have two extractions here, Andrew, so we can be mindful of like getting the
[10:37.910 --> 10:42.330]  money quick, like the 10,000 that we need, and then bringing anyone back to life, and then we
[10:42.330 --> 10:47.830]  do a second extraction. It should just be all gravy. Okay. I have a vial of something terrible.
[10:49.170 --> 10:54.970]  Something. What? Okay. Guitars are expensive. Holy damn. Yeah. More than a diamond.
[10:56.690 --> 11:02.230]  Wow. Let me look at the old map. Oh, Andrew, there's something in the corner over here.
[11:03.950 --> 11:10.350]  Yeah. It said so. Did you grab anything? What happened to it? Did you grab it? Or? Oh,
[11:10.410 --> 11:15.330]  you broke it. You broke it. What? Yeah, you broke it. Okay. No, that's all right. It's okay. It happens.
[11:15.330 --> 11:21.470]  No, it was a glitch. It was a glitch. Yeah. Common glitch.
[11:23.950 --> 11:29.750]  Uh, we're at like the 10 just about. Oh, really?
[11:30.670 --> 11:34.610]  Yeah. Yeah. I think we're at like 10-1 and we just need like 10-1-22, so we're almost there.
[11:35.930 --> 11:42.790]  Oh, his eyes are getting fucking zapped. How do we? Good luck.
[11:55.170 --> 11:58.830]  Why do we keep trying to go into this room? Let's close this room.
[12:06.370 --> 12:11.710]  I think we have to go there next, Andrew. Yeah, yeah, you're right. You got it? Hell yeah.
[12:14.890 --> 12:19.430]  By the way, if you use the scroll wheel, you can bring it closer to your body so it's not so far.
[12:25.490 --> 12:32.630]  You just beat me in the head. Eric, Eric, check this out. It's a trap.
[12:41.220 --> 12:44.960]  Stupid. All right, let's get all this stuff in there. We'll extract it.
[12:51.640 --> 12:53.640]  I beamed him in the back of the head with a ball.
[12:54.760 --> 12:59.400]  My money. Let me put this fucking trophy in. Yeah, do it. Okay. There you go. That thing's lethal.
[12:59.400 --> 12:59.780]  Cool.
[13:02.760 --> 13:11.060]  You going this way? No, no, it's, it's, I think. Uh-oh, uh, Eric, run. From what? Where are we running from?
[13:11.480 --> 13:18.580]  There's a thing. Okay, well, what's it look like? It looks like a grim reaper bloke. We need to,
[13:18.660 --> 13:23.320]  we need to go back where we came from to extract. Open the door, open the door, open the door, open the door, let me in.
[13:29.400 --> 13:29.760]  Oh.
[13:56.480 --> 13:59.280]  Damn it.
[14:18.830 --> 14:23.050]  Okay, we have enough. Let's, let's get Geoff back again. Geoff died again.
[14:25.270 --> 14:30.530]  I, oh, I did say run. Can we get this door out of the way? Here, let me help you. Yeah.
[14:30.530 --> 14:31.930]  Oh my god.
[14:45.410 --> 14:46.370]  There we go.
[14:48.910 --> 14:53.030]  All right, Geoff. All right, Geoff, you're coming back here. We got you, buddy.
[14:58.650 --> 14:59.610]  Okay, everyone back up.
[15:00.550 --> 15:00.870]  Yep.
[15:02.950 --> 15:08.110]  Oh, this game's easy. Okay, yeah, sure. Oh god. We gotta do one more extraction. Yeah,
[15:08.130 --> 15:12.830]  we have one more extraction, so we get the 6,000, like the additional 6,000 here, and it's gonna go
[15:12.830 --> 15:18.190]  towards, uh, what, yeah, what we can walk away with. Oh, cool, we'll get another 10k. Hey, it's Geoff.
[15:18.390 --> 15:21.310]  So, I tried to shut the fucking door, but it didn't work.
[15:23.250 --> 15:27.170]  I came running through it, that's probably why. All right. It smashed that door and all of
[15:27.170 --> 15:31.170]  Dude, it broke so much of our stuff. That was crazy. Yeah, it broke my life.
[15:32.650 --> 15:36.470]  Saved your head, though. Thank you. We are heading towards it. Yeah, so let's be careful.
[15:37.730 --> 15:40.310]  This is where it was. Do you think we should go right or straight?
[15:42.710 --> 15:49.130]  What's the first thing that comes into your head? Uh, Ronnie or Lithgow? Hey, Ronnie, this is,
[15:49.650 --> 15:55.630]  this is just a single room. This is? Yeah, this is right here. This is just a single room.
[15:55.630 --> 15:57.360]  I only crouch from now on.
[15:57.910 --> 16:06.550]  Are we outside? Oh, a box. Oh, well, we probably chose poorly then. Yeah, that's
[16:07.470 --> 16:11.590]  a good hiding spot, though. Bad place to die.
[16:13.490 --> 16:23.230]  Well, how do I look? Where are you? Right here. Gavin, where are you? Hello.
[16:23.230 --> 16:31.830]  Oh, where the hell are you? Oh, I'm right here. The cart got moved. Am I stupid? Are you behind
[16:31.830 --> 16:34.870]  the door? I was going to keep going. Don't happen. I can't be behind the door.
[16:41.290 --> 16:44.610]  That took longer than it should have. Look at you. You look so...
[16:44.610 --> 16:47.610]  Now it looks like someone's peeing on you. Oh, I'm getting slammed in.
[16:48.470 --> 16:53.270]  Look at this. You see this yellow? You're pissing in my mouth and Andrew's laughing.
[16:53.270 --> 16:59.210]  He's a piss boy. No, I was laughing because I slammed the door off the hinges.
[16:59.350 --> 17:04.010]  Yeah, Andrew came in behind you and slammed the lid on my head. Ow. Shit, I got hurt.
[17:05.250 --> 17:10.890]  That hurt you? A little bit. Hey, man. Oh, exploring here? So, yes, it's Andrew. If you
[17:10.890 --> 17:16.070]  hold tab, you can see the question mark. Oh, okay. You found the ocarina of time? Cool.
[17:16.610 --> 17:20.790]  Yeah. Is it a fourth dimensional ocarina? Hell yeah. I don't know what the fuck it is.
[17:25.430 --> 17:27.070]  Okay, there you go, buddy.
[17:34.730 --> 17:37.950]  It's deeper. Like, look at the map. There's like so much further to go.
[17:38.870 --> 17:41.230]  There's like so much further to go. Oh, I didn't see that.
[17:41.710 --> 17:45.750]  What the hell? Come on. Look at all the money we lost. What are you doing?
[17:48.070 --> 17:49.610]  Nick is getting in the way of the cart.
[17:50.490 --> 17:52.530]  Sorry. Oh, yeah. What's up, Geoff?
[17:53.850 --> 17:59.730]  Uh, nothing. Oh, you were saying, guys, we're about to all die. Yeah, guys, stop
[17:59.730 --> 18:03.250]  fucking destroying everything. Oh, okay. Talk to Nick. Yeah, the last time you said that,
[18:03.270 --> 18:05.730]  that, uh, that creature came in and killed you.
[18:07.630 --> 18:10.530]  All right, here we go. Right here. Oh, there it is.
[18:13.810 --> 18:17.290]  All right, we're good. Do we have enough money? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The,
[18:17.290 --> 18:21.710]  the second extraction is just gravy. Hell yeah. I think we did it.
[18:23.550 --> 18:26.250]  Yeah, I don't see any yellow on the map. Are we good? Yeah.
[18:27.090 --> 18:29.290]  Are we missing someone? Are we good? You guys just want to extract?
[18:29.790 --> 18:34.150]  You got any, anyone else have anything? Okay, let's do it. I think we should do it.
[18:34.570 --> 18:39.690]  All right. Easy peasy. Yeah. Oh, there's something right here. A crown.
[18:41.590 --> 18:44.210]  Oh, you want to wear it? Oh, good fan. Uh, here, let me put it on you.
[18:45.990 --> 18:49.510]  What? No, it's worth money. Don't put it, don't put it on him. Just put it in the cart.
[18:49.510 --> 18:53.810]  Oh, that looks cool. Okay, way to go, Andrew. That's worth less money. That's all right.
[18:53.990 --> 18:58.150]  That looked really cool for one second. Yeah, I was trying to jump over him. I was a little short.
[18:58.470 --> 19:02.350]  A little short. That's okay. Oh, that's a lot of money.
[19:04.610 --> 19:08.130]  All right, now I just have to get out. Right. Oh, we should start running now. Go, go, go, go.
[19:08.430 --> 19:12.670]  Yeah, might as well. What? Why are we running? What do you mean, what? We're leaving.
[19:13.830 --> 19:21.400]  Oh, no! Oh, no! Come to me, Eric! Come to me! Come to my voice! Come to my voice, Eric!
[19:21.400 --> 19:25.220]  Come to my voice! Come over here! No, you're going to the door! You're going over the door!
[19:25.400 --> 19:27.840]  Okay. I see, I see. Over here, Kevin!
[19:33.300 --> 19:36.880]  Yeah. Oh, shit! It's popping off!
[19:39.100 --> 19:40.100]  Why can't I duck?
[19:47.800 --> 19:51.200]  Finally, somebody else dies but Geoff.
[19:51.200 --> 19:57.380]  Welcome to the nether realm. I didn't realize that thing could crouch.
[19:59.200 --> 20:01.080]  I had one health when I ran into it.
[20:05.240 --> 20:08.400]  I just crack it up. Andrew, we got to get out of here. Come on.
[20:09.360 --> 20:13.220]  Come on. Get out. Get out the heads. Everyone else is dead. No, they can go without us.
[20:14.340 --> 20:17.240]  Everyone else died. The last words to me were, yeah, we're good.
[20:21.460 --> 20:25.500]  I heard, yeah, we're good. And then all of a sudden just laid out.
[20:27.200 --> 20:30.180]  I hope we didn't have to grab anyone's head. We don't have to grab anyone's head, right?
[20:30.920 --> 20:35.380]  Hopefully not. Guys. Oh, cool. You're back. Oh, thank God. Oh, great job. That was terrifying.
[20:36.220 --> 20:43.340]  Holy shit. Yeah, that was fucked. Eric, were you at the table with us when we were killed?
[20:43.360 --> 20:47.620]  Yes, I was. I was. I was under it. I'm just going to get a health pack. Oh, man.
[20:50.380 --> 20:54.120]  Goodness gracious. I'm going to get a health up. I'm going to get a health upgrade.
[20:55.480 --> 20:59.020]  When you upgrade your health, you get that health back. Whoa.
[21:01.040 --> 21:01.820]  I don't know.
[21:10.520 --> 21:14.780]  All right. We still have three thousand to spend. I could use a health. Is there another one?
[21:15.500 --> 21:18.480]  Yeah, there's a three thousand one right here. Bottom right.
[21:22.120 --> 21:23.560]  I'm getting dinged.
[21:25.280 --> 21:32.180]  Get away, Nick. Andrew. Get away. Get away. No, let it go. Uh oh. No.
[21:34.160 --> 21:37.100]  Cool. Get away. Okay, everyone just remember.
[21:46.740 --> 21:52.480]  Shall we? Yes. We got one more in us before we gotta stop. Yeah, let's go.
[21:59.280 --> 22:03.840]  Geoff, Gavin threw a grenade at me. Were you all right? He'll do that. Did you live? He definitely
[22:03.840 --> 22:12.260]  do that. He knocked me down. Yeah. That echo of your cough is fantastic.
[22:14.780 --> 22:17.280]  Laughing makes me cough sometimes. Okay, let me.
[22:18.960 --> 22:23.100]  Uh, it does not. It gives you more. When you do the health upgrade, it gives you more health,
[22:23.180 --> 22:27.000]  but like I'm still missing the three points that I was missing before.
[22:27.540 --> 22:37.260]  So like I went from 100 to 120 and like 97 to 117. So that's it. Okay, you guys ready? Yeah,
[22:37.320 --> 22:43.380]  let's do it. Can anyone give me a little health? I'm down to one. Yeah, I'll give you a little
[22:43.380 --> 22:51.720]  nip. I'll give you some. Okay, just a little taste. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, the castle. Harry Potter land.
[22:53.180 --> 22:58.040]  All right. What are you? I'm this guy. There you go. Thank you. Gavin's home field advantage.
[22:58.200 --> 23:04.400]  What are you up to, Nick? Uh, 11. Let me give you some more. Okay. I think I'm a paw guy.
[23:04.640 --> 23:07.680]  Thank you. There you go. Well, you're from there. There you go. Yeah, you're from there.
[23:08.240 --> 23:14.100]  Hogwarts? Yeah, that's true. This is your legacy. It's not Hogwarts, but they leave Hogwarts.
[23:14.780 --> 23:19.060]  Oh, oh, oh, Nick. I got a bunch of stuff. Okay, sweet. I'll leave this here in the middle.
[23:19.720 --> 23:22.880]  Oh, stairs. All right. That's worth less money now. Thank you.
[23:26.200 --> 23:33.000]  What's going on in here? Got a diamond. Found a room. How do we get up here? What is in here?
[23:34.540 --> 23:41.100]  What's up these steps? Stairs. Oh, that looks bad. I'm not getting in that.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.400]  Oh, there's a diamond up there. I wonder if I can launch to it.
[23:46.360 --> 23:51.880]  Diamond up there? Yeah, you see up here? Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it's not diamond. It's just potions.
[23:53.540 --> 23:55.900]  Oh, it's up. Oh, another potion.
[23:59.460 --> 24:06.640]  Oh, a globe. Oh, blind man. Don't make noise. I think the blind guy's here.
[24:07.180 --> 24:09.760]  Oh, cool.
[24:32.730 --> 24:59.540]  Geoff knows where he's. Oh, he's in there.
[25:13.710 --> 25:15.310]  Is there? Hey, guys.
[25:16.190 --> 25:19.230]  Is he still here?
[25:43.540 --> 25:47.200]  Is Eric dead?
[25:50.420 --> 25:54.940]  Hey, Gavin, that's exactly what happened. I rolled into him. Good guess.
[25:55.640 --> 25:58.720]  Oh, now he's coming for Geoff.
[25:58.980 --> 26:02.440]  I went in the cauldron, it shot me out, and I got blown away.
[26:03.260 --> 26:07.780]  Hey, what's up, Geoff? Welcome to the party. He tripped. He tripped on Geoff.
[26:07.820 --> 26:11.700]  Yeah. Yeah, he walked right into you, buddy, and then you got blown the fuck away.
[26:12.080 --> 26:13.800]  Andrew's still in his full health. Andrew's doing great.
[26:14.800 --> 26:15.600]  Yeah, Andrew's an alien.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.580]  Yeah, I jumped in the cauldron, and then it shot me out right in front of him,
[26:20.640 --> 26:24.420]  and then he just... I didn't even see him. I just died. I just got fucking blasted.
[26:24.960 --> 26:26.140]  Don't worry, I saw it.
[26:27.360 --> 26:28.920]  How did you get Gavin?
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.720]  I can see who's behind me, and I said something.
[26:31.880 --> 26:34.740]  Okay, we got the head. Let's go down there where he's not.
[26:35.220 --> 26:36.440]  He just snuck up on me.
[26:37.880 --> 26:38.480]  Sneaky one.
[26:38.820 --> 26:40.420]  Yeah, this is a tough one.
[26:41.480 --> 26:42.680]  Nick is injured.
[26:43.680 --> 26:46.780]  Yeah, Nick's... which is funny, because Andrew has full health and can heal him.
[26:48.540 --> 26:50.380]  Yeah. Okay, let's see.
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.280]  God, I really... I love this game. I really love this game.
[26:56.500 --> 26:57.420]  Andrew's playing on a controller.
[26:57.760 --> 26:58.320]  Keep that here.
[26:58.680 --> 26:59.260]  What? How?
[26:59.440 --> 27:00.880]  I didn't know that.
[27:00.940 --> 27:01.960]  How can you play on a controller?
[27:04.060 --> 27:06.180]  Uh... I think we're okay. Okay, for now.
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.360]  All right. Seemed to be all right.
[27:08.900 --> 27:09.260]  Yeah.
[27:10.040 --> 27:10.640]  Oh, no.
[27:10.740 --> 27:11.280]  Oh, that sounds bad.
[27:11.640 --> 27:12.620]  I think he shot Nick.
[27:12.680 --> 27:13.820]  What the fuck was that?
[27:14.260 --> 27:15.620]  He heard me, and he took a shot.
[27:16.900 --> 27:17.620]  Be quiet.
[27:17.620 --> 27:17.780]  Shit.
[27:19.120 --> 27:21.120]  Okay, see what we can find.
[27:21.460 --> 27:22.260]  How are we for money again?
[27:22.520 --> 27:23.260]  Okay, you need...
[27:23.260 --> 27:24.100]  I thought that was a person.
[27:24.280 --> 27:24.820]  You need nine grand.
[27:26.500 --> 27:26.900]  Okay.
[27:27.160 --> 27:27.280]  Okay.
[27:27.600 --> 27:28.400]  Oh, what's this?
[27:28.560 --> 27:29.000]  Oh, mingba.
[27:30.540 --> 27:32.200]  Oh, this is 2,400.
[27:33.500 --> 27:33.820]  Nice.
[27:34.340 --> 27:34.740]  Okay.
[27:36.580 --> 27:37.560]  Doing it. Do it.
[27:40.960 --> 27:41.640]  In the car.
[27:42.080 --> 27:43.680]  Oh. Oh, 3,000.
[27:44.820 --> 27:45.860]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[27:46.160 --> 27:46.640]  I'll help you.
[27:49.760 --> 27:51.900]  This thing is fucking huge.
[27:53.720 --> 27:54.740]  Okay, we just need...
[27:57.300 --> 27:58.080]  There's a monkey.
[27:58.300 --> 27:59.280]  What the hell was that?
[27:59.920 --> 28:00.900]  Did you hear that?
[28:02.300 --> 28:02.740]  No.
[28:02.880 --> 28:05.020]  It sounded like a scream, but they're all dead.
[28:06.860 --> 28:08.280]  How much is that one monkey worth?
[28:09.200 --> 28:09.640]  900.
[28:11.300 --> 28:11.740]  Okay.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.400]  Oh, we're just barely short.
[28:14.300 --> 28:16.100]  Walking around a pile of cash.
[28:16.280 --> 28:17.540]  It's like right between them.
[28:20.580 --> 28:21.140]  Okay, yes.
[28:21.640 --> 28:21.700]  Okay.
[28:22.300 --> 28:23.140]  Oh, I've never seen this room.
[28:24.180 --> 28:25.380]  Nothing valuable here.
[28:27.720 --> 28:28.200]  Okay.
[28:28.480 --> 28:30.120]  They're doing great as a little team.
[28:33.480 --> 28:34.460]  Oh, got something.
[28:35.960 --> 28:36.440]  Perfect.
[28:36.660 --> 28:37.040]  We got it.
[28:37.140 --> 28:37.280]  All right.
[28:39.280 --> 28:40.860]  Please tell me you saw that.
[28:41.200 --> 28:42.480]  Please tell me you saw that.
[28:42.540 --> 28:43.520]  What an idiot.
[28:43.980 --> 28:45.020]  What an idiot.
[28:47.020 --> 28:48.460]  Oh, my God.
[28:48.980 --> 28:50.220]  We just need a little more money.
[28:50.240 --> 28:53.640]  I finally saw the money on the screen drop.
[28:53.860 --> 28:54.260]  God.
[28:56.880 --> 28:57.700]  We're idiots.
[28:57.900 --> 28:59.300]  Oh, there's cash on the thing.
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.380]  Good, he saw it.
[29:03.640 --> 29:04.400]  We're fools.
[29:07.020 --> 29:07.460]  What?
[29:09.560 --> 29:09.700]  Why?
[29:09.960 --> 29:11.960]  $600 item on top of this box.
[29:12.980 --> 29:13.860]  $600 items.
[29:14.460 --> 29:14.900]  $600.
[29:15.840 --> 29:16.640]  We got plenty.
[29:16.740 --> 29:17.660]  Let's go get them back.
[29:17.660 --> 29:18.300]  Yes.
[29:19.560 --> 29:20.040]  Nice.
[29:20.180 --> 29:21.120]  And we go back to where we started.
[29:23.060 --> 29:24.620]  Oh, oh, no.
[29:26.240 --> 29:27.600]  This is boys.
[29:27.760 --> 29:28.880]  You might have to reorganize.
[29:29.140 --> 29:30.440]  Can you help balance that on this?
[29:35.060 --> 29:36.800]  Oh, my God.
[29:36.920 --> 29:39.660]  Nick is just like, he's moving the monkey.
[29:39.760 --> 29:41.500]  The $400 monkey.
[29:41.980 --> 29:42.400]  God.
[29:44.360 --> 29:50.420]  Dude, he is just Nick is like so singularly focused.
[29:50.520 --> 29:51.860]  It's so funny.
[29:55.640 --> 29:57.280]  Open those cabinets.
[29:57.820 --> 30:00.080]  I don't think I'm ever going to ask Nick to help me move.
[30:00.380 --> 30:06.460]  No, he gets like locked in and it just becomes this.
[30:07.420 --> 30:08.840]  This is like a big tunnel vision guy.
[30:09.340 --> 30:09.720]  Yes.
[30:09.820 --> 30:10.460]  Oh, big time.
[30:11.260 --> 30:13.160]  I hope they were watching you and not me.
[30:13.700 --> 30:16.780]  Oh, no, we were watching you, buddy.
[30:17.960 --> 30:19.220]  There's another thing.
[30:19.440 --> 30:20.700]  It's going to get bumped out again.
[30:30.210 --> 30:32.470]  Just watching him bumble around.
[30:33.470 --> 30:35.250]  That's so funny.
[30:36.990 --> 30:39.830]  God, these guys, these fucking guys.
[30:40.130 --> 30:40.450]  I'll scare you with this.
[30:41.610 --> 30:41.970]  Ding.
[30:42.330 --> 30:42.690]  Ding.
[30:48.490 --> 30:49.390]  Literal wrecking ball.
[30:58.210 --> 31:00.330]  He's put it right where Nick's going to run it over.
[31:00.990 --> 31:01.530]  Yeah, he did.
[31:01.650 --> 31:01.990]  He did.
[31:02.050 --> 31:02.670]  He ran it over.
[31:03.070 --> 31:03.770]  He ran it over.
[31:06.050 --> 31:07.190]  So fucking funny.
[31:07.810 --> 31:08.110]  Stop.
[31:08.170 --> 31:08.350]  Stop.
[31:08.410 --> 31:08.890]  You need the other.
[31:08.990 --> 31:09.430]  OK, cool.
[31:09.490 --> 31:09.930]  Good, good.
[31:09.930 --> 31:11.890]  OK, it's going to be worthless.
[31:12.370 --> 31:13.230]  They don't have enough.
[31:13.490 --> 31:15.170]  They don't have enough.
[31:15.430 --> 31:16.690]  Oh, my God.
[31:16.690 --> 31:18.990]  They fought this thing so bad.
[31:21.650 --> 31:22.450]  OK.
[31:25.350 --> 31:27.230]  These fucking idiots.
[31:27.330 --> 31:27.710]  There we go.
[31:28.390 --> 31:29.030]  There you go.
[31:30.270 --> 31:30.730]  Fuck.
[31:31.930 --> 31:33.530]  I got fucking right.
[31:35.090 --> 31:36.570]  Oh, shit.
[31:38.790 --> 31:40.990]  Oh, they just dinged just enough.
[31:40.990 --> 31:41.330]  What the fuck is that?
[31:41.430 --> 31:41.970]  What is that?
[31:42.410 --> 31:43.470]  What's following Nick?
[31:44.210 --> 31:45.150]  Oh, oh, a duck.
[31:45.450 --> 31:46.210]  A little ducky.
[31:46.390 --> 31:47.310]  I don't know what the duck does.
[31:49.310 --> 31:50.330]  I don't want the big things.
[31:50.410 --> 31:50.790]  They're too heavy.
[31:53.990 --> 31:54.390]  Duck?
[31:54.590 --> 31:54.690]  He.
[31:57.310 --> 31:58.310]  Maybe I can carry them.
[31:58.770 --> 32:00.210]  There's a blue ghost back there.
[32:00.270 --> 32:01.330]  I don't know what that means.
[32:01.830 --> 32:02.530]  Here, let's get this.
[32:03.870 --> 32:04.070]  OK.
[32:07.610 --> 32:08.010]  Oh, shit.
[32:08.030 --> 32:08.930]  It's an alien.
[32:08.950 --> 32:10.030]  What the fuck?
[32:10.210 --> 32:11.110]  What is that?
[32:12.390 --> 32:13.950]  Is it running away from?
[32:14.250 --> 32:14.690]  Oh, God.
[32:14.850 --> 32:16.970]  You just lost like two grand off this thing.
[32:19.050 --> 32:19.610]  All right, fellas.
[32:19.830 --> 32:20.170]  They've done it.
[32:20.930 --> 32:21.650]  Holy shit.
[32:22.170 --> 32:22.830]  That was well done.
[32:23.270 --> 32:24.450]  Hopefully, their heads didn't fall out.
[32:26.770 --> 32:28.410]  Yeah, our heads are fine.
[32:29.370 --> 32:30.110]  Hope so.
[32:37.530 --> 32:37.970]  Yeah.
[32:38.650 --> 32:39.190]  Well done.
[32:41.610 --> 32:44.610]  Mutt and Geoff just fucking it up.
[32:44.670 --> 32:47.790]  You guys are a fucking pair.
[32:48.430 --> 32:48.910]  How?
[32:49.510 --> 32:49.990]  How?
[32:50.390 --> 32:50.610]  What?
[32:50.970 --> 32:51.150]  What?
[32:52.550 --> 32:55.970]  Moving the monkey to be like, all right, we got to make space for this monkey.
[32:56.310 --> 33:01.690]  Let's just knock around this $3,000 item until it was worth nothing.
[33:01.750 --> 33:02.370]  I'm sorry, man.
[33:02.550 --> 33:04.090]  Getting food extra from the dead guy.
[33:04.170 --> 33:04.750]  Shut up, shut up, shut up.
[33:04.770 --> 33:05.650]  Gunman, gunman.
[33:44.650 --> 33:45.670]  He's right there.
[33:45.770 --> 33:46.250]  He's right there.
[33:55.440 --> 33:56.240]  Holy shit.
[33:56.800 --> 33:59.920]  OK, so don't click the duck.
[34:00.040 --> 34:02.380]  He'll attack you if you click him while you're clicking other stuff.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.280]  I just remember what he does.
[34:04.640 --> 34:04.800]  OK.
[34:05.480 --> 34:05.960]  All right.
[34:07.640 --> 34:08.440]  I'll do this.
[34:08.860 --> 34:09.320]  I got you.
[34:10.460 --> 34:10.840]  What do you have?
[34:11.660 --> 34:11.940]  Yeah.
[34:13.920 --> 34:15.180]  So how much they were worth?
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.120]  Yeah.
[34:16.760 --> 34:17.220]  Don't worry.
[34:17.340 --> 34:18.940]  I guess all five of us will work on this.
[34:19.580 --> 34:21.740]  Yeah, it's heavy.
[34:22.280 --> 34:22.940]  It's heavy.
[34:23.120 --> 34:23.760]  You got it.
[34:23.860 --> 34:25.660]  If we're going to listen to this, we need to look up.
[34:25.940 --> 34:27.400]  Yeah, anyway, you got it.
[34:29.680 --> 34:31.040]  Oh, it's on a ball.
[34:31.560 --> 34:32.440]  I'll move the ball.
[34:32.900 --> 34:33.360]  Hold the thing.
[34:34.580 --> 34:35.720]  I'm holding it now.
[34:36.180 --> 34:36.460]  OK.
[34:37.460 --> 34:37.880]  Perfect.
[34:38.620 --> 34:39.240]  That's great.
[34:40.080 --> 34:40.380]  Yeah.
[34:43.280 --> 34:45.340]  We have to extract from a different place, right?
[34:46.120 --> 34:46.380]  Yeah.
[34:47.240 --> 34:48.300]  Are we good?
[34:48.460 --> 34:48.920]  We're good, right?
[34:48.980 --> 34:49.860]  I've got one health.
[34:50.860 --> 34:51.420]  Yeah, same.
[34:52.140 --> 34:54.480]  Oh, how do I get help?
[34:56.400 --> 34:57.980]  That was a shotgun, it sounds like.
[34:59.700 --> 35:02.040]  Oh, do you think he's blowing the alien away?
[35:03.820 --> 35:04.580]  Hey, guys.
[35:04.780 --> 35:06.820]  Why are you talking in front of him?
[35:07.160 --> 35:07.820]  I did not.
[35:07.900 --> 35:08.820]  I didn't see him.
[35:09.280 --> 35:14.020]  I just heard him in the distance and it was like, oh, shit, maybe he's blowing the alien away.
[35:14.260 --> 35:17.000]  And then I walked through and there he is in the doorway.
[35:23.740 --> 35:24.060]  Yes!
[35:38.050 --> 35:40.610]  Is he shooting at the alien and he got blasted?
[35:45.730 --> 35:46.990]  Oh, no, who died?
[35:47.930 --> 35:48.650]  Gavin and Eric.
[35:52.060 --> 35:55.080]  Let's go this way.
[35:56.160 --> 35:56.380]  All right.
[35:56.680 --> 35:58.280]  Oh, wait, no, I think we have to go where he is.
[36:00.340 --> 36:01.120]  I'll scout ahead.
[36:01.320 --> 36:02.380]  Here, somebody carry this head.
[36:03.860 --> 36:04.440]  I got it.
[36:04.920 --> 36:05.220]  Where is it?
[36:05.220 --> 36:05.900]  Where do we got to go?
[36:06.000 --> 36:06.960]  Do we got to go to the blue?
[36:08.160 --> 36:09.480]  That's where we came from.
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.580]  We need to go left by the cauldron stairs.
[36:16.640 --> 36:18.600]  He's going to wake up with a hell of a headache, Andrew.
[36:21.040 --> 36:22.120]  At least he'll wake up.
[36:22.920 --> 36:24.040]  I don't hear no plates.
[36:24.500 --> 36:25.860]  You might not remember as much.
[36:27.320 --> 36:28.160]  Works for me.
[36:28.740 --> 36:30.100]  He forgets this part, honestly.
[36:31.200 --> 36:31.800]  Only good.
[36:34.840 --> 36:35.880]  Oh, yeah.
[36:35.880 --> 36:37.640]  Do this hole down here, Andrew.
[36:37.740 --> 36:38.700]  Don't try to go down there.
[36:38.800 --> 36:39.280]  You'll die.
[36:40.300 --> 36:40.740]  Okay.
[36:43.440 --> 36:44.300]  Where'd Nick go?
[36:45.620 --> 36:46.400]  Great question.
[36:46.540 --> 36:47.720]  I thought we're all going that way.
[36:50.280 --> 36:51.280]  Yeah, he's over here.
[36:54.400 --> 36:55.540]  Gunman somewhere nearby.
[36:55.980 --> 36:56.400]  What's up?
[36:57.440 --> 36:58.520]  Gunman somewhere nearby.
[36:58.740 --> 36:58.980]  Okay.
[37:02.040 --> 37:03.860]  He bounced into the cart and kept walking.
[37:07.140 --> 37:08.560]  Oh, that sounded bad.
[37:22.300 --> 37:23.680]  How's it going over there?
[37:37.830 --> 37:38.850]  Geoff is just...
[37:40.650 --> 37:43.090]  It's so funny.
[37:43.850 --> 37:44.230]  All right.
[37:44.330 --> 37:44.950]  There it is.
[37:46.790 --> 37:47.630]  There it is.
[37:48.450 --> 37:49.370]  How much do we need?
[37:49.450 --> 37:49.770]  15?
[37:50.950 --> 37:51.810]  Yeah, put it in.
[37:52.790 --> 37:53.670]  We'll get him back.
[37:54.610 --> 37:55.490]  And then we need to book it.
[37:56.350 --> 37:57.590]  Doesn't need to be in the cart, right?
[37:57.590 --> 37:58.510]  It could just be on the floor.
[37:58.590 --> 38:01.630]  Yeah, it can be on the floor.
[38:01.710 --> 38:01.970]  It's fine.
[38:02.250 --> 38:02.950]  Do you think Geoff's all right?
[38:04.350 --> 38:05.190]  I'm sure he's fine.
[38:05.450 --> 38:06.250]  Yeah, there he is.
[38:06.350 --> 38:06.610]  Hey, man.
[38:06.690 --> 38:07.110]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[38:09.690 --> 38:10.270]  Hey, they're back.
[38:10.330 --> 38:10.530]  What's up?
[38:10.570 --> 38:11.150]  Let's get out of here.
[38:11.290 --> 38:11.490]  Let's go.
[38:11.650 --> 38:12.110]  Great job.
[38:12.210 --> 38:12.650]  What's up, guys?
[38:12.650 --> 38:13.210]  That's GTF.
[38:13.470 --> 38:14.050]  Yeah, this way.
[38:21.820 --> 38:22.620]  What does the alien do?
[38:23.080 --> 38:23.520]  Don't know.
[38:30.540 --> 38:31.780]  Oh, it's still on me.
[38:35.740 --> 38:36.340]  Boys!
[38:37.520 --> 38:38.120]  Run!
[38:38.440 --> 38:38.800]  Run!
[38:39.120 --> 38:39.620]  Run!
[38:40.200 --> 38:41.640]  Blind gunman, run!
[38:51.740 --> 38:52.140]  Got it.
[38:52.480 --> 38:53.100]  He's right here.
[38:53.280 --> 38:53.620]  Oh, shit.
[38:58.760 --> 39:00.480]  He shot the duck.
[39:03.140 --> 39:04.900]  Are the others alive?
[39:05.620 --> 39:06.480]  I don't know.
[39:07.740 --> 39:08.840]  Eric screamed and ran.
[39:10.340 --> 39:11.700]  I don't see any heads.
[39:12.320 --> 39:12.660]  Oh, nope.
[39:12.660 --> 39:13.080]  There's a head.
[39:13.600 --> 39:14.340]  Oh, shit.
[39:14.900 --> 39:16.080]  Oh, shit, alien.
[39:16.520 --> 39:17.760]  Nick, behind you.
[39:20.100 --> 39:20.500]  Balls.
[39:24.280 --> 39:25.000]  Oh, there's Eric.
[39:25.140 --> 39:25.360]  Okay.
[39:25.540 --> 39:25.940]  Is that Geoff?
[39:26.200 --> 39:26.700]  Might be Geoff.
[39:26.920 --> 39:28.120]  I think it's Geoff.
[39:28.500 --> 39:28.940]  Where's Eric?
[39:35.050 --> 39:35.970]  I think we'll be okay.
[39:36.410 --> 39:36.850]  What was that?
[39:37.090 --> 39:37.630]  Are you coughing?
[39:37.930 --> 39:38.110]  Yeah.
[39:38.210 --> 39:39.150]  Oh, God, you scared me.
[39:39.170 --> 39:39.410]  Sorry.
[39:40.090 --> 39:40.670]  It's okay.
[39:41.890 --> 39:42.710]  Do you think Andrew's dead?
[39:45.090 --> 39:47.150]  I don't think so.
[39:47.150 --> 39:48.370]  Let's go up and over.
[39:51.830 --> 39:52.850]  Oh, shit, duck.
[39:53.950 --> 39:55.230]  The duck's on me.
[39:58.190 --> 39:59.490]  Can I look at it?
[40:00.130 --> 40:00.690]  Piss off.
[40:04.460 --> 40:05.160]  I don't want to.
[40:05.860 --> 40:06.700]  Hey, what's up?
[40:07.100 --> 40:07.620]  It's a duck.
[40:13.900 --> 40:15.220]  He's cute as shit.
[40:17.140 --> 40:18.260]  Let's just get out of here.
[40:19.260 --> 40:19.520]  Yeah.
[40:24.440 --> 40:25.340]  Yeah, but why not?
[40:26.380 --> 40:26.700]  There you go.
[40:27.160 --> 40:27.880]  There's Andrew.
[40:28.420 --> 40:29.020]  Where's Gavin?
[40:29.040 --> 40:29.940]  We did it.
[40:30.140 --> 40:30.940]  Oh, where's Gavin?
[40:31.200 --> 40:32.000]  He's somewhere back there.
[40:32.020 --> 40:32.740]  He was looking at the duck.
[40:46.010 --> 40:46.970]  He was just...
[40:46.970 --> 40:48.270]  He was walking right past me.
[40:49.190 --> 40:49.950]  All right, boys, come on in.
[40:50.270 --> 40:50.910]  Let's see what we did.
[40:51.030 --> 40:51.350]  We did it.
[40:51.570 --> 40:51.830]  Nice.
[40:52.090 --> 40:52.510]  Great job.
[40:54.750 --> 40:57.710]  And away we go.
[40:58.070 --> 40:58.530]  We did it, boys.
[40:58.610 --> 40:58.970]  Perfect.
[40:59.550 --> 41:00.650]  That was good progress.
[41:02.090 --> 41:02.490]  Way to go.
[41:02.570 --> 41:02.970]  So good.
[41:04.490 --> 41:04.890]  Wow.
[41:05.650 --> 41:08.170]  We'll be doing speed runs in this game before long.
[41:08.730 --> 41:09.430]  No joke.
[41:10.550 --> 41:13.150]  Well, guys, thanks for watching this repo.
[41:13.470 --> 41:16.370]  We're going to have more repo, I think, in the future because this is too good.
[41:16.510 --> 41:17.010]  So much fun.
[41:17.110 --> 41:19.890]  Yeah, we should continue this run because we're on level four.
[41:20.950 --> 41:21.050]  Yeah.
[41:21.070 --> 41:21.370]  Hell yeah.
[41:21.630 --> 41:21.970]  Yeah.
[41:22.490 --> 41:25.210]  I don't know how it works or what we need to do, but we're here.
[41:25.570 --> 41:26.330]  You did a great job.
[41:26.610 --> 41:27.990]  So congratulations, everyone.
[41:28.130 --> 41:28.710]  Good work, fellas.
[41:29.830 --> 41:30.630]  Great job.
[41:32.730 --> 41:33.130]  What?
[41:33.130 --> 41:34.550]  What happened?
[41:35.010 --> 41:35.410]  Yeah.
[41:35.450 --> 41:35.670]  Yeah.
[41:35.670 --> 41:36.090]  What's the matter?
[41:36.790 --> 41:37.250]  Why are you screaming?
[41:38.270 --> 41:39.170]  There's a landmine.
[41:39.310 --> 41:39.650]  Where?
[41:40.030 --> 41:40.850]  Oh, shit.
[41:40.930 --> 41:43.910]  Guys, go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[41:44.330 --> 41:44.850]  Check out...
[41:49.450 --> 41:51.210]  Check out the podcast.
[41:51.790 --> 41:52.850]  And we'll see you next time.
[41:53.110 --> 41:53.170]  Bye.
[41:57.710 --> 41:58.630]  They're dead.
[41:58.950 --> 41:59.630]  Oh, no.
[42:00.270 --> 42:01.690]  Bite, bite, burn.
[42:01.950 --> 42:04.390]  Uh, we might be restarting next time.
[42:04.450 --> 42:04.650]  Bye.
