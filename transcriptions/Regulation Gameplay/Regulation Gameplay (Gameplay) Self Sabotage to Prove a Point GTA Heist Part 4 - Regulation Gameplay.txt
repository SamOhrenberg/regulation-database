[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  Hello, and welcome to a Humane Labs raid part two that Gavin doesn't want to film, but we're here anyway
[00:04.720 --> 00:09.760]  What do you want to play GTA? What do you mean? I don't want to film. You were all, uh, we don't need to film
[00:09.760 --> 00:11.700]  We don't need, we don't need the video
[00:11.700 --> 00:17.040]  We don't need to film this now, but god damn do I want to play. Yeah, yeah, all right. Where are we going?
[00:17.460 --> 00:21.940]  We're stealing the Valkyrie. I'll put a, I'll put a marker down. You know the rules. I'll follow you guys.
[00:23.640 --> 00:25.460]  Gavin, there you go. The rules.
[00:29.040 --> 00:37.640]  Yeah, but he has a motor. I don't think, I think he's okay. It keeps flashing zero lives. Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah, we are on hard.
[00:38.840 --> 00:43.820]  Wow, it really is trying to remote. Oh my god. That was an accident, I think.
[00:43.860 --> 00:46.520]  That was his fault, but you know what? Holy shit. I'll take it.
[00:47.260 --> 00:49.880]  Can I put a waypoint marker down for you? Thank you very much.
[00:51.060 --> 00:53.940]  Excuse me, pardon. Oh, Gavin!
[00:55.680 --> 00:57.020]  You're being dangerous.
[00:57.760 --> 00:59.980]  I got a really good shot of that. That was pretty cool.
[01:00.080 --> 01:00.420]  I'm glad.
[01:02.020 --> 01:03.700]  Oh shit, that was incredible.
[01:04.420 --> 01:04.800]  Wow.
[01:05.340 --> 01:07.420]  What a, what an experience.
[01:08.540 --> 01:11.880]  Speaking of experience, I hear that Fly Me to the Moon is pretty good.
[01:11.980 --> 01:13.360]  I doubt it. What a film.
[01:13.480 --> 01:17.440]  Also, by the time this comes out, there's no way anyone's thinking about that movie.
[01:18.340 --> 01:20.660]  Oh shit, you're right. This is getting around months from now.
[01:21.660 --> 01:22.200]  Fuck.
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.320]  Is that the one with the, is that ScarJo?
[01:25.760 --> 01:27.060]  Yeah. It is.
[01:27.300 --> 01:28.140]  And Channing Tatum.
[01:28.920 --> 01:30.880]  Channing Tatum. Wow.
[01:31.880 --> 01:32.320]  Where's he been?
[01:34.640 --> 01:35.780]  Magic Mike, I guess.
[01:36.380 --> 01:37.920]  Oh yeah, they made a third one.
[01:37.940 --> 01:39.140]  Was he in the most recent Magic Mike?
[01:40.460 --> 01:42.060]  I don't know if he was.
[01:43.780 --> 01:49.180]  I feel like Magic Mike has the same trajectory, potentially, as the Scorpion King movies.
[01:49.180 --> 01:52.520]  Where by like, the fifth one, it's just gonna be Randy Couture.
[01:53.620 --> 01:57.620]  The Rock is not gonna be involved in any capacity, it's just all straight to DVD access.
[01:57.620 --> 01:58.860]  Do you think Randy Couture...
[01:58.860 --> 01:59.220]  Did you see his cock?
[02:00.640 --> 02:02.340]  What? No, it's not Ben Affleck.
[02:02.500 --> 02:03.240]  Did Magic Mike's cock come out?
[02:03.700 --> 02:06.640]  You don't see any hogs in that movie.
[02:08.620 --> 02:09.780]  I don't think, anyway.
[02:10.440 --> 02:12.200]  My wife was like, we need to watch this.
[02:13.020 --> 02:14.360]  They don't even show you the throat.
[02:14.560 --> 02:15.680]  They don't even show you the middle of it.
[02:16.380 --> 02:19.420]  Just a bunch of dudes who haven't seen Magic Mike.
[02:19.600 --> 02:20.500]  That's what we are.
[02:21.780 --> 02:25.240]  Four guys speculating on if there's dick in Magic Mike.
[02:26.180 --> 02:29.200]  How many animals are euphemisms for body parts?
[02:29.560 --> 02:32.120]  Hogs and dogs could be like, cock and feet.
[02:33.400 --> 02:35.160]  Wait, what? Well, cock also.
[02:35.600 --> 02:36.540]  Well, dogs are feet.
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.440]  Gotta let the dogs out.
[02:41.080 --> 02:41.940]  Gotta let the dogs out.
[02:41.940 --> 02:43.460]  He's taking his socks off, I guess.
[02:44.060 --> 02:44.720]  Sometimes the hog.
[02:47.220 --> 02:48.180]  Equipping mask.
[02:48.600 --> 02:49.840]  Equip the mask.
[02:50.100 --> 02:51.040]  Gavin, your mask is on.
[02:51.800 --> 02:52.240]  Is it on?
[02:52.740 --> 02:55.080]  Now, what are you doing?
[02:56.020 --> 02:56.420]  Nick!
[02:58.100 --> 02:59.060]  Jesus Christ.
[02:59.180 --> 02:59.640]  Oh my God.
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.840]  Why would you get out?
[03:04.120 --> 03:04.600]  You stupid fool.
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.080]  That is insane.
[03:07.160 --> 03:08.580]  I'm not with these guys.
[03:09.420 --> 03:10.780]  I'm not with these guys.
[03:11.700 --> 03:12.740]  Well, you sure are.
[03:13.240 --> 03:14.940]  Oh, Gavin, what a move.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.260]  Oh, I like it, Gavin. I like it.
[03:16.260 --> 03:17.900]  Whoa, Gavin, that was sick.
[03:18.160 --> 03:20.140]  I'm wondering if I could just land down on there.
[03:21.020 --> 03:22.340]  Give it a shot.
[03:22.760 --> 03:24.360]  That actually worked, kind of.
[03:25.100 --> 03:27.560]  Oh, you got it.
[03:28.000 --> 03:28.600]  Gavin died.
[03:30.900 --> 03:32.360]  Oh, there's a guy up here.
[03:32.620 --> 03:35.080]  Where I was more competent, that would have been so cool.
[03:35.240 --> 03:35.380]  Yeah.
[03:35.380 --> 03:35.680]  Wow.
[03:36.260 --> 03:37.640]  I mean, it looked cool.
[03:38.620 --> 03:39.880]  So we're going quiet, yeah?
[03:41.100 --> 03:42.920]  I don't know. Great question, Nick.
[03:43.400 --> 03:44.520]  I certainly am.
[03:44.900 --> 03:46.180]  Okay, alright.
[03:46.480 --> 03:47.120]  I get the memo.
[03:47.440 --> 03:51.620]  I was thinking about body part animals.
[03:51.660 --> 03:52.840]  You're thinking about hogs and dogs?
[03:53.360 --> 03:54.180]  Yeah, cocks.
[03:56.600 --> 03:58.160]  Are you team hog or team dog?
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.920]  A man can't get enough of his hogs and dogs.
[04:00.520 --> 04:02.140]  It depends on the day of the week, I suppose.
[04:03.880 --> 04:04.280]  Whoa.
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.240]  This does not look like we're going in quiet.
[04:07.020 --> 04:08.420]  Well, Gavin certainly does.
[04:08.520 --> 04:09.880]  Should I put my Widowmaker away?
[04:10.000 --> 04:10.880]  Yeah, if you could.
[04:11.780 --> 04:12.180]  Alright.
[04:13.520 --> 04:14.940]  I got a silenced pistol.
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.100]  I'm putting my gun away also.
[04:17.860 --> 04:19.240]  Well, this is silenced. It's fine.
[04:19.980 --> 04:21.720]  Let's make a move. Are we driving over there?
[04:21.740 --> 04:23.060]  I'm using my silenced vehicle.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.780]  I'm using my silenced vehicle to sneak in there.
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.880]  He's trying to pop the tire.
[04:34.200 --> 04:36.160]  I guess let's just keep moving.
[04:36.700 --> 04:37.900]  Should've drove over here.
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.660]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[04:40.640 --> 04:42.360]  We're quite a ways.
[04:42.640 --> 04:44.260]  Yeah, this doesn't feel close at all.
[04:44.820 --> 04:45.440]  Okay, I'm in.
[04:46.220 --> 04:48.220]  I'm being sneaky about it, but I'm in.
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.320]  I can hear by the alarm.
[04:51.000 --> 04:51.960]  Oh, I don't.
[04:52.220 --> 04:55.340]  Oh no, I went to nearly as sneaky as I thought I was being.
[04:55.980 --> 04:56.900]  Oh, you mean the loud...
[04:56.900 --> 04:57.660]  Oh no!
[04:58.740 --> 05:00.220]  Well, hey guys, I don't think it worked out.
[05:00.860 --> 05:02.200]  I'm just sticking together.
[05:02.460 --> 05:05.420]  Yeah, I'm with you. Should we just get in the one car that's there?
[05:06.200 --> 05:06.400]  Yeah.
[05:07.680 --> 05:08.320]  Alright, let's do it.
[05:08.320 --> 05:10.760]  Let's all get in the car, and then just blast
[05:10.760 --> 05:12.840]  all the way up to the helicopter, then get out.
[05:13.020 --> 05:13.540]  Yeah, I'm down.
[05:14.400 --> 05:15.120]  That's what we're doing.
[05:15.980 --> 05:17.180]  We're just gonna gun it.
[05:18.740 --> 05:20.880]  I'm sorry, what were you doing the first time?
[05:21.960 --> 05:22.880]  Running people over?
[05:23.680 --> 05:24.840]  On the way to the helicopter, yeah.
[05:24.840 --> 05:25.940]  I think that's fine.
[05:26.060 --> 05:28.380]  I think that alarm always goes off.
[05:28.520 --> 05:30.240]  I don't think there's a way to sneaky do it.
[05:30.520 --> 05:32.660]  I don't think running people over helped our case.
[05:32.960 --> 05:34.620]  I don't think it didn't help.
[05:35.220 --> 05:36.700]  Two less people to have to shoot.
[05:37.600 --> 05:38.320]  Alright, boys.
[05:38.760 --> 05:39.140]  We're in.
[05:40.100 --> 05:40.340]  Alright.
[05:42.340 --> 05:43.260]  What's the best route?
[05:43.980 --> 05:45.160]  Go straight in.
[05:45.800 --> 05:47.880]  We'll follow the GPS, alright?
[05:48.460 --> 05:51.260]  Oh, that was a cool...
[05:52.360 --> 05:53.600]  He stepped in front.
[05:54.120 --> 05:54.680]  Inevitable.
[05:55.140 --> 05:57.380]  He stepped in front, that's on him.
[05:58.340 --> 05:59.620]  Okay, left now.
[06:01.380 --> 06:02.120]  Just keep on going.
[06:03.500 --> 06:04.620]  Everybody shoot.
[06:04.840 --> 06:05.920]  I put my mask on.
[06:07.020 --> 06:07.940]  Why'd you stop?
[06:09.740 --> 06:12.620]  The gate is closed, you fucker!
[06:12.620 --> 06:14.840]  Drive through it, you fool!
[06:15.060 --> 06:16.120]  Yeah, dude, it's classic.
[06:16.340 --> 06:17.500]  Classic gate.
[06:18.540 --> 06:20.620]  Look at the size of the gate!
[06:20.620 --> 06:22.080]  I can't drive through it.
[06:23.300 --> 06:24.300]  Oh my god.
[06:24.320 --> 06:26.440]  Why did we hit the brakes in the middle of the heist?
[06:26.620 --> 06:27.880]  There was a stop sign.
[06:28.140 --> 06:30.060]  We have to obey the rules of the road.
[06:30.320 --> 06:31.180]  It's not breaking the law.
[06:31.780 --> 06:33.520]  I didn't hit the brakes that time.
[06:33.760 --> 06:34.620]  Can't hit a moving target.
[06:35.840 --> 06:37.520]  Why did you park here?
[06:37.700 --> 06:38.880]  Why are we stopped?
[06:40.580 --> 06:42.300]  Okay, well, we're all dead.
[06:42.740 --> 06:44.220]  Let's get out, let's get out. We'll hide over here.
[06:44.320 --> 06:44.900]  Hide behind the building.
[06:45.440 --> 06:45.980]  I'm dead.
[06:45.980 --> 06:47.940]  Oh, Jesus Christ!
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.200]  It's weird, it's weird.
[06:49.320 --> 06:52.860]  When we parked next to the guys shooting us, they kept shooting us.
[06:53.280 --> 06:54.500]  You know what, that part was on me.
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.880]  Was everyone shooting out the windows?
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.200]  Yes!
[06:57.440 --> 06:58.280]  No, I was not.
[06:59.040 --> 07:00.740]  Well, yeah, Nick, you focus on driving.
[07:01.140 --> 07:01.580]  I will.
[07:03.360 --> 07:04.360]  Andrew, what were you doing?
[07:04.900 --> 07:06.720]  I gave up on the run about halfway through.
[07:06.760 --> 07:08.780]  Once he stopped at the stop sign, I gave up.
[07:08.820 --> 07:09.740]  I don't blame you, dude.
[07:11.460 --> 07:14.040]  We're gonna drive into the closed thing, and we're gonna see what happens.
[07:14.040 --> 07:15.380]  And when it doesn't open,
[07:15.780 --> 07:18.100]  I'm gonna hear an apology from Eric.
[07:19.020 --> 07:19.500]  Eric?
[07:21.200 --> 07:23.720]  I feel like I'm leading the charge on that one.
[07:25.280 --> 07:26.740]  We clearly gotta go through the open one.
[07:26.920 --> 07:27.200]  Right.
[07:28.600 --> 07:29.480]  I don't know.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.940]  But what we're not gonna do?
[07:32.140 --> 07:34.000]  We're not gonna give up halfway through the run.
[07:34.200 --> 07:35.700]  Right. No matter what.
[07:36.300 --> 07:36.600]  Andrew.
[07:37.300 --> 07:38.600]  Fight to the end.
[07:38.680 --> 07:40.660]  I just was stunned by the stopping.
[07:40.660 --> 07:41.860]  Me too. The car's not there.
[07:42.040 --> 07:42.920]  The car's not here.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.120]  It's somewhere else.
[07:45.700 --> 07:46.400]  Oh, it's over there.
[07:48.140 --> 07:49.700]  I'm gonna ride a bike to go get it.
[07:50.840 --> 07:51.480]  It's over there.
[07:51.600 --> 07:52.800]  Oh, now you're a bike guy.
[07:52.920 --> 07:54.180]  No, just temporarily.
[07:56.880 --> 07:57.640]  She's got the tires.
[07:58.320 --> 07:59.580]  It's over here. It's over here on the main road.
[08:01.660 --> 08:01.840]  What?
[08:02.800 --> 08:03.960]  Where does Gavin go?
[08:04.260 --> 08:04.620]  Ow!
[08:05.960 --> 08:08.640]  I've somehow trapped myself in a kind of jail.
[08:08.640 --> 08:09.500]  Can you break me out?
[08:09.840 --> 08:13.100]  Guys, I trapped myself underneath the car.
[08:13.980 --> 08:14.760]  But I got out.
[08:14.880 --> 08:15.520]  You were trapped as well?
[08:15.820 --> 08:16.360]  I was.
[08:16.960 --> 08:18.520]  Nick, I need your car to free me.
[08:18.700 --> 08:19.240]  Okay, I'm coming.
[08:22.000 --> 08:23.520]  Andrew. Stop. Stop.
[08:23.600 --> 08:25.280]  Andrew. Stop.
[08:26.700 --> 08:27.380]  One second.
[08:28.500 --> 08:29.900]  Can we go get Gavin or what?
[08:30.360 --> 08:31.160]  Yeah, let's just go get him.
[08:32.360 --> 08:33.340]  I'm by the flare.
[08:34.940 --> 08:35.500]  Wrong way.
[08:35.960 --> 08:37.020]  Wait, are you under?
[08:37.420 --> 08:38.200]  Yes, he's under.
[08:39.840 --> 08:40.780]  Oh, I see. I see. I see.
[08:40.920 --> 08:42.380]  How did you just smash this fence?
[08:43.140 --> 08:44.620]  I don't know. Can you do that?
[08:47.060 --> 08:48.420]  Does it have a stop sign on it?
[08:51.280 --> 08:51.640]  Uh...
[08:52.620 --> 08:53.320]  Alright, Andrew.
[08:53.420 --> 08:55.500]  You drive to the side with the...
[08:56.100 --> 08:57.260]  Alright, there you go.
[08:57.380 --> 08:58.100]  How did you do that?
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.820]  I just drove into it.
[09:01.180 --> 09:02.020]  How did you do that?
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.320]  I just kept going forward.
[09:04.500 --> 09:04.840]  Wait.
[09:05.460 --> 09:07.340]  Andrew, I'm going to go on the side that's open.
[09:07.640 --> 09:09.620]  You go on the side that's closed.
[09:09.880 --> 09:10.780]  Yeah, of course.
[09:11.400 --> 09:13.500]  I just didn't think you could drive through fences like that.
[09:14.360 --> 09:15.880]  Yeah, I mean, there's...
[09:15.880 --> 09:17.400]  Listen, it didn't have a stop sign on it.
[09:17.560 --> 09:19.140]  Oh, you're right. You're right. You're right.
[09:19.380 --> 09:21.300]  Sorry. Sorry. I'm confused.
[09:25.440 --> 09:27.220]  These guys are getting clunked.
[09:27.280 --> 09:28.200]  Yep, they deserve it.
[09:29.520 --> 09:30.280]  Alright, Gavin.
[09:30.600 --> 09:31.860]  A little extra time.
[09:31.880 --> 09:33.640]  Thanks, Andrew Panton, for letting me die.
[09:34.580 --> 09:35.080]  Alright, here we go.
[09:35.800 --> 09:36.580]  A little bit of a plunk.
[09:37.200 --> 09:38.440]  Alright, let's go through the gate.
[09:39.400 --> 09:40.480]  Oh, look at that.
[09:40.740 --> 09:43.420]  Why did we do that?
[09:44.460 --> 09:45.360]  No, we did not.
[09:45.560 --> 09:47.660]  No, I'm proving a point.
[09:48.640 --> 09:49.340]  What a bunch of idiots.
[09:50.020 --> 09:52.000]  Why are you blocking me now?
[09:52.960 --> 09:54.540]  You've killed us, Andrew.
[09:54.820 --> 09:55.540]  You've killed us.
[09:55.540 --> 09:56.580]  I've killed us.
[09:56.780 --> 09:58.820]  You said you were going through the open one.
[09:58.960 --> 10:00.820]  And you told me to go through the closed one.
[10:01.160 --> 10:03.320]  I want to hear an apology for giving up halfway through that.
[10:04.240 --> 10:05.540]  I'm not even upset about
[10:05.540 --> 10:06.940]  these houses that I just created.
[10:07.520 --> 10:09.180]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[10:09.560 --> 10:09.980]  Hold on.
[10:12.160 --> 10:13.640]  Who needs to lie down?
[10:14.640 --> 10:16.340]  This is my favorite video game.
[10:18.120 --> 10:19.420]  Alright, we know the thing.
[10:19.600 --> 10:20.880]  I've proved my point.
[10:21.120 --> 10:21.820]  I feel better.
[10:21.820 --> 10:23.480]  Self-sabotage.
[10:23.600 --> 10:25.920]  It's self-sabotage to prove a point.
[10:26.380 --> 10:27.960]  And we all do it.
[10:28.660 --> 10:30.300]  That run was
[10:30.300 --> 10:31.820]  Hey, remember last time?
[10:33.260 --> 10:33.980]  No, but
[10:33.980 --> 10:35.700]  Andrew wasn't believing me.
[10:35.780 --> 10:36.700]  He did not believe.
[10:37.280 --> 10:37.600]  You're right.
[10:37.840 --> 10:40.200]  I care now.
[10:40.780 --> 10:41.520]  I don't care now.
[10:41.960 --> 10:44.260]  I don't care now.
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.740]  My potential cut is 38,000.
[10:46.860 --> 10:49.160]  I just spent 250,000 on ammo for this.
[10:49.160 --> 10:51.340]  Stop spending so much money
[10:51.340 --> 10:52.240]  on ammo.
[10:52.760 --> 10:54.120]  Let's go get my car.
[10:55.900 --> 10:56.860]  Oh, God.
[10:58.180 --> 10:58.660]  Alright.
[10:59.120 --> 11:00.560]  I've proven my point. I feel better.
[11:01.660 --> 11:05.060]  Okay, that did not work
[11:05.060 --> 11:06.800]  the way I thought it would. We're going back to them.
[11:07.300 --> 11:07.440]  Okay.
[11:08.200 --> 11:09.700]  You have to run over the bison.
[11:11.260 --> 11:11.560]  Oh, yeah.
[11:12.440 --> 11:13.400]  Oh, fuck!
[11:13.940 --> 11:16.140]  Alright, boys, get in.
[11:16.140 --> 11:16.700]  I'm dead.
[11:17.820 --> 11:18.480]  On our way.
[11:19.020 --> 11:21.500]  Wow, you tried to get in.
[11:21.840 --> 11:23.080]  Andrew's at half health already.
[11:24.340 --> 11:25.700]  I still have all my armor.
[11:25.860 --> 11:26.620]  P's and Q's.
[11:28.800 --> 11:29.920]  P's and Q's in the car.
[11:31.860 --> 11:33.260]  I think he's already firing.
[11:34.060 --> 11:36.000]  I'm just making sure I know what the fire button is.
[11:36.040 --> 11:37.600]  Try not to hit these guys and see what happens.
[11:38.120 --> 11:39.260]  Okay. Never mind.
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.680]  Nick, that one wasn't on you, bud.
[11:41.980 --> 11:43.280]  You know what? I accept
[11:44.120 --> 11:44.760]  No blame.
[11:44.820 --> 11:45.840]  I hit him with bullets.
[11:47.760 --> 11:48.360]  Let's go.
[11:48.660 --> 11:50.240]  Make sure you go through the one that's open.
[11:50.640 --> 11:51.580]  Hold on. We got it.
[11:51.640 --> 11:52.200]  We got it.
[11:54.700 --> 11:56.400]  Turn left there instead of right.
[11:57.320 --> 11:58.060]  We got it.
[11:58.840 --> 11:59.580]  Right into the car.
[12:01.100 --> 12:02.080]  Right into the wall.
[12:03.320 --> 12:04.280]  You'll have to pardon me.
[12:04.400 --> 12:06.000]  I was going over a speed bump of a gentleman.
[12:07.100 --> 12:08.100]  There was a stop sign.
[12:08.520 --> 12:09.840]  What was the speed bump's name?
[12:11.120 --> 12:12.420]  Why would you run into...
[12:12.420 --> 12:12.580]  Ow.
[12:13.020 --> 12:14.060]  I didn't run into anything.
[12:14.720 --> 12:16.480]  On my screen, you ran into the trailer.
[12:16.480 --> 12:18.240]  There's so many guys right by the helicopter.
[12:19.780 --> 12:20.560]  Focus fire.
[12:22.060 --> 12:23.880]  Alright. It's not letting me back up that way.
[12:25.480 --> 12:26.260]  Not sure why...
[12:26.260 --> 12:27.520]  Just keep us moving.
[12:27.700 --> 12:29.960]  What is shooting us from up there? Holy shit.
[12:30.140 --> 12:30.660]  I don't know.
[12:32.660 --> 12:33.100]  Alright.
[12:34.320 --> 12:36.140]  I'm getting us behind cover
[12:36.140 --> 12:37.360]  to get out of the vehicle.
[12:38.580 --> 12:38.900]  Alright.
[12:41.860 --> 12:42.620]  Someone's in the sea.
[12:42.820 --> 12:43.360]  Not me. I'm dead.
[12:47.750 --> 12:48.070]  Fuck.
[12:50.250 --> 12:52.190]  Any thoughts on any of that, guys?
[12:52.230 --> 12:53.550]  Nick is the man of the sky.
[12:53.650 --> 12:54.870]  I'm gonna be the guy of the road.
[12:54.990 --> 12:55.990]  Alright. Let's do it.
[12:57.150 --> 12:59.030]  I accept blame. That was bad driving.
[12:59.790 --> 13:00.310]  Who's driving?
[13:01.050 --> 13:02.730]  Nick. Oh, Andrew is? Alright, cool.
[13:02.850 --> 13:05.010]  This time, try not to hit those guys and see what happens.
[13:05.030 --> 13:06.010]  Hey, look. He went the wrong way.
[13:06.810 --> 13:07.750]  Yeah, get him, Nick.
[13:11.250 --> 13:11.650]  Where's...
[13:11.650 --> 13:12.810]  What are you doing, bud?
[13:13.430 --> 13:14.950]  I'm getting lined up.
[13:16.230 --> 13:18.010]  Alright, make sure...
[13:20.810 --> 13:22.710]  So, who was firing that time?
[13:22.850 --> 13:23.810]  Just curious. Nick.
[13:24.010 --> 13:25.270]  Okay, cool. So, when we said,
[13:25.630 --> 13:27.670]  come in here, don't fire, the...
[13:27.670 --> 13:28.390]  I killed that guy.
[13:29.550 --> 13:31.190]  Great. I killed that guy.
[13:31.390 --> 13:33.270]  It doesn't matter who we did and didn't kill.
[13:33.270 --> 13:34.530]  Right. Right.
[13:36.090 --> 13:39.410]  Way to go, Andrew. Good shit.
[13:40.210 --> 13:40.670]  See?
[13:41.230 --> 13:42.870]  Nice job. It's not that hard.
[13:43.250 --> 13:43.370]  Alright.
[13:44.890 --> 13:46.490]  Nick's just a man of the sky.
[13:46.810 --> 13:47.950]  Oh, no. I'm dead.
[13:48.250 --> 13:50.290]  What happened?
[13:50.630 --> 13:52.530]  I just got shot to death.
[13:52.890 --> 13:54.470]  Are you not buying armor between rounds?
[13:54.830 --> 13:57.050]  No, I buy armor. Maybe I didn't buy armor that...
[13:57.050 --> 13:58.050]  Maybe I forgot to buy armor.
[13:58.250 --> 13:59.970]  I just got lit up.
[14:03.270 --> 14:03.790]  Did you rip a ball?
[14:04.150 --> 14:07.350]  No, I was just very sarcastically
[14:07.350 --> 14:08.530]  taking a drink of coffee.
[14:08.810 --> 14:10.930]  Oh, man. I'm driving.
[14:11.270 --> 14:12.130]  What? You're driving?
[14:12.650 --> 14:14.690]  Yes. We're rotating every time. New rule.
[14:14.930 --> 14:16.910]  Okay. I like it. I love it. You drive.
[14:17.790 --> 14:19.010]  Okay. I love it.
[14:19.330 --> 14:21.150]  Are we shooting as we go in or not?
[14:21.710 --> 14:22.930]  Hell yeah. I don't think it matters.
[14:22.990 --> 14:23.350]  Yes?
[14:25.590 --> 14:27.430]  Alright. Alright, spaceman. Lead the way.
[14:27.850 --> 14:28.670]  Let's do it.
[14:34.880 --> 14:35.380]  Be careful.
[14:35.380 --> 14:36.400]  Be careful. They will shoot you, Gavin.
[14:36.820 --> 14:37.940]  Oh, that was a good spin.
[14:38.400 --> 14:39.200]  That was very nice.
[14:39.800 --> 14:41.720]  No, no. You're making the same mistake I made.
[14:41.920 --> 14:45.020]  Pardon me. We've all got to do that.
[14:46.280 --> 14:46.680]  Okay.
[14:47.180 --> 14:49.260]  This is where you look bad is this section.
[14:49.740 --> 14:50.160]  It's okay.
[14:51.220 --> 14:51.960]  That doesn't matter.
[14:52.660 --> 14:54.140]  Now is your time to shine.
[14:55.420 --> 14:55.720]  Nice.
[14:57.780 --> 14:59.260]  Got the bonus points for the guy.
[15:00.320 --> 15:01.020]  Ducking and weaving.
[15:01.220 --> 15:01.700]  Ducking and weaving.
[15:02.680 --> 15:03.500]  Spinning and weaving.
[15:03.800 --> 15:05.100]  Good weave. Good duck.
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.580]  I mean, we ducked.
[15:07.620 --> 15:09.620]  Alright, that guy is dead as dicks. We're trapped.
[15:10.440 --> 15:10.740]  Gavin?
[15:12.720 --> 15:14.520]  I'm getting thrown out of the car!
[15:14.840 --> 15:16.500]  I'm getting thrown out of the vehicle!
[15:17.380 --> 15:17.900]  No!
[15:18.240 --> 15:18.560]  No!
[15:19.700 --> 15:20.340]  I'm getting...
[15:20.340 --> 15:20.920]  No!
[15:23.800 --> 15:24.840]  Jesus Christ!
[15:27.120 --> 15:27.640]  Legitimately,
[15:27.780 --> 15:29.580]  one of the guys came up
[15:29.580 --> 15:32.620]  and threw me out and started beating me up.
[15:34.520 --> 15:35.000]  Gavin!
[15:36.440 --> 15:37.640]  And Eric's up.
[15:38.980 --> 15:39.680]  How was it?
[15:39.720 --> 15:42.260]  Did it look cool when we drove off, Andrew?
[15:42.480 --> 15:43.920]  Like, when you were on the ground.
[15:44.800 --> 15:46.500]  Was that neat to you?
[15:46.860 --> 15:47.280]  No.
[15:47.500 --> 15:49.280]  No, nothing about that looked cool.
[15:49.380 --> 15:50.100]  You didn't like that?
[15:50.900 --> 15:52.080]  No, it was all bad.
[15:52.080 --> 15:53.060]  I thought it was pretty cool.
[15:57.680 --> 16:00.320]  I was like, oh, someone's getting ripped from the vehicle.
[16:00.360 --> 16:02.620]  Oh, it's me! I'm getting ripped from the vehicle!
[16:03.880 --> 16:05.300]  Oh, the car is gone.
[16:06.240 --> 16:07.100]  Son of a...
[16:07.100 --> 16:07.720]  Oh my God.
[16:10.620 --> 16:12.280]  Alright, Eric.
[16:12.860 --> 16:14.160]  It's all the way on the other side, yeah?
[16:24.300 --> 16:25.600]  One, two, three.
[16:25.620 --> 16:26.820]  Why is my health so low?
[16:27.960 --> 16:29.300]  Am I coming to pick you up?
[16:29.360 --> 16:30.240]  Is that the plan, Gavin?
[16:31.040 --> 16:31.820]  I'm on the way.
[16:35.160 --> 16:36.380]  You're on the way?
[16:37.160 --> 16:38.120]  We were all on the way.
[16:38.420 --> 16:39.860]  No, I mean I'm on your way.
[16:42.460 --> 16:42.800]  Oh, what?
[16:43.720 --> 16:45.040]  What the fuck?
[16:45.200 --> 16:48.020]  What happened?
[16:49.020 --> 16:50.360]  Oh, Gavin was sniping!
[16:50.380 --> 16:52.180]  Oh, Gavin started sniping
[16:52.900 --> 16:53.820]  before we started.
[16:54.620 --> 16:55.340]  They're gone now.
[16:55.340 --> 16:56.660]  Oh, this worked really well.
[16:56.700 --> 16:58.300]  I don't think that helped us.
[16:59.180 --> 17:01.700]  Maybe this car did not swing out like it normally does.
[17:02.080 --> 17:03.500]  I think that was the car that...
[17:03.500 --> 17:05.480]  That was the car that came to us.
[17:05.500 --> 17:06.240]  Oh, that guy's dead.
[17:08.400 --> 17:09.280]  Alright, that guy's dead.
[17:11.220 --> 17:12.120]  Hey, he's driving!
[17:14.620 --> 17:15.340]  Doing good!
[17:15.760 --> 17:17.620]  Holy shit, that guy was so dead
[17:17.620 --> 17:18.680]  by the time we ran over him.
[17:19.680 --> 17:20.740]  I'm getting hit pretty hard.
[17:21.060 --> 17:22.740]  We killed him five times before he hit the ground.
[17:23.340 --> 17:23.780]  Nope.
[17:24.380 --> 17:26.980]  See? It sneaks up on you.
[17:27.080 --> 17:28.440]  It does. I agree with Nick.
[17:28.620 --> 17:29.580]  No, just jump out.
[17:30.520 --> 17:31.140]  I'm dead.
[17:32.440 --> 17:33.900]  So there's a...
[17:33.900 --> 17:36.160]  Shut the fuck up for a second.
[17:36.580 --> 17:38.240]  By the trailer
[17:38.240 --> 17:40.620]  where the gas tank is, there's a thing
[17:40.620 --> 17:42.700]  sticking out of the ground, a little yellow
[17:42.700 --> 17:44.500]  and black piece
[17:44.500 --> 17:46.060]  that you don't see
[17:46.060 --> 17:48.760]  when you're flying through. You have to get
[17:48.760 --> 17:50.860]  a little bit right of that or a little bit left
[17:50.860 --> 17:53.060]  and then I think you can swing around. I think you have to shoot a little bit
[17:53.060 --> 17:54.400]  left of it and then get around it.
[17:55.240 --> 17:57.040]  I think the car might be on the left
[17:57.040 --> 17:58.340]  side, so you might have to watch that.
[18:00.480 --> 18:02.180]  You might be able to sneak it to the right.
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.540]  I want to drive again. Yeah, go for it.
[18:04.540 --> 18:05.120]  You had a good run.
[18:06.260 --> 18:07.760]  I'm going to help Gavin snipe at the beginning.
[18:09.100 --> 18:09.420]  Why?
[18:10.040 --> 18:11.100]  Because that worked pretty well.
[18:11.980 --> 18:14.180]  It got rid of that car.
[18:14.700 --> 18:16.660]  There has to be another way to get in there.
[18:16.660 --> 18:17.820]  It's not one.
[18:19.300 --> 18:20.680]  Okay, I guess it's just me then.
[18:20.840 --> 18:21.900]  I'm just going to get in with you.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.240]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:24.320 --> 18:25.020]  Wait, wait, wait.
[18:25.360 --> 18:26.040]  Bye guys.
[18:28.080 --> 18:29.760]  Everyone got motorcycles and shit.
[18:30.260 --> 18:32.220]  No, that's not what I was trying to do.
[18:33.120 --> 18:33.360]  Well,
[18:34.580 --> 18:35.660]  he's dead. Eric, come back.
[18:36.120 --> 18:36.920]  Eric, come back.
[18:37.700 --> 18:38.260]  Come back.
[18:41.580 --> 18:42.300]  Oh, shit.
[18:44.860 --> 18:45.580]  I thought...
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.560]  Oh, Christ alive! This dude in this truck is shooting us.
[18:55.240 --> 18:56.680]  How you doing down there, Andrew?
[18:59.040 --> 19:01.380]  I'm living. I'm surviving.
[19:01.780 --> 19:02.760]  Oh, there's the chopper.
[19:03.080 --> 19:03.740]  There's the helicopter.
[19:05.780 --> 19:06.900]  I'm almost at the helicopter.
[19:07.080 --> 19:07.860]  Yeah, keep doing what you're doing.
[19:08.700 --> 19:09.580]  I'm doing it.
[19:13.260 --> 19:16.260]  I'm going to drop you, son of a bitch.
[19:17.940 --> 19:18.760]  Alright, here we go.
[19:18.920 --> 19:19.420]  Alright, great.
[19:20.440 --> 19:21.120]  Oh, he's dead.
[19:22.840 --> 19:23.240]  Post.
[19:23.820 --> 19:26.040]  I'm still making it.
[19:27.480 --> 19:28.280]  Almost there.
[19:30.060 --> 19:31.560]  I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[19:31.560 --> 19:32.040]  Oh, shit!
[19:32.480 --> 19:35.720]  I'm trying. I'm off the edge. I'm sorry, guys. Jump out.
[19:36.260 --> 19:39.300]  It's okay. Jump out. Take cover. Use cover.
[19:39.660 --> 19:40.680]  I'm going to get in the water.
[19:41.280 --> 19:42.420]  Oh, there we go.
[19:43.960 --> 19:44.880]  I'm taking out the helicopter.
[19:46.720 --> 19:47.780]  Hey, this is a great run.
[19:49.420 --> 19:50.840]  That's not sarcasm. I mean that for real.
[19:54.580 --> 19:55.280]  Oh, I see you.
[19:55.460 --> 19:56.560]  Okay, helicopter's almost down.
[19:58.260 --> 19:59.140]  Taking out the guys.
[20:00.660 --> 20:00.960]  Headshot.
[20:02.820 --> 20:03.620]  Left side, got it.
[20:04.240 --> 20:04.760]  Nick, get in the helicopter.
[20:05.040 --> 20:05.060]  Oh, shit.
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.760]  Watch, they're coming around your side. They're coming around your side.
[20:09.720 --> 20:10.520]  Nick, get in the helicopter.
[20:11.720 --> 20:12.160]  Helicopter's down.
[20:12.540 --> 20:13.420]  I'm going. I'm going.
[20:14.080 --> 20:14.840]  Should we all get in?
[20:14.960 --> 20:15.800]  Yeah, everyone get in.
[20:16.640 --> 20:16.940]  Shit.
[20:17.680 --> 20:18.340]  I'm on a gun.
[20:20.140 --> 20:20.780]  Come on, Andrew.
[20:21.480 --> 20:21.760]  Anyone?
[20:21.940 --> 20:22.700]  I'm in the water.
[20:23.160 --> 20:23.700]  Oh, fuck.
[20:24.020 --> 20:25.820]  Alright, well, have fun in the water. Let's go, guys.
[20:26.160 --> 20:26.780]  Time to go.
[20:29.440 --> 20:30.600]  Yeah, line them up.
[20:31.780 --> 20:33.200]  Where in the water? We gotta pick you up.
[20:33.320 --> 20:34.120]  Yeah, no we don't.
[20:34.220 --> 20:35.260]  I'm right next to it.
[20:35.480 --> 20:37.440]  No, we'll let him get to land and then we'll pick him up.
[20:39.300 --> 20:41.080]  Alright, destroy pursuing helicopters.
[20:42.580 --> 20:44.520]  Pick one, shoot down. Here we go, boys.
[20:45.740 --> 20:47.260]  Alright, where do you want me to go? Higher or what?
[20:47.900 --> 20:49.160]  Get up a little bit, yeah.
[20:50.440 --> 20:52.200]  That way we can shoot down at these guys.
[20:54.200 --> 20:56.500]  Pick one, let us know which one you're going. There's three of them.
[20:57.340 --> 20:58.120]  Left, middle, right.
[20:58.680 --> 20:59.360]  So you pick one.
[20:59.460 --> 21:01.180]  Yeah, I know. Maybe go right first.
[21:01.620 --> 21:02.300]  It's up to you.
[21:02.440 --> 21:02.780]  I can't tell the difference.
[21:02.780 --> 21:04.380]  I got left coming up fast.
[21:05.320 --> 21:05.560]  Okay.
[21:05.760 --> 21:06.760]  Left's coming up really fast.
[21:06.760 --> 21:08.480]  I'll just left one then. I'll do left one.
[21:14.670 --> 21:15.590]  Giving you an angle.
[21:15.950 --> 21:17.950]  Yep. Gavin, he's coming around to your backside.
[21:18.690 --> 21:19.910]  Sorry, I'm swinging to see...
[21:19.910 --> 21:20.730]  No, no, no. You're good.
[21:22.430 --> 21:24.570]  Got him. Come on. He's almost done. He's almost done.
[21:26.590 --> 21:26.950]  Alright.
[21:28.410 --> 21:28.950]  Come on.
[21:30.430 --> 21:31.150]  Come on.
[21:33.870 --> 21:35.350]  Gavin, can you see him out your back or no?
[21:36.070 --> 21:37.270]  Almost. Got him.
[21:38.170 --> 21:39.350]  Nope. Now he's back on you.
[21:39.350 --> 21:40.210]  Yep. Yep.
[21:40.290 --> 21:41.950]  Alright, I'm going to swing a little bit to give you more.
[21:42.090 --> 21:42.390]  No, you're good.
[21:45.370 --> 21:47.270]  I'm on. Go down. Your side, Gavin. Your side.
[21:49.290 --> 21:49.750]  See him.
[21:53.740 --> 21:54.920]  There. Got one. One down.
[21:55.420 --> 21:56.080]  Alright. Straight ahead.
[21:58.760 --> 21:59.360]  I see him.
[22:01.140 --> 22:01.860]  You guys okay?
[22:04.920 --> 22:05.520]  Yeah. We're good.
[22:05.740 --> 22:07.140]  We're just taking down attack helicopters.
[22:07.140 --> 22:07.760]  I think one of the guys inside is dead.
[22:08.540 --> 22:09.100]  Oh, wow.
[22:09.520 --> 22:11.040]  You just annihilated that guy.
[22:11.360 --> 22:11.900]  I shot the pilot.
[22:11.900 --> 22:12.240]  Oh, he's down.
[22:12.700 --> 22:13.460]  Nice. Good. There's one more.
[22:13.840 --> 22:14.560]  Your side, Gavin.
[22:15.000 --> 22:15.600]  Right here.
[22:20.840 --> 22:25.380]  Okay. We're alright. We're okay.
[22:25.680 --> 22:26.280]  Your side, Gavin.
[22:26.580 --> 22:27.360]  You sure about that?
[22:31.440 --> 22:32.200]  Light him up. Light him up.
[22:32.200 --> 22:33.320]  Still on you, Gavin. Your side.
[22:33.440 --> 22:34.100]  Light him up. Light him up.
[22:34.100 --> 22:34.420]  You got it.
[22:34.440 --> 22:35.380]  I'm still shooting the same guy.
[22:35.400 --> 22:37.280]  I know. I know. You got it. You got it. You're doing good.
[22:39.860 --> 22:40.420]  It's alright.
[22:42.240 --> 22:44.260]  You're doing good. You're doing good, Nick. Keep it up.
[22:46.160 --> 22:48.780]  It's so hard to shoot these things. It is tough.
[22:49.300 --> 22:50.740]  I'm going to spin it back to you, Eric.
[22:51.360 --> 22:51.680]  Yep.
[22:54.220 --> 22:54.940]  Going higher.
[22:55.200 --> 22:55.960]  Got him. Got him.
[22:56.040 --> 22:57.740]  Got him. Nice. There's another one coming.
[22:58.560 --> 23:00.280]  Nick, you don't happen to have missiles, do you?
[23:02.720 --> 23:03.120]  No.
[23:03.460 --> 23:04.260]  If you hit X?
[23:04.760 --> 23:05.620]  I just checked. I don't.
[23:05.820 --> 23:06.180]  Ah!
[23:06.300 --> 23:07.080]  Oh, shit.
[23:07.080 --> 23:08.580]  Direct hit. Gavin, your side.
[23:08.800 --> 23:09.180]  Oh, fuck.
[23:09.340 --> 23:09.780]  Oh, my side.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.140]  Eric, your side.
[23:11.260 --> 23:13.420]  I got him. I got him. One more. One more.
[23:13.960 --> 23:14.280]  Wait.
[23:14.380 --> 23:16.540]  We just got that one. We just got that one. There's one more coming.
[23:17.280 --> 23:18.400]  Alright, let's face him.
[23:20.480 --> 23:21.080]  Where is it?
[23:21.760 --> 23:22.860]  It's far out to the right.
[23:23.560 --> 23:23.700]  Okay.
[23:25.580 --> 23:26.940]  You want to go to him or what?
[23:26.940 --> 23:27.400]  There's Andrew down below.
[23:27.580 --> 23:29.780]  Andrew, do you have homing missiles by chance?
[23:30.160 --> 23:31.360]  Yeah, I'm here. I'm here to help.
[23:32.000 --> 23:32.660]  Should we pick him up?
[23:32.920 --> 23:33.100]  Yeah.
[23:33.620 --> 23:34.140]  Not yet.
[23:37.680 --> 23:38.300]  Do you see?
[23:38.540 --> 23:39.080]  The siren.
[23:40.720 --> 23:41.880]  He's coming up. I see him.
[23:42.160 --> 23:43.220]  Gavin, do you see him coming up dead ahead?
[23:43.620 --> 23:44.460]  I see him. I see him.
[23:48.340 --> 23:50.240]  We're pushing up to reconnect with you guys.
[23:51.780 --> 23:53.020]  Press Y to cool down your weapon.
[23:56.900 --> 23:57.400]  Oh, shit.
[23:59.900 --> 24:01.420]  Alright, I'm going to keep us moving forward.
[24:01.780 --> 24:02.940]  You're good. Just keep doing what you're doing.
[24:03.880 --> 24:04.940]  I'm just keeping an eye out.
[24:04.940 --> 24:05.560]  Whoop!
[24:07.060 --> 24:07.460]  Woohoo!
[24:08.180 --> 24:09.400]  Oh, he's shredding his business.
[24:10.700 --> 24:11.340]  He's dead.
[24:11.600 --> 24:12.480]  Yeah, there you go.
[24:12.820 --> 24:13.640]  A little bit of crossfire.
[24:13.820 --> 24:13.900]  Alright, cool.
[24:14.300 --> 24:15.500]  Oh, you got shit.
[24:15.820 --> 24:16.400]  Another one.
[24:17.240 --> 24:17.980]  Catch this.
[24:20.220 --> 24:21.800]  Are we going to pick up Andrew or what?
[24:22.040 --> 24:22.240]  Yeah.
[24:22.480 --> 24:22.680]  Yeah.
[24:24.580 --> 24:25.300]  Where are you, Andrew?
[24:25.320 --> 24:26.700]  On my way to you. Oh, I'm on the highway.
[24:26.960 --> 24:27.120]  Okay.
[24:28.780 --> 24:29.920]  Do you see our gunfire?
[24:30.040 --> 24:30.980]  Easy landing spot.
[24:32.720 --> 24:33.640]  Oh, I see it.
[24:33.640 --> 24:34.060]  Yeah!
[24:35.360 --> 24:36.340]  I see ya.
[24:37.380 --> 24:38.780]  Do you see my gunfire?
[24:40.160 --> 24:40.900]  Oh, shit.
[24:41.020 --> 24:41.700]  Oh, God!
[24:42.560 --> 24:43.540]  That almost killed us.
[24:43.640 --> 24:44.540]  Okay, we're all synced up.
[24:44.540 --> 24:46.260]  Are we picking him up or not?
[24:47.160 --> 24:48.300]  Yeah, we're picking him up.
[24:48.320 --> 24:51.380]  You're causing all the vehicles to speed down here and drive into me.
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.480]  Alright, nice and easy.
[24:56.860 --> 24:57.840]  Going right into the side.
[24:58.020 --> 24:59.260]  Going right into the freeway side.
[24:59.380 --> 25:00.300]  No, we're going over the side.
[25:02.900 --> 25:03.300]  Alright.
[25:04.040 --> 25:06.240]  Alright, we're keeping the freeways clear for you, Andrew. Get in!
[25:07.220 --> 25:07.860]  Oh, God!
[25:08.360 --> 25:08.580]  Oh, God!
[25:11.300 --> 25:12.080]  I'm on my way!
[25:14.000 --> 25:14.400]  Alright.
[25:14.700 --> 25:15.780]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!
[25:16.080 --> 25:16.960]  Come on, Andrew!
[25:17.220 --> 25:18.040]  Oh, my God!
[25:18.040 --> 25:18.640]  I'm on my way!
[25:18.860 --> 25:19.620]  Hell on Earth!
[25:20.560 --> 25:21.560]  Andrew, hurry up!
[25:21.600 --> 25:21.840]  Let's go!
[25:21.920 --> 25:22.620]  Up we go!
[25:23.320 --> 25:24.320]  Okay, let's go deliver this.
[25:24.460 --> 25:24.660]  Yeah!
[25:26.640 --> 25:27.420]  Right into a tree.
[25:28.480 --> 25:29.360]  Nope, above the tree.
[25:31.280 --> 25:32.440]  Bum-ba-da-ba!
[25:33.040 --> 25:34.220]  Oh, Andrew's on the camera.
[25:35.260 --> 25:37.320]  Oh, the thing that we could have had this whole time?
[25:38.160 --> 25:39.780]  Oh, is that like a missile gun?
[25:39.980 --> 25:40.340]  Probably.
[25:40.480 --> 25:41.920]  Like an explosive round gun?
[25:42.540 --> 25:42.740]  Cool.
[25:42.960 --> 25:43.420]  Oh, nice.
[25:43.580 --> 25:44.740]  We've both got on the shit guns now.
[25:44.940 --> 25:45.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:45.980 --> 25:47.620]  I can't believe we did that with those shitty guns on.
[25:47.760 --> 25:48.120]  That's great.
[25:48.760 --> 25:49.760]  Hey, great job, guys.
[25:52.260 --> 25:52.620]  Easy!
[25:54.360 --> 25:55.520]  Oh, are we going across the lake?
[25:55.660 --> 25:56.180]  Oh, we are.
[25:56.660 --> 25:57.240]  Looks like it.
[25:57.940 --> 25:58.900]  See that red flare?
[25:58.900 --> 25:59.800]  Sure do!
[26:07.390 --> 26:09.610]  I mean, you don't die if you land above water, right?
[26:11.410 --> 26:12.010]  Uh, you do.
[26:12.230 --> 26:12.530]  Good for it!
[26:17.570 --> 26:18.010]  Well...
[26:18.010 --> 26:18.230]  Eric?
[26:19.270 --> 26:20.590]  Don't wanna jump out!
[26:21.470 --> 26:23.070]  I don't want this to end!
[26:25.510 --> 26:29.170]  I made sure that I saw a parachute on Gavin's back before I hit the button.
[26:29.310 --> 26:33.890]  I was not willing to be the first person to do it, but as long as we had chutes...
[26:33.890 --> 26:35.290]  I'm just not...
[26:35.290 --> 26:36.650]  I'm sitting in the...
[26:36.650 --> 26:38.150]  I don't wanna leave the house.
[26:38.270 --> 26:38.710]  I'm good.
[26:38.990 --> 26:40.210]  I'm good right here.
[26:41.410 --> 26:44.670]  I could've gotten a bigger landing spot, if I'm being honest.
[26:45.030 --> 26:45.910]  You're doing great!
[26:48.390 --> 26:49.710]  Do you need to know where to land?
[26:50.230 --> 26:51.230]  No, I think I see it.
[26:52.450 --> 26:53.110]  Oh, thank you, Gavin.
[26:53.350 --> 26:53.570]  Ah!
[26:54.150 --> 26:55.250]  It's in the thing!
[26:55.530 --> 26:56.110]  It landed!
[26:56.610 --> 26:57.210]  Oh, sorry.
[27:00.270 --> 27:01.130]  Wow, that was cool.
[27:01.270 --> 27:01.650]  Nice shot.
[27:03.190 --> 27:04.910]  Oh, there's red everywhere!
[27:06.370 --> 27:06.830]  It's pretty tough.
[27:07.490 --> 27:08.550]  Oh, what a landing.
[27:08.830 --> 27:08.910]  Yeah!
[27:10.030 --> 27:11.990]  You missed it.
[27:13.890 --> 27:15.590]  It could've been a better landing.
[27:16.630 --> 27:17.530]  You guys have to move.
[27:18.570 --> 27:18.970]  There you go.
[27:20.070 --> 27:20.850]  Bloody hell.
[27:21.790 --> 27:22.670]  I thought Gavin died for a minute.
[27:22.690 --> 27:25.750]  Thank God that was an enclosed tail rotor.
[27:26.250 --> 27:29.130]  We would've chopped you to pieces otherwise, Gavin.
[27:31.650 --> 27:32.150]  Whip it!
[27:36.850 --> 27:37.590]  Checking out the heli...
[27:37.590 --> 27:38.210]  Nice!
[27:38.450 --> 27:39.010]  Look at us.
[27:40.490 --> 27:40.890]  Yeah!
[27:41.030 --> 27:42.010]  Give me that platinum!
[27:42.330 --> 27:44.010]  Wow, Gavin with the platinum!
[27:46.370 --> 27:48.470]  I think that was for my dive out at the end.
[27:49.210 --> 27:51.530]  I think it was for you hitting the helicopter with the flare.
[27:52.250 --> 27:53.030]  That was pretty cool.
[27:53.610 --> 27:54.430]  That was a good shot.
[27:54.570 --> 27:55.510]  That was a great shot.
[27:57.110 --> 27:58.430]  Oh my God, I'm sweating.
[27:58.650 --> 27:59.870]  What the...
[27:59.870 --> 28:02.290]  And now we got one more prep mission to do.
[28:02.290 --> 28:02.950]  Really?
[28:03.170 --> 28:04.110]  Just one more.
[28:04.210 --> 28:04.330]  Yep.
[28:04.530 --> 28:06.010]  And then, da iced.
[28:06.770 --> 28:07.690]  Da iced.
[28:09.930 --> 28:11.750]  You wanna have an arm wrestle, Eric?
[28:11.930 --> 28:12.950]  Oh wait, I need to get out of here.
[28:13.090 --> 28:15.030]  No, I want to play the next heist!
[28:15.050 --> 28:16.370]  You wanna wrestle this arms?
[28:16.570 --> 28:16.950]  No!
[28:25.250 --> 28:26.090]  Oh no!
[28:26.290 --> 28:27.270]  Oh boy!
[28:28.110 --> 28:28.590]  Fuck!
[28:32.150 --> 28:34.490]  Oh, Andrew Evil Knievel over here.
[28:36.110 --> 28:36.590]  Fuck!
[28:36.830 --> 28:37.550]  Oh shit!
[28:37.670 --> 28:38.470]  Way to go, man.
[28:38.470 --> 28:39.650]  Pretty cool stunts.
[28:41.010 --> 28:41.630]  Here, hang on.
[28:41.750 --> 28:42.970]  Let me be the camera for you.
[28:43.250 --> 28:43.630]  Alright, cool.
[28:44.030 --> 28:44.430]  Alright, whenever...
[28:44.430 --> 28:45.530]  You wanna do some stunts, Andrew?
[28:45.630 --> 28:45.950]  Go for it.
[28:47.090 --> 28:49.450]  We got some first person stuff going on.
[28:49.910 --> 28:50.630]  Stunt boy!
[28:59.910 --> 29:00.590]  Stunt boy!
[29:00.910 --> 29:01.570]  Go ahead, stunt boy.
[29:02.190 --> 29:04.090]  Look out for the motorhome, stunt boy!
[29:05.750 --> 29:06.450]  Stunt boy's about to...
[29:06.450 --> 29:07.070]  Can't catch me!
[29:07.070 --> 29:09.610]  Stunt boy's about to get his ass kicked.
[29:10.010 --> 29:10.930]  Oh shit!
[29:11.410 --> 29:11.890]  Stunt boy!
[29:12.210 --> 29:13.470]  Look out, stunt...
[29:13.470 --> 29:14.770]  Look out, stunt boy!
[29:15.210 --> 29:15.630]  Oh no!
[29:16.250 --> 29:17.630]  Why don't you like stunt boys?
[29:17.870 --> 29:19.190]  Oh, why don't you like stunt boys?
[29:19.230 --> 29:20.510]  Stunt boy, look out!
[29:21.090 --> 29:22.030]  Yeah, yeah!
[29:22.130 --> 29:23.110]  You scared...
[29:23.110 --> 29:24.230]  Get him, stunt boy, get him!
[29:24.490 --> 29:24.930]  ...radicalness!
[29:25.230 --> 29:26.210]  I'm going for him!
[29:26.950 --> 29:27.830]  Oh shit!
[29:28.270 --> 29:29.790]  Come on, stunt boy!
[29:30.370 --> 29:31.150]  Where is he?
[29:31.330 --> 29:32.110]  Where did he go?
[29:32.310 --> 29:33.030]  To the motorhome!
[29:33.090 --> 29:34.290]  There he is, he's running, he's getting away!
[29:35.130 --> 29:36.390]  No, no, no!
[29:37.070 --> 29:38.070]  Get him, stunt boy!
[29:38.830 --> 29:39.670]  Piece of shit!
[29:43.010 --> 29:44.910]  Oh, you ain't getting away from stunt boy!
[29:45.110 --> 29:46.070]  Have you killed stunt boy?
[29:46.710 --> 29:47.470]  Oh no!
[29:47.710 --> 29:49.490]  Stunt boy just got run over by a motorhome.
[29:51.910 --> 29:52.630]  Oh no.
[29:52.910 --> 29:52.950]  Fuck.
[29:54.670 --> 29:55.330]  Get him, stunt boy.
[29:56.610 --> 29:57.050]  Shit!
[29:57.510 --> 29:58.090]  Oh no!
[29:58.330 --> 29:58.730]  Oh no!
[29:59.270 --> 30:00.390]  We gotta fucking go!
[30:00.590 --> 30:01.290]  Eric, get on!
[30:01.450 --> 30:01.970]  We gotta go!
[30:02.190 --> 30:04.110]  There's no we, it's just you!
[30:04.150 --> 30:04.550]  Stunt boy!
[30:05.030 --> 30:06.030]  Oh no!
[30:06.030 --> 30:07.670]  I got hit by a car, stunt boy!
[30:10.010 --> 30:12.050]  How many people can get in this plane, Nick?
[30:14.050 --> 30:16.170]  Wait, Andrew, why don't I fly you?
[30:16.390 --> 30:16.890]  I got it.
[30:17.670 --> 30:17.990]  Okay.
[30:18.270 --> 30:19.530]  Rats away, let's do it boys.
[30:20.190 --> 30:20.730]  Aw, sweet.
[30:24.430 --> 30:26.550]  Stunt boy would like to present the motion picture.
[30:26.810 --> 30:28.250]  Fly me to the moon!
[30:32.310 --> 30:33.190]  And film...
[30:33.950 --> 30:34.950]  And films now.
[30:34.950 --> 30:36.010]  I hit the wrong button.
[30:36.610 --> 30:37.690]  And films now.
[30:40.150 --> 30:41.030]  What are you doing?
[30:42.090 --> 30:42.990]  Trying to get a new vehicle.
[30:43.490 --> 30:44.770]  Alright, it needs to be picked up in a helicopter.
[30:45.030 --> 30:45.210]  Me.
[30:45.790 --> 30:46.910]  Me and Andrew are at the airfield.
[30:47.790 --> 30:48.030]  Okay.
[30:48.770 --> 30:49.910]  The north airfield.
[30:50.330 --> 30:50.850]  Stunt boy!
[30:51.290 --> 30:51.570]  You fuck.
[30:51.970 --> 30:52.810]  You fuck.
[30:53.210 --> 30:53.890]  Stunt boy!
[30:54.890 --> 30:56.470]  Stunt boy lives by his own rules.
[30:56.810 --> 30:57.390]  Stunt boy!
[30:57.770 --> 30:58.150]  No!
[30:59.690 --> 31:00.410]  Stunt boy!
[31:00.410 --> 31:00.490]  Okay.
[31:03.370 --> 31:04.090]  Dude, it's...
[31:04.090 --> 31:06.510]  I think it's raining and thundering at my house.
[31:07.090 --> 31:11.890]  Yeah, I just received an alert that said lightning within some range of the airport or some shit.
[31:12.330 --> 31:13.090]  What, crazy.
[31:13.710 --> 31:14.490]  I know, I love it.
[31:14.510 --> 31:15.490]  That's why I did the lawn today.
[31:17.350 --> 31:18.710]  Gavin's gonna have a wet lawn tomorrow.
[31:19.530 --> 31:20.670]  Oh, it's the worst, Gavin.
[31:22.610 --> 31:23.650]  Oh, it's raining in the game.
[31:24.330 --> 31:25.190]  Wow, it's raining everywhere.
[31:25.210 --> 31:25.650]  I've never mowed it wet.
[31:26.030 --> 31:27.050]  I don't think you're supposed to, eh?
[31:27.350 --> 31:28.330]  No, it's bad for the grass.
[31:28.330 --> 31:29.410]  I mean, you can, it's just...
[31:29.410 --> 31:29.970]  Gross.
[31:30.370 --> 31:32.790]  It's also bad for the, uh...
[31:32.790 --> 31:33.290]  The blade.
[31:34.390 --> 31:35.850]  Alright, I'm dropping...
[31:35.850 --> 31:38.010]  I'm dropping a pin where we gotta go.
[31:38.370 --> 31:38.850]  Boom, baby.
[31:39.330 --> 31:39.890]  Oh, it's far.
[31:40.930 --> 31:42.330]  Right into the other car!
[31:42.390 --> 31:42.990]  Way to go, Nick.
[31:43.390 --> 31:44.350]  Sorry, I was looking at the map.
[31:50.350 --> 31:50.950]  This way!
[31:51.190 --> 31:53.470]  When you drop pins down, you don't see them, do you?
[31:53.950 --> 31:54.390]  What do you mean?
[31:54.950 --> 31:56.430]  I see them when you're in the car with me.
[31:57.030 --> 31:57.170]  Yeah.
[31:57.430 --> 31:57.490]  Okay.
[31:58.490 --> 31:58.690]  Okay.
[31:59.190 --> 32:00.850]  That's, that's why, that's why I do it.
[32:00.870 --> 32:01.170]  Whoa!
[32:02.510 --> 32:04.170]  Well, then I don't know why he was looking at the map.
[32:04.470 --> 32:06.050]  I, I, I mean, neither do I.
[32:06.190 --> 32:07.130]  I just wasn't gonna say anything.
[32:07.130 --> 32:09.030]  No, I was looking in the bottom left map.
[32:09.410 --> 32:10.010]  The little...
[32:10.010 --> 32:10.450]  Oh.
[32:11.110 --> 32:11.310]  Oh.
[32:11.450 --> 32:12.090]  Next to the car?
[32:12.310 --> 32:13.790]  So, the thing that was...
[32:13.790 --> 32:14.210]  No.
[32:14.410 --> 32:15.630]  One-ninth of the screen...
[32:16.270 --> 32:17.510]  You're just looking at your screen, is what you're saying.
[32:17.730 --> 32:18.090]  I...
[32:19.650 --> 32:20.770]  My contact was also...
[32:20.770 --> 32:21.510]  Maybe you shouldn't have told us that.
[32:21.510 --> 32:23.370]  I had to squint, and, um...
[32:23.370 --> 32:24.630]  You had to squint?!
[32:25.490 --> 32:25.950]  Yeah, man.
[32:26.050 --> 32:27.370]  And there was like a spider on the screen?
[32:27.530 --> 32:28.290]  Yeah, there was a spider.
[32:28.830 --> 32:31.450]  And then, and then I heard a bee buzzing around my office.
[32:31.450 --> 32:32.470]  There was a...
[32:32.470 --> 32:34.050]  There was thunder and lightning?
[32:35.010 --> 32:35.450]  You know what my...
[32:35.990 --> 32:36.450]  Can I...
[32:36.450 --> 32:39.870]  My kid, this thing that he does now, where like he hurts you, it's like,
[32:39.950 --> 32:40.790]  Ow, dude, that hurt.
[32:40.890 --> 32:42.210]  He's like, you hurt me.
[32:42.970 --> 32:43.070]  What?
[32:43.190 --> 32:43.450]  What?
[32:45.270 --> 32:49.970]  He does not take responsibility, and then he points you out as the guy who did it to him.
[32:51.210 --> 32:52.430]  Classic, yeah, but...
[32:52.430 --> 32:52.670]  Yeah.
[32:54.590 --> 32:56.450]  I mean, he's learning that you can get away with it.
[32:56.490 --> 32:57.010]  That's pretty cool.
[32:57.490 --> 32:57.730]  Yeah.
[32:58.490 --> 32:59.590]  Wow, what a stunt.
[32:59.750 --> 33:00.230]  Stunt boy!
[33:00.790 --> 33:01.390]  Stunt boy!
[33:01.570 --> 33:01.950]  Stunt boy!
[33:02.330 --> 33:03.290]  We're stunt boys.
[33:04.390 --> 33:04.810]  Ow.
[33:05.550 --> 33:05.970]  Goddamnit.
[33:07.370 --> 33:10.390]  Yeah, this one's for the dogs and the hogs right here, you can tell.
[33:10.890 --> 33:12.090]  Oh, we're hogging it up.
[33:13.130 --> 33:14.330]  Why did the guy do that?
[33:15.370 --> 33:16.470]  He died, I think.
[33:17.910 --> 33:21.510]  He killed himself if he did, because he just drove right into us.
[33:22.230 --> 33:23.370]  Hold Y for windshield wipers.
[33:26.730 --> 33:28.390]  I really thought he was gonna...
[33:30.630 --> 33:33.270]  This is a plot vehicle, Nick, just so you know.
[33:33.450 --> 33:33.570]  Yeah.
[33:33.590 --> 33:35.410]  We cannot use a different vehicle.
[33:35.630 --> 33:36.230]  You need to...
[33:36.890 --> 33:37.670]  This is it.
[33:38.370 --> 33:39.070]  If this...
[33:39.070 --> 33:39.490]  It's dead.
[33:39.490 --> 33:40.650]  Turn it over, come on.
[33:40.730 --> 33:41.190]  It's dead.
[33:41.910 --> 33:43.250]  The door has fallen off.
[33:43.430 --> 33:43.990]  It's dead.
[33:44.290 --> 33:44.830]  The car's dead.
[33:45.170 --> 33:46.750]  Is Nick not in the car?
[33:47.210 --> 33:48.570]  Guys, the car is dead.
[33:49.250 --> 33:51.030]  It's the insurgent, it's not the crewman.
[33:51.170 --> 33:51.410]  Yeah.
[33:52.270 --> 33:52.770]  Get any car.
[33:52.930 --> 33:53.170]  Right.
[33:54.490 --> 33:56.730]  I thought it was telling us to get in your car.
[33:57.330 --> 33:57.950]  Oh, no, no, no.
[34:01.390 --> 34:02.410]  My bad on that.
[34:02.490 --> 34:05.150]  But also, we landed just right in the river to where...
[34:05.610 --> 34:07.990]  Don't try to make something better of this.
[34:08.130 --> 34:08.330]  You just...
[34:09.770 --> 34:10.370]  That's bad.
[34:10.590 --> 34:11.310]  Hop in, boys.
[34:11.670 --> 34:12.110]  What happened?
[34:12.390 --> 34:13.090]  Oh, shit.
[34:13.250 --> 34:13.590]  Look out.
[34:13.790 --> 34:15.110]  Okay, I thought he was gonna hit us.
[34:15.830 --> 34:16.370]  Wow, nice job.
[34:16.390 --> 34:16.970]  Tips on trunk.
[34:18.030 --> 34:20.410]  You can put me in the trunk and just kill me.
[34:20.630 --> 34:21.190]  Alright, here we go.
[34:21.930 --> 34:22.670]  I'm putting my mask on.
[34:22.810 --> 34:23.250]  That was...
[34:23.250 --> 34:24.910]  That wasn't even funny, Nick.
[34:24.930 --> 34:25.830]  That was just sad.
[34:26.090 --> 34:28.490]  Yeah, because I drove like shit and I feel bad about it.
[34:28.930 --> 34:29.650]  Oh, I see.
[34:29.650 --> 34:29.890]  Okay.
[34:30.090 --> 34:30.510]  Yeah.
[34:30.530 --> 34:32.190]  I didn't understand the context.
[34:32.310 --> 34:33.570]  Not like real life.
[34:33.710 --> 34:34.390]  Just a general statement.
[34:34.830 --> 34:35.290]  Where are you going?
[34:35.290 --> 34:35.730]  There we go.
[34:35.950 --> 34:36.570]  Where are you going?
[34:36.670 --> 34:38.090]  To the insurgent.
[34:39.330 --> 34:40.850]  Well, certainly this isn't the way.
[34:42.210 --> 34:44.610]  We're off-roading in like a Honda Accord.
[34:45.970 --> 34:47.790]  Where we're going, we need roads.
[34:52.030 --> 34:53.050]  Doc, where are we going?
[34:55.110 --> 34:56.890]  I feel better about my driving now.
[34:57.070 --> 34:58.050]  Yeah, no, no, you're fine.
[34:58.130 --> 34:58.890]  It's just, you know...
[34:58.890 --> 34:59.630]  That was a shortcut.
[35:01.350 --> 35:01.790]  Okay.
[35:02.090 --> 35:03.610]  That's what I thought about mine.
[35:05.750 --> 35:06.850]  And they were at first.
[35:11.430 --> 35:14.510]  It's so dark in my office right now because it's so dark out.
[35:14.550 --> 35:15.730]  It is raining so hard.
[35:16.430 --> 35:19.470]  It was not in the forecast that it was raining today at all.
[35:19.690 --> 35:19.730]  Oh.
[35:19.790 --> 35:21.790]  You're getting full immersion because it's raining in the game.
[35:22.030 --> 35:25.510]  My thing said after like two we could get thunderstorms.
[35:25.570 --> 35:27.290]  I had partly sunny all day.
[35:29.490 --> 35:30.990]  Oh, dear God!
[35:31.310 --> 35:31.870]  He saw too much.
[35:34.650 --> 35:35.810]  We're going in stealth.
[35:35.970 --> 35:36.910]  Alright, next thing, kill this farmer.
[35:37.410 --> 35:37.890]  No witnesses.
[35:37.890 --> 35:39.030]  Cruising with the players.
[35:39.770 --> 35:40.570]  Plus 200.
[35:40.910 --> 35:41.370]  Yeah, buddy.
[35:42.770 --> 35:43.110]  Whoops.
[35:44.570 --> 35:44.970]  Shortcut.
[35:45.170 --> 35:47.370]  I think a heist takes us to this car park at some point.
[35:48.990 --> 35:50.370]  Let's try that point right now.
[35:51.050 --> 35:51.290]  Not this one.
[35:51.290 --> 35:52.150]  Yeah, we're on the boonies, bud.
[35:53.410 --> 35:57.950]  Hey, do you think that guy could make it a little easier for us by putting the thing somewhere closer?
[36:00.590 --> 36:01.010]  Could've.
[36:01.570 --> 36:08.030]  It wouldn't be Grand Theft Auto if you weren't just driving in the car for no reason so far.
[36:10.130 --> 36:13.790]  Look, this would've been a lot easier if you didn't blow up my helicopter, right?
[36:13.870 --> 36:14.690]  We'd be flying there.
[36:17.990 --> 36:19.510]  I didn't blow up your helicopter.
[36:19.510 --> 36:22.230]  I killed you, and then the helicopter fell.
[36:22.690 --> 36:24.430]  Oh, sorry, gravity blew up my helicopter.
[36:24.590 --> 36:25.250]  Yeah, see, there you go.
[36:26.070 --> 36:27.670]  And my dead hands at the stick.
[36:30.290 --> 36:32.310]  Unbelievable how hard it is raining outside.
[36:32.670 --> 36:33.210]  It's crazy.
[36:37.250 --> 36:39.050]  It's very slippery on this road.
[36:39.250 --> 36:41.170]  Everything Achievement Hunter told me about you is right.
[36:42.790 --> 36:43.850]  Wait, what did they tell you?
[36:44.730 --> 36:45.710]  Mostly this stuff.
[36:45.950 --> 36:48.550]  I think it was... yeah, just the whole thing.
[36:48.550 --> 36:51.090]  Alright, well, I'll see you there.
[36:51.170 --> 36:52.370]  Alright, Nick's gonna get there on his own.
[36:53.150 --> 36:53.690]  Oh, okay.
[36:53.890 --> 36:54.550]  Well, the car's not running, is it?
[36:54.550 --> 36:55.530]  I feel like we'll still beat him.
[36:55.890 --> 36:57.570]  Yeah, no, me too, but, you know, we'll see.
[36:58.590 --> 36:59.370]  I found a boat.
[37:00.870 --> 37:01.230]  What?
[37:01.290 --> 37:02.170]  I don't think that'll help you.
[37:02.730 --> 37:03.510]  I didn't, really.
[37:04.350 --> 37:04.750]  Oh, cool.
[37:05.270 --> 37:05.630]  Okay.
[37:06.670 --> 37:08.510]  Those are really low stakes lie by you.
[37:10.170 --> 37:11.890]  He's gonna come back around and find us.
[37:12.190 --> 37:13.690]  He's, like, so close to us.
[37:16.730 --> 37:17.590]  Oh, that's done it.
[37:17.590 --> 37:18.410]  Oh, Gavin.
[37:20.010 --> 37:21.790]  Why am I... why'd my health go low?
[37:22.910 --> 37:25.610]  Okay, I'm now... I'm now on Team Nick.
[37:26.690 --> 37:27.370]  Hey, what's up?
[37:27.390 --> 37:28.670]  Alright, Nick, where's that boat you found?
[37:29.990 --> 37:31.130]  Well, here's the thing.
[37:31.150 --> 37:31.830]  That room in the kayak?
[37:31.930 --> 37:32.390]  It was beached.
[37:34.070 --> 37:35.050]  But not by me.
[37:38.250 --> 37:40.470]  Just running in the rain by the sea.
[37:41.550 --> 37:42.730]  They said stealth.
[37:43.870 --> 37:46.090]  It doesn't get much more stealthy than this.
[37:48.490 --> 37:49.270]  How you doing, Gavin?
[37:51.070 --> 37:51.830]  I'm just driving.
[37:52.510 --> 37:53.130]  You're driving?
[37:54.190 --> 37:55.330]  Yeah, you guys want a lift?
[37:55.670 --> 37:56.110]  That'd be great.
[37:56.570 --> 37:56.910]  Yeah, sure.
[37:57.330 --> 37:58.530]  Oh, I'm falling down a mountain, boys.
[37:59.070 --> 37:59.470]  Oh, boy.
[37:59.750 --> 38:00.390]  I think I'm almost there.
[38:00.610 --> 38:01.890]  Skyrim it, Eric. You gotta skyrim it.
[38:01.990 --> 38:02.510]  I'm trying.
[38:04.070 --> 38:05.530]  I think I went the wrong way to skyrim it.
[38:05.690 --> 38:05.990]  Gavin!
[38:06.210 --> 38:06.830]  Hey, what's up, Nick?
[38:07.030 --> 38:07.310]  Hey, man.
[38:07.870 --> 38:09.110]  I thought we were taking a... alright.
[38:10.210 --> 38:10.650]  Oh, I see.
[38:10.750 --> 38:11.130]  Hold on, I'll be right back.
[38:11.270 --> 38:11.630]  Oh, okay.
[38:12.550 --> 38:12.870]  Why?
[38:13.510 --> 38:13.830]  Why?
[38:14.610 --> 38:15.230]  Hop in, son.
[38:16.010 --> 38:16.650]  Just why?
[38:16.650 --> 38:17.650]  Just why?
[38:20.050 --> 38:20.750]  Oh, that's hot.
[38:21.070 --> 38:21.850]  Oh, that's hot.
[38:24.070 --> 38:25.610]  Oh, my God, in heaven!
[38:26.090 --> 38:26.610]  There's no...
[38:27.870 --> 38:30.890]  Hey, thanks, Gavin.
[38:34.330 --> 38:35.150]  Let's get Eric.
[38:35.390 --> 38:35.790]  I'm coming.
[38:36.770 --> 38:37.750]  Oh, I see you guys.
[38:38.990 --> 38:39.510]  Hop in, son.
[38:43.950 --> 38:44.230]  What?
[38:45.130 --> 38:46.830]  He didn't get in, Gavin. He didn't get in.
[38:47.690 --> 38:48.070]  Gavin!
[38:49.050 --> 38:50.950]  You're gonna kill me and we're gonna have to start over.
[38:51.750 --> 38:52.690]  Can you get in the car?
[38:53.450 --> 38:54.070]  I'm trying.
[38:54.250 --> 38:54.710]  There you go.
[38:55.030 --> 38:55.990]  There we go.
[38:56.630 --> 38:58.150]  I mean, that's kind of on your guy, too, Eric.
[38:58.250 --> 38:59.290]  You could've gotten in at any time.
[38:59.490 --> 39:00.270]  I disagree.
[39:00.950 --> 39:01.750]  There's the insurgent!
[39:01.830 --> 39:01.990]  Don't!
[39:02.490 --> 39:03.150]  There you go.
[39:03.330 --> 39:03.830]  Alright, let's go.
[39:04.730 --> 39:05.010]  Ow.
[39:05.630 --> 39:07.090]  I need you guys to get in here.
[39:07.290 --> 39:07.970]  Okay, we're coming.
[39:09.190 --> 39:10.150]  Oh, I wanna get in the back.
[39:12.470 --> 39:13.950]  I don't care where I get in.
[39:14.550 --> 39:15.170]  I didn't either.
[39:15.710 --> 39:16.070]  Gavin.
[39:16.150 --> 39:17.050]  Just get in, Gavin.
[39:17.050 --> 39:17.510]  Gavin.
[39:18.710 --> 39:19.730]  Not the back back.
[39:20.330 --> 39:20.490]  Okay.
[39:20.690 --> 39:21.530]  It's the back that worked.
[39:21.690 --> 39:22.650]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[39:22.970 --> 39:23.330]  Alright, let's go.
[39:26.050 --> 39:27.710]  Oh, is this actually the final?
[39:27.730 --> 39:27.890]  Yeah.
[39:29.250 --> 39:29.610]  No.
[39:30.930 --> 39:37.270]  Essentially, you're gonna take this thing, like, straight east, a little south on the freeway, and we're, like, there.
[39:37.330 --> 39:38.010]  It's pretty close.
[39:38.830 --> 39:41.010]  Is there, like, a disco going on in the back of this thing?
[39:41.130 --> 39:41.770]  Oh, it's an EMP.
[39:42.250 --> 39:42.910]  It's an EMP.
[39:43.410 --> 39:44.150]  That's why I couldn't get in.
[39:47.450 --> 39:48.610]  EMPs look like a disco?
[39:49.510 --> 39:53.090]  Looks like we got a fuckin' Spencer's Gift thing in the back.
[39:53.730 --> 39:55.010]  The last disco you'll ever go to.
[39:56.710 --> 39:58.570]  The last disco your watch will ever go to.
[39:58.630 --> 39:59.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:59.650 --> 40:00.870]  Your phone, your watch.
[40:01.930 --> 40:02.430]  Oh, shit.
[40:02.550 --> 40:03.230]  Oh, balls.
[40:03.410 --> 40:04.830]  We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.
[40:07.130 --> 40:08.030]  Yeah, I did it!
[40:08.990 --> 40:11.110]  Why? What happened? Why did you do that?
[40:11.630 --> 40:12.070]  Oh, no.
[40:12.070 --> 40:12.810]  I didn't mean to.
[40:13.510 --> 40:14.530]  That was not on purpose.
[40:14.530 --> 40:16.110]  I don't know about that.
[40:16.190 --> 40:17.030]  I think you did it on purpose.
[40:17.870 --> 40:20.530]  I gunned it on purpose, but immediately hit a rock.
[40:20.950 --> 40:23.190]  And, uh, said it's flying.
[40:23.610 --> 40:24.310]  Clear a path!
[40:25.390 --> 40:25.830]  Stunt boy.
[40:27.070 --> 40:28.750]  Remember this is a stealth mission, right?
[40:29.310 --> 40:31.050]  I'm not sure if you guys remember that.
[40:31.230 --> 40:32.430]  Yeah, we're not at the stealth part yet.
[40:33.190 --> 40:34.510]  We're not at the stealth part?
[40:34.530 --> 40:35.050]  That comes later.
[40:35.350 --> 40:35.870]  Oh, no, yeah.
[40:35.990 --> 40:36.430]  That comes later.
[40:36.790 --> 40:37.570]  We have to get to the labs.
[40:38.790 --> 40:41.810]  Yeah, once we get there, then it's all stealthy boy time.
[40:45.150 --> 40:46.950]  Stunt boy doesn't talk to stealthy boy.
[40:47.410 --> 40:47.610]  Yeah.
[40:47.610 --> 40:48.690]  Oh, the sun's gone in.
[40:48.930 --> 40:49.550]  They're estranged.
[40:52.890 --> 40:55.550]  Well, that was actually a beneficial sign.
[40:56.070 --> 40:59.590]  Gavin, is it not sunny where you are now?
[41:00.530 --> 41:01.350]  Not as sunny.
[41:01.670 --> 41:02.790]  I think I might be about to get it.
[41:06.360 --> 41:06.780]  Hey.
[41:07.720 --> 41:07.920]  Hey.
[41:09.700 --> 41:10.140]  Shortcut!
[41:11.200 --> 41:11.740]  Very nice.
[41:11.740 --> 41:12.900]  That was cool as shit, actually.
[41:13.200 --> 41:13.880]  Very cool.
[41:16.420 --> 41:17.100]  Oh, balls.
[41:17.260 --> 41:17.660]  Oh, balls.
[41:17.820 --> 41:18.100]  Oh!
[41:19.340 --> 41:19.960]  It's fine.
[41:20.360 --> 41:22.440]  That was less cool, but I still liked it.
[41:22.660 --> 41:22.860]  Yeah.
[41:24.180 --> 41:25.720]  Really sent a message to that fence.
[41:28.380 --> 41:29.160]  Through the mountains!
[41:30.740 --> 41:31.720]  Yeah, it was, right?
[41:36.990 --> 41:39.890]  I see we're going to drop down, and they're not going to expect it.
[41:40.390 --> 41:41.570]  Prisoner of the players, 200 RP.
[41:41.830 --> 41:42.150]  Hell yeah.
[41:43.310 --> 41:44.830]  We're going to land on a monkey cage.
[41:45.250 --> 41:48.530]  I see this is front-wheel drive and not all-wheel.
[41:51.230 --> 41:52.470]  Yeah, no, we got to...
[41:53.030 --> 41:53.470]  Grippage.
[41:54.630 --> 41:55.070]  Grippage!
[41:55.490 --> 41:57.690]  There we go.
[41:57.890 --> 41:58.290]  Lovely.
[41:58.930 --> 41:59.370]  Wonderful.
[41:59.750 --> 42:00.170]  Beautiful.
[42:00.490 --> 42:01.450]  Nice and slow.
[42:01.630 --> 42:02.690]  Slow and steady.
[42:03.090 --> 42:03.930]  Oh, God.
[42:05.270 --> 42:05.710]  Oh, nice.
[42:05.850 --> 42:05.950]  Yay.
[42:06.610 --> 42:07.950]  Okay, now it's stealth time.
[42:09.270 --> 42:10.230]  Put your stealth hat on.
[42:12.630 --> 42:13.510]  I mean...
[42:13.510 --> 42:15.470]  You just got to park in that yellow, buddy.
[42:16.370 --> 42:17.050]  Yeah, I'm trying.
[42:17.050 --> 42:18.790]  Those are some pretty powerful bushes, Eric.
[42:19.430 --> 42:20.130]  I'm trying.
[42:24.560 --> 42:26.220]  I feel like we're being told things.
[42:26.540 --> 42:27.720]  Yeah, hold on.
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.820]  We're being shown a live feed of the CCTV.
[42:32.200 --> 42:32.340]  Oh, shit.
[42:33.180 --> 42:34.740]  Yeah, he's looped the cameras.
[42:37.360 --> 42:38.920]  Alright, what am I supposed to do with this?
[42:39.480 --> 42:40.260]  I don't know.
[42:43.320 --> 42:44.880]  Are we supposed to find something?
[42:45.120 --> 42:45.220]  Yeah.
[42:45.740 --> 42:46.500]  See that guard?
[42:46.780 --> 42:47.940]  Yeah, I see him. The guy at the front?
[42:48.040 --> 42:48.160]  Yeah.
[42:48.160 --> 42:48.580]  Yeah.
[42:49.380 --> 42:50.660]  We're going to have to kill these guys, right?
[42:51.340 --> 42:51.780]  There's one.
[42:52.080 --> 42:53.180]  Yeah, there's one up there.
[42:54.240 --> 42:55.040]  Is he shooting?
[42:55.980 --> 42:56.900]  No, they will be, though.
[42:57.100 --> 42:57.220]  He's welding.
[42:58.440 --> 42:59.340]  Okay, I've seen enough.
[43:00.580 --> 43:00.940]  Okay.
[43:03.640 --> 43:05.960]  I feel like we're supposed to... Okay, never mind.
[43:06.400 --> 43:07.980]  I don't know how to get out of the... There we go.
[43:08.900 --> 43:09.620]  Okay, let's...
[43:09.620 --> 43:09.780]  Get the mask.
[43:09.960 --> 43:10.820]  We have ten minutes.
[43:11.520 --> 43:11.820]  Okay.
[43:12.200 --> 43:13.940]  So we got to kill these guys and come back to the car?
[43:13.940 --> 43:14.620]  We got to go kill these fools.
[43:15.360 --> 43:15.720]  Quietly.
[43:15.840 --> 43:16.000]  Yeah.
[43:21.100 --> 43:22.280]  Put your mask on.
[43:22.440 --> 43:22.880]  Yeah.
[43:24.020 --> 43:24.460]  Alright.
[43:25.280 --> 43:25.720]  Let's...
[43:27.500 --> 43:29.000]  We're going to have to kill two of them at the same time.
[43:29.000 --> 43:29.420]  Oh, someone missed.
[43:29.740 --> 43:30.700]  Oh, bollocks.
[43:31.240 --> 43:31.700]  Who missed?
[43:34.460 --> 43:35.660]  I don't think anyone missed.
[43:36.660 --> 43:37.480]  One guy's dead.
[43:37.800 --> 43:38.880]  The other guy's not looking, though.
[43:40.820 --> 43:42.080]  Alright, there's a guy up ahead of him.
[43:42.420 --> 43:43.220]  Yeah, let's see.
[43:44.360 --> 43:45.020]  I'll pick him off.
[43:45.220 --> 43:45.400]  Okay.
[43:46.120 --> 43:46.540]  Bip.
[43:47.280 --> 43:47.600]  Alright.
[43:47.960 --> 43:48.260]  Nice.
[43:48.700 --> 43:49.160]  This way.
[43:51.360 --> 43:52.820]  So which way do we have to go?
[43:52.860 --> 43:53.740]  Oh, here comes a car coming.
[43:53.920 --> 43:54.160]  Car coming.
[43:54.280 --> 43:54.540]  Car coming.
[43:54.680 --> 43:55.000]  Oh.
[43:55.300 --> 43:55.880]  Hide around the side.
[43:56.940 --> 43:57.940]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[43:58.700 --> 43:58.880]  Here.
[43:59.100 --> 44:00.700]  Take cover behind these stairs.
[44:02.020 --> 44:02.460]  What is he doing?
[44:02.520 --> 44:03.000]  Is he coming out?
[44:03.720 --> 44:04.460]  He's going around.
[44:04.560 --> 44:05.060]  Oh, he's turning.
[44:05.320 --> 44:05.700]  He's going out.
[44:06.140 --> 44:07.140]  Who the hell's outside?
[44:07.300 --> 44:07.440]  Me.
[44:09.960 --> 44:11.340]  Are they getting out to check on the bodies?
[44:11.680 --> 44:11.920]  Yeah.
[44:12.520 --> 44:13.040]  Alright, kill him.
[44:15.640 --> 44:16.120]  He's dead.
[44:16.600 --> 44:16.720]  Dead.
[44:18.680 --> 44:19.000]  Nice.
[44:19.000 --> 44:19.320]  Okay.
[44:20.560 --> 44:21.760]  Should we keep working our way around?
[44:21.840 --> 44:21.940]  Yeah.
[44:22.080 --> 44:22.580]  I think so.
[44:23.700 --> 44:26.000]  Alright, we might need some synchronized bips coming up.
[44:26.240 --> 44:26.460]  Okay.
[44:26.720 --> 44:27.140]  Where are you?
[44:28.560 --> 44:30.500]  I'm with you on the right, Gavin.
[44:31.960 --> 44:32.280]  Okay.
[44:33.260 --> 44:33.780]  Where's Andy?
[44:33.960 --> 44:34.380]  You can do it.
[44:34.560 --> 44:36.040]  If you have the sniper, go for it.
[44:36.060 --> 44:37.240]  I ended up way up ahead.
[44:37.540 --> 44:37.880]  I got it.
[44:38.820 --> 44:40.180]  Bip this guy up there.
[44:40.300 --> 44:40.640]  3, 2, 1.
[44:41.240 --> 44:41.560]  Okay.
[44:42.120 --> 44:44.140]  We're gonna come around this corner on our left side, Gavin.
[44:44.140 --> 44:46.140]  Stay quiet.
[44:47.340 --> 44:48.060]  Keep moving.
[44:48.460 --> 44:49.440]  Okay, let's snipe one each.
[44:50.880 --> 44:51.700]  Where are you?
[44:52.760 --> 44:54.320]  Alright, there's one down by the wheel.
[44:54.420 --> 44:55.100]  There's one on the left.
[44:55.260 --> 44:56.640]  I could do the wheel guy.
[44:57.480 --> 44:58.440]  Yeah, go for it.
[44:58.540 --> 44:59.380]  And then I got the one on the left.
[44:59.460 --> 44:59.580]  Ready?
[44:59.860 --> 45:00.320]  3, 2...
[45:00.320 --> 45:00.800]  Alright, on 3.
[45:02.640 --> 45:03.940]  1, 2, 3.
[45:06.160 --> 45:07.000]  You didn't get him.
[45:07.980 --> 45:08.700]  He ducked.
[45:10.820 --> 45:11.180]  Whoa.
[45:12.100 --> 45:12.460]  Gavin.
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.560]  Oh, you killed scientists.
[45:13.760 --> 45:14.120]  Yeah, I know.
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.180]  Because they sounded the alarm.
[45:16.740 --> 45:16.920]  Yeah.
[45:17.060 --> 45:18.620]  So they had to die for their crimes.
[45:18.960 --> 45:19.100]  Yeah.
[45:20.460 --> 45:20.980]  Gavin.
[45:22.120 --> 45:23.600]  I said Eric allowed a scientist.
[45:24.320 --> 45:25.720]  I didn't allow the scientist.
[45:25.880 --> 45:26.460]  They were running.
[45:29.840 --> 45:31.760]  You didn't kill the guy one shot.
[45:32.960 --> 45:33.900]  It's dark.
[45:35.480 --> 45:35.680]  Yeah?
[45:35.740 --> 45:36.180]  Yeah!
[45:36.500 --> 45:37.540]  For all of us.
[45:44.180 --> 45:45.260]  Alright, that guy's dead.
[45:45.540 --> 45:45.920]  Got him.
[45:47.780 --> 45:49.840]  Don't forget, that car is going to come out to investigate.
[45:50.640 --> 45:51.040]  So...
[45:51.040 --> 45:51.120]  Yep.
[45:52.700 --> 45:53.580]  Alright, that guy's dead.
[45:54.220 --> 45:54.620]  Dead.
[45:55.460 --> 45:56.540]  Gotta wait for the car.
[45:57.240 --> 45:58.560]  I'm going to the other side.
[46:01.520 --> 46:02.460]  Anyone want to join me?
[46:04.100 --> 46:05.080]  I'm waiting for the car.
[46:07.160 --> 46:07.720]  Car's coming.
[46:09.200 --> 46:10.080]  They're going right.
[46:10.520 --> 46:11.340]  He's looking for me.
[46:12.400 --> 46:13.600]  Somebody can shoot him.
[46:14.240 --> 46:14.460]  Gavin.
[46:17.420 --> 46:18.000]  I got him.
[46:18.080 --> 46:18.400]  He's spotted.
[46:18.740 --> 46:19.280]  I got him.
[46:19.420 --> 46:19.600]  Wow.
[46:19.920 --> 46:20.560]  Oh, thank God.
[46:20.660 --> 46:21.460]  You got him just in time.
[46:21.560 --> 46:22.800]  Because he was like...
[46:22.800 --> 46:24.100]  He had spotted me in that moment.
[46:25.020 --> 46:26.020]  Alright, I'm going to go on the tower.
[46:26.780 --> 46:26.960]  Yeah.
[46:28.840 --> 46:29.160]  Oh.
[46:29.980 --> 46:30.960]  I killed him already.
[46:31.440 --> 46:31.640]  Okay.
[46:32.060 --> 46:32.420]  Oh, great.
[46:32.800 --> 46:33.260]  Okay, Gavin.
[46:33.300 --> 46:34.420]  Do we want to do the two again or what?
[46:35.100 --> 46:35.400]  Yeah.
[46:35.920 --> 46:37.280]  Do you want the left or do you want the tire?
[46:38.660 --> 46:40.100]  Let me get a better angle.
[46:40.380 --> 46:40.580]  Okay.
[46:43.020 --> 46:43.700]  Hey, prick.
[46:43.800 --> 46:44.420]  Why don't you shut up?
[46:44.960 --> 46:45.620]  Okay, ready?
[46:46.040 --> 46:46.120]  No.
[46:47.740 --> 46:49.540]  Are you getting the guy on the left or on the guy on the tire?
[46:50.340 --> 46:50.700]  Tire.
[46:51.040 --> 46:51.380]  Okay.
[46:51.700 --> 46:52.300]  Here we go.
[46:52.860 --> 46:53.160]  Hang on.
[46:53.340 --> 46:53.600]  One.
[46:54.700 --> 46:55.060]  One.
[46:55.420 --> 46:55.700]  Two.
[46:56.040 --> 46:56.260]  Three.
[47:00.500 --> 47:01.480]  What is wrong?
[47:02.540 --> 47:02.900]  Guys.
[47:03.140 --> 47:03.320]  Hey, Gavin.
[47:03.860 --> 47:04.220]  Guys.
[47:05.200 --> 47:05.860]  Hey, Gavin.
[47:06.440 --> 47:06.800]  Gavin.
[47:06.960 --> 47:07.620]  I don't know what to do.
[47:08.140 --> 47:08.580]  Hey, Gavin.
[47:09.080 --> 47:10.160]  I don't know what to do.
[47:10.200 --> 47:11.300]  Why does it keep showing me?
[47:11.580 --> 47:11.860]  Just hit him.
[47:12.480 --> 47:13.180]  Just shoot him.
[47:13.700 --> 47:14.540]  Yeah, I don't know why you...
[47:14.580 --> 47:16.000]  I don't know how you're not killing him.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.840]  I keep firing at him and then he's alive after.
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.420]  I mean, I shot my guy in the head.
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.900]  All right, why don't we switch guys?
[47:25.720 --> 47:26.120]  Okay.
[47:27.160 --> 47:27.560]  Ready?
[47:27.740 --> 47:28.300]  On three.
[47:28.500 --> 47:29.900]  One, two, three.
[47:31.420 --> 47:32.080]  All right.
[47:33.060 --> 47:34.000]  So I'm not...
[47:36.020 --> 47:36.840]  So now what?
[47:37.380 --> 47:37.880]  Hold on.
[47:38.640 --> 47:40.100]  We should not kill the two scientists.
[47:40.340 --> 47:41.020]  Don't kill the scientists.
[47:41.720 --> 47:43.560]  One of them is in sight of one of the other guys.
[47:43.560 --> 47:44.060]  Okay.
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.560]  Okay, there's a guy at the back.
[47:48.620 --> 47:49.620]  Where are the other two?
[47:54.040 --> 47:55.880]  Oh shit, I watched that guy's head go.
[47:56.420 --> 47:57.100]  Okay, I got one.
[47:57.460 --> 48:01.020]  That alerted someone to come walking over.
[48:03.160 --> 48:05.080]  Nope, I think that's just part of their loop.
[48:06.260 --> 48:07.600]  Okay, two of these guys are looking.
[48:08.100 --> 48:08.580]  Oh shit.
[48:09.220 --> 48:11.440]  There's two scientists walking towards the stairs.
[48:11.980 --> 48:13.780]  All right, we should take out these two over here then.
[48:14.980 --> 48:17.580]  So they don't make us...
[48:17.580 --> 48:17.940]  The scientists?
[48:18.220 --> 48:18.340]  Yeah.
[48:18.680 --> 48:19.580]  I don't think we're supposed to.
[48:19.920 --> 48:20.140]  Are we?
[48:20.300 --> 48:21.100]  I don't think it matters.
[48:21.600 --> 48:22.100]  I think you can.
[48:22.280 --> 48:23.780]  At the back there is a...
[48:24.420 --> 48:24.980]  Andrew, do you...
[48:24.980 --> 48:26.840]  These two scientists are walking towards a guard and another scientist.
[48:27.300 --> 48:28.760]  Gavin, do you want to kill one of these two with me?
[48:29.720 --> 48:30.200]  Which two?
[48:30.480 --> 48:31.100]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[48:31.120 --> 48:32.080]  The two closest to us.
[48:33.200 --> 48:33.820]  The two scientists.
[48:33.860 --> 48:34.660]  I know, I'm with you.
[48:41.320 --> 48:41.640]  There...
[48:41.640 --> 48:42.320]  You may not be able to see them from the stairs.
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.220]  Nick really wants to kill those two scientists.
[48:44.380 --> 48:45.420]  Can you just do it for him, please?
[48:45.420 --> 48:47.120]  We need to get the insurgent past them.
[48:47.480 --> 48:48.400]  So they're going to have to die.
[48:48.700 --> 48:50.120]  There's four people right at the back.
[48:52.700 --> 48:54.740]  All right, I'm going to go upstairs and kill this guy.
[49:03.700 --> 49:05.240]  There are four guys back here, yeah.
[49:05.620 --> 49:06.860]  Yeah, kill that guy at the top, Nick.
[49:07.260 --> 49:08.060]  Oh, fuck.
[49:08.700 --> 49:09.080]  What happened?
[49:10.660 --> 49:12.000]  Oh, that's the letter to him.
[49:12.020 --> 49:12.920]  Oh, what happened?
[49:13.960 --> 49:14.900]  He didn't die.
[49:16.240 --> 49:17.260]  Maybe we just kill everyone.
[49:17.600 --> 49:18.320]  Yeah, I think so.
[49:20.320 --> 49:20.680]  Okay.
[49:21.440 --> 49:21.860]  You ready?
[49:22.860 --> 49:23.820]  You guys can go for it.
[49:24.760 --> 49:25.500]  Which one do you want?
[49:25.540 --> 49:26.340]  You having left or right?
[49:26.900 --> 49:27.320]  Oh, God.
[49:27.440 --> 49:27.880]  Last again.
[49:28.460 --> 49:28.740]  Okay.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.860]  Three, two, one, go.
[49:34.640 --> 49:35.000]  Nice.
[49:35.040 --> 49:36.260]  And I'm a scientist on the left?
[49:36.480 --> 49:36.920]  On the right, I mean?
[49:36.920 --> 49:37.500]  Yeah, on the right.
[49:37.500 --> 49:38.040]  I'll take the left one.
[49:38.100 --> 49:38.220]  Ready?
[49:38.700 --> 49:38.980]  Okay.
[49:39.320 --> 49:42.220]  Three, two, one, go.
[49:44.540 --> 49:44.900]  Okay.
[49:45.080 --> 49:45.460]  Dead as shit.
[49:47.640 --> 49:48.240]  Let's push up.
[49:48.240 --> 49:49.960]  Do you want to stay up top like you were before?
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.480]  Yeah, I'll keep an eye up here.
[49:56.290 --> 49:57.830]  Okay, now let's get these scientists, Gavin.
[49:58.870 --> 49:59.570]  Move up.
[49:59.730 --> 49:59.970]  Hold on.
[50:03.390 --> 50:03.970]  Okay, ready?
[50:04.490 --> 50:05.350]  I'll get the one in front.
[50:06.010 --> 50:06.530]  Front one.
[50:06.630 --> 50:06.910]  Front one.
[50:07.290 --> 50:08.110]  Okay, I'll get the back one.
[50:08.710 --> 50:08.870]  Okay.
[50:08.950 --> 50:11.850]  Three, two, one, go.
[50:13.810 --> 50:15.590]  And then the far end?
[50:16.790 --> 50:17.130]  Yeah.
[50:17.470 --> 50:18.230]  I'll take the guard.
[50:18.830 --> 50:19.530]  You'll take the scientist?
[50:21.570 --> 50:22.210]  One second.
[50:22.350 --> 50:24.650]  I'm just going to get the guard that is overwatching.
[50:24.650 --> 50:24.950]  Oh, hang on.
[50:25.130 --> 50:26.310]  I think we've got the scientist moving over.
[50:26.430 --> 50:26.650]  Hold on.
[50:26.950 --> 50:27.790]  We might need three of us here.
[50:28.510 --> 50:28.750]  Okay.
[50:29.770 --> 50:30.270]  What happened?
[50:30.330 --> 50:30.670]  Did he disappear?
[50:31.150 --> 50:32.470]  I killed the guy top left.
[50:32.910 --> 50:33.510]  Oh, okay, cool.
[50:33.630 --> 50:33.850]  Good work.
[50:34.150 --> 50:35.230]  So now it's just two of them, right?
[50:35.850 --> 50:36.070]  Yeah.
[50:36.270 --> 50:37.450]  Okay, I'll take the guy on the right.
[50:38.370 --> 50:38.910]  The guard?
[50:39.290 --> 50:39.550]  Yeah.
[50:40.230 --> 50:40.530]  Okay.
[50:40.770 --> 50:42.430]  Three, two, one.
[50:43.950 --> 50:44.270]  Nice.
[50:44.510 --> 50:44.730]  Okay.
[50:45.050 --> 50:45.630]  There we go.
[50:45.810 --> 50:47.290]  Now we've got to get the insurgent in here?
[50:47.410 --> 50:47.530]  Is that the thing?
[50:47.530 --> 50:48.070]  I'm going to go get it.
[50:48.070 --> 50:48.150]  Is that the thing?
[50:48.710 --> 50:49.310]  You got it, Nick?
[50:49.430 --> 50:49.930]  Let's see.
[50:49.950 --> 50:50.210]  Yeah.
[50:54.550 --> 50:56.130]  Yeah, yeah, we've got to get the insurgent.
[50:56.550 --> 50:57.650]  I'm just going to wait in here.
[50:58.250 --> 50:59.030]  Yeah, I'll be right back.
[51:02.350 --> 51:05.190]  I wish I could case you and put you in cuffs right now.
[51:06.310 --> 51:08.570]  I don't like you walking around with a gasket.
[51:08.910 --> 51:09.270]  No.
[51:10.590 --> 51:11.390]  I'm getting out of your way, Nick.
[51:11.390 --> 51:14.970]  I'm going to go ahead and park here before Gavin lights shit on fire.
[51:16.290 --> 51:16.990]  I'm hacking.
[51:16.990 --> 51:17.750]  You got it, Andrew?
[51:18.770 --> 51:19.690]  I'm hacking away.
[51:25.140 --> 51:25.580]  Oh.
[51:26.280 --> 51:26.720]  What's up?
[51:27.760 --> 51:28.600]  It's a mini-game.
[51:28.900 --> 51:29.140]  Okay.
[51:31.420 --> 51:33.680]  I thought it would just automatically do it for me.
[51:33.980 --> 51:35.600]  A game within a game?
[51:36.720 --> 51:37.700]  Who could have...
[51:37.700 --> 51:38.060]  Yes.
[51:38.220 --> 51:38.680]  Oh, shit.
[51:40.580 --> 51:40.980]  Okay.
[51:42.900 --> 51:43.820]  Gavin, no.
[51:44.400 --> 51:46.420]  I'm going to go ahead and pull in before that kills us.
[51:46.500 --> 51:47.900]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[51:51.140 --> 51:51.500]  Alright.
[51:51.660 --> 51:53.520]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[51:53.520 --> 51:53.560]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[51:54.980 --> 51:55.920]  Should we nick this car?
[51:56.000 --> 51:56.360]  Absolutely.
[51:56.920 --> 51:58.180]  I'm nicking it.
[51:59.780 --> 52:00.280]  It's locked.
[52:01.080 --> 52:01.600]  Alright, shit.
[52:02.020 --> 52:02.420]  Oh, it is?
[52:03.540 --> 52:04.000]  Get out of here.
[52:05.560 --> 52:05.740]  Run.
[52:09.340 --> 52:11.180]  I'll bet the one with the dude who's dead is...
[52:12.300 --> 52:13.680]  Is it still raining inside, Nick?
[52:15.220 --> 52:15.580]  No.
[52:16.600 --> 52:16.960]  No!
[52:17.300 --> 52:17.920]  No, it cleared out.
[52:18.380 --> 52:18.560]  Yeah.
[52:19.460 --> 52:20.420]  Not sunny yet, though.
[52:21.280 --> 52:22.860]  I didn't think I'd drive to Gavin's.
[52:22.940 --> 52:23.600]  Not yet, Gavin.
[52:25.200 --> 52:27.340]  There's a Merryweather team inbound, is that what it said?
[52:28.540 --> 52:29.300]  I didn't notice.
[52:30.360 --> 52:31.540]  Oh, the car's gone.
[52:34.580 --> 52:35.560]  Oh no, I fell!
[52:35.720 --> 52:35.960]  What do you mean?
[52:36.500 --> 52:38.320]  What do you mean the car's gone? The car we just parked in the garage?
[52:39.000 --> 52:39.500]  No, no, no.
[52:39.680 --> 52:41.280]  The car the guy we killed at the exit.
[52:41.280 --> 52:42.760]  You guys leaving or what? What's going on?
[52:43.400 --> 52:44.120]  Yeah, what are you doing?
[52:45.760 --> 52:46.340]  I've left.
[52:46.500 --> 52:48.260]  How far do we have to go?
[52:48.260 --> 52:49.100]  I'm in the mountains.
[52:49.280 --> 52:49.400]  Pretty far.
[52:51.080 --> 52:53.020]  We should have left a bunch of scooters.
[52:53.600 --> 52:54.840]  Oh, is this Merryweather here?
[52:55.180 --> 52:55.300]  Yes.
[52:55.300 --> 52:55.900]  Oh shit.
[53:00.900 --> 53:02.120]  Oh, oh shit.
[53:02.500 --> 53:03.720]  Just keep going into the hills.
[53:06.640 --> 53:07.740]  Should we blow them all up?
[53:07.900 --> 53:08.200]  No.
[53:08.440 --> 53:08.740]  No!
[53:09.320 --> 53:10.020]  That'd be cool, though.
[53:10.300 --> 53:11.040]  I mean, it'd be awesome.
[53:11.040 --> 53:13.000]  He he he he he.
[53:18.420 --> 53:22.420]  A heist where you hire a guy who's really worried about everything being cool.
[53:23.700 --> 53:24.880]  It did look cool enough.
[53:26.020 --> 53:26.660]  Don't die.
[53:29.320 --> 53:30.100]  Uh oh, someone's slipping.
[53:30.540 --> 53:31.900]  Oh, falling down the mountain.
[53:32.660 --> 53:33.280]  This is a wet hill.
[53:33.400 --> 53:34.160]  Oh, I'm stumbled.
[53:34.400 --> 53:35.340]  Oh balls, oh balls.
[53:35.760 --> 53:36.140]  I've stumbled.
[53:37.060 --> 53:38.160]  Oh damn it!
[53:39.260 --> 53:40.900]  I'm out, I'm out now, I'm out.
[53:41.040 --> 53:41.560]  Are you?
[53:41.920 --> 53:42.820]  I'm waiting for my team.
[53:42.920 --> 53:43.460]  Alright, I'm coming.
[53:44.520 --> 53:45.840]  Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[53:47.600 --> 53:47.920]  Dick.
[53:48.940 --> 53:49.260]  Dick.
[53:49.700 --> 53:51.240]  You landed in the same shrub that I did.
[53:51.240 --> 53:51.620]  I sure did.
[53:54.800 --> 53:56.060]  It's a low-down shrub.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  We work with idiots.
[53:59.120 --> 53:59.560]  Yeah, we do.
[54:00.300 --> 54:01.640]  It's raining and slippery, right?
[54:01.640 --> 54:02.780]  Yeah, what the hell do you want?
[54:03.620 --> 54:04.680]  I don't know, to meet me here.
[54:04.680 --> 54:05.760]  For you to leave the humane.
[54:06.180 --> 54:07.380]  After we made it when it was raining.
[54:07.540 --> 54:09.480]  I mean, that's what we were trying to do, man.
[54:09.600 --> 54:10.120]  Come on.
[54:14.220 --> 54:14.580]  Yeah!
[54:16.980 --> 54:18.200]  Oh, silver, oh.
[54:18.520 --> 54:19.520]  Oh, and platinum.
[54:21.680 --> 54:22.400]  Little platy.
[54:22.780 --> 54:24.000]  Loads of money, boys.
[54:25.940 --> 54:26.800]  That was a good video.
[54:27.700 --> 54:28.420]  We're prepped.
[54:28.900 --> 54:30.700]  There's a shitload to cut out of that one.
[54:31.880 --> 54:33.840]  I mean, what, all the...
[54:33.840 --> 54:35.860]  Listen, we got a lot of good Stump Boy stuff.
[54:35.980 --> 54:36.600]  Stump Boy?
[54:36.800 --> 54:39.200]  We blew up a lot of planes while we were trying to get back to the apartment.
[54:39.700 --> 54:40.680]  You've watched us prep.
[54:40.720 --> 54:41.580]  We've done all the prep.
[54:41.580 --> 54:43.420]  Next video is the heist.
[54:43.580 --> 54:44.880]  Thank you so much for watching.

[54:58.700 --> 55:00.320]  This is a nightmare.
[55:01.180 --> 55:02.380]  Thank you for watching.
