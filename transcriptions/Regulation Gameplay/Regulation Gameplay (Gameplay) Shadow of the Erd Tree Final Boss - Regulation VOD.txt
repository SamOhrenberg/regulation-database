[00:00.000 --> 00:01.400]  This is going to be a disaster.
[00:01.720 --> 00:02.760]  And I'm going to be...
[00:02.760 --> 00:06.600]  There are people that are like, I play Alban Ring seriously,
[00:06.620 --> 00:08.860]  like a great player, and I don't use summon.
[00:09.040 --> 00:10.740]  I'm going to summon everybody I can.
[00:11.280 --> 00:14.960]  If I could blow a horn that brought in 50 other AI to fight
[00:14.960 --> 00:17.140]  this guy with me, I would do it.
[00:17.440 --> 00:18.860]  I have no shame in that regard.
[00:18.940 --> 00:19.840]  We got to kill a bad guy.
[00:20.620 --> 00:21.440]  I don't need all the credit.
[00:21.480 --> 00:23.840]  I don't need to prove I'm some big badass in Alban Ring.
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.280]  We got to kill this guy.
[00:26.000 --> 00:26.860]  He's causing problems.
[00:26.960 --> 00:28.500]  He's lighting trees on fire.
[00:28.500 --> 00:29.780]  I guess we like trees on fire.
[00:30.020 --> 00:30.580]  Never mind.
[00:31.020 --> 00:32.320]  I guess we're OK with that.
[00:32.660 --> 00:34.140]  But he he's doing bad stuff.
[00:34.580 --> 00:36.840]  I didn't read the lore, but he's
[00:37.400 --> 00:39.640]  he's not he's no good.
[00:41.920 --> 00:44.480]  I found something made him way too tanky for me.
[00:45.300 --> 00:48.160]  The summoning make him more tanky.
[00:50.800 --> 00:52.780]  I have so many questions now about this,
[00:52.820 --> 00:54.700]  because I I don't read anything with this game.
[00:54.980 --> 00:57.460]  I'm probably fucking up in countless ways.
[00:59.340 --> 01:00.120]  Oh, really?
[01:01.740 --> 01:02.180]  Huh?
[01:03.860 --> 01:08.040]  Does that oh, excuse me, does that count if it's my mimic tier as well?
[01:09.100 --> 01:11.520]  As far as a summon buffing him.
[01:13.700 --> 01:14.800]  Because I've been close.
[01:17.100 --> 01:18.060]  Hello, people.
[01:18.820 --> 01:20.060]  OK, mimic tier doesn't.
[01:21.020 --> 01:22.100]  OK, well, that's interesting.
[01:22.560 --> 01:23.360]  So we're going to load up.
[01:23.780 --> 01:27.900]  I'm not going to be able to look at the chat all that much when I'm doing this.
[01:28.500 --> 01:30.640]  I'll do my best to do so between rounds.
[01:31.220 --> 01:33.800]  So what I've been doing is I've been summoning this dude.
[01:36.620 --> 01:37.580]  And back.
[01:38.680 --> 01:41.380]  The pureblood knight, and then I've been using my mimic tier,
[01:42.260 --> 01:46.220]  but maybe he's not worth it if it adds health to the guy.
[01:50.280 --> 01:53.080]  Hey, to all the people, thank you so much.
[01:54.980 --> 01:57.560]  I mean, BK64 saying I should summon his ass.
[02:01.450 --> 02:03.130]  I mean, I'm going to I'm going to summon him.
[02:03.190 --> 02:03.870]  I'm going to keep this going.
[02:04.610 --> 02:05.670]  I'm going to do a run.
[02:05.930 --> 02:09.950]  Now, I kind of have a cap on my runs because, as I said, I have no no shame.
[02:10.370 --> 02:12.150]  I have 26 rune arcs.
[02:13.110 --> 02:16.370]  And if I don't beat him within these 26 attempts.
[02:20.890 --> 02:23.650]  Then. Then I'm going to I'm going to end up stopping this
[02:23.650 --> 02:26.710]  and then having to go find some more rune arcs because I don't think I can do it
[02:26.710 --> 02:27.130]  without it.
[02:28.370 --> 02:30.930]  And look at all this health, bam.
[02:34.390 --> 02:36.050]  Don't die, please, I'm going to die a lot.
[02:38.910 --> 02:41.430]  Oh, thank you so much, all the people for subs.
[02:42.310 --> 02:44.650]  That's awesome and super appreciated. I'm sorry.
[02:45.510 --> 02:48.730]  I'm going to be bad at this and like shouting people out and that type of thing.
[02:50.630 --> 02:52.530]  Because I got to look at the screen a lot.
[02:53.650 --> 02:55.310]  What happens when you first try this?
[02:56.030 --> 02:57.490]  Death, most likely.
[02:57.830 --> 03:00.130]  You got this. OK, here we go.
[03:00.330 --> 03:01.530]  Imagine if I do this first try.
[03:01.610 --> 03:02.210]  There's no way.
[03:02.650 --> 03:03.350]  Imagine if I do.
[03:03.810 --> 03:04.850]  So we're going to go into the mist.
[03:05.510 --> 03:07.510]  I'm immediately going to ring my bell, ring my bell, ring my bell.
[03:07.570 --> 03:08.270]  Don't hit me. Don't hit me.
[03:08.410 --> 03:09.690]  Oh, OK, that's a problem.
[03:09.850 --> 03:10.510]  That's a problem.
[03:10.870 --> 03:12.010]  That happens sometimes.
[03:12.330 --> 03:13.670]  I got to move, got to move, got to move.
[03:14.410 --> 03:15.290]  Dodge, dodge, dodge.
[03:15.350 --> 03:16.370]  OK, he's looking at him.
[03:17.110 --> 03:17.870]  He's swinging in.
[03:17.930 --> 03:22.130]  My mimic tier is up and he's like, hey, dude, I'm here to stab you.
[03:22.370 --> 03:23.030]  So we're going to hit him.
[03:23.030 --> 03:24.910]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[03:25.130 --> 03:27.430]  OK, back away, back away, back away, back away.
[03:28.470 --> 03:29.870]  OK, now he's going to go into the sky.
[03:29.970 --> 03:32.090]  He's going to shoot all the meteors at them.
[03:34.310 --> 03:36.570]  Let's try to. Oh, fuck.
[03:38.050 --> 03:40.070]  Oh, oh, oh, OK, back away.
[03:41.030 --> 03:43.550]  No, no. OK, I'm going to heal.
[03:46.710 --> 03:48.450]  Don't do too much damage to the mimic tier.
[03:49.350 --> 03:50.750]  Don't do too much damage to me either.
[03:51.570 --> 03:54.390]  OK, we got to get him to, once we get him like a quarter.
[03:54.870 --> 03:58.490]  Oh, fuck. Oh, oh, oh, OK, heal, heal, heal.
[04:00.130 --> 04:01.510]  This isn't a bad run so far.
[04:01.750 --> 04:03.350]  This is OK. I can live with this.
[04:03.930 --> 04:05.430]  Get him in the, get him in the next phase.
[04:05.530 --> 04:06.390]  Get him in the next phase.
[04:06.630 --> 04:07.550]  Get him in the next phase.
[04:07.890 --> 04:10.290]  Oh. Oh.
[04:16.350 --> 04:19.190]  OK, let's watch this cutscene once.
[04:20.290 --> 04:21.290]  We're doing it once.
[04:29.740 --> 04:33.000]  And see, he's he's bad news, no good guy looks like that.
[04:34.100 --> 04:36.800]  He's got tusks on his big sword.
[04:38.420 --> 04:41.860]  And then I think, I don't know who this is, but she comes in and was like,
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.660]  oh, I guess sister.
[04:44.560 --> 04:46.340]  And they immediately clarify that.
[04:46.420 --> 04:48.900]  I don't know how I didn't know their relation.
[04:51.520 --> 04:55.060]  Now, he was a boss in the base game as well,
[04:55.520 --> 05:00.060]  but he was older and he rode around on a little donkey and that one.
[05:03.190 --> 05:04.810]  This is an impromptu stream.
[05:05.530 --> 05:09.630]  I have been trying to do this on and off for a few days now.
[05:11.390 --> 05:13.750]  And I figured if I'm going to spend like an hour,
[05:14.130 --> 05:16.110]  whatever, trying to do this, I might as well stream it.
[05:18.870 --> 05:21.010]  I think this guy was over
[05:21.630 --> 05:25.430]  like they they nerfed him as well in the base game, I believe.
[05:27.170 --> 05:29.550]  Holy shit, we got a level eight hype train.
[05:30.010 --> 05:32.250]  I don't really fully understand what that means, but it.
[05:32.410 --> 05:33.530]  Oh, game, sorry.
[05:33.850 --> 05:36.550]  Oh, OK, going shins, shins, hit him in the shins.
[05:36.930 --> 05:38.590]  OK, run, run, run, run.
[05:38.710 --> 05:39.930]  No, no, no, no.
[05:40.510 --> 05:41.630]  He doesn't typically do that.
[05:41.890 --> 05:42.890]  This is what he typically does.
[05:43.150 --> 05:43.990]  Go, go, go, go.
[05:44.170 --> 05:45.230]  Get to the edge, get to the edge.
[05:45.370 --> 05:49.650]  Oh, avoid, avoid, avoid, drink.
[05:51.470 --> 05:52.270]  No, no.
[05:53.810 --> 05:56.610]  Oh, oh, come on.
[05:56.690 --> 05:58.870]  Somebody on the squad get a hit in.
[05:59.830 --> 06:00.610]  Dry aggro.
[06:02.110 --> 06:02.850]  What's he doing?
[06:03.850 --> 06:04.830]  What's he doing?
[06:06.810 --> 06:07.570]  What's he doing?
[06:09.570 --> 06:10.250]  What's he doing?
[06:10.390 --> 06:10.990]  Oh, oh.
[06:12.990 --> 06:16.910]  No, no, no, no, no.
[06:18.030 --> 06:19.070]  Think about your feelings.
[06:21.570 --> 06:21.970]  Fuck.
[06:23.570 --> 06:24.930]  Where are those going? Are those at me?
[06:25.090 --> 06:26.070]  No. OK, heal.
[06:26.590 --> 06:27.210]  I'm all. No.
[06:27.390 --> 06:28.130]  What the fuck?
[06:28.370 --> 06:29.450]  I didn't do anything to you.
[06:30.150 --> 06:30.490]  No.
[06:33.810 --> 06:34.810]  Hits in, hits in.
[06:36.170 --> 06:36.490]  No.
[06:37.950 --> 06:38.590]  Fuck you.
[06:41.410 --> 06:41.810]  Heal.
[06:42.890 --> 06:43.790]  Oh, he's low.
[06:44.030 --> 06:44.430]  He's low.
[06:46.810 --> 06:48.350]  Get him, get him, get him.
[06:50.190 --> 06:50.550]  Ha!
[06:51.070 --> 06:51.430]  No!
[06:52.890 --> 06:53.250]  No!
[06:55.390 --> 06:56.110]  Oh, no.
[06:59.110 --> 06:59.830]  Oh, no.
[07:01.010 --> 07:02.170]  Wait, what did that do?
[07:03.570 --> 07:04.410]  What did that do?
[07:05.330 --> 07:06.490]  Oh, I just got to stay alive.
[07:06.830 --> 07:08.330]  Oh, shit, he's in the sky, isn't he?
[07:08.830 --> 07:09.350]  Where is he?
[07:10.330 --> 07:11.910]  There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is.
[07:12.130 --> 07:13.170]  Oh, oh, oh, fuck.
[07:13.330 --> 07:14.450]  Holy fuck, holy fuck.
[07:16.190 --> 07:16.670]  Get him.
[07:17.330 --> 07:18.070]  Get him, guys.
[07:19.150 --> 07:19.670]  Oh!
[07:21.130 --> 07:21.650]  No!
[07:22.150 --> 07:22.670]  No!
[07:23.190 --> 07:23.650]  No!
[07:24.630 --> 07:24.990]  Ah!
[07:25.430 --> 07:26.530]  Heal, heal, heal!
[07:27.010 --> 07:27.270]  No!
[07:33.010 --> 07:33.530]  Oh!
[07:35.210 --> 07:36.930]  That's the closest I've ever gotten.
[07:41.920 --> 07:42.440]  Goddamn.
[07:43.300 --> 07:45.080]  Can I put this thing in my inventory?
[07:45.780 --> 07:46.940]  So I don't have to go into a menu?
[07:49.660 --> 07:50.780]  How do I do that?
[07:51.120 --> 07:51.880]  Can I do that?
[07:55.830 --> 07:56.890]  Is this a possibility?
[08:02.510 --> 08:03.410]  Go to equipment.
[08:03.570 --> 08:04.310]  Okay, thank you.
[08:08.150 --> 08:09.590]  I have got a bunch of stuff.
[08:09.730 --> 08:11.010]  I mean, I'm never going to use those.
[08:11.130 --> 08:11.770]  Let's get rid of this.
[08:12.510 --> 08:13.810]  I'm not using this right now.
[08:14.050 --> 08:15.230]  I'm not using oil pots.
[08:19.000 --> 08:19.560]  I'm not using...
[08:19.560 --> 08:20.180]  Should I just...
[08:22.280 --> 08:23.460]  We're getting rid of everything?
[08:25.220 --> 08:27.140]  Outside of what we need.
[08:33.210 --> 08:34.550]  I got to go to the top.
[08:37.950 --> 08:39.630]  Is there anything else I can use?
[08:44.670 --> 08:45.630]  Oh, shit!
[08:47.450 --> 08:48.270]  What's happening?
[08:49.710 --> 08:50.570]  What is...
[08:50.570 --> 08:51.290]  Raid?
[08:51.710 --> 08:52.470]  We're getting raided?
[08:53.210 --> 08:54.150]  Oh, from Ray.
[08:54.550 --> 08:55.590]  Thank you so much, Ray.
[08:56.990 --> 08:58.330]  Oh, this is...
[08:58.330 --> 08:58.950]  Oh, God.
[09:00.150 --> 09:01.230]  This is going to be a problem.
[09:01.470 --> 09:03.470]  A lot of people are going to see me be really bad at this.
[09:04.690 --> 09:05.610]  Holy shit.
[09:06.290 --> 09:07.650]  Thank you so much, Ray.
[09:09.390 --> 09:10.790]  Let's go rave in some air.
[09:11.390 --> 09:12.130]  Please, no.
[09:13.770 --> 09:15.630]  Can you do this for...
[09:15.630 --> 09:16.790]  I don't know what that means.
[09:19.030 --> 09:21.150]  Oh, I'm going to get kissed by that lady again.
[09:21.370 --> 09:21.810]  A hundred percent.
[09:22.030 --> 09:23.210]  Even though that's never happened before.
[09:24.470 --> 09:26.230]  Is it as much of a different one?
[09:26.370 --> 09:26.950]  No, I like it.
[09:27.010 --> 09:27.870]  I like having the people.
[09:28.030 --> 09:29.510]  I know it buffs them, apparently.
[09:30.170 --> 09:33.630]  I just like having this man with me, by my side.
[09:33.750 --> 09:36.330]  Because it's something else for the boss to potentially hit.
[09:37.810 --> 09:38.210]  Uh...
[09:38.210 --> 09:39.350]  Okay, let's get this in the...
[09:39.350 --> 09:40.110]  So I got my...
[09:40.110 --> 09:40.350]  Okay.
[09:40.870 --> 09:41.590]  I like this.
[09:42.350 --> 09:43.010]  I like this.
[09:43.070 --> 09:44.250]  Is there anything else I should be taking?
[09:45.990 --> 09:47.450]  I'm going to open my inventory.
[09:48.010 --> 09:50.690]  And people that are actually smart and understand this game.
[09:51.110 --> 09:52.950]  Should I be taking any of these things?
[09:53.090 --> 09:54.650]  Oh, I got to pop my rune, first of all.
[09:55.590 --> 09:56.470]  Let's get that cooking.
[09:57.070 --> 09:57.990]  Give me that health.
[10:01.810 --> 10:02.210]  Uh...
[10:03.210 --> 10:03.610]  Talismans?
[10:03.710 --> 10:05.490]  Yeah, I guess I could mess with those, couldn't I?
[10:05.490 --> 10:07.110]  But I think I like the ones I have.
[10:07.490 --> 10:08.830]  Which ones do I got right now?
[10:09.910 --> 10:10.710]  Maximum health.
[10:11.110 --> 10:12.350]  Maximum health and stamina.
[10:14.650 --> 10:16.470]  I guess I don't need fire negation.
[10:16.590 --> 10:18.170]  Is there any fire in this fight?
[10:20.150 --> 10:22.710]  Oh my god, the hype train.
[10:22.870 --> 10:23.910]  There's a bunch of...
[10:23.910 --> 10:24.590]  Something happened.
[10:24.790 --> 10:25.790]  Oh, level 10!
[10:26.330 --> 10:28.490]  I think that's the furthest we've ever gotten for a stream.
[10:29.930 --> 10:30.650]  Uh, it's holy?
[10:31.070 --> 10:31.830]  Okay, let's see.
[10:31.870 --> 10:32.750]  Do I got holy damage?
[10:33.710 --> 10:34.190]  I could do...
[10:34.190 --> 10:36.550]  Because I've done so many things in this game.
[10:37.450 --> 10:39.450]  Fastly boost holy damage negation.
[10:41.410 --> 10:42.770]  Oh, let's throw this in, right?
[10:42.850 --> 10:43.430]  That'll be helpful.
[10:47.570 --> 10:49.090]  Oh, thank you so much.
[10:49.570 --> 10:50.650]  All of you for joining.
[10:51.290 --> 10:52.650]  Golden braid, that's helpful.
[10:54.190 --> 10:55.710]  He does physical and holy damage.
[10:55.710 --> 10:57.610]  Also, you're not bad at all for real.
[10:58.810 --> 11:00.050]  Oh, it's not first try, though.
[11:00.230 --> 11:02.810]  Just to be clear, that was my first try today.
[11:02.810 --> 11:06.850]  I have gotten just destroyed by this man.
[11:07.450 --> 11:07.990]  For several days.
[11:08.810 --> 11:10.730]  My audio is probably going to be terrible because I'm recording.
[11:10.830 --> 11:11.630]  I'm wearing two mics.
[11:11.970 --> 11:14.490]  Got my Xbox mic in, which is what you're hearing me with.
[11:14.790 --> 11:17.890]  I'm also recording this for a VOD, but my head is all over the place.
[11:18.410 --> 11:20.670]  So I apologize if you're watching the VOD of this.
[11:21.010 --> 11:22.270]  Assuming this even is a VOD.
[11:22.630 --> 11:23.130]  I don't know.
[11:23.450 --> 11:24.990]  I just decided to do this.
[11:25.850 --> 11:26.670]  Uh, okay.
[11:26.810 --> 11:27.590]  So we got that.
[11:28.990 --> 11:30.270]  Now we're in inventories.
[11:30.270 --> 11:31.410]  Is there any sneak?
[11:31.510 --> 11:33.490]  There's stuff that's like boost holy damage.
[11:33.670 --> 11:34.610]  Like this.
[11:35.650 --> 11:37.670]  Should I chow down on a pickled liver?
[11:38.430 --> 11:39.450]  Would that be helpful?
[11:41.230 --> 11:42.850]  Yeah, I have all the fragments.
[11:43.350 --> 11:44.130]  I got those.
[11:50.450 --> 11:51.430]  Oh, this is great.
[11:51.530 --> 11:59.570]  I can't thank y'all enough for both being here as well as just giving me any guidance on this.
[11:59.590 --> 12:03.130]  Because I have just stumbled through this game blindly.
[12:05.950 --> 12:06.670]  Physics elixir.
[12:08.610 --> 12:09.470]  Is that up here?
[12:10.910 --> 12:12.190]  I don't even know what that is.
[12:19.060 --> 12:20.120]  Or am I looking for this?
[12:23.040 --> 12:24.280]  Oh, I gotta brew it?
[12:24.620 --> 12:24.980]  Fuck.
[12:25.320 --> 12:25.640]  I don't know.
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.600]  I don't think I've ever brewed anything in this game.
[12:29.820 --> 12:30.180]  Uh.
[12:35.430 --> 12:36.730]  So I gotta make it, I guess.
[12:36.790 --> 12:37.730]  So I don't...
[12:37.730 --> 12:38.690]  Oh, this.
[12:39.950 --> 12:40.310]  Oh.
[12:41.810 --> 12:42.670]  Holy shit.
[12:42.710 --> 12:43.890]  Okay, so let's go into equipment.
[12:44.810 --> 12:46.130]  Let's throw that on.
[12:48.150 --> 12:49.070]  What does that do?
[12:51.070 --> 12:51.850]  I don't know.
[12:52.290 --> 12:53.770]  But it's empty, so whatever.
[12:54.670 --> 12:54.970]  Uh.
[12:56.190 --> 12:57.830]  I don't think I care about those.
[13:02.440 --> 13:02.880]  Uh.
[13:03.360 --> 13:04.720]  I can make it out of grace?
[13:05.600 --> 13:06.780]  Let's go back to grace.
[13:07.400 --> 13:08.040]  Let's look at this.
[13:08.740 --> 13:09.680]  See if I can get it all tanked up.
[13:09.680 --> 13:12.400]  I'm sorry all the people watching having to deal with me being...
[13:12.400 --> 13:14.140]  I can't because I got this guy with me.
[13:15.660 --> 13:16.280]  That's fine.
[13:16.560 --> 13:17.280]  We'll do it next time.
[13:18.580 --> 13:19.920]  Uh, so do I drink?
[13:20.320 --> 13:21.680]  Do I drink...
[13:23.080 --> 13:23.880]  this now?
[13:23.980 --> 13:25.080]  And then do I eat a liver?
[13:26.400 --> 13:28.240]  Oh my god, a whole bunch of subs.
[13:28.340 --> 13:30.040]  Thank you so much for subbing.
[13:31.300 --> 13:31.700]  Okay.
[13:31.980 --> 13:33.480]  I'm gonna suck this down.
[13:34.220 --> 13:35.360]  I don't know why I'm in my menu.
[13:35.700 --> 13:36.740]  Uh, I'm gonna suck it.
[13:38.020 --> 13:38.260]  Heh.
[13:39.780 --> 13:40.220]  Okay.
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.640]  Now we're gonna eat a liver.
[13:45.060 --> 13:46.880]  Oh, this is gonna be unfair now.
[13:47.260 --> 13:48.980]  I'm now gonna be OP against this guy.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.420]  Let's get the little bell going.
[13:51.720 --> 13:53.560]  Oh, you're coming at me immediately because you know.
[13:55.420 --> 13:57.040]  Uh, oh, oh, oh.
[13:57.620 --> 13:58.640]  Oh no, oh no.
[13:58.720 --> 13:59.800]  I'm almost dead already.
[14:00.000 --> 14:00.460]  Oh fuck.
[14:00.860 --> 14:01.060]  Okay.
[14:02.180 --> 14:02.620]  Uh.
[14:03.240 --> 14:05.040]  He's gonna throw meteors at somebody.
[14:05.100 --> 14:06.980]  It's not gonna be me because I haven't even hit him yet.
[14:08.400 --> 14:08.920]  Okay.
[14:09.440 --> 14:09.900]  Okay.
[14:10.940 --> 14:11.460]  Okay.
[14:12.140 --> 14:13.500]  You decided to do double that time.
[14:13.680 --> 14:14.560]  That was not cool.
[14:15.900 --> 14:17.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:17.400 --> 14:18.800]  Look at you and your fucking.
[14:21.080 --> 14:21.600]  Stupid.
[14:22.200 --> 14:22.680]  Red.
[14:24.060 --> 14:24.400]  Cape.
[14:25.460 --> 14:26.720]  I didn't know what I was gonna say.
[14:26.800 --> 14:27.540]  It just does mad.
[14:29.260 --> 14:29.760]  Get him.
[14:30.340 --> 14:30.660]  Get him.
[14:31.960 --> 14:32.320]  Oh.
[14:33.040 --> 14:33.340]  Oh.
[14:34.900 --> 14:35.940]  Think about your feelings.
[14:35.940 --> 14:36.900]  Think about your feelings.
[14:37.280 --> 14:37.860]  Think about your feelings.
[14:38.920 --> 14:39.240]  Process.
[14:40.720 --> 14:41.600]  Focalize your emotions.
[14:42.440 --> 14:43.140]  We can be peaceful.
[14:44.220 --> 14:45.020]  We can be friends.
[14:46.020 --> 14:46.340]  Yeah.
[14:47.140 --> 14:47.900]  Fuck him up AI.
[14:50.060 --> 14:50.380]  Woo.

[14:59.300 --> 15:00.000]  Now we gotta go in.
[15:01.000 --> 15:01.600]  We're gonna skip it.
[15:01.640 --> 15:02.400]  We're gonna hit him in the ankles.
[15:03.860 --> 15:04.180]  Ah.
[15:04.180 --> 15:05.640]  Cause sometimes that can stun him.
[15:06.140 --> 15:06.780]  Didn't stun him.
[15:07.340 --> 15:09.820]  I'm gonna heal cause I'm about to get fucked up by this.
[15:10.060 --> 15:10.240]  Yep.
[15:11.500 --> 15:14.020]  Okay, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[15:14.840 --> 15:16.200]  Fucking didn't dodge that.
[15:16.420 --> 15:17.300]  Didn't dodge that.
[15:19.380 --> 15:20.300]  We're in a bad way.
[15:20.460 --> 15:21.700]  We're in a bad way.

[15:26.700 --> 15:28.080]  Oh, this is not the run.
[15:29.880 --> 15:30.920]  Do I have to take anything?
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.420]  Okay, so I got my two flasks.
[15:36.190 --> 15:39.310]  I feel like the, the holy damage negation is helping.
[15:39.790 --> 15:42.130]  I feel like it's not as bad as it was.
[15:43.650 --> 15:44.170]  Okay.
[15:45.010 --> 15:46.330]  Doing a little suckage.
[15:47.410 --> 15:49.530]  What the fuck is happening?

[16:01.450 --> 16:02.170]  I need that mimic.

[17:17.270 --> 17:19.230]  I don't even know what two-handing the sword means.
[17:19.270 --> 17:20.710]  Am I supposed to two-hand the sword?

[18:06.470 --> 18:07.430]  Uh.
[18:07.570 --> 18:09.050]  I don't really charge attack.
[18:10.370 --> 18:12.390]  Ooh, that seems sort of helpful.

[18:14.650 --> 18:15.170]  Not using lightning.

[18:41.870 --> 18:45.210]  That feels like that was probably for a specific boss that I just didn't.
[18:46.690 --> 18:47.530]  To explode.
[18:47.690 --> 18:48.690]  Got to explode.

[19:51.460 --> 19:51.880]  I've literally.
[19:52.200 --> 19:54.740]  I've killed every other boss in this game.
[19:56.120 --> 19:57.660]  This is all I have left to do.
[19:58.660 --> 19:59.780]  And I've never used that.
[20:01.640 --> 20:03.100]  That's probably gonna be super helpful.
[20:03.300 --> 20:04.300]  So let's summon this guy.
[20:06.820 --> 20:08.020]  What's up, buddy?
[20:08.020 --> 20:10.300]  We got this Anzac.
[20:10.380 --> 20:11.460]  I like your scythe.
[20:12.540 --> 20:13.500]  Looking good.
[20:14.620 --> 20:17.020]  And now we're gonna drink this.
[20:18.580 --> 20:18.960]  Oh, wow.
[20:19.020 --> 20:19.940]  That's like a whole thing.
[20:19.980 --> 20:21.000]  I'm gonna eat one of these.
[20:22.160 --> 20:23.500]  Nope, that's fire.
[20:25.660 --> 20:26.440]  Eat a liver.
[20:27.900 --> 20:30.080]  And then get my bell out.
[20:32.480 --> 20:33.880]  Oh, I got a two-handed sword.
[20:33.960 --> 20:34.680]  I'll do that next time.
[20:35.980 --> 20:36.460]  Okay.
[20:40.020 --> 20:40.740]  Okay, that's...
[20:40.740 --> 20:41.020]  You can't...
[20:41.880 --> 20:42.880]  You can't do that.
[20:43.340 --> 20:44.540]  You can't do that.
[20:47.840 --> 20:48.200]  Okay.
[20:49.620 --> 20:50.740]  Sometimes you do that once.
[20:50.820 --> 20:51.640]  Sometimes you do that twice.
[20:51.740 --> 20:52.240]  I never know.
[20:52.460 --> 20:53.480]  I never know what you're doing.
[20:54.700 --> 20:55.820]  Now we're calming down.
[20:55.900 --> 20:56.440]  We're calming down.
[20:56.540 --> 20:57.140]  We're relaxing.
[20:57.320 --> 20:57.960]  We're zooming in.
[20:58.440 --> 20:59.040]  Getting in there.
[20:59.120 --> 20:59.700]  Getting in that ass.
[20:59.780 --> 21:00.460]  Getting in that ass.
[21:00.640 --> 21:00.940]  Get away.
[21:01.080 --> 21:01.300]  Get away.
[21:01.360 --> 21:01.980]  Get away from the ass.
[21:02.060 --> 21:02.640]  Get away from the ass.
[21:02.860 --> 21:03.420]  Back away.
[21:04.940 --> 21:05.840]  You doing it twice?
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.520]  You're doing it twice.
[21:06.620 --> 21:07.140]  You're doing it twice.
[21:07.220 --> 21:08.240]  Okay, it was a two-timer.
[21:08.440 --> 21:09.580]  I missed the two-timer.
[21:09.840 --> 21:10.680]  Even though I saw it coming.
[21:11.220 --> 21:11.700]  That's okay.
[21:11.840 --> 21:12.720]  I got this down.
[21:12.960 --> 21:13.660]  No, I don't.
[21:13.800 --> 21:14.300]  No, I don't.
[21:14.500 --> 21:15.660]  That timing was not good.
[21:16.420 --> 21:17.900]  Eat more of these potions.
[21:19.520 --> 21:20.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:20.280 --> 21:20.780]  Fuck him up.
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.140]  Fuck him up, knight.
[21:22.760 --> 21:23.640]  Fuck him up.
[21:30.260 --> 21:32.560]  And then he does a little shimmy.
[21:35.600 --> 21:36.400]  Ah, I've...
[21:36.400 --> 21:36.920]  Okay.
[21:39.420 --> 21:40.220]  Oh, I'm...
[21:40.220 --> 21:41.700]  Honestly, I'd rather he fuck up.
[21:42.820 --> 21:43.220]  Okay.
[21:45.040 --> 21:46.720]  I feel like this is a really good run.
[21:47.280 --> 21:48.240]  I feel like this is going great.
[21:50.180 --> 21:50.960]  Okay, shin him.
[21:51.180 --> 21:53.260]  We're going to hit him in the shin and hopefully he goes down.
[21:53.600 --> 21:55.680]  Because sometimes he can break his posture here.
[21:56.120 --> 21:58.560]  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[21:58.740 --> 21:59.060]  Fuck.
[21:59.060 --> 21:59.600]  Fuck.
[22:00.580 --> 22:02.460]  Nah, damn it.
[22:02.640 --> 22:02.760]  Okay.
[22:03.200 --> 22:04.720]  Run, run, run.
[22:05.740 --> 22:07.380]  Keep him alive, keep him alive, keep the hope alive.
[22:07.540 --> 22:07.940]  Keep the hope...
[22:07.940 --> 22:08.520]  Okay.
[22:09.280 --> 22:10.040]  Okay, man.
[22:11.100 --> 22:11.500]  Okay.
[22:12.920 --> 22:14.660]  I see what you're getting up to.
[22:15.220 --> 22:16.740]  Wait, is he kissing someone?
[22:16.800 --> 22:17.440]  Why can't I hit him?
[22:18.420 --> 22:19.500]  Oh, he wasn't kissing at all.
[22:20.940 --> 22:22.560]  I know what that stomp means.
[22:22.920 --> 22:23.820]  I don't know what this means.
[22:23.980 --> 22:24.640]  I can't see ya.
[22:27.120 --> 22:28.440]  Oh, I'm getting kissed again.
[22:30.200 --> 22:31.480]  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.
[22:32.040 --> 22:32.980]  A little smooch.
[22:34.640 --> 22:36.300]  That's probably a bad thing.
[22:36.480 --> 22:37.740]  I can't imagine that's good.
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.280]  No!
[22:46.340 --> 22:47.260]  Okay, that's fine.
[22:47.320 --> 22:48.060]  We can two-hand the sword.
[22:49.540 --> 22:50.620]  We can two-hand the sword.
[22:50.720 --> 22:51.840]  We can go into two-hand sword mode.
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.260]  It's no problem.
[22:55.720 --> 22:57.620]  Oh, I love that energy.
[22:58.600 --> 23:00.560]  Should he be locking on to him or would that be bad?
[23:00.660 --> 23:03.680]  I like not locking on because I can just run around more freely.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.800]  But that's probably wrong.
[23:06.680 --> 23:07.960]  Based on everything else I'm doing.
[23:08.060 --> 23:08.680]  So how do I...
[23:09.940 --> 23:11.340]  How do I two-hand this thing?
[23:13.220 --> 23:13.960]  Right hand?
[23:14.380 --> 23:15.540]  Do I double down on it?
[23:15.720 --> 23:16.340]  I don't even know.
[23:18.880 --> 23:20.360]  Y plus right bumper?
[23:26.860 --> 23:27.540]  What do I do?
[23:28.540 --> 23:29.400]  Yeah, I'm on a controller.
[23:30.500 --> 23:31.680]  No out of menu?
[23:32.660 --> 23:33.420]  What the fuck?
[23:34.400 --> 23:35.580]  Y plus right bumper?
[23:38.260 --> 23:38.820]  Whoa!
[23:39.960 --> 23:41.700]  I didn't know that was a thing!
[23:43.040 --> 23:43.480]  What are...
[23:43.480 --> 23:44.660]  What do these symbols...
[23:44.660 --> 23:46.040]  What do those mean on the left?
[23:46.100 --> 23:48.960]  Is that like different armor pieces I could apply or something?
[23:52.920 --> 23:54.040]  What is...
[23:54.040 --> 23:56.520]  Am I supposed to equip those?
[24:01.090 --> 24:02.510]  It's a shortcut menu?
[24:02.890 --> 24:03.630]  What is it?
[24:03.730 --> 24:04.570]  What does it shortcut?
[24:07.750 --> 24:09.430]  Oh, is it like throwing stuff?
[24:10.230 --> 24:13.150]  I bet you that's like how you're supposed to throw knives and stuff.
[24:15.970 --> 24:16.370]  Whatever.
[24:20.110 --> 24:20.510]  Okay.
[24:22.310 --> 24:23.370]  We're gonna run this back.
[24:23.430 --> 24:24.450]  We're gonna spawn our man.
[24:24.850 --> 24:25.990]  Wait, let me just swing like this.
[24:26.330 --> 24:27.050]  Oh, that's cool.
[24:29.230 --> 24:31.250]  What's the difference between one-handed and two-handed?
[24:39.810 --> 24:41.570]  Are you more damaged this way?
[24:42.910 --> 24:44.090]  Oh my god!
[24:45.850 --> 24:47.090]  Holy shit!
[24:49.410 --> 24:50.770]  That's insane!
[24:51.830 --> 24:52.150]  Okay.
[24:53.070 --> 24:54.270]  I feel good about this.
[24:54.350 --> 24:54.790]  I'm excited.
[24:57.090 --> 24:57.770]  Let's...
[25:00.930 --> 25:01.610]  Let's...
[25:02.290 --> 25:03.430]  Drink this.
[25:07.870 --> 25:09.050]  Need another liver.
[25:13.110 --> 25:13.950]  Oh, rune arc!
[25:14.070 --> 25:14.650]  Thank you.
[25:14.790 --> 25:15.750]  Oh, I almost forgot.
[25:17.850 --> 25:19.210]  Thank you so much, chat.
[25:20.070 --> 25:21.270]  That was almost bad.
[25:22.510 --> 25:23.590]  Okay, now I can ring my bell.
[25:24.470 --> 25:25.790]  Sometimes he doesn't do this.
[25:26.730 --> 25:27.910]  Sometimes he just walks.
[25:29.690 --> 25:32.550]  Okay, you can't kill me because I'm feeling the vibes on this run.
[25:32.670 --> 25:34.330]  So you need to at least let me get a few hits in.
[25:35.050 --> 25:37.010]  It's not allowed to be an instant death on this run.
[25:43.900 --> 25:48.260]  So, because I'm two-handed, I wonder if my mimic is also now two-handed.
[25:48.760 --> 25:49.060]  Fuck.
[25:49.240 --> 25:50.420]  Well, that was the worst run I've had.
[25:51.060 --> 25:52.460]  Two-hand curse, but that's a lot of damage.
[25:57.410 --> 25:57.810]  Um...
[26:02.150 --> 26:02.550]  Okay.
[26:04.930 --> 26:08.410]  So, because I'm two-handed, does my mimic now two-hand?
[26:09.090 --> 26:10.510]  As opposed to it being one-hand?
[26:13.770 --> 26:16.250]  You're psychic, so he doesn't hurt you with that first hit.
[26:16.250 --> 26:19.690]  I thought I'd have damage resistance on, I believe.
[26:22.570 --> 26:24.510]  Crimson Seed talisman?
[26:25.070 --> 26:26.110]  Okay, let's look at this.
[26:29.050 --> 26:30.790]  What does Crimson Seed do?
[26:33.790 --> 26:34.550]  Uh...
[26:36.900 --> 26:38.000]  Where are the talismans?
[26:39.480 --> 26:39.900]  There we go.
[26:43.020 --> 26:46.120]  Boost HP restoration from Flask of Tears.
[26:46.480 --> 26:46.940]  Ooh.
[26:51.600 --> 26:52.540]  That seems good.
[26:56.800 --> 26:57.920]  I like that a lot.
[26:58.700 --> 27:01.180]  I'm gonna get rid of this, and we're gonna put that on.
[27:02.860 --> 27:04.720]  Stamina still looks pretty good.
[27:06.780 --> 27:07.420]  Okay.
[27:08.320 --> 27:09.480]  Let's run this back.
[27:10.340 --> 27:11.420]  This is a whole new game.
[27:12.160 --> 27:13.180]  Two-handed swords?
[27:15.360 --> 27:16.320]  Going in.
[27:17.480 --> 27:19.120]  Got 23 more tries.
[27:21.540 --> 27:22.180]  Inventory...
[27:22.180 --> 27:24.220]  And then... eat another liver.
[27:27.820 --> 27:28.620]  And then...
[27:29.100 --> 27:32.200]  I probably did that out of sequence, right? I probably should've...
[27:32.200 --> 27:34.740]  I probably should've drank the first thing.
[27:35.980 --> 27:36.580]  I assume.
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.760]  Nope, he's still gonna rush at me. He's still gonna rush at me.
[27:42.340 --> 27:43.220]  Piece of shit.
[27:47.250 --> 27:47.650]  Okay.
[27:48.850 --> 27:50.390]  And then you do two of those.
[27:50.870 --> 27:52.550]  Swing, swing, swing, swing. Get in that ass!
[27:53.650 --> 27:55.950]  Okay, now you're gonna go into the sky. That might be for me.
[27:56.050 --> 27:56.950]  I don't know. I don't know.
[27:57.090 --> 27:57.670]  That is for me!
[27:57.950 --> 28:00.410]  Oh, wow! They all hit the... that was kind of useful.
[28:01.070 --> 28:04.610]  That was not intentional, but that really ruined his whole game plan.
[28:06.270 --> 28:08.390]  Okay, I'm getting... I'm getting too aggressive here. I'm getting too aggressive.
[28:08.510 --> 28:09.650]  We gotta back away, back away, back away.
[28:10.330 --> 28:11.490]  You don't gotta be so cute.
[28:12.890 --> 28:16.970]  Get the health in, get the health in. We're almost at the... we're almost at the thing.
[28:19.390 --> 28:21.730]  Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[28:22.410 --> 28:22.850]  Fuck.
[28:23.170 --> 28:25.910]  Hit him, come on. Get him to the transitional scene. We're right there.
[28:26.450 --> 28:27.070]  We're right there.
[28:28.390 --> 28:28.810]  Oh.
[28:29.630 --> 28:30.310]  Fuck yeah!
[28:30.590 --> 28:31.590]  BAM! BAM!
[28:31.930 --> 28:32.810]  What you want?
[28:33.410 --> 28:34.370]  What you want?
[28:35.210 --> 28:36.230]  Got you down.
[28:38.350 --> 28:39.850]  Skip. Let's get in there.
[28:40.190 --> 28:42.390]  Oh, fuck! We're so far away.
[28:43.490 --> 28:43.830]  Oh!
[28:44.230 --> 28:45.010]  Oh, shit!
[28:45.190 --> 28:46.570]  Go, go, go! Come on, guys! Run!
[28:47.050 --> 28:47.810]  Get out of the circle!
[28:49.110 --> 28:50.710]  Oh, dodge this! Dodge this stuff!
[28:50.710 --> 28:51.310]  Oh!
[28:52.610 --> 28:55.290]  Oh, he's throwing fucking frisbees at us!
[28:56.990 --> 28:58.010]  What is happening?
[28:58.670 --> 29:01.730]  Okay. No, I'm getting kissed. I'm getting smooched.
[29:02.610 --> 29:05.190]  Okay, compose yourself, relax while the kiss is happening.
[29:06.190 --> 29:08.090]  Get back in, get back in the zone.
[29:09.790 --> 29:11.770]  Everything's okay, stop freaking out, calm down.
[29:12.310 --> 29:12.890]  Calm down.
[29:13.270 --> 29:14.670]  You're just in the middle of a great run.
[29:15.350 --> 29:16.770]  It's okay, there's gonna be plenty of this.
[29:17.030 --> 29:17.710]  You don't need to be worried.
[29:17.930 --> 29:18.930]  You don't need to be...
[29:20.170 --> 29:21.710]  Heal! Heal! Heal! Heal! Heal!
[29:24.230 --> 29:25.730]  That was like, cut my hair.
[29:26.390 --> 29:27.070]  That was a pie.
[29:29.150 --> 29:29.870]  Oh, my God.
[29:31.350 --> 29:32.410]  That can't be at me.
[29:32.510 --> 29:33.950]  But then he's gonna go, hey, fuck you.
[29:34.010 --> 29:34.890]  He's gonna go, yeah.
[29:35.550 --> 29:36.190]  That's right.
[29:37.110 --> 29:37.950]  Oh, that was fake?
[29:38.330 --> 29:40.370]  Oh, I should have rolled or something there.
[29:41.350 --> 29:42.310]  Oh, my God.
[29:43.350 --> 29:43.710]  Dude.
[29:44.870 --> 29:45.810]  Dude, get a life.
[29:46.250 --> 29:47.110]  I say that respectfully.
[29:47.790 --> 29:48.770]  Who am I to judge?
[29:52.010 --> 29:52.970]  Getting that ass.
[29:53.350 --> 29:53.630]  Nope.
[29:54.050 --> 29:54.870]  Okay, we're healing, we're healing.
[29:54.930 --> 29:55.550]  We got a lot of health.
[29:55.810 --> 29:56.550]  We got a lot of health.
[29:56.630 --> 29:57.530]  We can feel good about it.
[29:57.770 --> 29:58.410]  We can feel good about...
[29:58.410 --> 29:59.790]  No, don't feel good about that.
[29:59.970 --> 30:00.550]  I hate that one.
[30:00.790 --> 30:01.710]  It's my least favorite attack.
[30:03.230 --> 30:06.610]  And then we got all this stupid golden stuff on the fucking ground.
[30:06.690 --> 30:07.690]  The mimic tears are not doing well.
[30:07.890 --> 30:08.370]  Let's get in there.
[30:08.570 --> 30:09.070]  Getting that damage.
[30:09.490 --> 30:10.530]  Oh, he's kissing someone else?
[30:11.090 --> 30:12.890]  Oh, you're giving smooches to somebody else?
[30:14.110 --> 30:15.750]  Everybody's getting smooched on this battlefield.
[30:17.110 --> 30:18.450]  We smooching left and right.
[30:20.070 --> 30:20.870]  We smooching.
[30:24.290 --> 30:25.510]  Okay, someone just died.
[30:26.350 --> 30:27.430]  That was fake me.
[30:29.530 --> 30:29.930]  Nope.
[30:30.150 --> 30:31.250]  Okay, back away, back away.
[30:31.330 --> 30:33.570]  Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[30:34.850 --> 30:36.130]  Come on, adds back.
[30:37.170 --> 30:38.230]  Keep it going, buddy.
[30:42.790 --> 30:43.930]  No, I'm getting kissed.
[30:44.030 --> 30:45.170]  I'm getting double smooched.
[30:45.350 --> 30:47.110]  Does a double smooch do more damage?
[30:47.790 --> 30:49.350]  Oh, my buddy's dead.
[30:49.490 --> 30:51.670]  He was jealous that I was getting double smooched.
[30:55.520 --> 30:56.000]  No!
[30:56.360 --> 30:57.480]  I was joking.
[30:58.260 --> 30:59.900]  Oh no, the double smooch.
[31:00.500 --> 31:02.840]  No, I got double smooched and that was it.
[31:02.880 --> 31:04.760]  That was the run and I got double smooched.
[31:06.220 --> 31:07.920]  You can't be double smooching.
[31:11.230 --> 31:13.250]  Oh, I got a better version of the Talisman?
[31:13.530 --> 31:14.290]  Let's do that.
[31:15.370 --> 31:16.570]  Get this out of here.
[31:18.410 --> 31:18.890]  Pfft.
[31:20.930 --> 31:21.310]  Yeah.
[31:21.770 --> 31:23.170]  Is there a better one of that too?
[31:23.450 --> 31:24.150]  No, okay.
[31:25.870 --> 31:26.250]  Stupid.
[31:26.510 --> 31:27.210]  You're dumb, Andrew.
[31:29.810 --> 31:31.230]  Wait, oh, I got an emote?
[31:32.590 --> 31:34.130]  Oh, let's get that in the rotation.
[31:35.870 --> 31:36.670]  Well, that was...
[31:36.670 --> 31:37.490]  No, I'm not celebrating.
[31:40.030 --> 31:40.710]  Where's that?
[31:40.930 --> 31:41.470]  Where's the me?
[31:43.090 --> 31:44.090]  Where's the one I just got?
[31:44.170 --> 31:44.670]  Oh, here we go.
[31:46.290 --> 31:46.670]  Okay.
[31:48.770 --> 31:49.870]  What level am I?
[31:49.870 --> 31:52.590]  I am level 200.
[31:54.150 --> 32:01.470]  99 Vigor, 10 Mind, 30 Endurance, 40 Strength, 75 Dexterity, 9 Intelligence, 9 Faith, 7 Arcane.
[32:01.570 --> 32:03.730]  9 Intelligence is an accurate representation.
[32:05.510 --> 32:05.970]  Hello, boss.
[32:06.010 --> 32:06.650]  You want a commitment?
[32:08.870 --> 32:13.390]  Oh, thanks so much for the support and the kindness of all of this.
[32:15.590 --> 32:19.190]  Y'all are making this seem a lot more doable than it was previously.
[32:21.030 --> 32:22.930]  So, let's drink.
[32:25.110 --> 32:27.870]  And then get that liver going.
[32:28.770 --> 32:30.970]  I'm gonna run out of these at some point, but that's fine.
[32:31.050 --> 32:32.470]  And then I gotta make sure I do the rune.
[32:33.070 --> 32:34.290]  Can't forget the rune.
[32:35.570 --> 32:38.670]  And now maybe this time he won't immediately attack us.
[32:41.430 --> 32:41.890]  Nope.
[32:42.710 --> 32:44.230]  He sure is gonna get in there.
[32:44.650 --> 32:45.350]  That's fine.
[32:46.310 --> 32:47.270]  That's how it goes.
[32:47.470 --> 32:48.170]  That's how it goes.
[32:52.010 --> 32:53.330]  Ah, the second heal's thrown.
[32:53.530 --> 32:54.270]  Okay, lock back in.
[32:54.350 --> 32:54.570]  Nope.
[32:55.590 --> 32:57.490]  That really just fucked up my whole timing.
[32:59.410 --> 33:00.550]  Is it me, is it me, is it me?
[33:00.550 --> 33:00.890]  It is me.
[33:01.270 --> 33:01.910]  Oh, man.
[33:02.110 --> 33:02.350]  Okay.
[33:03.510 --> 33:04.570]  Not a great start.
[33:05.790 --> 33:08.550]  Not a great start, but that just means tons of room for improvement.
[33:09.210 --> 33:10.090]  We can win this back.
[33:10.170 --> 33:10.870]  We can get this back.
[33:11.050 --> 33:11.550]  Right here.
[33:12.350 --> 33:12.670]  Nope.
[33:13.770 --> 33:14.550]  I'm just off.
[33:17.150 --> 33:19.870]  But it would be very me if the one where I'm off is the one where we get it.
[33:21.370 --> 33:22.570]  We're not out of the fight.
[33:22.950 --> 33:24.270]  He's still just dancing around.
[33:24.350 --> 33:24.870]  He's clinking.
[33:25.510 --> 33:27.110]  He's throwing stuff left and right.
[33:27.250 --> 33:28.750]  Did I forget to spawn my man?
[33:29.250 --> 33:31.070]  I forgot to spawn my man, didn't I?
[33:32.090 --> 33:34.870]  Oh, this has just been a disaster of a run from the beginning.
[33:39.850 --> 33:41.170]  So far, not bad though.
[33:43.870 --> 33:45.890]  Maybe it's because I don't have my man?
[33:46.510 --> 33:47.590]  It's a damage thing?
[33:50.310 --> 33:52.730]  Um, I'm gonna get fucking blasted.
[33:52.730 --> 33:53.650]  Yep.
[33:55.830 --> 33:56.350]  Yep.
[33:57.010 --> 33:57.430]  Heal.
[33:58.530 --> 33:59.050]  Yeah.
[34:01.350 --> 34:03.350]  I just don't know what to do when that happens.
[34:04.850 --> 34:06.710]  Yeah, cool for you, man.
[34:06.890 --> 34:07.690]  Cool, cool.
[34:08.170 --> 34:08.490]  Cool.
[34:09.010 --> 34:09.470]  Dude.
[34:09.650 --> 34:10.270]  Hey, dude.
[34:10.890 --> 34:11.990]  You're pretty cool.
[34:15.630 --> 34:18.550]  I like Danzac, but maybe it's not worth having him on this field.
[34:19.630 --> 34:21.970]  Maybe the move is...
[34:21.970 --> 34:24.730]  Just keep chunking, keep chunking, keep chunking, keep chunking.
[34:25.190 --> 34:26.670]  Chunk when I can, chunk when I can.
[34:26.750 --> 34:26.970]  Heal.
[34:27.710 --> 34:29.130]  Run, run, run.
[34:29.510 --> 34:31.190]  Fucking Nasus is being thrown at me.
[34:31.470 --> 34:32.410]  Deep space nine.
[34:32.830 --> 34:33.910]  Deep space nine!
[34:34.270 --> 34:34.710]  Okay.
[34:35.490 --> 34:35.890]  Get in.
[34:36.490 --> 34:38.290]  Hit him in the fucking ankle.
[34:39.650 --> 34:39.950]  Nope.
[34:40.390 --> 34:40.610]  Nope.
[34:41.790 --> 34:42.230]  Nope.
[34:43.450 --> 34:44.590]  You piece of shit.
[34:44.730 --> 34:45.730]  Heal, heal, heal.
[34:47.270 --> 34:48.150]  Come on, Mimic.
[34:48.250 --> 34:49.390]  Do something, man.
[34:49.730 --> 34:50.390]  There we go.
[34:50.510 --> 34:50.750]  Okay.
[34:50.750 --> 34:51.930]  You do your job.
[34:52.070 --> 34:53.070]  You do your job, Mimic.
[34:53.250 --> 34:53.750]  Good job.
[34:55.710 --> 34:56.150]  Dodge.
[34:56.770 --> 34:57.210]  Dodge.
[34:57.490 --> 34:57.790]  Dodge!
[34:59.670 --> 35:00.550]  Fucking bullshit.
[35:00.990 --> 35:01.730]  Heal, heal, heal.
[35:02.010 --> 35:02.250]  Heal.
[35:02.470 --> 35:02.790]  Heal.
[35:03.090 --> 35:03.410]  Heal.
[35:04.270 --> 35:06.310]  Oh, he's doing, he's going into space.
[35:06.570 --> 35:08.030]  He's the fucking Hubble mode.
[35:08.210 --> 35:09.170]  He's in Hubble mode.
[35:09.510 --> 35:10.170]  Where's the Hubble?
[35:10.450 --> 35:10.650]  Oh!
[35:11.070 --> 35:15.090]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[35:15.410 --> 35:16.550]  Come on, come on, come on.
[35:16.650 --> 35:16.950]  Die.
[35:17.390 --> 35:17.650]  No.
[35:18.190 --> 35:18.830]  Oh, shit.
[35:18.830 --> 35:20.050]  Heal, just heal, just heal.
[35:20.170 --> 35:20.970]  There's nothing I can do about him.
[35:21.430 --> 35:22.050]  He's so low.
[35:22.330 --> 35:23.710]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[35:24.370 --> 35:24.650]  No.
[35:25.250 --> 35:26.170]  Fucking get hit.
[35:26.430 --> 35:27.350]  Get hit by something.
[35:27.710 --> 35:28.810]  Where are you?
[35:29.870 --> 35:31.210]  Where are you?
[35:32.290 --> 35:33.210]  Get him!
[35:33.710 --> 35:34.050]  Yeah!
[35:36.530 --> 35:37.090]  Yeah!
[35:38.030 --> 35:38.950]  Take that!
[35:39.630 --> 35:40.650]  You son of a bitch.
[35:41.330 --> 35:42.130]  God slain.
[35:42.550 --> 35:45.750]  Uh, uh, uh, uh.
[35:46.810 --> 35:47.650]  Oh, my God.
[35:48.490 --> 35:48.890]  Oh!
[35:50.330 --> 35:51.690]  Oh, I didn't need that other guy.
[35:51.790 --> 35:52.810]  That other guy was holding me back.
[35:52.890 --> 35:54.090]  Anzac was holding me back.
[35:54.910 --> 35:55.690]  The loyal knight.
[35:57.050 --> 35:57.850]  Holy shit.
[35:58.930 --> 36:00.310]  Let's get this point of grace.
[36:01.710 --> 36:01.970]  Bah!
[36:03.630 --> 36:04.530]  Oh, wait, what?
[36:05.830 --> 36:06.890]  Are we going to heaven?
[36:07.990 --> 36:09.450]  Is this the end of Lost?
[36:10.730 --> 36:12.630]  Were we in Purgatory the entire time?
[36:15.790 --> 36:19.750]  Are the Wachowskis about to slide out and explain that this is a video game?
[36:22.820 --> 36:23.260]  And...
[36:23.260 --> 36:24.700]  Oh, is this the Smooch lady?
[36:34.420 --> 36:37.720]  You think she knows when the Game of Thrones book is coming out that everyone's waiting for?
[36:39.240 --> 36:42.360]  That thing's been delayed for like seven years, it feels like.
[36:47.210 --> 36:47.650]  No.
[36:50.050 --> 36:51.210]  I don't trust you.
[36:51.270 --> 36:52.730]  Two Smooches and you're killing people.
[36:54.890 --> 36:57.430]  Was it like the Italian thing where you kiss each cheek?
[36:57.550 --> 36:57.990]  They're dead.
[37:01.590 --> 37:02.470]  Dead place.
[37:07.920 --> 37:09.060]  Are we going to get credits?
[37:10.620 --> 37:11.560]  No? Okay.
[37:12.240 --> 37:13.320]  Is the Touch of Grace real?
[37:14.260 --> 37:15.300]  Circlet of Light?
[37:16.760 --> 37:16.980]  Okay.
[37:19.180 --> 37:20.820]  Is there anything else I can do?
[37:21.960 --> 37:23.260]  We done? We do this?
[37:23.320 --> 37:24.440]  I can't believe we did that.
[37:25.520 --> 37:27.220]  And it truly, we did that.
[37:27.220 --> 37:30.600]  Like, I don't think I could have done that without all the help from chat.
[37:31.020 --> 37:32.320]  Is there anything else going on over here?
[37:33.440 --> 37:34.880]  Oh, there's an armor set by the door.
[37:35.000 --> 37:35.860]  Let's go check that out.
[37:37.700 --> 37:39.480]  Let's go see what's going on with that armor set.
[37:43.810 --> 37:44.170]  Crazy.
[37:46.390 --> 37:47.190]  What a game.
[37:49.130 --> 37:49.890]  Oh, here's the Grace.
[37:54.520 --> 37:54.880]  Bam.
[37:56.740 --> 37:58.140]  Lost Grace discovered.
[38:02.020 --> 38:03.140]  Armor by the door.
[38:04.540 --> 38:06.040]  I don't see no armor by the door.
[38:15.920 --> 38:17.700]  Oh, they're doing the Minecraft thing, aren't they?
[38:17.780 --> 38:18.880]  Shit, I wanted to watch that.
[38:19.580 --> 38:22.840]  I'm going to wrap this up so I can go watch that stream.
[38:24.480 --> 38:24.880]  Um...
[38:24.880 --> 38:26.500]  Are they live right now?
[38:30.410 --> 38:31.630]  Oh, the stream is over?
[38:31.990 --> 38:32.610]  Oh, shit.
[38:33.790 --> 38:34.870]  Oh, wait. Is this the armor?
[38:35.890 --> 38:37.290]  No, that's my past death.
[38:38.890 --> 38:39.930]  Is there armor?
[38:48.640 --> 38:50.080]  To the right behind me?
[38:51.480 --> 38:53.460]  I'm fucking... I'm so blind.
[38:53.580 --> 38:55.660]  It is a miracle that I beat this game.
[38:57.420 --> 38:58.520]  To the right.
[39:00.740 --> 39:01.840]  Okay, I'll rest.
[39:02.160 --> 39:03.540]  That's a good call. Let's try that.
[39:06.120 --> 39:07.760]  Just hanging out. I'll level up.
[39:08.940 --> 39:11.380]  Throw some points on dexterity.
[39:11.380 --> 39:15.940]  Oh, there it is.
[39:16.500 --> 39:17.600]  There we go.
[39:21.020 --> 39:23.080]  Oh, how did he die?
[39:23.820 --> 39:25.280]  I left you out of the arena.
[39:26.280 --> 39:27.020]  What happened?
[39:32.890 --> 39:35.310]  Crimson Rhapsody is saying optional boss, that is way harder.
[39:35.470 --> 39:36.150]  Which boss?
[39:40.820 --> 39:42.000]  Which optional boss?
[39:49.060 --> 39:50.800]  Oh, I already killed Bale the Dragon.
[39:52.660 --> 39:55.380]  I got Bale already. We took his ass out.
[39:56.560 --> 39:57.380]  Last night.
[39:58.680 --> 40:01.240]  Where is his grave? Where is that even?
[40:01.840 --> 40:05.540]  Over here? Rest to dread the dragon? We'll go over to his grave site.
[40:06.400 --> 40:07.260]  I can show you this.
[40:09.740 --> 40:11.920]  Jagged peak. Killed this son of a bitch.
[40:14.700 --> 40:16.400]  How do I...
[40:16.400 --> 40:18.680]  Oh, okay. Well, shit.
[40:19.760 --> 40:20.680]  We're going to rest.
[40:29.550 --> 40:32.210]  Thank you so much for watching.
[40:32.390 --> 40:35.710]  How many hours do you put in the DLC? Probably like 30 or 40.
[40:36.430 --> 40:37.190]  Somewhere in that range.
[40:41.090 --> 40:42.410]  I'm pretty sure I killed everyone.
[40:42.490 --> 40:44.190]  Is there like a...
[40:47.160 --> 40:49.220]  Is there a flower thing in the swamp?
[40:49.500 --> 40:50.520]  Like a boss flower?
[40:50.960 --> 40:53.260]  I think that's the only thing I may not have killed.
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.320]  There's a sunflower boss at the top. Okay.
[41:01.720 --> 41:02.340]  Top right?
[41:07.950 --> 41:09.110]  Where do I go for that one?
[41:13.880 --> 41:15.440]  Almost jinxing is the keyword.
[41:21.900 --> 41:23.960]  No, that little brown patch at the top.
[41:24.140 --> 41:26.380]  Oh, up in here?
[41:27.860 --> 41:29.700]  Right here? Where I'm circling?
[41:32.180 --> 41:33.320]  How do I get there?
[41:33.600 --> 41:34.640]  Let's go kill this guy.
[41:34.640 --> 41:34.740]  Okay.
[41:42.200 --> 41:43.440]  Shadowkeep Churchgrace. Okay.
[41:46.380 --> 41:47.220]  Shadowkeep Backgate?
[41:48.720 --> 41:50.320]  This one? Shadowkeep Backgate?
[41:56.300 --> 41:58.160]  Relying on you, chat, because I am blind.
[41:59.260 --> 42:01.660]  I'm going to assume y'all mean to Shadowkeep Backgate.
[42:01.780 --> 42:02.640]  Unless there's a different one.
[42:03.060 --> 42:03.880]  Close enough? Okay.
[42:12.170 --> 42:13.470]  So now where do we go from here?
[42:15.590 --> 42:16.950]  Nope, that's wrong.
[42:17.370 --> 42:18.770]  There's a church north.
[42:22.590 --> 42:24.710]  Did you drain the water near Shadowkeep?
[42:24.810 --> 42:26.730]  I don't think so. The church.
[42:27.670 --> 42:28.570]  Church, okay.
[42:30.110 --> 42:31.370]  Oh, like this church?
[42:34.390 --> 42:35.770]  Below that grace.
[42:37.830 --> 42:38.910]  So this one?
[42:42.050 --> 42:43.850]  Church District at Shadowkeep.
[42:43.850 --> 42:44.970]  At Shadowkeep.
[42:49.340 --> 42:50.240]  Shadowkeep Main Gate?
[42:53.140 --> 42:54.720]  This must be so infuriating.
[42:54.840 --> 42:55.900]  I'm sorry, I'm trying my best here.
[42:57.320 --> 42:58.280]  This one?
[43:00.140 --> 43:00.680]  This entrance?
[43:02.680 --> 43:05.680]  I think I got it. There we go.
[43:06.860 --> 43:07.800]  And what do I gotta do in here?
[43:12.390 --> 43:15.030]  Now you gotta go across and drown the water.
[43:17.130 --> 43:17.590]  Drain.
[43:18.550 --> 43:19.750]  How do I drain it though?
[43:20.090 --> 43:21.830]  Because I've hopped all through here.
[43:30.100 --> 43:32.120]  Is there like a lever I gotta hit or something?
[43:32.220 --> 43:33.360]  I'm just gonna start hopscotching.
[43:35.560 --> 43:36.660]  Start running around.
[43:38.100 --> 43:42.160]  Follow the building tops, go up a broken wall and follow it to an...
[43:42.160 --> 43:43.180]  Okay, it's a lever.
[43:43.700 --> 43:46.020]  So we gotta go up there, I'm assuming.
[43:49.770 --> 43:50.610]  Let's go here.
[43:52.390 --> 43:55.130]  Oh boy. It's a little bit stressful.
[44:00.310 --> 44:01.230]  I'm so bouncy.
[44:03.850 --> 44:05.070]  I don't know how they died.
[44:06.050 --> 44:08.770]  Up here, I'm guessing? Yeah, and then I gotta go...
[44:11.690 --> 44:12.830]  Oh, I hate these guys.
[44:16.950 --> 44:18.930]  I just killed the last boss of the game, you're not gonna get me.
[44:18.930 --> 44:20.770]  You're not gonna get me, I just got the last boss.
[44:21.410 --> 44:22.250]  You ain't getting me.
[44:23.650 --> 44:24.350]  I'm gonna heal.
[44:25.910 --> 44:26.890]  So we go up here.
[44:30.030 --> 44:32.870]  I'm guessing it's the same jump where you go from here to here.
[44:33.830 --> 44:34.850]  And then you go up.
[44:38.350 --> 44:38.710]  Okay.
[44:40.110 --> 44:41.970]  And now from here, where am I looking?
[44:42.130 --> 44:43.710]  Do I just keep going up higher and higher?
[44:43.710 --> 44:44.710]  I can.
[44:46.270 --> 44:47.490]  Is there a lever somewhere over here?
[44:48.910 --> 44:50.370]  Go down there, okay.
[44:52.270 --> 44:53.350]  Like down here?
[44:54.750 --> 44:56.850]  No, down the hole, in the hole, got it, okay.
[44:58.010 --> 45:00.070]  Oh boy, that would've sucked.
[45:01.530 --> 45:02.610]  Let's go around.
[45:05.900 --> 45:06.800]  In the hole.
[45:08.500 --> 45:09.660]  Now where do I go?
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.820]  Forward, left, right.
[45:18.710 --> 45:19.950]  Go to the left.
[45:21.410 --> 45:21.630]  Okay.
[45:25.270 --> 45:27.230]  Yeah, I definitely didn't go this way.
[45:28.070 --> 45:29.150]  That's locked.
[45:32.900 --> 45:35.520]  Is there anything, any switches in here?
[45:36.360 --> 45:37.400]  Fuck you.
[45:40.680 --> 45:41.980]  Okay, just keep going?
[45:42.520 --> 45:42.720]  Okay.
[45:46.560 --> 45:47.400]  In here?
[45:48.460 --> 45:49.020]  No.
[45:57.410 --> 46:02.030]  Oh, I do so much more damage to you handed and I like how fast I'm swinging this.
[46:03.310 --> 46:04.430]  That's very cool.
[46:09.690 --> 46:11.730]  We'll probably do...
[46:11.730 --> 46:13.490]  Okay, go out here now, one of these doors.
[46:14.370 --> 46:16.470]  This'll probably be a VOD at a later time.
[46:17.950 --> 46:19.130]  Let's kill this bat.
[46:23.420 --> 46:25.040]  Lever here, no.
[46:26.800 --> 46:27.460]  Oh.
[46:28.220 --> 46:29.620]  What do we got over there?
[46:33.120 --> 46:35.640]  Oh, that was so lucky.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.740]  That was so lucky, that could've been a problem.
[46:39.680 --> 46:40.080]  Wow.
[46:41.440 --> 46:42.420]  Oh man.
[46:43.340 --> 46:45.300]  Momentum saved my ass.
[46:46.480 --> 46:48.520]  Okay, there's probably something in the land on my head, yeah.
[46:49.860 --> 46:51.660]  I know how Elden Ring works.
[46:54.620 --> 46:55.100]  Yeah.
[46:56.500 --> 46:57.280]  It's there.
[46:58.080 --> 47:00.860]  That feels like they put a secret wall on that side.
[47:06.240 --> 47:08.220]  Oh, okay, let's drain this thing.
[47:11.380 --> 47:14.800]  I was wondering about this, because I noticed there was something swimming in the water here.
[47:33.920 --> 47:35.040]  Oh, hell yeah.
[47:35.760 --> 47:36.840]  Go get that water.
[47:42.300 --> 47:43.740]  Drainin' that sewage.
[48:01.130 --> 48:03.350]  Oh man, that's...
[48:03.350 --> 48:05.150]  It's an ominous tree.
[48:09.570 --> 48:11.030]  Oh, a point of grace?
[48:12.990 --> 48:13.630]  Huh.
[48:15.450 --> 48:17.130]  Can I just dive down there?
[48:18.330 --> 48:19.550]  I wanna get down there.
[48:22.360 --> 48:24.520]  It's probably smart to go down the ladder.
[48:28.910 --> 48:29.550]  Oh.
[48:31.110 --> 48:31.670]  Okay.
[48:33.330 --> 48:34.210]  This works.
[48:35.170 --> 48:36.830]  Let's see what you got for me, buddy.
[48:40.230 --> 48:42.050]  Give me that smithing stone.
[48:44.800 --> 48:45.880]  Give me the grace.
[48:49.290 --> 48:51.450]  Let's see, how many...
[48:52.130 --> 48:52.470]  Rest.
[48:54.070 --> 48:55.310]  Level up, can I level up?
[48:55.490 --> 49:00.310]  I probably have enough things to level up.
[49:01.690 --> 49:04.590]  So let's do that, just so we don't...
[49:05.450 --> 49:06.410]  burn these.
[49:12.330 --> 49:14.550]  Get that dexterity even higher.
[49:18.680 --> 49:19.880]  Oh, it might be close.
[49:26.050 --> 49:27.630]  I think I'll barely have enough.
[49:28.250 --> 49:29.150]  But it might be close.
[49:33.200 --> 49:35.500]  Oh, please don't be just under.
[49:43.300 --> 49:44.860]  Did I do it? Are we good?
[49:46.860 --> 49:47.340]  Yeah!
[49:48.760 --> 49:50.600]  Just barely enough.
[49:52.880 --> 49:54.420]  Love you too, Alpha Kappa.
[49:56.160 --> 49:56.800]  Uh...
[49:57.940 --> 50:00.220]  Okay, so I'm just gonna run out and then
[50:00.220 --> 50:02.040]  go stab a weed or something?
[50:02.680 --> 50:05.460]  Oh! Here's the tree.
[50:07.880 --> 50:09.520]  Oh, it's breaking down!
[50:13.900 --> 50:14.540]  Uh...
[50:15.880 --> 50:17.120]  Is this the boss?
[50:19.040 --> 50:20.820]  Is this the boss, or is this not the boss?
[50:20.900 --> 50:23.560]  This is just a guy, because this could also just be a guy, I guess.
[50:29.640 --> 50:30.720]  Is this not the boss?
[50:31.540 --> 50:32.720]  Oh, it's just the guy, okay.
[50:33.640 --> 50:34.140]  That's fine.
[50:36.340 --> 50:37.660]  We'll get stuff from this guy.
[50:39.340 --> 50:41.680]  Let my stamina heal up a little bit.
[50:43.300 --> 50:44.760]  I don't really care what you're doing to me.
[50:45.980 --> 50:47.580]  I'm just all about getting up in that ass.
[50:47.580 --> 50:49.340]  Getting up in that woody ass.
[50:51.040 --> 50:52.600]  Swinging at those weeds.
[50:54.480 --> 50:55.640]  De-rooting you.
[50:56.380 --> 50:58.220]  Where are you going? Where are you going? You're running from me.
[51:03.650 --> 51:03.950]  Okay.
[51:05.310 --> 51:05.750]  Okay.
[51:08.450 --> 51:11.610]  Man, man, man. I'm gonna slam your tree. Good for you.
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.400]  Get stunned. Get stunned.
[51:18.500 --> 51:20.680]  Come on. You're due for a stunning.
[51:23.960 --> 51:26.180]  Well, that doesn't seem good. Oh, gotcha.
[51:26.340 --> 51:27.640]  There we go, there we go, there we go.
[51:29.360 --> 51:31.900]  Okay, there's apparently two of these things down here, so we got one of them.
[51:35.420 --> 51:37.560]  I'm gonna rest at the sight of Grace, and if he respawns,
[51:38.560 --> 51:40.660]  I will be furious.
[51:46.380 --> 51:47.480]  Do a little rest.
[51:54.570 --> 51:57.250]  Now, let's try to find this guy.
[51:57.250 --> 51:57.910]  Guy.
[52:02.120 --> 52:03.820]  Well pickled turtleneck.
[52:05.320 --> 52:06.320]  Delicious.
[52:12.480 --> 52:13.480]  Hello?
[52:19.120 --> 52:20.460]  Oh, I don't want to fight you.
[52:25.440 --> 52:29.800]  Oh, you're spawning, guys?
[52:31.940 --> 52:32.640]  Okay.
[52:43.110 --> 52:44.630]  Nope. Nope.
[52:45.250 --> 52:48.250]  Wasting my healing that's intended for the boss.
[52:48.870 --> 52:50.290]  Stupid fire guy.
[52:51.650 --> 52:52.570]  Fuck you.
[52:57.800 --> 53:00.240]  Cool, I guess. Death Mask Helm.
[53:01.160 --> 53:02.000]  Let's go through here.
[53:08.050 --> 53:11.130]  Gotta be getting close. This feels kind of like a boss area.
[53:12.060 --> 53:15.050]  Can I open this?
[53:15.950 --> 53:16.370]  Yeah.
[53:18.090 --> 53:20.570]  Gotta love opening doors in Elden Ring.
[53:23.270 --> 53:24.390]  Oh, whoops.
[53:32.280 --> 53:33.480]  Just to be ready.
[53:38.670 --> 53:40.690]  Oh, this is a long lift.
[53:41.650 --> 53:42.760]  Jesus Christ.
[53:44.270 --> 53:45.530]  Was this all water?
[53:47.270 --> 53:48.750]  This is one hell of a bathtub.
[53:48.750 --> 53:53.440]  Oh, here we go.
[53:58.000 --> 53:58.980]  Let's rest.
[54:00.340 --> 54:01.420]  Get back up.
[54:06.240 --> 54:11.060]  I wonder if it just drops me into the fight immediately or if this is a...
[54:11.060 --> 54:12.300]  Okay, well that answers that.
[54:12.520 --> 54:15.660]  That was an accident. That could have went horribly.
[54:18.420 --> 54:19.700]  Oh, there you are.
[54:20.340 --> 54:21.260]  Oh, I see ya.
[54:21.660 --> 54:22.300]  Oh, wait.
[54:23.360 --> 54:26.120]  I thought that was like a weed.
[54:26.880 --> 54:28.200]  What do we got going on over here?
[54:29.900 --> 54:31.580]  Iris of Grace. Okay.
[54:37.850 --> 54:39.050]  Another Point of Grace?
[54:40.150 --> 54:41.270]  This is crazy.
[54:46.420 --> 54:47.520]  Merica's Rune.
[54:48.420 --> 54:49.120]  Oh, here we go.
[54:50.480 --> 54:51.720]  Let's drink this.
[54:53.980 --> 54:57.060]  Is this a summon fight or is this a non-summon fight?
[55:01.370 --> 55:02.750]  Oh, it's a summon fight. Okay.
[55:03.390 --> 55:05.230]  Let's get our buddy out here.
[55:09.050 --> 55:09.490]  Okay.
[55:10.150 --> 55:10.470]  Okay.
[55:12.490 --> 55:13.910]  Let's see what you got going on.
[55:18.560 --> 55:20.400]  Let's chop these roots down.
[55:22.540 --> 55:24.760]  Fucked up looking sunflower, son of a bitch.
[55:26.800 --> 55:28.100]  Oh, you're turning the water all...
[55:28.100 --> 55:29.240]  Oh, actually, that's bad.
[55:31.760 --> 55:33.200]  Oh, this is easy.
[55:33.720 --> 55:36.280]  This is easy work.
[55:37.360 --> 55:39.160]  Oh, I'm chopping you down.
[55:40.620 --> 55:42.540]  Heave ho, heave ho.
[55:43.320 --> 55:45.480]  Death flower won't grow.
[55:47.560 --> 55:48.360]  Heal.
[55:48.760 --> 55:50.260]  Putting down a little finishing blow.
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.840]  Oh, take that.
[55:56.420 --> 55:57.060]  Take that.
[55:57.060 --> 55:59.720]  I don't need no weed killer extreme.
[56:01.980 --> 56:02.760]  Wait, what?
[56:03.400 --> 56:04.080]  Oh, no.
[56:06.620 --> 56:08.020]  Okay, I apologize.
[56:08.940 --> 56:10.940]  I didn't respect the possibility of a second phase.
[56:11.980 --> 56:12.840]  Get over here.
[56:14.660 --> 56:17.640]  Just running all over the goddamn place, making me get to you.
[56:19.020 --> 56:20.900]  Throwing your stupid thorns at me.
[56:25.390 --> 56:26.250]  Get out of here.
[56:28.170 --> 56:30.410]  You're a mid-tier blackberry bush, dude.
[56:30.810 --> 56:32.970]  Those are some mid-tier thorns. Lower tier.
[56:33.430 --> 56:34.490]  Lower tier thorns.
[56:36.470 --> 56:39.810]  I've held roses that are sharper. Okay, that might be an exaggeration.
[56:39.910 --> 56:42.150]  That was blood loss. That was a lot.
[56:42.190 --> 56:45.470]  I can't even get to this guy. I'm just trying to get to you.
[56:46.070 --> 56:47.670]  Trying to bridge the distance here.
[56:50.510 --> 56:53.330]  See, once I get in, you're in trouble.
[56:54.130 --> 56:55.530]  You're just fucked here.
[56:57.090 --> 56:58.970]  I'm just having a little drink because I'm thirsty.
[56:59.090 --> 57:01.350]  I didn't even need that health. I just wanted to quench that thirst.
[57:01.630 --> 57:02.850]  My throat was a little dry.
[57:05.310 --> 57:09.310]  Now we're going to do the stupid, bullshit-ass little thorn attacks.
[57:09.970 --> 57:11.330]  Your goddamn grove.
[57:13.710 --> 57:14.510]  Okay, okay.
[57:16.230 --> 57:17.650]  Well, at least you came back.
[57:18.510 --> 57:20.330]  Didn't make me have to chase you the whole way.
[57:22.210 --> 57:22.770]  Okay.
[57:23.770 --> 57:25.550]  Keep on slicing.
[57:27.370 --> 57:27.630]  Oh.
[57:30.430 --> 57:32.550]  That was a little close. Where's your stupid head?
[57:32.870 --> 57:35.050]  Where's your stupid head? I went the wrong way.
[57:37.030 --> 57:37.590]  Bam!
[57:39.090 --> 57:40.910]  Now it's over, son.
[57:41.150 --> 57:44.310]  Now you're done. Weed killer be gone.
[57:44.830 --> 57:47.810]  Boop boop. Let me E-mode. How do I E-mode on him?
[57:48.290 --> 57:49.950]  How do I? Why are you swinging? No!
[57:51.450 --> 57:52.630]  How many phases?
[57:54.210 --> 57:55.630]  You're just doing the same thing.
[58:03.300 --> 58:05.680]  I mean, we really didn't need to do this again.
[58:06.520 --> 58:08.300]  This is your worst run so far.
[58:10.080 --> 58:11.140]  Now I'm going to heal.
[58:12.300 --> 58:13.540]  I don't want to get too cocky.
[58:18.710 --> 58:19.150]  Bap.
[58:23.690 --> 58:25.310]  No! I got too cocky.
[58:25.310 --> 58:26.850]  I spaced out for a minute.
[58:27.210 --> 58:29.590]  You piece of shit.
[58:30.030 --> 58:31.370]  That was on me.
[58:32.570 --> 58:33.650]  That was on me.
[58:38.070 --> 58:38.670]  Shit.
[58:40.290 --> 58:41.590]  That ain't going to happen again.
[58:44.030 --> 58:45.030]  We got him this time.
[58:46.090 --> 58:48.710]  At least three phases. We'll respect the phases.
[58:53.390 --> 58:54.890]  I feel dumb about that.
[58:54.890 --> 58:55.630]  I should have killed him.
[58:57.770 --> 58:59.350]  We got this on this try.
[59:00.630 --> 59:01.410]  Maybe we don't.
[59:02.450 --> 59:03.410]  Now I'm getting my ass kicked.
[59:06.890 --> 59:08.210]  Now I'm getting my ass kicked.
[59:11.950 --> 59:12.390]  Jesus.
[59:14.370 --> 59:15.570]  Where did this come from?
[59:16.510 --> 59:18.230]  Where did you get good all of a sudden?
[59:20.190 --> 59:22.250]  It's actually more likely that I just...
[59:22.250 --> 59:25.310]  My badness is front to surface.
[59:25.830 --> 59:26.830]  Blood loss.
[59:28.450 --> 59:30.890]  I mean, doesn't every strike have blood loss?
[59:30.990 --> 59:32.910]  I get what they mean. It's a build up thing.
[59:35.330 --> 59:36.990]  I'm getting stabbed constantly.
[59:40.050 --> 59:40.890]  Fuck you.
[59:41.770 --> 59:42.970]  Let's just get to this phase.
[59:43.250 --> 59:44.250]  That did a lot of damage.
[59:46.210 --> 59:47.050]  Phase two.
[59:53.930 --> 59:55.450]  Where are you at? Where are you going to spawn?
[59:56.570 --> 59:57.230]  Where are you spawning?
[59:58.170 --> 59:59.130]  Right here.
[01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:02.670]  As expected.
[01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:06.710]  Does damage on the way up.
[01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.370]  He's going to do a stupid... I hate this so much.
[01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.790]  That stupid slide.
[01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.950]  That's probably real bad.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.200]  We're in.
[01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:29.530]  Okay.
[01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.110]  I didn't even get to third phase that time.
[01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:37.110]  I gotta respect the plan.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.470]  I'm just not respecting it.
[01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.150]  And that's the problem. I need to treat this like it's Radon.
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.260]  We're treating this like we're Radon.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.040]  We're going to kill this boss right here.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.060]  And then we're going to call it for the night.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.160]  And I thank you so much for watching.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.120]  And I can even pop one of my runes, I guess.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.360]  I don't know why I'm not doing that. I just kind of forgot they existed.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.680]  I guess if I really wanted to take this seriously, I'd respec all my talismans and stuff.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.380]  That's fine. We're going to get this guy.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.120]  We almost got him on the first try.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.960]  Oh, the face does a lot of damage.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.420]  That's where I should be hitting, I guess.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.020]  I forgot my guy.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.000]  I forgot my summon.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.260]  See, I'm not locked in.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.800]  If I was locked in, I wouldn't forget my buddy.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.640]  You know what? We're going to keep him on ice right now.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:51.620]  And then he's going to be so fucking surprised when we finish this in two phases.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.060]  He's going to be expecting a third phase.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:54.960]  He's going to be like, what happened?
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.340]  We've done this before. This guy has three phases. What did you do?
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.480]  I'll be like, I did the first phase without you.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:02.940]  Pranked you.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280]  And stab him.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.120]  Get him going, and then he's going to go down.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.540]  And then let's ring my little dinner bell.
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.560]  Now he's thinking, okay, we're getting ready to fight this guy.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.680]  First time.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.200]  He's got no idea. What a prank.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.800]  Do your little shimmy back.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.800]  Or not.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.080]  Dodge, dodge.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.480]  Go, go, go, go.
[01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.870]  Heal. Heal. Heal.
[01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:55.710]  Heal.
[01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:06.950]  Heal. I really got to heal. Really got to heal.
[01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.630]  Really got to heal.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.660]  Okay. That was stupid of me to run into it.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.780]  Even dumber to run up to his face and just whiff three times.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:26.780]  That's okay.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.680]  Heal, and then we're going to get this to phase three.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.580]  The final phase.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.540]  Or in the eyes of my mimic,
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.100]  phase two.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.720]  Okay. Get you, get you, get you, get you.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.500]  Cutting you up, cutting you up, cutting you up.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.380]  Oh, that was a huge mistake by you. What a tactical error.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.140]  Oh.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.880]  Okay. Just heal, heal.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.840]  Oh my God. Heal. Let me heal, let me heal.
[01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:12.870]  I mean, huge mistake on the avatar's part.
[01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:17.190]  Eyes. Oh my God.
[01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:21.750]  Get you, get you. Yeah!
[01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:25.350]  Bam!
[01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.610]  Take that, sunflower.
[01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:30.990]  What a time.
[01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.870]  What a great victory. Thank you so much.
[01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:36.730]  That's it.
[01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:39.610]  Those are the bosses.
[01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:42.810]  This was so much fun. I couldn't have done it without you.
[01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:46.650]  I can't believe I am now done with this DLC. What a time.
[01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.190]  We'll be back with a normal stream on Friday.
[01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:52.970]  We're going to have a, if you are
[01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:56.390]  one of our Patreon members in the Falcon tier, I'm going to write a post
[01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.270]  probably tomorrow explaining about how
[01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:02.210]  if you're Falcon and up, you can join us for
[01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:05.170]  AAPW Wrestling Watch Along on Saturday.
[01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:06.730]  I'm going to be there.
[01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.670]  I don't think Geoff is. I don't know who else is going to be there.
[01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:13.310]  Eric is going to be at the event providing actual commentary.
[01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.690]  If you're watching this as a VOD, I'm sorry you missed it.
[01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.390]  Maybe you can catch the next community event that we do.
[01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:23.490]  If you just happen to be watching this, feel free to check us out
[01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:25.430]  at the Regulation Podcast.
[01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:28.850]  Thank you so much for watching. I love you all so much.
[01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:31.590]  I hope you have a fantastic rest of your night.
[01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:33.010]  Goodbye.
