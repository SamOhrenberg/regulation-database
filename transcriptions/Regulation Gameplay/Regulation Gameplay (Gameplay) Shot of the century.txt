[00:00.000 --> 00:02.020]  Okay, who's taking out the helicopter?
[00:02.480 --> 00:03.160]  I got it.
[00:03.260 --> 00:05.980]  Okay, so the rest of us will focus on everything else, I guess.
[00:06.840 --> 00:07.380]  I got a plan.
[00:08.300 --> 00:09.160]  Oh, God.
[00:09.560 --> 00:10.180]  Oh, Andrew.
[00:13.600 --> 00:14.120]  Well...
[00:14.120 --> 00:15.420]  Rockets cost money, Andrew.
[00:17.360 --> 00:18.160]  Oh, God.
[00:19.160 --> 00:20.100]  He got... Okay.
[00:20.360 --> 00:21.060]  He's dead.
[00:21.340 --> 00:22.100]  What happened?
[00:22.800 --> 00:23.620]  Who did that?
[00:23.960 --> 00:25.220]  The truck was destroyed?
[00:25.660 --> 00:26.240]  Who did that?
[00:26.540 --> 00:27.780]  Andrew, what did you do?
[00:27.980 --> 00:29.080]  I didn't do anything.
[00:29.080 --> 00:29.960]  Who did that?
[00:30.220 --> 00:31.220]  Did you blow the truck up?
[00:31.220 --> 00:32.400]  I shot... I shot the chopper.
[00:32.680 --> 00:34.260]  It landed on the truck.
[00:40.450 --> 00:40.890]  Yes!
[00:42.190 --> 00:45.170]  I was trying to hop in the back of it as it was driving by.
[00:45.270 --> 00:47.890]  I didn't do anything to it, and then everything exploded.
[00:49.130 --> 00:50.130]  What a shock.
[00:53.190 --> 00:54.070]  That's incredible.
[00:54.450 --> 00:55.410]  That was insane.
[00:55.930 --> 00:56.770]  I think that was awesome.
