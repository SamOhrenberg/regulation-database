[00:00.000 --> 00:00.700]  And we're live!
[00:01.240 --> 00:02.780]  Thank you guys so much.
[00:02.840 --> 00:04.560]  We got a code to play this game.
[00:04.640 --> 00:07.200]  We want to thank the people who gave us the code.
[00:07.340 --> 00:08.140]  Thank you so much.
[00:08.580 --> 00:08.940]  TriBand!
[00:09.220 --> 00:10.940]  What? Oh, TriBand.
[00:11.260 --> 00:12.260]  Oh, thanks, TriBand.
[00:13.480 --> 00:14.880]  Yeah. Thank you so much.
[00:15.320 --> 00:16.160]  I'm excited to see this.
[00:16.400 --> 00:18.320]  I told you at the beginning I wanted to do this intro.
[00:18.440 --> 00:19.760]  I don't know why you took it out from under me.
[00:20.280 --> 00:21.860]  Oh, you didn't say you wanted to.
[00:21.940 --> 00:22.440]  You did it.
[00:22.480 --> 00:24.900]  And then I said, I could do it because I want to make sure to thank the people
[00:24.900 --> 00:25.580]  that sent the code.
[00:25.820 --> 00:29.060]  Oh, yeah. And that would be TriBand, Andrew.
[00:29.060 --> 00:29.780]  That would be TriBand.
[00:30.220 --> 00:30.620]  TriBand!
[00:31.480 --> 00:31.800]  Jeez.
[00:32.040 --> 00:33.460]  Thank you, TriBand.
[00:34.120 --> 00:34.620]  Love car.
[00:35.880 --> 00:36.140]  Let's play.
[00:36.180 --> 00:37.480]  Hello, TriBand.
[00:37.520 --> 00:39.660]  The sign that says love car.
[00:40.060 --> 00:41.520]  Oh, I thought that was the name of the game.
[00:41.600 --> 00:42.460]  We should say the name of the game.
[00:43.160 --> 00:44.500]  What the car?
[00:45.040 --> 00:45.780]  What the car?
[00:46.100 --> 00:48.100]  And thanks to TriBand for giving us the code.
[00:48.700 --> 00:51.840]  Did you make the teddy bear spin in the chair like that or did it just automatically do that?
[00:51.840 --> 00:53.060]  What the...
[00:53.060 --> 00:54.000]  He did that on his own.
[00:54.240 --> 00:55.860]  Whoa, Sib, 25 gifted.
[00:56.080 --> 00:57.340]  Thanks, Sib. Appreciate you.
[00:57.440 --> 00:58.300]  Thank you so much.
[00:58.300 --> 00:59.600]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:00.740 --> 01:01.460]  That's a burp.
[01:01.600 --> 01:02.840]  That's a thank you.
[01:02.860 --> 01:03.920]  Yeah, thanks, man.
[01:03.940 --> 01:04.480]  All right.
[01:04.520 --> 01:04.980]  Thanks, everyone.
[01:04.980 --> 01:05.740]  That's the burp.
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.120]  Thanks, everyone watching live.
[01:07.200 --> 01:08.120]  You're watching this on Tuesday.
[01:08.200 --> 01:10.080]  We stream every Friday at 4 p.m. Central.
[01:10.300 --> 01:14.000]  So we can take it to 5.01, the best time of the week.
[01:14.740 --> 01:16.040]  All right. This is car. Go, car, go.
[01:16.740 --> 01:17.020]  Go!
[01:18.080 --> 01:19.480]  Nick is playing this game.
[01:19.560 --> 01:22.400]  I know there's no name burn and some people would be upset about that,
[01:22.520 --> 01:24.640]  but they aren't here, so we didn't put it.
[01:24.640 --> 01:28.860]  Uh, this is Nick is controlling a car with legs.
[01:28.920 --> 01:29.980]  Nick, how does it feel?
[01:30.440 --> 01:33.040]  But how do you know it's Nick if you can't see his name?
[01:33.160 --> 01:33.640]  That's true.
[01:34.120 --> 01:35.560]  Yeah, you might get too confused.
[01:37.880 --> 01:39.100]  Is it only Nick?
[01:40.500 --> 01:41.500]  It's only Nick.
[01:41.920 --> 01:42.440]  It's only Nick.
[01:42.440 --> 01:43.760]  Is that switching between Eric and Nick?
[01:44.060 --> 01:46.160]  Yeah, I'm confused now.
[01:47.380 --> 01:49.280]  Because Eric and Nick are both talking.
[01:49.660 --> 01:50.120]  Right.
[01:50.900 --> 01:51.740]  But now you're talking.
[01:51.880 --> 01:53.240]  Are you driving the car?
[01:53.240 --> 01:54.520]  I think I'm next.
[01:54.580 --> 01:55.020]  Okay.
[01:57.220 --> 02:00.700]  So this is by the same people, I think, that did What the Golf?
[02:00.860 --> 02:03.160]  And it's very much in this style of like,
[02:03.260 --> 02:04.220]  Oh, God, the bear!
[02:04.640 --> 02:10.000]  Where it's like, oh, this is this is like an insane take on what this style of game should be.
[02:10.780 --> 02:11.760]  It's a lot of fun.
[02:11.940 --> 02:12.660]  This is very cool.
[02:12.880 --> 02:16.960]  Oh, I wonder what their next What the Game is going to be.
[02:17.580 --> 02:18.400]  I don't know.
[02:19.240 --> 02:21.780]  I wouldn't have thought car would be...
[02:21.780 --> 02:24.440]  I would say What the Grocery Cart?
[02:24.680 --> 02:27.980]  And you navigate a giant indoor grocery store and shopping mall.
[02:28.260 --> 02:28.840]  Banana car.
[02:29.320 --> 02:30.200]  Let's never split.
[02:31.200 --> 02:32.820]  Oh, I hate that.
[02:33.160 --> 02:35.220]  Oh, is this the Poimals book?
[02:37.720 --> 02:42.120]  Celestial Glorbosis of Peace and Poimals available on Amazon today.
[02:42.780 --> 02:45.620]  Yeah, $2.99 and free on Amazon Unlimited.
[02:46.060 --> 02:48.620]  If you don't want to read it, go listen to Clutch My Pearls.
[02:48.680 --> 02:50.780]  They will read it for you and then you don't have to see it.
[02:50.780 --> 02:55.280]  What? Or they could read it for you and then you could buy it yourself.
[02:55.480 --> 02:56.860]  What? This is awesome.
[02:59.480 --> 02:59.780]  All right.
[03:01.960 --> 03:05.900]  This is how me, Gus and Geoff used to get around when we did Anmo.
[03:06.820 --> 03:07.900]  That's how we are today.
[03:08.020 --> 03:08.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:08.760 --> 03:11.100]  I heard that this is why Cleopatra bankrupted Hollywood.
[03:12.060 --> 03:15.860]  I would say this when the RT budget started to go down a little bit at the end.
[03:18.240 --> 03:19.360]  Wait, hang on.
[03:19.920 --> 03:21.140]  Catch your friends.
[03:21.320 --> 03:24.080]  What? Oh, get him.
[03:29.940 --> 03:33.260]  I think that that's what this gameplay is going to be like, is us
[03:33.260 --> 03:35.200]  just going, huh, over and over again.
[03:36.200 --> 03:38.240]  Hulk, if you like bears, I love him.
[03:38.520 --> 03:40.260]  Oh, yeah, he's pretty cool.
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.760]  This is the type of character that people will get tattooed on them.
[03:44.860 --> 03:45.760]  Is this bear in a hat?
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.600]  Oh, 100%.
[03:47.220 --> 03:48.460]  Not the car with legs?
[03:48.460 --> 03:50.400]  No, I think he's too twisted.
[03:50.720 --> 03:51.300]  Let's do it.
[03:51.340 --> 03:54.200]  You know, I could get a car with legs tattooed.
[03:54.220 --> 03:55.660]  I'm like, I'm in the market for some new tattoos.
[03:55.860 --> 03:56.960]  You are in the market for some new tattoos.
[03:56.960 --> 03:57.840]  This could be a contender.
[03:58.260 --> 04:00.280]  You got some new, you got some big ideas, so.
[04:02.480 --> 04:03.140]  This is exciting.
[04:03.340 --> 04:04.780]  I stepped on a squeaky hot dog toy.
[04:04.880 --> 04:05.560]  Oh, hot dogs.
[04:07.840 --> 04:09.360]  Someone's going to post that on the subreddit
[04:09.360 --> 04:10.680]  just because it's a picture of a hot dog.
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.500]  I got to say, man, out of all the stuff that all the eras we've
[04:15.800 --> 04:17.980]  had through the course of fuckface and regulation,
[04:17.980 --> 04:20.860]  nothing has ever hit harder than hot dogs.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.780]  Who would have thought that hot dog would have been the move?
[04:24.240 --> 04:26.460]  The blue apple out of the water, dude.
[04:26.640 --> 04:27.720]  Yeah, the people love it, dude.
[04:28.560 --> 04:29.240]  Triband presents.
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.840]  Oh, Triband, they gave us the coat.
[04:30.920 --> 04:32.620]  Thank you so much, Triband, for the coat.
[04:33.180 --> 04:36.040]  As as we were saying earlier, we really appreciate it.
[04:36.780 --> 04:38.460]  Whoa. It's you know what?
[04:38.480 --> 04:40.280]  My favorite band is a Triband.
[04:40.400 --> 04:41.500]  Triband, three of them, baby.
[04:42.100 --> 04:45.020]  Dude, this. OK, I'm I'm really like for this bear.
[04:45.140 --> 04:46.100]  I think he's really cool.
[04:46.160 --> 04:46.940]  The bear is great.
[04:46.940 --> 04:49.820]  Yeah. Who's your who's your favorite three person band, Eric?
[04:50.480 --> 04:55.420]  Oh, wow. Man, that's really hard.
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.660]  It's a tough one, isn't it?
[04:56.700 --> 04:57.900]  There's so many there.
[04:58.040 --> 05:01.680]  Yeah. And it's also a thing where it's like I don't immediately think of
[05:01.680 --> 05:03.180]  what's a three person band.
[05:03.260 --> 05:04.100]  I guess so.
[05:04.300 --> 05:10.740]  There's a there's a band called Sultans out of San Diego that I'm a huge fan of.
[05:10.800 --> 05:12.800]  OK. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah.
[05:13.760 --> 05:16.500]  Nick or Andrew, any any Tribands come to mind?
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.660]  None. Uh, not off the top of my head.
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.740]  No, I would say I would.
[05:21.820 --> 05:24.300]  I'm surprised somebody picked like Green Day or Blink-182 or something.
[05:24.420 --> 05:28.420]  But the one that comes to mind for me, and I think it's just because
[05:28.420 --> 05:33.720]  it was such a weird conglomeration to be three people would be the band Morphine.
[05:34.540 --> 05:35.680]  OK, that's pretty cool.
[05:36.100 --> 05:37.760]  They're not a band anymore because that guy died.
[05:37.760 --> 05:41.760]  But they were a three person band with a with like a stand up base
[05:41.760 --> 05:43.520]  and a saxophone. That's like not the.
[05:44.400 --> 05:45.140]  That's pretty cool.
[05:45.240 --> 05:51.540]  Oh, I would say, you know, who else is on there for me is Violent Femmes.
[05:51.860 --> 05:53.460]  Oh, yeah, that's a great, great choice.
[05:53.780 --> 05:55.240]  Great, great three person band there.
[05:55.360 --> 05:57.120]  Come on, Nick, you got to hit that. Let's go, dude.
[05:57.940 --> 05:59.420]  Oh, you landed on them.
[05:59.500 --> 06:01.480]  No, the same.
[06:01.820 --> 06:03.540]  All right. We're learning. We're learning.
[06:03.920 --> 06:05.180]  I think you got to hit the other one.
[06:05.460 --> 06:06.600]  Somebody said Primus.
[06:07.020 --> 06:09.140]  Oh, fuck Genesis. That's a great one.
[06:09.640 --> 06:11.900]  Yeah, I think Primus is a really good one too.
[06:12.600 --> 06:16.000]  Stop doing the exact same thing every time.
[06:16.380 --> 06:18.140]  Pick one of the things to do.
[06:18.620 --> 06:20.680]  Genesis wasn't always a three person band.
[06:20.860 --> 06:23.280]  I think in the 70s, they were a five person band. Yes.
[06:25.080 --> 06:26.580]  Nailed it. There you go.
[06:26.700 --> 06:27.680]  See, you got this, Nick.
[06:28.040 --> 06:28.960]  Nick, you got this.
[06:29.540 --> 06:32.640]  See how you changed up one aspect of that whole thing and it worked out.
[06:32.940 --> 06:34.720]  We, we, oh no, bears!
[06:34.720 --> 06:36.520]  Look out, bears!
[06:40.620 --> 06:43.180]  ZZ Top, Sublime, Hall of Notes.
[06:44.140 --> 06:46.640]  Is Sublime a three person band?
[06:47.420 --> 06:48.300]  I didn't know that.
[06:48.500 --> 06:49.420]  Is who a three person band?
[06:49.740 --> 06:50.720]  Sublime. I thought they had...
[06:50.720 --> 06:52.600]  I think so. No, they were three. Yeah.
[06:52.620 --> 06:56.920]  I mean, like, like, but that's like Nirvana is three, but it's always like...
[06:57.560 --> 06:59.600]  But they always had Pat Smear hanging out back there.
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.740]  Yeah. You know what I mean?
[07:00.780 --> 07:02.960]  Like, it's like, I guess technically
[07:04.520 --> 07:05.440]  that's why you want to do that.
[07:05.520 --> 07:07.080]  Oh, you got to get that, Nick. You got to get that.
[07:07.160 --> 07:07.860]  Oh, I got to get that.
[07:07.900 --> 07:08.500]  You have to.
[07:09.340 --> 07:10.300]  Oh, you got...
[07:10.300 --> 07:12.480]  TriBand gave us the code so you can get that, dude.
[07:12.480 --> 07:13.180]  There you go.
[07:14.140 --> 07:14.780]  Thanks, TriBand.
[07:14.900 --> 07:15.900]  OK. Top.
[07:16.640 --> 07:20.460]  Some people would say TriBand is the ZZ Top of game developers.
[07:20.600 --> 07:21.420]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[07:21.780 --> 07:22.480]  Look out, bears!
[07:23.380 --> 07:24.640]  How does it control, Nick?
[07:24.640 --> 07:25.260]  How do you like it?
[07:25.960 --> 07:28.260]  Weird. You do a lot of A in this.
[07:28.340 --> 07:29.360]  A makes the rocket go.
[07:29.460 --> 07:32.940]  You can do a quick jump or you can hold it to go a little further.
[07:32.940 --> 07:33.980]  That's fun.
[07:34.540 --> 07:37.220]  And then to move this character, you actually have to hold...
[07:37.220 --> 07:38.200]  Oh, we have to see what that is.
[07:38.300 --> 07:39.940]  That looks like a level editor or something.
[07:40.940 --> 07:42.240]  Player made levels.
[07:42.480 --> 07:42.600]  OK.
[07:43.500 --> 07:44.720]  Do we want to...
[07:44.720 --> 07:45.000]  Nope.
[07:45.180 --> 07:45.580]  No.
[07:45.680 --> 07:46.200]  Just keep going.
[07:46.540 --> 07:48.800]  Why would I ever want to see what players have to do?
[07:49.120 --> 07:50.840]  They're playing the game, so am I.
[07:51.800 --> 07:52.120]  What?
[07:52.240 --> 07:53.020]  This is Mario Maker?
[07:53.020 --> 07:54.760]  This isn't out yet, so...
[07:54.760 --> 07:55.340]  I don't think it makes sense.
[07:55.900 --> 07:57.880]  Car with very large legs.
[07:58.860 --> 07:59.680]  This is...
[07:59.680 --> 07:59.820]  Oh!
[08:00.040 --> 08:00.420]  Whoa!
[08:01.680 --> 08:02.160]  This is crazy.
[08:02.160 --> 08:04.100]  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[08:05.240 --> 08:06.140]  There we go!
[08:06.420 --> 08:09.300]  I love that the legs correlate to how high you can jump.
[08:09.600 --> 08:11.320]  You know what you look like right now, Nick?
[08:11.380 --> 08:13.980]  You look like Ludacris throwing out the first pitch last time.
[08:14.880 --> 08:16.340]  Hell yeah, big time, dude.
[08:16.740 --> 08:17.180]  Absolutely.
[08:18.560 --> 08:19.000]  Yeah.
[08:20.560 --> 08:21.000]  Yeah!
[08:22.180 --> 08:22.680]  Way to go.
[08:22.900 --> 08:23.340]  Cool hat.
[08:23.540 --> 08:24.100]  Thanks, man.
[08:25.160 --> 08:25.600]  Wow.
[08:25.920 --> 08:26.980]  This kind of rocks.
[08:27.340 --> 08:28.160]  What a crown.
[08:28.380 --> 08:28.580]  This game is fun.
[08:28.740 --> 08:29.640]  Yeah, this game is really cool.
[08:29.800 --> 08:31.980]  Can you go talk to those bears on the right?
[08:32.280 --> 08:33.020]  Oh, let's find out.
[08:33.640 --> 08:33.920]  Bears?
[08:34.880 --> 08:35.760]  Can you run into them?
[08:35.840 --> 08:35.980]  No.
[08:36.140 --> 08:36.280]  No.
[08:36.400 --> 08:37.320]  Oh, look at his long legs.
[08:37.900 --> 08:38.960]  That bear has very long legs.
[08:39.120 --> 08:39.980]  That bear has huge legs.
[08:40.080 --> 08:40.420]  That's fun.
[08:40.480 --> 08:41.040]  Okay, I won't let it...
[08:41.040 --> 08:41.240]  Yeah.
[08:41.920 --> 08:42.780]  I'm coming back for you, bear.
[08:43.080 --> 08:46.160]  Yeah, this seems like a game where there's gonna be a ton of hidden stuff throughout it
[08:46.160 --> 08:47.760]  where it's like, oh, you didn't walk over here?
[08:47.880 --> 08:49.080]  This is where the crazy area is.
[08:50.340 --> 08:50.900]  Oh, no.
[08:51.140 --> 08:51.800]  Tiny legs.
[08:51.960 --> 08:52.520]  Tiny little baby.
[08:52.600 --> 08:52.920]  Here we go.
[08:53.100 --> 08:54.320]  You see that thing up there on the left?
[08:54.480 --> 08:55.180]  You gotta go get that.
[08:55.340 --> 08:56.160]  Oh, I do, yeah.
[08:56.340 --> 08:56.960]  How are you gonna get that?
[08:57.300 --> 08:57.800]  Yeah, but how?
[08:58.560 --> 08:59.320]  Oh, you gotta...
[08:59.320 --> 09:01.160]  Oh, I see.
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.200]  You got another...
[09:02.840 --> 09:03.680]  So you gotta go left.
[09:03.800 --> 09:04.280]  You gotta go left.
[09:04.320 --> 09:05.600]  Hook a hard left here.
[09:05.960 --> 09:06.700]  Yep, there you go.
[09:06.820 --> 09:07.060]  There you go.
[09:07.200 --> 09:07.520]  Nice.
[09:07.900 --> 09:08.460]  Look at you.
[09:08.580 --> 09:08.920]  Look, Nick.
[09:08.980 --> 09:09.380]  Look at you.
[09:10.700 --> 09:12.460]  Here's what happens when the car has tiny legs, dude.
[09:12.500 --> 09:12.960]  This is good.
[09:14.100 --> 09:14.420]  Boom.
[09:14.700 --> 09:15.220]  Got it.
[09:15.220 --> 09:15.380]  Boom.
[09:15.420 --> 09:16.020]  Nailed it.
[09:16.680 --> 09:16.960]  Easy.
[09:17.040 --> 09:17.620]  Out of the way, bears.
[09:18.240 --> 09:18.460]  Go.
[09:20.740 --> 09:21.360]  Oh, no.
[09:21.520 --> 09:22.100]  Oh, no.
[09:22.340 --> 09:22.600]  You ran...
[09:22.600 --> 09:23.320]  You are...
[09:23.320 --> 09:23.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:23.960 --> 09:24.300]  All right.
[09:24.500 --> 09:26.020]  Nick's starting to get, like, aggro.
[09:26.380 --> 09:27.480]  He's taking up the bloodlust.
[09:28.000 --> 09:28.120]  Yeah.
[09:28.760 --> 09:30.000]  Oh, I'm not supposed to hit the bears.
[09:30.720 --> 09:31.840]  Yeah, I think you're not...
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.100]  I think you're supposed to be bear-aware.
[09:33.460 --> 09:34.240]  And I think you're not supposed to hit...
[09:34.240 --> 09:34.900]  But why...
[09:34.900 --> 09:35.940]  Yeah, be bear-aware.
[09:36.320 --> 09:36.480]  Yeah.
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.240]  Remember the signs?
[09:37.780 --> 09:39.180]  Oh, this is some smoky propaganda.
[09:41.880 --> 09:43.180]  All right, let's try this.
[09:43.200 --> 09:43.580]  What do we...
[09:43.580 --> 09:45.620]  I love being shot...
[09:46.980 --> 09:49.340]  The car would jump with too much.
[09:51.440 --> 09:52.920]  I love the way...
[09:52.920 --> 09:54.320]  Like, the...
[09:54.320 --> 09:54.960]  The dialect.
[09:55.220 --> 09:56.820]  Like, the way things are spoken in this game.
[09:56.900 --> 09:57.480]  It's very funny.
[09:57.660 --> 09:58.480]  It's very...
[09:58.480 --> 09:59.840]  It's very much like...
[09:59.840 --> 09:59.980]  Yeah, you need it.
[09:59.980 --> 10:00.620]  The second sentence is over.
[10:00.800 --> 10:01.760]  I really enjoy it.
[10:02.360 --> 10:03.600]  How do you get that, Nick?
[10:03.600 --> 10:03.700]  Bear!
[10:04.540 --> 10:05.260]  Oh, to the right!
[10:05.440 --> 10:06.000]  Nick, to the right!
[10:06.000 --> 10:06.480]  You probably gotta...
[10:06.480 --> 10:06.960]  You gotta...
[10:06.960 --> 10:07.700]  There you go!
[10:08.220 --> 10:09.260]  Oh, what a jump!
[10:09.340 --> 10:09.980]  Oh, Nick!
[10:10.100 --> 10:11.520]  What a jump!
[10:11.680 --> 10:12.080]  Whoa!
[10:14.480 --> 10:14.880]  Go!
[10:15.140 --> 10:15.440]  Wow.
[10:15.860 --> 10:17.460]  You are putting on a clinic!
[10:17.760 --> 10:18.740]  Yeah, this is pretty great.
[10:18.880 --> 10:19.440]  Oh, I missed it.
[10:19.460 --> 10:19.880]  Oh, no!
[10:20.140 --> 10:21.300]  You just ran right past it!
[10:21.680 --> 10:21.800]  Bears!
[10:22.460 --> 10:23.360]  I saved them!
[10:25.660 --> 10:26.740]  I saved those bears!
[10:26.740 --> 10:30.120]  I can't imagine that you're getting anything better than bronze on that one, man.
[10:30.280 --> 10:31.180]  That one was...
[10:31.180 --> 10:32.780]  I mean, good job on the card.
[10:32.960 --> 10:34.180]  It's just, uh...
[10:34.180 --> 10:37.780]  This has to be, like, moving out where we gotta come back and do crazy stuff.
[10:37.980 --> 10:38.540]  You know what I mean?
[10:38.940 --> 10:40.440]  Also, we gotta get back into moving out.
[10:41.040 --> 10:44.080]  Looks like there's some confusion in the audience about who's playing.
[10:45.700 --> 10:46.400]  Ask Gavin!
[10:46.500 --> 10:47.300]  Oh, what is this?
[10:48.720 --> 10:50.120]  Oh, you gotta...
[10:50.120 --> 10:50.480]  There you go.
[10:50.500 --> 10:51.120]  You gotta time it better.
[10:51.320 --> 10:51.800]  It's like a trampoline.
[10:52.360 --> 10:53.640]  Dude, I think we should...
[10:53.640 --> 10:54.260]  To the right!
[10:55.140 --> 10:55.720]  Yeah, I see it.
[10:55.720 --> 10:57.940]  I think we should stream moving out again.
[10:58.120 --> 10:58.740]  You think so?
[10:58.980 --> 11:00.220]  Yeah, I think it's a good stream.
[11:00.500 --> 11:01.460]  It would be fun.
[11:01.960 --> 11:02.800]  Should we do it for falcons?
[11:03.920 --> 11:04.180]  Ooh.
[11:04.660 --> 11:05.640]  Yeah, let's do that.
[11:05.960 --> 11:06.140]  Okay.
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.160]  Yay!
[11:08.640 --> 11:09.000]  Oh!
[11:09.740 --> 11:11.020]  I'm so surprised.
[11:13.720 --> 11:14.600]  We're blind.
[11:15.120 --> 11:17.480]  I'm curious what the final stage is.
[11:17.680 --> 11:19.260]  Like, it looks like it's a different setup.
[11:19.920 --> 11:20.280]  What is that?
[11:21.860 --> 11:22.300]  Generator?
[11:22.980 --> 11:24.020]  Yeah, it's like a generator.
[11:24.140 --> 11:24.560]  What is that?
[11:24.560 --> 11:25.580]  I think you're gonna...
[11:25.580 --> 11:28.200]  I think you're gonna open more of the, like, world now.
[11:28.420 --> 11:29.700]  Like, I think you just turn...
[11:29.700 --> 11:29.760]  Oh!
[11:30.380 --> 11:32.640]  I think you turn something on...
[11:32.640 --> 11:33.860]  And it's gonna take you...
[11:34.400 --> 11:35.880]  Yeah, it's gonna take you somewhere special.
[11:37.600 --> 11:38.520]  Yeah, that's exciting.
[11:38.660 --> 11:39.320]  Oh, that's really cool.
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.980]  Oh, you got a chest!
[11:42.080 --> 11:42.840]  Can you open that chest?
[11:44.100 --> 11:45.800]  Yeah, why are you just running away from the chest?
[11:45.920 --> 11:46.180]  Go back!
[11:46.260 --> 11:46.940]  I can't get it.
[11:47.580 --> 11:48.580]  It's all locked up.
[11:48.800 --> 11:50.680]  Oh, you have to turn on the other one.
[11:50.720 --> 11:51.200]  Hit the button!
[11:51.300 --> 11:51.980]  Hit the green button!
[11:52.300 --> 11:53.680]  No, no, he's gotta turn on the other...
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.520]  See how there's, like, this white stripe?
[11:55.800 --> 11:56.300]  Not the band.
[11:56.760 --> 11:57.820]  That's a great two-person band.
[11:58.220 --> 11:59.040]  But I think you have to turn this on.
[11:59.040 --> 11:59.820]  I was gonna say, that's not a trio.
[11:59.980 --> 12:00.080]  Yeah.
[12:00.860 --> 12:01.220]  Yeah.
[12:02.480 --> 12:03.020]  That makes sense.
[12:03.040 --> 12:03.200]  Here we go!
[12:03.580 --> 12:04.420]  Let's see what we got.
[12:06.100 --> 12:06.460]  Okay.
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.020]  That's kind of been what we've been doing.
[12:08.820 --> 12:09.720]  Oh, but it's jumping.
[12:10.640 --> 12:11.640]  Watch out for those bears.
[12:12.580 --> 12:14.300]  I'm just keeping my eyes open for collectibles.
[12:14.500 --> 12:15.100]  I'm just scanning.
[12:15.360 --> 12:16.780]  Thank you, I appreciate it.
[12:17.860 --> 12:18.500]  Look out, birds.
[12:19.940 --> 12:20.260]  Weep.
[12:20.760 --> 12:21.740]  What platform is this on?
[12:22.740 --> 12:23.100]  Steam.
[12:23.520 --> 12:23.740]  Steam.
[12:29.320 --> 12:31.880]  What am I missing by not going for those bears?
[12:32.020 --> 12:32.800]  Goddamn it, bear!
[12:33.540 --> 12:34.620]  You're not missing the bear.
[12:34.900 --> 12:35.580]  Yeah, I don't know.
[12:35.700 --> 12:37.620]  There has to be something happening over there on the left.
[12:38.120 --> 12:38.600]  Get it!
[12:38.780 --> 12:39.060]  Oh, there!
[12:39.180 --> 12:39.520]  I got it!
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.460]  Nick, you're so good at this.
[12:41.680 --> 12:42.620]  It can't be you.
[12:43.180 --> 12:44.520]  Yeah, you might have found your calling, dude.
[12:44.800 --> 12:45.160]  Wee!
[12:45.180 --> 12:45.640]  I did it!
[12:45.780 --> 12:47.020]  Oh, I jumped over everything.
[12:48.440 --> 12:51.960]  This whole time, Nick thought it was last.
[12:51.960 --> 12:53.980]  Last of us in God of War, but it was really this game.
[12:55.560 --> 12:57.880]  I've been waiting for my game this whole time.
[12:58.500 --> 12:59.280]  Nick's a car guy.
[12:59.440 --> 13:01.160]  Like, in Rocket League, we did Rocket League.
[13:01.240 --> 13:03.600]  He also likes turbo golf racing as well.
[13:04.100 --> 13:04.500]  That's true.
[13:04.640 --> 13:05.120]  Oh, yeah.
[13:05.360 --> 13:05.980]  Big car guy.
[13:06.760 --> 13:07.120]  Collectible.
[13:07.280 --> 13:07.820]  Right off the start.
[13:08.380 --> 13:10.100]  Big golf guy, too, it turns out.
[13:11.680 --> 13:12.740]  Mind the gap, baby.
[13:13.820 --> 13:14.380]  Oh, shit.
[13:15.740 --> 13:16.100]  Whoa!
[13:17.140 --> 13:17.620]  Did I get it?
[13:17.860 --> 13:18.980]  I don't think you got it.
[13:19.020 --> 13:19.460]  You didn't?
[13:19.540 --> 13:20.200]  I thought you did.
[13:20.200 --> 13:20.900]  Did you not?
[13:21.140 --> 13:21.780]  I thought I did, too.
[13:22.480 --> 13:23.600]  I didn't see it.
[13:24.760 --> 13:26.040]  Start it over, start it over.
[13:26.260 --> 13:26.620]  It's okay.
[13:27.000 --> 13:27.980]  Okay, that's an uber duper.
[13:28.580 --> 13:28.760]  Yep.
[13:29.340 --> 13:30.400]  Alright, you got it right here.
[13:30.600 --> 13:31.180]  You got it right here.
[13:33.100 --> 13:33.760]  There you go.
[13:33.940 --> 13:34.160]  Nice!
[13:34.260 --> 13:34.880]  Right into the water.
[13:36.080 --> 13:37.260]  Gotta get it again, baby.
[13:37.780 --> 13:38.620]  You should get it, but live.
[13:39.320 --> 13:39.940]  Dude, guys.
[13:40.340 --> 13:41.860]  Fat balls with the gifted sub.
[13:41.940 --> 13:42.540]  Thanks, fat balls.
[13:42.580 --> 13:43.400]  God damn it!
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.100]  Thank you so much!
[13:46.160 --> 13:46.900]  Hey, thanks, fat balls.
[13:47.260 --> 13:52.320]  I hope those balls are healthy fat and not some sort of a cancerous growth fat.
[13:52.520 --> 13:53.520]  Yeah, like a bad one, yeah.
[13:53.840 --> 13:55.480]  Yeah, you didn't get it, but that's okay.
[13:55.760 --> 13:57.980]  Yeah, did you see we have the new Spum?
[13:58.040 --> 13:58.420]  I got it!
[13:58.580 --> 14:00.160]  The Spum Brat emote?
[14:00.160 --> 14:00.740]  I don't think you did.
[14:01.560 --> 14:02.440]  Yeah, I did see that.
[14:02.740 --> 14:03.920]  Oh, dude, it's so good.
[14:05.440 --> 14:07.620]  When you get it, it like pops up into the air.
[14:07.900 --> 14:08.200]  Oh!
[14:09.260 --> 14:09.620]  Nice.
[14:10.520 --> 14:11.240]  Should we replay it?
[14:11.420 --> 14:11.580]  No.
[14:12.500 --> 14:12.720]  Yes.
[14:12.900 --> 14:13.220]  Why would you?
[14:14.760 --> 14:15.480]  It's gone!
[14:15.660 --> 14:16.020]  We got it!
[14:16.020 --> 14:16.700]  Yeah, you got it.
[14:16.820 --> 14:17.720]  Oh, well then no.
[14:17.940 --> 14:18.640]  Then why would you replay it?
[14:18.640 --> 14:20.360]  Yeah, why did you want to replay it?
[14:21.180 --> 14:21.900]  Did Andrew send you?
[14:22.240 --> 14:23.840]  Well, I don't know why you asked.
[14:23.940 --> 14:25.660]  I thought you asked because you didn't get it.
[14:25.920 --> 14:26.080]  Same.
[14:26.140 --> 14:27.820]  Well, I asked because you two told me I didn't get it.
[14:27.820 --> 14:28.640]  Where are you going?
[14:29.380 --> 14:30.080]  The wrong way.
[14:30.520 --> 14:32.420]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't, there's not even a need to do this.
[14:32.460 --> 14:33.020]  You've already done it.
[14:33.260 --> 14:34.240]  Go back to the map.
[14:34.820 --> 14:36.180]  There's a map icon!
[14:38.440 --> 14:39.360]  There's a map icon.
[14:41.700 --> 14:43.260]  What the fuck?
[14:44.100 --> 14:44.820]  My brain.
[14:44.820 --> 14:45.860]  What brain?
[14:46.980 --> 14:47.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:48.000 --> 14:48.380]  Which way?
[14:49.000 --> 14:49.860]  Go right.
[14:50.200 --> 14:51.020]  Dealer's choice.
[14:53.420 --> 14:53.600]  Right.
[14:53.860 --> 14:54.000]  He's a dealer.
[14:54.520 --> 14:55.960]  Nope, I want to see what's over here.
[14:57.000 --> 14:57.620]  Secret path.
[14:58.980 --> 15:00.040]  I'm the dealer.
[15:00.220 --> 15:01.560]  Why did Nick ask?
[15:02.340 --> 15:03.380]  I asked.
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.060]  Just to go the other way.
[15:05.240 --> 15:06.660]  To be contrarian.
[15:06.820 --> 15:09.340]  Oh, these are scissors, watch out!
[15:10.100 --> 15:11.880]  You shouldn't be running around scissors.
[15:12.820 --> 15:13.600]  Oh, you should know.
[15:13.600 --> 15:14.300]  Oh, wow.
[15:16.500 --> 15:17.440]  Gotta get the collectible.
[15:17.580 --> 15:19.080]  How are you gonna get the collectible, Nick?
[15:20.180 --> 15:20.720]  I see it.
[15:26.480 --> 15:27.500]  This is great.
[15:28.460 --> 15:30.780]  Dude, I think I have to get this game.
[15:30.880 --> 15:31.680]  This game rocks.
[15:32.240 --> 15:33.300]  This is really funny.
[15:34.240 --> 15:36.360]  I'm really happy it wound up in my Steam account.
[15:36.440 --> 15:36.960]  Yeah, no kidding.
[15:37.180 --> 15:40.200]  I wonder if there'll be any multiplayer modes, like where we're racing through this.
[15:40.440 --> 15:41.320]  Oh, that'd be a lot of fun.
[15:43.000 --> 15:43.360]  Nice!
[15:43.980 --> 15:44.780]  Definitely got it.
[15:44.900 --> 15:45.440]  That was perfect.
[15:45.660 --> 15:45.780]  Scissor!
[15:46.000 --> 15:46.340]  Perfect.
[15:46.780 --> 15:47.740]  Just don't get chopped off.
[15:47.760 --> 15:48.360]  One more you gotta dodge.
[15:49.880 --> 15:50.660]  I think you're the right way.
[15:50.820 --> 15:50.960]  Okay, rank's gold.
[15:51.580 --> 15:52.600]  Yeah, big time, go.
[15:52.820 --> 15:53.540]  Oh, Nick!
[15:53.560 --> 15:54.100]  Oh, baby!
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.360]  Get over the birds, you got it!
[15:56.380 --> 15:57.360]  Go, go, go, go, go!
[15:57.400 --> 15:57.560]  Nice!
[15:58.340 --> 15:58.700]  Yeah!
[15:58.900 --> 15:59.440]  You got that.
[15:59.620 --> 16:00.300]  Let's see what we got.
[16:00.360 --> 16:01.700]  Speed run, gold, easy.
[16:02.560 --> 16:02.920]  Easy.
[16:03.740 --> 16:04.760]  Good job, man.
[16:05.740 --> 16:06.340]  Thank you, man.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.080]  It was you.
[16:08.660 --> 16:13.460]  Spiritually, this feels like a speed run version of Katamari Damacy.
[16:14.340 --> 16:14.740]  Totally.
[16:14.740 --> 16:15.580]  Yeah, I agree.
[16:15.940 --> 16:17.500]  Oh, what the?
[16:17.620 --> 16:18.600]  It definitely has the same vibe.
[16:18.980 --> 16:19.160]  Yeah.
[16:19.320 --> 16:19.860]  So what's over here?
[16:21.420 --> 16:22.580]  I can't do that yet, huh?
[16:22.580 --> 16:22.780]  Why?
[16:22.940 --> 16:23.980]  Why can't you go on that?
[16:24.020 --> 16:25.080]  Just run, just run, just run.
[16:25.160 --> 16:26.020]  I'm sure it'll bounce you.
[16:26.100 --> 16:27.020]  Why wouldn't you go?
[16:27.240 --> 16:29.500]  This is the thing that we've seen what it does.
[16:31.620 --> 16:33.080]  We know what this does.
[16:34.180 --> 16:35.060]  I don't know about that.
[16:35.480 --> 16:36.120]  Oh, no!
[16:37.320 --> 16:38.160]  Oh, I...
[16:38.160 --> 16:38.500]  Hello, old friend.
[16:38.500 --> 16:39.120]  You got this.
[16:42.240 --> 16:43.400]  This is exciting.
[16:44.360 --> 16:45.340]  Oh, look!
[16:45.540 --> 16:46.140]  Pizza doughnuts.
[16:46.800 --> 16:47.260]  Pizza doughnuts.
[16:47.260 --> 16:48.020]  Pizza doughnuts, Geoff.
[16:48.240 --> 16:49.240]  Pizza doughnuts.
[16:49.320 --> 16:50.180]  Car with boost.
[16:50.240 --> 16:50.840]  You got this.
[16:52.840 --> 16:53.960]  Don't we have those in Austin?
[16:53.960 --> 16:54.140]  Oh, that sounds nice.
[16:54.260 --> 16:55.840]  Isn't that what that Gordo's place is?
[16:56.440 --> 16:56.840]  Probably.
[16:57.020 --> 16:58.880]  Did they call it half of those locations or whatever?
[16:58.880 --> 16:59.580]  I think so, yeah.
[16:59.700 --> 17:01.420]  Turns out people didn't want that many doughnuts.
[17:01.680 --> 17:02.300]  Yeah, crazy.
[17:02.820 --> 17:04.060]  Check it out, it's gourmet doughnuts.
[17:04.140 --> 17:04.480]  Oh, yeah?
[17:04.620 --> 17:05.280]  Well, not really.
[17:05.820 --> 17:07.180]  Hey, we got lunch doughnuts.
[17:07.200 --> 17:08.100]  We got dinner doughnuts.
[17:08.980 --> 17:10.160]  Yeah, yeah, but you got...
[17:10.160 --> 17:11.360]  Mostly lunch and dinner doughnuts.
[17:11.360 --> 17:12.280]  You're gonna have to redo it.
[17:12.280 --> 17:14.080]  I don't know how you get that collectible.
[17:15.780 --> 17:16.180]  Interesting.
[17:16.740 --> 17:17.420]  You gotta replay it.
[17:18.500 --> 17:19.160]  There you go.
[17:20.600 --> 17:21.340]  Okay, alright.
[17:23.400 --> 17:24.380]  How do I...
[17:24.380 --> 17:25.420]  Can I not go around the...
[17:25.420 --> 17:25.920]  Oh, sorry, bear.
[17:30.740 --> 17:34.320]  I'm looking to see if there's something that you can hop or get to.
[17:35.860 --> 17:36.740]  Oh, okay.
[17:37.500 --> 17:37.980]  You thinking?
[17:38.300 --> 17:39.460]  Don't worry, Nick's thinking.
[17:40.040 --> 17:42.520]  Not a tight turn, let me tell you.
[17:43.540 --> 17:47.720]  I think you have to go much further before you can move over to the left.
[17:47.840 --> 17:48.100]  You think?
[17:48.200 --> 17:50.340]  Yeah, because that doesn't take you to anything.
[17:50.700 --> 17:51.500]  Oh, you're sure right.
[17:51.600 --> 17:52.760]  I think that area up there.
[17:54.080 --> 17:55.880]  But how, I don't know.
[17:56.400 --> 17:57.260]  This way!
[17:57.540 --> 17:58.200]  Oh, oh, oh!
[17:59.060 --> 17:59.780]  Nice, Nick!
[17:59.820 --> 18:00.260]  Nice!
[18:00.320 --> 18:00.840]  Way to go!
[18:02.380 --> 18:04.080]  You better make that jump, buddy!
[18:04.080 --> 18:04.880]  Oh, there you go.
[18:05.100 --> 18:05.780]  Good job!
[18:05.980 --> 18:06.440]  There we go.
[18:06.580 --> 18:09.300]  Okay, easy, easy, easy, easy, bury it.
[18:09.580 --> 18:10.060]  Alright, over.
[18:11.300 --> 18:11.700]  Nice!
[18:12.720 --> 18:13.460]  There you go!
[18:14.240 --> 18:14.640]  Nice!
[18:15.400 --> 18:16.280]  Oh, what a launch!
[18:16.300 --> 18:17.120]  Way to go, dude!
[18:18.080 --> 18:19.480]  That was perfect, Nick.
[18:20.100 --> 18:21.120]  We don't need...
[18:21.640 --> 18:23.160]  Yeah, who cares about the next one?
[18:23.300 --> 18:24.660]  I don't care about that, you got the thing.
[18:25.900 --> 18:30.400]  It looks like you're getting close to opening this package and all these bears are dancing.
[18:30.580 --> 18:31.140]  That's so cool.
[18:31.140 --> 18:33.240]  Hey, do you guys want to weigh in?
[18:33.700 --> 18:36.220]  The chat is picking their favorite bears.
[18:36.440 --> 18:37.620]  Do you guys have a favorite bear?
[18:38.340 --> 18:40.800]  I like the long legs bear, I think.
[18:44.720 --> 18:46.260]  Man, favorite bear?
[18:47.400 --> 18:48.440]  Oh, just a general?
[18:48.680 --> 18:49.620]  I thought we were going in bear.
[18:49.880 --> 18:51.200]  General bear...
[18:51.200 --> 18:52.100]  Oh, let me think.
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.680]  Paddington's coming up a lot.
[18:54.860 --> 18:55.960]  Oh, Paddington is a great bear.
[18:56.660 --> 18:56.860]  Oh!
[18:57.480 --> 18:58.260]  Walter Payton!
[18:59.580 --> 19:00.060]  Oh!
[19:00.540 --> 19:03.160]  Mine would be William Perry, probably, the refrigerator.
[19:03.400 --> 19:04.040]  Yeah, yeah, the refrigerator.
[19:04.420 --> 19:05.420]  Rex Grossman.
[19:05.720 --> 19:06.100]  Oh!
[19:06.480 --> 19:07.200]  I changed my answer!
[19:07.320 --> 19:07.940]  Rex Grossman!
[19:08.700 --> 19:10.200]  I don't know who Rex Grossman is.
[19:10.340 --> 19:11.820]  You don't remember Sexy Rexy?
[19:12.440 --> 19:15.380]  Dude, he took him to a Superbowl and it was terrible.
[19:15.700 --> 19:17.560]  Unleash the fucking dragon!
[19:18.060 --> 19:19.520]  Dude, Rex Grossman rules.
[19:19.520 --> 19:20.720]  I know who you're talking about now.
[19:21.320 --> 19:23.000]  I like Yogi a lot.
[19:23.880 --> 19:25.260]  Oh, that's a good one, too.
[19:25.720 --> 19:27.320]  Winnie the Pooh is great.
[19:27.320 --> 19:29.900]  He walks around dick out all day long.
[19:29.900 --> 19:31.020]  Nick, can you open that or no?
[19:31.980 --> 19:33.020]  Oh, you're right, sorry.
[19:33.180 --> 19:33.440]  What?
[19:33.620 --> 19:33.980]  Oh, I can!
[19:33.980 --> 19:34.640]  Are you okay?
[19:35.520 --> 19:37.400]  I saw something floating in the ocean.
[19:37.540 --> 19:38.800]  He has gamer tunnel vision.
[19:39.920 --> 19:40.360]  Crazy!
[19:40.800 --> 19:41.220]  Ooh!
[19:41.960 --> 19:42.400]  A trophy!
[19:43.040 --> 19:43.660]  A trophy!
[19:44.040 --> 19:45.120]  Oh, nice!
[19:45.560 --> 19:48.360]  I'm putting an image link in the chat.
[19:49.460 --> 19:50.980]  I'll just drop it here for us.
[19:52.260 --> 19:52.700]  Whale!
[19:52.920 --> 19:55.080]  But when I think of Rex Grossman, that's what I think of.
[19:55.140 --> 19:55.420]  Oh, shit!
[19:55.420 --> 19:59.160]  It's just an image of him saying, fuck it, I'm going deep, fan club.
[19:59.580 --> 20:02.320]  You gotta unleash the dragon.
[20:04.420 --> 20:07.620]  You think a five yard out's gonna win you a game?
[20:11.280 --> 20:13.740]  That's so cool. That's my favorite bear.
[20:14.440 --> 20:17.100]  Somebody said, Andrew Maines, Winnie the Pooh.
[20:17.180 --> 20:18.040]  Except that was very funny.
[20:18.960 --> 20:19.920]  That's pretty good.
[20:20.380 --> 20:22.520]  Oh, wow. Dude, Nick, you're doing good.
[20:22.940 --> 20:24.140]  I gotta get on another whale.
[20:24.140 --> 20:26.500]  You gotta wait for that whale and then do it again. This rocks.
[20:27.360 --> 20:28.360]  Oh, here we go.
[20:29.200 --> 20:31.160]  Can he catch the whale twice in one run?
[20:31.820 --> 20:32.420]  You got it right here.
[20:32.420 --> 20:33.520]  He's gotta get him a second time.
[20:33.680 --> 20:36.420]  You gotta loop, you gotta loop, you gotta loop.
[20:36.440 --> 20:37.260]  You gotta hurry, you got it.
[20:37.360 --> 20:38.260]  You got it, you got it, go!
[20:40.760 --> 20:41.080]  Nice!
[20:41.420 --> 20:42.080]  Hang on, there's more.
[20:42.120 --> 20:43.660]  Get him a third time, get him a third time.
[20:43.760 --> 20:44.380]  Catch the whale!
[20:45.860 --> 20:46.800]  Catch the whale, Nick.
[20:46.940 --> 20:47.220]  Now!
[20:47.340 --> 20:47.620]  Catch him!
[20:47.740 --> 20:48.500]  Oh, perfect.
[20:50.380 --> 20:51.480]  We did it!
[20:51.480 --> 20:54.120]  Oh, no, it's the fucking Jack Skellington.
[20:54.160 --> 20:54.360]  Oh, no!
[20:55.680 --> 20:56.980]  Jack Skellington!
[20:57.020 --> 20:57.860]  Would you like...
[20:57.860 --> 20:58.460]  Oh, hello.
[20:59.340 --> 21:00.400]  This is Halloween?
[21:04.100 --> 21:04.840]  This game.
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.260]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:06.540 --> 21:08.420]  Skull level! Skull level!
[21:09.340 --> 21:10.860]  You shouldn't be here!
[21:13.360 --> 21:14.300]  Firework carpet!
[21:14.600 --> 21:15.540]  It's very clear in this one.
[21:16.040 --> 21:19.780]  Dude, this game is awesome.
[21:19.780 --> 21:21.520]  You shouldn't be here.
[21:22.820 --> 21:24.560]  Don't stop me now.
[21:25.480 --> 21:26.500]  Oh, boy.
[21:26.560 --> 21:27.380]  Oh, wow.
[21:27.480 --> 21:28.260]  I missed it.
[21:28.280 --> 21:29.000]  Nick, shit.
[21:29.460 --> 21:29.640]  Alright.
[21:30.340 --> 21:31.960]  He's going deep.
[21:33.620 --> 21:34.320]  There you go.
[21:34.340 --> 21:35.000]  Oh, nice.
[21:35.820 --> 21:36.480]  Oh, man.
[21:38.720 --> 21:39.680]  Go, Nick!
[21:39.760 --> 21:41.060]  Okay, good commitment.
[21:42.380 --> 21:42.960]  Good commitment.
[21:46.240 --> 21:48.700]  The game screwed you, that wasn't you.
[21:49.100 --> 21:50.000]  Yeah, thank you.
[21:50.780 --> 21:52.200]  Triband didn't want you to win.
[21:52.440 --> 21:52.880]  Oh, shit.
[21:53.240 --> 21:54.200]  Never mind, that was you.
[21:54.460 --> 21:54.820]  That was you.
[21:54.960 --> 21:55.500]  Yeah, that was you.
[21:56.340 --> 21:57.900]  I honestly might take it back.
[21:58.580 --> 21:58.600]  Yeah.
[21:59.080 --> 21:59.640]  Oh, balls.
[21:59.840 --> 22:00.720]  Okay, you got it.
[22:00.740 --> 22:01.580]  We got it, we got it, we got it.
[22:01.800 --> 22:02.520]  Clickable on the right.
[22:02.940 --> 22:03.460]  Yeah, we go.
[22:03.540 --> 22:04.040]  Oh, where?
[22:04.340 --> 22:04.640]  Where?
[22:04.740 --> 22:05.560]  No, not that right.
[22:05.920 --> 22:07.460]  Up ahead, up ahead on the right.
[22:07.640 --> 22:08.360]  Up ahead on the right.
[22:08.900 --> 22:10.020]  I didn't see it either, Nick.
[22:10.040 --> 22:10.600]  I was with you.
[22:11.320 --> 22:13.260]  I think Andrew might be working with Triband.
[22:13.660 --> 22:14.960]  Oh, I see it, I see it.
[22:16.520 --> 22:18.060]  Why does Triband hate us?
[22:20.240 --> 22:20.620]  Whoa.
[22:20.780 --> 22:21.640]  Get it.
[22:21.980 --> 22:22.880]  No, I missed it.
[22:23.420 --> 22:24.240]  Hold on, that's okay.
[22:24.500 --> 22:25.140]  I'm going to turn back.
[22:26.520 --> 22:27.140]  Okay, here we go.
[22:27.200 --> 22:27.520]  There you go.
[22:27.600 --> 22:28.080]  Off the roof.
[22:28.180 --> 22:28.660]  Nice and easy.
[22:28.880 --> 22:29.380]  Nice and easy.
[22:30.160 --> 22:31.740]  Oh, I got it.
[22:31.780 --> 22:32.240]  There you go.
[22:32.400 --> 22:32.840]  Oh, my God.
[22:32.880 --> 22:33.240]  Yeah.
[22:34.260 --> 22:34.640]  Awesome.
[22:35.060 --> 22:35.660]  Hit the boost.
[22:36.000 --> 22:36.860]  Hit the boost.
[22:37.300 --> 22:37.480]  Okay.
[22:37.740 --> 22:38.400]  The boost.
[22:39.960 --> 22:41.120]  Thank God they're floppy.
[22:41.660 --> 22:43.080]  Oh, where am I supposed to...
[22:43.080 --> 22:43.700]  Left and then right.
[22:43.780 --> 22:44.760]  Oh, I see, I see.
[22:45.180 --> 22:45.420]  I see.
[22:45.820 --> 22:45.980]  Okay.
[22:46.560 --> 22:47.740]  Oh, my God.
[22:48.360 --> 22:49.140]  Thread the needle.
[22:49.840 --> 22:50.820]  Nick, thread the needle.
[22:51.260 --> 22:51.480]  Oh, no.
[22:51.880 --> 22:52.040]  Okay.
[22:52.220 --> 22:52.500]  Nick.
[22:52.700 --> 22:53.060]  That's okay.
[22:55.160 --> 22:56.140]  All right, here we go.
[22:56.180 --> 22:56.640]  Up and over.
[22:57.660 --> 22:57.940]  Okay.
[22:58.140 --> 22:58.800]  One more, one more.
[22:58.880 --> 22:59.180]  Here you go.
[22:59.200 --> 22:59.680]  You got it.
[23:00.500 --> 23:00.980]  All right.
[23:01.660 --> 23:02.380]  Oh, my God.
[23:02.700 --> 23:03.020]  Good.
[23:03.160 --> 23:03.520]  I'm so tense.
[23:03.540 --> 23:04.080]  Okay, here we go.
[23:04.920 --> 23:05.800]  Oh, you're so close.
[23:05.800 --> 23:06.440]  It's right there, it's right there, it's right there.
[23:06.480 --> 23:07.060]  There it is.
[23:07.220 --> 23:07.540]  Yes.
[23:07.900 --> 23:07.960]  Yeah.
[23:08.960 --> 23:10.540]  Nick, that was brilliant.
[23:10.700 --> 23:11.020]  Holy cow.
[23:11.020 --> 23:13.440]  That was absolutely brilliant, Nick.
[23:14.400 --> 23:15.920]  You weren't even supposed to be here, dude.
[23:16.400 --> 23:16.800]  No.
[23:18.140 --> 23:20.280]  That bear's going to be very upset with me.
[23:21.740 --> 23:22.940]  That was crazy.
[23:23.600 --> 23:24.400]  What's over there?
[23:24.800 --> 23:25.100]  Oh, okay.
[23:25.240 --> 23:26.040]  It's just...
[23:26.040 --> 23:26.520]  There you go.
[23:26.800 --> 23:27.660]  This brought you back.
[23:27.720 --> 23:28.180]  You did it.
[23:29.120 --> 23:29.920]  Good job.
[23:30.400 --> 23:31.380]  That was worth opening.
[23:31.520 --> 23:31.840]  All right.
[23:31.940 --> 23:32.400]  Way to go.
[23:33.380 --> 23:34.160]  That was pretty good stuff.
[23:34.380 --> 23:36.200]  All right, let's go back to the easy stages now.
[23:36.380 --> 23:36.540]  Yeah.
[23:37.100 --> 23:37.820]  No, I'm kidding.
[23:39.460 --> 23:39.860]  Yes.
[23:41.600 --> 23:42.800]  It has arms now?
[23:42.960 --> 23:43.360]  Glide.
[23:43.480 --> 23:44.280]  Oh, A to glide.
[23:45.980 --> 23:46.580]  Oh, boy.
[23:46.580 --> 23:47.680]  I like the cocaine bear.
[23:48.060 --> 23:48.760]  That was a good bear.
[23:48.960 --> 23:50.020]  Oh, cocaine bear is a good one, too.
[23:50.040 --> 23:50.380]  Oh, cocaine bear.
[23:50.500 --> 23:50.900]  Great bear.
[23:51.160 --> 23:51.700]  Click them on the right.
[23:51.760 --> 23:52.860]  The real one or the movie one?
[23:53.500 --> 23:53.760]  Both.
[23:53.840 --> 23:54.260]  Come on, Nick.
[23:54.320 --> 23:54.940]  Come on, Nick.
[23:55.320 --> 23:55.980]  I got it.
[23:56.000 --> 23:56.400]  I got it.
[23:56.480 --> 23:57.660]  Right on the edge.
[23:57.820 --> 23:59.380]  Easy fucking collectible there for you.
[23:59.800 --> 24:00.660]  Baby mode, dude.
[24:01.060 --> 24:02.120]  This is baby mode.
[24:03.900 --> 24:04.480]  There you go.
[24:04.620 --> 24:08.360]  It's like Nick went to Vietnam and then came back and became a scout leader.
[24:08.960 --> 24:09.680]  Yeah, definitely.
[24:11.280 --> 24:12.720]  Oh, you're right on the line.
[24:13.200 --> 24:13.840]  You're so close.
[24:14.960 --> 24:15.480]  Tough.
[24:16.260 --> 24:18.320]  That does annoy me that I didn't get gold.
[24:18.800 --> 24:19.580]  Oh, well.
[24:20.560 --> 24:21.260]  Keep it going.
[24:21.500 --> 24:22.080]  Keep it going.
[24:23.020 --> 24:26.180]  Guys, we're working to get to 5.01 p.m. on a Friday.
[24:26.520 --> 24:27.380]  The best time.
[24:28.480 --> 24:31.000]  Everybody's working for that 5.01.
[24:34.440 --> 24:41.040]  Do you remember back when everybody just wore Levi's button fly 5.01 jeans?
[24:41.320 --> 24:41.500]  Yeah.
[24:41.640 --> 24:42.840]  And you had to say it like that?
[24:42.840 --> 24:43.540]  It was so stupid.
[24:44.100 --> 24:46.240]  You couldn't just say Levi's.
[24:46.760 --> 24:49.000]  Button fly was a weird time.
[24:49.400 --> 24:49.880]  Fuck.
[24:50.140 --> 24:50.860]  Button fly.
[24:51.100 --> 24:51.340]  Yeah.
[24:51.500 --> 24:56.060]  I was pro button fly and then I was quickly anti-button fly.
[24:56.220 --> 24:57.700]  Here's the problem with button flying.
[24:58.020 --> 25:04.180]  I think that when you're a drunk, it's really great because, boy, you're ripping those off and you're getting to pissing.
[25:04.500 --> 25:05.440]  Like nothing's stopping you.
[25:05.720 --> 25:08.400]  The problem is when you're a drunk, putting them back on, tough.
[25:08.400 --> 25:08.920]  Oh, yeah.
[25:09.080 --> 25:09.480]  It's brutal.
[25:09.680 --> 25:09.700]  Nick!
[25:10.100 --> 25:11.060]  Tough task.
[25:11.860 --> 25:13.240]  Nick, you better fall off and try again.
[25:14.300 --> 25:15.600]  No, you can't.
[25:15.880 --> 25:17.300]  Jump, little car.
[25:17.400 --> 25:19.100]  The bears are, like, making fun of you, dude.
[25:19.580 --> 25:20.120]  Yeah, they are.
[25:23.360 --> 25:27.700]  The one time I had trouble with button fly is when, you know when you rent, like, a suit?
[25:28.100 --> 25:28.280]  Yeah.
[25:28.320 --> 25:29.080]  How it's different.
[25:29.280 --> 25:32.940]  You know, you're not used to the equipment there, right?
[25:33.020 --> 25:33.260]  Yeah.
[25:33.420 --> 25:33.700]  So...
[25:33.700 --> 25:34.880]  What is he trying to say?
[25:35.360 --> 25:36.740]  I almost pissed myself.
[25:36.820 --> 25:37.140]  Okay.
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.440]  Because I had a little bit to drink at the wedding.
[25:40.440 --> 25:40.980]  Uh-huh.
[25:41.060 --> 25:41.540]  And then I, uh...
[25:41.540 --> 25:43.800]  You had a button fly suit?
[25:44.140 --> 25:45.700]  Did you forget what you were doing?
[25:46.220 --> 25:47.880]  Did you have a denim suit at your own wedding?
[25:49.040 --> 25:49.240]  No.
[25:49.860 --> 25:50.040]  What?
[25:50.420 --> 25:53.360]  You had a suit that was button fly?
[25:54.180 --> 25:54.580]  Yeah.
[25:54.860 --> 25:56.340]  It was like a redneck wedding.
[25:57.960 --> 26:01.700]  I don't think I've ever seen a button fly, like, trouser.
[26:03.420 --> 26:04.960]  You know what, Nick?
[26:04.960 --> 26:06.020]  I bet you looked great.
[26:06.520 --> 26:07.160]  You know what?
[26:07.380 --> 26:10.420]  If it wasn't button fly, I don't know what I'd do.
[26:10.420 --> 26:11.080]  I don't know what I'd do to those pants.
[26:14.540 --> 26:16.000]  They're in life's part of the problem.
[26:16.060 --> 26:16.740]  Yeah, there you go.
[26:16.940 --> 26:17.320]  Do it.
[26:18.060 --> 26:19.020]  What about you, chat?
[26:19.100 --> 26:21.640]  Did anybody have button fly pants for your wedding?
[26:25.820 --> 26:27.740]  Not getting a lot of affirmatives on that.
[26:28.360 --> 26:28.680]  Weird.
[26:30.240 --> 26:30.760]  You know what, Nick?
[26:30.840 --> 26:33.340]  I bet it was appropriate for the time and you looked fantastic.
[26:34.840 --> 26:37.880]  I don't know that a button fly suit would ever be appropriate for the time.
[26:37.960 --> 26:38.940]  I just don't know what that is.
[26:38.940 --> 26:41.280]  It's like back when Gus used to wear dress shirts.
[26:41.420 --> 26:43.440]  He would always wear collarless dress shirts.
[26:43.700 --> 26:44.100]  What?
[26:45.740 --> 26:47.940]  Like Tom Hanks at the Oscars?
[26:48.800 --> 26:48.820]  Yeah.
[26:49.700 --> 26:50.100]  Right?
[26:51.040 --> 26:53.840]  I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it.
[26:53.880 --> 26:54.560]  Oh, Nick!
[26:54.840 --> 26:55.220]  Oh!
[26:56.240 --> 26:57.920]  That was almost incredible.
[26:59.040 --> 26:59.580]  Yep, almost.
[27:00.580 --> 27:01.740]  Like, what?
[27:02.900 --> 27:07.840]  Yeah, and I was always like, I guess it's kind of a thing right now, but man, is it a weird choice.
[27:08.280 --> 27:10.480]  He held onto it for a little too long, but he let it go.
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.300]  I just dropped an image in our Discord.
[27:12.520 --> 27:12.980]  Is that it?
[27:13.040 --> 27:13.900]  Okay, let me look.
[27:14.660 --> 27:15.900]  It's just no...
[27:15.900 --> 27:17.640]  God damn it!
[27:18.100 --> 27:18.440]  Yeah.
[27:18.580 --> 27:18.880]  Crazy.
[27:20.140 --> 27:20.800]  That's weird.
[27:20.940 --> 27:21.740]  I don't like that at all.
[27:23.540 --> 27:24.420]  Gus did that?
[27:24.520 --> 27:24.980]  Oh yeah.
[27:25.860 --> 27:26.340]  Weird guy.
[27:27.140 --> 27:27.280]  Yeah.
[27:28.240 --> 27:29.560]  He wouldn't button a top button though.
[27:30.060 --> 27:30.720]  And he was comfortable?
[27:31.160 --> 27:32.020]  Geoff's friend Gus.
[27:32.120 --> 27:33.200]  All of our friend Gus.
[27:35.700 --> 27:36.960]  You have to claim them too.
[27:36.960 --> 27:38.880]  You got coffee with him this morning.
[27:38.980 --> 27:39.940]  It's true, I did.
[27:40.520 --> 27:41.160]  You did?
[27:41.220 --> 27:41.740]  Where'd you go?
[27:42.600 --> 27:43.240]  Oh, never mind.
[27:43.460 --> 27:46.460]  You gotta listen to the new podcast to find out.
[27:47.780 --> 27:48.840]  You also know Nick.
[27:50.320 --> 27:51.640]  We talked about it yesterday.
[27:51.980 --> 27:52.360]  Where they were going.
[27:52.880 --> 27:53.380]  Oh, that's true.
[27:53.580 --> 27:53.840]  We did.
[27:54.060 --> 27:54.400]  That's true.
[27:54.520 --> 27:54.780]  We did.
[27:55.600 --> 27:56.840]  He doesn't remember, but...
[27:56.840 --> 27:58.620]  That feels like a lifetime ago.
[28:00.660 --> 28:01.060]  God!
[28:01.480 --> 28:02.020]  Oh no!
[28:02.360 --> 28:02.640]  Wall!
[28:02.720 --> 28:03.160]  He missed.
[28:03.280 --> 28:03.920]  He's going the long way.
[28:05.740 --> 28:08.980]  Yeah, you're running your car the long way, dude.
[28:10.080 --> 28:11.100]  The long way home.
[28:13.440 --> 28:14.760]  That was pretty cool.
[28:15.040 --> 28:15.560]  That was really cool.
[28:15.560 --> 28:16.360]  Thank you!
[28:19.500 --> 28:19.980]  Nice!
[28:20.940 --> 28:21.580]  It's like corn the long way.
[28:21.700 --> 28:22.580]  This is pretty cool.
[28:28.180 --> 28:31.140]  You ever do the buttering technique in war games?
[28:31.140 --> 28:34.360]  Dude, I was gonna bring that up for something.
[28:34.680 --> 28:36.360]  It's awesome, isn't it?
[28:37.160 --> 28:37.760]  It's a move.
[28:37.940 --> 28:38.980]  I've never done it.
[28:39.020 --> 28:40.420]  I've never considered doing it.
[28:40.460 --> 28:41.780]  You get a piece of bread.
[28:42.100 --> 28:44.120]  You butter the bread.
[28:45.340 --> 28:48.260]  And then you wrap it around.
[28:48.780 --> 28:50.200]  I missed it.
[28:50.700 --> 28:51.560]  Yeah, I'll be a lunatic.
[28:52.880 --> 28:58.340]  Then you take the buttered bread and then you put the corn on the buttered bread.
[28:58.600 --> 29:00.880]  And then you close the bread around the corn.
[29:00.880 --> 29:03.300]  And then you roll the corn around in the butter.
[29:03.520 --> 29:05.680]  And then you have buttered bread and buttered corn.
[29:06.220 --> 29:09.140]  So you just jack off an ear of corn with buttery bread?
[29:09.460 --> 29:09.820]  Yes, you do.
[29:09.840 --> 29:10.220]  I'm good.
[29:10.880 --> 29:12.460]  I'm just letting you know what you can do, man.
[29:12.720 --> 29:13.640]  I'm not telling you you have to.
[29:14.800 --> 29:15.600]  We got it.
[29:15.640 --> 29:16.020]  Way to go!
[29:16.920 --> 29:17.280]  Thank you!
[29:17.620 --> 29:18.280]  Oh, and gold!
[29:18.660 --> 29:19.020]  Nice!
[29:19.200 --> 29:19.520]  Wow!
[29:20.420 --> 29:21.340]  Nice reading, bud.
[29:22.160 --> 29:23.980]  Hey, thanks for the subscription, Alpha Kappa.
[29:24.800 --> 29:25.620]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[29:25.620 --> 29:26.140]  Alpha Kappa!
[29:26.500 --> 29:28.300]  Liking7 gifted a bunch just a minute ago.
[29:28.360 --> 29:29.080]  Thank you very much.
[29:29.280 --> 29:29.620]  Appreciate it.
[29:29.620 --> 29:30.800]  Was that your alma mater, Nick?
[29:32.120 --> 29:32.420]  What?
[29:32.640 --> 29:33.200]  Alpha Kappa?
[29:33.400 --> 29:35.680]  Was that your...
[29:35.680 --> 29:36.680]  Oh, I never...
[29:36.680 --> 29:37.720]  Nick went to Texas A&M.
[29:41.380 --> 29:43.440]  I said that and it really messed him up.
[29:44.460 --> 29:46.280]  Well, my brain was like...
[29:46.280 --> 29:46.600]  What?
[29:46.860 --> 29:47.400]  What did you say?
[29:48.120 --> 29:48.960]  Let's try that again.
[29:49.780 --> 29:53.340]  I was accepted to two schools, Texas and A&M.
[29:54.480 --> 29:54.920]  Nice!
[29:56.480 --> 29:57.200]  Way to go, dude!
[29:57.200 --> 29:58.360]  How many did you...
[29:58.360 --> 30:01.000]  What was the most ambitious school you applied to?
[30:01.800 --> 30:02.440]  Those two.
[30:02.740 --> 30:03.060]  Oh, okay.
[30:03.200 --> 30:04.280]  Did you just apply to those two?
[30:04.760 --> 30:06.520]  Yeah, I'm not writing more shit.
[30:07.040 --> 30:08.840]  Just my ass college admissions offices.
[30:09.580 --> 30:10.840]  Dude, they make it so easy now.
[30:10.940 --> 30:11.920]  You just do it for your app.
[30:12.140 --> 30:14.200]  You write one thing and then submit to a million schools.
[30:14.340 --> 30:15.400]  Alright, going back, baby!
[30:15.400 --> 30:16.140]  Oh, here we go!
[30:16.180 --> 30:17.460]  About to open some new shit!
[30:20.320 --> 30:21.680]  Oh, hey!
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.460]  You know how you guys watched me do commentary on that AAPW show?
[30:25.980 --> 30:26.160]  Yeah.
[30:26.160 --> 30:28.280]  The next one's the 14th, by the way.
[30:28.700 --> 30:34.900]  I got asked to do backstage interviews for a company called Borracho Pro on Sunday.
[30:35.120 --> 30:35.220]  Oh, wow!
[30:35.220 --> 30:37.860]  So I'll be doing backstage interviews for Borracho Pro Wrestling.
[30:38.020 --> 30:40.640]  They're doing an event called Grapple Quest.
[30:41.100 --> 30:41.580]  It's pretty cool.
[30:41.900 --> 30:42.520]  There's no ropes.
[30:42.560 --> 30:42.780]  That's awesome, dude!
[30:42.860 --> 30:45.980]  It's a ring with no ropes and it's everyone just beating the shit out of each other.
[30:46.140 --> 30:46.620]  It's really cool.
[30:46.780 --> 30:47.640]  Is it in Austin?
[30:47.920 --> 30:48.060]  Where are we going?
[30:48.180 --> 30:48.660]  Yes, it is.
[30:48.700 --> 30:51.280]  It's at the Lake Creek Pinballs.
[30:51.380 --> 30:52.360]  So the one way up north.
[30:52.900 --> 30:53.160]  Oh.
[30:53.240 --> 30:53.700]  What is that?
[30:53.820 --> 30:54.600]  Great player made...
[30:56.340 --> 30:59.480]  Dude, Nick, do you like this bear that looks like he's hooking him?
[31:00.260 --> 31:01.760]  Dude, he's hooking him?
[31:02.340 --> 31:04.500]  Texas is going to Michigan this weekend?
[31:05.360 --> 31:07.400]  Gus brought that up this morning, I think.
[31:07.840 --> 31:08.320]  Yeah, he did.
[31:08.560 --> 31:08.860]  Oh, really?
[31:09.220 --> 31:10.660]  Gus was like, oh yeah, check this out.
[31:11.020 --> 31:12.200]  Sports aficionado Gus.
[31:12.200 --> 31:13.060]  Speaking of sports.
[31:13.160 --> 31:14.720]  Oh, we're going to the sports level?
[31:15.180 --> 31:16.860]  Oh, this is gonna rock.
[31:17.160 --> 31:18.580]  Guys, look at this stream.
[31:19.140 --> 31:22.840]  Speaking of sports, the hottest new event is about to hit the Kicker Picker.
[31:22.920 --> 31:24.220]  Do we know when that's coming out?
[31:24.860 --> 31:25.640]  Not yet.
[31:25.700 --> 31:26.920]  I don't think it's scheduled yet.
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.460]  But I think we should put it out very soon.
[31:28.460 --> 31:29.900]  I think we're talking about Thursday next week?
[31:30.320 --> 31:31.560]  So excited for that to hit.
[31:31.800 --> 31:35.900]  If you don't care about football in any way whatsoever, you're about to.
[31:36.180 --> 31:37.940]  At least one specific aspect.
[31:38.860 --> 31:40.540]  That's where a soccer ball goes.
[31:40.900 --> 31:42.600]  Nick's a gridiron fan, not a soccer fan.
[31:43.220 --> 31:43.740]  Wait, what happened?
[31:44.040 --> 31:44.880]  Hey, good enough.
[31:46.580 --> 31:49.140]  You can now access the community area from the homeroom.
[31:49.240 --> 31:49.520]  Okay.
[31:49.700 --> 31:50.060]  Okay.
[31:51.020 --> 31:51.420]  Thanks.
[31:51.600 --> 31:52.060]  Congrats.
[31:52.060 --> 31:54.080]  Oh, professor, hello.
[31:55.460 --> 31:57.840]  Why did you get an accent for that?
[31:58.980 --> 31:59.900]  I don't know.
[32:01.780 --> 32:07.040]  I realized I created a character for my kid that I call the Tickle Monster that goes,
[32:07.120 --> 32:08.060]  Oh, it's the Tickle Monster.
[32:08.340 --> 32:09.880]  He talks like that.
[32:10.060 --> 32:11.060]  I don't know why.
[32:11.320 --> 32:12.140]  He's German.
[32:12.480 --> 32:12.800]  Turn around.
[32:12.940 --> 32:13.360]  He's German.
[32:14.100 --> 32:14.200]  What?
[32:14.480 --> 32:14.860]  Turn around.
[32:15.100 --> 32:17.580]  You trying to make your kid scared of Germans?
[32:17.960 --> 32:18.600]  Yeah, it's working.
[32:19.060 --> 32:19.800]  Just in case.
[32:20.860 --> 32:21.820]  Dude, you never know.
[32:22.020 --> 32:23.920]  They said they wouldn't do it again, and then there we were.
[32:25.160 --> 32:26.020]  What a shot!
[32:26.240 --> 32:27.040]  Oh no, Nick!
[32:27.480 --> 32:28.960]  Dude, you fucking suck at Rocket League.
[32:29.080 --> 32:29.440]  Come on.
[32:29.980 --> 32:31.700]  This is not Rocket League, I can assure you.
[32:33.360 --> 32:34.780]  That was nice that it gave it to you.
[32:35.580 --> 32:37.040]  Oh my god, it didn't even move.
[32:38.340 --> 32:40.140]  Dude, Tickle Monster, come on.
[32:42.620 --> 32:43.560]  Nazi Tickle Monster.
[32:45.160 --> 32:46.020]  You gotta go right.
[32:46.440 --> 32:51.680]  I know you said not the Tickle Monster, but it also sounded a lot like you said Nazi Tickle Monster.
[32:53.100 --> 32:55.300]  Oh, the soccer balls are off to the picking, that's fun.
[32:55.460 --> 33:01.340]  Oh, I remember the reason I started doing that is because in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, there's a Von Drake.
[33:01.620 --> 33:05.640]  He's a professor, and he has like a... it's not a German accent, but it's close.
[33:06.260 --> 33:06.960]  It's getting messy.
[33:07.900 --> 33:09.660]  Where did Mickey Mouse get this guy?
[33:10.160 --> 33:10.940]  Oh my god!
[33:10.960 --> 33:13.000]  It's like if you put messy in Rampage.
[33:14.160 --> 33:15.200]  Oh my god!
[33:16.440 --> 33:17.300]  Keep going.
[33:17.400 --> 33:18.200]  Oh, collectible!
[33:18.440 --> 33:18.840]  Back, collectible!
[33:19.140 --> 33:19.280]  No!
[33:19.700 --> 33:20.100]  Go back!
[33:20.140 --> 33:20.840]  Score the goal!
[33:22.280 --> 33:23.160]  Nick, you...
[33:23.820 --> 33:24.620]  Where is it?
[33:24.720 --> 33:25.000]  Left.
[33:25.100 --> 33:25.620]  Oh, there it is.
[33:26.260 --> 33:26.840]  Nailed it.
[33:27.680 --> 33:28.120]  Nice!
[33:28.420 --> 33:30.080]  This is like going to an Austin FC game.
[33:30.140 --> 33:32.320]  No one's very good, and everyone's running backward.
[33:33.100 --> 33:34.060]  Yeah, but we're the snacks.
[33:34.400 --> 33:35.280]  God, did you see that?
[33:35.280 --> 33:39.200]  Did you see that White Sox doubleheader that only had 95 attendees?
[33:39.660 --> 33:40.620]  Yeah, that was awesome.
[33:41.160 --> 33:41.960]  That's crazy.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.960]  Yeah, I think it's time for Jerry to sell that team.
[33:44.660 --> 33:45.060]  Yeah.
[33:45.680 --> 33:48.040]  I can't believe the MLB is not making him.
[33:49.020 --> 33:49.420]  Insane.
[33:49.780 --> 33:54.780]  But I guess if they can let the A's owner do what he's doing, then they're not gonna...
[33:54.780 --> 33:56.520]  Yeah, White Sox look fucking great in comparison.
[33:56.580 --> 33:58.060]  Oh shit, this is cool.
[33:58.340 --> 33:59.320]  This is so cool.
[33:59.580 --> 34:00.060]  Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[34:00.120 --> 34:00.580]  Oh, you little bastard.
[34:01.460 --> 34:02.260]  You gotta shoot left.
[34:02.660 --> 34:03.340]  Oh, I'm an idiot.
[34:03.620 --> 34:04.260]  Yeah, I agree.
[34:05.380 --> 34:05.780]  God!
[34:06.160 --> 34:07.360]  You keep shooting it right to him.
[34:08.160 --> 34:10.580]  You wait for him to be in front of you, and then you do it.
[34:10.920 --> 34:12.080]  It's weird. It's an odd choice.
[34:12.940 --> 34:14.140]  Oh, fire it left.
[34:14.200 --> 34:14.740]  Keep left.
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.320]  Okay.
[34:16.540 --> 34:16.920]  What was that?
[34:19.020 --> 34:19.940]  Oh, I see.
[34:20.140 --> 34:21.780]  I see what you're calling for.
[34:22.300 --> 34:23.960]  Listen, that was insane.
[34:23.960 --> 34:24.940]  How did you not see that?
[34:24.940 --> 34:29.220]  Watching him do that and just go like, I mean, clearly we gotta go left, and he's like, right it is, baby.
[34:29.940 --> 34:32.740]  It's so present on the screen.
[34:32.920 --> 34:33.080]  Right.
[34:33.320 --> 34:34.120]  It's right there.
[34:34.760 --> 34:35.000]  No.
[34:35.280 --> 34:35.620]  Okay.
[34:36.400 --> 34:36.820]  There you go.
[34:36.860 --> 34:37.220]  Nice.
[34:37.660 --> 34:38.020]  There you go.
[34:38.020 --> 34:38.420]  Oh no!
[34:38.440 --> 34:39.280]  Don't get scored on.
[34:39.780 --> 34:41.120]  Don't have to do this again.
[34:41.120 --> 34:42.900]  This is your kryptonite right here.
[34:43.440 --> 34:44.580]  Oh, what a play.
[34:44.680 --> 34:44.960]  I got it.
[34:44.980 --> 34:46.500]  There you go.
[34:47.600 --> 34:48.060]  What a shot.
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.000]  Guys, I am very unhappy to report that my mouth is officially waking up.
[34:53.280 --> 34:53.740]  Oh no.
[34:54.520 --> 34:56.520]  It's a tingle monster.
[34:56.960 --> 34:57.180]  Yeah.
[34:57.640 --> 34:58.680]  Very uncomfortable.
[34:59.580 --> 35:00.180]  Oh no.
[35:06.060 --> 35:07.260]  Oh shit.
[35:07.620 --> 35:07.960]  Oh no.
[35:08.280 --> 35:08.720]  God!
[35:09.040 --> 35:09.400]  Nick!
[35:09.400 --> 35:11.420]  They all move in tandem.
[35:11.680 --> 35:12.480]  Can I just tell you?
[35:13.200 --> 35:14.580]  Yeah, have you ever played foosball?
[35:15.120 --> 35:15.800]  No, no, no, no.
[35:16.680 --> 35:18.960]  I'm saying the whole entire thing.
[35:19.040 --> 35:20.440]  Oh, this feels familiar.
[35:21.620 --> 35:24.020]  I was thinking about this the other day.
[35:24.120 --> 35:30.060]  We need to go ahead and get health and dental and ocular so that we can get Nick's fucking eyes checked.
[35:30.440 --> 35:31.480]  Yeah, dude, no kidding.
[35:32.120 --> 35:34.460]  You might need to go to like a super doctor.
[35:34.920 --> 35:38.300]  Yeah, if there's some sort of a triple optometrist.
[35:40.580 --> 35:41.060]  Uh...
[35:41.060 --> 35:41.380]  Nick.
[35:42.600 --> 35:43.260]  That's me.
[35:43.440 --> 35:44.280]  They move in tandem.
[35:44.680 --> 35:44.920]  Yeah.
[35:45.040 --> 35:45.540]  There you go.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.440]  Not just the three in the row. I mean the other rows also move in the same...
[35:50.440 --> 35:50.800]  Here we go.
[35:51.600 --> 35:52.080]  Angle.
[35:52.620 --> 35:53.080]  Up.
[35:54.120 --> 35:54.700]  Nice angle.
[35:55.360 --> 35:56.060]  It's coming back.
[35:56.720 --> 35:58.080]  3D ultra mini golf action.
[35:59.160 --> 36:00.780]  That feels a little familiar.
[36:02.420 --> 36:04.200]  Crazy how popular that game is all of a sudden.
[36:07.700 --> 36:08.420]  Oh, really?
[36:09.060 --> 36:09.260]  Yeah.
[36:10.620 --> 36:11.340]  Sort of.
[36:12.260 --> 36:13.380]  Here we go.
[36:15.040 --> 36:15.400]  Yeah.
[36:16.480 --> 36:17.080]  Here we go.
[36:17.360 --> 36:17.720]  Yeah.
[36:19.060 --> 36:19.420]  Nice.
[36:20.080 --> 36:20.480]  Thank you.
[36:20.520 --> 36:21.720]  Have you guys seen anything else?
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.760]  Like the secret thingy?
[36:24.920 --> 36:25.100]  No.
[36:25.380 --> 36:25.640]  No.
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.700]  No, we would have been screaming at you about it.
[36:27.820 --> 36:27.920]  Yeah.
[36:28.540 --> 36:30.340]  You would have been looking around confused.
[36:30.540 --> 36:30.780]  There it is.
[36:30.920 --> 36:31.360]  There it is.
[36:31.380 --> 36:31.920]  Yeah, but also...
[36:31.920 --> 36:32.240]  It's up there.
[36:32.240 --> 36:33.400]  Also, I started ignoring you.
[36:33.400 --> 36:34.120]  Nick is right in front of you.
[36:35.880 --> 36:36.800]  Alright, here we go.
[36:36.820 --> 36:40.420]  We gotta do this, and then this, and then this, and then this, and then...
[36:40.420 --> 36:41.900]  That didn't work.
[36:42.860 --> 36:45.420]  It not only didn't work, it wasn't close to working.
[36:46.200 --> 36:46.960]  I have to...
[36:46.960 --> 36:47.460]  Oh, I see.
[36:48.020 --> 36:48.780]  Just get it...
[36:48.780 --> 36:49.560]  There you go.
[36:52.120 --> 36:53.540]  Let him kick it by you.
[36:53.600 --> 36:53.940]  It's fine.
[36:54.780 --> 36:54.900]  Yeah.
[36:55.680 --> 36:56.240]  Let's see.
[36:56.580 --> 36:58.660]  Okay, so I'm not sure what...
[36:59.380 --> 37:01.320]  I was trying to kick it right to them.
[37:01.700 --> 37:03.620]  So what's confusing about what I said?
[37:03.620 --> 37:05.160]  We are definitely doing this level again.
[37:05.160 --> 37:07.820]  Well, you see, it was after I'd already done the thing.
[37:08.340 --> 37:08.700]  No.
[37:08.880 --> 37:10.140]  So we're just gonna restart this one.
[37:10.160 --> 37:11.080]  No, it wasn't.
[37:11.540 --> 37:11.960]  It wasn't at all.
[37:11.960 --> 37:12.220]  No.
[37:13.300 --> 37:15.000]  Let me check in with the chat here.
[37:16.460 --> 37:18.920]  The Omni Optometrist, yeah.
[37:21.340 --> 37:22.760]  Oh, somebody said Ray played it too, huh?
[37:22.840 --> 37:23.200]  How about that?
[37:24.080 --> 37:25.620]  A Super Dictator.
[37:26.080 --> 37:26.860]  I don't know what that means.
[37:27.520 --> 37:28.660]  Nick is insane.
[37:29.100 --> 37:29.780]  There you go.
[37:30.820 --> 37:31.600]  How's the mouth?
[37:31.760 --> 37:32.260]  Oh, man.
[37:33.040 --> 37:36.300]  Listen to episode 20 of the Regulation Podcast.
[37:37.360 --> 37:37.840]  God.
[37:38.240 --> 37:38.720]  No!
[37:39.080 --> 37:39.880]  What a bounce!
[37:40.620 --> 37:40.860]  Nick.
[37:41.460 --> 37:43.280]  Okay, well, you got rid of that row, but...
[37:46.200 --> 37:46.680]  Nick.
[37:47.600 --> 37:48.320]  I'm not...
[37:48.320 --> 37:49.900]  I touched nothing.
[37:50.080 --> 37:50.420]  I know.
[37:50.420 --> 37:50.700]  Nothing?
[37:50.760 --> 37:51.000]  I know.
[37:51.120 --> 37:53.080]  I'm watching the consequences of your action.
[37:53.640 --> 37:54.140]  Right now.
[37:54.300 --> 37:54.720]  Or in action.
[37:54.920 --> 37:55.100]  Right now.
[37:55.300 --> 37:55.840]  Yeah, no kidding.
[37:56.280 --> 37:57.040]  There you go.
[37:58.040 --> 37:58.960]  Send it up there.
[37:59.160 --> 37:59.680]  That was nice.
[38:00.140 --> 38:00.840]  Thank you.
[38:00.840 --> 38:01.360]  Good kick.
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.580]  Send this that way.
[38:02.800 --> 38:03.520]  A little bounce.
[38:03.780 --> 38:05.060]  Wait for him to come to this guy.
[38:05.700 --> 38:06.140]  Straighten out.
[38:06.500 --> 38:07.440]  Throw it to that guy.
[38:07.480 --> 38:07.980]  Killing it.
[38:08.000 --> 38:08.400]  Got it.
[38:08.600 --> 38:09.140]  Killing it.
[38:09.140 --> 38:09.680]  Throw that way.
[38:10.020 --> 38:10.840]  Now throw that way.
[38:12.520 --> 38:13.200]  You see?
[38:13.380 --> 38:15.340]  It's a learning game, Eric.
[38:15.840 --> 38:17.100]  It's a learning game.
[38:17.320 --> 38:18.320]  Send it that way.
[38:18.500 --> 38:19.620]  That's three weeks away.
[38:19.840 --> 38:20.380]  No shit.
[38:20.580 --> 38:21.260]  That is three weeks away.
[38:21.660 --> 38:22.320]  We're a little bit ahead.
[38:22.420 --> 38:22.680]  What's that?
[38:23.540 --> 38:24.320]  Episode 20.
[38:25.160 --> 38:26.400]  I think 17 just came out.
[38:26.920 --> 38:27.220]  Yep.
[38:27.280 --> 38:28.440]  We've recorded through 19.
[38:28.700 --> 38:30.160]  We record 20 next week, I assume.
[38:30.160 --> 38:31.080]  Yeah, we have to.
[38:31.180 --> 38:31.580]  20 and 21.
[38:32.260 --> 38:35.900]  Okay, now kick it to them and let them kick it by you.
[38:37.540 --> 38:37.980]  Yeah!
[38:38.780 --> 38:40.580]  Okay, last time it was not going that way.
[38:40.900 --> 38:41.940]  It would have.
[38:42.180 --> 38:43.780]  Yeah, you just kept doing stuff.
[38:44.340 --> 38:44.680]  Stop.
[38:44.780 --> 38:45.360]  I don't think so.
[38:45.440 --> 38:46.540]  Now get it by them.
[38:47.760 --> 38:48.420]  What'd you say?
[38:48.560 --> 38:49.180]  There you go.
[38:51.780 --> 38:52.640]  Come on, Nick.
[38:52.780 --> 38:53.140]  Nice!
[38:53.140 --> 38:53.740]  There you go.
[38:53.920 --> 38:54.600]  Oh, shit.
[38:54.840 --> 38:55.400]  Oh, big goalie.
[38:55.980 --> 38:56.260]  Oh!
[38:56.920 --> 38:57.800]  Bear goalie.
[38:59.020 --> 39:00.460]  Oh, what if it just went off the course?
[39:00.460 --> 39:01.660]  Oh, that's what I was ready for.
[39:02.140 --> 39:03.420]  Sorry to hear that, RenegadeNobody.
[39:03.480 --> 39:04.640]  I got the wisdom teeth out yesterday.
[39:04.780 --> 39:05.260]  That's the worst.
[39:05.260 --> 39:05.540]  Ooh, yuck.
[39:05.760 --> 39:07.120]  Oh, that is the...
[39:07.120 --> 39:07.320]  Yeah.
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.880]  I did that when I was 16, so I barely remember it.
[39:10.300 --> 39:11.440]  Oh, nice, Nick!
[39:11.560 --> 39:12.560]  Enjoy your Percocet.
[39:12.620 --> 39:12.920]  Thank you!
[39:15.300 --> 39:16.680]  They didn't give me that shit.
[39:17.040 --> 39:18.800]  Did you get the hydrocodone or whatever?
[39:18.920 --> 39:19.700]  They just give you the Tylenol?
[39:19.700 --> 39:24.320]  No, I just realized my dad was like, just get him the extra strength Tylenol.
[39:24.420 --> 39:24.780]  Why?
[39:25.120 --> 39:25.600]  Oh, yeah.
[39:25.680 --> 39:27.240]  Because your dad doesn't like...
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.940]  Oh, your dad's a fucking dentist, too, man.
[39:29.980 --> 39:30.840]  That makes it even worse.
[39:30.920 --> 39:31.260]  He's an endodontist.
[39:31.320 --> 39:32.120]  He's an endodontist.
[39:32.200 --> 39:32.460]  He does root canals.
[39:32.820 --> 39:33.080]  Yeah.
[39:33.320 --> 39:34.000]  Oh, your dad was really not liking it.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.040]  Yeah, if anyone was going to be getting perks, dude, it's you.
[39:36.080 --> 39:36.660]  What the hell?
[39:38.060 --> 39:38.700]  Oh, well...
[39:39.240 --> 39:40.120]  I don't think my...
[39:40.120 --> 39:40.360]  Ooh!
[39:43.480 --> 39:46.700]  Oh, I see.
[39:50.940 --> 39:51.800]  Kick it over his head.
[39:55.040 --> 39:55.360]  Okay.
[39:55.360 --> 39:56.760]  How the hell do I do that?
[39:57.360 --> 39:58.800]  Oh, I just kick the shit out of him.
[40:00.280 --> 40:01.360]  Yeah, just like Rocket League.
[40:01.480 --> 40:02.020]  Driving the goal.
[40:02.820 --> 40:03.080]  Yeah!
[40:03.560 --> 40:03.900]  Nice.
[40:04.140 --> 40:05.320]  Oh, I got my own goal!
[40:06.060 --> 40:06.660]  Way to go, dude.
[40:07.500 --> 40:09.640]  Hey, man, they're like us playing Rocket League sometimes.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.480]  Don't worry, he's on your team, apparently.
[40:13.520 --> 40:14.000]  Thanks, Bear.
[40:15.120 --> 40:15.700]  Nailed it.
[40:15.900 --> 40:16.300]  Nice!
[40:16.620 --> 40:17.440]  Got it!
[40:19.320 --> 40:20.680]  That's why they call it the boot.
[40:22.220 --> 40:22.620]  Italy?
[40:23.760 --> 40:24.200]  Das Boot?
[40:24.800 --> 40:26.940]  The trunk in a British car, the boot.
[40:27.540 --> 40:28.180]  Das Boot.
[40:28.560 --> 40:29.280]  As your foot comes out.
[40:29.420 --> 40:29.680]  Das Boot.
[40:30.820 --> 40:32.680]  They don't make submarine movies anymore.
[40:33.120 --> 40:33.700]  Somebody said...
[40:33.700 --> 40:34.680]  No, I don't think...
[40:34.680 --> 40:36.260]  I don't think submarines are prevalent anymore.
[40:37.000 --> 40:37.940]  Are they prevalent in October?
[40:38.700 --> 40:38.960]  Yeah.
[40:39.220 --> 40:40.280]  I just don't think...
[40:40.280 --> 40:42.860]  I don't think they're in the zeitgeist the way they used to be.
[40:42.960 --> 40:43.320]  Yeah.
[40:43.520 --> 40:44.000]  Left side.
[40:45.360 --> 40:46.660]  Out of the way, crab.
[40:53.420 --> 40:54.880]  Oh, I have to sneeze so bad.
[40:55.120 --> 40:55.800]  Do it. Sneeze.
[40:55.960 --> 40:56.400]  Then sneeze!
[40:57.120 --> 40:58.680]  Oh, nope. I said it and it went away.
[40:59.220 --> 40:59.980]  That's how it works.
[41:00.360 --> 41:02.860]  Hey, Andrew, I don't think you ever really had to sneeze, dude.
[41:03.460 --> 41:03.940]  Oh, you don't sneeze?
[41:03.960 --> 41:04.920]  Is there sort of a sneeze effect?
[41:05.840 --> 41:06.020]  Yep.
[41:06.600 --> 41:07.980]  Yeah, I just wanted to...
[41:07.980 --> 41:09.500]  Are you a sneeze denier, Eric?
[41:09.840 --> 41:11.840]  Yeah, definitely. When it comes to Nick, absolutely.
[41:12.120 --> 41:13.120]  I think he's just trying...
[41:13.120 --> 41:14.900]  Anything to get sympathy, ma'am.
[41:17.300 --> 41:17.820]  Sympathy-thing?
[41:19.840 --> 41:20.160]  Nice!
[41:20.640 --> 41:22.700]  I thought this would have done something, too.
[41:23.220 --> 41:24.500]  You gotta go...
[41:24.500 --> 41:24.800]  Oh.
[41:25.300 --> 41:25.500]  Okay.
[41:25.500 --> 41:26.920]  I was just saying go left.
[41:27.040 --> 41:28.100]  You got it. It's fine. You're good.
[41:28.960 --> 41:30.940]  Hold A to kick hard. Oh, to the right, Nick.
[41:31.360 --> 41:32.120]  Nick doesn't care.
[41:33.960 --> 41:34.780]  That's a real...
[41:34.780 --> 41:35.740]  Yeah, Nick doesn't give a fuck.
[41:36.480 --> 41:37.520]  About what? Oh, okay.
[41:37.600 --> 41:38.400]  Oh, my God.
[41:38.480 --> 41:39.900]  Oh, my God!
[41:42.160 --> 41:43.880]  It's like the craziest shit.
[41:44.160 --> 41:44.660]  Like, how...
[41:44.660 --> 41:46.340]  I think you really need your...
[41:46.340 --> 41:47.060]  Like, we were joking.
[41:47.400 --> 41:48.860]  I think you really need your eyes checked.
[41:49.260 --> 41:50.200]  I wasn't, though.
[41:50.680 --> 41:53.140]  I did think that I blinded myself during the eclipse.
[41:53.480 --> 41:54.560]  Yeah, that was true.
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.760]  We talked about that next week on 100% Eat.
[41:58.940 --> 42:03.800]  We get down to the bottom of Nick really causing panic for himself.
[42:04.480 --> 42:06.120]  Yeah, it's good shit.
[42:06.900 --> 42:07.860]  Had a lot of fun.
[42:08.340 --> 42:14.720]  Watching Nick try this the exact same way over and over again and get the exact same result over and over again is fascinating.
[42:14.880 --> 42:15.420]  I got it!
[42:15.940 --> 42:16.420]  See?
[42:16.920 --> 42:17.480]  I was nuts.
[42:17.480 --> 42:18.460]  What about...
[42:18.460 --> 42:19.560]  You didn't do anything...
[42:20.080 --> 42:20.540]  What you...
[42:20.540 --> 42:21.600]  Oh, my God.
[42:21.680 --> 42:22.600]  I'm gonna beat this guy up.
[42:22.600 --> 42:23.500]  I did things different.
[42:24.560 --> 42:25.540]  Let's see here.
[42:27.540 --> 42:28.060]  Oh!
[42:28.840 --> 42:29.840]  Yeah, I didn't guess at all.
[42:29.840 --> 42:30.180]  You barely did.
[42:30.740 --> 42:32.720]  This is like the impossible to fail level.
[42:33.100 --> 42:33.980]  Jesus Christ.
[42:37.770 --> 42:39.530]  I remember one time...
[42:39.530 --> 42:40.370]  Shit, dude.
[42:41.250 --> 42:44.090]  I told this to Eric when I was telling him...
[42:44.090 --> 42:44.690]  There you go.
[42:45.070 --> 42:46.290]  Oh, that's it.
[42:46.630 --> 42:47.310]  Oh, what the...
[42:47.970 --> 42:48.790]  I'm gonna get multiple.
[42:50.390 --> 42:51.450]  Oh, Christ.
[42:52.890 --> 42:53.930]  Tell your story.
[42:54.830 --> 42:55.210]  We got time.
[42:56.210 --> 42:57.410]  So, we went...
[42:57.410 --> 43:00.210]  We were talking about the future of regulation and...
[43:01.290 --> 43:02.370]  What is the future of regulation?
[43:02.610 --> 43:02.950]  Clue us in.
[43:03.330 --> 43:03.650]  No, no, no.
[43:03.690 --> 43:05.650]  This is back when we were...
[43:05.650 --> 43:07.510]  We met at Hank's for coffee.
[43:08.090 --> 43:08.750]  Oh, that's right.
[43:08.930 --> 43:09.630]  Oh, dude.
[43:09.790 --> 43:10.930]  This was crazy, Geoff.
[43:12.830 --> 43:16.890]  So, at one point, I started, like, putting the drink on the back of my neck.
[43:17.270 --> 43:17.550]  Uh-huh.
[43:17.770 --> 43:22.650]  And you were like, oh, I hear that people who have panic attacks do that to stop the panic attack.
[43:23.290 --> 43:24.530]  Are you having a panic attack?
[43:24.530 --> 43:25.170]  And I said, no.
[43:25.670 --> 43:27.230]  And I was having a panic attack.
[43:27.390 --> 43:28.010]  Are you serious?
[43:28.370 --> 43:28.570]  Yeah.
[43:28.670 --> 43:29.510]  Oh, dude, I was.
[43:30.030 --> 43:31.450]  But I was like, oh, Geoff knows.
[43:31.590 --> 43:32.250]  I can't let him know.
[43:32.550 --> 43:32.990]  I can't let him know.
[43:33.790 --> 43:35.810]  I think I had just seen it on TV or something.
[43:35.990 --> 43:36.150]  Yep.
[43:37.850 --> 43:38.910]  That's what I told Eric.
[43:38.910 --> 43:41.110]  I think I was like, I'd seen it on TV the night before or something.
[43:42.450 --> 43:44.910]  Oh, yeah, well, I guess I had to.
[43:45.230 --> 43:45.530]  Uh-huh.
[43:46.370 --> 43:47.150]  It did help.
[43:48.610 --> 43:49.490]  It was so funny.
[43:50.750 --> 43:51.370]  Oh, my God.
[43:51.370 --> 43:57.190]  And the next episode of 100% Eat has more of that from Nick and us going, is this guy okay?
[43:57.370 --> 43:58.150]  The answer's no.
[43:58.670 --> 44:05.170]  To be fair, that was an exceptionally panicky time.
[44:05.630 --> 44:06.290]  It was.
[44:06.410 --> 44:07.250]  It definitely was.
[44:07.510 --> 44:09.170]  This time at Carrabba's was not.
[44:12.710 --> 44:14.590]  Well, I have a theory on that, Eric.
[44:14.790 --> 44:15.110]  Oh, yeah?
[44:15.150 --> 44:15.630]  Uh-oh.
[44:16.050 --> 44:20.810]  Yeah, and it has to do with the thing that I had before I left the office.
[44:20.810 --> 44:21.530]  Oh, that makes sense.
[44:21.730 --> 44:21.850]  Go to the book.
[44:22.050 --> 44:23.150]  That sounds like a good thing.
[44:23.150 --> 44:24.130]  Go to the book!
[44:25.090 --> 44:25.890]  What book?
[44:26.690 --> 44:26.750]  Jesus Christ!
[44:27.790 --> 44:28.490]  There's a book?
[44:28.730 --> 44:29.550]  To the left!
[44:31.450 --> 44:32.330]  Okay, thank you.
[44:32.390 --> 44:33.830]  I was just curious what was over there.
[44:35.450 --> 44:35.750]  I love this.
[44:35.750 --> 44:37.850]  It opened on the way you came back.
[44:38.150 --> 44:39.070]  I love this so much.
[44:39.070 --> 44:39.450]  This is great.
[44:39.650 --> 44:41.190]  Andrew, this is like...
[44:41.630 --> 44:42.510]  This is how I feel when...
[44:42.510 --> 44:43.570]  This is what it's like when I'm playing.
[44:43.750 --> 44:44.050]  Yeah.
[44:44.490 --> 44:45.030]  I get it.
[44:45.330 --> 44:46.110]  It's really special.
[44:46.410 --> 44:46.790]  It's really special.
[44:46.790 --> 44:49.190]  And I understand what Nick's going through, too, because he's locked in.
[44:49.190 --> 44:50.870]  Yeah, I'm locked in.
[44:50.930 --> 44:52.670]  I understand all perspectives now.
[44:52.890 --> 44:53.190]  Right.
[44:53.490 --> 44:54.550]  Alright, gotta do this one.
[44:54.630 --> 44:55.770]  Then we'll go across to Deathville.
[44:55.830 --> 44:56.550]  Great call, Nick.
[44:56.590 --> 44:57.210]  I didn't even notice.
[44:57.570 --> 44:58.430]  Thank you.
[44:59.250 --> 45:00.270]  Very observant.
[45:01.590 --> 45:03.050]  Hit the ball, Jack!
[45:04.430 --> 45:04.990]  I...
[45:04.990 --> 45:06.630]  I think...
[45:06.630 --> 45:07.550]  Yeah, I...
[45:07.550 --> 45:08.070]  Oh, okay.
[45:10.630 --> 45:14.990]  I think it was a combo of alcohol slash caffeine.
[45:15.170 --> 45:15.350]  Yep.
[45:16.150 --> 45:16.530]  Yep.
[45:17.590 --> 45:25.510]  Nick, just in the middle of it, just, like, got up, and, like, stood up, and then sat down, and then stood up, and then walked away and did finger guns.
[45:26.330 --> 45:26.970]  It was...
[45:26.970 --> 45:28.890]  It was fucking great.
[45:28.890 --> 45:29.530]  I was like...
[45:30.170 --> 45:30.950]  Back to the left!
[45:31.250 --> 45:31.610]  Coming up!
[45:31.730 --> 45:32.370]  Coming up to the left!
[45:32.830 --> 45:33.750]  Alright, coming up to the left.
[45:33.850 --> 45:36.370]  I was like, if I do something kind of funny, maybe...
[45:36.370 --> 45:36.650]  It was...
[45:36.650 --> 45:37.410]  Or, like, stupid...
[45:37.410 --> 45:38.150]  It was so funny.
[45:38.150 --> 45:39.150]  It'll look like I'm okay.
[45:39.430 --> 45:39.930]  It was...
[45:39.930 --> 45:41.230]  No, it was insane.
[45:41.350 --> 45:42.590]  It was so funny, dude.
[45:42.690 --> 45:43.770]  It was...
[45:43.770 --> 45:46.570]  This next episode of 100% Eat is a fucking mess.
[45:46.790 --> 45:48.050]  Like, I don't think we should release it.
[45:48.150 --> 45:48.770]  It's really bad.
[45:49.030 --> 45:49.970]  What are you talking about?
[45:50.130 --> 45:50.950]  It's so bad.
[45:51.270 --> 45:51.610]  It is...
[45:51.610 --> 45:53.670]  It's for drunk people and me.
[45:55.090 --> 45:56.510]  I was pretty sober by then.
[45:56.690 --> 45:59.490]  Yeah, I could tell by the way you kept saying Stone Cold Sober.
[46:00.370 --> 46:04.050]  No, but I was Stone Cold Sober because of the panic attack.
[46:04.170 --> 46:04.930]  Let me tell you...
[46:04.930 --> 46:05.410]  Nice!
[46:05.670 --> 46:07.390]  ...how quickly that can erase a lot of alcohol.
[46:07.390 --> 46:08.170]  Whoa, the bears are stealing it!
[46:08.270 --> 46:08.630]  Go!
[46:08.850 --> 46:09.070]  Go!
[46:09.090 --> 46:09.350]  Go!
[46:10.010 --> 46:13.070]  That was theft.
[46:13.890 --> 46:15.630]  Eric, you know that part of town we were in today?
[46:15.750 --> 46:17.230]  We were doing the AMA thing?
[46:17.670 --> 46:17.870]  Uh-huh.
[46:18.170 --> 46:19.510]  I saw the other day...
[46:19.510 --> 46:20.570]  I saw a building...
[46:20.570 --> 46:21.170]  I just don't...
[46:21.170 --> 46:26.950]  I just don't understand why you were, like, cagey about it and then said what we were doing.
[46:27.430 --> 46:28.070]  Oh, I don't know.
[46:28.330 --> 46:30.450]  I don't think there's any reason to be cagey about it.
[46:30.610 --> 46:31.250]  We were recording AMA.
[46:31.430 --> 46:32.690]  I thought you were being cagey about it.
[46:32.750 --> 46:33.910]  But I don't think we should be cagey about it.
[46:33.930 --> 46:35.870]  But then you said...
[46:36.470 --> 46:40.410]  You know the part of town where you were in secret for the secret project we were doing?
[46:40.890 --> 46:43.470]  No, no, I just don't want to say the part of town because I don't want to spoil the episode.
[46:43.470 --> 46:44.530]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:44.530 --> 46:44.990]  Okay, cool.
[46:46.390 --> 46:47.030]  I got...
[46:47.030 --> 46:47.570]  Yeah, that made sense.
[46:47.650 --> 46:48.030]  Oh, my God.
[46:48.570 --> 46:50.530]  Nick and I are on the same page, and that scares me.
[46:50.670 --> 46:51.390]  That sucks.
[46:51.770 --> 46:52.410]  That should...
[46:52.410 --> 46:52.990]  You should be...
[46:52.990 --> 46:54.030]  Hey, you should be worried.
[46:54.330 --> 46:56.050]  So I got some shit to figure out there.
[46:57.170 --> 47:01.510]  Anyway, I saw the other day in that part of town a building, like a house that was for rent,
[47:01.570 --> 47:04.450]  that was commercial, that I sent to Gavin just as a, like, hey, look at this.
[47:04.470 --> 47:04.950]  This would be cool.
[47:05.290 --> 47:07.370]  You know, like, maybe someday if we ever get a business.
[47:08.690 --> 47:11.430]  And today, Emily asked about it, and I showed her the picture.
[47:11.510 --> 47:12.510]  So she called about it.
[47:12.510 --> 47:13.270]  Uh-huh.
[47:13.330 --> 47:17.370]  It was a 3,000-square-foot house, two-story, just, like, on a busy business street.
[47:17.790 --> 47:21.610]  And on the street we were on, how much do you think the rent would be a month for that house?
[47:22.410 --> 47:24.010]  For 3,000 square feet?
[47:24.110 --> 47:24.590]  Is that what you said?
[47:24.590 --> 47:24.650]  Yeah.
[47:24.890 --> 47:26.410]  Yeah, it's pretty nice inside.
[47:26.670 --> 47:27.410]  3,000 square feet.
[47:27.910 --> 47:29.730]  It's gotta be $4,200 at least.
[47:32.030 --> 47:34.150]  It was $69,000 a month.
[47:34.570 --> 47:35.010]  Oh, my God.
[47:35.010 --> 47:35.290]  What?
[47:36.270 --> 47:37.210]  What did you say?
[47:37.390 --> 47:38.770]  $69,000 a month.
[47:39.090 --> 47:39.210]  It was...
[47:39.210 --> 47:41.630]  Hey, hey, get real.
[47:41.630 --> 47:43.130]  Are you kidding me?
[47:43.150 --> 47:44.030]  Please open the chest.
[47:44.330 --> 47:44.930]  Please don't.
[47:45.350 --> 47:46.470]  We'll do it after.
[47:46.610 --> 47:46.970]  We'll do it after.
[47:47.130 --> 47:47.530]  We'll do it after.
[47:47.710 --> 47:47.950]  We'll do it after.
[47:47.970 --> 47:49.030]  I might spit you out.
[47:49.670 --> 47:51.090]  I just, like, it's...
[47:51.690 --> 47:52.070]  Whatever.
[47:52.370 --> 47:53.290]  I'm with the bear.
[47:53.430 --> 47:54.190]  You shouldn't be here.
[47:54.790 --> 47:56.210]  It's supposed to be impossible.
[47:56.930 --> 47:57.750]  Were you saying something?
[47:58.890 --> 48:00.110]  Just give up and go back.
[48:00.210 --> 48:00.810]  I'm with the bear.
[48:05.710 --> 48:06.090]  Oh.
[48:07.470 --> 48:08.230]  Backflips back.
[48:08.410 --> 48:09.030]  All right.
[48:09.150 --> 48:09.790]  I don't get the reference.
[48:09.790 --> 48:11.370]  Ba-ba-da-ba.
[48:15.070 --> 48:15.430]  Insync.
[48:15.870 --> 48:16.070]  Geoff.
[48:16.690 --> 48:18.170]  I sang the reference, dude.
[48:18.310 --> 48:19.410]  I was making a joke.
[48:19.910 --> 48:21.210]  No, I was explaining the reference.
[48:21.210 --> 48:21.610]  Thank you.
[48:21.710 --> 48:22.030]  Thank you.
[48:22.090 --> 48:22.450]  I appreciate it.
[48:22.790 --> 48:25.330]  Hey, did you get that joke you were saying, Geoff, or no?
[48:25.790 --> 48:26.050]  No.
[48:26.130 --> 48:26.430]  What joke?
[48:26.830 --> 48:27.070]  Yeah.
[48:28.070 --> 48:28.830]  The insync one.
[48:30.350 --> 48:31.870]  I don't think we're in sync at all right now.
[48:32.530 --> 48:33.170]  I disagree.
[48:33.590 --> 48:35.750]  I definitely think you're a couple of Backstreet Boys.
[48:35.890 --> 48:36.370]  That's for sure.
[48:36.370 --> 48:36.770]  Oh.
[48:38.650 --> 48:39.730]  Ba-ba-bye.
[48:42.010 --> 48:42.790]  Out of the way.
[48:46.550 --> 48:47.430]  Oh, boy.
[48:53.210 --> 48:57.670]  Can you imagine if your belly button was a leg that you could just shoot out like that?
[48:57.990 --> 48:58.190]  Yeah.
[48:58.390 --> 48:59.930]  I don't like thinking about that.
[49:00.290 --> 49:00.730]  Terrible.
[49:01.070 --> 49:02.570]  Thank you, Captain Curry, for the five gifted.
[49:02.850 --> 49:03.410]  Appreciate you.
[49:03.810 --> 49:04.490]  Steph Curry?
[49:04.930 --> 49:05.850]  Yeah, Steph Curry.
[49:05.950 --> 49:06.270]  Wow.
[49:06.930 --> 49:08.330]  I rooted for you one time.
[49:08.410 --> 49:09.050]  It felt pretty good.
[49:09.050 --> 49:10.670]  Is that what it was like to root for you all the time?
[49:13.570 --> 49:17.630]  I wonder how many people rooted for Steph Curry for the first time in their lives during the Olympics.
[49:18.090 --> 49:19.250]  I was definitely one of them.
[49:19.330 --> 49:20.010]  I was one of them.
[49:20.210 --> 49:20.710]  I was.
[49:20.810 --> 49:21.330]  I was.
[49:21.730 --> 49:25.470]  It is a little like, it's so fucking easy to be a fan of you.
[49:25.630 --> 49:25.810]  Jesus.
[49:25.810 --> 49:27.830]  Yeah, it felt pretty special to root.
[49:27.870 --> 49:29.590]  And I'm just like, wow, this guy's really good.
[49:29.790 --> 49:31.590]  When he's on your team, this is how it feels.
[49:31.630 --> 49:32.290]  It's pretty impressive.
[49:33.770 --> 49:34.130]  Ow.
[49:34.910 --> 49:35.270]  Ow.
[49:35.510 --> 49:36.090]  Good job, Nick.
[49:37.250 --> 49:37.610]  Oh.
[49:37.610 --> 49:38.430]  Dang.
[49:39.290 --> 49:39.950]  Go around the scratch.
[49:40.810 --> 49:41.270]  There you go.
[49:41.370 --> 49:41.770]  You got it.
[49:41.830 --> 49:42.770]  Or bash through them either way.
[49:42.890 --> 49:43.150]  It's fine.
[49:43.530 --> 49:44.430]  Oh, sharp turn!
[49:44.990 --> 49:47.610]  Let me tell you that this is a very...
[49:49.250 --> 49:50.390]  Oh, boy!
[49:50.630 --> 49:50.730]  No!
[49:51.910 --> 49:52.770]  Do it again!
[49:52.870 --> 49:53.370]  Do it again!
[49:53.470 --> 49:54.030]  Do it again!
[49:54.250 --> 49:54.490]  Oh.
[49:57.590 --> 49:58.630]  This is what the car.
[49:59.210 --> 50:01.830]  This is why the bear said, give up, bitch.
[50:02.170 --> 50:03.270]  It's impossible, idiot.
[50:03.950 --> 50:04.950]  I'm gonna kill that bear.
[50:04.950 --> 50:06.750]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[50:08.550 --> 50:09.370]  Cool flips.
[50:09.550 --> 50:09.770]  Oh.
[50:10.170 --> 50:10.430]  Ow.
[50:11.510 --> 50:12.390]  Alright, let's go through.
[50:12.390 --> 50:14.110]  Wait, when you kick forward, does it propel you forward?
[50:14.450 --> 50:15.030]  Like, do you get faster?
[50:15.110 --> 50:15.290]  Ow! Ow!
[50:15.550 --> 50:17.010]  Uh, kinda?
[50:17.250 --> 50:17.650]  Don't know why.
[50:17.650 --> 50:21.650]  I don't know why you would test it right here when you are trying your best to make it through.
[50:22.650 --> 50:23.090]  Like...
[50:23.090 --> 50:23.430]  Woo!
[50:24.810 --> 50:25.730]  Oh my god.
[50:26.310 --> 50:28.090]  Alright, quiet on set!
[50:28.970 --> 50:29.410]  Drift!
[50:29.870 --> 50:30.570]  You got it.
[50:30.630 --> 50:31.170]  Oh, why would...
[50:31.170 --> 50:32.190]  Oh, take the shortcut.
[50:32.590 --> 50:33.150]  I don't know.
[50:33.150 --> 50:33.990]  We learned.
[50:34.610 --> 50:35.610]  I didn't learn shit.
[50:35.670 --> 50:35.850]  Alright.
[50:37.350 --> 50:37.710]  Well...
[50:38.190 --> 50:41.330]  Hey, did you see Matthew Fox is gonna be in that Yellowstone show?
[50:42.090 --> 50:42.950]  No, is he really?
[50:43.210 --> 50:43.270]  Yeah.
[50:43.270 --> 50:44.930]  Is he replacing, uh, what's his face?
[50:45.110 --> 50:45.710]  I guess so.
[50:45.710 --> 50:45.930]  Kevin Costner?
[50:46.050 --> 50:47.090]  He, um...
[50:47.090 --> 50:48.950]  Seems like Kevin Costner could use the work right now.
[50:49.050 --> 50:49.230]  Yeah.
[50:49.670 --> 50:51.430]  He looks a little rough around the edges.
[50:51.750 --> 50:52.090]  Good job.
[50:52.230 --> 50:52.630]  Oh, really?
[50:52.790 --> 50:54.650]  He's gotta be getting pretty up there, right?
[50:54.670 --> 50:55.150]  He's up there.
[50:55.250 --> 50:55.750]  He's up there.
[50:55.830 --> 50:57.210]  He doesn't look bad.
[50:57.410 --> 50:59.610]  It's just a thing where you go, oh, that's not what I...
[50:59.610 --> 51:01.810]  Like, he doesn't look buff anymore.
[51:02.410 --> 51:03.750]  I remember him...
[51:03.750 --> 51:05.090]  I guess from Lost.
[51:05.250 --> 51:06.930]  I always think of Party of Five for some reason.
[51:07.350 --> 51:07.550]  Yeah, Party of Five.
[51:07.550 --> 51:07.770]  Yeah, Party of Five.
[51:07.910 --> 51:09.370]  Oh, I didn't know he was on Party of Five.
[51:09.450 --> 51:10.530]  Yeah, he was one of the five.
[51:10.650 --> 51:11.530]  Yeah, he was like the older brother that kept it all together, yeah.
[51:11.670 --> 51:11.810]  Yep.
[51:12.070 --> 51:12.210]  Huh.
[51:12.850 --> 51:15.290]  Oh, you got the golden boot.
[51:17.130 --> 51:17.870]  The golden boot.
[51:17.870 --> 51:18.630]  Johnny Golden Boots?
[51:19.450 --> 51:20.810]  Yeah, is that another one of your guys?
[51:21.610 --> 51:23.970]  That was a movie, I wanna say, when I was a kid.
[51:24.790 --> 51:26.630]  I think it was Like Mike, but with soccer.
[51:27.010 --> 51:28.290]  Well, I guess we gotta watch that.
[51:29.890 --> 51:30.830]  Johnny Golden Boot?
[51:30.830 --> 51:31.990]  Look it up.
[51:32.050 --> 51:33.150]  Did you make that up?
[51:33.430 --> 51:34.710]  I don't think so.
[51:35.290 --> 51:36.250]  Oh, Christ.
[51:36.770 --> 51:39.910]  It's like a British kid and he gets golden soccer cleats.
[51:40.190 --> 51:43.350]  I just, I assume you're...
[51:43.350 --> 51:44.970]  I assume you're making it up.
[51:44.970 --> 51:48.130]  And he starts becoming really good at soccer and he wasn't good before?
[51:48.590 --> 51:50.330]  Is it a movie called Golden Shoes?
[51:50.850 --> 51:51.190]  Maybe.
[51:52.830 --> 51:54.550]  Is there a character named Johnny in it?
[51:56.270 --> 51:59.390]  Maybe I just played soccer with a kid named Johnny.
[52:01.610 --> 52:02.730]  This is insane.
[52:02.930 --> 52:04.050]  Maybe that was his nickname.
[52:04.210 --> 52:05.890]  Maybe I played soccer with a kid named Johnny.
[52:06.010 --> 52:06.450]  That was his nickname.
[52:06.610 --> 52:07.610]  But there is a movie.
[52:08.250 --> 52:09.690]  It's everyone saying totally made up.
[52:09.770 --> 52:11.410]  Zero results for Johnny Golden Boots.
[52:11.590 --> 52:15.290]  Okay, well look up, is there a movie where a kid gets golden soccer cleats?
[52:15.630 --> 52:16.330]  Right, I looked up.
[52:16.410 --> 52:17.490]  But this is from 2015.
[52:17.750 --> 52:19.150]  Golden Shoes is from 2015.
[52:19.290 --> 52:20.470]  I can't imagine that that's what it is.
[52:20.470 --> 52:21.330]  No, no, no.
[52:21.490 --> 52:23.250]  This is like 2002.
[52:25.150 --> 52:26.210]  This is a real movie.
[52:26.290 --> 52:28.110]  There's no way I made this movie up.
[52:28.110 --> 52:30.470]  Like Mike, but soccer.
[52:31.330 --> 52:35.590]  Andrew, I think you made this movie up.
[52:35.810 --> 52:38.510]  No, I have such clear memories of what the cleats looked like.
[52:38.530 --> 52:40.610]  You need to start looking it up.
[52:41.010 --> 52:41.210]  Oh, no.
[52:41.870 --> 52:44.230]  2002 is when Like Mike came out.
[52:45.230 --> 52:46.270]  It was around then.
[52:46.930 --> 52:48.270]  It was pre-2004.
[52:49.410 --> 52:51.210]  It was like 1999 to 2002.
[52:51.730 --> 52:56.090]  Did you maybe make up a movie in your head to compete with Like Mike, but about soccer?
[52:57.570 --> 52:59.370]  Was Simbad a genie in it?
[53:00.770 --> 53:04.210]  Did Johnny Golden Boot look anything like you by chance?
[53:04.450 --> 53:04.750]  No.
[53:06.090 --> 53:07.770]  He dressed up like James Bond.
[53:09.830 --> 53:11.910]  Did he have an alien blaster from Minimal Life?
[53:12.050 --> 53:13.190]  This is going to drive me crazy.
[53:13.290 --> 53:15.210]  As soon as we're done, I'm going deep on this.
[53:16.650 --> 53:18.150]  Just look it up now.
[53:18.330 --> 53:19.370]  Is it Bendit like Beckham?
[53:20.590 --> 53:21.070]  No.
[53:21.430 --> 53:22.490]  Was it Keira Knightley?
[53:22.910 --> 53:23.390]  No.
[53:24.630 --> 53:25.470]  What the hell?
[53:26.230 --> 53:27.230]  Was it Love Actually?
[53:27.510 --> 53:28.110]  It reminded me of Mario Party.
[53:28.290 --> 53:28.630]  No.
[53:30.330 --> 53:30.870]  Love Actually.
[53:33.750 --> 53:35.510]  People are saying Golden Shoes sound similar.
[53:35.630 --> 53:36.630]  Right, but it's from 2015.
[53:36.910 --> 53:38.910]  It does not seem like it's the thing that Andrew is talking about.
[53:38.910 --> 53:39.430]  It is not.
[53:39.590 --> 53:40.530]  No, this is not.
[53:40.610 --> 53:41.450]  I saw this as a child.
[53:42.430 --> 53:43.190]  Roll, Nick!
[53:46.050 --> 53:46.910]  I did it!
[53:46.930 --> 53:47.210]  Recover!
[53:48.470 --> 53:51.970]  Dude, Tri-Band didn't want you to succeed and you said, fuck you.
[53:52.310 --> 53:52.970]  Alright, get over there left.
[53:54.350 --> 53:55.070]  I see it!
[53:55.070 --> 53:56.450]  Oh, he's scared up!
[53:58.230 --> 53:58.630]  Yahoo!
[53:59.390 --> 53:59.790]  Nice!
[54:00.510 --> 54:01.390]  In the goal!
[54:03.710 --> 54:05.050]  I remember the big green.
[54:05.510 --> 54:08.530]  The big green is not what Andrew is talking about.
[54:08.630 --> 54:12.290]  The big green is like the Sandlot or Giants.
[54:13.270 --> 54:14.930]  Didn't I have the same kid from the Sandlot?
[54:15.250 --> 54:16.030]  Or am I making that up?
[54:16.190 --> 54:18.410]  You probably made that up like Andrew's Johnny Golden Boots.
[54:18.490 --> 54:19.670]  I don't think Johnny Golden Boots is in that.
[54:20.670 --> 54:22.030]  What the hell am I doing here?
[54:22.150 --> 54:22.910]  Go left, baby.
[54:24.190 --> 54:25.110]  What the?
[54:26.350 --> 54:27.890]  The controls are real weird.
[54:27.930 --> 54:29.100]  Andrew is thinking of ladybugs.
[54:30.230 --> 54:31.590]  Oh, I remember ladybugs.
[54:31.750 --> 54:34.130]  Yeah, was Roddy Dangerfield in it by any chance?
[54:34.890 --> 54:36.190]  I don't know, maybe.
[54:37.330 --> 54:39.370]  Turns out Andrew's much younger than he thought he was.
[54:41.990 --> 54:42.630]  What the?
[54:42.690 --> 54:44.150]  You have to keep holding left, dude.
[54:46.170 --> 54:47.470]  Let me do this.
[54:49.870 --> 54:51.150]  What the fuck?
[54:51.810 --> 54:52.290]  Whoa!
[54:53.390 --> 54:55.270]  Stop going that...
[54:55.270 --> 54:58.070]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[54:59.150 --> 54:59.850]  Not that.
[55:00.590 --> 55:01.070]  What?
[55:01.270 --> 55:02.270]  Here we go!
[55:02.710 --> 55:03.730]  Oh, this is really weird.
[55:04.690 --> 55:05.170]  Controls!
[55:05.330 --> 55:05.890]  I did it!
[55:07.770 --> 55:09.190]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[55:09.290 --> 55:09.730]  Not that.
[55:09.930 --> 55:11.310]  Why? Based on what?
[55:12.090 --> 55:12.350]  No!
[55:13.070 --> 55:14.330]  Nick, do it again.
[55:14.950 --> 55:15.490]  Do it again.
[55:15.670 --> 55:16.770]  You gotta do it again.
[55:17.190 --> 55:17.790]  Do it again.
[55:18.190 --> 55:19.090]  Gotta be done again.
[55:19.990 --> 55:20.930]  What the fuck?
[55:20.930 --> 55:22.070]  You have to keep holding left.
[55:23.010 --> 55:24.230]  That's what Eric keeps saying.
[55:24.730 --> 55:27.390]  So I'm not sure what the chat doesn't get when people are going,
[55:27.450 --> 55:30.170]  2015 movie, Golden Shoes, and it's like, it's not...
[55:32.250 --> 55:33.710]  We can't say that enough.
[55:35.030 --> 55:35.930]  I think I found it.
[55:36.190 --> 55:37.470]  Are you thinking, oh, what is it?
[55:37.790 --> 55:39.290]  You found it?
[55:39.830 --> 55:40.730]  I think I found it.
[55:41.090 --> 55:41.530]  What is it?
[55:42.250 --> 55:43.470]  Is it Golden Shoes?
[55:44.350 --> 55:45.510]  Is it Johnny Golden Boots?
[55:46.230 --> 55:48.190]  There's only one Jimmy Grimble.
[55:49.210 --> 55:49.730]  What?
[55:50.410 --> 55:52.790]  But there might not be Golden Shoes in this.
[55:52.970 --> 55:54.510]  Maybe I made up the golden part.
[55:55.050 --> 55:57.230]  Wait, what are you fucking talking about?
[55:57.490 --> 55:58.830]  Get over there, you little rat!
[55:58.830 --> 56:01.390]  There's only one Jimmy Grimble is the title of the movie.
[56:02.230 --> 56:04.850]  Sassy Sasquatch in the chat is what...
[56:04.850 --> 56:09.570]  Them and Kodank11 are the people that I saw that said that.
[56:09.730 --> 56:10.570]  So, good for them.
[56:11.390 --> 56:13.450]  It's got Robert Carlyle in it.
[56:14.890 --> 56:17.310]  I think you gotta knock this down first.
[56:19.250 --> 56:19.730]  Maybe.
[56:20.270 --> 56:23.050]  The DVD box says the best British film in ages.
[56:23.610 --> 56:27.110]  Jimmy Grimble is a shy Manchester boy.
[56:27.310 --> 56:28.490]  I think that's how you say it.
[56:28.790 --> 56:30.630]  It's not Manchester or whatever.
[56:31.030 --> 56:35.050]  School boy, however, through football and some special boots,
[56:35.310 --> 56:37.670]  he manages to gain the confidence to succeed.
[56:37.770 --> 56:39.210]  6.6 out of 10.
[56:40.650 --> 56:44.130]  I need to see the boots, though, because maybe I invented the fact that they were gold.
[56:44.550 --> 56:45.870]  I'm looking to see if there's boots.
[56:47.710 --> 56:50.130]  It appears that he is just wearing some shoes.
[56:50.710 --> 56:56.710]  They're just magic boots that used to belong to Robbie Brewer, who used to play for City.
[56:57.510 --> 56:57.770]  God damn it!
[56:58.570 --> 57:04.820]  Now, somebody named Gordon steals Jimmy's boots.
[57:04.960 --> 57:07.920]  Do you think maybe you're getting Gordon and Golden confused?
[57:08.520 --> 57:08.920]  Maybe.
[57:09.440 --> 57:11.040]  That's a distinct possibility.
[57:11.420 --> 57:11.660]  Yeah.
[57:12.120 --> 57:14.720]  Now, I'm gonna drop an image for you.
[57:14.940 --> 57:16.980]  I wanna see if you think this looks familiar.
[57:17.680 --> 57:19.400]  Do you think this looks familiar?
[57:20.480 --> 57:21.440]  Let's see.
[57:24.760 --> 57:29.100]  Is that the movie you watched, buddy?
[57:29.280 --> 57:29.840]  No!
[57:30.880 --> 57:36.240]  Is that the movie you watched?
[57:38.740 --> 57:40.400]  Yeah, that's it!
[57:40.980 --> 57:43.880]  So it is the Jimmy Grimble movie.
[57:44.120 --> 57:45.600]  Yeah, it's absolutely Jimmy Grimble.
[57:45.600 --> 57:46.780]  God damn it!
[57:47.100 --> 57:48.820]  Nick, that was 100% on you.
[57:49.180 --> 57:50.680]  All you had to do was go into it.
[57:51.860 --> 57:52.340]  You...
[57:52.340 --> 57:54.560]  Guys, we are only three minutes away from 5-0.
[57:54.560 --> 57:55.140]  Oh, Nick!
[57:55.300 --> 57:56.920]  Knock over the big thing.
[57:57.220 --> 57:59.280]  Go to the left and get over the boot.
[57:59.700 --> 58:02.460]  Grab the card, come back, and hit the goal.
[58:04.640 --> 58:05.120]  You...
[58:06.360 --> 58:14.420]  Guys, we may have to put in a regulation request for an extension past 5-0-1 if Nick's not able to do this in three minutes.
[58:14.420 --> 58:15.420]  Here we go.
[58:15.540 --> 58:15.840]  No!
[58:16.560 --> 58:19.020]  Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
[58:19.300 --> 58:19.900]  Quiet! Quiet!
[58:20.100 --> 58:20.320]  Okay.
[58:20.880 --> 58:21.360]  Okay.
[58:21.760 --> 58:21.960]  Alright.
[58:22.180 --> 58:22.700]  Nice!
[58:22.940 --> 58:24.960]  I got it. I don't know what the issue was.
[58:26.220 --> 58:27.300]  It's because...
[58:27.300 --> 58:28.420]  Good job, Nick!
[58:30.220 --> 58:33.100]  That was very, very tanky.
[58:35.460 --> 58:36.880]  Very, very tanky.
[58:36.900 --> 58:39.040]  He was all distracted with the Grimble Kimble.
[58:39.080 --> 58:40.180]  Yeah, he was Grimble Kimble.
[58:41.100 --> 58:43.260]  Looking at that image, I gotta tell ya.
[58:44.960 --> 58:45.800]  Oh my god!
[58:45.820 --> 58:46.900]  Oh my god!
[58:47.080 --> 58:48.620]  Alright, this might be the last level.
[58:48.760 --> 58:49.080]  Last level.
[58:49.500 --> 58:50.500]  Maybe. We'll see.
[58:50.580 --> 58:51.740]  See how fast he can do it.
[58:52.100 --> 58:52.180]  Oh!
[58:52.580 --> 58:53.860]  Why, Dr. Cannon?
[58:54.020 --> 58:54.520]  Fuck yeah.
[58:55.080 --> 58:55.620]  This rocks.
[58:55.640 --> 58:56.860]  Oh, the car's upside down?
[58:57.580 --> 58:58.580]  Oh, that's awesome.
[58:59.080 --> 58:59.740]  Oh, what the?
[58:59.880 --> 59:00.580]  I can't...
[59:00.580 --> 59:01.300]  Can I not steer?
[59:01.420 --> 59:02.020]  Oh, okay.
[59:02.140 --> 59:02.660]  That was weird.
[59:02.760 --> 59:03.100]  There you go.
[59:03.400 --> 59:05.680]  You gotta steer with the balls, right?
[59:06.080 --> 59:06.300]  Yep.
[59:06.860 --> 59:07.580]  Oh, how do I...
[59:08.240 --> 59:08.660]  How do you what?
[59:08.700 --> 59:09.080]  You just go.
[59:10.200 --> 59:10.820]  But then the car...
[59:10.820 --> 59:11.420]  Oh, click the middle!
[59:11.800 --> 59:12.080]  No!
[59:12.300 --> 59:12.820]  Click the middle!
[59:12.820 --> 59:14.160]  Where, where, where, where, where?
[59:14.500 --> 59:15.880]  It's back in the soccer balls on the right.
[59:16.200 --> 59:17.280]  Oh, it's in the soccer balls. Got it.
[59:17.680 --> 59:19.580]  Guys, welcome to the last level of the game.
[59:21.180 --> 59:24.260]  Wanna thank Tri-Band for giving us the code for this thing.
[59:25.040 --> 59:25.660]  Didn't see it.
[59:26.120 --> 59:26.900]  Yeah, this is a...
[59:28.160 --> 59:29.120]  This is a weird game.
[59:29.280 --> 59:29.340]  Ow!
[59:29.480 --> 59:30.280]  It's a lot of fun.
[59:30.560 --> 59:32.260]  Nick loves repeating...
[59:32.260 --> 59:36.000]  He loves a From Software game, so he loves just doing it over and over again.
[59:36.280 --> 59:38.740]  And this is classically what you're getting out of this.
[59:39.100 --> 59:40.000]  Don't talk to me about From.
[59:40.860 --> 59:41.220]  From?
[59:42.000 --> 59:42.800]  I'm calling From.
[59:42.880 --> 59:43.500]  I'm not gonna call...
[59:43.500 --> 59:44.820]  They don't get the benefit of From.
[59:45.240 --> 59:45.700]  There you go.
[59:45.820 --> 59:46.280]  There you go.
[59:46.360 --> 59:46.880]  You see it right.
[59:46.920 --> 59:47.560]  You see it right.
[59:47.680 --> 59:48.280]  You see it right.
[59:48.380 --> 59:48.980]  You see it right.
[59:49.300 --> 59:50.100]  I see it now.
[59:50.360 --> 59:51.240]  Nice, nice, nice.
[59:51.800 --> 59:53.040]  You can see how I was...
[59:53.040 --> 59:55.020]  When I was initially going past it, how I would miss it.
[59:55.100 --> 59:55.480]  I can't.
[59:56.200 --> 59:56.720]  I don't.
[59:57.160 --> 59:57.400]  No.
[59:57.600 --> 59:58.460]  I'm on your side, Nick.
[59:59.280 --> 59:59.640]  Andrew's right.
[59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.120]  Go for the jump!
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.520]  Guys, we're counting down.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.740]  We are but 45 seconds away from 5.01 PM on a Friday.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.060]  The best time of the week.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.120]  Thank you guys for joining us.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.660]  This has been a lot of fun.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.480]  Thank you, TriBand, for giving us the code for this game.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:27.060]  Geoff, any thoughts before we get into the 5.01 time?
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:32.080]  No, just that if you are an optometrist or you have one in your family,
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.960]  and you can help Nick out, I think it's critical at this point.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.280]  We need to get this looked into.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.900]  I'm gonna have to start paying extra attention to the videos he edits
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.200]  because God knows what he sees.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.080]  He's gonna miss some critical stuff.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.280]  Luckily, he's an audio guy.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.840]  And it is 5.01, guys.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.080]  It's quitting time, but we gotta go out on this hot level with Nick.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.560]  Thank you guys so much.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.980]  It's party time.
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.260]  It's quitting time.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.120]  We appreciate everyone going crazy mode in the chat.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.900]  Everyone who's watching the VOD on Tuesday.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.640]  Don't forget to join us on Friday.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.140]  Oh, look at that!
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:17.080]  5.01 PM, time to crack a prebiotic soda of your choice
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.520]  and ease on into the weekend.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:20.460]  Yeah, baby.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.840]  Yee-haw!
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.220]  He made it. He's going right off the edge.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.620]  What is he doing?
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.980]  He did it. He adjusted.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.620]  I adjusted.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:30.580]  Adjusted.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.840]  Not going back.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:32.460]  Come on.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:33.720]  Come on.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.960]  All the way in!
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:36.740]  Nice!
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.000]  Cut the feed!
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.460]  Guys, definitely check out What the Car when it comes out.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.240]  This game rocks. I'm gonna play it.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.040]  This is awesome.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.380]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.920]  Nick, any final thoughts?
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.200]  Oh, hit it.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.300]  Hit it.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:51.540]  Ow!
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.540]  Hit it and it'll take us out.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.160]  Oh, hit the button?
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.880]  Yeah, let's go hit it.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.380]  Here we go.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:56.740]  Ready?
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:57.340]  Ow.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:58.740]  Yay!
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.080]  And...
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.160]  That's the button to turn it off.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:01.600]  Bye-bye!
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.340]  Bye!
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.060]  Bye!
