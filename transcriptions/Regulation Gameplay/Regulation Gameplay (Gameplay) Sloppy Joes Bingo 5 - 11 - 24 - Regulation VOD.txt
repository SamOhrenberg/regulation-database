[00:00.000 --> 00:03.300]  So we have a great sloppy jizz bingo for you here tonight.
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.540]  Whoever wins, wins a cake.
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.340]  Very exciting stuff.
[00:08.420 --> 00:09.700]  We can actually buy the cakes now.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.720]  Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Mm hmm. Very exciting.
[00:12.900 --> 00:13.880]  So are you guys ready?
[00:13.980 --> 00:15.820]  Everyone's generated a card. You guys are all set.
[00:16.180 --> 00:18.500]  I am ready. I'm all set.
[00:18.520 --> 00:19.800]  What did you burn yourself on?
[00:19.860 --> 00:20.320]  What'd you do?
[00:20.580 --> 00:22.040]  I splashed tea on my legs.
[00:22.640 --> 00:24.780]  Oh, OK. Did you make an evening tea?
[00:25.460 --> 00:25.960]  Oh, I did.
[00:26.220 --> 00:27.620]  Oh, that's some British shit right there.
[00:27.900 --> 00:29.040]  Yeah. What kind of tea is it?
[00:29.040 --> 00:30.460]  Oh, great.
[00:31.160 --> 00:34.220]  Oh, OK. Hey, Nick, you should cover that in your in your podcast.
[00:34.360 --> 00:35.980]  I do. I just want to know.
[00:36.160 --> 00:39.420]  We were talking about it before we went live.
[00:39.820 --> 00:42.600]  I've been pushing really hard for Nick and Gavin to do a show together.
[00:42.780 --> 00:43.720]  I don't know what it is.
[00:43.840 --> 00:45.480]  Nobody knows what it is, but boy, I want it.
[00:45.580 --> 00:47.340]  I think that's a great pairing to me.
[00:49.620 --> 00:52.060]  All right. If we're ready to kick it off, guys,
[00:52.080 --> 00:54.440]  I think it's just about slop o'clock here.
[00:54.500 --> 00:55.000]  Are you guys ready?
[00:55.520 --> 00:56.360]  I'm ready. I'm ready.
[00:56.560 --> 00:58.280]  All right. I'm watching. Here we go.
[00:58.280 --> 01:03.800]  Here we go. Sloppy Joe's begins in three, two, one now.
[01:05.740 --> 01:07.540]  OK, let me look at my thing.
[01:07.700 --> 01:09.960]  Does anybody want to read off what they have or is that annoying?
[01:10.140 --> 01:11.100]  I feel like it's annoying.
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.900]  I think it's annoying for too many people.
[01:13.380 --> 01:14.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15.300 --> 01:16.260]  That guy's not a coward.
[01:16.780 --> 01:19.880]  How long has it been since we've played Sloppy Joe's Bingo?
[01:20.480 --> 01:21.340]  It's been a long time.
[01:21.480 --> 01:22.480]  Someone in the chat can let us know.
[01:22.540 --> 01:23.540]  It's been months and months.
[01:23.960 --> 01:26.200]  Yeah. And I haven't played it at home either.
[01:26.200 --> 01:27.680]  Oh, you've been doing it.
[01:27.740 --> 01:28.700]  You've been playing other stuff.
[01:28.900 --> 01:31.700]  Yeah, I've been playing a tie stripper triple.
[01:33.540 --> 01:35.580]  You can't. I don't know if you're allowed to say that.
[01:35.840 --> 01:38.700]  I imagine that will be behind the paywall if we ever do that.
[01:42.800 --> 01:43.920]  Oh, man. Oh, man.
[01:44.340 --> 01:45.860]  Anybody see a Meemaw yet?
[01:46.320 --> 01:48.380]  I don't know. You guys have any luxury cars yet?
[01:48.460 --> 01:50.020]  Are we going to have a big argument about luxury cars?
[01:50.020 --> 01:51.840]  Oh, wait, do I have a luxury car thing?
[01:52.120 --> 01:53.440]  That Hyundai is not a luxury car.
[01:53.540 --> 01:55.340]  I do. Shit. God damn it.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.280]  Uh, I, uh, it's the beginning of these are always you have way too many things.
[02:01.400 --> 02:02.540]  You try to process a lot.
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.940]  So hard to accept that you're going to miss bouncer stuff that you're so screwed.
[02:07.840 --> 02:11.980]  I wish this bingo website, the bingo card website had a dark mode
[02:11.980 --> 02:15.140]  because it is bright. It's very bright on my brain.
[02:15.520 --> 02:17.600]  Well, I guess we'll just have to work with Goovicon
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.660]  to make a dark mode version and like actually have it.
[02:21.920 --> 02:23.140]  Oh, those guys are holding hands.
[02:23.240 --> 02:24.820]  Does anybody have holding hands? Yeah, I do.
[02:24.820 --> 02:27.620]  And those to me, that was crosswalk cowards.
[02:27.680 --> 02:28.500]  But I'm not going to call it.
[02:28.580 --> 02:31.660]  It'll be no, I don't think I didn't hands as a category. Yeah.
[02:32.700 --> 02:35.460]  Oh, wow. This is the worst I've ever had.
[02:35.620 --> 02:37.600]  Oh, those kids are way too late.
[02:37.740 --> 02:40.660]  You got about 24 minutes to get those little fuckers home.
[02:41.100 --> 02:42.460]  Yeah. No, man, it's nine.
[02:42.580 --> 02:43.320]  Those kids should be in bed.
[02:45.040 --> 02:47.000]  Oh, there's a dog in a golf cart.
[02:47.060 --> 02:49.300]  Dog in a golf cart. That should be a new category.
[02:49.520 --> 02:52.820]  I have go car, but car is spelt with a C, which is strange.
[02:53.320 --> 02:54.200]  Oh, that guy.
[02:55.320 --> 02:56.700]  He could have been a dead parrot head.
[02:58.260 --> 02:59.500]  Anybody see a cop car?
[03:00.460 --> 03:01.200]  Not yet. Not yet.
[03:01.440 --> 03:02.400]  I've been here 30 minutes ago.
[03:02.860 --> 03:03.920]  I don't have anything yet.
[03:04.320 --> 03:07.880]  I feel like they had a security guy change over and I don't know all the new dudes yet.
[03:08.780 --> 03:10.300]  You haven't been keeping up.
[03:10.460 --> 03:11.860]  I know. I know. I got to get back into it.
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.080]  I have American flag clothes and I also have offensive shirt.
[03:17.560 --> 03:18.860]  Could that be a double pair?
[03:19.140 --> 03:20.620]  Could be. It depends.
[03:20.620 --> 03:23.300]  It depends on what the American flag clothes are.
[03:23.300 --> 03:28.100]  Well, can you technically argue that any American flag item of clothing is offensive?
[03:29.880 --> 03:30.680]  To the flag?
[03:30.700 --> 03:31.520]  Is that technically?
[03:33.300 --> 03:35.900]  I feel like Geoff, you can argue that we won't accept it.
[03:35.900 --> 03:36.720]  Is that a stupid hat?
[03:37.040 --> 03:39.000]  Man, it's not supposed to be on.
[03:39.380 --> 03:42.000]  You're not supposed to print it on on clothing.
[03:42.260 --> 03:43.720]  It's disrespectful to the flag.
[03:43.980 --> 03:45.820]  There we go. We're good. We're good. You're good.
[03:46.060 --> 03:48.220]  But it doesn't seem to fucking matter anymore. So no.
[03:49.340 --> 03:50.960]  So put those sunglasses on, dude.
[03:51.040 --> 03:53.900]  Put those sunglasses on. Come on, old man.
[03:53.960 --> 03:55.460]  Oh, there's a cast. Anybody got a cast?
[03:55.960 --> 03:57.440]  I've got. Wait, where is it?
[03:57.860 --> 03:59.940]  No, I have a bandage, dude.
[04:00.080 --> 04:01.980]  Yeah, bandage, dude. But that's different.
[04:03.100 --> 04:06.020]  Bandage, dude, I think works for a cast.
[04:06.340 --> 04:08.200]  I'll take it. Does it? I'll take it.
[04:08.400 --> 04:09.920]  And yeah, if you want to give it, I'll take it.
[04:09.980 --> 04:12.500]  Yeah, if you give, I take. I don't take bandage, dude.
[04:12.600 --> 04:15.700]  I mean, a cast is just a serious bandage.
[04:15.700 --> 04:18.120]  Yeah, that's true. It doesn't get much more serious.
[04:18.320 --> 04:20.460]  A hard bandage. Yeah. Mm hmm.
[04:21.740 --> 04:23.060]  A lot of people in the road right now.
[04:23.240 --> 04:24.680]  It's a bandage that they left in the freezer.
[04:24.880 --> 04:27.040]  That guy's huffing it. The freezer?
[04:27.340 --> 04:29.260]  Who? That dude across the street.
[04:30.440 --> 04:33.540]  Mm hmm. You can mark it if you feel like you really huff.
[04:33.660 --> 04:35.040]  Like like if there was some huffing. No, I didn't see it.
[04:35.700 --> 04:37.540]  I didn't either. He was just jogging.
[04:38.940 --> 04:41.420]  It's sort of a tough thing with huffing it because you can maybe argue
[04:41.420 --> 04:43.800]  he was huffing it so hard we all missed it.
[04:43.860 --> 04:45.180]  And that is definitely huffing it.
[04:45.180 --> 04:46.640]  Oh, are we going to FaceTime him?
[04:46.760 --> 04:48.180]  We might get acknowledge the camera here.
[04:48.440 --> 04:51.100]  Selfie. Definitely. She's acknowledging the camera right now.
[04:51.420 --> 04:52.840]  Get a selfie. No, no.
[04:52.840 --> 04:53.940]  They're just bringing up the website.
[04:54.240 --> 04:55.080]  Put your sunglasses on.
[04:57.120 --> 05:01.080]  Do you think he's bringing up the Sloppy Joe's feed or the regulation pod Twitch?
[05:03.340 --> 05:05.000]  Uh oh. Oh, there they go.
[05:05.240 --> 05:07.500]  Nick, you have to hit the button.
[05:07.700 --> 05:08.280]  Refresh it.
[05:08.660 --> 05:11.640]  Nick, hit the fucking button. The wheelchair is going by right now.
[05:12.200 --> 05:14.700]  There's a beach goth in a wheelchair and they're a dead parrot head.
[05:14.700 --> 05:15.220]  Come on.
[05:17.480 --> 05:20.800]  For quality purposes, that's running on a laptop into a computer.
[05:24.360 --> 05:25.560]  Through a capture card.
[05:26.560 --> 05:28.060]  Yawning twerking barefoot.
[05:29.040 --> 05:29.400]  Let's look.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.480]  Oh, she put on the sunglasses.
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.740]  I don't have anything yet.
[05:34.860 --> 05:36.540]  I don't know. I have zero things.
[05:36.820 --> 05:37.620]  Yeah, it's a tough one.
[05:38.520 --> 05:40.440]  We could be here a long time.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.900]  Well, yeah, but Fisher's not running it, so he's not held hostage for four
[05:43.900 --> 05:45.400]  and a half hours. Yeah, that's true.
[05:46.140 --> 05:47.760]  We're not ruining anybody else's night.
[05:47.960 --> 05:49.940]  Oh, your kid is almost out too late, buddy.
[05:50.180 --> 05:51.840]  Acknowledging the camera, the camera.
[05:52.160 --> 05:53.760]  That's a way back, guys.
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.300]  Oh, that definitely counts.
[05:55.940 --> 05:58.280]  The peace sign. That's not one stupid hat.
[05:58.560 --> 05:59.380]  That's a stupid hat.
[05:59.400 --> 06:01.180]  If I've ever seen one on that dude. Yeah, that is.
[06:01.300 --> 06:02.120]  Yeah. Oh, my God.
[06:02.720 --> 06:03.660]  Oh, I've got mullet.
[06:03.700 --> 06:05.120]  I haven't even been looking for mullets.
[06:05.280 --> 06:06.220]  Shit. Come on.
[06:06.280 --> 06:08.520]  Yeah, I don't have stupid hat.
[06:08.600 --> 06:09.500]  I don't have stupid hat.
[06:10.140 --> 06:12.220]  I do. This is the worst list of it.
[06:12.220 --> 06:14.500]  I got to look for jeans and flip flops.
[06:14.700 --> 06:16.040]  Yeah, that's going to be a tough one.
[06:16.600 --> 06:18.500]  I feel like be one that comes out of nowhere.
[06:18.700 --> 06:20.840]  I think that one might be your best bet, though.
[06:21.360 --> 06:22.420]  Jeans and flip flops?
[06:22.640 --> 06:24.000]  Dude, the flip flops are out tonight.
[06:24.560 --> 06:26.220]  Have they got any trash cans across the street?
[06:27.460 --> 06:27.760]  What? Yeah.
[06:29.320 --> 06:31.040]  Those. Are you saying are they different?
[06:31.600 --> 06:33.120]  Like, yeah, was that recycling that before?
[06:34.020 --> 06:37.580]  There were two there before, but those look nicer than I remember.
[06:37.580 --> 06:39.320]  They look nicer, don't they? Yeah, they do.
[06:40.100 --> 06:41.540]  There's no bikes locked up to them.
[06:41.540 --> 06:43.780]  Maybe Key West is upgrading.
[06:47.400 --> 06:48.340]  Drop it, drop it.
[06:48.820 --> 06:49.720]  Yeah, come on, bud.
[06:50.400 --> 06:52.080]  Crosswalk coward. Crosswalk coward over there.
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.480]  I saw that, too. I saw that, too.
[06:53.580 --> 06:56.040]  Hundred percent. You fucking coward.
[06:57.260 --> 06:58.740]  I don't. God damn it.
[06:59.100 --> 07:00.600]  That dude on the scooter is wearing sunglasses.
[07:01.360 --> 07:01.960]  Where? You're right.
[07:02.120 --> 07:03.840]  Oh, the top. The lady is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:04.300 --> 07:05.020]  Sunglasses at night.
[07:05.340 --> 07:07.660]  I don't. I think it's the first time I don't have that one.
[07:07.780 --> 07:08.740]  Oh, two in a row.
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.040]  I count on that one.
[07:10.920 --> 07:13.560]  Wow, that's a luxury golf cart.
[07:13.780 --> 07:15.820]  No, it's not. What are you talking about?
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.620]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[07:18.540 --> 07:21.540]  Oh, oh, I mean, it's a matching outfit.
[07:21.720 --> 07:22.180]  I got that.
[07:22.600 --> 07:24.360]  Damn it. Is that formal attire?
[07:26.080 --> 07:27.220]  Where is this?
[07:27.920 --> 07:28.940]  Look at that.
[07:29.360 --> 07:31.760]  You think that hats aren't formal attire?
[07:31.900 --> 07:33.320]  Listen, I'm trying to four six.
[07:34.080 --> 07:35.580]  I'm sorry. That was.
[07:35.840 --> 07:36.660]  I know I'm forcing.
[07:36.880 --> 07:38.840]  That guy's that guy's shorts are below the knees.
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.760]  Do they count his pants with his flip flops?
[07:40.920 --> 07:42.220]  No, don't ask.
[07:42.320 --> 07:43.720]  Don't Andrew this thing.
[07:43.900 --> 07:45.460]  Look, another acknowledge the camera.
[07:45.620 --> 07:47.700]  She has flip flops and jean shorts.
[07:48.120 --> 07:49.840]  No, those are jeans.
[07:50.880 --> 07:52.320]  Grow up. All right.
[07:52.900 --> 07:54.360]  Wow, they are staring.
[07:55.280 --> 07:56.780]  That's a fucking guy right there.
[07:56.900 --> 07:57.500]  Look at that mustache.
[07:58.340 --> 07:59.380]  Hell fucking yeah, brother.
[07:59.660 --> 08:00.900]  Regulation listeners right there.
[08:01.140 --> 08:02.180]  We'll see you Wednesday, buddy.
[08:02.600 --> 08:05.020]  That's a great handlebar on that face.
[08:05.140 --> 08:05.320]  Yep.
[08:06.020 --> 08:06.740]  What? What?
[08:06.860 --> 08:08.260]  What does her shirt say?
[08:08.260 --> 08:11.620]  I'm trying to figure out if it's a shenanigans begin.
[08:12.300 --> 08:12.740]  Yeah, OK.
[08:12.960 --> 08:14.180]  Now it's just a Zayn shirt.
[08:14.420 --> 08:14.780]  Out too late.
[08:14.980 --> 08:16.140]  Definitely kid out too late.
[08:16.960 --> 08:17.560]  Oh, look at that.
[08:17.840 --> 08:19.240]  That's a thick beard.
[08:19.580 --> 08:20.400]  Oh, they still got 20.
[08:20.600 --> 08:22.460]  They still got 20 minutes before it's too late.
[08:22.580 --> 08:26.800]  So you're saying kid out too late doesn't count until 930?
[08:27.120 --> 08:28.060]  I'm not a fan of this Geoff.
[08:28.300 --> 08:30.160]  Historically, it's always been 930.
[08:30.320 --> 08:31.340]  I have it. I respect it.
[08:31.700 --> 08:32.460]  I respect it.
[08:32.480 --> 08:33.040]  No, I have it.
[08:33.140 --> 08:34.820]  Not then they can't be out.
[08:34.980 --> 08:35.980]  Then then it doesn't count.
[08:36.320 --> 08:37.820]  I felt like you had a bit going
[08:37.820 --> 08:40.680]  before, Geoff, where no matter the time, the kid was out too late.
[08:40.820 --> 08:41.500]  And I miss that.
[08:41.800 --> 08:44.220]  No, no, no, I didn't.
[08:44.300 --> 08:45.380]  Formal attire?
[08:45.380 --> 08:46.040]  I'm pretty consistent.
[08:46.260 --> 08:47.060]  No. Where?
[08:47.500 --> 08:48.240]  In the orange?
[08:48.260 --> 08:48.880]  I had no way.
[08:49.040 --> 08:50.000]  I'm just I'm just seeing.
[08:50.180 --> 08:50.940]  I'm just asking. Summer dress?
[08:52.700 --> 08:53.360]  Hey, that guy waited.
[08:53.720 --> 08:54.300]  Did that guy yell?
[08:54.480 --> 08:55.300]  No, I think he was saying goodbye.
[08:55.780 --> 08:55.980]  Yeah.
[08:56.680 --> 08:57.500]  Need to wait up.
[08:58.360 --> 09:00.040]  Is that jeans and sandals across the way?
[09:00.100 --> 09:01.240]  The woman? Ah, she's walking away.
[09:01.480 --> 09:02.320]  God damn it. Hard to tell.
[09:03.220 --> 09:03.520]  Fuck.
[09:03.820 --> 09:04.880]  Sorry, man. Couldn't see.
[09:05.780 --> 09:06.300]  Jeans, jeans.
[09:06.440 --> 09:07.700]  No, those are capris.
[09:07.840 --> 09:08.340]  Do they count?
[09:09.440 --> 09:09.600]  Why?
[09:09.800 --> 09:11.880]  Woman in the blue walking away at the. God damn it.
[09:14.380 --> 09:15.260]  Oh, I'm not.
[09:15.380 --> 09:17.720]  It's not definitive enough for me to count it.
[09:18.220 --> 09:20.000]  Heartbreaking. Slurping on a straw.
[09:20.160 --> 09:20.940]  That's what was that bus?
[09:21.780 --> 09:22.420]  I'm sorry.
[09:22.580 --> 09:23.540]  Oh, I didn't see it.
[09:23.560 --> 09:24.560]  Fuck. Was that the fuck?
[09:24.640 --> 09:26.960]  Was it a ghost tour to the white school bus?
[09:27.100 --> 09:28.140]  I don't know if it was.
[09:28.480 --> 09:29.500]  I don't know. Damn it.
[09:29.540 --> 09:30.720]  I need to go to school as well.
[09:30.780 --> 09:31.640]  Or street train.
[09:32.120 --> 09:32.720]  That's sick.
[09:33.820 --> 09:34.940]  Oh, guy in a scooter.
[09:35.040 --> 09:35.780]  Is that a three wheel?
[09:35.980 --> 09:37.680]  Oh, that's jeans and flip flops in front of us.
[09:37.740 --> 09:38.780]  Let the shenanigans begin.
[09:39.080 --> 09:39.120]  Oh shit.
[09:39.460 --> 09:40.640]  Oh, wow. Jesus Christ.
[09:41.180 --> 09:41.820]  Is this a trike?
[09:42.480 --> 09:44.120]  Is that a trike on the left?
[09:44.180 --> 09:45.160]  Yes. Yeah, that's a trike.
[09:45.420 --> 09:46.660]  Oh my God, we're hitting, we're hitting.
[09:48.800 --> 09:49.440]  Our ambulance.
[09:49.640 --> 09:51.400]  Oh, there's so many possibilities.
[09:51.780 --> 09:52.660]  So many possibilities.
[09:53.420 --> 09:54.840]  Somebody sit on the street, please.
[09:55.120 --> 09:55.940]  Somebody roll on.
[09:56.480 --> 09:57.080]  Oh, that holding hands.
[09:57.960 --> 09:59.220]  We yeah, we definitely got holding hands.
[09:59.980 --> 10:00.800]  Oh, I don't need that.
[10:00.820 --> 10:01.380]  I need handshake.
[10:01.380 --> 10:02.320]  I'm getting mixed up.
[10:03.520 --> 10:04.560]  What about karate chop?
[10:05.320 --> 10:05.980]  That man.
[10:07.540 --> 10:08.960]  Or high fiving a ghost?
[10:11.060 --> 10:14.560]  That little plastic bag looks like it could be a purse or a bag of dog shit.
[10:14.640 --> 10:15.140]  I can't tell you.
[10:17.280 --> 10:20.220]  I, it was, I never found out.
[10:22.560 --> 10:24.320]  These people are just fucking chilling, huh?
[10:24.620 --> 10:25.320]  Is she a meemaw?
[10:26.100 --> 10:27.260]  No, no, no.
[10:27.420 --> 10:29.180]  It's close. It's close.
[10:29.380 --> 10:30.580]  No, no, it's not.
[10:30.580 --> 10:31.680]  She's far too mobile.
[10:31.840 --> 10:32.660]  Her mom's a meemaw.
[10:33.560 --> 10:34.440]  Yeah. Oh, OK.
[10:35.200 --> 10:38.060]  That lady is acknowledging the camera over there in the bottom left.
[10:38.220 --> 10:38.620]  She was.
[10:40.320 --> 10:41.380]  She's watching the regulation.
[10:42.460 --> 10:42.940]  Twitch right now.
[10:42.980 --> 10:46.140]  Remember when we had the whole blow up about like, oh, pink taxis are gone.
[10:46.260 --> 10:47.020]  There aren't any pink taxis.
[10:47.080 --> 10:48.920]  And then we went to the U.S. and we saw pink taxis everywhere.
[10:49.280 --> 10:50.740]  Yeah, that was.
[10:50.880 --> 10:51.460]  Where are they now?
[10:52.820 --> 10:53.660]  I can't tell.
[10:54.980 --> 10:56.280]  They'll be the man with the hat.
[10:57.600 --> 10:59.760]  He's got like an Elmer Fudd thing going on,
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.440]  and I can't tell if that's the hat's design or if he's just wearing it that way.
[11:04.640 --> 11:07.700]  Like the way that it's indented.
[11:08.420 --> 11:10.060]  It is a little bit of an Elmer Fudd thing.
[11:10.080 --> 11:13.240]  I'm trying to figure out if he's done that or if that's just how the hat is.
[11:13.680 --> 11:14.980]  Yep. That's awesome.
[11:14.980 --> 11:15.740]  That's a cool dog.
[11:15.840 --> 11:16.260]  There's a dog.
[11:17.460 --> 11:18.720]  We should have a cool dog.
[11:18.980 --> 11:20.160]  Do we do have dogs, don't we?
[11:20.300 --> 11:22.180]  We do. I don't think we do.
[11:22.180 --> 11:23.520]  Chilly Dog is on here, but that's it.
[11:23.540 --> 11:24.300]  I can't remember if we do.
[11:24.880 --> 11:26.180]  I think it's a handshake.
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.880]  I definitely need a handshake.
[11:31.400 --> 11:35.140]  A nose pick or a crotch grab or a wedgie pull or a spin.
[11:35.140 --> 11:41.420]  I could use a hug on this and more, but a hug is definitely on my list.
[11:41.520 --> 11:42.980]  Do you need us to meet you somewhere?
[11:43.580 --> 11:43.920]  Are you OK?
[11:45.440 --> 11:46.560]  One of those days, huh?
[11:46.900 --> 11:49.460]  Eric, who have you hugged from our company?
[11:50.620 --> 11:53.320]  I've hugged a lot of people in the last three weeks.
[11:53.480 --> 11:54.420]  No, our company.
[11:55.520 --> 11:55.840]  Oh.
[11:56.560 --> 11:57.740]  Have I hugged you?
[11:58.400 --> 11:58.560]  No.
[11:59.480 --> 12:00.580]  That was definitive.
[12:00.820 --> 12:02.700]  You need to stop and think about that.
[12:02.860 --> 12:03.680]  I think we've hugged Eric.
[12:04.280 --> 12:05.840]  I feel like I've hugged Nick.
[12:07.160 --> 12:08.440]  I feel like I've hugged Geoff.
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.800]  Have we?
[12:10.500 --> 12:11.320]  It feels like it.
[12:11.520 --> 12:11.960]  This man...
[12:11.960 --> 12:13.160]  Oh, scooter!
[12:13.340 --> 12:13.780]  Wheelchair!
[12:14.020 --> 12:14.520]  Scooter thing!
[12:14.760 --> 12:15.360]  Is that a wheelchair?
[12:15.440 --> 12:16.100]  That's a wheelchair!
[12:16.420 --> 12:18.280]  Oh my God, Andrew.
[12:18.460 --> 12:19.500]  That counts, dude!
[12:19.680 --> 12:20.040]  Andrew.
[12:20.040 --> 12:21.280]  Yeah, that definitely counts.
[12:21.620 --> 12:22.440]  Andrew, it happens.
[12:23.040 --> 12:25.820]  That dude rolled right up in front of you, man.
[12:25.820 --> 12:26.980]  That's so awesome.
[12:27.300 --> 12:28.400]  I would have missed it, too.
[12:28.940 --> 12:29.460]  Oh, dude, look.
[12:29.680 --> 12:31.860]  Matching fanny packs back there on the other side of the street.
[12:31.960 --> 12:32.300]  Wow.
[12:33.940 --> 12:34.800]  Oh, they don't really fanny.
[12:34.900 --> 12:35.940]  They're more shouldery, aren't they?
[12:36.600 --> 12:39.160]  That lady in the blue shirt wants to be a Meemaw so bad.
[12:39.340 --> 12:40.360]  Oh, she's so close, too.
[12:40.560 --> 12:40.800]  Yep.
[12:41.640 --> 12:42.420]  She's on the cusp.
[12:43.520 --> 12:43.700]  All right.
[12:43.880 --> 12:45.000]  Someone shake hands.
[12:45.060 --> 12:45.740]  Look at all these hands.
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.200]  I have set the narrative that Elmer Fluthat is looking for a wascally wabbit, and he's
[12:52.200 --> 12:53.300]  just on the prowl.
[12:53.540 --> 12:55.220]  And it is bringing me so much joy.
[12:56.100 --> 12:57.060]  You find your...
[12:57.420 --> 12:59.060]  Somebody's looking for a mullet recently, right?
[12:59.500 --> 12:59.700]  Yeah.
[12:59.800 --> 13:01.480]  Oh, is that mullet there in the hat across the street?
[13:01.800 --> 13:02.140]  I don't think so.
[13:02.140 --> 13:04.080]  No, that's just long hair and a hat.
[13:04.520 --> 13:05.660]  But I was looking for you.
[13:06.160 --> 13:06.420]  Yeah.
[13:07.580 --> 13:08.840]  Anybody sat on the street yet?
[13:09.540 --> 13:10.980]  No, I've been looking for that one also.
[13:11.160 --> 13:13.580]  I also need a beach goth, but I don't know, man.
[13:13.600 --> 13:15.260]  Oh, man, I desperately need a beach goth.
[13:15.500 --> 13:16.200]  Beach goth?
[13:16.440 --> 13:16.900]  Does it...
[13:16.900 --> 13:20.100]  Like, that guy's like the closest we've gotten so far, and it's just because he has a skull
[13:20.100 --> 13:20.840]  tattoo on his leg.
[13:20.920 --> 13:21.160]  Yeah.
[13:25.700 --> 13:27.820]  Somebody yell for somebody else to wait up, please.
[13:27.880 --> 13:28.420]  That was a nice car.
[13:28.520 --> 13:29.000]  Yeah, really.
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.480]  Somebody handshake or high five.
[13:31.560 --> 13:32.560]  I just need hands to hit.
[13:33.040 --> 13:34.500]  That's a high end telluride.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.720]  The hard part about where we're positioned here...
[13:37.720 --> 13:38.180]  Fire truck!
[13:38.320 --> 13:38.720]  That counts!
[13:39.540 --> 13:40.580]  Is fire truck on the...
[13:40.580 --> 13:42.680]  Yeah, cop car, ambulance, fire truck is one.
[13:42.920 --> 13:43.280]  Oh, okay.
[13:43.720 --> 13:44.140]  The hard part...
[13:44.140 --> 13:45.920]  Whenever you say fire truck, that counts.
[13:46.220 --> 13:47.000]  Like, it counts.
[13:47.000 --> 13:47.520]  It counts.
[13:48.120 --> 13:49.120]  I get excited.
[13:49.680 --> 13:50.160]  So...
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.060]  I get very excited.
[13:51.060 --> 13:57.320]  The hard part about where this is positioned with the camera is just off to the left is
[13:57.320 --> 13:59.660]  a taxi pick up and drop off point.
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.040]  Ah.
[14:00.520 --> 14:00.700]  But...
[14:01.680 --> 14:02.120]  But...
[14:02.120 --> 14:02.660]  It is like...
[14:02.660 --> 14:02.860]  Hug.
[14:02.920 --> 14:03.980]  Right there.
[14:04.200 --> 14:05.300]  And it is long.
[14:05.440 --> 14:06.680]  Like, the line is long.
[14:07.020 --> 14:11.900]  And it's never quite long enough to show us someone who's getting picked up or dropped
[14:11.900 --> 14:12.140]  off.
[14:12.240 --> 14:12.880]  It's a killer.
[14:13.180 --> 14:13.740]  It sucks.
[14:14.100 --> 14:15.540]  So it's just outside the window of possibility.
[14:15.540 --> 14:16.960]  See where the taxi's pulling in right there?
[14:17.000 --> 14:17.160]  Yeah.
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.020]  That is...
[14:18.020 --> 14:19.080]  That's the spot.
[14:21.060 --> 14:21.140]  Is that a luxury car, Geoff?
[14:21.140 --> 14:22.780]  Hey, that guy's got a Jason Mraz hat.
[14:23.180 --> 14:24.120]  Geoff, is that a luxury car?
[14:25.400 --> 14:25.800]  Yes.
[14:25.960 --> 14:26.380]  Yeah, alright.
[14:26.460 --> 14:27.540]  Holy shit, really?
[14:27.620 --> 14:28.440]  Yes, I think it is.
[14:29.080 --> 14:29.380]  Take it.
[14:29.920 --> 14:30.920]  I wasn't even gonna ask.
[14:30.980 --> 14:33.200]  Also, got a wheelchair over there on the other side.
[14:33.800 --> 14:33.920]  Nice.
[14:33.920 --> 14:34.540]  What, for real?
[14:34.820 --> 14:35.340]  Oh my god.
[14:36.320 --> 14:37.140]  Scootin' up there, bud.
[14:37.280 --> 14:38.320]  That's a more classic wheelchair.
[14:38.660 --> 14:38.860]  Yeah.
[14:38.860 --> 14:39.460]  Yeah, definitely.
[14:39.740 --> 14:40.420]  Wheelchair classic.
[14:40.780 --> 14:42.040]  You get lots of eras.
[14:42.080 --> 14:43.560]  That lady's got sunglasses on at night, too.
[14:43.680 --> 14:44.000]  Boom.
[14:44.480 --> 14:44.680]  Yeah.
[14:45.080 --> 14:45.640]  Is she a Meemaw?
[14:46.400 --> 14:46.720]  Uh...
[14:46.720 --> 14:47.080]  No.
[14:47.420 --> 14:47.640]  No.
[14:48.060 --> 14:49.640]  No, she's just wearing cool sunglasses.
[14:49.640 --> 14:50.260]  Whoa.
[14:50.320 --> 14:50.740]  You know what?
[14:50.940 --> 14:52.560]  With us doing this for the first time here,
[14:52.660 --> 14:54.940]  I've done this a few times by myself, just showing the feed.
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.920]  One of the best parts of this is we get Twitch clips.
[14:58.400 --> 14:59.600]  So people will be clippin' stuff.
[14:59.740 --> 15:02.240]  It's great to be able to go back and see what you missed.
[15:02.560 --> 15:03.420]  Oh, that's cool.
[15:03.740 --> 15:05.400]  That is an advantage we will have.
[15:05.660 --> 15:06.920]  That's gonna be really frustrating, probably.
[15:07.940 --> 15:09.200]  All the shit we missed.
[15:09.820 --> 15:11.480]  Guys, how come they didn't see this?
[15:11.820 --> 15:13.340]  That kid has 12 minutes to get to bed.
[15:15.360 --> 15:17.000]  Oh, he disappeared behind a truck.
[15:17.300 --> 15:18.320]  Look at that guy's stash.
[15:18.360 --> 15:19.620]  Oh, he did the Jason board trick.
[15:19.620 --> 15:20.260]  Is that FaceTime?
[15:20.300 --> 15:21.000]  That's FaceTime!
[15:22.700 --> 15:23.060]  FaceTime!
[15:23.140 --> 15:25.140]  Is FaceTime selfie or is that different?
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.680]  Can't see FaceTime screen is what I just checked.
[15:29.120 --> 15:30.840]  Can't see FaceTime screen is different than selfie.
[15:32.100 --> 15:32.460]  Goddammit.
[15:32.600 --> 15:36.380]  I'm gonna call that bar and make that bouncer take a fuckin' selfie.
[15:36.700 --> 15:38.000]  Have we had formal attire yet or no?
[15:38.360 --> 15:38.720]  No.
[15:38.860 --> 15:39.240]  God, no.
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.920]  I've been looking so hard for it, Gavin.
[15:41.140 --> 15:42.220]  Have we had barefoot yet?
[15:42.400 --> 15:42.720]  Not yet.
[15:43.620 --> 15:45.420]  I've been looking, I haven't seen it.
[15:45.480 --> 15:47.240]  Nick's been fuckin' zeroed in on all the feet,
[15:47.320 --> 15:48.120]  so he would've called it out.
[15:48.120 --> 15:50.240]  Do you think it's interesting that it's Nick?
[15:50.240 --> 15:51.960]  Hold on, hold on now, that's not true.
[15:53.300 --> 15:53.740]  I'm not, I'm not.
[15:54.500 --> 15:55.300]  She's hammered.
[15:55.360 --> 15:55.880]  I'm not a foot guy.
[15:56.260 --> 15:56.420]  He's fuckin' hammered.
[15:56.980 --> 15:59.880]  I feel like with this new podcast, there's been switches in the roles.
[16:00.100 --> 16:02.860]  Like, we've got new foot guy, new piss guy.
[16:03.520 --> 16:05.080]  Yeah, we definitely have new piss guy.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.240]  Listen, I just know what people don't like about feet, okay?
[16:09.980 --> 16:14.840]  And he'll tell you in detail about all the things people like or don't like about feet.
[16:14.900 --> 16:15.240]  No, he won't.
[16:15.260 --> 16:16.660]  You won't have to ask.
[16:17.820 --> 16:20.040]  He's got a presentation, he'll give it to you.
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.180]  He just keeps, you're trapped in a car with him, he just keeps fuckin' sayin' it.
[16:23.240 --> 16:24.060]  He's got slides.
[16:24.060 --> 16:25.700]  He's got a few piss rats in the chat.
[16:26.240 --> 16:27.140]  Shout out to the piss rats.
[16:27.460 --> 16:28.480]  Shout out to the piss rats.
[16:29.300 --> 16:30.440]  Yeah, shout out to the pits rats.
[16:32.200 --> 16:32.840]  Pits rats?
[16:33.340 --> 16:33.840]  Pits rats?
[16:34.700 --> 16:36.320]  Okay, I don't know what to say about those two.
[16:36.340 --> 16:37.140]  Holy shit!
[16:37.240 --> 16:37.760]  Oh my god.
[16:37.780 --> 16:38.580]  That's a good old boy.
[16:38.940 --> 16:39.680]  Yosemite Sam?
[16:41.240 --> 16:42.140]  He's lookin' for Elmer.
[16:42.140 --> 16:43.200]  He's lookin' for Elmer Fudd.
[16:43.540 --> 16:44.700]  He's got a score to settle.
[16:45.760 --> 16:48.780]  Any of these bundle of people touchin' hands back there?
[16:48.940 --> 16:50.000]  No, I haven't seen any.
[16:50.000 --> 16:50.720]  Doesn't look like it.
[16:54.110 --> 16:56.110]  I need to separate it at the crosswalk so bad.
[16:56.370 --> 16:56.410]  Me too.
[16:56.490 --> 16:58.070]  Oh, they're huggin', they're huggin' up in the back.
[16:58.210 --> 16:58.970]  Yeah, he's got his...
[16:58.970 --> 17:00.050]  Rubbin' her back, rubbin' her back.
[17:00.210 --> 17:00.750]  Eww, bug.
[17:01.250 --> 17:02.590]  Is there any more in the middle there?
[17:02.650 --> 17:03.970]  I do have a hug, that counts.
[17:04.890 --> 17:05.090]  Where?
[17:05.250 --> 17:06.450]  Oh, that could be...
[17:06.450 --> 17:08.590]  Oh, oh, oh, look it, right there at the hug.
[17:08.730 --> 17:09.110]  Oh, that's a meme.
[17:09.110 --> 17:10.150]  I can't tell, we got...
[17:10.150 --> 17:10.930]  Oh, yeah.
[17:13.410 --> 17:16.150]  Dude, we have to get a closer look, you can't just call that.
[17:16.150 --> 17:21.250]  She's got Meemaw hair and Meemaw posture and a Meemaw jacket, but we need to see her face.
[17:21.350 --> 17:22.990]  We need Meemaw confirmation.
[17:23.950 --> 17:24.610]  It's like 80%...
[17:24.610 --> 17:25.410]  Might be a little old man.
[17:25.710 --> 17:27.150]  We need Meemaw-formation.
[17:27.590 --> 17:28.930]  We need a paw-paw, then.
[17:30.470 --> 17:31.150]  Oh, someone tripped.
[17:31.150 --> 17:33.410]  That guy just chugged somethin', if you need a chug.
[17:33.490 --> 17:33.870]  Tatum!
[17:34.210 --> 17:34.750]  Jason Tatum.
[17:35.530 --> 17:37.250]  He should be watchin' the fuckin' game, dude.
[17:37.750 --> 17:39.010]  He might be lookin' for a spot.
[17:39.150 --> 17:40.530]  Yeah, watch it for me, buddy.
[17:41.110 --> 17:42.230]  Yeah, are you recording the game?
[17:42.250 --> 17:42.650]  Hey!
[17:43.470 --> 17:44.390]  What's up, guy?
[17:45.110 --> 17:48.090]  Dude, all these bros and no handshakes, what's goin' on?
[17:49.250 --> 17:51.590]  I know, not a single high-five to be found.
[17:52.710 --> 17:54.930]  I need a pink taxi and a ghost tour bus.
[17:55.910 --> 17:57.570]  Are we gonna get a crosswalk separation?
[17:57.870 --> 17:58.070]  Nah.
[18:00.770 --> 18:02.030]  I need a twerk.
[18:02.870 --> 18:03.550]  Yeah, me too.
[18:04.550 --> 18:05.030]  I've given up on that.
[18:05.030 --> 18:08.450]  Twerks usually, twerks tough, they usually don't come out till after the kids go to bed.
[18:08.770 --> 18:09.010]  Damn.
[18:09.790 --> 18:11.590]  Well, that's not for another nine minutes, yeah.
[18:13.270 --> 18:14.570]  Has anyone got a shiny head?
[18:16.150 --> 18:17.770]  That guy's chuggin' it.
[18:18.050 --> 18:19.250]  And, where's the double fist?
[18:19.350 --> 18:21.030]  He might, does anybody have a...
[18:21.030 --> 18:21.650]  Is there a double fister?
[18:22.110 --> 18:23.210]  Does anybody have double fists?
[18:23.270 --> 18:23.550]  I do.
[18:24.550 --> 18:26.930]  He might, the guy in the blue, I can't see his left hand.
[18:27.110 --> 18:27.650]  No, it's not.
[18:27.650 --> 18:28.790]  No, I think it's like a hamburger.
[18:28.990 --> 18:29.890]  It's a dog, I think.
[18:30.070 --> 18:31.250]  You think that guy's wearing blue?
[18:31.270 --> 18:31.910]  Oh, is that a chili dog?
[18:31.910 --> 18:32.410]  Oh, I can't tell.
[18:32.410 --> 18:32.850]  Oh, kiss!
[18:33.750 --> 18:34.510]  Ooh, there's a kiss.
[18:34.610 --> 18:35.690]  I'm sorry, the cup was blue.
[18:35.990 --> 18:36.790]  Suckin' on a face.
[18:37.710 --> 18:38.070]  Oh.
[18:38.530 --> 18:39.730]  Maybe he just ate a chili dog.
[18:40.210 --> 18:41.570]  Suckin' on a chili face.
[18:44.410 --> 18:45.930]  Separated the fuckin' crosswalk already.
[18:46.010 --> 18:46.730]  Oh, there's a dog!
[18:46.830 --> 18:47.930]  There's a dog in that cart!
[18:48.250 --> 18:49.030]  Oh, my God!
[18:49.130 --> 18:49.550]  Cart, dude!
[18:49.810 --> 18:50.050]  Look at that!
[18:50.170 --> 18:51.270]  That's where he was earlier, yeah.
[18:51.370 --> 18:52.370]  He's fuckin' huge!
[18:52.970 --> 18:53.850]  That's a big dog.
[18:55.050 --> 18:56.870]  Oh, look at that wheelchair going across the top.
[18:57.650 --> 18:58.170]  Oh, wow.
[18:58.270 --> 18:58.730]  Hell yeah.
[18:59.450 --> 19:00.070]  Haulin' ass.
[19:00.690 --> 19:02.230]  Ooh, this is a pick-up drop-off.
[19:03.310 --> 19:03.870]  Oh, it is.
[19:03.930 --> 19:04.770]  That is a pick-up drop-off.
[19:04.790 --> 19:05.350]  That is a pick-up drop-off.
[19:05.370 --> 19:06.610]  That is 100%.
[19:06.930 --> 19:07.250]  Yes!
[19:07.970 --> 19:08.290]  Yes!
[19:08.810 --> 19:10.010]  This is escalating quickly.
[19:10.870 --> 19:13.990]  If I get dropped something in formal attire, I got it.
[19:14.370 --> 19:17.890]  As long as Eric doesn't win, I'm happy.
[19:18.530 --> 19:20.010]  Come on, what the fuck?
[19:20.130 --> 19:21.590]  You've won every one of these.
[19:21.790 --> 19:23.690]  Yeah, and I've never gotten a fuckin' cake.
[19:24.190 --> 19:26.410]  Let's go see where that white-haired woman went.
[19:27.270 --> 19:28.450]  Oh, she went across.
[19:28.610 --> 19:29.250]  She went across.
[19:29.310 --> 19:29.750]  She never came.
[19:30.070 --> 19:30.230]  Shit.
[19:31.230 --> 19:31.350]  Yeah.
[19:31.750 --> 19:33.850]  Yo, but for real, whoever wins this, let's go get some cake.
[19:35.030 --> 19:35.390]  Yeah.
[19:36.210 --> 19:37.750]  Let's go get some cake.
[19:38.170 --> 19:39.870]  We're gonna go to the cake store?
[19:40.070 --> 19:41.410]  Oh, it's fuckin' HB, dawg.
[19:42.470 --> 19:45.810]  You zoned in on the, let's get some cake, I zoned in on the, yo, but for real.
[19:46.590 --> 19:47.670]  This is serious.
[19:48.250 --> 19:48.790]  Seriously, guys.
[19:49.230 --> 19:50.190]  We gotta get this cake.
[19:50.690 --> 19:51.150]  Gotta get the cake.
[19:51.150 --> 19:52.190]  Gotta get screwin' around on the cake thing.
[19:53.310 --> 19:54.390]  Oh, that guy was dancin' a little bit.
[19:54.570 --> 19:55.930]  You guys would be a real cake tease.
[19:56.090 --> 19:56.290]  Yeah.
[19:57.150 --> 19:59.370]  Where was Dancing? I didn't see Dancing. Damn it, I need Dancing.
[19:59.390 --> 19:59.550]  Oh!
[20:00.070 --> 20:01.790]  Oh, no, he was, like, bouncin'.
[20:01.790 --> 20:02.970]  For some reason, I keep...
[20:02.970 --> 20:03.910]  Do you need just Dancing or twerking?
[20:04.610 --> 20:05.250]  No, I need Dancing.
[20:05.530 --> 20:05.730]  Oh, okay.
[20:05.730 --> 20:09.810]  I keep thinkin' these security guys are gonna shake hands, and then I just think, why would they do that?
[20:09.950 --> 20:10.430]  That guy's dancin'.
[20:10.430 --> 20:12.770]  That guy just dances way down the street.
[20:12.890 --> 20:15.150]  That wasn't dancing, he was struttin'.
[20:15.150 --> 20:15.510]  Okay.
[20:16.170 --> 20:16.730]  Crosswalk coward!
[20:17.090 --> 20:17.370]  Oh!
[20:18.210 --> 20:18.610]  Separated!
[20:18.830 --> 20:19.790]  Separated the crosswalk!
[20:20.570 --> 20:20.970]  Separated!
[20:21.230 --> 20:23.230]  Separated the crosswalk and a coward!
[20:23.450 --> 20:23.830]  Oh my god!
[20:23.830 --> 20:24.170]  Boom!
[20:24.470 --> 20:24.870]  Whammy!
[20:25.550 --> 20:25.950]  Wow!
[20:26.130 --> 20:27.130]  What a fuckin' huge...
[20:27.130 --> 20:27.990]  That was huge!
[20:28.330 --> 20:31.090]  I am a drop food and or drink item away!
[20:31.430 --> 20:32.090]  Look at that guy.
[20:32.390 --> 20:34.870]  Do you think that person happened to yell, wait up, at the same time?
[20:36.830 --> 20:37.790]  No shot.
[20:38.330 --> 20:38.670]  Damn.
[20:39.510 --> 20:40.550]  Somebody drop something!
[20:41.050 --> 20:42.150]  Oh, there was a little butt grab!
[20:42.390 --> 20:44.930]  There was a little butt grab.
[20:46.710 --> 20:47.590]  But it's not a handshake.
[20:47.890 --> 20:48.630]  Crosswalk butt grab.
[20:49.110 --> 20:49.210]  Okay.
[20:50.570 --> 20:53.110]  Come on, ghost train, where the fuck are you?
[20:54.170 --> 20:58.110]  If a ghost train comes by with a guy with a mullet hangin' out the side, it'd be unreal.
[20:59.550 --> 21:02.330]  While someone double fists off the side of it, yeah.
[21:02.330 --> 21:08.530]  I need ghost train, like the ghost bus thing, or street train, and a pink taxi.
[21:08.870 --> 21:09.510]  Oh, shirtless!
[21:10.530 --> 21:12.110]  Oh, wow, shirt, dude, right there.
[21:12.630 --> 21:12.990]  Shirtless.
[21:14.230 --> 21:15.290]  Do I have a shirtless?
[21:15.930 --> 21:18.270]  Not a lot of beach goths out tonight, man.
[21:18.330 --> 21:19.950]  No, I know, it's a bummer.
[21:20.770 --> 21:22.430]  I think maybe it's just the season, you know?
[21:22.850 --> 21:24.250]  They wait till the kids go to bed, I think.
[21:25.950 --> 21:27.730]  Yeah, man, the freaks come out at night.
[21:32.650 --> 21:34.550]  I thought that one was barefoot. Damn.
[21:35.110 --> 21:36.910]  No, we're not doing that.
[21:37.110 --> 21:41.770]  Do you remember that Houdini rap song, the freaks come out at night from the early 80s, Eric?
[21:42.270 --> 21:43.650]  I'm not bothering asking the others.
[21:45.590 --> 21:50.390]  This guy with the hat here, the blue hat, what's sticking out the back?
[21:50.450 --> 21:51.850]  Is that mullet, or is that...
[21:52.330 --> 21:53.530]  It's like a ponytail?
[21:54.250 --> 21:55.350]  Yeah, I think it's just hair, dude.
[21:56.310 --> 21:57.330]  We need to get closer.
[21:57.390 --> 21:59.130]  It has to be a definitive mullet.
[21:59.130 --> 22:00.350]  Yeah, it's gotta be a mullet.
[22:00.890 --> 22:02.490]  This is Florida, dude, you gotta see a mullet.
[22:02.490 --> 22:05.070]  That looks pretty mullety.
[22:05.870 --> 22:07.090]  Get fucking real.
[22:07.090 --> 22:08.470]  He just has long hair.
[22:08.490 --> 22:11.790]  It definitely could be, but we need him to take the hat off to see.
[22:12.270 --> 22:15.330]  Drop that. Drop it, Tripp, drop it.
[22:16.010 --> 22:18.670]  He's potentially six weeks from a mullet, I think.
[22:18.730 --> 22:19.690]  He needs to drop it.
[22:19.790 --> 22:21.590]  Come back in six weeks and count it.
[22:21.990 --> 22:24.390]  Drop it, Tripp, and then vomit on the street.
[22:24.650 --> 22:25.550]  And that would be fantastic.
[22:25.570 --> 22:26.250]  Start crying.
[22:27.570 --> 22:29.310]  Put on your American flag shirt.
[22:29.450 --> 22:31.110]  And then scream to wait up.
[22:35.790 --> 22:37.950]  So what's everybody need the most?
[22:38.910 --> 22:40.210]  I need drop food or drink.
[22:40.650 --> 22:42.870]  Yeah, drop food or drink and a handshake would do me.
[22:43.450 --> 22:45.490]  I need formal attire and beach goth.
[22:45.870 --> 22:47.470]  Oh, dude, those are gonna be tough.
[22:47.590 --> 22:48.590]  I need Tripp and puking.
[22:49.110 --> 22:51.250]  I could also go formal attire with mullet.
[22:52.150 --> 22:54.670]  Unless someone mistimed their buzz, I'm out of the game.
[22:56.650 --> 22:58.270]  It's early for puke, you know?
[22:58.430 --> 23:02.110]  If I get camera shy and ghost tour, I'm doing okay.
[23:02.210 --> 23:04.110]  But I feel like that ghost tour is so hit or miss.
[23:04.530 --> 23:05.130]  Yeah, right?
[23:05.530 --> 23:06.450]  I still have never seen one.
[23:07.330 --> 23:09.070]  She's wearing a phone on the top of her hand.
[23:09.710 --> 23:10.630]  What? What do you mean?
[23:11.130 --> 23:12.470]  This woman with the ripped jeans.
[23:13.670 --> 23:15.770]  I think she's just holding her phone, isn't she?
[23:16.030 --> 23:17.750]  It's just on the top of her...
[23:17.750 --> 23:19.290]  Like she's got like a...
[23:19.290 --> 23:21.470]  Yeah, like a pop socket or something.
[23:21.510 --> 23:23.170]  She's holding it with one finger.
[23:25.030 --> 23:26.610]  I don't see how you're seeing the other hand.
[23:27.130 --> 23:28.230]  Oh. Oh, I see.
[23:28.510 --> 23:30.230]  Oh, she has like a little...
[23:30.230 --> 23:32.590]  Yeah, like a little handle on it.
[23:33.010 --> 23:33.890]  That's her phone handle.
[23:34.270 --> 23:35.910]  There's her biggest fan in the Adidas shirt.
[23:35.970 --> 23:37.910]  Man next to her is like, where the fuck you get that?
[23:38.510 --> 23:39.650]  How do I get me one of those?
[23:42.230 --> 23:43.570]  Oh, shake her hand.
[23:44.290 --> 23:45.710]  There's a peephole up there.
[23:45.810 --> 23:47.650]  He might have a meemaw behind him.
[23:48.050 --> 23:49.690]  Oh, we never found out about the other meemaw.
[23:50.230 --> 23:51.950]  Oh, three minutes until that kid's out too late.
[23:52.630 --> 23:53.850]  Oh, we're close!
[23:54.610 --> 23:56.590]  If you got a kid out too late, man, you're three minutes away.
[23:57.870 --> 23:59.750]  You say that like it's the Purge.
[24:00.270 --> 24:01.990]  Like the kid alone is going to go off in it.
[24:04.370 --> 24:05.990]  It's the Sloppy Joe Purge.
[24:11.610 --> 24:13.550]  That guy's got brass...
[24:13.550 --> 24:15.530]  Is that brass knuckles on his shirt? Is that offensive?
[24:16.490 --> 24:18.610]  What is she looking up at over there?
[24:18.710 --> 24:20.950]  I think it might have said fuck in the knuckle holes.
[24:23.650 --> 24:25.110]  But I couldn't tell for sure.
[24:30.710 --> 24:32.250]  Drop your drink.
[24:32.870 --> 24:34.510]  That would be cool if somebody did.
[24:34.590 --> 24:35.290]  Or take a selfie.
[24:36.830 --> 24:38.950]  This guy, he's having a great time.
[24:41.790 --> 24:42.290]  Shake.
[24:43.010 --> 24:43.510]  Hands!
[24:43.790 --> 24:45.550]  It'd be cool if a bouncer bounced a little bit.
[24:45.950 --> 24:48.610]  I don't think I've ever seen that.
[24:48.870 --> 24:49.550]  I haven't.
[24:55.000 --> 24:55.900]  How's the...
[24:56.400 --> 24:58.100]  How's the chat and everything going?
[24:58.100 --> 24:58.900]  Are people watching this?
[24:59.060 --> 24:59.880]  Are we live?
[25:00.860 --> 25:02.480]  No, we're not live, Geoff.
[25:02.880 --> 25:03.980]  Geoff, we haven't hit the...
[25:03.980 --> 25:05.200]  What was the number you gave earlier today?
[25:05.380 --> 25:10.120]  I was hoping we'd get up to 500,000 concurrent users.
[25:10.240 --> 25:11.440]  We gotta be close.
[25:12.340 --> 25:13.280]  That's what I was shooting for.
[25:13.740 --> 25:14.420]  We're at 1,800.
[25:15.020 --> 25:17.220]  If everyone brings 20,000 friends, we'll be good.
[25:18.260 --> 25:20.100]  Has anyone gotten bingo in the chat?
[25:20.460 --> 25:20.600]  I wonder.
[25:21.180 --> 25:22.220]  I'm sure they have.
[25:22.520 --> 25:25.820]  And they saw so many things that we didn't even see.
[25:25.820 --> 25:27.160]  That we completely missed.
[25:27.420 --> 25:29.280]  There have been nine skateboards already.
[25:29.980 --> 25:34.220]  I just want this guy to adjust his blue hat and have a full mullet flop out.
[25:35.180 --> 25:36.620]  Dude, I want that for you.
[25:36.760 --> 25:38.500]  That would be pretty vindicating for you, man.
[25:38.520 --> 25:39.040]  There's a hug.
[25:39.660 --> 25:40.560]  I long for it.
[25:40.780 --> 25:42.320]  Because I bet you pick an interesting cake.
[25:44.160 --> 25:46.340]  Oh, that's good. Let's talk about the cakes we'd pick.
[25:46.580 --> 25:48.460]  You would pick that caterpillar cake, right?
[25:48.740 --> 25:49.180]  Oh, yeah!
[25:49.680 --> 25:50.780]  Calling the caterpillar? Hell yeah.
[25:51.700 --> 25:52.840]  It's a clear choice.
[25:54.820 --> 25:55.860]  Gavin sold me on it.
[25:55.920 --> 25:57.260]  I might even pick that if I win.
[25:57.420 --> 25:58.520]  And I don't even know what the hell it is.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.320]  I can vividly remember the sick feeling after eating too much of it.
[26:04.720 --> 26:06.360]  Nick will find that feeling also.
[26:06.540 --> 26:08.640]  Okay, have a look at this guy. That guy just has long hair, dude.
[26:09.740 --> 26:10.660]  It's not a mullet.
[26:11.700 --> 26:13.840]  Oh, she got bumped and she did not like it.
[26:13.860 --> 26:14.940]  Oh, she was pissed.
[26:15.460 --> 26:16.420]  Oh, what's this guy's shirt?
[26:17.340 --> 26:18.840]  Give me some food.
[26:20.460 --> 26:20.780]  Sud?
[26:20.780 --> 26:22.580]  Give me some...
[26:22.580 --> 26:22.900]  Damn it!
[26:25.040 --> 26:25.920]  Something offensive.
[26:26.660 --> 26:28.420]  Alright, the kids are officially out too late.
[26:28.940 --> 26:29.060]  Alright.
[26:31.540 --> 26:35.840]  6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[26:36.240 --> 26:36.660]  There it is.
[26:36.660 --> 26:39.920]  Okay, if you have kids and they're out too late...
[26:39.920 --> 26:41.060]  There's kids at the top!
[26:41.460 --> 26:42.700]  Now if I get MeeMaw and Hoof.
[26:42.700 --> 26:44.640]  Yep, there you go. Kids out too late.
[26:46.340 --> 26:46.780]  MeeMaw?
[26:48.020 --> 26:49.680]  I wouldn't mind if somebody dropped something.
[26:50.340 --> 26:51.420]  Hoof, Hoof, please.
[26:52.660 --> 26:53.540]  I hate that I need
[26:53.540 --> 26:55.740]  food or drinks and not just general drop.
[26:56.220 --> 26:57.740]  Is she wearing an Orioles hat?
[26:59.140 --> 27:00.080]  No, those are cat ears.
[27:00.340 --> 27:01.140]  She is wearing it.
[27:10.660 --> 27:12.400]  Oh, that's a mullet. Is that a mullet?
[27:12.560 --> 27:13.100]  Is that a woman?
[27:14.940 --> 27:16.120]  Are you okay?
[27:17.020 --> 27:19.080]  I just freaked out that I was looking at a mullet,
[27:19.120 --> 27:20.220]  but it's just a woman with hair.
[27:21.140 --> 27:22.720]  Mullets don't gender discriminate.
[27:22.880 --> 27:23.380]  They don't care.
[27:24.040 --> 27:26.320]  She could have a mullet, she just didn't have a mullet.
[27:26.320 --> 27:27.720]  But she doesn't.
[27:28.560 --> 27:30.720]  For somebody who has had a mullet,
[27:30.780 --> 27:32.520]  you have a really bad read on mullets.
[27:36.040 --> 27:37.420]  Gavin waking up in the middle of the night.
[27:37.560 --> 27:38.660]  The mullet, the mullet!
[27:39.580 --> 27:40.140]  What's this?
[27:42.460 --> 27:43.520]  Ghosts and gravestones!
[27:44.080 --> 27:45.600]  All I need is pink taxi!
[27:45.600 --> 27:46.320]  Oh no!
[27:48.240 --> 27:49.720]  I need pink taxi!
[27:50.320 --> 27:51.660]  Oh my god, all I need is pink taxi.
[27:51.680 --> 27:52.840]  I just need camera shy.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.400]  That's going to be so hard.
[27:56.800 --> 27:58.100]  Andrew, what kind of cake should I get?
[27:58.120 --> 27:58.560]  Red velvet?
[27:59.460 --> 28:00.580]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[28:01.540 --> 28:02.800]  Don't get coconut, that's fine.
[28:03.020 --> 28:04.040]  Listen, I don't want you to have it,
[28:04.200 --> 28:06.320]  but I support the choice.
[28:07.380 --> 28:09.540]  German chocolate cake is dog shit, let's be honest.
[28:09.740 --> 28:11.040]  I don't like German chocolate.
[28:11.160 --> 28:11.620]  I don't either.
[28:11.620 --> 28:12.140]  I agree.
[28:13.220 --> 28:14.640]  As long as we're on the same page.
[28:15.500 --> 28:16.860]  I feel like if you're going to get a cake,
[28:16.920 --> 28:18.260]  you're going to want to get a good ice cream.
[28:18.760 --> 28:20.420]  I was going to say ice cream cake might be it.
[28:20.540 --> 28:21.700]  I haven't had one in ages.
[28:23.160 --> 28:25.060]  I don't have them often because my wife
[28:25.060 --> 28:26.900]  doesn't like ice cream and cake together.
[28:27.280 --> 28:27.400]  What?
[28:28.460 --> 28:30.380]  Could she eat one followed by the other?
[28:30.960 --> 28:32.420]  Well, she didn't win bingo, did she?
[28:32.720 --> 28:34.440]  She won't do like at the same time,
[28:34.640 --> 28:36.540]  so I don't have ice cream cake often.
[28:38.800 --> 28:39.660]  That's so sad.
[28:40.320 --> 28:41.000]  Telling me.
[28:41.440 --> 28:43.380]  If she wrote down a list of things she likes
[28:43.380 --> 28:45.560]  and didn't like, I would find that list
[28:46.160 --> 28:46.640]  fascinating.
[28:47.540 --> 28:50.020]  Where do you think Eric would be on the list?
[28:50.780 --> 28:52.080]  Pretty high on the list
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.160]  if he doesn't like it.
[28:53.820 --> 28:55.240]  And when she writes that list,
[28:55.320 --> 28:57.520]  I would love to see it for...
[28:57.520 --> 28:58.820]  Give it to Andrew
[28:59.880 --> 29:01.800]  to drop it in his...
[29:04.060 --> 29:05.340]  Just to look at,
[29:05.440 --> 29:06.400]  for no other reason.
[29:09.980 --> 29:11.160]  That's so funny.
[29:13.320 --> 29:15.320]  Seriously though, go sign up for our Patreon
[29:15.320 --> 29:16.680]  if you want to. It'll be fun.
[29:19.240 --> 29:21.300]  You get to put your name in,
[29:21.380 --> 29:23.240]  and then your credit card information and stuff,
[29:23.320 --> 29:24.460]  and then you can hit a button.
[29:24.740 --> 29:25.840]  It's a blast, dude.
[29:26.280 --> 29:28.440]  It would be high on your list of things you like.
[29:28.760 --> 29:30.120]  Everybody loves pushing buttons.
[29:31.100 --> 29:32.360]  Whoa, they are flashing heads. That's pretty cool.
[29:34.060 --> 29:35.720]  Oh, she's going like the wrong way
[29:35.720 --> 29:36.380]  from her friends.
[29:37.460 --> 29:38.440]  Italian Mafia guy
[29:38.440 --> 29:39.860]  said dog out too late.
[29:43.120 --> 29:44.500]  Italian Mafia guy
[29:44.500 --> 29:46.560]  is letting us know.
[29:48.800 --> 29:50.360]  I would be scared to be
[29:50.360 --> 29:51.540]  that dog's owner right now.
[29:53.020 --> 29:54.260]  He's drawing the wrong kind of attention.
[29:54.300 --> 29:56.280]  Hey, Paisano, that dog's out a little bit late.
[29:59.500 --> 30:00.540]  At first I thought you were
[30:00.540 --> 30:01.900]  referencing someone on the street,
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.860]  and I was looking for someone who
[30:03.860 --> 30:04.780]  might be in the Mafia.
[30:05.200 --> 30:07.720]  Is that an American flag on the guy's hat
[30:07.720 --> 30:09.080]  at the bottom? No.
[30:11.280 --> 30:12.700]  Oh, it's got a fish.
[30:12.980 --> 30:15.660]  It's like Bloody Decks
[30:15.660 --> 30:16.780]  or some stupid shit.
[30:17.120 --> 30:17.700]  Salt Life.
[30:21.480 --> 30:23.760]  Can you believe they disgrace our flag like that, Geoff?
[30:23.960 --> 30:25.220]  I can't. It bothers me, man.
[30:26.280 --> 30:27.940]  I didn't spend five
[30:27.940 --> 30:29.680]  years in this man's army so that
[30:29.680 --> 30:31.940]  they could put a fish on an American flag
[30:31.940 --> 30:33.040]  and call it patriotic.
[30:33.200 --> 30:38.020]  That shit really does annoy the piss out of me.
[30:38.760 --> 30:39.300]  We're aware.
[30:40.900 --> 30:42.900]  I was being funny there.
[30:44.520 --> 30:45.920]  Well, it's just like
[30:46.980 --> 30:48.020]  they're like, don't let it touch
[30:48.020 --> 30:49.920]  the ground, it's sacred. But also, this one's got a
[30:49.920 --> 30:51.880]  fish on it. It's like, where's the line?
[30:52.100 --> 30:53.920]  It doesn't make any sense. I'm going to hang this one up on my
[30:53.920 --> 30:55.160]  fence and let it get rained on.
[30:55.880 --> 30:56.520]  Yes, exactly.
[30:58.780 --> 30:59.340]  Alright.
[30:59.600 --> 31:00.680]  Was that a Bobcat guy?
[31:01.700 --> 31:02.260]  Barefoot.
[31:03.120 --> 31:04.720]  Pink. Taxi.
[31:04.740 --> 31:05.920]  Take a selfie.
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.120]  Drop something.
[31:08.520 --> 31:09.200]  Someone yawn.
[31:10.640 --> 31:11.560]  You're tired.
[31:12.300 --> 31:14.160]  Somebody yawn that's not on this podcast.
[31:14.220 --> 31:15.320]  That guy. That guy's holding up.
[31:15.920 --> 31:17.620]  All four of those guys, turn around.
[31:18.360 --> 31:18.840]  Meemaw.
[31:19.880 --> 31:20.600]  See yawn.
[31:23.280 --> 31:24.840]  Somebody take your shoes off.
[31:24.840 --> 31:25.420]  Yeah.
[31:27.720 --> 31:28.920]  Spread those toes.
[31:31.000 --> 31:32.140]  Suck them dry.
[31:33.260 --> 31:34.860]  I had to walk this street
[31:34.860 --> 31:37.040]  barefoot, remember? I can't remember why.
[31:37.420 --> 31:38.460]  We had dogs out too late?
[31:40.860 --> 31:42.700]  Because we had to walk a mile and a half
[31:42.700 --> 31:44.400]  to the jet ski place.
[31:44.920 --> 31:46.760]  And I went in flip flops, that's right.
[31:47.680 --> 31:48.940]  Oh, did you do the ones that
[31:48.940 --> 31:50.240]  tore up in between your toes?
[31:50.620 --> 31:51.020]  Yeah.
[31:51.020 --> 31:52.620]  Oh, I know that.
[31:52.920 --> 31:55.440]  The hard plastic fucking gas station ones?
[31:56.000 --> 31:56.800]  Oh, dude. Ouch.
[31:57.540 --> 31:58.480]  Was that the day
[31:58.820 --> 32:00.620]  Emily washed me with her jet ski?
[32:01.160 --> 32:01.900]  Yes, it was.
[32:01.940 --> 32:03.840]  And washed the underside of a bridge?
[32:05.840 --> 32:07.060]  It was hilarious.
[32:07.880 --> 32:09.120]  Emily was the only one
[32:09.120 --> 32:11.020]  of us to have a jet ski with one of those
[32:11.020 --> 32:12.360]  rooster tails in the back.
[32:12.940 --> 32:15.120]  And Gavin was right behind her. We were in a straight line.
[32:15.380 --> 32:17.180]  And she just doused
[32:17.180 --> 32:19.060]  him the entire fucking hour
[32:19.060 --> 32:19.620]  and a half.
[32:20.540 --> 32:22.880]  Like somebody just sprayed a hose in his face.
[32:23.200 --> 32:25.120]  I think across the whole trip, I probably had
[32:25.120 --> 32:27.120]  500 gallons of water land on me.
[32:29.800 --> 32:30.620]  That was awesome.
[32:34.200 --> 32:35.180]  That was such a fun
[32:35.180 --> 32:36.760]  jet ski trip. That was a hug. That was a great
[32:36.760 --> 32:38.180]  Key West trip. That was a great one.
[32:38.940 --> 32:40.940]  Sunglasses at night, now we're really starting to repeat ourselves
[32:40.940 --> 32:41.840]  hard. Yeah.
[32:44.060 --> 32:44.600]  Bald guy.
[32:47.680 --> 32:49.260]  Nick's just making shit up.
[32:50.580 --> 32:51.160]  Backpack.
[32:52.460 --> 32:53.040]  Hiker.
[32:53.160 --> 32:54.100]  Adidas shirt.
[32:57.000 --> 32:57.580]  Sweatpants.
[32:59.800 --> 33:00.800]  Dream of the beach.
[33:01.780 --> 33:02.760]  Duh, bears.
[33:05.980 --> 33:06.740]  Smoking a cig.
[33:08.420 --> 33:11.160]  I think that is one, isn't it?
[33:11.180 --> 33:13.820]  Maybe it is. I don't remember it's been so long.
[33:15.500 --> 33:16.680]  That's a cool purse.
[33:17.740 --> 33:18.180]  Binwheels.
[33:18.400 --> 33:20.360]  I wonder what kind of cigarette that is.
[33:21.280 --> 33:21.720]  Okay.
[33:22.280 --> 33:24.400]  You okay, Nick? Sorry, I just had a moment.
[33:24.960 --> 33:25.720]  It's been a long day.
[33:26.400 --> 33:27.340]  Jonesing for it, you know?
[33:30.460 --> 33:31.280]  Marlboro Red, huh?
[33:32.960 --> 33:34.280]  Aw man, that's all cool.
[33:35.320 --> 33:35.940]  Oh, Jesus.
[33:36.220 --> 33:38.060]  He's also the opposite of Marlboro Red.
[33:38.880 --> 33:40.460]  I just learned so much about Nick.
[33:40.780 --> 33:41.220]  Yep.
[33:42.100 --> 33:44.140]  Oh, Nick from 10 years ago or whatever.
[33:44.140 --> 33:44.680]  Yeah.
[33:45.580 --> 33:47.440]  You ever think about being a Zen guy, Nick?
[33:48.100 --> 33:48.560]  A what now?
[33:50.340 --> 33:52.360]  That guy almost got hit by a car.
[33:52.480 --> 33:52.840]  That was close.
[33:52.860 --> 33:55.040]  If anybody has that, you can count it.
[33:57.080 --> 33:58.420]  You haven't seen those Zins?
[33:58.580 --> 33:59.960]  Like the little Zen packs that you put
[33:59.960 --> 34:01.340]  in your lip like it's dip?
[34:01.500 --> 34:03.020]  What are you saying?
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.440]  Are you talking about those little pouches?
[34:06.180 --> 34:07.200]  Z-Y-N, yeah.
[34:07.700 --> 34:09.040]  No, but now that you...
[34:10.380 --> 34:11.620]  It's just nicotine.
[34:11.620 --> 34:12.680]  Oh, good. Great.
[34:12.880 --> 34:15.520]  That's just the only other bad part.
[34:16.060 --> 34:16.360]  Yeah.
[34:17.440 --> 34:19.660]  Like, so many people are addicted
[34:19.660 --> 34:21.640]  to nicotine again. It's fucking crazy.
[34:23.020 --> 34:24.000]  I don't...
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.320]  I don't want to go down that road, man.
[34:25.840 --> 34:26.140]  Nope.
[34:27.600 --> 34:29.520]  But nicotine, it's resourceful.
[34:29.640 --> 34:31.900]  It always finds a way back in your mouth, doesn't it?
[34:31.960 --> 34:33.240]  It's just like...
[34:33.240 --> 34:34.940]  It's just like the worst one.
[34:35.480 --> 34:36.520]  Nicotine is just like...
[34:36.520 --> 34:37.280]  It's the worst.
[34:37.800 --> 34:38.700]  It's the worst.
[34:38.880 --> 34:40.360]  But also, boy, does it put you at ease.
[34:40.440 --> 34:41.660]  But also, boy, does it tear you up.
[34:41.780 --> 34:44.880]  But also, boy...
[34:45.600 --> 34:46.520]  It's unfortunate.
[34:46.880 --> 34:48.960]  There's unfortunate but alsos.
[34:49.720 --> 34:50.680]  Oh, sick!
[34:51.260 --> 34:52.340]  That guy's super cool.
[34:53.340 --> 34:54.520]  Except he's wearing a helmet.
[34:54.860 --> 34:55.280]  Boo!
[34:56.460 --> 34:57.560]  Take it off!
[34:57.800 --> 34:59.020]  I'm safe!
[35:01.040 --> 35:02.000]  Another dog.
[35:04.080 --> 35:04.560]  That's...
[35:04.560 --> 35:07.060]  God, I wish I could count that as a beach goth.
[35:07.200 --> 35:07.840]  Me too!
[35:08.140 --> 35:10.380]  I was going to say the same thing, but I went, eh, no shot.
[35:10.840 --> 35:11.140]  Nick!
[35:12.880 --> 35:13.600]  Nick! Rick!
[35:15.420 --> 35:15.780]  Rick!
[35:17.000 --> 35:17.360]  Rick.
[35:18.120 --> 35:20.180]  Nick gets far away to restart the stream.
[35:22.680 --> 35:23.980]  Nick, why don't you get a stick?
[35:25.700 --> 35:26.620]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[35:26.620 --> 35:28.100]  Also, the YouTube feed is back, Nick.
[35:28.400 --> 35:29.860]  Nick has a stream stick.
[35:30.280 --> 35:32.600]  Oh my God, is that a...
[35:32.600 --> 35:33.820]  What is happening?
[35:33.980 --> 35:35.380]  Are you saying a pink taxi?
[35:36.060 --> 35:39.120]  Look how low down those guys' sunglasses are on his head.
[35:39.140 --> 35:39.940]  Oh my God!
[35:40.860 --> 35:42.220]  They're like, by his eyes.
[35:42.680 --> 35:42.780]  Yeah.
[35:45.260 --> 35:46.720]  I understood what you meant,
[35:46.800 --> 35:49.600]  but criticizing someone for having their sunglasses by their eyes
[35:49.600 --> 35:50.980]  is on the surface
[35:50.980 --> 35:53.160]  seems like a ridiculous statement.
[35:53.620 --> 35:55.880]  This fucking guy's got sunglasses by his eyes!
[35:56.180 --> 35:57.260]  Well, normally they're either on
[35:57.260 --> 35:58.700]  or they're as far away as possible.
[35:59.680 --> 36:01.320]  That guy's really tall!
[36:01.320 --> 36:02.880]  Holy shit!
[36:03.060 --> 36:04.260]  That guy's so tall!
[36:04.740 --> 36:06.020]  I bet he's never heard that.
[36:06.340 --> 36:08.620]  She has her camera out. She might be taking a selfie.
[36:09.120 --> 36:10.820]  Yeah, but we can't see it.
[36:10.860 --> 36:13.120]  But she might swing back in. Hold on.
[36:13.660 --> 36:15.300]  She might be taking a selfie
[36:15.300 --> 36:17.240]  with a barefoot skateboarder
[36:17.240 --> 36:18.920]  in formal attire.
[36:19.280 --> 36:19.940]  Right off camera.
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.440]  After he dropped his bag.
[36:26.400 --> 36:27.500]  Take your shoes off, lady.
[36:28.040 --> 36:29.400]  Wouldn't it be cool if someone
[36:30.360 --> 36:32.340]  walked by holding a sign
[36:32.340 --> 36:34.100]  that just said patreon.com
[36:34.100 --> 36:36.340]  slash regulation pod.
[36:36.720 --> 36:38.120]  That already happened, though.
[36:38.180 --> 36:38.560]  Call the twins.
[36:40.180 --> 36:41.500]  Yeah, they've already got those signs.
[36:42.060 --> 36:43.640]  What are you doing right now?
[36:45.140 --> 36:46.560]  Can you add Patreon to the front?
[36:49.580 --> 36:50.680]  Where's the nearest Kinko's?
[36:50.980 --> 36:52.240]  Well, I just looked away
[36:52.240 --> 36:54.080]  from the stream for the very first time
[36:54.080 --> 36:56.280]  to check my phone, and all I see is an ESPN alert
[36:56.280 --> 36:58.360]  that says Tatum aggressive in game
[36:58.360 --> 36:59.800]  three. I have no idea what that means.
[36:59.800 --> 37:01.400]  I think you might be up by ten.
[37:01.940 --> 37:02.460]  Ugh.
[37:03.600 --> 37:04.540]  Dear God.
[37:08.150 --> 37:09.470]  Those are some loud crocs.
[37:10.090 --> 37:10.610]  Pink?
[37:11.270 --> 37:12.270]  They are, Jesus.
[37:13.110 --> 37:14.450]  That's a drunk hulk!
[37:14.710 --> 37:15.450]  That's a drunk hulk!
[37:15.870 --> 37:16.390]  Uh oh!
[37:17.450 --> 37:17.890]  Whoa!
[37:21.390 --> 37:22.830]  Dude, he needs those.
[37:22.970 --> 37:23.970]  He's gonna go!
[37:24.690 --> 37:26.350]  I think I might have fallen over.
[37:26.750 --> 37:29.070]  We could get handshaked by accident just from stumbling.
[37:29.070 --> 37:30.290]  Whoa, his legs!
[37:31.050 --> 37:32.790]  Oh, he's not gonna make it.
[37:33.110 --> 37:34.930]  That guy is wrecked.
[37:35.570 --> 37:36.470]  He's on the phone.
[37:41.040 --> 37:42.280]  Is that person helping to
[37:42.280 --> 37:42.720]  steady him?
[37:44.560 --> 37:46.460]  That person's a pole, I think.
[37:48.100 --> 37:50.040]  If he falls over, can I consider that
[37:50.040 --> 37:51.160]  as a dropped something?
[37:51.860 --> 37:53.940]  He dropped himself. I think that counts.
[37:55.060 --> 37:55.800]  Dropped human.
[37:56.720 --> 37:57.500]  Is that a dog?
[37:58.800 --> 37:59.580]  Oh, it's a dog.
[37:59.580 --> 38:00.380]  It is a dog.
[38:00.680 --> 38:02.060]  We need to add a dog to here.
[38:02.380 --> 38:03.180]  We do.
[38:05.660 --> 38:07.120]  To the bigger thing, obviously.
[38:07.220 --> 38:08.300]  Not a dog Patreon tier.
[38:08.760 --> 38:10.580]  We need to add a dog Patreon tier.
[38:11.300 --> 38:13.160]  $500 a month will mail you a dog.
[38:14.240 --> 38:15.300]  We got dogs.
[38:15.400 --> 38:16.140]  We can take pictures of dogs.
[38:16.140 --> 38:16.960]  Nickel train it.
[38:18.620 --> 38:19.680]  Oh, different security.
[38:21.240 --> 38:22.140]  He's from somewhere else.
[38:23.080 --> 38:25.340]  I think it's a bar next block over.
[38:25.820 --> 38:26.500]  Hey, hi!
[38:26.500 --> 38:26.840]  Hi!
[38:27.520 --> 38:27.980]  Bye!
[38:31.660 --> 38:32.860]  Oh, what's going on here?
[38:33.280 --> 38:34.520]  Are they holding hands
[38:34.520 --> 38:35.080]  or shaking hands?
[38:35.420 --> 38:36.180]  They're just petting the dog.
[38:36.580 --> 38:40.480]  Are they holding hands or shaking hands?
[38:41.880 --> 38:43.440]  Kissing the dog's head.
[38:43.620 --> 38:46.620]  Oh, that swaying guy
[38:46.620 --> 38:48.200]  is still there. He's still up there.
[38:48.440 --> 38:49.900]  Yeah, I'm locked in on him.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.500]  I feel like it's that
[38:52.500 --> 38:54.700]  scene from The Office where Michael thinks
[38:54.700 --> 38:56.440]  he saw Tina Fey and then Conan
[38:56.440 --> 38:56.980]  walks by.
[38:58.880 --> 38:59.840]  Drop something!
[39:00.520 --> 39:02.740]  100% drop something.
[39:02.820 --> 39:03.160]  Right there.
[39:04.560 --> 39:06.160]  Is that guy drunk walking?
[39:06.480 --> 39:07.180]  Is that drunk walking?
[39:08.860 --> 39:10.760]  Is dropped or spilled
[39:10.760 --> 39:12.440]  food or drink? Are we going to say that's it or no?
[39:12.460 --> 39:13.600]  No, it's drop something.
[39:13.960 --> 39:15.560]  I just need twerking.
[39:19.440 --> 39:20.580]  I need a handshake
[39:20.580 --> 39:21.240]  and formal attire.
[39:21.240 --> 39:22.180]  Oh, I gotta think about a cake.
[39:22.620 --> 39:25.380]  Oh, that kid is out way too late.
[39:27.040 --> 39:28.800]  I feel like we should...
[39:28.800 --> 39:29.400]  Oh, fuck.
[39:30.700 --> 39:32.340]  I was going to say I feel like we should say
[39:32.880 --> 39:34.740]  something. I was going to remind the audience about something
[39:34.740 --> 39:36.480]  and then I forgot what I was going to say mid-sentence.
[39:36.620 --> 39:37.700]  Oh, that's great. The Patreon?
[39:39.280 --> 39:41.000]  No, something about the rules of this game.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.380]  Oh, there he goes.
[39:44.040 --> 39:45.140]  He's helping him.
[39:46.340 --> 39:46.840]  There's a cop.
[39:47.560 --> 39:49.140]  He almost didn't make it.
[39:51.280 --> 39:53.260]  Crocs got away before the cops found him.
[39:53.420 --> 39:54.280]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[39:55.760 --> 39:57.500]  Dog. Dog. Dog sniffing cop.
[39:58.160 --> 39:59.180]  Oh, I remember what I was going to say.
[39:59.540 --> 40:01.000]  I feel like we should also mention to the audience
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.860]  that everybody you see is like 15%
[40:03.860 --> 40:05.880]  drunker than they look at this angle.
[40:06.080 --> 40:06.520]  Yes. Interesting.
[40:08.460 --> 40:09.460]  At eye level,
[40:09.560 --> 40:10.860]  they're all way
[40:11.320 --> 40:13.320]  sloppier. Oh, that cop is looking for that
[40:13.320 --> 40:14.680]  fucking drunk guy. That's what I thought.
[40:14.760 --> 40:16.160]  I think he's looking for Yosemite Sam.
[40:16.600 --> 40:19.240]  He's going to help
[40:19.240 --> 40:20.040]  with the Humber FUD, yeah.
[40:21.800 --> 40:22.940]  He's like, uh, we got a report
[40:22.940 --> 40:24.220]  from a Mr. E. FUD.
[40:26.280 --> 40:26.920]  He's looking for
[40:26.920 --> 40:28.480]  a wascally wabbit?
[40:30.820 --> 40:31.340]  Oh, you got
[40:31.340 --> 40:31.940]  some pizza, huh?
[40:32.320 --> 40:35.220]  I have it, but
[40:35.220 --> 40:36.800]  it hasn't happened yet.
[40:37.340 --> 40:39.240]  Pizza sounds really good right now.
[40:40.200 --> 40:41.180]  Cake sounds really
[40:41.180 --> 40:41.760]  good right now.
[40:43.080 --> 40:44.960]  I'm a pink taxi away from a cake, baby.
[40:45.320 --> 40:47.140]  Oh, drop that drink. Drop that drink. It's slippery.
[40:47.140 --> 40:47.680]  It's slippery.
[40:47.840 --> 40:50.780]  I just need camera-shy or formal attire.
[40:51.820 --> 40:53.120]  Would it be illegal
[40:53.120 --> 40:55.260]  if I ordered a cake without winning?
[40:56.440 --> 40:56.860]  Does that go
[40:56.860 --> 40:58.040]  against the spirit of the game?
[40:59.380 --> 41:01.080]  You're not legally allowed to order
[41:01.080 --> 41:03.180]  a cake till tomorrow. Are you sending it to us?
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.460]  Like, out of the goodness of your heart?
[41:04.760 --> 41:04.940]  No.
[41:06.880 --> 41:08.540]  I like that he laughed at you.
[41:09.400 --> 41:11.240]  Now, you can order a cake
[41:11.240 --> 41:13.220]  tonight, but it can't arrive till tomorrow.
[41:13.640 --> 41:14.160]  Yeah. No.
[41:14.160 --> 41:16.480]  Oh, okay. That defeats the whole purpose.
[41:17.460 --> 41:18.040]  It really does.
[41:18.940 --> 41:20.540]  What if it's like an ice cream pizza?
[41:21.440 --> 41:21.720]  Oh, dude.
[41:22.020 --> 41:23.900]  Check it out. Check it out. Red versus blue.
[41:24.460 --> 41:24.580]  Damn.
[41:27.840 --> 41:28.680]  Fucking stupid.
[41:29.000 --> 41:29.900]  God, I wish they'd fought.
[41:30.180 --> 41:30.960]  I need that.
[41:33.800 --> 41:35.300]  Formal attire, mullet.
[41:35.940 --> 41:37.340]  Doesn't somebody want to ruin their relationship
[41:37.340 --> 41:39.500]  on camera right now? Anyone, please?
[41:40.100 --> 41:40.840]  I'm never going to get...
[41:40.840 --> 41:41.840]  It's called pink fucking taxi.
[41:43.080 --> 41:44.040]  Has anyone ever
[41:44.040 --> 41:45.180]  walked up to you, Geoff, and said,
[41:45.280 --> 41:46.080]  you sound like Griff?
[41:46.920 --> 41:47.440]  Really?
[41:49.300 --> 41:51.080]  Over the last 21 years?
[41:51.300 --> 41:51.960]  Wait a minute.
[41:53.320 --> 41:55.860]  Especially early on, before we were on camera a lot.
[41:56.200 --> 41:57.300]  That makes sense.
[41:57.480 --> 41:59.480]  I did that with the
[41:59.480 --> 42:01.320]  Halo multiplayer announcer guy.
[42:02.380 --> 42:03.800]  Really? That's a fun one.
[42:04.240 --> 42:05.880]  I was on the same job
[42:05.880 --> 42:06.140]  with him.
[42:08.200 --> 42:09.600]  That guy is so sweet.
[42:09.600 --> 42:11.400]  Yeah. Geoff Steitzer.
[42:11.580 --> 42:11.980]  He's a legend.
[42:15.820 --> 42:17.100]  I'm not even...
[42:17.100 --> 42:19.180]  That is a little bit...
[42:19.180 --> 42:19.980]  You know what, Gav?
[42:20.260 --> 42:21.140]  That's a mullet.
[42:21.540 --> 42:23.100]  That guy had a mullet, man.
[42:23.340 --> 42:24.760]  The guy crossing the street?
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.400]  No, the guy with the hat who's about to turn.
[42:27.620 --> 42:28.540]  That's a mullet, dude.
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.680]  We'll give it to him.
[42:32.220 --> 42:33.620]  Out of the goodness of our hearts.
[42:34.280 --> 42:35.160]  We're benevolent.
[42:36.260 --> 42:37.940]  That's also a mullet, 100%.
[42:37.940 --> 42:39.500]  That's, without a doubt,
[42:40.300 --> 42:40.540]  something.
[42:42.280 --> 42:43.920]  That is, without a doubt,
[42:44.060 --> 42:44.420]  something.
[42:45.760 --> 42:46.820]  Alright, just need formal attire.
[42:47.880 --> 42:49.900]  That man looks so happy.
[42:50.600 --> 42:52.020]  That's the happiest old man
[42:52.020 --> 42:53.460]  I've ever seen. Good for him.
[42:54.580 --> 42:55.800]  Alright, Gavin, I also
[42:55.800 --> 42:57.780]  only need formal attire, so I guess
[42:57.780 --> 43:00.080]  if it pops up, it's whoever says it first.
[43:00.680 --> 43:01.060]  Wow.
[43:01.480 --> 43:04.360]  And if somebody else
[43:04.360 --> 43:06.000]  says it first, then maybe we share?
[43:06.800 --> 43:10.120]  You guys both have to eat half a cake.
[43:10.300 --> 43:11.820]  She has jeans and flip flops on,
[43:11.900 --> 43:12.980]  but I think we already got that.
[43:13.200 --> 43:14.100]  Oh yeah, we already got that, baby.
[43:14.500 --> 43:16.480]  Is someone going to get split up at this crosswalk?
[43:16.720 --> 43:17.020]  Nah.
[43:18.380 --> 43:20.320]  Those are crosswalk pros right there.
[43:27.490 --> 43:29.270]  I have cover band playing Green Day
[43:29.270 --> 43:31.110]  or Blink 182, so I'm trying to listen to that.
[43:31.110 --> 43:33.330]  We need to remove those from the board,
[43:33.430 --> 43:34.690]  I think, going forward.
[43:35.730 --> 43:37.470]  Yeah, let's redo our board
[43:37.470 --> 43:38.590]  for the new podcast.
[43:39.050 --> 43:40.430]  Yeah, I wouldn't mind doing that as well.
[43:41.510 --> 43:42.350]  Because I wanted to add
[43:42.350 --> 43:44.330]  New Boot Goofin, that's one that Emily and I
[43:44.330 --> 43:45.870]  were playing with at the end that was so much fun.
[43:48.790 --> 43:49.930]  And then Dickhead Truck
[43:49.930 --> 43:51.010]  was one we wanted to put in.
[43:51.110 --> 43:53.510]  I want to add Headsheen.
[43:54.710 --> 43:55.610]  Headsheen is a good one.
[43:56.050 --> 43:58.110]  Headsheen's a good one.
[43:58.570 --> 43:59.470]  Something with a dog.
[44:00.830 --> 44:01.690]  Something with a dog.
[44:02.110 --> 44:02.890]  Dog out too late.
[44:04.550 --> 44:05.810]  What if we do combos?
[44:05.970 --> 44:08.350]  Like if someone's on a bike and there's a dog in the frame
[44:08.350 --> 44:09.770]  at the same time, we could have dog and hog.
[44:10.150 --> 44:11.450]  Oh, dog and hog's good.
[44:11.790 --> 44:12.770]  Dog and hog?
[44:13.310 --> 44:14.690]  But they have to share the frame.
[44:18.010 --> 44:19.950]  The pink taxi thing's killing me, dude.
[44:20.310 --> 44:21.990]  Oh, I know. That was the last time for me.
[44:22.770 --> 44:24.690]  I think they've painted a bunch of theirs.
[44:25.850 --> 44:27.910]  I think there's a lot less pink taxis riding around.
[44:28.010 --> 44:28.690]  But they do exist.
[44:29.250 --> 44:30.290]  They do, we've seen them.
[44:34.520 --> 44:37.600]  I can't believe how drunk the high-vis Crocs guy was.
[44:37.700 --> 44:38.200]  That was insane.
[44:38.200 --> 44:39.420]  That was crazy.
[44:41.260 --> 44:41.980]  Bachelorette party.
[44:42.240 --> 44:43.100]  Bachelorette party.
[44:44.480 --> 44:45.200]  I got that.
[44:45.740 --> 44:47.260]  Twerk, twerk.
[44:49.020 --> 44:50.860]  I'm a dead parrot head away.
[44:51.620 --> 44:52.060]  Take a selfie.
[44:52.280 --> 44:54.400]  It's weird when you say it to people, Nick.
[44:54.720 --> 44:55.840]  I don't want to see it.
[44:55.940 --> 44:56.740]  I just want it to happen.
[44:58.800 --> 45:03.470]  Oh, come on.
[45:04.630 --> 45:06.310]  Give me a dead parrot head.
[45:06.310 --> 45:06.390]  Dude.
[45:08.150 --> 45:10.170]  Somebody be camera shy.
[45:11.690 --> 45:12.990]  What's that guy holding?
[45:13.570 --> 45:14.770]  Good lord, it's Larry David.
[45:15.290 --> 45:16.210]  Oh, another wheelchair.
[45:16.650 --> 45:18.150]  Look at him scoot here.
[45:18.550 --> 45:20.510]  Really proved Andrew wrong tonight.
[45:20.990 --> 45:22.490]  Listen, I was due.
[45:24.370 --> 45:26.470]  Yeah, and this is all you're ever going to see of it.
[45:27.270 --> 45:27.850]  That's fine.
[45:28.330 --> 45:28.490]  Yeah.
[45:29.470 --> 45:30.690]  I can die happy.
[45:31.730 --> 45:33.330]  We've got to add scooter.
[45:34.650 --> 45:35.750]  We've got a scooter on that.
[45:36.170 --> 45:37.070]  Never mind, I'm an idiot.
[45:37.370 --> 45:37.950]  Crazy mohawk.
[45:47.010 --> 45:48.230]  There's so many people
[45:48.230 --> 45:50.430]  in such little action happening.
[45:51.090 --> 45:51.330]  I know.
[45:51.670 --> 45:54.050]  Is that a memaw?
[45:54.550 --> 45:55.010]  No.
[45:55.570 --> 45:57.430]  Oh, no.
[45:58.370 --> 46:00.210]  The woman that was questionable earlier
[46:00.210 --> 46:01.310]  was more memaw than that.
[46:01.370 --> 46:01.890]  You're right.
[46:02.030 --> 46:03.670]  I wish I could say it was, but it's not.
[46:04.930 --> 46:05.910]  We've definitely hit
[46:05.910 --> 46:08.010]  the doldrum portion.
[46:08.250 --> 46:09.070]  Oh, he drops something.
[46:09.490 --> 46:10.030]  What is that?
[46:10.810 --> 46:11.350]  Food?
[46:12.250 --> 46:13.930]  I think it might have been.
[46:15.430 --> 46:17.090]  That's a bingo!
[46:17.690 --> 46:17.750]  Yeah.
[46:19.470 --> 46:20.910]  Bingo! Cake!
[46:21.330 --> 46:22.350]  I'm getting my cake!
[46:22.490 --> 46:23.090]  It wasn't food.
[46:24.470 --> 46:25.070]  It was drink.
[46:26.470 --> 46:28.550]  It was the cap to his drink.
[46:30.450 --> 46:31.970]  It has to count.
[46:31.970 --> 46:33.030]  It's part of the drink.
[46:33.030 --> 46:34.350]  It has to count.
[46:34.550 --> 46:36.250]  You drink it from the cap?
[46:38.650 --> 46:40.350]  But when you buy the drink,
[46:40.410 --> 46:41.450]  it comes with the cap.
[46:41.970 --> 46:43.330]  Yeah, I don't...
[46:43.870 --> 46:45.530]  What does that mean, Nick?
[46:46.070 --> 46:46.930]  You don't drink from a cap.
[46:47.970 --> 46:48.970]  Yeah, we might have to give it to him.
[46:49.250 --> 46:49.510]  Alright.
[46:50.770 --> 46:52.610]  I think dropped covers it.
[46:54.550 --> 46:55.750]  So that's a bingo?
[46:56.230 --> 46:57.030]  That's a bingo.
[46:58.670 --> 46:59.550]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[46:59.550 --> 47:01.450]  Andrew, you won your first bingo.
[47:01.610 --> 47:02.810]  What kind of cake are you going to get?
[47:03.130 --> 47:04.670]  I'm getting an ice cream cake right now.
[47:06.170 --> 47:07.170]  Let's get details.
[47:10.230 --> 47:11.110]  While you're doing that,
[47:11.190 --> 47:12.590]  should we regenerate the board?
[47:14.110 --> 47:15.630]  I'm down for another one.
[47:18.470 --> 47:19.070]  Let's play for second place.
[47:19.070 --> 47:19.590]  Yeah, let's play for second place.
[47:20.030 --> 47:20.050]  Yeah.
[47:21.310 --> 47:23.650]  Andrew can play for the full board if he's still there.
[47:23.870 --> 47:24.250]  What do we get?
[47:25.230 --> 47:27.410]  Second place gets one cookie.
[47:27.410 --> 47:29.550]  Yeah, I was going to say it's got to be a cookie.
[47:29.770 --> 47:30.270]  Cookie cake?
[47:31.330 --> 47:32.850]  No, it's one cookie.
[47:32.970 --> 47:35.010]  It can't be a Great American Cookie Company cookie
[47:35.010 --> 47:36.150]  that's the size of a pizza.
[47:37.590 --> 47:38.530]  My wife worked there.
[47:38.650 --> 47:41.010]  The biggest cookie you can get is that one at Costco.
[47:41.190 --> 47:41.570]  That's it.
[47:43.410 --> 47:44.430]  That's a pretty big cookie.
[47:44.970 --> 47:45.850]  Who's the let's go?
[47:46.350 --> 47:47.830]  We are not going with you.
[47:49.470 --> 47:51.330]  Also, Costco's not open right now.
[47:51.550 --> 47:52.330]  I mean, not right now.
[47:52.870 --> 47:54.030]  Chug, chug, chug.
[47:54.730 --> 47:56.130]  That was a drink.
[47:56.330 --> 47:57.350]  I'd say it was a swig.
[47:58.190 --> 48:00.130]  Yeah, it was a swig.
[48:00.190 --> 48:01.750]  Oh, are they going to high five or handshake or something?
[48:02.030 --> 48:02.510]  What are you doing?
[48:04.790 --> 48:05.850]  Are these bouncers
[48:06.890 --> 48:07.770]  technically bouncing?
[48:08.050 --> 48:09.390]  That is a bouncer bouncing.
[48:10.150 --> 48:11.130]  Oh, get real.
[48:11.730 --> 48:12.870]  He checked an idea.
[48:13.150 --> 48:13.890]  No way.
[48:14.190 --> 48:17.090]  That is not what you would consider bouncing.
[48:17.550 --> 48:19.630]  Bouncing is like they're getting thrown out.
[48:19.710 --> 48:21.590]  Bouncing is like tossing someone out.
[48:21.590 --> 48:22.650]  Okay, okay, fine.
[48:22.930 --> 48:24.490]  I guess no one got bounced.
[48:25.690 --> 48:26.230]  That's fair.
[48:27.250 --> 48:29.130]  That was close. That would have been bigger for me there.
[48:29.670 --> 48:30.230]  Sorry, bud.
[48:30.390 --> 48:32.350]  I would have totally let you get away with it.
[48:32.830 --> 48:33.510]  Appreciate it.
[48:37.120 --> 48:39.400]  I'd have given it to you if you'd agreed with me on the cap.
[48:39.580 --> 48:39.920]  But whatever.
[48:43.160 --> 48:44.000]  Another bachelorette party.
[48:44.500 --> 48:44.860]  Bachelorette.
[48:45.640 --> 48:46.360]  Scratching his tummy.
[48:47.540 --> 48:49.180]  Why does her hat look like Popeye?
[48:50.120 --> 48:50.600]  I don't know.
[48:50.600 --> 48:51.320]  Come on, pink taxi.
[48:51.340 --> 48:52.520]  It's a nautical themed wedding.
[48:56.320 --> 48:58.760]  Ooh, the bagel sandwich is back at McDonald's.
[48:58.800 --> 48:59.220]  I keep forgetting.
[49:00.260 --> 49:01.380]  You don't like a bagel?
[49:01.580 --> 49:03.200]  Dude, I love the bagel breakfast sandwich.
[49:04.800 --> 49:05.580]  There was a commercial for it.
[49:05.580 --> 49:09.540]  How do people who hold hands for extended periods, how do they not get just covered in sweat?
[49:10.440 --> 49:11.900]  Especially in Key West.
[49:12.120 --> 49:12.300]  Yeah.
[49:12.880 --> 49:15.780]  Key West is a sweaty kind of place.
[49:15.800 --> 49:16.660]  24 hours a day.
[49:16.920 --> 49:18.960]  I can hold hands maximum two minutes.
[49:20.260 --> 49:20.720]  Maximum?
[49:20.720 --> 49:22.880]  You're just catching the two minutes that they're holding hands.
[49:23.400 --> 49:23.840]  Maybe.
[49:24.380 --> 49:25.520]  Maybe it's just for the camera.
[49:26.580 --> 49:28.620]  Maximum two minutes is not a long time.
[49:28.940 --> 49:29.380]  No, I know.
[49:29.840 --> 49:32.040]  I don't really have the stamina when it comes to hand-holding.
[49:32.080 --> 49:33.860]  Is that a point of contention with Meg?
[49:34.080 --> 49:36.060]  Does she find you deficient in the hand-holding?
[49:36.080 --> 49:36.900]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[49:37.920 --> 49:44.040]  My problem is, my hands don't sweat very well, so I just get hot, dry hands.
[49:46.940 --> 49:49.240]  So the sweat of the other person is the problem?
[49:50.260 --> 49:50.700]  No, it's not.
[49:50.700 --> 49:52.360]  Your hands just turn into little furnaces.
[49:53.100 --> 49:54.520]  Just get really hot.
[50:04.350 --> 50:05.530]  Pink fucking taxi!
[50:05.690 --> 50:06.310]  Come on!
[50:07.370 --> 50:09.470]  How about some formal attire?
[50:09.570 --> 50:10.710]  Are you already eating the cake?
[50:11.430 --> 50:11.770]  No.
[50:12.950 --> 50:14.510]  I wish I was.
[50:14.850 --> 50:16.770]  What's the flavor profile?
[50:18.610 --> 50:20.610]  Maybe like an Oreo ice cream cake?
[50:20.610 --> 50:21.770]  Oh, fuck.
[50:21.850 --> 50:24.150]  I've never had that.
[50:25.910 --> 50:27.030]  You've never had that?
[50:27.150 --> 50:27.470]  Oh, man.
[50:28.610 --> 50:31.350]  I don't think I've had an ice cream cake, but it sounds great.
[50:31.610 --> 50:31.930]  Motherfucker.
[50:32.030 --> 50:33.450]  Hey, is that lady a beach goth, Eric?
[50:33.970 --> 50:36.170]  I would say yes.
[50:36.190 --> 50:37.350]  She's got dyed black hair.
[50:37.450 --> 50:39.730]  She's got combat boots on.
[50:40.710 --> 50:42.970]  That's a beach goth and a half right there.
[50:43.410 --> 50:44.270]  Oh, fuck!
[50:44.470 --> 50:45.290]  I'm still one away.
[50:45.850 --> 50:47.590]  I just need formal attire two different ways now.
[50:47.590 --> 50:48.750]  God damn it.
[50:48.810 --> 50:50.470]  Is there going to be a high five or anything?
[50:50.650 --> 50:51.910]  Do you think Dairy Queen is still open here?
[50:53.370 --> 50:54.570]  Uh, yeah.
[50:54.750 --> 50:55.550]  If not, Sonic is.
[50:55.690 --> 50:56.010]  Whoa!
[50:56.170 --> 51:07.090]  The guy looks like he's got a State Farm shirt on.
[51:07.450 --> 51:08.070]  He does.
[51:10.270 --> 51:11.730]  He also was moving quickly,
[51:11.950 --> 51:14.030]  so it's like he was leaving the scene of a crime.
[51:19.190 --> 51:20.630]  Do you ever think that, like,
[51:21.090 --> 51:22.070]  how many people...
[51:22.070 --> 51:24.350]  So we're going to do this for roughly two hours
[51:24.350 --> 51:25.330]  tonight on a Saturday night.
[51:25.450 --> 51:28.170]  How many people do you think we've seen cross-bias?
[51:29.370 --> 51:30.890]  Or will have seen cross-bias
[51:30.890 --> 51:31.630]  by the time we're all done?
[51:32.010 --> 51:32.970]  I don't know.
[51:33.170 --> 51:35.050]  Oh, hang on.
[51:35.110 --> 51:37.430]  What is this guy wearing?
[51:38.770 --> 51:40.430]  That's formal attire!
[51:41.370 --> 51:41.830]  No, it's not.
[51:41.830 --> 51:42.630]  No, it's not.
[51:43.370 --> 51:44.910]  That's a tuxedo, man!
[51:45.090 --> 51:45.890]  No, it's not.
[51:46.230 --> 51:48.890]  That guy's wearing no shirt underneath.
[51:48.890 --> 51:50.750]  It's a taggy tuxedo,
[51:50.950 --> 51:53.310]  but the guy in the white has a tuxedo jacket on.
[51:53.330 --> 51:54.050]  It's shady!
[51:54.490 --> 51:57.350]  He's come straight from the music video of the Dusk Boys.
[51:57.950 --> 51:58.270]  Yes.
[51:58.590 --> 52:01.030]  Where he walked a red carpet in his tuxedo.
[52:02.530 --> 52:04.050]  Is she formal, though?
[52:04.570 --> 52:06.650]  Hang on. We have to have a look.
[52:10.100 --> 52:11.320]  I think they're all formal.
[52:11.880 --> 52:13.800]  I don't agree with that at all.
[52:17.100 --> 52:17.620]  Uh...
[52:17.620 --> 52:19.760]  She could be.
[52:19.960 --> 52:20.860]  Hang on.
[52:21.400 --> 52:22.420]  Don't jump the gun.
[52:22.720 --> 52:24.180]  It's too tacky for formal.
[52:24.420 --> 52:26.000]  That's exactly what I'm thinking.
[52:26.240 --> 52:28.840]  Well, if his is too tacky for formal, then hers is.
[52:29.220 --> 52:30.680]  She's got Oakley's on.
[52:31.260 --> 52:33.300]  This is a classic regulation podcast.
[52:33.380 --> 52:35.380]  She's got a puka necklace and Oakley's on.
[52:35.460 --> 52:36.240]  That doesn't count.
[52:36.480 --> 52:37.920]  Okay, there you go. No formal attire.
[52:38.120 --> 52:40.400]  New category going forward.
[52:41.740 --> 52:42.620]  Wacky tacky.
[52:43.280 --> 52:44.400]  We were trying to figure it out
[52:44.400 --> 52:46.620]  and I forgot to talk us into it
[52:46.620 --> 52:48.280]  and then you just cut it under.
[52:48.440 --> 52:49.820]  No problem with that.
[52:50.220 --> 52:51.220]  Oh, she's getting comments.
[52:54.150 --> 52:55.290]  I think it was a nice comment.
[52:56.190 --> 52:57.190]  Oh, they're also pants.
[52:57.630 --> 52:58.450]  WWE champion!
[52:59.190 --> 53:00.390]  There he is!
[53:02.050 --> 53:04.410]  Who's the current WWE champion right now, Eric?
[53:04.930 --> 53:05.730]  Cody Rhodes.
[53:06.310 --> 53:07.050]  Did not look like Cody Rhodes.
[53:08.290 --> 53:08.610]  No.
[53:09.370 --> 53:10.810]  He looked more like Dusty Rhodes.
[53:14.910 --> 53:15.790]  Oh, another guy.
[53:15.990 --> 53:16.530]  American Dream.
[53:16.950 --> 53:19.270]  Yeah, none of this counts as formal.
[53:20.250 --> 53:21.970]  That lady's got a fucking cast on her.
[53:21.970 --> 53:22.710]  Whoa, Bob Ross!
[53:23.390 --> 53:24.010]  Was that the Joker?
[53:25.410 --> 53:26.470]  It might have been.
[53:27.390 --> 53:28.350]  Oh, so I was going to say,
[53:28.450 --> 53:29.850]  so would you say maybe we've seen like
[53:29.850 --> 53:31.810]  a thousand people go by by the end of the week?
[53:31.810 --> 53:32.230]  Oh, yeah.
[53:32.390 --> 53:34.070]  Maybe 3,000.
[53:34.570 --> 53:35.550]  Probably more. Yeah, it's a lot.
[53:36.410 --> 53:38.810]  That means that statistically,
[53:39.430 --> 53:39.950]  statistically,
[53:40.710 --> 53:42.770]  probably at least one of the people
[53:42.770 --> 53:45.050]  we see walk by tonight is a murderer.
[53:45.510 --> 53:46.030]  Yeah.
[53:46.410 --> 53:47.530]  Oh, wow.
[53:48.870 --> 53:49.390]  Huh.
[53:50.550 --> 53:52.910]  One of these people might have
[53:52.910 --> 53:54.410]  and might kill again.
[53:54.650 --> 53:55.030]  There he goes.
[53:57.170 --> 53:57.690]  Yeah.
[53:57.830 --> 54:00.290]  It'd be interesting if you ever walk by one of these people
[54:00.290 --> 54:02.190]  in real life that you saw.
[54:02.330 --> 54:03.230]  Like, you would never know.
[54:03.310 --> 54:04.490]  You're not going to remember it.
[54:04.490 --> 54:06.710]  But like, I wonder if any of us will ever
[54:06.710 --> 54:08.750]  pass someone we saw in a Sloppy Joe's live stream.
[54:09.030 --> 54:10.370]  Or like how close you'll get to them.
[54:10.730 --> 54:11.990]  Is the Roxbury nearby?
[54:13.130 --> 54:13.970]  No, I'm kidding.
[54:15.970 --> 54:16.530]  Thank you,
[54:16.590 --> 54:17.610]  I was trying to think of that forever.
[54:17.650 --> 54:18.970]  What events are happening around there?
[54:22.890 --> 54:24.310]  I hear Chris Kattan's in town.
[54:25.770 --> 54:26.890]  The Puka shell necklace
[54:26.890 --> 54:27.690]  is really something.
[54:28.190 --> 54:31.110]  Didn't Chris Kattan break his neck or something on SNL?
[54:31.730 --> 54:32.090]  Really?
[54:32.090 --> 54:33.450]  I thought so, but I don't remember.
[54:33.970 --> 54:35.670]  Dude, he's a weird guy.
[54:35.790 --> 54:38.210]  I saw him on Celebrity Big Brother
[54:38.210 --> 54:40.010]  and he was out there.
[54:46.000 --> 54:46.400]  Whoa.
[54:46.780 --> 54:48.300]  That's shorts and a belt.
[54:48.880 --> 54:49.420]  What happened, Nick?
[54:49.720 --> 54:50.500]  Oh, just that.
[54:50.840 --> 54:52.480]  The shorts and the belt.
[54:53.260 --> 54:54.500]  Very frat feel.
[54:56.380 --> 54:58.000]  Andrew had to look up from his cake for a second.
[54:58.540 --> 54:58.960]  I did.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.720]  I feel like that would be Pink Taxi
[55:03.720 --> 55:04.600]  at one point in time, Eric.
[55:04.600 --> 55:06.480]  At one point, it would have been.
[55:06.660 --> 55:08.100]  I'm absolutely with you, Andrew.
[55:08.460 --> 55:09.340]  Looking at it...
[55:09.340 --> 55:10.320]  Where?
[55:11.760 --> 55:13.680]  That lady right there eating the ice cream.
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.240]  Never mind.
[55:16.280 --> 55:18.180]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[55:18.320 --> 55:20.200]  Never mind. From a distance, it looks nicer.
[55:20.600 --> 55:22.540]  I may not know what a luxury car is,
[55:22.680 --> 55:24.340]  but Geoff doesn't know formal attire.
[55:24.420 --> 55:25.140]  You're right.
[55:26.180 --> 55:27.280]  I rescinded it.
[55:27.640 --> 55:30.300]  Everything else on this podcast, jumping the gun,
[55:30.720 --> 55:32.520]  just trying to get something going.
[55:33.280 --> 55:33.680]  God.
[55:34.380 --> 55:34.980]  Hey, lady.
[55:36.080 --> 55:36.480]  Hi.
[55:38.840 --> 55:40.100]  Stanley Cup playoffs, huh?
[55:40.640 --> 55:40.920]  Hi.
[55:41.880 --> 55:42.640]  What do you think of that, Andrew?
[55:42.740 --> 55:43.440]  Go Canucks.
[55:44.600 --> 55:47.340]  Oh, that lady just picked her ass.
[55:47.680 --> 55:48.740]  Wow, she sure did.
[55:49.420 --> 55:50.860]  Oh, no, she's going deep.
[55:51.680 --> 55:52.420]  I already got it.
[55:54.600 --> 55:56.860]  I keep clocking in all the bald heads
[55:56.860 --> 55:58.520]  because of Gavin, and there's no point.
[55:58.860 --> 55:59.520]  Is that taken out?
[55:59.520 --> 55:59.900]  Is that a jeep?
[56:02.780 --> 56:04.100]  Is that a mean motor?
[56:04.940 --> 56:06.360]  I can't tell from behind.
[56:06.720 --> 56:07.680]  It definitely could be.
[56:08.480 --> 56:10.460]  We saw a car delivering pickup earlier, right?
[56:10.480 --> 56:11.280]  I don't want to jump the gun.
[56:12.500 --> 56:14.180]  So, have we had wedgie pull?
[56:14.180 --> 56:15.320]  Was that guy saying, wait up?
[56:15.780 --> 56:16.620]  Wait up, yeah.
[56:18.420 --> 56:20.680]  I don't think he's saying wait up, is he?
[56:21.680 --> 56:23.260]  He's waving his friends down.
[56:23.380 --> 56:24.380]  You guys are crazy.
[56:25.020 --> 56:27.400]  Just saying stuff, trying to fit your narrative.
[56:27.400 --> 56:30.000]  I really want this second place, right?
[56:30.400 --> 56:31.260]  No, I want it.
[56:31.580 --> 56:32.540]  I want that cookie.
[56:32.800 --> 56:34.520]  Is that a shopping cart?
[56:35.000 --> 56:35.800]  Oh, no, okay.
[56:36.420 --> 56:37.860]  Like a trolley.
[56:37.940 --> 56:39.760]  Should we put overstayed your welcome on there?
[56:40.840 --> 56:43.040]  That's a great one, dude.
[56:43.500 --> 56:44.560]  Geoff, please write that down.
[56:44.840 --> 56:46.320]  That is such a good one.
[56:47.040 --> 56:48.500]  Where do I write stuff now?
[56:48.620 --> 56:49.380]  Yeah, put it on my phone.
[56:50.560 --> 56:52.020]  Where do I write stuff now?
[56:53.160 --> 56:54.260]  Put it with head sheen.
[56:55.020 --> 56:55.420]  Yeah.
[56:57.040 --> 56:58.000]  Dog out too late.
[57:00.280 --> 57:02.920]  Kid out too late and dog out too late are both really good ones.
[57:05.340 --> 57:07.320]  Is that a pink taxi up there at the top?
[57:07.420 --> 57:09.480]  No, it's all white.
[57:10.260 --> 57:12.680]  You're getting into the trap I did last time we did this.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.360]  It's the lights reflecting.
[57:15.680 --> 57:16.760]  It's the red lights.
[57:17.020 --> 57:19.160]  It's the taillights from the trucks.
[57:19.340 --> 57:20.420]  Or the cars in front of them.
[57:20.920 --> 57:22.400]  Emily said we should call it move along.
[57:23.560 --> 57:24.460]  That's pretty good.
[57:24.500 --> 57:25.220]  I like that.
[57:27.020 --> 57:27.900]  I thought...
[57:27.900 --> 57:28.580]  No.
[57:33.930 --> 57:36.930]  How are none of these men shaking any other men's hands?
[57:37.330 --> 57:38.550]  Nobody's friendly anymore.
[57:38.730 --> 57:40.010]  They're not really good friends, are they?
[57:40.030 --> 57:40.950]  If they're not shaking hands.
[57:41.790 --> 57:42.990]  Or they're not drunk.
[57:51.810 --> 57:54.630]  This guy's getting a bit Larry, this guy in the black shirt.
[57:59.010 --> 58:01.410]  I like that they got the homie with the flashy cat ears.
[58:01.510 --> 58:02.610]  That's pretty cool.
[58:04.230 --> 58:06.210]  Why did the lights just change suddenly?
[58:06.230 --> 58:07.050]  I was about to say.
[58:07.790 --> 58:09.970]  Are we about to witness an event?
[58:10.170 --> 58:10.790]  No, sorry.
[58:11.030 --> 58:13.370]  I just realized the night light on my computer turned on.
[58:13.610 --> 58:14.070]  I'm turning it off.
[58:17.550 --> 58:18.410]  I was going to say.
[58:18.990 --> 58:20.610]  What a professional presentation.
[58:21.130 --> 58:21.930]  This rocks.
[58:23.630 --> 58:24.610]  That guy hooked up.
[58:24.610 --> 58:26.490]  I just saw that too.
[58:26.490 --> 58:27.550]  He just ran away.
[58:28.350 --> 58:30.750]  All I need now, I just need dancing.
[58:31.250 --> 58:32.950]  If I got dancing, I got second place.
[58:37.770 --> 58:39.170]  Some homies over there.
[58:39.390 --> 58:40.730]  Trying to pick up on some girls.
[58:41.430 --> 58:42.550]  It's not working, dude.
[58:43.110 --> 58:43.270]  Nope.
[58:44.270 --> 58:46.070]  This night light is incredibly strong, Nick.
[58:46.070 --> 58:49.170]  I can turn it off, but I need to change what we're looking at.
[58:50.250 --> 58:51.810]  No, absolutely not.
[58:51.810 --> 58:53.590]  All right, so we're just playing on night light mode.
[58:53.710 --> 58:53.850]  Sweet.
[58:55.250 --> 58:57.770]  If anyone says, why is this orange? Nick!
[58:58.210 --> 59:00.170]  We just turned on the Breaking Bad filter.
[59:00.610 --> 59:02.070]  Yeah, we're in Mexico now.
[59:09.150 --> 59:10.870]  None of this is for real.
[59:11.010 --> 59:13.630]  Your eyes will thank me, all right?
[59:14.450 --> 59:15.890]  Thanks for working out for us, man.
[59:15.950 --> 59:16.590]  Yeah, I got you.
[59:18.130 --> 59:19.190]  Checking the wind speed.
[59:19.490 --> 59:20.110]  What's this guy doing?
[59:20.890 --> 59:21.810]  He's moving along.
[59:21.810 --> 59:22.950]  Orange whip?
[59:23.710 --> 59:25.770]  What color is that taxi at the top? Is it silver?
[59:27.790 --> 59:29.310]  Old taxis are now orange.
[59:34.410 --> 59:36.350]  This guy's hand is just pumped.
[59:37.770 --> 59:38.850]  He's so drunk.
[59:39.730 --> 59:40.630]  Aggressively drunk.
[59:42.310 --> 59:44.130]  That guy's hammered.
[59:44.170 --> 59:44.790]  Yeah, he is.
[59:45.170 --> 59:47.330]  If there was a table there, he would have flipped it.
[59:47.330 --> 59:47.930]  Yep.
[59:51.400 --> 59:52.800]  Oh, somebody said 30 minutes.
[59:53.640 --> 59:54.800]  I heard old people.
[59:59.450 --> 59:59.930]  Oh.
[01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.830]  There's some speed.
[01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.890]  It's weird seeing people walk down this street
[01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:09.790]  by themselves.
[01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.650]  Yeah.
[01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:15.530]  Oh dear, that guy almost got shoved back in.
[01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.130]  That was a tap. That was a definite shoulder like...
[01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:22.490]  Does that guy have an axe on his leg?
[01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:23.470]  Oh.
[01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.970]  Is that an axe?
[01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.750]  No, but it looked like it for a second.
[01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:29.970]  It sure does.
[01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:31.810]  It's a phone holster.
[01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:34.050]  It is with his stripe on his pants.
[01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.990]  Jesus Christ.
[01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:37.570]  It looked like a hatchet on his fucking leg.
[01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:42.450]  I thought we were about to get a different kind of live stream.
[01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:44.890]  I think we found the one.
[01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.110]  It's crime on there.
[01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:50.610]  No, crime's not on there.
[01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:50.970]  Smoke!
[01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.670]  She was doing a volcano impression.
[01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.870]  Now would you say...
[01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.290]  I'm not going to call it.
[01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:59.490]  You're going to say camera shot.
[01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:00.130]  No way.
[01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:03.510]  She wanted it to be on the camera.
[01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.590]  That's why I'm going to ask.
[01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:08.410]  This street is loaded tonight.
[01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:09.450]  She's back in it now.
[01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.970]  And it's orange.
[01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:13.670]  We're only an hour away from slop o'clock.
[01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.110]  Starting to pick up.
[01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:17.670]  Are we going to go until slop o'clock?
[01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:18.770]  Oh, more smoke!
[01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:20.730]  We should stop at slop.
[01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.110]  That's vape, right? Not smoke.
[01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:24.830]  Oh, no, it's only an hour for them.
[01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.050]  I keep forgetting where to go.
[01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.130]  The time's at the top of the screen.
[01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.170]  I'm just fucking old and tired, man.
[01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.850]  It's been a crazy couple of weeks.
[01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:37.370]  Is it me or is the screen getting oranger?
[01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:39.210]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:41.470]  It feels like we're about to witness an event.
[01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:44.210]  Like double night mode.
[01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:44.990]  Yes.
[01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.230]  Do y'all want to drive back to New Mexico?
[01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:48.170]  I can turn it back.
[01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:53.290]  But I don't want to miss my pink taxi.
[01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:54.570]  Because I know as soon as you switch it,
[01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:55.870]  I'm going to miss dancing in pink taxi.
[01:01:56.070 --> 01:02:02.660]  If you want me to change it, I can do it.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.780]  As soon as I get second place, then you can change it.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.440]  Yeah, we'll change it after this round.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.760]  Which is going to be any second now.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:11.540]  Yep.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.580]  I just need a dead parrot head and I got another one.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.640]  I can feel how close we are.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.180]  I can feel it in my bones.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.040]  Pink taxi and dancing and we're there.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:23.960]  Somebody twerk!
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.180]  Wait! No.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.180]  She started to dance a little.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.120]  I've seen a couple of those
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.840]  and it's not even worth the call.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.980]  I feel like I'm not paying close enough attention
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.640]  to man-on-man scooter scenarios.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.760]  I feel like that's where I've really dropped the ball
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.980]  on this stream.
[01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.270]  I got really excited.
[01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:52.730]  That was a man-on-man scooter for a second.
[01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:56.370]  Did nobody have a formal wedding
[01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:57.550]  just an hour ago?
[01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.170]  Right?
[01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.490]  These bouncers ain't bouncing.
[01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:09.590]  Wish they were.
[01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:14.210]  Have you ever seen a bouncer
[01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:15.750]  bounce by the definition?
[01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:17.330]  Oh, big time.
[01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:18.090]  A bunch.
[01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:20.010]  My favorite one
[01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:21.870]  one time is a lady tried to use a fake ID
[01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:23.550]  and then they gave it back to her and then she left
[01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.450]  and tried to come in again
[01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:26.790]  and the guy threw it in the street.
[01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.830]  No way! Now that's bouncing.
[01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:30.990]  Look at this guy.
[01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:33.790]  What's up, buddy?
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:35.330]  He's having a good time.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.200]  That might be a meme-maw.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:44.740]  No.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.120]  You're getting tricked by the orange.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.460]  You are, it's true.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.440]  Let me change the orange.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.400]  Let me change the orange.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.000]  No, it's fine. You said it orange, Nick.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.680]  I know you want it orange, so we're going to keep it orange.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.680]  No, I didn't say it.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.960]  It's like a ghost town.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.720]  They're all gone. It's so desolate.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.340]  She's way too lively.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.840]  I was way off.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.540]  Oh, it's that goth back.
[01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:13.130]  Somebody be shy.
[01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:19.530]  Next time it freezes, I'm changing it.
[01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:27.590]  We're like two shades away from a survivor flashback.
[01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:28.670]  Yeah, really.
[01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.610]  This is good.
[01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:32.550]  We gotta do this one time.
[01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:34.950]  We gotta do this one time and play with Gracie.
[01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:36.710]  I think Gracie would have a lot of fun.
[01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:38.870]  Has she ever sat in on one with us?
[01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:39.830]  Like when we recorded it or anything?
[01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.190]  I don't think so.
[01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:43.030]  So it'd be all new for...
[01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.790]  I think so, yeah. I think it would all be new.
[01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:49.950]  You think if we did like a 24-hour button shift
[01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:50.830]  Sloppy Joe Bingo
[01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:52.710]  where like we each take like three or four hours?
[01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:54.710]  Yeah, I mean, you guys can do that.
[01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:58.050]  I'm busy at whatever time you want to do that.
[01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:58.530]  Absolutely.
[01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.190]  I would do my shift.
[01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:03.010]  No, I'm just curious if you think we...
[01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:03.810]  I'm not saying we should do it.
[01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.310]  I'm just saying, do you think you could get a full card within...
[01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:08.110]  If you were to watch this stream for 24 hours,
[01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.670]  do all these things happen in a day?
[01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:11.830]  Yes. On average.
[01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:13.570]  Yeah. I would think so.
[01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:14.050]  Yeah.
[01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.190]  Is somebody double fisting?
[01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:19.290]  Okay, there it is.
[01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.170]  Alright, hold on. I'm gonna change it.
[01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:23.550]  Oh cool, still orange.
[01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:24.290]  Wow!
[01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:27.690]  We've avoided the apocalypse.
[01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:29.890]  Okay, let me tell you.
[01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.170]  That machine has Windows 11.
[01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:35.510]  And let me tell you a little something about Windows 11.
[01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:36.910]  It sucks. It fucking sucks.
[01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:38.850]  Windows 11 does suck, Nick.
[01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:40.510]  How is it so bad?
[01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:41.710]  It's so bad.
[01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:43.710]  I've heard it's bad.
[01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:47.390]  I've got it on my gaming PC and I freaking hate it.
[01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:49.930]  It's my gaming PC and that's why...
[01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.210]  Alright, night mode.
[01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:56.970]  It's almost as if
[01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:58.790]  the second we came back on,
[01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.190]  somebody yelled action.
[01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:01.750]  Yeah, really.
[01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.470]  That's really how it feels.
[01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:05.590]  Somebody please clip
[01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:07.110]  the show them titties bro guy.
[01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.690]  Oh, I didn't even see that.
[01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:10.230]  I didn't see that either. Was it a shirt?
[01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:13.150]  I don't know. Somebody yelled in the background
[01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.830]  show them titties bro!
[01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:16.590]  Biscuits and porn?
[01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:18.930]  Biscuits and porn is pretty good.
[01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:20.570]  That's an offensive shirt.
[01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.370]  Dude, I bet biscuits and porn is into
[01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:24.190]  high fives too.
[01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:27.250]  Oh, that guy's a high fiver.
[01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.310]  Oh, careful with those shoes, lady. Okay, you're good.
[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:34.850]  Careful.
[01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:34.910]  Careful.
[01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.770]  Alright, you're good.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.960]  I feel like it's getting sloppier. It's feeling sloppier.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.020]  Oh, definitely.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.340]  Pink fucking taxi or dancing.
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:50.720]  Give me the bingo!
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.900]  Eric, you gotta give up on this pink taxi.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:53.740]  It's never gonna happen. No!
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.180]  Formal attire. Bouncer. Bouncing.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:57.960]  Meemaw.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.320]  Camera shy. Any of those.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.580]  Is that a meemaw in the pink?
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:04.640]  No.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:04.960]  Oh.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.180]  Closer.
[01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:11.150]  Dog.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.560]  Man, there's like 10 people in that thing.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.880]  Wow, that's crazy.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.100]  Giant cowboy hat.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.840]  On the back of that thing.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.460]  Shocking lack of dead parrot heads
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.940]  this evening. Yes, I agree.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:33.820]  Oh, dog.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.820]  They scurry out when it's a little later.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.320]  I was gonna say, it feels like it's a later time thing.
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:39.880]  Yeah.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.460]  They really bloom
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.260]  in the later hours of the evening.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:46.480]  How many
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.940]  bingos we got in the chat?
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.880]  Oh, that might be...
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.040]  He's got a walker.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.700]  He's dragging me.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.420]  He's not even using it.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.560]  They're just in poor health.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.940]  There have to be so many bingos in the chat.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.400]  There's a few.
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:01.520]  Poor health.
[01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:05.970]  You really like that, Nick.
[01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:08.730]  Just the way he said it. So casual.
[01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:10.790]  Is she petting a dog
[01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:11.510]  or dropping something?
[01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:13.390]  Putting out a cigarette, maybe.
[01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:15.010]  Dropping a dog.
[01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:17.150]  Pet that dog.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.720]  Shake someone's hand.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:27.880]  Somebody twerk for the love of God.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.480]  Let's see it happen.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.320]  Come on, that guy's grabbing his dick.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.980]  Grab your dick. Keep grabbing it, buddy.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.240]  Have we had a wedgie pull yet?
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.020]  Yeah. Oh, we did?
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.040]  Yeah, we had that lady
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.680]  who had her hand way up her ass.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.200]  But I thought she was just digging for gold.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.180]  I didn't think she was pulling anything.
[01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:51.650]  Because if that was the case,
[01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:52.490]  I do have a bingo.
[01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:53.950]  Oh, stop.
[01:08:55.570 --> 01:08:57.350]  If it was specifically wedgie pull,
[01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:58.010]  then I don't know.
[01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.130]  I wasn't going to classify it as wedgie pull.
[01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:07.090]  What color is that taxi?
[01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:10.550]  It looks dark.
[01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:12.650]  Oh, these guys
[01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:13.350]  going to touch hands?
[01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:14.410]  Oh!
[01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.610]  They want to.
[01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.970]  What are they doing?
[01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.770]  They want to.
[01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:24.130]  That guy is drunk laughing.
[01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.350]  Has anyone claimed a high five?
[01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:29.370]  No.
[01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.850]  That's crazy.
[01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.030]  High fives are...
[01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:35.290]  Maybe they're not going out of style.
[01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:36.690]  Maybe people don't do them as much.
[01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:38.630]  It's like a...
[01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:41.270]  It's like a response to a post-covid world.
[01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:42.810]  Yeah. Maybe.
[01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.970]  I don't think anything that we're looking at
[01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.810]  is a response to a post-covid world.
[01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:51.270]  None of these people are vaxxed.
[01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.370]  Is that a mullet right there?
[01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:56.170]  Uh, yeah.
[01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:58.630]  I already got the mullet.
[01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:59.310]  It's hard to tell.
[01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:02.070]  Just for anyone else.
[01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.770]  Oh, is that formal?
[01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:03.770]  No.
[01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:05.190]  It's more like a costume.
[01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.270]  I wish it was.
[01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:17.970]  Have you ever seen a car accident?
[01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:19.350]  Geoff, when watching this?
[01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:20.090]  Yes, I have.
[01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.730]  Oh, that's a dead parrot head!
[01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:24.030]  Dead parrot head?
[01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.830]  100%.
[01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:29.490]  The one that just shuffled along with all the sores on his legs?
[01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:30.250]  Oh, God.
[01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:32.110]  There he is right there, up at the top.
[01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:36.050]  That's bingo number two!
[01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:37.310]  Are you shitting me?
[01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:38.970]  Andrew got a cookie?
[01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:40.910]  He got first and second place?
[01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.790]  Hell yeah.
[01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:45.190]  Get an ice cream cake and a fucking cookie.
[01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.150]  I gotta order a cookie, God damn it.
[01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.790]  Alright, let's reset the cards.
[01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:51.570]  Alright, reset to zero, everybody.
[01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:53.230]  It's 10.15.
[01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:54.950]  Everything's coming up paint in the night.
[01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:57.130]  It's 10.15...
[01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:58.010]  Florida time.
[01:10:58.190 --> 01:10:59.930]  We go till flop o'clock.
[01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:01.550]  Regenerate board!
[01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:04.350]  Oh, I like this list a lot more already.
[01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:05.350]  Alright, when do we stop?
[01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:09.650]  Okay, we're going to start in three...
[01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:10.530]  You guys all got your cards?
[01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:11.390]  Yes.
[01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.910]  Everyone in the chat ready?
[01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:15.510]  Everyone ready? Restarting now.
[01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:18.610]  Okay, here we go. Starting in three...
[01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:19.850]  Two...
[01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:21.250]  One... Bingo.
[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:23.710]  Eddie V's double fisted.
[01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:26.950]  I'm really glad that this is my second...
[01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.510]  This is the worst card I've ever gotten.
[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.310]  This is a terrible card.
[01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:32.530]  Cover band...
[01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:34.570]  Almost get hit by car...
[01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:34.830]  Oh wow.
[01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:38.210]  Ghost tour...
[01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.350]  That's a dumb hat.
[01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:41.990]  He definitely dropped his ID.
[01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.990]  Do I need that?
[01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:44.170]  I don't have that this time.
[01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.230]  That's such a bad one.
[01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.730]  I do have some.
[01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:50.850]  Okay, what else do I got?
[01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:53.150]  That's a stupid hat, right?
[01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:56.250]  Is that a dumb hat the guy has around his neck?
[01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:57.110]  Yes, that's a dumb hat.
[01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:58.730]  Alright, cool. We got a dumb hat.
[01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:00.730]  I'll take it for him.
[01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:02.110]  Did I see a cowboy hat?
[01:12:03.190 --> 01:12:03.790]  No, not yet.
[01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:08.670]  Just wait for one of the...
[01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.750]  Dude, I have pink taxi again.
[01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:18.630]  We gotta get pink taxi off this fucking board.
[01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:20.570]  I agree. That's what I said last time.
[01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:21.310]  Geoff, new note.
[01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.550]  Yeah, maybe we'll remove that one.
[01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.770]  Maybe?
[01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:28.710]  I like it for Eric, though.
[01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:32.410]  Oh, is that double fisting?
[01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.530]  She's got two drinks, right?
[01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:37.110]  Yeah, that's double fisting.
[01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:38.990]  It sure is.
[01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:40.890]  Do I have that?
[01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.030]  What if we amended it to where it just says
[01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:45.930]  this is a free space unless you're Eric.
[01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:50.950]  Only everybody but Eric's space.
[01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:53.810]  Is that a mullet?
[01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:54.610]  Is this a mullet?
[01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:55.190]  That's a mullet.
[01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:58.970]  Big time mullet.
[01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:00.610]  I don't even have mullet anymore.
[01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:01.990]  Shit, get out too late.
[01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:04.450]  Punisher shirt.
[01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:12.990]  So much going on.
[01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:14.670]  Arms up.
[01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:15.530]  Oh, is that dancing?
[01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:18.370]  That was not dancing. Get real.
[01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:19.110]  That was dancing.
[01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:21.350]  Get real. No shot.
[01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.410]  She was dancing that dick off.
[01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:24.350]  That guy was hoofing it.
[01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:26.570]  I don't know if I have it. I do.
[01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.010]  He hoofed it out of frame.
[01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:31.110]  You can have dancing.
[01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:34.170]  If you feel like you really need it, Gavin.
[01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.870]  The arms were closing in and out.
[01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:36.590]  That's dancing.
[01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:39.070]  I didn't really need it, Eric, but she was dancing.
[01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:41.670]  The hands were going in and out while she was waving someone down.
[01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:45.810]  Are you shitting me the one I'm closest to winning again
[01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:46.590]  and needs twerking?
[01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:48.730]  There's a second hook in hoofing.
[01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:50.990]  Second hook, yeah.
[01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:52.910]  Have we had cowboy hat?
[01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:53.530]  Not yet.
[01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.730]  Is that a cowboy hat that lady has back there?
[01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:57.630]  No, I don't think so.
[01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:00.930]  Oh, cigar. That's quite a red one.
[01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:02.670]  Another hug.
[01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.410]  He grabbed her ass. That guy's touching her butt.
[01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:06.530]  He's all up on her butt.
[01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:08.330]  Handshake!
[01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.810]  Handshake!
[01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:12.530]  Are you shitting me? I don't have that anymore.
[01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:14.530]  I've been waiting all night for that shit.
[01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:19.230]  Oh, someone dropped something.
[01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:20.350]  Again?
[01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.510]  Was that a dropped drink?
[01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:24.170]  No.
[01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:25.550]  Was it not?
[01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:26.470]  I don't think so.
[01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:28.230]  I believe it was just the bottle cap.
[01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:29.810]  I don't know if we can count that.
[01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:33.030]  God, Gavin, that's the fucking worst.
[01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.970]  You've been waiting so long!
[01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:38.530]  Oh, it sucks.
[01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:41.830]  Oh, is she getting bounced?
[01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.970]  No.
[01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:46.650]  They're just like, get your ID, you gotta go over there.
[01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:49.630]  That'd be so cool if she was there.
[01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:53.750]  I think I'm the worst at paying attention to what's going on in the crosswalk.
[01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.650]  I think so too.
[01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.830]  Your eyes gotta be everywhere all at once.
[01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.690]  It's rough.
[01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:01.910]  Ah, neat.
[01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:04.130]  You know what we haven't seen at all tonight?
[01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:05.190]  Pink taxi.
[01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:07.070]  That too.
[01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:09.090]  We haven't seen anybody fighting.
[01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:10.730]  No couples fights, no arguments.
[01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:11.510]  Dog.
[01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:14.050]  Dog and a hog.
[01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.030]  Hey, if you're so inclined,
[01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:23.050]  after watching this nonsense,
[01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:24.330]  maybe go check out our Patreon.
[01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:27.250]  See if you might be
[01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:29.530]  moved to subscribe or whatnot.
[01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:30.830]  Maybe not. Maybe you'll look at it and go,
[01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:31.510]  this sucks.
[01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:34.270]  And let us know in the chat if you're sick of hearing it already.
[01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.610]  That lady's got an American flag shirt on
[01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:38.230]  sideways on her back.
[01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:40.770]  Lady with the black shirt and the dog.
[01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.850]  Oh, really?
[01:15:42.150 --> 01:15:44.010]  Yeah, I don't think I have an American flag, but
[01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:45.750]  it's there for y'all.
[01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:47.670]  I don't think I have it either.
[01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:50.610]  Wow. Oh wait, yes I do.
[01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:52.570]  She's never going to turn around anyway,
[01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:53.710]  so I guess I can't verify.
[01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:56.670]  I have almost all the corners.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.100]  Oh, look, another cab.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.960]  It's the people taxi.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.280]  Trip.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:12.040]  Unlike those other taxis.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.580]  Oh, they move dogs.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.480]  Almost.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.200]  I'm locked into scooters.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.420]  I need a guy-on-guy scooter.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.680]  Yeah, I need guy-on-guy.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.060]  That's another great
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.580]  context clip.
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:35.280]  Yep.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.380]  Crosswalk cowards?
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.840]  Nah, they're just waiting.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.240]  They didn't stutter.
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:42.680]  Is that a luxury car?
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.520]  I can't tell.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.300]  I don't think so.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:49.240]  Ooh.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.220]  Turn back.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.360]  That lady looks lost.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.700]  Oh, she's waiting on that guy.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.480]  I'm like
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.000]  so dialed in right now.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:07.460]  Yeah.
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:07.600]  Yeah.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.320]  The chat informing me that that was in fact a Kia.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.240]  Could've been a high-end Kia.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.980]  Gavin doesn't drive.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:20.900]  I would drive a Kia.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.440]  Yeah, I do.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.580]  You're not driving shit.
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:25.120]  If I could, I would.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.520]  Oh, yeah, well.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.160]  The thing is, you could.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:31.980]  That's true.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.760]  Nothing's stopping you, really.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:34.680]  Well,
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:38.000]  I would actually prefer you never do at this point.
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.220]  I think it's been too long.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.160]  Or save it for a supplemental, please.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.980]  Gavin learns to drive.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.880]  It's been so long
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.520]  that if you do it, it'll go badly now.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:48.300]  Yep.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.000]  I mean, you do get worse at learning
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.540]  as you get older.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.520]  Gotta acknowledge the camera.
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.040]  Did he really? Yeah.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.540]  They sure did.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.880]  I don't think I need it.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:02.420]  Oh, I do.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:03.800]  I don't.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.500]  Now she's pissed.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.300]  That guy's confused as fuck.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.540]  Damn, he's laughing.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.740]  I just gave you directions.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.220]  I didn't put the place there.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.460]  Oh, this guy's out.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:19.300]  It makes me a drunk walk yet.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:20.840]  Oh, he's acknowledging the camera for you.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.320]  He's wobbling a little.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.080]  Who, the guy?
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.660]  He's acknowledging the camera?
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.540]  Look, he's swaying.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.860]  Get real.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.120]  Look at him, he's swaying.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.460]  Yeah, I'm there.
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:34.840]  Yeah.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.300]  He's just swagging.
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:40.360]  He's got Gabe Newell vibes.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.860]  He does. He's got that Gabe swag.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.060]  Oh, someone in the chat
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.100]  just said the same thing.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:47.000]  It's that Gabe Newell.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.660]  This doesn't seem like
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.620]  Jack stealing your joke situation, does it?
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:56.740]  We'll see what
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.820]  Jack has to say about it tomorrow.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.780]  Oh, I need to write something down.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.600]  I think there's another joke steal
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.500]  potentially that's happened.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.440]  Really?
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.460]  That's great.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.140]  That's amazing. Oh, that guy's got a matching set.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:10.640]  Isn't that formal attire?
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.940]  Find out about it on the regulation podcast.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:14.720]  Yep.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.500]  We've only recorded one so far, so you won't have to listen
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.180]  that far out.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.500]  We're really week to week on this thing.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.060]  Is a Mustang a luxury car?
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:24.580]  No.
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.460]  Like a Shelby.
[01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:34.470]  Is that matching outfits?
[01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:35.250]  That's what I was about to ask.
[01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.270]  Oh, sunglasses!
[01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:40.530]  Where am I?
[01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:43.910]  Do I even have sunglasses?
[01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:46.810]  I'm not even close on this board, dude.
[01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:47.490]  This is bad.
[01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.310]  I'm not too far off if I get go-kart,
[01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:53.750]  which is never going to happen.
[01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:54.910]  Got caught with a C?
[01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:56.050]  Yeah.
[01:19:57.810 --> 01:19:59.050]  Which sucks, because it used to be
[01:19:59.050 --> 01:20:00.690]  pretty fucking regular back in the day.
[01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:03.350]  Whoever that kid was
[01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:04.770]  at a go-kart, I guess, got grounded.
[01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:07.070]  Well, it is
[01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.570]  late, Geoff.
[01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:09.890]  Dancing?
[01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:13.110]  She's wearing
[01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.470]  curtains.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.500]  Could that be on their outfits?
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.680]  Outfit could be curtains.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:34.870]  Oh, Christ.
[01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:36.750]  Sunglasses at night again.
[01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.190]  Very cool, guy.
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:46.880]  I love this song.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.980]  Oh, ghost tour!
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.400]  Wow, a lot of ghost tours.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.300]  Awesome, needed that.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:55.700]  Yeah, that actually helps.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:56.840]  You're down.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.820]  The guy on the guy-scooter is really trapping me.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:03.700]  Yeah.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.700]  Guy-on-guy-scooter is rough,
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.780]  because you feel like you're going to see it
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.900]  all the time. Yeah, I feel like I see like six
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.260]  every stream, but this one.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.980]  Always almost it, too.
[01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:19.730]  Whoa, the outfit's here.
[01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:21.290]  Damn.
[01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:22.450]  Nice water, buddy.
[01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:24.890]  Yeah, that man's just holding a case of water.
[01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:29.670]  They call him
[01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:30.530]  Thirsty Dan.
[01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:33.170]  Oh, is someone yelling?
[01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:35.650]  Oh, hold up.
[01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.350]  I think Elmer just found
[01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:38.610]  the wascally wagon.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.870]  Is that jeans and sandals?
[01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:45.610]  Jeans and flip-flops?
[01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:51.870]  That looks like jeans and closed-toed shoes.
[01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:00.570]  Matching outfits.
[01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:02.390]  Yes!
[01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.130]  Nice, there it is.
[01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:05.770]  Oh my god, we're moving.
[01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:07.610]  Big time matching outfits, dude.
[01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:09.290]  Oh, is it my bouncing...
[01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.950]  Bouncer?
[01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:14.610]  Bouncing bouncer.
[01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:15.710]  Would be different.
[01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:17.390]  What the fuck?
[01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:20.070]  That's somebody who's playing SnowRunner.
[01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:24.850]  Oh, what about that?
[01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.910]  Tesla.
[01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:28.330]  Oh yeah, nevermind.
[01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:29.250]  How dare you.
[01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:32.950]  We're just trying to get luxury car here, buddy.
[01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:33.390]  Yeah.
[01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:37.590]  I love this crossover
[01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:38.990]  between Jon Hammond and Lube.
[01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:40.370]  Oh, I can see FaceTime
[01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:41.910]  screen on that guy.
[01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:48.750]  Is that hug?
[01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:50.130]  Is that hug with that woman and that man?
[01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:51.510]  Of course, dude.
[01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:54.070]  What is going on?
[01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.710]  That's dancing.
[01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:56.290]  See, that's dancing, Gavin.
[01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:59.170]  I hope that you guys see the difference now.
[01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:00.050]  That was dancing.
[01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:02.330]  That's pretty much what the other one did.
[01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:04.110]  Oh, there's three cops.
[01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:06.410]  Oh, fuck.
[01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:08.010]  Cops copping.
[01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:12.090]  Where's your vehicles?
[01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:13.650]  Yeah, where are the cars?
[01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:14.710]  Get back to your vehicles.
[01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:18.150]  If the cops drag someone
[01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:19.410]  from around that corner,
[01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:20.850]  is that bouncers bouncing?
[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:22.690]  Oh,
[01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:23.970]  can we get one cop copping?
[01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:26.150]  Oh, I need wheelchair.
[01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:27.390]  Where'd all the wheelchairs go?
[01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:29.070]  Yeah, what the heck, I need that too.
[01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:29.970]  Three-way hug.
[01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:32.750]  I also need a tricycle.
[01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.830]  American flag.
[01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:37.070]  Oh, yeah.
[01:23:37.410 --> 01:23:38.670]  That's the lady with the American flag.
[01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:40.250]  Oh, she came back.
[01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:41.590]  Dog's still out too late, lady.
[01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:45.490]  Oh, is that formal?
[01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:48.030]  Nah, I don't think so.
[01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.510]  Flops.
[01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:52.130]  Is this dead parrot head?
[01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:53.410]  Should we have one called
[01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:54.270]  Hurts to Walk?
[01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:57.870]  Hurts to Walk is a good one to add.
[01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:59.270]  Maybe call it a night.
[01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:00.510]  Naval gate.
[01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:01.270]  Nerd glasses.
[01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:06.150]  He walks like he was on a ship.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.980]  There's a beach goth back there.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:12.800]  Wow.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.120]  Where?
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:15.820]  That dude?
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.060]  The guy in the sandals?
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.200]  No, the dude in the black shoes, black pants,
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.920]  black shirt, black hair, black watch.
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.080]  Black coat, black shoes,
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:25.280]  black hat, Cadillac?
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.500]  The guy's a time bomb, Eric.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:30.680]  That's cool.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.600]  That was for me and you.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.020]  I think that's jeans and sandals.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:34.880]  Jeans and flip-flops.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.120]  That didn't look like... where?
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:37.820]  Where?
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.100]  They were shoes.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.060]  If we're talking about the guy I thought was a beach goth,
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.180]  he definitely had closed-toed shoes.
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:46.740]  This guy's acknowledging the camera.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.300]  What up?
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.600]  It's a shoe that looks like a sand...
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.080]  What is that?
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:53.220]  Where are you looking?
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.660]  The very right of the screen, those guy's jeans.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.160]  Those are shoes.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.300]  They're shoes.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.020]  Those are shoes, I think.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.040]  Drop something.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.380]  Big time.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.180]  They're just like...
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:08.860]  That guy right there?
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:10.540]  Cowboy hat.
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.140]  Cowboy hat.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.840]  E-fucking-ha, baby.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.960]  I thought you were calling a bingo and I got scared.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:16.560]  No, hell no.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.340]  I got five things and they're just scattered around.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:21.780]  I'm not fucking close at all.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:23.720]  Litterbug!
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:25.180]  Fuck you!
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:27.640]  Needed it.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.000]  I need a trip.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.600]  Eyes out for skateboards.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.000]  Trip would be great.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.500]  Are we playing for cake again?
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.120]  Absolutely.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:38.920]  Alright, sweet.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.920]  I can't have two cakes.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.840]  Don't worry, you won't.
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:45.660]  Dude, we got some...
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.200]  Big words coming from Big Taxi.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:51.960]  Those are my shorts.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.540]  Throw them on a car and airtap me.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:56.200]  Jeans and sandals!
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:01.980]  Do I need that?
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.100]  That dude just littered.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.200]  Almost into that bike.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  It's like he threw it at him on purpose.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.060]  Shirts tucked into shorts is interesting.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.980]  Tucked into the shorts with a belt.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.420]  That's the second one I've seen.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.420]  It's Key West, let it hang.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.840]  That's not the vibe.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:32.580]  Maybe formal shorts should be on there.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:34.080]  Formal shorts!
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.380]  Is that two guys on a scooter?
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:38.900]  No.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.020]  No, no, no.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.840]  Geoff, we're just over 10 minutes.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:43.920]  I don't even have that, I just want to see.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.140]  Just over 10 minutes.
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.680]  Left for your Celtics.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.000]  Oh shit, how's the score?
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.960]  86-75, Boston.
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:52.420]  Scoot!
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.160]  They were up, I feel like, more than that earlier.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.380]  I'm still going to watch the game.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.660]  Even if they blow them out.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:01.720]  Well, yeah, you gotta.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:02.960]  Andrew Luck?
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.540]  Holy shit, Andrew.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.780]  Oh my fucking god, dude.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.920]  That's so funny.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.880]  What a fucking pull, dude.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:15.620]  Kid, kid, kid.
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:19.260]  Dead to fucking rights, dude.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.640]  Get out too late, ladies dancing.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.280]  That was dancing.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.920]  The first one was lady dancing.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:25.940]  Big taxi!
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:27.460]  Big taxi!
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.620]  Oh my god, there it is!
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.140]  Alright, don't erase it.
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.240]  I'm so happy.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.960]  They exist.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.080]  Big time drunk walk.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.220]  Honestly?
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.760]  Those two dudes just walked by.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:43.860]  Honestly?
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.420]  You have to keep pink taxi in now.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:49.940]  The universe spoke.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.120]  Justified.
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.620]  Alright, I need...
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.940]  What do I need?
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:56.800]  Bandage, dude.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.500]  That has to be an offensive shirt.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.880]  What did it say?
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.040]  It's impossible.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.440]  It looked like an offensive life.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.420]  Is that formal?
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:09.420]  No.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.520]  I need bandage, dude.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:13.280]  Come on, man.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.860]  That guy looks like Scott the Engineer.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:16.680]  He does.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.180]  I was talking to Eric the other day, Gavin.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.940]  I was thinking about Stern and our place in Stern.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.880]  And how we all fit into the slots.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.660]  And I never accounted for Nick before.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.240]  American Flag.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.460]  And I realized, Gavin,
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.500]  that if we directly translate it,
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.680]  Nick is Scott the Engineer.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.000]  Poor Nick probably has no idea why.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.020]  That's not cool.
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:39.720]  No, I don't know.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:40.740]  I want to know.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.900]  Let's see how your push-ups are.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.880]  Now that could be...
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:50.320]  It's form-fitting.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:51.340]  Yeah.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.300]  Formal attire.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.580]  This dress coming up?
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.000]  No, she was walking away.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.940]  Walking, walking,
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.140]  walking away.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:05.820]  Bunny ears, beard?
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.200]  I thought we were cat ears.
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.120]  I thought it was a mixed family.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.080]  I was looking up Scott the Engineer
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.960]  just to see where his social media and everything.
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.520]  He's at Scott the Engineer on Instagram.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.200]  Do you know what his Twitter name is?
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:21.840]  Oh, God.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.260]  Oh, no.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.120]  It's not Scott the Engineer.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.120]  It's at Scott the Bowler.
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.680]  Oh, damn it.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.980]  I was trying to figure out how he would phrase bowling.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.460]  Scott the Bowler.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:36.580]  What a fucking dork.
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:38.300]  What a fucking dork.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.080]  If that just isn't him all the way, man.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.180]  Black Cloud.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:44.440]  Yep.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.360]  How does it feel, Nick, to be associated with this guy
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.080]  and then hear that?
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.380]  A guy whose entire family
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:52.280]  has a black cloud over their head.
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.100]  Whose mother sat him down
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.160]  when he was young and told him never to try in life
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.920]  because the black cloud would take any
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.200]  good thing away from them.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:01.840]  I'm sorry, Nick.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.620]  My mother would never tell me that.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.660]  If anything, she's too proud.
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:07.260]  Oh.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:08.680]  See, that's dancing.
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:10.740]  I hope you guys see the difference.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:11.400]  That's twerking.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.580]  Not really.
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:13.820]  I wish.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.600]  Well, I wished earlier, yeah.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.040]  Gavin, any other luxury
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:23.880]  cars you want to call out?
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.200]  What about that one?
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.480]  Now I'm a little bit scared.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.580]  That's another good one, Andrew.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:31.520]  It's the dog car!
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.980]  Somebody trip, though.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:36.600]  Seriously.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.100]  I need trip also.
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:40.020]  I need a skateboard.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.460]  Skateboard's not bad.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:43.940]  Can you hear Andrew?
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.560]  No.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.280]  Andrew?
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:47.280]  What do you mean?
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:50.380]  I think he just hasn't been talking.
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.820]  He's still looking at the cake.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.780]  I was quietly dropping things.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:56.420]  Geoff just heard me.
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:57.540]  What?
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.300]  Can anybody hear Andrew?
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:01.460]  Who?
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.560]  Because I'm focusing on Latte Da.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.880]  Uh-huh.
[01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:16.850]  We have over 2,000 people
[01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:18.070]  watching this with us right now.
[01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.830]  That's fucking crazy.
[01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:19.930]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:23.410]  Is that a trike, by the way?
[01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.930]  Yeah, it was.
[01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:27.630]  Pretty common, so I would assume so.
[01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:30.250]  All I need for a bingo is puking
[01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:31.890]  on the ground or in a trash can.
[01:31:32.110 --> 01:31:34.510]  It's 10.30. No fucking shot.
[01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:35.970]  Where else could you puke?
[01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:37.010]  Why not just say puke?
[01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:40.050]  I think specifically because the first
[01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:41.750]  couple times I saw somebody puke, it was in that
[01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:43.770]  trash can and I rode it and then I was like, I should have
[01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:45.010]  meant it to just say anywhere.
[01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:47.090]  I guess you could puke on your friend.
[01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:48.550]  Oh, is that Model Y?
[01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:49.170]  What is that?
[01:31:50.410 --> 01:31:51.830]  I don't know. Is that a luxury car?
[01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:54.230]  It's a good sheen.
[01:31:56.890 --> 01:31:57.950]  The X and S
[01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:59.330]  are luxury cars, I think.
[01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:01.270]  The Xbox X and S?
[01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:03.350]  Hey, is that guy tall enough for anybody to be excited?
[01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:06.390]  He's on the cusp.
[01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:08.070]  Oh, rental scooters!
[01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:10.250]  Those are definitely some rental scooters.
[01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:11.990]  They should have doubled up.
[01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.910]  One more guy!
[01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:14.810]  We don't know what's on that back scooter.
[01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:17.410]  Oh, that's guy-on-guy-scooter back there.
[01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:18.750]  It's gotta be. Is it?
[01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:20.530]  Is it?
[01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:22.430]  Come on!
[01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:25.170]  We should add the lost and damned.
[01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.910]  Damn.
[01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:28.710]  No, I don't think it was.
[01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:31.770]  There's a kid out there.
[01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:33.530]  No guy-on-guy-scooter. Damn.
[01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:33.970]  No.
[01:32:33.970 --> 01:32:34.030]  No.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.260]  Someone go and put on a suit.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:46.920]  Meemaw?
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.780]  He thought about it, but no.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.160]  Get out too late.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.120]  Way too late.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:56.920]  Put that kid to bed.
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:00.640]  Little kids want to be sleeping and dreaming
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:01.600]  about cool stuff.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:04.700]  The chat was saying there was a guy-on-guy-scooter,
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.700]  but it was a foot scooter. I didn't see anything
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:07.100]  like that.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.680]  How did I miss that?
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.460]  I didn't see it at all.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.720]  I didn't see it. Did you guys see it?
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:14.900]  I think a foot scooter would count.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.940]  It would count like that.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.140]  Yeah, I think it has a scooter.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.300]  It does, but I didn't
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.260]  see it. How do you fit in two guys
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:24.180]  on one of those?
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:25.780]  People be fitting.
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.880]  You got me there.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.560]  I've heard it said.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:32.900]  Somebody
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.120]  clipped it for us. Thank you.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:35.340]  Thank you.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:37.640]  I'd love to see that.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.860]  This is great. It's great on Twitch.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.080]  Oh, they were going
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.200]  the other way. We were so
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.040]  fucking focused on the lost
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.100]  and the damned guys.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.340]  Two guys on the scooter going the other
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.220]  way. So can we have it
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.480]  or not? Yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.600]  No, we didn't see it. Why not?
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:59.000]  None of us saw it.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.600]  The chat's helping us out.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.960]  You know, Eric, in a game
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.940]  where they miss a call
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.560]  but they show the replay of it.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.580]  That's VAR right there. Honestly,
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.680]  that was VAR. To me, that's VAR.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.120]  No, but it's like they didn't call it.
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:15.820]  That's like a penalty and you can't overturn it.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.260]  It's not a reveal.
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:19.780]  Thank you. That is exactly
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.560]  what I was trying to say. What if
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.820]  we get one reviewable
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.480]  play per stream?
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.760]  Oh, there's an interesting idea.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:29.520]  One challenge flag?
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.580]  Yeah, one challenge and then we have to
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.460]  go on a chat clip.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.700]  But what if we get one right
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.720]  and then we get an opportunity for a second
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.060]  one?
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.280]  But only if we get the first one right.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.680]  It's so complicated.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.800]  Alright, alright. I like the idea of a challenge
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:46.620]  though. Yeah, come on, guys.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:47.880]  Don't complicate it.
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.420]  That's a guy on a scooter.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.120]  Those two dudes doing donuts?
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:54.060]  Dude.
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.620]  Don't complicate it. Geoff hates
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:59.560]  when it gets complicated. I'm a cop car away from
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.100]  another bingo.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:03.740]  Oh, shit.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:05.380]  They are definitely dudes.
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.980]  They almost got hit by a car.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.300]  That's awesome.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.000]  Oh, no. Nick!
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:12.980]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:15.520]  People are saying there's a luxury car and we're missing it.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.480]  Oh, are you serious?
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.340]  Where's the luxury car?
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.560]  They said Porsche. I didn't see it. Did you?
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:23.240]  Oh, the cops.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.480]  Why won't you
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.940]  come by with your car?
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:29.500]  What if
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.260]  they were walking with saying, Nino, Nino?
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.640]  One of them just holding the light
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.380]  as it's flipping.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.740]  That guy? This guy looks like a pirate.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.660]  Luxury Toyota
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:42.200]  Sienna.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:47.240]  That lady's
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.400]  hooking it hard, dude. Look at her go up top left.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.600]  Oh, she's rocking it.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:53.460]  And it is bare feet.
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:55.360]  It is crock town tonight.
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.520]  Another guy on guy, maybe?
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.080]  Oh, hug. There's a hug.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:35:59.900]  That's a hug.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.740]  Anyone got hug?
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.780]  It's on there. We got it.
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:07.080]  I just need a skateboard.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:07.860]  Come on.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.900]  Is that a guy on guy's car again?
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:11.940]  I need bandage.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:15.480]  No, that's him and his wife.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.800]  Come on, bandage, dude.
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.460]  That's some guy and his stupid wife.
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:19.360]  Another guy on guy.
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:21.680]  Take your shoes off.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.580]  Drop your drink.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.020]  Trip on the drink.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.300]  Into a skateboard.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.500]  Made fun of by a guy in a go-kart.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.040]  His chant isn't very good.
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.800]  No, it really went off the rails.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.140]  Yeah, it got out of control.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.260]  Satan's vehicle!
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:42.380]  Call the police!
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:51.080]  For real, though.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.860]  Somebody roll up with a bandage.
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.100]  Does anybody have a staph infection?
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.400]  Oh, God.
[01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:01.330]  Oh, man.
[01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:05.210]  Hey, so this is our career, huh?
[01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:07.270]  Yeah.
[01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:11.010]  Huh.
[01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.230]  When you put it that way.
[01:37:14.190 --> 01:37:15.650]  Thank you so much for all the people
[01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:16.630]  that have shown up today.
[01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:19.310]  It's been so much fun.
[01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:21.130]  Thanks for coming to Saturday with us.
[01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.470]  Yeah.
[01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:24.610]  Thanks for allowing this to be a career.
[01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:25.670]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:30.710]  Now I just need to see someone puke.
[01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:32.910]  If any of you are in the Key West area
[01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:34.610]  and have a...
[01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:35.210]  Skateboard.
[01:37:35.970 --> 01:37:36.450]  Bandage.
[01:37:38.530 --> 01:37:39.530]  It wouldn't mind.
[01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:42.270]  Yeah, if you happen to have a fire truck and are in the area,
[01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.050]  feel free.
[01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:45.790]  Swing on by.
[01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:47.690]  Man, these people are going
[01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:49.670]  straight through a four-way stop on scooters.
[01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:51.910]  I feel like we've entered slow motion.
[01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:53.690]  I feel like everyone is going slow.
[01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:56.410]  Are you dropping frames?
[01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:58.030]  No, it's just
[01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:59.350]  no one's moving fast.
[01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:01.910]  It's crazy how this place...
[01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:02.830]  We talked about it before.
[01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:05.570]  It's so packed and jammed and fucked
[01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:07.750]  and then all of a sudden, no one's on the street.
[01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.910]  It's so crazy.
[01:38:12.370 --> 01:38:13.570]  Yeah, it's like little swarms.
[01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:14.330]  Yeah.
[01:38:16.210 --> 01:38:17.130]  Is that formal?
[01:38:17.650 --> 01:38:18.090]  No.
[01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:19.970]  Closer, though.
[01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:21.910]  Is that a luxury car?
[01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:23.090]  That has to be.
[01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:26.830]  You know what? We're calling it a luxury car.
[01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:27.290]  Wow.
[01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:29.990]  It's a little yellow thing.
[01:38:30.450 --> 01:38:31.830]  It's a little yellow thing.
[01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:32.410]  It counts.
[01:38:39.190 --> 01:38:40.830]  How much time do we have
[01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:42.010]  until we have to get a bingo?
[01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:44.130]  Oh, is she leaving that there?
[01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:45.550]  Wow. Litter bug.
[01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:47.910]  What a litter bug.
[01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:50.190]  I mean, we can go
[01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.570]  another half an hour.
[01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:53.930]  We want to go until at least Slop O'Clock, right?
[01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:55.330]  We want to go to Slop O'Clock.
[01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:55.890]  Yeah.
[01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:59.590]  It's like we said with Red vs. Blue.
[01:38:59.910 --> 01:39:02.390]  We'll keep going on Sloppy Joe's
[01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:03.910]  bingo until you stop watching
[01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:05.870]  or 21 years, whichever comes first.
[01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:09.070]  What?
[01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:10.750]  That might be a meemaw.
[01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:14.150]  Oh, the way she's walking?
[01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:15.690]  I mean, that's definitely a hurt to walk.
[01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:17.090]  Oh, yeah, that might be a meemaw.
[01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:17.990]  I'll take that.
[01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:20.670]  I don't have it, but if anybody does...
[01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:22.190]  I need yawning or puking.
[01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:24.170]  There's another pink fucking taxi!
[01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:27.750]  I need bare feet.
[01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:29.250]  I need sitting on the street.
[01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.850]  Yawning, puking.
[01:39:32.650 --> 01:39:33.950]  That's a real double play
[01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:34.510]  I feel like you get Gavin.
[01:39:35.190 --> 01:39:36.730]  I feel like those go hand in hand.
[01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:38.330]  What the hell is she doing?
[01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:39.850]  Sitting on the street with the shoes off.
[01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:40.790]  I thought it was a hammer.
[01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:43.350]  I thought it was a toilet plunger for a second.
[01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:44.670]  Or a clog tube.
[01:39:51.970 --> 01:39:54.270]  Uh oh, careful what you show on your phone there, lady.
[01:39:57.210 --> 01:39:58.290]  But do take a selfie.
[01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.910]  Sharkback.
[01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:07.430]  Sharkback.
[01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.790]  Sharkback.
[01:40:09.730 --> 01:40:11.990]  That guy's been to every beach in Texas.
[01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:13.310]  Because they sell those everywhere.
[01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:15.310]  Sharkbag.
[01:40:21.970 --> 01:40:25.510]  We could do crossbody purse, but we'd mark it off immediately.
[01:40:26.670 --> 01:40:28.710]  Is there a fanny pack for each square?
[01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:29.530]  Nah.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.820]  We should do fucking stupid light up hat though.
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:39.560]  Light up head?
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.860]  But I feel like that's just been tonight.
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:44.280]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.060]  Could be the new thing.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.940]  Nah, I think it...
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.800]  We gotta at least see it on another stream.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:51.540]  That's true.
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.940]  You need multiple streams for an independent confirmation.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.900]  Is there a clown car?
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:58.840]  You know, like an overloaded vehicle.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.200]  Clown car's a good one.
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:04.900]  Like one of those overloaded carts
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.560]  where it's like, Gavin pointed it out earlier
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.120]  and he's like, that's a lot of fucking people.
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:08.300]  Trip.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:08.580]  Trip.
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:11.180]  Puke.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:11.680]  Puke.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.200]  Skate.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.160]  Fall down.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.220]  Specifically on the floor in a bin.
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.780]  That guy looked horrified.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.580]  Yeah, that was shy.
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.960]  If you guys are looking for kids.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.620]  He looked terrified to be honest.
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.680]  I wouldn't say that was shy, but he did look scared.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.560]  I also would not say that was shy.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:33.400]  He was scared.
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:36.140]  I don't care, but I don't have it either way.
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:37.580]  I don't either, so it doesn't help me.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.040]  He looked pretty fucking terrified to me.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.520]  That guy looks like the scientist in a movie who's been forced to do the bad thing.
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:48.140]  Pretty good.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.480]  They're gonna kill his kids.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:52.480]  Oh no.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:53.880]  He had to.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  Puke or yawn.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:00.680]  Messy jersey.
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:02.620]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.510]  Trip.
[01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:10.330]  No.
[01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:11.250]  Damn.
[01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:12.050]  No.
[01:42:15.230 --> 01:42:15.750]  Dude.
[01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:21.950]  The walking around unlit cigarette in the mouth is such a thing you don't see so much anymore.
[01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:23.070]  He's struggling.
[01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:24.550]  Come on bud, you got it.
[01:42:24.810 --> 01:42:25.910]  Come on bud.
[01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:28.150]  Did he get it?
[01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:29.830]  I don't think he got it.
[01:42:31.170 --> 01:42:32.190]  Come on bud.
[01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:33.750]  Put the hand in front fool.
[01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:37.490]  No, because now he's going to tip his drink onto it.
[01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:39.050]  He got it.
[01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:39.710]  He got it.
[01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:41.010]  Oh, look at him.
[01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:43.190]  Smoker's first puff in the morning.
[01:42:44.110 --> 01:42:45.850]  I've met so many of that guy.
[01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:47.210]  No kidding.
[01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:50.730]  Is that Dave Attell?
[01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:52.690]  They're all 80s.
[01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:00.550]  The thing I like about that hat that he has on.
[01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:02.810]  He looks like he's a gust away from flying.
[01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:03.350]  This guy wearing.
[01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:05.810]  He's like a gust from going back two blocks.
[01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:10.750]  Oh, he guzzed in the street.
[01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:13.030]  He's got the Greg Norman on.
[01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:16.710]  We're just sticking with golf references tonight.
[01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:18.210]  I like it.
[01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:21.410]  Is he going to face ID?
[01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:22.450]  Or is he going to go for a pass?
[01:43:24.110 --> 01:43:24.790]  He's slammed.
[01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.730]  Uh oh.
[01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:29.370]  So somebody who's never been here.
[01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:31.330]  What is the guy with the hat doing?
[01:43:32.150 --> 01:43:34.070]  He's snacking on something it looks like.
[01:43:34.290 --> 01:43:35.150]  You think it's intent?
[01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.790]  I don't think it's intent.
[01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:39.110]  Is his intent to go into Sloppy Joe's at some point?
[01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:41.810]  Is that the Beach Goth?
[01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:43.010]  No.
[01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:45.850]  Was that formal attire? That black dress?
[01:43:46.190 --> 01:43:46.610]  No.
[01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:50.230]  I think he might go into Sloppy Joe's.
[01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:52.630]  But also if he doesn't, I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:53.130]  You know what I mean?
[01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:57.770]  Wow, big surprise. These two are homies.
[01:43:58.170 --> 01:44:00.270]  He might just be playing bingo.
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:04.030]  Now is Kenny Chesney part of this double that we have?
[01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:05.650]  You're right.
[01:44:05.730 --> 01:44:07.110]  He's talking awfully close.
[01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:10.630]  He almost smoked the other end of the cigarette.
[01:44:11.490 --> 01:44:12.570]  They ran this dude off.
[01:44:12.670 --> 01:44:13.670]  He was like, that's too close to me.
[01:44:14.010 --> 01:44:15.710]  Yeah, they're going to lady in the trampit.
[01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:17.710]  The cigarette?
[01:44:18.090 --> 01:44:18.250]  Yeah.
[01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:20.630]  You just light the middle?
[01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:24.510]  That's awful.
[01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:27.310]  That'd be disgusting.
[01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:32.930]  What is smoking an unfiltered side of the cigarette?
[01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:36.690]  Oh, you drew the short straw.
[01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:43.210]  Are you using a filtered side?
[01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:43.810]  Pussy.
[01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:48.450]  Do they make any long cigarettes with filters at both ends?
[01:44:48.630 --> 01:44:49.190]  Just for that part.
[01:44:50.710 --> 01:44:52.750]  Because that sounds like Uniform all over.
[01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:56.390]  We're not selling cigarettes at Uniform.
[01:44:57.810 --> 01:45:01.310]  What if Uniform sold cigarettes that were only filters?
[01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:05.530]  No nicotine to worry about.
[01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:08.870]  100% filter.
[01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.650]  Litter.
[01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:19.770]  God, that'd be such a move if the first thing we sold was cigarettes.
[01:45:20.290 --> 01:45:21.950]  We're not selling cigarettes.
[01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:26.390]  We had to fill out government documents that said we don't sell cigarettes.
[01:45:26.590 --> 01:45:27.490]  Is that true?
[01:45:28.090 --> 01:45:28.670]  Yes.
[01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:30.530]  What else can't we sell?
[01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:33.810]  Tobacco, firearms, and alcohol.
[01:45:35.130 --> 01:45:37.130]  So many good ideas out the window.
[01:45:38.610 --> 01:45:40.930]  What about a double-sided vape?
[01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:43.430]  My gun that shoots cigarettes is out.
[01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:50.790]  But it shoots a cigarette with a filter on both sides that you have to light in the middle.
[01:45:51.090 --> 01:45:52.130]  Let's have it silenced.
[01:45:52.730 --> 01:45:53.890]  It's a two-player cigarette.
[01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:55.890]  My firework cigarette lighter.
[01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:56.490]  Get out too late.
[01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:57.910]  Oh, get out way too late.
[01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:01.110]  I think I have headphones.
[01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:04.010]  That's formal attire, right?
[01:46:04.590 --> 01:46:04.730]  Where?
[01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:06.790]  That lady in the purple thing at the bottom.
[01:46:06.930 --> 01:46:09.110]  She had fancy shoes and a fancy purse.
[01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:10.170]  No way.
[01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:11.670]  You didn't think that was formal attire?
[01:46:11.670 --> 01:46:14.570]  I don't even have formal attire.
[01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:15.130]  Oh, I do.
[01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:15.870]  Are we watching?
[01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:19.810]  Let the chat say.
[01:46:22.810 --> 01:46:24.670]  Why? We're not going to accept it.
[01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:25.630]  I'm just curious.
[01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:28.130]  Another pink taxi.
[01:46:28.130 --> 01:46:29.830]  A drunk walk.
[01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:31.870]  Dude, there's been three fucking pink taxis on this thing.
[01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:32.210]  Chugging it!
[01:46:33.570 --> 01:46:34.990]  She definitely chugged that.
[01:46:35.190 --> 01:46:35.530]  Did she?
[01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:39.410]  It's a pretty dickhead truck right here.
[01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:40.250]  Wow.
[01:46:41.050 --> 01:46:44.470]  I need car delivery slash pickup.
[01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:46.530]  Have I missed a billion of those?
[01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:53.270]  Honestly, where they happen a lot is up at the top where that car's waiting and going right now.
[01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:55.430]  There's been a lot up there.
[01:46:55.810 --> 01:46:57.970]  That would give me a bingo, as would formal attire.
[01:46:57.970 --> 01:46:58.770]  Oh shit.
[01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:01.570]  What were you asking, Andrew?
[01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:05.510]  I was going to say, do you know if there's still the camera in Sloppy Joe's that does the spin?
[01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:07.690]  I believe so. I think it's on their website.
[01:47:08.110 --> 01:47:14.870]  Maybe we do something at some point where we do duos in Sloppy Joe's and half of us are assigned to the inside and half on the outside.
[01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:16.290]  That's interesting.
[01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:20.110]  So here's the thing. That's a great idea in theory.
[01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:25.710]  Until we do it and half of the conversation is about stuff the other half of the people can't see.
[01:47:27.810 --> 01:47:29.990]  It would have to be two streams.
[01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.790]  Okay.
[01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:34.810]  Does YouTube offer the option still to switch between cameras?
[01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:37.130]  I don't know.
[01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:39.010]  There's that dog again.
[01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:40.810]  Love that dog.
[01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:45.970]  Dickhead Truck.
[01:47:48.110 --> 01:47:49.150]  Jesus Christ.
[01:47:49.570 --> 01:47:51.510]  Is Dickhead Truck on the Bingo Burger?
[01:47:51.530 --> 01:47:52.490]  No, it hasn't been added yet.
[01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:53.410]  It needs to be.
[01:47:55.190 --> 01:47:56.530]  Dickhead Tiny Dick Truck.
[01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:58.510]  He didn't yell wait up.
[01:47:59.110 --> 01:47:59.670]  Nevermind.
[01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:01.930]  Oh!
[01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:03.870]  It's a hug!
[01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:06.310]  I thought it was going to be a high five.
[01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:07.670]  It was huffing and a hug.
[01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:11.310]  Handshake!
[01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.990]  Wow!
[01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:15.910]  No high five though.
[01:48:16.190 --> 01:48:17.290]  Let's see it up top.
[01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:20.850]  Why is everybody so healthy?
[01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:25.950]  Doesn't anybody fall or bump into shit?
[01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:29.250]  Scooter cowards, where's your skateboard?
[01:48:29.530 --> 01:48:31.750]  Maybe foreign security should be on there.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.200]  Man, it is not a formal Saturday.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.660]  Take a fucking selfie.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:41.240]  No.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.920]  This is my favorite Green Day song playing right now.
[01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:52.110]  Aggressive honking.
[01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:54.510]  I don't have that anymore.
[01:48:54.670 --> 01:48:55.390]  Son of a bitch.
[01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:58.070]  All I need is trip, formal attire, and a skateboard.
[01:48:58.330 --> 01:48:58.410]  Cop car?
[01:48:58.630 --> 01:48:59.170]  Is that a cop car?
[01:49:00.650 --> 01:49:01.370]  Good try.
[01:49:02.770 --> 01:49:04.250]  Repurposed cop car, not a cop car.
[01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:07.050]  I think Nick said good try.
[01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:08.790]  Like I was trying to pull one over on all of you.
[01:49:10.450 --> 01:49:11.850]  Yeah, the thing that Andrew
[01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:13.510]  classically doesn't do.
[01:49:14.230 --> 01:49:15.350]  Well, I was asking.
[01:49:15.490 --> 01:49:16.330]  That wasn't a declaration.
[01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:19.570]  You see half that car, you think that's a cop car.
[01:49:19.690 --> 01:49:20.390]  I feel like I'm in the right.
[01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:21.030]  Hi, hi.
[01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.110]  Hi.
[01:49:21.570 --> 01:49:22.010]  Hi.
[01:49:25.730 --> 01:49:27.330]  That's crazy, we're on a camera.
[01:49:27.630 --> 01:49:28.430]  Have y'all heard about our picture?
[01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.930]  We've all been there.
[01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.790]  100%.
[01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:34.930]  Dude, I got so fucking nervous in front of this thing.
[01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:36.530]  This guy is too drunk.
[01:49:37.810 --> 01:49:39.170]  I got tripped by a woman.
[01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:41.450]  I like...
[01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:42.230]  She was small too.
[01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:45.130]  I like whenever we make fun of somebody who's
[01:49:45.130 --> 01:49:47.070]  captivated by the camera as we watch the
[01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:48.630]  camera for two consecutive hours.
[01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:49.330]  Yeah.
[01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:52.430]  As we're glued to the camera.
[01:49:53.690 --> 01:49:55.330]  On a Saturday night.
[01:49:56.710 --> 01:49:57.730]  Okay, alright.
[01:49:58.110 --> 01:50:00.390]  In my fucking pajamas in my office.
[01:50:01.730 --> 01:50:04.290]  Watching a grown man stretch
[01:50:04.290 --> 01:50:06.150]  his quad out.
[01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:07.930]  I was really worried where you were.
[01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:12.190]  I was going to say hammy or quad.
[01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:15.630]  Get out of this car.
[01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:16.210]  Ugh.
[01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:24.010]  Just a fire truck just driving by.
[01:50:24.810 --> 01:50:25.990]  Puke, yawn.
[01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:27.630]  Puke, yawn.
[01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:29.370]  Trip, skateboard.
[01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:30.210]  Trip, skateboard.
[01:50:31.190 --> 01:50:32.630]  Formal attire. Fall.
[01:50:33.230 --> 01:50:34.270]  Trip, slip.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:39.860]  Selfie.
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:41.820]  That lady's taking a selfie.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.380]  That's not a selfie, she's taking a picture.
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:45.620]  A selfie could be a picture.
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:47.960]  How do you know it's a selfie?
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.580]  How do you know it's not?
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:51.480]  She's taking a picture of herself.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.680]  So how can you tell?
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.880]  Her arm isn't in selfie position.
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:55.820]  It would have been further away.
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:59.340]  Jumping the gun again.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:01.220]  I don't think people use two hands
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:02.160]  for a selfie typically.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:04.580]  Older people do.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.400]  Socks and sandals.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.000]  Oof.
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.960]  Come on older guys, what are you yawning?
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:22.080]  You're tired, when are you tired?
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:24.760]  Just one skateboard.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:26.860]  Oh, a little bit of dancing.
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:29.260]  These guys look like
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:30.600]  they're about to hit the golf course tomorrow.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:31.700]  Oh, is that beach golf?
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:33.220]  That guy's got an Ed Hardy shirt.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:35.580]  That's offensive.
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:38.340]  Holy shit. Wow.
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:40.160]  That's crazy.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:43.040]  Do you think he just held onto it all this time?
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:44.960]  There was a time in my life
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.300]  where I thought Ed Hardy was part of the Hardy Boys.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:48.520]  That's awesome.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.240]  I'm impressed.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:52.940]  He was the flamboyant Hardy.
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:55.340]  Dickhead truck.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.000]  Dickhead truck.
[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.360]  It's not as dickhead as the other one.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:05.140]  Wait, is that the fake cop car again?
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:05.880]  Yeah.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.100]  They're cruising.
[01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:13.320]  That guy's trained on video games.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:20.800]  That was so close again.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:22.440]  Fucking bandage, dude.
[01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:24.560]  They were everywhere earlier.
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.600]  It was like they were handing out
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:27.980]  free casts on the street.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:39.520]  No law of action right now.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:40.880]  No, boys.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.740]  Well, it's not quite slop o'clock yet.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:44.100]  We're getting close.
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:49.120]  Getting real close.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.060]  Alright, I feel it.
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:54.920]  It's actually about to happen for us.
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.080]  That guy looked like he was wearing a beard
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.180]  instead of growing one.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.820]  Maybe he's in witness protection.
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.340]  Was that Garrett from Mega64?
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:13.360]  This would be the last place
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.600]  I would expect to see him.
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.200]  He probably would have said the same thing about you.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.480]  It's true.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.160]  You know what? That's true.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:23.480]  He's one of the few people I've ever met
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.800]  who I've road tripped with.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:26.740]  Really? Yeah, that's right.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:27.580]  Oh, wow.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.740]  He's great. He's a great road trip guy.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.420]  He just puts on stern and it's like,
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.300]  let's go. It's great.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:34.800]  Oh, that's a great road trip.
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:35.700]  Yeah.
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:39.320]  Interesting that you would say that, Scott.
[01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:40.420]  No!
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:42.800]  Try school.
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.140]  Oh, get out.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:46.840]  Unload.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:48.760]  Damn it.
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.540]  Oh, it felt like they were going to, dude.
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:53.440]  It did, for sure.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.600]  Wow. So sorry.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:58.760]  Andrew, what do you need?
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.100]  I need an ambulance
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.400]  or a fire truck or
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:04.340]  whatever. Like an emergency vehicle.
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:06.320]  Or someone to yell, wait up.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:08.760]  Yeah. It's tough.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:10.780]  Real tough.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.640]  Yeah, well, wait up is difficult
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:13.540]  when everybody's talking.
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.740]  It's an annoying thing to get.
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:17.620]  You need everyone to be quiet for it,
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.000]  but I don't want everyone to be quiet.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:21.780]  I want things to be happening.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.740]  I think there's emotion.
[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:25.560]  That's true, but it'd be tough to read
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.720]  if it's like a wait up or like come over here.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:28.500]  It's true.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:30.220]  That guy work at Best Buy?
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:31.840]  That's what it looked like.
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:35.340]  He might just be a fan.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:36.700]  Key West Buy.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.700]  There must be some event
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:43.820]  going on with these cat ears.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:45.420]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:47.600]  Maybe the Chili Dog vendor is the cat ear vendor now.
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:48.460]  Oh, maybe.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.300]  The guy's holding his neck like he's been shot in it.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.980]  Maybe the cat ears say
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:56.440]  meow fuck face on him.
[01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:58.040]  I mean, they could.
[01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:01.060]  There's a drunk ass kiss right in the middle of the sidewalk.
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:02.500]  Oh, wow, yeah.
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:04.160]  I think he's going to pork her, Dad.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:05.900]  He's not going to pork her, Russ.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.020]  There's Garrett again.
[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:09.560]  Garrett.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.780]  What time's Sloppa Cock again?
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:17.240]  11?
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.840]  11.15, we're 15 minutes away.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.780]  One of us needs to get a bingo
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:25.020]  on the second card within that 15 minutes.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.960]  Oh, we will. It has to happen.
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:28.960]  I'm about to watch somebody
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.160]  yawn and I'm going to fucking get it.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.100]  It's about to happen right now.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:33.760]  Is this woman formal?
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:35.300]  Where?
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:36.620]  No.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:39.980]  She's got real shoes on?
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:40.560]  No.
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.060]  She's wearing shorts?
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:46.820]  The standard for
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:48.740]  formal wearing real shoes.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:50.860]  Wow, there's a lot of sandals out here tonight.
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:51.640]  That's true.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:54.140]  That's a dress.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:55.740]  That bike was flying.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:57.420]  Are sandals not shoes?
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:00.800]  Sandals are shoes.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.960]  I thought shoe was a term that was all-encompassing
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.480]  for footwear.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:05.020]  I think sandals is shoes.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.440]  Is a sock a shoe?
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:09.320]  No, socks are socks.
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:11.600]  It's not all-encompassing footwear, is it?
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.360]  You know what? Fair point.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:14.600]  That's a great point.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:15.880]  Is it?
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:18.540]  No, I'm just being polite.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.720]  That's my guy.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.300]  Double fisting?
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:25.580]  Double fisting.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:27.100]  That's a good one.
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:28.620]  Leg brace.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:30.520]  Knee brace.
[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:33.180]  That's a bingo!
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:34.820]  That's not a bandage.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.480]  It's a knee brace.
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:38.500]  What are you talking about?
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:39.320]  That counts?
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.820]  Okay, fine.
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:44.480]  It's not wrapped or stuck.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.820]  It's got to be wrapped or plastered.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:50.460]  The president is against it.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:51.800]  I have a hard time agreeing with you, Geoff.
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:52.900]  That's fair.
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:54.760]  Write it down.
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:57.780]  What about that?
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:00.840]  That was a bandage.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:03.220]  Hey, I would count that
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:04.500]  just because he's limping also.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:07.500]  I personally would give it to you.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:09.080]  Alright, well, there you go.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.800]  You got a bingo for Geoff.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:14.160]  Crosswalk carrots.
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.080]  Well done.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.160]  What cake are you getting?
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:20.580]  I'm going to get...
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:22.820]  I've changed my mind.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.460]  I'm going to get a strawberry cheesecake.
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.400]  That sounds good to me.
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:30.960]  Doesn't really matter to me
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.660]  if it sounds good to you.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:32.760]  It sounds good to me.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:35.760]  Fantastic.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:37.640]  Fantastic.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.240]  I'm glad I have your approval.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:44.400]  Did you see that?
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:46.960]  The car is a fucking transformer.
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.720]  The car top was going down
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:51.180]  as it was driving. That was cool.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:53.900]  In GTA, I can only do that when I'm parked.
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:54.860]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.080]  It was really cool while I was moving.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.860]  As we have a new Patreon,
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.160]  some stuff is going to be
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.520]  exclusive to members of the Patreon.
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:05.760]  How often are we going to do stuff like this, Eric?
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.860]  This, I think...
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:10.920]  We'll do this maybe monthly.
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.220]  Depending on the tiers, we have some bonus
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.440]  supplemental stuff.
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:16.620]  This might be part of it.
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.060]  We have other things that will be happening.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:20.040]  I don't want to put...
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:21.800]  Oh yeah, we'll always do this once a month.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:23.980]  I think those things will be a little bit more fluid.
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:26.280]  A little bit more loose.
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:28.760]  But, with the Patreon,
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.900]  there's a bunch of different tiers
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:32.840]  that fit your want and need
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:35.200]  for this stuff. So, you can sign up.
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:37.360]  You can see what you get for your bonus supplementals.
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:39.120]  That would be a dead parrot head, right?
[01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:40.940]  That is so dead parrot head.
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:42.180]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:44.580]  It's like a Morton Joe without the face gear.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:45.780]  And that's a stupid hat.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:47.280]  That's a Shawn Michaels hat.
[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:50.260]  I would say...
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:52.740]  Pretty liberally, like once a month,
[01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:54.840]  you could probably look for us to be doing
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:55.860]  a Sloppy Joes bingo.
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:58.680]  But, if we don't hit it every single month,
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:00.620]  it just means we have other stuff coming out
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:02.840]  that you can also check out on Patreon.com
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.900]  slash RegulationPod.
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.200]  Then you can also watch us decide
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:08.180]  who became the president of the company
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:09.240]  and who became the secretary.
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:10.440]  That's true.
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:12.540]  Where do people go to that?
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:16.580]  That's on Patreon.com
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:18.280]  slash RegulationPod. It's free for everyone.
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.780]  Right now. You can go check it out.
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:22.820]  So, go sign up there.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:24.360]  Go see. But also,
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.700]  if you just want to listen to the podcast and support us that way,
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:27.700]  that's fine too.
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:30.860]  We'll also have just other stuff coming out.
[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:33.020]  We have some drafts that we've done recently.
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:35.180]  There's a lot we have in the hopper.
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:36.980]  A lot that we have going on
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:38.880]  really soon. A lot of regulation gameplay.
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:41.100]  Oh, yeah. Oh, a lot of regulation gameplay.
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:42.680]  One of the drafts we have, I think,
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:44.560]  might be my favorite draft. Oh, mine too.
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:46.840]  Interesting. New podcast drops
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.720]  Wednesday. It's a hot one. That's right.
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.700]  And, again, we talked about it earlier.
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.380]  We'll have more information about the where
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:54.780]  and all that at least
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:56.220]  a day before. But,
[01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:58.700]  please be patient. When you have people asking,
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.520]  when you see people posting
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:02.360]  day in and day out on
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.660]  r slash regulation pod,
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:06.660]  like, where
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.020]  can I listen? Where can I subscribe?
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.760]  We'll have more information
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:12.380]  about it soon. So, just stay patient.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.680]  Jobsboy says, with Eric being
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:16.640]  president, does it mean, does it make him Gavin's
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:18.680]  boss again? Absolutely not.
[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:22.800]  We have to figure out
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:24.780]  another game tournament to figure out
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:26.680]  performance reviews. That's a whole other
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:28.620]  situation. So,
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:30.800]  we'll do that later. But, I think
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:33.040]  that'll do it for us and Sloppy Joe's
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:34.600]  Bingo. This has been
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:36.840]  a lot of fun. Guys, any thoughts?
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:38.940]  Anything that you...
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:40.360]  Are we going to raid Frady again?
[02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:42.560]  Yeah, you know what? Honestly,
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.700]  we should. It's his birthday.
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:48.480]  Yeah, he's doing a
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:49.880]  big marathon for his birthday.
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:50.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.920]  That's what we can do right now. We can
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:55.940]  raid Frado. I think that would be a lot of fun. Andrew,
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.420]  do you have any other thoughts?
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:58.240]  Does that man have a gun?
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:01.860]  Probably did.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:03.820]  Is that a gun? I think that Florida's
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:04.780]  an open carry state.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:07.300]  There you go.
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:09.900]  Okay, well, I guess we'll see you next time
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:11.900]  Nick. You want to hit that raid? Let's do
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:13.840]  it. Geoff, I want some of
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.940]  that cake. I bet
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:17.140]  you do. We'll see you next time.
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:18.340]  Bye!
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:20.540]  Patreon.com slash RegulationPod.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.100]  See you next time. Bye!
