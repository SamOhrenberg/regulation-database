[00:00.000 --> 00:04.100]  Hey guys, what's going on? It is, uh, Regulation Friday.
[00:04.360 --> 00:06.940]  We're going to be playing some Turbo Golf Racing.
[00:07.300 --> 00:12.720]  Very excited. We are going to wait for five more seconds to see if Gavin shows up.
[00:12.820 --> 00:13.180]  Oh, yeah.
[00:14.360 --> 00:15.180]  Here he comes.
[00:15.400 --> 00:15.820]  What are the odds?
[00:17.920 --> 00:18.700]  There's no way.
[00:19.360 --> 00:20.160]  He did not.
[00:20.600 --> 00:20.640]  Okay.
[00:20.760 --> 00:21.060]  He did not.
[00:21.240 --> 00:21.660]  There you go.
[00:21.780 --> 00:22.240]  Maybe he's sleeping, all right.
[00:22.240 --> 00:22.460]  There you have it.
[00:22.820 --> 00:26.240]  So, yep. I really, I just, I expected it to happen.
[00:26.420 --> 00:28.280]  Like, fully, truly expected it to happen.
[00:28.680 --> 00:32.320]  Uh, yeah, Sonny Sleazer in the chat says I heard he's in a bad mood.
[00:32.420 --> 00:33.880]  I heard the same thing. I wasn't going to say anything.
[00:38.480 --> 00:39.840]  Man, I really dodged a bullet.
[00:39.960 --> 00:41.260]  I was going to text him earlier today.
[00:41.360 --> 00:43.300]  I had some free time to see if he wanted me to pick him up
[00:43.300 --> 00:44.780]  and we could go look for video games together.
[00:45.280 --> 00:47.440]  And then I was like, I'll do something else.
[00:47.580 --> 00:49.100]  Sounds like I dodged a bullet.
[00:49.840 --> 00:50.480]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:51.260 --> 00:55.840]  I just want to, I want to note, thank you guys so much for watching us live on Twitch.
[00:55.840 --> 00:59.460]  We're here, or we're trying to, every Friday at our new time, 4 p.m. Central.
[01:01.060 --> 01:03.880]  Which people have been really responding to pretty positively.
[01:03.980 --> 01:07.220]  Because that's 5 p.m. Eastern, which is a great time.
[01:07.420 --> 01:10.620]  You know, people getting home from work or watching on the train or whatever, going home.
[01:10.980 --> 01:13.240]  Oh, motherfucker going home to Brooklyn.
[01:13.860 --> 01:15.220]  And that's East Coast.
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.740]  And then on the West Coast, that makes it 2 p.m. where the surf's up.
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.040]  And, you know, watching this is, the sun's high, it's beautiful.
[01:24.040 --> 01:28.760]  And on the beautiful West Coast and 7 a.m. in Sydney.
[01:29.000 --> 01:29.940]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:30.320 --> 01:34.420]  I don't think it's expressly been said yet, but we are very,
[01:34.620 --> 01:38.680]  we've very clearly slid into Eric the Impressionist era.
[01:38.840 --> 01:40.380]  Yeah, I'm all for it.
[01:40.480 --> 01:42.360]  Yeah, it does feel that way.
[01:42.980 --> 01:45.820]  I've been doing a BAM impression for Geoff,
[01:45.880 --> 01:48.020]  and he's the only one that it pops every time.
[01:48.140 --> 01:50.020]  And I'm just, I'm doing it just for the love of that.
[01:50.360 --> 01:52.060]  Just it makes him giggle and it's great.
[01:52.240 --> 01:52.900]  It's really fun.
[01:52.900 --> 01:54.740]  So that invites Andrew, goddammit.
[01:55.240 --> 01:56.020]  Yeah, please.
[01:56.460 --> 01:56.960]  Thank you.
[01:58.540 --> 01:59.480]  Just want to say...
[02:00.360 --> 02:01.080]  I did.
[02:01.360 --> 02:03.820]  So just want to say thank you guys for watching.
[02:03.980 --> 02:05.980]  We'll be recording this VOD and putting it up
[02:05.980 --> 02:08.620]  on our Regulation Gameplay channel on Tuesday.
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.280]  Because that is how this works.
[02:10.360 --> 02:11.760]  That is what we do.
[02:12.260 --> 02:14.800]  So if you're not going to be able to catch this whole thing,
[02:15.100 --> 02:16.060]  don't worry.
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.400]  You can watch it later.
[02:17.680 --> 02:19.760]  And that's just as fun, isn't it?
[02:20.360 --> 02:22.600]  Christ, Andrew, look at your vehicle.
[02:23.200 --> 02:24.060]  Thank you.
[02:24.560 --> 02:25.000]  Jesus.
[02:25.740 --> 02:27.140]  It just looks advanced as fuck.
[02:27.140 --> 02:28.720]  He's just been playing without us.
[02:28.820 --> 02:29.480]  Oh, no.
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.100]  Oh, look, Eric and I have competing piss cars.
[02:33.300 --> 02:33.780]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:34.160 --> 02:34.480]  Yeah.
[02:35.380 --> 02:39.880]  Thank you to everyone dropping the Prime subs and the Twitch subs, the bits.
[02:40.420 --> 02:43.080]  We're not very good streamers, so we're not going to read your name.
[02:43.140 --> 02:44.800]  But just know that we're thinking of you.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.040]  Here's Schlappy69.
[02:48.320 --> 02:49.360]  That's the only one I'm going to read.
[02:49.700 --> 02:50.380]  Wow, dude.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:52.320 --> 02:52.800]  What's that?
[02:52.880 --> 02:53.290]  There you go.
[02:57.940 --> 02:58.320]  Schlappy?
[02:58.500 --> 02:59.300]  That's funny.
[03:00.240 --> 03:00.620]  Schlappy.
[03:00.720 --> 03:02.440]  Okay, so what are we doing, Andrew?
[03:02.580 --> 03:03.160]  What's the plan?
[03:08.580 --> 03:11.240]  Yeah, we've only done race together.
[03:11.560 --> 03:14.020]  I don't think golf mode was available at the time, but I've played it once.
[03:14.160 --> 03:14.940]  It's all right.
[03:15.420 --> 03:16.100]  Let's do it.
[03:16.640 --> 03:17.560]  I think I've done it once.
[03:17.960 --> 03:19.260]  I would never do it without you guys.
[03:19.260 --> 03:21.980]  I would never describe anything that I have as edge.
[03:24.260 --> 03:25.140]  What about edging?
[03:26.740 --> 03:27.500]  Okay, next.
[03:27.720 --> 03:28.680]  We're talking about feet.
[03:28.680 --> 03:29.400]  It starts going.
[03:29.560 --> 03:29.700]  Jesus.
[03:29.740 --> 03:30.300]  No, what?
[03:30.680 --> 03:31.040]  There was feet?
[03:31.920 --> 03:32.640]  Who said that?
[03:34.060 --> 03:35.780]  We say it two more times, Gavin will appear.
[03:37.740 --> 03:39.060]  Piss feet, piss feet, piss feet.
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.360]  Oh, it's a par five.
[03:45.020 --> 03:47.920]  Okay, so this is not a race?
[03:48.040 --> 03:48.360]  What are we doing?
[03:48.580 --> 03:49.660]  I don't know.
[03:49.940 --> 03:50.820]  I've never played this.
[03:50.820 --> 03:52.300]  Geoff, is this just golf?
[03:52.940 --> 03:54.640]  Do we go one at a time?
[03:55.340 --> 03:57.340]  I don't remember.
[03:57.720 --> 03:59.540]  It does not seem like we go one at a time.
[04:02.540 --> 04:05.300]  Okay, so it's like we take shots.
[04:05.400 --> 04:05.980]  I got it.
[04:06.300 --> 04:06.420]  Okay.
[04:06.680 --> 04:07.340]  Whoa, Geoff!
[04:08.120 --> 04:09.760]  Geoff, you launched that thing.
[04:10.320 --> 04:10.860]  Thank you.
[04:11.200 --> 04:11.620]  All right, here we go.
[04:11.620 --> 04:12.420]  I think I go first.
[04:14.180 --> 04:17.600]  I'm like the John Daly of ice turbo golf racing.
[04:18.060 --> 04:19.780]  Oh, come on, come on, come on.
[04:19.780 --> 04:20.800]  Oh, fuck.
[04:20.860 --> 04:21.700]  I'm in the weeds.
[04:22.320 --> 04:23.080]  Okay, I see.
[04:23.720 --> 04:24.080]  All right.
[04:24.180 --> 04:25.540]  I think we're all going as shots go.
[04:25.860 --> 04:26.620]  Oh, this is bad.
[04:26.940 --> 04:28.020]  This is real bad for me.
[04:28.280 --> 04:29.000]  This is interesting.
[04:29.660 --> 04:30.960]  I think I like racing more.
[04:31.660 --> 04:32.400]  I think I do, too.
[04:33.520 --> 04:36.580]  And that may have something to do with the fact I'm doing horribly.
[04:37.160 --> 04:38.420]  Yeah, that's the way this goes.
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.820]  I am way behind you, though, bud.
[04:41.760 --> 04:42.960]  I'm way back here.
[04:43.180 --> 04:44.280]  Get the hoop, get the hoop, get the hoop.
[04:44.840 --> 04:45.220]  No!
[04:45.940 --> 04:46.320]  Wahoo!
[04:46.520 --> 04:48.560]  Oh, hey, Geoff.
[04:48.660 --> 04:49.060]  There we go.
[04:50.020 --> 04:51.000]  Oh, Nick's with me, too.
[04:51.200 --> 04:52.220]  Oh, why am I still?
[04:52.940 --> 04:54.080]  Oh, I'm in the rough still?
[04:57.220 --> 04:58.240]  I'm gonna hit this tree.
[04:58.760 --> 04:59.300]  Oh, come on, come on.
[04:59.640 --> 05:01.440]  Oh, no, bend it like...
[05:01.440 --> 05:04.300]  Oh, you stupid fucking tree.
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.320]  Bend it like bitches.
[05:06.420 --> 05:08.480]  You dumb-it bitch.
[05:09.060 --> 05:09.420]  God.
[05:09.420 --> 05:09.940]  Yeah, I like that.
[05:09.960 --> 05:10.560]  It's in the hole.
[05:11.000 --> 05:11.840]  It's in the hole.
[05:12.220 --> 05:12.440]  Oh, I missed.
[05:12.600 --> 05:12.940]  Oh, shit.
[05:12.940 --> 05:13.360]  I'm on shots now.
[05:13.540 --> 05:13.900]  Shit.
[05:13.900 --> 05:14.540]  I just saw that.
[05:14.720 --> 05:15.160]  Nobody saw that.
[05:15.160 --> 05:16.280]  Shit in my mouth, dude.
[05:16.620 --> 05:19.760]  It doesn't fly up to the moon if you go through the center like it used to.
[05:20.580 --> 05:21.360]  Oh, really?
[05:21.820 --> 05:22.860]  That's good to know.
[05:22.900 --> 05:24.600]  You gotta golf that motherfucker right in.
[05:25.840 --> 05:26.760]  Here we go.
[05:27.520 --> 05:28.320]  You guys are running out of time.
[05:28.320 --> 05:29.260]  I missed my ball!
[05:29.400 --> 05:30.100]  I missed my ball!
[05:31.740 --> 05:33.260]  You're running out of time.
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.260]  Oh, there's time?
[05:35.560 --> 05:38.840]  10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.160]  Stop jumping, Eric.
[05:40.400 --> 05:42.700]  4, 3, 2.
[05:42.700 --> 05:43.520]  How do I boost?
[05:44.840 --> 05:48.200]  What do you think the best song with the name Time in it?
[05:48.380 --> 05:49.180]  Shut up.
[05:49.180 --> 05:50.160]  How do I boost?
[05:50.800 --> 05:51.340]  Time after time.
[05:52.060 --> 05:53.320]  I was gonna say the same thing.
[05:53.720 --> 05:55.140]  You boost by double tapping A.
[05:55.500 --> 05:58.420]  Okay, so I did do that, and I just kept jumping over the fucking thing.
[05:58.440 --> 05:58.680]  No, you hold B.
[05:58.920 --> 05:59.780]  No, B. You hold B.
[05:59.820 --> 06:01.060]  Yeah, B is like turbo.
[06:01.460 --> 06:02.880]  Okay, so A two times isn't the answer.
[06:03.340 --> 06:03.520]  It's a double.
[06:03.520 --> 06:04.780]  A two times is boost.
[06:05.680 --> 06:06.480]  Or dash.
[06:06.640 --> 06:07.020]  Dash.
[06:07.120 --> 06:07.620]  Whatever it's called.
[06:07.620 --> 06:08.180]  It's called dash.
[06:08.280 --> 06:08.760]  This sucks shit.
[06:08.760 --> 06:11.800]  It's called dash, but it's like a summer song.
[06:11.840 --> 06:13.140]  Fuck you.
[06:13.780 --> 06:15.720]  Boost and dash is like the same fucking thing.
[06:17.120 --> 06:18.640]  It makes you go faster.
[06:20.600 --> 06:21.560]  Stormy ricks in the chat.
[06:21.720 --> 06:22.740]  A times two equals B.
[06:27.020 --> 06:28.840]  Well, now you know how to dash and boost.
[06:28.940 --> 06:29.380]  You're welcome.
[06:29.860 --> 06:30.140]  Here we go.
[06:30.180 --> 06:30.420]  Here we go.
[06:30.540 --> 06:30.980]  Here we go.
[06:31.820 --> 06:32.040]  Boom.
[06:33.620 --> 06:36.460]  That's when you guys were like, wow, I hit it so hard.
[06:36.520 --> 06:37.580]  It's because I dashed.
[06:40.940 --> 06:41.660]  Stop talking.
[06:42.500 --> 06:42.860]  No.
[06:44.360 --> 06:45.980]  We're gonna kill you.
[06:46.360 --> 06:47.520]  We have to talk.
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.620]  It's our job to talk.
[06:50.300 --> 06:52.360]  The audience is bidding us to talk.
[06:53.380 --> 06:53.920]  Thanks, Nick.
[06:54.340 --> 06:54.820]  I'm talking, what?
[06:55.740 --> 06:55.940]  Yeah.
[06:56.500 --> 06:56.860]  Yeah.
[06:57.780 --> 06:59.920]  Just want you to know I'm with you.
[07:00.260 --> 07:01.140]  Geoff, I see what you mean.
[07:02.400 --> 07:03.200]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[07:03.560 --> 07:04.140]  You just dash and it launches.
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.800]  Do you see what I mean?
[07:06.220 --> 07:06.560]  Thank you.
[07:07.060 --> 07:08.140]  Yeah, because that's not what you...
[07:08.140 --> 07:08.860]  Oh my God.
[07:11.600 --> 07:13.180]  Oh, can I get it through that hole?
[07:13.180 --> 07:14.340]  That might be off the course.
[07:14.560 --> 07:14.860]  Uh-oh.
[07:15.080 --> 07:15.460]  Uh-oh.
[07:15.460 --> 07:15.900]  It came back.
[07:15.960 --> 07:16.860]  Oh, we're okay.
[07:17.020 --> 07:17.380]  Ah!
[07:18.100 --> 07:18.920]  Oh, no.
[07:19.120 --> 07:20.020]  It came all the way back.
[07:20.140 --> 07:20.820]  It went backwards.
[07:21.260 --> 07:22.340]  What's going on?
[07:22.760 --> 07:22.900]  Go.
[07:23.720 --> 07:24.160]  All right.
[07:24.220 --> 07:25.160]  Oh, this sucks.
[07:25.620 --> 07:26.700]  Oh, I'm almost done.
[07:26.920 --> 07:26.960]  There we go.
[07:27.380 --> 07:28.160]  Oh, get in there.
[07:29.280 --> 07:29.680]  Yeah!
[07:30.560 --> 07:31.360]  Oh, shit.
[07:31.380 --> 07:32.460]  That was incredible.
[07:35.020 --> 07:36.540]  I'm so good.
[07:36.620 --> 07:37.140]  This sucks.
[07:37.200 --> 07:37.360]  Go.
[07:37.460 --> 07:37.800]  Play racing.
[07:38.000 --> 07:38.140]  Go.
[07:38.280 --> 07:38.880]  I want to race.
[07:39.000 --> 07:39.700]  I don't want to golf.
[07:40.260 --> 07:43.080]  Yeah, we got 17 holes to go after this, dude.
[07:45.760 --> 07:46.420]  Keep rolling.
[07:46.680 --> 07:47.160]  Keep rolling.
[07:48.160 --> 07:50.120]  It's a par 9, by the way, fellas.
[07:50.560 --> 07:51.280]  Par 9.
[07:51.520 --> 07:57.040]  Oh, Nick has found his game type, I think.
[07:57.200 --> 07:57.340]  Fuck.
[07:58.200 --> 07:58.980]  I don't think so, man.
[07:58.980 --> 08:00.540]  I think this game is speaking to Nick.
[08:00.860 --> 08:01.220]  I don't...
[08:02.140 --> 08:02.860]  Don't jinx it.
[08:03.000 --> 08:03.240]  Don't jinx it.
[08:04.320 --> 08:04.880]  Get in.
[08:05.040 --> 08:05.100]  There we go.
[08:05.180 --> 08:05.380]  Get in.
[08:05.580 --> 08:06.020]  Yeah!
[08:06.920 --> 08:07.780]  Nice, Nick.
[08:08.180 --> 08:08.820]  What'd you get?
[08:08.940 --> 08:09.320]  A birdie.
[08:09.320 --> 08:10.340]  God damn it, Geoff!
[08:10.600 --> 08:10.980]  Roll forward.
[08:11.160 --> 08:11.500]  Why?
[08:13.780 --> 08:17.200]  I might come in the most under par here.
[08:17.200 --> 08:17.660]  We'll see.
[08:18.000 --> 08:18.280]  We'll see.
[08:18.680 --> 08:19.680]  I don't think so.
[08:19.880 --> 08:20.580]  You're missing it.
[08:21.860 --> 08:24.020]  I think just a little too much.
[08:24.120 --> 08:25.460]  Just a little too much English.
[08:25.760 --> 08:27.360]  Yeah, we're all gonna finish at 8.
[08:27.360 --> 08:28.420]  A bit outside breaker.
[08:32.100 --> 08:39.340]  Did you know that Bob Uecker shows up in the Monsters at Work cartoon show as the baseball
[08:39.340 --> 08:40.980]  announcer for that game, for that episode?
[08:42.220 --> 08:42.640]  No.
[08:43.060 --> 08:43.720]  What are you talking about?
[08:43.720 --> 08:45.240]  Does anyone know what any of that is?
[08:45.480 --> 08:46.560]  Do you know who Bob Uecker is?
[08:46.600 --> 08:48.140]  And you yelled at me for talking!
[08:49.940 --> 08:51.220]  Hey, Eric, it's a Let's Play.
[08:51.680 --> 08:53.460]  I know who Bob Uecker is.
[08:53.540 --> 08:55.460]  What is Monsters at Work?
[08:55.520 --> 08:57.500]  I'm guessing it's like Monsters University.
[08:57.800 --> 08:58.660]  It's like Monsters Inc.
[08:59.060 --> 09:00.940]  The show that continues after the movie.
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.700]  They came out with it a couple years ago.
[09:04.240 --> 09:05.820]  Wait, it's a TV show?
[09:05.940 --> 09:06.920]  Is it like Minute Work?
[09:07.320 --> 09:08.800]  Yeah, I think it's a great fact.
[09:08.900 --> 09:10.060]  I don't have any problem with the fact.
[09:11.360 --> 09:14.280]  Monsters at Work, like it was common knowledge.
[09:14.380 --> 09:16.020]  It was like really throwing money.
[09:16.020 --> 09:17.920]  Oh, you guys don't have kids who are under four?
[09:18.740 --> 09:22.840]  I have me.
[09:27.600 --> 09:29.580]  I was never that into Monsters Inc.
[09:29.680 --> 09:30.980]  I like the idea a lot more.
[09:31.040 --> 09:31.640]  Feel the same way.
[09:31.900 --> 09:32.280]  Execution.
[09:32.860 --> 09:34.220]  Yeah, it's not my favorite.
[09:34.740 --> 09:36.240]  Yeah, I'd rather see them at work.
[09:36.960 --> 09:40.360]  Hey, they have to turn into a laugh factory at that point.
[09:42.380 --> 09:43.880]  They have to make the kids laugh, remember?
[09:44.560 --> 09:46.400]  If I'm going to be subjected to monsters,
[09:46.440 --> 09:48.160]  I want to see them earning their trade.
[09:48.440 --> 09:49.180]  That's what I'm saying.
[09:50.340 --> 09:51.720]  I don't need them to go to school.
[09:51.920 --> 09:53.620]  They can be in like a trade.
[09:53.860 --> 09:55.360]  You know, they can be in like the technicals.
[09:55.580 --> 09:59.160]  I want to see them working goddamn hard at being the best monster they can be.
[09:59.560 --> 10:00.460]  That's what I'm talking about.
[10:01.960 --> 10:02.400]  Roll!
[10:02.900 --> 10:05.320]  Thank God for double tapping A.
[10:08.280 --> 10:10.980]  Oh yeah, double tapping A just saved my ass.
[10:13.200 --> 10:14.860]  I wonder how we all know about that.
[10:16.460 --> 10:18.680]  I already knew about it.
[10:18.680 --> 10:24.360]  Why would you ask about it if you already knew about it?
[10:25.400 --> 10:26.560]  That's a great question, Geoff.
[10:26.600 --> 10:27.220]  Why would he ask?
[10:27.440 --> 10:28.020]  Why would he even know?
[10:28.640 --> 10:29.400]  Nick understands.
[10:29.640 --> 10:30.340]  I got it.
[10:31.100 --> 10:32.660]  Oh, dude, the ball goes...
[10:32.660 --> 10:34.200]  Oh, Nick, that sucks.
[10:34.320 --> 10:35.260]  Out of bounds sucks.
[10:37.800 --> 10:39.180]  Yeah, out of bounds definitely sucks.
[10:39.340 --> 10:41.040]  Yeah, that's how golf is.
[10:41.220 --> 10:42.520]  Sucks in real golf too.
[10:42.820 --> 10:43.840]  Yeah, it sure does.
[10:44.300 --> 10:46.700]  Maybe I didn't say you're like a real asshole in real golf.
[10:46.920 --> 10:47.640]  I feel like...
[10:48.680 --> 10:49.400]  Oh, go!
[10:49.840 --> 10:52.020]  Curving it just enough where it shouldn't be doing that, man.
[10:52.040 --> 10:52.560]  That's a heartbreaker.
[10:52.560 --> 10:53.740]  Oh, baby.
[10:54.320 --> 10:56.220]  That's a big boy shot right there.
[10:56.800 --> 10:57.600]  I'm feeling good.
[10:57.600 --> 10:59.060]  I'm still a mile away.
[10:59.180 --> 10:59.620]  Yeah, right?
[10:59.720 --> 11:01.000]  Like, this is like a par 12.
[11:01.500 --> 11:01.760]  This one's crazy.
[11:01.760 --> 11:03.400]  Nick is so fucking close to...
[11:03.400 --> 11:04.000]  Dude, look at this.
[11:04.140 --> 11:05.960]  I am killing it right now.
[11:06.760 --> 11:07.260]  Telling you, Nick, this is the game.
[11:07.260 --> 11:08.620]  This should be your monster job, Nick.
[11:08.740 --> 11:10.680]  Hey, what's three under par?
[11:11.980 --> 11:13.280]  That would be a double eagle.
[11:13.700 --> 11:14.420]  Yeah, double eagle.
[11:14.460 --> 11:15.200]  Oh, or it was...
[11:15.200 --> 11:16.420]  No, is it an albatross?
[11:16.500 --> 11:17.120]  An albatross!
[11:19.300 --> 11:20.240]  Oh, no.
[11:20.540 --> 11:21.960]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.340]  I missed my ball.
[11:28.090 --> 11:29.170]  Get in! Get in!
[11:29.410 --> 11:29.690]  Yeah!
[11:30.550 --> 11:31.750]  Chad, who should I follow right now?
[11:32.750 --> 11:33.550]  Oh, no.
[11:33.930 --> 11:35.750]  That was not as good as I thought it would be.
[11:35.950 --> 11:37.070]  Why am I at 10 already?
[11:37.750 --> 11:39.230]  Should I follow Geoff, Eric, or Andrew?
[11:40.030 --> 11:40.690]  Just follow Geoff.
[11:41.070 --> 11:45.290]  Don't follow me unless you want to see lackluster, mediocre gameplay.
[11:45.930 --> 11:46.770]  Oh, everybody wants Eric.
[11:46.930 --> 11:47.590]  Okay, back to Eric.
[11:48.450 --> 11:50.130]  Oh, stop rolling!
[11:50.330 --> 11:51.490]  Jesus, gravity!
[11:52.210 --> 11:54.130]  Oh, the ball spun real cool, though.
[11:54.550 --> 11:55.470]  Yeah, I got real lucky.
[11:55.790 --> 11:57.310]  Now there's just a tree in the way.
[11:57.330 --> 11:57.950]  Oh, that sucked.
[11:58.030 --> 12:01.170]  I don't like the way this thing aligns you with your shot.
[12:01.350 --> 12:02.710]  Do you feel like it's crazy?
[12:03.130 --> 12:03.630]  It's hard.
[12:06.250 --> 12:08.390]  Oh, I fucked that up so bad.
[12:08.950 --> 12:09.530]  That was pretty cool.
[12:09.950 --> 12:10.310]  That was cool.
[12:10.310 --> 12:11.010]  Oh, no.
[12:11.650 --> 12:12.870]  Plus a billion, yay.
[12:15.450 --> 12:16.670]  Uh, there you go.
[12:16.670 --> 12:18.270]  Just straight ahead, Eric.
[12:18.910 --> 12:19.050]  Yep.
[12:20.790 --> 12:21.550]  Pull it.
[12:21.730 --> 12:23.010]  That's a little too much English on it, Nick.
[12:23.570 --> 12:24.570]  Just a bit.
[12:26.550 --> 12:27.230]  Let's see.
[12:27.330 --> 12:27.950]  Okay, here we go.
[12:28.630 --> 12:29.210]  Why does it...
[12:29.210 --> 12:30.190]  See how it's lining me up?
[12:30.330 --> 12:32.030]  Yeah, but you just angle it.
[12:33.870 --> 12:34.830]  Hey, you want to play Rocket League?
[12:36.490 --> 12:39.170]  I want to play Rocket Car Golf.
[12:39.230 --> 12:40.850]  I don't want to play Golf Golf.
[12:41.730 --> 12:43.310]  This is going to be a long 18 holes.
[12:48.550 --> 12:49.790]  Oh, you got this, Eric.
[12:49.870 --> 12:50.410]  There you go.
[12:52.850 --> 12:54.430]  On the green.
[12:56.150 --> 12:57.230]  Last chance.
[12:57.370 --> 12:57.870]  You got it.
[12:57.930 --> 12:58.750]  Here you go.
[13:03.310 --> 13:04.310]  Pretty cool.
[13:06.210 --> 13:07.290]  Pretty cool.
[13:07.830 --> 13:08.610]  Give it a little tap.
[13:08.710 --> 13:09.550]  A little tap-tappy.
[13:09.810 --> 13:11.190]  Oh, wow.
[13:11.290 --> 13:14.530]  What an ending to this shitty fucking game mode.
[13:14.910 --> 13:17.870]  Now let's do the real game mode that's good and fun.
[13:21.690 --> 13:22.730]  Joint first, Nick.
[13:22.810 --> 13:23.470]  Good job.
[13:23.570 --> 13:24.610]  Nice job, Andrew.
[13:25.170 --> 13:26.010]  I got a bronze medal.
[13:26.090 --> 13:28.210]  Hey, congratulations to all the medalists out there.
[13:28.310 --> 13:29.190]  It was a hard fight.
[13:29.250 --> 13:30.870]  All right, well, you guys have a bad life.
[13:31.090 --> 13:31.450]  That's fine.
[13:31.870 --> 13:32.450]  You just die.
[13:32.650 --> 13:32.990]  It's fine.
[13:33.030 --> 13:33.670]  It doesn't matter to me.
[13:33.710 --> 13:34.310]  Just die.
[13:37.050 --> 13:41.310]  Can we play the fast one that's fun instead of the bad one that sucks?
[13:41.610 --> 13:42.570]  Sure can.
[13:42.830 --> 13:43.330]  Thanks, man.
[13:43.330 --> 13:45.290]  Have to make a new lobby to do that.
[13:45.490 --> 13:46.770]  So I'm going to back out real quick.
[13:46.890 --> 13:47.290]  OK.
[13:47.310 --> 13:47.690]  All right.
[13:47.950 --> 13:48.150]  All right.
[13:50.470 --> 13:52.310]  Oh, yeah.
[13:52.490 --> 13:53.870]  I just got a couple of rewards.
[13:54.930 --> 13:55.130]  Ooh.
[13:57.290 --> 13:59.230]  You have to be a big shot.
[14:00.630 --> 14:01.710]  Oh, yeah, that's a good point.
[14:01.770 --> 14:02.190]  It's just a.
[14:02.890 --> 14:03.270]  There we go.
[14:03.590 --> 14:06.830]  I got some gears and some new tires and et cetera.
[14:07.090 --> 14:07.510]  This is great.
[14:07.790 --> 14:10.470]  I flip back so I can go to my menu without the fear of doxing myself.
[14:14.810 --> 14:15.850]  Invite sent.
[14:16.330 --> 14:17.890]  There it is.
[14:19.010 --> 14:20.710]  OK, I'm coming in.
[14:22.870 --> 14:25.630]  Man, I'll tell you, this thing just loads you straight into the lobby.
[14:25.730 --> 14:27.570]  There's no screwing around.
[14:28.650 --> 14:31.270]  It's good to have current gen equipment.
[14:31.450 --> 14:32.270]  Yeah, it really is.
[14:32.370 --> 14:33.050]  Oh, that's why.
[14:33.590 --> 14:34.590]  Yeah, absolutely.
[14:35.590 --> 14:36.690]  That checks out.
[14:37.470 --> 14:37.750]  Yeah.
[14:41.170 --> 14:46.290]  Instead of a but everybody tried to use like an Xbox one from when Ray was still in the company.
[14:49.010 --> 14:50.430]  Probably bought at the same time.
[14:50.510 --> 14:50.670]  Yeah.
[14:51.110 --> 14:51.330]  Yeah.
[14:54.510 --> 14:55.310]  What is this?
[14:55.450 --> 14:57.290]  OK, we get to go.
[14:58.030 --> 14:58.530]  Are you ready?
[14:58.670 --> 14:58.990]  Everybody's.
[14:59.090 --> 14:59.250]  Yeah.
[14:59.610 --> 15:01.330]  Oh, I've got the squawking macaw.
[15:02.110 --> 15:05.170]  Big shot provides a speed boost and increased power hitting the ball.
[15:06.070 --> 15:06.730]  How do we start?
[15:07.550 --> 15:08.110]  It's loading.
[15:08.610 --> 15:08.990]  Oh, OK.
[15:09.110 --> 15:09.290]  It's loading.
[15:12.590 --> 15:17.170]  But I have a mission to double tap a to dash 15 times, I mean, I just got there.
[15:17.390 --> 15:18.250]  I already did that.
[15:18.650 --> 15:22.690]  Hey, Geoff, in Rocket League, did you know there's a basketball variant?
[15:24.110 --> 15:26.610]  I 100% absolutely had no idea.
[15:27.890 --> 15:28.650]  Is it good?
[15:30.810 --> 15:33.490]  No, yeah, it's very hard.
[15:33.650 --> 15:38.430]  I don't like the way I don't like the way he said no or the way you said, yeah, it's it's difficult.
[15:39.370 --> 15:39.770]  OK.
[15:39.910 --> 15:41.070]  All right, guys, welcome to the real game.
[15:41.070 --> 15:41.350]  Very precise.
[15:41.830 --> 15:42.370]  Oh, right.
[15:42.450 --> 15:42.770]  Here we go.
[15:43.310 --> 15:44.390]  Oh, this is fast.
[15:44.510 --> 15:45.350]  I forgot how this works.
[15:48.350 --> 15:49.310]  Good, keep forgetting.
[15:50.210 --> 15:50.850]  Hold on.
[15:52.450 --> 15:53.730]  Ah, fucking dickhole.
[15:54.010 --> 15:54.410]  Remember that?
[15:54.990 --> 15:55.870]  Oh, get in there.
[15:55.910 --> 15:56.190]  Get in there.
[15:56.250 --> 15:56.610]  Get in there.
[15:57.030 --> 15:57.430]  Yes.
[15:59.990 --> 16:00.790]  Oh, yeah.
[16:01.090 --> 16:01.730]  New best.
[16:01.810 --> 16:03.070]  We got first, baby.
[16:03.150 --> 16:04.590]  I got blasted with a rocket.
[16:04.990 --> 16:06.230]  I forgot not to suck.
[16:06.690 --> 16:07.950]  Yeah, that's OK.
[16:07.950 --> 16:09.630]  Everyone's looking at your piss cards.
[16:09.770 --> 16:10.010]  Great.
[16:10.030 --> 16:11.850]  I love the fish in the bowl.
[16:13.070 --> 16:13.370]  Thank you.
[16:13.470 --> 16:13.770]  Thank you.
[16:13.870 --> 16:14.390]  You got it, bud.
[16:14.810 --> 16:15.330]  There you go.
[16:15.530 --> 16:16.530]  Way to go, Geoff.
[16:17.070 --> 16:17.470]  Nice.
[16:18.210 --> 16:19.010]  Dead last.
[16:19.210 --> 16:22.050]  Hey, congratulations to all the medalists on that bronze medal.
[16:22.790 --> 16:23.190]  Wow.
[16:23.690 --> 16:29.030]  If one of the medalists has an unfortunate accident and is not able to fulfill their duties.
[16:29.130 --> 16:31.110]  Oh, no, I won't be able to step in.
[16:33.930 --> 16:34.750]  What would happen?
[16:36.470 --> 16:37.870]  That's a great question, Nick.
[16:37.870 --> 16:39.310]  I hope we don't find out.
[16:40.010 --> 16:41.430]  That sounded like you kind of do.
[16:42.890 --> 16:43.910]  There we go.
[16:44.110 --> 16:44.710]  Oh, go, go.
[16:44.810 --> 16:45.230]  Oh, shit.
[16:45.550 --> 16:47.630]  It's not as fast as I thought it is.
[16:47.750 --> 16:48.710]  Oh, shit.
[16:51.450 --> 16:53.230]  This is a fucking fun life, man.
[16:53.350 --> 16:53.630]  Oh.
[16:54.050 --> 16:56.290]  Oh, Nick.
[16:56.370 --> 16:56.690]  No.
[16:57.050 --> 16:57.950]  Oh, I'm doing horribly.
[16:58.550 --> 17:01.110]  I was looking at my lay on my lowdown.
[17:01.230 --> 17:02.290]  Oh, for God's sake.
[17:03.910 --> 17:04.670]  That didn't do anything.
[17:06.350 --> 17:07.630]  Get the fuck in, idiot.
[17:08.970 --> 17:09.610]  Yeah, Nick.
[17:09.950 --> 17:10.550]  Wait, what?
[17:11.590 --> 17:12.650]  Jesus Christ, Geoff.
[17:12.650 --> 17:13.390]  I'm blowing it.
[17:13.570 --> 17:14.770]  Oh, shit, shit, shit.
[17:14.790 --> 17:14.990]  Boom, baby.
[17:15.550 --> 17:17.890]  All right, this is embarrassing to be the one that's on the...
[17:19.590 --> 17:20.290]  I'm watching Nick.
[17:20.370 --> 17:20.790]  Come on, Nick.
[17:20.790 --> 17:21.150]  Oh, shit, Nick.
[17:21.150 --> 17:22.310]  I didn't know that's what that did.
[17:22.650 --> 17:23.510]  I didn't know that's what that did.
[17:23.530 --> 17:24.110]  I'm watching you, Nick.
[17:24.170 --> 17:24.870]  Come on.
[17:25.690 --> 17:26.630]  So is everybody else?
[17:26.970 --> 17:27.550]  Oh, you got it.
[17:27.670 --> 17:27.990]  18.
[17:28.470 --> 17:29.030]  You missed it.
[17:29.490 --> 17:29.810]  16.
[17:30.410 --> 17:30.730]  15.
[17:30.870 --> 17:31.170]  15.
[17:31.390 --> 17:31.710]  14.
[17:31.770 --> 17:32.010]  14.
[17:32.510 --> 17:33.190]  Come on, Nick.
[17:33.970 --> 17:34.910]  Come on, down to 10.
[17:35.010 --> 17:35.330]  10.
[17:35.490 --> 17:35.830]  There we go.
[17:36.170 --> 17:36.650]  There you go.
[17:36.710 --> 17:37.030]  There you go.
[17:37.030 --> 17:37.250]  I got it.
[17:37.250 --> 17:37.650]  No worries.
[17:38.110 --> 17:39.050]  There you go.
[17:40.250 --> 17:41.650]  Wow, that's not my new best.
[17:43.410 --> 17:44.590]  First and last flipped.
[17:45.290 --> 17:45.610]  Yep.
[17:46.550 --> 17:47.190]  Yeah, that's rough.
[17:47.430 --> 17:48.430]  That's saying a lot about...
[17:48.430 --> 17:49.190]  Congratulations to Andrew Panton.
[17:50.050 --> 17:50.910]  Here we go, endurance.
[17:52.470 --> 17:54.850]  Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[17:56.970 --> 17:57.610]  Skip flyover.
[17:57.670 --> 17:58.530]  Who gives a fuck?
[18:03.790 --> 18:04.110]  Yeah.
[18:07.030 --> 18:07.630]  Oh, come on.
[18:07.770 --> 18:08.910]  Don't be going on that one.
[18:08.990 --> 18:09.690]  I see the next shot.
[18:10.010 --> 18:11.250]  Oh, it definitely went on.
[18:11.330 --> 18:12.610]  No, I missed.
[18:13.370 --> 18:14.190]  Oh, shit.
[18:14.370 --> 18:16.070]  Oh, what did I just do?
[18:16.170 --> 18:16.870]  Oh, I'm fucked.
[18:17.350 --> 18:18.390]  That's the end of me.
[18:23.450 --> 18:24.770]  I'll see y'all next...
[18:24.770 --> 18:25.790]  Oh no, I did it again.
[18:26.510 --> 18:27.410]  Oh, good.
[18:28.250 --> 18:28.530]  No.
[18:29.090 --> 18:29.710]  Aren't you...
[18:31.490 --> 18:31.970]  Go.
[18:33.270 --> 18:34.170]  There we go.
[18:34.390 --> 18:34.630]  What?
[18:34.750 --> 18:35.130]  My ball...
[18:35.130 --> 18:35.490]  No.
[18:35.750 --> 18:36.970]  Oh, you stupid fool.
[18:37.050 --> 18:37.290]  No.
[18:37.290 --> 18:41.390]  Oh, I'm stuck in the sand.
[18:42.030 --> 18:42.630]  Sorry, Geoff.
[18:43.050 --> 18:44.410]  It's my time to get ahead of Eric.
[18:44.890 --> 18:45.150]  Nope.
[18:45.150 --> 18:45.870]  See you in the sand.
[18:45.990 --> 18:46.390]  I don't think so, bud.
[18:47.270 --> 18:47.910]  Oh, crap.
[18:47.910 --> 18:48.470]  That's going out.
[18:51.890 --> 18:52.450]  Here we go.
[18:52.510 --> 18:52.950]  You wish.
[18:54.430 --> 18:55.730]  All right, just need to play my game.
[18:55.810 --> 18:56.110]  Here we go.
[18:56.450 --> 18:57.130]  There we go.
[18:59.390 --> 19:00.450]  Yeah, just play your game, man.
[19:00.790 --> 19:01.190]  Focus on the hoop.
[19:01.690 --> 19:02.090]  There we go.
[19:02.390 --> 19:03.930]  Oh, oh, it's out.
[19:04.250 --> 19:04.570]  Shit.
[19:05.130 --> 19:06.750]  I just hope Nick plays Nick's game.
[19:07.610 --> 19:09.170]  Well, I guess my game is poor.
[19:09.510 --> 19:09.930]  Bye, Andrew.
[19:11.170 --> 19:12.890]  No, no, no.
[19:13.650 --> 19:14.690]  You son of a bitch.
[19:17.190 --> 19:18.170]  There we go, there we go.
[19:18.670 --> 19:20.310]  Why do I keep jumping ahead like that?
[19:20.370 --> 19:21.910]  I keep thinking I'm playing Rocket League.
[19:21.950 --> 19:23.310]  Oh, the ball went out of bounds.
[19:23.770 --> 19:24.250]  Oh, no.
[19:24.530 --> 19:25.610]  Drop, drop, drop.
[19:25.890 --> 19:26.470]  Fuck, I missed.
[19:27.090 --> 19:27.550]  Yeah, you did.
[19:28.750 --> 19:29.110]  Fuck.
[19:30.650 --> 19:31.610]  Oh, sand, sand.
[19:31.730 --> 19:32.530]  Come on, get in, get in.
[19:33.030 --> 19:34.230]  Oh, no.
[19:34.790 --> 19:36.070]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[19:36.070 --> 19:37.210]  Did you just get that in?
[19:37.630 --> 19:38.030]  No.
[19:40.390 --> 19:41.490]  Oh, I missed.
[19:41.630 --> 19:42.590]  Get in, get in, get in.
[19:42.690 --> 19:43.230]  There we go.
[19:44.470 --> 19:45.230]  Boom, third place.
[19:45.330 --> 19:45.810]  I'll take it.
[19:46.570 --> 19:47.310]  Nick, you suck.
[19:47.710 --> 19:48.150]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:48.270 --> 19:48.830]  Oh, no.
[19:49.170 --> 19:49.890]  That sticky didn't quite stick.
[19:50.430 --> 19:52.370]  Yeah, that was good.
[19:52.970 --> 19:53.770]  What a chain.
[19:54.330 --> 19:56.350]  Hispanically Delicious in chat said,
[19:56.470 --> 19:57.750]  is this live or pre-recorded?
[19:57.770 --> 19:58.550]  It's pre-recorded.
[19:58.790 --> 19:59.190]  Yeah.
[19:59.470 --> 19:59.990]  Yeah, sorry.
[20:00.030 --> 20:01.490]  We don't do anything live anymore.
[20:01.510 --> 20:02.750]  Everything we do is pre-recorded.
[20:02.790 --> 20:03.210]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:03.750 --> 20:04.490]  Thanks for asking, though.
[20:04.490 --> 20:07.090]  We're actually, we actually recorded this sometime last week.
[20:07.410 --> 20:08.350]  Yeah, you missed this.
[20:08.530 --> 20:09.250]  Thanks for being a plant.
[20:10.250 --> 20:12.970]  Hey, Eric, hold up that newspaper that says it's June 4th.
[20:19.920 --> 20:22.100]  Yeah, I'll take the new car one.
[20:22.840 --> 20:24.120]  I got a new ugly car.
[20:24.260 --> 20:24.620]  Me too.
[20:24.760 --> 20:25.360]  Stupid life.
[20:25.600 --> 20:25.980]  All right.
[20:27.460 --> 20:28.720]  You guys want to customize anything?
[20:28.880 --> 20:29.860]  We roll right back.
[20:29.860 --> 20:31.300]  Give me a second to claim this reward.
[20:31.460 --> 20:32.840]  See what we got, then we'll get after it.
[20:33.080 --> 20:34.140]  Yeah, just let me know when you're ready.
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.340]  How does one claim rewards?
[20:36.340 --> 20:37.720]  All I got is a bunch of gears.
[20:41.460 --> 20:43.300]  Garage, stupid ugly car.
[20:43.860 --> 20:46.120]  Okay, I am ready whenever you guys are.
[20:46.140 --> 20:46.580]  I'm good.
[20:47.040 --> 20:48.040]  Take your time, take your time, take your time.
[20:49.460 --> 20:51.920]  Is it me or is Geoff just not feeling it today?
[20:52.340 --> 20:56.300]  What are you, I've been dropping comedy bombs every, oh my lord.
[20:56.560 --> 20:58.020]  No, I agree with that chatter.
[20:58.560 --> 20:59.920]  Yeah, I agree with Orion Kirby.
[21:00.060 --> 21:01.220]  Geoff is not feeling it.
[21:01.340 --> 21:01.880]  Orion Kirby.
[21:02.160 --> 21:03.960]  I'm feeling it so fucking hard right now.
[21:03.980 --> 21:06.060]  Guys, I'm starting to think that, guys, I'm starting to think Geoff's in a bad mood.
[21:06.060 --> 21:08.480]  I'm edging so hard right now.
[21:08.560 --> 21:11.380]  I think him wanting to call Gavin may have pulled him into the orbit of Earth.
[21:11.380 --> 21:11.700]  Oh no!
[21:12.560 --> 21:12.960]  Yeah.
[21:13.460 --> 21:14.300]  You just wait.
[21:14.340 --> 21:15.740]  All right, Andrew, I think we're ready.
[21:15.740 --> 21:16.680]  I'm gonna come right up in both of you.
[21:16.700 --> 21:17.200]  It's loading.
[21:17.240 --> 21:18.020]  Oh, okay.
[21:19.020 --> 21:20.100]  Yeah, he's feeling the pressure.
[21:20.880 --> 21:21.480]  You're cum free.
[21:23.160 --> 21:25.000]  Well, if you're edging, yeah.
[21:25.500 --> 21:26.780]  Is that like Gavin's cousin?
[21:30.320 --> 21:32.260]  This one was an accident, his name's Cum.
[21:34.120 --> 21:38.060]  Oh, man, I don't think Orion Badoinkle's feeling it today.
[21:38.480 --> 21:40.200]  His comments have just been off.
[21:48.510 --> 21:48.910]  Shit!
[21:49.390 --> 21:51.030]  Oh, I lynched it out of bounds!
[21:51.670 --> 21:53.130]  Oh, we did the same thing, Nick.
[21:54.030 --> 21:54.430]  Yeah.
[21:54.710 --> 21:55.270]  Come on.
[21:55.510 --> 21:56.790]  Oh, fucking damn it!
[21:58.250 --> 21:58.650]  And...
[21:59.570 --> 22:00.790]  Oh, is that a gap?
[22:00.950 --> 22:01.250]  Shit.
[22:01.410 --> 22:02.330]  Oh, you stupid.
[22:02.570 --> 22:04.630]  Yeah, if you can make it, but I couldn't.
[22:05.390 --> 22:05.950]  Oh, I got it.
[22:05.950 --> 22:07.130]  No, I didn't.
[22:07.130 --> 22:07.730]  Damn it.
[22:07.890 --> 22:08.250]  Go!
[22:11.850 --> 22:13.030]  Did someone get it in already?
[22:13.510 --> 22:14.230]  Bad, bad, bad.
[22:14.230 --> 22:14.630]  What was that?
[22:15.110 --> 22:16.490]  Was that your boy, Lil' Geoffy?
[22:16.630 --> 22:17.190]  It was Edge, man.
[22:19.890 --> 22:20.610]  Oh, shit!
[22:20.990 --> 22:22.830]  Fuck me, I'm doing terribly right now.
[22:23.490 --> 22:24.850]  Oh, I'm doing worse than you, Nick.
[22:24.970 --> 22:30.350]  Hey, Andrew, somebody in the chat asked if we would ever consider doing a regular regulation.
[22:30.570 --> 22:30.830]  What?
[22:30.930 --> 22:32.270]  A regulation sub-a-thon?
[22:32.270 --> 22:33.290]  I think I'm feeling it.
[22:33.390 --> 22:34.410]  Um, what is that?
[22:34.790 --> 22:35.310]  I don't know what that means.
[22:35.310 --> 22:36.390]  Are you asking me?
[22:36.910 --> 22:38.010]  Because you're the Twitch guy.
[22:38.250 --> 22:38.970]  I like...
[22:38.970 --> 22:40.230]  So here's the thing about this.
[22:40.310 --> 22:40.450]  Yes!
[22:40.630 --> 22:46.030]  We keep defaulting to Andrew being the Twitch guy, and he's not, and so every question is funny.
[22:46.690 --> 22:48.610]  He's done more Twitching than the rest of us, though.
[22:48.970 --> 22:50.190]  That's definitely not true.
[22:50.470 --> 22:53.270]  He one time Twitched for 30 straight days, I watched it.
[22:53.290 --> 22:55.930]  That was like four years... well, longer than that at this point.
[22:56.090 --> 22:57.790]  And you've Twitched since then as well.
[22:58.210 --> 22:58.610]  You see what I'm saying?
[22:58.610 --> 22:59.350]  Yeah, a handful of times.
[22:59.410 --> 23:00.570]  Eric has definitely streamed.
[23:00.590 --> 23:01.710]  That was the height of PUBG.
[23:01.930 --> 23:03.730]  Eric... or Nick, so has... as well.
[23:04.370 --> 23:04.730]  Yeah.
[23:05.170 --> 23:07.570]  All right, Eric's now in charge of the Twitching, then.
[23:07.930 --> 23:08.610]  Yeah, I don't care.
[23:08.730 --> 23:09.770]  Eric, what's a subathon?
[23:10.170 --> 23:11.490]  For God's sake!
[23:11.730 --> 23:16.770]  Where you do, uh, where you do subscription stuff, and uh, every subscription, like,
[23:16.850 --> 23:17.690]  keeps the thing going.
[23:17.950 --> 23:20.810]  Is that the thing where, like, Jeremy and Alfredo don't go to bed anymore?
[23:21.250 --> 23:21.450]  Yes.
[23:21.530 --> 23:22.310]  I don't wanna do that.
[23:22.350 --> 23:24.910]  So the answer to that question is no, we aren't gonna do that.
[23:25.470 --> 23:26.010]  I'd rather take a nap.
[23:26.030 --> 23:29.710]  I'll only do it if Demar DeRozan gets on the pod.
[23:29.710 --> 23:32.750]  All right, all right.
[23:32.850 --> 23:34.710]  Hey, Andrew, you want to talk about a really good nap?
[23:34.810 --> 23:36.150]  Take it during one of those streams.
[23:43.290 --> 23:45.190]  Oh, no, come on!
[23:45.290 --> 23:46.610]  Such a bad performance.
[23:47.110 --> 23:47.790]  Locked in.
[23:48.530 --> 23:49.010]  There we go.
[23:49.370 --> 23:50.990]  Get it in the beam.
[23:51.410 --> 23:53.590]  How could someone so good at this be so bad?
[23:55.810 --> 23:59.950]  I think you have to re-evaluate the first part based on the second.
[24:01.750 --> 24:02.870]  Oh, no, no.
[24:02.870 --> 24:05.030]  Oh, there we go.
[24:05.050 --> 24:06.210]  No, the fuck.
[24:06.590 --> 24:07.210]  Get in.
[24:07.430 --> 24:07.890]  There you go.
[24:08.210 --> 24:09.030]  Don't you dare.
[24:09.370 --> 24:10.490]  Don't you fucking dare.
[24:12.150 --> 24:12.510]  No.
[24:14.130 --> 24:14.490]  No.
[24:15.110 --> 24:16.490]  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[24:16.650 --> 24:18.310]  No, you piece of shit.
[24:18.410 --> 24:19.550]  God, I'm so bad at this.
[24:19.870 --> 24:20.790]  Geoff, that's me.
[24:20.890 --> 24:21.530]  I'm a piece of shit.
[24:21.650 --> 24:22.090]  I love you, Geoff.
[24:22.090 --> 24:22.870]  Son of a bitch.
[24:23.610 --> 24:24.150]  I'm a little bit.
[24:24.150 --> 24:25.210]  Look at how close it is.
[24:25.290 --> 24:26.330]  Less than a second.
[24:26.630 --> 24:28.030]  Get in, get in, get in, get in.
[24:28.150 --> 24:28.510]  No!
[24:29.510 --> 24:30.250]  It's so bad.
[24:30.250 --> 24:33.030]  You sat in my shit and it's on your chair.
[24:33.710 --> 24:36.130]  Better go clean it up.
[24:37.070 --> 24:39.190]  I'm doing so badly.
[24:40.610 --> 24:44.270]  No, a filthy animal in the chest as Nick is throwing for content, I think.
[24:44.470 --> 24:45.710]  Yeah, that's what's happening.
[24:45.930 --> 24:46.710]  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.
[24:47.030 --> 24:47.930]  Yeah, you nailed it.
[24:49.130 --> 24:50.770]  And nothing else.
[24:55.170 --> 24:58.470]  Remember when Mike Tyson threw it against Buster Douglas for content?
[24:59.030 --> 24:59.230]  Yeah.
[24:59.230 --> 24:59.450]  Right.
[25:01.070 --> 25:02.770]  November now, that fake fight.
[25:03.270 --> 25:03.630]  Dumb.
[25:03.810 --> 25:06.070]  You think it'll happen?
[25:07.190 --> 25:07.330]  Yeah.
[25:07.450 --> 25:07.690]  No.
[25:08.210 --> 25:08.690]  Too much money.
[25:08.790 --> 25:09.810]  I also don't think it will.
[25:10.150 --> 25:10.410]  Sorry.
[25:10.510 --> 25:14.110]  I think Jake Paul's gonna fight Mike Perry now, which will be ridiculous.
[25:15.650 --> 25:19.330]  You ready for UFC 303, the thing you were excited for and then quickly were not excited for?
[25:21.450 --> 25:22.810]  Are you shitting me?
[25:24.170 --> 25:24.350]  Yeah.
[25:24.470 --> 25:25.610]  No, he pulled out.
[25:26.230 --> 25:26.870]  Of what?
[25:28.350 --> 25:29.870]  Nick has no idea.
[25:30.010 --> 25:30.870]  We're talking about Comfrey.
[25:31.170 --> 25:31.430]  Yeah.
[25:33.170 --> 25:35.730]  Word on the street is he didn't pull out.
[25:37.450 --> 25:38.570]  That's where he is today.
[25:41.650 --> 25:43.010]  There we go.
[25:43.150 --> 25:44.750]  Oh, we're flying.
[25:46.940 --> 25:47.750]  Oh, right.
[25:47.910 --> 25:49.250]  Don't overfly your ball.
[25:49.630 --> 25:53.810]  I forgot about the flying in this game.
[25:54.310 --> 25:55.130]  Yeah, it's pretty.
[25:55.230 --> 25:56.110]  I'm upside down.
[25:56.970 --> 25:58.290]  Hey, brag about it.
[25:59.610 --> 26:00.570]  I definitely.
[26:00.890 --> 26:01.570]  What the fuck?
[26:04.070 --> 26:05.030]  Oh, shit.
[26:05.770 --> 26:06.650]  I Eric did.
[26:07.370 --> 26:08.370]  Yeah, I missed it.
[26:09.250 --> 26:10.610]  I jumped over it completely.
[26:12.370 --> 26:14.190]  Let's try to boost into it, and I jumped it.
[26:14.310 --> 26:14.390]  Yeah.
[26:15.450 --> 26:16.450]  I forgot I could do this.
[26:17.110 --> 26:17.470]  No.
[26:18.210 --> 26:19.250]  All right, well, I'm back in it.
[26:19.250 --> 26:20.470]  Yeah, the game.
[26:20.810 --> 26:21.390]  There we go.
[26:22.470 --> 26:23.770]  I was winning this one now.
[26:26.070 --> 26:27.130]  Oh, Andrew, is that you?
[26:27.270 --> 26:27.850]  That was a nice hit.
[26:29.150 --> 26:29.790]  Thanks, man.
[26:29.990 --> 26:30.830]  Oh, here he comes.
[26:31.110 --> 26:32.070]  Oh, look at Eric flying in.
[26:32.410 --> 26:32.730]  Yeah.
[26:32.790 --> 26:33.750]  That's a lot of style.
[26:34.270 --> 26:35.030]  That was sick.
[26:35.790 --> 26:37.290]  Yeah, that was pretty fucking cool.
[26:39.090 --> 26:39.730]  Oh, achievement.
[26:41.470 --> 26:41.890]  Oh, really?
[26:42.830 --> 26:44.090]  Only 100 cosmetic items.
[26:44.210 --> 26:45.310]  I guess I did a challenge or something.
[26:45.890 --> 26:46.170]  Oh.
[26:48.230 --> 26:49.410]  Hey, thanks for watching, y'all.
[26:50.730 --> 26:51.130]  Oh, joining.
[26:51.210 --> 26:52.030]  Yeah, it's about to join.
[26:52.030 --> 26:52.330]  Are we done?
[26:52.430 --> 26:52.950]  Look at that.
[26:53.710 --> 26:55.530]  That sounded like a goodbye, thanks.
[26:55.990 --> 26:56.690]  It did.
[26:56.870 --> 26:57.770]  Yeah, Nick's out of here.
[26:57.890 --> 26:58.390]  Oh, yeah.
[26:58.910 --> 27:00.290]  All right, thanks for watching, everybody.
[27:00.410 --> 27:01.510]  We'll see you on the stream for content.
[27:02.130 --> 27:03.310]  I should have told y'all before I hosted.
[27:09.770 --> 27:10.490]  Let's see. Hang on.
[27:10.550 --> 27:11.630]  I got claiming a couple of rewards.
[27:12.310 --> 27:12.530]  Yeah.
[27:12.570 --> 27:13.610]  You gotta get your rewards, man.
[27:14.190 --> 27:15.150]  Where do you go for rewards?
[27:16.230 --> 27:16.590]  Adventures.
[27:17.230 --> 27:18.330]  It's like big.
[27:18.490 --> 27:19.090]  Oh, yeah.
[27:19.410 --> 27:22.450]  And then you can also scroll right and left, too.
[27:22.450 --> 27:23.810]  There's multiple pages of adventures.
[27:23.990 --> 27:26.370]  Just, you know, it took me a while to figure that out.
[27:27.150 --> 27:27.590]  Stupid.
[27:30.910 --> 27:32.330]  Let's see what we got here, folks.
[27:32.470 --> 27:33.270]  A thousand gears.
[27:34.410 --> 27:36.470]  That'll come in handy for Gears playthrough.
[27:37.490 --> 27:38.710]  You don't even know.
[27:39.130 --> 27:40.250]  Not how the game works.
[27:41.390 --> 27:43.610]  Have we died a thousand times yet, Geoff?
[27:43.730 --> 27:45.250]  You think in our years run?
[27:46.990 --> 27:49.470]  It's probably under, but not by a lot.
[27:51.210 --> 27:54.730]  That is such a good fucking question.
[27:55.190 --> 27:56.330]  Still in act one.
[27:56.990 --> 27:59.630]  Yeah, I think we probably have.
[28:00.490 --> 28:02.110]  What was your estimate for how long it'll take?
[28:02.210 --> 28:02.650]  You're good.
[28:03.250 --> 28:03.390]  Yeah.
[28:03.590 --> 28:06.910]  Oh, I think 56 parts is what I said.
[28:07.710 --> 28:10.090]  They think 65 or 64.
[28:10.630 --> 28:13.290]  Hey, guys, get ready to get catfished.
[28:15.370 --> 28:15.930]  Catfished?
[28:16.190 --> 28:17.950]  Yeah, that's my my new decal.
[28:18.670 --> 28:19.990]  Oh, I don't.
[28:20.210 --> 28:20.390]  OK.
[28:20.610 --> 28:21.250]  They're cat and fishes.
[28:21.430 --> 28:21.810]  I don't think.
[28:22.170 --> 28:23.890]  Are you aware of the term catfish?
[28:24.110 --> 28:26.130]  Yeah, that's something I would say.
[28:26.550 --> 28:28.130]  I'm ready whenever you guys are.
[28:28.250 --> 28:29.010]  What are you talking about?
[28:30.190 --> 28:31.250]  Do you like it?
[28:31.330 --> 28:32.630]  Now, Nick, you like food, right?
[28:32.670 --> 28:33.270]  You're a food guy.
[28:33.330 --> 28:33.990]  We've talked about this.
[28:34.130 --> 28:34.870]  Nick, you like food.
[28:35.010 --> 28:35.190]  Yeah.
[28:35.270 --> 28:36.170]  Are you about to catfish me?
[28:37.710 --> 28:39.170]  Sounds like you do know what it means.
[28:39.490 --> 28:41.610]  Are you a fan of the food?
[28:44.510 --> 28:45.270]  That's pretty good.
[28:45.490 --> 28:46.830]  That was such a sad documentary.
[28:46.830 --> 28:47.330]  It was.
[28:49.390 --> 28:50.670]  Imagine if you played on your team.
[28:51.170 --> 28:53.370]  And also way funnier than I realized at the time.
[28:55.410 --> 28:56.170]  Have you?
[28:57.410 --> 28:59.410]  Are you a fan of catfish the food?
[29:00.070 --> 29:02.930]  Like, would you go to the catfish parlor and eat catfish?
[29:03.310 --> 29:04.490]  Yeah, it's OK.
[29:04.790 --> 29:06.970]  You have to be in a mood for catfish the food.
[29:07.810 --> 29:07.830]  What?
[29:07.990 --> 29:09.770]  Yeah, but you would you would eat it.
[29:10.350 --> 29:10.670]  Oh, yeah.
[29:11.630 --> 29:12.030]  Yeah.
[29:12.690 --> 29:16.550]  And you know how you eat cans of salmon just in your kitchen?
[29:16.550 --> 29:17.110]  Yeah, sure.
[29:18.490 --> 29:21.990]  Imagine you went to do that and there was chicken in the can.
[29:22.730 --> 29:23.450]  That's catfished.
[29:23.770 --> 29:24.790]  Oh, catfish.
[29:29.510 --> 29:31.670]  It's to educate you on the term chicken fish.
[29:36.700 --> 29:38.700]  Oh, man, I'm just not feeling it.
[29:41.680 --> 29:42.960]  That's why we don't do streams.
[29:43.080 --> 29:43.700]  This is pretty good.
[29:44.640 --> 29:46.000]  This is why all our content is edited.
[29:46.560 --> 29:47.140]  Oh, you know.
[29:48.720 --> 29:49.340]  Oh, go.
[29:53.880 --> 29:55.560]  Come on, get in the wind tunnel.
[29:56.040 --> 29:56.880]  Oh, damn.
[29:57.380 --> 30:00.060]  Oh, can I nail that?
[30:00.240 --> 30:02.960]  No, I should have just gone for the goal.
[30:05.040 --> 30:05.220]  Yeah.
[30:08.190 --> 30:09.510]  There we go.
[30:09.990 --> 30:12.230]  Oh, oh, oh, shit.
[30:12.430 --> 30:13.110]  Oh, my God.
[30:14.270 --> 30:15.270]  That was insane.
[30:15.290 --> 30:15.830]  That was cool.
[30:18.070 --> 30:19.030]  Oh, and I was last.
[30:20.090 --> 30:20.730]  Oh, man.
[30:21.010 --> 30:21.250]  OK.
[30:21.630 --> 30:22.830]  Oh, yeah, it's going to show us a cool shot.
[30:23.110 --> 30:24.590]  Oh, shot of the match.
[30:27.110 --> 30:28.810]  Whoa, I overshot it.
[30:28.930 --> 30:31.230]  Oh, that was cool.
[30:32.770 --> 30:34.050]  Dude, that was sick, Andrew.
[30:34.170 --> 30:34.630]  That was awesome.
[30:35.290 --> 30:36.290]  That was a total accident.
[30:38.130 --> 30:39.610]  Better be looking at good points.
[30:41.550 --> 30:42.750]  I wasn't either, though.
[30:43.930 --> 30:45.330]  I mean, that was lucky, wasn't it?
[30:45.910 --> 30:46.350]  Yeah, I guess.
[30:46.430 --> 30:47.330]  Yeah, that's fair.
[30:48.130 --> 30:48.670]  Hey, Andrew.
[30:49.230 --> 30:49.470]  Yeah.
[30:49.630 --> 30:50.970]  Let me ask you a question.
[30:51.270 --> 30:51.710]  OK.
[30:52.710 --> 30:56.510]  In your personal life outside of this company that we're now doing together,
[30:56.850 --> 30:58.970]  what video game are you playing for fun?
[31:00.830 --> 31:02.870]  Uh, Doom Eternal right now.
[31:03.210 --> 31:03.790]  Oh, really?
[31:04.030 --> 31:04.450]  Interesting.
[31:04.730 --> 31:09.030]  Yeah, I never I went through and I played all the Doom games and I had never played that one.
[31:09.110 --> 31:12.030]  And to get ready for the new one, I'm playing it.
[31:12.330 --> 31:13.230]  How are you liking it?
[31:13.570 --> 31:14.890]  It's a lot of fun. It's really cool.
[31:14.950 --> 31:15.270]  There we go.
[31:15.630 --> 31:16.770]  It's a it's a cool game.
[31:17.130 --> 31:17.990]  It's a great game.
[31:17.990 --> 31:18.990]  Well, he's interested.
[31:19.350 --> 31:21.350]  It's such an interesting point in time where there's,
[31:21.530 --> 31:24.330]  I guess, a lot of cool new stuff out, but there's so much cool old stuff.
[31:25.270 --> 31:26.650]  Did you see that, Nick?
[31:28.030 --> 31:31.210]  Yeah, it's just so fun to see.
[31:31.670 --> 31:33.410]  Like Gavin's playing GTA 4 right now.
[31:33.470 --> 31:34.490]  It's wild for some reason.
[31:34.970 --> 31:37.330]  You know, Eric, you were playing Fallout 4 for a while.
[31:38.110 --> 31:38.730]  It's cool.
[31:38.950 --> 31:44.030]  It's like there's such a catalog of easily accessible,
[31:45.130 --> 31:47.530]  world class content available at all times.
[31:47.530 --> 31:47.970]  It's cool.
[31:49.610 --> 31:50.850]  Skip the flyover.
[31:52.030 --> 31:52.530]  Oh, yeah.
[31:52.530 --> 31:53.070]  I'm skipping it.
[31:53.210 --> 31:54.150]  I just played Riders Republic all day long.
[31:54.690 --> 31:55.950]  You're still into Riders Republic?
[31:56.170 --> 31:56.950]  I was curious about that.
[31:58.130 --> 32:00.110]  Yeah, I might be back into Fallout, though.
[32:00.170 --> 32:00.430]  I don't know.
[32:00.430 --> 32:01.950]  I had a lot of fun playing it the other day.
[32:03.270 --> 32:05.350]  Riders Republic is on sale right now.
[32:05.410 --> 32:06.030]  Is it worth getting?
[32:06.330 --> 32:06.450]  You think?
[32:06.470 --> 32:07.030]  I love it.
[32:07.110 --> 32:07.870]  I fucking love it.
[32:08.010 --> 32:08.170]  Okay.
[32:11.670 --> 32:12.190]  I'll look into that.
[32:12.190 --> 32:12.630]  Out of bounds.
[32:13.930 --> 32:14.170]  Damn.
[32:15.150 --> 32:15.890]  I love it.
[32:15.930 --> 32:17.850]  If you love Tony Hawk, you know.
[32:18.010 --> 32:18.410]  Is that weird?
[32:18.410 --> 32:18.910]  Okay, well then, yeah.
[32:18.910 --> 32:21.370]  To turn it on so we can affect each other's balls.
[32:21.570 --> 32:22.370]  That sounded weird.
[32:22.710 --> 32:24.270]  I don't think so.
[32:24.490 --> 32:25.490]  A collision or something?
[32:25.730 --> 32:26.590]  Yeah, like collision.
[32:27.030 --> 32:27.950]  Maybe I'll back out after this.
[32:27.950 --> 32:29.930]  I want to be able to run into you guys.
[32:30.030 --> 32:30.150]  Yeah.
[32:30.190 --> 32:30.890]  I don't care about the balls.
[32:31.050 --> 32:32.250]  I want to run into you.
[32:32.550 --> 32:33.250]  It's time to bip.
[32:34.550 --> 32:34.730]  Yeah.
[32:35.330 --> 32:35.990]  Ooh, Andrew.
[32:36.590 --> 32:36.990]  Ooh.
[32:38.190 --> 32:38.970]  It's a rough one.
[32:39.610 --> 32:40.670]  All the way down at the bottom.
[32:41.010 --> 32:41.530]  Joint second.
[32:43.970 --> 32:45.670]  I got no points for that.
[32:46.490 --> 32:47.350]  Yeah, you suck.
[32:47.350 --> 32:49.490]  Dude, Jesus.
[32:51.230 --> 32:51.630]  Aggressive.
[32:53.250 --> 32:53.650]  Orchestra.
[32:54.690 --> 32:55.850]  I got the orchestra.
[32:56.690 --> 32:57.470]  Oh, that's cool.
[32:57.790 --> 32:58.850]  I wonder if I'll hit that.
[33:00.270 --> 33:01.050]  We'll do that.
[33:01.150 --> 33:02.210]  And back out and make a new lobby.
[33:02.470 --> 33:02.950]  Oh, okay.
[33:03.690 --> 33:04.430]  Somebody asked...
[33:04.430 --> 33:05.810]  You're going to make a new lobby again?
[33:06.090 --> 33:08.330]  I've ever been to Captain Pete's on Lake Travis?
[33:08.590 --> 33:09.250]  I don't think so.
[33:10.270 --> 33:10.490]  Captain Pete's.
[33:10.490 --> 33:11.910]  What a specific question.
[33:12.130 --> 33:12.990]  That is very specific.
[33:12.990 --> 33:13.510]  They have good catfish.
[33:13.510 --> 33:15.610]  Somebody thinks they saw you at Captain Pete.
[33:15.750 --> 33:16.110]  Oh.
[33:16.470 --> 33:17.130]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:17.910 --> 33:20.730]  They thought I rolled up, like, on a ship.
[33:24.270 --> 33:25.470]  All right, let's see.
[33:25.670 --> 33:27.470]  It doesn't look like there's anything for collision.
[33:27.950 --> 33:28.170]  Damn.
[33:34.060 --> 33:35.400]  Did we go...
[33:35.400 --> 33:36.240]  Oh, yeah, I guess we did.
[33:36.660 --> 33:37.980]  Because you're switching out.
[33:39.240 --> 33:40.140]  Yeah, he's starting a new lobby.
[33:40.520 --> 33:40.780]  Yep.
[33:41.060 --> 33:43.620]  I like the cosmetics in this game.
[33:44.200 --> 33:44.820]  Yeah, they're fun.
[33:44.900 --> 33:45.160]  Done well.
[33:45.740 --> 33:48.100]  You get something almost every time you play.
[33:48.100 --> 33:49.260]  You just keep going.
[33:49.720 --> 33:50.000]  Yeah.
[33:52.040 --> 33:53.580]  It was pretty good on...
[33:53.580 --> 33:54.880]  I felt like Rocket League for a while.
[33:54.980 --> 33:56.200]  Then they made the game free to play.
[33:57.920 --> 33:59.640]  And everything was suddenly, you know...
[33:59.640 --> 34:01.600]  I mean, it was probably paywall to begin with.
[34:01.700 --> 34:04.320]  But if you paid for the game, you had a lot of easier access to stuff.
[34:05.300 --> 34:09.060]  It's super limited and, like...
[34:09.060 --> 34:12.420]  Like, few and far between the upgrades in Riders Republic.
[34:12.600 --> 34:14.260]  It's one of the things that bugs me about it is...
[34:14.260 --> 34:14.620]  I agree.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.300]  You can have so many different outfits and shit.
[34:17.300 --> 34:18.480]  And it just takes forever.
[34:19.380 --> 34:20.400]  Well, they want you to...
[34:20.400 --> 34:21.640]  Or you got to spend real money.
[34:22.040 --> 34:22.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[34:22.400 --> 34:23.720]  Because it's a Ubisoft game, right?
[34:25.820 --> 34:26.220]  Oh...
[34:27.420 --> 34:28.740]  Waiting on Geoff to join.
[34:29.380 --> 34:29.800]  Oh, sorry.
[34:30.080 --> 34:30.200]  Sorry.
[34:30.340 --> 34:31.880]  I have my invites turned off.
[34:32.580 --> 34:33.500]  Notifications turned off.
[34:33.860 --> 34:34.680]  And I have to check.
[34:35.240 --> 34:37.440]  Oh, see, here's how I deal with that.
[34:37.540 --> 34:40.840]  If you add me on Xbox and I don't know you, I just block you.
[34:41.540 --> 34:43.560]  And then that solves the problem.
[34:43.840 --> 34:45.640]  Well, I haven't turned off because I've been filming.
[34:46.460 --> 34:46.860]  Ah.
[34:46.860 --> 34:51.660]  Like there's nothing worse than being 10 minutes into a nature shot and having a fucking...
[34:52.600 --> 34:55.380]  Bilbo McDorky-doo-doo invite you to a party.
[34:55.820 --> 34:57.720]  Or you get an achievement for standing still.
[35:00.140 --> 35:00.540]  Yeah.
[35:01.340 --> 35:02.760]  Or you get an achievement for standing still.
[35:04.640 --> 35:05.040]  All right.
[35:05.480 --> 35:06.300]  Let's do this thing.
[35:06.400 --> 35:07.260]  I feel good about this one.
[35:07.260 --> 35:08.460]  This one's for real women.
[35:09.080 --> 35:09.840]  Yeah, that's what I...
[35:09.840 --> 35:11.340]  The other one, I think, goes to practice.
[35:12.120 --> 35:15.520]  Remember what Andrew was saying before we went live about how he wanted to make sure
[35:15.520 --> 35:17.340]  everybody knew that today was for the boys?
[35:17.640 --> 35:18.940]  Yeah, I don't like...
[35:18.940 --> 35:19.540]  Why did he keep saying that?
[35:19.540 --> 35:19.860]  He was like...
[35:19.860 --> 35:21.820]  He kept saying Friday is for the boys.
[35:22.080 --> 35:23.700]  Friday, according to Andrew.
[35:24.160 --> 35:24.460]  Yeah.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.860]  Andrew's been quiet about it right now.
[35:27.880 --> 35:28.780]  Yeah, what's up, man?
[35:28.920 --> 35:29.760]  I'm locked in.
[35:31.800 --> 35:32.680]  Triple win.
[35:34.080 --> 35:35.860]  I'm definitely losing this round.
[35:36.040 --> 35:37.580]  I'm getting my dick pushed in.
[35:38.900 --> 35:41.700]  I have an innie now after this.
[35:42.800 --> 35:43.660]  There you go.
[35:44.260 --> 35:44.640]  Look me up.
[35:48.300 --> 35:48.940]  Is that it?
[35:49.160 --> 35:49.620]  Go, go.
[35:51.640 --> 35:53.100]  Oh, I was so close.
[35:53.180 --> 35:53.800]  Don't go out of bounds.
[35:54.180 --> 35:54.520]  Come on.
[35:56.560 --> 35:57.520]  You also, me.
[35:57.740 --> 35:59.400]  Oh, yo, you piece of shit.
[36:00.020 --> 36:00.940]  Yeah, I saw that.
[36:01.600 --> 36:01.980]  What happened?
[36:03.620 --> 36:04.620]  Maybe, Andrew, what happened?
[36:05.240 --> 36:06.820]  Maybe you turned into Frosty mode.
[36:07.040 --> 36:07.740]  Frosties are delicious.
[36:10.420 --> 36:11.820]  Ah, I just missed that.
[36:11.960 --> 36:12.080]  Damn.
[36:13.160 --> 36:13.500]  Oh, shit.
[36:14.420 --> 36:15.000]  Get in.
[36:16.440 --> 36:17.400]  Come on.
[36:21.200 --> 36:22.160]  Oh, no.
[36:22.400 --> 36:22.920]  Get in there.
[36:24.800 --> 36:25.280]  Woo.
[36:26.140 --> 36:26.520]  No.
[36:27.280 --> 36:27.760]  Damn.
[36:28.040 --> 36:28.720]  Take that, Andrew.
[36:28.820 --> 36:29.240]  You suck.
[36:30.440 --> 36:31.960]  Yeah, I'm coming for you.
[36:32.240 --> 36:33.760]  I'm coming for you.
[36:34.520 --> 36:37.780]  Geoff, you got to hit the A button twice to hit that boost, you know?
[36:38.600 --> 36:39.700]  Yeah, if you want to dash.
[36:40.140 --> 36:40.380]  Yeah.
[36:41.220 --> 36:41.740]  Wicked.
[36:44.740 --> 36:47.660]  All I was able to do is win the first three fucking rounds.
[36:48.380 --> 36:48.580]  Yeah.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.340]  Oh, the ones that didn't count?
[36:51.600 --> 36:52.660]  Yeah, the ones that weren't really good.
[36:52.680 --> 36:53.760]  The practice rounds.
[36:53.780 --> 36:54.600]  The practice rounds?
[36:54.700 --> 36:55.260]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[36:55.760 --> 36:56.300]  Oh, that's cool.
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.600]  That was let Geoff win.
[36:58.240 --> 36:59.960]  Banner 18 tonight, baby.
[37:00.680 --> 37:02.160]  Maybe that's why I'm playing well.
[37:02.600 --> 37:04.800]  Oh, tonight's the night.
[37:06.800 --> 37:07.620]  Is that tonight?
[37:08.060 --> 37:08.580]  Yes.
[37:11.460 --> 37:14.160]  It's the only thing on Earth that matters right now.
[37:14.520 --> 37:14.960]  Yeah.
[37:16.160 --> 37:21.020]  I was close to going, but man, the fucking tickets in Dallas are expensive.
[37:21.520 --> 37:23.440]  I don't know why people are paying...
[37:23.440 --> 37:25.100]  Dallas people are paying that much money to go watch their team.
[37:25.100 --> 37:26.000]  To watch them lose?
[37:26.140 --> 37:27.380]  To watch them get fucking swept?
[37:27.760 --> 37:28.100]  Yeah.
[37:29.760 --> 37:30.200]  Ridiculous.
[37:30.780 --> 37:31.020]  Yeah.
[37:32.220 --> 37:33.420]  Pretty, pretty rough trade.
[37:33.600 --> 37:35.220]  I'm probably just trying to help people like you.
[37:36.020 --> 37:36.460]  Oh, definitely.
[37:36.600 --> 37:37.700]  Well, guess what?
[37:37.700 --> 37:40.720]  My udders are closed for business because I said no.
[37:43.400 --> 37:44.080]  Oh.
[37:44.820 --> 37:45.660]  There we go.
[37:45.980 --> 37:46.960]  Said I'm sorry.
[37:47.100 --> 37:48.600]  I've installed nipple shields.
[37:48.700 --> 37:52.220]  I am not available for milking.
[37:52.880 --> 37:54.180]  That's what you said.
[37:54.580 --> 37:55.040]  So you...
[37:55.820 --> 37:55.960]  No!
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.140]  You're gooner free.
[37:58.600 --> 37:59.360]  You're milk free.
[37:59.740 --> 38:00.460]  This is good, dude.
[38:00.980 --> 38:01.440]  Yeah, man.
[38:02.360 --> 38:04.600]  That's completely unrelated to comfrey.
[38:05.040 --> 38:06.380]  That's a different person.
[38:07.940 --> 38:09.140]  That's Gavin's cousin.
[38:09.240 --> 38:11.100]  It's a real family reunion over here.
[38:11.160 --> 38:12.060]  It is.
[38:15.780 --> 38:17.960]  Comfrey kind of sounds like one name, too, though.
[38:18.260 --> 38:20.060]  It'd be funny if his name was Comfrey Free.
[38:22.240 --> 38:26.160]  I mean, it's just one of those things where in the finals,
[38:26.260 --> 38:29.200]  no team has ever gone up 3-0 and then lost the whole thing, right?
[38:29.500 --> 38:30.500]  No team has ever lost.
[38:31.060 --> 38:31.760]  It's never...
[38:31.760 --> 38:32.440]  I hate those.
[38:32.880 --> 38:33.920]  I hate those.
[38:34.660 --> 38:38.480]  Teams are 0-156 when they're down 3-0.
[38:38.520 --> 38:38.940]  You're like, great.
[38:39.120 --> 38:40.300]  So that means we get to be the...
[38:41.060 --> 38:42.400]  Oh, historical moment.
[38:43.120 --> 38:44.140]  That'd be really cool.
[38:44.840 --> 38:45.680]  Yeah, wouldn't that be crazy?
[38:45.800 --> 38:46.160]  Geoff History.
[38:46.180 --> 38:48.340]  I mean, people win a championship every year.
[38:48.440 --> 38:49.620]  That doesn't happen every year.
[38:49.860 --> 38:51.600]  Wouldn't that be history, dude?
[38:51.620 --> 38:52.220]  Bigger accomplice.
[38:52.280 --> 38:53.020]  Wouldn't that be really special?
[38:53.480 --> 38:54.040]  I'd rather just...
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.460]  It's looking, you know...
[38:56.460 --> 39:02.080]  Celtic's Instagram was being a little cheeky with the Porzingis teases.
[39:02.080 --> 39:03.820]  So I'm thinking maybe he might play tonight.
[39:03.980 --> 39:04.640]  And if so...
[39:04.640 --> 39:05.380]  I think he probably is.
[39:05.780 --> 39:10.080]  I've been out of bounds almost every hit so far on this round.
[39:10.580 --> 39:11.460]  This is really bad.
[39:11.640 --> 39:14.060]  Oh, it's in the hole!
[39:14.440 --> 39:15.600]  You shouldn't be out here!
[39:15.920 --> 39:17.860]  I think Andrew's gonna take it, dude.
[39:17.940 --> 39:18.780]  I got nothing.
[39:22.980 --> 39:23.460]  No!
[39:25.100 --> 39:26.680]  I watched Geoff score that.
[39:26.920 --> 39:27.660]  Well, you got a new best.
[39:27.660 --> 39:28.420]  I just...
[39:28.420 --> 39:28.920]  That's because you were behind me.
[39:28.920 --> 39:30.580]  I went out of bounds probably five times.
[39:30.900 --> 39:31.560]  That's really rough.
[39:33.520 --> 39:35.100]  Of course you watched me score.
[39:35.120 --> 39:36.320]  I was right in front of you.
[39:36.700 --> 39:37.660]  Still finished second?
[39:37.860 --> 39:39.740]  Went out of bounds seven times and I beat Nick?
[39:39.980 --> 39:40.180]  Wow.
[39:40.620 --> 39:41.560]  Fuck you, Eric!
[39:41.980 --> 39:43.140]  I was the worst in this one.
[39:44.200 --> 39:45.360]  Second the best.
[39:45.480 --> 39:46.320]  That's pretty impressive.
[39:46.600 --> 39:47.760]  Clearly not feeling it.
[39:47.760 --> 39:48.320]  God damn it.
[39:48.580 --> 39:48.940]  Hey, Geoff.
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.140]  Who do you think remembers when the Red Sox came back from 3-0 deficit more?
[39:54.200 --> 39:55.520]  The Yankees or the Red Sox?
[39:56.560 --> 39:58.780]  I think the Yankees remember more, dude.
[39:59.260 --> 40:00.180]  That's what I don't want.
[40:00.540 --> 40:03.940]  I don't want to remember it more than the fucking Dallas fans.
[40:04.040 --> 40:05.920]  But it already happened to Boston one time on the other.
[40:06.760 --> 40:07.480]  I know!
[40:09.680 --> 40:10.480]  That's baseball, though.
[40:10.480 --> 40:11.200]  That's completely different.
[40:11.620 --> 40:11.640]  Yep.
[40:12.640 --> 40:13.700]  Let's get into the next one.
[40:13.760 --> 40:15.340]  Guys, thanks so much for watching so far.
[40:15.460 --> 40:15.940]  We're on Twitch.
[40:16.040 --> 40:16.800]  We're live right now.
[40:16.880 --> 40:19.040]  This VOD will be up on Tuesday, so you can watch it later.
[40:19.640 --> 40:21.900]  Unless Nick deletes it due to his gameplay.
[40:23.200 --> 40:24.740]  That's just up to him, I suppose.
[40:25.360 --> 40:25.720]  Nick got a win!
[40:25.740 --> 40:26.980]  Those Prime subs also.
[40:27.080 --> 40:29.620]  If you got a Prime sub, take the money out of Geoff Bezos' pocket,
[40:29.620 --> 40:30.720]  put it into our pocket.
[40:30.880 --> 40:31.420]  Thank you so much.
[40:32.140 --> 40:35.180]  If you tuned in looking to see Gavin in the stream,
[40:35.300 --> 40:39.180]  he came in earlier briefly and said he specifically was trying to avoid you.
[40:39.440 --> 40:39.800]  Yeah.
[40:39.940 --> 40:40.680]  He'd be leaving.
[40:40.920 --> 40:41.300]  And his cousin.
[40:41.300 --> 40:43.860]  I don't know what that's about, but I guess you guys got beef.
[40:44.400 --> 40:44.960]  Dude, that's awesome.
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.280]  Somebody tried to add me on Discord.
[40:47.500 --> 40:48.320]  Go ahead and block them.
[40:48.560 --> 40:49.100]  Block, done.
[40:50.840 --> 40:52.500]  He also is avoiding his cousin, Cum.
[40:53.460 --> 40:54.000]  Oh, yeah.
[40:54.320 --> 40:54.680]  Cumfrey.
[40:55.100 --> 40:56.120]  Oh, you just want to hang out with Cumfrey?
[40:56.280 --> 40:58.440]  No, he's kind of a black sheep of the family.
[41:00.160 --> 41:00.860]  Uh-oh.
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.220]  He's the sticky sheep of the family.
[41:04.700 --> 41:05.460]  Sticky sheep.
[41:09.880 --> 41:11.720]  Oh, I just sat in something.
[41:12.100 --> 41:12.580]  Cumfrey!
[41:12.960 --> 41:15.080]  I can't believe we got a pity laugh from Andrew.
[41:15.220 --> 41:15.420]  Whoopsie!
[41:17.780 --> 41:18.780]  That's so lame.
[41:20.800 --> 41:21.880]  He's dialed in, man.
[41:21.940 --> 41:22.460]  That's what's up.
[41:22.740 --> 41:22.940]  Yeah.
[41:24.680 --> 41:26.400]  I've lost which way is the hole.
[41:28.380 --> 41:29.200]  That's unfortunate.
[41:30.180 --> 41:31.800]  One kid it is, then.
[41:35.070 --> 41:35.860]  Well, yeah.
[41:40.410 --> 41:40.860]  No!
[41:42.540 --> 41:43.060]  Yeah.
[41:46.780 --> 41:48.660]  Oh, my God!
[41:49.380 --> 41:49.740]  100%.
[41:59.180 --> 42:01.060]  Oh, fucking dickhead idiot, Geoff.
[42:01.340 --> 42:02.300]  God damn it.
[42:02.720 --> 42:03.720]  Oh, I hate me.
[42:05.780 --> 42:07.860]  Well, you know, that's, you know, yeah.
[42:10.100 --> 42:11.240]  I had that, Nick.
[42:11.300 --> 42:12.540]  You snuck that in.
[42:12.580 --> 42:12.860]  Good work.
[42:13.060 --> 42:13.600]  Yeah, thanks, man.
[42:13.620 --> 42:14.840]  I thought you beat me by a long shot.
[42:15.460 --> 42:17.760]  No, I just, I kept bopping it around the wrong way.
[42:18.660 --> 42:19.480]  Who am I watching, Andrew?
[42:20.160 --> 42:21.220]  Yeah, I got stuck.
[42:21.500 --> 42:22.940]  He's the only one who hasn't scored yet.
[42:23.020 --> 42:23.760]  You got it. You got to hit it.
[42:23.820 --> 42:25.520]  You got to hit in the hoop there, baby.
[42:26.140 --> 42:27.400]  Yep, there it is.
[42:27.780 --> 42:29.040]  There it is.
[42:30.020 --> 42:30.740]  Is that what they're saying?
[42:31.200 --> 42:31.920]  Now, shoot, baby, shoot.
[42:31.940 --> 42:33.660]  Remember when they said scoop?
[42:33.760 --> 42:34.220]  There it is.
[42:34.260 --> 42:34.960]  And it was the ice cream.
[42:35.080 --> 42:35.840]  And it was ice cream.
[42:36.000 --> 42:36.180]  Yeah.
[42:37.020 --> 42:39.180]  Didn't they change it for the Frito scoops then, too?
[42:39.820 --> 42:40.200]  Oh, yeah.
[42:40.300 --> 42:40.880]  I think that's fine.
[42:40.980 --> 42:41.680]  I like that one.
[42:41.780 --> 42:43.200]  I thought that was fun.
[42:43.720 --> 42:45.380]  I thought scoop, there it is, was a fun thing.
[42:45.540 --> 42:45.820]  Yeah.
[42:46.760 --> 42:48.880]  It was like peanut butter, chocolate cookie dough.
[42:49.040 --> 42:49.380]  Yeah.
[42:50.680 --> 42:51.380]  Good for them.
[42:51.460 --> 42:52.620]  That song came out like 1991.
[42:53.060 --> 42:56.420]  So getting some life in it in like, you know, 2021 is pretty cool.
[42:56.540 --> 42:59.480]  To get to be a one hit wonder that just gets to draw
[42:59.480 --> 43:02.020]  some form of revenue for the rest of your life
[43:02.020 --> 43:03.980]  because of like 30 minutes of work you did
[43:03.980 --> 43:06.500]  when you were drunken high in a bathroom at a college party.
[43:07.860 --> 43:08.700]  It's pretty cool.
[43:13.070 --> 43:15.770]  In this scenario, that's where you came up with the idea for the song.
[43:16.090 --> 43:16.890]  No, no, I get it.
[43:16.890 --> 43:18.650]  Yeah, just I'm just more for the audience.
[43:18.870 --> 43:20.250]  And yeah, just yeah.
[43:20.490 --> 43:21.830]  Oh, to give them more context.
[43:23.010 --> 43:23.270]  Hey, Geoff.
[43:23.730 --> 43:24.190]  Hello.
[43:24.430 --> 43:25.070]  Oh, shit.
[43:25.550 --> 43:25.970]  Goodbye.
[43:33.070 --> 43:33.990]  Come on.
[43:34.550 --> 43:36.140]  Oh, for God's sake.
[43:36.990 --> 43:38.330]  Come on, get up there.
[43:39.190 --> 43:40.150]  Flying the wrong way.
[43:40.350 --> 43:40.770]  There we go.
[43:42.930 --> 43:43.230]  Where's that?
[43:43.330 --> 43:44.190]  Oh, I just messed up.
[43:46.990 --> 43:47.350]  Boom.
[43:49.690 --> 43:50.130]  Hey.
[43:53.070 --> 43:55.850]  Oh, I'm so stupid.
[43:55.950 --> 43:57.330]  Laugh like a like a villain.
[43:57.490 --> 44:00.430]  Yeah, I don't like the way he's don't like the way he's doing it.
[44:00.830 --> 44:01.270]  No.
[44:02.270 --> 44:03.130]  Get in there.
[44:04.690 --> 44:07.670]  Don't like the way you said that as if you're already about to score.
[44:08.010 --> 44:09.270]  Yeah, wrong in there.
[44:09.930 --> 44:10.690]  Okay, thank you.
[44:12.150 --> 44:12.870]  That's better.
[44:17.290 --> 44:17.730]  Oh.
[44:19.090 --> 44:20.390]  I don't know if that's good.
[44:21.350 --> 44:22.470]  Oh, that's good.
[44:23.330 --> 44:24.090]  There we go.
[44:24.290 --> 44:25.210]  Oh, what a pretty room.
[44:26.470 --> 44:26.890]  Cool.
[44:27.050 --> 44:27.570]  We're moving.
[44:27.690 --> 44:28.450]  We're moving here.
[44:28.550 --> 44:30.470]  It's like a shiny anus.
[44:30.830 --> 44:31.250]  Shit.
[44:31.550 --> 44:31.770]  What?
[44:31.930 --> 44:33.490]  That's what you consider a pretty room?
[44:34.590 --> 44:36.510]  I mean, if if there's something else.
[44:36.610 --> 44:40.910]  Yeah, I guess it's a confusing post waxed.
[44:41.970 --> 44:42.570]  Oh, for sure.
[44:44.650 --> 44:45.070]  No.
[44:53.790 --> 44:54.510]  Oh, God.
[45:02.160 --> 45:08.560]  Oh, I had it, too.
[45:08.660 --> 45:09.680]  That's very disappointing.
[45:10.480 --> 45:11.060]  But then you did.
[45:11.140 --> 45:12.440]  Andrew was in there early, man.
[45:12.600 --> 45:12.960]  Jesus.
[45:13.780 --> 45:14.380]  Got in that hole.
[45:14.660 --> 45:14.960]  Less.
[45:15.060 --> 45:16.660]  You were like less than half a second behind.
[45:17.280 --> 45:17.640]  Frustrating.
[45:17.900 --> 45:20.940]  I just well, we have bets going on on the stream on the side,
[45:20.960 --> 45:23.400]  and I saw there was one for who will win or something
[45:23.400 --> 45:26.400]  and then realized it was not related to the round we were playing.
[45:26.400 --> 45:27.300]  Let's lock in.
[45:27.440 --> 45:28.500]  Let's try an extra hard.
[45:30.360 --> 45:31.020]  Uh oh.
[45:32.700 --> 45:35.800]  Eric just typed in the chat that his internet might be going out.
[45:36.500 --> 45:37.920]  I can hear you guys, kind of.
[45:39.360 --> 45:39.880]  All right.
[45:39.920 --> 45:42.160]  Sounds like the three of us are guaranteed medals in this round.
[45:42.580 --> 45:43.780]  Oh, push.
[45:45.480 --> 45:46.640]  Oh, Geoff, you suck.
[45:47.920 --> 45:48.800]  Oh, this is easy.
[45:48.840 --> 45:49.620]  It's a baby course.
[45:50.020 --> 45:50.560]  Oh, no.
[45:50.820 --> 45:51.820]  I didn't know it was a baby course.
[45:51.960 --> 45:53.180]  Get it in the baby course.
[45:53.520 --> 45:53.880]  I missed.
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.920]  No, I shot you for nothing.
[46:00.500 --> 46:03.640]  That's exactly what I want to hear is the last thing on earth.
[46:04.140 --> 46:05.340]  I shot you for nothing.
[46:08.240 --> 46:08.880]  Damn it.
[46:10.220 --> 46:11.020]  17.85.
[46:11.880 --> 46:14.320]  Yeah, my thing keeps popping up with connection issues,
[46:14.380 --> 46:16.320]  and I've been having internet problems for like the last couple of days.
[46:16.720 --> 46:17.080]  Oh, really?
[46:17.820 --> 46:19.760]  Yeah, I just I have to keep resetting it.
[46:19.820 --> 46:20.580]  I don't know what's going on.
[46:21.000 --> 46:21.480]  You should move.
[46:22.660 --> 46:23.320]  I agree.
[46:26.780 --> 46:28.840]  That's my answer for everything now that I've moved.
[46:28.940 --> 46:30.160]  Yeah, now that you've moved.
[46:30.320 --> 46:32.480]  Yeah, I mean, it was such a cool process.
[46:32.740 --> 46:35.360]  No, I mean, it was such a cool process to go through with you, man.
[46:35.480 --> 46:37.420]  Yeah, I couldn't get enough of it every day.
[46:37.800 --> 46:38.820]  I could tell you were having fun.
[46:38.980 --> 46:39.820]  So I was having fun.
[46:40.640 --> 46:43.720]  90 days of abject torture and utter hell.
[46:43.920 --> 46:44.440]  Yeah, yep.
[46:44.720 --> 46:45.460]  It's the worst.
[46:46.660 --> 46:47.380]  Oh, God.
[46:49.620 --> 46:51.660]  It is looking at that Austin housing market, though.
[46:51.740 --> 46:53.520]  Thank Christ I sold my house when I did.
[46:53.880 --> 46:54.280]  Yep.
[46:55.740 --> 46:56.820]  We'll get a reward.
[46:57.900 --> 46:58.620]  2000 gears.
[46:58.780 --> 46:59.560]  I'll take them.
[47:01.100 --> 47:01.860]  I'm buying a car.
[47:02.820 --> 47:03.380]  Oh, yeah.
[47:03.880 --> 47:04.380]  Where are you?
[47:05.060 --> 47:05.460]  Whoa.
[47:06.440 --> 47:07.360]  You go to shop.
[47:07.440 --> 47:08.800]  You can like there's like a lot you can buy.
[47:09.740 --> 47:10.880]  Andrew, that looks cool.
[47:11.360 --> 47:12.320]  What kind of car are you buying?
[47:12.440 --> 47:12.680]  Whippy?
[47:13.220 --> 47:14.060]  I'm getting Whippy.
[47:14.980 --> 47:15.380]  Nice.
[47:16.140 --> 47:16.500]  Oh.
[47:18.500 --> 47:20.980]  What was the name of the like ball I have?
[47:21.560 --> 47:23.400]  What was the name of the twisted metal?
[47:24.300 --> 47:24.960]  Clown dude.
[47:25.100 --> 47:25.540]  Sweet Tooth?
[47:25.700 --> 47:26.180]  Sweet Tooth.
[47:27.340 --> 47:29.380]  Has anybody watched that by anybody?
[47:29.600 --> 47:31.880]  I just mean the idiots on the call with me.
[47:32.280 --> 47:35.300]  Have any of y'all watched the that TV show?
[47:35.640 --> 47:36.820]  No, yeah, don't don't worry.
[47:36.900 --> 47:37.780]  Chat will answer anyway.
[47:38.420 --> 47:43.020]  Um, the have not watched it want to because there's a there's an actor that I really like.
[47:43.080 --> 47:43.960]  You know, this guy, Mike Mitchell.
[47:44.200 --> 47:45.180]  I really want to Samoa Joe.
[47:46.040 --> 47:48.720]  Samoa Joe also in it, but voiced by Will Arnett.
[47:48.780 --> 47:50.700]  When we got the actor, you really liked it.
[47:50.780 --> 47:50.980]  Yeah.
[47:51.480 --> 47:53.360]  Can't get enough Samoa Joe's acting.
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.580]  We were in New Orleans a couple of years ago, and the Airbnb we were staying at
[47:58.580 --> 48:01.600]  was a block away from where they were shooting in a bar for that show.
[48:02.480 --> 48:03.460]  They had the whole street.
[48:03.660 --> 48:04.040]  Oh, that's cool.
[48:04.260 --> 48:06.400]  Yeah, it was like, what the hell are they shooting in there?
[48:06.420 --> 48:07.580]  It was like, oh, yeah, it's twisted metal.
[48:08.320 --> 48:08.680]  Weird.
[48:09.460 --> 48:11.480]  They came all the way to New Orleans to shoot in this bar.
[48:13.480 --> 48:14.140]  I don't see.
[48:14.220 --> 48:14.820]  I think it's so funny.
[48:14.900 --> 48:17.640]  They led with The Last of Us and Twisted Metal.
[48:17.880 --> 48:19.480]  Like two shows.
[48:19.660 --> 48:21.740]  It's so there is so sorry.
[48:21.740 --> 48:23.600]  It's my Internet slowing down.
[48:23.980 --> 48:27.700]  How's the how's The Last of Us shooting going in Vancouver Island?
[48:28.060 --> 48:29.280]  Is it still going on?
[48:29.540 --> 48:30.840]  No, it's finished here.
[48:30.920 --> 48:33.440]  I think they're still filming in Vancouver and that type of thing.
[48:35.360 --> 48:39.780]  Made me realize how insane it is that they spent like two or three weeks
[48:40.280 --> 48:45.340]  setting up a set that they filmed two days on and then two more weeks to unpack.
[48:46.860 --> 48:50.220]  It's what I hate about the industry and why I don't want anything to do with it anymore
[48:50.220 --> 48:52.380]  and why I just want to do podcasts and video games with y'all.
[48:54.600 --> 48:57.400]  It just made me think about like when I watch a show now,
[48:57.840 --> 49:02.140]  how many different cities are in one episode that look like linear places?
[49:05.060 --> 49:06.480]  Oh, that is crazy to think about.
[49:10.850 --> 49:13.830]  It's like the exterior of like all the old sitcoms are never the.
[49:14.070 --> 49:14.970]  It's like sets, right?
[49:15.410 --> 49:16.650]  All those old shows.
[49:18.450 --> 49:19.930]  Like you've seen in movies,
[49:19.930 --> 49:23.970]  you've seen the always sunny set in 10,000 TV shows and movies.
[49:28.980 --> 49:29.860]  First place.
[49:31.520 --> 49:32.800]  Oh, Eric disconnected.
[49:33.100 --> 49:35.540]  Oh, I was like, oh, at least it'd be in the heat.
[49:38.100 --> 49:38.700]  Get out of the kitchen.
[49:39.220 --> 49:41.660]  Oh yeah, Andrew, somebody wants a donut update.
[49:41.780 --> 49:43.120]  Are you able to get back to your donuts now?
[49:43.160 --> 49:44.020]  I can, yeah.
[49:44.240 --> 49:45.460]  Donuts fall in rotation.
[49:45.940 --> 49:46.200]  Congratulations.
[49:46.920 --> 49:47.500]  Thank you.
[49:48.080 --> 49:49.100]  Get myself a cronut.
[49:49.560 --> 49:49.960]  Oh.
[49:52.140 --> 49:52.860]  Pretty good.
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.000]  I was, you know, since I moved without doxing myself,
[49:58.140 --> 49:59.940]  I used to kind of live out in the burbs.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.680]  And whereas before that, I'd spent a long time like closer into the city.
[50:06.900 --> 50:07.180]  Oh, yeah.
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.980]  And I couldn't really like walk to anywhere or anything.
[50:11.140 --> 50:12.840]  It was real pretty where I live, but it was just kind of boring.
[50:13.040 --> 50:15.140]  And since I've moved to a different part of town,
[50:15.160 --> 50:18.180]  I can walk to like 12 different coffee shops now.
[50:18.180 --> 50:18.720]  Oh shit.
[50:18.860 --> 50:22.380]  So fucking cool to be able to go to shit again.
[50:23.220 --> 50:23.580]  Oh.
[50:24.960 --> 50:26.540]  Like the most exciting thing.
[50:29.820 --> 50:30.800]  You're too late.
[50:31.400 --> 50:33.920]  Have you become a coffee shop hangout guy?
[50:34.980 --> 50:37.140]  Oh, I've been a coffee shop hangout guy for a very long time.
[50:37.240 --> 50:38.620]  I'm actually less of one now.
[50:39.480 --> 50:39.880]  Interesting.
[50:40.440 --> 50:44.360]  Because my old routine when we were doing Fuckface, So Alright,
[50:44.360 --> 50:52.120]  and the other one, Anma for our tea was I would go spend two or three days a week
[50:52.120 --> 50:56.760]  at a certain coffee shop just sitting outside eating tacos and drinking iced coffee and
[50:56.760 --> 50:59.560]  writing bits or ideas and stuff or doing research.
[50:59.780 --> 51:01.040]  Yeah, that's where I spent most of my time.
[51:02.240 --> 51:03.380]  I don't do that at all now.
[51:04.060 --> 51:04.460]  Fuck.
[51:04.660 --> 51:08.220]  I feel like when we were forming the company, too, we spent a lot of time in coffee shops.
[51:08.820 --> 51:09.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:09.540 --> 51:10.200]  It's a good place to meet.
[51:10.660 --> 51:11.280]  It was really good.
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.400]  And who's going to turn down coffee?
[51:15.600 --> 51:15.740]  Right?
[51:16.560 --> 51:16.960]  Exactly.
[51:19.540 --> 51:21.180]  I'm all about hot chocolate now.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.240]  You can get them at some coffee shops.
[51:23.760 --> 51:25.500]  Hey, I've been a supporter since day one.
[51:29.200 --> 51:30.720]  Oh, go.
[51:31.940 --> 51:32.320]  Come on.
[51:33.280 --> 51:33.680]  Yeah.
[51:34.040 --> 51:35.620]  Oh, it feels so good when you get in the hoop.
[51:36.800 --> 51:39.620]  Man, the hot chocolate argument and the fucking
[51:39.620 --> 51:43.960]  in immunity bullet arguments in the upcoming episode.
[51:44.240 --> 51:44.980]  Oh, my God.
[51:45.120 --> 51:48.320]  I was trying to explain them to Emily, and I decided you're just going to have to listen.
[51:48.580 --> 51:49.860]  Yeah, honestly, I do it just.
[51:49.980 --> 51:52.400]  I don't think that any explanation can fully.
[51:53.940 --> 51:55.780]  Save it, you know, I mean, it's damaged.
[51:56.680 --> 52:01.420]  I realized my issue with the immunity bullet is the people I was fighting with,
[52:01.420 --> 52:03.780]  but the design of the the tool.
[52:04.300 --> 52:05.240]  That's my issue.
[52:08.060 --> 52:09.600]  I mean, yeah, it's dumb.
[52:09.620 --> 52:11.200]  We're so far removed from it now.
[52:11.280 --> 52:12.940]  I couldn't even explain it to you if I wanted to.
[52:13.740 --> 52:14.100]  I just.
[52:15.820 --> 52:17.000]  Yeah, I don't want to get into it.
[52:17.100 --> 52:19.520]  Yeah, I'm definitely not on your side, though, Andrew.
[52:20.400 --> 52:23.340]  It's no, you're just a wrong side of history.
[52:25.400 --> 52:26.300]  But you are.
[52:29.780 --> 52:30.180]  Oh.
[52:32.900 --> 52:37.200]  I wonder if I mean, if when I get Eric's audio, he's just going to be cursing.
[52:37.920 --> 52:38.800]  In the back.
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.200]  You should just you should just lower us like 80% so you can just hear us
[52:45.200 --> 52:48.120]  whispering in the background, and it's just Eric cursing at his monitor.
[52:48.400 --> 52:50.780]  Like it's smashing his router.
[52:53.700 --> 52:55.600]  They just crossfade back into us.
[52:55.920 --> 52:57.360]  Good, good, good round.
[52:57.460 --> 52:57.760]  Good round.
[52:57.840 --> 52:58.260]  Good round.
[52:58.360 --> 52:59.300]  Yeah, that's great.
[52:59.300 --> 53:00.920]  I'm in the coffee.
[53:06.340 --> 53:06.840]  Wars.
[53:07.420 --> 53:09.380]  Somebody asked us what our favorite games were.
[53:10.500 --> 53:11.200]  Video games.
[53:11.400 --> 53:11.600]  Yeah.
[53:13.340 --> 53:15.340]  Board games are cool, but I like video games best.
[53:16.760 --> 53:18.860]  I like what a dumb answer to that question.
[53:20.680 --> 53:21.180]  Um.
[53:22.760 --> 53:23.800]  Favorite video games.
[53:24.620 --> 53:25.920]  That's a hard question to answer.
[53:26.080 --> 53:26.900]  It is really tough.
[53:26.980 --> 53:27.820]  I feel like it switches.
[53:27.820 --> 53:29.440]  Yeah, Halo three.
[53:29.840 --> 53:34.060]  It's like what games are the most impactful to you as opposed to like what your favorite is?
[53:34.460 --> 53:35.940]  What remains the Edith Finch?
[53:36.120 --> 53:36.960]  Maybe is my favorite.
[53:37.100 --> 53:38.320]  That was what that person said, too.
[53:38.580 --> 53:40.120]  Actually, mine are so dumb.
[53:40.500 --> 53:42.680]  It's Gems of War and Peggle.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.200]  Peggle is a great one.
[53:45.480 --> 53:47.340]  Oh, dude, I fucking you know what?
[53:47.340 --> 53:48.440]  I'm excited about Fable.
[53:48.600 --> 53:49.600]  I love Fable.
[53:49.660 --> 53:50.460]  I'm so excited.
[53:50.660 --> 53:53.860]  I'm so I'm so I fucking I'm a huge.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.320]  I even loved Fable three.
[53:55.320 --> 53:59.500]  I even tried to play the stupid Kinect Fable game, even though it was unplayable.
[54:00.720 --> 54:04.980]  I wish the bar, the gambling game was available to play.
[54:05.240 --> 54:06.460]  Yeah, Jen, that was a lot of fun, even.
[54:09.460 --> 54:13.240]  I mean, obviously, I guess I owe my entire career to Halo, so that's pretty cool.
[54:13.400 --> 54:14.480]  Yeah, it becomes like a weird thing.
[54:14.720 --> 54:17.160]  I've never met any of you guys without Halo.
[54:17.580 --> 54:18.020]  So it's yeah.
[54:19.300 --> 54:20.540]  Impact has to be Halo.
[54:20.940 --> 54:21.440]  Hit man.
[54:21.520 --> 54:22.740]  Are we playing a game together?
[54:23.320 --> 54:23.460]  Yes.
[54:23.860 --> 54:24.240]  Are we not?
[54:24.240 --> 54:24.620]  Okay.
[54:25.840 --> 54:26.520]  Three of us?
[54:26.600 --> 54:26.720]  Yeah.
[54:27.320 --> 54:27.520]  Okay.
[54:27.600 --> 54:28.900]  Nothing changed outside of Eric leaving.
[54:30.460 --> 54:30.860]  Yeah.
[54:32.480 --> 54:32.880]  Yeah.
[54:33.380 --> 54:34.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:34.440 --> 54:34.840]  Get him.
[54:35.060 --> 54:36.220]  I'm surprised Gavin isn't here.
[54:37.300 --> 54:39.600]  Because he was all gung ho about filming earlier.
[54:40.340 --> 54:40.840]  Yeah, he was.
[54:41.360 --> 54:43.980]  I was kind of hoping he'd get to play this because he hasn't played this yet.
[54:44.620 --> 54:46.260]  That's sort of one of my reasons for picking this.
[54:46.280 --> 54:49.840]  I wasn't trying to not film this morning either, by the way.
[54:49.860 --> 54:50.920]  I'm down to film another video.
[54:50.980 --> 54:53.060]  I was just correcting his incorrect counting.
[54:54.240 --> 54:55.140]  Oh, no, I was with you.
[54:55.280 --> 54:56.940]  He said we'd film nine videos.
[54:57.220 --> 54:58.860]  Yeah, no, we had in fact film 10.
[55:00.320 --> 55:01.960]  I want to get my video production.
[55:04.680 --> 55:08.740]  Ah, someone who has not filmed that many let's plays and like that short of time.
[55:08.960 --> 55:09.960]  I did Thursday.
[55:10.620 --> 55:11.940]  Oh, man, did I need sleep?
[55:14.500 --> 55:15.920]  I was like, I'm kind of tired.
[55:15.980 --> 55:16.520]  I need sleep.
[55:16.560 --> 55:18.220]  And then just like no amount was enough.
[55:18.760 --> 55:18.920]  Yeah.
[55:18.960 --> 55:21.600]  Eric was saying that he and Nick were talking about that, too, at some point.
[55:22.240 --> 55:28.400]  It's you definitely develop a stamina, I guess, for it.
[55:28.800 --> 55:30.100]  I remember that kind of funny guy.
[55:30.180 --> 55:31.780]  We were doing the whole Let's Play family shit.
[55:31.980 --> 55:34.760]  That kind of funny guys came down and spent like four days with us.
[55:34.780 --> 55:37.720]  And they spent like maybe not four days, like three days with us.
[55:37.720 --> 55:40.060]  But they spent one day in the office just filming all day with us.
[55:40.380 --> 55:43.140]  And at the end, we all went out to dinner and they looked like they'd run a marathon.
[55:43.140 --> 55:48.040]  And Nick and Greg were like, how the fuck do you do this every single day?
[55:48.220 --> 55:51.300]  And all I can think of is like, how doesn't everybody else?
[55:51.300 --> 55:52.420]  This is the most fun.
[55:53.700 --> 55:54.940]  It is really fun.
[55:56.320 --> 56:02.400]  I think the part that's my least fun bit is just the file management once it's done.
[56:02.860 --> 56:05.220]  Like, I can't imagine how that was like for us.
[56:05.260 --> 56:08.420]  It's like we all do our individual files and we upload them somewhere.
[56:08.540 --> 56:11.600]  But for y'all, it must have been like somebody had to go and pull all those
[56:11.600 --> 56:13.980]  and put them somewhere because you were in an office.
[56:14.340 --> 56:14.560]  Oh.
[56:16.480 --> 56:19.600]  Yeah, a lot of people work really hard at that stuff.
[56:19.600 --> 56:21.220]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[56:21.360 --> 56:22.640]  And that is even worse.
[56:22.760 --> 56:22.940]  Yeah.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.460]  Chima and I was very fortunate to have a tremendously talented group of editors
[56:28.460 --> 56:34.980]  and producers behind the scenes pretty much from from day one that were fab.
[56:35.240 --> 56:36.540]  Fantastic at what they did.
[56:36.700 --> 56:38.780]  And I don't know.
[56:38.840 --> 56:39.400]  I miss them all.
[56:40.540 --> 56:42.660]  Unfortunately, yeah, definitely.
[56:43.840 --> 56:46.480]  Oh, oh, except for Larry.
[56:46.520 --> 56:47.060]  I don't miss Larry.
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.020]  I'm kidding.
[56:51.080 --> 56:51.840]  I miss Larry the most.
[56:53.820 --> 56:54.460]  Oh, no.
[56:55.280 --> 56:55.680]  Yes.
[56:56.560 --> 56:58.020]  Oh, I thought I was going to win.
[56:58.120 --> 56:58.840]  And now I'm last.
[57:02.100 --> 57:03.080]  There we go.
[57:03.240 --> 57:04.040]  I like your party ball.
[57:04.840 --> 57:05.520]  Thanks, man.
[57:06.660 --> 57:10.400]  It's the closest I had to like a snack, like an ice cream type thing.
[57:10.900 --> 57:15.740]  Oh, gentlemen, you have those popsicles with like the gummies on the inside.
[57:15.880 --> 57:16.800]  Those are right.
[57:16.940 --> 57:18.540]  What gummies on the inside?
[57:18.540 --> 57:19.580]  Yeah, like what?
[57:19.700 --> 57:20.580]  Wouldn't they be frozen?
[57:20.740 --> 57:22.040]  The gummies when they just be like hard?
[57:22.320 --> 57:24.420]  They are hard, but it was delicious.
[57:24.740 --> 57:26.680]  I think I've never heard of gummies.
[57:27.020 --> 57:31.960]  Oh, it was like they had bugs in the they were gummy bugs in the popsicle.
[57:32.400 --> 57:34.040]  That must have been after my time.
[57:34.180 --> 57:35.880]  That sounds like, yeah, yeah, it does.
[57:35.900 --> 57:36.360]  They were great.
[57:37.700 --> 57:38.560]  Do they? Oh, man.
[57:38.740 --> 57:41.220]  Oh, that's I don't think it was last time you think you had one of those.
[57:41.600 --> 57:44.520]  I'm probably when I was like eight in a while.
[57:45.440 --> 57:45.580]  Yeah.
[57:47.900 --> 57:48.540]  Oh, OK.
[57:49.900 --> 57:54.160]  I think if I could time travel, you would think you'd want to go back and like
[57:54.160 --> 57:56.540]  like if it was relatively easy and inexpensive, right?
[57:56.960 --> 57:59.640]  You would maybe it was time prohibitive.
[57:59.720 --> 58:00.740]  Like you wouldn't want to do it all the time.
[58:00.800 --> 58:04.820]  Like there's some sort of barrier to entry, like how you had to wax up a surfboard or something,
[58:04.920 --> 58:12.080]  you know, but you think you would be like, oh, I want to go see who assassinated Kennedy and stuff.
[58:12.140 --> 58:14.200]  And you'd probably do that for like a month.
[58:14.200 --> 58:19.300]  But pretty soon you'd get sick of knowing the answers to shit or or you just like would have
[58:19.300 --> 58:20.860]  answered everything that you really gave a shit about.
[58:20.980 --> 58:23.000]  And I think mostly you'd go back in time for food.
[58:23.480 --> 58:24.540]  Oh, that's interesting.
[58:25.600 --> 58:30.240]  I think mostly you'd be like, oh, I fucking I like when I was a kid,
[58:31.100 --> 58:32.340]  fudgsicles were different.
[58:33.460 --> 58:35.280]  I don't know how else to say it.
[58:36.820 --> 58:39.540]  You and I went to such different places.
[58:39.800 --> 58:40.880]  Tell me about fudgsicles.
[58:40.880 --> 58:48.960]  Oh, well, fudgsicles were fucking the most amazing thing when I was a kid.
[58:49.080 --> 58:53.780]  And there's something that has happened to the fudgsicle that has made it taste different.
[58:53.900 --> 58:56.560]  I'm sure it's removed some cancer causing element.
[58:56.760 --> 58:57.180]  Probably.
[58:57.500 --> 59:02.340]  But if I could go back in time and just go to a corner store and eat like four of those
[59:02.340 --> 59:06.540]  fudgsicles and then just pop back to right now, I'd probably do that before I would go and see
[59:06.540 --> 59:07.860]  like Cleopatra.
[59:08.760 --> 59:11.760]  It's so funny that you say that because that's what I was going to bring up.
[59:12.020 --> 59:18.240]  I've always I would love to try Seamus Blackley, the original like founder of Xbox,
[59:18.820 --> 59:20.620]  super into like making bread now.
[59:21.080 --> 59:26.720]  And he was part of a group that like went to Egypt and they got all these ancient pots
[59:26.720 --> 59:33.280]  and they got culture from them and they made like a yeast type thing and were making bread
[59:33.280 --> 59:37.300]  in the same way they were back then, like as accurately as you can to modern times.
[59:37.300 --> 59:39.020]  I'd love to taste that.
[59:39.260 --> 59:40.600]  That is so fucking cool.
[59:40.760 --> 59:40.880]  That.
[59:41.200 --> 59:41.940]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[59:42.660 --> 59:43.480]  Also scary.
[59:45.920 --> 59:49.120]  Well, hey, I pull in like old.
[59:49.680 --> 59:50.520]  Oh, yeah.
[59:50.680 --> 59:50.980]  Yeah.
[59:51.040 --> 59:54.820]  Have to make new with just seems like a little bit of a gamble.
[59:55.560 --> 59:57.280]  You unlock some ancient disease.
[59:57.620 --> 59:58.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.440]  Like, oh, this is why they stopped doing this.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.040]  Like there's some enzyme and old spelt or something that.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:05.940]  Oh, man.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:06.260]  Yeah.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.200]  Especially if it's been around that long, too.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.700]  It's like, what is this developed over time?
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.140]  Yeah, it's going to be tough and angry.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.820]  And we just thought it out.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.100]  I wonder if certain things like do you think chicken parm,
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.100]  the first chicken parm is the exact same as like if I got it right?
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.000]  Oh, not a chance.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.280]  No.
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:27.080]  And that's another one, too, right?
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.720]  Great example, Andrew.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:34.040]  Imagine going back to like 1968 and going to the original McDonald's.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.760]  I guarantee you.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.160]  That would be an experience you would fucking cherish
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.100]  for the rest of your time traveling life.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.160]  Just go in there and be like, y'all are going to sell nugget buddies.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.160]  You don't even know.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:46.840]  Yeah.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.120]  And just get like what it tastes like, like the original.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.360]  Like, you know, somewhere there's a there's an original Applebee's
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.660]  that's pretty fucking good
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.440]  because they decided to franchise it and turn it into a thing.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.720]  Going back there when they were at like their prime and getting to eat it,
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.080]  like right when that was about to blow up, you know, going back to Nick,
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.560]  we could go back in time and eat Torchy's before it sucked.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.620]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:12.100]  Remember when Torchy's was amazing quality and fucking full of flavor
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.700]  and delicious yumminess, and now it's dog shit in a can.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.940]  I still enjoy it, but it is not the same.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.660]  Not the same.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:26.800]  I had one that blew my mind recently where I found out the inventor
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.880]  of the California roll has a shop in Vancouver.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.240]  Like he's still working and is active today.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.960]  Like that type of sushi roll just feels like something to be so much older than that.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.620]  The idea that the person who invented it is still making rolls.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.040]  Like you can go talk to him.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:44.940]  Yeah.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.860]  Like he's behind the camera and he'll make you.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:47.700]  Yeah.
[01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:52.350]  Wonder how old that guy is now.
[01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:54.730]  He's definitely older.
[01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:56.810]  I'd say 70s, I'd assume.
[01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:01.430]  First McDonald's would be crazy.
[01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:02.770]  I didn't even think about that.
[01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:03.410]  I didn't either.
[01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:06.450]  Or like historical foods.
[01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:12.510]  There was some YouTuber who does food history stuff.
[01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:14.110]  I know what you're talking about.
[01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:18.010]  Learning about, say, French onion soup.
[01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.630]  It was served out of desperation.
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:23.710]  They were like, what the hell did we get?
[01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:25.710]  I think some Royals were coming somewhere.
[01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:26.090]  Okay.
[01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:32.510]  And they only had like champagne, some cheese, a bunch of onions, loads of Parmesan,
[01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:33.650]  which is the cheese.
[01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:38.250]  And then some, I think maybe a little bit of mozzarella and then bread.
[01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:42.070]  And so it's just like they had to find a way to cook all this stuff together.
[01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:43.870]  And they made this really decadent soup out of it.
[01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:45.910]  But it's made like with a whole bottle of champagne and stuff.
[01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.090]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:48.230]  It's really rich.
[01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:52.430]  And apparently was loved so much that they're like, we...
[01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:58.030]  It became like a new favorite that was served among all these like noble folks.
[01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:00.350]  And then eventually worked its way through time.
[01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:02.350]  And now you can get it at La Madeline.
[01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:04.650]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:11.130]  Or like bananas back before they tasted different.
[01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.650]  You know, like how bananas originally tasted.
[01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.130]  Another one.
[01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:19.390]  I think the time traveling food tourism would be huge.
[01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:20.910]  It would, yeah.
[01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:27.070]  Yeah, if you couldn't, if you couldn't destroy the fabric of reality, I think you got a real,
[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:28.890]  a real tourist.
[01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:33.930]  The consequences of wanting to try the original cook recipe.
[01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:38.290]  It's just going to be a bunch of people from 50 to 100 years in the future,
[01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.570]  standing in line, trying to time jump each other.
[01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:45.190]  You know, people are just like,
[01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:45.650]  Stop, you dickhead.
[01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:48.390]  You know, people always talk about the forbidden whatever.
[01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.610]  It's like, this is the ultimate forbidden food.
[01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:56.910]  All the hipster blogs of like the original pizza wasn't that great.
[01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.350]  Domino's is actually better than the original pizza.
[01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:06.010]  Yeah, I went to, it's like, yeah, yeah, I went to Sicily in 1848 and I'm not blown away.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.020]  Oh, come on.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:13.780]  Oh, nice.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.060]  Tapping in.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.440]  Pop.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.320]  Nice shot.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:21.700]  Thank you.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.340]  There's a place in, I want to say Philadelphia.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.180]  I'll be honest.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:32.080]  Um, I Philadelphia and Boston are the same place to me.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:37.100]  And anytime I visit them, it's all like the histories are so intertwined.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:37.380]  Yeah.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.000]  And so confusing that I can't, I have trouble separating them.
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.140]  So I was on a tour one night at one of those two cities.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.900]  And we part of the tour was we went by this restaurant that was just in this old house.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:52.280]  And the restaurant, the whole shtick of the restaurant was they only served food.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.280]  I think the restaurant had been around since the 1700s.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.200]  And they had the same menu from then.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:05.280]  And they only cooked food that they cooked in like the late 1700s, early 1800s,
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.700]  and only in the same ways.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.480]  So you could and it was supposedly really good.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.820]  And like, I don't know if it's like a Michelin restaurant, but like really fancy and expensive.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.860]  And you could go in and you'd be eating something like what they would eat off of like 1783 menu.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:17.480]  Yeah.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.400]  Oh, wow.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:19.620]  I always thought that was a cool idea.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.680]  But I looked at the menu and I didn't recognize any of that sht.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.000]  Like it's like a whole different world.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:24.660]  Wow.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]  That's really cool, though.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.320]  That is cool.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.500]  Shall we do one last game?
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.160]  Yeah.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:31.980]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.720]  Do one last game.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.500]  I'm bummed that Eric didn't get his internet back, but.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.580]  Yeah, it's too bad.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.220]  Well, that's why you pay your bills.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.280]  You say that and we still haven't.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.460]  Or I guess we just locked up our bank account to make it easier.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.660]  We just it took us a month to get a bank account.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.200]  It's so fucking hard to be a grown up.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.200]  Oh, really?
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:55.720]  It's real.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.740]  Oh, it's annoying.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.180]  Everything's everything's so much more annoying than it needs to be.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.360]  Well, that is very true.
[01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.290]  I like this time of day to stream.
[01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:08.310]  I do, too.
[01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:09.050]  Yeah, it's fun.
[01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.470]  It's nice.
[01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:13.490]  Look, he people are home from work.
[01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:15.530]  I believe some of them.
[01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:16.210]  Ah, damn.
[01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:19.470]  Oh, do you?
[01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:26.310]  Uh, well, I would ask Eric, but he's he's in charge of Twitch, but he's not here.
[01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:28.810]  You're the secretary of Twitch.
[01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:30.210]  Hey, yeah, I'll be secretary.
[01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:37.010]  Do you ever see a like a future where like we just have extra time on a Wednesday and
[01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:38.250]  we just want to stream then?
[01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:39.010]  Are we allowed to?
[01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.810]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.470]  Yeah, totally.
[01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:42.450]  I don't get I don't get in trouble with the president.
[01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:47.210]  If you feel like doing a sloppy Joe stream, Geoff, at like 10 p.m.
[01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:48.830]  your time and you just want to do it.
[01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:49.590]  Feel free.
[01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:50.450]  OK.
[01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:52.070]  That's cool.
[01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:55.890]  I was having a lot of fun before we launched officially and being like, I was going to
[01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.890]  throw sloppy Joe's on and just having people show up and play was awesome.
[01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:01.590]  I didn't even know you were doing that.
[01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:04.470]  Tell me all I ever did was invent it.
[01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:05.430]  I know I listen.
[01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:06.730]  Yeah, I didn't.
[01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:08.170]  I didn't listen.
[01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:08.730]  It's fine.
[01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:11.870]  I told you because I said it made me like thinking.
[01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:16.910]  And this is not a criticism in any way, but the amount of people that we would have to
[01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:21.990]  talk to to do that as a roosterteeth stream and the hoops to go through that.
[01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:25.630]  Like it felt like I was doing something illegal.
[01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:31.410]  Well, and the knowledge that you're making like six people probably work till midnight
[01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:34.330]  on a Friday night and they're all like cool to do it.
[01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:36.770]  But it's like it's still you're like, oh, I hate that.
[01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:40.410]  Yeah, I hate having to like rope up extra people into our bullshit.
[01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:50.670]  Yeah, I missed.
[01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:51.590]  Do that.
[01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:55.990]  Nick wants to do last of us on the hardest difficulty.
[01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:57.410]  Do you want to do that as a stream, Nick?
[01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:59.070]  Or is like like a video series?
[01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:00.350]  Oh, we can do either.
[01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:01.410]  I'm OK.
[01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:03.090]  I just figure out a preference.
[01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:05.730]  Now I can kill off or is it pure single player?
[01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:07.170]  A pure single player.
[01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:08.190]  That's cool.
[01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:09.750]  I've never played it.
[01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:10.650]  A multiplayer.
[01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:11.410]  I think I played.
[01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:12.990]  Yeah, the multiplayer was fun.
[01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:18.410]  Everyone I know that plays the multiplayer absolutely loved it.
[01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:22.990]  Yeah, it was kind of gears like it was a lot of being in cover and.
[01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:28.330]  Like trying to be a little stealthy, it was cool.
[01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:32.130]  It was it was radically different from the actual game, it felt.
[01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:37.710]  The actual game is much more stealthy, and I feel like that one was much more.
[01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:41.070]  While cover based, it was still much more out in the open.
[01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:44.690]  Have you already played the game, Nick?
[01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:47.330]  I have. I played it on the hardest difficulty before, and I love it.
[01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:48.910]  It's very fun to do.
[01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:50.850]  It's because it's so frustrating.
[01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:56.650]  Oh, yeah, I think the best part of that will be just how annoyed I'll get.
[01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:58.110]  That sounds awesome.
[01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:01.310]  I've never I've never seen it played, so it'd be fun to.
[01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:03.010]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.090]  It's really good.
[01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:08.410]  And also, you know, I have the the whatever the latest remaster for it is.
[01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:09.670]  So it looks really good, too.
[01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:10.570]  It's like incredible.
[01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.370]  So I haven't done it on that.
[01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:16.030]  I did it on the original, so maybe it plays different now, too.
[01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.670]  I'm so excited for the new gears.
[01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:21.590]  I think it looks great.
[01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.990]  I'm excited for just about everything, man.
[01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:30.390]  I'm excited for the Starfield update that just came out that I haven't played yet.
[01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:32.790]  Oh, I need to play that soon as I'm done with Doom.
[01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:34.290]  I think I'm going to go back to that.
[01:09:34.730 --> 01:09:37.510]  Got to finish Alan Wake to expansion as well.
[01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:39.090]  Oh, that DLC was so good.
[01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:40.250]  I started it.
[01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:40.830]  I started it.
[01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:45.670]  I think I'm going to be in Fallout and Valheim for a while, probably.
[01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.730]  Oh, nice.
[01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:48.510]  And of course, Riders Republic.
[01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:49.750]  Of course.
[01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:52.190]  Oh, what did I get?
[01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:53.170]  I got cake.
[01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:55.890]  I got even sloppy joes.
[01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:58.130]  This quick, quick cake.
[01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:00.010]  Oh, shimmering catfish.
[01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:06.270]  Well, thank you so much for watching our Twitch stream.
[01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:07.130]  This is a lot of fun.
[01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:07.990]  Thank you.
[01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:09.990]  I'd like to, as you were saying, Geoff,
[01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:13.750]  get into a larger cadence of this when we have time to do it.
[01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:14.930]  I think it'd be a lot of fun.
[01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:18.070]  If you haven't, please check out our Patreon.
[01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:23.090]  I've got a lot of content on there as well as our podcast YouTube channel.
[01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:23.950]  We got Let's Plays.
[01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:28.470]  This will go up as a VOD on Tuesday of the next week.
[01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.730]  That stands for video on demand.
[01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:33.790]  Yeah, it does.
[01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:39.330]  But sometimes you could think of it as video on display because isn't it that as well?
[01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:41.430]  That's a great point.
[01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.850]  Wow.
[01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:42.930]  It could be video on display.
[01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:46.490]  Video on...
[01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.470]  Vote on democracy, maybe?
[01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:49.410]  Vote on.
[01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:51.310]  Hey, everybody, let's vote on democracy.
[01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:52.770]  That's a great point, Andrew.
[01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:54.730]  That's a way to sneak in democracy.
[01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.550]  I like it.
[01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.070]  Let's hear it for democracy.
[01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:03.530]  Everybody, can I get a democracy?
[01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.570]  Yeah, can I get a democracy in the chat?
[01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:11.890]  Anyways, thank you so much for watching.
[01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:15.050]  Have a fantastic rest of your day and weekend.
[01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:16.370]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.810]  Bye.
[01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.510]  Bye.
