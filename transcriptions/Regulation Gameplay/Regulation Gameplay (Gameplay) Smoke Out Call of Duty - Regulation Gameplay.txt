[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  Hello and welcome to a regulation gameplay sort of, sort of a things to do throwback.
[00:06.280 --> 00:10.600]  I had this idea while playing Call of Duty for the 10 billionth hour the other day, wanted
[00:10.600 --> 00:15.660]  to bring you guys in and help me test something. If everyone could tab over to, we need to
[00:15.660 --> 00:20.440]  all be like set up kind of the same. If everybody could tab over to weapons and then go down
[00:20.440 --> 00:25.820]  to a custom loadout you don't use. For instance, I'm number five. I don't care what your primary
[00:25.820 --> 00:26.560]  weapon is.
[00:26.660 --> 00:28.980]  I don't really have a loadout yet. So here we go.
[00:28.980 --> 00:30.100]  Custom loadout three.
[00:30.100 --> 00:33.280]  Don't care what your secondary weapon is. I don't care what your melee weapon is.
[00:33.480 --> 00:33.780]  You don't care.
[00:34.060 --> 00:34.760]  Oh my god.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.620]  You can care a little bit.
[00:36.720 --> 00:39.960]  Put whatever you want to put in there. We're going to, we're going to focus on the stuff
[00:39.960 --> 00:40.540]  below that.
[00:40.700 --> 00:41.620]  Okay. I'm ready.
[00:42.480 --> 00:42.700]  All right.
[00:43.300 --> 00:44.380]  Okay. I'm ready.
[00:45.380 --> 00:49.900]  Under tactical, everybody should be able to select smoke grenade.
[00:50.280 --> 00:50.560]  Okay.
[00:50.880 --> 00:51.280]  Got it.
[00:51.480 --> 00:51.500]  Stim shot.
[00:51.920 --> 00:52.460]  Got it.
[00:52.520 --> 00:52.980]  Everybody got it?
[00:52.980 --> 00:54.320]  Smoke grenade. Got it.
[00:54.680 --> 00:55.760]  Lethal, don't give a shit.
[00:56.100 --> 00:56.200]  What?
[00:56.200 --> 00:56.900]  Okay.
[00:56.900 --> 00:57.460]  Under field upgrade.
[00:57.820 --> 00:57.980]  Okay.
[00:58.760 --> 01:00.780]  The defaults probably assault pack.
[01:00.880 --> 01:01.200]  Yeah.
[01:01.700 --> 01:02.000]  All right.
[01:02.060 --> 01:03.420]  This is why we want assault pack.
[01:03.740 --> 01:09.540]  Assault pack allows you, uh, whenever you fill up your, um, your field upgrade bar, probably
[01:09.540 --> 01:12.520]  two to three times a match, you can deploy it.
[01:12.600 --> 01:13.600]  Whatever that field upgrade is.
[01:13.700 --> 01:19.360]  In this instance, it's a little bag, kind of like in, uh, kind of like in, uh, siege
[01:19.360 --> 01:21.080]  where you can go and reload your shit.
[01:21.080 --> 01:22.700]  So you can get more ammo.
[01:22.700 --> 01:26.520]  You can get one more tactical grenade and one more lethal grenade.
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.880]  So I think it works once per life.
[01:29.180 --> 01:33.180]  So if I drop down my field upgrade, everybody can reload their smoke grenade once from it.
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.800]  So that's an additional five new smoke grenades for everybody's field upgrade.
[01:37.860 --> 01:39.040]  So whenever you get it, drop it.
[01:39.240 --> 01:40.500]  Now we're going to go down to the perks.
[01:40.580 --> 01:42.380]  We're going to want to go to perk number three.
[01:42.680 --> 01:42.880]  Okay.
[01:43.360 --> 01:45.780]  And I hope you can select quartermaster.
[01:46.700 --> 01:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:47.080 --> 01:47.300]  Already there.
[01:47.400 --> 01:47.800]  Got it.
[01:48.360 --> 01:49.540]  Yeah, quartermaster's already the one.
[01:49.780 --> 01:51.300]  Recharge equipment uses over time.
[01:51.300 --> 01:56.920]  That means you can recharge your smoke grenade slowly over time.
[01:57.080 --> 02:00.920]  Also, we want, I think there's, oh, if you go down to wild card.
[02:01.220 --> 02:01.340]  Yeah.
[02:01.900 --> 02:02.300]  Yeah.
[02:02.300 --> 02:05.160]  If you guys have access, can you pick tactical expert?
[02:05.320 --> 02:06.060]  That's all I have.
[02:06.240 --> 02:06.760]  All right.
[02:06.780 --> 02:07.060]  Perfect.
[02:07.380 --> 02:10.140]  That allows you to have two tacticals, right?
[02:10.620 --> 02:10.860]  Okay.
[02:10.920 --> 02:12.200]  So everybody should have two.
[02:12.700 --> 02:14.960]  I feel like you should have three, but I only have two smoke grenades.
[02:15.060 --> 02:16.820]  So we should have whatever our gun is.
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.560]  I'm using a shotgun.
[02:19.200 --> 02:22.440]  We should have a two smoke grenade tactical or a tactical plus two.
[02:22.580 --> 02:24.520]  We should have a salt pack and we should have quartermaster.
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.480]  If we have all those things, we should be ready to go.
[02:26.780 --> 02:27.300]  I'm ready.
[02:27.680 --> 02:28.880]  I think we're good.
[02:29.000 --> 02:29.420]  I think I'm good.
[02:29.420 --> 02:29.620]  I think I'm good.
[02:30.200 --> 02:31.420]  So this is the loadout.
[02:31.740 --> 02:37.380]  If you want to do this also, this is your loadout and this is loadout five and we're
[02:37.380 --> 02:37.620]  good.
[02:37.700 --> 02:42.320]  I believe is going to allow us to do is have the most smoke grenades we could possibly
[02:42.320 --> 02:43.880]  have in Call of Duty multiplayer.
[02:44.100 --> 02:44.260]  Okay.
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.260]  Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take us to a map called stakeout.
[02:48.260 --> 02:50.560]  It is the smallest map in the game.
[02:50.720 --> 02:52.380]  I believe it's all indoors.
[02:52.800 --> 02:55.900]  I discovered this the other day when I was playing small stakeout.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.020]  I was getting mastery and all the different equipment in the game and I never use smoke
[03:00.020 --> 03:02.640]  grenades because they're useless, but and they're annoying.
[03:02.760 --> 03:03.420]  You throw a smoke grenade.
[03:03.540 --> 03:04.500]  It lasts forever.
[03:04.860 --> 03:10.240]  And I noticed you can cover half the map by yourself in stakeout pretty quickly with smoke
[03:10.240 --> 03:10.980]  grenades if you want to.
[03:11.200 --> 03:15.680]  I figure with the five of us together, we can smoke out this entire fucking map, the
[03:15.680 --> 03:17.180]  entire game.
[03:17.180 --> 03:20.440]  The second you die, you respawn and you have all your shit back.
[03:20.500 --> 03:21.500]  You can drop more smoke grenades.
[03:21.740 --> 03:25.700]  The goal here is nobody sees anything for the next nine minutes.
[03:25.920 --> 03:26.320]  Hell yeah!
[03:26.920 --> 03:27.480]  Let's do it.
[03:27.520 --> 03:30.360]  This is going to be the best worst video I think we've ever made.
[03:30.520 --> 03:31.220]  This rocks.
[03:31.420 --> 03:32.500]  Welcome to Call of Duty.
[03:32.980 --> 03:34.080]  The smoke out.
[03:34.400 --> 03:36.640]  We for 2069 the whole deal.
[03:36.880 --> 03:38.260]  Smoke them if you got them.
[03:38.400 --> 03:44.740]  Somebody do an edit where we're doing cool like 360 no scopes, but it's so smoky you can't
[03:44.740 --> 03:45.740]  see any of it.
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.700]  This is going to rock.
[03:47.280 --> 03:47.920]  I'm excited.
[03:48.340 --> 03:50.700]  You've been excited about this idea for a while now, Geoff.
[03:50.840 --> 03:51.840]  I'm very excited.
[03:51.980 --> 03:55.480]  I had this idea the other night when I was playing at like two in the morning and then
[03:55.480 --> 03:58.860]  some guy who was just randomly playing with me saw me throwing smoke and he started throwing
[03:58.860 --> 03:59.300]  smoke too.
[03:59.380 --> 04:02.060]  I don't know if he was trying to help me get something or if he just thought it was funny.
[04:02.380 --> 04:05.980]  But between the two of us, we ruined the game and I was thinking, oh, we're going to ruin
[04:05.980 --> 04:06.500]  this one.
[04:06.860 --> 04:07.020]  Yeah.
[04:07.120 --> 04:09.500]  And I practiced it a little bit last night about 1 a.m.
[04:09.740 --> 04:10.820]  Working fine by myself.
[04:10.880 --> 04:14.420]  So I think I think the only way this could be better is if we had a sixth person on our
[04:14.420 --> 04:14.600]  team.
[04:14.660 --> 04:15.300]  Yeah, that's OK.
[04:15.300 --> 04:16.640]  We're a five person company.
[04:16.640 --> 04:17.820]  We're going to make we're going to make it.
[04:18.340 --> 04:20.560]  I voted for face off team deathmatch.
[04:20.840 --> 04:21.380]  That's fine.
[04:21.660 --> 04:23.000]  It doesn't matter as long as we're on this map.
[04:23.360 --> 04:23.440]  Cool.
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.720]  Team team deathmatch is nice because it's just chaos.
[04:25.780 --> 04:25.960]  Right.
[04:26.160 --> 04:26.360]  Yeah.
[04:26.620 --> 04:31.100]  So basically what we want to do is we land left bumper is our tactical grenade, start
[04:31.100 --> 04:36.120]  popping smoke and just, you know, have fun.
[04:36.120 --> 04:39.980]  Should I even try to kill people or is my goal just if you want to, if you want to.
[04:40.060 --> 04:40.300]  Sure.
[04:40.400 --> 04:41.240]  You're not going to see shit.
[04:41.260 --> 04:41.860]  But if you want to.
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.680]  I hope we're on a team with Torta Pounder 71.
[04:45.340 --> 04:48.960]  Maybe if this works well, we'll come back in with thermal scopes.
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.300]  Oh, now we're talking.
[04:52.460 --> 04:54.540]  And then it'll just be like shooting fish in a bag.
[04:54.900 --> 04:55.220]  Yeah.
[04:55.340 --> 04:57.000]  Oh, it's just the five of us.
[04:57.420 --> 04:58.440]  That's awesome.
[05:00.240 --> 05:01.580]  They don't know what's coming.
[05:02.300 --> 05:02.760]  Oh, fuck.
[05:02.880 --> 05:04.500]  I picked the wrong way to go.
[05:04.660 --> 05:05.560]  Good job.
[05:06.020 --> 05:06.840]  Way to go, man.
[05:07.040 --> 05:08.240]  Make sure you pick the correct loadout.
[05:08.340 --> 05:08.420]  Yeah.
[05:08.440 --> 05:09.500]  Why am I so small?
[05:10.100 --> 05:11.520]  Oh, I was crouched.
[05:12.440 --> 05:13.100]  All right.
[05:13.240 --> 05:14.340]  Oh, my God.
[05:14.600 --> 05:15.660]  This is insane.
[05:16.620 --> 05:18.140]  Everybody pop smoke out.
[05:19.100 --> 05:19.540]  Smoke out.
[05:19.880 --> 05:21.600]  As soon as you die, pop more smoke.
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.000]  Smoke out.
[05:24.240 --> 05:24.440]  Smoke out.
[05:25.100 --> 05:25.700]  Oh, God.
[05:31.800 --> 05:34.040]  I can't see a goddamn fire.
[05:35.540 --> 05:36.000]  I don't know.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.920]  If you live long enough, your smoke comes out.
[05:37.980 --> 05:40.080]  You can see the blue and white progress bar above you.
[05:40.080 --> 05:42.180]  Dude, this rocks.
[05:42.680 --> 05:43.580]  Smoke out.
[05:43.860 --> 05:44.820]  You smoked me.
[05:44.940 --> 05:45.860]  It's the room I spawned in.
[05:45.880 --> 05:46.420]  Oh, no.
[05:46.980 --> 05:47.600]  Smoke out.
[05:48.040 --> 05:48.360]  Smoke out.
[05:48.520 --> 05:48.920]  Smoke out.
[05:49.680 --> 05:51.040]  Bunkers the clown got me.
[05:53.620 --> 05:54.200]  I got a smoke.
[05:54.240 --> 05:55.280]  This is blind firing.
[05:55.660 --> 05:58.220]  This is the craziest.
[05:59.220 --> 06:01.740]  Geoff, Geoff, this idea rocks.
[06:02.240 --> 06:02.460]  Thank you.
[06:02.560 --> 06:03.000]  Smoke out.
[06:03.120 --> 06:03.800]  Smoke out.
[06:04.220 --> 06:06.720]  I can't wait to grow a new smoke grenade.
[06:06.960 --> 06:07.600]  Smoke out.
[06:10.080 --> 06:11.740]  Where are they?
[06:12.200 --> 06:12.880]  Smoke out.
[06:13.100 --> 06:13.940]  They're in the hallway.
[06:14.100 --> 06:14.780]  We need more smoke.
[06:15.120 --> 06:15.420]  Smoke out.
[06:15.580 --> 06:16.100]  Smoke out.
[06:16.760 --> 06:18.880]  Dave, Stake, and I were in a room the entire time.
[06:18.920 --> 06:19.880]  We didn't even see each other.
[06:20.460 --> 06:22.100]  I'm just dying left and right.
[06:22.440 --> 06:22.940]  I've got...
[06:22.940 --> 06:23.940]  I got a kill.
[06:24.380 --> 06:24.560]  Oh, shit.
[06:25.840 --> 06:27.120]  They got me before the smoke went off.
[06:27.520 --> 06:28.260]  Oh, no.
[06:31.040 --> 06:31.740]  Smoke out.
[06:31.800 --> 06:32.140]  Smoke out.
[06:32.640 --> 06:33.980]  Smoke out.
[06:34.240 --> 06:36.540]  I can't see where I am.
[06:38.380 --> 06:39.400]  Okay, I got equipment.
[06:39.940 --> 06:40.600]  Smoke out.
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.320]  Smoke out.
[06:44.160 --> 06:45.520]  I'm on the wooden floor.
[06:45.740 --> 06:46.200]  How do I close...
[06:47.080 --> 06:48.560]  How do I close the external door?
[06:50.300 --> 06:51.100]  Smoke out.
[06:51.340 --> 06:51.520]  Oh, shit.
[06:51.980 --> 06:54.700]  Everybody, don't forget to drop your field upgrade.
[06:54.840 --> 06:56.280]  When you get it, you can get more smoke.
[06:56.460 --> 06:57.720]  Oh, yeah. Field upgrade out.
[06:58.240 --> 06:58.820]  Smoke out.
[07:02.760 --> 07:03.500]  I'm getting my ass kicked.
[07:03.500 --> 07:05.480]  Anytime you see the prompt, because you can't see shit.
[07:05.580 --> 07:08.320]  Anytime you see the prompt to refill equipment, that's how you get more smoke.
[07:08.540 --> 07:09.180]  Smoke out.
[07:09.180 --> 07:10.780]  They just...
[07:11.820 --> 07:13.920]  They were coming to the room, and now they can't see shit.
[07:14.080 --> 07:14.480]  I killed them.
[07:15.260 --> 07:15.740]  Smoke out.
[07:17.560 --> 07:18.760]  Hang on. Back down.
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.480]  Someone throw down a grow bag.
[07:20.620 --> 07:21.280]  Smoke out.
[07:21.400 --> 07:21.920]  Smoke out.
[07:22.640 --> 07:23.920]  Oh, yeah. Smoke...
[07:24.680 --> 07:25.180]  Smoke out.
[07:25.200 --> 07:25.780]  Smoke out.
[07:26.480 --> 07:26.880]  Fire.
[07:27.800 --> 07:28.280]  Grenade out.
[07:28.360 --> 07:31.880]  Remember what they say. When in doubt, smoke out.
[07:32.100 --> 07:32.540]  Smoke out.
[07:32.620 --> 07:34.360]  Dude, we're so fucking annoying.
[07:35.440 --> 07:37.240]  Hey, pass the dutchie, boys.
[07:38.220 --> 07:39.020]  Smoke out.
[07:44.840 --> 07:45.600]  Smoke out.
[07:45.900 --> 07:46.780]  Smoke out.
[07:47.200 --> 07:47.680]  Smoke out.
[07:47.680 --> 07:48.040]  Smoke out.
[07:48.040 --> 07:48.320]  Regular grenade.
[07:50.440 --> 07:51.940]  Oh, this would be so annoying.
[07:52.360 --> 07:52.780]  That's so annoying.
[07:53.140 --> 07:53.520]  That's so annoying.
[07:53.680 --> 07:55.320]  Has someone got a bag? I've run out of smoke.
[07:55.660 --> 07:56.520]  I do. I do.
[07:56.780 --> 07:57.520]  Oh, nice.
[07:57.960 --> 07:58.560]  Smoke out.
[07:58.760 --> 07:59.580]  Oh, God.
[07:59.820 --> 08:00.740]  Someone almost got someone through the smoke.
[08:00.960 --> 08:01.400]  Smoke out.
[08:01.600 --> 08:02.200]  Smoke out.
[08:02.680 --> 08:04.360]  I don't want to be able to see anything at any point.
[08:04.720 --> 08:04.820]  Smoke out.
[08:04.840 --> 08:05.360]  Smoke out.
[08:05.560 --> 08:06.560]  Regular grenade out.
[08:06.640 --> 08:08.020]  I got someone through the smoke.
[08:08.020 --> 08:11.560]  I'm just crawling through the smoke.
[08:11.920 --> 08:14.440]  What is happening? I can't see anything.
[08:14.960 --> 08:18.260]  This is absolutely the only way I ever want to play this game.
[08:18.980 --> 08:21.420]  If Call of Duty sucks, this rocks.
[08:21.940 --> 08:24.640]  I dropped my equipment package on the ground, so...
[08:24.640 --> 08:26.760]  Guys, I just want to play my new favorite game.
[08:27.120 --> 08:27.460]  Smoke out.
[08:27.700 --> 08:28.220]  Smoke out.
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.520]  It's in the kitchen. Yeah, it's down here somewhere.
[08:30.520 --> 08:30.900]  Smoke out.
[08:31.000 --> 08:31.680]  Smoke out.
[08:32.500 --> 08:34.180]  I can't see the kitchen. Is this the kitchen?
[08:34.580 --> 08:34.760]  You can smoke out.
[08:34.760 --> 08:36.760]  You can get up on the D-pad.
[08:38.120 --> 08:40.040]  Person, person, person.
[08:40.800 --> 08:41.440]  Smoke out.
[08:41.460 --> 08:42.440]  Smoke out.
[08:42.520 --> 08:43.420]  Smoke out.
[08:44.260 --> 08:45.460]  I'm shooting this guy's knees.
[08:46.180 --> 08:47.140]  Smoke out.
[08:47.340 --> 08:48.020]  Smoke out.
[08:48.380 --> 08:49.440]  Alright, I'm spawning back in.
[08:49.480 --> 08:50.080]  Smoke out.
[08:50.360 --> 08:50.920]  Smoke out.
[08:52.420 --> 08:53.020]  Smoke out.
[08:54.460 --> 08:55.220]  Smoke out.
[08:55.420 --> 08:57.060]  I'm green. I'm at level six.
[08:58.680 --> 08:59.720]  I'm gonna...
[09:01.320 --> 09:03.360]  The game can't render it good.
[09:03.540 --> 09:04.280]  It's all flushing.
[09:06.240 --> 09:06.960]  Smoke out.
[09:08.520 --> 09:10.240]  Get back in the spot.
[09:10.680 --> 09:11.240]  Smoke out.
[09:14.540 --> 09:16.340]  I spawned and I can see it.
[09:16.680 --> 09:18.420]  In one second, it was all gone.
[09:18.680 --> 09:19.080]  Smoke out.
[09:23.040 --> 09:24.080]  Smoke out.
[09:24.480 --> 09:25.200]  I'm putting down a bag.
[09:25.620 --> 09:26.120]  Smoke out.
[09:26.420 --> 09:26.880]  Smoke out.
[09:27.200 --> 09:28.040]  Smoke out.
[09:29.260 --> 09:29.880]  Smoke out.
[09:31.700 --> 09:32.740]  Smoke out.
[09:33.260 --> 09:34.220]  I hit him in the tit with a smoke.
[09:34.220 --> 09:35.560]  I'm putting down a bag.
[09:36.180 --> 09:37.760]  Why is everything on fire?
[09:38.260 --> 09:38.660]  Grenade.
[09:38.840 --> 09:39.240]  Get low.
[09:39.380 --> 09:40.360]  People are throwing fire.
[09:40.540 --> 09:41.340]  Crawl through the smoke.
[09:42.340 --> 09:42.940]  Smoke out.
[09:43.540 --> 09:44.720]  I fell to my death.
[09:44.860 --> 09:45.900]  I didn't know there was a ledge.
[09:46.400 --> 09:46.900]  Smoke out.
[09:47.480 --> 09:48.960]  You can't see him because of all the smoke.
[09:49.060 --> 09:49.960]  Yeah, smoke out.
[09:51.380 --> 09:52.460]  That was brutal.
[09:52.600 --> 09:54.560]  Should we make a shirt that just says smoke out?
[09:54.880 --> 09:55.640]  Dude, I...
[09:56.220 --> 09:57.640]  We're gonna make a bunch of money.
[09:59.480 --> 10:01.800]  We just developed a new game title.
[10:01.940 --> 10:02.200]  Smoke out.
[10:02.400 --> 10:03.480]  Get in the bathroom.
[10:03.480 --> 10:05.280]  Alright, I'm dropping my ammo.
[10:06.080 --> 10:06.260]  Smoke out.
[10:06.260 --> 10:06.840]  Everybody reload.
[10:08.080 --> 10:08.440]  Oh my god.
[10:08.440 --> 10:09.400]  Smoke him if you got him.
[10:09.940 --> 10:10.680]  Smoke out.
[10:11.260 --> 10:12.000]  Smoke out.
[10:12.180 --> 10:12.560]  Smoke out.
[10:12.860 --> 10:13.540]  Smoke out.
[10:13.900 --> 10:15.440]  They threw fire in the bathroom.
[10:15.620 --> 10:15.940]  Ah, fuck.
[10:18.680 --> 10:19.700]  Turn the water on.
[10:19.820 --> 10:20.500]  Smoke out.
[10:20.860 --> 10:21.960]  What kind of spawn was that?
[10:22.860 --> 10:23.580]  Smoke out.
[10:25.180 --> 10:26.000]  Smoke out.
[10:26.880 --> 10:27.660]  Smoke out.
[10:28.040 --> 10:28.420]  Fuck.
[10:28.500 --> 10:29.540]  That was a lot of smoke, boys.
[10:30.720 --> 10:32.040]  I spawned to death.
[10:32.640 --> 10:34.380]  Could you re-cam games in this?
[10:34.520 --> 10:35.300]  Could you like do save?
[10:35.560 --> 10:36.320]  Yes, you can.
[10:36.620 --> 10:37.040]  Smoke out.
[10:37.220 --> 10:37.520]  Hell yeah.
[10:37.800 --> 10:38.380]  Smoke out.
[10:38.580 --> 10:42.000]  This is the craziest way to play this.
[10:42.400 --> 10:42.960]  I got you, Andrew.
[10:43.580 --> 10:44.800]  I got you, guys.
[10:45.440 --> 10:47.740]  You guys are helping me realize a dream.
[10:48.040 --> 10:50.980]  I've been thinking about this non-stop for like five days.
[10:51.020 --> 10:53.460]  I can't wait to throw in some thermals.
[10:53.900 --> 10:56.900]  I can't fucking tell anything is happening.
[10:56.900 --> 10:57.560]  I can't see.
[10:57.860 --> 10:59.740]  I can't see shit.
[11:00.020 --> 11:01.080]  I have no fucking clue.
[11:02.740 --> 11:05.880]  The kill cam was looking through the smoke with a thermoscope.
[11:10.020 --> 11:11.540]  We almost had it, boys.
[11:11.880 --> 11:13.460]  Did we lose or did we win?
[11:14.440 --> 11:14.500]  58.
[11:14.680 --> 11:16.200]  58 is where we have to beat.
[11:16.360 --> 11:16.940]  Oh my god.
[11:17.180 --> 11:17.800]  How do I say GG?
[11:19.640 --> 11:21.020]  I think you can actually.
[11:21.020 --> 11:22.320]  Oh, you look so cool running through the smoke.
[11:24.800 --> 11:25.540]  Oh my god.
[11:27.800 --> 11:29.200]  Good job, Kid King.
[11:29.820 --> 11:30.260]  Wow.
[11:30.900 --> 11:31.300]  Oh.
[11:32.560 --> 11:32.960]  Whoa.
[11:33.720 --> 11:35.860]  Do you guys want to try this one more time?
[11:36.120 --> 11:38.540]  I want to do this for an hour.
[11:38.740 --> 11:39.880]  Yeah, I want to change my...
[11:39.880 --> 11:41.320]  I only want to do this.
[11:41.460 --> 11:42.560]  I want to put a thermoscope on.
[11:42.780 --> 11:43.060]  Oh, yeah.
[11:43.140 --> 11:44.460]  We need to do thermoscopes.
[11:44.800 --> 11:46.560]  Yeah, anybody that has a thermoscope, go ahead and grab it.
[11:46.800 --> 11:47.920]  Oh my god.
[11:48.160 --> 11:48.980]  This rocks.
[11:49.080 --> 11:49.760]  That was awesome.
[11:50.220 --> 11:51.400]  This is so cool.
[11:51.540 --> 11:51.860]  Oh, I got a headache.
[11:51.860 --> 11:52.920]  What a great idea.
[11:53.260 --> 11:53.800]  So much fun.
[11:54.280 --> 11:54.400]  Jesus.
[11:56.320 --> 11:59.000]  Just run around screaming smoke out for 10 minutes.
[11:59.040 --> 11:59.420]  That was good.
[12:00.080 --> 12:00.240]  That was good.
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.840]  That was the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
[12:03.080 --> 12:05.680]  Kill an enemy with the direct impact of smoke.
[12:05.740 --> 12:06.460]  Alright, hang on.
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.820]  Let me see.
[12:08.860 --> 12:09.200]  What is it?
[12:09.260 --> 12:09.560]  Gunsmith?
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.180]  Yeah, let me choose my loadout.
[12:12.260 --> 12:14.140]  I must have a gun that has...
[12:14.140 --> 12:14.880]  Leave with party.
[12:15.020 --> 12:15.940]  Okay, that way we can save time.
[12:17.280 --> 12:18.040]  Do I have...
[12:19.300 --> 12:20.280]  What would it be under?
[12:21.520 --> 12:21.880]  Optic?
[12:22.040 --> 12:23.700]  So, it would be under optic.
[12:24.500 --> 12:26.500]  I guess I should pick a gun that I've got high level in.
[12:26.960 --> 12:27.240]  Yeah.
[12:27.240 --> 12:30.220]  And you're going to want the...
[12:31.340 --> 12:32.160]  What is the gun?
[12:32.220 --> 12:35.900]  It's going to be probably the K&S Thermal Hollow.
[12:36.660 --> 12:37.620]  What gun is that one?
[12:38.240 --> 12:39.260]  Yeah, what gun is it?
[12:39.260 --> 12:39.800]  Is it any of them?
[12:39.820 --> 12:41.020]  I have it on a shotgun.
[12:41.400 --> 12:41.800]  Oh, okay.
[12:42.660 --> 12:45.320]  Oh, so it's like a thing we have to unlock?
[12:45.940 --> 12:46.280]  Yeah.
[12:47.040 --> 12:50.640]  I don't know when it's unlocked.
[12:51.100 --> 12:53.560]  Based on where it is in the optics list, pretty far down.
[12:53.840 --> 12:54.240]  Is it?
[12:55.180 --> 12:55.820]  Yeah, it's at the bottom.
[12:56.460 --> 12:57.500]  Oh my god.
[12:57.740 --> 13:03.480]  I feel like optics are one of those things where if you unlock it, it's unlocked across all.
[13:03.900 --> 13:04.620]  Weapon level...
[13:06.560 --> 13:07.480]  Wow, okay.
[13:07.840 --> 13:08.280]  So, yeah.
[13:08.720 --> 13:10.620]  Yeah, we'll unlock that at...
[13:11.540 --> 13:14.240]  Unlock at GPR 91 level 15.
[13:14.440 --> 13:14.820]  Oh, okay.
[13:14.820 --> 13:15.440]  Yeah, sure.
[13:15.660 --> 13:18.280]  So, do you have level 15 in any other gun then?
[13:18.600 --> 13:19.400]  I don't have...
[13:19.400 --> 13:21.560]  I have level 5 on one gun.
[13:21.940 --> 13:24.000]  Oh, I have it on a LMG, so I'm good.
[13:24.700 --> 13:25.320]  There you go.
[13:26.420 --> 13:27.020]  Okay.
[13:27.460 --> 13:28.980]  Okay, I'm ready.
[13:29.300 --> 13:30.260]  Let's do this.
[13:30.380 --> 13:31.600]  Yeah, let's...
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.780]  Let's go ahead and smoke out another group of unsuspecting loser gamer idiots.
[13:37.480 --> 13:39.160]  Dude, this is...
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.340]  Geoff, this was such a hassle.
[13:41.500 --> 13:42.260]  People don't know.
[13:42.800 --> 13:51.220]  Us trying to get into this game was looking up these glitches that there was like a problem and all this stuff and...
[13:51.220 --> 14:02.880]  For the record, all we're trying to do is have five friends play a multiplayer game together on the same console, on the same day, with the same version of the game.
[14:03.120 --> 14:04.600]  But because...
[14:06.320 --> 14:06.760]  Domination...
[14:06.760 --> 14:09.780]  Let's all pick Kill Confirmed, if you wouldn't mind.
[14:10.020 --> 14:12.200]  Domination's just gonna be like controlling points on the map.
[14:12.400 --> 14:13.760]  Oh, yeah, then Kill Confirmed is good.
[14:14.140 --> 14:14.280]  Cool.
[14:14.620 --> 14:15.820]  And it's the fucking...
[14:15.820 --> 14:18.040]  I know we bitch about it constantly, but I have...
[14:18.040 --> 14:20.020]  Gavin and I have decades of PTSD with this shit.
[14:20.020 --> 14:22.420]  It's just never... stuff just doesn't work.
[14:22.640 --> 14:22.760]  Yep.
[14:23.720 --> 14:24.040]  Crazy.
[14:24.840 --> 14:25.160]  Crazy.
[14:25.260 --> 14:26.720]  We probably spent...
[14:26.720 --> 14:27.660]  No, I know how long we spent.
[14:27.720 --> 14:31.660]  We spent about 35 minutes all trying to get in the game together.
[14:31.740 --> 14:31.840]  Yep.
[14:32.180 --> 14:35.000]  Even though we all had the same version, one of us didn't have the right version.
[14:35.780 --> 14:35.920]  Yeah.
[14:36.300 --> 14:37.900]  Or two of us didn't, even though they did.
[14:38.160 --> 14:41.380]  And then, Gavin, you were saying that you had that same problem the other day.
[14:41.540 --> 14:44.500]  And that's the only reason we knew it was a thing that other people were having an issue with.
[14:44.500 --> 14:45.960]  Yeah, I had to reinstall the game.
[14:46.720 --> 14:47.040]  Insane.
[14:47.460 --> 14:50.400]  Andrew had to uninstall and reinstall the multiplayer version.
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.800]  It seemed to be a glitch that started with Season 2 of whatever the fuck this is.
[14:54.860 --> 14:55.040]  Yep.
[14:55.320 --> 14:57.500]  Season 2 Battle Pass just came out this week, so yeah.
[14:57.500 --> 14:57.780]  Alright!
[14:58.200 --> 14:59.260]  Smoke em if you can, Gavin!
[14:59.500 --> 15:01.140]  Smoke em if you can, Gavin!
[15:01.340 --> 15:01.400]  Smoke out!
[15:02.420 --> 15:05.140]  Oh, dude, I can see all the way through, it's amazing!
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.580]  Guys, I can't see shit!
[15:07.800 --> 15:08.400]  I can't see either.
[15:08.480 --> 15:08.960]  Smoke out!
[15:10.560 --> 15:11.360]  Smoke out!
[15:13.200 --> 15:13.940]  There's an enemy!
[15:14.360 --> 15:14.760]  Smoke out!
[15:14.760 --> 15:15.460]  There's an enemy!
[15:15.460 --> 15:16.020]  Fuck!
[15:17.420 --> 15:19.180]  Oh, he got me!
[15:19.720 --> 15:20.400]  Smoke out!
[15:20.680 --> 15:20.960]  Smoke out!
[15:21.440 --> 15:21.960]  Smoke out!
[15:22.440 --> 15:22.560]  Smoke out!
[15:22.700 --> 15:23.540]  Smoke out!
[15:23.980 --> 15:25.100]  Blind shotgun fire!
[15:25.740 --> 15:26.740]  Blind shotgun fire!
[15:27.960 --> 15:28.360]  Grenade!
[15:28.720 --> 15:29.120]  Grenade!
[15:30.860 --> 15:33.260]  Guys, grenades are showing up kinda high on the scope.
[15:34.920 --> 15:37.420]  Blind grenades are fuckin' insane.
[15:37.540 --> 15:37.940]  Insane.
[15:38.040 --> 15:38.960]  Oh shit, we're out of smoke!
[15:39.640 --> 15:40.300]  We're out of smoke!
[15:40.480 --> 15:40.980]  We're out of smoke!
[15:41.100 --> 15:41.560]  Out of smoke!
[15:41.760 --> 15:42.580]  Shoot out the window!
[15:42.840 --> 15:43.240]  Or the door!
[15:43.260 --> 15:44.280]  I got one coming in hot!
[15:44.280 --> 15:47.780]  If you need smoke bad, you can jump out the window, you'll respawn with smoke.
[15:47.960 --> 15:48.040]  Smoke!
[15:48.040 --> 15:49.460]  You ran past me, you didn't even see me.
[15:49.680 --> 15:50.860]  Oh, they threw a smoke, that's great.
[15:50.860 --> 15:50.920]  Smoke's out!
[15:51.580 --> 15:52.220]  I'm out of ammo!
[15:52.340 --> 15:54.080]  There's a bunch of people in the smoke, thanks for throwing the smoke!
[15:54.560 --> 15:55.120]  Smoke's out!
[15:57.520 --> 15:58.420]  Double kill, alright.
[15:58.920 --> 16:00.040]  I keep shooting my teammates.
[16:00.580 --> 16:00.900]  That's me!
[16:01.040 --> 16:01.480]  Smoke out!
[16:03.000 --> 16:03.460]  Smoke grenade!
[16:09.290 --> 16:10.490]  What the fuck happened to you?
[16:10.750 --> 16:11.290]  Smoke out!
[16:12.050 --> 16:12.610]  I need more smoke!
[16:12.770 --> 16:13.430]  Need more smoke!
[16:13.450 --> 16:13.830]  Smoke out!
[16:15.030 --> 16:17.090]  Gonna run low on smoke here, boys.
[16:17.090 --> 16:17.930]  Low on smoke!
[16:18.010 --> 16:18.990]  Shot his ankles!
[16:20.870 --> 16:21.470]  Smoke out!
[16:21.590 --> 16:22.010]  Smoke out!
[16:22.470 --> 16:23.130]  Smoke out!
[16:23.270 --> 16:23.930]  Smoke out!
[16:25.350 --> 16:25.910]  Grenade!
[16:26.450 --> 16:26.990]  Smoke out!
[16:28.370 --> 16:29.630]  Guys, on top of me!
[16:31.330 --> 16:32.050]  Smoke out!
[16:34.710 --> 16:35.190]  Smoke out!
[16:39.690 --> 16:40.570]  Dropping ammo!
[16:40.710 --> 16:41.230]  Smoke out!
[16:41.610 --> 16:42.290]  Smoke out!
[16:42.410 --> 16:42.990]  Smoke out!
[16:44.570 --> 16:46.190]  Oh, someone shut the door!
[16:46.210 --> 16:46.770]  Smoke!
[16:47.990 --> 16:48.950]  I refilled!
[16:49.130 --> 16:49.510]  Smoke out!
[16:49.630 --> 16:50.390]  Smoke out!
[16:53.990 --> 16:55.110]  Smoke out!
[16:55.330 --> 16:55.990]  Smoke out!
[16:56.710 --> 16:57.590]  That's a hot kitchen!
[16:58.210 --> 16:58.810]  Smoke out!
[16:59.170 --> 17:00.350]  I crawl right into it!
[17:00.590 --> 17:00.650]  Smoke out!
[17:02.590 --> 17:03.430]  Smoke out!
[17:06.250 --> 17:06.690]  Smoke!
[17:07.070 --> 17:07.910]  Smoke out!
[17:08.170 --> 17:09.830]  I just watched Mike go to the moon!
[17:12.510 --> 17:13.530]  Grenade out!
[17:16.270 --> 17:17.630]  Smoke out!
[17:18.430 --> 17:19.070]  Smoke out!
[17:20.830 --> 17:21.130]  Smoke out!
[17:22.610 --> 17:25.030]  That was so annoying, oh my god.
[17:29.090 --> 17:30.750]  We're playing a better video game.
[17:30.950 --> 17:36.110]  We're not annoying, we're just playing Call of Duty the way it was built to be played.
[17:36.510 --> 17:36.810]  Why?
[17:37.090 --> 17:37.950]  We didn't trick anything.
[17:38.790 --> 17:39.810]  These are mechanics that are built to be played.
[17:40.490 --> 17:41.790]  They had to play test this.
[17:41.870 --> 17:43.370]  They had to know people were gonna smoke out.
[17:43.530 --> 17:44.090]  Smoke out!
[17:44.750 --> 17:45.510]  How do you not?
[17:47.070 --> 17:47.770]  Smoke out!
[17:48.510 --> 17:49.230]  Smoke out!
[17:49.730 --> 17:51.030]  Oh, they're in the smoke out room!
[17:52.210 --> 17:53.650]  They've been all smoke out rooms!
[17:53.930 --> 17:55.910]  They're gonna be ready to get fuckin' smoked!
[17:57.230 --> 17:57.710]  Grenade!
[17:58.070 --> 17:58.510]  Smoke out!
[17:58.870 --> 17:59.310]  Smoke out!
[18:00.750 --> 18:02.710]  Fellas, I don't know where I am!
[18:03.110 --> 18:03.830]  Grenade out!
[18:04.270 --> 18:04.850]  Smoke out!
[18:06.270 --> 18:08.730]  Gavin, to your right, I just put down a...
[18:09.340 --> 18:10.210]  I just put a refill.
[18:10.550 --> 18:14.010]  Can you pop a thing on the map?
[18:14.670 --> 18:15.770]  Hit up on the D-pad next to it.
[18:16.010 --> 18:16.730]  There it is.
[18:19.090 --> 18:19.450]  Oh, sweet.
[18:19.630 --> 18:21.530]  I'm gonna do the same, and there it is.
[18:21.550 --> 18:21.950]  Hell yeah.
[18:23.210 --> 18:23.630]  Smoke out!
[18:23.930 --> 18:25.510]  I can't see a thing!
[18:26.450 --> 18:27.250]  Smoke out!
[18:27.710 --> 18:28.170]  Smoke out!
[18:28.210 --> 18:28.570]  Smoke out!
[18:29.970 --> 18:31.670]  I threw a smoke about his arsehole.
[18:31.730 --> 18:31.950]  Smoke out!
[18:32.970 --> 18:35.010]  I panicked and smoked in two places!
[18:35.290 --> 18:36.730]  It's glitching like shit sometimes.
[18:36.950 --> 18:38.410]  Oh my god, what was that about?
[18:38.410 --> 18:40.490]  The world's going insane!
[18:41.370 --> 18:42.550]  What is that?
[18:43.070 --> 18:44.490]  The lights are flickering!
[18:44.730 --> 18:45.350]  Yeah, they're flickering!
[18:45.990 --> 18:48.050]  I've never... Call of Duty doesn't know what to do!
[18:48.390 --> 18:48.990]  Smoke out!
[18:49.510 --> 18:49.990]  Smoke out!
[18:50.150 --> 18:50.490]  Smoke out!
[18:50.950 --> 18:52.310]  It can't handle all the smoke!
[18:52.490 --> 18:52.950]  There's too much smoke!
[18:54.490 --> 18:55.390]  Smoke out!
[18:55.550 --> 18:56.270]  Smoke out!
[18:57.070 --> 18:57.890]  Smoke out!
[18:58.250 --> 18:59.110]  Smoke out!
[18:59.270 --> 18:59.750]  Oh no!
[19:00.330 --> 19:02.070]  They're jumping over me!
[19:02.270 --> 19:03.690]  They're jumping over me!
[19:04.910 --> 19:05.530]  Smoke out!
[19:06.310 --> 19:06.910]  Grenade!
[19:07.230 --> 19:07.770]  Grenade!
[19:08.470 --> 19:09.250]  Smoke out!
[19:09.270 --> 19:10.210]  Smoke out!
[19:10.530 --> 19:12.230]  I'm just running into the wall!
[19:12.690 --> 19:13.750]  I'm running into a TV!
[19:14.290 --> 19:14.770]  Where am I?
[19:16.010 --> 19:17.030]  Alright, I'm coming back in.
[19:17.330 --> 19:17.910]  Smoke out!
[19:20.630 --> 19:21.350]  Smoke out!
[19:21.350 --> 19:21.670]  Smoke out!
[19:24.810 --> 19:25.370]  Grenade!
[19:25.510 --> 19:25.770]  Grenade!
[19:25.990 --> 19:26.030]  Grenade out!
[19:26.310 --> 19:26.870]  Smoke out!
[19:28.610 --> 19:29.170]  Grenade!
[19:31.170 --> 19:31.930]  Smoke out!
[19:34.470 --> 19:35.670]  Need some smoke!
[19:36.070 --> 19:36.550]  Smoke out!
[19:36.550 --> 19:38.010]  Don't worry, I got smoke!
[19:38.310 --> 19:38.550]  Smoke out!
[19:39.030 --> 19:39.510]  Smoke out!
[19:41.310 --> 19:41.950]  Smoke out!
[19:42.790 --> 19:43.210]  Smoke out!
[19:43.210 --> 19:44.290]  I'm back, smoke!
[19:44.590 --> 19:45.330]  I'm in the bathroom!
[19:46.130 --> 19:47.710]  I don't remember where my spot is!
[19:47.970 --> 19:48.630]  I can't see!
[19:48.710 --> 19:48.970]  Smoke!
[19:49.130 --> 19:49.550]  Smoke out!
[19:49.910 --> 19:50.190]  Smoke!
[19:50.530 --> 19:52.430]  I just got a refill here!
[19:52.990 --> 19:54.530]  Refill here, I just dropped it on the map!
[19:54.870 --> 19:55.190]  Grenade!
[19:55.510 --> 19:56.550]  About to drop a refill myself!
[19:56.970 --> 19:57.510]  It's right here!
[19:57.910 --> 19:59.150]  I got blown up right through the chair!
[20:04.200 --> 20:05.120]  Ah, fucking asshole!
[20:05.440 --> 20:05.820]  Smoke out!
[20:06.820 --> 20:07.340]  Smoke out!
[20:07.840 --> 20:08.480]  Smoke out!
[20:08.480 --> 20:10.220]  I'm not picking up any of these tags!
[20:10.660 --> 20:11.140]  I'm not either!
[20:11.560 --> 20:11.940]  I'm just annoying them!
[20:12.620 --> 20:14.940]  Ah, nice smoke there!
[20:15.420 --> 20:15.800]  Smoke out!
[20:17.040 --> 20:17.380]  Grenade!
[20:17.400 --> 20:18.180]  Someone behind you!
[20:18.700 --> 20:19.320]  I got you!
[20:19.400 --> 20:20.000]  I saved you!
[20:20.040 --> 20:20.580]  You saved me!
[20:20.660 --> 20:21.260]  You saved me!
[20:21.920 --> 20:22.960]  I killed Echo with a frag!
[20:23.440 --> 20:23.940]  Smoke out!
[20:25.440 --> 20:27.880]  I can just see men crawling through the smoke!
[20:30.880 --> 20:31.740]  Smoke out!
[20:31.860 --> 20:32.960]  Smoke out!
[20:33.660 --> 20:34.380]  Smoke out!
[20:35.220 --> 20:35.580]  Smoke out!
[20:35.580 --> 20:36.020]  Smoke out!
[20:36.020 --> 20:36.580]  Smoke out!
[20:38.400 --> 20:40.360]  I'm out of tactical, I'm throwing a bag down!
[20:40.980 --> 20:41.440]  Smoke out!
[20:42.300 --> 20:43.040]  Another smoke!
[20:43.400 --> 20:44.760]  I'm hiding in my bag, smoke out!
[20:45.760 --> 20:46.500]  I don't see anyone!
[20:46.620 --> 20:46.920]  Another smoke!
[20:48.300 --> 20:48.740]  Grenade!
[20:49.200 --> 20:49.620]  Smoke out!
[20:50.740 --> 20:51.280]  Smoke out!
[20:52.360 --> 20:53.000]  Grenade out!
[20:53.400 --> 20:54.620]  I got a smoke assist!
[20:54.840 --> 20:55.260]  He got me!
[20:55.520 --> 20:57.520]  A guy was stood on my head and I shot his knees!
[20:57.640 --> 20:58.600]  Ah, I can't see!
[20:59.300 --> 20:59.880]  Oh, god!
[21:00.760 --> 21:01.200]  We lost!
[21:01.500 --> 21:02.700]  How did we lose?
[21:02.780 --> 21:03.580]  We were so close!
[21:03.580 --> 21:06.940]  We only did one worse than we did the previous time.
[21:07.060 --> 21:09.760]  I feel like if it was just regular deathmatch we would have had that.
[21:10.320 --> 21:10.500]  Yeah.
[21:11.340 --> 21:12.960]  Well, yeah, I think so.
[21:14.140 --> 21:18.160]  I wonder how Chuck Norris felt being on our team.
[21:21.520 --> 21:22.660]  Oh, look at this!
[21:22.780 --> 21:25.160]  This is like the only way to play this.
[21:25.340 --> 21:26.480]  This is so awesome.
[21:30.560 --> 21:33.000]  Did someone get their rosary beads punched off?
[21:33.380 --> 21:34.540]  Oh, my god!
[21:37.660 --> 21:39.080]  Somebody got dereligion.
[21:40.380 --> 21:41.960]  Can we do one more?
[21:41.960 --> 21:42.500]  We gotta do one more.
[21:42.780 --> 21:43.440]  Yeah, we gotta do one more.
[21:45.600 --> 21:46.620]  Oh, that's so fun.
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.440]  This is one of the dumber things we've done in a while.
[21:48.480 --> 21:49.140]  Oh, I love it!
[21:49.300 --> 21:49.800]  This is a blast.
[21:50.240 --> 21:51.000]  This is so good.
[21:51.320 --> 21:52.260]  Let's do it again, dude.
[21:52.280 --> 21:56.320]  This is one of those things when it's 2.30 in the morning and you know you need to go to sleep,
[21:56.440 --> 21:59.740]  but you really just want to keep playing video games and you get the giggles.
[21:59.740 --> 22:04.200]  It just becomes the funniest thing on earth for about five minutes where you can't breathe.
[22:04.360 --> 22:07.800]  Yeah, my face hurts just from smiling for the last six minutes straight.
[22:08.140 --> 22:08.900]  Oh, man.
[22:09.780 --> 22:11.240]  I want to do this with Falcons.
[22:12.420 --> 22:13.360]  Oh, yeah!
[22:13.520 --> 22:14.220]  Big team smoke out?
[22:14.900 --> 22:16.000]  Yeah, smoke out!
[22:16.140 --> 22:16.980]  Falcon team smoke out!
[22:17.080 --> 22:18.460]  Yeah, Falcon smoke out, dude.
[22:18.600 --> 22:18.960]  Yeah.
[22:19.480 --> 22:20.520]  That's a great idea.
[22:20.860 --> 22:22.440]  Yeah, I think that would be a lot of fun.
[22:22.540 --> 22:23.340]  Alright, here we go.
[22:23.680 --> 22:23.960]  Face us.
[22:25.780 --> 22:29.280]  Oh, we're playing with Xbox?
[22:29.620 --> 22:30.140]  That rules.
[22:30.260 --> 22:31.060]  Oh my god.
[22:31.460 --> 22:32.020]  All Xbox.
[22:32.720 --> 22:32.980]  Wow.
[22:33.100 --> 22:33.660]  Hell yeah.
[22:33.840 --> 22:34.660]  They made this thing.
[22:34.760 --> 22:35.660]  That's so cool.
[22:35.800 --> 22:36.280]  He's on our team.
[22:36.940 --> 22:39.540]  Dude, how do you get a username like Xbox?
[22:41.280 --> 22:43.720]  Well, I think for the Activision thing, you can just have whatever you want.
[22:44.200 --> 22:44.380]  Yeah.
[22:44.720 --> 22:45.860]  What's your username, Microsoft?
[22:46.200 --> 22:46.720]  Oh, he's gone.
[22:47.120 --> 22:47.700]  He's on the other team.
[22:48.100 --> 22:50.400]  Oh, we're against Xbox?
[22:50.860 --> 22:51.440]  Oh, no.
[22:52.140 --> 22:53.040]  He's got an advantage.
[22:53.200 --> 22:53.640]  He's Xbox.
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.780]  They have no idea what's about to happen.
[22:56.840 --> 22:57.120]  Nope.
[22:59.700 --> 23:02.520]  To be honest, I don't think I know what's about to happen either.
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.820]  This is like the funniest, this is the only way I want to play this game.
[23:06.980 --> 23:08.320]  This is so much fun.
[23:08.600 --> 23:08.640]  I agree.
[23:08.640 --> 23:09.920]  I'm having a blast.
[23:10.780 --> 23:12.660]  Alright, I'm going to go as far as possible and throw the smoke.
[23:13.380 --> 23:13.560]  Here we go.
[23:13.620 --> 23:13.960]  Smoke out.
[23:14.380 --> 23:14.720]  Smoke out.
[23:15.060 --> 23:16.120]  Smoke out.
[23:16.500 --> 23:17.100]  Smoke out.
[23:17.340 --> 23:17.980]  Smoke it out.
[23:18.100 --> 23:19.560]  It's like six grenades flying at me.
[23:19.560 --> 23:20.140]  Smoke out.
[23:20.320 --> 23:21.600]  Oh my god.
[23:23.000 --> 23:23.540]  Smoke out.
[23:24.020 --> 23:24.700]  Smoke out.
[23:27.440 --> 23:28.240]  Smoke out.
[23:28.380 --> 23:29.560]  Oh, I'm beating him up in the doorway.
[23:29.740 --> 23:30.220]  Hey, got me.
[23:31.240 --> 23:33.240]  Oh, I got fucking stabbed.
[23:33.240 --> 23:33.860]  Oh, shit.
[23:34.120 --> 23:35.140]  He just stormed in with a power drill.
[23:35.380 --> 23:35.760]  Smoke out.
[23:35.980 --> 23:36.500]  Smoke out.
[23:36.700 --> 23:37.180]  Smoke out.
[23:38.020 --> 23:38.820]  Smoke out.
[23:39.040 --> 23:39.180]  Smoke out.
[23:39.180 --> 23:39.420]  Smoke out.
[23:40.780 --> 23:41.300]  Smoke out.
[23:42.440 --> 23:43.540]  Get some smoke going.
[23:43.620 --> 23:44.580]  Oh, I got slit with a drill.
[23:45.940 --> 23:46.460]  Smoke out.
[23:46.800 --> 23:46.820]  Line fired.
[23:46.820 --> 23:47.880]  I got storm aired again.
[23:48.840 --> 23:49.780]  Oh, that guy's working on something.
[23:50.000 --> 23:50.240]  Holy shit.
[23:50.360 --> 23:50.600]  Good for him.
[23:50.700 --> 23:51.280]  Smoke out.
[23:51.360 --> 23:51.580]  Smoke out.
[23:52.540 --> 23:53.780]  Let's go ahead and grenade out.
[23:53.820 --> 23:54.300]  Smoke out.
[23:54.380 --> 23:54.840]  Run back the other way.
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.700]  These guys are having none of our shit.
[23:56.840 --> 23:58.800]  They don't like it.
[23:59.080 --> 24:00.440]  Ah, I got a drill in the throat.
[24:01.100 --> 24:03.460]  Every once in a while you play against people that know what they're doing.
[24:03.680 --> 24:04.080]  Smoke out.
[24:04.440 --> 24:05.100]  Smoke out.
[24:05.880 --> 24:06.600]  Smoke out.
[24:07.460 --> 24:07.860]  Grenade.
[24:08.400 --> 24:08.660]  Smoke.
[24:08.740 --> 24:09.260]  Smoke out.
[24:09.660 --> 24:10.260]  Smoke out.
[24:10.440 --> 24:10.740]  Smoke out.
[24:11.440 --> 24:13.320]  Oh, I got stuck, dude.
[24:13.400 --> 24:15.940]  This guy is racking up those fucking melee kills with me.
[24:17.320 --> 24:17.800]  Smoke out.
[24:18.220 --> 24:18.740]  Smoke out.
[24:19.140 --> 24:20.520]  Oh, I just got knifed in the back.
[24:20.520 --> 24:21.920]  In that little hallway.
[24:22.140 --> 24:22.940]  I see.
[24:23.320 --> 24:24.300]  Dead storm air.
[24:25.200 --> 24:26.740]  Oh, he's just riding around with his drill.
[24:26.920 --> 24:27.480]  Oh, no.
[24:27.600 --> 24:28.300]  I got drilled.
[24:28.700 --> 24:29.680]  He's so fast.
[24:30.500 --> 24:31.280]  He is very fast.
[24:31.420 --> 24:31.540]  Smoke out.
[24:31.960 --> 24:32.300]  Smoke out.
[24:32.300 --> 24:34.180]  He's pretty fast without a gun.
[24:34.300 --> 24:34.980]  Smoke out.
[24:40.380 --> 24:42.660]  These guys are not having our shit, dude.
[24:43.080 --> 24:44.480]  They don't care about this.
[24:44.800 --> 24:45.160]  It's getting dark in the kitchen, dude.
[24:45.280 --> 24:45.820]  Smoke out.
[24:45.840 --> 24:47.300]  There's like waves of fucking dirt.
[24:47.400 --> 24:48.340]  I'm slitting shins.
[24:48.500 --> 24:49.040]  I got myself.
[24:49.400 --> 24:49.780]  Smoke out.
[24:52.100 --> 24:53.120]  Peter Storm here.
[24:53.220 --> 24:53.580]  No!
[24:53.780 --> 24:54.680]  I love your work.
[24:56.800 --> 24:58.180]  Oh, shotgun me.
[24:58.440 --> 24:58.860]  Smoke out.
[25:00.680 --> 25:03.200]  I like the unpimped auto commercials.
[25:03.460 --> 25:03.980]  Oh!
[25:04.760 --> 25:05.240]  Smoke out.
[25:05.380 --> 25:05.860]  Smoke out.
[25:06.620 --> 25:07.020]  Headshot.
[25:09.180 --> 25:10.400]  Oh, they're dropping down.
[25:10.400 --> 25:10.760]  Drop the refill.
[25:11.400 --> 25:11.620]  Smoke out.
[25:11.620 --> 25:13.900]  If you see the little trophy systems, pop them.
[25:14.440 --> 25:15.160]  They'll stop the smoke.
[25:16.640 --> 25:17.240]  Alright, smoke out.
[25:17.760 --> 25:18.260]  Smoke out.
[25:18.740 --> 25:19.220]  Where am I?
[25:20.020 --> 25:20.640]  Smoke out.
[25:20.980 --> 25:21.340]  Grenade.
[25:21.980 --> 25:22.340]  Grenade.
[25:23.440 --> 25:23.980]  Smoke out.
[25:24.460 --> 25:26.180]  I don't know if I've killed a single person in this.
[25:26.400 --> 25:26.740]  Don't worry about it.
[25:26.760 --> 25:28.620]  I think he's going to get a nuke with just a drill.
[25:29.780 --> 25:30.140]  Ah!
[25:30.460 --> 25:30.820]  Fuck!
[25:31.620 --> 25:32.680]  Oh, God.
[25:33.120 --> 25:33.980]  I got drilled again.
[25:34.060 --> 25:34.760]  I fell out of the map.
[25:34.980 --> 25:35.560]  Smoke out.
[25:35.680 --> 25:36.180]  Smoke out.
[25:36.320 --> 25:37.120]  Oh, flashbang.
[25:38.440 --> 25:42.420]  I had a nuke come up in a regular team deathmatch multiplayer game the other day.
[25:42.440 --> 25:43.120]  No, Peter Storm here.
[25:43.440 --> 25:43.820]  Oh, wow.
[25:44.440 --> 25:45.600]  It was just like, hey, game's over now.
[25:45.640 --> 25:46.380]  Who's this in the bog?
[25:47.460 --> 25:48.200]  I'm in the bog.
[25:48.200 --> 25:49.280]  Smoke out.
[25:50.020 --> 25:51.380]  I'm in the...
[25:51.420 --> 25:52.800]  Oh, I punched him in the legs.
[25:53.400 --> 25:54.320]  I got the smoke assist.
[25:56.000 --> 25:56.640]  Smoke out.
[25:56.900 --> 25:57.360]  Smoke out.
[25:57.360 --> 25:57.440]  Smoke out.
[25:57.440 --> 25:57.820]  Get away from me.
[25:57.820 --> 25:58.180]  Smoke out.
[25:58.300 --> 25:58.740]  Smoke out.
[26:00.140 --> 26:00.500]  Jesus.
[26:00.980 --> 26:01.700]  Holy shit.
[26:01.960 --> 26:02.320]  Holy shit.
[26:02.480 --> 26:03.780]  That was one of you, I think.
[26:04.480 --> 26:04.940]  Smoke out.
[26:05.060 --> 26:05.680]  Mistakes were made.
[26:05.980 --> 26:06.180]  Grenade.
[26:06.420 --> 26:06.740]  Smoke out.
[26:06.820 --> 26:07.620]  Andrew killed himself.
[26:08.260 --> 26:11.940]  I thought it was one of them, but it was one of you, so I just blew myself up for no reason.
[26:12.020 --> 26:12.380]  Grenade.
[26:14.140 --> 26:15.340]  Alright, just de-Storm here.
[26:15.360 --> 26:15.920]  Fuck Storm here.
[26:16.200 --> 26:17.040]  Yeah, nice job.
[26:17.080 --> 26:17.760]  You saved my life.
[26:17.760 --> 26:19.620]  I was about to bash my brain in with a bat.
[26:20.140 --> 26:20.560]  Smoke out.
[26:21.040 --> 26:21.660]  Smoke out.
[26:22.600 --> 26:23.600]  Oh, that guy has one.
[26:24.620 --> 26:25.280]  A thermal scope.
[26:25.800 --> 26:26.060]  Smoke out.
[26:26.220 --> 26:30.580]  We've been so deep in this smoke, I just realized you can jump from one side to the other.
[26:30.800 --> 26:31.920]  Oh, I didn't know you could do that.
[26:32.380 --> 26:33.160]  Didn't know none of that.
[26:34.280 --> 26:34.660]  Molotov.
[26:35.240 --> 26:35.740]  Smoke out.
[26:35.900 --> 26:37.040]  Oh, you mean in the... yeah.
[26:38.760 --> 26:39.620]  Wait, where's the reload?
[26:40.120 --> 26:40.540]  Got him.
[26:40.700 --> 26:42.400]  I don't know why I'm shooting.
[26:42.840 --> 26:43.320]  Smoke out.
[26:43.740 --> 26:46.000]  Oh, it's getting real fucking dicey in the hallway here.
[26:46.740 --> 26:47.400]  Oh, I got someone.
[26:48.060 --> 26:49.500]  Disco lights are starting to turn on.
[26:49.560 --> 26:50.280]  Smoke out, smoke out.
[26:51.320 --> 26:52.840]  I can see too much of this room.
[26:52.920 --> 26:53.380]  Smoke out.
[26:53.800 --> 26:54.440]  Yeah, too much.
[26:54.540 --> 26:54.840]  Smoke out.
[26:55.320 --> 26:55.880]  Smoke out.
[26:56.300 --> 26:56.940]  Got too much room.
[26:57.220 --> 26:57.960]  Die, you bastard.
[26:58.320 --> 26:58.780]  Smoke out.
[26:59.660 --> 26:59.960]  No!
[27:01.240 --> 27:01.680]  No!
[27:02.740 --> 27:03.400]  Smoke out.
[27:03.760 --> 27:04.120]  Smoke out.
[27:04.900 --> 27:05.340]  Grenade.
[27:05.920 --> 27:06.360]  Grenade.
[27:06.400 --> 27:06.840]  Grenade.
[27:07.280 --> 27:07.720]  Molotov.
[27:08.660 --> 27:09.100]  Fuck it.
[27:09.200 --> 27:09.560]  Smoke out.
[27:09.720 --> 27:11.180]  Fuck it.
[27:11.400 --> 27:11.980]  Smoke out.
[27:12.460 --> 27:13.640]  It's like I'm in a storm.
[27:14.440 --> 27:15.320]  Charged with death.
[27:16.660 --> 27:17.520]  Smoke out.
[27:18.360 --> 27:18.980]  Smoke out.
[27:18.980 --> 27:19.420]  Back down.
[27:19.420 --> 27:20.480]  We got trophy systems up.
[27:20.620 --> 27:21.300]  Smoke out.
[27:21.860 --> 27:23.100]  Kill the trophy system.
[27:23.320 --> 27:24.320]  Kill the trophy system.
[27:24.700 --> 27:25.200]  No mercy.
[27:25.820 --> 27:27.440]  Where did I get this gun from?
[27:28.400 --> 27:30.040]  It's like demons in the smoke.
[27:30.680 --> 27:31.100]  Grenade.
[27:31.400 --> 27:31.940]  Smoke out.
[27:33.500 --> 27:34.360]  Smoke out.
[27:35.520 --> 27:36.020]  Oh, the bomb.
[27:36.020 --> 27:36.720]  Oh, the bomb.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.300]  Smoke out.
[27:38.640 --> 27:39.380]  Smoke out.
[27:39.560 --> 27:40.200]  Smoke out.
[27:40.500 --> 27:40.960]  Smoke out.
[27:41.160 --> 27:41.740]  Smoke out.
[27:42.260 --> 27:43.180]  Smoke bomb death.
[27:43.180 --> 27:43.600]  Smoke out.
[27:45.280 --> 27:46.980]  Oh, another smoke.
[27:47.120 --> 27:47.580]  Smoke out.
[27:50.000 --> 27:50.560]  Grenade.
[27:51.980 --> 27:56.380]  This video is going to be 40 minutes of five people saying smoke out over and over again and laughing.
[27:57.060 --> 28:01.840]  The audience is either going to love it or absolutely hate it.
[28:01.960 --> 28:03.540]  Smoke out.
[28:05.840 --> 28:06.400]  Grenade.
[28:07.340 --> 28:08.120]  Smoke out.
[28:08.260 --> 28:08.920]  Storm air.
[28:10.820 --> 28:11.660]  Smoke out.
[28:12.360 --> 28:13.320]  Peter, no!
[28:13.720 --> 28:14.240]  Smoke out.
[28:14.600 --> 28:16.560]  We got to make sure there's subtitles on this video.
[28:16.760 --> 28:16.980]  Smoke out.
[28:17.180 --> 28:17.760]  Smoke out.
[28:18.340 --> 28:18.740]  Smoke out.
[28:19.100 --> 28:19.880]  Peter, no!
[28:20.020 --> 28:20.520]  Smoke assist.
[28:23.980 --> 28:24.460]  Baseball.
[28:24.500 --> 28:24.660]  Smoke out.
[28:28.200 --> 28:29.080]  Smoke out.
[28:29.420 --> 28:29.780]  Get away.
[28:30.420 --> 28:30.640]  Grenade.
[28:30.640 --> 28:31.040]  Smoke out.
[28:31.720 --> 28:32.420]  Smoke out.
[28:33.560 --> 28:34.740]  We're all in the same room.
[28:34.760 --> 28:35.860]  We're all getting executed.
[28:36.260 --> 28:36.940]  Oh, God.
[28:37.180 --> 28:37.660]  It's...
[28:37.660 --> 28:38.360]  Smoke out.
[28:41.880 --> 28:42.640]  Grenade out.
[28:43.820 --> 28:44.620]  Smoke it out.
[28:44.980 --> 28:46.800]  I found a gun with a thermal scope.
[28:46.920 --> 28:47.440]  Smoke out.
[28:47.620 --> 28:48.080]  Hell yeah.
[28:48.320 --> 28:48.860]  Smoke out.
[28:49.080 --> 28:50.160]  Smoke out.
[28:50.360 --> 28:50.760]  Smoke out.
[28:50.940 --> 28:51.920]  It's probably one of the ones Gavin dropped.
[28:52.160 --> 28:53.980]  I'm getting kills through someone's butt.
[28:54.220 --> 28:54.880]  Eric's butt.
[28:57.100 --> 29:02.920]  My hope is that I'm playing Call of Duty one night by myself leveling up, grinding, and I get into a match where this is happening.
[29:03.460 --> 29:04.840]  And it's like...
[29:04.840 --> 29:06.420]  We unintentionally...
[29:06.420 --> 29:09.320]  Very intentionally create something that exists outside of us.
[29:09.400 --> 29:09.720]  Smoke out.
[29:10.200 --> 29:10.720]  Smoke out!
[29:11.200 --> 29:12.060]  Oh, I got him!
[29:13.060 --> 29:13.940]  Oh, shit. Nice.
[29:14.140 --> 29:14.360]  Oh!
[29:14.640 --> 29:14.940]  Yeah!
[29:15.740 --> 29:16.780]  That one was close, though.
[29:16.840 --> 29:17.940]  That one was really close.
[29:18.060 --> 29:18.280]  That was great.
[29:18.280 --> 29:19.800]  We only lost by about 100.
[29:20.120 --> 29:20.580]  That's crazy.
[29:20.600 --> 29:21.380]  That was really close.
[29:21.420 --> 29:22.140]  Under 100.
[29:22.500 --> 29:22.820]  97.
[29:24.460 --> 29:25.360]  Way to go, guys.
[29:25.660 --> 29:26.380]  Dude, I'm...
[29:26.380 --> 29:26.640]  Oh, wow.
[29:27.060 --> 29:27.840]  Big surprise.
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.200]  Best play was Xbox.
[29:29.600 --> 29:30.660]  Yeah, no kidding.
[29:31.580 --> 29:32.460]  Fucking hacks.
[29:32.640 --> 29:33.180]  He cheated.
[29:33.800 --> 29:34.460]  Xbox cheated.
[29:35.560 --> 29:36.400]  Don't mind me.
[29:36.480 --> 29:38.260]  I'm just the thing you're playing on.
[29:38.600 --> 29:40.760]  I guess I'm pretty good.
[29:43.100 --> 29:43.620]  Oh!
[29:47.800 --> 29:49.200]  There he is.
[29:49.820 --> 29:50.800]  There he is.
[29:50.860 --> 29:51.640]  The man himself.
