[00:00.000 --> 00:02.080]  Did everyone else have to turn Eric down a fuck ton?
[00:02.640 --> 00:02.800]  No.
[00:02.880 --> 00:04.040]  Am I- am I really loud?
[00:04.460 --> 00:04.720]  You were-
[00:04.720 --> 00:07.020]  Yeah, I think- I think- I think that's just your personal preference.
[00:10.640 --> 00:15.900]  I think that's just- I think that's just the amount of time we spend together.
[00:17.360 --> 00:19.260]  Anyone else have to turn this fucking idiot down?
[00:19.800 --> 00:23.520]  Does anyone else find Eric's voice to be just incredibly fucking grating all day long?
[00:23.720 --> 00:24.740]  Across three different companies?
[00:25.020 --> 00:27.200]  Anyone else in this lobby feel like they've spent too much time with Eric this week?
[00:30.000 --> 00:30.960]  I hear you.
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.120]  First, I agree.
[01:09.340 --> 01:11.680]  Okay, so this is the beginning of the video.
[01:16.780 --> 01:19.740]  Uh, what's up guys? We're playing Repo.
[01:19.980 --> 01:23.060]  Gavin, he didn't want to hear what he had to say. He was typing for so long.
[01:23.400 --> 01:25.520]  He was typing for so long.
[01:25.960 --> 01:28.200]  He was typing for so long.
[01:30.560 --> 01:31.040]  Uh...
[01:31.040 --> 01:31.120]  Uh...
[01:31.120 --> 01:32.020]  Oh my god.
[01:32.700 --> 01:34.580]  Oh, it's in stereo now.
[01:34.880 --> 01:36.320]  Oh god, it's everywhere.
[01:36.700 --> 01:39.360]  Uh, guys, welcome to Repo.
[01:39.460 --> 01:41.100]  This is a four player game.
[01:42.100 --> 01:43.380]  Rock music in the background.
[01:43.740 --> 01:44.420]  What? Rock-
[01:44.420 --> 01:44.580]  What?
[01:44.780 --> 01:45.500]  Do you hear music?
[01:46.280 --> 01:47.440]  You guys don't hear music?
[01:47.980 --> 01:48.140]  No.
[01:48.320 --> 01:48.540]  No.
[01:49.700 --> 01:50.980]  What the fuck?
[01:51.400 --> 01:52.000]  Do you hear music?
[01:52.560 --> 01:53.200]  Uh oh.
[01:53.760 --> 01:55.640]  Hey, hey Geoff, does this look cool?
[01:56.420 --> 01:58.660]  Hold on, I gotta get out of here and figure out where I'm hearing music from.
[02:01.780 --> 02:04.940]  If you press Q, you can dive into a little ball.
[02:05.300 --> 02:08.500]  Oh my god, you were talking about how the background music was a noise.
[02:09.500 --> 02:12.960]  This whole time, I've had background music going. I just think that's what it was.
[02:13.060 --> 02:14.220]  It was MLB The Show.
[02:14.960 --> 02:15.740]  You're an idiot.
[02:16.400 --> 02:17.540]  You played this, right?
[02:19.720 --> 02:22.880]  Uh, well obviously WASDA to move.
[02:23.100 --> 02:26.060]  I think run. Okay, crouch is control.
[02:26.280 --> 02:27.040]  Shift should be run.
[02:28.920 --> 02:30.840]  T is for text.
[02:33.200 --> 02:35.680]  And Q, you roll into a little ball and you can hide.
[02:36.540 --> 02:42.380]  Okay, what are we hiding for? I've only seen stupid social clips of this game. I can't wait to see what the game's about.
[02:42.980 --> 02:46.440]  I played the tutorial and it said use crouch to hide from monsters.
[02:47.100 --> 02:48.600]  Yeah, and crouch is what? Control?
[02:50.220 --> 02:50.620]  Yes.
[02:51.360 --> 02:53.420]  If you control on a hill, do I roll away?
[02:55.480 --> 02:58.740]  If you jump out of a plane and you hit control, can you roll down a mountain?
[03:00.720 --> 03:02.460]  Q is the ball, but it also rolls.
[03:03.120 --> 03:05.940]  Check this out. So you roll into the corner here.
[03:05.940 --> 03:06.360]  Oh, cool.
[03:06.980 --> 03:07.820]  Under this table.
[03:07.940 --> 03:14.360]  So it seems like the point of this game is to find treasure, steal the treasure, put the treasure in the cart, and then put the cart on the thing?
[03:15.380 --> 03:15.700]  Yes.
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.280]  And we're trying to get a very specific amount of $12,096.
[03:22.020 --> 03:28.840]  You can break things very easily, so you pick it up and put it into the cart, and the cart usually keeps it safer.
[03:29.020 --> 03:30.760]  Unless you're rocking it around.
[03:31.020 --> 03:32.580]  So we take the cart with us.
[03:32.760 --> 03:33.740]  Oh, the cart floats.
[03:34.640 --> 03:38.020]  Do we just push it, or could you like, walk onto it?
[03:38.280 --> 03:40.500]  Hold the left mouse button.
[03:41.140 --> 03:41.580]  Oh.
[03:41.800 --> 03:42.480]  And you can push it.
[03:42.740 --> 03:43.480]  Daddy's on his way.
[03:43.940 --> 03:45.360]  Oh, I can't hit Eric much anymore.
[03:45.620 --> 03:45.920]  Eric!
[03:46.740 --> 03:47.440]  What's up, dude?
[03:47.620 --> 03:48.660]  It's proximity based.
[03:49.300 --> 03:50.980]  Yeah, I know. And I'm ready to go.
[03:51.520 --> 03:53.180]  Hey, there might be spiders in here.
[03:53.240 --> 03:56.200]  So if I shut the door, if I shut the door behind Eric...
[03:56.200 --> 03:59.100]  Yeah, don't worry, I'll get the cart all by myself. You guys just have fun up there.
[04:00.280 --> 04:01.460]  Oh, you hit me with the cart!
[04:01.460 --> 04:02.900]  Oh, I missed it and ran over.
[04:03.000 --> 04:03.440]  I ran over.
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.540]  You hit me with the cart.
[04:06.460 --> 04:09.440]  I hit the cart, it's very fucking important, and everybody's like, alright, it's D and Geoff.
[04:10.120 --> 04:10.780]  Geoff, you've got to stop.
[04:11.160 --> 04:12.600]  I'll get it, Geoff, I'll get it. Okay, you got it.
[04:12.620 --> 04:13.240]  I got it.
[04:13.700 --> 04:19.660]  Yeah, and the thing that I know about this game, you can grab with the left click, and then you spin stuff with the right click.
[04:19.660 --> 04:21.400]  That seems important somehow.
[04:21.820 --> 04:22.020]  Oh.
[04:25.240 --> 04:25.780]  Take a look.
[04:26.720 --> 04:27.740]  I'm going to go over here.
[04:27.860 --> 04:29.100]  I'm going to go as far away from you guys as I can.
[04:29.120 --> 04:30.720]  You're going to run out of stamina.
[04:31.160 --> 04:32.340]  I did, I ran out of stamina.
[04:33.480 --> 04:35.060]  Oh, hey guys, I found a valuable.
[04:36.260 --> 04:37.220]  Is it a vase?
[04:37.380 --> 04:38.040]  It is a vase.
[04:39.180 --> 04:40.260]  Here, we can lift it together.
[04:40.420 --> 04:40.720]  Okay.
[04:41.020 --> 04:42.920]  That doesn't seem like a good idea.
[04:44.040 --> 04:44.360]  Gavin.
[04:44.800 --> 04:45.280]  That's Geoff.
[04:45.540 --> 04:46.240]  Can all four of us lift it?
[04:46.240 --> 04:46.980]  Here we go, here we go.
[04:47.040 --> 04:50.520]  You can try, but we can also hurt it by crashing into each other, by the way.
[04:50.540 --> 04:52.180]  Ah, there's a monster shooting at us.
[04:52.660 --> 04:53.740]  What the fuck?
[04:54.660 --> 04:56.300]  Somebody just fired a gun at us.
[04:57.400 --> 04:58.620]  The vase is falling.
[04:59.880 --> 05:00.980]  Fuck the vase, dude.
[05:01.040 --> 05:03.560]  My blood's going to be falling out of my body if that bullet hits me.
[05:03.800 --> 05:05.340]  Don't worry, I saved the vase.
[05:06.500 --> 05:07.720]  I'm hiding, can he see me?
[05:10.280 --> 05:10.640]  Guys?
[05:17.890 --> 05:18.470]  Hang on.
[05:19.050 --> 05:19.390]  They're dead.
[05:19.390 --> 05:20.270]  Oh, he found me.
[05:20.310 --> 05:20.950]  Eric, they're dead.
[05:21.070 --> 05:21.570]  They're both dead.
[05:22.350 --> 05:22.970]  Are they really?
[05:23.190 --> 05:23.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:23.610 --> 05:24.830]  We can revive them, though.
[05:25.830 --> 05:26.690]  Okay, hang on.
[05:26.970 --> 05:29.070]  I have something to put in the cart.
[05:30.110 --> 05:31.330]  How do I distract the head?
[05:31.890 --> 05:33.570]  You take it back to the main base.
[05:34.490 --> 05:34.970]  Oh, okay.
[05:37.610 --> 05:38.730]  Broke the vase.
[05:41.930 --> 05:43.330]  What the fuck?
[05:43.630 --> 05:44.150]  I got a head.
[05:45.050 --> 05:45.910]  And that's Gavin.
[05:46.430 --> 05:49.710]  Mistakes happened with the vase, but I gotta take Gavin's head back somewhere.
[05:50.670 --> 05:51.610]  It's this way, Geoff.
[05:51.670 --> 05:51.990]  This way.
[05:52.550 --> 05:53.130]  Geoff, this way.
[05:53.630 --> 05:54.030]  Follow me.
[05:55.150 --> 05:56.730]  This motherfucker's got a gun again.
[05:57.190 --> 05:57.550]  Yeah.
[05:59.110 --> 06:00.890]  If I get shot, Geoff, revive me.
[06:02.250 --> 06:02.930]  Alright, up here.
[06:03.250 --> 06:04.250]  Bring him up here.
[06:04.530 --> 06:05.210]  Bring him on the ship.
[06:06.170 --> 06:06.530]  Oh, okay.
[06:09.850 --> 06:10.710]  Did you hear that?
[06:11.350 --> 06:13.350]  I think it was Eric screaming and dying.
[06:14.070 --> 06:15.730]  He should revive once you bring him up here.
[06:16.270 --> 06:16.670]  Huh.
[06:19.880 --> 06:20.680]  Are you sure?
[06:21.280 --> 06:23.280]  Maybe we have to get the money first.
[06:24.640 --> 06:27.120]  What goes over here on this thing with the sad face?
[06:27.240 --> 06:28.160]  That's where you put the money.
[06:28.660 --> 06:30.360]  Or put all the stuff to get the money.
[06:31.800 --> 06:33.320]  Maybe I have to right click him?
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.900]  I feel like we can bring Gavin back, but how?
[06:36.380 --> 06:37.780]  This might be it for ol' Eric.
[06:40.160 --> 06:40.560]  Whoa.
[06:44.250 --> 06:44.650]  No!
[06:44.650 --> 06:45.230]  No!
[06:49.090 --> 06:49.810]  Oh, boy.
[06:50.330 --> 06:51.510]  Gavin, I got blown away.
[06:52.410 --> 06:54.530]  Gavin, I got blown away.
[06:54.950 --> 06:55.850]  I'll figure it out, Gavin.
[06:55.930 --> 06:56.570]  Don't you worry.
[06:56.710 --> 06:58.310]  I heard a bunch of screaming in the distance.
[06:58.710 --> 07:02.230]  And then Geoff took my head back and couldn't figure out how to revive me.
[07:02.370 --> 07:03.510]  So I'm just sat in a bucket.
[07:04.490 --> 07:06.950]  We have 500 bucks in it, so I think we're a little short.
[07:07.910 --> 07:08.650]  How much do we need?
[07:08.730 --> 07:09.250]  10,000?
[07:09.430 --> 07:09.970]  12,000.
[07:11.150 --> 07:11.830]  Fuck me.
[07:12.770 --> 07:13.830]  Yeah, let's take a look around.
[07:14.650 --> 07:16.170]  And who's that dude that shoots at us?
[07:16.930 --> 07:18.770]  He's like the caretaker or something, I think.
[07:19.310 --> 07:20.610]  So are we thieves, then?
[07:21.570 --> 07:22.990]  I think we're repo guys.
[07:24.050 --> 07:25.710]  Oh, that's probably because of the name.
[07:27.050 --> 07:28.150]  These guys are fucked.
[07:28.150 --> 07:28.470]  We're fucked.
[07:28.710 --> 07:29.590]  Gavin, we're fucked.
[07:29.910 --> 07:30.050]  That makes total sense.
[07:30.250 --> 07:31.230]  There's no way.
[07:31.230 --> 07:32.170]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[07:32.210 --> 07:33.750]  I didn't make that connection earlier.
[07:33.930 --> 07:35.470]  Well, it took me a while the first time I played, too.
[07:36.190 --> 07:36.610]  Let's see.
[07:37.810 --> 07:38.650]  Oh, here's something.
[07:39.150 --> 07:40.010]  Do you think Eric lived?
[07:40.490 --> 07:40.850]  No.
[07:41.350 --> 07:42.470]  Oh, they're wondering if he lived.
[07:42.470 --> 07:44.570]  I like the dead peanut gallery.
[07:45.110 --> 07:48.070]  Geoff, if you use the mouse wheel, you can bring something closer to you.
[07:48.210 --> 07:50.210]  Geoff refuses to lift.
[07:50.330 --> 07:51.750]  He is just pulling straight back.
[07:52.170 --> 07:52.710]  There you go.
[07:59.240 --> 07:59.720]  Oops.
[08:03.100 --> 08:04.160]  I'm not delicate.
[08:07.160 --> 08:08.780]  I'm a fucking bruiser, dude.
[08:09.200 --> 08:12.000]  I apologize to everything that I touch.
[08:13.720 --> 08:14.660]  Geoff, I hear something.
[08:14.660 --> 08:15.440]  Alright, let's go.
[08:16.900 --> 08:18.000]  They're going the wrong way.
[08:18.040 --> 08:19.020]  So, like...
[08:19.020 --> 08:20.400]  What was that?
[08:21.080 --> 08:21.900]  I'm talking to you.
[08:22.380 --> 08:23.560]  Oh, that's right.
[08:23.860 --> 08:27.040]  I thought I fucking jacked from behind or something.
[08:27.520 --> 08:28.620]  I mean, you kind of did.
[08:29.160 --> 08:31.820]  Ooh, Geoff, this mug or this cup is worth $1,900.
[08:32.900 --> 08:33.960]  Holy shit, dude.
[08:34.060 --> 08:35.100]  Don't let me touch it.
[08:35.520 --> 08:36.140]  You got it.
[08:38.460 --> 08:40.960]  Oh, this diamond is worth $2,500.
[08:41.340 --> 08:44.220]  Well, it was worth a little bit more when you picked it up.
[08:45.280 --> 08:45.680]  Okay.
[08:45.900 --> 08:47.100]  How much do we have now?
[08:47.860 --> 08:48.260]  Tons.
[08:48.620 --> 08:49.880]  $6,000. We're halfway there.
[08:52.740 --> 08:58.100]  So then, we do all the work while Nick and Gavin are just jacking each other off back at the base.
[08:58.160 --> 08:59.020]  I mean, sorry, you're Nick.
[08:59.180 --> 09:01.360]  Eric and Gavin are just jacking each other off at the base.
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.680]  Well, Geoff's been so bad with names recently.
[09:06.020 --> 09:07.460]  I just don't get it.
[09:07.520 --> 09:08.360]  Is he like...
[09:08.360 --> 09:08.960]  Maybe he...
[09:08.960 --> 09:11.700]  Did he get cats that are breathing too much in him or what?
[09:11.800 --> 09:12.360]  It's fucked up.
[09:13.260 --> 09:14.640]  Oh, he's got a clunky monkey.
[09:14.640 --> 09:15.240]  Yeah.
[09:15.660 --> 09:16.920]  Oh, he's making monkey noise.
[09:16.920 --> 09:17.560]  Oh, he's making noise.
[09:19.500 --> 09:20.640]  Yeah, let's go that way.
[09:22.100 --> 09:22.720]  To the right?
[09:22.900 --> 09:23.280]  No.
[09:23.560 --> 09:26.640]  So they don't know how to revive us or they're just choosing not to do it?
[09:26.840 --> 09:30.240]  I think they couldn't figure it out for about 30 seconds and then gave up.
[09:30.800 --> 09:31.880]  There's something on the floor right there.
[09:32.080 --> 09:32.580]  I got it.
[09:33.060 --> 09:33.560]  Is it Eric?
[09:36.400 --> 09:37.120]  Another monkey?
[09:37.380 --> 09:37.680]  Another wild monkey.
[09:37.960 --> 09:40.800]  Maybe we should bank what we have real fast, Nick.
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.200]  I don't know if we can leave it there.
[09:44.840 --> 09:48.400]  Can't we drop it off and then have it banked and then we come...
[09:48.400 --> 09:49.400]  Or do we have to do it all at once?
[09:49.560 --> 09:50.700]  I think you have to have it all at once.
[09:50.880 --> 09:51.040]  Oh.
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.080]  Well, you would...
[09:52.080 --> 09:52.780]  Oh, here's a head.
[09:53.140 --> 09:53.760]  Is that Nick?
[10:00.600 --> 10:00.960]  Nick?
[10:01.860 --> 10:02.520]  Run away!
[10:05.200 --> 10:06.560]  Oh, what the fuck?
[10:06.780 --> 10:06.920]  What?
[10:10.740 --> 10:11.100]  Nick?
[10:11.860 --> 10:12.680]  He said wild.
[10:13.960 --> 10:16.160]  Hey, what's up, Geoff?
[10:16.640 --> 10:17.180]  Nick's alone.
[10:17.200 --> 10:17.240]  Hi, Geoff.
[10:17.520 --> 10:17.800]  Hi.
[10:18.500 --> 10:19.780]  Welcome to the death chat.
[10:20.320 --> 10:22.600]  You guys need to figure out how to revive us yet.
[10:22.860 --> 10:23.820]  Nick's about to die.
[10:24.680 --> 10:26.280]  He's being followed by a gnome.
[10:26.700 --> 10:27.460]  You little bastards!
[10:29.020 --> 10:30.800]  Oh, wait. No, I can break them.
[10:31.160 --> 10:31.840]  I can hurt them.
[10:33.160 --> 10:35.800]  Hi, welcome to death.
[10:36.980 --> 10:40.860]  Nick was like all squash small with his little head bouncing up and down.
[10:40.960 --> 10:41.300]  Wow.
[10:41.360 --> 10:43.280]  Like Judge Doom in Roger Rabbit.
[10:43.560 --> 10:44.640]  Like he was melting.
[10:45.200 --> 10:47.240]  Let's do it again.
[10:47.240 --> 10:48.960]  What the hell is this?
[10:49.220 --> 10:49.540]  Uh oh.
[10:49.680 --> 10:49.960]  Okay.
[10:50.600 --> 10:50.920]  Oh!
[10:51.320 --> 10:54.540]  Oh, we fight each other now for supremacy, I guess.
[10:54.600 --> 10:55.180]  How do I fight?
[10:55.720 --> 10:57.700]  I don't know.
[10:58.180 --> 10:58.480]  Oh!
[10:59.640 --> 11:00.960]  Oh, don't pang me.
[11:04.670 --> 11:06.270]  Oh, get lumped.
[11:07.030 --> 11:08.470]  You walloped me, man.
[11:08.710 --> 11:09.490]  Oh, what is this?
[11:10.710 --> 11:11.030]  Yeah.
[11:12.670 --> 11:13.490]  What do we do?
[11:20.570 --> 11:22.190]  Did my hammer go somewhere?
[11:22.270 --> 11:23.710]  Yeah, I just hit it with my baseball bat.
[11:23.710 --> 11:24.670]  I hit a home run, bitch.
[11:26.970 --> 11:27.730]  It's out of here.
[11:27.950 --> 11:28.270]  What's this?
[11:29.190 --> 11:29.510]  Oh!
[11:32.070 --> 11:32.930]  Did I win?
[11:36.990 --> 11:38.250]  The platform gave way.
[11:38.390 --> 11:39.070]  Everyone's a loser.
[11:40.310 --> 11:41.790]  I don't even know what we were trying to do there.
[11:41.890 --> 11:42.190]  Me neither.
[11:42.310 --> 11:44.130]  I think we were just trying to be the last one standing.
[11:44.730 --> 11:46.010]  So how do we resurrect each other?
[11:46.130 --> 11:49.010]  Yeah, we need to figure out how to resurrect each other and then we can play this game.
[11:50.490 --> 11:54.610]  It says, uh, you'll have to find the head and go and put it on an extraction point.
[11:55.790 --> 11:56.770]  Extraction point head.
[11:56.970 --> 11:59.550]  The extraction point's just right... it's this.
[12:00.570 --> 12:00.930]  Yeah.
[12:01.190 --> 12:01.830]  What is this?
[12:02.430 --> 12:03.710]  Something just flew in the air.
[12:04.370 --> 12:04.730]  What?
[12:05.070 --> 12:06.470]  This is the extraction point, Geoff.
[12:08.130 --> 12:08.490]  Geoff.
[12:09.190 --> 12:09.950]  Oh my god.
[12:10.050 --> 12:10.550]  Oh, hold on.
[12:10.630 --> 12:11.530]  You're not done yet, though.
[12:11.590 --> 12:15.790]  You'll still need to collect enough valuables to meet the quota for the extraction point you're using.
[12:15.870 --> 12:17.590]  Once you meet that number, the shutter will close.
[12:17.590 --> 12:18.890]  When it lifts again, your friend will be back.
[12:20.030 --> 12:22.210]  Oh, so if you die in the level, you're done.
[12:22.650 --> 12:23.870]  It's just until quota.
[12:25.270 --> 12:27.630]  And we were pretty close to quota.
[12:30.930 --> 12:32.330]  Nothing to grab in here.
[12:32.950 --> 12:35.910]  Yeah, shotgun ammo is a big pain in the ass.
[12:37.850 --> 12:39.010]  A little bit witchier, then.
[12:39.770 --> 12:40.850]  Oh yeah, this is a... ooh.
[12:41.850 --> 12:43.270]  This is a Harry Potter-esque level.
[12:43.590 --> 12:43.870]  Yeah.
[12:44.850 --> 12:45.930]  Ooh, look! Goblet!
[12:45.930 --> 12:46.940]  And, uh...
[12:47.450 --> 12:47.470]  Where?
[12:47.770 --> 12:48.110]  Over here.
[12:48.870 --> 12:49.770]  I'll get this.
[12:50.350 --> 12:51.570]  Yeah, I'll get the other one.
[12:52.190 --> 12:52.950]  Thank you.
[12:53.990 --> 12:55.630]  Oh, here's a $600 goblet.
[12:55.690 --> 12:56.070]  Don't worry.
[12:56.850 --> 12:57.850]  $69 goblet.
[12:59.570 --> 13:02.250]  Watching the numbers flash red with Geoff is great.
[13:04.310 --> 13:06.030]  Oh, that's a pricey booze, that one.
[13:06.070 --> 13:07.650]  Oh, boys! Oh, boys!
[13:08.590 --> 13:08.910]  What?
[13:09.070 --> 13:10.170]  We're being chased by something!
[13:11.050 --> 13:11.550]  I'm hiding!
[13:15.930 --> 13:16.510]  Ooh, a key.
[13:19.890 --> 13:20.650]  Ooh, a vase.
[13:22.690 --> 13:23.710]  Can I get this by myself?
[13:28.010 --> 13:28.370]  Oh!
[13:33.490 --> 13:33.850]  Shoot.
[13:35.430 --> 13:35.590]  What?
[13:35.890 --> 13:36.510]  Are you green?
[13:37.050 --> 13:37.730]  What color are you, Gavin?
[13:39.090 --> 13:39.850]  I don't know.
[13:40.050 --> 13:40.650]  Where'd that guy go?
[13:41.030 --> 13:42.330]  Oh no! Why are you in the goo?
[13:43.450 --> 13:44.650]  I don't know, I just got in it.
[13:45.590 --> 13:46.590]  Oh my god, Geoff!
[13:47.430 --> 13:48.270]  Geoff, are you okay?
[13:48.710 --> 13:50.550]  Yeah, I'm fine. I just got in the goo to see what happened.
[13:50.630 --> 13:50.910]  Oh, okay.
[13:51.290 --> 13:52.590]  It shot you out of the goo.
[13:53.150 --> 13:54.290]  Did you crash in the goo?
[13:54.290 --> 13:55.890]  I got in the goo and hit Q to hide.
[13:57.610 --> 13:58.350]  And then I jumped out.
[13:58.350 --> 13:58.810]  What's that noise?
[13:59.010 --> 13:59.890]  Oh, shit!
[14:00.130 --> 14:00.550]  Okay, cool.
[14:02.230 --> 14:02.430]  Dang, Gavin.
[14:02.430 --> 14:03.370]  Yeah, that messes you up.
[14:03.690 --> 14:03.990]  Yeah.
[14:04.730 --> 14:05.610]  I bet that's quite loud.
[14:07.110 --> 14:08.090]  Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
[14:08.450 --> 14:09.170]  Nick, how you doing?
[14:10.550 --> 14:10.870]  Ah!
[14:11.250 --> 14:12.650]  That's me, dipshit.
[14:13.010 --> 14:13.850]  I know, I'm scared.
[14:14.030 --> 14:15.050]  I was trying to scare you.
[14:16.250 --> 14:17.530]  Yeah, that's what you were doing.
[14:18.150 --> 14:18.550]  Yeah.
[14:19.430 --> 14:20.490]  There's nothing in here.
[14:21.450 --> 14:22.710]  I think there's stuff up here.
[14:23.550 --> 14:24.190]  Oh, wow.
[14:24.210 --> 14:24.990]  Yeah, toss that down.
[14:25.150 --> 14:26.370]  Should I bring the tray and hit the trolley?
[14:26.390 --> 14:27.350]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, bring it in.
[14:27.770 --> 14:29.090]  Yeah, yeah, bring the trolley.
[14:29.670 --> 14:29.930]  Ooh!
[14:30.070 --> 14:31.170]  Bring the pram.
[14:34.990 --> 14:35.390]  What?
[14:37.390 --> 14:37.750]  What?
[14:38.350 --> 14:39.330]  Oh, I see.
[14:39.510 --> 14:41.050]  This potion's a love potion.
[14:41.170 --> 14:42.310]  It made me say things about...
[14:42.310 --> 14:42.950]  I broke it.
[14:47.970 --> 14:49.230]  What do we got, fellas?
[14:49.750 --> 14:50.150]  Nothing.
[14:50.950 --> 14:53.330]  I spilled love potion number nine all over the place.
[14:54.190 --> 14:54.510]  Oh.
[14:55.410 --> 14:57.090]  Does that mean we're all randy now?
[14:58.290 --> 15:00.570]  Well, it did have me saying a love thing to Geoff.
[15:01.230 --> 15:01.470]  Oh.
[15:02.330 --> 15:03.230]  He touched me.
[15:04.270 --> 15:04.910]  I'm looking.
[15:05.290 --> 15:06.750]  Physically, he touched me emotionally.
[15:06.950 --> 15:07.430]  He touched my heart.
[15:07.590 --> 15:08.290]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:08.570 --> 15:09.070]  Don't be pervert.
[15:09.530 --> 15:10.150]  Yeah, come on, guys.
[15:10.390 --> 15:11.530]  Is there anything on this...
[15:11.530 --> 15:11.730]  Ah!
[15:11.970 --> 15:13.230]  I think there's something on this bed.
[15:13.350 --> 15:14.070]  Oh, I knocked a door open.
[15:14.070 --> 15:14.510]  Oh, shit.
[15:14.510 --> 15:14.650]  What?
[15:15.230 --> 15:15.950]  Take it.
[15:16.650 --> 15:17.790]  Oh, that you Geoffed it?
[15:17.870 --> 15:18.190]  Yeah, look at it.
[15:18.250 --> 15:18.850]  Oh, goddammit.
[15:19.410 --> 15:19.770]  Oh, no.
[15:19.790 --> 15:20.490]  There's nothing up there.
[15:20.830 --> 15:21.510]  Okay, there's nothing up there.
[15:21.610 --> 15:21.830]  It's okay.
[15:21.870 --> 15:22.350]  We're just running.
[15:22.630 --> 15:23.250]  Solid wood.
[15:23.350 --> 15:23.730]  It's gotta be...
[15:23.730 --> 15:23.990]  Ah!
[15:24.010 --> 15:24.370]  Snake!
[15:24.690 --> 15:25.450]  What the fuck?
[15:25.450 --> 15:26.490]  What the hell is that?
[15:26.990 --> 15:28.030]  Oh, it's a dead end!
[15:28.110 --> 15:28.470]  Give me...
[15:28.470 --> 15:28.710]  Ah!
[15:29.210 --> 15:29.910]  Oh, Geoff!
[15:31.670 --> 15:32.030]  Ah!
[15:32.390 --> 15:33.330]  I'm in its mouth!
[15:34.930 --> 15:36.010]  I'm in its mouth!
[15:36.110 --> 15:36.510]  What is going on?
[15:36.750 --> 15:37.750]  Oh, he's bumming!
[15:38.870 --> 15:40.130]  Geoff, you look like a freak!
[15:40.130 --> 15:40.830]  What are you doing?
[15:41.610 --> 15:42.570]  You're throwing up!
[15:43.730 --> 15:44.490]  Buff it up, Geoff!
[15:45.030 --> 15:48.450]  Oh, what the Christ is that?
[15:48.450 --> 15:49.010]  What is that?
[15:49.210 --> 15:50.390]  Nick, Nick, we gotta get out of here.
[15:50.510 --> 15:51.390]  Why do I have teeth?
[15:51.830 --> 15:52.430]  Under the bed!
[15:52.550 --> 15:52.630]  Under the bed!
[15:52.630 --> 15:52.890]  Under the bed!
[15:54.630 --> 15:55.530]  Oh, my god.
[15:56.630 --> 15:57.270]  Holy shit!
[15:57.510 --> 15:57.910]  I'm hiding.
[15:58.190 --> 15:59.010]  What happened to me?
[15:59.070 --> 16:01.510]  Your face went all demented and you have puke everywhere.
[16:01.790 --> 16:02.390]  Nick, did you hide?
[16:03.810 --> 16:04.130]  Okay.
[16:05.370 --> 16:07.650]  I hid, but I don't know...
[16:07.650 --> 16:08.370]  Is this guy around here?
[16:09.970 --> 16:10.570]  He's through the...
[16:10.570 --> 16:11.630]  He's through the double doors.
[16:11.670 --> 16:12.170]  I'm gonna go look.
[16:13.030 --> 16:13.350]  Okay.
[16:20.140 --> 16:21.000]  I have a head.
[16:23.220 --> 16:23.960]  That might be Geoff.
[16:23.960 --> 16:24.480]  That would be Gavin.
[16:24.720 --> 16:25.160]  Or Gavin?
[16:25.160 --> 16:25.900]  I think that's Gavin.
[16:26.000 --> 16:26.840]  Well, here's Geoff, then.
[16:27.660 --> 16:28.380]  Okay, get him.
[16:28.540 --> 16:29.380]  Well, they're hanging out.
[16:30.200 --> 16:30.860]  Good for them.
[16:30.940 --> 16:32.400]  They get to entertain each other, at least.
[16:32.780 --> 16:33.100]  Yep.
[16:33.800 --> 16:34.420]  All right, let's...
[16:38.060 --> 16:39.100]  We're halfway there.
[16:39.120 --> 16:40.160]  We just need five grand more.
[16:40.300 --> 16:40.780]  Oh, here we go.
[16:41.240 --> 16:42.200]  Here's 600 bucks.
[16:42.440 --> 16:43.900]  Here's 549 dollars.
[16:48.600 --> 16:49.760]  Here's 532 dollars.
[16:52.080 --> 16:52.720]  Oh, man.
[16:53.820 --> 16:56.900]  You wouldn't think bumping money would make anything happen, but then here we are.
[16:57.020 --> 16:57.620]  Shh, shh, shh, shh.
[16:57.640 --> 16:57.840]  What's up?
[16:58.240 --> 16:58.940]  Shh, shh, shh, shh.
[16:59.100 --> 16:59.660]  He's in there.
[16:59.820 --> 17:00.180]  He's in there.
[17:00.280 --> 17:00.480]  Okay.
[17:01.720 --> 17:03.360]  Yeah, but I'm hiding, and I'm scared.
[17:03.760 --> 17:04.280]  So now what?
[17:07.400 --> 17:08.740]  Oh, he's going to the next room.
[17:08.840 --> 17:09.040]  Okay.
[17:09.880 --> 17:11.820]  Oh, by the way, when you crouch, it turns off your flashlight.
[17:11.900 --> 17:12.500]  Yeah, I saw that.
[17:13.120 --> 17:13.880]  Oh, there's the...
[17:13.880 --> 17:16.840]  Oh, it's the monkey. That's what God has killed last time.
[17:17.240 --> 17:17.440]  Got it.
[17:18.520 --> 17:22.180]  Beware. I know from personal experience how you have to be careful with the monkey.
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.740]  Yeah, I saw. Oh, well, yeah.
[17:27.260 --> 17:28.020]  Can't tell what you mean.
[17:28.020 --> 17:29.660]  There's gotta be stuff around here. I want to be...
[17:30.840 --> 17:31.860]  I'm hiding under the table.
[17:32.100 --> 17:32.180]  Yeah.
[17:33.540 --> 17:35.420]  Is he coming through this way? I can't tell.
[17:36.080 --> 17:36.800]  He's so slow.
[17:37.040 --> 17:38.400]  Oh, he is. He's coming. He's coming.
[17:40.800 --> 17:41.700]  He looks slow.
[17:41.820 --> 17:42.840]  What the fuck?
[17:44.940 --> 17:46.240]  I want to kill him.
[17:47.340 --> 17:48.100]  Does he know we're here?
[17:48.120 --> 17:49.360]  Do you think I could take him in a one-on-one?
[17:50.520 --> 17:52.520]  I'm looking at you and you look so funny when you talk.
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.540]  Well, I'm having fun with my friends.
[17:56.180 --> 18:00.040]  You can go... you can go past him probably into that room and I'll distract him.
[18:00.480 --> 18:02.780]  You don't have to distract him. I think I can just crouch and go.
[18:03.480 --> 18:04.500]  I think he knows I'm here.
[18:04.720 --> 18:04.920]  Oh.
[18:05.940 --> 18:06.640]  So I'm gonna run.
[18:06.760 --> 18:06.900]  Ooh.
[18:08.240 --> 18:10.500]  There's a book. Two thousand bucks.
[18:11.380 --> 18:11.680]  Sweet.
[18:13.040 --> 18:13.360]  Uh...
[18:13.360 --> 18:14.740]  Oh, he's turning around.
[18:16.180 --> 18:18.100]  Just... just haul balls, Eric. Just haul balls.
[18:18.820 --> 18:19.320]  I'm hiding.
[18:22.760 --> 18:24.060]  This is tense, dude.
[18:24.080 --> 18:24.620]  Can he see me?
[18:24.740 --> 18:26.040]  He's massacring that book.
[18:26.140 --> 18:27.040]  Somebody. He sees you.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.040]  I don't think he saw me.
[18:29.560 --> 18:29.920]  You're right.
[18:30.860 --> 18:33.420]  Okay, so I have a book that's stashed under there.
[18:34.120 --> 18:36.260]  I'll grab that. I didn't see anything else in there to be honest with you.
[18:36.360 --> 18:36.580]  Nothing?
[18:37.080 --> 18:37.860]  I don't think so.
[18:39.400 --> 18:41.740]  Watching them walk around crouched is the funniest fucking thing.
[18:41.740 --> 18:43.020]  What's the screen? Why did it scream?
[18:43.480 --> 18:44.140]  Do you hear screaming?
[18:44.400 --> 18:44.820]  He's going...
[18:46.980 --> 18:48.020]  Oh, what the crazy...
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.780]  Ah! Ah! He got me! He got me!
[18:49.980 --> 18:50.440]  Ah! He got me!
[18:50.500 --> 18:50.880]  The book!
[18:51.380 --> 18:51.660]  The book!
[18:51.660 --> 18:52.100]  He's getting you.
[18:52.100 --> 18:52.420]  The book!
[18:52.500 --> 18:52.920]  He hurt me!
[18:53.440 --> 18:54.240]  The book, it hurts!
[18:54.520 --> 18:55.740]  Oh no, the book hurts you!
[18:58.440 --> 18:59.560]  Why did it attack you?
[18:59.860 --> 19:00.480]  I don't know.
[19:00.680 --> 19:02.040]  Oh, Eric, there's stuff up on the shelf.
[19:04.080 --> 19:04.960]  That goblet up there.
[19:06.440 --> 19:07.060]  You want to grab it?
[19:07.220 --> 19:08.260]  You get it. I got this one.
[19:08.380 --> 19:08.840]  Oh, you have the book?
[19:09.120 --> 19:09.320]  Okay.
[19:09.560 --> 19:09.920]  The book hurts.
[19:09.920 --> 19:10.500]  No, no, no. I can get it.
[19:11.440 --> 19:11.880]  The book hurts.
[19:11.880 --> 19:12.160]  The book hurts.
[19:12.320 --> 19:12.740]  It hurts.
[19:13.360 --> 19:14.160]  I'm down to 50.
[19:14.260 --> 19:16.780]  I have a feeling that Geoff and Gavin are very frustrated right now.
[19:19.520 --> 19:21.120]  Are we just gonna go?
[19:22.300 --> 19:23.580]  Yeah, he's going that way.
[19:23.680 --> 19:25.100]  We're going this way. We got the thing over here.
[19:25.120 --> 19:25.280]  Okay.
[19:25.840 --> 19:28.000]  We got 600 bucks on this thing.
[19:28.080 --> 19:28.960]  How much do we have in here?
[19:30.260 --> 19:30.520]  What?
[19:31.500 --> 19:31.820]  Ah!
[19:32.400 --> 19:32.720]  Oh no!
[19:32.720 --> 19:33.600]  What is that? Oh no, run!
[19:34.780 --> 19:35.060]  Oh!
[19:35.780 --> 19:37.520]  Eric, it's trying to get me under the bed!
[19:38.340 --> 19:38.900]  Nick, run.
[19:39.640 --> 19:41.260]  No, I'm okay. He can't get under here.
[19:41.260 --> 19:42.580]  Stupid book.
[19:43.400 --> 19:44.280]  Oh, he left.
[19:47.320 --> 19:47.680]  Eric?
[19:48.420 --> 19:49.440]  Yeah, I'm over here.
[19:49.540 --> 19:49.620]  Okay.
[19:50.860 --> 19:51.520]  Is he gone?
[19:51.700 --> 19:52.140]  Yeah, he's gone.
[19:52.780 --> 19:53.140]  Okay.
[19:54.400 --> 19:56.660]  Weird. I think that's the thing that makes Geoff throw up and die.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.940]  Okay, big monster man in that room.
[20:00.020 --> 20:00.720]  Let's take this.
[20:00.960 --> 20:01.180]  Okay.
[20:02.400 --> 20:04.200]  We got it. Do you want to try to take it back?
[20:04.260 --> 20:04.760]  What are we at?
[20:05.580 --> 20:07.560]  I think we need 400.
[20:07.760 --> 20:08.760]  Oh, we need another four.
[20:08.860 --> 20:10.720]  Oh my god. We need another $4,000.
[20:11.260 --> 20:13.720]  These guys are never coming back to life.
[20:18.240 --> 20:19.400]  Nick, are you still alive?
[20:20.180 --> 20:20.420]  Nick?
[20:21.320 --> 20:21.940]  Yeah, I'm okay.
[20:22.120 --> 20:22.340]  Okay.
[20:22.540 --> 20:23.220]  Big monster man.
[20:23.820 --> 20:24.980]  I'm gonna grab the monkey.
[20:26.260 --> 20:26.720]  Can you switch?
[20:26.840 --> 20:29.960]  Yeah, when that thing bit you, Geoff, and you started throwing up and your voice was a little funny.
[20:30.120 --> 20:30.460]  It was great.
[20:31.500 --> 20:32.660]  We're so close to the ship.
[20:32.920 --> 20:33.800]  Ah! What the?
[20:33.860 --> 20:34.160]  Ah!
[20:34.580 --> 20:36.020]  Oh, Nick, what killed you?
[20:36.340 --> 20:37.400]  I have no idea.
[20:37.840 --> 20:38.800]  He just exploded.
[20:39.300 --> 20:39.640]  Nick?
[20:41.600 --> 20:42.200]  Oh, boy.
[20:42.460 --> 20:43.280]  Eric doesn't know you've died.
[20:43.280 --> 20:45.040]  The real Nick is dead.
[20:45.560 --> 20:48.060]  All I have to remember him by is this monkey.
[20:49.820 --> 20:51.560]  Nick, we started two companies together.
[20:51.960 --> 20:53.420]  This is the representation of you.
[20:53.900 --> 20:56.400]  You rolled into a ball and it's got a snake to look like.
[20:56.740 --> 20:56.960]  Of you.
[20:57.580 --> 20:58.640]  That's all I have left.
[20:58.780 --> 20:59.500]  Oh, no! I threw it!
[21:02.960 --> 21:05.380]  I like it went from you to it real quick.
[21:05.400 --> 21:06.620]  Guys, I don't think you're coming back to life.
[21:07.640 --> 21:07.920]  Oh!
[21:08.560 --> 21:09.400]  Why did it glitch?
[21:10.580 --> 21:11.200]  What happened?
[21:14.720 --> 21:15.440]  Stop running.
[21:17.720 --> 21:18.380]  Uh-oh, Eric.
[21:18.480 --> 21:18.680]  Oh, fuck.
[21:18.680 --> 21:18.900]  What is that?
[21:18.900 --> 21:19.900]  He's gonna get the vomit monster.
[21:20.000 --> 21:20.880]  That's the thing that got me.
[21:21.660 --> 21:23.300]  Oh, you sounded hilarious, by the way.
[21:23.420 --> 21:23.860]  You can't get me down here.
[21:24.140 --> 21:26.220]  Guys, I know you're listening to me right now.
[21:26.480 --> 21:27.260]  And I know you can hear me.
[21:27.360 --> 21:29.440]  I'm really sorry that I'm not better at this.
[21:29.560 --> 21:31.080]  I apologize that you're dead.
[21:31.240 --> 21:34.080]  I wish there was a way for all of us to play this together.
[21:34.340 --> 21:35.440]  So that way you weren't dead.
[21:35.880 --> 21:37.240]  I just... I wish...
[21:37.860 --> 21:39.240]  I wish so much for that.
[21:39.460 --> 21:40.340]  And I'm very sorry.
[21:40.540 --> 21:42.680]  I'm gonna try to get seven thousand dollars.
[21:43.280 --> 21:44.320]  And see if I...
[21:44.320 --> 21:46.920]  See if anything happens where you come back to life.
[21:48.080 --> 21:49.740]  I have a feeling you won't.
[21:50.180 --> 21:54.620]  And again, I greatly apologize that I'm the one that you have to rely on.
[21:54.740 --> 21:55.860]  Eric, this is not my strong suit.
[21:56.700 --> 21:58.440]  This is definitely not my strong suit.
[21:58.640 --> 21:59.580]  This has been a two-inch time with Michael.
[22:00.020 --> 22:01.740]  Okay, so this is good?
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.340]  Nothing happens?
[22:04.340 --> 22:04.840]  You need to put...
[22:04.840 --> 22:06.060]  Nothing happens here?
[22:06.080 --> 22:06.860]  Twenty-five hundred dollars.
[22:06.960 --> 22:07.860]  I just have to put more money in.
[22:07.860 --> 22:08.540]  Oh my god.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.260]  Okay, so it does not matter that I put the card.
[22:13.960 --> 22:15.220]  Oh my god.
[22:16.060 --> 22:17.180]  Guys, I'm really...
[22:17.180 --> 22:18.180]  I apologize for this.
[22:18.240 --> 22:18.720]  This is bad.
[22:18.900 --> 22:19.640]  I'm really sorry.
[22:19.860 --> 22:20.820]  He's so close.
[22:21.080 --> 22:21.490]  This is...
[22:23.420 --> 22:24.260]  I just want to...
[22:24.260 --> 22:24.980]  I just want to say...
[22:24.980 --> 22:25.860]  Oh god, he's there!
[22:27.620 --> 22:28.580]  Can you get me under here?
[22:30.180 --> 22:31.480]  I die so fast.
[22:31.760 --> 22:33.280]  I want to live more than four minutes.
[22:33.960 --> 22:34.620]  Did you...
[22:34.620 --> 22:37.280]  Hopefully, you guys are being really entertaining right now.
[22:37.300 --> 22:38.040]  Did you hear Geoff?
[22:38.860 --> 22:39.780]  When he got...
[22:39.780 --> 22:40.080]  Possessed.
[22:40.680 --> 22:42.460]  Yeah, I saw his teeth and he was throwing up.
[22:42.460 --> 22:43.720]  I'm wondering if he can hear me.
[22:46.080 --> 22:47.500]  You're like, what's happening?
[22:50.640 --> 22:52.620]  I wasn't sure if something...
[22:52.620 --> 22:53.920]  If I got attacked briefly.
[22:54.280 --> 22:57.480]  Or if I like changed my view so that it was inside my head.
[22:57.580 --> 22:59.640]  Because all I could see was my gross teeth.
[22:59.960 --> 23:00.660]  It's a thousand dollars.
[23:00.860 --> 23:01.960]  Yeah, we can see them too.
[23:02.800 --> 23:04.660]  Is that the book that tried to eat you, Nick?
[23:04.660 --> 23:04.980]  Yes.
[23:06.180 --> 23:07.980]  The evil book that attacks you is a thousand dollars.
[23:07.980 --> 23:09.540]  It scared the shit out of me.
[23:10.100 --> 23:11.580]  It started just munching on the back of your head.
[23:11.960 --> 23:13.520]  This might bring me up to nine.
[23:14.660 --> 23:15.660]  He's almost there.
[23:18.240 --> 23:20.000]  We really broke a lot of shit.
[23:21.620 --> 23:23.500]  The love potion was three thousand dollars.
[23:23.820 --> 23:23.900]  Nine.
[23:24.220 --> 23:24.720]  Nine two.
[23:25.900 --> 23:26.900]  Honestly, I'm almost there.
[23:27.500 --> 23:28.840]  And I shattered it on a bed.
[23:29.560 --> 23:30.200]  What's that?
[23:30.380 --> 23:31.360]  Where else am I supposed to...
[23:31.360 --> 23:31.840]  No!
[23:39.520 --> 23:40.760]  Don't die. Don't die. Don't die.
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.260]  Don't die. Don't die.
[23:41.580 --> 23:42.680]  Don't die.
[23:42.780 --> 23:43.440]  Be alive.
[23:43.600 --> 23:44.220]  Don't die.
[23:44.600 --> 23:45.300]  Be alive.
[23:45.420 --> 23:45.820]  Be alive.
[23:45.920 --> 23:46.580]  Everything's okay.
[23:46.640 --> 23:47.080]  You're good.
[23:47.180 --> 23:48.300]  I can see my own teeth.
[23:48.420 --> 23:49.960]  Oh no, I can see my own teeth.
[23:50.600 --> 23:52.800]  Oh no, I can see my own teeth.
[23:53.980 --> 23:54.920]  Guys, I'm sorry.
[23:56.000 --> 23:56.660]  I thought...
[23:56.660 --> 23:57.520]  I thought I had it.
[23:57.580 --> 23:58.360]  I thought I was better.
[23:58.600 --> 23:59.580]  I thought I was the one.
[24:00.820 --> 24:01.620]  I apologize.
[24:03.260 --> 24:05.220]  I'm sorry I couldn't be the one to do it.
[24:07.860 --> 24:08.960]  He's so casual.
[24:10.280 --> 24:10.760]  Oh no.
[24:15.460 --> 24:18.120]  He keeps poking him with everything he's looking at.
[24:19.060 --> 24:19.840]  This sucks!
[24:20.920 --> 24:22.400]  Stop throwing up!
[24:23.920 --> 24:24.780]  We need to...
[24:24.780 --> 24:26.020]  We need to isolate that.
[24:26.060 --> 24:26.760]  That sucks.
[24:31.740 --> 24:34.420]  Oh, this is a good idea by him.
[24:35.240 --> 24:36.000]  Maybe it'll fix him.
[24:36.180 --> 24:36.360]  Oh!
[24:37.120 --> 24:37.400]  It did!
[24:37.660 --> 24:38.560]  Oh, it freed him!
[24:38.560 --> 24:39.240]  Oh, wow!
[24:39.500 --> 24:40.540]  That's how you get him out of here?
[24:41.100 --> 24:42.080]  Guys, I learned something.
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.080]  Guys, I learned something.
[24:43.560 --> 24:44.360]  We saw it.
[24:44.480 --> 24:45.960]  But I don't know where else to go.
[24:46.440 --> 24:47.040]  What is he holding?
[24:47.180 --> 24:48.220]  There's no other rooms.
[24:48.380 --> 24:48.980]  What am I missing?
[24:49.500 --> 24:50.360]  I don't know what that is.
[24:51.940 --> 24:52.620]  Oh, God.
[24:53.360 --> 24:53.860]  Let's go up high.
[24:57.420 --> 24:58.260]  Guys, I'm sorry.
[24:58.340 --> 25:00.820]  This is probably not the most thrilling thing for you guys to be doing.
[25:01.000 --> 25:01.760]  I really apologize.
[25:03.300 --> 25:04.320]  Stop apologizing, asshole.
[25:04.480 --> 25:05.220]  Stop apologizing.
[25:05.440 --> 25:06.220]  Just get the stuff.
[25:06.640 --> 25:08.060]  There was nothing up here, though.
[25:09.080 --> 25:10.400]  Anything under the beds?
[25:10.840 --> 25:10.960]  No.
[25:13.460 --> 25:14.520]  Nothing there.
[25:22.220 --> 25:23.460]  Nothing here.
[25:23.780 --> 25:24.440]  Nothing up there.
[25:26.260 --> 25:27.280]  Nothing around here.
[25:29.620 --> 25:34.200]  I wonder if he's supposed to launch from the cauldron up high.
[25:34.440 --> 25:35.740]  Did you see where else to go?
[25:35.740 --> 25:39.400]  I don't see where I'm missing 500 bucks or whatever.
[25:39.540 --> 25:42.320]  This has got to be Eric's personal helm.
[25:42.860 --> 25:43.700]  I think so.
[25:43.860 --> 25:46.860]  He's the one that enjoys recording in video games the least.
[25:47.180 --> 25:48.240]  And it's all him.
[25:48.800 --> 25:49.340]  Nobody move.
[25:49.520 --> 25:51.100]  He likes doing it with other people.
[25:51.420 --> 25:51.820]  And now he's...
[25:52.260 --> 25:53.460]  Boys, we're about to do this thing.
[25:53.720 --> 25:55.100]  Boys, we're about to do this thing.
[25:55.580 --> 25:56.440]  We're gonna make it.
[25:56.800 --> 25:57.240]  Oh, God.
[25:59.820 --> 26:01.400]  Boys, I'm bringing you back.
[26:01.880 --> 26:02.840]  That's still not enough, surely.
[26:03.560 --> 26:04.260]  Yeah, that's enough.
[26:04.300 --> 26:04.800]  Don't break it.
[26:05.180 --> 26:05.720]  He's got it.
[26:05.780 --> 26:06.480]  He's got 11,000.
[26:07.220 --> 26:08.140]  Oh, come on.
[26:08.240 --> 26:09.440]  I thought it was 12 for some reason.
[26:09.840 --> 26:11.260]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[26:11.260 --> 26:12.280]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[26:12.820 --> 26:13.540]  Come on.
[26:21.240 --> 26:21.600]  Awesome.
[26:23.300 --> 26:24.200]  What is that?
[26:24.360 --> 26:24.720]  What is that?
[26:24.840 --> 26:25.300]  What is that?
[26:27.200 --> 26:27.960]  Time to leave.
[26:28.180 --> 26:28.920]  The truck heals you.
[26:31.860 --> 26:32.840]  Are you guys back?
[26:34.640 --> 26:35.640]  Are you guys back?
[26:35.740 --> 26:36.400]  You did it, Eric.
[26:36.400 --> 26:37.400]  You did it.
[26:37.460 --> 26:37.780]  Yes.
[26:38.040 --> 26:38.680]  You did it, Eric.
[26:39.000 --> 26:39.920]  Oh, my God.
[26:39.940 --> 26:40.600]  Let's get out of here.
[26:40.940 --> 26:41.220]  Unbelievable.
[26:42.120 --> 26:42.460]  What the hell?
[26:42.500 --> 26:45.400]  Eric, when that thing took over your body, you were talking...
[26:46.520 --> 26:48.620]  It was so fucking funny.
[26:49.840 --> 26:51.300]  I found out you jumped...
[26:51.300 --> 26:54.560]  Geoff, when you jumped in that potion earlier, that's how you extracted it.
[26:54.580 --> 26:55.380]  That's so cool.
[26:55.500 --> 26:56.060]  Very cool.
[26:56.580 --> 26:58.420]  This game is awesome.
[26:58.720 --> 26:59.460]  I can't believe this.
[26:59.520 --> 27:00.040]  Let's keep going.
[27:00.380 --> 27:01.740]  Sorry you were dead for so long.
[27:02.620 --> 27:04.500]  I'm gonna live more than three minutes this time.
[27:04.600 --> 27:04.860]  Yes.
[27:04.860 --> 27:06.740]  So here we are at the shop.
[27:06.880 --> 27:08.500]  So we got a little bit of money.
[27:10.840 --> 27:15.260]  The thing I would recommend is a couple of folks can get a...
[27:15.260 --> 27:15.700]  Let's see.
[27:15.860 --> 27:16.420]  Where is it?
[27:17.200 --> 27:18.000]  Stamina upgrade.
[27:19.620 --> 27:22.950]  I'm gonna do a stamina upgrade and they definitely...
[27:23.780 --> 27:24.280]  Well, okay.
[27:24.300 --> 27:24.960]  Here's a couple of things.
[27:25.060 --> 27:25.600]  Check your health.
[27:26.500 --> 27:29.180]  Some of us who are hurt should get at least a small med kit.
[27:30.220 --> 27:30.600]  Okay.
[27:30.840 --> 27:31.200]  Or health pack.
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.360]  So I have 26 of 100 health, it looks like.
[27:35.420 --> 27:36.760]  So I get a small med kit.
[27:36.840 --> 27:38.180]  How do I use it, Nick?
[27:38.240 --> 27:38.640]  Do I have to...
[27:38.640 --> 27:39.360]  Oh, you take it over to this thing.
[27:39.360 --> 27:41.540]  You take it over to the register over here.
[27:41.600 --> 27:42.280]  So here's the thing.
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.820]  I think we're all on the same money amount.
[27:46.880 --> 27:47.300]  Yes, we are.
[27:47.340 --> 27:48.180]  Do we all have 11k?
[27:48.380 --> 27:49.240]  No, it's shared.
[27:50.140 --> 27:50.420]  Okay.
[27:51.300 --> 27:51.860]  Oh, shit.
[27:52.380 --> 27:53.620]  Yeah, I picked a stamina upgrade.
[27:53.620 --> 27:54.940]  I'm just gonna take a small health.
[27:55.360 --> 27:56.880]  I picked a health grade.
[27:57.380 --> 27:58.780]  What's the difference between big and small?
[27:58.780 --> 28:01.740]  Geoff, I'd put the upgrade back and just get health.
[28:02.500 --> 28:04.860]  There's a health pack over here.
[28:04.960 --> 28:06.280]  We're at 13k.
[28:06.400 --> 28:06.760]  Something...
[28:07.140 --> 28:08.440]  Okay, we're at 10k.
[28:08.480 --> 28:09.140]  Where's the health?
[28:09.920 --> 28:11.040]  I've put my health in.
[28:11.200 --> 28:11.840]  I'll tell you what, Geoff.
[28:11.840 --> 28:12.340]  You can take mine.
[28:14.160 --> 28:16.140]  I'm used to working in a deficit in this.
[28:16.240 --> 28:17.240]  So you take that small health kit.
[28:17.660 --> 28:18.280]  And we'll save the money.
[28:18.560 --> 28:19.040]  How much health have you got?
[28:20.380 --> 28:21.020]  26. You?
[28:22.000 --> 28:22.360]  26.
[28:22.640 --> 28:22.840]  Okay.
[28:23.380 --> 28:23.820]  I assume Geoff does as well.
[28:23.820 --> 28:24.740]  You guys are at 26 health?
[28:24.960 --> 28:25.320]  26.
[28:25.620 --> 28:25.740]  Yeah.
[28:26.160 --> 28:27.000]  Oh, no.
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.300]  You lived, so you have more, right?
[28:28.620 --> 28:29.360]  I'm at 100.
[28:29.960 --> 28:30.240]  Okay.
[28:30.280 --> 28:31.080]  That's a lot of health.
[28:31.180 --> 28:32.500]  We could just buy three healths.
[28:32.620 --> 28:33.060]  Uh, yeah.
[28:33.280 --> 28:33.560]  I...
[28:33.560 --> 28:36.240]  The stamina upgrade, I think, is gonna be the thing that's really gonna get us.
[28:36.340 --> 28:37.120]  I think we gotta...
[28:37.120 --> 28:37.340]  Yes.
[28:37.860 --> 28:38.300]  Oh, God.
[28:38.320 --> 28:40.100]  I would love to do 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[28:40.100 --> 28:40.840]  We can do two of those.
[28:40.880 --> 28:41.560]  Let's do two of those.
[28:41.600 --> 28:42.240]  I'll do the other one.
[28:42.280 --> 28:42.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:42.680 --> 28:43.540]  Because we...
[28:43.540 --> 28:44.860]  God, I wanna do a health upgrade.
[28:45.260 --> 28:47.420]  But if you guys need the health, then I don't...
[28:47.420 --> 28:48.260]  You know, it is what it is.
[28:48.260 --> 28:48.800]  They need the health.
[28:48.960 --> 28:49.380]  That's okay.
[28:49.720 --> 28:50.060]  All right.
[28:51.240 --> 28:51.960]  Let's do this.
[28:52.000 --> 28:52.520]  That's 10k.
[28:55.520 --> 28:56.720]  And let's hit the ship.
[28:56.820 --> 28:57.840]  I cannot...
[28:57.840 --> 28:58.240]  Oh, I could've died.
[28:58.540 --> 29:00.480]  I cannot believe you guys came back to life.
[29:00.580 --> 29:01.460]  I cannot believe it worked.
[29:02.320 --> 29:03.120]  That was incredible.
[29:03.280 --> 29:04.000]  It was awesome.
[29:05.400 --> 29:08.220]  We watched you apologize for like 10 minutes.
[29:08.360 --> 29:09.720]  We gotta open cabinets.
[29:10.200 --> 29:12.320]  Cabinets, cupboards, drawers, that kind of stuff.
[29:12.760 --> 29:13.440]  That's where...
[29:13.440 --> 29:13.620]  So...
[29:13.620 --> 29:14.500]  There's so much money in there.
[29:15.160 --> 29:17.080]  How do we apply the health we just got?
[29:17.240 --> 29:18.140]  Uh, we'll get it in a second.
[29:19.020 --> 29:19.240]  Yeah.
[29:19.860 --> 29:22.340]  Because I think it'll probably start in here.
[29:22.460 --> 29:22.500]  You know?
[29:22.500 --> 29:23.240]  You pick it up?
[29:23.380 --> 29:23.500]  Yeah.
[29:23.580 --> 29:26.540]  Like, you grab it with the right...
[29:26.540 --> 29:26.780]  Okay.
[29:27.080 --> 29:27.660]  Okay, thanks.
[29:27.700 --> 29:28.400]  I only see two.
[29:28.680 --> 29:28.960]  Pick it.
[29:29.020 --> 29:31.000]  Yeah, I gave you guys each one.
[29:31.140 --> 29:34.400]  I didn't take one because the other ones are too expensive for us to buy an additional
[29:34.400 --> 29:34.660]  one.
[29:34.760 --> 29:36.880]  You pick it up and then you hit E, I think.
[29:37.340 --> 29:37.500]  Yeah.
[29:37.720 --> 29:38.080]  There you go.
[29:38.120 --> 29:38.380]  Got it.
[29:38.940 --> 29:39.180]  Okay.
[29:40.440 --> 29:43.060]  Hey, Eric, when you were walking around by yourself, you would do...
[29:43.060 --> 29:47.860]  You would hold something in your right hand that looked like a little, I don't know, iPad
[29:47.860 --> 29:48.320]  or something.
[29:48.560 --> 29:48.980]  What was that?
[29:49.020 --> 29:49.220]  Do you know?
[29:49.400 --> 29:50.140]  Oh, hit tab.
[29:50.140 --> 29:50.220]  Yeah.
[29:50.780 --> 29:51.640]  All right, you guys ready?
[29:51.820 --> 29:52.480]  Should we go to the next spot?
[29:52.660 --> 29:52.820]  Oh, it's the map.
[29:53.500 --> 29:54.020]  It's the map.
[29:54.300 --> 29:55.500]  Oh, I didn't even know that existed.
[29:55.920 --> 29:56.160]  Yep.
[29:56.660 --> 29:57.100]  Hell yeah.
[29:57.200 --> 29:58.060]  I played the game.
[29:59.960 --> 30:02.980]  Yeah, the, uh, the is...
[30:02.980 --> 30:06.360]  It was showing me where stuff was, things that we'd run into already.
[30:06.620 --> 30:08.660]  And then you just, you just got to keep looking.
[30:09.600 --> 30:09.900]  Hetman.
[30:10.840 --> 30:11.420]  Hetman's Manor.
[30:11.500 --> 30:14.440]  Okay, so the shotgun guy may be here, so just watch.
[30:14.460 --> 30:15.540]  Oh, he's definitely here.
[30:16.420 --> 30:17.160]  What the fuck?
[30:17.720 --> 30:19.220]  And what do we do if we see him just run and hide?
[30:19.220 --> 30:19.820]  Uh, yeah.
[30:19.980 --> 30:20.480]  Yeah, I think, yeah.
[30:20.580 --> 30:21.820]  Hide and try to be quiet.
[30:22.820 --> 30:23.140]  Okay.
[30:23.380 --> 30:23.960]  In that moment.
[30:24.340 --> 30:27.060]  You can, you can, I think you can type and get away with it at that point.
[30:27.460 --> 30:27.760]  Yeah.
[30:28.640 --> 30:30.560]  Okay, let's, uh...
[30:30.560 --> 30:31.540]  You said hide and be quiet?
[30:31.700 --> 30:32.220]  Is that what you guys said?
[30:32.640 --> 30:32.920]  Yeah.
[30:33.740 --> 30:33.960]  Okay.
[30:39.100 --> 30:40.440]  I didn't like what you were doing.
[30:41.400 --> 30:42.500]  You ran me over, you bastard.
[30:46.360 --> 30:47.600]  You didn't even get to finish your sentence.
[30:47.600 --> 30:48.960]  There's already 500 bucks in here.
[30:49.020 --> 30:49.680]  Way to go, guys.
[30:49.800 --> 30:50.900]  Yeah, I dropped a goblin in there.
[30:50.940 --> 30:51.920]  Oh, I'm in the...
[30:51.920 --> 30:53.440]  Look, baby's in the pram.
[30:55.100 --> 30:56.200]  Goo goo ga ga.
[31:04.450 --> 31:11.350]  I want to play this game with Andrew because we are trying to work as a team and Andrew would be looking out for number one so bad.
[31:11.450 --> 31:11.970]  It's the only...
[31:11.970 --> 31:12.430]  Like, we're gonna...
[31:12.430 --> 31:12.990]  It's gonna be great.
[31:13.730 --> 31:14.230]  He'd be gone, dude.
[31:14.230 --> 31:15.090]  I watched a...
[31:15.090 --> 31:22.170]  I watched a pre-fuckface video with Andrew in it from years and years ago and he was the exact same way in Left 4 Dead.
[31:22.170 --> 31:23.510]  That's just the way he is.
[31:23.810 --> 31:24.570]  The way he is.
[31:24.730 --> 31:25.210]  The way he is.
[31:25.450 --> 31:26.090]  He's gotta win.
[31:26.510 --> 31:27.250]  At all costs.
[31:27.550 --> 31:28.490]  I'm with you, Nick.
[31:29.850 --> 31:30.950]  Where did Geoff go?
[31:31.230 --> 31:31.630]  Geoff?
[31:32.070 --> 31:32.470]  Geoff?
[31:37.170 --> 31:37.570]  Geoff?
[31:38.430 --> 31:38.830]  Geoff?
[31:39.650 --> 31:40.290]  Where you at, son?
[31:42.430 --> 31:42.830]  Okay.
[31:45.150 --> 31:45.970]  I hear him, too.
[31:46.390 --> 31:47.010]  Geoff, where are you?
[31:48.450 --> 31:48.850]  Geoff?
[31:49.270 --> 31:50.950]  Oh, Geoff broke 800 bucks.
[31:51.010 --> 31:51.230]  Stop.
[31:51.230 --> 31:52.750]  Oh, you can find a diamond.
[31:53.110 --> 31:53.910]  I found a diamond.
[31:54.170 --> 31:54.490]  Over here, Geoff.
[31:54.610 --> 31:54.830]  Over here.
[31:54.930 --> 31:55.330]  Follow me.
[31:55.470 --> 31:55.790]  Follow me.
[31:55.990 --> 31:56.450]  Over here, Geoff.
[31:56.510 --> 31:56.790]  To your right.
[31:58.830 --> 31:59.350]  Over here.
[31:59.830 --> 32:00.650]  Nice and easy.
[32:01.410 --> 32:02.650]  There you go.
[32:04.010 --> 32:04.910]  Nice job, dude.
[32:05.610 --> 32:06.050]  Thank you.
[32:06.470 --> 32:07.530]  I'm gonna bring this with us.
[32:08.870 --> 32:09.810]  Now in the fridge.
[32:10.010 --> 32:10.470]  Ooh, here we go.
[32:10.510 --> 32:10.750]  Here we go.
[32:10.770 --> 32:11.070]  Here we go.
[32:11.530 --> 32:12.150]  Is this a safe?
[32:12.170 --> 32:14.130]  Anything in here?
[32:14.590 --> 32:14.910]  No.
[32:15.530 --> 32:15.890]  Oh, shit.
[32:16.090 --> 32:16.310]  Hang on.
[32:16.910 --> 32:17.210]  Hang on.
[32:17.790 --> 32:18.090]  What's up?
[32:19.210 --> 32:19.790]  Just you?
[32:19.790 --> 32:20.270]  Ooh.
[32:21.370 --> 32:22.230]  Oh, there's a hide.
[32:22.290 --> 32:22.710]  Here we go.
[32:22.970 --> 32:23.330]  Here we go.
[32:24.410 --> 32:24.770]  Globes.
[32:26.530 --> 32:27.270]  Oh, yeah.
[32:27.430 --> 32:28.950]  $1,900 globes, baby.
[32:29.490 --> 32:30.210]  $1,900.
[32:30.750 --> 32:30.930]  Fuck.
[32:30.930 --> 32:31.290]  Hey!
[32:31.450 --> 32:32.230]  Oh, shit.
[32:32.250 --> 32:32.810]  What'd you do?
[32:32.930 --> 32:33.230]  What happened?
[32:34.150 --> 32:35.930]  That's why I did it in the back of the head with my globes.
[32:38.790 --> 32:39.770]  We're doing up to 6,000.
[32:40.630 --> 32:41.430]  We're close, boys.
[32:41.810 --> 32:42.010]  Cool.
[32:42.070 --> 32:42.430]  Way to go.
[32:43.490 --> 32:43.750]  Okay.
[32:43.810 --> 32:44.470]  So now, Nick.
[32:44.610 --> 32:48.590]  Guys, you'll notice that in the top right, it's 0 for 2 instead of 0 for 1.
[32:48.590 --> 32:51.090]  So there's two extraction points in this one.
[32:51.170 --> 32:51.610]  Oh, cool.
[32:51.730 --> 32:53.690]  So we do one, and then we have a secondary.
[32:53.690 --> 32:54.210]  Do we do the other?
[32:54.470 --> 32:54.630]  Okay.
[32:54.950 --> 32:58.150]  So we need to get this as close to 9,000 as we can.
[32:58.990 --> 32:59.270]  Yeah.
[33:00.430 --> 33:01.930]  I don't think it takes all of it.
[33:02.090 --> 33:04.290]  I think it automatically transfers some of it over.
[33:07.230 --> 33:08.690]  Haven't run into anything yet.
[33:09.010 --> 33:11.210]  Knock on wood, but like...
[33:11.210 --> 33:13.930]  Is the cost of health the same every time?
[33:14.110 --> 33:16.010]  Like, with nine grand, would we get three healths?
[33:16.310 --> 33:16.610]  Yes.
[33:17.290 --> 33:18.450]  Yeah, that all stays the same.
[33:19.990 --> 33:20.790]  Oh, shit.
[33:20.870 --> 33:21.730]  Did you just run him over?
[33:22.690 --> 33:22.810]  Yeah.
[33:22.970 --> 33:23.250]  A little bit.
[33:23.370 --> 33:24.770]  The whole car bounced in the air.
[33:25.030 --> 33:25.710]  Mama, why?
[33:27.910 --> 33:29.190]  I got a good one.
[33:30.350 --> 33:31.150]  No touchy.
[33:31.270 --> 33:31.830]  Watch out.
[33:31.910 --> 33:32.230]  No touchy.
[33:33.110 --> 33:33.790]  Gavin, come here.
[33:33.810 --> 33:34.230]  Be careful.
[33:34.430 --> 33:34.730]  Stop.
[33:35.430 --> 33:35.890]  Gavin, stop.
[33:38.230 --> 33:38.810]  Hey, dude.
[33:38.910 --> 33:40.030]  You were MVP last round.
[33:40.110 --> 33:40.510]  Nice job.
[33:41.310 --> 33:42.830]  Hey, I'm just glad you're back.
[33:44.510 --> 33:45.170]  Oh, no.
[33:49.290 --> 33:50.290]  Is there anywhere to hide?
[33:50.470 --> 33:50.870]  Oh, no.
[33:50.890 --> 33:51.710]  There's nowhere to hide.
[33:56.280 --> 33:56.640]  Guys?
[33:58.240 --> 34:00.120]  All right, I'll put this on the sad thing.
[34:00.600 --> 34:00.760]  Yeah.
[34:01.620 --> 34:03.340]  That'll bring him back to life, right?
[34:04.280 --> 34:06.240]  Well, it'll make us leave, and then they'll come back today.
[34:06.500 --> 34:06.720]  Yeah.
[34:07.420 --> 34:08.160]  But what killed him?
[34:08.160 --> 34:08.860]  I didn't even see it.
[34:09.620 --> 34:09.900]  I don't know.
[34:09.960 --> 34:10.700]  They didn't sound good.
[34:11.360 --> 34:11.760]  I'm alive.
[34:12.300 --> 34:12.920]  Oh, Nick's alive.
[34:13.100 --> 34:13.300]  Eric's alive.
[34:16.850 --> 34:17.210]  Eric?
[34:17.930 --> 34:18.550]  I'm alive.
[34:18.630 --> 34:18.970]  Hang on.
[34:19.710 --> 34:20.330]  Where's Nick?
[34:22.070 --> 34:22.930]  Be careful of this.
[34:23.430 --> 34:24.630]  Nick said it'll kill you.
[34:24.650 --> 34:24.950]  Yeah.
[34:26.250 --> 34:27.690]  Hell yeah, we did it.
[34:27.890 --> 34:28.290]  Okay.
[34:28.730 --> 34:30.730]  I wish I'd high five you, but we probably hurt each other.
[34:33.530 --> 34:35.650]  You must clear all of them to leave.
[34:35.770 --> 34:35.990]  Okay.
[34:38.850 --> 34:39.650]  Hey, morons.
[34:40.230 --> 34:41.450]  Why did you do that without Nick?
[34:41.790 --> 34:42.550]  To bring him back?
[34:44.530 --> 34:45.590]  Did you bring him back?
[34:45.970 --> 34:46.250]  No.
[34:47.430 --> 34:48.170]  Cool, man.
[34:50.230 --> 34:50.890]  Well, where is it?
[34:51.630 --> 34:52.030]  Yes.
[34:52.030 --> 34:52.490]  Hang on.
[34:52.530 --> 34:52.690]  Stop.
[34:52.770 --> 34:52.910]  Stop.
[34:53.010 --> 34:53.110]  Stop.
[34:53.150 --> 34:53.350]  Stop.
[34:53.930 --> 34:54.170]  All right.
[34:54.190 --> 34:55.310]  We've got to get his head, right?
[34:55.490 --> 34:56.730]  Yeah, I know.
[34:57.070 --> 34:57.670]  Do you know?
[34:58.090 --> 35:00.370]  Well, we have to hit both extractions anyway, don't we?
[35:00.530 --> 35:00.810]  Yeah.
[35:00.870 --> 35:02.310]  We still have a billion dollars to get.
[35:02.470 --> 35:05.050]  Yes, but I think we could have gotten him back.
[35:06.290 --> 35:07.170]  They sure could have.
[35:07.590 --> 35:08.610]  With that extraction point.
[35:08.770 --> 35:10.490]  Oh, well, he should have been alive and told us.
[35:10.490 --> 35:12.810]  I forgot about the head part.
[35:14.070 --> 35:15.910]  In spirit, I was trying to resurrect him.
[35:16.190 --> 35:17.210]  Oh, shit.
[35:17.330 --> 35:17.990]  Come on, man.
[35:19.850 --> 35:20.250]  All right.
[35:20.250 --> 35:20.610]  Which way?
[35:21.870 --> 35:22.510]  Follow me.
[35:22.530 --> 35:23.390]  Let's go this way.
[35:23.590 --> 35:24.030]  What killed him?
[35:24.590 --> 35:25.190]  I don't know.
[35:25.250 --> 35:26.590]  There's something lurking around here.
[35:27.710 --> 35:28.030]  Yeah.
[35:28.570 --> 35:29.210]  Gavin, here.
[35:29.410 --> 35:30.010]  I'm going to go in first.
[35:30.010 --> 35:31.370]  Gavin's a menace with that fucking cart.
[35:31.510 --> 35:32.130]  But thank you for pushing it.
[35:32.130 --> 35:32.790]  Do you want to use the cart?
[35:32.910 --> 35:33.290]  I do appreciate it.
[35:33.390 --> 35:34.110]  I do appreciate it.
[35:34.270 --> 35:34.690]  Is there anything in your cabinets?
[35:34.690 --> 35:35.910]  I'd rather get hit by it than push it.
[35:36.590 --> 35:38.810]  It feels like bitch work a little bit, but I'm happy to do it.
[35:39.010 --> 35:39.130]  Yeah.
[35:39.410 --> 35:39.710]  Well, here's it.
[35:40.090 --> 35:42.330]  We've got to look up high and in cabinets.
[35:42.330 --> 35:43.150]  Nothing up high.
[35:43.590 --> 35:43.730]  All right.
[35:43.790 --> 35:43.990]  Hang on.
[35:44.030 --> 35:44.270]  Hang on.
[35:44.590 --> 35:44.930]  Hang on.
[35:45.170 --> 35:47.630]  I can't believe I wasted Nick's head extraction.
[35:48.430 --> 35:50.550]  Well, it's a learning process.
[35:51.750 --> 35:52.030]  Yeah.
[35:52.970 --> 35:54.390]  Yeah, you know, you hate to see it.
[35:54.430 --> 35:54.970]  Oh, here we go.
[35:55.010 --> 35:55.930]  Here we go.
[35:56.730 --> 35:57.150]  All right.
[35:57.190 --> 35:57.650]  Hang on.
[35:58.510 --> 35:59.670]  Here comes 500 bucks.
[36:00.690 --> 36:01.250]  Don't move.
[36:04.450 --> 36:05.010]  500 bucks.
[36:05.310 --> 36:06.690]  How come it doesn't tell us how much we need?
[36:09.890 --> 36:10.170]  What?
[36:10.890 --> 36:11.150]  Oh.
[36:11.790 --> 36:11.910]  What?
[36:12.270 --> 36:13.630]  How come it doesn't tell us how much we need?
[36:13.710 --> 36:14.690]  It just says one of two, right?
[36:15.450 --> 36:17.010]  Well, I think we've got all the money we need.
[36:17.070 --> 36:18.350]  We can just go and extract if we want.
[36:18.630 --> 36:19.010]  Hold on.
[36:19.010 --> 36:19.650]  I got more money.
[36:19.830 --> 36:21.510]  I definitely want more money.
[36:21.750 --> 36:22.610]  Yeah, money's good.
[36:23.850 --> 36:26.110]  Who's breaking a bunch of shit over there?
[36:27.310 --> 36:28.290]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[36:29.550 --> 36:30.690]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[36:38.170 --> 36:39.570]  It's gone up like a balloon.
[36:39.910 --> 36:42.110]  It exploded.
[36:46.610 --> 36:49.310]  You shoved it in my eyes and it went all around the room.
[36:53.470 --> 36:56.470]  Hey, check out your map real quick.
[36:57.130 --> 37:00.310]  There's a question mark room that we haven't been to yet.
[37:00.430 --> 37:01.270]  I think that's what this is.
[37:02.770 --> 37:04.050]  Question mark is...
[37:04.050 --> 37:04.750]  What is that?
[37:04.770 --> 37:05.830]  Just where we haven't been?
[37:05.850 --> 37:07.050]  Just where we haven't been yet.
[37:08.110 --> 37:08.630]  Through here?
[37:08.950 --> 37:09.190]  Yeah.
[37:11.410 --> 37:11.730]  So...
[37:11.730 --> 37:13.350]  The bottle was trying to lead us into this room.
[37:13.590 --> 37:15.670]  So you see this cabinet? See how it's not blocked?
[37:15.910 --> 37:17.290]  Yeah, you can open it and see if there...
[37:17.290 --> 37:17.910]  Oh, I got a ring.
[37:18.710 --> 37:19.350]  Okay, here we go.
[37:19.470 --> 37:20.450]  What's in this? Can you guys look in here?
[37:20.750 --> 37:21.210]  I can't see.
[37:21.630 --> 37:21.950]  Boxing.
[37:22.150 --> 37:22.330]  What?
[37:22.850 --> 37:24.910]  I've opened it, but I can't see down without shutting it.
[37:24.970 --> 37:25.490]  Is there anything in there?
[37:27.890 --> 37:28.210]  No.
[37:31.030 --> 37:31.350]  Lame.
[37:31.990 --> 37:32.170]  Yeah.
[37:33.490 --> 37:34.450]  Okay, here I come.
[37:36.870 --> 37:37.510]  Good slide.
[37:37.510 --> 37:39.630]  Lost $100 on that.
[37:39.770 --> 37:41.390]  This plate is almost three grand.
[37:42.110 --> 37:43.350]  This plate is $1,200.
[37:44.050 --> 37:44.970]  Don't drop it. Don't drop it.
[37:44.970 --> 37:46.050]  Don't. Don't drop it.
[37:51.190 --> 37:52.570]  Dude, there's a TV.
[37:53.310 --> 37:54.070]  $7,000.
[37:55.150 --> 37:55.430]  Hang on.
[37:55.430 --> 37:56.190]  Can you lift the TV?
[37:56.270 --> 37:57.550]  Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[37:57.670 --> 37:59.250]  Because everyone's going to try to get involved.
[37:59.630 --> 38:00.410]  We need to...
[38:00.410 --> 38:01.970]  We need to open this door.
[38:02.830 --> 38:03.210]  Yeah.
[38:03.370 --> 38:04.790]  And then two of us get the TV.
[38:04.990 --> 38:05.690]  I'm going to be one.
[38:05.850 --> 38:07.310]  Why don't we just bring the car in here?
[38:08.250 --> 38:09.790]  Because two of us still need to lift it.
[38:09.810 --> 38:10.910]  Okay, I get what you're saying.
[38:12.410 --> 38:13.070]  Here we go.
[38:13.630 --> 38:13.870]  Ready?
[38:14.870 --> 38:16.490]  Big lift, big lift, big lift.
[38:16.590 --> 38:17.130]  Here we go.
[38:17.290 --> 38:17.590]  All right.
[38:17.730 --> 38:18.490]  Follow me, baby.
[38:18.930 --> 38:19.750]  Just like that.
[38:20.110 --> 38:21.090]  Nice and simple.
[38:21.190 --> 38:21.630]  All right.
[38:21.730 --> 38:22.230]  Up a little.
[38:22.670 --> 38:22.930]  To me.
[38:23.210 --> 38:23.570]  To you.
[38:24.110 --> 38:24.510]  To me.
[38:25.910 --> 38:26.330]  To you.
[38:26.410 --> 38:26.690]  All right.
[38:26.910 --> 38:28.170]  And let go.
[38:30.250 --> 38:31.950]  Can we get it in there a little bit more?
[38:32.250 --> 38:34.030]  Nick's head is kind of rolling it a little bit.
[38:34.370 --> 38:34.890]  Hang on.
[38:35.310 --> 38:35.670]  Oh, wait.
[38:35.670 --> 38:38.130]  I'll reposition Nick's head so he can wear it.
[38:38.130 --> 38:38.530]  There we go.
[38:38.730 --> 38:39.170]  There we go.
[38:39.410 --> 38:39.730]  There we go.
[38:40.350 --> 38:42.550]  Okay, I think at this point, after the...
[38:42.550 --> 38:43.030]  We gotta go.
[38:43.570 --> 38:44.910]  Yeah, we should take off.
[38:45.350 --> 38:45.510]  Yeah.
[38:51.090 --> 38:52.530]  Okay, where's the extraction point?
[38:53.630 --> 38:55.950]  We gotta get to the other one, so it's gonna be a question mark, I assume.
[38:56.210 --> 38:57.170]  Unless Nick found it.
[38:57.190 --> 38:57.670]  I think...
[38:58.890 --> 39:01.270]  It looks like there's a question mark up to the left.
[39:01.290 --> 39:03.770]  Yeah, it's behind you, Gavin, is where we need to go.
[39:03.770 --> 39:05.470]  It's at that red circle.
[39:05.710 --> 39:06.870]  Or that red square on the map.
[39:07.010 --> 39:07.910]  The red square was the...
[39:07.910 --> 39:07.970]  This way?
[39:08.090 --> 39:08.750]  I think it was the...
[39:08.750 --> 39:10.290]  I think the red square is the first extraction point.
[39:10.290 --> 39:10.750]  Oh, it's the first one?
[39:10.910 --> 39:11.090]  Yeah.
[39:11.170 --> 39:11.410]  Okay.
[39:11.610 --> 39:12.710]  Yeah, so it looks like it's this way.
[39:13.030 --> 39:14.770]  Should we get to the left?
[39:16.230 --> 39:18.210]  Yeah, up here to the right and then to the left.
[39:18.590 --> 39:18.910]  Right?
[39:19.850 --> 39:20.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:20.430 --> 39:21.990]  We gotta go up this way and to, like, the left.
[39:22.950 --> 39:23.190]  Oh.
[39:24.010 --> 39:25.170]  There's all kinds of stuff in here.
[39:25.190 --> 39:25.530]  How you doing, Gavin?
[39:27.730 --> 39:28.330]  Oh, God.
[39:31.390 --> 39:31.630]  Gavin!
[39:32.310 --> 39:32.790]  Geoff's dead.
[39:33.250 --> 39:33.370]  Oh!
[39:35.410 --> 39:36.050]  Jesus Christ!
[39:36.050 --> 39:40.410]  I missed how you died!
[39:41.410 --> 39:42.130]  Oh, God!
[39:43.470 --> 39:44.130]  What got you?
[39:44.550 --> 39:46.510]  Some giant face, dude.
[39:46.870 --> 39:47.090]  Hang on.
[39:47.290 --> 39:48.610]  Just a giant face.
[39:48.630 --> 39:49.050]  I'm coming.
[39:49.490 --> 39:50.070]  Yeah, where are...
[39:50.070 --> 39:50.730]  Where did you go?
[39:52.890 --> 39:53.250]  I...
[39:53.250 --> 39:54.310]  How come I can't hear you now?
[39:55.290 --> 39:55.830]  Oh, okay.
[39:55.870 --> 39:56.430]  Stay where you are.
[39:56.510 --> 39:57.030]  Stay where you are.
[39:58.630 --> 40:00.170]  I'm gonna make a siren noise.
[40:00.210 --> 40:01.110]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:01.110 --> 40:01.430]  Shut up.
[40:01.650 --> 40:02.270]  Shut up.
[40:02.610 --> 40:03.170]  Geoff is dead.
[40:03.870 --> 40:04.550]  Geoff is dead.
[40:04.570 --> 40:05.010]  Wait, what?
[40:05.590 --> 40:06.030]  Geoff is dead.
[40:06.030 --> 40:06.630]  Geoff died.
[40:07.270 --> 40:07.970]  From what?
[40:08.070 --> 40:08.410]  I don't know.
[40:08.490 --> 40:09.290]  Something attacked him.
[40:10.190 --> 40:10.770]  Oh, no!
[40:10.890 --> 40:11.250]  Get...
[40:11.250 --> 40:11.950]  Let's get out of here.
[40:12.070 --> 40:14.430]  No, it's, uh...
[40:14.790 --> 40:16.070]  It's gotta be up this way.
[40:16.570 --> 40:17.090]  I'm gonna crouch.
[40:17.310 --> 40:17.730]  You took...
[40:17.730 --> 40:18.290]  You...
[40:18.290 --> 40:18.770]  You came...
[40:18.770 --> 40:19.810]  You got his head, right?
[40:19.890 --> 40:20.350]  No, no, no.
[40:20.390 --> 40:21.750]  I just know he died.
[40:21.850 --> 40:23.190]  I don't know what from or anything.
[40:23.530 --> 40:25.110]  Oh, shit sauce.
[40:25.450 --> 40:26.230]  I think it's this way.
[40:26.410 --> 40:28.450]  There's some shit on the floor in this next room.
[40:28.630 --> 40:28.790]  Yeah.
[40:29.010 --> 40:30.770]  And I think that's what he died for.
[40:32.150 --> 40:32.730]  Oh, no.
[40:33.110 --> 40:33.330]  Yeah.
[40:33.370 --> 40:33.650]  Hang on.
[40:33.650 --> 40:34.330]  I'll go look.
[40:34.430 --> 40:34.690]  I'll go look.
[40:38.200 --> 40:39.180]  Oh, oh, oh.
[40:40.360 --> 40:41.280]  There's something red.
[40:41.380 --> 40:41.660]  Is that...
[40:41.660 --> 40:43.160]  Is that his head or is that something else?
[40:48.610 --> 40:49.550]  I think that's his head.
[40:49.730 --> 40:49.990]  Okay.
[40:50.410 --> 40:51.130]  I got his head.
[40:52.490 --> 40:52.810]  Excellent.
[40:58.590 --> 40:59.230]  We gotta...
[40:59.230 --> 41:00.710]  We gotta get out of here, man.
[41:01.050 --> 41:02.190]  Oh, oh, oh!
[41:02.190 --> 41:02.730]  Oh, shit!
[41:02.950 --> 41:03.470]  Gavin, don't go this way!
[41:03.490 --> 41:04.290]  Gavin, don't go this way!
[41:07.200 --> 41:07.940]  Get under the bed!
[41:08.020 --> 41:08.480]  Get under the bed!
[41:08.480 --> 41:09.020]  Oh, God.
[41:09.480 --> 41:10.000]  Shut up.
[41:10.040 --> 41:10.680]  Do you see that?
[41:10.980 --> 41:11.440]  Shut the fuck up.
[41:11.480 --> 41:11.800]  Shut up.
[41:14.580 --> 41:15.100]  Quiet.
[41:15.800 --> 41:16.820]  That's you.
[41:19.400 --> 41:21.000]  Where do we extract?
[41:23.540 --> 41:24.720]  It's gotta be up here.
[41:24.800 --> 41:24.980]  Okay.
[41:25.340 --> 41:27.340]  I'm gonna keep creeping and looking to...
[41:27.340 --> 41:27.940]  Oh, nope, nope, nope.
[41:27.940 --> 41:28.300]  He's coming.
[41:30.140 --> 41:30.480]  Uh.
[41:30.760 --> 41:31.280]  Out.
[41:31.500 --> 41:31.840]  At.
[41:32.100 --> 41:32.340]  F.
[41:34.180 --> 41:34.700]  Shut.
[41:38.220 --> 41:39.020]  Shut.
[41:39.580 --> 41:40.660]  The fuck up.
[41:40.660 --> 41:43.120]  Eric's the loudest person on earth in this situation.
[41:43.260 --> 41:44.280]  He is, dude!
[41:46.640 --> 41:47.480]  What'd you say?
[41:48.100 --> 41:48.240]  Shut.
[41:48.640 --> 41:51.880]  The fuck up.
[41:53.350 --> 41:53.710]  At.
[41:53.830 --> 41:54.350]  Game.
[41:54.850 --> 41:55.430]  Doesn't.
[41:55.690 --> 41:56.010]  Like.
[41:56.230 --> 41:56.630]  Our.
[41:57.070 --> 41:57.430]  Shit.
[41:59.230 --> 42:00.030]  Shut.
[42:00.510 --> 42:00.550]  Shut.
[42:00.550 --> 42:00.630]  The fuck up.
[42:03.870 --> 42:04.330]  Shut.
[42:04.330 --> 42:04.370]  The fuck up.
[42:08.650 --> 42:09.270]  Shut.
[42:16.910 --> 42:18.730]  Okay, I'm going to go and creep and look.
[42:20.490 --> 42:21.550]  I'm just going to keep moving.
[42:26.570 --> 42:28.810]  There's got to be an extraction point around here.
[42:29.050 --> 42:29.970]  There has to be.
[42:31.650 --> 42:33.010]  Oh, what the fuck?
[42:33.130 --> 42:34.990]  Oh my God.
[42:35.010 --> 42:35.970]  Derek, get me down!
[42:37.370 --> 42:37.810]  Derek!
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.220]  What the fuck was that?
[42:53.090 --> 42:53.730]  Erickson?
[42:55.790 --> 42:57.870]  Yeah, I got sucked by an eye!
[43:00.130 --> 43:01.670]  I'm back under the bed!
[43:04.770 --> 43:06.450]  I found the extraction point.
[43:07.010 --> 43:07.790]  Oh, cool.
[43:08.110 --> 43:10.550]  How do we get past this eyeball of...
[43:10.550 --> 43:10.830]  Heck.
[43:10.910 --> 43:12.070]  I don't know.
[43:12.070 --> 43:13.270]  I think we just have to go.
[43:15.590 --> 43:16.890]  You wanna grab it and make it happen?
[43:20.230 --> 43:21.310]  Yeah, let me put a bit back in.
[43:21.450 --> 43:21.610]  Okay.
[43:21.830 --> 43:22.470]  Heh heh heh heh.
[43:24.610 --> 43:24.930]  Goddammit.
[43:28.360 --> 43:30.400]  Could not be getting more text messages right now. Great.
[43:32.300 --> 43:32.620]  Okay.
[43:32.980 --> 43:33.140]  Alright.
[43:33.280 --> 43:34.140]  Uh, where's Geoff?
[43:34.280 --> 43:35.040]  It's... what do you mean?
[43:35.880 --> 43:36.440]  Where's his head?
[43:36.740 --> 43:37.720]  It should be in there, isn't it?
[43:38.440 --> 43:38.980]  Oh, is it?
[43:39.160 --> 43:40.440]  I thought it was. Is it not?
[43:40.680 --> 43:41.400]  Oh, fuck.
[43:41.560 --> 43:42.220]  It's some rummage.
[43:42.500 --> 43:42.820]  Hang on.
[43:42.820 --> 43:43.740]  It might have fallen out.
[43:43.900 --> 43:45.260]  It did. It's over here. It's over here. I got it.
[43:45.420 --> 43:45.620]  Okay.
[43:47.860 --> 43:48.600]  Okay, I got it.
[43:48.840 --> 43:51.320]  I think... I think that thing, like, pushed it or something.
[43:51.320 --> 43:52.220]  I think so.
[43:53.060 --> 43:53.300]  Okay.
[43:53.400 --> 43:53.900]  It's a big head.
[43:54.260 --> 43:54.800]  Okay, here I come.
[43:55.740 --> 43:56.440]  Okay, Geoff is in.
[43:56.920 --> 43:57.260]  Okay.
[43:57.480 --> 43:59.480]  Okay, how's... GTF the goddamn admin.
[43:59.920 --> 44:00.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:01.020 --> 44:01.360]  Uh...
[44:01.360 --> 44:02.000]  Ooh!
[44:03.200 --> 44:03.720]  You're okay.
[44:04.380 --> 44:04.860]  This way?
[44:05.220 --> 44:07.220]  Uh, this way and then to the left.
[44:09.140 --> 44:09.760]  Yeah, left.
[44:12.220 --> 44:13.180]  That's it. That's the room.
[44:13.760 --> 44:13.880]  Actually...
[44:13.880 --> 44:16.040]  Before you put it all the way in. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
[44:16.040 --> 44:16.340]  Hang on.
[44:16.680 --> 44:17.180]  What's that noise?
[44:17.600 --> 44:17.900]  It's me.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.160]  It's like a boon noise.
[44:21.160 --> 44:22.520]  Yeah, it's... it's okay. It's a boon.
[44:23.040 --> 44:24.000]  Okay, push it in. Push it in.
[44:27.900 --> 44:29.020]  Nice. That'll bring him back, too.
[44:29.160 --> 44:30.380]  Look out. Step back. Step back. Step back.
[44:30.880 --> 44:31.740]  This thing will stomp you.
[44:31.820 --> 44:31.920]  Oh, a hole?
[44:32.400 --> 44:33.140]  This thing will stomp you.
[44:33.760 --> 44:34.440]  Yeah, good money.
[44:35.540 --> 44:36.100]  Ooh, nice.
[44:41.580 --> 44:41.860]  Cool.
[44:42.680 --> 44:44.340]  Maybe we could buy some grenades now.
[44:44.460 --> 44:44.700]  Yeah.
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.560]  Dude, we got another 10k for that.
[44:46.800 --> 44:48.860]  Hey! Hey! Hey! We live!
[44:49.000 --> 44:49.400]  Hey, boys.
[44:50.080 --> 44:52.020]  Holy shit, Gavin, the eye!
[44:52.320 --> 44:53.360]  Wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop.
[44:53.460 --> 44:55.560]  Turn around. Turn around. Stop. Stop moving!
[44:57.660 --> 44:58.340]  You should turn around.
[44:59.180 --> 44:59.920]  Do you look at his health?
[45:01.240 --> 45:02.200]  How are you doing that?
[45:02.460 --> 45:04.600]  You grab him by the neck and you can share health.
[45:04.920 --> 45:05.880]  I... I'm down to...
[45:05.880 --> 45:05.920]  Oh!
[45:06.080 --> 45:07.100]  I'm down to 58.
[45:07.420 --> 45:10.000]  Like, I was up at 100. I'm down to like 58 now.
[45:10.680 --> 45:13.100]  I have, uh, one health.
[45:13.380 --> 45:14.120]  How many do you have, Gavin?
[45:15.320 --> 45:16.300]  20. Uh, 39.
[45:16.600 --> 45:17.180]  Okay, I'll...
[45:17.580 --> 45:18.420]  Here, hang on.
[45:18.480 --> 45:18.960]  I have 41.
[45:19.080 --> 45:20.340]  Here. I'll give...
[45:20.340 --> 45:20.940]  I can give Justin.
[45:21.160 --> 45:22.220]  I'll give you... I'll give you a little...
[45:22.820 --> 45:23.180]  Okay.
[45:23.620 --> 45:24.220]  There's 48.
[45:24.220 --> 45:26.860]  You know that when you were in the grips of the eye,
[45:27.100 --> 45:28.620]  you had the highest pitch voice in the world.
[45:28.640 --> 45:29.680]  It was. It was very funny.
[45:30.540 --> 45:32.480]  Funniest thing I've ever seen.
[45:32.560 --> 45:34.180]  Yeah, it was the funniest shit.
[45:35.260 --> 45:37.100]  Okay, we gotta get out of here.
[45:37.500 --> 45:40.300]  Yeah, so we can go to the extraction where we originally were dropped.
[45:40.540 --> 45:43.220]  Uh, oh, the other thing, that buoy noise that you were hearing
[45:43.220 --> 45:45.940]  is the sound of the second collection station.
[45:46.340 --> 45:48.500]  So, it's trying to direct you here next time.
[45:48.720 --> 45:51.140]  So there's two extraction points, but only one is an extraction point?
[45:51.200 --> 45:53.020]  Yes. One is just for money.
[45:53.880 --> 45:55.260]  Do we need the car or can we leave it?
[45:56.320 --> 45:57.400]  We could probably just leave it.
[45:58.040 --> 45:59.100]  I think we leave it, don't we?
[45:59.160 --> 46:00.260]  Yeah, let's go to hell with it.
[46:00.340 --> 46:01.720]  We left it. We left it last time.
[46:02.940 --> 46:03.500]  Oh, yeah.
[46:03.820 --> 46:05.120]  Are there still... are there still monsters?
[46:06.720 --> 46:07.440]  Uh, probably.
[46:07.820 --> 46:08.020]  I would assume so.
[46:08.340 --> 46:09.160]  I would assume so.
[46:09.780 --> 46:11.600]  I don't know. I don't even know where the eye was.
[46:11.660 --> 46:12.560]  It was like on the ceiling or something.
[46:12.700 --> 46:12.940]  Yeah.
[46:13.360 --> 46:13.560]  Yeah.
[46:13.680 --> 46:14.960]  It forces you to stare at it.
[46:16.980 --> 46:18.740]  Oh, there's like stuff on the bed we should have grabbed.
[46:18.980 --> 46:19.140]  Damn.
[46:19.360 --> 46:20.420]  Oh, yeah, a little chalice.
[46:20.620 --> 46:20.960]  A little goblet.
[46:20.960 --> 46:21.900]  Yeah, I was too bad.
[46:21.900 --> 46:24.940]  I was trying to do that as I was being murdered by a giant face.
[46:25.260 --> 46:25.620]  Oh, no!
[46:25.760 --> 46:26.960]  Oh, it's a giant face!
[46:27.020 --> 46:27.760]  That's a giant face!
[46:39.910 --> 46:43.660]  Hey, where did you guys go?
[46:43.660 --> 46:45.020]  I'm right here.
[46:45.840 --> 46:46.400]  Okay, Gavin?
[46:47.520 --> 46:49.060]  I think I have Gavin's head.
[46:49.700 --> 46:50.360]  Oh, my...
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.480]  Do you see the giant head, uh, Geoff?
[47:01.860 --> 47:02.540]  I'll take a look.
[47:03.680 --> 47:03.940]  Geoff?
[47:04.680 --> 47:05.180]  Geoff?
[47:05.860 --> 47:06.220]  Geoff?
[47:06.840 --> 47:07.680]  Oh, there's two heads.
[47:08.240 --> 47:09.360]  Oh, god.
[47:09.740 --> 47:10.080]  All right.
[47:10.280 --> 47:12.000]  I'll grab... we gotta grab them, right?
[47:12.440 --> 47:14.160]  Yeah, I'll grab, uh, the one on the right.
[47:14.580 --> 47:14.820]  Okay.
[47:16.520 --> 47:17.200]  I think it's Gavin.
[47:18.060 --> 47:18.300]  Yeah.
[47:19.980 --> 47:21.200]  Can I look at the map at the same time?
[47:21.540 --> 47:22.160]  Oh, no, I can't.
[47:22.600 --> 47:23.580]  I think you just got a bogey.
[47:24.040 --> 47:24.840]  You just got a bogey.
[47:25.640 --> 47:26.260]  Oh, my god.
[47:26.360 --> 47:27.420]  Oh, I think it's just a straight shot.
[47:27.860 --> 47:28.600]  Okay, let's go.
[47:32.900 --> 47:33.840]  I don't know what to do!
[47:33.920 --> 47:34.620]  I don't know what to do!
[47:34.920 --> 47:35.740]  The eye passed me!
[47:36.100 --> 47:36.840]  I don't know what to do!
[47:36.980 --> 47:37.920]  Where's the... where's the door?
[47:38.160 --> 47:38.860]  Can you drag me to the door?
[47:39.000 --> 47:39.700]  Can you help me to the door?
[47:40.000 --> 47:40.280]  The door!
[47:40.680 --> 47:41.260]  Take me to the door!
[47:41.500 --> 47:42.140]  Take me to the door!
[47:42.260 --> 47:42.900]  Nick, Nick, Nick!
[47:42.900 --> 47:43.560]  Follow me, Nick!
[47:43.660 --> 47:44.160]  Follow me!
[47:45.120 --> 47:45.420]  Nick!
[47:46.620 --> 47:48.100]  Nick, get away from the eye!
[47:48.240 --> 47:48.540]  Nick!
[47:48.840 --> 47:50.200]  Nick, this way, this way!
[47:50.280 --> 47:50.960]  There you go, you made it!
[47:51.260 --> 47:51.880]  Nick, you made it!
[47:51.920 --> 47:52.960]  He's still on me!
[47:53.040 --> 47:53.740]  He's looking at me!
[47:53.980 --> 47:54.280]  Okay.
[48:01.300 --> 48:01.700]  Wow.
[48:06.520 --> 48:12.380]  Oh, my god.
[48:12.580 --> 48:13.400]  Oh, Christ!
[48:15.460 --> 48:15.780]  Woo!
[48:16.500 --> 48:18.900]  We have 26k, this is great.
[48:20.820 --> 48:22.080]  That's enough for a grenade, right?
[48:22.320 --> 48:23.960]  I think we should get the health boost, yeah?
[48:25.560 --> 48:26.320]  Yeah, I agree.
[48:26.760 --> 48:28.600]  I don't know if it refills your existing health, though.
[48:28.600 --> 48:29.420]  It doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[48:29.600 --> 48:31.480]  That's okay, we gotta start making progress.
[48:31.700 --> 48:32.540]  That's fair, that's fair.
[48:35.220 --> 48:36.460]  I can't wait to get Andrew in here.
[48:36.480 --> 48:37.040]  Oh, a gun?
[48:37.660 --> 48:37.880]  Oh.
[48:38.860 --> 48:39.180]  Pricey.
[48:39.740 --> 48:40.920]  All right, I put my health up.
[48:40.920 --> 48:42.780]  But I think it only works for one person, doesn't it?
[48:44.760 --> 48:46.260]  Yeah, I think everybody's gonna get one.
[48:47.620 --> 48:48.320]  How much is it?
[48:49.140 --> 48:49.500]  4k.
[48:49.820 --> 48:51.000]  But it's a permanent upgrade.
[48:51.960 --> 48:52.160]  Yes.
[48:52.800 --> 48:53.780]  Map the play account.
[48:54.340 --> 48:58.280]  So if we each do a $4,000 upgrade, that's, we still have $10,000 to throw around.
[48:58.300 --> 48:59.360]  Is there still a health?
[48:59.560 --> 49:00.460]  That's extra jump.
[49:00.640 --> 49:01.580]  I don't think there's any more.
[49:01.580 --> 49:03.100]  There might only be two per.
[49:03.840 --> 49:05.400]  All right, well, you guys can have them this time.
[49:06.140 --> 49:08.360]  Why don't you get a, why don't you get a stamina upgrade then, Gavin?
[49:08.360 --> 49:12.760]  Yeah, I had the, I had the stamina, I had the stamina grade, I had the stamina upgrade.
[49:12.760 --> 49:15.220]  I'm gonna upgrade last time, so I'm probably not gonna get it.
[49:16.060 --> 49:16.420]  But...
[49:16.420 --> 49:17.860]  Yeah, I have it.
[49:18.040 --> 49:19.220]  There's a sprint speed one.
[49:20.080 --> 49:21.920]  Yeah, I think sprint, I think I'm gonna get the sprint speed this time.
[49:22.060 --> 49:22.980]  So nobody takes sprint speed.
[49:23.340 --> 49:23.760]  You do that.
[49:24.040 --> 49:25.360]  We don't have to spend all of our money.
[49:25.880 --> 49:29.820]  I wonder, I wonder if this is where, hang on.
[49:30.180 --> 49:34.200]  I wonder if this is where we should end the video, and then we do another one with our next levels.
[49:35.720 --> 49:36.400]  What do you think?
[49:36.960 --> 49:37.660]  Oh, you might be right.
[49:37.960 --> 49:39.460]  Yeah, that sounds like a good idea, actually.
[49:39.640 --> 49:41.740]  Or maybe if, uh, if Andrew comes back, we'll get him.
[49:41.740 --> 49:45.420]  Dude, I want to play this game with Andrew so bad.
[49:45.820 --> 49:47.000]  It will not go well.
[49:47.220 --> 49:48.060]  Can we continue from...
[49:48.880 --> 49:50.460]  Can we keep all our stuff before we leave?
[49:50.800 --> 49:51.700]  I have a feeling, right?
[49:52.320 --> 49:55.140]  Let's purchase it and start the next section that might save him.
[49:55.140 --> 49:55.400]  Here goes.
[49:56.020 --> 49:56.920]  Everyone take a step back.
[49:57.460 --> 49:58.900]  Everyone take a step back.
[49:59.500 --> 50:00.760]  Don't, yeah, Geoff, Geoff.
[50:02.380 --> 50:05.140]  Geoff is rolling around on the fucking...
[50:05.140 --> 50:05.840]  Geoff, do that again.
[50:11.630 --> 50:13.150]  Look at his little legs.
[50:25.550 --> 50:27.850]  All right, we're gonna start the next level, guys.
[50:27.950 --> 50:29.010]  Thanks for watching this one.
[50:29.470 --> 50:30.970]  Uh, I think Repo might be a fun game.
[50:31.030 --> 50:31.810]  We might be playing a bunch.
[50:32.110 --> 50:34.110]  Uh, this is pretty good.
[50:34.210 --> 50:35.570]  We'll see if our upgrades stick.
[50:35.650 --> 50:36.710]  Have a feeling they don't.
[50:39.130 --> 50:39.910]  I think they do.
[50:40.350 --> 50:40.690]  We'll see.
[50:41.930 --> 50:42.210]  All right.
[50:42.210 --> 50:46.790]  I want to give a special shout out to someone in the community who suggested this game to us.
[50:46.870 --> 50:49.390]  And his name, uh, was Jeremy Dooley.
[50:50.510 --> 50:53.330]  Yeah, he said, he texted me, said we should play.
[50:54.670 --> 50:55.410]  Thanks, Jeremy.
[50:55.690 --> 50:56.450]  Thanks, Jeremy.
[50:56.650 --> 50:58.190]  Well, Jeremy, thank you very much.
[50:58.330 --> 50:59.810]  Uh, really appreciate it.
[50:59.990 --> 51:01.370]  What is, what is this?
[51:01.410 --> 51:01.690]  Hang on.
[51:01.730 --> 51:02.950]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:03.690 --> 51:04.730]  What is this?
[51:06.150 --> 51:07.410]  It's an energy crystal.
[51:07.510 --> 51:10.970]  I wonder if we bring stuff into here and fill it up.
[51:11.210 --> 51:11.610]  Interesting.
[51:11.610 --> 51:13.090]  Well, I guess we'll figure that out next time.
[51:13.210 --> 51:15.770]  If no one's going to get this health upgrade, I guess I will.
[51:16.890 --> 51:17.770]  Okay, cool.
[51:18.990 --> 51:19.930]  All right, guys.
[51:20.090 --> 51:21.370]  Uh, we'll see you next time.
[51:21.490 --> 51:22.230]  This has been Repo.
[51:22.390 --> 51:23.090]  We'll play it again soon.
[51:23.150 --> 51:24.110]  I definitely think so.
[51:24.250 --> 51:24.790]  So, uh.
[51:24.970 --> 51:25.250]  Bye now.
[51:25.650 --> 51:25.990]  Bye.
[51:26.350 --> 51:26.850]  Bye-bye.
