[00:01.260 --> 00:07.260]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay. I don't feel trapped. I feel, uh, full of life and happy and joyful.
[00:07.640 --> 00:08.500]  How are you guys feeling?
[00:09.280 --> 00:13.140]  Good. Are you about to play GTA 4? It looks like you're about to select GTA 4.
[00:13.500 --> 00:16.080]  We were looking into it, but no, we're not playing GTA 4.
[00:16.500 --> 00:19.340]  We have an important mission this Monday morning.
[00:20.220 --> 00:20.620]  It's not Monday.
[00:20.840 --> 00:21.280]  Oh, I think I know the mission.
[00:21.600 --> 00:22.060]  Oh, you do?
[00:22.180 --> 00:22.520]  Thursday.
[00:23.420 --> 00:24.500]  What? Do you have a mission, too?
[00:24.540 --> 00:26.200]  Gavin, what do you think the mission is, Gavin?
[00:26.480 --> 00:26.580]  What a mess.
[00:27.060 --> 00:29.860]  I think the mission is we have to save Farty.
[00:30.340 --> 00:32.320]  That's right. You read the description.
[00:32.600 --> 00:35.280]  We gotta save Farty this Thursday morning.
[00:35.340 --> 00:36.000]  Oh my god.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.300]  What is this?
[00:38.080 --> 00:39.960]  Farty's a little bird. We gotta save him.
[00:40.380 --> 00:41.640]  Hall of Fame, baby. First place.
[00:43.080 --> 00:46.720]  So, like, I thought we were killing Boo Boo.
[00:47.140 --> 00:48.920]  Okay, hang on. Hang on.
[00:49.400 --> 00:51.880]  What a mess. What a start to this whole thing.
[00:51.880 --> 00:52.580]  That was great.
[00:53.100 --> 00:53.740]  Is this a blindside?
[00:54.080 --> 00:57.000]  Is this a blindside? I thought we were killing Boo Boo on hard.
[00:58.040 --> 00:59.460]  No, that was completely irrelevant.
[00:59.460 --> 01:01.800]  I thought that was just a separate conversation.
[01:01.860 --> 01:03.400]  That was a total smokescreen.
[01:04.440 --> 01:05.860]  We gotta save Farty.
[01:09.100 --> 01:09.540]  So...
[01:09.540 --> 01:11.400]  That's Farty. We gotta save him.
[01:11.960 --> 01:14.220]  And what is he in danger from?
[01:15.160 --> 01:15.600]  Everything.
[01:16.160 --> 01:17.500]  It is a Simpsons S, yeah.
[01:18.380 --> 01:22.400]  We can do an option. What I like about this is you can be English or German.
[01:23.680 --> 01:24.720]  These are your options.
[01:25.020 --> 01:25.720]  Can we be German?
[01:26.200 --> 01:28.620]  No, I think we should do English to save Farty.
[01:28.620 --> 01:31.300]  But then I do think that maybe there's a save Farty in German.
[01:31.760 --> 01:32.980]  What's Farty in German?
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.140]  That's a good question.
[01:34.180 --> 01:34.460]  Gavin?
[01:35.100 --> 01:35.760]  No idea.
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.020]  Speaking of questions, if you're buying a Corona and a burrito with some Peso, what country are you in?
[01:40.860 --> 01:42.440]  Mexico, Russia, Scotland.
[01:42.800 --> 01:43.670]  Alright, well...
[01:44.280 --> 01:44.600]  Mexico.
[01:44.860 --> 01:47.000]  Are you sure? I don't want Farty to die.
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.500]  Eric, we were just there. Did you buy a Corona at any point?
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.120]  No, I got Dos Equis, but we're gonna try Mexico.
[01:53.900 --> 01:55.500]  I do think you can do it in Russia, though.
[01:55.500 --> 01:57.700]  We saved him. Okay.
[01:58.300 --> 02:00.100]  Farty looks so soft.
[02:00.320 --> 02:00.620]  Yeah.
[02:01.120 --> 02:04.860]  The three main ingredients to making fudge is sugar, milk, and what?
[02:05.120 --> 02:07.560]  Onion, butter, and sprinkles?
[02:07.960 --> 02:09.320]  What is this game?
[02:09.760 --> 02:10.980]  Can we 50-50 this?
[02:11.840 --> 02:12.320]  Oh, shit.
[02:12.560 --> 02:12.900]  Alright.
[02:13.940 --> 02:15.600]  Hey, honestly, lucky guess.
[02:15.940 --> 02:17.760]  Sugar, milk, and meth make sludge.
[02:18.500 --> 02:21.060]  Sugar, milk, and meth sounds like a 90s band.
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.280]  Kinda, yeah.
[02:22.280 --> 02:25.580]  Beijing is the capital of which country? Taiwan, Japan, or China?
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.360]  I'm Gavin. Go for it.
[02:27.560 --> 02:27.960]  China?
[02:28.500 --> 02:31.840]  Yeah, I'm just happy they put C, China, like it all lined up.
[02:32.420 --> 02:32.920]  Oh, yeah.
[02:33.700 --> 02:34.100]  Oh!
[02:35.880 --> 02:39.120]  I thought we were wrong, because he did a little fart. A little fart by Farty.
[02:39.600 --> 02:40.820]  The largest rock on Earth.
[02:40.900 --> 02:43.820]  Oh, it's the Round Rock, just north of us in Austin.
[02:44.760 --> 02:46.000]  I've heard about that rock.
[02:46.760 --> 02:50.240]  What is the largest rock on Earth? Is it in the Mexican desert in Australia?
[02:50.240 --> 02:53.480]  Or is it responsible for two deaths and a marriage proposal gone wrong?
[02:53.580 --> 02:54.820]  Is it that place in Australia?
[02:55.440 --> 02:56.460]  I'm gonna 50-50!
[02:56.880 --> 02:57.180]  Oh, wow.
[02:57.440 --> 02:58.540]  As rock is big.
[02:58.700 --> 02:59.160]  Which one?
[03:00.600 --> 03:02.380]  Ah, Mexican! Mexican! Mexican!
[03:03.800 --> 03:04.240]  No!
[03:04.720 --> 03:05.840]  Why'd you pick that?
[03:06.080 --> 03:09.120]  I said as rock is big, and then you picked the other two.
[03:09.160 --> 03:11.420]  I didn't hear what you guys were saying! I panicked!
[03:11.580 --> 03:12.560]  Why did you pick...
[03:12.560 --> 03:15.780]  I'm pretty sure we said is Australia, right?
[03:15.860 --> 03:18.840]  Yeah, I thought we all said Australia at the same time.
[03:18.840 --> 03:20.540]  I'm sorry the time was running out.
[03:20.980 --> 03:24.080]  You just started hitting buttons and stuff, dude. I don't know.
[03:24.380 --> 03:26.120]  Okay, well, we'll set a new record here.
[03:26.280 --> 03:26.400]  Okay.
[03:26.700 --> 03:30.260]  The cartoon bear sure does love honey. He also has a friend named Christopher Robin.
[03:30.620 --> 03:31.380]  Oh, my God!
[03:31.940 --> 03:33.100]  I love Winnie the Pooh.
[03:33.320 --> 03:34.360]  Winnie the Cockatoo.
[03:35.220 --> 03:36.440]  Winnie the Pooh.
[03:37.440 --> 03:39.340]  I can't believe we're gonna be lost at this game.
[03:39.660 --> 03:40.660]  I don't think it's designed for you to lose.
[03:40.800 --> 03:42.040]  It was Andrew, really.
[03:42.340 --> 03:42.600]  Yeah.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.760]  Oh, he ate a worm.
[03:44.040 --> 03:44.480]  He did.
[03:44.720 --> 03:47.160]  Well, we're not trying to save the worm. We're trying to save Farty.
[03:47.160 --> 03:48.940]  I think he's the early bird today.
[03:49.060 --> 03:51.220]  A movement started after the acquittal of George Zimmerman.
[03:51.880 --> 03:52.180]  What?
[03:52.500 --> 03:52.740]  What?
[03:53.980 --> 03:55.620]  What is its name?
[03:56.300 --> 03:59.360]  Well, Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.
[03:59.420 --> 04:00.340]  I know this one.
[04:00.700 --> 04:01.040]  Okay, cool.
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.940]  I mean, if it was following George Zimmerman, I think it was B, but I do think that it created C.
[04:06.180 --> 04:08.340]  What is the tone of this game?
[04:09.100 --> 04:10.420]  The tone is to save Farty.
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.200]  In the U.S. state of Florida, it is illegal for a single woman to do what on a Sunday?
[04:14.700 --> 04:16.520]  Fart in public, skydive, get drunk.
[04:17.580 --> 04:18.940]  I would think.
[04:19.140 --> 04:19.760]  Do we have any idea?
[04:20.120 --> 04:20.320]  No.
[04:20.740 --> 04:21.300]  Lifeline it?
[04:21.600 --> 04:22.300]  Yeah, lifeline it.
[04:22.700 --> 04:23.720]  What's the jester hat?
[04:23.880 --> 04:24.840]  Oh, okay, it's skydive.
[04:24.880 --> 04:25.720]  It just tells us.
[04:26.580 --> 04:29.040]  It's illegal to skydive for a single woman?
[04:29.200 --> 04:29.580]  Apparently.
[04:29.720 --> 04:29.940]  Huh.
[04:30.140 --> 04:30.760]  On Sunday?
[04:31.180 --> 04:31.900]  According to Farty.
[04:32.400 --> 04:34.360]  What is the title of the fourth Harry Potter book?
[04:35.420 --> 04:36.800]  Oh, I mean, okay.
[04:37.000 --> 04:37.440]  Oh, well.
[04:37.840 --> 04:38.600]  Hold on, it's A.
[04:38.720 --> 04:39.520]  It's A.
[04:39.640 --> 04:39.980]  Yeah.
[04:40.520 --> 04:42.720]  I want to see the Stein of Fire whiskey movie.
[04:43.220 --> 04:44.220]  I'm a chalice, a truther.
[04:45.120 --> 04:45.520]  What?
[04:45.520 --> 04:46.320]  I heard that about you.
[04:46.420 --> 04:47.160]  You're a chalice, a truther.
[04:47.440 --> 04:48.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:49.580 --> 04:53.200]  What country has the greatest number of Hindus living within its borders?
[04:54.160 --> 04:56.120]  Indonesia, India, Pakistan.
[05:00.380 --> 05:01.520]  We should add more time.
[05:01.900 --> 05:03.580]  I mean, India has like a billion people.
[05:04.060 --> 05:04.580]  So does...
[05:04.580 --> 05:04.680]  Yeah.
[05:04.820 --> 05:05.020]  Yeah.
[05:06.040 --> 05:06.980]  Just, yeah, do it.
[05:07.080 --> 05:07.640]  India, okay.
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.400]  Listen, you got your head massaged there.
[05:09.400 --> 05:12.180]  I will say Pakistan also has a billion people, doesn't it?
[05:12.180 --> 05:13.040]  Good call, Gavin.
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.000]  We reached five.
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.400]  Look at how happy Farty is.
[05:15.420 --> 05:15.880]  He's still alive.
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.800]  You don't care about Farty at all.
[05:17.900 --> 05:19.140]  You don't love Farty?
[05:19.480 --> 05:19.540]  No.
[05:19.660 --> 05:21.680]  Does anyone feel like they didn't fully wake up today?
[05:22.140 --> 05:22.320]  Yes.
[05:22.740 --> 05:25.800]  Which river in India is sacred to the followers of Hinduism?
[05:26.560 --> 05:28.200]  The Mississippi, the Nile, the Ganges.
[05:28.260 --> 05:29.260]  Gavin, this could be one of your dreams.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.420]  I think it's probably the Ganges.
[05:31.160 --> 05:31.440]  Yeah.
[05:31.700 --> 05:34.340]  I think it could be the Mississippi, but I'll go with you guys.
[05:34.980 --> 05:35.780]  Okay, okay.
[05:36.820 --> 05:38.880]  I feel, you know, the audience doesn't know this.
[05:38.980 --> 05:41.800]  Five minutes ago, we were almost playing GTA 4.
[05:41.920 --> 05:43.180]  And that feels so far away now.
[05:43.180 --> 05:43.580]  Yeah.
[05:44.640 --> 05:47.920]  What movie introduced the song, Someday My Prince Will Come?
[05:48.400 --> 05:51.220]  The Little Mermaid, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, The Lion King.
[05:51.560 --> 05:51.940]  No idea.
[05:51.940 --> 05:52.340]  It has to be B.
[05:52.600 --> 05:53.500]  It's B, it's Snow White.
[05:53.820 --> 05:54.500]  It's B, yeah.
[05:55.900 --> 05:57.580]  Are you going to watch the new one?
[05:58.320 --> 05:58.580]  No.
[05:58.780 --> 05:59.460]  There's a new one?
[05:59.480 --> 06:02.460]  Why would I watch any of the new ones?
[06:02.720 --> 06:03.540]  It's so weird.
[06:03.720 --> 06:05.280]  All the live action remakes suck.
[06:05.280 --> 06:06.480]  Ooh, Gavin, you got this.
[06:07.080 --> 06:10.500]  The name of what Peruvian capital is also the name of a bean?
[06:11.740 --> 06:12.620]  Lima, Pinto...
[06:13.540 --> 06:16.780]  Those are also the three ships that they sailed to discover America.
[06:17.120 --> 06:17.860]  That's right.
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.280]  No, no, don't do it.
[06:19.360 --> 06:21.060]  No, why would you use that?
[06:21.280 --> 06:22.900]  It's just A, P, A, N.
[06:23.480 --> 06:24.180]  Okay, Jesus.
[06:24.400 --> 06:25.920]  Why would you use that?
[06:26.280 --> 06:26.800]  It's Lima.
[06:26.800 --> 06:27.700]  It's Lima.
[06:28.700 --> 06:29.520]  Fuck it in.
[06:30.260 --> 06:35.440]  Who became the first amputee ever to compete at the Olympics when he ran in an open-quarter meter run on August 2nd?
[06:35.920 --> 06:39.760]  Dude, Oscar Historius is fucking funny.
[06:39.940 --> 06:41.440]  That is very funny.
[06:42.740 --> 06:44.060]  Andrew, who do you think it is?
[06:44.220 --> 06:45.340]  Oscar Historius.
[06:45.440 --> 06:45.860]  Okay, good.
[06:46.020 --> 06:48.100]  And this was before he blew away his wife?
[06:48.220 --> 06:48.460]  Yes.
[06:49.120 --> 06:50.020]  No, no, it was after.
[06:50.680 --> 06:51.020]  Oh, okay.
[06:51.280 --> 06:52.680]  Yeah, no, it was after. Don't worry.
[06:53.380 --> 06:56.380]  I believe he was on the run while it was occurring.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.260]  Which Michael Crichton book was made into a movie about a dinosaur?
[07:01.920 --> 07:06.500]  Now, I will say, timeline underrated book.
[07:06.820 --> 07:09.540]  Not a great movie, but good for you.
[07:09.540 --> 07:09.980]  Achievement!
[07:09.980 --> 07:11.680]  Look at all these achievements, son.
[07:11.940 --> 07:12.920]  He's loving it.
[07:13.160 --> 07:13.880]  He's dancing away.
[07:13.880 --> 07:15.680]  We've already used all of our lifelines.
[07:15.860 --> 07:17.180]  Andrew just started hitting lifelines.
[07:18.120 --> 07:21.740]  Who married Abraham and bore his son Isaac?
[07:22.240 --> 07:22.760]  Sarah.
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.060]  It's Hagar the Horrible.
[07:29.560 --> 07:31.300]  Sarah Todd, right? Was that her name?
[07:32.340 --> 07:32.700]  What?
[07:33.400 --> 07:34.180]  Sarah Todd?
[07:34.600 --> 07:35.960]  She had a last name?
[07:37.200 --> 07:38.660]  They were pretty original back then.
[07:40.580 --> 07:41.920]  Are we talking Lincoln?
[07:42.380 --> 07:44.400]  In electronics, what does DC stand for?
[07:45.600 --> 07:46.320]  Direct current.
[07:46.720 --> 07:47.520]  No, don't pick that.
[07:47.540 --> 07:50.180]  I'm sorry, did you think the last question was about Abraham Lincoln?
[07:50.680 --> 07:52.120]  No, don't pick direct current!
[07:54.440 --> 07:55.900]  Why wouldn't I pick direct current?
[07:56.020 --> 07:56.240]  I'm just kidding.
[07:57.460 --> 07:58.780]  It's Tons of Carrots.
[08:00.400 --> 08:02.740]  Which Beatles song has been covered by more artists than any other?
[08:02.740 --> 08:03.420]  Didn't we just talk about this?
[08:04.380 --> 08:04.720]  I don't know.
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.740]  I actually don't know this.
[08:05.860 --> 08:06.200]  I don't know this.
[08:08.480 --> 08:09.240]  I agree.
[08:09.240 --> 08:09.940]  I think it's Yesterday.
[08:10.180 --> 08:11.280]  It's a bigger song.
[08:12.140 --> 08:12.300]  Yeah.
[08:12.300 --> 08:14.580]  Didn't we talk about the most covered song ever?
[08:16.160 --> 08:17.680]  You and I were talking about it.
[08:17.960 --> 08:19.220]  I don't know if we're going to bother debating.
[08:19.920 --> 08:20.820]  I got to pick, I got to pick, I got to pick!
[08:21.100 --> 08:23.280]  Yeah, I know, because we told you to pick it.
[08:23.400 --> 08:27.080]  We said Yesterday, you just sat there for eight seconds.
[08:27.780 --> 08:29.580]  Well, it didn't seem like there was a consensus.
[08:29.800 --> 08:31.140]  It seemed like it was still being worked out.
[08:33.640 --> 08:34.860]  There was a discussion happening.
[08:34.860 --> 08:40.320]  Which is more computing power, the Sony PlayStation or the NASA computer that sent Neil Armstrong to the moon?
[08:40.700 --> 08:41.160]  The PlayStation?
[08:41.400 --> 08:42.240]  Both are equal?
[08:42.320 --> 08:43.300]  The NASA computer?
[08:44.080 --> 08:44.700]  The PlayStation.
[08:45.120 --> 08:47.920]  I think both are equal is a very funny answer.
[08:48.040 --> 08:51.020]  We need to make it the exact same number of components.
[08:52.640 --> 08:53.620]  The PlayStation?
[08:55.840 --> 08:57.760]  Holy shit, that's 14!
[08:57.760 --> 09:00.300]  Why could one send you to the moon?
[09:01.060 --> 09:01.580]  Whoa!
[09:02.360 --> 09:05.580]  In the famous Hansel and Gretel story, who lives in a gingerbread house?
[09:05.700 --> 09:08.780]  A shaven gorilla, a snowman made from dog poop, a witch...
[09:08.780 --> 09:10.220]  What is this game?
[09:10.500 --> 09:12.600]  It's called Farty, the trivia game.
[09:12.760 --> 09:13.780]  I hate Farty.
[09:14.280 --> 09:15.240]  Yeah, he should die.
[09:15.380 --> 09:17.100]  Did you develop this game, Andrew?
[09:17.580 --> 09:19.020]  Are we going to find that out?
[09:19.180 --> 09:20.680]  Look at all these stars!
[09:21.320 --> 09:22.460]  Did you get a writing credit?
[09:23.000 --> 09:23.420]  I wish.
[09:24.120 --> 09:26.500]  Which star in the Matrix played John Wick?
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.640]  Just do it, let's move on.
[09:29.640 --> 09:32.420]  We don't have time to riff on this one.
[09:32.680 --> 09:35.560]  We move on to the funny ones.
[09:35.940 --> 09:39.280]  What world leader's name literally means Feradian East in Mandarin?
[09:39.720 --> 09:44.640]  Mao Zedong, Indira Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Indira...
[09:47.440 --> 09:47.960]  What?
[09:49.520 --> 09:50.820]  I was just correcting how he said it.
[09:50.840 --> 09:52.400]  I don't know, Mao? I have no idea.
[09:52.680 --> 09:53.500]  I would think so.
[09:53.920 --> 09:56.560]  If only we had all of our fucking specials back.
[09:57.000 --> 09:57.160]  Farty!
[09:57.620 --> 09:58.140]  Farty!
[09:59.140 --> 10:00.620]  We've already made it.
[10:01.580 --> 10:05.020]  Andrew is like rushing to the next question. It's like insane.
[10:05.560 --> 10:09.200]  It's 1916, you're in a movie theater watching the latest film from the Master of Suspense.
[10:09.280 --> 10:10.060]  Who would that be?
[10:10.540 --> 10:12.460]  Alfred Hitchcock, Edward Orson Welles.
[10:12.660 --> 10:13.540]  It's Alfred Hitchcock.
[10:13.560 --> 10:15.060]  Has to be Hitchcock, right?
[10:15.280 --> 10:17.100]  Oh my god, you couldn't have been Edward then.
[10:17.840 --> 10:18.940]  I was just scrolling through.
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.620]  Can you stop for a second? Like, don't go to next yet.
[10:24.360 --> 10:25.240]  Slow down.
[10:26.100 --> 10:29.140]  Have a streak of 10 correct answers without you, Joker.
[10:29.520 --> 10:33.640]  This is like a 6 minute video right now. Relax.
[10:34.400 --> 10:35.060]  What's going on?
[10:35.060 --> 10:37.460]  Did you have a monster energy drink this morning, Andrew?
[10:37.980 --> 10:40.100]  No, we're just getting through. We're trying to save Farty.
[10:40.100 --> 10:43.060]  Did this white monster have his white monster to get this day started?
[10:43.460 --> 10:45.600]  What's going on? I feel like...
[10:45.600 --> 10:46.680]  I'm trying to save Farty.
[10:46.680 --> 10:47.760]  I feel insane.
[10:47.760 --> 10:49.320]  Part of this is confusing.
[10:49.540 --> 10:53.440]  I feel so crazy right now. I'm having a cup of coffee and it's not...
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.340]  How would you refer to a group of crows? That's a murder.
[10:56.560 --> 10:57.460]  Yeah, that's a murder.
[10:58.040 --> 11:00.360]  I just text my wife to make another pot of coffee.
[11:01.640 --> 11:04.480]  Gavin, this is like breakneck speed, right? Like, this is crazy.
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.340]  Vladivostok gave Russia its own ice report on what body of water...
[11:09.340 --> 11:09.420]  It's happening!
[11:10.780 --> 11:12.120]  The Black Sea, I know that.
[11:12.180 --> 11:14.120]  What is going on?
[11:14.120 --> 11:14.460]  No!
[11:15.540 --> 11:16.780]  What do you mean you know that?
[11:17.140 --> 11:18.520]  I'm sorry, Andrew.
[11:19.140 --> 11:20.320]  Well, I know that.
[11:20.320 --> 11:21.540]  I know that!
[11:21.540 --> 11:23.920]  It's absolutely the secret record!
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.540]  Why would...
[11:26.540 --> 11:29.180]  Don't try again! Stop! Hang on!
[11:29.400 --> 11:31.260]  Let's look at the achievements for a second.
[11:32.040 --> 11:34.660]  100 questions right, 50-50, 10 times.
[11:34.840 --> 11:35.940]  Hit 10, 10, 10.
[11:35.940 --> 11:37.940]  What level do we save Farty at?
[11:38.400 --> 11:39.580]  Uh, 30 it appears.
[11:40.140 --> 11:41.380]  Oh, 50 maybe?
[11:41.580 --> 11:43.680]  Okay, so Andrew's just...
[11:43.680 --> 11:45.840]  This is the worst.
[11:47.860 --> 11:51.920]  Okay, so let's get 100 right, but don't blow our lifelines on easy questions.
[11:52.540 --> 11:52.560]  Right.
[11:53.340 --> 11:56.300]  This isn't a blindside, but it's a hold captive.
[11:57.020 --> 11:59.040]  That was right? Oh man, that was a guess.
[11:59.380 --> 12:00.800]  I feel crazy.
[12:01.080 --> 12:02.400]  Okay, 99 more to go.
[12:02.800 --> 12:04.760]  I just text her to ask her to make it faster.
[12:05.080 --> 12:06.760]  The deepest place on Earth is...
[12:06.760 --> 12:07.220]  This.
[12:08.180 --> 12:08.620]  B.
[12:09.080 --> 12:11.720]  At the bottom of this...
[12:11.720 --> 12:13.040]  The Marianas Trench, right? Yeah.
[12:14.840 --> 12:17.100]  This game, I hate Farty.
[12:17.280 --> 12:17.900]  98 more to go.
[12:17.940 --> 12:19.300]  I hate him so much.
[12:19.400 --> 12:21.040]  Where might you find a submarine volcano?
[12:23.160 --> 12:23.720]  What?
[12:24.240 --> 12:24.620]  The floor, right?
[12:25.060 --> 12:26.420]  Yeah, what? Huh?
[12:27.140 --> 12:28.800]  Oh, I was very...
[12:28.800 --> 12:29.260]  The moon?
[12:30.080 --> 12:30.380]  What?
[12:30.800 --> 12:32.380]  There's no ocean on the moon?
[12:33.140 --> 12:33.380]  Yeah.
[12:34.580 --> 12:43.800]  A word such as madame that can be spelled the same forward as backwards is an example of an onomatopoeia, an acronym, a palindrome.
[12:43.940 --> 12:44.860]  What do you think it is, Andrew?
[12:45.220 --> 12:45.620]  Oh.
[12:51.320 --> 12:52.300]  Great job, Gavin.
[12:53.660 --> 12:56.860]  I thought Andrew was blowing through it until we get to like level 30.
[12:56.900 --> 12:58.060]  That's what I was...
[12:58.060 --> 12:59.760]  96 more to go.
[13:00.280 --> 13:03.660]  Which of these animals lay eggs to give birth to their young...
[13:03.660 --> 13:04.280]  Hey.
[13:05.820 --> 13:06.300]  Chicken.
[13:06.620 --> 13:07.760]  This is the weirdest...
[13:08.320 --> 13:08.620]  On the board.
[13:08.960 --> 13:09.880]  What is...
[13:09.880 --> 13:11.020]  Saving Farty.
[13:11.500 --> 13:12.240]  Doing a little dance.
[13:12.900 --> 13:15.720]  You're one of Santa's reindeer, and to your astonishment, your nose glows.
[13:16.040 --> 13:16.700]  Who are you?
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.500]  You are Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
[13:18.680 --> 13:20.780]  Brad, the coolest reindeer of all.
[13:21.100 --> 13:22.220]  Hey, Eric, real quick.
[13:22.220 --> 13:22.360]  Yeah?
[13:23.680 --> 13:26.680]  Is anybody aware, did we kill Bob Uecker or did he just...
[13:27.220 --> 13:29.600]  No, that's totally separate from anything we did.
[13:30.040 --> 13:30.840]  Okay, top one.
[13:30.840 --> 13:32.520]  Tips and leads from informants.
[13:32.720 --> 13:35.640]  We haven't mentioned him in a while, Geoff.
[13:35.820 --> 13:37.340]  I'll take the location on this one.
[13:37.480 --> 13:39.080]  What do bats use to locate their prey?
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.740]  Tips and leads from their informants is the funniest thing I've read all day.
[13:43.060 --> 13:47.940]  What is the name of Amazon's home assistant that's Alexa, not Zelda or Maisy?
[13:49.880 --> 13:51.180]  Maisy sounds like a little mouse.
[13:51.800 --> 13:52.080]  It does.
[13:52.420 --> 13:53.080]  Dude, Zelda? That'd be cool.
[13:53.780 --> 13:55.940]  Prague is the capital of which country?
[13:55.960 --> 13:56.500]  What is it, Andrew?
[13:56.800 --> 13:57.600]  What is it, Andrew?
[13:57.600 --> 13:58.440]  Czech Republic.
[13:58.920 --> 13:59.460]  All right.
[13:59.460 --> 14:01.260]  He knows his chalk.
[14:01.820 --> 14:02.980]  I know we're playing.
[14:03.480 --> 14:05.900]  It's because he saw Mission Impossible 1.
[14:06.380 --> 14:07.280]  That's true.
[14:08.200 --> 14:10.900]  And which of these countries is the capital, also the largest city?
[14:14.060 --> 14:14.540]  Gavin?
[14:17.080 --> 14:17.860]  It's England.
[14:21.380 --> 14:22.560]  Yeah, he's probably right.
[14:22.800 --> 14:25.540]  But the city of London is where the capital is and it's tiny, right?
[14:25.580 --> 14:27.140]  Isn't it only like two miles by two miles?
[14:28.020 --> 14:29.600]  Yeah, but I think it just means London.
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.620]  Barely snuck that in at ten.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.040]  Ninety more to go.
[14:36.320 --> 14:38.260]  What is his initial stood for?
[14:38.660 --> 14:40.300]  What reclusive author said it was?
[14:40.820 --> 14:41.660]  Juvenile delinquent.
[14:42.700 --> 14:42.980]  Hey, Geoff.
[14:45.780 --> 14:48.020]  I've never heard of J.D. Harris or J.D. Harper.
[14:48.220 --> 14:49.220]  I only know J.D. Salinger.
[14:49.400 --> 14:51.220]  I feel like that's a Salinger.
[14:53.140 --> 14:54.260]  Nice job, Geoff.
[14:54.480 --> 14:55.040]  In the clutch.
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.480]  He was able to write from the young person's mind very well.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.440]  What do you call a young cow? A poliwog? A heifer? A kid?
[15:05.300 --> 15:06.920]  I feel like it's heifer, right?
[15:07.240 --> 15:08.620]  Yeah, oh, did you not know?
[15:08.940 --> 15:11.080]  I thought you were blowing through some of these.
[15:11.140 --> 15:14.560]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I felt 90% sure, but kid really threw me.
[15:14.600 --> 15:15.320]  I feel like I've seen kid.
[15:15.320 --> 15:15.860]  I'd say goat, I think.
[15:16.060 --> 15:16.900]  Well, yeah, kid's a goat.
[15:17.420 --> 15:18.440]  That's what I'm saying.
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.800]  What term describes a British queen known for persecuting protestants in a cocktail made with vodka and tomato juice?
[15:23.800 --> 15:24.620]  Protestants.
[15:24.660 --> 15:26.460]  Virgin Queen Bloody Mary, the hammer.
[15:27.020 --> 15:28.920]  You're the only one authorized to answer this.
[15:29.100 --> 15:29.540]  Yeah, it's true.
[15:31.040 --> 15:31.640]  I'm waiting.
[15:32.500 --> 15:33.100]  Bloody Mary?
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.180]  Oh, there you are, we're locking it in.
[15:35.620 --> 15:36.920]  She bathed in the blood of her enemies.
[15:37.400 --> 15:38.520]  Farty stays alive.
[15:39.180 --> 15:39.340]  Allegedly.
[15:39.820 --> 15:40.830]  Those damn protestants.
[15:41.680 --> 15:43.660]  That'd be awesome if they used to call her the hammer.
[15:44.760 --> 15:48.800]  What do you call any material that can be magnetized? Metallic, ferromagnetic, isomorphic?
[15:50.320 --> 15:51.280]  That says Metallica.
[15:54.800 --> 15:55.640]  Sure does.
[15:55.800 --> 15:56.500]  You said metallic.
[15:56.740 --> 15:58.060]  Which one do we want to pick?
[15:58.080 --> 15:59.420]  It has to be ferromagnetic, right?
[16:00.200 --> 16:00.440]  Yeah.
[16:01.360 --> 16:04.640]  I expected the science guy would chime in, but dead silent over there.
[16:04.740 --> 16:06.400]  Yeah, he's doing something else.
[16:06.660 --> 16:11.480]  Which of these is not a soup? Gazpacho, pita, porridge?
[16:12.220 --> 16:13.320]  Oh, what do you think?
[16:13.860 --> 16:14.720]  Andrew, pita.
[16:14.720 --> 16:15.340]  You know what this is.
[16:15.340 --> 16:16.920]  Yeah, I got it.
[16:20.200 --> 16:21.340]  It's pita, it's pita.
[16:21.880 --> 16:22.360]  Fifteen.
[16:22.980 --> 16:27.200]  The TGV connects Paris and Leon, which is... what is it?
[16:33.240 --> 16:34.580]  What is it?
[16:36.840 --> 16:38.240]  The trainer canal.
[16:38.780 --> 16:39.580]  Which one is it?
[16:40.600 --> 16:41.920]  Guys, Farty's on the line!
[16:42.260 --> 16:43.940]  I was gonna say a train, I don't know.
[16:45.340 --> 16:47.400]  I've been thinking train, yeah.
[16:47.480 --> 16:49.200]  You ate the one!
[16:49.560 --> 16:50.760]  You ate the one!
[16:51.480 --> 16:52.040]  Farty!
[16:52.880 --> 16:53.840]  What would it be?
[16:54.180 --> 16:54.940]  What would it be?
[16:55.320 --> 16:57.080]  We're never gonna get to level 100.
[16:59.640 --> 17:02.100]  He said this would take 30 minutes, by the way.
[17:02.300 --> 17:05.960]  The way you said, the way you said, what is it?
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.880]  Oh, it killed me, dude.
[17:07.880 --> 17:09.080]  No, don't do that.
[17:09.920 --> 17:10.480]  Farty!
[17:11.300 --> 17:11.980]  Still start!
[17:12.200 --> 17:13.580]  Alright, go for it.
[17:13.580 --> 17:16.300]  We met Monday, what the...
[17:20.140 --> 17:21.060]  Saloon!
[17:21.460 --> 17:22.040]  Saloon!
[17:22.600 --> 17:23.020]  Saloon!
[17:23.060 --> 17:23.540]  Saloon!
[17:26.360 --> 17:27.080]  Fucking idiots.
[17:28.340 --> 17:28.800]  Dummies.
