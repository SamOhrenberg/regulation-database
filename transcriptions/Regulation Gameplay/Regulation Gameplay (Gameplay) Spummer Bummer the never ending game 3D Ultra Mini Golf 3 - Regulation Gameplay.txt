[00:03.060 --> 00:04.540]  Hey, just switching to copy.
[00:04.540 --> 00:06.680]  Oh shit, I fucking, I need an invite.
[00:07.100 --> 00:08.720]  Geoff, shoot me in the belly.
[00:12.260 --> 00:13.060]  I panicked.
[00:13.520 --> 00:14.580]  Oh god.
[00:15.180 --> 00:16.620]  Why did you, why?
[00:17.220 --> 00:20.160]  Because I didn't want to be the character I was because Geoff said,
[00:20.360 --> 00:22.740]  let's ready up, and I was like, ah, I haven't done any of this yet.
[00:23.140 --> 00:24.480]  And then I just picked a character
[00:25.160 --> 00:26.780]  and it happened to be Geoff's.
[00:27.080 --> 00:28.480]  There's only like four characters.
[00:28.820 --> 00:30.500]  Yeah, be the one that no one else is.
[00:31.200 --> 00:32.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:33.020 --> 00:34.820]  Well then I could have just hit A.
[00:35.640 --> 00:36.100]  Well yeah!
[00:37.080 --> 00:39.000]  Yeah, I think that's why we all yelled at you.
[00:39.240 --> 00:40.040]  We're waiting for Nick.
[00:42.400 --> 00:44.360]  Alright, here we are. 3D Ultra
[00:44.360 --> 00:46.800]  Mini Golf Part 3. I'm estimating
[00:46.800 --> 00:48.580]  it'll be a six part series if
[00:48.580 --> 00:50.420]  people want us to keep playing it
[00:50.420 --> 00:53.400]  and we don't want to double up on maps.
[00:53.580 --> 00:54.620]  I want to publicly
[00:54.620 --> 00:56.480]  call out Spummer for adding
[00:56.480 --> 00:58.900]  20 minutes to the technical difficulties of this level.
[00:59.920 --> 01:01.120]  That was a
[01:02.540 --> 01:03.260]  Spummer bummer.
[01:03.380 --> 01:05.020]  There's a bug where you can't sign on
[01:05.020 --> 01:06.920]  to a 360 Xbox Live if you have
[01:06.920 --> 01:08.740]  too many friends. And I was like,
[01:08.880 --> 01:11.160]  I haven't added anyone in like 10 years.
[01:11.280 --> 01:12.520]  Wow, Geoff!
[01:12.520 --> 01:14.760]  Boy was I wrong. Geoff, way to go. Hole in one.
[01:15.160 --> 01:16.040]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:16.120 --> 01:19.400]  The streak continues. How do you...
[01:19.400 --> 01:19.880]  Golf.
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.800]  A, hold A,
[01:22.980 --> 01:23.780]  and then release.
[01:24.520 --> 01:27.000]  Ah, shit. Way to go, Gavin.
[01:27.000 --> 01:28.880]  Well, you guys will have Gavin's ball.
[01:29.180 --> 01:30.080]  He just said A.
[01:30.500 --> 01:32.660]  Oh, you twat! I forgot!
[01:33.680 --> 01:34.000]  Shit!
[01:34.820 --> 01:35.520]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:37.040 --> 01:37.400]  It's in the hole.
[01:40.820 --> 01:42.000]  Why would I...
[01:42.420 --> 01:44.720]  Welcome to mini-golf, Nick. Hey, thanks, man.
[01:45.740 --> 01:46.740]  Why am I moving?
[01:47.340 --> 01:48.940]  Did you not see my ball sat there, Nick?
[01:49.280 --> 01:49.500]  Nope.
[01:51.520 --> 01:53.040]  I thought it was insane that
[01:53.040 --> 01:55.160]  Nick was asking how to play when it wasn't his turn.
[01:55.160 --> 01:57.100]  Yeah, why were you going left
[01:57.100 --> 01:58.640]  and right off the rip, dude?
[01:59.640 --> 01:59.840]  Who, me?
[02:00.340 --> 02:02.300]  No, Andrew, you just started like...
[02:02.300 --> 02:03.740]  Yeah, no, I fucked it up so bad.
[02:04.140 --> 02:06.600]  It's like locked into dead center.
[02:07.340 --> 02:09.240]  No, you guys start pointed at the hole,
[02:09.340 --> 02:09.660]  I don't think.
[02:12.460 --> 02:13.160]  You don't think
[02:13.160 --> 02:14.600]  you start pointed at the hole?
[02:15.240 --> 02:16.740]  I don't think I start pointed at the hole.
[02:16.940 --> 02:18.960]  You're pointed at the hole right now!
[02:19.340 --> 02:21.460]  This isn't the start, you silly plum!
[02:24.340 --> 02:25.140]  This is...
[02:25.140 --> 02:26.180]  The hole is dead ahead.
[02:26.540 --> 02:28.040]  What is happening?
[02:28.200 --> 02:29.940]  Let's not start throwing fruit into insults.
[02:29.940 --> 02:32.880]  Sorry, I didn't mean to fruitball so early.
[02:33.200 --> 02:35.160]  I wasn't aiming at the hole on that one.
[02:36.060 --> 02:36.860]  Yeah, no shit.
[02:37.520 --> 02:39.740]  You're dead ahead at the beginning of this.
[02:42.680 --> 02:43.160]  Oh!
[02:44.780 --> 02:46.580]  A little bit too much
[02:47.080 --> 02:48.480]  bean on the toast.
[02:48.740 --> 02:50.360]  Man, all the good power-ups are past the hole.
[02:50.580 --> 02:51.040]  Go, go, go!
[02:51.740 --> 02:52.160]  Nice.
[02:53.460 --> 02:55.340]  How do you use a power-up when you get it?
[02:55.500 --> 02:56.560]  Very graceful, Andrew.
[02:57.400 --> 02:57.680]  Thank you.
[02:58.140 --> 02:58.680]  Was it B?
[02:59.540 --> 03:00.160]  I believe so.
[03:04.280 --> 03:05.260]  It's my first day.
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.040]  After one hole...
[03:11.300 --> 03:12.140]  Whoever wins...
[03:12.700 --> 03:14.080]  They get replaced, right?
[03:14.380 --> 03:15.060]  Is that how it goes?
[03:17.080 --> 03:19.040]  Yeah, whoever wins...
[03:19.840 --> 03:21.280]  I'll jump in the next game.
[03:22.020 --> 03:23.760]  Oh, I'm put in the hole, right?
[03:24.360 --> 03:25.920]  I don't need to move because I'm put in the hole.
[03:26.080 --> 03:27.420]  You were dead ahead
[03:27.420 --> 03:29.600]  at the very beginning of the first thing.
[03:30.800 --> 03:31.620]  This is simple.
[03:31.840 --> 03:32.960]  Just get a Tetris.
[03:33.340 --> 03:34.600]  Can I get instant replay
[03:34.600 --> 03:37.240]  of the first time I could see the hole
[03:37.240 --> 03:38.500]  from my character's point of view
[03:38.500 --> 03:41.600]  and see if Eric was right as he always is?
[03:41.820 --> 03:41.980]  Okay.
[03:45.860 --> 03:47.700]  It'd be so funny if that was a hole-in-one.
[03:47.700 --> 03:48.300]  Whoa!
[03:48.740 --> 03:49.940]  Oh, there's fans!
[03:51.240 --> 03:53.280]  Oh, this is crazy.
[03:54.060 --> 03:54.740]  Oh, which hole?
[03:55.660 --> 03:56.400]  Not a choice.
[03:57.200 --> 03:58.560]  Which one will it aim you at first?
[03:59.300 --> 04:00.700]  Gavin's ultimate enemy.
[04:01.500 --> 04:02.700]  Did you just give it full beans?
[04:03.620 --> 04:05.320]  Oh, did you give it just about full beans?
[04:05.880 --> 04:06.980]  And it did not work.
[04:07.740 --> 04:08.260]  Where's the fan?
[04:08.940 --> 04:10.360]  Oh, no!
[04:11.420 --> 04:12.680]  Wait, stop.
[04:12.960 --> 04:14.540]  Oh, the fan isn't always on.
[04:15.320 --> 04:15.780]  Oh.
[04:16.900 --> 04:18.860]  Now you moved, Andrew. You blew it.
[04:19.200 --> 04:21.140]  I'm adjusting to his liquid full beans
[04:21.140 --> 04:22.280]  and it didn't work, apparently.
[04:22.540 --> 04:23.580]  You gotta do lesser beans.
[04:24.360 --> 04:26.060]  No, I think it was the timing of the fan.
[04:26.320 --> 04:28.320]  Oh, my God!
[04:28.840 --> 04:30.300]  Oh, my God!
[04:30.340 --> 04:30.580]  No!
[04:31.560 --> 04:33.080]  Go! Go! Go!
[04:33.580 --> 04:34.380]  Where's the cum?
[04:35.920 --> 04:37.240]  Oh, Nick got the specimen.
[04:38.060 --> 04:39.300]  God damn it, Nick!
[04:39.340 --> 04:40.440]  Nick, did you get the specimen?
[04:41.260 --> 04:42.100]  What's the specimen?
[04:42.440 --> 04:43.180]  You got the cum.
[04:45.160 --> 04:46.860]  Can you use the cum
[04:46.860 --> 04:48.320]  when it's not your turn?
[04:48.520 --> 04:49.820]  No, I think you have to wait for Nick.
[04:50.220 --> 04:52.720]  No, we're stuck here looking at Andrew's ball.
[04:52.780 --> 04:52.800]  I'm waiting for Nick.
[04:53.120 --> 04:54.920]  I think his ball is still moving.
[04:56.200 --> 04:58.140]  We couldn't even see where it wound up.
[04:58.720 --> 05:00.560]  Oh, God. How many beans?
[05:00.840 --> 05:01.340]  All of them.
[05:02.320 --> 05:03.960]  A low amount of beans, but it could be
[05:03.960 --> 05:06.120]  the right amount of beans for the fan. It is...
[05:06.780 --> 05:08.080]  Oh, what a jump!
[05:08.080 --> 05:09.840]  What the fuck?
[05:12.440 --> 05:13.320]  All right.
[05:14.760 --> 05:16.200]  It's pointed right at the hole
[05:16.200 --> 05:16.780]  right there.
[05:17.220 --> 05:19.100]  What am I doing?
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.240]  There's a button to view
[05:22.240 --> 05:22.800]  the hole, right?
[05:24.120 --> 05:25.360]  I think it's A.
[05:26.260 --> 05:28.000]  I mean, there's only so many buttons. You could probably
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.240]  figure it out. I don't want to accidentally just tap
[05:30.240 --> 05:31.040]  the bowler.
[05:32.560 --> 05:33.000]  B.
[05:33.960 --> 05:35.520]  Left bumper. Right bumper.
[05:35.520 --> 05:37.460]  Right trigger. Oh, shit!
[05:37.980 --> 05:39.700]  Left trigger. Oh, shit. Sweet.
[05:40.160 --> 05:41.280]  How do I get back to...
[05:41.280 --> 05:42.740]  How do I get back down to Earth?
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.980]  Oh, right trigger.
[05:46.160 --> 05:47.020]  Okay, here we go.
[05:49.460 --> 05:53.590]  Get in there. Get in there, son.
[05:53.930 --> 05:55.470]  That's weird. You were pointed right at that hole.
[05:56.990 --> 05:57.710]  That's wild!
[05:58.410 --> 05:58.670]  Holy fuck.
[05:59.470 --> 06:04.150]  Wow, that worked out really well.
[06:04.250 --> 06:04.790]  Oh, Nick!
[06:06.250 --> 06:07.050]  Holy shit.
[06:07.050 --> 06:08.710]  Nick, when you go, you're gonna hit it.
[06:09.090 --> 06:11.070]  Yes! Yes! The specimen!
[06:11.530 --> 06:12.570]  Oh, the cone!
[06:13.430 --> 06:15.290]  Dude, did the ground drink it all up?
[06:15.950 --> 06:17.290]  So, Nick, that means that you
[06:18.170 --> 06:18.570]  went...
[06:18.570 --> 06:21.010]  You somehow ended up in the middle hole from
[06:21.010 --> 06:22.530]  Andrew's bowl. Yep, I did.
[06:24.130 --> 06:24.950]  Andrew's going backwards.
[06:25.750 --> 06:26.310]  Oh, no!
[06:26.770 --> 06:27.670]  Oh, no!
[06:29.350 --> 06:29.750]  Wily!
[06:31.110 --> 06:33.230]  No, actually, you always pointed at the hole.
[06:33.330 --> 06:33.890]  That was the right way.
[06:33.890 --> 06:34.870]  You pointed right at the hole.
[06:35.030 --> 06:36.230]  Oh, no!
[06:41.690 --> 06:44.470]  I felt real good about that shot, too.
[06:45.710 --> 06:47.770]  That was... Oh, man.
[06:47.950 --> 06:49.710]  Absolutely incredible. See, there's the hole.
[06:49.990 --> 06:50.990]  Pointed right at it. Easy.
[06:51.930 --> 06:52.550]  Fan! Fan!
[06:53.950 --> 06:54.730]  Come on!
[06:57.890 --> 06:59.050]  Get in the hole!
[06:59.650 --> 07:01.710]  Oh, he's done it. Get in the hole!
[07:01.710 --> 07:02.690]  Yeah!
[07:03.950 --> 07:05.850]  How did you get a birdie?
[07:06.090 --> 07:08.070]  Dude, how the fuck did you get a birdie
[07:08.070 --> 07:08.930]  out of all of that?
[07:11.490 --> 07:13.590]  I can't believe...
[07:13.590 --> 07:14.290]  You got this, Geoff.
[07:16.250 --> 07:17.470]  Nick's cone disappeared.
[07:17.670 --> 07:18.410]  I know!
[07:20.470 --> 07:21.730]  Am I shooting blanks?
[07:24.980 --> 07:26.300]  Oh, trick shot!
[07:26.960 --> 07:27.180]  Oh!
[07:29.200 --> 07:30.240]  Do it!
[07:30.240 --> 07:30.840]  Do it!
[07:31.820 --> 07:33.280]  Yeah, that must have been the one Nick went in.
[07:33.500 --> 07:35.140]  It's exactly where Nick's ball landed.
[07:35.940 --> 07:37.200]  So you went in the first hole.
[07:37.720 --> 07:40.000]  So you just answered a lot of questions that we saw off camera.
[07:40.820 --> 07:41.040]  Okay.
[07:41.880 --> 07:42.300]  Rough.
[07:42.800 --> 07:44.840]  It's not bad. It's good.
[07:45.100 --> 07:46.340]  I think I'm in second place now.
[07:48.120 --> 07:49.100]  There you go.
[07:49.180 --> 07:50.540]  Gavin's in first. Two under.
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.500]  Everyone's enjoying a tie for second.
[07:53.840 --> 07:54.600]  Where are we going?
[07:55.480 --> 07:56.300]  The loop-de-loop!
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.160]  We're looping?
[07:58.380 --> 07:59.580]  Oh, we are loop-de-looping.
[07:59.600 --> 08:00.600]  Oh my god.
[08:03.860 --> 08:05.520]  Careful with how many beans.
[08:05.740 --> 08:06.720]  Oh my god.
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.000]  Nick gave it so...
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.080]  Oh wow!
[08:09.720 --> 08:12.680]  Nick gave it a lot of beans and it wasn't enough beans.
[08:13.220 --> 08:14.420]  Are you just holding your ball
[08:14.420 --> 08:15.640]  against the club?
[08:16.500 --> 08:17.360]  What's going on?
[08:18.200 --> 08:19.060]  What's happening?
[08:20.760 --> 08:21.200]  That was weird.
[08:22.120 --> 08:23.040]  Good shot, Nick!
[08:23.040 --> 08:24.520]  What was all that?
[08:24.520 --> 08:26.020]  How did Nick get there?
[08:27.220 --> 08:29.040]  I don't know.
[08:36.620 --> 08:39.160]  The vacuum hole worked!
[08:40.360 --> 08:41.800]  There's a vacuum hole?
[08:42.920 --> 08:44.900]  Did you put your arms through the vacuum hole?
[08:46.760 --> 08:47.720]  Geoff, what happened?
[08:48.920 --> 08:50.460]  Oh, come on!
[08:51.280 --> 08:52.260]  I don't know.
[08:52.260 --> 08:53.220]  Right in front of Nick?
[08:53.720 --> 08:54.900]  What am I going to do?
[08:57.780 --> 08:59.980]  Just a tip. Go full beans.
[09:00.640 --> 09:01.020]  Oh yeah.
[09:02.780 --> 09:03.760]  There you go.
[09:04.340 --> 09:05.220]  Vacuum hole!
[09:06.620 --> 09:07.660]  You got sucked hard in.
[09:10.620 --> 09:11.260]  Alright, Nick.
[09:11.900 --> 09:12.440]  Yeah!
[09:21.660 --> 09:23.140]  Geoff's so far back.
[09:25.740 --> 09:27.640]  It's like it didn't even happen.
[09:27.920 --> 09:29.360]  It's like it didn't even happen.
[09:30.160 --> 09:32.980]  Why does full beans not even get you around the loop?
[09:34.280 --> 09:35.580]  That was full beans.
[09:39.040 --> 09:39.920]  Oh, Christ.
[09:40.720 --> 09:42.440]  Yeah, that's right. You stay in the middle this time.
[09:45.460 --> 09:46.520]  Alright, Nick. You got it.
[09:46.780 --> 09:48.280]  Right up the gut.
[09:48.280 --> 09:49.640]  Here we go.
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.120]  There it goes.
[09:52.240 --> 09:53.420]  Hey, you did the loop.
[09:53.560 --> 09:54.040]  Ready to go, buddy?
[09:55.200 --> 09:57.940]  Well, Nick, it looks like you and I are playing the next round.
[09:58.480 --> 09:58.940]  No!
[10:00.260 --> 10:02.780]  I don't think either of us are in contention to win.
[10:04.700 --> 10:05.080]  Are you?
[10:05.360 --> 10:06.380]  No way!
[10:07.700 --> 10:08.420]  Good job!
[10:08.960 --> 10:10.180]  What if it sucks Geoff in?
[10:11.300 --> 10:13.120]  What did that mean?
[10:13.120 --> 10:15.260]  How did that...
[10:15.260 --> 10:15.860]  What?
[10:16.220 --> 10:17.660]  You activated it, but it did nothing.
[10:19.660 --> 10:21.220]  Sucks Nick in, I mean.
[10:21.460 --> 10:21.780]  Fuck!
[10:24.540 --> 10:26.020]  Gonna use a little suck in.
[10:26.460 --> 10:27.620]  Oh, suck me.
[10:28.300 --> 10:29.700]  No, don't say that, Nick.
[10:30.040 --> 10:31.560]  Oh, maybe it did now.
[10:33.740 --> 10:34.100]  Oh!
[10:35.540 --> 10:36.820]  I'm out of range!
[10:41.380 --> 10:41.900]  Goddamn!
[10:42.820 --> 10:43.880]  What the hell?
[10:44.440 --> 10:46.060]  He just went for that!
[10:47.320 --> 10:47.840]  I'm gonna...
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.600]  I'm losing it.
[10:49.720 --> 10:50.940]  Nick really wants to play.
[10:51.480 --> 10:51.740]  No!
[10:54.660 --> 10:56.460]  I'm gonna make everyone's life a hell now.
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.500]  I'm gonna make everyone's life a hell.
[11:01.340 --> 11:02.800]  What was the score?
[11:04.140 --> 11:05.480]  I didn't see it.
[11:05.880 --> 11:06.360]  Somebody hit A.
[11:06.460 --> 11:07.460]  I was too busy being depressed.
[11:07.460 --> 11:08.220]  Me too.
[11:09.840 --> 11:10.700]  Alright, here you go.
[11:11.420 --> 11:12.700]  Hey, you're aimed at the hole. Go full.
[11:13.020 --> 11:15.100]  Yeah, just go full beans.
[11:15.380 --> 11:16.660]  I can tell I'm not full.
[11:17.460 --> 11:17.600]  Why?
[11:19.520 --> 11:20.620]  Don't listen to Gavin.
[11:21.700 --> 11:22.080]  Pop!
[11:23.020 --> 11:23.400]  No!
[11:24.740 --> 11:26.920]  See, if you didn't adjust, you wouldn't ride that hole.
[11:27.080 --> 11:28.040]  See, that's why you shouldn't...
[11:28.900 --> 11:30.360]  That's what adjustments will give you.
[11:31.760 --> 11:33.660]  You think you know better than the game?
[11:35.220 --> 11:35.700]  No.
[11:36.580 --> 11:37.860]  I assure you, you do not.
[11:39.300 --> 11:39.780]  See?
[11:40.080 --> 11:40.560]  See?
[11:40.560 --> 11:40.700]  See?
[11:43.480 --> 11:45.180]  What's going on with this little hole?
[11:47.540 --> 11:48.240]  Part 3000.
[11:48.520 --> 11:49.220]  I feel better about my chances.
[11:50.980 --> 11:52.260]  That's the mistake we all made.
[11:52.540 --> 11:52.960]  Oh, whoops.
[11:57.910 --> 11:59.830]  Oh, well, someone made it through.
[12:00.830 --> 12:01.930]  At what cost?
[12:03.710 --> 12:05.150]  What's going on?
[12:05.150 --> 12:05.850]  What am I doing?
[12:07.210 --> 12:08.210]  Is your ball possessed?
[12:08.870 --> 12:09.970]  Would you get on with it, please?
[12:13.030 --> 12:14.310]  Full beans, I think.
[12:14.390 --> 12:15.750]  I think that might be the answer.
[12:19.150 --> 12:19.550]  Wow!
[12:20.710 --> 12:21.110]  Oh, no!
[12:23.750 --> 12:25.010]  Right across me.
[12:26.410 --> 12:26.810]  Brutal.
[12:28.030 --> 12:28.670]  Sorry, Gavin.
[12:28.990 --> 12:29.430]  Had to be done.
[12:30.150 --> 12:30.610]  How sorry?
[12:30.610 --> 12:30.670]  Sorry.
[12:33.250 --> 12:33.690]  Wow!
[12:33.870 --> 12:35.030]  Do it, do it, do it.
[12:40.740 --> 12:43.260]  I was hoping to get some of the other areas.
[12:43.540 --> 12:45.100]  There you go, Geoff.
[12:45.560 --> 12:46.500]  Do it, do it, do it.
[12:46.920 --> 12:48.740]  Oh, he's done about this three.
[12:49.580 --> 12:50.800]  He drew a pair of legs.
[12:51.540 --> 12:52.280]  He drew it off.
[12:53.260 --> 12:54.140]  What's this?
[12:54.380 --> 12:55.360]  Alright, Gavin, go for it.
[12:56.100 --> 12:56.980]  Come on.
[12:58.480 --> 12:58.920]  No!
[13:02.460 --> 13:04.180]  Oh, you sneaky sneak!
[13:07.500 --> 13:09.600]  What are you talking about?
[13:15.340 --> 13:17.120]  Thank God for that third row.
[13:17.400 --> 13:18.240]  Oh, you think you know better.
[13:19.720 --> 13:21.080]  Oh, I'm such an idiot.
[13:21.080 --> 13:21.940]  Oh, Nick.
[13:24.220 --> 13:25.160]  I'm learning.
[13:28.190 --> 13:28.890]  Oh, man.
[13:30.030 --> 13:31.530]  Alright, Andrew, this is easy peasy for you.
[13:31.650 --> 13:32.130]  No!
[13:35.650 --> 13:37.390]  Alright, Geoff, you're... Oh, thank you.
[13:37.670 --> 13:38.150]  Thank you, Geoff.
[13:40.350 --> 13:41.690]  No problem, Geoff.
[13:42.670 --> 13:42.950]  Thank you, Geoff.
[13:44.330 --> 13:48.650]  Gavin, you're still in this thing.
[13:49.430 --> 13:50.950]  Alright, let's put this home.
[13:53.050 --> 13:57.390]  I swear to God, if you hit my ball...
[14:02.410 --> 14:02.830]  No!
[14:03.210 --> 14:04.070]  Oh, nice!
[14:04.950 --> 14:06.070]  Fuck you.
[14:06.250 --> 14:07.310]  You suck.
[14:09.730 --> 14:12.130]  This could be my game.
[14:13.430 --> 14:14.550]  Could be.
[14:14.770 --> 14:15.830]  God damn it.
[14:15.890 --> 14:16.890]  Is Nick in GTA mode?
[14:17.270 --> 14:17.430]  Nick!
[14:19.470 --> 14:21.310]  You piece of shit!
[14:23.910 --> 14:25.050]  Hey, we're going to the windows!
[14:26.750 --> 14:28.450]  I gotta try to go around.
[14:28.870 --> 14:29.890]  Trick shot, trick shot.
[14:30.110 --> 14:30.650]  You can do it.
[14:30.650 --> 14:32.170]  You can do it.
[14:32.550 --> 14:33.830]  You got this.
[14:34.370 --> 14:36.510]  Probably don't full beam too hard.
[14:36.950 --> 14:37.470]  Wow!
[14:38.530 --> 14:39.250]  What a shot.
[14:40.090 --> 14:41.090]  Take a bow.
[14:43.170 --> 14:43.690]  Geoff?
[14:44.470 --> 14:45.490]  A little harder for me.
[14:46.710 --> 14:47.690]  You can trick shot it.
[14:49.650 --> 14:50.150]  You got it.
[14:51.490 --> 14:53.210]  The rougher angle, for sure.
[14:53.670 --> 14:55.570]  You gotta give it a little more of that.
[14:56.590 --> 14:58.570]  I forgot there was a lip there.
[14:58.570 --> 14:59.070]  There we go.
[15:00.410 --> 15:01.990]  Fucking smooth sailing for Geoff.
[15:04.830 --> 15:05.650]  Easy peasy.
[15:05.850 --> 15:07.130]  Smooth sailing all the way.
[15:08.070 --> 15:09.790]  I think I just figured out this hole.
[15:10.090 --> 15:11.030]  You gotta time it with the light.
[15:12.530 --> 15:13.310]  There's a light?
[15:13.830 --> 15:14.010]  Yeah.
[15:15.690 --> 15:19.570]  I only noticed that after everyone was in the hole.
[15:21.590 --> 15:22.130]  Hey Geoff, we're tied.
[15:23.590 --> 15:25.030]  This is Eric the actor.
[15:25.110 --> 15:26.630]  I just figured that out three seconds ago.
[15:26.630 --> 15:28.010]  That's how that sounded.
[15:28.270 --> 15:29.390]  That's very exciting.
[15:29.830 --> 15:30.530]  Oh, the light.
[15:30.810 --> 15:32.470]  Gavin, what do you do here?
[15:35.230 --> 15:35.710]  What?
[15:37.410 --> 15:38.510]  Are you alright?
[15:38.890 --> 15:41.450]  You gotta hit the ball when the gopher, I think.
[15:44.750 --> 15:46.170]  That worked out pretty well.
[15:47.070 --> 15:47.870]  That's not bad.
[15:48.970 --> 15:49.690]  Could be worse.
[15:49.830 --> 15:50.470]  What was your beam count?
[15:54.810 --> 15:55.770]  Barely yellow.
[15:57.050 --> 15:58.030]  Just a little yellow.
[15:58.190 --> 15:59.490]  I don't want to bounce off that back wall.
[15:59.830 --> 16:02.630]  But you get a beamed harder, for sure.
[16:06.310 --> 16:08.270]  Somewhere in between that, I guess.
[16:08.450 --> 16:09.710]  They're like facing the ball.
[16:10.310 --> 16:10.810]  That was weird.
[16:12.470 --> 16:13.710]  I want to bail out.
[16:14.050 --> 16:14.670]  Let me bail out.
[16:15.370 --> 16:18.270]  Nick gave it full beams and then backed off.
[16:18.890 --> 16:19.830]  Nick got so scared.
[16:20.750 --> 16:22.570]  These gophers are addicted to balls
[16:22.570 --> 16:24.490]  like the bow a dowry and is to come.
[16:26.790 --> 16:27.770]  Is he addicted?
[16:27.870 --> 16:29.930]  I was under the impression that he was just doing his job.
[16:30.330 --> 16:31.970]  He's come addicted. No, it's in the book.
[16:32.090 --> 16:32.730]  He's come addicted.
[16:33.110 --> 16:34.490]  He's not on the payroll.
[16:39.970 --> 16:41.830]  Gavin, I came up with a twist
[16:41.830 --> 16:44.110]  for the next round that I'm excited
[16:44.110 --> 16:44.850]  to talk to you about.
[16:46.730 --> 16:47.170]  What?
[16:47.450 --> 16:47.870]  Oh!
[16:49.150 --> 16:49.590]  Wow!
[16:52.230 --> 16:52.750]  Nice birdie.
[16:56.630 --> 16:57.370]  You got this.
[16:58.950 --> 17:00.330]  Give it a little tapper.
[17:01.190 --> 17:02.170]  A little Jake Tapper.
[17:02.290 --> 17:03.130]  Get the fuck out of my hole.
[17:08.260 --> 17:11.020]  Oh, that's a tough shot, Nick.
[17:12.460 --> 17:12.820]  Whoa!
[17:13.260 --> 17:14.100]  Holy shit.
[17:14.260 --> 17:15.640]  That gopher popped up and went,
[17:15.940 --> 17:17.100]  this fucker missed.
[17:19.560 --> 17:20.680]  I'm sick.
[17:21.060 --> 17:21.720]  I'm not feeling good.
[17:23.940 --> 17:25.900]  I no longer feel well.
[17:26.140 --> 17:26.260]  No.
[17:27.460 --> 17:28.420]  It started
[17:28.420 --> 17:29.920]  like 20 minutes ago.
[17:32.900 --> 17:33.880]  There you go.
[17:34.500 --> 17:35.000]  I'm learning.
[17:38.660 --> 17:39.820]  I feel like now
[17:39.820 --> 17:41.800]  you're as learned as the rest of us though.
[17:42.520 --> 17:42.860]  Maybe.
[17:44.260 --> 17:45.680]  Gavin, you're killing it, dude.
[17:46.220 --> 17:47.840]  This could be my first golf win
[17:47.840 --> 17:48.280]  ever.
[17:50.180 --> 17:51.360]  What do we do?
[17:51.540 --> 17:53.540]  We decide who has what for dinner or something.
[17:53.760 --> 17:54.320]  What's the rule?
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.220]  Oh, yeah.
[17:56.200 --> 17:56.740]  Do we do that?
[17:57.300 --> 17:58.660]  Oh, sorry.
[17:59.160 --> 18:00.060]  We should do that though.
[18:00.280 --> 18:02.040]  You know what?
[18:03.340 --> 18:06.040]  I'll throw the winner an LP.
[18:07.020 --> 18:07.580]  Wow!
[18:07.940 --> 18:09.260]  Just for the first round.
[18:09.680 --> 18:11.000]  Just for the first round.
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.660]  How did that work so well?
[18:18.840 --> 18:19.440]  Oh!
[18:21.540 --> 18:22.660]  Oh, I get to walk.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.400]  I thought so too.
[18:26.260 --> 18:27.760]  Where are you going now?
[18:28.700 --> 18:29.480]  I'm dancing.
[18:29.800 --> 18:31.600]  Someone hit that hole suck.
[18:31.880 --> 18:32.740]  That little suckage.
[18:38.470 --> 18:40.430]  Well, that was not at all.
[18:40.710 --> 18:43.190]  No, I did the same thing.
[18:43.290 --> 18:44.530]  That's an exact nick, that is.
[18:46.310 --> 18:47.890]  Oh, I'm circling.
[18:49.650 --> 18:50.730]  Stop right there.
[18:50.970 --> 18:51.070]  Okay.
[18:54.550 --> 18:56.370]  Can anyone time this right?
[18:57.390 --> 18:57.810]  No.
[18:58.610 --> 18:59.170]  Yes.
[18:59.570 --> 19:00.730]  But not today.
[19:02.570 --> 19:04.190]  I believe it's never been done.
[19:04.910 --> 19:05.890]  Oh, for God's sake, no.
[19:06.910 --> 19:08.850]  Oh, that works for you.
[19:09.010 --> 19:09.570]  You're welcome.
[19:09.570 --> 19:10.850]  Triangle offense.
[19:14.410 --> 19:17.010]  Dude, Gavin is dominating.
[19:21.540 --> 19:24.400]  It only takes one hole, though, for him to completely collapse.
[19:25.120 --> 19:25.220]  Yeah.
[19:26.640 --> 19:27.820]  Oh, my God.
[19:30.260 --> 19:31.100]  He's shielded up.
[19:32.100 --> 19:32.700]  Alright.
[19:36.700 --> 19:37.860]  Hey, you're shielded.
[19:38.480 --> 19:39.180]  Shielded up.
[19:39.320 --> 19:40.240]  Gotta be safe in this environment.
[19:41.660 --> 19:43.040]  Feeling a little exposed.
[19:46.440 --> 19:48.520]  You know, the best offense is a good defense, Geoff.
[19:52.800 --> 19:52.960]  Yeah.
[19:54.640 --> 19:55.760]  Go, go, go.
[19:55.940 --> 19:56.300]  Wow.
[19:57.520 --> 19:58.140]  Thank you.
[19:59.840 --> 20:01.580]  What's that frowny face for?
[20:01.660 --> 20:02.340]  You did par.
[20:02.720 --> 20:04.860]  I think that guy's just sad.
[20:04.960 --> 20:05.880]  Cheer up, big guy.
[20:07.020 --> 20:08.360]  He's sad, too.
[20:11.340 --> 20:12.180]  Alright, here we go.
[20:12.380 --> 20:13.120]  Here we go.
[20:13.200 --> 20:13.740]  Here we go.
[20:13.900 --> 20:14.300]  Wow.
[20:17.420 --> 20:19.000]  How'd they come up with the name for this hole?
[20:23.800 --> 20:26.360]  Oh, my God.
[20:27.760 --> 20:28.160]  Wow.
[20:28.300 --> 20:30.360]  After six holes, it's...
[20:31.620 --> 20:32.320]  Oh, man.
[20:32.480 --> 20:33.220]  Moving to space.
[20:33.560 --> 20:34.040]  Oh, wow.
[20:34.040 --> 20:35.100]  Oh, hell yeah.
[20:35.140 --> 20:37.360]  The final frontier? Wow.
[20:37.900 --> 20:39.280]  Oh, you're about to blast off, Gavin.
[20:45.540 --> 20:47.280]  One way to find out.
[20:50.300 --> 20:51.860]  Nice. Nailed it.
[20:52.140 --> 20:52.600]  Nailed it.
[20:52.760 --> 20:55.760]  He jumped out of the bounds of the spring.
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.000]  I was trying to get in that hole.
[20:59.820 --> 21:00.680]  There a hole?
[21:01.340 --> 21:02.220]  There's a big hole.
[21:02.600 --> 21:03.660]  On the left.
[21:03.800 --> 21:06.100]  It looked like you were shooting straight ahead.
[21:07.080 --> 21:07.540]  Go.
[21:08.720 --> 21:08.960]  No.
[21:10.520 --> 21:11.780]  Is that one good or shit?
[21:12.620 --> 21:13.720]  That might be really good.
[21:14.640 --> 21:16.440]  You just got taken to the bank teller.
[21:16.740 --> 21:17.380]  Oh, there you go.
[21:17.380 --> 21:19.180]  Oh, that...
[21:19.180 --> 21:19.480]  Wow.
[21:22.440 --> 21:22.960]  Thanks.
[21:31.440 --> 21:32.480]  Oh, boy.
[21:33.440 --> 21:34.480]  That's exactly what I wanted.
[21:34.680 --> 21:34.920]  Oh, good.
[21:35.680 --> 21:37.160]  Right back to where you started.
[21:37.900 --> 21:39.300]  But now it's a power-up.
[21:40.380 --> 21:40.800]  That's right.
[21:40.900 --> 21:42.900]  You can turn around and just clobber him.
[21:47.010 --> 21:48.850]  Oh, Gavin is unstoppable.
[21:50.190 --> 21:50.970]  What's happening?
[21:55.510 --> 21:56.690]  You got this, Nick.
[21:57.590 --> 21:58.070]  Yeah.
[21:59.150 --> 21:59.630]  Nice.
[22:00.150 --> 22:01.370]  Oh, what a hit.
[22:02.350 --> 22:03.430]  Give me the thing.
[22:04.730 --> 22:05.990]  Hell yeah, Nick.
[22:06.310 --> 22:07.530]  Thanks, man.
[22:11.030 --> 22:11.510]  Eagle.
[22:12.770 --> 22:12.910]  Wow.
[22:13.490 --> 22:15.810]  Oh, that spaceship is about to crash.
[22:17.490 --> 22:18.790]  It's getting pretty close, guys.
[22:20.670 --> 22:21.430]  I don't think you want to...
[22:22.050 --> 22:23.110]  Oh, he's short-cutting.
[22:23.110 --> 22:23.790]  Yeah, let's see it.
[22:23.830 --> 22:25.770]  Let's see what it does.
[22:25.950 --> 22:27.030]  Is there enough rampage?
[22:28.610 --> 22:29.270]  Too much.
[22:29.690 --> 22:31.070]  Oh, the lack of gravity.
[22:32.410 --> 22:33.750]  I forgot about gravity.
[22:38.780 --> 22:40.540]  He's on fire.
[22:41.480 --> 22:43.860]  Impossible to gain ground on this guy.
[22:44.160 --> 22:44.500]  Yeah.
[22:47.580 --> 22:48.240]  There we go.
[22:48.240 --> 22:49.620]  Oh, everyone's locking in.
[22:50.240 --> 22:51.120]  Not everyone.
[22:51.120 --> 22:52.260]  How silly.
[22:53.080 --> 22:54.180]  I might be a while.
[22:54.680 --> 22:55.760]  Alright, where was I?
[22:56.840 --> 22:58.940]  It's weird that the teleport pod doesn't
[22:58.940 --> 22:59.840]  actually get you in the hole.
[23:00.460 --> 23:00.740]  No.
[23:02.240 --> 23:02.960]  You can jump.
[23:04.420 --> 23:04.640]  Oh.
[23:06.540 --> 23:06.980]  Okay.
[23:07.900 --> 23:08.340]  Alright.
[23:11.660 --> 23:12.740]  Alright, you got it.
[23:12.800 --> 23:14.040]  Look, you just sneak it up there.
[23:14.080 --> 23:14.700]  Great angle.
[23:16.900 --> 23:17.780]  Okay, well...
[23:17.780 --> 23:19.160]  Jump! Yes!
[23:19.860 --> 23:20.340]  Nice!
[23:20.660 --> 23:23.780]  I was trying to go into the hole.
[23:24.540 --> 23:25.960]  In every...
[23:25.960 --> 23:27.100]  On every...
[23:27.100 --> 23:29.800]  On every course, there's a secret hole in one.
[23:30.040 --> 23:31.340]  And I assumed that was it.
[23:31.860 --> 23:33.100]  Because they put a hole right there.
[23:33.120 --> 23:35.240]  There's a secret hole in one on every course?
[23:35.980 --> 23:36.240]  Yeah.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.800]  Yeah, that's what the suck was
[23:39.800 --> 23:40.240]  on that one.
[23:41.800 --> 23:42.220]  There you go.
[23:43.320 --> 23:44.980]  Is this just broken?
[23:44.980 --> 23:47.420]  It's just fucking awesome for Geoff.
[23:47.640 --> 23:49.280]  Geoff, I'm sorry.
[23:50.080 --> 23:51.480]  You're getting railed
[23:51.480 --> 23:52.120]  by this hole.
[23:55.060 --> 23:56.140]  Oh, you got a bomb.
[23:57.300 --> 23:58.560]  Does this carry over?
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.180]  I think so.
[24:03.140 --> 24:04.520]  Nice! Yeah!
[24:05.480 --> 24:06.800]  Only plus four.
[24:07.800 --> 24:09.280]  All the pneumatic tubes
[24:09.280 --> 24:10.380]  stopped working for me.
[24:10.720 --> 24:12.580]  Yeah. Good lord.
[24:13.160 --> 24:13.640]  Eight.
[24:14.980 --> 24:15.340]  Alright.
[24:16.900 --> 24:17.760]  Here we go.
[24:19.220 --> 24:20.680]  Set the tone, Geoff.
[24:22.400 --> 24:23.100]  Oh no!
[24:23.880 --> 24:24.300]  Oh, never mind.
[24:24.320 --> 24:24.820]  It's Andrew's turn.
[24:25.460 --> 24:27.160]  On my screen, I thought it was you.
[24:27.640 --> 24:29.340]  It was briefly.
[24:30.640 --> 24:32.220]  I wasn't prepared for this.
[24:32.880 --> 24:34.420]  Can you get a pneumatic tube
[24:34.420 --> 24:35.300]  installed in your house?
[24:36.140 --> 24:37.500]  I assume so. Like at the bank?
[24:37.680 --> 24:38.040]  Yeah.
[24:38.040 --> 24:38.300]  Yeah.
[24:39.260 --> 24:40.400]  You know what you should do?
[24:41.840 --> 24:43.420]  It would be cool if you did them
[24:43.420 --> 24:46.260]  it would deliver clothes to the laundry bin.
[24:46.520 --> 24:48.040]  Oh. Like a laundry chute
[24:48.040 --> 24:48.600]  but upwards?
[24:49.520 --> 24:50.840]  You'd have to keep bailing out.
[24:50.840 --> 24:51.420]  One at a time.
[24:59.060 --> 25:00.080]  Andrew bailed twice
[25:00.080 --> 25:01.000]  on it. I thought that was great.
[25:01.160 --> 25:02.440]  Oh, you wrecked the hole?
[25:05.000 --> 25:05.920]  Don't do what I did.
[25:07.320 --> 25:08.060]  Bowed.
[25:10.560 --> 25:11.640]  Oh, nice, Geoff.
[25:13.840 --> 25:14.580]  Wow.
[25:16.020 --> 25:17.820]  What the fuck?
[25:18.060 --> 25:18.480]  What?
[25:19.500 --> 25:21.340]  What the hell is going on there?
[25:23.630 --> 25:24.740]  What happened?
[25:25.960 --> 25:27.460]  The fuck happened to me?
[25:27.480 --> 25:29.540]  You got thrown by a tentacle and you combed everywhere?
[25:30.200 --> 25:30.560]  Wow.
[25:31.020 --> 25:33.940]  I think that's a sequel.
[25:34.580 --> 25:35.620]  Point out any
[25:35.620 --> 25:37.260]  pointables you guys might see here.
[25:37.500 --> 25:38.200]  Thank you.
[25:39.960 --> 25:41.620]  So, what's good and what's bad?
[25:41.700 --> 25:42.900]  Is the laser good? I have no idea.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.160]  What's the secret hole in one?
[25:44.500 --> 25:46.480]  I think the laser is probably good.
[25:47.860 --> 25:48.800]  Oh, yeah. Touch the laser, Gavin.
[25:49.080 --> 25:50.640]  I bet it's not. Bowed.
[25:53.420 --> 25:53.840]  Whack.
[25:55.440 --> 25:56.440]  Oh, shit.
[25:56.820 --> 25:58.280]  You sat and combed.
[25:58.400 --> 25:59.920]  Gavin sat and combed.
[25:59.920 --> 26:00.120]  It's gone.
[26:01.760 --> 26:02.560]  It's gross.
[26:05.880 --> 26:07.140]  Oh, comb avoider.
[26:09.240 --> 26:10.040]  Oh, shit.
[26:13.880 --> 26:15.560]  Nick said, get out of my way.
[26:15.620 --> 26:16.760]  I want to go to Comb City.
[26:17.260 --> 26:18.320]  That's not what I wanted.
[26:18.660 --> 26:19.700]  I didn't want to go to Comb City.
[26:20.500 --> 26:21.920]  Nick's the mayor of Comb Town.
[26:28.640 --> 26:29.040]  Whoa.
[26:29.740 --> 26:31.400]  I got to remember about that gravity.
[26:31.800 --> 26:32.780]  It sounds like the
[26:32.780 --> 26:34.220]  Abe's Odyssey alarm.
[26:36.800 --> 26:37.940]  That's what I was thinking, too.
[26:38.020 --> 26:40.380]  Was that the game you played the demo of a lot?
[26:40.900 --> 26:41.300]  Yeah.
[26:42.960 --> 26:44.740]  That's a hell of a hill.
[26:45.380 --> 26:46.460]  It's a real steep one.
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.100]  Y'all are going to want to get that
[26:49.100 --> 26:49.680]  in the orange.
[26:51.940 --> 26:52.980]  Whoops.
[26:56.080 --> 26:57.480]  Well.
[26:59.200 --> 26:59.380]  Wow.
[27:00.280 --> 27:03.340]  That presents a challenge.
[27:05.180 --> 27:05.740]  Oh, yeah.
[27:17.380 --> 27:19.600]  Nick, what a play.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.740]  That was phenomenal.
[27:23.720 --> 27:25.900]  We've had seven holes of just pleasant play.
[27:26.360 --> 27:27.720]  What the hell was that?
[27:27.840 --> 27:28.140]  No.
[27:28.960 --> 27:29.560]  Dude.
[27:31.460 --> 27:34.060]  You just got evicted by the mayor of Comb Town.
[27:34.060 --> 27:35.580]  That sucks.
[27:35.920 --> 27:37.860]  I don't want that to take
[27:37.860 --> 27:40.100]  or stick, for lack of a better term.
[27:40.600 --> 27:41.740]  It's pretty sticky.
[27:41.860 --> 27:43.220]  No way. Not again.
[27:43.660 --> 27:45.660]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[27:46.820 --> 27:48.140]  Oh, did you suck someone in?
[27:48.540 --> 27:48.780]  Yeah.
[27:49.840 --> 27:50.440]  No.
[27:52.040 --> 27:52.480]  Oh, okay.
[27:54.180 --> 27:55.320]  We're out of range.
[27:55.900 --> 27:57.960]  Why are the tentacles into me?
[28:03.230 --> 28:03.610]  No!
[28:04.890 --> 28:06.490]  Oh, thank God.
[28:08.170 --> 28:09.450]  It's happening!
[28:10.830 --> 28:11.910]  It's happening!
[28:12.590 --> 28:14.010]  I was minus eight.
[28:14.650 --> 28:15.890]  Oh, the unraveling
[28:15.890 --> 28:16.610]  of Gavin Free.
[28:17.290 --> 28:19.350]  Son of a bitch.
[28:19.890 --> 28:20.670]  What are you doing?
[28:21.170 --> 28:21.870]  I'm waiting.
[28:23.610 --> 28:24.090]  I'm waiting.
[28:24.470 --> 28:26.550]  Oh, I fucked Andrew, though.
[28:26.810 --> 28:28.410]  What are you doing?
[28:29.350 --> 28:31.910]  Well, Nick has turned into a super villain.
[28:31.910 --> 28:34.010]  No, I was gonna help Andrew
[28:34.010 --> 28:35.890]  and I hurt him. I hurt him so bad.
[28:36.610 --> 28:38.270]  Nick just put his Thanos glove on.
[28:38.650 --> 28:39.450]  I'm snapping.
[28:39.730 --> 28:41.250]  I keep snapping.
[28:43.650 --> 28:45.130]  Oh, God, this is great.
[28:46.390 --> 28:47.590]  Oh, this is gonna hurt.
[28:55.330 --> 28:56.630]  Oh, sweet, this hole.
[29:02.530 --> 29:03.910]  Oh, I was hoping that thing would've
[29:03.910 --> 29:04.550]  opened again.
[29:06.630 --> 29:15.110]  You got this.
[29:15.510 --> 29:16.970]  Oh, no.
[29:17.170 --> 29:18.610]  What are you doing?
[29:22.070 --> 29:22.550]  Nick.
[29:23.810 --> 29:25.390]  Did that send Geoff?
[29:25.670 --> 29:27.110]  No, he's still in.
[29:28.250 --> 29:29.550]  No, he's way down there.
[29:29.550 --> 29:31.370]  No, no, no, I'm fucked.
[29:31.830 --> 29:32.670]  Nick fucked me.
[29:32.750 --> 29:34.910]  I don't understand what Nick is doing.
[29:35.550 --> 29:36.770]  I'm trying to help Andrew.
[29:37.550 --> 29:38.670]  How's that going?
[29:40.090 --> 29:41.550]  Well, not great.
[29:42.350 --> 29:43.470]  Oh, nice, Geoff.
[29:43.730 --> 29:45.490]  Geoff, light me up. I deserve it.
[29:47.630 --> 29:49.230]  Please get grabbed by a tentacle.
[29:49.570 --> 29:50.550]  Nick, Nick, Nick.
[29:51.190 --> 29:55.410]  Oh, I don't even...
[29:55.410 --> 29:57.370]  Oh, you're not even lined up.
[29:59.550 --> 30:01.330]  Do it, do it.
[30:01.910 --> 30:02.790]  You got it.
[30:03.210 --> 30:03.770]  Oh!
[30:04.770 --> 30:06.230]  No, no.
[30:07.290 --> 30:07.570]  Yes!
[30:10.130 --> 30:10.690]  Why?
[30:17.510 --> 30:18.770]  Who did Gavin kill?
[30:19.210 --> 30:19.830]  Oh, no.
[30:21.290 --> 30:23.590]  Wait, I thought I hit Nick.
[30:23.610 --> 30:24.230]  It wasn't Nick.
[30:24.450 --> 30:25.130]  Oh, shit.
[30:25.890 --> 30:26.650]  Oh, shit.
[30:27.110 --> 30:28.910]  Did you just push him up there?
[30:29.370 --> 30:30.770]  Yes, he did.
[30:32.910 --> 30:35.130]  I don't... you... this is not...
[30:35.710 --> 30:36.130]  Where's my...
[30:36.130 --> 30:37.750]  Oh, there it is.
[30:38.350 --> 30:39.510]  Oh, my God!
[30:42.890 --> 30:45.110]  Gavin, Gavin, it's not the hole. It's not real.
[30:46.750 --> 30:49.450]  I'm in last place, dude. It doesn't do you any good to hit me.
[30:49.610 --> 30:51.130]  No, I don't wanna... I'm just looking for Nick.
[30:51.190 --> 30:51.930]  I can't even see him.
[30:52.650 --> 30:53.810]  Yeah, I disappeared.
[30:54.130 --> 30:54.690]  He's down at the bottom.
[30:55.130 --> 30:57.130]  He's by that thing that's opening and closing.
[30:57.790 --> 30:59.410]  Nick, I'll see you on the next hole, yeah?
[30:59.690 --> 31:00.110]  No.
[31:01.630 --> 31:03.290]  Full beans, full beans, full beans.
[31:03.790 --> 31:04.630]  Nice shot.
[31:04.950 --> 31:07.550]  I'm helping Andrew.
[31:08.110 --> 31:10.830]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[31:11.170 --> 31:14.290]  All of that brought me one stroke closer.
[31:14.630 --> 31:15.070]  Just one.
[31:15.070 --> 31:16.670]  One stroke closer than you were.
[31:16.870 --> 31:18.990]  I would've been closer if you were trying to help,
[31:18.990 --> 31:20.830]  because you blocked my way.
[31:23.070 --> 31:23.630]  Whoops.
[31:24.210 --> 31:25.770]  I think Nick made an enemy of everyone.
[31:26.330 --> 31:26.550]  No!
[31:27.810 --> 31:29.370]  Nobody like that.
[31:31.810 --> 31:33.230]  Fucking hell, dude.
[31:34.750 --> 31:37.450]  Thank you for at least three of those, Nick.
[31:38.130 --> 31:39.330]  That annihilated my lead.
[31:39.750 --> 31:42.870]  It really didn't.
[31:42.930 --> 31:43.790]  It didn't at all.
[31:43.790 --> 31:45.090]  It took him down by one.
[31:45.090 --> 31:45.630]  Yeah.
[31:46.390 --> 31:48.190]  No, I mean my lead against the pause.
[31:49.090 --> 31:49.730]  Oh, yeah.
[31:49.970 --> 31:52.150]  He's not playing against golf.
[31:53.050 --> 31:53.370]  Yeah.
[31:55.250 --> 31:56.410]  He's playing against us a little.
[31:58.350 --> 31:59.410]  Oh, you're only down by two.
[31:59.970 --> 32:01.110]  Last hole, flip it around.
[32:01.210 --> 32:01.510]  Here we go.
[32:01.670 --> 32:02.290]  I can help you.
[32:04.830 --> 32:06.570]  Who sits out next round? Is it the winner?
[32:06.910 --> 32:08.370]  Yeah, I thought the winner would sit out,
[32:08.430 --> 32:09.390]  but it's up to you guys, really.
[32:10.810 --> 32:11.350]  I'll sit out.
[32:12.350 --> 32:13.730]  I don't mind.
[32:16.350 --> 32:16.690]  Oh!
[32:17.430 --> 32:19.190]  This is some home cooking.
[32:19.510 --> 32:22.030]  A fucking pinball level on the final one.
[32:22.030 --> 32:22.130]  What is this?
[32:22.470 --> 32:23.010]  Hell, yeah.
[32:24.590 --> 32:25.730]  Where are your other cameras?
[32:26.010 --> 32:28.350]  It's no Space Cadet, but...
[32:28.350 --> 32:30.110]  Can you control the flippers, Geoff?
[32:31.590 --> 32:32.830]  Yeah, hit the flippers.
[32:33.110 --> 32:34.570]  No, I can't.
[32:35.410 --> 32:36.430]  Wish I could.
[32:36.670 --> 32:37.510]  Yeah, B.
[32:37.510 --> 32:37.610]  B.
[32:38.750 --> 32:41.390]  Okay, so the answer...
[32:41.390 --> 32:41.490]  It's B.
[32:42.330 --> 32:44.110]  It was the last button I pressed.
[32:45.650 --> 32:47.470]  The last button you pressed was to use...
[32:47.470 --> 32:49.050]  What is with...
[32:49.050 --> 32:51.190]  What's with everyone in this company
[32:51.190 --> 32:53.030]  answering the question
[32:53.830 --> 32:54.870]  and then going,
[32:55.230 --> 32:56.930]  wait, give me one more second.
[32:57.270 --> 32:58.230]  I was wrong.
[32:58.530 --> 33:01.430]  I forgot about B. I assumed it would be triggers.
[33:01.690 --> 33:01.990]  It wasn't.
[33:02.030 --> 33:03.410]  I want independent flippage, though.
[33:03.410 --> 33:04.430]  I don't want to use the flip.
[33:05.570 --> 33:07.090]  You better start tilting.
[33:14.450 --> 33:16.330]  That's worse than Sonic Spinball.
[33:20.030 --> 33:25.350]  Whoa, all the way with the beans.
[33:26.150 --> 33:26.530]  Yeah.
[33:27.310 --> 33:28.950]  Your ball is growing.
[33:29.370 --> 33:29.970]  Yeah, it is.
[33:29.970 --> 33:30.870]  Oh, you went over.
[33:31.710 --> 33:32.070]  No!
[33:32.710 --> 33:34.090]  I mean, did you just not hit the button?
[33:35.670 --> 33:36.790]  Why would you need to?
[33:36.870 --> 33:37.990]  It's right in the middle of it.
[33:38.370 --> 33:39.350]  What a mess.
[33:41.290 --> 33:42.570]  I'm on my way!
[33:44.050 --> 33:44.770]  Eric, sure.
[33:48.610 --> 33:49.150]  Oh, what a hit.
[33:49.250 --> 33:51.170]  See, but the hole's like right between them.
[33:51.250 --> 33:53.970]  So if it just rolls in there...
[33:54.770 --> 33:55.190]  You what?
[33:55.850 --> 33:57.110]  Can't go back to the start.
[33:58.950 --> 33:59.610]  You what?
[34:01.750 --> 34:03.630]  Oh, you teased that rim.
[34:04.930 --> 34:07.010]  Wait for you to get thrown back.
[34:08.190 --> 34:09.230]  You what?
[34:17.650 --> 34:19.210]  See, it should just roll right in.
[34:20.630 --> 34:21.970]  Oh, that's the hole you want?
[34:22.590 --> 34:23.050]  Yes!
[34:23.990 --> 34:25.110]  That's what Nick thinks.
[34:26.550 --> 34:28.330]  Where else is the hole, Eric?
[34:28.790 --> 34:31.170]  The two at the top that are flashing?
[34:31.850 --> 34:32.330]  Yeah.
[34:32.770 --> 34:33.350]  Those are holes?
[34:33.590 --> 34:34.990]  The ones that you were teasing.
[34:38.030 --> 34:38.510]  Geoff!
[34:39.870 --> 34:40.790]  Those are holes?
[34:44.890 --> 34:45.690]  Oh, no!
[34:46.430 --> 34:47.230]  Oh, that's it.
[34:48.130 --> 34:48.870]  No, he's gonna miss.
[34:50.330 --> 34:50.810]  Yeah, do it.
[34:51.630 --> 34:52.570]  Let's do it.
[34:52.570 --> 34:53.610]  Who just went in the hole?
[34:54.210 --> 34:54.570]  Geoff.
[34:56.290 --> 34:56.930]  Oh, no.
[34:57.250 --> 34:58.290]  Geoff didn't.
[34:59.750 --> 34:59.910]  Oh!
[35:01.370 --> 35:02.830]  What a shot!
[35:03.170 --> 35:04.250]  What a revenge!
[35:04.670 --> 35:10.080]  Oh, man.
[35:13.780 --> 35:14.840]  Oh, goddammit.
[35:15.100 --> 35:15.720]  What was that?
[35:17.620 --> 35:19.660]  I'm trying to protect Andrew!
[35:19.920 --> 35:20.700]  Andrew, use your sticky.
[35:20.860 --> 35:22.100]  The last two holes.
[35:22.100 --> 35:24.000]  Andrew, use the sticky!
[35:25.260 --> 35:26.480]  It wouldn't matter.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.380]  Oh, man.
[35:29.740 --> 35:31.900]  Gavin, did I block you?
[35:32.380 --> 35:33.120]  Did I stop you?
[35:39.560 --> 35:45.810]  Yeah, get him.
[35:50.670 --> 35:51.990]  Oh, god.
[35:53.350 --> 35:55.170]  It's just the stupidest war of attrition.
[35:57.890 --> 35:58.510]  All right.
[35:58.590 --> 35:59.130]  For glory.
[36:02.190 --> 36:02.630]  No!
[36:03.610 --> 36:04.930]  It would have been so funny if you missed that.
[36:06.490 --> 36:07.370]  I think...
[36:07.370 --> 36:08.790]  Oh, wait, do we tie?
[36:09.170 --> 36:09.970]  I think you did.
[36:12.890 --> 36:13.730]  What does that mean?
[36:15.170 --> 36:16.310]  What happens if we tie?
[36:17.610 --> 36:18.330]  Oh, shit.
[36:19.510 --> 36:19.950]  Wow!
[36:20.710 --> 36:22.930]  Well, I'm not giving you both an LP.
[36:23.470 --> 36:25.190]  Buy one and then break it in half.
[36:25.190 --> 36:27.570]  I could do that.
[36:27.670 --> 36:29.310]  What if we do a...
[36:31.910 --> 36:33.130]  How do we do a tiebreaker?
[36:33.430 --> 36:34.250]  Do a one-on-one.
[36:34.670 --> 36:37.030]  Oh, we're doing a one-on-one next?
[36:37.690 --> 36:38.450]  Well, here's the thing.
[36:39.850 --> 36:40.810]  Here's what you do.
[36:41.230 --> 36:43.670]  Keep the same four right now.
[36:43.850 --> 36:45.150]  So you just go into another game.
[36:45.750 --> 36:47.490]  But it's a one-on-one.
[36:47.590 --> 36:49.050]  Andrew and Gavin.
[36:49.770 --> 36:52.590]  Like, that's what we're working with here.
[36:53.350 --> 36:53.970]  Nick and Geoff.
[36:53.970 --> 36:59.390]  What if we do the second nine holes, but the winner of this nine holes is determined on the first hole of the next nine holes?
[36:59.830 --> 37:00.090]  Right.
[37:00.890 --> 37:02.070]  Yes, I like that.
[37:02.630 --> 37:03.930]  Gavin, you're a genius.
[37:04.710 --> 37:05.630]  That is a brilliant move, Gavin.
[37:05.630 --> 37:07.050]  So we're doing ten holes, then eight holes.
[37:09.190 --> 37:09.670]  Got it.
[37:09.730 --> 37:11.830]  Perfect. Go for it. Keep the same four. Do it again.
[37:12.170 --> 37:13.450]  Here we are for the second nine.
[37:13.450 --> 37:14.150]  Oh, boy.
[37:15.790 --> 37:16.550]  We're in the back nine.
[37:17.850 --> 37:18.650]  Oh, shit.
[37:18.650 --> 37:20.110]  Yeah, Geoff.
[37:20.230 --> 37:23.250]  First hole declared determines the...
[37:23.250 --> 37:25.190]  Geoff, we're in the back nine.
[37:25.550 --> 37:26.650]  Back nine.
[37:26.930 --> 37:27.730]  Mario Galaxy.
[37:29.050 --> 37:31.550]  First hole determines winner of last round.
[37:31.830 --> 37:32.650]  Oh, this is dizzying.
[37:32.670 --> 37:32.790]  Whoa!
[37:33.270 --> 37:35.330]  This is so dizzying, too.
[37:35.730 --> 37:37.090]  You're coming all the way around.
[37:38.630 --> 37:39.450]  Back to the start.
[37:39.530 --> 37:39.790]  Keep going.
[37:41.810 --> 37:42.930]  What the fuck?
[37:44.170 --> 37:45.670]  You should be lined up with the hole right here.
[37:47.170 --> 37:48.530]  You don't need to hit it hard.
[37:48.630 --> 37:49.950]  Oh, he bailed.
[37:50.690 --> 37:52.730]  I hit that a little less than...
[37:52.730 --> 37:53.670]  Oh, shit.
[37:55.050 --> 37:55.330]  What?
[37:56.610 --> 37:57.870]  Are we in orbit with Gavin?
[37:58.750 --> 37:59.030]  Oh.
[38:00.510 --> 38:01.690]  That's crazy, dude.
[38:01.710 --> 38:02.970]  That was awesome.
[38:03.710 --> 38:05.110]  Can you hit into the asteroid?
[38:06.150 --> 38:06.430]  Probably.
[38:06.730 --> 38:07.730]  How hard did you hit that?
[38:10.930 --> 38:11.890]  That rolls.
[38:13.470 --> 38:13.910]  Ah!
[38:14.350 --> 38:14.450]  Oh.
[38:15.990 --> 38:17.810]  Gavin's attempt at winning the first round.
[38:17.910 --> 38:18.670]  Wait, it's coming back down.
[38:19.230 --> 38:19.670]  Oh!
[38:19.970 --> 38:23.230]  That would have been incredible.
[38:24.610 --> 38:26.810]  Andrew, I have a feeling it's all yours to win.
[38:26.830 --> 38:28.490]  No, I shot into space, too.
[38:28.910 --> 38:29.350]  We've tied.
[38:29.550 --> 38:29.990]  Oh, you did?
[38:30.710 --> 38:31.710]  You're a genius.
[38:34.730 --> 38:36.330]  He's on the back nine.
[38:36.590 --> 38:37.250]  Here we go.
[38:37.610 --> 38:38.970]  Oh, he's on the back nine.
[38:38.970 --> 38:39.710]  Yeah!
[38:42.510 --> 38:43.250]  And I wait here
[38:43.250 --> 38:44.430]  for my next competitor.
[38:44.890 --> 38:46.670]  Dude, that roid has a hole in it.
[38:47.950 --> 38:48.930]  That would probably hurt.
[38:50.370 --> 38:52.070]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[38:52.210 --> 38:52.790]  Tuck me in!
[38:53.470 --> 38:53.950]  Dickhead.
[38:54.010 --> 38:55.770]  That's the one that blows it away.
[38:56.610 --> 38:57.090]  Dickhead.
[38:57.350 --> 38:58.450]  No touchy.
[39:00.410 --> 39:02.170]  I got nervous. I got scared.
[39:02.370 --> 39:04.190]  You went the complete other way.
[39:04.250 --> 39:05.570]  I went way too soft.
[39:05.570 --> 39:05.890]  Yeah.
[39:06.950 --> 39:08.370]  That'll happen on the back nine.
[39:09.170 --> 39:11.230]  Oh, Gavin's on the back nine.
[39:11.490 --> 39:12.190]  Look at that hole.
[39:12.750 --> 39:14.830]  You can make it.
[39:15.030 --> 39:16.850]  Look at that giant potato in space.
[39:18.070 --> 39:18.830]  Spud sauce.
[39:22.020 --> 39:22.220]  Oops.
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.160]  Uh-oh.
[39:24.780 --> 39:25.040]  Oh!
[39:26.380 --> 39:27.760]  Get out of bounds.
[39:28.320 --> 39:29.960]  Oh my God, that'd be awesome.
[39:30.200 --> 39:30.600]  You idiot.
[39:32.300 --> 39:33.680]  Alright, Nick, you got this.
[39:33.680 --> 39:34.460]  This is all you, Nick.
[39:35.700 --> 39:37.120]  I'm not playing for anything.
[39:38.380 --> 39:40.040]  You're playing for the winner of the next round.
[39:40.600 --> 39:42.400]  Look at that. What a shot.
[39:43.340 --> 39:43.500]  Nice.
[39:44.420 --> 39:45.420]  There he goes.
[39:45.600 --> 39:45.820]  The eagle.
[39:46.720 --> 39:47.760]  Go, eagles.
[39:49.780 --> 39:50.680]  Let's not go nuts.
[39:51.180 --> 39:52.140]  You were in the eagles jersey.
[39:53.200 --> 39:54.640]  I know, I did it to be ironic.
[39:56.780 --> 39:57.680]  Where is the...
[39:58.780 --> 39:59.600]  It's a little further up.
[39:59.620 --> 40:01.320]  It's gonna be one of those rounds for Geoff.
[40:01.320 --> 40:01.500]  Geoff.
[40:04.820 --> 40:06.680]  There you go, buddy.
[40:06.920 --> 40:09.320]  Oh, bad news, buddy.
[40:10.080 --> 40:11.360]  Bad news, buddy.
[40:12.560 --> 40:13.540]  I'm still, I think,
[40:13.780 --> 40:14.660]  at the beginning.
[40:15.280 --> 40:15.560]  You are.
[40:15.960 --> 40:19.220]  How do I get it in the hole from here?
[40:20.180 --> 40:20.720]  Turn around.
[40:22.900 --> 40:24.060]  Bright eyes.
[40:27.900 --> 40:29.720]  Guys, that sounds just like the music.
[40:29.720 --> 40:31.740]  We're gonna get copyrighted.
[40:31.860 --> 40:32.620]  Uh-oh.
[40:32.900 --> 40:34.500]  Oh, what a shot.
[40:35.760 --> 40:37.320]  Oh, it's coming back.
[40:38.200 --> 40:38.520]  Wow.
[40:40.020 --> 40:40.540]  Wow.
[40:41.520 --> 40:42.700]  Congratulations, Geoff.
[40:42.820 --> 40:44.240]  I'm gonna start calling him vinyl free.
[40:45.500 --> 40:46.800]  When there's vinyl on the line.
[40:48.380 --> 40:49.880]  You suck, Geoff.
[40:50.700 --> 40:51.700]  Yeah, tell him.
[40:53.520 --> 40:53.780]  Hey, Geoff,
[40:53.860 --> 40:55.220]  if you had won, would you have bought yourself an LP?
[40:56.680 --> 40:57.140]  No.
[40:57.140 --> 40:58.560]  Probably not.
[40:59.120 --> 40:59.960]  God, look at that.
[41:02.180 --> 41:06.920]  Stupid, dumb hole.
[41:07.200 --> 41:08.820]  Was Lionel Richie's first album called
[41:08.820 --> 41:09.580]  Vinyl Richie?
[41:10.980 --> 41:12.340]  No, but it probably should have been.
[41:14.020 --> 41:14.700]  Looks like
[41:14.700 --> 41:17.320]  Gavin won the previous
[41:17.320 --> 41:17.820]  nine holes.
[41:18.640 --> 41:19.320]  Bullshit.
[41:20.700 --> 41:22.700]  You made some terrible shots, man.
[41:23.140 --> 41:23.960]  I sure did.
[41:27.140 --> 41:27.800]  Oh, no.
[41:30.780 --> 41:31.260]  Okay.
[41:32.980 --> 41:34.960]  What a shot.
[41:35.500 --> 41:36.220]  Look at that.
[41:38.720 --> 41:41.340]  Hey, Geoff, you know what we could do right now?
[41:41.460 --> 41:41.760]  Oh, never mind.
[41:41.940 --> 41:42.260]  What's that?
[41:42.480 --> 41:48.160]  I gotta get on that spaceship and take off.
[41:49.500 --> 41:51.340]  Well, congratulations to Gavin.
[41:51.560 --> 41:52.220]  Thank you.
[41:52.780 --> 41:55.280]  Gavin won the first ten.
[41:55.280 --> 41:57.500]  But now, who wins the championship
[41:57.500 --> 41:57.980]  eight?
[41:58.320 --> 42:00.080]  Should we consider the zero?
[42:00.580 --> 42:01.700]  Yeah, we have to subtract
[42:03.380 --> 42:05.460]  those scores from the final score.
[42:06.880 --> 42:08.900]  Plus two, plus two, zero, minus two.
[42:09.980 --> 42:10.880]  You'll see them again.
[42:11.360 --> 42:11.940]  Who's what?
[42:13.480 --> 42:14.600]  They'll always be there.
[42:15.180 --> 42:17.160]  Andrew, you were plus two, Geoff was plus two,
[42:17.540 --> 42:18.900]  Nick was minus two, Gavin
[42:19.480 --> 42:20.400]  was zero.
[42:21.040 --> 42:21.720]  He's on the money.
[42:23.580 --> 42:24.060]  Okay.
[42:24.240 --> 42:26.120]  I wonder if it needed a bit more beans than that.
[42:26.160 --> 42:26.700]  A bit more beans?
[42:27.100 --> 42:29.580]  I think that was pretty good, though. I liked it.
[42:30.960 --> 42:31.920]  Big fan of gravity.
[42:34.380 --> 42:35.520]  Where's my tape measure?
[42:36.380 --> 42:36.860]  What?
[42:41.060 --> 42:42.580]  That looks pretty lined up.
[42:43.780 --> 42:44.740]  Right at the beginning?
[42:45.740 --> 42:46.400]  Lined up with a hole?
[42:47.660 --> 42:48.140]  Shit.
[42:49.080 --> 42:51.580]  Well, maybe a little bit more beans.
[42:55.800 --> 42:56.840]  All right.
[42:56.840 --> 42:59.040]  An appropriate amount of beans there, Nick.
[42:59.100 --> 42:59.480]  Good work.
[42:59.640 --> 43:00.580]  Thank you.
[43:01.180 --> 43:02.340]  Where were you sitting there, Nick?
[43:03.320 --> 43:05.180]  Just at the touch of orange.
[43:06.180 --> 43:06.700]  Same.
[43:07.460 --> 43:07.760]  Beautiful.
[43:09.580 --> 43:11.300]  I'm making the same mistake twice!
[43:11.740 --> 43:13.920]  You also did not let me answer before you did it.
[43:14.360 --> 43:14.880]  Nope.
[43:16.040 --> 43:16.860]  Was that full beans?
[43:17.560 --> 43:18.480]  Not quite.
[43:20.340 --> 43:21.460]  7 eighth of beans.
[43:21.460 --> 43:23.560]  It's like 98 beans.
[43:23.820 --> 43:25.360]  That looked good.
[43:26.680 --> 43:27.520]  Was that like
[43:27.520 --> 43:29.280]  13 sixteenths beans there?
[43:30.620 --> 43:31.960]  I only deal with metric beans.
[43:32.440 --> 43:33.740]  I hate these
[43:33.740 --> 43:35.120]  weird angles.
[43:35.640 --> 43:37.300]  Oh, that worked so okay.
[43:42.240 --> 43:43.740]  I agree, Andrew.
[43:43.800 --> 43:45.920]  It should be way more convenient to golf on an asteroid.
[43:45.920 --> 43:46.220]  I agree.
[43:48.600 --> 43:49.360]  Uh oh.
[43:49.640 --> 43:51.500]  Wow! Oh boy!
[43:51.840 --> 43:52.420]  Don't fuck myself.
[43:53.580 --> 43:54.280]  Oh, Geoff.
[43:58.260 --> 43:58.940]  Thank you.
[43:59.480 --> 43:59.820]  Oof.
[44:00.760 --> 44:02.860]  I can live with that.
[44:03.340 --> 44:03.940]  Setup shot.
[44:04.440 --> 44:06.820]  I don't know what you're fucking doing.
[44:09.120 --> 44:12.140]  You should not be able to see me through the asteroid!
[44:12.140 --> 44:14.140]  Oh, shit!
[44:16.180 --> 44:17.500]  It sucked!
[44:19.040 --> 44:20.200]  Shit sucker!
[44:21.720 --> 44:24.260]  Oh, God.
[44:24.840 --> 44:26.100]  The timing on that.
[44:27.160 --> 44:29.060]  Sucking shit can make you sneeze.
[44:29.660 --> 44:31.380]  Yeah, I'm allergic to success.
[44:37.410 --> 44:38.010]  Little tap.
[44:39.610 --> 44:40.950]  You'll get a next one.
[44:41.530 --> 44:42.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:45.150 --> 44:45.830]  Oh, man.
[44:45.870 --> 44:46.610]  It really...
[44:46.610 --> 44:47.870]  Not being able to see the whole...
[44:49.190 --> 44:49.690]  Got it.
[44:49.750 --> 44:50.910]  I had to go vinyl shopping.
[44:51.150 --> 44:52.230]  God damn it!
[44:56.350 --> 44:57.530]  You know what we should do, Eric?
[44:57.570 --> 44:57.850]  What's that?
[44:58.830 --> 45:00.990]  We should do a regulation supplemental
[45:01.330 --> 45:03.450]  where you and I go vinyl shopping.
[45:03.550 --> 45:03.890]  Oh, I love that.
[45:04.410 --> 45:05.390]  I think it's a great idea.
[45:06.450 --> 45:08.130]  What are you doing Thursday?
[45:09.530 --> 45:10.890]  Vinyl shopping with you, I think.
[45:11.050 --> 45:12.050]  Sounds right. Let me send the invite.
[45:12.550 --> 45:12.990]  Gavin!
[45:13.570 --> 45:14.750]  You wanna do a little AM stuff?
[45:15.330 --> 45:17.690]  Yeah, can we do the lavs like in Anima?
[45:21.530 --> 45:22.970]  You wanna do a little 10 AM action?
[45:23.990 --> 45:24.510]  That sounds great.
[45:24.910 --> 45:26.470]  Let me jump on my calendar.
[45:29.550 --> 45:30.390]  It's in the hole!
[45:31.750 --> 45:32.150]  Yeah!
[45:33.930 --> 45:35.550]  Oh, man. Plus three.
[45:37.910 --> 45:38.710]  Alright, Gavin.
[45:48.750 --> 45:49.350]  That's crazy.
[45:49.470 --> 45:49.770]  What was that?
[45:50.870 --> 45:51.270]  What?
[45:53.850 --> 45:54.650]  Plus four.
[45:56.010 --> 45:56.970]  Space is unpredictable.
[45:57.350 --> 45:59.470]  Oh, that was dark.
[45:59.570 --> 46:01.150]  How many vinyls Geoff's gonna owe you
[46:01.150 --> 46:01.850]  by the end of the week?
[46:03.610 --> 46:04.010]  So...
[46:04.010 --> 46:05.930]  So far, I owe him two right now.
[46:07.410 --> 46:08.490]  Didn't you already owe me two?
[46:09.350 --> 46:10.610]  No, I owed you one.
[46:10.610 --> 46:12.770]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[46:12.850 --> 46:14.550]  Technically, I owe you three, but I've already got one.
[46:14.830 --> 46:15.830]  I just haven't given it to you yet.
[46:16.390 --> 46:17.330]  I owe you two more.
[46:17.970 --> 46:20.490]  You're really fucking cleaning up on the vinyl thing.
[46:23.210 --> 46:23.690]  Okay.
[46:26.450 --> 46:26.930]  Whoa.
[46:27.830 --> 46:28.570]  Oh, interesting.
[46:30.390 --> 46:31.850]  That would've been awesome.
[46:33.950 --> 46:36.730]  I think Gavin's just incentivized by
[46:38.030 --> 46:38.510]  plastics.
[46:39.550 --> 46:40.050]  So...
[46:41.890 --> 46:42.790]  I wonder.
[46:43.330 --> 46:44.750]  Me too. I saw that at the same time.
[46:45.090 --> 46:45.850]  This is good.
[46:47.610 --> 46:48.110]  What?
[46:49.090 --> 46:49.550]  Wait, what?
[46:50.190 --> 46:52.090]  No, I mean...
[46:52.090 --> 46:54.790]  That looks like it's supposed to be something.
[46:56.330 --> 46:56.950]  Get in the little
[46:56.950 --> 46:57.790]  volcano spout.
[46:58.050 --> 46:58.490]  Oh no!
[46:59.330 --> 46:59.830]  Fuck!
[47:00.050 --> 47:00.550]  Fuck!
[47:03.590 --> 47:06.010]  Andrew was gonna do it, but he can't now.
[47:06.010 --> 47:07.470]  So, uh, blew that.
[47:07.650 --> 47:10.310]  All the satisfaction from the hole went away.
[47:10.550 --> 47:10.910]  Uh-huh.
[47:12.930 --> 47:13.890]  I think I can launch
[47:13.890 --> 47:14.730]  Geoff into it.
[47:15.450 --> 47:17.830]  I mean, it just puts you, like, right there,
[47:17.950 --> 47:20.230]  and then Nick is coming up soon, so let's try it.
[47:21.530 --> 47:22.210]  Oh, full beans.
[47:22.350 --> 47:24.030]  Wow! Oh, did it work?
[47:24.910 --> 47:26.230]  Yeah, it worked.
[47:27.250 --> 47:28.490]  Well, I don't see Geoff anywhere.
[47:28.970 --> 47:29.470]  I don't either.
[47:29.730 --> 47:32.370]  I think that's not necessarily a good thing.
[47:32.390 --> 47:33.190]  Yeah, it worked.
[47:33.770 --> 47:34.930]  There he is, out in space!
[47:35.990 --> 47:36.950]  Yeah, there I go!
[47:41.940 --> 47:44.580]  Gavin not taking any chances, just lined himself up.
[47:45.440 --> 47:46.680]  You can try to make that lip again.
[47:48.060 --> 47:48.540]  I could.
[47:51.860 --> 47:52.260]  Or...
[47:52.260 --> 47:52.820]  Oh!
[47:58.500 --> 48:00.560]  And he lined up for the next one.
[48:00.720 --> 48:01.400]  That was just a good shot.
[48:01.400 --> 48:02.920]  That was incredible.
[48:04.260 --> 48:05.380]  Thank you.
[48:06.320 --> 48:06.640]  Yeah.
[48:08.120 --> 48:09.420]  It was incredible.
[48:13.140 --> 48:15.400]  Too many beans.
[48:16.640 --> 48:17.400]  It was great, though.
[48:21.520 --> 48:22.040]  There you go.
[48:24.380 --> 48:25.240]  Missed!
[48:26.660 --> 48:29.420]  It's timed perfectly, but I just missed.
[48:32.220 --> 48:32.620]  No!
[48:33.620 --> 48:34.400]  Alright, here comes Gavin.
[48:34.960 --> 48:35.700]  Look at him behind that.
[48:35.820 --> 48:37.920]  He punched me in the back of the head and then hid.
[48:38.340 --> 48:39.780]  He's like me in fights.
[48:44.620 --> 48:46.140]  You can go out and around.
[48:46.780 --> 48:49.220]  Oh, you went out.
[48:53.820 --> 48:54.220]  God.
[48:54.700 --> 48:55.360]  Your neck lined up.
[48:55.360 --> 48:55.840]  Easy street.
[48:57.700 --> 48:58.760]  Running away, huh?
[49:00.120 --> 49:00.280]  Nope.
[49:00.820 --> 49:01.280]  Goodbye.
[49:03.040 --> 49:04.140]  I'll see you in the next hole.
[49:04.500 --> 49:05.020]  Yeah, you will.
[49:06.560 --> 49:08.920]  Teenage ennui in that shrug.
[49:09.200 --> 49:09.320]  Alright.
[49:10.760 --> 49:11.820]  Let's do this again.
[49:12.080 --> 49:12.980]  This is good.
[49:14.960 --> 49:15.500]  Good hit.
[49:15.860 --> 49:16.480]  I think that's it.
[49:18.320 --> 49:18.840]  Yes!
[49:18.840 --> 49:19.120]  Yes!
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.680]  Hole in one.
[49:22.180 --> 49:23.140]  Hell yeah.
[49:24.380 --> 49:25.960]  Great job, Geoff.
[49:26.680 --> 49:27.280]  Thank you.
[49:28.740 --> 49:31.440]  I'm like Kevin Costner in Tin Cup.
[49:31.980 --> 49:32.220]  Yeah.
[49:33.140 --> 49:35.200]  You had to go over the lake.
[49:39.110 --> 49:39.290]  What?
[49:40.230 --> 49:41.190]  Over and over again?
[49:41.410 --> 49:43.950]  No, I was looking at Andrew's shot.
[49:46.290 --> 49:48.170]  There it goes.
[49:55.000 --> 49:55.740]  Uh-oh.
[49:58.060 --> 49:59.020]  Come at me, Chum.
[50:00.080 --> 50:02.560]  There's a lot of ammo between you and Gavin.
[50:02.700 --> 50:04.420]  Come at me, you slag.
[50:05.540 --> 50:06.420]  Uh-oh.
[50:08.100 --> 50:09.500]  Oh my God.
[50:10.180 --> 50:10.920]  That's rough.
[50:11.340 --> 50:12.080]  Right in front of me.
[50:13.180 --> 50:14.160]  God damn it.
[50:14.240 --> 50:14.820]  I've got to get out of here.
[50:17.840 --> 50:19.120]  Nice try, though, Andrew.
[50:19.760 --> 50:21.600]  I hit it too early, but thanks.
[50:23.580 --> 50:25.200]  Oh, there it goes.
[50:25.540 --> 50:26.480]  Let's go right up.
[50:28.720 --> 50:29.480]  Not too light.
[50:30.300 --> 50:30.600]  No!
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.020]  The unraveling of Andrew Panton.
[50:37.380 --> 50:38.180]  What's going on?
[50:40.100 --> 50:41.680]  This is going to be a long-ass let's play.
[50:41.780 --> 50:42.140]  I love it.
[50:47.840 --> 50:48.800]  Fucking piece of shit.
[50:49.900 --> 50:52.140]  Piece of fucking garbage.
[50:55.930 --> 50:56.700]  Oh, man.
[50:57.080 --> 50:58.500]  This is going to be hard to come back from this, Andrew.
[50:59.790 --> 51:00.160]  Yeah.
[51:00.520 --> 51:01.440]  Come on!
[51:02.300 --> 51:03.040]  Andrew!
[51:05.950 --> 51:06.320]  Andrew!
[51:08.560 --> 51:10.000]  He's disintegrating.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.620]  I recognize this.
[51:11.620 --> 51:13.360]  Oh my God!
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.620]  He's unraveling like a sweater.
[51:15.940 --> 51:16.940]  Get in the fucking spaceship!
[51:17.740 --> 51:18.940]  You piece of shit!
[51:19.730 --> 51:20.100]  No!
[51:23.780 --> 51:25.220]  God damn!
[51:25.980 --> 51:28.180]  Get in the fucking spaceship!
[51:30.280 --> 51:33.740]  None of that would have happened if you didn't mess with me, I think.
[51:37.700 --> 51:40.280]  The magic of this whole thing
[51:40.280 --> 51:43.240]  is that people listening to this
[51:43.240 --> 51:44.440]  get the edited version.
[51:44.580 --> 51:46.700]  When you end up playing a game with Andrew
[51:46.700 --> 51:48.960]  on Discord, it clips out
[51:48.960 --> 51:50.440]  every time he screams.
[51:50.660 --> 51:52.280]  He was screaming!
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.680]  Yeah, we're hearing totally different things.
[51:58.360 --> 51:58.920]  That was nice.
[51:59.640 --> 52:00.280]  What?
[52:01.120 --> 52:03.580]  Did you end up in his crusher?
[52:03.960 --> 52:05.460]  Yeah, I think you hit the crusher.
[52:06.160 --> 52:07.180]  That was nice.
[52:07.180 --> 52:07.760]  Oops.
[52:10.980 --> 52:12.000]  Well, I mean,
[52:12.910 --> 52:14.240]  certainly that wasn't the plan.
[52:14.700 --> 52:15.580]  Did you even get the power?
[52:16.080 --> 52:16.660]  No.
[52:19.760 --> 52:20.920]  Did you just
[52:20.920 --> 52:21.840]  time it wrong?
[52:22.360 --> 52:24.160]  Oh yeah, I did everything wrong.
[52:30.340 --> 52:32.080]  What's wrong with everyone?
[52:32.080 --> 52:33.420]  I thought it cancelled out.
[52:35.660 --> 52:37.160]  I thought it cancelled out,
[52:37.160 --> 52:38.360]  so I went to hit A and
[52:39.100 --> 52:39.360]  fired.
[52:40.240 --> 52:42.100]  What are you doing?
[52:47.080 --> 52:48.120]  Oh wow.
[52:48.840 --> 52:49.220]  Uh oh.
[52:51.140 --> 52:52.080]  Glue him! Glue him!
[52:55.300 --> 52:57.380]  You glued all over yourself.
[52:58.260 --> 52:59.760]  I can clear that.
[52:59.960 --> 53:01.940]  I don't like that you can't choose the power.
[53:03.060 --> 53:03.820]  Spark me!
[53:07.160 --> 53:14.780]  This video is going to be so long.
[53:15.200 --> 53:17.460]  This is going to be so long.
[53:17.680 --> 53:19.200]  I was so excited
[53:19.200 --> 53:20.760]  to get jetted ahead by the spark,
[53:20.820 --> 53:22.660]  so I couldn't think of how to describe it.
[53:24.060 --> 53:25.020]  Spark me.
[53:28.160 --> 53:29.120]  That's a miss.
[53:30.800 --> 53:32.980]  You prick. You fucking prick.
[53:33.200 --> 53:35.040]  Did you drop the glue on the ground?
[53:35.040 --> 53:35.340]  Did you drop the glue?
[53:40.420 --> 53:42.460]  It felt so good to knock him off.
[53:42.580 --> 53:43.340]  He just got everywhere.
[53:43.840 --> 53:44.660]  He pre-combed.
[53:45.480 --> 53:46.840]  No, stop going back there!
[54:01.240 --> 54:03.480]  Oh wow!
[54:04.560 --> 54:05.680]  What a play.
[54:06.240 --> 54:08.420]  Did you come out somewhere?
[54:09.020 --> 54:10.160]  What? No.
[54:12.360 --> 54:14.300]  You just got crushed.
[54:14.300 --> 54:15.360]  What do you mean?
[54:15.420 --> 54:16.720]  What do you mean?
[54:16.800 --> 54:18.800]  What happened to him?
[54:19.140 --> 54:22.640]  He's on the course a few feet from the crusher.
[54:22.720 --> 54:22.960]  He didn't get crushed.
[54:22.960 --> 54:24.160]  I just saw him die.
[54:24.500 --> 54:25.860]  He died on my screen.
[54:27.900 --> 54:29.280]  He's set up really well.
[54:29.880 --> 54:30.420]  Yeah, I'm good.
[54:31.440 --> 54:32.560]  Son of a bitch.
[54:32.780 --> 54:34.000]  This game is lying to us now.
[54:34.580 --> 54:35.580]  Look at the chat.
[54:41.840 --> 54:44.300]  Nick, I'm excited for your turn to happen.
[54:44.420 --> 54:45.120]  And you are back here.
[54:45.600 --> 54:46.240]  Yeah, me too.
[54:47.560 --> 54:49.280]  How did I not get anything?
[54:51.700 --> 54:53.220]  Where did your ball go?
[54:53.540 --> 54:54.180]  It got crushed.
[54:54.680 --> 54:56.180]  That's what happened to Nick for us.
[54:56.560 --> 54:57.500]  Oh no, I'm good.
[54:57.500 --> 54:58.420]  Oh, what?
[55:01.760 --> 55:03.340]  Where are you?
[55:03.640 --> 55:09.680]  I'm to the right of where Gavin crashed.
[55:09.900 --> 55:11.600]  Do I want to get crushed?
[55:12.360 --> 55:13.880]  Here's where Nick's lined up.
[55:14.620 --> 55:15.800]  On our screen.
[55:16.320 --> 55:17.740]  Nick is in the crusher.
[55:17.920 --> 55:18.680]  What are you doing?
[55:19.560 --> 55:21.600]  Wait, he's not in the crusher.
[55:21.600 --> 55:23.180]  Oh no, I'm achy.
[55:25.500 --> 55:28.880]  You guys have to re-watch his perspective on this.
[55:29.080 --> 55:30.620]  You need to see ours.
[55:30.840 --> 55:32.420]  That was absolutely insane.
[55:32.620 --> 55:34.660]  The editor will have to play both side by side with it.
[55:34.740 --> 55:36.060]  Because that was completely random.
[55:36.180 --> 55:37.480]  I'm going to get crushed though.
[55:38.880 --> 55:40.160]  How did I get oopsed?
[55:40.560 --> 55:41.300]  You got smashed.
[55:41.820 --> 55:44.840]  But everybody else that gets smashed goes to fucking...
[55:44.840 --> 55:45.520]  I see.
[55:46.360 --> 55:49.940]  Andrew, where you were lined up is like where Nick was.
[55:50.080 --> 55:50.300]  Almost.
[55:50.300 --> 55:52.160]  Yeah, kind of.
[55:52.500 --> 55:53.520]  Who's this by the way?
[55:53.720 --> 55:54.320]  That's me.
[55:57.040 --> 55:57.820]  It's Geoff.
[55:57.880 --> 55:58.860]  He's been trapped there.
[56:00.060 --> 56:02.380]  I swear that crusher sucks you up, right?
[56:02.900 --> 56:03.540]  What the fuck?
[56:04.060 --> 56:04.220]  What?
[56:15.760 --> 56:17.720]  So Nick was never crushed?
[56:17.720 --> 56:19.120]  Or this is where Nick was last time?
[56:19.120 --> 56:20.820]  No, this is where Nick was last time.
[56:20.840 --> 56:22.280]  But he never got crushed.
[56:24.200 --> 56:27.760]  Yeah, at the end of his last pull, he got crushed.
[56:28.340 --> 56:29.680]  It just happened to be coincidental.
[56:30.340 --> 56:33.120]  Yes, but it sent me back to where I was.
[56:35.580 --> 56:36.940]  Join me, I'll join you.
[56:43.860 --> 56:45.560]  Get me out of here!
[56:46.440 --> 56:49.280]  I want to go home!
[56:58.800 --> 57:04.640]  Why do I keep doing the same thing?
[57:06.520 --> 57:09.100]  I know what I must do.
[57:10.840 --> 57:11.260]  No!
[57:11.960 --> 57:13.120]  Did you miss completely?
[57:13.660 --> 57:15.560]  Did you miss?
[57:15.680 --> 57:16.020]  What?
[57:16.540 --> 57:18.880]  I was trying to go behind him to launch him the other way.
[57:19.560 --> 57:20.840]  You didn't touch him.
[57:21.360 --> 57:22.880]  Nope, sure didn't.
[57:23.440 --> 57:23.680]  Huh.
[57:24.280 --> 57:25.740]  Get the fuck over there.
[57:29.480 --> 57:30.900]  Now you're lined up.
[57:31.260 --> 57:32.600]  Just fighting the environment.
[57:34.540 --> 57:35.060]  Okay.
[57:36.840 --> 57:37.580]  There we go.
[57:37.880 --> 57:38.520]  Double bogey.
[57:38.520 --> 57:39.000]  Wow.
[57:41.000 --> 57:41.580]  Huh.
[57:42.440 --> 57:43.540]  Can't believe I missed him.
[57:49.960 --> 57:51.000]  That's impossible.
[57:51.280 --> 57:51.860]  Oh, you're alive!
[57:53.060 --> 57:53.860]  Don't blow!
[57:55.500 --> 57:56.660]  You're fine.
[57:57.020 --> 57:57.480]  Am I good?
[57:58.320 --> 57:58.940]  You're good.
[57:59.620 --> 57:59.900]  Yay!
[58:05.560 --> 58:07.320]  Can I have a plus three?
[58:07.780 --> 58:08.700]  Geoff, come back for me.
[58:10.480 --> 58:11.460]  You know I won't.
[58:11.460 --> 58:12.960]  Light it up.
[58:14.580 --> 58:15.100]  You...
[58:16.520 --> 58:17.360]  fucking... suck.
[58:20.640 --> 58:21.540]  That's not in the right way.
[58:21.840 --> 58:22.320]  Yeah, I know.
[58:23.740 --> 58:24.720]  Point it at the hole.
[58:29.490 --> 58:30.010]  Cool.
[58:39.300 --> 58:40.200]  Fuck you.
[58:40.400 --> 58:43.000]  That plus eight isn't looking so bad right now.
[58:43.300 --> 58:43.660]  Uh-uh.
[58:47.760 --> 58:49.160]  Oh, fuck off.
[58:49.160 --> 58:49.780]  Wow!
[58:51.060 --> 58:52.540]  Oh, shit. Uh-oh.
[58:53.940 --> 58:55.060]  Piece of shit.
[58:58.940 --> 59:00.740]  My plus eight isn't feeling bad.
[59:01.700 --> 59:02.440]  Uh-oh.
[59:03.080 --> 59:03.900]  Oh, look at this.
[59:05.100 --> 59:05.840]  Uh-oh.
[59:06.300 --> 59:07.660]  There's a Robby the Robot down there.
[59:09.200 --> 59:09.980]  Uh-oh.
[59:10.160 --> 59:11.680]  Where do we...
[59:11.680 --> 59:13.660]  go from here?
[59:19.270 --> 59:20.670]  If Nick was a robot,
[59:20.670 --> 59:22.950]  what would we call him?
[59:23.230 --> 59:24.130]  Oh, interesting.
[59:28.210 --> 59:28.870]  Regulatrion.
[59:29.390 --> 59:29.530]  What?
[59:31.210 --> 59:32.590]  Gotta agree with that.
[59:34.890 --> 59:36.370]  There is a correct answer.
[59:36.890 --> 59:37.450]  Oh, yeah?
[59:38.130 --> 59:39.630]  And what is that?
[59:42.450 --> 59:43.710]  Robot Nick.
[59:44.390 --> 59:44.830]  Yay!
[59:45.870 --> 59:47.150]  He's not a doctor.
[59:47.670 --> 59:48.130]  Yeah.
[59:49.790 --> 59:51.590]  I'm a doctor like Dr. Pepper is a doctor.
[59:52.110 --> 59:53.570]  What if Nick was a doctor
[59:53.570 --> 59:54.630]  and he just never mentioned it?
[59:56.270 --> 59:57.230]  Huh. Dr. Nick.
[59:58.110 --> 59:58.350]  Yeah.
[59:58.990 --> 59:59.930]  Like in The Simpsons.
[01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:01.170]  Hi, everybody!
[01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:05.850]  Dr. Nick?
[01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:09.030]  Oh, they're the same hole.
[01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.090]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:13.330]  Golf balls are shooting
[01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:14.070]  cum everywhere.
[01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.590]  Need to clean lab.
[01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.170]  Running around.
[01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:29.890]  You see that?
[01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:32.210]  You see that robot
[01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:33.450]  in the background on the computer?
[01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:36.150]  That's as many keys as I know how to use.
[01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:37.330]  That's me.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.870]  I got one button down.
[01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.490]  Caps lock.
[01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:41.930]  Caps lock.
[01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:42.790]  Okay.
[01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.010]  That's not the final hole, right?
[01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.270]  What is a left trigger?
[01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:53.530]  Oh, Christ.
[01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.070]  How do I...
[01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.250]  Oh, it's not.
[01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:00.650]  Let's get in the hole.
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.710]  Ball in my way.
[01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:05.510]  Bullshit dickhead ball in my way.
[01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:06.370]  Let's get in the hole.
[01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:06.470]  Let's get in the hole.
[01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:14.430]  Don't be kicking all our balls.
[01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.990]  Man, I fucking hate this.
[01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.290]  Fuck!
[01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.370]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:28.070]  This whole fucking course.
[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.730]  Hey, buddy.
[01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:29.650]  What's up, man?
[01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:33.190]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:40.720]  Wow!
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.020]  Shit!
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.560]  It's been fun, fellas.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.260]  Son of a bitch!
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.140]  Gavin!
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.300]  Oh, wow.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:50.840]  It's not even the end.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.040]  Damn.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.260]  There's more to go.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:56.720]  Alright.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.620]  Thread the needle.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:00.480]  Yeah.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.940]  There's a back right hole.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.460]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.600]  Oh, wow!
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.640]  What a shot!
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:10.620]  Oh, wait.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.020]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.720]  Why did you listen to Nick?
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.540]  Are you fucking serious right now?
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.080]  That's a bad hole.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.440]  Stay away from that hole.
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.620]  I don't think you want to go in that one.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:24.880]  What?
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.620]  It's a setup shot.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.460]  I'm setting up for the good one.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.560]  Gavin, you know what a setup shot is.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.060]  Oops.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.700]  You suck.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.540]  You could have done
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.640]  two things there and you didn't do either one.
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.380]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.440]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.920]  Oh, Christ.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.680]  I have some room to play, I think.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.800]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.220]  I feel like everyone could have done several things
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.300]  and they're not doing any of them.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.240]  That was
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.900]  almost yellow
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.460]  and it still didn't make it up that hill.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.740]  Nice shot!
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.760]  Setup shot!
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.560]  This all sucks.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.440]  Space is tough, man.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.980]  Every Dove game has a space map
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.260]  and it sucks.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:27.900]  Nice!
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.920]  You know what they say, in space
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.560]  no one can hear you bogey.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.160]  Yeah, but they hear you scream all the time now.
[01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:39.010]  Alright, you can do this.
[01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:42.410]  Maybe not. Nope.
[01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:43.170]  Par.
[01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:54.950]  This better go somewhere good.
[01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:57.250]  I went somewhere.
[01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:58.350]  You can bomb.
[01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:01.670]  He's already doing that.
[01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:05.650]  No!
[01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:08.030]  Holy shit, what was that?
[01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.710]  It's all crunkled up.
[01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.830]  Yeah, it's crunkled.
[01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:14.490]  There's something wrong with this course, Geoff.
[01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:15.230]  It's all crunkled.
[01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:16.950]  It's all McCorkled.
[01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:24.270]  Hello?
[01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:25.310]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.750]  There's a bomb right there. You can grab it.
[01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:30.690]  It's already on fire.
[01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:32.730]  I don't think you're gonna...
[01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:33.470]  He does have fire.
[01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:35.290]  Aimed a little bit at me there, Geoff.
[01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:37.590]  Is it?
[01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:39.690]  It will make you go right on the lip.
[01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:41.410]  It's all ridgy.
[01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:42.130]  There's a couple of lips.
[01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:44.590]  It's McCrunkled.
[01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:47.030]  It's crunkled up there. Be careful. Fire!
[01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:49.210]  Holy shit.
[01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:50.310]  There's a gap.
[01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:52.890]  Why is there a fucking gap?
[01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:54.130]  For you, not for me.
[01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:56.750]  That's a tight gap.
[01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:57.990]  Uh-oh.
[01:04:59.010 --> 01:04:59.410]  No!
[01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:00.870]  Damn it.
[01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:05.050]  I didn't think you had it,
[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:05.350]  at first.
[01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:07.290]  I didn't think I had it.
[01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.910]  You got this.
[01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:12.170]  Well, I think I know how this is gonna play.
[01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:13.350]  Are you gonna help me out? That's cool.
[01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:17.490]  Oh, that helped me over the...
[01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.010]  Oh, he's going back!
[01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:20.790]  He's going back!
[01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:30.710]  What do you mean?
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:46.470]  I didn't know you could do that.
[01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:47.230]  Am I in the tube?
[01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:48.970]  For God's sake.
[01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:52.630]  Gavin has advanced
[01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:54.950]  comedy techniques I've never seen before.
[01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.450]  He didn't even know they were there.
[01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:58.850]  Oh, nice shot.
[01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:59.430]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.250]  How come you just didn't do all this earlier?
[01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:03.010]  How is this happening?
[01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:05.490]  I've got practice now.
[01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.590]  Where the frickin' hell was that suck hole?
[01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:12.190]  Since when can you go back up?
[01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:14.030]  No!
[01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:24.690]  Wait, your thumbstick fell off?
[01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:25.930]  What did you do?
[01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.610]  Wait, did I go? I was under my desk.
[01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:29.090]  What did I do?
[01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:29.710]  You went!
[01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.450]  All my paddles flew off.
[01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:36.090]  What did I do?
[01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:37.950]  You hit it two inches.
[01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.810]  Where's the thumbstick?
[01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:48.550]  Moron!
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.320]  Plus eight!
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.720]  God damn it!
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.500]  Oh!
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.400]  Oh, shit!
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.720]  I'm too hot now, I'm sweating.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.060]  It's so hot in here.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.600]  When you got sucked up that tube,
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.740]  it was like a revelation.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.540]  It was so special.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.100]  Oh, man.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.500]  Was that a shot?
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:24.440]  What happened?
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.440]  I took a shot.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.620]  Oh, no!
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.460]  The game is broken.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.260]  I think the game is broken.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.820]  This game is well made.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.760]  Is it going to show you my shot?
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:44.820]  Oh, it did.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.520]  Looks like that one was shown.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.140]  It's out of bounds.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.280]  Uh, yeah.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560]  You just got to want it.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.060]  And I do.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.940]  Oh, it's out.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.700]  Too much want.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.900]  Maybe the most out of bounds
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.120]  you could possibly have.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.100]  Oh, wow.
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.180]  What a move.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.520]  That's a good move.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.340]  Better than us.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.340]  Be careful, though.
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.320]  It's a little scrunkled.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.000]  Oh, is it McCorkled over there?
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:26.380]  Uh-huh.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.720]  Oh, nice.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.200]  Oh, wow.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:33.820]  No!
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.040]  Oh, dear.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.720]  I can't believe you got sucked back up.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.480]  Alright, you got this, Andrew, Gavin.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.100]  Okay.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.380]  Did you call him Andrew, Gavin?
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:48.960]  Yeah, I did.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:49.920]  I didn't know who it was.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.000]  What?
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.140]  What?
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.520]  Oh, that's somewhere.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:56.800]  There you go.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:57.860]  It's about as good as I did.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.940]  Except you picked up nothing.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.500]  Big ol' bagel.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.060]  Donut.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.580]  I'd love a bagel right now.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.540]  Oh, that sounds good.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.580]  How do I wanna...
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.120]  I had tacos for breakfast.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:13.340]  There we go.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:14.600]  Fuck!
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:15.740]  I did it again!
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:16.700]  There we go.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:17.900]  Ah!
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.740]  Oh, now the door closes.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.120]  Excellent.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.780]  I wonder if I could just go
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.500]  up and over, huh?
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.400]  I like it.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.000]  Oh!
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.360]  That was really good.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.040]  That was way better than I thought.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.960]  Stay the fuck away from me.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:37.980]  Get away from me.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.120]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.000]  Get away.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:42.080]  Get away.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:48.640]  Okay.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.320]  Uh-oh.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.340]  Light it up!
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.500]  I hate this fucking set of levels so much.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.720]  Oh my God.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.200]  That is nonsense.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.620]  Are these all the DLC levels?
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.760]  No, we still haven't made it to the DLC.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:03.720]  Holy shit.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.000]  This might be impossible from here.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:08.960]  No, you got it.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.840]  Nah, nothing's impossible.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.160]  No.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.140]  Yeah, do it like I did.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:15.620]  Look at that.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:15.960]  Perfect.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:20.700]  It's a deceptive spot. Be careful.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.000]  There's a guy with a bomb over there.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.020]  Full balls!
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.300]  Nick's still at the start.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.440]  Can't do full.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:32.960]  Door's closed.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:35.500]  Oh, wow.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.100]  Come back down.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.020]  No!
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:39.740]  Okay.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:40.740]  You're good.
[01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:55.970]  Nice shot.
[01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:57.110]  Close.
[01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.930]  Too much.
[01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:00.510]  Too much.
[01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:03.010]  Doesn't take much.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.060]  Huh.
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:12.380]  Splooge.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:14.220]  Knock.
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:18.520]  That was useless.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.840]  Absolutely useless.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.640]  He just mirrored
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.960]  exactly where you were. That's fun.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.660]  He's got a better shot at the hill now.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:28.840]  Yeah, he's full of
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.340]  black cum now, too.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.060]  Oh, wow.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.280]  Oh, wow.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:37.820]  Shit.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.080]  The bat.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.060]  That's what I did.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.120]  Can I...
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.280]  You got this, Nick.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.420]  Full power probably from that.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.560]  You made me very nervous.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:53.600]  And...
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:54.660]  Nick.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.040]  Gotta look on your aim.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.500]  Yup, yup, yup.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.340]  This is so different from the first game.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.100]  For you?
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.000]  Are you
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.040]  fucking serious right now?
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.040]  Are you fucking serious?
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.080]  Oh, it's out.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.040]  I hit it one pubic hair less than last time.
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:17.860]  Okay.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.560]  We're just gonna get up.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:20.480]  We're just getting up.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.400]  Stay up.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:25.440]  Stay up.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.680]  Oh. Nice.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.780]  How is this lawn
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.900]  so glidey?
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:33.940]  Space.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:34.880]  Robots.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.060]  As a graphs guy, I thought you'd know that.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:40.620]  Oh.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:42.280]  Oh.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.640]  A little kisser.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.760]  You got this, Nick.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.220]  Just remember about beans and the appropriate amount.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.680]  Oh, boy. Nice.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.340]  Let me see if I can join the party.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.920]  May have stuck my neck out.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.540]  A little bit more than that.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.360]  I'm so glad you didn't.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.360]  I want the bomb guy far away from us.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.060]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.000]  Imagine a bomb in the middle of all that.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:17.720]  Yeah.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.840]  Get me out of this hellscape.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:21.620]  Do it, Andrew.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.160]  Slick it.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.300]  Way too far.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.860]  Were you trying to oil and then go in?
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.120]  I don't know what I was doing.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:32.940]  Unclutch my pearls.
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:33.960]  They call that inking.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:35.600]  Oh.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.080]  Oh, my God.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.280]  You know what?
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.600]  That might be the meanest thing I've ever seen.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.980]  It took so long to get up there.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:45.860]  I had that coming.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.100]  Did you?
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.040]  There might be more coming, too.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.660]  Fuck! You missed!
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.800]  I thought the radius was much bigger.
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.340]  Just go through it.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.900]  Just go through the middle.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.000]  So much ready can see straight.
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.040]  You know what?
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.480]  We need to get on top of health care.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.040]  How did you do that?
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:10.820]  Do it.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.660]  Oh, shit.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:15.760]  There's a fuse.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:16.840]  How big that?
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.360]  Not that.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.100]  Shot my wad over there.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.640]  This is it, Andrew. You got it.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.700]  You got this. Easy peasy.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:28.700]  Why are you going?
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.980]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.240]  That's rough.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.140]  Where are you going?
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:40.660]  You can probably knock him out.
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:42.900]  Straight in.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.720]  Where are you going, Gavin?
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.740]  Oh, shit. I was hoping to go in.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.880]  Yeah, that would have been pretty cool.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.680]  Yeah, that would have been really cool.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.320]  Expose now.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.440]  I was saying, why did you go? I thought you were going to turn and hit me.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.480]  No.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.500]  I just want to end this.
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.880]  You piece of shit.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:02.640]  You got him in the hole.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.360]  Wait, what happened?
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.860]  It's a blowhole.
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:07.840]  It's blowing.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.080]  I'm down here now.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:15.720]  Goddamn.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.620]  It doesn't even show you.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.260]  You just spawned yourself in the sea of shit.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.200]  Are you fucking kidding?
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.840]  I accept your apology.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.800]  This is never going to end.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.420]  Why are you hitting me? I'm fucking losing like a motherfucker.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.280]  Do it.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.840]  I didn't do shit to you.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.060]  I'm so falling apart.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.500]  I fucking hate you.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:45.420]  There's nothing more venomous than a gentle tap out of there.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.200]  I hate you. I'm sorry, Geoff.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.160]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.280]  Are you kidding me?
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.400]  I didn't think I'd be able to do that for that.
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.360]  What is that?
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.040]  This is the best.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.120]  I'm losing my mind.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.300]  How many holes are left?
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.200]  I'm out too much.
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:13.720]  This is mini-golf the movie.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.260]  Oh my god.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.000]  Oh, this video is crazy.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.840]  Oh, fuck me, dude.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.120]  Oh my god.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.220]  Well, let's see what happens here.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.260]  Where did he go?
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.320]  Where did he go?
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.080]  Where am I?
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:37.860]  Oh, god.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.640]  How far back did I go?
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.020]  You must not be out of bounds yet.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:43.840]  You must be somewhere.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.080]  I'm still flying.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.240]  There he is.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.140]  What is that thing?
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.460]  I'm on the other side of where you are.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.940]  How did you get over here?
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.020]  I don't know.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.460]  That's installation 04.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.360]  I want the power up.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.180]  I hope the covenant glass this place.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.320]  Is that shield worth it?
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.480]  Oh, shield and oil.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:15.400]  Nice.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.280]  Oh.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:19.800]  Oh.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.180]  Remember when we thought I was out of it?
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.380]  Because I got a plus 8 on that first one.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.260]  Little did we know.
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.020]  Keep going.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:30.980]  No way.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:35.680]  Come on, Nick.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.560]  That's not even...
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:41.180]  What are you doing?
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:42.520]  I...
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.200]  Nick has lost his mind.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.920]  I think today broke Nick.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.440]  Is there a max stroke count?
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.520]  That's not hard enough.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.580]  That's not hard enough at all.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:56.980]  The whole time.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.200]  The whole level you've been doing this.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.500]  It was in the yellow.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.720]  I hate this level.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.960]  Last time I did yellow, I flew over the damn thing.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.140]  Hold to the left, Andrew.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.480]  Bit left of that.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.260]  A little bit left.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.640]  Maybe like 15 degrees left.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.540]  He didn't even oil me.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:28.700]  He didn't do anything.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.140]  Oh, put me home.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.720]  You didn't.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:33.820]  Gavin.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.180]  Oh, I panicked.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.040]  Get him!
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.540]  Damn it!
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.440]  Look at all this greed happening.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.140]  Oh, man.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.380]  Here we go. This is going to be the shot.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.200]  Oh, this is the same level with the little turny tables?
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:55.720]  Yes!
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.300]  Oh, shit.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.700]  Geoff, that was too hard.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.360]  There's no middle ground, Eric.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.360]  It's too much or too little.
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:11.880]  Always.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.020]  It is so persnickety.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.980]  Hit the blow.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.400]  I'm not even close enough to get hit by that.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.080]  Yeah, but doesn't it last through this turn?
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:22.760]  Yeah.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.080]  Wait, does it?
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.520]  It'll last until he goes again, I think.
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.500]  Activated the blowhole.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.480]  I think it just turns off now.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.840]  I guess we'll see.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:38.760]  Stay on.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.840]  Now!
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.720]  Oh, what a...
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.420]  Get me the hell out of here.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.700]  That's up to you.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.220]  A cheeky bit of...
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.760]  Finally, someone.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.140]  You're fucked.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:00.580]  You're super fucked.
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.700]  No way.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.580]  Wow, Nick.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.060]  Caused all over the thing.
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.300]  No!
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.780]  I got...
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.580]  I got the oil slick, too.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.700]  What is with some of these taps?
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:31.380]  At least I got it up the hill.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.300]  What hole is this?
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.980]  Oh, I have no idea.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.140]  Yeah, is this the last one?
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:37.780]  No.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:39.660]  Fuck.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.980]  Oh my God, this is hell on Earth.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.460]  There has to be a stroke here.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.660]  There has to be.
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.200]  I think it's 14.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:51.940]  You got this, Nick.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:52.680]  Lock it in.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.000]  No!
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.460]  You gotta aim, dude.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:20:59.720]  What's with your aim?
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.500]  That's such an easy tap there, now.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:03.800]  Just tap him off.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.000]  He's right there.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:06.700]  Tap him off.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.900]  Yeah, Geoff!
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.840]  Geoff wants to be done so bad.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.880]  Just with that hole.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.500]  What will Andrew aim at?
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.360]  I tried to help you.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.400]  Okay, try.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.420]  Oh my God.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.680]  Get back up there.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.560]  What does oil do?
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.660]  Does it make you go slippery?
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:38.180]  It's like an oil slick in Spy Hunter.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.540]  What? Are we ever gonna find out?
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.820]  We'll never learn.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.540]  Are you for real?
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.020]  I'd like that to be.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.160]  He can do it again, though.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.540]  I'd like that to be.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:54.480]  Yeah!
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.740]  He spaffed on his back.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:01.920]  He just missed.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.080]  Oh, Christ.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.600]  I can't fucking take it.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.780]  It's so fucking stupid.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.420]  Thank God.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.520]  Ah, alright.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:12.740]  Plus ten, Andrew.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.820]  This might be Andrew's last shot here.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.100]  What just happened?
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.400]  What was that?
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:21.940]  What's wrong with you?
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:24.200]  Oh my God, it's still going.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.660]  I'm broken.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.380]  Get on the hill.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:32.300]  What are you doing?
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.580]  I just want up there.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:38.280]  I just want to get up there.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.960]  I just want to be up there.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.480]  I just want to be up there.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.040]  That's not hard enough.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:50.100]  I just want to be up there.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.880]  It's not 14.
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:54.320]  Just let me up on the flat part.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:55.380]  There we go.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.120]  Go, go, go, go.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.340]  Just get me in the hole.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.920]  You're a big shot.
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.020]  They're all holes.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.340]  Andrew's hit plus 32.
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.520]  He almost doubled his score on one hole.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.580]  We've done this one before.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.760]  This video is crazy.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.380]  How did we do this one before?
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.660]  We did an extra hole on the first
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.200]  let's play, I think.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.580]  I just picked this one at random.
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.600]  I've never been so sweaty.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.240]  Is everyone getting the red ether icon?
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.020]  Every so often.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:51.240]  Yeah.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.500]  Games breaking down.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:54.980]  Whoa!
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.840]  You're going to get cum on the ceiling.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.920]  Is that a Lionel Richie song?
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.860]  It's from his first album.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:06.580]  Lionel Richie.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:07.820]  Oh, what a feeling.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.800]  Talk about all night long.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.700]  Refers to the cleaning process.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.960]  Wasn't this the one where the better hole was to the side?
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.420]  Yeah, it was.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.120]  That's why I'm beansin' to the left.
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:24.120]  Yeah?
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:25.860]  Uh-oh.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:27.920]  Beansin' to the left.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:28.580]  Whoa.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:33.620]  It worked!
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:35.400]  Wow.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:37.380]  Go!
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:38.980]  Oh!
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:41.720]  What a tease.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.300]  Yeah, I don't want that, do I?
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.260]  No, you don't.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.880]  I don't know if you want that either.
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:54.820]  Oh.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.080]  What one do I want?
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.360]  Wow, I'm in space.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.880]  Yeah, careful.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.100]  Don't take a step back.
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:07.800]  Oh, shit.
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:09.300]  Bonk.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.280]  Alright, well, I
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.100]  definitely don't want to go that way,
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:13.880]  so I'm gonna go over here.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.920]  That's definitely the way with the coolest power-up.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.760]  I think we're all exhausted after that last hole.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:28.980]  Oh, my God.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.320]  I feel fucking crazy.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:32.760]  I feel crazy.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:33.440]  Do you?
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:34.740]  I feel like I ran a marathon.
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.580]  Yeah, seriously.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:36.860]  No!
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.120]  Oh, no.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.580]  Oh, no.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.960]  Alright, Gav, here you go.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.100]  Easy peasy.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:52.540]  Where's that?
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.300]  God damn it.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.200]  I could be pulling this out.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.820]  This could be coming back my way.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:01.680]  That means I'm a bad one.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.880]  Not too hard, Nick.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:06.800]  Nice, Nick.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:07.960]  Nice, Nick.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:08.340]  Good shot.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.080]  Oh, boy.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.820]  Is this gonna put me someplace really bad?
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.540]  Nah, you'll be up the hill.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:17.100]  Probably should just go across to Gavin's spot.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.280]  Ah, okay.
[01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:28.830]  I'd rather do that.
[01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:37.730]  What happened there?
[01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:39.730]  Hit the ceiling, I think.
[01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:41.650]  You're trying to blow me up, you little son of a gun.
[01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:44.250]  Pfft.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.080]  You self-defeated before you went in.
[01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:51.820]  Yeah.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.360]  Just on the off chance it blows up in the hole.
[01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:01.550]  You got this.
[01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:02.750]  You got this.
[01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:05.190]  That's it.
[01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.970]  Walk in.
[01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:08.330]  Look at that.
[01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:10.190]  Shit.
[01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:15.310]  It's all Andrew.
[01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:17.570]  Everybody watching Andrew.
[01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:18.310]  In the hole.
[01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:20.970]  Trick shot in the hole.
[01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:22.490]  Roll right back in.
[01:27:23.130 --> 01:27:24.310]  Trick shot in the hole.
[01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:25.430]  Here it is.
[01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:28.150]  Too many beans.
[01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.550]  That's fine.
[01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:32.370]  Here we go.
[01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:34.030]  In you go.
[01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:35.570]  Nice.
[01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:38.030]  Two left.
[01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:42.890]  Close.
[01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:45.850]  It is close.
[01:27:46.050 --> 01:27:46.410]  It is close.
[01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:48.270]  Nick needs to be annihilated.
[01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.650]  What?
[01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:52.050]  Just tell him that you need help.
[01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:52.810]  He'll do it himself.
[01:27:55.410 --> 01:27:56.490]  Everybody dogpile on Nick.
[01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:58.930]  Where do I go?
[01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:01.090]  Point it at the hole.
[01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:03.010]  That's where the secret hole in one is.
[01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.530]  Yeah.
[01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:05.110]  If you get the sign, you get a par three.
[01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.910]  Oh, I see.
[01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:10.290]  I'm an idiot.
[01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:10.790]  That's weird.
[01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:13.290]  Why did you do that?
[01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:15.190]  Because I suck!
[01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:18.030]  Oh, okay.
[01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:22.030]  Nick needs to be annihilated, right?
[01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.750]  Yeah.
[01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:26.750]  Gavin asked for help, and I helped him.
[01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:30.050]  How am I going to do this?
[01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:35.850]  I guess we'll just see what happens if I do this.
[01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:42.930]  Do what?
[01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:46.130]  I like it, Geoff!
[01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.990]  I just missed it.
[01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:47.750]  It was good, though.
[01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:54.010]  I think the secret hole in one is in here.
[01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:55.010]  Okay.
[01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:57.710]  Godspeed. Good luck.
[01:28:58.850 --> 01:28:59.330]  It's not.
[01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:01.850]  That's not where I wanted to go, but...
[01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:02.990]  Sure.
[01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.650]  Uh-oh.
[01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:06.470]  Hey, buddy.
[01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.950]  What's up, man?
[01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:14.330]  Huh.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.860]  Nick, I need help.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.500]  What are you doing?
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.200]  I'm like a sleeper cell.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:33.760]  I was activated.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.660]  Whee! I'm free!
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.200]  That's nice.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:39.700]  And I shielded myself.
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:41.580]  That's smart.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.580]  It's dangerous out here.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.720]  Sorry, the devil on my shoulder was talking, too.
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.920]  Uh, right. There we go.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.060]  Right back where I started.
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:02.940]  Right.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.400]  Andrew, I need help.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:07.960]  Oh, you need some help?
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:08.900]  He's not me.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.080]  I got you.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:15.820]  Where are you at?
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.100]  Okay, there we go.
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.840]  What the fuck?
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840]  What's happening?
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:24.900]  No!
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.300]  Is there a secret hole-in-one back here, Andrew?
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:31.200]  No.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.420]  Uh-oh.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.100]  Where are you going?
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:40.980]  Going for that secret hole-in-one.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:42.380]  Oh!
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:43.780]  Wow!
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.140]  What a play, Geoff.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.000]  Damn it.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.380]  That was pretty good, Geoff.
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:51.840]  Why did I think that was Geoff?
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:58.300]  Since that hole where Andrew went plus 20,
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.220]  I feel like a brain freeze.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.480]  Oh! What happened?
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.840]  Oh, I got infected!
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:04.860]  Oh, is that like a timing thing?
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.060]  Like if it's timed over the right ramp?
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:08.620]  Nick got probed.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.540]  Oh, yeah, it's where the light is.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.460]  My watch stopped.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.380]  Oh, no.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.180]  Where'd the light go?
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.220]  Why did that happen?
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.560]  That wasn't your fault, I don't think.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.860]  Do it. Do it.
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.560]  You know you want to do it.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.660]  If you're going to do it to anybody,
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.920]  do it to Nick. He's the one winning.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:34.700]  Is this Nick?
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.960]  Yeah, that's me. That's Nick.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:37.700]  That's him.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.940]  No, Geoff's the 8-ball, apparently.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.520]  Where did you know that?
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:49.560]  I have an idea.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:51.080]  Okay, I love it.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.040]  I'm for it.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:56.560]  Fuck!
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.640]  Love it, dude.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:59.900]  I like the creativity.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:01.260]  Yeah, same.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.460]  Alright, let's go, Geoff. Put it in the hole.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:05.780]  Here I go.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:07.680]  What you doing there?
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.900]  I'm about to do it!
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:09.780]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:12.600]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.240]  Ha ha ha!
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:18.040]  Miss.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.540]  Yeah!
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.740]  Son of the...
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.080]  Yeah.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.020]  Ooh.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.840]  You could hit me, son.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.900]  I ducked his ass, Nick.
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:30.600]  Ooh.
[01:32:33.650 --> 01:32:35.610]  Just walk over there and kick his ball.
[01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:38.370]  No skill or anything
[01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:39.250]  involved, just kick it.
[01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:42.350]  Were you going full pinch
[01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:43.930]  to the wing and back?
[01:32:44.190 --> 01:32:45.410]  What are you doing?
[01:32:46.230 --> 01:32:48.070]  He's getting weaponry.
[01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:50.570]  Good try, Nick.
[01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:53.030]  For a failed attempt.
[01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.210]  Damn.
[01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.170]  Oh!
[01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:56.650]  You shook him a little bit.
[01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:58.250]  Oh, it did?
[01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:00.950]  Oh, you are off a little bit.
[01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:04.410]  Geoff's gonna put a
[01:33:04.410 --> 01:33:05.610]  nail in your coffin right here.
[01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:06.550]  Oh!
[01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:09.210]  Boom, baby!
[01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:10.050]  Yeah!
[01:33:11.490 --> 01:33:13.090]  What kind of bullshit abduction
[01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:14.990]  was mine? Hole in one.
[01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:16.490]  Huh.
[01:33:17.010 --> 01:33:18.790]  How am I still here?
[01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:21.090]  My abduction was a hole in one, I think
[01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:22.590]  that your abduction was a hole in you.
[01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.590]  Yeah.
[01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:27.170]  You took control of the
[01:33:27.170 --> 01:33:27.830]  ship, I did not.
[01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:29.770]  Pick me up!
[01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:32.970]  Got that shield power up.
[01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.930]  Wow!
[01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:36.110]  You should have hit Gavin.
[01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.930]  I tried!
[01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:40.490]  Gavin, you can do the funniest thing right now.
[01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:41.710]  What would be the funniest thing?
[01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:44.370]  To hit one of us.
[01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:45.690]  What do you mean? He's got a shield.
[01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:47.710]  It's a pause to hit
[01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:49.030]  the boss.
[01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:51.870]  Bogey!
[01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:54.770]  That wasn't the funniest thing.
[01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.170]  Yeah.
[01:33:56.210 --> 01:33:57.350]  Look at how sad she was.
[01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:59.650]  I'm playing to win. None of this content shit.
[01:34:00.190 --> 01:34:01.350]  You're playing to win?
[01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.710]  Laughing.
[01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:06.110]  Oh, Andrew, that's
[01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:07.750]  not gonna work.
[01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:09.070]  You got a little lip there.
[01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:11.930]  Do the bounce.
[01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:13.670]  The bounce is better.
[01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:17.410]  He could get taken by the cornhole if he gets it right on the edge.
[01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:18.530]  It's true.
[01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:21.430]  He could be taken by the
[01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:22.070]  cornhole?
[01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:22.610]  Shit!
[01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:24.110]  What did you think?
[01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:27.750]  I thought I could sneak through.
[01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:29.710]  Through the wall?
[01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:31.870]  What, like the wall wouldn't see you?
[01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:32.710]  Are you a ghost?
[01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:35.670]  Alright, should we figure out the true
[01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:37.010]  scores before we go to the last one?
[01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:37.790]  Sure.
[01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:41.510]  Andrew had plus two,
[01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:43.170]  so you gotta take two away from his score.
[01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:45.790]  Geoff also
[01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:47.790]  had plus two, so you have to take two away
[01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:49.730]  from his score. Nick had
[01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:51.850]  minus two, so you have to add
[01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:53.070]  two to his score.
[01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:55.770]  And Gavin had a true
[01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:56.710]  number at zero.
[01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.370]  What are you talking about?
[01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:03.070]  Geoff has 18,
[01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:05.370]  Andrew has 34, you have
[01:35:05.370 --> 01:35:07.530]  21, and I have 16.
[01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:09.390]  Gavin has 25.
[01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:12.570]  Gavin was par.
[01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:15.390]  And you have 16.
[01:35:16.230 --> 01:35:17.570]  So, everything
[01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:19.370]  I just said makes sense.
[01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.190]  Right.
[01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:23.690]  So it's plus 18 to plus 16
[01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:24.910]  for first place right now? Yes.
[01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:26.490]  Okay.
[01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:29.570]  You guys are only two strokes off of each other.
[01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:31.430]  That's a weird...
[01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.830]  That's all I need.
[01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:35.850]  You asked for the
[01:35:35.850 --> 01:35:37.250]  scores, we gave you the scores.
[01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:39.530]  That's the scores without the first hole?
[01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:40.750]  Yes.
[01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:43.630]  Are you okay?
[01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:47.050]  Oh, no!
[01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:49.190]  Oh, shit!
[01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:50.590]  Oh, no!
[01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:51.650]  The hole in one!
[01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:52.990]  Oh, no!
[01:35:55.150 --> 01:35:57.350]  I'm looking to win this one.
[01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:58.770]  The hole in one!
[01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:00.250]  Too hard!
[01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:02.350]  No!
[01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:04.290]  Still almost went in!
[01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:04.770]  Oh!
[01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:08.950]  Alright, Gavin, what do you got?
[01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:10.490]  Oh, I'm really scared now.
[01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:12.430]  Geoff, how does it feel to know you're done?
[01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:13.530]  Oh!
[01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:17.210]  Alright, Gavin, you get another shot at it.
[01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:17.850]  Isn't that special?
[01:36:17.850 --> 01:36:20.230]  No, don't fuck mine up!
[01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:21.770]  Oh, no!
[01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:23.150]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:24.850]  Oh, no!
[01:36:26.530 --> 01:36:27.210]  Nick, help me out.
[01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:29.190]  No, I need this!
[01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:30.630]  Hold on.
[01:36:30.670 --> 01:36:33.590]  Well, I can.
[01:36:35.710 --> 01:36:37.070]  I'm up two strokes.
[01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:42.410]  Just went over.
[01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:43.970]  Yes! No!
[01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:46.910]  Yes! No!
[01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:50.110]  I can watch this all day.
[01:36:52.330 --> 01:36:53.990]  How is this shit?
[01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:56.530]  Oh, God!
[01:36:59.270 --> 01:37:00.670]  Oh, Andrew, Nick needs help.
[01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:01.570]  Andrew, don't do it!
[01:37:02.130 --> 01:37:02.950]  You need help.
[01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:05.650]  Just a little tap.
[01:37:05.650 --> 01:37:06.730]  Wait until that fan's blowing.
[01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:08.950]  No, just a little tap.
[01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:11.050]  That's not a little.
[01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:14.210]  I'm so sorry.
[01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.830]  What?
[01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:17.350]  What were you trying to do?
[01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:19.710]  I was trying to just knock him into the middle part.
[01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:21.350]  You knocked me out of the game!
[01:37:23.150 --> 01:37:24.390]  You knocked him out of the vinyl.
[01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:25.830]  Where is he?
[01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:29.350]  I don't...
[01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:30.910]  Oh, turn left a little bit.
[01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.270]  Turn left.
[01:37:32.230 --> 01:37:34.010]  Oh, that's not...
[01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:34.090]  What?
[01:37:36.670 --> 01:37:37.390]  Okay, never mind.
[01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:41.690]  This is the guy who didn't understand the numbers.
[01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:43.390]  I still don't.
[01:37:47.010 --> 01:37:49.750]  What are you doing?
[01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:51.490]  What are you doing?
[01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.990]  No!
[01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:58.570]  I'm so sorry, Nick.
[01:37:59.090 --> 01:38:00.990]  Oh, Christ.
[01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:01.990]  Poor Nick.
[01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.890]  No!
[01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:09.570]  All right.
[01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:10.950]  I know how to do it now.
[01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:13.250]  If I can nail it, I'll tie.
[01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:16.350]  If I can do it, I'll tie.
[01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:18.950]  That wasn't hard enough.
[01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.890]  And now you're going to be out.
[01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.730]  Wow.
[01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.990]  Oh, fuck.
[01:38:29.210 --> 01:38:30.090]  You got this.
[01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.270]  I'm still on fire.
[01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:36.090]  I haven't figured this one out yet.
[01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:37.890]  I just wanted to end.
[01:38:40.890 --> 01:38:41.570]  That's it.
[01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:42.950]  A little bit in between.
[01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:43.790]  No!
[01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:49.930]  I'm so hot.
[01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:51.770]  We're going to need
[01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:53.670]  PhoenixEdits to make a compilation
[01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:55.090]  of just this video.
[01:38:55.770 --> 01:38:55.910]  Yes!
[01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:02.150]  All right, Gav. Why don't you just put it in that tube?
[01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:03.390]  Oh, yeah?
[01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:05.810]  Oh, my God.
[01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:10.810]  All right.
[01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:12.650]  Nick's going to take a different approach.
[01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:15.090]  God damn it.
[01:39:15.190 --> 01:39:16.730]  You missed. You missed it.
[01:39:17.210 --> 01:39:18.550]  You fucking missed it.
[01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:23.190]  Missed it.
[01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.850]  Finally!
[01:39:24.570 --> 01:39:27.430]  If that wasn't the story of Nick
[01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:29.910]  just being off in his aim.
[01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:31.550]  Oh, my God.
[01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:33.350]  I'll never forget what Andrew
[01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:34.210]  did for me today.
[01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:37.230]  How about what Nick...
[01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:38.670]  How about what Gavin just did to you?
[01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:40.450]  Oh, you're back over here.
[01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:45.070]  That place is not good to him.
[01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:47.550]  I'm just twatting my...
[01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:50.190]  He's twatting his salad.
[01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.990]  Yeah.
[01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:54.130]  What do I want?
[01:39:55.890 --> 01:39:56.970]  I wanted to win.
[01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:02.890]  Oh, if you get the hole before...
[01:40:02.890 --> 01:40:04.030]  Oh, you get the hole.
[01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:06.230]  You got fucking blown away by your own blowhole.
[01:40:06.590 --> 01:40:07.430]  Is that the bad part?
[01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:08.930]  You got mubby dick.
[01:40:14.290 --> 01:40:16.870]  I mean, there's a time to do that
[01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:18.130]  and a time not to.
[01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:19.270]  Oof.
[01:40:20.490 --> 01:40:21.870]  Seemed an odd choice.
[01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:25.790]  Oh, man.
[01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:27.970]  Do everything...
[01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:30.590]  Well, we know you can go at least
[01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:32.130]  19 strokes on the hole.
[01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:34.450]  Whoops, Gavin's out.
[01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:35.550]  Oh, no.
[01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:37.610]  He's back to the start.
[01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:40.950]  He's back to the beginning.
[01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:48.130]  For fuck's sake.
[01:40:48.710 --> 01:40:49.350]  Watch out.
[01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:51.530]  You almost came back with me.
[01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:56.090]  All right, you have a chance to do it.
[01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:58.130]  You can sink it in there.
[01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:00.350]  God damn it!
[01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:06.250]  Oh, man. You get a straight shot here.
[01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:09.170]  You too, Nick.
[01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:11.770]  Way too hard.
[01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:13.310]  Damn.
[01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:14.530]  Way too hard.
[01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:16.170]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:19.010]  Gavin.
[01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:26.650]  Oh, he's back!
[01:41:27.690 --> 01:41:28.630]  She's still there.
[01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:30.970]  Interesting development.
[01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:33.650]  I have to put my controller down.
[01:41:36.730 --> 01:41:38.310]  Get another shot at it, Nick.
[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:42.630]  Just kill me.
[01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:44.330]  Kill me, fan.
[01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:45.150]  Send me to space.
[01:41:45.150 --> 01:41:46.530]  They're behind each other.
[01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:51.350]  They're in a competition to see who can get further away slowly.
[01:41:57.610 --> 01:41:59.690]  Put me in the hole, please.
[01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:01.070]  Oh, my God.
[01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:03.870]  At this point, you're more likely to do it than I am.
[01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.990]  All right, Nick.
[01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:08.130]  If you don't get it in here, it's over.
[01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:09.210]  Nick, please.
[01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:11.370]  Yes!
[01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:16.310]  It's all alone in space.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:22.380]  Oh!
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.100]  What a shot!
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.280]  Oh, it's over.
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:34.620]  It's over.
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:37.000]  Oh, my Lord.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.660]  This video is so crazy.
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:40.960]  So, who won?
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.300]  Looks like I won that round.
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.660]  15 to 18?
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.520]  Because you take two away from you and give two to Nick.
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:52.520]  My screen says high score.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.700]  How does two away from...
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.500]  Two...
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:55.740]  What?
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:01.740]  I don't understand.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:04.200]  Did I win?
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.040]  Or did Nick win?
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:07.160]  You won.
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:12.080]  In the first hole, you were two over par.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.920]  So, your score...
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.980]  If we're just doing two through nine...
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.500]  Is two strokes higher than it should be.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.120]  Right.
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:22.820]  No.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.140]  Wouldn't I get plus...
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:28.340]  Yeah, you'd be plus two.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:31.340]  How did you understand...
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.740]  Going into the hole...
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:36.100]  But coming out of it, you don't get it.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:37.820]  I think Gavin got to me.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.660]  I just want to make sure.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.400]  You know what? I'm going to give myself a vinyl.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.420]  I'm putting me on the board.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.300]  Are you going to give yourself a vinyl...
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:47.200]  Or deduct a vinyl purchase from one of us?
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:48.780]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:49.940]  A win is a win.
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:53.840]  Oh, this was crazy.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.340]  This is an almost two-hour video.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:57.340]  What?
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.160]  I thought we were going to have two 45-minute videos.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.480]  I was wrong.
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:04.100]  Congratulations...
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:04.840]  To you.
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:06.740]  Gavin for winning round one.
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:07.980]  Plan G.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.180]  Gavin for winning round two.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:09.800]  Plan G.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.060]  The G stands for golf.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.580]  Alright, thanks for watching another regulation gameplay video.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.200]  If you enjoyed it, check out the regulation podcast if you haven't yet.
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.500]  A lot of people say they don't like to check out podcasts.
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:26.020]  They're like, I don't want to listen to stuff.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.600]  You have ears for a reason, asshole user.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.540]  We'll see you next time.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:30.780]  It's shorter than this.
