[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  Call of Duty, Black Ops 6, Warzone. Hopefully this is working, hopefully we're waiting for
[00:04.800 --> 00:12.860]  confirmation in chat. Okay, cool. Nick's gonna love it. How's everyone doing? It's Eric, Gavin,
[00:12.920 --> 00:18.400]  and Geoff. Let me know how the sound is. I'll probably listen to like three people and then
[00:18.400 --> 00:21.440]  people will be like, you're just being quiet. And then I have to not listen to the chat
[00:21.440 --> 00:26.300]  anymore. That's just the way things work. And that's okay, because all of the corn cats
[00:26.300 --> 00:32.240]  who are superior to the piss rats are here today. Geoff and Gavin, how are you guys doing?
[00:32.720 --> 00:41.560]  Piss rats? No, corn cats. Corn cats, the superior form of animal. Bring the piss. Piss rat.
[00:42.740 --> 00:51.560]  Yeah, bring the piss. You guys are a mess. I don't know about this. Dude, that's a lot
[00:51.560 --> 00:56.680]  of piss rat. I love it. Yeah, but we got corn cats, truly superior. I love that Eric
[00:56.680 --> 00:59.200]  was like, you're not already starting the match, are you? It's gonna take a fucking
[00:59.200 --> 01:03.380]  hour to get in anything. I had no idea. I don't know. So I guess the important thing
[01:03.380 --> 01:06.640]  to know here is I've never played this and I don't know what we're about to do. You sure
[01:06.640 --> 01:13.120]  say a lot of stuff for someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. I assumed
[01:13.120 --> 01:19.740]  that it would take us two seconds to get into a match. I love that for Gavin, Friday is like
[01:19.740 --> 01:23.660]  Friday Night Fights. He's just like, all right, I'm ready to go. I'm all taped up.
[01:24.560 --> 01:30.500]  I cut weight. Go back and watch. Did you watch Night Coffee Dicey? Thank you so much for
[01:30.500 --> 01:36.160]  the gifted subs. Go back and watch the last time we streamed and watch Gavin in that one.
[01:36.220 --> 01:43.360]  You want to talk about Fight Night? Jesus. What, Pico Park? Yeah, no. What? No. We played
[01:43.360 --> 01:54.700]  Make Way. Oh, yeah. Oh. Geoff wants to fight too. I just can't not make fun of you when
[01:54.700 --> 01:59.300]  you say something in a dumb way. It's like it's so infectious. And how should I say it?
[01:59.300 --> 02:03.100]  How should I say it? I don't know. I don't know. I can't. I'd have to. You just have
[02:03.100 --> 02:07.660]  to. You just gotta feel it, man. Just be better. Just be less shitty. No, don't be less shitty.
[02:07.660 --> 02:15.780]  I love it. It's my favorite thing. One bit from Barry the Moose. Thanks, man. Where we
[02:15.780 --> 02:21.560]  dropping, boys? Well, this is just the lobby, so don't worry. Oh, OK. Thank God. It doesn't
[02:21.560 --> 02:26.020]  matter what I'm doing. It doesn't matter really right now. Oh, thank God. We were just all
[02:26.020 --> 02:29.840]  of a sudden in the sky and I went, oh, this can't be good for me. Why did you shit on
[02:29.840 --> 02:37.020]  Barry the Moose's one bit? I didn't shit on it. I said, thanks. OK. Did you shit on Barry
[02:37.020 --> 02:42.040]  the Moose? No, I just thought you shit on the fact that he gave one bit. No, I was saying
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.440]  thanks. Someone said the game audio is down or loud. I turned it down. I turned it up
[02:45.440 --> 02:48.960]  and then I turned it back down. So you're good. Hi, Rebecca, I did have a good Christmas.
[02:49.080 --> 02:56.540]  Thanks. I hope you did, too. There we go. All right, so now here's what we're going
[02:56.540 --> 03:01.720]  to do. Oh, no. OK. Three seconds still. Pop the map. We'll figure out where we're going
[03:01.720 --> 03:04.420]  to go. What do you guys feel like? Gavin, you haven't played this map really, have you?
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.260]  Or are you familiar? Yeah, I play this a lot, but I always go to the same place. It's kind
[03:08.260 --> 03:11.920]  of boring over there. So I'll go where you go. Well, I haven't really played this map,
[03:12.080 --> 03:16.840]  so I was going to rely on you. Let's go to your boring place. OK, I just go to some skyscrapers
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.640]  and I get a sniper and I just start clipping. Oh, you're going to clip? Yeah, I do clips
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.440]  and bips at the occasional Glock. Do you want to mark it on the map so we know where to
[03:27.440 --> 03:40.860]  jump to? Yeah. OK. Yeah. He keeps saying yeah. You see that? Zarevan City? Yeah, it's in the blue.
[03:41.280 --> 03:46.460]  So let's go to one of those two tall buildings and then I just sit on top and I go pow. Let
[03:46.460 --> 03:57.180]  me know when you guys are going. I'm going to go in about now-ish. OK. I'm just going.
[03:57.180 --> 04:02.880]  Yeah. And then just hit A to deploy your parachute. Got it. And when do you die, Eric? Spectate
[04:02.880 --> 04:09.480]  one of us. That's absolutely what's going to happen. 100 percent. No idea what I'm doing.
[04:09.900 --> 04:16.520]  No clue. I don't play this game. Do you hate it? No, I don't play it. I don't play online
[04:17.420 --> 04:19.800]  multiplayer like shooting games, really.
[04:23.140 --> 04:29.440]  That's all I do now. My squad's being hunted already? We got to protect Eric.
[04:33.320 --> 04:40.260]  I'm ascending. All right. I'm on the building that you marked, Gavr. Me too. Sick. I have a pistol.
[04:40.520 --> 04:45.100]  I went to the other one, but that joiner will buy a rope on the roof. OK. You got a pistol? Eric,
[04:45.100 --> 04:55.360]  come open this. You'll get a weapon. OK. I got a gun. Is that a hat? No, it's portable radar.
[04:55.700 --> 05:04.660]  Yeah, just pick all that stuff up. You'll probably get some armor if you do hit hold Y to add it.
[05:05.540 --> 05:11.080]  Yeah, you always want three plates if you can. Just like in Zombies. Honestly, more important.
[05:11.760 --> 05:13.880]  Probably in this game. Is that Gavin over there? Yeah. You want to go over to him?
[05:14.620 --> 05:17.820]  Sure. What do we do? I don't know. I guess we figure out how to zipline.
[05:18.560 --> 05:25.260]  Gavin, how do I zipline? Hold X. You got it. I'm pissing people off. Oh, that's fine.
[05:26.620 --> 05:31.880]  Oh no, Eric's getting shot. Eric's getting shot. Guys, Eric's getting shot. Rathawk down. Rathawk
[05:31.880 --> 05:38.140]  down. All right, you see the protect thing and there's like one yellow bar and it says Eric's
[05:38.140 --> 05:42.780]  name. Yeah. Oh yeah. If that gets orange, they get closer. If it gets red, that means they're
[05:42.780 --> 05:49.060]  well close. Wait, wait, why are they after me? What's happening? No! Do they know that I'm
[05:49.060 --> 05:56.860]  streaming? Do they know I'm a streamer? I'm a famous streamer? Did you go down? Where are you?
[05:56.940 --> 06:00.380]  Did you go down the elevator? No, you can though. There's shit in the lobby.
[06:02.120 --> 06:06.440]  I want to be with you. I'm scared. Yeah, where are you Gavin? Hey, what's up?
[06:07.680 --> 06:11.220]  Also, if you hear the sound of a rope happening and there might be someone coming up this.
[06:11.220 --> 06:15.660]  So just look at this and then go. Oh shit, someone sniped us.
[06:16.520 --> 06:17.860]  No, I was just pulling the trigger.
[06:23.600 --> 06:26.680]  Hot potato. Tonto or the KSV? I think I want the KSV.
[06:29.980 --> 06:36.780]  Whoa, Gavin, watch out. Dickhead City over there. Don't shoot Eric. We should also try and go for
[06:36.780 --> 06:42.080]  a loadout when it drops. Yes, absolutely. Dude, I was thinking the same thing.
[06:42.840 --> 06:47.060]  Oh, I'm so happy to be playing Warzone again. It's been too long. I fell off.
[06:47.320 --> 06:50.940]  Eric fell off the fucking building. Ascend!
[06:56.980 --> 06:59.080]  I'm doing tricks.
[07:01.060 --> 07:06.160]  Is that good? Did you guys like that? That was great. Oh my god, that was funny.
[07:07.240 --> 07:11.540]  Am I about to get a bunch of money? If you survive, you will, I think,
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.760]  1500 bucks. You got 10 seconds until protect. Yeah, you're about to get 1500 fat ones. I'm
[07:16.760 --> 07:20.880]  gonna go to the lobby and see if there's armor because I'm out. Yeah, me too, dude. I was
[07:20.880 --> 07:33.300]  thinking the same thing. Bounty averted. I got a weapon level two. Oh, I tell you what, I'm gonna
[07:33.300 --> 07:37.960]  come up and put some plates. I'm gonna put a plate box on the roof. Wait, you can wait. I didn't have
[07:37.960 --> 07:44.580]  to take my parachute down? No, you hit the zip line down. Nobody told me that. The game did, kind
[07:44.580 --> 07:49.360]  of. Look, my dad couldn't make me read it. You're not gonna be the one to do it.
[07:52.200 --> 07:56.140]  I got a drone over here, Gav, if you want one. Don't you like the recon drones for some reason?
[07:56.720 --> 08:01.580]  Nah. Okay, never mind. Didn't we do a video about that or something one time?
[08:01.580 --> 08:05.560]  Oh, bomb drones. Yeah, I don't really see those anymore. Portable radar.
[08:07.460 --> 08:11.500]  Is that good? Do we want that? Yeah, I'll take it. Better than scrambler,
[08:11.780 --> 08:16.600]  what I was gonna use. Yeah, I hate the scrambler. No, that's all right. It's just not. Oh, I think
[08:16.600 --> 08:23.240]  the scrambler's okay. Yeah. I use it a lot in regular Call of Duty multiplayer. Yeah, I do that
[08:23.240 --> 08:27.200]  too. We both do that. As you do.
[08:29.740 --> 08:33.240]  Man, that's a long way up. Are we hanging out here still? Is that what's going on? There's
[08:33.240 --> 08:41.220]  still some bosses sniping at us. Yeah, he is. Oh, shit. Go ahead and refill those armor plates.
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.480]  Yeah. Oh, loadout. Let's do it. Let's do it, lads. Let's go, guys. Follow me. Let's go,
[08:46.480 --> 08:55.620]  boys. Where are we dropping, boys? Don't get hurt. Oh, I need to replay.
[08:55.980 --> 09:02.230]  I think I might be good at this.
[09:04.790 --> 09:07.870]  What am I doing here? Is this something good? Pick your loadout.
[09:08.350 --> 09:14.510]  Oh, I'm down. I'm down. I'm down. Can you crawl over to me? Yeah, I'm dead. God damn it. Don't
[09:14.510 --> 09:20.670]  crawl over to Eric. We're outnumbered. We're outnumbered. Where'd you go? All right. We're
[09:20.670 --> 09:27.070]  dead. Now you're going to go into... I don't want to go to whatever this is. I want to just view
[09:27.070 --> 09:32.750]  Gavin. You got to do the gulag. I don't want to do this. Or whatever it is called in this one.
[09:33.250 --> 09:39.190]  Yeah, it is. So there's two individual punches. Can I punch at the same time for like a super
[09:39.190 --> 09:44.490]  punch? No, I can't. Not like Batman style? No. Yeah. Like ultimate punch? Yeah.
[09:49.190 --> 09:53.570]  So this is what people watch for like 14 hours a day on Twitch, huh? It's just this kind of game.
[09:53.810 --> 09:58.950]  Crazy. Yeah, but good. Oh, I guess that's the difference.
[10:00.950 --> 10:05.350]  Now it does say waiting for opponent one minute. That's a long time to be running around. Well,
[10:05.350 --> 10:09.690]  you can watch me. I'm fighting right now. Oh, fuck. I'm fighting. I can't. I want I want to
[10:09.690 --> 10:13.930]  know. I mean, you can look down on the on the thing. Oh, are you? Oh, wait, what?
[10:14.050 --> 10:17.810]  The guy just killed me. Oh, there we go. All right. So I'm deaf. No, I'm spectating Gavin.
[10:19.510 --> 10:23.810]  Little rusty. Yeah, it takes a lot of rush shaking.
[10:32.960 --> 10:40.460]  I got shot a lot. Did you win the gulag? No. How am I in the... What kind of question is that,
[10:40.520 --> 10:45.620]  you psycho? How am I back in the gulag? Oh, you might have got to go again. I guess I did.
[10:45.620 --> 10:51.060]  Am I viewing Gavin? You might be. Are you? I just shot someone in the head. Are you looking down
[10:51.060 --> 10:57.040]  the barrel of a sniper rifle? Yeah. Looking down the barrel of a gun, son of a gun, son of a bitch
[10:57.040 --> 11:05.300]  getting paid. Guys, check it out. You're viewing Gavin's gameplay right here. That was bad. All
[11:06.120 --> 11:10.960]  right. All right. All right, guys, this is how it's done. Watch it Gavin style right here.
[11:10.960 --> 11:19.020]  He can see me. He's gonna shoot me. Oh my god. They're on either side of you. Play, play, play.
[11:20.160 --> 11:26.020]  Okay. So you and Meg, you and Meg play this all the time? Yeah. Have a little bit of warzone.
[11:26.140 --> 11:30.500]  Is she good at it? Yeah, she's, she clicks some heads. Oh really? She sometimes gets like 12
[11:30.500 --> 11:37.780]  kills. Oh my god. Oh my god, that's a lot in a game of fucking whatever this is. Warzone. All
[11:37.780 --> 11:45.360]  people shopping. Okay. See, here's the thing. I don't feel bad about like, oh, I died and we have
[11:45.360 --> 11:50.240]  to spectate Gavin. This is better for the audience to watch someone who's played this at least one
[11:50.240 --> 11:57.720]  time. This is good. Is there a goddamn shop on this? Where's the shop at? Shop. You can go buy
[11:57.720 --> 12:00.800]  stuff with the money you collect. Ooh, stuff. This is a little stuff.
[12:05.040 --> 12:11.420]  There you go. My team. Oh, I can't afford Geoff. Shit. Don't, okay, just don't bring back Eric.
[12:15.900 --> 12:19.320]  Don't! You, you did it on purpose. You suck.
[12:21.340 --> 12:23.500]  Where are you? I'm a fucking idiot.
[12:23.500 --> 12:31.520]  You, you, I'm gonna die. I'm getting shot. I'm dead. I didn't even hit the ground.
[12:31.860 --> 12:38.960]  What do you mean? I was in the sky. Why have you come here? I was, I was spectating.
[12:39.220 --> 12:47.080]  Why would you bring me? Because you're on stream. Right, but I'm watching you.
[12:47.960 --> 12:53.420]  Well, um, when you came back from the dead into your parachute, what you missed
[12:53.500 --> 12:57.540]  when you stopped spectating me was that I got a little bit run over by a train and shot.
[12:57.720 --> 13:02.760]  That would have been so fun to watch. Why would you? Gavin looked like he was trying to call,
[13:03.020 --> 13:10.160]  crawl under the train while it was moving. Now I'm watching Gavin in the gulag. Oh shit. Yeah.
[13:12.380 --> 13:19.160]  Gavin's gonna go left. You got it, buddy. Oh, I did the same thing.
[13:19.160 --> 13:29.020]  Huh. Why'd I switch weapon? What the hell was that? Where's this bastard? Did he get around me?
[13:29.680 --> 13:37.320]  Did he do me? Like throw a, uh, he might be a grenade out. Oh, I missed. He might be AFK. Yeah.
[13:38.160 --> 13:43.380]  Oh, cool. Way to go, man. Hey, good win, Gavin. Thanks. That was great.
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.860]  Oh, we still have loadout? What's that about?
[13:51.780 --> 14:00.360]  Can I get loadout again? Why not? It's like, maybe that's just for you guys.
[14:04.100 --> 14:13.220]  Just bring back Geoff. Don't bring back Eric. Shit. Yeah. That's my loadout, son.
[14:14.480 --> 14:19.640]  Nice. All right. I need plates. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. You got to get some plates,
[14:19.640 --> 14:28.220]  baby. Dinner plates. Let's eat them up. What's that? Uh-oh. Hey, all right. Check this out.
[14:29.940 --> 14:36.700]  Yeah. Whoa. What is happening? Video games are crazy. I didn't know that did that. Oh, yeah.
[14:36.760 --> 14:42.500]  What is that? I can do this. People drone. I know how to ascend. I know how to ascend now.
[14:42.500 --> 14:51.640]  That feels good. Oh, God. Oh, I swear there was two people just about to kill me. Yeah,
[14:51.660 --> 14:56.760]  I thought so, too. Maybe they jumped. Maybe you scared them. They're gone. Maybe they went up
[14:56.760 --> 15:00.660]  there to give each other handjobs and they were trying to be alone. And then you showed up and
[15:00.660 --> 15:05.320]  they're like, ah, our wives. Oh, can you can you do that in this game? That would be that would
[15:05.320 --> 15:11.940]  be so crazy. What button is it? They're always updating it, so I'm not sure. Oh, all right,
[15:11.940 --> 15:18.340]  boys. We placed 18th. That's easy. That's great. So do better than that this time. And we will.
[15:19.060 --> 15:24.160]  Yep. Look how cool we look, though. I'm the pacifist. It's a victory without violence.
[15:25.420 --> 15:30.200]  We're all the three pacifists right there. If I hit play again, does it bring us all back in?
[15:30.540 --> 15:36.860]  Yeah. All right. We played until five or one or until someone goes to kill.
[15:36.860 --> 15:48.160]  I don't know. Whichever comes last. Whichever comes last. Someone just says, did Eric ever
[15:48.160 --> 16:01.660]  fire his gun? Absolutely, absolutely not. Oh, this game's so much fun. Eric, you didn't even make it
[16:01.660 --> 16:04.880]  to when the fucking world starts closing in on us and we're going to start running from the smoke.
[16:06.500 --> 16:11.520]  Man, they just figured out, like, one game mechanic, like, and everyone just did it, huh?
[16:11.660 --> 16:11.920]  Yep.
[16:12.760 --> 16:13.520]  Man, wow.
[16:17.550 --> 16:19.790]  It's the biggest thing since Team Deathmatch.
[16:23.970 --> 16:26.770]  Okay, so we're just, like, in a loading screen, right?
[16:26.790 --> 16:27.890]  Yeah, trying to join game.
[16:28.170 --> 16:29.850]  Trying to join game, got it. Okay, cool.
[16:32.210 --> 16:33.930]  I have no audio.
[16:34.830 --> 16:35.270]  What?
[16:36.310 --> 16:37.930]  Just trying to get some.
[16:41.050 --> 16:43.950]  Here, this is taking too long. What if I just take us back to the main menu and then...
[16:43.950 --> 16:44.370]  No, let's do it.
[16:44.410 --> 16:44.670]  Yes.
[16:48.010 --> 16:48.950]  We were loading in.
[16:49.650 --> 16:51.210]  Were we? Not on my screen.
[16:53.550 --> 16:57.010]  Battle Pass. Guys, I did not level up. I didn't get anything new on my Battle Pass.
[16:58.570 --> 17:00.570]  That Battle Pass is a motherfucker to fill out.
[17:00.910 --> 17:02.790]  Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna...
[17:02.790 --> 17:03.950]  I did it, but it was a lot of work.
[17:04.450 --> 17:08.450]  I'm gonna buy the Battle Pass, but I'm never gonna play the game. I just want them to have my money.
[17:09.670 --> 17:11.750]  Just as a show of thanks.
[17:12.550 --> 17:13.190]  Yeah, absolutely.
[17:15.830 --> 17:18.350]  AdNam says this is the last game they would expect us to play.
[17:18.890 --> 17:19.150]  Yeah.
[17:20.110 --> 17:24.550]  No, I think the last game I expect us to play is, like, Marvel Rivals. I don't think that's a game that we would play.
[17:24.950 --> 17:28.170]  I don't think we've played the shit out of Call of Duty throughout the years.
[17:28.550 --> 17:28.870]  Yeah.
[17:29.550 --> 17:30.510]  Express our love of it.
[17:32.270 --> 17:39.170]  Okie1991 says, Gav, Gav, try and get an assassination. What do I do? Do I hold down melee? How do I assassinate? I don't think I've ever done it.
[17:39.710 --> 17:40.490]  I think you hold down melee.
[17:40.970 --> 17:45.950]  Oh, is that like when somebody's down and then you, like, hold X and, like, you give them, like, a Stone Cold Stunner and they die or whatever?
[17:46.090 --> 17:46.250]  Yeah.
[17:46.870 --> 17:47.610]  Yeah, those are cool.
[17:48.210 --> 17:49.850]  Oh, I thought you could just go behind people.
[17:50.290 --> 17:51.790]  Yeah, yeah. Hold melee behind someone.
[17:52.510 --> 17:53.010]  Oh, that's cool.
[17:53.130 --> 17:53.950]  Just like, just like Halo.
[17:55.330 --> 17:59.530]  Because they have, like, they have, like, one wrestler in this still, I think.
[18:00.510 --> 18:10.110]  Yeah, they have Rhea Ripley is still in this. These skins are so insane. What, what is this? Abolish your black cell. What the, what is this?
[18:10.110 --> 18:11.330]  Who is Rhea Ripley?
[18:11.950 --> 18:13.790]  She's a WWE wrestler.
[18:14.230 --> 18:15.430]  Is it the lady with the pink hair?
[18:16.250 --> 18:19.490]  She's got black hair now. She has black hair. She's, like, goth.
[18:20.230 --> 18:20.730]  West.
[18:20.770 --> 18:21.670]  This guy's name is Markov.
[18:22.490 --> 18:24.930]  Sev. I don't see Rhea.
[18:26.330 --> 18:29.930]  She's under Modern Warfare 3 skins.
[18:30.750 --> 18:31.190]  Oh, I see.
[18:31.210 --> 18:34.770]  And then she's, like, the ninth one over on the top row.
[18:35.050 --> 18:35.270]  Gotcha.
[18:36.730 --> 18:43.650]  And she has, let's see, her white gear, her black gear. I don't remember her in gold gear. That's cool.
[18:45.170 --> 18:48.690]  This is, like, her old gimmick, though. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. These are good skins.
[18:49.330 --> 18:51.210]  Where's the Cody Rhodes one? Isn't Cody Rhodes in this?
[18:52.210 --> 18:52.910]  I don't know.
[18:53.730 --> 18:56.450]  I thought he was in this game. And Rey Mysterio. Rey Mysterio was in this game.
[18:57.930 --> 19:02.810]  Cody and Rey. Pretty sure Cody and Rey are in it, too. That's cool. I'll be Rey Mysterio. I'll get no kills in Rey Mysterio.
[19:07.770 --> 19:11.250]  Hey, chat. Are you playing the Squid Game version of whatever this is?
[19:13.650 --> 19:14.590]  Yeah, I wonder how it's different.
[19:16.810 --> 19:18.270]  We could try it.
[19:18.650 --> 19:19.370]  After this one.
[19:20.650 --> 19:22.110]  I want to keep playing this.
[19:22.110 --> 19:23.430]  Oh, we could keep playing this.
[19:24.070 --> 19:26.770]  I like this. I think I like this. I don't know. I can't tell.
[19:27.610 --> 19:31.550]  It's a lot of fun. Once you kind of get the hang of it, it becomes really addictive.
[19:33.850 --> 19:34.730]  This is the...
[19:35.270 --> 19:42.530]  This is the game type that when I... Emily wants me to play, and then when I die, we just... we just spectate the entire rest of the match.
[19:42.970 --> 19:44.370]  And it's just fun to watch.
[19:51.350 --> 19:56.390]  I don't ever want to touch the ground. I'm going to stay in the air for six more seconds.
[19:58.410 --> 20:00.810]  I only got to make it one. Did it.
[20:01.390 --> 20:02.310]  I have audio.
[20:02.970 --> 20:04.050]  Way to go, man.
[20:06.270 --> 20:07.950]  Yeah, congratulations, Gav, on the audio.
[20:08.970 --> 20:09.330]  Thanks.
[20:11.410 --> 20:12.370]  Same as last time?
[20:13.830 --> 20:14.310]  Yeah.
[20:14.310 --> 20:14.350]  Yeah.
[20:14.350 --> 20:15.790]  Tell us where we're going.
[20:17.450 --> 20:19.210]  Now I know all the buttons.
[20:19.430 --> 20:23.790]  Let's do... let's do this. Let's give... let's go on the weak side.
[20:25.110 --> 20:29.470]  Like, let's go... let's give Eric the experience, you know what I mean?
[20:29.770 --> 20:31.850]  Like, let's go out here and race our way in.
[20:32.310 --> 20:33.190]  How do I mark?
[20:34.850 --> 20:36.730]  Hit select, and then you go to thing.
[20:36.890 --> 20:37.730]  You see where I put number two?
[20:38.290 --> 20:40.510]  Yeah, go for it.
[20:40.510 --> 20:45.210]  And then we just, like, make our way through the woods and through towns and stuff, instead of just camping.
[20:45.710 --> 20:47.490]  Let us know when you're jumping.
[20:47.770 --> 20:49.730]  Thanks for the five gifted subs, RegulationRat.
[20:50.390 --> 20:50.750]  Nice.
[20:51.050 --> 20:52.690]  Oh, what's up, RegulationRat? I was talking to them earlier.
[20:53.470 --> 20:56.350]  Alright, going in three, two, one.
[20:57.010 --> 20:57.630]  Gavin already jumped.
[20:59.190 --> 20:59.870]  I'll meet you there.
[21:00.390 --> 21:01.570]  Nah, we'll get there pretty much at the same time.
[21:06.710 --> 21:10.610]  I think this game would be great if you could kick people in the back of the head while parachuting.
[21:11.130 --> 21:12.130]  That would be awesome.
[21:18.600 --> 21:18.920]  Huah!
[21:20.080 --> 21:20.400]  What's up?
[21:21.180 --> 21:22.360]  Nice! We all landed.
[21:22.640 --> 21:23.360]  We made that look good.
[21:24.060 --> 21:24.340]  Yep.
[21:25.560 --> 21:26.120]  Holy shit.
[21:27.280 --> 21:28.040]  Found a good gun.
[21:29.340 --> 21:30.620]  Oh, I wish I could drive this.
[21:33.340 --> 21:36.900]  I know, wouldn't that be awesome? I'm gonna run back to this barn and see what's up over here.
[21:37.500 --> 21:37.900]  I'm with you.
[21:38.320 --> 21:39.620]  Remember to play it up once you've got one.
[21:40.760 --> 21:42.060]  And then try and get six more.
[21:48.530 --> 21:48.970]  Oh.
[21:53.450 --> 21:55.270]  Hell yeah, I got two pistols now.
[21:55.450 --> 21:56.970]  Oh man, they made me give my pistol away.
[21:58.290 --> 21:59.570]  Precision airstrike ain't bad.
[22:01.310 --> 22:02.670]  Geoff, you got flame foot.
[22:03.570 --> 22:04.930]  You got like lava footsteps.
[22:05.610 --> 22:05.950]  Yeah.
[22:07.250 --> 22:09.450]  I had chili last night, it was pretty spicy.
[22:15.170 --> 22:17.510]  Oh, yes please. I got a...
[22:17.510 --> 22:17.970]  I'll take that.
[22:18.190 --> 22:18.870]  Yeah, go for it.
[22:19.350 --> 22:20.370]  I got a plate, I got a plate.
[22:20.570 --> 22:21.990]  That's right, I put one on, baby.
[22:22.470 --> 22:22.850]  Hell yeah.
[22:23.450 --> 22:25.150]  Alright, let's get to a better building for looting.
[22:25.830 --> 22:26.670]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[22:40.820 --> 22:42.180]  Oh, there's a helicopter over here.
[22:42.760 --> 22:43.120]  Ooh.
[22:43.720 --> 22:47.840]  We could pile in and harass the skies.
[22:48.240 --> 22:48.700]  I have helicopters.
[22:49.160 --> 22:50.560]  Do we have to fuel that up though?
[22:54.430 --> 22:55.530]  That's a pretty good gun.
[22:55.530 --> 22:55.810]  There's a gun here.
[22:56.450 --> 22:56.930]  Where?
[22:57.610 --> 22:58.290]  Oh, yeah.
[23:04.500 --> 23:05.840]  A duffel bag.
[23:06.400 --> 23:06.880]  Shotgun.
[23:07.560 --> 23:07.940]  A plate.
[23:11.460 --> 23:12.660]  Come on in, Eric.
[23:13.640 --> 23:14.380]  Whoa, cool.
[23:15.580 --> 23:16.140]  We're all eating here.
[23:17.580 --> 23:18.160]  Eric, get in.
[23:18.160 --> 23:18.940]  It's just like Grand Theft Auto.
[23:19.180 --> 23:19.820]  Get in.
[23:20.540 --> 23:21.620]  Aw, you actually got it?
[23:22.140 --> 23:22.400]  Yeah.
[23:24.380 --> 23:25.840]  Alright, let's fly the friendliest guys.
[23:26.020 --> 23:26.480]  Let's do it.
[23:27.600 --> 23:27.880]  Ow.
[23:27.880 --> 23:28.360]  What was that?
[23:28.800 --> 23:31.360]  That was a redeploy rope thing.
[23:37.610 --> 23:38.630]  Oh, shooting it doesn't do anything?
[23:38.910 --> 23:39.110]  Okay.
[23:40.730 --> 23:42.330]  I thought maybe it was like a New Jersey drone.
[23:45.810 --> 23:46.770]  Where do you want to go, Geoff?
[23:47.070 --> 23:47.890]  You want to stay on the outside?
[23:48.890 --> 23:54.790]  Yeah, so Eric can get a sense of the fog as it's rolling in.
[23:55.470 --> 23:56.110]  There it is.
[23:56.130 --> 23:56.550]  I see it.
[23:57.310 --> 23:57.870]  It's gross.
[23:57.950 --> 23:58.510]  It looks like a big fart.
[23:58.730 --> 23:59.270]  There you go.
[23:59.270 --> 24:00.470]  I hit the wrong button.
[24:00.530 --> 24:01.110]  I hit the wrong button.
[24:06.250 --> 24:06.870]  Get in.
[24:07.310 --> 24:08.050]  Get in, sir.
[24:08.770 --> 24:09.410]  Get in.
[24:09.750 --> 24:10.990]  Get in, you silly idiot.
[24:11.290 --> 24:12.190]  Get in the car.
[24:13.530 --> 24:14.450]  Get in the cube.
[24:16.030 --> 24:16.170]  He kills me.
[24:16.170 --> 24:17.010]  He made down.
[24:17.290 --> 24:18.310]  Oh, we're getting shot at.
[24:18.410 --> 24:19.250]  We're getting shot at.
[24:19.310 --> 24:20.010]  Get out of here.
[24:20.070 --> 24:20.970]  I thought...
[24:20.970 --> 24:22.550]  We're getting shot at.
[24:23.550 --> 24:24.470]  Geoff, bail.
[24:25.050 --> 24:25.310]  Bail.
[24:26.270 --> 24:27.410]  We're going down, sir.
[24:29.410 --> 24:31.210]  Oh, my God.
[24:31.250 --> 24:32.130]  We were getting shot at.
[24:32.270 --> 24:33.930]  We were in the fucking smoke, I guess.
[24:34.590 --> 24:35.890]  I just panicked.
[24:36.630 --> 24:39.010]  Oh, Christ.
[24:40.330 --> 24:41.830]  Oh, I'm getting shot at.
[24:41.930 --> 24:43.150]  I died.
[24:45.170 --> 24:46.210]  Who got me?
[24:46.870 --> 24:47.470]  Doinked.
[24:47.610 --> 24:49.350]  I got doinked by doinked.
[24:52.770 --> 24:56.350]  Wow, that was a fucking clusterfuck of idiocy.
[24:56.350 --> 24:59.690]  I lost the gulag, guys.
[24:59.810 --> 25:00.270]  Oh, you did?
[25:00.710 --> 25:01.690]  Yeah, but I almost got him.
[25:02.410 --> 25:03.090]  That's great.
[25:07.950 --> 25:09.570]  I just feel bad for everyone watching this.
[25:09.690 --> 25:10.130]  There we go.
[25:10.190 --> 25:11.230]  Now we're watching Gavin.
[25:11.770 --> 25:12.250]  Seeing this?
[25:13.050 --> 25:13.270]  Yep.
[25:13.730 --> 25:15.050]  Now we're watching Geoff.
[25:16.770 --> 25:17.510]  Don't worry, baby.
[25:17.550 --> 25:18.530]  We're back to watching Gavin.
[25:18.750 --> 25:18.990]  Yeah!
[25:21.930 --> 25:24.450]  I guess I'll go to the people shop.
[25:25.950 --> 25:26.090]  Yeah.
[25:27.210 --> 25:28.330]  And then get Geoff back.
[25:28.330 --> 25:29.010]  Oh, no.
[25:29.050 --> 25:29.910]  You don't have to pick me up.
[25:29.970 --> 25:30.950]  I am on my way back.
[25:31.070 --> 25:31.650]  Got myself back.
[25:32.130 --> 25:32.470]  Wow.
[25:32.730 --> 25:32.990]  Okay.
[25:33.130 --> 25:34.810]  Let me just watch you for a while.
[25:36.110 --> 25:37.350]  Don't bring me back.
[25:38.690 --> 25:38.970]  Whee!
[25:41.750 --> 25:42.130]  Loadout!
[25:42.450 --> 25:43.310]  Geoff, let's get a loadout!
[25:43.790 --> 25:44.610]  On my way.
[25:52.700 --> 25:54.780]  Although, I think I want the other damn thing.
[25:55.320 --> 25:55.700]  I want this.
[25:58.540 --> 25:58.920]  Okay.
[25:59.800 --> 26:00.320]  Ready to go?
[26:01.840 --> 26:02.920]  Oh, you mean like this?
[26:09.280 --> 26:10.800]  That was so cool.
[26:11.820 --> 26:12.560]  That's awesome.
[26:12.800 --> 26:13.560]  Oh, I'm getting shot at!
[26:13.940 --> 26:14.340]  Oh, no!
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.260]  Gavin got wrecked in the air.
[26:19.720 --> 26:21.500]  We don't even know where that came from.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.300]  I'm getting shot at from behind.
[26:23.920 --> 26:24.780]  Oh, boy.
[26:30.250 --> 26:30.970]  Oh, shit.
[26:31.890 --> 26:32.910]  Oh, see that guy, huh?
[26:34.110 --> 26:34.890]  Should I not come to you?
[26:35.470 --> 26:37.010]  Is there bullet drop or no?
[26:37.130 --> 26:38.150]  Yeah, there's quite a lot.
[26:38.770 --> 26:39.010]  Wow.
[26:39.010 --> 26:39.510]  There's a lot of drop.
[26:40.090 --> 26:40.110]  Oh, shit.
[26:40.110 --> 26:40.170]  Oh, shit.
[26:42.610 --> 26:42.930]  How?
[26:43.050 --> 26:43.630]  That was too...
[26:44.170 --> 26:44.770]  Oh, Geoff!
[26:44.850 --> 26:45.230]  Geoff, run!
[26:45.390 --> 26:45.630]  Hit the deck!
[26:45.810 --> 26:45.950]  Run!
[26:48.630 --> 26:49.630]  Geoff, let's get out of here!
[26:49.690 --> 26:50.270]  Go, go, go, go!
[26:50.290 --> 26:51.130]  You gave me a bad place to be!
[26:52.350 --> 26:55.070]  All of a sudden, I looked up and it was just feet on fire.
[26:55.150 --> 26:55.630]  Oh, God!
[26:56.810 --> 26:57.610]  Where'd she go?
[26:57.990 --> 26:58.410]  Oh, no!
[26:58.710 --> 26:59.850]  I tried to get the fuck out of there.
[27:00.010 --> 27:00.450]  Oh, no!
[27:02.750 --> 27:03.070]  Brutal.
[27:07.620 --> 27:10.860]  Oh, that door sucks.
[27:14.300 --> 27:15.700]  Gavin's got the thing on him.
[27:15.720 --> 27:16.620]  Protect Gavin.
[27:16.820 --> 27:18.800]  Yeah, and there's a guy.
[27:19.460 --> 27:20.260]  Uh-oh.
[27:21.260 --> 27:22.300]  It's not ideal.
[27:23.020 --> 27:23.320]  Yeah.
[27:23.500 --> 27:25.280]  Not the best situation.
[27:28.060 --> 27:28.980]  You're gonna be fine.
[27:30.760 --> 27:31.780]  Geoff, are you still alive?
[27:32.040 --> 27:33.080]  No, no, no.
[27:33.120 --> 27:33.660]  I died in there.
[27:33.760 --> 27:34.840]  I'm just making sure.
[27:35.240 --> 27:37.360]  My thing is red, so that means they're right on me.
[27:37.960 --> 27:38.240]  Yeah.
[27:39.080 --> 27:39.980]  Yeah, they do that.
[27:40.840 --> 27:41.340]  Oh, here you go.
[27:41.680 --> 27:42.560]  Plate me, plate me.
[27:42.560 --> 27:42.920]  Plate.
[27:45.440 --> 27:48.260]  Do you have any mines or anything?
[27:48.400 --> 27:49.400]  Like, what's your right bumper?
[27:49.840 --> 27:51.100]  Yeah, I put one trap down.
[27:51.720 --> 27:52.080]  Oh, okay.
[27:53.540 --> 27:54.900]  Oh, you might...
[27:55.280 --> 27:56.660]  Oh, no, they're right on top of you again.
[27:57.400 --> 27:57.760]  Okay.
[28:02.300 --> 28:04.240]  Yeah, they're probably just above me up here.
[28:04.740 --> 28:05.580]  Yeah, I would think so.
[28:05.780 --> 28:07.060]  Probably just above you up there.
[28:08.800 --> 28:09.400]  Oh, cool.
[28:09.420 --> 28:10.540]  It's like doing the podcast with Andrew.
[28:19.730 --> 28:20.610]  Oh, God!
[28:24.170 --> 28:25.350]  They were right above you up there.
[28:25.690 --> 28:26.230]  Yeah, they were.
[28:26.830 --> 28:27.170]  Yeah.
[28:28.930 --> 28:31.350]  Could've done with some plates there.
[28:31.890 --> 28:32.810]  Yeah, it's tough.
[28:34.790 --> 28:36.830]  Died at the Urzikstan train station.
[28:37.330 --> 28:37.550]  Yep.
[28:37.690 --> 28:37.970]  Alright.
[28:38.790 --> 28:39.530]  Get back in, baby.
[28:43.030 --> 28:43.850]  Alright, here we go.
[28:44.350 --> 28:44.750]  Here we go.
[28:45.150 --> 28:48.670]  Oh, shit.
[28:50.710 --> 28:51.550]  You shut that...
[28:52.410 --> 28:53.570]  You shut the wall, who's boss, man.
[28:57.440 --> 28:57.880]  Oh!
[28:58.800 --> 28:59.240]  Alright.
[28:59.660 --> 28:59.980]  That is tough.
[29:00.200 --> 29:02.400]  Now we're gonna try it Squid Game style.
[29:02.620 --> 29:03.100]  Squid Game!
[29:03.120 --> 29:03.640]  I guess so.
[29:03.960 --> 29:04.800]  Yeah, let's do it.
[29:05.200 --> 29:06.260]  See what that's all about.
[29:06.660 --> 29:07.500]  29th place!
[29:07.720 --> 29:07.940]  Ouch.
[29:08.740 --> 29:09.400]  Not great.
[29:09.940 --> 29:12.060]  Hard to believe we've won this in videos before.
[29:13.920 --> 29:15.180]  Oh, I choked a little bit.
[29:16.200 --> 29:16.940]  It's a lot.
[29:17.080 --> 29:17.820]  Everybody saw it.
[29:19.880 --> 29:20.740]  Jesus, dude.
[29:20.740 --> 29:21.880]  Hey, pacifist.
[29:27.460 --> 29:28.960]  I don't want to look at this.
[29:29.080 --> 29:29.580]  There we go.
[29:30.640 --> 29:31.700]  Get this battle pass out of here.
[29:32.100 --> 29:33.700]  Oh, but we need a team size of four, don't we?
[29:33.840 --> 29:36.140]  Nah, I can just turn that off so it doesn't match us.
[29:36.380 --> 29:37.240]  We just go in as three.
[29:40.280 --> 29:41.880]  Otherwise, we're gonna ruin somebody's day.
[29:50.970 --> 29:51.290]  What?
[29:51.470 --> 29:52.250]  Jeez, dude.
[29:54.470 --> 29:55.970]  Got a little bit of water in the lung.
[29:57.890 --> 29:58.290]  Yeah.
[29:58.710 --> 30:00.390]  Oh, cool, so we do have a fourth.
[30:00.790 --> 30:01.610]  It's just a guy.
[30:02.690 --> 30:03.850]  Oh, well, he'll figure it out.
[30:03.850 --> 30:05.490]  Nah, that's the guy that just joined the party.
[30:07.350 --> 30:07.750]  What?
[30:11.340 --> 30:12.500]  He joined the party?
[30:12.680 --> 30:12.880]  Yeah.
[30:12.880 --> 30:14.060]  I guess he can spectate us.
[30:17.520 --> 30:21.580]  And then I will go check and see what the party permissions are after this.
[30:22.000 --> 30:22.720]  There you go.
[30:25.380 --> 30:27.400]  Complete objectives to qualify for the next round.
[30:28.280 --> 30:29.480]  Then we do red light, green light.
[30:29.980 --> 30:30.880]  And then we win.
[30:32.260 --> 30:33.080]  Easy as that.
[30:33.500 --> 30:33.800]  Alright.
[30:33.940 --> 30:34.600]  Just like the TV show.
[30:36.060 --> 30:37.080]  Which Gavin didn't like.
[30:37.800 --> 30:38.140]  It's true.
[30:48.120 --> 30:49.460]  So you've played this mode, Geoff?
[30:49.980 --> 30:50.800]  I'm sorry, what did you say?
[30:51.100 --> 30:51.780]  Did you play this mode?
[30:52.620 --> 30:53.500]  No, I've never played it.
[30:53.780 --> 30:56.500]  I was playing regular squid game mode, which is just like red light, green light.
[30:57.580 --> 30:57.900]  Oh.
[30:58.900 --> 31:00.320]  I don't know what this bullshit is.
[31:00.320 --> 31:02.420]  Maybe we can do that if this is stuck.
[31:02.720 --> 31:03.160]  Yeah.
[31:22.290 --> 31:25.770]  Alright, let's fucking... these lobbies take so long.
[31:27.350 --> 31:27.690]  Yes.
[31:28.210 --> 31:32.990]  I know it's gotta be a lot of work to put 125 people together, but...
[31:32.990 --> 31:34.350]  I don't think it's that much work.
[31:36.930 --> 31:38.270]  Operation red light, green light.
[31:38.370 --> 31:38.630]  Okay.
[31:48.350 --> 31:50.310]  Dude, we look cool, except for...
[31:51.530 --> 31:52.910]  Except for that guy.
[31:55.210 --> 31:56.870]  Hey, it's us in Pointless Engineer.
[31:57.470 --> 31:58.450]  Alright, where are we going?
[32:01.250 --> 32:01.610]  Uh...
[32:01.610 --> 32:03.510]  Let's go to the suburbs.
[32:06.110 --> 32:06.650]  Where's that?
[32:07.850 --> 32:08.830]  Let me ping it.
[32:08.950 --> 32:09.510]  How do I ping it?
[32:12.150 --> 32:12.510]  Oops.
[32:14.050 --> 32:14.410]  Oops.
[32:16.530 --> 32:17.210]  Where are we going?
[32:17.810 --> 32:18.510]  I don't know how to ping.
[32:18.510 --> 32:18.790]  What's happening?
[32:18.950 --> 32:19.510]  I don't know how to ping.
[32:19.530 --> 32:20.550]  Up on the D-pad.
[32:20.810 --> 32:21.170]  Oh, yeah.
[32:21.170 --> 32:22.070]  What's the problem?
[32:22.070 --> 32:22.530]  We'll go there.
[32:22.650 --> 32:23.390]  I didn't see that.
[32:25.010 --> 32:26.410]  Are we jumping out?
[32:27.610 --> 32:27.830]  Yeah.
[32:27.950 --> 32:29.110]  Hey, what's up with the lady?
[32:29.990 --> 32:30.750]  In the distance.
[32:30.850 --> 32:31.090]  What lady?
[32:31.210 --> 32:31.910]  Should we go to her?
[32:32.590 --> 32:33.550]  Or is that our fourth player?
[32:33.930 --> 32:35.090]  You marked a game doll.
[32:35.890 --> 32:36.890]  A game doll?
[32:38.310 --> 32:39.230]  Was that not intentional?
[32:39.470 --> 32:39.990]  Wait, where the f...
[32:39.990 --> 32:40.150]  No.
[32:41.010 --> 32:42.030]  Wait, who marked that?
[32:42.510 --> 32:43.150]  I don't know.
[32:43.210 --> 32:43.810]  I didn't mark it.
[32:43.830 --> 32:44.210]  Ah, shit.
[32:44.310 --> 32:46.030]  I've got to Pointless Engineer's mark.
[32:46.550 --> 32:46.950]  Goddammit.
[32:49.190 --> 32:50.950]  Are you at Pointless Engineer's mark?
[32:50.950 --> 32:51.650]  The lady?
[32:52.090 --> 32:54.150]  I was going there, but now I'm going to...
[32:54.150 --> 32:56.110]  Alright, well, I'll go back to my...
[32:56.590 --> 32:56.990]  Goddammit.
[32:59.390 --> 33:01.590]  Qualify by spending the most cash?
[33:01.770 --> 33:02.450]  What does that mean?
[33:03.310 --> 33:04.510]  Alright, let's go shopping, son.
[33:06.070 --> 33:09.750]  I can't take it no more, so I'm going on a shopping spree, yeah.
[33:10.430 --> 33:11.330]  Is that what this is?
[33:13.270 --> 33:14.310]  Oh, fucking slime.
[33:14.310 --> 33:16.190]  I don't have any money to spend.
[33:16.490 --> 33:17.330]  You got loot.
[33:17.950 --> 33:19.090]  You got loot.
[33:20.350 --> 33:21.330]  They're loot-ish.
[33:24.790 --> 33:26.210]  I spent money on an armor plate.
[33:32.830 --> 33:34.610]  Enemy counter UAV?
[33:36.770 --> 33:37.930]  Light machine gun?
[33:38.190 --> 33:38.650]  No.
[33:39.270 --> 33:40.530]  I don't want a light machine gun.
[33:43.970 --> 33:45.330]  Where do we spend the cash?
[33:45.370 --> 33:46.550]  We got to go to a thing?
[33:46.850 --> 33:47.150]  They...
[33:47.150 --> 33:47.890]  Yeah, it's a store.
[33:48.150 --> 33:51.930]  It's a little shopping cart thing on the map.
[33:52.690 --> 33:53.890]  There's one back over here.
[33:53.890 --> 33:55.230]  I got 800 bucks.
[33:55.710 --> 33:58.530]  Yeah, I just spent a few hundred.
[33:58.730 --> 34:00.030]  I have 2,000 now.
[34:02.350 --> 34:03.270]  I have...
[34:03.270 --> 34:04.090]  How about 800?
[34:08.990 --> 34:10.090]  Alright, I need more money.
[34:16.080 --> 34:16.540]  Alright.
[34:17.360 --> 34:18.280]  Spent all my money on plate.
[34:19.120 --> 34:21.500]  Yeah, I just spent a bunch on plates.
[34:22.020 --> 34:22.960]  Sweet, you got us through.
[34:23.160 --> 34:24.440]  Yeah, we qualified, baby!
[34:26.280 --> 34:27.160]  I did that.
[34:27.920 --> 34:29.180]  I qualified us, baby.
[34:35.520 --> 34:36.720]  Cool sniper rifle.
[34:39.600 --> 34:40.380]  Climb the highest?
[34:40.500 --> 34:41.140]  Oh, my God.
[34:41.920 --> 34:42.380]  Climb?
[34:43.300 --> 34:44.220]  That's what it says.
[34:45.340 --> 34:47.040]  Can we use a redeploy?
[34:48.340 --> 34:48.980]  I don't know.
[34:50.560 --> 34:51.380]  Oh, shit.
[34:54.280 --> 34:55.200]  Let's see.
[34:55.600 --> 34:56.780]  Where is a redeploy?
[34:58.760 --> 34:59.720]  How'd you get up there, Geoff?
[35:00.060 --> 35:01.300]  I used that people thing.
[35:01.560 --> 35:03.240]  Motion detected, you will be killed.
[35:03.460 --> 35:04.880]  I did not know that we were on a red light.
[35:07.920 --> 35:08.320]  Uh...
[35:09.360 --> 35:10.680]  I got red lighted.
[35:10.860 --> 35:11.720]  Oh, I'm dead.
[35:12.160 --> 35:13.180]  Oh, I'm so dead.
[35:14.860 --> 35:15.260]  Uh...
[35:17.200 --> 35:17.600]  Uh...
[35:17.600 --> 35:18.040]  Huh?
[35:18.240 --> 35:18.460]  Yeah.
[35:19.420 --> 35:20.080]  So, can I move?
[35:20.480 --> 35:21.200]  I respawn.
[35:22.360 --> 35:23.060]  Oh, red light!
[35:23.620 --> 35:24.560]  Why did you move?
[35:24.720 --> 35:25.140]  Oh, I moved.
[35:32.140 --> 35:33.300]  I'm in the air, though.
[35:33.320 --> 35:35.300]  What am I going to do up here when she turns around?
[35:36.800 --> 35:38.220]  Am I going to get shot out of the air?
[35:38.620 --> 35:38.920]  Uh-oh.
[35:39.420 --> 35:40.040]  Uh-oh.
[35:40.520 --> 35:41.220]  Uh-oh.
[35:43.500 --> 35:45.020]  Did you get mid-air red light?
[35:47.460 --> 35:48.400]  That's not really high.
[35:57.540 --> 35:58.420]  Okay, there's more.
[35:59.240 --> 36:01.800]  I'm just going to stay in the air so we get through.
[36:01.800 --> 36:02.380]  Yeah, why not?
[36:08.740 --> 36:09.640]  Oh, we did it.
[36:10.320 --> 36:10.680]  Cool.
[36:13.600 --> 36:14.300]  We did it.
[36:18.560 --> 36:18.920]  Okay.
[36:20.100 --> 36:20.860]  Six players eliminated.
[36:21.040 --> 36:21.300]  All right.
[36:21.640 --> 36:22.240]  Look at us.
[36:23.660 --> 36:24.680]  Knocking out the competition.
[36:25.980 --> 36:26.600]  All right, guys.
[36:26.620 --> 36:26.900]  Don't worry.
[36:26.940 --> 36:27.360]  I got you.
[36:27.980 --> 36:28.400]  Hey, Geoff.
[36:28.900 --> 36:29.260]  Hey.
[36:31.700 --> 36:32.100]  All right.
[36:32.140 --> 36:32.620]  What do you got, son?
[36:33.600 --> 36:33.960]  Oh!
[36:34.580 --> 36:35.160]  Who's shooting?
[36:35.560 --> 36:36.060]  That's Crane.
[36:36.320 --> 36:37.500]  Who shoots a gun?
[36:37.880 --> 36:38.180]  Oh, no.
[36:38.240 --> 36:38.600]  Wait, guys.
[36:38.620 --> 36:38.960]  Don't worry.
[36:38.980 --> 36:39.320]  I'm coming.
[36:39.540 --> 36:40.120]  I'll come and help.
[36:40.360 --> 36:41.120]  My teammate's down.
[36:41.420 --> 36:41.620]  Geoff.
[36:41.960 --> 36:43.280]  Geoff, get me up.
[36:44.860 --> 36:45.700]  Geoff, get him up.
[36:46.540 --> 36:47.660]  On your feet, soldier.
[36:48.500 --> 36:49.860]  Don't die on me today.
[36:50.120 --> 36:50.920]  Not today.
[36:51.660 --> 36:52.560]  Not till January 3rd.
[36:52.820 --> 36:53.400]  Oh, travel the furthest.
[36:53.520 --> 36:53.720]  Get in.
[36:53.780 --> 36:54.000]  Get in.
[36:54.080 --> 36:54.320]  Get in.
[36:55.180 --> 36:55.900]  Let's go.
[36:56.220 --> 36:57.020]  Get in.
[36:57.400 --> 36:57.880]  I'm in.
[36:58.060 --> 36:58.260]  Go.
[36:58.380 --> 36:58.560]  Move.
[36:58.940 --> 36:59.080]  Move.
[36:59.100 --> 36:59.500]  Go hard.
[37:01.780 --> 37:02.840]  Oh, yeah.
[37:03.120 --> 37:04.640]  Look at us traveling far.
[37:06.820 --> 37:08.280]  Fifth, fourth, third.
[37:08.980 --> 37:09.500]  Third.
[37:09.960 --> 37:10.480]  Second.
[37:10.980 --> 37:11.500]  Second.
[37:12.040 --> 37:12.460]  Second.
[37:13.020 --> 37:13.440]  First.
[37:13.580 --> 37:14.100]  First.
[37:15.060 --> 37:15.700]  We won.
[37:19.480 --> 37:21.320]  We are the squid game.
[37:23.200 --> 37:25.320]  Dude, Eric, you swooped in at the perfect time.
[37:25.400 --> 37:25.700]  Yeah.
[37:25.940 --> 37:27.040]  I had a...
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.460]  I, like, landed near a helicopter and I went, there's no way we're not gonna need this.
[37:31.640 --> 37:32.600]  Like, come on.
[37:32.860 --> 37:33.640]  Excellent thoughts.
[37:33.900 --> 37:35.460]  Oh, and we protect Eric Badour.
[37:35.580 --> 37:36.560]  That's exciting for me.
[37:38.720 --> 37:39.300]  What do we...
[37:39.300 --> 37:40.780]  Run out of gas at some point with this thing, huh?
[37:41.060 --> 37:42.120]  What do you mean, run out of gas?
[37:42.220 --> 37:43.020]  What do you mean run out of gas?
[37:43.020 --> 37:44.420]  Yeah, let's go to a gas station.
[37:44.580 --> 37:45.020]  Get gas.
[37:45.220 --> 37:45.840]  Let's just stay in this.
[37:45.860 --> 37:45.880]  Where?
[37:46.880 --> 37:47.680]  Where's the gas?
[37:48.020 --> 37:49.200]  Uh, you want me to mock you gas?
[37:49.640 --> 37:50.000]  Yeah.
[37:50.260 --> 37:51.040]  Uh, hmm.
[37:51.780 --> 37:52.180]  Hmm.
[37:52.340 --> 37:52.740]  Hmm.
[37:53.600 --> 37:54.020]  Mm-hmm.
[37:55.620 --> 37:56.920]  Maybe that's not a part of this one.
[37:57.640 --> 37:58.080]  Where's the gas at?
[37:58.080 --> 37:58.340]  I don't...
[37:58.340 --> 37:59.440]  Is there a gas meter?
[38:00.120 --> 38:00.400]  Uh...
[38:00.400 --> 38:01.040]  If you don't...
[38:01.040 --> 38:02.160]  There used to be.
[38:02.980 --> 38:04.120]  I don't see a gas meter.
[38:04.300 --> 38:05.480]  Maybe we're infinite gas.
[38:05.800 --> 38:06.520]  That'd be cool.
[38:07.280 --> 38:08.720]  Or on god mode for gas?
[38:08.920 --> 38:09.320]  Yeah.
[38:09.800 --> 38:10.820]  We've got god gas.
[38:11.500 --> 38:11.840]  Nice.
[38:11.840 --> 38:13.360]  Oh, I can play while I'm in there.
[38:14.320 --> 38:14.920]  That's good.
[38:15.900 --> 38:17.260]  Should we pick up Pointless Engineer?
[38:18.100 --> 38:18.700]  Yeah, sure.
[38:18.960 --> 38:19.540]  Yeah, let's go get him.
[38:20.140 --> 38:21.440]  Are we not traveling the furthest?
[38:21.580 --> 38:22.080]  Okay, we did it.
[38:22.240 --> 38:23.100]  We were top three.
[38:23.680 --> 38:24.380]  Big time top three.
[38:24.480 --> 38:25.140]  Oh, what was our reward?
[38:26.120 --> 38:26.680]  I don't know.
[38:27.100 --> 38:28.040]  We didn't get eliminated?
[38:29.160 --> 38:30.120]  Oh, we got cash?
[38:31.300 --> 38:31.600]  Cool.
[38:32.060 --> 38:32.840]  Am I gonna land here?
[38:34.200 --> 38:35.820]  Yeah, to get Pointless Engineer?
[38:37.100 --> 38:37.740]  I don't know.
[38:37.880 --> 38:38.260]  I guess.
[38:38.440 --> 38:38.920]  Honk the horn.
[38:39.360 --> 38:39.760]  Yeah.
[38:41.100 --> 38:41.960]  It didn't honk.
[38:43.680 --> 38:44.860]  Stay ahead to survive?
[38:45.000 --> 38:45.780]  What does that mean?
[38:45.900 --> 38:46.760]  Deal the most damage.
[38:46.940 --> 38:47.600]  Oh, shit.
[38:47.840 --> 38:48.920]  Let's get out and stop killing.
[38:48.920 --> 38:49.540]  Yeah, we gotta get out.
[38:51.900 --> 38:52.300]  Oops.
[38:53.980 --> 38:54.940]  I want out!
[38:55.080 --> 38:55.480]  There we go.
[38:56.160 --> 38:56.860]  Can't get out.
[38:59.200 --> 39:00.200]  Why can't I get out?
[39:00.540 --> 39:01.520]  Hit X, hit X.
[39:02.520 --> 39:02.960]  God damn.
[39:03.160 --> 39:03.700]  It wouldn't let open.
[39:03.820 --> 39:05.020]  It's just like frozen for a second.
[39:05.840 --> 39:06.240]  Netcode.
[39:08.200 --> 39:10.240]  All right, let's go deal the most damage.
[39:11.140 --> 39:11.960]  Yeah, let's do it.
[39:12.020 --> 39:13.000]  So far, we're at zero.
[39:14.380 --> 39:15.240]  We're in 16th.
[39:16.700 --> 39:20.240]  This is gonna be a big uphill climb for us.
[39:21.920 --> 39:22.320]  Hello?
[39:23.060 --> 39:24.140]  Anyone to damage?
[39:25.180 --> 39:26.480]  I'd like to damage, please.
[39:26.740 --> 39:27.820]  Oh, there's a car nearby.
[39:28.640 --> 39:29.200]  Shoot this car.
[39:31.440 --> 39:32.120]  What do you mean?
[39:32.420 --> 39:32.740]  A car?
[39:33.200 --> 39:33.600]  You see it?
[39:35.940 --> 39:36.920]  Just a car?
[39:37.440 --> 39:37.620]  Is it?
[39:38.920 --> 39:39.560]  Oh, I see.
[39:45.490 --> 39:46.290]  Die, you mother!
[39:47.250 --> 39:48.030]  All right, he's dead.
[39:48.170 --> 39:50.090]  That's 62 damage.
[39:50.490 --> 39:51.070]  We're practically out.
[39:52.090 --> 39:52.530]  We're...
[39:54.110 --> 39:55.370]  Great work, boys.
[39:58.770 --> 40:00.210]  I thought that was pointless, Engineer!
[40:04.370 --> 40:05.030]  Run, Geoff!
[40:05.310 --> 40:05.810]  Oh, no.
[40:06.350 --> 40:09.790]  I almost had that sniper down, too.
[40:10.190 --> 40:11.650]  That's okay, I'll respawn eventually.
[40:12.530 --> 40:13.210]  Objective complete!
[40:14.250 --> 40:15.130]  Way to go, guys!
[40:20.990 --> 40:22.310]  Where are you guys?
[40:22.790 --> 40:24.030]  I'm dead, waiting to respawn.
[40:25.850 --> 40:28.310]  Mean pointless Engineer, baby.
[40:28.470 --> 40:28.910]  Are you with him?
[40:29.690 --> 40:29.930]  Yeah.
[40:30.090 --> 40:30.730]  I'm coming to you.
[40:33.030 --> 40:34.450]  Should we go for loadout?
[40:34.450 --> 40:36.910]  Or should we just focus on Squid Game?
[40:38.810 --> 40:41.550]  Loadout's really close to where they are, so I'm going to it.
[40:41.910 --> 40:43.110]  Okay. Fire bullets?
[40:45.690 --> 40:46.970]  Just fire bullets?
[40:47.350 --> 40:48.550]  All right, I'll do it.
[40:56.930 --> 40:58.610]  I'm gonna need some bullets soon.
[41:03.090 --> 41:04.130]  Dude, look at my pistol.
[41:04.630 --> 41:05.790]  Look how awesome this pistol is.
[41:07.150 --> 41:07.510]  Bah!
[41:10.030 --> 41:12.070]  We're currently in second. We're good.
[41:12.830 --> 41:14.170]  All right, let's go find some ammo.
[41:19.430 --> 41:22.670]  All right, those people really did buy it. They know where we are because we've been shooting a lot.
[41:22.770 --> 41:24.770]  Because we've just been firing bullets.
[41:26.390 --> 41:27.030]  Pointless Engineer is dead.
[41:27.090 --> 41:28.750]  Oh, no! Pointless Engineer is dead!
[41:28.850 --> 41:32.570]  He would want us to go on without him.
[41:38.020 --> 41:38.820]  Don't forget to plate up.
[41:39.520 --> 41:40.780]  Give me some fucking ammo.
[41:41.520 --> 41:41.980]  Plate your shit up.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.020]  We need to get in the middle, yeah?
[41:44.500 --> 41:47.500]  Into the circle, but we've still got some time before the gas comes.
[41:48.040 --> 41:48.280]  Okay.
[41:51.310 --> 41:53.410]  I think we should focus mainly on staying together.
[41:54.290 --> 41:55.190]  Okay, sounds good.
[41:59.470 --> 42:00.830]  Please, for the love of God.
[42:02.750 --> 42:03.130]  Ammunition.
[42:05.490 --> 42:06.750]  Oh, Pointless Engineer is back!
[42:08.090 --> 42:08.470]  Sick.
[42:10.950 --> 42:11.270]  Ow!
[42:11.950 --> 42:13.110]  Who the goddamn is that?
[42:14.490 --> 42:15.810]  Oh, help! Geoff!
[42:16.670 --> 42:17.330]  Where are you?
[42:17.530 --> 42:17.810]  I got you.
[42:17.830 --> 42:18.870]  How'd you get up on the roof?
[42:19.790 --> 42:20.850]  Hold on just a second, buddy.
[42:21.210 --> 42:21.790]  I'm right there with ya.
[42:21.790 --> 42:22.570]  Are there stairs in here?
[42:23.210 --> 42:23.790]  Hell yeah.
[42:23.870 --> 42:24.610]  Oh, there are. Thank you.
[42:24.710 --> 42:25.590]  Fuck that dude up.
[42:26.690 --> 42:28.330]  Thanks for distracting him like that, Gav.
[42:28.410 --> 42:29.150]  Really appreciate that.
[42:29.250 --> 42:29.790]  Hey, no worries.
[42:32.790 --> 42:33.370]  Spend cash.
[42:33.410 --> 42:34.110]  Spend cash!
[42:34.170 --> 42:34.770]  Back to the store.
[42:35.410 --> 42:36.850]  All right, let's find the new store that's in, maybe.
[42:37.510 --> 42:37.830]  Okay.
[42:37.830 --> 42:40.430]  I think there is one that's in further.
[42:43.790 --> 42:45.290]  We crossing the bridge or what?
[42:45.770 --> 42:47.010]  Gav and I are going over the water.
[42:47.570 --> 42:47.890]  Nice.
[42:48.850 --> 42:50.390]  Yeah, there's one straight ahead.
[42:50.570 --> 42:50.850]  Oh no!
[42:54.550 --> 42:55.510]  Oh, I got killed.
[42:59.050 --> 42:59.570]  Damn.
[43:00.270 --> 43:01.570]  Don't worry guys, I'll do it.
[43:01.630 --> 43:02.450]  I'll win for us.
[43:02.830 --> 43:05.410]  I keep forgetting about the red light.
[43:06.190 --> 43:06.530]  Damn it.
[43:11.470 --> 43:12.790]  That's fucking funny.
[43:15.350 --> 43:17.170]  This game type is fucking funny.
[43:17.270 --> 43:20.290]  I was just looking at Geoff, stood still, like, did we move?
[43:20.350 --> 43:21.630]  And we both got shot in the head.
[43:24.750 --> 43:25.470]  Come on.
[43:25.810 --> 43:27.650]  That is so fucking funny.
[43:27.890 --> 43:31.190]  Oh, that guy there just got smeared by the green, the red light.
[43:35.040 --> 43:35.720]  Hell yeah.
[43:35.940 --> 43:37.720]  All right, we gotta spend money though, otherwise we're out.
[43:39.460 --> 43:40.620]  Yeah, where is it?
[43:40.900 --> 43:41.640]  Right below me.
[43:41.880 --> 43:42.700]  Oh, fuck, it's up.
[43:43.380 --> 43:44.780]  All right, I'm gonna fly to a nearby shop.
[43:50.410 --> 43:51.490]  Oh, we're not gonna make it.
[43:51.510 --> 43:52.570]  No, I'm getting killed!
[43:52.910 --> 43:53.850]  We're not gonna make it.
[43:54.230 --> 43:55.290]  A guy grabbed me.
[43:55.450 --> 43:56.470]  We're in fifth though.
[43:56.570 --> 43:57.830]  I just spent all my money.
[43:57.970 --> 43:58.790]  Oh, that's great.
[43:59.570 --> 44:00.770]  Eric, that was phenomenal.
[44:00.930 --> 44:01.610]  We're in sixth.
[44:01.730 --> 44:03.770]  I had so much money that I just dropped on there.
[44:03.890 --> 44:04.790]  You just saved us.
[44:04.810 --> 44:05.690]  We were all gonna die.
[44:06.070 --> 44:09.910]  Yeah, I just, I dropped, that's the guy who killed me that you just put down.
[44:10.010 --> 44:12.230]  Yeah, I just, I fucking avenged your honor.
[44:12.230 --> 44:14.230]  Geoff, we already, the money thing's done.
[44:14.350 --> 44:14.690]  No, that's fine.
[44:14.750 --> 44:15.450]  I just wanted to go.
[44:15.470 --> 44:16.350]  Okay, cool.
[44:17.190 --> 44:18.290]  That was clutch as shit.
[44:18.290 --> 44:19.110]  Oh no, I'm getting shot at.
[44:19.110 --> 44:20.030]  Fuck, I don't know where.
[44:20.070 --> 44:20.410]  Boy, that was close.
[44:20.890 --> 44:22.390]  I don't hate this game type.
[44:22.470 --> 44:22.930]  This is funny.
[44:23.530 --> 44:24.190]  Secure special airdrops?
[44:24.190 --> 44:24.930]  Oh, I'm down, I'm down.
[44:25.970 --> 44:26.630]  What does that mean?
[44:26.670 --> 44:27.410]  Oh, fuck.
[44:27.690 --> 44:28.270]  This guy got me.
[44:28.270 --> 44:28.610]  I don't know.
[44:28.990 --> 44:30.850]  What the fuck's a special airdrop?
[44:30.890 --> 44:31.850]  Oh wait, Pointless Engineer's getting me up.
[44:33.270 --> 44:34.390]  How do we get a special airdrop?
[44:34.490 --> 44:36.210]  Do we just find like a killstreak airdrop?
[44:37.550 --> 44:39.190]  Or like shit drops and we find it?
[44:39.330 --> 44:39.730]  What does it mean?
[44:40.510 --> 44:41.110]  I don't know.
[44:41.250 --> 44:42.270]  Pointless Engineer, you gotta get him.
[44:43.810 --> 44:44.970]  Then you gotta get me back up, buddy.
[44:45.410 --> 44:46.610]  You're doing great work, Pointless.
[44:47.350 --> 44:49.010]  Not so pointless right now.
[44:49.170 --> 44:49.650]  Oh, airdrop!
[44:49.730 --> 44:50.110]  Go, go, go!
[44:50.350 --> 44:51.190]  There's all this pink shit.
[44:51.470 --> 44:51.870]  Go, go, go!
[44:52.830 --> 44:53.890]  Is that what this green is?
[44:53.930 --> 44:54.350]  Oh, I see.
[44:55.610 --> 44:56.330]  Opening a crate.
[44:58.970 --> 44:59.730]  I got it!
[45:00.330 --> 45:00.690]  Nice.
[45:02.130 --> 45:03.550]  We're trying to get to these money crates?
[45:04.050 --> 45:04.250]  Yeah.
[45:04.770 --> 45:04.930]  Okay.
[45:09.840 --> 45:10.880]  Plate up, come on.
[45:11.300 --> 45:12.480]  We're at the very bottom though.
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.080]  Are we gonna drop?
[45:13.480 --> 45:13.660]  Yep.
[45:13.800 --> 45:14.220]  We need more.
[45:15.180 --> 45:16.420]  I'm running to the next one.
[45:17.020 --> 45:17.620]  I'm trying.
[45:19.420 --> 45:20.400]  I'm not close.
[45:20.820 --> 45:24.480]  I'm like about 100 meters away.
[45:24.700 --> 45:26.160]  I don't think we're gonna make it.
[45:27.820 --> 45:29.180]  We only need one more.
[45:29.280 --> 45:30.540]  We only need to open one more.
[45:30.640 --> 45:31.000]  I'm close.
[45:31.100 --> 45:31.540]  I'm 70.
[45:32.800 --> 45:33.520]  Oh, God.
[45:33.800 --> 45:34.780]  Pointless Engineer's down.
[45:36.320 --> 45:36.720]  40.
[45:37.160 --> 45:38.220]  How much time do we have?
[45:38.240 --> 45:38.580]  A minute?
[45:38.740 --> 45:39.080]  Keep going!
[45:39.260 --> 45:40.140]  Go, go, go!
[45:40.340 --> 45:40.900]  Do it now!
[45:41.920 --> 45:42.240]  No, no!
[45:42.320 --> 45:42.520]  Fuck!
[45:45.600 --> 45:46.360]  Come on!
[45:47.560 --> 45:48.120]  Open it!
[45:48.440 --> 45:49.080]  You can do it!
[45:51.340 --> 45:51.660]  Yes!
[45:52.500 --> 45:53.800]  You were top three!
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.320]  Dude, that saved us.
[45:55.520 --> 45:56.340]  Holy shit.
[45:56.600 --> 45:56.860]  Fuck.
[45:56.960 --> 45:58.160]  This guy got me, but okay, great.
[45:58.320 --> 45:58.660]  Geoff's down.
[45:59.060 --> 45:59.620]  Gavin, I'm with you.
[45:59.660 --> 46:00.020]  I'm dead.
[46:00.440 --> 46:01.540]  I'll respawn in 40 seconds.
[46:01.540 --> 46:01.660]  Oh, shit!
[46:02.200 --> 46:03.400]  There's a guy on my body you can kill.
[46:03.540 --> 46:05.140]  I knocked him down hard.
[46:05.140 --> 46:05.460]  Where'd that come from?
[46:07.940 --> 46:08.660]  Who got you?
[46:08.720 --> 46:09.020]  I don't know.
[46:09.100 --> 46:09.640]  I think it was Snipe.
[46:10.800 --> 46:11.160]  Thank you.
[46:11.200 --> 46:11.440]  You're up.
[46:12.780 --> 46:13.920]  Play in, play in, play in.
[46:14.340 --> 46:14.740]  Eric's down.
[46:15.440 --> 46:15.920]  I'm up.
[46:16.080 --> 46:16.440]  Oh, okay.
[46:16.780 --> 46:16.940]  Weird.
[46:17.020 --> 46:17.120]  What?
[46:17.120 --> 46:18.880]  It says it's spectating Eric.
[46:19.140 --> 46:20.140]  Oh, now it is.
[46:21.660 --> 46:22.160]  Oh, there's a car.
[46:22.360 --> 46:22.500]  Oh, oh.
[46:22.940 --> 46:24.620]  I think there's a guy across the river.
[46:24.900 --> 46:25.180]  Okay.
[46:26.120 --> 46:28.480]  Shall we get the damn out of here?
[46:28.620 --> 46:28.920]  Oh, oh.
[46:29.000 --> 46:29.660]  There's a guy coming.
[46:29.760 --> 46:30.220]  Oh, shit.
[46:31.100 --> 46:32.340]  Oh, that's freaking pointless.
[46:32.480 --> 46:33.260]  I shot the shit out of him.
[46:33.520 --> 46:33.740]  Yeah.
[46:34.040 --> 46:34.560]  All right.
[46:35.000 --> 46:35.720]  Let's get out of here.
[46:36.220 --> 46:37.000]  Oh, fuck.
[46:37.540 --> 46:38.180]  Pointless is down.
[46:38.940 --> 46:39.600]  Oh, fuck.
[46:39.640 --> 46:40.120]  I'm getting...
[46:42.100 --> 46:43.000]  Ah, shit!
[46:43.160 --> 46:44.180]  Stay there, stay there.
[46:44.360 --> 46:45.260]  Just get out of there.
[46:45.920 --> 46:46.560]  What is it?
[46:46.720 --> 46:47.160]  Distance traveled?
[46:49.840 --> 46:51.040]  I didn't know where that guy was.
[46:51.120 --> 46:51.740]  Is that what we're doing?
[46:51.820 --> 46:52.280]  Distance traveled?
[46:52.660 --> 46:54.180]  Yeah, I'm dead, so I can't see.
[46:54.420 --> 46:54.660]  Okay.
[46:55.980 --> 46:56.380]  Shit!
[46:57.480 --> 46:58.280]  Use equipment.
[46:58.600 --> 46:59.220]  Ah, shit.
[46:59.840 --> 47:00.200]  Uh-oh.
[47:00.980 --> 47:01.960]  I think we're all dead.
[47:02.380 --> 47:03.120]  It's just Geoff.
[47:04.920 --> 47:05.760]  Geoff, use equipment.
[47:06.640 --> 47:08.180]  Geoff, land and start using equipment.
[47:09.140 --> 47:10.220]  We'll be back soon.
[47:11.280 --> 47:12.560]  Geoff, Geoff, hurry, use equipment.
[47:12.560 --> 47:12.900]  I don't have any equipment.
[47:13.080 --> 47:14.200]  I don't have any goddamn equipment.
[47:14.580 --> 47:16.700]  Geoff, grab some equipment and use the equipment.
[47:17.140 --> 47:18.840]  There's a crate, there's a crate.
[47:20.060 --> 47:20.700]  Geoff, there's a crate.
[47:20.780 --> 47:22.860]  Go around, turn around and to your left, to your left.
[47:23.460 --> 47:24.200]  Open the crate.
[47:24.840 --> 47:25.900]  In the crate, some equipment.
[47:26.020 --> 47:26.620]  Use some equipment.
[47:27.020 --> 47:28.720]  Ah, there was no equipment in that crate.
[47:28.800 --> 47:29.640]  I gotta be honest with you.
[47:29.820 --> 47:30.400]  No, that's equipment.
[47:30.840 --> 47:31.460]  That was, what was that?
[47:31.560 --> 47:31.780]  What was that?
[47:31.880 --> 47:32.360]  A right bumper.
[47:33.880 --> 47:34.460]  Yeah, I won.
[47:36.860 --> 47:38.380]  Yeah, you said, you said, Geoff.
[47:38.920 --> 47:39.820]  Oh, my God.
[47:39.820 --> 47:40.560]  Yeah, Geoff.
[47:45.020 --> 47:46.080]  Oh, shit.
[47:49.620 --> 47:51.040]  Oh, I gotta get out of here.
[47:51.860 --> 47:53.380]  Oh, no, the fucking fog.
[47:54.720 --> 47:55.700]  Use some equipment.
[47:56.120 --> 47:57.620]  I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[47:59.500 --> 48:00.640]  I used an equipment.
[48:01.060 --> 48:02.080]  Nice, keep doing it.
[48:02.340 --> 48:03.640]  Keep finding it and using it.
[48:08.350 --> 48:09.110]  Equipment out.
[48:09.710 --> 48:10.670]  Four equipments.
[48:14.430 --> 48:14.910]  God.
[48:14.910 --> 48:15.770]  This is so stupid.
[48:16.150 --> 48:18.230]  It's like Warzone, but shitty and stupid.
[48:19.390 --> 48:21.710]  This is my favorite version of this game.
[48:21.930 --> 48:22.710]  Geoff, there's equipment right there.
[48:22.790 --> 48:23.070]  No, no.
[48:23.170 --> 48:23.610]  We did it.
[48:23.790 --> 48:23.810]  Where?
[48:24.410 --> 48:25.650]  On the wall.
[48:25.950 --> 48:26.490]  We're good, we're good.
[48:26.650 --> 48:27.270]  We did it.
[48:27.690 --> 48:28.370]  That's a redeploy.
[48:28.450 --> 48:29.050]  Wait for that, Geoff.
[48:30.030 --> 48:31.110]  Watch the rope come down.
[48:31.230 --> 48:31.990]  Now you can go up.
[48:34.010 --> 48:34.410]  Okay.
[48:36.170 --> 48:37.290]  Oh, there's Geoff.
[48:37.530 --> 48:38.270]  All right, where should I go?
[48:39.210 --> 48:41.050]  I'd get down pretty quickly, to be honest.
[48:41.550 --> 48:41.890]  Okay.
[48:43.710 --> 48:44.670]  Well, thanks for...
[48:46.290 --> 48:48.590]  Thanks for turning me into a skeet shoot.
[48:50.750 --> 48:53.490]  You can buy me back if you find a store, but I don't think there's any there.
[48:53.690 --> 48:54.470]  Oh, the store just went out.
[48:54.590 --> 48:54.970]  I don't see any.
[48:55.410 --> 48:55.650]  Yeah.
[48:57.270 --> 48:59.370]  We're not in the middle of a squid game, though, so we're good.
[48:59.490 --> 49:00.490]  When are you coming back, Geoff?
[49:00.810 --> 49:04.290]  I don't think I'm coming back until someone buys me and there's no stores.
[49:04.330 --> 49:06.130]  Unless you find a store...
[49:06.130 --> 49:06.770]  Oh!
[49:07.270 --> 49:07.610]  Thing.
[49:07.870 --> 49:08.610]  Fire bullets!
[49:17.740 --> 49:19.100]  You're next to an ammo crate.
[49:19.200 --> 49:19.740]  That's perfect.
[49:23.320 --> 49:24.640]  We're doing great, Geoff!
[49:25.940 --> 49:26.720]  We got...
[49:26.720 --> 49:28.060]  Oh, we can refill ammo here.
[49:28.220 --> 49:32.180]  We're in first place.
[49:32.340 --> 49:33.020]  We're in first place.
[49:33.060 --> 49:33.340]  We're good.
[49:33.500 --> 49:34.180]  Where are you refilling?
[49:34.760 --> 49:35.380]  Right here.
[49:36.320 --> 49:36.580]  That.
[49:40.840 --> 49:42.920]  I'm making sure we're staying in first, baby.
[49:43.240 --> 49:43.800]  Keep going.
[49:43.880 --> 49:44.240]  Keep shooting.
[49:44.580 --> 49:45.500]  There's people catching up.
[49:45.500 --> 49:46.600]  Oh no!
[49:46.740 --> 49:47.680]  They're catching up!
[49:52.660 --> 49:56.060]  This is the best game they've ever made.
[49:56.480 --> 49:58.500]  This is so insane.
[50:01.140 --> 50:02.480]  Oh, this is awesome.
[50:03.640 --> 50:04.740]  The gas is coming.
[50:05.060 --> 50:06.840]  We gotta...
[50:06.840 --> 50:07.900]  Geoff, we gotta go up.
[50:08.020 --> 50:09.900]  Dude, we emptied the ammo crate out.
[50:09.920 --> 50:10.120]  Yep.
[50:10.620 --> 50:10.820]  Yep.
[50:11.200 --> 50:11.920]  Alright, we gotta go up.
[50:12.420 --> 50:12.680]  Yep.
[50:12.900 --> 50:13.180]  Alright.
[50:13.760 --> 50:16.680]  I think they're just on the other side over here, too.
[50:17.240 --> 50:18.460]  Oh, I can't climb up that mountain.
[50:19.340 --> 50:20.780]  You have to go around the left a little bit.
[50:21.420 --> 50:23.680]  We just gotta get high, is that what it is?
[50:24.140 --> 50:24.260]  Yep.
[50:24.840 --> 50:26.400]  There's a guy across the way.
[50:27.900 --> 50:29.160]  Oh, watch out! Sniper on the left!
[50:29.280 --> 50:30.060]  Yep, yep, I see him.
[50:33.120 --> 50:34.220]  You need a sniper or something.
[50:34.360 --> 50:35.340]  The range is not gonna...
[50:35.340 --> 50:37.280]  I would hide from that guy unless you knocked out a sniper.
[50:37.900 --> 50:39.720]  You've been saved from elimination, baby!
[50:40.380 --> 50:41.580]  Alright, is it just final fight?
[50:41.660 --> 50:42.240]  It's only us and them, that's it.
[50:42.320 --> 50:42.760]  Just win?
[50:42.760 --> 50:44.400]  Run, red light, green light!
[50:45.120 --> 50:45.960]  Red light, green light!
[50:50.410 --> 50:51.710]  Hiding in the shrubs.
[50:54.730 --> 50:55.570]  Damaged vehicles?!
[50:55.570 --> 50:56.230]  What?
[50:57.370 --> 50:57.850]  Oh, no!
[50:59.970 --> 51:01.330]  That's not a real vehicle!
[51:03.610 --> 51:05.590]  I'm scared to fucking move with this lady.
[51:06.450 --> 51:07.550]  No, she's not looking. Oh, shit!
[51:07.550 --> 51:08.830]  I'm down. I'm down.
[51:09.990 --> 51:10.670]  Red light!
[51:14.180 --> 51:15.260]  How's that guy moving?
[51:15.920 --> 51:16.400]  I don't know.
[51:16.400 --> 51:17.820]  Are you still down or are you dead?
[51:18.540 --> 51:19.360]  I'm dead.
[51:20.220 --> 51:21.440]  It's you, it's you.
[51:22.180 --> 51:23.140]  Don't move, don't move, don't move!
[51:24.700 --> 51:25.120]  Go!
[51:26.640 --> 51:27.660]  You gotta get closer!
[51:27.800 --> 51:29.120]  I got a shitty gun, dude.
[51:30.360 --> 51:31.880]  Oh, second place!
[51:34.620 --> 51:35.620]  Oh, that was so good.
[51:36.160 --> 51:40.020]  All I had was an LMG from a distance and it was rough.
[51:40.580 --> 51:43.280]  Oh, man. Great game, though. We got second place!
[51:43.700 --> 51:44.760]  That was super funny.
[51:44.760 --> 51:46.320]  That was super funny.
[51:47.080 --> 51:52.220]  There are so many clutch moments in there, like right before we die. That's so crazy.
[51:52.440 --> 51:55.240]  You showing up at that helicopter was like a fucking action movie.
[51:55.740 --> 51:59.780]  You expect Arnold Schwarzenegger to lean out and go like, get in if you want to move.
[52:00.380 --> 52:01.620]  Oh, that's so funny.
[52:02.780 --> 52:04.020]  Oh, my God, dude.
[52:04.060 --> 52:07.880]  It's like a character who left the movie like half an hour in and we haven't seen him for a bit.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.160]  And then he comes back in act three. It was perfect.
[52:11.560 --> 52:14.700]  I can't believe we got second place. That was crazy.
[52:14.760 --> 52:19.920]  We only have about 10 minutes left. Do you guys want to try the regular red light, green light?
[52:20.460 --> 52:21.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[52:21.380 --> 52:23.380]  All right, let's leave match with party.
[52:23.880 --> 52:24.360]  Okay.
[52:26.020 --> 52:27.920]  That was very funny.
[52:28.640 --> 52:30.940]  Oh, my God. I'm a fan of fucking...
[52:31.760 --> 52:32.920]  That was so silly.
[52:33.200 --> 52:36.380]  You just dumped all your cash into the store right before it ended.
[52:36.680 --> 52:41.640]  I was doing it as he grabbed me. If he would have shot me, it wouldn't have happened.
[52:43.920 --> 52:44.320]  Crazy.
[52:46.220 --> 52:49.560]  You're just like swiping your credit card as your foot was being slipped.
[52:50.520 --> 52:53.280]  You've just never seen somebody tap to pay so fast.
[52:57.880 --> 53:00.040]  You try to tap to pay with three credit cards at once.
[53:02.680 --> 53:04.620]  Dude, that was super fun.
[53:05.860 --> 53:08.800]  Oh, my God. Has Call of Duty broken the 200 gig install size yet?
[53:08.840 --> 53:11.000]  I don't know, Sonny Sleazer, but I think it's pretty close.
[53:15.690 --> 53:17.870]  I'm very impressed by how much I like this.
[53:18.090 --> 53:23.370]  See, that's the thing. Call of Duty, it's prop hunt, it's war zone, it's regular multiplayer.
[53:23.730 --> 53:28.150]  The zombies thing, it's all good game types without ever even touching the campaign.
[53:30.170 --> 53:35.490]  I think it would be cool if the red light, green light doll thing was a giant doll on the side of the map that you had to look at.
[53:36.390 --> 53:36.750]  Yeah.
[53:36.910 --> 53:41.050]  God, I hardly even want to look at it the way that it's there. It's crazy.
[53:41.950 --> 53:47.470]  Well, you're about to get a more traditional experience as soon as Call of Duty finds 12 more players.
[53:50.440 --> 53:53.580]  What have I unlocked for Squid Game so far? Oh, man, I'm over halfway through.
[53:54.420 --> 53:55.480]  Wow, you're Squid Game?
[53:55.840 --> 53:58.420]  Yeah, I got... I'm up to...
[53:59.080 --> 54:00.980]  I got the epic Squid Game emblem.
[54:01.640 --> 54:01.960]  Nice.
[54:03.060 --> 54:07.220]  Yeah, it's pretty epic. The Squid Game emblem is pretty much epic.
[54:08.540 --> 54:11.600]  It's pretty cool. A lot of people have been talking about it, looking for eight more players.
[54:18.730 --> 54:22.050]  This is great. Thank you guys for being here with us on a Friday afternoon.
[54:22.790 --> 54:29.790]  Eric, Geoff, Gavin, Team Egg. We are here and we are ready to play Red Light, Green Light.
[54:30.130 --> 54:31.190]  Team Egg.
[54:31.450 --> 54:34.070]  Yeah, it's an Egg stream.
[54:34.510 --> 54:35.250]  I love that.
[54:35.830 --> 54:36.710]  It's an Egg stream, baby.
[54:37.410 --> 54:38.070]  Team Egg stream.
[54:38.410 --> 54:39.290]  Best of luck, guys.
[54:39.790 --> 54:44.830]  Has there been any mention of trying Helldivers 2? Seems like a ragdoll game right up Gavin's alley.
[54:45.470 --> 54:47.450]  I've not seen a single second of that game.
[54:48.250 --> 54:48.770]  Nor have I.
[54:49.250 --> 54:49.950]  I'll have to look at it.
[54:50.790 --> 54:52.590]  It's on PS5, it's fun.
[54:52.770 --> 54:53.550]  Would it be good to stream?
[54:54.910 --> 55:01.410]  Yeah, I mean, it's based in team play and it's not like there's a ton of people everywhere.
[55:01.530 --> 55:04.210]  It's really fun. I have a good time with it. It is on PC.
[55:04.710 --> 55:08.070]  But yeah, I'd be down to play it if you guys want to try it sometime.
[55:08.550 --> 55:09.770]  Alright, let's Red Light, Green Light.
[55:10.350 --> 55:10.890]  Do we sprint?
[55:11.790 --> 55:12.030]  Yeah.
[55:21.620 --> 55:21.940]  Well...
[55:24.840 --> 55:25.480]  Can you...
[55:27.080 --> 55:30.620]  Alright, Geoff, you got this thing. Let's go.
[55:31.680 --> 55:33.100]  How do you know she's about to turn around?
[55:33.420 --> 55:34.260]  Just what she says.
[55:35.100 --> 55:35.800]  You just listen to her?
[55:36.920 --> 55:37.560]  I refuse.
[55:42.380 --> 55:43.160]  Oh, they got me.
[55:43.700 --> 55:44.400]  Oh, shit.
[55:46.580 --> 55:47.220]  Blown away.
[55:48.920 --> 55:50.300]  Alright, well, let's get the fuck out of here.
[55:50.780 --> 55:51.480]  That was it?
[55:53.620 --> 55:56.240]  That was the whole thing? We waited that long for that?
[55:56.300 --> 55:56.960]  Are you both dead?
[55:57.860 --> 56:01.640]  It keeps going over and over again. If you make it to the end, then you're in the next round.
[56:01.800 --> 56:02.780]  Okay, let's try again.
[56:03.020 --> 56:06.180]  Yeah, we'll try again. Otherwise, it'll make us watch it forever.
[56:06.820 --> 56:07.700]  It'll take a while.
[56:08.760 --> 56:12.180]  I've made it to round three once. That's as far as I've gotten.
[56:14.060 --> 56:18.500]  Helldivers is a very Gavin game. Friendly fire always on and ragdoll turned up. Hell yeah.
[56:20.620 --> 56:28.500]  It's like if somebody watched Starship Troopers now and went, well, fuck man, we should make a game like that.
[56:28.740 --> 56:30.660]  And then that is just what it is.
[56:30.860 --> 56:40.360]  You know what, Gav? Maybe that would be the good first game to try out that idea I pitched you with over the holidays.
[56:40.680 --> 56:42.280]  Oh, yeah.
[56:42.360 --> 56:44.120]  Because we know nothing going into it, you know?
[56:44.720 --> 56:55.040]  It's not a bad idea. It's a four player squad game thing, so you can do it solo or you can do it with three other people.
[56:55.120 --> 56:56.280]  So who do we add to the egg?
[56:59.670 --> 57:00.250]  It's tough.
[57:01.090 --> 57:01.990]  Are we a egg?
[57:02.050 --> 57:05.330]  It could be Gage. Could add Andrew.
[57:05.970 --> 57:09.390]  I think does Andrew have a PlayStation 5?
[57:09.390 --> 57:17.470]  What's on PC? And Nick's PC couldn't really run Makeway, so I don't know that he can do that.
[57:18.650 --> 57:21.530]  Alright, so in 2025 we get everybody fucking decent equipment.
[57:21.990 --> 57:25.150]  Yes, I think that might be on the list.
[57:26.770 --> 57:30.470]  Nick definitely needs a new computer. He was having a tough time.
[57:31.870 --> 57:33.250]  Yeah, he was picking a tracker.
[57:33.790 --> 57:35.470]  Add Meg and be Team Meg.
[57:36.890 --> 57:39.070]  That's perfect. Can we do that, Team Meg?
[57:39.550 --> 57:40.970]  Would she want to do it?
[57:41.150 --> 57:42.410]  She would definitely do it.
[57:43.370 --> 57:46.790]  Well, we have to make sure it's okay with Andrew and Nick, but I think that might be it.
[57:47.490 --> 57:48.150]  Team Meg.
[57:49.530 --> 57:50.650]  I'm looking at my own hands.
[57:51.970 --> 57:52.830]  Alright, here we go.
[57:52.890 --> 57:57.530]  If you double tap left, you look at your equipment, but I just have hands.
[58:01.730 --> 58:02.090]  Fist.
[58:10.770 --> 58:11.130]  No!
[58:12.150 --> 58:13.010]  She baited me.
[58:13.010 --> 58:14.830]  Oh no, I fucking lost!
[58:14.890 --> 58:16.350]  I don't want to see you guys die!
[58:17.030 --> 58:18.490]  I'm so stupid!
[58:19.270 --> 58:20.530]  It's all you, Gavin.
[58:22.310 --> 58:23.610]  Wait, is Gavin still alive?
[58:23.870 --> 58:24.550]  Are you still alive, Gavin?
[58:25.090 --> 58:30.050]  No, I walked too soon. She turned around and started running, and it was apparently still against the rules.
[58:31.210 --> 58:32.610]  Alright, we're going back in, boys.
[58:32.850 --> 58:35.230]  One more time, one more time. This will be the last one.
[58:35.450 --> 58:36.990]  Let's not do it stupid style.
[58:37.190 --> 58:39.550]  He's my least patient bunch of idiots.
[58:41.210 --> 58:45.310]  See, that's the problem with Team Egg, is they only know how to play stupid style.
[58:47.150 --> 58:50.290]  I need to get a red light, green light for my soundboard.
[58:50.370 --> 58:50.670]  Absolutely.
[58:53.310 --> 58:58.150]  Alright, we're looking for a map.
[58:59.290 --> 58:59.910]  Let's do it.
[59:02.230 --> 59:04.610]  I think it's my full bladder. I'm going to piss between rounds.
[59:05.470 --> 59:05.850]  What?
[59:06.390 --> 59:06.830]  Alright, go.
[59:07.950 --> 59:09.430]  What do you mean, while there's piss in me?
[59:13.230 --> 59:16.350]  Usually there's shit in them, so I guess this is an upgrade.
[59:16.350 --> 59:19.730]  It is an upgrade, yeah. His pees are way faster than his poos.
[59:20.530 --> 59:23.690]  God, I really love the idea of Team Meg. That's so funny.
[59:23.950 --> 59:25.050]  It is so fucking funny.
[59:26.230 --> 59:29.670]  Team getting Meg for no reason other than we like the name.
[59:30.570 --> 59:31.730]  Listen, we needed an M.
[59:32.930 --> 59:34.370]  Come on Meg, you gotta do it!
[59:38.950 --> 59:41.450]  Like, if we don't use you, we gotta convince Michael.
[59:41.990 --> 59:43.170]  For God's sake.
[59:44.150 --> 59:48.550]  Guys, it's almost 5.01. Get those emotes ready.
[59:49.510 --> 59:58.230]  This is going to be a great way to end the first Friday of the year.
[59:58.390 --> 01:00:03.610]  It is the best time of the week for the first time of the year.
[01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:07.290]  I'm really excited. 5.01pm on a Friday, Geoff. It's quitting time, baby.
[01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:11.910]  We are two minutes away. Of course, we're not going to quit until we get a bullet through the eyes.
[01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:13.730]  We're not supposed to.
[01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.350]  That's right!
[01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.850]  The wait time for if you die in the first round is horrific.
[01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:21.670]  Yeah, this is brutal.
[01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:26.030]  Especially the game doesn't want you to back out. They're like, if you back out, you're losing your fucking XP.
[01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:30.170]  So I was like, I'm not losing XP, I'm going to sit through this.
[01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.530]  It goes like six rounds sometimes, five rounds, however long.
[01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:34.670]  You could sit here forever.
[01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:39.530]  I'm just staring. I'm looking at my hands. Just keep hitting left on the D-pad.
[01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.210]  So what's it about? Just grabbing the things or getting to the end? What's more important?
[01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:45.410]  I think getting to the end.
[01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:53.390]  I think at some point, there's like score associated to it, so you're still trying to get like top three.
[01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:56.190]  So ideally getting there first or picking up the most shit.
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:59.130]  Marazzledazzle, 5 gifted, 5.01pm, it's so close.
[01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.170]  Awesome, awesome, awesome, Geoff.
[01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:09.210]  Wow.
[01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:15.610]  I can't believe it. Well, it's five o'clock. It's so close to 5.01pm, guys. Are you ready? 5.01pm.
[01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:21.770]  I'll be honest, I couldn't hear shit because Eric was yelling about 5.01pm. I got killed!
[01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:29.150]  Oh no! I couldn't hear shit because of the goddamn thing!
[01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.230]  That's how we're going to end? We've got to be short, surely?
[01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:38.850]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:39.970]  Damn!
[01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:44.510]  I mean, we could always do one more.
[01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:47.690]  What about...
[01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:51.490]  For only the first Friday of the year, we go one more round.
[01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:54.890]  Okay, one more round. One more round just because it's the first Friday of the year.
[01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:56.050]  Just because it's the first Friday.
[01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.570]  We can't do this again until 2026.
[01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:00.090]  Exactly. 2026, we can do it one more time.
[01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:07.450]  And, when it's green light, shut up, and then we'll get further.
[01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:11.010]  Yeah, I had to turn you guys down on my headphones.
[01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.670]  No, I will be louder!
[01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:19.570]  Minneapolis!
[01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:21.370]  What the hell was that?
[01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:25.590]  Soundboard.
[01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:29.750]  I wonder if we all had soundboards, if we could communicate solely through soundboard.
[01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:31.930]  For how long we could.
[01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:38.430]  I could do it forever. I'm a little robot.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.880]  Alright, looks like we're just about ready.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.100]  Guys, are you set? Last round. I'm excited.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.360]  I'm going to go back to weapon grinding for the rest of the night.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.260]  If I can get a platinum SMG.
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.140]  Or diamond SMG.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:16.400]  Eight more players. Eight more players.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.300]  Who will they be?
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.540]  Do you think the Xbox is digitally running around to all the train stations in South Korea?
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.120]  Fucking trying to convince people to play the game for us.
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.100]  Come on! Come on! Come on!
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.480]  Do you think it would detect a long fart beyond the green light?
[01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:38.410]  What?
[01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:40.470]  It's not sound based.
[01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:43.670]  So you could just stand still, perfectly still, but still let one rip?
[01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:48.730]  Yeah, it only sees what's in front of it. It's a part of Squid Game 2.
[01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:51.250]  You can make hand gestures behind your back and stuff.
[01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:53.850]  So you'd probably be okay with it.
[01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.730]  You could probably twerk a little bit and be fine.
[01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:59.190]  I guess a fart is a gesture behind my back.
[01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:03.250]  You know when you're right, you're right.
[01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:06.530]  It's not really a spoiler.
[01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:12.170]  It's like a one minor little explanation in the beginning of the third episode.
[01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:16.770]  If I was doing a gesture behind my back, I would do the little circle thing.
[01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.850]  Finger circle, so someone would potentially lose two games at once.
[01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:21.690]  Nice!
[01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.490]  You get two for flinching and then one between the eyes.
[01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:29.230]  Alright, here we go.
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.450]  I'm going to look at my hands. Great.
[01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:32.810]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:35.030]  I can do this.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.360]  Alright boys.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.680]  Last round. This is it.
[01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:58.370]  No way! I stopped!
[01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:04.210]  How'd you guys do?
[01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.870]  Shut up!
[01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.690]  Oh Christ.
[01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.190]  I made it!
[01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:31.410]  Wow! Stone and Geoff!
[01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.330]  This is it. All the way to the end.
[01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:36.970]  Alright, we gotta watch these losers.
[01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:38.130]  Boo.
[01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:41.830]  I like your jacket with the cherry blossoms though, lady. That's pretty cool.
[01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:45.590]  Oh, she's so close.
[01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:46.250]  Don't move!
[01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.690]  Wow, you really have to stop early, huh?
[01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:48.990]  Yeah.
[01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:51.690]  I just stop on her last word or whatever.
[01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:55.670]  And she like changes the cadence of how quickly she says it and stuff.
[01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.230]  Crazy.
[01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.970]  Wow, Gavin was third?!
[01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:03.870]  Oh, that's it? That's the end?
[01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:05.510]  Great job. No, no, no. Now we do it again.
[01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:06.130]  Oh, okay.
[01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:08.490]  With the people that are left alive.
[01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:12.450]  Round two!
[01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:17.450]  Every time I play this and I get past it, it's fourth place. Every time.
[01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:20.570]  Oh, what are these blue things now?
[01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:25.650]  I think those are just more shit to XP or money or whatever.
[01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:28.050]  I've never made it to the end, so I don't know what you get.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:35.680]  Oh...
[01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:45.690]  Oh my god, she said it so fast!
[01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.950]  That was rough!
[01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:48.210]  Oh my god, that was brutal!
[01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:49.830]  Did you guys both die?
[01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:50.270]  Yeah.
[01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.010]  Big time.
[01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:52.030]  Wow.
[01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:54.910]  That was so sudden. I wasn't expecting that.
[01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.390]  I've never seen it that fast before.
[01:06:56.750 --> 01:07:00.730]  Yeah. Alright guys, we did it. That'll take us all the way out.
[01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:03.270]  This has been a great Friday stream.
[01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.350]  Uh, Geoff, take us out of this thing.
[01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:09.630]  This has been fun. Thank you guys so much for being here with us.
[01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.750]  This is great. I love a Friday stream.
[01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:15.770]  5.01, the best time of the week. Hopefully we have a great year in 2025.
[01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:20.010]  Hey everybody! It's your old pal Geoff, and I'm here to take you out of this thing.
[01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:23.490]  Everything Eric just said times three. We'll see you next week!
[01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:28.650]  Alright, we'll see you next time guys. We're going to be raiding Alfredo who has a subathon.
[01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:34.110]  You know, that time is winding down, so if you can help him, just keep that thing going.
[01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:37.370]  We're going to raid him with 600 plus people. I'm sure he's going to be thrilled.
[01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:39.950]  So thank you guys so much, and we'll see you next time.
[01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.390]  Tell him we say hi! Bye guys!
