[00:00.000 --> 00:01.800]  Andrew's singing the song.
[00:07.340 --> 00:10.940]  You're singing like Bippity Boppity Boo. What was that?
[00:12.820 --> 00:17.720]  Well, Andrew's a big Baa guy. But you can turn any song into a Baa.
[00:18.720 --> 00:25.520]  Welcome to Largo's Pizzeria! We got pizza, we got pies, we got whatever you need, we got the breadstick.
[00:25.900 --> 00:28.520]  Our pie is delivered by Spider-Man himself!
[00:30.000 --> 00:30.320]  Was that good?
[00:31.320 --> 00:31.780]  That was great.
[00:31.940 --> 00:33.380]  Yeah, hopefully that sounded good.
[00:33.640 --> 00:35.640]  Arthritic gave us our first one to sub today. Boom.
[00:36.520 --> 00:36.900]  Hell yeah.
[00:38.120 --> 00:40.020]  And by the way, sorry about the arthritis.
[00:41.780 --> 00:43.580]  You said that like you did it.
[00:47.080 --> 00:50.680]  You're not hanging that on me. I didn't have shit to do with this arthritis and you can't prove it. I'm just saying.
[00:51.040 --> 00:53.400]  Hey, Jiggle Master, sorry about all the jiggling.
[00:53.880 --> 00:54.740]  Sorry about the jiggles.
[00:55.120 --> 00:56.320]  Yeah, it is what it is. You know what I'm saying?
[00:56.320 --> 01:02.960]  Guys, how we looking? How we sound? And we got a, uh... I'm kind of testing like the audio and video here, cause Nick isn't here.
[01:03.440 --> 01:07.320]  Uh, so I'm streaming it out. But Andrew is gonna be playing some...
[01:08.880 --> 01:10.720]  MAFIA THE OLD COUNTRY!
[01:10.820 --> 01:12.520]  We're meeting Gavin's ancestors.
[01:14.980 --> 01:18.220]  Play with golden hands. She's got golden hands.
[01:18.860 --> 01:23.240]  I like the idea of testing the audio and then just never shutting up once.
[01:23.240 --> 01:25.120]  So everyone can check what it is.
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.180]  So that way, yeah, now the audience is gonna let us know,
[01:29.240 --> 01:32.260]  oh, everyone's like, oh, this is low, this is high, like that kind of thing.
[01:33.140 --> 01:35.960]  Floppy disk repair man, thanks for the 5 gifted subs, sorry about the flop.
[01:37.100 --> 01:41.120]  Oh, my Morgz is here, guys. Oh, my Morgz with 5 gifted.
[01:42.720 --> 01:44.860]  Is there game audio? No, not yet.
[01:46.180 --> 01:46.860]  Not yet.
[01:47.360 --> 01:48.120]  There is game.
[01:48.380 --> 01:52.280]  Oh, there is game? Oh my goodness. Well, if there's game, do you want to get right into it?
[01:52.280 --> 01:54.640]  Let's get into game. Oh, okay.
[01:55.940 --> 01:57.460]  Start new game. Great.
[01:58.580 --> 02:00.280]  What's the only punch up button?
[02:03.980 --> 02:07.700]  What is it? It was X, so it would be Y.
[02:09.500 --> 02:11.240]  Crucified donkey, oh, my God.
[02:11.740 --> 02:12.900]  Santa and Sib.
[02:14.140 --> 02:14.760]  Game's all here.
[02:15.280 --> 02:16.500]  This is great.
[02:17.400 --> 02:18.480]  And Jumbo Crazy Eyes.
[02:18.620 --> 02:20.860]  Dude, everyone's here. 5 gifted, my goodness.
[02:20.860 --> 02:21.860]  Why?
[02:22.280 --> 02:25.020]  That's a level 9 hype train in one go.
[02:25.080 --> 02:26.740]  Damn, even Cecilia?
[02:27.580 --> 02:27.860]  Wow.
[02:29.260 --> 02:30.340]  Gavin, you ever been to Cecilia?
[02:31.340 --> 02:31.820]  Nope.
[02:32.560 --> 02:33.020]  Nice.
[02:33.960 --> 02:34.340]  Okay.
[02:37.220 --> 02:39.020]  Sent us Meg, thanks for the 5 gifted subs.
[02:39.240 --> 02:39.960]  You ever been to 1904?
[02:40.280 --> 02:40.720]  Megma.
[02:41.680 --> 02:42.300]  No.
[02:44.180 --> 02:44.620]  Nah, it's open.
[02:45.060 --> 02:45.400]  No.
[02:51.350 --> 02:53.390]  It's a bright match.
[02:54.530 --> 02:55.950]  Maybe it's just really, really dark there.
[02:56.830 --> 02:57.230]  Yeah.
[03:00.850 --> 03:03.210]  Does it make sense for them to have Italian accents?
[03:04.670 --> 03:05.110]  In Italy?
[03:06.890 --> 03:07.290]  Yeah, right.
[03:07.370 --> 03:09.390]  But, like, you would think they're not speaking English, right?
[03:10.530 --> 03:11.810]  Oh, yeah, probably not.
[03:12.110 --> 03:14.510]  Maybe they're practicing their English because maybe they're thinking about moving.
[03:15.170 --> 03:18.390]  This whole game, we have to imagine they're practicing their English.
[03:18.550 --> 03:18.750]  Yeah.
[03:19.790 --> 03:20.830]  I like that a lot.
[03:21.830 --> 03:23.510]  Have you ever lit a match using your face?
[03:24.670 --> 03:26.170]  I feel like I don't see that anymore.
[03:26.990 --> 03:29.710]  I grew up in an era of safety matches where you can't really do that.
[03:29.870 --> 03:30.070]  Yeah.
[03:31.110 --> 03:34.370]  What part of your face do you think you would use to light a match?
[03:35.250 --> 03:36.610]  Just under the chin, probably?
[03:36.910 --> 03:38.090]  Yeah, it's gotta be.
[03:38.470 --> 03:41.230]  Where the grain is, like, against me.
[03:43.410 --> 03:44.290]  Cranium Overload?
[03:45.010 --> 03:46.310]  Thanks for the 5 gifted subs.
[03:47.450 --> 03:50.870]  This is gonna be Jane Austen's Mafia instead of Anything Serious.
[03:56.090 --> 03:58.770]  This was the spot. Check under that rubble.
[04:01.750 --> 04:02.710]  I'm checking.
[04:03.330 --> 04:05.830]  This is the manual labor of the video game.
[04:06.390 --> 04:07.670]  Well, that was Roadcraft.
[04:07.870 --> 04:10.070]  Hey, at least in Roadcraft, I got a winch.
[04:16.270 --> 04:18.570]  I wonder what year the winch was invented.
[04:19.970 --> 04:21.270]  Maybe that's what he's holding.
[04:21.810 --> 04:25.330]  What do you think, like, 1700s?
[04:28.170 --> 04:28.530]  1400s?
[04:28.690 --> 04:31.030]  Guys, I don't want to interrupt, but Hounds just gifted 10 subs.
[04:31.750 --> 04:32.710]  There's only one way to find out.
[04:32.770 --> 04:34.210]  Thank you so much, thank you so much.
[04:35.250 --> 04:39.490]  Audience, we're gonna have to rely on you.
[04:39.590 --> 04:46.350]  I saw one comment the other day from somebody that said they're sick of me looking stuff up during podcasts and recordings,
[04:46.450 --> 04:48.750]  so I'm not gonna do it ever again, so now I'm gonna rely on the audience.
[04:49.350 --> 04:50.230]  What did you look up?
[04:50.710 --> 04:51.410]  I don't know.
[04:52.070 --> 04:52.810]  It was just one comment.
[04:53.150 --> 04:54.910]  I was like, alright, fuck you, I'm never gonna do it again then.
[04:55.070 --> 04:56.170]  You saw one comment?
[04:56.610 --> 04:57.650]  Oh yeah, that's how it works.
[04:58.010 --> 04:59.070]  That's why I try not to see any comments.
[04:59.910 --> 05:01.870]  Winch invented 700 BC.
[05:02.370 --> 05:02.590]  Wow.
[05:03.010 --> 05:04.610]  Thank you, 700 BC, appreciate it.
[05:04.830 --> 05:05.430]  That's Enzo.
[05:05.990 --> 05:07.010]  That's the Enzo pig.
[05:08.170 --> 05:09.790]  When was the electric winch invented?
[05:12.430 --> 05:15.030]  He's no longer a child putting away his childish things.
[05:16.250 --> 05:17.370]  Only pig in Sicily.
[05:17.550 --> 05:18.850]  I've had it since I was brought here.
[05:19.230 --> 05:19.590]  Enzo.
[05:25.110 --> 05:26.570]  Is this what it's like in Sicily?
[05:28.510 --> 05:29.310]  I think so.
[05:31.950 --> 05:34.310]  Gavin, you've never been there, so you wouldn't know, but what do you think?
[05:36.230 --> 05:37.050]  About this cave?
[05:37.670 --> 05:38.030]  Yeah.
[05:39.550 --> 05:40.090]  Nice, isn't it?
[05:41.410 --> 05:42.830]  I mean, it's a pretty good cave.
[05:44.050 --> 05:44.670]  Lots of headroom?
[05:45.130 --> 05:45.990]  Lots of space.
[05:46.090 --> 05:47.490]  There is, there's a lot of headroom.
[05:48.210 --> 05:51.330]  Pink Floyd hemorrhoid with the gifted as well as crucified donkey.
[05:55.350 --> 05:57.450]  And Cade Wolfe as well, thank you so much.
[05:57.610 --> 05:58.330]  Oh man.
[06:04.850 --> 06:07.370]  This has got me in the mood for Assassin's Creed, I think.
[06:07.690 --> 06:11.250]  I was about to say that this feels very Assassin's Creed so far.
[06:12.770 --> 06:13.950]  You think it's just the accents?
[06:14.830 --> 06:15.030]  Yeah.
[06:15.030 --> 06:16.330]  I don't, but I...
[06:20.970 --> 06:24.370]  My kid just finished Odyssey, and I gotta say, that was like a really good game.
[06:24.510 --> 06:24.770]  Oh yeah.
[06:25.790 --> 06:26.750]  I played Odyssey, I liked it.
[06:27.530 --> 06:28.090]  A lot.
[06:28.770 --> 06:31.650]  It's one of the biggest maps I've ever seen in my life.
[06:31.990 --> 06:34.310]  They've been, she and her boyfriend have been playing it all summer.
[06:34.490 --> 06:36.130]  They just wrapped last night.
[06:36.310 --> 06:36.790]  He used the summer.
[06:37.750 --> 06:43.970]  My favorite thing to do in that game was to find cult members that were way beyond my level and just kick them into the sea.
[06:46.310 --> 06:47.890]  Get that out the door.
[06:48.230 --> 06:49.350]  This guy likes kicking too.
[06:49.590 --> 06:50.950]  I can't.
[06:52.050 --> 06:52.530]  What?
[06:53.090 --> 06:54.170]  What's his anchor integrity?
[06:55.130 --> 06:59.570]  It's at least zero, and I think his life integrity is about to be zero also.
[06:59.730 --> 07:02.710]  There is no God there. Not down here.
[07:04.830 --> 07:10.750]  Think you've played a game and then realized you were completely wrong and you haven't played it, and all of your memories of playing it are false?
[07:11.930 --> 07:12.290]  No.
[07:12.950 --> 07:13.290]  What?
[07:13.290 --> 07:13.530]  No.
[07:14.770 --> 07:15.130]  What do you have?
[07:15.130 --> 07:26.770]  I started playing Borderlands 3 together last night, and I could have sworn I played and beat Borderlands 3 when it came out, but I had never seen one second of that game before.
[07:26.950 --> 07:30.630]  It's like, it's like so not memorable. Like it's not, you know.
[07:31.270 --> 07:32.290]  No, I get it.
[07:33.490 --> 07:36.090]  I don't think I've ever played it. I think I was just wrong.
[07:36.930 --> 07:38.430]  I could have sworn I played it.
[07:39.510 --> 07:47.130]  I could see that with that game, though. It feels like a game that you could convince yourself you played, because it's not all that different from any of the other Borderlands.
[07:47.810 --> 07:51.310]  I feel like I play games twice and they're completely different each time, though.
[07:51.530 --> 07:54.770]  Like the second time I played Cyberpunk, I liked it way more than the first.
[07:54.890 --> 07:55.350]  Oh, really?
[07:56.510 --> 07:56.750]  Yeah.
[07:56.930 --> 07:57.450]  Oh, interesting.
[07:58.430 --> 08:01.570]  Also, playing Hitman with the map has been pretty life-changing.
[08:09.590 --> 08:12.910]  Oh, the beginning of games sucks.
[08:13.350 --> 08:16.630]  I think that melee video you're talking about, the gobble, is Borderlands 2.
[08:18.990 --> 08:20.550]  Sorry, just answering a question in the chat.
[08:21.290 --> 08:24.870]  I think I'll probably play every Borderlands game that is like a shooter.
[08:25.150 --> 08:29.910]  Like when they did like the spin-off, like, yeah, this is like a Telltale game. It's like, that's like not my thing.
[08:30.090 --> 08:34.630]  Dude, that being said, that Telltale game was maybe the best Telltale game.
[08:35.690 --> 08:36.350]  The first season.
[08:36.350 --> 08:38.910]  It was so good.
[08:38.930 --> 08:39.810]  I don't know anyone.
[08:40.690 --> 08:43.270]  Have you played the second one? You'd be the first person then.
[08:43.470 --> 08:46.910]  I think I played it when it came out, but I have no memory of it. I was thinking it was decent.
[08:48.330 --> 08:52.110]  I love that this was another Borderlands 3 situation you've never played.
[08:52.130 --> 08:52.690]  I've never played it.
[08:55.070 --> 08:59.170]  I really, really, really liked the Borderlands. It was a little Vaughn and all that, yeah.
[09:01.790 --> 09:07.190]  God, look at the lighting on this.
[09:07.770 --> 09:08.970]  This is a good looking game, man.
[09:10.210 --> 09:10.870]  It's beautiful.
[09:13.050 --> 09:15.770]  I think this is just how games look now though, right? Like...
[09:15.770 --> 09:16.030]  Sure.
[09:16.730 --> 09:19.570]  Whoa, he's going to Santa Barbara? Cool.
[09:24.550 --> 09:26.270]  Can I sprint? Do I have a sprint button?
[09:27.890 --> 09:28.670]  Too sandy.
[09:31.370 --> 09:34.510]  With no shoes on? No thanks. Nick's really missing out.
[09:34.890 --> 09:37.730]  Yeah, he's going fucking crazy right now.
[09:39.490 --> 09:43.210]  That's probably why he didn't show up today. He knew he wouldn't be able to control himself.
[09:44.230 --> 09:46.030]  There might be some MILFs in this village though.
[09:46.590 --> 09:48.710]  Is that a shrine? Did I pass the shrine?
[09:48.830 --> 09:50.230]  Of course you did! Pay attention!
[09:51.770 --> 09:53.030]  I mean, you're walking away from the marker.
[09:53.350 --> 09:55.530]  Yes, but there's a white marker over here on the left.
[09:56.270 --> 09:57.750]  I was so focused on the other marker.
[09:57.970 --> 09:59.670]  He was staring at the feet, Nick style.
[10:03.270 --> 10:05.450]  Heard there might be MILFs, he started looking around.
[10:06.390 --> 10:06.810]  MILFs?
[10:08.250 --> 10:09.230]  Where are they?
[10:10.550 --> 10:11.290]  There's one!
[10:11.470 --> 10:13.730]  Yeah, there's one MILF, ten MILFs.
[10:14.770 --> 10:16.410]  When it's an action, I don't think that works.
[10:16.850 --> 10:20.930]  I thought it was a murder of MILFs.
[10:26.540 --> 10:28.800]  Hey Natsu, what do we have today?
[10:29.480 --> 10:30.080]  You're too late.
[10:31.080 --> 10:32.280]  What MILFs do you even stand for?
[10:32.300 --> 10:35.100]  Not my problem. Want to complain? Take it to Spadaro.
[10:35.960 --> 10:41.840]  Somebody jiggered the bomb and said, if you can get through the snow opening of Red Dead Redemption 2, you can get through the start of any game.
[10:42.080 --> 10:46.160]  I couldn't get through the snow. That's what did it to me.
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.000]  You should have. The game's incredible once you get past that part.
[10:49.740 --> 10:50.680]  Even that part's pretty good.
[10:50.680 --> 10:59.220]  So, they speak Italian sometimes and they speak in Italian accents the whole time.
[11:00.660 --> 11:01.480]  But it's English.
[11:01.480 --> 11:02.140]  Yeah, they're multilingual.
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.800]  I mean, what would you prefer? Just a bunch of copies? Or like, a foreign language?
[11:09.700 --> 11:14.760]  No, I think it would just be like, the accents are just throwing me so much. It just doesn't make sense to me.
[11:16.340 --> 11:19.920]  Do you have a favorite handling of that in media?
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.300]  I really like how they handle it in the hunt for Red October, where they slowly zoom into the mouth and then zoom out.
[11:26.680 --> 11:27.560]  That was great.
[11:29.740 --> 11:35.440]  But then it kind of took me out of it, because I just assumed that Sean Connery just refused to speak any foreign language.
[11:36.120 --> 11:40.100]  Did you ever see the Antonio Banderas movie, The 13th Warrior?
[11:40.720 --> 11:41.000]  No.
[11:41.760 --> 11:48.140]  They did a cool thing there where he's like a guy who gets kidnapped by a bunch of Vikings or some shit, and there's a language barrier.
[11:48.140 --> 11:51.100]  So any time they speak, you can't understand what the fuck they're saying.
[11:51.460 --> 11:56.940]  And then he's like sitting around the fire, and every once in a while you'll hear an English word, and he'll perk up and he'll look.
[11:57.060 --> 12:01.080]  And it's like him learning their language around the fire at night.
[12:01.260 --> 12:06.700]  And then it transitions in over a montage to them suddenly being able to understand them, and then everybody just speaks English.
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.300]  That's very cool.
[12:09.980 --> 12:14.540]  I was hoping that would happen for me in Donkey Kong, but I could never understand what the elders were saying.
[12:14.540 --> 12:21.520]  That's what I'm saying. The language there doesn't make any sense. That game doesn't make any sense of that stuff. It's wacky.
[12:24.260 --> 12:29.060]  She speaks English, everyone else speaks ape, and then she sings in ape. It's very strange.
[12:30.540 --> 12:32.480]  I don't think the language is ape, though.
[12:33.260 --> 12:34.640]  What language do you think it is?
[12:36.600 --> 12:38.800]  Just like... underground language.
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.280]  Okay, that's fine. Yeah, underground language is fine.
[12:42.960 --> 12:45.300]  Because everyone above would be...
[12:45.300 --> 12:47.580]  Like Sleestack language? Thank you, Braxtorman.
[12:48.020 --> 12:48.980]  Yeah, as above, so below.
[12:49.280 --> 12:49.960]  Thank you, Brax.
[12:51.040 --> 12:52.400]  Keep your heart, Sleestacks.
[13:08.700 --> 13:11.980]  That was fucking great. That was really, really good.
[13:11.980 --> 13:13.020]  Very funny, Gavin.
[13:13.060 --> 13:14.060]  That was awesome, man.
[13:15.020 --> 13:15.940]  Oh, Christ.
[13:19.620 --> 13:20.480]  That's a lot of bread.
[13:21.760 --> 13:24.200]  Gotta get that bread. Bread box.
[13:24.800 --> 13:27.640]  So when they say bigger than a bread box, that's what they mean, I guess.
[13:27.860 --> 13:30.020]  Yep, yep. That's the bread box.
[13:36.200 --> 13:37.560]  It's Stephen Sethson.
[13:38.620 --> 13:40.260]  Gavin with his annual joke.
[13:47.960 --> 13:49.880]  We'll take the old rest of the year off here.
[13:50.340 --> 13:53.120]  That was an old joke. That was an old bit we used to do with Jack.
[13:53.320 --> 13:55.760]  Like on the rare occasion he'd make us laugh and he'd be like,
[13:55.820 --> 13:57.160]  Alright, well that's it. I'll see you guys for the year.
[13:57.580 --> 13:58.700]  And I'll see you guys next year.
[13:58.760 --> 14:01.220]  But he was serious with it. He didn't try again until next year.
[14:05.940 --> 14:08.280]  Rotting Skellington, thank you very much for the sub.
[14:09.080 --> 14:10.000]  Really appreciate it.
[14:10.280 --> 14:11.060]  Rotting Skellington.
[14:17.540 --> 14:20.880]  Nah, it should be fine. Just hand him bread or whatever.
[14:21.040 --> 14:22.480]  Yeah, you just pay off your debt.
[14:22.480 --> 14:22.780]  Yeah.
[14:31.840 --> 14:33.860]  So this is how the Mafia started?
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.020]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:37.020 --> 14:41.160]  They don't tell you about how much walking there was in early Mafia.
[14:41.780 --> 14:43.800]  Where do you think the 10,000 steps thing came from?
[14:44.480 --> 14:46.020]  The bullshit Al Capone made up.
[14:46.020 --> 14:46.360]  Yeah.
[14:57.180 --> 15:00.940]  It'd be a power move to pay your debts off to somebody who is just laying in bed.
[15:02.820 --> 15:04.900]  Walk up to them just laying out.
[15:05.440 --> 15:07.120]  Hey, Eric, I got a question for you here.
[15:07.160 --> 15:14.000]  He said, have you talked about how you already released the skateboard guillotine and then talked around it for an entire podcast?
[15:16.280 --> 15:18.360]  You can ask Gavin about it if you want.
[15:19.300 --> 15:23.620]  We shot the skateboard sandwich crash literally right after that podcast.
[15:24.900 --> 15:26.540]  Like 10 minutes after the podcast.
[15:26.620 --> 15:30.040]  It was because Andrew suggested we added it to that video.
[15:30.220 --> 15:34.780]  Yeah, we did.
[15:35.720 --> 15:42.740]  It was a spur of the moment thing, which allowed us to utilize the full power of having an office for once. It was very cool.
[15:43.760 --> 15:46.900]  It was a quick turnaround, like it came out the day after we filmed it.
[15:47.060 --> 15:52.800]  But yeah, it did mean that us trying not to say it in the episode made little sense.
[15:52.800 --> 15:54.760]  Made it just spoiled a little bit.
[15:54.940 --> 16:00.680]  But we thought that the idea of flattening a sandwich with the guillotine was funny enough to do it.
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.300]  And I did enjoy Nick immediately eating it.
[16:13.160 --> 16:15.220]  Nick, do you want to try to flatten the sandwich now?
[16:15.460 --> 16:16.380]  No, I'm just going to eat this one.
[16:16.380 --> 16:23.800]  When he takes a bite and he looks at the camera and says, oh, so flat. That's the funniest thing you've ever done.
[16:26.780 --> 16:28.640]  Has Gavin figured out how to use a calendar yet?
[16:28.980 --> 16:34.580]  No, I did try on a different browser and a different account and it did the same thing.
[16:34.720 --> 16:35.620]  What about a different computer?
[16:36.720 --> 16:38.480]  Can you try it while we're in the office?
[16:39.060 --> 16:39.740]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[16:39.740 --> 16:40.140]  Okay.
[16:42.700 --> 16:45.060]  So did these guys not pay off their debt or they did?
[16:45.160 --> 16:47.920]  Because they just came in here, laid down and now we're getting up and leaving.
[16:48.720 --> 16:49.900]  And they left the bread.
[16:50.260 --> 16:51.420]  No, the bread.
[16:51.620 --> 16:52.280]  It's on the bed.
[16:52.960 --> 16:53.560]  No, the bed.
[17:01.960 --> 17:05.020]  There you go. Thanks for the sub, VeryGoodGames.
[17:11.200 --> 17:13.780]  Who is wasting my fucking time?
[17:17.320 --> 17:19.660]  Federico's crew has not returned from the new deposit.
[17:20.240 --> 17:21.220]  Something's not right.
[17:22.280 --> 17:23.440]  So sorry to hear that.
[17:24.120 --> 17:25.780]  I'll remember to say a prayer for them.
[17:26.400 --> 17:28.080]  I don't think he's...
[17:30.340 --> 17:31.980]  Somebody asked why we're not streaming...
[17:34.220 --> 17:38.280]  Somebody asked why we're not streaming Battlefield 6 right now because there's no mafia in Battlefield 6.
[17:38.440 --> 17:38.600]  It's true.
[17:39.740 --> 17:41.380]  Until the mafia is in it, we can't play it.
[17:42.500 --> 17:44.740]  I think there's a demo out maybe or the beta's out.
[17:48.420 --> 17:51.160]  Is Battlefield good? I don't think I've played any Battlefield games.
[17:53.120 --> 17:54.540]  The last few haven't.
[17:55.040 --> 17:56.560]  I thought the last one was real good.
[17:56.700 --> 18:00.020]  They do big map battles very well.
[18:01.540 --> 18:04.560]  I think you can ride a tank and then get into a jet.
[18:04.740 --> 18:06.540]  I think that's all I really know about those games.
[18:07.360 --> 18:12.340]  I think the last one I had the most fun in was probably Bad Company 2, whenever that came out.
[18:12.480 --> 18:13.100]  That's a perfect game.
[18:14.180 --> 18:20.440]  But I got really into the most recent Battlefield with Burndog and Antonio and it won me over after a while.
[18:20.520 --> 18:20.960]  It's real good.
[18:21.320 --> 18:23.780]  Do you think you and the truck boys will play some 6?
[18:24.280 --> 18:24.640]  Absolutely.
[18:26.560 --> 18:27.160]  Do you want to play?
[18:30.300 --> 18:32.380]  Let's play Sea of Thieves. Let's play whatever.
[18:33.080 --> 18:34.120]  Are you going to call more trucks?
[18:35.580 --> 18:36.220]  Gun trucks.
[18:40.880 --> 18:43.120]  We spent a lot of time in this fucking cave.
[18:43.900 --> 18:44.780]  Don't worry, we're back.
[18:45.480 --> 18:47.940]  It's like if the beginning of Starfield was the whole game.
[18:50.400 --> 18:58.140]  I think a big problem in media that I have right now is that everything has to give me a prologue and nothing can get to the point.
[18:58.140 --> 19:04.880]  It's like I don't really care about this. I care about what we're doing and this isn't what we're doing.
[19:05.640 --> 19:10.060]  Every game is just walking for the first 45 minutes.
[19:10.220 --> 19:13.240]  That's why I like Donkey Kong so much because you just start smashing straight away.
[19:13.240 --> 19:20.660]  Boy, you just start and it felt like... I felt like I was doing something wrong in Donkey Kong because I went there's no way this is what it's supposed to be and it is and it's great.
[19:22.360 --> 19:23.320]  You finished Donkey Kong yet?
[19:23.680 --> 19:26.940]  No, I think I'm very close. I think I'm right near the end.
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.140]  I'm on rehearsals.
[19:32.820 --> 19:36.480]  Yeah, I got... I'm done with the story, got all the bananas.
[19:37.040 --> 19:37.440]  Nice.
[19:37.900 --> 19:39.000]  Got every banana?
[19:39.580 --> 19:39.780]  Yep.
[19:40.340 --> 19:41.260]  Holy shit.
[19:43.060 --> 19:44.580]  I think Jordan Spears did that in Odyssey.
[19:44.920 --> 19:46.400]  I think Jordan Spears just did that.
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.500]  What are you going to do with all those bananas?
[19:49.980 --> 19:52.480]  I guess buy more bananas.
[19:52.880 --> 20:01.880]  Like, there's a cap. You can just endlessly buy bananas and if you collect all the 777, it's still not enough to fully upgrade all your skill points.
[20:02.040 --> 20:02.200]  Oh, wow.
[20:02.840 --> 20:04.820]  I might be buying.
[20:05.440 --> 20:07.620]  Do you need like that little chip tone guy to give you the...
[20:08.580 --> 20:09.060]  Yeah.
[20:09.480 --> 20:10.520]  The infinite amount of bananas?
[20:10.980 --> 20:13.120]  Yeah, you need like over a hundred from him.
[20:13.820 --> 20:14.540]  Wow, really?
[20:15.960 --> 20:21.020]  Yeah, but they're not... they don't count as far as like what they consider to be all the bananas.
[20:21.800 --> 20:24.500]  They don't go to your total number, but they go to your skills?
[20:25.680 --> 20:26.080]  Yeah.
[20:26.640 --> 20:27.240]  Thank you, Epsilon.
[20:28.460 --> 20:34.500]  They have like a banana thing that says like 700 out of... like 777 out of 777, but then you can just go above that.
[20:35.120 --> 20:35.360]  Wow.
[20:37.460 --> 20:39.800]  Yeah, I feel like I bought some extra moons in Odyssey.
[20:41.440 --> 20:44.120]  Guys, this is the deepest mine. It's about to get real exciting.
[20:45.260 --> 20:48.300]  I think we could go deeper. Donkey Kong would make it so much deeper than this.
[20:48.760 --> 20:49.900]  Donkey Kong wouldn't stop.
[20:50.900 --> 20:54.180]  That was a very fast fall. Holy shit.
[20:54.400 --> 20:56.500]  That wouldn't scare Donkey Kong and he would dig deeper.
[20:57.820 --> 20:59.420]  And then he would get mad and start digging up.
[21:00.520 --> 21:01.560]  Powerfully he'd dig up.
[21:03.500 --> 21:10.380]  I think if he's going to find... I think maybe the ancient sword of Mafia and when he touches it, he'll be imbued with Mafia.
[21:14.150 --> 21:16.990]  The ancient sword of Mafia.
[21:17.530 --> 21:20.530]  Now imagine a Graboid shoots out of the wall right now.
[21:20.670 --> 21:22.130]  That's what I'm talking about, dude. Yeah.
[21:29.850 --> 21:32.010]  Jim Lovell died.
[21:36.930 --> 21:37.470]  97.
[21:37.470 --> 21:37.770]  97.
[21:41.690 --> 21:49.270]  Obviously, I'm a big fan of Jim, but for those of us who don't know, like Eric, who's Jim Lovell?
[21:50.550 --> 21:51.550]  Apollo 13 astronaut.
[21:52.330 --> 21:53.010]  That's right.
[21:53.870 --> 21:54.910]  That's right.
[22:00.910 --> 22:02.150]  Tom Hanks in the movie.
[22:12.270 --> 22:13.850]  Oh, no. The game started.
[22:17.410 --> 22:20.090]  Something's finally happening in the game. Run away from it.
[22:20.550 --> 22:23.610]  If the game started with this sequence, would we be mad? I think this would be better.
[22:23.850 --> 22:24.910]  I think this would be way better.
[22:29.430 --> 22:35.230]  And then while they're squeezing through, they could just throw some dialogue that's like, remember when we were in a room and we all ate bread? Yeah.
[22:35.950 --> 22:37.030]  That was crazy, right?
[22:37.190 --> 22:38.330]  All right. Anyway, let's go up this ladder.
[22:38.330 --> 22:40.590]  Hey, remember that shrine? All right, let's keep running.
[22:57.260 --> 23:01.280]  Errol has beef with the beginning of games. That sounds like a new show. Errol has beef.
[23:02.980 --> 23:06.240]  I do have beef. I think so many games are just pants.
[23:07.820 --> 23:11.740]  Hit him with an E-bomb, Errol.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.440]  There's that tweet where that guy said, back in the day, if you had a TV show called Surf Dracula,
[23:19.440 --> 23:22.740]  you'd see that guy surfing every week in New Adventures.
[23:23.020 --> 23:28.660]  But in the streaming era, the entire first season is going to be a long-ass flashback about how he got his surfboard
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.980]  until you finally see him surf in the five-minute finale.
[23:31.860 --> 23:37.200]  And that is truly the state we're in.
[23:42.300 --> 23:45.460]  That's maybe the best point I've heard made this year.
[23:46.480 --> 23:47.480]  It's definitely like...
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.340]  Eight episodes of waiting for Dracula to surf. Absolutely cliffhanger.
[23:52.960 --> 23:53.500]  Point of the year.
[23:53.960 --> 23:55.260]  Back in two and a half years.
[23:56.440 --> 23:58.860]  That's why Superman kind of gets right to it.
[24:03.720 --> 24:08.780]  Yeah, well, it's because people don't know how to tell a story in 90 minutes,
[24:08.900 --> 24:10.820]  so when you give them nine episodes, they make it worse.
[24:15.460 --> 24:20.340]  Oh my God! Is... Did you... Are... Are we still... Is this the same thing?
[24:21.300 --> 24:21.940]  What do you mean?
[24:22.120 --> 24:22.380]  He died.
[24:22.740 --> 24:23.260]  Did you die?
[24:23.440 --> 24:27.440]  No, I didn't die. I, like, broke... Like, the thing broke. I fell over, and then I... I kept going.
[24:28.300 --> 24:28.460]  Oh.
[24:29.060 --> 24:30.420]  Oh, so this is...
[24:30.420 --> 24:31.080]  So this is the same thing.
[24:31.080 --> 24:32.200]  This is the same sequence.
[24:32.780 --> 24:33.580]  Okay, thank you.
[24:35.560 --> 24:37.820]  Crazy. It's crazy that you did it again.
[24:38.780 --> 24:39.380]  Minkia!
[24:40.160 --> 24:40.760]  Demoni!
[24:41.440 --> 24:43.240]  Forget it! We need to go!
[24:44.780 --> 24:46.060]  He's gonna die!
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.120]  The sucky thing about Vampire Dracula 2 is that it doesn't get picked up for a third season,
[24:52.260 --> 24:59.820]  so, like, 100,000 people have to mail, like, wax Dracula teeth to the network to, you know, fucking...
[25:01.220 --> 25:05.640]  cut the budget by 80% and let them make four of the eight episodes.
[25:06.080 --> 25:06.240]  Yep.
[25:07.820 --> 25:09.400]  He ain't gonna be in Surf Dracula 2.
[25:13.500 --> 25:16.920]  I want to thank Grunkfunkle for the prime sub. Thank you, Grunkfunkle.
[25:17.000 --> 25:17.940]  Hell yeah, Grunkfunkle.
[25:20.440 --> 25:23.520]  And Grunkfunkle also gifted 10. Grunkfunkle coming through big style.
[25:23.940 --> 25:29.360]  Do you think they would have been more or less successful if the band was named Simon and Grunkfunkle?
[25:30.300 --> 25:31.900]  Oh man, I would love them way more.
[25:32.380 --> 25:36.240]  I think they would have been more popular. It's got a way better ring to it.
[25:39.360 --> 25:42.840]  I just like to hear that Simon and Grunkfunkle are really meeting.
[25:51.310 --> 25:52.530]  What happened out here?
[25:55.130 --> 25:58.770]  There's a bunch of dudes laying... making out with each other on the ground.
[26:01.690 --> 26:05.150]  I think somebody's gonna die. I think your guy is about to kill somebody.
[26:07.450 --> 26:09.390]  Prepare to learn the fighting mechanics, Andrew.
[26:09.930 --> 26:10.510]  I'm ready.
[26:11.670 --> 26:14.250]  Stab, stab, stab. Upwards, upwards, upwards.
[26:19.390 --> 26:23.030]  That was an Italian student English.
[26:24.370 --> 26:25.170]  What does that mean?
[26:32.100 --> 26:33.160]  Here we go.
[26:38.260 --> 26:39.900]  Do you firestorm in?
[26:40.200 --> 26:42.100]  I thought he had like a bull whip.
[26:45.480 --> 26:46.920]  I think he killed the monk.
[26:51.580 --> 26:55.420]  He's still going though.
[27:05.620 --> 27:10.560]  I don't think I'm supposed to be able to get him stuck in that corner like I did.
[27:10.900 --> 27:13.060]  You stabbed him so many times.
[27:13.060 --> 27:16.840]  He's essentially... you could pull him apart like he was perforated.
[27:19.480 --> 27:22.480]  Don't talk to me like that.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.040]  Alright, kill this fool.
[27:28.200 --> 27:28.840]  There we go.
[27:33.100 --> 27:37.620]  Uh oh. Uh oh.
[27:39.040 --> 27:39.780]  Now we're good.
[27:43.060 --> 27:44.060]  Back to it.
[27:46.880 --> 27:48.360]  His health recharges.
[27:48.900 --> 27:50.380]  Yeah, you gotta dodge.
[27:53.060 --> 27:54.800]  He coagulates between rounds.
[27:55.340 --> 27:56.560]  He might be Serf Dracula.
[27:58.580 --> 28:00.200]  It'd be bright outside for Serf Dracula.
[28:01.200 --> 28:03.200]  We don't know how Serf Dracula operates.
[28:04.040 --> 28:05.280]  That's true. Uh oh.
[28:09.500 --> 28:12.280]  Maybe the winner of this fight gets to play the game.
[28:13.060 --> 28:14.250]  Don't be so sure.
[28:17.220 --> 28:17.920]  Yeah!
[28:24.600 --> 28:26.240]  What does that mean?
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.620]  Thanks for showing up, Mose Nose.
[28:39.980 --> 28:40.680]  Run!
[28:46.520 --> 28:47.200]  A horse!
[28:47.680 --> 28:50.100]  Hit the horse button!
[28:50.220 --> 28:50.600]  Stab the horse!
[28:51.080 --> 28:52.500]  Oh yeah, get on the horse. That's better.
[28:53.540 --> 28:55.600]  Andrew, what do you name your horses typically in games?
[28:56.760 --> 28:58.140]  Uh... horses in games?
[28:58.940 --> 29:01.920]  Like, did you name your horse in Red Dead or anything like that?
[29:02.460 --> 29:05.380]  What did I name my horse in Red Dead? Maybe Trottlesworth?
[29:08.280 --> 29:09.080]  That's interesting.
[29:10.640 --> 29:11.640]  Likes to trot.
[29:12.420 --> 29:13.220]  What about you, Gavin?
[29:13.220 --> 29:15.660]  I don't know what I named my horse.
[29:16.040 --> 29:18.140]  I named my horse Clyde.
[29:18.700 --> 29:20.260]  That seems like what you would name a horse.
[29:20.820 --> 29:24.860]  I think I named one Spiders, and then I named another one Ravioli.
[29:25.420 --> 29:27.580]  That was, uh... yeah.
[29:28.020 --> 29:31.700]  Sometimes you just have to take inspiration from what's around you.
[29:32.520 --> 29:35.520]  I always name my horse Mystery after SpongeBob's horse.
[29:38.080 --> 29:39.500]  Never got into SpongeBob.
[29:39.840 --> 29:40.300]  Me neither.
[29:40.300 --> 29:47.820]  My kid was the age, so that's why I watched a whole lot of SpongeBob.
[29:47.840 --> 29:51.480]  I also was the age, but it just didn't connect, which is unfortunate.
[29:52.280 --> 29:52.560]  Same.
[29:54.740 --> 29:56.460]  There's a shotgun in your lemons!
[29:57.640 --> 29:58.820]  You got an achievement for that.
[30:00.080 --> 30:02.000]  There's epic music playing. I muted the music.
[30:02.120 --> 30:05.000]  Oh, okay, Clyde. I wasn't sure if there'd be anything licensed, so that is why.
[30:05.260 --> 30:08.780]  The plaque says, Goulash is my go-to horse name.
[30:10.300 --> 30:10.500]  Haha.
[30:15.000 --> 30:15.440]  Tino.
[30:16.900 --> 30:18.320]  I'm afraid not, Tino.
[30:19.120 --> 30:20.240]  Tino Turner.
[30:24.420 --> 30:25.440]  You skip this?
[30:31.140 --> 30:33.260]  Is that what it's playing?
[30:33.620 --> 30:34.820]  It is, yeah.
[30:38.300 --> 30:42.160]  Why did that fish just talk like pussy?
[30:43.440 --> 30:45.140]  That's what that bell was doing.
[30:48.780 --> 30:50.240]  Poor kill is a good name.
[30:50.900 --> 30:51.760]  Oh, Christ.
[30:52.100 --> 30:54.160]  Who was your friend, the one that, uh, booty?
[30:54.520 --> 30:54.920]  Pussy!
[30:59.980 --> 31:01.220]  Trottlesworth, take me home.
[31:02.940 --> 31:05.280]  They're demolishing the MLK bridge at 35?
[31:07.180 --> 31:09.000]  Yeah. Are they doing it today?
[31:09.380 --> 31:10.800]  Uh, Saturday, it looks like.
[31:11.500 --> 31:12.620]  Yeah, they do it pretty soon.
[31:12.620 --> 31:12.800]  Saturday.
[31:14.120 --> 31:15.040]  Will it blow it up?
[31:15.540 --> 31:16.100]  I guess so.
[31:18.880 --> 31:24.480]  We gotta make a new one. Gotta make room for the 10-year interstate expansion project that we're under now.
[31:24.580 --> 31:25.680]  And it should be so fast.
[31:25.760 --> 31:29.080]  That we just lost $150 million of federal funding for.
[31:29.200 --> 31:31.100]  Yeah, it should be pretty quick. Don't worry about it.
[31:32.320 --> 31:37.880]  So now they're, uh, gotta figure out what to do with the project, because they just lost a significant portion of the revenue that was supposed to pay for it.
[31:39.220 --> 31:43.560]  Luckily, we've already started and done way too much work on it to stop now.
[31:46.660 --> 31:49.380]  When you're already deep, just keep digging down, baby.
[31:49.760 --> 31:50.500]  That's right.
[31:51.420 --> 31:52.680]  Donkey Kong's still in the hole.
[31:55.380 --> 31:56.300]  I carumba?
[31:59.800 --> 32:06.800]  Okay, use your detective mode.
[32:09.140 --> 32:10.560]  You have eagle vision?
[32:11.040 --> 32:11.280]  Yeah.
[32:13.100 --> 32:13.900]  There you go.
[32:14.360 --> 32:15.460]  God, it is Assassin's Creed.
[32:15.720 --> 32:17.540]  Yeah. This game is derogatory to rats.
[32:21.480 --> 32:24.680]  Where am I supposed to go?
[32:26.380 --> 32:29.940]  Oh yeah, just to keep you guys updated, my Snoopy has evolved into Woodstock, so...
[32:30.860 --> 32:31.740]  Oh, nice!
[32:32.060 --> 32:33.160]  Was it supposed to do that?
[32:33.440 --> 32:37.080]  Uh, he can. He has many different outfits, and then sometimes Woodstock or Harriet show up.
[32:37.700 --> 32:38.320]  Oh, okay.
[32:38.660 --> 32:39.740]  Well, congratulations then.
[32:39.880 --> 32:40.640]  Thank you. Thank you so much.
[32:41.660 --> 32:45.000]  Are we gonna play Borderlands 4? I assume so.
[32:45.200 --> 32:45.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[32:45.740 --> 32:47.780]  I assume we'll probably do a couple of gameplays in it.
[32:47.960 --> 32:50.720]  I'm gonna play it regardless, so yeah, I hope so.
[32:51.460 --> 32:53.620]  Sounds like Gavin's a no, but maybe the rest of us will.
[32:55.480 --> 32:59.960]  Maybe we should do a playthrough on Borderlands on the hardest difficulty or something, if it has one. I don't know.
[33:01.540 --> 33:02.800]  Andrew, please go kill that guy.
[33:05.420 --> 33:06.980]  He's gonna kill you if you don't kill him.
[33:06.980 --> 33:08.060]  I'm not begging you.
[33:11.240 --> 33:12.040]  Oh, Choco.
[33:13.340 --> 33:16.240]  Use your little paws. Use your little paws.
[33:16.420 --> 33:18.420]  I'm gonna get that tattooed on my neck.
[33:22.020 --> 33:23.080]  What about your inner lip?
[33:23.580 --> 33:25.240]  No, that's a different one.
[33:27.700 --> 33:29.260]  Oh, hell yeah, dude. You got a whetstone.
[33:31.460 --> 33:33.820]  Will we get more limbo? You'll definitely get more limbo.
[33:34.240 --> 33:34.580]  Oh, yeah.
[33:35.300 --> 33:37.200]  You see how far he got last time, dude? It was pretty cool.
[33:38.240 --> 33:40.860]  I think the next time I limbo, I'm gonna start a little bit earlier in the day.
[33:41.560 --> 33:42.740]  Like, really go for it, huh?
[33:43.580 --> 33:45.540]  Yeah, I'll just go beyond 501.
[33:45.740 --> 33:46.020]  Okay.
[33:46.620 --> 33:47.380]  I'm down with that.
[33:47.800 --> 33:49.980]  I'm making, like, little baby step progress.
[33:50.140 --> 33:52.520]  I think you're doing great. I think you're doing great with it so far.
[33:53.420 --> 33:54.200]  Use your bat vision.
[34:04.370 --> 34:05.710]  I can feel my wings.
[34:07.110 --> 34:07.550]  Gunkalus.
[34:10.130 --> 34:10.570]  Gunkatus.
[34:11.070 --> 34:11.670]  What does it say?
[34:12.210 --> 34:15.090]  It says, is this on the calendar? Yes, it is.
[34:16.730 --> 34:18.710]  The 4pm, 501.
[34:27.870 --> 34:29.550]  Do we knife him or choke him?
[34:29.830 --> 34:30.810]  Let's try knife him this time.
[34:32.250 --> 34:33.550]  You gotta use your little paws.
[34:37.470 --> 34:40.110]  Maybe when I feel confident that I can do the limbo achievement,
[34:40.470 --> 34:42.050]  and I'm, like, about to do the run,
[34:42.850 --> 34:44.030]  maybe we can all do it together.
[34:45.350 --> 34:46.030]  What does that mean?
[34:46.730 --> 34:47.210]  What does that mean?
[34:47.350 --> 34:48.350]  Well, that's what Andrew said.
[34:48.390 --> 34:51.110]  He was just gonna play, like, 10 seconds behind me to learn.
[34:52.150 --> 34:53.610]  Yeah, that's my plan still.
[34:53.890 --> 34:54.330]  That's so smart.
[34:54.330 --> 34:56.170]  So we should just do it with the chat as well.
[34:58.190 --> 34:59.810]  See if the chat wants to jump on also.
[34:59.910 --> 35:01.190]  They can just play 10 seconds behind you.
[35:02.110 --> 35:02.430]  Yeah.
[35:02.430 --> 35:03.110]  Woo!
[35:12.370 --> 35:17.110]  I used to have so much fun with those things in Assassin's Creed multiplayer.
[35:17.910 --> 35:18.770]  With what things?
[35:19.190 --> 35:20.450]  Those bales of hay.
[35:20.650 --> 35:20.990]  Oh.
[35:21.090 --> 35:22.130]  You could hide into them.
[35:22.490 --> 35:24.690]  There was this complicated sequence of things I could do
[35:24.690 --> 35:27.530]  to piss off but not kill an enemy,
[35:27.730 --> 35:28.770]  and he could never fight back.
[35:29.230 --> 35:30.090]  He'd keep going.
[35:30.790 --> 35:32.050]  Right hook him and then...
[35:32.050 --> 35:32.910]  Run off.
[35:34.030 --> 35:37.090]  And then trap the thing so when he comes in he gets bombed.
[35:37.990 --> 35:40.250]  Front of the cream line, thanks for the five gifted subs.
[35:43.310 --> 35:44.470]  I want this hat.
[35:44.990 --> 35:46.370]  I want this hat real bad.
[35:46.490 --> 35:47.290]  Give me this hat.
[35:49.570 --> 35:51.570]  Yankee Doodle-ass hat, dude. Take it.
[35:52.530 --> 35:56.350]  Speaking of Yankee Doodle, thanks front of the cream line for the subs.
[35:56.530 --> 35:57.010]  Thank you so much.
[35:58.150 --> 36:00.390]  Hey, thanks front of the cream line for the subs.
[36:00.390 --> 36:04.210]  Hey, just want to give a shout out to front of the cream line for those subs.
[36:04.350 --> 36:05.430]  Thank you so much.
[36:07.610 --> 36:09.530]  Gavin's more of a back of the cream line guy.
[36:11.790 --> 36:13.890]  Gavin can't even finish tying his shoes.
[36:14.710 --> 36:16.210]  I don't have any laces.
[36:16.550 --> 36:18.430]  Uh oh, this guy's back.
[36:18.630 --> 36:20.570]  Oh hey, thanks front of the cream line for the subs.
[36:25.770 --> 36:28.970]  While this is going on, there's a guy choked out in a bale of hay.
[36:28.970 --> 36:34.110]  Oh, I like the little butthole heart that Mockingbird has there.
[36:35.490 --> 36:35.850]  Cute.
[36:36.630 --> 36:39.250]  That would be a good start to a game if you woke up in a bale of hay.
[36:40.490 --> 36:41.290]  It would be pretty good.
[36:42.750 --> 36:43.770]  Like you were the needle?
[36:44.510 --> 36:45.730]  Just in the Assassin's Creed universe.
[36:49.990 --> 36:52.250]  Is the hay stack the same as the hay bale?
[36:54.250 --> 36:55.870]  Isn't the stack a ton of bales?
[36:56.610 --> 36:57.390]  I guess so.
[36:57.390 --> 36:58.990]  Maybe there's like a twine element.
[37:02.690 --> 37:05.170]  A lot of people are going crazy with the butthole hearts.
[37:05.550 --> 37:05.990]  Love it.
[37:08.070 --> 37:09.190]  That would be a cool game.
[37:09.590 --> 37:13.470]  There should be an Assassin's Creed game where you're just like a little street rat kid.
[37:13.590 --> 37:16.510]  Like think of a young Eric, and you're sleeping in a bale of hay,
[37:16.790 --> 37:18.410]  eating like a stolen apple,
[37:18.670 --> 37:22.150]  and then like an assassin drops into it and then runs off and you see him,
[37:22.150 --> 37:23.050]  and then you follow him,
[37:23.150 --> 37:27.170]  and then you slowly become like a ragtag pseudo-assassin, you know?
[37:29.270 --> 37:30.710]  But it's like Ezio.
[37:31.690 --> 37:33.990]  It's kind of like what they did with the Ender's Game series eventually,
[37:34.130 --> 37:36.550]  where it's like you're watching Ezio run around,
[37:36.710 --> 37:38.090]  but you're just like some little turd, you know?
[37:39.410 --> 37:40.350]  Once again, think Eric.
[37:40.570 --> 37:40.890]  Thanks, man.
[37:41.670 --> 37:42.270]  No problem.
[37:44.050 --> 37:45.050]  Gotta get one of these hats.
[37:51.940 --> 37:54.080]  That's a very good looking character model.
[37:54.080 --> 37:57.300]  That looks graphically ugly.
[37:57.340 --> 37:58.760]  Like he's sexy, or it looks really real?
[37:59.140 --> 38:00.240]  Yeah, why don't you marry him?
[38:00.500 --> 38:02.040]  Graphically, why don't you make out with him?
[38:02.820 --> 38:04.400]  His shirt looks really good, too.
[38:04.680 --> 38:08.260]  Yeah, his shirt looks awesome, and I feel like his shirt looks even better.
[38:09.780 --> 38:12.860]  You can tell he works out.
[38:12.940 --> 38:13.880]  Only one way to find out.
[38:17.180 --> 38:18.540]  That's go muscle, not show muscle.
[38:21.360 --> 38:25.500]  It's a weird detail to notice, but the buttons look great on all these clothing items.
[38:25.640 --> 38:26.560]  That is a weird detail.
[38:26.560 --> 38:27.200]  They look very realistic.
[38:29.900 --> 38:30.960]  Ray-traced buttons.
[38:31.660 --> 38:31.900]  Yeah.
[38:34.240 --> 38:36.240]  They're so small, you could make them in 8K.
[38:49.460 --> 38:51.800]  I'm really sad that with the switch to Nintendo,
[38:51.940 --> 38:54.820]  they didn't double down on HD rumble and make it like 8K rumble.
[38:56.940 --> 38:57.700]  Dude.
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.300]  Speaking of rumble...
[39:01.300 --> 39:07.240]  We moved the pinball machine into a different room yesterday.
[39:08.300 --> 39:11.040]  Into the same room as the guillotine.
[39:11.840 --> 39:17.660]  And the floor under the pinball machine in that room is not as secure.
[39:18.160 --> 39:20.780]  That shakes the whole fucking room now.
[39:20.780 --> 39:25.460]  When you get an Earthshaker bonus, the entire room shakes.
[39:25.640 --> 39:26.480]  That's incredible.
[39:29.770 --> 39:32.990]  Is there like a Geiger counter app you can get?
[39:34.510 --> 39:35.250]  Not a Geiger counter.
[39:36.130 --> 39:37.190]  I know what you mean.
[39:39.890 --> 39:41.370]  The seismograph or whatever it's called.
[39:41.470 --> 39:44.670]  I mean, we can see what radiation it's throwing off, but I can't imagine it's very much.
[39:48.310 --> 39:50.410]  Geiger counter is just vibrating.
[39:51.590 --> 39:53.330]  Yeah, still at zero, guys.
[40:03.610 --> 40:06.450]  Who's the best at pinball besides Gavin? I don't even have the high score on this.
[40:07.130 --> 40:08.230]  Who has the 5 million?
[40:08.790 --> 40:10.270]  I do right now.
[40:11.550 --> 40:12.590]  It's anybody's game.
[40:13.490 --> 40:15.890]  Now that we have it going the right speed.
[40:16.350 --> 40:17.950]  I haven't played it since we moved it.
[40:18.470 --> 40:19.390]  We leveled it.
[40:20.410 --> 40:24.910]  It was at 5 degrees previously, now it's at 6, the appropriate degree, I guess.
[40:25.050 --> 40:25.510]  So we'll see.
[40:25.890 --> 40:32.410]  We should see if I wear headphones on Discord and play pinball and Andrew just says left or right.
[40:32.750 --> 40:34.070]  We can see if Andrew goes left.
[40:39.630 --> 40:40.830]  I think we did.
[40:51.390 --> 40:53.730]  I do like the idea of blindfolded pinball, though.
[40:54.770 --> 40:55.510]  Teams with teams.
[40:56.310 --> 40:58.010]  Wasn't there a whole rock opera about that?
[41:02.530 --> 41:15.730]  Man, being in the Mafia is a lot different than I thought it would be.
[41:16.230 --> 41:19.670]  Yeah, I've been watching too much Sopranos. I'm getting the wrong idea.
[41:23.310 --> 41:24.010]  Is it open?
[41:24.770 --> 41:27.730]  No, but I just like what happens if I get it?
[41:27.790 --> 41:31.270]  I was going to say, I have a feeling this is the kind of game that goes like you're not supposed to be over here.
[41:32.050 --> 41:33.110]  Go, go, go, go.
[41:33.630 --> 41:34.370]  I'm coming, Luca.
[41:36.610 --> 41:40.750]  You can put tags in the stream and I keep it generally keep it the same.
[41:40.810 --> 41:43.390]  But this time I put in Tony Soprano as one of our guys.
[41:46.170 --> 41:47.870]  You see those vines in the fields?
[41:49.190 --> 41:50.690]  Eventually, the grapes will become.
[41:50.690 --> 41:51.530]  What was that?
[41:53.570 --> 41:55.730]  Sorry, I had a friend who sent me a thing.
[41:55.750 --> 42:01.970]  He's in the calendar crew for the firefighters.
[42:02.450 --> 42:04.290]  That's the banana ball thing.
[42:05.730 --> 42:07.150]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:07.150 --> 42:09.350]  He sent me a video of something he'd done recently.
[42:11.270 --> 42:14.410]  Did you guys see that guy from the banana ball who did the front flip on CNN?
[42:15.150 --> 42:17.430]  What? Wait, was that a banana ball guy?
[42:18.070 --> 42:18.370]  Yeah.
[42:18.550 --> 42:19.110]  No way!
[42:19.110 --> 42:21.870]  That horse's mouth is up that horse's ass.
[42:23.910 --> 42:25.870]  That's how that guy felt after he did that front flip.
[42:26.450 --> 42:27.650]  Those horses are loved.
[42:32.630 --> 42:35.030]  Shame Gavin can't see the calendar crew.
[42:36.910 --> 42:38.890]  Gaspari will look after your horse while you're here.
[42:41.810 --> 42:42.550]  Ciao, Gaspari.
[42:42.810 --> 42:44.610]  You left early in a rush.
[42:45.290 --> 42:46.410]  Horse centipede.
[42:46.410 --> 42:47.550]  It's fine.
[42:48.150 --> 42:50.630]  Just a few unexpected visitors.
[42:55.150 --> 42:58.650]  Skrrt, X2 just said mailman just dropped off the Gurpler.
[42:58.790 --> 42:59.510]  This thing is vibrant.
[42:59.790 --> 42:59.990]  Hell yeah.
[43:00.650 --> 43:01.530]  Hell yeah.
[43:02.010 --> 43:04.030]  I'm seeing lots of Gurplers arriving today.
[43:04.090 --> 43:04.310]  Oh yeah.
[43:04.850 --> 43:05.350]  It's weird.
[43:06.370 --> 43:08.970]  But don't go poking around or you'll find yourself in trouble.
[43:09.450 --> 43:10.290]  It's a beautiful cup.
[43:10.830 --> 43:13.050]  Genuinely, it's my favorite Gurpler.
[43:14.410 --> 43:17.750]  Just remember, with great Gurpler comes great responsibility.
[43:18.430 --> 43:18.990]  Use it well.
[43:19.450 --> 43:21.750]  I believe those were Stan Lee's last words.
[43:22.210 --> 43:22.650]  That's true.
[43:23.190 --> 43:24.070]  I thought it was Kurt Russell.
[43:25.410 --> 43:26.370]  He's still alive.
[43:29.560 --> 43:31.000]  We gotta get Kurt Russell a Gurpler.
[43:34.920 --> 43:36.820]  What the fuck is this?
[43:36.920 --> 43:37.940]  Ah, it's a cup from a podcast.
[43:41.160 --> 43:42.940]  It's probably easier than you think.
[43:44.420 --> 43:45.120]  You get some rest.
[43:45.600 --> 43:47.040]  I'll be back later to talk about work.
[43:55.050 --> 43:56.630]  Is the game gonna begin?
[43:57.830 --> 43:58.870]  You fucking wish.
[43:59.490 --> 44:00.350]  Go do horse chores.
[44:01.750 --> 44:02.610]  How about a cutscene?
[44:03.510 --> 44:04.750]  Mafia horse chores?
[44:09.170 --> 44:11.630]  Wake up, I'm gonna be mean to you.
[44:16.980 --> 44:19.640]  You're like a mob doctor, but it's just for horses.
[44:19.640 --> 44:24.380]  Your character looks like the character from that Star Wars game.
[44:25.680 --> 44:26.760]  Oh, I can see that.
[44:28.420 --> 44:30.140]  Is he good or bad one?
[44:30.280 --> 44:31.760]  Yeah, he looks exactly like that guy.
[44:32.980 --> 44:34.900]  Darth Itches or whatever the fuck. Starkiller.
[44:38.820 --> 44:40.120]  Starkiller. Yeah, that's his name.
[44:41.260 --> 44:43.060]  Thank you who let the rats out.
[44:49.610 --> 44:51.310]  This is why I don't play games.
[44:51.310 --> 44:54.330]  Nothing is happening. I'm watching them watching nothing happen.
[44:55.110 --> 44:56.710]  We're on video games, baby.
[45:02.950 --> 45:05.290]  Candy desk official. Holy shit.
[45:05.650 --> 45:07.790]  Thank you so much, candy desk.
[45:10.110 --> 45:12.010]  Candy desk, that would be delicious.
[45:12.310 --> 45:13.270]  Have you guys...
[45:13.270 --> 45:16.350]  Thanks, front of the cream line for those five gifts.
[45:16.470 --> 45:17.710]  Thank you so much.
[45:18.370 --> 45:19.170]  Thank you so much.
[45:19.250 --> 45:19.850]  Oh, charcoal rust.
[45:20.210 --> 45:22.570]  Yeah, charcoal rust, definitely.
[45:22.710 --> 45:22.950]  Charcoal.
[45:23.510 --> 45:24.810]  Oh, I don't have a candle.
[45:25.330 --> 45:26.810]  The princess for Kovala? Damn.
[45:28.950 --> 45:30.190]  Have you guys seen any of those...
[45:30.190 --> 45:31.130]  Speaking of candy desk.
[45:31.230 --> 45:32.790]  Have you guys seen any of those TikToks?
[45:32.810 --> 45:34.530]  I know you haven't, Gavin, but people that use it.
[45:35.050 --> 45:36.950]  Those AI TikToks that are like...
[45:36.950 --> 45:40.950]  What bed is associated with your month?
[45:41.090 --> 45:41.710]  And it's like January.
[45:42.150 --> 45:43.530]  It's the cloud bed.
[45:43.610 --> 45:45.790]  And February is the marshmallow bed.
[45:46.510 --> 45:48.610]  That's some fucking weird content.
[45:49.130 --> 45:49.330]  What?
[45:49.970 --> 45:50.730]  No, I don't...
[45:50.730 --> 45:51.110]  You've never seen it, Gavin?
[45:51.110 --> 45:51.890]  I don't have that.
[45:52.030 --> 45:56.790]  They'll be like, March is a scab bed and April is chicken cutlet bed.
[45:57.010 --> 46:00.470]  And then it'd be like somebody crawling into a bed made out of chicken cutlets.
[46:00.570 --> 46:01.230]  And it's like all like...
[46:01.930 --> 46:02.410]  Gross.
[46:04.550 --> 46:05.030]  AI.
[46:06.290 --> 46:09.290]  Speaking of candy, I got push pop gummies.
[46:09.790 --> 46:11.790]  The gummy itself, very average.
[46:12.690 --> 46:15.250]  Really fun mechanism for getting the gummy out.
[46:15.570 --> 46:15.870]  Oh, really?
[46:16.630 --> 46:24.890]  Yeah, they do the push pop thing where you lift it up and then you like cock it, essentially, and the candy shoots up from it.
[46:25.090 --> 46:27.150]  Like the platform pulls it to the top.
[46:27.550 --> 46:27.670]  Huh.
[46:28.030 --> 46:29.250]  It's very fun.
[46:30.650 --> 46:33.470]  It feels like a thing that you would very much enjoy using, Jack.
[46:34.670 --> 46:35.870]  I want to try it.
[46:36.730 --> 46:38.910]  I feel like I would like an ice cream bed.
[46:39.850 --> 46:41.050]  Oh, that's a good one.
[46:42.250 --> 46:43.390]  Keep me cool in the summer.
[46:43.750 --> 46:43.970]  Yeah.
[46:44.790 --> 46:47.250]  Then you get your hair all over it.
[46:47.870 --> 46:49.570]  Ah, can I have a shower every morning?
[46:50.290 --> 46:52.570]  Yeah, but hair's gonna fall off your body. You're a hairy man.
[46:53.250 --> 46:55.230]  Hair is gonna fall off your body?
[46:56.210 --> 46:57.910]  Yeah, hair falls off the body.
[46:58.830 --> 46:59.610]  In my sleep?
[47:00.110 --> 47:00.490]  Yeah.
[47:01.370 --> 47:03.250]  There might be a few in there, but I mean...
[47:03.250 --> 47:04.850]  I'm not eating the ice cream, I'm just sleeping in it.
[47:05.490 --> 47:07.950]  I feel like it would get gross pretty quickly.
[47:09.050 --> 47:09.450]  Let's...
[47:13.050 --> 47:15.610]  So you think maybe I'd have to get a new one every night?
[47:16.130 --> 47:18.710]  Okay, wait. What flavor of ice cream are we talking here?
[47:20.650 --> 47:24.290]  Because if it's vanilla, then that's gonna be gross. You're gonna see everything.
[47:24.430 --> 47:29.670]  But if it's chocolate, and it covers up stuff, that could be okay. You can persuade me.
[47:30.170 --> 47:32.210]  What's the least sticky flavor of ice cream?
[47:34.230 --> 47:36.970]  I think they're all equally sticky.
[47:36.970 --> 47:39.350]  I don't think the flavor has much to do with the stickiness.
[47:40.150 --> 47:47.290]  But next time you are at an ice cream store, or maybe just approach an ice cream truck, please ask them.
[47:47.470 --> 47:49.010]  I'd love to know what they say.
[47:49.330 --> 47:51.790]  Alright, what if it's an ice cream bed, but there's sheets over the top?
[47:52.270 --> 47:54.010]  I mean, I assume there would be sheets on it.
[47:55.390 --> 47:57.510]  Are there sheets in the weird AI videos, Geoff?
[47:58.910 --> 48:01.890]  Yeah, there are, as a matter of fact. And I'm trying to send you one right now.
[48:02.750 --> 48:06.690]  If it was edible sheets, I'd be okay with it. If it was a candy sheet?
[48:09.210 --> 48:10.910]  If it's fabric, I don't like it.
[48:13.510 --> 48:15.050]  Is there any fabric you can eat?
[48:18.550 --> 48:20.530]  Probably not that you're supposed to.
[48:22.410 --> 48:24.950]  Say you are doing horse chores, like that's what's happening here.
[48:27.090 --> 48:28.790]  You know that horses love their wine.
[48:32.570 --> 48:33.930]  Oh, that's a cool pipe.
[48:34.710 --> 48:40.430]  There's a lot of different videos like this, varying degrees of grossness, but here's just an average one.
[48:40.590 --> 48:41.630]  I sent it to the text group.
[48:42.550 --> 48:44.130]  Thank you, ElbowDeepDaddy.
[48:44.350 --> 48:45.130]  Good to see you again.
[48:49.650 --> 48:52.890]  The guy climbing into some cheese pizza.
[48:54.650 --> 48:55.110]  That's dangerous.
[48:55.230 --> 48:57.390]  Yeah, that's minging. I hate this.
[48:58.290 --> 48:59.310]  Señora, do you need help?
[49:01.230 --> 49:03.790]  February's slime bed, I think.
[49:05.790 --> 49:08.550]  Oh, the guy's just leaking. Okay, that's disgusting.
[49:14.930 --> 49:17.710]  I think I'd want to sleep on a bed of hands. I just want to try it.
[49:18.710 --> 49:26.270]  I've been getting a lot of AI videos of a dog and a cat that have a podcast that makes fun of humans.
[49:29.310 --> 49:30.550]  Yeah, I don't know if you guys see those.
[49:30.870 --> 49:33.990]  I get a lot of AI TikToks these days.
[49:34.850 --> 49:39.510]  I started following a cat named WasUpWithGup and he's got huge weird eyes.
[49:41.110 --> 49:42.290]  Now that's content.
[49:51.310 --> 49:57.810]  Whenever I get TikToks like the AI animal podcast thing, I just think of...
[49:57.810 --> 50:03.590]  Some company sees that and says, $5 billion more in investment. This is cool.
[50:05.250 --> 50:06.130]  The future.
[50:07.110 --> 50:13.890]  I get a lot of those and a lot of alien hosts, like aliens that have late night TV shows.
[50:14.290 --> 50:18.950]  And it'll be like the alien Johnny Carson and it'll have another alien come on and they'll talk about how dumb humans are.
[50:19.930 --> 50:21.350]  I gotta say, this looks pretty delicious.
[50:22.070 --> 50:22.690]  I would eat that.
[50:22.890 --> 50:26.610]  I'd eat the side of a pig. I'd eat pig side.
[50:28.990 --> 50:30.030]  How about the little hoof?
[50:30.830 --> 50:31.730]  Tiny little hoof.
[50:35.770 --> 50:36.490]  Some ribs.
[50:37.190 --> 50:38.990]  A lot of Gup fans in the chat.
[50:39.290 --> 50:41.930]  Oh really? Are people into WasUpGup? Hell yeah, dude.
[50:43.230 --> 50:45.190]  He freaky looking. He's pretty cool, dude.
[50:50.730 --> 50:52.150]  Where's the bacon on that? Right at the back?
[50:54.370 --> 50:55.510]  Maybe off at the top?
[50:57.350 --> 50:58.530]  Oh, show me that pig foot.
[50:59.810 --> 51:01.470]  We'll hang on to that for Nick later, you know?
[51:02.130 --> 51:04.910]  Which way around? Are you holding the back end?
[51:07.810 --> 51:08.530]  Little foot for you.
[51:08.610 --> 51:10.910]  There you go, little pig foot for you, Nick.
[51:11.950 --> 51:12.150]  Enjoy.
[51:14.650 --> 51:17.590]  Do you think Nick got a bonus wherever he is right now? He doesn't know why.
[51:19.170 --> 51:20.790]  He's just like, whoa, what the fuck?
[51:22.770 --> 51:24.770]  That's a lot of hog. Yes, it is, Mellon.
[51:26.340 --> 51:29.150]  Anything like this for my Nick.
[51:29.390 --> 51:31.490]  I just want to throw this on that table.
[51:32.450 --> 51:34.570]  Stop eating the pizza!
[51:38.630 --> 51:40.710]  You stole that guy's recipe?
[51:42.240 --> 51:44.010]  Good fucking luck now, buddy.
[51:44.470 --> 51:45.170]  Caterpig!
[51:45.690 --> 51:46.510]  Cranked ya!
[51:49.470 --> 51:51.810]  Here's another one. That's Nick's recipe.
[51:52.210 --> 51:52.890]  That's mine.
[51:53.670 --> 51:57.130]  We should try to cook the meals in those recipes.
[51:58.790 --> 52:03.810]  There's a bunch of meals in the Indiana Jones game as collectibles, and I think I've screenshotted all of them.
[52:04.230 --> 52:04.530]  Oh, really?
[52:05.470 --> 52:08.910]  That could be a fun show. We could have a video game recipe show where we make stuff.
[52:10.190 --> 52:10.710]  That would be great.
[52:12.130 --> 52:13.430]  The new Epic Mealtime, guys.
[52:18.370 --> 52:19.530]  Epic Games Mealtime.
[52:20.530 --> 52:21.710]  What is that?
[52:21.710 --> 52:23.510]  Oh, that's like tomato stuff, I think.
[52:23.650 --> 52:25.190]  That's not going to help you much here.
[52:26.430 --> 52:29.610]  I think it's all like tomato puree.
[52:30.110 --> 52:31.190]  Yeah, I think there's some dried tomatoes.
[52:32.190 --> 52:37.750]  The ability of that person with the spoon to spread it in the exact same pan on each tray is unbelievable.
[52:38.290 --> 52:38.950]  They're good at it.
[52:39.570 --> 52:40.690]  These are real artisans.
[52:41.210 --> 52:45.890]  It's like he had four spoons all connected with a rod and did them all at the same time.
[52:46.890 --> 52:50.650]  Damiano Bastoni would be a hilarious name for the owner of the Boston Celtics.
[52:51.990 --> 52:53.710]  Bastoni has them.
[52:57.570 --> 53:02.430]  That's right, I stabbed him like 18 times in the chest. It was crazy.
[53:03.830 --> 53:05.910]  Thank you, Sharky Knees. I'm sorry about your knees.
[53:09.910 --> 53:11.910]  Horse chores. Horse chores.
[53:14.290 --> 53:15.570]  Horse chores.
[53:16.990 --> 53:17.950]  Another recipe.
[53:24.090 --> 53:25.290]  That's a fucked up shovel.
[53:26.670 --> 53:27.390]  It's got a bend.
[53:28.710 --> 53:34.150]  Clean out the stables. What is this game? No one wants to shovel shit 45 minutes into a game, surely.
[53:36.090 --> 53:38.130]  Or even 51 minutes into a game.
[53:38.330 --> 53:39.410]  Who made this, Ubisoft?
[53:40.530 --> 53:40.970]  2K.
[53:41.690 --> 53:44.910]  Wow, really? They made this in NBA? That's wild.
[53:46.470 --> 53:48.230]  Do you think this guy's going to be in NBA 2K?
[53:49.090 --> 53:53.090]  I think it's about to say a spikely joint in about 3 minutes.
[53:57.890 --> 53:59.370]  She's the tomato lady.
[54:04.950 --> 54:09.030]  That one time I was a minor and I stabbed a guy 15 times. It was crazy.
[54:09.310 --> 54:11.330]  That was about 12 hours ago.
[54:13.550 --> 54:17.930]  Have we seen the title screen of the game yet? Yeah, we did. We did about a half hour ago, maybe.
[54:19.690 --> 54:22.630]  It wasn't a lot of fanfare to it.
[54:23.950 --> 54:25.790]  Oh, we had to not have the music, just in case.
[54:30.220 --> 54:39.750]  Oh, that was a good bite.
[54:39.750 --> 54:41.790]  Look at that bite mark.
[54:43.750 --> 54:47.410]  I'm not saying the animation was good, I'm saying the chunk that she got out of the apple.
[54:48.170 --> 54:50.630]  The acid swap to the bitten apple was great.
[54:54.830 --> 54:56.590]  Cablove said I was hoping it was a tomato.
[54:59.110 --> 54:59.510]  Crunch.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.660]  What if we just make a video where we eat a bunch of different food but replace all the eating sounds with the wrong ones?
[55:08.260 --> 55:09.340]  That's a good idea.
[55:09.340 --> 55:15.860]  I feel like I've seen a sketch like that from Derek Comedy or Good Neighbor or something.
[55:16.060 --> 55:16.940]  It sounds so familiar.
[55:17.540 --> 55:21.740]  Maybe there was a gun sounds one where they did different gun sounds?
[55:22.680 --> 55:23.680]  That's very funny.
[55:24.320 --> 55:26.300]  Yeah, it's like really old movies that do that too.
[55:26.740 --> 55:31.760]  I think I could just take all the footage I've got of Nick eating and maybe just swap all the sounds around.
[55:39.580 --> 55:43.640]  Go back to your room and get cleaned up. Or you'll put everyone off their food.
[55:45.100 --> 55:46.400]  Do I get to put my hat on now?
[55:51.160 --> 55:55.120]  Are you going to get to drive a fucking car maybe? That would be cool.
[55:55.480 --> 55:58.780]  I think there's like racing. I think there's car racing in this game.
[56:00.540 --> 56:02.260]  Is there shooting people in the face?
[56:02.440 --> 56:05.640]  I couldn't tell you that. If there is, I don't know that we're going to see it.
[56:05.940 --> 56:08.340]  You walked a difficult path for someone so young.
[56:08.720 --> 56:14.160]  Do we have to go through a fucking hour long tutorial of how to make tires before we're allowed to drive a car?
[56:14.320 --> 56:15.100]  Yeah, probably.
[56:16.380 --> 56:17.620]  Let me put my hat on.
[56:18.340 --> 56:22.260]  Do you think if we instead streamed Battlefield 6 we would be in the game by now?
[56:23.600 --> 56:23.980]  No.
[56:25.300 --> 56:26.280]  I should download it right now.
[56:26.880 --> 56:28.800]  I don't know if it's public beta yet.
[56:29.480 --> 56:30.220]  Are you going to be invited?
[56:30.580 --> 56:31.340]  I think so, yeah.
[56:31.800 --> 56:34.600]  Well, I definitely wasn't. Never mind.
[56:35.140 --> 56:35.900]  Bath time!
[56:35.900 --> 56:38.100]  They invited Tim the Tapman, but not you?
[56:38.240 --> 56:39.300]  It's messed up.
[56:44.740 --> 56:47.780]  Which would you rather have be real, a Frankenstein or a Dracula?
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.000]  Oh...
[56:50.000 --> 56:50.440]  Frankenstein.
[56:50.900 --> 56:51.380]  Frankenstein.
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.320]  Dracula can make other Draculas.
[56:55.500 --> 56:57.760]  Yeah, Frankenstein doesn't make other Frankensteins.
[56:58.620 --> 56:59.180]  Interesting.
[57:00.980 --> 57:01.540]  Gavin?
[57:03.140 --> 57:03.700]  Yeah.
[57:05.320 --> 57:07.560]  Plus, people are so fucking stupid.
[57:08.200 --> 57:14.300]  Dracula wouldn't even have to do that old thing where he sneaks in and mesmerizes you and then bites your neck.
[57:14.560 --> 57:20.020]  He could just put out some commercials on TV and be like, come on over and get sucked. It's way better on this side.
[57:20.640 --> 57:22.120]  Vote against your own best interests.
[57:22.420 --> 57:23.920]  And people would be like, oh, where do I sign up?
[57:25.500 --> 57:26.660]  I'm actually pro-Dracula.
[57:35.620 --> 57:37.980]  Dracula promises to release the Epstein list.
[57:44.160 --> 57:48.500]  Why is Dracula saying the Epstein list is a hoax now? I could have scored last month.
[57:49.980 --> 57:51.440]  Promising to release it immediately.
[57:51.640 --> 57:55.700]  I only voted for him because he said he was going to drain the Black Lagoon and now I just...
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.380]  It's a celebration.
[58:01.600 --> 58:03.500]  Now there's swamp creatures everywhere.
[58:04.500 --> 58:07.140]  Release the Frankenstein files.
[58:11.260 --> 58:13.920]  Dude, Mafia show is fucking good.
[58:23.080 --> 58:24.840]  And action.
[58:26.660 --> 58:29.180]  Mark the Frog got some shit nobody ever heard of.
[58:29.500 --> 58:33.020]  Dude, Mark the Frog is so into Warhammer, it's awesome.
[58:33.140 --> 58:33.660]  Yeah, he is.
[58:34.960 --> 58:37.880]  Mark the Frog got a mention in our sandwich squashing video.
[58:38.140 --> 58:40.520]  We're all about Mark the Frog. Me and Geoff are Mark the Frogheads.
[58:40.980 --> 58:44.840]  He might be the most mentioned person in regulation since...
[58:45.960 --> 58:46.520]  Fine, it's Bummer.
[58:47.900 --> 58:49.860]  Bummer and probably Greg from Finance.
[58:50.040 --> 58:50.600]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[58:51.200 --> 58:53.180]  Ah, finally, the guest of honor.
[58:54.840 --> 58:55.740]  There she is.
[58:56.820 --> 58:58.800]  The girl we saw earlier, I assume.
[59:02.280 --> 59:02.720]  Who is she?
[59:04.320 --> 59:06.180]  Oh my god, it's his daughter.
[59:07.300 --> 59:08.860]  No one could have seen that coming, honestly.
[59:09.400 --> 59:11.680]  Please, my friends, my family.
[59:12.480 --> 59:16.500]  Be upstanding in the celebration of my beautiful daughter, Isabella.
[59:16.900 --> 59:17.800]  On her name day.
[59:18.660 --> 59:19.500]  Name day?
[59:19.820 --> 59:21.540]  Yeah, they named her Isabella today.
[59:21.740 --> 59:22.780]  Before she has been a girl.
[59:24.480 --> 59:28.880]  Oh, C-Rob said if you played Mafia 3, you know this meeting is bullshit.
[59:29.020 --> 59:30.580]  And then bullshit was in capital letters.
[59:30.820 --> 59:32.780]  Andrew, are you familiar with that?
[59:33.060 --> 59:34.240]  I haven't played Mafia 3.
[59:35.220 --> 59:36.680]  You know what's wrong with this meeting then.
[59:36.680 --> 59:38.440]  That game opens with a heist gone wrong.
[59:38.700 --> 59:39.140]  Oh, that's cool.
[59:42.370 --> 59:43.230]  I'm gonna need an explanation.
[59:44.110 --> 59:45.690]  Clutch my pearls pod is in here.
[59:46.250 --> 59:46.490]  What?
[59:46.910 --> 59:49.010]  And Mark the Frog? What the fuck?
[59:49.610 --> 59:50.470]  Clutch my frogs.
[59:55.600 --> 59:56.900]  Clutch my frogs.
[59:57.500 --> 59:58.200]  Hello, darling.
[59:58.760 --> 59:59.900]  New achievement. Cool.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.820]  Edzo found a new home.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.120]  Mark the pearl.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.800]  I think this game probably really picks up and there's a lot to it or whatever.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.960]  If you had to ask me to judge it after an hour, I think I hate this game.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.720]  Yeah, I bought it earlier today and I...
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.240]  Oh, you fool.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.680]  You fool.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.420]  I bought it as a backup just in case there were any kind of tech issues with Andrew or whatever.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.640]  Somebody should be able to go, you know.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.380]  Oh, we could have just played something else.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.220]  Eh, no.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:28.760]  Hey.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.860]  I liked Mafia 1.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.780]  Was that the face, like, see if they're lying one?
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.100]  No, that was L.A. Noire.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.180]  I don't think I've played either of those franchises.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.640]  Well, L.A. Noire is only just one game, right?
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.940]  Great game, though.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.360]  It is. Yeah, it's fun.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:50.580]  I...
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.440]  I'd like to see you play L.A. Noire and try to deduce what...
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.680]  Is it on PC?
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:56.880]  Yeah.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:57.780]  Probably?
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.880]  It's on every platform at this point.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.920]  A lot of spitting in this game.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.400]  It is a lot of spitting in this.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.760]  Spitting in the game.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.660]  Italy spits a lot, I assume.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:13.820]  Yeah.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.820]  This game is for people who love watching the History Channel.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.020]  Have you guys started watching the new episodes of King of the Hill yet?
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.020]  No. No, just on TikTok.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.440]  It's pretty good.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.440]  Yeah, you know, Gus had some pretty strong reviews about it, and it wasn't terrible, so...
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.620]  A giant mutated ceiling hippo.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.260]  You can name yourself anything on this side.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.020]  Thank you for the five subs. Appreciate it.
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.880]  In front of the cream wine. Thanks for those gifted subs. Appreciate you.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:52.360]  Hell yeah.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.920]  I think things are gonna pop off here.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.320]  I think this is an explosion.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.000]  I think so. I think someone tries to rob this carriage.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.020]  The Mosno's five gifted.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.160]  Yeah, it could be.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:10.500]  You might be on your way to, like, the Intuit Dome or whatever, though, to play the Clippers.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.140]  If this is truly a TK game.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.520]  Guys, we are one minute away from the best...
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.140]  You can post up against James Harden. That'd be pretty cool, right?
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.160]  Or maybe Chris Paul now.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.220]  Do you think two horses have ever crashed into each other so hard they exploded?
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.520]  Oh, I bet it's been pretty close.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.960]  I bet it's happened where it looks like they're about to explode.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.600]  Do you think...
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.920]  Stop putting your horse in the other horse.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.620]  Stop being there.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:47.620]  Do you think a horse has ever hit another horse so hard that he just went right through it?
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.580]  Like split the horse?
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.160]  Like split a horse in half.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:51.920]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.200]  Like a horse T-boned another horse at full speed.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.020]  Like a horse hit by a train?
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:57.900]  Yeah.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.960]  But the train is also a horse.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.420]  Boom, horse shot.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.100]  I like it.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.460]  Boys, it's 5-0-1.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.420]  It's time of the week.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.960]  This is mafia.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.940]  Something's about to happen, Andrew said.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:18.940]  And we can feel it.
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:24.160]  Yeah, we're gonna hang tight and roll with this until something happens.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.440]  We need anything to happen in this game.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.780]  Would it be incentive if I bought a dead horse and hit it with a train?
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.540]  Did you kill the horse?
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.080]  No, I just already did.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.520]  Did it die of natural causes?
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.200]  I don't know what you're proving.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.780]  I think it's fine.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:41.960]  Why?
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.720]  Let's see what it looks like.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.340]  You know what, Andrew's saying what I'm saying.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.040]  Go for it.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.060]  To show the dangers of trains.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.300]  No, I guess I would also have to rent the train.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.140]  The train doesn't have to know anything about it.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.880]  That's the one thing you don't have to rent.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.140]  Yeah.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:09.920]  Can you imagine being a train conductor, just going about your business?
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.280]  And the next thing you know, there's just horse goo all over the front of your train out of nowhere.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:19.220]  And then you stop the train and you look at it, and you go, is that the fucking slow-mo guys?
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.500]  And then you guys pick up the train.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.680]  By running away from a dead, propped up horse.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.440]  I think I'm Han's friend.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.180]  Probably told this story a few times in the old days.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.980]  But when I was in the army, we were in Kuwait one time.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.420]  We were booking it through the desert in a Bradley fighting vehicle.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:38.580]  And we went over a hill, caught a little bit of lip of air, came down.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.540]  There was a Bedouin with a bunch of goats.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.660]  And we ran right through, like, two or three goats.
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:48.800]  And it was just... it was just goat debris all over the Bradley.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.320]  And then they had to get out and, like, talk to them and apologize.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.860]  And I assume... I don't know what happened after that. We just left.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.780]  But I assume the military had to buy that dude some goats or something.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.720]  It was some...
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.640]  Just a goat invoice.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:01.400]  Yeah.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.040]  Okay. You're doing horse racing.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.500]  He's mixing up the liquid.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.660]  When he opens it, it's gonna blow up in his face. It's gonna be hilarious.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:17.680]  I also was walking through the desert in Kuwait one time and found a boot with a foot in it.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.380]  Which would have been from the Gulf War.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:27.400]  An episode that's coming out, I think, next week, where Geoff reveals concussion numbers.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.000]  It was very stunning to the entire show.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:35.500]  I'm glad that I still have... I still have a few ways to surprise you guys.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.300]  I thought you'd heard everything there was to hear.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.200]  I guess I never mentioned all the concussions to you guys.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.720]  It was one guy talking about it and four guys fucking stunned.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.280]  Did you get a concussion when you puffed gasoline and passed out?
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.640]  Or was that just like a gentle fall?
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.820]  No, that was a gentle fall. I didn't hit my head or anything on that.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.860]  I think I fell gently.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.400]  I remember thinking, this is...
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.900]  They put me in that warehouse with like a hundred lawnmowers.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.420]  That wasn't that many, maybe 40 lawnmowers, 30 lawnmowers and like different lawn devices.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.600]  And they said, drain the gas out of all of them for the winter.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.340]  And then we'll come back in like six hours and check on you.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.020]  And I thought, this is going to be the best day of my life.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.800]  And then the next thing I remember, I'm just in the back of a pickup truck.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.460]  And people are like fanning me as we're driving.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:27.500]  Incredible.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.560]  Well, Andrew, want to wrap this thing up or what do you think?
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.180]  Nobody robbed the truck.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.640]  Keep it going, man.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.340]  I'm going to get to the game.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.340]  Yeah, let's keep it going.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.440]  It's been an hour. We haven't quite got to the game yet.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.240]  I'm sure we will in a minute.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.480]  We have my knife and this lady, okay.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.100]  Kind of reminds me of the beginning of Hitman 2.
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:51.540]  Yes.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.480]  Was that also this fun?
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.860]  No, because you probably already killed like eight people by this point.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:03.340]  Well, we did have a run where you choked four guys to death in a row.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.400]  That's true.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.100]  Where should we go with this?
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.000]  We got 200. What are we picking? The Viperi? The Dragoony?
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.580]  Or the Colossus?
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.720]  I kind of like the...
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.240]  Guy like me is a Colossus guy, but that's just me.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.620]  I'm right there with Eric. A Colossus looks like... If I'm stabbing somebody, I want it to be in that.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.180]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.120]  I'll take this one.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.440]  Is this going on YouTube or is there a plan B?
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.320]  Yeah, I think, unfortunately, this will be what we put up.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.880]  Knowing that blade could save your life.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.480]  Well, this was kind of a backup for another idea that we...
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.000]  That's true.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.600]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.720]  Not Plan G, Team G.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.860]  Plan G for Team G.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.120]  G-Team.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.160]  You better have another scripted knife fight.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.840]  Do all the damage in the game and then you get messed up in the cutscene.
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:20.760]  You know, I played a little bit of Tony Hawk 3 and 4 over the weekend.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.140]  Yeah.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.600]  Because of the VOD y'all did.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:24.300]  Mm-hmm.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.320]  And I didn't really enjoy it that much.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:27.740]  Me neither.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.540]  Yeah, I liked...
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:39.420]  I liked it nearly as much as 1 and 2.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:43.840]  Like, collect skate and the mystery VHS tape and all that stuff just...
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.480]  It just felt, like, unnecessary.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.500]  I just wanted to skateboard on the levels.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:48.520]  Ow.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.600]  Why are you doing this again?
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.980]  We've already done this.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.420]  And this guy's, like, your friend or something.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.840]  Also, where's your knife?
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.420]  This is, like, practice.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:00.980]  Yeah, practice.
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.460]  We should do this.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.140]  Yeah.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.540]  We is not me.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.360]  Geoff just watched all the final destinations.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.460]  You're not going to convince him to go into a...
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.660]  I don't even know what to call it.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:23.580]  Holstered knife?
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.920]  What is a knife called in this game?
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:26.880]  Bladeless?
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.200]  Bladeless knife.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.460]  Oh, this game has a parry.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:30.100]  Nice.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:30.680]  A hilt off?
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.500]  Yeah, it's just a hilt.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.620]  Parry me again.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:37.700]  Parry me again.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.500]  Anybody getting Assassin's Creed vibes from this game at all?
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.120]  Shout out to Cream on the front, or whatever that guy's name was.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.240]  Yay! Thanks, Front Cream.
[01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:04.390]  What's it say on the recent...
[01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:08.770]  Front Cream rises to the front of the line.
[01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.870]  You get free cream at the front.
[01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.610]  That's my username of the day, I think. Front of the Cream line.
[01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.130]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:20.610]  Cream on the front.
[01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.830]  Mark the Frog is gifting a sub.
[01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.750]  What the fuck?
[01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.410]  Thank you so much, Mark the Frog.
[01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:32.810]  Gaffman98 gets a sub from Mark the Frog.
[01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.550]  That was very kind of you, Mark.
[01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:40.470]  Is this game for people who have never played a video game?
[01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.930]  Yes.
[01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:45.430]  This is the kind of game you give somebody if they're like,
[01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:48.430]  I'm thinking about getting into video games, but you don't want them to get into video games,
[01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:49.590]  because then they'll be insufferable.
[01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:51.850]  They're like, oh, check out Mafia, everybody loves that.
[01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:53.290]  And the guy's like, I don't know, man, I just...
[01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:56.230]  I don't mind when a game is this story front-loaded.
[01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:00.390]  I mean, for extreme, it would be nice if there was more action happening, but...
[01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:03.990]  As far as just, like, a game as a game, I have no issues.
[01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:06.850]  I just feel like I've done this in games about eight times.
[01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:10.870]  I've done this whole thing so much.
[01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:16.990]  Yeah, this feels like the equivalent of being told Spider-Man's origin story.
[01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:26.070]  He bit his finger.
[01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:32.130]  I've played this game six times.
[01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:34.790]  I've done this intro so much.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:49.880]  I think this game is preparing you to have a lot of one-on-one knife fights.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.500]  I mean, sounds awesome.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.720]  I'm not mad at that.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:56.780]  Pick up your knife.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.380]  What's on the ground over there?
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.760]  You probably don't need it.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.080]  It's probably back in your inventory immediately.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.120]  He must have it. I think he picked it up and he handed it to you. I think you're fine.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.340]  The knife? Yeah, you get it back.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:08.920]  Hi, horse.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:09.600]  Oh!
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.040]  Can you stab it?
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.180]  Nah.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.680]  Can you put the horse's head up as well?
[01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:23.790]  We'll have to be quick if we want to make it to the game.
[01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:24.770]  A moat spur the horse?
[01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:27.870]  Clayton, not Satan.
[01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:31.310]  Eleven months! Wow, thank you so much.
[01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:34.410]  Oh, that's a good sound.
[01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:35.610]  That's a great sound.
[01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:36.670]  That is good.
[01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:37.890]  I don't know about that.
[01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:42.150]  I could just go back and forth over that bridge for a while.
[01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:49.010]  Horses do sound good.
[01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:50.830]  They sound great.
[01:12:57.730 --> 01:13:02.710]  I think horse sounds are underrated.
[01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:05.230]  You think so?
[01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:09.250]  I mean, that's not what people talk about when they talk about horses.
[01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.890]  What do they talk about?
[01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:15.550]  They talk about how majestic they are, how fast they are, how powerful they are, beautiful,
[01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:18.450]  they've got long manes, or they can jump real good.
[01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.230]  But they don't ever be like, man, listen to it though, it sounds fucking awesome.
[01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:24.630]  I feel the same way about basketball.
[01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:27.910]  Great sounding sport.
[01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:34.510]  My mother-in-law cannot watch basketball because of that noise.
[01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.930]  Really?
[01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:36.090]  Yeah.
[01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:40.550]  A nice crack of a baseball bat is good too.
[01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:43.330]  I think baseball is the best sounding sport.
[01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:49.230]  I know the dogs smell pretty good, it's a good smelling sport.
[01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:51.310]  Best sounding sport.
[01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:54.370]  I think in arena, hockey sounds phenomenal.
[01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.130]  Hockey is pretty good.
[01:13:56.370 --> 01:14:02.370]  There's like a floor level of noise at hockey that is pretty interesting.
[01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:05.890]  There's a noise floor.
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:10.490]  There's a crispness to the air too because it's kind of cold.
[01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:13.550]  Everything sounds a little sharper.
[01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:18.110]  It feels like you're entering a space for an activity.
[01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:20.190]  In a unique way compared to other sports.
[01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:25.530]  Going to a football game, it's no different than the weather outside generally.
[01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:29.750]  It can be a really hot day and then you go into an ice rink and it just feels different.
[01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:35.350]  I don't want to take any flak for saying this, but the only good thing about live football is the pre-gaming.
[01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:37.770]  And tailgating.
[01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:40.950]  Watching football in stands is just not that much fun.
[01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:42.470]  It's like the worst live sport.
[01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:46.250]  I think the worst live sport is racing.
[01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:50.830]  I don't even count that as a sport to go watch.
[01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:52.770]  I'm with you though.
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:54.110]  I don't know.
[01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:56.290]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:59.110]  I think we're just loud enough.
[01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:08.330]  This old guy looks like if you had King Charles and also a Koopa that you gave sick.
[01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:18.930]  NASCAR is different. I've been 20 times. It's amazing.
[01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:21.530]  NASCAR is more compact though, isn't it? It's just a loop.
[01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:24.050]  I've been to F1 twice and I liked it.
[01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:28.010]  I enjoyed the hell out of it both times, but I also am not clamoring to go back.
[01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:36.250]  I've been to F1 and NASCAR. I don't think either is a terribly exciting sport to go see.
[01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:43.950]  Once we do this race, we can wrap it up.
[01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.430]  Are we car racing? Is that what's happening?
[01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.590]  Or horse racing?
[01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:54.830]  Either way, I don't really care. I just want to race.
[01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:59.450]  It would be funny if he gave you a car to race after never touching a car.
[01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:04.150]  It takes you the whole horse tutorial to show you how to get in this car.
[01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:12.090]  We're going to give you 45 minutes of knife fighting tutorials, but you just have to win this car race right now.
[01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:14.810]  Do you have your learner's permit?
[01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:18.990]  Do you have a license for this?
[01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:23.990]  Oh, it's the day of the...
[01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.650]  Oh, we're horse racing.
[01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.810]  I wonder if you'll be able to stab while you race.
[01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:30.990]  That'd be wicked.
[01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.610]  Maybe you can spur other horses.
[01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:36.730]  Backwards spurring so they slow down.
[01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:43.390]  I'll also say dirt track round car racing is fucking awesome live because we've been going to that Cottonball Speedway.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:53.600]  We're going to like a big no-ring deathmatch pro wrestling show tonight.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:54.960]  Oh, awesome.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.380]  No-ring is like so crazy. It's just people fighting in a bar. It's awesome.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:11.320]  You don't see the whole thing, but you see it when it gets close to you. It's at like Hotel Vegas.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.800]  Oh, you're going to run out of spurs, buddy.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.900]  I'm letting it charge.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.040]  I'm going to get a blue shell and change this whole race.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.340]  It's like the exact Breath of the Wild spur system.
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.260]  I can't figure it out, you know.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.360]  Do you feel like you have an advantage because of that, Andrew?
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.420]  For sure, yeah.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.960]  As someone who played one hour of Breath of the Wild, yeah.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:49.420]  I like that you played every single second of Mind's Eye, but played an hour of Breath of the Wild.
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.340]  Some games have it, some games don't.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.800]  He likes what he likes. What do you want?
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:08.740]  I'll be honest. I liked Tears of the Kingdom like eight times more than Breath of the Wild.
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:13.440]  Oh, man. I was the other way. I love Breath of the Wild, but Tears of the Kingdom, I'm only just now getting into.
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:16.880]  I like it so much more.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.600]  So this whole city just goes like, all right, horse time.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:31.820]  Getting bullied.
[01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:37.150]  Dude, you're supposed to win this race.
[01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:38.510]  I'm walking in.
[01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:42.650]  Okay, is there any crashing you can do? Can you smash a horse off the track?
[01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.630]  So far, no.
[01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:46.750]  Okay, that was close.
[01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:50.830]  I was like, they didn't teach me how to do that. I hope I don't have to hit anything.
[01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:53.270]  All right, spurs time, baby.
[01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:56.070]  Cut you off, cut you off, cut you off, cut you off.
[01:18:56.290 --> 01:18:57.310]  Nice, good cut off.
[01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:59.070]  Look at that.
[01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:01.610]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.070]  Let's go, you spurs.
[01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:04.290]  Right, Gavin?
[01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:08.010]  Come on, you spurs.
[01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:10.290]  Go, spurs, go.
[01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:12.050]  Wimby time, baby.
[01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:20.010]  Come on, you better fucking blow by this fucking horse, bro.
[01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:21.330]  I'm trying.
[01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:23.090]  You got it.
[01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:24.590]  Here we go, he's slowing down.
[01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:30.830]  I bet this game makes you go and this race lasts until you get first place.
[01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:33.450]  Oh no, you've been done.
[01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:33.990]  Uh-oh.
[01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:35.830]  Nope, nope, nope, nope, I got the inside.
[01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.890]  Ooh, nice.
[01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.190]  Knock him off the fucking...
[01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:42.350]  You're not even close to that horse.
[01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:44.730]  He's so much faster than you.
[01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.290]  Yeah, he's better actually.
[01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:48.630]  Spurs.
[01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:50.390]  Spurs.
[01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.510]  Spurs.
[01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:57.850]  You caught him there, boys.
[01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:59.450]  You did it.
[01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:00.690]  Oh, come on.
[01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:01.230]  Spurs.
[01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.910]  Spurs!
[01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:03.990]  Are they shooting at you?
[01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:05.010]  Spurs!
[01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:08.450]  They're firing confetti at you or something.
[01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:09.290]  Yeah!
[01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:11.430]  It's right there.
[01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:12.210]  Oh, it's fine.
[01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:13.310]  It's still fine.
[01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:15.370]  Go, go, go, go, go, Wimby!
[01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:16.270]  Wimby!
[01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.770]  And there you have it, Horse Racing Simulator 2K25.
[01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:24.110]  Comes to a close, we've done it.
[01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:27.610]  Like a true mafia game, we won the horse race.
[01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:31.670]  It's, uh...
[01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:36.710]  I think a brave move to have a mafia game where you don't kill anybody for the first 80 minutes.
[01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:39.530]  But you do race a horse.
[01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:45.690]  Do another hour.
[01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:49.830]  Can you imagine if you didn't win that race and had to do it again?
[01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:50.170]  No.
[01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:56.490]  You wanna do another hour, Andrew?
[01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.270]  Eric's got rasslin'.
[01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:04.350]  I got time. We can keep, uh...
[01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:06.470]  I can go. I actually...
[01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:07.570]  What did I say that?
[01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:08.530]  I don't know!
[01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:11.030]  You fucking dug your own gravy, dummy.
[01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:13.790]  I got my mom in town and I'm cooking dinner for her today.
[01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:17.590]  Well, you better tell her to order in because we're doing mafia!
[01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.770]  Mafia!
[01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:26.330]  I just feel bad shitting on a game for an hour straight when it might get good.
[01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:27.170]  It might get good.
[01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:28.190]  It really might.
[01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:31.830]  I will say, as the person playing, I'm having fun.
[01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:37.770]  I'm gonna play all of this what I watched Andrew do when I play mafia later tonight, probably.
[01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:39.890]  After you've cooked?
[01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:42.030]  Yeah. After everybody goes to bed.
[01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:43.590]  But while he's eating dinner.
[01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:45.470]  I'll sit in my room by myself.
[01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:46.430]  Koopa Charles.
[01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:48.430]  Deliver this.
[01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:50.430]  Bond's compliments.
[01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:56.890]  What an awkward cheat tab.
[01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:00.890]  Is there any cheats?
[01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.450]  What do you mean?
[01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:04.670]  Hey, you got big head mode or what?
[01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:05.750]  Yeah.
[01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:09.050]  Yeah, can we turn all the enemies into tofu?
[01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:20.610]  I wonder if there is any game that turns everyone into milfs.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.380]  What are you doing down here?
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.860]  Tapping you on the shoulder, idiot.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.100]  You just won the shit out of that race and nobody cares.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:50.880]  Oh, you get to do a delivery mission.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.200]  Cool.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.380]  Contemplate if I want to join the Jedi's or become a Sith.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.760]  Your father showed me a kindness.
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:03.540]  I can do that song.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:12.260]  Pizza rolls!
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.360]  I want pizza rolls!
[01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:25.850]  Much like Qui-Gon Jinn, buy one get one half off.
[01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:27.110]  Where would you go without me?
[01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:29.570]  I guess that was Dark Maul.
[01:23:29.690 --> 01:23:29.930]  Yeah.
[01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:32.370]  Stop it.
[01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:36.590]  None of these characters know who Mr. Bean is.
[01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:43.970]  They'll all die before Mr. Bean happens.
[01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:46.630]  That's what I think about whenever I'm reading the Bible.
[01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:51.370]  They'll never know what that means.
[01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.710]  Oh boy.
[01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.910]  They don't know about Doctor Who as well. That's not true. Doctor Who went back in time.
[01:24:02.130 --> 01:24:03.190]  That's probably the good Doctor.
[01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:13.390]  I would love for a game to reveal it's a Doctor Who game with seven hours into it.
[01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:14.970]  Crazy.
[01:24:16.290 --> 01:24:17.370]  That'd be really cool.
[01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:26.890]  Come on. Pick a bottle. Any bottle.
[01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:28.710]  Yeah, stand there and look at me like a dipshit.
[01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:29.870]  Yeah, that's what I meant. Thanks, man.
[01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:32.630]  And the Don, of course.
[01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:35.930]  Don? Bene. On to the next one.
[01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:39.530]  Who was he?
[01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:40.930]  I have no idea.
[01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:45.850]  That noise was so real and not a joke.
[01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:49.230]  When you watch a movie, Gavin, you go, oh, more talking.
[01:24:50.190 --> 01:24:54.710]  If I was 80 minutes into a movie and this is what we've done, I'd be livid.
[01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.870]  Really?
[01:24:56.190 --> 01:24:56.390]  Yes.
[01:24:56.890 --> 01:25:00.590]  Especially if it was advertised as Fast and the Furious.
[01:25:02.150 --> 01:25:03.350]  Where's your next stop?
[01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:06.870]  It says Via Nino Agave.
[01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:09.050]  But that's on the other side of town.
[01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:09.950]  Oh, great.
[01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:12.210]  Oh, no. The other side of town.
[01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:13.510]  Can't wait for me to leave.
[01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:20.590]  That's just Dino. Don't take it personally. But are you going to leave? I mean...
[01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:22.370]  I don't plan to.
[01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:24.990]  But he says this game is all Charlie work.
[01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:30.170]  Thank you, front of the green line. Five gifted. Hell yeah.
[01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:35.510]  Dude, I wish Andrew could bash rats with a baseball bat. At least that would...
[01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.970]  I could chase them.
[01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.750]  Yeah.
[01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:42.890]  I don't have a sprint button, unfortunately, in this scenario. I can't shake up their wine though.
[01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:46.130]  It sounds like you're shaking the shit out of it.
[01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:51.370]  I wonder if we should make a chart of time to kill from pressing start on a video game.
[01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:52.870]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:53.970]  For each game.
[01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:54.650]  What's that?
[01:25:54.650 --> 01:26:02.290]  That's like how our wives podcast, the Clutch by Pearls, has the, like, what page the first coming is on.
[01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:02.510]  Yeah.
[01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:05.250]  Like, what minute the first killing is.
[01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:17.190]  It's cool that they let him actually carry wine. After that last night fight, I was worried they would make him walk around with an empty box and deliver... practice deliver wine.
[01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:20.950]  Yeah.
[01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:27.510]  Should we make a Slack channel called Time to Kill? And just track every game we play, how long it takes for the first kill?
[01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.890]  Yeah, let's do that.
[01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:28.170]  Yeah.
[01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.970]  Pretty good.
[01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:33.810]  And then we can put it in a chart at the end of the year.
[01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:34.230]  Yeah.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.640]  I mean, the kill has to be around the corner in this one.
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:50.260]  Somebody asked how the peace and employment sales are. That's a great question, Wargasm. I haven't looked in four months.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:51.760]  Is that right?
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.120]  I have no fucking clue.
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.060]  I don't even think Czech anymore.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.640]  Oh, in Mafia 2, you have to carry crates around at a warehouse?
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:03.780]  Wow.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.100]  It's an homage to the best mission of Mafia 2.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:13.380]  All of the intros to the Mafia games, except this one, have been filled with action.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:20.360]  Mafia 1 opens up with, like, you're getting away from, like, your taxi driver driving mobsters, trying to evade.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:24.060]  Mafia 2 opens with you're fighting in a war.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.320]  And Mafia 3 is a heist going on.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.440]  That was a knife we could have bought.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:33.540]  Okay, so I'm confused. Tell him to put the blade away so you guys can hit each other with the hilt.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:35.940]  Yeah.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.620]  Am I going to kill somebody now?
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:39.920]  Oh, Andrew, what a way to go out. This'll be it.
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.360]  This is it. This is the game.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:42.560]  Lay on, bro.
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:43.320]  Don't forget to parry!
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:44.320]  You forgot to parry.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:45.920]  You forgot to parry.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.580]  You forgot to parry.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.800]  You're going to need to parry.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040]  I'm here for you.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:50.820]  He did it.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:51.500]  There you go.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.780]  I was telling you the controls in the top left. You didn't need that practice.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:56.900]  You forgot to parry.
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.540]  Oh, you got some blood on your back.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:58.840]  You dodged.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.700]  I think I'm more of a dodge guy.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.980]  I think the parry is the thing that's working for you, man.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.680]  Oh, nice!
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:11.800]  Stab him in the butthole.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:12.640]  Stab him right in the butthole.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.420]  Give him a second butthole.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.380]  Make his poop confused.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.160]  I don't know what that means.
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.340]  We're getting a real kill.
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:28.580]  Why is it echoing?
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:32.940]  Oh my god.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.040]  Parry!
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.360]  I don't think I can parry the red one.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.320]  Dodge first, slow him down.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:52.340]  Oh, you got this, dude.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:53.620]  You don't stand a chance.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:01.240]  Got him! Got him!
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:01.940]  Murder.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.340]  I don't think you're going to kill him.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:03.780]  Maybe?
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:04.580]  No.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:06.700]  Maybe by accident?
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.020]  These people shrug off stab wounds like...
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:10.960]  ...tub toes.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.500]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.060]  You don't even get to kill him.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.620]  This is the third knife fight.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:30.640]  It depends on what month you were born.
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.380]  Ah, pizza knife again.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.840]  He's confused with the pizza knife.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.680]  Is that a fight with a marshmallow knife?
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.380]  You're about to get a stern cutscene talking to you.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:48.720]  The pacifist run continues.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.400]  Melania is with that guy who was stabbing.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:31.300]  Yeah, everything except that part.
[01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:41.910]  And that's Mafia the Old Country.
[01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:47.070]  I'm going to keep playing independently of this.
[01:30:47.210 --> 01:30:48.750]  And I will update the time to kill.
[01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.910]  How long it takes.
[01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:52.710]  Would love to hear it.
[01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:54.230]  Thank you guys so much for watching.

[01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.270]  And that's Andrew's achievement.
[01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:03.230]  Incredible.
[01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:05.530]  We did it.
[01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:06.410]  Thank you guys so much.
[01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:07.670]  And we will see you next time.
[01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.970]  There's another knife.
[01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:09.990]  Fourth knife fight.
[01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:10.530]  Wow.
[01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:11.190]  Bye.
[01:31:12.490 --> 01:31:12.950]  Bye.
[01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.190]  Thanks.
[01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.470]  Sorry.
[01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:13.750]  Bye.
[01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:14.590]  Bye.
[01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:15.830]  Sorry.
