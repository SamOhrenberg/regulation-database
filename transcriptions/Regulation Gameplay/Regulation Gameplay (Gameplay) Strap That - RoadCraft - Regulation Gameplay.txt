[00:00.000 --> 00:03.260]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay.
[00:03.520 --> 00:06.820]  This is Roadcraft.
[00:07.080 --> 00:09.360]  New trucks. Detach winch.
[00:09.820 --> 00:11.260]  It is, in fact, new trucks.
[00:11.360 --> 00:13.380]  I've been playing around with a little bit on my own.
[00:13.480 --> 00:14.660]  I'm a little frustrated by it.
[00:14.980 --> 00:15.780]  Andrew says it.
[00:16.080 --> 00:19.140]  It's just he just needs to do some massaging.
[00:19.600 --> 00:20.880]  We can massage it in.
[00:20.980 --> 00:25.180]  It's I hit the same wall you did, and it's because we are so familiar
[00:25.180 --> 00:28.780]  with SnowRunner and they simplified things in this game.
[00:28.780 --> 00:30.860]  Like, how do I select my rear?
[00:31.060 --> 00:32.540]  I got two winch points on my car.
[00:32.920 --> 00:33.620]  The front and the back.
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.340]  How do I select the back?
[00:36.280 --> 00:38.000]  Have the camera face backwards.
[00:38.840 --> 00:41.780]  You don't need to manually select like in SnowRunner.
[00:41.800 --> 00:43.180]  It's your camera angle.
[00:43.580 --> 00:47.220]  So you just look from the back and then you immediately made that work.
[00:47.400 --> 00:48.140]  There you go. Yeah.
[00:48.140 --> 00:50.600]  As I said, I was doing the same thing you were.
[00:50.680 --> 00:52.760]  I was like, how do I select which point?
[00:53.020 --> 00:57.240]  But it's just as simple as look in that direction and it will pull from that way.
[00:58.080 --> 01:00.720]  Well, man, this steer is so weird.
[01:01.420 --> 01:05.260]  Yeah, I definitely was thrown off by it's like it understeers
[01:05.260 --> 01:07.300]  and oversteers at the same time. Yeah, it's like
[01:08.460 --> 01:10.940]  it does both because it goes from one extreme to the other.
[01:11.140 --> 01:12.040]  Yeah. What's up with that?
[01:12.260 --> 01:15.660]  Yeah, there's no worry, Nick, because there's no fuel.
[01:16.360 --> 01:16.980]  Yeah, I know.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.180]  You know, your vehicles don't take damage either.
[01:19.200 --> 01:20.520]  I don't think right now.
[01:20.620 --> 01:21.420]  No damage as well.
[01:22.960 --> 01:25.980]  A lot of snow crafters are unhappy with that, but I heard they're
[01:26.640 --> 01:30.240]  you know, I'm in the snow craft, read it, subreddit, you know, I'm in the forums
[01:31.060 --> 01:32.680]  and they say that apparently.
[01:33.020 --> 01:34.860]  Thanks. God, it's so.
[01:35.620 --> 01:36.800]  Apparently that that's on the way.
[01:36.880 --> 01:38.680]  There's going to be like a hard mode that has fuel and stuff.
[01:38.920 --> 01:42.660]  Yeah. The steering is just so
[01:43.340 --> 01:45.760]  like this little shove thing we got going, Geoff.
[01:45.860 --> 01:47.620]  Let's get it in. Yeah.
[01:47.960 --> 01:49.600]  It's like a rugby scrum almost.
[01:51.240 --> 01:52.920]  Push. It kind of feels like push.
[01:53.720 --> 01:55.960]  Well, this is definitely not how you're supposed to do it in SnowRunner.
[01:55.960 --> 01:58.060]  But I get the impression that's just fine in this game.
[01:58.140 --> 01:59.500]  OK. Hell yeah.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.860]  Let's head to the vehicles tab.
[02:01.960 --> 02:02.620]  I got an achievement.
[02:03.340 --> 02:04.940]  Nice, Nick. Yay.
[02:06.020 --> 02:06.900]  Hell yeah.
[02:07.720 --> 02:10.620]  Select the crane truck and let's see what you can use it for.
[02:11.280 --> 02:12.420]  All right. I'm in the.
[02:13.540 --> 02:14.760]  Wait, did I do that right?
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.360]  I think I selected the rusty dozer.
[02:16.540 --> 02:17.500]  Is that what I'm supposed to be in?
[02:18.180 --> 02:19.300]  I should tell you.
[02:20.220 --> 02:22.000]  You said the rusty crane truck.
[02:24.180 --> 02:26.220]  Rusty mobile crane is what I want to be in.
[02:26.360 --> 02:27.920]  Yeah, there we go.
[02:27.980 --> 02:29.280]  Geoff, did you know the game
[02:31.540 --> 02:33.780]  has censored the off of your name?
[02:34.480 --> 02:35.280]  The OFF.
[02:36.500 --> 02:37.720]  Yeah, you're just DGG.
[02:38.760 --> 02:42.180]  You're DGE, as my closest friends call me.
[02:42.700 --> 02:44.600]  Use the crane to move them to the loading zone.
[02:44.700 --> 02:45.700]  What the fuck am I doing?
[02:45.920 --> 02:46.740]  Hold left bumper.
[02:47.960 --> 02:50.160]  So this is where I really got into the game, Geoff.
[02:50.160 --> 02:53.440]  If you want to go back to your garage,
[02:53.540 --> 02:54.960]  that's where you're going to want to be.
[02:55.280 --> 02:57.120]  Oh, I don't want to be doing this with the crane.
[02:59.280 --> 03:01.840]  Uh, move concrete slabs to the loading area.
[03:02.580 --> 03:04.240]  Yes, you could be doing it with a crane.
[03:04.360 --> 03:05.500]  I did it with a car.
[03:06.160 --> 03:06.840]  Oh, yeah, you're there.
[03:07.560 --> 03:08.740]  Yeah, yeah, you're doing it.
[03:09.620 --> 03:10.440]  Can I use this?
[03:11.320 --> 03:12.880]  Oh, deploy. There we go.
[03:15.160 --> 03:16.760]  So do I need this thing?
[03:18.760 --> 03:19.720]  What thing? Sorry.
[03:19.720 --> 03:21.060]  Oh, the big crane thing.
[03:21.340 --> 03:22.820]  Yeah, so we can all
[03:23.680 --> 03:24.300]  break off.
[03:24.320 --> 03:25.480]  We all have a big crane.
[03:26.200 --> 03:29.300]  You see these like concrete slabs around here?
[03:29.380 --> 03:31.020]  Oh, yeah, Geoff, you're doing it.
[03:31.280 --> 03:31.920]  So you got to pull.
[03:32.560 --> 03:33.700]  How do I pick it up?
[03:34.320 --> 03:36.460]  So it's you already have it latched on.
[03:37.040 --> 03:39.840]  And then let's go crane control.
[03:40.020 --> 03:41.480]  Maybe it's.
[03:41.600 --> 03:43.780]  Rope length doesn't seem to do anything.
[03:44.340 --> 03:45.260]  Oh, maybe that it is.
[03:45.460 --> 03:47.220]  I just had so much rope length.
[03:47.360 --> 03:48.080]  OK, I see.
[03:48.080 --> 03:49.160]  There you go.
[03:50.160 --> 03:50.400]  I see.
[03:50.440 --> 03:52.720]  You got to get it in that yellow resource square.
[03:53.600 --> 03:54.640]  Toggle anchors.
[03:54.840 --> 03:57.980]  OK, crane control.
[03:59.500 --> 04:01.480]  This is crane control.
[04:02.120 --> 04:03.160]  Deranged time.
[04:03.960 --> 04:04.960]  Does this thing not move?
[04:05.020 --> 04:06.480]  Can I not drive this fucking car?
[04:08.940 --> 04:10.140]  You should be able to.
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.640]  Low gear on.
[04:13.460 --> 04:16.040]  When you get stuck in the mud, I'm not stuck.
[04:16.040 --> 04:16.960]  I just have my fucking.
[04:17.900 --> 04:22.940]  Can I get this freaking notification deal off of my screen?
[04:23.780 --> 04:24.380]  Fold crane.
[04:24.560 --> 04:27.680]  OK, but that's load.
[04:29.520 --> 04:30.320]  Toggle attachment.
[04:31.740 --> 04:33.360]  So, Andrew, I just want to drive.
[04:33.640 --> 04:34.940]  OK, is your brake on?
[04:35.000 --> 04:35.880]  Is your parking brake on?
[04:36.100 --> 04:37.280]  No. OK, that was it.
[04:38.780 --> 04:41.080]  The one I know it sounds like parking brake, but it wasn't.
[04:41.140 --> 04:42.280]  It was toggling anchors.
[04:43.040 --> 04:43.960]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[04:43.960 --> 04:45.540]  The anchors will Geoff.
[04:46.000 --> 04:46.940]  I know I'm trying to.
[04:47.240 --> 04:47.720]  Yeah. One sec.
[04:47.740 --> 04:52.260]  I'm just going this way and then I move concrete slabs to the loading area.
[04:52.720 --> 04:53.800]  Where the fuck are they?
[04:53.980 --> 04:55.340]  OK, yeah. Get on up in here.
[04:55.460 --> 04:56.940]  Oh, they're off to the side. Yeah.
[04:57.880 --> 05:01.640]  And then crane function toggle attach mode.
[05:02.440 --> 05:04.540]  Then there are boom vertical.
[05:05.280 --> 05:09.900]  OK, if you're having a hard time gripping it, you can cycle and it'll lock on for you.
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.920]  OK, now toggle attach mode.
[05:16.320 --> 05:19.120]  Another thing I'd recommend is that you guys go into your settings
[05:19.120 --> 05:21.320]  and switch it to prefer frame rate over.
[05:23.180 --> 05:27.800]  OK. OK, now boom forward.
[05:32.980 --> 05:36.000]  Oh, and then performance.
[05:36.220 --> 05:38.360]  There we go. Detach load.
[05:38.700 --> 05:40.940]  Oh, God, it looks so much better. Did I do it?
[05:42.100 --> 05:45.460]  As it's it, it like melts into the square,
[05:45.460 --> 05:47.720]  I think it needs to be more in the square, Geoff. OK.
[05:49.560 --> 05:53.360]  I would adjust you got anchors down, it looks like I'd pull up your anchors,
[05:53.440 --> 05:55.160]  I'd move your truck around a little bit.
[05:55.540 --> 05:59.480]  I typically just drive the slabs in and then detach once it's fully in the square.
[05:59.620 --> 06:01.360]  How do you get them to attach?
[06:04.700 --> 06:07.580]  So move your boom a little bit.
[06:07.880 --> 06:13.140]  Uh-huh. And then do you see the lines going from your boom to the slab?
[06:13.300 --> 06:15.880]  Like it should be yellow lines or red lines.
[06:16.440 --> 06:19.080]  Yeah, I see red flashing lines.
[06:19.500 --> 06:23.220]  Hit X within. OK, got it.
[06:23.380 --> 06:26.100]  Crane function. Yeah, that may be the crane.
[06:27.160 --> 06:28.260]  Sorry about that.
[06:28.380 --> 06:29.900]  That's in crane control.
[06:30.200 --> 06:34.460]  You want a left bumper to a crane control.
[06:34.540 --> 06:36.560]  Sorry. Yeah. Crane function is like fold it.
[06:36.560 --> 06:38.580]  Crane control is cycle target.
[06:38.980 --> 06:42.840]  Oh, I see. Well, so then click X and it will automatically adjust
[06:42.840 --> 06:43.860]  into what you can grab.
[06:44.920 --> 06:47.300]  And then you push A to cycle it once it's all yellow.
[06:48.980 --> 06:50.160]  Oh, attach. OK, there we go.
[06:50.240 --> 06:52.300]  OK, I got this. I'm getting this.
[06:52.400 --> 06:53.140]  There you go.
[06:53.900 --> 06:57.960]  I don't know that I'd say I'm super enjoying it,
[06:58.340 --> 07:00.120]  but I'm definitely getting it.
[07:00.280 --> 07:01.320]  I'm definitely getting it now.
[07:01.480 --> 07:03.340]  Listen, you got to plant a seed with these games.
[07:03.400 --> 07:05.500]  You had the truck boys with you when you're first starting.
[07:05.500 --> 07:06.520]  I know a truck.
[07:06.600 --> 07:08.260]  And, you know, it's not fair to any other game.
[07:08.300 --> 07:10.520]  Trucks is just there's something magical about that game
[07:10.520 --> 07:11.840]  that you feel immediately.
[07:12.080 --> 07:14.300]  You know, my camera is so high.
[07:14.820 --> 07:16.060]  God. Oh, my God.
[07:17.860 --> 07:18.960]  So got it.
[07:21.220 --> 07:23.340]  OK, but we've done that objective complete.
[07:23.480 --> 07:23.940]  There we go.
[07:24.560 --> 07:26.340]  So now we just look for another objective, I guess.
[07:26.780 --> 07:28.100]  So now we need to create a course.
[07:29.000 --> 07:30.480]  Oh, I think I already did that.
[07:31.300 --> 07:33.900]  OK, so back to the garage.
[07:33.900 --> 07:35.460]  I have a better idea.
[07:35.960 --> 07:37.280]  Go back to garage, you say?
[07:37.740 --> 07:39.160]  I am. That's what I'm going to do.
[07:39.940 --> 07:42.060]  What's your what's your vehicle you ride around in?
[07:42.320 --> 07:46.920]  I have a Hummer, but I it's DLC, so mainly a truck.
[07:47.680 --> 07:48.980]  To be driving around in a truck.
[07:49.860 --> 07:53.320]  OK, Geoff has deployed AI and he's in the way.
[07:53.440 --> 07:55.800]  Or Nick is. Nick's blocking up the AI truck.
[07:57.460 --> 07:58.680]  OK, how do I?
[07:59.220 --> 08:00.400]  Oh, here we go. Recover.
[08:01.340 --> 08:05.300]  OK. To forward base, right?
[08:05.860 --> 08:08.400]  Yeah, I got steel beams.
[08:08.480 --> 08:09.740]  We got concrete slabs.
[08:11.000 --> 08:11.560]  What's up, bitches?
[08:12.040 --> 08:14.960]  Hey, no tracked objective.
[08:15.300 --> 08:16.920]  Use map to track an objective.
[08:17.340 --> 08:19.320]  What what objective are you tracking, Andrew?
[08:19.720 --> 08:22.500]  So go to create a route to deliver the generator.
[08:22.920 --> 08:25.660]  Yeah. And then click A again on that.
[08:26.040 --> 08:28.460]  OK, and then click A again to open it.
[08:29.200 --> 08:30.760]  OK, and start plotting.
[08:32.440 --> 08:36.540]  And so you see you click, you click that white circle, Geoff.
[08:37.220 --> 08:39.540]  Am I doing plot route or operational?
[08:40.060 --> 08:41.680]  All awards. OK, plot route.
[08:41.780 --> 08:44.660]  I see. And then I'm putting at a point.
[08:45.160 --> 08:46.140]  Oh, I see on the circle.
[08:46.760 --> 08:49.740]  So you got to try to make a route for the trucks to drive
[08:49.740 --> 08:52.560]  and they will constantly be going and giving you resources.
[08:53.220 --> 08:55.120]  Another player is editing the route, it says.
[08:55.400 --> 08:56.620]  Oh, it says another player's editing.
[08:56.900 --> 08:57.620]  Yeah, so you do it, Geoff.
[08:57.620 --> 08:59.680]  I'll let you pick your look.
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.900]  I'll back out. Start plotting. OK.
[09:03.940 --> 09:06.460]  And then you have to go from there to.
[09:08.700 --> 09:10.000]  Wherever it's telling you to go.
[09:10.700 --> 09:14.600]  Yeah, I feel like I did this one like the first night I played it.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.940]  Yeah. So you have one currently going from your forward base to the phosphate plant.
[09:20.400 --> 09:24.440]  Now you need to get one going from the abandoned facility to the phosphate plant.
[09:25.080 --> 09:26.160]  And then what do we do?
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.880]  Then it will send out trucks that are automated and they will have to try to get there.
[09:32.180 --> 09:35.440]  And if they do, then we complete the objective and we go on to the next thing.
[09:36.760 --> 09:39.920]  So we're relying on the A.I.
[09:39.920 --> 09:43.880]  to figure it out somewhat, but we'll eventually gain the ability
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.000]  to like make roads and clear the road so like they will get obstructed
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.560]  and then we will have to create a road for them or clear the path.
[09:53.020 --> 09:54.560]  All right. It looks like they're going.
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.280]  Now we just watch them from the top down, I guess we can.
[09:58.440 --> 10:01.180]  Yeah. Or we can drive over and try to help. Let's see.
[10:02.880 --> 10:04.320]  All right. A few things over there.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.660]  They're over at the abandoned facility.
[10:07.620 --> 10:08.820]  All right. I see him leaving.
[10:09.600 --> 10:11.720]  Oh, they're coming from there. I see.
[10:11.900 --> 10:13.520]  Well, let's go. Let's go check him out.
[10:13.580 --> 10:14.660]  Yeah, let's go say hi.
[10:19.380 --> 10:20.100]  Man, I
[10:20.100 --> 10:25.220]  uh, if these motherfuckers ask for one more,
[10:25.480 --> 10:27.360]  dude, I've been having a fucking day
[10:29.140 --> 10:30.660]  with the business side of our company.
[10:31.120 --> 10:32.760]  Oh, really? Dude.
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.580]  Dude, it's just like this health insurance and this dental
[10:36.580 --> 10:38.260]  that Eric has mostly been taken care of.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.360]  Every time they say it's the last thing they need, then it's like out of the blue.
[10:43.380 --> 10:45.280]  They're like, oh, by the way, you have to sign this and date this.
[10:45.300 --> 10:47.320]  And I need a letter from your bank and I need it by noon.
[10:47.440 --> 10:49.520]  Or there's you'll never get insurance.
[10:49.520 --> 10:52.040]  And you're like, you told me last week that we were done.
[10:52.960 --> 10:56.640]  It is your fault for signing up with Mission Impossible insurance, though.
[10:56.860 --> 10:58.060]  That is on you.
[10:59.060 --> 11:00.520]  Did choose to accept it.
[11:00.960 --> 11:02.880]  My insurance cards keep self-destructing.
[11:03.360 --> 11:03.980]  Oh, man.
[11:04.420 --> 11:07.960]  So we also have a side objective if we want to head that way to unlock.
[11:08.880 --> 11:09.860]  It's select. Oh, yeah.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.520]  Go connect the warehouse for base.
[11:12.960 --> 11:14.420]  We just have to drive over there.
[11:14.720 --> 11:16.600]  So we drive over there and then it's going to be a thing
[11:16.600 --> 11:18.740]  where you have to plot a route again once you're there. OK.
[11:18.740 --> 11:23.020]  Uh, let's get a low gear, stay in four wheel drive.
[11:23.100 --> 11:24.240]  All right. I'm on my car. I'm headed.
[11:24.580 --> 11:26.620]  I'm with Nick. Yeah, we're getting close to it.
[11:27.340 --> 11:28.440]  Oh, you guys are already on your way there.
[11:29.140 --> 11:31.000]  OK. A route failed, Geoff.
[11:31.400 --> 11:32.780]  So I think they got stuck.
[11:32.860 --> 11:34.300]  Seems like the route you plotted has failed.
[11:34.660 --> 11:37.620]  Let's open the infrastructure panel and check out what went wrong.
[11:38.800 --> 11:40.980]  Can we winch any of this stuff out of the way?
[11:40.980 --> 11:42.720]  There's crap in the way, it looks like, maybe.
[11:42.960 --> 11:45.700]  Yeah, but we can't winch most of it.
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.060]  We can winch these crates, but they're not the main problem.
[11:48.460 --> 11:50.060]  Oh, it's yeah, it's stuck.
[11:50.180 --> 11:51.760]  It's where you guys are is where it failed.
[11:52.180 --> 11:53.160]  Yeah. What can I do?
[11:53.160 --> 11:54.700]  What do I do about big obstruction?
[11:54.880 --> 11:57.540]  Maybe try a different route, possibly.
[11:58.280 --> 11:59.480]  All right, I'm going to clear the route.
[12:00.240 --> 12:00.720]  Start over.
[12:01.480 --> 12:03.340]  Can we send them around this big ass building?
[12:03.440 --> 12:04.340]  Let's look on the other side, Andrew.
[12:04.900 --> 12:05.260]  Sure.
[12:06.660 --> 12:08.160]  I'm going a totally different way.
[12:09.280 --> 12:09.900]  Let's see.
[12:10.080 --> 12:12.280]  Well, it looks like it's kind of underwater.
[12:13.360 --> 12:14.040]  How underwater?
[12:14.640 --> 12:15.780]  Yeah. Check the sea.
[12:15.780 --> 12:17.760]  You can ping, Geoff, or Nick.
[12:18.300 --> 12:20.340]  Hold left bumper and you can do a terrain scanner.
[12:21.300 --> 12:22.140]  Left bumper.
[12:23.120 --> 12:23.900]  Oh, okay, I see.
[12:23.940 --> 12:26.660]  Click B and then it'll tell you how dangerous it is.
[12:28.180 --> 12:30.780]  That seems bad over there, but maybe that'll work.
[12:31.100 --> 12:31.940]  I like the rain.
[12:32.180 --> 12:33.200]  This looks pretty underwater.
[12:33.320 --> 12:34.420]  It says, warning, deep water.
[12:34.720 --> 12:36.660]  Okay, well then, maybe not ideal.
[12:37.020 --> 12:37.560]  What about this way?
[12:39.300 --> 12:40.640]  This way is not looking bad.
[12:45.320 --> 12:48.380]  I mean, a little bit of yellow, but overall...
[12:48.400 --> 12:49.520]  I like the rain.
[12:50.320 --> 12:51.680]  Environmental effects are cool.
[12:52.560 --> 12:53.320]  That is cool.
[12:54.420 --> 12:56.460]  I feel like I'm getting the hang of driving this car,
[12:56.620 --> 12:57.280]  by the way, Nick.
[12:57.380 --> 12:59.360]  I feel like after a while, you just kind of...
[12:59.800 --> 13:00.460]  You dial in.
[13:00.680 --> 13:02.260]  I've been...
[13:02.260 --> 13:05.400]  So far, the easiest way to drive it seems to be
[13:06.100 --> 13:09.500]  with four-wheel drive on, not diff lock and not low.
[13:10.280 --> 13:11.700]  I think also...
[13:11.700 --> 13:12.380]  And adjusting accordingly.
[13:13.040 --> 13:15.560]  Changing to performance mode has made it...
[13:15.560 --> 13:17.180]  Oh, where do I do that?
[13:17.300 --> 13:17.600]  Settings?
[13:17.600 --> 13:18.640]  Yeah, settings.
[13:19.680 --> 13:20.160]  Game?
[13:21.300 --> 13:22.520]  Was it game?
[13:23.540 --> 13:25.480]  Yes, graphics mode on game.
[13:25.480 --> 13:26.200]  Okay, switched it.
[13:27.480 --> 13:27.660]  Okay.
[13:28.020 --> 13:28.880]  It just feels better.
[13:30.960 --> 13:32.260]  The fuck am I stuck on?
[13:33.340 --> 13:34.240]  What is this?
[13:34.880 --> 13:35.660]  Oh, I see.
[13:36.680 --> 13:39.040]  So it sounds like our boys are doing just fine.
[13:40.740 --> 13:41.380]  Let's see.
[13:41.600 --> 13:42.340]  What do we got going?
[13:43.260 --> 13:44.780]  Oh yeah, they're trucking.
[13:44.880 --> 13:45.840]  Good job, Geoff.
[13:47.100 --> 13:47.840]  Hell yeah.
[13:48.600 --> 13:49.000]  Okay.
[13:49.620 --> 13:50.800]  So let's do this side quest.
[13:50.800 --> 13:51.600]  What route did you have him go?
[13:52.920 --> 13:55.900]  He did a little right thing that I like.
[13:56.320 --> 13:58.840]  I didn't even see that when I did my run of this.
[13:59.380 --> 13:59.920]  That's a good call.
[14:00.920 --> 14:02.180]  Oh, you're talking about how I got the guys up?
[14:02.520 --> 14:02.740]  Yeah.
[14:03.100 --> 14:04.240]  I'm looking at the path you picked.
[14:04.320 --> 14:05.080]  That was great.
[14:05.940 --> 14:06.420]  That's cool.
[14:07.680 --> 14:09.640]  So let's go to this side one.
[14:10.380 --> 14:11.960]  Looks like, Geoff, you're pretty close to it.
[14:12.300 --> 14:13.180]  Trying to.
[14:14.100 --> 14:14.900]  A little hairy up here.
[14:15.000 --> 14:15.620]  All right, here we go.
[14:16.260 --> 14:17.480]  I'm out of the mud.
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.100]  Oh, boy.
[14:19.240 --> 14:19.780]  Catching up to you, Nick.
[14:20.280 --> 14:21.000]  All right.
[14:21.120 --> 14:22.120]  Trouble here.
[14:23.620 --> 14:24.300]  You're in trouble, War.
[14:24.560 --> 14:25.720]  Well, let's see.
[14:25.820 --> 14:29.060]  Let's see how powerful this scout is.
[14:29.240 --> 14:29.940]  Oh, OK.
[14:31.280 --> 14:32.620]  So far, so good.
[14:34.760 --> 14:37.180]  Look like I'm in the land of dinosaurs over here.
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.000]  Oh, here we go.
[14:43.000 --> 14:43.900]  I want to be up on this.
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.860]  This is where I want to get off.
[14:53.140 --> 14:54.000]  Oh, hello.
[14:54.600 --> 14:55.160]  Oh, hello.
[14:57.780 --> 14:58.340]  Nice.
[14:59.060 --> 15:01.160]  The truck, as you said, made it.
[15:01.540 --> 15:02.600]  Forging my own path.
[15:03.460 --> 15:08.020]  What do you think is the appropriate age to show a kid Jurassic Park?
[15:08.620 --> 15:10.500]  Oh, God. Two.
[15:13.180 --> 15:17.340]  OK, I watched it when I was probably like eight
[15:17.340 --> 15:20.760]  and I was very scared, but I was able to watch it.
[15:20.880 --> 15:23.920]  I was, but also look at Andrew, you know, that you know what?
[15:24.220 --> 15:25.320]  That's a great point.
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.400]  The vehicle failed, failed around again, failed.
[15:30.440 --> 15:31.040]  Where did it fail?
[15:31.340 --> 15:32.060]  Where did it fail?
[15:32.200 --> 15:34.380]  This could be a thing where we need to like, oh, yeah.
[15:34.440 --> 15:36.380]  So it's like a gate is closed, I'm assuming.
[15:36.560 --> 15:38.000]  Or are you shitting me?
[15:38.680 --> 15:39.840]  Is that something you guys can take care of?
[15:39.840 --> 15:41.020]  I'm almost done. Yeah, we can.
[15:41.080 --> 15:41.780]  We can take care of that.
[15:42.240 --> 15:43.460]  I just love the idea.
[15:43.740 --> 15:44.940]  Drive right into this fucking building.
[15:44.940 --> 15:48.780]  Idiot of these dudes having driven all the way from the abandoned factory
[15:48.780 --> 15:52.380]  and being gates closed, go back. Yeah.
[15:52.380 --> 15:54.140]  I think it was padlocked.
[15:54.160 --> 15:55.220]  What were we supposed to do?
[15:55.940 --> 16:00.340]  So you said another path and Nick and I will go deal with that.
[16:00.420 --> 16:03.400]  Nick, you want to try to turn around or probably.
[16:03.540 --> 16:04.560]  Yeah, you guys do that.
[16:04.600 --> 16:06.240]  I'll plot this new route.
[16:06.900 --> 16:09.580]  So go to the garage and retrieve your vehicle.
[16:10.040 --> 16:13.400]  So you retain it and then redeploy.
[16:13.400 --> 16:15.680]  So it's like half the trip is done already.
[16:17.760 --> 16:18.280]  All right.
[16:18.420 --> 16:19.220]  Where am I going to? Garage?
[16:19.560 --> 16:20.660]  This way. Retain.
[16:21.660 --> 16:22.020]  Deploy.
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.000]  OK. Track.
[16:25.400 --> 16:26.640]  So where did it go wrong?
[16:28.920 --> 16:31.160]  So the gate looks like it was closed in.
[16:31.520 --> 16:32.140]  Yeah. Where's it going?
[16:32.340 --> 16:33.860]  We just got to get to the gate.
[16:34.400 --> 16:35.560]  Is it going to the phosphate plant?
[16:35.920 --> 16:36.860]  Yeah, it's going phosphate.
[16:37.720 --> 16:40.300]  I'm going to get good at this game, but it's going to take a while.
[16:40.500 --> 16:42.800]  It's like it's weird because it's like you got to learn a new game
[16:42.800 --> 16:44.300]  and these games are always a little complicated,
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.340]  but you also have to like unlearn so much knowledge from the other games.
[16:49.280 --> 16:51.080]  Dude, yeah. In essence.
[16:53.100 --> 16:54.640]  OK, let's see how that goes.
[16:55.540 --> 16:57.920]  I feel like I'm always relearning trucks when we do it,
[16:58.100 --> 17:01.600]  and I felt like I finally had a grasp and now that's going to be gone.
[17:03.600 --> 17:06.520]  Yeah, it's hard to remember when you play it once every three or four months.
[17:06.660 --> 17:06.900]  Yeah.
[17:07.920 --> 17:10.060]  And it's truly unlearning because it's simplified.
[17:10.420 --> 17:11.720]  This is an easier trucks game.
[17:12.360 --> 17:15.020]  This may not. No, there's got to be a gate here.
[17:15.760 --> 17:17.120]  So now I go right.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.700]  We're opening the gate for you, Geoff,
[17:21.780 --> 17:24.460]  so you can redeploy that run that failed in a moment.
[17:25.960 --> 17:30.840]  Thanks, I'm I'm watching you guys from the eye in the sky.
[17:31.360 --> 17:31.800]  Hell, yeah.
[17:32.540 --> 17:33.660]  The eye in the sky.
[17:35.980 --> 17:37.120]  Winch. Winched it.
[17:40.260 --> 17:40.940]  Opening it.
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.340]  Yeah. Oh, oh, the trucks are forming on me.
[17:44.360 --> 17:45.560]  The eagles are dispatching.
[17:45.880 --> 17:46.800]  You better get out of the way.
[17:48.560 --> 17:49.240]  Oh, stop.
[17:49.600 --> 17:51.140]  I got to winch Nick out of the way.
[17:51.420 --> 17:52.800]  Nick, we have a new obstacle.
[17:53.260 --> 17:55.060]  I got a notification as that happened.
[17:55.140 --> 17:56.340]  It would let me exit it.
[17:58.140 --> 18:01.620]  OK, so if you hit select and then go to.
[18:02.240 --> 18:03.860]  Do you see the one that says ten to ten?
[18:04.860 --> 18:06.220]  Hold on just a second. I want to watch that go through.
[18:06.820 --> 18:07.040]  Sure.
[18:07.040 --> 18:08.940]  I want to I want to see the satisfaction.
[18:10.200 --> 18:13.900]  I can't go into the go into the go into the factory, buddy.
[18:13.980 --> 18:17.840]  Go into the Fyad Al Harbi trading company.
[18:19.140 --> 18:21.400]  Oh, yeah. Go deep in.
[18:21.480 --> 18:22.020]  I'm about to.
[18:22.520 --> 18:25.180]  He's getting deep up in deep in.
[18:25.500 --> 18:26.740]  Drop your load.
[18:27.340 --> 18:28.780]  Oh, he's a load dropping.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.440]  Oh, I love it. OK.
[18:31.200 --> 18:32.640]  Hit select select.
[18:33.180 --> 18:35.140]  And you see where it says remaining reward.
[18:35.240 --> 18:35.800]  Ten of ten.
[18:36.700 --> 18:37.580]  Remaining reward.
[18:37.620 --> 18:38.380]  Is that an objectives?
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.220]  Yes. And objectives.
[18:41.900 --> 18:42.780]  Or no, sorry.
[18:42.940 --> 18:44.120]  Infrastructure going to infrastructure.
[18:44.340 --> 18:44.880]  Uh-huh.
[18:46.020 --> 18:47.780]  And then do you see where it says ten of ten?
[18:47.940 --> 18:49.040]  Yeah. Or like remain reward.
[18:49.260 --> 18:54.720]  That tells you like how many deliveries need to happen for it to process.
[18:55.140 --> 18:59.180]  I see every time a truck unloads, it'll go like nine of nine and then eight of eight.
[18:59.260 --> 19:04.420]  And you can just say we just need ten trucks to fully unload.
[19:04.900 --> 19:05.340]  Uh-huh.
[19:06.440 --> 19:07.160]  Uh-huh.
[19:07.520 --> 19:08.660]  That's hot. I love it.
[19:08.700 --> 19:10.360]  It'll make things easier for you in the long run.
[19:11.460 --> 19:14.580]  So after that's done, we get a new we get a new mission.
[19:15.760 --> 19:17.060]  Uh, we have one.
[19:17.260 --> 19:19.020]  Oh, here you go. Do the side mission.
[19:20.400 --> 19:22.720]  Oh, yeah, that's what you currently were doing of connecting the warehouse
[19:22.720 --> 19:23.700]  to the forward base.
[19:23.760 --> 19:26.240]  It's been it's been done. Remove it.
[19:28.380 --> 19:29.680]  You got to bring driving.
[19:29.820 --> 19:30.780]  I can see him on the mini map.
[19:31.200 --> 19:33.160]  We got to bring resources to the zone.
[19:33.700 --> 19:37.440]  So, yeah, you re-swap the concrete boys.
[19:37.720 --> 19:39.320]  We concrete and steel beams. OK.
[19:39.780 --> 19:41.380]  And then head over to Nick and I.
[19:41.520 --> 19:44.920]  I want you two to do this because it's to me where it's like, oh, yeah,
[19:44.920 --> 19:46.180]  this is this is good.
[19:46.580 --> 19:48.680]  This is a good truck. Recover to the garage.
[19:49.060 --> 19:50.960]  And then meet up with Nick and I.
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.260]  We're essentially at the point in which what vehicle should I be in?
[19:56.180 --> 19:57.780]  Something that you can travel easily.
[19:58.140 --> 20:01.740]  So like, OK, so the the starting truck is fun. Yeah. OK.
[20:02.640 --> 20:05.380]  All right. And I'm supposed to meet you guys somewhere.
[20:05.800 --> 20:07.640]  Yeah, we're at the phosphate plant.
[20:08.760 --> 20:10.400]  Oh, yeah, I got it. I'll head that way.
[20:10.540 --> 20:14.280]  So let's get out of the path, Nick, and then we can just wait for Geoff.
[20:14.800 --> 20:15.160]  Got it.
[20:19.420 --> 20:21.560]  I don't even know if that is hanging out here.
[20:22.200 --> 20:23.080]  Is that like, actually,
[20:23.760 --> 20:26.060]  dude, I'm fishtailing all around today.
[20:26.440 --> 20:29.700]  I take I take back what I said about the controls getting better.
[20:29.780 --> 20:30.920]  They got worse all at once.
[20:30.920 --> 20:34.600]  Uh, I watch you and I can tell you, so you got to go left.
[20:34.760 --> 20:36.060]  OK, I got to go left here.
[20:37.360 --> 20:40.420]  I'm I'm glad that they handled the the map in the same way
[20:40.420 --> 20:42.900]  that SnowRunner does, because that is a brilliant use of a map.
[20:43.320 --> 20:44.940]  It's such a cool map. Yeah.
[20:46.280 --> 20:48.680]  I understand the road and I'll tell you when you have to go right.
[20:51.960 --> 20:53.560]  Trucks is coming in. Copyright strike.
[20:56.180 --> 20:57.180]  Not second strike.
[20:57.300 --> 20:58.380]  One more. We're off you to
[20:59.760 --> 21:00.940]  that fast, huh?
[21:05.960 --> 21:06.720]  There he comes.
[21:06.940 --> 21:07.920]  You're going so fast.
[21:08.240 --> 21:09.000]  You're flying.
[21:09.620 --> 21:10.420]  I'm a bad boy.
[21:11.080 --> 21:11.920]  Oh, here he comes.
[21:13.600 --> 21:15.000]  Hell yeah. OK, let's go.
[21:15.540 --> 21:16.860]  My hawk and my horn. Can you hear that?
[21:17.220 --> 21:20.660]  No. OK, I you know, I can't hear the game.
[21:20.840 --> 21:24.000]  So yeah, it doesn't seem based on that
[21:24.760 --> 21:27.660]  SnowRunner, but I guess not left stick does not seem to do anything.
[21:27.660 --> 21:29.240]  Oh, put me like a first person.
[21:29.340 --> 21:30.320]  Didn't mean to do that.
[21:30.380 --> 21:31.960]  Connect the warehouse and the forward base.
[21:32.220 --> 21:33.820]  That was the side objective you just did.
[21:34.060 --> 21:35.360]  Yeah, we did. Hell yeah.
[21:35.980 --> 21:37.340]  All right. And now we're here.
[21:37.800 --> 21:41.740]  So open is tracked.
[21:43.400 --> 21:46.640]  Where is the vehicle for this that we need?
[21:48.560 --> 21:49.960]  Oh, we got to bring resources.
[21:50.140 --> 21:51.120]  I'm a fucking idiot.
[21:51.240 --> 21:52.220]  I'm so sorry.
[21:54.120 --> 21:55.980]  Back to the garage.
[21:56.580 --> 21:56.920]  Back to the garage.
[21:57.220 --> 21:59.080]  Should we just return or drive?
[21:59.660 --> 22:01.300]  Return. And it's so much faster.
[22:01.660 --> 22:02.820]  Back to the forward base.
[22:03.100 --> 22:04.380]  Back to the FOB.
[22:04.860 --> 22:05.720]  So do we switch vehicles?
[22:05.980 --> 22:09.400]  Yeah. Do you have the Varon 3-3-2-7?
[22:11.580 --> 22:16.560]  No, I have the Scout, the Mule rusty cargo truck,
[22:17.140 --> 22:20.240]  a Baikal crane and the Kronenwerk dozer.
[22:20.360 --> 22:21.320]  I assume it's the crane.
[22:22.040 --> 22:24.040]  The crane? You hop in that crane of yours.
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.080]  That fucking thing.
[22:25.160 --> 22:29.520]  OK. And I take the mule.
[22:30.760 --> 22:32.140]  Well, I mean, here's another Varon.
[22:32.240 --> 22:33.840]  Are you sure you can't just click this Varon?
[22:34.060 --> 22:35.080]  That's like right here.
[22:35.620 --> 22:37.120]  Where? You talking to him or me?
[22:38.180 --> 22:40.400]  Me? Oh, me talking to you.
[22:40.540 --> 22:41.700]  I'm talking to you.
[22:42.540 --> 22:44.920]  Or Nick. Either of you see this vehicle in front of me.
[22:44.980 --> 22:46.040]  This is the one I'm using.
[22:46.260 --> 22:47.500]  Oh, there we go. Nick's in it.
[22:47.560 --> 22:48.100]  No, that's a mule.
[22:48.940 --> 22:51.360]  OK. Well, never mind.
[22:51.660 --> 22:53.700]  Mule works. OK, Geoff, so you're going to load
[22:53.700 --> 22:55.840]  shit onto the backs of our truck.
[22:56.060 --> 22:57.960]  Oh, OK. So you got to go into crane mode.
[22:58.320 --> 22:59.500]  Let's toggle anchor.
[22:59.720 --> 23:01.720]  We need three slabs and two steel beams.
[23:02.140 --> 23:02.880]  Not a problem.
[23:05.080 --> 23:06.460]  Might be a problem. Let's see.
[23:06.840 --> 23:07.800]  It's going to take a little bit.
[23:08.140 --> 23:09.320]  We'll figure it out. Attach load.
[23:09.840 --> 23:13.900]  So we need two steel beams and three slabs.
[23:24.400 --> 23:27.120]  It's like the most precarious crane game
[23:27.120 --> 23:29.940]  I've ever seen, like you barely have the teddy bear going.
[23:30.400 --> 23:33.000]  OK, here, Geoff, I'll I'll adjust that for you.
[23:34.080 --> 23:35.620]  I got it. There we go.
[23:37.140 --> 23:40.880]  Here, I'll also back into Andrew, and that way you can just drop it between us.
[23:42.260 --> 23:43.680]  I can't go any higher with this.
[23:47.580 --> 23:48.980]  You can just swing it in.
[23:50.500 --> 23:54.300]  Yeah, mine might be a bit easier because I'm lower than Nick's.
[23:54.340 --> 23:55.320]  You can pendulum it.
[23:56.940 --> 23:58.920]  Hold on. I'm going to detach it.
[23:59.560 --> 24:01.580]  Hey, look. And then try to.
[24:04.080 --> 24:07.300]  Why won't it let me connect to the bottom of it, like the middle?
[24:08.420 --> 24:10.120]  Why do I why can I only swing it from the top?
[24:11.160 --> 24:12.460]  Did you have to do this, Andrew?
[24:13.580 --> 24:16.700]  I had the stuff loaded into my vehicle when I did this.
[24:16.840 --> 24:17.940]  There goes another truck.
[24:19.240 --> 24:20.080]  Yeah, they just keep going.
[24:21.680 --> 24:22.360]  There you go, Geoff.
[24:23.300 --> 24:24.740]  And let me get out of your way at this point.
[24:26.640 --> 24:28.960]  Yeah, I'll pull forward a little bit.
[24:33.020 --> 24:34.960]  You want to try dropping it and then see?
[24:35.280 --> 24:36.320]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[24:36.420 --> 24:38.480]  OK, here, let me drive under it. All right.
[24:42.760 --> 24:43.520]  There we go.
[24:45.340 --> 24:45.520]  OK.
[24:47.420 --> 24:48.920]  I strapped it that way.
[24:49.980 --> 24:50.700]  Hell yeah.
[24:51.340 --> 24:52.140]  Hell yeah.
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.960]  I'm going to need one more.
[24:55.140 --> 24:55.960]  Not a problem.
[24:55.960 --> 24:59.900]  Oh, man, I can't believe.
[25:00.300 --> 25:03.900]  Wow. OK, that's so stupid in the best way.
[25:05.240 --> 25:06.420]  Let me unstrap it.
[25:08.940 --> 25:10.260]  And now strap it.
[25:11.680 --> 25:12.200]  There we go.
[25:15.360 --> 25:16.940]  It's top attaching to Nick.
[25:17.500 --> 25:18.320]  There we go.
[25:21.520 --> 25:23.740]  All right. I'm trying to do this right now.
[25:23.780 --> 25:24.240]  I apologize.
[25:24.240 --> 25:26.460]  I'm trying to do this without looking at the controls now.
[25:26.500 --> 25:27.220]  I'm trying to learn them.
[25:27.580 --> 25:29.960]  That's fine. Yeah, take all the time. So.
[25:34.420 --> 25:36.940]  So should I do two steel beams in one and three concrete slabs?
[25:37.080 --> 25:38.480]  Sure. Yeah, that makes sense.
[25:38.740 --> 25:39.680]  Does the game care?
[25:39.980 --> 25:40.820]  Is it does it matter?
[25:41.380 --> 25:44.480]  It'll be easier for you, I think, to load the slabs into one truck
[25:44.480 --> 25:46.360]  as opposed to like balancing it all.
[25:46.720 --> 25:49.620]  So, yeah, give me them the beams.
[25:51.800 --> 25:52.400]  Here, let me.
[25:54.760 --> 25:55.980]  This is just fun to watch.
[25:56.660 --> 25:58.100]  Uh huh. Yeah.
[26:03.290 --> 26:04.450]  Detach. OK.
[26:05.210 --> 26:05.690]  Hey.
[26:06.050 --> 26:07.790]  Oh, stop.
[26:08.790 --> 26:10.550]  OK, I'm going to go deliver this stuff.
[26:10.890 --> 26:13.430]  Now you and Nick line up for the slabs.
[26:14.230 --> 26:15.870]  All right. It's the best spot for me to go.
[26:15.990 --> 26:17.410]  Geoff, you want me to stay here?
[26:17.590 --> 26:20.810]  Why don't you stay where you are for right now and let me see.
[26:22.010 --> 26:24.070]  I can't believe if I can.
[26:25.530 --> 26:26.950]  I feel so tall.
[26:28.510 --> 26:30.950]  This must be what Shaquille O'Neal feels like.
[26:32.110 --> 26:34.530]  Do you think that's what is exactly what Shaquille O'Neal feels like?
[26:34.710 --> 26:35.950]  I've never felt bigger.
[26:37.090 --> 26:39.130]  Oh, no, it's this fucking thing.
[26:39.270 --> 26:41.170]  We don't need three of these, though, right?
[26:41.190 --> 26:42.290]  We need to get these out of the way.
[26:42.890 --> 26:44.110]  Oh, well, we need slabs.
[26:44.230 --> 26:45.190]  We need the concrete slabs.
[26:45.290 --> 26:46.330]  I don't know what you're looking at.
[26:46.710 --> 26:48.270]  So I probably shouldn't comment.
[26:49.770 --> 26:50.530]  Stupid beams.
[26:50.770 --> 26:51.730]  I was trying to get them out of the way.
[26:53.650 --> 26:55.370]  OK, I think I take them.
[26:56.070 --> 26:57.750]  You open the map just to be safe.
[26:58.710 --> 26:59.370]  Take a right.
[27:00.150 --> 27:01.530]  Oh, I still going forward.
[27:02.010 --> 27:04.030]  I promise you, I'm going as fast as I can here.
[27:04.170 --> 27:08.770]  Dude, you have to tell me I moved one concrete slab and it took me ages.
[27:11.390 --> 27:14.190]  Interesting, though, that it won't let you do the four.
[27:14.510 --> 27:19.890]  Oh, isn't there a toggle option, Andrew, to make it so that it'll do four points
[27:19.890 --> 27:20.510]  instead of one?
[27:22.050 --> 27:23.270]  Yeah, you should be able to.
[27:23.970 --> 27:27.190]  As long as you have an angle in which you can hook on to all four points,
[27:27.790 --> 27:28.610]  you can do that.
[27:29.050 --> 27:30.190]  I don't know what that means.
[27:31.170 --> 27:36.290]  So you might need to adjust your crane so it's lining up better on the slab.
[27:37.750 --> 27:40.730]  It's like right bumper and then
[27:44.310 --> 27:46.230]  crane aim toggle or something.
[27:47.410 --> 27:49.690]  Left bumper has detached load camera mode.
[27:49.830 --> 27:51.370]  I do like that camera mode.
[27:51.370 --> 27:53.190]  Attach mode. Attach mode, I think.
[27:55.310 --> 27:57.870]  Attach mode will make it so it's a four anchor points instead of one.
[27:58.010 --> 27:59.790]  It just says load attach mode at the bottom.
[28:00.010 --> 28:00.250]  I don't know.
[28:00.970 --> 28:03.990]  Oh, you two are really...
[28:03.990 --> 28:04.570]  You're bonded.
[28:05.130 --> 28:06.010]  Bless you.
[28:06.690 --> 28:11.550]  Bonded, I haven't done a single fucking thing here with Nick to help him out.
[28:12.630 --> 28:14.250]  I mean, I'm not doing much to help you out.
[28:16.030 --> 28:16.910]  Go up!
[28:19.810 --> 28:20.830]  Boom! Vertical.
[28:21.010 --> 28:22.130]  Thank you, Christ.
[28:22.370 --> 28:23.770]  I don't know why I couldn't get that to work.
[28:25.150 --> 28:25.710]  Here, we're stuck.
[28:30.350 --> 28:31.950]  It's so funny to watch.
[28:33.030 --> 28:34.270]  It's so dangerous.
[28:35.470 --> 28:37.790]  All right, Nick, here's what we're going to do.
[28:37.950 --> 28:39.470]  OK, I'm going to hold it here.
[28:39.510 --> 28:40.810]  You're going to drive under my car.
[28:40.990 --> 28:41.990]  I'm just going to drop it on you.
[28:45.520 --> 28:45.880]  Ow.
[28:59.980 --> 29:02.880]  While you do that, I'm going to get these beams out of the way for you.
[29:03.060 --> 29:04.220]  Thank you. All right.
[29:04.420 --> 29:07.620]  All right.
[29:10.490 --> 29:11.810]  Go ahead and pack that in.
[29:12.070 --> 29:13.810]  Now you should be able to strap it in.
[29:14.870 --> 29:17.290]  Uh, I hit the strap button and nothing's happening.
[29:18.410 --> 29:18.810]  OK.
[29:19.750 --> 29:20.430]  All right, hold on.
[29:20.530 --> 29:21.070]  There it goes.
[29:21.110 --> 29:21.830]  There you go.
[29:22.710 --> 29:24.490]  OK, we're going to need two more beams.
[29:24.810 --> 29:26.010]  I'm driving over to them.
[29:26.130 --> 29:26.870]  You need two more concretes.
[29:27.650 --> 29:28.550]  Two more concrete slabs.
[29:29.310 --> 29:29.750]  Yeah.
[29:29.970 --> 29:30.750]  All right.
[29:30.770 --> 29:31.610]  Look at this.
[29:31.970 --> 29:32.570]  Toggle crane.
[29:32.790 --> 29:33.110]  Look at it.
[29:33.530 --> 29:35.210]  Nick, could you drive forward a little bit, please?
[29:35.530 --> 29:37.010]  This is like me moving.
[29:37.870 --> 29:38.650]  Thank you.
[29:39.090 --> 29:40.490]  OK, and then I'm going to...
[29:40.490 --> 29:41.590]  That's another slab.
[29:42.190 --> 29:42.570]  And then...
[29:43.150 --> 29:44.410]  This is why I can't have a pickup truck.
[29:45.330 --> 29:45.770]  Catch load?
[29:46.210 --> 29:47.810]  Oh, Nick, I got it.
[29:47.850 --> 29:48.750]  I got a full load.
[29:49.630 --> 29:50.510]  Yeah, buddy.
[29:51.030 --> 29:52.570]  All right, now I go like this.
[29:53.210 --> 29:54.110]  Look at that.
[29:54.750 --> 29:55.850]  Look at this.
[29:56.550 --> 29:58.470]  And then now maybe we'll do like this.
[30:01.270 --> 30:03.050]  I can't see it.
[30:03.110 --> 30:04.910]  Am I trying to pick my own... the front of my own truck up?
[30:04.910 --> 30:06.170]  Yeah, you're lifting the front of your truck.
[30:07.490 --> 30:08.210]  That's awesome.
[30:14.990 --> 30:16.250]  I'll move out of the way here.
[30:19.350 --> 30:19.990]  There you go.
[30:20.610 --> 30:21.970]  I need to get it out from under me.
[30:22.290 --> 30:22.570]  OK.
[30:25.050 --> 30:26.310]  You just drive under it.
[30:29.910 --> 30:31.770]  OK, I'm going to back into it.
[30:32.570 --> 30:36.450]  You might want to unsecure your cargo at some point, Nick.
[30:36.770 --> 30:36.990]  I will.
[30:37.250 --> 30:39.710]  Let me just get under this first.
[30:40.350 --> 30:40.910]  And then I'll do it.
[30:41.610 --> 30:42.550]  All right, here we go.
[30:43.450 --> 30:44.130]  Unstrap. OK.
[30:47.230 --> 30:47.630]  Excellent.
[30:52.990 --> 30:56.490]  That's an insane strapping situation that I appreciate a lot.
[30:57.730 --> 30:59.330]  OK, we just got to load up one more, Geoff.
[30:59.330 --> 31:00.610]  Yeah, I'm working on it.
[31:01.190 --> 31:01.550]  Nice.
[31:02.410 --> 31:03.930]  Measure twice, strap once.
[31:04.410 --> 31:04.470]  Right?
[31:06.770 --> 31:08.330]  Let's see. Let's check your...
[31:08.330 --> 31:10.550]  Oh, I completely understand it now, Nick.
[31:10.970 --> 31:13.170]  You've explained the game to me with the attach mode.
[31:13.270 --> 31:13.510]  Thank you.
[31:13.550 --> 31:14.690]  Oh, OK. You're welcome.
[31:15.770 --> 31:17.290]  I was like, I think that's right. I don't remember.
[31:18.410 --> 31:19.310]  Yeah, there you go.
[31:19.610 --> 31:20.970]  And then attach.
[31:21.910 --> 31:22.630]  And then...
[31:23.190 --> 31:23.790]  There we go.
[31:25.750 --> 31:27.790]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[31:28.410 --> 31:29.290]  You've got to anchor yourself.
[31:29.450 --> 31:30.410]  Stop. Toggle the anchors.
[31:30.550 --> 31:32.770]  What? When did I untoggle the goddamn anchors?
[31:32.990 --> 31:33.110]  OK.
[31:34.910 --> 31:36.870]  No, no, no. Toggle back. I just did it again.
[31:37.010 --> 31:37.510]  Oh, no.
[31:38.690 --> 31:40.250]  Now I know when I did it. I did it immediately.
[31:40.530 --> 31:40.630]  OK.
[31:44.710 --> 31:46.170]  All right, we're getting it.
[31:49.050 --> 31:50.150]  Tilting that over.
[31:50.630 --> 31:54.630]  I love Andrew's like, this is when the game's really going to open up for you when you do this.
[31:54.850 --> 31:57.110]  And I go, how do I do it? And you go, I don't know. Somebody else did it for me.
[31:58.170 --> 31:59.390]  All right, detach load.
[31:59.850 --> 32:00.370]  There you go.
[32:00.610 --> 32:01.050]  Got it.
[32:01.610 --> 32:04.790]  It says cannot secure cargo, but whatever. It looks secure to me.
[32:05.030 --> 32:05.530]  You're fine, yeah.
[32:06.110 --> 32:09.350]  Hey, Geoff, do you want to hop in your truck and then we can drive on over again?
[32:09.830 --> 32:10.070]  Yeah.
[32:10.710 --> 32:11.870]  See you all over there.
[32:12.990 --> 32:16.010]  Got one of your automated trucks going too.
[32:17.930 --> 32:18.670]  Following you, Nick.
[32:20.370 --> 32:24.470]  All right, I'm going to take this a little slow around the bend.
[32:24.610 --> 32:26.590]  Yeah, I don't blame you. You got some weight.
[32:26.830 --> 32:28.250]  Oh, Nick, Nick!
[32:28.270 --> 32:29.030]  It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.
[32:29.310 --> 32:31.350]  I'm trying to catch you. I caught you, I caught you, I caught you.
[32:31.630 --> 32:33.710]  Oh, no, guys, what's going on?
[32:33.970 --> 32:36.710]  We're OK. A little heavy on the right side.
[32:36.970 --> 32:37.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:37.310 --> 32:39.410]  Pretty sure I put those slabs in perfectly.
[32:39.790 --> 32:40.390]  Calm down, automated vehicle.
[32:40.790 --> 32:42.670]  This automated truck's being a prick.
[32:43.090 --> 32:43.670]  Get off me.
[32:46.790 --> 32:48.630]  Get off my ass, you bastard.
[32:50.070 --> 32:51.250]  OK, we're good.
[32:51.390 --> 32:54.990]  Oh, OK, I'm trying to stay on your right, just in case.
[32:57.990 --> 32:58.470]  OK.
[33:00.130 --> 33:01.510]  Think I can destroy this?
[33:02.270 --> 33:02.490]  Yeah.
[33:03.850 --> 33:04.850]  Drive over it.
[33:08.130 --> 33:10.510]  Oh, drifting. OK, to the left.
[33:11.830 --> 33:13.110]  I'll be honest.
[33:14.390 --> 33:14.590]  What?
[33:14.990 --> 33:17.810]  It took a while, but by the end, I really liked that crane thing.
[33:17.810 --> 33:18.430]  That was fun.
[33:20.190 --> 33:21.850]  I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
[33:21.870 --> 33:22.990]  Thinking about it, it was good.
[33:24.190 --> 33:24.350]  OK.
[33:25.010 --> 33:28.690]  I love that the game lets you mis-pack shit like that.
[33:28.890 --> 33:30.310]  Yeah, that's it.
[33:31.330 --> 33:33.010]  Now take a left, Nick.
[33:33.710 --> 33:35.170]  SnowRunner would never, you know.
[33:36.570 --> 33:43.950]  Or you could do it, but you'd be over-packing as the game is not supposed to allow.
[33:43.950 --> 33:45.910]  This guy's being such an asshole.
[33:49.890 --> 33:53.310]  Chill out! We're going! We're doing the best we can!
[33:53.950 --> 33:56.070]  Guy's got a fucking quota, man. Come on.
[33:56.830 --> 33:57.950]  He wants to go home to his family.
[33:58.370 --> 33:59.210]  OK, go right, Nick.
[34:03.110 --> 34:04.110]  OK, I made it.
[34:04.850 --> 34:07.090]  Like, Jesus Christ, these fucking idiots.
[34:07.810 --> 34:11.570]  He almost hit me when we were about to tip over, Andrew.
[34:11.570 --> 34:12.750]  We go down this way?
[34:13.170 --> 34:13.790]  Yeah, we go down.
[34:14.490 --> 34:16.590]  So you just gotta bring into that circle, Nick.
[34:17.190 --> 34:17.970]  I like your DLC.
[34:18.910 --> 34:19.630]  Thank you.
[34:20.810 --> 34:22.050]  Have to get one of those.
[34:25.310 --> 34:25.670]  Alright.
[34:26.810 --> 34:28.210]  Cargo handling, unstrap.
[34:28.630 --> 34:30.150]  Now where do I put it? How do I do that?
[34:31.190 --> 34:31.830]  How does he do?
[34:32.590 --> 34:34.350]  I don't know why it says one of three.
[34:37.270 --> 34:38.370]  I don't like the sound of that.
[34:38.810 --> 34:39.230]  I don't either.
[34:39.230 --> 34:42.470]  Let me get my car and let me get rid of it.
[34:42.470 --> 34:43.130]  There we go.
[34:43.450 --> 34:43.850]  OK.
[34:45.530 --> 34:47.510]  Look at that phosphate plant, though.
[34:47.910 --> 34:49.390]  Whoa, look at it get built!
[34:50.470 --> 34:52.510]  You two are gonna hop in those now and control them.
[34:52.830 --> 34:53.510]  Are you serious?
[34:53.990 --> 34:54.390]  Yes.
[34:55.450 --> 35:00.150]  So now, go to your map and then you should be able to click on them and hop in.
[35:00.990 --> 35:01.490]  Oh, God.
[35:01.830 --> 35:04.150]  Is it to build a flood wall to strengthen the shore?
[35:04.450 --> 35:05.270]  I'll take the north one.
[35:09.660 --> 35:13.980]  Yes, you click Y to enter once you're both in.
[35:14.580 --> 35:14.640]  Yeah.
[35:14.720 --> 35:22.300]  OK, now you need to grab these flood wall pieces and drag them to the blue kind of marks on the wall.
[35:22.300 --> 35:23.700]  On the flood wall pieces, the...
[35:24.400 --> 35:27.500]  They're like the big cement chunks that are...
[35:27.500 --> 35:29.160]  Yeah, Geoff's already grabbing on to one.
[35:31.340 --> 35:35.500]  There's gonna be a little bit of learning curve on like learning how the crane works, but...
[35:35.500 --> 35:35.600]  Yeah.
[35:36.440 --> 35:43.460]  You're just gonna wanna drag it and it will highlight green once you're in a spot where it'll connect to the wall.
[35:44.260 --> 35:45.900]  It's pretty generous with it.
[35:46.380 --> 35:47.420]  As long as like...
[35:47.420 --> 35:47.660]  I can't really tell there.
[35:49.040 --> 35:50.840]  Oh, Geoff. That's beautiful.
[35:52.760 --> 35:54.940]  Oh, I see. So I'm gonna have to drop this.
[35:57.320 --> 35:58.940]  That looks like it should be good. There you go.
[35:59.940 --> 36:01.160]  OK, attach load.
[36:02.580 --> 36:03.540]  It hasn't...
[36:03.540 --> 36:05.080]  It snapped in for a moment.
[36:05.080 --> 36:06.020]  A second ago.
[36:06.300 --> 36:06.840]  On me?
[36:07.380 --> 36:07.980]  Yeah, on you.
[36:08.460 --> 36:09.380]  Oh, I didn't see it.
[36:13.520 --> 36:16.200]  Maybe try bringing it a little bit lower, Geoff, to the ground.
[36:17.360 --> 36:18.440]  OK, now what do I do?
[36:18.760 --> 36:19.480]  Just attach load?
[36:19.700 --> 36:20.280]  Drop it. Drop it.
[36:21.200 --> 36:22.080]  There you go.
[36:22.780 --> 36:23.200]  Hell yeah.
[36:23.280 --> 36:24.060]  Easy peasy.
[36:24.820 --> 36:26.800]  How am I supposed to rotate this thing to work?
[36:29.300 --> 36:31.540]  Left stick rotates the crane.
[36:33.420 --> 36:37.360]  Right bumper and left bumper moves the little guy out.
[36:37.440 --> 36:38.860]  OK, got one.
[36:40.000 --> 36:40.700]  Alright.
[36:44.560 --> 36:46.500]  Lower raise hook.
[36:48.420 --> 36:48.770]  Nice.
[36:57.190 --> 36:58.310]  There you go.
[36:58.650 --> 36:59.710]  Oh, I lost it.
[36:59.870 --> 37:00.930]  Oh no!
[37:02.770 --> 37:03.970]  I threw it into the ocean.
[37:04.330 --> 37:05.050]  Oh no.
[37:06.550 --> 37:07.590]  What do I do?
[37:07.590 --> 37:08.410]  Retrieve it.
[37:12.130 --> 37:13.450]  Oh, it... reset it.
[37:13.850 --> 37:14.730]  OK, perfect.
[37:15.990 --> 37:17.030]  Is that your last one, Nick?
[37:17.390 --> 37:18.570]  Yeah, I only had two.
[37:18.830 --> 37:19.010]  Good job.
[37:20.970 --> 37:21.650]  Got it!
[37:22.190 --> 37:26.170]  I would be doing much better, but I sent one of mine to the ocean somehow.
[37:29.210 --> 37:30.130]  Attach, motherfucker.
[37:31.770 --> 37:32.290]  OK.
[37:33.290 --> 37:35.490]  You don't even need to get much airlift on it, Geoff.
[37:35.530 --> 37:42.030]  You can just pull it to it and then it'll be easier to avoid another ocean launch.
[37:47.250 --> 37:48.450]  It's so cool.
[37:49.150 --> 37:50.010]  There you go.
[37:50.070 --> 37:50.950]  OK, you got one more.
[37:50.950 --> 37:52.190]  Easy peasy.
[37:55.070 --> 37:58.650]  Come on back with my... trolley?
[37:59.750 --> 38:01.170]  Get it down.
[38:01.550 --> 38:02.190]  Attach.
[38:03.210 --> 38:03.810]  Come on.
[38:04.730 --> 38:05.730]  There we go.
[38:06.870 --> 38:07.410]  And then...
[38:10.910 --> 38:12.190]  Good lift.
[38:13.590 --> 38:15.150]  And smack myself with it.
[38:17.130 --> 38:18.630]  It's the last one.
[38:19.950 --> 38:21.690]  Oh, dude, I want to do this from first person.
[38:23.730 --> 38:28.510]  There are so many buttons. Oh my God.
[38:28.670 --> 38:30.390]  And I can read them all.
[38:31.250 --> 38:32.090]  That's cool.
[38:32.970 --> 38:34.630]  Can I see the thing?
[38:34.830 --> 38:35.870]  Oh, I can see it from here too.
[38:36.170 --> 38:37.210]  My windshield wipers are going.
[38:38.350 --> 38:38.770]  Whoa!
[38:39.650 --> 38:40.290]  That rules.
[38:41.870 --> 38:42.570]  Say lower.
[38:43.010 --> 38:43.310]  Lower.
[38:43.510 --> 38:44.310]  Yep, a little bit.
[38:45.190 --> 38:46.270]  There we go.
[38:46.410 --> 38:47.270]  Did it from first person too.
[38:47.290 --> 38:47.630]  Fuck yeah!
[38:48.090 --> 38:48.410]  Hell yeah.
[38:48.790 --> 38:49.990]  OK, we protected the community.
[38:50.510 --> 38:52.130]  We are ready for this storm now.
[38:52.910 --> 38:54.090]  Do we get to see the storm?
[38:54.610 --> 38:55.510]  I think we do.
[38:55.990 --> 38:56.370]  Oh!
[38:57.070 --> 38:57.590]  Hell yes.
[39:00.330 --> 39:01.750]  Jeez Louise, that was a close one.
[39:01.790 --> 39:03.190]  I forgot that there's a lady that talks to us.
[39:03.630 --> 39:03.910]  Mhmm.
[39:06.330 --> 39:07.110]  Alright, well.
[39:07.870 --> 39:09.050]  Really, he's doing optimistic.
[39:13.510 --> 39:14.430]  Pick her up.
[39:14.550 --> 39:15.510]  Throw her into the ocean.
[39:19.010 --> 39:20.290]  All goals completed.
[39:21.330 --> 39:21.770]  Yay!
[39:22.770 --> 39:23.350]  Hell yeah.
[39:23.550 --> 39:24.550]  Hell yeah.
[39:24.830 --> 39:25.690]  Look at us.
[39:26.110 --> 39:26.870]  Fuck yeah.
[39:26.870 --> 39:27.470]  That's awesome.
[39:27.490 --> 39:27.710]  Look at us.
[39:28.050 --> 39:29.190]  And that's in the silence.
[39:29.470 --> 39:30.450]  Oh, never mind.
[39:31.830 --> 39:32.950]  Alright, I guess I won't read it.
[39:32.950 --> 39:33.290]  Sorry!
[39:33.750 --> 39:34.550]  I didn't know.
[39:34.730 --> 39:36.790]  I didn't know it skipped for all of us.
[39:37.250 --> 39:38.390]  I thought it was the game.
[39:38.970 --> 39:39.390]  Oh!
[39:39.650 --> 39:40.450]  No, that was me.
[39:40.890 --> 39:41.510]  Oh, that's awesome.
[39:41.510 --> 39:42.230]  That was me all along.
[39:42.830 --> 39:43.590]  This is great.
[39:44.170 --> 39:45.430]  We're done with the tutorial area.
[39:46.230 --> 39:47.010]  Oh, is that what this was?
[39:47.090 --> 39:48.690]  So now where do you go in the game?
[39:48.690 --> 39:51.710]  So now you should be able to...
[39:51.710 --> 39:52.910]  How do you do this?
[39:53.190 --> 39:53.650]  I don't remember.
[39:54.030 --> 39:54.890]  I've only done it once.
[39:55.050 --> 39:55.690]  So it's not...
[39:58.170 --> 39:59.850]  I think you return to hub.
[40:03.570 --> 40:04.010]  Turn...
[40:04.010 --> 40:04.970]  How do I do that?
[40:04.970 --> 40:05.250]  So hit start.
[40:05.750 --> 40:07.190]  And then go down to the bottom.
[40:07.290 --> 40:07.890]  Return to hub.
[40:08.970 --> 40:09.850]  Hit accept.
[40:12.630 --> 40:14.730]  And then we just pick another world to play together?
[40:15.130 --> 40:15.950]  I think so, yeah.
[40:16.430 --> 40:16.790]  Okay.
[40:16.790 --> 40:17.850]  Well, this was...
[40:17.850 --> 40:19.330]  I feel like this was a pretty big success.
[40:20.210 --> 40:21.550]  And I'll be honest with you, Andrew.
[40:21.690 --> 40:25.550]  I think I needed that because I was not enjoying it on my own.
[40:25.690 --> 40:29.430]  And if I hadn't played with you guys, I don't know that I would have gotten over the hump.
[40:29.810 --> 40:31.150]  There is, yeah, a definite curve.
[40:31.310 --> 40:31.950]  But yeah, it's good.
[40:32.150 --> 40:33.050]  It's a real fun game.
[40:33.150 --> 40:35.830]  I'm excited to get Gavin and Eric in here.
[40:36.230 --> 40:36.550]  Absolutely.
[40:36.850 --> 40:38.710]  Throw me to the deep end a little bit with the new map next time.
[40:39.210 --> 40:39.530]  Yes!
[40:40.170 --> 40:41.170]  It's gonna be so much fun.
[40:41.810 --> 40:42.610]  You wanna take us out, Geoff?
[40:42.930 --> 40:43.250]  Yeah.
[40:43.790 --> 40:45.070]  Thank you for listening...
[40:45.070 --> 40:45.350]  What?
[40:45.350 --> 40:48.950]  Thank you for watching another Regulation gameplay.
[40:49.170 --> 40:50.110]  You probably listened too.
[40:50.310 --> 40:50.870]  I'll tell you what.
[40:51.110 --> 40:52.410]  I'm gonna thank you for doing both.
[40:52.550 --> 40:54.570]  I'm gonna thank you for watching and for listening.
[40:54.710 --> 40:57.050]  Now, if you only did one of those two, it doesn't matter.
[40:57.150 --> 40:57.770]  Both apply.
[40:57.990 --> 40:59.710]  I'm being generous with the thanks.
[41:00.130 --> 41:02.750]  And be sure to check out the Regulation podcast.
[41:03.290 --> 41:05.810]  Check out our... what do you call it?

[41:11.810 --> 41:13.190]  And also, we're on YouTube.

[41:14.890 --> 41:16.910]  And we hope that you'll join us there.
[41:16.970 --> 41:17.950]  Alright, thank you very much.
