[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  Are we ready to start the video?
[00:01.400 --> 00:01.680]  It's me!
[00:01.880 --> 00:02.120]  In a moment?
[00:02.520 --> 00:02.780]  Yeah!
[00:06.680 --> 00:08.520]  Put that in the slideshow!
[00:09.420 --> 00:10.700]  Put that in the slideshow.
[00:10.760 --> 00:14.360]  Hello and welcome to another Doomsday Heist video.
[00:15.080 --> 00:15.340]  Hello!
[00:15.560 --> 00:16.160]  We got a finale.
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.280]  Uh, I'm accessing the finale screen right now.
[00:20.680 --> 00:22.120]  Whoa, how are you doing that?
[00:22.720 --> 00:22.940]  Run!
[00:23.760 --> 00:24.420]  How did...
[00:24.420 --> 00:27.180]  How did you go backwards vertically in a helicopter?
[00:28.400 --> 00:28.680]  Physics.
[00:28.680 --> 00:31.740]  I was hoping I would just spin around, but it never spun.
[00:31.840 --> 00:33.020]  It did not spin.
[00:33.320 --> 00:34.100]  Spin around.
[00:34.440 --> 00:36.340]  Alright, I'm ready, Andrew.
[00:36.440 --> 00:38.580]  When are you sending us the stuff, man?
[00:38.640 --> 00:39.220]  This is weird.
[00:39.360 --> 00:40.140]  Here, auto-invite.
[00:40.220 --> 00:40.620]  There we go.
[00:42.060 --> 00:44.120]  Accept the invite quick, because we're heading straight for this building.
[00:44.440 --> 00:45.500]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[00:45.660 --> 00:46.260]  Goodbye, friends!
[00:46.700 --> 00:47.480]  Oh, don't leave me free!
[00:50.400 --> 00:52.060]  Playing this mission will reset all...
[00:52.060 --> 00:52.460]  I don't give a shit.
[00:52.460 --> 00:52.700]  What?
[00:53.300 --> 00:54.740]  Oh, we got a different team?
[00:55.200 --> 00:56.540]  Are you sure you want to continue?
[00:57.180 --> 00:58.180]  Oh, you guys gotta...
[00:58.180 --> 00:59.820]  Remember it broke last time?
[01:00.500 --> 01:01.200]  Oh, right.
[01:01.280 --> 01:02.660]  So do we need to worry about this, or...
[01:02.660 --> 01:03.140]  So do we need to go back and do this?
[01:03.220 --> 01:04.140]  So do we just hit yes?
[01:04.720 --> 01:08.200]  Wait, that's just a challenge for doing the whole heist with all the same people, but...
[01:08.200 --> 01:08.780]  Because it...
[01:08.780 --> 01:10.100]  Because it broke, we won't do that.
[01:10.100 --> 01:10.520]  Oh, I don't...
[01:10.520 --> 01:11.200]  I don't care.
[01:11.780 --> 01:14.280]  Yeah, we'll have to do it again anyway when we do criminal masterminds later.
[01:14.360 --> 01:14.980]  That's true.
[01:15.340 --> 01:18.020]  Alright, and remember, Gavin, don't buy all ammo.
[01:18.660 --> 01:20.340]  It's only 150 bucks right now, though.
[01:20.480 --> 01:21.800]  But I really want to buy all the ammo.
[01:22.320 --> 01:23.880]  I think that's like, maybe fired one bullet.
[01:25.720 --> 01:29.380]  So we gotta launch an operation on a foreign submarine lurking off the coast.
[01:29.560 --> 01:29.960]  Okay.
[01:30.340 --> 01:30.740]  Okay.
[01:30.800 --> 01:32.340]  Uh, no, we gotta move some people around here.
[01:32.380 --> 01:33.320]  Oh, Nick is...
[01:33.320 --> 01:34.820]  Uh, let me go to air support and...
[01:34.820 --> 01:36.720]  Yes! Come join me!
[01:36.840 --> 01:38.200]  No bad ideas.
[01:38.560 --> 01:40.800]  So, am I on the sub-team then?
[01:40.900 --> 01:41.640]  Is that the...
[01:41.640 --> 01:43.540]  Yeah, you and Gavin on sub-team.
[01:43.760 --> 01:44.040]  Okay.
[01:44.680 --> 01:46.080]  Oh, you'd have to change, though, right?
[01:46.260 --> 01:46.800]  I don't know how to...
[01:46.800 --> 01:47.360]  How do I change?
[01:47.580 --> 01:51.760]  So click, uh, push A on air support, and then it'll flip you to...
[01:51.760 --> 01:52.380]  You can swap.
[01:52.380 --> 01:54.040]  It's just telling me that I can be ready.
[01:54.220 --> 01:56.240]  Oh, maybe I can control that. Here we go.
[01:56.680 --> 01:58.040]  Oh, damn! Do you think so?
[01:58.560 --> 01:59.540]  Looks like it.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.940]  Huh, that's so crazy.
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.220]  I would dock 5% off Eric for being a sarcastic bastard.
[02:07.220 --> 02:10.380]  Listen, if that's the fee, that's the fee.
[02:10.720 --> 02:13.840]  It feels even better to be right, so I got no problem.
[02:14.740 --> 02:15.640]  I don't know, man, 5%.
[02:15.640 --> 02:16.980]  Let's just launch the mission.
[02:18.640 --> 02:19.620]  Oh, I'm the aviator.
[02:20.640 --> 02:22.280]  Uh, mid-tech mast?
[02:22.580 --> 02:23.380]  Are those chaps?
[02:24.780 --> 02:25.500]  Damn, I look good.
[02:26.120 --> 02:29.220]  Let's see. What are we going for, guys? I think I'm going to go with the concealed.
[02:30.340 --> 02:31.460]  Oh, you look kind of like a cat.
[02:32.480 --> 02:35.100]  You kind of look like, uh, one of the three ninjas.
[02:35.340 --> 02:38.600]  That's what I thought! Andrew, that's exactly why I picked it!
[02:40.240 --> 02:42.620]  Andrew, do you get a different haircut every heist?
[02:43.140 --> 02:44.500]  I changed it once.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.320]  He also has the stache from his, uh, that long ago photo.
[02:49.680 --> 02:50.560]  Don't think I didn't notice.
[02:50.560 --> 02:53.740]  I should change my haircut every heist. It's identity reasons, Gavin. I don't want to get caught.
[02:53.860 --> 02:57.220]  Yeah, I'm used to seeing you with pink hair with all the clips I've been doing.
[02:59.720 --> 03:02.100]  Oh, I'm excited about this. What are we flying?
[03:02.100 --> 03:02.760]  Which car are we going into?
[03:03.320 --> 03:03.640]  Mine!
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.280]  Okay, which one is yours? This one?
[03:06.680 --> 03:07.140]  Uh, Kuruma.
[03:08.560 --> 03:10.040]  Wait, Gavin, I can't get in that.
[03:11.980 --> 03:14.000]  Where are we going? Oh, we're going...
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.920]  I'll put a marker down as soon as I... yeah.
[03:16.940 --> 03:17.720]  Is this your car?
[03:17.720 --> 03:21.640]  No, no, my car's the burger shot. Here, we'll get... we can take the burger shot.
[03:21.840 --> 03:22.840]  To the Avenger!
[03:23.560 --> 03:26.580]  Oh, I guess I need to go the other way? Okay, well, whatever.
[03:27.160 --> 03:28.900]  You know, it's fine, just...
[03:28.900 --> 03:29.500]  Oh, I'm driving.
[03:29.900 --> 03:30.220]  Yeah.
[03:31.340 --> 03:31.660]  What?
[03:31.960 --> 03:33.140]  Alright, follow the map.
[03:34.820 --> 03:35.980]  Oh, there it goes, it auto-spot.
[03:36.520 --> 03:37.120]  We're screwed.
[03:38.020 --> 03:39.820]  This has a gun on it, this car?
[03:40.780 --> 03:42.400]  I guess so. I think it might be Nick's.
[03:42.520 --> 03:43.940]  Why are you screwed? We just started.
[03:44.620 --> 03:45.120]  Yeah, we got it.
[03:45.120 --> 03:48.740]  No, it was just Gavin was sitting in the parked car going, oh, I'm driving.
[03:49.540 --> 03:51.760]  We're about to drive into the sea?
[03:53.580 --> 03:55.360]  I mean, you could save and cam your own clips.
[03:55.500 --> 03:56.000]  How do you do that?
[03:57.280 --> 04:00.060]  If you hold down, you can turn on action replay.
[04:01.620 --> 04:05.820]  And then you just have to hold down and press X every time you want to take a clip.
[04:06.400 --> 04:07.120]  Oh, I've missed...
[04:08.380 --> 04:10.100]  Oh, I see. Turn on action replay.
[04:12.320 --> 04:13.640]  Did you give me a mark?
[04:14.160 --> 04:15.820]  Yeah. Did you not get it?
[04:16.160 --> 04:17.800]  Yeah, I put it down.
[04:18.940 --> 04:19.940]  Here, I'll take it off and put it down.
[04:20.060 --> 04:20.420]  Okay, nice.
[04:21.800 --> 04:23.660]  I can see the blip, but not the path.
[04:25.360 --> 04:26.260]  You're not on the path?
[04:27.820 --> 04:29.740]  It won't let me put down a blip?
[04:30.220 --> 04:31.340]  It's because I put mine down.
[04:31.500 --> 04:32.400]  Oh, got it. Okay, cool.
[04:34.200 --> 04:36.580]  Andrew, we are hauling balls.
[04:36.840 --> 04:38.180]  We are killing it.
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.080]  Oh my god.
[04:41.720 --> 04:42.640]  Hold on, you butts.
[04:43.080 --> 04:43.980]  That's a nice car.
[04:44.220 --> 04:45.680]  Yeah, this James Bond car is crazy.
[04:46.200 --> 04:46.680]  What are y'all driving?
[04:47.960 --> 04:48.780]  Your car or something?
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.200]  Whoa, did you see that guy?
[04:50.340 --> 04:51.080]  Yeah, that was cool.
[04:56.960 --> 04:59.240]  There's a disturbing lack of cyclists here.
[05:01.300 --> 05:03.580]  Oh, I put my bike in the back. If you want, we can pull over.
[05:03.900 --> 05:04.460]  Oh god.
[05:04.920 --> 05:05.600]  Oh shit.
[05:05.660 --> 05:06.960]  No, I don't want to do it to you though.
[05:07.460 --> 05:08.580]  Didn't stop you before.
[05:08.960 --> 05:12.120]  Well, that was before we were... no bad ideas.
[05:13.860 --> 05:14.580]  That is fair.
[05:14.780 --> 05:17.800]  And while that wasn't a bad idea at the time, we have now bonded.
[05:17.800 --> 05:19.380]  No, I once again argue. Yeah, no bad idea.
[05:21.860 --> 05:23.760]  So what's your objective, other team?
[05:24.300 --> 05:25.520]  We're going to the Avenger.
[05:25.840 --> 05:26.180]  Yeah.
[05:26.400 --> 05:28.460]  Okay, and we're going to the Stromberg.
[05:28.820 --> 05:30.360]  Yeah, Stromberg.
[05:31.340 --> 05:33.680]  Stromberg sounds like a sandwich that would have a pickle on it.
[05:33.820 --> 05:34.720]  Like a big old...
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.160]  Yeah.
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.920]  Would be known for the pickle.
[05:37.480 --> 05:39.000]  Oh, I thought I could ramp off that.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.480]  You definitely couldn't, but I like that you tried.
[05:42.860 --> 05:44.620]  Well, no bad ideas.
[05:47.380 --> 05:49.540]  Just honk on the horn? Let everyone know?
[05:50.100 --> 05:51.000]  Yeah, press Y to honk.
[05:51.400 --> 05:51.680]  No.
[05:54.380 --> 05:57.760]  For just a second, I forgot every control on the controller.
[05:57.880 --> 05:59.040]  And I was like, well maybe he's right.
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.660]  You just dropped the controller as a response.
[06:02.040 --> 06:02.280]  Yeah.
[06:03.100 --> 06:04.060]  He's broken me.
[06:04.280 --> 06:05.240]  I don't trust myself.
[06:05.240 --> 06:05.740]  Ah!
[06:08.880 --> 06:10.080]  Almost there, maybe.
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.400]  Ah, it's good to be heisting again.
[06:12.580 --> 06:13.060]  It is!
[06:13.060 --> 06:13.420]  Yeah, it's nice.
[06:13.580 --> 06:13.840]  Right?
[06:14.600 --> 06:15.220]  Oh dear.
[06:16.360 --> 06:18.780]  I think there's one more doomsday after this, right Gavin?
[06:18.880 --> 06:19.880]  I think this is two of three?
[06:20.740 --> 06:21.060]  Yeah.
[06:21.340 --> 06:21.660]  Yeah.
[06:21.900 --> 06:25.360]  I know that there's one where you have to fight a bunch of juggernaut mofs.
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.820]  Okay, we are at the Avenger.
[06:29.580 --> 06:29.980]  Nice.
[06:30.220 --> 06:31.180]  We're getting close to the car.
[06:32.120 --> 06:33.160]  Good luck, Godspeed.
[06:36.460 --> 06:39.000]  Oh, a pilot is required to fly it.
[06:39.200 --> 06:39.780]  Good news.
[06:40.040 --> 06:40.440]  Who would've guessed?
[06:40.700 --> 06:41.980]  Good news!
[06:42.600 --> 06:44.000]  Guess what Nick is!
[06:44.100 --> 06:45.500]  He went to school for it and everything.
[06:45.500 --> 06:46.540]  I'm certified, mostly.
[06:47.580 --> 06:48.740]  Oh, I don't like...
[06:49.320 --> 06:51.880]  The mostly is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence, buddy.
[06:52.500 --> 06:52.660]  Yeah.
[06:53.480 --> 06:56.280]  Oh, it's the same car part we didn't drop them off.
[06:56.420 --> 06:56.720]  Oh.
[06:57.600 --> 06:58.620]  Oh, we could've just gone together.
[06:59.760 --> 06:59.900]  No!
[06:59.900 --> 07:00.400]  Yeah, we could've.
[07:03.980 --> 07:06.360]  Are we... do we... what are we taking?
[07:07.620 --> 07:07.980]  Stromberg.
[07:08.500 --> 07:09.600]  Which one? Is that the white car?
[07:10.100 --> 07:10.360]  Yeah.
[07:10.740 --> 07:10.960]  Okay.
[07:11.340 --> 07:13.100]  I thought the sub was called a Stromberg.
[07:13.840 --> 07:15.900]  No, the Stromberg's the subcar.
[07:16.220 --> 07:17.820]  You're Stromberging to the Stromberg.
[07:19.400 --> 07:21.420]  Hey, Eric, look over there. Look at Nick's car.
[07:22.440 --> 07:22.880]  Okay.
[07:23.380 --> 07:23.740]  Hey, Wes.
[07:24.080 --> 07:24.860]  Oh, shit!
[07:25.500 --> 07:25.940]  No!
[07:27.320 --> 07:29.460]  Nick is spinning our plane around.
[07:30.180 --> 07:31.100]  He's going back.
[07:31.920 --> 07:32.880]  He's getting revenge.
[07:40.030 --> 07:42.030]  You just point me in the direction that they're at.
[07:42.230 --> 07:44.310]  What are we... oh, we're going back in the ocean?
[07:45.990 --> 07:48.590]  Yeah, it's the car that... we did this last time.
[07:49.350 --> 07:52.470]  Yeah, you went under the sea and you shot the mines and it broke, but we did it.
[07:53.990 --> 07:57.290]  Yeah, but we're not doing something else this time. I'm just surprised we're doing it again.
[07:57.490 --> 07:59.090]  I don't remember what button it is. What button is it?
[07:59.770 --> 08:01.050]  Don't say what. What button is it?
[08:01.470 --> 08:01.870]  Okay.
[08:03.950 --> 08:06.570]  Oh, here we go. Hold right to switch.
[08:07.450 --> 08:08.690]  Did it do it? Yeah, here we go.
[08:09.930 --> 08:10.750]  Now we're cooking.
[08:11.070 --> 08:11.210]  Yeah.
[08:13.690 --> 08:14.990]  These boys are swimming now.
[08:15.150 --> 08:18.970]  It said I could put this... oh, here we go.
[08:19.390 --> 08:20.510]  Oh, engage autopilot. Perfect.
[08:23.310 --> 08:23.710]  Ooh.
[08:24.190 --> 08:25.710]  So I get to come back and shoot some stuff.
[08:27.130 --> 08:28.450]  Alright, so autopilot's on.
[08:28.990 --> 08:29.290]  Uh-oh!
[08:31.430 --> 08:33.570]  Look at... those rocks came out of nowhere. That's crazy.
[08:34.990 --> 08:35.910]  Rules of the sea, you know?
[08:36.870 --> 08:37.730]  Rules of the sea.
[08:39.390 --> 08:41.070]  First rule of the sea, we don't talk about the sea.
[08:41.650 --> 08:43.350]  Don't fucking even think about it.
[08:44.650 --> 08:46.870]  Can I get out and back in this while it's underwater, do you think?
[08:46.870 --> 08:47.110]  No.
[08:47.210 --> 08:47.430]  No.
[08:48.090 --> 08:49.770]  I don't want to drive all the way back here.
[08:51.770 --> 08:53.450]  This is not fast underwater.
[08:55.090 --> 08:57.170]  It said go to the submarine, but the submarine disappeared.
[08:57.790 --> 08:58.950]  The submarine's right in front of us.
[08:58.950 --> 09:01.430]  Oh, okay. I was waiting for it to, like, go to a cutscene or something.
[09:01.550 --> 09:03.410]  It just, like, the marker went away.
[09:04.950 --> 09:07.270]  Wait for the submarine team to enter the submarine. Still waiting.
[09:07.670 --> 09:09.590]  Okay, we're... the cutscene is playing.
[09:09.870 --> 09:10.170]  Okay.
[09:10.490 --> 09:10.790]  Cool.
[09:10.870 --> 09:11.970]  We are entering the submarine.
[09:13.070 --> 09:14.270]  We are in the submarine.
[09:14.990 --> 09:15.550]  Oh, yeah.
[09:15.710 --> 09:17.990]  Not according to the game. It lies.
[09:18.970 --> 09:19.570]  What about now?
[09:19.590 --> 09:19.830]  Here we go.
[09:20.610 --> 09:23.130]  Take out the incoming agents. Holy shit. Okay.
[09:23.810 --> 09:25.950]  Oh, I'm gonna... I'm gonna get on the up top cam.
[09:27.290 --> 09:27.570]  Sure.
[09:28.950 --> 09:31.670]  Are you... do you have a view under... on the undercarriage?
[09:31.690 --> 09:31.990]  Uh, yes.
[09:32.050 --> 09:34.110]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit. What the fuck, Gavin?
[09:34.330 --> 09:35.510]  Well, Gavin committed suicide.
[09:35.570 --> 09:36.390]  What'd you do?
[09:37.610 --> 09:39.350]  Where's the checkpoint, is the question.
[09:40.070 --> 09:41.910]  Gavin, what'd you use?
[09:42.330 --> 09:44.510]  Well, the grenade launcher, but it hit you back.
[09:44.810 --> 09:46.090]  Because you went all over the place.
[09:46.430 --> 09:48.890]  It's a... it's a... it's a submarine, man.
[09:50.470 --> 09:52.110]  Yeah, it's probably not the best weapon choice.
[09:52.110 --> 09:53.330]  Just use gun.
[09:53.790 --> 09:55.690]  Listen, I'm a questionable mofe, but man.
[10:00.070 --> 10:00.990]  Where's it putting us?
[10:01.550 --> 10:01.570]  No!
[10:02.890 --> 10:03.610]  God almighty.
[10:05.330 --> 10:06.250]  Oh, thank God.
[10:06.370 --> 10:06.590]  I'm in.
[10:06.650 --> 10:08.350]  Oh, that was the scariest...
[10:09.010 --> 10:09.970]  We're in the submarine.
[10:11.130 --> 10:11.490]  Well.
[10:11.990 --> 10:13.150]  We have to take flight again.
[10:13.950 --> 10:14.310]  Really?
[10:14.650 --> 10:16.090]  Are you at the Avenger, at least?
[10:16.150 --> 10:17.170]  Yeah, we're at the... we're on the beach.
[10:17.170 --> 10:17.470]  Yeah, we're there.
[10:17.690 --> 10:18.030]  Oh, okay.
[10:18.070 --> 10:18.990]  We gotta just fly up.
[10:19.550 --> 10:20.410]  Oh, I changed my outfit.
[10:20.410 --> 10:21.750]  Yeah, me too. What the fuck was that?
[10:22.050 --> 10:23.050]  I didn't set up for this.
[10:23.710 --> 10:27.630]  Oh, God. But here's the problem with this now, is that they're already coming towards us.
[10:29.390 --> 10:31.530]  Gavin, you gonna do... go for it?
[10:32.170 --> 10:32.550]  Yeah.
[10:32.870 --> 10:33.650]  Okay, just making sure.
[10:33.990 --> 10:36.590]  I just did a little too much last time, now I'm easing off.
[10:37.110 --> 10:39.110]  Now you're doing way less. Got it. Cool.
[10:43.670 --> 10:45.110]  Dude, they could take some punishment.
[10:45.330 --> 10:46.650]  Yeah, these guys are strong.
[10:50.210 --> 10:51.250]  And that's one down.
[10:52.470 --> 10:54.190]  I don't even see the other one.
[10:54.750 --> 10:55.550]  Oh, there it is.
[10:57.610 --> 10:59.450]  Ah! I don't wanna do that!
[11:00.350 --> 11:01.310]  I might be toast.
[11:02.010 --> 11:04.410]  I'm helping, I'm helping. I got you, I'm right behind you.
[11:07.070 --> 11:09.350]  Alright, I'm on piloting. Coming back.
[11:11.470 --> 11:13.850]  I wanna try like a machine gun or something.
[11:15.210 --> 11:15.990]  Uh, sure.
[11:18.810 --> 11:19.970]  There's that sure again.
[11:20.150 --> 11:20.850]  Alright, we're moving.
[11:23.250 --> 11:24.590]  Okay, we're moving down.
[11:24.590 --> 11:26.230]  Oh, Gavin, we're down fast.
[11:26.950 --> 11:28.570]  Ooh, what's the loot-a-mall?
[11:28.910 --> 11:30.130]  Oh, it's a nudie lady.
[11:31.210 --> 11:31.510]  Yeah?
[11:33.010 --> 11:34.030]  You guys seeing boobs?
[11:34.890 --> 11:35.250]  Try it!
[11:35.950 --> 11:36.730]  Yeah, baby!
[11:38.050 --> 11:38.930]  Ah, the cook!
[11:40.850 --> 11:42.090]  They're cooking the boobs?
[11:43.030 --> 11:43.410]  Oh no.
[11:45.210 --> 11:46.090]  Not ze breasts.
[11:46.590 --> 11:48.150]  Reminds me, I gotta go back to the vanilla unicorn.
[11:48.430 --> 11:49.390]  Ooh, nice shot, Andrew.
[11:50.190 --> 11:50.710]  Thank you.
[11:52.570 --> 11:53.010]  Shortcut!
[11:54.250 --> 11:55.570]  It's vanilla, not strawberry.
[11:57.590 --> 11:58.530]  Ah, I fell!
[11:59.250 --> 12:00.030]  He pushed me.
[12:00.370 --> 12:01.030]  Wasn't that the shortcut?
[12:01.630 --> 12:03.670]  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard?
[12:04.430 --> 12:05.730]  And they're like, yum.
[12:09.030 --> 12:10.810]  Oh god, they're blind firing at us.
[12:11.510 --> 12:12.850]  Oh, it's funny you should mention that.
[12:12.990 --> 12:14.450]  Yeah, we're kinda doing the same to them.
[12:14.870 --> 12:16.790]  That's cool. Hey, whatever it takes, you know.
[12:17.830 --> 12:18.470]  Yes, sir.
[12:18.470 --> 12:20.870]  We're still moving through, trying to find the contact.
[12:21.770 --> 12:22.530]  Yeah, no problem.
[12:22.770 --> 12:24.170]  This is pretty easy for us.
[12:24.690 --> 12:25.690]  Are you just fending off?
[12:25.690 --> 12:28.670]  We're just stationary with unlimited rockets, firing non-stop.
[12:29.810 --> 12:30.490]  Pretty cool.
[12:31.370 --> 12:33.490]  Oh, that was, wow, I hit him on, dead on.
[12:34.590 --> 12:36.190]  Sucks to suck, dickhead.
[12:36.910 --> 12:37.310]  Oh!
[12:38.610 --> 12:39.230]  Is there like a boat?
[12:39.230 --> 12:41.650]  Whoa, whoa! Those guys are right there!
[12:41.750 --> 12:42.110]  Is there a boat?
[12:43.190 --> 12:45.250]  Do you see the circle on the mini-map for like an enemy?
[12:45.350 --> 12:45.510]  Oh yeah.
[12:45.510 --> 12:47.190]  I can't tell if like somebody fell out.
[12:47.190 --> 12:47.930]  Oh!
[12:48.850 --> 12:49.910]  Andrew, did you see that?
[12:50.470 --> 12:51.550]  I missed it.
[12:51.590 --> 12:52.950]  Okay, that was awesome.
[12:53.690 --> 12:54.230]  Did you save a clip?
[12:55.810 --> 12:56.610]  Uh, yeah.
[12:58.510 --> 12:58.910]  That's...
[13:00.970 --> 13:01.370]  Yeah!
[13:02.170 --> 13:02.530]  Yeah!
[13:02.870 --> 13:03.870]  Oh, you know what, that's my shirt.
[13:08.920 --> 13:10.520]  That's the chopper that went down.
[13:10.620 --> 13:13.420]  It kinda has like this funny thing where it freaks out like this.
[13:15.300 --> 13:16.260]  Oh, that was cool.
[13:16.860 --> 13:18.540]  So if I wanted to save a clip, Gavin,
[13:18.540 --> 13:20.020]  how do I do that again, sorry?
[13:20.180 --> 13:21.120]  I turn on action replay.
[13:21.820 --> 13:22.140]  Yeah.
[13:22.460 --> 13:24.580]  Yeah, once it's on and then you just save clips.
[13:25.300 --> 13:27.360]  Hold down on the D-pad and then click A.
[13:27.380 --> 13:28.860]  What? Where are we supposed to be going?
[13:29.060 --> 13:29.880]  What am I missing?
[13:30.160 --> 13:30.820]  Yeah, I got lost.
[13:31.000 --> 13:31.740]  Who's calling me?
[13:31.860 --> 13:33.680]  Are we meant to do something in this main room?
[13:33.940 --> 13:36.320]  I don't know. No, it says find the contact.
[13:37.980 --> 13:39.540]  You took the helicopters away.
[13:39.680 --> 13:40.760]  No rush or anything.
[13:41.380 --> 13:43.740]  I would hate to be in a submarine so much.
[13:43.860 --> 13:44.020]  Yeah.
[13:44.120 --> 13:44.880]  Okay, here comes a guy.
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.540]  I miss submarine movies.
[13:46.540 --> 13:49.580]  I enjoy a good submarine movie and they don't make them anymore.
[13:50.060 --> 13:52.440]  Yeah, but that's about the only thing about a submarine I think I would enjoy.
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.140]  Wasn't The Last Mission Impossible a submarine movie?
[13:55.420 --> 13:58.760]  It starts, but they get out of the submarine really quick.
[13:59.280 --> 13:59.460]  Hmm.
[14:00.660 --> 14:01.980]  Gavin, I do not know where to go.
[14:02.840 --> 14:04.080]  Can I use the periscope?
[14:04.380 --> 14:04.640]  Damn.
[14:06.160 --> 14:07.440]  Guys, we're lost in a submarine.
[14:07.840 --> 14:10.060]  I can't tell where this...
[14:10.060 --> 14:11.040]  It says find the contact.
[14:11.260 --> 14:12.600]  It says there's one more guy to kill.
[14:13.680 --> 14:14.640]  I hear him.
[14:14.720 --> 14:15.500]  I don't see him.
[14:15.500 --> 14:15.860]  What?
[14:16.660 --> 14:17.800]  Oh, you hear him?
[14:18.060 --> 14:19.900]  Yeah, he's like yelling at me right here.
[14:20.040 --> 14:20.940]  Don't know where he's at.
[14:21.500 --> 14:22.640]  Have you tried yelling, Marco?
[14:23.460 --> 14:24.220]  Nothing in here.
[14:24.860 --> 14:25.960]  Dude, I don't...
[14:25.960 --> 14:26.900]  I don't know.
[14:28.280 --> 14:28.760]  Uh...
[14:28.760 --> 14:30.360]  Let me go down a floor.
[14:30.700 --> 14:31.760]  Yeah, try...
[14:31.760 --> 14:32.360]  Try going down.
[14:34.340 --> 14:35.000]  There he is!
[14:35.380 --> 14:36.020]  Oh, did you get him?
[14:36.260 --> 14:37.300]  Fuck, yeah, finally.
[14:37.680 --> 14:38.160]  Goddamn.
[14:38.680 --> 14:39.020]  Oh.
[14:39.560 --> 14:39.820]  Stupid.
[14:39.820 --> 14:41.160]  He's guarding the... the contact.
[14:42.220 --> 14:42.980]  He's in jail.
[14:43.580 --> 14:43.820]  Heh.
[14:44.640 --> 14:46.200]  I don't think I've ever done this side of it.
[14:46.280 --> 14:47.980]  I think I was on the air team before.
[14:49.020 --> 14:49.420]  Ooh.
[14:49.820 --> 14:50.180]  That's cool.
[14:50.560 --> 14:51.900]  Alright, aim at him, but don't shoot him.
[14:53.500 --> 14:55.360]  I'm aiming at you so good right now.
[14:55.880 --> 14:56.740]  Give me the money!
[15:10.110 --> 15:10.850]  To the bridge.
[15:11.010 --> 15:11.490]  Oh, shit!
[15:11.870 --> 15:12.370]  Yeah, that was pretty...
[15:12.370 --> 15:13.010]  Oh, look out!
[15:13.210 --> 15:14.030]  Gavin, no run!
[15:15.070 --> 15:15.850]  Oh, please don't die.
[15:15.850 --> 15:16.470]  Is that gonna blow?
[15:16.710 --> 15:17.470]  I think so.
[15:17.550 --> 15:18.310]  Please don't die.
[15:18.370 --> 15:18.850]  Did it?
[15:18.990 --> 15:19.490]  I did!
[15:19.990 --> 15:21.290]  That was so cool!
[15:21.590 --> 15:22.690]  That was, uh...
[15:23.290 --> 15:23.730]  Woo!
[15:24.830 --> 15:25.710]  That was crazy!
[15:28.030 --> 15:32.290]  Meanwhile, Nick and I are just continuing to mash the right trigger, shooting infinite missiles.
[15:32.590 --> 15:33.430]  Good, keep doing it!
[15:33.550 --> 15:34.050]  You're doing great!
[15:34.730 --> 15:35.970]  We're going back to the control room.
[15:36.130 --> 15:36.310]  Yep.
[15:37.030 --> 15:37.890]  We're almost there.
[15:38.490 --> 15:39.970]  Is it full of men now, though?
[15:41.470 --> 15:42.870]  It's full of men!
[15:44.290 --> 15:44.730]  Hallelujah.
[15:45.370 --> 15:45.810]  Yeah.
[15:49.090 --> 15:51.230]  Alright, I'm taking pictures of the screen.
[15:51.450 --> 15:52.390]  I'll make sure nobody comes.
[15:52.690 --> 15:54.310]  I'll make sure nobody comes.
[15:54.310 --> 15:54.710]  Wow, ooh!
[15:55.150 --> 15:55.710]  On the bridge?
[15:55.870 --> 15:56.130]  Be careful.
[15:56.610 --> 15:57.270]  It's full of men.
[15:57.270 --> 15:57.830]  It's a room full of men.
[15:59.370 --> 16:00.890]  You gotta watch what you say.
[16:01.530 --> 16:02.410]  Hey, fellas!
[16:03.390 --> 16:03.850]  Fellas!
[16:04.930 --> 16:05.990]  Fellas, stop it!
[16:06.030 --> 16:06.630]  Hands up!
[16:11.780 --> 16:13.240]  There's a little cutscene playing.
[16:14.180 --> 16:15.540]  He's just yelling in my ear.
[16:15.880 --> 16:17.600]  Yeah, I'm not listening to him.
[16:17.700 --> 16:18.260]  Much like Lester.
[16:21.300 --> 16:22.380]  Oh, there's Lester.
[16:23.100 --> 16:24.200]  Are we gonna off this guy?
[16:25.140 --> 16:26.360]  Sounds like you have a choice.
[16:29.240 --> 16:30.600]  I think Lester's coming.
[16:32.020 --> 16:33.020]  Oh no, stop him!
[16:33.520 --> 16:34.680]  Eric said he'd stop everyone.
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.480]  They're just making us watch a cutscene.
[16:38.600 --> 16:41.200]  I mean, we're essentially in a playable cutscene.
[16:41.900 --> 16:45.540]  If every loading screen was just this as a minigame, I would love to load.
[16:46.300 --> 16:47.360]  I could load all day.
[16:52.630 --> 16:53.830]  We're getting called losers.
[16:54.090 --> 16:56.450]  Yeah, the robot's calling us stupid little bitches.
[16:57.010 --> 16:57.410]  What?
[16:58.030 --> 16:58.430]  Yeah.
[16:58.510 --> 17:00.730]  Yeah, he was like, your thing's gonna self-destruct in 30 seconds.
[17:00.730 --> 17:02.390]  Yeah, he's saying that right now.
[17:02.670 --> 17:03.710]  Oh, my max health went up. Sweet.
[17:04.610 --> 17:06.930]  We can go up the hatch right here.
[17:07.930 --> 17:10.150]  He said secret escape via the torpedo hole.
[17:10.830 --> 17:11.090]  Yep.
[17:11.230 --> 17:13.290]  Alright, boys.
[17:13.570 --> 17:14.450]  The torpedo hole?
[17:16.430 --> 17:16.810]  Thanks, Nick.
[17:17.530 --> 17:17.970]  I got you.
[17:18.410 --> 17:18.990]  I'm out!
[17:19.990 --> 17:21.370]  Get into the Avenger.
[17:21.690 --> 17:23.970]  Okay, we gotta go to the Avenger? Are we going to you?
[17:23.970 --> 17:24.330]  Nope.
[17:24.830 --> 17:25.970]  Oh, shit. Can we...
[17:27.030 --> 17:28.430]  Nick, you gotta...
[17:28.430 --> 17:29.770]  Yeah, I'm gonna go fly the plane.
[17:30.010 --> 17:30.950]  Get to the shore, baby.
[17:32.310 --> 17:36.250]  Do we get to see the sub blow up? Why can't I swim and look the other way?
[17:36.370 --> 17:36.850]  Yeah, me neither.
[17:37.530 --> 17:38.390]  Oh, yeah, it's blowing up.
[17:38.410 --> 17:39.030]  Wow, cool!
[17:39.170 --> 17:39.830]  That's so cool.
[17:40.150 --> 17:43.050]  Alright, I gotta turn off autopilot.
[17:43.670 --> 17:44.470]  Alright, let's go.
[17:46.490 --> 17:47.570]  Whoa, we're on our way!
[17:47.790 --> 17:49.330]  We're just helicopters flying. That's pretty cool.
[17:50.630 --> 17:51.870]  I guess I'll meet you at the shore?
[17:52.370 --> 17:53.270]  Yeah, yeah, meet us at the shore.
[17:54.270 --> 17:54.670]  Okay.
[17:54.850 --> 17:58.090]  We're not doing a mid-ocean pickup at this point.
[17:59.150 --> 18:00.370]  Well, now that you mention it...
[18:00.370 --> 18:00.750]  No, I'm not doing that.
[18:00.750 --> 18:02.190]  I don't want to watch the cutscene again!
[18:02.210 --> 18:03.170]  Yeah, I had the same thought.
[18:05.890 --> 18:06.470]  Uh-oh!
[18:07.930 --> 18:13.310]  Yeah, why did you go to that part instead of just anywhere on the shore?
[18:13.930 --> 18:14.650]  This is the shore.
[18:15.450 --> 18:17.210]  What about the shore that Eric's going to?
[18:17.690 --> 18:18.750]  Where's Eric going to?
[18:19.730 --> 18:23.450]  I'm going to where the shore is, where the...
[18:23.450 --> 18:25.210]  I can see the fucking helicopter.
[18:26.130 --> 18:26.810]  All clear.
[18:27.390 --> 18:28.450]  Alright, so here...
[18:29.870 --> 18:31.090]  Where would you like your pickup?
[18:33.370 --> 18:35.090]  Uh, it seems like they're headed our way.
[18:35.330 --> 18:35.590]  Okay.
[18:36.450 --> 18:38.690]  It doesn't show us any particular beach.
[18:38.710 --> 18:39.570]  We're coming, we're coming.
[18:40.090 --> 18:40.350]  Okay.
[18:41.030 --> 18:42.510]  I'm swimming straight for you.
[18:43.590 --> 18:45.010]  That was a wild move not to take the boat.
[18:45.810 --> 18:46.570]  There was a boat?
[18:48.610 --> 18:50.030]  I didn't see the boat!
[18:50.570 --> 18:52.130]  You were, like, at the boat.
[18:52.130 --> 18:52.950]  I didn't see it!
[18:52.950 --> 18:54.210]  There's just women on it.
[18:54.530 --> 18:56.330]  Excuse me, women, can I borrow your boat?
[18:56.510 --> 18:57.890]  I didn't see the boat at all.
[18:58.270 --> 18:59.450]  Oh, I see it over there.
[19:00.970 --> 19:01.690]  Oh, yeah.
[19:02.330 --> 19:02.870]  There's a boat.
[19:04.310 --> 19:06.290]  Please don't hit the Avenger with that.
[19:06.470 --> 19:06.730]  You know what?
[19:08.290 --> 19:09.130]  Just for safety.
[19:10.390 --> 19:11.510]  Oh, I'm back underwater, cool.
[19:11.870 --> 19:12.890]  I've seen this minion before.
[19:14.170 --> 19:14.490]  Hello!
[19:15.150 --> 19:16.090]  Why not pick him up?
[19:17.130 --> 19:18.250]  He didn't want to get in the boat.
[19:18.670 --> 19:21.290]  He didn't say anything about me wanting to get in the boat.
[19:21.290 --> 19:22.530]  He just ran me over and went.
[19:22.750 --> 19:24.770]  I didn't have a chance, I don't know.
[19:24.850 --> 19:26.350]  He just ran me over and went.
[19:26.410 --> 19:26.970]  Yeah, I don't know.
[19:27.070 --> 19:28.930]  I didn't have a chance to get in the boat.
[19:29.050 --> 19:30.350]  No one asked me if I wanted to get in the boat.
[19:30.770 --> 19:31.790]  It's quite a long swim.
[19:31.890 --> 19:36.770]  I'll just make it a little bit more cinematic with some, like, torpedoes kind of explosions.
[19:38.630 --> 19:39.130]  How's it looking?
[19:39.410 --> 19:39.990]  Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
[19:40.190 --> 19:40.830]  Looking good.
[19:41.750 --> 19:42.750]  That one almost hit me in the head.
[19:44.230 --> 19:45.030]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[19:45.290 --> 19:45.510]  Okay.
[19:45.790 --> 19:46.730]  Everybody in the Avenger!
[19:49.970 --> 19:50.870]  Wait, we all in?
[19:51.290 --> 19:52.290]  Yeah, it's initializing.
[19:52.930 --> 19:53.730]  We are inside now.
[19:54.730 --> 19:55.070]  Ooh.
[19:55.650 --> 19:57.470]  Help deliver the Avenger to the drop-off.
[19:58.870 --> 19:59.850]  Ooh, we got people.
[20:00.390 --> 20:01.150]  I'm gonna sit down.
[20:01.910 --> 20:03.110]  Is everyone playing Game Boy in that?
[20:04.870 --> 20:06.250]  Let's fire everything!
[20:08.850 --> 20:10.270]  I think I hit a bird.
[20:12.510 --> 20:14.290]  I swear to God, Nick, if you Sully this...
[20:15.310 --> 20:16.090]  What are you talking about?
[20:17.410 --> 20:18.970]  Oh, Sully, right, right, right, right.
[20:19.930 --> 20:20.870]  Alright, we're going low.
[20:22.510 --> 20:23.630]  I mean, we're...
[20:24.290 --> 20:24.510]  Whatever.
[20:25.270 --> 20:27.870]  Things you don't want to hear your pilot say for 700.
[20:28.170 --> 20:28.890]  Yeah, no kidding.
[20:29.390 --> 20:30.810]  Nick, see if you can do a little wheel scrape.
[20:31.830 --> 20:32.270]  No!
[20:32.750 --> 20:33.470]  Ignore him.
[20:33.710 --> 20:34.590]  You can just touch the tip.
[20:35.670 --> 20:37.070]  I've got a great shot at the wheels.
[20:37.650 --> 20:39.610]  Oh, it's cool!
[20:42.750 --> 20:44.310]  You fucking dorks.
[20:44.870 --> 20:45.190]  What?
[20:46.850 --> 20:48.230]  Him hitting the wheel, and you're going,
[20:48.390 --> 20:48.870]  Cool!
[20:49.530 --> 20:50.350]  It was cool.
[20:51.530 --> 20:52.490]  Did it look cool?
[20:52.930 --> 20:53.030]  Sweet.
[20:53.270 --> 20:53.750]  Hold Y.
[20:54.250 --> 20:55.230]  Oh, you fucker.
[20:55.270 --> 20:55.730]  Yeah, I think we're good.
[20:55.970 --> 20:57.130]  You piece of shit.
[20:58.290 --> 20:59.790]  My brain shut down again.
[21:00.630 --> 21:01.750]  We're so close.
[21:02.770 --> 21:03.690]  Where is this?
[21:05.790 --> 21:07.010]  We're going back to the airport.
[21:07.390 --> 21:07.690]  Okay.
[21:08.990 --> 21:10.910]  Let's keep on heading straight down.
[21:12.210 --> 21:12.750]  Straight down?
[21:13.190 --> 21:14.470]  Well, you know what I mean.
[21:14.850 --> 21:16.570]  Don't. Yeah, don't. I wouldn't assume that.
[21:16.790 --> 21:16.970]  Within reason.
[21:18.810 --> 21:19.790]  Can this fly upside down?
[21:20.390 --> 21:20.830]  No.
[21:21.250 --> 21:22.110]  You don't think so?
[21:22.930 --> 21:23.870]  Unfortunately, it doesn't.
[21:25.430 --> 21:26.090]  Yeah, look.
[21:26.390 --> 21:26.750]  Oh, wow.
[21:26.950 --> 21:27.330]  Oh, okay.
[21:27.490 --> 21:31.870]  Well, I set it to the mode that doesn't hover.
[21:32.230 --> 21:32.790]  I see.
[21:34.170 --> 21:37.710]  I imagine if I tried that with the hover mode on, we'd be dead.
[21:39.090 --> 21:40.330]  So let's not do that.
[21:40.550 --> 21:40.810]  Okay.
[21:43.150 --> 21:45.070]  Oh, some people down there had a car crash.
[21:45.650 --> 21:46.330]  I wonder why.
[21:51.360 --> 21:52.680]  Oh, I shot it. It looks sick.
[21:53.760 --> 21:55.120]  Where does this have me land?
[21:56.040 --> 21:57.340]  Probably on the yellow dot.
[21:58.180 --> 21:59.720]  Yeah, but it's in the building.
[22:00.180 --> 22:04.460]  Yeah, you probably bring it down and then hover it down and then fly in.
[22:04.740 --> 22:05.000]  Okay.
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.760]  Gotta get into the Devon Weston.
[22:09.660 --> 22:10.580]  Think I can fly it in?
[22:11.480 --> 22:13.060]  Yeah, I think you should probably get lower, though.
[22:13.500 --> 22:13.780]  Okay.
[22:16.540 --> 22:17.580]  Alright, that scared me.
[22:19.280 --> 22:20.900]  Oh, I'm scared, too.
[22:21.280 --> 22:21.500]  Why?
[22:22.180 --> 22:23.180]  Is it saying up?
[22:24.340 --> 22:24.720]  No.
[22:25.320 --> 22:26.200]  No, you're good.
[22:26.960 --> 22:27.780]  Not saying that.
[22:28.300 --> 22:30.000]  It is indicating up, but I think...
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.180]  Yeah, it's fine. I mean, it's...
[22:31.180 --> 22:32.500]  It indicated down for me.
[22:36.500 --> 22:38.720]  Wait for my team to get into the Avenger.
[22:39.340 --> 22:40.520]  We're all in the Avenger.
[22:41.780 --> 22:42.660]  Who got out?
[22:43.440 --> 22:44.080]  Nobody's out.
[22:45.300 --> 22:46.740]  Hang on, let me count.
[22:46.740 --> 22:47.920]  I see me.
[22:48.380 --> 22:49.680]  I see Andrew.
[22:51.260 --> 22:52.320]  Nick is somewhere.
[22:53.300 --> 22:57.600]  Now I'm trying to think where a quiet person is when there's only four of us would be.
[22:58.360 --> 22:59.000]  Oh, there he is.
[22:59.120 --> 22:59.820]  Oh, he did it.
[23:00.140 --> 23:01.600]  Oh, so he was out of the Avenger.
[23:02.120 --> 23:03.380]  When did you hop out?
[23:03.840 --> 23:08.660]  No, I didn't get out. I went to the cockpit and then it trapped me in a loading screen for about a minute.
[23:09.100 --> 23:09.880]  Oh, my God.
[23:10.420 --> 23:12.440]  And then it just pushed me back out of the cockpit.
[23:13.880 --> 23:15.660]  Wait, so did we do it or what?
[23:15.660 --> 23:16.060]  Yeah!
[23:17.000 --> 23:17.560]  Oh, great.
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.600]  I mean, we helped bad things happen, but you know.
[23:21.220 --> 23:24.020]  Did we beat the heist?
[23:24.480 --> 23:25.200]  Yeah, we beat that one.
[23:25.320 --> 23:26.020]  That was part two.
[23:26.180 --> 23:27.020]  Part two of three.
[23:27.620 --> 23:28.000]  Wow.
[23:28.140 --> 23:30.320]  We should probably do another set up, though, because that was like 20 minutes.
[23:30.960 --> 23:31.140]  Yeah.
[23:32.020 --> 23:32.300]  Okay.
[23:32.460 --> 23:33.820]  That was insanely fast.
[23:34.300 --> 23:35.980]  Hell yeah, we rolled that time.
[23:36.780 --> 23:37.620]  I got almost $50,000.
[23:38.080 --> 23:39.040]  Got some job points.
[23:39.680 --> 23:40.940]  Dude, you got so many JPs.
[23:43.160 --> 23:43.900]  Job points.
[23:44.260 --> 23:44.740]  Did you get any RP?
[23:44.740 --> 23:45.400]  Hell yeah.
[23:47.380 --> 23:52.920]  What if Rockstar said, we'll give you a dollar for every JP you've made in this game?
[23:52.940 --> 23:53.940]  Holy shit.
[23:54.460 --> 23:55.620]  That'd be awesome.
[23:58.180 --> 24:01.220]  Typically, in your hypotheticals, there's a positive and a negative side to it.
[24:01.220 --> 24:01.380]  Yeah.
[24:01.600 --> 24:02.060]  That's great.
[24:04.140 --> 24:04.960]  So now what?
[24:06.360 --> 24:07.320]  I'm gonna...
[24:07.320 --> 24:08.080]  Where's my personal view?
[24:08.140 --> 24:13.340]  Oh, this isn't the one I wanted.
[24:14.380 --> 24:15.720]  This was the bullet car.
[24:16.540 --> 24:17.160]  Oh, cool.
[24:17.260 --> 24:18.740]  This is my personal vehicle, I guess.
[24:18.900 --> 24:19.260]  Oh.
[24:19.300 --> 24:19.860]  It's amazing.
[24:20.640 --> 24:21.380]  You want it?
[24:21.980 --> 24:22.900]  I guess I'll take it.
[24:23.100 --> 24:23.620]  I mean...
[24:23.620 --> 24:24.800]  Here, I'll let you take it.
[24:24.880 --> 24:28.020]  I'm just gonna take it to get a helicopter to fly back to the bunker.
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.800]  Gavin can order a helicopter right now.
[24:29.840 --> 24:31.040]  Why don't you just summon a helicopter?
[24:31.860 --> 24:32.260]  What?
[24:32.780 --> 24:34.220]  We're at the airport.
[24:37.600 --> 24:40.340]  Do we have to go anywhere right now, or are we just...
[24:40.340 --> 24:40.920]  Hey, look at this.
[24:41.160 --> 24:42.360]  The helicopter just appeared.
[24:42.360 --> 24:43.820]  I'm in a helicopter.
[24:44.160 --> 24:45.480]  Wow, cool, a helicopter.
[24:47.300 --> 24:48.420]  I drove to it.
[24:48.660 --> 24:49.400]  We walked to it.
[24:49.620 --> 24:50.280]  Then it appeared.
[24:51.480 --> 24:54.080]  This is making me go so slow to get into this thing.
[24:54.340 --> 24:54.780]  There we go.
[24:55.440 --> 24:56.480]  Alright, where to, boys?
[24:57.000 --> 24:57.660]  To the bunker.
[24:58.500 --> 24:59.900]  Let's take out the other helicopter.
[25:00.300 --> 25:00.480]  Okay.
[25:01.380 --> 25:01.860]  No.
[25:02.440 --> 25:03.100]  Look at me go.
[25:03.420 --> 25:03.840]  Get it.
[25:04.160 --> 25:04.920]  You can't get me.
[25:05.540 --> 25:06.240]  Can't catch me.
[25:07.720 --> 25:09.940]  I put on my speedy propellers today.
[25:10.100 --> 25:10.760]  With the pumps.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.540]  Hold on, let's just get some speed.
[25:13.540 --> 25:14.080]  We polished them last night.
[25:16.140 --> 25:16.740]  Oh, yeah.
[25:16.860 --> 25:17.520]  There we go.
[25:18.020 --> 25:18.440]  That's it.
[25:18.820 --> 25:19.480]  Can't catch me.
[25:20.620 --> 25:21.220]  Not yet.
[25:21.280 --> 25:22.180]  Oh, can't catch me.
[25:25.700 --> 25:27.180]  We just need one lucky one.
[25:27.360 --> 25:28.060]  You're going too slow.
[25:29.500 --> 25:30.640]  That's alright, we just have to have height.
[25:31.720 --> 25:32.460]  Oh, you went right.
[25:32.600 --> 25:33.340]  Interesting decision.
[25:36.700 --> 25:37.760]  Oh, he's going left.
[25:38.040 --> 25:40.120]  Oh, the chase continues.
[25:40.120 --> 25:41.540]  Going a little zig-zag.
[25:41.700 --> 25:42.400]  A little zig-zag.
[25:44.260 --> 25:44.820]  Oh, boy.
[25:44.880 --> 25:45.740]  I thought we were going right into that building.
[25:47.740 --> 25:48.520]  Now's your chance, Nick.
[25:48.660 --> 25:49.540]  Yup, yup, yup, yup.
[25:50.100 --> 25:50.440]  Aim it out.
[25:52.820 --> 25:54.020]  You gotta lead a little bit.
[25:54.820 --> 25:55.180]  Yeah, I know.
[25:56.020 --> 26:01.360]  Oh, that one was real pretty.
[26:01.520 --> 26:02.140]  Oh, dodging.
[26:02.320 --> 26:02.820]  I'm dodging.
[26:03.600 --> 26:04.160]  Okay, here we go.
[26:04.820 --> 26:05.780]  Help me, Chinese leader.
[26:12.650 --> 26:14.230]  Oh, that sounded really close.
[26:15.410 --> 26:17.010]  It's funny you should have mentioned that.
[26:22.720 --> 26:24.700]  Oh, it went over me.
[26:33.620 --> 26:35.440]  Attack it, Vinewood sign.
[26:35.540 --> 26:36.440]  Attack them.
[26:38.040 --> 26:39.040]  Gotta go higher.
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.780]  The O can't save you now.
[26:45.640 --> 26:47.220]  I gotta be close to the bunker.
[26:48.860 --> 26:49.420]  Almost home.
[26:50.140 --> 26:51.480]  Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[26:52.280 --> 26:52.840]  Alright, fellas.
[26:53.400 --> 26:53.680]  Unload.
[26:56.360 --> 26:57.080]  Oh, I see it.
[26:58.020 --> 26:59.000]  It's on my mini-map.
[27:01.860 --> 27:02.420]  Emergency landing.
[27:05.220 --> 27:05.780]  Emergency landing.
[27:07.120 --> 27:10.620]  Where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he, where is he?
[27:10.800 --> 27:11.560]  I can't see anything.
[27:17.200 --> 27:18.200]  Funky as shit.
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.400]  What the hell?
[27:19.720 --> 27:20.140]  I'm getting in!
[27:20.560 --> 27:21.940]  You couldn't catch me!
[27:22.860 --> 27:24.080]  The rat jumped out.
[27:24.280 --> 27:24.700]  You saved it.
[27:28.080 --> 27:30.040]  Hey, wait, you both jumped out?
[27:31.480 --> 27:32.020]  Big time.
[27:35.720 --> 27:36.820]  I'm gonna enter alone, actually.
[27:37.340 --> 27:39.060]  I got mowed down.
[27:39.620 --> 27:42.000]  Yeah, boy!
[27:43.340 --> 27:45.460]  Oh, I missed ya!
[27:45.460 --> 27:47.620]  What is that?
[27:48.260 --> 27:48.700]  Snowballs.
[27:50.380 --> 27:51.620]  Yeah, we have snow.
[27:51.820 --> 27:52.460]  You don't have snow still?
[27:53.020 --> 27:53.160]  What?
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.940]  I've been freed from my snowish prison.
[28:00.060 --> 28:02.040]  Oh, there it goes.
[28:02.580 --> 28:03.200]  We got it.
[28:05.020 --> 28:06.020]  Is that real fire?
[28:06.200 --> 28:07.240]  I don't know, I can't tell.
[28:09.780 --> 28:11.140]  I don't know what's going on.
[28:11.780 --> 28:12.220]  I don't either.
[28:12.400 --> 28:12.940]  That's crazy.
[28:13.080 --> 28:13.760]  It's far too crooked.
[28:13.760 --> 28:15.260]  Oh, no.
[28:16.180 --> 28:16.860]  No!
[28:22.080 --> 28:23.740]  There we go.
[28:24.380 --> 28:24.940]  No!
[28:26.220 --> 28:26.620]  Burn!
[28:26.820 --> 28:27.200]  Stop!
[28:27.440 --> 28:28.500]  You set Nick on fire.
[28:29.120 --> 28:29.660]  Not me.
[28:30.780 --> 28:31.560]  Oh, I got him!
[28:32.860 --> 28:33.740]  That's Gavin.
[28:34.420 --> 28:34.880]  Here we go.
[28:35.240 --> 28:35.480]  Prep.
[28:36.500 --> 28:36.960]  Prep.
[28:37.220 --> 28:37.460]  Prep.
[28:37.740 --> 28:37.960]  Prep.
[28:39.340 --> 28:40.440]  Mark cash.
[28:41.320 --> 28:41.700]  Okay.
[28:44.920 --> 28:46.740]  Alright, should we spawn a chopper?
[28:46.980 --> 28:47.080]  Yeah.
[28:47.500 --> 28:48.020]  Go ahead.
[28:48.120 --> 28:48.980]  I bet we have to wait.
[28:50.200 --> 28:50.560]  Yep.
[28:55.860 --> 28:57.080]  What happened to Andrew's?
[28:59.660 --> 29:00.880]  What happened to Andrew's?
[29:01.300 --> 29:02.140]  What happened to mine?
[29:02.700 --> 29:03.720]  There's cars over here, fellas!
[29:08.000 --> 29:08.840]  Andrew, what happened to yours?
[29:09.760 --> 29:10.540]  I don't know.
[29:11.780 --> 29:13.740]  I mean, did you fly it in or did you jump out of it?
[29:13.760 --> 29:14.560]  No, I parked it.
[29:14.560 --> 29:15.820]  It was perfectly parked.
[29:19.480 --> 29:21.200]  Ryan, does anyone have a four-seater?
[29:22.780 --> 29:23.780]  Uh, yeah.
[29:23.980 --> 29:24.280]  About to.
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.080]  On my way.
[29:29.460 --> 29:33.000]  Well, looks like Gavin got one.
[29:34.300 --> 29:35.280]  Hop in, fellas.
[29:35.520 --> 29:35.780]  Alright.
[29:36.340 --> 29:37.240]  Oh, it looks like a good one, too.
[29:39.120 --> 29:39.760]  On my way.
[29:40.220 --> 29:40.640]  Where'd he go, Nick?
[29:40.680 --> 29:41.220]  Oh, shit.
[29:42.200 --> 29:43.040]  I just made the cut.
[29:45.960 --> 29:47.120]  Oh, that person's mad.
[29:47.780 --> 29:48.180]  Alright.
[29:48.760 --> 29:49.460]  Right in the front.
[29:49.540 --> 29:49.740]  Let go.
[29:51.840 --> 29:52.240]  Hey.
[29:53.240 --> 29:53.640]  Hey!
[29:54.040 --> 29:54.520]  Hey, what?
[29:55.240 --> 29:56.860]  This is why we got a four-seater, Nick!
[29:57.300 --> 29:58.040]  Okay, I'll follow.
[29:59.960 --> 30:00.640]  Alright, let's go.
[30:01.300 --> 30:02.880]  We need, uh, you know, two viewpoints.
[30:08.940 --> 30:09.340]  No!
[30:09.760 --> 30:10.840]  No, that's the wrong thing.
[30:10.840 --> 30:11.300]  Don't do it!
[30:12.360 --> 30:13.080]  Don't do it!
[30:15.500 --> 30:16.020]  Nope.
[30:18.020 --> 30:18.640]  Is that a snowball?
[30:18.840 --> 30:19.600]  Kill it!
[30:22.980 --> 30:23.640]  Got him!
[30:23.800 --> 30:24.320]  Got it!
[30:33.460 --> 30:36.680]  Are you glad we had two POVs for that, Nick, or what?
[30:38.180 --> 30:39.580]  I didn't save it.
[30:39.920 --> 30:41.760]  Do you want a lift?
[30:43.680 --> 30:44.760]  Uh, yeah, I'd love a look.
[30:45.280 --> 30:46.960]  Oh, a lift or a look?
[30:47.500 --> 30:48.140]  Wait, what?
[30:48.420 --> 30:49.720]  So what is a look?
[30:50.460 --> 30:52.000]  I thought you wanted me to see the footage.
[30:53.740 --> 30:54.940]  We're still making it!
[30:57.280 --> 30:59.840]  I've seen you do stuff with stuff before.
[31:03.720 --> 31:05.540]  I've seen you do stuff with stuff, Gavin.
[31:05.780 --> 31:06.620]  Yeah, stuff with stuff.
[31:07.260 --> 31:07.620]  Ooh, money.
[31:08.840 --> 31:12.640]  I'm gonna start a new app, where you can request looks.
[31:14.520 --> 31:16.100]  I got one!
[31:17.200 --> 31:18.320]  Nope, I'm getting in.
[31:18.820 --> 31:20.000]  Oh, sorry!
[31:23.420 --> 31:24.200]  Hold on!
[31:24.880 --> 31:25.720]  Can you sit in the bed?
[31:25.960 --> 31:26.280]  I'm trying!
[31:27.060 --> 31:27.520]  Get in!
[31:27.920 --> 31:28.480]  Hold on!
[31:30.200 --> 31:32.680]  Alright, I'm in the back, let me try to sit.
[31:33.660 --> 31:34.460]  Okay, he got out.
[31:35.020 --> 31:35.220]  Okay.
[31:35.840 --> 31:36.260]  Alright.
[31:36.260 --> 31:37.120]  Oh, sorry.
[31:37.300 --> 31:37.860]  Give him a minute.
[31:38.020 --> 31:39.060]  Give him a look!
[31:41.620 --> 31:42.460]  Your look has arrived.
[31:43.180 --> 31:44.200]  Have a look!
[31:44.560 --> 31:48.460]  Like he was gonna take that footage and instantly send it to me on his phone or something, I don't know.
[31:51.880 --> 31:54.620]  He's shared clips after the heist before.
[31:55.660 --> 31:56.640]  What about during?
[31:57.440 --> 31:58.560]  Not while we're in it.
[31:58.640 --> 31:59.840]  He's setting the first.
[32:00.820 --> 32:01.660]  Yeah, listen.
[32:02.560 --> 32:03.740]  We're just getting really micro.
[32:04.160 --> 32:04.520]  It's cool.
[32:06.380 --> 32:08.160]  You know, like, here you go.
[32:08.260 --> 32:08.920]  We did that.
[32:08.980 --> 32:09.840]  Now look at it again.
[32:10.360 --> 32:10.960]  Pretty cool.
[32:14.120 --> 32:15.120]  Why'd you hit your desk?
[32:17.960 --> 32:19.420]  I just don't.
[32:21.100 --> 32:23.880]  If I pop this tear gas right now, will we all cry?
[32:24.360 --> 32:30.380]  You keep saying I don't know, then explaining the situation, and then saying I don't know, and then saying listen.
[32:30.740 --> 32:31.400]  It's a hypothetical.
[32:37.180 --> 32:38.300]  You know, a hypothetical.
[32:38.500 --> 32:39.580]  So sometimes you come up with answers.
[32:43.600 --> 32:44.460]  Grenades out, boys.
[32:53.860 --> 32:55.440]  You sure you don't want me in the other car?
[32:58.340 --> 33:00.040]  Should we all throw a grenade at the same time?
[33:00.320 --> 33:00.820]  Yep, I'm ready.
[33:02.060 --> 33:02.780]  On three.
[33:03.400 --> 33:03.620]  Okay.
[33:04.280 --> 33:04.640]  One.
[33:05.280 --> 33:05.520]  Two.
[33:06.600 --> 33:07.220]  Alright, I'm ready.
[33:07.760 --> 33:08.160]  One.
[33:08.500 --> 33:08.640]  Two.
[33:08.800 --> 33:09.040]  Three.
[33:09.180 --> 33:09.360]  Throw!
[33:10.800 --> 33:11.960]  I didn't expect it to throw.
[33:12.060 --> 33:12.640]  I thought it was on three.
[33:14.980 --> 33:15.720]  Should we cook them?
[33:17.340 --> 33:17.860]  Okay, ready?
[33:17.940 --> 33:18.380]  Look at mine.
[33:18.520 --> 33:19.520]  Oh my god!
[33:20.240 --> 33:23.560]  Oh, I died.
[33:24.740 --> 33:25.940]  Yeah, Gavin died.
[33:27.120 --> 33:28.100]  Yeah, yeah, just Gavin.
[33:28.640 --> 33:29.700]  Not everybody else.
[33:29.920 --> 33:31.140]  Yeah, it's about to happen again.
[33:32.560 --> 33:32.960]  Why?
[33:33.260 --> 33:35.320]  I just want to get to the strawberry station.
[33:35.560 --> 33:36.320]  Dude, no kidding.
[33:37.540 --> 33:39.060]  Maybe there's a car down here.
[33:39.280 --> 33:40.540]  That's what I just did.
[33:40.960 --> 33:41.360]  Gavin!
[33:43.800 --> 33:46.520]  Hey, was there a car down there?
[33:47.040 --> 33:47.520]  There's a couple.
[33:48.500 --> 33:49.920]  There's also a burnt up one.
[33:51.900 --> 33:52.680]  Oh god!
[33:55.740 --> 33:57.440]  Ooh, that's a way better car.
[33:58.800 --> 34:01.060]  That's like the car from Bad Boys 2.
[34:01.320 --> 34:01.840]  Let me in that.
[34:03.400 --> 34:03.900]  Which one?
[34:04.140 --> 34:04.540]  Yours.
[34:05.200 --> 34:06.460]  Oh yeah, the Hummer.
[34:06.460 --> 34:07.700]  The Hummer at the end of Bad Boys.
[34:09.000 --> 34:09.740]  Oh, fuck.
[34:09.920 --> 34:10.920]  I just need to buy this.
[34:11.480 --> 34:12.120]  In the pink shirt.
[34:13.800 --> 34:14.600]  Oh shit.
[34:14.800 --> 34:15.520]  Oh my god.
[34:15.660 --> 34:16.580]  Oh, he didn't make it.
[34:18.680 --> 34:20.160]  I think he already hadn't made it.
[34:20.400 --> 34:22.560]  Well, if he had, he definitely didn't after that.
[34:24.440 --> 34:25.660]  Press Y to open image.
[34:29.580 --> 34:30.120]  Where's Eric?
[34:31.080 --> 34:32.020]  I'm driving over.
[34:34.520 --> 34:35.440]  Got a car.
[34:35.660 --> 34:36.220]  Heading over.
[34:36.900 --> 34:38.060]  Right behind you guys.
[34:39.460 --> 34:40.180]  I mean, you're behind those guys.
[34:40.220 --> 34:40.380]  Oh shit.
[34:40.600 --> 34:41.160]  Get the duffel.
[34:43.600 --> 34:44.460]  Is it under the bridge?
[34:45.560 --> 34:46.920]  Yeah, I think it's got to be.
[34:47.000 --> 34:47.260]  Looks like it.
[34:47.280 --> 34:47.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:47.820 --> 34:48.180]  I see it.
[34:48.600 --> 34:49.220]  Let's go!
[34:50.820 --> 34:51.360]  I see it.
[34:55.910 --> 34:56.370]  Got it.
[34:58.290 --> 34:58.610]  Ow!
[34:59.370 --> 35:00.150]  Get in, guys!
[35:00.350 --> 35:01.290]  Let me in, let me in, let me in!
[35:02.590 --> 35:03.290]  Alright, let's go!
[35:03.670 --> 35:04.430]  I'm calling you!
[35:04.430 --> 35:04.810]  I'm calling you, Lester!
[35:04.950 --> 35:05.750]  You get him off us!
[35:05.770 --> 35:06.450]  Oh, my car!
[35:06.670 --> 35:07.090]  I stole!
[35:11.450 --> 35:12.950]  Oh, it's a public session, is this?
[35:14.130 --> 35:14.290]  Huh?
[35:14.450 --> 35:16.330]  Yeah, but it's only us in it, I think.
[35:16.570 --> 35:17.030]  Oh, okay.
[35:17.910 --> 35:18.170]  There we go.
[35:19.070 --> 35:19.570]  It's a private public session.
[35:19.570 --> 35:20.490]  Oh, did you just call Lester?
[35:20.950 --> 35:21.170]  Yeah.
[35:21.270 --> 35:21.410]  What?
[35:21.530 --> 35:21.930]  Hell yeah!
[35:22.650 --> 35:23.610]  Okay, so you've...
[35:23.610 --> 35:24.590]  I can't believe that worked.
[35:24.950 --> 35:25.810]  I can't either.
[35:25.950 --> 35:26.450]  What happened?
[35:27.390 --> 35:28.470]  Gavin's trying to go off the road.
[35:28.930 --> 35:29.570]  I was trying to get to...
[35:29.570 --> 35:32.130]  because the line was down there, but I came up here.
[35:32.790 --> 35:33.430]  There's a...
[35:33.430 --> 35:34.070]  Oh, man.
[35:35.090 --> 35:35.450]  Well...
[35:35.810 --> 35:37.270]  Okay, I put a new marker down for you.
[35:39.130 --> 35:39.490]  Yep.
[35:39.990 --> 35:40.290]  Okay.
[35:40.510 --> 35:41.110]  Yep, go right.
[35:41.450 --> 35:42.050]  Go to the...
[35:42.050 --> 35:42.590]  Oh, okay.
[35:42.750 --> 35:43.430]  Alright, go left.
[35:43.910 --> 35:44.790]  Let's try to get on the road, son.
[35:46.910 --> 35:47.270]  You're...
[35:47.270 --> 35:47.970]  Oh, it's the train track.
[35:48.610 --> 35:48.970]  You're...
[35:48.970 --> 35:50.470]  Man, what is going on?
[35:51.390 --> 35:52.110]  What happened?
[35:54.130 --> 35:54.890]  Oh, there's a sign.
[35:54.970 --> 35:55.710]  Oh, no!
[35:56.010 --> 35:56.590]  What did it say?
[35:56.970 --> 35:57.670]  I didn't see it.
[36:00.630 --> 36:02.170]  Oh, can I buy that car wash?
[36:02.170 --> 36:03.270]  Well, that's...
[36:03.270 --> 36:04.470]  Is that...
[36:04.470 --> 36:04.850]  What? Where?
[36:04.970 --> 36:07.090]  No, that's like the GTA Plus thing.
[36:08.570 --> 36:10.210]  Do you think we can go through the window?
[36:10.490 --> 36:11.170]  That's not a car wash.
[36:11.950 --> 36:13.370]  No, not the car wash of the...
[36:13.830 --> 36:14.830]  The car sales place?
[36:15.430 --> 36:15.790]  Yeah.
[36:16.050 --> 36:16.350]  The dealer?
[36:16.530 --> 36:17.070]  The place from the story.
[36:17.950 --> 36:19.410]  Because you do this in the mission, don't you?
[36:22.010 --> 36:22.370]  Nope.
[36:26.490 --> 36:27.210]  I don't...
[36:27.210 --> 36:27.990]  I don't...
[36:27.990 --> 36:29.450]  I don't...
[36:30.150 --> 36:31.170]  I just don't know.
[36:31.170 --> 36:32.110]  Get something!
[36:32.470 --> 36:34.190]  Not the bus, not the bus, not the bus!
[36:34.390 --> 36:34.810]  The bus is great.
[36:35.010 --> 36:35.670]  The bus is good.
[36:35.710 --> 36:36.630]  Oh, you're taking the bus.
[36:37.030 --> 36:37.690]  Bus squad.
[36:37.930 --> 36:39.130]  We're taking the bus.
[36:39.250 --> 36:41.630]  You cannot inspect these vehicles while on a mission.
[36:41.770 --> 36:43.110]  God damn it, I was gonna buy some.
[36:43.310 --> 36:43.850]  Let's go!
[36:44.710 --> 36:45.690]  Oh, the bus!
[36:45.890 --> 36:46.170]  One sec!
[36:46.430 --> 36:46.730]  Ah!
[36:47.190 --> 36:48.230]  Nick doesn't want on the bus.
[36:48.390 --> 36:49.270]  Alright, I'll get on the bus.
[36:49.550 --> 36:49.850]  Timmy really...
[36:49.850 --> 36:51.270]  Really upgraded his window.
[36:53.030 --> 36:53.350]  Thank you!
[36:53.750 --> 36:54.630]  Something happened to the guy over there.
[36:54.630 --> 36:54.870]  Alright, let's go.
[36:55.550 --> 36:56.950]  That'll be 65p, please.
[36:58.850 --> 36:59.250]  P?
[37:02.190 --> 37:02.670]  Oh...
[37:03.490 --> 37:04.450]  Jesus Christ.
[37:06.050 --> 37:08.690]  Hey Gavin, quid is like buck, right?
[37:09.290 --> 37:10.230]  Yeah, but for a pound.
[37:10.410 --> 37:10.850]  Right, okay.
[37:12.390 --> 37:13.670]  A pound is like stone?
[37:15.050 --> 37:16.270]  A pound is like dollar.
[37:17.510 --> 37:17.870]  What?
[37:18.430 --> 37:18.810]  What?
[37:20.090 --> 37:21.470]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[37:21.590 --> 37:22.770]  Yeah, that other pound.
[37:26.920 --> 37:27.880]  Oh dear.
[37:28.720 --> 37:29.120]  Oh dear.
[37:30.480 --> 37:35.380]  If you press Y, do you have to, like, get up from your seat and walk over to the door before you jump out?
[37:36.140 --> 37:36.560]  Oh god.
[37:36.780 --> 37:37.460]  Nope, just out the window!
[37:40.680 --> 37:42.240]  That was really cool from first person.
[37:42.400 --> 37:43.260]  Oh, this is my stop!
[37:46.840 --> 37:48.840]  So cool that you just go straight out the window.
[37:49.840 --> 37:52.060]  So it was just broken and I just flung myself out?
[37:52.700 --> 37:53.740]  Yeah, you just dived.
[37:54.700 --> 37:55.320]  I dived?
[37:57.220 --> 37:57.660]  Dove?
[37:58.360 --> 37:58.800]  Dove?
[37:59.160 --> 37:59.600]  Dave.
[37:59.940 --> 38:01.200]  I doved!
[38:01.980 --> 38:02.420]  Pound.
[38:06.360 --> 38:11.720]  If I was riding on a bus with a dude who had a rat mask on...
[38:12.180 --> 38:13.160]  I don't know what I'd do.
[38:14.560 --> 38:16.580]  Also, the snowman behind you is terrifying.
[38:16.760 --> 38:17.620]  That is a great story.
[38:19.220 --> 38:21.540]  Hey, this hypothetical that I'm laying out...
[38:21.540 --> 38:22.460]  I don't know where it's going.
[38:22.460 --> 38:29.520]  Which is crazy, because every time Nick gets a hypothetical, he's like, alright, let's investigate every avenue of this thing before giving an answer.
[38:29.660 --> 38:31.500]  This was, here's a hypothetical I'm setting up.
[38:31.620 --> 38:32.360]  I don't know.
[38:32.520 --> 38:34.360]  I'd jump out the window in first person.
[38:35.580 --> 38:39.100]  If you do it up here, do you just go straight over the edge?
[38:39.580 --> 38:40.940]  Let's find out.
[38:44.620 --> 38:49.420]  I don't even have an answer to that, because it looked like you were going to and then it snapped you to the outside of my screen.
[38:52.460 --> 38:52.920]  Get in, son.
[38:53.640 --> 38:55.180]  Yeah, get in the bus, Nick, come on.
[38:55.400 --> 38:56.980]  I'm in first person mode, this is hard to do.
[38:59.420 --> 39:02.320]  Do you think that there's a way in life to go in third person?
[39:02.360 --> 39:04.960]  I tried to get in the bus, the driver drove!
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.080]  They have a tendency of doing that.
[39:09.060 --> 39:09.520]  Doing what?
[39:09.900 --> 39:10.220]  Driving.
[39:10.380 --> 39:10.680]  Driving!
[39:11.760 --> 39:12.740]  Do you want me to try it again?
[39:13.560 --> 39:13.760]  No.
[39:13.920 --> 39:16.600]  No, I want to beat the mission.
[39:17.000 --> 39:17.320]  Why?
[39:19.920 --> 39:21.840]  Because you have to go, what do you mean why?
[39:21.840 --> 39:22.860]  It's 15 minutes!
[39:25.820 --> 39:26.180]  Insane.
[39:26.680 --> 39:28.500]  Hey Gavin, you know what would be the funniest thing in the world right now?
[39:29.560 --> 39:30.220]  You went up that hill.
[39:31.360 --> 39:31.880]  Which hill?
[39:32.060 --> 39:32.260]  This one?
[39:32.520 --> 39:32.760]  Yeah.
[39:33.120 --> 39:33.660]  Oh shit.
[39:34.040 --> 39:39.700]  I don't mean to break it to you negatively, Nick, I think you have a really low bar for what the funniest thing in the world might be.
[39:39.720 --> 39:41.040]  We're not in a plane, so.
[39:41.300 --> 39:42.680]  He just has no idea.
[39:43.520 --> 39:44.940]  I really didn't, I was at a loss.
[39:45.560 --> 39:46.560]  There you go, that's exciting.
[39:48.280 --> 39:49.700]  There's something wrong with this guy.
[39:50.320 --> 39:50.560]  Who?
[39:50.560 --> 39:51.420]  You!
[39:52.860 --> 39:53.380]  You?
[39:55.540 --> 39:57.040]  Are you talking to you?
[39:58.020 --> 39:59.640]  Tell me who are you?
[40:00.160 --> 40:01.200]  Who are you?
[40:02.600 --> 40:07.780]  Isn't it weird that CSI was so prominent and then just went away in like a 10 year stretch?
[40:08.140 --> 40:09.880]  I watched so much CSI in Mexico.
[40:10.220 --> 40:14.880]  There was a whole CSI thing in Mexico, Geoff couldn't get his TV to not be in Spanish.
[40:15.700 --> 40:17.020]  It was a whole thing.
[40:17.600 --> 40:18.300]  Andrew, press Y.
[40:19.380 --> 40:19.740]  No.
[40:19.740 --> 40:19.820]  Oh.
[40:21.440 --> 40:23.480]  I don't even have the controller in my hands.
[40:25.540 --> 40:26.320]  Nick, press Y.
[40:31.580 --> 40:32.760]  Alright, let's keep going.
[40:33.260 --> 40:35.520]  He'll get here, he'll find us eventually, let's go.
[40:37.400 --> 40:38.720]  That looks so good.
[40:39.160 --> 40:40.260]  That looks really good.
[40:41.460 --> 40:42.080]  I'll catch up.
[40:42.680 --> 40:43.380]  I'll come back to you.
[40:43.440 --> 40:45.220]  Actually, you can catch up in any vehicle.
[40:45.780 --> 40:46.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[40:46.600 --> 40:48.200]  I'm sure I could, on a bicycle even.
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.840]  Is this the slowest vehicle in the game, do you think?
[40:51.080 --> 40:51.380]  No.
[40:51.500 --> 40:53.060]  No, tractor probably.
[40:53.640 --> 40:54.900]  Oh yeah, could be the golf cart.
[40:55.780 --> 40:57.560]  Alright, can I jump onto the bus?
[41:00.740 --> 41:04.520]  I was reading about that Robbie Williams biopic that just came out, where he's the monkey.
[41:04.980 --> 41:05.280]  Yeah, I missed.
[41:05.480 --> 41:08.480]  I didn't realize that he didn't do any of the singing for that movie.
[41:09.760 --> 41:10.580]  What? What do you mean?
[41:10.720 --> 41:11.060]  He did one song.
[41:11.540 --> 41:16.160]  They brought in some other pop star to sing all of his music to redo it for the movie.
[41:16.780 --> 41:17.180]  What?
[41:17.860 --> 41:18.260]  Why?
[41:19.340 --> 41:24.560]  Because I guess he sounds too old now to be young Robbie Williams, and they wanted to do new tracks for it.
[41:24.660 --> 41:26.380]  Why didn't they just use his old recording?
[41:26.780 --> 41:29.300]  Because they wanted to update it, so they brought in a guy.
[41:30.640 --> 41:31.300]  That's insane.
[41:31.680 --> 41:32.260]  That's wild.
[41:32.900 --> 41:37.120]  These Led Zeppelin tracks sound old. Let's get some guys that sound like Led Zeppelin, kind of.
[41:37.640 --> 41:42.400]  What blew my mind about it is that, first of all, I never even considered that a possibility.
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.040]  So this other guy sings 90% of the songs. Robbie Williams sings one song in it.
[41:47.420 --> 41:51.300]  And then some other guy did all the motion capture for it and the speaking.
[41:51.920 --> 41:54.640]  So Robbie Williams did one song and then the movie was made?
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.200]  He did one song, and it's his life story, but he didn't do any of the performance work for it.
[41:59.420 --> 41:59.660]  Oh.
[42:00.780 --> 42:06.300]  Which I kind of respect as a biopic. It's the least amount of work you can put in while being involved in your own biopic.
[42:08.340 --> 42:09.300]  Pretty crazy.
[42:10.140 --> 42:11.060]  I haven't seen it yet.
[42:11.480 --> 42:17.620]  It's just the guy, that song, being like, I'm seeing all these celebrities talk about this movie and they have no idea they're listening to me.
[42:17.760 --> 42:18.780]  That's crazy.
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.160]  Yeah, I don't think it made any money in the U.S.
[42:21.180 --> 42:21.500]  No.
[42:22.500 --> 42:24.320]  Well, he wasn't really big in the U.S., was he?
[42:24.540 --> 42:25.360]  No, not at all.
[42:25.420 --> 42:25.720]  No.
[42:25.960 --> 42:30.020]  He was a VH1 guy. He was like, Rock DJ was like a VH1 song.
[42:31.160 --> 42:32.120]  Oh, his skin comes off.
[42:32.660 --> 42:32.940]  Yeah.
[42:33.060 --> 42:34.540]  And then they eat it. It's crazy.
[42:34.700 --> 42:35.340]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[42:36.580 --> 42:37.500]  He's a cheeky monkey.
[42:39.500 --> 42:39.860]  Okay.
[42:41.300 --> 42:44.540]  When the conversation's gone too weird for Nick, it makes me feel good.
[42:44.760 --> 42:44.940]  Yeah.
[42:47.700 --> 42:48.360]  What do you mean?
[42:49.300 --> 42:50.600]  Man, we are bouncing around.
[42:51.380 --> 42:52.340]  Hold Y to figure out meaning.
[42:57.060 --> 42:58.220]  Oh, what a sick exit!
[42:58.220 --> 42:58.860]  Doesn't even make sense!
[43:00.900 --> 43:02.220]  Andrew went to go find meaning.
[43:05.820 --> 43:06.840]  Oh my gosh, he's done it!
[43:06.840 --> 43:09.040]  For the rest of the heist videos going forward, I'm replaced by Geoff.
[43:13.280 --> 43:16.500]  Should we get different people to voice us in the replay clips?
[43:16.680 --> 43:18.100]  Oh, that'd be great.
[43:18.520 --> 43:19.540]  Oh, that'd be awesome.
[43:20.100 --> 43:20.800]  Fluke face style.
[43:21.580 --> 43:22.500]  Well, there goes the evidence.
[43:22.540 --> 43:24.360]  Maybe we can get Robbie Williams to play you.
[43:25.660 --> 43:26.700]  We did it!
[43:27.300 --> 43:30.620]  We did the prep mission, and we did a whole heist.
[43:31.220 --> 43:31.580]  Wow!
[43:31.800 --> 43:32.240]  What a time.
[43:32.860 --> 43:36.920]  Thank you so much for watching. We will be back. We're on the final Doomsday 1.
[43:37.720 --> 43:39.320]  Well, knock this prep out.
[43:39.520 --> 43:42.580]  If you want to check out our podcast, we're Regulation Pod.
[43:43.500 --> 43:45.520]  We have a Patreon, Regulation Pod.
[43:45.680 --> 43:47.100]  We do streams, we do all sorts of stuff.
[43:47.480 --> 43:49.320]  Mainly check out our Patreon. You'll find out a bunch of info there.
[43:49.740 --> 43:50.780]  Thank you so much for watching.
[43:51.240 --> 43:52.120]  Have a great rest of your day.
[43:52.420 --> 43:52.880]  See you next time!
[43:52.960 --> 43:53.200]  Bye!
[43:53.660 --> 43:55.060]  I'm getting eaten by a cougar!
[43:55.280 --> 43:56.380]  A cougar killed me!
[43:58.680 --> 43:59.540]  Where's the cougar?
[44:00.840 --> 44:01.740]  Let's get the coog.
[44:02.000 --> 44:02.640]  Where is it?
[44:03.260 --> 44:03.840]  I don't know.
[44:04.400 --> 44:05.760]  Where's my bot? I don't know.
[44:06.520 --> 44:08.020]  It fucking came out of nowhere.
[44:09.240 --> 44:10.660]  Did it go back to nowhere?
[44:10.860 --> 44:11.940]  There's no cougar around it.
[44:12.840 --> 44:14.000]  I was just trying to find meaning.
[44:14.380 --> 44:15.560]  He's making it up for attention.
[44:16.060 --> 44:17.380]  Oh, it's over here. It's over here. It's over here.
[44:18.460 --> 44:19.120]  Oh, what the?
[44:19.940 --> 44:20.800]  Let's get the cougar.
[44:21.060 --> 44:21.360]  Let's get it.
[44:21.360 --> 44:22.120]  That's how we end the video.
[44:22.240 --> 44:23.220]  That's how we end the video.
[44:23.940 --> 44:24.340]  Here it is.
[44:24.420 --> 44:25.920]  With fists. Fists. Cougar fists.
[44:26.560 --> 44:27.220]  Yeah, only fists.
[44:27.220 --> 44:28.300]  It doesn't accept money!
[44:28.780 --> 44:29.260]  Fists only.
[44:30.860 --> 44:32.140]  I punched it! No!
[44:33.480 --> 44:34.200]  Where is it?
[44:34.200 --> 44:35.360]  Where is it?
[44:35.420 --> 44:35.960]  Is it alive?
[44:36.260 --> 44:36.820]  Did you run it over?
[44:38.260 --> 44:39.640]  It might have gotten run over.
[44:39.740 --> 44:40.640]  I think it got run over.
[44:41.060 --> 44:42.080]  Oh, I think it definitely got run over.
[44:42.160 --> 44:42.600]  Oh, yeah.
[44:42.740 --> 44:42.880]  It's right here.
[44:42.880 --> 44:44.800]  Your bodyguards failed to protect you. Their wages have been cut.
[44:45.120 --> 44:45.760]  As they should have been.
[44:46.060 --> 44:46.360]  Ah!
[44:47.900 --> 44:48.220]  Alright.
[44:48.800 --> 44:48.940]  Anyway.
[44:49.060 --> 44:49.620]  See you next time. Bye!
[44:49.880 --> 44:50.200]  Bye!
[44:50.780 --> 44:51.400]  That's a lot of blood.
