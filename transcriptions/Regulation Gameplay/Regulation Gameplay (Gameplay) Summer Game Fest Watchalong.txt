[00:02.580 --> 00:04.380]  It's Summer Games Fest!
[00:04.600 --> 00:07.020]  Don't care what Eric says, we're going live.
[00:07.460 --> 00:07.840]  Wow!
[00:08.340 --> 00:09.740]  I'm a little guy.
[00:09.960 --> 00:14.760]  Guys, welcome to what has become an annual tradition,
[00:14.980 --> 00:19.040]  which means that you will demand it and we will get tired of doing it.
[00:19.120 --> 00:21.520]  It's Summer Games Fest and we're watching it live.
[00:21.680 --> 00:23.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:23.200 --> 00:23.260]  No, no, no.
[00:23.500 --> 00:24.120]  What? Huh?
[00:24.180 --> 00:25.540]  Eric, I made the same mistake.
[00:25.860 --> 00:29.380]  Summer Game Fest. We're watching one game for two hours.
[00:29.620 --> 00:30.880]  The next two hours...
[00:30.880 --> 00:32.820]  It is the Summer Game.
[00:32.860 --> 00:34.300]  What game do you think it is?
[00:34.920 --> 00:36.160]  Garfield Kart 2!
[00:36.540 --> 00:41.100]  No, they would never, Andrew, they would never make a Garfield Kart 2.
[00:41.280 --> 00:42.040]  There's no way.
[00:42.400 --> 00:43.500]  I've seen the Steam page.
[00:44.020 --> 00:44.640]  It's real!
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.080]  Speaking of kart, have you been playing any new Mario Kart?
[00:50.520 --> 00:51.020]  Not yet.
[00:51.560 --> 00:53.500]  I mean, you've never played a Mario Kart.
[00:53.740 --> 01:00.040]  I played the GameCube one a bit and I played a little bit on the N64, but I did not...
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.380]  I'm the one person that owned a Switch from existing and never bought Mario Kart 8.
[01:05.680 --> 01:06.520]  That's crazy.
[01:06.520 --> 01:06.840]  Wow.
[01:06.980 --> 01:07.540]  That is crazy.
[01:07.740 --> 01:08.480]  That's a fun game.
[01:08.520 --> 01:09.180]  That's what I hear.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.740]  New Mario Kart, pretty phenomenal.
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.060]  I hear it's no Garfield Kart.
[01:14.900 --> 01:20.820]  Yeah, well, so there's like a lot of unlockable characters in this one, but none of them are Odie or Nermal, so I don't really...
[01:20.820 --> 01:21.160]  What about...
[01:21.160 --> 01:21.520]  Oh, man.
[01:21.580 --> 01:23.640]  Is anybody from Crash Team Racing in it?
[01:23.640 --> 01:26.900]  I haven't seen them yet, if they are.
[01:27.160 --> 01:33.760]  It would be really special if people from Mario Brothers included some people from Crash Team Racing.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.720]  There's a Bandicoot, but not Crash Bandicoot. It's just generic Bandicoot.
[01:37.740 --> 01:40.180]  Anybody from Sonic All-Stars Racing in there?
[01:41.880 --> 01:50.800]  I heard that Sonic All-Star Racing or whatever 2 leaked and Spongebob Squarepants is in it.
[01:50.800 --> 01:51.220]  Wow!
[01:52.580 --> 01:55.400]  So everything you're saying is all within the realm of possibility.
[01:56.120 --> 01:57.240]  Oh, you're being serious?
[01:57.400 --> 01:57.720]  Yeah.
[01:58.360 --> 01:58.760]  Oh.
[01:59.140 --> 01:59.520]  Yeah.
[01:59.580 --> 02:00.320]  Fuck, okay.
[02:00.620 --> 02:00.780]  Yeah.
[02:01.540 --> 02:01.940]  Okay.
[02:02.360 --> 02:03.560]  I'm just giving you the news, baby.
[02:04.020 --> 02:04.820]  Ooh, yeah, you are.
[02:06.440 --> 02:06.840]  Unbiased.
[02:07.120 --> 02:07.560]  Are we testing right now?
[02:07.560 --> 02:09.640]  Oh, thanks for the sub recovery one.
[02:10.080 --> 02:10.500]  Thank you so much.
[02:10.500 --> 02:11.900]  They subscribed for eight months. Good lord.
[02:11.920 --> 02:12.260]  Holy shit.
[02:12.360 --> 02:12.960]  Oh, boys.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.460]  Also, I recognize your username.
[02:16.700 --> 02:18.440]  Hey, Santa, thanks for the five subs.
[02:18.640 --> 02:19.200]  Thanks, Santa.
[02:19.440 --> 02:20.140]  Thank you.
[02:20.140 --> 02:22.120]  You're in your season right now and you're still giving gifts.
[02:22.220 --> 02:22.980]  That's fucking amazing.
[02:23.980 --> 02:25.180]  Ooh, I like this.
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.340]  He's a real one.
[02:29.340 --> 02:30.540]  Like you, shiny Addy.
[02:30.960 --> 02:33.800]  The guy's the creator of the Game Awards.
[02:34.640 --> 02:36.100]  Yay, he's here.
[02:36.480 --> 02:38.620]  Look at him, he created... oh, why would you think...
[02:38.620 --> 02:40.500]  Here's the thing about wearing a suit.
[02:41.600 --> 02:42.500]  Go all the way.
[02:43.160 --> 02:44.860]  Wear the shoes that go with the suit.
[02:45.040 --> 02:46.740]  That looks awful.
[02:47.180 --> 02:48.120]  That looks awful.
[02:48.240 --> 02:48.840]  That's like abysmal.
[02:49.780 --> 02:50.880]  Oh, the shirt underneath.
[02:51.700 --> 02:52.140]  God.
[02:52.480 --> 02:54.980]  I was going to say I disagree and then I realized I don't care.
[02:55.480 --> 02:55.920]  Terrible.
[02:56.180 --> 02:57.260]  Love the way that dude spells his name.
[02:57.440 --> 02:58.080]  Absolute love.
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.200]  He is dressed in the most GDC-ass looking outfit, dude.
[03:04.420 --> 03:06.960]  That is... oh, is that a t-shirt underneath a sports coat?
[03:07.180 --> 03:08.560]  Yeah, GDC time.
[03:09.560 --> 03:12.860]  There must have been a time in the past when we interacted at some point,
[03:12.920 --> 03:16.980]  because I noticed that we're friends on Facebook last year when I had to log into Facebook or something.
[03:16.980 --> 03:17.660]  You and Geoff Keighley?
[03:17.680 --> 03:18.860]  I have no idea why.
[03:20.060 --> 03:21.000]  That's pretty cool.
[03:21.640 --> 03:23.280]  I assume it's a Geoff alliance.
[03:23.920 --> 03:25.860]  Could be. Could just be a Geoff club thing.
[03:26.000 --> 03:26.160]  Yeah.
[03:28.700 --> 03:30.060]  Schindler's Fist, another gifted sub.
[03:30.380 --> 03:30.540]  Wow.
[03:30.720 --> 03:31.160]  Thank you.
[03:31.680 --> 03:32.360]  Thank you.
[03:34.140 --> 03:36.800]  Also, best bet 24 with 25 gifted.
[03:37.100 --> 03:38.660]  I'm not going to spend the whole time calling these out.
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.640]  I just want to let you guys know.
[03:39.760 --> 03:40.240]  That's pretty incredible.
[03:40.580 --> 03:41.740]  Yeah, that is incredible.
[03:42.100 --> 03:43.540]  Do you guys hear about these dinosaurs?
[03:43.880 --> 03:44.780]  They're fucking crazy.
[03:45.320 --> 03:46.760]  Somebody said, are we going to 601 today?
[03:46.860 --> 03:48.280]  We're going the whole distance, baby.
[03:48.280 --> 03:49.080]  Thank you so much.
[03:49.080 --> 03:49.840]  Thanks, Keighley.
[03:50.880 --> 03:51.800]  All 13 of you.
[03:56.700 --> 03:58.320]  Yeah, repo!
[04:02.320 --> 04:04.000]  How many of these have we played?
[04:04.500 --> 04:05.780]  Schedule 1, we have not.
[04:05.960 --> 04:07.300]  Monster Hunter's right there, baby.
[04:08.740 --> 04:11.400]  Inzoys and Kingdom Come are the only ones we've ever played, I guess.
[04:11.740 --> 04:12.680]  And Civ, yeah.
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.420]  Oh, we played Monster Hunter.
[04:14.420 --> 04:15.700]  Have we played Schedule 1?
[04:16.620 --> 04:17.680]  No, I don't think so.
[04:17.680 --> 04:18.780]  Uh-uh.
[04:19.840 --> 04:20.960]  Did we play Oblivion?
[04:22.180 --> 04:23.300]  Not for content.
[04:23.660 --> 04:25.260]  Oh, you know, we haven't played that for content.
[04:25.620 --> 04:26.220]  That's a good point.
[04:27.840 --> 04:29.460]  Civ 7? Do we need another?
[04:30.640 --> 04:31.080]  Dude...
[04:31.740 --> 04:32.940]  I don't get it.
[04:33.380 --> 04:34.840]  I didn't like Civ 6.
[04:36.020 --> 04:37.140]  What about 1 through 5?
[04:37.860 --> 04:38.740]  I liked 4.
[04:40.300 --> 04:41.560]  I liked Civ Rev.
[04:41.680 --> 04:42.460]  That was my favorite Civ.
[04:44.120 --> 04:45.540]  I don't even know what that is.
[04:45.560 --> 04:45.980]  Is it good?
[04:46.820 --> 04:47.760]  What, Civ Rev?
[04:48.120 --> 04:48.360]  Yeah.
[04:49.640 --> 04:50.520]  Civilization Revolutions?
[04:50.780 --> 04:51.220]  Yeah.
[04:51.660 --> 04:52.540]  You never played that one?
[04:53.460 --> 04:55.080]  I've never played any Civilization game.
[04:55.380 --> 04:56.100]  Oh, okay.
[04:56.240 --> 04:58.900]  I'm not smart enough to play a Civilization game.
[04:59.240 --> 05:00.220]  Oh, you'd be surprised.
[05:00.520 --> 05:01.040]  It's a board game.
[05:01.320 --> 05:02.200]  Andrew can play it.
[05:02.200 --> 05:03.060]  I stand by what I said.
[05:10.140 --> 05:11.900]  Did you like Split Fiction, Andrew?
[05:12.680 --> 05:12.900]  Yeah.
[05:13.140 --> 05:14.100]  It's fun.
[05:15.980 --> 05:17.880]  I hate when people have to say shit.
[05:18.600 --> 05:19.240]  It's great.
[05:19.900 --> 05:21.860]  Did Gavin finish it with you or did you just find someone else?
[05:21.940 --> 05:23.860]  No, I played separately.
[05:23.980 --> 05:25.780]  But Gavin and I did the first few levels.
[05:26.460 --> 05:27.000]  And that was fun.
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.640]  Do you think you'll continue it?
[05:30.600 --> 05:31.280]  I'd like to.
[05:31.700 --> 05:33.860]  If he ever returns to the country.
[05:36.660 --> 05:38.680]  So, this isn't an award show.
[05:38.780 --> 05:40.320]  It's just showing trailers, right?
[05:40.440 --> 05:40.780]  Yes.
[05:41.140 --> 05:41.720]  Okay, good.
[05:41.880 --> 05:42.580]  This is no awards.
[05:44.060 --> 05:46.060]  Maybe we'll get an Elf cameo.
[05:46.240 --> 05:48.080]  Once again, Geoff Keighley loves Elf.
[05:48.740 --> 05:49.980]  The cat-eating alien.
[05:50.940 --> 05:52.680]  Geoff Keighley loves Elf?
[05:53.300 --> 05:55.240]  Thanks for explaining who Elf is.
[05:55.440 --> 05:57.900]  Well, because there's Elf and there's Alf and there's Alfie.
[05:58.020 --> 05:59.140]  There's a lot of different Elfs.
[05:59.720 --> 06:01.220]  The youngest person here.
[06:01.300 --> 06:02.360]  Hey, you guys know about Elf?
[06:04.180 --> 06:06.040]  When he first said it, I heard Elf.
[06:06.120 --> 06:07.800]  So, to be fair, it did help me.
[06:08.080 --> 06:08.940]  No, I heard Elf.
[06:09.060 --> 06:10.640]  Thanks for all the subs, Midnight Toots.
[06:10.840 --> 06:11.820]  You fart the best.
[06:12.600 --> 06:14.520]  Yeah, Midnight Toots, that rules.
[06:15.120 --> 06:17.420]  Wow, Nick is really... Nick's fucking hyped up today.
[06:17.840 --> 06:18.500]  Markiplier's here.
[06:19.020 --> 06:20.440]  He ate a Waffle House earlier today.
[06:20.560 --> 06:21.780]  Hell yeah. And he's fishing.
[06:22.320 --> 06:24.640]  What life... what life does this guy live?
[06:25.020 --> 06:27.360]  Geoff, that might be the thing murdering things outside your house.
[06:27.500 --> 06:27.860]  Yep.
[06:28.020 --> 06:28.540]  What is this?
[06:29.840 --> 06:31.500]  This looks too scary. I don't like it.
[06:32.540 --> 06:33.120]  Okay, never mind.
[06:34.100 --> 06:36.020]  Oh, is this...
[06:37.900 --> 06:40.940]  It looked like the merchant from Resident Evil.
[06:40.940 --> 06:45.360]  Yeah, I was going to say it's kind of like Dark Souls Resident Evil kind of feel so far.
[06:45.420 --> 06:45.640]  Whoa!
[06:46.540 --> 06:48.780]  This is... yeah, these are all cat-eating aliens.
[06:50.060 --> 06:55.830]  Oh, the predator high-five.
[06:56.710 --> 06:57.090]  Hell yeah.
[06:57.250 --> 06:57.850]  Oh, snap!
[06:57.850 --> 06:58.670]  Oh my god.
[06:59.050 --> 06:59.410]  Oh!
[07:01.970 --> 07:03.250]  Cousin Willy, no!
[07:03.670 --> 07:04.290]  That's awesome.
[07:04.790 --> 07:08.870]  I thought this was going to be like another Souls-like game where it's like, here's some rolling combat, whatever.
[07:09.130 --> 07:11.370]  Whatever this is rocks so fucking hard.
[07:11.370 --> 07:13.150]  This is awesome.
[07:13.350 --> 07:15.190]  This is a video game right here.
[07:15.330 --> 07:16.210]  This rules.
[07:16.430 --> 07:17.830]  This is stabbing, stomping content.
[07:18.030 --> 07:18.610]  Oh my god.
[07:18.710 --> 07:19.750]  Oh my god!
[07:22.230 --> 07:23.870]  This and... oh my... dude.
[07:24.290 --> 07:27.430]  Video games might be fun again.
[07:27.630 --> 07:27.910]  Oh my god.
[07:27.910 --> 07:28.570]  New games are good.
[07:29.450 --> 07:29.930]  Wow.
[07:30.430 --> 07:31.270]  This rocks.
[07:32.890 --> 07:34.570]  I bet you this has a great title.
[07:35.110 --> 07:35.730]  A snail!
[07:36.130 --> 07:36.850]  Oh shit.
[07:37.250 --> 07:37.870]  Gavin's nightmare.
[07:39.570 --> 07:40.690]  He's finally got me.
[07:45.060 --> 07:46.400]  Is this the new Halo game?
[07:50.800 --> 07:53.780]  I would love it if it just said Halo Wars 3 at the end.
[07:56.420 --> 07:58.180]  Where did we go wrong is the tagline.
[08:00.020 --> 08:01.180]  Jesus, this is...
[08:02.540 --> 08:03.760]  Oh my god!
[08:04.020 --> 08:06.000]  Mortal Shell 2!
[08:06.540 --> 08:07.440]  There was a first one?
[08:07.560 --> 08:09.120]  Was Mortal Shell 1 any good, guys?
[08:09.440 --> 08:10.100]  I have no idea.
[08:10.180 --> 08:10.720]  I've never heard of it.
[08:10.780 --> 08:11.400]  I've never heard of it.
[08:14.180 --> 08:16.120]  I'm gonna look it up now.
[08:16.220 --> 08:17.100]  Yeah, no kidding.
[08:19.400 --> 08:20.780]  Mortal Shell is Souls-like.
[08:21.120 --> 08:21.300]  Cool.
[08:21.720 --> 08:23.080]  Yeah, it certainly seemed to be.
[08:26.020 --> 08:27.140]  Risky Reels?
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.200]  Fortnite!
[08:29.560 --> 08:29.860]  Fortnite!
[08:30.240 --> 08:30.580]  Fortnite!
[08:31.520 --> 08:33.240]  I'm doing the... I'm doing the dance.
[08:33.760 --> 08:33.940]  Fortnite!
[08:34.460 --> 08:35.000]  Can't see it.
[08:35.280 --> 08:36.400]  About to announce Benson Boonskin.
[08:38.380 --> 08:40.040]  He only moves in backflips.
[08:40.420 --> 08:40.980]  Oh!
[08:44.980 --> 08:45.560]  Alright.
[08:45.860 --> 08:47.040]  What if...
[08:47.040 --> 08:47.740]  Video in that?
[08:48.060 --> 08:48.140]  Yeah.
[08:50.180 --> 08:53.580]  You see that Destiny is adding a Star Wars campaign?
[08:54.340 --> 08:54.540]  Really?
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.200]  So Destiny...
[08:58.440 --> 09:01.840]  So then Destiny and Fortnite are in the same universe?
[09:02.500 --> 09:06.960]  I think Destiny is doing a weird thing where they're taking all of the imagery from Star Wars
[09:06.960 --> 09:10.840]  and it is a Star Wars affiliated thing, but in world it's not Star Wars.
[09:11.380 --> 09:13.480]  It's just things that look like Star Wars.
[09:14.680 --> 09:16.520]  This appears to be Star Wars.
[09:16.880 --> 09:21.580]  I'll only play this if I can get the Sabrina Carpenter skin and sabotage the Death Star that way.
[09:26.250 --> 09:26.730]  What?
[09:27.690 --> 09:28.170]  I don't know.
[09:28.850 --> 09:29.330]  Jonesy.
[09:29.690 --> 09:30.770]  I don't know who Jonesy is.
[09:31.490 --> 09:32.870]  He was in Rogue One.
[09:35.630 --> 09:37.710]  Well, he's definitely not out of it then.
[09:38.370 --> 09:39.230]  If he was.
[09:40.930 --> 09:41.550]  Cliffy B.
[09:48.790 --> 09:49.810]  This is taking a while.
[09:49.810 --> 09:52.210]  Wow! Andrew, who could have seen this coming?
[09:52.610 --> 09:53.050]  Nobody.
[09:54.430 --> 09:57.110]  Do you know these guys are friends? Did you know that?
[09:57.150 --> 10:00.910]  They're friends and Hideo Kojima hates that everyone's applauding.
[10:01.170 --> 10:02.490]  Because it means he's failing as an artist.
[10:03.490 --> 10:05.090]  Are the Mega64 guys with him?
[10:05.350 --> 10:06.050]  Yeah, no kidding.
[10:07.490 --> 10:09.390]  Kojima's touching all of Garrett's tattoos and going,
[10:09.490 --> 10:10.930]  Oh, cool. So cool.
[10:15.470 --> 10:17.250]  Didn't we have that guy out to RTX once?
[10:17.550 --> 10:17.870]  Yes.
[10:18.990 --> 10:19.350]  Probably.
[10:19.990 --> 10:20.330]  That was cool.
[10:20.710 --> 10:24.210]  He was the special guest of RTX Australia and I thought that was fucking crazy.
[10:25.430 --> 10:26.050]  That's awesome.
[10:26.410 --> 10:27.210]  He was? Really?
[10:27.530 --> 10:31.590]  Yeah, I remember we got in trouble because we threw a Frisbee and it went into his little green room area.
[10:32.490 --> 10:33.570]  And they were like, stop!
[10:37.050 --> 10:38.190]  Maybe I should preface that by saying,
[10:40.010 --> 10:40.910]  it went into his green room area.
[10:40.910 --> 10:42.470]  It went into his green room area again.
[10:43.150 --> 10:43.950]  Oh, I see.
[10:44.050 --> 10:45.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:46.490 --> 10:48.270]  You gotta be specific about that, I think.
[10:50.630 --> 10:53.910]  You didn't realize it was a big deal until you played a future Kojima game
[10:53.910 --> 10:57.830]  and there's a section all about assholes who keep throwing Frisbees into the main character's face.
[10:58.550 --> 11:02.310]  Is that one of those things where you all peel away and point at the one person who threw it last?
[11:02.430 --> 11:02.950]  Yeah, absolutely.
[11:03.610 --> 11:04.050]  Caleb?
[11:05.870 --> 11:06.310]  Gavin?
[11:06.730 --> 11:08.170]  I was gonna say, it looks like Gavin.
[11:08.730 --> 11:10.950]  Oh, it does look like, it smells like Gavin.
[11:11.470 --> 11:15.590]  It's like if you took Gavin's nose and then grew a different person out of it.
[11:17.090 --> 11:18.950]  Is this the newest Strand-type game?
[11:19.550 --> 11:19.710]  Yeah.
[11:21.050 --> 11:26.710]  I started the first one and I watched like a 30-minute cutscene and then stopped playing.
[11:26.990 --> 11:31.390]  I liked it, but that's a very fair criticism.
[11:32.030 --> 11:33.190]  I just need to pick it up again.
[11:33.190 --> 11:34.050]  Mm.
[11:35.730 --> 11:37.330]  Great looking monster energy cans.
[11:38.590 --> 11:39.470]  Nice plant.
[11:40.790 --> 11:41.970]  Ooh, pack of smokes.
[11:42.590 --> 11:47.450]  I thought for a second he was putting his seatbelt on, which seemed really weird to be doing inside of an office.
[11:49.090 --> 11:49.570]  Buckle up!
[11:50.490 --> 11:52.770]  Why did this guy think he could smoke inside an office?
[11:52.990 --> 11:53.670]  In 2025.
[11:54.270 --> 11:55.690]  In what looks like a doctor's office.
[11:59.670 --> 12:01.910]  Do you think this is gonna be a 30-minute cutscene?
[12:02.430 --> 12:02.710]  Yeah.
[12:04.450 --> 12:09.250]  It will be as long as Kojima wants it to be because it's Geoff Keighley and he just went,
[12:09.410 --> 12:10.770]  yeah, yeah, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[12:10.970 --> 12:11.890]  Cut some of these other games.
[12:12.670 --> 12:13.870]  I run a slow-mo channel.
[12:17.030 --> 12:18.210]  Is this Australia?
[12:23.410 --> 12:23.550]  What?
[12:32.960 --> 12:34.820]  Ooh, oh my Morgz, thanks for the subs.
[12:35.180 --> 12:35.640]  Oh my.
[12:35.680 --> 12:36.100]  Thank you.
[12:36.160 --> 12:37.340]  Oh my, oh my.
[12:38.140 --> 12:39.260]  Oh my.
[12:39.260 --> 12:42.340]  Happy affiliate anniversary. Is that us? Is this our affiliate anniversary? Hell yeah.
[12:43.480 --> 12:44.040]  Cool.
[12:45.420 --> 12:46.620]  Use the emotes.
[12:58.880 --> 13:00.000]  Oh shit.
[13:01.180 --> 13:02.540]  They're in the same fraternity.
[13:03.120 --> 13:03.340]  Yeah.
[13:03.540 --> 13:04.500]  They're both Scientologists.
[13:04.860 --> 13:07.380]  Like the worst skull and bones shit you've ever seen.
[13:08.420 --> 13:10.740]  He's like, you and Kappa Phappa too?
[13:12.300 --> 13:13.380]  Kappa Phappa.
[13:13.380 --> 13:15.520]  I'm waiting for the remaster of Kappa Phappa too.
[13:20.110 --> 13:21.110]  What's going on?
[13:21.730 --> 13:22.750]  He remembers now?
[13:23.770 --> 13:27.750]  What's going on is the subtitle of every Kojima game.
[13:28.070 --> 13:28.450]  Yeah.
[13:29.850 --> 13:34.330]  That's very important for people who are really into this type of game.
[13:34.410 --> 13:35.150]  And that's great.
[13:37.900 --> 13:43.710]  I unfortunately am very excited to play Metal Gear Delta or whatever, the 3 remake from Konami.
[13:43.710 --> 13:44.470]  Oh dude, hell yeah.
[13:44.470 --> 13:46.570]  It sucks, but it's going to be so good.
[13:47.710 --> 13:53.570]  I don't know, playing these two guys in an office having a therapy session seems pretty cool.
[13:53.850 --> 13:56.730]  Playing these two guys in an office.
[13:59.030 --> 14:00.010]  Oh man.
[14:04.890 --> 14:07.210]  I'm going to have to hear about this from Rocko like crazy.
[14:08.590 --> 14:09.290]  Oh, is he a big fan?
[14:09.610 --> 14:10.150]  God, yeah.
[14:22.510 --> 14:25.550]  Happy Pride Month to you too, Noah Gray.
[14:25.890 --> 14:26.450]  Nova Gray.
[14:31.150 --> 14:32.170]  Hell yeah.
[14:36.210 --> 14:37.170]  Top that.
[14:45.410 --> 14:47.670]  We can't fast forward, Wyclen, this is live.
[15:05.690 --> 15:06.810]  Where's Geoff Keighley from?
[15:08.590 --> 15:09.410]  I think he's Canadian.
[15:09.910 --> 15:10.450]  Is he Canadian?
[15:10.690 --> 15:11.210]  I think so.
[15:11.210 --> 15:14.210]  The way he keeps saying tomorrow is...
[15:15.430 --> 15:17.610]  Any opportunity for Andrew to claim someone.
[15:17.770 --> 15:18.970]  Yeah, pretty much.
[15:21.030 --> 15:24.190]  Andrew, do you say adults or adults?
[15:25.170 --> 15:27.530]  Oh my god, he's Canadian, you're right.
[15:28.710 --> 15:30.130]  Do you say adult?
[15:30.450 --> 15:31.410]  I think so.
[15:32.290 --> 15:33.670]  He grew up in Toronto.
[15:34.230 --> 15:38.730]  Yeah, I think it's... you get more east. That's where the accent really starts kicking.
[15:40.030 --> 15:41.890]  Where is this occurring?
[15:42.670 --> 15:44.210]  I would imagine San Francisco.
[15:50.750 --> 15:51.910]  She's from that thing.
[15:53.750 --> 15:54.190]  GameSpot?
[15:55.390 --> 15:55.550]  Yeah.
[16:00.950 --> 16:03.210]  It's so cool. Video game journalism is awesome.
[16:04.110 --> 16:08.150]  You just kind of do it until they put you on something else and then you don't have to do it anymore.
[16:08.150 --> 16:08.890]  It's awesome.
[16:08.930 --> 16:10.030]  It's just a stepping stone.
[16:12.130 --> 16:19.370]  Hello Summer Games Fest is so much better than I watch Netflix's To Doom and them constantly saying hello to doom.
[16:26.190 --> 16:28.530]  Is he going to do an interesting accent?
[16:30.510 --> 16:30.950]  Yep.
[16:32.870 --> 16:33.150]  Wizard.
[16:43.560 --> 16:45.220]  Is this Tom Hardy?
[16:45.660 --> 16:46.380]  Is he the knight?
[16:47.280 --> 16:48.680]  No, he's just the narrator.
[16:48.980 --> 16:50.140]  He was the tree, I think.
[16:50.620 --> 16:51.380]  Yeah, he's the tree.
[16:51.480 --> 16:52.700]  He was supposed to be Sam Fisher.
[16:54.720 --> 16:55.400]  Is he really?
[16:55.740 --> 16:56.380]  Is that right?
[16:56.880 --> 17:03.160]  They announced a Tom Hardy-led Sam Fisher movie in 2015 that got cancelled in 2021.
[17:09.060 --> 17:12.240]  People always drop into their knees when they're watching their house burn.
[17:14.500 --> 17:16.400]  What are you supposed to do? Sit down?
[17:17.160 --> 17:18.320]  I mean, I get it.
[17:18.340 --> 17:20.080]  All your chairs are on fire.
[17:20.620 --> 17:22.400]  My wife did that when I broke her old car.
[17:23.400 --> 17:25.720]  Your wife did that when you broke her car?
[17:26.140 --> 17:29.580]  Yeah, remember when I drove into it with the U-Haul? The giant U-Haul?
[17:30.620 --> 17:32.980]  And she dropped to her knees in the Costco parking lot?
[17:33.000 --> 17:33.440]  Yeah, she was like, no!
[17:39.290 --> 17:40.150]  For Honor 2.
[17:44.640 --> 17:46.980]  Boy, this looks like it's going to be complicated.
[17:48.200 --> 17:52.320]  See, I look at this and go, oh, this is just Dynasty Warriors in a different setting.
[17:52.900 --> 18:00.000]  But, like, I want it to be Dynasty Warriors where I'm the guy and everyone, like, I go insane on everyone.
[18:00.240 --> 18:02.600]  But I have a feeling it's like, you still have to control your army.
[18:03.400 --> 18:04.400]  It's like, I don't want to do that.
[18:04.600 --> 18:05.260]  I just want to be a guy.
[18:05.740 --> 18:06.980]  I want every game to be Doom.
[18:07.880 --> 18:10.420]  And what plans do you guys have for the weekend?
[18:10.520 --> 18:12.060]  Mark the Frog's getting Mexican food.
[18:12.060 --> 18:16.640]  I love Mark the Frog so much.
[18:17.240 --> 18:21.500]  He's going to Repticon in Tampa and getting Mexican food.
[18:24.980 --> 18:27.580]  Is Repticon a reptile convention?
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.020]  I would assume so.
[18:31.400 --> 18:34.040]  God, I love this guy so much.
[18:34.160 --> 18:36.260]  And he only does it text-to-speech.
[18:36.700 --> 18:37.920]  He talks into his phone.
[18:38.140 --> 18:38.260]  I know.
[18:38.260 --> 18:39.000]  Everything that you read.
[18:39.020 --> 18:39.740]  Look, Nick!
[18:39.760 --> 18:40.660]  He's fishing right now.
[18:41.460 --> 18:42.700]  You were right!
[18:44.140 --> 18:45.500]  These are really well-liked games.
[18:48.730 --> 18:50.170]  Is that kind of a skateboard?
[18:52.230 --> 18:53.870]  If it's got wheels, he'll race it.
[18:54.670 --> 19:00.470]  This is a pretty cool game to announce right when Mario Kart comes out.
[19:01.030 --> 19:03.210]  We'll probably play this instead of Mario Kart.
[19:04.090 --> 19:05.550]  Andrew won't let us play Mario Kart.
[19:06.030 --> 19:07.290]  Who the hell is that?
[19:07.510 --> 19:10.050]  Green Hedgehog. That's actually my Hedgehog.
[19:10.170 --> 19:11.010]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[19:12.110 --> 19:13.970]  Do we need all these Hedgehogs?
[19:14.030 --> 19:15.110]  I guess we do for the roster.
[19:15.210 --> 19:15.770]  Oh, hey!
[19:17.650 --> 19:18.650]  That's wild.
[19:19.330 --> 19:21.790]  If you don't have a healthy population, they'll go extinct.
[19:22.170 --> 19:22.730]  What?
[19:23.650 --> 19:24.530]  Hell yeah!
[19:24.850 --> 19:26.250]  Are you...?
[19:26.250 --> 19:29.850]  Was that the dude from that game I played?
[19:30.270 --> 19:30.710]  Yakuza.
[19:31.350 --> 19:32.470]  Yeah, Yakuza.
[19:33.450 --> 19:36.350]  They're really doing Mario Kart with Sonic.
[19:36.870 --> 19:38.750]  It's like a Sega Sonic thing.
[19:39.290 --> 19:41.050]  Didn't they do that with Dreamcast before?
[19:41.050 --> 19:42.250]  I don't know.
[19:42.350 --> 19:43.390]  I don't remember.
[19:43.870 --> 19:45.330]  Hey, it's Amy! Everybody's favorite.
[19:48.440 --> 19:50.860]  Do they have Vector in this? Is Vector in this?
[19:51.360 --> 19:53.520]  Is Charmy the bee in this?
[19:54.120 --> 19:55.320]  Crossworlds. Very cool.
[19:56.760 --> 19:59.440]  Coming in September, but that is not all.
[20:00.060 --> 20:05.560]  We'd like to introduce the man behind the creation of everyone's favorite blue Hedgehog, Takashi Iizuka.
[20:06.080 --> 20:08.440]  Oh. It should have just been Sonic the Hedgehog.
[20:08.840 --> 20:09.440]  Thank you, Dave.
[20:10.160 --> 20:11.120]  James Marsden?
[20:11.120 --> 20:15.380]  I would love this dude to be like, well, it's been a rough few years for Sonic.
[20:17.460 --> 20:20.680]  Can you believe we keep getting Jim Carrey to come back?
[20:21.120 --> 20:22.180]  Fucking crazy.
[20:23.400 --> 20:25.460]  The best news about Sonic was the movies.
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.700]  Oh, they should just put Jim Carrey in this game.
[20:27.920 --> 20:30.080]  Not even as a character, just Jim Carrey.
[20:32.620 --> 20:37.980]  Okay, he's making fun of Mario, taking shots.
[20:40.020 --> 20:43.280]  Do you think it's Mario, or do you think it's Garfield?
[20:43.420 --> 20:46.460]  Crash. No, CTR. Dude, Crash Team Racing.
[20:47.040 --> 20:52.000]  Wow. Well, Nintendo, not really known for their cross-platform stuff.
[20:53.560 --> 20:54.820]  Shots fired at Garfield Kart.
[20:59.040 --> 21:05.880]  Oh! It's Minecraft!
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.440]  Yeah, we're playing this.
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.620]  We're playing this.
[21:09.220 --> 21:09.700]  What?!
[21:09.700 --> 21:10.700]  Chicken jockey!
[21:12.980 --> 21:14.600]  Okay, well, we have to do that.
[21:14.980 --> 21:21.220]  Just so the audience is clear, that's the only Minecraft we'll ever play.
[21:21.620 --> 21:24.420]  Why don't we just say we're playing Minecraft and that's the game?
[21:29.360 --> 21:31.000]  Geoff got very quiet after that.
[21:33.560 --> 21:34.700]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[21:40.440 --> 21:41.880]  Ooh! Big ugly ball.
[21:42.940 --> 21:43.920]  No, it's from...
[21:46.020 --> 21:47.400]  The World Spore.
[21:48.000 --> 21:48.780]  Oh, I'm out.
[21:50.300 --> 21:50.740]  Oh!
[21:51.160 --> 21:51.820]  Oh, wait.
[21:52.080 --> 21:52.960]  I might be in.
[21:54.060 --> 21:54.720]  Devil May Cry?
[21:55.460 --> 21:56.280]  That's what I thought.
[21:56.380 --> 21:57.060]  Is that what this is?
[21:57.360 --> 21:58.320]  No, it's Bandai.
[21:58.420 --> 21:58.920]  Bandai doesn't make...
[21:58.920 --> 22:00.120]  Yeah, Bandai doesn't do that.
[22:00.220 --> 22:00.660]  Oh, no.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.540]  And it has a Devil May Cry aesthetic.
[22:04.820 --> 22:05.720]  Oh, shit!
[22:05.960 --> 22:06.620]  That's cool.
[22:06.620 --> 22:08.900]  That is so cool.
[22:11.860 --> 22:12.740]  Oh!
[22:12.960 --> 22:14.880]  Oh, Kong everywhere.
[22:15.900 --> 22:18.220]  Yeah, candle wax all over.
[22:19.320 --> 22:21.040]  Yeah, old finger!
[22:22.460 --> 22:23.400]  It's very Bond-like.
[22:24.980 --> 22:25.540]  Whoa!
[22:28.060 --> 22:29.660]  The monsters look really cool.
[22:33.500 --> 22:35.680]  Put out the candles.
[22:35.680 --> 22:37.720]  I'm an innocent candle face.
[22:38.300 --> 22:38.800]  Wait a minute.
[22:44.870 --> 22:46.530]  I see her heart.
[22:47.330 --> 22:47.670]  Huh.
[22:51.360 --> 22:53.280]  We could have time in a bottle.
[22:54.820 --> 22:56.620]  There's one thing I'd like to do.
[22:57.580 --> 22:58.580]  Nestle thinks of everything.
[23:05.020 --> 23:06.880]  Uh, they... they did it.
[23:07.440 --> 23:07.800]  Oh.
[23:09.600 --> 23:10.180]  They...
[23:10.180 --> 23:11.120]  How do you say this?
[23:15.530 --> 23:16.010]  Hmm.
[23:18.310 --> 23:19.330]  I'm less interested.
[23:20.050 --> 23:23.490]  I'm kind of tired of these worlds that are all messed up looking like this.
[23:24.530 --> 23:26.950]  You don't like the color blue everywhere?
[23:28.030 --> 23:28.190]  No.
[23:29.870 --> 23:32.430]  Cool, a motorcycle you probably don't actually drive.
[23:34.210 --> 23:35.070]  Cutscene motorcycle.
[23:39.280 --> 23:43.940]  The art's really interesting because it seems like it's a mix of, like, a cel-shaded kind of thing
[23:43.940 --> 23:46.960]  and then sort of, uh, like, uh, like those souls-like kind of games.
[23:47.220 --> 23:47.620]  Uh, yeah.
[23:48.180 --> 23:49.940]  Phil's very code-veiny to me.
[23:50.000 --> 23:50.960]  Oh, code-veiny too!
[23:51.080 --> 23:51.880]  There you go, that explains it.
[23:51.880 --> 23:52.500]  Oh, wow, Jack, you called it.
[23:52.560 --> 23:53.540]  That's pretty... that's pretty cool.
[23:54.800 --> 23:56.980]  Well, thanks for the subs, JetSPD.
[23:57.640 --> 23:58.320]  Thank you.
[24:01.690 --> 24:03.530]  Do you think they're gonna show Suda51's new game?
[24:04.410 --> 24:04.950]  They already did.
[24:05.010 --> 24:05.130]  Maybe.
[24:05.590 --> 24:07.810]  I know, but do you think they're gonna show it here today so I can watch it again?
[24:08.150 --> 24:08.870]  I don't think so.
[24:09.350 --> 24:09.910]  Aw, man.
[24:10.590 --> 24:11.370]  What is this?
[24:12.670 --> 24:13.850]  Somebody walking down the hallway, Nick.
[24:14.870 --> 24:15.630]  Repo 2.
[24:17.990 --> 24:19.110]  Oh, definitely not.
[24:23.320 --> 24:24.780]  Oh, another blue place.
[24:28.380 --> 24:31.260]  Oh, this is cool.
[24:32.840 --> 24:34.080]  It's like a top-down...
[24:35.160 --> 24:38.180]  Makes sense that that's a...
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.040]  I thought he had a giant fishing pole out in front of him for some reason.
[24:42.600 --> 24:42.980]  Oh, no, the hail!
[24:44.320 --> 24:45.400]  Oh, I'm into this.
[24:46.460 --> 24:47.840]  Oh, that's cool.
[24:48.420 --> 24:50.360]  They drop you off, you go figure it out.
[24:51.140 --> 24:52.860]  It reminds me of Inside in Limbo.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.400]  I was gonna say, it almost feels like a SWAT unit coming in to clear the offices of Inside.
[24:59.560 --> 25:00.420]  Oh, God.
[25:00.660 --> 25:04.580]  This feels like a game where you're supposed to lose a whole bunch of times before you beat it.
[25:06.060 --> 25:07.820]  Like, roguelike whatever.
[25:08.480 --> 25:09.820]  End of the Abyss.
[25:11.720 --> 25:12.240]  Awesome.
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.020]  Do you think he tried to match his shoes for those two planets?
[25:22.600 --> 25:23.460]  Oh, that's a good call.
[25:23.540 --> 25:24.620]  Because he did perfectly.
[25:24.980 --> 25:26.240]  Yeah, he did, holy shit.
[25:26.600 --> 25:27.940]  Which is not easy to pull off.
[25:28.100 --> 25:28.420]  No!
[25:30.220 --> 25:30.840]  That's a planet!
[25:33.220 --> 25:36.420]  And everybody knows that Jesse Lee is like the Beyoncé of these events.
[25:36.820 --> 25:38.040]  Alright, we gotta play this game, guys.
[25:39.880 --> 25:41.200]  Mighty Mouse, thank you!
[25:41.680 --> 25:42.220]  Gotta help him out.
[25:42.220 --> 25:43.040]  It looks like Ratty Boy.
[25:44.060 --> 25:44.860]  It doesn't.
[25:44.880 --> 25:45.280]  Damn.
[25:45.820 --> 25:46.500]  Nope, not at all.
[25:47.000 --> 25:47.980]  Have you not seen this, Nick?
[25:48.220 --> 25:48.700]  Uh-uh, no.
[25:48.760 --> 25:49.880]  Oh, this is fucking sick.
[25:49.900 --> 25:50.260]  It looks really cool.
[25:50.360 --> 25:51.340]  Oh, I love this!
[25:51.660 --> 25:54.700]  This is something that they showed like two or three years ago at this point.
[25:54.800 --> 25:56.260]  And it's finally coming out, I think.
[25:57.480 --> 25:57.760]  Oh!
[26:01.080 --> 26:01.820]  Holy shit!
[26:01.820 --> 26:04.140]  Yes, it's uh...
[26:04.140 --> 26:06.560]  Less Ratty Boy, more Rat Shaker.
[26:07.020 --> 26:08.300]  Yeah, big time.
[26:08.460 --> 26:10.180]  And it's like, the FPS of it is very cool.
[26:10.180 --> 26:12.340]  Wow, guys, you won't believe who's the voice in this.
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.440]  It's good to see Troy get to work.
[26:16.640 --> 26:18.200]  Wow, honestly, I thought that guy...
[26:18.200 --> 26:20.820]  I didn't know if he was ever going to be in the game again, but hey, good for him.
[26:23.280 --> 26:25.480]  Well, thank goodness after...
[26:25.480 --> 26:28.720]  That was really short for how long that game has been in the back.
[26:28.720 --> 26:28.880]  Yeah!
[26:28.980 --> 26:30.300]  Was that made by the Cuphead people?
[26:31.520 --> 26:33.100]  Uh, I don't know, but it's...
[26:33.100 --> 26:33.160]  Or is it just similar?
[26:33.540 --> 26:35.660]  No, I think it's just like a similar feeling, yeah.
[26:38.780 --> 26:39.100]  RTS!
[26:41.400 --> 26:41.780]  RTX?
[26:43.340 --> 26:44.620]  That would be a fantasy.
[26:46.540 --> 26:48.160]  We can do it at the convention center.
[26:49.580 --> 26:51.100]  You guys seem to get it sooner lately.
[26:51.640 --> 26:53.520]  I sent a picture to Erik earlier today.
[26:53.980 --> 26:56.880]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[26:56.880 --> 26:59.400]  They're making an RTS of Game of Thrones.
[26:59.580 --> 27:00.720]  Yeah, but only the last season.
[27:01.860 --> 27:03.180]  So it's going to be...
[27:03.720 --> 27:04.040]  Bad.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.300]  But you have no idea.
[27:06.740 --> 27:07.940]  True life, Jon Snow.
[27:11.260 --> 27:11.740]  Oh
[27:14.220 --> 27:15.360]  Way of Thrones
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.580]  It sounds like what's his name Charles dance it sure does I
[27:21.540 --> 27:28.860]  Think they're doing a walking dead destinies type thing with this where it's like the characters, you know, but a different story. Oh, that's cool
[27:28.860 --> 27:30.560]  I like what is walking dead destinies
[27:31.100 --> 27:36.840]  It's uh, it's a game that we should really play at some point where it is a choose-your-own walking dead game
[27:37.680 --> 27:44.060]  Yuck like a tell-tale game. No. Oh, oh dear then. I don't know. What do you mean?
[27:45.680 --> 27:52.480]  Did you ever play the tell-tale Game of Thrones game? Yes. Yeah, it was good. Yeah. Yeah, I liked it
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.360]  I think I played every tell-tale game except for the I didn't finish the future one
[27:58.060 --> 28:00.400]  I didn't do that one. I also didn't do the
[28:01.540 --> 28:06.300]  Guardians of the Galaxy. Oh, you know what? I didn't play that one either. What's your fault?
[28:08.400 --> 28:11.340]  Some of the best games ever though. Oh
[28:11.340 --> 28:12.180]  Look, oh
[28:12.820 --> 28:15.940]  Yeah. Oh my god. It's different now. I
[28:15.940 --> 28:17.860]  Mean that's honestly better than the ending we got
[28:18.720 --> 28:23.420]  But that I like everything about this outside of the genre it is in
[28:25.520 --> 28:32.220]  This was an action game, I'm all about this and you'd be cool if it was the same people just different genre
[28:32.220 --> 28:33.580]  So it's like Jon Snow
[28:33.580 --> 28:35.880]  But he looked like Han Solo and he shot a gun
[28:36.840 --> 28:37.600]  Why not?
[28:38.480 --> 28:40.720]  Okay, just asking. Clarity.
[28:42.640 --> 28:45.540]  I love RTS games, so I'm excited about this
[28:48.820 --> 28:51.520]  He's a big Starcraft guy. That's cool
[28:53.960 --> 29:02.160]  All right, now it is time for the global reveal of an FPS action adventure. They should put Hodor in Sonic Racer
[29:04.400 --> 29:06.000]  That was pretty good
[29:08.680 --> 29:09.380]  I
[29:12.680 --> 29:18.180]  Think the Borderlands telltale games are probably the best of the bunch. Red Alert 4
[29:29.500 --> 29:33.180]  Okay, oh we're gonna shoot all the intelligent beings
[29:44.380 --> 29:45.080]  Whoa
[29:49.140 --> 29:49.540]  Huh
[29:50.920 --> 29:55.180]  I was gonna say that kind of felt Atomic Heart like. It looked very much like it.
[29:56.680 --> 30:01.600]  A lot of squeak-wels, dude. These are the new franchises, I guess
[30:02.800 --> 30:08.360]  We'll be doing this in like six years and it'll be Atomic Heart 5. We'll be talking about how far they strayed from the original
[30:10.100 --> 30:15.180]  I never played the first one. Yeah, I guess. Is there anything like this?
[30:17.220 --> 30:23.200]  It looks like this. I don't know if the gameplay is like this, but this is how it looks.
[30:23.340 --> 30:28.060]  Because the gameplay looks kind of like Apex or Titanfall.
[30:28.660 --> 30:32.300]  Oh, yeah, maybe more Titanfall. Run it on the wall. Yeah
[30:33.260 --> 30:34.500]  Minus the mechs, obviously.
[30:36.240 --> 30:42.960]  I think the first game was viewed as having a lot of style, but wasn't necessarily all that much fun to play. Yeah
[30:44.900 --> 30:45.580]  That's me
[30:54.440 --> 30:55.540]  It looks cool
[30:57.160 --> 31:02.760]  Yeah, all the cutscenes that they're showing are very interesting. Yeah, I like these Far Cry 6 scenes there, where they...
[31:04.200 --> 31:05.580]  I did that in Roadcraft earlier.
[31:09.100 --> 31:11.860]  Oof. Okay, yeah. There you go. Get the spice.
[31:13.420 --> 31:13.940]  Oh
[31:16.380 --> 31:16.900]  Okay
[31:28.360 --> 31:33.620]  Huh. It's a video game. Huh, it's pretty much it. The fact that it doesn't even have a year. Yep.
[31:34.900 --> 31:40.860]  And no gameplay? That's right. Atomic Heart 2. Or any whisper of what the plot will be.
[31:41.220 --> 31:47.200]  A spiritual successor to the first game, with a retro-futuristic world on a global scale, and this time
[31:47.200 --> 31:53.620]  there's a greater emphasis on RPG elements and player freedom. But that, believe it or not... Don't make him read all that.
[31:56.020 --> 32:00.520]  They paid a lot of money to make him read all that. Just say that in your fucking trailer.
[32:04.240 --> 32:11.160]  It's in the sky, a giant cube. Oh shit, Peter Molyneux. He's back!
[32:13.720 --> 32:15.000]  Everybody start clicking!
[32:17.200 --> 32:22.920]  He showed up, I was in the lab. I didn't even see it. He was working in his lab late one night.
[32:33.100 --> 32:35.420]  The new sequel to Halo, Cube.
[32:36.780 --> 32:43.360]  What the fuck is that outfit? These guys are in full armor, and that lady's walking around like a sexy schoolgirl. That makes no sense.
[32:43.760 --> 32:46.220]  She's probably a robot. Yeah, it's okay.
[32:47.160 --> 32:49.680]  No, this is Fortnite. This is Fortnite.
[32:51.680 --> 32:55.660]  This is Atomic Heart's Fortnite. Everything needs a Fortnite mode.
[32:57.900 --> 33:04.860]  Maybe this is like their Apex. They took Titanfall and turned it into Apex. It's definitely what it is, right? Yeah.
[33:06.540 --> 33:13.540]  If that's the case, then say goodbye to Atomic Heart and hello to whatever this franchise is they're gonna put all their effort into and abandon the other thing.
[33:15.560 --> 33:19.200]  Good lord. Just a lot of crotch. A lot of crotch!
[33:20.200 --> 33:22.460]  That's not very Borg-like.
[33:24.160 --> 33:27.380]  The Cube. Atomic Universe. That's me. Yeah.
[33:34.800 --> 33:41.960]  They need to make like a fun version of any of these. Like one of these Atomic Heart games need to be good for me to care about.
[33:42.480 --> 33:44.160]  Yep, that universe. Absolutely.
[33:44.940 --> 33:49.140]  That's an MMORPG. That could be something if it is good for us to play with, though.
[33:49.960 --> 33:51.700]  Oh, that'd be interesting to look at.
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.920]  Okay. Dude, I love multiplayer fun. There's four of us on this call right now.
[34:02.360 --> 34:06.760]  There's Geoff. Geoff's popping claws. He's got the Wolverine. He's ready to go. Oh, shit. I'm ready to go.
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.540]  Schnicked. I'm the best at what I do. What I do isn't very pretty. That's me! They start with me!
[34:15.380 --> 34:18.640]  This is great. All of us are in this. Oh, come on.
[34:19.440 --> 34:23.980]  Oh, I'm playing the fuck out of this game. This looks pretty cool. Yeah, I'm into this.
[34:24.780 --> 34:34.700]  Streets of Rage, scrolling, beat'em up. Oh my god. This is all... this and FPS are like the two genres of games that I go to all the time. I love this shit.
[34:36.660 --> 34:41.360]  The Power Rangers one, the Ninja Turtles one, like all of these games are so good.
[34:41.640 --> 34:46.500]  He says FPS, but then he doesn't play Call of Duty. No, I don't play online FPS. Not like that.
[34:46.500 --> 34:50.800]  Look at that. Oh, it's the classic. Oh, this is gonna be so good. I'm stoked. That's awesome.
[34:50.940 --> 34:54.780]  We had so much fun doing a playthrough of the X-Men game in Achievement Hunter back in the day.
[34:54.780 --> 35:01.320]  Cool. I'm so gonna be Wolverine. Capcom!
[35:02.480 --> 35:04.920]  What are they fucking with? Oh, is this Onimusha?
[35:09.320 --> 35:15.680]  I think it might be. Maybe. Do you think they're doing Onimusha in the vein of like, um...
[35:16.380 --> 35:19.300]  You don't have a choice. What are those? What is it?
[35:21.300 --> 35:28.900]  Mirrors? Yeah, yeah, like what? Nier Automata? No, it's uh... Nioh? Nioh.
[35:29.400 --> 35:37.180]  Oh! This feels like that, right? Nioh's a hip-hop artist? No. Yeah. Nioh, the video game.
[35:37.600 --> 35:43.900]  But also, yes. Star Battle Los Angeles. You have to wear a little hat. He knows kung fu.
[35:51.030 --> 35:51.990]  Blergh! Blergh!
[35:56.450 --> 35:56.930]  Whoa!
[36:00.850 --> 36:04.670]  Can we talk for a second about how much fun Sea of Thieves was yesterday?
[36:05.310 --> 36:09.510]  Oh my god, what a blast. Holy shit. We finally played Sea of Thieves, audience.
[36:09.950 --> 36:13.570]  We recorded it. Oh! Yeah, there you go.
[36:14.670 --> 36:20.410]  I like the first one. Sekiro was... you like the one from 20 years ago? Oh yeah, it's the first one.
[36:20.530 --> 36:26.050]  It's the only one I've played. The first one on PlayStation 2. Yeah, Gus and I played that one.
[36:28.250 --> 36:35.630]  I like the first one. It's so funny for this thing. Onimusha's been gone for like 18 years.
[36:36.190 --> 36:41.710]  That was a new look at Onimusha, Way of the Sword, which we announced back in December at the TGAs. It is coming
[36:41.710 --> 36:47.690]  in 2026. Didn't they just release a remake of the second one? I think they did. Yeah, it says
[36:47.690 --> 36:52.870]  they're on Steam right now, 1 and 2, a remake on Steam. There you go. And this next project is what I've been
[36:52.870 --> 36:57.990]  tracking for a few years as a team at Sans String Studios. I'd love to see what his tracking looks
[36:57.990 --> 37:03.770]  like. Like do you think he's got a whiteboard, a bunch of red string? Actually a thing. What you're about to
[37:03.770 --> 37:09.370]  see is running completely in real time in Unreal and I cannot wait to play it. Here is an unexpected
[37:09.370 --> 37:14.070]  new game announcement that combines comedic storytelling. Thanks, Moist Giblets.
[37:15.810 --> 37:18.470]  Dude, I love comedic storytelling.
[37:20.530 --> 37:23.610]  I thought we were getting a Muppets game for a minute and I was very excited. Yeah.
[37:23.830 --> 37:25.770]  Somebody's about to beat the shit out of that Muppet.
[37:43.740 --> 37:48.720]  Was this a Melissa McCarthy movie? Yes, that's exactly what this looks like. Murder Town or whatever.
[37:53.320 --> 37:57.260]  Did you ever watch the show Greg the Bunny when it was on Fox? Yeah. Are you fucking kidding dude?
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.580]  I loved Greg the Bunny. I loved it. I have it on DVD. Oh do you really? Because I am desperate to watch
[38:02.580 --> 38:08.860]  the scene where they try to get the Dracula to say, I, I, and he goes, I eat it. And he can't fucking
[38:08.860 --> 38:16.640]  say it. And I can't find it online anywhere. You can, you can take the discs for a bit. Hell yeah,
[38:16.700 --> 38:24.160]  dude. I don't, what am I, what am I watching? Is this, he keeps saying it's running in real time
[38:24.160 --> 38:32.100]  on Unreal. I don't understand what is a game. This is the game? Yeah. That's fucking crazy.
[38:32.100 --> 38:36.740]  Fulfilling your destiny. That's what that, that's what the game looks like?
[38:39.800 --> 38:42.100]  Yeah, but it's, I just, I don't know. I'd like to,
[38:43.160 --> 38:49.060]  I don't know what this is. I don't either, but like, is that what, huh? Put it on your wishlist.
[38:50.900 --> 38:53.100]  Super fun, gotta wishlist that, right?
[38:57.720 --> 38:59.940]  You can tell that was the mandate for today.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.300]  Oh, I'm so happy I don't have to do this kind of shit. I'm so happy there are Greg Millers and
[39:05.300 --> 39:06.280]  Geoff Keighley's out in the world.
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.040]  Let's go lambs.
[39:24.040 --> 39:26.140]  They're over, they're due any day now.
[39:28.920 --> 39:33.500]  Killer Inn. Oh, oh shit.
[39:39.920 --> 39:46.560]  Dude, if this is anything like that game, The Ship, we'll be fucking set. Do you ever play
[39:46.560 --> 39:52.560]  that game, Andrew? No. Oh, it was a great game for Let's Plays. It's like, it's like a very,
[39:52.560 --> 39:58.880]  like Among Us type game. Yeah, you're on a ship. There's a bunch of NPCs. You get a mission to kill
[39:58.880 --> 40:02.900]  one of the other shipmates and then you have to go kill them without anybody seeing you. Yeah.
[40:02.980 --> 40:06.380]  And they're having to kill somebody too. And so it's just everybody running around trying not to
[40:06.380 --> 40:11.060]  look like humans and killing each other without getting caught. I'm seeing a lot of murder,
[40:11.140 --> 40:22.400]  not a lot of mystery. Yeah, I don't know what the mystery part is. You can't accuse me,
[40:22.400 --> 40:34.400]  I'll kill you. Come on, lambs, let's go. That trailer didn't show much of shit about the game,
[40:34.440 --> 40:41.520]  but I'm interested in it. Should we register and see if we can get in the beta? Yeah,
[40:41.560 --> 40:50.580]  sure. Go for it. We is not me, Nick. It's true. Listen to this guy, Geoff knows what he's talking
[40:50.580 --> 41:29.220]  about. Okay. Oh, this is supposed to be really good. Oh, I like that logo. Sprenza! Ow. Oh,
[41:30.140 --> 41:39.280]  MKNudstrup gave us 10 subs. Thank you so much. Is that your kitchen, Nick? Yeah,
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.000]  cat food everywhere. Well, I thought it was just like cans of tuna or whatever.
[41:44.440 --> 41:46.840]  He eats it to go to sleep like Frank and Charlie.
[41:55.790 --> 42:02.530]  This is an extraction shooter, I believe. You said a distraction shooter? Extraction. Yeah.
[42:02.530 --> 42:05.710]  Oh, you're trying to play, but there's a guy right next to you jingling his keys.
[42:05.950 --> 42:11.370]  Oh my God. What's that? Look over there. What's that?
[42:14.530 --> 42:20.210]  Distraction shooter. Thanks for the subs, Cameron Cardinal. You didn't distract me from that.
[42:20.510 --> 42:21.790]  Thank you. Oh,
[42:24.430 --> 42:30.110]  wear a fucking helmet. Yeah, they had a beta for this game recently and people really liked it.
[42:30.110 --> 42:34.830]  Oh, really? Yeah. Is it FPS or third person? FPS, I believe.
[42:38.610 --> 42:46.430]  We already saw this. Oh, distraction shooter. That's what I'm saying. Number one distraction
[42:46.430 --> 42:52.430]  shooter right there. I'm willing to give it a shot. Yeah, me too. Get it because it's a shooter.
[42:53.770 --> 42:55.470]  Oh, but he's genius.
[43:02.380 --> 43:08.010]  Which console? All right, Dune fans. Here you go, Nick.
[43:10.950 --> 43:15.430]  I know this is really dumb. I haven't seen any of the Dune movies,
[43:15.690 --> 43:21.910]  largely because I just think the nose thing looks really dumb and I can't get over it.
[43:22.430 --> 43:25.990]  You said that and I'm like, what nose thing? It didn't even clock with me right away,
[43:26.030 --> 43:30.490]  like what you're talking about. Any screenshot I see of that movie, it's them with the nose thing
[43:30.490 --> 43:36.490]  on. That's so funny. I just like, so I just like, don't even like, I don't even like clock it when
[43:36.490 --> 43:41.170]  I'm watching the movies. That's interesting. I think it just looks so stupid. I totally,
[43:41.310 --> 43:44.890]  I mean, I understand. I've never seen the new ones. I've only seen the David Lynch one.
[43:45.290 --> 43:50.750]  They are, they are good movies that I feel nothing for. That's that Villeneuve dude,
[43:50.750 --> 43:56.810]  did that right? He's the one that did the second. He did, he did Arrival. He did Prisoners.
[43:58.390 --> 44:03.470]  I always forget the name of Arrival. What's the sci-fi one? Well, those are all sci-fi. Dune?
[44:05.050 --> 44:12.330]  No, with Harrison Ford. Or he's an android. He's a replicant. Oh, Blade Runner. Yeah,
[44:12.390 --> 44:18.270]  Blade Runner. He did the Blade Runner 2048 one, right? Yeah. That's a beautiful film. He's a,
[44:18.270 --> 44:22.710]  he's an incredible filmmaker. I'm a really big fan of Denny Villeneuve, but like,
[44:23.830 --> 44:30.030]  Dune is just a thing where it's like Lord of the Rings to me, where it's, it's just,
[44:30.330 --> 44:34.230]  hey, do you guys know this is like an allegory for religion? It's like, yeah,
[44:34.310 --> 44:38.650]  no, I mean, I get it. And they're like, right, because it's a, it's like that. It's very,
[44:38.650 --> 44:43.710]  I get it. I feel very similar to the Final Destination franchise, which I just finished
[44:43.710 --> 44:51.070]  on that class. Right there with you. Those movies are so much fun. Dude, they are so good. I
[44:51.070 --> 44:56.370]  fucking loved every single one of them. Everybody says four is the worst. I guess it was, but it was
[44:56.370 --> 45:03.570]  still fucking good, dude. Oh no. Oh no. They divided into their enemies. They were friends,
[45:03.690 --> 45:09.970]  now enemies. But a house divided cannot stand, Nick. She had my share of the spice. How do I get
[45:09.970 --> 45:23.080]  back? Every time I see the worms. Thanks, Phil. Pickies. Pickles. He was all excited. Gifted
[45:23.080 --> 45:27.640]  subs. He's all excited for you to read his name. I'm trying to make the experience memorable for
[45:27.640 --> 45:33.920]  Phil Pickles. Shoot him. Damn, y'all aren't observing at all. They were right there.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.840]  They were right there. Where's the worm? Show me the worm. It looks like,
[45:38.840 --> 45:46.040]  you guys remember that movie Powder? You guys ever seen that film? This dude looks like powder.
[45:46.240 --> 45:51.060]  He's powder-esque, bro. He's gonna run off into the into the fucking rain and turn into lightning
[45:51.060 --> 45:58.820]  at the end of this game. Yep. I know like Dune is epic universe type like amazing visual thing,
[45:58.960 --> 46:03.180]  but all I know about is they wear no shit and they're all upset about spices. So it's once
[46:03.180 --> 46:09.520]  again, it's another. Also, they pee in their suit and it's recycled. Yeah, and then they drink it.
[46:12.540 --> 46:18.040]  Did they even show the worm? No, they didn't show the worm. Did they? Yeah. Did they show
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.760]  the safton? I didn't see any spice representation. It's true. Spice rats stand up.
[46:26.540 --> 46:28.860]  Elbow deep daddy. Oh boy, you can name yourself anything.
[46:28.860 --> 46:36.820]  I feel like we've seen a lot of video game trailers today that look like a lot of the same
[46:36.820 --> 46:42.340]  games. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Big time. Like we've seen this one three times now. A hundred percent.
[46:43.220 --> 46:47.840]  The Sentinels just fixed the fucking text earlier. Why do we have to watch you do it?
[46:48.240 --> 46:56.100]  Oh, again? I kind of like it. Andrew's a big clock guy, so he's kind of a big clock text guy. Yeah.
[47:01.460 --> 47:05.960]  Can we go back to watching Rocket Raccoon again? Dude, they're hiding gameplay behind those fucking
[47:05.960 --> 47:11.500]  sideways letters. They're like, the longer we take to set the letters right, the less shots we
[47:11.500 --> 47:21.470]  have to include of an undone game. Maynard's Hands of Fate? Yeah. That's awesome. Is this like
[47:21.470 --> 47:27.410]  Remnant 3 or something? I think Remnant has more shooting. We'll probably fucking play it,
[47:27.410 --> 47:36.350]  whatever it is. Chrono Odyssey. Huh. Well, at least there's not a 2 behind it. It just seems
[47:36.350 --> 47:42.610]  like it should be Chrono Odyssey, like one word, and it's weird that it's two. I mean, good for
[47:42.610 --> 47:49.130]  them. I got no problem with that. Is this the same game? Yeah. That would be crazy if it was the same
[47:49.130 --> 47:56.110]  game. Look, dragon. There was a dragon in the last one. People fighting like that? Definitely in the
[47:56.110 --> 48:02.710]  last one. This looks like... I don't know what Shin Megami Tensai is, but I assume it's this.
[48:09.470 --> 48:16.110]  I'm thinking this is a different game. What happened while I was out?
[48:25.170 --> 48:27.070]  They should just reskin this and make it Ruby.
[48:29.950 --> 48:34.550]  Why not? I don't know who they are, but I agree with you.
[48:35.150 --> 48:42.010]  Well, I am Bear Warrior, gifted 50 subs. Oh, fuck. Thank you so much. Holy shit. That's a
[48:42.010 --> 48:46.470]  lot of saiyans. Wouldn't it be cool if anytime you got gifted a sub, like two days later, Jimmy
[48:46.470 --> 48:52.170]  John showed up at your door? Yeah, it'd be pretty cool. Oh, I like this one. That's so many. I am
[48:52.170 --> 48:58.530]  Bear Warrior. You truly are a warrior of bears. Yeah, this looks cool. This looks cool. Action
[48:59.270 --> 49:09.340]  platformer? No, thank you. I think I'm out of town the week you guys play Mio Memories.
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.200]  Whoa, generally disinterested, posted some sort of a red diamond
[49:17.780 --> 49:21.980]  crystalline structure that has a number 10,000 next to it. I think that might be a lot.
[49:22.340 --> 49:27.220]  Oh my god. Wow. Thank you so much. Absolutely love the work you guys do. Super funny and always
[49:27.220 --> 49:32.320]  entertaining. Please never stop. For you, we will continue. Thank you so much. Also,
[49:32.380 --> 49:38.340]  there's a guy out there called DG Geoff in the chat who is definitely not me, obviously. Oh,
[49:38.340 --> 49:43.220]  really? Yeah, I'm him. I'm fake Geoff on Twitch. Oh, then we should probably thank you very much.
[49:43.320 --> 49:45.800]  Right. I don't know that he's trying to be me. It could just be a coincidence,
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.720]  but just think it's a coincidence. What? That his name is drunk gamers, Geoff as well. I mean,
[49:52.620 --> 49:57.540]  seven and a half billion people on this planet, Eric. I can't assume that I'm the only one 20
[49:57.540 --> 50:01.780]  years ago. Oh, this is is this the same game we were just looking at? It's a split fiction.
[50:02.720 --> 50:10.220]  Oh, this could be even more split. This is a different Geoff here. No, it's not. Yeah. You and
[50:10.220 --> 50:14.880]  I should play this. I don't want to. I don't want to look at that. What's the what's the movie where
[50:14.880 --> 50:22.480]  the the Coraline? This is like Coraline. Oh, yeah. Not quite that bad. I hate it. It is a lot
[50:22.480 --> 50:29.960]  that they don't announce. I'm in and they must scream. JJ Quartz is here. Finally made a stream.
[50:29.960 --> 50:34.500]  Now we can get started with the party. Everybody take your dicks out. There we go. And finally,
[50:34.500 --> 50:41.680]  entry in the acclaimed Mafia franchise. Diddy Kong. Diddy Kong. Dexter. It is Dexter Griff with
[50:41.680 --> 50:49.740]  one F. Oh, no. You mean for that? No, that's not. Drunk gamers. Not actual gameplay, guys.
[50:57.670 --> 51:01.470]  Mafia. Mafia. The old country, right? I thought maybe it was NBA 2K.
[51:08.190 --> 51:11.430]  It's going to be great. We're at the end of this press conference. They reveal every
[51:11.430 --> 51:19.890]  character we've seen is in Sonic Racing. That's so awesome. Maybe not after this trailer.
[51:20.910 --> 51:25.010]  I think especially with this trailer. Yeah, they're right in the jalopy.
[51:32.270 --> 51:39.510]  It's pretty exciting that Mafia stuff became so sort of like prolific in the United States
[51:39.510 --> 51:44.870]  that we needed to do Mafia stuff in Italy, which is not like Mafia stuff in the United States at
[51:44.870 --> 51:48.090]  all. But we're like, it's going to be like the same. It's fine. You know what you're reminding
[51:48.090 --> 51:54.190]  me of? A little movie I like to call Equalizer 3. Is that right? Oh, yeah. It's all about the
[51:54.190 --> 52:04.090]  Italian mob in Italy. Oh, interesting. I love the ending to that movie. I really like it.
[52:04.490 --> 52:11.470]  It is a great ending. Oh, look, the tank tickler gave a hundred purple diamonds of some kind.
[52:11.930 --> 52:17.990]  Thank you. I just learned about these these little objects. Bits. And that they're money.
[52:18.150 --> 52:22.130]  Yeah, I found out on one of my streams yesterday and I've been ignoring them the entire time.
[52:22.890 --> 52:28.630]  That's pretty cool. Yeah, you're pretty good at this. I'm figuring it out. Thanks for sending me
[52:28.630 --> 52:32.930]  those shapes, guys. It's only been about a year. Thanks for all the shapes. Yeah.
[52:33.730 --> 52:39.090]  Well, I retroactively thanked everybody, so. Oh, OK. Well, that's I bet this is Lego. Crazy.
[52:40.310 --> 52:46.010]  Well, gave it away. I mean, Bernie and his kids used to play these fucking Lego games nonstop.
[52:46.450 --> 52:51.030]  Oh, really? Michael Jones, too. Michael Jones may be the biggest Lego game fan in the world. He was
[52:51.030 --> 52:56.270]  he's all about those. He'll pick one and just go for it. Yeah. Forever and ever and ever.
[52:57.890 --> 53:02.890]  It was like split fiction Lego style. Shadow Shadow Airplane forgave me on behalf of all
[53:02.890 --> 53:08.870]  of the audience. Oh, that's cool. Oh, wow. Oh, this is going to be a game that you hate, Eric.
[53:09.270 --> 53:18.350]  This is a lot of making for content. I'm OK with this. This is like this human fall flat.
[53:18.350 --> 53:23.910]  Yeah. The building. Oh, yeah. If it was more than two players, I think this would be like really
[53:23.910 --> 53:31.690]  crazy. The two players is probably the right amount of characters for this. Yeah. Get five
[53:31.690 --> 53:36.270]  on there, I think is a big mess. All right. So Gavin and Eric should play it, right?
[53:37.350 --> 53:39.590]  Maybe this can be your show. You guys keep working on it, right?
[53:40.350 --> 53:44.850]  Zombies Rock 991 said a duo Lego game. Oh, fuck. But I don't know how to read. Oh,
[53:44.850 --> 53:49.010]  fuck. Is he saying, oh, fuck. Like, oh, fuck. Or like, oh, fuck. Or like, oh,
[53:49.110 --> 53:58.920]  fuck, I'm coming. Probably the last time, I think. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Voyager. Cool.
[54:00.500 --> 54:06.840]  Voyagers. Definitely the third one. OK, got it. Hello, Summer Game Fest.
[54:07.220 --> 54:11.200]  Hi, Carolyn Lawrence, voice actor for Sabrina Carpenter for a second.
[54:11.200 --> 54:16.860]  I've grown up with Nickelodeon, some with squirrel suits, thank you. Some with science
[54:16.860 --> 54:23.680]  smarts and some with serious attitude. Nickelodeon has always been about wild worlds and weirder
[54:23.680 --> 54:29.220]  characters. And while I'm mostly sworn to secrecy today. About to announce a Hey,
[54:29.260 --> 54:32.900]  Arnold Souls-like and revealing something that brings a lot of those characters.
[54:33.200 --> 54:38.380]  I'd play that. I would absolutely play that. I hope you enjoy the first look at Nicktoons
[54:38.380 --> 54:44.580]  and the Dice of Destiny. Yeehaw! Oh, she's the squirrel. I get it. Yeah, she's Sandy Cheeks.
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.540]  I didn't quite understand what was happening. It's like Gwen, but Nickelodeon. Yeah. Yeah,
[54:50.580 --> 55:00.890]  this is Gwen. I love Gwen. Is this Borderlands?
[55:05.030 --> 55:07.130]  Main villain is Dan Snyder.
[55:15.590 --> 55:17.390]  Oh, God, I hate it already. Oh, there's Gavin.
[55:19.650 --> 55:27.270]  This is kind of Tiny Tina's Wonderland, I feel. Yeah, big time. I could never bring myself to
[55:27.270 --> 55:33.890]  watch Spongebob. Oh, really? I didn't watch it. I didn't watch it at all. That was Millie's age,
[55:34.070 --> 55:40.550]  so I watched a lot of Spongebob through her. Yeah, very good. It made my nephews too
[55:42.550 --> 55:45.130]  hyperactive, so they stopped letting them watch it.
[55:56.770 --> 56:01.350]  This is one of the best mechanics in a video game is lifting up a fucking heavy door.
[56:01.930 --> 56:08.950]  One-handed fucking. It's like, no, no, no, all the way. We've seen a lot of balls hanging from
[56:08.950 --> 56:14.510]  things in this. It's the theme, Summer of Balls, baby. Is this that ball we saw earlier hung from
[56:14.510 --> 56:21.370]  the sky? Yeah. Oh, we've seen a lot of these things, too. I think you already showed this
[56:21.370 --> 56:29.210]  trailer. Yeah. No, this is a Pokemon, not Pokemon, Pinocchio. Pokemon? Dude, this is what Pokemon,
[56:29.570 --> 56:35.570]  I would play Pokemon. There's Wolverine. Or Vega. Did they say what this was? Did they say
[56:35.570 --> 56:45.390]  this was Lies of P? Lies of P DLC. OK. Oh, I never played Lies of P. Lies or lives? Lies. What are the
[56:45.390 --> 56:55.690]  lies? This is all lies. Those are his lies to tell you. It opens with based on a true story and then
[56:55.690 --> 57:05.210]  it ends with gotcha. Dude, you know what got me for the most of my life? Have you ever seen the
[57:05.210 --> 57:10.530]  Peter Weir movie Picnic at Hanging Rock? No. Oh, yeah. I talked about that not too long ago, I think.
[57:11.050 --> 57:14.250]  Like, you and I, I think, just talked about it. Oh, maybe. It's one of my favorite movies of all
[57:14.250 --> 57:18.910]  time, but it starts off based on a true story and then you find that it is not. And I spent most of
[57:18.910 --> 57:24.690]  my life thinking it was real. Yep. I've seen the same with Fargo. Like, not every part of it,
[57:24.750 --> 57:30.450]  but just like the base premise of... Yeah. Well, yeah, Fargo is not based on a true story. They
[57:30.450 --> 57:33.590]  put it at the beginning and I think Francis McDormand went, you can't do that. They said,
[57:33.590 --> 57:38.650]  why not? It's a movie. And it was like, oh, that's fucking awesome. They did that for the
[57:38.650 --> 57:42.850]  Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Yeah. I think we're going to get a kick out of this announcement too.
[57:45.640 --> 57:53.100]  Oh, help! Uh-oh. Dude, we are in sync with the keelmeister. Yeah, we're locked in.
[57:56.570 --> 58:00.690]  Don't cry, blood. Oh, her blood's running.
[58:00.690 --> 58:10.010]  Oh, this is going to be... Oh, I don't like... Did he sit in four of the chairs?
[58:13.530 --> 58:19.170]  This is like that game Gone Home. Yeah. Where you go home and everybody left you.
[58:22.150 --> 58:27.450]  I don't, I don't... Yeah. Yeah. I don't like this. Oh, I'm going to play this.
[58:28.670 --> 58:32.970]  This is like when you put on like, uh, you find like an ASMR video that's like, this mimics
[58:32.970 --> 58:38.370]  schizophrenia and you listen to it and go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I love horror games.
[58:38.690 --> 58:43.990]  This is schizophrenia. This has been a great summer game showcase for you, Nick,
[58:44.210 --> 58:50.130]  because everything has been gross. Well, horror versus body horror. Scary horror.
[58:52.830 --> 58:58.790]  Hmm. Fractured blooms. Crazy. Man, we are, we are scratching the bottom of the barrel
[58:58.790 --> 59:03.630]  on names for shit. Yeah, we are. No offense to them. Everything's been taken. Goddamn.
[59:06.310 --> 59:11.650]  So what's the true story part? Do you think of this? I'm excited to find out. She was a gardener.
[59:12.170 --> 59:18.630]  Yep. I too once cut up tomatoes. Mark the Frog says, I'm shocked that no one else in the chat
[59:18.630 --> 59:26.210]  is out fishing. I saw it also. I love this guy so goddamn much. I love it. He doesn't even
[59:26.210 --> 59:31.630]  understand how much we like him. He has no idea. It's the best. Sometimes he'll be in my chat and
[59:31.630 --> 59:37.450]  he'll send like, and it like a crazy looking like diatribe thing. And it's just about like,
[59:37.470 --> 59:42.010]  gods are falling and like, why do we suffer? Whatever. And I'm like, what is this? And he's
[59:42.010 --> 59:46.210]  like, oh, sorry, chat. Wrong chat window. That's for Warhammer. It's like, oh, okay, cool.
[59:47.830 --> 59:51.870]  That's for Warhammer. Yeah, it's awesome. It's the best. Blade Soul Neo. Yeah, there you go.
[59:51.990 --> 59:57.190]  It's that. It's that. The beast of metal endures longer than the flesh of men. Like,
[59:57.290 --> 01:00:02.850]  look at that shit. We'll be playing WWE 2K25 and he sends that and then he goes,
[01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:14.490]  oh, that's for Warhammer. Insane. A dog. This. Oh, this looks like a Dreamcast game.
[01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:20.870]  It looks like all the other games we saw already. I'm not trying to be negative, but holy shit.
[01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:26.630]  Can we get a different kind of game? That was turn-based. No,
[01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:30.310]  that was completely different. Oh no, the tigers!
[01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.770]  Oh, fire. Oh, cell.
[01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:47.450]  Or I'm, I'm asking this and I don't mean it as like an insult. I mean this like
[01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.750]  genuinely, are these all phone games?
[01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:57.510]  Like, does anyone know? I don't think any of them have been. No? Okay. Well,
[01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:02.270]  they all have a mobile vibe to them. Not all, but a lot of them. For sure.
[01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:12.150]  Oh, for God's sake. One Punch Man. Oh. What's he doing here? You're probably going to tell me
[01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:15.310]  that this trailer is different than the one we just watched where I was bitching.
[01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:21.890]  That's going to be Nixon. Yep. Oh, the boots. Red boots. Don't give me the rest of the outfit.
[01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:29.350]  I can't pull it off. Crystal of Atlan. That seems like the easiest game on earth to win.
[01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:34.270]  One Punch Man. Absolute nightmare as a punch-out character.
[01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:38.510]  Don't look out. There's a girl out here shooting at tigers. You guys need to be careful.
[01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:44.150]  I can't this be based on a true story.
[01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:51.910]  What? The 7 Deathly Sins origin. I think it's supposed to be, actually.
[01:01:56.010 --> 01:02:01.530]  Now we are one minute away from the normal bog standard best time of the week. I'm fishing. I'm
[01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:09.090]  in. I'll play it. It's Mark 2. Guys, get your 501s ready, but just know we're taking it to 601
[01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:13.950]  today because we're taking you all the way through the end of Summer Game Fest. Don't listen
[01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:19.730]  to the name. There have been more than one game. We've seen so many, including 7 Deadly Sins origin.
[01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:27.850]  Or we've seen one hour of the same game. Yeah. Oh, that's a pig demon kind of thing. That's cool.
[01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:34.590]  Camels. 7 Deadly Sins is a lot more colorful than I would have anticipated. Which sin do you think
[01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:42.470]  was? Wrath, maybe? Yeah. How about this one? Wrath. This one? A guy like me is only looking
[01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:44.510]  for pride, you know what I'm saying? Gluttony, you know what I mean?
[01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:55.310]  501, boys. 501! Best time of the week. A celebration, and you're celebrating with us
[01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:58.950]  on a Friday afternoon. Thank you so much. Somebody asked if we remember our 7 Deadly
[01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:01.770]  Fruit Sins. I forgot about this. Oh, yeah. We did do that.
[01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:11.550]  Witcher 4! Yep. Oh. Jesus, guys. Ah, it's Predator Killer Killers.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.920]  It's an ad for another one of these. It's just cash. Yep.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:28.800]  Human creator is now fully integrated into Unreal Engine. You're seeing me live in real time.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:35.760]  Crazy. This quick game will be coming to UEFN. You're talking about the Fruit Sins? I have a
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.760]  WWE 2K25, a game that we played for a Let's Play, and we're like, oh, we should do this with more
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.280]  characters or whatever. I actually have someone who made a bunch of characters in the game,
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:50.180]  and I'm really excited to play with you guys again and put together a show.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.460]  So jazzed to do that. Is it people on that list I gave you that time?
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:03.320]  Yes. Hell yes. But if anyone else out there wants to make some stuff, make it in 2K25,
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.800]  the next gen edition or whatever, and put the tag as regulation. But I want to thank
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.720]  Joseph DeCuglia. I think that's how you say his name. He did a really cool job.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.480]  Oh, awesome. He's the one that made the shows. It's going to be awesome.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.140]  Yeah, those were great. Yes. Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.920]  So Joseph Julia Guglia. Okay, pretty cool.
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:28.580]  Well, if anyone else is doing that, just put it on the Xbox or whatever, like the next gen one
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.360]  and regulation. So is this Jurassic Park or is it just dinosaurs?
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.440]  It's Jurassic Park. Okay. Or world, I guess.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.120]  I guess we have two park games. The evolution or whatever.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.500]  Yeah. Yep.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.960]  Yep. Evolution 3.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.460]  I have the first one. Oh, that just makes me think of
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.700]  road craft the way they're building that. Do you play it on the hardest difficulty
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.140]  like Last of Us 2, Nick? No, I'm terrible.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.500]  Is this like roller coaster tycoon, but it's dinosaurs?
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.580]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.960]  Oh. That's fun.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.040]  They want you to go ahead and pre-order it. They don't want you to put it on your wish list.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.040]  They didn't get the memo, apparently.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.480]  Hi, I'm Celia from Yacht Club Games.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.420]  Hi, Celia.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.940]  Ten years ago, we broke new ground with our first game, Shovel Knight.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:20.580]  Oh, cool.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.940]  Well, that's a game I never played.
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.420]  It's cool. If you like Game Boy and stuff, it's a fun game.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.280]  They weren't snapping at each other, Pigeon Studios, Jim.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.660]  It was playful puppy banter.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.880]  It's a bone chilling adventure that they explore with their mouths, just like a bulldog.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.280]  And precise platforming.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:46.180]  As Mina, a whip wielding hollower, you'll burrow through danger and unravel
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.880]  the mysteries of a cursed island.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.760]  A decade ago...
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.640]  Did she say island or Ireland?
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.520]  A cursed Ireland.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.320]  Okay.
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:06:00.710]  I like the music.
[01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.110]  I like how it looks.
[01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:04.790]  Yeah, I told you, Geoff. If you like Game Boy, this is your shit.
[01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:08.370]  Do you think that they were originally called Bored Ape Yacht Club Games,
[01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:09.670]  and they cut the first part off?
[01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:10.730]  Yeah, they had to change it.
[01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:11.270]  Yeah.
[01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:17.270]  Yeah, this is...
[01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:24.310]  I'm happy that you guys are gonna play this, probably.
[01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:28.250]  This is a game where I don't think I will play, but I like looking at it.
[01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:28.910]  Me too.
[01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:29.610]  I like that this exists.
[01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.630]  I will definitely not play this game.
[01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:34.030]  It seems brutally hard.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:38.580]  Oh.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.240]  Cool.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:41.680]  Mm-hmm.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.460]  Eric, it's you.
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:43.440]  Mina the Hollower.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.440]  Oh, somebody says that's a cuck game.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:47.940]  Interesting.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:48.720]  Cool.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:50.400]  What a normal thing to say.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.260]  What an insane way to live.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:53.840]  What the hell?
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:54.840]  Yeah, that's a...
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.240]  Yeah, that's a cuck game.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.600]  Understand how or why.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:06:59.140]  Yep.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.040]  Just like to hold that in your, like, in your brain.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:05.660]  In your brain.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.100]  Cuck game.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.680]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:08.340]  That was a cuck game.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:09.020]  Hey, Geoffy.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.400]  You're gonna watch somebody else play it.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.820]  Oh, that's great.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.500]  You're killing it at the fest with your oodles of totally natural charisma.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:21.880]  Available.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.840]  B, I'm at your house playing long darts with the fam.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:30.240]  And three, you're gonna do me a solid and skip that silk song trailer
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.380]  so you can pay my revolutionary VR gaming venture that will shock the...
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:38.980]  I'm not bad about seeing my name and fucking big flashing lights everywhere.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.200]  Oh, it's Deadpool.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:43.840]  Oh, boy.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.400]  I hope it's funny.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.520]  Oh, cool.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.360]  It's on the... it's MetaQuest.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.420]  That means I'll never play it.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.380]  Tell it to my heart.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:02.840]  Great song.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:03.560]  Taylor Dane.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.280]  Yep.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.240]  That's good.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.500]  Hopefully, this brings the song back.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.260]  I love this song.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.360]  It is a good song.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.380]  Maybe you and I could bring it back.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.560]  I'm fine with that.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.140]  I'd love to.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.260]  What's it called again?
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.400]  I like the song a lot.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.000]  Two of Hearts.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:20.900]  This isn't Two of Hearts.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:21.640]  No, no, no.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.300]  Two of Hearts is the other song that I think of.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.560]  Two of Hearts.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.980]  Two hearts to be that as one.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.900]  This is Tell it to my heart by Taylor Dane.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:31.580]  Tell it to my heart.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.360]  I can't believe it.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.160]  Only one.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:39.480]  Who's in love or just a game?
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.780]  Who got the lobotomy with fries?
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.220]  All your dreams...
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.240]  You ever played VR stuff?
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:47.400]  Yeah.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.220]  He's played it for a while.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.740]  I've played it, but...
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.540]  Is that Omega Red?
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:52.760]  I think so.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:53.220]  Huh.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.620]  Wasn't Omega Blue.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.500]  I'm craving Korean barbecue now.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:57.460]  Is that weird?
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.120]  I don't know who that was.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:01.300]  I don't either.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.140]  The Mega Green.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.180]  With Neil Patrick Harris as Deadpool.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:08.720]  All right.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:09.920]  Next year at Gamescom...
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.740]  Neil Patrick Harris as Deadpool?
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.200]  What a choice.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:13.900]  Is that what they said?
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:14.540]  Yeah.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:15.000]  That's what he said.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.740]  What the fuck?
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:17.280]  Crazy.
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.260]  Al Crane is back as the player character in this title that blends open world and action
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.140]  survival horror.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.560]  Let's take a look at the latest trailer with some big news.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.380]  Oh, this is good because Nick loves horror.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:28.600]  Yeah.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.460]  I don't know what it is.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:35.960]  It's scary.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.080]  Dead time.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.580]  Oh, a zombie game.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:39.340]  Oh.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.420]  I do like zombie games.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.020]  Oh, keep your eyes peeled for MILFs.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.220]  This could be right up Nick's alley.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.420]  He's a narcissistic sociopath.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.520]  He's experimenting on humans like they're lab rats.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.840]  God only knows what the Baron's planning to do with those monsters.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.800]  Only knows.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.920]  Is this like a Dying Light thing?
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.380]  Maybe?
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.760]  I never played that game.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.260]  I didn't play that game much.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.540]  I played the first one a little bit.
[01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:14.240]  Yeah, I think...
[01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:17.590]  I never played Dying Light.
[01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:24.270]  I think it was turned off from that style of gameplay after Dead Island.
[01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.710]  Dead Island and Dying Light are very similar gameplay if I remember correctly.
[01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:29.410]  And I wasn't jazzed about either.
[01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.370]  Too cumbersome and not as complicated and not fun.
[01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:34.770]  Right.
[01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:36.770]  Games should be fun when you play them.
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.000]  Maybe Days Gone will get a second game.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.740]  You think so?
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:49.780]  Was that a good game?
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.280]  I liked it.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.980]  This is where you ride around on a motorcycle, right?
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:54.420]  Yeah.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.060]  It didn't do well at first, but I think it had like a pretty big...
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.620]  It had like some crazy late life where people are like really into it way too much.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.560]  Did it just take a lot of people to get into it?
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.520]  Or did they patch it and improve it?
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:07.520]  Both.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.280]  Yeah, they definitely both.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.280]  I played it.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:11.220]  I think it's like free.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:11.780]  There you go.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:12.120]  Dying Light.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.240]  I think I played it on PlayStation because it was like a free game or whatever.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.160]  And it's like...
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:17.940]  It's fun.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.120]  It's very fun.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.640]  The story's okay.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:21.820]  But the story's not great.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.340]  Dying Light the Beast.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.160]  There was a season of Alone called that.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.100]  Alone the Beast.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.520]  Now we're ripping off TLC.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.140]  Hell yeah.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.540]  There's the big news.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.640]  Dying Light the Beast is coming on August 22nd.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.220]  I've decided to be the negative guy today, by the way.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:39.500]  Okay.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.080]  That's cool.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.700]  I ain't got no problem with that, man.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.560]  I mean, by and large, video games kind of suck.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:45.460]  So I'm with you.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.440]  Mixtape comes from Beethoven Dinosaur and Annapurna Interactive.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.020]  And this is your exclusive new look at this game that plays like...
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:55.780]  I'm excited for this.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.080]  ...to teenage memories.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.020]  What are we doing?
[01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:06.050]  I'm getting buzzed.
[01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:08.290]  I've got to get out of this place.
[01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:10.270]  These games are all about style.
[01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.410]  Yeah.
[01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:17.210]  What are the games of these people, man?
[01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:19.350]  I'm blanking the name of it.
[01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.690]  It was a music game.
[01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:23.130]  Uh, where you like...
[01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:23.850]  Parappa the Rapper.
[01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.590]  Yes.
[01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.910]  Yeah.
[01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:25.830]  Yeah.
[01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.850]  This is their second game.
[01:12:31.190 --> 01:12:32.070]  Is it a music story?
[01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:33.530]  I don't remember.
[01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:41.350]  And this year, experience a retrospective like no other.
[01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:42.450]  Wait.
[01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:44.710]  Beethoven and Dinosaur invites you to...
[01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.270]  This is not a music story at all.
[01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.390]  I skateboard and hit baseballs...
[01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:51.570]  ...before school's out.
[01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:53.150]  ...and toilet paper houses.
[01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:55.050]  Yeah, I'm pretty...
[01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:55.690]  I like that it's all...
[01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:56.930]  I like that it's all in the twos.
[01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.570]  Like, the, uh...
[01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.290]  Ooh.
[01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:59.670]  ...animation for it is really cool.
[01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:00.930]  Good music, too.
[01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.550]  Yep.
[01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.730]  Except for Silvershare.
[01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:03.190]  Fuck them.
[01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:03.930]  But the rest of it's...
[01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:04.770]  I'm with you.
[01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:12.230]  I like the aquarium.
[01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:17.030]  Okay.
[01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:20.710]  I'm into that.
[01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:21.570]  I hope it's multiplayer.
[01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.670]  It's a game pass.
[01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:24.290]  I don't think it will be.
[01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:26.190]  No, it's gotta be a single-player game, right?
[01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:27.030]  Shouldn't be.
[01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.650]  It should be multiplayer.
[01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:29.850]  Then we could all play it together and it'd be fun.
[01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:31.950]  What about this one?
[01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:33.510]  But, uh, we don't want it to have fun, I guess.
[01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.330]  That can be three of us.
[01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:34.890]  Oh, that's me.
[01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.950]  I'm that one.
[01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:37.830]  I'm Fish.
[01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:38.670]  You're the Fish.
[01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:41.970]  Tag yourself, I'm the Fish.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.680]  Oh, look.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:10.800]  Not that these games aren't gonna be great, but there is a lot of similar art style to these games.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:16.240]  And I am not someone who typically enjoys this style of art for games.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.040]  Like, the games that they represent.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:21.660]  But there are plenty of people that do, and they must be having a great time.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:25.360]  It's been a strong summer game showcase for them, for sure.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.840]  They got 40 games that all look exactly like this.
[01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:33.630]  I do want to be that Fish guy, though.
[01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.750]  I hear that.
[01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:39.970]  We fight for a future filled with hope.
[01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:44.730]  That was me trying to conjure extra box office dollars for Funnel System Bloodlines.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.500]  Seems like the industry is heading in a direction.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.860]  I think it's been going in this direction.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.330]  It seems like Geoff lifted his head up long enough to see the...
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.860]  I think that, like, the direction, though.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.520]  That's why I asked if these are, like, mobile games.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.340]  Because all, like, mobile games look like that.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.800]  And now, like, actual games look like that.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.840]  So I don't know. Very interesting.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.020]  That definitely looks like a mobile game.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:14.720]  Right?
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.920]  Action beat him up, Eric.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.800]  Now we're talking, baby.
[01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:32.130]  Ooh, skull.
[01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:37.730]  I don't know if I could play this because of the nose thing.
[01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.910]  Not me.
[01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:44.210]  Well, it doesn't speak to Andrew.
[01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:45.370]  He's never had a hurt nose.
[01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:50.670]  Andrew just sees weak nose and he's like, I can't, I can't relate.
[01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:55.950]  If I'm being honest, this fighting style is kind of lackluster.
[01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:57.810]  A little sluggish.
[01:15:58.090 --> 01:15:59.850]  Nick, please, I'm the negative one. Let me do it for you.
[01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:00.370]  Oh, sorry.
[01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:01.670]  This looks boring as fuck.
[01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:02.530]  There you go.
[01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:06.990]  I think there's a, like, oh, we want to, like, keep some realism to it.
[01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:08.810]  And it's like, oh, that's not why I'm playing the video game.
[01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:10.710]  Yeah, that looks real.
[01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:14.450]  It's like when you see, like, giant fighting robots and they go like, oh, yeah,
[01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:16.010]  this is, like, how fast they would actually move.
[01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.410]  And it's like, oh, I don't think you understand.
[01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:18.890]  Giant fighting robots don't exist.
[01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:20.030]  You can do anything with them.
[01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:21.570]  I like this.
[01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:23.610]  I'm into this.
[01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:29.250]  I like it in closed space fighter.
[01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:30.250]  Oh, that was sick.
[01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:32.850]  Oh, I like it in closed space fighter.
[01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:33.910]  This looks pretty cool.
[01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:35.950]  Whoa, shit.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.420]  I'll give this a try.
[01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:48.250]  They're in the apartment.
[01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:49.630]  It felt very raid-like to me.
[01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:50.930]  And I'm all about that.
[01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.250]  Big time.
[01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:52.850]  Andrew, I felt the exact same way.
[01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.990]  Axe of Blood is also a sick name.
[01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.310]  All right.
[01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:57.450]  That's a great name.
[01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:58.370]  That is a cool name.
[01:16:59.110 --> 01:17:01.070]  In a world of fractured blooms.
[01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:03.010]  Thank God there's an Axe of Blood.
[01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:05.230]  It does.
[01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:06.270]  It looks very Sifu.
[01:17:06.650 --> 01:17:07.350]  It looks like Sifu.
[01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:19.490]  Oh, I like Shredder's Revenge quite a bit.
[01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.190]  Yep.
[01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:22.230]  Is this Scott Pilgrim?
[01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:38.550]  Someone has to do something.
[01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:39.490]  Yeah, so there you go.
[01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:39.910]  That is Scott Pilgrim.
[01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:40.990]  You called it.
[01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:46.030]  Like, from the beginning, it sounded like Onomataguchi or someone ripping them off.
[01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:49.390]  And then this looked like this game.
[01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:50.910]  I had a friend that worked on this first one.
[01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:53.230]  And I really liked it.
[01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:55.270]  And then you couldn't buy it for like 10 years.
[01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:56.430]  Oh, really?
[01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:56.890]  Yeah.
[01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:58.810]  I did not like this game.
[01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.950]  Really?
[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:01.010]  Oh, I love this game.
[01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:02.610]  Like, this style of game is like my favorite.
[01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:03.490]  I just love it.
[01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:04.070]  I don't like the property.
[01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:04.670]  I don't like that.
[01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:05.350]  I didn't like the game.
[01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:06.850]  It was big in the Achievement Hunter office.
[01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:09.250]  I think a lot of people played it, but I just couldn't get into it.
[01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.050]  This is...
[01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:11.550]  You're not the...
[01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:14.330]  You are not the demographic for this thing.
[01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:17.710]  And as I get older, the more I go, it's embarrassing how much I like this.
[01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:23.010]  I feel the same way about Weezer, where it's just like...
[01:18:23.010 --> 01:18:25.230]  It's fine that I liked it at the age that I liked it.
[01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.410]  But like, I can't do it anymore.
[01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:30.270]  You put on Pinkerton now and you just go,
[01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:33.250]  Okay, as long as there's no one else around, this is fine.
[01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.550]  Yeah.
[01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:35.530]  I'm alone in my car and it's quiet.
[01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:36.050]  Exactly.
[01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.110]  Yeah, it feels very similar.
[01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:43.410]  I really liked the comic. The comic was a lot of fun.
[01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:44.970]  I gotta say, I never read the comic.
[01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.610]  I've only seen the movie.
[01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:46.050]  Never read the comic?
[01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:48.890]  I mean, it was good. It's just the same kind of shit.
[01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:51.130]  Never read the comic, never saw the movie.
[01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:52.970]  Well, you didn't miss much on the movie.
[01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:54.290]  No, no, they were...
[01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:56.430]  I mean, the comic and the movie were like the same thing.
[01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:58.930]  Like, if you watch the movie, it's like the same shit.
[01:18:59.250 --> 01:18:59.770]  I didn't do either.
[01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:03.150]  But first, we have a very special message from Maggie Robertson,
[01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:07.970]  TGA winner in 2021 for her performance in Resident Evil Village.
[01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.030]  Are we in Resident Evil?
[01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.790]  Oh, is she...
[01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:16.210]  Oh, that lady.
[01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:17.290]  She did the voice, yeah.
[01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:17.950]  Yeah.
[01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:21.470]  We had that game already.
[01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.970]  Is it like a VR version? Does that exist yet?
[01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:27.730]  I think it... I think there already is a VR version.
[01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:29.550]  There was for 7.
[01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:33.970]  Okay, it's just like a general...
[01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:37.150]  This better end in a new Resident Evil.
[01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:38.750]  Oh, it's a sale. There you go.
[01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:39.730]  It's a Capcom sale.
[01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:42.410]  You mother...
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.240]  If... We better get a Resident Evil game with Jill and Leon.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.360]  Whoa.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.240]  Nick.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:56.680]  Whoa.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.400]  They're just like...
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:00.900]  I spilled!
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:07.000]  He just... Dude, you just do yourself no favors. It's the best.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.360]  Whoa, I spilled everywhere.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.520]  So gratuitous.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:19.300]  Eric, have you ever seen the Shane Gillis show on Netflix Tires?
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.320]  No, I haven't watched it. Is it worth watching?
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.280]  It's all right. Nick reminds me of somebody in the show, but if you haven't seen it, it won't matter.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:26.900]  Okay.
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:28.880]  I don't know how to take that.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.340]  Is it like the manager guy? Like his homie?
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.100]  Yes, the manager guy. Yeah.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.580]  Getting in his own way kind of guy?
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.120]  Yeah.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.480]  What do you mean?
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.140]  Uh...
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:41.760]  I'm the bear.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.360]  A glorious morning has dawned.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.040]  The f*** is going on here?
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.900]  On something that's simply...
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.080]  Oh.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:57.780]  Scum.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:03.760]  Hmm.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:04.980]  Geoff, thoughts?
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.580]  What is...
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:08.480]  Pee pee on a burger, Geoff.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:09.980]  I don't know what it is, man.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:10.280]  What?
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.520]  Is it a multiplayer?
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.200]  It's definitely multiplayer.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.780]  Yeah, I think that's the only thing is that it's multiplayer.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.700]  I mean, I'll f***ing play it.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.940]  But what kind of multiplayer?
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.420]  Is it co-op multiplayer or is it...
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.640]  You know what it felt like was...
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.680]  I think it's like Rust.
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:26.900]  Okay.
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.660]  Yeah, what's like that...
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.640]  That extreme sports game where you're like...
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.360]  It's by like a Ubisoft game where you're like flying up the...
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.520]  That game that I play all the time.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:38.580]  Yeah, it felt like that, but with...
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.360]  But you kill people.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.880]  What do we got here?
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.360]  I'm so excited for this.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.320]  I think it is going to be terrible.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:47.920]  But I'm very excited.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.080]  It's called Mind's Eye.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.960]  It comes out in like four days.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:51.840]  Oh.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:57.520]  It is a producer of GTA 5 left, made his own studio and made this.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:00.240]  And just everything around it has been disastrous.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.040]  What do you mean disastrous?
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:05.460]  Is this the one that's supposed to be like Cyberpunk?
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.680]  It looks like kind of like...
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:06.980]  Sort of.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.520]  Yeah, it looks very GTA 5 in the gameplay that they have shown.
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:17.200]  Just like two heads of the studio just left, like right before the game comes out.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:22.140]  And they were saying things in the press, like implying that Rockstar has been
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.080]  paying for people to put criticism against their game.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.620]  Just crazy shit.
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.000]  This is the game where the head of their legal department left
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.620]  right before the game launches, right?
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.000]  Yes.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.960]  OK, I have heard about this.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.120]  I'm very excited.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.440]  I'm going to play this.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.720]  I'm going to play this.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.820]  I can't wait to play this now.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:45.700]  There's a weird create your own story, like builder within the game.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.340]  So it's unclear, like how much of it is like expected the audience to create.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.140]  Yeah, like a forge thing.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.160]  Is there multiplayer?
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:55.240]  Oh!
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:55.680]  Oh!
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:57.600]  Look at that, Andrew.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.740]  OK, I was ironically in before.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.780]  Now I'm unironically very in.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.240]  This is this is the guy, right?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.880]  Uh, no, this is the head of IO Interactive.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.200]  I think he's unaffiliated with Builder Rocket Boy.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:17.100]  And yes, you may have noticed Agent 47 will be contracted
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.380]  for a very special assignment in.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.880]  Yes, I love how that is.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.320]  We're putting Hitman in this game in a very limited way.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.560]  This is not a Hitman game.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.240]  We are not affiliated.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.080]  Yeah, a very special assignment.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:30.960]  You will see him for 8 minutes.
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:31.580]  This looks so cool.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:32.720]  I can't wait for first light.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.580]  This week we finally revealed 007 First Light to the world.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:35.400]  Yeah, this looks very cool.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.260]  And your reactions were heartwarming.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.260]  It's coming in 2026.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.860]  But we want to make the wait more exciting.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.400]  We are bringing someone into Hitman, the World of Assassination,
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.960]  who is very dear to the Bond universe.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.660]  This rocks.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.280]  Are we going to kill Sean Bean again?
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.620]  I love IO Interactive.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:55.800]  They might be my favorite developer.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.700]  Whatever this is, we got to play it.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.160]  Are they putting Pierce Brosnan in Hitman?
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.260]  Wait, wait.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.220]  Le Chiffre.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.100]  That's so cool.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.420]  Oh, we got to do this.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.320]  Oh, we are going to get Le Chiffre.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.600]  That's very cool.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.120]  I've invited these people for a reason.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:23.760]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.780]  Mr. Rengang, he's back.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.360]  Do you think you can sit down and play cards with him?
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.740]  Oh, you absolutely should be.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.020]  That's such a Hitman thing.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.640]  Oh, you can poison his eye drops.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.460]  Rangekai 55, you got to whack his balls.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:42.200]  Oh, we're playing poker with him.
[01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:52.970]  Oh my god.
[01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:54.630]  I'm buying it.
[01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:56.250]  I don't even know if I have to.
[01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:56.930]  I'm buying it.
[01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:58.710]  Well, we got to film it.
[01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:04.950]  You can't play it till Gavin gets back.
[01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:07.870]  I see, but he's never coming back.
[01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:11.750]  Mark the Frog said he's never seen a James Bond movie.
[01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:16.650]  That reads...
[01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:17.750]  I mean, yeah, that checks out.
[01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:21.250]  Oh, Amazon owns the license to this now, huh?
[01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:23.490]  Yeah, they just have been putting it on.
[01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:27.290]  There's a huge push they've been making of like,
[01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:29.710]  all the Bond movies are now streaming on Amazon Prime.
[01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:30.490]  Wait, what?
[01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:34.250]  Oh, Mads is here.
[01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:35.430]  Interesting.
[01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:37.790]  Hey, are they ever...
[01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:40.310]  Are they ever going to bring back Hannibal?
[01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:41.750]  No.
[01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:42.170]  No.
[01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:43.930]  No, I think it's not coming back.
[01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:50.010]  He doesn't...
[01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:52.610]  He doesn't give a fuck about this.
[01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:53.270]  This rocks.
[01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:58.550]  Kojima wouldn't hire me back.
[01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:01.230]  So I said, fuck you.
[01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:10.910]  It is rare to be a Bond villain, get killed in the Bond movie,
[01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:13.530]  and then get to replay that character like 10 years later.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.100]  I played Mark the Frog says,
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.720]  I played Quantum of Solace for PS2, but I didn't have any memory cards.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.280]  So I only played the first level over and over again.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.500]  Quantum of Solace was great.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.320]  That A, that was a good game.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.160]  That is an old school video game problem that we all dealt with.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.340]  It's a better game than movie.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.220]  Every time we get new lore with this guy, man, it's really something.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:58.720]  Yeah, sure, whatever.
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:01.900]  Yeah, shut the fuck up.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.620]  Let me read these lines.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:08.380]  Well, I think they're saying that you can just literally play poker,
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.580]  which is awesome.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.540]  Oh, that's funny.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.160]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:21.360]  Goddamn, Mark the Frog said breakfast at Walthouse is $16.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:23.080]  That's expensive, man.
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.020]  Should be like $8.95.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.740]  It's those fucking hash brown tariffs.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.160]  Oh, cool.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.540]  Probably like a gunskin, I imagine.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:45.860]  Oh, man.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.780]  I'm on the Xbox store right now.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.420]  It isn't available.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.240]  Put Hitman in a Lego game.
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.880]  Yeah, dude, I'd play Lego Hitman.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.520]  Oh, that'd be great.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.060]  Lego Hitman would be really fun.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.180]  It's garotz people's heads off.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:07.440]  Yeah.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:09.640]  Oh, this could be fun.
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.440]  A lot of Lego this time around.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.540]  If this is like Mario Party, we'll play Mario Party.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.000]  Are we doing this 30 turns in 30 days?
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.100]  They wouldn't do that to us.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.100]  Would we do that to us?
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.100]  We would do it to us, but I don't think the Lego people would.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.080]  Oh, we gotta, we gotta do it.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.820]  I mean, we're definitely playing this.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:38.020]  We have to play it one way or another.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:38.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.720]  It's just, I don't think there will be 30 turns.
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:41.820]  60 turns.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.760]  I think with 60 games.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.040]  Yeah, a turn for every game.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.180]  60 mini games doesn't feel like a lot.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.100]  I wonder how many Mario Party has.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.260]  Like 100 and something, 125 or something.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.260]  Smashing a crate?
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:02.120]  Those were literally just on screen.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.060]  Something I've never considered, but like makes sense.
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.240]  It's, it's so smart.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:14.520]  Yep.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:19.200]  Looking, uh, looking forward to that.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.700]  I think it's interesting that it's the Nintendo Switch 2 logo is just Nintendo Switch.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.400]  Next, a new look at a new team shooter from Dream Haven and Moonshot Games.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.420]  20 players across five ships venture into the most treacherous region of space.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.780]  Hoping to get their hands on the artifact.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.760]  The game is called Wild Gate and the open beta starts next week during Steam Next Fest.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:46.340]  And we're also very happy to announce the game will launch on July 24th for PC,
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.260]  PlayStation 5, and Xbox.
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:52.880]  Let's see what it means to get into some serious space shenanigans.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.680]  He almost fumbled shenanigans, but he pulled it off.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:58.900]  Way to go, Geoff.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.520]  This vicious circle?
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.520]  That was my exact thought.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.480]  I was just like, don't say it, don't say it, don't say it.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.660]  Oh, I'm so glad we're recording this.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:23.860]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:24.880]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.700]  That really tickled me, man.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.920]  Well, I aim to entertain.
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:41.780]  Also, it genuinely is the first thing I thought of when I saw this color.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.820]  It looks so similar.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.060]  This is slower, though.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.280]  Yeah, you want the speed.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.880]  You want to play... what's it called?
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:53.920]  What?
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:54.720]  Split?
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.540]  Wild Gate.
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:57.760]  Yeah, wild whatever.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:30:59.520]  Wild Circle.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.600]  Hell yeah.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.820]  Love Guacamelee.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.940]  Nobody Saves the World was also really good.
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:20.380]  Blighted.
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.140]  Mmm, Blighted.
[01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:31.110]  Guacamelee, that's another popular game I never played that wasn't my thing.
[01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:32.110]  Yeah, loved it.
[01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:33.890]  Never played it.
[01:31:34.170 --> 01:31:34.990]  It was like a Metroid game.
[01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:39.890]  What the hell?
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:52.540]  Oh, not Sorcisto.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.080]  No, Sorcisto, no.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.880]  Oh, Hades.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:09.300]  Yeah.
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.660]  So this is historically accurate.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.420]  We have to kill Sorcisto.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.020]  Oh, the horse thing.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.680]  Okay, that's co-op.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:23.340]  I like that.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.620]  Yeah, I think they said that it's like you and a friend.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:27.260]  It's like, okay.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.400]  Oh, this is the Eric and Andrew game.
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:30.900]  I'll play it.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.740]  Hey, Eric, Andrew really wants to play it with you.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.900]  I've been hearing that.
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.680]  Yeah, he just messaged me to ask you for him.
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.740]  Unpossiblers, thank you for the five subs.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.340]  Second hand butt plug.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:49.860]  What a name.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.680]  Oh, my God.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:54.660]  It's a new team of 50 with founders in Canada and Armenia.
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.680]  They partnered with the new Munfish powerhouse label.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:04.420]  Insane Unreal Engine five game to life with unpredictable monsters and visceral dismemberment.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.300]  Ooh, is your first look.
[01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:16.770]  Oh, team clout.
[01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:20.210]  I'm little thingy.
[01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.910]  Oh.
[01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:24.350]  Oh.
[01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:29.310]  What's the game where you're in like the insane asylum or whatever that we played?
[01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:33.530]  Uh, outlast trials.
[01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:35.490]  That's what this looks like.
[01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:36.510]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:37.710]  Yeah, but with a gun now.
[01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:38.110]  Yeah.
[01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.050]  Or maybe like killing floor.
[01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:43.990]  Yeah, kind of like killing floor.
[01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:47.110]  Damn.
[01:33:48.810 --> 01:33:49.770]  Gunplay looks good.
[01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:53.650]  Yeah, it looks scary.
[01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:58.590]  Oh, my God.
[01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:59.690]  Oh, man.
[01:33:59.890 --> 01:34:00.970]  I kind of want to play this.
[01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:01.790]  Oh, wow.
[01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:04.010]  Dismember reminds me of Resident Evil seven.
[01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:05.830]  Yeah, I can see that too.
[01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:08.390]  Shoot him in the leg.
[01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:09.110]  Dead space.
[01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:10.630]  That's very dead space.
[01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:10.910]  Yeah.
[01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:14.670]  Back off.
[01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:15.530]  Fuck up.
[01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:19.190]  Oh, my God.
[01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:20.150]  That was a big head.
[01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:21.430]  Ill communication.
[01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:22.070]  Beastie boys.
[01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:25.250]  Oh.
[01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:28.050]  Oh, it's the.
[01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:32.090]  It's the baby from train spotting.
[01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:33.910]  We got a child kicker game.
[01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:36.410]  Oh, poor little babies.
[01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:36.970]  All right.
[01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.430]  I'm into that.
[01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:38.770]  It is one of 2025.
[01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:39.410]  I'll play.
[01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.970]  I play that.
[01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:41.030]  I'll play the hell out of that.
[01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:46.530]  Previous beta amassing over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam and three million players
[01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:47.090]  in total.
[01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:52.330]  In this game, you explore a sci fi universe of pilot powerful mechs with immersive aerial
[01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:52.830]  and ground.
[01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.610]  Hello, Gundam.
[01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:54.610]  No kidding.
[01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:55.350]  We're stabbed.
[01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:56.330]  He's probably flipping out.
[01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:57.050]  Yeah.
[01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:59.310]  Well, he's not because it's not officially Gundam.
[01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:00.510]  Yeah, it's important.
[01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:02.810]  Is Mecha Brake's latest trailer with the answer.
[01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:08.330]  When is Mecha Brake going to come out?
[01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:09.190]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:13.410]  I'm not going to watch the fucking news.
[01:35:14.650 --> 01:35:15.910]  I tricked again.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.280]  At least they're playing my favorite song.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:24.780]  Yeah.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.660]  I can't wait to hear this in Luminous.
[01:35:38.130 --> 01:35:39.810]  He actually plays the teddy bear.
[01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:41.530]  Oh, finally.
[01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.010]  So do you think they've been living amongst these rocks this whole time?
[01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:47.810]  And then suddenly they all the rocks stood up?
[01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:50.210]  What do you think they were doing?
[01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:54.870]  Or do you think they were just like running through this desert and then got attacked by
[01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:55.290]  rocks?
[01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:56.310]  I don't know.
[01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:59.510]  But I want a movie called The Day the Rock Stood Up.
[01:36:03.450 --> 01:36:06.410]  It's crazy that dog tag is still the way to identify people.
[01:36:06.610 --> 01:36:06.930]  But all right.
[01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:11.050]  Classics.
[01:36:11.130 --> 01:36:11.970]  Classics for a reason.
[01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:12.670]  Yep.
[01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:14.010]  We need you back.
[01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:20.670]  We should make a Fast and Furious mech game.
[01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:22.390]  Hell yeah.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:31.800]  Yeah.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.060]  Show me gameplay.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.040]  This is just watching anime and I don't do that.
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:44.140]  Yeah.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.880]  I think you've been doing it for about an hour and 30 minutes.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:47.560]  No!
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.800]  The only anime I watch is Huckleberry Hound.
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:58.240]  I'm having fun watching this trailer, but as soon as it ends, I'm never like it's gone.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:59.500]  I'm never going to remember this.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:05.900]  Wishlist.
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:10.420]  I wish they showed gameplay.
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:14.460]  Small soldiers?
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.220]  Grounded 2.
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:26.860]  Give me Chip Hazard.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.960]  It's Bug?
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.840]  It's Bug?
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:42.340]  Is Ants?
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.380]  Is Ants Life 2?
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:52.540]  Wow.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:55.080]  Pikmin, but gritty.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:56.780]  Gritman?
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.400]  Gritman!
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.460]  Are we going to wait for Death Stranding 3 to get Gritman?
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:02.920]  Yeah.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.520]  Star Wars?
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.900]  It sounded like Star Wars for a second there.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:22.660]  Having this be on Earth, like just in the garden, is such an interesting choice.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.860]  Yeah, what a great idea.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.040]  What, like, that's so interesting.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.220]  I want to know what's up with the world that's bigger than them.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.160]  It's gone or what?
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.220]  It's all happening in somebody's backyard.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.400]  It is.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:36.960]  That's so crazy.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:37.960]  Cool.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.780]  You should put small soldiers in that game.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.600]  Yeah, dude!
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.360]  I do play Grounded.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:45.760]  It's Conflame.
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:46.260]  It's good.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:47.380]  It's great.
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.300]  Love Grounded.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:52.480]  Hard.
[01:38:56.590 --> 01:38:57.470]  Half-Life 3.
[01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:58.830]  Master Chief Smokin'?
[01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:59.050]  Oh.
[01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.790]  Yes!
[01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:01.290]  Yes!
[01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:07.730]  Oh, wait, oh, no, wait, wait, hold on, wait, what is it?
[01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:09.550]  This might be a remake of, like, the original.
[01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:10.950]  Don't get, don't get excited.
[01:39:12.010 --> 01:39:13.430]  We don't know if this is 9.
[01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:18.570]  Okay, they're just, they're just fucking around right now.
[01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:20.450]  I think it's for the Capcom sale again.
[01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:22.910]  If it's the Capcom sale again.
[01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:28.090]  All of our games are half-off!
[01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:29.230]  Go buy our games!
[01:39:34.210 --> 01:39:35.990]  30th anniversary, that's crazy.
[01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:38.870]  With our 30th remake of episode number one.
[01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:39.670]  No kidding.
[01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:42.210]  That is probably...
[01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:42.850]  And zero.
[01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:47.690]  Code Veronica remake now.
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:56.050]  Oh, that was...
[01:39:56.050 --> 01:39:56.210]  Nah.
[01:39:56.650 --> 01:39:57.050]  Are you...
[01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.430]  Hey.
[01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:05.630]  Aww!
[01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:09.330]  Boo! Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo!
[01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:09.950]  Why bother?
[01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:14.130]  That was hilarious.
[01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:16.570]  Oh, there's you, uh...
[01:40:16.570 --> 01:40:17.210]  Oh, hell yeah!
[01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.710]  Hang on, wait.
[01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:21.090]  Are they doing another fight for...
[01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:23.210]  No, this has to be, like, Final Fantasy or some shit.
[01:40:23.670 --> 01:40:24.410]  Oh, it is!
[01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:26.010]  Fuck yeah, it's Street Fighter!
[01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:29.910]  Kenny Omega is Alex, fuck yeah.
[01:40:35.230 --> 01:40:36.030]  Is this...
[01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:40.630]  Wait, so what...
[01:40:40.630 --> 01:40:42.030]  So what game is this?
[01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:43.170]  Is...
[01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:44.630]  If this is Sea Viper...
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.700]  I'm so fucking mad right now.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:57.860]  Okay, I feel better.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.000]  Crazy.
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.100]  Anyway, check out Creating Character Podcast.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.340]  Is this Capcom, like, Fighting Evolution 2 or some shit?
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:20.240]  Like, what is this?
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:23.660]  Oh, this is the announcement for them in 6!
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.100]  Oh my god!
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.740]  Oh, Sagat looks crazy.
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:32.640]  Wow.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.400]  That's a good strategy.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.620]  They just added Elena and that was pretty cool.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:49.420]  I'm very into this.
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.100]  I'm less into this if it's PvP.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.240]  That's exactly what it looks like, huh?
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:11.060]  Yeah, I was thinking it would be like a co-op...
[01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:11.180]  Yep.
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:12.620]  ...type thing.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.020]  Still like the art quite a bit.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:15.880]  Yeah.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:17.700]  Stylish.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.080]  Very stylish.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.720]  This is like a Team Fortress game, right?
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.220]  It seems like it.
[01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:28.550]  Phil Spencer?
[01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:33.190]  Last flag.
[01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:37.070]  Okay, if it's just to capture the flag game, I'm kind of into it as well.
[01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.730]  I'm back.
[01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:40.610]  It looks sort of like it's capture the flag.
[01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:42.250]  It's definitely.
[01:42:42.930 --> 01:42:44.750]  Or at least capture the last flag.
[01:42:46.290 --> 01:42:48.730]  Oh, and then you have to hide it and defend it?
[01:42:50.690 --> 01:42:51.630]  It's pretty cool.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.620]  It is very Team Fortress 2 inspired.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.120]  I was briefly hoping it was like time splitters related.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.600]  Oh god, I remember time splitters.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.300]  Oh, time splitters.
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:32.920]  Oh man, I haven't thought about that game in ages.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:43.660]  Okay.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:59.320]  Hey, Nick, check it out.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.020]  A bleak world.
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:00.940]  Hey.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:04.780]  Is that seat made from bone?
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:05.240]  Oh.
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:07.000]  Oh.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.140]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:15.620]  Oh, that's cool too.
[01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:37.390]  Bird lady.
[01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:40.390]  Go birds.
[01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:45.550]  One day someone will make a bleak world full of milfs and feet and Nick will be sad.
[01:44:50.290 --> 01:44:53.290]  Nick will not understand that it's a bleak world.
[01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:57.130]  And I will be rich and full of life.
[01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:01.130]  Sleeping on the worms again.
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:07.600]  Feels like a Frank and Charlie thing.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.100]  Oh, she was playing Nightcrawlers.
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:11.580]  Okay.
[01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:16.510]  Brass line.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:27.540]  What?
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.340]  What?
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:29.460]  What?
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.540]  Are they doing a remaster of the...
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:33.720]  What?
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.340]  What do we have going on here?
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:39.780]  Or is it a new Wu-Tang game?
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:47.860]  And it's probably like soundtracked by RZA?
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:48.800]  This.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.600]  Hell yeah.
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:51.420]  Oh, this.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:52.920]  Yeah, dude.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:54.880]  It's like Creamery.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.460]  Oh, I'm so into this.
[01:45:57.860 --> 01:45:58.020]  Yep.
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.760]  Yeah, this looks a lot like all the other games I saw today, but they have me at Wu-Tang.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.600]  Presented by Ghostface.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.060]  Interesting.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.460]  Make another W-shaped controller, you cowards.
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:12.340]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:18.560]  Ghostface killer is calling on you to rescue him.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:19.840]  Yeah, he is.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.880]  All right, all right.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.300]  Cool.
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.140]  With anime style fighting.
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:29.500]  And it's the debut title from the 53 member Brass Lion Entertainment.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.400]  Her left hand is just doing circles.
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:35.400]  I was gonna call it out earlier, but I didn't feel right doing it,
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:36.960]  because it was still pretty early in this thing.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.460]  That's her move.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:41.800]  You can take advantage of double XP all weekend long.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.900]  Double XP, Geoff.
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:47.720]  Yay.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.240]  Guild Wars 2.
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:51.720]  That's the second Guild Wars.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.660]  The equivalent follow-up to Guild Wars.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:56.320]  I did commercials in Guild Wars 1.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.080]  That's the last time I played.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.140]  Oh, did you really?
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:00.160]  Yeah, when it was coming out.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.920]  Only guild I'm in is in Sea of Thieves with you guys.
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:08.400]  Hell yeah.
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.080]  It's true.
[01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:14.400]  I tried to sign up for your guild and then you took the paper away before I could sign it.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:16.240]  And then you had to pull it out again.
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:22.700]  Dude, I love stores.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.120]  Oh my god, I can't get enough stores, guys.
[01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:30.790]  I don't like mushrooms.
[01:47:32.290 --> 01:47:32.990]  You don't?
[01:47:33.230 --> 01:47:33.670]  I'm not a fan.
[01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:35.750]  A strange cat-like creature appears.
[01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:36.770]  Its origin is unknown.
[01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:40.830]  Not a fan as in a food or as a item?
[01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:42.150]  I'm allergic as a food.
[01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:43.810]  I don't mind it as an item in a game.
[01:47:44.210 --> 01:47:45.210]  Oh, you're allergic.
[01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:45.870]  Interesting.
[01:47:47.530 --> 01:47:48.390]  I feel like we should have known that.
[01:47:49.090 --> 01:47:50.870]  Yeah, maybe you just haven't eaten the right mushroom yet.
[01:47:52.330 --> 01:47:55.510]  I should just keep eating mushrooms to find the one I'm not allergic to?
[01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:58.650]  You have to build up a tolerance, you know?
[01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.950]  Exposure therapy.
[01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:04.710]  That looks like AndrewBot.
[01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:06.290]  A little bit, yeah.
[01:48:10.930 --> 01:48:11.650]  Furthering Heights?
[01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:11.910]  What?
[01:48:12.810 --> 01:48:13.610]  Ah, Genshin.
[01:48:14.530 --> 01:48:15.770]  I want to play Splitgate 2.
[01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:16.830]  I hear it's very good.
[01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:19.250]  I think you would like it, Geoff.
[01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:20.390]  It's like Halo combat.
[01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.890]  Let's play it.
[01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:25.610]  It's like Halo mixes with Portal, I think.
[01:48:26.210 --> 01:48:26.790]  Even better.
[01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:27.490]  Try to stop me.
[01:48:27.490 --> 01:48:28.170]  Let's get going.
[01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:29.730]  Let's make a video of it right now.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.840]  I think the Resident Evil guys pissed about this sale.
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:39.480]  He's furious.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.700]  I'm the only one!
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:43.100]  He's throwing his wine all over his office.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:54.160]  So if it's not here, I bet you Resident Evil 9 is at the Xbox showcase on Sunday.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.080]  Yeah, probably.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.240]  Is this a selling point for the Switch 2?
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:01.540]  It is.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.220]  Apparently, it runs really well on it.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:04.980]  Really?
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:10.040]  It's wild to see the Switch 2 cart, that tiny little thing, and then be like,
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.540]  the whole game is on here.
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:14.160]  They're like, there's a day zero update.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.560]  Don't feel like you have to download it.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:15.920]  You don't.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.220]  And it was like, oh, shit.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:17.560]  Wow.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.560]  Into the unwell?
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.740]  I'm really impressed with the Switch 2 so far.
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:26.080]  It looks good.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:26.620]  It feels good.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:31.820]  The controllers, like, taking off the actual Joy-Cons feels so fucking cool.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.000]  Oh.
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:36.160]  Oh, no.
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.540]  That's fucked.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.060]  That's an expensive drink.
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:45.200]  Oh, and he threw it up anyway.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.200]  Been there.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:51.160]  Uh-oh.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:53.720]  Another relapse, huh?
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:58.560]  Get well soon.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.280]  Did he say another relapse?
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:00.920]  Oh, Christ.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:06.000]  It's the Geoff from 2011 to 2018 game.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:15.240]  Maybe it's too much for someone like you.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.820]  So it's cup-headed about addiction?
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:19.900]  Yeah.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:20.800]  Pizza!
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.240]  Hot dogs again!
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.040]  Geoff!
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:26.500]  You might have a lawsuit against this game.
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:32.540]  You'll be shocked to find out that these were all Rooster Teeth fans that made this game.
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.640]  What are your thoughts on eggplant?
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:37.680]  Oh, no, Teeth!
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:38.620]  It is everything!
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:39.640]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.620]  This game is everything that's you.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:42.380]  Oh, no.
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:48.840]  That's okay.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:51.520]  I got all kinds of new issues that nobody even knows about yet.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:53.840]  They can't steal them.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:54.540]  Hey, look!
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:57.720]  Stand there.
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:58.320]  Hey, guys.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.700]  I'm Ian Prue, the co-founder of 1047 Games.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.300]  Hey, thanks for dressing up.
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:04.960]  Dumb fucking hat, by the way.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:05.920]  Thanks for being here.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.060]  Dumbest hat.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:11.580]  That's one of the stupider hats I've ever seen in my life.
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.280]  I'm like, dude, I'm gonna go up there.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.040]  I'm gonna make like a fucking statement, dude.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:16.720]  Like, it's gonna be so sick.
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:20.080]  And just a room full of people going, okay, CEO.
[01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:20.900]  Thanks, man.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:24.540]  Way to put your good pants on, buddy.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:25.500]  Yeah.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:29.140]  I'm gonna make people think about what they don't want to think about.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.240]  And I'm not gonna make a statement at all.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:34.300]  Only the finest velcro for me, sir.
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:38.260]  My biggest issue is I don't think FPS was ever bad as a job.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.060]  Like, there's not...
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:46.260]  Wearing the aura ring while doing this too is like, dude, this is like so fucking hacky.
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.180]  It's fucking awesome.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:47.760]  You suck.
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.900]  Speaking of hacking, he's biohacking right now.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.600]  It's so easy to be a CEO.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:52.640]  Jesus Christ.
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:54.380]  Yeah, they're the worst.
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:57.300]  Who's our CEO?
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:51:58.340]  It's Eric, right?
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.640]  No, I'm the president.
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:02.060]  Unfortunately, no, no.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.460]  Altogether, different title.
[01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:05.620]  Altogether, I think we make up the CEO.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:06.580]  Sweet.
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:07.200]  Yep.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:09.880]  So just a quarter of each of us is bad.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.820]  It's like the worst Voltron.
[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:12.620]  Yep.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:15.820]  Is this Splitgate?
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:16.980]  Yeah.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:18.780]  I hear I might like this game.
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:19.540]  We should play it.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:22.460]  I read, like, I was so high on it.
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:23.180]  And then that guy.
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:27.860]  I'm going to need to weakly forget that that person exists, and then I'll be back in.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.640]  Give it 15 minutes.
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:30.020]  You'll be all right.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:34.240]  I'm going to buy you that make FPS great again hat.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.080]  I would rather wear the red boots than the make FPS great again hat.
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.500]  Oh, God, yes, absolutely.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.960]  Wow, Nick, you must be feeling pretty lucky right about now.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:46.980]  What's going on?
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:47.180]  What?
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:51.620]  High five.
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:52.900]  I love the high five.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:54.740]  How many players is it, Andrew?
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.740]  Uh, I don't know.
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:52:58.520]  It's quite a few.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:52:59.980]  It's a team shooter.
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.460]  We could do like five of us.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:02.640]  Possibly.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.220]  It's definitely at least four.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:05.860]  Yeah, it looks like four.
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:08.900]  It doesn't look like four.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:09.740]  Yeah, I'm going to say it's four.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.680]  So we can play it while Gavin's not around.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:13.680]  Which is whatever.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.120]  Oh, look, it's like Portal.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:17.560]  I heard it's like Portal a little bit.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.000]  I gotta be honest, the song choice is pretty poor.
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.260]  Oh, you know what we gotta play?
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:28.100]  In all seriousness?
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:33.860]  They're fucking bringing Grip Ball back to Halo Infinite or they're bringing it next week.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:34.560]  Yeah, I heard about that.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:35.080]  We gotta do that.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.120]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.000]  People keep asking me if I'm going to play it.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:41.300]  Are you?
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:43.220]  I mean, if we film it, I will.
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:44.780]  If not, then no.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.400]  I think I uninstalled Halo yesterday, actually.
[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:49.360]  Oh, I just installed it.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:51.780]  Oh, you uninstalled it.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.500]  I'm just trying to make Call of Duty work for the damn anymore.
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:58.560]  Is it still giving you lag problems?
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:00.080]  I haven't tried since I reinstalled it.
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:00.760]  Okay, okay.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.320]  And you didn't have those issues when we did Sea of Thieves?
[01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:06.600]  No, no issues in the game.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.140]  Just Call of Duty.
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:09.260]  That's really weird.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.780]  Could have been an update issue, maybe.
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:13.280]  Yeah.
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:16.300]  That game has a lot of freaking updates.
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:20.320]  Oh, this looks cool.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:26.120]  Okay, I feel like I've seen the trailer for this once before, but not this.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:27.460]  Is this like another trailer?
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:30.060]  Well, it's been around since 1943, so the chances are pretty fucking high.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.180]  It's like a 1940s Yakuza?
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.080]  I think so.
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:36.420]  What a cool idea.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:41.460]  This is brave.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:41.960]  Oh, wow.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:45.180]  I mean, 1943, very interesting time here.
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:49.140]  Yeah.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:51.160]  What a way to block him all the time.
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.160]  Just take it.
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:53.680]  Yeah.
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:55.180]  Oh, goodbye.
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.340]  Show him no mercy.
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.200]  Be funny if they're taking a piss.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.320]  I think it is Yakuza.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.640]  Be cool if they brought back true crime.
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:21.260]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:28.940]  Project Century.
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:32.180]  Stranger than Heaven.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:36.940]  Okay, very cool.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.700]  That might be the coolest looking thing I've seen so far.
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:46.040]  You saw it at TGA last year as Project Century set in 1915, and now the full name has been
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:50.320]  revealed, Stranger than Heaven, the brand new title from RGG Studio.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:56.720]  This time it's now 1943, and knowing RGG, I'm sure more surprises are surely on their way.
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:04.020]  All right, well, we're almost done here, but we do have one final very special global game.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:04.980]  What do you guys think it's going to be?
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:06.340]  With all of you who've been waiting.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.120]  Resident Evil.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:11.640]  Today we've showcased a lot of projects from teams around the world, including many brand
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:13.160]  new studios, and we're proud of that.
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.660]  He did say that we'd reveal more in a blink of an eye.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.820]  It would be really funny if this is the blink.
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.360]  Blockbuster games time and again.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:21.580]  Oh, it's probably Garfield.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:23.060]  When I first got a glimpse at this project.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:23.680]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:26.200]  I was absolutely blown away.
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:31.180]  By the scale, scope and ambition of this developer's vision.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:36.000]  And while there are many places, really any place this game could have been revealed,
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:42.800]  we are so deeply honored that we get to share it with the world right here at Summer Game Fest.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:45.160]  Lose your suit, Larry.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.660]  Bubsy 4.
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:47.960]  Control 2.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:49.580]  New Call of Duty.
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:53.660]  That guy.
[01:56:58.190 --> 01:56:59.830]  The Office, the video game.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:00.890]  Yeah.
[01:57:05.110 --> 01:57:07.950]  This could be Resident Evil.
[01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:09.670]  Could be.
[01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.670]  Very.
[01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:11.970]  That font was very Resident Evil.
[01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.710]  Yeah, that everything.
[01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:15.570]  This is entry.
[01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:19.730]  Oh, somebody said equalizer.
[01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.910]  That'd be cool.
[01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:29.110]  Big room.
[01:57:29.710 --> 01:57:30.350]  It's not Jill.
[01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:34.830]  Ashcroft.
[01:57:35.150 --> 01:57:37.750]  Ashcroft is a Resident Evil name, isn't it?
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.000]  Grace Ashcroft.
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:00.600]  Is that the kid in Resident Evil, Grace?
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:04.180]  No, that was...
[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:05.540]  No, that's, um...
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:09.140]  Alyssa or Alicia, Alicia, Alicia.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.940]  Can't remember her name.
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:20.860]  Oh, Rose was that character's name.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:21.260]  Rose.
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:21.920]  Yeah.
[01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:25.600]  And then there was Sherry from...
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:26.620]  Nathan Dempsey.
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:50.080]  It's wild that you misremembered the name as Alyssa and that's the mom name.
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:52.120]  Silent Hills.
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:53.400]  Silent Hill?
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:53.920]  Is that what the chat is saying?
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:55.160]  No, I don't know.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:56.940]  The chat's saying a lot of shit.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.160]  They also say it's X-Files.
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:02.000]  You don't read the chat.
[01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:02.620]  Don't go crazy.
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:09.660]  Is it not Resident Evil?
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:12.200]  It feels like it.
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.640]  Reminds me a bit of P.T.
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:20.400]  Oh, somebody said shit, shit, shit.
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.480]  I'm not familiar with that one.
[01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.910]  Oh.
[01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:32.630]  All right, that doesn't tell me...
[01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:45.210]  Oh, it is.
[01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:46.110]  It's Resident Evil.
[01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.950]  Yeah, because this is...
[01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:47.110]  Yeah.
[01:59:47.630 --> 01:59:48.450]  Yeah, because it's a new...
[01:59:48.450 --> 01:59:49.170]  They dropped the bomb.
[01:59:49.530 --> 01:59:49.690]  Yeah.
[01:59:50.110 --> 01:59:50.350]  Raccoon City.
[01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:53.810]  Whoa.
[01:59:57.810 --> 01:59:59.510]  I wonder if this is first or third.
[02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.950]  Requiem.
[02:00:05.850 --> 02:00:06.290]  Okay.
[02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:08.270]  Fuck yeah.
[02:00:10.050 --> 02:00:10.490]  Finally.
[02:00:13.570 --> 02:00:13.890]  Because...
[02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:14.890]  Wow, I hate everything.
[02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:17.530]  Whoa, that's relatively soon.
[02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:18.690]  Yeah, did they say February?
[02:00:19.170 --> 02:00:19.350]  Yeah.
[02:00:19.770 --> 02:00:19.970]  Yeah.
[02:00:21.730 --> 02:00:22.610]  Oh, awesome.
[02:00:22.670 --> 02:00:23.430]  I'm so excited.
[02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:25.290]  I love Resident Evil 7 and 8.
[02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:27.070]  Really, all the modern ones.
[02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:27.090]  I like this.
[02:00:27.450 --> 02:00:31.390]  It'd be cool if they did a crossover of Resident Evil and Requiem for a dream, the movie.
[02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:31.890]  I don't know.
[02:00:31.890 --> 02:00:31.910]  I don't know.
[02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:33.410]  That would be cool.
[02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:37.650]  You're like busting on Keith David.
[02:00:49.610 --> 02:00:50.230]  Awesome.
[02:00:57.610 --> 02:00:59.570]  You did, because we were mad.
[02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:05.450]  Yeah, way to go, Lucy.
[02:01:06.330 --> 02:01:06.930]  Good work.
[02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:09.430]  It's a daunting thing to go out there in front of those people.
[02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:10.270]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:11.190]  A hundred percent.
[02:01:13.410 --> 02:01:14.930]  Oh, I thought they both did a good job.
[02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:16.230]  Yeah.
[02:01:23.190 --> 02:01:27.210]  They're a good duo, because she's a left-hand person and he's using the right a lot.
[02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.430]  Balance.
[02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:34.230]  They should be on each other's other sides, though.
[02:01:45.630 --> 02:01:46.590]  No problem.
[02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.890]  Cool.
[02:01:53.650 --> 02:01:54.370]  That's awesome.
[02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:56.050]  Almost 6.01.
[02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.630]  Way to go.
[02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:58.290]  Oh, you missed...
[02:01:58.290 --> 02:01:59.650]  Oh, HeroFire showed up late.
[02:01:59.690 --> 02:02:00.770]  You missed the stardew news.
[02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:01.430]  That was pretty crazy.
[02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:04.390]  Yeah, but everyone keep it from them.
[02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:05.130]  They don't need to know about that.
[02:02:05.190 --> 02:02:06.030]  They can figure out themselves.
[02:02:08.610 --> 02:02:12.050]  Well, guys, thanks for watching.
[02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:13.270]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:13.810 --> 02:02:15.830]  A fun summer game fest.
[02:02:15.930 --> 02:02:17.230]  We saw more than one game.
[02:02:19.650 --> 02:02:20.930]  That got really loud.
[02:02:21.450 --> 02:02:24.730]  We saw more than one game, but not to be outdone,
[02:02:25.810 --> 02:02:28.190]  some of the games were not very good, but some of them were okay.
[02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:31.070]  Ending with Resident Evil 9, I thought was very cool.
[02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:32.590]  Great way to end it.
[02:02:33.170 --> 02:02:36.710]  The reason I remembered that name is because Garrett from Mega64
[02:02:36.710 --> 02:02:39.010]  plays Resident Evil Outbreak all the time still,
[02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:42.810]  and he was talking about Alyssa Ashcroft the other day to me.
[02:02:42.850 --> 02:02:43.230]  Oh, wow.
[02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:45.570]  As my eyes glazed over.
[02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:49.010]  But, guys, we made it.
[02:02:49.050 --> 02:02:50.850]  Just about 6.01 here.
[02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:55.070]  The best time of the week because we're calling it.
[02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:55.750]  We're ending it.
[02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:57.530]  And we appreciate you guys sticking with us.
[02:02:57.730 --> 02:02:58.730]  Don't forget to check out the podcast.
[02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:00.230]  Check out the Patreon.
[02:03:00.230 --> 02:03:02.410]  We have a lot of new stuff coming out.
[02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:05.210]  A lot of fun stuff coming out for you guys really soon.
[02:03:05.730 --> 02:03:08.810]  We have a draft coming this Sunday.
[02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:11.590]  If you're listening to this on Tuesday, then you missed it.
[02:03:11.650 --> 02:03:14.070]  It was a couple of days ago, but it's on YouTube, and that'll be free for everyone.
[02:03:14.130 --> 02:03:14.950]  So go check it out.
[02:03:15.630 --> 02:03:17.990]  But until then, this has been Summer Game Fest.
[02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:19.270]  Guys, what was your favorite game?
[02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:23.590]  James Bond DLC or Pitman DLC of James Bond.
[02:03:26.590 --> 02:03:27.950]  Yeah, Resident Evil, I guess.
[02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:30.850]  Mine's Seven Deadly Sins Origin.
[02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:33.510]  Guys, thank you so much for watching, and we'll see you next time.
[02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:33.890]  Bye!
[02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:38.490]  Congratulations to the Mountain Time people who got to experience a true 5.01 today.
[02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:39.570]  It's true, hell yeah.
