[00:00.000 --> 00:04.760]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay. Gavin, we're going to play split fiction.
[00:05.180 --> 00:06.300]  The boys are away.
[00:08.660 --> 00:10.780]  The boys are away, so it's just you and I.
[00:10.860 --> 00:13.100]  We're also the boys. We're the here boys.
[00:13.300 --> 00:17.320]  We're part of the boys. We're two of the five boys.
[00:17.680 --> 00:18.560]  Of team boys.
[00:19.360 --> 00:23.160]  And very rarely, unfortunately, Gracie on occasion.
[00:23.620 --> 00:24.440]  Hasn't been around in a while.
[00:25.080 --> 00:26.480]  I miss Gracie.
[00:26.780 --> 00:29.100]  I miss Gracie too. Gracie is incredible.
[00:29.100 --> 00:30.820]  What a freak. The British Jackal.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.940]  She's still my Slack profile picture.
[00:36.300 --> 00:36.720]  Yeah.
[00:39.200 --> 00:41.580]  I'm happy whenever there's like a world event.
[00:41.800 --> 00:43.120]  Because I Slack Gracie.
[00:43.280 --> 00:45.040]  I'm like, hey, happy whatever this is.
[00:45.360 --> 00:47.420]  It gives me reason to message Gracie.
[00:49.560 --> 00:50.780]  Oh shit, there's plot.
[00:51.820 --> 00:52.480]  There is plot.
[00:55.700 --> 00:57.060]  Do you know anything about this game?
[00:57.980 --> 01:01.640]  No, I just know that Michael and Alfredo were playing it.
[01:03.340 --> 01:04.380]  It is a co-op game.
[01:05.020 --> 01:08.380]  I almost called him Mikey because of Mikey, Alfredo, whatever.
[01:08.840 --> 01:10.340]  Yeah, they're the branding of their channel.
[01:10.560 --> 01:12.720]  But I don't think I've ever called him Mikey in real life.
[01:15.420 --> 01:17.460]  Yeah, you don't strike me as a Mikey guy.
[01:17.780 --> 01:18.180]  In general.
[01:18.900 --> 01:20.720]  I mean, I feel like I would be if he came up to me.
[01:21.440 --> 01:23.640]  In 2012 and said, hey, it's Mikey.
[01:23.860 --> 01:24.660]  I don't call him Mikey.
[01:24.660 --> 01:26.860]  That's not bad.
[01:30.520 --> 01:31.940]  You've been published, Gavin.
[01:32.560 --> 01:34.160]  Oh, that's true.
[01:36.720 --> 01:38.160]  It's easy.
[01:38.580 --> 01:40.360]  Why are all these writers struggling?
[01:40.780 --> 01:42.940]  Just self-publish on Amazon.
[01:44.400 --> 01:45.860]  And make $40.
[01:46.580 --> 01:47.740]  All you need to do.
[01:54.200 --> 01:54.680]  Wow.
[01:56.060 --> 01:57.020]  I wonder...
[01:57.020 --> 02:00.760]  What country has the worst currency ratio for $40?
[02:01.840 --> 02:03.700]  What is the most amount of money you could get?
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.520]  What currency is that?
[02:05.620 --> 02:06.440]  Where would it be the most?
[02:07.600 --> 02:10.720]  I feel like the Yen was doing dog shit recently.
[02:11.660 --> 02:11.980]  Really?
[02:20.080 --> 02:20.400]  Yeah.
[02:20.920 --> 02:25.420]  I feel like...
[02:26.540 --> 02:27.820]  Those roles were flipped there.
[02:27.920 --> 02:29.760]  Because it was the British person doing the small talk.
[02:29.780 --> 02:31.160]  And the American person who didn't want it.
[02:32.040 --> 02:32.420]  Uh-huh.
[02:32.640 --> 02:33.760]  I feel like that would be flipped.
[02:35.220 --> 02:36.800]  In your experience, that's how it goes?
[02:37.300 --> 02:38.880]  Unless it was small talk about the weather.
[02:39.060 --> 02:39.840]  And then it would be the Brit.
[02:42.880 --> 02:45.160]  The toad in the hole is going to be very short-lived.
[02:45.160 --> 02:46.680]  There's going to be a lot of quick rotations.
[02:47.140 --> 02:47.980]  Could be.
[02:49.900 --> 02:54.040]  Oh, maybe there should be some sort of small talk ranker.
[02:58.800 --> 03:01.660]  Like the best subjects the small talk on?
[03:02.200 --> 03:03.980]  Have like 10 small talks for people.
[03:04.100 --> 03:04.660]  And then rank them.
[03:05.900 --> 03:06.360]  Oh.
[03:06.920 --> 03:10.060]  But then I feel like it's almost quality of the talk.
[03:10.180 --> 03:13.340]  I feel like the person heavily influences the quality of the small talk.
[03:15.160 --> 03:18.780]  In a weird way, you're just ranking how much you enjoy talking to each person.
[03:18.920 --> 03:20.280]  And not so much the subject I think.
[03:34.940 --> 03:37.380]  I love the next chapter of storytelling as an idea.
[03:37.420 --> 03:41.840]  But I'm also okay if you just show me a game with Donkey Kong breaking all of the ground.
[03:42.260 --> 03:43.060]  I'm good with that.
[03:43.060 --> 03:45.260]  I don't necessarily need a lot of story.
[03:45.580 --> 03:49.200]  Just give me a big ape that can destroy the terrain and I'm in.
[03:49.500 --> 03:53.160]  Big ape make big shit into lots of tiny little shit.
[03:55.520 --> 04:01.600]  I got so excited by that game trailer that I started playing Donkey Kong Country for the first time.
[04:01.720 --> 04:02.760]  That's how I spent my weekend.
[04:03.880 --> 04:05.200]  Finishing Donkey Kong Country.
[04:05.400 --> 04:06.660]  I had never played it before.
[04:06.880 --> 04:07.540]  On Super Nintendo?
[04:08.580 --> 04:10.060]  Yeah, the SNES version.
[04:10.060 --> 04:10.740]  Hell yeah.
[04:11.820 --> 04:14.140]  I could see at the time people being like,
[04:14.300 --> 04:16.860]  Oh my god, this is lifelike.
[04:17.860 --> 04:20.360]  I was blown away by how it looked.
[04:20.600 --> 04:23.020]  They used CG renders for the sprites.
[04:23.340 --> 04:26.020]  They rendered them in 3D and then put them back into 2D.
[04:26.720 --> 04:27.200]  Revolutionary.
[04:27.860 --> 04:28.980]  It was really cool looking.
[04:30.380 --> 04:34.600]  I could so clearly see myself being a child at the time that release.
[04:34.740 --> 04:37.460]  Just going, oh, this is wizardry.
[04:37.700 --> 04:38.580]  This doesn't make sense.
[04:38.580 --> 04:40.200]  And I think at the time,
[04:40.700 --> 04:42.080]  the computer, the silicon
[04:43.280 --> 04:44.860]  imaging computer that did that
[04:44.860 --> 04:45.860]  or something, whatever it's called,
[04:46.260 --> 04:48.200]  cost like a quarter of a million pounds.
[04:49.180 --> 04:49.620]  Wow.
[04:50.060 --> 04:51.180]  Just to render those out.
[04:53.540 --> 04:54.580]  So I finished that
[04:54.580 --> 04:56.760]  and I'm now on Donkey Kong Country 2.
[04:57.560 --> 04:58.720]  Just working through.
[04:59.220 --> 05:00.220]  It's nice because the Switch,
[05:00.300 --> 05:02.220]  if you have the premium online or whatever,
[05:02.340 --> 05:04.180]  you have the back catalog of all those things.
[05:04.340 --> 05:04.540]  Yeah.
[05:09.700 --> 05:11.600]  I want to get that GameCube controller
[05:11.600 --> 05:13.420]  for the Switch, too, but I just know that thing
[05:13.420 --> 05:15.100]  is going to be impossible to get
[05:15.100 --> 05:16.140]  when it first comes out.
[05:16.580 --> 05:17.500]  Yeah, I need one.
[05:20.260 --> 05:21.940]  I've got 3D All-Stars,
[05:22.020 --> 05:23.520]  which is that Mario game
[05:23.520 --> 05:24.780]  that was sold briefly.
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.540]  That's Mario 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy.
[05:29.560 --> 05:30.240]  Oh, jeez.
[05:30.420 --> 05:33.020]  I don't want to play them on the wrong controllers.
[05:33.240 --> 05:34.800]  So I bought the N64 controller.
[05:36.780 --> 05:38.200]  Well, clearly, I should be the Brit.
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.320]  I'm taking the Brit.
[05:40.460 --> 05:41.100]  You took the Brit?
[05:41.740 --> 05:42.820]  I'm taking the Brit.
[05:44.660 --> 05:45.320]  In it!
[05:46.700 --> 05:47.800]  In it, weather it.
[05:47.840 --> 05:48.720]  The weather in it.
[05:50.020 --> 05:50.720]  Natural fit.
[05:51.320 --> 05:53.400]  That was a more accurate Brit than what I've been doing.
[05:57.080 --> 05:57.960]  Sorry, you were saying
[05:57.960 --> 05:59.900]  you wanted the right controllers to play it.
[05:59.920 --> 06:01.580]  You haven't played it because you don't have a GameCube controller?
[06:01.880 --> 06:03.380]  Yeah, but for some reason, I thought Sunshine
[06:03.380 --> 06:05.100]  was also on the N64, and I was like,
[06:05.200 --> 06:06.380]  oh, it's on the GameCube.
[06:06.660 --> 06:09.860]  Not only one of those games
[06:09.860 --> 06:11.020]  is on the N64.
[06:11.480 --> 06:11.720]  Yeah.
[06:12.440 --> 06:14.680]  Well, I think the Galaxy was on the Wii, wasn't it?
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.720]  So they're all on different consoles.
[06:16.620 --> 06:18.580]  Oh, was it Wii? Yeah, I guess it would be.
[06:20.380 --> 06:21.520]  I was just not
[06:22.360 --> 06:23.480]  into Mario at that time.
[06:24.660 --> 06:25.640]  I was in 64
[06:25.640 --> 06:26.740]  and then I never played
[06:27.320 --> 06:28.460]  the other ones for some reason.
[06:28.640 --> 06:30.180]  I went from 64 to Odyssey.
[06:30.180 --> 06:31.220]  It was a hell of a leap.
[06:33.900 --> 06:36.240]  I feel like I must have beaten 64,
[06:36.480 --> 06:38.040]  but I feel like it was one of those games
[06:38.040 --> 06:40.240]  where I had the cartridge
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.100]  for it, and family would come over,
[06:42.320 --> 06:44.000]  and everyone would play it, and I just
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.040]  don't know what I did as opposed to
[06:46.040 --> 06:48.860]  what the community save file was.
[06:50.640 --> 06:52.440]  I have definite memories
[06:52.440 --> 06:54.220]  of the first level, and also I have
[06:54.220 --> 06:56.260]  memories of facing Bowser at some point,
[06:56.280 --> 06:58.280]  but zero of the
[06:58.280 --> 07:00.320]  in-between those things, which makes me think I did
[07:00.320 --> 07:02.360]  not get the Bowser. That's so funny as well.
[07:02.940 --> 07:04.280]  Sharing that game, because some
[07:04.280 --> 07:06.340]  stars are like, you walk into the level, you run
[07:06.340 --> 07:08.320]  up a hill, and you get the star. And some of them are like,
[07:08.480 --> 07:10.260]  collect eight things across the
[07:10.260 --> 07:12.460]  entire map. They'll take completely different amounts
[07:12.460 --> 07:13.200]  of time. Yeah.
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.680]  We're like all up in each other's stories.
[07:23.700 --> 07:24.420]  We are, yeah.
[07:31.830 --> 07:33.350]  Oh shit, this is your story?
[07:33.450 --> 07:34.270]  Yeah, my story.
[07:39.370 --> 07:40.290]  Is this what
[07:40.290 --> 07:41.990]  Celestial Glorbosis looks like?
[07:42.690 --> 07:44.630]  Oh shit, I should read this book.
[07:45.290 --> 07:46.050]  Oh no,
[07:46.350 --> 07:47.090]  Global X!
[07:51.190 --> 07:56.210]  Damn, we got strong
[07:56.210 --> 07:58.390]  knees. Oh, yeah, well
[07:58.390 --> 07:59.610]  it's the suits.
[08:00.970 --> 08:02.230]  Also we're in fictional
[08:02.230 --> 08:04.130]  land, so it works. It's fine.
[08:05.530 --> 08:06.470]  So it's a
[08:06.470 --> 08:08.090]  split between our fictions.
[08:09.290 --> 08:11.370]  Yeah, the title is all making sense.
[08:13.730 --> 08:15.270]  There needs to be a moment where a character
[08:15.270 --> 08:17.550]  looks at the screen and slowly puts it together.
[08:17.910 --> 08:18.790]  And then winks.
[08:18.950 --> 08:21.330]  It's almost like we split fiction.
[08:23.470 --> 08:24.270]  Here we go, gameplay.
[08:25.290 --> 08:26.950]  Oh, it's split screen even though I...
[08:26.950 --> 08:28.070]  It's split screen.
[08:30.670 --> 08:31.170]  I'm right.
[08:31.710 --> 08:32.790]  I'm on the right side.
[08:33.030 --> 08:33.350]  I'm on the left.
[08:37.710 --> 08:38.150]  Alright,
[08:38.390 --> 08:39.310]  all I know is that
[08:39.310 --> 08:41.290]  we have to do this faster than Mikey and Frady.
[08:42.130 --> 08:43.010]  Okay, easy.
[08:43.190 --> 08:44.490]  We got this. Oh shit!
[08:44.810 --> 08:46.930]  Did you play It Takes Two or any of these
[08:46.930 --> 08:48.050]  other games that they made?
[08:49.170 --> 08:50.870]  I played some of It Takes Two.
[08:51.670 --> 08:53.150]  I didn't finish it.
[08:53.730 --> 08:54.230]  It's a long game.
[08:54.890 --> 08:55.450]  I don't blame you.
[08:56.470 --> 08:57.210]  It's a long game?
[08:57.970 --> 08:59.690]  Yeah, it really
[08:59.690 --> 09:02.470]  goes on. In my opinion, it goes on
[09:02.470 --> 09:03.750]  longer than it probably should have.
[09:04.050 --> 09:05.070]  Oh shit!
[09:06.350 --> 09:08.270]  Dude, the game knew I was Trash Talk in their
[09:08.270 --> 09:09.590]  previous entry and they fucking
[09:09.590 --> 09:11.250]  lit me up.
[09:15.020 --> 09:15.460]  Okay.
[09:20.320 --> 09:27.470]  Yeah, It Takes Two, I feel like the game bit
[09:27.470 --> 09:28.610]  was good, but
[09:29.290 --> 09:30.990]  they just should shut up and let us play.
[09:31.830 --> 09:32.990]  Yeah, the story is
[09:32.990 --> 09:35.230]  definitely not the strongest point
[09:35.230 --> 09:36.190]  of that game.
[09:36.370 --> 09:37.750]  Did you play A Way Out?
[09:38.850 --> 09:39.210]  Yes.
[09:40.850 --> 09:42.130]  That went on a while as well.
[09:43.310 --> 09:44.050]  It did.
[09:47.790 --> 09:48.930]  Oh, do you think we'll get to
[09:48.930 --> 09:49.770]  murder each other at the end?
[09:50.850 --> 09:52.530]  Oh, that would be fun.
[09:55.550 --> 09:56.950]  Maybe we get married,
[09:57.090 --> 09:59.010]  don't get a divorce, and don't
[09:59.010 --> 10:00.890]  kill each other in the end so it's the reverse of
[10:00.890 --> 10:01.590]  all the games.
[10:02.890 --> 10:04.590]  Is it counting death?
[10:05.110 --> 10:06.650]  Is it just we both have to not die?
[10:07.970 --> 10:08.490]  Uh...
[10:08.490 --> 10:10.910]  I assume? You dying a lot?
[10:11.210 --> 10:13.030]  Yeah, I was trying to jump dash
[10:13.030 --> 10:13.950]  instead of just dash.
[10:16.010 --> 10:18.950]  No, I guess we're in like a tutorial mode
[10:18.950 --> 10:20.830]  where it's just like, hey, dodge
[10:20.830 --> 10:21.350]  these things.
[10:23.130 --> 10:23.650]  Whoa!
[10:25.270 --> 10:26.310]  Oh shit!
[10:26.310 --> 10:26.490]  Oh shit!
[10:32.600 --> 10:35.280]  Okay, jump. Double jump.
[10:35.620 --> 10:39.760]  Oh, that ain't good.
[10:43.650 --> 10:44.550]  Fuck me!
[10:48.750 --> 10:50.190]  Okay, you should have been this character.
[10:50.330 --> 10:51.030]  I know. I'm sorry.
[10:52.810 --> 10:54.630]  You should have taken this from me.
[10:57.730 --> 10:59.030]  Gonna go for the overtake.
[11:00.770 --> 11:02.170]  You think you could run across
[11:02.170 --> 11:03.830]  a beam like this in real life without falling?
[11:04.150 --> 11:06.270]  Oh shit! No, I would be dead.
[11:06.710 --> 11:11.510]  Oh, forgiving checkpoint.
[11:13.250 --> 11:14.410]  Very forgiving checkpoint.
[11:16.230 --> 11:18.110]  We're used to GTA 5 heist
[11:18.110 --> 11:19.850]  checkpoints which are not nearly as forgiving.
[11:20.250 --> 11:21.410]  I'm stuck! Help!
[11:22.270 --> 11:23.090]  What? Help!
[11:24.370 --> 11:26.290]  Help! Let's go around!
[11:27.210 --> 11:28.230]  Oh, you did it!
[11:28.230 --> 11:29.310]  I got stuck down there.
[11:29.910 --> 11:31.430]  Oh, you're on the beam!
[11:32.070 --> 11:34.170]  That's funny. I was like, why aren't you
[11:34.170 --> 11:35.190]  just stepping to your left?
[11:35.830 --> 11:36.990]  Let's go around!
[11:41.530 --> 11:46.030]  Alright, pulling.
[11:46.390 --> 11:47.070]  Alright, on three!
[11:48.110 --> 11:49.610]  Nope! Nope! Nope!
[11:50.390 --> 11:52.170]  Okay! Wait!
[11:53.750 --> 11:54.790]  Hold! Go!
[11:56.150 --> 11:56.710]  Woo!
[11:57.730 --> 11:58.290]  Whoops.
[12:00.130 --> 12:01.290]  Oh, is it easier now?
[12:01.490 --> 12:01.750]  No!
[12:03.770 --> 12:05.350]  Gotta beat Mikey Fredo!
[12:05.710 --> 12:06.470]  Oh wow!
[12:07.350 --> 12:08.530]  On my screen, you should have died.
[12:16.110 --> 12:18.270]  We're split in fiction.
[12:25.060 --> 12:27.160]  What would be like the funniest combination
[12:27.160 --> 12:29.140]  of like directors
[12:29.140 --> 12:31.180]  or like actors
[12:31.180 --> 12:32.760]  for what they're known for?
[12:33.360 --> 12:34.240]  They're splitting fiction.
[12:35.640 --> 12:37.340]  I'm thinking like Wes Anderson.
[12:37.680 --> 12:39.340]  Wes Anderson has to be one
[12:39.340 --> 12:41.000]  because this is going to be so different.
[12:42.760 --> 12:43.240]  Yeah, like a
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.700]  Wes Anderson, Michael Bay.
[12:46.040 --> 12:46.300]  Yo!
[12:47.920 --> 12:48.960]  That'd be great.
[12:51.300 --> 12:53.040]  I was thinking like Wes Anderson,
[12:53.340 --> 12:54.340]  Steven Seagal.
[12:56.020 --> 12:57.420]  What about Michael Bay?
[12:57.420 --> 12:58.820]  I don't know what Steven Seagal would do.
[12:59.300 --> 13:00.660]  Barney the Dinosaur. Oh no!
[13:03.120 --> 13:05.380]  You want Michael Bay to do Barney?
[13:05.500 --> 13:07.240]  Is that what you said? Yeah, it'd be a weird combo.
[13:08.020 --> 13:09.140]  It would be a weird combo.
[13:14.240 --> 13:15.260]  Eject ship, okay.
[13:16.280 --> 13:17.420]  Oh, do we both control?
[13:19.700 --> 13:20.180]  Oh, okay.
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.960]  Yeah, I think you're...
[13:23.960 --> 13:25.800]  I don't...
[13:26.840 --> 13:27.480]  There we go.
[13:28.660 --> 13:29.440]  Yeah, I was just
[13:29.440 --> 13:29.880]  mashing it.
[13:30.060 --> 13:33.920]  You think that would...
[13:33.920 --> 13:35.500]  Do we hack it or do we just
[13:35.500 --> 13:36.760]  use it the way it was intended?
[13:37.660 --> 13:38.640]  I don't know.
[13:42.880 --> 13:43.580]  Enjoying the view?
[13:44.520 --> 13:44.960]  Oh!
[13:45.700 --> 13:46.660]  Oh shit!
[13:52.740 --> 13:53.700]  Oh no!
[13:54.420 --> 13:55.160]  Did you go down?
[13:56.180 --> 13:57.300]  Yeah, I was down in the middle.
[13:59.540 --> 14:00.660]  Wait, okay.
[14:02.860 --> 14:04.040]  It's all water.
[14:15.160 --> 14:17.100]  Imagine if when you swam in real life
[14:17.100 --> 14:19.140]  the only way to go up or down is to think A
[14:19.140 --> 14:19.800]  or B.
[14:26.930 --> 14:27.490]  Shortcut!
[14:29.150 --> 14:29.710]  Shortcut!
[14:30.650 --> 14:32.250]  Are you a big swim guy?
[14:33.450 --> 14:34.670]  I love a swim.
[14:35.350 --> 14:36.290]  I'm a big water guy.
[14:36.290 --> 14:36.350]  Okay.
[14:38.470 --> 14:40.090]  Not so much anymore, but
[14:40.090 --> 14:41.290]  I used to live
[14:42.030 --> 14:44.190]  in a place that was like, you could walk
[14:44.190 --> 14:45.970]  to a beach type area.
[14:46.170 --> 14:46.830]  So I would go up.
[14:47.630 --> 14:48.110]  Oh!
[14:54.160 --> 14:54.920]  What about you?
[14:55.700 --> 14:56.180]  Love it.
[14:59.000 --> 14:59.820]  Loves a swim.
[14:59.980 --> 15:01.860]  Were you ever in a position where you had easy access
[15:01.860 --> 15:03.220]  to something, like walking distance?
[15:05.080 --> 15:06.040]  I do now.
[15:07.620 --> 15:08.260]  That's good.
[15:18.300 --> 15:20.140]  I've never used an actual
[15:20.140 --> 15:22.360]  gun, but I feel like I could because of video games.
[15:23.120 --> 15:24.080]  I feel like I get it.
[15:24.180 --> 15:24.560]  It's pretty similar.
[15:25.520 --> 15:27.700]  Pull the thing back, there's a safety.
[15:28.360 --> 15:28.620]  Yeah.
[15:33.460 --> 15:38.780]  Oh, shit!
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.600]  It's all on you, Gavin!
[15:41.140 --> 15:41.760]  Get him!
[15:43.320 --> 15:44.700]  Come here! Oh, shit!
[15:45.940 --> 15:46.540]  Secure it!
[15:47.320 --> 15:48.760]  I believe in you!
[15:50.300 --> 15:50.980]  Yeah!
[15:52.120 --> 15:52.980]  Get out!
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.680]  Fuck you!
[16:00.660 --> 16:01.800]  Oh my god!
[16:07.180 --> 16:08.360]  Flying gun!
[16:09.840 --> 16:10.600]  Am I steering?
[16:12.060 --> 16:13.020]  Yeah, I think you're the pilot.
[16:13.640 --> 16:14.480]  Oh, hell yeah!
[16:15.180 --> 16:16.080]  I'm shooting you.
[16:18.500 --> 16:19.180]  Oh, shit!
[16:19.660 --> 16:20.020]  Get out of here!
[16:20.220 --> 16:20.740]  Get out of here!
[16:28.780 --> 16:29.780]  What was that?
[16:30.400 --> 16:32.220]  I didn't know that was the non-purpose.
[16:32.880 --> 16:34.080]  I thought we were supposed to do that.
[16:35.180 --> 16:36.380]  This might take me a while.
[16:37.240 --> 16:37.820]  Yeah, that's okay.
[16:41.740 --> 16:42.120]  Ow.
[16:51.400 --> 16:53.280]  It's so slow, the turret is so slow!
[16:57.640 --> 16:58.440]  Good flying!
[16:59.820 --> 17:00.720]  What was that?
[17:00.720 --> 17:03.240]  That was my fault, we got gunned down.
[17:05.220 --> 17:06.740]  It's tough to whip this thing around.
[17:06.920 --> 17:09.260]  Yeah, it looks like a big lump of a gun.
[17:10.040 --> 17:11.100]  Yeah, it's pretty slow.
[17:11.940 --> 17:13.020]  I'm on top of it.
[17:13.740 --> 17:14.720]  I'm ready this time.
[17:22.810 --> 17:23.430]  Fuck.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.260]  Am I going under this?
[17:29.460 --> 17:30.220]  Fuck off, fuck off.
[17:30.680 --> 17:31.960]  And now we go under.
[17:33.060 --> 17:34.180]  Okay, and that one got got.
[17:35.140 --> 17:36.020]  Through the window.
[17:39.910 --> 17:40.530]  Yeah!
[17:42.290 --> 17:43.290]  Oh, no!
[17:45.850 --> 17:46.830]  In it!
[18:04.920 --> 18:11.700]  Oh, yeah.
[18:11.700 --> 18:12.780]  Oh, now we're in the other story.
[18:12.780 --> 18:14.540]  Now this is more like it.
[18:21.620 --> 18:23.260]  What if it was half what we just did,
[18:23.300 --> 18:25.480]  and then half just actual Skyrim?
[18:28.040 --> 18:29.080]  That'd be pretty good.
[18:33.280 --> 18:35.200]  You know how, like, in the Master Chief collection,
[18:35.320 --> 18:37.160]  you hit a button and you can go to new graphics
[18:37.160 --> 18:38.540]  to, like, old graphics?
[18:38.760 --> 18:40.660]  It's that, but you hit the button
[18:40.660 --> 18:42.060]  and you go from Halo to Skyrim.
[18:42.300 --> 18:42.800]  Whatever you want.
[18:44.520 --> 18:47.460]  But your movement in one game affects where you are in the other game.
[18:47.460 --> 18:48.580]  Yes!
[18:51.760 --> 18:53.240]  I'd play the shit out of that.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.540]  I never played Skyrim.
[18:59.680 --> 19:01.820]  Holy shit, I've played it probably three times.
[19:04.980 --> 19:05.600]  Trolls?
[19:09.400 --> 19:10.840]  Trolls in a dungeon!
[19:16.680 --> 19:18.600]  Oh, shit!
[19:18.720 --> 19:18.860]  What?
[19:24.600 --> 19:25.560]  Donkey Kong!
[19:26.620 --> 19:28.540]  You've trained for this.
[19:30.700 --> 19:31.180]  No!
[19:33.080 --> 19:35.500]  Wait, I'm just dead.
[19:36.260 --> 19:36.780]  And now I'm back.
[19:40.560 --> 19:42.020]  You double jump.
[19:46.580 --> 19:47.540]  That's bullshit.
[19:50.520 --> 19:52.620]  That's some hot-footed trolls!
[19:58.340 --> 20:00.000]  Are you sweating?
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.140]  Shrek has changed a lot over the years.
[20:03.000 --> 20:04.240]  What has changed a lot?
[20:04.880 --> 20:05.420]  Shrek.
[20:10.210 --> 20:10.970]  Uh-oh, think G.
[20:11.730 --> 20:12.230]  No!
[20:12.230 --> 20:12.510]  Oh!
[20:14.870 --> 20:22.580]  Ah, but we're small enough to fit through that.
[20:25.120 --> 20:26.080]  Holy shit.
[20:31.170 --> 20:32.210]  There we go, we're fine.
[20:34.090 --> 20:36.250]  Obviously no ogre could get through that.
[20:36.990 --> 20:37.790]  Troll, whatever.
[20:38.510 --> 20:40.290]  What's the difference between an ogre and a troll?
[20:42.110 --> 20:43.430]  Are they the same?
[20:43.430 --> 20:45.110]  I got ground up in the windmill.
[20:46.290 --> 20:48.030]  I assume they're the same.
[20:48.090 --> 20:48.930]  You got winded.
[20:49.650 --> 20:51.430]  I got milled.
[20:52.850 --> 20:55.110]  Oh, you got ground up in the windmill.
[21:01.250 --> 21:04.310]  I assume it's almost certainly a water mill.
[21:07.290 --> 21:09.030]  Oh, Assassin's Creed!
[21:09.030 --> 21:10.050]  Assassin's Creed!
[21:10.670 --> 21:11.930]  Gavin, you gotta get up here.
[21:11.970 --> 21:13.850]  You got Assassin's Creed, I'm waiting for you.
[21:14.010 --> 21:16.110]  I keep not pressing dash.
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.080]  There you go.
[21:21.180 --> 21:21.640]  No!
[21:24.680 --> 21:25.700]  Go, go, go!
[21:28.620 --> 21:28.920]  Yeah!
[21:32.140 --> 21:33.520]  Watch Assassin's Creed.
[21:33.940 --> 21:38.060]  Oh, that looked great.
[21:38.060 --> 21:39.180]  In real life.
[21:40.980 --> 21:42.040]  It'd be great.
[21:42.220 --> 21:43.160]  Would you do it?
[21:44.460 --> 21:47.100]  If it wouldn't break my back, definitely.
[21:47.420 --> 21:47.940]  Oh, shit.
[21:50.540 --> 21:51.420]  Yeah, I would.
[21:51.640 --> 21:51.920]  Absolutely.
[21:53.860 --> 21:55.760]  Don't think that's how that's supposed to work.
[21:57.020 --> 21:57.940]  Can I dash?
[21:59.380 --> 22:01.760]  I can distract him.
[22:01.920 --> 22:02.040]  Ready?
[22:03.840 --> 22:04.400]  Go.
[22:04.400 --> 22:05.540]  No, the other way.
[22:05.820 --> 22:06.940]  You go the other way.
[22:07.480 --> 22:14.700]  Oh, that was bullshit!
[22:15.960 --> 22:16.440]  Okay, he spun.
[22:17.480 --> 22:18.180]  Okay, check this out.
[22:21.820 --> 22:22.520]  Okay, nice.
[22:23.860 --> 22:24.620]  I think we're good.
[22:24.760 --> 22:25.460]  I think we can just go.
[22:25.800 --> 22:26.780]  Do you not have anything else to throw?
[22:28.520 --> 22:28.880]  No.
[22:28.880 --> 22:29.440]  Okay.
[22:39.740 --> 22:40.620]  Oh, boy.
[22:40.860 --> 22:41.300]  Okay.
[22:42.960 --> 22:44.120]  No, no, no.
[22:46.920 --> 22:47.740]  You're going that way?
[22:47.800 --> 22:48.540]  I'll go right.
[22:49.420 --> 22:51.420]  Why did I get off it?
[22:55.440 --> 22:56.940]  I just gotta be patient.
[22:57.040 --> 22:57.560]  I gotta wait.
[22:58.160 --> 22:59.580]  Oh, shit, it's starting to shake.
[22:59.580 --> 23:01.580]  Oh, shit.
[23:04.220 --> 23:05.560]  Catch it up.
[23:06.840 --> 23:07.980]  Be there in a sec.
[23:11.920 --> 23:13.260]  Push them lemons.
[23:23.460 --> 23:24.500]  Super jump.
[23:28.950 --> 23:31.110]  I think that was my favorite glitch of all time.
[23:31.230 --> 23:32.550]  I love super jumping in Halo 2.
[23:33.610 --> 23:35.450]  I remember I got one by accident once.
[23:36.690 --> 23:38.410]  That would be insane.
[23:38.410 --> 23:40.190]  We suck, apparently.
[23:42.550 --> 23:45.150]  I'm gonna dash. Let's get all the speed I can get.
[23:48.670 --> 23:50.390]  Oh, that's a fast bastard.
[23:53.030 --> 23:58.510]  Gavin, you gotta hurry up.
[23:58.610 --> 23:59.370]  He's right on you.
[24:03.970 --> 24:04.830]  Oh, shit.
[24:05.090 --> 24:06.630]  Who ruined so many trolls?
[24:06.830 --> 24:07.150]  Oh, no.
[24:10.930 --> 24:11.430]  What is that?
[24:14.310 --> 24:16.150]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[24:18.110 --> 24:18.870]  The glitch!
[24:20.930 --> 24:22.150]  Why was it all the way up there?
[24:24.390 --> 24:25.910]  You can't control glitches.
[24:26.070 --> 24:27.150]  They'll show up where they want to.
[24:28.270 --> 24:40.690]  What is this place?
[24:43.390 --> 24:46.910]  Whatever it is, I think the glitch has something to do with it.
[24:46.930 --> 24:48.570]  This is the inside of Notch's brain.
[24:49.670 --> 24:50.910]  Just cubes.
[25:02.690 --> 25:03.910]  How do I know?
[25:06.130 --> 25:07.810]  It'd be really weird if you did.
[25:08.930 --> 25:10.250]  Well, that's clearly
[25:10.250 --> 25:12.150]  a glitch anomaly
[25:12.150 --> 25:14.370]  commonly found in modern tech
[25:14.370 --> 25:15.210]  of this design.
[25:15.550 --> 25:17.910]  I wish we could pick dialogue.
[25:20.910 --> 25:21.530]  Oh.
[25:24.290 --> 25:26.330]  There's a point where the player gets to
[25:26.330 --> 25:27.030]  just say what they want.
[25:27.050 --> 25:29.710]  Yeah, you say what's going on, and I can pick from four things.
[25:30.030 --> 25:32.090]  And I can pick how shitty I want to be in response.
[25:34.090 --> 25:34.450]  Interesting.
[25:41.930 --> 25:43.330]  I mean, I guess...
[25:43.330 --> 25:45.290]  Never mind.
[25:46.010 --> 25:46.630]  I hate it.
[25:47.610 --> 25:49.150]  I was going to say there's probably a way to do it,
[25:49.210 --> 25:51.670]  but all the ways I could see it being done
[25:51.670 --> 25:54.170]  are ways I would hate as far as the practice of it goes.
[26:03.490 --> 26:03.850]  Oh.
[26:03.950 --> 26:05.150]  Oh, let's stop bickering, shall we?
[26:05.190 --> 26:06.170]  And start jumping and shit.
[26:18.690 --> 26:19.050]  What?
[26:19.050 --> 26:19.250]  What?
[26:23.270 --> 26:25.090]  It'd be interesting if you could play
[26:25.090 --> 26:27.110]  a game where you had to reserve a time
[26:27.110 --> 26:28.930]  to play it because all the other characters
[26:28.930 --> 26:30.110]  were voiced by real people.
[26:31.130 --> 26:32.810]  But you had to, like, get the whole team together.
[26:33.750 --> 26:34.730]  Yeah, like, it was
[26:34.730 --> 26:36.570]  super expensive, and it was like
[26:36.570 --> 26:38.630]  you show up, you have to schedule
[26:38.630 --> 26:41.030]  months, if not a year in advance.
[26:41.730 --> 26:42.990]  I always thought that'd be fun to do
[26:42.990 --> 26:45.350]  in a campaign. Like, imagine if...
[26:45.350 --> 26:46.230]  Like, say you beat
[26:48.110 --> 26:48.990]  950 enemies
[26:48.990 --> 26:50.570]  in Halo, and they all have to be
[26:50.570 --> 26:52.170]  controlled by different people.
[26:55.930 --> 26:57.790]  That would actually be really cool.
[26:57.990 --> 26:59.990]  You're just, like, one grunt in one hallway
[26:59.990 --> 27:01.970]  on level four, so you're just chilling
[27:01.970 --> 27:03.210]  for, like, the first three hours.
[27:19.740 --> 27:21.720]  Do people feel that way? In real life?
[27:21.820 --> 27:22.380]  About genres?
[27:23.040 --> 27:25.660]  I really don't care what genre a thing is.
[27:26.020 --> 27:28.020]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not a genre snob.
[27:33.020 --> 27:34.340]  Actually, I am with music.
[27:35.680 --> 27:36.920]  Music, yeah, definitely
[27:36.920 --> 27:39.000]  people are genre snobs, but
[27:39.560 --> 27:40.700]  for, like, general
[27:40.700 --> 27:41.240]  fiction,
[27:42.340 --> 27:44.060]  I feel like it's weird to be
[27:45.080 --> 27:46.680]  so against any
[27:46.680 --> 27:47.540]  specific genre.
[27:48.200 --> 27:50.060]  I'm against fantasy non-fiction.
[28:02.380 --> 28:03.360]  Oh, you get
[28:03.360 --> 28:04.200]  the gravity whip?
[28:05.540 --> 28:06.800]  You have a katana.
[28:07.040 --> 28:07.680]  Pretty cool.
[28:09.360 --> 28:11.160]  Yeah, I can start slitting.
[28:22.060 --> 28:22.740]  Okay.
[28:27.780 --> 28:29.280]  Get these glitches!
[28:31.940 --> 28:32.360]  Oh, shit!
[28:34.080 --> 28:34.820]  Oh, yours is cooler.
[28:35.260 --> 28:36.420]  Yours is way cooler.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.140]  Well, I mean,
[28:38.180 --> 28:39.840]  I couldn't do that.
[28:41.860 --> 28:42.600]  You could lift
[28:42.600 --> 28:43.860]  the damn door up.
[28:45.600 --> 28:46.640]  Is that cool?
[28:47.800 --> 28:48.600]  Okay, you can
[28:48.600 --> 28:50.220]  shift gravity. That's pretty cool.
[28:50.440 --> 28:52.060]  That's pretty cool. I'll take that.
[28:55.790 --> 28:56.390]  What am I doing with this?
[28:56.470 --> 28:58.170]  You gotta cut it
[28:58.170 --> 28:58.890]  so I can have a rope.
[28:58.890 --> 28:59.830]  Thank you.
[29:01.710 --> 29:02.630]  Okay, that's...
[29:02.630 --> 29:04.630]  This is disorientating.
[29:06.530 --> 29:06.990]  Nope.
[29:07.930 --> 29:09.850]  I probably should've waited for your boss.
[29:10.690 --> 29:11.410]  Drag me!
[29:14.170 --> 29:14.630]  Well...
[29:14.630 --> 29:15.150]  Okay.
[29:15.910 --> 29:16.850]  Do I need to jump this?
[29:18.810 --> 29:20.110]  I think I just gotta...
[29:20.110 --> 29:21.210]  I don't know what I'm supposed to...
[29:21.210 --> 29:22.250]  I'll just jump over it.
[29:23.190 --> 29:24.930]  Oh, is it coming back?
[29:26.330 --> 29:27.170]  Oh, no!
[29:27.170 --> 29:30.430]  It was like the last moment
[29:30.430 --> 29:31.090]  it could get you.
[29:31.150 --> 29:34.010]  I started looking behind.
[29:35.030 --> 29:35.670]  Okay.
[29:37.070 --> 29:38.090]  Bring him back.
[29:39.330 --> 29:40.330]  Alright, let's do this.
[29:44.290 --> 29:44.930]  Nice.
[29:50.800 --> 30:00.920]  Oh, shit.
[30:01.580 --> 30:02.620]  It's acid floor.
[30:02.780 --> 30:03.680]  No, it's flubber.
[30:08.070 --> 30:08.790]  Shared gravity.
[30:09.810 --> 30:10.490]  Oh, there we go.
[30:13.450 --> 30:14.250]  Oh, Roomba!
[30:15.510 --> 30:15.870]  Ow!
[30:16.430 --> 30:18.210]  I'm sorry, I didn't know I could hit you.
[30:19.510 --> 30:21.290]  Alright, pull the cover off and I'll twat it.
[30:22.250 --> 30:23.290]  Bap, bap, bap.
[30:25.150 --> 30:25.510]  Ow!
[30:25.710 --> 30:27.490]  Oh, I'm so sorry, I need to stop hitting you.
[30:27.490 --> 30:28.250]  Nice.
[30:30.730 --> 30:31.330]  No!
[30:33.010 --> 30:34.730]  The slash makes you step forwards.
[30:35.050 --> 30:35.590]  That's misleading.
[30:38.370 --> 30:39.770]  Check this out.
[30:42.230 --> 30:43.250]  Holy shit.
[30:44.110 --> 30:44.750]  That was cool.
[30:45.810 --> 30:46.010]  Oh!
[30:46.270 --> 30:49.330]  Oh, I need to...
[30:49.330 --> 30:51.050]  Okay, could you...
[30:51.050 --> 30:51.730]  Oh, I need to open it again.
[30:53.210 --> 30:53.810]  Bam!
[31:00.870 --> 31:01.110]  Oops!
[31:01.810 --> 31:03.010]  We're figuring it out.
[31:06.650 --> 31:07.930]  I need to break these.
[31:14.160 --> 31:14.560]  Nice.
[31:16.760 --> 31:17.580]  I'll go break these.
[31:18.780 --> 31:20.160]  Is it going to fall on me?
[31:20.860 --> 31:21.080]  No.
[31:21.500 --> 31:22.040]  Thank you.
[31:23.300 --> 31:23.900]  Thank you.
[31:28.010 --> 31:28.410]  Alright.
[31:30.130 --> 31:32.890]  Thank you, I want to make sure to use every one you bring down for me.
[31:32.970 --> 31:33.710]  Thank you, thank you.
[31:33.710 --> 31:34.830]  I only needed three, I guess.
[31:36.150 --> 31:37.010]  Are we going to be
[31:37.010 --> 31:39.550]  on opposite sides of this in this tiny tunnel?
[31:39.670 --> 31:40.470]  We're going to rub heads.
[31:41.390 --> 31:42.350]  Oh, head rub.
[31:43.390 --> 31:44.830]  Oh, it's like Spider-Man.
[31:47.610 --> 31:49.170]  It's like Spider-Man.
[31:53.670 --> 31:55.550]  Now we're back. Now we're level.
[31:57.910 --> 31:59.210]  Oh shit, I fell in a hole.
[31:59.650 --> 32:00.090]  Okay.
[32:07.010 --> 32:09.650]  And then...
[32:09.650 --> 32:10.390]  Perfect.
[32:12.410 --> 32:14.990]  How would that door be used by normal people?
[32:17.530 --> 32:18.990]  I have no idea.
[32:20.230 --> 32:20.830]  Oh, it's like that
[32:20.830 --> 32:22.630]  truck running game. What's that game called?
[32:23.430 --> 32:24.290]  Truck Runner.
[32:24.790 --> 32:25.130]  Oh yeah.
[32:27.130 --> 32:28.270]  I have no idea.
[32:29.550 --> 32:29.910]  Ah!
[32:31.790 --> 32:32.150]  Oh!
[32:34.990 --> 32:35.990]  I left, maybe?
[32:36.170 --> 32:37.990]  Oh shit, it gets closer!
[32:38.230 --> 32:39.530]  Oh wow, interesting.
[32:40.710 --> 32:42.670]  Okay, I stand on it and I just gotta wait.
[32:43.290 --> 32:44.210]  Yeah, that's all about
[32:45.490 --> 32:46.130]  timing and that.
[32:46.150 --> 32:47.210]  A little bit more patience.
[32:49.370 --> 32:50.350]  What's going on over there
[32:50.350 --> 32:50.670]  for you?
[32:52.290 --> 32:54.070]  Do that, and then I'm going to do this.
[32:55.610 --> 32:55.970]  Ah!
[32:59.130 --> 33:00.290]  Where am I going to go to
[33:00.290 --> 33:00.770]  from here?
[33:02.130 --> 33:03.170]  Oh, from underneath.
[33:13.350 --> 33:13.670]  Piang!
[33:15.150 --> 33:16.510]  Oh, what we got going on over here?
[33:16.590 --> 33:17.590]  You gotta go to the other...
[33:18.250 --> 33:20.030]  You gotta open the door, I think, and I gotta
[33:20.030 --> 33:20.850]  gravity on it.
[33:22.790 --> 33:23.690]  It's open, isn't it?
[33:24.510 --> 33:25.350]  You gotta pull it off.
[33:27.570 --> 33:28.270]  What do you mean?
[33:28.930 --> 33:29.850]  Can I just do it from here?
[33:32.610 --> 33:34.430]  It just looks like there's glass in front of it.
[33:34.910 --> 33:35.890]  Do I have to hit this again?
[33:37.070 --> 33:38.110]  Oh, you launched me!
[33:38.930 --> 33:39.290]  Oh, okay.
[33:43.230 --> 33:43.950]  Boing! Yeah!
[33:44.470 --> 33:46.470]  Okay, now they're here. Here we go.
[33:46.610 --> 33:47.410]  There we go!
[33:51.630 --> 33:51.990]  Nice!
[33:56.010 --> 33:57.850]  Well, now where the goddamn am I supposed to go?
[33:58.770 --> 34:00.470]  Are you doing the crane?
[34:00.890 --> 34:02.730]  Yep, I'm moving the crane for you.
[34:02.890 --> 34:06.950]  Oh! Whoa!
[34:07.810 --> 34:08.530]  What?
[34:09.970 --> 34:11.030]  I'm stuck!
[34:12.090 --> 34:13.130]  Are you dead?
[34:13.430 --> 34:15.030]  I'm smushed!
[34:18.070 --> 34:19.510]  Nice recovery!
[34:19.850 --> 34:20.450]  Holy shit!
[34:22.830 --> 34:24.070]  Oh, there's a man!
[34:26.550 --> 34:27.170]  Uh...
[34:28.010 --> 34:29.530]  Oh, you're steering!
[34:30.730 --> 34:32.150]  I need you to get over here!
[34:33.530 --> 34:34.430]  Thank you!
[34:36.310 --> 34:36.930]  Yeah!
[34:41.230 --> 34:41.850]  Uh...
[34:41.850 --> 34:43.490]  Can you get me...
[34:43.490 --> 34:44.450]  Oh, this is probably fine.
[34:45.250 --> 34:47.430]  Nope! Nope, I couldn't!
[34:49.250 --> 34:50.210]  Shit, okay.
[34:50.210 --> 34:50.310]  Okay.
[34:52.090 --> 34:53.510]  Climbing up the truck!
[34:57.650 --> 34:59.230]  Thank you for lining that up.
[34:59.310 --> 35:00.270]  Oh, that's so much easier.
[35:03.710 --> 35:05.030]  Now where am I going?
[35:06.050 --> 35:06.970]  Do this.
[35:10.230 --> 35:12.130]  Oh, it's like a flubber tank.
[35:16.430 --> 35:16.890]  Uh...
[35:16.890 --> 35:18.790]  Is there anything I'm supposed to do?
[35:18.790 --> 35:20.210]  No? Okay, I can't leave now.
[35:24.170 --> 35:24.570]  Shit.
[35:27.550 --> 35:28.410]  I gotta wait.
[35:29.770 --> 35:30.950]  I don't know, uh...
[35:30.950 --> 35:32.770]  if I can do anything else for you at this point.
[35:32.870 --> 35:33.770]  I think...
[35:33.770 --> 35:36.890]  It's alright, I'm just chillin'. It's Sunday drivin'.
[35:36.890 --> 35:38.770]  Look at that.
[35:41.530 --> 35:41.930]  Okay.
[35:42.930 --> 35:44.110]  I think I need you now.
[35:47.800 --> 35:48.760]  Oh, I could have been
[35:48.760 --> 35:50.100]  moving that whole time.
[35:51.200 --> 35:52.560]  I think you gotta adjust.
[35:54.900 --> 35:56.640]  I think you're supposed to line it up.
[36:04.700 --> 36:05.900]  There you go.
[36:09.020 --> 36:09.920]  Now it's your turn
[36:09.920 --> 36:10.660]  to make the jumps.
[36:13.120 --> 36:14.120]  Gavi-goo!
[36:15.000 --> 36:15.940]  Gavi avoiding
[36:15.940 --> 36:16.380]  the goo.
[36:18.400 --> 36:20.040]  Wow, you did so good!
[36:20.040 --> 36:20.920]  Great job!
[36:24.290 --> 36:25.790]  Oh, look at these idiots.
[36:26.330 --> 36:26.870]  Losers.
[36:27.670 --> 36:29.030]  I'm in your butt.
[36:32.190 --> 36:33.270]  Uh... okay.
[36:34.530 --> 36:35.930]  Oops! Oops! Oops!
[36:36.310 --> 36:37.170]  Oops! Oops!
[36:39.450 --> 36:41.570]  I don't know how I keep doing these saves.
[36:41.630 --> 36:42.070]  Oh, thank you.
[36:42.310 --> 36:44.410]  Good job!
[36:44.930 --> 36:47.970]  The fact that my gravity is different
[36:48.750 --> 36:49.290]  is...
[36:49.290 --> 36:51.450]  It's just I'm climbing a ladder, but much harder
[36:51.450 --> 36:52.630]  than normal.
[36:55.050 --> 36:55.670]  Ooh.
[36:57.270 --> 36:58.290]  Woo-hoo-hoo!
[36:58.730 --> 36:59.830]  Good lord.
[37:01.790 --> 37:02.070]  Okay.
[37:02.910 --> 37:03.730]  Hey, there you are.
[37:04.630 --> 37:04.890]  Hey!
[37:08.670 --> 37:09.290]  Ah!
[37:10.550 --> 37:11.610]  Oh, you okay?
[37:12.490 --> 37:13.110]  Missed.
[37:20.520 --> 37:20.830]  Shit!
[37:20.830 --> 37:20.910]  Shit!
[37:25.400 --> 37:26.300]  Ooh, damn.
[37:26.500 --> 37:28.000]  Oh, no! Sorry, truck!
[37:34.150 --> 37:34.450]  Woo!
[37:36.930 --> 37:37.530]  Oh!
[37:38.430 --> 37:39.290]  Here we go.
[37:40.430 --> 37:42.750]  Oh, it's a city versus country trope.
[37:43.290 --> 37:44.170]  Ah, yes.
[37:48.700 --> 37:49.780]  Stars are overrated.
[37:50.820 --> 37:52.180]  I've always seen it.
[37:53.160 --> 37:54.800]  Now that would make for some great
[37:54.800 --> 37:55.420]  small talk.
[37:56.080 --> 37:57.660]  Are stars properly
[37:57.660 --> 37:58.060]  rated?
[38:04.140 --> 38:05.480]  Let's just kill him.
[38:06.360 --> 38:07.580]  Cut the car in half.
[38:12.400 --> 38:14.460]  That's right where my handle is for my
[38:14.460 --> 38:15.140]  sword, though.
[38:22.800 --> 38:24.340]  If I was telling
[38:24.340 --> 38:25.800]  someone with a sword
[38:26.340 --> 38:28.080]  to surrender, I'd say put your hands
[38:28.080 --> 38:29.500]  really far down.
[38:32.940 --> 38:34.400]  I need those
[38:34.400 --> 38:36.120]  hands at the 5 o'clock
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.420]  and like the 7 o'clock position
[38:38.420 --> 38:38.860]  please.
[38:42.460 --> 38:43.400]  Oh, shit.
[38:43.900 --> 38:44.960]  Okay. Grapple attack!
[38:45.520 --> 38:46.100]  Oh, shit!
[38:52.470 --> 38:53.370]  I'm whipping him!
[38:53.510 --> 38:54.010]  I'm whipping him!
[38:55.910 --> 38:56.790]  Holy shit!
[38:58.950 --> 38:59.890]  I can throw him!
[39:05.240 --> 39:06.020]  Get out of here!
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.000]  Just like screaming in my ears.
[39:08.420 --> 39:09.220]  Get out of here!
[39:09.220 --> 39:09.300]  Get out of here!
[39:12.500 --> 39:15.220]  I think we both...
[39:19.110 --> 39:19.910]  Fuck off!
[39:20.290 --> 39:22.270]  I'm grappling to people that you're pulling
[39:22.270 --> 39:24.210]  so I'm ending up just hovering above the edge.
[39:30.900 --> 39:31.940]  Oh, okay.
[39:32.140 --> 39:33.000]  You gotta pull forward.
[39:35.380 --> 39:36.600]  Oh, shit. Gun turret!
[39:39.080 --> 39:39.820]  Oh, shit.
[39:39.940 --> 39:41.700]  I'm throwing the enemies at the turret.
[39:41.700 --> 39:42.300]  Oh, shit.
[39:45.800 --> 39:47.500]  Get over here.
[39:53.080 --> 39:54.080]  Pulling up.
[39:55.300 --> 39:56.540]  I'm flinging bins!
[39:57.760 --> 39:58.820]  I'm flinging bins!
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.360]  Keep flinging them!
[40:00.720 --> 40:01.960]  Oh, shit. I fell in the bin.
[40:02.960 --> 40:03.340]  Oh, no!
[40:04.760 --> 40:05.460]  Flinging a man!
[40:06.880 --> 40:07.500]  Fling the bins!
[40:07.680 --> 40:08.200]  Fling the bins!
[40:10.580 --> 40:12.160]  Keep flinging the bins!
[40:12.160 --> 40:14.280]  Hold on, I'm coming back.
[40:14.320 --> 40:16.140]  I need the bins to be flung!
[40:16.760 --> 40:17.540]  Flinging bins!
[40:18.500 --> 40:20.340]  Where is it?
[40:20.440 --> 40:21.020]  Where are they?
[40:22.960 --> 40:23.760]  More bins!
[40:24.660 --> 40:25.360]  More bins!
[40:26.420 --> 40:27.220]  Binage!
[40:32.980 --> 40:33.520]  Oh, no!
[40:39.050 --> 40:39.370]  Whoa!
[40:42.450 --> 40:48.090]  Was that really necessary?
[40:48.090 --> 40:48.970]  Yeah.
[40:50.170 --> 40:51.090]  Definitely was.
[40:52.990 --> 40:54.570]  Best part of the game so far.
[40:54.670 --> 40:55.510]  I'd say that's very necessary.
[40:56.630 --> 40:58.350]  You're kind of whiny so far this game.
[41:00.670 --> 41:02.510]  I'm whiny and you're an ass.
[41:14.080 --> 41:14.600]  Portal?
[41:16.820 --> 41:18.540]  We're gonna get to play Portal 3?
[41:21.580 --> 41:23.420]  Isn't that technically a pinball cabinet?
[41:24.000 --> 41:24.620]  Is it?
[41:25.400 --> 41:26.800]  I think the new Portal game
[41:26.800 --> 41:27.640]  is a pinball cabinet.
[41:29.400 --> 41:29.840]  What?
[41:30.140 --> 41:31.540]  I don't know how you don't know that.
[41:31.720 --> 41:34.440]  Either I made that up or it's crazy that you don't know that.
[41:35.840 --> 41:36.660]  That's crazy
[41:36.660 --> 41:37.340]  that I don't know that.
[41:40.500 --> 41:41.320]  Where are we going?
[41:43.060 --> 41:44.900]  We touched the shared globule.
[41:48.060 --> 41:48.500]  Dune!
[41:50.120 --> 41:50.840]  Oh, damn.
[41:50.980 --> 41:51.600]  Bit of midriff.
[42:00.200 --> 42:02.000]  There are certain
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.980]  sentences that are so much less charming
[42:04.980 --> 42:06.040]  without your accent.
[42:09.780 --> 42:12.040]  Your accent is probably the only version
[42:12.040 --> 42:14.560]  where those combination of words sounds funny and playful.
[42:16.920 --> 42:18.860]  It just sounds sleazy otherwise.
[42:19.220 --> 42:21.000]  I feel like it just
[42:21.000 --> 42:21.580]  really doesn't make sense.
[42:21.580 --> 42:23.600]  It really ranges depending on the accent.
[42:27.040 --> 42:29.120]  Do we get worms? Do we get sandworms?
[42:29.180 --> 42:30.560]  Or is this more like Prince Pershing?
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.440]  Give me some time rewinding.
[42:35.160 --> 42:36.500]  Did you play any of the Aladdin games?
[42:37.940 --> 42:38.340]  No.
[42:38.980 --> 42:40.640]  I was a Super Nintendo Aladdin guy.
[42:40.840 --> 42:43.340]  But a lot of people say the Sega Mega Drive
[42:43.340 --> 42:45.180]  version was better. Genesis or whatever.
[42:45.360 --> 42:45.740]  Really?
[42:46.680 --> 42:47.580]  Never played it.
[42:48.480 --> 42:49.220]  Is it
[42:49.220 --> 42:51.840]  like the Lion King where it's insanely difficult?
[42:52.000 --> 42:52.700]  Is it one of those?
[42:54.960 --> 42:55.600]  No, I mean
[42:55.600 --> 42:56.760]  it was doable for me as a kid.
[42:57.320 --> 42:58.960]  The Super Nintendo one.
[43:13.340 --> 43:14.220]  Sand sharks!
[43:19.470 --> 43:20.530]  I missed my sword.
[43:22.010 --> 43:23.350]  Yeah, your sword was pretty cool.
[43:25.230 --> 43:25.590]  Oh.
[43:25.950 --> 43:26.590]  What if I do this?
[43:27.150 --> 43:27.650]  What does this do?
[43:29.090 --> 43:29.450]  Oh.
[43:29.730 --> 43:33.730]  I think you're supposed to...
[43:33.730 --> 43:34.870]  Oh shit.
[43:34.990 --> 43:37.430]  Okay. Keep the attention.
[43:37.570 --> 43:38.170]  Keep the attention.
[43:41.950 --> 43:43.710]  Oh, I made it.
[43:43.830 --> 43:44.550]  Ready?
[43:47.070 --> 43:47.790]  Go.
[43:52.440 --> 43:53.820]  I'm just walking.
[43:53.820 --> 43:54.680]  Should I have been running?
[44:02.520 --> 44:03.200]  Okay.
[44:11.120 --> 44:11.800]  Nice.
[44:12.220 --> 44:12.900]  Let's thump a tub.
[44:14.620 --> 44:15.240]  Great job.
[44:18.820 --> 44:20.100]  Oh hell yeah.
[44:20.100 --> 44:20.600]  Oh yeah.
[44:23.960 --> 44:25.100]  What do we got here?
[44:27.140 --> 44:27.640]  Mash!
[44:32.380 --> 44:33.340]  I've never been a good masher.
[44:34.280 --> 44:36.120]  Oh, good mashers always good.
[44:36.920 --> 44:37.240]  Okay.
[44:37.780 --> 44:38.540]  That could've been bad.
[44:39.820 --> 44:40.320]  Ah!
[44:41.340 --> 44:42.860]  How did you do that?
[44:44.100 --> 44:45.500]  How did you fall there?
[44:45.680 --> 44:46.740]  I don't know. I went through.
[44:49.100 --> 44:50.160]  What were you gonna say?
[44:50.160 --> 44:52.400]  I was gonna say, I think after
[44:52.400 --> 44:54.060]  you know, the betrayal we
[44:54.060 --> 44:56.320]  had of Mario Party
[44:56.960 --> 44:57.500]  March.
[44:57.660 --> 44:59.400]  I think this is a good
[45:00.030 --> 45:01.860]  couples exercise almost to go through.
[45:03.140 --> 45:04.120]  Rebuilding friendship.
[45:04.340 --> 45:05.340]  The betrayal we had.
[45:06.240 --> 45:08.180]  Well, you know, I betrayed you and then
[45:08.180 --> 45:09.720]  you stomped me into the ground.
[45:11.120 --> 45:12.120]  Beyond death.
[45:15.300 --> 45:16.300]  I would say
[45:16.300 --> 45:18.160]  your vengeance is maybe a little heavy
[45:18.160 --> 45:19.960]  handed, although initially
[45:19.960 --> 45:20.440]  fair.
[45:21.780 --> 45:24.140]  It was like if I was playing whack-a-mole, and then I
[45:24.140 --> 45:25.520]  just targeted one mole.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.160]  But that mole was
[45:28.160 --> 45:30.140]  an asshole to you to start with, so you had
[45:30.140 --> 45:32.280]  incentive, but like, maybe you didn't
[45:32.280 --> 45:34.160]  need to give it those nine whacks.
[45:34.320 --> 45:35.840]  Maybe seven would've been adequate.
[45:36.700 --> 45:38.080]  I just wanted to whack it
[45:38.080 --> 45:40.260]  every time it came up for the rest of the game.
[45:42.340 --> 45:43.240]  Ah, shit!
[45:43.860 --> 45:45.700]  Oh, this is doomed.
[45:45.700 --> 45:46.120]  Hell yeah.
[45:47.400 --> 45:47.980]  Dune!
[45:50.240 --> 45:51.640]  I haven't seen either of those movies.
[45:52.100 --> 45:53.140]  You've never seen Dune?
[45:53.760 --> 45:55.000]  I didn't see Dune.
[45:55.200 --> 45:55.820]  Did you see July?
[45:56.840 --> 45:59.400]  I have seen Independence Day.
[46:01.280 --> 46:03.540]  Oh, we should make a top best month
[46:03.540 --> 46:04.440]  movies list.
[46:05.080 --> 46:05.900]  Oh, man.
[46:06.660 --> 46:07.880]  June would obviously be Dune.
[46:10.640 --> 46:12.200]  Why is Dune, Dune?
[46:12.200 --> 46:13.680]  Just because it rhymes?
[46:14.680 --> 46:15.940]  Ah! Uh, yeah.
[46:16.920 --> 46:18.060]  Okay. And just because
[46:18.060 --> 46:19.560]  that's how I say it. Dune.
[46:20.440 --> 46:21.000]  Okay.
[46:22.800 --> 46:23.360]  Woo!
[46:24.940 --> 46:26.280]  I hate this
[46:26.280 --> 46:26.540]  bit.
[46:27.880 --> 46:29.460]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like you're doing well.
[46:35.120 --> 46:35.940]  It's okay.
[46:37.720 --> 46:38.840]  I think...
[46:38.840 --> 46:39.440]  Okay.
[46:39.880 --> 46:41.720]  With how you're
[46:41.720 --> 46:43.920]  playing, that felt very shitty in a way
[46:43.920 --> 46:44.980]  that they did not intend.
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.120]  Sounded real condescending.
[46:47.600 --> 46:48.040]  Ah!
[46:49.580 --> 46:50.740]  You're a natural.
[46:53.580 --> 46:54.380]  There we go.
[46:54.720 --> 46:57.420]  We're out of it. We're back. We're back to the ninjas.
[47:05.640 --> 47:08.860]  Oh, I could so do without these interstitials.
[47:11.840 --> 47:12.280]  Swords!
[47:18.030 --> 47:19.810]  So what was that? A side quest?
[47:20.010 --> 47:21.150]  That didn't do anything for us.
[47:21.150 --> 47:21.870]  Essentially, yeah.
[47:23.030 --> 47:25.210]  Listen, I had a lot of fun riding
[47:25.210 --> 47:27.130]  Sand Sharks. You died over and over again.
[47:27.190 --> 47:29.150]  I get why you feel the way you did, but...
[47:29.150 --> 47:30.630]  That was a good time for me.
[47:40.270 --> 47:40.990]  Side stories.
[47:43.230 --> 47:44.390]  You could have voiced the character.
[47:45.950 --> 47:47.210]  So does that mean that was optional?
[47:48.510 --> 47:49.210]  I think so.
[47:49.210 --> 47:49.470]  Oh.
[47:57.250 --> 48:00.330]  I'm gonna cut your whip up!
[48:01.090 --> 48:01.750]  Ow!
[48:02.150 --> 48:03.350]  You hurt me!
[48:06.090 --> 48:07.250]  Oh, over here.
[48:08.910 --> 48:10.270]  One of them wall things.
[48:15.210 --> 48:16.030]  Oh yeah?
[48:17.850 --> 48:18.930]  I'll kill you!
[48:18.930 --> 48:20.650]  What? No!
[48:22.030 --> 48:24.090]  This looks like I'm lying down.
[48:24.630 --> 48:25.670]  It does, yeah.
[48:31.010 --> 48:32.790]  Can I go this way?
[48:34.810 --> 48:35.490]  Nope!
[48:46.830 --> 48:49.650]  Alright, see ya!
[48:49.990 --> 48:52.170]  Hey, can you throw the...
[48:52.170 --> 48:52.750]  Hey!
[48:53.110 --> 48:55.470]  Can you throw the ball?
[48:57.530 --> 48:57.990]  Four!
[48:59.710 --> 49:01.110]  Hell yeah!
[49:05.720 --> 49:07.770]  Can I whip the glass?
[49:08.290 --> 49:09.390]  Nope. Shit. Okay.
[49:10.030 --> 49:10.530]  Four!
[49:12.830 --> 49:13.310]  Oh!
[49:14.070 --> 49:16.970]  Give me another four!
[49:16.970 --> 49:17.430]  Oh!
[49:20.760 --> 49:21.530]  Double break!
[49:25.080 --> 49:26.340]  Can you get in the hoop?
[49:27.180 --> 49:28.040]  Where's the hoop?
[49:28.440 --> 49:28.900]  Can you score?
[49:32.600 --> 49:34.000]  Hell yeah!
[49:34.360 --> 49:35.040]  Three points!
[49:36.380 --> 49:37.140]  From downtown!
[49:38.420 --> 49:39.760]  Wait, can I...
[49:39.760 --> 49:41.440]  Can I hit it before it hits the ground?
[49:41.840 --> 49:42.640]  Let's see.
[49:45.140 --> 49:45.840]  Ah!
[49:48.900 --> 49:49.800]  Oh no!
[49:51.120 --> 49:52.340]  Well, goddamn!
[49:53.620 --> 49:54.820]  You can do that.
[49:54.920 --> 49:56.100]  I think I just gotta wait for you again.
[49:56.840 --> 49:57.800]  Oh shit, it's Hopscotch.
[49:58.360 --> 49:59.540]  Buh! Buh! Buh!
[50:00.340 --> 50:00.700]  Buh!
[50:04.460 --> 50:04.980]  Nice!
[50:06.400 --> 50:06.920]  Bam!
[50:08.100 --> 50:08.900]  Let me get back.
[50:10.340 --> 50:12.560]  Okay. Ladder.
[50:25.670 --> 50:26.710]  The elephant!
[50:29.010 --> 50:30.290]  From Intakes 2!
[50:31.790 --> 50:32.310]  Oh!
[50:33.010 --> 50:33.850]  Oh shit!
[50:35.090 --> 50:36.210]  What's that, a sack?
[50:37.890 --> 50:38.410]  Shit.
[50:38.510 --> 50:39.510]  I ripped its leg off.
[50:39.850 --> 50:41.370]  Oh, that was the elephant leg?
[50:41.950 --> 50:44.830]  Yeah. What's that, a sack?
[50:45.370 --> 50:46.770]  I didn't see where you got it from.
[50:48.510 --> 50:49.230]  Oh, grind the rail!
[50:50.870 --> 50:51.970]  Oh, can you grind?
[50:52.530 --> 50:54.630]  Yeah. Nah. I did. Oh, I can't.
[50:54.650 --> 50:54.910]  Didn't I?
[50:57.450 --> 50:58.890]  You gotta go back
[50:58.890 --> 50:59.250]  and check.
[51:01.210 --> 51:02.570]  Can I grind this rail?
[51:04.290 --> 51:04.810]  Oh!
[51:05.010 --> 51:05.970]  Oh, I'm just sliding.
[51:08.890 --> 51:10.770]  Oh, you're sliding on the rail.
[51:15.590 --> 51:16.710]  Is there a train in here?
[51:17.690 --> 51:19.050]  I would assume so.
[51:20.730 --> 51:21.190]  Wow!
[51:21.650 --> 51:21.910]  Wow!
[51:22.510 --> 51:25.490]  Go, go, go!
[51:28.390 --> 51:28.830]  Oh!
[51:33.430 --> 51:33.890]  Oh!
[51:35.270 --> 51:35.730]  Oh!
[51:36.770 --> 51:37.110]  Oh!
[51:37.290 --> 51:37.750]  Shit!
[51:40.590 --> 51:41.790]  Oh, Gavin.
[51:42.250 --> 51:42.750]  Oh, Gavin.
[51:43.370 --> 51:43.670]  Ah!
[51:45.510 --> 51:45.970]  Oh!
[51:47.170 --> 51:49.610]  I feel like the game was generous there.
[51:50.010 --> 51:50.590]  Ah!
[51:50.590 --> 51:50.770]  Ah!
[51:56.020 --> 51:57.420]  See, that's what English people say.
[51:57.540 --> 51:58.500]  They say, ready, steady, go.
[52:00.600 --> 52:01.480]  Oh, radio.
[52:01.700 --> 52:02.700]  None of that set shit.
[52:03.200 --> 52:04.160]  Oh, you're tuning the radio?
[52:07.220 --> 52:08.640]  What does the fuck the Oscars say?
[52:12.570 --> 52:14.010]  I just killed that bin.
[52:14.850 --> 52:15.310]  Good job.
[52:15.450 --> 52:15.870]  Watch this.
[52:17.230 --> 52:17.630]  Whoa!
[52:19.050 --> 52:19.850]  Trash everywhere.
[52:20.910 --> 52:21.810]  Can you kill that lock?
[52:23.290 --> 52:24.250]  Pretty big lock.
[52:26.730 --> 52:27.230]  Teamwork.
[52:27.550 --> 52:31.150]  I like if you weren't here, I would've knocked the lock off and just looked at the gate.
[52:31.430 --> 52:32.610]  You would've been stuck forever.
[52:33.630 --> 52:34.730]  You would've thought, now what?
[52:40.950 --> 52:41.450]  Swing!
[52:44.030 --> 52:44.330]  Whoops.
[52:45.950 --> 52:47.550]  I love the lizard king.
[52:59.720 --> 53:00.720]  Ah, bollocks!
[53:07.230 --> 53:08.770]  I can hear yelling.
[53:14.470 --> 53:15.750]  Cyber ninjas.
[53:16.810 --> 53:18.070]  Cyber ninjas,
[53:18.410 --> 53:20.110]  what they gonna cyber next?
[53:20.530 --> 53:21.410]  Oh, I thought I could
[53:21.410 --> 53:23.050]  ride the air up.
[53:24.090 --> 53:25.870]  Go, go, cyber ninjas!
[53:26.650 --> 53:27.850]  Nope, you gotta...
[53:28.450 --> 53:29.050]  Oh, this?
[53:29.690 --> 53:30.090]  Yep.
[53:30.090 --> 53:30.250]  Yep.
[53:33.510 --> 53:35.550]  Money morphing cyber ninjas!
[53:36.390 --> 53:38.390]  Holy shit, the club be bumping!
[53:38.710 --> 53:40.390]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[53:40.890 --> 53:41.690]  Oh, with the act.
[53:42.810 --> 53:43.950]  They better pay us after this.
[53:46.270 --> 53:46.610]  Whoops!
[53:46.650 --> 53:49.110]  Finally some money I can use for a switch too.
[53:50.810 --> 53:51.930]  Why did I die
[53:51.930 --> 53:53.090]  when I fell into the club?
[53:53.390 --> 53:54.230]  Like, what killed me there?
[53:54.450 --> 53:57.370]  Sorry about that.
[53:57.370 --> 53:59.270]  I think I may have done that to you.
[54:05.110 --> 54:06.210]  It's okay, take your time.
[54:06.270 --> 54:06.650]  I don't mind.
[54:16.770 --> 54:17.530]  Judo chop!
[54:19.010 --> 54:19.370]  Yeah!
[54:20.110 --> 54:21.370]  Oh, I hit the wire!
[54:27.230 --> 54:27.670]  Woohoo!
[54:30.350 --> 54:30.770]  Oh no!
[54:31.930 --> 54:32.950]  Oh god, I let go
[54:32.950 --> 54:33.510]  for some reason.
[54:41.660 --> 54:43.260]  It's gotta be a boss fight, right?
[54:43.380 --> 54:46.020]  We just went through the club, the elevator to the...
[54:46.020 --> 54:47.060]  Are we missing something?
[54:48.040 --> 54:48.820]  Oh, Y.
[54:49.380 --> 54:49.980]  Pressing Y.
[54:49.980 --> 54:50.280]  Why?
[55:06.040 --> 55:07.900]  When was the last time you described
[55:07.900 --> 55:08.840]  somebody as a gem?
[55:10.100 --> 55:11.660]  Ooh, a few years?
[55:13.340 --> 55:13.660]  You gotta,
[55:13.800 --> 55:15.120]  you gotta make sure to do that.
[55:15.660 --> 55:17.420]  Who's gonna be 2025's gem?
[55:19.680 --> 55:20.800]  Gem of 25?
[55:26.610 --> 55:26.750]  Ha!
[55:27.270 --> 55:29.330]  I would believe that Smee dragged us in.
[55:30.910 --> 55:31.610]  Smee dragged
[55:31.610 --> 55:32.910]  my sock into my office.
[55:34.830 --> 55:35.610]  Did you say
[55:35.610 --> 55:36.850]  look what the cat dragged in?
[55:38.710 --> 55:39.390]  I should.
[55:39.790 --> 55:41.290]  But I think talking to my socks
[55:41.290 --> 55:42.870]  when I'm alone is a bit of a low point.
[55:43.550 --> 55:45.070]  I thought you'd be talking to Smee.
[55:45.570 --> 55:46.630]  But I guess it'd be weird.
[55:46.630 --> 55:48.410]  Oh, I'm saying
[55:48.410 --> 55:49.970]  look what the cat dragged into the cat.
[55:50.090 --> 55:51.130]  To the cat, yeah.
[55:51.490 --> 55:52.430]  That's a good point.
[55:55.390 --> 55:55.870]  Juggernaut!
[55:58.950 --> 56:00.410]  That was an expensive
[56:00.410 --> 56:01.170]  railing!
[56:08.150 --> 56:09.110]  Good boy.
[56:10.230 --> 56:12.110]  I think the older I get, the more
[56:12.110 --> 56:14.090]  I think that boss fights are the worst part
[56:14.090 --> 56:15.850]  of every game. Really?
[56:16.130 --> 56:18.330]  Yeah. Are you not like a
[56:19.090 --> 56:20.170]  Dark Souls or like
[56:20.170 --> 56:21.730]  Sekiro guy? Nah.
[56:22.550 --> 56:24.210]  Yeah. That's fair, I guess
[56:24.210 --> 56:25.090]  if you don't like boss fights.
[56:25.990 --> 56:27.190]  Are you a big boss guy?
[56:28.590 --> 56:30.130]  There are some good boss fights.
[56:30.390 --> 56:31.590]  You need to hit this, I think.
[56:31.690 --> 56:33.270]  It's purple or pink or whatever.
[56:35.810 --> 56:37.910]  Oh, you're dead. That explains why
[56:37.910 --> 56:38.990]  it's not being hit.
[56:41.510 --> 56:42.050]  Woohoohoo!
[56:45.270 --> 56:45.810]  Alright.
[56:46.150 --> 56:46.970]  Now he's gonna throw
[56:46.970 --> 56:47.890]  more.
[56:49.730 --> 56:50.630]  Hammer down!
[56:52.210 --> 56:52.630]  Ow.
[56:56.130 --> 56:57.310]  Oh, thank you!
[56:58.970 --> 56:59.870]  Oh, fuck!
[56:59.970 --> 57:00.430]  Oh, let's get him!
[57:00.750 --> 57:01.890]  Get him! Get him! Get him!
[57:02.150 --> 57:03.790]  Eat shit! Get slit!
[57:04.170 --> 57:05.090]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop!
[57:07.090 --> 57:08.310]  Woo! Woo!
[57:09.630 --> 57:10.590]  Woo! Woo!
[57:11.390 --> 57:13.510]  He's got tornado skills now!
[57:15.130 --> 57:16.110]  Oh, get away!
[57:19.710 --> 57:20.870]  He's just dancing!
[57:21.650 --> 57:23.870]  I was just watching him go after you, then he turned.
[57:25.490 --> 57:26.030]  Oh!
[57:27.450 --> 57:28.790]  False hammer down!
[57:29.750 --> 57:31.030]  Oh, the second one was faster!
[57:33.850 --> 57:34.770]  Come here, hammer bastard!
[57:36.730 --> 57:37.670]  Go! No!
[57:37.670 --> 57:38.470]  Go!
[57:39.390 --> 57:41.770]  I'm mashing, I'm mashing, I'm mashing! I'm trying to get it, I'm trying to get it!
[57:42.390 --> 57:42.990]  Got it!
[57:44.110 --> 57:44.690]  Got him!
[57:45.870 --> 57:46.550]  Fuck you!
[57:48.750 --> 57:50.190]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop!
[57:51.330 --> 57:51.990]  Halfway done.
[57:52.650 --> 57:53.110]  Woo!
[57:56.430 --> 57:56.890]  Ah.
[57:57.290 --> 57:58.630]  I love when Heat's referenced.
[58:00.610 --> 58:01.050]  Heat?
[58:03.630 --> 58:05.770]  This person who always gets references wrong.
[58:07.670 --> 58:08.430]  There's a dog on me!
[58:08.430 --> 58:09.690]  I love me some apocalypse now.
[58:12.290 --> 58:12.770]  Oh!
[58:13.030 --> 58:15.130]  Oh shit! It's on me!
[58:15.370 --> 58:16.490]  The dogs are going ape!
[58:17.930 --> 58:18.630]  Get away!
[58:20.290 --> 58:21.750]  Die, you dog-down
[58:21.750 --> 58:22.450]  dog dick!
[58:25.090 --> 58:25.410]  Ah!
[58:27.630 --> 58:28.910]  Ah! Dog bit!
[58:32.910 --> 58:34.770]  What do you think about this fight?
[58:34.830 --> 58:36.650]  Did he think, you know what, I'm going to open the dog door.
[58:36.650 --> 58:36.710]  Oh.
[58:40.270 --> 58:42.450]  I mean, there are hunting dogs.
[58:45.170 --> 58:46.070]  Holy shit!
[58:46.770 --> 58:47.110]  Oh!
[58:48.170 --> 58:49.290]  The hammer's hammering!
[58:51.010 --> 58:51.350]  Ow!
[58:53.790 --> 58:54.990]  That's okay, take your time.
[58:55.450 --> 58:56.830]  Okay, maybe, take less time.
[58:56.950 --> 58:57.430]  Take less time.
[58:58.390 --> 58:58.870]  I'm going to get it.
[59:00.230 --> 59:01.050]  Oh no!
[59:01.530 --> 59:02.110]  Ah!
[59:02.110 --> 59:02.530]  Another wave!
[59:04.350 --> 59:04.750]  Ah!
[59:05.790 --> 59:06.590]  Oh jeez.
[59:10.340 --> 59:10.620]  Alright.
[59:10.920 --> 59:12.580]  I kept the health.
[59:14.280 --> 59:14.760]  It's all yours!
[59:15.740 --> 59:16.520]  Yep, got him.
[59:17.080 --> 59:18.880]  He should have gone to the hammer store to get that repaired.
[59:21.380 --> 59:22.760]  Okay, I think one more,
[59:23.240 --> 59:24.540]  and we should be good, I'd say.
[59:25.640 --> 59:27.400]  So he can only take damage from his own hammer.
[59:28.140 --> 59:29.000]  I believe so.
[59:29.240 --> 59:31.120]  My hits when he was down were doing nothing.
[59:32.320 --> 59:33.400]  They look cool.
[59:33.820 --> 59:35.300]  I felt like I was more involved
[59:35.300 --> 59:36.660]  when I was doing them.
[59:43.740 --> 59:45.060]  A guy with a
[59:45.640 --> 59:46.480]  lightning hammer?
[59:49.420 --> 59:50.340]  Okay, here we go again.
[59:59.270 --> 01:00:00.170]  Go, go, go, go!
[01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.070]  I'm getting him, I'm getting him!
[01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:05.530]  I'm involved!
[01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:07.130]  I'm attacking his ass!
[01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:08.530]  Oh!
[01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:09.530]  Oh shit!
[01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:13.890]  Fuck yeah!
[01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:20.150]  Oh no!
[01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:23.330]  Bam!
[01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.150]  Goodbye Mr. Hammer.
[01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.430]  That was all she could come up with.
[01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.830]  Listen, she didn't write this story.
[01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:34.030]  This isn't her genre.
[01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:34.610]  Sayonara.
[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.130]  What would you have said?
[01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:41.850]  Sayonara, Mr. Hammer!
[01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.650]  Whoops!
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.030]  It's tool time for you, Mr. Hammer.
[01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.210]  Chop the wall! Bam!
[01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:08.410]  Oh no!
[01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:08.670]  Oh no!
[01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:12.470]  Hammer meet
[01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:14.510]  nail. Oh, a big ugly
[01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.970]  nail.
[01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.470]  Oh, it's a masher!
[01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:21.830]  It's a masher!
[01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:23.530]  Oh.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.160]  No more
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:28.680]  mashing!
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.500]  B-b-b-baby!
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.340]  Baby, you ain't seen nothing yet!
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:56.760]  Oh, what's this?
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:01:59.960]  Let's do this.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.040]  Yeah, let's side story this.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.500]  You're gonna like this one.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.500]  If you didn't like the last one, you're definitely
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.420]  gonna like this one, cause there's no
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.060]  way you dislike two back to back.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.560]  There's no sand sharks in this one, I assume.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.360]  Oh, a little farm.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.280]  Are we little?
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.280]  Oh, we're pigs.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.760]  Yes, calm down.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.480]  We're just pigs. Just pigs.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.280]  Just pigs!
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.340]  So I'm like weird crispy bacon
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.000]  and you're just classic British bacon?
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.120]  Yes, you're weird crispy bacon.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.180]  Oh, I got fart power!
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.580]  Oh, I gotta... I'm stretchy!
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.140]  I'm farting a rainbow!
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.540]  You're way better! Yours is way cooler!
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.420]  Magical rainbow farts
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.060]  are truly the best farts.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.320]  Fart over here!
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.280]  Have we...
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.940]  Has everything been done in video games?
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.080]  I think so.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.260]  Oh, that was a good effect.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.360]  Oh, I can roll around in the mud!
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.200]  Yeah!
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.060]  Just all muddy.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.060]  Happiest pigs in shit!
[01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:27.650]  What is this, a pig apple?
[01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:33.190]  Gotta feed the door.
[01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:35.930]  Why am I doing this?
[01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:39.190]  Am I supposed to get an apple or something?
[01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:40.430]  Is there an apple for me somewhere?
[01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:41.130]  I want an apple.
[01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:42.730]  Oh, there's an apple!
[01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:44.570]  Here's my offering, pig door!
[01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.350]  I got a Granny Smith!
[01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:49.810]  Oh, I've got a pink delicious.
[01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.510]  Pink lady.
[01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:59.490]  Oh, tomato!
[01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:01.230]  Tomatoes!
[01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:04.210]  What the hell is this game?
[01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.310]  Oh, it's the block.
[01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.870]  It's the Mario 64 block.
[01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:14.590]  Oh, you launch when you hit one of these bubbles.
[01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:16.310]  Oh, we got bubbles?
[01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.150]  We got bubble launches.
[01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:19.170]  Holy shit!
[01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:21.690]  Is this you or another pig?
[01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:24.310]  That's another pig.
[01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.630]  That's a random pig.
[01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:27.350]  Oh, hey, hey!
[01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.230]  We rolling in this shit?
[01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:29.990]  I was rolling.
[01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:32.990]  Are you just eating it?
[01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.410]  Oh, maybe...
[01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.270]  Oh, shit!
[01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.150]  I found an apple.
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.190]  Oh, where'd you find that?
[01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:50.370]  On top of the silo.
[01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:54.890]  Oh, there's my apple.
[01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:58.690]  Ah, schmecked!
[01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:01.530]  You schmecked it?
[01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:04.570]  Classic schmecking?
[01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:06.770]  What a schmeckle. Damn it!
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.660]  Oh, this is great.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.080]  I can just watch you.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.360]  Oh, that wasn't even close.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.660]  I'm trying to fart up to this.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.720]  Get me up there!
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.120]  There you go!
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.360]  360 fart!
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.540]  360 fart!
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:27.620]  Oh, shit!
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.060]  That wasn't the time to try the 360.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.180]  You're not used to being the farter.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.280]  You're used to being the farty.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.200]  You have years of farty experience.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.160]  I'm used to being...
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.740]  all of the stuff in the level
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:41.700]  that's getting farted on.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.300]  You are the farted.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.900]  Oh, is someone dropping turds next to you?
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.020]  Shitting, yeah.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.860]  Oh, I think it was one of the flying...
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.480]  Yeah, the flying pig is just shitting.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.920]  Flying around shitting everywhere.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.580]  Dirty bastard.
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:03.700]  Dirty bastard.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.700]  So what's the point of your power?
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.980]  You just jump?
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.400]  I can launch up things.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.460]  Yours is definitely cooler.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.120]  Shitting shovel that you've got going on there?
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:23.140]  Yeah.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.140]  You don't have one of those?
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.940]  I assume you shave outside
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.220]  then you grab your shitting shovel.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:34.220]  That's my daily routine.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.000]  See this little pig?
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:36.100]  Yeah.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.360]  Oh, a dead pig.
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.000]  Oh yeah, lemons.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.560]  What the fuck is going on over here?
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:51.660]  Shovel again.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.560]  Can I send you on this shovel?
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:56.760]  Oh.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.700]  Where are you? Okay, let's see.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.800]  Do you send me? Do I have to get the pink one?
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.780]  What?
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.220]  Do you see Porky?
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.020]  Do you see this?
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.780]  He's turning.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.560]  Oh, no.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.280]  Maybe if I go big.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.320]  Are you ready?
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:30.700]  Yep.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.080]  Oh, damn.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.280]  Oh, nice.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.240]  That was so cool.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:38.920]  Teamwork.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.080]  I see you got one of the apples.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.440]  I'm guessing the other one is over here.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.520]  Do I need to help you get it?
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:49.180]  Maybe.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.680]  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to...
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.420]  Oh, nice.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.240]  Oh, could you maybe...
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:07:59.600]  Get in this?
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:00.820]  Yeah.
[01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:06.470]  And then maybe get out of it.
[01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:08.850]  And then...
[01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:09.790]  Perfect.
[01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.630]  Great teamwork.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.840]  Okay, let's feed this door.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.340]  Bots away!
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.360]  All of apples.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:31.840]  Wolves.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.840]  What's the wolf?
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.880]  Do you fart through them?
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.520]  Can you fart through this house?
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.300]  Oh, like blow it away with a fart?
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.000]  Yeah, can you fart it?
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.400]  Well, it's made of bricks. You can't fart bricks down, surely?
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.380]  I wish that the straw house
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.580]  and the wooden house was still there.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.580]  Oh, a fart hole?
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.980]  I think that's a fart target.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.380]  Now check this shit.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.000]  Ugh!
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.580]  I huffed and I guffed.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.600]  And you farted
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.160]  your house down, you bitch!
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.140]  Look at you!
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.180]  Oh, I'm stuck! I'm getting out of here.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.780]  Oh, you're flying!
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.760]  I'm over the moon.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.680]  Can I avoid the hay?
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.500]  Is this the new 3D Mario
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:34.700]  platformer?
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.000]  Pig-nanza?
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.580]  Pig-nanza?
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:41.660]  Oh, shit!
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.240]  I got eaten by a hay bale.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.920]  If it was just 12 hours of this, I would buy this game.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:52.180]  What would the game be called?
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:53.960]  Pig-nanza?
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.880]  Babe, pig in the shitty?
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.620]  Oh, I got a shout-out.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:01.600]  You said that.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:02.740]  Perfect!
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.440]  The adventures of Farty and Elastipig?
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.340]  Bake-nanza.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.500]  I'm in my little
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.000]  basket.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.400]  Babe, can you believe it?
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.520]  Oh, that's
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.040]  good!
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.000]  Where are you?
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:39.960]  I'm in
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.020]  the basket. Where are you?
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.060]  Oh, just in this one?
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.280]  Yeah.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.480]  Oh, I thought I could just jump.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.440]  I thought we could just jump down.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.460]  Oh, different place.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.040]  That would have sucked if I jumped down there.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.280]  That would have just been the start of the level.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.840]  Can you fart still? I can't.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.240]  Nah.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.520]  That would have been prime farting
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.920]  time right there.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.740]  Oh! No!
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.700]  Oh no!
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.340]  No!
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.700]  We're a couple of damn
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:24.000]  dogs! Oh, we're some dogs!
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.280]  Oh, ketchup, ketchup, ketchup!
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:28.900]  Condiment me!
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:31.580]  Ah!
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:33.900]  You want some ketchup?
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.840]  Wait, you don't
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.380]  want your mustard?
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.220]  Yeah, we swap out.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.940]  Get some ketchup on you.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:42.520]  Me next!
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.660]  And some mustard.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.060]  Oh, you're looking good.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.700]  You didn't mustard me. Oh, you don't have mustard.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.480]  Oh, there we go.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.920]  I was mustard dodging.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.820]  You keep dodging the mustard.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.120]  Where do I need to stand?
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.060]  Under the mustard.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.820]  I thought I was, but alright.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.340]  Can't be raw dogs.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.760]  Yeah, surely we gotta get cooked.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.200]  Let's cook ourselves up real nice.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.560]  Oh, oh, let's get up.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.240]  Let's get up there.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.040]  Come on.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.480]  Hell yeah.
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.020]  Oh, I'm roasting.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.240]  Oh, that's good.
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.000]  That's great.
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:29.900]  I'm getting a nice, even...
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.200]  I'm grilled to perfection.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.340]  I think I perfectly grilled myself there.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:36.140]  Although...
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.920]  My mustard and ketchup aren't really on anymore.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.380]  Oh, no.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.760]  Oh, we gotta re-condiment.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.580]  We pre-condimented.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.280]  Okay.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:46.360]  That's it.
[01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:51.910]  Let's get these buns.
[01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:54.510]  Now that's great. I want a hot dog for lunch now.
[01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:56.290]  Oh, man.
[01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:57.490]  A hot dog sounds good.
[01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.450]  What?
[01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:01.510]  We were fine getting cooked,
[01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:02.570]  but we're not fine getting eaten?
[01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:05.450]  We already went into a blend?
[01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:06.890]  That was good. That was a good side quest.
[01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:09.150]  That was good. It was a lot of fun.
[01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:33.550]  They're moving on.
[01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.170]  I think it's the perfect time
[01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:35.990]  for us to stop, Gavin.
[01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:38.430]  What a great side quest.
[01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:39.230]  We got a lot done.
[01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:41.570]  We got a lot of fiction splitted,
[01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.850]  and we're going to continue to split fiction
[01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.510]  as we do.
[01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:47.470]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:49.850]  Make sure to check out our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:52.450]  We do podcasts. We do all sorts of goofy things.
[01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:54.570]  If you like this, I'm sure you would like that.
[01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:56.690]  Hope you have a fantastic day,
[01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:59.410]  and make sure to condiment your dogs.
[01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.630]  Put some ketchup,
[01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:01.870]  put some mustard on there.
[01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:03.710]  It's an important message
[01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:04.530]  to get to the people.
[01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:07.850]  It was like a Bob Barker message when he was losing it.
[01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:11.050]  I don't care about regular neutering your pets.
[01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:13.970]  I care about you condimenting your dogs appropriately.
[01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:15.730]  In it.
[01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:16.870]  There we go. I'm British.
[01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:18.750]  Talk to you soon, people.
[01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.950]  Bye.
