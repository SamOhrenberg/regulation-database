[00:00.000 --> 00:04.300]  Did you declare this is the Pico Park finale, Andrew? Sure did.
[00:05.020 --> 00:09.660]  You're a maniac. Why would you say that? Because it's the last of the main levels.
[00:10.940 --> 00:13.400]  What do you think finale means?
[00:14.200 --> 00:21.100]  Technicality. Have you ever heard of a season finale? Or an epilogue? You heard of an epilogue? There's tons. What do you think it means?
[00:21.800 --> 00:23.460]  That's a midseason finale sometimes.
[00:23.460 --> 00:30.840]  Did you call it a season finale? Yeah, finale just it has all sorts of meanings.
[00:31.020 --> 00:32.060]  It means the end of a thing.
[00:33.280 --> 00:35.860]  Well, that's the one meaning it has.
[00:37.660 --> 00:44.980]  501 is a finale on the week. That's true. Nobody says wrap it up. That's right. This isn't a fight worth having. Crumbs, whatever.
[00:45.180 --> 00:45.940]  What's the name?
[00:47.640 --> 00:51.540]  I did that earlier. I couldn't remember the name and I got it wrong. Crumbs and Crust.
[00:52.540 --> 00:56.080]  Crumbs and Bums. I kept wanting to say Crumb Bum as well.
[00:58.040 --> 01:04.900]  Crumb Bum. Boys, we're back. It's Pico Park. Apparently the finale unbeknownst to everyone else. Oh, yeah, we're finishing today.
[01:05.160 --> 01:11.980]  Come come with us. C-U-M-B. Let's do this thing. Last park. Let's get it over with boys. Let's start now.
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.980]  I gotta be honest with you guys. I feel like I'm gonna be extra bad today. Oh, I'm gonna be nice. I'm the nice one.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.820]  Is that gonna happen? Yeah. Why are you gonna be bad, Geoff? I don't know. It's just a vibe I get from myself. Long week vibes.
[01:25.060 --> 01:29.380]  Long week. A lot of Mario partying himself.
[01:29.520 --> 01:34.840]  Duty. A lot of Call of Duty. A lot of trucks. My wife's out of town. I only play video games if I'm old, you know.
[01:35.060 --> 01:39.260]  Yeah, you're being a naughty boy. I guess I'll stop when I see a bunch of piss rats, I guess.
[01:39.620 --> 01:43.180]  There have already been so many rats. So many. We're gonna need to see some more.
[01:44.020 --> 01:47.960]  When I stream, that's a thing where it is just people coming in and it is
[01:47.980 --> 01:50.360]  so many piss rats. Thank you.
[01:58.060 --> 02:00.100]  Everyone hold right. I gotta hold right?
[02:00.880 --> 02:06.600]  Yeah, all right. Did you don't see what happened? Oh, someone didn't move. That was me. I'm trying to adjust my mic. Okay, here we go.
[02:06.860 --> 02:10.760]  Adjust your fingers. You asked if you need to hold right and then you did nothing.
[02:13.080 --> 02:16.840]  I think it's very interesting all the shit-talking I got when I didn't die.
[02:17.420 --> 02:19.980]  Well, it's hard for me not to die when I'm at the back.
[02:20.080 --> 02:21.880]  Jump, jump, keep jumping, keep jumping, keep jumping!
[02:23.460 --> 02:24.580]  This is a great start.
[02:26.240 --> 02:31.160]  All right, whoever's first needs to jump so that the platform does not move. There we go.
[02:31.840 --> 02:33.740]  Ah, wait, we have to stack up, we have to stack up!
[02:34.040 --> 02:35.700]  Oh, yep, still goes up.
[02:37.400 --> 02:38.520]  Hmm, all right.
[02:38.940 --> 02:39.220]  Ah!
[02:41.660 --> 02:43.600]  Don't let go of right right now.
[02:44.020 --> 02:46.160]  We're back, we're back baby, we're back.
[02:46.160 --> 02:47.380]  Yeah, look at that!
[02:48.160 --> 02:48.600]  Jump!
[02:49.660 --> 02:51.060]  I'm not, I'm not gonna make it!
[02:55.120 --> 02:56.980]  Does that thing come back down at any point?
[02:57.400 --> 02:58.320]  Ah, shit.
[03:00.120 --> 03:01.920]  You just have to hold right.
[03:02.940 --> 03:03.500]  Keep right.
[03:04.480 --> 03:05.000]  Keep going right.
[03:05.600 --> 03:06.540]  Hey, how many players is this?
[03:07.620 --> 03:08.320]  There we go.
[03:09.020 --> 03:11.420]  Oh, so you can go all the way left also?
[03:11.560 --> 03:13.080]  Yeah, left and right.
[03:13.080 --> 03:13.920]  Okay, okay.
[03:15.380 --> 03:16.440]  Con with the...
[03:17.580 --> 03:21.000]  Con with the gifted subs, that death was dedicated to you, Con. Thank you so much.
[03:21.500 --> 03:22.560]  Are you walking left?
[03:23.320 --> 03:25.520]  Uh, I guess my default is to hold left.
[03:26.560 --> 03:26.960]  Why?
[03:27.180 --> 03:27.360]  Damn it.
[03:29.480 --> 03:31.400]  But the whole time we're just holding right.
[03:31.460 --> 03:32.520]  Why would you even touch that?
[03:32.640 --> 03:33.540]  I don't know, just a white screen.
[03:33.880 --> 03:34.380]  Oh, purple!
[03:36.180 --> 03:38.180]  Why aren't you just holding it by default?
[03:38.320 --> 03:39.360]  Like, why aren't you holding it right now?
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.660]  Yeah, just hold it right.
[03:41.420 --> 03:42.640]  I'm giving a little thumb break.
[03:43.220 --> 03:43.580]  What?
[03:46.720 --> 03:47.080]  Oops.
[03:47.260 --> 03:47.960]  There you go.
[03:49.940 --> 03:50.420]  Alright, now what?
[03:51.300 --> 03:52.060]  Now we go right.
[03:53.600 --> 03:54.320]  Hang on.
[03:54.620 --> 03:55.500]  Alright, in the middle then?
[03:56.100 --> 03:57.780]  Okay, I got the checkpoint.
[03:58.360 --> 04:00.340]  Here, everyone jump off and we'll get the other guys on.
[04:02.340 --> 04:02.700]  Well...
[04:05.060 --> 04:07.560]  Oh, hang on, we're gonna have to fight some saws here, I think.
[04:07.560 --> 04:08.960]  Oh, this is gonna be bad.
[04:09.040 --> 04:12.020]  Wait, wait, wait, everyone hold left as we can get.
[04:12.300 --> 04:13.020]  Alright, Nick, you got it?
[04:14.060 --> 04:15.300]  Go, go, go, go, go!
[04:15.340 --> 04:17.020]  Get off! No, no, no, you have to jump!
[04:17.240 --> 04:17.800]  Oh no!
[04:22.640 --> 04:26.140]  We have to only ever touch tips on it.
[04:26.460 --> 04:26.700]  Yeah.
[04:27.460 --> 04:27.860]  Oops.
[04:29.760 --> 04:30.580]  Here we go, boys.
[04:30.780 --> 04:33.040]  Okay, so Gavin, it's gonna be you this time.
[04:33.280 --> 04:33.500]  Ready?
[04:36.760 --> 04:38.400]  They are very fast, by the way.
[04:38.800 --> 04:39.380]  Go left!
[04:39.720 --> 04:40.320]  There we go.
[04:40.460 --> 04:41.620]  Oh, Gavin, you had it!
[04:41.700 --> 04:44.560]  Gavin, you did such a good job almost.
[04:44.760 --> 04:45.600]  Should I have not jumped?
[04:46.220 --> 04:48.380]  Yeah, I think if you would've kept going, you would've been fine.
[04:48.940 --> 04:49.240]  Okay.
[04:49.700 --> 04:50.900]  I don't really wanna do the key.
[04:51.040 --> 04:52.120]  I can do it, I can do it.
[04:52.280 --> 04:53.500]  Okay, you got it.
[04:54.680 --> 04:55.720]  Why are you over here?
[04:56.780 --> 04:58.100]  You gotta move red, I can't...
[04:58.100 --> 04:59.180]  Here we go!
[04:59.180 --> 04:59.780]  Now!
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.120]  Go, fellas!
[05:03.800 --> 05:04.680]  Come on!
[05:04.820 --> 05:05.860]  Oh, you jumped.
[05:06.580 --> 05:08.800]  It's catching up to me, regardless.
[05:09.100 --> 05:10.080]  I don't know what to do.
[05:11.340 --> 05:13.800]  Maybe, can you jump from the right to the left?
[05:13.800 --> 05:14.820]  Yeah, maybe.
[05:16.300 --> 05:17.480]  Just to get that momentum.
[05:18.040 --> 05:18.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:18.880 --> 05:21.300]  I need a little bit more right.
[05:21.460 --> 05:22.220]  Oh, Jesus.
[05:23.380 --> 05:25.100]  Should I risk touching these right now?
[05:25.720 --> 05:26.600]  Let's just try it. Ready?
[05:26.600 --> 05:28.040]  Here we go!
[05:28.420 --> 05:31.620]  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.880]  Wow, it's still...
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.840]  What am I...
[05:36.840 --> 05:37.440]  What are we missing?
[05:38.800 --> 05:39.740]  The solution.
[05:40.380 --> 05:41.760]  Ah, yes. Thank you.
[05:42.740 --> 05:43.780]  What are we missing?
[05:43.860 --> 05:45.380]  Because you're not fast enough.
[05:45.580 --> 05:46.280]  Oh my god.
[05:47.640 --> 05:50.160]  Oh, he is.
[05:50.360 --> 05:52.420]  He is fast.
[05:52.900 --> 05:54.820]  There is a little window to jump there.
[05:54.820 --> 05:58.380]  Yeah, and you can stay in the middle, Gav, if you can't make it all the way over, it looks like.
[05:58.400 --> 06:00.180]  Do it again, do it again. You got it.
[06:04.380 --> 06:06.280]  Hang on. There you go.
[06:07.480 --> 06:08.040]  Holy shit.
[06:10.000 --> 06:10.900]  Oh, way to go, boys.
[06:12.300 --> 06:13.320]  Oh, cool! Thanks, Nick!
[06:13.360 --> 06:14.940]  Way to go, Nick!
[06:15.480 --> 06:16.180]  Pretty awesome, man!
[06:16.180 --> 06:17.420]  We did it! We're fine!
[06:18.900 --> 06:20.920]  Nick, why were you just standing there?
[06:21.140 --> 06:23.020]  Jesus Christ, Nick. Do we know where the door is?
[06:23.020 --> 06:24.720]  Yeah, it's back where we started.
[06:25.180 --> 06:25.960]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[06:26.340 --> 06:29.080]  Because it's gotta be... this thing's gonna come back.
[06:29.840 --> 06:31.340]  But you can go to the right of it.
[06:31.940 --> 06:32.980]  One of us should go.
[06:33.300 --> 06:34.380]  Unlock it, and then we'll go one at a time.
[06:34.380 --> 06:35.880]  It's gotta be the key guy has to go first.
[06:36.860 --> 06:38.640]  Yeah, which appears to be purple.
[06:39.520 --> 06:39.820]  Purple.
[06:42.460 --> 06:43.620]  You handed it off to him.
[06:43.640 --> 06:44.420]  Alright, Nick, you got this.
[06:45.300 --> 06:46.680]  Alright, ready? Yep. Here we go.
[06:48.620 --> 06:48.940]  They...
[06:49.820 --> 06:50.140]  Nope.
[06:50.720 --> 06:52.480]  Alright. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[06:52.680 --> 06:54.280]  We should wait for it to come and go again.
[06:54.600 --> 06:54.780]  Yep.
[06:56.440 --> 06:57.200]  Hang on.
[06:57.720 --> 06:59.620]  No, I'm just sitting on him so he can't move.
[06:59.760 --> 07:00.380]  I don't trust him.
[07:01.900 --> 07:02.660]  Oh, God.
[07:05.680 --> 07:06.300]  Come on, Geoff.
[07:06.700 --> 07:07.100]  I'm gonna wait.
[07:08.580 --> 07:09.820]  It's okay, he's been really safe.
[07:10.420 --> 07:12.160]  Slow and steady wins the race.
[07:12.460 --> 07:14.040]  Good work, good work. You did it.
[07:15.240 --> 07:15.560]  Alright.
[07:16.500 --> 07:17.260]  Well done!
[07:17.260 --> 07:17.660]  Yeah!
[07:19.260 --> 07:21.440]  The Pico Park finale is underway.
[07:23.360 --> 07:25.760]  Mark the frog is here.
[07:26.780 --> 07:28.540]  Mark the frog in the house, baby.
[07:28.780 --> 07:30.660]  He hopes we had fun playing Monster Hunter.
[07:30.820 --> 07:31.480]  Oh, boy.
[07:32.080 --> 07:33.200]  Oh, boy.
[07:33.720 --> 07:35.040]  That'll be a video.
[07:35.420 --> 07:37.280]  What? Did the game end?
[07:37.840 --> 07:39.140]  No, it's doing that thing.
[07:39.960 --> 07:41.180]  Press X to show.
[07:41.540 --> 07:41.780]  Purple.
[07:43.220 --> 07:44.820]  Do what? What are we supposed to do?
[07:44.820 --> 07:46.240]  Oh, it's like a freeze frame thing?
[07:46.820 --> 07:46.980]  Yeah.
[07:48.660 --> 07:50.100]  I'm just gonna keep holding right.
[07:50.200 --> 07:51.100]  Everyone keep jumping.
[07:52.620 --> 07:53.860]  McNutstrop, thanks for the 10.
[07:54.680 --> 07:56.040]  Okay, we need to rearrange.
[07:56.440 --> 07:57.860]  Andrew, go left.
[07:59.180 --> 08:00.320]  I'm just gonna keep moving right.
[08:00.360 --> 08:01.880]  I'm on the bottom, so I gotta...
[08:01.880 --> 08:03.480]  There you go. Hit it.
[08:04.860 --> 08:05.660]  Hit X.
[08:06.700 --> 08:07.520]  I didn't get out of the way.
[08:08.480 --> 08:09.340]  I'm blocked in.
[08:10.040 --> 08:11.160]  Yeah, there you go.
[08:11.160 --> 08:14.360]  Now I should be where I'm supposed to be.
[08:14.900 --> 08:15.760]  Okay, let's see.
[08:16.260 --> 08:16.820]  Okay, cool.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.580]  So now Purple needs to jump over twice.
[08:19.720 --> 08:20.140]  And you get there.
[08:20.760 --> 08:22.360]  And we also need to push it a little bit.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.620]  Okay, I think I've done that.
[08:25.640 --> 08:26.500]  You got it? Okay.
[08:26.760 --> 08:28.740]  Now Red is gonna do the same.
[08:30.640 --> 08:32.700]  Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[08:33.140 --> 08:34.280]  I think I'm in position.
[08:34.780 --> 08:35.040]  Okay.
[08:38.200 --> 08:39.000]  Anytime, Purple.
[08:39.000 --> 08:39.460]  Purple.
[08:41.180 --> 08:41.620]  Okay.
[08:43.620 --> 08:44.740]  Red, you need to put...
[08:44.740 --> 08:45.700]  Yeah, there you go.
[08:47.160 --> 08:47.840]  I'm on it.
[08:49.220 --> 08:50.500]  I might be stuck behind Red.
[08:50.680 --> 08:51.340]  Oh, perfect.
[08:52.120 --> 08:54.220]  Oh, don't press.
[08:55.420 --> 08:55.860]  Orange time.
[08:56.520 --> 08:58.360]  Orange, very lightly move it over.
[08:58.600 --> 08:59.700]  You got it.
[09:01.280 --> 09:02.320]  You're not there.
[09:02.480 --> 09:02.820]  One more.
[09:04.520 --> 09:06.180]  I had to climb more than anybody else.
[09:06.180 --> 09:06.700]  That's true.
[09:07.220 --> 09:07.820]  Okay.
[09:09.900 --> 09:10.500]  Nice.
[09:11.060 --> 09:12.040]  So what do we do?
[09:12.600 --> 09:14.500]  I think...
[09:15.980 --> 09:17.180]  Everyone relax.
[09:17.480 --> 09:19.660]  I'm just moving it slightly closer.
[09:19.860 --> 09:20.260]  That's it.
[09:20.400 --> 09:21.260]  I see.
[09:23.720 --> 09:25.320]  That's it. That's all I'm doing.
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.320]  I tapped it.
[09:27.560 --> 09:29.300]  So now...
[09:30.100 --> 09:31.520]  Orange is gonna go.
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.100]  And we'll just do it like that.
[09:33.100 --> 09:33.860]  Go for it.
[09:35.800 --> 09:36.240]  Okay.
[09:37.560 --> 09:38.000]  Great.
[09:39.960 --> 09:41.260]  You're gonna have to keep moving, Geoff.
[09:41.400 --> 09:41.740]  I will.
[09:42.420 --> 09:43.420]  Blue is gonna go.
[09:46.860 --> 09:48.080]  Did you go one space?
[09:49.300 --> 09:49.540]  Nice.
[09:49.680 --> 09:51.000]  You went way too far, Geoff.
[09:51.340 --> 09:52.140]  Come on back a little bit.
[09:55.680 --> 09:55.800]  Okay.
[09:57.740 --> 09:58.620]  I was...
[09:58.620 --> 09:59.100]  Nice.
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.920]  You're just a real all or nothing guy.
[10:02.540 --> 10:03.820]  That's how I roll, man.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.540]  Friday 5.01pm.
[10:05.600 --> 10:06.880]  Thank you.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.700]  Thank you.
[10:09.420 --> 10:10.840]  You gotta get down there.
[10:12.220 --> 10:12.880]  There you go.
[10:14.120 --> 10:15.080]  Okay. It should be good.
[10:18.400 --> 10:18.640]  Okay.
[10:19.120 --> 10:20.420]  Nice. Climb up, Nick.
[10:20.900 --> 10:21.460]  There you go.
[10:24.640 --> 10:25.200]  Really?
[10:25.940 --> 10:26.240]  What happened?
[10:27.200 --> 10:28.600]  That was such bad luck.
[10:29.160 --> 10:30.120]  Nick, press the button.
[10:31.000 --> 10:31.520]  Nick.
[10:31.880 --> 10:33.700]  Now it's gotta be blue first.
[10:34.480 --> 10:34.500]  Yep.
[10:37.240 --> 10:38.740]  How you feeling, Nick?
[10:39.580 --> 10:40.100]  Andrew?
[10:41.220 --> 10:42.020]  Pretty good.
[10:42.560 --> 10:43.480]  Okay. Now it's purple.
[10:50.730 --> 10:51.430]  You ready?
[10:52.270 --> 10:52.510]  Yeah.
[10:54.330 --> 10:54.850]  Orange.
[10:56.990 --> 10:58.250]  Well, you know.
[10:58.790 --> 10:59.990]  You know there's a good reason for that.
[11:01.170 --> 11:02.150]  This is bad luck, Nick.
[11:02.150 --> 11:03.170]  I don't blame you on that one.
[11:03.850 --> 11:04.390]  Daddy's turn.
[11:06.570 --> 11:08.650]  I gotta go all the way up.
[11:11.230 --> 11:12.290]  Okay. I think I got it.
[11:13.150 --> 11:13.570]  There we go.
[11:14.170 --> 11:15.310]  I'm just gonna give it a little tap.
[11:15.490 --> 11:16.110]  Red, come on over.
[11:17.330 --> 11:20.310]  Hey, guys. This is an 8 player game.
[11:25.510 --> 11:25.870]  Let's...
[11:26.370 --> 11:27.390]  Blue. I guess blue.
[11:27.530 --> 11:28.230]  Just walk it.
[11:31.190 --> 11:31.550]  Okay.
[11:31.610 --> 11:32.010]  Okay, let's look.
[11:33.050 --> 11:34.350]  I would say a little bit more.
[11:34.850 --> 11:35.130]  Okay.
[11:36.610 --> 11:37.970]  There we go. That's good.
[11:38.850 --> 11:40.810]  I saw someone else move other than the bottom.
[11:41.430 --> 11:41.950]  That was me.
[11:42.150 --> 11:43.410]  Just a little bit of movement.
[11:44.150 --> 11:45.950]  Blue, I think you can do it one more time and you got it.
[11:46.730 --> 11:47.630]  You say when.
[11:49.070 --> 11:50.210]  Let's see how we feel about that.
[11:50.430 --> 11:51.050]  I'm showing it.
[11:51.450 --> 11:52.650]  I would say a little bit more.
[11:53.250 --> 11:53.310]  Yeah.
[11:53.310 --> 11:53.470]  Yeah.
[11:55.370 --> 11:56.470]  Oh, stop. Stop.
[11:56.810 --> 11:57.530]  He stopped.
[11:57.650 --> 11:59.410]  I trust him.
[11:59.910 --> 12:01.470]  He stopped. He's got it.
[12:02.110 --> 12:03.050]  That's pretty good.
[12:03.130 --> 12:05.090]  That's about a Nick-sized gap. Do we trust him?
[12:07.090 --> 12:09.190]  If you need to stand right before the jump,
[12:09.310 --> 12:10.390]  then just do it from there.
[12:10.950 --> 12:11.150]  Yeah.
[12:14.750 --> 12:15.690]  Oh, look at that.
[12:15.790 --> 12:17.210]  Like a bloody magic trick.
[12:20.110 --> 12:21.450]  I don't think I made it.
[12:21.450 --> 12:22.410]  Show it to me one more time.
[12:22.690 --> 12:23.690]  As soon as I can.
[12:24.930 --> 12:26.550]  I'm gonna make my move. Here we go.
[12:28.250 --> 12:28.610]  Nice.
[12:29.970 --> 12:30.470]  I'm over.
[12:32.130 --> 12:32.850]  Lifting screen.
[12:34.570 --> 12:35.550]  Oh, nice, Geoff.
[12:36.030 --> 12:36.450]  Way to go.
[12:37.550 --> 12:39.450]  Make it all the way, baby. You got it.
[12:42.330 --> 12:43.050]  Lifting screen.
[12:44.770 --> 12:45.710]  Oh, wow.
[12:45.870 --> 12:46.890]  Good job, Nick.
[12:47.010 --> 12:49.510]  Nick, now's the time that you can
[12:49.510 --> 12:50.470]  absolve yourself.
[12:51.310 --> 12:53.150]  Hold on, I'm just lightly moving.
[12:54.470 --> 12:56.870]  Okay, Nick.
[12:57.330 --> 12:58.610]  You got this.
[12:59.070 --> 12:59.930]  Okay, I got it.
[13:03.110 --> 13:04.070]  We're alive.
[13:04.570 --> 13:07.790]  Alright, Gavin.
[13:08.450 --> 13:09.190]  Alright, Gavin.
[13:09.730 --> 13:11.610]  Oh my god, Gavin.
[13:12.810 --> 13:12.850]  Gavin.
[13:14.170 --> 13:14.970]  Come on.
[13:15.530 --> 13:17.770]  Okay, everyone hold right.
[13:19.450 --> 13:19.850]  Gduff.
[13:21.130 --> 13:21.770]  10 gifted.
[13:21.910 --> 13:23.210]  Hell yeah, thank you. Alright, let's see.
[13:23.310 --> 13:24.110]  Thank you so much.
[13:24.450 --> 13:28.510]  If you're confused watching this, we can't move when the screen comes up until like a couple of seconds off.
[13:28.570 --> 13:29.570]  Okay, everyone jump and go.
[13:30.730 --> 13:31.430]  Let's get that checkpoint.
[13:32.010 --> 13:32.370]  Okay.
[13:32.670 --> 13:34.410]  I think I got it.
[13:34.410 --> 13:36.630]  Mike Lenny said, man, I always feel like Eric's to blame.
[13:36.890 --> 13:37.890]  Man, couldn't be more wrong.
[13:38.390 --> 13:39.850]  Enjoy being wrong, Mike. Here we go.
[13:40.790 --> 13:41.950]  How are we going to do this?
[13:42.070 --> 13:44.890]  Do you want to stack? You're going to have the three stack and then walk in?
[13:45.030 --> 13:47.190]  Yeah, let's show because I don't know what we're doing.
[13:48.970 --> 13:50.430]  Alright, I'm going to jump on green.
[13:51.170 --> 13:52.830]  Okay, I think I'm on green.
[13:52.990 --> 13:53.770]  I think I'm on green.
[13:54.190 --> 13:54.530]  Okay.
[13:57.670 --> 13:58.710]  Come on in, red.
[13:58.710 --> 14:00.710]  Now, red, you should be able to get on top of me.
[14:00.830 --> 14:01.470]  You got it.
[14:02.010 --> 14:02.910]  Red did not move.
[14:04.010 --> 14:05.010]  He's got it right here.
[14:05.570 --> 14:07.070]  Shit, sorry.
[14:07.570 --> 14:08.970]  I'll go back the other way.
[14:09.830 --> 14:11.010]  There you go.
[14:13.850 --> 14:14.330]  Shit.
[14:16.450 --> 14:17.930]  I will not move.
[14:18.510 --> 14:18.790]  You got it.
[14:20.670 --> 14:21.150]  Okay.
[14:22.110 --> 14:23.890]  I think we're in.
[14:25.150 --> 14:25.630]  Yes!
[14:25.630 --> 14:26.910]  I'm going to walk over.
[14:27.050 --> 14:27.450]  Here I come.
[14:27.990 --> 14:29.790]  Now, keep the stack because you need the key.
[14:31.550 --> 14:32.310]  Okay, show.
[14:32.770 --> 14:33.950]  I'm as soon as I can.
[14:35.850 --> 14:36.650]  Geoff, go.
[14:37.150 --> 14:37.510]  It's you.
[14:38.210 --> 14:40.230]  Oh, we're going back.
[14:41.130 --> 14:41.690]  Don't move.
[14:43.270 --> 14:43.990]  Nobody move.
[14:45.090 --> 14:45.750]  We're in trouble.
[14:47.270 --> 14:48.490]  How many do you need on that?
[14:49.530 --> 14:49.930]  Three.
[14:51.310 --> 14:52.110]  Why is it over here?
[14:52.110 --> 14:53.150]  I don't know.
[14:53.510 --> 14:54.030]  Show.
[14:55.370 --> 14:58.610]  It said three because it was counting down to five of us.
[14:58.770 --> 14:59.410]  It needs all five.
[15:01.070 --> 15:01.890]  That's a problem.
[15:02.150 --> 15:02.690]  We need to die.
[15:03.630 --> 15:03.830]  Yep.
[15:06.210 --> 15:06.730]  Laughter.
[15:10.610 --> 15:11.970]  The action shot.
[15:12.730 --> 15:13.250]  Laughter.
[15:15.010 --> 15:16.150]  Alright, so we all
[15:16.150 --> 15:18.330]  need to move like crazy
[15:18.670 --> 15:19.070]  at the end.
[15:19.890 --> 15:21.350]  I need to hold that right stick
[15:21.350 --> 15:22.210]  on the final push.
[15:22.770 --> 15:23.890]  Yeah, but like when?
[15:25.710 --> 15:27.190]  We might all need to be stacked
[15:27.190 --> 15:27.650]  or something.
[15:27.930 --> 15:29.530]  Should we just do a big lovely stack?
[15:31.710 --> 15:33.190]  We can do a three and a two.
[15:33.550 --> 15:34.430]  We need a three and a two.
[15:36.410 --> 15:37.150]  Alright, why don't you
[15:37.150 --> 15:38.690]  jump on me blue and we'll be three-two.
[15:39.090 --> 15:39.610]  Or we'll be two.
[15:41.330 --> 15:42.190]  Might have overshot that.
[15:43.130 --> 15:45.130]  Now, were you able to walk onto the platform, Eric?
[15:45.190 --> 15:45.850]  Or did you have to jump?
[15:45.850 --> 15:46.630]  Oh, I walked on.
[15:47.270 --> 15:49.170]  Purple, get on me.
[15:50.130 --> 15:50.230]  Okay.
[15:51.390 --> 15:52.490]  I should be up there.
[15:56.050 --> 15:57.010]  Oh, shit.
[15:57.350 --> 15:58.730]  Okay, red get on me and that's it.
[15:59.650 --> 16:01.270]  Is that going to be tall enough to get the...
[16:01.270 --> 16:02.890]  I don't know if it's tall enough to get the key.
[16:03.870 --> 16:04.890]  I'll get on top of Gavin.
[16:05.030 --> 16:07.490]  Were you trying to get on Eric or us?
[16:08.370 --> 16:08.810]  I don't know.
[16:09.610 --> 16:12.050]  What are we doing right now?
[16:12.350 --> 16:13.770]  I'm on top of Gavin now.
[16:13.770 --> 16:14.370]  Go.
[16:15.430 --> 16:15.870]  Okay.
[16:16.830 --> 16:18.190]  So now do we walk on?
[16:18.870 --> 16:19.950]  I'm going to walk on.
[16:20.510 --> 16:21.470]  I'm doing a bit.
[16:23.810 --> 16:24.830]  Okay, we got the key.
[16:25.570 --> 16:26.450]  Everyone hold right.
[16:26.550 --> 16:28.090]  Hold right.
[16:29.090 --> 16:30.130]  Oh, I don't need to hold right.
[16:30.370 --> 16:31.490]  I think we got it.
[16:32.890 --> 16:33.810]  Yes! No!
[16:35.570 --> 16:37.890]  I didn't know there were spikes to the right.
[16:39.310 --> 16:40.530]  What a heartbreaker.
[16:40.530 --> 16:41.450]  We got it though.
[16:43.330 --> 16:44.250]  That's good to know.
[16:44.650 --> 16:46.110]  We can adjust. We got this.
[16:46.450 --> 16:47.610]  That was such a jump scare.
[16:49.510 --> 16:50.910]  I'll get to Gavin.
[16:59.960 --> 17:02.220]  I thought I went so much further than I did.
[17:03.600 --> 17:05.160]  Get on me and then here we go.
[17:05.260 --> 17:06.420]  I think I'm good.
[17:09.340 --> 17:10.600]  This is stressful.
[17:10.900 --> 17:11.460]  Holy ass.
[17:12.580 --> 17:13.360]  What's going on?
[17:13.440 --> 17:14.460]  How did you get on the other side of me?
[17:14.520 --> 17:17.540]  I don't think I can go back without
[17:17.960 --> 17:18.320]  moving.
[17:22.060 --> 17:23.080]  It's a little bit of a mess.
[17:23.480 --> 17:25.240]  We need purple
[17:26.060 --> 17:27.120]  to go on top of
[17:27.680 --> 17:28.040]  Geoff.
[17:29.820 --> 17:30.980]  I think I did that.
[17:32.320 --> 17:33.520]  We both need to move forward
[17:33.520 --> 17:35.080]  just a hair because we need to let Andrew up.
[17:36.100 --> 17:37.100]  Alright, Andrew, hop up.
[17:37.320 --> 17:38.640]  I think I'm up.
[17:38.640 --> 17:39.200]  Okay.
[17:40.700 --> 17:41.060]  Yep.
[17:42.640 --> 17:44.440]  Why did Geoff move?
[17:45.160 --> 17:46.720]  Just to get out of the way to give you guys some room.
[17:46.960 --> 17:48.460]  We're not going to get the key, right?
[17:49.800 --> 17:50.640]  We need a
[17:50.640 --> 17:52.100]  bigger stack on the three.
[17:54.180 --> 17:54.540]  Andrew,
[17:55.040 --> 17:55.880]  you need to jump on top of me.
[17:56.380 --> 17:57.380]  I think we get the key.
[17:57.580 --> 17:58.680]  I think we're good.
[18:00.380 --> 18:01.580]  I think I just fell off.
[18:03.960 --> 18:04.420]  Oh, cool.
[18:04.480 --> 18:05.320]  I'm over here now?
[18:05.320 --> 18:05.760]  Okay.
[18:07.200 --> 18:08.240]  Hang on.
[18:08.580 --> 18:09.560]  I didn't move.
[18:09.940 --> 18:11.480]  Blue needs to get on top of red.
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.280]  Blue needs to get on top of red
[18:15.280 --> 18:17.020]  and then red needs to walk on.
[18:18.140 --> 18:19.140]  Now red walk on?
[18:19.860 --> 18:20.380]  How?
[18:20.480 --> 18:21.760]  How did that happen?
[18:21.960 --> 18:23.760]  How did that happen?
[18:24.740 --> 18:27.240]  Did you just swish through the tiny gap?
[18:27.340 --> 18:28.300]  I don't know.
[18:28.920 --> 18:30.120]  That doesn't make any damn sense.
[18:31.100 --> 18:33.100]  Thank you so much for the five gifted.
[18:33.100 --> 18:33.960]  Appreciate you.
[18:35.220 --> 18:36.800]  Okay, Geoff, jump on me.
[18:37.360 --> 18:38.060]  Jump on green.
[18:38.900 --> 18:39.860]  I'm going to jump on purple.
[18:41.500 --> 18:42.640]  Do you know what?
[18:43.220 --> 18:43.820]  No, it's fine.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.420]  Okay, and then...
[18:46.420 --> 18:48.380]  I can hop on purple as well.
[18:49.800 --> 18:51.200]  Oh, Gavin, what happened?
[18:52.300 --> 18:53.320]  Why did you do that?
[18:53.620 --> 18:54.560]  I moved so Andrew could get up.
[18:55.160 --> 18:55.460]  Oh.
[18:56.720 --> 18:58.100]  I thought you jumped off.
[18:59.540 --> 19:01.040]  I think that jumping was Andrew.
[19:01.040 --> 19:02.740]  Okay, I've walked on
[19:02.740 --> 19:04.200]  to the platform.
[19:04.320 --> 19:06.120]  I haven't moved because I was waiting for Andrew.
[19:06.360 --> 19:07.600]  So we're on the platform.
[19:07.920 --> 19:09.620]  So as it goes down, you can sit up, Nick.
[19:10.260 --> 19:12.760]  Do you want to not be on top of Gavin?
[19:13.180 --> 19:14.740]  No, we only need two seconds.
[19:15.280 --> 19:17.180]  Okay, I haven't gotten on the platform yet then.
[19:18.520 --> 19:18.900]  Alright, here we go.
[19:23.170 --> 19:23.950]  Did you move?
[19:24.230 --> 19:25.790]  I was just...
[19:25.790 --> 19:28.970]  Okay, hang on.
[19:29.450 --> 19:31.530]  We'll wait a second and then hold right.
[19:32.170 --> 19:33.030]  Oh, hold right.
[19:33.110 --> 19:33.690]  Right there.
[19:34.550 --> 19:35.550]  I think we should have it.
[19:36.050 --> 19:36.490]  Yes!
[19:39.390 --> 19:41.110]  I need to figure out the key.
[19:41.510 --> 19:42.630]  Geoff, don't move.
[19:42.770 --> 19:43.450]  I'm not going to move.
[19:45.010 --> 19:46.390]  We need... show again.
[19:47.290 --> 19:47.870]  I have the key.
[19:48.670 --> 19:50.450]  I'm going to...
[19:50.450 --> 19:52.230]  Andrew, you need to move left.
[19:52.790 --> 19:54.170]  And Gavin, you need to move left.
[19:55.770 --> 19:56.630]  Into the door?
[19:57.770 --> 19:58.370]  Who's green?
[19:58.370 --> 20:00.110]  Oh, I'm sorry, Nick. Nick needs to move left.
[20:00.210 --> 20:03.230]  I got purple and blue confused.
[20:04.290 --> 20:05.690]  I moved a little bit to the left.
[20:06.590 --> 20:08.110]  Okay, so Andrew...
[20:08.110 --> 20:10.470]  Yeah, just move right. And then you jump on Gavin.
[20:10.590 --> 20:11.490]  That'll be it. Go for it.
[20:11.830 --> 20:12.070]  That's fine.
[20:13.890 --> 20:14.710]  Should I hold right?
[20:15.770 --> 20:16.130]  No.
[20:17.950 --> 20:19.710]  Hang on, Nick, move left some.
[20:20.450 --> 20:21.710]  Okay, move left.
[20:22.450 --> 20:24.310]  I think I have... okay, I think that was it.
[20:25.870 --> 20:26.410]  That's it.
[20:26.410 --> 20:28.230]  Alright, everyone come to the door.
[20:28.450 --> 20:29.070]  One at a time.
[20:29.550 --> 20:29.990]  Pile in.
[20:33.730 --> 20:34.450]  How's it looking?
[20:35.410 --> 20:35.990]  There you go.
[20:36.130 --> 20:37.390]  Just jam on the up button.
[20:37.750 --> 20:39.350]  You guys got this.
[20:40.990 --> 20:41.590]  Way to go, guys.
[20:42.850 --> 20:43.270]  Way to go.
[20:43.530 --> 20:43.970]  Clear.
[20:45.530 --> 20:47.130]  That was phenomenal.
[20:47.670 --> 20:49.670]  That was crazy.
[20:50.370 --> 20:52.190]  That one took a little longer than the first one.
[20:52.650 --> 20:53.390]  Just a little bit.
[20:53.390 --> 20:53.730]  Oh my goodness.
[20:55.530 --> 20:56.130]  I'm the shield.
[20:57.490 --> 20:59.030]  You can turn back.
[21:00.450 --> 21:00.930]  Got it.
[21:01.070 --> 21:01.990]  Is that friendly fire?
[21:02.410 --> 21:02.730]  Yes.
[21:06.450 --> 21:07.270]  I'm a shield.
[21:07.850 --> 21:08.410]  I'm a shield.
[21:10.650 --> 21:11.470]  What do I want to do?
[21:11.510 --> 21:12.450]  Get in the back if I've got a shield?
[21:13.030 --> 21:14.890]  That's my fault. You're good, Nick.
[21:15.590 --> 21:15.750]  Okay.
[21:16.570 --> 21:17.790]  Oh my god.
[21:18.790 --> 21:20.150]  I got back.
[21:20.150 --> 21:21.830]  I got friendly fired.
[21:23.830 --> 21:25.570]  Who friendly fired you?
[21:28.490 --> 21:29.330]  Ah, shit.
[21:30.670 --> 21:31.250]  Nice.
[21:31.350 --> 21:33.670]  Sorry, that wasn't me. I got in your way.
[21:36.270 --> 21:38.350]  You go back. I'll go the front.
[21:38.690 --> 21:39.430]  Die, Andros.
[21:40.710 --> 21:43.570]  You'll never defeat Andros.
[21:45.090 --> 21:46.450]  Use the boost to get through.
[21:47.450 --> 21:48.750]  Who are you guys?
[21:50.230 --> 21:51.190]  We're Starfire.
[21:53.010 --> 21:54.290]  Good dodge, Gavin.
[21:54.910 --> 21:55.230]  Thank you.
[21:55.770 --> 21:56.450]  He's building up.
[21:57.170 --> 22:00.010]  This is so difficult.
[22:01.310 --> 22:02.510]  Where are they coming from?
[22:02.590 --> 22:03.070]  There's a door.
[22:03.390 --> 22:05.530]  I think we're gonna...
[22:08.650 --> 22:09.130]  Missiles.
[22:09.630 --> 22:10.110]  Now we know.
[22:12.070 --> 22:13.230]  I hate being done.
[22:13.230 --> 22:14.810]  I got shot in the back of the head.
[22:15.670 --> 22:16.730]  Gavin, you're not a shield.
[22:16.730 --> 22:16.770]  You're a shield.
[22:19.430 --> 22:21.230]  You heal eventually, though.
[22:21.530 --> 22:23.490]  Yeah, you just gotta not get hit twice.
[22:26.850 --> 22:27.650]  Got you.
[22:27.990 --> 22:29.090]  Shot in the back of the head again.
[22:30.270 --> 22:31.610]  I'm just gonna stay down here.
[22:32.010 --> 22:33.710]  Thank you.
[22:35.630 --> 22:36.410]  I got you.
[22:38.130 --> 22:38.610]  I got you.
[22:39.470 --> 22:40.590]  There you go.
[22:41.910 --> 22:42.150]  Look out.
[22:42.610 --> 22:42.990]  That was on me.
[22:42.990 --> 22:43.410]  Oh.
[22:44.750 --> 22:46.210]  We were in a groove.
[22:46.510 --> 22:47.490]  That felt good.
[22:47.970 --> 22:50.190]  I feel like this is gonna take us to 5-0-1.
[22:51.470 --> 22:52.990]  It may very well.
[22:53.070 --> 22:53.830]  Geoff just got shot.
[22:54.890 --> 22:55.230]  Good.
[22:55.650 --> 22:57.630]  I think we need to focus on one or the other.
[22:57.650 --> 22:58.770]  I'm doing the back.
[23:00.830 --> 23:02.870]  Everybody fire on the front.
[23:03.250 --> 23:04.170]  I think so, right?
[23:04.450 --> 23:06.310]  I'll try to protect the back.
[23:07.170 --> 23:07.770]  You're good.
[23:08.950 --> 23:11.530]  That way, nobody's ever gonna fire on Geoff.
[23:11.530 --> 23:13.070]  That's my bad.
[23:13.330 --> 23:13.970]  That's on me.
[23:14.050 --> 23:14.410]  That's on me.
[23:17.690 --> 23:18.930]  We call it payback.
[23:19.090 --> 23:19.950]  Doing good damage.
[23:21.710 --> 23:22.510]  Nice dodge.
[23:23.090 --> 23:23.890]  Watch out.
[23:24.770 --> 23:24.990]  Form up.
[23:28.450 --> 23:29.430]  What do you mean, form up?
[23:29.490 --> 23:30.050]  Behind the shields?
[23:30.650 --> 23:31.650]  What do you mean?
[23:34.410 --> 23:36.630]  I got the top.
[23:36.710 --> 23:37.530]  Extra health, I guess.
[23:37.610 --> 23:38.270]  How did you do that?
[23:38.270 --> 23:39.410]  It's true.
[23:42.210 --> 23:43.050]  There's apples?
[23:43.230 --> 23:44.250]  Everyone focus on the front.
[23:45.410 --> 23:46.910]  Geoff, move up.
[23:47.650 --> 23:49.310]  There you go.
[23:50.330 --> 23:51.410]  Great shielding.
[23:52.050 --> 23:52.590]  Purple.
[23:52.870 --> 23:53.570]  I died.
[23:55.270 --> 23:55.990]  Sorry, Eric.
[23:56.470 --> 23:58.290]  I was too in the middle.
[23:58.670 --> 24:00.070]  I think I shot you while I was dodging.
[24:01.030 --> 24:04.150]  Maybe the others who don't have shields should get the shielding.
[24:04.830 --> 24:05.450]  The apples.
[24:06.250 --> 24:07.250]  Gun apples?
[24:07.470 --> 24:07.970]  Yeah.
[24:08.450 --> 24:09.350]  Gun apples.
[24:10.590 --> 24:12.370]  I'm focusing fire on the front.
[24:13.250 --> 24:14.130]  I'm shooting up top.
[24:15.350 --> 24:16.630]  What are you doing?
[24:16.770 --> 24:17.990]  Nick, what are you doing?
[24:18.370 --> 24:18.770]  Helping.
[24:19.270 --> 24:20.950]  I don't know about that, buddy.
[24:23.690 --> 24:24.730]  Glug, glug, glug.
[24:26.130 --> 24:26.950]  That's bullshit.
[24:29.470 --> 24:30.250]  Get back and secure.
[24:30.250 --> 24:31.310]  Ow.
[24:33.230 --> 24:34.090]  Form up.
[24:34.810 --> 24:35.510]  Form up.
[24:36.690 --> 24:38.990]  Shoot the guy behind us.
[24:39.650 --> 24:40.490]  There you go.
[24:40.550 --> 24:40.930]  Watch it.
[24:44.850 --> 24:46.630]  Camera Cardinal 5 gifted.
[24:46.750 --> 24:47.350]  Thank you so much.
[24:50.810 --> 24:52.230]  I'm no gun.
[24:53.930 --> 24:55.110]  I'm no gun?
[24:56.610 --> 24:57.570]  I'm also no gun.
[24:58.090 --> 24:58.730]  Team no gun.
[24:58.730 --> 25:00.930]  Can I just get right in this business here?
[25:01.050 --> 25:01.690]  You did.
[25:02.530 --> 25:03.970]  You can, but you gotta be careful.
[25:07.070 --> 25:09.010]  I don't like being the shield or the gun.
[25:09.110 --> 25:09.510]  It turns out.
[25:10.030 --> 25:12.330]  You don't like being the shield or the gun?
[25:12.870 --> 25:13.110]  No.
[25:14.570 --> 25:16.050]  I got pushed into it.
[25:16.870 --> 25:17.310]  Oh boy.
[25:19.850 --> 25:20.770]  I was good, Geoff.
[25:20.790 --> 25:22.010]  You just ate him with that shield.
[25:23.530 --> 25:24.950]  Is the shield like a one hit?
[25:25.430 --> 25:26.190]  It's a one hit.
[25:26.190 --> 25:26.570]  It's a one hit.
[25:26.750 --> 25:29.570]  Is it a one hit or is it the shield?
[25:34.310 --> 25:35.110]  Watch out.
[25:35.110 --> 25:36.190]  Watch out, Orange.
[25:38.450 --> 25:39.770]  Geoff's going nuts style.
[25:39.910 --> 25:40.350]  I love it.
[25:41.510 --> 25:43.290]  You're doing so good at navigating, Geoff.
[25:43.370 --> 25:43.790]  I'm really impressed.
[25:46.290 --> 25:47.230]  Good job, Geoff.
[25:47.870 --> 25:48.110]  Form up.
[25:49.030 --> 25:49.430]  Get in the middle.
[25:52.450 --> 25:53.390]  There we go.
[25:53.390 --> 25:54.250]  I'm good.
[25:54.310 --> 25:56.230]  I'm just trying to scoot where I can.
[25:58.390 --> 25:59.630]  You shot me.
[25:59.690 --> 26:00.930]  You shot me right in the back.
[26:01.030 --> 26:01.530]  There's a bull.
[26:02.330 --> 26:03.590]  I killed Gavin.
[26:05.830 --> 26:08.950]  We didn't even lose to...
[26:08.950 --> 26:14.210]  I lost my shield.
[26:14.990 --> 26:15.790]  It recharges.
[26:17.790 --> 26:18.890]  Your apple shield.
[26:19.370 --> 26:21.730]  On the second wave, we gotta shoot the arms it looks like.
[26:21.730 --> 26:22.670]  You can't just shoot the middle.
[26:23.230 --> 26:25.890]  In the second wave, there are these eyes that poke out.
[26:26.410 --> 26:27.070]  I'm sorry.
[26:27.170 --> 26:28.650]  These blue spheres that appear.
[26:29.130 --> 26:30.210]  I think we have to shoot those.
[26:31.430 --> 26:33.110]  They're on the arms of the thing.
[26:34.030 --> 26:35.310]  I see what you're saying.
[26:39.310 --> 26:40.390]  Good job, shield.
[26:40.850 --> 26:41.370]  Way to go.
[26:43.030 --> 26:44.230]  It's less than half.
[26:44.650 --> 26:45.450]  Everyone form up.
[26:46.210 --> 26:46.710]  Hold!
[26:46.710 --> 26:47.010]  Hold!
[26:48.630 --> 26:49.750]  It's in front of us.
[26:50.070 --> 26:50.570]  I'm sorry.
[26:52.810 --> 26:54.210]  It hit you.
[26:55.610 --> 26:57.190]  Aim for the red and blue.
[26:58.670 --> 26:59.530]  Come on.
[26:59.730 --> 27:00.710]  Come on.
[27:02.430 --> 27:02.990]  Come on.
[27:02.990 --> 27:06.170]  It almost died.
[27:06.410 --> 27:08.810]  If you're in that section.
[27:08.970 --> 27:09.910]  If you're the shield.
[27:10.770 --> 27:12.570]  Try not to get in front of those eyes.
[27:12.750 --> 27:14.490]  I know that's really hard.
[27:15.330 --> 27:17.110]  I almost had that one dead.
[27:17.590 --> 27:19.490]  So we'll just stay out of the way of the shield.
[27:19.870 --> 27:20.450]  Avoid the eyes.
[27:21.350 --> 27:22.390]  Just avoid those eyes.
[27:23.290 --> 27:25.490]  I think concentrating on one is the name of the game.
[27:25.710 --> 27:27.510]  I think that we are...
[27:27.510 --> 27:29.450]  I think we're really close to beating this.
[27:29.590 --> 27:30.790]  I think we're doing a really good job.
[27:34.550 --> 27:35.210]  Careful Gavin!
[27:35.570 --> 27:37.890]  Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[27:38.590 --> 27:38.970]  That's okay.
[27:40.490 --> 27:42.110]  Gavin ran in front of a bullet.
[27:42.110 --> 27:43.110]  There we go.
[27:43.250 --> 27:44.650]  It loves making me the shield.
[27:46.070 --> 27:48.390]  I've been the shield a long time.
[27:48.730 --> 27:49.730]  Have you been the gun yet, Andrew?
[27:50.290 --> 27:51.470]  Like twice maybe.
[27:53.070 --> 27:53.750]  Mainly shield.
[27:54.170 --> 27:54.830]  Gavin, back up.
[27:55.510 --> 27:57.230]  It's okay, I'm eating that back up.
[27:59.250 --> 28:00.190]  Shoot the other one.
[28:00.710 --> 28:01.450]  Help me!
[28:02.110 --> 28:02.850]  Oh shit.
[28:05.890 --> 28:07.770]  My eyes, the goggles do nothing.
[28:10.050 --> 28:11.130]  Nick, back up.
[28:14.710 --> 28:15.910]  I died.
[28:17.430 --> 28:19.670]  I tried desperately to help Nick.
[28:20.930 --> 28:21.530]  This...
[28:21.530 --> 28:22.650]  This is rough.
[28:22.990 --> 28:23.510]  Here we go.
[28:25.030 --> 28:27.010]  I'm gonna be so aggressive.
[28:27.170 --> 28:27.970]  I got a little shield.
[28:28.570 --> 28:29.170]  Sorry!
[28:31.150 --> 28:32.590]  My shield's gone.
[28:33.270 --> 28:34.430]  I'll go left, you go right.
[28:34.430 --> 28:35.910]  Jesus, guys!
[28:36.390 --> 28:36.770]  What are you doing?
[28:37.070 --> 28:37.830]  Losing it here.
[28:39.290 --> 28:42.750]  I think we got the wrong players on the wrong things here.
[28:43.430 --> 28:44.370]  We're doing damage.
[28:44.510 --> 28:45.030]  We're doing damage.
[28:45.650 --> 28:47.090]  Yeah, those people are getting messed up.
[28:48.610 --> 28:50.170]  Watch it, Andrew. You got it.
[28:50.850 --> 28:51.750]  Andrew, back up. There you go.
[28:52.290 --> 28:52.750]  Sorry.
[28:53.190 --> 28:54.210]  Nice purple.
[28:56.130 --> 28:57.030]  Form up!
[28:57.990 --> 28:58.610]  Get behind us!
[29:01.490 --> 29:02.150]  Get it, Blue.
[29:02.150 --> 29:02.870]  Get it, Blue.
[29:04.190 --> 29:06.250]  I'm trying to see what the hell are you doing?
[29:06.470 --> 29:07.230]  I'll go left.
[29:07.850 --> 29:10.310]  Why did you run and keep shooting the eyes?
[29:10.550 --> 29:11.290]  Shoot the eyes!
[29:11.530 --> 29:13.130]  Oh, boys, guys.
[29:18.770 --> 29:21.590]  Oh, I'll get you.
[29:21.670 --> 29:23.450]  These big ass fucking missiles.
[29:24.290 --> 29:24.550]  Ow!
[29:26.370 --> 29:27.110]  I'm dead.
[29:27.970 --> 29:28.950]  That was close.
[29:28.950 --> 29:29.210]  That was close.
[29:31.330 --> 29:32.330]  God damn, dude.
[29:33.030 --> 29:34.250]  This is such a...
[29:34.250 --> 29:34.770]  Oh, shit!
[29:36.470 --> 29:36.830]  Nope.
[29:38.830 --> 29:40.450]  Nick had one, Andrew had one.
[29:40.790 --> 29:42.630]  Yeah, my bad. Sorry, I did not mean to get them.
[29:43.010 --> 29:43.950]  Does anyone have a turbo controller?
[29:47.170 --> 29:48.110]  Your fingers getting tired?
[29:48.330 --> 29:48.690]  A little bit.
[29:51.470 --> 29:52.590]  Watch out! We're getting close!
[29:52.610 --> 29:53.070]  I got you.
[29:54.290 --> 29:54.730]  Oh, me?
[29:54.730 --> 29:56.790]  I was trying to...
[29:56.790 --> 29:58.570]  trying not to get in your way while you were firing.
[29:58.570 --> 29:58.970]  Are you Gavin?
[30:00.370 --> 30:01.610]  Good job, Nick.
[30:01.950 --> 30:03.350]  I got you.
[30:04.270 --> 30:04.770]  There you go.
[30:05.630 --> 30:07.130]  I got it.
[30:07.530 --> 30:07.830]  Form up!
[30:10.470 --> 30:11.310]  There you go.
[30:12.810 --> 30:13.550]  Shoot, Blue!
[30:14.050 --> 30:15.110]  You're fine.
[30:15.290 --> 30:16.710]  Shoot the eyes!
[30:19.190 --> 30:20.150]  Not each other!
[30:20.610 --> 30:21.570]  Shoot it!
[30:21.570 --> 30:21.910]  Shoot it!
[30:24.590 --> 30:24.950]  Missile!
[30:25.710 --> 30:27.130]  I took a missile to the grid.
[30:30.150 --> 30:31.930]  I don't like the form up bit
[30:31.930 --> 30:33.470]  because Nick yells at me if I don't shoot
[30:33.470 --> 30:35.970]  and also says don't go out there if I do try and shoot.
[30:36.390 --> 30:37.770]  Well, you don't have to go chase it down.
[30:37.890 --> 30:39.770]  I was just waiting!
[30:40.990 --> 30:42.710]  Geoff, you want to get the left side?
[30:43.370 --> 30:44.970]  You don't have to focus on it the whole time.
[30:45.170 --> 30:47.190]  Yeah, I'll get those...
[30:48.170 --> 30:49.950]  Yeah, those big ones that just come out of nowhere.
[30:49.950 --> 30:50.590]  Thank you.
[30:51.030 --> 30:51.590]  Doing great.
[30:54.190 --> 30:55.230]  Way to go, boys.
[30:55.430 --> 30:56.490]  Good job, fellas.
[30:58.790 --> 30:59.530]  Watch it, Andrew.
[30:59.610 --> 31:00.170]  You're good.
[31:01.570 --> 31:02.550]  There you go.
[31:04.010 --> 31:04.650]  Form up!
[31:05.750 --> 31:06.530]  Form up here.
[31:06.930 --> 31:07.570]  Gavin, come down!
[31:11.270 --> 31:12.550]  Things are going to float on by.
[31:12.910 --> 31:13.470]  Yeah, just let it...
[31:13.470 --> 31:14.150]  Oh, it's going to hit Gavin.
[31:15.690 --> 31:16.590]  Got it. Shoot the eyes.
[31:16.590 --> 31:17.990]  Okay, get the eyes.
[31:18.330 --> 31:21.390]  Shooting these eyes at the top of the screen.
[31:21.710 --> 31:22.970]  There's a missile there.
[31:23.490 --> 31:24.930]  Please help me, someone.
[31:25.590 --> 31:26.430]  Oh, fuck.
[31:26.670 --> 31:26.950]  We got it.
[31:29.310 --> 31:30.890]  Please help me, someone.
[31:32.750 --> 31:34.290]  Oh, now we all get them.
[31:34.710 --> 31:36.570]  Five Cosmic Crisps.
[31:36.690 --> 31:38.230]  Where's my gun? Did someone blow my shield?
[31:39.350 --> 31:39.790]  Yeah.
[31:40.370 --> 31:42.490]  Alright, Gavin, focus on the right.
[31:42.530 --> 31:43.390]  I'll get the ones on the left.
[31:44.330 --> 31:44.670]  Okay.
[31:45.350 --> 31:47.050]  And then I'll turn back to help you on the right.
[31:53.920 --> 31:54.820]  We're locked in, boys.
[31:55.060 --> 31:55.600]  We're locked in.
[31:58.980 --> 32:00.240]  Get them. Wreck them.
[32:00.680 --> 32:01.340]  Wreck their shops.
[32:03.160 --> 32:04.700]  There we go. We're doing great.
[32:05.800 --> 32:07.120]  Okay, when the eyes show up, Eric,
[32:07.200 --> 32:08.960]  I'm going to go a little bit below you on the top.
[32:08.980 --> 32:09.840]  Okay, that's fine.
[32:12.600 --> 32:13.260]  Come on.
[32:13.920 --> 32:14.600]  Come on.
[32:15.160 --> 32:15.480]  Nice.
[32:15.860 --> 32:18.080]  Alright, so what am I doing as a shield now? Just blocking missiles?
[32:18.680 --> 32:19.960]  There we go. Shoot the eyes.
[32:21.080 --> 32:21.840]  This one's dead.
[32:22.120 --> 32:23.880]  Come on.
[32:24.200 --> 32:24.520]  Sorry.
[32:26.280 --> 32:28.220]  Andrew, I killed you. I'm so sorry.
[32:28.600 --> 32:29.420]  Oh, man.
[32:30.160 --> 32:31.760]  We did really good. That lineup was great.
[32:32.360 --> 32:33.400]  I gotta take a...
[32:34.580 --> 32:36.320]  I gotta take a backseat when that happens.
[32:36.460 --> 32:37.920]  I gotta make sure that...
[32:38.440 --> 32:40.340]  If there's someone in front... Okay, I got it.
[32:40.360 --> 32:41.220]  I got left.
[32:41.220 --> 32:42.280]  Oh, yeah, you got left again?
[32:42.380 --> 32:42.960]  Alright, boy.
[32:44.680 --> 32:48.200]  You two guys on shield duty was really the shit.
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.720]  Let me tell you.
[32:50.740 --> 32:51.420]  Charge back up.
[32:52.120 --> 32:52.680]  There we go.
[32:54.140 --> 32:54.300]  Hello.
[32:56.560 --> 32:57.540]  That was my fault.
[32:57.920 --> 32:58.860]  No, no, no. That's my fault.
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.240]  Okay, we got it less than half.
[33:01.320 --> 33:03.460]  This is the most damage I think we've ever done to this side.
[33:03.700 --> 33:04.360]  Watch it. Watch it.
[33:05.060 --> 33:06.560]  Form up. Form up.
[33:08.340 --> 33:08.700]  Eek!
[33:08.700 --> 33:08.760]  Eek!
[33:10.180 --> 33:11.600]  I'm gonna do the same thing on the top.
[33:11.840 --> 33:14.160]  Yep, you got it. Just make sure you don't shoot each other
[33:14.160 --> 33:15.340]  because it's gonna start moving up and down.
[33:16.300 --> 33:18.060]  Look out for missiles. Missiles.
[33:18.780 --> 33:19.140]  Boop!
[33:19.740 --> 33:20.640]  Those were the missiles.
[33:20.880 --> 33:22.300]  Can we block the missiles?
[33:23.140 --> 33:24.860]  Shields block missiles.
[33:28.400 --> 33:30.040]  That was feeling pretty good.
[33:30.860 --> 33:31.740]  Geoff, get your apple.
[33:31.860 --> 33:33.600]  I was fighting.
[33:34.800 --> 33:35.300]  No need.
[33:35.460 --> 33:36.180]  Geoff, get your apple.
[33:36.180 --> 33:37.640]  I'm gonna get those balls.
[33:43.980 --> 33:47.280]  Oh, God. I got turned around there a little bit.
[33:53.060 --> 33:54.120]  Oh, don't shoot me.
[33:54.680 --> 33:55.580]  Geoff, don't shoot me.
[33:55.900 --> 33:56.480]  I'm trying not to.
[33:58.520 --> 33:59.340]  Pew, pew, pew!
[34:00.580 --> 34:02.580]  This is good damage on this guy.
[34:03.260 --> 34:03.940]  Okay, form up.
[34:06.660 --> 34:07.700]  Shoot it, Geoff. You got it.
[34:07.780 --> 34:08.760]  Oh, we got three.
[34:09.620 --> 34:10.640]  We're in a good spot here, Andrew.
[34:10.640 --> 34:12.100]  Alright, I'm taking the top.
[34:12.640 --> 34:14.140]  Do not shoot me.
[34:14.960 --> 34:16.180]  Don't shoot me either.
[34:18.720 --> 34:19.360]  Missile.
[34:20.560 --> 34:21.300]  Got it. Nice block.
[34:22.340 --> 34:23.460]  I'm one away.
[34:23.540 --> 34:24.840]  He's almost done.
[34:25.540 --> 34:26.580]  Alright, he's done.
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.440]  Left side.
[34:30.680 --> 34:31.960]  Left side.
[34:32.140 --> 34:32.320]  Okay.
[34:33.720 --> 34:34.560]  Sorry, Gavin.
[34:36.860 --> 34:37.880]  You're fine.
[34:37.880 --> 34:38.360]  You're fine.
[34:38.760 --> 34:41.120]  This one's a tough bastard.
[34:41.320 --> 34:42.160]  Yeah, this one's got a lot.
[34:42.540 --> 34:44.060]  Well, we haven't hit him yet.
[34:45.560 --> 34:47.120]  You got it. Doing great.
[34:47.640 --> 34:50.520]  Just don't push up too far.
[34:50.920 --> 34:52.020]  Don't get shot.
[34:52.640 --> 34:53.440]  Shoot him in the eyes.
[34:54.060 --> 34:54.280]  Fuck.
[34:54.860 --> 34:57.840]  The eyes are pretty difficult this time.
[34:58.920 --> 35:00.920]  We can't block those, Nick.
[35:01.140 --> 35:02.280]  But you can block those.
[35:02.540 --> 35:04.120]  Yeah, got it.
[35:04.860 --> 35:06.040]  I'm okay. I'm healing up.
[35:06.040 --> 35:06.180]  That's it.
[35:06.540 --> 35:09.180]  Nobody move. Just chill.
[35:09.960 --> 35:10.300]  Hang on.
[35:11.980 --> 35:13.100]  One person.
[35:13.840 --> 35:14.460]  That's it.
[35:16.960 --> 35:19.760]  All we needed was the power of Cosmic Crisp.
[35:20.560 --> 35:21.060]  Great work.
[35:21.220 --> 35:22.060]  Five apples.
[35:22.600 --> 35:23.660]  That was fantastic.
[35:24.820 --> 35:27.860]  Guys, this is it. The finale. The grand finale.
[35:29.200 --> 35:30.320]  Holy bejesus.
[35:30.740 --> 35:31.400]  Oh my god.
[35:31.400 --> 35:32.100]  It's blue.
[35:33.560 --> 35:34.760]  Spin move.
[35:36.040 --> 35:36.420]  360.
[35:37.500 --> 35:39.260]  I think we all need to get on one.
[35:40.420 --> 35:41.180]  I'm on.
[35:41.500 --> 35:42.080]  Okay.
[35:44.260 --> 35:45.420]  I think it worked.
[35:45.520 --> 35:46.680]  It just had to make that platform, right?
[35:47.080 --> 35:47.580]  Yes.
[35:53.400 --> 35:55.020]  The boy's back.
[36:04.200 --> 36:05.060]  Oh, jeez.
[36:05.100 --> 36:06.960]  I got shoved.
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.640]  I got fucking shoved.
[36:10.980 --> 36:12.580]  I got bullied right off the edge.
[36:13.660 --> 36:14.360]  Oh, okay.
[36:14.440 --> 36:15.500]  We can affect each other. Interesting.
[36:17.360 --> 36:18.280]  I'm over here.
[36:18.340 --> 36:19.520]  I haven't pressed forwards yet.
[36:20.720 --> 36:21.540]  Okay. Go.
[36:22.940 --> 36:23.860]  Oh my god.
[36:24.080 --> 36:25.580]  Stack. Stack. Stack.
[36:25.900 --> 36:26.400]  Stackage.
[36:28.180 --> 36:29.840]  Get off me for the love of god.
[36:31.200 --> 36:31.760]  Goodbye.
[36:31.760 --> 36:34.300]  I mean, as far as an improvised stack,
[36:34.380 --> 36:35.100]  that was pretty good.
[36:35.320 --> 36:36.900]  Not bad.
[36:37.160 --> 36:38.140]  What's the stack order?
[36:38.980 --> 36:40.680]  It's just the order we're in currently, right?
[36:40.820 --> 36:42.700]  That's me. That's totally me.
[36:43.020 --> 36:45.880]  I forgot that we were
[36:45.880 --> 36:46.720]  playing a game.
[36:47.860 --> 36:49.180]  So I'll be the bottom of the stack.
[36:50.520 --> 36:51.260]  I'll go top.
[36:51.560 --> 36:52.720]  Oh, I got jumped on.
[36:55.040 --> 36:56.020]  Oh, that was brutal.
[36:58.740 --> 36:59.660]  I've got to run this time.
[36:59.660 --> 37:01.420]  Why is your default
[37:01.420 --> 37:02.100]  to hold left?
[37:02.500 --> 37:04.960]  What are you doing?
[37:05.220 --> 37:07.120]  How many levels have ever been left?
[37:07.720 --> 37:08.980]  No, I wasn't holding left.
[37:09.020 --> 37:11.420]  I just wasn't holding anything.
[37:11.820 --> 37:12.760]  Oh, jeez.
[37:13.900 --> 37:16.040]  That got some weird stacking, man.
[37:16.140 --> 37:16.860]  That was crazy.
[37:18.420 --> 37:19.840]  That was awesome.
[37:21.320 --> 37:21.620]  Gavin!
[37:24.080 --> 37:25.780]  Gavin, you made it slow.
[37:26.540 --> 37:27.580]  Just hold right.
[37:27.580 --> 37:29.020]  Why isn't everyone just holding right now?
[37:29.140 --> 37:31.260]  I just like that we can be pushed. It's so fun.
[37:31.720 --> 37:33.680]  Oh, yeah, it's great when we all die.
[37:34.300 --> 37:35.040]  Okay, be careful.
[37:35.900 --> 37:36.160]  Okay.
[37:36.860 --> 37:37.380]  Stack.
[37:39.240 --> 37:40.080]  I'll get on.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.180]  Keep pushing him.
[37:43.820 --> 37:45.080]  Move over. That's it.
[37:45.580 --> 37:47.220]  Calm. Calm. Calm.
[37:47.540 --> 37:48.440]  Calm. Calm.
[37:48.780 --> 37:50.740]  Go. Go. Go.
[37:55.320 --> 37:56.740]  Don't worry, guys. I got this.
[37:57.860 --> 37:58.920]  Andrew, I can't believe
[37:58.920 --> 38:00.760]  you kept living after I...
[38:00.760 --> 38:02.740]  I don't know how we got
[38:02.740 --> 38:03.720]  to that platform.
[38:04.240 --> 38:06.660]  We were just timing it so that I was jumping slightly
[38:06.660 --> 38:07.220]  before you.
[38:08.980 --> 38:10.740]  You hit me like a bloody Newton's cradle.
[38:10.760 --> 38:11.160]  There we go.
[38:11.720 --> 38:15.380]  Alright, you only need four.
[38:15.580 --> 38:16.600]  Yeah, this is you right here.
[38:17.000 --> 38:17.700]  Alright, give me...
[38:17.700 --> 38:18.820]  There we go. Let's go.
[38:18.940 --> 38:19.860]  Get off of each other.
[38:20.860 --> 38:21.980]  Everyone chill, you bean.
[38:24.860 --> 38:25.900]  I don't know what's next.
[38:26.000 --> 38:26.460]  I'm just scared.
[38:27.240 --> 38:27.640]  Relax.
[38:29.300 --> 38:29.560]  Okay.
[38:37.100 --> 38:38.320]  Get off of me.
[38:39.800 --> 38:41.640]  I was reading.
[38:41.640 --> 38:42.580]  I was like...
[38:44.940 --> 38:46.400]  You read the words
[38:46.400 --> 38:47.220]  thank you?
[38:47.680 --> 38:48.500]  Are you sure?
[38:49.760 --> 38:51.340]  He's trying to put it together like it was
[38:51.340 --> 38:52.060]  Wheel of Fortune.
[38:52.300 --> 38:54.740]  I thought it was going to be really long.
[38:54.960 --> 38:57.260]  Like Mario, I thought it would go on for a bit.
[38:57.440 --> 38:59.600]  I think I actually hate you a little bit
[38:59.600 --> 39:00.080]  right now.
[39:00.180 --> 39:01.840]  That was nuts.
[39:05.540 --> 39:07.200]  Alright, Andrew.
[39:08.000 --> 39:09.680]  I'm going to push the next 30 minutes
[39:09.680 --> 39:11.260]  of not being able to beat the last level
[39:11.260 --> 39:13.000]  because Gavin learned how to read today.
[39:14.760 --> 39:16.120]  I'd like to solve the puzzle.
[39:16.300 --> 39:17.440]  Do it another 50 times.
[39:18.640 --> 39:19.480]  Don't make me laugh.
[39:19.980 --> 39:21.040]  Chill out.
[39:23.280 --> 39:23.680]  Alright.
[39:29.480 --> 39:29.880]  Boy.
[39:31.940 --> 39:33.880]  Hang on, what word comes
[39:33.880 --> 39:34.700]  after thank?
[39:35.260 --> 39:37.000]  I wanted to see what was after thank.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.880]  Hey, don't punch me so hard,
[39:38.940 --> 39:39.580]  you assholes.
[39:40.220 --> 39:43.760]  There you go.
[39:44.100 --> 39:46.100]  I got jacked, dude.
[39:46.160 --> 39:46.720]  I got shoved.
[39:46.920 --> 39:49.080]  That was great.
[39:52.700 --> 39:54.980]  What word comes after thank?
[39:55.860 --> 39:56.960]  That is so
[39:56.960 --> 39:57.860]  fucking funny.
[39:58.880 --> 39:59.640]  Alright.
[40:01.740 --> 40:02.860]  Oh, jeez.
[40:03.260 --> 40:04.620]  I can't fucking stop.
[40:04.620 --> 40:06.280]  I can't stop
[40:06.280 --> 40:07.440]  hitting you guys.
[40:08.100 --> 40:10.140]  Then you gotta not be the third guy up.
[40:10.140 --> 40:12.020]  I don't want to be the third guy up.
[40:12.500 --> 40:14.260]  Well, you're the second now. Congratulations.
[40:14.900 --> 40:15.420]  Thanks!
[40:15.940 --> 40:16.660]  That's on me.
[40:22.180 --> 40:24.700]  All the platforming I successfully
[40:24.700 --> 40:26.420]  pulled off on that first try
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.800]  I will never do again. Gavin has unleashed
[40:28.800 --> 40:29.500]  a misery.
[40:29.500 --> 40:30.300]  Go!
[40:32.100 --> 40:33.760]  Sorry. There we go.
[40:37.190 --> 40:37.870]  Go!
[40:38.630 --> 40:39.810]  Get the fuck up there.
[40:41.210 --> 40:42.230]  Chill out!
[40:43.110 --> 40:44.070]  Don't make me laugh.
[40:45.150 --> 40:46.350]  Beat the fucking level!
[40:46.630 --> 40:47.350]  Oh my god, Geoff.
[40:47.790 --> 40:49.710]  Thanks again, Gavin.
[40:50.630 --> 40:53.110]  Every death that I have
[40:53.110 --> 40:54.330]  from here on out is your fault.
[40:55.650 --> 40:56.830]  I tribute all
[40:56.830 --> 40:58.010]  those deaths to Gavin.
[40:58.010 --> 40:59.570]  I had beaten the game.
[40:59.690 --> 41:00.510]  I was at the door.
[41:01.430 --> 41:02.250]  Blame me later.
[41:03.670 --> 41:05.370]  The blame is funny. It is rude.
[41:06.370 --> 41:08.150]  Oh, Geoff, me. I'm in place.
[41:12.290 --> 41:13.150]  Get off me.
[41:13.650 --> 41:18.170]  I just missed that jump
[41:18.170 --> 41:18.850]  so bad.
[41:19.150 --> 41:21.510]  That's your death, Gavin? That was embarrassing.
[41:22.390 --> 41:24.090]  That's maybe the worst death I've ever had
[41:24.090 --> 41:24.550]  in this game.
[41:25.010 --> 41:26.130]  That's not your death, dude.
[41:26.190 --> 41:27.630]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[41:28.050 --> 41:30.590]  You know what? That's great. As the guy drops
[41:30.590 --> 41:32.530]  me off the cliff, he just keeps going, sorry, sorry,
[41:32.530 --> 41:34.370]  sorry, sorry. I was just holding right.
[41:34.510 --> 41:36.570]  I was going faster than you, apparently. You can think about it all the
[41:36.570 --> 41:37.170]  way down.
[41:42.090 --> 41:42.710]  Alright, boys.
[41:43.830 --> 41:44.710]  Jeez! Chill out!
[41:44.710 --> 41:45.370]  Oh my god.
[41:51.540 --> 41:52.880]  Got it? Yep.
[41:53.540 --> 41:53.800]  Alright.
[41:56.380 --> 41:57.220]  Oh my god, I jumped so early.
[41:57.220 --> 41:58.000]  And now we got some time.
[41:58.940 --> 42:00.040]  That's Gavin's death.
[42:04.180 --> 42:05.220]  I mistimed it.
[42:05.800 --> 42:07.200]  I mean, Gavin mistimed it.
[42:07.720 --> 42:08.500]  Come on.
[42:10.360 --> 42:12.040]  I gotta find out what word
[42:12.040 --> 42:13.920]  comes out of that, guys. We gotta get there.
[42:14.300 --> 42:16.200]  I gotta know what word comes next.
[42:16.600 --> 42:17.960]  What could they possibly be saying
[42:17.960 --> 42:18.460]  to us?
[42:20.480 --> 42:22.340]  Thank more Ovaltine.
[42:23.160 --> 42:24.560]  Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[42:24.940 --> 42:25.800]  Could have been thank god.
[42:26.380 --> 42:27.220]  Thank you.
[42:30.020 --> 42:31.640]  I should call it round team.
[42:31.940 --> 42:32.220]  Okay.
[42:36.440 --> 42:37.560]  What are you doing?
[42:38.580 --> 42:39.640]  What happened?
[42:39.860 --> 42:40.680]  How did you?
[42:41.040 --> 42:43.420]  Gavin, how did you do that?
[42:43.420 --> 42:44.440]  It shoved me down a hole.
[42:45.500 --> 42:45.720]  Yeah.
[42:47.060 --> 42:48.180]  Come on.
[42:49.400 --> 42:51.620]  That's Gavin's death. You guys are nuts.
[42:52.480 --> 42:54.260]  Geoff just palmed my face.
[42:55.580 --> 42:56.140]  Heisman.
[42:58.160 --> 42:59.120]  Compared to other
[42:59.780 --> 43:01.540]  levels, I'm not even sweating this.
[43:01.640 --> 43:03.460]  This level means nothing to me.
[43:03.740 --> 43:04.340]  This is fun.
[43:06.400 --> 43:09.740]  Dude, we gotta find out what the rest of it says.
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.200]  Come on, Geoff. Anytime.
[43:13.240 --> 43:14.140]  There you go, buddy.
[43:14.220 --> 43:14.680]  Here we go.
[43:15.600 --> 43:17.160]  We're a little bit clumped.
[43:18.840 --> 43:19.400]  Here we go, Geoff.
[43:20.000 --> 43:20.440]  Declumped.
[43:21.200 --> 43:21.640]  Beautiful.
[43:21.640 --> 43:21.980]  Beautiful.
[43:23.220 --> 43:23.740]  Okay.
[43:25.360 --> 43:26.400]  Don't do that.
[43:27.160 --> 43:28.460]  There you go.
[43:30.060 --> 43:31.540]  That's what happens when you come on, Geoff.
[43:31.640 --> 43:31.920]  Let's go.
[43:33.020 --> 43:34.340]  I fucking died.
[43:36.060 --> 43:37.180]  I'm not rushing you.
[43:37.300 --> 43:38.480]  There's a level that's moving.
[43:40.740 --> 43:41.620]  Ultimately, it's
[43:41.620 --> 43:43.480]  Gavin's death anyway, so it doesn't matter.
[43:43.660 --> 43:45.460]  It's attributed to his column, but yeah.
[43:47.060 --> 43:49.300]  That's what happens when you come on, Geoff.
[43:54.220 --> 43:54.860]  That's it.
[43:55.260 --> 43:56.160]  Good job, dead Gavin.
[43:59.020 --> 44:01.400]  I think it counts for 10 deaths, and then it's back to
[44:01.400 --> 44:02.140]  anyone's to blame.
[44:04.160 --> 44:05.260]  I just gotta see what
[44:05.260 --> 44:06.920]  that big note says, man.
[44:07.300 --> 44:09.680]  I won't be happy until I know what it says.
[44:11.440 --> 44:12.040]  I'm good.
[44:13.120 --> 44:14.000]  I'm not bl- No.
[44:14.220 --> 44:15.060]  That was a quick stack.
[44:16.680 --> 44:17.680]  There you go, boys.
[44:18.040 --> 44:18.360]  In space?
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.320]  Hell yeah.
[44:22.960 --> 44:24.740]  YOU BUNNY SHAT ME AGAIN.
[44:25.260 --> 44:25.820]  Is this what happens
[44:25.820 --> 44:26.640]  when you come on, Geoff?
[44:27.740 --> 44:28.740]  Just keep going.
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.820]  We were going too fast
[44:31.820 --> 44:32.200]  for the level.
[44:33.460 --> 44:35.300]  We were going too fast for the level.
[44:36.200 --> 44:36.900]  Did you call me an addict?
[44:37.980 --> 44:39.460]  No, I was trying to call you an asshole and an idiot
[44:39.460 --> 44:40.140]  at the same time.
[44:41.820 --> 44:42.640]  One more, boys.
[44:43.500 --> 44:44.080]  You got it, Geoff.
[44:44.080 --> 44:44.600]  You got it, Geoff.
[44:46.020 --> 44:46.460]  Alright.
[44:50.360 --> 44:51.620]  What is happening?
[44:52.240 --> 44:53.580]  Why are you turning around?
[44:54.320 --> 44:56.460]  Because I was gonna miss.
[44:56.940 --> 44:58.480]  The level's moving too slow
[44:58.480 --> 44:59.920]  to go at that pace at that point.
[45:01.080 --> 45:01.500]  I agree.
[45:01.960 --> 45:04.060]  We can wait as a group and then just go, go, go.
[45:04.940 --> 45:05.180]  Okay.
[45:06.920 --> 45:07.580]  Oh god.
[45:08.040 --> 45:08.820]  My face hurts.
[45:10.080 --> 45:10.860]  Nice, Geoff.
[45:10.860 --> 45:12.300]  You at it.
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.600]  Can we get an at it flag?
[45:16.960 --> 45:17.600]  Alright.
[45:18.000 --> 45:18.860]  We can wait.
[45:19.680 --> 45:20.000]  Okay.
[45:22.640 --> 45:24.240]  I mean, who's waiting
[45:24.240 --> 45:25.680]  and there's whatever this is.
[45:26.580 --> 45:29.200]  Is everyone okay?
[45:29.800 --> 45:30.380]  What happened?
[45:31.640 --> 45:32.960]  Alright, what does this say?
[45:33.480 --> 45:33.840]  Stop!
[45:34.980 --> 45:35.620]  Go!
[45:36.300 --> 45:37.880]  Why is everyone waiting?
[45:37.880 --> 45:38.580]  What's happening?
[45:38.900 --> 45:41.180]  Are you guys?
[45:41.880 --> 45:43.060]  What's going on?
[45:43.540 --> 45:45.020]  Oh, it says thank you.
[45:45.840 --> 45:46.240]  Oh.
[45:47.640 --> 45:47.940]  Geoff.
[45:49.480 --> 45:50.700]  Geoff, did you see it?
[45:51.120 --> 45:51.520]  I did.
[45:53.960 --> 45:56.080]  Are you as impressed as we are?
[45:58.980 --> 45:59.580]  God!
[46:00.700 --> 46:00.840]  Alright.
[46:01.980 --> 46:02.520]  Come on, Gavin.
[46:03.120 --> 46:03.360]  Gavin!
[46:05.220 --> 46:06.760]  So what were you doing?
[46:07.560 --> 46:10.340]  Me? I wasn't walking the whole platform off the edge!
[46:10.640 --> 46:11.500]  No, you pushed it.
[46:11.500 --> 46:14.000]  We have to keep up with the fucking map, dude!
[46:15.080 --> 46:16.400]  We're gonna get left off the edge!
[46:16.400 --> 46:18.040]  You kept shoving the platform.
[46:18.200 --> 46:18.920]  That's not true!
[46:19.120 --> 46:20.800]  You kept kicking it away!
[46:21.160 --> 46:22.240]  No, I didn't!
[46:22.940 --> 46:23.180]  I'm up.
[46:26.160 --> 46:27.060]  Andrew, you got it.
[46:27.180 --> 46:28.160]  Quick, quick, quick.
[46:28.980 --> 46:30.080]  You're good, you're good.
[46:30.080 --> 46:31.360]  Wait, give it a second, give it a second.
[46:31.460 --> 46:32.300]  Give it a second.
[46:33.560 --> 46:34.760]  There you go.
[46:37.160 --> 46:37.860]  The thing is,
[46:37.880 --> 46:39.700]  we don't control the movement speed of the level.
[46:39.960 --> 46:42.080]  Like, it doesn't...
[46:48.040 --> 46:49.380]  Oh my god.
[46:49.480 --> 46:49.880]  Oh, Geoff.
[46:51.180 --> 46:51.500]  Ah!
[46:53.040 --> 46:54.480]  Oh, thank you. There it is.
[46:58.900 --> 47:00.400]  Can we talk about the ending?
[47:00.620 --> 47:02.400]  Do we need to run up?
[47:02.880 --> 47:04.660]  I think you need to be sliding
[47:04.660 --> 47:05.920]  enough to make it go.
[47:07.840 --> 47:10.160]  To make the jump. You have to have some momentum
[47:10.160 --> 47:11.660]  behind you or it will not work.
[47:18.120 --> 47:18.560]  Alright.
[47:18.720 --> 47:20.060]  Don't you fucking push me!
[47:20.560 --> 47:21.540]  I'm not, sorry.
[47:23.320 --> 47:23.760]  Sorry.
[47:23.980 --> 47:25.000]  What the fuck are you doing, man?
[47:25.240 --> 47:27.740]  I'm getting bumped, I'm getting bumped.
[47:31.060 --> 47:32.460]  See, I didn't touch ya.
[47:32.860 --> 47:33.680]  Alright, go ahead, Geoff.
[47:36.360 --> 47:38.060]  Quickly now. Watch out for the spike!
[47:39.800 --> 47:41.320]  When you said look out for the spike,
[47:41.600 --> 47:42.960]  were you talking to you?
[47:43.220 --> 47:45.620]  No, I was talking to Andrew who forced me into the spike.
[47:45.620 --> 47:47.380]  I didn't hit the spike, I want it noted.
[47:47.880 --> 47:48.500]  Holy shit.
[47:48.920 --> 47:51.700]  20 anonymous subs for hitting that.
[47:51.860 --> 47:52.880]  Hey, thank you.
[47:53.540 --> 47:56.160]  We wrote thank you out at the end of this level.
[47:56.340 --> 47:57.240]  Stay tuned, you'll see it.
[47:57.540 --> 47:58.160]  Yeah, you'll see it.
[48:00.540 --> 48:00.980]  Boys.
[48:01.400 --> 48:03.660]  What are you doing?
[48:03.660 --> 48:04.100]  Boys.
[48:05.600 --> 48:08.620]  What are you idiots doing?
[48:09.580 --> 48:12.100]  You take the S off of that fucking word, sir.
[48:12.420 --> 48:15.180]  You take the S off of that shit right now.
[48:15.440 --> 48:15.860]  Boys.
[48:16.940 --> 48:18.960]  I may have given that one a little smack by accident.
[48:19.380 --> 48:20.260]  Yeah, a little smack.
[48:23.560 --> 48:26.200]  A wizard arrives precisely when he means to.
[48:26.860 --> 48:27.120]  Nice.
[48:27.300 --> 48:35.100]  Yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?
[48:37.140 --> 48:37.660]  All good.
[48:38.240 --> 48:38.940]  Fair play.
[48:39.280 --> 48:41.720]  I freaked out.
[48:44.240 --> 48:46.760]  We didn't even get to say thank you that time.
[48:46.940 --> 48:47.440]  Aw, man.
[48:48.080 --> 48:49.140]  I'm losing it.
[48:50.320 --> 48:52.020]  When did you ever have it?
[48:53.580 --> 48:55.900]  Before you read thank you.
[48:56.020 --> 48:56.840]  Oh, thanks for the shove.
[48:59.080 --> 49:00.860]  That shove traveled through the entire group.
[49:00.940 --> 49:02.160]  I think that was from the back, that one.
[49:02.960 --> 49:03.900]  Oh, I didn't touch anyone.
[49:03.900 --> 49:04.660]  Oh, really?
[49:04.960 --> 49:06.020]  Not all the back.
[49:08.180 --> 49:10.800]  I cannot wait to see the stats for this.
[49:10.880 --> 49:11.460]  I'm so excited.
[49:11.720 --> 49:12.140]  I'm thrilled.
[49:12.540 --> 49:15.920]  They're all being attributed to Gavin, so...
[49:15.920 --> 49:17.600]  What do you mean? Stop shoving me.
[49:18.280 --> 49:21.180]  Oh, my God.
[49:21.300 --> 49:21.620]  Boys.
[49:22.920 --> 49:26.320]  Nick and Gavin, if you guys are perfectly on each other,
[49:26.440 --> 49:27.480]  no one can climb up.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.400]  They need to be slightly askew.
[49:31.400 --> 49:33.220]  But only one person can affect that.
[49:33.980 --> 49:35.040]  Was that me?
[49:35.680 --> 49:36.420]  That's my fault.
[49:37.920 --> 49:38.980]  If that's my bad, my bad.
[49:39.060 --> 49:41.000]  The person underneath doesn't do anything about that.
[49:41.760 --> 49:43.880]  You're shoving the bejesus out of her.
[49:45.800 --> 49:47.800]  That was a great recovery, guys.
[49:48.340 --> 49:48.820]  Great job.
[49:49.500 --> 49:50.100]  We got it.
[49:56.700 --> 49:57.440]  Slow it down.
[49:58.080 --> 49:58.380]  Slow it down.
[49:59.440 --> 50:00.220]  Plenty of time.
[50:01.000 --> 50:01.820]  Tempo, you're alright.
[50:01.820 --> 50:03.400]  Here we go, boys.
[50:06.500 --> 50:07.340]  Well, I made it.
[50:07.720 --> 50:08.820]  Oh, my God.
[50:09.340 --> 50:11.440]  What does the rest of that say? We're never gonna know.
[50:12.760 --> 50:13.900]  The map is moving too slow.
[50:15.220 --> 50:16.880]  Seems like we probably could have done it there.
[50:19.200 --> 50:20.540]  I don't know why I say that.
[50:29.020 --> 50:29.600]  Good job.
[50:30.840 --> 50:31.540]  Slow it down.
[50:31.680 --> 50:32.060]  Slow it down.
[50:32.060 --> 50:33.020]  Slow it down.
[50:33.120 --> 50:34.900]  There you go.
[50:35.520 --> 50:36.940]  We got plenty of runway.
[50:37.700 --> 50:38.920]  You can see the whole thing in front of you.
[50:39.040 --> 50:40.660]  Just gotta slow it down. Easy tempo.
[50:40.840 --> 50:41.300]  You're alright.
[50:45.680 --> 50:46.900]  Give it time.
[50:47.260 --> 50:49.220]  You're not...
[50:49.220 --> 50:49.700]  Spike!
[50:52.080 --> 50:52.440]  Spike!
[50:54.280 --> 50:55.460]  Let me just...
[50:55.460 --> 50:57.320]  I'm at the door if anyone needs any help.
[50:57.820 --> 50:58.940]  Who got hit by the spike?
[51:00.120 --> 51:01.280]  Well, here's my thought.
[51:01.420 --> 51:03.140]  If you land on us, we might be able to
[51:03.140 --> 51:04.620]  temper your slide.
[51:06.420 --> 51:07.160]  I just jump over
[51:07.160 --> 51:07.580]  the spike.
[51:07.680 --> 51:10.700]  I didn't really have an issue getting on the other side of the spike.
[51:12.120 --> 51:12.840]  Okay, well...
[51:12.840 --> 51:14.200]  Gavin was pushed into it.
[51:15.520 --> 51:17.000]  The people that seem to be
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.060]  most concerned about alerting about the spike
[51:19.060 --> 51:21.120]  seem most prone to dying by the spike.
[51:21.300 --> 51:23.120]  To be fair, I was killed by you
[51:23.120 --> 51:25.020]  being pushed into the spike, which you did to
[51:25.020 --> 51:26.100]  Gavin just now.
[51:26.100 --> 51:28.360]  You didn't jump over it. You could've jumped it.
[51:28.500 --> 51:29.560]  I couldn't if I knew it was coming.
[51:29.780 --> 51:31.980]  We're waiting for the stage to catch up to it.
[51:31.980 --> 51:33.760]  News flash. The spike's coming.
[51:33.900 --> 51:35.720]  It's not going anywhere. It's always been there.
[51:36.980 --> 51:37.600]  Chill out.
[51:38.080 --> 51:40.220]  There's so much time. We need the space
[51:40.220 --> 51:40.820]  in front of us.
[51:41.760 --> 51:43.060]  We need the space in front of us.
[51:43.460 --> 51:46.060]  I got it. I got a good tempo here.
[51:46.160 --> 51:47.620]  Gavin, chill. Okay, let's go.
[51:48.060 --> 51:49.660]  Look at this. Nice and easy. See that?
[51:50.420 --> 51:51.180]  We'll go then.
[51:52.340 --> 51:53.860]  This is easy. We're good.
[51:55.180 --> 51:55.700]  Look.
[51:56.060 --> 51:56.460]  Nope.
[51:57.420 --> 51:57.940]  Yes!
[51:59.020 --> 52:00.120]  Andrew died anyway.
[52:00.460 --> 52:03.220]  I did that after for you.
[52:05.480 --> 52:07.240]  Let the record show Andrew also died.
[52:07.460 --> 52:08.600]  No, I did not.
[52:09.740 --> 52:10.500]  Were you reading, Geoff?
[52:17.880 --> 52:19.620]  I was trying to give him an L.
[52:20.380 --> 52:21.500]  Were you reading?
[52:21.580 --> 52:23.780]  It's so funny. I just suck at
[52:23.780 --> 52:25.560]  platforming, which is why I get angry
[52:25.560 --> 52:26.840]  when I do it properly.
[52:27.860 --> 52:29.700]  And somebody pulls some shit.
[52:30.540 --> 52:31.780]  Look, based on this,
[52:31.900 --> 52:33.360]  we never would have made it past the spike.
[52:33.720 --> 52:35.520]  Some of us didn't learn how to read today.
[52:35.920 --> 52:37.660]  That was me. Good adjustment. I'm sorry.
[52:37.840 --> 52:38.800]  Oh, you fuck.
[52:39.540 --> 52:40.400]  You can still do it.
[52:41.660 --> 52:42.920]  There was a movement.
[52:43.080 --> 52:44.500]  The flag was thrown, apparently.
[52:45.600 --> 52:46.460]  Towels were waved.
[52:48.640 --> 52:49.540]  This might be
[52:49.540 --> 52:51.120]  our top five streams.
[52:52.060 --> 52:53.060]  This is great.
[52:53.420 --> 52:54.740]  Top five longest streams.
[52:54.860 --> 52:56.020]  I have a feeling it might be.
[52:56.400 --> 52:58.720]  I love this one. I got no issues.
[52:59.200 --> 53:00.160]  I'm having fun.
[53:00.380 --> 53:02.120]  We'll see how everybody feels at 730.
[53:04.660 --> 53:05.400]  Nice job.
[53:07.320 --> 53:09.160]  Let that level catch up a little bit.
[53:09.300 --> 53:10.180]  There you go.
[53:10.680 --> 53:11.360]  Oh my god.
[53:12.400 --> 53:14.500]  Let's put Gavin and Geoff right next to each other.
[53:15.120 --> 53:16.260]  That should be good.
[53:17.200 --> 53:19.140]  Geoff, in your own time,
[53:19.140 --> 53:20.360]  don't shove me.
[53:22.580 --> 53:23.340]  Lovely stuff.
[53:23.460 --> 53:26.620]  Lovely shit.
[53:28.880 --> 53:29.680]  Get off me.
[53:30.140 --> 53:31.360]  Oh my god.
[53:31.640 --> 53:33.060]  That was me.
[53:34.740 --> 53:36.120]  I was through the fucking door.
[53:36.800 --> 53:38.040]  I had already left the level.
[53:38.240 --> 53:40.800]  I launched them out of the thing.
[53:41.060 --> 53:42.820]  I was in the goddamn green room.
[53:43.460 --> 53:45.100]  Nick made a great attempt to not fall
[53:45.100 --> 53:45.660]  into the end though.
[53:45.660 --> 53:47.560]  That was great by both of you.
[53:47.720 --> 53:49.280]  You both did a lot of good work there.
[53:49.340 --> 53:50.300]  That was all my fault.
[53:53.480 --> 53:54.380]  There you go. Let's do it, boys.
[53:55.020 --> 53:55.700]  Andrew got it.
[53:56.040 --> 53:58.140]  You're a little quick.
[53:58.700 --> 53:59.380]  Slow it down, buddy.
[54:01.240 --> 54:02.320]  Now we're in business.
[54:02.640 --> 54:03.900]  Look at that. Now we're in business.
[54:08.080 --> 54:08.760]  There we go.
[54:08.980 --> 54:09.500]  Oh my god.
[54:11.560 --> 54:11.900]  Okay.
[54:11.900 --> 54:12.740]  Okay.
[54:16.140 --> 54:17.360]  Thank you.
[54:17.460 --> 54:19.520]  We couldn't see all the words.
[54:20.720 --> 54:22.060]  We'll get there.
[54:24.640 --> 54:25.840]  Gavin, how are you feeling?
[54:26.400 --> 54:26.880]  Not great.
[54:27.860 --> 54:28.520]  Not now?
[54:29.160 --> 54:31.340]  I always.
[54:33.280 --> 54:33.760]  Well.
[54:34.160 --> 54:34.500]  Okay.
[54:35.220 --> 54:37.360]  Good adjustment.
[54:38.040 --> 54:38.400]  Thank you.
[54:38.400 --> 54:39.060]  Perfect.
[54:40.980 --> 54:41.380]  Relax!
[54:42.900 --> 54:43.520]  I'm fine.
[54:43.700 --> 54:45.900]  I just wanted to fall between the two of you.
[54:46.220 --> 54:46.620]  Fuck.
[54:49.920 --> 54:52.740]  You bounced back and forth longer than I would have guessed.
[54:53.400 --> 54:54.280]  That was impressive.
[54:55.260 --> 54:56.780]  I thought you were going to get out of it.
[55:00.260 --> 55:01.680]  None of us are getting out of this.
[55:01.960 --> 55:03.320]  Gifted subs, thank you so much.
[55:03.680 --> 55:04.180]  Thank you.
[55:09.300 --> 55:09.980]  Thank you.
[55:10.980 --> 55:13.160]  Get off me, you blue fucker.
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.620]  Stop making me laugh.
[55:17.260 --> 55:18.660]  Nobody's trying to make you laugh.
[55:19.480 --> 55:20.520]  Nobody's telling you jokes.
[55:20.640 --> 55:22.020]  These are jokes, dickhead.
[55:29.840 --> 55:30.400]  No!
[55:31.180 --> 55:32.840]  What are you doing?
[55:33.800 --> 55:34.240]  No!
[55:35.380 --> 55:36.000]  Yes!
[55:36.400 --> 55:37.020]  Why?
[55:37.820 --> 55:40.300]  Because we didn't have any runway!
[55:40.880 --> 55:42.120]  We're all so fucked!
[55:44.680 --> 55:45.580]  Here's the thing.
[55:45.700 --> 55:48.500]  It was you die, or Andrew or I die.
[55:48.640 --> 55:50.040]  It was going to happen either way.
[55:50.360 --> 55:51.180]  We were done!
[55:51.860 --> 55:52.800]  We were not done!
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.640]  The door was open!
[55:56.080 --> 55:57.400]  There was not enough time!
[56:00.980 --> 56:02.340]  Andrew, were we fucked?
[56:02.560 --> 56:04.380]  I don't know.
[56:05.120 --> 56:06.520]  I was just waiting.
[56:07.700 --> 56:08.280]  That's Andrew.
[56:09.460 --> 56:10.100]  That's Andrew.
[56:10.340 --> 56:12.100]  I can do it.
[56:12.460 --> 56:13.260]  Please do.
[56:15.100 --> 56:16.440]  What a recovery!
[56:16.860 --> 56:17.240]  That was awesome.
[56:18.140 --> 56:18.880]  Way to go!
[56:20.760 --> 56:21.520]  That was great, Gavin.
[56:21.900 --> 56:24.520]  Just chilling in the back.
[56:24.520 --> 56:25.760]  Let's build each other up.
[56:26.200 --> 56:31.680]  Go, go, go!
[56:33.400 --> 56:34.500]  Why are we so freaked out?
[56:34.580 --> 56:35.340]  We have so much time.
[56:35.440 --> 56:36.720]  Let's build Gavin up.
[56:36.860 --> 56:38.140]  We have to have the momentum.
[56:39.240 --> 56:40.720]  There's still a lot of time left.
[56:41.880 --> 56:42.280]  Tons.
[56:43.720 --> 56:46.000]  Let's build Gavin all the way up to the bouncy platform
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.360]  so he reaches it next time.
[56:50.660 --> 56:51.680]  Stop pushing.
[56:51.860 --> 56:52.360]  Gavin adjusted.
[56:52.860 --> 56:53.500]  We're good.
[56:57.700 --> 56:58.220]  Phenomenal.
[56:58.540 --> 56:59.680]  Going into the back.
[57:03.790 --> 57:05.310]  Get the fuck away from me.
[57:06.210 --> 57:06.730]  Awesome.
[57:09.310 --> 57:10.810]  Don't do a bit right now.
[57:10.890 --> 57:11.530]  We have to finish.
[57:12.670 --> 57:13.970]  Now Gavin wants to finish.
[57:14.730 --> 57:15.530]  What are you?
[57:20.520 --> 57:21.080]  Easy.
[57:22.000 --> 57:22.820]  So easy.
[57:23.040 --> 57:23.600]  Yeah!
[57:25.440 --> 57:26.320]  You have the opportunity
[57:26.320 --> 57:27.420]  to see the funniest thing.
[57:27.620 --> 57:28.960]  Go in the door.
[57:33.840 --> 57:35.520]  I'm so excited to see
[57:36.380 --> 57:38.740]  the death counter
[57:38.740 --> 57:39.480]  for this because
[57:40.220 --> 57:42.420]  I felt like I had hardly anything to do
[57:42.420 --> 57:43.640]  with everything that happened there.
[57:43.940 --> 57:47.100]  I was coasting on so much of that.
[57:47.100 --> 57:47.860]  Wow.
[57:48.240 --> 57:49.960]  That was crazy.
[57:51.400 --> 57:52.480]  Shall we just
[57:52.480 --> 57:54.080]  visit with the chat for like 3 minutes?
[57:54.360 --> 57:55.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[57:55.460 --> 57:56.680]  Let's see what's next.
[57:57.980 --> 57:59.380]  We'll have a look at all that stuff.
[58:02.240 --> 58:04.100]  We beat 4 levels
[58:04.100 --> 58:05.180]  and it took an hour.
[58:06.240 --> 58:08.740]  We beat 3 of them in 30 minutes
[58:08.740 --> 58:09.940]  and Geoff called it perfectly
[58:09.940 --> 58:12.160]  that it would take 30 more minutes after that.
[58:12.400 --> 58:13.460]  That was crazy.
[58:13.460 --> 58:15.320]  These are 3 of the hardest
[58:15.320 --> 58:16.500]  levels ever made though.
[58:17.100 --> 58:19.600]  Also, we hadn't yet dealt with the spike.
[58:20.480 --> 58:21.060]  That's true.
[58:21.300 --> 58:23.040]  We could have fallen to it.
[58:23.720 --> 58:24.120]  It's possible.
[58:24.940 --> 58:27.380]  We don't know that because you died before that.
[58:27.820 --> 58:28.060]  Yeah.
[58:28.800 --> 58:30.260]  Oh, it said thank you.
[58:31.540 --> 58:33.300]  I looked it up on YouTube
[58:33.300 --> 58:35.180]  and the words said thank you.
[58:39.440 --> 58:40.600]  Oh, active gamer?
[58:41.240 --> 58:43.660]  Are we active gaming?
[58:45.260 --> 58:47.540]  We got full spectrum warriors here.
[58:47.900 --> 58:52.800]  Wow, what a success story
[58:52.800 --> 58:54.000]  this game was for us.
[58:54.380 --> 58:56.720]  Just teamwork shining through, friendship.
[58:57.420 --> 58:58.620]  Just like as Nick said,
[58:58.760 --> 59:00.460]  just lifting each other up whenever
[59:00.460 --> 59:02.500]  somebody falls over and over and over again
[59:02.500 --> 59:03.580]  because they're fucking stupid.
[59:04.100 --> 59:06.200]  Just making each other feel
[59:07.220 --> 59:08.480]  worth it and
[59:08.480 --> 59:10.420]  valued and not like they're
[59:10.420 --> 59:12.020]  dragging the entire team
[59:12.020 --> 59:14.160]  and maybe even the
[59:14.160 --> 59:16.120]  fucking company down into the dirt,
[59:16.160 --> 59:18.240]  into the bean hole to just get
[59:18.240 --> 59:20.140]  fucking soggy with rain water
[59:20.140 --> 59:22.120]  and dirt and mud that collects in the bottom
[59:22.120 --> 59:24.140]  of the bean hole and then maybe a bird fell in
[59:24.140 --> 59:25.860]  and it couldn't get out because it had a broken wing
[59:25.860 --> 59:28.300]  so it fucking died there and then a bunch of ants came down
[59:28.300 --> 59:30.260]  and ate that and you'd think that we'd be in that too
[59:30.260 --> 59:32.140]  but we're not. We're pulling each other out of that
[59:32.140 --> 59:34.060]  bird hole. I'm looking
[59:34.060 --> 59:36.220]  at the chat for who was MVP today
[59:36.220 --> 59:38.120]  and baby Pepsi's in a commanding lead.
[59:38.260 --> 59:40.440]  I think that's the funniest thing and that's how you know
[59:40.440 --> 59:41.920]  you don't have to worry about chat votes.
[59:46.080 --> 59:48.040]  That's why when people go like, why don't you listen to the audience?
[59:48.320 --> 59:49.280]  That's the reason.
[59:50.120 --> 59:52.240]  All world mode levels have been cleared.
[59:52.380 --> 59:54.300]  Dark mode is now unlocked.
[59:54.980 --> 59:55.660]  Hell yeah.
[59:56.380 --> 59:57.720]  Finale my ass.
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.260]  Alright, let's have a look at what the dark mode
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:00.920]  levels have to do.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.200]  Let's have a look
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.460]  Let's have a look at what the dark mode levels
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.200]  are as we wrap this up. Game finished, returning
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.720]  to menu.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.120]  I'll type the thing.
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.620]  Is it the same code?
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.400]  Oh, I see.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.660]  Okay, hold on.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.300]  We're almost there, boys.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:22.800]  That's not it.
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:24.660]  Hold on.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.120]  God, my whole face and
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.160]  head hurts.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.100]  I'm laughing so much.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.020]  I'm pushing you and you're not going
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.840]  anywhere. That's crazy. Somebody said
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.000]  what the fuck happened to make OG Geoff appear? I think
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.400]  it's because my wife's out of town.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.840]  I don't quite know what to do with myself.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:43.960]  Holiday Hippie says
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.840]  you can play Towerfall online, multiplayer with Parsec.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.960]  I don't think I've used Parsec.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.240]  I use Parsec all the time.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.020]  Is it responsive? It's very
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.880]  responsive. I like it a lot.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.180]  We can give it a shot sometime. Alright, let's have a look
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.140]  at dark mode.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.080]  I think you just
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.060]  go into existing levels. You need to load into a dark mode
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.060]  lobby, Gavin. Did you just go into the
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.340]  normal level lobby?
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.060]  I remember
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.220]  when he deemed that he should be host of things.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:12.280]  Whoops.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.320]  Are you
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.980]  okay? You're gonna have to back out.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.200]  Connection loss.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.940]  Game hurts. Endless
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.500]  dark.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:22.640]  Okay.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.240]  What's our new number?
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.680]  Oh my god.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.900]  You gotta let us know the number.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.340]  There it is.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:31.420]  That's a lot.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.260]  It's
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.880]  501, baby!
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:37.660]  We made it!
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.340]  That's why we're gonna see
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.800]  what dark mode is all about.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.340]  Whoa!
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400]  We should see potentially if we just
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.260]  can ace the first level and then call it.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.680]  I agree. We should definitely try the
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.640]  first level. I think that's
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.560]  for a treat. That's a teaser trick
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.200]  for us. As soon as Andrew gets in here.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.200]  There he goes, baby.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.020]  Alright, Gavin, let's do it. Let's see.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.340]  Hello, Dark Park. Alright, let's give it a shot.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.240]  Alright.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.520]  601. Oh, it counts!
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.620]  It counts! What is this? Oh no.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.980]  Does it release it?
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.520]  Oh, it counts!
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.640]  Oh, it keeps track for us.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.380]  What did you
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.620]  think was gonna happen? I thought if we
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.020]  kept going it wouldn't hit us in the head.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.520]  Oh yeah? Maybe if you lightly step
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.920]  onto it and back.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.120]  Like that?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120]  Something like that?
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.580]  That's crazy. I've had my only death
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:40.900]  already.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.240]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.360]  Alright, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.560]  Should I walk forward and back? Let's see.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:50.500]  Ah!
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:51.580]  Oh!
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.720]  Whoa! So far
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.620]  the only one without a death is Eric.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560]  Okay, well let's...
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.080]  You killed us all.
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:01.920]  Yeah, well be careful.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.180]  Okay, Gavin.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.660]  Guys, I think this might just be the
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.900]  place to call it because it seems like we're about to get into it.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.680]  Why are you on
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.140]  top of me? Why are you on top...
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.060]  What are you doing?
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:18.140]  Whoa!
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.840]  Alright, if I can remember...
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.840]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.560]  There was a space...
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.540]  We're just gonna move.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.340]  Gavin, they're everywhere.
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.620]  There's also a gap here.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.080]  You didn't move!
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.940]  Oh, I see. It just is designed
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.680]  to hit us directly.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.080]  I'm sorry. I was still thinking about a thank you.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:44.540]  Hahaha!
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.000]  Alright, give everyone
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.100]  space back here.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.320]  Wait, do I
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:52.880]  have to move or not?
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.080]  No, you're fine. 3, 2, 1,
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.680]  move! Nice, Gavin.
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.300]  Oh boy, I don't like that.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:03.740]  I'll do it.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.120]  Okay, it says to
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.160]  do it. It's a trick.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.020]  Don't get tricked by it.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.980]  Just so we're clear,
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.300]  person keeping track,
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.660]  these deaths don't count.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.400]  This is us testing out the dark level
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.580]  to see what we're about to get into.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.900]  Next time, you can throw us in the bus.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.060]  This is pretend dark mode.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.800]  This is like before we all pressed start in Mario Party.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:25.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.700]  Alright, y'all ready?
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.320]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.140]  Alright, let me know when to go.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.020]  3, 2, 1.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.640]  Okay, ran right into Geoff.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.100]  Hahaha!
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.020]  Just to be clear,
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.120]  these do not count.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:46.420]  Hahaha!
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.240]  That person in the front
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.860]  just feels like they should be the one to get it.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.980]  Not happening, so...
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.760]  There you go.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.980]  Alright, Gavin, you're gonna
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:00.640]  count it off.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.000]  Let's split up!
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.520]  So we can all be moving when it happens.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.000]  3, 2, 1, press!
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:08.800]  Here we go.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.460]  Oh, you're too close.
[01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.670]  Remember when
[01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:16.230]  that one said, please press? That sucked.
[01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:18.130]  Oh, nice.
[01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.470]  It seemed like it was probably gonna be a trap, and then it was.
[01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:22.550]  We should split
[01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.110]  where two go left and two go right.
[01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:26.130]  I'm gonna go right.
[01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:27.390]  I'll go right.
[01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:28.790]  And then blue and red go left.
[01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:31.890]  Gavin, you start closer to...
[01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:33.570]  I'm sorry, Nick, you start closer to me, I think.
[01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:35.910]  Oh, no, no, no, you're fine. Okay, ready?
[01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.490]  It's gonna be on go.
[01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:39.390]  It's gonna be 3, 2, 1, go.
[01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:42.570]  3, 2, 1, go! Nice!
[01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:44.730]  I don't know how I died.
[01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:46.570]  I literally went...
[01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:46.890]  Literally?
[01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:51.050]  I don't want this to end with me on the most kills.
[01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:54.710]  That's unfortunate, because that's how the last mode ended.
[01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:57.870]  By default.
[01:05:58.690 --> 01:05:59.410]  Okay, y'all tell me.
[01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:00.710]  No, you tell us.
[01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.710]  Tell me when you're ready.
[01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:06.770]  3, 2, 1, go!
[01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:08.650]  Why would you walk to the right?
[01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.870]  You moron.
[01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.510]  Because I want to pull the screen away.
[01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:13.950]  What?
[01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:17.890]  What does that mean?
[01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:20.930]  If I go straight into the left side,
[01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:22.470]  I can't go anywhere.
[01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:23.650]  He'll hit a wall.
[01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:25.510]  He had so much room to go.
[01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:28.230]  Why don't you start on the wall, Gavin, and then move from there.
[01:06:28.850 --> 01:06:29.650]  The wall is...
[01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.990]  I'm gonna move right, green.
[01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.330]  If you want to go right next to me, I'll go right, you go left.
[01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:35.270]  Move a hair over, Gavin.
[01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.450]  Move a hair over.
[01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:38.670]  Me and Gavin are gonna run into each other again.
[01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:42.010]  3, 2, 1, go!
[01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:44.810]  I don't know why we wouldn't all go the same direction.
[01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:46.730]  The fact that we're going towards each other is insane.
[01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:48.550]  Because if we walk in the same direction,
[01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.450]  and I land where Geoff was,
[01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:53.190]  I'm gonna get hit by the thing that was falling to him.
[01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:54.470]  Well, sure.
[01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:59.010]  I just don't know why I talk to this guy.
[01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.790]  It's only gonna be one space over, though.
[01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:06.270]  Okay, let's all move to the right.
[01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:08.710]  Let's all move to the right.
[01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:09.950]  Whenever you're ready, Nick.
[01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:13.350]  Here we go. 3, 2, 1, go!
[01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:15.210]  I'm alive.
[01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.150]  I just didn't make it out of the way in time.
[01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.950]  Yeah, you tell him, Henry.
[01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:24.690]  Henry's dead. That's Albert.
[01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:27.450]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.770]  Albert's annoyed that we're still playing.
[01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:34.510]  Andrew's like, dude, I wanna go outside.
[01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:36.630]  We can't stuff ourselves.
[01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:38.690]  Andrew, we should stop.
[01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:40.550]  We're gonna...
[01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:42.490]  I like that we're ending on a high note.
[01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:43.810]  We're just gonna end in frustration.
[01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:45.250]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.790]  What if we stack up?
[01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:50.390]  What if we do two and two?
[01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:52.970]  And then red goes one way, blue goes the other,
[01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:53.490]  and then that's it.
[01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:56.810]  Alright, get in the middle of...
[01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:57.330]  I'll go left.
[01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.450]  Okay.
[01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:00.970]  Alright.
[01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.370]  3, 2, 1, go!
[01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:04.990]  Nice.
[01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:06.990]  Don't press this.
[01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:07.790]  It's a trick.
[01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:12.730]  Alright, well, thanks for watching the stream, guys.
[01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:13.590]  I'm done.
[01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:14.550]  I'm done.
[01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:15.810]  You walked right into it.
[01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:17.550]  Thank you guys so much.
[01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:19.810]  Thank you guys so much for watching the stream.
[01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:20.870]  Really appreciate it.
[01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.650]  Guys, this has been great.
[01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:25.150]  Don't forget to check it out on Tuesday,
[01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:26.090]  the podcast,
[01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:29.470]  and the gameplay channels at patreon.com
[01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:30.410]  slash regulation pod.
[01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:32.870]  Thank you so much for joining us,
[01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.890]  and we'll see you next time.
[01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:35.870]  Keep watching Mario Party.
[01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:37.710]  Don't forget to watch Mario Party.
[01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:40.570]  Don't forget to wake up tomorrow morning and play Mario Party, guys.
[01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:42.990]  Play Mario Party?
[01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:44.070]  Yeah, we have to.
[01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:46.570]  Oh, we do. What about Spring Forward?
[01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:47.310]  End!
[01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:50.270]  No need to tail sync.
[01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:53.350]  Nah, we probably shouldn't.
