[00:03.080 --> 00:04.040]  What happened?!
[00:04.040 --> 00:05.460]  Hey everybody!
[00:06.080 --> 00:08.620]  What is going on?!
[00:08.620 --> 00:10.280]  Oh, everything's exploding!
[00:10.600 --> 00:11.520]  What's happening?!
[00:11.520 --> 00:13.740]  Nick, unlock your car! I got four stars!
[00:14.020 --> 00:15.520]  Unlock the frickin' car, Nick!
[00:15.880 --> 00:17.360]  Nick, let me in the car!
[00:17.500 --> 00:19.960]  I don't think Nick is in here. Nick is still muted.
[00:20.580 --> 00:22.780]  It said that Nick left the game.
[00:23.340 --> 00:23.760]  Oh no!
[00:23.760 --> 00:25.920]  I didn't leave on purpose! It kicked me for being idle!
[00:26.400 --> 00:26.580]  Ah!
[00:28.940 --> 00:30.780]  You were just right back to my apartment!
[00:30.780 --> 00:32.740]  Unmuted in the beginning of the video.
[00:32.820 --> 00:35.840]  I watched Gavin's body. It disappeared.
[00:36.320 --> 00:37.120]  Rest in peace, Gavin.
[00:38.760 --> 00:40.120]  Rest in peace, Gavin.
[00:40.700 --> 00:42.180]  Andrew, you wanna do set up three?
[00:42.980 --> 00:43.080]  Yeah.
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.960]  Invite Nick to the game.
[00:45.300 --> 00:46.080]  I already did.
[00:47.040 --> 00:49.320]  Alright, we're off to the police station.
[00:50.600 --> 00:51.720]  Alright, Gavin, I'm with you.
[00:52.420 --> 00:53.000]  Alright, let's do it.
[00:53.120 --> 00:53.920]  Which one's yours, Nick?
[00:55.060 --> 00:56.080]  We're taking this truck?
[00:56.440 --> 00:57.920]  Why do I own this?
[00:57.920 --> 00:59.400]  I don't know. You picked it.
[00:59.700 --> 01:01.540]  I was expecting it to be all customed out.
[01:02.320 --> 01:04.520]  No, it's just a truck. It's just a mean-looking truck.
[01:04.740 --> 01:06.300]  Can you close my door? Thank you.
[01:06.680 --> 01:07.760]  Where the hell are we supposed to go?
[01:08.360 --> 01:09.380]  I don't know. I'm waiting.
[01:11.060 --> 01:11.600]  Okay, here we go.
[01:11.940 --> 01:14.360]  Alright, so we're going to the cargo ship. You're going to the...
[01:14.360 --> 01:15.360]  Police station?
[01:15.580 --> 01:17.100]  I can go get a schedule.
[01:18.580 --> 01:19.360]  Slop, slop!
[01:21.420 --> 01:22.140]  Oh God!
[01:26.400 --> 01:27.200]  Shut up!
[01:27.440 --> 01:28.060]  Where are we going?
[01:29.840 --> 01:30.780]  Let's give this a waypoint.
[01:31.260 --> 01:32.980]  Oh, we have to steal a cop car, Andrew.
[01:34.100 --> 01:34.540]  Oh, we do?
[01:34.760 --> 01:34.900]  Yeah.
[01:36.660 --> 01:38.740]  Gavin is on a mission to destroy
[01:38.740 --> 01:40.380]  every scooter he sees.
[01:40.800 --> 01:42.040]  Wait, do you not do that?
[01:42.240 --> 01:44.540]  Do you play GTA and not run over the bikers?
[01:44.700 --> 01:46.640]  I mean, I'm trying to just beat the mission.
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.160]  I have an idea.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.120]  Yeah, I have an idea too.
[01:50.540 --> 01:50.760]  Yeah?
[01:50.760 --> 01:50.800]  Yeah.
[01:54.100 --> 01:54.500]  Huh.
[01:57.740 --> 01:58.400]  I mean, that's one.
[01:59.100 --> 01:59.720]  Yeah, one.
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.900]  We're kind of working together.
[02:03.360 --> 02:03.780]  On this.
[02:05.080 --> 02:06.740]  Okay, we got it.
[02:08.880 --> 02:09.300]  Well, Nick,
[02:09.600 --> 02:11.480]  his idea to some of the police is murdering
[02:11.480 --> 02:13.580]  civilians. Mine was to just call the police.
[02:13.600 --> 02:14.220]  Call the police.
[02:14.700 --> 02:17.020]  Well, I wish I had done that now.
[02:17.780 --> 02:19.340]  Well, you should have been open to ideas.
[02:19.880 --> 02:21.640]  Well, here's the thing about ideas.
[02:21.920 --> 02:22.640]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:22.740 --> 02:23.740]  There are no bad ones.
[02:24.620 --> 02:26.480]  I think yours might not have been good.
[02:27.220 --> 02:28.640]  Well, tell that to those two people.
[02:29.300 --> 02:30.160]  The dead ones?
[02:31.060 --> 02:31.840]  I'd try.
[02:34.080 --> 02:34.740]  Alright, Andrew.
[02:34.800 --> 02:36.000]  We're gonna have to shoot these two.
[02:37.320 --> 02:38.340]  Do we have to?
[02:38.660 --> 02:39.740]  I don't think we have to.
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.160]  I think we can just take it.
[02:41.560 --> 02:42.800]  We're just homies in a car.
[02:43.860 --> 02:45.120]  We're just like seeing the sights.
[02:45.120 --> 02:46.620]  Nick is really trigger happy.
[02:47.260 --> 02:49.460]  We're just listening to music and...
[02:49.460 --> 02:51.700]  Andrew, you ran me over with a cop car!
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.060]  We got our sunnies on.
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.440]  I bumped you with it.
[02:54.460 --> 02:56.620]  We're talking about maybe stopping for some food.
[02:58.860 --> 03:00.960]  We're gonna go to Cluckin Bell or whatever.
[03:01.100 --> 03:02.000]  What's the GTA 4 one?
[03:02.900 --> 03:04.680]  Big Shot Burger or something?
[03:05.400 --> 03:06.260]  Freckle Bitches?
[03:07.540 --> 03:08.960]  Number 4, Extra Cheese.
[03:11.720 --> 03:12.460]  We are.
[03:15.700 --> 03:16.760]  Oh, that's bad.
[03:18.880 --> 03:19.980]  There's just no winning.
[03:22.180 --> 03:24.460]  I wonder if I should hit the brakes around this corner.
[03:25.100 --> 03:26.120]  Floor it to the...
[03:28.220 --> 03:29.580]  I'm in cinematic mode.
[03:29.700 --> 03:32.220]  It just looks so good when you're right into the pillar.
[03:33.280 --> 03:33.680]  Well...
[03:33.680 --> 03:34.660]  I went as long as I could.
[03:34.780 --> 03:36.020]  You did what you could.
[03:37.620 --> 03:39.180]  The helicopter is gonna be the problem.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.660]  Maybe I shouldn't have shot the cops.
[03:44.540 --> 03:46.060]  You know, I don't think that hurt.
[03:46.860 --> 03:47.860]  I think that was indifference.
[03:48.120 --> 03:48.520]  You know what?
[03:49.000 --> 03:49.860]  I think it was about the same.
[03:50.080 --> 03:50.640]  No bad ideas.
[03:54.140 --> 03:56.080]  Go through the fucking hills.
[03:56.360 --> 03:57.240]  Alright, Team Tape, let's go.
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.480]  Yeah, we gotta climb something, right?
[03:59.760 --> 04:00.380]  We climb this?
[04:01.200 --> 04:03.280]  Is there like a tunnel we could drive under?
[04:03.340 --> 04:07.040]  What is the best way to get rid of this helicopter?
[04:07.360 --> 04:08.320]  Let's go, Team Tape, Gavin.
[04:08.440 --> 04:08.800]  We got this.
[04:08.920 --> 04:10.580]  Team Tape, I have begun operation.
[04:10.580 --> 04:11.420]  What's your team name, guys?
[04:14.340 --> 04:15.060]  Team Ideas.
[04:15.080 --> 04:16.740]  We're Team Ideas.
[04:16.920 --> 04:18.360]  No bad ideas.
[04:18.780 --> 04:22.040]  Gavin, I don't think this is where we're supposed to go.
[04:22.140 --> 04:23.420]  Oh, no, we have to go up here.
[04:23.500 --> 04:24.860]  We have to control this thing, huh?
[04:25.020 --> 04:26.400]  And grab the car?
[04:27.440 --> 04:28.360]  I don't know.
[04:28.540 --> 04:31.400]  I feel like if we're gonna start killing people, it's better to have the high ground.
[04:31.680 --> 04:33.640]  Yeah, I don't think we're supposed to kill people yet, though.
[04:33.760 --> 04:34.440]  I think we're supposed to...
[04:34.440 --> 04:36.840]  That's what I learned from Obi-Wan.
[04:37.600 --> 04:38.020]  I don't know.
[04:41.610 --> 04:43.610]  Go to the container.
[04:44.750 --> 04:45.590]  Jesus Christ.
[04:45.710 --> 04:48.690]  Should we just jump, or should we shoot first?
[04:49.030 --> 04:49.790]  I don't know.
[04:51.170 --> 04:52.210]  Just one sec.
[04:52.610 --> 04:53.050]  What are you doing?
[04:55.690 --> 04:58.730]  I would say take him out with the silenced weapon, because I don't have anything like that.
[05:00.570 --> 05:01.310]  All my shit's allowed.
[05:02.410 --> 05:04.250]  I don't think I can aim that far down.
[05:04.250 --> 05:04.670]  You wanna get in?
[05:05.450 --> 05:06.470]  Oh, here we go.
[05:07.730 --> 05:09.510]  Alright, so I can just plug this guy's head.
[05:09.610 --> 05:10.270]  I think.
[05:10.930 --> 05:12.250]  Ready, set, go!
[05:12.590 --> 05:13.430]  Hit the other one.
[05:15.170 --> 05:16.150]  I can't aim that far down.
[05:16.530 --> 05:18.870]  I think maybe that's the end of us.
[05:20.210 --> 05:22.710]  I think we just gotta go down there and do it.
[05:23.270 --> 05:23.890]  Let's go!
[05:27.350 --> 05:28.710]  Ow! Shit!
[05:29.810 --> 05:30.150]  How'd we do?
[05:30.190 --> 05:32.010]  No bad ideas.
[05:32.650 --> 05:33.470]  No bad ideas.
[05:33.970 --> 05:34.890]  Should we block?
[05:35.370 --> 05:36.610]  This might be a bad idea.
[05:38.950 --> 05:39.910]  No bad ideas.
[05:39.910 --> 05:41.430]  What the fuck do you have?
[05:43.090 --> 05:45.010]  You just had like a...
[05:45.010 --> 05:46.690]  Just like a laser gallon gun.
[05:46.710 --> 05:47.590]  Yeah, that was sick.
[05:48.110 --> 05:49.010]  Who's driving? You?
[05:49.090 --> 05:49.770]  Me, I guess.
[05:50.270 --> 05:50.750]  Where?
[05:53.030 --> 05:54.290]  Oh my God!
[05:56.550 --> 05:57.770]  Alright, take it to the drop point.
[05:58.130 --> 05:59.830]  Sweet, good job.
[06:00.310 --> 06:00.990]  Oh no.
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.990]  No bad ideas.
[06:02.990 --> 06:03.650]  Turn this thing around.
[06:05.090 --> 06:06.690]  Police station, we're close.
[06:06.890 --> 06:08.750]  I've been playing way too much GTA 4.
[06:08.870 --> 06:09.810]  This feels so different.
[06:11.750 --> 06:13.450]  Good different? Bad different?
[06:13.850 --> 06:14.870]  Weird different.
[06:15.530 --> 06:17.690]  I think you're coming around on GTA 4 physics.
[06:17.770 --> 06:18.210]  I don't know about that.
[06:18.430 --> 06:19.750]  Oh my God!
[06:25.360 --> 06:25.860]  Yeah!
[06:26.440 --> 06:28.240]  Around here and then take a little left.
[06:28.760 --> 06:30.600]  I don't know why we're getting XP.
[06:30.600 --> 06:32.640]  Oh, because we're killing people.
[06:33.500 --> 06:34.180]  Got it.
[06:34.460 --> 06:36.260]  Enjoy the experience.
[06:39.440 --> 06:40.240]  Oh no.
[06:40.700 --> 06:42.180]  Oh my God, we're stuck.
[06:42.800 --> 06:43.280]  We're stuck.
[06:45.300 --> 06:46.480]  There's nowhere to go.
[06:47.320 --> 06:48.780]  What do you mean there's nowhere to go?
[06:48.800 --> 06:49.420]  How about the road?
[06:50.160 --> 06:52.340]  You see the way I'm going left and right?
[06:53.020 --> 06:54.080]  I'm going round and round.
[06:57.680 --> 06:59.840]  I don't want to rush you, Nick.
[06:59.840 --> 07:03.240]  But if we can get there as soon as possible so we checkpoint, I'm hoping.
[07:04.340 --> 07:06.280]  So if they die, it doesn't fuck us.
[07:06.480 --> 07:06.900]  You know what?
[07:07.020 --> 07:07.560]  It's a great idea.
[07:07.900 --> 07:08.820]  You're worried about us dying.
[07:09.660 --> 07:10.380]  We're not going to die.
[07:10.440 --> 07:11.000]  Sure are.
[07:11.100 --> 07:13.860]  We're going to get there way before you.
[07:15.020 --> 07:16.980]  We haven't even gotten to the police station yet.
[07:17.020 --> 07:18.320]  I also don't know where we're going.
[07:18.540 --> 07:19.140]  I'm just driving.
[07:20.560 --> 07:21.980]  Should I not be shooting them?
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.480]  I don't know.
[07:24.080 --> 07:25.300]  They're trying to kill us a little bit.
[07:25.300 --> 07:27.060]  We're way ahead of them.
[07:29.020 --> 07:29.660]  Alright.
[07:33.680 --> 07:36.520]  That's such a specific thing to get stuck in.
[07:38.100 --> 07:40.460]  It's all designed to trap cars.
[07:40.780 --> 07:42.420]  Is there a pay-in spray?
[07:42.580 --> 07:43.800]  What the fuck it's called?
[07:44.500 --> 07:45.800]  Uh, no.
[07:50.020 --> 07:52.380]  You think they might notice
[07:52.380 --> 07:54.100]  that there's something maybe irregular
[07:54.100 --> 07:55.300]  about this cop car?
[07:56.140 --> 07:58.100]  I couldn't possibly know what you're talking about.
[07:58.960 --> 08:00.100]  Gavin, this is bad.
[08:00.660 --> 08:01.840]  Gavin, this is bad.
[08:02.380 --> 08:03.260]  Gavin, this is bad.
[08:03.760 --> 08:04.740]  You've got to lose the fuzz.
[08:07.800 --> 08:09.140]  I think as long as these guys
[08:09.140 --> 08:10.400]  are coming after us to try to kill us,
[08:10.460 --> 08:11.380]  the cops are going to keep coming.
[08:13.220 --> 08:13.540]  Okay.
[08:13.620 --> 08:14.420]  Especially with you shooting.
[08:15.000 --> 08:15.600]  I'll stop shooting.
[08:17.700 --> 08:18.660]  Maybe they're gone.
[08:18.860 --> 08:19.220]  Oh, cool.
[08:19.220 --> 08:21.020]  Just take a weird pause.
[08:21.440 --> 08:22.180]  Go somewhere weird.
[08:24.020 --> 08:25.080]  Keep it low.
[08:25.420 --> 08:25.780]  Nice.
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.160]  We're almost there.
[08:30.040 --> 08:30.960]  I wonder if it'll just say,
[08:31.120 --> 08:31.840]  now wait for them.
[08:33.420 --> 08:35.180]  I think we'll be up.
[08:35.420 --> 08:36.980]  I think this is supposed to happen simultaneously.
[08:38.040 --> 08:38.240]  Okay.
[08:45.640 --> 08:46.420]  Good job.
[08:47.220 --> 08:47.700]  Inconspicuous.
[08:48.180 --> 08:49.560]  Steal the prison bus schedule.
[08:51.420 --> 08:52.960]  Yeah, how do I...
[08:53.660 --> 08:55.400]  Hold the left bumper and then down.
[08:56.720 --> 08:57.720]  Gavin, it's so tense.
[08:58.920 --> 08:59.880]  It's so tense.
[09:03.120 --> 09:03.860]  This is way better.
[09:03.860 --> 09:04.180]  Yes!
[09:08.900 --> 09:10.040]  Goddamn, that was crazy.
[09:10.420 --> 09:12.180]  Now you just got to get out of the LA river.
[09:12.280 --> 09:13.880]  How the fuck do I get out of here?
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.340]  Let's get back in the car.
[09:16.840 --> 09:17.680]  Is there an out?
[09:18.500 --> 09:18.820]  Yeah.
[09:19.860 --> 09:21.320]  You have to keep...
[09:23.000 --> 09:23.440]  looking.
[09:25.440 --> 09:26.580]  That's your advice.
[09:26.900 --> 09:28.000]  That's your advice.
[09:28.240 --> 09:30.720]  Why don't you come up that much steeper angle
[09:30.720 --> 09:31.920]  and get a wangle around.
[09:32.200 --> 09:32.820]  You think so?
[09:35.300 --> 09:36.100]  Uh oh.
[09:36.160 --> 09:37.220]  Yeah, you just go straight up there.
[09:37.500 --> 09:38.000]  We're swimming.
[09:39.540 --> 09:40.200]  I think that...
[09:40.200 --> 09:42.040]  I don't know that we can go up.
[09:42.980 --> 09:43.720]  There we go.
[09:45.520 --> 09:46.260]  There you go.
[09:48.520 --> 09:51.140]  Team NBI is crushing y'all.
[09:51.640 --> 09:53.840]  You think you're crushing Team Tape? Get real.
[09:54.140 --> 09:56.180]  Oh, Team Tape is way behind.
[09:56.300 --> 09:57.180]  This is Team Tape, baby.
[09:57.500 --> 09:58.980]  This is like second hand tape.
[10:00.140 --> 10:01.600]  You ain't sticky or nothing.
[10:02.120 --> 10:04.080]  I'm already thinking about merch for Team Tape.
[10:04.420 --> 10:04.520]  Yeah.
[10:05.920 --> 10:07.080]  We don't even have a store.
[10:09.160 --> 10:09.580]  Oh, alright.
[10:09.660 --> 10:11.920]  We got this. No bad ideas. Notepad. Bam.
[10:12.060 --> 10:13.460]  No bad ideas.
[10:14.500 --> 10:15.940]  Is about to wrap this up.
[10:16.000 --> 10:16.840]  We're just going to be waiting.
[10:17.820 --> 10:19.080]  Waiting for this tape to stick.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.540]  Team Tape have seen some shit.
[10:23.420 --> 10:24.140]  Three stars.
[10:24.900 --> 10:25.620]  Paramilitary groups.
[10:26.360 --> 10:27.800]  White car out of nowhere.
[10:32.240 --> 10:33.660]  And all we had was a pistol
[10:33.660 --> 10:34.540]  to deal with it.
[10:36.200 --> 10:36.780]  Right, Andrew?
[10:37.740 --> 10:39.200]  Destroy the police cruiser.
[10:39.340 --> 10:40.560]  I was going to say kill them, but don't kill them.
[10:40.780 --> 10:42.480]  We're just going to get back in the situation we were in.
[10:42.860 --> 10:43.840]  And I don't want to hear it from them.
[10:44.380 --> 10:46.480]  I'm not going to mention anything bad that you do, Eric,
[10:46.520 --> 10:50.100]  because I want the other team to think Team Tape just has it all down.
[10:50.580 --> 10:52.840]  Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
[10:52.900 --> 10:53.780]  This is going swimmingly.
[10:54.180 --> 10:55.860]  Well done on a tremendous setup.
[10:56.100 --> 10:57.140]  Thanks, bud.
[11:00.620 --> 11:02.160]  Andrew, you want to trail out this way, Nick?
[11:02.460 --> 11:02.680]  Yeah.
[11:05.320 --> 11:06.680]  Hey, you think I should be walking
[11:06.680 --> 11:08.500]  the opposite of the way I'm pouring this?
[11:09.800 --> 11:10.860]  I would say so.
[11:11.000 --> 11:11.680]  Probably a good idea.
[11:12.760 --> 11:12.980]  Okay.
[11:14.340 --> 11:15.020]  You ready?
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.560]  Yeah. Are we shooting it or what?
[11:18.200 --> 11:18.680]  Yep.
[11:20.520 --> 11:22.300]  What do you think they're doing, Gavin?
[11:23.080 --> 11:23.740]  Got it.
[11:24.040 --> 11:25.260]  I have no idea.
[11:25.380 --> 11:27.320]  We got Ghost Rider.
[11:28.260 --> 11:30.280]  Oh, we got the Ghost Rider thing.
[11:30.380 --> 11:31.640]  Oh, we should have put our initials.
[11:31.940 --> 11:32.420]  NBA.
[11:33.220 --> 11:33.680]  NBA.
[11:36.300 --> 11:39.720]  Eric, I think the next time Team Tape rides again,
[11:40.040 --> 11:41.460]  we should just stand around
[11:41.460 --> 11:42.920]  and pretend like we're doing the mission.
[11:43.280 --> 11:43.640]  I agree.
[11:44.280 --> 11:45.040]  I'm with you.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.880]  You want to drive or should I?
[11:48.320 --> 11:49.320]  No one's driving.
[11:49.340 --> 11:50.140]  No bad ideas, man.
[11:52.280 --> 11:53.480]  It sucks.
[11:54.460 --> 11:54.860]  No idea.
[11:55.560 --> 11:56.240]  No ideas.
[11:57.880 --> 11:59.160]  That's my spin-off.
[11:59.460 --> 12:00.320]  That's just me.
[12:01.040 --> 12:02.420]  That's me by myself.
[12:05.520 --> 12:07.380]  So Nick just brings bad?
[12:07.880 --> 12:08.480]  Yeah.
[12:09.080 --> 12:09.820]  Wait, no!
[12:10.340 --> 12:14.080]  But combined, it completely flips
[12:14.080 --> 12:14.920]  into a positive.
[12:16.020 --> 12:17.240]  Individually, we suck.
[12:18.640 --> 12:19.680]  Individually, disaster.
[12:20.080 --> 12:21.420]  No ideas and bad.
[12:21.820 --> 12:23.180]  But no bad ideas?
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.720]  We're killing it. Geniuses.
[12:26.020 --> 12:26.420]  Hell yeah.
[12:28.140 --> 12:29.460]  We're already done with the movie?
[12:29.580 --> 12:30.240]  We're just flying in?
[12:30.300 --> 12:31.140]  What are you guys doing?
[12:31.480 --> 12:32.860]  Still ditching the cops?
[12:33.440 --> 12:38.100]  We actually dropped off the car about five minutes ago.
[12:38.400 --> 12:39.920]  We're hanging out.
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.340]  Gavin's actually trying to hit all the buttons
[12:41.340 --> 12:43.300]  to do a backflip in the game.
[12:43.920 --> 12:46.240]  Gavin's hitting all the buttons, Nick's hitting all the walls.
[12:46.700 --> 12:48.600]  Listen, we got stuff going on over here, too.
[12:48.880 --> 12:50.200]  That was more backflips than Alyssa.
[12:51.500 --> 12:52.660]  I wouldn't know!
[12:54.580 --> 12:55.380]  You sound upset.
[12:56.680 --> 12:57.040]  What?
[12:59.800 --> 13:02.240]  Is that a pool reference, Gavin?
[13:02.680 --> 13:03.460]  Talking about swimming?
[13:04.580 --> 13:04.820]  You know.
[13:06.180 --> 13:07.940]  Okay, wait, so now what?
[13:08.120 --> 13:09.200]  So now we're just hanging out.
[13:10.220 --> 13:12.300]  Now it says, uh, help the other team
[13:12.300 --> 13:13.260]  with their duties.
[13:13.560 --> 13:16.160]  We already did our stuff and now it's telling us
[13:16.160 --> 13:17.960]  no bad ideas.
[13:18.360 --> 13:19.860]  Alright, I'll just circle back
[13:19.860 --> 13:20.860]  now that we're done waiting.
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.340]  They've, you know,
[13:23.580 --> 13:26.260]  they gave us eight jobs to do
[13:26.260 --> 13:27.700]  because of, uh...
[13:27.700 --> 13:29.300]  God, dude, there's so far.
[13:29.640 --> 13:31.720]  I mean, there's a checkpoint
[13:31.720 --> 13:33.600]  if you want to use it, or a waypoint.
[13:33.940 --> 13:34.740]  Handfuls of feet.
[13:35.880 --> 13:37.500]  I'm just gonna look for a plane.
[13:37.500 --> 13:39.260]  Did you say handfuls of feet?
[13:40.000 --> 13:40.440]  Yep.
[13:42.860 --> 13:43.720]  Handfuls of feet.
[13:43.920 --> 13:45.320]  Feet by the handfills.
[13:47.440 --> 13:47.960]  Handfills?
[13:48.620 --> 13:48.940]  Are we done?
[13:49.420 --> 13:50.300]  A feet?
[13:51.300 --> 13:53.780]  A feet! There are enough feet
[13:53.780 --> 13:55.060]  that you can hold in your hands.
[13:55.480 --> 13:56.620]  There's so few feet.
[13:56.900 --> 13:57.740]  Two feet!
[13:59.600 --> 14:00.660]  By the handful.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.720]  By the handful he's sucking toes.
[14:03.180 --> 14:05.040]  No, that's Nick when he's by himself.
[14:05.800 --> 14:06.880]  Oh, that's bad.
[14:07.060 --> 14:08.100]  There's no plane?
[14:08.840 --> 14:09.340]  There's no plane.
[14:11.140 --> 14:12.100]  We did it.
[14:12.680 --> 14:13.220]  No!
[14:16.260 --> 14:16.800]  No!
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.120]  That's wrong.
[14:18.300 --> 14:19.780]  That is wrong.
[14:20.480 --> 14:22.320]  Platinum, Eric, gold, Gavin.
[14:23.180 --> 14:24.240]  That's wrong.
[14:25.640 --> 14:27.240]  Team tape, top of the podium.
[14:27.880 --> 14:28.460]  That's what I'm saying.
[14:29.800 --> 14:30.340]  Please.
[14:30.900 --> 14:33.100]  Get your team tape shirt now at our store.
[14:33.100 --> 14:34.120]  Level 12!
[14:35.100 --> 14:37.320]  If it weren't for some adhesive, you'd just be a bunch of scrubs.
[14:39.720 --> 14:42.100]  Okay, we gotta break Rakowski out of
[14:42.100 --> 14:43.000]  Bolingbroke.
[14:43.400 --> 14:45.760]  Ground team takes the transport bus, poses as guards
[14:45.760 --> 14:47.920]  and inmate, and goes into the prison to get him out.
[14:48.720 --> 14:49.840]  Demolitions takes care
[14:49.840 --> 14:51.580]  of the inbound transport bus.
[14:51.980 --> 14:53.500]  Pilot collects them in the plane.
[14:53.640 --> 14:53.880]  Love it.
[14:55.840 --> 14:57.120]  Good luck, tape.
[14:58.420 --> 14:59.380]  Good luck.
[14:59.700 --> 15:01.060]  We're looking swish.
[15:01.060 --> 15:02.380]  Yeah, this is good.
[15:05.180 --> 15:07.860]  Alright, Gavin, me and you.
[15:09.540 --> 15:12.500]  Let me test out my gun first.
[15:13.740 --> 15:14.740]  Holy shit!
[15:14.900 --> 15:16.040]  Okay, that's pretty cool.
[15:19.500 --> 15:20.360]  Let's do it, bud.
[15:21.680 --> 15:22.280]  You animals!
[15:22.680 --> 15:23.480]  What are you doing?
[15:25.760 --> 15:27.140]  What are you doing?
[15:27.180 --> 15:27.800]  Fuck that bike.
[15:27.800 --> 15:28.960]  No bad ideas.
[15:33.340 --> 15:36.460]  I love horses, let's go.
[15:36.820 --> 15:38.220]  Just bad people, you know what I'm saying?
[15:39.160 --> 15:40.580]  No, no bad ideas.
[15:40.780 --> 15:41.660]  Not no bad people.
[15:43.620 --> 15:48.280]  Oh, we have to climb a rooftop
[15:49.100 --> 15:49.580]  ladder.
[15:52.080 --> 15:54.400]  I'm treating this like it's the Halo 2 speedrun
[15:54.400 --> 15:55.260]  between Gavin and I.
[15:55.580 --> 15:57.880]  Oh, Gavin's locked in too.
[15:58.420 --> 16:00.080]  I'm doing Formula 1 lines.
[16:00.180 --> 16:00.800]  I'm taking shortcuts.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.380]  I'm attempting shortcuts.
[16:06.640 --> 16:08.040]  That was an awesome shortcut, Gavin.
[16:08.840 --> 16:10.080]  That was an awesome shortcut.
[16:10.560 --> 16:10.860]  Team tape.
[16:11.620 --> 16:12.660]  Team tape.
[16:13.680 --> 16:15.660]  We made some serious ground.
[16:16.600 --> 16:18.700]  When we flew over that...
[16:18.700 --> 16:19.120]  Team tape.
[16:19.560 --> 16:21.800]  When we went straight over the fence and the pool
[16:21.800 --> 16:23.200]  and landed on the road on the other side.
[16:24.820 --> 16:27.200]  I mean, we're doing better than y'all are,
[16:27.200 --> 16:28.180]  but that did sound cool.
[16:28.940 --> 16:30.660]  That's what I'm saying, because it was cool.
[16:31.320 --> 16:31.860]  Team tape.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.020]  Alright, we need some sniper rifles here.
[16:36.920 --> 16:37.640]  Yeah, I'm
[16:38.500 --> 16:39.300]  sniping position.
[16:40.320 --> 16:41.900]  Okay, I'm gonna get to my vantage point.
[16:42.420 --> 16:43.420]  Yeah, you gotta get over here.
[16:44.080 --> 16:46.020]  Alright, so we...
[16:46.020 --> 16:47.060]  Did we make it?
[16:50.320 --> 16:51.660]  Wait for the prosecutors to arrive.
[16:51.660 --> 16:54.220]  Forward and back on the D-pad to zoom in if your sniper can.
[16:54.540 --> 16:55.080]  Thank you.
[16:57.860 --> 16:58.500]  Alright.
[17:01.660 --> 17:03.040]  Think this might be them?
[17:04.260 --> 17:05.800]  Uh, hold on.
[17:06.340 --> 17:07.840]  Let's synchronize our shots.
[17:07.960 --> 17:09.080]  Do you want the top guy or the other guy?
[17:09.080 --> 17:10.020]  I got the left guy.
[17:10.880 --> 17:11.520]  Ready?
[17:14.460 --> 17:15.740]  3, 2,
[17:16.060 --> 17:17.100]  1, go.
[17:18.360 --> 17:19.000]  Beautiful.
[17:19.400 --> 17:20.380]  Nicely done.
[17:20.980 --> 17:22.920]  I don't see guys.
[17:24.260 --> 17:25.740]  I saw that.
[17:26.760 --> 17:27.520]  Oh shit.
[17:27.660 --> 17:29.340]  Get in the armored car.
[17:31.440 --> 17:31.840]  Fuck.
[17:32.140 --> 17:32.640]  Oh shit.
[17:33.560 --> 17:34.040]  I'm alright.
[17:35.940 --> 17:36.960]  I see a guy.
[17:37.340 --> 17:38.020]  I'm in the car.
[17:40.500 --> 17:41.300]  What happened?
[17:41.640 --> 17:42.300]  Alright, get in quick.
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.880]  Oh shit, they're swarming it.
[17:45.920 --> 17:47.260]  So we're just gonna plow through them, alright?
[17:47.820 --> 17:48.920]  Should we move up, Gavin?
[17:50.280 --> 17:51.900]  Uh, we could, yeah.
[17:52.300 --> 17:53.520]  See if we can just drive over it.
[17:54.400 --> 17:56.380]  I bet we'll have to get out, but maybe.
[17:57.180 --> 17:58.100]  I'm just trying to see if there's...
[17:58.100 --> 18:00.000]  I just don't see anyone else on this.
[18:01.360 --> 18:02.000]  Oh shit.
[18:03.680 --> 18:04.140]  It's right here.
[18:04.360 --> 18:04.700]  It's right here.
[18:05.740 --> 18:06.260]  Alright, get in.
[18:08.480 --> 18:09.220]  Let's get out of here.
[18:10.260 --> 18:11.760]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[18:12.820 --> 18:13.140]  Yeehaw!
[18:13.460 --> 18:14.120]  Oh, not that way.
[18:15.700 --> 18:15.920]  Hello.
[18:18.220 --> 18:19.840]  I don't see any mofos.
[18:20.360 --> 18:21.780]  I think they're all on the other side.
[18:21.780 --> 18:23.040]  Alright, the chopper's gonna be a problem.
[18:23.800 --> 18:25.780]  Here, I'll work on him.
[18:27.380 --> 18:28.220]  Alright, that worked.
[18:29.080 --> 18:29.540]  That, yeah.
[18:29.840 --> 18:32.340]  I don't know if that was the idea, but hey, no bad ideas.
[18:32.720 --> 18:33.540]  No bad ideas!
[18:35.160 --> 18:36.000]  Keep moving up?
[18:36.920 --> 18:39.160]  Yeah, I guess I'll just go through the front door.
[18:39.300 --> 18:39.560]  The front door?
[18:42.440 --> 18:43.400]  What's up, dude?
[18:44.020 --> 18:44.880]  Hell yeah, get him.
[18:47.300 --> 18:47.700]  What?
[18:48.520 --> 18:48.920]  Okay.
[18:48.920 --> 18:50.160]  I'm just gonna keep this up.
[18:51.300 --> 18:52.580]  Nice, nice, Nick!
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.320]  No bad ideas!
[18:55.520 --> 18:57.120]  No bad ideas.
[18:57.900 --> 18:58.820]  Life motto, baby.
[18:58.940 --> 18:59.540]  Let's keep it up.
[19:01.260 --> 19:02.060]  Where's the target?
[19:03.880 --> 19:04.800]  This way...
[19:04.800 --> 19:05.760]  Oh god, I fell!
[19:07.860 --> 19:08.820]  Yeah, let's do it.
[19:11.900 --> 19:12.560]  There he is.
[19:13.340 --> 19:14.620]  Got him, got him, got him.
[19:15.020 --> 19:15.340]  Nice!
[19:16.180 --> 19:16.580]  Geronies!
[19:17.100 --> 19:20.460]  Come on in, there's a...
[19:22.320 --> 19:23.580]  Alright, hop in.
[19:24.340 --> 19:25.000]  It's alright, we got it.
[19:25.900 --> 19:27.300]  Oh my god, why are we in two cars?
[19:28.420 --> 19:29.200]  Team tape!
[19:30.920 --> 19:31.720]  Team tape!
[19:32.300 --> 19:34.080]  Look at the back of this van's back seats.
[19:36.020 --> 19:37.480]  Hang on, let me into your car.
[19:38.360 --> 19:40.320]  Yeah, but get in the back, because that'll be cooler.
[19:42.060 --> 19:43.700]  Yes! This rocks!
[19:43.700 --> 19:44.760]  Let's go!
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.040]  Alright, let's leave the area.
[19:48.260 --> 19:49.620]  This might dead end.
[19:51.040 --> 19:52.040]  No, back this way.
[19:53.260 --> 19:53.920]  Oh shit.
[19:54.080 --> 19:54.560]  Nice!
[19:55.300 --> 19:56.540]  Oh my god!
[19:56.980 --> 19:58.520]  Oh Gavin!
[20:00.420 --> 20:01.180]  Sorry dude.
[20:01.740 --> 20:03.640]  Alright, let's help deliver...
[20:03.640 --> 20:05.620]  Hey Gavin, I just want to point out...
[20:05.620 --> 20:06.560]  Team tape, we're already done.
[20:07.940 --> 20:10.020]  Help deliver the deposition to the planet.
[20:10.100 --> 20:11.000]  We're done, we did it.
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.220]  Team tape is done.
[20:13.660 --> 20:17.380]  I don't know why, to be honest, I don't know why it drove us to that little outlook spot when we could've just...
[20:17.380 --> 20:18.860]  We could've just walked in.
[20:19.240 --> 20:23.980]  I think they want us to take out all the guys and be like stealthy.
[20:24.180 --> 20:27.600]  But as long as you just run down and get to that guy before he runs off, you're good.
[20:28.460 --> 20:31.200]  And as long as you take a pearler off the top balcony right down to him.
[20:31.780 --> 20:35.000]  You just jump right down, you don't worry about your health or your armor.
[20:35.340 --> 20:37.260]  You just take a header down and you're good, baby.
[20:37.740 --> 20:40.080]  I just watched you disappear down there in front of me.
[20:40.080 --> 20:42.200]  Oh, I thought maybe there were stairs. There weren't.
[20:44.020 --> 20:46.100]  But hey, you know what? That's the way it is with team tape.
[20:46.480 --> 20:47.880]  That's the way it is.
[20:48.900 --> 20:51.040]  No bad ideas. Messy. Unfortunate.
[20:51.720 --> 20:52.400]  Okay, we're back.
[20:53.040 --> 20:53.360]  Sticky.
[20:55.300 --> 20:56.620]  Yeah, I don't like being sticky.
[20:56.640 --> 20:57.520]  I don't either. Not a fan.
[20:57.640 --> 20:59.060]  And Eric doesn't like it either for some reason.
[20:59.060 --> 20:59.320]  Oh, I hate it.
[21:01.420 --> 21:01.920]  Tape, huh?
[21:05.500 --> 21:08.420]  Sort of a big part of an adhesive, you might say.
[21:09.140 --> 21:10.000]  The most vital.
[21:10.300 --> 21:12.960]  So we can spectate you?
[21:13.520 --> 21:14.080]  Ooh, how?
[21:14.620 --> 21:15.260]  No bad ideas.
[21:17.400 --> 21:18.360]  Spectate crew.
[21:18.880 --> 21:20.180]  Spectate Andrew Panton.
[21:20.220 --> 21:21.200]  How are you doing that?
[21:21.440 --> 21:24.640]  No bad ideas.
[21:24.640 --> 21:25.440]  Oh, spectate crew.
[21:26.340 --> 21:28.200]  Spectate Nick. Okay, I'm watching Nick.
[21:28.800 --> 21:31.800]  Oh, they seem to be driving in the same car together.
[21:32.160 --> 21:32.300]  Okay.
[21:32.440 --> 21:34.060]  Ooh, almost hit a white car.
[21:34.460 --> 21:35.920]  Mine's loading. Mine's loading.
[21:36.860 --> 21:38.080]  Alright, here we go.
[21:38.080 --> 21:39.140]  Wow, looking good.
[21:39.720 --> 21:42.900]  Nick, how does it feel being in that car? Cool turn, good 360.
[21:43.360 --> 21:44.080]  Wanted to do a 180.
[21:44.900 --> 21:45.600]  No bad ideas.
[21:45.940 --> 21:46.440]  No bad ideas.
[21:48.040 --> 21:49.300]  No bad ideas.
[21:51.500 --> 21:52.260]  And here we go.
[21:53.480 --> 21:54.900]  Yeah, just gotta take a nice little left.
[21:55.260 --> 21:55.940]  Yeah, and you stay in the back.
[21:55.940 --> 21:57.000]  Oh my god!
[21:58.160 --> 21:59.760]  Look at how fast that turned me over.
[21:59.760 --> 22:00.600]  That was as planned.
[22:01.880 --> 22:04.680]  See, they can't...
[22:04.680 --> 22:06.800]  They can't lie about what they're doing.
[22:06.900 --> 22:09.760]  No, no, but before you started watching, we actually met about that.
[22:09.840 --> 22:10.520]  We talked about that.
[22:10.960 --> 22:12.400]  We wrote that down.
[22:13.060 --> 22:13.980]  That he was gonna do that.
[22:14.780 --> 22:15.920]  That was scheduled.
[22:20.140 --> 22:20.840]  We're almost there.
[22:21.040 --> 22:23.620]  So what did you guys do? You grabbed a plan or something?
[22:24.080 --> 22:24.860]  No, we killed two guys.
[22:24.880 --> 22:27.020]  Yeah, we assassinated a team.
[22:28.220 --> 22:29.360]  And then we stole
[22:30.620 --> 22:31.420]  their plans.
[22:31.600 --> 22:32.820]  And then we evaded the police.
[22:33.570 --> 22:35.720]  I'm kind of worried in this nice cinematic
[22:35.720 --> 22:37.640]  mode of spectating, I'm worried that I'm gonna see
[22:37.640 --> 22:38.800]  myself get run over.
[22:39.020 --> 22:41.160]  I feel the same way.
[22:41.340 --> 22:42.320]  Alright, let's get out.
[22:44.740 --> 22:45.820]  Quit spectator mode.
[22:46.160 --> 22:46.520]  Here we go.
[22:48.140 --> 22:48.600]  Hey guys.
[22:50.200 --> 22:50.640]  Hey!
[22:51.420 --> 22:52.260]  Everybody in!
[22:54.640 --> 22:55.920]  To a black screen.
[22:56.040 --> 22:56.360]  Yeah!
[22:57.620 --> 22:58.600]  We did it.
[22:59.880 --> 23:00.460]  Whoa!
[23:01.960 --> 23:03.380]  I'm looking at
[23:03.380 --> 23:05.120]  the inside of your apartment
[23:05.120 --> 23:07.320]  straight up and down. This is fucking
[23:07.320 --> 23:07.760]  crazy.
[23:08.280 --> 23:10.780]  It's all invisible see-through.
[23:11.040 --> 23:11.780]  Holy shit.
[23:12.800 --> 23:13.500]  Oh!
[23:14.930 --> 23:16.280]  Wait, no!
[23:19.300 --> 23:19.880]  Bollocks.
[23:22.020 --> 23:24.360]  This is some horse shit.
[23:26.140 --> 23:26.880]  Have you guys seen this?
[23:27.340 --> 23:28.820]  Have you looked at this yet?
[23:29.780 --> 23:31.600]  Gavin, if you could, would you help me
[23:31.600 --> 23:33.560]  throw him out that window? I would, yeah.
[23:33.880 --> 23:34.800]  Have you guys even seen this?
[23:35.180 --> 23:35.880]  I'd rip the tape.
[23:36.280 --> 23:36.440]  Yeah.
[23:41.880 --> 23:43.480]  So are we done with setup?
[23:44.260 --> 23:45.180]  Yeah, I think so.
[23:45.280 --> 23:46.220]  I think we're gonna go get him now.
[23:47.660 --> 23:48.300]  Let's do it.
[23:48.980 --> 23:50.500]  Oh, Andrew can arrange the cuts.
[23:51.780 --> 23:52.120]  Oh.
[23:52.980 --> 23:54.500]  No bad ideas, Andrew.
[23:55.720 --> 23:57.340]  I don't know, I think our tape budget
[23:57.340 --> 23:59.240]  should be increased. Yeah, I agree.
[23:59.580 --> 24:02.260]  Let's reduce this, first of all.
[24:03.040 --> 24:04.220]  Very generous of you.
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.820]  You spent the money on it though,
[24:05.860 --> 24:06.800]  so make sure you make your cut.
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.480]  He's got Andrew at 40, Nick at 25%,
[24:10.480 --> 24:11.520]  me at 20%,
[24:11.520 --> 24:13.300]  and Eric at 15%.
[24:13.300 --> 24:14.400]  Why do I get 15?
[24:16.580 --> 24:18.280]  Why is Nick getting 25?
[24:18.820 --> 24:19.560]  Who's getting what?
[24:20.140 --> 24:20.920]  No bad ideas.
[24:21.800 --> 24:23.720]  Who gives a fuck about no bad ideas?
[24:23.840 --> 24:25.020]  I'm not readying up for this.
[24:25.020 --> 24:25.940]  I'm out.
[24:27.580 --> 24:28.460]  No thanks.
[24:29.300 --> 24:30.820]  Four minutes, 30 seconds.
[24:32.800 --> 24:34.280]  I'll get a glass of water.
[24:34.500 --> 24:36.380]  You think I won't make you wait four minutes
[24:36.380 --> 24:37.820]  instead of giving me more percentage?
[24:39.700 --> 24:40.920]  What percentage do you want?
[24:41.020 --> 24:41.300]  25.
[24:41.520 --> 24:42.620]  No, what percentage do you want?
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.520]  I'm willing to give five more percent
[24:44.520 --> 24:46.640]  if you two can figure out who gets it between you two.
[24:48.200 --> 24:49.480]  We're not caged animals.
[24:49.980 --> 24:51.520]  I want 25 for both of us.
[24:51.700 --> 24:52.700]  That's my final offer.
[24:55.140 --> 24:56.160]  Good for you.
[24:56.460 --> 24:56.860]  Congrats.
[24:57.700 --> 24:59.140]  You're getting none of it.
[25:01.500 --> 25:03.180]  I'm gonna call Geoff right now
[25:03.180 --> 25:05.300]  and swap you out. I can get another crew in here.
[25:05.680 --> 25:07.540]  Go ahead, call Geoff right now.
[25:07.680 --> 25:08.420]  Yeah, swap him out.
[25:10.420 --> 25:13.140]  You know what, Andrew?
[25:13.240 --> 25:15.260]  You take the 40 and I'll be 20 with them.
[25:17.260 --> 25:20.300]  No, I don't want to be 20 with you.
[25:20.460 --> 25:22.460]  I don't want to be 20 with you.
[25:22.460 --> 25:23.740]  I want 25.
[25:24.340 --> 25:25.980]  He paid for this.
[25:26.700 --> 25:27.640]  Yeah, he's true.
[25:27.900 --> 25:30.860]  He bankrolled this.
[25:32.100 --> 25:33.620]  So he has to make his cut.
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.560]  It means nothing to me.
[25:37.020 --> 25:39.480]  Right, because you're a bad teammate.
[25:40.420 --> 25:42.660]  $25,000 was the setup cost.
[25:44.700 --> 25:44.900]  Right.
[25:45.400 --> 25:46.980]  Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.
[25:47.240 --> 25:49.300]  I thought you put Geoff on the line.
[25:49.360 --> 25:51.760]  You got no one, son.
[25:53.820 --> 25:54.220]  Okay.
[25:55.140 --> 25:55.820]  Well, listen.
[25:55.980 --> 25:58.820]  I put money in, so I need to have a little bit higher cut.
[26:00.040 --> 26:00.260]  Okay.
[26:00.560 --> 26:01.420]  That's just fair.
[26:01.720 --> 26:04.460]  Okay, so here's what I propose.
[26:04.500 --> 26:05.280]  That's just fair.
[26:05.380 --> 26:08.160]  Are you all happy with this?
[26:09.440 --> 26:11.000]  I want Gavin to have 25.
[26:14.760 --> 26:16.060]  I gotta get more.
[26:16.200 --> 26:18.120]  I gotta get a little more because I put money in.
[26:18.240 --> 26:20.320]  Okay, so take it off of Nick and put it on Gavin
[26:20.320 --> 26:21.120]  and then let's go.
[26:23.640 --> 26:24.880]  Geoff just texted me.
[26:24.980 --> 26:26.160]  I'm in the car with my in-laws.
[26:29.600 --> 26:30.680]  Tell him it's important.
[26:31.720 --> 26:33.100]  This is life or death.
[26:35.700 --> 26:36.420]  Alright, fine.
[26:38.440 --> 26:41.440]  Nick, do you have any idea what we're about to do?
[26:42.400 --> 26:43.500]  I'm about to fly a plane.
[26:46.060 --> 26:48.520]  But you guys are about to get on the bus.
[26:48.820 --> 26:49.800]  Stop another bus.
[26:51.560 --> 26:52.280]  And then...
[26:52.940 --> 26:54.360]  Get in the prison bus.
[26:54.420 --> 26:57.420]  I'm gonna go intercept the prison bus.
[26:57.980 --> 26:59.280]  Okay. Andrew, hop in.
[27:00.280 --> 27:00.760]  Getting in.
[27:05.120 --> 27:06.440]  I'm going to the airport, fellas.
[27:09.240 --> 27:10.560]  Oh my god, it's all the way over there.
[27:17.020 --> 27:19.380]  Oh god, I suddenly have to pee really bad.
[27:21.200 --> 27:22.580]  That just makes you fly better.
[27:22.760 --> 27:23.980]  Oh, I don't think that's true.
[27:24.400 --> 27:26.180]  Yeah, that's what they're always saying.
[27:30.460 --> 27:31.920]  You got a bottle at your desk?
[27:34.600 --> 27:36.220]  No. No bad ideas!
[27:37.740 --> 27:40.040]  I do have one over there.
[27:41.440 --> 27:44.360]  I have a bud-like clamato in the fridge.
[27:46.060 --> 27:48.940]  You'd have to chug it before you could piss in it.
[27:48.940 --> 27:50.160]  Yeah, I'll be right back.
[27:51.160 --> 27:53.420]  There's nothing more gross
[27:53.420 --> 27:55.300]  than a man chugging a bud-like
[27:55.300 --> 27:56.820]  clamato to pee in.
[27:56.920 --> 27:57.780]  Fucking vile.
[27:58.460 --> 27:59.600]  Oh, to pee. I'm sorry.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.320]  I thought you meant, like, take a drink.
[28:02.740 --> 28:03.360]  When you said bottle.
[28:03.880 --> 28:07.920]  Right, I have to pee.
[28:08.140 --> 28:10.940]  Dude, I have to piss. I gotta chug this bud-like
[28:10.940 --> 28:12.040]  clamato now.
[28:14.060 --> 28:15.940]  I thought it was common nerves.
[28:19.080 --> 28:20.580]  Do you have a bottle?
[28:20.800 --> 28:23.360]  Oh, I guess I could use a refreshment right now.
[28:23.500 --> 28:24.900]  What are you talking about?
[28:24.920 --> 28:26.300]  I don't know how this is a functional business.
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.260]  There are so many such easy
[28:29.980 --> 28:30.420]  misunderstandings.
[28:30.560 --> 28:32.000]  I don't know how anything works.
[28:32.420 --> 28:34.480]  Are you talking about the game or our business?
[28:35.140 --> 28:35.580]  Both!
[28:35.940 --> 28:37.600]  We had the whole, like,
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.140]  seasonal upload thing
[28:40.140 --> 28:41.840]  conversation this morning that Nick was
[28:41.840 --> 28:42.800]  his last juror.
[28:44.120 --> 28:45.440]  At least we got a life now.
[28:45.980 --> 28:48.300]  Alright, I've reached the
[28:48.300 --> 28:48.880]  plane.
[28:53.800 --> 28:54.940]  Alright, I'm hoppin'
[28:55.020 --> 28:55.820]  in the plane.
[28:59.480 --> 29:00.240]  What am I doing?
[29:00.440 --> 29:00.640]  Oh!
[29:02.860 --> 29:04.400]  Okay, that wasn't great.
[29:04.960 --> 29:06.020]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[29:06.440 --> 29:07.220]  That was pretty cool.
[29:10.500 --> 29:10.900]  Okay.
[29:11.600 --> 29:13.180]  Eric, are you helping get the prison bus?
[29:13.440 --> 29:15.680]  I'm getting the prison bus right now. I just took out the
[29:15.680 --> 29:17.040]  corrections officer. I should be
[29:17.640 --> 29:19.680]  free and clear here in just a second. We'll see
[29:19.680 --> 29:21.240]  if I get popped for anything for cops.
[29:21.700 --> 29:23.040]  But it looks like I'm good.
[29:24.620 --> 29:25.740]  Okay, I'm
[29:25.740 --> 29:27.820]  heading to Sandy Shore's airfield now.
[29:28.960 --> 29:29.420]  Okay.
[29:29.680 --> 29:30.600]  Gettin' in the prison bus.
[29:31.120 --> 29:33.120]  Alright, wheels are up, baby!
[29:35.080 --> 29:35.600]  Uh-oh.
[29:36.560 --> 29:37.820]  This is it.
[29:38.100 --> 29:39.320]  The apocalypse.
[29:40.600 --> 29:40.880]  Woah.
[29:41.500 --> 29:43.720]  Now make sure to turn all the gain up so you distort
[29:43.720 --> 29:44.600]  in every single word.
[29:45.880 --> 29:47.200]  In my mind!
[29:48.120 --> 29:48.560]  Hahaha.
[29:51.880 --> 29:52.640]  Nick's singing,
[29:52.880 --> 29:55.260]  Welcome to the new age while peeing in a Clamato
[29:55.260 --> 29:57.280]  bottle. No, he's chugging it, he's not peeing.
[29:57.320 --> 29:59.620]  He's chugging it. He's singing and he's chugging.
[30:00.120 --> 30:01.280]  He's calming his nerves
[30:01.280 --> 30:02.820]  by overfilling his bladder.
[30:03.860 --> 30:05.040]  I'm so nervous!
[30:05.180 --> 30:06.480]  I gotta drink until I piss!
[30:07.000 --> 30:07.360]  Aargh!
[30:09.020 --> 30:11.300]  This is a team. This is... Can you guys believe
[30:11.300 --> 30:13.040]  we started a business? We started a business
[30:13.040 --> 30:15.100]  and we're at work. Oh, it's great.
[30:15.920 --> 30:16.800]  This rocks.
[30:18.420 --> 30:18.660]  We are
[30:18.660 --> 30:20.760]  so appreciative of you. Absolutely!
[30:20.960 --> 30:22.740]  Thank you for people who actually watch this.
[30:23.180 --> 30:25.160]  Yeah, yeah! Cause I love, I certainly love
[30:25.160 --> 30:27.200]  doing it. Although I'm in more meetings
[30:27.200 --> 30:28.720]  now than I used to be. Yeah.
[30:28.860 --> 30:30.720]  Yeah, one. You're in one.
[30:31.460 --> 30:32.720]  That's more than I used to have.
[30:32.820 --> 30:33.480]  It's true.
[30:35.200 --> 30:36.900]  Are we gonna park inside the prison? I'd say
[30:36.900 --> 30:38.900]  mine have reduced by...
[30:38.900 --> 30:40.920]  Oh, 90%? Oh, I mean
[30:40.920 --> 30:42.800]  90 might be...
[30:42.800 --> 30:44.680]  Like a low-ball number. Yeah.
[30:46.380 --> 30:48.640]  My wife said that the other day. She was just like
[30:48.640 --> 30:50.820]  the amount of time that you
[30:50.820 --> 30:52.900]  are making stuff now has gone up
[30:52.900 --> 30:53.900]  like crazy.
[30:54.680 --> 30:56.440]  It's really how it feels.
[30:57.400 --> 30:58.800]  Let's not give away anything,
[30:58.960 --> 31:00.940]  Gavin. Let's not give away anything
[31:00.940 --> 31:03.140]  as I push you with my bright pink gun.
[31:04.120 --> 31:04.280]  Yeah.
[31:05.120 --> 31:06.700]  Just some standard
[31:06.700 --> 31:07.900]  prisoner inmate.
[31:09.040 --> 31:10.940]  That was the same thing. Prisoner
[31:10.940 --> 31:12.860]  guard prisoner inmate.
[31:15.680 --> 31:16.200]  Oh!
[31:20.260 --> 31:20.780]  Evasive
[31:20.780 --> 31:21.680]  maneuvers!
[31:23.880 --> 31:24.880]  I'm glad I'm not
[31:24.880 --> 31:26.900]  the pilot. It sounds like
[31:26.900 --> 31:28.820]  it sucks. I remember being the pilot.
[31:29.080 --> 31:29.820]  Stop! Stop!
[31:31.300 --> 31:31.980]  Where's the jets?
[31:32.320 --> 31:33.720]  What are we supposed to do here?
[31:35.200 --> 31:36.600]  What?! Cause he said
[31:36.600 --> 31:39.000]  stop or I'll shoot! What were we doing wrong?
[31:39.700 --> 31:40.820]  I don't know!
[31:41.200 --> 31:42.300]  Oh god, it's kicking off!
[31:43.380 --> 31:44.700]  It's kicking off so bad!
[31:45.900 --> 31:47.140]  I'm making my way through the prison
[31:47.140 --> 31:48.960]  I guess. I don't know what I'm doing. Where'd you go?
[31:49.760 --> 31:51.020]  I went up the ladder. Okay, I'm
[31:51.020 --> 31:53.220]  coming up the ladder. How the hell do I
[31:53.220 --> 31:53.980]  evade jets?
[31:55.140 --> 31:56.940]  You can do it. Oh
[31:56.940 --> 31:58.600]  fuck. Does anyone have rockets?
[32:00.440 --> 32:00.780]  No.
[32:01.020 --> 32:03.540]  Yeah, I got a rocket. Well...
[32:03.920 --> 32:04.920]  I don't know if that's helpful.
[32:05.280 --> 32:06.020]  Where are you, Andrew?
[32:06.020 --> 32:09.000]  Uh oh. Uh...
[32:09.000 --> 32:09.920]  I'm running back.
[32:10.100 --> 32:11.120]  I'm on the blue thing.
[32:12.040 --> 32:13.640]  Oh, I gotta return to the prison yard!
[32:13.900 --> 32:14.160]  Fuck!
[32:16.780 --> 32:17.300]  Okay.
[32:19.120 --> 32:20.120]  Oh, I'm getting lit up.
[32:20.260 --> 32:21.560]  I'm getting lit up over here.
[32:22.100 --> 32:23.080]  Where? Where from?
[32:24.400 --> 32:25.900]  Uh, just everywhere. Look at
[32:25.900 --> 32:27.020]  all the dots!
[32:30.560 --> 32:31.820]  Noose is on the way.
[32:32.320 --> 32:33.360]  Not the noose!
[32:36.040 --> 32:38.120]  I don't think my laser gun is very good.
[32:40.180 --> 32:41.420]  But it's so cool!
[32:42.180 --> 32:42.980]  Sounds cool.
[32:44.260 --> 32:45.100]  Looks cool too.
[32:46.240 --> 32:47.980]  The jet and I seem to be dancing.
[32:48.520 --> 32:50.180]  You got it, Nick. You just keep doing your thing, Nick.
[32:50.220 --> 32:51.280]  You got it. Collecting our man.
[32:53.040 --> 32:54.120]  I'm stealing the
[32:54.120 --> 32:56.060]  buzzard and I hope that it's
[32:56.060 --> 32:57.900]  to steal the buzzard and help you. I have no idea.
[32:57.900 --> 32:58.660]  I think it is.
[32:59.740 --> 33:01.460]  I'm almost there. I'm so close.
[33:01.940 --> 33:02.560]  Just sit tight.
[33:03.900 --> 33:04.380]  Geronimo!
[33:07.080 --> 33:08.300]  He's just hanging out.
[33:09.560 --> 33:10.100]  Eating a meat pie?
[33:10.500 --> 33:11.240]  Grab the gun, son!
[33:12.180 --> 33:13.160]  No bad idea!
[33:14.140 --> 33:15.980]  Hell yeah, Andrew. Say it.
[33:16.900 --> 33:18.020]  I just did!
[33:18.300 --> 33:20.660]  Say it again! No bad ideas!
[33:25.720 --> 33:26.620]  Buzzard acquired!
[33:28.320 --> 33:30.380]  Are you gonna pick us up from the prison?
[33:31.780 --> 33:32.740]  It says
[33:32.740 --> 33:34.060]  protect the vellum.
[33:34.140 --> 33:36.340]  What's the vellum? That's the thing I'm in.
[33:38.240 --> 33:40.260]  Eric, I'm on the tail of the jet!
[33:40.720 --> 33:41.720]  How do I fire guns?
[33:42.860 --> 33:44.020]  You gotta switch to the rockets.
[33:47.040 --> 33:48.420]  How is this jet going
[33:48.420 --> 33:50.060]  slower than this prop plane?
[33:52.940 --> 33:54.240]  Randy Quaid is just
[33:54.240 --> 33:56.440]  riding by you. Are you in front of it
[33:56.440 --> 33:57.900]  or behind it? Behind it!
[33:57.900 --> 34:00.080]  He can't get me if I'm behind him.
[34:00.380 --> 34:00.980]  I'm almost there.
[34:01.700 --> 34:03.860]  Oh, fuck me. Unless he tricks me.
[34:07.380 --> 34:10.200]  Alright, F this. I'm going back to the...
[34:11.000 --> 34:11.700]  I'm coming.
[34:12.120 --> 34:13.160]  I'm right here with you.
[34:14.020 --> 34:15.260]  So you just turn... Okay, I see.
[34:16.260 --> 34:17.680]  I'm dropping down low
[34:17.680 --> 34:18.840]  so he can't shoot me.
[34:20.120 --> 34:21.260]  I'm out of bullets, Gavin.
[34:22.840 --> 34:23.720]  Gavin died?!
[34:23.720 --> 34:25.540]  It's okay, he just has to respawn.
[34:27.900 --> 34:28.560]  Yeah, you start life.
[34:30.080 --> 34:32.140]  Alright, Eric, did you change from bullets to rockets?
[34:32.580 --> 34:33.600]  How do you do that?
[34:33.840 --> 34:34.180]  X.
[34:35.100 --> 34:37.180]  Here we go.
[34:37.260 --> 34:40.500]  What was that?
[34:41.200 --> 34:41.740]  He's got luck!
[34:43.140 --> 34:43.840]  Dodge it!
[34:45.080 --> 34:46.040]  Dick and duck!
[34:48.260 --> 34:49.540]  Dick, duck, and dive!
[34:51.260 --> 34:51.780]  Dick!
[34:52.480 --> 34:53.620]  Can you lock on?
[34:54.980 --> 34:56.080]  One of those rockets
[34:56.080 --> 34:56.620]  is homing.
[34:57.100 --> 34:58.040]  Here we go.
[34:59.820 --> 35:00.360]  Rockets away!
[35:01.560 --> 35:02.820]  There's more of them!
[35:03.140 --> 35:03.880]  Rockets away!
[35:07.220 --> 35:08.540]  Where is he?
[35:10.320 --> 35:11.320]  Nick, I'm coming.
[35:14.060 --> 35:15.740]  Nick, keep evading. You're doing great.
[35:16.500 --> 35:17.100]  I'm over the prison!
[35:18.400 --> 35:19.380]  Rockets away!
[35:20.520 --> 35:21.340]  Rockets away!
[35:25.170 --> 35:25.730]  Got him!
[35:26.090 --> 35:27.330]  Hit him!
[35:28.850 --> 35:29.890]  There we go!
[35:30.050 --> 35:30.530]  We got him!
[35:31.910 --> 35:33.230]  Now where are we going, Nick?
[35:34.390 --> 35:35.250]  There's another one!
[35:35.510 --> 35:35.910]  No!
[35:39.790 --> 35:40.510]  He's west.
[35:41.190 --> 35:42.430]  We gotta clear the area, Gavin.
[35:42.670 --> 35:43.810]  Why would we get in that?
[35:44.910 --> 35:46.250]  You keep doing what you're doing, Nick.
[35:46.310 --> 35:46.750]  You're doing great.
[35:47.290 --> 35:47.650]  Alright!
[35:51.640 --> 35:52.700]  What the fuck?
[35:53.320 --> 35:54.920]  Wish I realized what they were talking about with that bottle.
[35:57.740 --> 35:58.920]  Don't drink a Clamato!
[36:00.940 --> 36:01.820]  I see him.
[36:04.680 --> 36:05.920]  He's coming. He's coming the other way.
[36:06.180 --> 36:06.760]  Coming the other way.
[36:08.080 --> 36:08.800]  Oh, Nick.
[36:11.140 --> 36:11.660]  There's Eric.
[36:11.740 --> 36:12.340]  Trying to cut around.
[36:13.600 --> 36:14.320]  Come on!
[36:16.620 --> 36:17.680]  Rockets away!
[36:18.100 --> 36:19.880]  Starting to push.
[36:20.440 --> 36:21.720]  Homing rockets out.
[36:22.260 --> 36:23.040]  Two rockets out.
[36:24.340 --> 36:25.640]  Nice shot, Eric!
[36:27.240 --> 36:28.640]  One more!
[36:28.840 --> 36:29.040]  One more!
[36:30.580 --> 36:31.000]  Another!
[36:31.600 --> 36:32.820]  Third wave!
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.080]  How many bloody jets are there?
[36:36.300 --> 36:37.780]  I think it's until they get done.
[36:43.150 --> 36:44.270]  Pulling back on the yoke.
[36:44.790 --> 36:46.430]  Come back around. The way you're going is good.
[36:46.750 --> 36:47.490]  Pushing up.
[36:48.250 --> 36:50.150]  Trying to spot him. I don't see him.
[36:51.290 --> 36:52.250]  He's away. He's away.
[36:52.410 --> 36:53.310]  Yeah, yeah. He's...
[36:53.310 --> 36:54.210]  There he is.
[36:56.250 --> 36:57.730]  We gotta be near the end.
[36:58.350 --> 36:58.850]  We gotta be.
[36:59.030 --> 36:59.850]  Rockets away.
[37:01.410 --> 37:03.070]  Go and collect them. Oh, we gotta go get him.
[37:04.170 --> 37:05.010]  Alright, I got him.
[37:05.150 --> 37:06.550]  Did I get him?
[37:07.790 --> 37:09.410]  Nick, tell me that was good.
[37:09.630 --> 37:10.430]  That was gorgeous.
[37:10.430 --> 37:11.810]  I'm gonna get out of here with him.
[37:12.230 --> 37:13.310]  Fuck, that was awesome!
[37:15.270 --> 37:16.770]  Do we get in the prison bus now?
[37:16.990 --> 37:18.170]  Yeah, go get a bus to pick us up.
[37:18.750 --> 37:19.110]  Yeah.
[37:19.370 --> 37:20.530]  Oh, he fell!
[37:22.410 --> 37:23.510]  You keep him up!
[37:26.470 --> 37:28.550]  I turned around to head back towards the bus
[37:28.550 --> 37:29.410]  so I just knocked him.
[37:30.370 --> 37:32.750]  Yeah, yeah. There you go. Keep circling the airfield like that.
[37:32.790 --> 37:33.290]  It's doing great.
[37:33.890 --> 37:34.790]  I'm full of holes.
[37:36.630 --> 37:38.010]  The bus is still locked.
[37:38.010 --> 37:38.530]  Shit.
[37:39.830 --> 37:40.770]  Can't use the bus.
[37:41.130 --> 37:43.550]  What if we left the keys for the heist?
[37:44.030 --> 37:45.150]  How do we get out?
[37:46.750 --> 37:48.370]  Nick, keep circling. He's coming for you.
[37:49.190 --> 37:49.990]  I know!
[37:50.650 --> 37:52.510]  Keep doing your thing. I gotta pay attention, bud.
[37:53.690 --> 37:54.430]  Do you have any idea
[37:54.430 --> 37:55.150]  how to get out of here?
[37:55.650 --> 37:57.870]  Let's keep working the way around that we were heading towards.
[37:59.050 --> 37:59.270]  Okay.
[38:03.020 --> 38:03.960]  Can't see anything
[38:03.960 --> 38:04.680]  on that side.
[38:05.420 --> 38:06.220]  Rockets away.
[38:06.720 --> 38:07.580]  Rockets away.
[38:08.640 --> 38:10.080]  Nothing over here.
[38:10.940 --> 38:12.680]  Rockets away. That should be it.
[38:13.500 --> 38:13.840]  Come on.
[38:14.520 --> 38:15.000]  Is this it?
[38:15.600 --> 38:17.240]  This looks promising.
[38:18.080 --> 38:18.800]  Nick, circle.
[38:19.940 --> 38:21.220]  I'm in an armored car.
[38:21.420 --> 38:21.980]  Almost got him.
[38:23.560 --> 38:24.840]  Get in here.
[38:25.080 --> 38:25.580]  Nick, look out.
[38:30.890 --> 38:32.610]  No! Why would you get in the front?
[38:33.070 --> 38:33.550]  Whatever.
[38:35.950 --> 38:37.090]  Rockets, he's right behind you.
[38:37.090 --> 38:38.530]  Rockets away. Come on, get him.
[38:38.790 --> 38:39.590]  Come on.
[38:40.590 --> 38:41.790]  There we go.
[38:42.110 --> 38:42.590]  We're getting out.
[38:44.110 --> 38:45.850]  There we go. Got it.
[38:46.010 --> 38:48.090]  We gotta get in the vellum.
[38:50.410 --> 38:50.930]  Help.
[38:51.750 --> 38:51.850]  Get.
[38:52.190 --> 38:52.410]  Okay.
[38:56.440 --> 38:58.120]  We gotta sync up a landing zone.
[38:59.720 --> 39:00.820]  We're near a runway.
[39:02.880 --> 39:04.120]  Nick, that's you, right?
[39:04.580 --> 39:04.840]  Yeah.
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.460]  I'm gonna land at the airport.
[39:09.820 --> 39:10.380]  Keep supporting.
[39:11.340 --> 39:12.720]  I'm gonna land right over here.
[39:12.840 --> 39:14.540]  I see you.
[39:15.460 --> 39:16.560]  We're coming for you.
[39:17.380 --> 39:18.180]  Coming in.
[39:18.360 --> 39:20.940]  I'll try to take these helicopters out.
[39:22.220 --> 39:22.240]  Okay.
[39:23.140 --> 39:23.620]  Slowly.
[39:24.660 --> 39:25.760]  We got some air.
[39:26.040 --> 39:26.660]  That was nice.
[39:27.060 --> 39:27.960]  That looked great.
[39:30.640 --> 39:32.200]  We're coming right behind you.
[39:32.520 --> 39:33.260]  Please hurry.
[39:33.260 --> 39:34.540]  Come on.
[39:34.600 --> 39:35.280]  Full speed.
[39:36.080 --> 39:38.920]  Okay, slow down.
[39:39.580 --> 39:40.360]  I'm taking shots.
[39:41.840 --> 39:42.220]  You're fine.
[39:42.340 --> 39:43.780]  I got this helicopter coming down.
[39:44.220 --> 39:45.060]  Got him.
[39:46.980 --> 39:47.340]  Helicopters.
[39:47.980 --> 39:50.760]  Get in.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.300]  You got this.
[39:53.000 --> 39:53.360]  Reverse.
[39:53.720 --> 39:55.900]  Take off.
[39:57.520 --> 39:58.900]  It's not gonna work.
[39:59.520 --> 40:00.320]  Mow him down.
[40:03.000 --> 40:03.560]  Go.
[40:05.000 --> 40:05.180]  Go.
[40:05.420 --> 40:05.900]  Go.
[40:08.780 --> 40:09.340]  Yeah.
[40:11.140 --> 40:12.120]  Eric, shoot him.
[40:12.200 --> 40:12.540]  Kill him.
[40:12.580 --> 40:13.360]  I'm trying.
[40:15.540 --> 40:17.540]  This is the slowest piece.
[40:17.760 --> 40:19.260]  We're gonna lose the cops.
[40:19.480 --> 40:19.900]  I'm trying.
[40:26.640 --> 40:27.780]  Amongst all the chaos,
[40:27.780 --> 40:28.780]  I just heard him go,
[40:29.340 --> 40:30.020]  Help me.
[40:32.300 --> 40:34.100]  Take us out to sea,
[40:34.380 --> 40:34.620]  Nick.
[40:36.400 --> 40:37.940]  To sea we go.
[40:42.100 --> 40:42.580]  Nice.
[40:44.760 --> 40:45.600]  Okay, we're losing them.
[40:46.300 --> 40:46.640]  We're good.
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.580]  We had five stars.
[40:51.860 --> 40:54.000]  You broke a guy out of prison
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.120]  and killed all the cops.
[40:55.120 --> 40:55.720]  Pretty bad.
[40:56.160 --> 40:58.200]  I think that's a felony.
[40:58.580 --> 40:59.440]  Should we go through the windmills?
[41:00.280 --> 41:00.580]  Yes.
[41:19.580 --> 41:20.220]  Nick!
[41:21.400 --> 41:22.780]  One insane move.
[41:23.420 --> 41:25.800]  One absolutely insane move.
[41:25.920 --> 41:27.520]  So I don't have anything
[41:27.520 --> 41:28.540]  to say about that.
[41:28.940 --> 41:32.200]  Let's do it again.
[41:33.460 --> 41:34.580]  Let's do it again.
[41:34.580 --> 41:36.680]  Team Tape would never. That's all I'm saying.
[41:36.680 --> 41:37.080]  That's it.
[41:37.760 --> 41:40.100]  Team Tape encouraged that shit.
[41:40.380 --> 41:41.400]  I want to be clear.
[41:42.360 --> 41:42.900]  Team Tape.
[41:43.300 --> 41:43.620]  No.
[41:43.820 --> 41:47.040]  Of course.
[41:48.360 --> 41:49.100]  What did you think?
[41:51.500 --> 41:52.060]  Nick.
[41:52.420 --> 41:53.280]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[41:53.380 --> 41:55.640]  I feel very bad now.
[41:56.640 --> 41:57.200]  Nick.
[41:59.140 --> 41:59.540]  Annoying.
[42:02.860 --> 42:03.820]  Let's just do it
[42:03.820 --> 42:04.720]  all over again.
[42:05.220 --> 42:07.360]  Well, maybe we can do it stealth this time.
[42:08.460 --> 42:09.160]  Oh yeah, you guys
[42:09.160 --> 42:10.840]  kind of know what you're supposed to do, right?
[42:11.420 --> 42:13.280]  Well, he said stop moving.
[42:13.820 --> 42:14.760]  It's on you, Gavin.
[42:14.880 --> 42:16.420]  You got to do something about that guy, I think.
[42:17.500 --> 42:18.900]  Should I just pistol-silent him?
[42:19.500 --> 42:20.820]  Yeah, if you can.
[42:23.040 --> 42:25.140]  Oh my god, we were flying away.
[42:25.140 --> 42:25.640]  Yeah.
[42:27.020 --> 42:28.200]  We were flying away?
[42:28.320 --> 42:30.860]  Yeah, we were done. I had taken out
[42:30.860 --> 42:32.540]  I don't know how many dozen
[42:33.840 --> 42:34.940]  helicopters and planes.
[42:34.980 --> 42:35.220]  Yeah, I know.
[42:35.800 --> 42:38.200]  That was basically a retry.
[42:38.940 --> 42:39.300]  Yes.
[42:40.380 --> 42:43.160]  Getting right to the end and going, wouldn't it be funny if we just did it one more time?
[42:43.620 --> 42:43.980]  No.
[42:44.400 --> 42:46.760]  No, I don't think it would be funny, no.
[42:47.660 --> 42:49.360]  Yeah, I heard go through the fans
[42:49.360 --> 42:51.220]  and I thought, he's certainly not going to do that
[42:51.220 --> 42:52.520]  so I don't need to go for him.
[42:52.520 --> 42:52.980]  He's not.
[42:53.160 --> 42:55.520]  I think we need to get a little bit close to him.
[42:57.720 --> 42:58.800]  Oh my god.
[42:58.880 --> 42:59.580]  Okay, okay.
[43:00.660 --> 43:01.460]  Lock it in.
[43:03.180 --> 43:04.300]  Lock it in.
[43:04.360 --> 43:05.500]  Park inside the prison.
[43:05.900 --> 43:07.720]  I think Nick just really enjoyed being the pilot.
[43:11.340 --> 43:11.780]  Yeah.
[43:12.100 --> 43:13.400]  Yeah, so he's going to do it again.
[43:14.380 --> 43:15.140]  No bad ideas.
[43:16.660 --> 43:17.620]  Don't encourage me.
[43:19.500 --> 43:20.380]  There are...
[43:20.380 --> 43:21.360]  I mean, you certainly aren't
[43:21.360 --> 43:22.780]  capable of doing that again.
[43:23.080 --> 43:25.340]  That's what Team Tape does though, they encourage.
[43:26.380 --> 43:27.680]  Oh, what changed?
[43:30.080 --> 43:31.500]  Is it because I have a
[43:31.500 --> 43:32.700]  custom silenced pistol?
[43:33.220 --> 43:34.820]  Oh, I think so. I think that may have been it.
[43:35.980 --> 43:37.160]  That's fine. That's okay.
[43:37.320 --> 43:37.920]  We're fine.
[43:42.970 --> 43:44.290]  Not a very good pistol.
[43:45.110 --> 43:46.830]  Oh, this is like a speed run now.
[43:46.930 --> 43:48.730]  Yeah, I'm flying through this thing.
[43:49.670 --> 43:50.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:50.550 --> 43:52.650]  You know what? I just wanted us to do this professionally.
[43:55.050 --> 43:56.870]  I'm about to call Geoff and replace Nick
[43:56.870 --> 43:57.570]  in this whole heist.
[43:58.110 --> 44:00.330]  You sure could. He can't. He's in the Zindelands.
[44:00.810 --> 44:02.030]  He's with him. He's not in him.
[44:04.790 --> 44:06.630]  I don't know what's going on over there.
[44:07.150 --> 44:08.590]  Boy, I don't normally feel this way,
[44:08.690 --> 44:10.210]  but boy, am I sheepish right now.
[44:11.750 --> 44:12.970]  I just can't believe
[44:12.970 --> 44:14.230]  that was so unlike you.
[44:14.290 --> 44:15.830]  I can't believe you did that.
[44:15.830 --> 44:17.190]  I don't know what happened.
[44:17.270 --> 44:19.850]  It's like Achievement Hunter came alive in my blood.
[44:21.110 --> 44:22.230]  I appreciate it.
[44:22.610 --> 44:23.990]  I thought it was a move
[44:23.990 --> 44:25.190]  that would come into my head
[44:25.190 --> 44:26.370]  that I wouldn't be allowed to do,
[44:26.610 --> 44:28.450]  but you did it.
[44:29.650 --> 44:31.970]  I was prepared to yell at Gavin,
[44:32.370 --> 44:33.370]  and then it was like,
[44:33.430 --> 44:34.330]  oh no, Nick's the pilot.
[44:34.570 --> 44:39.150]  Yeah, I looked up.
[44:39.330 --> 44:40.870]  I glanced down for a second.
[44:42.910 --> 44:43.830]  I saw a challenge.
[44:43.830 --> 44:46.050]  I was watching it, and all of a sudden
[44:46.050 --> 44:47.950]  it was just three names
[44:47.950 --> 44:49.870]  got flattened, and it was like,
[44:49.950 --> 44:50.130]  oops.
[44:52.190 --> 44:53.270]  I'm evading jets.
[44:53.710 --> 44:54.610]  You're doing great, Nick.
[44:54.750 --> 44:57.050]  I'm stealing the buzzard right now, and I'm on my way.
[44:57.550 --> 44:59.670]  That's alright. Take your time. I'm just going to sit in a holding pattern
[44:59.670 --> 45:00.670]  for the rest of the game.
[45:03.910 --> 45:04.950]  Gavin, what happened?
[45:06.090 --> 45:07.190]  That's just what I do there.
[45:08.550 --> 45:09.310]  Oh, okay.
[45:09.730 --> 45:10.290]  That's good.
[45:11.690 --> 45:13.210]  There he is.
[45:19.370 --> 45:20.230]  And we're off.
[45:21.350 --> 45:22.550]  Heading for the airfield.
[45:22.970 --> 45:23.730]  Alright, I'm on my way.
[45:23.910 --> 45:25.650]  Really like it if that door would close.
[45:27.690 --> 45:28.050]  Okay.
[45:28.230 --> 45:29.250]  Looks like we're good on the jets.
[45:30.090 --> 45:30.470]  Oh, good.
[45:32.450 --> 45:33.270]  Headed for the field.
[45:33.650 --> 45:35.370]  Go to the airfield, just like last time.
[45:35.490 --> 45:36.850]  I'll just keep an eye out for helicopters.
[45:37.630 --> 45:38.950]  How close are you guys, would you say?
[45:40.590 --> 45:41.770]  We're there, essentially.
[45:41.770 --> 45:42.850]  Alright, sweet, I'm landing.
[45:44.890 --> 45:45.790]  They are not there,
[45:45.850 --> 45:47.090]  essentially, but they will be there quickly.
[45:48.190 --> 45:49.890]  Yeah, well, essentially is
[45:49.890 --> 45:50.650]  the key word.
[45:52.310 --> 45:53.910]  I would have said
[45:53.910 --> 45:54.690]  45 seconds.
[45:55.570 --> 45:56.210]  Oh, dear.
[45:57.290 --> 45:58.010]  Yeah, it's going to be a while.
[46:01.390 --> 46:02.870]  We are coordinating, dickhead.
[46:03.670 --> 46:04.610]  We're working on it.
[46:04.910 --> 46:07.310]  We're debating about if 45 seconds is essentially.
[46:07.670 --> 46:07.930]  Right.
[46:09.270 --> 46:10.250]  Nice shooting, Eric.
[46:10.470 --> 46:11.430]  Thank you.
[46:12.550 --> 46:12.950]  Nice.
[46:14.210 --> 46:16.070]  I'm just trying to get them before they get close.
[46:16.210 --> 46:17.190]  I'm getting there, I'm getting there.
[46:17.950 --> 46:20.150]  You know what, doing this a second time,
[46:20.750 --> 46:21.530]  real easy.
[46:22.310 --> 46:23.130]  Not bad, is it?
[46:23.810 --> 46:25.550]  No, that was not
[46:26.170 --> 46:27.750]  nearly the annoyance I thought it was.
[46:27.890 --> 46:29.710]  But you know what, we haven't finished yet.
[46:29.730 --> 46:30.830]  Shut up, everybody shut up.
[46:31.810 --> 46:33.650]  Why would you do this?
[46:33.750 --> 46:34.830]  Why would you pull in front?
[46:34.830 --> 46:37.070]  Piece of shit.
[46:37.150 --> 46:38.290]  Oh, no!
[46:39.210 --> 46:40.710]  Gavin is the biggest
[46:40.710 --> 46:43.070]  dick in the world.
[46:43.410 --> 46:43.950]  Let's go.
[46:44.570 --> 46:45.090]  Motherfucker.
[46:46.150 --> 46:48.490]  Wait, where's the guy?
[46:48.710 --> 46:49.590]  Did he go back to the truck?
[46:49.870 --> 46:50.770]  He's in, he's in.
[46:51.250 --> 46:52.890]  I need Andrew to get in here.
[46:53.670 --> 46:54.610]  No, I'm in.
[46:55.070 --> 46:56.930]  No, it's him, he's driving.
[46:57.270 --> 46:57.850]  Oh, no!
[46:59.110 --> 46:59.630]  No!
[47:00.510 --> 47:00.910]  No!
[47:01.610 --> 47:03.450]  Why did you do this,
[47:03.650 --> 47:03.970]  Gavin?
[47:04.990 --> 47:06.290]  One more time.
[47:06.890 --> 47:08.290]  We're not doing this again.
[47:10.670 --> 47:11.810]  One more time.
[47:13.010 --> 47:13.670]  Wait, what if
[47:13.670 --> 47:15.590]  we take off, lose the wanted level, and come back?
[47:15.990 --> 47:17.170]  I don't think that's how this works.
[47:17.190 --> 47:18.610]  No, there's no way that'll work.
[47:18.750 --> 47:20.430]  I'm trying!
[47:21.670 --> 47:22.490]  Do a J-turn.
[47:24.130 --> 47:25.250]  Oh, my God.
[47:26.230 --> 47:27.650]  Oh, how could I let you
[47:27.650 --> 47:28.230]  drive?
[47:28.530 --> 47:30.970]  If it helps, I'm really keeping, like, the cops off of you.
[47:31.090 --> 47:33.370]  Can you take all these cops out, and we'll...
[47:33.370 --> 47:34.790]  Don't leave!
[47:35.070 --> 47:35.770]  Don't leave!
[47:36.990 --> 47:39.410]  Leave, leave, and I'll skydive out,
[47:39.450 --> 47:40.130]  and I'll go get him.
[47:40.290 --> 47:40.770]  No!
[47:43.030 --> 47:45.750]  Just go back
[47:45.750 --> 47:46.470]  to him!
[47:46.890 --> 47:49.070]  Turn the plane around!
[47:50.250 --> 47:51.190]  Just take off!
[47:51.350 --> 47:52.410]  I am taking off!
[47:54.050 --> 47:55.630]  And we're not!
[47:59.030 --> 47:59.990]  It's gonna say,
[48:00.030 --> 48:01.750]  you're too far away, you fail.
[48:01.910 --> 48:03.690]  We're circling. That's exactly right.
[48:04.290 --> 48:06.130]  Now, if we turn around...
[48:06.130 --> 48:07.590]  He's following us still!
[48:07.670 --> 48:09.750]  Alright, get some height, get some height, and I'll fly down
[48:09.750 --> 48:11.410]  and I'll get him. Hold on.
[48:11.790 --> 48:13.310]  We'll just land, we'll land, we'll land.
[48:13.410 --> 48:15.590]  No! If you land, there'll be police all over you.
[48:16.050 --> 48:17.050]  Oh, I'm fine, I'll pull up.
[48:17.610 --> 48:18.910]  Alright, just go straight over.
[48:19.010 --> 48:20.730]  Alright, I'm jumping out.
[48:21.610 --> 48:23.330]  Oh, my God, I'm so mad.
[48:24.230 --> 48:24.930]  We're stalling.
[48:24.930 --> 48:27.310]  Low airspeed, we're stalling?
[48:27.430 --> 48:29.050]  Alright, I'm gonna circle back to the other end.
[48:29.970 --> 48:30.950]  Why did you
[48:30.950 --> 48:31.750]  jump out?
[48:32.110 --> 48:33.530]  What does that accomplish?
[48:35.390 --> 48:36.810]  He's driving away!
[48:42.480 --> 48:44.020]  I've never been more mad
[48:44.020 --> 48:44.440]  at Gavin.
[48:46.660 --> 48:47.980]  I was trying to spin
[48:47.980 --> 48:49.420]  that puppy around.
[48:50.000 --> 48:50.900]  Oh, shit.
[48:51.320 --> 48:53.920]  None of anything that you've done
[48:53.920 --> 48:55.960]  has made any sense from the point
[48:55.960 --> 48:57.940]  at which I said, this is pretty easy.
[48:59.460 --> 49:01.380]  Yeah, it's like you saying that kind of
[49:01.900 --> 49:03.240]  fucked us over, didn't it?
[49:04.200 --> 49:05.240]  Don't spin this!
[49:05.360 --> 49:06.800]  This isn't in any way my fault.
[49:07.040 --> 49:08.240]  Stop driving, get out!
[49:09.900 --> 49:10.840]  Oh, no.
[49:11.280 --> 49:11.980]  What happened, guys?
[49:13.100 --> 49:14.680]  I'm busy blowing up
[49:14.680 --> 49:17.800]  a bunch of police helicopters and stuff.
[49:18.180 --> 49:19.600]  I must have missed what happened.
[49:19.640 --> 49:20.200]  What happened, guys?
[49:21.660 --> 49:23.400]  You made me give him an additional
[49:23.800 --> 49:25.100]  5%, Eric, you motherfucker.
[49:25.580 --> 49:29.400]  You made him get paid more for this.
[49:30.180 --> 49:30.620]  Here's what happened.
[49:31.320 --> 49:33.440]  I think Nick and Gavin should
[49:33.440 --> 49:34.960]  give me their money.
[49:35.380 --> 49:36.080]  Here's what happened.
[49:36.460 --> 49:38.600]  I tried to do a skiddy 180, right?
[49:38.740 --> 49:40.240]  So we could be facing the right way.
[49:40.320 --> 49:43.700]  Don't say right like we're gonna agree with any part of what you're about to say.
[49:43.780 --> 49:45.420]  But what happened was, it didn't do
[49:45.420 --> 49:47.680]  a handbrake turn, it just did a very slow turn.
[49:47.780 --> 49:49.200]  So when I went to get out, we were just
[49:49.200 --> 49:51.320]  still driving forwards and I dived out.
[49:51.320 --> 49:53.800]  Yeah, I can't believe the game did that to you.
[49:54.080 --> 49:55.400]  You know what, Gavin, there's no bad ideas.
[49:55.860 --> 49:56.880]  There's no bad ideas yet.
[49:57.280 --> 49:57.760]  Okay.
[49:58.280 --> 49:58.760]  Explain
[50:01.680 --> 50:03.240]  what the purpose
[50:03.240 --> 50:05.200]  was of you jumping out of the
[50:05.200 --> 50:07.280]  airplane if you wanted to
[50:07.280 --> 50:09.420]  leave because the wanted level was up.
[50:09.920 --> 50:11.400]  No, I was hoping we would draw
[50:11.400 --> 50:13.200]  the police away so that there
[50:13.200 --> 50:14.740]  would be no police around the bus.
[50:15.860 --> 50:17.160]  You know how this game works.
[50:17.240 --> 50:18.660]  You're level 130.
[50:18.660 --> 50:20.980]  The police are droning you.
[50:21.380 --> 50:22.700]  I got to him without any police
[50:22.700 --> 50:24.340]  but he just drove away from me.
[50:24.440 --> 50:25.240]  It was his fault.
[50:26.040 --> 50:27.460]  After all the things that were my fault.
[50:27.840 --> 50:29.260]  Oh, it was his fault.
[50:30.060 --> 50:31.460]  I hadn't considered that.
[50:32.760 --> 50:34.800]  I'm taking full-blown responsibility
[50:34.800 --> 50:35.100]  there.
[50:35.500 --> 50:37.680]  Except for the part that was his fault.
[50:37.820 --> 50:39.960]  But, on paper, that could have worked.
[50:40.240 --> 50:41.780]  If there was someone different at the helm,
[50:42.020 --> 50:44.160]  instead of my thumbs, that could have worked out.
[50:44.560 --> 50:44.740]  Okay.
[50:45.580 --> 50:47.120]  I think if there was someone's thumbs
[50:47.120 --> 50:48.760]  on the whole thing, we wouldn't be in this situation.
[50:50.060 --> 50:50.880]  What was so
[50:50.880 --> 50:52.820]  infuriating about that is
[50:52.820 --> 50:54.800]  there were like eight times to correct
[50:54.800 --> 50:56.640]  what happened and it was just ignored
[50:56.640 --> 50:58.640]  at every turn. What would have corrected what happened?
[50:59.300 --> 51:00.860]  We could have not left the
[51:00.860 --> 51:02.660]  airfield. We could have went around and then got
[51:02.660 --> 51:04.620]  next to him. We just had to get close to him
[51:04.620 --> 51:06.640]  but instead we went the opposite
[51:06.640 --> 51:08.360]  direction for some reason.
[51:08.780 --> 51:10.540]  It was all a mess. There were about six
[51:10.540 --> 51:12.760]  police cars around him. By flying
[51:12.760 --> 51:14.820]  away, you took all the police cars away from him.
[51:17.860 --> 51:18.580]  It's fine.
[51:18.940 --> 51:20.140]  No bad ideas.
[51:20.140 --> 51:22.140]  I can tell by the way he said it, he means it.
[51:23.180 --> 51:24.540]  Yeah. No bad ideas.
[51:25.540 --> 51:26.380]  Oh, also, the reason
[51:26.380 --> 51:28.420]  why we got alerted last time early Gavin is
[51:28.420 --> 51:30.720]  I accidentally pulled my gun out and I don't think that's even the end.
[51:30.960 --> 51:32.520]  I just didn't feel like
[51:32.520 --> 51:33.880]  taking the blame at that time.
[51:34.120 --> 51:36.360]  But, after what you just did,
[51:36.400 --> 51:38.360]  it's not even comparable. It's fine.
[51:38.500 --> 51:39.860]  So, I'm not gonna take my gun out.
[51:40.420 --> 51:42.040]  We could spend all day
[51:42.040 --> 51:43.480]  playing the blame game.
[51:43.820 --> 51:45.660]  Yeah, I mean, I blame Nick and then I blame Gavin.
[51:46.720 --> 51:48.300]  That's interesting that you would say that.
[51:48.600 --> 51:49.840]  You know what, that didn't take all day.
[51:49.980 --> 51:50.400]  That was really quick.
[51:51.480 --> 51:53.860]  Hey, do you want to do round two?
[51:54.240 --> 51:55.980]  I blame Nick, I blame Gavin.
[51:57.260 --> 51:58.520]  Wow, he did it twice.
[51:58.900 --> 51:59.980]  Gavin, I blame circumstance.
[52:00.060 --> 52:01.060]  I haven't even had lunch yet.
[52:02.320 --> 52:04.260]  Nick blamed the circumstance?
[52:05.260 --> 52:05.780]  Yeah, circumstance.
[52:06.780 --> 52:08.180]  He said stop to me.
[52:08.600 --> 52:09.460]  You fucking idiot.
[52:09.460 --> 52:11.480]  I don't know what to do.
[52:13.280 --> 52:13.680]  Stop?
[52:15.300 --> 52:15.780]  I did.
[52:16.560 --> 52:17.780]  Did he get angry
[52:17.780 --> 52:18.960]  when you pulled your weapon out?
[52:19.260 --> 52:20.520]  I was already out.
[52:22.200 --> 52:23.560]  Do you think that was the problem?
[52:23.840 --> 52:25.140]  We're not gonna do this again,
[52:25.240 --> 52:27.220]  so we're not gonna find out, but next time,
[52:27.340 --> 52:28.960]  when you do this with a different group of people,
[52:29.620 --> 52:30.500]  try killing them.
[52:30.920 --> 52:33.400]  Do you think anyone else would do this with me ever again
[52:33.400 --> 52:34.420]  after what they've seen today?
[52:34.760 --> 52:36.240]  I don't even want to do this with you now.
[52:37.300 --> 52:37.660]  Exactly.
[52:39.400 --> 52:40.460]  This is the first heist.
[52:44.480 --> 52:46.040]  You know, there are a lot of questions.
[52:48.420 --> 52:51.520]  A lot of finger pointing to go around.
[52:52.000 --> 52:52.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[52:52.900 --> 52:54.820]  None in this direction, but I totally agree with you.
[52:54.860 --> 52:55.140]  There is.
[52:55.580 --> 52:57.720]  You know what, for once, I agree with you.
[52:58.340 --> 53:00.560]  I mean, it's what happens when I'm right.
[53:01.280 --> 53:02.220]  It's just the way it is.
[53:02.540 --> 53:03.640]  Okay, on my way to the buzzard.
[53:04.080 --> 53:04.740]  There's time.
[53:05.300 --> 53:06.440]  I need to eat something.
[53:08.420 --> 53:09.880]  Nick is being
[53:09.880 --> 53:11.620]  scrambled by jets, which means
[53:11.620 --> 53:12.860]  Nick is chasing the jet.
[53:14.640 --> 53:16.100]  Just keeping an eye on him.
[53:16.380 --> 53:18.000]  He's doing great. Nick's doing great.
[53:18.140 --> 53:19.520]  In this situation, Nick is
[53:19.520 --> 53:21.720]  like the best pilot I've ever seen.
[53:22.120 --> 53:23.660]  Oh my god, jets are coming for us.
[53:23.720 --> 53:25.080]  And he's chasing the jet.
[53:25.560 --> 53:27.220]  Yeah, I'll teach that little son of a bitch.
[53:29.080 --> 53:31.540]  My screen is vibrating so much, I can't even see.
[53:31.540 --> 53:32.840]  Alright, he got him.
[53:33.260 --> 53:34.280]  Collecting him again.
[53:36.820 --> 53:37.700]  Hey, you wanna drive?
[53:37.760 --> 53:38.800]  Oh shit!
[53:39.100 --> 53:41.160]  What happened? I got hit.
[53:42.860 --> 53:43.720]  Don't get hit.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.060]  We got flown away in that thing.
[53:46.120 --> 53:47.420]  I'm behind you.
[53:47.500 --> 53:47.760]  I'm coming.
[53:50.280 --> 53:51.240]  It's uh...
[53:51.240 --> 53:52.160]  Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
[53:52.660 --> 53:54.660]  He's going down right here.
[53:55.020 --> 53:56.600]  It's a bit of a sticky wicket.
[53:58.100 --> 53:58.760]  Oh shit.
[54:00.640 --> 54:01.160]  Ow.
[54:02.020 --> 54:02.540]  Um...
[54:02.540 --> 54:03.340]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[54:04.220 --> 54:05.560]  It's not that.
[54:05.840 --> 54:08.400]  It's not you.
[54:09.140 --> 54:09.680]  What's the problem?
[54:10.200 --> 54:12.140]  Well, the plane seems to be smoking.
[54:12.940 --> 54:13.900]  What? That's fine.
[54:14.980 --> 54:16.440]  As long as it's just
[54:16.440 --> 54:17.700]  smoking and nothing else.
[54:17.880 --> 54:18.880]  Well, there is a bit of fire.
[54:20.240 --> 54:21.200]  It's on fire?
[54:21.700 --> 54:22.720]  It looks that way.
[54:25.360 --> 54:26.660]  Okay, how far out
[54:26.660 --> 54:28.160]  would you say that you are?
[54:28.600 --> 54:29.900]  We're about 45 seconds.
[54:30.120 --> 54:31.740]  It's also not responsive at all.
[54:32.200 --> 54:32.620]  What do you mean?
[54:33.140 --> 54:34.680]  Like, I can't get it to turn.
[54:37.140 --> 54:37.940]  And uh...
[54:37.940 --> 54:40.260]  Can I land the helicopter and take it?
[54:41.800 --> 54:42.200]  Uh...
[54:42.740 --> 54:44.760]  No, because we have to get in that specific
[54:44.760 --> 54:46.040]  plane. Yeah, we have to get in the plane.
[54:46.200 --> 54:48.460]  And it's also dying, and also it keeps trying to go
[54:48.460 --> 54:50.580]  straight up, and also I seem to be...
[54:50.580 --> 54:51.500]  Why don't you just land it?
[54:52.380 --> 54:53.540]  Well, here's the thing about that.
[54:53.540 --> 54:55.560]  I seem to be crashing.
[54:56.420 --> 54:57.380]  How do you mean?
[54:58.180 --> 54:58.460]  Oh.
[55:03.740 --> 55:05.180]  We're at the airfield.
[55:07.360 --> 55:09.800]  Where was my 45 second warning?
[55:10.520 --> 55:11.320]  I'm level 13.
[55:12.000 --> 55:12.660]  I'm level 13.
[55:13.240 --> 55:14.820]  I gave the warning.
[55:17.760 --> 55:19.080]  We didn't lose any lives.
[55:19.820 --> 55:21.140]  No, we lost one.
[55:26.580 --> 55:27.000]  Oh.
[55:34.760 --> 55:36.580]  I'm gonna drive through the windmills.
[55:38.560 --> 55:38.980]  Cool.
[55:43.980 --> 55:45.000]  Fucking cool, dude.
[55:48.500 --> 55:50.800]  I told you I didn't want to be the pilot.
[55:50.960 --> 55:51.920]  So fucking cool, dude.
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.200]  When you drove through the windmill, that was so funny.
[55:57.520 --> 55:58.600]  That was so funny.
[56:00.120 --> 56:00.980]  Oh, come on, dude.
[56:01.040 --> 56:02.360]  That was three runs ago.
[56:02.440 --> 56:03.420]  You can't be mad still.
[56:04.140 --> 56:05.440]  Oh, I disagree.
[56:06.260 --> 56:08.780]  Yeah, and maybe the more
[56:08.780 --> 56:10.860]  runs we do, the angrier we can be about it.
[56:11.120 --> 56:11.560]  You know what?
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.240]  Now that I've heard you say that out loud, it makes sense.
[56:15.040 --> 56:15.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:16.700 --> 56:18.160]  Team Titan never would have done that.
[56:18.300 --> 56:18.960]  That's what I'm saying.
[56:21.340 --> 56:22.580]  Don't you leave me out here
[56:22.580 --> 56:23.140]  on this island.
[56:24.440 --> 56:24.880]  Ah.
[56:26.000 --> 56:26.140]  Ah.
[56:26.760 --> 56:28.080]  I'm so sweaty now.
[56:31.160 --> 56:32.840]  My wife just texted me.
[56:32.920 --> 56:34.180]  I forgot all my snacks at work.
[56:34.520 --> 56:37.060]  I could be in a situation right now where I could be
[56:37.060 --> 56:38.760]  putting snacks in a car,
[56:38.880 --> 56:40.860]  driving her the snacks, taking care of my wife.
[56:42.360 --> 56:42.800]  Unfortunately,
[56:43.120 --> 56:44.860]  I'm here like, hey, if you watch this
[56:44.860 --> 56:46.660]  and you're supporting this
[56:46.660 --> 56:48.840]  channel, you can stop.
[56:49.360 --> 56:49.700]  No.
[56:49.700 --> 56:50.440]  No.
[56:51.860 --> 56:53.220]  You know, this might be done.
[56:53.500 --> 56:55.940]  I think this might be it, guys.
[56:58.760 --> 56:59.780]  GTA the movie.
[57:01.640 --> 57:03.080]  On the first heist,
[57:03.300 --> 57:05.060]  I assume they only get harder.
[57:05.700 --> 57:05.880]  No.
[57:07.320 --> 57:07.860]  Yeah.
[57:09.880 --> 57:11.380]  The last one's an absolute bollock.
[57:11.380 --> 57:12.560]  I've never completed the next one.
[57:13.020 --> 57:13.540]  Which one's that one?
[57:14.780 --> 57:17.520]  You end up on bikes going through the cliffs and shit.
[57:17.520 --> 57:17.720]  Oh.
[57:21.460 --> 57:23.000]  Okay, Gavin.
[57:23.900 --> 57:25.580]  Shoot him when we get close.
[57:25.920 --> 57:27.420]  Okay, I'm just gonna get out my
[57:27.420 --> 57:28.240]  silenced gun now.
[57:29.320 --> 57:31.400]  And when he tells us to stop, I'll open up
[57:31.400 --> 57:32.220]  the front of his head.
[57:34.420 --> 57:35.640]  I kind of have a feeling
[57:35.640 --> 57:37.580]  that no matter what, the alarm is supposed to go off
[57:37.580 --> 57:39.500]  there because he complains in the cutscene
[57:39.500 --> 57:41.200]  about hiring professionals.
[57:41.580 --> 57:43.000]  I just think it's unavoidable.
[57:48.870 --> 57:49.190]  Okay.
[57:50.310 --> 57:50.630]  Okay.
[57:51.630 --> 57:51.950]  Uh.
[57:53.030 --> 57:53.350]  Okay.
[57:56.010 --> 57:57.550]  I mean, so far...
[57:57.550 --> 57:59.110]  I have the bus. I'm thinking about driving it
[57:59.110 --> 57:59.710]  into the windmills.
[58:03.430 --> 58:04.150]  I'll meet you there.
[58:05.170 --> 58:06.010]  Okay, well, there we go.
[58:06.310 --> 58:08.830]  And that was nobody's.
[58:08.950 --> 58:10.710]  I need blame. I need that to be blamed.
[58:11.170 --> 58:12.210]  You can put it on Nick if you want.
[58:12.530 --> 58:13.450]  Yeah, you can blame the windmills.
[58:14.190 --> 58:15.210]  Alright, I'll do it.
[58:16.210 --> 58:17.770]  You can tell he didn't have
[58:18.410 --> 58:19.990]  guts behind it. That's sad.
[58:24.490 --> 58:26.170]  Welcome to Motown.
[58:26.470 --> 58:27.850]  Alright, I see you coming. I see you coming.
[58:30.850 --> 58:31.370]  Okay.
[58:31.970 --> 58:34.550]  All clear. Going to collect him.
[58:37.090 --> 58:38.210]  Put my gun away
[58:38.210 --> 58:39.510]  so I run even faster.
[58:40.230 --> 58:41.450]  What's up, buddy?
[58:42.230 --> 58:42.970]  Ah!
[58:43.610 --> 58:45.810]  I watched it happen.
[58:49.870 --> 58:51.010]  What happened?
[58:52.190 --> 58:53.130]  What happened that time?
[58:53.630 --> 58:55.390]  Nick got sideswiped by the jet.
[58:55.850 --> 58:57.250]  The jet flew into me.
[59:01.550 --> 59:02.290]  I...
[59:02.290 --> 59:03.490]  Gavin's legitimately
[59:03.490 --> 59:04.370]  going to run out of ammo.
[59:06.030 --> 59:06.910]  Team Tape.
[59:07.490 --> 59:09.690]  Team Tape.
[59:17.410 --> 59:18.130]  Oh.
[59:18.130 --> 59:19.430]  What the fuck just happened?
[59:20.150 --> 59:20.890]  Uh-oh.
[59:20.990 --> 59:22.230]  Eric failed!
[59:25.070 --> 59:26.410]  That's insane.
[59:27.590 --> 59:28.610]  I equipped...
[59:28.610 --> 59:30.390]  I equipped the sticky bombs
[59:30.390 --> 59:32.270]  before I got in my car,
[59:32.570 --> 59:33.930]  and it kept them equipped
[59:33.930 --> 59:36.530]  when every other time it's been.
[59:36.890 --> 59:39.290]  My gun? That's crazy.
[59:43.350 --> 59:44.530]  Eric's on the board!
[59:44.770 --> 59:46.590]  This is really fucking nuts.
[59:46.810 --> 59:48.610]  This is so nuts.
[59:49.250 --> 59:51.610]  What is happening?
[59:53.810 --> 59:54.330]  Okay.
[59:54.630 --> 59:56.910]  Well, at least we didn't do anything yet.
[59:57.390 --> 59:58.210]  That's fine.
[59:58.510 --> 59:59.970]  For the sake of the audience, can we tell you
[59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.750]  that the last two things we all played together
[01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:03.970]  were Chain Together and Pico Part?
[01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.790]  So this is really another feather in the cap.
[01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:10.490]  Oh, boy.
[01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:13.370]  Hey, you might not want to worry about lunch
[01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.470]  and just start thinking about dinner.
[01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.750]  Yeah, it's done.
[01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:18.090]  My lunch is dead.
[01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:20.710]  My lunch died due to a fan
[01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.490]  about an hour ago.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.450]  How about the next person who fails?
[01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.370]  Nick, no!
[01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:28.470]  This is on you!
[01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:29.910]  You have to just
[01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:33.010]  be the guy that this was on!
[01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.990]  That's you!
[01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:34.650]  Kevin!
[01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:38.490]  What happened?
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.490]  The cops were alerted?
[01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:41.090]  What?
[01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:44.810]  He drove over
[01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:46.030]  a prison guard
[01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:47.630]  on the way to the prison.
[01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.890]  I'm gonna piss my pants!
[01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:52.110]  Oh, that's right! Nick had to piss!
[01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.510]  Oh, it's been so fucking long!
[01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:55.690]  Quick, chug the beer!
[01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:57.690]  Oh, man!
[01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.330]  At least there isn't much
[01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:13.010]  for us to go further back.
[01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:14.730]  We can't regress much.
[01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:15.770]  Shut up! Shut up!
[01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.690]  For us, it's not.
[01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:21.690]  The last time you said that was easy,
[01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:23.790]  Gavin jumped out of a moving vehicle.
[01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:25.190]  Oh, yeah, that was pretty cool.
[01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:27.730]  If the handbrake was decent, we wouldn't be in this predicament.
[01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.810]  Yeah, I can't believe the handbrake was bad.
[01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.430]  Yeah, I can't believe those windmills
[01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:32.030]  keep spinning.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.740]  Now, imagine
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.040]  this was on a hard setting.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.200]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.480]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.600]  No, no, no!
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:46.600]  No!
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.220]  The bus flipped! I shot the guard!
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.780]  It went off a jump!
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:53.640]  No!
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.260]  It's on its side!
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.480]  I can't get in it!
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.640]  What do you mean?
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.300]  Get a car and push it.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.900]  No shit!
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.380]  I'm gonna go up the hill.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.000]  Pffft!
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.100]  I killed the guard.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.000]  The car kept going straight down this hill.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.140]  And it just hit a ramp
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.440]  and tipped. That was it.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.540]  Eric, that's as many
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.440]  fails as Nick.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.660]  I don't know what to tell you on that one, bud.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.820]  That's crazy.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.700]  That was nuts.
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.940]  I am so seamless on this thing, this is so easy
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.340]  and the car just went meh.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.840]  I think we're just gonna tip over this time.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.960]  I was trying to listen out for what the guard was gonna say
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.680]  and then you just started screaming no.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:37.700]  Alright.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.100]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.040]  I'm gonna get to the plane.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.740]  I'm gonna go pee. I'm gonna come back and hop in the plane.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:44.380]  Okay.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.920]  That sounds great. Hey, Nick,
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.980]  I love it. Flawless.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.080]  I can't imagine
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.020]  how that's gonna go wrong, so I'm very
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.660]  excited. Well, I have a
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.820]  7 minute and 52 second window
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.040]  from now
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.160]  to get to the plane.
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:04.380]  Well, it depends
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.300]  on how it goes.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.140]  I think the
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.740]  8th time I'm tripping this bus
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.180]  to the music.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.940]  I just don't believe that we're
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.200]  actually gonna start it anymore.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:20.960]  Oh,
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.120]  nice jump. Good jump.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.740]  See, that's not God there.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.220]  No, not this time.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:34.860]  Okay, I've reached
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.820]  the plane. Okay, go piss.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.300]  Go. Alright. Go piss, girl.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:39.660]  What?
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:41.920]  Just go.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.040]  Do we have
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.980]  to wait for this? You don't think
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.100]  I'm smashing the right trigger right now?
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.040]  And that's a good point.
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.760]  You got me there.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.640]  That was a good point. You think I'm being impatient
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.940]  driving up and then I just get really patient during
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.360]  the game?
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.460]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:07.720]  Okay.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.760]  Eric, everything good?
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.060]  Yeah, so far.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.740]  I'm just picking
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.860]  my spot now where I can shoot
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.320]  the driver.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:18.400]  Alright,
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.920]  I had to cut that off early just to make sure.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.360]  You, like, clenched your piss
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.460]  off? Oh yeah, it hurts. It hurts real bad.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.280]  You had time. You had seven
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.280]  minutes. Well, now I'm down to
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:28.680]  530.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.940]  Did you take the armor, Andrew?
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.700]  No, I didn't. I left it for you.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.160]  Oh.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.060]  I've got no health, though.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.320]  And neither do I.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.160]  Spam it.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.700]  I just spent 104 grand on ammo.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.940]  Oh, shit.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.000]  Snacks.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.100]  Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.540]  We're doing good.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.240]  Alright, we're dancing the dance of death here.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.080]  Keep doing your thing.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.140]  Yeah, I'm not gonna do any sudden movements.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.100]  That's for fucking sure.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.880]  I can't do this yet because the cops are right here.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.260]  Shit.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:08.160]  Oh.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.560]  You're fine. Keep doing your thing.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.280]  Okay, leading him to the
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:13.620]  vehicle.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:16.960]  You here, Gavin?
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.920]  Okay, I'm gonna wait for you to get closer.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.300]  No, get in. I'll be there.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:22.900]  I don't know why
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.840]  I'm listening to you, but I'm listening to your instructions.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.960]  I just wait for him to call it out.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.100]  I'm in.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:32.540]  Okay, we're now leaving the prison.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.440]  Alright, we're on our way out.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:42.780]  How far?
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.440]  We are about 45 seconds.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.520]  Oh god, not again.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.200]  Alright, I'm gonna circle one more time.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.060]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.780]  I'm gonna see if I can take out anything that's close.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.100]  I'm coming to you guys.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:55.980]  I see you dead ahead.
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:58.520]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.280]  Okay, coming in for a landing.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.060]  Cutting into the runway?
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.540]  Yeah, Nick, go ahead and put it down.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:04.300]  Okay.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.000]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.740]  I'm doing everything I can here.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.500]  Yeah, no, it's the missiles is what scared me.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:14.840]  Yeah.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.040]  Okay, we're on our way.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.040]  Okay, I have stopped.
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.600]  Okay, I'm just flipping cop cars.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.420]  I see you, I see you.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.600]  Keep doing it.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.300]  You're good.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.760]  I got all these helicopters.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.660]  Okay, I'm gonna go behind you, Nick.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.520]  I'm gonna cut around Gavin, just so you know.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.780]  I'm gonna end up behind.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.680]  Okay, come around behind.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.300]  I have the door open for you.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.980]  Oh, balls.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.740]  I got him!
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.880]  Yeah, Eric!
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.240]  Hop in, fellas.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.180]  Where's Dipshit?
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.600]  He's coming, he's coming, he's getting in.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:51.600]  Get in!
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.400]  He's glitched.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.380]  He's glitched.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:57.840]  Go!
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.300]  We're off.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.840]  Takeoff, takeoff, takeoff.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.900]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.860]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.320]  You're up.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:08.920]  Okay, go.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:09.700]  They're up.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.900]  Okay, now just start aiming towards the yellow.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.900]  I'm with you, you guys do everything you need to do.
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.660]  I'll try to take these helicopters out.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:17.940]  You're good.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.780]  Okay, everybody...
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.660]  Nick, you have the opportunity
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.580]  to do the funniest thing in the world.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.140]  No!
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.080]  No!
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:32.020]  What kind of person is Nick?
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.860]  Find out in about
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.040]  15 seconds.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.240]  No, no!
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.240]  We're losing the police.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.020]  You're doing good, you're doing good. Keep it going.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.800]  I don't see a goddamn thing.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.040]  I don't know what you're
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:48.640]  talking about.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.060]  Just flying up.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.020]  I'm with you, I'm with you. Keep it going.
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:00.620]  I'm gonna bail out to distract the cops.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.240]  No, we'll fail.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.880]  Right into the fans.
[01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:10.850]  We're so close
[01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:12.530]  to lose the wanted rating.
[01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.230]  Yeah, we're trying.
[01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:16.230]  I'm gonna get out and get in your helicopter.
[01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:18.010]  Die!
[01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.550]  I swear to God.
[01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:20.990]  Oh God.
[01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:23.490]  It's okay.
[01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:26.250]  We're okay.
[01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:27.010]  How high are we supposed to go?
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:30.110]  We're doing great.
[01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:31.210]  We just have to keep going.
[01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.170]  We just gotta keep aiming towards
[01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:35.010]  that yellow dot.
[01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:38.170]  I think this has
[01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:39.150]  us bail out at the end.
[01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:41.890]  What is shoot? What deploys your shoot?
[01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:43.390]  The A button.
[01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:44.590]  What is shoot?
[01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:49.870]  Please
[01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:51.510]  deploy it very early.
[01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:54.270]  Yes, I've seen that first tank.
[01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.170]  We're going to the drop zone.
[01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:57.350]  I think I took out all the helicopters. I think we're good.
[01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.950]  Alright.
[01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:00.790]  Let's see.
[01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.530]  It looks like the wanted level is going away.
[01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:04.710]  Ours is gone.
[01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:06.830]  Mine is just about there.
[01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:08.410]  Regroup on the beach.
[01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:10.030]  Okay.
[01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:11.930]  Use the cops.
[01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.910]  Point break style.
[01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.630]  There we go.
[01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:19.650]  Still got your handcuffs on.
[01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:19.890]  Later.
[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:23.370]  When would I have had time to take
[01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:23.750]  them off?
[01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:28.390]  Alright.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.500]  Okay.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.080]  Does this look cool?
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.840]  That looks pretty awesome.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:45.900]  Don't land
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:46.740]  in the chopper blades.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.860]  I've seen that
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.520]  on this state. I've seen that
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.420]  on hard mode.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.040]  Wait for your team to arrive at the beach. A seagull
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.880]  just flew into my chopper blades.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:00.860]  Just stay clear.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.220]  Land in the water if you need to.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.420]  Don't land up top.
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.940]  Well, I guess you can. It might just be harder
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.400]  to get down here, but I'm here.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:09.900]  How do you make
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:10.600]  a soft landing?
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.860]  Pull back on the stick.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.700]  And just don't land in the chopper blades.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.240]  Just get out
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.160]  of the helicopter to stop the blades.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.600]  Are you going to hop in or what?
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:26.920]  Oh!
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.440]  Gavin!
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.260]  Look at that!
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:30.280]  Oh!
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.020]  That shit was not funny.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.000]  I almost ran
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.620]  into the rotor. Holy God.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.100]  The tail rotor.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.680]  You would have died
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.640]  because of the rotor.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.980]  Okay, now we just got to get back to the city.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.300]  I am so stressed.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:54.980]  No!
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.760]  Take us to the windmill farm.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.900]  Take us to the windmill farm.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.920]  Shut the fuck up!
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.000]  Just on the other side of this mountain.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.000]  There's so many fans.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.140]  What? It's fun.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.640]  My air conditioning was just fixed.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.640]  I appreciate it. Don't need to see it.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:13.840]  All good.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.060]  Oh!
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.360]  Thank God!
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:21.740]  Oh my God!
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.120]  Oh!
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.100]  We did it!
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.000]  We did it, team!
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.900]  Heist passed!
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.980]  That's right, Blandom.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.300]  I deserve bronze. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.360]  Is there anything lower than bronze
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.120]  that we can give you? An accurate rating.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.300]  I bet you want to use that immunity bullet, don't you?
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.320]  Yeah!
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.700]  I got hot bun.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.100]  Me too.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.180]  Yeah!
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.240]  High fives. High fives all around.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.700]  Rat crew. Way to go, rats.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:01.740]  Oh, man.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:04.520]  Clink in those glasses.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.680]  We're the rat pack.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.980]  We are the rat pack. That is no other group.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.100]  It is only us.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.500]  Thank you so much for watching
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.600]  this gameplay. I hope you
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.520]  enjoyed it. Friendships may have been
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.280]  broken here, but we'll come together.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.660]  Love isn't gone, it's just lost.
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.640]  We gotta find it. We'll find it again.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.540]  We'll be back soon. If you want to check out
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.120]  our podcast, we are the Regulation Pod.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.720]  Want to check out our Patreon?
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.200]  The Regulation Podcast on Patreon.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.240]  I think that's it.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:34.940]  Or what? Regulatrion.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.620]  Regulatrion. That's right.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.800]  Thanks, Gavin. I am fried,
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.180]  so I forgot that.
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.480]  But we remembered it.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.920]  Because that's what a squad does.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.500]  Get out of my face.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.720]  Get out of his face.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.840]  From the angle I'm at,
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.040]  that's not what it looked like
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.120]  you wanted to suck on.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.720]  It looked like a wild time.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.520]  Go rats!
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.320]  We're out.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:00.600]  Bye!
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.000]  I'm really sorry.
