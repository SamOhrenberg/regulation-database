[00:00.000 --> 00:03.540]  Yeah, I wonder what my funny username would have been if I didn't just always have my name.
[00:04.180 --> 00:05.120]  Yeah, right. Same.
[00:05.300 --> 00:09.420]  Because it's like, I don't know, it's it's very it's interesting.
[00:09.560 --> 00:10.940]  You can kind of like go anywhere with it.
[00:12.020 --> 00:13.080]  I think I'd be like a tub.
[00:13.380 --> 00:13.680]  It's one of your worms names.
[00:14.540 --> 00:17.240]  Yeah, or like tub nugs or something.
[00:18.200 --> 00:18.820]  Tub nugs?
[00:20.320 --> 00:24.180]  I've been using, uh, if it's a game that I don't think like
[00:24.180 --> 00:27.740]  my name needs to be attached to, I've been using Ratsodogbrains.
[00:27.900 --> 00:28.980]  And that feels pretty good.
[00:31.740 --> 00:34.780]  Because it's like, oh, you'd like you just died to Ratsodogbrains.
[00:34.880 --> 00:38.320]  Like in an online game, you just go, who the fuck is Ratsodogbrains?
[00:38.460 --> 00:39.920]  And it makes you feel bad.
[00:40.140 --> 00:41.960]  I don't want to use tub nugs anymore,
[00:42.480 --> 00:45.440]  because Janera said tub nugs is when you shit in the bath.
[00:47.460 --> 00:50.160]  No. Yeah, that does sound like that's what it is.
