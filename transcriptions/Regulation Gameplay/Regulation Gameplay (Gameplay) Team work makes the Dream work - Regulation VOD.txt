[00:00.000 --> 00:03.320]  Alright, I think we're live now. Andrew, you're- you can host. Go ahead and you can talk.
[00:04.200 --> 00:06.900]  Why would I talk? This is Gavin's game, but I'm talking now.
[00:06.980 --> 00:11.720]  We're playing Pico Park. Little walk in the park. I'm a little cat man.
[00:12.780 --> 00:16.280]  I'm a cat man. That is, yeah, how it goes.
[00:16.400 --> 00:17.700]  I'm the cat man.
[00:18.040 --> 00:22.140]  Uh, do we want to say who's who? Like, uh, how does it look on the screen?
[00:22.260 --> 00:25.360]  Oh, it's on the screen. I'm pretty blended in, as Nick said I would be.
[00:25.480 --> 00:28.020]  I'm red. I'm the red cat. Nick is...
[00:28.020 --> 00:33.020]  The purple cat. Eric is the green cat. Geoff is the orange cat. Gavin...
[00:33.020 --> 00:34.920]  Are we cats? No. I don't know.
[00:34.940 --> 00:36.900]  These are definitely cats. Get out of here.
[00:37.340 --> 00:42.180]  Can I just say, can I just say real fast, I've never seen an episode of Suits before,
[00:42.340 --> 00:46.140]  but I promise you I never will because of these fucking T-Mobile ads.
[00:46.140 --> 00:49.540]  Oh, they're the worst. Oh, it's crazy. Oh my fucking god.
[00:49.840 --> 00:53.820]  I get TikToks all day long that are clips from the show Suits,
[00:53.940 --> 00:56.400]  and it's the most I've ever seen from the show Suits.
[00:56.400 --> 00:59.500]  God damn. What a fucking lifespan that show had.
[00:59.680 --> 01:02.680]  Nobody watched it when it was around. One of them became a princess,
[01:02.880 --> 01:05.140]  and the other two get to have a commercial career three years later.
[01:05.140 --> 01:08.140]  A fucking T-Mobile commercial. Yeah, that's so funny.
[01:08.140 --> 01:13.000]  Alright, I guess we'll start the game once I see some piss rats in the chat, and then that's all.
[01:13.620 --> 01:14.820]  What do you mean? What are you talking about?
[01:14.860 --> 01:17.320]  Put those piss rats in the chat. Yeah, can we get a piss rat in the chat?
[01:17.420 --> 01:19.780]  Wait, wait, we have... Oh, do we have it in emote?
[01:19.980 --> 01:23.220]  Shout out to Cade who made the piss rat in chat.
[01:23.220 --> 01:27.300]  Oh! There's also corn cat?
[01:27.540 --> 01:30.260]  I got a corn cat in there as well. Awesome.
[01:31.960 --> 01:35.920]  Dude, that rocks. I'm gonna show my wife and she's gonna fucking hate it.
[01:35.960 --> 01:37.800]  She hates corn cats so much.
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.520]  We got corn cats, we got piss rats.
[01:39.960 --> 01:41.240]  Why should we hate corn cats?
[01:41.460 --> 01:43.060]  We got corn cats, we got piss rats.
[01:43.800 --> 01:44.720]  Alright, let's go over.
[01:46.540 --> 01:48.160]  Hey, Orange. Wake up.
[01:48.280 --> 01:50.080]  Geoff. Hey, I was just adjusting my audio.
[01:50.100 --> 01:50.660]  Hey, T-Mobile.
[01:51.920 --> 01:54.800]  Sorry, I was trying to make Nick's life easier.
[01:55.600 --> 01:56.220]  Oh, shit.
[01:56.440 --> 01:57.380]  Stop, stop.
[01:59.160 --> 02:00.500]  Who keeps killing him?
[02:00.820 --> 02:01.200]  There you go.
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.220]  Build off of my foundation.
[02:05.660 --> 02:06.900]  It's gonna be a long...
[02:06.900 --> 02:08.920]  Alright, now Purple, you come up.
[02:09.000 --> 02:09.680]  No, no, no.
[02:10.260 --> 02:12.540]  Jump all the way across and hit the fucking button.
[02:13.020 --> 02:13.460]  Yay.
[02:14.740 --> 02:15.620]  Stupid idiot.
[02:17.560 --> 02:18.720]  Alright, let's get that key.
[02:18.720 --> 02:19.900]  That was really funny.
[02:19.980 --> 02:25.220]  Oh my god. Come on, guys. You can figure this part out.
[02:25.420 --> 02:27.620]  Yeah, the lift goes up when we go.
[02:27.880 --> 02:29.580]  The lift goes up when we go.
[02:29.600 --> 02:31.660]  I feel like we could've just reached that ourselves too.
[02:31.860 --> 02:33.860]  I agree. That's what I was trying to do.
[02:34.040 --> 02:35.340]  The lift is mainly for the door.
[02:36.860 --> 02:37.640]  Let's get out of here.
[02:38.260 --> 02:38.980]  Fucking bastards.
[02:39.820 --> 02:41.600]  How do we go through the door?
[02:41.780 --> 02:42.180]  Oh, up.
[02:43.080 --> 02:45.080]  Oh, we have to come back for you.
[02:45.600 --> 02:46.480]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[02:46.480 --> 02:48.400]  Yeah, you fucking idiots.
[02:48.560 --> 02:50.240]  I thought it would just go forward.
[02:51.060 --> 02:51.960]  How do I get out?
[02:52.020 --> 02:52.400]  I'm helping.
[02:53.480 --> 02:54.460]  Nick, come out.
[02:54.780 --> 02:57.020]  Nick, get out of there.
[02:57.200 --> 02:58.540]  Step into the light.
[02:59.880 --> 03:02.160]  The opposite of what you did to go in.
[03:02.700 --> 03:04.400]  I pressed up to go in.
[03:04.760 --> 03:06.300]  I couldn't figure out...
[03:06.300 --> 03:06.780]  Get off that.
[03:08.780 --> 03:09.660]  Jesus Christ.
[03:09.960 --> 03:13.640]  Hey guys, if you're shocked by how we're doing here,
[03:13.800 --> 03:14.640]  wait until you see our
[03:14.640 --> 03:16.720]  chain-together gameplay in a little while.
[03:16.800 --> 03:17.660]  Oh, Jesus.
[03:18.540 --> 03:19.960]  Do we know yet?
[03:20.720 --> 03:21.760]  Let's just stick it out.
[03:23.860 --> 03:25.060]  Chat is asking
[03:25.060 --> 03:25.880]  if Nick is muted.
[03:26.260 --> 03:26.920]  I don't know.
[03:28.320 --> 03:29.680]  Can you hear Geoff?
[03:30.420 --> 03:31.480]  How do I sound?
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.760]  When does chain-together come out?
[03:34.960 --> 03:35.280]  Do we know?
[03:36.040 --> 03:37.760]  It probably won't be for another week, right?
[03:39.720 --> 03:40.360]  Oh, here we go.
[03:40.940 --> 03:42.420]  Drop that motherfucker down the hole.
[03:42.420 --> 03:43.360]  Yeah, down the hole.
[03:43.580 --> 03:44.140]  Hang on.
[03:45.100 --> 03:45.520]  Nice.
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.480]  Dude, we're doing so much good push work.
[03:51.580 --> 03:52.380]  We're killing it.
[03:52.780 --> 03:53.340]  Hang on.
[03:55.580 --> 03:57.460]  We have to push it back the other way.
[03:58.280 --> 03:58.900]  We do?
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.260]  So that way the blue guy can ride on it, right?
[04:02.400 --> 04:03.180]  I'm the blue guy.
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.040]  I have a name.
[04:05.020 --> 04:06.340]  I don't know what color you are.
[04:06.900 --> 04:08.180]  He couldn't jump over it.
[04:08.180 --> 04:08.700]  Come on.
[04:11.920 --> 04:13.320]  I don't know what color anyone is.
[04:14.020 --> 04:15.480]  I just know green is Eric.
[04:15.700 --> 04:18.640]  The other colors are interchangeable.
[04:19.640 --> 04:20.460]  I was going to ask you guys
[04:20.460 --> 04:21.920]  that in the podcast, but I didn't get around to it.
[04:22.100 --> 04:23.600]  What is the worst smell?
[04:25.660 --> 04:26.020]  You.
[04:27.540 --> 04:28.120]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:28.120 --> 04:28.320]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:30.800 --> 04:31.920]  Orange a little bit.
[04:32.020 --> 04:33.300]  There you go. Purple, get up there.
[04:33.440 --> 04:34.900]  Why did you kill me?
[04:35.500 --> 04:36.520]  Uh-oh, I'm trapped.
[04:37.700 --> 04:39.180]  You guys are idiots.
[04:40.040 --> 04:41.920]  Whoever was green just got away with that.
[04:42.080 --> 04:42.640]  Yeah, me.
[04:43.100 --> 04:43.860]  That was a good move.
[04:44.220 --> 04:45.380]  Eric, the important one.
[04:47.220 --> 04:48.280]  There you go.
[04:48.300 --> 04:48.560]  One more.
[04:49.280 --> 04:50.200]  Nice job.
[04:53.380 --> 04:54.340]  So uncomplicated.
[04:55.040 --> 04:57.080]  But made difficult for some reason.
[04:57.100 --> 04:57.940]  We're almost done with the game.
[04:59.520 --> 05:02.360]  This is how Chain Together went too, guys.
[05:02.360 --> 05:02.780]  Don't worry.
[05:03.760 --> 05:04.160]  No.
[05:05.500 --> 05:05.840]  No.
[05:06.620 --> 05:08.260]  I was watching some guy play it on TikTok.
[05:08.740 --> 05:09.140]  TikTok.
[05:10.820 --> 05:12.120]  TikTok a little bit earlier.
[05:15.080 --> 05:16.840]  We have a long way to go in that game.
[05:17.400 --> 05:17.600]  Yeah.
[05:17.960 --> 05:19.300]  I think it's done.
[05:20.520 --> 05:21.840]  Quick, get on the thing, quick.
[05:21.900 --> 05:22.940]  Get on the thing.
[05:25.080 --> 05:25.480]  Basic.
[05:26.420 --> 05:26.960]  Got it.
[05:27.860 --> 05:29.120]  Bring it down, you.
[05:29.920 --> 05:31.260]  Who jumped off?
[05:31.880 --> 05:32.500]  Who's purple?
[05:33.100 --> 05:34.100]  I jumped off.
[05:35.180 --> 05:36.940]  Why would you jump off?
[05:37.120 --> 05:38.340]  To let you go back up.
[05:39.180 --> 05:40.620]  Now we can't all be on it.
[05:41.940 --> 05:42.320]  Here we can.
[05:42.680 --> 05:43.460]  I guess we briefly can.
[05:45.500 --> 05:47.100]  Get back down, purple.
[05:49.720 --> 05:51.760]  So uncomplicated, made complicated.
[05:51.900 --> 05:53.120]  Oh, it's so uncomplicated.
[05:53.900 --> 05:57.100]  The best part of these teamwork games
[05:57.100 --> 05:58.560]  is how much Eric just wants to
[05:59.560 --> 06:00.680]  be anywhere else.
[06:01.160 --> 06:07.120]  I didn't want to be the last one
[06:07.120 --> 06:07.680]  through the door.
[06:08.460 --> 06:09.980]  Yeah, they smell like a rotten egg.
[06:10.500 --> 06:11.660]  Which is one of the worst smells.
[06:12.760 --> 06:15.060]  Have you ever burnt eggs before?
[06:15.280 --> 06:15.920]  It is bad.
[06:16.220 --> 06:18.120]  Have you ever popped an egg and put it on your ceiling?
[06:18.900 --> 06:19.140]  No.
[06:19.720 --> 06:21.040]  Have you ever what?
[06:21.620 --> 06:22.260]  Popped an egg.
[06:23.620 --> 06:24.620]  Popped an egg?
[06:25.120 --> 06:26.380]  Yeah, like cooked an egg.
[06:26.540 --> 06:27.160]  And it pops.
[06:27.540 --> 06:28.100]  No!
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.440]  Nick, we're in hell!
[06:32.860 --> 06:33.760]  Nick, we're in hell!
[06:33.980 --> 06:35.360]  I'll lead the way again.
[06:37.220 --> 06:37.780]  Alright.
[06:38.340 --> 06:39.680]  Oh no!
[06:40.460 --> 06:41.160]  Pull me up!
[06:41.520 --> 06:42.260]  Pull me up!
[06:45.780 --> 06:47.280]  Pull me up!
[06:48.020 --> 06:49.840]  Wait, is Geoff one of the guys down there?
[06:49.840 --> 06:51.140]  Pull me up!
[06:51.260 --> 06:52.040]  Of course!
[06:54.220 --> 06:55.340]  Hang on!
[06:55.940 --> 06:58.060]  There's an order we have to go in.
[06:59.480 --> 06:59.880]  There you go.
[07:00.340 --> 07:01.420]  There we go.
[07:02.120 --> 07:04.200]  Blue has to lead!
[07:04.640 --> 07:05.200]  You fool!
[07:06.640 --> 07:07.600]  We gotta go down there.
[07:08.320 --> 07:08.820]  Hang on.
[07:11.400 --> 07:13.580]  Red, you go up.
[07:13.860 --> 07:14.540]  You idiot!
[07:15.400 --> 07:16.500]  I was already down!
[07:16.500 --> 07:17.560]  Alright, here we go.
[07:17.780 --> 07:19.820]  There, it worked.
[07:20.540 --> 07:23.360]  Oh, is this gonna suck me back as soon as I step down?
[07:24.580 --> 07:26.300]  Not all of us had to go up.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.100]  I don't know why we all decided to go down like this.
[07:30.300 --> 07:32.080]  It'll be fine.
[07:33.440 --> 07:35.800]  Oh, the key!
[07:37.600 --> 07:38.000]  Stop!
[07:38.700 --> 07:39.640]  I got pushed!
[07:40.460 --> 07:41.500]  I didn't try.
[07:43.420 --> 07:44.340]  Stop pushing me!
[07:44.340 --> 07:45.320]  Orange, go to the top.
[07:45.380 --> 07:46.320]  Here, pull him up.
[07:46.680 --> 07:50.140]  Orange, you go to the top.
[07:50.680 --> 07:51.880]  I can't get to the top of Blue.
[07:51.880 --> 07:53.060]  Pull him back up!
[07:54.260 --> 07:54.660]  Orange.
[07:55.500 --> 07:57.000]  Let him jump on somebody.
[07:58.080 --> 08:00.120]  I gotta jump on somebody!
[08:00.340 --> 08:00.440]  Red!
[08:01.920 --> 08:02.320]  There.
[08:03.280 --> 08:04.520]  Two of us down here.
[08:05.220 --> 08:07.920]  Alright, three's heavier than two. We got this.
[08:08.100 --> 08:09.780]  Yes, exactly. Then you pull us up.
[08:11.480 --> 08:11.740]  There we go.
[08:11.740 --> 08:13.100]  Look at that textbook.
[08:13.440 --> 08:15.520]  Again, so uncomplicated.
[08:16.420 --> 08:16.940]  Well, you know.
[08:17.660 --> 08:19.000]  I'll never...
[08:19.000 --> 08:19.860]  You know what?
[08:20.800 --> 08:22.780]  You know how couples put together puzzles sometimes?
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.060]  I imagine Eric would get a divorce after that.
[08:25.580 --> 08:26.720]  No way! It's mine!
[08:26.720 --> 08:28.820]  He won't even compete in our puzzle-off.
[08:29.000 --> 08:29.440]  I know!
[08:29.880 --> 08:31.360]  God, no. Puzzles.
[08:31.660 --> 08:32.680]  Oh, shit.
[08:34.620 --> 08:35.440]  I'm outta here.
[08:36.840 --> 08:38.360]  I'm trying to win! Come on!
[08:38.360 --> 08:40.360]  So we need to go as a totem pole.
[08:40.980 --> 08:41.120]  Yeah.
[08:41.960 --> 08:43.920]  You just start the whole thing over?
[08:44.320 --> 08:45.600]  How did it know we were dead?
[08:46.100 --> 08:47.300]  Yeah, that one was on me. Hop on.
[08:47.800 --> 08:48.040]  Hop on.
[08:49.240 --> 08:52.200]  Hop on. There you go.
[08:52.880 --> 08:54.200]  Alright, green's gonna have to do the driving.
[08:54.740 --> 08:56.260]  Alright, blue figured the fuck out.
[08:56.300 --> 08:56.980]  Here we go. Ready?
[08:57.400 --> 09:00.420]  Alright, orange at the very... Okay, I guess red at the very top.
[09:00.900 --> 09:02.520]  Again, not complicated.
[09:02.700 --> 09:03.920]  Made complicated for some reason.
[09:04.080 --> 09:04.960]  We're gonna go all the way.
[09:04.960 --> 09:05.520]  I was scared.
[09:05.720 --> 09:08.980]  Red, you're gonna jump up, grab the key, and just keep moving right.
[09:09.080 --> 09:09.840]  Ready? Here we go.
[09:13.220 --> 09:13.660]  Nice.
[09:14.300 --> 09:16.040]  Oh, God. Why have you done that?
[09:18.600 --> 09:18.920]  Alright.
[09:19.420 --> 09:20.500]  Easy. It worked out.
[09:21.380 --> 09:22.260]  Absolutely insane.
[09:22.580 --> 09:24.600]  Will you move for the man to unlock it? Thank you.
[09:24.860 --> 09:25.700]  Jesus Christ.
[09:27.620 --> 09:28.480]  There's no problem.
[09:30.180 --> 09:31.220]  Nick was the rotten egg.
[09:31.220 --> 09:33.220]  Oh, Nick, you smell like shit.
[09:33.340 --> 09:35.460]  No! Not me.
[09:36.300 --> 09:37.240]  I am sweating now.
[09:37.780 --> 09:38.700]  Oh, hang on. Hang on. Wait.
[09:39.020 --> 09:39.620]  Going for it.
[09:40.300 --> 09:43.060]  Dude, this game is making me sweat, too. It's like yesterday all over again.
[09:43.600 --> 09:45.600]  Hey, you guys just saw that
[09:45.600 --> 09:46.340]  where Gavin said,
[09:46.780 --> 09:49.180]  going for it? That was
[09:49.180 --> 09:50.100]  chained together yesterday.
[09:50.280 --> 09:52.500]  Alright, hold on. I need momentum.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.140]  Pull me back up. I need to jump
[09:55.140 --> 09:57.200]  off. Well, I can't swing out,
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.480]  so I need to get some beans.
[09:58.480 --> 09:58.920]  Alright.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.480]  Everyone stay on the edge, and then me and
[10:02.480 --> 10:03.420]  Orange will go for it.
[10:04.040 --> 10:06.480]  3, 2, 1, go for it!
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.020]  Oh, fuck.
[10:08.540 --> 10:10.100]  Okay, when they go for it...
[10:10.100 --> 10:11.000]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[10:11.080 --> 10:14.560]  You fucking idiot. Stop.
[10:14.820 --> 10:16.000]  Now you go.
[10:17.920 --> 10:20.460]  It's faster. It's faster. It's faster to restart
[10:20.460 --> 10:20.860]  that way.
[10:22.160 --> 10:24.560]  We need to move in this direction,
[10:24.720 --> 10:26.440]  but when they go down, we need to go right.
[10:26.440 --> 10:28.240]  So we need to move further to the left.
[10:29.200 --> 10:30.280]  Keep going to the left.
[10:30.580 --> 10:30.880]  Alright, jump.
[10:31.200 --> 10:34.540]  Okay, so when I said
[10:34.540 --> 10:36.760]  move to the right, what you heard is move to the left.
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.540]  Yeah, that was pretty clearly to the left.
[10:39.060 --> 10:40.080]  Yeah, that was me.
[10:40.960 --> 10:42.140]  Well, at least you can admit it.
[10:42.360 --> 10:44.600]  Okay, we're gonna move. Andrew, keep going left.
[10:45.380 --> 10:45.900]  3, 2, 1, go!
[10:47.020 --> 10:47.840]  Nailed it! Nailed it!
[10:50.360 --> 10:51.000]  Good hands.
[10:52.680 --> 10:53.020]  Alright.
[10:53.020 --> 10:53.240]  Alright.
[10:54.740 --> 10:55.660]  Straight down.
[10:55.820 --> 10:57.500]  We need to go the other way, don't we?
[10:57.820 --> 10:58.940]  No, this is good.
[10:59.160 --> 11:01.320]  I need to be where purple is.
[11:01.560 --> 11:04.180]  What do you mean? We'll get there.
[11:04.520 --> 11:06.180]  Look, there you go.
[11:06.380 --> 11:08.340]  Now you get to...
[11:08.930 --> 11:09.380]  Hold on.
[11:11.040 --> 11:11.960]  Uh-oh.
[11:12.640 --> 11:13.680]  Now somebody else has to do it.
[11:13.920 --> 11:16.320]  Hang on. Hang on.
[11:16.400 --> 11:16.860]  Purple won!
[11:18.300 --> 11:20.360]  Why is orange still going?
[11:20.360 --> 11:21.260]  Geoff, wait!
[11:21.820 --> 11:23.660]  I'm not moving, you guys are pulling me.
[11:23.940 --> 11:25.380]  Alright, jump on me, blue.
[11:25.440 --> 11:28.240]  My hand is not even on the keyboard.
[11:32.960 --> 11:34.240]  Move to the right.
[11:34.520 --> 11:35.860]  You didn't want me to move!
[11:38.140 --> 11:39.020]  Green, green.
[11:39.420 --> 11:40.080]  Get on me.
[11:41.020 --> 11:41.820]  Don't move.
[11:41.940 --> 11:43.180]  Don't move.
[11:43.500 --> 11:44.960]  Now you guys pull. There you go.
[11:47.420 --> 11:48.460]  There we go.
[11:48.460 --> 11:50.020]  Now pull. There we go.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.360]  Oh, I got the egg.
[11:53.540 --> 11:54.660]  That was my first egg.
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.060]  Oh, easy.
[11:55.460 --> 11:57.620]  If you like this, check out Chain Together.
[11:59.260 --> 12:00.740]  It's so much worse.
[12:00.900 --> 12:02.200]  It's so much worse.
[12:03.460 --> 12:04.160]  Oh, we're not...
[12:04.160 --> 12:05.520]  Thank God we're not tethered.
[12:05.920 --> 12:06.900]  Wait, wait, wait.
[12:08.300 --> 12:09.660]  Alright, so we need a lovely stack.
[12:10.480 --> 12:12.460]  Hang on, I need to...
[12:13.260 --> 12:14.540]  There we go. Thank you.
[12:15.140 --> 12:16.300]  I'm good with this. Let's just go.
[12:16.300 --> 12:18.260]  Let's just see what we have to do and we'll do it again.
[12:18.680 --> 12:19.000]  Okay.
[12:20.300 --> 12:20.940]  Oh, good.
[12:22.880 --> 12:23.520]  Alright, boys.
[12:24.440 --> 12:25.600]  Alright, take us all the way.
[12:26.340 --> 12:28.640]  All the way down. Hang on, I'll grab the key and come back.
[12:29.040 --> 12:30.380]  Okay, you'll grab the key and come back.
[12:31.760 --> 12:32.380]  All the way.
[12:32.540 --> 12:32.940]  There we go.
[12:34.920 --> 12:35.760]  Look at that.
[12:36.740 --> 12:38.420]  That was a team effort.
[12:38.900 --> 12:39.820]  That one was a good one.
[12:40.540 --> 12:41.420]  That was gorgeous.
[12:42.760 --> 12:44.220]  On that level, no notes.
[12:44.980 --> 12:45.500]  Yeah.
[12:47.720 --> 12:48.740]  Somebody in the comments said,
[12:48.900 --> 12:49.960]  I love Eric's frustration.
[12:50.180 --> 12:51.060]  Why are we doing this again?
[12:52.360 --> 12:53.100]  Wait, what's happening?
[12:53.380 --> 12:54.620]  Why did we replay it?
[12:56.280 --> 12:57.100]  Level select.
[13:01.120 --> 13:02.160]  Time limit.
[13:02.540 --> 13:03.260]  Oh, Jesus.
[13:03.420 --> 13:03.980]  Let's do it.
[13:04.720 --> 13:05.100]  No.
[13:07.560 --> 13:08.480]  Plenty of time.
[13:08.880 --> 13:09.400]  What?
[13:09.400 --> 13:11.780]  Collect them.
[13:12.700 --> 13:13.540]  Move left.
[13:13.760 --> 13:14.000]  Move left.
[13:17.120 --> 13:17.820]  Move right.
[13:18.640 --> 13:18.900]  Jump.
[13:19.920 --> 13:20.700]  Here we go.
[13:21.920 --> 13:22.540]  Okay, me and orange.
[13:23.180 --> 13:24.100]  Who's green with me?
[13:24.220 --> 13:25.040]  We got it.
[13:25.180 --> 13:27.160]  We're going high.
[13:30.400 --> 13:31.320]  You guys got it?
[13:31.780 --> 13:32.380]  Me and you, Nick.
[13:33.640 --> 13:34.560]  Alright, let's just get it.
[13:35.160 --> 13:35.780]  They got it.
[13:35.780 --> 13:36.360]  They got it.
[13:36.620 --> 13:37.980]  The key.
[13:38.500 --> 13:40.500]  To the right.
[13:41.800 --> 13:43.060]  Let him get to the key.
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.640]  He grabbed it.
[13:44.740 --> 13:45.580]  Why do I have it?
[13:59.520 --> 14:00.420]  Move left.
[14:01.700 --> 14:02.300]  Left.
[14:06.020 --> 14:07.600]  Get off of me.
[14:09.240 --> 14:09.680]  God.
[14:11.800 --> 14:13.780]  This is a mess.
[14:14.840 --> 14:15.980]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[14:16.480 --> 14:17.320]  I got the key.
[14:17.480 --> 14:18.480]  I opened the door last time.
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.200]  I don't want to hear it.
[14:22.400 --> 14:25.320]  I'm up with you.
[14:25.800 --> 14:25.980]  Go.
[14:27.820 --> 14:28.260]  Alright.
[14:29.280 --> 14:30.340]  We got to get these other ones.
[14:31.360 --> 14:32.060]  We got it.
[14:32.060 --> 14:32.760]  We got it.
[14:33.280 --> 14:35.300]  One person is going to grab the key.
[14:37.060 --> 14:37.660]  Go.
[14:38.280 --> 14:39.600]  I don't want it.
[14:39.880 --> 14:40.340]  Go.
[14:41.940 --> 14:43.580]  What are you doing?
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.260]  You fucking idiots.
[14:47.840 --> 14:49.080]  Just go right.
[14:49.460 --> 14:50.200]  Go left.
[14:50.640 --> 14:51.060]  Go left.
[14:51.180 --> 14:53.020]  I can't believe y'all fucked that up.
[14:53.060 --> 14:55.360]  Even if you touch it for a split second.
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.020]  Get on him.
[14:57.360 --> 14:57.720]  Left.
[14:59.000 --> 14:59.360]  Alright.
[14:59.520 --> 14:59.960]  Here we go.
[15:03.740 --> 15:04.460]  Stack him.
[15:06.880 --> 15:07.240]  Alright.
[15:07.900 --> 15:08.580]  I'll go top.
[15:11.000 --> 15:11.360]  Okay.
[15:12.040 --> 15:13.220]  We got to go this way, Geoff.
[15:14.680 --> 15:15.620]  There we go.
[15:15.700 --> 15:16.340]  I'm with you, Nick.
[15:17.940 --> 15:19.100]  I'm getting out of the way.
[15:19.340 --> 15:21.620]  I want to get my dumb little body over here.
[15:22.340 --> 15:22.700]  Okay.
[15:24.660 --> 15:25.200]  Let's go.
[15:25.200 --> 15:26.880]  Go, go, go.
[15:27.640 --> 15:28.660]  Alright, everybody in the door.
[15:29.200 --> 15:30.780]  Damn, fucking green stinks.
[15:31.740 --> 15:34.340]  I don't give a fuck what I smell like after that one.
[15:34.440 --> 15:35.140]  Get me out of here.
[15:36.680 --> 15:37.400]  Alright, here we go.
[15:37.640 --> 15:39.060]  There's three more.
[15:41.480 --> 15:42.600]  Oh my God.
[15:42.880 --> 15:43.880]  What the fuck?
[15:44.360 --> 15:46.160]  Hit all the buttons.
[15:46.960 --> 15:48.520]  We need to come up top.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.180]  They're at the top.
[15:52.000 --> 15:52.860]  We missed it.
[15:52.860 --> 15:54.640]  We just need to see what else there is
[15:54.640 --> 15:55.700]  while we're going to lose.
[15:56.320 --> 15:56.800]  You're right.
[15:59.360 --> 16:01.140]  Who wants to come up top with me?
[16:01.280 --> 16:01.480]  Me.
[16:02.700 --> 16:03.940]  Let's see. Me and red.
[16:06.100 --> 16:06.820]  Hit that.
[16:07.080 --> 16:07.720]  Okay, here we go.
[16:08.480 --> 16:09.380]  I'm coming back down.
[16:11.280 --> 16:11.640]  Stack.
[16:13.220 --> 16:14.480]  We need to stack. Get off me.
[16:16.640 --> 16:17.180]  Let's go.
[16:18.040 --> 16:18.640]  Get the key.
[16:19.420 --> 16:20.040]  We're dead.
[16:20.120 --> 16:21.120]  Get more time.
[16:22.120 --> 16:23.200]  Get out of the way.
[16:23.460 --> 16:26.020]  Run left, you purple idiot.
[16:26.220 --> 16:26.500]  Let's go.
[16:29.380 --> 16:30.260]  Five seconds.
[16:32.020 --> 16:32.280]  Yes.
[16:32.880 --> 16:33.120]  Get in.
[16:34.660 --> 16:35.540]  One second.
[16:37.660 --> 16:39.040]  Everyone just started going right.
[16:39.240 --> 16:41.420]  It's not that hard to think one step ahead,
[16:41.540 --> 16:42.900]  but boy is it tough in the moment.
[16:43.320 --> 16:44.900]  I was thinking another step ahead
[16:44.900 --> 16:46.860]  because I didn't want the key to bounce off of us.
[16:46.860 --> 16:47.860]  Oh.
[16:48.900 --> 16:49.680]  What the?
[16:51.320 --> 16:51.860]  Easy.
[16:52.800 --> 16:54.220]  Easy. Manageable.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.260]  Someone help me
[16:57.260 --> 16:58.420]  get on these.
[16:58.880 --> 17:00.360]  What color are you? Blue.
[17:00.700 --> 17:01.520]  Orange, jump up.
[17:02.440 --> 17:03.980]  Nothing? I can't make it.
[17:05.140 --> 17:05.960]  It's a triple.
[17:06.480 --> 17:07.720]  It's a triple stack.
[17:07.900 --> 17:09.260]  I'll go over there and help.
[17:10.080 --> 17:10.880]  Go to the next one.
[17:12.680 --> 17:13.520]  Triple stack.
[17:13.520 --> 17:15.060]  Go, go, go.
[17:15.600 --> 17:16.900]  The key. Grab it.
[17:17.240 --> 17:17.740]  Open the door.
[17:20.300 --> 17:21.020]  It's okay.
[17:21.160 --> 17:22.200]  We learned the triple stack.
[17:23.200 --> 17:24.280]  I'm going right.
[17:24.400 --> 17:25.560]  Let's triple stack first.
[17:26.260 --> 17:28.280]  We gotta get all these lower coins.
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.220]  And then we will...
[17:30.220 --> 17:33.420]  Geoff, you and I will triple stack here.
[17:33.880 --> 17:34.020]  Okay.
[17:34.400 --> 17:35.360]  Someone jump on this.
[17:36.540 --> 17:37.180]  Coming up.
[17:38.840 --> 17:40.020]  Andrew, it's up to you.
[17:40.840 --> 17:41.740]  That was my fault.
[17:41.980 --> 17:44.100]  That's alright. Let's go over there and help.
[17:44.820 --> 17:46.140]  I need one more on it.
[17:46.440 --> 17:46.760]  There we go.
[17:47.360 --> 17:47.980]  One more on?
[17:50.420 --> 17:51.220]  We lost.
[17:51.700 --> 17:52.420]  Go left.
[17:53.860 --> 17:55.880]  How do you get up to do that?
[17:57.240 --> 17:58.120]  Do it on the inside
[17:58.120 --> 17:58.980]  instead of the outside.
[17:59.360 --> 18:02.280]  Chat, can you please let us know who the biggest hindrance is?
[18:02.380 --> 18:03.000]  It's hard to tell.
[18:04.660 --> 18:06.540]  I think it varies from round to round.
[18:07.060 --> 18:07.320]  Right here.
[18:07.320 --> 18:07.680]  Okay.
[18:08.320 --> 18:09.660]  How do we do this?
[18:09.880 --> 18:11.820]  Green, go in a little bit more.
[18:12.260 --> 18:13.500]  Now we've created steps.
[18:15.620 --> 18:16.540]  Come there.
[18:17.780 --> 18:18.600]  I'm going for the key.
[18:21.200 --> 18:22.100]  Get out of the way!
[18:22.180 --> 18:22.980]  Get out of the way!
[18:26.280 --> 18:27.200]  Jesus Christ!
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.140]  Just three guys.
[18:29.220 --> 18:30.020]  One guy with the key.
[18:30.140 --> 18:30.960]  You know it switches.
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.360]  What are you doing?
[18:34.440 --> 18:36.080]  Red may be the biggest hindrance.
[18:36.140 --> 18:41.060]  Get out of here.
[18:41.220 --> 18:42.660]  Nick's running around.
[18:43.840 --> 18:44.900]  I agree with Nick.
[18:45.000 --> 18:45.620]  It's a problem.
[18:47.040 --> 18:48.740]  I think we're doing this the wrong way.
[18:49.920 --> 18:51.040]  I think everybody on one, right?
[18:51.900 --> 18:53.140]  Let's go to the right and see it.
[18:53.360 --> 18:54.200]  Yeah, let's go check it out.
[18:54.700 --> 18:55.280]  Let's just go.
[18:56.440 --> 18:57.200]  A journey.
[18:58.460 --> 19:02.000]  I think each one needs two people to jump up to the next one.
[19:02.000 --> 19:02.660]  Yeah.
[19:03.180 --> 19:05.680]  Just leave someone on each floor.
[19:06.280 --> 19:08.140]  Yeah, so I think we have to stack
[19:08.140 --> 19:10.080]  all the way at the very front.
[19:10.280 --> 19:10.480]  Yeah.
[19:11.840 --> 19:13.440]  Nobody goes in.
[19:14.060 --> 19:15.460]  Yeah, it's the stacking.
[19:16.160 --> 19:17.900]  Okay, we're going to get on purple here.
[19:17.960 --> 19:18.500]  Alright, go.
[19:22.920 --> 19:24.420]  No point did we stack.
[19:25.580 --> 19:26.620]  What are we doing?
[19:27.060 --> 19:30.020]  Why did purple keep moving?
[19:30.220 --> 19:31.180]  What are you talking about?
[19:31.180 --> 19:32.300]  Just keep going.
[19:32.500 --> 19:34.700]  We need one more up here.
[19:35.460 --> 19:36.200]  There you go.
[19:36.580 --> 19:38.180]  There you go.
[19:38.440 --> 19:40.120]  What are you talking about? I did it right.
[19:40.860 --> 19:42.240]  No, you kept moving.
[19:42.300 --> 19:43.300]  What are you talking about?
[19:44.340 --> 19:46.260]  Why would you be at the door?
[19:46.660 --> 19:48.120]  Why would you be at the door?
[19:48.500 --> 19:49.180]  There we go.
[19:50.640 --> 19:52.580]  I didn't move, you fucking losers.
[19:52.660 --> 19:53.420]  What are you talking about?
[19:56.140 --> 19:57.840]  Nick, do you see in the chat?
[19:58.020 --> 19:59.180]  Nick kept walking forward.
[20:02.560 --> 20:04.140]  I love this, Nick.
[20:04.340 --> 20:05.380]  That was the best.
[20:08.540 --> 20:09.660]  Fucking losers.
[20:14.480 --> 20:16.200]  What the fuck is this?
[20:16.420 --> 20:17.860]  Is that our first t-shirt?
[20:18.860 --> 20:20.300]  I got a hat.
[20:20.800 --> 20:22.060]  Is that a shield?
[20:22.060 --> 20:23.420]  We're going to die if we go in there, right?
[20:26.920 --> 20:28.680]  I should be on top.
[20:28.680 --> 20:29.060]  Yes.
[20:29.220 --> 20:30.020]  Make a big stack.
[20:30.420 --> 20:33.720]  This certainly isn't the way to do it.
[20:33.940 --> 20:34.700]  Green jump.
[20:35.740 --> 20:38.320]  Let me keep jumping here.
[20:40.260 --> 20:42.960]  If you're on me, I can't move.
[20:44.320 --> 20:46.540]  Gavin should not be the first one.
[20:48.240 --> 20:49.440]  Jesus Christ.
[20:49.800 --> 20:51.540]  It's not complicated.
[20:51.820 --> 20:53.060]  You're choosing to make it so.
[20:53.940 --> 20:54.460]  It's not hard.
[20:54.460 --> 20:55.140]  Red, lead.
[20:56.220 --> 20:57.560]  I'm trying to.
[20:57.780 --> 20:59.360]  You're doing a great job.
[20:59.960 --> 21:02.140]  I got no problem with you.
[21:02.520 --> 21:03.680]  Everybody thinks you're great.
[21:03.980 --> 21:04.760]  Shut up.
[21:06.440 --> 21:08.000]  Okay, now red.
[21:08.160 --> 21:08.700]  Now orange.
[21:09.780 --> 21:10.920]  Now purple.
[21:11.800 --> 21:12.400]  Hang on.
[21:12.580 --> 21:15.740]  Where do you fucking go?
[21:15.840 --> 21:16.700]  Line up.
[21:17.200 --> 21:18.660]  You line up, purple.
[21:19.260 --> 21:20.220]  Blue, go.
[21:20.220 --> 21:20.780]  I found it.
[21:22.380 --> 21:23.220]  You're fine.
[21:26.120 --> 21:27.120]  God damn.
[21:27.700 --> 21:29.700]  It is just really something.
[21:30.840 --> 21:32.140]  You got so close.
[21:32.660 --> 21:33.900]  Red's in the way, I can't go.
[21:34.340 --> 21:35.920]  I can't move. Green's in the way.
[21:36.180 --> 21:36.560]  There we go.
[21:36.920 --> 21:37.440]  I did it.
[21:39.840 --> 21:41.200]  I just like to apologize.
[21:42.400 --> 21:42.640]  Son!
[21:44.460 --> 21:45.960]  You fucking loser.
[21:46.540 --> 21:47.100]  I mean, yeah.
[21:48.060 --> 21:48.980]  Apology accepted.
[21:49.140 --> 21:50.360]  When you're wrong...
[21:50.360 --> 21:51.800]  I was absolutely right.
[21:51.820 --> 21:53.520]  You were absolutely not wrong.
[21:54.060 --> 21:55.720]  Oh, okay.
[21:56.040 --> 21:58.440]  This is really good.
[21:58.860 --> 21:59.600]  Wait, who's purple?
[21:59.900 --> 22:00.540]  That's weird.
[22:03.500 --> 22:05.100]  This is going to be fucking...
[22:06.020 --> 22:07.920]  So if you like this, check out Chain Together.
[22:08.880 --> 22:10.340]  I just committed suicide.
[22:10.720 --> 22:11.180]  That was me.
[22:11.980 --> 22:12.400]  That was my fault.
[22:13.380 --> 22:15.940]  You keep telling people to watch a video that's not out.
[22:15.940 --> 22:18.560]  I know, I'm really excited to see it.
[22:18.900 --> 22:20.540]  The chat totally disagrees with it.
[22:22.240 --> 22:23.800]  No, I mean, that's fine.
[22:24.060 --> 22:26.360]  I mean, if you want to listen to these comment leavers, you can.
[22:26.740 --> 22:28.360]  It's a race, I'm winning the race.
[22:28.820 --> 22:29.680]  Oh, shit!
[22:33.260 --> 22:34.540]  Red killed me.
[22:35.200 --> 22:36.960]  No, you killed me.
[22:37.400 --> 22:37.960]  What do you mean?
[22:38.320 --> 22:40.200]  You went into the wall.
[22:41.180 --> 22:42.200]  You can go back.
[22:42.480 --> 22:43.960]  You can go back, dummy.
[22:43.960 --> 22:45.660]  Go backwards to get the key.
[22:45.820 --> 22:46.300]  Just one.
[22:47.880 --> 22:49.060]  Okay, there you go.
[22:49.520 --> 22:51.280]  Forward, forward, forward.
[22:51.400 --> 22:52.180]  Gavin, the blue one.
[22:53.480 --> 22:54.940]  Give him space to come back up.
[22:56.440 --> 22:57.780]  Someone else got it, but that's fine.
[22:57.780 --> 22:59.120]  Do I have it? Do I have the key?
[22:59.400 --> 22:59.980]  I don't want the key.
[23:03.050 --> 23:03.690]  Ooh, door.
[23:05.350 --> 23:06.410]  Okay, blue has it.
[23:07.550 --> 23:09.170]  There we go. Easy. Simple.
[23:09.730 --> 23:11.090]  That's a fucking baby level.
[23:11.430 --> 23:12.150]  That's an easy one.
[23:12.150 --> 23:13.530]  Give me all of those.
[23:13.750 --> 23:15.150]  Give me ten more of those.
[23:15.610 --> 23:17.790]  You know what, Eric? I can tell.
[23:17.970 --> 23:19.410]  Andrew did that one for the boys.
[23:19.910 --> 23:21.190]  I mean, I just see...
[23:21.910 --> 23:24.230]  Hang on, you're telling me this one's for the fucking boys?
[23:24.450 --> 23:25.070]  What the?
[23:25.490 --> 23:26.470]  That's what Andrew said.
[23:27.470 --> 23:28.410]  Wait, hang on.
[23:30.670 --> 23:32.710]  It has to be less than two and a half seconds?
[23:34.530 --> 23:35.790]  Oh, I've already died then.
[23:36.970 --> 23:37.690]  Oh, you mean total?
[23:39.430 --> 23:40.590]  Oh, we gotta do it total.
[23:41.790 --> 23:42.190]  What?
[23:43.270 --> 23:44.950]  Geoff, stop hitting the button!
[23:45.250 --> 23:46.630]  So, I don't know what to do.
[23:46.810 --> 23:49.090]  You've given us eight seconds, and we need 2.5.
[23:49.310 --> 23:49.910]  Or 2.25.
[23:50.490 --> 23:52.750]  Okay, it needs to be real low. Less than a second.
[23:53.310 --> 23:54.890]  Geoff's gonna hit the button at like six.
[23:56.230 --> 23:57.630]  Geoff, when it's like...
[23:57.630 --> 23:59.430]  When it's almost about to count down to zero,
[23:59.530 --> 23:59.910]  hit the button.
[24:02.590 --> 24:02.990]  Oh!
[24:04.810 --> 24:05.610]  So close!
[24:06.890 --> 24:08.510]  I went up to the right side.
[24:08.510 --> 24:09.890]  That's my fault.
[24:10.870 --> 24:12.530]  I'm gonna practice getting a real look.
[24:14.870 --> 24:16.230]  I'll take the blame on that one.
[24:16.910 --> 24:18.870]  I'll take the blame on that one.
[24:21.950 --> 24:22.410]  Three...
[24:23.390 --> 24:23.850]  Two...
[24:25.570 --> 24:26.030]  One...
[24:26.030 --> 24:26.550]  Yeah!
[24:28.990 --> 24:30.490]  I like that one a lot.
[24:30.570 --> 24:31.350]  Yeah, that was great.
[24:31.690 --> 24:34.670]  Who's the biggest hindrance? Poll just ended.
[24:34.970 --> 24:36.170]  Who's the biggest hindrance?
[24:36.170 --> 24:38.050]  Andrew at 61%.
[24:38.050 --> 24:39.390]  I'm gonna win the vote.
[24:39.770 --> 24:41.390]  It's my brand to be the hindrance.
[24:41.990 --> 24:44.390]  Gavin, were you impressed by my 69?
[24:44.930 --> 24:46.130]  Oh, that was yours? That was incredible.
[24:46.290 --> 24:46.930]  I did that for you.
[24:47.110 --> 24:51.210]  Oh, God, it's hot in here.
[24:51.510 --> 24:52.550]  This is just like chained together.
[24:52.750 --> 24:54.670]  We've just been sweating for the last three days.
[24:56.670 --> 24:57.950]  I don't wanna be bigger!
[24:58.030 --> 24:59.030]  I wanna be small! Small!
[25:00.530 --> 25:01.510]  I'm so little.
[25:02.290 --> 25:03.330]  I'm a little cat.
[25:03.330 --> 25:05.110]  Oh, we might need some height.
[25:07.630 --> 25:09.250]  Somebody didn't get small enough.
[25:09.510 --> 25:10.890]  Purple, you need to get small.
[25:11.150 --> 25:12.810]  Oh, who's the biggest hindrance now?
[25:13.230 --> 25:14.430]  Let's run that poll back.
[25:14.890 --> 25:15.410]  I mean, I agree.
[25:17.510 --> 25:19.070]  Nick made me too big.
[25:19.290 --> 25:21.590]  In the whole thing, Nick made me too...
[25:21.590 --> 25:23.950]  You guys saw that? Nick made me too big.
[25:24.270 --> 25:26.330]  Once in the chat when Nick made me too big.
[25:26.430 --> 25:27.410]  I made you big?
[25:27.770 --> 25:27.990]  What?
[25:28.470 --> 25:31.690]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:31.690 --> 25:33.590]  We need a couple big ones.
[25:33.590 --> 25:34.570]  We need a couple big ones.
[25:35.850 --> 25:36.650]  Let's get...
[25:37.130 --> 25:37.910]  That's too big.
[25:38.190 --> 25:40.470]  Why don't you grow while I'm on your head?
[25:42.010 --> 25:43.750]  That's an interesting sentence.
[25:43.890 --> 25:44.970]  You just need one person
[25:44.970 --> 25:47.210]  between me and smaller than me
[25:47.210 --> 25:48.510]  and then you guys can jump over your head.
[25:49.430 --> 25:49.910]  There you go.
[25:50.070 --> 25:50.390]  That's too big.
[25:54.550 --> 25:56.090]  He's not understanding
[25:56.090 --> 25:56.910]  what the need is.
[25:56.990 --> 25:57.670]  It's so funny.
[25:57.670 --> 25:59.630]  Just have two people stacked
[25:59.630 --> 26:01.010]  and then one of them grow.
[26:02.670 --> 26:03.270]  Purple.
[26:03.750 --> 26:05.190]  Ready? Nick, ready?
[26:05.650 --> 26:06.970]  Just get on. Jump.
[26:07.350 --> 26:08.010]  Jump on me.
[26:08.170 --> 26:08.650]  Jump.
[26:10.830 --> 26:12.430]  Oh, I see.
[26:13.290 --> 26:14.170]  There you go.
[26:14.590 --> 26:15.810]  There you go.
[26:16.930 --> 26:18.090]  We need more of us.
[26:18.630 --> 26:20.950]  Four people in there, so three littles.
[26:21.530 --> 26:22.870]  I want to be small.
[26:23.590 --> 26:24.590]  How are you so big?
[26:25.570 --> 26:26.450]  Three littles.
[26:27.010 --> 26:28.690]  How the hell are we going to get up there?
[26:31.590 --> 26:33.190]  Geoff, you need to get small.
[26:33.750 --> 26:35.190]  Geoff, you need to get small
[26:35.190 --> 26:36.390]  and jump on Gavin.
[26:36.710 --> 26:37.670]  I'm small.
[26:38.090 --> 26:38.810]  He's small.
[26:40.990 --> 26:41.890]  That's what's happening.
[26:42.130 --> 26:43.910]  Hey, Andrew, you need to get small.
[26:44.090 --> 26:46.130]  I'm sorry. I thought red was Geoff.
[26:46.250 --> 26:46.770]  That's my bad.
[26:47.890 --> 26:49.250]  Why didn't you get small, Andrew?
[26:49.690 --> 26:50.550]  Everybody on me.
[26:50.550 --> 26:51.270]  Everybody on me.
[26:51.370 --> 26:54.170]  This was what the plan was.
[26:55.390 --> 26:57.530]  I was too busy getting Nick up there.
[26:57.530 --> 26:59.430]  I was too busy getting Nick up there.
[26:59.730 --> 27:00.950]  Doing the work.
[27:01.830 --> 27:02.350]  Yeah, anyway.
[27:02.490 --> 27:02.850]  There we go.
[27:04.090 --> 27:06.490]  And then, how do we get...
[27:06.490 --> 27:07.970]  Before you push it.
[27:09.850 --> 27:10.290]  Push.
[27:10.510 --> 27:11.390]  Gotta keep pushing.
[27:12.910 --> 27:15.270]  You need to get small enough to get in the door, I think.
[27:15.530 --> 27:16.370]  I'm gonna fit in.
[27:16.590 --> 27:18.250]  Don't worry. I got it. I'm in.
[27:18.250 --> 27:19.290]  I'm good at fitting.
[27:20.770 --> 27:21.570]  Told you.
[27:23.630 --> 27:24.270]  I keep thinking
[27:24.270 --> 27:26.290]  red is Geoff, and I don't know why I default
[27:26.290 --> 27:27.590]  to that. I apologize, Geoff.
[27:27.910 --> 27:28.850]  No worries, man.
[27:30.350 --> 27:31.930]  I kind of have a...
[27:32.350 --> 27:34.630]  I kind of have an orange
[27:34.630 --> 27:36.390]  thing going with me
[27:36.390 --> 27:37.570]  for the last two decades.
[27:38.370 --> 27:39.890]  I tend to gravitate towards that.
[27:40.850 --> 27:42.230]  I get it. I didn't watch any of your stuff.
[27:42.250 --> 27:43.170]  Definitely not yellow.
[27:44.090 --> 27:44.890]  Definitely orange.
[27:44.890 --> 27:46.470]  Somebody snuck into our test game.
[27:46.670 --> 27:47.890]  I think blue's gotta push it, yeah?
[27:48.050 --> 27:48.950]  How'd you figure that out?
[27:49.570 --> 27:52.330]  I'm just trying to crack the code. I'm seeing if I can do it.
[27:56.770 --> 27:57.130]  Alright.
[28:01.170 --> 28:01.730]  Hey, guys.
[28:01.910 --> 28:02.290]  It's me.
[28:04.110 --> 28:04.710]  Hey, purple.
[28:04.830 --> 28:06.350]  I need...
[28:06.790 --> 28:08.950]  That's definitely the wrong way, right?
[28:09.390 --> 28:10.650]  For orange to push that?
[28:11.090 --> 28:13.170]  I think blue needs to wait back there for a minute.
[28:14.490 --> 28:14.870]  Back there?
[28:15.290 --> 28:15.910]  Is that what it is?
[28:16.350 --> 28:17.930]  Yeah, go ahead and hop back down real quick.
[28:18.430 --> 28:19.830]  I'll bet you were supposed to push that
[28:19.830 --> 28:21.170]  orange block to the left.
[28:22.030 --> 28:22.610]  You think so?
[28:23.270 --> 28:24.130]  That's what I was saying.
[28:26.610 --> 28:27.970]  I thought we were going left.
[28:28.330 --> 28:29.150]  You said left.
[28:29.730 --> 28:31.570]  So you heard the word left and you went,
[28:31.750 --> 28:33.050]  surely that's all he said.
[28:33.610 --> 28:35.870]  I was looking left to see where I'm supposed to push it to.
[28:36.570 --> 28:38.030]  Down to where the blue thing is
[28:38.030 --> 28:39.510]  so that way people can jump on it.
[28:39.790 --> 28:40.870]  I think that's what's supposed to happen.
[28:41.870 --> 28:43.490]  Can we restart to get everyone up?
[28:43.490 --> 28:45.970]  Yeah, because I don't think we can get...
[28:45.970 --> 28:47.850]  I don't think we can go past this here.
[28:48.110 --> 28:48.770]  Should we restart?
[28:49.390 --> 28:50.090]  Yeah, I think we should.
[28:50.890 --> 28:51.830]  We got it now.
[28:53.290 --> 28:54.370]  Easy baby shit.
[28:54.830 --> 28:57.610]  Also, Gavin, when you push it, don't push it all the way
[28:57.610 --> 28:59.910]  to the edge because I think we need the orange
[28:59.910 --> 29:01.730]  to go a little further.
[29:01.790 --> 29:02.270]  A little bit more.
[29:03.510 --> 29:04.810]  Orange, why don't you jump on me?
[29:05.710 --> 29:07.710]  Just a hair more. There you go.
[29:07.770 --> 29:09.510]  Go ahead and jump up.
[29:10.130 --> 29:11.510]  And then push it left.
[29:11.510 --> 29:13.410]  Wait, hang on, because it needs to stack
[29:13.410 --> 29:14.750]  on the blue. It'll stack there, right?
[29:15.270 --> 29:15.690]  It will there.
[29:16.030 --> 29:18.050]  Then we can get up.
[29:18.490 --> 29:20.150]  I think it would stack either way because it's smaller.
[29:21.090 --> 29:23.130]  But we have to be able to jump on it.
[29:25.030 --> 29:27.730]  Do we want to just go right to see where we're going?
[29:27.850 --> 29:29.690]  Yeah, let's see where we're looking at.
[29:30.450 --> 29:31.330]  We have to land on the red.
[29:31.950 --> 29:33.450]  Right, but I assume so
[29:33.450 --> 29:35.430]  but let's just go all the way right so we can see
[29:35.430 --> 29:37.330]  what exactly we need to feel this.
[29:38.190 --> 29:39.290]  Purple on the red.
[29:40.190 --> 29:41.410]  But what about the green?
[29:43.050 --> 29:44.170]  So we need the key.
[29:44.610 --> 29:46.150]  You guys want to keep moving this way or no?
[29:49.950 --> 29:50.990]  And then the door is
[29:50.990 --> 29:51.950]  probably just right over here.
[29:52.210 --> 29:54.450]  Oh, it's way up there.
[29:54.450 --> 29:57.030]  So we need to get the key first and then we can push that
[29:57.030 --> 29:57.450]  shit off.
[29:58.730 --> 30:01.110]  So I think we have to stack the boxes
[30:01.110 --> 30:01.910]  the entire way.
[30:02.930 --> 30:04.350]  Okay, so we stack.
[30:05.490 --> 30:07.150]  So put purple on red
[30:07.150 --> 30:09.470]  and then I'll put green on purple.
[30:10.170 --> 30:10.490]  Right?
[30:11.110 --> 30:12.710]  Why doesn't orange get up there just in case?
[30:14.010 --> 30:15.430]  Here, let's take a look. What's up there again?
[30:17.270 --> 30:18.710]  Green is all the way at the very top.
[30:18.930 --> 30:19.830]  How do I get up there?
[30:21.670 --> 30:22.550]  Jump on purple.
[30:23.750 --> 30:24.650]  Yeah, there you go. Now jump.
[30:25.650 --> 30:27.190]  If you can't make that jump, we can... there you go.
[30:27.670 --> 30:28.170]  Okay, so.
[30:28.170 --> 30:30.030]  Now let's just push to the inward hole.
[30:30.190 --> 30:30.790]  Let's take a look.
[30:33.130 --> 30:34.350]  I'm sorry. Oh, I see.
[30:34.410 --> 30:36.250]  We're just seeing what other colors we need.
[30:36.250 --> 30:37.530]  Do we want to...
[30:38.510 --> 30:39.070]  Nice.
[30:40.030 --> 30:40.250]  Alright.
[30:40.710 --> 30:43.230]  So it needs to end with...
[30:43.230 --> 30:45.410]  I think what needs to happen...
[30:45.410 --> 30:48.210]  We put purple on red.
[30:48.490 --> 30:50.570]  Then I put green on purple.
[30:50.850 --> 30:52.330]  Then I jump
[30:52.330 --> 30:54.210]  on top of green to where you three
[30:54.210 --> 30:56.330]  are there. And then I move
[30:56.330 --> 30:58.150]  all the way to the right to the last green.
[30:58.610 --> 31:00.710]  We put blue on green.
[31:01.210 --> 31:02.050]  Orange on blue.
[31:02.270 --> 31:03.870]  And then I'll put green on blue.
[31:03.870 --> 31:04.790]  And I think that's how we get up.
[31:05.970 --> 31:07.390]  I put orange first.
[31:07.490 --> 31:09.870]  I think it goes red, purple, green,
[31:09.970 --> 31:11.010]  orange, blue, green.
[31:12.350 --> 31:13.770]  Because that orange is whiter.
[31:14.190 --> 31:15.630]  Alright, can you move
[31:15.630 --> 31:16.950]  red a little bit more to the right?
[31:17.010 --> 31:18.570]  It just needs to angle, right?
[31:19.770 --> 31:21.770]  It can't be stacked straight up and down.
[31:22.390 --> 31:23.030]  Oh, actually,
[31:23.710 --> 31:25.770]  because of the size difference, it can.
[31:25.990 --> 31:27.850]  Because they're all going to hit the wall and we'll be able
[31:27.850 --> 31:28.390]  to go up.
[31:29.630 --> 31:31.130]  We don't have to be precise.
[31:31.130 --> 31:32.730]  It's the same as the first.
[31:32.810 --> 31:33.970]  Okay, purple, get out of the way.
[31:36.210 --> 31:37.170]  Okay, now...
[31:37.170 --> 31:38.130]  Here's a problem.
[31:39.130 --> 31:41.270]  Now it should be orange, then blue.
[31:41.630 --> 31:42.690]  Oh, look who's the
[31:43.250 --> 31:43.730]  problem.
[31:45.470 --> 31:45.910]  Hey, red?
[31:46.990 --> 31:49.210]  It doesn't matter. I'm stuck on this side now.
[31:51.770 --> 31:52.830]  You're fucking right.
[31:53.630 --> 31:53.830]  Wait.
[31:54.750 --> 31:55.950]  No, you're not.
[31:56.650 --> 31:58.790]  You're just going to climb up the...
[31:58.790 --> 31:59.050]  Where?
[31:59.050 --> 32:00.710]  He won't be able to.
[32:01.270 --> 32:02.950]  He's stuck on this side now.
[32:03.310 --> 32:04.250]  Can you push?
[32:05.110 --> 32:06.390]  Keep pushing purple.
[32:07.390 --> 32:08.750]  There you go. Now hang on.
[32:09.470 --> 32:10.450]  Stop, stop, stop.
[32:10.630 --> 32:11.230]  I am stopping.
[32:12.930 --> 32:13.270]  Oh, sweet.
[32:14.130 --> 32:17.810]  Alright, Nick's free.
[32:18.810 --> 32:19.930]  Let's fix it now.
[32:20.150 --> 32:22.470]  Now push purple back some.
[32:22.730 --> 32:24.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:25.470 --> 32:27.230]  Sorry, I was trying to get over you.
[32:27.230 --> 32:27.630]  I know.
[32:30.870 --> 32:31.590]  Andrew, push.
[32:31.670 --> 32:32.810]  A little more, a little more.
[32:32.890 --> 32:35.050]  There we go, okay. So now...
[32:35.050 --> 32:36.950]  Fuck, no, because now orange won't go.
[32:37.850 --> 32:38.910]  What do you mean orange won't go?
[32:39.570 --> 32:40.750]  Come push, come on, push yourself.
[32:40.750 --> 32:42.770]  Just put green back over and then jump over the back.
[32:43.310 --> 32:44.110]  No, no.
[32:45.030 --> 32:46.750]  Not that way, the other way.
[32:48.890 --> 32:49.590]  And then what?
[32:49.890 --> 32:50.970]  We have to climb from this side.
[32:50.990 --> 32:53.030]  Ram it into the wall and straighten it out.
[32:53.210 --> 32:53.990]  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
[32:53.990 --> 32:55.110]  How do you get it back?
[32:56.930 --> 32:57.810]  Don't do that.
[32:59.710 --> 33:00.510]  Alright, so...
[33:01.190 --> 33:01.590]  So...
[33:01.590 --> 33:02.650]  Slow down.
[33:04.250 --> 33:05.830]  Andrew, you're gonna jump...
[33:05.830 --> 33:06.950]  Nick, get on top of me.
[33:07.950 --> 33:10.210]  You're gonna jump on that all the way over.
[33:10.490 --> 33:11.570]  You're gonna move red back.
[33:12.850 --> 33:14.490]  This is a solvable thing.
[33:14.910 --> 33:16.350]  Go way back, go further back.
[33:16.390 --> 33:17.750]  Go back in between the two.
[33:18.050 --> 33:18.890]  Oh, you know what?
[33:20.290 --> 33:21.190]  How does he get up now?
[33:22.450 --> 33:23.930]  Go further back.
[33:24.710 --> 33:28.090]  Go further back where you guys have easier ability to jump.
[33:30.190 --> 33:31.890]  I can restart at any point.
[33:32.050 --> 33:33.470]  Yeah, but we don't have to.
[33:33.710 --> 33:34.430]  We don't need to.
[33:34.610 --> 33:36.870]  But how's Andrew gonna get around?
[33:38.830 --> 33:39.750]  We're gonna figure it out.
[33:39.830 --> 33:40.490]  We're gonna figure it out.
[33:40.850 --> 33:42.170]  So now we...
[33:42.170 --> 33:44.630]  I think where he pushed it just boned us.
[33:44.970 --> 33:45.830]  I think you're right.
[33:47.490 --> 33:49.490]  No, it didn't bonus.
[33:49.490 --> 33:50.710]  Guys, don't be dumb.
[33:50.810 --> 33:52.550]  Purple fall. Fall to the right.
[33:52.990 --> 33:54.810]  Reverse stack Andrew back out.
[33:55.430 --> 33:57.970]  And then he can go to the other side and push it back forward.
[33:58.030 --> 33:58.590]  Go left.
[33:59.110 --> 34:00.150]  Andrew, up and over.
[34:00.810 --> 34:02.070]  How does the last person get out?
[34:03.610 --> 34:04.610]  We're gonna make it work.
[34:04.730 --> 34:06.410]  He pushes this over a little bit.
[34:07.010 --> 34:08.690]  I'll push that to match.
[34:11.170 --> 34:12.590]  Now push it more, Andrew.
[34:12.990 --> 34:13.810]  Push a little more, Andrew.
[34:14.770 --> 34:15.430]  There you go.
[34:16.110 --> 34:16.790]  There you go.
[34:16.870 --> 34:19.090]  And now I'm gonna slide it back.
[34:20.770 --> 34:23.890]  I really don't think the sliding isn't crucial.
[34:24.510 --> 34:25.570]  They're all different sizes.
[34:25.770 --> 34:27.550]  When it hits the wall, I think we can even it out.
[34:27.550 --> 34:29.770]  I think green just needs to get up there now.
[34:29.870 --> 34:31.130]  I totally agree with you.
[34:31.590 --> 34:32.530]  Totally agree with you.
[34:32.730 --> 34:34.310]  Now we just need to get green close.
[34:37.270 --> 34:39.810]  Green needs to go up before it loses.
[34:40.230 --> 34:42.710]  Geoff, I need you to jump up here so I can jump on you.
[34:42.950 --> 34:43.210]  Okay.
[34:46.370 --> 34:47.090]  Like here?
[34:47.430 --> 34:48.330]  Yeah, that's fine.
[34:49.630 --> 34:50.110]  Go.
[34:51.450 --> 34:51.930]  Orange.
[34:53.130 --> 34:54.670]  Andrew, you keep it where it's at.
[34:55.230 --> 34:55.610]  Orange.
[34:57.270 --> 34:57.870]  Keep going.
[34:59.350 --> 35:00.310]  Hang on.
[35:00.390 --> 35:00.950]  Go left.
[35:02.170 --> 35:02.650]  Blue.
[35:04.790 --> 35:05.950]  Andrew, go ahead and push it.
[35:10.070 --> 35:11.030]  Hang on.
[35:12.070 --> 35:13.610]  You're trying to make it too far.
[35:13.610 --> 35:14.010]  That's good.
[35:15.570 --> 35:16.510]  Now let's go.
[35:17.450 --> 35:23.170]  So, when it gets all the way to this wall...
[35:23.170 --> 35:24.490]  How are you gonna move...
[35:24.490 --> 35:25.430]  Shut up.
[35:26.530 --> 35:27.850]  Move it all the way to the wall.
[35:28.230 --> 35:28.850]  Yeah, we got it.
[35:29.110 --> 35:30.590]  Nick, start jumping and pushing.
[35:31.670 --> 35:33.710]  Then Eric starts jumping and pushing.
[35:34.910 --> 35:36.370]  Then Geoff will come up.
[35:36.390 --> 35:37.110]  I think we might be good.
[35:38.030 --> 35:38.530]  We did it.
[35:39.570 --> 35:39.970]  Nice.
[35:39.970 --> 35:41.230]  This is what I was saying.
[35:41.350 --> 35:43.370]  They're all different sizes and we can get them in.
[35:43.670 --> 35:46.430]  They were all different sizes the first time we did it.
[35:47.630 --> 35:48.070]  That's true.
[35:48.830 --> 35:50.230]  We did it.
[35:50.970 --> 35:52.310]  Yeah, we're good.
[35:53.350 --> 35:54.350]  Everybody's right.
[35:54.870 --> 35:56.950]  Everybody's confidently, angrily right.
[35:57.250 --> 35:58.910]  That was the first one.
[35:59.470 --> 35:59.710]  No.
[36:01.130 --> 36:01.930]  Is this level moving?
[36:02.310 --> 36:02.910]  God.
[36:04.150 --> 36:06.270]  I'm getting texts from fucking
[36:06.270 --> 36:08.210]  Vanessa and Batdog and
[36:08.210 --> 36:10.270]  Emily saying, oh, we're all gonna play this now.
[36:10.430 --> 36:10.690]  No.
[36:11.930 --> 36:14.390]  Nick, that wasn't on you.
[36:15.370 --> 36:15.670]  I'm dead.
[36:16.050 --> 36:17.290]  You fucking killed me.
[36:17.530 --> 36:19.110]  We need to stack.
[36:19.390 --> 36:21.670]  I want to play with Batdog and Vanessa.
[36:27.630 --> 36:28.790]  There's nowhere for me to go.
[36:28.850 --> 36:29.070]  I'm sorry.
[36:30.550 --> 36:30.990]  Nope.
[36:31.910 --> 36:32.970]  Nick, it's not your fault.
[36:33.210 --> 36:33.970]  I know.
[36:37.310 --> 36:38.790]  We need to...
[36:38.790 --> 36:40.010]  You killed everyone.
[36:40.790 --> 36:41.430]  Alright.
[36:42.150 --> 36:43.830]  I'm gonna leave space.
[36:43.970 --> 36:45.350]  That was Eric's fault.
[36:46.550 --> 36:47.870]  What are you talking about?
[36:48.190 --> 36:49.790]  You ran off before everyone was off.
[36:50.110 --> 36:52.670]  Blue, go up.
[36:53.770 --> 36:55.750]  Gavin, why did you kill us?
[36:56.650 --> 36:57.050]  Hey, Gavin.
[36:57.550 --> 36:57.730]  Yeah.
[36:58.290 --> 36:59.530]  Any thoughts on that one?
[37:00.170 --> 37:00.790]  I'm alive.
[37:03.730 --> 37:04.370]  Alright.
[37:04.810 --> 37:05.750]  I'm the base.
[37:05.750 --> 37:06.590]  You got it.
[37:07.090 --> 37:08.950]  Get up.
[37:09.090 --> 37:09.730]  Climb up.
[37:15.130 --> 37:16.190]  I'm gonna run.
[37:17.010 --> 37:17.530]  Perfect.
[37:18.110 --> 37:19.030]  Get off me.
[37:19.850 --> 37:21.690]  Why did red move?
[37:22.790 --> 37:24.430]  Andrew, why did you...
[37:24.430 --> 37:26.210]  Why are we doing stairs?
[37:27.170 --> 37:27.850]  It's time to go.
[37:28.010 --> 37:29.050]  We're at the top.
[37:30.470 --> 37:32.570]  Alright, we just walk off it.
[37:33.130 --> 37:34.410]  Don't do it yet.
[37:34.650 --> 37:35.250]  Wait.
[37:35.250 --> 37:35.850]  Stop.
[37:36.690 --> 37:38.650]  I don't know why this head's involved.
[37:39.150 --> 37:39.850]  So, Gavin.
[37:40.450 --> 37:41.670]  We just walk off it.
[37:42.730 --> 37:45.230]  You're saying there's not enough time for the person at the back to jump?
[37:46.010 --> 37:46.350]  Correct.
[37:47.030 --> 37:48.630]  You just found that out, didn't you?
[37:50.730 --> 37:52.650]  If we're all wedged here, right?
[37:54.030 --> 37:55.730]  But the bottom people have to go.
[37:55.970 --> 37:57.610]  Don't let the top people go.
[37:57.830 --> 38:00.110]  There's plenty of time just to step off the thing.
[38:00.510 --> 38:01.210]  We just did it.
[38:01.550 --> 38:01.750]  Okay.
[38:01.750 --> 38:02.950]  You know what?
[38:03.270 --> 38:04.490]  I take it back.
[38:05.430 --> 38:08.190]  I don't. I feel like our plan made a lot of sense.
[38:08.510 --> 38:09.170]  Oh, no.
[38:09.690 --> 38:10.730]  Oh, no. Blue!
[38:11.250 --> 38:11.970]  Let's do it.
[38:13.730 --> 38:14.830]  Where are we supposed to go?
[38:15.110 --> 38:15.950]  Orange, can you get that?
[38:16.470 --> 38:18.070]  I can't.
[38:20.470 --> 38:21.890]  What are we supposed to...
[38:21.890 --> 38:22.590]  Oh, god, no.
[38:23.430 --> 38:25.670]  We have to stop sooner.
[38:26.190 --> 38:26.970]  And then it's easy.
[38:29.110 --> 38:29.430]  Okay.
[38:29.430 --> 38:30.130]  Easy.
[38:31.270 --> 38:32.310]  We have to stop.
[38:33.070 --> 38:34.330]  All we have to do is stop.
[38:35.210 --> 38:36.730]  You know what we can do?
[38:36.910 --> 38:39.530]  We can let the level catch up a little bit more
[38:39.530 --> 38:40.770]  and see where we're going.
[38:41.890 --> 38:42.330]  Okay.
[38:43.450 --> 38:44.810]  We got this down.
[38:46.270 --> 38:46.890]  It's easy.
[38:47.030 --> 38:48.410]  As soon as it lines up, just hold right.
[38:50.410 --> 38:52.230]  Why is the green going?
[38:52.970 --> 38:53.670]  Just hold right.
[38:53.670 --> 38:54.950]  What are you doing, green?
[38:56.730 --> 38:58.130]  I'm riding on purple
[38:58.130 --> 38:59.890]  and I was ready for purple to walk me off.
[39:00.250 --> 39:02.550]  You cannot walk from the platform.
[39:03.050 --> 39:05.670]  Everyone, just jump when you get to the top.
[39:05.670 --> 39:06.430]  I'm doing it!
[39:06.530 --> 39:09.350]  I did jump. There was a person on my noggin.
[39:09.970 --> 39:10.530]  Now go, go, go!
[39:10.570 --> 39:11.450]  Everyone, everyone, everyone!
[39:12.350 --> 39:12.750]  Jeez.
[39:19.340 --> 39:20.960]  You forgot which platform.
[39:21.260 --> 39:24.380]  I can't believe I am in a situation
[39:24.380 --> 39:26.520]  where I'm not the worst platformer.
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.040]  There was some slow bastard
[39:30.040 --> 39:31.180]  who never goes.
[39:31.280 --> 39:32.100]  It gets to the top
[39:32.100 --> 39:34.160]  and nobody goes.
[39:34.240 --> 39:35.420]  It didn't get to the top.
[39:35.560 --> 39:36.940]  You have to jump.
[39:37.640 --> 39:38.880]  You can't walk off.
[39:39.320 --> 39:40.880]  How high does this thing even go?
[39:41.760 --> 39:43.620]  It becomes level with it.
[39:44.040 --> 39:45.360]  There, we did it.
[39:45.440 --> 39:46.340]  Don't hesitate, go.
[39:48.700 --> 39:49.240]  So...
[39:50.260 --> 39:51.580]  What does that mean?
[39:52.360 --> 39:53.780]  We should wait a little bit longer
[39:53.780 --> 39:55.120]  so we can see in front of us, I guess,
[39:55.200 --> 39:56.300]  so that way people aren't scared.
[40:01.300 --> 40:01.740]  Well...
[40:01.740 --> 40:02.760]  Appreciate it, Matt.
[40:03.600 --> 40:04.480]  Good work.
[40:05.100 --> 40:06.280]  Thanks for coming back down.
[40:14.140 --> 40:18.060]  I should have pooed before this.
[40:19.280 --> 40:21.400]  The stacking is just such a problem.
[40:21.400 --> 40:22.860]  It's the thing that kills us.
[40:22.920 --> 40:23.640]  We made it, though.
[40:25.240 --> 40:27.580]  What is with the order changing once we get up?
[40:28.040 --> 40:29.660]  I just like being in the back.
[40:29.780 --> 40:30.280]  It's easier.
[40:30.380 --> 40:32.520]  I don't have to worry about any of you idiots doing something crazy.
[40:32.900 --> 40:33.860]  Blue at the bottom.
[40:34.400 --> 40:34.800]  Stop!
[40:36.160 --> 40:37.500]  Let everything catch up.
[40:38.880 --> 40:39.940]  Stop moving, blue.
[40:42.080 --> 40:43.020]  You're doing good.
[40:44.480 --> 40:45.220]  Go, purple.
[40:45.340 --> 40:45.840]  Fucking go.
[40:47.840 --> 40:49.040]  We don't want to go too much
[40:49.040 --> 40:50.260]  because it would have pushed the orange over.
[40:51.320 --> 40:53.020]  Go, green. Fucking go.
[40:53.460 --> 40:54.480]  There's nothing to jump to.
[40:54.500 --> 40:55.700]  I got purple in my fucking way.
[40:55.860 --> 40:57.920]  I can't fucking push it.
[40:59.380 --> 41:00.840]  We're fucked. We're gonna die.
[41:01.780 --> 41:03.580]  See, that's why I shouldn't push it too far
[41:03.580 --> 41:05.060]  because then the platform gets blown.
[41:05.240 --> 41:06.400]  You don't have to push. I need you to go to the top.
[41:06.860 --> 41:08.260]  You don't have to push shit.
[41:08.620 --> 41:09.700]  Then I'll go to the top.
[41:10.220 --> 41:12.060]  All you have to do is go to the top.
[41:12.420 --> 41:14.000]  You just go to where the top is.
[41:14.360 --> 41:15.300]  You shit pushers.
[41:16.660 --> 41:17.660]  All right, go.
[41:18.840 --> 41:19.500]  Jump.
[41:20.260 --> 41:20.640]  Jump.
[41:23.980 --> 41:24.760]  All right.
[41:30.450 --> 41:31.110]  Who?
[41:31.750 --> 41:32.870]  Why is anyone
[41:33.490 --> 41:35.070]  pushing anything but blue?
[41:35.390 --> 41:37.160]  Blue should be the only one pushing anything.
[41:38.450 --> 41:39.050]  We're okay.
[41:40.110 --> 41:40.850]  We're okay.
[41:41.370 --> 41:42.390]  Stop. There you go.
[41:43.130 --> 41:43.730]  Stop climbing.
[41:45.350 --> 41:47.230]  Start your climb, fellas.
[41:49.470 --> 41:50.590]  There we go.
[41:52.810 --> 41:53.890]  Red has the key.
[41:54.790 --> 41:56.370]  Get me out of this fucking room.
[41:58.410 --> 41:58.930]  Done.
[42:00.390 --> 42:01.290]  Oh my god.
[42:01.470 --> 42:03.230]  I don't know why anyone was pushing anything.
[42:04.950 --> 42:06.470]  Triple BT in the chat.
[42:07.030 --> 42:08.050]  They're right. Let's go.
[42:08.630 --> 42:09.790]  Wagsy, first try.
[42:12.910 --> 42:14.630]  This could be eight players.
[42:15.530 --> 42:17.150]  I think it's supposed to be, yeah.
[42:17.150 --> 42:17.770]  Oops.
[42:19.830 --> 42:20.830]  Don't do anything.
[42:21.230 --> 42:22.290]  Why are you doing anything?
[42:23.930 --> 42:25.450]  Don't you start having opinions.
[42:27.850 --> 42:28.970]  What are you doing?
[42:29.050 --> 42:29.790]  Why are you doing anything?
[42:30.110 --> 42:30.530]  Stand still.
[42:32.310 --> 42:34.650]  It just became unnecessarily complicated.
[42:34.810 --> 42:35.510]  We're all in a line.
[42:36.410 --> 42:38.510]  I agree. I'm with you.
[42:38.570 --> 42:39.910]  We need to see how high it goes
[42:39.910 --> 42:41.690]  before we go and figure it out.
[42:41.890 --> 42:44.110]  And now, we go.
[42:44.110 --> 42:44.870]  Alright.
[42:46.010 --> 42:47.110]  We did it.
[42:49.900 --> 42:51.330]  Geoff wants that.
[42:51.510 --> 42:53.450]  He can't get enough of it.
[42:53.730 --> 42:55.490]  He cannot get enough of it.
[42:57.870 --> 43:00.070]  Well, we gotta...
[43:00.070 --> 43:01.850]  Wait, if you die, where do you come back?
[43:03.990 --> 43:04.650]  Here.
[43:04.950 --> 43:07.650]  Die that way and then come...
[43:07.650 --> 43:08.390]  What?
[43:09.070 --> 43:09.490]  Yep.
[43:15.970 --> 43:16.690]  Oh.
[43:16.690 --> 43:17.610]  We're passing the key.
[43:18.250 --> 43:18.610]  Go.
[43:19.750 --> 43:20.910]  Great job.
[43:23.490 --> 43:25.710]  I wanna be up here.
[43:26.070 --> 43:26.730]  Geoff loves it.
[43:27.550 --> 43:29.370]  Ready? Go.
[43:30.890 --> 43:31.410]  Wow.
[43:32.170 --> 43:33.090]  Look at that.
[43:33.710 --> 43:34.470]  Get out of the way.
[43:35.650 --> 43:37.590]  Oh, Andrew Smith.
[43:38.190 --> 43:39.370]  Work together as a team.
[43:39.370 --> 43:41.630]  That was easy.
[43:42.070 --> 43:42.870]  That was the easiest one.
[43:46.370 --> 43:49.430]  This is a baby game.
[43:49.990 --> 43:50.710]  Don't push!
[44:01.180 --> 44:02.260]  Come on!
[44:02.460 --> 44:03.380]  I was in the air!
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.200]  You can't push a button in the air.
[44:08.640 --> 44:09.540]  Don't push.
[44:12.660 --> 44:13.040]  Alright.
[44:14.160 --> 44:15.180]  Oh, okay.
[44:16.180 --> 44:17.480]  So you have to jump a little earlier.
[44:20.720 --> 44:21.240]  Admittedly...
[44:21.240 --> 44:21.660]  Uh-huh.
[44:21.920 --> 44:23.360]  The physics are interesting.
[44:26.820 --> 44:29.000]  I think Geoff just ran through it.
[44:29.420 --> 44:30.380]  No, I jumped.
[44:30.700 --> 44:31.420]  I jumped.
[44:31.680 --> 44:33.280]  It's a timing thing for sure.
[44:34.940 --> 44:35.120]  Yeah.
[44:35.700 --> 44:37.760]  On my screen, I cleared it.
[44:38.260 --> 44:39.020]  Gavin, any thoughts?
[44:40.020 --> 44:41.980]  I have no thoughts.
[44:46.140 --> 44:47.000]  Alright, green.
[44:49.060 --> 44:50.700]  This is the furthest we've been.
[44:52.020 --> 44:53.280]  For some reason.
[44:57.020 --> 44:57.920]  Oh, God.
[44:59.940 --> 45:01.000]  My God.
[45:01.320 --> 45:01.620]  Eric.
[45:02.080 --> 45:04.120]  I'll go with Andrew on that one.
[45:04.200 --> 45:05.800]  I definitely cleared it on my screen.
[45:05.980 --> 45:06.720]  And then it pulled me back.
[45:07.460 --> 45:08.000]  100%.
[45:08.680 --> 45:09.660]  Pulled you back?
[45:10.620 --> 45:12.380]  That definitely happened to me on my turn.
[45:13.800 --> 45:15.840]  You never called it out, so I don't know if I believe that.
[45:15.900 --> 45:16.440]  I did!
[45:18.520 --> 45:19.360]  If you say so.
[45:21.440 --> 45:21.840]  Whoa.
[45:22.120 --> 45:23.160]  Geoff loves stacking.
[45:23.680 --> 45:24.320]  Oops, that was me.
[45:26.340 --> 45:27.080]  That was me.
[45:27.400 --> 45:28.820]  I didn't clear that one at all.
[45:28.880 --> 45:29.480]  I hit that one.
[45:31.300 --> 45:33.140]  I'm not calling bullshit on that.
[45:33.400 --> 45:34.460]  The only bullshit was me.
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.540]  Andrew, any thoughts?
[45:39.860 --> 45:43.140]  I was thrown off by a person on my head.
[45:43.360 --> 45:44.620]  That was on me.
[45:54.810 --> 45:55.330]  Okay.
[45:59.650 --> 46:01.170]  That was my bad.
[46:01.570 --> 46:02.230]  Yes, it was.
[46:03.890 --> 46:04.930]  This is...
[46:04.930 --> 46:09.370]  Everything else has been shit-talking because it's so easy to point at other people.
[46:09.630 --> 46:13.810]  This one is so clear when somebody personally fucks up.
[46:14.050 --> 46:15.070]  It's so good.
[46:15.310 --> 46:16.070]  This is phenomenal.
[46:16.070 --> 46:17.690]  Yeah, great.
[46:24.350 --> 46:26.310]  Oh, I hate this one.
[46:26.370 --> 46:26.950]  Oh, man.
[46:27.530 --> 46:28.650]  This is a real mother-
[46:29.490 --> 46:31.070]  I guess that one's on me.
[46:31.350 --> 46:33.030]  I felt like I cleared it. Guess I didn't.
[46:33.210 --> 46:34.050]  Sorry about it, guys.
[46:34.390 --> 46:36.070]  This one.
[46:37.330 --> 46:39.010]  Gavin, I love it.
[46:39.270 --> 46:40.310]  Gavin, I love it.
[46:40.930 --> 46:41.930]  I touched it. I'm sorry.
[46:41.930 --> 46:44.250]  You said you loved it.
[46:44.290 --> 46:45.970]  I'm sorry, I did love it.
[46:46.130 --> 46:48.970]  I loved it. I loved it so much, I'm sorry.
[46:49.470 --> 46:50.550]  You took the love and you kicked it out the freaking window.
[46:50.990 --> 46:51.690]  That was me.
[46:52.150 --> 46:52.970]  Absolutely me.
[46:53.330 --> 46:56.030]  It's been a while. I forgot what it felt like.
[46:56.530 --> 46:57.550]  Chris says,
[46:57.950 --> 47:00.390]  Make five jumps difficulty impossible.
[47:01.250 --> 47:04.510]  We literally have to jump over five things so far.
[47:05.850 --> 47:09.510]  Except because it's us, it's a 25 chance to fail.
[47:10.450 --> 47:10.850]  Jesus!
[47:11.790 --> 47:13.130]  I didn't even jump!
[47:13.510 --> 47:16.030]  I turned back to look at how everyone was doing.
[47:17.370 --> 47:18.410]  Never look back.
[47:18.830 --> 47:21.110]  Whoever edits this, we need to add a kill count.
[47:21.130 --> 47:21.850]  There's no editing.
[47:23.150 --> 47:24.790]  We gotta know who's responsible.
[47:25.530 --> 47:26.750]  For the most deaths on this level.
[47:27.390 --> 47:29.370]  I bumped into green and got pushed back.
[47:29.770 --> 47:32.170]  I was so far ahead of you, I was so far ahead of you.
[47:32.170 --> 47:33.690]  Not on my screen, right?
[47:33.690 --> 47:35.610]  This is gonna be like Jack trying to beat
[47:35.610 --> 47:37.690]  the end of that Halo thing we did.
[47:38.910 --> 47:40.270]  Oh, the vidmaster challenge?
[47:40.550 --> 47:40.590]  Yeah.
[47:41.510 --> 47:42.590]  700 attempts later.
[47:43.890 --> 47:44.570]  Gavin, you wanna go or no?
[47:44.890 --> 47:47.750]  Well, I don't know why I would go when everyone went in order
[47:47.750 --> 47:48.490]  up to that point.
[47:48.890 --> 47:50.170]  Because everyone went from the back.
[47:50.970 --> 47:52.410]  Everyone went from the back.
[47:52.530 --> 47:53.790]  Everyone was going behind me.
[47:54.490 --> 47:55.830]  Everyone went from the back?
[47:55.890 --> 47:57.810]  What are they hitting from the back?
[47:58.870 --> 48:01.270]  I cleared that on my screen. I apologized.
[48:01.530 --> 48:03.050]  I cleared it. I felt really good about it.
[48:03.050 --> 48:04.310]  Why are you apologizing if you couldn't?
[48:04.310 --> 48:05.370]  Why are you going in front of me?
[48:05.370 --> 48:07.310]  Because it showed me as the one who did it!
[48:10.170 --> 48:11.390]  Again, true ownership!
[48:12.110 --> 48:13.450]  If it's something I do!
[48:13.550 --> 48:16.210]  If it's something I do, I own it! That's mine!
[48:17.610 --> 48:19.490]  No, no, no. Hold on.
[48:19.610 --> 48:23.850]  Now that's some bullshit.
[48:24.890 --> 48:26.650]  I must have fallen back on my heels.
[48:27.010 --> 48:28.650]  If I do it, Gavin, I'll own it.
[48:28.730 --> 48:30.550]  I got no problem. If it shows that I did it,
[48:30.590 --> 48:31.210]  then I did it.
[48:31.210 --> 48:32.570]  You know what? I did it.
[48:35.270 --> 48:36.830]  I'm gonna go insane.
[48:40.670 --> 48:42.470]  What are you doing?
[48:42.850 --> 48:44.990]  I forgot. I thought I was blue.
[48:46.730 --> 48:50.530]  What do you mean?
[48:50.850 --> 48:53.010]  I thought I was blue. I don't know what happened.
[48:54.450 --> 48:56.310]  What color were you that time?
[48:57.750 --> 48:59.290]  I was a stupid color.
[49:01.210 --> 49:01.330]  Shut up.
[49:10.140 --> 49:12.100]  This is so not hard.
[49:12.500 --> 49:12.760]  No.
[49:15.840 --> 49:17.980]  No, no, no. This is right.
[49:18.500 --> 49:20.120]  Now purple has to make the jump.
[49:20.600 --> 49:21.720]  Purple has to make the jump.
[49:21.820 --> 49:22.820]  Get on me. Get on Gavin.
[49:23.380 --> 49:24.540]  Over the key. I gotcha.
[49:24.640 --> 49:27.460]  Now you go. Now you go again.
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.480]  You open the door. There you go.
[49:29.700 --> 49:31.760]  Yes! We've done it!
[49:31.760 --> 49:33.220]  No, we haven't!
[49:33.680 --> 49:34.560]  Shut your mouth.
[49:36.440 --> 49:36.840]  Yes!
[49:39.020 --> 49:42.060]  You had the opportunity to do the funniest thing.
[49:42.580 --> 49:42.840]  I know.
[49:43.980 --> 49:45.800]  I couldn't do it. I didn't have it in me.
[49:46.060 --> 49:46.660]  To do that again.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.560]  I know that you saw the content move and made the wise decision.
[49:49.880 --> 49:52.280]  Thank you so much, Andrew.
[49:52.480 --> 49:53.440]  You can't do it.
[49:54.060 --> 49:55.100]  It's been too much time.
[49:55.680 --> 49:56.680]  Did we just do it?
[49:58.040 --> 49:59.180]  We got one more.
[50:00.140 --> 50:01.600]  I feel good about one more.
[50:01.600 --> 50:03.360]  How many more levels in this game are there?
[50:03.380 --> 50:03.780]  Are there a ton?
[50:05.460 --> 50:06.560]  No, it just goes to...
[50:06.560 --> 50:08.180]  I think it's just 12, right?
[50:09.200 --> 50:09.800]  What are we doing?
[50:10.340 --> 50:11.560]  Where are we?
[50:13.580 --> 50:14.700]  Oh my God!
[50:16.120 --> 50:17.440]  What were you confused about?
[50:17.480 --> 50:18.280]  I was just very confused.
[50:18.360 --> 50:19.760]  I didn't know what category we went into.
[50:21.160 --> 50:22.140]  Don't turn around.
[50:22.440 --> 50:24.100]  You have to face him the whole time.
[50:24.340 --> 50:25.580]  No, we all faced him.
[50:26.280 --> 50:28.080]  No, we didn't.
[50:28.360 --> 50:29.680]  Geoff turned around.
[50:29.940 --> 50:30.940]  I definitely turned around.
[50:31.120 --> 50:32.360]  Alright, well, I was facing him.
[50:32.580 --> 50:35.840]  Now, I will say that apparently this isn't how it's working.
[50:36.300 --> 50:37.840]  Is it red light, green light then?
[50:38.220 --> 50:39.220]  I don't know.
[50:40.320 --> 50:41.720]  It's Granny Footsteps.
[50:42.500 --> 50:43.340]  Oh, quiet.
[50:44.940 --> 50:45.440]  Ah!
[50:45.840 --> 50:47.380]  What are we supposed to do?
[50:48.820 --> 50:49.260]  How is it?
[50:49.720 --> 50:50.900]  Move and stop?
[50:52.320 --> 50:52.880]  Stop!
[50:52.880 --> 50:53.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:53.760 --> 50:55.220]  Why don't we go in bursts?
[50:56.960 --> 50:58.540]  Okay, who's going first?
[50:58.660 --> 50:59.020]  I will.
[51:05.220 --> 51:06.560]  Is this what you mean?
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.380]  Yeah, but I assume we would all go.
[51:08.860 --> 51:09.260]  Oh, okay.
[51:11.360 --> 51:12.520]  Why is this working?
[51:13.080 --> 51:13.340]  Stop.
[51:16.260 --> 51:17.900]  Hey, guys in the back, go.
[51:18.960 --> 51:20.020]  Orange and blue.
[51:20.240 --> 51:20.760]  Orange and blue.
[51:21.040 --> 51:21.800]  Need you to catch up.
[51:21.800 --> 51:22.420]  There we go.
[51:22.580 --> 51:24.480]  Okay, so it's like a cumulative...
[51:24.480 --> 51:26.420]  Now, me and purple are going to move.
[51:29.890 --> 51:30.750]  We're going to keep going.
[51:31.070 --> 51:31.970]  Hang on, hang on.
[51:33.430 --> 51:33.990]  Hang on.
[51:35.090 --> 51:36.530]  Okay, red and orange, catch up.
[51:39.410 --> 51:40.710]  I'm not sure...
[51:40.710 --> 51:41.350]  One at a time.
[51:42.070 --> 51:44.310]  No, just don't run the whole time.
[51:48.050 --> 51:49.030]  Stop when he wakes up.
[51:52.460 --> 51:53.500]  Andrew, you are
[51:54.100 --> 51:55.580]  riding somebody's ass.
[51:58.260 --> 51:59.640]  Careful, careful, careful.
[52:00.820 --> 52:01.660]  The team
[52:01.660 --> 52:02.920]  moving to the back is great.
[52:03.380 --> 52:03.780]  Not great.
[52:05.020 --> 52:05.680]  Not good.
[52:07.640 --> 52:09.560]  Hang on, can you touch
[52:09.560 --> 52:10.980]  orange and then turn around?
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.780]  Back up, back up, back up.
[52:16.280 --> 52:16.460]  Back up.
[52:16.880 --> 52:18.960]  Now, turn orange
[52:19.370 --> 52:20.380]  and then red, get the key.
[52:20.380 --> 52:21.740]  Okay, now you turn.
[52:23.480 --> 52:24.580]  No, no, no, no.
[52:25.120 --> 52:26.600]  Okay, now...
[52:26.600 --> 52:28.000]  Hang on, wait, Nick, grab the key.
[52:28.600 --> 52:28.900]  Got it.
[52:30.420 --> 52:32.520]  I wanted to do it a little fast.
[52:34.020 --> 52:34.460]  Why?
[52:35.420 --> 52:36.860]  Why did we just mash D?
[52:37.800 --> 52:38.220]  What?
[52:39.080 --> 52:40.120]  Mashed what? D?
[52:40.820 --> 52:41.480]  That's what I'm doing.
[52:41.880 --> 52:43.320]  Oh, oh, like right?
[52:44.140 --> 52:44.360]  Yeah.
[52:47.380 --> 52:48.540]  Oh no, it keeps moving
[52:48.540 --> 52:49.180]  to the back.
[52:50.520 --> 52:52.080]  Come touch us. Touch me.
[52:52.180 --> 52:53.760]  Take it, take it, take it.
[52:54.120 --> 52:56.180]  Now just slowly take, get your ass over there.
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.240]  There you go. Okay, keep going.
[52:58.640 --> 53:00.340]  Red, fucking help, man. You gotta go.
[53:01.340 --> 53:02.600]  Andrew's just watching the game, man.
[53:03.220 --> 53:04.200]  I'm giving him time.
[53:08.200 --> 53:09.500]  Don't, oh, don't get cocky.
[53:14.860 --> 53:15.580]  So easy.
[53:15.780 --> 53:17.200]  This is so easy. Baby mode.
[53:17.200 --> 53:18.020]  This is simple.
[53:18.540 --> 53:19.940]  Oh my god, he's coming.
[53:20.340 --> 53:21.060]  Oh, he's pissed.
[53:22.780 --> 53:24.160]  Oh, he was so mad.
[53:24.700 --> 53:26.700]  I went for it. Big time angry.
[53:27.820 --> 53:28.380]  Oh man.
[53:29.800 --> 53:30.200]  Oh.
[53:31.400 --> 53:32.640]  Okay. What's this shit?
[53:32.960 --> 53:34.920]  What the fuck? Am I supposed to touch him?
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.140]  Should I touch him? Yeah, try.
[53:37.240 --> 53:39.380]  Sorry, I didn't think
[53:39.380 --> 53:40.620]  about how that would hurt you.
[53:42.460 --> 53:43.360]  Okay, I don't want to
[53:43.360 --> 53:44.140]  write on you, I'm sorry.
[53:44.140 --> 53:45.820]  I don't think I want to touch him.
[53:46.180 --> 53:48.260]  It's gonna, I mean, clearly it's gonna kill you.
[53:48.520 --> 53:49.460]  I can jump on him?
[53:49.800 --> 53:52.320]  You jump on him, and then we jump on top of you
[53:52.320 --> 53:53.780]  maybe to get over him. Oh, that's a good idea.
[53:56.560 --> 53:57.440]  No. Nope. I don't know.
[53:57.460 --> 53:58.700]  Can you guys jump on him?
[53:59.840 --> 54:02.220]  Cause everyone's just getting hit by him. I'm just jumping.
[54:02.800 --> 54:03.160]  Oh.
[54:04.700 --> 54:06.100]  Oh, you can't just jump on him.
[54:06.140 --> 54:08.460]  So it's not about the color, it's just, you can just do that.
[54:08.540 --> 54:08.960]  Got it.
[54:09.700 --> 54:11.560]  What does the light mean at the top?
[54:11.940 --> 54:13.120]  Oh, red light, green light.
[54:13.540 --> 54:14.900]  Oh, for God's sake.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.020]  Okay, alright.
[54:17.080 --> 54:18.580]  So we just gotta get on the other side of this guy fast.
[54:20.980 --> 54:23.020]  Alright, blue was on top of me, I couldn't jump.
[54:27.200 --> 54:27.560]  Blue.
[54:36.040 --> 54:36.760]  Alright, round.
[54:37.800 --> 54:38.640]  How did I die?
[54:45.350 --> 54:46.490]  Oh, that was me.
[54:48.230 --> 54:49.910]  It's the bugs all over again.
[54:50.330 --> 54:51.470]  Yeah, that was me.
[54:52.150 --> 54:53.410]  Eric, must you?
[54:53.530 --> 54:55.910]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[54:56.390 --> 54:57.530]  What kind of question is that, bud?
[54:57.610 --> 54:58.490]  Stop. Hold up, stop.
[54:59.690 --> 55:01.890]  Okay, we could've gone, but...
[55:05.110 --> 55:05.810]  It's a long light.
[55:07.310 --> 55:08.130]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[55:08.710 --> 55:10.010]  Yeah. Oh no.
[55:10.310 --> 55:11.890]  Oh no. Oh no.
[55:12.030 --> 55:14.310]  Oh no. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[55:14.850 --> 55:16.490]  Oh no. Oh no.
[55:17.250 --> 55:17.990]  We're almost there.
[55:18.410 --> 55:20.030]  Oh no, take five! Hold the line, hold the line.
[55:20.110 --> 55:20.550]  Don't move!
[55:25.090 --> 55:26.050]  Ready? Ready?
[55:26.270 --> 55:28.830]  Ready? Ready? Go, go, go, go.
[55:30.910 --> 55:31.930]  All the way!
[55:38.530 --> 55:38.990]  Stop.
[55:39.750 --> 55:40.550]  Ooh, orange was quick.
[55:41.970 --> 55:45.330]  So I think we need to push it...
[55:45.790 --> 55:46.790]  Oh, how far?
[55:48.370 --> 55:50.330]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[55:50.730 --> 55:51.010]  Red!
[55:52.510 --> 55:54.270]  Orange, jump up, grab that, push it down.
[55:55.230 --> 55:56.590]  Oh, fuck, is this gonna be far enough?
[55:57.550 --> 55:59.070]  Wait, we need to get on the other side.
[55:59.070 --> 56:00.390]  Don't move. Oh, stop, stop, stop.
[56:00.410 --> 56:01.810]  I think I just fucked us.
[56:02.110 --> 56:02.670]  No, we're okay.
[56:03.950 --> 56:06.030]  No, because all five of us can't get to the same spot.
[56:06.290 --> 56:06.930]  Yeah, you're right, we're boned.
[56:07.030 --> 56:09.070]  No, I think we can, though, if you push...
[56:09.070 --> 56:10.190]  Oh no. We can go.
[56:11.070 --> 56:12.730]  Yeah, we're boned.
[56:13.930 --> 56:14.290]  That's...
[56:14.290 --> 56:16.350]  Well, no, no, no.
[56:16.550 --> 56:17.390]  Just push a little bit.
[56:18.590 --> 56:19.150]  I'm stuck.
[56:20.090 --> 56:21.570]  I got it, I got it.
[56:22.570 --> 56:24.270]  Now we don't have to do any of this.
[56:24.430 --> 56:27.470]  We can just go to the exit.
[56:27.750 --> 56:28.850]  Everyone can just go to the exit.
[56:29.250 --> 56:30.150]  Yeah, I think so.
[56:30.570 --> 56:31.690]  I can't make that jump.
[56:32.870 --> 56:33.970]  Okay, red, push that down.
[56:34.670 --> 56:34.990]  To where?
[56:37.190 --> 56:39.290]  Well, we need five people to move the other thing.
[56:39.430 --> 56:39.990]  We need to come back out.
[56:40.590 --> 56:41.550]  Wait, wait, wait.
[56:41.570 --> 56:44.090]  If you come back out...
[56:44.090 --> 56:46.290]  We all have to go down there.
[56:47.610 --> 56:48.590]  We can do it, it's fine.
[56:48.690 --> 56:49.330]  We're good, we're good.
[56:49.530 --> 56:50.850]  If I'm touching it, does that count?
[56:51.890 --> 56:53.930]  Purple, I need you to push that to...
[56:53.930 --> 56:55.230]  push the single one.
[56:55.570 --> 56:58.290]  Can we just stand on the block and then he can push it?
[56:59.410 --> 56:59.810]  Does it?
[56:59.970 --> 57:01.430]  Oh, we can all just come down here. Okay, great.
[57:01.770 --> 57:03.570]  Yeah, that's what we're about to do.
[57:04.850 --> 57:06.350]  Hey, Geoff, I think that was you.
[57:06.350 --> 57:07.310]  That was me, sorry.
[57:08.670 --> 57:10.170]  All of that work!
[57:10.830 --> 57:12.370]  All of that work.
[57:13.670 --> 57:14.750]  All of that work.
[57:14.850 --> 57:16.930]  It wasn't that hard after we figured out how to jump a slug.
[57:17.030 --> 57:19.130]  We were adjusting so much.
[57:23.420 --> 57:24.320]  Hold up, stop!
[57:25.800 --> 57:26.740]  Wait, so much time.
[57:28.400 --> 57:29.860]  Jump a slug.
[57:30.820 --> 57:31.240]  That's me.
[57:32.860 --> 57:34.200]  Why was it you?
[57:34.860 --> 57:35.340]  Why?
[57:36.740 --> 57:37.420]  I just...
[57:37.420 --> 57:37.740]  fucked up.
[57:39.440 --> 57:41.220]  You know what? I respect that.
[57:41.580 --> 57:43.500]  Yeah, I mean, I don't have an excuse for anything.
[57:43.580 --> 57:44.140]  I just sucked.
[57:47.290 --> 57:49.230]  My hand's way away from the fucking keyboard,
[57:49.370 --> 57:49.770]  I'll tell you that.
[57:50.050 --> 57:50.390]  Ready?
[57:52.450 --> 57:52.930]  Let's go!
[57:56.540 --> 57:57.140]  Got the key?
[57:57.620 --> 57:59.060]  Push it all the way to the wall.
[57:59.780 --> 58:01.320]  Is that what we have to do? Is that what we're doing?
[58:01.320 --> 58:02.120]  Pushing it all the way?
[58:03.840 --> 58:04.180]  Stop.
[58:04.940 --> 58:05.420]  Red.
[58:05.580 --> 58:06.160]  Oh my god.
[58:08.360 --> 58:09.740]  Nothing went wrong!
[58:09.900 --> 58:12.480]  Don't go red me, I didn't cause us to die.
[58:12.760 --> 58:13.300]  It was fine.
[58:13.500 --> 58:15.100]  No, it was fine.
[58:15.560 --> 58:16.680]  It was just close.
[58:16.880 --> 58:17.540]  It was really close.
[58:19.260 --> 58:22.180]  Hey, you took some gambles.
[58:23.800 --> 58:24.200]  Okay, hold.
[58:27.480 --> 58:29.320]  So we're going all the way to the wall?
[58:30.300 --> 58:30.420]  Yeah.
[58:31.380 --> 58:32.000]  Why not?
[58:32.440 --> 58:33.660]  Do we have to catch the one?
[58:34.620 --> 58:36.400]  No, it needs to drop for the person.
[58:36.520 --> 58:38.060]  To jump up to the big one.
[58:38.140 --> 58:38.520]  Go for it.
[58:40.800 --> 58:41.380]  Everyone up.
[58:43.040 --> 58:43.740]  Not sure.
[58:47.840 --> 58:49.500]  The fuck y'all did that to me?
[58:51.080 --> 58:52.820]  All you needed was green to jump into it.
[58:53.220 --> 58:55.480]  All I needed was everybody to get off my stupid head.
[58:55.940 --> 58:56.660]  So I could jump.
[58:56.940 --> 58:58.460]  Now get this thing off me.
[58:59.980 --> 59:00.580]  Thank you.
[59:00.640 --> 59:02.280]  No, I agree. I mean, I'm with you.
[59:03.080 --> 59:03.680]  Let's go.
[59:06.740 --> 59:08.300]  I'm not going to be the one to kill us here.
[59:09.640 --> 59:11.160]  Oh, if you are, I'm going to be mad.
[59:15.270 --> 59:15.970]  There we go.
[59:16.230 --> 59:17.130]  Oh, we did it.
[59:18.290 --> 59:19.810]  Why did you come back out?
[59:20.630 --> 59:22.090]  Hey, just checking on you guys. You okay?
[59:23.450 --> 59:24.310]  Hey, where'd you go?
[59:24.830 --> 59:25.450]  Hey, where you been?
[59:28.210 --> 59:31.090]  I've got to remember to take shits on Friday afternoons.
[59:34.970 --> 59:37.270]  This is the one that we have to look at the whole time.
[59:37.490 --> 59:37.550]  Yeah.
[59:39.550 --> 59:40.650]  As soon as he turns.
[59:41.010 --> 59:42.210]  I'll turn back to watch.
[59:42.470 --> 59:44.690]  Go, Gavin.
[59:44.950 --> 59:45.510]  Blue, go.
[59:46.390 --> 59:48.110]  I think as long as one of us is watching.
[59:49.090 --> 59:50.690]  So somebody else moves so I can...
[59:50.690 --> 59:51.690]  Are we in a rush?
[59:51.690 --> 59:53.410]  We're all looking at him.
[59:54.690 --> 59:55.690]  That's why I said...
[59:55.690 --> 59:56.150]  Everybody go.
[59:56.210 --> 59:56.350]  Go.
[59:59.410 --> 01:00:00.290]  Alright, I'll watch.
[01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:01.870]  Here's what we're going to do. Geoff, you go.
[01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:03.470]  Geoff, go.
[01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:05.270]  I'm watching.
[01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.150]  I'm watching.
[01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:10.070]  Keep going.
[01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.090]  I'm watching.
[01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:14.690]  Let me get on purple head.
[01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.170]  He has to follow us a little bit.
[01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:18.670]  He has to follow us a little bit.
[01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.430]  Okay, a little bit more.
[01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.790]  What the fuck?
[01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.150]  Oh, no!
[01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:25.330]  I got it.
[01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.730]  Gavin, you're going to keep watching him.
[01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:30.390]  You're going to get off...
[01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:31.650]  Get off Andrew.
[01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.010]  That's me, I'm Nick.
[01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.410]  I'm sorry, get off Nick.
[01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:37.330]  Somebody better get off.
[01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:40.970]  It's not what I meant, but it's fine.
[01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:41.250]  Alright.
[01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:42.150]  I'm watching.
[01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.230]  Now we'll be able to go after we get this thing.
[01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:47.250]  You just keep watching.
[01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:48.850]  Nick, do you know this guy?
[01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:50.750]  Alright, let's go.
[01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:53.270]  He looks familiar.
[01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.170]  Geoff knows him now.
[01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:01.990]  Okay, I'm moving. We need someone to watch.
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:03.230]  Okay, I'm watching now.
[01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.290]  Keep coming. The person in the front should watch.
[01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:07.030]  Yeah.
[01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:09.690]  Okay, now...
[01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.730]  Orange is going to watch. Never mind.
[01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.670]  Orange is watching.
[01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:17.930]  Orange is going to watch.
[01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:19.830]  I'm going to start moving. Ready? Here we go.
[01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.810]  Okay, we did it.
[01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:23.470]  We got to let him catch up a little.
[01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:26.070]  Alright.
[01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:26.930]  More.
[01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:32.170]  Okay, I've got it over here.
[01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:33.470]  I got you.
[01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:35.150]  That didn't even touch you.
[01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:38.610]  That did not touch you.
[01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:39.530]  That's not on you, Andrew.
[01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:41.150]  Okay.
[01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.090]  I'm going to go.
[01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:44.810]  And now I'm watching.
[01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:47.030]  Okay, Gavin's watching.
[01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.470]  Okay, there we go.
[01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.210]  I'm blue.
[01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.750]  Yeah, you were watching.
[01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:54.190]  Nick, you can go. I'm watching.
[01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:57.790]  Now turn around. We got to let him get a little bit closer.
[01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:00.030]  Whoever's on the head can do the watching and the turning.
[01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.130]  Holy God.
[01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.590]  There we go.
[01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:06.530]  Alright.
[01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:09.950]  Alright, I'm going to stand here and watch.
[01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:11.510]  You guys can all move forward.
[01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.650]  We need to get him a little bit closer.
[01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:14.050]  Okay, he's coming closer.
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:15.210]  A little more.
[01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.510]  Red.
[01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:25.150]  No, Nick, we need him to get a little...
[01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.650]  Fuck.
[01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:26.610]  That was a little too much.
[01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.670]  I think we were fine just getting over the pipe there.
[01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:30.630]  Yeah, we could have just jumped over the pipe.
[01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.730]  We didn't need him to be closer.
[01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:34.050]  Well...
[01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:38.370]  Okay.
[01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:40.590]  I'm watching.
[01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:41.850]  I'm watching. Now everyone come.
[01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.110]  Nick, get on me.
[01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:45.590]  Unfortunate phrasing, Eric.
[01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.030]  Okay, so now, Nick, you're going to...
[01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:49.670]  Yeah, I'll watch.
[01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:52.030]  Got it. Okay, we're all going to move.
[01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.550]  Boys.
[01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:57.230]  We got to get him a little bit closer.
[01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.310]  Eric.
[01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:01.610]  Okay, let me look that way for a sec.
[01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.330]  Okay.
[01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.250]  Okay, everybody look the other way.
[01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.250]  Look right. Look left.
[01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:11.930]  Okay.
[01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:13.310]  Alright.
[01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:17.210]  There's a bit of a delay when he gets caught.
[01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.530]  Okay, we got to get him
[01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.250]  a little closer now so everyone move in.
[01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:22.910]  I'm watching him. I'm going to turn.
[01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:23.750]  Ready?
[01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:24.910]  Now.
[01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.050]  Okay, there we go.
[01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.350]  Nick will go first.
[01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.230]  I'm going to pass my buddy here.
[01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:32.890]  I'll be the last one to cross.
[01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:34.990]  I'm still watching him. I'll be the last one to cross.
[01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:36.850]  I'll be right here to give us space.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.260]  Alright, go.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.980]  I couldn't because someone was on my head.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.040]  I just wanted to be super safe.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.400]  I got killed by him last time.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.120]  It burned.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.300]  It's not a fun death.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:52.560]  Alright.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.480]  Okay, we got to let him catch up a little bit.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.040]  Gavin, move up.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.260]  Alright, who's going to watch?
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.340]  I'm watching him.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.280]  Does he have to get the key?
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.400]  He gets the key.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.080]  Do you think that's what it is?
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.900]  Someone of us will stand down here.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:09.520]  There we go.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.320]  Now we got to look away from him now.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.480]  Back at him.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:16.280]  Hang on.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.220]  Blue, you're doing this.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.280]  Blue, you're doing this.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.000]  Gavin, I think you're way too close.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.760]  Someone look at him so I can get away from him.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.000]  I got it.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.240]  I'm going to stay up here just in case we need to be up here.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:29.440]  Okay.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.680]  I'm watching him. I'm going to turn away and see if he gets the key.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.260]  He gets the key.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.520]  Why don't you be the designated pervert?
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.720]  We need someone to go down to get the key.
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.500]  I got it.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:41.500]  You got it?
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.800]  Nick, you watch all the way up, Andrew.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:46.760]  Yep, I'm watching.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.240]  Geoff.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.000]  If you mofs leave without me.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.000]  I can't.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.340]  I'm watching from here.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.200]  I'm watching from here.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:56.960]  Geoff, go in.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.320]  Nice!
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.100]  Perfect.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.920]  What a round.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.540]  Last level.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.300]  Last one.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.920]  You'll be able to watch this again on Tuesday.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.140]  See how I was right the whole time.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.860]  With a perfect
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.940]  in sync
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.160]  Gavin.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:20.360]  Gavin.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.740]  Do you think this counts as a speed run because we're doing so well?
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:25.200]  No.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.060]  Wait.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.500]  What is that bar?
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.740]  Is it some sort of jump bar?
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:33.640]  No.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.560]  Hold on, stop.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.120]  Shut up!
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.660]  Oh, it is a jump bar. We have to keep jumping.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.120]  We have to move the whole time.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.760]  Hold right. Let's go.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.480]  Alright.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.280]  That's not doing anything either.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.220]  Is it a stop bar?
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.700]  What are we supposed to do?
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.340]  I think we have to stop and let it refill.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.560]  Alright, everyone stop moving.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.480]  It's a stop sign.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.120]  Purple killed me there.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.200]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:02.540]  I'm sorry.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:03.820]  That's okay.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.520]  I killed myself there.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.100]  Shitty jump on my part.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.180]  Wow.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.020]  Alright, let's try it.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.120]  Let's try it. All get over the slug.
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.420]  And then stop.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.480]  I don't think we're going to all make it over the slug.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.120]  To be fair, there was a lot of
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.560]  dicking about before we...
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.700]  There was a lot of butt slamming before we got to the slug.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.080]  A lot of butt slamming.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.200]  Go, go, go. Jump, jump, jump, jump. Stop.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:37.680]  Hold.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.200]  Here, let's stack up.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.760]  Me. Okay, you.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.820]  Lots of corn in the chat.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.660]  See that corn?
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:51.760]  Stop.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:55.520]  Orange,
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.180]  I guess just jump the slugs.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.320]  Yeah, I'm just going to have to jump the slugs.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.820]  Blue, if you start jumping,
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.800]  you might give orange enough leverage to get up there.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.720]  Or they could fall.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.580]  Just wait for it. You got it.
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.680]  You got it, Geoff. You're fine.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:10.440]  Alright.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.800]  Jump. Okay, Geoff, we're going to put you on the
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.580]  top platform.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.780]  I'm going to be a top slug. Who's still going?
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:18.460]  Geoff!
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:22.200]  I lost my focus.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:22.960]  Just hold right.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.800]  Everyone hold right at the very beginning.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.140]  Just hold it before it even starts.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:27.680]  Stop.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.840]  Okay, Geoff, you're in the front.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.540]  You shouldn't be.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.440]  So anyway.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.520]  Geoff, you're in the middle. You shouldn't be.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.300]  Oh, balls.
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.180]  We're going to have to stop moving.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.660]  Alright, let purple get back up.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:47.660]  Uh, yeah.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.100]  Yeah. Okay.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:49.800]  Okay.
[01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:54.810]  Alright, let purple get back up.
[01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:56.990]  I just don't... This is not...
[01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.070]  This isn't the hard part.
[01:07:58.290 --> 01:07:59.870]  I got it. I'm not going to move.
[01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:02.510]  Go, Geoff.
[01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:04.270]  He can't because red's in the way.
[01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.350]  He's standing in front of him.
[01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.930]  Go, Geoff.
[01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:09.850]  Why aren't you going around?
[01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.910]  Nick, on you.
[01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:13.930]  Alright. If you jump...
[01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:17.570]  There we go.
[01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:18.110]  Nice.
[01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:21.730]  Nobody else go.
[01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:23.710]  Wow, are you out of your fucking mind?
[01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:27.390]  I gave you enough energy.
[01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:30.250]  You are... Oh, I'm going to kill you.
[01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:31.570]  I'm going to kill you in real life.
[01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:31.850]  No.
[01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:32.630]  No.
[01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.790]  Gavin, how are you feeling?
[01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:39.010]  Pretty good. Oh, Gavin's got this. That's easy.
[01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:40.470]  Baby mode shit. Hang on. Hang on.
[01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:42.310]  Okay, now purple.
[01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:44.410]  Now red.
[01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.550]  You don't have to go one at a time.
[01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.470]  It's just the group.
[01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:52.710]  What the fuck?
[01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:57.550]  I think it's just a general
[01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.490]  lack of trust.
[01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:59.390]  I almost went.
[01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:02.710]  It's absolutely a general lack of trust.
[01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:03.210]  100%.
[01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:05.730]  You got it.
[01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:11.370]  Don't get real.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.100]  What? What do you want from me?
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.320]  Okay, ready? Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.680]  Okay, everyone's pushing.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.560]  Everyone's pushing and then I'll start. Ready?
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.340]  Here we go.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.720]  Everyone keep pushing. I'll monitor.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.700]  No, no, no, no, no. You guys keep pushing.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.120]  Good techers.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.720]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:44.960]  Go green.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.960]  Okay. Okay, hold it. Hold it.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.500]  We're so close. Stop!
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.320]  Again!
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.820]  It's not one at a time.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.200]  It's just the group bar.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.660]  Okay. Go in.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.160]  Go!
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.780]  Oh, we did it.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.640]  Easiest game in the world.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.660]  This is why we started a company, guys.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.220]  Easy stuff.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.640]  Survived two days this week.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.060]  Oh, man.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.420]  I'm sweating so bad like we played
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.020]  Chain together.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.860]  Two days in June.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.080]  I'm going to take a shower after this.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.840]  Guys, we did it. Thank you so much for watching.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.940]  Everyone here, if you want to watch this VOD, you can.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.780]  It'll be out Tuesday on our
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.940]  Regulation Gameplay channel.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.240]  Make sure you let people know about this.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.860]  We have more videos coming out soon.

[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.960]  You nailed it that time.

[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.500]  Thank you to everyone watching on Twitch.

[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.440]  We got the
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.100]  Regulation logo.
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.460]  We also have CornCat and PissRat.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.360]  They're going bonkers in here.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.580]  If you guys want to be here

[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.980]  That is 5 p.m.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.500]  Eastern, 2 p.m. Pacific.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.220]  Thank you guys so much for joining
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.280]  us for this livestream.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.240]  Guys, any thoughts on Pico Park? This was Meg's fault.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.320]  I liked it a lot.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.280]  I think our teamwork shone through.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.140]  I think it's pretty clear that we're a
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.580]  well-organized machine.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.960]  I feel like Eric
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.000]  was 100% mouth, but
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.520]  only 50% right.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.360]  Watch this back
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.300]  on Tuesday and watch how right I am
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.840]  the whole time. It's so
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.280]  embarrassing for you guys how right
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.600]  I am the whole time.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.360]  I'm not entirely sure that's what we're going to find.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.240]  I don't think so.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.380]  You know what? It remains to be seen
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:52.860]  on Tuesday.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.500]  Let me know in the chat.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.040]  Everyone,
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.140]  Eric's right in the chat.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.500]  For all the times, Eric was right.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:01.920]  Ray back, because he rated me.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:02.980]  Yeah, sure.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.220]  He needs the support.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.440]  And let us know if you want to play
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.680]  the other five levels of this.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.960]  We have to.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.560]  We have to wear little hats.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.200]  Go back around. I think you skipped one.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.040]  It says offline.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.200]  Oh.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.380]  But that might not literally be...
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.800]  Try clicking it.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:28.800]  Okay.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.420]  I didn't know if that's what it was called.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.880]  Alright, did you rate him?
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.020]  Not yet.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.200]  It's Andrew, isn't it?
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.440]  He's already doing it.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.040]  Guys, participate
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.160]  in the raid. You can get
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.140]  what's our channel currency called? Regulation
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.320]  points. Come back and probably bet
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.300]  those later. I'm sure we'll get some bets going with our
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.360]  mods. Fantastic mods. Fantastic job
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.900]  everyone. Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.300]  We really appreciate you so much. Tell Ray
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.320]  we say hi. And let
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.220]  him know that Geoff supports him personally.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.660]  I'm not dead.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.100]  I'm not dying.
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.280]  Alright, and go ahead and hit that
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.760]  raid. Bye!
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:09.680]  Bye!
