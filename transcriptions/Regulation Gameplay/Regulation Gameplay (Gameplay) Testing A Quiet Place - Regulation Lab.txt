[00:00.000 --> 00:05.660]  Hello and welcome to the regulation lab. We're here to test things out.
[00:06.060 --> 00:06.840]  Oh, this is the lab?
[00:07.420 --> 00:09.600]  This is the lab. We're doing lab work.
[00:09.760 --> 00:11.080]  I just drooled all over myself.
[00:11.520 --> 00:14.520]  What? Is that part of the lab work?
[00:14.700 --> 00:16.800]  I was swigging water through the whole sink.
[00:17.080 --> 00:17.160]  You know what?
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.760]  It could be. Honestly, it could fit for the lab work.
[00:21.120 --> 00:23.260]  I was given a code for the quiet place game.
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.200]  I've been playing it and really enjoying it.
[00:25.340 --> 00:27.020]  A lot of fun. Terrifying.
[00:27.020 --> 00:32.200]  One of the things they added in this game is the ability for your mic
[00:32.200 --> 00:36.520]  to make noise, and that can alert the monsters in the game.
[00:36.600 --> 00:38.840]  What? It's a whole thing.
[00:39.340 --> 00:45.300]  And so I thought, what better way for us to test the limits of the world?
[00:45.500 --> 00:48.860]  Because like as a viewer of the movie, you always wonder, like,
[00:48.880 --> 00:51.320]  obviously they're going to be dramatic moments where the monsters get revealed.
[00:51.600 --> 00:52.900]  You never see mundane things.
[00:52.900 --> 00:55.400]  Or maybe like you wonder, could I do this
[00:55.400 --> 00:57.860]  and not alert the monster type thing?
[00:58.300 --> 00:59.940]  So I have a variety of things we're going to test.
[01:00.260 --> 01:02.500]  Everyday things. Scenarios you can see.
[01:02.620 --> 01:06.340]  So if you're in this position, you'll know if you're safe or not.
[01:08.420 --> 01:09.960]  We're going to run through right here.
[01:10.060 --> 01:11.100]  I'll explain the mechanic of the game.
[01:11.560 --> 01:13.460]  See on the oh, shit. Oh, no.
[01:13.740 --> 01:18.100]  Oh, no. Oh, oh, the monster.
[01:20.040 --> 01:22.480]  So so that's so that's the game.
[01:25.020 --> 01:25.980]  Oh, OK.
[01:26.260 --> 01:27.600]  Well, we're going to continue.
[01:27.780 --> 01:29.980]  So we're going to check off explaining rules.
[01:30.060 --> 01:32.120]  I'll get you killed. Yeah, I'm going to have to.
[01:32.320 --> 01:34.300]  I got to remember to mute my other mic.
[01:34.400 --> 01:36.140]  I'm wearing two microphones right now.
[01:37.460 --> 01:39.020]  You're you're ridiculous.
[01:39.260 --> 01:40.900]  OK, so now we're back here.
[01:41.020 --> 01:45.000]  So you see this thing on the. Oh, no, no, I didn't get my accident.
[01:45.580 --> 01:48.180]  Shit. You're. How did that happen?
[01:48.620 --> 01:50.220]  This is the lab.
[01:50.700 --> 01:51.920]  The lab is fun.
[01:51.940 --> 01:53.860]  The lab's a painful place to be.
[01:54.920 --> 01:57.480]  OK, Geoff, are you like in the lab so far?
[01:57.560 --> 02:00.040]  This is lasted about as long as a H lab.
[02:00.240 --> 02:01.320]  Gavin and I created that.
[02:02.200 --> 02:04.100]  Oh, OK.
[02:04.740 --> 02:09.760]  So as you see on the left, that blue bar is the world noise.
[02:10.160 --> 02:14.020]  The right bar is how much noise the character is making.
[02:14.080 --> 02:15.500]  OK. And or the mic.
[02:15.600 --> 02:17.080]  So if you exceed back, you did it again.
[02:17.540 --> 02:19.400]  Why? Why is it picking me up?
[02:19.400 --> 02:21.040]  You did. You did.
[02:21.760 --> 02:23.240]  Well, you weren't muted for the beginning there.
[02:24.180 --> 02:25.860]  No, but I'm my other heads.
[02:25.960 --> 02:28.220]  I should be OK. I'm I'm I'm.
[02:30.380 --> 02:32.620]  We've we've watched him die three times.
[02:32.760 --> 02:34.800]  He has not taken a single step.
[02:35.380 --> 02:36.640]  I haven't taken a step.
[02:36.680 --> 02:39.300]  I haven't we've even tested any of the things I have to test.
[02:39.600 --> 02:41.140]  What do you say?
[02:41.560 --> 02:44.040]  Maybe we should have tested this before we got into the game.
[02:45.300 --> 02:46.440]  Oh, no, I've been tested.
[02:46.620 --> 02:47.960]  Listen, OK, don't listen.
[02:48.080 --> 02:48.500]  Now we're good.
[02:48.500 --> 02:50.480]  Now it's not accidentally picking it up.
[02:50.540 --> 02:52.240]  We're all fine. What changed?
[02:52.960 --> 02:54.700]  I pushed the mic further back.
[02:54.780 --> 02:57.580]  It's one of those slide back mic things to mute.
[02:57.980 --> 02:58.840]  I see. Now we're all good.
[02:59.060 --> 03:01.660]  OK, so the noise on the right, that is our noise.
[03:02.260 --> 03:05.300]  Now, as you watch it now, obviously in movies, you're not going to encounter
[03:05.300 --> 03:08.680]  these things, but they're they're they're issues we have as people.
[03:09.200 --> 03:12.960]  And so the first thing, the first test I've wondered as a viewer of these films,
[03:13.520 --> 03:15.360]  can you fart and be OK?
[03:15.360 --> 03:19.020]  OK, Andrew, where are you going to get farts from?
[03:19.280 --> 03:20.820]  But where am I going to get farts from?
[03:21.100 --> 03:25.320]  I had a whole thing of trying to find a whoopee cushion all over town.
[03:25.460 --> 03:26.720]  I couldn't find one.
[03:26.880 --> 03:28.780]  And then I realized I don't need one.
[03:29.340 --> 03:31.620]  We have fart logs from Geoff.
[03:31.780 --> 03:33.480]  Yep. We have fart audio.
[03:33.740 --> 03:37.040]  So, Geoff, this is specifically for there's no better test.
[03:37.200 --> 03:39.100]  I mean, this is an officially licensed game.
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.880]  You'll be able to know after this if you can safely fart in.
[03:44.620 --> 03:46.360]  Man, a quiet place scenario.
[03:46.560 --> 03:48.820]  We could run all the farts and see which ones got him killed.
[03:49.920 --> 03:52.740]  I feel really bad now because I almost included me
[03:52.740 --> 03:56.080]  having diarrhea in the toilet in one as a joke, but then I didn't.
[03:56.180 --> 03:56.940]  But now I can't remember if I had.
[03:57.080 --> 03:58.060]  You're Mike. You're Mike.
[03:58.140 --> 04:00.880]  Oh, shit. It hurt you guys.
[04:02.220 --> 04:03.680]  Is it hearing the discord?
[04:04.380 --> 04:05.600]  I think it might be.
[04:06.060 --> 04:07.040]  I'm also making noise.
[04:07.300 --> 04:08.660]  OK, this we're going to reset.
[04:09.080 --> 04:10.360]  Fucking everybody quiet.
[04:10.620 --> 04:11.600]  We're doing the test.
[04:23.120 --> 04:23.920]  Oh, oh.
[04:46.780 --> 04:48.920]  So we're seeing them, but not hearing them.
[04:50.160 --> 04:51.680]  But it just spikes.
[04:54.720 --> 04:55.820]  Geoff, your farts are secure.
[04:55.940 --> 04:57.460]  I know discord didn't pick up any of them.
[04:57.900 --> 04:59.100]  I just went through the whole gambit.
[04:59.660 --> 05:03.800]  No, no, we can see we can see it is pretty good.
[05:04.540 --> 05:05.580]  Oh, why? God damn it.
[05:06.500 --> 05:07.120]  I'll try to mute.
[05:07.800 --> 05:08.860]  OK, so farts are secure.
[05:08.860 --> 05:10.280]  You can fart in a quiet place.
[05:10.440 --> 05:11.160]  You can fart in a quiet place.
[05:11.320 --> 05:11.560]  No problem.
[05:11.820 --> 05:13.960]  So small spikes of audio are OK.
[05:16.120 --> 05:17.720]  Let's move on to the test.
[05:18.640 --> 05:21.480]  Next thing I have, let me let me let me get my notes out here of all the
[05:21.480 --> 05:23.980]  all the things we could go through here.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.120]  You got a bag of crisps.
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.440]  I do. Actually, that's great.
[05:27.560 --> 05:29.460]  Gavin, let's do a bag of crisps.
[05:29.920 --> 05:30.420]  Yeah, here we go.
[05:31.000 --> 05:31.880]  Test is beginning.
[05:36.940 --> 05:41.260]  Oh, God, I just want the chips.
[05:41.760 --> 05:43.240]  I just want some chips.
[05:43.440 --> 05:45.060]  Why don't you want the chips?
[05:46.000 --> 05:46.860]  Did you even eat?
[05:46.900 --> 05:47.800]  Why don't we just opening?
[05:48.360 --> 05:50.500]  I'm still haven't opened them.
[05:52.200 --> 05:55.580]  You'll be dead before you put the chip to your lip.
[05:56.080 --> 05:59.060]  All right. Now test if you if you happen to have a bag open.
[06:00.540 --> 06:03.800]  Yeah, see if you can just get it like already have it open.
[06:03.800 --> 06:05.620]  Now reach in and eat a chip and see.
[06:05.880 --> 06:10.340]  Maybe you just have to have a friend or an enemy open the bag
[06:10.340 --> 06:11.560]  and then you can eat the chip.
[06:11.740 --> 06:12.600]  You open it with scissors.
[06:16.700 --> 06:18.720]  Oh, look at Geoff with the big ideas.
[06:18.800 --> 06:19.640]  Trying to stay alive here.
[06:20.300 --> 06:22.180]  I think Andrew might just be eating the chips already.
[06:22.580 --> 06:23.440]  Well, I'm opening them.
[06:23.480 --> 06:24.700]  OK. You want me to bite them?
[06:25.080 --> 06:26.860]  Yeah. Yeah. Bag has been opened.
[06:27.100 --> 06:27.900]  This is a great test.
[06:28.420 --> 06:29.840]  Mm hmm. Testing a chip bite.
[06:31.840 --> 06:33.460]  Testing a chip bite.
[06:35.460 --> 06:36.800]  Is that each chew?
[06:37.060 --> 06:38.140]  Yeah, I think I think he's chewing.
[06:39.220 --> 06:40.060]  They chomping down.
[06:40.500 --> 06:41.900]  You might go away with it.
[06:43.220 --> 06:48.220]  Yep. So you can fart and eat potato chips all day long in a quiet place.
[06:48.640 --> 06:50.020]  Yeah. So it's just like living now.
[06:50.980 --> 06:52.120]  What's different, you know?
[06:53.200 --> 06:54.380]  Toast. Toast.
[06:56.120 --> 06:57.660]  Yeah, he's going to eat the whole bag.
[06:58.180 --> 06:58.960]  Of course.
[06:58.960 --> 07:01.440]  I think the big spike is his first bite.
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.220]  And then the green ones are his crunching.
[07:04.240 --> 07:06.760]  Chewing. Oh, I died on the mute.
[07:06.880 --> 07:08.320]  That doesn't count. I died on the mute.
[07:08.820 --> 07:09.960]  Nice. So that was safe.
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.520]  You can eat chips. Chips are approved.
[07:11.660 --> 07:13.100]  Yeah, looks like it.
[07:14.080 --> 07:14.960]  What else you got?
[07:15.440 --> 07:18.040]  Next edible item, a cosmic crisp apple.
[07:18.280 --> 07:20.200]  Knew it. I knew it. Crunchy food.
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.940]  That has to be one of the most dangerous foods in a quiet place.
[07:23.020 --> 07:23.920]  You would think.
[07:24.160 --> 07:26.040]  But there's only one way to find out.
[07:27.240 --> 07:28.500]  With the test.
[07:28.500 --> 07:29.160]  Good luck.
[07:46.480 --> 07:47.800]  I think he's safe.
[07:48.540 --> 07:49.540]  Getting away with it.
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.880]  Yeah, until he hits the mute button and it kills him again.
[07:53.420 --> 07:54.460]  He's swallowing, I think.
[08:01.800 --> 08:04.760]  No! He got me again, the mute.
[08:05.320 --> 08:06.260]  Apples are safe.
[08:06.540 --> 08:10.620]  You can enjoy a delicious cosmic crisp apple in a quiet place.
[08:11.520 --> 08:12.720]  No problem with that.
[08:13.860 --> 08:17.160]  Now, when you're having a cosmic crisp apple, you don't need one
[08:17.160 --> 08:18.320]  because they're so juicy.
[08:18.900 --> 08:20.120]  But what about a soda?
[08:20.180 --> 08:23.520]  What if you want to crack open a Coke or some beverage of some kind?
[08:23.900 --> 08:25.420]  Yeah, that's that's important.
[08:25.520 --> 08:26.880]  You want to round out lunch?
[08:27.740 --> 08:27.940]  Yep.
[08:29.100 --> 08:31.040]  Soda test begins now.
[08:43.260 --> 08:44.880]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[08:45.040 --> 08:46.080]  Soda not safe.
[08:46.820 --> 08:48.300]  Soda not safe.
[08:48.660 --> 08:49.820]  I thought you'd already opened it.
[08:50.160 --> 08:50.720]  Yeah, me too.
[08:50.900 --> 08:53.800]  Andrew, here's a question, because I've noticed that this
[08:54.680 --> 08:57.120]  this whole test has been next to some running water.
[08:57.120 --> 09:00.260]  So does that mean running water is inherently safe?
[09:00.340 --> 09:02.860]  And if so, could you get away with just pissing?
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.080]  Oh, yeah, as established in the Quiet Place, I've never seen.
[09:07.300 --> 09:11.000]  They don't they can't differentiate from from sounds of water.
[09:11.180 --> 09:14.000]  Running water is probably the safest thing to be near.
[09:14.080 --> 09:14.600]  That's great.
[09:15.580 --> 09:17.080]  But a library, awful.
[09:17.300 --> 09:20.160]  So if you could train terrible, you could train yourself to just piss
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.100]  as you walk forever, you'd be like you'd be like walking with a waterfall.
[09:24.240 --> 09:25.080]  You'd be safe forever.
[09:25.740 --> 09:27.740]  Now, that would be an elite move. Yeah.
[09:31.160 --> 09:34.120]  Um. Something you might want to do in the apocalypse.
[09:34.660 --> 09:35.880]  Shit, I'm not muted.
[09:38.160 --> 09:42.860]  Oh, this fucking guy again.
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.340]  In a lab environment, it's equivalent to like walking into a gas
[09:47.340 --> 09:48.520]  filled room without a mask.
[09:48.820 --> 09:49.900]  Be like, I thought it again.
[09:50.180 --> 09:51.280]  Oh, my God.
[09:52.180 --> 09:53.560]  This lab is fucked.
[09:53.560 --> 09:56.100]  He's contaminated the experiment again.
[09:56.200 --> 09:56.920]  Thurman again.
[09:57.860 --> 09:59.620]  Yeah, I sneezed it again.
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.640]  OK, we're muted.
[10:03.080 --> 10:03.860]  Everything's fine.
[10:04.060 --> 10:05.220]  No audio. No audio.
[10:05.500 --> 10:06.400]  You might want to.
[10:06.480 --> 10:07.840]  It's one of my favorite snack foods.
[10:08.240 --> 10:09.380]  You might want to make some popcorn.
[10:10.340 --> 10:11.540]  And it could be dangerous environment.
[10:11.620 --> 10:12.720]  You don't know. We'll see.
[10:13.200 --> 10:14.760]  I have an air popper next to me.
[10:14.960 --> 10:17.280]  You're going to pop the popcorn, not just eat.
[10:17.320 --> 10:20.140]  I'm going to pop some popcorn in the Quiet Place.
[10:20.700 --> 10:23.680]  In the Quiet Place, you're going to pop some popcorn.
[10:23.840 --> 10:25.440]  You're like, I'm willing to die for this.
[10:26.280 --> 10:27.740]  Well, let's see, I would.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.560]  I want to see if it works or not.
[10:29.640 --> 10:30.300]  He's on mute now.
[10:30.760 --> 10:32.840]  He's a he's a fucking idiot.
[10:33.220 --> 10:34.860]  He's a he's a moron.
[10:35.100 --> 10:36.480]  I watched him do it.
[10:36.680 --> 10:38.200]  I watched him do it.
[10:48.270 --> 10:49.070]  Good Lord.
[10:50.390 --> 10:53.550]  I didn't think this is what we'd be doing today, but I'm glad we are.
[10:57.130 --> 10:58.190]  Popcorn's no good!
[10:58.770 --> 11:00.130]  Get away from the popcorn!
[11:01.110 --> 11:04.730]  I just want the buttery goodness, you son of a bitch!
[11:06.190 --> 11:06.710]  Fuck!
[11:07.310 --> 11:09.170]  Get away from my popcorn!
[11:09.410 --> 11:13.390]  Is air pop popcorn allowed in the world of the Quiet Place?
[11:13.590 --> 11:16.270]  A question nobody's ever asked.
[11:16.750 --> 11:17.250]  Well, now you know.
[11:17.270 --> 11:18.550]  Now we know, we don't need to ask.
[11:19.070 --> 11:19.570]  Now we know.
[11:19.770 --> 11:20.590]  Did you open a soda?
[11:21.670 --> 11:21.910]  Yeah.
[11:22.390 --> 11:23.630]  But you haven't drank it?
[11:24.310 --> 11:24.470]  No.
[11:24.470 --> 11:29.270]  What if you did a whole can soda chug and tried not to burp in the quiet place?
[11:29.330 --> 11:30.630]  Oh, wow!
[11:31.530 --> 11:32.910]  What a great idea.
[11:33.570 --> 11:35.130]  Get back into the game now.
[11:36.130 --> 11:36.610]  And chug.
[11:37.270 --> 11:38.230]  What a way to go out.
[11:38.530 --> 11:39.730]  You just made the video, Gavin.
[11:43.170 --> 11:45.130]  We'll do the soda chug and then have one more thing.
[11:45.470 --> 11:45.810]  Excellent.
[11:46.850 --> 11:47.830]  I can't get enough of this.
[11:52.050 --> 11:54.330]  Somebody sent us a mail to the P.O. Box today.
[11:55.190 --> 11:57.690]  Somebody sent us a lot of mail to other people at the P.O. Box today.
[11:58.150 --> 11:58.210]  Yeah.
[11:58.250 --> 12:01.370]  I had to have a talk with the fucking mail people about it.
[12:01.650 --> 12:03.230]  But, uh, somebody sent us a...
[12:03.230 --> 12:05.930]  Uh-oh.
[12:10.370 --> 12:11.350]  Somebody sent us a hat.
[12:11.410 --> 12:12.350]  I guess we can all share it.
[12:12.410 --> 12:14.470]  It just says, it's a bad day to be a hot dog.
[12:15.510 --> 12:16.070]  Oh, nice.
[12:16.130 --> 12:17.050]  I think that's for you, buddy.
[12:18.350 --> 12:19.230]  Do you think he's still chugging?
[12:24.330 --> 12:24.710]  No!
[12:25.990 --> 12:27.410]  Did you get the whole thing down?
[12:28.110 --> 12:29.330]  No, I got about halfway.
[12:31.530 --> 12:33.430]  The soda chug is dangerous.
[12:33.610 --> 12:33.930]  Don't...
[12:33.930 --> 12:35.330]  Sip your sodas.
[12:37.830 --> 12:38.710]  Oh, God.
[12:39.190 --> 12:39.570]  Okay.
[12:41.070 --> 12:42.230]  We're gonna advance.
[12:42.690 --> 12:45.450]  We're gonna advance and then we're gonna try something in a minute.
[12:45.770 --> 12:47.070]  Okay, so we are now here.
[12:47.130 --> 12:49.170]  We got a live one in front of us.
[12:49.410 --> 12:52.490]  I turned off the setting for voice thing.
[12:52.490 --> 12:56.250]  We're gonna see how an alien would react to Geoff's farts.
[12:56.470 --> 12:56.750]  Okay.
[12:56.910 --> 13:00.830]  How are you gonna get around waking him on unmuting?
[13:01.170 --> 13:01.910]  I'm gonna be quiet.
[13:02.090 --> 13:02.190]  Okay.
[13:02.190 --> 13:03.070]  That's not...
[13:03.070 --> 13:04.390]  I mean, Gavin, you're right.
[13:05.130 --> 13:06.330]  Just doesn't matter.
[13:06.490 --> 13:07.090]  I've already unmuted.
[13:07.330 --> 13:09.730]  I'm just gonna be quiet once I activate it.
[13:09.910 --> 13:10.130]  Okay.
[13:17.880 --> 13:19.260]  Maybe he can smell it.
[13:33.960 --> 13:37.200]  Looking at him while playing farts is so funny.
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.080]  No!
[13:55.320 --> 13:55.700]  No!
[13:55.960 --> 13:56.360]  Oh, no!
[13:56.360 --> 13:56.480]  No!
[14:01.620 --> 14:04.300]  Well, that is the end of the Regulation Lab.
[14:04.380 --> 14:08.480]  I hope you learned a thing or two about what to do if you are ever in a quiet place scenario.
[14:08.720 --> 14:09.800]  We could do more in the future.
[14:09.940 --> 14:10.160]  Who knows?
[14:10.360 --> 14:11.320]  Maybe the lab will return.
[14:11.720 --> 14:16.480]  If you have any suggestions for what you would like to see tested in the realm of the quiet place, please let us know.
[14:17.020 --> 14:19.560]  Check out our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[14:19.700 --> 14:21.500]  Check out our Patreon.
[14:22.040 --> 14:22.400]  Regulatrion.
[14:22.800 --> 14:23.500]  Regulation Pod.
[14:23.620 --> 14:23.960]  All that.
[14:24.020 --> 14:24.520]  We got videos.
[14:24.520 --> 14:25.320]  We got podcasts.
[14:25.680 --> 14:26.480]  All that good stuff.
[14:26.660 --> 14:28.440]  Thank you guys so much for joining me in the lab.
[14:28.940 --> 14:29.800]  Until next time.
[14:31.400 --> 14:31.760]  Bye.
[14:32.060 --> 14:32.400]  Bye.
