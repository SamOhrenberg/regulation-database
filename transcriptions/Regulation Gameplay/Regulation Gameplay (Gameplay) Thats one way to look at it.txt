[00:00.000 --> 00:02.380]  Why are we driving into oncoming traffic?
[00:02.780 --> 00:03.680]  It shouldn't be in my way.
[00:03.920 --> 00:05.400]  We got trash to deliver.
[00:06.660 --> 00:08.760]  We have trash to deliver.
[00:08.760 --> 00:10.100]  We gotta deliver it to the city.
[00:10.660 --> 00:13.600]  What do you think the trash guy does?
[00:13.600 --> 00:15.140]  Do you think they just pick it up and keep it?
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.320]  They deliver it to the landfill.
[00:16.740 --> 00:18.740]  He brings the trash.
[00:18.780 --> 00:21.580]  He brings the landfill trash.
[00:22.200 --> 00:23.240]  That's who employs the trash man.
[00:23.260 --> 00:26.180]  The way you look at it is that they're not picking up trash from you.
[00:26.480 --> 00:27.700]  It's that they're delivering trash.
[00:27.700 --> 00:29.560]  They're taking the trash to the landfill.
[00:29.560 --> 00:30.200]  They're delivering.
