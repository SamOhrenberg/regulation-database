[00:23.510 --> 00:25.810]  I don't know, where are we going this time, fellers?
[00:27.270 --> 00:28.190]  Onward to adventure.
[00:28.870 --> 00:29.190]  Whoo.
[00:29.310 --> 00:29.950]  Happy Friday.
[00:31.390 --> 00:31.830]  Friday.
[00:32.530 --> 00:33.130]  That's right.
[00:33.170 --> 00:33.450]  It is.
[00:33.510 --> 00:34.630]  It's the best day of the week.
[00:35.290 --> 00:35.810]  It is.
[00:37.710 --> 00:38.410]  Boom, baby.
[00:38.610 --> 00:39.370]  It's gonna be 5-0-1, Leah.
[00:39.850 --> 00:40.750]  It will be.
[00:41.370 --> 00:41.850]  Great point.
[00:43.170 --> 00:45.030]  The passage of time, how convenient.
[00:45.650 --> 00:49.970]  And when it's 5-0-1, it'll be 59 minutes until game three of the Stealthics Magic.
[00:50.390 --> 00:50.770]  Ooh.
[00:51.210 --> 00:53.610]  What's the series at?
[00:54.070 --> 00:55.010]  2-0, come on.
[00:55.790 --> 00:55.990]  Yeah.
[00:56.430 --> 00:58.010]  I don't think I figured, but come on.
[00:58.010 --> 00:58.090]  Yeah.
[00:58.350 --> 01:00.450]  Tatum didn't even play game two and we still...
[01:00.450 --> 01:00.810]  Hey, okay.
[01:01.050 --> 01:01.530]  That's great.
[01:01.590 --> 01:01.890]  Damn.
[01:03.510 --> 01:03.810]  Oh!
[01:06.410 --> 01:07.250]  Headman Manor.
[01:07.430 --> 01:07.950]  Headman Manor.
[01:08.630 --> 01:08.750]  Okay.
[01:09.790 --> 01:11.090]  That's what they call me.
[01:11.670 --> 01:13.550]  They call me Headman.
[01:16.630 --> 01:18.370]  And I got explicit reason.
[01:19.030 --> 01:19.410]  Oh yeah?
[01:19.670 --> 01:20.170]  New talent?
[01:22.810 --> 01:23.570]  Nothing here.
[01:23.950 --> 01:24.110]  Hey.
[01:25.110 --> 01:25.710]  Push me.
[01:25.990 --> 01:26.370]  I am.
[01:26.910 --> 01:27.510]  Oh, shrink up.
[01:27.910 --> 01:28.290]  There you go.
[01:28.430 --> 01:28.590]  Look.
[01:30.170 --> 01:30.850]  Let me look at you.
[01:31.190 --> 01:31.390]  Pop.
[01:32.690 --> 01:33.330]  Pop, pop.
[01:33.410 --> 01:33.790]  Push baby.
[01:33.790 --> 01:35.170]  Oh, I hate this.
[01:36.490 --> 01:38.130]  Arthur, is that you?
[01:42.590 --> 01:42.910]  No!
[01:47.080 --> 01:50.300]  That was a $6,000 face.
[01:51.180 --> 01:52.620]  All right, let's go.
[01:52.720 --> 01:53.060]  Help me.
[01:53.500 --> 01:54.040]  Let's get it.
[01:54.920 --> 01:55.580]  I'm trying.
[01:57.320 --> 01:59.100]  It's a $19,000 harp.
[02:06.820 --> 02:08.800]  It's so funny to hear the explanation later.
[02:09.620 --> 02:10.020]  Oh!
[02:10.840 --> 02:11.180]  Lift.
[02:11.260 --> 02:11.560]  Lift.
[02:11.720 --> 02:12.020]  Lift.
[02:12.100 --> 02:13.000]  Lift with your legs.
[02:14.720 --> 02:15.240]  We're trying.
[02:15.260 --> 02:16.160]  We don't have health insurance.
[02:16.260 --> 02:17.460]  We can't afford to do our backs.
[02:17.620 --> 02:17.900]  Soon.
[02:20.540 --> 02:25.520]  Oh, this is maybe we got to lay across the top.
[02:26.600 --> 02:28.800]  I think we can angle it a little bit here.
[02:28.940 --> 02:29.100]  Yeah.
[02:29.300 --> 02:31.520]  There we go.
[02:32.880 --> 02:33.520]  You got it.
[02:34.180 --> 02:34.580]  Nope.
[02:36.500 --> 02:38.740]  Well, you said there we go, but I didn't see anything change.
[02:39.500 --> 02:42.740]  Why don't you just take it over to the...
[02:42.740 --> 02:45.400]  I mean, do you think it's easier to carry it over there or put it in the car?
[02:45.520 --> 02:46.640]  Yeah, probably. We're this close.
[02:47.380 --> 02:47.700]  Ow!
[02:48.980 --> 02:49.800]  What the hell was that?
[02:49.860 --> 02:50.740]  What happened to us?
[02:51.300 --> 02:52.500]  Who fucking killed me?
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.360]  Did the man come in?
[02:53.360 --> 02:54.440]  It's a fucking clown!
[02:54.680 --> 02:56.180]  A testicle monster came in.
[03:00.190 --> 03:01.730]  Well, he could have warned us at least.
[03:01.890 --> 03:02.950]  God, we were only in the first room.
[03:03.030 --> 03:03.950]  I didn't even see it.
[03:04.050 --> 03:05.830]  Oh, Andrew's right looking at it.
[03:06.750 --> 03:07.230]  God.
[03:11.460 --> 03:11.940]  Andrew.
[03:12.080 --> 03:12.820]  Everyone's dead.
[03:13.180 --> 03:15.080]  You were hiding and then you stood up in front of it.
[03:16.260 --> 03:18.480]  I forgot what button was crouch.
[03:18.840 --> 03:19.860]  I'm playing on the controller.
[03:20.640 --> 03:21.460]  Is it Q?
[03:22.280 --> 03:24.280]  I think it's Q, but...
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.280]  You're on a controller.
[03:25.440 --> 03:27.040]  Shift is also... Oh, the controller.
[03:28.360 --> 03:31.440]  That was the craziest dodge I've ever seen.
[03:31.900 --> 03:32.800]  That was incredible.
[03:35.240 --> 03:36.520]  Oh, Nick's about to get...
[03:37.380 --> 03:38.300]  Oh, that's it.
[03:38.360 --> 03:38.960]  It's over.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.320]  I didn't think he was going to shoot me.
[03:43.200 --> 03:44.460]  I thought he was shooting over me.
[03:44.620 --> 03:44.880]  Damn.
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.260]  All right.
[03:46.300 --> 03:47.280]  Well, that's the end of that run.
[03:48.440 --> 03:48.800]  Wow.
[03:49.020 --> 03:49.380]  Shit.
[03:50.200 --> 03:51.040]  Things are going so...
[03:51.040 --> 03:51.260]  Can we...
[03:51.900 --> 03:53.140]  Yeah, that's tough.
[03:53.240 --> 03:54.980]  You were kind of just moseying in front of it there.
[03:56.120 --> 03:58.620]  Yeah, I thought it was shooting over me and then it wasn't.
[03:58.680 --> 03:59.220]  What is this?
[03:59.340 --> 03:59.840]  It did it first.
[03:59.860 --> 04:00.420]  Here you go, losers.
[04:00.620 --> 04:00.800]  Fight.
[04:00.960 --> 04:01.160]  Fight.
[04:01.340 --> 04:01.560]  Fight.
[04:01.800 --> 04:02.060]  Fight.
[04:02.060 --> 04:02.820]  What?
[04:06.940 --> 04:07.460]  Ow.
[04:07.600 --> 04:08.220]  Son of a bitch.
[04:08.800 --> 04:09.140]  Ow.
[04:09.140 --> 04:10.360]  You just told me to fight.
[04:10.740 --> 04:11.440]  I don't know.
[04:11.660 --> 04:12.240]  I don't know what's happening.
[04:16.150 --> 04:16.670]  Oh.
[04:17.250 --> 04:18.730]  Andrew just bunts.
[04:18.790 --> 04:19.490]  Oh, shit.
[04:19.570 --> 04:20.090]  Oh, God.
[04:20.190 --> 04:21.290]  I was told to fight.
[04:22.410 --> 04:23.130]  You're fighting.
[04:23.750 --> 04:24.450]  He's fighting.
[04:25.610 --> 04:26.130]  Give me this.
[04:27.530 --> 04:28.110]  Get away.
[04:28.390 --> 04:29.810]  Blown senseless.
[04:30.210 --> 04:30.410]  Ah.
[04:31.290 --> 04:31.830]  Mid-hammer.
[04:32.450 --> 04:32.850]  Uh-oh.
[04:33.390 --> 04:33.850]  Uh-oh.
[04:35.770 --> 04:37.210]  I'll whack you with Nick's head.
[04:38.430 --> 04:38.830]  Bye.
[04:44.040 --> 04:44.440]  Ow.
[04:44.780 --> 04:46.060]  Did Eric just kill himself?
[04:46.480 --> 04:47.460]  No, I got whacked.
[04:47.940 --> 04:48.540]  Oh, okay.
[04:49.280 --> 04:49.740]  Get out of here.
[04:52.480 --> 04:54.340]  Geoff's trying to put a duck up Andrew's ass.
[04:54.440 --> 04:54.700]  Get back.
[04:55.100 --> 04:55.580]  Get back.
[04:56.660 --> 04:57.260]  Get back.
[04:57.280 --> 04:57.480]  Come here.
[04:57.760 --> 04:58.660]  I'm going to quack you.
[04:59.180 --> 04:59.460]  Get back.
[05:00.480 --> 05:01.480]  I don't want quacks.
[05:01.820 --> 05:02.560]  Get back, Andrew.
[05:02.980 --> 05:03.300]  Oh, my God.
[05:05.200 --> 05:05.880]  Pick him up.
[05:05.900 --> 05:06.460]  Pick up baby.
[05:10.140 --> 05:10.680]  Uh-oh.
[05:10.940 --> 05:11.440]  They better hurry.
[05:12.180 --> 05:12.860]  Uh-oh.
[05:13.780 --> 05:14.380]  Pick him up.
[05:14.520 --> 05:14.700]  Pick him up.
[05:15.100 --> 05:15.940]  Pick him up.
[05:16.280 --> 05:17.180]  Throw him to his death.
[05:17.980 --> 05:18.000]  Oh.
[05:18.380 --> 05:19.720]  Just slamming him with a book.
[05:19.920 --> 05:20.880]  There's nothing to grab.
[05:21.020 --> 05:21.680]  You're the only one.
[05:21.740 --> 05:21.900]  Oh.
[05:23.880 --> 05:24.540]  Pick him up.
[05:24.600 --> 05:25.160]  Throw him, Geoff.
[05:25.280 --> 05:25.920]  Throw him.
[05:26.860 --> 05:27.920]  Give me the bag.
[05:28.840 --> 05:29.260]  Uh-oh.
[05:29.620 --> 05:30.140]  Geoff's toes.
[05:30.300 --> 05:30.400]  Get away.
[05:30.700 --> 05:30.920]  Get away.
[05:30.920 --> 05:31.200]  Oh.
[05:31.420 --> 05:32.120]  He hit himself.
[05:32.260 --> 05:32.680]  He hit himself.
[05:36.980 --> 05:40.360]  I like how Geoff is silently swinging this.
[05:40.680 --> 05:41.660]  He's locked in.
[05:41.720 --> 05:42.240]  He's focused.
[05:42.760 --> 05:43.380]  He's focused.
[05:44.100 --> 05:45.260]  He's concentrating real good.
[05:45.360 --> 05:45.560]  Uh-oh.
[05:45.600 --> 05:46.340]  Uh-oh.
[05:46.860 --> 05:47.300]  Uh-oh.
[05:47.500 --> 05:47.540]  Oh, shit.
[05:48.200 --> 05:48.400]  No.
[05:53.260 --> 05:54.260]  Oh, man.
[05:55.060 --> 05:55.440]  All right.
[05:55.440 --> 05:58.580]  Geoff is silently bonking Andrew with ducks and books.
[06:01.580 --> 06:02.640]  Oh, my God.
[06:03.860 --> 06:06.700]  Yeah, it's good to know the clown is fucking dangerous.
[06:06.900 --> 06:07.560]  Let's do it again.
[06:07.700 --> 06:08.260]  Let's keep going.
[06:08.380 --> 06:08.800]  I'm ready.
[06:09.180 --> 06:09.940]  I'm locked in.
[06:10.260 --> 06:12.520]  Didn't 2016 teach you anything about clowns?
[06:12.720 --> 06:13.240]  Oh, yeah.
[06:13.260 --> 06:14.180]  I forgot about that.
[06:14.700 --> 06:16.620]  I was waiting 30 years for clowns.
[06:16.740 --> 06:17.080]  I was.
[06:18.360 --> 06:18.760]  Oh.
[06:19.120 --> 06:19.960]  That sounded horrifying.
[06:19.960 --> 06:21.340]  What kind of monster was that?
[06:21.360 --> 06:22.760]  There must be a monster in here, guys.
[06:24.540 --> 06:26.260]  The headband is here or whatever.
[06:27.320 --> 06:28.140]  Let's do something.
[06:28.640 --> 06:28.820]  Okay.
[06:30.200 --> 06:31.160]  Nothing here.
[06:31.620 --> 06:32.400]  Here you go.
[06:34.420 --> 06:35.840]  Oh, a champagne bottle.
[06:36.780 --> 06:37.180]  Nice.
[06:37.460 --> 06:38.200]  Be careful with it.
[06:38.360 --> 06:38.740]  I will be.
[06:39.380 --> 06:41.780]  I saw how Gavin treated it that first time.
[06:44.580 --> 06:45.500]  Keep it nice.
[06:45.920 --> 06:46.520]  Very good.
[06:47.800 --> 06:48.280]  Nice.
[06:49.100 --> 06:49.660]  Oh, is it?
[06:50.400 --> 06:51.980]  It's the bloody shotgun guy.
[06:53.500 --> 06:54.460]  Shotgun man is coming.
[06:55.340 --> 06:56.080]  Be quiet.
[06:56.340 --> 06:56.840]  Just be quiet.
[06:56.960 --> 06:57.340]  We'll be all right.
[07:08.630 --> 07:09.430]  Guys.
[07:10.070 --> 07:11.150]  Something happened.
[07:11.590 --> 07:12.170]  Oh, shit.
[07:14.570 --> 07:15.830]  Do I sound funny?
[07:20.670 --> 07:21.470]  Stop.
[07:22.550 --> 07:24.490]  I don't want to throw up.
[07:24.490 --> 07:25.250]  Oh, my God.
[07:38.480 --> 07:39.280]  Holy shit.
[07:40.020 --> 07:41.620]  That was brutal, dude.
[07:41.660 --> 07:42.460]  That was right next to you.
[07:42.460 --> 07:44.200]  Did Nick throw up and make a noise?
[07:45.420 --> 07:46.560]  Yeah, he threw up.
[07:46.720 --> 07:49.080]  And then I'm covered in his brains now.
[07:50.220 --> 07:52.160]  It got in my pocket a little bit.
[07:52.200 --> 07:53.080]  It's in my mouth.
[07:53.180 --> 07:54.060]  I was hiding over there.
[07:54.060 --> 07:57.020]  And then Nick vommed me over here.
[07:57.180 --> 07:58.760]  He threw up on me and I rolled away.
[08:02.240 --> 08:03.520]  Oh, my God.
[08:03.720 --> 08:04.000]  All right.
[08:04.040 --> 08:04.800]  Stick his head in the back.
[08:04.820 --> 08:05.740]  Grab his head, huh?
[08:06.040 --> 08:06.200]  Yeah.
[08:06.480 --> 08:07.600]  Put it in the box.
[08:07.840 --> 08:08.400]  Is Andrew all right?
[08:09.300 --> 08:09.780]  I don't know.
[08:09.880 --> 08:12.060]  I heard him yell, what's up, blind guy?
[08:18.480 --> 08:18.840]  Andrew.
[08:19.580 --> 08:19.940]  Okay.
[08:20.780 --> 08:22.140]  Now I want you to put it away.
[08:23.920 --> 08:25.500]  Man, being hidden next to the vom guy?
[08:25.860 --> 08:26.480]  That's crazy.
[08:26.800 --> 08:27.160]  Yeah.
[08:28.220 --> 08:28.700]  He's there.
[08:28.700 --> 08:29.700]  He's at the other hole.
[08:33.540 --> 08:34.340]  Do it again.
[08:36.680 --> 08:37.700]  I dare you.
[08:42.920 --> 08:43.880]  Do you think we can beat him up?
[08:44.920 --> 08:46.880]  If I stand behind you and yell?
[08:51.620 --> 08:53.000]  Do we have enough money?
[08:54.580 --> 08:54.900]  Yeah.
[08:55.400 --> 08:55.680]  No.
[08:55.740 --> 08:56.200]  Yeah.
[08:56.860 --> 08:57.920]  We have enough money.
[08:58.340 --> 08:59.440]  Are you going to feed Nick too?
[08:59.900 --> 09:01.760]  I'm going to see if I can hit him with Nick's head.
[09:01.880 --> 09:02.080]  Wow.
[09:04.440 --> 09:05.200]  Do you think it'll work?
[09:06.040 --> 09:06.160]  Yeah.
[09:06.300 --> 09:08.540]  All right, Gavin, you get in there with Nick's head.
[09:10.300 --> 09:10.520]  Okay.
[09:25.830 --> 09:27.530]  You know what?
[09:27.990 --> 09:28.890]  Hey, Andrew.
[09:29.010 --> 09:29.230]  Welcome.
[09:29.530 --> 09:29.970]  Hey, welcome.
[09:30.150 --> 09:32.750]  I hit him with your head and he immediately killed me.
[09:34.110 --> 09:35.850]  At least it's level one.
[09:36.210 --> 09:36.810]  You know what I mean?
[09:36.930 --> 09:37.310]  Yeah.
[09:38.070 --> 09:38.970]  Oh, Gavin.
[09:39.190 --> 09:40.370]  Oh, Gavin's down.
[09:41.670 --> 09:42.510]  Oh, Geoff.
[09:42.670 --> 09:43.430]  It's Geoff.
[09:44.070 --> 09:45.410]  Gavin got me killed.
[09:45.470 --> 09:46.390]  Yeah, he did, dude.
[09:46.430 --> 09:47.230]  He got you killed.
[09:47.370 --> 09:48.010]  He got you killed.
[09:48.010 --> 09:50.350]  You're fucking straight up assassinated.
[09:51.570 --> 09:53.070]  You son of a bitch.
[09:54.290 --> 09:55.730]  I mean, it's just the first level.
[09:55.830 --> 09:57.610]  So I think it was fine to experiment.
[09:57.950 --> 09:59.490]  That was the funniest thing he could have done.
[10:00.030 --> 10:00.930]  Oh my God.
[10:01.510 --> 10:02.450]  I was in the clear.
[10:03.170 --> 10:04.210]  He annihilated you.
[10:04.270 --> 10:04.750]  That was great.
[10:06.070 --> 10:06.950]  Grab my head.
[10:08.990 --> 10:11.310]  We had enough money in the fucking thing, too.
[10:11.710 --> 10:13.150]  Yeah, but we want more money.
[10:13.210 --> 10:14.870]  He doesn't even need to bring our heads.
[10:14.990 --> 10:16.170]  He can just escape with us.
[10:18.070 --> 10:18.830]  Just go.
[10:19.390 --> 10:20.250]  He doesn't know that.
[10:20.930 --> 10:22.790]  And he's going to play silently.
[10:24.170 --> 10:24.330]  Yeah.
[10:25.910 --> 10:26.270]  All right.
[10:26.730 --> 10:27.490]  Let's get some hits.
[10:31.330 --> 10:32.230]  The timing.
[10:33.090 --> 10:33.670]  The explanation.
[10:34.010 --> 10:35.030]  Fucking headshot.
[10:37.270 --> 10:38.150]  There's so many heads.
[10:38.270 --> 10:38.690]  Oh, he's back.
[10:38.690 --> 10:39.790]  I thought my plan was good.
[10:39.950 --> 10:40.790]  I thought...
[10:40.790 --> 10:41.570]  It was a great plan.
[10:41.730 --> 10:42.190]  I thought my plan...
[10:42.190 --> 10:43.210]  I thought my plan...
[10:43.210 --> 10:44.210]  Like, kill him.
[10:44.290 --> 10:45.990]  Like, there's got to be a way to kill this guy, right?
[10:47.730 --> 10:48.930]  We got to be able to whack him.
[10:49.050 --> 10:53.230]  I hit him in the head with your head, and he just immediately turned and shot me.
[10:53.430 --> 10:54.050]  Oh, really?
[10:54.310 --> 10:54.630]  Yeah.
[10:54.870 --> 10:55.050]  Damn.
[10:55.050 --> 10:57.170]  Maybe we're not solid enough to knock him down.
[10:57.370 --> 10:59.070]  Because you can buy bombs and shit.
[10:59.130 --> 10:59.490]  I'm sure they'll kill him.
[10:59.490 --> 11:00.150]  Yeah, exactly.
[11:00.270 --> 11:01.470]  So you must be able to kill him.
[11:01.510 --> 11:02.010]  But I wonder...
[11:02.010 --> 11:03.770]  Like, there's objects that...
[11:03.770 --> 11:05.810]  Like, you know when you get run over by, like, the cart?
[11:05.810 --> 11:06.510]  Yeah.
[11:06.530 --> 11:08.410]  When somebody's, like, running fast or whatever?
[11:08.570 --> 11:09.930]  I wonder if that's something we can do.
[11:10.230 --> 11:10.730]  I wonder if...
[11:10.730 --> 11:14.110]  Like, Denzel Washington and Equalizer 3.
[11:14.970 --> 11:16.110]  Exactly like that.
[11:16.210 --> 11:16.550]  Yeah.
[11:16.870 --> 11:17.130]  Yeah.
[11:17.210 --> 11:17.650]  Yeah.
[11:17.870 --> 11:18.590]  I know what you mean.
[11:20.510 --> 11:21.670]  Gavin, you're our one hope.
[11:23.610 --> 11:26.030]  So we don't have to recover everyone's heads?
[11:27.250 --> 11:27.690]  Not...
[11:27.690 --> 11:32.710]  If it's a one station stop, and you have all the money you need,
[11:33.150 --> 11:34.910]  it's going to end when he goes back to the ship anyway.
[11:34.910 --> 11:36.470]  So he doesn't need to bring us back.
[11:36.630 --> 11:37.290]  Oh, he's done!
[11:37.470 --> 11:38.310]  Oh, he's done!
[11:39.130 --> 11:40.270]  How did he live?
[11:44.170 --> 11:44.650]  Wow.
[11:45.090 --> 11:46.370]  How did that happen?
[11:48.210 --> 11:48.690]  No!
[11:53.370 --> 11:55.030]  Such a good shot.
[11:55.850 --> 11:57.490]  Such a good shot of that.
[11:57.690 --> 11:58.650]  Oh my god.
[11:59.990 --> 12:00.710]  What the hell?
[12:00.930 --> 12:03.410]  Oh no, Gavin, no!
[12:04.070 --> 12:04.550]  Gavin.
[12:06.370 --> 12:07.050]  No!
[12:11.070 --> 12:16.510]  Run! Run!
[12:21.350 --> 12:23.370]  He's going to turn to stealth vomit.
[12:24.090 --> 12:24.370]  Oh.
[12:24.730 --> 12:25.950]  Oh my god.
[12:29.170 --> 12:29.870]  No!
[12:31.190 --> 12:32.170]  Oh, Gavin.
[12:32.710 --> 12:33.510]  Oh, Gavin.
[12:33.790 --> 12:35.070]  That was one hell of a run, Gavin.
[12:35.070 --> 12:36.250]  Yeah, Gavin.
[12:36.730 --> 12:37.410]  You tried, buddy.
[12:37.530 --> 12:37.830]  You tried.
[12:41.030 --> 12:41.590]  God.
[12:41.870 --> 12:43.030]  He kept coming back.
[12:43.990 --> 12:46.190]  Dude, on the first area, I think we stuck.
[12:46.490 --> 12:48.690]  Gavin, you got me fucking straight up assassinated.
[12:48.690 --> 12:49.550]  Oh no!
[12:50.450 --> 12:51.410]  Not this again.
[12:52.390 --> 12:54.390]  I still find you a disemboweled prick.
[12:55.570 --> 12:56.690]  Yeah, I was there.
[13:00.270 --> 13:02.970]  Gavin just dodged himself off the platform.
[13:08.140 --> 13:08.700]  No!
[13:09.080 --> 13:09.440]  No!
[13:09.860 --> 13:11.040]  How did I die?
[13:11.820 --> 13:12.420]  Get back!
[13:12.820 --> 13:13.980]  I got a fucking gun!
[13:14.260 --> 13:15.760]  I got a fucking gun!
[13:15.980 --> 13:17.000]  Get away from me!
[13:19.580 --> 13:21.120]  I'll fucking shoot you!
[13:23.040 --> 13:25.240]  No! No! No! No! No!
[13:26.100 --> 13:26.660]  No!
[13:27.620 --> 13:28.300]  I'm out of bullets!
[13:28.580 --> 13:29.180]  I'm out of bullets!
[13:30.920 --> 13:31.360]  Guitar!
[13:33.420 --> 13:33.860]  Dah!
[13:34.280 --> 13:34.560]  Dah!
[13:36.160 --> 13:36.720]  Dah!
[13:40.900 --> 13:41.880]  What is happening?
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.160]  Oh, I've broken my face.
[13:43.920 --> 13:44.580]  What's this?
[13:47.320 --> 13:48.080]  Holy shit!
[13:48.800 --> 13:49.180]  No!
[13:54.020 --> 13:54.980]  Everyone's a loser.
[13:55.580 --> 13:55.940]  I don't know.
[13:56.260 --> 13:57.160]  Oh my god.
[13:57.460 --> 13:58.360]  Oh, that's really funny.
[13:58.940 --> 13:59.640]  Alright, this is the one.
[14:00.300 --> 14:01.000]  Yeah, this is it.
[14:01.040 --> 14:01.800]  I feel good about this.
[14:01.880 --> 14:02.880]  I was doing an exper-
[14:04.340 --> 14:05.980]  There's gotta be a way to kill these guys.
[14:06.380 --> 14:07.200]  There has to be.
[14:07.980 --> 14:09.160]  Well, sometimes-
[14:12.860 --> 14:14.260]  That's what I thought-
[14:14.260 --> 14:18.060]  I think that's what I was trying to do with Nick's head was fucking whack him around.
[14:23.280 --> 14:23.720]  Ooh!
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.020]  When there's locks on these, can you break those locks or no?
[14:29.380 --> 14:29.620]  You know?
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.640]  You got a strong head game, Nick?
[14:35.900 --> 14:38.020]  You got a strong head game or what?
[14:41.880 --> 14:42.980]  He got it.
[14:43.600 --> 14:44.200]  We got a duck.
[14:44.380 --> 14:45.620]  We got a duck situation.
[14:45.980 --> 14:47.220]  We got a duck situation.
[14:47.820 --> 14:48.760]  We got a little duck.
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.200]  Oh, he can jump too!
[15:04.880 --> 15:05.360]  Come here.
[15:05.420 --> 15:06.180]  Come here, you little idiot.
[15:06.580 --> 15:06.880]  There you go.
[15:07.540 --> 15:08.360]  Oh, he's almost in.
[15:08.660 --> 15:09.500]  Make him jump.
[15:09.720 --> 15:10.040]  There you go.
[15:10.180 --> 15:10.420]  Come on.
[15:10.580 --> 15:11.340]  Move back a little, Andrew.
[15:11.820 --> 15:12.860]  I'm gonna put that door up.
[15:13.380 --> 15:13.740]  There you go.
[15:14.060 --> 15:14.720]  Okay, look out, look out.
[15:15.180 --> 15:15.480]  Oh, no.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.040]  Oh, damn it!
[15:17.920 --> 15:18.980]  I think you moved too far away.
[15:19.120 --> 15:19.860]  Maybe we have to wait right by him.
[15:20.160 --> 15:20.340]  Yeah.
[15:20.440 --> 15:21.180]  Andrew, you gotta-
[15:21.180 --> 15:22.200]  Andrew, he's attached to you.
[15:22.260 --> 15:23.440]  Make him go in there and stay with him.
[15:26.180 --> 15:26.800]  There you go.
[15:27.640 --> 15:28.440]  How are we doing for money?
[15:28.520 --> 15:29.160]  Stay right there, stay right there.
[15:29.260 --> 15:30.140]  Do we want to go?
[15:30.540 --> 15:30.760]  No.
[15:31.180 --> 15:31.660]  I want more.
[15:31.760 --> 15:32.200]  I don't like this.
[15:32.600 --> 15:33.260]  You did it.
[15:33.260 --> 15:33.500]  Okay.
[15:34.300 --> 15:35.160]  Did he die?
[15:35.940 --> 15:36.120]  Yeah.
[15:36.360 --> 15:37.320]  I think he's still over here.
[15:37.380 --> 15:37.900]  No, he's here.
[15:38.340 --> 15:38.720]  Oh, is he?
[15:38.740 --> 15:39.200]  He's on the floor.
[15:39.340 --> 15:40.140]  He's writhing.
[15:40.780 --> 15:41.280]  Pick him up.
[15:41.340 --> 15:41.660]  Smash him.
[15:42.620 --> 15:44.600]  I don't know if I should pick him up because he might eat me.
[15:44.860 --> 15:45.720]  Oh, is that what he does?
[15:45.940 --> 15:46.540]  Is that, like, his deal?
[15:46.980 --> 15:48.760]  I think once you touch him, he goes ape.
[15:53.880 --> 15:54.640]  Who is it?
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  It's the scarecrow thingy.
[16:03.170 --> 16:04.110]  Jesus Christ, man!
[16:04.110 --> 16:05.350]  God damn it.
[16:05.410 --> 16:05.570]  What is happening?
[16:06.070 --> 16:06.190]  We're gonna die!
[16:06.190 --> 16:07.310]  I think somebody touched the duck.
[16:20.440 --> 16:20.920]  Yeah.
[16:22.260 --> 16:23.020]  Yeah, I'm good.
[16:23.980 --> 16:24.660]  Anyone dead?
[16:25.140 --> 16:25.460]  Yeah.
[16:25.880 --> 16:26.380]  One person.
[16:26.600 --> 16:26.820]  Oh, Gavin.
[16:27.380 --> 16:28.640]  Looks like Gavin's dead.
[16:28.880 --> 16:29.040]  Yep.
[16:29.800 --> 16:30.280]  Okay.
[16:34.280 --> 16:36.200]  The scarecrow beat our shit up.
[16:36.360 --> 16:37.120]  Bad style.
[16:37.260 --> 16:38.040]  Oh, Jack, you made it.
[16:38.380 --> 16:38.960]  Yeah, of course.
[16:39.480 --> 16:40.640]  What was the scare Gavin didn't?
[16:41.300 --> 16:42.680]  Oh, that doesn't surprise me.
[16:45.200 --> 16:46.420]  There's a scarecrow right there.
[16:48.460 --> 16:49.840]  She's right here.
[17:01.480 --> 17:02.560]  I got a diamond.
[17:03.380 --> 17:04.040]  Oh, nice.
[17:04.240 --> 17:04.740]  Yeah, be careful.
[17:04.860 --> 17:05.920]  Those will break real fast.
[17:06.260 --> 17:07.560]  Not that that happened to me a little bit earlier.
[17:07.960 --> 17:08.400]  There's bad.
[17:08.480 --> 17:09.420]  There's bad behind us, Geoff.
[17:09.460 --> 17:10.180]  Geoff, there's bad.
[17:10.300 --> 17:11.300]  You don't want to hide.
[17:19.520 --> 17:21.440]  Sometimes we pick up those buzz saws and stuff.
[17:22.320 --> 17:24.200]  And I think we can use those as weapons against them.
[17:24.320 --> 17:26.280]  I don't know if it actually kills them, but it disables them.
[17:27.000 --> 17:27.220]  Okay.
[17:29.220 --> 17:30.200]  It's like a scarecrow.
[17:30.200 --> 17:31.300]  I don't know how it works.
[17:33.640 --> 17:35.420]  Do you know what pisses off the scarecrow?
[17:37.460 --> 17:37.820]  What?
[17:38.360 --> 17:38.700]  Fire?
[17:39.120 --> 17:40.440]  I have no idea.
[17:40.620 --> 17:41.000]  I don't know.
[17:41.240 --> 17:42.280]  Like, what triggers it?
[17:42.360 --> 17:43.660]  I'm not a fucking...
[17:43.660 --> 17:44.460]  This isn't the Riddler.
[17:45.980 --> 17:46.900]  I don't know, man.
[17:51.820 --> 17:53.780]  Listen, we might be stuck in this room for a while.
[17:53.840 --> 17:54.740]  Why don't you tell me a riddle?
[17:57.020 --> 17:57.740]  Entertain me.
[17:58.220 --> 17:59.260]  I'm getting out of here.
[18:02.400 --> 18:04.400]  Didn't seem like there was shit over here anyway.
[18:05.320 --> 18:05.920]  Oh, hey.
[18:06.380 --> 18:07.420]  Hey, what's up?
[18:07.540 --> 18:08.360]  She went this way.
[18:08.740 --> 18:09.500]  She went this way.
[18:09.680 --> 18:10.360]  We have...
[18:10.360 --> 18:11.060]  She went this way.
[18:11.200 --> 18:12.220]  But we have enough.
[18:12.620 --> 18:13.520]  Do you guys just want to beat it?
[18:13.820 --> 18:14.760]  Yeah, let's just beat it.
[18:15.360 --> 18:16.600]  Let's just jack it right off.
[18:17.140 --> 18:17.800]  Okay, let's go.
[18:19.700 --> 18:21.280]  Do we know what alerts the scarecrow?
[18:21.960 --> 18:22.420]  Come on.
[18:22.580 --> 18:23.220]  They're over here.
[18:24.300 --> 18:25.140]  I think we're good.
[18:25.400 --> 18:25.980]  Guys, let's...
[18:25.980 --> 18:26.620]  Guys, let's hit it.
[18:26.900 --> 18:27.280]  Where'd you go?
[18:27.360 --> 18:28.480]  We got more than enough.
[18:28.620 --> 18:29.560]  They went over here, I think.
[18:31.960 --> 18:32.460]  Get away.
[18:32.560 --> 18:32.800]  Yeah.
[18:33.880 --> 18:34.240]  No!
[18:35.620 --> 18:36.360]  Didn't like that.
[18:36.460 --> 18:36.920]  Didn't like that.
[18:37.060 --> 18:37.520]  Didn't like that.
[18:37.620 --> 18:38.180]  Didn't like that.
[18:40.300 --> 18:40.900]  Oh, fuck.
[18:40.960 --> 18:41.320]  We're not.
[18:46.760 --> 18:47.500]  Are you going to hit her?
[18:47.640 --> 18:47.920]  Hit her.
[18:49.540 --> 18:51.040]  I'll collect your head if you fail.
[18:52.020 --> 18:52.460]  Thanks, man.
[18:52.680 --> 18:53.080]  Hey, man.
[18:53.240 --> 18:54.440]  I got your back.
[18:56.560 --> 18:57.220]  I want it to.
[18:58.760 --> 19:00.180]  Oh, like a distraction.
[19:03.320 --> 19:04.040]  E doesn't...
[19:04.640 --> 19:04.960]  No.
[19:05.120 --> 19:06.600]  I think you just have to shake it.
[19:07.020 --> 19:07.240]  Oh, yeah?
[19:08.300 --> 19:08.660]  I think so.
[19:08.660 --> 19:10.560]  All right, I'm going to come back to you guys now.
[19:15.280 --> 19:16.440]  I found a chest.
[19:16.940 --> 19:18.060]  It has a lock on it.
[19:18.840 --> 19:19.640]  Do you have a key?
[19:20.340 --> 19:20.660]  No.
[19:21.080 --> 19:21.860]  Could be a problem.
[19:22.420 --> 19:22.980]  It could be.
[19:23.020 --> 19:23.300]  Let's go.
[19:23.440 --> 19:23.860]  Let's just go.
[19:24.100 --> 19:24.560]  Let's beat it.
[19:25.000 --> 19:25.220]  Yeah.
[19:25.220 --> 19:26.220]  Let's get out of here.
[19:27.460 --> 19:28.080]  We're big boys.
[19:28.220 --> 19:28.680]  Let's beat it.
[19:29.160 --> 19:29.620]  Wait a minute.
[19:29.700 --> 19:30.100]  This is the wrong way.
[19:30.180 --> 19:30.420]  Is it?
[19:30.900 --> 19:31.120]  Yeah.
[19:31.340 --> 19:32.300]  Yeah, it's the other way.
[19:38.260 --> 19:38.960]  Time to go.
[19:39.480 --> 19:40.080]  I'm dead.
[19:45.530 --> 19:45.930]  Yeah.
[19:46.370 --> 19:46.930]  What's up?
[19:46.970 --> 19:47.470]  Let's get out of here.
[19:48.570 --> 19:48.970]  Yeah.
[19:51.910 --> 19:52.590]  Yeah, I'm here.
[19:58.610 --> 19:59.210]  What's up?
[19:59.790 --> 20:00.010]  Yeah.
[20:04.310 --> 20:05.730]  I think everybody left.
[20:05.910 --> 20:07.050]  They got me except for Gavin, obviously.
[20:07.550 --> 20:08.890]  But once again, you know.
[20:08.890 --> 20:09.090]  Yeah.
[20:09.790 --> 20:10.190]  Obviously.
[20:10.350 --> 20:10.690]  Obviously.
[20:14.470 --> 20:15.330]  Where to, Andrew?
[20:15.490 --> 20:16.130]  They have enough money.
[20:16.190 --> 20:17.030]  We just got to get out of here.
[20:17.890 --> 20:18.730]  That was brutal.
[20:19.330 --> 20:20.050]  Holy shit.
[20:20.130 --> 20:20.790]  We're almost there.
[20:22.230 --> 20:22.590]  Hurry.
[20:23.150 --> 20:23.590]  Here we go.
[20:23.990 --> 20:24.470]  It's done.
[20:24.630 --> 20:25.510]  I think you're going to miss it.
[20:25.610 --> 20:26.170]  Okay, here we go.
[20:29.910 --> 20:30.650]  We did it.
[20:30.790 --> 20:31.010]  Nice.
[20:31.210 --> 20:31.710]  Oh my god.
[20:32.650 --> 20:33.890]  Wow, that was great work on our part.
[20:34.150 --> 20:35.650]  Jesus, Gavin, welcome back.
[20:36.770 --> 20:38.150]  Dudes, sorry about that.
[20:38.150 --> 20:38.910]  That was brutal, dude.
[20:39.350 --> 20:39.590]  Yeah.
[20:39.630 --> 20:40.270]  I got ducked.
[20:40.370 --> 20:41.150]  The duck came for me.
[20:41.150 --> 20:42.330]  Yeah, that was funny.
[20:42.530 --> 20:42.910]  Oh, did you grab it?
[20:44.270 --> 20:47.110]  No, it just came and shot my face and rolled me out in front of that reefer.
[20:47.110 --> 20:47.390]  Oh, Jesus.
[20:47.830 --> 20:47.990]  Yeah.
[20:49.810 --> 20:50.270]  Brutal.
[20:50.310 --> 20:50.950]  Oh, it's back!
[20:51.210 --> 20:51.730]  Oh, it's back!
[20:56.490 --> 20:58.290]  Go shopping with us.
[21:04.450 --> 21:06.250]  That was true fear.
[21:06.570 --> 21:07.630]  That was horror.
[21:09.330 --> 21:10.330]  Oh, it's back!
[21:13.290 --> 21:14.610]  That was awesome.
[21:16.130 --> 21:16.570]  Stamina...
[21:16.570 --> 21:17.210]  What do we do?
[21:17.310 --> 21:17.950]  What do we do?
[21:18.230 --> 21:18.890]  What do we do?
[21:19.150 --> 21:19.510]  What do we do?
[21:19.570 --> 21:20.610]  I recommend stamina.
[21:20.850 --> 21:21.170]  I like stamina.
[21:21.690 --> 21:22.230]  Throw in stamina.
[21:22.850 --> 21:24.130]  I really want strength.
[21:24.310 --> 21:26.030]  I want to beat these fucking things up.
[21:26.130 --> 21:28.030]  I don't want to be afraid of a monster anymore.
[21:29.810 --> 21:32.030]  Maybe next time we save up for a grenade or something.
[21:32.030 --> 21:32.670]  Explosive mine?
[21:32.850 --> 21:33.010]  Yeah.
[21:33.470 --> 21:34.510]  Nah, I don't think...
[21:34.510 --> 21:37.350]  Like, I really do think that we can, like...
[21:38.050 --> 21:39.370]  I think you just gotta be strong.
[21:41.330 --> 21:41.690]  Strength...
[21:41.690 --> 21:43.190]  Like, you lift heavier stuff.
[21:43.270 --> 21:44.350]  Does that also let you hit harder?
[21:44.790 --> 21:47.190]  I think it's probably hit harder or grab them.
[21:47.290 --> 21:49.410]  Because if you can lift heavier stuff, you can probably lift them, right?
[21:49.990 --> 21:50.230]  Yeah.
[21:50.490 --> 21:53.530]  I'm going to grab a health upgrade.
[21:53.750 --> 21:54.970]  Oh, there's a dead guy in here.
[21:54.970 --> 21:55.570]  Yeah, I saw that.
[21:55.870 --> 21:56.530]  Never noticed.
[21:57.250 --> 22:00.290]  I got a health upgrade and I think we're good.
[22:00.350 --> 22:00.790]  Are we all good?
[22:01.390 --> 22:01.930]  We all square?
[22:01.990 --> 22:02.150]  Yeah.
[22:02.370 --> 22:03.250]  Alright, let's hit it.
[22:03.370 --> 22:03.990]  Somebody hit the button.
[22:05.590 --> 22:06.550]  Hit the button!
[22:06.810 --> 22:07.210]  You got it.
[22:07.750 --> 22:09.310]  And then when we get started...
[22:09.310 --> 22:09.430]  Back to the ship.
[22:09.430 --> 22:14.890]  Yeah, when we get started, we should look at everyone's health and make sure that we can even up a little bit.
[22:14.930 --> 22:17.050]  Because I know Gavin's going to have, like, zero.
[22:18.290 --> 22:18.990]  Okey-doke.
[22:20.970 --> 22:21.550]  Off we go.
[22:25.990 --> 22:27.430]  We learn valuable lessons.
[22:28.970 --> 22:29.690]  Lessons learned.
[22:29.810 --> 22:31.030]  How do I give you some of my health?
[22:31.110 --> 22:33.450]  You grab them by the scruff.
[22:34.730 --> 22:35.070]  Okay.
[22:35.770 --> 22:36.210]  Oh, thanks.
[22:36.970 --> 22:38.250]  Careful, not too much.
[22:38.590 --> 22:39.510]  Gavin, I got you.
[22:39.710 --> 22:39.890]  Here.
[22:39.890 --> 22:41.650]  I got 56.
[22:41.950 --> 22:42.590]  There you go.
[22:43.110 --> 22:43.550]  66.
[22:43.850 --> 22:44.470]  I have 57.
[22:44.630 --> 22:44.810]  Do you?
[22:45.330 --> 22:45.630]  Thanks.
[22:46.110 --> 22:47.410]  I can hit you with a little bit.
[22:47.450 --> 22:47.550]  Here.
[22:48.530 --> 22:48.910]  Oh, sweet.
[22:51.150 --> 22:52.250]  What do you have there, Eric?
[22:52.270 --> 22:52.630]  I got 85.
[22:52.790 --> 22:53.210]  67.
[22:53.470 --> 22:53.830]  That's perfect.
[22:54.030 --> 22:54.430]  I'm at 85.
[22:54.950 --> 22:56.250]  Alright, let's do it.
[22:56.750 --> 22:58.790]  Did the comments tell us what this yellow thing does?
[22:58.890 --> 23:01.670]  It's to recharge weapons like guns and stuff.
[23:02.750 --> 23:04.930]  One day we'll be able to buy one.
[23:06.430 --> 23:07.190]  One day.
[23:07.450 --> 23:08.570]  One day we'll get past level four.
[23:08.570 --> 23:08.730]  One day.
[23:10.490 --> 23:11.930]  We made it there for the first time.
[23:12.870 --> 23:13.230]  Alright.
[23:15.110 --> 23:19.770]  Alright, this is a two-stopper, so this one you can bring heads back and revive us before we go to the next spot.
[23:19.770 --> 23:22.410]  Yes, which we should be mindful of if we can.
[23:22.850 --> 23:23.170]  Yes.
[23:23.610 --> 23:25.350]  On the first stage, it's not so important.
[23:26.110 --> 23:26.950]  Anything cool going on over here?
[23:27.090 --> 23:28.490]  X plus four equals B.
[23:28.810 --> 23:29.590]  Oh, I got that on the fridge.
[23:29.670 --> 23:30.270]  Alright, solve.
[23:30.850 --> 23:31.630]  Okay, well then we're done.
[23:31.650 --> 23:31.850]  Sweet.
[23:32.530 --> 23:32.750]  Soda?
[23:33.430 --> 23:34.270]  Open up, bitch.
[23:38.510 --> 23:39.610]  Oh, what's this?
[23:48.010 --> 23:49.610]  Yeah, yeah, I was trying to get at it.
[23:49.610 --> 23:52.330]  I got something you might like, Eric, as far as fighting the bad guys.
[23:54.010 --> 23:55.890]  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
[23:56.370 --> 23:57.170]  How much is that worth?
[23:57.230 --> 23:57.790]  Eleven thousand.
[23:59.270 --> 23:59.990]  Holy shit.
[24:01.730 --> 24:02.730]  That could get us done.
[24:03.010 --> 24:04.690]  That could get done with our first extract.
[24:04.750 --> 24:06.430]  But, I wonder if we want to wait?
[24:06.710 --> 24:08.690]  If you kill a bad guy, does he respawn eventually?
[24:10.010 --> 24:10.510]  That's what I'm asking.
[24:10.510 --> 24:10.850]  That's what I'm wondering.
[24:11.390 --> 24:12.650]  A duck came back.
[24:13.550 --> 24:14.130]  That's true.
[24:14.430 --> 24:15.930]  Oh, hey, let me lift this up.
[24:15.990 --> 24:18.790]  Somebody grab this, uh, toilet diamond.
[24:20.510 --> 24:21.490]  Oh, there's a toilet diamond?
[24:21.530 --> 24:23.370]  Yeah, I can't get the top to stay up though, so.
[24:23.510 --> 24:23.870]  You got it.
[24:24.050 --> 24:25.110]  I'll get it, I'll get it, I got it.
[24:25.810 --> 24:26.750]  Alright, well.
[24:27.370 --> 24:28.630]  It hit your hand and blew up.
[24:29.010 --> 24:29.810]  Don't put that on!
[24:29.890 --> 24:30.770]  Don't make that my fault!
[24:31.410 --> 24:32.070]  I'm standing fucking still!
[24:32.070 --> 24:33.730]  I mean, I hit your hand and blew it up.
[24:34.310 --> 24:34.670]  Do you want a hat?
[24:35.810 --> 24:37.790]  Yeah, let's go to the extraction with it.
[24:38.130 --> 24:38.790]  Put it in.
[24:38.790 --> 24:39.850]  It's stinky anyway.
[24:40.230 --> 24:43.850]  We can put the whole thing in, that way it's only one giant thing of cash.
[24:44.050 --> 24:44.970]  Is it in the bog?
[24:45.530 --> 24:46.210]  No, it's over here.
[24:46.250 --> 24:46.590]  I don't think so.
[24:46.910 --> 24:47.230]  This way.
[24:49.410 --> 24:51.230]  Oh my god, I don't know where that door goes.
[24:53.210 --> 24:53.730]  Which way?
[24:54.790 --> 24:56.190]  Where I am, over here, fellas.
[24:56.810 --> 24:57.650]  Okay, okay.
[24:58.810 --> 25:01.050]  I don't know how we got lost through one doorhole.
[25:01.370 --> 25:02.390]  Yeah, no, that was impressive.
[25:04.290 --> 25:04.450]  Wow.
[25:08.910 --> 25:10.150]  Eric's gonna be like, what the gun?
[25:11.850 --> 25:13.190]  Is there a second one?
[25:13.770 --> 25:14.070]  Yes.
[25:16.510 --> 25:19.630]  So, we'll snag this and the pile of cash.
[25:22.890 --> 25:24.110]  No, we lost money!
[25:24.650 --> 25:25.010]  Ow!
[25:26.350 --> 25:28.010]  We're losing more money, Gavin!
[25:29.870 --> 25:30.330]  Gavin.
[25:30.750 --> 25:31.210]  Gavin.
[25:32.210 --> 25:32.410]  Yeah?
[25:32.850 --> 25:33.350]  Hold on a sec.
[25:34.030 --> 25:34.770]  We gotta bring the money.
[25:34.930 --> 25:36.570]  Why don't we just leave it in the car?
[25:37.130 --> 25:37.310]  Alright.
[25:39.290 --> 25:39.650]  Yeah.
[25:40.130 --> 25:41.150]  No, I mean the...
[25:41.150 --> 25:41.850]  Can you have the car?
[25:41.850 --> 25:42.370]  No, the...
[25:42.370 --> 25:42.610]  Oh.
[25:42.910 --> 25:44.510]  Well, we need it for the second one.
[25:44.850 --> 25:45.170]  Oh.
[25:46.330 --> 25:47.790]  I assume we would find more items.
[25:49.490 --> 25:49.930]  We'll do both.
[25:51.730 --> 25:52.370]  What happened to Eric?
[25:54.790 --> 25:55.390]  Hey, Eric?
[25:56.110 --> 25:56.470]  Eric?
[25:56.630 --> 25:56.830]  Eric?
[25:57.250 --> 25:57.870]  Hey, man.
[25:58.850 --> 25:59.210]  Andrew?
[25:59.390 --> 25:59.570]  Yeah?
[25:59.770 --> 26:00.370]  We're over here.
[26:01.070 --> 26:01.350]  Okay.
[26:01.450 --> 26:01.990]  Yeah, yeah, we're just...
[26:01.990 --> 26:04.230]  I was just exploring some other rooms and grabbing some stuff.
[26:04.430 --> 26:06.270]  There's stuff on the floor right there if you guys wanna bring...
[26:06.270 --> 26:06.610]  Oh, cool.
[26:06.990 --> 26:07.670]  Bring it over to the car?
[26:08.730 --> 26:09.230]  Cool.
[26:09.730 --> 26:10.290]  Love it.
[26:10.450 --> 26:11.250]  Doing great so far.
[26:11.510 --> 26:12.390]  I think we got it.
[26:13.190 --> 26:13.450]  Ooh!
[26:13.830 --> 26:14.610]  Hey, what's this?
[26:15.670 --> 26:16.110]  A game.
[26:18.510 --> 26:18.870]  Nice.
[26:19.270 --> 26:21.550]  A little test tube.
[26:22.110 --> 26:23.430]  Giant test tube.
[26:24.230 --> 26:24.730]  Alright.
[26:26.070 --> 26:26.570]  Nope.
[26:27.250 --> 26:28.030]  Anything in here?
[26:28.050 --> 26:28.510]  There we go.
[26:28.870 --> 26:29.590]  Uh, little gnomes!
[26:29.790 --> 26:30.230]  Gnomes!
[26:32.870 --> 26:33.370]  Uh...
[26:33.370 --> 26:34.050]  Shut the door.
[26:35.290 --> 26:36.390]  How do you kill the gnome?
[26:36.390 --> 26:36.570]  Smash them.
[26:36.690 --> 26:37.270]  There's a monster.
[26:37.810 --> 26:40.350]  Grab them, and then spin them, and then smash them.
[26:41.270 --> 26:42.470]  Oh, are they little gnomes?
[26:43.050 --> 26:43.230]  Yeah.
[26:43.430 --> 26:43.930]  Spin and smash.
[26:44.450 --> 26:44.870]  Monster!
[26:44.990 --> 26:45.170]  Monster!
[26:45.810 --> 26:46.250]  Monster!
[26:46.550 --> 26:46.950]  Hide!
[26:47.370 --> 26:48.010]  What kind?
[26:48.210 --> 26:48.990]  I don't know.
[26:49.270 --> 26:49.730]  What kind?
[26:50.570 --> 26:51.010]  Weaponry.
[26:55.850 --> 26:56.730]  It's the night.
[27:02.180 --> 27:03.440]  Did you see what it is?
[27:04.500 --> 27:05.500]  Yeah, it's a monster.
[27:10.180 --> 27:11.360]  Oh, fuck me, Simon.
[27:13.940 --> 27:15.560]  You might want to crouch, buddy.
[27:16.180 --> 27:17.000]  That fucking thing.
[27:17.320 --> 27:17.980]  You tell me.
[27:18.260 --> 27:18.500]  In here?
[27:21.560 --> 27:21.920]  Hello?
[27:24.480 --> 27:24.840]  No.
[27:25.440 --> 27:26.660]  You here, you stupid bitch?
[27:27.280 --> 27:28.280]  Alright, calm down.
[27:32.030 --> 27:32.470]  Oh, shit.
[27:35.490 --> 27:36.770]  It's just in the room with us.
[27:36.810 --> 27:37.590]  It does have an eye.
[27:41.540 --> 27:42.540]  You think it knows we're here?
[27:42.600 --> 27:43.700]  Oh, I don't want it to break our shit.
[27:45.420 --> 27:53.230]  Ah, it broke the...
[27:53.230 --> 27:53.490]  Okay.
[27:54.870 --> 27:55.790]  Oh, my God.
[27:59.150 --> 28:00.590]  Hey, fellas, I got an item.
[28:06.650 --> 28:07.370]  Excuse me, sir.
[28:07.890 --> 28:09.290]  Pardon me, I just got to put this in here.
[28:10.190 --> 28:10.630]  Thank you.
[28:12.090 --> 28:12.930]  Oh, someone's dead.
[28:13.870 --> 28:14.730]  Put you in here, too.
[28:16.990 --> 28:17.930]  Yeah, you just...
[28:17.930 --> 28:18.530]  I'm going to...
[28:18.530 --> 28:19.250]  You go that way.
[28:20.330 --> 28:21.670]  Excuse me, I'm just going to close this door.
[28:23.590 --> 28:24.430]  Okay, good luck.
[28:25.310 --> 28:26.910]  Hope you find what you're looking for.
[28:27.870 --> 28:28.710]  Yeah, what's up?
[28:29.090 --> 28:34.390]  He smashed into Nick and the car and did like $18,000 worth of damage and killed Nick.
[28:34.730 --> 28:35.490]  Oh, no!
[28:36.970 --> 28:39.170]  Don't worry, I just added $600 back in.
[28:39.970 --> 28:40.450]  $450!
[28:41.270 --> 28:42.110]  Alright, let's...
[28:42.110 --> 28:43.550]  Is he through this door?
[28:44.970 --> 28:46.150]  Yeah, I closed the door.
[28:46.310 --> 28:46.950]  I let him walk through.
[28:47.630 --> 28:49.590]  I found a propane tank for $3,500.
[28:50.310 --> 28:50.650]  Nice.
[28:51.030 --> 28:51.150]  Nice.
[28:51.590 --> 28:52.230]  Pricey prop.
[28:53.390 --> 28:54.510]  Careful, careful, careful.
[28:54.670 --> 28:55.170]  Oh, God.
[28:56.150 --> 28:56.530]  Okay.
[28:57.330 --> 28:59.130]  Alright, should I bring the car?
[29:01.310 --> 29:03.230]  Yeah, because it's got to be...
[29:04.090 --> 29:04.710]  Hang on.
[29:05.270 --> 29:06.410]  Is the extraction point...
[29:06.410 --> 29:08.130]  Yeah, the extraction point I think is through here.
[29:08.450 --> 29:08.990]  I can't tell.
[29:09.470 --> 29:09.790]  Let me see.
[29:12.050 --> 29:14.410]  Nick got absolutely rinsed.
[29:15.390 --> 29:16.010]  Oh, is he dead?
[29:16.010 --> 29:16.910]  I've never seen anything like it.
[29:16.950 --> 29:18.590]  He got smashed senseless.
[29:18.830 --> 29:18.970]  Hey!
[29:19.110 --> 29:19.190]  Yeah?
[29:19.790 --> 29:21.530]  The extraction point is back here.
[29:23.250 --> 29:24.270]  Is this the one we used?
[29:24.350 --> 29:27.090]  Yeah, this is the one that we used to finish up.
[29:27.970 --> 29:28.350]  We can...
[29:28.350 --> 29:29.430]  How much money are we at?
[29:34.480 --> 29:35.360]  How much are we at?
[29:38.320 --> 29:38.860]  $13,000.
[29:39.860 --> 29:41.000]  I say we call it.
[29:41.160 --> 29:41.960]  I say we just do it.
[29:42.020 --> 29:43.640]  Let's move on to the next level.
[29:43.840 --> 29:44.260]  Yeah, let's do it.
[29:44.340 --> 29:44.440]  Okay.
[29:45.060 --> 29:45.720]  Andrew's got something.
[29:46.480 --> 29:47.380]  It's through here.
[29:48.680 --> 29:50.620]  Andrew's diamond ring doesn't...
[29:51.440 --> 29:51.980]  There it is.
[29:52.860 --> 29:55.580]  So, throw the ring in there and then everyone back up.
[29:55.780 --> 29:56.600]  And then we should be good.
[29:56.660 --> 29:57.980]  And we can make it back to the start.
[29:58.860 --> 29:59.420]  And that'll be it.
[30:00.460 --> 30:01.100]  How's everyone's health?
[30:02.520 --> 30:02.880]  Fantastic.
[30:04.380 --> 30:05.120]  Yeah, pretty good.
[30:05.560 --> 30:07.000]  I'm at 100 if anybody needs health.
[30:07.120 --> 30:07.920]  I am at 51.
[30:08.120 --> 30:10.580]  But Nick is about to come back and he's about to need a lot.
[30:13.580 --> 30:14.540]  Buddy, let me get you.
[30:14.700 --> 30:15.260]  Let me get you.
[30:15.320 --> 30:15.680]  Stand still.
[30:16.240 --> 30:16.460]  Okay.
[30:18.300 --> 30:19.840]  Well, that could have gone better.
[30:20.400 --> 30:20.580]  Yeah.
[30:21.040 --> 30:21.920]  Andrew, how you doing?
[30:22.420 --> 30:22.940]  Thank you, sir.
[30:23.240 --> 30:23.640]  Thank you.
[30:24.080 --> 30:24.480]  Thank you.
[30:25.060 --> 30:26.000]  Thank you.
[30:26.020 --> 30:26.540]  You're a good man.
[30:26.620 --> 30:26.980]  All right.
[30:27.020 --> 30:27.880]  We can leave the cart.
[30:31.280 --> 30:31.800]  All right.
[30:31.860 --> 30:33.320]  We should all ball back.
[30:33.480 --> 30:33.760]  Andrew?
[30:35.420 --> 30:35.700]  No.
[30:37.780 --> 30:38.960]  I fucking yeah.
[30:40.240 --> 30:41.080]  Did you say no?
[30:41.240 --> 30:41.640]  No what?
[30:41.880 --> 30:42.100]  No.
[30:42.640 --> 30:43.080]  Gnome.
[30:43.680 --> 30:44.740]  Oh, I heard no as well.
[30:45.760 --> 30:46.200]  Gnome.
[30:47.380 --> 30:47.820]  Andrew?
[30:48.780 --> 30:49.760]  Where is Andrew?
[30:50.580 --> 30:50.960]  Uh-oh.
[30:51.680 --> 30:52.360]  Creature's in the way.
[30:53.480 --> 30:54.220]  We have to go that way.
[30:54.480 --> 30:55.100]  Oh, he's coming back.
[30:56.220 --> 30:57.580]  He can get you from a distance, by the way.
[31:05.950 --> 31:07.250]  Oh, he got sucked in.
[31:07.410 --> 31:08.090]  He got sucked in.
[31:09.470 --> 31:10.850]  I watched that happen to you before.
[31:13.590 --> 31:14.430]  I lived it.
[31:15.550 --> 31:15.890]  Oh, God.
[31:19.180 --> 31:20.080]  He just killed him.
[31:20.120 --> 31:20.400]  I heard him.
[31:20.700 --> 31:23.060]  He just blitzed there to pieces.
[31:24.360 --> 31:25.120]  Oh, Gavin, look out!
[31:31.760 --> 31:32.960]  Gavin, are you all right?
[31:33.780 --> 31:35.860]  Yeah, I just had to run behind you.
[31:36.240 --> 31:36.700]  Thank you.
[31:37.580 --> 31:38.160]  Fight them!
[31:39.120 --> 31:39.300]  Okay.
[31:42.200 --> 31:43.140]  Is it just us?
[31:43.460 --> 31:44.800]  No, I think Geoff survived.
[31:46.100 --> 31:46.980]  Another gnome.
[31:52.100 --> 31:53.460]  Get out of here, you little...
[31:53.460 --> 31:54.200]  This is so funny.
[31:54.520 --> 31:55.180]  Little son of a bitch.
[31:57.420 --> 31:58.300]  Little bastards.
[31:59.500 --> 32:00.960]  How does this thing detect you?
[32:03.560 --> 32:04.360]  He's throwing...
[32:04.360 --> 32:11.820]  Oh, I got my shit sucked in.
[32:12.700 --> 32:15.860]  Dude, you rolled right into him and he fucking punted you.
[32:16.060 --> 32:17.700]  He sucked me off the top of that thing.
[32:17.800 --> 32:18.140]  Go fuck yourself.
[32:18.740 --> 32:19.540]  Oh, is that what happened?
[32:19.940 --> 32:20.240]  Yeah.
[32:22.280 --> 32:23.380]  That's fucking funny.
[32:25.200 --> 32:27.100]  Eric and Andrew are already at the other end.
[32:27.220 --> 32:27.720]  Oh, they just went.
[32:28.160 --> 32:28.980]  That's not a good sign.
[32:31.420 --> 32:32.540]  Oh, Andrew's got your head.
[32:32.540 --> 32:32.940]  I got his head.
[32:35.080 --> 32:36.320]  How about the other two?
[32:37.020 --> 32:38.000]  I have no idea.
[32:38.360 --> 32:40.480]  I haven't heard them at all, which makes me think they're dead.
[32:42.100 --> 32:42.360]  Gnome!
[32:42.660 --> 32:43.800]  Nick's killing gnomes.
[32:44.360 --> 32:45.480]  Andrew just saw a gnome.
[32:48.260 --> 32:49.500]  Oh no! Oh no!
[32:49.660 --> 32:50.680]  Stamina! Oh no, stamina!
[32:50.960 --> 32:51.120]  No!
[32:52.980 --> 32:53.880]  Nick, are you alive?
[32:56.180 --> 32:57.340]  What happened to you, Nick?
[32:57.340 --> 32:57.940]  I cut his head.
[32:58.060 --> 33:00.000]  I tried to get your head and run back.
[33:01.320 --> 33:02.080]  Didn't make it.
[33:03.000 --> 33:05.180]  Eric was alive. I didn't know he was alive.
[33:08.700 --> 33:11.460]  I heard Nick and then I suddenly didn't hear Nick.
[33:11.560 --> 33:13.700]  There's gnomes over here, but dude, I don't know.
[33:14.900 --> 33:18.120]  Nick had Gavin's head and he ran right into the monster.
[33:19.140 --> 33:20.800]  I came back alive immediately.
[33:21.220 --> 33:22.740]  So Gavin's dead.
[33:22.820 --> 33:23.400]  Yeah, Gavin's dead.
[33:26.600 --> 33:29.760]  Okay, let's just end this thing because I think they're done.
[33:30.860 --> 33:33.860]  If Nick is alive, it's a miracle, but I just don't think he is.
[33:34.280 --> 33:35.040]  More gnomes.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.460]  Yeah, grab them. Grab and smash them.
[33:39.300 --> 33:39.980]  Little bitches.
[33:41.100 --> 33:41.980]  Taking them with us.
[33:42.080 --> 33:43.860]  Fucking bitch. Fucking bitch made gnome.
[33:44.040 --> 33:44.660]  Oh shit.
[33:47.240 --> 33:47.800]  Smash them.
[33:48.480 --> 33:49.740]  I'm going to rehabilitate them.
[33:50.680 --> 33:51.180]  Oh, there's a lock.
[33:51.860 --> 33:54.040]  Yeah, I put it there. I put it there.
[33:55.360 --> 33:56.480]  Alright, should I send it?
[33:57.180 --> 33:57.720]  Yeah, send it.
[33:58.880 --> 33:59.680]  Sorry, Nick.
[34:01.600 --> 34:02.740]  Oh no, gnomes!
[34:03.060 --> 34:04.080]  Gnomes! Gnomes!
[34:06.480 --> 34:07.700]  Nick, were you dead?
[34:08.340 --> 34:09.140]  Oh yeah, I was dead.
[34:09.520 --> 34:12.700]  Okay, okay. I heard you say, oh no, stamina, and then nothing.
[34:14.140 --> 34:17.900]  Well, it was the stamina that undid me because I ran past him with Gavin's head.
[34:18.320 --> 34:21.500]  Yeah, that thing sucks.
[34:22.000 --> 34:22.680]  Yeah, it's tough.
[34:22.820 --> 34:23.240]  It's pretty mean.
[34:23.480 --> 34:25.080]  And it did. It sucked Gavin off the top.
[34:25.080 --> 34:28.080]  Dude, strong head game. Fucking crazy.
[34:28.780 --> 34:29.680]  Got a pistol.
[34:30.020 --> 34:36.700]  Sprint speed, sprint speed, range, stamina, range, health.
[34:41.050 --> 34:42.430]  Ooh, water closet.
[34:44.610 --> 34:45.410]  Anything in here?
[34:46.280 --> 34:46.970]  Let's find out.
[34:47.430 --> 34:48.830]  Humble launch upgrade?
[34:50.130 --> 34:50.630]  No?
[34:51.430 --> 34:51.870]  Nope.
[34:51.870 --> 34:52.390]  Anything in the toilet?
[34:52.930 --> 34:53.190]  No.
[34:53.190 --> 34:53.970]  Shit, no.
[34:55.870 --> 34:56.870]  Let's go grab Gavin.
[34:58.490 --> 34:59.510]  You gonna flush me?
[35:00.770 --> 35:02.830]  Tumble, health. I guess I'll take health.
[35:04.530 --> 35:05.810]  I should probably just get health.
[35:06.110 --> 35:08.470]  Sprint speed. You know what? I'm gonna take sprint speed.
[35:08.690 --> 35:09.690]  I just wanna see what happens.
[35:09.950 --> 35:10.050]  Ooh.
[35:10.290 --> 35:10.950]  Let's see what happens.
[35:11.150 --> 35:11.630]  You go faster?
[35:12.290 --> 35:13.770]  Let's see how much faster it makes you.
[35:14.370 --> 35:15.810]  Sprint speed upgrade.
[35:19.330 --> 35:21.970]  Alright, y'all happy with your purchases?
[35:21.970 --> 35:26.290]  Anything else? We still have 4k that we can spend if anyone wants anything that's cheap.
[35:26.970 --> 35:27.730]  Should I just get another health?
[35:27.930 --> 35:28.250]  Stun grenade.
[35:28.810 --> 35:30.090]  Yeah, get another small health.
[35:30.690 --> 35:31.030]  Is there one?
[35:32.810 --> 35:35.370]  5, 3, 5, 10, 7.
[35:36.410 --> 35:38.010]  Who could afford a stun mine?
[35:38.370 --> 35:40.790]  Can get a shockwave or a stun grenade. You wanna try that?
[35:41.830 --> 35:43.410]  Yeah, we never used them. Let's give it a shot.
[35:43.670 --> 35:45.150]  Okay, I'll grab a stun grenade. Why not?
[35:46.010 --> 35:46.330]  Sweet.
[35:47.670 --> 35:49.050]  Never done weapons before.
[35:50.650 --> 35:51.050]  Okay.
[35:52.830 --> 35:53.830]  We're locked in, baby.
[35:56.250 --> 35:56.650]  Alright.
[35:57.150 --> 35:57.470]  Away!
[35:58.630 --> 36:00.230]  Somebody send it.
[36:02.590 --> 36:03.430]  Somebody's still in the shop.
[36:03.570 --> 36:04.430]  Oh, it's Gavin. He's hanging out.
[36:08.170 --> 36:10.190]  Just wanna make sure we don't leave him behind.
[36:13.070 --> 36:14.730]  Don't know what the consequence is.
[36:16.290 --> 36:16.690]  Okay.
[36:19.070 --> 36:21.090]  Where's that sprint speed? Is that this one?
[36:21.730 --> 36:21.970]  Yeah.
[36:24.610 --> 36:25.450]  And the other one.
[36:25.930 --> 36:27.330]  Yeah, yeah, leave that.
[36:27.610 --> 36:30.170]  And then I think we just start. Let's do it.
[36:30.830 --> 36:31.290]  Let's do it.
[36:32.450 --> 36:33.230]  On the road.
[36:34.310 --> 36:35.330]  On the road again.
[36:36.590 --> 36:38.090]  Let's do a health check when we get in.
[36:38.230 --> 36:39.490]  Can't wait to get sucked by a monster again.
[36:39.970 --> 36:40.570]  Head game.
[36:41.810 --> 36:42.290]  Health check.
[36:43.150 --> 36:44.190]  This game is strong.
[36:46.130 --> 36:47.830]  Suck Gavin's head off the top of the mountain.
[36:47.830 --> 36:48.950]  Fifty-six.
[36:49.970 --> 36:51.030]  I'm at sixteen.
[36:51.730 --> 36:52.430]  Twenty-six.
[36:52.650 --> 36:54.210]  I'm at one.
[36:54.470 --> 36:55.050]  Oh my god.
[36:58.090 --> 37:03.330]  Here, Geoff, I can get you a little bit.
[37:03.750 --> 37:04.430]  Oh, well, thank you.
[37:05.890 --> 37:06.190]  There you go.
[37:06.650 --> 37:07.710]  Was that the gun guy?
[37:09.090 --> 37:09.810]  Where? What gun guy?
[37:10.310 --> 37:11.030]  No, that was...
[37:11.610 --> 37:12.630]  No, it was that opening.
[37:13.350 --> 37:13.590]  Okay.
[37:14.110 --> 37:15.810]  Who wants to push the cart? I can push the cart.
[37:16.010 --> 37:17.250]  I'll push cart.
[37:17.250 --> 37:18.450]  You want it? Okay.
[37:18.710 --> 37:19.750]  Yeah, I don't...
[37:19.750 --> 37:21.650]  I don't want to get shot in the face.
[37:24.510 --> 37:26.090]  Well, until then, you can do some labor.
[37:26.550 --> 37:28.470]  Okay, remember, two...
[37:28.470 --> 37:30.750]  Two extractions, so be mindful of the first.
[37:31.630 --> 37:31.750]  Okay.
[37:37.540 --> 37:38.880]  Oh, also, just before we die...
[37:38.880 --> 37:40.380]  Are you being really cool? Not really.
[37:41.020 --> 37:42.580]  Ow! Ow!
[37:43.200 --> 37:43.740]  That's okay.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  Have you found anything yet?
[37:47.940 --> 37:49.300]  There's nothing in here.
[37:50.260 --> 37:50.660]  Sucks.
[37:51.180 --> 37:51.980]  Oh, a big vase.
[37:52.380 --> 37:53.120]  Should we start with this?
[37:53.240 --> 37:53.320]  Yeah.
[37:54.140 --> 37:54.720]  Oh, that's good.
[37:55.580 --> 37:56.360]  Good find.
[37:58.180 --> 37:59.260]  Nothing here so far.
[37:59.460 --> 37:59.820]  Oh, I hear something.
[38:02.260 --> 38:03.080]  What's that face?
[38:03.920 --> 38:04.600]  Oh, a bit higher.
[38:04.760 --> 38:05.800]  Getting clanked.
[38:06.040 --> 38:06.360]  That's it.
[38:06.640 --> 38:07.040]  Ooh.
[38:07.780 --> 38:08.760]  Careful, careful, careful.
[38:08.980 --> 38:09.120]  There we go.
[38:09.340 --> 38:09.900]  You guys got it.
[38:10.620 --> 38:11.980]  We've died in a room like this before.
[38:13.740 --> 38:14.900]  Died in every room.
[38:15.360 --> 38:15.900]  You know what?
[38:15.900 --> 38:17.000]  Fair point.
[38:17.140 --> 38:22.560]  I just see Geoff's mouth popping open and closed when you slam your mouth on the table.
[38:29.260 --> 38:31.900]  It's like table-desk noises in his mouth.
[38:34.640 --> 38:35.400]  Anything over there?
[38:36.260 --> 38:37.880]  Can you look in this while I hold it open?
[38:38.360 --> 38:38.780]  Yeah, I got it.
[38:39.100 --> 38:39.820]  Yeah, it's nothing empty.
[38:40.000 --> 38:40.780]  Of course it is.
[38:41.100 --> 38:42.560]  Dude, everything's empty here.
[38:42.680 --> 38:43.300]  This is crazy.
[38:43.560 --> 38:45.520]  Surely there's a gold mine somewhere, right?
[38:46.680 --> 38:47.720]  Careful, careful, careful.
[38:48.440 --> 38:49.760]  Does this blow up?
[38:50.240 --> 38:50.340]  Ow!
[38:51.320 --> 38:51.760]  Shit.
[38:52.040 --> 38:52.500]  I'm sorry.
[38:53.700 --> 38:54.680]  It's the opposite of careful.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.640]  Yeah, he just swung it into me.
[39:00.080 --> 39:00.960]  Good arm, though.
[39:01.360 --> 39:01.540]  Ooh.
[39:01.900 --> 39:02.340]  Whoa.
[39:03.140 --> 39:03.980]  Check this out.
[39:04.520 --> 39:04.780]  What do you see?
[39:04.820 --> 39:05.120]  What do you see?
[39:06.160 --> 39:06.820]  This thing.
[39:07.060 --> 39:07.460]  A broom?
[39:07.820 --> 39:08.260]  Ooh.
[39:08.900 --> 39:11.840]  Yeah, but it's a...
[39:11.840 --> 39:13.700]  Oh, there's a little deal in here.
[39:13.860 --> 39:15.460]  But this is gonna take two people, I think.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.460]  Are we talking about this broom?
[39:17.460 --> 39:17.800]  Yeah.
[39:18.020 --> 39:18.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:19.140 --> 39:20.020]  Can you grab it?
[39:20.740 --> 39:22.060]  Uh, the wall says run.
[39:23.080 --> 39:23.620]  In blood.
[39:23.960 --> 39:24.040]  What?
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.960]  There's a message that says run.
[39:27.160 --> 39:28.820]  It's probably easier to just put it in the cart.
[39:28.820 --> 39:29.360]  Bring the cart.
[39:29.560 --> 39:30.880]  Yeah, it might.
[39:31.220 --> 39:31.540]  I don't know.
[39:31.680 --> 39:32.000]  I can't hear it.
[39:32.400 --> 39:33.180]  Probably not good.
[39:33.460 --> 39:33.620]  Okay.
[39:34.080 --> 39:35.140]  Oh, Nick, don't move.
[39:35.540 --> 39:35.700]  Ah!
[39:35.960 --> 39:36.160]  Ah!
[39:36.260 --> 39:36.620]  Ah!
[39:37.000 --> 39:37.240]  Ah!
[39:42.390 --> 39:43.750]  What the fuck was that?
[39:43.930 --> 39:44.350]  I don't know.
[39:44.370 --> 39:45.170]  It came out of nowhere.
[39:45.550 --> 39:46.270]  What was that?
[39:46.710 --> 39:48.270]  It stared at me and I got tunnel vision.
[39:49.010 --> 39:49.510]  Me too.
[39:51.090 --> 39:53.370]  I think it's a scary monster.
[39:53.450 --> 39:54.870]  Oh, shit.
[39:57.150 --> 39:58.290]  Big floating head.
[39:58.650 --> 39:59.170]  Right by Gavin.
[40:02.570 --> 40:03.270]  You alright?
[40:04.450 --> 40:04.830]  Yeah.
[40:05.270 --> 40:06.090]  Did you get tunnel vision again?
[40:07.050 --> 40:08.070]  No, that was real scary.
[40:08.210 --> 40:08.810]  They're so big.
[40:11.110 --> 40:11.910]  Where'd it go?
[40:12.810 --> 40:14.730]  It went through this one open door here.
[40:17.370 --> 40:18.970]  Do you want me to just bring the cart first?
[40:20.290 --> 40:21.170]  I guess so.
[40:21.570 --> 40:22.410]  Yeah, I think it would be easier.
[40:22.410 --> 40:22.770]  I can get it.
[40:22.910 --> 40:23.330]  I can get it.
[40:23.990 --> 40:24.930]  Don't stomp on it.
[40:27.250 --> 40:28.370]  I didn't think it would do anything.
[40:28.970 --> 40:30.430]  Hey, we should take it to the extraction.
[40:30.930 --> 40:33.430]  Because it's not going to fit in the cart with everything we have in there already.
[40:33.810 --> 40:34.290]  Okay, okay.
[40:34.830 --> 40:35.750]  Which is the fastest way?
[40:35.910 --> 40:36.290]  Oh, this way.
[40:36.350 --> 40:36.490]  Perfect.
[40:36.950 --> 40:37.130]  Yep.
[40:39.130 --> 40:40.190]  Alright, you guys come this way.
[40:40.190 --> 40:40.850]  Yeah, we might as well.
[40:40.970 --> 40:42.550]  Why don't you grab the cart and take it over?
[40:43.110 --> 40:43.730]  Nick, you lead.
[40:44.490 --> 40:44.950]  Oh, alright.
[40:45.090 --> 40:45.590]  I'll lead you guys.
[40:45.970 --> 40:46.410]  Follow me, this way.
[40:46.450 --> 40:47.610]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's Geoff.
[40:48.090 --> 40:49.110]  Is it this way, Nick?
[40:50.410 --> 40:51.070]  Yeah, this way.
[40:51.230 --> 40:52.990]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Geoff.
[40:53.470 --> 40:54.310]  You gotta look at it, Geoff.
[40:55.030 --> 40:55.530]  Oh, yeah.
[41:01.220 --> 41:01.580]  Stop.
[41:01.940 --> 41:02.600]  Oh my god.
[41:02.900 --> 41:03.660]  We got it, we got it.
[41:05.340 --> 41:07.040]  I'm playing with fucking monkeys.
[41:07.620 --> 41:10.240]  We got it, we got it, we got it.
[41:10.460 --> 41:11.160]  We got it.
[41:11.300 --> 41:12.680]  We gotta go backwards, but we got it.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.860]  Keep going, keep going.
[41:15.340 --> 41:16.720]  Yeah, keep going, keep going.
[41:17.560 --> 41:18.360]  Keep going, keep going.
[41:18.380 --> 41:18.980]  No, you're both trying to get me.
[41:19.040 --> 41:20.500]  Straight ahead, straight ahead, keep going, keep going.
[41:20.500 --> 41:21.720]  And now you're in the room.
[41:22.220 --> 41:23.400]  Hang on, hang on.
[41:23.520 --> 41:24.880]  We're gonna put it here.
[41:25.580 --> 41:27.320]  I'm gonna bring it closer to me and we're gonna set it down.
[41:31.720 --> 41:32.920]  Hang on, let me out.
[41:33.460 --> 41:34.320]  Alright, we'll need a little bit more.
[41:34.540 --> 41:35.420]  How much is that?
[41:35.600 --> 41:36.540]  Oh, we're gonna be short.
[41:37.020 --> 41:38.380]  We need to, let's leave the vase.
[41:38.540 --> 41:41.240]  Let's take the vase out and we'll just bring the cart with us again.
[41:41.660 --> 41:43.180]  Okay, who's grabbing the vase?
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.480]  I'll, someone help me, yeah.
[41:45.640 --> 41:45.860]  There we go.
[41:45.940 --> 41:46.720]  There you go.
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.760]  Right over, oh, no, no, no, no.
[41:53.000 --> 41:53.660]  You're good, you got it.
[41:53.740 --> 41:54.240]  Okay, got it.
[41:54.280 --> 41:55.420]  Perfect, good job.
[41:56.380 --> 41:58.240]  Okay, good work, good work.
[41:58.240 --> 41:58.520]  Oh, nice.
[41:58.580 --> 41:59.820]  That was, we did good stuff.
[41:59.900 --> 42:01.220]  They wobble, but they don't fall down.
[42:01.620 --> 42:02.280]  Okay, you can put it there.
[42:03.520 --> 42:04.820]  Alright, we need another 7k.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.940]  No problem, we got $600 right here.
[42:09.400 --> 42:10.800]  Oops, $500 right here.
[42:18.100 --> 42:19.160]  Oh, good idea.
[42:19.320 --> 42:20.800]  That's where the magic happens.
[42:21.780 --> 42:22.360]  Pop them.
[42:25.400 --> 42:26.240]  Here comes...
[42:26.240 --> 42:28.080]  Oh, no.
[42:28.520 --> 42:28.920]  Professor?
[42:33.380 --> 42:35.540]  Oh, there's a lot of cash up here.
[42:35.780 --> 42:36.080]  Grab it.
[42:36.140 --> 42:36.380]  Nice.
[42:36.640 --> 42:37.720]  We need that for the money.
[42:39.920 --> 42:40.220]  Well said.
[42:40.440 --> 42:42.280]  I'm gonna, can someone take this from me?
[42:42.940 --> 42:44.400]  I don't want to drop it and lose it.
[42:44.680 --> 42:45.460]  He's here.
[42:45.460 --> 42:47.340]  I love you, Harold.
[42:47.980 --> 42:48.520]  Uh oh.
[42:50.720 --> 42:51.240]  Where's the cart?
[42:53.720 --> 42:54.220]  Good question.
[42:54.580 --> 42:55.500]  I'm looking for it.
[42:55.800 --> 42:56.000]  Okay.
[42:56.380 --> 42:57.100]  Have you been looking long?
[42:58.100 --> 42:58.460]  Nope.
[42:59.900 --> 43:01.480]  Is he gonna keep going back the way he came?
[43:03.640 --> 43:04.000]  Gavin!
[43:05.500 --> 43:07.240]  I'm just gonna put it in the thing at this point.
[43:07.520 --> 43:08.320]  No, that, oh yeah.
[43:08.460 --> 43:08.840]  You know what?
[43:09.120 --> 43:09.780]  Probably for the best.
[43:12.340 --> 43:13.700]  Let's take out the middle man.
[43:15.560 --> 43:15.960]  Exactly.
[43:20.100 --> 43:20.500]  Sweet.
[43:20.700 --> 43:21.140]  Good job, Nick.
[43:21.360 --> 43:21.540]  Alright.
[43:22.640 --> 43:23.140]  There you go.
[43:25.460 --> 43:26.900]  I think we're doing pretty well here, yeah?
[43:26.940 --> 43:27.980]  Yeah, we're getting progress.
[43:29.740 --> 43:30.500]  Those explode.
[43:30.740 --> 43:31.080]  Here they come.
[43:31.320 --> 43:31.680]  Careful with that.
[43:31.700 --> 43:32.240]  Around the door.
[43:32.760 --> 43:33.040]  Corner.
[43:33.180 --> 43:33.940]  I don't want to go back anyway.
[43:36.100 --> 43:36.820]  Where's the bot?
[43:36.920 --> 43:37.180]  Where's the bot?
[43:37.740 --> 43:39.060]  What the f***?
[43:39.540 --> 43:40.660]  What the hell was that?
[43:42.920 --> 43:43.920]  What the f***?
[43:43.920 --> 43:44.560]  F***!
[43:45.140 --> 43:46.120]  Oh my god!
[43:46.200 --> 43:46.820]  Someone's dead!
[43:46.900 --> 43:47.740]  Someone's dead as dicks!
[43:47.780 --> 43:48.520]  Yeah, I saw it!
[43:48.600 --> 43:49.700]  They like exploded!
[43:51.560 --> 43:52.040]  Yeah, Eric?
[43:53.800 --> 43:54.560]  Taking a back.
[43:56.680 --> 43:57.860]  I think Eric's got one too.
[43:59.760 --> 44:01.720]  Should I go back the way you came from?
[44:02.420 --> 44:03.080]  I don't know.
[44:03.760 --> 44:04.960]  I don't f***ing know where I'm going.
[44:06.120 --> 44:06.600]  Where's Eric?
[44:06.620 --> 44:07.380]  I found you.
[44:07.500 --> 44:08.840]  I found you completely by accident.
[44:09.040 --> 44:09.340]  Oh, okay.
[44:11.240 --> 44:12.400]  Put his hand on the thing.
[44:12.400 --> 44:14.480]  It's all the way to the right or something.
[44:14.600 --> 44:15.160]  Hey, Gavin!
[44:15.240 --> 44:15.760]  You're alive!
[44:16.080 --> 44:16.240]  Yep.
[44:17.440 --> 44:18.200]  Super alive.
[44:18.840 --> 44:19.480]  Got the car.
[44:19.620 --> 44:20.580]  Oh, so Eric's the one who's dead?
[44:21.180 --> 44:21.660]  Eric died?
[44:23.680 --> 44:24.460]  I think so.
[44:24.540 --> 44:25.200]  Have we seen his head?
[44:25.360 --> 44:26.100]  Yeah, I think that's Eric.
[44:27.500 --> 44:28.400]  His head's back there.
[44:28.480 --> 44:29.240]  Well, Eric didn't die.
[44:29.780 --> 44:30.640]  Oh yeah, damn.
[44:31.140 --> 44:31.900]  When did he die off?
[44:33.560 --> 44:35.720]  That ghost thing that chucked you guys earlier?
[44:35.920 --> 44:37.500]  Came in and uh...
[44:37.500 --> 44:38.320]  He got monstered.
[44:38.760 --> 44:39.900]  Yeah, he got monstered real good.
[44:43.680 --> 44:44.180]  Alright.
[44:45.040 --> 44:45.940]  So he'll be back.
[44:46.200 --> 44:48.100]  Hopefully Andrew didn't just die, because that sounded bad.
[44:48.580 --> 44:49.400]  And then uh...
[44:50.120 --> 44:51.400]  We'll go find the other extraction point.
[44:52.040 --> 44:53.160]  Oh my god!
[44:53.920 --> 44:54.420]  Jesus!
[44:56.260 --> 44:57.080]  Andrew, you alright?
[44:57.440 --> 44:57.720]  Super alive.
[44:58.060 --> 45:00.320]  There's a man spider back there and he attacked me.
[45:00.560 --> 45:01.560]  I didn't like it.
[45:01.700 --> 45:02.840]  A man spider.
[45:03.580 --> 45:04.300]  Man spider.
[45:04.540 --> 45:05.100]  Spider man?
[45:05.420 --> 45:05.680]  No!
[45:06.140 --> 45:06.920]  No, my...
[45:06.920 --> 45:08.040]  It's a man spider.
[45:08.740 --> 45:09.380]  Completely different.
[45:09.380 --> 45:09.820]  Are you a crime?
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.040]  Was he trying to fight you?
[45:12.040 --> 45:13.680]  I don't know, but I was tingling.
[45:15.280 --> 45:15.680]  Okay.
[45:16.320 --> 45:17.060]  We didn't even know that.
[45:17.060 --> 45:19.060]  Who has the most health and wants to give me 10?
[45:20.420 --> 45:21.300]  I have 18.
[45:21.500 --> 45:21.740]  Give me 10.
[45:22.360 --> 45:22.680]  Please.
[45:25.640 --> 45:26.160]  Thank you.
[45:26.220 --> 45:26.740]  There he is!
[45:26.920 --> 45:27.800]  That's the man spider!
[45:30.380 --> 45:30.780]  Where?
[45:31.440 --> 45:31.800]  Where?
[45:32.100 --> 45:32.720]  This is shit.
[45:33.060 --> 45:33.740]  What is he talking about?
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.100]  I don't see a damn thing.
[45:35.620 --> 45:36.240]  Are we hiding?
[45:37.280 --> 45:37.620]  I don't know.
[45:37.700 --> 45:38.760]  He said something about a man spider.
[45:39.520 --> 45:40.640]  Yeah, Andrew said man spider.
[45:40.640 --> 45:41.440]  Is he...
[45:41.440 --> 45:43.200]  Is Andrew getting attacked by shadows again?
[45:43.280 --> 45:45.600]  Is he looking at...
[45:45.600 --> 45:46.840]  You off your meds, Andrew.
[45:47.800 --> 45:48.300]  Hell no.
[45:48.920 --> 45:49.460]  Hey, what's up, man?
[45:50.060 --> 45:51.220]  Where did the spider touch you?
[45:51.460 --> 45:52.280]  Oh, look, Geoff!
[45:53.180 --> 45:53.620]  Oh!
[45:54.460 --> 45:55.680]  It's a Hellraiser thing.
[45:57.520 --> 45:58.220]  What's a Hellraiser?
[45:58.220 --> 45:59.040]  Hey, something sounds bad.
[46:00.940 --> 46:01.620]  Let's lift it up.
[46:02.340 --> 46:03.540]  What are the things called in Hellraiser?
[46:03.740 --> 46:04.180]  Like...
[46:04.180 --> 46:04.960]  Cinnabons or something?
[46:05.320 --> 46:06.020]  Oh, Cinnabons.
[46:06.260 --> 46:06.700]  Cinnabites.
[46:07.800 --> 46:08.240]  Cinnabons.
[46:08.460 --> 46:08.900]  Cinnabites.
[46:10.540 --> 46:11.040]  Cinnabites.
[46:11.340 --> 46:11.680]  Bites.
[46:13.560 --> 46:14.060]  Cinnabites?
[46:14.340 --> 46:14.520]  I haven't seen that movie.
[46:14.600 --> 46:15.200]  There's another one.
[46:15.220 --> 46:15.700]  I haven't either.
[46:15.820 --> 46:15.880]  Hi.
[46:17.720 --> 46:18.220]  Oh!
[46:18.940 --> 46:19.140]  Oh!
[46:20.680 --> 46:21.180]  Oh!
[46:23.420 --> 46:23.540]  Oh!
[46:23.760 --> 46:23.840]  Oh!
[46:23.840 --> 46:24.320]  Oh!
[46:24.740 --> 46:24.920]  Oh!
[46:25.680 --> 46:26.180]  Oh!
[46:26.920 --> 46:27.420]  Oh!
[46:28.200 --> 46:28.340]  Oh!
[46:28.340 --> 46:29.000]  Geoff.
[46:31.280 --> 46:31.880]  Geoff, are you okay?
[46:34.440 --> 46:35.360]  That motherfucking box.
[46:39.320 --> 46:39.580]  Okay.
[46:41.400 --> 46:41.800]  Oh!
[46:42.620 --> 46:43.120]  Where's the grenade?
[46:45.320 --> 46:47.320]  Let's go back to the ship, quick!
[46:47.820 --> 46:48.480]  We need the grenade!
[46:49.340 --> 46:49.900]  We need the grenade!
[46:54.360 --> 46:55.780]  I would go faster, but I'm out of st-
[46:55.780 --> 46:56.080]  Uh-oh.
[47:04.470 --> 47:06.550]  What the fuck was that?
[47:07.670 --> 47:09.210]  Everything's real dark.
[47:18.210 --> 47:20.590]  Put him in the cupboard.
[47:21.830 --> 47:23.570]  Put him in the cupboard.
[47:27.470 --> 47:31.350]  Around the world, around the world.
[47:32.130 --> 47:33.810]  I'm gonna throw up.
[47:35.290 --> 47:37.070]  There's a creature waiting by the door.
[47:37.270 --> 47:37.830]  Is it a man spider?
[47:38.170 --> 47:38.310]  Oh, okay.
[47:38.850 --> 47:40.570]  Yeah, I think so, or some-
[47:40.570 --> 47:43.490]  It's like the girl from The Ring.
[47:43.990 --> 47:44.870]  Oh, that's not the man spider.
[47:44.870 --> 47:45.110]  Oh, Ringo?
[47:46.150 --> 47:46.590]  Ringo.
[47:48.290 --> 47:48.730]  Ringo.
[47:49.330 --> 47:50.150]  It's Ringo.
[47:50.490 --> 47:50.650]  Oh.
[47:51.390 --> 47:52.610]  Should we get this other Cinnabon?
[47:53.030 --> 47:53.250]  Yeah.
[47:53.410 --> 47:54.590]  Why don't we grab the cart?
[47:54.670 --> 47:55.170]  Where's the cart?
[47:55.990 --> 47:56.790]  It's back there.
[47:56.850 --> 47:58.430]  I think he destroyed it.
[47:59.210 --> 47:59.550]  What?
[47:59.550 --> 48:01.090]  No, not that box.
[48:01.110 --> 48:02.090]  He destroyed a giant box.
[48:02.090 --> 48:02.290]  What?
[48:02.450 --> 48:04.150]  But he also gave us this orb.
[48:04.270 --> 48:04.950]  What's happening?
[48:05.250 --> 48:06.030]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[48:06.150 --> 48:07.010]  I have a love potion.
[48:08.090 --> 48:08.570]  Okay.
[48:09.570 --> 48:10.370]  Oh, who do you love?
[48:10.690 --> 48:11.850]  Gabby Goo, apparently.
[48:13.210 --> 48:14.170]  Aw, thanks.
[48:14.630 --> 48:15.590]  Oh, you like Geoff now.
[48:19.430 --> 48:22.490]  What else do I say?
[48:23.150 --> 48:25.310]  You should hear like a thrumming noise.
[48:26.710 --> 48:27.690]  Oh, it's up here.
[48:29.110 --> 48:31.090]  You like Nick now.
[48:31.170 --> 48:32.430]  I want to go through everywhere.
[48:37.990 --> 48:38.430]  Boys?
[48:38.970 --> 48:39.410]  Hey.
[48:40.130 --> 48:40.570]  Hey.
[48:42.170 --> 48:43.530]  Hey, there's stuff back here.
[48:44.130 --> 48:44.410]  There's stuff?
[48:44.550 --> 48:45.950]  I don't know how we're getting...
[48:45.950 --> 48:46.170]  Whoa!
[48:46.930 --> 48:47.510]  Bloody thing!
[48:47.770 --> 48:48.270]  Baby thing!
[48:48.290 --> 48:48.890]  No, not again!
[48:54.810 --> 48:55.890]  Grab his head.
[48:56.030 --> 48:56.410]  Let's go.
[48:57.010 --> 48:57.810]  Shit, son.
[48:58.170 --> 49:00.290]  It just zoomed through him and then vanished.
[49:02.470 --> 49:03.230]  Who died?
[49:04.470 --> 49:05.450]  Was it Eric again?
[49:05.830 --> 49:06.590]  Eric. Yeah, Eric.
[49:08.010 --> 49:08.750]  Oh, I heard the boom.
[49:10.050 --> 49:10.670]  What's up there?
[49:11.710 --> 49:12.830]  Why are you putting the car upstairs?
[49:14.210 --> 49:15.090]  It's gotta go upstairs.
[49:15.650 --> 49:16.190]  We gotta bring it.
[49:16.430 --> 49:16.710]  Oh, I see.
[49:16.730 --> 49:16.970]  Help me.
[49:17.690 --> 49:18.450]  I got it.
[49:19.750 --> 49:20.150]  Help me.
[49:20.430 --> 49:21.210]  You guys got it?
[49:21.290 --> 49:21.690]  I'll get Eric.
[49:21.710 --> 49:22.550]  His head is separate.
[49:23.370 --> 49:24.350]  Yeah, I got it.
[49:24.570 --> 49:24.870]  Okay.
[49:26.350 --> 49:26.890]  What about Andrew?
[49:28.330 --> 49:28.710]  Hopefully...
[49:29.450 --> 49:30.270]  Did Andrew live?
[49:30.270 --> 49:30.950]  Andrew, come on, quick.
[49:31.050 --> 49:31.990]  Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it.
[49:32.050 --> 49:32.990]  Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it.
[49:33.110 --> 49:35.110]  Oh, well, we don't have enough money yet, so...
[49:35.110 --> 49:37.110]  Oh, we need like 600 bucks.
[49:37.690 --> 49:38.130]  It's okay.
[49:38.250 --> 49:39.110]  I think I just got enough.
[49:39.230 --> 49:39.570]  The cube!
[49:41.190 --> 49:42.150]  I think I got us over.
[49:42.270 --> 49:42.770]  This is 10 grand.
[49:43.170 --> 49:43.630]  Oh, no, we don't.
[49:43.810 --> 49:44.050]  Never mind.
[49:44.390 --> 49:44.670]  24.
[49:45.410 --> 49:46.290]  I'll help you with the cube.
[49:46.550 --> 49:47.170]  Help me with the cube.
[49:47.670 --> 49:49.550]  We gotta get this Cinnabon to the store.
[49:54.790 --> 49:55.350]  What's this?
[49:56.630 --> 49:57.550]  You wanna go right or left?
[49:58.030 --> 49:59.470]  Oh my god, let's grab this staff.
[49:59.470 --> 50:00.370]  You go right, I'll go left.
[50:01.790 --> 50:04.090]  You wanna test the boundaries of space here?
[50:04.970 --> 50:05.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:05.590 --> 50:05.810]  Okay.
[50:08.690 --> 50:10.010]  How much is your cube worth?
[50:11.650 --> 50:12.910]  It's about to be much less.
[50:15.830 --> 50:16.270]  Jackpot!
[50:16.670 --> 50:17.890]  The staff is magic!
[50:19.170 --> 50:19.910]  Holy shit.
[50:19.910 --> 50:20.770]  What was that about?
[50:20.770 --> 50:22.250]  We dropped the box, Gavin!
[50:24.110 --> 50:25.670]  What was that about?
[50:25.690 --> 50:28.130]  We could have cashed the pocket of the cash, though.
[50:28.130 --> 50:30.450]  We gotta go, we gotta go!
[50:30.550 --> 50:31.470]  Run, run, run, run, run, run!
[50:32.170 --> 50:32.950]  How long do we have?
[50:35.950 --> 50:36.910]  Oh my god!
[50:39.630 --> 50:40.610]  I'm following you, Nick.
[50:40.730 --> 50:40.890]  Nope!
[50:42.410 --> 50:42.970]  Oh god!
[50:43.330 --> 50:43.670]  Oh god!
[50:44.110 --> 50:44.710]  Oh god!
[50:45.130 --> 50:45.690]  Oh god!
[50:45.830 --> 50:46.390]  What did you see?
[50:46.750 --> 50:48.390]  The head monster.
[50:50.610 --> 50:51.150]  He's coming.
[50:53.350 --> 50:55.650]  I'm watching Andrew slop into the...
[50:59.270 --> 51:00.250]  Man spider!
[51:05.320 --> 51:07.260]  Oh no, I can pick his head up through the covers.
[51:08.720 --> 51:10.740]  I know he's dead because I got a prompt.
[51:11.260 --> 51:12.320]  Oh shit, man spider.
[51:13.160 --> 51:14.110]  I told you!
[51:20.200 --> 51:22.230]  The man spider's killing everyone.
[51:25.180 --> 51:26.260]  Man spider.
[51:29.980 --> 51:32.140]  Go guys, get to the ship!
[51:55.080 --> 51:56.480]  Jesus Christ.
[51:58.700 --> 51:59.680]  Guys?
[52:01.740 --> 52:02.900]  Guys?
[52:04.740 --> 52:05.740]  Run!
[52:09.120 --> 52:09.900]  Thank you.
[52:10.940 --> 52:11.820]  Right there.
[52:15.040 --> 52:18.120]  Get the fuck out of here.
[52:18.200 --> 52:19.140]  Holy shit.
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.620]  I'm back, I can't believe I made it here.
[52:21.640 --> 52:24.700]  Why didn't anyone talk about man spider? What the fuck?
[52:28.640 --> 52:29.640]  Little heads up next time.
[52:30.180 --> 52:32.120]  Wow, that was crazy.
[52:32.980 --> 52:34.340]  That was nuts.
[52:34.580 --> 52:35.260]  That was terrifying.
[52:35.860 --> 52:37.240]  68 grand, guys.
[52:37.360 --> 52:37.760]  Wow.
[52:37.760 --> 52:40.360]  Man spider just screamed into my mouth.
[52:42.940 --> 52:43.980]  Get some stamina.
[52:45.880 --> 52:47.820]  Did it look cool when I was ripped to pieces?
[52:48.860 --> 52:50.540]  I couldn't see.
[52:50.660 --> 52:52.320]  I'll grab medium health pack.
[52:53.020 --> 52:54.980]  I'm gonna grab a stamina upgrade.
[52:55.880 --> 52:56.520]  I did the same.
[52:57.340 --> 52:58.760]  Getting a sprint speed upgrade.
[52:59.660 --> 52:59.820]  Yeah.
[53:00.840 --> 53:02.460]  I guess there's enough for us each to get two.
[53:02.740 --> 53:04.100]  Frying pan's interesting.
[53:06.860 --> 53:08.640]  Ooh, what's a pocket cart?
[53:09.140 --> 53:10.680]  Oh my god.
[53:15.600 --> 53:17.440]  Your mouth moved into that.
[53:19.740 --> 53:22.380]  Hey, we're looking good money wise.
[53:22.460 --> 53:24.680]  We can get all of these upgrades.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.900]  Whatever, I just don't think we need a ton of them.
[53:27.040 --> 53:31.040]  But what is extraction tracker and what is pocket cart?
[53:32.080 --> 53:33.220]  Oh, what's a pocket cart?
[53:33.340 --> 53:34.000]  It's this little cart.
[53:34.640 --> 53:35.700]  What does it do?
[53:35.940 --> 53:37.600]  You think you can put stuff in it?
[53:38.140 --> 53:39.480]  I think maybe it's just a dinky one.
[53:39.900 --> 53:40.760]  Like a second one?
[53:41.280 --> 53:42.160]  Should we try it?
[53:43.360 --> 53:43.760]  Sure.
[53:44.280 --> 53:45.940]  We can just have to move one of these things out.
[53:46.140 --> 53:47.720]  It doesn't fit much.
[53:49.660 --> 53:51.520]  Maybe it's like a pocket of holding.
[53:52.720 --> 53:54.580]  A bag of holding in D&D.
[53:55.040 --> 53:56.540]  Ooh, so it gives you extra space.
[53:57.180 --> 53:58.560]  You think you can put stuff in it?
[54:00.720 --> 54:01.560]  Let's give it a shot.
[54:02.620 --> 54:03.340]  You ready?
[54:03.660 --> 54:05.040]  Wait, you took out the health upgrade?
[54:05.280 --> 54:06.100]  That I put in.
[54:06.300 --> 54:06.960]  That was my health upgrade.
[54:07.160 --> 54:07.760]  I'm going to do a...
[54:09.020 --> 54:10.540]  No, I'm going to heal myself though.
[54:14.440 --> 54:18.140]  Let me take out the stamina upgrade and you take the health upgrade.
[54:18.260 --> 54:20.020]  Because the health upgrade is going to be more important, I think.
[54:21.220 --> 54:23.640]  I'll get out the sprint speed upgrade as well.
[54:25.520 --> 54:29.320]  Now we have 17 grand more you can put in.
[54:31.160 --> 54:32.040]  I think...
[54:32.040 --> 54:33.380]  Here, let's do this.
[54:33.480 --> 54:35.860]  What do you think this extraction tracker is?
[54:37.100 --> 54:39.740]  I guess it just tells us where the second one is.
[54:41.780 --> 54:44.960]  So you hold it and it probably goes boop, boop, boop.
[54:46.200 --> 54:47.300]  It's a stud finder, you know.
[54:49.540 --> 54:50.620]  Don't point it at me!
[54:52.620 --> 55:01.560]  Why don't you guys get these upgrades that you were going to get, Geoff and Nick, and then I'll go without.
[55:01.700 --> 55:02.140]  It's not a big deal.
[55:02.580 --> 55:03.080]  That's fine.
[55:03.400 --> 55:04.860]  It's 3k, it's not a big deal.
[55:05.180 --> 55:05.580]  I think we're good.
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.720]  I wonder what zero gravity drone is.
[55:07.940 --> 55:09.560]  Are you going to get this upgrade?
[55:10.660 --> 55:11.380]  We're going to be short.
[55:11.400 --> 55:12.180]  I think I already put mine in.
[55:12.360 --> 55:12.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:13.080 --> 55:13.940]  Go ahead and hit the button.
[55:14.400 --> 55:15.220]  Alright, got it. Let's go.
[55:18.520 --> 55:19.140]  To the ship!
[55:19.140 --> 55:20.640]  Oh wait, do we need to bring the cart?
[55:20.760 --> 55:20.920]  What do you think?
[55:21.900 --> 55:22.580]  No, it's not there.
[55:22.620 --> 55:22.740]  Okay.
[55:23.860 --> 55:25.140]  It's not in the spot, so...
[55:26.640 --> 55:27.400]  Let's do it!
[55:28.380 --> 55:29.000]  Let's go!
[55:29.820 --> 55:30.220]  Yeehaw!
[55:31.700 --> 55:32.440]  Manspider was scary.
[55:32.540 --> 55:36.620]  Were any of you guys haunted by like a ghost-like girl?
[55:37.240 --> 55:38.320]  That's what killed me twice.
[55:38.820 --> 55:40.840]  Yeah, the ring girl.
[55:41.180 --> 55:42.700]  Yeah, that's what killed me two times.
[55:43.180 --> 55:44.640]  That's what I was screaming about most of the time.
[55:44.880 --> 55:45.060]  Yep.
[55:45.380 --> 55:46.960]  So you guys got all this stuff.
[55:48.400 --> 55:48.760]  Cool.
[55:48.940 --> 55:50.380]  Okay, so we still have the stun grenade.
[55:51.320 --> 55:52.040]  Pocket cart.
[55:53.840 --> 55:54.940]  Did someone not use their thing?
[55:55.040 --> 55:56.020]  There's a stamina upgrade here.
[55:56.320 --> 55:56.700]  Is there?
[55:57.680 --> 55:59.480]  Yeah, I already used all my stuff.
[55:59.980 --> 56:01.320]  I'll take it if no one else is taking it.
[56:01.460 --> 56:02.300]  What's everybody's health at?
[56:03.260 --> 56:03.620]  46.
[56:05.040 --> 56:05.400]  36.
[56:06.640 --> 56:06.900]  Nick?
[56:06.960 --> 56:07.520]  You didn't buy health?
[56:07.640 --> 56:08.000]  26.
[56:08.700 --> 56:09.900]  Nick, let me give you health.
[56:10.560 --> 56:11.140]  We didn't have any money.
[56:14.060 --> 56:16.160]  Okay, and then Eric, where are you at?
[56:16.160 --> 56:17.360]  I'm at 36.
[56:17.500 --> 56:17.940]  You don't have to.
[56:18.000 --> 56:18.260]  I'm okay.
[56:18.520 --> 56:18.940]  That's alright.
[56:19.080 --> 56:21.620]  I got health.
[56:22.700 --> 56:23.220]  Thank you.
[56:23.440 --> 56:24.320]  Okay, you guys ready?
[56:24.720 --> 56:24.820]  Yeah.
[56:26.480 --> 56:29.380]  You looking backwards while talking is very disconcerting.
[56:29.820 --> 56:32.480]  Dude, that's how you do the items.
[56:32.860 --> 56:33.880]  Oh, you shrunk it.
[56:35.020 --> 56:36.260]  That's how you do the items.
[56:36.560 --> 56:37.280]  You shrunk it.
[56:37.900 --> 56:39.960]  You grab it and you press 1, 2, or 3.
[56:40.160 --> 56:40.480]  Do it.
[56:40.600 --> 56:41.520]  Somebody grab the stun grenade.
[56:41.900 --> 56:43.220]  Who's going to be in charge of the stun grenade?
[56:43.420 --> 56:44.940]  Pick it up and press 1, 2, or 3.
[56:44.940 --> 56:45.660]  Oh.
[56:46.860 --> 56:47.460]  Well, that's good to know.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.800]  I don't want the responsibility of a grenade.
[56:51.020 --> 56:51.440]  I've got it.
[56:51.520 --> 56:52.440]  Gavin's got it.
[56:52.840 --> 56:55.220]  I was going to say, it's probably should be Gavin.
[56:56.600 --> 56:57.940]  He's the easiest to kill at.
[56:59.580 --> 56:59.980]  Alright.
[57:00.540 --> 57:01.180]  I heard a duck.
[57:02.280 --> 57:03.120]  I have a...
[57:03.120 --> 57:03.780]  Oh, it's that thing.
[57:03.940 --> 57:04.100]  Okay.
[57:04.400 --> 57:04.540]  Yeah.
[57:05.800 --> 57:06.200]  Boom.
[57:06.780 --> 57:07.140]  Nice.
[57:08.180 --> 57:09.580]  We got a base already.
[57:10.080 --> 57:10.580]  Oh, shit.
[57:10.760 --> 57:11.180]  Hell yeah.
[57:11.300 --> 57:13.800]  Guys, this is our fourth stage again, so let's...
[57:13.800 --> 57:15.800]  This is as far as we've made it.
[57:26.500 --> 57:27.550]  What happened?
[57:28.350 --> 57:29.730]  What happened there?
[57:31.030 --> 57:32.030]  It just went.
[57:32.870 --> 57:33.950]  It just went.
[57:35.250 --> 57:35.490]  Oops.
[57:35.770 --> 57:36.370]  God damn.
[57:37.990 --> 57:39.690]  Who broke the...
[57:39.690 --> 57:40.790]  Damn it.
[57:41.370 --> 57:42.210]  Nobody can tell.
[57:43.190 --> 57:44.670]  Yeah, there's a lot of breaking.
[57:45.490 --> 57:46.930]  Stuff's pretty break-y in this room.
[57:46.990 --> 57:47.610]  It's a bad room.
[57:48.230 --> 57:48.770]  Oh, yeah.
[57:48.830 --> 57:49.750]  I'm sure it's the room.
[57:50.290 --> 57:51.990]  Yeah, apparently Geoff's pretty break-y too.
[58:04.210 --> 58:05.910]  I don't love the pocket cart.
[58:06.090 --> 58:07.650]  It's a thing that I can pull out of nowhere,
[58:07.850 --> 58:10.070]  and then, like, it'll help us carry some stuff around.
[58:10.550 --> 58:11.990]  But I think next time we skip it,
[58:12.050 --> 58:13.390]  we go for, like, weapons and stuff,
[58:13.510 --> 58:14.350]  now that we know how to hold them.
[58:14.490 --> 58:15.950]  There's a smoke monster on the ceiling.
[58:16.090 --> 58:16.550]  Is he upstairs?
[58:18.150 --> 58:18.750]  A smoke monster?
[58:19.330 --> 58:20.570]  Yeah, there's smoke on the ceiling.
[58:20.570 --> 58:22.110]  Alien! Alien! Alien!
[58:30.100 --> 58:30.920]  Oh, hello.
[58:38.000 --> 58:38.440]  Eric.
[58:40.020 --> 58:43.240]  Uh-oh. I'm in the air.
[58:43.400 --> 58:44.720]  Oh, why? Why are we in the air?
[58:44.840 --> 58:45.180]  Uh-oh.
[58:45.400 --> 58:46.940]  Why did you... Why did you touch him?
[58:48.380 --> 58:48.880]  Get him!
[58:50.000 --> 58:50.440]  Eric!
[58:54.480 --> 58:55.380]  Why did you...
[58:55.380 --> 58:55.940]  Guys, his...
[58:55.940 --> 58:57.940]  Guys, his name is The Mentalist.
[58:58.940 --> 59:00.300]  I don't think we're supposed to touch him.
[59:04.620 --> 59:05.860]  There's three extraction points.
[59:05.860 --> 59:06.740]  Yeah, level four is where we...
[59:06.740 --> 59:08.580]  Dude, level four is where we learn, bro.
[59:08.820 --> 59:10.520]  We were never destined for level five.
[59:11.420 --> 59:11.820]  No.
[59:12.460 --> 59:13.540]  Oh, it's a little pocket cart.
[59:13.900 --> 59:14.600]  And a bunch of...
[59:14.600 --> 59:16.460]  Geoff! Geoff! Geoff!
[59:16.460 --> 59:17.060]  Oh!
[59:30.740 --> 59:31.540]  He lived?
[59:31.620 --> 59:32.200]  He lived!
[59:32.240 --> 59:32.820]  He lived?
[59:32.940 --> 59:35.280]  How did he live?
[59:35.460 --> 59:36.280]  Did he have health upgrades?
[59:36.640 --> 59:36.760]  Fuck.
[59:37.440 --> 59:37.900]  I just got violated.
[59:37.900 --> 59:38.560]  Oh my god.
[59:40.620 --> 59:41.900]  I can't believe he lived.
[59:41.920 --> 59:42.740]  I can't believe he lived.
[59:45.100 --> 59:46.100]  How much money is in there?
[59:46.100 --> 59:47.180]  That's crazy.
[59:47.260 --> 59:47.460]  Wow.
[59:47.460 --> 59:47.680]  Fuck.
[59:51.460 --> 59:52.140]  Oh, it's Andrea.
[59:52.580 --> 59:53.920]  Okay, Andrea's...
[59:53.920 --> 59:54.740]  Cleaning up heads.
[59:55.460 --> 59:56.000]  Hey, man.
[59:57.860 --> 59:58.260]  Uh...
[59:58.260 --> 59:59.240]  Yeah, there's some kind of alien?
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:00.420]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:00.920]  I saw that.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.000]  Uh...
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.320]  I like the minicart with heads.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.500]  Oh, I'm so sorry, Geoff!
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.540]  Oh, that's okay.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:07.700]  Uh...
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.340]  I think the minicart's kind of just for heads, huh?
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.640]  The minicart's just for heads.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.140]  Oh, hey, we got this thing.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.040]  Uh...
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.980]  Just for two heads, apparently.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:20.960]  Store that.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.520]  Then get this ring.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.340]  Does Andrea know you fell out?
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:24.640]  Uh-oh.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.000]  Fuck!
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:26.140]  Nope.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.080]  Geoff!
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:28.800]  There's an eye in the ceiling!
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.880]  There's an eye in the ceiling!
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.320]  You have to look away!
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:31.760]  Look away!
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:32.780]  Break eye contact.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:33.540]  Break eye contact.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:33.940]  There you go.
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.340]  Break eye contact.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.120]  There you go.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.200]  I don't know what we're gonna do about that.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:40.940]  It disappears.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:41.740]  It comes and goes.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.540]  My god, Geoff.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.820]  Why isn't it...
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:50.400]  Why isn't it moving?
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.700]  Why isn't the pocket cart...
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.220]  ...pocketing?
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:55.880]  Oh, there we go.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.000]  They still left you a head, Eric.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.620]  Oh, of course.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.040]  Yeah, no.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.040]  Nobody cares about little Eric.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.580]  You guys have fun being alive, you know?
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.240]  Are we...
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.660]  Are we thinking we're gonna get that far?
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:10.880]  Yeah!
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.280]  Some of the heads.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.200]  Some of the heads.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:15.920]  3900.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.360]  Oh, yeah, you saw.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.140]  Good.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:20.700]  There it is.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.520]  Thank god.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.620]  We have a lot of work ahead of us, though.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.060]  Yeah, we got a lot of money we need.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.300]  I'm gonna go the other way and just hope that maybe...
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.240]  ...more profitable in the door we haven't explored.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.980]  I'll bring the cart.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:42.920]  Gun here.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:43.600]  Oh!
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.200]  $11,000 thing.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.500]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.460]  Get it, get it, get it, get it.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.540]  Oh, wait, no, no.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.380]  How much money do they lose on this, do you think?
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:55.820]  2100.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:56.360]  Yeah.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.420]  Depends on if Geoff helps or not.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.080]  It doesn't seem to.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.380]  Geoff's gonna start not looking at it and just seeing what he can do.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:07.940]  Oh, wait.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:08.900]  Thank you.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.780]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.780]  That was very funny when you turned the opposite way.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.480]  God, that was...
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.340]  It was just like, what's the fucking point?
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.260]  Come on, guys, you got it.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.440]  Come on, there you go.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.860]  You do that, you bring that cart over, you got it.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.940]  Let's go see how much we have in this.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.860]  Oh, the cart is not even...
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.360]  Okay, awesome.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.720]  Let's get that cart in there.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.760]  Please be enough.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.060]  Did they get my head?
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.880]  Yeah, it's sitting on the platform.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.140]  Is it?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.540]  Oh, boy, is that gonna crush anything?
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.520]  Do I have to make sure that's properly in?
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.240]  I guess we're gonna find out.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:47.820]  Oh, boy.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.780]  What if it crushes our heads?
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.300]  Wow, that's...
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.040]  I think we're okay.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.180]  That was awesome, dude.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:53.880]  Hell yeah.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.040]  Good job, fellas.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:02:59.840]  Why am I in the cart?
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.360]  Get me out of the fucking cart.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.400]  All right.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.020]  All right.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:04.740]  Brilliant.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:06.140]  Where's the big cart?
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.560]  Geoff, a couple of you survived the alien.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:08.520]  Where's the cart?
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.560]  That was scary, dude.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:09.820]  He picked me up.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.640]  I think the big cart was destroyed by the door.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:13.980]  It got triple kill on us.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:14.760]  Guys...
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.260]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.060]  Hey, where's the cart?
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.500]  I think it got crushed.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:20.980]  How does that happen?
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.980]  Because they didn't put it in all the way?
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:22.400]  Yeah.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.340]  I didn't even know that was possible.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.220]  Boys, now's the time.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.960]  Guys, now's the time for me to really sail.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:29.920]  Boom, baby.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.580]  Welcome to the future.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.000]  Okay.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.180]  There you go.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:39.800]  All right.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:40.740]  1,600.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:41.760]  Sweet.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.680]  We're halfway there.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.300]  To something.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.040]  Hey, there's something right here.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:49.900]  Okay.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:50.260]  Where'd it go?
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.000]  Where'd it go?
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:52.400]  Oh.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.840]  Hey, little thing.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.680]  I got it.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:58.440]  Where are you?
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:03:59.860]  Oh, there you are.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.420]  That's another thing.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.060]  Oh, it's a cramp.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:05.520]  Ooh, what?
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:06.140]  Oh!
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.720]  What is this?
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:08.560]  Oh.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.400]  Bonsai tree, it looks like.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.020]  This thing's worth $20,000.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.100]  Yeah.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.240]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:14.680]  There you go.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.020]  I'm going to see if I can find the next extraction point.
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.960]  Don't we take it to the same...
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.120]  Do we not take it to the same extraction?
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.940]  No, there's two other extraction points.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:22.660]  Oh.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.300]  Oh, I see.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.500]  What's the matter?
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.740]  Let's continue to...
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.340]  Oh, stairs.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.320]  Fuck.
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.620]  Oh, nice.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.560]  Got some stuff here, too.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.760]  We got multi-levels, fellas.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:35.900]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.900]  A guy like me loves stairs.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.040]  We are the champions.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.760]  No time to stare.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:51.740]  Oh.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.340]  Can we take this big truck?
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.980]  That's a big truck.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:11.720]  These real doors? No, those are uh set dressing. Is this the extraction point right here? Yes.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.880]  Yeah, down here. Oh, the door's coming. Oh, good. Is it worth anything?
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.680]  Oh, a little chalice of some sort. Fellers, we found the- oh.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.640]  Eric? Extraction this way? Yeah, it's that way. Eric?
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.300]  A little trophy. Man, this is a pretty slow progress.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:46.320]  Well, Eric's got a little one. Sure.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:54.140]  Oh, alien! Where does that mean? Where? Downstairs? Straight ahead. Oh, Geoff,
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:06:00.240]  let's get this vase. What's up? Alien somewhere. Oh, shit. Okay.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.840]  Alien. Hey. Hey. Andrew. Yeah. Big vase. Let's get it.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.420]  Where's everybody else? Geoff's this way.
[01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:25.010]  We're carrying a vase. Is that alien this way? I didn't see anything. He seems to have pissed off.
[01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:33.070]  Okay. Okay. Did you just slam it to the ground? I didn't do anything.
[01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:40.430]  I think I walked back and my level changed, so it pulled down. Oh, into the ground?
[01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:46.590]  There were stairs down here. I haven't seen Eric in so long.
[01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:54.310]  That's not probably good. Careful. There's only 100 bucks. Eric, is there an alien in there?
[01:06:54.930 --> 01:07:17.650]  Alien! Geoff! No! Well...
[01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:26.550]  Shit. I'm gonna put this in the box. Yeah. Where'd everyone go?
[01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:33.830]  I have a feeling it's not good wherever they went. Oh, shit. Shit bag. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:40.950]  Oh. Breaking the cart really did us in, I think. Yeah, that was rough. Where's the pocket cart?
[01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:47.550]  Uh, I don't know. Dude, these doors open? Oh, you can get in the truck? Oh, cool. Do you have the
[01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:55.370]  keys? Oh, wow. Yeah. In for a room! Oh, yeah! I'm driving! Oh, there's something open. Ow! You hit
[01:07:55.370 --> 01:08:01.150]  me in the head with the door. Ow, my foot. All right, let's go see if the others are alive.
[01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:05.790]  Yeah, let's go have a look. I'm trying to save my sprint, though, because it is gonna get
[01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:12.330]  gnarly when we run into that alien again. Terminal, we can move. There it goes. Goodbye, Andrew!
[01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:23.720]  There's an alien in here! Tell my wife I loved her! Oh, Nick, that was heartbreaking.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.640]  Oh, Geoff on the ceiling? Yeah, I think that was the alien.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:39.060]  Hello? Hello? Yeah, Andrew? Hey, follow me! Okay. Nick died. It was really fucked up. He
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.740]  said, make sure to tell my wife I wasn't all that much of a fan of her. It was really weird.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:49.620]  Found the cart, found their heads. Oh, excellent. Put it in the head cup.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.820]  Here's money. Oh, shit, that's my stun grenade. Cool. Ow.
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:02.580]  There you go. He just dropped the money and lost money. You're like a child,
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:09.460]  you got so excited, you just dropped the bag of cash. Behind you! Behind you! Behind who?
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:14.660]  You! Oh my god.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:31.420]  Damn! That's what killed me.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:37.620]  The damn alien! That's crazy that you said your last words where you weren't that fond of your
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.620]  wife. That was dumb. I think Andrew's misinterpreting. Yeah, I heard it. He said,
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:45.640]  tell my wife I was never that fond of her. What? No! Oh, another last loser!
[01:09:55.150 --> 01:10:08.530]  Spin move! Ow! Where's my hammer? Eggs and bacon! Breakfast! Shit!
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.340]  Jesus Christ. You got blasted off by the same thing Geoff did. How do I use this?
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:34.060]  How do I? No! Against you! Against you!
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:39.220]  Come on!
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.340]  Grab it!
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:04.760]  Yes! That's me! Oh my god. Well guys, thanks for watching another repo. I promise eventually
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.820]  we're gonna get...
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.500]  We're gonna get what? Just know, just know, eventually we're gonna get past level four.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.980]  We are gonna get past level four. Thank you guys for watching. We appreciate it. Check out the
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:26.760]  Patreon. We've been doing this for a year so there's a big back catalog of stuff. Thank you
