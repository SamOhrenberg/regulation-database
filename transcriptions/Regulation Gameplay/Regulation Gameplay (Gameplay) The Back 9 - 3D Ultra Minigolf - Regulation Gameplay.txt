[00:00.000 --> 00:00.700]  I'm ready.
[00:02.860 --> 00:03.660]  I'm ready.
[00:04.220 --> 00:04.700]  I'm ready.
[00:04.700 --> 00:05.040]  We're all ready.
[00:05.460 --> 00:06.120]  You're not ready.
[00:06.180 --> 00:06.480]  There you go.
[00:06.580 --> 00:07.640]  Now you're ready.
[00:07.780 --> 00:08.280]  I'm ready.
[00:08.700 --> 00:10.260]  We're back for the back nine.
[00:11.160 --> 00:12.940]  The front nine made me sick.
[00:13.400 --> 00:13.640]  Yeah.
[00:14.220 --> 00:15.240]  Front nine wasn't great.
[00:16.080 --> 00:18.540]  We tried to get Nick in here for the back nine
[00:18.540 --> 00:20.200]  and he went, oh, I don't want the deals.
[00:20.540 --> 00:21.560]  I don't know what to do.
[00:21.820 --> 00:22.620]  I didn't buy the deals.
[00:22.840 --> 00:23.000]  Yeah.
[00:23.560 --> 00:25.480]  You guys said you were playing 18 last time.
[00:26.520 --> 00:27.800]  So, we're back here.
[00:27.840 --> 00:28.940]  Then you guys dicked around for a long time.
[00:28.960 --> 00:29.140]  Classic four.
[00:29.140 --> 00:30.060]  I didn't buy it.
[00:30.380 --> 00:32.600]  The four horsemen of 3D Ultra Mini Golf.
[00:33.520 --> 00:34.000]  Oh!
[00:34.960 --> 00:37.060]  Right, right where I wanted it.
[00:37.280 --> 00:37.760]  Yeah.
[00:38.480 --> 00:41.060]  Right where I wanted it.
[00:41.200 --> 00:41.880]  Rough trade, bud.
[00:42.600 --> 00:44.260]  That's exactly where I want to be.
[00:44.720 --> 00:44.920]  Thank you.
[00:44.920 --> 00:45.960]  How many beans did you put on that?
[00:46.780 --> 00:47.820]  I, wouldn't you like to know?
[00:48.300 --> 00:48.520]  Yeah.
[00:48.920 --> 00:50.160]  Yeah, tell him.
[00:50.900 --> 00:52.920]  John Cena only goes for beans.
[00:53.560 --> 00:54.320]  I'll tell you right now,
[00:54.360 --> 00:55.680]  it was the wrong amount of beans.
[00:56.440 --> 00:57.680]  That somehow worked.
[00:57.680 --> 00:59.340]  Ah, fuck.
[01:00.200 --> 01:02.620]  Yeah, I did, I did about midway through yellow.
[01:03.080 --> 01:03.360]  Okay.
[01:03.700 --> 01:05.440]  Why did you hit it straight into the pillar?
[01:05.640 --> 01:05.980]  Oh, that's...
[01:05.980 --> 01:07.680]  No, that just, I think that just fucked us.
[01:07.960 --> 01:08.640]  Yeah, that's tough.
[01:09.440 --> 01:10.180]  I don't know where to go.
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.620]  Which way is the hole?
[01:12.600 --> 01:13.580]  Can I just go straight over?
[01:13.900 --> 01:18.580]  I'm telling you, H words sound so British.
[01:19.020 --> 01:19.320]  Ah!
[01:20.340 --> 01:21.020]  Okay, perfect.
[01:21.040 --> 01:21.700]  Well, perfect.
[01:22.260 --> 01:23.080]  The other way down.
[01:23.220 --> 01:24.220]  So, you gotta do it the other way, yeah.
[01:24.660 --> 01:25.220]  You gotta turn around.
[01:25.320 --> 01:26.060]  So, you just want to be...
[01:26.060 --> 01:26.520]  You seem distraught.
[01:26.520 --> 01:28.200]  You just want to be sick again, right?
[01:30.720 --> 01:31.520]  Stick again.
[01:32.340 --> 01:33.800]  Dick? Stick? Sick?
[01:34.320 --> 01:34.440]  Stick.
[01:34.660 --> 01:36.280]  Oh, Eric, look at that.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.200]  Yeah, look at this.
[01:38.240 --> 01:39.440]  You gotta ride the waves here, boys.
[01:42.120 --> 01:43.420]  Do-do-do.
[01:44.260 --> 01:44.800]  Do-do-do.
[01:45.260 --> 01:47.380]  This camera, he's swinging.
[01:47.740 --> 01:49.700]  It's like a Cenk White Lotus intro.
[01:51.540 --> 01:52.300]  There you go.
[01:56.540 --> 01:57.760]  Look at that, that was beans.
[01:57.760 --> 01:58.580]  That's nice.
[01:58.600 --> 02:00.420]  That was a lot of beans there, buddy.
[02:00.660 --> 02:01.400]  I don't know, man.
[02:01.760 --> 02:02.660]  Too many beans for that.
[02:02.660 --> 02:03.280]  Someone's bull?
[02:03.680 --> 02:03.940]  Shut up.
[02:06.620 --> 02:08.020]  Let's do a little jump.
[02:09.860 --> 02:11.040]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.480]  Oh, I like what you're doing.
[02:13.040 --> 02:13.160]  Yes!
[02:14.180 --> 02:14.620]  Too much.
[02:14.740 --> 02:15.040]  No!
[02:16.000 --> 02:16.440]  Beautiful.
[02:16.980 --> 02:18.240]  No, the pillar!
[02:19.560 --> 02:20.340]  What am I getting?
[02:20.500 --> 02:22.980]  He gets from pillar to post.
[02:23.160 --> 02:23.960]  He's ready to go.
[02:25.700 --> 02:26.200]  Hey, it's Gavin.
[02:27.360 --> 02:28.680]  Gavin's trying to gleam the cube.
[02:28.700 --> 02:29.700]  Yep, that's it right there.
[02:30.340 --> 02:31.600]  Oh yeah, this is...
[02:31.600 --> 02:32.120]  Slam-o, baby.
[02:32.500 --> 02:32.560]  Yeah!
[02:34.180 --> 02:36.000]  Out of bounds, way to go.
[02:37.020 --> 02:39.020]  I know which Gavin we're getting in this Let's Play.
[02:39.460 --> 02:39.820]  Yep!
[02:40.800 --> 02:41.280]  What's that?
[02:41.280 --> 02:42.380]  Self-destruction.
[02:42.840 --> 02:43.700]  I'll still win.
[02:43.880 --> 02:44.880]  You don't worry about it.
[02:45.020 --> 02:45.200]  Oh.
[02:45.920 --> 02:46.220]  Oh!
[02:46.720 --> 02:47.660]  I'll still win.
[02:48.420 --> 02:48.580]  Oh.
[02:48.720 --> 02:49.460]  He's not gonna win shit.
[02:49.540 --> 02:50.080]  Watch this.
[02:53.820 --> 02:54.700]  Is that...
[02:55.480 --> 02:56.480]  Is that gonna make it?
[02:57.000 --> 02:57.400]  No.
[02:58.860 --> 02:59.260]  Close.
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.880]  I thought maybe the explosion would help me.
[03:03.160 --> 03:03.820]  Didn't do anything.
[03:05.920 --> 03:06.800]  Oh, there you go.
[03:07.160 --> 03:07.760]  Ooh, a bit of lacking.
[03:08.620 --> 03:09.200]  Uh-oh.
[03:09.260 --> 03:09.860]  Oh, too late.
[03:10.020 --> 03:10.460]  Should've used it.
[03:10.720 --> 03:11.020]  Oh.
[03:11.720 --> 03:13.600]  Oh, could he bunce Eric away?
[03:15.460 --> 03:16.340]  Trying to do that.
[03:16.520 --> 03:16.920]  Yeah!
[03:17.740 --> 03:17.860]  Oh!
[03:20.500 --> 03:20.900]  Fuck!
[03:21.440 --> 03:21.500]  You're on fire.
[03:21.840 --> 03:22.920]  Why did I think you had electricity?
[03:23.500 --> 03:23.980]  He did.
[03:24.200 --> 03:24.760]  I did.
[03:24.760 --> 03:25.220]  He did for a second.
[03:25.220 --> 03:26.240]  360 no scope.
[03:26.460 --> 03:29.460]  He had electricity, then he didn't use it.
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.020]  And then a fire.
[03:30.140 --> 03:30.860]  I picked up fire.
[03:31.680 --> 03:32.840]  He crossed into fire.
[03:33.820 --> 03:35.420]  Oh, he jumped in the fire.
[03:35.740 --> 03:35.960]  Oh!
[03:36.260 --> 03:36.640]  Oh!
[03:36.900 --> 03:39.200]  Oh, you son of a bitch!
[03:39.360 --> 03:39.920]  Wow!
[03:40.420 --> 03:40.640]  Whoops.
[03:44.160 --> 03:44.720]  Enemies!
[03:45.720 --> 03:46.280]  Enemies!
[03:48.240 --> 03:49.820]  Murderous rage is building.
[03:50.240 --> 03:52.120]  It is beginning to build.
[03:52.760 --> 03:53.620]  It was zero.
[03:53.860 --> 03:54.660]  Now it's...
[03:54.660 --> 03:56.240]  Very close to 100, just on that.
[03:57.440 --> 03:58.680]  Oh no, Gavin, no!
[03:58.760 --> 03:59.240]  Oh, that worked.
[03:59.460 --> 04:00.080]  Okay, that's good.
[04:02.260 --> 04:02.660]  Aw.
[04:05.980 --> 04:06.660]  Good shot.
[04:09.480 --> 04:10.960]  Oh my God, I'm way back here.
[04:11.040 --> 04:11.740]  Holy shit!
[04:12.100 --> 04:12.660]  This sucks.
[04:12.740 --> 04:13.860]  It was Eric who got knocked back.
[04:14.240 --> 04:14.460]  Oh!
[04:14.580 --> 04:14.780]  Yeah.
[04:15.360 --> 04:15.920]  It was the yellow ball.
[04:15.940 --> 04:16.460]  That was Geoff.
[04:16.760 --> 04:18.960]  No, I'm not the yellow ball.
[04:20.840 --> 04:21.240]  Oh!
[04:21.980 --> 04:22.380]  Oh!
[04:22.720 --> 04:22.980]  Wow!
[04:23.660 --> 04:24.180]  That's a stunt.
[04:24.700 --> 04:25.420]  I really...
[04:25.420 --> 04:27.760]  I tried to use the first fire as the stopper
[04:27.760 --> 04:28.660]  and it didn't do it.
[04:29.200 --> 04:29.840]  Geoff, get him.
[04:30.200 --> 04:31.160]  Geoff, you know what to do.
[04:31.400 --> 04:32.080]  Geoff, you idiot.
[04:32.900 --> 04:34.260]  Geoff, you're fucked.
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.320]  Geoff, you're fucked.
[04:36.300 --> 04:37.620]  Cannot believe that happened.
[04:37.840 --> 04:38.820]  Andrew, what do we have to do?
[04:38.880 --> 04:39.100]  Do it, Andrew.
[04:39.100 --> 04:39.660]  He's going for blood.
[04:39.920 --> 04:40.440]  Do it, Andrew.
[04:40.760 --> 04:42.480]  In off Geoff.
[04:45.120 --> 04:45.820]  Get in the hole!
[04:46.160 --> 04:46.760]  Get in the hole!
[04:47.640 --> 04:49.040]  Oh, and he respawned!
[04:49.840 --> 04:51.140]  Oh, you hit him out of bounds.
[04:52.600 --> 04:52.960]  Fuck!
[04:54.360 --> 04:55.780]  That was useless.
[04:56.960 --> 04:58.000]  Oh no!
[04:58.580 --> 04:59.480]  Yep, here it comes.
[04:59.760 --> 05:00.820]  Check this out.
[05:01.200 --> 05:01.440]  Yep.
[05:02.620 --> 05:02.820]  Oh!
[05:03.440 --> 05:03.960]  Now.
[05:04.240 --> 05:04.900]  Oh shit!
[05:06.900 --> 05:07.860]  No, I don't want the fire.
[05:08.060 --> 05:08.820]  I don't want the fire.
[05:09.080 --> 05:09.960]  I don't want the fire.
[05:10.500 --> 05:11.320]  Oh yeah!
[05:13.640 --> 05:15.140]  I don't want the fire.
[05:15.300 --> 05:15.720]  I don't want that.
[05:15.980 --> 05:16.660]  Don't want it?
[05:17.200 --> 05:17.640]  Oh wow.
[05:21.980 --> 05:23.020]  Well shit.
[05:24.180 --> 05:25.140]  Full gone.
[05:31.960 --> 05:33.080]  Oh no!
[05:35.780 --> 05:36.540]  Do it.
[05:37.140 --> 05:37.660]  Do it.
[05:37.880 --> 05:38.580]  Send him to hell.
[05:41.940 --> 05:42.140]  Uh oh.
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.160]  Oh dear.
[05:46.220 --> 05:46.500]  Maybe?
[05:48.040 --> 05:49.820]  That is just back to where you were.
[05:52.020 --> 05:52.980]  Oh no, that's me!
[05:53.260 --> 05:53.720]  Oh sorry.
[05:57.020 --> 05:58.540]  It's the first hole!
[05:58.720 --> 05:59.820]  It's the first hole!
[06:00.520 --> 06:02.780]  Yeah, and everyone's on even ground.
[06:03.980 --> 06:05.760]  Andrew, you know what to do.
[06:06.200 --> 06:08.180]  Andrew, you know what to do.
[06:08.520 --> 06:09.840]  I'm trying to get to you this time.
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.540]  Geoff, I'm going to try to bounce you in.
[06:12.700 --> 06:13.100]  Why?
[06:16.320 --> 06:16.720]  Shit.
[06:18.340 --> 06:19.380]  This is Geoff sinking.
[06:19.520 --> 06:20.240]  One, two, three.
[06:20.260 --> 06:20.520]  What?
[06:20.840 --> 06:21.260]  One, two, three.
[06:21.340 --> 06:21.600]  Oh!
[06:22.140 --> 06:22.640]  I'm not going to sink my audio.
[06:22.880 --> 06:23.780]  My audio stopped.
[06:24.140 --> 06:24.740]  I caught it though.
[06:24.740 --> 06:25.720]  In the hole!
[06:28.320 --> 06:30.120]  What do you do to make it stop again?
[06:30.520 --> 06:31.500]  Do you like alt tab or something?
[06:32.720 --> 06:34.200]  Unplug my headphones.
[06:34.460 --> 06:35.880]  But I didn't unplug my headphones this time.
[06:35.960 --> 06:36.520]  I don't know why it stopped.
[06:37.520 --> 06:38.400]  Double bogey.
[06:38.980 --> 06:40.880]  I don't like the idea of the software
[06:40.880 --> 06:42.560]  knowing whether I've plugged headphones in.
[06:42.900 --> 06:43.800]  I'm right there with you.
[06:44.020 --> 06:44.740]  It's not ideal.
[06:44.820 --> 06:45.780]  I'm not jazzed about it.
[06:50.220 --> 06:52.320]  What is this maneuver that you're...
[06:52.320 --> 06:53.280]  Oh, I see.
[06:53.520 --> 06:53.900]  Why?
[06:54.100 --> 06:55.080]  I didn't do anything.
[06:55.340 --> 06:56.000]  Die, die.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.120]  Oh, no, he's back.
[06:58.800 --> 07:00.760]  Wait, so you're saying don't use the electricity?
[07:02.900 --> 07:03.220]  What?
[07:03.420 --> 07:04.580]  No, use it later on the others.
[07:04.740 --> 07:05.680]  Why are we still here?
[07:11.240 --> 07:12.040]  No fire!
[07:15.580 --> 07:16.740]  The hidden flames.
[07:17.720 --> 07:19.180]  Oh, this is going to be the worst.
[07:20.080 --> 07:20.400]  Okay.
[07:30.040 --> 07:31.620]  Oh, shit.
[07:34.520 --> 07:35.920]  Where am I?
[07:43.480 --> 07:44.520]  Oh, wow.
[07:45.020 --> 07:46.240]  Oh, nevermind.
[07:46.460 --> 07:47.280]  Oh, you know what to do, Gavin.
[07:48.360 --> 07:49.580]  Oh, my God.
[07:49.720 --> 07:51.000]  Oh, my God.
[07:51.080 --> 07:52.240]  Oh, my God.
[07:52.460 --> 07:52.540]  Oh, my God.
[07:52.540 --> 07:53.400]  It's the first hole.
[07:53.980 --> 07:54.500]  Oh, my God.
[07:54.580 --> 07:55.820]  It's the first hole.
[07:56.120 --> 07:56.820]  Oh, please.
[07:57.120 --> 07:58.660]  Geoff got so far back.
[07:58.920 --> 08:00.840]  Everybody's going so far.
[08:00.960 --> 08:02.600]  It's the first hole.
[08:04.460 --> 08:05.360]  Look at it.
[08:05.860 --> 08:07.120]  Look at this shit.
[08:09.560 --> 08:10.320]  Oh, no.
[08:10.640 --> 08:11.660]  You know what to do.
[08:12.260 --> 08:12.820]  Don't do that.
[08:14.000 --> 08:14.940]  Yeah, do that.
[08:15.160 --> 08:16.640]  Retaliation is childish.
[08:18.680 --> 08:19.640]  Not retaliation.
[08:19.800 --> 08:20.320]  It's justice.
[08:20.620 --> 08:20.960]  No.
[08:24.860 --> 08:26.780]  You must've gotten blown off, right?
[08:26.860 --> 08:28.220]  Like you're going to come back right there.
[08:29.220 --> 08:30.340]  I don't think you...
[08:30.340 --> 08:31.120]  Oh, no.
[08:31.220 --> 08:31.640]  Oh, my God.
[08:31.700 --> 08:32.280]  He's in there.
[08:32.280 --> 08:33.360]  There he is.
[08:33.360 --> 08:34.160]  Oh, man.
[08:34.580 --> 08:35.540]  Even better.
[08:35.820 --> 08:36.840]  Oh, shit.
[08:37.220 --> 08:38.440]  Incredible stuff.
[08:38.900 --> 08:39.820]  Geoff, twat me out.
[08:40.060 --> 08:42.200]  It's the first hole.
[08:42.420 --> 08:43.000]  Probably not gonna.
[08:43.400 --> 08:43.680]  Okay.
[08:45.820 --> 08:46.380]  Oh.
[08:46.900 --> 08:47.720]  Oh, what?
[08:47.820 --> 08:48.320]  He got it.
[08:49.460 --> 08:49.900]  No.
[08:52.600 --> 08:54.060]  Are you fucking serious?
[08:54.240 --> 08:57.580]  They made this course with this invisible lip at the top.
[08:57.680 --> 08:58.980]  And I thought, yeah, it's great.
[08:59.080 --> 08:59.680]  It works real well.
[08:59.700 --> 09:00.000]  Bye.
[09:03.120 --> 09:04.680]  I think it's fantastic.
[09:05.080 --> 09:06.540]  I think it's dog shit.
[09:08.580 --> 09:09.780]  You see what I'm talking about?
[09:09.860 --> 09:10.620]  Off the store, huh?
[09:10.900 --> 09:11.260]  Oh, yeah.
[09:11.840 --> 09:12.300]  Oh, get me in.
[09:12.400 --> 09:12.900]  Get me in there.
[09:13.120 --> 09:13.460]  Get me in.
[09:13.740 --> 09:14.120]  Oh.
[09:17.000 --> 09:17.400]  Okay.
[09:17.600 --> 09:17.860]  Not him.
[09:18.300 --> 09:18.660]  Never him.
[09:18.660 --> 09:19.180]  All right, back.
[09:19.460 --> 09:19.740]  All right.
[09:23.500 --> 09:24.660]  Wind up perfectly.
[09:25.380 --> 09:27.100]  What camera's in the gimbal lock?
[09:27.820 --> 09:28.560]  Oh, dear.
[09:31.970 --> 09:33.610]  Oh, you twatted me there.
[09:35.430 --> 09:36.410]  Get in the hole.
[09:37.150 --> 09:37.350]  Oh.
[09:39.350 --> 09:40.690]  Right in the lip.
[09:41.030 --> 09:41.510]  Heartbreaker.
[09:41.770 --> 09:41.930]  Come on, Gavin.
[09:43.390 --> 09:44.030]  Heartbreaker.
[09:45.650 --> 09:47.570]  It just puts you in the middle.
[09:48.030 --> 09:48.790]  Oh, no.
[09:49.190 --> 09:51.570]  You guys just keep trading positions.
[09:54.630 --> 09:56.050]  Gavin's way back there again.
[09:56.750 --> 09:58.110]  Oh, what a shot.
[09:58.110 --> 09:58.650]  Oh, Geoff.
[10:07.540 --> 10:09.220]  It looks so good.
[10:09.860 --> 10:11.140]  Fucking great.
[10:11.480 --> 10:12.080]  Oh, man.
[10:18.040 --> 10:19.340]  It'll be a long day.
[10:19.880 --> 10:20.280]  Mm-hmm.
[10:27.490 --> 10:29.190]  It's so quiet already.
[10:29.530 --> 10:31.150]  Frickin' hellbacks.
[10:31.690 --> 10:33.390]  It's the first hole.
[10:34.130 --> 10:34.770]  Oh, what?
[10:35.090 --> 10:35.490]  What?
[10:35.890 --> 10:36.870]  Oh, he fired you.
[10:38.470 --> 10:39.010]  Get out.
[10:40.010 --> 10:41.610]  What the fuck?
[10:43.650 --> 10:44.450]  What happened?
[10:45.090 --> 10:45.650]  He blew you up.
[10:46.070 --> 10:48.050]  No, I know, but what happened before that?
[10:48.230 --> 10:48.690]  It like...
[10:48.690 --> 10:49.610]  He flamed me.
[10:50.210 --> 10:51.470]  I didn't have fire on.
[10:52.250 --> 10:52.970]  Well, someone did.
[10:53.570 --> 10:53.910]  What?
[10:56.050 --> 10:56.610]  Thank you.
[10:58.210 --> 10:59.150]  You deal with him.
[11:03.810 --> 11:04.850]  Oh, you went in?
[11:05.030 --> 11:06.050]  Oh, you went in.
[11:06.730 --> 11:07.990]  That guy, you went in.
[11:09.630 --> 11:10.990]  What a shot.
[11:10.990 --> 11:11.810]  Holy shit.
[11:12.390 --> 11:13.430]  What a shot.
[11:16.750 --> 11:17.770]  Get me out of here.
[11:17.970 --> 11:18.330]  Yay.
[11:18.650 --> 11:19.650]  Oh my God.
[11:21.030 --> 11:21.850]  All right, Eric.
[11:22.130 --> 11:23.490]  It's the first hole.
[11:29.930 --> 11:30.650]  Oh, nice.
[11:30.830 --> 11:31.430]  Oh, get in.
[11:31.590 --> 11:31.710]  Oh.
[11:32.150 --> 11:32.750]  Why use it?
[11:32.810 --> 11:33.390]  You could go back.
[11:33.550 --> 11:34.210]  Why not use it?
[11:34.210 --> 11:35.030]  So hopefully I touch it.
[11:35.030 --> 11:35.750]  Why not, yeah.
[11:35.890 --> 11:37.070]  You can't touch your own fire.
[11:37.450 --> 11:39.530]  Oh, that's right, you can't.
[11:39.610 --> 11:39.930]  Whatever.
[11:42.550 --> 11:44.290]  You could have fucked everyone over right out the gate
[11:44.290 --> 11:44.790]  in the next hole.
[11:45.690 --> 11:45.790]  Boop.
[11:45.790 --> 11:46.370]  I forgot.
[11:46.470 --> 11:47.410]  I thought I had the...
[11:47.410 --> 11:48.170]  I thought I could use it.
[11:48.230 --> 11:50.050]  I'm like, oh, this will be like a nice little stop for me.
[11:50.350 --> 11:51.530]  Wait, I thought it doesn't carry over.
[11:52.510 --> 11:52.990]  I thought it does.
[11:53.390 --> 11:54.370]  I'm pretty sure it does, doesn't it?
[11:54.930 --> 11:55.470]  Well, let's see.
[11:55.530 --> 11:56.810]  I think I had a bomb on me.
[11:57.070 --> 11:57.770]  Let's see if I do that.
[11:58.090 --> 11:58.990]  Nick's chatting shite.
[11:59.930 --> 12:01.410]  He doesn't even fucking play the game,
[12:01.490 --> 12:02.390]  so I don't know why he's talking.
[12:02.930 --> 12:03.710]  He's a shite chatter.
[12:04.670 --> 12:04.950]  Whoa.
[12:06.530 --> 12:07.950]  It's quite a changing vibe, isn't it?
[12:08.710 --> 12:08.990]  Yeah.
[12:12.510 --> 12:12.830]  Okay.
[12:13.350 --> 12:14.590]  Are you trying to hit it in his gob?
[12:14.870 --> 12:15.790]  I sure am.
[12:16.850 --> 12:17.950]  Ooh, it's getting hot in there, huh?
[12:21.510 --> 12:22.150]  Oh, fuck.
[12:22.250 --> 12:22.510]  Okay.
[12:22.990 --> 12:24.250]  Oh, I see what I'm supposed to do.
[12:26.450 --> 12:27.650]  You see what you're supposed to do?
[12:27.790 --> 12:28.210]  What are you supposed to do?
[12:28.230 --> 12:29.070]  Yeah, there's a little jumpy jump.
[12:31.730 --> 12:31.910]  Hit.
[12:35.150 --> 12:36.350]  Did you see what you're supposed to do?
[12:36.830 --> 12:37.150]  Yeah.
[12:38.010 --> 12:38.330]  Okay.
[12:45.390 --> 12:45.830]  Spring!
[12:46.410 --> 12:47.450]  Spring, you fool!
[12:50.550 --> 12:51.570]  Yeah, Geoff has fire.
[12:51.690 --> 12:52.590]  Geoff still has his fire.
[12:53.470 --> 12:54.110]  Oh, wow.
[12:54.770 --> 12:55.130]  That's right.
[12:55.350 --> 12:56.770]  Shit, Nick's not chatting shit.
[12:57.630 --> 12:59.270]  Nick's not a shit chatter.
[12:59.870 --> 13:00.070]  What?
[13:00.750 --> 13:01.370]  Not this round.
[13:01.590 --> 13:01.910]  You shouldn't.
[13:01.970 --> 13:03.030]  Ah, fuck.
[13:03.110 --> 13:03.930]  I don't want to do this.
[13:08.610 --> 13:10.350]  Why did you do that angle?
[13:15.950 --> 13:18.970]  Well, well, well, if it isn't the idiot.
[13:20.870 --> 13:22.730]  If it isn't old Geoff.
[13:23.030 --> 13:23.490]  There it is.
[13:23.730 --> 13:24.130]  Bam!
[13:24.910 --> 13:25.630]  It's in the hole.
[13:25.910 --> 13:26.310]  What?
[13:26.650 --> 13:28.050]  Oh my God, it's in the hole.
[13:28.410 --> 13:28.990]  What the god damn?
[13:29.150 --> 13:29.790]  It's an Indiana Jones shit.
[13:30.150 --> 13:30.550]  Beautiful.
[13:31.010 --> 13:31.670]  It's in the hole.
[13:32.750 --> 13:33.090]  Dodo!
[13:36.510 --> 13:38.010]  What the hell's a dodo?
[13:39.270 --> 13:39.770]  Dodo bird.
[13:40.750 --> 13:41.690]  What's the par here?
[13:41.790 --> 13:43.730]  Probably like par five and he got that in like two.
[13:43.730 --> 13:45.510]  I thought ostrich was next.
[13:46.590 --> 13:47.030]  Ostrich?
[13:47.550 --> 13:48.590]  Yeah, isn't that a golf thing?
[13:49.630 --> 13:51.410]  It's a bird, I don't think so, is it?
[13:51.410 --> 13:52.810]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[13:52.970 --> 13:53.330]  Shit!
[13:54.030 --> 13:55.570]  You can't get ostrich in golf?
[13:56.350 --> 13:59.270]  No, I think it's birdie equals albatross.
[13:59.890 --> 14:00.450]  Yeah, but then what?
[14:00.950 --> 14:02.290]  I don't know, dodo I guess.
[14:02.590 --> 14:03.610]  I don't know, not possible?
[14:03.870 --> 14:04.090]  Ogie?
[14:04.530 --> 14:04.730]  Yeah.
[14:05.890 --> 14:06.490]  Hole in one?
[14:07.610 --> 14:08.730]  It's in the hole.
[14:09.470 --> 14:10.710]  It's in the hole!
[14:13.070 --> 14:14.270]  See what kind of bird I get?
[14:14.410 --> 14:15.070]  What kind of bird is it, Gavin?
[14:16.130 --> 14:17.210]  It's a dodo, bitch.
[14:20.230 --> 14:21.110]  Good girl!
[14:22.190 --> 14:24.130]  It's a dodo, bitch.
[14:29.670 --> 14:30.290]  Oh, Geoff.
[14:30.370 --> 14:32.510]  All right, Geoff is doing it.
[14:34.050 --> 14:34.810]  I'm committed.
[14:35.330 --> 14:36.350]  You are, it's true.
[14:36.770 --> 14:40.470]  It was either this or it was 11 strokes of this.
[14:43.610 --> 14:46.410]  I feel like Gavin's been standing here for a day.
[14:46.510 --> 14:46.590]  It's in the hole!
[14:46.950 --> 14:47.630]  Way to go!
[14:48.310 --> 14:49.290]  Man, what are you doing?
[14:49.290 --> 14:49.630]  I don't know how I'm...
[14:49.630 --> 14:50.770]  I'm trying to sprig!
[14:51.650 --> 14:53.690]  Mr. Beans isn't going full beans.
[14:54.230 --> 14:54.790]  Yeah, I don't know.
[14:55.190 --> 14:56.350]  Why even talk to him about it, Geoff?
[14:56.570 --> 14:56.970]  Geoff.
[14:57.690 --> 14:58.790]  Geoff, use the angle.
[14:59.450 --> 14:59.870]  Geoff.
[14:59.930 --> 15:01.570]  The angle hasn't helped him so far.
[15:02.110 --> 15:02.310]  Geoff!
[15:02.310 --> 15:03.370]  How's the angle gonna help me?
[15:04.090 --> 15:04.350]  Okay.
[15:07.810 --> 15:08.650]  This is...
[15:10.750 --> 15:11.310]  Geoff.
[15:12.130 --> 15:13.710]  You're making me stressed.
[15:14.210 --> 15:16.090]  You're giving me anxiety.
[15:16.770 --> 15:17.330]  Geoff!
[15:17.730 --> 15:18.110]  No!
[15:20.750 --> 15:24.290]  All of that to avoid the fire that you can't avoid anyway.
[15:27.990 --> 15:29.170]  Full beans, Gavin.
[15:31.670 --> 15:33.330]  A little less beans, Gavin.
[15:33.370 --> 15:34.770]  I would've said a little less beans, I guess.
[15:37.290 --> 15:37.850]  Geoff.
[15:38.830 --> 15:39.390]  Geoff!
[15:39.950 --> 15:41.750]  No, I'm just lining myself up.
[15:42.010 --> 15:42.210]  Yeah.
[15:43.030 --> 15:44.310]  He's ready for next time.
[15:45.390 --> 15:47.370]  Instead of taking an ill-conceived, unleg...
[15:47.370 --> 15:47.510]  Go!
[15:50.970 --> 15:51.850]  Get in the mouth!
[15:51.890 --> 15:52.570]  There you go!
[15:53.170 --> 15:54.090]  In the hole!
[15:54.450 --> 15:54.950]  You did it!
[15:56.410 --> 15:57.170]  You did it!
[15:57.230 --> 15:58.070]  Ain't no dodo.
[15:58.490 --> 16:00.370]  What type of messed up bird is he gonna get?
[16:00.970 --> 16:01.170]  Par.
[16:01.310 --> 16:02.410]  What kind of bird is that?
[16:02.450 --> 16:02.870]  Oh, hey!
[16:04.110 --> 16:04.510]  Kapar!
[16:07.690 --> 16:08.090]  Kapar!
[16:08.810 --> 16:10.730]  Oh, God, I have a long way to go.
[16:12.070 --> 16:13.830]  And a short time to get there.
[16:14.030 --> 16:14.210]  Nope.
[16:14.510 --> 16:15.290]  That's not gonna do it.
[16:16.290 --> 16:17.290]  Oh, maybe, maybe...
[16:20.790 --> 16:21.150]  Oh!
[16:24.810 --> 16:25.490]  That's what I'm talking about.
[16:29.270 --> 16:31.570]  I feel like it's so much harder to do it
[16:31.570 --> 16:32.770]  the way that you're currently doing it.
[16:32.990 --> 16:33.350]  Yeah!
[16:33.690 --> 16:34.230]  Seems to be.
[16:34.450 --> 16:35.370]  Well, he can't go full beans,
[16:35.490 --> 16:36.130]  because it'll fly over.
[16:36.270 --> 16:37.110]  Yeah, exactly.
[16:37.110 --> 16:38.710]  And now it's coming back down again.
[16:38.710 --> 16:39.610]  Oh, wait, wait, no!
[16:39.930 --> 16:41.010]  We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[16:41.110 --> 16:41.350]  Oh!
[16:42.430 --> 16:42.990]  Uh-oh.
[16:43.290 --> 16:44.990]  Look how far away the hole is.
[16:46.650 --> 16:46.950]  Okay.
[16:48.210 --> 16:49.510]  What's that thing in the middle there?
[16:49.970 --> 16:50.770]  Oh, that was a different hole.
[16:52.050 --> 16:52.770]  Probably a ball.
[16:52.890 --> 16:54.050]  Oh, it might be a free.
[16:55.070 --> 16:55.830]  I believe it is.
[16:56.350 --> 16:57.890]  Nope, that's not gonna do it.
[16:58.210 --> 16:59.830]  It's a full beans situation.
[17:00.070 --> 17:00.210]  Yeah.
[17:00.590 --> 17:01.350]  Good to know.
[17:01.830 --> 17:02.450]  Max beans.
[17:03.230 --> 17:03.990]  Max beans!
[17:05.090 --> 17:05.690]  Missed that.
[17:05.710 --> 17:06.330]  Did he get it?
[17:06.330 --> 17:06.610]  Nice.
[17:06.610 --> 17:07.150]  He's in though.
[17:07.330 --> 17:07.430]  Hey!
[17:08.190 --> 17:08.590]  Oh!
[17:08.830 --> 17:10.370]  Oh, here it comes.
[17:10.670 --> 17:11.210]  Stay in the course.
[17:12.070 --> 17:12.450]  Oh, no.
[17:12.710 --> 17:14.690]  Oh, oh, oh, scorpion!
[17:14.870 --> 17:15.290]  Son of a bitch.
[17:15.430 --> 17:16.290]  A little scorp-nudge.
[17:19.410 --> 17:20.230]  It's in the hole.
[17:20.730 --> 17:20.950]  Yeah!
[17:21.330 --> 17:21.410]  Yeah, Geoff!
[17:21.410 --> 17:22.030]  What kind of bird are you?
[17:22.130 --> 17:22.890]  Plus five bird?
[17:22.910 --> 17:23.510]  What kind of bird is that?
[17:24.210 --> 17:25.830]  All right, that one could have gone better for me.
[17:26.110 --> 17:27.530]  God, he's over here too?
[17:29.010 --> 17:29.810]  Oh, piss.
[17:30.550 --> 17:31.810]  Oh, he followed you, look.
[17:32.030 --> 17:32.550]  God damn.
[17:34.710 --> 17:35.630]  What's this about?
[17:35.630 --> 17:36.490]  Super spring?
[17:37.190 --> 17:37.250]  Yep.
[17:38.370 --> 17:39.290]  Or just spring.
[17:39.450 --> 17:40.210]  It'll make everyone jump.
[17:40.910 --> 17:42.230]  Yeah, it might make everyone jump.
[17:46.070 --> 17:47.110]  Nice shot.
[17:48.070 --> 17:49.810]  Oh, oh, oh, no.
[17:51.050 --> 17:51.330]  Okay.
[17:52.190 --> 17:53.150]  Yeah, it kind of worked out.
[17:54.010 --> 17:54.650]  What's down the hill?
[18:00.790 --> 18:01.610]  Gonna use the jump.
[18:03.030 --> 18:03.910]  Here it goes!
[18:05.170 --> 18:05.690]  Oh!
[18:05.710 --> 18:06.230]  Oh!
[18:07.190 --> 18:07.690]  Good try.
[18:07.690 --> 18:09.910]  You have to be mindful of the jump.
[18:11.130 --> 18:11.930]  That's crazy.
[18:12.930 --> 18:14.870]  Geoff is not going to try it.
[18:15.190 --> 18:15.890]  Mm-hmm.
[18:24.280 --> 18:25.220]  Here we go.
[18:25.220 --> 18:25.740]  Here we go!
[18:26.460 --> 18:27.580]  Look at these beans.
[18:28.120 --> 18:28.760]  Oh, there's a little hole there.
[18:28.760 --> 18:30.320]  Oh, there's like a little middle situation too.
[18:30.420 --> 18:30.780]  Interesting.
[18:31.080 --> 18:31.360]  Is that good all?
[18:31.360 --> 18:32.200]  A bomb!
[18:33.520 --> 18:33.900]  Oh.
[18:34.020 --> 18:34.900]  I'll just hang out right here.
[18:35.120 --> 18:35.500]  Okay.
[18:36.320 --> 18:37.080]  Nice and safe.
[18:37.880 --> 18:38.940]  Andrew, what are you thinking here?
[18:38.980 --> 18:39.820]  What are you thinking for this hole?
[18:41.420 --> 18:45.380]  I'm thinking I'm going to go full beans into the wall
[18:45.380 --> 18:47.080]  and do the little jump thing that you did.
[18:47.420 --> 18:47.500]  Okay.
[18:50.080 --> 18:50.900]  Let's see.
[18:51.640 --> 18:53.100]  I just think you should be like,
[18:53.180 --> 18:54.660]  where you jump matters apparently.
[18:54.960 --> 18:55.420]  Yeah.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.880]  Just like real life.
[18:57.880 --> 19:00.320]  Just like real life.
[19:00.400 --> 19:01.540]  I've been saying this.
[19:02.840 --> 19:03.460]  Oh!
[19:03.620 --> 19:04.240]  Oh!
[19:04.240 --> 19:05.340]  The timing was important.
[19:06.460 --> 19:07.040]  Oh!
[19:07.040 --> 19:07.400]  Oh!
[19:08.240 --> 19:09.420]  Holy shit!
[19:09.420 --> 19:10.900]  That was so lucky!
[19:12.360 --> 19:13.140]  Scorpion, get him!
[19:13.140 --> 19:14.360]  Push me in, Scorpio!
[19:14.940 --> 19:16.080]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[19:16.740 --> 19:17.420]  Mother goddamn.
[19:17.800 --> 19:18.320]  Scorpio, you're talking about.
[19:18.320 --> 19:18.880]  Shoot down the middle, no?
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.880]  Like, cause it's the cool thing?
[19:22.040 --> 19:22.240]  No?
[19:22.340 --> 19:23.420]  Yeah, but I got springy.
[19:23.540 --> 19:24.220]  Yeah, you got it.
[19:24.240 --> 19:24.700]  Hit it, baby.
[19:24.880 --> 19:25.340]  Let's go.
[19:26.000 --> 19:26.660]  One springy dingy.
[19:26.660 --> 19:27.260]  Way to go!
[19:28.200 --> 19:28.920]  Good spring!
[19:30.180 --> 19:31.200]  What, it used it?
[19:31.200 --> 19:32.180]  Now you got a good run-up.
[19:32.580 --> 19:32.760]  What?
[19:32.880 --> 19:33.740]  And you used it!
[19:34.060 --> 19:35.780]  Did anyone see it spring?
[19:35.780 --> 19:35.900]  Big?
[19:38.640 --> 19:40.080]  Eric, you know what would be really funny?
[19:41.080 --> 19:41.580]  Ah, nevermind.
[19:43.320 --> 19:44.200]  What happened?
[19:44.560 --> 19:45.200]  That was funny.
[19:45.520 --> 19:46.340]  You didn't time it.
[19:46.500 --> 19:47.240]  Didn't time it right.
[19:47.460 --> 19:48.460]  No, I was crazy.
[19:48.680 --> 19:49.300]  There's nothing to time.
[19:49.440 --> 19:49.820]  That was nuts.
[19:49.820 --> 19:50.240]  Why am I back here?
[19:50.540 --> 19:52.180]  Oh, you must've got lit on fire.
[19:52.640 --> 19:53.740]  No, I didn't.
[19:54.580 --> 19:56.040]  Geoff, we got a full sheet of this.
[19:56.580 --> 19:57.720]  No, I didn't.
[20:00.400 --> 20:03.820]  I think maybe, I think maybe you did.
[20:04.340 --> 20:05.160]  But he didn't.
[20:05.160 --> 20:06.220]  We didn't even see that happen.
[20:06.300 --> 20:06.660]  I saw it too.
[20:06.740 --> 20:07.840]  It wasn't even next to the fire.
[20:07.980 --> 20:08.360]  No!
[20:08.500 --> 20:09.180]  Look, I'm not there.
[20:09.320 --> 20:09.440]  Look!
[20:10.260 --> 20:12.520]  Maybe my shitty jump burned you up.
[20:12.740 --> 20:15.440]  Oh God.
[20:16.180 --> 20:16.220]  Ah!
[20:19.480 --> 20:19.960]  Fuck.
[20:21.360 --> 20:21.840]  Fuck.
[20:22.100 --> 20:24.040]  Oh, that was fire bullshit!
[20:24.380 --> 20:25.660]  That's such bullshit!
[20:25.900 --> 20:26.680]  Oh, hell yeah.
[20:26.960 --> 20:27.140]  No!
[20:27.900 --> 20:28.220]  No!
[20:29.780 --> 20:30.260]  Incredible.
[20:30.700 --> 20:32.200]  You deserve nothing less.
[20:32.200 --> 20:32.520]  Yeah.
[20:34.360 --> 20:35.620]  I'm going for a full power-up.
[20:35.620 --> 20:36.340]  What the hell is this angle?
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.880]  I mean, that'll, that'll lie.
[20:43.400 --> 20:43.540]  No.
[20:44.060 --> 20:45.280]  Oh, no, no, whoa.
[20:45.620 --> 20:46.520]  This game.
[20:46.700 --> 20:47.120]  That's rough.
[20:47.620 --> 20:48.820]  This game.
[20:50.200 --> 20:50.680]  Whoopsie.
[20:55.000 --> 20:55.480]  Sproing.
[20:56.200 --> 20:56.680]  Oh!
[20:56.860 --> 20:57.260]  Nailed it.
[20:57.480 --> 20:57.760]  Nice.
[20:58.220 --> 20:58.660]  Oh, you did it!
[20:58.740 --> 20:59.480]  You've done it!
[20:59.580 --> 21:00.440]  In the vacuum hole!
[21:00.440 --> 21:00.780]  In the vacuum hole.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.660]  Am I gonna get close enough?
[21:03.020 --> 21:03.880]  No, you're good.
[21:04.460 --> 21:05.680]  Oh, it's already activated!
[21:05.680 --> 21:07.080]  I didn't even have to do it!
[21:07.240 --> 21:07.460]  Yeah!
[21:07.680 --> 21:09.300]  I'm a little birdie!
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.840]  You got sucked real good.
[21:23.350 --> 21:24.150]  Oh, no.
[21:24.430 --> 21:24.870]  Geoff.
[21:26.270 --> 21:27.210]  Oh my God.
[21:31.510 --> 21:32.790]  Why are you back here?
[21:33.370 --> 21:34.610]  I don't know what to do,
[21:34.670 --> 21:37.630]  because if I go far, I get shot up.
[21:38.270 --> 21:40.310]  Just don't do it as hard, man.
[21:40.410 --> 21:40.910]  Come on.
[21:40.910 --> 21:41.570]  Yeah, well then what?
[21:41.670 --> 21:42.670]  I'm gonna plop in some hole?
[21:43.350 --> 21:43.710]  Yeah!
[21:43.990 --> 21:44.870]  What's the game?
[21:44.890 --> 21:45.790]  Yeah, the hole.
[21:46.290 --> 21:47.330]  It's how golf works.
[21:48.830 --> 21:49.530]  What am I gonna do?
[21:49.590 --> 21:50.790]  Hit this ball down the field
[21:50.790 --> 21:52.470]  and try to get it in that hole down there?
[21:55.370 --> 21:55.730]  Yeah.
[21:58.410 --> 21:59.630]  All right, Geoff, you got this one.
[21:59.690 --> 22:00.790]  Angles, baby, angles.
[22:01.510 --> 22:03.030]  Yeah, but you could do the funniest thing right now.
[22:03.550 --> 22:04.050]  It's true.
[22:07.370 --> 22:08.630]  He's really thinking about it.
[22:09.270 --> 22:09.630]  I know.
[22:12.310 --> 22:13.170]  There you go.
[22:13.190 --> 22:13.610]  Yes!
[22:14.730 --> 22:15.290]  Uh-oh.
[22:15.530 --> 22:15.850]  Uh-oh.
[22:17.330 --> 22:17.770]  Why?
[22:21.890 --> 22:22.330]  Why?
[22:22.910 --> 22:24.210]  I don't like this game anymore.
[22:24.350 --> 22:26.310]  You know you wanna launch into that mouth.
[22:27.230 --> 22:28.210]  Also, I never liked this game.
[22:28.210 --> 22:28.670]  What does that mean?
[22:28.890 --> 22:29.850]  Go in the mouth!
[22:33.090 --> 22:33.530]  How?
[22:35.170 --> 22:36.070]  In what world?
[22:36.730 --> 22:37.470]  What happened?
[22:37.750 --> 22:38.470]  How'd you do that?
[22:38.670 --> 22:39.770]  Bounced over the golf.
[22:40.410 --> 22:40.630]  What?
[22:41.170 --> 22:42.290]  Oh my God.
[22:43.870 --> 22:44.430]  Golfed it.
[22:45.250 --> 22:46.110]  You're a gob, man.
[22:46.670 --> 22:47.710]  It's the gob-a-goo.
[22:49.170 --> 22:49.910]  Gob-a-goo.
[22:50.050 --> 22:50.710]  It's the gob-a-goo.
[22:50.710 --> 22:51.810]  What are you saying?
[22:52.250 --> 22:53.390]  There's something wrong with Gavin, guys.
[22:53.430 --> 22:54.090]  Gob-a-goo.
[22:56.110 --> 22:57.450]  Blow up the scorpion.
[22:58.150 --> 23:00.290]  What's wrong with your gob-a-goo?
[23:02.950 --> 23:04.330]  You're not gonna believe this guy.
[23:04.550 --> 23:07.150]  He said he's gonna hit this ball down that track
[23:07.150 --> 23:09.130]  in as few hits as possible.
[23:10.390 --> 23:10.710]  Insane.
[23:12.510 --> 23:13.150]  You suck.
[23:13.770 --> 23:15.130]  Gavin, stop going for the mouth.
[23:15.350 --> 23:15.770]  It's just nothing.
[23:16.010 --> 23:17.350]  But it's got gob steam.
[23:17.370 --> 23:19.590]  Why is he going for the wrong mouth over here?
[23:20.150 --> 23:21.250]  It's a distraction.
[23:21.730 --> 23:22.110]  Is that it?
[23:22.370 --> 23:23.190]  Does it do anything?
[23:24.030 --> 23:25.910]  I think maybe if you get on that middle platform.
[23:25.910 --> 23:26.650]  Oh wow, that was really hard.
[23:27.410 --> 23:27.730]  Oh!
[23:28.710 --> 23:30.010]  Oh, that might be coming back.
[23:30.610 --> 23:30.850]  Nope.
[23:31.010 --> 23:32.010]  Damn, that was close, Geoff.
[23:32.630 --> 23:33.150]  That was a good shot.
[23:33.870 --> 23:34.250]  Thank you.
[23:37.780 --> 23:38.520]  Get over there.
[23:39.860 --> 23:40.480]  There you go.
[23:40.620 --> 23:41.360]  There it is!
[23:47.820 --> 23:49.800]  All right, now Geoff, you know what you have to do.
[23:49.980 --> 23:51.440]  Geoff, you know what you do.
[23:51.620 --> 23:52.580]  You know what to do.
[23:55.300 --> 23:56.000]  Is that the bomb?
[23:56.280 --> 23:56.460]  Oh.
[23:56.880 --> 23:57.060]  Pew.
[23:57.920 --> 23:58.460]  I tried to.
[24:03.640 --> 24:04.000]  Oh.
[24:09.180 --> 24:09.820]  Suck.
[24:13.180 --> 24:15.440]  All right, here comes the comeback.
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.500]  All right.
[24:17.040 --> 24:17.820]  Here it comes!
[24:17.840 --> 24:19.060]  That was the second hole.
[24:19.840 --> 24:20.260]  Third.
[24:20.460 --> 24:20.920]  That was the third.
[24:20.960 --> 24:21.480]  What was it?
[24:21.760 --> 24:21.920]  Ugh.
[24:22.640 --> 24:23.600]  They all feel the same.
[24:24.700 --> 24:25.340]  Ooh.
[24:25.860 --> 24:26.940]  This is nice.
[24:27.440 --> 24:28.080]  Pretty.
[24:31.540 --> 24:31.860]  Ooh.
[24:33.380 --> 24:34.420]  Lucky ball.
[24:35.100 --> 24:35.700]  Drawbridge.
[24:41.060 --> 24:41.540]  Oh.
[24:42.440 --> 24:42.920]  Oh!
[24:43.380 --> 24:43.860]  Oh.
[24:44.300 --> 24:44.660]  What?
[24:45.460 --> 24:45.940]  Oh.
[24:49.840 --> 24:52.980]  Wow, you played that so perfectly and it fucked you.
[24:53.360 --> 24:56.160]  I don't know what else are you supposed to do?
[24:57.240 --> 24:57.720]  Better.
[24:59.260 --> 24:59.700]  Oh, yeah.
[24:59.800 --> 25:01.300]  See, I didn't play that perfectly at all.
[25:02.820 --> 25:04.500]  Oh, how am I gonna get past?
[25:06.360 --> 25:07.220]  Oh, no.
[25:07.500 --> 25:08.960]  Is that just gonna bing me?
[25:08.960 --> 25:09.280]  Is that just gonna bing me off?
[25:11.120 --> 25:11.680]  No!
[25:12.260 --> 25:12.940]  I don't know if we'll find out.
[25:12.940 --> 25:13.600]  She's gonna get binged off.
[25:13.600 --> 25:15.680]  We'll find out with Andrew first.
[25:16.400 --> 25:16.940]  Yeah, let's...
[25:16.940 --> 25:17.400]  No!
[25:18.360 --> 25:19.340]  Oh, God, please.
[25:19.860 --> 25:20.940]  Oh, let this work.
[25:21.160 --> 25:23.320]  Please be real and please make this happen.
[25:23.940 --> 25:24.780]  Let this work.
[25:24.980 --> 25:25.660]  Oh, God.
[25:25.660 --> 25:26.060]  No!
[25:30.760 --> 25:32.680]  I couldn't do anything.
[25:35.840 --> 25:36.080]  Oh.
[25:37.200 --> 25:37.760]  Incredible.
[25:39.360 --> 25:39.680]  Oh!
[25:48.940 --> 25:49.860]  Birdie should have been an eagle,
[25:49.960 --> 25:50.660]  should have been a hole in one,
[25:50.780 --> 25:51.540]  shouldn't even be here.
[25:53.900 --> 25:54.720]  This should be Nick.
[25:55.160 --> 25:55.480]  Incredible.
[25:55.640 --> 25:56.200]  Yeah, no kidding.
[25:58.140 --> 25:58.460]  What?
[25:59.260 --> 25:59.900]  Ooh, drawbridge.
[26:00.260 --> 26:01.340]  I think the drawbridge is cool.
[26:03.100 --> 26:03.720]  I don't know.
[26:06.080 --> 26:07.500]  What do you think it looks like in there, Geoff?
[26:07.540 --> 26:08.040]  Go for it.
[26:08.960 --> 26:10.600]  I bet I could get in it.
[26:10.840 --> 26:11.280]  How?
[26:12.880 --> 26:13.540]  From here?
[26:13.720 --> 26:13.860]  Yeah, show us.
[26:14.760 --> 26:16.620]  Do you think there's angles you could use?
[26:16.760 --> 26:17.360]  Probably not.
[26:17.900 --> 26:18.680]  No, I don't think so.
[26:18.680 --> 26:19.080]  Not me.
[26:19.220 --> 26:20.180]  Maybe somebody else's angles.
[26:21.280 --> 26:22.840]  I don't think I have the angles.
[26:23.080 --> 26:24.460]  Yeah, this is so good.
[26:25.520 --> 26:25.680]  Oh.
[26:26.200 --> 26:26.820]  No, no.
[26:28.020 --> 26:29.440]  That was a little too much.
[26:30.500 --> 26:31.340]  A little too much.
[26:32.220 --> 26:33.300]  Gotta be careful with that.
[26:33.660 --> 26:34.580]  This is so good.
[26:39.040 --> 26:39.460]  Go!
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.100]  Didn't make any sense.
[26:43.860 --> 26:45.140]  Why didn't you activate your power?
[26:45.320 --> 26:46.540]  Oh, you should activate your power.
[26:47.660 --> 26:48.020]  Yeah.
[26:49.300 --> 26:50.780]  All right, Gavin, you gotta play the angles.
[26:51.400 --> 26:52.600]  Yeah, play the angles, Gav.
[26:52.840 --> 26:54.920]  There they are, the angles, moron.
[26:56.280 --> 26:56.920]  Use your power.
[26:57.520 --> 26:58.700]  You still don't have the angle.
[26:59.200 --> 27:00.020]  I got angled out.
[27:00.440 --> 27:01.080]  Geoff, you know what to do.
[27:01.180 --> 27:01.620]  Wait, don't I?
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.200]  Geoff, send him to the crabs.
[27:06.340 --> 27:07.780]  Oh, oh, oh!
[27:07.840 --> 27:08.120]  Oh!
[27:08.120 --> 27:08.540]  Oh!
[27:10.200 --> 27:11.940]  I just hooked him up, he's set now.
[27:12.140 --> 27:12.320]  Yep.
[27:13.040 --> 27:13.680]  Oh, shit.
[27:21.060 --> 27:23.420]  Parrot looks like he's part of my crew in the background.
[27:25.600 --> 27:26.580]  You got this, Gav.
[27:28.160 --> 27:28.820]  Oh, shit.
[27:30.560 --> 27:30.960]  Go!
[27:31.660 --> 27:32.060]  No!
[27:35.420 --> 27:36.160]  Plop me in.
[27:36.920 --> 27:37.180]  Hey!
[27:38.240 --> 27:38.640]  Ha!
[27:46.000 --> 27:46.860]  Did I get disconnected?
[27:47.120 --> 27:47.260]  What happened?
[27:48.160 --> 27:48.520]  What?
[27:48.820 --> 27:49.280]  What do you mean?
[27:49.620 --> 27:50.740]  It's just showing like an ethernet.
[27:50.780 --> 27:51.400]  Dude, it just froze on you for a while.
[27:51.560 --> 27:52.000]  Oh, really?
[27:52.800 --> 27:54.140]  Are you still here or no?
[27:54.540 --> 27:55.520]  No, I mean, yeah.
[27:56.220 --> 27:56.540]  What?
[27:57.260 --> 27:57.620]  What?
[27:59.320 --> 27:59.680]  Sure.
[28:00.720 --> 28:01.820]  What the fuck?
[28:03.200 --> 28:04.520]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[28:04.560 --> 28:05.020]  Oh, no.
[28:05.860 --> 28:06.860]  You got the power out of that?
[28:07.760 --> 28:08.140]  Oh, Geoff.
[28:08.160 --> 28:08.700]  Are you fucking kidding?
[28:08.940 --> 28:10.680]  Yeah, there's no one to use it on, but you have it.
[28:11.240 --> 28:12.260]  Oh, same for the next hole.
[28:12.420 --> 28:13.820]  Are you fucking Geoffing me right now?
[28:14.520 --> 28:16.720]  You know, you could do the start of the next hole, Geoff.
[28:16.780 --> 28:19.400]  You could just roll slightly forward and then turn it on.
[28:21.820 --> 28:24.320]  Yeah, he's going to turn it on right here.
[28:25.100 --> 28:26.500]  I didn't do that.
[28:26.580 --> 28:29.260]  First of all, the game just fucking decided to go.
[28:29.380 --> 28:30.760]  My finger was held down still.
[28:30.980 --> 28:32.420]  I can't believe Nintendo did that.
[28:33.480 --> 28:34.900]  Well, this is...
[28:34.900 --> 28:37.260]  I wonder if you could just hit straight at the hole from here.
[28:37.620 --> 28:37.880]  Yeah.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.220]  Oh, nice shot, Geoff!
[28:44.620 --> 28:46.140]  Geoff, that was beautiful.
[28:46.300 --> 28:47.480]  Shut up.
[28:48.520 --> 28:49.500]  Sorry, Nick.
[28:49.520 --> 28:51.360]  Sorry, I shouldn't take out my frustrations on you.
[28:51.620 --> 28:52.320]  Very kind of you.
[28:52.760 --> 28:54.260]  I know it wasn't sarcastic.
[28:54.780 --> 28:56.140]  It wasn't at all.
[28:57.300 --> 28:58.900]  I was genuinely impressed.
[28:59.260 --> 29:00.480]  Crazy shit.
[29:01.020 --> 29:02.240]  I know, Nick. I'm sorry.
[29:02.740 --> 29:03.400]  That's all right.
[29:03.820 --> 29:04.320]  All right, Geoff.
[29:04.840 --> 29:07.160]  Oh, Geoff, just take a little tap and then hit the...
[29:10.340 --> 29:11.220]  Like, uh...
[29:11.220 --> 29:11.720]  Like this?
[29:11.720 --> 29:13.180]  Oh, my God.
[29:13.200 --> 29:14.480]  Don't be next. Don't be next.
[29:14.780 --> 29:15.120]  Fuck!
[29:16.740 --> 29:17.180]  Again!
[29:20.320 --> 29:21.200]  Blast him, Andrew.
[29:23.640 --> 29:24.520]  Might as well.
[29:24.920 --> 29:26.040]  Might as well take it with you.
[29:26.140 --> 29:26.320]  Yep.
[29:26.500 --> 29:27.280]  Just aim for the hole.
[29:29.540 --> 29:29.820]  Whoa!
[29:32.020 --> 29:33.280]  You didn't aim for the hole.
[29:34.480 --> 29:35.140]  Where's Geoff?
[29:36.460 --> 29:38.200]  I was waiting for the game to hit!
[29:39.360 --> 29:40.260]  Blast him, Gavin.
[29:41.000 --> 29:41.620]  Annihilate him.
[29:41.640 --> 29:42.800]  Send him to hell, Gavin!
[29:43.220 --> 29:45.040]  And then I'm going to go fling it backwards, probably.
[29:45.420 --> 29:47.020]  Oh, it's downhill. Look.
[29:47.380 --> 29:48.500]  OK, you and me, Geoff.
[29:50.180 --> 29:50.640]  Oh.
[29:52.220 --> 29:53.180]  Oh, what?
[29:53.460 --> 29:54.720]  Oh, man.
[29:55.140 --> 29:56.440]  I wonder where Geoff wound up.
[29:57.200 --> 29:57.980]  He's gone.
[29:59.820 --> 30:00.640]  Do you think he went somewhere?
[30:00.860 --> 30:01.420]  I'm somewhere.
[30:03.680 --> 30:04.400]  Come on.
[30:04.900 --> 30:07.500]  I think Nick just clued me into a new tactic.
[30:07.840 --> 30:08.660]  I think so.
[30:10.280 --> 30:11.540]  Come on, here we go.
[30:11.680 --> 30:12.360]  Metal, metal, metal!
[30:13.440 --> 30:13.760]  Yes!
[30:14.080 --> 30:15.060]  Wait, wait, wait.
[30:15.280 --> 30:15.800]  Get hit by the door.
[30:16.120 --> 30:16.440]  Open, open.
[30:17.020 --> 30:17.220]  Yes!
[30:18.340 --> 30:18.660]  Oh.
[30:19.220 --> 30:20.040]  Is that what you wanted?
[30:20.660 --> 30:21.380]  I don't know.
[30:23.140 --> 30:23.920]  Me and the bird.
[30:23.960 --> 30:25.180]  Yeah, it looks kind of like it, actually.
[30:25.300 --> 30:25.840]  Me and the bird.
[30:26.460 --> 30:27.400]  Son of a...
[30:28.380 --> 30:28.700]  Wow.
[30:30.520 --> 30:30.840]  This...
[30:30.840 --> 30:31.620]  It's coming up, Eric.
[30:32.600 --> 30:33.300]  Oh, there's Geoff.
[30:34.080 --> 30:35.160]  Oh, there's Geoff.
[30:35.300 --> 30:36.260]  Can I pause for just a second, guys?
[30:36.280 --> 30:36.560]  I'm sorry.
[30:37.460 --> 30:38.100]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[30:38.180 --> 30:38.860]  Just, I'll be right back.
[30:39.340 --> 30:42.200]  It's his fucking dildo delivery.
[30:44.140 --> 30:44.620]  Fucking...
[30:44.620 --> 30:46.100]  H is back, baby.
[30:46.580 --> 30:47.020]  Fuck yeah.
[30:47.420 --> 30:47.980]  We got him.
[30:49.060 --> 30:51.060]  I think we got a lot of our dildos nicked.
[30:52.600 --> 30:57.420]  I know he didn't do it on purpose, but it is such a Geoff move to decide he needed to go on his turn.
[30:57.960 --> 30:58.560]  Of course!
[30:58.980 --> 31:00.000]  Of course.
[31:02.720 --> 31:03.900]  There it is.
[31:04.060 --> 31:04.660]  Yeah, 100%.
[31:04.660 --> 31:06.560]  He's making us all wait.
[31:06.560 --> 31:07.400]  Uh-huh.
[31:07.440 --> 31:09.320]  Yeah, he could have just gone really quick.
[31:09.800 --> 31:10.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:10.740 --> 31:11.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[31:11.940 --> 31:12.300]  Yeah.
[31:14.720 --> 31:15.840]  Well into the next turn.
[31:15.920 --> 31:17.120]  He didn't even have to go far.
[31:17.140 --> 31:19.400]  He could have just put himself in front of you again or whatever.
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.840]  It could have been like a really small move.
[31:22.000 --> 31:22.840]  What am I doing over here?
[31:26.340 --> 31:26.880]  Oh, hey, Geoff.
[31:26.880 --> 31:27.360]  It's your turn.
[31:27.960 --> 31:28.160]  Yeah.
[31:29.780 --> 31:30.960]  What's all the laughter about?
[31:31.720 --> 31:32.300]  Oh, nothing.
[31:33.220 --> 31:35.660]  We're just talking about the good old days, you know?
[31:37.180 --> 31:38.400]  Oh, he's going down the middle.
[31:38.560 --> 31:39.240]  He's going down the right.
[31:39.460 --> 31:40.420]  Oh, now he's going down the right.
[31:41.320 --> 31:43.540]  Oh, he bounced you back.
[31:43.740 --> 31:44.060]  What?
[31:44.320 --> 31:45.340]  Are you going to roll back?
[31:45.940 --> 31:46.500]  Oh, it's going to...
[31:46.500 --> 31:47.240]  He's going to get stuck.
[31:47.500 --> 31:48.240]  He's going to get...
[31:48.240 --> 31:49.880]  We're going to be stuck in the goddamn loop.
[31:52.520 --> 31:54.480]  He's on like stroke six at this point.
[31:55.560 --> 31:55.780]  Close.
[31:56.920 --> 31:58.500]  Oh, he made it.
[32:00.800 --> 32:01.740]  Geoff and Da Bird.
[32:03.260 --> 32:03.560]  Wow.
[32:03.980 --> 32:05.440]  Would have been nice if I made it all the way down.
[32:11.550 --> 32:12.090]  Jesus.
[32:12.910 --> 32:13.450]  Oh.
[32:13.730 --> 32:14.500]  Oh, good.
[32:15.390 --> 32:16.710]  Oh, yeah, that's good.
[32:16.850 --> 32:17.390]  Oh, right.
[32:17.570 --> 32:18.270]  Oh, no.
[32:18.870 --> 32:19.150]  Oh, no.
[32:19.510 --> 32:19.790]  Oh, no.
[32:20.490 --> 32:21.030]  Boat.
[32:21.170 --> 32:21.370]  Boat.
[32:22.150 --> 32:22.510]  Boat.
[32:23.650 --> 32:25.290]  What the fuck?
[32:26.050 --> 32:27.130]  Oh, no.
[32:27.870 --> 32:29.210]  You got killed by a shark.
[32:29.690 --> 32:32.590]  That was a really long time for that to happen.
[32:32.690 --> 32:33.650]  That was very interesting.
[32:34.130 --> 32:35.430]  What a kick in the dick.
[32:36.690 --> 32:37.590]  Where are you going?
[32:38.350 --> 32:38.890]  Stop.
[32:45.050 --> 32:45.470]  Stop.
[32:45.470 --> 32:47.310]  This game is simply being polite to you.
[32:47.430 --> 32:49.190]  It's a slow developing play.
[32:51.590 --> 32:52.010]  Oh.
[32:52.990 --> 32:54.010]  What was that?
[33:03.520 --> 33:04.160]  Oh, God.
[33:04.220 --> 33:05.120]  That was just a little too soft.
[33:05.300 --> 33:05.540]  Fuck.
[33:06.340 --> 33:07.060]  I really...
[33:07.060 --> 33:09.420]  I was like really afraid of hitting it too hard.
[33:09.900 --> 33:10.700]  That worked?
[33:10.820 --> 33:11.540]  Yeah, straight down.
[33:13.020 --> 33:15.220]  Yeah, but you think a lot of people just stole those dildos?
[33:16.140 --> 33:16.580]  Yeah.
[33:18.640 --> 33:19.080]  Weird.
[33:19.460 --> 33:20.560]  Somebody stole your dildos, Gav?
[33:21.900 --> 33:24.340]  No, I just said we lost quite a lot of dildos at AH.
[33:25.040 --> 33:25.580]  Oh, yeah.
[33:25.720 --> 33:26.980]  God knows what happened to them all.
[33:29.460 --> 33:30.120]  There you go.
[33:30.840 --> 33:34.320]  We all just assumed you took them because of your thing with dildos, but...
[33:34.320 --> 33:35.220]  I didn't even think about it.
[33:35.560 --> 33:36.140]  Oh, fuck.
[33:38.880 --> 33:39.620]  Oh, no.
[33:40.560 --> 33:41.840]  Not the bad one.
[33:42.340 --> 33:43.100]  Is it bad?
[33:43.620 --> 33:44.620]  No, that's an alright one.
[33:44.620 --> 33:45.220]  It's the shark.
[33:45.980 --> 33:46.700]  Surely not.
[33:47.380 --> 33:50.100]  Oh, you got a spring.
[33:50.160 --> 33:51.320]  Jump, jump, jump.
[33:51.320 --> 33:51.920]  Jump in the jump.
[33:51.960 --> 33:52.740]  Shoot us all in the air.
[33:53.720 --> 33:54.380]  Out of bounds.
[33:55.540 --> 33:57.860]  You almost made it to that little trough down there, though.
[33:58.420 --> 33:59.860]  May have given you some bad advice.
[33:59.920 --> 34:00.760]  I'd like to apologize.
[34:01.360 --> 34:02.380]  No, I'm good with the reset.
[34:03.040 --> 34:03.660]  I didn't like that.
[34:06.780 --> 34:07.860]  I'm gonna beat this shark.
[34:08.280 --> 34:08.580]  Oh, God.
[34:08.600 --> 34:09.720]  What did my woman just do?
[34:10.040 --> 34:10.600]  What was that about?
[34:10.680 --> 34:11.560]  Yeah, that happened to me earlier.
[34:12.000 --> 34:13.000]  Wait, you might go.
[34:13.120 --> 34:13.540]  You might go.
[34:13.540 --> 34:15.000]  I'd go dicks.
[34:17.800 --> 34:18.780]  Yeah, like a dildo.
[34:19.200 --> 34:19.500]  It's in the hole.
[34:20.340 --> 34:21.300]  It's in the hole.
[34:25.440 --> 34:31.820]  I think the day I interviewed, I was touring through broadcast and there was a dildo suction cup to a window in there.
[34:34.360 --> 34:36.740]  Patrick was like, huh, that sounds right.
[34:37.060 --> 34:37.820]  What's that doing there?
[34:42.890 --> 34:43.690]  Oh, look at that.
[34:43.730 --> 34:44.710]  Oh, he's in.
[34:45.010 --> 34:45.370]  Uh oh.
[34:45.570 --> 34:46.150]  A lot of beans.
[34:46.570 --> 34:48.030]  You gonna go in the shark mouth?
[34:48.030 --> 34:50.570]  No, this is gonna get in the boat this time.
[34:51.310 --> 34:52.310]  We're boating.
[34:52.830 --> 34:54.430]  Yeah, I think you are boating.
[34:54.490 --> 34:55.410]  Trench me up!
[34:57.150 --> 34:57.750]  Yeah!
[34:58.910 --> 34:59.270]  Wow.
[34:59.630 --> 35:00.150]  Boat cam!
[35:04.190 --> 35:04.790]  Macaw.
[35:05.690 --> 35:06.670]  Oh, right, I'm sorry.
[35:06.750 --> 35:07.210]  Macaw.
[35:12.710 --> 35:13.910]  So now...
[35:13.910 --> 35:14.450]  Then what?
[35:15.210 --> 35:15.550]  Okay.
[35:16.190 --> 35:17.070]  Just for no reason.
[35:17.070 --> 35:17.430]  Alright.
[35:22.730 --> 35:24.530]  Most complicated bogey I've ever seen.
[35:26.090 --> 35:27.050]  What am I doing?
[35:28.610 --> 35:29.590]  Yeah, it's not good.
[35:29.950 --> 35:30.390]  You'll be fine.
[35:30.890 --> 35:31.530]  You got it.
[35:31.650 --> 35:32.450]  I wouldn't hit it too hard.
[35:34.450 --> 35:35.670]  I don't know what the fuck you're gonna do.
[35:35.970 --> 35:36.070]  What?
[35:36.210 --> 35:36.710]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:37.930 --> 35:38.290]  Okay.
[35:38.650 --> 35:39.010]  Okay.
[35:40.450 --> 35:41.750]  And how do you feel about that?
[35:42.610 --> 35:43.010]  You know.
[35:43.790 --> 35:44.350]  Well, you know.
[35:47.070 --> 35:48.370]  We don't, that's why we asked.
[35:49.930 --> 35:50.670]  Beanage there.
[35:52.690 --> 35:56.450]  Here we go.
[35:57.990 --> 36:00.610]  How am I gonna win from this?
[36:02.450 --> 36:03.730]  You're right there.
[36:04.850 --> 36:06.990]  Just gotta save a good 14 hits.
[36:08.590 --> 36:09.210]  Okay.
[36:09.330 --> 36:10.470]  I don't trust that I'm first.
[36:12.410 --> 36:13.830]  I don't trust this.
[36:14.490 --> 36:15.190]  Do you have electricity?
[36:15.930 --> 36:16.710]  I wish I did.
[36:16.710 --> 36:17.230]  I have a play.
[36:17.350 --> 36:18.650]  I'm gonna hit it in the crock mouth.
[36:19.230 --> 36:23.710]  Nick just wants you to, Nick wants everyone to have electricity and just not go anywhere.
[36:24.050 --> 36:24.750]  I just park it?
[36:25.090 --> 36:25.210]  Yeah.
[36:25.250 --> 36:25.870]  Oh, he's got it.
[36:26.230 --> 36:26.350]  Woo.
[36:26.730 --> 36:26.950]  Yeah.
[36:27.450 --> 36:28.570]  I'm the Thomas Edison of this game.
[36:29.130 --> 36:30.010]  Oh, he's done it.
[36:30.130 --> 36:30.830]  He's done it.
[36:31.110 --> 36:31.510]  Oh.
[36:32.130 --> 36:32.490]  Oh.
[36:36.750 --> 36:37.150]  Oh.
[36:37.150 --> 36:37.530]  Oh.
[36:37.850 --> 36:38.110]  Oh.
[36:38.730 --> 36:39.130]  Oh.
[36:39.130 --> 36:39.150]  Oh.
[36:39.150 --> 36:39.170]  Oh.
[36:39.170 --> 36:39.190]  Oh.
[36:42.290 --> 36:43.010]  Double electricity.
[36:43.810 --> 36:45.150]  What the fuck?
[36:45.890 --> 36:46.350]  What happened?
[36:50.450 --> 36:51.950]  That's a real kick in the pants for everyone.
[36:55.310 --> 36:56.250]  Oh, he's done it.
[36:56.410 --> 36:56.810]  All the way through.
[36:56.990 --> 36:57.230]  All the way through.
[36:57.390 --> 36:58.070]  God damn it.
[36:58.490 --> 36:58.730]  Shit.
[37:01.310 --> 37:02.490]  Oh, you're still there, Andrew.
[37:04.190 --> 37:04.630]  No, spider.
[37:04.630 --> 37:05.250]  Give me the spring.
[37:06.390 --> 37:06.950]  Oh, man.
[37:06.970 --> 37:07.950]  He was coming for you too.
[37:08.810 --> 37:09.170]  Oh, man.
[37:11.450 --> 37:12.790]  Gavin's trap is still activated.
[37:13.370 --> 37:14.410]  Oh, is it?
[37:14.690 --> 37:14.810]  Yeah.
[37:14.830 --> 37:15.090]  Shield.
[37:15.290 --> 37:15.490]  Oh, I missed it.
[37:15.830 --> 37:16.810]  No, no, you have the shield.
[37:16.870 --> 37:17.150]  You're fine.
[37:18.730 --> 37:19.510]  Damn it.
[37:24.210 --> 37:24.750]  What the fuck?
[37:25.290 --> 37:25.850]  What was that?
[37:28.610 --> 37:29.210]  Little butt.
[37:29.730 --> 37:30.830]  Is this game making you sick again?
[37:34.150 --> 37:34.550]  Now.
[37:35.010 --> 37:35.230]  Now.
[37:35.470 --> 37:35.850]  Too late.
[37:35.970 --> 37:36.070]  Now.
[37:36.630 --> 37:37.130]  You blew it.
[37:37.370 --> 37:37.570]  Now.
[37:37.830 --> 37:38.070]  Now.
[37:38.790 --> 37:39.470]  Oh, come on.
[37:39.670 --> 37:40.070]  Now.
[37:41.130 --> 37:41.430]  Now.
[37:41.570 --> 37:41.670]  Go.
[37:43.910 --> 37:44.690]  Oh, spring it.
[37:44.790 --> 37:45.350]  All right, spring it.
[37:45.390 --> 37:45.570]  Spring.
[37:45.990 --> 37:46.170]  Spring.
[37:47.410 --> 37:48.070]  Don't use it.
[37:48.830 --> 37:49.630]  I'm trusting Nick.
[37:51.990 --> 37:52.310]  Oh.
[37:56.610 --> 37:57.990]  All right, Gavin, you got this.
[37:58.070 --> 37:58.510]  There you go.
[37:58.530 --> 37:58.830]  There you go.
[37:59.090 --> 38:00.950]  I'm going to get it right over that softball.
[38:00.970 --> 38:01.290]  Suck me in.
[38:01.470 --> 38:01.810]  That's it.
[38:01.970 --> 38:02.470]  Way too hard.
[38:02.830 --> 38:03.810]  You fucking moron.
[38:04.410 --> 38:05.050]  Wait, wow.
[38:06.170 --> 38:09.150]  Well, it's got to go all the way out to the gob, hasn't it?
[38:09.450 --> 38:09.950]  Hadn't it?
[38:10.070 --> 38:10.510]  It didn't.
[38:10.510 --> 38:10.670]  What was that?
[38:11.630 --> 38:12.190]  No, baby.
[38:12.550 --> 38:13.230]  Oh, god damn.
[38:14.930 --> 38:15.810]  You know what to do.
[38:16.650 --> 38:17.730]  Oh, that's a spring.
[38:17.950 --> 38:18.090]  Damn.
[38:18.770 --> 38:19.230]  I sprung it.
[38:21.150 --> 38:23.010]  I sprung it right into Spidey.
[38:24.010 --> 38:24.910]  Why didn't Geoff jump?
[38:31.720 --> 38:32.580]  Now, spring.
[38:35.200 --> 38:35.680]  Spring.
[38:37.160 --> 38:37.640]  Spring.
[38:44.700 --> 38:45.520]  Do it, do it, do it.
[38:45.540 --> 38:46.200]  Hit him, hit him, hit him.
[38:46.340 --> 38:47.200]  Do it, do it, hit him, hit him.
[38:47.200 --> 38:47.940]  You know what you have to do.
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.000]  Hit him, hit him, hit him.
[38:49.000 --> 38:49.580]  You know what you have to do.
[38:49.580 --> 38:49.800]  Hit him.
[38:50.280 --> 38:51.500]  Andrew really wants to pick lunch.
[38:51.520 --> 38:52.420]  He wants to win.
[38:52.520 --> 38:53.820]  Andrew wants to win so bad.
[38:53.920 --> 38:55.100]  Oh, is the winner picking lunch today?
[38:55.380 --> 38:55.640]  Yeah.
[38:56.820 --> 38:57.080]  Nice.
[38:57.080 --> 38:58.180]  Didn't you guys all eat lunch?
[38:58.460 --> 38:58.860]  Didn't we break?
[38:59.040 --> 38:59.500]  Did you eat lunch?
[39:00.140 --> 39:00.200]  Yes, absolutely.
[39:00.200 --> 39:02.160]  Yeah, I had chimichangas, but yeah.
[39:02.460 --> 39:02.800]  I'll eat a sandwich.
[39:03.240 --> 39:04.300]  You had chimichangas?
[39:04.400 --> 39:04.860]  I did.
[39:04.960 --> 39:05.360]  Air fried.
[39:07.300 --> 39:07.440]  Oh.
[39:09.500 --> 39:09.760]  Shit.
[39:13.880 --> 39:14.700]  Oh, it's me.
[39:19.060 --> 39:20.020]  Nice and easy.
[39:20.540 --> 39:21.060]  Nice.
[39:21.060 --> 39:21.620]  Nice and easy.
[39:22.740 --> 39:23.260]  Nice.
[39:23.620 --> 39:24.140]  Nice.
[39:24.620 --> 39:25.700]  He cleared it.
[39:26.300 --> 39:26.780]  Oh.
[39:27.580 --> 39:28.880]  Close every time, man.
[39:28.900 --> 39:29.880]  It's close every time.
[39:30.300 --> 39:30.800]  Heartbreaker.
[39:30.920 --> 39:33.420]  And if you get it, it rises all ships or whatever.
[39:33.960 --> 39:34.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:35.780 --> 39:36.620]  There you go.
[39:36.660 --> 39:38.140]  If you get it, it rises all ships.
[39:38.940 --> 39:39.500]  Or whatever.
[39:39.520 --> 39:40.280]  As they say.
[39:40.600 --> 39:41.800]  You're a tide that's rising.
[39:49.320 --> 39:49.660]  Oh.
[39:49.660 --> 39:49.800]  Oh.
[39:57.970 --> 39:58.370]  Eric.
[40:01.510 --> 40:02.650]  I hate this hole.
[40:03.590 --> 40:04.530]  I want it to be over.
[40:11.650 --> 40:12.610]  Why would you?
[40:12.750 --> 40:13.890]  I was trying to jump in the hole.
[40:14.650 --> 40:16.030]  You would have gotten it in the hole.
[40:20.300 --> 40:20.920]  Stunt boy.
[40:21.300 --> 40:21.780]  Hole seven.
[40:27.140 --> 40:27.540]  Oh.
[40:27.560 --> 40:28.340]  It's me.
[40:28.440 --> 40:29.240]  Let's see what we got.
[40:29.360 --> 40:30.300]  A lot going on here.
[40:30.500 --> 40:30.600]  Oh.
[40:31.240 --> 40:32.040]  In the snake's gob.
[40:32.120 --> 40:32.400]  Here we go.
[40:32.480 --> 40:33.580]  Shoot into the snake.
[40:35.280 --> 40:35.680]  Eat me.
[40:35.880 --> 40:36.840]  Oh, shit.
[40:38.740 --> 40:39.540]  Eat me.
[40:40.000 --> 40:40.640]  Is that not it?
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.100]  Feels like a target against Geoff.
[40:44.060 --> 40:45.540]  Yeah, what am I supposed to do with this?
[40:47.260 --> 40:49.020]  Maybe it's a lighter tap with the jump.
[40:49.020 --> 40:50.180]  Oh, it opens its gob.
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.100]  That's tough.
[40:55.580 --> 40:56.240]  You can do it.
[40:59.640 --> 41:00.680]  Oh, no.
[41:02.220 --> 41:02.740]  Yes.
[41:03.060 --> 41:03.580]  What?
[41:04.340 --> 41:04.840]  Oh.
[41:05.840 --> 41:06.940]  It's in the hole.
[41:07.700 --> 41:08.060]  Wow.
[41:09.580 --> 41:10.380]  Me and snakes.
[41:10.560 --> 41:13.000]  We're on the same level, baby.
[41:13.620 --> 41:14.980]  I can't believe I'm about to do this.
[41:15.200 --> 41:15.800]  Holy shit.
[41:17.120 --> 41:18.160]  I love him, Jacques.
[41:18.300 --> 41:18.840]  I love him.
[41:20.800 --> 41:21.880]  Close your dumb mouth.
[41:24.300 --> 41:24.820]  Open.
[41:25.740 --> 41:26.500]  He said that's Vela.
[41:26.500 --> 41:28.580]  Oh, he went for it.
[41:28.580 --> 41:28.900]  Oh, wow.
[41:29.040 --> 41:29.700]  Geoff got it, too.
[41:29.980 --> 41:30.860]  Geoff got snakes.
[41:31.040 --> 41:31.480]  Wow, wow, wow.
[41:31.700 --> 41:32.520]  I'm going to light my candle.
[41:33.380 --> 41:33.780]  Forgiving.
[41:35.580 --> 41:36.640]  That's very forgiving.
[41:36.660 --> 41:37.000]  You know what?
[41:37.020 --> 41:37.900]  I forgive you, Andrew.
[41:44.800 --> 41:45.200]  Fuck.
[41:46.380 --> 41:46.780]  What?
[41:47.620 --> 41:48.420]  The fuck?
[41:49.080 --> 41:49.760]  What is that?
[41:50.260 --> 41:50.760]  Blast him.
[41:50.940 --> 41:51.420]  Annihilate him.
[41:51.480 --> 41:51.780]  No.
[41:52.260 --> 41:52.840]  Fuck him up.
[41:53.000 --> 41:53.820]  Send him to hell.
[41:54.160 --> 41:54.660]  Do it.
[41:57.940 --> 41:58.960]  Make him doom guy.
[41:59.220 --> 41:59.620]  I'm mashing B.
[41:59.620 --> 42:00.920]  It won't let me dodge.
[42:04.720 --> 42:05.780]  Where did I go?
[42:05.780 --> 42:06.740]  And now you get a freehold.
[42:08.500 --> 42:10.200]  Now you're stuck in Anaconda Alley.
[42:10.520 --> 42:11.000]  Where are you?
[42:11.240 --> 42:11.840]  Did I jump from that?
[42:12.000 --> 42:12.560]  Did I jump?
[42:15.900 --> 42:16.860]  Hell yeah.
[42:17.340 --> 42:18.080]  Nice, Gavin.
[42:20.200 --> 42:20.680]  What?
[42:23.480 --> 42:23.960]  Gavin.
[42:24.540 --> 42:25.020]  No.
[42:25.800 --> 42:27.340]  He fucking blew it.
[42:29.340 --> 42:29.700]  No.
[42:29.700 --> 42:31.260]  You really Andrewed that one.
[42:31.340 --> 42:32.200]  And you got a bomb.
[42:34.760 --> 42:35.800]  You're in a bad way.
[42:37.940 --> 42:38.620]  Oh, what's this?
[42:38.620 --> 42:39.000]  Free ball?
[42:39.480 --> 42:40.360]  Yeah, free ball.
[42:40.640 --> 42:40.960]  Do that.
[42:41.800 --> 42:42.240]  Free hit.
[42:42.300 --> 42:42.780]  Get me out of here.
[42:47.010 --> 42:47.670]  Oh, you know.
[42:48.110 --> 42:48.410]  Yeah.
[42:48.550 --> 42:49.090]  Not a bad idea.
[42:49.370 --> 42:50.230]  Yeah, it could have gone worse.
[42:50.850 --> 42:51.330]  Take me there.
[42:51.710 --> 42:52.090]  Put me down.
[42:53.470 --> 42:54.170]  Oh, yeah.
[42:54.370 --> 42:54.950]  Oh, yeah.
[42:55.030 --> 42:55.430]  Go, spider.
[42:55.610 --> 42:55.970]  Go.
[42:57.050 --> 43:00.310]  Man, I feel like the DLC bugs are a lot kinder than the main game.
[43:00.570 --> 43:03.670]  Yeah, didn't they used to toss the shit out of you?
[43:03.770 --> 43:06.290]  Toss the absolute shit out of you.
[43:10.290 --> 43:11.370]  Time for you to stand.
[43:13.010 --> 43:14.530]  Yeah, mine just did the same thing.
[43:15.330 --> 43:15.650]  Prick.
[43:16.570 --> 43:17.570]  Prick-ass watch.
[43:19.610 --> 43:20.950]  I'll stand when I'm good enough.
[43:22.550 --> 43:24.250]  Well, you get another shot at the snake.
[43:24.250 --> 43:26.110]  Oh, you get another snake time.
[43:27.410 --> 43:28.430]  You don't have a joke.
[43:28.750 --> 43:31.270]  I don't want to jump the gun, but I don't think you're going to win today.
[43:31.690 --> 43:32.010]  Okay.
[43:33.470 --> 43:34.190]  Eat in his mouth.
[43:34.670 --> 43:34.870]  Yeah.
[43:35.790 --> 43:36.550]  You did it, Gavin.
[43:38.510 --> 43:39.210]  Spring free.
[43:40.430 --> 43:42.350]  Spring free or die hard.
[43:44.030 --> 43:44.930]  With a vengeance.
[43:46.750 --> 43:47.170]  Uh-oh.
[43:47.910 --> 43:48.610]  Uh-oh.
[43:48.850 --> 43:49.250]  Oh.
[43:49.470 --> 43:49.790]  What did it say?
[43:49.830 --> 43:51.130]  Be sure to check your surroundings?
[43:52.070 --> 43:52.950]  Yeah, just in case.
[43:52.950 --> 43:53.890]  What if something's there?
[43:55.750 --> 43:57.530]  What if that snake got out?
[43:58.130 --> 44:00.850]  Whoa, that moon is so detailed.
[44:03.030 --> 44:03.530]  Detail.
[44:05.330 --> 44:06.770]  Is that the crab mask?
[44:07.170 --> 44:07.330]  Yeah.
[44:09.030 --> 44:09.530]  What?
[44:09.730 --> 44:11.030]  Oh, one stick.
[44:12.730 --> 44:13.230]  Wow.
[44:14.010 --> 44:16.950]  Did you bounce off the stick or did you hit a button?
[44:17.430 --> 44:19.350]  No, no, I bounced off the stick.
[44:19.490 --> 44:20.330]  Oh, man.
[44:21.650 --> 44:22.870]  Man, you really threaded that needle.
[44:22.870 --> 44:24.090]  That's brutal.
[44:27.960 --> 44:29.760]  I mean, it was a really good shot.
[44:33.810 --> 44:34.430]  Uh-oh.
[44:37.130 --> 44:38.410]  Oh, very good.
[44:38.630 --> 44:38.730]  Wow.
[44:40.150 --> 44:40.850]  Get him, crab.
[44:41.930 --> 44:42.750]  Get him, crab.
[44:42.810 --> 44:45.550]  Oh, you broke his mask.
[44:46.270 --> 44:47.610]  He doesn't know who he is anymore.
[44:47.870 --> 44:48.270]  Oh, man.
[44:48.270 --> 44:48.950]  That can be hurt.
[44:49.430 --> 44:50.630]  Are those holes on the side?
[44:51.350 --> 44:51.830]  Probably.
[44:52.930 --> 44:53.310]  What?
[44:58.590 --> 44:59.010]  Nice.
[44:59.490 --> 45:00.070]  He's got the spring.
[45:00.250 --> 45:01.430]  Feeling good about that.
[45:02.330 --> 45:03.510]  There you go.
[45:04.290 --> 45:04.670]  Shit!
[45:05.050 --> 45:05.150]  Out of bounds.
[45:07.130 --> 45:08.870]  So I want to get in the hut.
[45:09.330 --> 45:10.110]  Yeah, looks like it.
[45:10.830 --> 45:11.250]  Alright.
[45:12.770 --> 45:13.530]  Oh, there's a crab.
[45:13.830 --> 45:14.030]  I don't know.
[45:16.790 --> 45:17.670]  Crab's no good.
[45:17.690 --> 45:18.570]  He's hiding his identity.
[45:19.150 --> 45:20.690]  Was that crab there the whole time?
[45:20.890 --> 45:21.230]  Yes.
[45:22.050 --> 45:22.330]  Okay.
[45:24.860 --> 45:25.280]  Okay.
[45:25.320 --> 45:25.720]  Out of bounds.
[45:28.780 --> 45:29.300]  Shit.
[45:30.640 --> 45:30.820]  Mm-hmm.
[45:31.840 --> 45:32.860]  Mysterious village.
[45:40.780 --> 45:41.300]  Boosh!
[45:41.680 --> 45:42.120]  Nice.
[45:43.760 --> 45:45.440]  Put some stank on that one.
[45:45.460 --> 45:46.580]  Oh, stanky!
[45:46.820 --> 45:47.020]  Oh.
[45:49.180 --> 45:51.060]  Is there a stanky Kong?
[45:52.140 --> 45:53.440]  There should be a stanky guy.
[45:55.560 --> 45:57.080]  Where the fuck am I going?
[45:57.560 --> 45:58.200]  Oh, God.
[45:59.220 --> 46:00.020]  Get crab.
[46:01.200 --> 46:02.320]  I guess I'll go this way.
[46:06.100 --> 46:07.160]  Excuse me, Mr. Crab.
[46:08.100 --> 46:09.760]  I seem fucking serious right now.
[46:14.880 --> 46:16.480]  A crab only has eight legs.
[46:17.960 --> 46:19.060]  How many should it have?
[46:21.480 --> 46:21.880]  Ten.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  Fucked up the call-out.
[46:25.320 --> 46:25.800]  It's a disability.
[46:26.600 --> 46:27.520]  Yeah, don't make fun of him.
[46:27.960 --> 46:29.380]  I just think it's not a crab.
[46:30.280 --> 46:30.800]  What do you think it is?
[46:30.800 --> 46:31.520]  Jesus Christ.
[46:32.840 --> 46:34.200]  I knocked him.
[46:34.840 --> 46:36.240]  I'm sensitive over here.
[46:36.440 --> 46:39.960]  So, if I lost one of my legs in an accident, would I not be a man to you?
[46:40.280 --> 46:41.160]  No, but you wouldn't be a crab.
[46:42.480 --> 46:43.940]  But I was never a crab.
[46:44.260 --> 46:45.280]  Oh, he's done it.
[46:45.640 --> 46:46.640]  Oh, he did it!
[46:47.080 --> 46:47.660]  In the hole!
[46:48.700 --> 46:49.060]  Wow.
[46:49.280 --> 46:50.740]  He put spears all over the map.
[46:50.920 --> 46:51.500]  I think he fucked us up.
[46:51.800 --> 46:52.840]  I think that was it.
[46:53.480 --> 46:53.940]  That was awesome.
[46:55.780 --> 46:56.480]  That rules.
[46:56.740 --> 46:57.340]  I'll just do that.
[46:57.400 --> 46:57.720]  Okay.
[46:57.940 --> 46:58.600]  I'm gonna do that then.
[46:58.780 --> 46:59.440]  Yeah, just do that.
[46:59.620 --> 47:00.520]  Yeah, just do it.
[47:00.520 --> 47:01.420]  Ah, shit.
[47:01.440 --> 47:01.960]  That's fucking good.
[47:02.140 --> 47:03.000]  That's fucking good.
[47:03.420 --> 47:04.340]  That might do it.
[47:04.840 --> 47:05.520]  That might do it.
[47:05.920 --> 47:06.560]  If you can bounce it.
[47:06.560 --> 47:07.080]  You might have it.
[47:08.340 --> 47:09.120]  He got it too early.
[47:09.120 --> 47:09.720]  Oh, off the drum!
[47:10.360 --> 47:10.480]  Oh!
[47:10.740 --> 47:11.980]  No, he missed it!
[47:12.520 --> 47:12.780]  You missed.
[47:12.780 --> 47:13.100]  What?
[47:13.960 --> 47:16.100]  You jumped just a hair too early.
[47:16.700 --> 47:18.560]  I got the vacuum without the jump, idiot.
[47:18.800 --> 47:19.760]  Yeah, well done!
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.020]  They said it couldn't be done, and you proved them wrong.
[47:23.140 --> 47:24.680]  I wonder if it's still active down there.
[47:24.900 --> 47:25.440]  It'd be awesome.
[47:26.500 --> 47:27.680]  I'd like to take advantage of that.
[47:28.240 --> 47:29.400]  No, it looks like it's closed.
[47:29.400 --> 47:30.740]  Oh, yeah, you're right.
[47:33.460 --> 47:35.220]  Vacuum for me, not for thee.
[47:36.240 --> 47:36.900]  That's right.
[47:39.120 --> 47:40.220]  Play the angles, Geoff.
[47:40.240 --> 47:40.720]  You got it.
[47:43.360 --> 47:44.740]  That total pull just looks like...
[47:44.740 --> 47:46.620]  Do you guys see that moon behind me?
[47:47.420 --> 47:48.700]  Look at that moon!
[47:49.400 --> 47:50.140]  I think you missed.
[47:50.700 --> 47:51.400]  I did miss.
[47:52.260 --> 47:53.460]  Little soft, bud.
[47:53.820 --> 47:54.580]  Little soft.
[47:54.740 --> 47:55.960]  That's what they call you, little soft.
[47:56.540 --> 47:57.700]  Little soft buds.
[47:57.700 --> 47:59.920]  Little soft down there.
[48:01.600 --> 48:03.800]  Yeah, you'll want to go towards the hole.
[48:05.020 --> 48:06.180]  Play the angles, Gavin.
[48:06.240 --> 48:06.880]  You got it.
[48:07.380 --> 48:07.840]  Here's an angle.
[48:08.300 --> 48:08.640]  Yep.
[48:09.660 --> 48:10.180]  Nice.
[48:10.620 --> 48:11.440]  Good angle.
[48:11.920 --> 48:12.860]  Good angle.
[48:16.380 --> 48:17.860]  It was an angle.
[48:18.620 --> 48:20.020]  Do I just squirt it?
[48:21.760 --> 48:23.000]  There we go.
[48:23.700 --> 48:25.080]  Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[48:25.080 --> 48:26.260]  Oh, oh, oh.
[48:26.940 --> 48:27.940]  You got it.
[48:29.360 --> 48:30.680]  Do you know what to do?
[48:31.560 --> 48:32.040]  Nope.
[48:32.720 --> 48:33.380]  I do not.
[48:34.440 --> 48:35.560]  I clearly do not.
[48:39.900 --> 48:40.880]  Clearly no clue.
[48:43.660 --> 48:45.020]  I can't hit him.
[48:46.080 --> 48:46.780]  Play the angles, Gavin.
[48:47.020 --> 48:47.460]  What's the pink?
[48:47.460 --> 48:47.960]  Play the angles.
[48:48.200 --> 48:48.440]  It's a shield.
[48:51.360 --> 48:52.600]  That's Stinky calling.
[48:55.080 --> 48:55.940]  Stinky calling.
[49:00.580 --> 49:01.700]  Thank you.
[49:01.880 --> 49:03.200]  Good thing you had a shield.
[49:03.880 --> 49:04.140]  Stop.
[49:04.280 --> 49:04.380]  Well.
[49:05.480 --> 49:05.960]  Stop.
[49:07.460 --> 49:08.180]  Hey, what's up?
[49:09.500 --> 49:10.620]  Not much.
[49:11.100 --> 49:11.520]  What's up with you?
[49:13.400 --> 49:14.120]  It's in the hole.
[49:15.080 --> 49:15.580]  A boggy.
[49:16.260 --> 49:16.680]  Great pot.
[49:17.100 --> 49:18.220]  You said great pot.
[49:18.900 --> 49:19.800]  Great pot.
[49:19.920 --> 49:20.360]  A boggy.
[49:20.720 --> 49:21.160]  Great pot.
[49:21.280 --> 49:21.500]  Wow.
[49:22.900 --> 49:24.580]  I'll not be making it on this round.
[49:24.580 --> 49:24.620]  Hit him.
[49:26.520 --> 49:27.080]  Hit him.
[49:27.300 --> 49:27.480]  Hit him.
[49:27.680 --> 49:27.880]  Hit him.
[49:27.980 --> 49:28.480]  He can't.
[49:28.620 --> 49:29.040]  He's shielded.
[49:29.180 --> 49:29.820]  He's shielded.
[49:29.900 --> 49:30.980]  Oh, fuck me hard, dude.
[49:31.060 --> 49:31.900]  Hit him.
[49:33.620 --> 49:34.020]  Oh.
[49:35.400 --> 49:35.800]  Oh.
[49:36.300 --> 49:37.040]  What an angle.
[49:38.340 --> 49:40.540]  You got to play the angles, boys.
[49:41.060 --> 49:41.900]  I've said it once.
[49:41.980 --> 49:43.380]  I've said it a thousand times.
[49:44.760 --> 49:45.920]  Playing the angles.
[49:46.740 --> 49:47.440]  Gavin, go right up the gut.
[49:47.520 --> 49:48.060]  You can't miss.
[49:50.720 --> 49:51.800]  Gavin, you didn't play the angle.
[49:53.860 --> 49:54.260]  Oh.
[49:56.340 --> 49:57.220]  Oh, cock.
[49:58.860 --> 50:00.320]  Not quite the angle there.
[50:00.980 --> 50:01.480]  There you go.
[50:02.820 --> 50:04.520]  Hey, you did it, buddy.
[50:06.140 --> 50:06.580]  Suck.
[50:06.860 --> 50:07.300]  All right.
[50:07.420 --> 50:09.980]  All right, I'm going to get a dodo and I'm going to win this damn thing.
[50:10.820 --> 50:11.620]  I'm going to get...
[50:12.380 --> 50:15.120]  So you need to make up 25 strokes to win.
[50:15.560 --> 50:15.820]  Yeah.
[50:17.440 --> 50:17.880]  Easy.
[50:18.720 --> 50:19.160]  Huh.
[50:19.900 --> 50:20.820]  Oh, what the fuck?
[50:21.640 --> 50:22.780]  Oh, is there an egg patch?
[50:23.420 --> 50:24.540]  Oh, my God.
[50:24.540 --> 50:26.520]  What is this?
[50:26.700 --> 50:27.760]  I don't want to go first.
[50:28.200 --> 50:28.640]  It's jump time.
[50:28.640 --> 50:29.080]  Too bad.
[50:29.360 --> 50:30.560]  Yeah, just chip it in.
[50:31.500 --> 50:33.300]  I'm going to look at the fucker first.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.300]  Andrew's bird is watching you.
[50:35.360 --> 50:35.720]  Look at him.
[50:36.120 --> 50:37.520]  Oh, my God, guys.
[50:38.680 --> 50:39.840]  This is not good.
[50:40.240 --> 50:40.840]  You got it.
[50:43.180 --> 50:44.860]  The eggs are the answer.
[50:46.920 --> 50:47.840]  Oh, wow.
[50:48.940 --> 50:49.460]  Oh.
[50:51.680 --> 50:53.400]  That's like a little tube hole.
[50:53.400 --> 50:55.500]  Yeah, I think I'm going to miss it.
[50:56.640 --> 50:59.400]  I wonder if I should just make a play for that.
[51:01.500 --> 51:02.060]  Hmm.
[51:02.340 --> 51:02.780]  Andrew?
[51:03.060 --> 51:04.040]  He's thinking on it.
[51:05.640 --> 51:06.200]  Hmm.
[51:07.600 --> 51:07.900]  Oh.
[51:11.450 --> 51:12.290]  He's thinking.
[51:12.990 --> 51:14.270]  Yes, indeed, he's thinking.
[51:19.690 --> 51:20.650]  Here it comes.
[51:22.990 --> 51:23.550]  Fuck.
[51:24.090 --> 51:25.150]  Not what I wanted.
[51:25.570 --> 51:27.490]  Oh, he made a decent...
[51:27.930 --> 51:29.150]  Not bad, though.
[51:29.250 --> 51:31.410]  Not a bad shot, but not what I wanted.
[51:33.690 --> 51:35.230]  All right, Gavin, you got this.
[51:35.850 --> 51:36.570]  Can I go in the hole?
[51:37.270 --> 51:38.110]  Yeah, absolutely.
[51:38.530 --> 51:38.970]  Yeah, sure.
[51:39.410 --> 51:40.490]  Go on, tin cup, you got it.
[51:41.350 --> 51:42.530]  Where did Andrew hit it?
[51:42.670 --> 51:43.730]  That's pretty good what you did.
[51:45.330 --> 51:46.410]  Do more beans.
[51:49.450 --> 51:50.510]  Probably just all of them.
[51:50.850 --> 51:51.610]  There you go.
[51:52.770 --> 51:53.910]  Oh, it's the eggs.
[51:55.270 --> 51:56.730]  Oh, you're trying for the eggs?
[51:56.730 --> 51:58.690]  Yeah, I think you got to go in the eggs.
[52:03.690 --> 52:04.930]  A little too hard.
[52:05.390 --> 52:06.990]  A little too hard.
[52:10.830 --> 52:13.250]  Were you going to get that with the right hardness?
[52:13.950 --> 52:14.250]  No.
[52:15.210 --> 52:16.330]  I was trying to bounce.
[52:17.090 --> 52:18.390]  I wasn't going for the eggs.
[52:18.910 --> 52:20.070]  I'm always the right hardness.
[52:22.910 --> 52:23.350]  It's true.
[52:23.490 --> 52:24.270]  Many have said it.
[52:27.990 --> 52:28.390]  Huh.
[52:30.610 --> 52:31.610]  All right, Andrew, it's your turn to play the angles.
[52:32.490 --> 52:33.550]  Oh, I'm playing these angles.
[52:34.170 --> 52:34.950]  You got an egg patch?
[52:35.110 --> 52:39.970]  Six times four divided by nine plus five equals hole in one.
[52:40.490 --> 52:41.990]  Is that what you think angles are?
[52:43.870 --> 52:45.190]  Well, he's doing the angle math.
[52:45.570 --> 52:47.170]  Oh, get him, get him, get him.
[52:47.430 --> 52:48.770]  Oh, boy.
[52:49.010 --> 52:51.270]  Am I going to get killed when I go to putt?
[52:51.670 --> 52:52.070]  Yeah.
[52:52.170 --> 52:52.870]  Doesn't look good.
[52:55.970 --> 52:56.410]  Hmm.
[52:57.930 --> 52:59.010]  I didn't seem right.
[52:59.430 --> 53:00.750]  It looks like you would have tried to aim that.
[53:01.330 --> 53:02.550]  Just a bit outside.
[53:03.390 --> 53:03.910]  A little soft.
[53:04.810 --> 53:05.750]  A little soft.
[53:06.310 --> 53:07.370]  I'm fine in the middle, boys.
[53:08.650 --> 53:10.610]  I didn't know my rat name would come into this.
[53:12.350 --> 53:16.610]  Uh, OK.
[53:17.050 --> 53:18.170]  Yeah, Geoff is timing it.
[53:19.630 --> 53:21.910]  Well, he's got to divide six times four.
[53:22.230 --> 53:22.650]  Yeah.
[53:23.230 --> 53:24.610]  Got to do all Andrew's math.
[53:24.690 --> 53:25.430]  Oh, shit.
[53:26.830 --> 53:27.970]  Oh, it's looking all right.
[53:28.290 --> 53:29.010]  Oh, wow.
[53:29.630 --> 53:30.610]  That saved you.
[53:30.790 --> 53:31.530]  Holy shit.
[53:31.670 --> 53:32.710]  Yeah, but look at the angles.
[53:32.850 --> 53:33.570]  But look at the angle.
[53:34.470 --> 53:35.470]  Yeah, I mean, it's all right.
[53:35.990 --> 53:36.770]  Oh, you got this, Andrew.
[53:38.070 --> 53:39.550]  I just don't want to get fucking killed.
[53:39.910 --> 53:41.590]  You're going to fucking die, dude.
[53:42.070 --> 53:43.790]  You're going to take an arrow in the asshole.
[53:46.210 --> 53:46.830]  You know what to do.
[53:47.410 --> 53:49.130]  You know what to do.
[53:49.130 --> 53:50.270]  I truly don't.
[53:50.290 --> 53:53.950]  If you catch an arrow in the asshole, isn't that a yearly bonus or something?
[53:54.010 --> 53:54.690]  Yeah, something like that.
[53:54.850 --> 53:55.470]  Nah, it's a fish.
[53:55.930 --> 53:56.250]  Swordfish.
[53:56.450 --> 53:57.010]  Oh, that's right.
[53:57.090 --> 53:57.930]  That's swordfish, yeah.
[54:00.070 --> 54:00.390]  What?
[54:04.800 --> 54:05.120]  What?
[54:06.400 --> 54:07.260]  What do you mean, what?
[54:07.340 --> 54:08.520]  It hit one of those things.
[54:08.940 --> 54:09.780]  It hit a spear.
[54:10.020 --> 54:10.640]  That's some bullshit.
[54:16.970 --> 54:17.510]  All right.
[54:17.530 --> 54:19.570]  Come back around, you can get the...
[54:19.570 --> 54:19.870]  Ooh.
[54:21.130 --> 54:22.810]  Can I even go on the lip there?
[54:24.170 --> 54:26.430]  I'm going to try for it, but I don't know, man.
[54:26.730 --> 54:27.450]  Why would it be there?
[54:28.470 --> 54:28.670]  How?
[54:29.670 --> 54:30.710]  What are you doing every time?
[54:30.810 --> 54:31.210]  Terrible.
[54:31.350 --> 54:31.750]  What's going on?
[54:32.550 --> 54:33.910]  What are you doing every time?
[54:37.130 --> 54:38.690]  Maybe you should just lightly tap.
[54:39.150 --> 54:40.350]  Fucking Christ, man.
[54:40.610 --> 54:41.690]  I'm just trying to like...
[54:42.970 --> 54:43.730]  Yeah, there you go.
[54:44.770 --> 54:45.650]  That's it right there.
[54:47.010 --> 54:47.690]  Hell yeah.
[54:47.850 --> 54:49.430]  It hit an invisible wall of some kind.
[54:49.790 --> 54:50.070]  Sweet.
[54:50.470 --> 54:51.510]  And you're still...
[54:51.510 --> 54:52.230]  You know what to do.
[54:52.730 --> 54:53.650]  And Andrew, you got it.
[54:53.690 --> 54:54.210]  You know what to do.
[54:54.250 --> 54:55.230]  You know what to do.
[55:03.690 --> 55:04.430]  Get him, Crab.
[55:04.650 --> 55:05.090]  Oh, it's boss.
[55:05.150 --> 55:05.510]  Send him over.
[55:05.770 --> 55:06.130]  Send him over.
[55:06.250 --> 55:06.650]  He broke it.
[55:06.750 --> 55:07.170]  Send him to hell.
[55:09.050 --> 55:09.610]  Crab bros.
[55:09.710 --> 55:10.050]  I don't mind.
[55:10.210 --> 55:12.210]  I couldn't do that if I wanted to.
[55:12.210 --> 55:12.850]  No, I don't think so.
[55:13.630 --> 55:14.210]  I bet you could.
[55:14.810 --> 55:15.690]  I bet you could.
[55:15.690 --> 55:19.370]  I bet if you went up this hill just enough on the...
[55:19.370 --> 55:19.790]  You see it?
[55:20.910 --> 55:22.910]  And just dropped into it.
[55:23.070 --> 55:23.830]  Oh, like on this?
[55:24.530 --> 55:25.930]  Yeah, but what would that do?
[55:26.650 --> 55:27.650]  It'd get electricity.
[55:28.990 --> 55:31.350]  And then he could shoot Geoff and Andrew up.
[55:32.950 --> 55:34.030]  I'm not sure about that.
[55:35.370 --> 55:36.710]  Sounds like a bad plan.
[55:36.830 --> 55:38.150]  See, now don't you wish you had it?
[55:38.190 --> 55:39.270]  Oh, that was close.
[55:41.830 --> 55:42.270]  Cock.
[55:50.040 --> 55:50.400]  Cock.
[55:50.400 --> 55:50.940]  Here it comes, boys.
[55:52.740 --> 55:53.880]  Oh, you got close.
[55:55.500 --> 55:56.260]  Play the angles.
[55:56.660 --> 55:57.540]  Play the angles, Geoff.
[55:57.620 --> 55:58.200]  You got it.
[56:00.840 --> 56:02.480]  There is an invisible thing there.
[56:02.700 --> 56:04.140]  There's an invisible thing there, right?
[56:04.900 --> 56:06.040]  Andrew, you know what to do.
[56:06.600 --> 56:07.180]  Come on, Andrew.
[56:07.220 --> 56:07.780]  You know what to do.
[56:08.300 --> 56:08.600]  Andrew.
[56:09.520 --> 56:11.620]  If I knock him off, he'll just respawn, right?
[56:12.060 --> 56:12.720]  No, he won't.
[56:13.100 --> 56:13.900]  Go back to the beginning.
[56:14.220 --> 56:14.960]  Go back to the beginning.
[56:16.380 --> 56:17.460]  I don't know why you would do that.
[56:17.460 --> 56:18.580]  I'm already losing, but...
[56:20.660 --> 56:22.460]  Yeah, but this will slow Andrew down, Geoff.
[56:22.680 --> 56:24.300]  Which is good for Gavin and Eric.
[56:24.400 --> 56:24.900]  Yeah, right.
[56:25.060 --> 56:26.340]  We're really going to catch up.
[56:26.420 --> 56:26.740]  No!
[56:26.800 --> 56:28.980]  You didn't kill him, and you're going back to the beginning.
[56:29.380 --> 56:29.780]  Oh!
[56:30.060 --> 56:30.680]  Oh, nice!
[56:32.480 --> 56:33.900]  You almost did it.
[56:36.480 --> 56:37.660]  Changes my whole approach.
[56:38.720 --> 56:38.960]  Yeah.
[56:39.080 --> 56:40.020]  I gotta find these eggs.
[56:41.940 --> 56:42.780]  Where's Eric at?
[56:43.040 --> 56:44.300]  Is this a ramp or is that a wall?
[56:44.780 --> 56:45.280]  It's a ramp.
[56:45.820 --> 56:46.720]  It's a ramp wall.
[56:48.600 --> 56:49.560]  You can jump that.
[56:50.140 --> 56:50.780]  Yeah, you can try.
[56:51.060 --> 56:51.740]  Egg patch!
[56:56.540 --> 56:58.320]  It's like you got sniped out of the air.
[56:59.780 --> 57:00.980]  Did I get hit by something?
[57:01.420 --> 57:01.940]  It looked like it.
[57:04.940 --> 57:05.300]  Oh!
[57:05.720 --> 57:05.860]  What?
[57:06.820 --> 57:07.320]  Oh, shit!
[57:11.020 --> 57:13.280]  Oh, this is going to be great when Andrew comes back up.
[57:15.900 --> 57:16.600]  You got it!
[57:17.460 --> 57:18.560]  You got it!
[57:19.820 --> 57:21.120]  Now you know what to do.
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.420]  You know what to do.
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.360]  Geoff, you know what to do.
[57:27.200 --> 57:30.740]  Geoff, you should probably go a little more towards the end.
[57:31.940 --> 57:32.740]  Andrew, you know what to do.
[57:32.740 --> 57:33.420]  I really hate myself.
[57:33.600 --> 57:34.280]  I really hate myself.
[57:35.340 --> 57:36.580]  You gotta get those eggs, dude.
[57:36.920 --> 57:37.600]  He's got eggs.
[57:38.880 --> 57:39.900]  Oh, you're not at the beginning.
[57:42.140 --> 57:43.620]  Oh, eggs are right there.
[57:43.820 --> 57:45.820]  Oh, he's primed for the egg patch.
[57:46.180 --> 57:46.920]  Okay, okay.
[57:46.920 --> 57:48.400]  Yeah, the eggs are right there.
[57:48.600 --> 57:50.640]  Oh, yeah, you can do it off this wall for sure.
[57:52.060 --> 57:54.340]  The eggs are like right around there.
[57:54.380 --> 57:54.740]  They're right there.
[57:54.900 --> 57:55.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:55.660 --> 57:56.740]  I'd say like a little bit more right.
[57:56.920 --> 57:58.800]  Like just like a hair more right, I think you would have it.
[57:59.080 --> 58:01.540]  Well, if I go up to the left, there'll be less of a lip.
[58:01.680 --> 58:02.240]  That's true.
[58:02.400 --> 58:02.920]  That is true.
[58:02.960 --> 58:03.760]  So this is the egg patch.
[58:04.260 --> 58:04.420]  Yeah.
[58:05.320 --> 58:05.680]  Eggs!
[58:07.880 --> 58:09.700]  That was going straight for the eggs.
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.480]  Still instantly out of bounds.
[58:12.600 --> 58:13.200]  You're in the air.
[58:13.600 --> 58:13.960]  Nice.
[58:14.460 --> 58:14.960]  Oh, God.
[58:16.280 --> 58:16.660]  Oh!
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.100]  Bomber.
[58:21.890 --> 58:22.070]  Alright, Geoff.
[58:22.410 --> 58:24.450]  I'm still...
[58:25.230 --> 58:25.910]  Just lightly.
[58:26.370 --> 58:26.590]  Yeah.
[58:26.790 --> 58:28.250]  No, there's no such thing as lightly, dude.
[58:28.350 --> 58:29.530]  Why are you going towards it?
[58:29.550 --> 58:30.390]  Just go left and right.
[58:30.430 --> 58:31.470]  Yeah, just go to the other...
[58:31.470 --> 58:32.750]  What is wrong with you?
[58:34.030 --> 58:35.650]  I was just thinking...
[58:35.650 --> 58:35.970]  No way!
[58:36.670 --> 58:37.410]  Okay, that worked.
[58:37.690 --> 58:38.590]  I can't believe that worked.
[58:38.590 --> 58:38.870]  He made it!
[58:38.990 --> 58:39.670]  That was great.
[58:40.750 --> 58:41.130]  Unreal.
[58:41.450 --> 58:42.150]  I don't know what I was doing.
[58:43.570 --> 58:44.750]  You just gotta...
[58:44.750 --> 58:45.850]  I can't deal with invisible.
[58:45.850 --> 58:46.450]  I'm sorry.
[58:47.930 --> 58:48.250]  Right.
[58:48.470 --> 58:51.650]  But I was gonna have you move more towards the center than towards the bridge.
[58:51.990 --> 58:54.110]  Oh, you are primed for egg.
[58:54.310 --> 58:54.510]  Yep.
[58:54.930 --> 58:56.030]  So egg-primed.
[58:57.370 --> 58:58.590]  You're primed for egg.
[58:58.710 --> 59:00.390]  That should be a service we start.
[59:00.530 --> 59:01.630]  Instead of Amazon Prime, it's just...
[59:01.630 --> 59:01.890]  You got it.
[59:02.010 --> 59:02.650]  This is it right here, Gavin.
[59:03.150 --> 59:03.370]  I think...
[59:03.370 --> 59:05.090]  We'll deliver eggs to your house in three hours.
[59:05.210 --> 59:07.730]  I think I could use your electricity to get me to the hole.
[59:07.830 --> 59:08.690]  You definitely could.
[59:09.130 --> 59:09.550]  Got it.
[59:10.250 --> 59:11.530]  There really should have been an Eggman.
[59:11.630 --> 59:12.590]  Like, there was a milkman.
[59:13.670 --> 59:15.270]  Well, there wasn't a...
[59:15.270 --> 59:15.630]  Eggman?
[59:16.450 --> 59:16.610]  Yeah.
[59:17.330 --> 59:17.990]  Sonic Hedgehog?
[59:18.130 --> 59:19.370]  He didn't deliver eggs, did he?
[59:19.570 --> 59:20.510]  Eric, you know what you have to do.
[59:20.790 --> 59:22.190]  Well, you don't know what he did in the off hours.
[59:22.610 --> 59:22.990]  That's true.
[59:26.750 --> 59:27.390]  I don't know.
[59:28.090 --> 59:29.190]  And I got up there!
[59:29.190 --> 59:29.870]  And it worked!
[59:30.250 --> 59:30.570]  Keep going.
[59:30.690 --> 59:30.950]  Stop.
[59:31.010 --> 59:31.210]  Keep going.
[59:31.690 --> 59:32.490]  Boom, baby.
[59:33.350 --> 59:35.130]  Did I go off?
[59:35.790 --> 59:36.770]  Oh, I guess we'll find out.
[59:38.450 --> 59:40.110]  Geoff, it is time for you to end it.
[59:40.810 --> 59:41.570]  You've done it.
[59:42.070 --> 59:42.190]  Nice!
[59:43.290 --> 59:44.010]  Yay, Geoff!
[59:44.170 --> 59:44.810]  How do you feel, Geoff?
[59:44.810 --> 59:45.550]  You've played all the holes.
[59:46.230 --> 59:46.590]  Yay!
[59:48.710 --> 59:50.550]  There it is.
[59:51.310 --> 59:52.990]  Oh, I think it's left her.
[59:52.990 --> 59:53.690]  I think it's left her.
[59:54.130 --> 59:54.890]  No, no, he's fine.
[59:54.890 --> 59:55.990]  Yeah, dude, he wasn't even close.
[59:56.070 --> 59:56.730]  It's more left.
[59:57.010 --> 59:57.370]  More left.
[59:57.510 --> 59:58.410]  Yeah, it seems to be more left.
[59:58.450 --> 59:59.770]  Just trying to get him to stroke up.
[01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:02.810]  Where is this?
[01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.930]  Whoa, that's unfortunate phrasing.
[01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:10.470]  There you go.
[01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.790]  Perfect.
[01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.350]  That was the thing that you did.
[01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:15.530]  You were in the village.
[01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.910]  You backtracked.
[01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:19.470]  You know what to do.
[01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.590]  Modern day all along.
[01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.770]  You know what to do.
[01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:22.370]  He's right there.
[01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.670]  Right on the lip.
[01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:24.680]  I hit the post.
[01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.010]  Thank God it was out of bounds.
[01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:30.190]  Left.
[01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:32.590]  I think that's too left.
[01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:33.390]  It was right, wasn't it?
[01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.250]  I think you have to hit it a little bit harder.
[01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:39.010]  Yeah, I think eggs like beans.
[01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:43.630]  Get me up there.
[01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.470]  Traditional full English.
[01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:46.870]  Oh, look at that.
[01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:47.890]  Wow.
[01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:49.270]  Get me down there.
[01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:50.330]  Oh, God.
[01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:51.870]  Oh, this is going to be...
[01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:52.250]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:53.010]  Here comes death.
[01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:54.430]  Dangerous.
[01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:54.930]  Oh, God.
[01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.790]  Dangerous.
[01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:58.670]  You've got to be lined up.
[01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.410]  You know what to do.
[01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:00.950]  He is lined up directly.
[01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:03.030]  You know what to do.
[01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:03.490]  No.
[01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:05.490]  But the eggs.
[01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:06.310]  Eric, you know what to do.
[01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.910]  Yes.
[01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.390]  I missed.
[01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:14.070]  This is your one shot, buddy.
[01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.910]  You're not left enough.
[01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:17.070]  No.
[01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:21.270]  Goodbye, Andrew.
[01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:23.250]  What if you just caught eggs from there?
[01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:24.450]  There he is.
[01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:24.930]  He's still left.
[01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.490]  Where are you going?
[01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:28.670]  Maybe you can knock him into the eggs.
[01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:30.410]  Send him to hell, Gavin.
[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:32.190]  Oh, no.
[01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.210]  Say goodnight to the eggs.
[01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.070]  Give me the eggs.
[01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:38.270]  We're eggsing together.
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.370]  He's still right there.
[01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.970]  Oh, he's back.
[01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.470]  No.
[01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:48.770]  Oh, no.
[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.050]  Crap.
[01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:49.670]  He's got the eggs.
[01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.450]  These are elusive eggs.
[01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:55.070]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:56.230]  We want them.
[01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:56.610]  The eggs.
[01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:58.110]  That's the next we could hit, man.
[01:01:58.690 --> 01:01:59.610]  Andrew's going eggless.
[01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.870]  Elusive egg targets.
[01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:06.250]  It looks like you and Andrew to me.
[01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:09.550]  Going eggless.
[01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:13.190]  847.
[01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:14.450]  I think it's left.
[01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:17.530]  It's left of this.
[01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:19.730]  It's definitely left.
[01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:19.970]  Yeah.
[01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:21.170]  Where the hell is Eric?
[01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:22.370]  Over there.
[01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.670]  Yeah.
[01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.130]  That's Andrew.
[01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:25.750]  Where is Eric?
[01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:27.170]  Did you just wake up?
[01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:29.470]  Oh, there you are.
[01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:30.850]  I fell asleep.
[01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:33.010]  I fell asleep today at 6am.
[01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:35.530]  What?
[01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:36.010]  You did?
[01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:36.650]  Yeah.
[01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:37.450]  Why?
[01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:38.290]  What were you doing?
[01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.110]  I was trying to sleep all night.
[01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:40.890]  Not doing it.
[01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.690]  And then my CPAP got all phlegmed up with phlegm.
[01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:44.770]  And then I went to sleep at 6.
[01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:47.690]  Well, you'd never have known it.
[01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.510]  Eggs.
[01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:50.430]  Eggs.
[01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:53.710]  Oh, man.
[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:56.750]  I don't know why that was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life, but it was.
[01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:57.310]  Eggs?
[01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:02.290]  No!
[01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:02.690]  Ew!
[01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:06.550]  You guys are having a rough time on this hole.
[01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.410]  There you go.
[01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.490]  There you maybe got it.
[01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:13.050]  No!
[01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:16.510]  It's a hard egg.
[01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:18.490]  Oh, dear me.
[01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:19.210]  Fuck him up.
[01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:20.210]  Where's Eric?
[01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:22.550]  He's back where he was.
[01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:23.930]  You keep missing him.
[01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:24.670]  Don't do it.
[01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.070]  It's that invisible shitting state spear thing.
[01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:29.410]  You guys keep talking about invisible stuff on this level.
[01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:31.030]  There's nothing invisible on this level.
[01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.670]  There's plenty of it.
[01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:32.370]  You wouldn't see it.
[01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:35.570]  You literally hit the pole last time.
[01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:37.030]  Who, this way?
[01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:41.110]  Who, who, this way?
[01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.130]  Eric, he didn't get to bed until 6.
[01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:47.550]  We woke him up at 6.30.
[01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:51.030]  Where am I now?
[01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:53.730]  Where did I go?
[01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.350]  Eric, show him that there's no invisible wall there and hit him.
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:57.770]  Okay.
[01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:00.650]  That was just a real wall.
[01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:02.510]  We're okay, we're okay, we're okay.
[01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:02.910]  We're in business.
[01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:03.870]  We're fine.
[01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.070]  You got eggs, Andrew?
[01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:08.350]  Oh, he's got eggs.
[01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:11.650]  Oh, he didn't get it.
[01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:14.110]  I think he's on the other side of that invisible wall, though.
[01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.950]  He's lined up.
[01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:15.710]  Whack him.
[01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:16.670]  He's right there.
[01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.030]  He's right there.
[01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:19.290]  Whack him up.
[01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:21.510]  Send him to oblivion.
[01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:22.030]  Too hard.
[01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:23.630]  Or you can close a gate.
[01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.310]  Oh my god.
[01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:25.250]  I think I put him over.
[01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:26.310]  I think you had...
[01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:27.210]  Where did I go?
[01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:28.070]  No, no, he's...
[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:29.810]  Oh, it took me back.
[01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.770]  You know what to do.
[01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.990]  You know what to do.
[01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.470]  He didn't do it.
[01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:39.850]  And he paid.
[01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:42.050]  What a day.
[01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.410]  Alright, this is it right here.
[01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:47.830]  Andrew's got it.
[01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.290]  Go.
[01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:51.310]  Keep going.
[01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:52.430]  That's nice.
[01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:53.050]  That's nice.
[01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:53.450]  Keep going.
[01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.250]  That's very nice.
[01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:57.510]  That's a real shame.
[01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:58.170]  Nice.
[01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.250]  Gotta catch him before the next turn.
[01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.130]  Just launch it.
[01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:05.830]  You'll hit the bridge.
[01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:06.530]  Life.
[01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:10.370]  Well, maybe if you went more left.
[01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:15.810]  But...
[01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:17.110]  No!
[01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.790]  I got sniped while sniping.
[01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:27.910]  Go for the X.
[01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:31.310]  Go for the X.
[01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:38.630]  How do you guys always end up taking the longest on the last hole?
[01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:44.590]  This is coming from the guy who wouldn't shut up about you know what to do.
[01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:45.990]  Hey, why are you guys taking so long?
[01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:47.490]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:49.250]  What are you talking about? You listen to me.
[01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:50.290]  That's true.
[01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:52.990]  Oh, that's the eggs.
[01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:54.350]  Oh, that's the eggs!
[01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:55.330]  Yes!
[01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:58.230]  That should've been eggs.
[01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:59.710]  That should've been eggs.
[01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:00.930]  Should've been the egg drop.
[01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:05.770]  Skip.
[01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:07.870]  Are we an egg podcast?
[01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:09.110]  Nah.
[01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:10.310]  We were for a while.
[01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:14.530]  You don't have the guts.
[01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:15.630]  Oh, yeah?
[01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:16.750]  How's this for guts?
[01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:20.310]  Oh, he did.
[01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:21.130]  I didn't go off.
[01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:22.170]  I can't believe that.
[01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:25.510]  I see someone who's about to.
[01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:29.990]  Send him the eggs.
[01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:32.170]  Send him the eggs.
[01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.350]  Oh, there he is.
[01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:40.070]  Send him back down.
[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.770]  Yeah.
[01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.590]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:52.310]  The game actually helped you.
[01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:53.070]  That's a better shot.
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:54.710]  I can't believe it!
[01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.030]  You're lined up pretty good.
[01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:59.850]  The fucking karma at playing through the spears.
[01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.850]  I was gonna absolutely oblivionate him.
[01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:04.410]  Oblivionate?
[01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:05.570]  Yeah.
[01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:06.330]  I like that.
[01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:07.590]  I can't believe it!
[01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:12.370]  You went so far back.
[01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:14.190]  I'm all the way over here!
[01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:16.230]  Oh, you're hiding behind a spear.
[01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:18.810]  Where did vengeance bring you?
[01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:21.150]  Oh, that's so bad.
[01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.710]  The spear is covering him.
[01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.310]  The best revenge you can get now is to just score.
[01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:31.530]  This game's had enough of us.
[01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:32.590]  Oh, dear.
[01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:33.270]  Oh, the eggs.
[01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:33.990]  Oh, the eggs!
[01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:35.870]  Oh, the eggs!
[01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:38.490]  Oh, you're primed for egg season.
[01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.310]  You're not even aiming.
[01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:42.090]  No.
[01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.850]  Oh, hit him.
[01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:44.530]  Just hit him.
[01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:45.190]  No!
[01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:46.290]  No!
[01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:51.310]  Oh, my fucking God.
[01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:52.610]  How did you do that?
[01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.070]  Gavin's back!
[01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:56.170]  You can go straight down the fucking path, dude!
[01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:56.650]  Gavin!
[01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:58.090]  He's not even there anymore!
[01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:00.490]  To the heart?
[01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:01.590]  He's right there.
[01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:02.530]  Where?
[01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:04.650]  He's behind the spear again.
[01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:05.390]  Is he?
[01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:08.510]  Gavin, you're just seeing what you want to see.
[01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.670]  Is he not there?
[01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:10.790]  I swear he's there.
[01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:11.930]  I'm behind the spear again.
[01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:17.310]  Free hole.
[01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:18.190]  You got the free...
[01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:18.590]  Oh, no!
[01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:19.610]  Oh, he didn't get it.
[01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:23.090]  Take two.
[01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.150]  The game just wants you to succeed.
[01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:27.510]  You're so well set up.
[01:08:27.610 --> 01:08:28.870]  You're even better set up.
[01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:29.910]  Yeah!
[01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:32.970]  No one had this great of a shot at the hole.
[01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:34.490]  Should have got that free shot there.
[01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:40.090]  Oh.
[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.750]  No!
[01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:47.590]  There has to be a stroke count.
[01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:48.350]  Unreal.
[01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:50.650]  I don't think there is.
[01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:52.090]  Gavin, I gotta be out in the open now.
[01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:54.690]  Yeah, I bet you can see him now.
[01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:58.210]  You wanted this to end?
[01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.490]  All the way over there.
[01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.050]  Where is he?
[01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:02.730]  I might be able to get you a free shot here.
[01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:03.390]  Yeah, you might.
[01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.810]  Oh shit, I've missed.
[01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:06.270]  I'll have to redo that.
[01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:09.650]  I think I missed.
[01:09:09.690 --> 01:09:10.630]  Okay, hold on.
[01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.710]  Did you?
[01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:12.290]  Okay.
[01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:14.810]  I missed.
[01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:17.350]  You were better off the first shot.
[01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:18.010]  He's gonna get the electricity.
[01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:19.410]  He's gonna get the electricity.
[01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:21.330]  He's gonna get the electricity.
[01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:26.370]  Now I'm primed for eggs.
[01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:32.210]  Geoff is over it.
[01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:34.950]  I just had so much other stuff to do.
[01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:37.130]  Yeah, I gotta edit the podcast.
[01:09:41.650 --> 01:09:43.390]  This is the furthest Eric's been.
[01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:44.850]  Please stop.
[01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.970]  Oh, maybe not.
[01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:47.050]  Oh, there you go, buddy.
[01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:47.950]  Well...
[01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:48.230]  There you go.
[01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:52.250]  You're about to find out about invisible walls.
[01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:53.970]  Shit.
[01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.770]  He didn't make it.
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:07.070]  That was it.
[01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:11.150]  Come back for me.
[01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.070]  No!
[01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:18.250]  The invisible wall!
[01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:19.890]  The invisible wall.
[01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.530]  He's got his own demons to fight.
[01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.810]  Oh, Christ.
[01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.650]  Oh, Jesus Lord.
[01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.930]  Oh, Lord ass.
[01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:42.470]  Oh, stupid crab.
[01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:47.850]  No, it was too soft.
[01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:49.150]  Why?
[01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:51.270]  I won't even help you.
[01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:53.490]  My finger slipped off the thing.
[01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:57.150]  Oh, that's it, Gavin.
[01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:57.390]  Yeah.
[01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.790]  Shortcut.
[01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:59.890]  I'm not gonna get you eggs, Gavin.
[01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:02.170]  You're gonna go straight up.
[01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:03.130]  Check this out.
[01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.550]  Electricity.
[01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:05.150]  Electricity.
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.330]  Hang on.
[01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:07.090]  Hang on.
[01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.470]  Son of the hell.
[01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:10.190]  Oh, shit.
[01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:13.190]  You wasted it.
[01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:13.950]  I'm gone.
[01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:16.010]  Wait, what?
[01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:18.310]  I've picked you off.
[01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:27.270]  The most deserved.
[01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:33.610]  No!
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.280]  No.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.100]  I'm gonna fall off.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:08.560]  No, you got it.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.440]  Please, please.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.140]  What a shot!
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:11.380]  Yes!
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:13.300]  Oh, Lord.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.360]  Geoff, Geoff, we're almost there.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.120]  Geoff, we're going home.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.340]  Gotta go for the Hail Mary.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.400]  Yeah, you gotta get him quick.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.520]  There you go.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.060]  Out of bounds.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.820]  Well, that's rough.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:31.070]  No!
[01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:31.690]  No!
[01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:33.590]  Oh, roll off.
[01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.550]  Roll off.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:01.560]  Alright, Gavin.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:02.240]  This is it.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.860]  Your last chance to knock that ball off.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.500]  I'm hiding behind the spear again.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:11.700]  Oh, yeah!
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.180]  So close.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:18.960]  Full beans.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.300]  There you go.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.760]  Just couldn't catch up to it.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:29.920]  Close.
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:35.300]  So the eggs are probably like...
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:42.480]  Oh, eggs!
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.100]  Oh!
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.820]  I just don't think it's possible.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.100]  I don't think it wants you to get it from there.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:48.840]  Yeah.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.520]  Because that should have been it.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.480]  It was, yeah.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.220]  It was a really good shot.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.000]  Speaking of really good shots.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:56.900]  There you go.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.240]  You got it right here.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.440]  Yeah, here you go.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.180]  Yeah.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:05.380]  Just launch it over.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:06.580]  This is the here you have it from.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.600]  What the fuck are you doing?
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.420]  He's trying to eggs again.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.900]  He wanted to go for the eggs, but he went too far the other way.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.020]  Eggs might not be doable.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.000]  How did that just occur to you, man?
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.960]  Wait, is there a crack?
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.940]  Is there a gap in front of the bridge?
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:25.580]  Yeah.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.080]  That's a Brit for you.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.140]  Always minding the gap.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:39.720]  Uh-huh.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:40.700]  Yeah.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.160]  See, now I might be primed for eggs.
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.780]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.520]  Invisible wall.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.460]  Is that not gettable?
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.180]  Yeah, that might be impossible.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.940]  What was your first clue?
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.980]  And maybe argue took him 35.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.180]  Oh, my God.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:08.320]  All right.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.420]  Now I might be primed for eggs.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.380]  Try it.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.240]  Check this shit out.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:13.600]  Whole beans.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.320]  Eggs!
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:17.320]  Oh!
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.760]  Just hit to the edge of the thing and then do it.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:22.860]  Instead of going in?
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:23.600]  Yeah.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.520]  Nick, shut up!
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:25.760]  What?
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:26.780]  We gotta know.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:28.040]  No, we don't.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.060]  We already know.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:29.900]  It doesn't work.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.700]  It doesn't work from that other angle.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.660]  Oh, my God.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.380]  Let's see the scoreboard.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.960]  Well, let's see the scoreboard.
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.620]  It was a fierce competition.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.940]  Andrew wins at a plus five.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.460]  I give a second a plus nine.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.580]  Team Gavin and Eric bring up the rear.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.320]  Eric's got a solid plus 23.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.060]  Gavin had a rougher day.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.160]  Plus 52 on the back nine.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.260]  Hey, that's the way it goes.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.780]  That's the way the back nine goes, baby.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.000]  That's mini golf, 3D Ultra, mini golf, whatever.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:15:59.880]  Incredible.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.100]  Andrew, how do you feel about your victory?
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.440]  I feel great.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.820]  I wish it didn't take 15.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.440]  I wish the eggs were doable, but I'm sure we'll do this again at some point.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.600]  What's for lunch?
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:10.880]  What's for lunch?
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.120]  Eggs.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:12.880]  Good question.
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:13.180]  Egg.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.200]  Oh, eggs.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:17.400]  Find your eggs.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.480]  Hold them tight.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.940]  Shoot them over a bridge.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.360]  Bye-bye.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.100]  Bye.
