[00:00.000 --> 00:07.400]  We're live! We're here! We're doing kickflips and stuff. And the greatest part of all,
[00:08.020 --> 00:15.560]  Gavin doesn't even realize it. I am party lead! I have sneak and control of this whole game! I'm
[00:15.560 --> 00:22.280]  never allowed to be leader! He didn't think about it, but I trapped them in my Tony Hawk lair!
[00:23.800 --> 00:26.980]  For a split second I thought you were gonna somehow blindside
[00:26.980 --> 00:29.280]  on a stream and I was like, how would that work?
[00:30.960 --> 00:37.780]  I thought the same thing. No stream blindsides, just some good old-fashioned Tony Hawk.
[00:38.680 --> 00:42.920]  Let's pick our skaters and then figure out what we're gonna do with this thing.
[00:44.080 --> 00:48.580]  Where do I do that? Just in the skater tab or? Well, I'm sure you already figured that out
[00:49.340 --> 00:54.730]  because you're in charge. You're talking to Andrew?
[00:55.670 --> 00:58.190]  Why would I have to figure out how you select your character?
[01:00.830 --> 01:04.890]  That doesn't feel like a me responsibility. I made the lobby. I'm in the mode. I'm looking.
[01:05.210 --> 01:07.530]  Right now I'm dealing with two twin Tony Hawks.
[01:15.330 --> 01:22.970]  I'm working on it. Oh, what happened to me? Oh, Gavin, you turned into like a nightmare. I don't
[01:22.970 --> 01:29.490]  even know how to describe you from my screen. I'm Nightmare Hawk. Nightmare? Nightmare Hawk.
[01:29.490 --> 01:32.730]  Did you put on like a filter on him or something like an alternate outfit?
[01:33.470 --> 01:45.270]  Yeah. Or is it just broken? No, that's my cool outfit. Okay. Well, Nick's picked. Yeah. Okay.
[01:45.390 --> 01:50.650]  So we have a few game modes we can pick between. Okay. We have Hawk. Oh, Guy W2.
[01:51.150 --> 01:54.830]  Thanks for the stuff. Oh, my God. Oh, my Morgz is the suck. We got a hype train going.
[01:55.530 --> 01:58.970]  Holy shit. Thank you so much, everybody. I haven't even looked over.
[01:59.750 --> 02:04.450]  Strive to subscribe to the Prime for two months on a two month streak. Thank you so much.
[02:04.690 --> 02:11.650]  Thank you. We got the rats. We got piss rats. We don't even need corn cats. Eric is in here.
[02:12.490 --> 02:19.050]  That's right. Just drop the piss rats. Jorky Biffus. Thank you so much for your continued support.
[02:20.850 --> 02:25.510]  Wow. Hype train level seven. Crazy. Did you guys pick your characters? Are you happy with them?
[02:25.510 --> 02:30.070]  Yeah. Sure. Okay. So these are our modes. Tell me which one you want to do.
[02:30.230 --> 02:34.190]  Hawk. Okay. Hide Hawk letters, then find your opponent's letters.
[02:34.790 --> 02:38.870]  Trick Attack. The player with the highest score at the end of the time wins.
[02:39.730 --> 02:42.430]  Score Challenge. First one to reach the set score wins.
[02:43.390 --> 02:47.810]  Combo Mambo. The player who busts the biggest combo during the time limit wins.
[02:48.610 --> 02:51.250]  Combo Challenge. First one to reach the combo score wins.
[02:51.250 --> 02:56.350]  Or Graffiti. Land tricks and combos off objects to tag them. Get the most tags to win.
[02:56.570 --> 02:59.730]  What are we feeling? I think we should hide the shit.
[03:00.450 --> 03:06.190]  Okay, let's start with the Hawk. We also can just free skate. Round length. We'll do medium.
[03:08.130 --> 03:11.750]  Do you guys... you were talking earlier while we were recording some other stuff. Both big
[03:11.750 --> 03:20.490]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 fans. You have a favorite level. Oh. We got Foundry, Canada, Rio, Suburbia,
[03:20.490 --> 03:27.150]  Airport, Skater Island, LA, or Tokyo. Airport's always fun. I like to airport. Okay, let's do
[03:27.150 --> 03:33.630]  airport. Because of the announcements. I wonder if they're doing any repairs at the airport. We'll
[03:33.630 --> 03:41.010]  have to see. Braxerman. Is that window fixed? Did they fix that window again? Thank you, Braxerman.
[03:41.710 --> 03:45.690]  Window? That door? The door. At the airport? At the airport. I didn't look.
[03:46.070 --> 03:53.470]  Look? Did you say look? That's all he said. So I guess he's telling you to go look and then report
[03:53.470 --> 04:00.430]  back to him. That's how I interpreted that. No, I didn't look. Oh. Oh. Oh, I see. Ollie. Ollie. Ollie.
[04:01.670 --> 04:09.470]  Okay, I remember how to do that. Is one of those placing letters? Yeah, who's doing the hiding?
[04:11.170 --> 04:15.770]  Oh, up next it says. Okay. So maybe it's just giving us some time to count down. Well,
[04:15.770 --> 04:18.770]  Gavin is green on my screen and you're blue, Nick. What color am I for you?
[04:19.890 --> 04:23.550]  Uh, hold on. He's green and I don't see you. Okay.
[04:25.530 --> 04:31.210]  Okay, Hawk had a good play. Hide phase. Seek phase. You get bonus points if any of your letters
[04:31.210 --> 04:36.090]  remain. Okay. Oh, I can drop letters. Okay. Can we all drop letters? Is that what we're all doing
[04:36.090 --> 04:40.550]  right now? Yeah, we're all doing it. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay, so we're all gonna get somewhere cool.
[04:40.550 --> 04:43.590]  Let me get away from the pack. Where do I go?
[04:48.590 --> 04:56.710]  Oh, that's just the spot. Maybe. Oh, damn it. Five balls.
[05:00.610 --> 05:02.330]  Let's see if they're gonna be great or awful.
[05:06.810 --> 05:12.930]  Good luck with that one. No stream peaking. I'm not. I know. Just a reminder.
[05:13.570 --> 05:20.570]  Yeah, I'm sorry, chat. Trying to remember. I need to just start fucking running out of time.
[05:21.330 --> 05:33.770]  Oh, shit. Oh, balls. Go, go, go. Okay. Okay, got it. That's terrible. Oh, no.
[05:34.270 --> 05:38.590]  Oh, there's one right there. Oh, no. I got it. Oh, shit.
[05:40.910 --> 05:44.250]  Wait, there's two right here. Where?
[05:47.030 --> 05:52.510]  Where? Right at the door. The front door. Are they mine? Oh, they are. Oh, is it the people who
[05:52.510 --> 05:58.470]  didn't finish theirs? I don't know. I found one, though. That might have been mine. That might have
[05:58.470 --> 06:04.630]  been a panic by me. Okay. Do you win if no one finds it? Oh, you're red, by the way.
[06:05.470 --> 06:09.330]  You're red, Andrew. I'm red. Okay. I'm blue. So, yeah, that was me.
[06:10.430 --> 06:15.330]  Why do I hate the camera so much? Was it always like this? Oh, yeah. It's inverted.
[06:16.010 --> 06:22.530]  Why would it be inverted left and right? It's default. To me, it's not. Left is left, right is right.
[06:22.830 --> 06:26.610]  That sounds like a joke. It is not a joke. Where did y'all put your fucking letters?
[06:27.670 --> 06:32.350]  Nick, did you invert my controls? Oh, you know what? Maybe I did.
[06:33.090 --> 06:40.850]  Do we get points for getting our own hawk? Oh, shit. You found my pile of letters.
[06:41.090 --> 06:48.010]  I found your pile. You had a pile of all four in a line? I just spelt all four on the spot.
[06:49.950 --> 06:54.970]  I'm going to spread mine out a bit better.
[06:56.910 --> 07:00.130]  I saw a K and then I turned a quarter and saw a hawk.
[07:03.770 --> 07:06.230]  God. Whoops. I put that down by accident.
[07:07.750 --> 07:12.530]  So, you're telling me that Andrew got a bunch of stuff right there? I did. I won the round because
[07:12.530 --> 07:19.470]  I found his hawk. It said all my letters were found with 0.1 or 0.2 seconds left or something.
[07:23.070 --> 07:33.010]  Ow, I tripped. Okay, at least mine. I'm happy. Oops. Hmm. I'm happy. I can just explore a little
[07:33.010 --> 07:46.850]  bit. Maybe do some scouting for next time. Oh, good idea. Interesting. Okay. Oh, I see a W.
[07:50.090 --> 07:55.390]  Can I pick up my own letters? I don't know. I was wondering that. Oh, I see a red one.
[07:56.450 --> 08:01.330]  Got it. Who's this one? I have one of each of yours.
[08:05.210 --> 08:12.310]  Oh, shit. Found a red one. I see another green. Yeah, give me that. How do I get that?
[08:13.190 --> 08:24.670]  Oh, you bastard. Yeah, where's, where's some other letters? Where would you? Oh, excellent.
[08:27.030 --> 08:35.990]  Damn you, Nick. What do you mean? Well, I was going to get that one. Oh, sorry, but not really.
[08:36.410 --> 08:45.330]  Shit. Oh, Santa 1583. Thanks for the old subs. Someone's not been found.
[08:48.890 --> 08:51.810]  Oh, oh, it's tight. It's tight.
[08:54.350 --> 09:03.870]  All right, let's see how we do. Oh, can I go through the? No. Huh. Hmm.
[09:08.360 --> 09:11.280]  Oh, I'm fucking up. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[09:13.860 --> 09:18.860]  Ow. Oh, I should hide something. I haven't done anything yet. Oh, you get your letter back if you
[09:18.860 --> 09:26.500]  fail. That's annoying. Oh, you do? Yeah. Yeah. If you want to place it somewhere tricky, you got to land it.
[09:33.070 --> 09:42.970]  Oops. What happened to me there? Where could I place this one? Oh, that's going to be terrible.
[09:45.490 --> 09:47.350]  Oh, shit. I, uh, I fucked up.
[09:49.410 --> 09:51.930]  Oh, that's the worst. Get up!
[09:55.650 --> 10:02.050]  Huh? Why did it? All right, see green. Yeah, I spawned on it!
[10:04.710 --> 10:11.090]  What else we got? Got an H. That's two aghs. Damn it.
[10:17.740 --> 10:18.980]  I think over here.
[10:21.860 --> 10:25.320]  Hold on. Andrew went back this way. Oh, that's a pretty heft. Ow. Ow.
[10:25.620 --> 10:28.740]  It's just a W on the middle of the floor. No, there's not.
[10:30.760 --> 10:32.340]  Definitely didn't run out of time and panic.
[10:34.720 --> 10:41.550]  Oh, I saw the W. I need to go. How do I get to it? Oh, I need to do that. Okay. Ow, son of a...
[10:44.120 --> 10:50.340]  Oh, I remember all these flags. Get up! Oh, there's the green. How do I get up there? Oh, no!
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.260]  Get up, fool! Turn the... Uh-oh. My own inverted has come back to haunt me. Gavin!
[10:58.020 --> 11:04.680]  Let me do it. Let me jump. No! Okay, I just... No one found all your letters. Well, Andrew won that.
[11:07.140 --> 11:09.320]  No, I do. Hell yeah! Not great.
[11:12.440 --> 11:13.160]  TURTLE POWER!
[11:16.180 --> 11:21.340]  Longest grind. Well, this is fun. I forgot how much I love this game. Yeah, these games are great.
[11:24.200 --> 11:31.060]  Okay, it's kicking us into a free skate. I wonder how... Let's see if I can swap mode. InverX is insane.
[11:32.600 --> 11:35.460]  Shall we try trick pack? You want to just go through all the modes? Yeah, I don't think I like that.
[11:35.460 --> 11:36.300]  Yeah, man.
[11:37.220 --> 11:39.840]  Uh, anyone have a preferred level for the next one?
[11:40.640 --> 11:40.940]  Yeah!
[11:41.500 --> 11:43.560]  Surprise us. We're going to Canada.
[11:44.360 --> 11:45.560]  Heading home to me.
[11:47.140 --> 11:51.600]  Do you think your house is in... Stop by and visit. In this level? Oh, a ninja turtle! That's me!
[11:52.200 --> 11:53.740]  Oh, that didn't work.
[11:55.020 --> 11:57.380]  How do you do, um... What's it called?
[11:58.340 --> 11:58.740]  Trick.
[12:01.120 --> 12:03.080]  Uh, jump and push X in any direction.
[12:03.800 --> 12:09.100]  Or kickflips up and down on the stick to go into a manual. Click Y to grind. Ow!
[12:09.900 --> 12:13.560]  And then just hit all your buttons once you're doing one of those things. Yeah.
[12:15.120 --> 12:21.710]  Ooh, ninja turtle. Play with the high score at the end of the time when it wins. Okay.
[12:22.550 --> 12:29.150]  I really don't like that. So what are we doing? Just, uh... Let's try to get as many points as... Oh, turtle down! Turtle down!
[12:31.470 --> 12:34.770]  Gavin's taking the lead! We're off to the races. Oh, I fell!
[12:39.140 --> 12:41.120]  Gah! Oh, I fell again.
[12:42.420 --> 12:43.700]  Oh, we should be dead!
[12:44.940 --> 12:46.560]  Andrew with 40,000.
[12:47.080 --> 12:55.550]  Oh, I landed out of bounds. Huh, didn't pull that off.
[12:57.270 --> 12:57.570]  Ah.
[13:06.310 --> 13:09.650]  Son of a bitch. No! You fool!
[13:11.610 --> 13:16.790]  Andrew, have you been practicing this? No, I've not been playing because I knew we were going to stream.
[13:18.530 --> 13:19.510]  Uh, same.
[13:20.650 --> 13:22.250]  Yeah, uh, I haven't played it at all.
[13:23.110 --> 13:26.910]  I haven't played since 2002 or whenever this was out. Yeah, what?
[13:29.650 --> 13:31.030]  Oh, you fool. You fool!
[13:32.030 --> 13:33.130]  It called me a hoser.
[13:34.670 --> 13:38.930]  Andrew, translate. Maybe trick attack is not the mode for all of us for this.
[13:42.070 --> 13:43.330]  Oh my god!
[13:47.410 --> 13:48.990]  He has 37,000.
[13:50.130 --> 13:54.790]  Oh, wait. No, I have 37,000. He has 400, 500,000. I'd like to apologize to Andrew.
[13:54.950 --> 13:59.530]  Yeah, listen, you guys will get it. Damn it. You just got to chain your tricks together. It's all about just doing combos.
[14:00.470 --> 14:04.130]  Go into like a manual and just start mashing buttons, then go to grind.
[14:04.790 --> 14:07.630]  Click the right or left trigger to spin. Oh, I turned down.
[14:09.250 --> 14:10.530]  Thank god everybody's watching me.
[14:13.430 --> 14:15.030]  You're an idiot, Nick. What are you doing?
[14:24.890 --> 14:25.370]  You're an idiot.
[14:25.370 --> 14:26.450]  Just having fun grinding. Yeah.
[14:27.730 --> 14:29.030]  Okay, well, that's a close one.
[14:30.890 --> 14:33.750]  At the bottom pier. Yeah, swap to a different mode.
[14:38.260 --> 14:40.580]  Why don't we... Is there a mode with a gun?
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.180]  There's no gun modes. Oh. I would like to see
[14:45.860 --> 14:50.120]  a score challenge between you two. I'm just gonna like spectate you both.
[14:50.580 --> 14:52.940]  First one to get a million between the two of you.
[14:54.760 --> 15:01.880]  A million? A million. Ending at 501. Yeah, I just got 500,000 points. It's not high.
[15:02.840 --> 15:06.380]  I got 25,000. Did you see what we got? Yeah, you'll figure it out.
[15:06.880 --> 15:10.820]  I can give instructions. I can help. Turtle power. Yeah, can I mail you my controller?
[15:12.160 --> 15:15.260]  I can't do that. I might get here before you hit a million.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.560]  Do that launch. Let's see. Let's see what happens.
[15:24.480 --> 15:28.440]  Here we go. Score challenge. First one to hit the score.
[15:30.340 --> 15:31.360]  All right, here we go.
[15:32.980 --> 15:35.760]  Oh, you both grind. I didn't make sure you're like hitting the buttons. Oh, I didn't know I could do that.
[15:36.520 --> 15:39.880]  Oh, Gavin got me.
[15:43.780 --> 15:46.380]  I ain't tricking. I'm just gonna watch you. I keep forgetting he does that.
[15:47.040 --> 15:50.980]  Gavin starts with the big lead. Oh, but Nick has a combo going. Times three.
[15:51.640 --> 15:53.680]  That's what you got to do. You got to string those tricks together.
[15:54.500 --> 15:55.640]  When you're grinding and stuff,
[15:56.220 --> 15:58.940]  the easiest way to start combos is to grind and like manual.
[16:00.800 --> 16:03.880]  Fudge. What's manual? Up and down on the stick.
[16:04.800 --> 16:06.960]  Up and down on the stick? Yeah.
[16:08.580 --> 16:12.520]  Oh, I see. And then start hitting X, Y, or B while doing that. You'll start chaining.
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.500]  X, Y, or B. Okay. And you can do the same while grinding.
[16:21.400 --> 16:26.600]  Manual. Oh, I fell. Yeah, but you got to times four. You're getting there. You're building combos.
[16:28.160 --> 16:28.960]  Where am I getting?
[16:29.680 --> 16:34.260]  You're getting up the leaderboard. Forty three thousand. You're almost a tenth of the way there.
[16:34.980 --> 16:37.080]  I still don't understand the manual thing. Hold on.
[16:37.780 --> 16:39.260]  I'll watch your screen for a second.
[16:40.520 --> 16:44.220]  You just up and down on the stick and then it should initiate like a balance thing.
[16:45.120 --> 16:47.700]  Oh, when I'm in the air? No, when you're on the ground.
[16:48.960 --> 16:49.720]  That's when you're skating.
[16:51.540 --> 16:55.880]  What? I did a 180. On the right stick, left stick, up and down.
[16:56.620 --> 17:01.480]  All right. Nothing's happening when I do up and down. Oh, I see. Oh, I see.
[17:02.600 --> 17:03.400]  Now I get it.
[17:09.670 --> 17:12.510]  I comboed a manual, a manual, and a nose manual.
[17:13.950 --> 17:16.110]  That's what it's about. Yeah, that's it.
[17:17.090 --> 17:21.030]  Now we're getting it. Now you're getting it. Uh-oh, river.
[17:22.590 --> 17:23.270]  No, I don't think so.
[17:27.590 --> 17:29.690]  Ah, I suck. Just try to follow Gavin.
[17:32.190 --> 17:33.290]  God damn it.
[17:35.130 --> 17:37.310]  You guys got this, I believe in you.
[17:39.650 --> 17:43.330]  I have not played this game in such a long time. I got 200 points. Yeah.
[17:44.590 --> 17:46.710]  Hell yeah, Gavin with the times three.
[17:49.290 --> 17:50.630]  Oh, why did it end?
[17:51.570 --> 17:51.850]  Here.
[17:52.930 --> 17:55.110]  Ow. Gavin, when you get a second here, just look at me.
[17:56.370 --> 17:57.450]  So see all you want to do.
[17:58.130 --> 18:01.130]  Up and down on the stick, and then just start hitting your face buttons.
[18:01.710 --> 18:03.830]  And you start doing different things, and that creates combos.
[18:14.640 --> 18:21.220]  I just got, look at, I just, I didn't even move. I just started showing you. Oh, I was just breathing. There you go. I got 91.
[18:21.220 --> 18:28.220]  And then you just start hitting the X, Y, B, and you start doing more tricks, and that creates a larger combo multiplier.
[18:31.340 --> 18:33.240]  Yeah, my brain is not getting it right now.
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.120]  Y'all got this.
[18:39.040 --> 18:41.980]  And then do the same exact philosophy when grinding.
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.220]  And I think, uh, I'll leave it there. I think that's as far as we'll go for lessons for now.
[18:47.460 --> 18:48.860]  So you get the hang of it a little bit more.
[18:51.720 --> 18:52.600]  Can I just do this?
[18:52.940 --> 18:56.620]  I did some sort of hand plant up there.
[18:57.200 --> 19:00.580]  Yeah, if you click Y, you can do that, and then you start hitting the other buttons while balance.
[19:02.240 --> 19:08.640]  It went up, and I saw him initiate, and I couldn't see him, and then I saw him slide down the ramp like two seconds later.
[19:09.680 --> 19:10.900]  His face first.
[19:16.420 --> 19:21.740]  Are you recording this, Andrew? We're gonna put your footage up. No, I'm not. I couldn't start, I guess, but...
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.040]  I think it's gonna be amazing. You guys are gonna get this. You're almost at 100,000, Gavin.
[19:26.880 --> 19:33.600]  Make your one combo away from taking the lead in this nail-biting ex-game skateboarding performance.
[19:34.520 --> 19:34.920]  God.
[19:35.740 --> 19:40.600]  Oh, here he goes. Gavin, on the grind. Okay, face first. Oh, no.
[19:45.440 --> 19:45.840]  Okay.
[19:48.900 --> 19:52.620]  Maybe the move is just to stay in a place and do a kickflip. One kickflip at a time.
[19:52.620 --> 19:53.800]  A kickflip your way to a million.
[19:55.620 --> 19:58.420]  100 points. It might take a little bit, but you can do it.
[19:59.960 --> 20:02.740]  I don't know what I'm doing, apparently. I just don't remember.
[20:05.940 --> 20:13.520]  Oh, grab it, you dumb...
[20:13.520 --> 20:17.660]  This is so good. I'm so happy we did this.
[20:18.900 --> 20:22.600]  It's gonna be a whole stream of you guys trying to hit a million points.
[20:22.620 --> 20:24.140]  Never get there.
[20:24.820 --> 20:28.880]  Oh, Gavin. Oh, he's just... he's failing, though. He's falling. He's getting it, though.
[20:29.380 --> 20:36.760]  He's... I'm seeing the timeses. Times two, times four, times five, six, seven. The boys...
[20:37.540 --> 20:38.000]  crashing.
[20:40.720 --> 20:44.620]  Oh, that does not count. Excellent. But I'm starting to get it, maybe.
[20:55.230 --> 20:57.890]  I lost Gavin through the woods. What's going on, Nick?
[20:58.830 --> 21:04.390]  Oh, you're skating. Nope. Okay, hit a wall, but that's okay. Oh, you're manualing. Are you manualing?
[21:05.950 --> 21:10.170]  Click X and Y, Nick. Like, hit the face buttons while you're doing it. While it's happening?
[21:10.230 --> 21:14.450]  Yeah, while it's happening, hit the face buttons. That's how you start getting multiplayer. Oh, I see. Okay, now I'm getting that.
[21:14.570 --> 21:15.310]  I saw the times two.
[21:19.120 --> 21:20.560]  Oh my god.
[21:24.180 --> 21:29.340]  Thank you so much, Hallucination, for the sub...
[21:30.500 --> 21:37.380]  prediction on whether they make it by 5.01. That'd be a fantastic poll. Get your bets in, potentially.
[21:41.140 --> 21:44.340]  Thank you so much, Lapeet, for two months.
[21:45.620 --> 21:50.980]  Gavin holding his lead, but Nick climbing slightly. Gavin has taken the lead from me.
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.860]  Blazing in first. Oh my god.
[21:55.920 --> 22:02.440]  Oh, I hit my head real hard. That's real skateboarding. I really slammed it.
[22:09.520 --> 22:11.940]  Just hearing Nick sigh is so good.
[22:15.880 --> 22:21.480]  Thank you so much, Refurbished Twiglet, for the subs. What was that name?
[22:23.660 --> 22:24.540]  Refurbished Twiglet.
[22:25.480 --> 22:32.520]  That's a phenomenal name. It's a great name. Ah, you've bloody loved Twiglet. You missed it. Regulation Moon Girl, thank you so much for the subs.
[22:37.980 --> 22:43.800]  What's great about this experience so far is I feel like you two are doing almost as good as you would do in real life.
[22:43.800 --> 22:49.420]  Like the leap in skill is not as big, I think, for most people.
[22:51.320 --> 22:51.920]  What?
[22:54.780 --> 22:58.640]  No. Okay.
[23:00.140 --> 23:05.220]  It's a times three. I get excited whenever I see anything above a three. Oh, Nick with the five!
[23:05.680 --> 23:06.260]  Six!
[23:06.740 --> 23:13.440]  Seven! Eight! Yes! Points! Oh shit, Gavin. All right, we're learning, maybe.
[23:13.940 --> 23:16.020]  Nope. Nick's on his way to a Milski.
[23:16.840 --> 23:18.960]  Nope. Still behind you.
[23:19.680 --> 23:24.180]  Getting there, though. The gap is thousands instead of tens of thousands.
[23:30.640 --> 23:34.600]  IamRedApple says, Nick, read the chat. Press the trick buttons when grinding or manualing.
[23:38.260 --> 23:40.860]  Press the trick buttons when grinding. That's what I've been saying.
[23:42.320 --> 23:43.940]  You got this. Read the chat.
[23:46.860 --> 23:47.780]  All right, let's see.
[23:50.580 --> 23:51.380]  All right.
[23:59.600 --> 24:05.280]  I'm trying to measure who's more upset, you two at yourselves or the audience at you.
[24:08.200 --> 24:09.720]  This isn't a stream.
[24:14.620 --> 24:16.680]  Are people... you like this?
[24:17.120 --> 24:21.760]  I love this game. It's a great game. Not you. You both love Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3.
[24:21.760 --> 24:24.400]  You were talking earlier today about how great it was.
[24:25.500 --> 24:30.640]  Do you have any idea how many brain cells have been lost since I was playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3?
[24:32.900 --> 24:36.500]  Oh my god, I just cannot remember. It's like...
[24:38.440 --> 24:40.560]  Do I... I might need to go to the hospital.
[24:41.400 --> 24:46.380]  Do we want to just go back to Hawk mode where it's not as trick centric?
[24:47.320 --> 24:49.000]  No, it's fine. Okay.
[24:52.220 --> 24:57.620]  Turn around. Turn out the other way, you stupid useless...
[24:57.620 --> 24:59.300]  Oh, I passed Andrew. Excellent.
[24:59.620 --> 25:06.340]  You haven't landed a nice combo recently. Oh, a lot of spins by Nick. I suck so much shit.
[25:06.840 --> 25:08.640]  I suck so much shit.
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.920]  Thank you so much, Otterly Chaotic, for the subs. Ten subs is so kind of you.
[25:20.760 --> 25:26.100]  B Gibbles fan. Someone loves Blaine. Thank you so much for the subs. Is it Blaine?
[25:26.760 --> 25:27.680]  It might be.
[25:28.180 --> 25:28.920]  That'd be funny.
[25:29.920 --> 25:31.460]  That was a joke. I love Blaine.
[25:33.260 --> 25:35.300]  Oh, Deja Vu. Someone do something weird.
[25:37.480 --> 25:37.920]  Uh...
[25:38.560 --> 25:39.000]  Pineapple!
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.040]  Yeah, there you go. Not weird enough.
[25:42.060 --> 25:47.060]  Squid, melon, pineapple juice on my feet. Oh, I just lost 54,000 points.
[25:48.380 --> 25:49.240]  I'm gonna bank them.
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.140]  That's a third of what you have, essentially. I'm a silly bastard.
[25:54.800 --> 26:03.640]  Oh, Stockholm Child Kicker. Look at that. Look at that with the subs. Thank you so much.
[26:05.220 --> 26:11.880]  Oh, I can't remember. How can I remember? Oh, I lost 17,000 points. Fucking hell.
[26:11.880 --> 26:17.190]  Thank you.
[26:21.970 --> 26:28.330]  Wow, that was great. Multiplied that into not even a thousand.
[26:31.270 --> 26:32.430]  Look at him move.
[26:34.050 --> 26:34.970]  What happened?
[26:37.650 --> 26:42.890]  This is, I think, my favorite stream I've ever done. I fucking hate it. I hate it. I hate it.
[26:42.890 --> 26:45.850]  How could you ruin something that I loved for my childhood so much?
[26:46.750 --> 26:48.510]  It's you ruining it for you.
[26:49.370 --> 26:51.790]  This is you. This is all you.
[26:52.690 --> 26:53.290]  No!
[26:55.490 --> 26:56.090]  Fuck!
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.120]  I just cannot remember. All right. Oh, there you go, Nick.
[27:05.040 --> 27:05.420]  Okay.
[27:11.140 --> 27:15.480]  740. Wow. Excellent. Whoa, you got so much air, Gavin. That was crazy.
[27:16.920 --> 27:20.360]  Times four, times five. Oh my god, I cannot. Okay, there you go.
[27:23.500 --> 27:27.080]  I'm an idiot. I just cannot did it. I do not know what is wrong with my brain.
[27:28.010 --> 27:37.460]  Gavin, it's like in the snow. Okay, you're back on. Oh, you got the grind going. Yeah.
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.260]  Dead. Why did you jump that way? Oh, that works.
[27:47.780 --> 27:49.260]  I just...
[27:49.260 --> 27:54.020]  Oh, god.
[27:55.020 --> 27:59.080]  We're almost halfway through. Will they hit a quarter of the way to a million?
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.140]  They need a big combo.
[28:04.140 --> 28:07.740]  Surely we can't put this out as a VOD. This is absolutely the VOD.
[28:09.040 --> 28:11.280]  This is the greatest VOD we've ever made.
[28:11.300 --> 28:12.200]  How did that...
[28:13.440 --> 28:14.980]  I'm gonna burn myself.
[28:16.780 --> 28:19.820]  Such a dogshit VOD on a dogshit stream.
[28:21.280 --> 28:22.860]  You guys gotta pull it together.
[28:22.860 --> 28:24.320]  For the people.
[28:26.320 --> 28:29.180]  This is bad even for us.
[28:34.260 --> 28:38.660]  I wish that I'd taken the time earlier to learn the fucking controls again.
[28:39.780 --> 28:44.760]  You literally could stand in place and do this. You don't even need to skate.
[28:45.680 --> 28:46.200]  Just...
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.500]  Just manual and hit your control buttons. Hit the face buttons.
[28:51.800 --> 28:53.640]  You literally don't need to move.
[28:54.260 --> 28:55.060]  Hit the face buttons? What the fuck?
[28:55.060 --> 28:58.260]  X, Y, B, A. Mainly X, Y, or B.
[29:00.560 --> 29:01.800]  I'm not moving.
[29:06.340 --> 29:07.300]  182,000.
[29:07.420 --> 29:09.940]  I'm just gonna stay still to try to prove my point.
[29:10.060 --> 29:12.020]  You don't need to skate around even.
[29:12.340 --> 29:13.980]  You could just be still.
[29:14.600 --> 29:15.460]  But that's not...
[29:15.460 --> 29:17.060]  I don't understand that it's fun.
[29:17.180 --> 29:17.900]  How is that fun?
[29:18.760 --> 29:22.260]  I'm just saying that you don't need to make it as complicated.
[29:22.260 --> 29:25.620]  Cause you're chaining tricks and you're trying to balance it.
[29:26.400 --> 29:28.320]  You're trying to balance manually.
[29:28.660 --> 29:29.560]  What are you talking about?
[29:30.260 --> 29:31.460]  48,000.
[29:31.840 --> 29:34.120]  I got a question. How do you be still?
[29:35.060 --> 29:36.700]  Just hold back on the stick.
[29:37.080 --> 29:37.860]  And then what?
[29:38.200 --> 29:39.920]  And then you stop moving.
[29:41.460 --> 29:44.580]  I'm pushing face buttons and nothing is happening.
[29:45.380 --> 29:47.380]  I don't know what you did to your controls.
[29:49.280 --> 29:49.880]  Look.
[29:49.880 --> 29:52.500]  I hit B, nothing. Hit X, nothing.
[29:52.680 --> 29:53.640]  Hit Y, nothing.
[29:54.380 --> 29:56.360]  How do you manual if you're holding down though?
[29:56.380 --> 29:57.320]  Wouldn't you just fall off?
[30:00.560 --> 30:02.800]  You stop moving and then you initiate a manual.
[30:04.060 --> 30:05.480]  And you start balancing.
[30:06.520 --> 30:07.580]  Alright, I'm doing a manual.
[30:07.720 --> 30:09.900]  You need to find the game manual is what you need to find.
[30:10.400 --> 30:11.140]  Alright, I'm holding that.
[30:12.060 --> 30:12.680]  There you go, Nick.
[30:16.320 --> 30:17.900]  It's still a balancing game.
[30:18.500 --> 30:19.980]  You don't have to balance.
[30:20.180 --> 30:21.980]  I never said you don't have to balance.
[30:22.200 --> 30:23.640]  I said you don't need to be skating around.
[30:24.040 --> 30:25.540]  You said those things.
[30:26.820 --> 30:28.920]  You said those very words to me.
[30:29.560 --> 30:32.940]  I said you don't need to skate around and try for jumps.
[30:33.060 --> 30:34.080]  You can just be stationary.
[30:35.580 --> 30:36.880]  And then this land tricks.
[30:40.880 --> 30:42.140]  Gavin, how are you doing?
[30:42.840 --> 30:44.480]  I'm great because I'm not being filmed.
[30:46.740 --> 30:48.160]  This is some horseshit.
[30:48.160 --> 30:49.740]  I think Nick's VOD might mysteriously disappear.
[30:51.280 --> 30:55.400]  If you're watching this live, it might be the only time anyone ever sees this.
[31:05.480 --> 31:06.700]  Alright, let's see.
[31:07.680 --> 31:08.580]  Alright, into a manual.
[31:08.720 --> 31:09.460]  Nope, didn't count it.
[31:14.500 --> 31:15.540]  I'm just...
[31:15.540 --> 31:16.620]  really bad.
[31:18.560 --> 31:20.660]  I'm not reading the chat because I think it'll make me madder.
[31:21.900 --> 31:25.180]  It's everyone saying you're doing great and there are no idiot flags.
[31:25.280 --> 31:26.280]  Everything's perfect.
[31:32.860 --> 31:34.460]  I have arthritis.
[31:40.020 --> 31:41.080]  Catch the...
[31:41.080 --> 31:41.660]  You idiot.
[31:41.900 --> 31:43.400]  You sausage.
[31:43.760 --> 31:44.640]  You dumb shit.
[31:47.040 --> 31:48.560]  Flippin' hell, moron.
[31:48.680 --> 31:49.860]  Dumbass dipshit.
[31:50.850 --> 31:51.160]  Fuckface.
[31:51.900 --> 31:53.060]  That was our old shot.
[31:54.140 --> 31:55.480]  No bleep here.
[31:55.700 --> 31:56.860]  Did I just land that?
[31:57.540 --> 32:01.500]  Catch the frail, Nick!
[32:01.620 --> 32:02.480]  Come on!
[32:13.580 --> 32:14.460]  Dummy!
[32:16.500 --> 32:23.730]  No, no.
[32:25.750 --> 32:26.630]  No!
[32:27.050 --> 32:27.490]  Idiot.
[32:39.920 --> 32:40.860]  It's so quiet.
[32:40.860 --> 32:43.640]  Maybe we stop when the two of you combine for a million.
[32:46.200 --> 32:47.960]  Are you having fun, Gavin?
[32:50.120 --> 32:51.200]  I'm so hot.
[32:51.220 --> 32:54.380]  I don't think I've ever seen YouTube be more horror than anything.
[32:54.960 --> 32:56.660]  I haven't even seen it, I'm so hot.
[32:56.820 --> 32:58.040]  I'm sweating.
[33:00.320 --> 33:01.260]  I'm sweating.
[33:06.540 --> 33:07.180]  Okay.
[33:09.720 --> 33:11.940]  I have made no progress
[33:11.940 --> 33:13.460]  despite chaining some shit.
[33:14.380 --> 33:18.180]  But I keep forgetting to do the other...
[33:18.180 --> 33:19.100]  You idiot!
[33:19.360 --> 33:19.900]  You idiot!
[33:20.180 --> 33:20.680]  You dummy!
[33:20.880 --> 33:21.460]  You dumb shit!
[33:21.660 --> 33:23.140]  You fuckin' moron!
[33:23.540 --> 33:23.820]  Why?
[33:24.460 --> 33:27.020]  What is wrong with your fuckin' brain and fingers?
[33:27.820 --> 33:28.060]  Why?
[33:28.060 --> 33:31.860]  Why do you insist on being so stupid?
[33:33.260 --> 33:35.000]  Brain and fingers.
[33:37.580 --> 33:38.060]  No!
[33:41.860 --> 33:42.780]  What the hell?
[33:49.440 --> 33:50.880]  What are the cheat codes?
[33:50.980 --> 33:52.000]  There used to be cheats for this game.
[33:52.800 --> 33:53.180]  There were.
[33:53.420 --> 33:54.620]  Yeah, you activate those with the menu.
[34:00.100 --> 34:01.020]  Do-do-do-do.
[34:07.820 --> 34:08.440]  Idiot.
[34:09.340 --> 34:10.200]  Fuckin' idiot.
[34:10.800 --> 34:12.020]  Nah, I'm kidding. Maybe.
[34:19.220 --> 34:20.580]  You're so stupid.
[34:20.740 --> 34:21.480]  Why are you so stupid?
[34:23.040 --> 34:24.840]  Andrew's chaining at 30.
[34:25.740 --> 34:28.260]  It's not that hard.
[34:29.340 --> 34:31.980]  You keep laughing. It is not funny.
[34:33.100 --> 34:34.340]  I mean, it is very funny.
[34:35.080 --> 34:36.740]  I did a nose manual for 12.
[34:37.360 --> 34:38.220]  There you go.
[34:41.260 --> 34:42.340]  Okay. Oops.
[34:52.900 --> 34:56.340]  So you both haven't played this since it originally came out?
[34:58.260 --> 34:59.080]  Can you tell?
[34:59.380 --> 34:59.740]  Me too.
[35:01.600 --> 35:03.820]  I used to play Alcatraz a lot, though.
[35:03.980 --> 35:04.560]  On GameCube.
[35:07.240 --> 35:07.640]  Alright.
[35:07.880 --> 35:09.400]  Guess the manual ended there for some reason.
[35:09.660 --> 35:10.140]  And I died.
[35:10.900 --> 35:11.900]  Oh no, you died?
[35:12.800 --> 35:14.040]  I mean, that would be dark.
[35:14.180 --> 35:15.620]  I'd like to in this moment.
[35:16.520 --> 35:19.500]  I would like to somehow see footage of me playing this when I was younger.
[35:19.980 --> 35:20.960]  And see what I was doing.
[35:24.480 --> 35:26.940]  A question of, did you ever know how to do this?
[35:27.760 --> 35:28.280]  Maybe not.
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.100]  Yeah, well...
[35:33.880 --> 35:34.780]  I don't remember.
[35:34.800 --> 35:36.360]  That's fine. That would accidentally end it anyway.
[35:36.520 --> 35:37.240]  That was too high of a combo.
[35:38.040 --> 35:38.280]  Oops.
[35:46.150 --> 35:46.830]  You're an idiot.
[35:50.150 --> 35:51.970]  I'm going to get right to the edge of it.
[35:58.550 --> 36:00.410]  I just cannot remember.
[36:06.540 --> 36:07.500]  Flippin'. Trickin'.
[36:10.300 --> 36:10.780]  Spinnin'.
[36:10.780 --> 36:11.680]  Loopin' around the board.
[36:13.760 --> 36:15.580]  Okay, that's 954,000.
[36:17.020 --> 36:18.740]  We'll let the chat decide.
[36:18.980 --> 36:20.360]  Do we want to finish?
[36:20.520 --> 36:22.560]  Do you want me to just end this and move to another hawk?
[36:22.620 --> 36:25.420]  Or do you want to keep watching them try to get closer to a million?
[36:26.440 --> 36:27.400]  I've just...
[36:28.600 --> 36:30.400]  Keep going. End it.
[36:31.120 --> 36:32.580]  Yes, Andrew, end this.
[36:32.580 --> 36:33.420]  Please end it.
[36:36.500 --> 36:37.720]  New game. New game.
[36:37.760 --> 36:39.120]  Do not end. Finish them.
[36:39.200 --> 36:40.280]  Oh my god, end this.
[36:40.380 --> 36:41.580]  No, Andrew, never end it.
[36:41.680 --> 36:42.400]  Please, new game.
[36:43.760 --> 36:47.080]  Yeah, like a completely different game?
[36:47.260 --> 36:49.100]  No, a different game type.
[36:49.380 --> 36:49.600]  Oh.
[36:52.240 --> 36:53.480]  I'd be down to listen to either.
[36:54.060 --> 36:54.940]  Can we do a poll?
[36:56.000 --> 36:56.940]  We can do a poll, right?
[36:58.380 --> 37:00.560]  I just want to see what the poll results will be.
[37:01.240 --> 37:02.860]  I mean, there's definitely a funny answer.
[37:04.480 --> 37:04.960]  Cowards.
[37:06.840 --> 37:08.080]  First time chatter.
[37:08.420 --> 37:09.360]  Andrew, end it.
[37:09.500 --> 37:10.840]  For the love of god.
[37:10.980 --> 37:12.960]  Somebody that has never chatted before.
[37:13.160 --> 37:14.140]  It's like, this is it.
[37:16.820 --> 37:19.440]  This is my time. I need my opinions to be known.
[37:19.820 --> 37:20.680]  Okay, current poll.
[37:23.320 --> 37:24.820]  End it, question mark.
[37:27.020 --> 37:29.560]  I am just so stupid.
[37:30.880 --> 37:33.800]  Let me try to view this poll.
[37:37.940 --> 37:39.600]  So curious what it'll say.
[37:39.700 --> 37:41.140]  I'm so annoyed right now.
[37:41.320 --> 37:42.120]  That sucks.
[37:43.160 --> 37:45.400]  What's a sack tap and why did I only...
[37:47.640 --> 37:50.560]  Wow, it is 50-50 right now.
[37:50.660 --> 37:51.800]  Yes, 49%.
[37:51.800 --> 37:53.400]  No, 51%.
[37:55.100 --> 37:57.400]  There's two types of people in the world.
[37:57.910 --> 37:58.220]  Haha.
[38:03.740 --> 38:06.720]  End it is currently no with 51.
[38:07.900 --> 38:12.800]  Poll ended with no winning with 51% of the vote.
[38:14.020 --> 38:16.620]  133 to 129.
[38:17.020 --> 38:19.220]  Like no end it or no don't end it?
[38:19.520 --> 38:20.360]  Don't end it.
[38:20.420 --> 38:22.320]  The question was end it, yes or no.
[38:22.380 --> 38:24.220]  And they said no. It's continuing.
[38:24.740 --> 38:26.220]  We're going around.
[38:27.660 --> 38:29.920]  We'll revisit the poll in 10 minutes
[38:29.920 --> 38:31.480]  when we see where you're at.
[38:37.040 --> 38:38.720]  I can't believe that.
[38:38.920 --> 38:40.080]  51 to 49.
[38:40.720 --> 38:42.240]  A four vote difference.
[38:42.340 --> 38:44.340]  The most polarizing streak.
[38:46.440 --> 38:49.520]  Chugs McTugs with the subs, thank you so much.
[38:51.240 --> 38:52.160]  Save your money.
[38:58.500 --> 39:01.080]  Nick, please, for the love of God, use reverts.
[39:01.760 --> 39:03.280]  Just don't ignore that.
[39:03.740 --> 39:04.760]  Reverts are too much right now.
[39:07.060 --> 39:09.860]  Scott Steiner Shoney's gifted two subs, thank you.
[39:10.060 --> 39:11.560]  I don't know what that means.
[39:11.760 --> 39:12.240]  What does it mean?
[39:12.440 --> 39:15.380]  Candy Desk Official with the subs, thank you so much.
[39:18.460 --> 39:21.000]  The stream doesn't end until they hit one million.
[39:22.180 --> 39:22.660]  Together?
[39:24.880 --> 39:26.100]  God damn it, dude.
[39:26.100 --> 39:27.820]  What is wrong with my head?
[39:27.900 --> 39:31.520]  I don't understand why I cannot just chain this to my hands.
[39:43.260 --> 39:44.340]  Gavin, help me.
[39:44.820 --> 39:45.640]  What am I doing?
[39:45.880 --> 39:46.720]  What are you doing?
[39:46.860 --> 39:48.540]  I fell in a bin.
[39:49.300 --> 39:51.220]  Braxerman with the subs, thank you so much.
[39:51.320 --> 39:52.500]  I shouldn't have put this on Canada.
[39:52.640 --> 39:54.900]  You guys are never going to visit here now.
[39:56.460 --> 39:57.300]  Fudge, you papa.
[40:00.800 --> 40:01.260]  Whoops.
[40:02.820 --> 40:04.400]  I'm so irritated.
[40:05.300 --> 40:06.500]  I just cannot figure
[40:06.500 --> 40:07.740]  what chains and what does not.
[40:11.300 --> 40:11.760]  I...
[40:11.760 --> 40:14.160]  Gavin, if we'd hit each other at full speed
[40:14.160 --> 40:15.540]  both our characters would have died.
[40:16.840 --> 40:18.400]  Maybe our scores would have combined
[40:18.400 --> 40:20.400]  and we would have...
[40:23.520 --> 40:24.160]  You're a
[40:24.160 --> 40:25.460]  fucking moron.
[40:25.900 --> 40:27.760]  Merc wants me to tell you, Nick, that
[40:27.760 --> 40:29.900]  he doesn't think you quite know the value
[40:29.900 --> 40:32.060]  in double tapping face buttons while balancing.
[40:32.760 --> 40:33.680]  Please tell you that.
[40:34.160 --> 40:36.060]  I swear to God.
[40:38.440 --> 40:39.000]  Whoops.
[40:40.300 --> 40:40.580]  Alright.
[40:44.660 --> 40:46.520]  Alright, it bounced me back the other way.
[40:46.740 --> 40:47.120]  That's cool.
[40:50.690 --> 40:52.430]  Forgot to hit the Y button again?
[40:53.870 --> 40:56.230]  This is the craziest stream I've ever done.
[40:56.570 --> 40:57.730]  This is fantastic.
[40:57.730 --> 41:00.550]  I just cannot remember to do that.
[41:00.590 --> 41:00.870]  Okay.
[41:04.850 --> 41:05.730]  Okay, now...
[41:05.730 --> 41:09.050]  I've said this a few times, but I think maybe I'm getting it.
[41:09.150 --> 41:10.730]  I feel the chats behind it.
[41:10.770 --> 41:11.670]  They're saying he's getting it.
[41:12.450 --> 41:13.250]  He's locking in.
[41:13.550 --> 41:14.710]  Oh, Gavin with the times 11!
[41:15.770 --> 41:16.650]  Times 12!
[41:18.210 --> 41:18.650]  13!
[41:19.850 --> 41:20.730]  Oh, I lost it.
[41:21.050 --> 41:21.650]  Holy shit!
[41:21.890 --> 41:23.030]  Yeah, but you got double digits.
[41:23.030 --> 41:23.210]  No!
[41:24.870 --> 41:25.670]  Dumb shit!
[41:26.150 --> 41:27.930]  Oh, I just got an AFK warning.
[41:28.030 --> 41:29.530]  I gotta start actually moving the controller.
[41:31.230 --> 41:31.750]  No!
[41:32.030 --> 41:33.830]  I forgot how to train it again.
[41:33.950 --> 41:35.650]  Why? Why can't I remember?
[41:37.250 --> 41:38.550]  You're so dumb.
[41:38.670 --> 41:39.470]  You dumb fuck.
[41:39.530 --> 41:40.030]  Look at you.
[41:40.190 --> 41:43.130]  Look at you, you old dumb shit.
[41:43.370 --> 41:44.970]  You fucking dumb fuck.
[41:45.630 --> 41:47.170]  No! You did it again!
[41:48.410 --> 41:49.290]  You dumb shit!
[41:49.290 --> 41:50.070]  Why?
[41:57.710 --> 42:00.390]  I just keep forgetting.
[42:06.020 --> 42:07.470]  Nick, you can do this.
[42:08.290 --> 42:09.610]  We believe in you.
[42:10.170 --> 42:10.790]  Shut up!
[42:16.450 --> 42:19.150]  I keep forgetting about that!
[42:23.870 --> 42:24.830]  Come here, Nick.
[42:28.310 --> 42:31.670]  Somebody said, I love that Nick is having a midlife crisis as Tony Hawk.
[42:33.130 --> 42:33.930]  But you're not.
[42:34.090 --> 42:35.290]  You're not playing as Tony Hawk.
[42:35.390 --> 42:36.230]  Not even Tony Hawk.
[42:37.250 --> 42:37.490]  Ow!
[42:46.560 --> 42:48.120]  Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy.
[42:48.340 --> 42:50.300]  Dummy. Dummy. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.
[42:50.620 --> 42:52.120]  Dumb! Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.
[42:53.080 --> 42:54.200]  Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.
[42:54.340 --> 42:55.000]  Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.
[42:56.020 --> 42:56.820]  Ah, shit!
[43:02.470 --> 43:03.890]  What does that mean?
[43:05.930 --> 43:07.250]  If you use the revert.
[43:07.430 --> 43:08.590]  R2, what the fuck?
[43:10.590 --> 43:12.270]  You can revert, so it's like
[43:12.270 --> 43:13.330]  if you're coming off a ramp
[43:13.330 --> 43:15.410]  and you want to chain between jumps
[43:15.410 --> 43:16.710]  you click right trigger and you spin.
[43:18.090 --> 43:20.050]  You click right trigger.
[43:22.710 --> 43:22.910]  No!
[43:24.630 --> 43:25.350]  I see.
[43:26.850 --> 43:28.470]  Alright, that's terrible. Get off of this!
[43:28.530 --> 43:30.250]  This whole area sucks. Go back the other way.
[43:31.550 --> 43:33.070]  One minute, we'll do another poll.
[43:34.830 --> 43:35.630]  See if...
[43:37.810 --> 43:39.310]  There's been enough pain.
[43:45.100 --> 43:46.840]  Idiot. Dummy. Dumb. Dumb.
[43:46.980 --> 43:48.160]  Dummy. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.
[43:53.420 --> 43:54.220]  I really...
[43:54.220 --> 43:54.600]  Suck.
[44:05.000 --> 44:05.380]  Whoops!
[44:11.080 --> 44:11.520]  Whoops!
[44:20.220 --> 44:21.980]  Just sat here in silence.
[44:23.560 --> 44:25.160]  Just going, whoops!
[44:25.800 --> 44:26.560]  I'm just reading the chat.
[44:26.640 --> 44:28.900]  I'm getting ready for another poll. Let's do another poll.
[44:29.460 --> 44:30.480]  Should we end this?
[44:30.860 --> 44:32.680]  You know what they're gonna say.
[44:32.980 --> 44:34.780]  Oh, we gotta see what the poll wants to say.
[44:34.860 --> 44:36.380]  This is an audience stream.
[44:36.900 --> 44:38.260]  Let the VOD decide.
[44:38.260 --> 44:40.820]  God bless America!
[44:41.920 --> 44:43.920]  Someone just said I forgot Gavin was here.
[44:51.200 --> 44:53.340]  It's sometimes funny being so worthless.
[44:53.600 --> 44:55.280]  Oh, I just lost 58,000 points.
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.060]  Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
[45:01.100 --> 45:02.720]  Thank you Bubba for the subs.
[45:03.140 --> 45:03.780]  Stupid shit.
[45:04.240 --> 45:05.180]  Dummy. Dumb. Dumb.
[45:05.180 --> 45:06.040]  Never stop, never surrender.
[45:16.840 --> 45:18.360]  I don't know how to...
[45:19.320 --> 45:20.040]  It doesn't matter.
[45:24.800 --> 45:26.200]  How do I make a poll?
[45:30.440 --> 45:31.240]  Gavin's getting it now.
[45:31.340 --> 45:32.280]  Thank you Rare Exotic Pigeon.
[45:33.100 --> 45:34.060]  Gavin's climbing a little bit.
[45:37.500 --> 45:38.320]  Get off the thing.
[45:38.940 --> 45:39.720]  Okay, here we go.
[45:39.780 --> 45:40.980]  New poll is up!
[45:44.120 --> 45:44.740]  End it.
[45:45.600 --> 45:48.220]  No currently leading with 70% of the vote.
[45:48.240 --> 45:49.420]  Come on.
[45:50.240 --> 45:52.000]  Oh, but it's swinging. Yes.
[45:52.340 --> 45:53.140]  It's climbing.
[45:54.200 --> 45:54.880]  36.
[45:58.780 --> 46:00.080]  Oh, yes.
[46:00.100 --> 46:01.000]  It's gaining momentum.
[46:01.800 --> 46:02.460]  Thank God.
[46:05.040 --> 46:07.380]  Remember when we found the hawk? That was fun.
[46:09.900 --> 46:11.120]  40% yes.
[46:13.260 --> 46:14.440]  Gavin, remember hawk?
[46:14.800 --> 46:16.640]  Yeah, this is good too though.
[46:17.800 --> 46:18.440]  Oh yeah?
[46:18.880 --> 46:19.720]  It's climbing.
[46:20.380 --> 46:25.080]  Why don't you hit record on your...
[46:25.080 --> 46:32.160]  God damn it.
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.660]  I didn't chain that because I'm stupid.
[46:34.280 --> 46:36.400]  Oh, the time's running out on the poll.
[46:38.120 --> 46:38.760]  Who's winning?
[46:38.780 --> 46:39.680]  And we have the results.
[46:39.820 --> 46:42.080]  It's more one-sided than it was before.
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.120]  With 58% of the votes.
[46:45.120 --> 46:45.720]  No.
[46:50.810 --> 46:51.450]  Oops.
[46:52.850 --> 46:54.890]  I wanted to be clear that
[46:54.890 --> 46:57.230]  one million is the second slider
[46:57.230 --> 46:58.190]  you could do for this.
[46:58.270 --> 46:59.930]  I think it starts at 500,000.
[47:00.150 --> 47:02.250]  I clicked it once and there's like
[47:02.250 --> 47:04.490]  five other higher totals you could go to.
[47:06.370 --> 47:08.810]  A million is not like this insane
[47:08.810 --> 47:10.110]  number that I selected.
[47:10.950 --> 47:11.870]  That's fine.
[47:14.450 --> 47:15.090]  Whoopsie.
[47:16.890 --> 47:18.430]  Doesn't make it any better.
[47:19.470 --> 47:21.950]  I think you two could hit a million combined
[47:21.950 --> 47:23.630]  the way things are going by the end of this.
[47:25.350 --> 47:27.210]  You have 13 more minutes.
[47:28.350 --> 47:30.150]  Oh, there's a timer? Thank God.
[47:30.630 --> 47:31.850]  You know, wrap up.
[47:32.210 --> 47:32.690]  501.
[47:33.930 --> 47:34.610]  Oh, I see.
[47:35.770 --> 47:37.290]  It's been 48 minutes.
[47:37.590 --> 47:37.810]  Yeah.
[47:38.890 --> 47:40.410]  Time flies when you're having fun.
[47:41.050 --> 47:42.330]  I think I went into a fugue state.
[47:44.970 --> 47:46.290]  Does it get more squirrely
[47:46.290 --> 47:47.310]  when you do more tricks?
[47:48.350 --> 47:48.710]  Yeah.
[47:49.750 --> 47:51.050]  Well, the more time,
[47:51.130 --> 47:53.550]  you have a limit, essentially, to your manualing
[47:53.550 --> 47:55.110]  and your grinding, so the more you do it,
[47:55.150 --> 47:55.910]  the harder it becomes.
[47:56.830 --> 47:59.210]  My thumb hurts so bad right now.
[48:06.600 --> 48:07.360]  Oh, God.
[48:07.440 --> 48:08.940]  I suck. I suck. I suck. I suck.
[48:09.620 --> 48:11.440]  I never would have considered this
[48:11.440 --> 48:12.960]  if we didn't do this, but a Let's Play
[48:13.420 --> 48:15.160]  where you guys just have to keep playing
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.580]  until you get a million, like we talked about
[48:17.190 --> 48:18.780]  I feel like in a Let's Play,
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.040]  I would at least...
[48:21.040 --> 48:22.440]  I don't know, I would practice for it.
[48:22.560 --> 48:23.040]  Now.
[48:24.980 --> 48:27.080]  Although I may uninstall this game
[48:27.080 --> 48:27.860]  as soon as this is over.
[48:29.020 --> 48:30.960]  Gavin's embracing the standing in place.
[48:32.300 --> 48:33.140]  Oh, no.
[48:33.520 --> 48:34.880]  You missed it anyway.
[48:36.060 --> 48:37.060]  Oh, no.
[48:40.600 --> 48:41.840]  I just cannot
[48:42.740 --> 48:45.140]  get my brain to work
[48:45.140 --> 48:46.980]  with my hand, dude.
[48:50.500 --> 48:51.620]  It's just like
[48:53.200 --> 48:54.260]  soaking wet.
[49:04.460 --> 49:05.060]  Great.
[49:07.080 --> 49:07.860]  You could have
[49:07.860 --> 49:09.040]  chained that together better, fool.
[49:10.160 --> 49:12.060]  Idiot! Idiot! Moron!
[49:12.200 --> 49:14.260]  Stupid! Figure it out!
[49:14.680 --> 49:15.660]  Fool! Come on!
[49:15.660 --> 49:17.420]  Figure it out!
[49:18.220 --> 49:20.040]  Gavin, figure it out.
[49:22.980 --> 49:23.580]  Idiot!
[49:25.220 --> 49:26.520]  You know what?
[49:26.820 --> 49:28.880]  I'm gonna change the...
[49:28.880 --> 49:29.120]  Whoops.
[49:33.440 --> 49:34.780]  Turn that dumb shit off.
[49:35.600 --> 49:36.920]  What are you turning off?
[49:37.500 --> 49:39.080]  That inverted X axis.
[49:39.380 --> 49:39.680]  Oh, okay.
[49:41.900 --> 49:43.820]  It would be so much funnier
[49:43.820 --> 49:45.460]  if that other thing that we've done had come out.
[49:54.520 --> 49:55.080]  Idiot!
[49:56.740 --> 49:58.860]  Most I've laughed on a stream.
[50:00.680 --> 50:03.040]  Really? I feel like Pico Park has that one.
[50:06.640 --> 50:09.100]  Hey, you guys got 11 minutes!
[50:10.960 --> 50:13.460]  Are you for real? It's been that long?
[50:13.600 --> 50:14.100]  Yes.
[50:14.500 --> 50:15.900]  I keep losing time.
[50:15.900 --> 50:15.940]  Damn.
[50:18.340 --> 50:19.360]  You almost have
[50:19.360 --> 50:20.420]  800,000.
[50:21.640 --> 50:23.080]  Between the two of you.
[50:23.260 --> 50:25.200]  Way to catch the wall, dummy.
[50:25.500 --> 50:28.000]  If I get half a million, I feel like my work's done, right?
[50:28.720 --> 50:29.480]  Yeah! No.
[50:29.980 --> 50:31.820]  No. I mean, you gotta keep going to help.
[50:32.060 --> 50:33.100]  You know, being a good teammate.
[50:33.560 --> 50:34.660]  Oh, so my work's not done?
[50:35.040 --> 50:35.360]  Oh, okay.
[50:38.660 --> 50:39.460]  I cannot
[50:40.280 --> 50:41.740]  remember the fucking
[50:41.740 --> 50:43.300]  controls. I do not know.
[50:43.300 --> 50:44.780]  This is...
[50:44.780 --> 50:45.880]  Guys, I think I might be in trouble.
[50:46.840 --> 50:49.260]  A little rusty, but that's okay.
[50:51.880 --> 50:52.940]  I meant medically.
[50:59.460 --> 51:00.000]  Whoops.
[51:10.940 --> 51:11.480]  Alright.
[51:12.490 --> 51:13.760]  Let's just practice this.
[51:14.560 --> 51:16.420]  There we go. Let's go see. Let's watch.
[51:18.780 --> 51:19.620]  Oh, yeah.
[51:19.740 --> 51:20.440]  Yeah, there you go, Nick.
[51:21.280 --> 51:22.640]  Hey, what do you got there?
[51:22.720 --> 51:23.360]  Oh, that's cool.
[51:24.240 --> 51:25.120]  Oh, you did?
[51:25.660 --> 51:27.300]  It looks really awesome, man.
[51:31.040 --> 51:32.340]  You put glue on it?
[51:33.340 --> 51:34.120]  What is it?
[51:35.460 --> 51:35.880]  Whoa!
[51:36.780 --> 51:37.980]  I can't believe Archie has to watch this.
[51:37.980 --> 51:38.780]  I'm moving a lot right now.
[51:41.040 --> 51:42.200]  How am I doing?
[51:42.620 --> 51:44.420]  Badly. I'm doing very badly.
[51:45.560 --> 51:47.300]  Nick, don't let him see you.
[51:48.160 --> 51:49.860]  He just said, oh my god.
[51:51.260 --> 51:52.000]  Are you...
[51:52.000 --> 51:52.960]  What do you think? Is it cool?
[51:54.180 --> 51:55.380]  Aw, good try, buddy.
[51:56.160 --> 51:57.940]  It is hard. Thank you, bud.
[51:58.060 --> 51:58.880]  You know what?
[52:00.840 --> 52:01.620]  What's the...
[52:01.620 --> 52:03.320]  Ah, damn. I forgot the joke. Never mind.
[52:05.840 --> 52:08.160]  From the mouths of babes. There it is.
[52:08.360 --> 52:09.400]  Alright, and edit that together.
[52:09.840 --> 52:10.900]  I've been following Gavin and it's just
[52:10.900 --> 52:13.220]  watching him fall after four tricks
[52:13.220 --> 52:14.200]  every time.
[52:14.680 --> 52:16.880]  He does four tricks, then he falls.
[52:17.560 --> 52:19.380]  I love it, kid. That's so cool.
[52:20.100 --> 52:21.120]  Thank you, bud.
[52:21.800 --> 52:23.120]  I'll hang on to it.
[52:23.140 --> 52:23.560]  Absolutely.
[52:25.580 --> 52:26.860]  Oh, man.
[52:28.020 --> 52:28.240]  Whoops.
[52:30.060 --> 52:31.000]  Oh, it's a little
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.280]  tumble over there.
[52:32.400 --> 52:33.420]  Tumble by Gavin.
[52:36.260 --> 52:36.620]  Oh,
[52:36.720 --> 52:38.780]  going down the hill now. That's fancy.
[52:38.780 --> 52:40.900]  Oh, are you grinding?
[52:41.720 --> 52:42.420]  Yeah!
[52:44.430 --> 52:44.820]  Oops.
[52:46.380 --> 52:48.360]  Aw, shucks, buddy.
[52:49.860 --> 52:51.100]  Good try.
[52:59.900 --> 53:07.340]  Oh, idiot.
[53:07.760 --> 53:11.020]  I just want you to hit half a million so badly.
[53:11.120 --> 53:12.320]  I'm just watching for it.
[53:12.320 --> 53:14.260]  There you go, there you go, there you go.
[53:14.720 --> 53:16.100]  He's bouncing, he's doing
[53:16.100 --> 53:18.220]  manualing. Alright, didn't work.
[53:19.680 --> 53:19.920]  Oh.
[53:23.940 --> 53:24.820]  He tried.
[53:25.700 --> 53:28.180]  Alright, I'm going back here. This seems to be the best spot for me.
[53:28.680 --> 53:30.060]  Alright, he tried once again.
[53:39.040 --> 53:39.480]  Idiot!
[53:39.480 --> 53:39.880]  Idiot!
[53:43.040 --> 53:43.840]  He's gone, right?
[53:50.700 --> 53:53.860]  Oh, that looked really cool, Nick.
[53:54.800 --> 53:56.040]  Oh, thank you.
[53:56.100 --> 53:58.540]  It wasn't worth points, but like genuinely, that looked awesome.
[53:59.320 --> 54:00.280]  Where did Gavin go?
[54:00.820 --> 54:02.540]  Oh, he's down there. Let's see what's going on with him.
[54:02.900 --> 54:04.480]  He's still trying to get half a mil.
[54:06.940 --> 54:08.100]  How does that reset?
[54:08.320 --> 54:09.760]  It's going into the manual!
[54:10.560 --> 54:11.300]  Damn it!
[54:12.300 --> 54:13.060]  You gotta revert.
[54:14.820 --> 54:15.500]  Did you?
[54:15.640 --> 54:16.520]  What did you just say to me?
[54:19.740 --> 54:21.220]  Revert, which is right trigger?
[54:21.640 --> 54:21.880]  Yeah.
[54:29.780 --> 54:30.500]  What's happening?
[54:31.000 --> 54:31.280]  Whoops!
[54:32.780 --> 54:34.460]  I saved them from their misery.
[54:35.840 --> 54:36.360]  Whoopsie!
[54:40.080 --> 54:40.600]  Whoopsie!
[54:41.500 --> 54:43.540]  You accidentally ended this video.
[54:44.320 --> 54:46.260]  I was trying to confirm the revert.
[54:46.520 --> 54:49.800]  I just saved you guys a little bit.
[54:50.080 --> 54:52.820]  You know, five more minutes of time that you had saved.
[54:56.240 --> 54:56.940]  Oh, man.
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.320]  That's so tragic.
[54:59.100 --> 55:00.860]  Gavin, I don't know who to apologize to.
[55:02.100 --> 55:04.540]  But I feel like it's owed to someone.
[55:05.200 --> 55:05.980]  Yeah, everyone.
[55:06.820 --> 55:08.480]  Let's end this with a hawk.
[55:08.480 --> 55:09.640]  One final hawk.
[55:09.800 --> 55:11.740]  I might call my grandparents and apologize.
[55:11.960 --> 55:13.140]  They don't even know about it.
[55:15.420 --> 55:15.900]  Okay.
[55:16.060 --> 55:16.980]  Let's go hawk.
[55:18.420 --> 55:20.580]  I think we've seen enough of Canada.
[55:22.840 --> 55:23.800]  Hey, Shippy2929.
[55:24.060 --> 55:25.680]  Thanks for all the stories.
[55:25.740 --> 55:26.500]  Thank you so much, Shippy.
[55:27.400 --> 55:28.360]  I can't look.
[55:28.780 --> 55:29.860]  We're going to Alcatraz!
[55:30.580 --> 55:31.760]  This is one of my favorite maps.
[55:32.320 --> 55:36.860]  A nice size map to hide those hawks.
[55:36.860 --> 55:39.220]  You have 20 seconds to scout.
[55:41.260 --> 55:42.840]  Wow, this is huge.
[55:43.080 --> 55:43.820]  Big ol' map, isn't it?
[55:45.200 --> 55:45.560]  Yeah.
[55:46.880 --> 55:47.680]  Oh, whoops.
[55:48.180 --> 55:49.000]  I did a cowbunga.
[55:50.540 --> 55:52.640]  Oh, now I'm getting cool tricks and shit.
[55:52.940 --> 55:53.100]  Yeah.
[55:54.640 --> 55:56.540]  You weren't used to the cold, is what it was.
[55:56.620 --> 55:57.900]  It threw off your whole skate game.
[56:00.120 --> 56:00.520]  No!
[56:00.960 --> 56:01.300]  Death!
[56:03.720 --> 56:04.520]  Okay, here we go.
[56:06.860 --> 56:07.060]  Ugh.
[56:09.940 --> 56:11.640]  Let's hide some oak.
[56:13.620 --> 56:15.900]  If I do that, could that work?
[56:19.940 --> 56:21.020]  Oh, jeez.
[56:21.460 --> 56:22.440]  Oh, you moron!
[56:23.680 --> 56:24.480]  Not that way.
[56:24.880 --> 56:25.340]  This way.
[56:25.620 --> 56:27.060]  Do right.
[56:27.980 --> 56:29.300]  Whoa, whoa.
[56:29.900 --> 56:30.560]  Good luck with that.
[56:33.850 --> 56:34.990]  Oh, that's awesome.
[56:35.250 --> 56:38.890]  I didn't mean to do that.
[56:39.550 --> 56:40.710]  Hurry up, fool!
[56:47.770 --> 56:49.450]  This is very hard to navigate.
[56:50.170 --> 56:54.840]  So, Nick, what should we stream tomorrow
[56:54.840 --> 56:56.320]  to put out instead of this
[56:56.320 --> 56:57.520]  on Tuesday?
[56:58.620 --> 57:00.320]  You two have to do a make good stream.
[57:01.640 --> 57:02.600]  Dude, I'll make good
[57:02.600 --> 57:04.520]  every day of the week to get rid of this turd.
[57:05.520 --> 57:06.400]  Me too, man.
[57:06.780 --> 57:07.440]  Me too.
[57:11.550 --> 57:12.370]  Here we go.
[57:12.630 --> 57:13.510]  I see that K.
[57:14.030 --> 57:15.310]  Might be time to start
[57:15.310 --> 57:17.830]  our, uh...
[57:17.830 --> 57:19.570]  Start your secret show?
[57:20.010 --> 57:20.210]  Yeah.
[57:21.750 --> 57:23.310]  Put out the first one as a
[57:23.310 --> 57:24.630]  as a teaser.
[57:25.410 --> 57:26.370]  Just instantly.
[57:27.490 --> 57:28.990]  So that people forget about this.
[57:29.150 --> 57:31.330]  Oh, I found an A. Oh, I missed it.
[57:31.490 --> 57:31.710]  Oh.
[57:33.890 --> 57:34.830]  I'm stuck in the wall.
[57:35.410 --> 57:35.890]  No!
[57:36.850 --> 57:38.170]  Circle? There we go.
[57:38.630 --> 57:40.230]  I don't think anyone's going to find my letters.
[57:43.750 --> 57:44.790]  What color are you?
[57:45.510 --> 57:45.910]  Blue.
[57:47.150 --> 57:47.630]  Oh, okay.
[57:48.810 --> 57:50.410]  So far, I haven't.
[57:52.870 --> 57:54.250]  You know, what's nice is that after
[57:54.250 --> 57:56.310]  watching you guys go for the million, it's really
[57:56.310 --> 57:58.250]  narrowed where I think you would put it.
[57:59.830 --> 58:02.270]  What the fuck does that mean?
[58:02.850 --> 58:04.450]  It means I'm not having to look at, like,
[58:04.470 --> 58:05.930]  areas you'd have to jump up to.
[58:08.790 --> 58:09.470]  Fair point.
[58:11.410 --> 58:12.830]  I didn't really find any.
[58:12.910 --> 58:13.670]  That was a nick run.
[58:16.710 --> 58:17.850]  Good at hiding.
[58:18.110 --> 58:18.870]  No one found my letters.
[58:20.050 --> 58:21.530]  I don't think anyone found mine, either.
[58:34.020 --> 58:34.460]  Yeah.
[58:42.110 --> 58:42.550]  Ow.
[58:46.900 --> 58:47.880]  Can I go down there?
[58:48.560 --> 58:49.540]  Oh yeah, that's where we started.
[58:50.440 --> 58:50.880]  Idiot.
[58:55.180 --> 58:56.200]  Oh, that was dumb.
[58:56.500 --> 58:57.060]  Why did I do that?
[58:58.800 --> 59:00.140]  Where's he putting his stuff?
[59:00.360 --> 59:01.560]  You're not allowed to see where I'm at.
[59:01.840 --> 59:03.620]  Where are you hiding them letters?
[59:05.660 --> 59:05.840]  Whoops.
[59:08.480 --> 59:09.920]  Is that what this VOD is called?
[59:10.040 --> 59:10.240]  Whoops.
[59:12.460 --> 59:13.340]  I think it's
[59:13.340 --> 59:15.120]  the one that shouldn't come out.
[59:16.160 --> 59:16.960]  It's the title.
[59:17.900 --> 59:20.140]  My hands don't do what my brain wants.
[59:22.820 --> 59:23.840]  They're really not...
[59:23.840 --> 59:24.680]  alright.
[59:26.260 --> 59:27.940]  Gavin, did you not plant all of them?
[59:27.960 --> 59:29.620]  Damn it to hell, Andrew!
[59:30.080 --> 59:30.640]  Thank you.
[59:31.520 --> 59:32.680]  Wait, you got four?
[59:33.660 --> 59:33.940]  Yeah.
[59:35.340 --> 59:36.140]  Where were they?
[59:36.960 --> 59:38.060]  Right at the front.
[59:39.360 --> 59:41.020]  Did you not plant them?
[59:41.220 --> 59:41.500]  No.
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.860]  I fell right as the timer ran.
[59:44.940 --> 59:46.220]  It just gave me three of them back.
[59:46.220 --> 59:46.400]  Whoa!
[59:50.600 --> 59:52.080]  It gave you three back?
[59:52.300 --> 59:52.600]  Yeah.
[59:54.980 --> 59:55.700]  Oh, man.
[59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.240]  Where the hell was Andrew through all of that?
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.820]  I think Nick was over where Gavin was at a lot of the time.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.000]  Alright, well, god, Gavin's.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.080]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:05.760]  Oh, died.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.300]  Where was Andrew during all of this?
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.440]  Hey, kid, what do you got there?
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.040]  What's that one?
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.180]  I can't hide.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.140]  Three eyes?
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.300]  It's an alien?
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.100]  Whoa!
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.820]  That's cool, dude.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.960]  I didn't really find Nick's.
[01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:34.930]  Go, final round.
[01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:36.070]  It's 5-0-1!
[01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:39.410]  5-0-1 the time of the week.
[01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.710]  I want to just shout out to Andrew
[01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:43.550]  for picking this game.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:45.010]  Yeah.
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.590]  Yeah, you know,
[01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:48.970]  I did say we were going to do this on Monday,
[01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:51.610]  so it was possible to prep for.
[01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:52.450]  I did.
[01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:53.970]  Oops.
[01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:57.310]  Put it in the Twitch chat that we have on Slack,
[01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:58.870]  and Eric said, that's a great idea!
[01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.610]  And then Eric, unfortunately,
[01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.630]  was unable to make it.
[01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.630]  I'm just going to follow one of you.
[01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.210]  Stop going through portals, fool!
[01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.090]  Where are you going?
[01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.370]  Where are you going, Gavin?
[01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.170]  I'm watching you. I've got my eyes on you.
[01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:17.150]  I'm following your line.
[01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:18.170]  That's not what I meant to do.
[01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.790]  You ain't see shit.
[01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:21.450]  I'm following you.
[01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:26.870]  I don't have time to chase Nick down,
[01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:27.890]  so I'm just going to stay with you.
[01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.250]  How many letters am I about to see at the spawn?
[01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:32.210]  That's the question.
[01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:34.690]  I think I got rid of them all.
[01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.930]  Thanks, bud.
[01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:38.690]  Did I not?
[01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.470]  Nick spawned on them.
[01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:42.050]  W-K.
[01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:44.770]  We spawned on them?
[01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:46.070]  We did.
[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:48.590]  Gavin, why?
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.490]  They were yours, weren't they?
[01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:51.730]  No.
[01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:54.050]  I guess they're red. Maybe they are Nick's.
[01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.650]  What? I planted them. Oh, I guess I fell.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.700]  That's irritating.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.040]  Gavin's W, I see it up there.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.180]  I think you should be invisible to the other players during hiding.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.520]  I agree.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.460]  Because Andrew just remembers.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.500]  Well, I just placed mine.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.020]  I'll even tell you where I put all mine,
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.340]  if you want to go find them.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.700]  I put them all in one spot.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:25.860]  Oh yeah?
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.240]  Oh yeah? Me too.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.380]  Off the spawn.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.060]  Oh, there's a boat?
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.280]  Yeah.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.620]  Nick, get them in the boat.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:37.840]  I don't know, where's the boat?
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.720]  It's at the spawn.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.340]  Oh, I see them all.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.440]  I see them.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.080]  I just put them there so I could follow you.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.320]  Andrew's the winner!
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.740]  What a great stream.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.840]  What a perfect way to end your week.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.400]  Thank you so much everyone who joined us.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.240]  Hold these two accountable.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.180]  If this VOD does not show up on Tuesday,
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.720]  you know whose fault it was.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.020]  Don't let them off the hook.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.440]  But until next week,
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.080]  what will we play?
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.140]  I don't know.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.480]  Maybe I'll have to let them decide,
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.780]  as a make good, for this.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.620]  Oh, can we get you to play whatever we want?
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.380]  Yeah, how about that?
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.500]  You guys pick whatever you want.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.980]  Nick's out next week, so it'll be whatever you want to play next week, Gavin.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:23.800]  I am?
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.040]  Are you not out next week, Nick?
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.520]  No, I leave Saturday.
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.520]  He leaves Saturday. Nick will be here. The two of them will collaborate.
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.560]  And we will see what Nick and Gavin want to play.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.420]  I'm excited. I hope you are too.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.720]  I'm thinking Andrew has to do...
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.780]  He has to do Halo 2 Lasso.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.000]  Yeah!
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.000]  That's fine, I've done that.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.080]  It's all good.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.100]  We'll play whatever.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.920]  But, we'll see what we play next week.
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:49.920]  Love you all so much!
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.000]  Bye!
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.360]  I'm getting it now.
