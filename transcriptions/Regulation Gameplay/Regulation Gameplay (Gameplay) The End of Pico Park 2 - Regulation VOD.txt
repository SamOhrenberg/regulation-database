[00:00.000 --> 00:02.240]  Just put a cream on it, you'll be fine.
[00:02.680 --> 00:06.560]  Yeah, well, I've been trying all sorts of creams, Geoff, and it's not working.
[00:07.220 --> 00:08.600]  It's topical only on the top.
[00:09.940 --> 00:11.340]  Oh, I've been using tropical.
[00:12.960 --> 00:13.800]  You got it.
[00:14.040 --> 00:16.900]  If you do not put a tropical cream on a topical sore,
[00:17.020 --> 00:18.280]  that's not what you want to do.
[00:19.080 --> 00:21.480]  If you use topical on your bottom, does that hurt?
[00:28.420 --> 00:29.960]  It's Gavin's birthday!
[00:33.060 --> 00:35.140]  It's a cream for Gavin!
[00:35.880 --> 00:37.620]  Whoa, Gavin!
[00:38.100 --> 00:38.840]  Birthday in the park.
[00:39.060 --> 00:39.880]  Happy birthday.
[00:40.260 --> 00:44.260]  The dark park is only getting darker as time goes.
[00:44.480 --> 00:48.720]  We are returning back to an evil park that I don't want to be at.
[00:48.780 --> 00:49.880]  I'd rather be anywhere else.
[00:50.200 --> 00:55.600]  We are doing it for Gavin's birthday to celebrate 21 years of life for Gavin.
[00:55.740 --> 00:56.080]  Incredible.
[00:56.600 --> 00:57.940]  Happy birthday, Gavin.
[00:58.500 --> 01:00.500]  Finally, old enough to drink.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.180]  I was listening to a clip where I was on the RT podcast,
[01:04.620 --> 01:07.660]  and Geoff was yelling at me for being a dumb 21-year-old.
[01:07.860 --> 01:12.980]  I assume at the time Geoff would have been 34, and now I'm 37.
[01:13.700 --> 01:14.180]  Wow.
[01:18.460 --> 01:20.860]  We really wrung a lot out of this friendship.
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.760]  We're squeezing every drop out of this lemon.
[01:25.760 --> 01:27.680]  We're getting the maximum juice.
[01:28.520 --> 01:30.960]  And boys, I think it's time to return.
[01:31.260 --> 01:32.800]  Are you ready for the dark park?
[01:33.060 --> 01:33.640]  I'm so ready.
[01:34.200 --> 01:39.380]  I believe, are we returning back to the level where I declared all the time in the world?
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.500]  We do have all the time in the world.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.140]  All the time in the world.
[01:46.740 --> 01:50.700]  But Tornado, 50 subs.
[01:51.580 --> 01:53.660]  Oh my god, thank you, Tornado.
[01:53.660 --> 01:54.920]  I didn't have the chat open.
[01:55.400 --> 01:57.200]  50 subs to beat Tornado.
[01:57.380 --> 01:59.560]  That must be a Gavin's birthday shout-out.
[01:59.980 --> 02:02.060]  Typically, a tornado is a bad thing.
[02:02.760 --> 02:04.900]  With the five gifted. This is crazy. This is wild.
[02:05.040 --> 02:06.240]  Let's get into it. It's the dark park.
[02:06.360 --> 02:08.640]  It's the final level on this part of Danger Park.
[02:08.920 --> 02:10.220]  The easiest level. Are you guys ready?
[02:10.960 --> 02:12.800]  Bottom one runs to the left, then right.
[02:12.920 --> 02:13.120]  Yep.
[02:13.340 --> 02:14.220]  Second one runs over.
[02:14.320 --> 02:15.340]  Wait, you remember this?
[02:15.840 --> 02:18.940]  Yes, of course I remember it. It's ingrained in my brain.
[02:18.940 --> 02:22.260]  It's ingrained in Gavin's brain.
[02:23.060 --> 02:24.620]  It's ingrained in Nick's brain.
[02:25.480 --> 02:27.800]  I don't remember this at all.
[02:28.720 --> 02:30.340]  Well, you know what we do?
[02:30.980 --> 02:33.060]  Go left, then right, if you're in the bottom.
[02:34.020 --> 02:35.860]  If you're in the very bottom, you go left.
[02:36.320 --> 02:36.520]  Oops.
[02:36.960 --> 02:37.320]  Sorry.
[02:38.520 --> 02:39.020]  That was me.
[02:39.100 --> 02:40.640]  We just gotta get in the hang of it.
[02:41.380 --> 02:43.220]  So we need a couple of people at the top, don't we?
[02:45.620 --> 02:46.220]  There you go.
[02:46.480 --> 02:46.600]  Oops.
[02:47.720 --> 02:48.900]  That's gonna be a long day.
[02:49.100 --> 02:52.040]  Then the second person needs to walk off to the next ledge.
[02:52.340 --> 02:53.640]  I gotta be somewhere tonight.
[02:54.060 --> 02:54.980]  Shit, sorry.
[02:55.200 --> 02:56.100]  Oh, at my birthday?
[02:58.640 --> 02:59.960]  Crackerjack, thank you for the 20 gift.
[03:00.280 --> 03:02.700]  Birthday festivities I'm not aware of?
[03:03.860 --> 03:04.420]  That was Geoff.
[03:05.160 --> 03:06.040]  Nah, we already had him.
[03:07.920 --> 03:08.360]  Adam.
[03:09.180 --> 03:09.580]  Adam.
[03:10.040 --> 03:10.180]  Oops.
[03:10.440 --> 03:10.980]  Get off me!
[03:12.140 --> 03:13.980]  I can't make the top jump anymore.
[03:15.120 --> 03:16.980]  You can if you're not the...
[03:17.540 --> 03:18.160]  Yep, don't...
[03:18.160 --> 03:21.340]  I'm not really sure why no one's going at the beginning.
[03:22.080 --> 03:23.000]  Seems like the bottom should go.
[03:23.000 --> 03:23.720]  It's unexpected.
[03:24.900 --> 03:25.180]  Here we go.
[03:25.880 --> 03:26.760]  Go green, go green.
[03:26.880 --> 03:28.620]  Stack, stack, stack, stack, stack, stack.
[03:28.760 --> 03:29.200]  We don't need to...
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.100]  Don't move over, Geoff!
[03:30.100 --> 03:31.740]  Why is green going?
[03:32.360 --> 03:34.060]  We're trying to get the key all the way to the top.
[03:35.080 --> 03:36.080]  We let the top person...
[03:37.280 --> 03:38.120]  Any thoughts, Gavin?
[03:38.960 --> 03:40.540]  I was listening to Nick.
[03:40.920 --> 03:41.300]  Oh, cool.
[03:44.280 --> 03:45.080]  That's on me.
[03:45.340 --> 03:46.260]  I take responsibility.
[03:46.680 --> 03:47.380]  Oh, my morgues.
[03:47.500 --> 03:48.860]  Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[03:49.240 --> 03:50.060]  Thank you.
[03:51.040 --> 03:51.980]  So are we stacked?
[03:52.240 --> 03:52.840]  Oh, no.
[03:53.700 --> 03:55.560]  Are we stacking at the top?
[03:55.740 --> 03:57.020]  Or are we just jumping at the top?
[03:57.020 --> 03:58.380]  Yeah, we stack and the person climbs up.
[03:58.640 --> 04:01.220]  Two people need to go...
[04:01.220 --> 04:03.840]  You're just not hot on the draw, bud.
[04:03.920 --> 04:05.460]  37 might be a rough age for you.
[04:06.720 --> 04:08.260]  36 is the last one.
[04:10.080 --> 04:11.900]  Make room for green.
[04:12.840 --> 04:13.400]  And he goes.
[04:13.400 --> 04:14.900]  Then I'll go up here.
[04:15.040 --> 04:16.700]  Yeah, but you don't need to wait that long, do you?
[04:18.280 --> 04:19.800]  You're concerned about the waiting?
[04:19.960 --> 04:21.560]  We can't even fucking get there.
[04:21.620 --> 04:22.480]  Thanks, Mark the Frog.
[04:24.100 --> 04:24.900]  Jesus Christ.
[04:25.860 --> 04:26.860]  This is going to be a long day.
[04:26.900 --> 04:27.620]  How come you're waiting?
[04:27.800 --> 04:28.620]  Are you out of your mind?
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.340]  We had...
[04:29.800 --> 04:30.900]  Let's live in the...
[04:30.900 --> 04:31.260]  Geoff!
[04:31.920 --> 04:34.960]  I was trying to draw up support.
[04:35.040 --> 04:35.660]  Don't try.
[04:36.080 --> 04:36.720]  Just do.
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.400]  All right, Yoda.
[04:39.700 --> 04:41.180]  Go, go, go, go.
[04:41.220 --> 04:41.800]  There we go.
[04:43.680 --> 04:44.240]  Oops.
[04:44.940 --> 04:45.820]  That's okay.
[04:46.480 --> 04:47.040]  Progress.
[04:47.560 --> 04:48.560]  Jugs McTugz is back.
[04:48.700 --> 04:49.400]  Jugs McTugz.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.300]  Thank you so much, Jugs.
[04:51.860 --> 04:52.180]  That...
[04:52.180 --> 04:52.580]  Oh!
[04:53.160 --> 04:53.700]  Balls.
[04:54.240 --> 04:54.520]  I'm sorry.
[04:54.640 --> 04:55.820]  I was distracted by Jugs McTugz.
[04:55.820 --> 04:58.600]  We had such good draft recordings this morning.
[04:58.700 --> 05:00.120]  Let's harness that positivity.
[05:01.700 --> 05:02.720]  We did great.
[05:04.820 --> 05:06.100]  That was doing good.
[05:06.180 --> 05:07.480]  That was getting back on the track.
[05:08.520 --> 05:09.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:09.720 --> 05:11.660]  Geoff just walked to his doom.
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.440]  Okay.
[05:12.460 --> 05:14.000]  No, you need to leave, Gavin.
[05:14.160 --> 05:15.180]  You need to get off my head.
[05:15.180 --> 05:15.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:15.480 --> 05:16.720]  But what if he doesn't do anything?
[05:18.480 --> 05:20.020]  I haven't been second for a while.
[05:20.300 --> 05:21.720]  Forgot about it.
[05:25.080 --> 05:25.800]  That was blue.
[05:33.210 --> 05:35.090]  Did someone else get the key that time?
[05:35.630 --> 05:36.030]  Yes.
[05:36.230 --> 05:37.930]  Someone else did manage to get the key.
[05:39.210 --> 05:39.510]  Okay.
[05:40.830 --> 05:41.230]  Perfect.
[05:41.410 --> 05:41.830]  Thank you.
[05:44.530 --> 05:45.210]  Oh, fuck.
[05:45.290 --> 05:45.530]  It's one.
[05:45.650 --> 05:45.910]  I forgot.
[05:46.490 --> 05:47.190]  Ah, shit.
[05:47.390 --> 05:48.590]  I fell and then...
[05:48.590 --> 05:48.870]  Shitbox.
[05:48.930 --> 05:49.310]  Sorry about that.
[05:49.990 --> 05:51.130]  That was the best run we've had.
[05:51.230 --> 05:51.710]  Yeah, that was good.
[05:51.990 --> 05:52.350]  Balls.
[05:52.350 --> 05:52.810]  Five gifted.
[05:52.930 --> 05:53.270]  Thank you.
[05:53.490 --> 05:54.330]  Nuts with balls.
[05:54.430 --> 05:55.830]  That was for you.
[06:02.030 --> 06:03.990]  Is this the one that breaks us?
[06:04.930 --> 06:05.510]  We'll do it.
[06:05.670 --> 06:06.110]  We got this.
[06:06.250 --> 06:08.410]  I mean, Nick might be the one to break me.
[06:08.570 --> 06:09.310]  Just stand in there.
[06:10.990 --> 06:11.490]  Oh, yeah.
[06:11.490 --> 06:12.650]  I'm going to be the one to break you.
[06:13.890 --> 06:14.710]  Plenty of time.
[06:14.930 --> 06:15.290]  Here we go.
[06:19.810 --> 06:21.210]  Yes, you did that.
[06:25.570 --> 06:26.790]  That was rough.
[06:28.430 --> 06:28.910]  Sorry.
[06:29.210 --> 06:29.590]  That was amazing.
[06:30.970 --> 06:31.710]  That was neat.
[06:31.730 --> 06:34.370]  All the time in the world.
[06:34.570 --> 06:35.570]  There is time.
[06:37.070 --> 06:37.550]  Don't...
[06:37.550 --> 06:39.630]  I thought I was at the bottom, but I wasn't.
[06:43.670 --> 06:44.610]  There we go.
[06:46.530 --> 06:48.050]  You gotta go.
[06:49.570 --> 06:52.230]  A little slow on the draw on that one, but that's okay.
[06:56.120 --> 06:56.820]  Let's go.
[07:03.030 --> 07:04.770]  What do we do at the other end?
[07:05.470 --> 07:07.230]  It just gets worse over there.
[07:14.160 --> 07:14.680]  Jump.
[07:14.820 --> 07:15.300]  Sorry.
[07:16.540 --> 07:16.720]  Gavin.
[07:17.140 --> 07:19.140]  What was in the air?
[07:21.400 --> 07:25.820]  Like, our problems aren't solved when we get to the next phase of this, right?
[07:26.060 --> 07:28.280]  There's only one more little phase.
[07:28.360 --> 07:29.040]  You just have to get there.
[07:29.060 --> 07:29.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:29.520 --> 07:29.720]  Okay.
[07:32.000 --> 07:32.400]  Gavin!
[07:34.320 --> 07:34.620]  Sorry.
[07:36.280 --> 07:37.620]  You're so lucky it's your birthday.
[07:38.260 --> 07:39.860]  Dude, I don't know if he is.
[07:41.240 --> 07:42.400]  I don't know that he is.
[07:42.500 --> 07:44.600]  I don't feel like he's very safe.
[07:44.960 --> 07:45.360]  Ah!
[07:46.000 --> 07:46.400]  What?
[07:49.340 --> 07:51.420]  Eric, you were up my ass on that one.
[07:51.640 --> 07:52.000]  I hate this.
[07:52.180 --> 07:52.940]  Yeah, I'm trying to win.
[07:53.220 --> 07:54.840]  Geoff, any thoughts about the key?
[07:55.680 --> 07:57.360]  Considering anything that we're doing here?
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.240]  I'm not used to being bottom.
[07:59.480 --> 07:59.900]  I do not accept that death.
[08:01.060 --> 08:03.880]  I'm typically a power top, so I don't really know what to tell you.
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.120]  Geoff!
[08:05.640 --> 08:06.080]  I moved.
[08:06.700 --> 08:06.960]  Try again.
[08:07.080 --> 08:07.300]  Nope.
[08:08.000 --> 08:08.840]  See, I'm over it.
[08:10.040 --> 08:11.540]  You can see me over there.
[08:13.860 --> 08:14.980]  I moved too far that time.
[08:17.040 --> 08:18.160]  How did I die?
[08:21.100 --> 08:21.900]  Oh, no!
[08:22.500 --> 08:23.780]  I just don't know.
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.540]  We know what to do at the beginning.
[08:26.640 --> 08:28.180]  You just have to look in the same spot.
[08:29.080 --> 08:29.820]  What's happening?
[08:29.960 --> 08:30.260]  There we go.
[08:31.700 --> 08:33.560]  I don't know, man.
[08:33.580 --> 08:34.540]  It's too much going, man.
[08:34.660 --> 08:35.720]  There's so much going to go.
[08:36.640 --> 08:37.460]  Too much gas.
[08:39.100 --> 08:40.040]  Not enough gas.
[08:40.520 --> 08:41.480]  Got the key, though.
[08:41.520 --> 08:42.280]  I got that key, though.
[08:42.280 --> 08:42.880]  It was in my hand.
[08:44.040 --> 08:44.680]  It's progress.
[08:46.100 --> 08:46.500]  Something.
[08:47.320 --> 08:47.500]  Okay.
[08:47.500 --> 08:52.180]  See, last time we did this, by the time we got to this, we were so lubed up.
[08:53.400 --> 08:54.440]  God damn it!
[08:54.820 --> 08:55.220]  Oof.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.520]  Thank you, Regulation Moon Girl.
[08:59.540 --> 09:00.780]  Regulation Moon Girl.
[09:01.440 --> 09:01.920]  Thank you.
[09:02.240 --> 09:03.080]  Can we have a moon fact?
[09:03.520 --> 09:04.100]  Ah, sorry.
[09:04.300 --> 09:04.860]  Sorry, just terrible.
[09:04.880 --> 09:06.600]  Yeah, I wouldn't pay anything for the moon.
[09:08.160 --> 09:10.540]  I asked Derek today if he would pay...
[09:11.220 --> 09:14.620]  If he would pay 50 bucks for a handful of moon gravel.
[09:14.620 --> 09:16.060]  You should just focus on one thing at a time, I think.
[09:16.460 --> 09:16.780]  Yeah.
[09:18.320 --> 09:18.640]  Yeah.
[09:23.710 --> 09:24.350]  Oh, shit.
[09:24.590 --> 09:25.330]  That was generous.
[09:27.610 --> 09:27.930]  Okay.
[09:28.630 --> 09:29.830]  Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[09:30.970 --> 09:31.830]  We gotta hit this button.
[09:32.550 --> 09:32.770]  Then what?
[09:32.830 --> 09:33.710]  Get off, get off, get off, get off!
[09:33.750 --> 09:34.550]  Go, go, go, go!
[09:34.610 --> 09:34.910]  Get in!
[09:35.310 --> 09:36.170]  Open, open, open!
[09:36.310 --> 09:37.030]  Get in the door!
[09:39.070 --> 09:40.030]  That's super easy.
[09:40.170 --> 09:41.070]  It's an easy complete.
[09:41.210 --> 09:42.550]  You just have to walk in.
[09:42.630 --> 09:44.150]  All you have to do is walk in.
[09:44.770 --> 09:45.930]  That's so fucking easy!
[09:45.970 --> 09:47.730]  All the time in the world!
[09:47.730 --> 09:49.390]  What took you guys so long?
[09:52.390 --> 09:54.590]  That's for Gavin's birthday. Simple shit.
[09:54.970 --> 09:55.330]  Thank you.
[09:55.610 --> 09:57.290]  This is the last docked park.
[09:57.850 --> 09:58.250]  Incredible.
[09:58.590 --> 10:00.110]  This is the day we beat it, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:00.270 --> 10:00.610]  This is it.
[10:00.650 --> 10:03.150]  Oh, thanks so much for the subscription there, PhoenixEdits.
[10:03.150 --> 10:03.850]  That's awesome of you.
[10:03.970 --> 10:04.790]  Thank you so much.
[10:04.870 --> 10:05.210]  Oh, thank you.
[10:05.410 --> 10:06.090]  Six months.
[10:06.230 --> 10:08.130]  Geoff forgot that he was playing the video game.
[10:08.290 --> 10:09.730]  I was thinking PhoenixEdits.
[10:10.690 --> 10:13.530]  It sounded like I said PhoenixEggs there.
[10:13.790 --> 10:14.290]  It did.
[10:14.650 --> 10:16.510]  It sounded a little bit like that, yeah.
[10:18.510 --> 10:18.910]  PhoenixEdits.
[10:18.910 --> 10:19.570]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[10:19.670 --> 10:20.330]  Don't hit it.
[10:20.490 --> 10:23.150]  What happens here with the drop?
[10:24.150 --> 10:25.650]  How are these things dropping?
[10:25.870 --> 10:26.710]  Should we stack?
[10:27.170 --> 10:27.870]  Yeah, this happens.
[10:29.450 --> 10:31.090]  So where are we supposed to go?
[10:31.630 --> 10:34.190]  Did it leave two slight holes that I saw?
[10:34.270 --> 10:34.770]  I don't know.
[10:34.850 --> 10:35.390]  I didn't see any.
[10:35.630 --> 10:36.150]  I didn't see any holes.
[10:36.150 --> 10:37.150]  Everyone get in the holes.
[10:37.350 --> 10:37.850]  Let's look.
[10:38.090 --> 10:39.150]  I think I saw one.
[10:39.390 --> 10:40.230]  No, there's no holes.
[10:40.230 --> 10:41.050]  There was no holes.
[10:41.350 --> 10:41.470]  No.
[10:44.070 --> 10:44.870]  What if...
[10:44.870 --> 10:45.610]  All right, hang on, hang on.
[10:45.610 --> 10:47.210]  Purple's going to go all the way to the front.
[10:47.330 --> 10:50.570]  What if we make a really high stack and it's as far back as we can get?
[10:50.950 --> 10:51.350]  Okay.
[10:51.730 --> 10:51.790]  Like here.
[10:52.650 --> 10:55.630]  Like distance-wise, like this.
[10:55.970 --> 10:58.250]  So it's like the furthest we can get away from him.
[10:58.710 --> 10:59.270]  Like that.
[10:59.710 --> 10:59.990]  No.
[11:01.590 --> 11:03.250]  I was hoping that maybe it was just...
[11:03.410 --> 11:04.890]  We stay really far away.
[11:05.310 --> 11:05.710]  Yeah.
[11:05.870 --> 11:06.690]  That's what we have to do.
[11:07.110 --> 11:08.310]  Do you think there's something to that?
[11:08.770 --> 11:08.990]  Yeah.
[11:09.090 --> 11:10.150]  Yeah, I think so.
[11:10.310 --> 11:10.510]  Okay.
[11:10.690 --> 11:11.910]  So it'll be purple again.
[11:12.870 --> 11:14.610]  So maybe we stay...
[11:14.610 --> 11:15.730]  So we'll just tease the...
[11:16.270 --> 11:17.550]  Blue, just run left.
[11:17.630 --> 11:18.350]  Blue, go left.
[11:20.450 --> 11:20.730]  Okay.
[11:21.670 --> 11:22.350]  So let's see.
[11:22.390 --> 11:22.830]  Go a little bit.
[11:22.930 --> 11:23.230]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:23.290 --> 11:23.770]  There you go.
[11:24.150 --> 11:24.870]  Keep inching, Nick.
[11:25.950 --> 11:27.110]  Yeah, keep doing what you guys are doing.
[11:27.730 --> 11:28.030]  That's it.
[11:28.030 --> 11:28.350]  That's it.
[11:28.430 --> 11:28.770]  It worked.
[11:28.910 --> 11:29.110]  That's it.
[11:29.290 --> 11:29.470]  Got it.
[11:29.730 --> 11:29.890]  Cool.
[11:30.010 --> 11:30.550]  Nailed it.
[11:30.690 --> 11:31.430]  Wow, that sucked.
[11:31.670 --> 11:31.890]  All right.
[11:32.010 --> 11:32.590]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11:32.790 --> 11:33.730]  Oh my God.
[11:35.370 --> 11:37.070]  I'm going to just stick my head out for a second.
[11:37.730 --> 11:39.970]  You want to try it, Nick, and just see how far out it takes you?
[11:40.110 --> 11:41.290]  You might as well just be the guinea pig.
[11:41.330 --> 11:42.410]  We know what to do for the first part.
[11:43.770 --> 11:44.730]  Okay, we got a gap.
[11:45.210 --> 11:45.690]  Stackable gap.
[11:46.250 --> 11:46.470]  Okay.
[11:46.670 --> 11:47.090]  Okay, uh...
[11:47.090 --> 11:48.150]  We got a jump problem.
[11:48.150 --> 11:49.770]  Andrew, why don't you go and get on top of Nick?
[11:49.830 --> 11:50.550]  Oh, do you think...
[11:50.550 --> 11:51.450]  Okay, that doesn't fly.
[11:51.810 --> 11:52.070]  All right.
[11:52.850 --> 11:55.030]  And then, yeah, go ahead and get on top of them.
[11:56.090 --> 11:56.370]  Geoff.
[12:00.010 --> 12:01.790]  Okay, so should I go hit the flag or no?
[12:02.930 --> 12:03.870]  Oh, is it golf hole?
[12:05.350 --> 12:06.070]  Should I walk?
[12:06.530 --> 12:07.390]  Geoff, go a little left.
[12:07.890 --> 12:08.550]  Like, line up.
[12:08.630 --> 12:09.110]  Yeah, there you go.
[12:09.150 --> 12:10.170]  Yeah, let's get to three.
[12:10.170 --> 12:10.970]  Yeah, why don't you go ahead, Nick.
[12:11.070 --> 12:11.630]  We'll see what happens.
[12:11.930 --> 12:12.450]  All right.
[12:13.330 --> 12:14.550]  Okay, so that's a checkpoint.
[12:15.090 --> 12:15.730]  So now...
[12:15.730 --> 12:16.570]  So we just line up there.
[12:16.730 --> 12:16.950]  Here's what's gonna happen.
[12:16.950 --> 12:17.470]  I'll do this.
[12:17.590 --> 12:19.270]  Nick, Nick, Nick, you're gonna go to the gap.
[12:20.050 --> 12:20.370]  But...
[12:20.910 --> 12:21.230]  But...
[12:21.230 --> 12:21.850]  Oh, gotta...
[12:22.570 --> 12:24.030]  Yeah, we're gonna have to jump.
[12:24.250 --> 12:25.450]  I'm just gonna keep jumping.
[12:25.690 --> 12:27.190]  Me, yeah, I think this is just what we...
[12:27.190 --> 12:28.070]  Oh, my God.
[12:28.430 --> 12:29.430]  What are we gonna do?
[12:29.490 --> 12:30.590]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12:30.650 --> 12:30.790]  Yeah.
[12:31.530 --> 12:32.610]  On go, we all jump.
[12:33.750 --> 12:34.390]  Try to sink it.
[12:34.870 --> 12:35.190]  Okay.
[12:35.690 --> 12:36.890]  Go, we gotta do this.
[12:36.930 --> 12:37.730]  We gotta try it a couple times.
[12:37.830 --> 12:38.570]  It might need to be staggered.
[12:41.070 --> 12:41.590]  Try it again.
[12:41.590 --> 12:42.070]  That could work.
[12:47.640 --> 12:48.720]  Am I early?
[12:48.980 --> 12:49.220]  Try again.
[12:54.350 --> 12:55.030]  That was good.
[12:55.170 --> 12:55.530]  That might be it.
[12:55.690 --> 12:56.370]  All right, all right.
[12:56.510 --> 13:00.410]  When it's on go this time, Gavin, you're gonna do it.
[13:00.550 --> 13:00.730]  Okay?
[13:00.830 --> 13:01.450]  We're just gonna try it.
[13:01.870 --> 13:02.070]  Okay.
[13:06.820 --> 13:07.220]  What?
[13:12.200 --> 13:13.540]  This game sucks.
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.680]  That is the funniest thing.
[13:18.000 --> 13:18.260]  Hit it.
[13:18.480 --> 13:19.560]  That's the funniest thing.
[13:19.620 --> 13:19.920]  Wow.
[13:19.920 --> 13:20.140]  Oh!
[13:22.440 --> 13:24.540]  So you're gonna have to run under it.
[13:24.760 --> 13:25.800]  Yeah, hang on, hang on.
[13:25.800 --> 13:26.280]  And then jump it.
[13:26.340 --> 13:27.980]  So everyone stack.
[13:28.080 --> 13:28.660]  So stack.
[13:28.760 --> 13:29.160]  Stack.
[13:29.320 --> 13:30.640]  Be next to that point.
[13:31.120 --> 13:31.440]  Yeah.
[13:31.680 --> 13:31.780]  Yeah.
[13:32.480 --> 13:33.080]  Get on Nick.
[13:33.140 --> 13:33.480]  Get on Nick.
[13:33.540 --> 13:33.900]  Get on Nick.
[13:34.460 --> 13:35.220]  There you go.
[13:35.420 --> 13:35.540]  Okay.
[13:35.960 --> 13:36.280]  Oh shit.
[13:37.400 --> 13:39.340]  God, it's so lucky it's your fucking birthday.
[13:41.040 --> 13:41.920]  Stand right here.
[13:42.260 --> 13:43.540]  So you're gonna be next to it.
[13:43.740 --> 13:43.960]  Okay.
[13:44.080 --> 13:44.980]  Then I'm gonna hit it.
[13:45.160 --> 13:45.860]  You're gonna go left.
[13:45.860 --> 13:46.360]  And then walk over.
[13:46.700 --> 13:48.820]  Yeah, but then you have to go right immediately after.
[13:48.820 --> 13:50.280]  Yeah, I got it.
[13:51.620 --> 13:52.220]  Oh, fuck.
[13:52.440 --> 13:53.160]  Oh, this is new.
[13:53.300 --> 13:53.740]  You have to move.
[13:53.900 --> 13:54.360]  It's not immediate.
[13:54.360 --> 13:57.900]  I think that after it drops, everyone needs to scatter.
[13:58.300 --> 13:58.580]  Okay.
[13:59.020 --> 13:59.500]  Sounds good.
[14:00.200 --> 14:01.080]  Everyone stack on Andrew.
[14:01.240 --> 14:02.580]  It's slower than you expect.
[14:02.800 --> 14:02.860]  Yeah.
[14:02.980 --> 14:03.740]  Everyone stack on Andrew.
[14:06.300 --> 14:07.400]  Andrew, you gotta get in the gap.
[14:07.920 --> 14:08.500]  Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[14:08.620 --> 14:08.780]  You're right.
[14:08.820 --> 14:09.060]  You're right.
[14:09.100 --> 14:09.460]  You're right.
[14:09.520 --> 14:09.680]  You're right.
[14:09.720 --> 14:09.920]  You're right.
[14:09.980 --> 14:10.140]  You're right.
[14:10.200 --> 14:10.660]  Okay, here we go.
[14:11.640 --> 14:12.500]  Okay, here we go.
[14:12.600 --> 14:12.800]  Go.
[14:13.100 --> 14:13.440]  Here we go.
[14:14.180 --> 14:16.060]  It's very slow on the second one.
[14:16.180 --> 14:16.580]  Yes!
[14:16.760 --> 14:17.200]  There you go.
[14:17.520 --> 14:17.960]  Oh!
[14:18.760 --> 14:19.360]  Nailed it.
[14:19.560 --> 14:20.360]  Like a bullet in the wall.
[14:20.360 --> 14:20.780]  Awesome!
[14:21.160 --> 14:22.100]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14:22.900 --> 14:23.140]  Oh, shit.
[14:24.680 --> 14:25.560]  Okay, now...
[14:25.560 --> 14:27.160]  Gavin, get on me.
[14:27.620 --> 14:28.600]  Nick, get on Gavin.
[14:30.640 --> 14:31.940]  Geoff, get on Nick.
[14:33.240 --> 14:36.160]  And you're gonna take the key across and hit the button.
[14:36.380 --> 14:37.460]  But before you hit the button...
[14:37.460 --> 14:38.440]  So go, go, Geoff.
[14:38.740 --> 14:39.100]  Nope.
[14:39.280 --> 14:39.740]  Okay, go.
[14:39.880 --> 14:40.060]  Nope.
[14:40.280 --> 14:40.540]  All right.
[14:41.360 --> 14:42.160]  Go, Andrew.
[14:43.480 --> 14:44.760]  Go over Geoff and...
[14:44.760 --> 14:45.460]  Don't hit the button.
[14:45.560 --> 14:46.620]  Just go over Geoff and open the door.
[14:47.800 --> 14:48.120]  Now...
[14:48.120 --> 14:48.340]  Okay.
[14:49.620 --> 14:50.340]  So, Nick...
[14:50.340 --> 14:51.380]  What do we do?
[14:51.920 --> 14:53.080]  I'm really worried that we're gonna hit the...
[14:53.080 --> 14:53.500]  Should we just see what the button does?
[14:53.900 --> 14:54.720]  Yeah, hit the button.
[14:55.260 --> 14:56.360]  Oh, can we cower under...
[14:56.360 --> 14:56.580]  Woo!
[14:57.300 --> 14:58.760]  Okay, so you gotta jump under it.
[14:59.060 --> 14:59.620]  Oh, sleepy.
[14:59.620 --> 15:01.840]  So one person is gonna have to jump under it.
[15:03.000 --> 15:03.840]  Oh, my God.
[15:04.040 --> 15:04.260]  Okay.
[15:04.480 --> 15:05.740]  All right, you guys do what you did last time.
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.140]  You did great.
[15:07.480 --> 15:09.460]  I'll be the person that jumps last for the last thing.
[15:09.480 --> 15:09.840]  I don't care.
[15:09.840 --> 15:11.080]  Just because I'm taking this part.
[15:11.160 --> 15:11.400]  Ready?
[15:11.820 --> 15:12.380]  Here we go.
[15:14.700 --> 15:15.020]  Oh!
[15:17.600 --> 15:17.920]  Hmm.
[15:21.700 --> 15:22.360]  We're doing great.
[15:22.400 --> 15:22.860]  We're doing great.
[15:23.000 --> 15:23.800]  Everyone just do the same thing.
[15:23.880 --> 15:24.720]  Do the same thing you did before.
[15:27.640 --> 15:28.400]  Stack up straight.
[15:28.720 --> 15:29.200]  There we go.
[15:29.300 --> 15:29.900]  Okay, here we go.
[15:32.600 --> 15:33.220]  Oh, nice.
[15:33.300 --> 15:33.620]  Good work.
[15:33.760 --> 15:34.020]  Don't jump!
[15:34.220 --> 15:34.720]  Oh, boy.
[15:34.760 --> 15:35.100]  That was close.
[15:36.460 --> 15:36.780]  Okay.
[15:38.460 --> 15:41.420]  So everyone's gonna go across one by one.
[15:41.580 --> 15:42.420]  Don't hit the button.
[15:42.500 --> 15:43.600]  Just go ahead and open the door.
[15:45.380 --> 15:47.040]  Everyone go across and open the door.
[15:47.800 --> 15:48.380]  Can I make that jump?
[15:50.020 --> 15:50.340]  What?
[15:51.440 --> 15:51.840]  Oh, I need...
[15:51.840 --> 15:52.240]  It might be far.
[15:52.240 --> 15:53.100]  Do I need to be closer?
[15:53.880 --> 15:54.800]  I think you just have to jump.
[15:55.340 --> 15:57.200]  I might be able to get a hair closer.
[15:59.180 --> 16:00.740]  Eric, you died when you got a hair closer.
[16:00.840 --> 16:03.000]  No, I think I can get closer without doing that.
[16:03.160 --> 16:04.200]  I need to see how close I can get.
[16:04.440 --> 16:04.460]  Okay.
[16:04.960 --> 16:05.900]  I can jump better.
[16:05.900 --> 16:06.420]  Okay, ready?
[16:06.480 --> 16:07.000]  Here we go.
[16:09.560 --> 16:09.940]  Nice.
[16:10.100 --> 16:10.780]  Alright, get down, get down.
[16:10.980 --> 16:11.100]  Okay.
[16:13.820 --> 16:14.200]  Okay.
[16:14.860 --> 16:16.340]  Alright, everyone across.
[16:18.300 --> 16:19.080]  There you go.
[16:19.200 --> 16:19.880]  Yeah, everyone across.
[16:20.140 --> 16:20.420]  It can be done.
[16:21.500 --> 16:22.380]  Just don't hit the button.
[16:22.700 --> 16:23.440]  Just don't hit the button.
[16:25.240 --> 16:26.120]  Person with the key.
[16:26.920 --> 16:27.680]  That would be Nick.
[16:27.960 --> 16:28.660]  There you go.
[16:29.260 --> 16:30.600]  Okay, I need one person.
[16:30.740 --> 16:30.920]  Ready?
[16:32.260 --> 16:33.160]  Alright, hang on, Gavin.
[16:33.220 --> 16:33.900]  Hang on.
[16:34.060 --> 16:34.640]  On go.
[16:34.640 --> 16:35.180]  Ready?
[16:36.020 --> 16:36.160]  Yep.
[16:38.860 --> 16:39.580]  Oh, God!
[16:39.600 --> 16:40.560]  Okay, so it's like instant.
[16:40.960 --> 16:42.480]  Dude, I hit that button.
[16:42.660 --> 16:43.440]  Oh, my God.
[16:43.580 --> 16:45.780]  Dude, I wonder if it's a jump into it situation.
[16:45.800 --> 16:47.940]  I bet I could watch you jump and hit it.
[16:47.940 --> 16:48.120]  Yeah.
[16:48.120 --> 16:48.780]  It's so fast.
[16:48.880 --> 16:49.560]  I think that'll be it.
[16:50.600 --> 16:51.660]  Get off of me.
[16:51.720 --> 16:52.360]  Who's going forward?
[16:52.560 --> 16:52.740]  Okay.
[16:54.100 --> 16:54.820]  Just get on me.
[16:56.300 --> 16:56.900]  Alright, I'll get on you.
[16:56.900 --> 16:57.200]  Okay.
[16:58.860 --> 16:59.600]  Okay, you guys ready?
[17:00.140 --> 17:00.440]  Mm-hmm.
[17:00.500 --> 17:00.680]  Yep.
[17:00.860 --> 17:02.800]  A bit of a pissy stack, but alright.
[17:04.360 --> 17:04.700]  Hmm.
[17:05.360 --> 17:06.200]  How did I die?
[17:06.980 --> 17:08.300]  Oh, you were not lined up well.
[17:09.240 --> 17:09.580]  Yeah.
[17:09.780 --> 17:10.900]  You gotta listen to Geoff on that one.
[17:12.320 --> 17:12.480]  Hmm.
[17:12.700 --> 17:14.320]  Didn't look like it on my screen, I'll tell you that.
[17:20.220 --> 17:20.900]  Okay, you guys ready?
[17:21.320 --> 17:21.600]  Oh, yeah.
[17:21.640 --> 17:21.820]  Here we go.
[17:21.960 --> 17:22.420]  What stack?
[17:24.960 --> 17:25.300]  Nice.
[17:26.200 --> 17:26.940]  Way to go, boys.
[17:27.080 --> 17:27.720]  Good work.
[17:30.220 --> 17:30.560]  Okay.
[17:32.300 --> 17:33.440]  God fucking damn it.
[17:33.700 --> 17:36.340]  I'm trying to get as close as I physically can without touching it.
[17:36.340 --> 17:36.880]  I'm really sorry.
[17:36.880 --> 17:37.300]  Yeah, totally.
[17:37.420 --> 17:38.100]  No, it's all good.
[17:38.160 --> 17:38.460]  It's alright.
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.900]  Yeah, it's super good.
[17:42.040 --> 17:42.980]  Got this figured out.
[17:43.200 --> 17:43.520]  Okay.
[17:44.340 --> 17:44.660]  Okay.
[17:45.760 --> 17:47.280]  Interesting decision that was made here.
[17:49.220 --> 17:49.940]  Okay, you guys ready?
[17:50.240 --> 17:50.440]  Ready.
[17:50.560 --> 17:50.720]  Yeah.
[17:51.220 --> 17:52.080]  Oh, you guys need to stack up.
[17:52.140 --> 17:52.380]  There you go.
[17:52.400 --> 17:52.820]  Okay, here we go.
[17:55.360 --> 17:55.680]  Nice.
[17:55.780 --> 17:56.320]  Good work, boys.
[17:57.120 --> 17:58.600]  Oh my god, Gavin.
[17:59.200 --> 17:59.900]  Couldn't get down.
[18:00.020 --> 18:01.220]  I was running at the same speed.
[18:01.320 --> 18:02.260]  Yeah, it can be tricky.
[18:03.100 --> 18:03.420]  Okay.
[18:03.520 --> 18:05.120]  Alright, that might be as close as I can get.
[18:05.440 --> 18:06.120]  Alright, there you go.
[18:06.280 --> 18:07.000]  Yeah, tons of room.
[18:08.480 --> 18:09.160]  There you go.
[18:11.400 --> 18:12.320]  Alright, Gavin, you ready?
[18:13.120 --> 18:13.300]  Yeah.
[18:13.460 --> 18:15.780]  I'm going to count it down again, but I don't know that it's going to matter.
[18:15.900 --> 18:17.680]  I'm just going to jump when it's go.
[18:19.580 --> 18:20.540]  Oh, god damn it.
[18:20.600 --> 18:21.920]  You jumped pretty early there.
[18:21.920 --> 18:22.540]  Yeah, I jumped early.
[18:22.580 --> 18:23.180]  I jumped really early.
[18:23.260 --> 18:23.540]  I'm sorry.
[18:23.660 --> 18:24.240]  I got gun shy.
[18:25.100 --> 18:25.560]  That's alright.
[18:26.120 --> 18:27.220]  I said that earlier last time.
[18:27.760 --> 18:28.080]  Fuck.
[18:30.820 --> 18:31.140]  Okay.
[18:35.120 --> 18:36.080]  Alright, here we go.
[18:37.160 --> 18:37.460]  Uh-oh.
[18:37.880 --> 18:38.500]  Uh-oh.
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.340]  Geoff, any thoughts on that?
[18:43.120 --> 18:46.720]  Yeah, we didn't maintain the integrity of the stack, I think.
[18:47.360 --> 18:49.000]  I can't believe you guys all did that.
[18:49.060 --> 18:50.480]  Honestly, I can't believe Nintendo did that.
[18:50.860 --> 18:52.620]  Stack integrity was like 20% there.
[18:52.740 --> 18:53.380]  Alright, here we go.
[18:53.740 --> 18:55.020]  Nintendo did do that that time, though.
[18:56.180 --> 18:56.860]  Nice, good work.
[18:57.000 --> 18:57.260]  Gavin!
[19:07.840 --> 19:08.200]  Splash.
[19:08.520 --> 19:08.820]  Splash.
[19:09.120 --> 19:10.120]  I can't hear.
[19:11.180 --> 19:11.900]  Fuck me.
[19:13.480 --> 19:15.620]  I gotta stop trying to get as close as I can get.
[19:17.260 --> 19:17.800]  Okay, you ready?
[19:18.100 --> 19:19.140]  Smacking all that shit around.
[19:19.420 --> 19:19.860]  Okay, here we go.
[19:19.900 --> 19:20.580]  That was me that time.
[19:22.480 --> 19:23.200]  Good work!
[19:23.740 --> 19:24.520]  Way to go, guys.
[19:24.620 --> 19:24.940]  Way to go.
[19:27.580 --> 19:30.740]  I think that's it.
[19:30.860 --> 19:31.840]  I think that's as close as I can get.
[19:32.180 --> 19:32.720]  I think that's as close.
[19:32.980 --> 19:33.320]  Sorry.
[19:33.760 --> 19:34.940]  It's easier to clear than...
[19:35.640 --> 19:37.000]  I moved on my screen.
[19:37.000 --> 19:37.540]  Oh boy, guys.
[19:38.260 --> 19:39.140]  Okay, okay.
[19:39.780 --> 19:41.240]  Alright, let's try it again, Gavin.
[19:41.260 --> 19:41.580]  You ready?
[19:42.120 --> 19:42.960]  Here we go.
[19:47.380 --> 19:49.640]  Now I will say, you were a hair early.
[19:51.340 --> 19:52.380]  You're doing great.
[19:52.700 --> 19:53.520]  You're doing great.
[19:53.860 --> 19:54.720]  Happy birthday.
[19:55.220 --> 19:56.700]  You were just a hair early.
[19:57.680 --> 19:59.340]  Look, I'm not the one for the button.
[19:59.620 --> 19:59.920]  I'm trying.
[20:00.100 --> 20:00.640]  Okay, okay.
[20:00.720 --> 20:01.680]  Somebody else can do the button.
[20:01.820 --> 20:02.800]  I don't care who does the button.
[20:03.140 --> 20:03.520]  It's fine.
[20:03.980 --> 20:05.080]  I keep going off too soon.
[20:05.080 --> 20:06.520]  Okay, here we go.
[20:06.660 --> 20:07.860]  That'll happen sometimes.
[20:09.440 --> 20:09.840]  Oops.
[20:11.340 --> 20:13.320]  We kind of didn't decide on a direction.
[20:14.940 --> 20:16.120]  Have we ever gone left?
[20:16.440 --> 20:19.040]  I decided to go left because people were getting caught up.
[20:19.120 --> 20:21.040]  And we're all going in the same way so far.
[20:26.140 --> 20:26.540]  Okay.
[20:28.620 --> 20:29.320]  Andrew, you ready?
[20:29.900 --> 20:30.300]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[20:30.700 --> 20:32.000]  I'm gonna poo today.
[20:33.880 --> 20:34.800]  Sorry, that was me.
[20:34.860 --> 20:35.980]  I jumped the gun a little bit.
[20:42.170 --> 20:43.810]  I don't mind being the bottom every time.
[20:45.290 --> 20:47.310]  Oh, Geoff, that was perfect what we just did there.
[20:47.410 --> 20:48.130]  Yeah, it was beautiful.
[20:49.210 --> 20:49.850]  That's synchronicity.
[20:51.430 --> 20:52.090]  Okay, you guys ready?
[20:52.510 --> 20:52.950]  Here we go.
[20:56.960 --> 20:57.620]  Nice, good work.
[20:57.780 --> 20:58.060]  Perfect.
[21:03.080 --> 21:03.740]  Okay, that's it.
[21:03.940 --> 21:04.240]  There you go.
[21:05.300 --> 21:05.740]  Yeah!
[21:05.920 --> 21:07.500]  Alright, who's gonna be the button presser this time?
[21:08.540 --> 21:09.260]  I can press it.
[21:09.360 --> 21:09.660]  Okay.
[21:13.280 --> 21:13.720]  Okay.
[21:14.980 --> 21:16.040]  Alright, here we go.
[21:16.240 --> 21:16.540]  You ready?
[21:17.220 --> 21:17.360]  Yep.
[21:17.780 --> 21:18.120]  On go.
[21:21.260 --> 21:23.400]  Oh my god, that's on me.
[21:23.560 --> 21:24.460]  That's so on me.
[21:28.460 --> 21:28.900]  Fuck.
[21:29.220 --> 21:29.700]  It's tricky.
[21:29.800 --> 21:30.400]  God damn it.
[21:30.820 --> 21:31.920]  It's so fast.
[21:32.040 --> 21:33.460]  It's so fucking fast.
[21:33.800 --> 21:34.200]  Alright.
[21:35.940 --> 21:36.380]  Ah.
[21:37.940 --> 21:39.080]  Alright, you guys ready?
[21:39.480 --> 21:39.740]  Ready.
[21:44.460 --> 21:44.900]  What?
[21:45.200 --> 21:46.460]  How did Eric die?
[21:46.680 --> 21:47.040]  How did I die?
[21:47.040 --> 21:47.800]  Did you fall to the ground?
[21:49.340 --> 21:50.740]  Does anyone know how I died?
[21:51.320 --> 21:51.520]  No.
[21:51.740 --> 21:51.880]  What happened?
[21:51.880 --> 21:52.640]  Did you commit suicide?
[21:53.340 --> 21:54.140]  What happened?
[21:55.260 --> 21:56.700]  Is there a suicide button in this?
[21:57.420 --> 21:58.180]  What happened?
[21:58.460 --> 21:58.760]  Okay.
[21:58.900 --> 22:00.480]  Did you slap me on the desk and commit suicide?
[22:00.480 --> 22:01.300]  No, I didn't do it.
[22:01.320 --> 22:02.120]  I was watching it.
[22:02.200 --> 22:03.140]  All of a sudden I was dead.
[22:03.500 --> 22:04.780]  Alright, here we go.
[22:04.800 --> 22:05.040]  What?
[22:05.040 --> 22:06.380]  Here we go.
[22:11.240 --> 22:12.000]  There we go.
[22:14.640 --> 22:15.120]  Well.
[22:16.320 --> 22:17.380]  Is that close enough?
[22:18.060 --> 22:18.320]  Yeah.
[22:18.460 --> 22:18.660]  Okay.
[22:21.980 --> 22:22.460]  Oh.
[22:22.940 --> 22:23.440]  You jump over.
[22:26.680 --> 22:27.160]  Bye.
[22:28.360 --> 22:28.660]  Bye.
[22:31.640 --> 22:32.400]  Alright, Andrew.
[22:32.440 --> 22:33.040]  We got it this time.
[22:33.080 --> 22:33.340]  Here we go.
[22:33.340 --> 22:34.820]  Here we go.
[22:38.060 --> 22:38.500]  Yes!
[22:38.540 --> 22:38.960]  Yes!
[22:41.420 --> 22:43.400]  I was scared I was going to come back.
[22:43.820 --> 22:46.380]  I didn't even think about that.
[22:47.500 --> 22:48.600]  Well done, John.
[22:48.820 --> 22:49.620]  One done.
[22:50.400 --> 22:51.920]  Thank you guys for watching.
[22:52.020 --> 22:53.660]  What a Friday stream for Gavin's birthday.
[22:53.740 --> 22:54.780]  All the way to 501.
[22:54.800 --> 22:55.700]  It's hot in here, baby.
[22:55.740 --> 22:57.000]  It's the last dark park.
[22:57.140 --> 22:57.800]  Let's do it.
[22:59.320 --> 23:00.200]  Samuel O'Stachey.
[23:01.960 --> 23:03.440]  Alright, everyone hold right.
[23:03.600 --> 23:04.460]  Everyone just hold right.
[23:04.560 --> 23:05.080]  Keep holding right.
[23:05.080 --> 23:06.080]  Hold right.
[23:08.180 --> 23:08.620]  Hold right.
[23:10.640 --> 23:11.080]  Sorry.
[23:14.200 --> 23:15.080]  Hold and right.
[23:15.940 --> 23:16.580]  Everyone hold right.
[23:16.980 --> 23:17.780]  Hold and right.
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.080]  Alright, so that was Gavin.
[23:19.520 --> 23:19.560]  Okay.
[23:20.460 --> 23:21.340]  Happy birthday.
[23:21.820 --> 23:21.980]  Well.
[23:22.140 --> 23:22.480]  Boy.
[23:22.820 --> 23:23.200]  So.
[23:23.520 --> 23:24.500]  Lucky it's your birthday.
[23:25.440 --> 23:26.700]  Well, that wasn't the cause of death.
[23:26.700 --> 23:27.180]  Hold right!
[23:27.600 --> 23:28.740]  No, I think it was.
[23:28.820 --> 23:29.580]  Yeah, it kind of was.
[23:30.340 --> 23:31.340]  Someone missed the jump.
[23:31.440 --> 23:31.820]  That was me.
[23:32.860 --> 23:34.280]  Because we were all too buzzed up.
[23:34.280 --> 23:35.080]  Hold.
[23:35.080 --> 23:35.220]  Yeah.
[23:35.680 --> 23:35.820]  Right.
[23:36.120 --> 23:36.740]  Hold right.
[23:36.740 --> 23:37.660]  Hold right right now.
[23:38.000 --> 23:38.780]  Hold right right now.
[23:39.120 --> 23:39.560]  Goddamn.
[23:44.650 --> 23:45.410]  Leap of faith.
[23:45.770 --> 23:45.910]  Oh.
[23:46.330 --> 23:46.570]  Ah!
[23:47.410 --> 23:49.470]  Okay, so follow the line directly down.
[23:49.490 --> 23:50.110]  Follow the line down.
[23:50.630 --> 23:50.850]  Yeah.
[23:50.970 --> 23:51.650]  What the fuck?
[23:52.270 --> 23:52.510]  Ah!
[23:52.810 --> 23:53.410]  Hold right.
[24:00.740 --> 24:01.880]  What about the thing, though?
[24:02.120 --> 24:02.640]  It's coming!
[24:02.640 --> 24:03.100]  It's coming!
[24:03.400 --> 24:04.160]  Oh, boy.
[24:04.620 --> 24:06.040]  We have to make a stack.
[24:06.740 --> 24:06.860]  Yeah.
[24:06.860 --> 24:08.280]  We're going to have to stack and move right.
[24:08.360 --> 24:09.080]  And the person on the top.
[24:09.100 --> 24:09.420]  Hold right.
[24:13.350 --> 24:14.570]  This is going to be easy.
[24:14.810 --> 24:15.790]  Okay, we got this.
[24:15.890 --> 24:16.110]  We got this.
[24:16.110 --> 24:16.550]  Alright, I'll stack at the bottom.
[24:18.550 --> 24:18.890]  Right.
[24:19.450 --> 24:20.530]  Oh, Gavin.
[24:20.650 --> 24:21.690]  I didn't know there was nothing I could do.
[24:22.270 --> 24:22.550]  Yeah, Gavin did nothing.
[24:22.730 --> 24:23.950]  So lucky it's your birthday!
[24:25.830 --> 24:26.510]  Hold right!
[24:26.970 --> 24:27.310]  Right!
[24:27.370 --> 24:27.730]  Yeah, sorry.
[24:27.790 --> 24:28.090]  That was me.
[24:28.230 --> 24:28.470]  That was me.
[24:28.590 --> 24:28.850]  That was me.
[24:29.010 --> 24:30.110]  No, it's also Gavin.
[24:30.270 --> 24:30.770]  Gavin did nothing.
[24:31.050 --> 24:31.190]  Happy birthday!
[24:31.550 --> 24:32.090]  Aw, yeah.
[24:39.150 --> 24:40.170]  Alright, stack them up!
[24:41.590 --> 24:41.810]  Oh.
[24:42.890 --> 24:43.230]  Oh.
[24:43.230 --> 24:44.010]  Go, Dickhead.
[24:44.170 --> 24:44.310]  Jump, jump, jump!
[24:44.310 --> 24:44.830]  Should I go to the top?
[24:45.250 --> 24:45.390]  Go!
[24:45.710 --> 24:46.870]  Oh, my God!
[24:47.050 --> 24:48.770]  We need height to...
[24:48.770 --> 24:49.170]  Gavin!
[24:49.350 --> 24:52.230]  Like, I just don't like...
[24:53.530 --> 24:55.570]  Well, because when I jumped it would go down, so I was like...
[24:55.830 --> 24:58.370]  I was like, should I jump or should I stay still on the platform?
[24:58.630 --> 24:59.830]  Do you think staying still helped?
[25:00.630 --> 25:02.470]  Well, I didn't know if a four-step could make it...
[25:02.470 --> 25:03.410]  ...or it has to be five.
[25:03.610 --> 25:04.650]  We lost!
[25:07.810 --> 25:11.390]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[25:11.410 --> 25:12.450]  Go, go, go, go!
[25:12.450 --> 25:12.970]  Get on me!
[25:13.250 --> 25:13.930]  Brad, what are you doing?
[25:14.210 --> 25:15.470]  See, Andrew's doing to me now.
[25:15.790 --> 25:15.990]  Yep.
[25:17.970 --> 25:18.710]  Now come back to us!
[25:18.790 --> 25:19.330]  Now come back to us!
[25:19.470 --> 25:20.290]  Bye-bye.
[25:20.550 --> 25:20.790]  Alright.
[25:22.970 --> 25:23.450]  Straighten up, straighten up.
[25:23.450 --> 25:24.530]  We can walk off from the...
[25:24.530 --> 25:24.770]  Hang on.
[25:24.850 --> 25:26.370]  It'll have to be me walking off, right?
[25:26.470 --> 25:27.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:28.950 --> 25:29.910]  Okay, go ahead, Eric.
[25:30.470 --> 25:31.590]  Okay, we'll wait here.
[25:32.730 --> 25:33.450]  A slug!
[25:33.510 --> 25:34.110]  A slimy goo!
[25:34.630 --> 25:34.970]  Gavin!
[25:35.410 --> 25:35.750]  Come on!
[25:36.090 --> 25:36.710]  Get up there!
[25:38.070 --> 25:38.430]  Jump!
[25:38.650 --> 25:40.330]  Jump on him, and then you're gonna have to jump it!
[25:41.070 --> 25:41.590]  There you go.
[25:41.590 --> 25:41.870]  Yes!
[25:42.050 --> 25:42.830]  Good job!
[25:43.850 --> 25:44.690]  Alright, let's go.
[25:45.390 --> 25:45.950]  Go!
[25:46.170 --> 25:46.690]  Go!
[25:48.590 --> 25:50.630]  We had to wait a second, Eric!
[25:53.150 --> 25:53.890]  Get in!
[25:55.690 --> 25:56.250]  Wow!
[25:57.330 --> 25:57.830]  Terrible!
[25:58.130 --> 25:59.270]  He's doing to me!
[25:59.950 --> 26:00.210]  Terrible!
[26:01.430 --> 26:02.870]  On the run of a lifetime!
[26:04.410 --> 26:05.810]  Right, and he got it to work!
[26:07.250 --> 26:08.090]  Happy birthday.
[26:12.870 --> 26:13.630]  Oh my god.
[26:15.590 --> 26:16.390]  Oh, are we sliding?
[26:17.530 --> 26:17.990]  Is this sliding?
[26:18.070 --> 26:18.770]  Don't press.
[26:19.390 --> 26:19.850]  Oh my god.
[26:19.850 --> 26:20.750]  No, it's like pushing us back.
[26:20.770 --> 26:24.410]  Okay, I just wanted to confirm that it was actually a don't press.
[26:25.690 --> 26:26.250]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:27.510 --> 26:28.290]  Like the troll.
[26:28.290 --> 26:29.150]  We are drifting a little.
[26:29.150 --> 26:29.870]  Okay, hang on, hang on.
[26:29.910 --> 26:30.070]  Wait.
[26:30.330 --> 26:30.850]  Oh boy.
[26:31.150 --> 26:31.610]  Oh boy.
[26:31.850 --> 26:32.510]  Oh, it's a fan.
[26:32.710 --> 26:33.210]  We got a fan.
[26:34.470 --> 26:36.650]  There was another don't press after the fan.
[26:36.970 --> 26:38.070]  There's another one over there.
[26:43.450 --> 26:43.850]  Woohoo!
[26:48.940 --> 26:50.620]  On my screen, you pressed it?
[26:50.700 --> 26:51.280]  Oh boy.
[26:53.480 --> 26:54.360]  And another one.
[26:55.380 --> 26:56.500]  And another one.
[26:56.800 --> 26:57.220]  Oh boy.
[26:57.580 --> 26:58.180]  And another one.
[26:58.660 --> 26:59.320]  We got a tower.
[26:59.680 --> 27:00.840]  We're going to have to stack.
[27:02.280 --> 27:03.340]  Oh, it's going to be controlled by this.
[27:03.340 --> 27:04.060]  You don't have to...
[27:04.060 --> 27:04.720]  Oh my god.
[27:04.720 --> 27:08.860]  Hey guys, if you're on top of someone's head, you don't need to move, I don't think?
[27:08.900 --> 27:09.860]  Or do you, because of the fan?
[27:09.900 --> 27:10.320]  I'm not sure.
[27:10.400 --> 27:11.080]  The fan blows you.
[27:11.860 --> 27:12.400]  I'm not sure.
[27:12.400 --> 27:13.760]  Well, here, let's find out.
[27:13.800 --> 27:14.220]  Wait, wait, wait.
[27:14.360 --> 27:14.980]  Let's find out right here.
[27:15.100 --> 27:15.700]  Let's find out.
[27:15.820 --> 27:16.480]  It does blow you.
[27:16.660 --> 27:17.360]  It does blow.
[27:17.620 --> 27:18.940]  But at what height does it not?
[27:19.400 --> 27:19.800]  Keep stacking.
[27:19.800 --> 27:20.480]  Let's find out.
[27:21.280 --> 27:21.400]  Yeah.
[27:21.740 --> 27:22.040]  Third.
[27:22.220 --> 27:23.720]  I am not moving.
[27:23.760 --> 27:24.340]  So, third up.
[27:24.380 --> 27:28.540]  So, bottom two have to keep it even.
[27:28.760 --> 27:30.420]  First two, yeah, they got to be busy.
[27:34.920 --> 27:36.620]  Did that flicker on anyone else's screen?
[27:36.620 --> 27:36.980]  Yes, absolutely.
[27:37.920 --> 27:38.580]  Yeah, like that.
[27:42.400 --> 27:43.800]  That was so funny.
[27:45.260 --> 27:47.920]  It was so, you did it so technically.
[27:48.600 --> 27:49.180]  I just swatted you down with the palm of my hand.
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.380]  Wait, yeah, we did bunch up.
[27:56.580 --> 27:57.620]  A little bit of a bunch.
[27:58.420 --> 27:58.900]  Gavin.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.060]  A little bit of a bunch.
[28:01.180 --> 28:01.420]  It's a rush.
[28:02.080 --> 28:03.160]  Gotta be kidding me.
[28:03.400 --> 28:03.980]  God damn.
[28:04.680 --> 28:05.360]  That's crazy.
[28:05.680 --> 28:06.520]  This is even hard.
[28:06.740 --> 28:07.980]  This is even the hard part.
[28:09.420 --> 28:10.680]  This part is the easy part.
[28:10.840 --> 28:12.000]  This is the easy part.
[28:16.620 --> 28:19.980]  We've already accomplished so much today though.
[28:20.460 --> 28:21.080]  Maybe it'd be better.
[28:22.560 --> 28:22.960]  What?
[28:23.140 --> 28:23.320]  Okay.
[28:25.100 --> 28:25.500]  Okay.
[28:25.800 --> 28:28.420]  Remember when Eric just had a heart attack and died at that other level?
[28:29.120 --> 28:29.960]  That was crazy.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.500]  That's how it's really going to happen too.
[28:32.960 --> 28:33.160]  Yeah.
[28:36.120 --> 28:38.400]  Do you think it'll be at home or like in the office?
[28:38.700 --> 28:39.320]  No, it'll be at home.
[28:40.840 --> 28:41.840]  Oh my God.
[28:42.040 --> 28:42.200]  Yeah.
[28:42.620 --> 28:44.000]  I feel like I should start checking in.
[28:44.460 --> 28:47.220]  I'm going to go out like Gigi and the Sopranos on the toilet.
[28:48.000 --> 28:48.380]  Sorry.
[28:49.120 --> 28:50.340]  Text your small wife every day.
[28:50.340 --> 28:50.920]  It's easy to do.
[28:54.440 --> 28:54.820]  Fireplace7423.
[28:55.020 --> 28:55.620]  Thanks for the $5.50.
[28:55.620 --> 28:56.180]  Yeah, see that, baby.
[28:56.260 --> 28:56.660]  Happy birthday, Gavin.
[28:56.660 --> 28:57.380]  Thank you so much.
[28:58.820 --> 28:59.580]  Happy fireplace.
[29:00.860 --> 29:03.460]  Oh, we were on a tear right there at the beginning, boys.
[29:03.560 --> 29:04.460]  That was pretty impressive.
[29:05.940 --> 29:06.620]  There we go.
[29:06.840 --> 29:07.340]  There we go.
[29:08.320 --> 29:08.880]  There we go.
[29:09.660 --> 29:10.360]  There we go.
[29:11.060 --> 29:12.140]  All right, start stacking.
[29:12.380 --> 29:13.180]  Remember, it's just you two.
[29:14.900 --> 29:15.300]  Gavin!
[29:15.800 --> 29:16.200]  Gavin!
[29:16.460 --> 29:16.640]  What?
[29:16.920 --> 29:17.060]  What?
[29:18.540 --> 29:19.940]  Why'd you fall off of me, Gavin?
[29:20.200 --> 29:22.640]  Well, I fell off and I thought you would jump on because you were behind.
[29:23.220 --> 29:24.320]  No, because Geoff was on me.
[29:24.620 --> 29:24.920]  Okay.
[29:25.860 --> 29:26.220]  I'll jump back on.
[29:26.220 --> 29:31.900]  We had a chat just asked if Twitch comment counts as making you a comment lever.
[29:32.180 --> 29:34.180]  And then they said, I feel like it's a gray area.
[29:34.460 --> 29:36.600]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[29:36.620 --> 29:38.080]  There's nothing gray about that area.
[29:38.380 --> 29:39.140]  In what way?
[29:39.140 --> 29:41.560]  Hey, buddy, it's black and white.
[29:42.060 --> 29:43.580]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[29:43.820 --> 29:46.860]  The dictionary definition of a comment is that comment.
[29:47.160 --> 29:47.480]  Yeah.
[29:48.500 --> 29:49.500]  Did you do a comment?
[29:49.740 --> 29:50.560]  Did you leave it?
[29:50.920 --> 29:51.100]  Yeah.
[29:52.200 --> 29:56.520]  I met a guy named Gary in a coffee shop and he went, oh, this makes me a comment lever, huh?
[29:56.520 --> 29:57.300]  And I went, absolutely.
[29:57.620 --> 29:58.660]  You're an in-person comment lever.
[29:58.960 --> 29:59.220]  Yeah.
[30:00.820 --> 30:01.880]  That's the way it goes, man.
[30:02.020 --> 30:02.780]  Nothing wrong with it.
[30:02.820 --> 30:03.340]  Be a comment lever.
[30:03.340 --> 30:04.540]  Oh my God, man.
[30:05.180 --> 30:05.740]  Leave a comment.
[30:05.980 --> 30:06.220]  It's fine.
[30:06.380 --> 30:07.620]  I got so close to that button.
[30:08.040 --> 30:08.740]  You did, dude.
[30:08.740 --> 30:10.000]  You see that?
[30:10.140 --> 30:10.680]  You tickled it.
[30:10.820 --> 30:10.920]  Yeah.
[30:13.640 --> 30:14.280]  All right.
[30:14.940 --> 30:16.500]  Safari Green Lead Me Expedition.
[30:16.560 --> 30:17.560]  A lot of people press the button that says not to press.
[30:18.360 --> 30:19.000]  I've noticed.
[30:20.060 --> 30:20.900]  It's a good observation.
[30:21.160 --> 30:22.680]  It's not a comment, it's a chat.
[30:22.860 --> 30:24.240]  It's a comment in a chat.
[30:24.660 --> 30:25.480]  Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
[30:25.540 --> 30:26.680]  You're leaving a comment.
[30:27.020 --> 30:27.700]  I don't know what to tell you.
[30:27.700 --> 30:29.720]  When you're chatting, you are doing comments.
[30:29.740 --> 30:31.980]  When you're chatting, you're commenting on the thing that you're seeing.
[30:32.060 --> 30:33.140]  Yeah, I don't know what a commentary...
[30:33.140 --> 30:34.020]  It's a series of comments.
[30:34.260 --> 30:34.900]  Yeah, I don't know what...
[30:34.900 --> 30:35.320]  It's a commentary.
[30:35.540 --> 30:36.640]  I don't know what you're talking about, dude.
[30:38.980 --> 30:39.860]  Oh my God.
[30:39.860 --> 30:43.880]  Also, we're the official arbiters of what does and doesn't constitute...
[30:43.880 --> 30:44.240]  Yes.
[30:44.440 --> 30:44.740]  ...commentary.
[30:44.740 --> 30:45.220]  And arguing.
[30:45.580 --> 30:47.060]  We've landed more squarely on that button.
[30:47.260 --> 30:48.240]  Yeah, I thought the same thing.
[30:49.500 --> 30:53.180]  That you landed as squarely on that button as that guy's chat comment...
[30:53.760 --> 30:54.800]  ...landed as a...
[30:54.800 --> 30:55.300]  ...landed in the chat.
[30:55.600 --> 30:56.420]  It's absolutely true.
[30:56.820 --> 30:57.620]  Just like Geoff there.
[30:58.140 --> 30:58.360]  Yeah.
[30:59.740 --> 31:00.540]  Leave a comment.
[31:01.140 --> 31:01.580]  Yeah.
[31:07.400 --> 31:08.320]  What are you doing, Red?
[31:09.060 --> 31:09.960]  Andrew's giving space.
[31:10.200 --> 31:10.740]  He's giving space.
[31:10.740 --> 31:11.260]  He's creating space.
[31:11.960 --> 31:13.480]  Because we all get bunched up.
[31:13.480 --> 31:15.360]  I think it's making him uncomfortable how close we are to him.
[31:15.480 --> 31:17.320]  I gotta wait until they get a little more in here.
[31:17.380 --> 31:17.900]  Yeah, you got it.
[31:17.980 --> 31:18.220]  You're good.
[31:18.740 --> 31:20.040]  We only need three, right?
[31:20.480 --> 31:21.360]  I don't think so.
[31:21.880 --> 31:23.220]  I think it might just be three.
[31:25.800 --> 31:26.860]  But we could be over...
[31:26.860 --> 31:26.920]  Go, go, go.
[31:26.920 --> 31:27.100]  Got it?
[31:27.360 --> 31:27.680]  Yeah.
[31:27.840 --> 31:28.500]  Go, go, go.
[31:29.620 --> 31:30.280]  All right, let's get moving, Geoff.
[31:30.280 --> 31:30.680]  Should I go over?
[31:31.020 --> 31:31.900]  Yeah, you need to go.
[31:32.020 --> 31:32.280]  Yeah, go.
[31:32.480 --> 31:32.900]  What are you doing?
[31:33.360 --> 31:33.760]  Thank you.
[31:33.820 --> 31:34.020]  Go!
[31:36.240 --> 31:37.640]  We got a problem here, Purple.
[31:37.740 --> 31:39.040]  Gavin, please go!
[31:39.240 --> 31:39.620]  Who, me?
[31:41.300 --> 31:41.860]  Hey, Gavin.
[31:42.000 --> 31:42.780]  You're at the front of the line!
[31:42.940 --> 31:44.480]  Gavin, you were totally in the right.
[31:44.640 --> 31:45.080]  Don't worry about it.
[31:45.080 --> 31:46.740]  I was waiting for the back to catch up.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.660]  Gavin, there's a reason that we just beat it.
[31:48.760 --> 31:49.640]  Because you were in the right.
[31:49.820 --> 31:51.420]  Because it's your birthday, and you were right.
[31:51.500 --> 31:52.100]  Don't listen.
[31:52.660 --> 31:53.940]  Don't listen to these other guys.
[31:54.120 --> 31:54.740]  Don't listen to them.
[31:54.880 --> 31:55.320]  You don't need them.
[31:55.340 --> 31:56.060]  Don't listen to Eric.
[31:56.180 --> 31:56.920]  What does he know?
[31:58.420 --> 31:58.940]  Stats don't lie.
[31:58.940 --> 31:59.760]  There's a reason we beat it.
[31:59.820 --> 32:01.180]  There's a reason we beat it, Gavin.
[32:01.320 --> 32:02.220]  And that's because you were at the front.
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.120]  Stats don't lie.
[32:04.320 --> 32:05.300]  It's the final whole level.
[32:05.800 --> 32:06.720]  This might be it, boys.
[32:07.280 --> 32:08.220]  Coffee Break says,
[32:08.340 --> 32:10.500]  I've been a comment leaver since before it was a thing.
[32:10.500 --> 32:11.260]  I love that.
[32:11.640 --> 32:12.800]  Oh, we got a health bar.
[32:12.900 --> 32:13.760]  I don't like that.
[32:13.820 --> 32:14.460]  Oh, boy.
[32:14.660 --> 32:15.900]  It's a boss fight, probably.
[32:17.640 --> 32:19.080]  Why are you guys all dead?
[32:19.220 --> 32:19.460]  Oh, it's ice.
[32:19.640 --> 32:22.860]  We got a subscription from migbommybilkers.
[32:23.020 --> 32:23.940]  Thank you so much.
[32:24.640 --> 32:25.360]  Thank you.
[32:27.560 --> 32:27.960]  Migbommy?
[32:30.400 --> 32:30.800]  Migbommybilkers.
[32:31.120 --> 32:33.100]  Yeah, you know, like, flip the words around.
[32:33.220 --> 32:36.840]  Instead of holding forward, tap forward a couple times.
[32:37.040 --> 32:37.600]  Yeah, just tap it.
[32:38.040 --> 32:38.400]  There you go.
[32:39.400 --> 32:40.900]  Did the floor get hit?
[32:41.080 --> 32:41.440]  What was that about?
[32:41.880 --> 32:43.360]  No, no, somebody got...
[32:43.360 --> 32:44.440]  I took some damage.
[32:44.660 --> 32:46.760]  Oh, somebody has to stay on that.
[32:48.560 --> 32:48.960]  Okay.
[32:49.580 --> 32:49.960]  Yeah.
[32:52.420 --> 32:53.220]  You saved me.
[32:54.060 --> 32:56.060]  All right, who wants to be the person on the button?
[32:56.720 --> 32:57.300]  I'll hold the button!
[32:57.640 --> 32:58.020]  Wow.
[32:58.300 --> 32:59.800]  Wow, boy, you just keep going, huh?
[33:00.340 --> 33:01.040]  Yeah, you just keep going.
[33:01.220 --> 33:02.060]  Long live the King's Nick.
[33:02.620 --> 33:03.400]  Tap forward, tap forward.
[33:04.200 --> 33:04.600]  Fuck!
[33:04.900 --> 33:06.160]  So, just me.
[33:06.340 --> 33:06.740]  Got it.
[33:07.960 --> 33:08.680]  How about that?
[33:08.680 --> 33:10.340]  Tap forward, tap forward, tap forward.
[33:11.240 --> 33:12.020]  Tap too much.
[33:12.180 --> 33:12.360]  Try again.
[33:12.560 --> 33:12.880]  Too much.
[33:13.720 --> 33:14.460]  So forward.
[33:15.100 --> 33:15.820]  Too much mustard.
[33:20.020 --> 33:21.840]  Why did you not go forward?
[33:25.400 --> 33:26.000]  Damn it!
[33:28.560 --> 33:30.800]  I feel like we're about to regress for a while.
[33:30.920 --> 33:31.900]  I'm in a poo loop, hold on.
[33:32.980 --> 33:35.220]  All you have to do is tap forward.
[33:35.960 --> 33:36.600]  Oh yeah!
[33:36.840 --> 33:39.180]  And not shit your pants, which is more important right now.
[33:39.260 --> 33:39.520]  There you go.
[33:39.660 --> 33:40.140]  There we go.
[33:40.520 --> 33:41.040]  Full health.
[33:41.180 --> 33:43.220]  So, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[33:44.400 --> 33:44.720]  Okay.
[33:45.180 --> 33:45.980]  That's gonna be Gavin.
[33:46.760 --> 33:47.100]  Here we go.
[33:47.260 --> 33:48.620]  Just don't shove me.
[33:49.100 --> 33:50.120]  Don't get off the button.
[33:52.160 --> 33:53.200]  So, if I hold...
[33:53.200 --> 33:55.340]  So, the person goes forward, holds the button, and then that's it.
[33:55.480 --> 33:55.940]  So, that's...
[33:55.940 --> 33:56.580]  So, it's just gonna be...
[33:56.580 --> 33:57.520]  We're gonna do one person.
[33:58.140 --> 33:58.680]  Just me.
[33:58.860 --> 33:59.020]  Great.
[33:59.580 --> 34:00.440]  So, it's gonna be one person.
[34:00.600 --> 34:00.940]  Thank you, Infinite Toast TV.
[34:00.940 --> 34:02.820]  We're talking, we're listening, we're learning.
[34:03.280 --> 34:03.920]  Infinite Toast.
[34:03.920 --> 34:05.980]  You already know this part!
[34:07.640 --> 34:08.700]  I wasn't paying attention.
[34:09.100 --> 34:09.800]  There you go.
[34:09.920 --> 34:11.060]  That's what you should have said.
[34:12.460 --> 34:13.120]  Alright, here we go.
[34:13.380 --> 34:14.060]  So, I stay on the button.
[34:14.080 --> 34:15.500]  I'm paying attention to you and not to this.
[34:15.540 --> 34:16.360]  You stay on the button.
[34:16.600 --> 34:16.980]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[34:17.060 --> 34:17.500]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[34:17.820 --> 34:19.660]  Andrew, you're gonna jump in, jump across.
[34:19.880 --> 34:20.180]  Yep, yep, yep.
[34:20.400 --> 34:20.680]  Okay.
[34:21.120 --> 34:21.440]  Andrew.
[34:21.440 --> 34:21.680]  Stop.
[34:21.680 --> 34:22.340]  We don't have time.
[34:23.200 --> 34:23.480]  Andrew.
[34:24.360 --> 34:25.780]  Oh, the screen keeps moving.
[34:25.860 --> 34:26.060]  Sorry.
[34:26.560 --> 34:26.800]  Sorry.
[34:26.980 --> 34:27.160]  Yeah.
[34:27.460 --> 34:27.700]  Sorry.
[34:29.480 --> 34:30.180]  That was on me.
[34:30.480 --> 34:30.860]  Got it.
[34:32.380 --> 34:32.980]  Try again.
[34:36.370 --> 34:36.690]  Okay.
[34:36.850 --> 34:38.550]  I think I see why you don't like Fortnite.
[34:38.550 --> 34:39.150]  Okay, Nick, you get on the button.
[34:39.270 --> 34:40.210]  Geoff, you're gonna jump across.
[34:40.810 --> 34:41.070]  Okay.
[34:46.710 --> 34:50.830]  Oh, come on!
[34:51.350 --> 34:51.990]  Austin is laughing.
[34:53.510 --> 34:53.830]  Combo!
[34:54.430 --> 34:54.830]  10 wins!
[34:55.310 --> 34:55.650]  Thank you.
[34:55.670 --> 34:55.830]  Combo.
[34:56.930 --> 34:58.730]  Alright, Geoff, you're gonna hit the button.
[34:58.890 --> 34:59.910]  Gavin, you're gonna jump across.
[35:00.350 --> 35:01.150]  Gavin, it's gonna be you.
[35:01.250 --> 35:02.050]  Gavin, it's all you, buddy.
[35:02.230 --> 35:02.850]  Here you go, Gavin.
[35:02.870 --> 35:03.770]  All the way, all the way.
[35:03.830 --> 35:04.350]  Stand on the button.
[35:04.350 --> 35:05.250]  You're gonna stand on the button.
[35:05.390 --> 35:05.750]  You're gonna...
[35:05.750 --> 35:06.250]  There you go.
[35:06.370 --> 35:07.570]  Alright, Geoff, go, go, go, go.
[35:07.810 --> 35:08.390]  Go, boys, go.
[35:08.650 --> 35:09.390]  There we go.
[35:10.470 --> 35:12.390]  Gavin, I need you to get off my head, buddy.
[35:13.990 --> 35:14.350]  Go!
[35:15.010 --> 35:15.930]  God damn it.
[35:20.990 --> 35:22.170]  That was chaos.
[35:22.850 --> 35:23.450]  Oh, only me?
[35:23.470 --> 35:23.690]  Just purple?
[35:23.950 --> 35:24.270]  Just Nick?
[35:24.550 --> 35:26.190]  Yeah, welcome to the first time, buddy.
[35:27.610 --> 35:28.210]  Oh, well.
[35:28.370 --> 35:29.350]  Interesting how you reacted to that.
[35:29.350 --> 35:32.130]  I needed a second to compose myself for that bullshit.
[35:32.850 --> 35:33.370]  Ugh.
[35:33.750 --> 35:34.890]  Get your bullshit together.
[35:35.050 --> 35:36.430]  What happens after that jump?
[35:36.570 --> 35:37.270]  I feel like I hit an invisible wall.
[35:37.270 --> 35:38.690]  Oh, Geoff pushed me is what happened?
[35:38.910 --> 35:39.070]  Yeah.
[35:40.370 --> 35:42.970]  Is there like a stop sticks there?
[35:43.470 --> 35:43.890]  No.
[35:44.570 --> 35:44.930]  No?
[35:45.590 --> 35:46.310]  Stay back.
[35:46.630 --> 35:46.950]  Stay back.
[35:47.090 --> 35:47.430]  Here we go.
[35:50.730 --> 35:51.250]  Alright.
[35:54.330 --> 35:54.850]  Unbelievable.
[35:55.870 --> 35:57.190]  Thank God it's your birthday, bud.
[35:59.230 --> 36:00.270]  Just us.
[36:00.810 --> 36:01.270]  Just Nick?
[36:01.270 --> 36:01.990]  Alright.
[36:02.150 --> 36:02.930]  No, it was Eric.
[36:03.130 --> 36:03.730]  Eric was there.
[36:05.790 --> 36:07.170]  Alright, Andrew, you're going to tap it.
[36:07.230 --> 36:08.210]  Gavin, you're going to go.
[36:09.150 --> 36:09.670]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:10.010 --> 36:10.550]  Just go.
[36:10.790 --> 36:11.130]  Just go.
[36:11.290 --> 36:11.650]  There you go.
[36:12.170 --> 36:13.430]  And then you're going to stay on that button.
[36:13.490 --> 36:14.750]  Stay on that button for as long as you can.
[36:14.830 --> 36:15.470]  Okay, go, go, go.
[36:15.630 --> 36:16.590]  Go, go, go!
[36:17.490 --> 36:17.850]  Oh.
[36:18.890 --> 36:19.250]  What?
[36:19.830 --> 36:20.890]  Everyone tacos me.
[36:22.390 --> 36:23.070]  Don't do that.
[36:23.390 --> 36:24.170]  Don't tackle them.
[36:24.610 --> 36:24.970]  Everybody.
[36:26.230 --> 36:26.570]  Just Nick?
[36:27.990 --> 36:28.850]  Yeah, just Nick.
[36:31.330 --> 36:32.170]  Here we go.
[36:33.010 --> 36:33.490]  Gavin!
[36:34.910 --> 36:36.310]  I don't want to do the jump.
[36:36.750 --> 36:37.750]  Alright, you do it, Eric.
[36:40.510 --> 36:41.470]  Go, Gavin!
[36:41.650 --> 36:42.010]  Go, Gavin!
[36:42.270 --> 36:43.130]  What is...
[36:43.130 --> 36:43.350]  What?
[36:43.810 --> 36:45.150]  What is your...
[36:45.150 --> 36:46.430]  What were you doing, man?
[36:46.570 --> 36:48.010]  Shouldn't someone hold the button down?
[36:48.510 --> 36:50.750]  Yes, I'm holding the button down!
[36:51.050 --> 36:54.090]  Eric got the fucking other button, which opens that lower level.
[36:54.390 --> 36:55.410]  Are you new?
[36:56.230 --> 36:58.270]  Right, but if someone stays on the back button...
[36:58.270 --> 37:01.810]  When everyone tackles the second button guy, it doesn't matter, does it?
[37:02.310 --> 37:03.470]  Why would anyone tackle the second button guy?
[37:03.470 --> 37:04.350]  He'll be dead!
[37:05.210 --> 37:08.530]  Every time I've been the second button, I've been obliterated into the slugs!
[37:12.230 --> 37:14.430]  This is unreal.
[37:18.300 --> 37:19.340]  It's so...
[37:19.340 --> 37:21.820]  It's like so not complicated.
[37:23.420 --> 37:24.220]  It's not!
[37:24.300 --> 37:25.060]  It's really not!
[37:25.200 --> 37:26.520]  It's so not comp...
[37:26.520 --> 37:28.280]  Gavin, how did you do that?
[37:28.440 --> 37:29.420]  Nick is gonna go.
[37:29.420 --> 37:33.500]  Nick is gonna stand on the button, and then I'm gonna go.
[37:33.640 --> 37:34.500]  Like this.
[37:34.900 --> 37:38.160]  And then I'm not gonna hit him, I'm gonna jump over him, and I'm gonna go!
[37:39.700 --> 37:40.560]  What happened to you?
[37:44.860 --> 37:45.820]  I just...
[37:45.820 --> 37:48.980]  Is it new every time we do it?
[37:52.460 --> 37:54.420]  There's a lot of pressure.
[37:55.080 --> 37:55.780]  It's not.
[38:00.600 --> 38:01.180]  Alright, go.
[38:01.880 --> 38:02.240]  Go.
[38:02.800 --> 38:04.260]  Just don't blast Andrew, and we're fine.
[38:04.940 --> 38:05.660]  Got blasted.
[38:05.700 --> 38:06.340]  Somebody blasted Andrew.
[38:07.500 --> 38:07.860]  Wow.
[38:08.300 --> 38:08.840]  Here are my thoughts.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.720]  If someone was still on the first button, it wouldn't matter.
[38:10.860 --> 38:12.920]  No, because there's no time for the first button!
[38:13.140 --> 38:13.620]  There's not?
[38:14.500 --> 38:15.920]  No, because that's why I fled!
[38:16.160 --> 38:16.980]  I was off the button!
[38:17.400 --> 38:20.900]  I also don't think you can cause the problem to prove that you're right.
[38:21.220 --> 38:21.740]  Yeah, no kidding.
[38:22.640 --> 38:24.560]  Yeah, you see what happens when I fuck it up, guys?
[38:24.720 --> 38:25.220]  Yeah, I see.
[38:26.300 --> 38:27.180]  Okay, I'm gonna go.
[38:27.360 --> 38:27.740]  Here I go.
[38:28.400 --> 38:29.220]  Now I'm going.
[38:32.300 --> 38:33.700]  Somebody knocked Gavin down.
[38:33.700 --> 38:35.760]  Fuckin' hit the A button, stupid fuck!
[38:35.920 --> 38:36.480]  That's me.
[38:36.640 --> 38:37.860]  I should've hit the A button.
[38:38.080 --> 38:39.000]  I'm a stupid fuck.
[38:41.300 --> 38:41.720]  Goddamn.
[38:42.960 --> 38:43.540]  Locked in.
[38:46.320 --> 38:46.940]  Go, Gavin.
[38:49.940 --> 38:50.500]  Oh, Gavin.
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.680]  It's your birthday, and I was trying to celebrate with you.
[38:56.740 --> 38:57.220]  It didn't work.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.620]  I was feeling the celebration.
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.160]  I was feeling the enthusiasm.
[39:01.160 --> 39:03.460]  I was watching it going, alright, Geoff's got this.
[39:03.540 --> 39:06.300]  And all of a sudden, Geoff was behind me, and I went, okay, I got this.
[39:07.020 --> 39:07.640]  Gavin, go!
[39:07.960 --> 39:08.300]  He's got it.
[39:08.380 --> 39:09.060]  No, he's got it.
[39:09.080 --> 39:09.560]  Watch this.
[39:09.720 --> 39:09.900]  Watch.
[39:10.520 --> 39:11.540]  Oh, we're dead!
[39:11.600 --> 39:12.960]  He's caught off the button.
[39:17.520 --> 39:18.980]  He got off the button!
[39:21.160 --> 39:22.760]  Okay, this one went around the world.
[39:23.020 --> 39:24.320]  This is my favorite level.
[39:24.640 --> 39:25.800]  This is my favorite level.
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.000]  This went around the world to being my favorite level we've ever done.
[39:29.100 --> 39:30.280]  This is so funny.
[39:30.720 --> 39:32.920]  This is the craziest fucking thing in the world.
[39:34.120 --> 39:34.760]  Absolutely insane.
[39:34.940 --> 39:36.240]  This is so nuts.
[39:36.380 --> 39:38.100]  This is my favorite thing we've ever done.
[39:40.520 --> 39:41.720]  Alright, now just don't bla-
[39:42.460 --> 39:45.320]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[39:45.380 --> 39:46.580]  Don't blast me, don't blast me.
[39:46.780 --> 39:47.300]  You're good, you're good.
[39:47.820 --> 39:48.280]  Okay, we're good.
[39:49.520 --> 39:50.180]  Get off me.
[39:50.340 --> 39:51.120]  Get the fuck!
[39:53.580 --> 39:53.900]  Dammit!
[39:55.760 --> 39:57.400]  We saw a little bit more than we did before.
[39:57.400 --> 40:01.930]  Mm, mm, purple.
[40:02.950 --> 40:05.250]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:07.510 --> 40:09.430]  Yes, full health.
[40:11.830 --> 40:12.990]  Geoff, it's up to you.
[40:15.570 --> 40:16.850]  Blue, what are you doing, man?
[40:18.630 --> 40:20.230]  Purple's a menace, blue's a menace.
[40:20.250 --> 40:22.130]  I didn't touch you, I did not touch you.
[40:22.690 --> 40:23.750]  No, you were sliding on your own.
[40:23.750 --> 40:25.330]  On my screen, you just ran right into me and knocked me off.
[40:25.330 --> 40:27.450]  I didn't touch shit, didn't touch shit.
[40:27.470 --> 40:28.970]  What are you talking about?
[40:28.970 --> 40:29.470]  Chat!
[40:30.170 --> 40:32.930]  Leave a comment, become a comment leaver, tell Geoff what's up.
[40:34.770 --> 40:37.310]  You skated me right off the fucking edge.
[40:37.310 --> 40:38.230]  No, I didn't skate shit.
[40:38.450 --> 40:41.450]  And meanwhile, I had Gavin's ass running around trying to distract me.
[40:41.730 --> 40:42.770]  No, I was trying to hit the button.
[40:44.550 --> 40:46.330]  Oh my god, I'll lead the way.
[40:46.690 --> 40:49.550]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[40:49.910 --> 40:51.970]  Shit, sorry, just momentum.
[40:52.810 --> 40:54.190]  Is the screen moving on its own?
[40:54.630 --> 40:55.070]  Yes.
[40:55.350 --> 40:55.550]  Yes!
[40:56.750 --> 40:57.190]  What?
[40:57.830 --> 40:58.230]  Gavin!
[41:00.050 --> 41:00.490]  Gavin!
[41:02.990 --> 41:05.230]  We've done this 30 times!
[41:05.670 --> 41:07.030]  I thought it was us that was moving it.
[41:07.910 --> 41:08.630]  Thank you.
[41:08.670 --> 41:09.210]  That's on me.
[41:09.370 --> 41:10.610]  That time I did knock a shit out of you.
[41:10.630 --> 41:11.470]  Schindler's Fist 10 times.
[41:11.970 --> 41:13.430]  Thank you, Schindler's Fist.
[41:14.910 --> 41:16.550]  I'm just, I'm floored.
[41:16.670 --> 41:18.270]  I'm so floored by what you just said.
[41:18.390 --> 41:19.430]  I can't believe it.
[41:19.750 --> 41:20.810]  I can't believe it.
[41:20.810 --> 41:22.350]  But it stops sometimes, doesn't it?
[41:23.310 --> 41:23.750]  Nope.
[41:24.390 --> 41:24.590]  Stop.
[41:24.930 --> 41:25.370]  Purple?
[41:25.370 --> 41:26.170]  That one.
[41:26.330 --> 41:27.470]  Oh, it stops when we die.
[41:27.610 --> 41:28.390]  Oh, okay.
[41:28.450 --> 41:30.030]  Keep Nick away from me!
[41:30.610 --> 41:32.010]  No, no, no, it's gonna be alright.
[41:34.570 --> 41:38.590]  I'm just like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm floored.
[41:38.610 --> 41:39.010]  By Gavin?
[41:39.470 --> 41:39.830]  Yes.
[41:40.590 --> 41:41.490]  Hey, is the level moving?
[41:41.850 --> 41:44.130]  That's why I was telling you I can't stay on that last button.
[41:45.530 --> 41:47.350]  Cause look, death is coming.
[41:50.070 --> 41:50.430]  Don't.
[41:50.430 --> 41:51.170]  That was my fault.
[41:51.250 --> 41:51.890]  Geoff, Geoff.
[41:52.390 --> 41:53.470]  Pull the Nick there.
[41:53.630 --> 41:55.010]  Pull the Nick there.
[41:55.010 --> 41:57.330]  Oh, pull the Nick.
[41:57.330 --> 41:58.110]  I did it once.
[41:58.750 --> 42:00.110]  Purple got hit that time.
[42:01.430 --> 42:01.870]  Purple?
[42:02.410 --> 42:03.590]  What happened, what happened to Orange?
[42:04.150 --> 42:04.750]  He's fine.
[42:05.030 --> 42:06.430]  Oh, look, Orange got hit again!
[42:06.610 --> 42:07.510]  We're alive, aren't we?
[42:10.030 --> 42:11.470]  Yeah, I'm hitting something there.
[42:12.850 --> 42:13.230]  Gavin!
[42:14.230 --> 42:15.930]  You're not hitting the button, that's for sure.
[42:17.910 --> 42:19.130]  Nice, I'm alive, go.
[42:19.630 --> 42:21.610]  Get the fuck off of me.
[42:24.190 --> 42:26.770]  Oh, you can't jump once you're on the slug.
[42:27.310 --> 42:29.550]  You have to get off the slug to jump.
[42:29.590 --> 42:29.990]  Good to know.
[42:30.270 --> 42:30.350]  Oh, interesting.
[42:40.040 --> 42:49.220]  I hit something there, what is that?
[42:49.520 --> 42:51.880]  You hit the shit out of us!
[42:52.080 --> 42:54.180]  Yeah, me, it was me, you knocked me off the button.
[42:56.500 --> 42:56.980]  Ooh.
[42:58.220 --> 42:59.180]  Just us then, eh?
[42:59.360 --> 43:00.420]  Oh, shit.
[43:01.000 --> 43:01.460]  Oh!
[43:01.640 --> 43:01.760]  What?
[43:03.120 --> 43:04.560]  Is the level moving?
[43:07.940 --> 43:08.800]  Alright, Gavin, go.
[43:09.280 --> 43:09.920]  Go, Gavin, go.
[43:13.640 --> 43:14.120]  Why?
[43:15.840 --> 43:16.940]  Why Nick, or why me?
[43:17.640 --> 43:18.920]  Just all of it, really.
[43:20.260 --> 43:20.740]  Purple!
[43:21.740 --> 43:24.160]  I did get bounced a bit by Geoff.
[43:24.180 --> 43:25.300]  But I continued my motion.
[43:25.940 --> 43:27.040]  I shouldn't have done that.
[43:29.560 --> 43:30.000]  Alright.
[43:31.640 --> 43:33.080]  Alright, he says.
[43:33.580 --> 43:34.020]  Alright.
[43:34.500 --> 43:36.520]  That one did get touched at all, that was just me.
[43:41.100 --> 43:42.960]  Sometimes you need a moment to just clear off.
[43:43.240 --> 43:44.720]  Guys, I think we're sliding on this map.
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.620]  Legitimately my favorite level we've ever done.
[43:47.480 --> 43:47.940]  Hehehe.
[43:51.340 --> 43:55.600]  It's important to slide, but not too much, and not too little, like Red just did there.
[43:56.140 --> 43:56.780]  That's right!
[43:56.880 --> 43:57.480]  Yeah, why did Red do that?
[43:57.480 --> 43:57.840]  That's right.
[43:58.700 --> 43:59.160]  Oops.
[43:59.420 --> 43:59.840]  Gavin!
[44:02.360 --> 44:05.780]  I don't like where Gavin is auditorially right now.
[44:06.660 --> 44:08.240]  I feel like he's losing his mind.
[44:08.920 --> 44:09.420]  A little bit.
[44:10.380 --> 44:11.140]  Which won't be...
[44:11.140 --> 44:12.620]  What the fuck?
[44:12.620 --> 44:13.660]  What the fuck?
[44:14.680 --> 44:15.720]  Smack me in the face.
[44:16.220 --> 44:18.280]  There was so much space between us and the slugs.
[44:18.400 --> 44:18.980]  What the fuck?
[44:20.120 --> 44:21.220]  Just me and Red.
[44:22.480 --> 44:22.840]  Man.
[44:23.500 --> 44:23.840]  Fuck.
[44:24.900 --> 44:25.800]  Nice, full health.
[44:26.220 --> 44:26.620]  Great job.
[44:26.800 --> 44:26.900]  Alright.
[44:34.250 --> 44:36.190]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[44:39.350 --> 44:40.690]  You're so lucky it's your birthday.
[44:45.050 --> 44:45.410]  Nice!
[44:45.670 --> 44:46.390]  Full health once again.
[44:50.010 --> 44:50.910]  Oh god.
[44:55.830 --> 44:56.930]  Okay, you're good.
[44:57.290 --> 44:59.250]  Ah, sorry, I bounced off and hit his tail.
[44:59.250 --> 44:59.790]  Ah, you killed me!
[45:03.890 --> 45:04.490]  Nice!
[45:05.610 --> 45:06.250]  Gettin' it.
[45:07.930 --> 45:11.690]  Ah, I hit the invisible wall again!
[45:17.630 --> 45:21.830]  I will say, to Gavin's defense, I think there is something there.
[45:22.450 --> 45:25.310]  We're hitting something at the top.
[45:25.570 --> 45:26.870]  It's throwing me every time.
[45:27.070 --> 45:29.730]  Yeah, we're stopping way too fast when we jump from up there.
[45:30.290 --> 45:31.430]  There's something up there.
[45:32.910 --> 45:33.430]  What?
[45:33.710 --> 45:43.660]  Oh god.
[45:47.430 --> 45:48.090]  Got it.
[45:48.310 --> 45:48.450]  Okay.
[45:49.010 --> 45:49.450]  Nice.
[45:50.550 --> 45:50.710]  Okay.
[45:51.050 --> 45:51.570]  Try.
[45:57.310 --> 45:57.830]  Blue.
[46:01.750 --> 46:05.130]  That's legitimately, Geoff, I think that might be my favorite bit for this level.
[46:12.850 --> 46:15.490]  That was so my fault.
[46:16.730 --> 46:20.110]  I just rock-kicked Andrew in the face.
[46:21.750 --> 46:23.330]  Just me and Andrew.
[46:27.630 --> 46:28.290]  Not me.
[46:29.070 --> 46:30.230]  I'm sorry, Nick, what was that?
[46:31.690 --> 46:32.230]  I died.
[46:32.350 --> 46:33.010]  You looked pretty purple there.
[46:33.970 --> 46:34.770]  Ow, red!
[46:35.010 --> 46:36.510]  I looked pretty orange there!
[46:37.110 --> 46:38.790]  Red did that to me!
[46:39.130 --> 46:40.030]  It would let me go forward.
[46:41.270 --> 46:41.690]  Perfect.
[46:41.970 --> 46:44.170]  Geoff took some heat there.
[46:47.970 --> 46:51.130]  That was, sorry, that was just, I was trying to overcompensate for Geoff.
[46:54.290 --> 46:57.030]  You don't have to overcompensate for me being awesome.
[46:57.710 --> 46:58.490]  Just let me be awesome.
[46:59.870 --> 47:00.650]  You alright there, Nick?
[47:01.450 --> 47:01.750]  Yeah.
[47:02.270 --> 47:03.210]  Inhaled air the wrong way.
[47:11.300 --> 47:12.000]  Okay.
[47:12.780 --> 47:13.700]  Okay, we're good.
[47:13.800 --> 47:13.920]  Okay.
[47:14.460 --> 47:15.460]  Ah, fuck.
[47:16.360 --> 47:17.410]  Not good.
[47:23.460 --> 47:24.160]  Purple.
[47:24.580 --> 47:25.700]  What's your excuse, purple?
[47:26.600 --> 47:27.180]  I suck!
[47:28.500 --> 47:29.340]  That was green.
[47:29.480 --> 47:29.940]  Oh!
[47:30.740 --> 47:32.060]  What happened?
[47:32.940 --> 47:36.000]  What happened to orange and green that time?
[47:37.540 --> 47:38.020]  Ah!
[47:38.380 --> 47:47.480]  I think Eric wants to do that for real sometimes.
[47:47.760 --> 47:50.160]  This became a really good revenge level.
[47:52.960 --> 47:54.540]  This time I jumped.
[47:57.220 --> 47:58.340]  Ah, fuck.
[47:59.360 --> 47:59.920]  Gavin!
[48:01.180 --> 48:02.920]  I lost the plot there entirely.
[48:03.820 --> 48:04.580]  Alright, jump on me, bud.
[48:05.040 --> 48:05.480]  Ah!
[48:08.020 --> 48:08.360]  Okay.
[48:08.560 --> 48:09.140]  Oh!
[48:09.360 --> 48:10.500]  Gavin, I'm sorry.
[48:12.060 --> 48:13.120]  I died!
[48:13.300 --> 48:14.220]  Apologize to me!
[48:21.740 --> 48:23.320]  It's the funniest bit.
[48:23.680 --> 48:24.600]  It's so funny.
[48:25.260 --> 48:26.380]  You died as well.
[48:28.020 --> 48:29.800]  God, this is going to be like Newton's Cradle.
[48:29.800 --> 48:30.020]  Where are we?
[48:30.820 --> 48:33.160]  Get away from me!
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.340]  Gavin's just on my ass!
[48:36.620 --> 48:37.660]  I'm getting shoved!
[48:39.700 --> 48:40.100]  Blue.
[48:41.680 --> 48:45.500]  Someone's got the back of their hand on the back of my head, putting it in your ass.
[48:45.640 --> 48:45.860]  Geoff!
[48:46.240 --> 48:46.360]  Geoff!
[48:47.360 --> 48:51.980]  Geoff wants to be up at the front so bad until he's up at the front and it's the place he doesn't want to be.
[48:52.440 --> 48:53.920]  I hit something.
[48:54.440 --> 48:55.160]  I hit something.
[48:55.580 --> 48:56.720]  Yeah, you hit Gavin there.
[48:57.060 --> 48:57.660]  That was crazy.
[48:57.720 --> 48:59.060]  I was in the air and hit something.
[48:59.100 --> 48:59.820]  It brought me back.
[49:00.800 --> 49:02.020]  I didn't turn around.
[49:02.100 --> 49:03.420]  I was holding right the whole time.
[49:07.390 --> 49:07.990]  Good job.
[49:09.490 --> 49:10.790]  Oh, oh, stop!
[49:15.310 --> 49:17.270]  You fucking piece of shit!
[49:17.750 --> 49:19.750]  Why didn't the jump go?
[49:21.550 --> 49:22.870]  What just happened?
[49:23.810 --> 49:26.250]  Why did the jump go?
[49:28.890 --> 49:30.170]  Oh, Christ.
[49:30.330 --> 49:31.830]  What was that?
[49:33.630 --> 49:35.310]  Andrew scared the shit out of me. I jumped.
[49:35.690 --> 49:37.790]  Andrew scared the shit out of me!
[49:37.790 --> 49:40.870]  He was coming full speed, dude. He was coming full speed.
[49:41.610 --> 49:43.910]  I've been at the mercy of too many bumps.
[49:44.890 --> 49:46.270]  Oh, my God.
[49:47.910 --> 49:48.390]  Geoff?
[49:49.230 --> 49:50.190]  No, Geoff?
[49:50.370 --> 49:51.370]  I'm back here, dude.
[49:51.390 --> 49:51.910]  Back over there.
[49:52.850 --> 49:53.150]  Geoff?
[49:56.190 --> 49:58.250]  Geoff, please relax. Please.
[49:58.410 --> 49:58.750]  I'm begging you.
[49:58.750 --> 49:59.350]  I'm in the back!
[49:59.430 --> 50:01.230]  I held him back. It was all right.
[50:01.570 --> 50:01.850]  I'm begging you.
[50:01.850 --> 50:02.230]  I'm in the back!
[50:02.250 --> 50:03.410]  I'm begging you to relax.
[50:04.070 --> 50:06.050]  I'm begging you to relax.
[50:06.050 --> 50:07.850]  What are you talking about?
[50:08.370 --> 50:11.970]  You are so fucking squirrely in this thing, dude.
[50:12.070 --> 50:12.270]  You're nuts.
[50:12.270 --> 50:13.130]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[50:13.150 --> 50:14.830]  Look, I'm not even moving the controller.
[50:18.030 --> 50:19.050]  Eric, relax.
[50:19.390 --> 50:20.130]  You've got to relax.
[50:20.130 --> 50:23.710]  Just a hair early jumping off that button so I couldn't clear it.
[50:24.630 --> 50:26.130]  You're just going to have to relax, man.
[50:26.130 --> 50:26.690]  Just a hair early.
[50:26.690 --> 50:27.410]  Are you talking to Gavin?
[50:27.930 --> 50:28.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:28.610 --> 50:29.810]  Whatever the back button was.
[50:30.190 --> 50:30.450]  Okay.
[50:30.630 --> 50:33.670]  Just a hair early getting off that button because I jumped,
[50:34.010 --> 50:35.490]  but it was right when that thing turned away.
[50:35.710 --> 50:36.070]  Okay, there you go.
[50:39.930 --> 50:40.410]  Jesus.
[50:45.270 --> 50:47.070]  Gavin, you've got to relax.
[50:47.390 --> 50:48.590]  You've got to calm down, Gav.
[50:49.250 --> 50:50.910]  I'm hitting all kinds of stuff.
[50:51.170 --> 50:52.690]  What move was that?
[50:54.230 --> 50:56.030]  You jumped to the left?
[50:56.210 --> 50:57.710]  Sometimes you've got to relax.
[50:58.130 --> 50:59.830]  You jumped to the left!
[51:02.290 --> 51:03.430]  You put your hands on your hips.
[51:03.430 --> 51:04.670]  You jumped to the left.
[51:04.870 --> 51:05.630]  It's so crazy.
[51:05.770 --> 51:06.570]  Oh, that's on me.
[51:08.590 --> 51:10.210]  It's the pale background.
[51:11.010 --> 51:11.650]  This is so funny.
[51:11.890 --> 51:12.690]  It got me insane.
[51:16.430 --> 51:19.350]  Let's do the time warp again.
[51:20.150 --> 51:22.010]  Let's do the dot park again.
[51:23.670 --> 51:25.770]  Green, come on.
[51:26.290 --> 51:27.830]  Where was I landing there?
[51:27.970 --> 51:28.550]  Moron!
[51:29.530 --> 51:30.530]  That was...
[51:31.530 --> 51:32.870]  Just me.
[51:33.930 --> 51:36.170]  You guys got to relax.
[51:38.070 --> 51:38.910]  You know what?
[51:38.990 --> 51:40.130]  I'm glad you don't play board games.
[51:40.310 --> 51:43.250]  I feel like if we were in a room together playing a board game, I'd kill you.
[51:45.960 --> 51:46.220]  Sorry.
[51:48.040 --> 51:49.300]  But it worked.
[51:49.860 --> 51:51.200]  See, that's the perfect way to do it.
[51:51.260 --> 51:53.160]  Just have someone hang out on the first button.
[51:53.200 --> 51:53.520]  Green.
[51:54.180 --> 51:54.720]  I don't know.
[51:54.880 --> 51:56.820]  Are you not supposed to land on the slug?
[51:56.860 --> 51:57.860]  I landed on the fucking slug.
[51:57.900 --> 51:59.440]  I watched Andrew do the same fucking thing.
[51:59.960 --> 52:01.820]  Do the top, but not the back.
[52:02.000 --> 52:02.880]  The tail will get you.
[52:03.560 --> 52:04.100]  Tail will kill you.
[52:04.140 --> 52:04.380]  What?
[52:05.300 --> 52:05.600]  Yeah.
[52:05.880 --> 52:06.820]  It's a poisonous tail.
[52:07.300 --> 52:08.180]  Got a slimy butt.
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.140]  He needs to have his anal glands expressed.
[52:13.240 --> 52:14.240]  Oh my god.
[52:19.100 --> 52:20.140]  There's something...
[52:20.140 --> 52:22.240]  There's something in the air.
[52:22.540 --> 52:24.160]  There's something in the sky that we're hitting.
[52:24.960 --> 52:26.360]  It's so weird.
[52:26.460 --> 52:27.220]  Come on, red.
[52:38.580 --> 52:40.460]  You guys got it. There you go.
[52:41.920 --> 52:42.580]  It's okay.
[52:42.700 --> 52:42.960]  It's alright.
[52:44.220 --> 52:45.500]  Good work, Gavin.
[52:49.280 --> 52:49.760]  Nice.
[52:51.540 --> 52:53.260]  Oh no, this boar.
[52:53.880 --> 52:54.080]  Yeah.
[52:55.480 --> 52:56.720]  Assumed there would be.
[52:58.080 --> 52:59.120]  Wait, wait, wait.
[52:59.320 --> 52:59.860]  Go up on my head.
[53:00.200 --> 53:02.360]  There you go.
[53:02.460 --> 53:03.380]  Only one up there.
[53:03.720 --> 53:04.500]  The rest of us down.
[53:05.780 --> 53:06.740]  What happened?
[53:07.700 --> 53:07.720]  Gavin.
[53:07.720 --> 53:08.420]  You got it.
[53:08.520 --> 53:09.940]  Stack, stack, stack.
[53:10.660 --> 53:12.300]  You gotta relax, Gavin.
[53:12.460 --> 53:13.480]  Gavin, what happened?
[53:13.500 --> 53:14.600]  Why did we do that?
[53:14.600 --> 53:16.080]  We could have seen the ending.
[53:16.520 --> 53:16.620]  Gavin.
[53:16.680 --> 53:20.820]  I was looking down at the timing when I could jump on and I just sloughed off because of the ice.
[53:21.180 --> 53:23.200]  What? Stay on the thing and just keep jumping.
[53:24.040 --> 53:25.720]  Just get on it and keep jumping.
[53:26.200 --> 53:26.820]  I'll do it.
[53:26.940 --> 53:27.100]  Gavin.
[53:28.420 --> 53:29.680]  Gavin, that was the thank you.
[53:29.760 --> 53:30.600]  Did you stop to read again?
[53:37.340 --> 53:38.100]  That was tough.
[53:38.200 --> 53:39.380]  That was tough because I was on your head.
[53:45.300 --> 53:45.660]  Red!
[53:46.800 --> 53:47.800]  It's fucking red.
[53:48.480 --> 53:49.200]  Every time.
[53:50.800 --> 53:53.020]  The chat going, anyone read what that said?
[53:54.740 --> 53:56.680]  I'm always throwing whenever there's text.
[53:58.220 --> 53:58.660]  What?
[53:59.480 --> 54:00.480]  You read a book before?
[54:00.920 --> 54:01.320]  Purple.
[54:01.960 --> 54:02.760]  Yeah, get him, Nick.
[54:02.980 --> 54:03.400]  I'm waiting for the joke to kill myself.
[54:04.460 --> 54:05.340]  Yeah, I got him.
[54:05.440 --> 54:06.280]  You ever read a book?
[54:06.820 --> 54:07.260]  Fuck!
[54:07.720 --> 54:08.900]  That was on me.
[54:11.620 --> 54:12.760]  I deserve that.
[54:13.240 --> 54:13.520]  You know what?
[54:13.540 --> 54:14.220]  Happy birthday, Gavin.
[54:14.520 --> 54:15.540]  That's my gift to you.
[54:15.780 --> 54:17.980]  I'll die twice in a row for that shitty joke.
[54:22.180 --> 54:23.220]  Dude, I...
[54:23.220 --> 54:24.900]  Is there something there or not?
[54:25.020 --> 54:26.660]  That's the fucking craziest shit.
[54:26.960 --> 54:28.720]  There's a thing that we keep slamming into.
[54:29.120 --> 54:31.260]  There's a thing that only the two of you hit.
[54:31.480 --> 54:32.680]  I'm not hitting left.
[54:32.680 --> 54:34.180]  Why am I going left?
[54:34.740 --> 54:36.360]  What the fuck is that?
[54:38.460 --> 54:41.300]  Yeah, Nick didn't hit it.
[54:41.980 --> 54:42.980]  It's because it's not there.
[54:47.060 --> 54:48.100]  That's crazy.
[54:48.680 --> 54:48.940]  That's on me.
[54:51.340 --> 54:53.460]  Who the fuck is calling me right now?
[54:55.540 --> 54:55.980]  Okay.
[54:59.960 --> 55:00.940]  Alright, up and over.
[55:01.860 --> 55:03.720]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[55:04.620 --> 55:05.500]  Everybody relax.
[55:05.880 --> 55:06.480]  Here we go.
[55:07.080 --> 55:07.520]  Fuck!
[55:07.820 --> 55:09.640]  You see, Nick didn't relax there.
[55:09.960 --> 55:11.660]  No, I mistimed it. I mistimed it.
[55:13.720 --> 55:14.160]  Ow!
[55:15.260 --> 55:15.700]  Boom!
[55:15.800 --> 55:16.780]  Gavin, you gotta relax.
[55:17.500 --> 55:18.660]  I was a little too relaxed there.
[55:18.660 --> 55:19.080]  That was Gavin.
[55:19.480 --> 55:20.960]  It was Gavin, but I'll take it.
[55:20.960 --> 55:23.220]  No, that was definitely you that time, though.
[55:23.420 --> 55:24.520]  But we're still alive, aren't we?
[55:26.280 --> 55:27.420]  It's funny every time.
[55:27.640 --> 55:28.300]  This is so good.
[55:32.480 --> 55:34.100]  Did everyone leave the button?
[55:34.540 --> 55:34.700]  Yeah.
[55:34.940 --> 55:35.280]  You shoved!
[55:35.380 --> 55:36.880]  I knocked the edge down.
[55:36.980 --> 55:37.260]  Okay.
[55:38.880 --> 55:39.340]  Everybody.
[55:39.600 --> 55:41.380]  Ah, just Nicky!
[55:45.800 --> 55:46.820]  We're alive, aren't we?
[55:46.840 --> 55:47.380]  Every time I do that.
[55:51.880 --> 55:52.360]  Sorry.
[55:53.820 --> 55:54.300]  Sorry.
[56:08.600 --> 56:10.120]  Good work, boys!
[56:10.760 --> 56:11.500]  There you go!
[56:12.360 --> 56:13.660]  That's how you do it!
[56:14.460 --> 56:14.980]  Get off me.
[56:17.180 --> 56:18.300]  What are you gonna do here?
[56:19.620 --> 56:21.080]  Get hit by a tail, duh!
[56:21.400 --> 56:23.500]  I'm gonna get hit by a tail of the worm!
[56:23.960 --> 56:25.400]  I'm gonna let the worm kill me!
[56:27.260 --> 56:28.600]  Ah, just us, Eric!
[56:32.800 --> 56:33.300]  Yeah!
[56:34.720 --> 56:35.500]  We're alive.
[56:39.740 --> 56:41.040]  It almost killed me.
[56:41.240 --> 56:44.240]  You made me panic so hard on that, Gavin.
[56:44.400 --> 56:44.620]  What is it, Gavin?
[56:44.860 --> 56:46.620]  You smashed my face on the net, coach.
[56:46.640 --> 56:46.920]  Yes!
[56:47.160 --> 56:48.280]  There is something.
[56:48.600 --> 56:49.080]  There is something.
[56:49.840 --> 56:50.340]  100%.
[56:52.920 --> 56:55.200]  But only for Gavin and Eric sometimes.
[56:56.140 --> 56:57.640]  Well, you keep running to the back.
[56:57.760 --> 56:58.480]  Why don't you go up there?
[56:59.020 --> 57:01.480]  I've done it a billion times both ways.
[57:01.800 --> 57:03.740]  I'm just staying in the back to stay out of everybody's way.
[57:03.820 --> 57:04.300]  Because everybody's...
[57:04.300 --> 57:05.420]  Fucking Christ.
[57:07.940 --> 57:08.740]  What happened?
[57:09.060 --> 57:10.460]  I panicked that I wasn't moving.
[57:12.800 --> 57:14.060]  Just old Nick.
[57:18.780 --> 57:20.300]  This might be my year of retirement.
[57:23.920 --> 57:24.560]  That's it!
[57:24.900 --> 57:25.440]  That's it!
[57:25.660 --> 57:26.320]  Andrew, did you see it?
[57:26.320 --> 57:28.220]  No, no, no, I just missed.
[57:28.540 --> 57:29.340]  That wasn't...
[57:29.340 --> 57:29.820]  What?!
[57:31.900 --> 57:33.940]  There has to be an internet issue then.
[57:34.060 --> 57:37.900]  I saw Gavin hang and stutter.
[57:39.020 --> 57:39.800]  We're alive.
[57:39.980 --> 57:41.080]  And then I was gripless.
[57:41.340 --> 57:42.620]  Or I was like full gripped on ice.
[57:42.720 --> 57:42.900]  Yes.
[57:43.320 --> 57:43.560]  Yeah.
[57:44.580 --> 57:45.040]  Yes.
[57:45.800 --> 57:46.900]  That was my fault.
[57:48.160 --> 57:49.420]  Yeah, but it's his birthday.
[57:50.160 --> 57:51.060]  Yeah, so it's not.
[57:52.920 --> 57:53.660]  We're alive.
[58:03.140 --> 58:04.600]  Easy boys, easy boys, easy boys.
[58:04.660 --> 58:05.340]  You got it.
[58:05.500 --> 58:06.140]  Thank you.
[58:06.380 --> 58:06.500]  That'd be Nick.
[58:06.640 --> 58:07.800]  That'd be Nick right there.
[58:08.340 --> 58:08.760]  Yep, yep.
[58:08.800 --> 58:10.760]  I'm gonna stop you right there.
[58:10.920 --> 58:11.600]  That's on me.
[58:13.020 --> 58:13.800]  Don't need to stop.
[58:14.120 --> 58:14.300]  Blue.
[58:14.720 --> 58:15.340]  Come on, Blue.
[58:20.000 --> 58:20.920]  Nice, fellas.
[58:23.240 --> 58:24.900]  Alright, you want me to jump on this thing and show you?
[58:25.380 --> 58:25.880]  Made it.
[58:26.260 --> 58:26.860]  Look at him go.
[58:27.200 --> 58:27.780]  Look at him go.
[58:27.840 --> 58:28.620]  That's our boy!
[58:29.040 --> 58:30.040]  Oh my God, I hit it.
[58:38.100 --> 58:39.640]  There was nowhere for me to go.
[58:39.720 --> 58:40.280]  Yeah, I know.
[58:40.520 --> 58:41.200]  It's hard.
[58:41.300 --> 58:42.580]  The timing on that's so tough.
[58:42.880 --> 58:43.500]  Very tricky.
[58:43.820 --> 58:45.100]  The slug's getting close.
[58:52.620 --> 58:53.600]  We're alive, aren't we?
[58:53.680 --> 58:53.960]  We're alive.
[58:54.520 --> 58:56.740]  I somehow don't have the most deaths.
[58:59.120 --> 59:00.260]  Oh, stopped again.
[59:01.480 --> 59:01.700]  Yep.
[59:02.960 --> 59:03.440]  Nice.
[59:05.600 --> 59:07.400]  Giant, mutated, ceiling hippo.
[59:07.600 --> 59:08.300]  10 gifted.
[59:08.660 --> 59:10.300]  You can get yourself anything on this website.
[59:10.980 --> 59:11.820]  Thank you so much.
[59:19.940 --> 59:21.420]  My in-laws are coming over for dinner.
[59:21.820 --> 59:22.560]  Yeah, what time's that at?
[59:22.640 --> 59:23.560]  You think we'll be done by then?
[59:23.620 --> 59:23.980]  I don't know.
[59:24.880 --> 59:25.640]  I don't know yet.
[59:26.680 --> 59:27.180]  Let's go, boys.
[59:28.320 --> 59:29.800]  Nick's thinking about dinner with the in-laws.
[59:30.140 --> 59:30.820]  Ah, shit.
[59:31.960 --> 59:32.760]  What are you thinking about?
[59:32.880 --> 59:33.340]  Yeah, get up, Gavin.
[59:33.340 --> 59:35.100]  I'm thinking about Nick thinking about dinner with the in-laws.
[59:35.920 --> 59:36.320]  Ah!
[59:38.260 --> 59:39.320]  Hey, we're alive.
[59:39.920 --> 59:40.840]  We're alive, baby!
[59:42.900 --> 59:44.640]  Giant, mutated, ceiling hippo.
[59:47.280 --> 59:47.880]  Oh, fuck.
[59:48.860 --> 59:49.220]  That was me.
[59:51.040 --> 59:52.660]  Big fan of the charming hat.
[59:52.760 --> 59:53.800]  Wait, is the screen moving?
[59:56.280 --> 59:57.380]  That, that, that.
[59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.760]  It really sent me over the edge where I went like,
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.200]  this might be the best thing we've ever done.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.220]  This is the funniest thing we've ever done, certainly.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.240]  Do you think when he played Mario as a little kid,
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.300]  he was that cloud level, just confused the shit out of him?
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.260]  Why, why do I keep dying from the back?
[01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:19.870]  What the fuck?
[01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.830]  What just happened?
[01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.850]  What is that? I don't give a fuck if it is your birthday.
[01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:23.750]  That was unacceptable.
[01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:26.390]  We were set there, man.
[01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:26.910]  That was crazy.
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:27.950]  We probably won that.
[01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:30.930]  I've got the most deaths.
[01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.770]  Yeah!
[01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.570]  ArcGamer, thank you so much.
[01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.910]  10 gifted for Gavin's birthday.
[01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:36.930]  Anything to...
[01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:42.750]  I just don't understand how you did that.
[01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:44.670]  I don't really either.
[01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.210]  I don't understand why you did it.
[01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:48.710]  Yeah, I also don't understand why you did it.
[01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:52.910]  I just go from everything's fine to everything's a nightmare in one second.
[01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:57.790]  Alright, well...
[01:00:57.790 --> 01:00:58.390]  Sorry.
[01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:59.370]  Okay, boys.
[01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.650]  You guys ready for those 501s here?
[01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:05.190]  You guys ready for those 501s?
[01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.690]  We're alive.
[01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:07.010]  We're alive.
[01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.570]  Get those 501s ready, boys.
[01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:09.730]  Get them ready.
[01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:17.310]  When the numbers come out for this one, I can't wait.
[01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:18.050]  I can't wait.
[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.150]  I'm so excited for the post on the subreddit.
[01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:23.530]  I might have to leave a formal letter of apology in the comments for this one.
[01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:25.890]  I don't really know what...
[01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:27.890]  I don't really know what to do.
[01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.790]  Doing great, doing great, doing great, doing great.
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:30.550]  Doing great, boys.
[01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:33.370]  What did you just do to me, you motherfuckers?
[01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:34.090]  I did get off you.
[01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:36.050]  I was off you long before you said anything.
[01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.570]  You walked me backwards to the old platform.
[01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:40.930]  501.
[01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:42.290]  501's in the chat.
[01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.230]  Let's do it.
[01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:45.290]  We're going to beat it right here.
[01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:46.590]  501, best time of the week.
[01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.210]  We're alive.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.280]  Gavin, you...
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.560]  I didn't touch you.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.380]  501.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.140]  You didn't touch me.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.020]  You stopped.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.440]  I didn't want to land on your head.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:03.240]  Your head.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.560]  Your head.
[01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.610]  Dude, I'm not hitting left.
[01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:14.310]  What is going on?
[01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:16.290]  I'm not hitting left.
[01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.730]  It's the Gavin and Eric wall.
[01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:20.090]  I don't understand.
[01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:21.190]  Like, what is...
[01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.310]  I'm holding right.
[01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:24.570]  It's a slippery thing.
[01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.050]  I'm trying to go one direction.
[01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:28.170]  It's not bullshitting anyone else.
[01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.730]  I don't understand.
[01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:30.050]  I don't get it.
[01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.710]  It's so frustrating.
[01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.150]  I didn't hit left!
[01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:37.430]  Critical scrumpage.
[01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:38.630]  Thanks for the five subs.
[01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:41.770]  What is going on?
[01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:42.910]  Let me hold...
[01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.070]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.470]  Nick, you are shoved central there.
[01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:49.590]  I held left.
[01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:50.150]  I held left.
[01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:50.510]  Okay.
[01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.290]  I clicked left.
[01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.330]  I thought Andrew was going to come to my defense.
[01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:53.990]  Never mind.
[01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.390]  Sorry.
[01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.650]  Sorry.
[01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:55.770]  Just a social...
[01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:58.470]  Let me hold this button because I...
[01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:59.250]  Dude, I don't know.
[01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:00.250]  All right, there we go.
[01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:02.990]  Holding left still doesn't stop you dead like that wall does.
[01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.730]  No.
[01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.610]  Whoa, whoa.
[01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:05.970]  That was a network latency thing.
[01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:06.330]  No, it's okay.
[01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:06.670]  It's okay.
[01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.010]  It's okay.
[01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.730]  It's okay.
[01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:08.230]  We're okay.
[01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.730]  We're all right.
[01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:09.030]  We're fine.
[01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:09.470]  We got it.
[01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.750]  We got it.
[01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:10.010]  We're good.
[01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:10.310]  Go.
[01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:13.630]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:14.490]  Wow.
[01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:20.150]  I got the stop dead right in front of the slug.
[01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:21.230]  Yep.
[01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.890]  Just reading...
[01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:24.870]  Eric, just reading in Gav.
[01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.270]  What?
[01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:26.550]  And gave?
[01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:27.950]  Oh, it's...
[01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:28.650]  Cool.
[01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:33.550]  Have you read?
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.190]  Oh, I went left that time and I didn't do that.
[01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:37.510]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.810]  I got it.
[01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:39.330]  I got it.
[01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:39.710]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:40.630]  We'll stand together.
[01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:41.150]  We'll stand together.
[01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:41.470]  Okay.
[01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:42.670]  He's got it.
[01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.030]  Kazula Games.
[01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:46.550]  Kazula Games.
[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:47.650]  20 gifted.
[01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:48.570]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.250]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:50.450]  Thank you.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:57.740]  Keep it going.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.140]  It's working.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:58.960]  It's working for us.
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:03:59.580]  It's working for us.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.240]  It's working for us.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:00.580]  I got it.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:00.900]  I got it.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.820]  I got it.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:05.980]  Everybody stick.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.800]  Fucking three of you.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:13.340]  Gavin.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:14.300]  Gavin.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.900]  He's out of my head.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.780]  He doesn't talk anymore.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.660]  I'm just trying to only concentrate.
[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:25.430]  The new online platform only concentrates.
[01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:25.910]  Sorry, Ralph.
[01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:27.030]  That's fine.
[01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.770]  We made it work.
[01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:29.010]  Get the fuck away from me.
[01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:29.850]  What are you...
[01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:30.770]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:32.170]  The slugs are about to...
[01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:32.870]  Okay.
[01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:34.050]  Nick, you're insane.
[01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.230]  Oh, fuck, man.
[01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.110]  You have the tail.
[01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:38.070]  He'll get you.
[01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.130]  Fucking tail.
[01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:46.270]  All right, green.
[01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:48.970]  No invisible wall.
[01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:49.890]  Gavin.
[01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.810]  My fault.
[01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.110]  My fault.
[01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:55.070]  Slipped.
[01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:56.870]  We're alive, aren't we?
[01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:58.090]  We're still alive.
[01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.770]  All right, Gavin.
[01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.050]  Up and over.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:07.660]  Sorry.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:08.460]  Sorry.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.400]  Oh, that wasn't you.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:10.780]  Got it.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.820]  Dropping logs, cranking hogs, five gifted.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.420]  Thank you.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.400]  That made me laugh.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.420]  I fucked up.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.300]  Baby teeth pod in the chat.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.360]  Is the screen moving on its own?
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.880]  When did you guys realize it was moving on its own?
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:30.440]  Immediately.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.540]  Ten seconds in.
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.600]  The second go?
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:33.340]  Maybe?
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.580]  Not immediately, but there's a button push with it.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:37.380]  Okay.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:37.880]  Come on.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:38.580]  Come on.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.080]  We're okay.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:39.540]  We're okay.
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:39.960]  We're okay.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.200]  I'm going to stack on you, Nick, and I'm going to go to the top.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.160]  All right.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:43.660]  Go.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.020]  Right.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:44.220]  Right.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:44.500]  Right.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:44.720]  Right.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:44.980]  Right.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:45.300]  Right.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:45.900]  I got you.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:46.200]  I got you.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:46.520]  I got you.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:46.720]  Got it.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.240]  Everyone else go to the bottom.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.080]  Everyone else go to the bottom.
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:50.520]  Nick, it's okay.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:51.540]  It does not slide.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.500]  Do not try to slide.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:52.760]  Okay.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.940]  Gavin, can you get off my head, please?
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:55.540]  Yeah.
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:58.140]  Okay.
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.180]  Oh, what does it say?
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.780]  Nobody leave this.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:01.840]  Thank you.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:02.920]  Nobody leave this platform.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:03.460]  Nick, Eric, okay.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.140]  Just Eric, leave.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:05.400]  Get ready.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:06.620]  Oh, wait.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:07.920]  Now we all go.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.340]  We got more jumps.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.020]  Okay, don't press that.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:12.720]  Don't press it.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.340]  It's the death button.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.240]  Good research.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.080]  Good to know.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:15.900]  That was great research.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.400]  Yeah.
[01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:23.930]  Thank you.
[01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:27.970]  That's a little early for the thank you, don't you think?
[01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:28.510]  It is.
[01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.570]  It really sends you.
[01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:31.490]  It's tough.
[01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.910]  Marshall, not now.
[01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.170]  Jeez.
[01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:37.410]  Get him, Marshall.
[01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:39.190]  I got shoved so hard.
[01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:44.030]  That was...
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.000]  I think that's my favorite Geoff noise.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.220]  I'm telling you that...
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.160]  I got shoved left.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.700]  You did?
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.360]  Yeah, what happened?
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.200]  It's certainly a convenient excuse.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.080]  I'm telling you.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.280]  What are you two doing?
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.920]  I'm telling you.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.060]  Somebody's got to stand right on that button.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.600]  So, guys, when somebody crosses to the other side,
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.920]  you must stand right on that second button so the rest of the group can come across.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.840]  I think that's probably going to be that part of that puzzle.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:32.680]  If anyone in the audience is wondering how many of my deaths have been to extend time or just for content,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.000]  zero.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.940]  Not a single one.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:37.960]  The honest truth.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.000]  I don't think anyone was questioning that.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.500]  No, I never thought for a second.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.400]  Just in case.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:45.820]  Andrew?
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.020]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:49.500]  Okay, well...
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.040]  See, it's important to stay on the red button so we can all make it across.
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:55.380]  Tucker618...
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.860]  Wait, 61189.
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.880]  Thanks. That death was for you, Tucker. Thank you.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.100]  Appreciate the 10 subs.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.140]  It's alright, pup. Chill.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.500]  I'm so surprised when I don't get hit by the wall that I...
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.140]  See, once again, you're going to have to stay on that red button.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.780]  You want to stay on the button. You don't want to hit the other person.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.720]  It's like he pulls out a fucking telescope to scout the area ahead.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.420]  You just lock in.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:27.880]  I'm going to throw up.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.880]  Okay, on my screen, Andrew fell in, jumped back out, and I hit his wall.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.920]  I think all the ice creates a weird network problem.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:39.760]  Okay.
[01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.550]  What? No! A wall!
[01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:46.570]  Yes!
[01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.690]  You just stop moving.
[01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:52.370]  It's certainly a convenient excuse for Nick.
[01:08:54.190 --> 01:08:56.470]  And what was the excuse for that death, Geoff?
[01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.330]  That was Blue's death.
[01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.950]  That's my favorite level.
[01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.570]  Literally my favorite level.
[01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:13.630]  I've lived too many years.
[01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:19.910]  Marshall, stop rolling around!
[01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:21.570]  You're distracting the shit out of me!
[01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:24.850]  A lot of bad in that one.
[01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:27.150]  A rare Eric.
[01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:28.670]  Very rare.
[01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:31.430]  Eric just reading and gave a five.
[01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:35.090]  So am I involved in that username or not?
[01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.630]  Or is it just Gabe?
[01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:36.810]  I don't think so.
[01:09:37.690 --> 01:09:38.870]  Okay, Green, it's to you.
[01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:40.050]  Nope, it's Blue.
[01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:44.110]  Why are you standing on me? Go!
[01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:45.710]  I can't get down.
[01:09:47.610 --> 01:09:49.550]  Geoff, if you're in the front, be in the front.
[01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:50.610]  I was trying to be.
[01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:52.850]  I was up on the other platform.
[01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.510]  I was in the bleeding edge of the screen.
[01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:10.540]  Dude, I'm not hitting left.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.900]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.380]  I'm not hitting left.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.760]  Maybe you should try hitting left.
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:17.980]  I'll try.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.320]  I'll let you know how it goes.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.120]  Turn into the skid.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.980]  Maybe it's like letting go of the input mid-air just stops you dead.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.660]  I'll tell you what stops me dead!
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.920]  It's when I go flying.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.840]  Couldn't I be getting more texts from Bane right now?
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.260]  What does he want?
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.060]  I don't know.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.000]  Sorry, it's Gavin's birthday.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.060]  Sorry, Red knocked me off.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.600]  Yep, that was me. That was my fault.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.520]  Gavin, my jump vanished.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.400]  It's still alive. It's the A button.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.100]  Yeah, but when the floor vanishes, you've got nothing to push off.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:06.640]  Wow.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:08.640]  Wow is right.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.300]  I take responsibility for that one.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.180]  I've knocked the shit out of Gavin.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.760]  You guys gotta calm down.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.400]  I don't know why you stopped. Just keep going.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.020]  God!
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.200]  Andrew, I'm not sure if Andrew gave up or what.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.700]  No, it's all good.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.140]  We're all good.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.500]  No, I was just waiting for people to jump.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:37.260]  Oh.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.620]  Oh, Jesus, Nick. God.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.600]  The mall are in the chat.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.860]  Okay, guys, stop messing around.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.680]  I would love to.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.420]  Time to buckle down, guys.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:55.980]  Here we go.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:02.160]  The thing with Geoff and Gavin on that opening is they don't allow you to make a mistake.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.020]  Because they're going to make it.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:05.640]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.620]  It's like me using up the one life.
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:08.440]  Gavin, you...
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.080]  Why is everyone playing around with the button?
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.360]  Get past the guy with the button. Just go past him.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:14.620]  Yeah, I don't see.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.260]  I didn't move. I just didn't care.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.580]  All right, there we go.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:22.940]  Perfect.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:25.780]  Oh.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.380]  Oh, yeah, we'll see about perfect.
[01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.670]  Okay.
[01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:36.150]  Oh, shit.
[01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.950]  Me and you, Andrew.
[01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:38.450]  We got this right here, bud.
[01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:39.070]  Easy.
[01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:39.410]  There you go.
[01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:41.150]  I'm going to get on top.
[01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:41.670]  I'll wait for you.
[01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:42.330]  Fuck!
[01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:43.650]  Okay, I'm going to go to the top.
[01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:44.210]  Andrew, you ready?
[01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.890]  Here we go, Andrew.
[01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:46.410]  Yep, I'm locked in.
[01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:48.830]  Purple and the other one.
[01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.790]  Blue.
[01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:51.470]  It looks like orange and purple.
[01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:53.550]  Definitely saw purple there.
[01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:57.610]  I like...
[01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:00.110]  I am Bear Warrior writing a paragraph in the chat.
[01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.790]  We're going to have time to read it.
[01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:02.110]  Okay.
[01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:04.090]  Unreal.
[01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:09.390]  That was so fucking funny.
[01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:12.450]  So dismissive.
[01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:13.970]  Might not have been to us.
[01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:15.210]  It might have been to somebody else in the chat.
[01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:15.810]  Could have been.
[01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:16.830]  Either way.
[01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:18.250]  Glance over.
[01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:19.410]  Let's see what I can read real quick.
[01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:20.070]  Oh, not that.
[01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:23.930]  All right, boys.
[01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:24.610]  You can get over him, Nick.
[01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:25.010]  All right, boys.
[01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:25.490]  All right, boys.
[01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.970]  I know, I know.
[01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:26.510]  Here we go, boys.
[01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:27.150]  All right, boys.
[01:13:27.190 --> 01:13:27.270]  Here we go.
[01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.530]  Pretty scared of what Gavin's going to do.
[01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:29.450]  Thank you for giving me space, though.
[01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:30.570]  Okay, never mind.
[01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:31.890]  It turned around.
[01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:34.650]  Eric, you waited for the slugs to be so close.
[01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:35.610]  I'm trying not to.
[01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:36.930]  Oh, ow.
[01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:38.390]  See what I mean?
[01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:41.950]  There's a lot of paragraphs happening now.
[01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:43.950]  Ow.
[01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.530]  Still alive.
[01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:52.430]  If it's copied across eight different comments, it's easy to read.
[01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:55.610]  Sorry.
[01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.150]  Go locked in, boys.
[01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:00.250]  It's all right, the mod's got it.
[01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:01.130]  I'm not worried about this.
[01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:05.810]  This is such an awe audience happening right now in the chat.
[01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:09.990]  I kind of love it.
[01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.630]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.940]  It's like just a bunch of us.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.660]  That was really smooth up until that point.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.100]  Yeah.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.080]  Good cross.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.420]  Geoff saying it running immediately to the back is so funny.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.500]  Yeah, I'm staying in the back where I don't cause problems.
[01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:36.270]  Thank you, Gavin.
[01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.670]  Good adjustment.
[01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.910]  Thank you.
[01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:40.570]  All right, Eric, you want to land on my head?
[01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:43.330]  All right, Nick, here we go.
[01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.930]  Ready, Nick?
[01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:44.250]  Here we go.
[01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.930]  Locked in.
[01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:45.290]  Yeah, we got it.
[01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.790]  Let's do this.
[01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.670]  What the fuck is happening in the chat?
[01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:52.230]  They're helping us read the long paragraph.
[01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:57.190]  Okay, there we go.
[01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.990]  Is this a negotiation?
[01:14:58.190 --> 01:14:58.690]  What's going on?
[01:14:58.770 --> 01:14:59.490]  Oh, that's me.
[01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.870]  That's me.
[01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:00.230]  That's me.
[01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.550]  That's me.
[01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:00.930]  That's me.
[01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:01.250]  That's me.
[01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.890]  That's me.
[01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:02.590]  You got it.
[01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:05.390]  I had it.
[01:15:05.690 --> 01:15:09.330]  I went from standing on two platforms to zero being below me.
[01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:11.610]  Oh, look at Geoff.
[01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:12.430]  Geoff, look at you.
[01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:13.130]  Locked in.
[01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:14.430]  What I'm always doing.
[01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:15.390]  I'm always locked in.
[01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.830]  I got it.
[01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.910]  I got it.
[01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:16.210]  I got it.
[01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:16.510]  I got it.
[01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:17.250]  I got it.
[01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:17.610]  I got it.
[01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:19.250]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.110]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.030]  That's okay.
[01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:23.790]  What was that about, Gavin?
[01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:26.370]  Okay, how did I die?
[01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:31.450]  Once again, the platform dropped right as I jumped, so I had no jump, and then I freaked out.
[01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:32.870]  Guys.
[01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:33.830]  Oh my God.
[01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:34.310]  Oh my God.
[01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.710]  Guys.
[01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:35.770]  The screen's moving.
[01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:38.310]  What?
[01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:41.670]  Yeah, what?
[01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:43.090]  Blue?
[01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:44.190]  What?
[01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.670]  Okay.
[01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.410]  All right, you know what?
[01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:46.570]  I deserve that for that joke.
[01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:46.970]  All right.
[01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:50.450]  Not to brag, but I don't read.
[01:15:57.650 --> 01:15:58.950]  About to hit 100.
[01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:01.850]  I can't hit 100.
[01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:02.770]  Let's do it on this run.
[01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.650]  Yes, you can.
[01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:05.110]  I cannot hit 100.
[01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:06.250]  I refuse to.
[01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.350]  Okay.
[01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:09.410]  All right, well, that was purple.
[01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:11.150]  I know, I know.
[01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:12.490]  But I held my ground.
[01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:13.270]  Shut up.
[01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.430]  Go.
[01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.170]  What are you doing, Nick?
[01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:15.950]  You're a menace.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:21.380]  No!
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:23.140]  That was on purple.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.400]  I'm falling apart.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.180]  No, it's on blue.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.300]  All right, that's fair.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.200]  Oh, you're not.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.020]  Just trying to get him to 100.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.140]  Blue, what are you doing, man?
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:38.320]  Fuck me.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:38.680]  Fuck me.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.560]  You can go ahead of him.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.760]  You can go ahead of him.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.360]  Okay, I'm going up, Gavin.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.560]  Who's going to the second?
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.160]  Who's going to the second?
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:52.840]  Who's going to the second?
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.540]  Who's going to the second?
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:54.260]  God damn it!
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.620]  All right, Andrew, go.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.160]  Andrew, go.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.160]  Get the key.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:00.680]  Get the key.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.260]  Come on down.
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.040]  99 deaths.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:04.580]  Okay, shut up.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:05.720]  Shut the fuck up.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:06.460]  Shut up.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.500]  Everyone lock in.
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.020]  Okay, ready?
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:11.860]  Andrew!
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.760]  It wasn't Andrew's fault.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.220]  It wasn't my fault.
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:15.700]  It was the screen.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.740]  Wait, then how did we do that?
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:18.360]  What happened?
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.600]  We got on it too late.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.560]  We started moving too late.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:21.400]  Yeah.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:21.860]  What?
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.980]  The first time we did it, we were way ahead of the screen.
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.740]  See, the screen's moving.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:25.960]  No way!
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.040]  Wait, the screen's moving?
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:28.980]  We gotta run!
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:29.240]  Go!
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.100]  Go!
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.480]  I live!
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.660]  Well, there you have it.
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.100]  We almost beat the whole thing.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:35.880]  We can do it.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.740]  We can do it, Geoff.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.320]  We can do it.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:37.920]  We can do it.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.560]  We can do it.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.300]  Look, now I'm...
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.520]  I am Bear Warrior 100 gifted!
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:43.640]  No way!
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.720]  Oh, we have to do it now.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.020]  Oh my God.
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:45.840]  We have to do it.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.540]  We have to do it.
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.300]  Holy shit.
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.860]  I am Bear Warrior is a hero.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.560]  That's legendary.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.260]  Ultimate redemption.
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:54.540]  What an arc.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:55.560]  Holy shit.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.380]  I am Bear Warrior is all-time in the chat.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.480]  Make them a VIP right now.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:01.600]  That was phenomenal.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:02.560]  What a comeback.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:03.640]  What a move.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.360]  I am Bear Warrior is an all-timer in my book.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.280]  Incredible.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.620]  100 subs for 100 deaths.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.180]  Insane.
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:11.860]  Insane.
[01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:15.790]  Sorry.
[01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.750]  Andrew, phenomenal work there.
[01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:21.930]  Oh, I was laughing at that.
[01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:22.670]  Yeah, I noticed.
[01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:24.450]  You just murdered Andrew and he blew it.
[01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:25.690]  Yeah, I think, yeah.
[01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.710]  Yeah.
[01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:33.350]  Okay, Green.
[01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:34.090]  It's all you.
[01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.870]  I got it, I got it.
[01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:37.750]  Gavin doesn't, but I got it.
[01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:39.470]  Yeah, what happened?
[01:18:44.730 --> 01:18:45.910]  Just me, Geoff, and Nick.
[01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.850]  That's the team right there.
[01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.850]  Just once.
[01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:50.970]  Just once.
[01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:53.110]  What?
[01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:54.310]  Just once what?
[01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.810]  Which part?
[01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:56.990]  I would like to be the one that gets to eat life.
[01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:59.390]  Do it.
[01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:01.230]  I can't.
[01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:03.630]  Someone else always eats it.
[01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:05.030]  Gavin, go.
[01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.690]  Go where?
[01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:07.590]  What do you mean go?
[01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:08.030]  Ahead.
[01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.870]  You have to go ahead.
[01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.870]  You can keep moving up.
[01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.390]  You don't have to keep coming back.
[01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:12.130]  I was right in front of the screen, you dope.
[01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:17.070]  The screen keeps moving, Gavin.
[01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:20.870]  Alright, full life.
[01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:22.110]  Andrew, you can be the one.
[01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:22.810]  Eat your life.
[01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:25.990]  He doesn't need it.
[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.170]  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:28.370]  He says he wants to.
[01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:30.790]  Andrew's in robot mode.
[01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:32.290]  Fuh-no.
[01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:33.710]  No, no, no, no.
[01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:34.390]  Calm down, Nick.
[01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:35.750]  No is spelt with an F.
[01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:37.850]  Fuh-no.
[01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:39.090]  Fuh-no.
[01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:40.650]  Fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-no.
[01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.830]  Alright, I think I'm getting back in the zone here.
[01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.870]  Oh, great.
[01:19:44.410 --> 01:19:45.190]  Were you ever in it?
[01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.890]  Respectfully?
[01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.610]  Not this way.
[01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:50.850]  Are you saying you're getting back in the zone or you're backing into the zone?
[01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:52.530]  What?
[01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:53.290]  He's out of the zone.
[01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:53.650]  I'm out of the zone.
[01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:54.430]  He's out of the zone.
[01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:55.630]  He's not in the zone at all.
[01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:57.170]  Nowhere near the zone.
[01:19:57.810 --> 01:19:58.650]  Get out the zone.
[01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:01.370]  Blue, come on.
[01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:02.670]  Blue, how can you do this to me?
[01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:03.810]  I see what you mean, Andrew.
[01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:05.610]  My zone next time's blue.
[01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:07.450]  All the zone doubt knocked me out of the zone.
[01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:10.670]  Alright, boys, forward.
[01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:11.630]  Press, press, press.
[01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:12.490]  Go, go, go.
[01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:13.950]  Go, go, press.
[01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:15.570]  Here we go.
[01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.190]  Here we go.
[01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:16.790]  Here we go.
[01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:17.210]  Boom.
[01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:18.290]  We're good.
[01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:19.110]  Let's go, boys.
[01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:19.590]  Let's go.
[01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:20.270]  Here we go.
[01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.630]  Working worms.
[01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:22.430]  Here we go.
[01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:23.430]  Us against the worms.
[01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:23.950]  No worms.
[01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:24.610]  Here we go.
[01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.950]  Let's go.
[01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.530]  Up and down.
[01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.870]  Let's go.
[01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:27.530]  Who's going to the top?
[01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:28.530]  Who's going to the top?
[01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:29.030]  Let's go.
[01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:30.270]  Who's going to the top?
[01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.770]  Here we go.
[01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:31.190]  Let's go.
[01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:31.590]  Go right.
[01:20:31.690 --> 01:20:31.930]  Geoff.
[01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:33.070]  Geoff, let's go.
[01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:34.670]  Here we go.
[01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.990]  Here we go.
[01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.710]  This is it.
[01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:39.870]  Oh, it's so much slower than the thing.
[01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:40.530]  This is it, though.
[01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:41.750]  You can hop down, Andrew.
[01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:42.730]  You can drop down to this.
[01:20:43.090 --> 01:20:43.170]  Yeah.
[01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:44.730]  Tell me when to go.
[01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.910]  Just wait.
[01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:47.270]  As soon as you fucking can.
[01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:48.130]  Hang on.
[01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:49.170]  Go, go, go.
[01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:49.850]  Go, go, go.
[01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:50.630]  You guys are all going to come back.
[01:20:50.690 --> 01:20:51.250]  Oh, my God.
[01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:52.590]  Go, go, go, go.
[01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:53.170]  What are you doing?
[01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:54.630]  Go, go, go.
[01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:57.110]  Why are you jumping backwards?
[01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:57.690]  Gavin!
[01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.510]  Gavin!
[01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:01.270]  You're so lucky it's your fucking birthday.
[01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:02.950]  Everybody made up a Gavin.
[01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:06.770]  Just keep going forward.
[01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:07.770]  Gavin.
[01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:12.090]  Why did you go backwards?
[01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:13.010]  I just need a minute.
[01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:13.930]  I just need a minute.
[01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:19.970]  Why did you go backwards?
[01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:29.210]  Okay, here we go, boys.
[01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:29.710]  Press forward.
[01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.630]  Push it forward.
[01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:31.110]  Push it ahead.
[01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:31.490]  Here we go.
[01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:32.390]  Push it ahead.
[01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:33.070]  Push it ahead.
[01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:33.490]  Let's go.
[01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:33.970]  Let's go.
[01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.310]  Jump them.
[01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.670]  Let's go.
[01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:35.070]  Jump them.
[01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:35.450]  Let's go.
[01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:36.110]  Go, worms.
[01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:36.330]  Go.
[01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:37.090]  Fight the worms.
[01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:37.750]  Against the worms.
[01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:38.390]  We're against the worms.
[01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.790]  Here we go.
[01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:39.290]  Here we go.
[01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.950]  We're against the worms.
[01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:41.450]  Boom, we're up here.
[01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.590]  Nick's team.
[01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:44.130]  No, that's a load of bullshit.
[01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:46.950]  I agree, Nick.
[01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:49.190]  I think it's bullshit that you allowed yourself to be killed by that worm.
[01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:50.810]  Nah, the worm didn't touch me.
[01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.950]  Netcode.
[01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:55.730]  Nick, thoughts?
[01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:59.670]  I expected to land on Geoff's soft head and he wasn't there.
[01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:02.730]  You didn't wait for me to stick the landing.
[01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:05.690]  I was still sliding into place.
[01:22:05.690 --> 01:22:08.290]  I dropped my controller.
[01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:12.250]  I expected to land on Geoff's soft head.
[01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:15.450]  Fucking crazy.
[01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:18.830]  Got it, got it, got it.
[01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:20.530]  Alright, here we go.
[01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:23.210]  Oh my god, the freaking wall.
[01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:28.710]  It's like someone's shoving me into slug tails.
[01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:34.050]  Squid slug tails.
[01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:37.450]  I'm getting slug tailed like you wouldn't believe it again a little bit.
[01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:39.550]  There's no slug there.
[01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:42.130]  What was that, a slug?
[01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.410]  I got slug tailed.
[01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:48.510]  Hey, I took up the life.
[01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:51.070]  There you go, Andrew.
[01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:52.670]  How was it?
[01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:54.610]  Hey, you got it again.
[01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.630]  How was it?
[01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:58.110]  It's not what I meant.
[01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:00.510]  It's not what I meant.
[01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.750]  There you go, you got it.
[01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:02.750]  You did it.
[01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:03.410]  Last time, how was it?
[01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:04.490]  That was good.
[01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:05.430]  It's not what I meant.
[01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:08.570]  Is it everything you hoped it would be?
[01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:09.030]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:10.210]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:11.310]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:11.830]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:12.470]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.870]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:13.170 --> 01:23:13.470]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:14.430]  I'm on the button.
[01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:16.870]  If he's on the button, just go.
[01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:18.450]  Just go.
[01:23:18.970 --> 01:23:20.310]  Don't compete on his head.
[01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:21.190]  Just go.
[01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.230]  He was just in the air spitting.
[01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:25.330]  What are you lunatics doing?
[01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.950]  Perfect.
[01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:30.830]  We got it perfect.
[01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:33.410]  Perfect, he says.
[01:23:39.650 --> 01:23:42.670]  I was fighting with Nick for the button for some reason.
[01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.870]  I died.
[01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:52.430]  Okay, perfect.
[01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:00.290]  Geoff's soft head.
[01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:01.410]  I'm on.
[01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:03.190]  We'll do it.
[01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:04.110]  We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
[01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:05.110]  Oh my god.
[01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:09.730]  Oh shit.
[01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:11.410]  Shitbox.
[01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.930]  Can we get on me?
[01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.390]  Get on me.
[01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:13.870]  You going to the top, Gavin?
[01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:15.270]  Gavin, you going to the top?
[01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:15.750]  There you go.
[01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:16.910]  Alright, you got it, you got it.
[01:24:17.090 --> 01:24:17.470]  Here we go.
[01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:19.270]  Alright, get on, get on.
[01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.870]  Let's go.
[01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:21.250]  Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.730]  We're getting good, we're getting good.
[01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:22.370]  Alright, let's jump down.
[01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:23.350]  Yeah.
[01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:24.350]  Should I come off the back?
[01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:25.110]  No, no, no!
[01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.590]  No!
[01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:27.710]  If you leave there, we'll kill you.
[01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:28.450]  Oh.
[01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:29.990]  There you go.
[01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.150]  Go!
[01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:32.250]  Okay.
[01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.970]  Ready?
[01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:33.930]  Go.
[01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.950]  Go!
[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:40.570]  Yes!
[01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:43.350]  In, in.
[01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:44.350]  Everyone in, everyone in.
[01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:45.570]  Everyone in, everyone in.
[01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:46.370]  Oh yes!
[01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:49.270]  Oh my god!
[01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:51.190]  Oh my god!
[01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:51.270]  Oh my god!
[01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:52.130]  It was so close!
[01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.070]  Never play that again!
[01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:56.230]  What a way to end it!
[01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:57.710]  We did it!
[01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:00.390]  We did it!
[01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:01.190]  Guys, congratulations.
[01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:05.450]  We got a hundred point achievement!
[01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:07.450]  Incredible!
[01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:11.530]  You've witnessed history!
[01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:15.490]  I was hoping to get less deaths than my age, but I was a little bit off.
[01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:16.530]  Slightly.
[01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:21.210]  Instead, you got the amount of deaths for the age you feel you are.
[01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:22.710]  Oh my god.
[01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:24.370]  What a game!
[01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:26.110]  Incredible!
[01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:28.250]  What a celebration!
[01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:32.250]  Kelzulu Games with another ten gifted.
[01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:34.970]  SaltyStick, five gifted.
[01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:36.990]  This is incredible.
[01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:38.050]  I can't believe it.
[01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:39.530]  And it said thank you at the end.
[01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:40.890]  This is phenomenal.
[01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:47.630]  Geoff, Andrew, Nick, Eric, and birthday boy Gavin have done it.
[01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:50.690]  We've defeated Pico Park!
[01:25:54.330 --> 01:25:56.930]  Moving on in style.
[01:25:57.930 --> 01:25:58.890]  Never again.
[01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:00.830]  I can't believe we did it.
[01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:01.930]  I cannot...
[01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:03.670]  What did it say though?
[01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.910]  Oh, it said thank you.
[01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:08.030]  There's literally nothing left for us to do, right?
[01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:09.590]  Is there a Pico Park 3?
[01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.410]  Not yet, this just came out.
[01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:11.850]  Shut up.
[01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:17.650]  Thank you everyone who withstood that.
[01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:20.970]  Thank you BearWarrior for the 100 gifted.
[01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:24.790]  This has been an insane stream.
[01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:27.950]  I'm going to lie down on my back and kick my legs a little bit.
[01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:29.110]  God damn.
[01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:31.250]  Gavin, how are you feeling on your birthday?
[01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:34.990]  Got heartburn, need to poo, almost threw up.
[01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:41.010]  GemDrops, thank you for making the worst game I've ever played in my entire life.
[01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:42.270]  I appreciate you.

[01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:55.010]  We did it.
[01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.330]  And there it is.
[01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:58.050]  Thank you for playing.
[01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:59.290]  We've done it.
[01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:00.690]  Thank you guys so much.
[01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:04.250]  Gavin, I'm going to let you leave everyone with wise words for your birthday.
[01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:06.170]  Hello.
[01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:12.270]  There you go, wise words from Gavin Free on his 37th birthday.
[01:27:12.730 --> 01:27:13.910]  Are we not leaving?
[01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:15.810]  We should raid Jeremy, right?
[01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:19.850]  Yeah, who's logged in on the account that can raid?
[01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:23.090]  Everyone go wish Jeremy a happy birthday.
[01:27:23.970 --> 01:27:24.610]  What's his thing?
[01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.150]  Is it Jeremy's birthday?
[01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:28.830]  No, it's Gavin's birthday.
[01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.010]  Get out of here.
[01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:32.530]  It is duly noted.
[01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.450]  And you can just raid him there.
[01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:36.470]  He's backslash raid.
[01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:37.410]  You got that?
[01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:40.570]  Jeremy isn't on, they say now.
[01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:41.670]  Wait, Jeremy isn't on?
[01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:43.250]  Wait, what do you mean?
[01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:46.170]  I'm looking at his stream right now. Is he not on?
[01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:48.310]  Oh, okay. I don't know. I'm just reading the chat.
[01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:49.510]  Starting soon.
[01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:51.210]  Yeah, he started soon.
[01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.870]  He just went live.
[01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:53.730]  I'm going to re-raid.
[01:27:53.970 --> 01:27:54.710]  Raid started.
[01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.490]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[01:27:58.870 --> 01:28:00.670]  If Jeremy doesn't get this, then too bad.
[01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:01.610]  We'll see you guys next time.
[01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.950]  Bye!
[01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:03.530]  Bye!
