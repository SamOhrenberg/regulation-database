[00:00.000 --> 00:01.760]  We're playing a- we're playing a game!
[00:02.320 --> 00:03.820]  Welcome to the stream.
[00:04.020 --> 00:05.980]  It's the Video Game Robot.
[00:06.440 --> 00:09.900]  Oh my god, the Video Game Robot is here, guys.
[00:10.280 --> 00:12.200]  And that means- that means it's Friday.
[00:12.620 --> 00:15.420]  That's right, it's me, Rob64.
[00:15.980 --> 00:17.320]  Oh no!
[00:17.940 --> 00:20.640]  The stream has been taken over by Rob64.
[00:21.120 --> 00:22.640]  Eric, what the f***?
[00:22.980 --> 00:24.840]  Yeah, Nick's doing it too! What?
[00:25.240 --> 00:26.420]  Yay! We have toys!
[00:26.480 --> 00:27.920]  Yeah, we got toys!
[00:27.920 --> 00:30.280]  Oh my god.
[00:34.020 --> 00:35.240]  Rob's got a virus.
[00:35.860 --> 00:42.180]  The robots here in the Video Game Robot is ready to play Ultimate.
[00:42.300 --> 00:43.780]  What is this one called? Ultimate?
[00:44.820 --> 00:45.340]  Raccoon.
[00:45.540 --> 00:46.920]  Ultimate Sheep Raccoon.
[00:47.220 --> 00:49.140]  This is called Video Game Robot.
[00:49.500 --> 00:51.020]  Nick, edit this.
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.460]  This is the-
[00:52.460 --> 00:53.740]  Can you do me a favor, Eric, real quick?
[00:53.780 --> 00:54.960]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:55.120 --> 00:55.880]  Could you shut up?
[00:55.880 --> 00:57.860]  What the f***?
[00:59.620 --> 01:00.940]  He's not talking, it's Rob64.
[01:01.240 --> 01:02.120]  Yeah, tell him.
[01:02.720 --> 01:04.440]  It's me, Rob64.
[01:04.860 --> 01:08.720]  The AI has gone too far, or not far enough.
[01:09.160 --> 01:10.640]  These two days...
[01:11.780 --> 01:16.940]  If former RT Eric could hear you these past few days, he would kill you.
[01:17.040 --> 01:19.860]  Well, he would be stoked, because some of those songs were really good.
[01:20.160 --> 01:21.840]  Like, some of those songs f***ing ripped.
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.160]  I mean, this is old Eric. Old Eric became new Eric at Rooster Teeth.
[01:25.160 --> 01:26.400]  And now he's back to old Eric.
[01:26.540 --> 01:27.140]  I see.
[01:27.340 --> 01:27.540]  Yep.
[01:27.680 --> 01:28.720]  He regressed.
[01:28.880 --> 01:31.320]  And now I'm a little robot.
[01:31.660 --> 01:32.140]  Whoa!
[01:33.160 --> 01:35.080]  There's so many things on this. This is crazy.
[01:35.420 --> 01:36.640]  Oh, thank God you found that.
[01:36.780 --> 01:37.680]  Yep, no problem, man.
[01:41.520 --> 01:43.660]  Gavin, what are we playing today?
[01:44.520 --> 01:46.160]  This is Ultimate...
[01:47.160 --> 01:48.120]  Sheep Raccoon.
[01:48.480 --> 01:48.960]  Yeah.
[01:51.240 --> 01:54.520]  This is a demo. It's currently available, I believe.
[01:54.520 --> 01:55.220]  It is.
[01:55.220 --> 01:57.440]  Is this demo long enough to play for an hour?
[01:58.380 --> 02:00.520]  We'll have to... There's two levels.
[02:01.080 --> 02:04.860]  There's two levels. We'll really have to learn and succeed and see what this is all about.
[02:04.940 --> 02:05.360]  You know what I mean?
[02:05.400 --> 02:07.880]  I played one round of this. There's a definite learning curve.
[02:08.480 --> 02:08.800]  Oh, okay.
[02:09.160 --> 02:11.100]  Should we start, or do you want to wait until four?
[02:12.080 --> 02:14.740]  Let's wait until four. Gavin, you let us know when we start.
[02:15.120 --> 02:16.980]  Should we start, or do you want to wait 20 seconds?
[02:17.300 --> 02:18.920]  We can sit quietly if you want.
[02:19.340 --> 02:21.700]  Yeah, put your clock on the footstool.
[02:21.840 --> 02:23.940]  Yeah, pick your clock up off the floor.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.260]  It's never on the floor.
[02:26.980 --> 02:27.940]  Right, on the footstool.
[02:28.120 --> 02:30.560]  That's true, it goes on the floor a lot because the cats suck it up.
[02:33.020 --> 02:34.540]  Oh, you got any more pee in your office?
[02:35.060 --> 02:36.980]  Yeah, is this your office or what?
[02:37.360 --> 02:39.780]  No, it's all old piss, but it's faded.
[02:40.620 --> 02:44.160]  I only smell it now if I go on vacation and come back.
[02:44.160 --> 02:45.980]  Oh yeah, you're like used to it.
[02:46.340 --> 02:47.680]  You've got the nose blindness.
[02:48.440 --> 02:51.740]  Nose blindness is maybe the best feature of the human body.
[02:51.740 --> 03:01.540]  Okay, it's four o'clock. Let's say, Gavin, you are the chicken, I am the raccoon, Nick is the horse, and Andrew is da sheep.
[03:01.780 --> 03:03.500]  Did you make a sheep sound?
[03:04.320 --> 03:05.360]  Let's go to the farm.
[03:08.680 --> 03:12.940]  Maybe if we rinse the shit out of both these levels, we just go to ultimate chicken horse.
[03:13.200 --> 03:14.700]  I mean, that's not a bad idea.
[03:14.980 --> 03:15.480]  Okay, let's see.
[03:16.260 --> 03:18.980]  Buggy52, thanks for the 10,000 subs, Buggy.
[03:19.340 --> 03:20.420]  Guys, it's Friday.
[03:20.420 --> 03:22.560]  What is this?
[03:22.740 --> 03:24.020]  Nick, figure it out.
[03:25.900 --> 03:30.160]  So from what I can tell, some of the abilities that seem like you can hold and drop while playing.
[03:30.560 --> 03:30.960]  Oh, cool.
[03:31.500 --> 03:32.340]  What button is that?
[03:32.880 --> 03:34.280]  A B button, I believe.
[03:34.580 --> 03:35.560]  And what makes you go?
[03:35.900 --> 03:37.000]  Why is it saying no?
[03:38.380 --> 03:39.840]  Maybe it has to be on the track.
[03:39.980 --> 03:40.840]  It has to be on the ground.
[03:45.340 --> 03:47.460]  I don't like what you're doing.
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.580]  Okay, so we just have to make it to the end.
[03:49.580 --> 03:50.160]  Yep.
[03:50.280 --> 03:50.720]  Okay.
[03:50.840 --> 03:54.700]  You use the bumpers to adjust your positioning and the stick to move forward.
[03:54.860 --> 03:55.300]  Ow!
[03:55.400 --> 03:55.980]  Oh, fuck!
[03:56.200 --> 03:57.000]  Oh, no!
[03:57.760 --> 03:58.460]  Let me up!
[03:58.560 --> 03:58.920]  No!
[03:59.360 --> 03:59.600]  Okay.
[03:59.700 --> 04:01.100]  Oh, so you can keep going.
[04:01.520 --> 04:02.000]  Oh, okay.
[04:02.500 --> 04:03.300]  God damn it!
[04:03.440 --> 04:03.640]  Ah!
[04:04.100 --> 04:04.460]  Oh!
[04:05.540 --> 04:06.540]  I can't see!
[04:06.720 --> 04:07.340]  Oh, God!
[04:08.060 --> 04:08.420]  Dead!
[04:08.720 --> 04:09.220]  Go, raccoon!
[04:10.860 --> 04:11.300]  Okay.
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.580]  Raccoon wins.
[04:13.980 --> 04:15.120]  I don't know why I didn't jump.
[04:15.160 --> 04:15.880]  I'm so stupid.
[04:16.220 --> 04:17.020]  I'm so dumb.
[04:17.480 --> 04:18.160]  Why didn't I jump?
[04:18.160 --> 04:19.600]  Who's screen does it follow?
[04:19.700 --> 04:21.180]  Is it just following Nick's screen?
[04:22.480 --> 04:26.400]  No, it followed the action forward because I died due to not going far enough.
[04:26.740 --> 04:27.960]  Oh, you died?
[04:28.500 --> 04:28.720]  Yeah.
[04:28.840 --> 04:29.340]  Oh, I'm dead.
[04:29.460 --> 04:29.640]  Yeah.
[04:29.720 --> 04:30.840]  Have you played these games?
[04:31.160 --> 04:31.760]  Yeah, pay attention.
[04:31.880 --> 04:32.580]  What are you talking about?
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.720]  I just didn't see anyone die.
[04:36.520 --> 04:37.600]  Because you were going forward.
[04:38.080 --> 04:38.440]  Yeah.
[04:39.940 --> 04:40.880]  Those two died.
[04:41.440 --> 04:41.640]  Okay.
[04:41.720 --> 04:43.400]  That's why we're the only two that finished, you dunce.
[04:43.420 --> 04:44.660]  Trust me, I saw you finish.
[04:45.580 --> 04:47.280]  Oh, we're not going to be able to get past that, are we?
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.460]  Yeah, I guess we'll find out.
[04:51.100 --> 04:52.540]  What were you saying about the bumpers?
[04:53.220 --> 04:55.380]  You can like tilt.
[04:56.240 --> 04:57.360]  Yeah, it's like Trials almost.
[04:57.920 --> 04:58.620]  I'm the chicken.
[04:59.120 --> 04:59.420]  Shit!
[05:00.060 --> 05:02.640]  No, the raccoon is having trouble boys.
[05:02.860 --> 05:04.520]  Go, go, go, go, go!
[05:05.480 --> 05:06.520]  Stay alive, Raccoon.
[05:06.520 --> 05:06.880]  Oh, I made it!
[05:07.220 --> 05:07.580]  Oh, shit!
[05:08.240 --> 05:08.760]  Raccoon died.
[05:09.200 --> 05:10.260]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[05:10.880 --> 05:11.680]  I missed the coin.
[05:12.360 --> 05:12.640]  Woo!
[05:14.100 --> 05:15.660]  What does that do?
[05:16.780 --> 05:17.500]  Ooh, wow.
[05:18.600 --> 05:19.300]  I died.
[05:19.500 --> 05:21.220]  The TV, like, shoots beams.
[05:21.660 --> 05:22.660]  I got post-mortem.
[05:24.400 --> 05:25.220]  What, Nick?
[05:26.140 --> 05:26.960]  Doesn't have our names.
[05:27.660 --> 05:29.700]  Yeah, we just called out at the beginning who's what.
[05:30.400 --> 05:30.600]  Yeah.
[05:31.040 --> 05:33.420]  I'm the chicken. I'm the sheep.
[05:35.060 --> 05:37.540]  I'm the raccoon. Again, to be clear,
[05:37.900 --> 05:39.020]  I've already said that.
[05:39.160 --> 05:41.900]  I think if you hover over it, it tells you how to
[05:41.900 --> 05:43.180]  activate certain things.
[05:43.280 --> 05:44.980]  So someone had the soda a minute ago.
[05:45.060 --> 05:47.120]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[05:47.120 --> 05:49.120]  Oh, shit.
[05:49.380 --> 05:50.760]  I missed. Come on, boys.
[05:51.740 --> 05:52.620]  Raccoon tricks.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.500]  Extra points if you do tricks.
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.120]  Oh, really?
[05:57.560 --> 05:58.980]  That was sick. I did a trick.
[05:59.760 --> 06:00.820]  I did no tricks.
[06:01.740 --> 06:03.120]  X button is tricks.
[06:04.220 --> 06:06.220]  You can also do, like, front flips and back flips.
[06:07.140 --> 06:07.840]  What is this?
[06:08.560 --> 06:09.580]  Oh, this looks lethal.
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.500]  Oh, cool.
[06:16.460 --> 06:17.120]  There we go.
[06:17.120 --> 06:18.160]  All right.
[06:19.140 --> 06:21.540]  What the? Gavin, what the fuck?
[06:21.900 --> 06:22.140]  Hello.
[06:24.000 --> 06:24.720]  Oh, nice.
[06:25.060 --> 06:26.560]  That's crazy.
[06:27.040 --> 06:27.780]  Oh, my God.
[06:28.940 --> 06:30.640]  It's a battle axe.
[06:30.880 --> 06:31.220]  Go.
[06:32.620 --> 06:33.680]  Oh, shit.
[06:34.740 --> 06:35.940]  Let me live.
[06:36.980 --> 06:38.740]  Where am I going?
[06:38.900 --> 06:39.300]  Oh, no.
[06:40.820 --> 06:41.720]  Raccoon, go.
[06:42.340 --> 06:42.980]  Raccoon.
[06:42.980 --> 06:43.080]  Raccoon.
[06:44.820 --> 06:45.320]  Raccoon.
[06:47.840 --> 06:48.340]  Raccoon.
[06:48.520 --> 06:49.940]  Go, Barry, go.
[06:51.280 --> 06:52.620]  Oh, I didn't drop my
[06:53.140 --> 06:53.780]  fart bag.
[06:54.740 --> 06:55.880]  God damn it.
[06:56.140 --> 06:56.600]  Did a trick.
[06:57.840 --> 06:58.700]  Stop him.
[07:00.280 --> 07:01.360]  Raccoon rules, baby.
[07:02.600 --> 07:03.960]  You wish you did tricks.
[07:05.840 --> 07:06.400]  What? I died?
[07:06.980 --> 07:08.420]  Oh, you got so many points.
[07:08.660 --> 07:09.540]  How did I die?
[07:11.620 --> 07:12.460]  Look at that.
[07:12.620 --> 07:13.440]  Raccoon rules, baby.
[07:13.580 --> 07:14.340]  I'm going to catch him.
[07:15.340 --> 07:16.540]  I'm going to get these trick buttons.
[07:17.800 --> 07:19.480]  Oh, is this like a
[07:19.480 --> 07:20.540]  sticky nail wheel?
[07:24.130 --> 07:24.390]  Oh.
[07:27.660 --> 07:28.520]  I know what I want.
[07:28.660 --> 07:29.180]  Enjoy your table?
[07:30.480 --> 07:31.700]  I want this water gone.
[07:32.460 --> 07:32.840]  What?
[07:34.460 --> 07:35.500]  You blew up the water?
[07:35.720 --> 07:36.500]  I blew up the water.
[07:36.960 --> 07:40.200]  Oh, my God.
[07:40.200 --> 07:41.520]  What the hell is that?
[07:41.880 --> 07:42.420]  I don't know.
[07:45.540 --> 07:48.540]  Oh, boy. Oh, the raccoon's having trouble, boys.
[07:48.880 --> 07:49.460]  Oh, boy.
[07:49.980 --> 07:50.720]  Oh, my God.
[07:51.820 --> 07:53.820]  How did you get over it?
[07:54.400 --> 07:55.420]  I got rockets, bitch.
[07:56.580 --> 07:57.080]  Raccoon, no.
[07:58.700 --> 07:59.460]  The fan.
[08:00.080 --> 08:02.060]  Raccoon died. Oh, it's horse time.
[08:10.200 --> 08:12.300]  I don't think anybody got anything for that one, boys.
[08:12.520 --> 08:12.960]  Oh, yeah?
[08:15.420 --> 08:16.420]  Oh, a brolly.
[08:16.740 --> 08:17.320]  Oh, cool.
[08:17.900 --> 08:18.860]  Oh, a trampoline.
[08:20.520 --> 08:22.320]  Does that mean my fart bag just went...
[08:23.620 --> 08:24.380]  Oh, I still got a
[08:24.380 --> 08:24.760]  fart bag.
[08:25.880 --> 08:28.240]  Is that what you call your...
[08:28.240 --> 08:29.360]  Oh, there we go.
[08:30.120 --> 08:30.980]  Oh, dude.
[08:31.240 --> 08:33.300]  I can't get past my trap.
[08:34.840 --> 08:35.580]  Oh, God.
[08:36.140 --> 08:37.460]  Oh, my God.
[08:37.460 --> 08:38.900]  There goes the chicken.
[08:39.080 --> 08:40.320]  There goes the chicken.
[08:40.760 --> 08:41.060]  Stop him.
[08:43.340 --> 08:44.760]  Look at that.
[08:45.500 --> 08:46.060]  Masterful.
[08:47.220 --> 08:49.120]  Do you think you're going alone,
[08:49.220 --> 08:49.880]  old friend?
[08:50.680 --> 08:51.600]  I thought you were going to get teased.
[08:57.200 --> 08:59.360]  I need to start deploying these items.
[09:00.220 --> 09:00.780]  This...
[09:00.780 --> 09:02.760]  When you really start stacking the traps,
[09:02.900 --> 09:03.840]  this gets really fun.
[09:06.100 --> 09:06.900]  The controls
[09:06.900 --> 09:07.680]  are so weird.
[09:07.800 --> 09:09.280]  They are so weird.
[09:10.100 --> 09:11.040]  What is this?
[09:12.320 --> 09:13.840]  Oh, you can chain to that?
[09:14.200 --> 09:15.520]  When does this game come out?
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.100]  I don't know if it's dated.
[09:18.280 --> 09:19.860]  Are we allowed to stream it?
[09:20.420 --> 09:21.180]  It's a demo.
[09:22.120 --> 09:23.160]  It's a public demo.
[09:23.380 --> 09:24.860]  Yeah, we didn't get access to it.
[09:26.340 --> 09:27.840]  They were kind enough to send us
[09:27.840 --> 09:29.880]  codes to play this early, but at this point, it's out.
[09:31.140 --> 09:31.820]  Oh.
[09:32.680 --> 09:33.700]  Where's Horace?
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.660]  Maybe I'm all over the place.
[09:37.040 --> 09:38.460]  Oh, you can turn stuff?
[09:38.960 --> 09:39.140]  Yeah.
[09:40.700 --> 09:41.980]  Like the other game.
[09:42.660 --> 09:44.640]  Now we're getting into it.
[09:45.240 --> 09:46.700]  Gavin has awakened.
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.900]  Fall back!
[09:52.280 --> 09:53.040]  God damn it!
[09:53.960 --> 09:54.520]  Ow.
[09:55.840 --> 09:57.560]  Damn it, I keep getting swatted.
[09:58.140 --> 09:59.460]  Go that way.
[09:59.540 --> 10:00.800]  Go the other way.
[10:01.300 --> 10:02.240]  There we go.
[10:02.240 --> 10:02.700]  No!
[10:04.940 --> 10:06.520]  Stupid-ass horse, go!
[10:08.220 --> 10:09.100]  Die, shit.
[10:09.660 --> 10:10.900]  Oh my God, the horse.
[10:11.840 --> 10:12.800]  Oh my God, the horse.
[10:12.920 --> 10:13.980]  Hold on. You ready?
[10:14.280 --> 10:15.580]  Yeah, we're ready.
[10:16.080 --> 10:19.700]  What an idiot.
[10:20.340 --> 10:21.260]  What an idiot.
[10:21.260 --> 10:24.620]  Look, I see the fan through the characters.
[10:25.120 --> 10:27.480]  Are you guys ready to see something?
[10:32.820 --> 10:34.660]  Y'all ready for this?
[10:34.740 --> 10:35.260]  Aw, fuck.
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.340]  Alright, and that's gonna go right here.
[10:43.360 --> 10:44.260]  There we go.
[10:45.180 --> 10:46.520]  What the fuck is that?
[10:47.060 --> 10:47.880]  Is that honey?
[10:47.880 --> 10:49.480]  No!
[10:50.140 --> 10:51.160]  Oh, dear.
[10:54.880 --> 10:57.560]  I frickin' blew myself.
[10:58.220 --> 10:58.600]  No!
[10:58.980 --> 11:00.460]  Come on, Raccoon.
[11:01.240 --> 11:02.140]  Yes, Raccoon, go!
[11:02.940 --> 11:05.740]  What happened to me?
[11:06.340 --> 11:06.560]  Oh no!
[11:07.580 --> 11:08.520]  Please!
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.300]  Stop him!
[11:11.640 --> 11:12.040]  Raccoon!
[11:12.040 --> 11:13.120]  Stop him!
[11:15.480 --> 11:16.660]  Did you die?
[11:17.400 --> 11:17.840]  No!
[11:22.160 --> 11:23.800]  I don't know what's happening.
[11:24.100 --> 11:24.860]  I don't either.
[11:26.980 --> 11:27.960]  You don't have to know.
[11:28.020 --> 11:29.240]  The Raccoon wins, that's all that matters.
[11:29.820 --> 11:30.800]  Did you actually win?
[11:31.860 --> 11:33.660]  Yeah, I got through that round.
[11:35.100 --> 11:36.300]  Oh, I thought you won overall.
[11:36.960 --> 11:38.200]  No, no, no, I'm close.
[11:38.380 --> 11:39.280]  I'm just so close.
[11:39.820 --> 11:40.300]  Oh.
[11:41.400 --> 11:43.160]  How do you switch the items?
[11:43.300 --> 11:44.820]  You don't. There's one button for each.
[11:46.680 --> 11:47.160]  So...
[11:47.160 --> 11:48.100]  Shit!
[11:48.920 --> 11:51.380]  Oh, come on.
[11:51.560 --> 11:52.100]  There we go.
[11:52.400 --> 11:53.720]  That's how you do it, boys.
[11:55.220 --> 11:55.700]  Woohoo!
[11:56.860 --> 11:58.200]  How does he get through?
[11:58.400 --> 11:58.800]  Oh no!
[12:03.540 --> 12:04.020]  Raccoon.
[12:04.780 --> 12:05.600]  Raccoon baby!
[12:07.160 --> 12:07.600]  Well.
[12:11.500 --> 12:11.820]  Well.
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.260]  Moved the slightest inch.
[12:15.440 --> 12:16.040]  Raccoon rules.
[12:16.880 --> 12:18.240]  Oh, Raccoon with the points!
[12:18.540 --> 12:20.240]  He's got his little hands.
[12:20.740 --> 12:21.780]  Let's keep going. Let's do it again.
[12:21.820 --> 12:22.560]  I want to go to the other level.
[12:22.660 --> 12:24.320]  I want to beat you again. I'm on a roll.
[12:25.380 --> 12:27.300]  If Ferret wins again, I'm quitting.
[12:27.980 --> 12:29.780]  What? What the fuck is that?
[12:30.000 --> 12:30.180]  Huh?
[12:36.340 --> 12:36.780]  Yeah.
[12:38.160 --> 12:38.400]  Oh.
[12:39.560 --> 12:39.960]  Yeah.
[12:41.620 --> 12:42.800]  Throw some ice.
[12:44.640 --> 12:45.420]  Is that what this is?
[12:47.640 --> 12:49.140]  Where do we start from?
[12:51.080 --> 12:51.480]  Left.
[12:52.840 --> 12:54.000]  Left to right, baby.
[12:55.260 --> 12:56.000]  Here we go.
[12:56.980 --> 12:58.660]  Okay. How do you grind the rail?
[12:58.900 --> 13:00.800]  Just land on it and click A again, I believe.
[13:01.780 --> 13:02.780]  Okay, okay. Come on.
[13:03.800 --> 13:04.920]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[13:05.780 --> 13:07.260]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[13:07.260 --> 13:08.500]  No, no, no, no, no!
[13:09.200 --> 13:09.920]  Go, go, go.
[13:10.840 --> 13:12.340]  It's all based on where the bike is.
[13:12.760 --> 13:14.960]  So you got to find your bike somewhere good?
[13:15.120 --> 13:17.580]  Yeah. As long as your bike is still alive, you can respawn.
[13:18.160 --> 13:18.800]  That's bullshit.
[13:18.960 --> 13:20.380]  You almost won from that.
[13:22.500 --> 13:23.140]  What do you mean?
[13:23.280 --> 13:23.480]  The sheep.
[13:24.140 --> 13:26.340]  Oh, the sheep has played this before.
[13:26.680 --> 13:26.740]  Oh, spinning.
[13:31.060 --> 13:31.500]  Hmm.
[13:33.120 --> 13:34.460]  I'll get some spute.
[13:36.940 --> 13:37.300]  Ew.
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.120]  Sheep sucks.
[13:42.260 --> 13:44.240]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[13:45.520 --> 13:45.880]  Ha!
[13:46.040 --> 13:46.280]  Oh!
[13:48.120 --> 13:48.920]  That's a trick.
[13:50.320 --> 13:50.540]  Uh-oh.
[13:50.840 --> 13:51.860]  Come on, raccoon. Come on, raccoon.
[13:51.920 --> 13:53.080]  No, no, no, no, no!
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.560]  Make a bike. Make a bike.
[13:55.000 --> 13:55.820]  Not my bike!
[13:55.980 --> 13:56.440]  I'm dead.
[13:56.780 --> 13:57.600]  No, the bike!
[13:58.780 --> 13:59.800]  No, go backwards!
[13:59.800 --> 14:01.800]  Go backwards!
[14:02.800 --> 14:03.400]  No, the bike!
[14:04.220 --> 14:05.080]  Oh, you respawned.
[14:05.240 --> 14:06.220]  Oh, yes!
[14:08.120 --> 14:09.900]  Death, death, death, death, death.
[14:11.100 --> 14:11.900]  No points.
[14:12.240 --> 14:12.940]  What the fuck?
[14:14.380 --> 14:15.660]  Aw, give me some of that.
[14:16.240 --> 14:17.180]  Wait, what did I get?
[14:17.920 --> 14:19.060]  What does this do?
[14:19.220 --> 14:21.320]  I like that it's a bounce goo as well.
[14:22.300 --> 14:22.740]  Oh, what the?
[14:23.380 --> 14:24.760]  Oh, I just get to use it?
[14:25.520 --> 14:26.180]  Oh, shit!
[14:27.760 --> 14:28.780]  Here we go.
[14:28.960 --> 14:30.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, stay alive!
[14:31.000 --> 14:31.580]  No!
[14:33.280 --> 14:34.440]  Stupid sheep.
[14:35.320 --> 14:35.960]  We hate the sheep.
[14:37.120 --> 14:37.700]  Die!
[14:39.950 --> 14:40.240]  Tricks!
[14:40.900 --> 14:43.020]  And he didn't even use his gauze.
[14:43.380 --> 14:45.840]  Oh, you guys haven't even finished it yet.
[14:45.960 --> 14:47.020]  That's crazy.
[14:47.840 --> 14:49.420]  I'm gonna kill the sheep.
[14:49.420 --> 14:51.460]  Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.
[14:53.130 --> 14:55.280]  There will be a murder.
[14:57.380 --> 14:58.280]  Let's see.
[14:58.480 --> 15:01.380]  I think if I do this, I can sling right over it.
[15:05.160 --> 15:06.280]  Sheep sucks.
[15:07.760 --> 15:08.500]  Hmm.
[15:10.440 --> 15:11.840]  That's gonna be interesting.
[15:14.640 --> 15:17.060]  Nice, okay.
[15:17.060 --> 15:18.000]  Oh, no.
[15:18.260 --> 15:19.700]  Why am I going back and forth?
[15:19.960 --> 15:20.960]  No, raccoon!
[15:22.300 --> 15:23.380]  I'm gonna bark!
[15:23.960 --> 15:24.440]  Shit!
[15:26.440 --> 15:28.400]  Chicken, chicken, Gavin, what are you doing?
[15:28.540 --> 15:29.260]  You have to leave him!
[15:29.420 --> 15:31.120]  The sheep is still alive!
[15:31.640 --> 15:33.120]  Why did I go in fast?
[15:35.440 --> 15:36.020]  Oh, yes!
[15:36.420 --> 15:36.900]  Yes!
[15:37.580 --> 15:38.040]  Oh, shit!
[15:39.740 --> 15:40.220]  Recovery!
[15:42.860 --> 15:44.600]  What the fuck?
[15:44.600 --> 15:45.080]  How?
[15:45.080 --> 15:48.080]  I don't know, I just was mashing A and I flew up.
[15:48.340 --> 15:49.160]  This is some bullshit.
[15:49.560 --> 15:51.820]  That's some bullshit, that's not how physics work.
[15:51.880 --> 15:53.320]  You're cheating the damn game.
[15:54.740 --> 15:56.800]  At least, uh, it seems like, uh,
[15:56.900 --> 15:57.700]  Gavin's not gonna quit.
[15:58.840 --> 15:59.900]  We got that going for us.
[16:01.020 --> 16:02.460]  What's this picnic table about?
[16:02.520 --> 16:03.700]  I had a real time on it.
[16:04.180 --> 16:05.740]  You think it's a trap of some kind?
[16:06.980 --> 16:08.780]  You land on it, I think it just breaks.
[16:10.280 --> 16:11.060]  But I'm not sure.
[16:11.060 --> 16:16.170]  I'm not sure.
[16:16.170 --> 16:17.150]  Someone's being a fuddy-duddy.
[16:17.690 --> 16:19.390]  Think about it.
[16:21.070 --> 16:23.150]  Do I blow up all the water or just a bit of water?
[16:23.430 --> 16:24.490]  All of it, all of it.
[16:28.240 --> 16:29.100]  Oh, nice!
[16:29.600 --> 16:30.260]  Right decision.
[16:32.760 --> 16:33.640]  Oh, baby.
[16:35.260 --> 16:36.460]  Okay, okay, okay.
[16:37.240 --> 16:37.420]  Ah!
[16:38.880 --> 16:39.620]  Holy shit!
[16:40.400 --> 16:41.560]  I got walloped!
[16:41.560 --> 16:43.340]  Come on, come on, no!
[16:43.540 --> 16:44.140]  Raccoon!
[16:44.460 --> 16:44.600]  No!
[16:48.300 --> 16:48.900]  Wait!
[16:49.960 --> 16:51.520]  I'm still alive!
[16:51.820 --> 16:53.120]  I'm still alive!
[16:53.560 --> 16:53.840]  How?
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.260]  I'm still alive!
[16:58.020 --> 16:59.320]  Yes, fool!
[17:00.240 --> 17:00.700]  No!
[17:00.920 --> 17:01.840]  Go, go, go, go!
[17:03.040 --> 17:04.640]  How are you still alive?
[17:04.940 --> 17:05.740]  I'm still alive!
[17:06.120 --> 17:07.200]  You were trapped!
[17:07.200 --> 17:07.880]  No!
[17:09.120 --> 17:09.600]  Yes!
[17:10.600 --> 17:11.080]  No!
[17:14.920 --> 17:15.980]  Yeah, let's see.
[17:16.080 --> 17:18.180]  Michael Andrew Gavin, and who's the fourth?
[17:18.300 --> 17:20.420]  Yeah, welcome, I see you're a big fan of the podcast.
[17:20.720 --> 17:23.280]  Thank you for watching us every Friday afternoon.
[17:23.380 --> 17:24.260]  Really appreciate you.
[17:24.340 --> 17:25.280]  Thank you so much.
[17:27.160 --> 17:28.720]  That doesn't sound like you do.
[17:28.840 --> 17:30.580]  Yeah, as Michael, I love that.
[17:30.660 --> 17:31.120]  Thank you.
[17:32.620 --> 17:33.100]  Honey!
[17:34.660 --> 17:35.940]  Where am I?
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.380]  Oh, no!
[17:38.740 --> 17:39.600]  Oh, baby.
[17:40.140 --> 17:40.820]  Okay.
[17:41.960 --> 17:43.460]  I used up my fuel off-screen.
[17:44.140 --> 17:45.240]  Woo-hoo!
[17:46.640 --> 17:47.960]  Raccoon has done it, baby!
[17:48.780 --> 17:50.160]  I think you just died.
[17:51.460 --> 17:52.660]  Wait, what?
[17:53.060 --> 17:54.140]  You didn't go through.
[17:54.620 --> 17:55.780]  I went over it!
[17:56.180 --> 17:57.700]  Oh, come on!
[17:58.900 --> 18:00.260]  All right!
[18:00.260 --> 18:01.560]  That's great!
[18:02.600 --> 18:03.720]  You died!
[18:04.360 --> 18:05.860]  What the fuck?
[18:07.060 --> 18:08.300]  What the fuck?
[18:09.720 --> 18:10.340]  This game's pretty good.
[18:10.360 --> 18:12.200]  I made it first! I was there!
[18:12.300 --> 18:13.240]  I crossed the line!
[18:13.980 --> 18:16.280]  You gotta go through the finish line, not over it.
[18:18.580 --> 18:20.760]  Stupid. This game's stupid.
[18:21.220 --> 18:22.520]  Stupid sheep.
[18:22.640 --> 18:23.400]  I hate the sheep.
[18:26.760 --> 18:28.020]  God damn it.
[18:28.020 --> 18:29.320]  That worked.
[18:31.940 --> 18:32.580]  You were close.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  Oh, you bastard.
[18:35.740 --> 18:36.640]  Oh, we both died.
[18:36.940 --> 18:38.660]  We both fucking ate it, dude.
[18:39.460 --> 18:40.920]  We both fucking died.
[18:41.760 --> 18:42.380]  Stop.
[18:45.040 --> 18:47.980]  Oh my god, he's gonna make it.
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.200]  Woo-hoo!
[18:50.340 --> 18:50.880]  Not over!
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.980]  Schmuck didn't get the coin, though.
[18:55.600 --> 18:56.500]  There was a coin?
[18:57.200 --> 18:59.180]  Yeah, Gavin grabbed it and it just kept going.
[19:00.980 --> 19:02.520]  I'm coming for you, Andrew!
[19:03.560 --> 19:05.620]  I have not finished this once.
[19:06.960 --> 19:08.560]  Well, you did one time, but not really.
[19:08.560 --> 19:09.580]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[19:10.680 --> 19:11.700]  Well, like I said, not really.
[19:12.920 --> 19:13.540]  You know.
[19:14.120 --> 19:15.040]  What is this?
[19:17.520 --> 19:18.760]  Can you put the specimen
[19:18.760 --> 19:20.080]  on the conveyor belt?
[19:20.800 --> 19:21.900]  I don't know. I guess so.
[19:21.900 --> 19:22.520]  I think I did.
[19:23.440 --> 19:24.560]  The specimen.
[19:25.080 --> 19:26.240]  Do you work at a fertility clinic?
[19:29.260 --> 19:31.260]  Oh, I hate getting covered in spess.
[19:31.700 --> 19:32.640]  Oh, no.
[19:34.360 --> 19:36.020]  No, I went too far again!
[19:37.140 --> 19:39.320]  No, I went too far!
[19:40.320 --> 19:41.700]  There goes the sheep.
[19:42.520 --> 19:43.080]  No!
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.060]  Andrew, please!
[19:45.520 --> 19:45.900]  Goddamn sheep.
[19:47.460 --> 19:49.040]  You little bitch.
[19:49.040 --> 19:49.460]  Woo!
[19:50.560 --> 19:51.300]  Goddamn it.
[19:52.600 --> 19:54.720]  I got camera-balled.
[19:55.080 --> 19:56.480]  To the finish line!
[19:57.420 --> 19:58.980]  Oh, you died? How did you die?
[19:59.100 --> 20:00.020]  Yeah, what's post-mortem?
[20:01.060 --> 20:03.400]  Like, I was dead, but my bike made it through.
[20:03.860 --> 20:04.300]  Uh-oh.
[20:04.900 --> 20:07.280]  Ah, fart bag. I should've got the fart bag.
[20:10.160 --> 20:11.320]  Love a fart bag.
[20:14.120 --> 20:14.560]  Yes!
[20:16.140 --> 20:16.600]  Yes!
[20:16.600 --> 20:18.340]  Oh, God.
[20:19.640 --> 20:20.380]  Come on, come on.
[20:20.620 --> 20:21.160]  There we go.
[20:21.560 --> 20:22.500]  We're in business.
[20:23.140 --> 20:23.420]  Okay.
[20:25.700 --> 20:26.660]  Yes, yes, yes.
[20:27.620 --> 20:28.080]  Yes!
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.260]  Did you do it?
[20:32.880 --> 20:33.740]  I don't know.
[20:34.560 --> 20:35.260]  I think you did.
[20:35.680 --> 20:36.320]  I think so.
[20:37.580 --> 20:38.640]  Yeah, look at that.
[20:38.840 --> 20:39.640]  Gavin's in last place.
[20:39.640 --> 20:40.400]  Gavin sucks.
[20:40.640 --> 20:42.280]  Gavin fucking sucks.
[20:42.880 --> 20:46.520]  I didn't realize the coin gets knocked out of you when you get smacked.
[20:46.760 --> 20:47.600]  Oh, really?
[20:47.880 --> 20:48.200]  Yeah.
[20:49.040 --> 20:51.020]  What was that? A bin? Where did that go?
[20:51.620 --> 20:52.640]  I grabbed it.
[20:53.140 --> 20:54.560]  What is that? A bin?
[20:58.300 --> 20:58.820]  Alright.
[20:59.720 --> 21:02.100]  I think we might have too easy for too long.
[21:04.940 --> 21:05.680]  Oh, shit.
[21:05.860 --> 21:07.020]  That's a late-game punch glove.
[21:07.020 --> 21:09.300]  Yeah, that is, especially in the last round.
[21:11.560 --> 21:12.300]  Here we go.
[21:13.960 --> 21:14.680]  Oh, shit.
[21:15.220 --> 21:16.580]  Did either of us get it?
[21:16.720 --> 21:17.160]  Oh, shit.
[21:20.300 --> 21:21.100]  Oh, no.
[21:21.280 --> 21:22.200]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[21:22.260 --> 21:24.520]  No, no, no, no, no.
[21:24.720 --> 21:26.500]  Okay, it's all raccoon.
[21:27.220 --> 21:27.660]  It's all raccoon.
[21:28.140 --> 21:30.820]  It's all raccoon.
[21:32.760 --> 21:33.960]  It was all raccoon.
[21:37.140 --> 21:38.020]  Oh, sheep!
[21:40.440 --> 21:40.880]  Yeah!
[21:41.940 --> 21:43.040]  I want to play that level again.
[21:44.180 --> 21:45.400]  I want to play that level again.
[21:46.020 --> 21:47.900]  Now I get it. I understand it now.
[21:48.920 --> 21:49.400]  Unlocked it.
[21:50.020 --> 21:51.160]  Scrapyard, scrapyard, scrapyard.
[21:51.380 --> 21:53.220]  This is my level.
[21:54.620 --> 21:55.180]  Declaring it.
[21:55.520 --> 21:56.740]  I'm going to kill you.
[21:58.680 --> 22:00.980]  It's your level because you lucked out the first time.
[22:01.020 --> 22:01.640]  Yeah, no kidding.
[22:02.140 --> 22:05.140]  I fucking looped you guys eight times on this track.
[22:05.140 --> 22:06.800]  I'm ready for this. This is my level.
[22:06.800 --> 22:08.200]  Bitch, you barely beat me.
[22:08.680 --> 22:09.160]  Barely.
[22:10.420 --> 22:13.360]  The beat part of that sentence is the key part.
[22:14.520 --> 22:15.480]  I'd highlight that part.
[22:17.040 --> 22:19.160]  I'd put the barely in small text.
[22:19.320 --> 22:20.960]  I'd lower the font on the barely.
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.240]  Bulled the beat.
[22:24.240 --> 22:24.860]  Alright, here we go.
[22:27.200 --> 22:28.240]  Okay, go raccoon.
[22:29.280 --> 22:30.240]  Go Chacon!
[22:31.220 --> 22:31.920]  Okay, here we go.
[22:31.920 --> 22:32.740]  Here we go.
[22:33.640 --> 22:35.820]  She passed the cheat again.
[22:36.680 --> 22:38.760]  There we go.
[22:39.760 --> 22:42.500]  Come on.
[22:43.620 --> 22:44.140]  No!
[22:44.720 --> 22:45.760]  No!
[22:46.320 --> 22:46.620]  No!
[22:49.760 --> 22:50.700]  That's phenomenal.
[22:51.160 --> 22:52.320]  I love that so much.
[22:52.320 --> 22:52.860]  No!
[22:52.860 --> 22:53.700]  You're welcome, dude.
[22:54.440 --> 22:55.000]  No!
[22:59.580 --> 23:02.000]  You're gonna have to go all the way back and around.
[23:02.160 --> 23:02.540]  Yes!
[23:07.260 --> 23:08.360]  That's who did it.
[23:12.400 --> 23:13.960]  That's what I'm talking about.
[23:15.360 --> 23:16.960]  I really like that position.
[23:17.120 --> 23:18.720]  That was so frustrating.
[23:19.120 --> 23:20.180]  Such a good fan.
[23:23.120 --> 23:23.640]  Oh.
[23:23.740 --> 23:24.860]  Two of us got that.
[23:27.140 --> 23:28.740]  How do we want to play this?
[23:28.800 --> 23:30.740]  Are we all going to the same spot?
[23:32.580 --> 23:33.500]  Oh, yuck.
[23:37.560 --> 23:39.860]  Now, be careful because if you grab the light
[23:39.860 --> 23:41.300]  and you sail right over
[23:41.300 --> 23:42.920]  the end point,
[23:43.240 --> 23:44.420]  it ends you.
[23:45.720 --> 23:47.600]  Oh, that looks like trouble.
[23:47.980 --> 23:48.620]  Here we go!
[23:48.620 --> 23:49.300]  Here we go, Raccoon.
[23:50.380 --> 23:52.280]  No! Backflip, Raccoon!
[23:55.540 --> 23:56.300]  Raccoon!
[23:57.020 --> 23:57.280]  Uh-oh.
[23:57.560 --> 23:58.320]  No!
[23:59.780 --> 24:00.100]  Yes!
[24:02.540 --> 24:03.580]  Oh, no.
[24:04.080 --> 24:05.960]  Oh, no, Eric.
[24:06.060 --> 24:07.320]  We're so fucked.
[24:11.240 --> 24:14.480]  I got golf-swinged over the level.
[24:14.900 --> 24:15.260]  Eric!
[24:15.260 --> 24:16.160]  Yes!
[24:17.320 --> 24:18.640]  I don't know how that happened.
[24:19.980 --> 24:22.200]  Gavin, you got whacked out.
[24:22.380 --> 24:23.900]  I got swatted like I was a golf ball.
[24:24.260 --> 24:24.780]  Look at that.
[24:24.920 --> 24:26.000]  And who's in first place?
[24:26.300 --> 24:28.100]  Everyone else sucks. The Raccoon rules.
[24:28.220 --> 24:30.320]  Look at him. He's on a coffee. He's on a dino.
[24:30.580 --> 24:31.660]  He's on a BMX.
[24:32.760 --> 24:35.100]  I need to fix the gaping hole
[24:35.100 --> 24:36.400]  that's after every level.
[24:40.500 --> 24:42.080]  Keep going down the abyss.
[24:44.780 --> 24:45.340]  Ah!
[24:46.620 --> 24:47.180]  No!
[24:48.280 --> 24:49.760]  Get rid of him! Get rid of him!
[24:51.860 --> 24:53.140]  No! No! No!
[24:53.240 --> 24:53.600]  No!
[24:54.420 --> 24:54.720]  No!
[24:56.920 --> 24:58.480]  Go, Gavin!
[25:01.840 --> 25:03.100]  What the damn?
[25:03.200 --> 25:05.760]  How do you use the sodding jetpack? I suck.
[25:05.920 --> 25:06.860]  It's so funny.
[25:07.680 --> 25:08.800]  How do you use it?
[25:08.800 --> 25:10.500]  It's so delayed, dude.
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.660]  Is that what happened?
[25:11.880 --> 25:13.600]  It's like a year after I pressed it.
[25:13.800 --> 25:14.860]  It takes forever.
[25:16.120 --> 25:17.880]  It's so funny, dude.
[25:18.300 --> 25:19.480]  It makes you look like a fool.
[25:19.700 --> 25:21.380]  Freaking son of the back of my ass.
[25:22.240 --> 25:23.800]  I know, I know, I know.
[25:25.740 --> 25:27.060]  What the hell are you doing?
[25:27.380 --> 25:28.180]  I'm putting it somewhere.
[25:29.420 --> 25:30.520]  It looks like a hot dog.
[25:31.120 --> 25:31.740]  It does.
[25:33.060 --> 25:35.580]  If Geoff was here, he'd be going crazy right now.
[25:35.680 --> 25:36.320]  I'm gonna eat it!
[25:36.320 --> 25:37.720]  Number 48!
[25:38.220 --> 25:39.580]  Yeah, he's really up there.
[25:40.120 --> 25:41.780]  He's in freak mode, dude.
[25:44.040 --> 25:46.240]  Gavin, you suck.
[25:50.160 --> 25:52.740]  Oh, someone slipped.
[25:53.660 --> 25:54.000]  That was me.
[25:54.680 --> 25:56.580]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[25:57.180 --> 25:57.580]  No!
[25:59.160 --> 25:59.520]  Yes!
[26:00.000 --> 26:00.480]  Go, raccoon!
[26:00.640 --> 26:03.000]  That doesn't even make any sense!
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.860]  Go, raccoon!
[26:05.240 --> 26:05.720]  Go, raccoon!
[26:05.880 --> 26:07.720]  No, no, no, no, no!
[26:08.840 --> 26:09.940]  Gavin got it!
[26:10.020 --> 26:11.440]  I left a coin behind!
[26:11.960 --> 26:13.000]  Son of a bitch!
[26:13.520 --> 26:14.820]  Come on, come on, come on!
[26:14.920 --> 26:15.980]  Live, live, live!
[26:17.980 --> 26:19.340]  Okay, no, wrong way!
[26:19.700 --> 26:19.860]  No!
[26:21.820 --> 26:22.700]  Ultimate speed!
[26:23.720 --> 26:24.340]  Ultimate speed!
[26:25.360 --> 26:25.500]  No!
[26:26.620 --> 26:27.100]  Yes!
[26:27.100 --> 26:27.600]  Yes!
[26:29.060 --> 26:29.940]  This sucks!
[26:30.420 --> 26:31.140]  Raccoon rules!
[26:31.880 --> 26:33.460]  I'm yet to make it through alive.
[26:34.040 --> 26:34.940]  I'm yet to make it through!
[26:35.140 --> 26:36.340]  You gotta start doing tricks, dude.
[26:39.940 --> 26:40.680]  Gimme that.
[26:43.120 --> 26:44.360]  Yeah, use the TV.
[26:44.620 --> 26:45.080]  Fuck you.
[26:45.300 --> 26:48.720]  If I can't get through...
[26:51.620 --> 26:53.660]  I wish there was a go fast button
[26:53.660 --> 26:55.200]  to where this is on the map.
[26:56.640 --> 26:57.940]  I think if you hold X
[26:57.940 --> 26:58.780]  you can move there faster.
[27:00.300 --> 27:01.680]  Oh, look at this!
[27:02.940 --> 27:04.580]  Ah, shit.
[27:06.320 --> 27:06.980]  Ultimate speed!
[27:08.760 --> 27:09.080]  Come on, recover!
[27:13.940 --> 27:15.400]  Come on, come on, come on!
[27:16.760 --> 27:17.300]  Come on!
[27:17.520 --> 27:18.560]  Oh, this is not good.
[27:19.460 --> 27:20.660]  My bike made it through!
[27:21.380 --> 27:21.820]  No!
[27:23.760 --> 27:25.320]  Son of a bitch!
[27:25.640 --> 27:28.120]  This rocket is worse than not having it!
[27:28.500 --> 27:29.060]  It's worthless.
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.340]  It makes you think that you have something, and you don't!
[27:31.400 --> 27:31.960]  You have nothing!
[27:34.340 --> 27:36.000]  Bloody cock sneeze.
[27:36.980 --> 27:38.020]  Didn't get me anywhere.
[27:38.620 --> 27:40.140]  Maybe I'll mix it with some soda.
[27:40.700 --> 27:41.120]  There you go.
[27:41.260 --> 27:41.940]  The soda's good.
[27:45.520 --> 27:46.120]  Ultimate speed!
[27:48.620 --> 27:49.220]  Ah!
[27:49.740 --> 27:50.280]  Raccoon!
[27:50.900 --> 27:52.360]  Oh no, my bike!
[27:52.600 --> 27:52.920]  No!
[27:54.460 --> 27:55.360]  Oh no, my bike.
[27:55.980 --> 27:56.580]  Raccoon!
[27:57.840 --> 27:58.820]  Ultimate raccoon!
[28:00.140 --> 28:00.740]  Ow!
[28:02.020 --> 28:03.000]  Come on, raccoon!
[28:04.740 --> 28:05.980]  Sheep's got the coin!
[28:06.580 --> 28:07.480]  Sheep's coining!
[28:07.760 --> 28:08.280]  No, no, no!
[28:09.720 --> 28:10.800]  I did it!
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.360]  Okay, here we go.
[28:13.360 --> 28:14.120]  Here we go.
[28:14.960 --> 28:15.580]  Ultimate speed!
[28:17.600 --> 28:18.060]  No!
[28:20.020 --> 28:20.300]  Yeah!
[28:21.880 --> 28:24.080]  It wouldn't let me do ultimate speed.
[28:24.880 --> 28:26.140]  You were going uphill.
[28:27.940 --> 28:29.120]  It's crazy, didn't it?
[28:29.300 --> 28:30.940]  You said it so many times.
[28:31.060 --> 28:33.400]  I said it so many times.
[28:34.460 --> 28:35.660]  I thought I was being really clear
[28:35.660 --> 28:36.580]  about what I needed there.
[28:37.220 --> 28:39.280]  Bouncy goo, bouncy goo.
[28:39.900 --> 28:41.440]  I want to reward someone
[28:41.440 --> 28:42.820]  for going over the level.
[28:44.380 --> 28:46.160]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[28:46.380 --> 28:47.880]  That is such a good idea, Gavin.
[28:48.420 --> 28:49.160]  That's it right there.
[28:49.460 --> 28:50.660]  But don't go too far.
[28:50.860 --> 28:51.060]  Yep.
[28:54.140 --> 28:55.060]  Okay, here we go.
[28:56.060 --> 28:57.440]  Out the gate, ultimate speed!
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.260]  Get me up there!
[28:59.120 --> 28:59.780]  Ultimate sprint!
[29:00.580 --> 29:00.780]  No!
[29:06.480 --> 29:07.400]  Wait, am I alive?
[29:07.880 --> 29:08.320]  Am I here?
[29:08.320 --> 29:09.760]  Nope, we're dead.
[29:09.980 --> 29:10.500]  Yes!
[29:11.900 --> 29:13.060]  Ultimate speed! No!
[29:14.260 --> 29:14.840]  Yeah!
[29:15.220 --> 29:15.820]  Raccoon!
[29:17.340 --> 29:17.940]  No!
[29:20.480 --> 29:22.820]  Oh, Eric might win this.
[29:25.140 --> 29:25.740]  Hello!
[29:26.820 --> 29:27.740]  Raccoon time, baby.
[29:27.920 --> 29:30.300]  Look at the tricks. The tricks, the difference maker.
[29:32.900 --> 29:34.060]  I'm turning tricks, Eric.
[29:34.240 --> 29:36.080]  You're goddamn right. Whatever it takes.
[29:36.080 --> 29:36.620]  Damn it.
[29:38.280 --> 29:40.220]  I'll suck any piece of popsicle out there.
[29:40.580 --> 29:41.440]  That's what I'm for.
[29:43.060 --> 29:44.560]  You fuckin' heard me.
[29:45.140 --> 29:45.680]  I did.
[29:49.390 --> 29:50.790]  Oh, Gavin, must you.
[29:51.230 --> 29:51.670]  A little bit.
[29:54.970 --> 29:56.530]  Ooh, a little swing and a coin.
[29:58.750 --> 29:59.450]  Ultimate speed!
[30:00.050 --> 30:01.190]  I'll leave you guys all behind.
[30:01.890 --> 30:04.210]  Shit! I went out the back!
[30:05.210 --> 30:06.470]  No, no, no! I killed myself!
[30:07.430 --> 30:09.470]  And you saved Gavin by doing it.
[30:09.470 --> 30:09.990]  No!
[30:10.770 --> 30:11.410]  No!
[30:13.010 --> 30:14.010]  The coin!
[30:16.070 --> 30:17.030]  The coin!
[30:17.290 --> 30:17.730]  The coin!
[30:18.090 --> 30:19.070]  You gave him a coin!
[30:19.430 --> 30:20.490]  Ultimate coin!
[30:21.490 --> 30:22.130]  No!
[30:23.630 --> 30:25.390]  Get the coin away from him!
[30:25.990 --> 30:26.190]  No!
[30:28.270 --> 30:29.230]  Come on!
[30:29.530 --> 30:30.070]  Raccoon!
[30:30.350 --> 30:30.810]  Raccoon!
[30:30.810 --> 30:31.930]  Come on!
[30:32.810 --> 30:33.370]  Raccoon!
[30:33.910 --> 30:34.470]  No!
[30:36.410 --> 30:37.510]  He's cheating!
[30:38.990 --> 30:40.870]  How the hell are you doing that?
[30:42.450 --> 30:43.010]  Raccoon!
[30:44.750 --> 30:45.390]  Oh, God.
[30:49.490 --> 30:50.050]  Fartbag.
[30:51.170 --> 30:52.430]  Oh, I already got that.
[30:52.510 --> 30:53.250]  Do I have two of it now?
[30:53.430 --> 30:53.630]  Yeah.
[30:55.950 --> 30:57.510]  Ultimate speed! Fartbag!
[30:57.510 --> 30:58.730]  Raccoon!
[30:58.730 --> 30:59.030]  Oh, shit.
[30:59.670 --> 31:02.230]  Oh, no, that got me killed.
[31:02.630 --> 31:03.030]  Uh-oh.
[31:03.810 --> 31:04.070]  Yes!
[31:06.170 --> 31:07.210]  Curiosity killed the sheep.
[31:07.630 --> 31:08.250]  Come on.
[31:08.810 --> 31:09.450]  No!
[31:12.630 --> 31:13.810]  Oh, Nick.
[31:14.470 --> 31:14.870]  Hello!
[31:16.810 --> 31:18.290]  Oh, no!
[31:20.410 --> 31:22.690]  I just want to finish the level.
[31:23.110 --> 31:23.490]  You did it.
[31:23.490 --> 31:24.530]  I finished the level.
[31:25.190 --> 31:27.210]  Last round, final round. Who can catch the raccoon?
[31:27.330 --> 31:28.430]  Nobody, nobody, nobody.
[31:29.370 --> 31:31.530]  I just need to do 150 tricks.
[31:32.950 --> 31:34.210]  No, I grabbed the wrong thing!
[31:35.870 --> 31:37.350]  Oh, what did I get?
[31:37.710 --> 31:38.810]  Oh, I got a punch glove.
[31:40.410 --> 31:42.810]  Let's get ultimate speed.
[31:43.770 --> 31:45.390]  Let's do a bit of speed before the point.
[31:45.950 --> 31:46.030]  Yeah.
[31:47.370 --> 31:48.790]  You know what else gives you speed?
[31:49.970 --> 31:50.770]  Ultimate speed.
[31:54.250 --> 31:54.690]  Unbelievable.
[31:56.830 --> 31:57.270]  Oh!
[31:57.810 --> 31:58.310]  Ultimate speed!
[31:58.850 --> 32:00.210]  The raccoon dropped his fartbag.
[32:00.390 --> 32:01.950]  Raccoon, raccoon, raccoon, raccoon.
[32:02.230 --> 32:03.530]  Eric won, god damn it!
[32:03.650 --> 32:03.750]  Ultimate speed.
[32:04.230 --> 32:07.010]  No, no, no, no, no!
[32:07.010 --> 32:07.130]  No!
[32:09.170 --> 32:09.610]  Okay.
[32:12.450 --> 32:13.530]  Ultimate speed, ultimate speed!
[32:14.270 --> 32:14.710]  Yeah!
[32:16.090 --> 32:17.430]  Die, bitch, die!
[32:17.470 --> 32:19.830]  God damn it, god damn it, god damn it.
[32:20.310 --> 32:21.850]  We gotta go back to the first one now.
[32:22.250 --> 32:22.890]  Okay, okay.
[32:24.250 --> 32:25.290]  Raccoon wins, that's right.
[32:25.430 --> 32:26.830]  Raccoon wins. That's right, baby.
[32:27.410 --> 32:29.550]  My title on the second one, I'm going for your first title.
[32:29.850 --> 32:30.270]  We're going back.
[32:31.390 --> 32:32.490]  You can't be a champ champ.
[32:34.530 --> 32:35.830]  The more we play this,
[32:35.910 --> 32:38.110]  the deeper we get into it, the more I really like it.
[32:39.530 --> 32:41.510]  Yeah, there's definitely a learning curve.
[32:41.930 --> 32:42.070]  Yeah.
[32:45.990 --> 32:47.430]  Okay, let's just put this
[32:47.430 --> 32:48.350]  right there.
[32:48.930 --> 32:51.570]  Oh, that'll be interesting for whoever
[32:51.570 --> 32:52.410]  lands there.
[32:53.230 --> 32:54.550]  Oh, that chicken.
[32:55.890 --> 32:57.290]  I mean, that's just some good,
[32:57.330 --> 32:58.750]  that's just a good rail, if you want.
[32:58.750 --> 32:59.370]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[33:00.130 --> 33:01.670]  And it's A to slide the rail?
[33:02.150 --> 33:02.350]  Yeah.
[33:03.510 --> 33:04.110]  No!
[33:06.850 --> 33:07.570]  God damn!
[33:08.770 --> 33:09.690]  We suck!
[33:09.910 --> 33:11.190]  We are so bad!
[33:13.290 --> 33:14.730]  What is that?
[33:16.530 --> 33:17.570]  What's this?
[33:20.890 --> 33:22.230]  Oh, god damn, what a piss.
[33:25.350 --> 33:26.350]  That'll be your savior.
[33:27.550 --> 33:28.410]  Oh, I'm dead.
[33:28.950 --> 33:30.790]  I'm going for the rail.
[33:31.050 --> 33:31.470]  I need ultimate speed.
[33:35.690 --> 33:36.210]  Nope.
[33:36.250 --> 33:36.610]  There we go.
[33:38.130 --> 33:39.070]  There's a trick!
[33:39.490 --> 33:40.630]  God damn, it's a raccoon!
[33:41.550 --> 33:42.330]  There's a trick.
[33:43.570 --> 33:44.410]  Raccoon!
[33:44.410 --> 33:45.570]  Wins again!
[33:46.190 --> 33:47.850]  Raccoon wins again!
[33:52.090 --> 33:54.470]  We love this. Everyone loves this.
[33:54.850 --> 33:57.050]  Where is ultimate speed?
[33:57.170 --> 33:58.170]  None of these is ultimate speed.
[34:00.070 --> 34:01.630]  None of these is death.
[34:03.590 --> 34:04.430]  Backflip!
[34:04.910 --> 34:05.770]  Double backflip!
[34:07.650 --> 34:09.330]  Double backflip!
[34:09.770 --> 34:10.590]  Raccoon trick!
[34:10.590 --> 34:10.810]  Raccoon trick!
[34:12.130 --> 34:13.650]  Come and get me, sheepy bitch!
[34:14.550 --> 34:16.090]  I mean, that's unnecessary.
[34:16.330 --> 34:17.150]  I'm just doing a little trick.
[34:17.590 --> 34:18.450]  Doing a little dance.
[34:19.550 --> 34:20.610]  I got no problem with you, raccoon.
[34:21.090 --> 34:23.230]  That's what you think. You better have a problem with me.
[34:23.450 --> 34:24.310]  Eat my fucking dust.
[34:27.950 --> 34:29.410]  Better start having a problem with me.
[34:29.610 --> 34:31.450]  We're going to bury the raccoon deep, I think.
[34:32.290 --> 34:32.930]  What is this?
[34:33.230 --> 34:35.830]  Telling someone that you don't have a problem with them
[34:35.830 --> 34:38.030]  and their response being, that's what you think is so funny?
[34:38.950 --> 34:40.110]  It is what I think.
[34:41.670 --> 34:42.950]  We're about to get a problem.
[34:43.670 --> 34:44.730]  You will have one.
[34:44.910 --> 34:46.710]  Chicken, we're going to have problems if you put that there.
[34:46.930 --> 34:47.970]  That is crazy.
[34:48.330 --> 34:50.570]  Chicken, you're nuts.
[34:51.050 --> 34:52.370]  Can you believe it?
[34:52.490 --> 34:53.230]  Oh my god.
[34:58.150 --> 34:59.110]  Double backflip!
[34:59.610 --> 35:00.870]  It hit me so hard.
[35:03.110 --> 35:04.590]  No, you twat!
[35:04.590 --> 35:05.350]  Shit!
[35:06.010 --> 35:08.030]  Oh, raccoon trick.
[35:08.170 --> 35:09.150]  Double raccoon trick.
[35:09.650 --> 35:10.890]  Raccoon backflip.
[35:11.430 --> 35:14.070]  It says I'm alive, but where?
[35:14.350 --> 35:15.210]  You're dead, bitch.
[35:18.410 --> 35:19.250]  This is horrendous.
[35:19.570 --> 35:21.410]  Eric is a real problem on this level.
[35:22.570 --> 35:23.930]  Oh, so bad for you.
[35:29.060 --> 35:30.800]  Nick's going to finish this level once, maybe.
[35:31.860 --> 35:33.440]  Well, there's a few people who haven't.
[35:34.040 --> 35:35.340]  There's a few people?
[35:36.620 --> 35:36.900]  Heyo!
[35:39.460 --> 35:40.780]  The two people who lived in England.
[35:43.740 --> 35:45.480]  Alright, you guys want to see a double backflip at home?
[35:45.720 --> 35:47.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, raccoon double backflip.
[35:48.440 --> 35:48.720]  Woohoo!
[35:51.560 --> 35:52.120]  Triple backflip!
[35:53.860 --> 35:55.140]  Raccoon, another backflip.
[35:55.460 --> 35:57.280]  Oh, please let me live.
[35:57.300 --> 35:58.320]  Sheep, you can do it all day.
[35:59.820 --> 36:00.540]  Oh, there we go.
[36:00.540 --> 36:02.240]  The horse is going to do it once. Way to go, horsey.
[36:02.240 --> 36:03.000]  You idiot.
[36:03.880 --> 36:05.380]  Well, you made it through.
[36:07.840 --> 36:09.340]  Where are the tricks going to put me?
[36:10.740 --> 36:11.100]  What?
[36:13.400 --> 36:14.780]  Look at Nick's.
[36:15.020 --> 36:16.420]  He might as well have not finished.
[36:17.240 --> 36:18.900]  How did you get such a little win?
[36:19.420 --> 36:20.720]  It says post-mortem,
[36:20.800 --> 36:21.780]  but I was alive.
[36:22.440 --> 36:23.480]  Nah, you were dead.
[36:23.860 --> 36:26.040]  Guys, you are not ready for ultimate speed.
[36:26.420 --> 36:28.340]  If you're at home and you're ready for ultimate speed,
[36:28.440 --> 36:28.800]  let me know.
[36:29.940 --> 36:31.040]  Ultimate speed.
[36:31.980 --> 36:32.340]  Backflip.
[36:32.760 --> 36:33.480]  Double backflip.
[36:33.900 --> 36:35.640]  Oh my god, where's my bike?
[36:36.160 --> 36:37.120]  Oh god!
[36:39.900 --> 36:40.760]  That's a trick.
[36:41.600 --> 36:42.560]  That's a trick.
[36:43.580 --> 36:45.180]  Raccoon does it again.
[36:46.560 --> 36:47.260]  Unbeatable
[36:47.260 --> 36:48.120]  on this level.
[36:48.180 --> 36:48.540]  There we go.
[36:51.680 --> 36:52.380]  Unbeatable.
[36:54.780 --> 36:55.840]  Good tricks.
[36:55.840 --> 36:57.740]  How is your post-mortem
[36:57.740 --> 36:59.620]  higher than my post-mortem?
[36:59.720 --> 37:01.260]  It doesn't make any sense.
[37:01.640 --> 37:02.580]  Play this level again.
[37:02.880 --> 37:03.800]  Play this level again.
[37:05.760 --> 37:07.860]  Nick needs to figure out how to score
[37:07.860 --> 37:08.440]  on the farm.
[37:10.400 --> 37:10.920]  What?
[37:25.900 --> 37:26.420]  Alright.
[37:27.040 --> 37:28.240]  How do you grab the lamp?
[37:28.760 --> 37:30.860]  A. You jump and then you hit A again.
[37:33.780 --> 37:34.600]  Jump and A.
[37:34.600 --> 37:35.640]  I'm too low.
[37:35.720 --> 37:36.780]  Ultimate speed.
[37:38.580 --> 37:40.760]  Why is my swingy so
[37:40.760 --> 37:41.440]  little?
[37:42.340 --> 37:43.040]  Ultimate speed.
[37:46.200 --> 37:48.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, the raccoon
[37:48.540 --> 37:50.460]  does it again. Let me know in the chat how you're
[37:50.460 --> 37:52.240]  feeling. Oh no, post-mortem!
[37:55.760 --> 37:58.500]  I did it post-mortem. That might be bad.
[38:01.460 --> 38:02.700]  Oh, it's true.
[38:02.700 --> 38:04.760]  I killed myself and I got less points
[38:04.760 --> 38:05.980]  for it. Damn.
[38:06.500 --> 38:08.540]  I got a draggy little point.
[38:08.880 --> 38:10.920]  Yep. At least Nick figured it out.
[38:11.500 --> 38:12.640]  And, and Nick
[38:12.640 --> 38:13.440]  is also here.
[38:17.840 --> 38:19.440]  Oh, that's gonna be a coin.
[38:25.270 --> 38:26.670]  Where can I put
[38:26.670 --> 38:28.050]  this that I feel good about?
[38:28.470 --> 38:28.850]  What?
[38:31.390 --> 38:32.550]  How about like that?
[38:33.970 --> 38:35.570]  I like that after the beginning
[38:35.570 --> 38:36.730]  you're just hitting the clear.
[38:38.710 --> 38:39.850]  Oh, is mine behind?
[38:40.010 --> 38:40.530]  God damn it.
[38:42.350 --> 38:43.910]  Oh. Oh, the sheep.
[38:43.990 --> 38:45.650]  The bastard sheep. Come on.
[38:46.030 --> 38:47.630]  No, it just plumbed my
[38:47.630 --> 38:49.970]  face back. No, the game fucked me.
[38:50.110 --> 38:51.830]  Let me grab this coin. Let me grab...
[38:51.830 --> 38:53.650]  How did you not die? We were in the same
[38:53.650 --> 38:55.430]  place. How come I can't grab the coin?
[38:56.170 --> 38:56.870]  It's not your coin.
[38:57.550 --> 38:58.830]  But he dropped it.
[38:59.250 --> 39:00.110]  No, it's not for you.
[39:01.410 --> 39:02.890]  It's not for you.
[39:03.210 --> 39:04.990]  Spring. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[39:06.330 --> 39:07.070]  No, no, no.
[39:07.090 --> 39:08.910]  I don't have time. I don't have time for this.
[39:09.250 --> 39:09.510]  Yeah!
[39:10.390 --> 39:10.830]  Yeah!
[39:13.930 --> 39:14.990]  God damn it.
[39:16.530 --> 39:17.930]  Bitch ass raccoon.
[39:20.030 --> 39:22.170]  Talk to me once you finish. Oh, ladies
[39:22.170 --> 39:24.050]  and gentlemen, if you're just joining us,
[39:24.070 --> 39:25.670]  you are about to see ultimate speed.
[39:28.970 --> 39:29.730]  Ultimate speed!
[39:30.250 --> 39:31.350]  Go, go, go, go.
[39:31.750 --> 39:33.350]  Come on, come on. No, no!
[39:34.310 --> 39:35.130]  Come on. No!
[39:36.230 --> 39:38.170]  Oh, shit. Oh, my God. He's gonna do it.
[39:38.450 --> 39:39.730]  Oh, my God. Nick's gonna do it.
[39:39.930 --> 39:42.030]  They said it is impossible. There's nothing that can
[39:42.030 --> 39:44.190]  stop him but him. Yeah!
[39:44.770 --> 39:45.090]  Yeah!
[39:46.290 --> 39:47.690]  Nick finally got one, guys.
[39:48.650 --> 39:49.450]  Yeah. Oh!
[39:49.510 --> 39:50.830]  Wow, he took over first.
[39:52.330 --> 39:54.390]  Gabbin' all the way to the bottom.
[39:55.110 --> 39:55.130]  Hey!
[39:55.130 --> 39:55.330]  Hey!
[39:56.870 --> 39:57.550]  Hey!
[39:59.090 --> 40:00.970]  The chat goes crazy.
[40:01.210 --> 40:02.950]  Yeah, that's because it's pathetic.
[40:03.170 --> 40:03.610]  Hey!
[40:04.690 --> 40:05.290]  Give me the TV.
[40:10.720 --> 40:12.080]  Oh, my God.
[40:12.420 --> 40:12.920]  Horse.
[40:13.620 --> 40:14.300]  Horse.
[40:17.320 --> 40:18.440]  I will hold
[40:18.440 --> 40:19.700]  my... Oh, this is bad.
[40:22.540 --> 40:23.400]  Sneak through.
[40:23.940 --> 40:24.540]  No!
[40:24.540 --> 40:24.660]  Oh!
[40:26.200 --> 40:27.260]  He's got the coin.
[40:28.180 --> 40:30.560]  Nobody's got the coin. Oh, no, Raccoon's gonna die.
[40:31.060 --> 40:32.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, Raccoon's gonna die.
[40:33.920 --> 40:34.660]  Oh, no.
[40:35.180 --> 40:35.800]  Oh, my God.
[40:36.400 --> 40:38.660]  Horse toast. There goes Sheep. Sheep is taking over.
[40:38.900 --> 40:40.780]  Captain Curry, five gifted subs.
[40:42.080 --> 40:42.280]  Tricks.
[40:42.280 --> 40:43.100]  He's looking for tricks.
[40:44.240 --> 40:45.180]  You idiot.
[40:46.500 --> 40:46.980]  Backflip.
[40:47.580 --> 40:49.400]  He's got 20 more seconds of tricks to do.
[40:50.100 --> 40:52.300]  Right here. Right here.
[40:52.300 --> 40:54.480]  Oh, you're a little...
[40:54.480 --> 40:55.000]  Tony Hawk.
[40:57.060 --> 40:58.160]  BMX style, baby.
[40:58.560 --> 40:59.540]  BMX style.
[41:00.380 --> 41:01.700]  He's gonna get post-mortem.
[41:02.020 --> 41:03.560]  He's gonna get post-mortem.
[41:05.620 --> 41:06.180]  Bullshit!
[41:06.440 --> 41:07.860]  Look at that trick.
[41:08.320 --> 41:10.280]  Captain Curry with five gifted subs.
[41:10.420 --> 41:12.080]  Thanks. Thank you so much.
[41:14.720 --> 41:16.480]  I'm gonna need to win with coins now.
[41:17.100 --> 41:17.720]  Yeah, I hear that.
[41:23.310 --> 41:24.070]  There we go.
[41:24.290 --> 41:24.650]  There we go.
[41:24.650 --> 41:26.570]  I still have never been able to activate the...
[41:26.570 --> 41:27.850]  How are you supposed to do...
[41:28.670 --> 41:29.030]  Andrew.
[41:31.450 --> 41:33.110]  I'm tapping in my Gavin roots.
[41:33.250 --> 41:34.230]  We're just fucking up the speed.
[41:36.090 --> 41:36.610]  I'm trying...
[41:36.610 --> 41:38.490]  I was trying to get through so Gavin couldn't get through.
[41:39.690 --> 41:40.050]  Oh!
[41:42.870 --> 41:44.390]  There we go. Bike it through. Bike it through.
[41:44.550 --> 41:46.790]  Go. Go, bike, go. Go, bike, go.
[41:47.730 --> 41:48.090]  No!
[41:48.090 --> 41:48.350]  No!
[41:50.590 --> 41:51.090]  Wow.
[41:52.310 --> 41:53.730]  Oh, you had such a lead.
[41:53.870 --> 41:54.230]  Incredible.
[41:56.150 --> 41:57.870]  Give it to me. Give me the points.
[41:58.590 --> 41:59.390]  Keep them down.
[41:59.630 --> 42:00.130]  No!
[42:01.150 --> 42:02.910]  Raccoon is pulling up the real...
[42:02.910 --> 42:04.510]  They said it couldn't be done.
[42:08.850 --> 42:09.350]  Oh.
[42:09.630 --> 42:11.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness ultimate speed.
[42:15.920 --> 42:16.640]  Ultimate speed!
[42:16.640 --> 42:17.500]  Oh, shit.
[42:18.460 --> 42:19.520]  Ultimate speed!
[42:19.820 --> 42:20.680]  Oh, I'm through.
[42:22.200 --> 42:23.240]  I want to play.
[42:24.320 --> 42:26.440]  Ultimate speed. Ultimate trick.
[42:26.820 --> 42:27.320]  Raccoon, go.
[42:27.560 --> 42:29.220]  No, the sheep.
[42:37.540 --> 42:40.180]  Stop. Stop. Stop.
[42:41.140 --> 42:41.860]  Idiot.
[42:43.640 --> 42:44.620]  Trick points.
[42:45.760 --> 42:46.540]  Let's see.
[42:49.660 --> 42:51.000]  Oh, that's a lot of tricks.
[42:51.180 --> 42:51.900]  Big style.
[42:52.120 --> 42:54.360]  Look at that horse bringing up the real
[42:54.360 --> 42:55.740]  because the horse sucks.
[42:56.900 --> 42:57.420]  Dethroned.
[43:09.680 --> 43:10.880]  There we go.
[43:12.380 --> 43:13.600]  Now we're talking.
[43:14.080 --> 43:14.780]  There you go, horse.
[43:15.740 --> 43:16.560]  That's a nightmare.
[43:17.600 --> 43:19.000]  I like that trash can.
[43:20.220 --> 43:22.160]  Not as much as I like the trash can.
[43:22.720 --> 43:23.380]  Ultimate speed!
[43:24.640 --> 43:25.180]  Oh, no.
[43:26.360 --> 43:26.960]  No, no, no.
[43:29.280 --> 43:30.080]  Ultimate speed.
[43:30.820 --> 43:32.100]  Hop. No, hop the wrong way.
[43:32.220 --> 43:33.340]  No, no, no.
[43:33.680 --> 43:35.440]  Come on, raccoon.
[43:37.480 --> 43:38.260]  Raccoon, no.
[43:38.900 --> 43:40.260]  No, raccoon, no.
[43:41.020 --> 43:41.740]  Oh, shit!
[43:41.740 --> 43:42.480]  The horse.
[43:45.360 --> 43:48.080]  I can't believe I did that.
[43:48.520 --> 43:49.240]  I...
[43:49.240 --> 43:49.840]  Sheep.
[43:50.420 --> 43:51.440]  Come on.
[43:52.780 --> 43:53.580]  Wow.
[43:55.440 --> 43:56.840]  Where's my post-mortem?
[43:59.140 --> 44:00.560]  It didn't give it to me.
[44:00.580 --> 44:01.480]  You didn't get through?
[44:02.060 --> 44:02.700]  No.
[44:03.240 --> 44:05.980]  I was through.
[44:06.140 --> 44:07.660]  You all saw it.
[44:09.480 --> 44:11.180]  We're in a Donkey Kong, this thing.
[44:20.450 --> 44:21.850]  Get in the barrel, get in the barrel.
[44:22.150 --> 44:22.450]  Fuck.
[44:23.650 --> 44:24.710]  No, my bike.
[44:25.190 --> 44:26.530]  No, my bike.
[44:27.250 --> 44:28.350]  Give me that.
[44:28.450 --> 44:28.890]  No!
[44:30.850 --> 44:32.790]  I'm getting annihilated.
[44:33.330 --> 44:34.690]  Where am I?
[44:35.850 --> 44:37.370]  I'm in hell.
[44:38.970 --> 44:40.190]  The horse killed me.
[44:40.690 --> 44:43.750]  Oh, the drinks with the umbrella.
[44:44.230 --> 44:44.750]  Wow.
[44:44.790 --> 44:46.290]  That was real cool.
[44:46.750 --> 44:49.190]  Thank you.
[44:51.210 --> 44:51.950]  Whoa!
[44:52.570 --> 44:54.070]  Up to third place.
[44:54.330 --> 44:55.850]  Almost second place.
[44:56.630 --> 44:57.330]  Bullshit.
[44:58.190 --> 44:59.190]  No, it's right.
[44:59.950 --> 45:01.290]  No, it's right.
[45:03.150 --> 45:04.890]  There we go.
[45:05.430 --> 45:06.250]  Ace of spades.
[45:06.490 --> 45:06.950]  What does that do?
[45:06.950 --> 45:08.010]  No idea.
[45:08.730 --> 45:09.910]  The ace of spades.
[45:10.430 --> 45:10.730]  Shit.
[45:12.250 --> 45:12.990]  Come on.
[45:14.530 --> 45:15.010]  Come on.
[45:16.710 --> 45:18.510]  Raccoon, where are you?
[45:18.770 --> 45:19.810]  No, raccoon, no.
[45:20.870 --> 45:22.130]  Tricks, Nick, tricks.
[45:23.090 --> 45:23.930]  Nick, you fool.
[45:24.710 --> 45:25.310]  Stop.
[45:25.790 --> 45:27.690]  Tricks, tricks, tricks.
[45:28.470 --> 45:29.590]  No, stop doing tricks.
[45:30.350 --> 45:31.390]  You have a lot of time.
[45:31.890 --> 45:35.170]  Go back and hit more tricks.
[45:35.170 --> 45:36.330]  Nick, you dummy.
[45:43.130 --> 45:45.390]  Did you get post-mortem again?
[45:45.770 --> 45:47.330]  You numbskull.
[45:48.770 --> 45:50.970]  You got almost as many points in tricks.
[45:56.950 --> 45:59.110]  That was some hubris gone wrong.
[45:59.530 --> 46:01.530]  I cannot get through this first part again.
[46:01.650 --> 46:02.370]  I'm done.
[46:02.370 --> 46:03.830]  I'm so toast.
[46:03.950 --> 46:05.470]  No, don't put that there.
[46:05.530 --> 46:06.770]  You've boned us.
[46:06.830 --> 46:10.190]  Whoever put the circle dealie.
[46:10.250 --> 46:10.890]  That was me.
[46:12.190 --> 46:14.290]  Oh shit, I went straight into the other one.
[46:15.750 --> 46:18.170]  Oh, why didn't it grab me? It did.
[46:18.770 --> 46:19.190]  Yes, go.
[46:19.730 --> 46:20.370]  Raccoon, go.
[46:21.510 --> 46:23.010]  Go, raccoon, go.
[46:25.910 --> 46:26.950]  Raccoon, please.
[46:26.950 --> 46:27.090]  No.
[46:29.010 --> 46:29.930]  Tricks, tricks, tricks.
[46:31.110 --> 46:31.350]  No.
[46:33.170 --> 46:34.750]  He might have done it.
[46:36.190 --> 46:38.670]  I am the horse.
[46:39.850 --> 46:40.350]  No.
[46:41.770 --> 46:41.990]  No.
[46:44.430 --> 46:46.590]  And you said I couldn't do it.
[46:47.890 --> 46:48.770]  But here I am.
[46:49.130 --> 46:49.750]  He won.
[46:51.150 --> 46:51.810]  Bullshit.
[46:52.410 --> 46:53.590]  Here I am.
[46:53.590 --> 46:55.710]  Horse in the round, fellas.
[46:58.030 --> 46:59.250]  I can't wait for this full game.
[47:00.030 --> 47:01.730]  I can't wait for us to play this
[47:01.730 --> 47:03.330]  again when it comes out and
[47:03.330 --> 47:05.550]  Geoff just having such an advantage over
[47:05.550 --> 47:06.050]  these two levels.
[47:07.350 --> 47:09.370]  He's not going to know anything about ultimate speed.
[47:09.750 --> 47:11.390]  This game is hard as shit.
[47:11.650 --> 47:13.150]  This game is so...
[47:13.150 --> 47:15.670]  At the beginning, you're like, oh, we're just cruising in.
[47:15.710 --> 47:17.450]  No problem. When stuff starts
[47:17.450 --> 47:19.530]  getting stacked, it's so fucked.
[47:20.270 --> 47:20.870]  It's fucked.
[47:23.590 --> 47:24.110]  Good luck.
[47:24.650 --> 47:26.210]  I cannot believe the horse won.
[47:27.450 --> 47:28.210]  I believe it.
[47:28.350 --> 47:29.530]  Oh, that's insane, Gavin.
[47:30.110 --> 47:31.270]  It might be the move, though.
[47:32.190 --> 47:33.810]  Oh, I gotta go forward. I'm in the front.
[47:37.210 --> 47:37.870]  You're an idiot.
[47:38.590 --> 47:39.430]  Yeah, you guys are dumb.
[47:40.970 --> 47:41.650]  I lived.
[47:43.650 --> 47:44.330]  Oh, god.
[47:45.030 --> 47:46.770]  No, no, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike.
[47:48.650 --> 47:50.550]  Well, what are you supposed to do there?
[47:56.070 --> 47:56.510]  The
[47:56.510 --> 47:57.610]  one time I make it past
[47:57.610 --> 47:59.150]  the first six feet of a level is
[47:59.150 --> 48:00.350]  completely impossible.
[48:05.010 --> 48:05.450]  Alright.
[48:05.870 --> 48:07.310]  See if you can make it.
[48:10.050 --> 48:11.650]  Hey, Gavin, what good does that do
[48:11.650 --> 48:13.010]  there? I love it.
[48:13.650 --> 48:15.170]  I want it where there's good.
[48:15.730 --> 48:16.470]  Wait, where's the bad?
[48:16.550 --> 48:18.690]  I want it where there's good.
[48:19.070 --> 48:19.990]  Where's the bad?
[48:25.820 --> 48:27.700]  Oh, we all learned our lesson about the
[48:28.440 --> 48:29.360]  trash can.
[48:29.440 --> 48:30.580]  Bye, horse.
[48:31.120 --> 48:32.280]  Bye, horse, you idiot.
[48:32.660 --> 48:32.860]  No!
[48:34.920 --> 48:37.060]  No, no, no, no.
[48:37.920 --> 48:39.420]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[48:39.780 --> 48:41.760]  Cheater, cheater,
[48:41.900 --> 48:42.300]  sheep.
[48:42.680 --> 48:45.140]  On my screen, you just cheated.
[48:45.440 --> 48:46.520]  No, no, no, no.
[48:47.020 --> 48:48.420]  Yes, there you go, you little cheater.
[48:48.740 --> 48:49.940]  You cheated again.
[48:50.500 --> 48:52.060]  Cheater sheep, you little cheater.
[48:52.060 --> 48:54.080]  How are you going straight up the wall?
[48:54.500 --> 48:56.380]  You just jam on the A button
[48:56.380 --> 48:57.440]  that gets you there.
[48:58.900 --> 49:00.200]  What do you mean you mash A?
[49:00.660 --> 49:02.260]  I think that was pretty self explanatory.
[49:03.240 --> 49:04.320]  Right, but you...
[49:06.240 --> 49:07.320]  Why's my wheel come off?
[49:07.640 --> 49:09.860]  I got one wheel. No, no, you're good, it's just a glitch.
[49:09.860 --> 49:11.140]  Oh, it just got stuck in itself.
[49:11.640 --> 49:13.620]  No, no, no, no, no.
[49:14.780 --> 49:15.800]  Mash A. Oh my god.
[49:16.040 --> 49:17.560]  Mash A, what are you talking about?
[49:17.960 --> 49:18.940]  There you go. No!
[49:19.560 --> 49:20.360]  There you go.
[49:20.360 --> 49:21.160]  Cheating horse.
[49:23.380 --> 49:25.120]  The horse doesn't even know how to cheat.
[49:28.780 --> 49:30.060]  Zero points still.
[49:34.230 --> 49:34.590]  Alright.
[49:35.290 --> 49:36.150]  I know what'll help.
[49:36.330 --> 49:37.150]  I want good.
[49:45.670 --> 49:46.710]  Go for it, go for it, Gavin.
[49:47.490 --> 49:48.350]  Everyone go right.
[49:51.070 --> 49:52.890]  Oh, Gavin, tricky, tricky.
[49:53.290 --> 49:54.490]  What the... Bye horse.
[49:55.170 --> 49:56.750]  What a worthless shit.
[49:57.690 --> 49:58.370]  Uh oh.
[49:58.590 --> 49:58.970]  There we go.
[50:00.030 --> 50:00.990]  There we go.
[50:02.050 --> 50:03.070]  Bye raccoon.
[50:03.290 --> 50:05.510]  There goes the raccoon baby.
[50:05.990 --> 50:07.830]  The sheep rules too.
[50:08.070 --> 50:09.690]  Everybody, notice the sheep too.
[50:09.770 --> 50:11.070]  Sheep also rules.
[50:11.910 --> 50:13.450]  Oh, I think you missed the end.
[50:14.910 --> 50:16.750]  The sheep also rules.
[50:17.510 --> 50:18.370]  Don't forget the sheep.
[50:18.610 --> 50:19.950]  The sheep's back here too.
[50:20.470 --> 50:21.930]  In seconds, see the sheep.
[50:21.930 --> 50:23.330]  Where's the horse?
[50:24.730 --> 50:25.730]  He's dead as dick.
[50:36.670 --> 50:39.030]  I can't see. Me neither.
[50:39.950 --> 50:40.450]  It's Nick's fault.
[50:43.470 --> 50:44.690]  Now you can.
[50:45.090 --> 50:46.350]  Oh, I missed it.
[50:49.370 --> 50:51.130]  I'm making a Donkey Kong track.
[50:53.930 --> 50:54.890]  Bye boys.
[50:55.750 --> 50:56.990]  Oh, go down.
[50:58.250 --> 50:59.250]  Come on.
[50:59.330 --> 51:00.330]  Okay, we're okay.
[51:00.830 --> 51:03.190]  No, no, no, no.
[51:03.190 --> 51:04.510]  Recover, recover.
[51:04.910 --> 51:06.150]  That's bullshit.
[51:06.870 --> 51:08.310]  Little cheater sheep.
[51:08.510 --> 51:11.030]  Little cheater sheep.
[51:11.350 --> 51:12.310]  Sheep has to cheat.
[51:12.470 --> 51:13.130]  Sheep, sheep, sheep.
[51:14.990 --> 51:15.630]  Bullshit.
[51:16.250 --> 51:17.790]  Why did you put it there?
[51:17.790 --> 51:19.350]  Why wouldn't you put it at the start of the- doesn't matter.
[51:20.270 --> 51:21.470]  Little cheater sheep had to get in there.
[51:21.550 --> 51:22.010]  He's a little cheater.
[51:23.210 --> 51:24.250]  He's a little cheater sheep.
[51:25.150 --> 51:27.550]  I don't like that the screen kills me all the time.
[51:28.410 --> 51:29.710]  Maybe you shouldn't be focusing
[51:29.710 --> 51:31.030]  on your Donkey Kong track.
[51:31.250 --> 51:34.250]  Yeah, but imagine it. Imagine it at its full potential.
[51:35.370 --> 51:35.570]  Okay.
[51:35.710 --> 51:36.010]  Here we go, boys.
[51:37.430 --> 51:38.570]  Imagine finishing the level.
[51:39.370 --> 51:40.030]  Ultimate speed!
[51:42.630 --> 51:43.570]  Okay, we're okay.
[51:43.810 --> 51:44.090]  Get under.
[51:44.090 --> 51:45.110]  Trap!
[51:46.930 --> 51:47.590]  No, no!
[51:48.490 --> 51:49.410]  Come on!
[51:49.410 --> 51:50.270]  No, no, no!
[51:51.190 --> 51:52.930]  I don't know how to do it.
[51:53.910 --> 51:54.350]  What?
[51:56.690 --> 51:58.130]  This is like Super Meat Boy.
[51:59.050 --> 51:59.310]  Yeah?
[51:59.750 --> 52:01.210]  Slide and jump, slide and jump.
[52:03.950 --> 52:04.870]  We're on bikes.
[52:07.210 --> 52:13.020]  I have to prevent.
[52:14.640 --> 52:15.460]  There you go.
[52:15.460 --> 52:16.820]  Other way.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.400]  What the fuck is it doing?
[52:19.980 --> 52:22.240]  Gavin is so determined.
[52:23.740 --> 52:27.060]  I really wanted for you at this point.
[52:28.400 --> 52:29.160]  Ultimate speed!
[52:30.180 --> 52:31.480]  I've angled it wrong.
[52:33.420 --> 52:34.020]  No!
[52:35.180 --> 52:35.940]  That's my coin!
[52:36.480 --> 52:37.820]  This is the worst!
[52:38.100 --> 52:39.940]  I had plans for that coin.
[52:40.240 --> 52:41.520]  My bike went through!
[52:42.780 --> 52:44.480]  Raccoon's in with the tricks, baby!
[52:45.740 --> 52:47.000]  Come on, dumbass chicken.
[52:47.340 --> 52:48.100]  Stupid-ass bird.
[52:48.440 --> 52:49.220]  Little bitch bird.
[52:49.580 --> 52:51.820]  What are you going to do?
[52:52.100 --> 52:53.160]  What are you going to do, little bird bitch?
[52:53.300 --> 52:53.740]  What are you going to do?
[52:54.280 --> 52:56.220]  Figure it out, little bitch bird.
[52:56.340 --> 52:56.880]  Do something.
[52:58.440 --> 52:59.360]  What did you just do?
[53:11.520 --> 53:12.540]  What does it do?
[53:17.380 --> 53:18.960]  What does the car do?
[53:21.360 --> 53:23.300]  You're so close to finishing.
[53:23.880 --> 53:27.200]  That might be the best moment of any gameplay we've ever done.
[53:27.700 --> 53:28.620]  What does the car do?
[53:28.860 --> 53:30.320]  What does the car do?
[53:30.720 --> 53:32.680]  Gavin just got scared and shit.
[53:34.620 --> 53:36.020]  What does the car do?
[53:36.120 --> 53:37.600]  Then he gooed himself to the floor.
[53:42.220 --> 53:43.800]  In the chat.
[53:44.020 --> 53:45.480]  That was straight bullying.
[53:45.760 --> 53:46.260]  Absolutely.
[53:49.380 --> 53:49.980]  Yes!
[53:52.600 --> 53:53.680]  You're a maniac.
[53:54.020 --> 53:54.660]  I love this.
[53:55.820 --> 53:58.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ultimate speed.
[53:58.980 --> 53:59.580]  Ultimate speed!
[54:00.300 --> 54:00.580]  No!
[54:00.980 --> 54:01.240]  Yes!
[54:03.880 --> 54:05.700]  I missed the coin!
[54:05.860 --> 54:06.580]  I missed the coin!
[54:07.240 --> 54:08.580]  Oh, come on.
[54:08.580 --> 54:10.040]  No, no, no, I'm still in it.
[54:10.160 --> 54:10.460]  Come on.
[54:11.720 --> 54:13.440]  No, no, no, no!
[54:14.340 --> 54:15.000]  My coins!
[54:15.600 --> 54:16.500]  Not the horse.
[54:17.860 --> 54:19.380]  Anything but the horse.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.060]  Why do you have the coin?
[54:27.120 --> 54:28.620]  Oh, it's available.
[54:29.100 --> 54:29.880]  The coin's available.
[54:32.180 --> 54:32.980]  Gavin stole it.
[54:34.300 --> 54:34.860]  Flap!
[54:36.580 --> 54:37.720]  I'm going to flap!
[54:38.480 --> 54:40.880]  No, no, no!
[54:42.120 --> 54:43.120]  Son of a bitch.
[54:44.580 --> 54:47.080]  Alright, dumb donkey, go for it.
[54:47.320 --> 54:48.540]  Go, donkey, go!
[54:56.440 --> 54:59.260]  This has been the least successful we've ever been.
[54:59.500 --> 55:00.840]  We had like two good rounds.
[55:01.680 --> 55:02.240]  Oh my god.
[55:02.240 --> 55:04.360]  Oh, double ultimate speed? You fucking got it.
[55:05.860 --> 55:08.700]  I cannot wait to play this with Geoff. He's not going to know what the fuck to do.
[55:09.600 --> 55:10.060]  Shit!
[55:10.400 --> 55:10.920]  Ultimate speed!
[55:12.640 --> 55:13.240]  Ultimate speed!
[55:15.840 --> 55:17.100]  Yes, I made it!
[55:17.320 --> 55:18.360]  Where am I?
[55:19.540 --> 55:21.840]  No, no, no!
[55:22.860 --> 55:24.140]  Yes, yes, yes!
[55:24.940 --> 55:25.820]  Go, Gavin!
[55:28.340 --> 55:29.460]  Son of a bitch.
[55:29.460 --> 55:30.640]  Go, Gavin, go!
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.520]  The coin got stuck up there.
[55:32.660 --> 55:33.600]  Just go!
[55:33.660 --> 55:36.060]  I need the coin!
[55:36.360 --> 55:38.640]  God damn it.
[55:39.180 --> 55:41.800]  You're just like teeter-tottering the camera.
[55:44.900 --> 55:45.900]  Oh, it's a raccoon.
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.280]  Look at the raccoon trying to get to the finish.
[55:52.540 --> 55:54.020]  Here we go, here we go.
[55:55.220 --> 55:56.760]  Come on, hit me!
[55:56.760 --> 55:57.080]  No!
[55:57.700 --> 55:58.340]  Yeah!
[55:59.940 --> 56:02.480]  He's going to get the coin.
[56:03.400 --> 56:05.460]  I have to beat the level.
[56:06.060 --> 56:07.080]  And now, here we go!
[56:07.940 --> 56:08.560]  Ultimate speed!
[56:09.480 --> 56:10.200]  Stop him!
[56:11.960 --> 56:12.180]  Yeah!
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.460]  What a disaster.
[56:15.620 --> 56:17.200]  What a disaster.
[56:19.220 --> 56:22.340]  I need big payoffs here, big wins.
[56:22.900 --> 56:24.960]  I'm sweating so bad.
[56:28.080 --> 56:28.600]  Alright.
[56:28.720 --> 56:30.620]  Where's my area of displeasure?
[56:36.860 --> 56:38.860]  This music makes me crazy.
[56:39.060 --> 56:40.420]  This music is making me insane.
[56:40.660 --> 56:42.400]  Are you...
[56:43.620 --> 56:44.140]  Alright.
[56:44.660 --> 56:45.420]  Yeah, whatever.
[56:45.840 --> 56:47.060]  You know what?
[56:48.460 --> 56:50.220]  There's so many coins on the field.
[56:50.560 --> 56:53.720]  I have to keep ultimate speed.
[56:53.900 --> 56:54.640]  I have to keep it.
[56:54.640 --> 56:55.160]  Here we go.
[56:56.620 --> 56:57.980]  I'm the honey shitter.
[56:58.300 --> 56:58.460]  No!
[57:00.600 --> 57:02.120]  Raccoon, where are you?
[57:02.280 --> 57:03.620]  Here we go.
[57:04.920 --> 57:05.560]  No!
[57:07.080 --> 57:07.900]  Come on!
[57:09.140 --> 57:10.540]  Go at the wall!
[57:10.660 --> 57:11.600]  Go at the wall!
[57:12.360 --> 57:14.300]  Is it enough?
[57:14.700 --> 57:15.960]  No, he has the coin!
[57:16.600 --> 57:17.420]  Coin me!
[57:18.080 --> 57:18.580]  Coin me!
[57:19.980 --> 57:22.500]  Die, you dumb animals!
[57:22.500 --> 57:23.020]  Woohoo!
[57:24.500 --> 57:26.500]  You stupid animals, die!
[57:28.060 --> 57:30.440]  Oh, the raccoon tried to car wheel to steal it.
[57:31.920 --> 57:32.400]  No!
[57:33.160 --> 57:34.880]  Oh, he goes too aggressive.
[57:36.040 --> 57:38.400]  Alright, Gavin, 30 seconds to figure it out.
[57:38.600 --> 57:39.700]  What are you doing?
[57:40.700 --> 57:42.260]  I was trying to get the second coin.
[57:42.700 --> 57:43.580]  I'm not gonna win the coin.
[57:44.260 --> 57:44.800]  Is it enough?
[57:45.540 --> 57:46.880]  Can I take the lead?
[57:47.980 --> 57:48.460]  No.
[57:48.460 --> 57:49.120]  Yeah!
[57:49.700 --> 57:50.420]  Yeah!
[57:51.980 --> 57:52.700]  Yeah!
[57:55.360 --> 57:57.220]  On the last turn!
[57:57.700 --> 57:58.040]  No!
[57:58.780 --> 57:59.120]  Yeah!
[58:01.320 --> 58:02.660]  What the fuck?
[58:06.180 --> 58:08.080]  Gavin cannot wait to get back into this.
[58:09.320 --> 58:10.420]  I'm gonna win.
[58:10.900 --> 58:11.420]  You're not gonna.
[58:12.040 --> 58:12.960]  Shut up!
[58:14.540 --> 58:16.420]  Has everybody won except for you?
[58:16.420 --> 58:16.840]  Yeah.
[58:17.400 --> 58:20.420]  Guys, we're getting so close to 5-0-1.
[58:20.760 --> 58:22.220]  Thank you so much for being here.
[58:22.320 --> 58:22.960]  This is great.
[58:23.760 --> 58:26.240]  This game is Ultimate Sheep Raccoon
[58:26.240 --> 58:27.520]  and it's fun as shit.
[58:28.260 --> 58:29.540]  That's the spot for it.
[58:29.600 --> 58:30.180]  There you go.
[58:31.940 --> 58:33.600]  This is the evolution of Chicken Do.
[58:33.700 --> 58:34.480]  Welcome to it.
[58:34.940 --> 58:35.760]  That looks promising.
[58:39.920 --> 58:41.400]  That's lovely, that is.
[58:41.660 --> 58:42.280]  There's a trick.
[58:42.280 --> 58:42.960]  Trick.
[58:44.360 --> 58:44.880]  Okay.
[58:46.340 --> 58:46.980]  Trick.
[58:47.500 --> 58:48.140]  No!
[58:48.440 --> 58:48.620]  No!
[58:51.620 --> 58:53.120]  Not the horse!
[58:54.640 --> 58:56.080]  Not the lowly horse!
[58:56.500 --> 58:57.360]  Stop him!
[58:58.680 --> 59:00.540]  Hoisted by his own petard.
[59:00.960 --> 59:01.580]  Here we go!
[59:01.700 --> 59:02.480]  Why is the sheep alive?
[59:03.140 --> 59:04.580]  Wait, I'm alive?
[59:04.900 --> 59:05.280]  Yeah!
[59:08.920 --> 59:10.400]  Where am I?
[59:10.400 --> 59:11.780]  You're under the map!
[59:13.780 --> 59:14.420]  Trick!
[59:14.740 --> 59:14.900]  Trick!
[59:15.180 --> 59:15.400]  Trick!
[59:18.560 --> 59:19.800]  Do a little trick!
[59:20.140 --> 59:21.940]  He's just stuck for 30 seconds!
[59:22.180 --> 59:22.860]  Do a little trick!
[59:23.760 --> 59:24.660]  He's almost up!
[59:26.120 --> 59:26.760]  Trick!
[59:29.720 --> 59:30.740]  He's toast.
[59:31.200 --> 59:32.520]  Switch to turbo controller.
[59:32.520 --> 59:32.980]  Hahaha!
[59:34.900 --> 59:35.720]  Woo!
[59:36.140 --> 59:36.580]  Woo!
[59:38.360 --> 59:40.100]  Way to go, Andrew!
[59:40.600 --> 59:41.140]  Yep!
[59:42.080 --> 59:42.540]  Yeah!
[59:46.300 --> 59:47.540]  Oh, man.
[59:48.060 --> 59:50.320]  My own trap almost got me.
[59:50.840 --> 59:51.380]  Oh, give me that.
[59:52.640 --> 59:55.440]  Did you say all the Donkey Kong?
[59:55.560 --> 59:56.780]  Uh-huh.
[59:56.780 --> 59:58.120]  Uh-huh.
[01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:05.610]  That's gonna be a problem.
[01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:06.910]  Oh, sheep with the coin.
[01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.150]  Sheep with the easy coin placement.
[01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:09.510]  Accessible coin.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.180]  I keep shooting myself into the floor.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:20.640]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:22.780]  Come on.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:23.840]  Stupid raccoon.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.060]  No!
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:26.900]  Yes!
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.640]  Come on, raccoon!
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.560]  Raccoon!
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.380]  Oh, no.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:34.600]  Yeah!
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.060]  Nope.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.060]  Yeah!
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.040]  Yes!
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:42.860]  Yeah!
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.800]  Here we go.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.460]  No!
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:49.800]  Yeah!
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.360]  Oh, raccoon!
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.580]  Points!
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:55.860]  Woo!
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.940]  Oh, I did a little trick at the end.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.820]  Ultimate chicken and ultimate horse
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.560]  at the top!
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.280]  But all we need is ultimate speed, baby.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.960]  What does the cart do?
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.620]  Cart keeps you consistently fast.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.140]  Soda gives you a burst.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.040]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.600]  Ultimate speed!
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:21.960]  Why me?
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:24.780]  Why?
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:25.940]  Come on!
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:26.960]  Go, go, go!
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.280]  Make it!
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.080]  Damn it!
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.160]  I should have kept ultimate speed!
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.820]  Oh, yeah!
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:36.820]  Come on!
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.300]  No!
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.600]  Save myself!
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.160]  I know how to do it!
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.060]  Let me do it!
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:43.780]  Ha!
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.040]  Oh, no!
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:50.520]  Oh, no!
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:53.700]  Oh, shit!
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:54.420]  No!
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.600]  This is some bullshit!
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.140]  Oh, Nick, you had it!
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.060]  I did!
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:02.960]  Ah!
[01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:06.950]  No!
[01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:08.850]  Come on!
[01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:11.430]  Yes, yes, yes!
[01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:13.010]  Raccoon!
[01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:13.550]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.270]  Sheep is still alive?
[01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:18.250]  Sheep!
[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.650]  Andrew, are you stuck again?
[01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.750]  Nobody knows!
[01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:27.010]  The troubles I've seen!
[01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.750]  He's trapped again!
[01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.230]  Nobody knows!
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:32.890]  The sorrow!
[01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.850]  Hey, somebody might want to send this to the developers.
[01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:37.990]  Let them know that this happens.
[01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:39.250]  What is the demo?
[01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.090]  It is to find bugs.
[01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.270]  Yeah, Andrew.
[01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.990]  Well, we found them.
[01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:47.550]  Submit your bugs.
[01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:49.770]  It's not bad, though, honestly, for what we've been doing today.
[01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.750]  Guys, we're so close. We're one minute away.
[01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:55.950]  One minute away from 5.01,
[01:02:56.090 --> 01:02:57.150]  the best time of the week.
[01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:58.610]  Let's do this thing.
[01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.530]  Look at that raccoon with the coin, baby.
[01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:01.490]  Woo!
[01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.330]  Take that sheep, you little dipshit sheep.
[01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:04.910]  Eat dirt.
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.390]  I was.
[01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:07.990]  For 30 seconds.
[01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:18.280]  Alright, let's see.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.760]  How do we want
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.060]  to do this?
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.960]  Maybe we should
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.540]  make this area more of a threat.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.380]  Yeah.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.740]  There you go.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.200]  Yeah, insane mode.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.180]  Well,
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:37.840]  it was fun while it lasted.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.080]  Come on.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.600]  Ow.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.880]  Damn it.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:44.560]  Trick.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.940]  Here we go.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:48.560]  Shit.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.740]  Damn it.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.140]  Oh no!
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.660]  What the fuck?
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.800]  How am I supposed to get past this?
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.040]  Super speed.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.220]  Ultimate speed!
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.300]  Ultimate speed.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.680]  Oh, he did it.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.720]  Oh, he lived.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.740]  I lived, bitch.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.060]  Just...
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.360]  Ultimate speed.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.040]  Ultimate speed.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.060]  That was awesome.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.140]  I'm not even mad about this one.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.520]  5-0-1.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.420]  5-0-1.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.280]  5.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:26.840]  Look at that.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.740]  Raccoons in first place.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.380]  I'm doing this for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.460]  I can't believe I screwed that up myself.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:37.900]  Okay.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:39.900]  Yeah.
[01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.770]  Oh my god.
[01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:50.710]  So you have to go above?
[01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:53.990]  Sounds like my road is the only road, son.
[01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:55.050]  What the fuck?
[01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:56.370]  Oh, I see. We have to ride.
[01:04:57.610 --> 01:04:57.830]  Come on.
[01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.370]  Damn it.
[01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:00.130]  Shit.
[01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:03.710]  I don't want to be in these. Stop making me be in these.
[01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.430]  Stop!
[01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.810]  Stop!
[01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.990]  No!
[01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:10.510]  No!
[01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:12.110]  Shit!
[01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:14.510]  Stupid chicken.
[01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:15.890]  This is bad.
[01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.290]  Oh, horse.
[01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:19.590]  In the pit.
[01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:21.070]  You're going so fast backwards.
[01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:23.910]  Oh!
[01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:25.450]  Got me there.
[01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:26.890]  God damn it.
[01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.090]  Sheep at the bottom where he belongs.
[01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.470]  Now I just need to make it impossible for several turds.
[01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:35.310]  Oh, I should have got the ace of spades.
[01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.870]  Suck.
[01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:38.550]  Oh yeah, the thing you haven't gotten to work so far?
[01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:39.050]  Yeah.
[01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:42.390]  What the?
[01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.130]  Oh, we should probably...
[01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:48.070]  Please let me out of this hellhole!
[01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:50.170]  I don't want to be in here anymore!
[01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:52.350]  Chicken!
[01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:55.810]  Oh no, he's going to do it again!
[01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:59.410]  Oh my god!
[01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:01.230]  He blew it!
[01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:02.290]  He blew it!
[01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:07.470]  Oh, he got in.
[01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:09.690]  Post-mortem.
[01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.930]  Oh my god.
[01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:15.810]  You're stupid bins.
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.330]  Screw me.
[01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.350]  The bins.
[01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.290]  The bins rule.
[01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.850]  Oh yeah?
[01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:24.450]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.630]  Take him out.
[01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:28.870]  I'm doing the same.
[01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:30.870]  Oh no!
[01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:34.210]  Why didn't you take out the bin?
[01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:35.350]  I did!
[01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.110]  I took out one of the bins.
[01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:39.950]  Why did this thing explode?
[01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.690]  The ramp should have gone!
[01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.330]  I used the ramp!
[01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:45.690]  I did it on the ramp!
[01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:49.850]  They're still there, Nick!
[01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:50.850]  What?
[01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:53.070]  Yeah, well, there were three of them.
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:54.370]  I got rid of one.
[01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:56.470]  What the Christ was that?
[01:06:57.990 --> 01:07:00.090]  How the fuck did I die?
[01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:01.370]  You moron!
[01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:02.630]  You're a moron!
[01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:03.550]  Stupid horse!
[01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.030]  No!
[01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:09.850]  I'm going to get stuck again in the hole!
[01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:10.690]  Okay.
[01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.710]  No!
[01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:14.910]  I fell off again!
[01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:16.150]  No!
[01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:18.810]  I'm going to dribble
[01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:20.290]  dick my post-mortem ass
[01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:21.150]  all the way to the end.
[01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:24.830]  Dribble dick my horse...
[01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:26.430]  God, he's really...
[01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:27.210]  Post-mortem ass.
[01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:28.770]  Stupid horse.
[01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:32.690]  I blew up one of them, Eric.
[01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:34.090]  It wasn't the one that mattered!
[01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.770]  I'm putting it back.
[01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:37.470]  That was so generous for not giving me a post-mortem there.
[01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:39.950]  I'm putting it back.
[01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:42.070]  They all mattered, Eric!
[01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:42.850]  I'm putting it back.
[01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:51.330]  It's your fault. This is on you.
[01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:51.990]  You did this.
[01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:53.290]  You did this.
[01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:55.830]  Get a grip!
[01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:57.910]  I got a grip!
[01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:10.350]  I don't want to hear it from the fucking chicken.
[01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:11.210]  Hurry up.
[01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:15.690]  What the...
[01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:18.730]  Is this such a problem?
[01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.330]  Where the hell am I?
[01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:23.830]  A little bit higher.
[01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.970]  It all smashed around.
[01:08:28.570 --> 01:08:29.130]  Go, go, go.
[01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:31.810]  How do I...
[01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:32.130]  Ah!
[01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:34.770]  I didn't go up. I'm boned.
[01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:35.990]  Go, go, go.
[01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:39.370]  Ultimate speed!
[01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:41.270]  Raccoon trick!
[01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:43.030]  Raccoon trick!
[01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:45.230]  That's bad news.
[01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:48.410]  What are you going to do, little sheep?
[01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:51.590]  What are you going to do?
[01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:53.970]  You got 23 seconds. What are you going to do, little sheep?
[01:08:55.150 --> 01:08:56.630]  What are you going to do?
[01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:57.670]  What are you going to do, little sheep?
[01:08:58.570 --> 01:09:00.630]  I'm going to do this, you son of a bitch.
[01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.650]  What do you got?
[01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.970]  What do you got, little sheep?
[01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:12.290]  I'm going back home!
[01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:13.850]  I'm going back home!
[01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:21.470]  Raccoon!
[01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.070]  That's mighty close.
[01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.710]  That's close.
[01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:36.000]  What does that do?
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.340]  I can't make it. I'm dead.
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:50.100]  Am I still alive?
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.740]  Oh, look at horse.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:55.740]  No!
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.700]  What are you going to do, horse?
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.160]  I'm going to die!
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.060]  What are you going to do, you stupid little donkey?
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.180]  What are you going to do?
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.200]  Come on, donkey brains. What are you going to do?
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.000]  I threw my controller down.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.680]  Final round.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:15.940]  One round left.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.400]  Brett251 with a tier 1 subscription.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:20.480]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.600]  He did it for me, I can tell.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.380]  Let's get there.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.600]  Oh my god.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.660]  Chicken, die.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.220]  Go press your knuckle into your ass.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.000]  Go to hell.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.880]  It's not my knuckle.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.740]  Go to hell, sheep.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:56.200]  Go to hell.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.120]  I killed myself.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:10:59.980]  Stop, raccoon!
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.440]  I want to play the game!
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:03.600]  Get me up there!
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.580]  No!
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.980]  Stupid sheep.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.860]  Float all the way.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.120]  No, squeeze through.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:12.280]  Just squeeze through the holes.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:13.920]  No!
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.120]  What are you going to do?
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:19.200]  It ended so quickly.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.540]  He's just like, no.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.580]  Gavin wins.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.860]  He went out on a win.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us for a Friday stream.

[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.900]  We had the chat voting the whole time, betting on who was going to win.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.460]  This has been Ultimate Sheep Raccoon.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.160]  The evolution of Ultimate Chicken Horse.
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.560]  And it's fun as hell.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.400]  I cannot wait for this game to come out.
