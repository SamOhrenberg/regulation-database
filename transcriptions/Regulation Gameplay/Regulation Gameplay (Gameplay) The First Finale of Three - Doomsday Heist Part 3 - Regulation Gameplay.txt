[00:00.000 --> 00:06.060]  We're back! Another heist. The end heist? The be-all end-all? Is this the end, Andrew?
[00:06.240 --> 00:10.280]  The first finale of three for the Doomsday Heists.
[00:10.780 --> 00:12.220]  What does that... what?
[00:12.720 --> 00:15.100]  Well, we did set-ups for the first heist.
[00:16.240 --> 00:16.720]  Oh!
[00:16.900 --> 00:18.560]  And there are three total heists.
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.920]  Yeah, the end ones I think are crazy. There's like juggernauts and all kinds of gumpf.
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.720]  Oh. Okay.
[00:26.060 --> 00:29.380]  And this takes place before the casino heist? That one has to be pretty epic too.
[00:29.380 --> 00:31.220]  I love the casino heist.
[00:32.740 --> 00:34.760]  There's the heist, you guys! Look at that crew!
[00:35.400 --> 00:39.160]  I'm willing to take a lower cut for my behavior in the last heist.
[00:39.700 --> 00:40.140]  Okay.
[00:40.600 --> 00:41.880]  Yeah, I mean, I'm good with that.
[00:42.580 --> 00:43.920]  I'll take a backseat cut.
[00:44.660 --> 00:45.540]  Backseat cut.
[00:45.980 --> 00:46.440]  There you go.
[00:47.060 --> 00:50.340]  And I'd be willing to give my cut to... who is most annoyed?
[00:50.580 --> 00:51.000]  I'm ready.
[00:52.120 --> 00:53.080]  Eric, for sure.
[00:53.080 --> 00:57.560]  I'm not really sure what kind of question that is.
[00:57.560 --> 00:57.960]  Why'd you ask that?
[01:00.620 --> 01:00.640]  Yeah.
[01:00.640 --> 01:02.140]  Yeah, I don't want to reward that.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.320]  Well, I'll take your 5% and maybe I can buy a closer bunker with it.
[01:12.420 --> 01:13.800]  You know that's not going to happen.
[01:14.680 --> 01:17.420]  Where my bunker was and it's the same as yours.
[01:19.200 --> 01:21.640]  When do you think Nick decides that he wants to play this?
[01:21.640 --> 01:23.240]  What are you talking about? I've been ready forever.
[01:23.520 --> 01:23.840]  Okay.
[01:25.440 --> 01:26.060]  Who's not ready?
[01:26.120 --> 01:26.660]  Now I'm ready.
[01:27.060 --> 01:27.420]  Launch a mission.
[01:27.500 --> 01:28.640]  Was it you who was not ready?
[01:29.640 --> 01:30.380]  What the fuck?
[01:31.860 --> 01:32.960]  I like the layman.
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.520]  I want a bit to see my face.
[01:34.640 --> 01:36.620]  Oh, dude, are you kidding me? I'm the snood.
[01:38.200 --> 01:39.120]  You're the snood?
[01:39.500 --> 01:42.280]  Me? Guy like me? Guy like me's the snood, baby.
[01:44.680 --> 01:46.140]  Where's my... ah, fuck.
[01:47.100 --> 01:48.120]  You okay, man?
[01:48.480 --> 01:48.920]  No, I'm alright.
[01:50.160 --> 01:50.520]  Cool.
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.000]  No one let me get my karama.
[01:53.760 --> 01:55.360]  My armored karama.
[01:56.120 --> 01:57.540]  Isn't he a running back for the saints?
[01:58.060 --> 01:58.860]  There's the snood.
[02:00.220 --> 02:01.500]  Are you guys ready for the snood?
[02:02.620 --> 02:04.040]  Isn't he Domino's mascot?
[02:04.480 --> 02:06.080]  No, I thought he was a dude on Yu Yu Hakusho.
[02:06.260 --> 02:07.600]  Avood the snood.
[02:09.860 --> 02:11.340]  Alright, so what are we doing, Andrew?
[02:11.820 --> 02:15.640]  Now this is the final heist of three heists that we did set up for or whatever.
[02:15.840 --> 02:18.020]  This is where we get the money and we're doing the data breaches.
[02:18.900 --> 02:20.700]  We gotta go to the IAA base.
[02:21.380 --> 02:21.780]  Oh, cool.
[02:22.040 --> 02:22.500]  IMF?
[02:23.020 --> 02:23.500]  IMF.
[02:23.560 --> 02:25.700]  Oh, wow. Possible mission for us again?
[02:26.420 --> 02:26.660]  Nice.
[02:29.800 --> 02:31.460]  Alright, let's go boys.
[02:31.680 --> 02:31.960]  What did you have for lunch?
[02:32.920 --> 02:33.020]  What?
[02:33.760 --> 02:34.560]  What did you have for lunch?
[02:35.400 --> 02:36.340]  I had a tamale.
[02:38.640 --> 02:41.260]  It's the holidays, so it's tamale time, baby.
[02:41.740 --> 02:42.600]  A hot tamale.
[02:43.180 --> 02:43.520]  Yep.
[02:43.520 --> 02:48.300]  I just had a smoothie because I ate two slices of pizza before we recorded earlier.
[02:48.600 --> 02:50.720]  Hell yeah. Where was the pizza from?
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.140]  A local New York style place.
[02:55.340 --> 02:55.760]  Nice.
[02:56.240 --> 02:56.860]  Very good.
[02:57.040 --> 02:57.940]  What flavor was it?
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.220]  One was cheese and the other one was pep mush.
[03:02.860 --> 03:03.960]  Pep mush.
[03:05.040 --> 03:10.220]  Did you make the smoothie or did you purchase it in its smoothie form?
[03:10.380 --> 03:11.260]  I made it.
[03:11.260 --> 03:14.480]  Did the smoothie also contain a slice of pizza?
[03:14.860 --> 03:16.760]  No, but that would be good.
[03:17.060 --> 03:17.940]  No, it would not.
[03:18.500 --> 03:19.680]  I don't think it would be good at all.
[03:21.900 --> 03:23.660]  Oh, you know what? You might be right.
[03:24.340 --> 03:25.140]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[03:26.760 --> 03:35.340]  I remember once upon a time, the broadcast team made a McDonald's smoothie for Extra Life.
[03:35.840 --> 03:36.480]  And it was terrible.
[03:37.640 --> 03:42.420]  Yeah, we once did a video where everyone in Shimano had to do their favorite thing.
[03:42.640 --> 03:51.340]  And Michael blended up a bunch of McDonald's and then had it, like, syringed into his mouth.
[03:54.100 --> 03:54.820]  That's awful.
[03:55.300 --> 03:56.740]  I almost threw up filming it.
[03:56.880 --> 03:57.880]  Yeah, I mean, that sounds right.
[03:58.280 --> 03:59.820]  I'm assuming you didn't taste it either, then.
[04:00.420 --> 04:00.780]  Who, me?
[04:00.940 --> 04:01.340]  Yeah, you.
[04:01.740 --> 04:03.260]  Oh, God, no. I could barely look at it.
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.440]  What about the other stuff? Did anyone else have any interesting bits?
[04:08.100 --> 04:09.900]  No, I don't think that was anyone else's best day.
[04:10.820 --> 04:11.200]  Got it.
[04:11.780 --> 04:16.080]  Which hand am I going to throw the C4 with? My left hand or my right hand? What am I going to do?
[04:17.280 --> 04:17.720]  Blow it.
[04:21.180 --> 04:22.040]  Oh, let's get that.
[04:22.560 --> 04:23.340]  What was that? What?
[04:23.880 --> 04:24.700]  That 18-wheeler.
[04:26.040 --> 04:26.720]  It's too far.
[04:29.320 --> 04:31.040]  Speaking of far, how far are we going for this?
[04:31.040 --> 04:32.640]  We're almost there.
[04:36.460 --> 04:37.260]  Pure gas.
[04:37.740 --> 04:43.000]  I feel reinvigorated after the last heist that we did and taking a break for a little bit.
[04:44.100 --> 04:44.900]  Definitely helped.
[04:45.580 --> 04:46.120]  That's good.
[04:48.460 --> 04:49.320]  What was that?
[04:49.480 --> 04:50.300]  Missed that turn. Way to go.
[04:50.720 --> 04:52.800]  You want to make that exit? All right. Way to go.
[04:53.180 --> 04:55.160]  Cool. Just not paying attention. Right on.
[04:55.560 --> 04:56.220]  Oh, yeah. Whoops.
[04:57.500 --> 04:58.020]  Oh, a door.
[05:01.040 --> 05:01.400]  Oh!
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.740]  Were you just doing other stuff or where was your head at?
[05:08.020 --> 05:11.440]  I got hit so hard I thought it was one of you.
[05:12.120 --> 05:13.460]  Oh, man.
[05:13.740 --> 05:14.380]  You guys want a lift?
[05:14.860 --> 05:16.980]  No, I think it's faster on foot at this point.
[05:17.740 --> 05:20.400]  Yep. I definitely agree with you.
[05:21.520 --> 05:22.400]  Are you in the car?
[05:23.260 --> 05:23.680]  Yep.
[05:24.040 --> 05:25.140]  Doesn't sound like you agree.
[05:25.660 --> 05:29.940]  Oh, no. I agree. It's definitely faster on foot at this point. 100%.
[05:30.300 --> 05:31.200]  Oh, are we sniping?
[05:32.940 --> 05:33.860]  This isn't a sniper.
[05:35.660 --> 05:37.500]  Gavin, I just did the J-turn thing that was cool.
[05:38.020 --> 05:38.480]  Did it work?
[05:38.780 --> 05:39.840]  Yeah, it looked fucking sick.
[05:42.600 --> 05:43.960]  All right. Who's the prick?
[05:45.100 --> 05:49.040]  Oh, that was you? For some reason your name was above that. I just saw an arrow. I thought it was the enemy.
[05:49.440 --> 05:51.800]  Who's hitting me? Where am I getting shot from?
[05:52.580 --> 05:55.320]  I have a sniper rifle and I'm getting picked off.
[05:55.540 --> 05:56.700]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[05:57.120 --> 05:58.120]  They're wearing a lot of armor.
[05:58.120 --> 06:00.460]  Are we not going to blow up this big truck?
[06:01.120 --> 06:02.660]  Oh, please don't blow up the truck. I'm next to it.
[06:05.740 --> 06:06.380]  Okay, clear.
[06:06.620 --> 06:08.320]  Please don't hurt the snood.
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.120]  Oh, yeah. Get in.
[06:11.620 --> 06:13.180]  I think we're going in here, Gavin.
[06:15.340 --> 06:17.800]  Wait for the team to reach the IAA base.
[06:21.160 --> 06:21.560]  Wow.
[06:26.100 --> 06:27.280]  Another one of these?
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.720]  Another bulletproof window.
[06:28.720 --> 06:31.000]  How come the snood isn't in here?
[06:32.080 --> 06:32.800]  You're snooding.
[06:33.260 --> 06:35.360]  Okay, there we go. The snood was not showing.
[06:36.580 --> 06:38.340]  All right, everyone part ways.
[06:39.080 --> 06:40.120]  What does that mean?
[06:41.220 --> 06:43.520]  It's one fucking hallway. What are you talking about?
[06:43.520 --> 06:44.460]  Yeah, just get to the sides.
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.860]  Part ways. Okay.
[06:47.080 --> 06:47.620]  All right.
[06:49.820 --> 06:50.860]  I killed him. Don't worry.
[06:51.540 --> 06:52.880]  You killed him before the bullet got there?
[06:53.080 --> 06:53.520]  Absolutely.
[06:54.120 --> 06:54.280]  Oh.
[06:54.760 --> 06:55.700]  Yeah, see how you missed again?
[06:55.700 --> 06:57.500]  But he knew fear before he died.
[06:58.380 --> 06:59.740]  He only felt fear.
[07:00.860 --> 07:02.560]  The last emotion that he felt.
[07:02.840 --> 07:06.640]  No one ever expects a bullet to come through the explosion that's about to kill them.
[07:06.640 --> 07:07.220]  That's definitely true.
[07:09.380 --> 07:10.380]  That might have been a kill.
[07:14.440 --> 07:15.680]  Oh, caught me on a reload.
[07:16.160 --> 07:16.840]  There we go.
[07:17.800 --> 07:20.000]  Oh, shit. The whole building's going up.
[07:22.860 --> 07:25.800]  Can I take this bunker once we kill everybody in it?
[07:26.660 --> 07:28.100]  It's certainly closer.
[07:28.580 --> 07:29.280]  It's a closer bunker.
[07:29.580 --> 07:31.140]  Oh, God. I'm not even getting close to Gavin.
[07:32.560 --> 07:34.220]  For safety reasons or...
[07:34.220 --> 07:34.960]  Oh, my God.
[07:35.740 --> 07:36.900]  Always safety reasons.
[07:41.740 --> 07:43.020]  Oh, God.
[07:43.400 --> 07:45.380]  Eat snacks and armor.
[07:45.800 --> 07:46.140]  Yep, yep.
[07:46.140 --> 07:46.600]  Snack and hide.
[07:50.680 --> 07:51.840]  Oh, nice.
[07:52.180 --> 07:52.540]  Merry Christmas.
[07:54.700 --> 07:56.080]  Get out of the...
[07:57.080 --> 07:58.040]  Going downstairs.
[07:59.140 --> 08:00.380]  Are we supposed to go downstairs?
[08:00.740 --> 08:00.900]  Yeah.
[08:04.560 --> 08:05.520]  Oh, God.
[08:06.640 --> 08:07.000]  Shortcut.
[08:08.940 --> 08:09.720]  Definitely short.
[08:09.920 --> 08:10.860]  Over here, Andrew.
[08:11.660 --> 08:14.660]  Oh, wow.
[08:17.000 --> 08:17.900]  Well, I'm dead.
[08:18.860 --> 08:19.220]  Why is that?
[08:19.220 --> 08:20.140]  Remember when you said over here?
[08:21.200 --> 08:21.500]  Yeah.
[08:22.560 --> 08:23.680]  Where were we supposed to go?
[08:24.120 --> 08:25.920]  I was killing a guy in a different room, Nick.
[08:26.480 --> 08:31.320]  Yeah, but why didn't you go to where Nick died so that way you could die also?
[08:32.560 --> 08:33.380]  That's a good point.
[08:33.820 --> 08:34.140]  Yeah.
[08:37.220 --> 08:38.100]  All right.
[08:38.340 --> 08:39.200]  Interesting question.
[08:40.600 --> 08:42.800]  So we say Nick was to blame?
[08:43.520 --> 08:43.840]  No.
[08:44.500 --> 08:45.260]  Well, he died.
[08:46.140 --> 08:46.580]  No.
[08:47.760 --> 08:48.540]  No what?
[08:48.640 --> 08:52.200]  I mean, okay, not assigning blame, but if we were going to...
[08:52.200 --> 08:53.140]  I mean, yeah, I died.
[08:53.340 --> 08:55.920]  I'm definitely not okay not assigning blame.
[08:56.620 --> 08:57.180]  Oh, yeah.
[08:57.200 --> 08:58.000]  We know.
[09:01.120 --> 09:01.980]  Oh, shit.
[09:03.280 --> 09:04.700]  Why don't we checkpoint at the stairs?
[09:04.920 --> 09:05.480]  Here we go, Gavin.
[09:05.660 --> 09:05.960]  Shortcut.
[09:06.360 --> 09:06.700]  Easy.
[09:06.980 --> 09:10.000]  Oh, this actually got us even closer to the ground floor.
[09:10.060 --> 09:10.640]  Yeah, we actually progressed.
[09:11.260 --> 09:11.480]  Shortcut.
[09:12.620 --> 09:14.120]  Everyone have armor on and everything or what?
[09:14.180 --> 09:14.380]  Oh, yeah.
[09:14.840 --> 09:16.080]  Hey, you're welcome, guys.
[09:16.580 --> 09:17.440]  Here to save the farm.
[09:17.660 --> 09:18.780]  Yeah, something like that.
[09:20.100 --> 09:21.200]  Oh, left side, left side, left side.
[09:21.200 --> 09:22.660]  Oh, God.
[09:23.660 --> 09:25.560]  Oh, my God.
[09:26.500 --> 09:27.100]  All right.
[09:27.120 --> 09:27.840]  One more time, boys.
[09:28.380 --> 09:32.240]  See, that time the bullet came through the explosion, but towards me.
[09:32.640 --> 09:32.840]  Yeah.
[09:32.980 --> 09:33.960]  Nick, are we assigning any blame?
[09:34.940 --> 09:35.240]  You know what?
[09:35.260 --> 09:37.000]  I'm comfortable with that this time.
[09:37.180 --> 09:43.560]  I feel like every heist is Gavin being as dumb as he can until he...
[09:43.560 --> 09:49.440]  He wants to push it to the edge of where we will break, and then he steps away from the dumb.
[09:50.580 --> 09:51.500]  Was that dumb?
[09:52.500 --> 09:53.240]  No, not...
[09:53.240 --> 09:55.420]  Well, I mean, you're just firing a rocket launcher over.
[10:00.160 --> 10:01.620]  Push it to the limit.
[10:02.200 --> 10:03.380]  Living on a...
[10:03.960 --> 10:05.640]  I'm just going to backseat this one, guys.
[10:06.780 --> 10:07.260]  Drive?
[10:08.060 --> 10:08.900]  You can't all backseat.
[10:09.300 --> 10:09.520]  Yeah.
[10:09.740 --> 10:10.020]  Shortcut.
[10:11.360 --> 10:12.340]  A little shortcut.
[10:20.180 --> 10:21.320]  Oh, my God.
[10:21.340 --> 10:22.480]  He jumped scared.
[10:23.580 --> 10:25.380]  He died a lot.
[10:26.360 --> 10:27.160]  Oh, boy.
[10:29.860 --> 10:33.760]  Wow, my health went from full to empty in a split second.
[10:34.680 --> 10:37.180]  Did you snap when he said that?
[10:37.180 --> 10:37.520]  He did.
[10:38.140 --> 10:39.500]  It was for emphasis.
[10:41.160 --> 10:42.820]  I wanted you to know.
[10:43.780 --> 10:44.700]  What do you mean, you snapped?
[10:45.180 --> 10:46.200]  I snapped my fingers.
[10:46.300 --> 10:46.580]  His fingers.
[10:47.180 --> 10:47.500]  Oh.
[10:47.740 --> 10:48.800]  Oh, yeah, I snapped.
[10:50.900 --> 10:51.740]  I don't...
[10:51.740 --> 10:54.580]  You did that as an example, like, isn't this outrageous?
[10:54.940 --> 10:57.900]  And in this video, I'm sure you've made that noise twice already.
[10:58.780 --> 10:59.260]  What?
[11:01.740 --> 11:05.040]  He said he's sure that you made that noise twice already.
[11:07.380 --> 11:08.680]  That doesn't sound like me.
[11:09.980 --> 11:10.920]  It's not like that.
[11:11.260 --> 11:11.400]  Yeah.
[11:13.380 --> 11:14.100]  Hey, Gavin.
[11:14.520 --> 11:14.820]  Shortcut.
[11:15.180 --> 11:15.400]  Shortcut.
[11:15.400 --> 11:15.620]  Shortcut.
[11:19.420 --> 11:20.140]  Oh, whoa.
[11:20.380 --> 11:21.020]  Oh, Nick.
[11:23.160 --> 11:24.200]  Hey, thanks for unloading on me, dog.
[11:24.220 --> 11:24.920]  Watch out for that jump scare.
[11:25.180 --> 11:26.140]  I didn't fire a bullet.
[11:27.800 --> 11:29.020]  Thanks for not unloading on me, dog.
[11:29.040 --> 11:29.400]  You're welcome.
[11:31.980 --> 11:32.780]  Get a job.
[11:32.860 --> 11:33.920]  I was too scared to fire.
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.900]  I'm unloading rockets.
[11:38.200 --> 11:39.460]  I like that that dude's not shorts.
[11:39.460 --> 11:39.760]  Oh, sure, what do I?
[11:40.160 --> 11:40.860]  Or get a job.
[11:47.050 --> 11:48.090]  Will you please die?
[11:48.090 --> 11:48.930]  Okay, thank you.
[11:50.750 --> 11:51.570]  Oh, running in.
[11:54.750 --> 11:55.430]  He's not dead.
[11:56.990 --> 11:58.030]  Oh, he is, wow.
[11:58.810 --> 11:59.830]  Thought there was no way.
[12:02.550 --> 12:03.970]  I guess we had to go back?
[12:05.490 --> 12:06.390]  Back the way we came?
[12:06.410 --> 12:06.650]  Oh, yeah.
[12:07.470 --> 12:08.570]  No shortcuts in reverse.
[12:10.870 --> 12:11.670]  Stupid gravity.
[12:12.010 --> 12:12.930]  Well, if we find an elevator.
[12:14.790 --> 12:15.790]  Or an escalator.
[12:15.790 --> 12:18.130]  I got bunced under the stairs.
[12:20.250 --> 12:21.490]  Gavin tried running up.
[12:21.690 --> 12:21.850]  Nope.
[12:22.530 --> 12:23.110]  More room.
[12:24.310 --> 12:24.850]  Oh, cool.
[12:26.070 --> 12:28.410]  Oh, it's the important people room.
[12:30.330 --> 12:33.050]  Alright, let's get killing.
[12:33.310 --> 12:33.730]  Cool.
[12:35.190 --> 12:36.690]  How do I sit down?
[12:37.230 --> 12:38.150]  Right on the bed.
[12:39.910 --> 12:41.870]  You have to go to the left of the chair, though, I think.
[12:43.830 --> 12:44.490]  That's true.
[12:44.490 --> 12:45.370]  He's right.
[12:47.050 --> 12:48.850]  Yeah, I did the same thing.
[12:52.030 --> 12:52.790]  Holy God.
[12:52.910 --> 12:54.050]  How's it going for you so far, boys?
[12:54.650 --> 12:55.370]  Uh, pretty fun.
[12:57.430 --> 12:59.870]  I feel like we've inceptioned into Gavin's wet dream.
[13:00.730 --> 13:01.010]  Yeah.
[13:01.430 --> 13:02.170]  Just rockets everywhere.
[13:02.650 --> 13:03.190]  That's about right.
[13:04.850 --> 13:06.330]  I mean, this is fun, isn't it?
[13:06.470 --> 13:07.410]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[13:07.890 --> 13:08.510]  I'm loving it.
[13:08.530 --> 13:08.970]  I get it.
[13:09.030 --> 13:10.050]  See how I shoot the old rockets?
[13:10.250 --> 13:11.070]  Yeah, I get it.
[13:13.990 --> 13:14.890]  Where are you going?
[13:15.070 --> 13:15.950]  Where do you think you're going?
[13:17.670 --> 13:19.350]  What would this look like from outside?
[13:19.470 --> 13:20.370]  I bet it looks nuts.
[13:20.530 --> 13:21.390]  We're seeing outside.
[13:21.890 --> 13:22.050]  What?
[13:22.350 --> 13:23.150]  Let me up!
[13:23.970 --> 13:24.690]  Stand up!
[13:30.270 --> 13:31.450]  Did we win?
[13:32.550 --> 13:32.950]  Yeah.
[13:33.070 --> 13:34.670]  I was in no rush to stand up.
[13:34.910 --> 13:36.250]  We very calmly stood up.
[13:36.830 --> 13:37.010]  Skip.
[13:37.590 --> 13:41.050]  Yeah, I think I've done this heist definitely once, and I have no idea how many times.
[13:41.070 --> 13:44.190]  I have no idea what Avon is or what the story's about.
[13:44.490 --> 13:47.710]  I should go back and read about it.
[13:49.090 --> 13:49.490]  Nah.
[13:50.190 --> 13:54.810]  What's crazy to think about is when this came out, NFTs didn't exist, but that guy would be all about NFTs.
[13:54.910 --> 13:55.290]  Oh, yeah.
[13:55.650 --> 13:58.350]  There would have been jokes in there about NFTs also.
[13:58.970 --> 14:00.110]  That guy's got a lot of doge.
[14:03.170 --> 14:03.570]  Bronze?
[14:03.790 --> 14:04.090]  Bullshit.
[14:05.510 --> 14:05.910]  Cash!
[14:06.090 --> 14:06.970]  First time bonus!
[14:07.350 --> 14:07.870]  Money, money, money.
[14:07.910 --> 14:09.130]  I got 15 job points, guys.
[14:13.110 --> 14:13.830]  I'm jealous.
[14:14.590 --> 14:15.110]  Me too.
[14:15.330 --> 14:16.090]  Wait, I got 15.
[14:17.130 --> 14:20.310]  What if an apartment in GTA 6 is 150,000 JPs?
[14:20.810 --> 14:21.050]  Oh my god.
[14:21.550 --> 14:22.130]  That's what I'm saying.
[14:22.310 --> 14:23.130]  Like, it's cool, man.
[14:23.170 --> 14:23.790]  Then we got it.
[14:23.990 --> 14:24.430]  You think?
[14:25.530 --> 14:30.650]  Before Warner shut down Rooster Teeth, anybody told them how many job points the company had?
[14:30.670 --> 14:32.370]  Because it could have made a difference.
[14:32.450 --> 14:32.730]  David!
[14:32.830 --> 14:33.170]  David!
[14:33.270 --> 14:34.470]  You're never going to believe this!
[14:35.570 --> 14:38.310]  I can't believe they let me walk out of there with all my job points.
[14:38.310 --> 14:38.770]  Yeah.
[14:40.610 --> 14:43.630]  Oh, this is where I got one of the best kills of my entire career.
[14:43.970 --> 14:44.170]  Yeah.
[14:45.350 --> 14:47.450]  Yeah, this is it.
[14:47.570 --> 14:52.470]  I nosedived a plane into the courtyard here and killed like eight enemies.
[14:53.030 --> 14:54.310]  Oh, that's awesome!
[14:55.610 --> 14:56.790]  What are we doing now, Andrew?
[14:56.910 --> 14:58.730]  Heading to the next heist set up.
[14:59.290 --> 14:59.850]  Drive in there.
[15:00.010 --> 15:00.590]  I'll be there in a minute.
[15:02.650 --> 15:03.190]  Oh, shit.
[15:03.630 --> 15:04.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:04.830 --> 15:05.710]  What's the fire thing?
[15:05.710 --> 15:10.690]  If you guys want to stay low because we're doing like the in open world set up stuff again.
[15:10.850 --> 15:13.970]  So, it'll probably be beneficial that you guys are down here.
[15:14.670 --> 15:15.650]  Oh, here we go. Uber.
[15:16.770 --> 15:18.210]  Uber for the rat. Thank you.
[15:18.310 --> 15:19.710]  I'm going to take us to the airport.
[15:20.130 --> 15:21.790]  Maybe there's some cool shit. Maybe there's a plane.
[15:21.990 --> 15:22.490]  Sounds good. Yeah.
[15:22.990 --> 15:23.750]  Better be a plane.
[15:24.510 --> 15:25.230]  Goddamn airport.
[15:25.790 --> 15:26.050]  Yeah.
[15:29.310 --> 15:29.850]  Found one.
[15:30.510 --> 15:31.730]  There's a plane already?
[15:32.430 --> 15:32.630]  Yeah.
[15:33.150 --> 15:33.670]  Oh, nice.
[15:36.530 --> 15:37.370]  Nick, where you at?
[15:37.630 --> 15:37.990]  I'm coming.
[15:38.470 --> 15:39.190]  Getting in this plane?
[15:39.670 --> 15:40.510]  Hell yeah, I am.
[15:42.290 --> 15:43.330]  Oh, co-pilot. Nice.
[15:44.050 --> 15:44.750]  Co-pilot.
[15:45.690 --> 15:46.330]  I guess we're...
[15:46.330 --> 15:46.490]  Wait.
[15:47.290 --> 15:48.870]  I guess we're taking Nick with us.
[15:49.470 --> 15:50.450]  We're his pilots.
[15:50.930 --> 15:51.110]  Ah!
[15:51.430 --> 15:52.230]  Go. There you go.
[15:52.270 --> 15:52.450]  Thank you.
[15:54.090 --> 15:54.830]  Let's turn it.
[15:55.310 --> 15:55.950]  Make it a good time.
[15:58.030 --> 15:59.210]  The weather's terrible. Get in.
[15:59.610 --> 16:00.670]  Nick, come on.
[16:00.690 --> 16:02.110]  I'm trying to get in.
[16:02.130 --> 16:03.430]  Nick, get in.
[16:04.450 --> 16:04.890]  Wah!
[16:07.790 --> 16:09.710]  All right, I'll back it up.
[16:10.210 --> 16:10.510]  He snapped.
[16:15.830 --> 16:18.170]  Please, sir, I'd like to get in the vehicle.
[16:18.610 --> 16:19.210]  Why are you circling?
[16:19.290 --> 16:20.010]  Okay, I'm in.
[16:20.810 --> 16:22.850]  Oliver Twist, known for needing to fly.
[16:25.170 --> 16:26.810]  Please, sir, I need some air.
[16:29.810 --> 16:31.110]  The Tony Hawk story.
[16:35.370 --> 16:35.730]  LAUGHTER
[16:40.330 --> 16:41.770]  That eventually got you real good.
[16:42.190 --> 16:42.730]  Yeah, it was funny.
[16:43.170 --> 16:44.190]  It was funny eventually.
[16:45.610 --> 16:46.510]  All the best kind.
[16:48.210 --> 16:50.390]  In the moment you were saying it, I was thinking,
[16:50.510 --> 16:51.950]  isn't the please, sir, can I have some more?
[16:52.030 --> 16:54.090]  Isn't that one of those famously misquoted lines?
[16:54.230 --> 16:54.890]  I bet it is.
[16:55.050 --> 16:56.730]  And then I back-listened to what you said.
[16:58.050 --> 16:58.410]  Stall.
[16:58.910 --> 16:59.230]  Uh-oh.
[17:00.770 --> 17:01.650]  How's it looking, Andrew?
[17:02.070 --> 17:02.650]  Almost there.
[17:04.670 --> 17:06.070]  Dude, we're going to be so ready.
[17:06.270 --> 17:07.910]  Middle of the map, up in the sky.
[17:08.190 --> 17:08.950]  We can go anywhere.
[17:09.170 --> 17:10.130]  Wherever you need us, dude.
[17:10.350 --> 17:12.110]  We can do six front flips, whenever you want.
[17:13.110 --> 17:14.490]  I'm going to try and land on the maze bank.
[17:14.770 --> 17:16.350]  What does it feel like when I'm in the plane?
[17:18.190 --> 17:18.330]  This?
[17:19.970 --> 17:20.370]  SCREAMING
[17:20.370 --> 17:21.310]  Oh, wow.
[17:21.690 --> 17:23.410]  This is really something when you're frozen.
[17:23.410 --> 17:25.450]  Every time you can see the ground.
[17:25.810 --> 17:26.090]  One.
[17:27.530 --> 17:27.930]  Two.
[17:28.050 --> 17:28.430]  Two.
[17:29.070 --> 17:29.470]  Three.
[17:30.190 --> 17:30.470]  Four.
[17:31.290 --> 17:31.770]  Uh...
[17:32.390 --> 17:32.630]  Four.
[17:33.310 --> 17:34.110]  Oh, my God.
[17:35.170 --> 17:37.030]  Come on, Andrew, where are you at?
[17:37.290 --> 17:38.230]  Going down the lift.
[17:40.250 --> 17:41.530]  There's not going to be much time.
[17:42.430 --> 17:43.970]  I'm running to the computer.
[17:45.390 --> 17:46.210]  Coming into the line.
[17:48.390 --> 17:48.870]  This.
[17:49.770 --> 17:50.530]  Oh, my God, Nick.
[17:50.750 --> 17:51.410]  Nick jumped.
[17:52.030 --> 17:52.850]  I almost made it.
[17:53.390 --> 17:54.490]  Great work. Nearly.
[17:55.410 --> 17:56.530]  I'm almost there.
[17:56.810 --> 17:58.090]  I'm on top of this other building.
[18:01.840 --> 18:02.400]  Hey, Gavin.
[18:02.980 --> 18:03.140]  Yeah?
[18:03.340 --> 18:04.520]  You think I can jump onto you?
[18:05.280 --> 18:05.560]  Yeah.
[18:07.020 --> 18:11.460]  If you get to the top of maze bank and I just glide over, you can probably mash Y and get in.
[18:11.480 --> 18:15.220]  I'm on top of the building just west of it.
[18:15.720 --> 18:16.160]  Send a flare.
[18:18.140 --> 18:18.640]  Let's see.
[18:19.740 --> 18:20.940]  Hold on. Okay, here we go.
[18:22.680 --> 18:23.540]  There it is. Okay.
[18:24.140 --> 18:25.400]  Coming in. Here it comes.
[18:25.480 --> 18:26.000]  All right, hit the button.
[18:27.840 --> 18:29.040]  Hit me with a flare.
[18:30.440 --> 18:31.720]  That was pretty cool.
[18:31.880 --> 18:33.020]  That was cool.
[18:33.860 --> 18:34.740]  Money spent.
[18:35.120 --> 18:36.080]  Where are they?
[18:36.480 --> 18:37.180]  Skipping cut scene.
[18:37.440 --> 18:40.280]  All right. We're going to get the objective any time now.
[18:41.060 --> 18:41.920]  Mark it, Eric.
[18:47.580 --> 18:48.580]  Oh, here we go.
[18:49.320 --> 18:50.120]  We're off.
[18:50.440 --> 18:50.800]  Where is that?
[18:51.160 --> 18:51.860]  Oh, it's real close.
[18:52.880 --> 18:53.620]  Go get it, Nick.
[18:54.060 --> 18:54.780]  I'm on my way.
[18:55.620 --> 18:56.860]  Can you, like, jump there?
[18:58.580 --> 19:00.180]  I already used my chute.
[19:03.620 --> 19:05.580]  Get their van while they're occupied.
[19:07.560 --> 19:08.800]  You're on top of it.
[19:13.090 --> 19:13.970]  Nick died.
[19:14.570 --> 19:14.850]  Oh, no.
[19:15.130 --> 19:15.570]  Still the riot.
[19:15.790 --> 19:16.310]  You got it.
[19:16.890 --> 19:18.450]  The chute didn't deploy, Andrew.
[19:21.090 --> 19:21.910]  What's the riot?
[19:22.410 --> 19:23.110]  I think it's a car.
[19:24.610 --> 19:25.230]  Coming in hot.
[19:26.530 --> 19:27.010]  Oh, wow.
[19:29.750 --> 19:31.690]  They blew me up.
[19:31.690 --> 19:34.110]  Oh, my God.
[19:34.650 --> 19:36.990]  What the hell?
[19:37.590 --> 19:38.790]  Why is everyone dying?
[19:40.310 --> 19:41.370]  What happened?
[19:42.190 --> 19:43.350]  It was a startup.
[19:45.430 --> 19:46.750]  Eric predicted a riot.
[19:47.250 --> 19:47.970]  I did.
[19:51.800 --> 19:53.860]  Oh, it's a riot van.
[19:54.420 --> 19:54.800]  Oh, okay.
[19:54.920 --> 19:55.420]  I'll get in the back.
[19:55.700 --> 19:56.160]  You getting in?
[19:56.680 --> 19:56.880]  Yep.
[19:57.640 --> 19:57.940]  Okay.
[19:58.100 --> 19:58.820]  I'm almost there.
[19:59.680 --> 20:00.120]  Okay.
[20:00.960 --> 20:01.620]  It doesn't matter to me.
[20:01.620 --> 20:03.440]  Oh, there are cops all over the place.
[20:05.120 --> 20:06.080]  Oh, it's Nick again.
[20:06.400 --> 20:07.740]  It keeps putting arrows above Nick.
[20:14.470 --> 20:15.330]  Nick, you getting in?
[20:16.190 --> 20:16.530]  Yep.
[20:17.530 --> 20:17.990]  Let Nick hit.
[20:20.150 --> 20:20.770]  Here I go.
[20:25.510 --> 20:26.830]  Get in, you moron.
[20:26.870 --> 20:27.170]  No!
[20:27.510 --> 20:28.150]  Way to go, Nick.
[20:28.410 --> 20:30.330]  All right, hit us on the next intersection, moron.
[20:31.050 --> 20:31.310]  Nope.
[20:31.670 --> 20:31.990]  Game.
[20:32.130 --> 20:32.550]  Not Nick.
[20:32.990 --> 20:33.290]  Game.
[20:36.350 --> 20:39.490]  No, the cops forced me down a pathway.
[20:39.970 --> 20:40.670]  Come on, Nick.
[20:40.730 --> 20:41.210]  Put it together.
[20:42.430 --> 20:43.890]  What's wrong with you, buddy?
[20:47.030 --> 20:49.210]  That's worse than the other noise you made earlier.
[20:49.450 --> 20:49.770]  Oh, no.
[20:50.410 --> 20:52.070]  Nick's got noise2.wav.
[20:52.250 --> 20:53.070]  Yeah, that's bad.
[20:54.990 --> 20:56.030]  Oh, it's that bird shirt.
[20:58.550 --> 21:01.730]  I wish we still had the jet.
[21:02.010 --> 21:02.830]  Killing me cops.
[21:03.770 --> 21:04.590]  What happened to the jet?
[21:05.050 --> 21:05.690]  Blew up.
[21:07.170 --> 21:08.610]  It blew up or it got shot down?
[21:09.170 --> 21:11.470]  No, it landed in the street and then the police crashed into it.
[21:11.610 --> 21:13.270]  Oh, Andrew, what happened?
[21:13.730 --> 21:18.210]  I had a bunch of cops on me and I just didn't feel like living my wanted properly.
[21:18.590 --> 21:19.050]  Got it.
[21:19.930 --> 21:21.570]  Ooh, I don't know if I can make this turn in time.
[21:22.470 --> 21:23.370]  Come on, damn it.
[21:29.210 --> 21:30.830]  Don't worry, Nick's leading him right to us.
[21:31.450 --> 21:32.230]  No, I'm helping.
[21:34.930 --> 21:37.710]  Nick, he's literally leading them right to us again.
[21:40.990 --> 21:42.410]  Quick, you gotta go up the hill faster.
[21:43.130 --> 21:44.490]  I gotta make a turn here.
[21:44.990 --> 21:45.190]  Oh.
[21:49.350 --> 21:50.250]  Oh, I can get in.
[21:50.690 --> 21:51.690]  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
[21:52.790 --> 21:53.550]  He didn't stop.
[21:54.150 --> 21:54.750]  Yeah, no shit.
[21:56.370 --> 21:57.490]  I could provide support.
[21:57.710 --> 21:59.790]  No, do you know where we are?
[22:00.590 --> 22:01.390]  Oh, no.
[22:02.090 --> 22:02.390]  All right.
[22:02.570 --> 22:03.250]  Oh, no.
[22:04.170 --> 22:05.990]  All right, hang on, I gotta make a right up this thing.
[22:07.510 --> 22:08.230]  Oh, no.
[22:08.590 --> 22:09.430]  Nick, do you have a wanted level or no?
[22:10.010 --> 22:10.630]  Uh, yeah.
[22:11.230 --> 22:12.990]  Okay, then stay away from us because we don't.
[22:14.690 --> 22:15.390]  You're all the way in the city.
[22:16.190 --> 22:18.530]  You remember the heist that took three and a half hours?
[22:20.990 --> 22:22.310]  The very same hill.
[22:22.770 --> 22:23.630]  Hey, they're gone.
[22:25.030 --> 22:25.810]  Okay, get in.
[22:26.910 --> 22:27.250]  Okay.
[22:28.410 --> 22:29.110]  Where are you?
[22:29.230 --> 22:29.690]  Oh, there you are.
[22:35.450 --> 22:35.810]  Hey.
[22:37.450 --> 22:38.110]  All right, I'm in.
[22:38.250 --> 22:38.770]  Hey, Nick.
[22:38.770 --> 22:39.250]  What's up?
[22:39.410 --> 22:39.810]  Hey, Gavin.
[22:40.570 --> 22:41.070]  Oh, he made it.
[22:41.170 --> 22:42.250]  You're the first person up in this.
[22:42.450 --> 22:43.390]  Oh, what's up, man?
[22:43.690 --> 22:44.290]  Hey, what's up, man?
[22:47.810 --> 22:48.530]  Oh, wow.
[22:48.910 --> 22:49.970]  It says safe on your bomb.
[22:50.310 --> 22:51.430]  Oh, that didn't seem safe.
[22:51.890 --> 22:53.310]  Please don't make us get more wanted level.
[22:53.590 --> 22:54.430]  We already lost it.
[22:54.490 --> 22:55.610]  We just have to drop this off.
[22:56.590 --> 22:57.490]  Press Y to lean out.
[22:58.430 --> 22:58.950]  Take a right.
[23:00.710 --> 23:01.510]  He went left.
[23:02.530 --> 23:03.190]  Take a left.
[23:03.390 --> 23:03.850]  I'm sorry.
[23:04.010 --> 23:04.370]  Who are these?
[23:04.630 --> 23:06.670]  What the hell is everyone doing?
[23:06.670 --> 23:09.370]  When I see this hill, I want to go up it.
[23:09.410 --> 23:10.630]  It just reminds me of better times.
[23:10.830 --> 23:11.710]  Three and a half hour heist.
[23:11.810 --> 23:12.350]  Things like that.
[23:13.550 --> 23:15.010]  Everyone's losing it on the ice.
[23:15.810 --> 23:17.110]  Oh, that is what happened.
[23:17.210 --> 23:17.910]  That's awesome.
[23:22.110 --> 23:23.710]  This is the slippery day heist.
[23:24.130 --> 23:25.410]  Now that's new content.
[23:25.930 --> 23:26.610]  The snow day heist.
[23:28.190 --> 23:29.490]  The new big quotes.
[23:30.150 --> 23:31.170]  For the slippery bandits.
[23:31.530 --> 23:33.370]  Do we have to drive this all the way to your hideout?
[23:33.790 --> 23:34.070]  Yup.
[23:35.110 --> 23:36.430]  Oh, God.
[23:37.550 --> 23:39.050]  Can we just cargo-bob it there?
[23:39.410 --> 23:39.830]  God.
[23:41.070 --> 23:44.270]  You know, we can stay behind and get a cargo-bob ready for the next thing.
[23:47.550 --> 23:48.450]  Alright, bye idiots.
[23:49.330 --> 23:51.610]  Oh, the snow doesn't hurt as bad when you jump out.
[23:51.830 --> 23:52.630]  No, that was great.
[23:53.770 --> 23:55.270]  Alright, we need some wheels.
[23:55.430 --> 23:55.930]  Yeah, we do.
[23:56.790 --> 23:57.490]  Excuse me.
[23:57.670 --> 23:57.970]  Pardon.
[23:59.350 --> 23:59.770]  Alright.
[24:01.510 --> 24:02.610]  Oh, it's a minivan.
[24:02.610 --> 24:04.070]  I've got a better snow vehicle.
[24:04.130 --> 24:04.770]  Oh, do you?
[24:05.770 --> 24:06.470]  Oh, damn.
[24:08.810 --> 24:09.690]  Alright, get in, Nick.
[24:09.950 --> 24:10.170]  Okay.
[24:10.890 --> 24:12.050]  Is it skis?
[24:12.290 --> 24:12.690]  Okay.
[24:16.050 --> 24:16.530]  Alright.
[24:16.750 --> 24:17.290]  Is it a snowboard?
[24:17.950 --> 24:18.710]  Oh, my God.
[24:19.790 --> 24:20.270]  Ow!
[24:20.270 --> 24:22.330]  I'm kind of surprised they never added skis or anything.
[24:22.330 --> 24:23.230]  That guy ran me down!
[24:23.250 --> 24:23.750]  Yeah, right?
[24:25.090 --> 24:26.130]  Gavin, stop!
[24:27.030 --> 24:28.670]  Why wouldn't you get in?
[24:28.670 --> 24:32.450]  Gavin, like, Nick can't get into vehicles, man.
[24:32.530 --> 24:32.910]  I don't know.
[24:32.990 --> 24:33.790]  Yeah, no!
[24:34.270 --> 24:34.630]  No!
[24:35.950 --> 24:37.630]  Appreciate you agreeing at first, though.
[24:37.630 --> 24:37.990]  Thank you.
[24:38.750 --> 24:39.110]  No!
[24:39.290 --> 24:40.690]  No, I never agreed.
[24:43.030 --> 24:44.770]  Alright, Nick, can I have a mark for the airport?
[24:45.150 --> 24:46.170]  You got it.
[24:47.090 --> 24:48.410]  We may need to cargo a riot.
[24:50.170 --> 24:50.790]  There you go.
[24:51.210 --> 24:51.790]  Andrew, where are you?
[24:52.250 --> 24:53.430]  I'm still at the thing.
[24:55.310 --> 24:56.110]  What's the thing?
[24:56.270 --> 24:57.070]  You just sat in your base?
[24:57.090 --> 24:57.630]  You never left the bunker?
[24:57.630 --> 24:58.270]  Yeah, the base.
[24:58.850 --> 24:59.410]  That makes sense.
[24:59.930 --> 25:01.230]  Yeah, I was like, what's the point?
[25:02.130 --> 25:03.290]  You need to go back here anyway.
[25:03.850 --> 25:05.050]  You're on the other side of the map.
[25:05.730 --> 25:06.950]  Just the eye in the sky.
[25:07.490 --> 25:08.770]  You sound like someone...
[25:08.770 --> 25:14.090]  Well, I guess you've just proven right every single, like, home delivery grocery service.
[25:14.770 --> 25:16.690]  What's the point of going out and running errands?
[25:17.850 --> 25:19.050]  Why don't you have them run to me?
[25:19.570 --> 25:22.330]  Do you have the orbital strike computer thing in your base?
[25:23.150 --> 25:23.550]  Ooh.
[25:24.850 --> 25:27.850]  The one that costs, like, 750 grand to fire or something?
[25:28.510 --> 25:31.510]  Oh, no, okay. Well, I don't even have the money to fire it if I did.
[25:32.770 --> 25:35.790]  I think it costs, like, eight real bucks to fire it or something.
[25:38.530 --> 25:39.890]  My empanada was spicy.
[25:40.550 --> 25:42.190]  Now you get a spicy empanada?
[25:43.790 --> 25:44.390]  Unexpectedly so.
[25:44.950 --> 25:45.830]  What kind of empanada?
[25:46.690 --> 25:47.170]  I don't know.
[25:48.350 --> 25:49.210]  I didn't order it.
[25:50.930 --> 25:51.730]  Oh, God!
[25:52.930 --> 25:53.410]  Shit.
[25:56.270 --> 25:57.070]  Like a glove.
[25:57.950 --> 26:00.010]  Alright, making our way through. Here we go.
[26:00.870 --> 26:01.690]  Tower of pimps right there.
[26:02.810 --> 26:03.310]  Oh, yeah.
[26:05.230 --> 26:05.510]  Ah!
[26:08.030 --> 26:10.130]  My itchy face almost got us killed.
[26:10.430 --> 26:10.830]  Itch!
[26:11.510 --> 26:12.710]  Oh, shit.
[26:13.070 --> 26:13.390]  Oh, shit.
[26:13.630 --> 26:14.330]  Oh, shit!
[26:14.550 --> 26:14.670]  Oh!
[26:15.350 --> 26:15.830]  Eric!
[26:16.570 --> 26:17.350]  Hi, Andrew.
[26:17.690 --> 26:17.910]  Hey!
[26:18.350 --> 26:19.630]  I brought you a riot van.
[26:19.730 --> 26:20.870]  Oh, it's a riot van.
[26:20.870 --> 26:21.630]  Yep.
[26:22.430 --> 26:23.270]  Hell, yeah!
[26:23.990 --> 26:24.770]  Hell, yeah.
[26:24.990 --> 26:25.550]  Hell, yeah.
[26:25.830 --> 26:26.830]  Alright, who needs a ride?
[26:29.650 --> 26:30.070]  Alright.
[26:33.370 --> 26:33.970]  Who's eating?
[26:34.490 --> 26:35.310]  Nick, what are you eating?
[26:35.490 --> 26:36.050]  No, not you.
[26:37.390 --> 26:38.350]  I heard a crunch.
[26:38.850 --> 26:39.150]  Me too.
[26:39.310 --> 26:39.590]  You heard a crunch?
[26:40.790 --> 26:41.470]  That's my crunch.
[26:41.810 --> 26:42.070]  Oh!
[26:44.210 --> 26:45.090]  What are you eating?
[26:46.350 --> 26:46.770]  Empanada.
[26:48.590 --> 26:50.350]  The crunchiest empanada in the lane.
[26:50.350 --> 26:52.390]  It's a spicy empanada, but you don't know what's in it.
[26:54.470 --> 26:55.910]  We also still don't know what he's eating.
[26:56.530 --> 26:58.250]  Well, based on his mm-mm, I assume it's empanada.
[26:58.250 --> 27:00.030]  I'm gonna say potato and onion and spice.
[27:00.890 --> 27:00.990]  Huh.
[27:03.750 --> 27:04.070]  So...
[27:04.070 --> 27:05.250]  We didn't get a cargo, Bob.
[27:05.850 --> 27:08.550]  We could go to the upstairs airport.
[27:09.190 --> 27:11.390]  Oh, you went to the downstairs airport?
[27:12.190 --> 27:12.510]  Yeah.
[27:12.990 --> 27:13.650]  Oh, what a mistake.
[27:14.210 --> 27:16.110]  They went to the fucking downstairs port.
[27:19.930 --> 27:20.630]  Here we go.
[27:21.630 --> 27:22.430]  Here we go.
[27:22.450 --> 27:23.950]  This one has four set-up missions.
[27:24.570 --> 27:24.890]  Nice.
[27:25.310 --> 27:25.950]  Holy shit.
[27:26.410 --> 27:27.070]  Kill the things.
[27:30.390 --> 27:32.710]  They're all in, uh, north whatever.
[27:34.250 --> 27:35.710]  How do I have a... oh, you mocked one already?
[27:35.910 --> 27:36.310]  I did.
[27:36.890 --> 27:37.210]  Okay.
[27:37.510 --> 27:38.190]  What are you doing, Adrian?
[27:38.190 --> 27:38.810]  Oh, they're moving, though.
[27:39.170 --> 27:40.650]  I'm spawning a plane.
[27:40.850 --> 27:40.950]  There you go.
[27:41.430 --> 27:41.710]  Okay.
[27:42.050 --> 27:43.110]  I'll get out and get him if you want.
[27:43.110 --> 27:43.810]  I'll hang out with you, then.
[27:44.090 --> 27:44.410]  Alright.
[27:44.670 --> 27:45.530]  Alright, see you on the other side.
[27:45.530 --> 27:46.510]  See you, sir.
[27:46.530 --> 27:46.890]  There it is.
[27:47.470 --> 27:48.730]  We're gonna have to run to it.
[27:49.810 --> 27:50.290]  Okay.
[27:56.950 --> 27:57.910]  Oh, shit!
[27:59.510 --> 28:00.250]  You okay?
[28:00.850 --> 28:01.750]  Yeah, I just hit a wall.
[28:02.110 --> 28:02.490]  Okay.
[28:03.810 --> 28:05.430]  Where is this helicopter?
[28:07.010 --> 28:07.990]  Oh, it's not a helicopter.
[28:08.870 --> 28:09.350]  What?
[28:09.710 --> 28:11.750]  It's not a helicopter, it's an aerial vehicle.
[28:12.730 --> 28:13.630]  What does that mean?
[28:14.290 --> 28:15.030]  It flies.
[28:15.550 --> 28:17.190]  Yeah, a pencil's a writing utensil.
[28:22.190 --> 28:22.990]  There it is.
[28:23.130 --> 28:23.250]  Where?
[28:24.370 --> 28:25.070]  It's on the beach.
[28:26.450 --> 28:27.970]  Wait, where does this go?
[28:28.030 --> 28:28.630]  What is this?
[28:29.150 --> 28:30.530]  What the fuck is this?
[28:31.390 --> 28:32.970]  It's what I spawned.
[28:34.230 --> 28:36.290]  I don't think I can get in this with you.
[28:39.610 --> 28:40.710]  What the fuck?
[28:44.310 --> 28:46.290]  I'm gonna be honest, I didn't mean to spawn this.
[28:47.890 --> 28:48.770]  Okay, well...
[28:48.770 --> 28:49.630]  Good luck!
[28:49.990 --> 28:51.950]  They're on bicycles, Gavin. They're on bicycles.
[28:54.010 --> 28:55.750]  We have to do this the right way.
[28:55.870 --> 28:58.110]  Shit, you killed it. You killed it. Fuck.
[28:58.330 --> 29:00.830]  Good. Good. Fuck you.
[29:02.530 --> 29:02.790]  Oh, wait.
[29:03.590 --> 29:06.350]  Oh, no, it's fine. It's just the back propeller doesn't spin anymore.
[29:06.850 --> 29:08.390]  That feels like it should be necessary.
[29:09.850 --> 29:12.310]  Andrew could have spawned a helicopter or a plane.
[29:12.430 --> 29:14.630]  He spawned a da Vinci flying machine.
[29:14.630 --> 29:19.030]  I thought I was spawning a plane.
[29:20.050 --> 29:23.270]  I was actively trying to not spawn this.
[29:24.210 --> 29:27.570]  You spawned something I found written on a desk in Assassin's Creed.
[29:28.030 --> 29:29.970]  That's absolutely what it is.
[29:30.270 --> 29:31.390]  What the fuck?
[29:33.430 --> 29:35.250]  Oh, shit. Is that my car?
[29:35.570 --> 29:36.930]  It's sputtering out.
[29:37.470 --> 29:37.870]  Good.
[29:38.690 --> 29:40.890]  Oh, shit, I found the wreckage of your craft.
[29:41.490 --> 29:42.490]  Oh, you did? How's it looking?
[29:42.930 --> 29:43.650]  Uh, pretty bad.
[29:45.250 --> 29:46.850]  In the brief second that I saw it.
[29:49.030 --> 29:51.390]  Your personal aircraft has been destroyed.
[29:52.150 --> 29:52.590]  Good.
[29:53.150 --> 29:54.750]  I didn't make it over the mountain.
[29:55.090 --> 29:56.110]  All right, I took out some dealers.
[29:56.970 --> 29:59.450]  I'm still over your stupid fucking base.
[29:59.930 --> 30:02.770]  Oh, no, I'm still floating down, but I have no steering control.
[30:03.150 --> 30:04.290]  We're going down.
[30:04.650 --> 30:06.210]  We're going down.
[30:07.770 --> 30:09.330]  Just me and Nick doing this thing, huh?
[30:09.490 --> 30:10.670]  Oh, it's a fireman.
[30:14.350 --> 30:15.870]  That's all right, Gavin. We knew what this was.
[30:16.210 --> 30:16.350]  Yeah.
[30:16.910 --> 30:18.250]  I'm going to spawn a different plane.
[30:18.250 --> 30:19.050]  Are you close to the last dealer?
[30:19.170 --> 30:19.970]  Yeah, I'm almost there.
[30:21.730 --> 30:23.010]  Oh, it's a cyclist.
[30:23.890 --> 30:24.610]  You enter traffic.
[30:27.950 --> 30:30.770]  Was that an attempt at a one-liner before you killed him?
[30:31.230 --> 30:31.410]  Yeah.
[30:31.750 --> 30:32.730]  He didn't hear it. He died.
[30:33.330 --> 30:34.110]  I don't think anyone heard it.
[30:34.110 --> 30:34.790]  I'm going to jump over you.
[30:35.270 --> 30:35.630]  Okay.
[30:36.670 --> 30:37.250]  How'd you do?
[30:38.030 --> 30:38.610]  Nailed it.
[30:39.550 --> 30:41.110]  As in, you nailed me.
[30:45.100 --> 30:46.000]  Where are we going?
[30:46.740 --> 30:47.640]  5.94 miles.
[30:48.280 --> 30:49.280]  Oh, boy, it's so far.
[30:49.940 --> 30:52.260]  We should just stay up here, so that way...
[30:52.260 --> 30:53.120]  You can spawn the next one.
[30:53.120 --> 30:54.600]  You can start the mission again.
[30:55.300 --> 30:55.740]  Yeah.
[30:56.620 --> 30:57.960]  Just to start the mission again.
[30:58.980 --> 31:00.220]  God, that sucks.
[31:01.600 --> 31:02.400]  What is that?
[31:04.920 --> 31:06.180]  What are some of these vehicles?
[31:08.480 --> 31:09.940]  You looking at stuff that you can call in?
[31:10.660 --> 31:11.540]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[31:12.080 --> 31:12.760]  Is that a limo?
[31:12.760 --> 31:14.220]  Yeah, I just called it in.
[31:14.520 --> 31:15.400]  Oh, I've got a limo.
[31:15.740 --> 31:16.420]  Oh, shit.
[31:17.780 --> 31:18.340]  Get in.
[31:18.680 --> 31:19.960]  I'm trying. Hang on.
[31:21.440 --> 31:22.100]  There we go.
[31:24.340 --> 31:24.960]  Oh, my God.
[31:25.380 --> 31:26.420]  That guy flipped his shit.
[31:26.440 --> 31:27.260]  I'm going to go into first person.
[31:27.500 --> 31:27.860]  Ooh.
[31:28.020 --> 31:28.940]  Where are you, Gavin?
[31:28.940 --> 31:30.180]  First person limo, baby.
[31:30.680 --> 31:31.420]  I'm at the apartment.
[31:31.860 --> 31:32.780]  Oh, where that dude is?
[31:33.240 --> 31:33.900]  I'm going in hot.
[31:34.900 --> 31:35.820]  All right, I'm on my way.
[31:36.660 --> 31:37.320]  Can I see you?
[31:37.600 --> 31:39.000]  I can see you in the back.
[31:41.300 --> 31:42.300]  Oh, shit.
[31:42.340 --> 31:43.460]  I should be looking forward.
[31:43.900 --> 31:45.440]  You son of a bitch.
[31:48.000 --> 31:48.880]  God, you dick.
[31:49.000 --> 31:49.360]  Oh, sorry.
[31:49.400 --> 31:50.180]  I shot your shin off.
[31:51.000 --> 31:51.880]  Oh, dear.
[31:53.300 --> 31:54.420]  Reinforcements are on the way.
[31:55.260 --> 31:56.060]  Yeah, that's us.
[31:56.220 --> 31:56.880]  We're coming.
[31:58.520 --> 32:00.260]  Yeah, you guys.
[32:02.820 --> 32:03.700]  Nice poster.
[32:04.420 --> 32:05.260]  Corkers and blood.
[32:12.210 --> 32:13.430]  That's a fun way to turn.
[32:14.090 --> 32:15.910]  They just magicked in there.
[32:19.170 --> 32:19.970]  Show cut.
[32:21.590 --> 32:21.970]  I'm here.
[32:23.050 --> 32:24.150]  We have to get to the roof or what?
[32:24.850 --> 32:25.790]  No, it's just in the apartment.
[32:26.110 --> 32:26.230]  Oh.
[32:30.650 --> 32:31.050]  Again.
[32:32.030 --> 32:32.850]  What happened, Andrew?
[32:32.890 --> 32:33.570]  Hey, guess who's back?
[32:33.690 --> 32:34.290]  Spawning a new plane.
[32:35.470 --> 32:35.930]  Hell yeah.
[32:37.270 --> 32:37.950]  Guess who's returned?
[32:39.390 --> 32:40.110]  Where is it?
[32:41.050 --> 32:42.850]  You son of a bitch, I just got here.
[32:43.450 --> 32:44.210]  Down there.
[32:44.830 --> 32:45.590]  X to the apartment.
[32:46.490 --> 32:47.510]  Alright, is my limo still there?
[32:49.150 --> 32:49.530]  No.
[32:50.170 --> 32:50.770]  Oh, damn.
[32:51.730 --> 32:52.510]  Here, we'll take this.
[32:54.530 --> 32:56.190]  Eric and I are on our way to help.
[32:57.130 --> 32:57.430]  Sweet.
[32:57.670 --> 32:58.070]  Don't bother.
[32:59.050 --> 32:59.270]  Okay.
[32:59.630 --> 33:00.190]  We're coming.
[33:00.850 --> 33:02.210]  Oh my god, Andrew.
[33:02.930 --> 33:04.490]  Are you coming in something that can pick us up though?
[33:04.630 --> 33:04.850]  Yeah.
[33:04.930 --> 33:05.970]  Because we need to get to the facility.
[33:08.070 --> 33:08.270]  Yeah.
[33:09.910 --> 33:11.110]  We might be...
[33:11.110 --> 33:11.570]  One sec.
[33:11.570 --> 33:11.950]  Yeah, hang on.
[33:12.430 --> 33:14.290]  This fucking snowman is...
[33:14.290 --> 33:14.590]  Whoa!
[33:14.770 --> 33:15.810]  That was awesome, dude!
[33:16.110 --> 33:16.770]  That looked great.
[33:16.870 --> 33:18.930]  It's like I'm driving a fucking foot-long sub.
[33:20.890 --> 33:22.070]  Pick us up in the sub.
[33:22.950 --> 33:23.210]  No.
[33:23.290 --> 33:23.550]  Okay.
[33:24.250 --> 33:25.550]  You gotta back up a little bit.
[33:25.650 --> 33:25.910]  I can't.
[33:25.910 --> 33:27.250]  You gotta back up and angle it.
[33:27.730 --> 33:28.750]  You gotta angle it.
[33:29.030 --> 33:30.010]  You gotta...
[33:30.010 --> 33:32.030]  You gotta angle it a little bit.
[33:32.090 --> 33:32.630]  You just have to back...
[33:32.630 --> 33:32.890]  I'm trying.
[33:33.130 --> 33:33.930]  Just back it up.
[33:34.090 --> 33:34.870]  You gotta back it up.
[33:34.930 --> 33:35.630]  Go back into it.
[33:35.950 --> 33:36.450]  I'm trying to hold forward.
[33:36.610 --> 33:36.910]  It's just not working.
[33:37.310 --> 33:38.170]  Well, don't go forward.
[33:38.210 --> 33:38.650]  Hold back.
[33:38.650 --> 33:40.450]  You gotta go back and then to the side.
[33:40.750 --> 33:41.090]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:41.150 --> 33:41.870]  Spin it to the left.
[33:41.970 --> 33:42.590]  Yep, yep.
[33:42.970 --> 33:44.610]  You guys are watching The Supremes.
[33:44.730 --> 33:45.270]  What the hell are you doing?
[33:45.530 --> 33:47.290]  Okay, go left and then go right.
[33:47.350 --> 33:47.790]  Hard right.
[33:48.070 --> 33:48.430]  Okay, ready?
[33:49.030 --> 33:50.090]  And back and hard.
[33:50.170 --> 33:50.530]  There you go.
[33:50.590 --> 33:50.730]  See?
[33:50.790 --> 33:51.310]  Hard left.
[33:51.770 --> 33:53.270]  Keep going back and then hard right.
[33:53.410 --> 33:54.650]  And then you got a hard left.
[33:54.670 --> 33:55.230]  How dare you?
[33:55.390 --> 33:55.970]  There you go.
[33:56.130 --> 33:56.430]  Come on.
[33:56.510 --> 33:57.010]  There you go.
[33:57.090 --> 33:57.450]  Come on.
[33:58.490 --> 33:58.910]  Come on.
[33:58.990 --> 34:00.090]  And then you got a hard right.
[34:00.210 --> 34:00.690]  I'm spinning it.
[34:00.690 --> 34:00.910]  You got it.
[34:01.050 --> 34:01.750]  I'm spinning it.
[34:02.090 --> 34:02.570]  You got it.
[34:02.950 --> 34:03.670]  I'm spinning it.
[34:04.810 --> 34:05.330]  We're out.
[34:05.330 --> 34:06.530]  Oh, nice, nice.
[34:06.590 --> 34:07.270]  We're good, we're good.
[34:07.370 --> 34:07.890]  We're on our way.
[34:11.870 --> 34:12.910]  Are we stuck?
[34:13.510 --> 34:14.330]  We're a bit stuck.
[34:17.130 --> 34:18.030]  Andrew, I got us.
[34:18.210 --> 34:19.650]  Andrew, Andrew, I got us out.
[34:19.710 --> 34:20.950]  No, no, I got us out.
[34:21.030 --> 34:21.550]  That wasn't you.
[34:21.590 --> 34:22.310]  I got us out.
[34:22.510 --> 34:23.270]  What do you mean?
[34:23.330 --> 34:23.990]  I got us out.
[34:24.490 --> 34:25.250]  We're out of there.
[34:25.550 --> 34:26.250]  Hey, Nick, new car.
[34:26.830 --> 34:28.430]  Hey, that looks familiar.
[34:29.410 --> 34:31.170]  Run to the helicopter now or the plane.
[34:31.530 --> 34:32.370]  It's a plane.
[34:32.470 --> 34:33.050]  You have a plane?
[34:33.250 --> 34:33.610]  Nice job.
[34:34.350 --> 34:36.130]  Oh, no, the tires are out.
[34:36.210 --> 34:36.930]  The tires are out.
[34:37.170 --> 34:39.150]  Oh, the rabbit's going to beat me to the jet.
[34:39.470 --> 34:40.610]  Another tire went out.
[34:40.730 --> 34:41.210]  Rabbit, I'm faster.
[34:41.890 --> 34:42.370]  Damn it.
[34:43.170 --> 34:44.890]  We need another set of wheels.
[34:45.670 --> 34:46.690]  In the snow.
[34:46.890 --> 34:47.550]  No tires.
[34:53.310 --> 34:54.190]  All right.
[34:55.210 --> 34:56.390]  I can't stand up.
[34:56.990 --> 34:57.690]  I'm stuck.
[34:57.790 --> 34:58.630]  I'm stuck under it.
[34:59.390 --> 34:59.910]  Hold on, Gavin.
[35:00.830 --> 35:01.670]  I got it.
[35:01.950 --> 35:02.410]  It's perfect.
[35:06.170 --> 35:06.770]  I'll get in the back.
[35:07.170 --> 35:07.530]  Okay.
[35:09.390 --> 35:10.410]  Where's it taking me?
[35:10.410 --> 35:10.650]  We got company, by the way.
[35:10.670 --> 35:12.710]  Why did you park the car?
[35:13.050 --> 35:13.610]  I didn't.
[35:13.670 --> 35:14.370]  I jumped out of the car.
[35:14.590 --> 35:16.670]  Yeah, but you lost it.
[35:19.850 --> 35:20.210]  Wahoo!
[35:22.330 --> 35:23.050]  Oh, shit.
[35:23.410 --> 35:23.670]  Okay.
[35:25.150 --> 35:26.350]  Oh, we're getting lit up.
[35:26.870 --> 35:27.390]  All right, guys.
[35:27.430 --> 35:28.470]  Here we come to rescue you.
[35:28.590 --> 35:29.370]  Here we're coming to pick you up.
[35:29.830 --> 35:30.810]  Here we're coming to rescue you.
[35:31.650 --> 35:32.890]  I wouldn't take off without me, buddy.
[35:41.070 --> 35:42.290]  There you go.
[35:43.690 --> 35:45.130]  Where are they?
[35:46.170 --> 35:46.930]  We're on the highway.
[35:47.410 --> 35:48.690]  Okay, actually, that's perfect.
[35:48.950 --> 35:49.690]  Stay on the highway.
[35:52.010 --> 35:54.570]  Are you guys able to pick us up, or is this going to...
[35:54.570 --> 35:55.490]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:56.030 --> 35:56.310]  No.
[35:57.030 --> 35:57.470]  No.
[35:57.470 --> 35:58.010]  Oh, my God.
[35:59.070 --> 36:01.790]  What the fuck did you just do?
[36:01.850 --> 36:03.050]  What did I just do?
[36:03.270 --> 36:04.410]  What did you do?
[36:04.650 --> 36:06.830]  You parked the vehicle in front of the door.
[36:08.290 --> 36:09.410]  What happened?
[36:10.050 --> 36:12.190]  Andrew blew us up in the...
[36:12.190 --> 36:15.830]  He's like two flying machines in a limousine.
[36:16.230 --> 36:17.350]  He blew us up!
[36:21.490 --> 36:24.870]  Guys, we're driving the whole map here.
[36:24.910 --> 36:25.590]  Come and get us.
[36:25.950 --> 36:28.750]  Yeah, I'm calling my insurance company to replace it.
[36:28.810 --> 36:29.370]  One sec.
[36:31.330 --> 36:34.210]  Fucking Eric, parking a vehicle in front of the thing.
[36:35.250 --> 36:37.350]  Hey, Eric, you just became everything you ever hated.
[36:37.510 --> 36:38.150]  How do you feel right now?
[36:38.170 --> 36:38.730]  Why did you do that?
[36:38.750 --> 36:39.790]  I jumped out of the car.
[36:39.890 --> 36:40.770]  I didn't park it there.
[36:40.950 --> 36:41.770]  Andrew could have moved it.
[36:41.910 --> 36:42.930]  He was so concerned about it.
[36:42.950 --> 36:43.390]  Don't touch it!
[36:43.490 --> 36:43.990]  Blow it!
[36:44.430 --> 36:45.310]  Does it stick to us?
[36:45.750 --> 36:46.070]  No.
[36:46.250 --> 36:46.370]  What?
[36:46.850 --> 36:47.270]  Blow it.
[36:47.290 --> 36:47.390]  See.
[36:51.650 --> 36:52.290]  Holy shit.
[36:52.310 --> 36:53.210]  Oh, my God!
[36:55.970 --> 36:56.290]  Goddamn.
[36:56.430 --> 36:56.990]  That was cool.
[36:57.370 --> 36:58.890]  Oh, we're down a tire.
[36:59.050 --> 36:59.910]  That's what's going on.
[37:00.010 --> 37:00.130]  Okay.
[37:00.490 --> 37:01.230]  Let's get a new one.
[37:01.830 --> 37:02.790]  Guys, come pick us up.
[37:03.210 --> 37:03.610]  Okay.
[37:04.650 --> 37:05.710]  All right, Andrew, hop in.
[37:06.290 --> 37:07.970]  I'm going to order another vehicle.
[37:08.190 --> 37:09.350]  It's the color of snow, baby.
[37:09.510 --> 37:11.590]  I need 30 more seconds and I can order the vehicle.
[37:13.550 --> 37:14.350]  Oh, shit.
[37:15.030 --> 37:16.390]  Sorry, I didn't see you were like a snowman.
[37:16.490 --> 37:16.970]  I didn't even see you there.
[37:16.970 --> 37:17.350]  Yeah, I was blending in.
[37:17.390 --> 37:17.750]  That's fair.
[37:18.010 --> 37:18.850]  Sorry about that.
[37:19.050 --> 37:19.470]  No problem.
[37:20.330 --> 37:21.330]  I get it.
[37:21.630 --> 37:24.570]  Oh, jeez.
[37:27.810 --> 37:28.610]  This one.
[37:28.770 --> 37:29.030]  This one.
[37:29.270 --> 37:29.610]  Stop it.
[37:30.210 --> 37:30.530]  Damn it.
[37:32.950 --> 37:34.010]  All right, hold on.
[37:34.430 --> 37:34.770]  Not that one.
[37:34.870 --> 37:35.230]  It's a Yaris.
[37:35.650 --> 37:39.650]  You know, based on how it reacted to hitting a stationary vehicle at a slow speed.
[37:40.130 --> 37:40.150]  Yeah.
[37:40.190 --> 37:43.030]  We probably weren't successfully landing that thing on the highway.
[37:43.910 --> 37:44.290]  No.
[37:46.330 --> 37:46.830]  Got it.
[37:46.930 --> 37:47.850]  Is this what we're taking?
[37:49.950 --> 37:50.570]  All right.
[37:53.030 --> 37:54.350]  Now that's a new vehicle.
[37:54.470 --> 37:54.790]  Here we go.
[37:56.170 --> 37:56.770]  I'm on my way.
[37:56.870 --> 37:57.810]  Can you get us close to that thing?
[37:58.250 --> 37:58.570]  Which one?
[37:58.810 --> 38:00.150]  The white car straight ahead of us.
[38:01.750 --> 38:02.670]  I'm flooring it.
[38:02.910 --> 38:03.370]  All right.
[38:03.510 --> 38:05.010]  Will it despawn before we get there?
[38:05.790 --> 38:06.790]  That's still on the horizon.
[38:07.470 --> 38:08.050]  Zoom in.
[38:08.150 --> 38:09.050]  Get a sniper and zoom in.
[38:10.730 --> 38:12.070]  I guess you can't snipe.
[38:12.290 --> 38:12.470]  Nope.
[38:13.430 --> 38:13.970]  I'm coming.
[38:14.590 --> 38:15.550]  But I'm aiming at it.
[38:15.610 --> 38:16.230]  I can still see it.
[38:16.450 --> 38:16.910]  Keep it alive.
[38:16.950 --> 38:17.990]  Where did that dude come from?
[38:18.010 --> 38:18.430]  What the hell?
[38:20.010 --> 38:20.890]  Facing the wrong way.
[38:21.090 --> 38:21.710]  Oh, they're bad guys.
[38:24.630 --> 38:25.270]  Okay, guys.
[38:25.290 --> 38:26.010]  I'm taking off.
[38:26.730 --> 38:27.410]  They're an animal.
[38:27.650 --> 38:27.990]  Dog!
[38:35.460 --> 38:39.080]  Whatever that dog was got eaten by this thing.
[38:40.300 --> 38:41.200]  I'm on my way.
[38:41.480 --> 38:43.040]  I think it was a dog.
[38:43.740 --> 38:45.880]  Not like a nice dog, surely.
[38:47.460 --> 38:49.540]  Not like a nice dog, surely?
[38:49.540 --> 38:51.540]  It wasn't like a labrador that got away from someone.
[38:51.740 --> 38:52.520]  Like an evil dog?
[38:53.820 --> 38:56.680]  But it's like some sort of mangy wolf dog.
[38:59.180 --> 39:00.900]  You guys killed a dire wolf?
[39:00.900 --> 39:03.340]  You suck a bit.
[39:03.780 --> 39:04.480]  What's wrong?
[39:05.420 --> 39:07.280]  I'm hearing that missile flying by.
[39:07.300 --> 39:08.080]  What's the matter?
[39:14.340 --> 39:16.260]  Goddamn, it's going to despawn the other way now.
[39:19.600 --> 39:20.640]  It's coming this way.
[39:20.920 --> 39:21.560]  It's coming this way.
[39:21.660 --> 39:22.160]  Kill the driver.
[39:22.280 --> 39:22.720]  Kill the driver.
[39:22.960 --> 39:23.100]  Stop.
[39:24.060 --> 39:24.980]  Guys, I'm coming.
[39:25.700 --> 39:26.260]  He's down.
[39:26.820 --> 39:27.480]  He's down.
[39:27.920 --> 39:28.300]  Kill him.
[39:28.620 --> 39:29.020]  Kill him.
[39:29.040 --> 39:29.360]  He's down.
[39:30.040 --> 39:30.960]  We did it.
[39:30.960 --> 39:31.880]  Ow, my back.
[39:32.420 --> 39:33.420]  He's alive!
[39:35.000 --> 39:35.620]  I got him.
[39:36.400 --> 39:37.420]  Get in the damn car.
[39:39.300 --> 39:40.420]  Goddamn, let's get out of here.
[39:40.500 --> 39:41.360]  Coming down to land.
[39:43.520 --> 39:46.400]  You just desecrated his body.
[39:47.840 --> 39:48.720]  Andrew, where are you at?
[39:48.740 --> 39:49.080]  I don't see you.
[39:49.080 --> 39:49.580]  Coming down to land.
[39:52.260 --> 39:53.180]  Coming from where?
[39:53.760 --> 39:54.160]  The north.
[39:54.160 --> 39:54.380]  Which side?
[39:55.120 --> 39:55.920]  Straight ahead.
[39:56.320 --> 39:57.560]  Which side of the switch lane?
[39:59.360 --> 40:00.860]  You'll see me when you see me.
[40:00.960 --> 40:02.580]  Just pick a goddamn side.
[40:02.880 --> 40:04.900]  Are you landing with traffic or against traffic?
[40:05.020 --> 40:08.680]  I'm landing against traffic, going the opposite direction, so you keep going.
[40:09.440 --> 40:11.120]  Well, about that.
[40:11.400 --> 40:12.160]  Switch sides.
[40:12.700 --> 40:13.340]  Yeah, okay.
[40:13.740 --> 40:14.280]  Switch it.
[40:15.120 --> 40:17.380]  You gotta land with traffic towards us.
[40:17.640 --> 40:18.180]  Oh, God.
[40:18.960 --> 40:19.580]  Oh, God.
[40:20.780 --> 40:22.200]  We got no purchase.
[40:22.560 --> 40:24.000]  Oh, we lost a wheel, that's why.
[40:24.440 --> 40:24.660]  Yeah.
[40:24.960 --> 40:25.920]  We lost all of them.
[40:26.520 --> 40:27.000]  Oh, shit.
[40:29.360 --> 40:29.920]  Or at least one.
[40:30.720 --> 40:31.220]  Uh-oh.
[40:31.540 --> 40:31.940]  Oh, God.
[40:32.820 --> 40:33.060]  Uh-oh.
[40:33.680 --> 40:36.260]  Well, that helped somewhat.
[40:37.820 --> 40:38.840]  Andrew, where are you?
[40:39.600 --> 40:41.960]  I'm just down the road a little bit. I see you on the mini-map.
[40:42.640 --> 40:43.440]  Oh, you landed already?
[40:43.620 --> 40:43.920]  Yeah.
[40:44.500 --> 40:45.180]  Oh, shit.
[40:45.780 --> 40:46.240]  Come on, Gavin.
[40:47.700 --> 40:48.780]  I'm kinda in a hole.
[40:50.400 --> 40:50.760]  Coming.
[40:51.860 --> 40:52.540]  We're on our way.
[40:52.560 --> 40:54.980]  I'm getting out of it. I'm getting out of it. Slowly, but surely.
[41:00.080 --> 41:00.680]  Where is it?
[41:01.260 --> 41:02.600]  Okay, I've held up traffic.
[41:03.320 --> 41:05.080]  Oh, nice. Is it a Titan?
[41:05.580 --> 41:05.840]  Yeah.
[41:06.060 --> 41:07.620]  I'll get in that.
[41:11.680 --> 41:14.400]  Did you bump your mic as the car hit the thing?
[41:16.660 --> 41:18.060]  It was real immersive.
[41:19.220 --> 41:19.980]  I got you.
[41:20.120 --> 41:21.500]  Watch out for the propellers. Jesus.
[41:23.240 --> 41:24.320]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[41:24.540 --> 41:25.580]  How the hell are you gonna take off?
[41:26.180 --> 41:27.400]  You're gonna take off this way?
[41:27.500 --> 41:29.200]  Are you an insane person?
[41:29.200 --> 41:29.380]  Yeah.
[41:32.280 --> 41:33.060]  You know what?
[41:33.960 --> 41:34.380]  Listen.
[41:34.900 --> 41:35.640]  We'll just take the car.
[41:35.900 --> 41:37.020]  Why did you get out?
[41:37.580 --> 41:38.560]  You're gonna blow it up.
[41:38.680 --> 41:39.100]  No, I'm not.
[41:39.100 --> 41:40.260]  You're gonna take off on the straight road.
[41:40.340 --> 41:40.600]  Get in.
[41:43.160 --> 41:44.000]  You fools.
[41:45.160 --> 41:46.820]  You can't take off into rocks.
[41:48.480 --> 41:49.300]  Just trust.
[41:50.200 --> 41:50.500]  Hold on.
[41:50.740 --> 41:51.660]  Okay, here's my trust.
[41:52.600 --> 41:53.920]  Here's my one-time use trust card.
[41:53.920 --> 41:55.280]  Yeah, agree. I'm in.
[41:56.500 --> 41:57.360]  The trust is turned on.
[41:57.360 --> 41:57.740]  One time.
[41:57.860 --> 41:59.120]  No bad ideas, Nick.
[41:59.240 --> 41:59.600]  Jesus.
[42:00.120 --> 42:00.820]  Oh, you know what?
[42:01.080 --> 42:01.740]  No bad ideas.
[42:01.840 --> 42:03.160]  You're hitting that tree several times.
[42:03.180 --> 42:05.240]  Yeah, I'm wiggling it out.
[42:06.080 --> 42:07.940]  This is what happened with the limo earlier.
[42:08.280 --> 42:08.760]  Here we go.
[42:08.840 --> 42:12.140]  And I got that free like I'm getting this free.
[42:12.500 --> 42:14.480]  Oh my god!
[42:14.640 --> 42:15.080]  The wing!
[42:15.600 --> 42:15.920]  Wing!
[42:16.160 --> 42:16.620]  Tree!
[42:17.000 --> 42:17.240]  Wing!
[42:19.180 --> 42:25.040]  I just wanted to let you guys know that he did indeed get that free the same way he got the limo free.
[42:25.040 --> 42:27.760]  Oh, I'm gonna need to call my insurance again.
[42:28.080 --> 42:28.740]  Oh, cool.
[42:29.120 --> 42:30.520]  Andrew's gonna call his insurance again.
[42:30.740 --> 42:32.580]  You guys have to go north and grab that bag.
[42:33.080 --> 42:34.440]  The bag's on the ground?
[42:35.100 --> 42:35.400]  Yeah.
[42:37.960 --> 42:38.660]  Grab the bag.
[42:39.120 --> 42:40.900]  Why is there a snowman just walking?
[42:42.120 --> 42:42.880]  I'll call my insurance.
[42:43.340 --> 42:44.140]  Nick, go a little west.
[42:44.480 --> 42:45.560]  Okay, Andrew's gonna grab the bag.
[42:45.980 --> 42:47.000]  Andrew's got the bag.
[42:47.560 --> 42:48.700]  Alright, come down here, Andrew.
[42:49.640 --> 42:50.040]  Coming.
[42:51.580 --> 42:52.980]  We need to clear some of this traffic.
[42:53.380 --> 42:53.960]  Yeah, you're right.
[42:53.960 --> 42:55.280]  Thank you, Gavin.
[42:55.440 --> 42:56.320]  No, Andrew!
[42:58.860 --> 42:59.940]  Trust me.
[43:03.100 --> 43:04.440]  Let me in this.
[43:05.600 --> 43:05.960]  Get in.
[43:09.900 --> 43:12.340]  I'm just watching your dots on the map.
[43:12.920 --> 43:15.420]  You guys appear to be morons.
[43:15.760 --> 43:16.300]  What happened?
[43:16.560 --> 43:17.380]  My car's on fire!
[43:17.980 --> 43:19.580]  It said I committed suicide somehow.
[43:20.440 --> 43:23.100]  Because you chained... vehicles keep exploding.
[43:23.100 --> 43:24.780]  You set off a chain reaction!
[43:25.080 --> 43:25.380]  Oh, okay.
[43:25.980 --> 43:27.200]  That was quite a long time ago.
[43:27.440 --> 43:27.740]  Jesus!
[43:29.500 --> 43:30.220]  Give me this.
[43:31.960 --> 43:32.500]  Oh, shit!
[43:33.040 --> 43:33.400]  Please!
[43:38.420 --> 43:39.640]  There's too much going on.
[43:42.560 --> 43:44.140]  I need someone to stop.
[43:45.160 --> 43:45.840]  I need this one.
[43:46.000 --> 43:46.420]  Ow!
[43:48.620 --> 43:50.040]  What about this one, Andrew? Or Gavin?
[43:50.900 --> 43:51.240]  This one?
[43:51.640 --> 43:51.860]  Yeah.
[43:51.860 --> 43:52.890]  All about it.
[43:54.560 --> 43:54.980]  Okay.
[43:55.500 --> 43:55.920]  Alright.
[43:56.140 --> 43:57.760]  Got him! Got him! I got one!
[43:58.140 --> 43:58.820]  Alright, get in!
[43:59.140 --> 43:59.580]  That one.
[44:00.200 --> 44:00.660]  Get in your own.
[44:01.460 --> 44:02.040]  I sniped him.
[44:02.400 --> 44:03.140]  I'll let Andrew in that one.
[44:03.920 --> 44:04.560]  Who'd you snipe?
[44:04.820 --> 44:06.060]  The person in this car!
[44:06.840 --> 44:07.100]  Oh.
[44:07.740 --> 44:08.100]  Oh!
[44:08.700 --> 44:09.240]  Get in!
[44:09.940 --> 44:10.520]  Get in!
[44:11.800 --> 44:12.220]  Okay.
[44:13.280 --> 44:14.050]  He's so sad!
[44:15.300 --> 44:15.480]  Oh.
[44:16.240 --> 44:17.680]  He had a pretty fun run there for a bit.
[44:17.980 --> 44:18.520]  2, 3, 4!
[44:18.540 --> 44:18.760]  Ah!
[44:20.340 --> 44:20.760]  Great.
[44:22.460 --> 44:24.220]  I blew another tire!
[44:24.640 --> 44:26.440]  Nick is... oh, Nick.
[44:26.820 --> 44:27.280]  What? What's up?
[44:29.000 --> 44:29.260]  What?
[44:29.960 --> 44:30.920]  I love it.
[44:31.000 --> 44:32.160]  I can just see your dots.
[44:32.440 --> 44:33.140]  Oh, my God.
[44:33.420 --> 44:34.440]  These fucking guys.
[44:35.400 --> 44:35.960]  Oh, no.
[44:36.500 --> 44:37.000]  Oh, no.
[44:37.260 --> 44:37.780]  I got you!
[44:38.060 --> 44:38.700]  Oh, that didn't help.
[44:39.260 --> 44:40.540]  No, you're not helping at all.
[44:40.620 --> 44:41.340]  I gotta stop another car.
[44:41.400 --> 44:41.760]  No, it's okay.
[44:41.840 --> 44:42.060]  It's alright.
[44:42.180 --> 44:42.420]  It's okay.
[44:42.480 --> 44:43.020]  It's alright.
[44:43.880 --> 44:44.640]  How you doing, Gavin?
[44:46.420 --> 44:47.140]  I'm banana.
[44:47.640 --> 44:47.780]  Yeah.
[44:48.880 --> 44:49.280]  Ah!
[44:49.780 --> 44:50.180]  Ah!
[44:51.860 --> 44:53.060]  Stop trying to help me!
[44:53.120 --> 44:53.600]  Oh, you know what?
[44:53.600 --> 44:54.280]  Actually, that helped.
[44:54.760 --> 44:55.140]  Yeah, I know.
[44:55.220 --> 44:55.860]  That's why I'm helping.
[44:57.260 --> 44:57.660]  Sorry!
[44:58.100 --> 44:58.240]  Oh!
[45:01.600 --> 45:03.180]  Taking the duffel bag to the end.
[45:03.880 --> 45:04.720]  Son of a bitch.
[45:05.200 --> 45:05.660]  I can't.
[45:05.720 --> 45:07.020]  We gotta stop that guy.
[45:08.560 --> 45:09.240]  Gotcha, bitch.
[45:09.460 --> 45:09.880]  Who, me?
[45:10.060 --> 45:10.280]  Ah!
[45:11.500 --> 45:12.460]  Andrew Panton died.
[45:13.000 --> 45:13.380]  No, I didn't.
[45:14.060 --> 45:14.460]  Oh.
[45:14.760 --> 45:15.520]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[45:15.760 --> 45:17.960]  I got an old notification when I exited the map.
[45:18.480 --> 45:18.820]  Oh.
[45:19.620 --> 45:20.640]  Wow, that must have been old.
[45:21.060 --> 45:21.540]  It was.
[45:21.600 --> 45:22.620]  I've been watching...
[45:22.620 --> 45:28.700]  My footage for the last few minutes has just been watching three dots circle each other like fucking idiots trying to get this through.
[45:29.020 --> 45:30.180]  It's been really special.
[45:30.400 --> 45:31.880]  Wait, you weren't in the plane that whole time?
[45:33.400 --> 45:33.760]  No.
[45:33.960 --> 45:35.480]  No, I'm watching the map, buddy.
[45:35.660 --> 45:36.580]  Why weren't you in the plane?
[45:36.780 --> 45:37.020]  Yeah.
[45:37.860 --> 45:38.520]  What plane?
[45:38.580 --> 45:39.200]  You were shooting it with rockets.
[45:40.520 --> 45:42.640]  The plane that Andrew hit into a tree and we all blew up in.
[45:43.120 --> 45:45.560]  Why wasn't I in the plane that blew up?
[45:46.200 --> 45:46.420]  Yeah.
[45:46.960 --> 45:49.260]  To be fair, you caused two of the three crashes.
[45:50.300 --> 45:51.460]  Andrew doesn't know how to fly a plane.
[45:52.060 --> 45:54.260]  I mean, I picked up on that, but...
[45:54.260 --> 45:57.800]  Oh my god, Andrew, Jesus, what are you doing?
[45:58.180 --> 45:59.660]  He missed the exit.
[46:01.440 --> 46:01.840]  Shortcut.
[46:03.940 --> 46:05.340]  He jumped over the railings?
[46:07.340 --> 46:07.980]  Ah, shit.
[46:08.340 --> 46:08.640]  Shortcut.
[46:08.780 --> 46:09.940]  What happened? Did you miss the exit too?
[46:10.700 --> 46:11.680]  I got wedged in it.
[46:12.600 --> 46:13.760]  Between two stumps.
[46:14.540 --> 46:14.780]  Shit.
[46:21.460 --> 46:22.300]  Quick review of that.
[46:25.870 --> 46:26.670]  Duffel bag.
[46:31.170 --> 46:32.750]  He did it!
[46:32.770 --> 46:33.490]  We did it!
[46:35.290 --> 46:37.810]  Against the odds, Andrew delivers the duffel.
[46:40.630 --> 46:42.710]  Thank god we stayed behind as long as we did.
[46:43.850 --> 46:45.530]  Daily nightclub cake has increased.
[46:45.930 --> 46:46.070]  Nice.
[46:46.810 --> 46:47.270]  Ah!
[46:48.510 --> 46:53.230]  Oh, that's right. I laid down some proximity mines over there.
[46:53.330 --> 46:54.310]  Yeah, you sure did.
[46:55.870 --> 46:58.430]  I didn't want anyone to follow you in, you know?
[46:58.650 --> 47:00.170]  Oh yeah, it worked great.
[47:00.550 --> 47:01.190]  I got worried.
[47:02.330 --> 47:04.070]  Oh, that's a punch in the face.
[47:08.320 --> 47:08.780]  Woo!
[47:14.000 --> 47:17.040]  Alright, well I guess we're all together again so we can just get a plane or something.
[47:18.040 --> 47:19.400]  Prep riot control van.
[47:20.460 --> 47:26.540]  I mean, if Andrew knew how to call and get the right kind of flying vehicle, yeah, absolutely. I think that'd be a really great idea.
[47:26.620 --> 47:27.280]  I'm requesting one.
[47:28.700 --> 47:29.640]  Let's do it for him.
[47:30.240 --> 47:30.760]  Yeah, got it.
[47:31.140 --> 47:31.840]  Okay, nice job.
[47:32.720 --> 47:33.560]  There's the chopper.
[47:35.220 --> 47:37.640]  And now we can go together! Yay!
[47:38.280 --> 47:38.780]  Everyone get in.
[47:39.020 --> 47:39.640]  I want fire!
[47:39.960 --> 47:41.100]  Why are you on fire?
[47:41.260 --> 47:45.660]  You guys fly that, I'll fly the other plane so we have a backup air vehicle just in case.
[47:45.660 --> 47:47.160]  You want to not be in this?
[47:47.700 --> 47:49.380]  I want to be in that, let me in that.
[47:49.460 --> 47:50.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:51.860 --> 47:54.720]  We seem to have a tendency to explode with the plane, so...
[47:56.060 --> 47:56.500]  Okay, let's go.
[47:58.400 --> 47:59.620]  I gotta see what this...
[47:59.620 --> 48:01.560]  Go to the hippy camp, baby. Southeast.
[48:03.960 --> 48:05.680]  Hippy camp, is that where the dick guys are?
[48:08.820 --> 48:12.480]  Oh, that looks nice.
[48:15.220 --> 48:16.520]  Yeah, let's all fly together.
[48:16.980 --> 48:17.380]  Yeah.
[48:23.260 --> 48:24.720]  Oh no, don't shoot us down!
[48:26.500 --> 48:27.740]  Stop trying to shoot me!
[48:28.820 --> 48:29.480]  Don't keep running.
[48:31.560 --> 48:32.640]  Don't worry about us.
[48:33.860 --> 48:35.140]  I'm very worried about you.
[48:36.080 --> 48:37.780]  I'm going to cam you taken off, it's going to look good.
[48:38.160 --> 48:39.780]  There's a dude on the beach, kill him!
[48:39.940 --> 48:40.380]  Who's that?
[48:41.020 --> 48:41.660]  Some guy.
[48:41.920 --> 48:43.120]  Don't kill him, he's next to me!
[48:46.440 --> 48:47.460]  No survivors!
[48:47.460 --> 48:48.160]  Let's kill this prick!
[48:50.600 --> 48:52.300]  Come here, you bastard!
[48:53.340 --> 48:55.460]  Oh my god, that guy's going to be like...
[48:56.760 --> 48:58.560]  Come here! Come here!
[48:58.840 --> 48:59.760]  I missed him!
[49:00.280 --> 49:06.220]  Oh my god.
[49:06.520 --> 49:07.080]  He's wily.
[49:07.420 --> 49:07.920]  Where'd he go?
[49:08.160 --> 49:08.560]  Hold on.
[49:09.860 --> 49:10.660]  Did I hit him?
[49:11.760 --> 49:13.000]  How the hell is he alive?
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.020]  Oh, he's like right in front of us.
[49:15.300 --> 49:15.820]  Alright.
[49:18.020 --> 49:19.460]  He's beeping at us.
[49:19.760 --> 49:20.780]  Alright, follow Andrew!
[49:23.240 --> 49:25.100]  You're a fucking idiot.
[49:25.580 --> 49:26.840]  You're so dumb.
[49:27.160 --> 49:28.600]  You're so dumb.
[49:29.140 --> 49:30.580]  How did you do that?
[49:36.220 --> 49:39.240]  There's no one to blame but you, that's so awesome.
[49:39.580 --> 49:41.160]  That was so awesome.
[49:41.360 --> 49:41.940]  I need help!
[49:43.360 --> 49:43.800]  Emergency!
[49:44.720 --> 49:46.580]  You want us to fly in this with no backup?
[49:46.900 --> 49:47.100]  Yup!
[49:48.580 --> 49:51.020]  Oh shit, I can't believe you did that.
[49:51.720 --> 49:52.160]  Fuck.
[49:52.640 --> 49:53.220]  There's my flare.
[49:53.220 --> 49:54.000]  Oh my god, dude.
[49:54.240 --> 49:55.640]  How did you do that?
[49:55.760 --> 49:56.620]  What happened?
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.180]  I was skidding the beach and then you guys decided to try to hit him with your vehicle.
[50:02.460 --> 50:03.080]  Yeah, that's right.
[50:03.280 --> 50:05.700]  Oh yeah, man, I can't believe we fucked you up so bad.
[50:05.780 --> 50:06.220]  That sucks.
[50:06.220 --> 50:08.940]  And then I tried to swerve back down and...
[50:09.740 --> 50:10.960]  Yeah, the train!
[50:11.660 --> 50:13.100]  I wanna save some fuel.
[50:14.880 --> 50:16.380]  Well, if I get out, I'll die.
[50:18.760 --> 50:19.480]  So Andrew can get out.
[50:19.480 --> 50:20.060]  Andrew got out.
[50:20.760 --> 50:21.840]  He's gonna steal the train.
[50:22.060 --> 50:23.280]  Andrew, go talk to the conductor.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.320]  Yeah, make this thing speed up a little.
[50:28.320 --> 50:29.000]  Speed up!
[50:30.360 --> 50:30.760]  Faster!
[50:32.980 --> 50:33.940]  Uh, he's dead.
[50:34.380 --> 50:34.820]  He's dead.
[50:35.020 --> 50:35.280]  Guys?
[50:35.540 --> 50:35.940]  Guys?
[50:37.940 --> 50:39.200]  We gotta get off the train.
[50:39.200 --> 50:40.020]  You better hurry up.
[50:40.020 --> 50:41.320]  We gotta get off this train.
[50:41.820 --> 50:42.720]  You better hurry up.
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.540]  We do have to take off pretty quick here.
[50:44.700 --> 50:46.440]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, go!
[50:46.840 --> 50:48.000]  Oh my god!
[50:48.500 --> 50:50.340]  Alright, it's a chopper, we can just go straight up.
[50:50.520 --> 50:50.960]  Wow!
[50:52.620 --> 50:53.500]  That's pretty cool.
[50:55.220 --> 50:58.260]  People will be so confused as to why that train driver was dead.
[50:59.740 --> 51:01.340]  Sorry, one second, I gotta call insurance.
[51:02.460 --> 51:04.620]  Dude, this guy cannot stop calling insurance.
[51:05.720 --> 51:07.420]  He's Moore's Mutual's best customer.
[51:09.240 --> 51:10.420]  Or worst, I guess.
[51:11.660 --> 51:12.060]  Whoa!
[51:13.420 --> 51:14.260]  Nick, what was that?
[51:14.680 --> 51:15.460]  That was not me!
[51:17.260 --> 51:18.160]  Damn this snow.
[51:18.460 --> 51:20.540]  I know why you think it was, but it wasn't.
[51:20.860 --> 51:21.940]  I can't see anything.
[51:22.340 --> 51:23.480]  No, there's nothing here.
[51:23.740 --> 51:24.200]  Go lower.
[51:24.820 --> 51:26.120]  Just keep flying straight and true.
[51:26.320 --> 51:27.520]  No, up, up, pull up!
[51:28.040 --> 51:28.960]  Oh, Nick said go low.
[51:29.200 --> 51:30.880]  Don't ever listen to Nick!
[51:31.120 --> 51:32.020]  No, always listen to Nick.
[51:33.260 --> 51:34.320]  Okay, go higher now.
[51:35.540 --> 51:35.860]  Right now?
[51:38.380 --> 51:39.600]  Are those the windmills?
[51:40.960 --> 51:43.080]  Is our mark on the other side of this?
[51:47.460 --> 51:48.420]  Oh no.
[51:48.760 --> 51:49.480]  Ah, what was that?
[51:49.660 --> 51:50.140]  Goddamn!
[51:51.220 --> 51:52.880]  Did someone electrocute me?
[51:52.920 --> 51:53.340]  What's happened?
[51:53.600 --> 51:53.720]  What?
[51:54.300 --> 51:55.420]  Have I EMPed?
[51:55.540 --> 51:55.840]  What?
[51:56.420 --> 51:57.660]  What are you doing?
[51:57.800 --> 51:58.200]  What do you mean?
[51:58.540 --> 51:59.920]  What's someone doing to me?
[52:00.500 --> 52:01.920]  Is this a part of the game?
[52:02.140 --> 52:02.900]  Pull up!
[52:03.280 --> 52:04.540]  What are you doing?
[52:05.700 --> 52:06.740]  Who did that?
[52:07.420 --> 52:08.600]  I don't have a parachute!
[52:10.860 --> 52:12.400]  Are these bad guys?
[52:12.520 --> 52:13.180]  It's your gas now.
[52:15.820 --> 52:17.240]  Oh, why'd you blow it all up?
[52:18.660 --> 52:20.180]  Oh, Nick doesn't read.
[52:20.320 --> 52:21.260]  Don't kill him.
[52:28.380 --> 52:31.340]  Get back to the base and start that all over again.
[52:32.500 --> 52:34.380]  Good god damn.
[52:35.720 --> 52:36.420]  Get in, son.
[52:38.140 --> 52:39.020]  Andrew, get in.
[52:40.200 --> 52:40.640]  Okay.
[52:41.300 --> 52:42.180]  Fly me back.
[52:43.360 --> 52:44.640]  Everyone's trying to kill me.
[52:46.100 --> 52:46.840]  Quickly get in.
[52:46.840 --> 52:47.260]  I'm trying!
[52:47.260 --> 52:47.960]  Get in quickly.
[52:48.860 --> 52:49.720]  I'm not doing a bit.
[52:56.810 --> 52:58.310]  Does someone want to stay back there?
[52:59.690 --> 53:00.730]  You got it!
[53:03.610 --> 53:04.750]  Pull the parachute, rat!
[53:04.950 --> 53:05.410]  There we go.
[53:05.410 --> 53:14.110]  Now, I will say I have a four-star wanted level, so I don't know how back here it's going to keep me, but we'll see.
[53:16.390 --> 53:19.190]  What happened with the chopper? Why did it go EMP? Who did that?
[53:19.410 --> 53:20.430]  That was crazy.
[53:21.670 --> 53:23.170]  Could everyone see it go blue?
[53:23.370 --> 53:23.610]  Yes.
[53:23.730 --> 53:23.790]  No.
[53:24.070 --> 53:24.370]  Oh, okay.
[53:28.820 --> 53:30.300]  Yeah, well, it got rid of our wanted level.
[53:31.980 --> 53:32.840]  How'd you do that?
[53:33.100 --> 53:33.680]  Cold blaster.
[53:34.420 --> 53:35.600]  Oh, is that all you have to do?
[53:35.820 --> 53:36.060]  Yep.
[53:36.840 --> 53:37.420]  What do you do?
[53:37.420 --> 53:38.720]  You go to contacts and you call Lester?
[53:40.040 --> 53:42.600]  Someone's been shockingly quiet since they failed the mission.
[53:44.200 --> 53:45.120]  I didn't fail it.
[53:45.880 --> 53:47.120]  I didn't even pull the trigger.
[53:47.840 --> 53:48.440]  Oh, you didn't?
[53:48.640 --> 53:48.940]  No!
[53:50.120 --> 53:52.600]  Archie came in here and was showing me something, and now I muted myself for a minute.
[53:52.600 --> 53:55.700]  I heard Archie, and then all of a sudden, a missile went off.
[53:56.200 --> 53:56.400]  Nope.
[53:56.580 --> 53:57.500]  Did not fire a missile?
[53:57.800 --> 53:58.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[54:01.880 --> 54:03.640]  So, uh, so who did it?
[54:04.720 --> 54:06.660]  I think we literally just said I did it.
[54:06.660 --> 54:08.480]  I think you gotta kick your kid out of the room, bud.
[54:09.260 --> 54:09.620]  Who?
[54:10.560 --> 54:12.680]  And then, Eric, are you EMPing me as well?
[54:12.880 --> 54:14.060]  No, that was not me.
[54:14.140 --> 54:14.720]  I think that was Andrew.
[54:14.720 --> 54:16.360]  Well, you're taking us out to sea.
[54:17.480 --> 54:18.400]  I can't fly.
[54:23.020 --> 54:24.520]  Why did you keep doing that?
[54:26.920 --> 54:27.600]  Who's doing it?
[54:27.600 --> 54:28.540]  I don't even know what this is.
[54:28.600 --> 54:29.560]  I don't know what's happening to me.
[54:30.880 --> 54:32.000]  Andrew, what is that?
[54:32.140 --> 54:33.460]  I don't know what this is.
[54:34.740 --> 54:35.820]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[54:37.680 --> 54:38.600]  I'm just sitting.
[54:40.420 --> 54:41.620]  Sit in my ass.
[54:42.460 --> 54:43.880]  Well, you do sit on your ass.
[54:44.980 --> 54:46.440]  That's wild that Eric did that.
[54:46.760 --> 54:46.980]  Yeah.
[54:47.320 --> 54:50.160]  With a hard out on this video.
[54:50.160 --> 54:51.820]  Where are you taking us?
[54:52.560 --> 54:53.740]  I'm going to your bunker, aren't I?
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.320]  No, you're on the fucking moon!
[55:01.620 --> 55:05.660]  You're so far. Gavin, you are so far.
[55:05.660 --> 55:08.720]  Well, I'm going to sit him up because I'm the NPC.
[55:09.600 --> 55:11.060]  That is so insane.
[55:11.500 --> 55:13.300]  That is so crazy, dude.
[55:13.520 --> 55:15.920]  I was like, I was just flying towards the end.
[55:19.360 --> 55:20.900]  Why did I go out?
[55:21.480 --> 55:21.780]  Did you keep me out?
[55:21.780 --> 55:22.620]  I don't know why.
[55:22.840 --> 55:23.620]  Why did you go out?
[55:23.700 --> 55:25.300]  Andrew's playing silly bollocks.
[55:28.120 --> 55:30.160]  Are you playing silly bollocks?
[55:30.220 --> 55:31.200]  We're going to swim.
[55:32.060 --> 55:32.980]  Six years.
[55:33.420 --> 55:34.500]  We're going to the beach.
[55:35.660 --> 55:36.840]  Leave a hard out.
[55:37.040 --> 55:39.200]  You have so far to go before you get there.
[55:39.220 --> 55:40.580]  Where the hell are you?
[55:41.300 --> 55:44.460]  I'm down by over where the mission happens.
[55:44.760 --> 55:45.400]  So that way...
[55:45.400 --> 55:47.000]  How do you keep ending up where we need to be?
[55:47.660 --> 55:52.000]  I jumped out when we all had the conversation that someone should stay over here.
[55:53.420 --> 55:54.560]  Oh my God.
[55:55.620 --> 55:58.080]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[55:59.480 --> 56:00.620]  What are you doing?
[56:00.960 --> 56:02.300]  You're shocking the fool.
[56:02.660 --> 56:03.440]  What am I doing?
[56:06.960 --> 56:08.720]  He's going further and further.
[56:11.520 --> 56:13.200]  Guys, I don't think you're going to make it.
[56:15.100 --> 56:15.900]  Gavin, no.
[56:16.940 --> 56:17.960]  I'm not going to swim.
[56:18.160 --> 56:18.720]  Are you crazy?
[56:19.300 --> 56:20.920]  There's nothing in front of us but ocean.
[56:22.040 --> 56:23.280]  I couldn't see the map.
[56:23.560 --> 56:24.720]  I was getting electrocuted.
[56:30.020 --> 56:32.100]  You were farting my stick all around.
[56:32.260 --> 56:33.240]  I couldn't see what the hell I'm doing.
[56:37.900 --> 56:39.400]  How do I die?
[56:40.360 --> 56:41.280]  There we go.
[56:41.980 --> 56:43.140]  Oh my God.
[56:43.980 --> 56:46.980]  But it doesn't matter. Andrew's the only one that can start it.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.120]  Yeah, I need to drown.
[56:51.500 --> 56:53.700]  Eric, how are you already where we need to be?
[56:58.160 --> 56:59.440]  Oh my God.
[57:01.780 --> 57:05.520]  No, I surfaced and lived. God damn it.
[57:09.340 --> 57:10.780]  Andrew refuses to drown.
[57:10.980 --> 57:11.460]  Andrew.
[57:11.840 --> 57:14.260]  I had scuba gear.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.560]  Alright, I stand by my statement.
[57:18.020 --> 57:19.980]  You drowned yourself with an oxygen tank.
[57:20.160 --> 57:20.480]  Yeah.
[57:21.800 --> 57:23.400]  I just ran out of oxygen.
[57:23.980 --> 57:25.300]  Now I'm starting to suffocate.
[57:25.600 --> 57:27.260]  Where did you get scuba gear from?
[57:29.140 --> 57:30.600]  I stored it in the chopper.
[57:31.560 --> 57:37.020]  I should have been suspicious when the guy in the chopper next to me while we're over the ocean is getting dressed in scuba gear.
[57:39.900 --> 57:44.160]  Nobody, no rational person would think you'd continue to go into the ocean.
[57:44.540 --> 57:46.040]  You just kept going. That was pretty crazy.
[57:46.480 --> 57:49.120]  I mean, he lost control, so he had to keep going.
[57:49.360 --> 57:49.900]  No, he didn't.
[57:49.920 --> 57:53.300]  He was distracted by the propellers. The row was slowing down.
[57:53.800 --> 57:56.300]  I shocked him so long ago.
[57:57.160 --> 58:02.140]  I had nothing to do with that crash or him fucking flying to New York.
[58:02.820 --> 58:05.280]  You know what I was thinking when we were going that way?
[58:05.280 --> 58:07.360]  I was like, man, this lake is big.
[58:09.060 --> 58:10.480]  Yeah, the ocean is a big ass lake.
[58:10.480 --> 58:12.040]  I was like, where's the other side of the lake at?
[58:13.340 --> 58:14.660]  Oh, God, that was funny.
[58:22.840 --> 58:24.220]  Between that and these empanadas.
[58:25.320 --> 58:28.640]  I'm so sick of hearing about your empanadas.
[58:30.260 --> 58:33.440]  You've brought up your empanadas like six times and you don't even know what they are.
[58:36.080 --> 58:37.280]  Delicious is what they are.
[58:39.640 --> 58:41.300]  Alright, I've got a helicopter.
[58:42.640 --> 58:43.880]  Hey, here's the train.
[58:44.300 --> 58:45.200]  Okay, I'm at the bunker.
[58:45.960 --> 58:46.960]  The driver might be...
[58:46.960 --> 58:49.460]  Yeah, he might be back now out of commission.
[58:51.380 --> 58:52.700]  Are you starting it?
[58:53.140 --> 58:54.120]  I'm going in.
[58:54.880 --> 58:59.440]  When I blamed Nick for shooting the rocket that Eric fired, I said, Nick doesn't read.
[58:59.720 --> 59:02.900]  And then I shot one of the hippies in the face and that's what ended it.
[59:02.900 --> 59:03.580]  Yep.
[59:04.680 --> 59:06.800]  So it was everybody's fault but mine.
[59:07.220 --> 59:07.400]  Yep.
[59:07.740 --> 59:09.860]  There you go, man. First time for everything.
[59:10.720 --> 59:14.660]  Well, that's not true. I feel like Gavin made us fail a lot in the last video.
[59:15.640 --> 59:16.740]  Yeah, but this time I'm back seat.
[59:17.580 --> 59:18.220]  Are you?
[59:18.720 --> 59:19.520]  Is that why you're flying?
[59:21.760 --> 59:23.240]  I might be front seat in this.
[59:24.780 --> 59:25.740]  How's the train, Eric?
[59:26.120 --> 59:27.400]  Oh, it's gone.
[59:29.920 --> 59:30.820]  Here we go.
[59:37.530 --> 59:38.030]  Okay.
[59:38.470 --> 59:39.990]  It's a different spot.
[59:40.210 --> 59:41.950]  It's a different fucking spot!
[59:45.830 --> 59:47.590]  I'm in the middle of nowhere!
[59:52.570 --> 59:54.350]  I'm in the middle of nowhere!
[59:54.910 --> 59:55.770]  Oh, God.
[59:56.470 --> 59:58.610]  Hey, this is Sanders Motorcycles.
[59:59.010 --> 01:00:00.370]  Just go there.
[01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.230]  What are you gonna do?
[01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:04.570]  Get a car and meet you there.
[01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:11.690]  Honestly, when this rolls into 4 o'clock, we'll just go live with whatever this is and that can be the stream.
[01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:12.590]  Sure.
[01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:16.110]  I'm gonna get a beer for the stream.
[01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.010]  Oh my God, the stream starts in 24 minutes.
[01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:21.370]  Holy shit.
[01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.030]  I don't own any beer.
[01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:23.590]  Really?
[01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:28.050]  I picked up a 12er for the holidays.
[01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:29.670]  What is it?
[01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.510]  It's just a Shiner Cheer.
[01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:32.830]  I thought so.
[01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.170]  I can't think if I had beer this year at all.
[01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:35.830]  Nice.
[01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:37.310]  I could have been beerless.
[01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:40.030]  You got a few days left.
[01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:42.050]  That's true.
[01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:44.670]  So we did the snowman thing
[01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:46.190]  like a day or two ago.
[01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:47.050]  Yesterday?
[01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.690]  Yeah, Boxing Day.
[01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:52.630]  Oh, who was fighting?
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.520]  Remember that dog, Gavin?
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.720]  I heard it was a bad dog.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.240]  Some kind of wolf hound or something.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.000]  What's funny is that when I landed this chopper
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.200]  waiting for Nick, there was a
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.940]  like a black Labrador.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.240]  Like a vile dog.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.240]  That one was probably sweet.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.660]  Like a vile hound.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.880]  Why did you bring up, remember when we did that
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.080]  Yeah, I was gonna continue my point
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.660]  and then Nick made a joke and I was just like
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.620]  I'm throwing in the towel.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.520]  I was gonna say
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.000]  that Nick missed it
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.860]  and it's a seasonal event.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.440]  Do you think GTA 6
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.160]  online will be available
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.280]  by the time this runs around
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:39.760]  next year?
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.380]  Or will Nick get another chance
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.020]  at getting it?
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.540]  I think Nick's gonna get another crack at it.
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.860]  I agree, I do not think
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.100]  GTA Online 6 will be
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.300]  available
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.840]  this time next year.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.460]  But aren't the snowmen still in it?
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.140]  We'll see.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.360]  Next year?
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.060]  No, I mean now.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.420]  Yeah, but...
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:04.980]  No killing.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.360]  I totally
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.700]  understand what you're saying, Andrew.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.180]  This isn't obtuse at all.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.540]  Alright, get the tear gas in.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.140]  I'm gonna land?
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.060]  Do we have to land for you to throw tear gas?
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:18.820]  I think so.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.460]  I'm cycling, I'm trying to find it.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.600]  You have to hit Y.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.280]  We're on the ground.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.220]  Oh, there's tear gas.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.580]  I thought maybe you were in the helicopter.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:30.840]  That's for you.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.040]  Oh, it's fist fight.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:34.860]  We gotta fight them.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.140]  They're fighting each other, hell yeah.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.600]  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.580]  Security guard!
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.500]  Oh, Christ.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.020]  I'm just...
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.540]  I'm in the middle of an absolute
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.400]  scuffle here.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:55.720]  Ow.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:57.720]  Oh!
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.060]  You hit me! Ow, you hit me again!
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.400]  We're in each other's path.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.940]  Just beating the shit out of each other.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.480]  Oh, my strength went up.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:11.400]  Cool.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.280]  You're so strong.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.860]  You punched me, you son of a bitch.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.180]  Punching heads.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:17.260]  Alright.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.860]  Oh, they're shooting from the water!
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:22.600]  It's got water.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.540]  Get out, son.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.020]  Alright.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.020]  Oh, that sucks.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.300]  Drive the truck!
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.500]  Get washed, you losers.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.640]  They're coming for us.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:35.460]  Rat!
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.140]  Why are they after me?
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.180]  I didn't do anything!
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.600]  Wait, Eric's here.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.480]  Were you just in the thick of it?
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.480]  Yeah, why are they hitting me?
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.540]  You can't go over that very tiny ridge.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:55.920]  Shit.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.540]  Are we going to deliver this to the thing?
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:58.940]  Just go!
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.760]  To the facility.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:03.900]  To the facility.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.200]  Who the fuck keeps spinning this thing in circles?
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.440]  I got the line after I was turning the other way.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.920]  How are you guys still there?
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.840]  We went around in circles for like two minutes.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.140]  Well, first I was trying to wash people.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.560]  Then I was trying to turn around.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.520]  Why were you trying to wash people?
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.560]  Gavin, straight ahead!
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.500]  You know it.
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.300]  That was great.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.100]  That was fantastic. Way to go.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.380]  That was better than hitting the police and getting a wanted level.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.220]  We have a wanted level.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:44.980]  Oh, do you?
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:45.920]  I don't.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.880]  How do I have a wanted level and you don't?
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.480]  I'm not doing anything.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.480]  I'm not attacking them.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.080]  What do you got, Nick?
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.580]  Nick can't believe the consequences of his actions.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.600]  Yeah, so I paid to have them removed.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.400]  I wish we could make ice with the water.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.980]  That would be so cool.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:10.980]  That would be so cool if it was like that episode of Tom and Jerry where they freeze up all the kitchen.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.920]  I was just thinking that.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.100]  Oh, sorry.
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:16.940]  Another motorcycle!
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.020]  Oh, shit. I'll go on the other side.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.360]  Oh, there's one! No escape!
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.040]  Not that one, though.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.940]  Oh, boy. It's a long drive up there, huh?
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.000]  Oh, my!
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.420]  I thought you were about to say, over road.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:37.700]  This is nice.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.340]  Did we kill Eric when we ran him over?
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.440]  Eric's shooting at us from a helicopter.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.100]  It's perfect.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:47.940]  Oh, that's him?
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.640]  Did you get in the chopper?
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.720]  He's directly behind us.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.640]  Oh, yeah, he did!
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:54.420]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.980]  I bet you can't land on this thing.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.680]  Come land on us!
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:04.820]  Oh, man.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.640]  Eric's singing the Casualty Season 3 song.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:11.920]  Casualty!
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:13.680]  Casualty!
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.240]  Oh, my God!
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.480]  I'm putting out the fires that he's making. Don't worry.
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:21.560]  Merry Christmas!
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.780]  Putting it out.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.860]  That was a nice shot.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:27.840]  Thank you.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:29.260]  Oh, you're locking on, though, aren't you?
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.120]  No, I'm not.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.300]  Oh, no! The helicopter!
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.300]  Oh, dear.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.530]  Oh, well, that's that problem removed.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.980]  Is that a cyclist going up the hill?
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:42.680]  Yeah.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:45.840]  Oh!
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.680]  Oh, you landed on him!
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.140]  I wondered where he went.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:57.120]  Well, he's a fine paste now.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.560]  I also like the casual
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.280]  beep, beep, beep
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.520]  backing up after that.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:04.540]  Oh, the
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:05.860]  helicopter's on fire. Uh-oh.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.160]  We'll put it out. Come here.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.460]  Oh, no. The reason it's on fire
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.260]  is because it stopped working and crashed.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.560]  Damn shame.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:15.980]  Car wash.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.060]  Are you controlling the back one?
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.340]  Yep. Car wash.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.120]  Oh, God. His window is down.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.580]  Oh, why are you swerving off the road?
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.760]  Free car wash.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.420]  Big old tank.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.420]  I was thinking about that earlier.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.300]  Imagine if cars could run out of gas
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:33.820]  in this game.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.460]  Just how annoying it would be
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.760]  if you had to stop and refill.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.820]  Be a bit too realistic, I think.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.540]  Yeah. Being near the end
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.560]  of a heist and your car running out of gas.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:47.700]  Oh, we
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.660]  failed that one heist again because of it.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.260]  Oh, there's a deer.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.260]  Be cool if this thing could shoot blood.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.680]  Can we spritz the deer? Oh, God!
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.600]  Oh, shit.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.380]  We have to get this somewhere.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.360]  I don't
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.340]  know.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:09.760]  Eric, we
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.740]  might need a cargo bob.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.760]  Oh, no, no. There's a hill.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.960]  There's a hill. We can do it.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.320]  Well...
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.460]  Oh, God.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.240]  Oh, you went behind it?
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.800]  I don't know what he was doing.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.300]  Trying to jump the wall.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.460]  But we need this above the wall.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.500]  Yeah, I was going to get a vehicle to push you.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.240]  Oh, okay. Do you want to get it again?
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.220]  No, I'll get a vehicle.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:38.760]  Let's go.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.040]  We got a stream.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.180]  We're so close.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.160]  Oh, you made it.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.040]  Well, what a worthless detour
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:49.460]  I took.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.340]  Yeah, we were already out when we were talking to you about it.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:52.920]  You were?
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.120]  Yeah, I just reversed out.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:56.380]  Oh.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.000]  I thought you knew that and were agreeing
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.640]  that we should just go when he said,
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.600]  do you want to get in?
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.320]  Oh, you know what? It all checks out now.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.320]  Oh, God.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.280]  Man, I'm making bank being in this
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.040]  organization.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.780]  How many shortcuts is that, you think?
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.120]  Maybe like a
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.180]  30 second of one.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:22.480]  Oops.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.080]  Did you miss the turn?
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:27.980]  Yeah, I did.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.100]  Cool.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:32.180]  You can water the
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.300]  lawn as we go by.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.700]  Oh, nice roll.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:39.580]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:41.660]  Okay.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.500]  Uh-oh, you're tipping. I can help.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.940]  Oh my God, it slowed me down.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.940]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.220]  I'm a big lump there.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.380]  It's like you're actively pushing me backwards.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.000]  Go forward, Gavin.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.480]  Yeah, we're so close.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.300]  I know, but I'm watching him.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.840]  You dirty truck.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.140]  Oh, we're gonna
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:10.700]  solidify his cement.
[01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:21.790]  We did it.
[01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.950]  We did it.
[01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.110]  Way to go, team.
[01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:26.470]  We all did it equally.
[01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:27.850]  Yep.
[01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:30.370]  Well, does that mean we're
[01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:31.630]  prepped for the heist or what?
[01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:34.770]  We got one more prep to do, but that will be next time.
[01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:38.090]  When we do more heist stuff.
[01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:41.430]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:44.670]  I was waiting for anyone else to say anything.
[01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:45.930]  You were already talking.
[01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.110]  Why wouldn't you do the outro?
[01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:50.070]  I did a little pause to see if anyone was gonna interject
[01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:52.250]  or maybe some witty banter. You guys are pretty funny,
[01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:54.430]  but not today, I guess. So watch our
[01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:55.250]  next video.
[01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:57.610]  Did you spawn here?
[01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.590]  Bye.
[01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:00.830]  Bye!
