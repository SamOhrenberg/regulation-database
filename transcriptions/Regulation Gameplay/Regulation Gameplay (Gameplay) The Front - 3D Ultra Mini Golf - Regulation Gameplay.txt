[00:00.000 --> 00:01.400]  Oh my god, we're doing it.
[00:01.520 --> 00:02.100]  We're at the beach!
[00:03.220 --> 00:04.420]  We're the snakes!
[00:05.660 --> 00:06.580]  Geoff, what are we doing?
[00:06.920 --> 00:10.440]  Uh, today we are playing 3D Ultra Mini Golf again.
[00:10.800 --> 00:14.600]  This time, we are gonna play some DLC that was really easy to get to.
[00:15.160 --> 00:17.720]  Yeah, yeah, it was easy and fun to get to. This is good.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.120]  There's nothing hard about it.
[00:19.480 --> 00:19.640]  Nope.
[00:19.740 --> 00:22.920]  You can no longer purchase this with your console, it turns out.
[00:24.120 --> 00:24.920]  Uh, okay.
[00:25.320 --> 00:28.500]  I mean, it is crazy to think, like, when you're playing the 360,
[00:28.500 --> 00:33.240]  telling yourself in 2025, you would be downloading DLC for it.
[00:33.260 --> 00:33.420]  Yeah.
[00:33.520 --> 00:34.760]  It is crazy to think of.
[00:34.760 --> 00:35.120]  Crazy.
[00:37.660 --> 00:39.040]  What year was the 360 out?
[00:40.000 --> 00:40.220]  Uh...
[00:40.220 --> 00:40.820]  2005?
[00:41.340 --> 00:41.420]  Oh, fuck!
[00:43.180 --> 00:43.620]  What?
[00:43.900 --> 00:45.280]  Oh, it's right in front of me!
[00:45.840 --> 00:46.780]  Why'd you do that?
[00:47.020 --> 00:47.700]  I didn't mean to.
[00:49.260 --> 00:50.140]  I can't...
[00:50.140 --> 00:51.660]  You both, there's nowhere to go.
[00:52.460 --> 00:54.280]  You fucked all of us, dude.
[00:55.340 --> 00:56.740]  So I guess I should just go for the whale now.
[00:56.740 --> 00:58.180]  Bouncing off that right wall into the whale.
[00:58.500 --> 00:59.480]  Yeah, you might as well.
[00:59.620 --> 01:00.340]  Ripple effect!
[01:00.860 --> 01:01.460]  You might as whale.
[01:02.460 --> 01:03.020]  There you go.
[01:03.760 --> 01:04.000]  Whoa!
[01:04.540 --> 01:05.700]  Oh, so close.
[01:06.640 --> 01:07.120]  Oopsie!
[01:07.840 --> 01:08.180]  Uh-oh.
[01:08.380 --> 01:09.560]  Gavin's got attitude.
[01:14.460 --> 01:16.220]  You really fucked us, Jack.
[01:16.220 --> 01:17.520]  You got a whole day down, huh?
[01:18.180 --> 01:19.120]  Don't let it go.
[01:19.500 --> 01:22.660]  All right, a little, just a little shy on that one.
[01:23.100 --> 01:24.000]  Yeah, I'm going to be bold.
[01:24.400 --> 01:26.180]  So glad to be watching him not play.
[01:26.360 --> 01:27.140]  Here we go.
[01:27.740 --> 01:28.720]  Oh, that's smart.
[01:29.680 --> 01:30.680]  Using your angles.
[01:31.200 --> 01:32.060]  Shaw shit!
[01:32.380 --> 01:32.820]  No!
[01:33.280 --> 01:34.420]  No, I'm behind!
[01:35.540 --> 01:36.560]  Shaw shit redemption.
[01:36.920 --> 01:37.080]  Yeah.
[01:37.260 --> 01:37.600]  Fuck!
[01:39.760 --> 01:42.340]  All right, Geoff is set up perfectly for the whale's mouth.
[01:43.300 --> 01:44.300]  Fuck the whale's mouth.
[01:44.680 --> 01:45.840]  And avoided it fully.
[01:46.660 --> 01:46.900]  Oh no.
[01:47.240 --> 01:47.420]  Oh no.
[01:48.080 --> 01:49.360]  Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[01:49.360 --> 01:49.660]  Go down.
[01:49.900 --> 01:51.040]  Do it, do it, do it, do it.
[01:51.420 --> 01:51.480]  Fuck!
[01:53.060 --> 01:53.500]  Oops!
[01:53.920 --> 01:54.960]  All right, well...
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.260]  And so this is my fault.
[01:56.260 --> 01:58.580]  So this is hole one.
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.820]  It's a part two.
[02:01.900 --> 02:02.340]  What?
[02:02.960 --> 02:03.940]  What was that?
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.460]  What did it hit?
[02:06.860 --> 02:07.520]  I just...
[02:07.520 --> 02:08.840]  It hit Geoff's ball.
[02:08.980 --> 02:09.940]  He called it back.
[02:10.120 --> 02:10.980]  It's just invisible.
[02:11.620 --> 02:13.520]  I can't see my ball.
[02:13.660 --> 02:14.200]  It's invisible.
[02:14.540 --> 02:16.940]  It's an invisible freaking ball.
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.860]  And now I've moved it for everyone else.
[02:18.920 --> 02:19.700]  Son of a bitch.
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.200]  I don't know where is this ball.
[02:21.360 --> 02:22.520]  I don't want to hit his ball.
[02:23.940 --> 02:24.860]  Freaking game.
[02:25.120 --> 02:26.240]  Where is it?
[02:26.260 --> 02:28.160]  This is hole one.
[02:28.460 --> 02:29.920]  What a great idea.
[02:30.180 --> 02:32.040]  Invisible ball golf.
[02:33.320 --> 02:34.500]  Oh, what a hell.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.960]  Oh, I'm going into this whale.
[02:38.740 --> 02:39.900]  Why hit him?
[02:40.020 --> 02:41.120]  I think you hit Geoff's ball.
[02:41.340 --> 02:42.700]  I hit invisible Geoff.
[02:42.760 --> 02:43.920]  I think you hit Geoff again.
[02:44.020 --> 02:44.760]  No way.
[02:45.020 --> 02:46.200]  How did you do that?
[02:47.100 --> 02:48.620]  There's just no way.
[02:48.760 --> 02:49.720]  It's going to cut to Geoff.
[02:49.800 --> 02:51.300]  He's going to be right next to the hole.
[02:52.620 --> 02:52.800]  Oh.
[02:53.820 --> 02:54.340]  Oh!
[02:54.860 --> 02:57.000]  Oh, it went through his lips.
[02:57.160 --> 02:57.860]  You got robbed.
[02:58.020 --> 02:58.800]  You got robbed, bud.
[02:59.060 --> 03:00.140]  Go a tooth over there.
[03:00.700 --> 03:01.520]  The whales have lips?
[03:02.600 --> 03:03.380]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:05.700 --> 03:07.000]  I don't think so.
[03:07.140 --> 03:07.680]  I don't know.
[03:09.340 --> 03:10.260]  Oh, that was close.
[03:10.660 --> 03:11.400]  Oh, nice.
[03:12.000 --> 03:12.400]  Nice.
[03:12.720 --> 03:13.380]  Safe move.
[03:13.960 --> 03:15.960]  I don't know what exactly to do here.
[03:16.580 --> 03:17.080]  Hit it hard.
[03:17.340 --> 03:18.360]  Just got a beans in it.
[03:18.500 --> 03:18.920]  Yeah, beans.
[03:19.180 --> 03:20.060]  Well, beans is not good.
[03:20.060 --> 03:20.800]  You need some beans.
[03:22.840 --> 03:23.160]  Beans?
[03:23.160 --> 03:24.060]  You're on a lot of blue.
[03:24.700 --> 03:25.760]  Oh, that's a lot of beans.
[03:25.800 --> 03:26.840]  Maybe a little less on the beans.
[03:26.880 --> 03:27.640]  All right, all right, all right.
[03:27.680 --> 03:28.260]  Too many beans.
[03:28.720 --> 03:29.240]  Too many beans.
[03:29.340 --> 03:29.660]  Too many beans.
[03:29.940 --> 03:31.220]  Oh, you got it.
[03:31.220 --> 03:31.880]  Oh, you got it.
[03:31.940 --> 03:32.080]  Filling it.
[03:32.740 --> 03:33.160]  There you go.
[03:33.560 --> 03:34.020]  Full beans.
[03:35.880 --> 03:36.480]  Eat it, buddy.
[03:36.500 --> 03:36.560]  What?
[03:36.960 --> 03:37.480]  There you go.
[03:37.720 --> 03:38.520]  A hole in one.
[03:39.280 --> 03:39.860]  Into the water.
[03:40.200 --> 03:40.420]  Way to go.
[03:40.420 --> 03:40.860]  Get in there.
[03:41.280 --> 03:41.980]  Way to go, man.
[03:42.000 --> 03:42.820]  Yeah, bogey.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.660]  Son of a bitch.
[03:46.720 --> 03:47.860]  All right, I'm going to do that.
[03:47.980 --> 03:49.980]  Geoff's got the opportunity to do the same thing.
[03:50.000 --> 03:50.500]  He's got it.
[03:51.200 --> 03:51.900]  Right here.
[03:52.020 --> 03:52.860]  Here it goes.
[03:53.060 --> 03:53.620]  Here it comes.
[03:53.760 --> 03:54.580]  And here it goes.
[03:54.740 --> 03:55.400]  And here goes Geoff.
[04:06.600 --> 04:08.360]  Oh, Christ almighty.
[04:08.960 --> 04:09.760]  Right through.
[04:09.960 --> 04:11.540]  I can't even be mad at that.
[04:11.660 --> 04:12.760]  That was just dumb.
[04:13.120 --> 04:13.560]  Okay.
[04:13.780 --> 04:14.180]  You're good.
[04:14.300 --> 04:14.560]  You're good.
[04:15.480 --> 04:17.140]  Holy shit, I suck.
[04:20.520 --> 04:21.300]  There we go.
[04:21.340 --> 04:22.120]  There we go.
[04:22.120 --> 04:22.740]  Nicely done.
[04:23.400 --> 04:25.060]  Oh, you're going to roll back down.
[04:25.180 --> 04:25.380]  Nope.
[04:25.700 --> 04:25.920]  Nope.
[04:26.040 --> 04:26.300]  Nope.
[04:26.300 --> 04:26.420]  Nope.
[04:26.500 --> 04:27.700]  We're going to stop right there.
[04:27.960 --> 04:29.860]  And then we're going to stop and it's going to stop right.
[04:30.080 --> 04:30.220]  Yep.
[04:30.420 --> 04:30.760]  Oh, wow.
[04:30.800 --> 04:31.820]  You got lucky there, bud.
[04:32.620 --> 04:33.240]  Very good.
[04:33.700 --> 04:33.900]  All right.
[04:34.000 --> 04:34.340]  All right.
[04:34.340 --> 04:35.300]  You got this right here, Geoff.
[04:35.540 --> 04:36.100]  Right in the hole.
[04:36.520 --> 04:38.060]  Right in the whale's mouth.
[04:39.120 --> 04:40.280]  I think you did the exact same thing.
[04:40.560 --> 04:40.900]  Oh, no.
[04:42.880 --> 04:43.840]  I'll get you next time.
[04:44.640 --> 04:45.920]  You're having a whale of a time.
[04:46.320 --> 04:48.980]  I think Geoff's character doesn't know when to use finger guns.
[04:49.480 --> 04:49.840]  Yeah.
[04:50.080 --> 04:50.480]  Oh, no.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.000]  Okay.
[04:52.720 --> 04:53.620]  What about now?
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.900]  Is now an appropriate time?
[04:57.820 --> 04:58.860]  Eric, you know what you have to do?
[04:59.160 --> 04:59.980]  Oh, you're putting up beans.
[05:00.880 --> 05:02.360]  That's not enough beans.
[05:02.800 --> 05:04.060]  That's not enough beans at all.
[05:04.160 --> 05:04.980]  Look at that stupid fucking bird.
[05:04.980 --> 05:05.840]  Oh, that seagull is judging you.
[05:05.840 --> 05:09.140]  He is laughing his ass off at you.
[05:09.520 --> 05:10.260]  Oh, boy.
[05:10.300 --> 05:11.160]  You got it on this one.
[05:11.500 --> 05:11.840]  What are you doing?
[05:11.920 --> 05:12.580]  The whale's right there.
[05:13.500 --> 05:14.680]  This one's talking shit to you.
[05:16.280 --> 05:17.060]  There you go.
[05:17.080 --> 05:17.780]  Oh, you got it.
[05:17.900 --> 05:19.480]  Are you kidding me?
[05:19.480 --> 05:20.680]  You missed.
[05:20.980 --> 05:21.700]  Oh, no.
[05:21.960 --> 05:22.760]  How did that miss?
[05:23.460 --> 05:24.080]  Oh, no.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.060]  It did go through the whale.
[05:25.300 --> 05:26.300]  I'll give you that one.
[05:26.520 --> 05:27.360]  That was kind of bullshit.
[05:28.760 --> 05:29.740]  Kind of bullshit?
[05:31.160 --> 05:31.640]  Fuh.
[05:31.980 --> 05:32.920]  Kind of whale shit.
[05:33.600 --> 05:35.800]  It was almost all bullshit.
[05:38.800 --> 05:39.800]  That dumb bird.
[05:40.180 --> 05:41.700]  It makes me so happy.
[05:42.860 --> 05:44.440]  Oh, you want to fight over it?
[05:44.620 --> 05:45.700]  Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[05:45.700 --> 05:46.180]  Oh, no.
[05:46.340 --> 05:47.440]  Stop. Stop. Stop.
[05:47.560 --> 05:48.280]  Oh, no.
[05:48.500 --> 05:49.460]  He's got momentum.
[05:49.460 --> 05:50.080]  Oh, no.
[05:50.240 --> 05:51.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:51.900 --> 05:52.720]  Now you got a straight shot.
[05:53.700 --> 05:54.720]  Oh, my God.
[05:54.860 --> 05:57.940]  These two seagulls are just dying laughing.
[05:57.940 --> 06:00.120]  I did that on purpose because I want to re-angle.
[06:00.820 --> 06:02.800]  They're just yellowed back and forth on each other.
[06:02.900 --> 06:04.680]  Yeah, this idiot's still here, too.
[06:04.980 --> 06:06.560]  They're still here as well.
[06:06.740 --> 06:07.600]  Just get up here.
[06:07.720 --> 06:08.460]  Just get up.
[06:08.600 --> 06:08.700]  Get close.
[06:08.700 --> 06:11.120]  What is max strokes on this 14?
[06:11.200 --> 06:12.560]  I'm going to go for 14 every hole.
[06:12.840 --> 06:13.580]  Yeah, you're almost there.
[06:15.500 --> 06:17.820]  You repositioned yourself and I just don't know that it's any better.
[06:18.440 --> 06:18.880]  Mmm.
[06:24.140 --> 06:25.360]  I'm like 10 cup.
[06:25.420 --> 06:25.900]  Come on.
[06:28.680 --> 06:29.860]  Geoff, get up there and squat him.
[06:30.160 --> 06:32.560]  Whose stupid fucking idea was this game?
[06:32.960 --> 06:34.560]  I think this was Nick's idea today.
[06:34.660 --> 06:34.860]  No.
[06:35.080 --> 06:36.440]  The guy who's not playing?
[06:36.700 --> 06:37.240]  It was Andrew.
[06:37.640 --> 06:38.540]  It was definitely Andrew.
[06:40.320 --> 06:41.240]  Well, you heard it here first.
[06:41.320 --> 06:41.940]  Gavin's idea.
[06:43.680 --> 06:44.440]  Plus seven.
[06:45.080 --> 06:46.080]  Look at that crab over there.
[06:46.960 --> 06:47.800]  He's rooting for me.
[06:48.300 --> 06:49.100]  All right.
[06:49.220 --> 06:49.540]  Watch this.
[06:49.660 --> 06:50.580]  He's coming closer to you.
[06:50.940 --> 06:51.580]  All right.
[06:51.660 --> 06:51.920]  Perfect.
[06:52.280 --> 06:53.380]  There you go.
[06:53.720 --> 06:54.320]  That's it right there.
[06:54.940 --> 06:56.340]  Hole in one right here, baby.
[07:01.950 --> 07:02.790]  Hole in one.
[07:03.030 --> 07:03.830]  You undershot it for a moment.
[07:04.170 --> 07:05.050]  No, no, no.
[07:05.170 --> 07:05.930]  It's all about...
[07:05.930 --> 07:07.150]  You got to have that subtle touch.
[07:08.050 --> 07:08.330]  Boom.
[07:08.430 --> 07:08.750]  Plus nine.
[07:08.810 --> 07:09.890]  You got two hole in ones.
[07:10.830 --> 07:11.710]  Way to go, buddy.
[07:12.010 --> 07:12.270]  Thanks.
[07:12.430 --> 07:12.590]  Thanks.
[07:13.490 --> 07:14.230]  Oh, it's a snake.
[07:14.370 --> 07:14.910]  I don't like that.
[07:15.210 --> 07:15.730]  Oh, no.
[07:17.610 --> 07:18.150]  Uh-oh.
[07:18.150 --> 07:19.450]  You got this.
[07:20.470 --> 07:21.950]  What's the hole in one?
[07:23.150 --> 07:23.830]  Top one.
[07:24.770 --> 07:25.750]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:25.770 --> 07:26.450]  You go first.
[07:26.790 --> 07:27.830]  Should have done so well.
[07:28.410 --> 07:29.390]  I'm going to give it this many points.
[07:29.390 --> 07:31.730]  I really like that the seagull has followed to the next hole.
[07:31.850 --> 07:33.290]  Be like, I got to get more of this.
[07:33.570 --> 07:34.390]  This is crazy.
[07:34.910 --> 07:35.010]  What happened?
[07:35.010 --> 07:36.050]  You actually did a vacuum hole.
[07:36.770 --> 07:37.470]  Oh, sweet.
[07:37.610 --> 07:38.450]  Vacuum sucked me up.
[07:38.770 --> 07:39.290]  Sucked me up.
[07:39.290 --> 07:39.450]  I didn't see.
[07:40.030 --> 07:41.370]  Did you see Gavin's...
[07:41.370 --> 07:41.550]  What?
[07:41.690 --> 07:41.870]  No.
[07:42.230 --> 07:43.950]  It just cut to Gavin having a hole in one.
[07:44.030 --> 07:44.610]  Didn't see anything.
[07:44.890 --> 07:46.250]  I didn't see any of it.
[07:46.250 --> 07:46.970]  Really?
[07:47.410 --> 07:49.870]  Definitely got to use Gavin's footage on that one.
[07:49.890 --> 07:50.590]  Yeah, use my backup.
[07:52.550 --> 07:53.410]  Alright, see this one.
[07:53.910 --> 07:54.150]  Yeah.
[07:54.310 --> 07:55.410]  It looks like this.
[07:56.450 --> 07:57.010]  Missed it.
[07:57.390 --> 07:58.570]  It's slightly different to this.
[07:58.870 --> 07:59.430]  Yeah, there we go.
[08:00.950 --> 08:02.250]  What does a spring do?
[08:02.730 --> 08:03.230]  Makes you jump.
[08:03.430 --> 08:03.810]  A boing.
[08:05.790 --> 08:06.950]  Asked and answered.
[08:07.530 --> 08:09.270]  What does a spring do?
[08:12.230 --> 08:12.970]  There you go.
[08:13.490 --> 08:14.750]  How hard would you say you hit that?
[08:16.210 --> 08:16.570]  Mid.
[08:17.450 --> 08:18.270]  Oh, he's missed it.
[08:18.290 --> 08:20.070]  Oh, don't do that.
[08:20.350 --> 08:20.810]  Oh, no.
[08:21.010 --> 08:21.630]  Is that the beginning?
[08:21.890 --> 08:22.470]  Are you back to the start?
[08:22.690 --> 08:23.030]  No, no.
[08:23.030 --> 08:24.490]  He's just going the long way.
[08:24.770 --> 08:25.490]  Oh, man.
[08:25.830 --> 08:27.110]  He's doing snake level the long way.
[08:28.730 --> 08:29.450]  Oh, wow.
[08:29.750 --> 08:30.910]  He's in a better position.
[08:31.610 --> 08:32.090]  I agree.
[08:32.150 --> 08:33.410]  I think he's in a better position than me.
[08:34.470 --> 08:35.630]  Watch out for Sebastian down there.
[08:35.670 --> 08:37.590]  I think you need more beans than you think you need.
[08:37.650 --> 08:38.790]  Less than extra medium, Geoff.
[08:41.010 --> 08:41.490]  Get it.
[08:41.590 --> 08:42.070]  Get there.
[08:42.170 --> 08:42.510]  Get there.
[08:42.590 --> 08:43.030]  Pretty good.
[08:43.030 --> 08:43.350]  Oh.
[08:43.930 --> 08:44.470]  Oh.
[08:45.150 --> 08:45.690]  Oh.
[08:47.290 --> 08:47.830]  Oh.
[08:48.410 --> 08:48.950]  Oh.
[08:49.990 --> 08:50.530]  Oh.
[08:50.770 --> 08:51.110]  Oh, oh, oh.
[08:51.110 --> 08:51.890]  Don't bump into me.
[08:52.070 --> 08:53.190]  Oh, oh, oh.
[08:53.550 --> 08:54.170]  Oh, no.
[08:54.450 --> 08:54.890]  Oh, no.
[08:55.130 --> 08:55.610]  Oh, no.
[08:55.670 --> 08:56.290]  Oh, no.
[08:57.390 --> 08:59.450]  Oh, oh, oh.
[08:59.910 --> 09:01.290]  Oh, hey, hey.
[09:01.490 --> 09:01.550]  Oh.
[09:01.810 --> 09:02.490]  No good.
[09:03.550 --> 09:03.930]  Oh.
[09:05.150 --> 09:06.710]  Get a bank off the crab.
[09:07.750 --> 09:08.070]  Boom.
[09:08.530 --> 09:08.810]  Bang.
[09:09.110 --> 09:10.030]  Oh, nice.
[09:10.470 --> 09:10.910]  Thank you.
[09:11.190 --> 09:11.850]  Crab boom bom.
[09:12.530 --> 09:14.210]  There we go. Easy, easy, easy.
[09:15.670 --> 09:17.690]  All right, attack the crab. Crab attack, go.
[09:18.670 --> 09:19.030]  I'm waiting.
[09:19.330 --> 09:19.950]  Hit that motherfucker.
[09:20.090 --> 09:20.810]  I don't want to hurt any crabs.
[09:22.630 --> 09:23.670]  He wants to hurt you.
[09:25.070 --> 09:25.930]  Oh, what a shot!
[09:26.410 --> 09:26.810]  Wow.
[09:28.730 --> 09:29.870]  That's pretty impressive, man.
[09:31.250 --> 09:33.730]  The rebound angles make no sense in this game.
[09:34.190 --> 09:35.570]  None. None. Physics are crazy.
[09:35.910 --> 09:36.990]  I got a great angle here.
[09:37.490 --> 09:38.750]  You got it. Easy.
[09:39.230 --> 09:39.690]  Oh, that's so good.
[09:39.690 --> 09:40.950]  Oh yeah, scoop that wall.
[09:41.290 --> 09:41.770]  There it is.
[09:41.850 --> 09:42.450]  Nice.
[09:43.910 --> 09:44.270]  Okay.
[09:47.350 --> 09:48.130]  What does that do?
[09:48.250 --> 09:49.010]  You're close to the spring.
[09:49.370 --> 09:49.970]  All right.
[09:53.050 --> 09:55.470]  I wasn't sure if it made everybody else jump or you jump.
[09:58.110 --> 09:58.470]  Little...
[09:59.390 --> 09:59.750]  Rough.
[10:00.710 --> 10:02.230]  This game is touchy about beans.
[10:02.810 --> 10:06.390]  If I picked up a spring and it made everyone else jump in a video game, I'd shit my pants.
[10:08.990 --> 10:09.510]  Way to go, Andrew.
[10:09.770 --> 10:10.310]  Nice par.
[10:10.330 --> 10:10.530]  Thank you.
[10:12.490 --> 10:12.890]  Hmm.
[10:14.110 --> 10:14.370]  Yeah.
[10:14.590 --> 10:15.890]  Oh, what a shit angle.
[10:16.290 --> 10:17.630]  Maybe it's gonna make everyone else jump.
[10:18.690 --> 10:20.810]  You will it make everyone else jump? That's a good question.
[10:21.090 --> 10:21.510]  It might.
[10:22.810 --> 10:23.050]  Uh, let's go ahead and...
[10:23.050 --> 10:25.510]  Why fire don't make you go fast? Why fire a hazard?
[10:27.150 --> 10:27.550]  Great.
[10:27.850 --> 10:28.190]  Geoff.
[10:28.230 --> 10:29.810]  Great. Great. Great.
[10:29.810 --> 10:30.490]  Jump up!
[10:30.590 --> 10:31.250]  Geoff, try jumping.
[10:31.290 --> 10:33.470]  Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.
[10:33.570 --> 10:34.290]  Now I'm at the right...
[10:34.690 --> 10:36.050]  How in the world?
[10:36.310 --> 10:37.950]  Great. I'm happy.
[10:39.210 --> 10:39.930]  Happy with that.
[10:40.230 --> 10:40.610]  How?
[10:41.050 --> 10:41.450]  Again!
[10:42.370 --> 10:45.330]  How again? I'm two for two with that shit.
[10:45.810 --> 10:47.650]  You can jump it, Geoff. You can jump it.
[10:47.870 --> 10:48.630]  I know.
[10:50.570 --> 10:52.290]  Or, or it'll make me jump.
[10:52.330 --> 10:53.450]  Or you'll make Geoff again.
[10:53.450 --> 10:54.430]  Whatever his name is.
[10:54.850 --> 10:55.010]  Jump.
[10:56.730 --> 10:57.970]  Whatever his name is.
[11:00.190 --> 11:01.610]  There you go. You got this, Eric, probably.
[11:03.590 --> 11:03.990]  Great.
[11:04.030 --> 11:04.430]  Yeah!
[11:10.020 --> 11:10.420]  And...
[11:10.420 --> 11:11.100]  There we go.
[11:11.560 --> 11:12.040]  Thank you.
[11:13.880 --> 11:14.320]  Whoa!
[11:16.060 --> 11:17.200]  No finger guns today.
[11:22.180 --> 11:23.360]  What do we got next?
[11:23.380 --> 11:25.940]  That looks like a big dick. That looks like a huge dick.
[11:26.100 --> 11:28.520]  That is a giant dick. It's a huge dick.
[11:28.740 --> 11:29.720]  Oh, that's such a big dick.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.040]  Fucking crazy.
[11:31.320 --> 11:31.740]  I wonder...
[11:32.740 --> 11:36.460]  If anyone has ever played golf the way we played Mario Party March,
[11:36.600 --> 11:38.880]  where you just do 18 holes, one a day.
[11:39.260 --> 11:39.780]  One a day.
[11:39.840 --> 11:41.660]  Would you have to pay to get in 18 times?
[11:41.760 --> 11:42.480]  I bet you would.
[11:45.160 --> 11:46.460]  Alright, I'm gonna give it a...
[11:46.460 --> 11:48.480]  Yeah, we should try that with real life stuff.
[11:48.600 --> 11:48.960]  Whoa!
[11:49.380 --> 11:49.820]  I agree.
[11:50.960 --> 11:51.980]  Springo bango, baby!
[11:53.600 --> 11:55.600]  I had that spring locked and loaded.
[11:55.740 --> 11:58.120]  Oh no, but look at that hill I have to go up.
[11:58.340 --> 12:00.060]  Oh man, that's a big hill.
[12:00.640 --> 12:01.380]  That's rough.
[12:01.580 --> 12:02.640]  I'm down in the sack.
[12:03.360 --> 12:04.540]  You gotta stay at the throat, dude.
[12:04.580 --> 12:05.320]  You gotta stay at the top.
[12:06.360 --> 12:06.540]  Whoa.
[12:07.360 --> 12:07.760]  No!
[12:08.260 --> 12:08.960]  Oh my god, no.
[12:09.960 --> 12:10.800]  Sorry, John Cena.
[12:11.420 --> 12:11.820]  Fuck.
[12:13.020 --> 12:14.240]  Where's the hole in one shot?
[12:14.240 --> 12:15.280]  I can't even see where...
[12:15.280 --> 12:15.540]  I don't know.
[12:16.800 --> 12:17.940]  Maybe all the way to the right.
[12:18.080 --> 12:18.760]  It's gotta like hug a wall.
[12:24.270 --> 12:24.810]  Let's see.
[12:25.690 --> 12:26.510]  Well, it's not that.
[12:26.750 --> 12:28.170]  No, it's not the right apparently.
[12:29.230 --> 12:30.250]  Keep rolling, keep rolling.
[12:30.290 --> 12:31.410]  Awesome, great.
[12:32.690 --> 12:33.050]  Cool.
[12:33.770 --> 12:34.370]  You're not in the water.
[12:34.450 --> 12:35.490]  Maybe try the left, Gavin.
[12:36.050 --> 12:37.090]  No, it's okay with some left.
[12:37.530 --> 12:38.670]  I'll just aim right at the hole.
[12:39.130 --> 12:39.330]  Yeah.
[12:40.270 --> 12:40.990]  And beans.
[12:42.530 --> 12:42.890]  Oh!
[12:43.810 --> 12:44.170]  What?
[12:46.150 --> 12:47.170]  That was pretty cool.
[12:47.430 --> 12:48.630]  That was pretty cool.
[12:48.770 --> 12:49.170]  What?
[12:49.570 --> 12:50.090]  That's my favorite.
[12:50.610 --> 12:51.410]  What's that power-up?
[12:51.610 --> 12:52.310]  I think it's a shield.
[12:52.530 --> 12:53.910]  That's the purple power-up.
[12:54.230 --> 12:55.010]  Thanks, man.
[12:55.350 --> 12:55.450]  Yeah.
[12:56.050 --> 12:57.170]  Crap sounds wet.
[12:57.470 --> 12:58.610]  It's like that key in Doom.
[12:58.790 --> 12:59.850]  Oh, there we go.
[12:59.990 --> 13:01.090]  There we go, there we go, there we go.
[13:01.130 --> 13:02.210]  We're okay, we're in business.
[13:02.550 --> 13:02.810]  Stop.
[13:05.350 --> 13:06.150]  Oh, man.
[13:07.050 --> 13:07.250]  No!
[13:07.830 --> 13:08.550]  Other crab!
[13:09.790 --> 13:11.990]  I'm doing a little, just a little tap on the left.
[13:12.410 --> 13:13.250]  Looking for a new shell.
[13:13.730 --> 13:15.750]  See if it can just use some momentum and...
[13:15.750 --> 13:16.450]  Oh, there you go.
[13:16.450 --> 13:17.570]  Cook it's way down here.
[13:17.610 --> 13:18.590]  There you go.
[13:21.370 --> 13:21.770]  Oh.
[13:23.150 --> 13:23.950]  You cheetah.
[13:24.950 --> 13:26.610]  Oh, there you go, Eric.
[13:26.690 --> 13:27.310]  Oh, fuck.
[13:27.370 --> 13:28.010]  Oh, my God.
[13:28.190 --> 13:30.210]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[13:31.470 --> 13:32.270]  Oh, fuck.
[13:35.490 --> 13:36.190]  Bastard man.
[13:36.650 --> 13:37.530]  I was trying to help.
[13:38.010 --> 13:39.290]  Andrew the bastard man.
[13:39.310 --> 13:40.330]  I was trying to help.
[13:40.710 --> 13:42.310]  Well, he might be more lined up with the hole now.
[13:43.790 --> 13:45.130]  Oh, maybe it's that shiny lock.
[13:47.310 --> 13:48.830]  Get the golden log.
[13:49.250 --> 13:51.010]  It's long, it's long.
[13:52.230 --> 13:52.710]  Yep.
[13:54.370 --> 13:54.850]  Wow.
[13:55.370 --> 13:55.850]  Wow.
[13:56.230 --> 13:57.310]  Oh, sneaky.
[13:57.910 --> 13:58.630]  Yeah, that's it.
[13:58.730 --> 13:59.550]  Thanks for pointing it out, guys.
[14:00.390 --> 14:01.670]  Hey, no worries.
[14:01.890 --> 14:03.010]  Now I just have to do it, right?
[14:03.330 --> 14:03.730]  Easy.
[14:05.330 --> 14:05.810]  Easy.
[14:07.630 --> 14:08.590]  And easy.
[14:09.170 --> 14:09.990]  Oh, you nailed it.
[14:10.170 --> 14:10.770]  That's going to work.
[14:11.390 --> 14:11.590]  Nope.
[14:12.150 --> 14:12.630]  Nope.
[14:13.030 --> 14:13.510]  Nope.
[14:13.990 --> 14:15.410]  Get in there.
[14:15.410 --> 14:16.530]  Is he going to make it?
[14:16.970 --> 14:17.190]  Yeah.
[14:18.390 --> 14:18.950]  He missed.
[14:22.850 --> 14:24.950]  Oh, a freaking rim tease.
[14:25.490 --> 14:27.250]  Oh, no, you don't want to be down here, too.
[14:27.790 --> 14:28.590]  This is not where you want to be.
[14:32.290 --> 14:34.250]  Boy, am I glued.
[14:36.850 --> 14:37.550]  That's rough.
[14:38.910 --> 14:40.170]  Oh, man, that sucks.
[14:40.550 --> 14:41.710]  That couldn't have gone any better.
[14:43.250 --> 14:43.830]  All the way up.
[14:44.030 --> 14:44.730]  There we go.
[14:44.730 --> 14:46.530]  You keep hitting it to the left of the hole.
[14:47.890 --> 14:50.130]  I'm just trying to, I mean, it wasn't going to go in.
[14:50.510 --> 14:51.430]  I mean, it could have.
[14:51.550 --> 14:52.570]  I'm just trying to get up.
[14:52.670 --> 14:55.110]  I was concerned about going up the hill and that's it.
[14:55.670 --> 14:56.670]  You know what you have to do.
[14:59.570 --> 15:01.550]  I feel murderous rage.
[15:04.650 --> 15:05.630]  I'm going to go this way.
[15:06.670 --> 15:07.250]  Nailed it.
[15:07.310 --> 15:09.410]  No, no, you're an insane person.
[15:09.430 --> 15:10.190]  Way too many beans.
[15:10.510 --> 15:11.470]  Way too hard.
[15:11.850 --> 15:12.770]  That was insane.
[15:13.810 --> 15:14.330]  Get in.
[15:14.710 --> 15:16.870]  Oh, you're so lucky.
[15:20.740 --> 15:21.960]  How do you use the...
[15:21.960 --> 15:22.680]  How do you use the goo?
[15:22.880 --> 15:23.660]  B is your power up.
[15:23.680 --> 15:24.180]  B is goo.
[15:24.300 --> 15:24.940]  Yeah, you hit B.
[15:27.840 --> 15:30.780]  I don't know why I remember that, but I can't remember a single fucking button on Worms.
[15:30.800 --> 15:31.620]  What a shot.
[15:32.060 --> 15:32.640]  Wow, you...
[15:33.740 --> 15:35.060]  Dude, you gacked everywhere.
[15:36.480 --> 15:37.860]  You definitely screwed Eric over.
[15:38.820 --> 15:40.000]  Well, he's not going to overshoot it now.
[15:40.740 --> 15:41.440]  That's true.
[15:44.380 --> 15:45.280]  I guess he wasn't anyway.
[15:46.980 --> 15:48.460]  I'm scared of going back down that hill.
[15:49.060 --> 15:50.580]  I don't want to be there again.
[15:50.640 --> 15:52.060]  Send it back, Andrew.
[15:54.340 --> 15:55.380]  Oh, what a shot.
[15:55.480 --> 15:57.380]  Oh, what a shot.
[15:57.900 --> 15:59.920]  That was bullshit.
[16:00.340 --> 16:01.300]  That was incredible.
[16:01.460 --> 16:02.340]  That was so lucky.
[16:02.920 --> 16:03.680]  Pro move, dude.
[16:04.280 --> 16:05.320]  Why is it facing me backwards?
[16:05.520 --> 16:06.740]  I don't know, that's crazy.
[16:06.960 --> 16:08.560]  If you hit him hard enough, you'll bounce in.
[16:08.980 --> 16:09.940]  Yeah, I'll bank off.
[16:10.540 --> 16:11.340]  Uh-huh.
[16:11.540 --> 16:12.560]  Oh, he fucking did it.
[16:15.100 --> 16:17.120]  Just stop dead in your tracks.
[16:18.040 --> 16:18.800]  Uh-oh.
[16:23.020 --> 16:24.140]  Why'd you do that?
[16:26.160 --> 16:27.100]  Now the crap.
[16:32.140 --> 16:33.940]  Did you ask him why he did that?
[16:34.060 --> 16:35.200]  Yes, that's exactly what he did.
[16:35.960 --> 16:38.820]  Oh, what is that disco ball thing you've got?
[16:38.840 --> 16:39.580]  Is that electric ball?
[16:40.360 --> 16:41.380]  Oh, the lecky ball.
[16:41.380 --> 16:43.380]  I thought that looked different, but I don't know.
[16:46.460 --> 16:47.880]  All right, enough beans, Eric.
[16:48.580 --> 16:48.940]  Okay.
[16:49.860 --> 16:50.880]  Get me out of here.
[16:55.240 --> 16:56.140]  That's not a good angle.
[16:56.540 --> 16:57.880]  This has been a wall every time.
[16:57.980 --> 16:59.680]  Just think, you could have just been done with this.
[17:00.160 --> 17:00.880]  That's true.
[17:01.280 --> 17:02.780]  You could have just been done with this hole.
[17:03.180 --> 17:03.360]  Yeah.
[17:03.500 --> 17:04.760]  You were right next to the hole.
[17:04.940 --> 17:05.860]  You were locked in.
[17:05.980 --> 17:06.760]  You had it.
[17:07.100 --> 17:07.980]  There was no need.
[17:09.020 --> 17:09.380]  Yeah.
[17:12.960 --> 17:13.580]  No Andrew.
[17:15.100 --> 17:16.020]  Good activation, man.
[17:16.940 --> 17:18.120]  It doesn't carry over, does it?
[17:18.540 --> 17:18.760]  No.
[17:19.000 --> 17:19.160]  No.
[17:19.460 --> 17:20.380]  I mean, I don't think so.
[17:20.700 --> 17:21.640]  The power would have.
[17:21.720 --> 17:23.000]  You would have had the power in the next hole.
[17:23.600 --> 17:24.200]  Does it carry over?
[17:24.200 --> 17:24.780]  I thought it didn't.
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.040]  Yeah, I didn't think it did.
[17:26.520 --> 17:29.240]  Wait, everyone said no, and then you said no, but then you said it would carry over?
[17:29.840 --> 17:31.920]  You just used it so it wouldn't carry over.
[17:32.020 --> 17:32.540]  You got to hit the seal.
[17:32.540 --> 17:34.660]  If you did not use it, it would have carried over.
[17:35.060 --> 17:36.020]  Oh, that's what I was asking.
[17:37.480 --> 17:39.600]  All right, so are we recording the discord or not?
[17:40.260 --> 17:41.200]  No, no, just the game.
[17:41.660 --> 17:42.020]  Got it.
[17:45.280 --> 17:46.560]  Oh, not even close.
[17:46.760 --> 17:48.080]  Oh, but you're over at least.
[17:51.900 --> 17:52.260]  Fuck.
[17:54.800 --> 17:56.120]  Going right for that fucking clam.
[17:57.980 --> 17:59.100]  Boat's pretty well balanced.
[18:03.830 --> 18:04.150]  Nope.
[18:05.210 --> 18:07.790]  I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys know now it needs a lot of beans.
[18:08.970 --> 18:09.230]  Crap.
[18:09.230 --> 18:10.150]  Maybe the crap will help you.
[18:10.550 --> 18:11.610]  He doesn't even want me.
[18:11.950 --> 18:13.170]  Oh, it's just staring you down.
[18:13.390 --> 18:14.130]  Oh, he circled you.
[18:14.630 --> 18:15.430]  He's intimidated.
[18:15.910 --> 18:18.050]  I think if you hit the seagull, he'll probably carry it over.
[18:19.090 --> 18:19.550]  Do it.
[18:20.050 --> 18:21.890]  Might be full beans to do it, honestly.
[18:23.470 --> 18:24.230]  I put up!
[18:24.930 --> 18:26.290]  But it wasn't open.
[18:26.590 --> 18:28.390]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[18:28.850 --> 18:29.090]  Oh, shit.
[18:29.650 --> 18:30.670]  Oh, my God.
[18:30.910 --> 18:31.690]  Oh, he did it.
[18:32.010 --> 18:32.630]  Oh, he did it.
[18:33.250 --> 18:33.710]  He did it.
[18:34.350 --> 18:34.510]  Wow.
[18:37.150 --> 18:37.870]  Holy shit.
[18:38.010 --> 18:39.490]  I thought I must mess that right up.
[18:39.750 --> 18:40.590]  I thought you did too.
[18:40.770 --> 18:41.810]  That's crazy.
[18:42.050 --> 18:42.510]  Do over.
[18:42.750 --> 18:43.530]  I want to try again.
[18:43.530 --> 18:44.710]  See how Eric does.
[18:46.830 --> 18:47.730]  He's done it.
[18:49.710 --> 18:50.790]  Thought I had it.
[18:52.030 --> 18:53.710]  Oh, well, at least I get another shot.
[18:53.830 --> 18:55.230]  I get another shot at it, so it's fine.
[18:56.130 --> 18:56.970]  He's done it.
[18:57.130 --> 18:57.450]  Virtual cool.
[19:01.170 --> 19:01.890]  Oh, wow.
[19:02.050 --> 19:02.870]  Oh, wow.
[19:03.030 --> 19:04.330]  All right, back to where you were.
[19:05.150 --> 19:05.510]  Cool.
[19:09.530 --> 19:11.170]  Oh, you can go off of the clam.
[19:11.170 --> 19:12.970]  Yeah, is it like?
[19:13.210 --> 19:13.550]  Oh, God.
[19:23.210 --> 19:26.130]  That was a fuck you clam if I ever saw one.
[19:30.050 --> 19:32.090]  I don't know what, what?
[19:32.790 --> 19:33.710]  That's so unfair.
[19:34.330 --> 19:35.590]  I don't, I don't understand.
[19:35.870 --> 19:36.950]  What did I do wrong?
[19:38.190 --> 19:39.830]  What did I do wrong about him?
[19:41.390 --> 19:43.270]  What did I do wrong about the clam?
[19:44.810 --> 19:45.690]  Hey, what hole is this?
[19:45.850 --> 19:46.390]  Is this four?
[19:48.730 --> 19:49.490]  You cunt.
[19:54.750 --> 19:55.430]  It's four.
[19:57.450 --> 19:58.530]  There you go.
[19:58.610 --> 19:59.250]  What a shot.
[20:00.970 --> 20:03.610]  His mouth was open.
[20:04.630 --> 20:05.630]  He swallowed you.
[20:06.250 --> 20:07.970]  I think it's, I think it has to be closed.
[20:08.470 --> 20:09.330]  Oh, it has to be the opposite.
[20:09.770 --> 20:12.310]  Oh, the thing Gavin tried to time.
[20:12.390 --> 20:13.910]  He fucked up and got it right.
[20:18.290 --> 20:18.850]  Crazy.
[20:22.170 --> 20:24.450]  This game is such intense misery.
[20:24.570 --> 20:25.450]  I forgot about it.
[20:25.470 --> 20:26.350]  Oh, God.
[20:26.590 --> 20:32.290]  Oh, my God.
[20:40.430 --> 20:42.570]  I, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it.
[20:42.630 --> 20:43.930]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do about him.
[20:44.390 --> 20:45.650]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[20:45.890 --> 20:47.490]  I've hit him three times.
[20:47.590 --> 20:49.550]  How many times is Andrew going to hit this jump?
[20:49.670 --> 20:50.150]  There we go.
[20:50.390 --> 20:50.930]  There we go.
[21:02.530 --> 21:04.730]  I hit that way harder than it went.
[21:04.830 --> 21:06.270]  That's some bullshit right there.
[21:06.270 --> 21:07.790]  I hit that in the yellow...
[21:09.050 --> 21:09.450]  ish.
[21:12.490 --> 21:15.350]  I've hit him four times.
[21:15.410 --> 21:16.590]  It does not like you.
[21:16.870 --> 21:18.050]  I've hit him four times.
[21:18.130 --> 21:19.410]  Speaking of hitting people, don't hit me.
[21:20.290 --> 21:20.570]  Pull it up.
[21:21.230 --> 21:22.370]  I'm not giving up.
[21:22.510 --> 21:23.290]  I'm going...
[21:33.410 --> 21:34.970]  Were you trying to go round?
[21:35.310 --> 21:36.530]  I was just trying to...
[21:36.530 --> 21:37.970]  Yeah, I wasn't trying to go over the jump.
[21:38.510 --> 21:39.110]  How was that?
[21:39.230 --> 21:39.330]  What?
[21:40.090 --> 21:40.410]  What?
[21:40.530 --> 21:41.470]  That's what happened to me.
[21:42.170 --> 21:43.170]  Yeah, but it was you.
[21:43.330 --> 21:44.150]  It's different when it's me.
[21:46.370 --> 21:47.250]  He's done it.
[21:48.090 --> 21:49.370]  Yeah, but you need to stop.
[21:54.290 --> 21:55.570]  I've hit him every time.
[21:55.690 --> 21:56.590]  Like, this is crazy.
[21:56.950 --> 21:57.990]  This is like so nuts.
[21:58.110 --> 21:58.590]  There you go.
[21:58.650 --> 21:58.790]  Nice.
[21:58.930 --> 22:00.170]  I'm like, I'm just floored.
[22:00.470 --> 22:01.590]  Don't hit that fucking thing.
[22:01.750 --> 22:02.150]  Oh, no.
[22:10.130 --> 22:16.290]  I hate this game so much.
[22:18.230 --> 22:22.850]  I want to play.
[22:26.130 --> 22:27.750]  What did the camera just do there?
[22:29.050 --> 22:31.650]  I don't understand what happened with that one.
[22:42.210 --> 22:43.710]  That might have helped, Geoff.
[22:43.750 --> 22:44.510]  Oh, never mind.
[22:51.830 --> 22:54.130]  It doesn't let it come in bounds.
[23:01.550 --> 23:02.210]  He's done it.
[23:03.410 --> 23:05.270]  He's too good at the shot.
[23:05.850 --> 23:08.090]  In any other game, he would be perfect.
[23:11.930 --> 23:12.370]  No!
[23:14.990 --> 23:15.790]  Get away!
[23:17.790 --> 23:18.310]  Oh, no!
[23:21.310 --> 23:22.790]  Under the bridge.
[23:26.250 --> 23:27.930]  Geoff, he just has to watch.
[23:28.330 --> 23:30.230]  Geoff, he just has to sit and watch.
[23:30.650 --> 23:31.790]  There's nothing he can do.
[23:31.790 --> 23:34.350]  I'm still in the fucking air!
[23:38.290 --> 23:39.570]  Oh, god!
[23:43.410 --> 23:45.490]  Oh, it doesn't even do anything.
[23:46.290 --> 23:48.070]  It's so fucking funny.
[23:49.970 --> 23:50.810]  I've hit it.
[23:51.070 --> 23:52.990]  I've hit it every time.
[23:53.130 --> 23:56.110]  That's the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
[23:56.690 --> 23:58.210]  I've hit it every time.
[23:58.210 --> 24:02.350]  I've hit it every time.
[24:04.650 --> 24:05.130]  Why?
[24:06.830 --> 24:08.950]  Did I go too high in the air?
[24:09.710 --> 24:10.650]  Is there a ceiling?
[24:20.460 --> 24:22.120]  How does the out-of-bounds work?
[24:22.140 --> 24:22.960]  Is it like a timer?
[24:23.200 --> 24:24.560]  Like, you spend too long out-of-bounds?
[24:25.140 --> 24:26.480]  It doesn't make sense.
[24:26.480 --> 24:27.160]  I didn't see you.
[24:27.960 --> 24:29.720]  I didn't see you!
[24:30.020 --> 24:31.420]  What, you didn't see him?
[24:31.780 --> 24:34.740]  I was so focused on the wall!
[24:37.060 --> 24:38.380]  In-bounds!
[24:38.980 --> 24:47.320]  Oh, you had stopped my equation!
[24:48.040 --> 24:49.540]  That was such a fuck you, dude!
[24:49.800 --> 24:50.500]  Oh, shit!
[24:51.000 --> 24:51.920]  I hit it again!
[24:52.580 --> 24:54.640]  Fucking Charlie, that was...
[24:57.200 --> 24:59.800]  I can't stop doing this.
[25:00.880 --> 25:01.920]  Who means?
[25:04.280 --> 25:05.180]  Oh, shit!
[25:05.320 --> 25:06.220]  I held it too long.
[25:06.500 --> 25:06.580]  Fuck!
[25:09.040 --> 25:10.720]  What did I hit?
[25:11.780 --> 25:13.400]  Geoff's invisible again!
[25:14.260 --> 25:14.920]  He's invisible again.
[25:15.620 --> 25:16.460]  He was invisible.
[25:16.460 --> 25:17.720]  He knocked the shit out of me.
[25:18.860 --> 25:19.600]  Oh, god.
[25:19.640 --> 25:20.880]  Let's try one more time, huh?
[25:23.700 --> 25:25.000]  He did it again!
[25:25.080 --> 25:25.960]  He did it again!
[25:27.820 --> 25:29.280]  Pew, pew, pew!
[25:29.440 --> 25:30.020]  Finger gun!
[25:31.920 --> 25:33.680]  All right, you got this.
[25:35.740 --> 25:36.340]  Yeah!
[25:36.780 --> 25:37.180]  No!
[25:41.440 --> 25:42.640]  That's impossible.
[25:44.020 --> 25:46.160]  It's impossible to be this bad!
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.720]  In retrospect, Gavin timed it so poorly for what he was trying to do.
[25:55.880 --> 25:57.120]  And he got it!
[25:57.120 --> 25:57.740]  Oh, fuck!
[25:58.260 --> 25:58.640]  Oh, no!
[25:59.980 --> 26:00.600]  Oh, shit.
[26:01.100 --> 26:02.140]  Oh, shit.
[26:06.080 --> 26:07.360]  Yeah, there you go!
[26:07.400 --> 26:07.780]  Yes!
[26:08.000 --> 26:08.380]  Yes!
[26:08.740 --> 26:09.300]  Yes!
[26:09.300 --> 26:09.420]  Yes!
[26:09.420 --> 26:10.060]  He's done it!
[26:10.160 --> 26:10.700]  Finally!
[26:11.980 --> 26:12.560]  Just in time!
[26:13.740 --> 26:14.680]  Stroke 13!
[26:15.480 --> 26:17.580]  And he'll still score better than the other two.
[26:21.960 --> 26:22.860]  Stroke 13!
[26:23.620 --> 26:24.900]  All right, Andrew, you got it.
[26:24.900 --> 26:27.420]  I don't know what to do here!
[26:28.500 --> 26:30.500]  Look at him scramble!
[26:30.920 --> 26:31.840]  Yeah, it's just on the wall.
[26:31.860 --> 26:32.880]  Look at him scramble!
[26:33.580 --> 26:34.000]  Go!
[26:35.240 --> 26:35.700]  No!
[26:37.260 --> 26:38.400]  Not that way.
[26:39.380 --> 26:39.920]  All right.
[26:40.440 --> 26:43.520]  A little less.
[26:44.380 --> 26:45.000]  What?
[26:47.560 --> 26:49.360]  That should have been good.
[26:50.780 --> 26:51.780]  All right, boys.
[26:51.980 --> 26:52.180]  Sports.
[26:52.580 --> 26:53.320]  Stroke 14.
[26:53.960 --> 26:55.500]  What's the limit of strokes?
[26:56.040 --> 26:56.440]  14.
[26:56.880 --> 26:57.760]  It's 14.
[26:58.360 --> 26:58.940]  It's not!
[26:59.080 --> 27:00.240]  It just went to 15 for Andrew.
[27:01.200 --> 27:02.160]  Maybe it's infinite.
[27:03.140 --> 27:03.920]  Why do you keep...
[27:03.920 --> 27:04.180]  Whoa!
[27:05.440 --> 27:07.960]  Because I just slowly make your way forward.
[27:08.460 --> 27:09.800]  Oh, my god, it keeps going!
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.240]  Oh, my god, it keeps going!
[27:13.880 --> 27:14.160]  Oh.
[27:14.660 --> 27:15.420]  Oh, no!
[27:15.520 --> 27:16.060]  Oh, no!
[27:16.820 --> 27:17.600]  Oh, no!
[27:17.900 --> 27:21.560]  The giant clam opening up such a fair few at the end.
[27:25.720 --> 27:27.960]  Gavin has had to watch this for, like, 15 minutes.
[27:28.440 --> 27:29.460]  He's just watching.
[27:29.800 --> 27:30.480]  Oh, what a shot!
[27:31.220 --> 27:31.520]  No!
[27:34.420 --> 27:34.940]  I...
[27:34.940 --> 27:38.900]  I cannot believe that.
[27:39.360 --> 27:41.280]  Oh, my god!
[27:41.520 --> 27:42.060]  You're welcome.
[27:42.080 --> 27:42.700]  You helped him.
[27:43.060 --> 27:44.420]  Yeah, it's like a blue velvet.
[27:44.620 --> 27:45.080]  Thank you, Geoff!
[27:45.240 --> 27:45.800]  You're welcome.
[27:47.180 --> 27:48.040]  Oh, my god.
[27:48.140 --> 27:50.140]  Progress from most unexpected of places.
[27:50.400 --> 27:51.420]  I cannot fucking believe that.
[27:54.180 --> 27:54.780]  Into the crab.
[27:54.780 --> 27:55.520]  Right to the crab.
[27:56.000 --> 27:56.300]  No!
[27:57.060 --> 27:57.560]  Oh!
[27:57.580 --> 27:58.180]  Yeah, that's it!
[27:58.560 --> 27:58.860]  No!
[28:00.080 --> 28:01.420]  Almost with the crab assist.
[28:03.140 --> 28:04.900]  That was such an F you, dude.
[28:09.620 --> 28:10.560]  Geoff, why?
[28:11.220 --> 28:11.480]  Okay.
[28:11.480 --> 28:11.880]  Oh, no.
[28:12.620 --> 28:16.020]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[28:16.020 --> 28:16.040]  Oh.
[28:16.860 --> 28:17.720]  It's Devastator.
[28:19.140 --> 28:19.980]  I'm good.
[28:20.300 --> 28:22.700]  This game is insane.
[28:22.920 --> 28:23.120]  This is fine.
[28:23.120 --> 28:25.080]  I can load on the clam next time.
[28:25.080 --> 28:25.820]  Yeah, there you go.
[28:25.920 --> 28:26.880]  This game is crazy.
[28:27.640 --> 28:28.800]  This game is fucked.
[28:29.400 --> 28:30.740]  Oh, no.
[28:31.260 --> 28:31.340]  Oh.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.300]  Did he take my ball?
[28:33.520 --> 28:34.560]  Wait, where did the ball go?
[28:34.860 --> 28:35.700]  I think he's holding it.
[28:36.060 --> 28:37.440]  My screen dimmed for being idle.
[28:41.840 --> 28:42.280]  No!
[28:43.840 --> 28:44.280]  Oh.
[28:45.120 --> 28:47.740]  It was rolling back in bounds.
[28:48.900 --> 28:50.920]  I think you gotta shoot it over with the box.
[28:51.160 --> 28:51.280]  No?
[28:51.700 --> 28:52.340]  The box?
[28:52.440 --> 28:52.660]  Okay.
[28:52.660 --> 28:53.120]  I don't know.
[28:53.200 --> 28:53.680]  It's up to you.
[28:53.720 --> 28:54.260]  It's up to you.
[28:54.320 --> 28:54.800]  Try the box.
[28:54.840 --> 28:55.560]  I'm the clam.
[28:55.760 --> 28:57.600]  Get out of here, you fucking crab.
[28:58.440 --> 28:58.780]  Better hurry.
[29:00.220 --> 29:00.400]  Go.
[29:00.960 --> 29:01.820]  Not hard enough.
[29:01.880 --> 29:02.460]  None of beans.
[29:03.140 --> 29:04.180]  Was that full beans?
[29:04.800 --> 29:07.040]  It was 85% beans.
[29:07.860 --> 29:09.140]  Need 100 beans.
[29:10.220 --> 29:10.820]  Oh, my God.
[29:11.140 --> 29:12.660]  Oh, my God.
[29:13.300 --> 29:13.620]  Okay.
[29:14.300 --> 29:15.440]  Getting out of this hell.
[29:15.780 --> 29:16.040]  Stroke 19.
[29:16.080 --> 29:16.300]  This is it.
[29:16.440 --> 29:17.020]  Stroke 19.
[29:19.580 --> 29:20.140]  There it is.
[29:20.140 --> 29:20.460]  Go!
[29:20.600 --> 29:21.080]  There it is.
[29:21.100 --> 29:21.360]  Nailed it.
[29:21.380 --> 29:22.160]  He's done it!
[29:23.520 --> 29:24.140]  All right.
[29:24.700 --> 29:25.720]  I'm right behind you.
[29:27.180 --> 29:28.360]  You got this, Geoff.
[29:32.340 --> 29:34.300]  Wow, straight into the crab on my screen.
[29:34.680 --> 29:34.920]  Almost winning.
[29:35.940 --> 29:36.280]  Almost.
[29:36.960 --> 29:38.140]  Right to the crab.
[29:38.340 --> 29:39.660]  Yeah, that crab fucking got me.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.300]  Let's miss the ramp there.
[29:44.760 --> 29:46.220]  I think I can go to the left of the ramp.
[29:46.360 --> 29:46.620]  Just up there.
[29:47.340 --> 29:47.700]  Oh, okay.
[29:49.600 --> 29:51.280]  Do you get enough air from left of the ramp?
[29:51.340 --> 29:52.180]  You need to be a little bit closer.
[29:52.900 --> 29:53.260]  Yeah.
[29:53.540 --> 29:54.280]  There you go.
[29:54.460 --> 29:55.200]  That's the sound.
[29:55.380 --> 29:56.020]  That's perfect.
[29:56.700 --> 29:57.120]  Glue the crab.
[29:57.140 --> 29:57.580]  Yeah, fuck you, crab.
[29:59.100 --> 29:59.460]  Dude.
[30:01.280 --> 30:02.540]  How hard should I hit this?
[30:03.580 --> 30:03.940]  85%.
[30:05.400 --> 30:05.760]  Nope.
[30:05.860 --> 30:06.360]  Not hard enough.
[30:08.620 --> 30:10.120]  Apparently 85% wasn't it.
[30:10.860 --> 30:11.960]  Well, it opens up.
[30:12.040 --> 30:13.940]  So even if you go too far, I think you'll hit the backboard.
[30:15.160 --> 30:15.540]  Good call.
[30:15.800 --> 30:16.180]  That's in.
[30:17.320 --> 30:18.140]  We did it.
[30:18.460 --> 30:19.900]  I didn't even see the score.
[30:20.200 --> 30:21.200]  I didn't even get to see the score.
[30:21.200 --> 30:23.360]  No, I hit fast forward immediately.
[30:24.840 --> 30:26.060]  Look at this.
[30:27.820 --> 30:29.180]  Oh, I get to go first.
[30:29.180 --> 30:30.920]  What abomination will be waiting for you here?
[30:32.940 --> 30:33.680]  Oh, a spider.
[30:34.880 --> 30:36.020]  Do you want to go in the web?
[30:39.560 --> 30:40.520]  Oh, damn it.
[30:41.440 --> 30:45.080]  I thought I could hit the fire fast enough to burn it.
[30:45.540 --> 30:45.860]  Right.
[30:46.060 --> 30:46.880]  I think you can.
[30:47.160 --> 30:49.260]  I think that's why the fire's in front of it.
[30:49.340 --> 30:50.320]  That's probably the hole in one.
[30:52.420 --> 30:54.040]  What about the sparkling thing?
[30:55.080 --> 30:55.300]  What?
[30:55.860 --> 30:56.300]  What?
[30:57.020 --> 30:57.680]  What's happening?
[30:57.980 --> 30:59.620]  Yeah, I didn't understand any of that.
[31:01.640 --> 31:02.080]  Huh.
[31:02.980 --> 31:04.060]  Why did it do that?
[31:04.380 --> 31:04.740]  I don't know.
[31:05.980 --> 31:07.480]  Did that look weird on your screen?
[31:08.200 --> 31:10.700]  It just, it looks like it bounced short on something.
[31:10.800 --> 31:11.300]  It was just weird.
[31:13.760 --> 31:14.200]  Nice.
[31:18.600 --> 31:19.940]  Got a free shot.
[31:19.940 --> 31:21.660]  Now this fire is in front of it.
[31:21.820 --> 31:23.580]  Fuck you up, though.
[31:27.220 --> 31:27.580]  No!
[31:30.740 --> 31:32.340]  You got a free shot, though, for that.
[31:32.680 --> 31:33.140]  Free shot.
[31:35.360 --> 31:36.480]  Can you hit your own fire?
[31:37.180 --> 31:38.180]  Yeah, I believe so.
[31:38.640 --> 31:39.340]  Yeah, but it's not his.
[31:45.760 --> 31:46.480]  Oh, God.
[31:47.000 --> 31:47.740]  Oh, damn.
[31:47.800 --> 31:48.380]  This is a long one.
[31:48.820 --> 31:49.100]  Yeah.
[31:49.100 --> 31:50.780]  Where the fuck am I?
[31:52.560 --> 31:53.480]  You're in the next hole.
[31:55.340 --> 31:57.360]  All right, here comes Gavin.
[31:58.040 --> 31:59.720]  Where am I?
[32:00.720 --> 32:01.880]  You can go through there, huh?
[32:02.080 --> 32:03.440]  Yeah, mind the gap.
[32:05.160 --> 32:05.780]  Beans!
[32:07.820 --> 32:08.900]  You got a free shot.
[32:11.580 --> 32:12.500]  There you go.
[32:13.580 --> 32:13.980]  Okay.
[32:14.920 --> 32:17.420]  So now, I think...
[32:19.940 --> 32:20.740]  Full beans!
[32:21.660 --> 32:22.060]  Okay.
[32:23.880 --> 32:24.980]  Yeah, I don't know.
[32:25.560 --> 32:26.360]  That was full beans.
[32:28.040 --> 32:28.800]  Geoff did it.
[32:29.080 --> 32:29.580]  I did it.
[32:29.600 --> 32:29.920]  I did it.
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.040]  Geoff was at a different angle.
[32:31.200 --> 32:32.040]  Full beans, though.
[32:32.220 --> 32:32.720]  Yeah, for sure.
[32:33.180 --> 32:34.780]  Geoff was slightly closer at a different angle.
[32:35.060 --> 32:36.520]  Because there's a free shot ball up there.
[32:37.480 --> 32:37.900]  Oh, okay.
[32:39.460 --> 32:40.100]  Beans, dude!
[32:40.840 --> 32:41.140]  Fuck!
[32:41.720 --> 32:43.320]  The bat messed you up, dude.
[32:44.120 --> 32:45.320]  The bat hit it?
[32:45.840 --> 32:46.060]  Yeah.
[32:51.260 --> 32:52.120]  What the fuck?
[32:52.120 --> 32:53.280]  Are you fucking serious?
[32:54.120 --> 32:57.120]  Are you fucking serious right now?
[32:57.240 --> 32:58.460]  He jeffed it.
[32:58.640 --> 32:59.960]  He jeffed it.
[33:01.240 --> 33:02.520]  He jeffed it.
[33:03.320 --> 33:04.500]  He's a motherfucker.
[33:05.880 --> 33:07.160]  Why is it...
[33:07.700 --> 33:08.300]  What?
[33:09.020 --> 33:09.720]  I'm like...
[33:10.540 --> 33:11.900]  I'm like 100 meters away.
[33:12.640 --> 33:12.760]  What?
[33:13.600 --> 33:14.680]  Do you look fine on our screen?
[33:14.860 --> 33:15.040]  What?
[33:15.460 --> 33:17.480]  What's wrong with you?
[33:17.480 --> 33:18.680]  You look completely fine on my screen.
[33:18.680 --> 33:20.160]  Yeah, you look perfect.
[33:22.120 --> 33:22.600]  Right.
[33:23.440 --> 33:25.680]  You have to use the triggers.
[33:27.120 --> 33:28.000]  Okay, good.
[33:28.140 --> 33:28.900]  I don't know how that happened.
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.100]  He had held left trigger.
[33:30.160 --> 33:33.120]  If you hold left trigger right now, that's what he was looking at.
[33:34.420 --> 33:36.240]  That is... that's insane.
[33:37.500 --> 33:38.440]  Good catcher.
[33:39.120 --> 33:39.380]  Yeah.
[33:42.600 --> 33:43.080]  Okay.
[33:46.220 --> 33:47.520]  One more time, buddy.
[33:47.940 --> 33:48.300]  Damn.
[33:48.300 --> 33:49.640]  Wait, that wasn't even out of bounds?
[33:50.020 --> 33:50.780]  That's the sand trap.
[33:51.220 --> 33:54.680]  Enjoy your bunker.
[33:57.700 --> 33:59.020]  Yes! No! Yes!
[34:00.260 --> 34:01.480]  No! Yes!
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.480]  It's a real range of emotion.
[34:06.820 --> 34:07.400]  I got scared.
[34:08.620 --> 34:09.580]  He's going to the left.
[34:10.220 --> 34:10.520]  Yeah?
[34:11.680 --> 34:12.580]  Hitting a spider?
[34:13.020 --> 34:13.620]  Where are you?
[34:14.280 --> 34:15.680]  What was that?
[34:15.940 --> 34:16.800]  Definitely went to the left.
[34:18.420 --> 34:19.360]  All right.
[34:22.340 --> 34:24.500]  Definitely not doing the spiderweb.
[34:27.400 --> 34:29.500]  Are you fucking kidding me right now?
[34:30.980 --> 34:33.640]  You know what would have prevented you from bouncing all the way out?
[34:34.040 --> 34:34.600]  Spiderweb!
[34:34.680 --> 34:35.220]  Spiderweb.
[34:37.820 --> 34:38.380]  Spiderweb.
[34:38.920 --> 34:39.480]  Spiderweb.
[34:41.360 --> 34:43.580]  Stops Geoff going from the hole.
[34:44.080 --> 34:44.340]  Uh-oh.
[34:44.440 --> 34:44.600]  Oh!
[34:44.740 --> 34:45.120]  It's solid.
[34:48.580 --> 34:49.500]  It's fine.
[34:51.800 --> 34:52.940]  Spiderweb is fine.
[34:59.000 --> 34:59.460]  Spider!
[35:01.520 --> 35:01.980]  Web!
[35:04.080 --> 35:04.540]  Damn.
[35:05.540 --> 35:06.900]  I thought the fire lasted longer.
[35:07.660 --> 35:09.040]  Your own fire doesn't hurt you.
[35:09.600 --> 35:12.120]  Yeah, I thought the fire lasted longer.
[35:12.180 --> 35:12.900]  That's why I used it there.
[35:13.200 --> 35:14.700]  I wanted to use it on the spiderweb.
[35:15.660 --> 35:16.680]  Let's get on the hole.
[35:20.340 --> 35:21.040]  There we go.
[35:22.160 --> 35:23.040]  You're on track.
[35:23.720 --> 35:24.200]  Nice.
[35:25.500 --> 35:25.980]  Glue.
[35:32.020 --> 35:34.780]  If you hit the fire, maybe it'll jump you over the spiderweb.
[35:35.540 --> 35:35.880]  So yeah!
[35:36.900 --> 35:37.380]  Nope.
[35:38.460 --> 35:42.000]  I thought it might heat the ball up and then melt the spiderweb.
[35:47.460 --> 35:48.420]  Hit Geoff.
[35:49.160 --> 35:50.140]  You know what you have to do.
[35:51.640 --> 35:53.660]  You know what to do.
[35:53.880 --> 35:54.200]  Oh, nice.
[35:55.480 --> 35:57.240]  That was surprisingly okay.
[35:57.320 --> 35:59.000]  No, no, no, no, no, stop it!
[36:00.560 --> 36:01.660]  He nibbled me.
[36:03.380 --> 36:04.520]  All right, Geoff, I gotcha.
[36:07.080 --> 36:07.700]  Thank you.
[36:08.200 --> 36:08.960]  Yeah, no problem, man.
[36:10.140 --> 36:10.900]  He needs it.
[36:11.480 --> 36:12.020]  Fearless leader.
[36:13.900 --> 36:16.120]  I have no idea where I landed, but hopefully it's good.
[36:16.740 --> 36:17.940]  Fire up to the right, Andrew.
[36:17.940 --> 36:21.620]  You didn't reappear in front of Eric, so chances are it's good unless the game glitched.
[36:22.420 --> 36:23.780]  You just have to be careful of the spider.
[36:25.180 --> 36:26.660]  Yeah, there's spiders on this level.
[36:26.740 --> 36:26.980]  No!
[36:30.500 --> 36:30.820]  Shit.
[36:31.760 --> 36:32.580]  You can help Eric up.
[36:32.720 --> 36:33.700]  I'm in the spider hole.
[36:36.460 --> 36:37.240]  Oh, look at that.
[36:38.100 --> 36:39.180]  Oh, you got it, Geoff.
[36:40.120 --> 36:40.560]  He's shy.
[36:41.360 --> 36:42.420]  Oh my god.
[36:42.720 --> 36:43.300]  What are you, me?
[36:45.180 --> 36:47.840]  Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[36:47.840 --> 36:49.920]  Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[36:50.180 --> 36:52.260]  You want to do it, you want to do it, you want to do it.
[36:52.520 --> 36:53.540]  You want it, you can do it.
[36:54.480 --> 36:56.660]  Oh, that would have been in the hole if you would have aimed normal.
[36:56.940 --> 36:58.400]  Yeah, you might have put both of you in the hole.
[37:01.980 --> 37:02.260]  Selfish.
[37:03.980 --> 37:04.260]  Spider!
[37:08.790 --> 37:09.930]  Uh-oh, you might get a nibbling.
[37:11.430 --> 37:12.270]  A little dip.
[37:12.650 --> 37:16.570]  He's a pretty, uh, pretty not so bad spider.
[37:17.570 --> 37:18.090]  No, he's fine.
[37:18.110 --> 37:18.530]  He's nice.
[37:18.530 --> 37:20.030]  He's a nice little guy.
[37:21.070 --> 37:21.850]  There you go.
[37:22.190 --> 37:22.870]  There we go.
[37:25.990 --> 37:27.190]  Oh, stop it!
[37:27.650 --> 37:29.050]  Take me to my web.
[37:30.170 --> 37:32.110]  Alright, three quarters beans. Oh.
[37:37.150 --> 37:37.650]  Alright.
[37:38.090 --> 37:38.610]  You got this.
[37:38.650 --> 37:39.190]  You got it right here?
[37:39.470 --> 37:39.790]  Right here.
[37:40.030 --> 37:40.990]  Right here you got it.
[37:41.370 --> 37:42.370]  You got it?
[37:42.890 --> 37:43.330]  You got it?
[37:43.330 --> 37:43.910]  There you go.
[37:44.210 --> 37:44.710]  Wow!
[37:45.470 --> 37:46.310]  Nice shot.
[37:47.030 --> 37:48.150]  Nailed it.
[37:54.380 --> 37:55.680]  Nice shot, Eric.
[37:55.880 --> 37:56.420]  That's a par.
[37:58.360 --> 37:59.440]  He's back, baby.
[38:03.380 --> 38:04.960]  He's closing the gap.
[38:05.040 --> 38:06.020]  Get away from me.
[38:07.460 --> 38:08.560]  Spider's just hanging out.
[38:08.680 --> 38:09.040]  No!
[38:09.300 --> 38:10.180]  Way too hard.
[38:10.540 --> 38:11.360]  What were you thinking?
[38:11.700 --> 38:12.140]  Closing the gap.
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.660]  The spider spooked you, dude.
[38:14.060 --> 38:15.020]  You got spider spooked.
[38:15.360 --> 38:16.700]  The spider freaked you out.
[38:17.160 --> 38:17.960]  It's spider sickness.
[38:18.280 --> 38:18.480]  There we go.
[38:21.760 --> 38:22.640]  Plus three.
[38:24.900 --> 38:25.440]  I'm right there.
[38:25.520 --> 38:26.180]  I'm on your heels.
[38:26.200 --> 38:27.140]  Oh my god.
[38:27.420 --> 38:28.480]  I'm on your heels, dude.
[38:28.800 --> 38:29.960]  Gavin's doing so well.
[38:30.020 --> 38:30.660]  Right there.
[38:30.760 --> 38:31.280]  So close.
[38:33.600 --> 38:34.740]  What the fuck?
[38:34.980 --> 38:35.440]  Where are we?
[38:36.100 --> 38:37.260]  That looks like a sun!
[38:37.900 --> 38:38.180]  Wow.
[38:38.180 --> 38:38.760]  So big.
[38:39.560 --> 38:40.780]  The middle one is a spider web.
[38:41.260 --> 38:41.560]  Wow.
[38:41.680 --> 38:42.220]  Alright, John Cena.
[38:42.420 --> 38:42.980]  What do you got?
[38:43.660 --> 38:44.180]  Oh, no.
[38:44.320 --> 38:44.920]  It's Gavin's turn.
[38:44.920 --> 38:45.120]  Gavin.
[38:45.300 --> 38:46.020]  Gavin Cena.
[38:46.800 --> 38:47.060]  Alright.
[38:47.600 --> 38:48.380]  Gavin Cena's up.
[38:48.380 --> 38:50.880]  Have you seen this?!
[38:55.540 --> 38:57.660]  Tell me, have you seen my ball?
[39:02.310 --> 39:05.910]  Wow, you gotta give it a little bit less beans than you think.
[39:06.650 --> 39:09.290]  That's the hard thing about beans, because the glow is so far.
[39:13.270 --> 39:14.370]  360 no-scope shit.
[39:14.470 --> 39:14.870]  What are you doing?
[39:21.170 --> 39:21.890]  You're insane.
[39:22.710 --> 39:23.610]  That's what I mean.
[39:24.370 --> 39:25.630]  You're an insane person.
[39:26.130 --> 39:27.370]  You're an insane person.
[39:28.030 --> 39:28.750]  Oh no.
[39:30.110 --> 39:32.570]  What's that black thing in front? Is that a hole or a rock?
[39:32.690 --> 39:34.790]  Like what is this? I don't know. I want to find out.
[39:35.090 --> 39:36.270]  I think it's a hole, isn't it?
[39:36.290 --> 39:36.990]  I think it is a hole.
[39:38.330 --> 39:39.950]  But then what's the shiny thing over there?
[39:40.830 --> 39:41.730]  Probably the hole in one.
[39:43.330 --> 39:44.550]  Oh yeah, it's just a pit.
[39:45.130 --> 39:46.030]  Oh, it is a pit.
[39:48.970 --> 39:49.410]  Hmm.
[39:50.270 --> 39:51.030]  Alright Gavin, what do you got?
[39:51.930 --> 39:52.610]  Alright, check this out.
[39:52.930 --> 39:54.170]  How many beans did you give it last time?
[39:54.450 --> 39:56.390]  I went to yellow and it was too much.
[39:57.370 --> 39:57.810]  Nice.
[39:58.830 --> 39:59.270]  No.
[40:00.250 --> 40:01.470]  How many beans was that?
[40:01.830 --> 40:04.330]  That was like probably 50% exactly.
[40:04.790 --> 40:05.070]  Okay.
[40:06.490 --> 40:07.390]  I mean, I don't know.
[40:08.750 --> 40:09.190]  53%.
[40:09.190 --> 40:09.850]  Hahaha.
[40:13.570 --> 40:14.550]  Next time just lie.
[40:14.990 --> 40:15.390]  Ah!
[40:16.090 --> 40:17.330]  How many beans was that?
[40:17.530 --> 40:19.830]  That was just about to touch yellow.
[40:22.490 --> 40:23.970]  So it's got to be in that
[40:24.870 --> 40:26.570]  greenish, closer to the green a little bit.
[40:26.730 --> 40:27.630]  Yeah, it's got to be the lime.
[40:27.710 --> 40:29.770]  I think it's got to be halfway into the lime green.
[40:29.870 --> 40:31.050]  I think that's got to be the spot.
[40:31.950 --> 40:33.710]  I think that's going to be too soft.
[40:34.050 --> 40:34.630]  Wasn't that?
[40:37.130 --> 40:37.470]  Hmm.
[40:40.890 --> 40:41.290]  Meanwhile...
[40:41.290 --> 40:41.690]  Hahaha.
[40:45.750 --> 40:46.150]  Meanwhile...
[40:51.190 --> 40:51.930]  Don't use that.
[40:51.970 --> 40:52.730]  It's going to make us jump.
[40:53.910 --> 40:54.310]  Hahaha.
[40:57.850 --> 40:59.770]  I'm going to look up spring powerups. Hold on.
[41:00.470 --> 41:00.810]  Hahaha.
[41:02.110 --> 41:03.390]  That's lime green right there, huh?
[41:03.550 --> 41:03.930]  Get me that.
[41:04.210 --> 41:04.490]  Aww.
[41:08.830 --> 41:09.630]  It was lime green.
[41:12.310 --> 41:12.750]  That's too soft.
[41:12.750 --> 41:13.930]  Could have been an angle problem there.
[41:13.930 --> 41:15.230]  Yeah, it's too soft.
[41:15.830 --> 41:16.330]  Way too soft.
[41:21.450 --> 41:21.890]  Dang.
[41:24.070 --> 41:25.110]  You got this, Andrew.
[41:25.690 --> 41:26.190]  Here we go.
[41:29.050 --> 41:29.490]  Perfect.
[41:31.290 --> 41:31.730]  Fuuuck.
[41:32.990 --> 41:33.870]  Nailed it.
[41:34.370 --> 41:35.610]  I'm zoning it in, though.
[41:36.030 --> 41:37.030]  Yeah, I want the hole in one.
[41:41.260 --> 41:42.640]  I mean, but it stopped being that.
[41:43.740 --> 41:44.300]  Eh.
[41:44.640 --> 41:46.380]  Sorry, I can't hear you on the sidelines.
[41:46.520 --> 41:47.000]  I'm busy.
[41:49.560 --> 41:50.640]  Oh, Geoff's going to
[41:50.640 --> 41:51.340]  take a shortcut?
[41:52.040 --> 41:52.600]  Wow.
[41:52.880 --> 41:54.700]  I can't believe that worked.
[41:55.660 --> 41:56.840]  What a play.
[41:58.740 --> 41:59.560]  That's insane.
[41:59.660 --> 42:00.720]  Way to go, Geoff.
[42:03.020 --> 42:04.500]  I don't think...
[42:04.500 --> 42:05.860]  Okay. You got this.
[42:06.160 --> 42:06.600]  Yeah, do it.
[42:08.960 --> 42:10.980]  We might work the other way, Gavin.
[42:13.300 --> 42:14.760]  Geoff gave me an idea.
[42:19.430 --> 42:20.290]  Damn it!
[42:21.670 --> 42:23.730]  I love all the ideas I'm seeing.
[42:23.930 --> 42:24.550]  You guys are
[42:25.470 --> 42:26.410]  going to figure it out.
[42:26.850 --> 42:29.250]  I mean, the actual way
[42:29.250 --> 42:30.550]  just seems completely impossible.
[42:32.790 --> 42:35.250]  Oh, wow.
[42:37.610 --> 42:39.410]  This game sucks.
[42:40.190 --> 42:41.030]  I agree with you.
[42:42.050 --> 42:42.850]  Bad game.
[42:43.250 --> 42:43.670]  Bad design.
[42:44.410 --> 42:45.250]  Oh, that's up a hill.
[42:46.830 --> 42:48.770]  It's a bad game. It's a bad design.
[42:48.950 --> 42:49.950]  Bad game. Bad design.
[42:50.290 --> 42:52.450]  If you do an AMA about it, bad guy.
[42:52.630 --> 42:53.970]  Why did Nintendo do this?
[42:54.050 --> 42:55.750]  Why did Nintendo do this?
[42:57.750 --> 42:58.890]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:59.010 --> 42:59.850]  That's it. Right there.
[43:01.190 --> 43:01.710]  Boom!
[43:03.370 --> 43:03.750]  What?
[43:11.130 --> 43:11.530]  Ooh.
[43:14.250 --> 43:15.270]  Oh, look at that.
[43:15.630 --> 43:16.030]  Nice.
[43:17.010 --> 43:18.630]  Oh, it almost went in the hole!
[43:19.030 --> 43:20.010]  Did you see that?
[43:20.030 --> 43:20.350]  Wow.
[43:20.350 --> 43:24.410]  That's the way to do it.
[43:26.150 --> 43:27.150]  Imagine if I did that on my
[43:27.150 --> 43:27.750]  first shot.
[43:29.210 --> 43:30.190]  Andrew's sticking with it.
[43:30.690 --> 43:31.510]  He's going to get it.
[43:32.330 --> 43:34.990]  I agree. I think it's an angle issue.
[43:40.230 --> 43:41.290]  You got this, Geoff.
[43:43.230 --> 43:43.630]  Oh!
[43:45.130 --> 43:45.530]  Oh!
[43:45.710 --> 43:46.690]  What are you doing?
[43:50.290 --> 43:52.110]  That's going to put me back to the start, isn't it?
[43:52.190 --> 43:53.370]  I don't know.
[43:54.490 --> 43:55.750]  I don't know.
[43:56.330 --> 43:57.270]  I'm pretty sure it will.
[43:57.930 --> 43:58.790]  I'm pretty sure it will.
[43:59.210 --> 44:00.870]  Oh, no.
[44:01.270 --> 44:02.990]  I don't think it would do that to you.
[44:04.890 --> 44:05.850]  Here we are.
[44:07.470 --> 44:08.190]  Here we are.
[44:08.630 --> 44:09.750]  I can't fucking believe it.
[44:09.750 --> 44:10.610]  I'm so sorry.
[44:11.690 --> 44:13.610]  I am! That wasn't on purpose!
[44:14.130 --> 44:15.410]  No, that was on purpose. I can tell.
[44:15.830 --> 44:17.070]  There's no way I'm
[44:17.070 --> 44:19.110]  good enough to do that on purpose.
[44:19.130 --> 44:21.730]  Everyone in the comments is going to leave a comment telling me
[44:21.730 --> 44:22.590]  that you did it on purpose.
[44:23.490 --> 44:24.790]  There's no way.
[44:26.410 --> 44:27.510]  You did it on purpose.
[44:29.750 --> 44:32.030]  That was so obvious that you did it on purpose.
[44:35.050 --> 44:35.530]  What?
[44:35.790 --> 44:37.150]  Did you forget the button?
[44:37.150 --> 44:39.250]  No, I got an idea.
[44:39.530 --> 44:41.570]  It's a little under what I wanted, but I got a plan.
[44:44.450 --> 44:46.770]  Geoff, if you roll off again...
[44:46.770 --> 44:47.430]  You suck.
[44:47.710 --> 44:50.430]  I did like half the power I did the last one.
[44:51.470 --> 44:52.650]  You're at a different angle, though.
[44:53.230 --> 44:54.170]  You're at a different angle.
[44:54.590 --> 44:55.750]  I am. I'm not playing.
[44:56.310 --> 44:57.490]  Where am I? Where's the hole?
[45:03.850 --> 45:04.250]  Whoa!
[45:04.790 --> 45:05.190]  What?
[45:06.390 --> 45:08.190]  I thought I could land on the troughs.
[45:09.590 --> 45:11.210]  I think it was going to hit a trough.
[45:11.410 --> 45:13.370]  It's a golf game that doesn't want you to be in the air.
[45:16.370 --> 45:18.030]  If that's in bounds, I'm a ship.
[45:20.850 --> 45:22.030]  Alright, what's Andrew's plan?
[45:22.230 --> 45:23.870]  Certainly let him play out longer than you.
[45:26.070 --> 45:26.830]  There we go.
[45:27.670 --> 45:29.690]  This is your plan still?
[45:30.130 --> 45:30.530]  Yeah.
[45:31.570 --> 45:32.450]  That's a real gag.
[45:32.470 --> 45:34.310]  It's not like it's any farther than Geoff.
[45:37.870 --> 45:39.010]  Stroke count, they're tied.
[45:39.150 --> 45:39.550]  I don't know.
[45:46.840 --> 45:47.240]  Nice.
[45:54.280 --> 45:54.680]  Oops.
[45:55.700 --> 45:56.460]  That could work.
[45:56.560 --> 45:57.940]  With less speed, that's the shot, I think.
[45:59.700 --> 46:01.420]  Your character broke her hips on that.
[46:03.440 --> 46:04.760]  You did it before, though.
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.780]  It put it right.
[46:09.780 --> 46:11.800]  At least you're tighter against the wall now.
[46:11.820 --> 46:12.900]  I was next to the hole.
[46:13.860 --> 46:16.320]  Alright, here's the finale of the plan.
[46:20.920 --> 46:23.880]  What the fuck?
[46:24.000 --> 46:24.980]  The game punished you.
[46:25.240 --> 46:26.060]  That was crazy.
[46:26.060 --> 46:27.820]  Oh my god.
[46:31.500 --> 46:32.840]  Punched through the flag.
[46:33.040 --> 46:34.100]  I feel like a fucking hero.
[46:34.700 --> 46:35.440]  You are.
[46:35.940 --> 46:38.340]  Yeah, you're a real fucking hero.
[46:41.360 --> 46:42.480]  I'm telling you.
[46:43.900 --> 46:44.880]  You got this.
[46:46.940 --> 46:48.120]  Alright, that was my plan.
[46:48.720 --> 46:49.060]  Oh yeah?
[46:50.000 --> 46:50.520]  Oh no.
[46:51.760 --> 46:53.260]  You know what to do.
[46:56.680 --> 46:57.120]  Oh.
[46:57.760 --> 46:58.860]  Where did he go?
[46:59.520 --> 47:00.180]  In the water.
[47:03.840 --> 47:11.760]  Now, I didn't do that on purpose like Jack.
[47:12.520 --> 47:13.460]  There we go.
[47:13.640 --> 47:14.740]  That was the plan.
[47:15.540 --> 47:18.740]  You have to activate the suck tube or whatever too.
[47:18.820 --> 47:19.500]  Don't forget to hit the button.
[47:20.200 --> 47:20.540]  There you go.
[47:21.500 --> 47:22.760]  Oh hell yeah.
[47:22.880 --> 47:24.140]  He just got sucked in too.
[47:24.460 --> 47:26.200]  Only one behind me I think.
[47:29.460 --> 47:30.420]  Oh he's...
[47:30.420 --> 47:31.280]  There you go, you're right there.
[47:32.400 --> 47:34.380]  This is about to be a war of attrition.
[47:35.380 --> 47:36.540]  I wonder if I can...
[47:37.440 --> 47:38.080]  Oh my god.
[47:38.180 --> 47:39.660]  Oh I made it.
[47:40.160 --> 47:41.320]  Where did I go?
[47:41.840 --> 47:43.060]  I made it.
[47:44.800 --> 47:46.040]  Get me there.
[47:47.720 --> 47:49.880]  I don't see Eric anywhere.
[47:50.160 --> 47:50.500]  Nope.
[47:52.560 --> 47:53.020]  Okay.
[47:53.520 --> 47:54.200]  You're fine.
[47:56.640 --> 47:58.500]  I needed to get out of the corner.
[47:58.780 --> 48:00.300]  I wish I hit it a little bit harder.
[48:00.820 --> 48:01.360]  But it's okay.
[48:01.440 --> 48:03.980]  I have about 26 more strokes to get there.
[48:06.540 --> 48:08.240]  Until what? Someone else gains on you?
[48:08.340 --> 48:08.800]  Yes.
[48:09.360 --> 48:10.300]  Oh fuck you.
[48:10.700 --> 48:10.900]  Wow.
[48:10.900 --> 48:11.340]  Wow.
[48:15.400 --> 48:16.060]  Here we go.
[48:16.940 --> 48:18.900]  Alright we're lined up now boys.
[48:19.880 --> 48:20.280]  He's got you.
[48:20.420 --> 48:21.760]  Just trying to find the end of this level.
[48:22.260 --> 48:23.200]  Get me out of here.
[48:26.000 --> 48:26.440]  Twelve.
[48:30.600 --> 48:31.860]  Which one are you going for?
[48:32.120 --> 48:32.400]  Middle.
[48:33.240 --> 48:34.540]  Who gives a schmist?
[48:37.040 --> 48:39.020]  Who gives a schmist?
[48:39.600 --> 48:42.180]  Can we call this video who gives a schmist?
[48:43.620 --> 48:44.860]  I hit the spider web.
[48:47.460 --> 48:49.180]  Save the shield you might need it.
[48:49.460 --> 48:50.900]  Who gives a schmist?
[48:51.560 --> 48:51.880]  What the?
[48:53.700 --> 48:54.140]  Oh.
[48:55.080 --> 48:56.960]  At first I thought it shot you back to the start.
[48:56.960 --> 48:58.520]  Hey remember when I was down here the first time?
[48:58.720 --> 49:01.560]  And then somebody knocked me off on purpose because they were jealous of how good I was doing?
[49:01.560 --> 49:02.860]  You've been down here before?
[49:03.640 --> 49:04.880]  Yeah I was right over here.
[49:05.040 --> 49:06.820]  I can't believe there's no wall there.
[49:06.980 --> 49:09.440]  Because you slid back and forth along there without falling in.
[49:09.860 --> 49:10.080]  Yep.
[49:10.480 --> 49:12.320]  It was impressive until Geoff found you.
[49:13.760 --> 49:14.540]  That's true.
[49:15.300 --> 49:15.780]  Wow!
[49:16.740 --> 49:17.800]  The game took mercy.
[49:18.120 --> 49:20.620]  The game said we have to move on.
[49:21.500 --> 49:23.280]  This video is going to be way too long.
[49:23.980 --> 49:25.260]  Imagine if we'd done 18.
[49:25.940 --> 49:26.420]  We did.
[49:27.100 --> 49:29.480]  What are you talking about?
[49:29.480 --> 49:30.480]  Yeah we did 18.
[49:31.020 --> 49:32.100]  Yes this is 18.
[49:32.440 --> 49:33.600]  We were scared it would be too short.
[49:34.060 --> 49:36.420]  We were scared it was too short?
[49:37.500 --> 49:38.880]  It's been 50 minutes.
[49:40.940 --> 49:41.420]  Yeah.
[49:41.800 --> 49:41.940]  Yeah.
[49:42.500 --> 49:44.620]  Looking back on it, it seems like it was a mistake.
[49:45.580 --> 49:46.520]  We were all there.
[49:46.780 --> 49:47.040]  We've done 18 before?
[49:47.720 --> 49:48.840]  We always do 9.
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.080]  We always do 9 and it's too short so we do another and I figured why bother.
[49:53.600 --> 49:55.280]  The last time was like 2 hours.
[49:57.400 --> 49:59.660]  Remember we got stuck in that hole for ages.
[50:01.160 --> 50:02.380]  You mean the one we just did?
[50:04.360 --> 50:05.500]  That's not solid.
[50:05.940 --> 50:06.200]  That pillar.
[50:07.120 --> 50:08.500]  You just go through that pillar.
[50:08.900 --> 50:09.720]  Is that the course?
[50:11.120 --> 50:11.520]  No.
[50:12.540 --> 50:13.340]  It's behind it.
[50:13.420 --> 50:15.380]  You shoot it here and it comes back around.
[50:15.680 --> 50:16.220]  Like dog legs.
[50:17.340 --> 50:18.740]  Come back around.
[50:19.840 --> 50:20.980]  Less beans than you think.
[50:22.580 --> 50:23.300]  That's nice.
[50:23.460 --> 50:23.780]  There you go.
[50:23.780 --> 50:24.300]  You did it.
[50:24.480 --> 50:27.500]  I tried to do the same thing, I hit it a little too hard.
[50:30.620 --> 50:31.420]  Oh man.
[50:31.680 --> 50:33.440]  Looking for a solid 20 from each of you now.
[50:34.380 --> 50:35.760]  You put me back in competition.
[50:40.780 --> 50:41.580]  He missed.
[50:41.940 --> 50:42.680]  He missed.
[50:43.280 --> 50:44.020]  What do you mean?
[50:46.440 --> 50:47.240]  Not enough.
[50:48.500 --> 50:49.260]  Get your shit together.
[50:50.320 --> 50:51.380]  Shit my ass together.
[50:55.460 --> 50:56.580]  There we go.
[50:56.720 --> 50:57.780]  I like this music.
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.080]  It's really peaceful.
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.040]  Yeah, peaceful.
[51:01.760 --> 51:03.880]  I'm feeling at peace, that's how I feel.
[51:04.980 --> 51:06.040]  Eric, you never feel at peace.
[51:06.380 --> 51:08.480]  I feel the same way when it's looped 18 times.
[51:09.860 --> 51:10.900]  We should...
[51:10.900 --> 51:11.480]  What?
[51:12.740 --> 51:14.760]  We should have somebody go through
[51:14.760 --> 51:16.440]  and watch all of these videos
[51:16.440 --> 51:17.300]  after they're all out.
[51:17.580 --> 51:20.280]  And pick the 9 most difficult holes
[51:20.280 --> 51:22.260]  for us to complete and we should have to do
[51:22.260 --> 51:23.720]  like a master's round.
[51:23.740 --> 51:24.340]  Oh my god.
[51:24.800 --> 51:25.640]  That's great.
[51:29.200 --> 51:30.400]  Well, the spinning disc
[51:30.400 --> 51:32.060]  from the last one was on this one.
[51:33.620 --> 51:35.620]  Well, I think you might get that 20 wish.
[51:42.280 --> 51:43.620]  We're gonna have to stop now.
[51:50.840 --> 51:52.960]  What the fuck?
[51:54.880 --> 51:57.240]  That was crazy.
[51:57.980 --> 51:58.600]  What?
[52:00.240 --> 52:02.180]  That was truly impressive.
[52:02.320 --> 52:03.120]  That was nuts.
[52:05.360 --> 52:06.760]  I'm back at the beginning.
[52:07.100 --> 52:07.700]  That was nuts.
[52:09.140 --> 52:11.400]  I have to do it again. I already did this.
[52:13.880 --> 52:14.740]  Where's the hole?
[52:15.480 --> 52:15.980]  Right there.
[52:18.420 --> 52:19.900]  Eric was really close to it.
[52:20.080 --> 52:21.600]  I was very close. I was super close.
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.540]  I was like locked in. I was doing great.
[52:24.320 --> 52:25.040]  Good bounce.
[52:25.320 --> 52:27.840]  That was an impossible bounce.
[52:28.120 --> 52:28.380]  Oh, stop.
[52:30.880 --> 52:31.660]  Okay, now remember,
[52:31.780 --> 52:33.760]  if you hit that at the wrong angle, you'll go back to the beginning.
[52:34.580 --> 52:35.560]  They don't have a problem
[52:35.560 --> 52:36.300]  doing that to you.
[52:36.760 --> 52:38.200]  Unless you bounce off that wall just right.
[52:43.180 --> 52:43.740]  Failed it.
[52:44.800 --> 52:45.700]  And you like to play
[52:45.700 --> 52:46.880]  dangerously with that angle.
[52:47.980 --> 52:48.880]  That's my shield.
[52:53.340 --> 52:54.040]  I'm shielding
[52:54.040 --> 52:55.660]  myself. What are you trying to do to me?
[52:56.160 --> 52:57.800]  You just did it right next to me. I thought you were trying to
[52:57.800 --> 52:59.660]  murder me. I'm worried about you.
[53:00.120 --> 53:01.540]  Andrew, I think you have one play here.
[53:01.720 --> 53:02.160]  Oh, okay.
[53:04.240 --> 53:04.960]  Oh, man.
[53:05.440 --> 53:07.020]  Get a little close to that shield. I'll take it.
[53:13.160 --> 53:13.740]  I'm not doing it.
[53:13.740 --> 53:15.020]  Let's just tap in.
[53:15.260 --> 53:16.560]  You can do it.
[53:29.050 --> 53:30.090]  Easy peasy.
[53:30.650 --> 53:31.550]  Easy peasy.
[53:32.910 --> 53:35.350]  And we have two podcasts after this.
[53:35.970 --> 53:36.150]  True.
[53:36.370 --> 53:37.430]  We have two after this?
[53:38.450 --> 53:38.970]  Geez.
[53:39.910 --> 53:40.850]  You've done that to us.
[53:40.850 --> 53:41.410]  Yeah.
[53:44.670 --> 53:46.370]  I don't know what to tell you.
[53:53.550 --> 53:54.370]  Murderous rage.
[53:55.550 --> 53:56.910]  Pointlessly bullish.
[53:57.510 --> 53:58.290]  I feel my
[53:58.790 --> 53:59.470]  rage is
[54:00.750 --> 54:01.430]  becoming
[54:02.650 --> 54:02.990]  overwhelming.
[54:03.730 --> 54:06.990]  The master of angles has done it again.
[54:09.670 --> 54:10.730]  What are you doing?
[54:10.730 --> 54:11.270]  What are you...
[54:11.270 --> 54:13.130]  What the fuck is wrong with you?
[54:15.130 --> 54:16.310]  Get in there.
[54:17.350 --> 54:18.710]  Oh, nice putt.
[54:19.330 --> 54:19.870]  Good putt.
[54:23.170 --> 54:24.650]  I couldn't figure out who to declare
[54:24.650 --> 54:25.610]  war on, so I just left.
[54:28.050 --> 54:29.130]  Nice putt.
[54:29.430 --> 54:30.630]  And let me round out this
[54:30.630 --> 54:32.070]  putting streak.
[54:33.610 --> 54:34.730]  Triple putt.
[54:37.130 --> 54:37.650]  Fuck!
[54:50.300 --> 54:51.840]  We're almost halfway there, guys.
[54:54.500 --> 54:55.500]  Oh, a spring hole.
[54:55.800 --> 54:57.860]  Oh, spring hole, but that's gonna bounce all of us.
[54:58.380 --> 55:00.140]  Yeah, it's gonna make
[55:00.140 --> 55:01.340]  everybody jump.
[55:01.940 --> 55:02.400]  Funny joke.
[55:06.200 --> 55:06.680]  Ah!
[55:10.800 --> 55:15.080]  Ah, shit.
[55:15.700 --> 55:16.380]  Oh, I jumped.
[55:17.960 --> 55:18.860]  Should've jumped better.
[55:22.180 --> 55:23.300]  Don't make me do it.
[55:24.040 --> 55:25.360]  Please don't make me do it.
[55:28.060 --> 55:29.640]  He's in the fucking way, though.
[55:30.020 --> 55:30.620]  I am.
[55:34.040 --> 55:35.260]  Fuck, do I wanna do this?
[55:35.260 --> 55:35.780]  Yeah.
[55:37.380 --> 55:38.440]  Just gonna hit Andrew.
[55:38.860 --> 55:39.820]  Oh, nice!
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.980]  Oh, great shot.
[55:43.200 --> 55:44.000]  It's gotta be a tooth.
[55:44.680 --> 55:46.220]  Yeah, should be a tooth.
[55:52.080 --> 55:53.360]  It looks like you can also
[55:53.360 --> 55:54.360]  just go around.
[55:55.040 --> 55:55.440]  You can.
[55:56.500 --> 55:59.260]  Oh, yeah, that's what the arrow's for.
[56:02.810 --> 56:04.310]  I thought it was a C.
[56:06.910 --> 56:07.090]  Yeah.
[56:08.190 --> 56:11.030]  Remember what I said about going around?
[56:11.530 --> 56:12.690]  I don't think...
[56:12.690 --> 56:14.410]  I don't know if I can go that way now.
[56:14.890 --> 56:17.330]  No, it's...
[56:17.330 --> 56:17.970]  Well, maybe.
[56:18.310 --> 56:19.110]  You can thread it.
[56:21.770 --> 56:22.650]  I hit...
[56:22.650 --> 56:24.070]  Boy, I'm with you guys.
[56:24.170 --> 56:26.130]  I hit that spring button, I did not spring.
[56:26.630 --> 56:27.770]  You hit it and Nick jumped.
[56:28.130 --> 56:30.110]  As soon as I got it...
[56:31.970 --> 56:32.590]  Funny joke.
[56:34.650 --> 56:36.090]  Real funny guy, huh?
[56:36.410 --> 56:38.430]  As soon as I got it, I was fucking jamming on the button.
[56:38.590 --> 56:38.970]  Nice!
[56:39.390 --> 56:40.130]  There you go.
[56:40.250 --> 56:40.630]  Nice!
[56:42.470 --> 56:43.690]  Way to go!
[56:45.290 --> 56:45.670]  Eagle!
[56:46.030 --> 56:46.630]  Go Eagles!
[56:48.430 --> 56:49.850]  That was awesome, dude.
[56:50.670 --> 56:52.250]  That's cool because you're dressed like the Eagles fan, too.
[56:52.410 --> 56:53.130]  That's really exciting.
[56:53.890 --> 56:56.590]  I'm not in the position to do it the right way, so...
[56:58.090 --> 56:58.970]  God forgive me.
[57:00.590 --> 57:00.970]  Well...
[57:00.970 --> 57:02.530]  Are you fucking serious?
[57:03.250 --> 57:04.670]  It's still out of bounds, dude.
[57:04.970 --> 57:07.270]  He rolled for a while.
[57:07.550 --> 57:07.990]  Are you fucking serious?
[57:18.230 --> 57:21.270]  Have you angled yourself so far off track?
[57:23.410 --> 57:25.090]  You might make it through one window.
[57:26.750 --> 57:27.370]  There you go.
[57:28.050 --> 57:29.770]  It's here and matched to the button.
[57:30.010 --> 57:31.150]  I'm trying, buddy.
[57:32.690 --> 57:34.690]  Oh, you're a real piece of shit.
[57:35.870 --> 57:36.870]  Come get it!
[57:37.570 --> 57:38.170]  Oh, that sucks.
[57:39.450 --> 57:40.870]  Right where I need to go.
[57:42.470 --> 57:43.090]  Maybe I'll just...
[57:43.090 --> 57:43.630]  You can go up that way.
[57:43.870 --> 57:44.990]  You can bounce off the top there.
[57:46.110 --> 57:46.510]  Nope.
[57:48.130 --> 57:48.930]  Don't go that way.
[57:49.310 --> 57:51.070]  Is that a free pool up there?
[57:51.390 --> 57:51.630]  Yeah.
[57:51.630 --> 57:52.950]  Did you hit it?
[57:53.870 --> 57:55.370]  It's probably up there to the left also.
[57:56.070 --> 57:56.230]  Yeah.
[57:58.750 --> 57:59.810]  Way too slow.
[58:00.310 --> 58:00.970]  No way!
[58:01.270 --> 58:01.950]  He's doing it!
[58:02.170 --> 58:05.190]  He made it through one!
[58:07.630 --> 58:08.730]  Two to go!
[58:09.530 --> 58:10.950]  No more electricity.
[58:12.290 --> 58:13.570]  Shitbox shitbag.
[58:17.280 --> 58:18.560]  One more to go!
[58:18.560 --> 58:18.720]  Oh!
[58:21.680 --> 58:22.720]  Come and get it, boys.
[58:28.460 --> 58:29.300]  Okay.
[58:35.800 --> 58:37.280]  18 holes.
[58:37.620 --> 58:38.820]  18 holes.
[58:39.080 --> 58:40.520]  18 holes.
[58:40.660 --> 58:41.500]  We have 10 more.
[58:41.980 --> 58:42.340]  18.
[58:44.800 --> 58:48.940]  Oh, what a shot!
[58:48.940 --> 58:49.600]  Nice!
[58:56.770 --> 58:57.290]  Alright.
[58:58.910 --> 59:00.190]  That was a scenic
[59:00.190 --> 59:01.090]  tour of this section.
[59:06.140 --> 59:06.660]  Nice.
[59:06.860 --> 59:08.040]  That worked. Nice job.
[59:08.780 --> 59:10.940]  Look at that. Doing Tony Hawk
[59:10.940 --> 59:12.700]  type shit. Doing ramp stuff.
[59:13.540 --> 59:14.060]  Explosion.
[59:15.440 --> 59:15.960]  Celebration.
[59:24.930 --> 59:26.930]  Well, you're lined up with that short one. That's pretty good.
[59:26.930 --> 59:28.310]  Nuh-uh.
[59:28.370 --> 59:30.370]  Not really.
[59:31.710 --> 59:32.050]  There you go.
[59:32.430 --> 59:34.910]  I can't see. There's a freaking power up
[59:34.910 --> 59:35.430]  in my face.
[59:37.010 --> 59:38.170]  Trust your instincts.
[59:39.670 --> 59:40.330]  Instincts this.
[59:41.890 --> 59:42.370]  Nice.
[59:43.150 --> 59:44.150]  That wasn't bad.
[59:44.530 --> 59:45.570]  Yeah, nice instincts, dude.
[59:45.830 --> 59:46.610]  Okay, that was bad.
[59:47.390 --> 59:49.030]  You're a monster.
[59:49.270 --> 59:49.930]  Kind of blocked.
[59:52.390 --> 59:52.950]  It's in the holes.
[59:52.950 --> 59:53.830]  Nice putt.
[59:53.930 --> 59:55.730]  It's in the holes.
[59:56.810 --> 59:57.350]  Dang.
[59:57.810 --> 59:58.670]  End this misery.
[01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:01.050]  On this hole.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.700]  You got it.
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:07.960]  Just like that.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.340]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.520]  Oh.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:13.600]  God.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.640]  What you doing?
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.620]  What are you doing?
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.560]  Where you going?
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.200]  Yeah, just do that.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.380]  Yeah, you can bank it.
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.280]  Oh, I see.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:33.520]  It's in the hole.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:34.980]  It's in the hole.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.880]  What a shot. It's in the hole.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.580]  That worked way better than I thought it would.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.140]  Cool.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.640]  You can just do what Gavin did.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.420]  Go to the bank.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.780]  Oh, it's open.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.260]  No, no.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.360]  That's enough.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Fine, fine, fine.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.660]  That's fine.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.860]  I can live with that.
[01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.190]  Ten left.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:14.640]  Dang it.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:15.800]  Wow.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.080]  Good try though.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.220]  Less of a good try.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.780]  I didn't say anything on that one.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.000]  On to the next.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.780]  Almost halfway there.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.170]  And the final hole of the first nine.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.700]  So we can just end it
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.760]  and then just re-pick the last nine levels, right?
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.420]  100%.
[01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:45.020]  Hell yeah. Absolutely.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.220]  Sounds great.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.920]  Picked them in order. Not a problem.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.700]  Sounds great.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.560]  Welcome to the final hole of this video.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:55.460]  Okay.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:56.940]  Secret fountain.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.020]  Whoa.
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.100]  What the damn?
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.220]  I don't know.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.520]  Is that an owl?
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.220]  Oh yeah, you want to go through that.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.900]  That's where the hole in one is.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:30.400]  Is it not?
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.100]  If you can hit it, yeah. Big time.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:33.300]  Yeah!
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.140]  Nailed it.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.120]  Aw.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.140]  Just missed it.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.160]  Hey, what's up?
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.200]  Hey, what's up?
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:46.960]  Here comes
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.420]  Eric. Here comes Eric.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.840]  Going for the hole in one.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.540]  It's not a hole in one.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.960]  The wind stopped?
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.960]  I didn't know it stopped.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.460]  I'm like, alright, cool. I have to hit it a little bit softer
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.960]  so I get blown up to whatever is on top
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.620]  over there.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.260]  And the wind's...
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.780]  Wind'll do that.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.380]  Alright, wind's on.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.660]  That's why they say the weather is unpredictable.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.100]  Wind's off.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.460]  Wind's on.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.360]  Wind's on.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.240]  Wind's off.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:19.860]  Fuck!
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.440]  Come on, keep going.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.600]  Keep rolling.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.500]  Keep rolling.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.580]  Oh, just missed the free shot.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.200]  Oh.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.540]  And there
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.640]  they all sat.
[01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:39.170]  Alright, where to?
[01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:41.370]  That way.
[01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:43.590]  Yeah, I guess just like
[01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.890]  a little bit of...
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.580]  I feel like
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.540]  there's like a fear of what's around the next
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.640]  corner. Yeah, there is.
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.660]  Because it's misery.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.780]  The next corner sucks.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.940]  Well, it loves company, so...
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.620]  Oh, damn.
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.620]  I definitely thought he was getting blasted.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.420]  Is there a wall blocking the hole?
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.080]  Yeah, I think we have to go around it.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.780]  Looks like it.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.960]  Perfect one. You're set.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.920]  Get on up there.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.560]  Oh, nice!
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.140]  Oh no!
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.580]  Who could've seen that coming?
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.440]  I thought that lip would've saved you.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.940]  It was like a whale lip.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.100]  Bad news, baby.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.040]  You're just enough to tickle.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.320]  That might be the most
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.060]  nothing cool back of all time.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.760]  Thanks for noticing.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:46.820]  Andrew.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.280]  Andrew.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.240]  What are you trying to do?
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.540]  Andrew?
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.160]  I don't know.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.560]  I don't know.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.400]  Hey!
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.240]  Hey!
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.080]  I was just using you to stop.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.020]  Oh, okay.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.020]  I didn't think it'd fuck with you.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:11.740]  Yeah, yeah. Use him to stop.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.440]  Use him to stop.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.580]  Can you do that?
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.760]  I knew he didn't have the guts.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.740]  No, I just want to get out of it, you know?
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:29.700]  I just want to get in that hole.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.680]  I understand.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.160]  85% beans.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:47.820]  It might be in the hole.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:48.420]  Oh!
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.560]  God, that was close.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:51.900]  Flag lifted, though.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:54.980]  Alright, I'm up here, though.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:56.560]  For how long?
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.080]  I'm looking to get it.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:57.180]  I'm looking to get it.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.140]  I'm looking to get it done, boys.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.420]  For how long?
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.680]  Careful, Geoff's nearby.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.460]  I didn't hurt Gavin.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.480]  I put him in the...
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.140]  I was using you to stop.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.380]  Why don't you just do what Gavin did?
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:13.700]  Full beans?
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.320]  Oh!
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:19.860]  Wow!
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.720]  Oh, fuck.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.220]  Pfft.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.400]  You gonna do the same, Gavin?
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:28.740]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:29.800]  Who's this?
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:30.860]  Andrew.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:32.920]  What'd you say to me?
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.920]  I said, you gonna do the same?
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.880]  It didn't sound like a threatening question at all.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.320]  It wasn't, it was like, you going for it?
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.300]  And he was like, what?
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.780]  I'll show you what I'm going for.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.660]  That was shit.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:50.860]  Dog.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.320]  You wouldn't.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.200]  You're gonna hit Gavin.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:56.400]  You wouldn't.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.240]  You hit Geoff.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:06:59.740]  Oh, no.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.300]  Oh, okay.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.400]  You just, like, circled each other.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:04.920]  Yeah.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.900]  The west side story fight.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.440]  What are you doing back here?
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.160]  Start snapping.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.580]  I'm gonna deflect.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.180]  I'm gonna bounce it.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.480]  That's a shame.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.260]  That's a real shame.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.840]  You can tell it's a shame by the way Nick laughed at it.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.360]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.420]  Oh, come on, you little dickhead.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:33.900]  Get in there.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:34.560]  Thank you.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.280]  That's close.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.060]  This is not the place you want to stop short.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.800]  There's about to be a really exciting hole.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.100]  What'd you say?
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.840]  I said it was a really exciting hole.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.620]  You won't do it.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.500]  Do you want to say anything else?
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.740]  No, this is a really exciting hole.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.480]  You won't fucking do it.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.340]  Wait, wait, chicken noises.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.240]  Chicken noises.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.640]  Are you serious?
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.760]  The thing I hate ultimately.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.120]  Oh, I'm all the way back down too.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:10.580]  Join me.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.700]  I love how easily Gavin's influenced by other people's chicken noises.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:14.260]  Yeah.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.640]  If you drove a car, I'd go over to your house and pop your tires.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.480]  Well, he mainly speaks bird.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.880]  Just wait until he takes his trash out and
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.860]  pin him against them again.
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.240]  No, don't make my neighbors talk to me again.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.360]  Hit him with my car again.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.700]  I'm just
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.580]  flopping over my bins onto the lawn.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:38.000]  What a shot.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.600]  What a shot.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.040]  Hi, everybody's up here.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:42.680]  Gang's all here.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.280]  Emily did that to me the other day as well.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:46.620]  What?
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.680]  More people hit you with their car?
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.660]  Pretend to run me over while I was on a walk.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:53.180]  She told me about that.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.960]  She told me you had big headphones on and she scared the shit out of you.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:56.960]  Yeah, it was scary.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.560]  You just had no idea? That's so funny.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.560]  But then she was on the wrong side of the road
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.840]  to run me over and then another car came
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.520]  and she got in trouble.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.060]  She got in trouble.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.680]  She got in trouble.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.340]  Alright, where'd he go?
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.620]  She's like, I tried to hit him going around a blind curve
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.940]  but there was another car coming too.
[01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:26.650]  I think that brings the total
[01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:28.630]  amount of people who pretend to run me over
[01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:30.350]  by running me over a little bit to five.
[01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:32.370]  Andrew, Andrew, Andrew.
[01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.970]  You know, at some point
[01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.410]  you gotta think that says more about you than them.
[01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.970]  Make it six.
[01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.210]  Why'd you do that?
[01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.390]  Why'd you do that?
[01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:53.110]  No way!
[01:09:57.370 --> 01:09:58.090]  Insane!
[01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:01.010]  Oh, that might have helped him.
[01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:01.870]  Unreal.
[01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:07.770]  We got a triangle formation.
[01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:08.990]  Yes we do.
[01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:13.010]  We got a real standoff here.
[01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:14.770]  Wrong ball, I've never hit you.
[01:10:19.210 --> 01:10:19.650]  Goddamn!
[01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:25.410]  There you go.
[01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.410]  I feel like it's not a fair fight.
[01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:30.990]  If we were to do the full 18 holes, which we're not
[01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.790]  in this video, we still wouldn't be halfway done.
[01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:35.250]  At this moment.
[01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:35.490]  Oh!
[01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.870]  Fuck.
[01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:44.950]  You gotta clip him more to the left.
[01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:46.070]  He's got a decision to make.
[01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.590]  If you go to the right.
[01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.950]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:50.310]  No.
[01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:53.490]  Oh, did I miss?
[01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:57.590]  Did you miss?
[01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:01.170]  You missed. He's like right behind.
[01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:02.250]  You didn't miss.
[01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:03.570]  Oh, you moved me a little bit.
[01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.990]  Oh.
[01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:08.750]  My back's to the open.
[01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:13.010]  Oh, come on!
[01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.810]  Wow.
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.720]  I'm really enjoying the showdown.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.560]  Getting in the hole.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.720]  Yeah? Yep.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:26.780]  Fuck.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:27.040]  It's in the hole.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.460]  It's in the hole.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:29.480]  Shit.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:30.540]  It's in the hole.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.680]  Gavin is his pick of the litter.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:36.580]  Alright, Gavin.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.520]  This is your litter pick.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:39.600]  Okay.
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:42.460]  Look at Andrew. You could just send him tumbling
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.920]  back down the hill with a well-placed shot.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.340]  But then everyone would have ignored
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:47.560]  Eric for a really long time.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.500]  You're right. Fuck him. Get him.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.060]  Oops.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:52.920]  It's in the hole!
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.020]  Oh.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:59.370]  This is why we can't
[01:11:59.370 --> 01:11:59.570]  play.
[01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:01.810]  18 holes.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.500]  Go around.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:08.940]  Go around.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.260]  Yes!
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:10.920]  Oh!
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.600]  The lip!
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.260]  It's not even a sound effect
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:19.140]  for when balls hit.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.120]  It means nothing
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:22.840]  in this game.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.120]  It's like they didn't even intend for it to be a part of the game.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.300]  Nobody will hit each other on purpose.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.460]  Yeah, why would they do that?
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.140]  If you'd hit him, you'd have gone in the hole.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.840]  Oh, he's on the other side.
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:40.960]  I don't think I can get him.
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.820]  Yes, you can. Look at him. Go left.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.480]  Oh, you really should have sunk that.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.520]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:48.780]  Alright.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.340]  That's gonna be a problem.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:52.740]  That's gonna be a real problem.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.460]  Gavin bounces off you to score.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.100]  Yeah.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.260]  What?
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.720]  I swear to God, I almost shit my pants when you did that.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.220]  What?
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.880]  That was a dark fart.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.380]  It's gone.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.280]  Dark fart.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.900]  You might be back at the beginning.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.960]  Oh, it's right in front of me!
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:17.880]  What?
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:19.580]  Invincible!
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.180]  Stop the time!
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:22.860]  Invincible!
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.460]  Oh, you fucked yourself.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:28.620]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:40.400]  Oh, this is the moment we've been waiting for.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.080]  Goodbye, Gavin.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.140]  Oh, no.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.740]  The depth has been flipped.
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:51.840]  Oh, no.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:55.700]  In the hole.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:57.180]  What?
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.340]  I guess there's just no bouncing you over.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.740]  It's like a safety lip.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:02.480]  Yeah.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.480]  Didn't work on Eric the first time.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:05.640]  No.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.060]  Not from yourself.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.320]  I bet you can put yourself in the hole hitting him.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.320]  What?
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.460]  How?
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.400]  No! It's right back to where it was!
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.000]  Oh, no.
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.780]  How do I readjust?
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:28.700]  Bawk.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:31.700]  Make a base.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:41.600]  Perfect.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.440]  That was it?
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.040]  You can play a nine-hole version of this game where you can only get a ball in a hole by hitting somebody else's ball in a hole.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:55.620]  That's great.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.920]  Oh, man, this might be it.
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.640]  Gavin's not gonna be able to get me.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.460]  We're too far apart.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.260]  He was drawn to it for a moment.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:06.660]  That's it.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.040]  Nice putt.
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:09.720]  Thank you.
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.020]  Alright, now it's Eric's turn.
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:14.240]  You can make this.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.140]  I don't think so.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.220]  You gotta believe in yourself.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:20.820]  Didn't believe.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.240]  Oh!
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:21.840]  Oh!
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:23.540]  Sad.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:25.840]  Full beans.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.780]  Well, boys, we did it!
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.300]  Let's see the final standings.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.620]  Nine holes?
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:34.540]  Yeah!
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.360]  Wow, it got really close there, though.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.000]  Really close at the end.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.560]  Thank you for watching the nine-hole version of this.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.880]  We'll have another additional nine holes some other time.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.040]  Maybe Nick'll play.
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:47.740]  I mean, hell.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.620]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.320]  Check out the podcast.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.500]  Check out patreon.com.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.420]  I'm glad we're almost done with DLC in this game.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.520]  Jesus Christ.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.420]  We'll see you next time. Bye!
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.200]  File complaint.
