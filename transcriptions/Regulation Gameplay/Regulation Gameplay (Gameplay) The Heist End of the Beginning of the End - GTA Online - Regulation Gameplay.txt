[00:00.560 --> 00:02.760]  Oh, we're starting the heist! It's the heist finale!
[00:02.960 --> 00:03.020]  Woo!
[00:05.060 --> 00:08.540]  Welcome... to the end of the series of heists.
[00:08.860 --> 00:09.120]  Yeah!
[00:09.220 --> 00:10.520]  But there's one more heist after this.
[00:11.780 --> 00:15.300]  You're so lucky, Eric. You didn't have to wait years for all this stuff to come out.
[00:15.540 --> 00:15.880]  Yeah!
[00:16.560 --> 00:20.520]  I waited the initial six months when GTA Online was coming out,
[00:20.540 --> 00:24.140]  and I played it when it came out, and then for a little while after.
[00:24.600 --> 00:27.500]  But the heists came out, and I went, I don't want to do this, so I stopped playing.
[00:29.520 --> 00:29.840]  Wow.
[00:30.080 --> 00:33.160]  You're the reverse of 95% of the online community.
[00:33.720 --> 00:34.920]  But I don't play games online.
[00:35.740 --> 00:37.200]  Yeah, totally. Makes sense.
[00:37.600 --> 00:40.980]  I really like the casino heist. I'm excited for us to get there.
[00:40.980 --> 00:43.380]  Oh, that's going to be fun. I don't know anything about it, but that sounds cool.
[00:43.560 --> 00:44.320]  I've never finished those.
[00:45.600 --> 00:48.380]  The one where you go into the casino, and you rob from the vaults,
[00:48.440 --> 00:50.260]  and you have to... it's a whole, like, ocean...
[00:50.260 --> 00:50.880]  Did I do that one?
[00:50.980 --> 00:51.560]  Kind of 11.
[00:52.020 --> 00:52.560]  I don't know.
[00:53.720 --> 00:54.460]  You'd be the one.
[00:55.240 --> 00:55.560]  I don't know.
[00:55.620 --> 00:56.620]  I feel like you should be qualified.
[00:57.140 --> 00:59.880]  If someone in the audience can let me know if I've done that or not.
[01:02.580 --> 01:05.720]  Leave a comment below. Slap that like button.
[01:05.920 --> 01:08.120]  Don't forget to subscribe and let Gavin know.
[01:08.320 --> 01:09.580]  Has he done that heist?
[01:11.140 --> 01:13.780]  People know my own experiences so much better than me.
[01:14.420 --> 01:15.020]  Oh, of course.
[01:15.840 --> 01:18.180]  It's so funny, though, to direct comments that way.
[01:18.600 --> 01:21.640]  Comment in the video if you know if I had a sandwich yesterday,
[01:21.840 --> 01:24.580]  because I don't remember. I think I may have. That may have been Tuesday.
[01:24.580 --> 01:27.520]  I shouldn't be here. See, I should be with Trevor.
[01:27.700 --> 01:30.280]  Oh, yeah. Let us know what kind of soup Gavin was eating in the last video.
[01:30.760 --> 01:31.800]  It's Tommy soup.
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.020]  Well, anyway, it's not my place to question leadership decisions.
[01:36.520 --> 01:38.500]  He's bouncing a lot for having a knee brace.
[01:38.800 --> 01:39.720]  He's a meth guy, so...
[01:40.740 --> 01:43.820]  Hey, great point. You solved the case, Sherlock.
[01:43.980 --> 01:44.180]  Yep.
[01:44.280 --> 01:45.420]  I was really pondering.
[01:45.580 --> 01:48.020]  Look at his face. He's a meth guy.
[01:48.660 --> 01:49.980]  Good lord. Have you got enough bullets in you, Nick?
[01:50.020 --> 01:51.380]  Jesus Christ!
[01:51.380 --> 01:54.920]  I was a busy boy in between the videos.
[01:56.360 --> 01:57.560]  Don't let him kill him.
[01:57.600 --> 01:59.780]  I was trying to get a cat across the room.
[01:59.780 --> 02:01.540]  It was very funny for you to say, look at his face,
[02:01.580 --> 02:04.860]  and then it cut to all of us and our fucking nonsense faces.
[02:05.120 --> 02:05.220]  Yep.
[02:05.700 --> 02:07.040]  Okay, we got to do the cuts.
[02:08.120 --> 02:09.840]  Got to go to the warehouse. We got to get in position.
[02:09.940 --> 02:12.280]  We got to hold my position, and then we got to take out the enemy.
[02:14.620 --> 02:16.600]  This heist is worth less than the last one.
[02:19.960 --> 02:20.280]  What?
[02:20.280 --> 02:24.500]  Gavin hates how much money he makes or doesn't make from these things.
[02:24.620 --> 02:26.480]  It's so inconsequential to me. I don't even think...
[02:26.480 --> 02:27.880]  I don't own a car or a home.
[02:28.360 --> 02:31.960]  I don't know what the money does in this game other than buy me armor.
[02:32.560 --> 02:33.580]  You throw it at strippers.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.220]  Oh, that I've done. That I know all about.
[02:37.820 --> 02:38.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39.000 --> 02:39.340]  We good?
[02:39.600 --> 02:40.240]  Yeah, let's do it.
[02:40.360 --> 02:40.500]  Are you happy?
[02:42.500 --> 02:43.460]  We look like shit.
[02:44.500 --> 02:45.200]  Well, you do.
[02:45.920 --> 02:47.460]  We all look like shit.
[02:48.160 --> 02:48.940]  I look great.
[02:48.960 --> 02:49.420]  I look fantastic.
[02:49.420 --> 02:54.280]  For the next in-person regulation recording, Eric, do you want to cosplay Team Tape?
[02:55.160 --> 02:55.760]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:57.700 --> 02:58.520]  That would be...
[02:58.980 --> 02:59.640]  Yeah, we're Team Tape, baby.
[02:59.640 --> 03:00.120]  It's so painful.
[03:00.260 --> 03:01.780]  Geoff won't know what the fuck to do.
[03:02.940 --> 03:04.400]  He'll probably just not let you in.
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.760]  The attackers are closing in on their stolen drugs.
[03:10.900 --> 03:11.680]  Get to the warehouse.
[03:12.040 --> 03:12.060]  What?
[03:12.660 --> 03:12.880]  What?
[03:13.700 --> 03:14.520]  Oh, Gavin!
[03:15.120 --> 03:17.780]  Alright, so let's turn it over.
[03:20.120 --> 03:21.180]  He's still alive.
[03:22.040 --> 03:23.260]  Hey, are we playing on normal?
[03:24.600 --> 03:25.080]  Nope.
[03:27.860 --> 03:30.340]  I got knocked into next week's video.
[03:30.740 --> 03:33.360]  Yeah, I saw you smash into my hood.
[03:34.060 --> 03:37.000]  Oh yeah, did you see him get run over by me afterwards?
[03:38.180 --> 03:39.280]  Did you not die?
[03:41.460 --> 03:42.700]  I walked it off.
[03:44.220 --> 03:45.520]  It did take all of my armor.
[03:46.540 --> 03:51.880]  There was a couple of folks on mopeds, and they needed to be taught the rules of the road.
[03:53.740 --> 03:54.220]  Missed.
[03:54.560 --> 03:57.080]  What are these idiots doing?
[04:00.240 --> 04:01.280]  I'm gonna lamp you, son.
[04:07.360 --> 04:07.860]  Loop around.
[04:09.540 --> 04:10.140]  There's no shortcut.
[04:11.140 --> 04:11.800]  No, there's not.
[04:12.780 --> 04:13.460]  Get in position.
[04:13.580 --> 04:14.500]  Masks up.
[04:14.960 --> 04:15.380]  Taped up.
[04:16.380 --> 04:17.080]  Taped up.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.820]  Whatever side Andrew's on, let's get on the opposite.
[04:25.420 --> 04:26.220]  Okie dokie.
[04:26.320 --> 04:27.180]  Waiting for team to get in position.
[04:30.560 --> 04:31.820]  Are we just in the tunnel, or are we on the roof?
[04:31.960 --> 04:33.020]  Let's go far, yeah.
[04:33.300 --> 04:34.240]  Nick, me and you, let's go far.
[04:34.500 --> 04:34.900]  Gavin's dead.
[04:34.900 --> 04:35.260]  Gavin died.
[04:40.200 --> 04:41.860]  What the fuck happened?
[04:42.800 --> 04:43.220]  What happened?
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.060]  He jumped off the bridge and missed, and just hit the pavement.
[04:47.060 --> 04:49.060]  The roof wasn't in the same spot that I thought it was.
[04:52.840 --> 04:54.160]  At least we're all grouped up.
[04:54.240 --> 04:56.460]  And that's a fancy minigun you got there.
[04:57.600 --> 04:58.240]  That's expensive.
[04:58.560 --> 04:59.080]  Who the fuck is this?
[04:59.220 --> 04:59.680]  Oh, it's Trevor.
[05:00.120 --> 05:02.120]  I was about to blow him away.
[05:02.920 --> 05:03.920]  Gavin, me and you on the top.
[05:04.620 --> 05:05.380]  You're about to blow him?
[05:05.460 --> 05:06.260]  I guess on the south.
[05:11.640 --> 05:13.640]  Where are we supposed to... oh, hop in, I guess?
[05:13.820 --> 05:14.980]  Oh, I liked it a lot more.
[05:15.620 --> 05:18.560]  Are we supposed to be up at the top?
[05:19.340 --> 05:20.500]  No, I don't think so.
[05:20.740 --> 05:22.600]  No, you're right.
[05:23.120 --> 05:24.000]  I'm with you, Gavin.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.360]  The R is down, though.
[05:26.100 --> 05:26.760]  What? Is it?
[05:27.220 --> 05:29.480]  We're supposed to be defending the vehicles in the tunnel.
[05:30.020 --> 05:30.560]  Oh, it is down.
[05:32.180 --> 05:34.000]  Gavin did it again, and I watched him.
[05:35.180 --> 05:35.940]  What, off the roof?
[05:36.380 --> 05:36.620]  Yeah.
[05:38.060 --> 05:40.860]  I don't know. It says get in position, but I don't know what the position is.
[05:41.200 --> 05:42.120]  I guess just over here?
[05:42.340 --> 05:43.000]  Come to us.
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.440]  Oh, there it is. Okay, cool.
[05:45.340 --> 05:46.980]  They're defending that end, we defend this end.
[05:52.430 --> 05:52.970]  Armor up.
[05:53.050 --> 05:53.610]  Trevor, shut up.
[05:54.370 --> 05:54.770]  Oh, yeah.
[05:54.870 --> 05:55.550]  Look at the enemies.
[05:56.190 --> 05:57.810]  Guys are coming from your side, it looks like.
[05:58.270 --> 05:58.910]  Looks like.
[06:00.070 --> 06:01.550]  I'm just going to stand right in the middle.
[06:02.370 --> 06:04.030]  I mean, you should probably get to cover, I think.
[06:04.650 --> 06:05.790]  I don't think I'll need to.
[06:06.990 --> 06:07.350]  Okay.
[06:09.890 --> 06:10.550]  Nice, Nick.
[06:10.650 --> 06:10.930]  Thank you.
[06:11.350 --> 06:12.210]  How's it going over there?
[06:13.350 --> 06:14.670]  It's making it real easy.
[06:15.310 --> 06:16.570]  I'm about to spend some money on some ammo.
[06:17.530 --> 06:19.310]  Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing.
[06:20.970 --> 06:21.650]  Here they come.
[06:24.950 --> 06:26.550]  Sorry, Andrew, I won't do that this time.
[06:27.270 --> 06:29.590]  No, feel free to. Do it as much as you want.
[06:29.710 --> 06:30.150]  That was easy.
[06:30.350 --> 06:30.830]  Guy over here?
[06:31.730 --> 06:32.630]  Oh, you got him, you got him.
[06:35.710 --> 06:36.330]  Okay, cool.
[06:37.850 --> 06:39.230]  Oh, we got some rando, folks.
[06:39.250 --> 06:40.470]  Okay, we got people on feet.
[06:40.930 --> 06:41.510]  On feet?
[06:41.790 --> 06:42.710]  People on feet.
[06:42.950 --> 06:43.390]  Oh, no.
[06:43.450 --> 06:44.110]  People on feet.
[06:44.350 --> 06:45.410]  Yep, they got the feet on.
[06:47.390 --> 06:48.970]  They're ready to deliver the trash.
[06:51.550 --> 06:52.350]  Oh, shit.
[06:52.710 --> 06:53.310]  That worked.
[06:53.670 --> 06:54.790]  Oh, shit, shit.
[06:54.950 --> 06:55.290]  Take cover.
[07:00.920 --> 07:03.280]  Thanks for covering me, because I was going to die.
[07:04.320 --> 07:04.560]  Oh.
[07:04.620 --> 07:05.000]  We're all good.
[07:06.060 --> 07:06.380]  Right.
[07:06.560 --> 07:07.340]  Are they right on top of it?
[07:07.400 --> 07:07.800]  There they are.
[07:09.060 --> 07:09.380]  Great.
[07:09.540 --> 07:10.640]  You get the left, I'll get the right.
[07:12.060 --> 07:13.220]  Okay, we'll cover each other.
[07:14.660 --> 07:18.120]  I'm going to pivot to them if you want to focus on them.
[07:18.120 --> 07:18.320]  Come on.
[07:18.420 --> 07:18.800]  There he is.
[07:20.180 --> 07:20.820]  Nice shot.
[07:21.500 --> 07:21.900]  Got him.
[07:21.960 --> 07:22.020]  Thank you.
[07:22.100 --> 07:23.100]  Guy on the right, guy on the right.
[07:23.100 --> 07:23.860]  I got him.
[07:25.200 --> 07:26.020]  Oh, you got him.
[07:26.120 --> 07:26.460]  Good work.
[07:27.860 --> 07:28.080]  Nice.
[07:28.840 --> 07:30.140]  Okay, each van needs one driver.
[07:30.320 --> 07:30.760]  Prepare to move out.
[07:35.660 --> 07:37.180]  Anybody getting in the gun with me?
[07:39.120 --> 07:40.320]  That's up to you guys.
[07:40.380 --> 07:41.460]  I got this thing.
[07:41.740 --> 07:42.460]  Big time.
[07:43.160 --> 07:44.160]  All right, let's do it, boys.
[07:46.320 --> 07:47.980]  All right, we're on the move.
[07:49.060 --> 07:49.980]  Where the hell are we supposed to...
[07:49.980 --> 07:50.200]  Oh.
[07:50.260 --> 07:51.360]  Where are we going, Andrew?
[07:51.480 --> 07:51.780]  Go up.
[07:52.620 --> 07:53.240]  Go this way.
[07:53.420 --> 07:53.960]  I don't have...
[07:53.960 --> 07:54.460]  Oh, this one.
[07:54.500 --> 07:54.660]  Okay.
[07:55.020 --> 07:58.680]  I think we can make the jump over to the freeway from here.
[08:00.460 --> 08:01.740]  You think these things can?
[08:02.200 --> 08:02.380]  Yeah.
[08:03.500 --> 08:03.900]  Big time.
[08:06.040 --> 08:06.520]  Let's see.
[08:07.900 --> 08:08.660]  Oh, nice.
[08:08.780 --> 08:09.080]  I did.
[08:09.160 --> 08:09.580]  Nice and cool.
[08:09.860 --> 08:10.940]  Yeah, that evens out pretty easily.
[08:10.940 --> 08:12.340]  You have to keep giving it gas, buddy.
[08:12.800 --> 08:13.080]  I know.
[08:13.120 --> 08:14.960]  I was watching to make sure Andrew made it before we kept going.
[08:15.460 --> 08:15.600]  Okay.
[08:15.700 --> 08:17.160]  There's a helicopter top left.
[08:18.100 --> 08:19.180]  Oh, right above us.
[08:24.080 --> 08:25.160]  I missed my minigun.
[08:25.260 --> 08:27.140]  Yeah, there are helicopters all over the place.
[08:27.300 --> 08:27.540]  Nice.
[08:27.640 --> 08:27.720]  Nice.
[08:27.760 --> 08:28.440]  Good shot.
[08:29.700 --> 08:30.140]  You see him?
[08:30.260 --> 08:31.420]  Do you want me to slow down?
[08:31.520 --> 08:31.600]  No.
[08:32.460 --> 08:33.280]  Oh, it's good.
[08:33.580 --> 08:34.860]  They're shooting you guys mainly.
[08:35.020 --> 08:35.260]  I haven't been hit.
[08:35.260 --> 08:36.020]  Well, that guy's coming low.
[08:36.800 --> 08:37.520]  Oh, wow.
[08:38.060 --> 08:38.740]  Holy shit.
[08:39.020 --> 08:39.780]  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
[08:40.080 --> 08:41.660]  Did you do that or did you just crash?
[08:41.660 --> 08:41.980]  No, I did it.
[08:42.020 --> 08:42.400]  No, he died.
[08:43.060 --> 08:43.380]  Okay.
[08:43.740 --> 08:44.040]  Nice.
[08:44.420 --> 08:45.120]  Okay, Gavin, we're back up.
[08:48.200 --> 08:49.440]  I'm trying not to hit you.
[08:49.480 --> 08:49.660]  Sorry.
[08:50.100 --> 08:50.780]  Oh, shit.
[08:51.760 --> 08:52.240]  I'm moving.
[08:52.360 --> 08:52.900]  I'm still going.
[08:53.260 --> 08:54.080]  Yeah, me too.
[08:54.200 --> 08:55.480]  I got my snack screen up.
[08:58.720 --> 08:59.080]  Oh.
[09:00.060 --> 09:00.780]  Holy shit.
[09:00.880 --> 09:01.680]  That guy almost hit a tree.
[09:02.340 --> 09:03.040]  He sure did.
[09:03.320 --> 09:04.100]  He might hit the...
[09:04.100 --> 09:04.760]  Nice shooting.
[09:05.900 --> 09:11.620]  Oh, shit.
[09:11.680 --> 09:13.060]  There's a bunch of guys up here.
[09:13.900 --> 09:14.600]  Oh, man.
[09:14.920 --> 09:14.960]  Oh, boy.
[09:15.360 --> 09:15.900]  A bunch of limes.
[09:16.000 --> 09:16.780]  I see the lime.
[09:17.000 --> 09:17.640]  Oh, a bunch.
[09:17.840 --> 09:18.580]  Oh, so many.
[09:19.060 --> 09:19.580]  So, so many.
[09:19.680 --> 09:20.300]  Oh, limes.
[09:20.740 --> 09:21.260]  Get out of there, Nick.
[09:21.320 --> 09:21.620]  Oh, it's lime time.
[09:21.820 --> 09:22.360]  Thanks, Nick.
[09:22.360 --> 09:22.920]  Good call out.
[09:25.220 --> 09:25.800]  Almost there.
[09:25.880 --> 09:26.300]  Almost there.
[09:26.500 --> 09:27.400]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[09:29.860 --> 09:31.540]  Oh, nice job, Andrew.
[09:31.660 --> 09:32.200]  Way to...
[09:32.200 --> 09:32.780]  Thank you.
[09:32.880 --> 09:33.140]  Sorry.
[09:33.500 --> 09:34.080]  Giving you space.
[09:34.400 --> 09:36.800]  Oh, Eric, are there any ahead of you or should we hold back?
[09:36.820 --> 09:38.200]  Not yet, but there's going to be.
[09:38.620 --> 09:38.840]  Okay.
[09:45.440 --> 09:46.620]  Still doing good for health.
[09:47.480 --> 09:48.220]  Yeah, I'm about...
[09:48.220 --> 09:48.420]  Oh.
[09:48.560 --> 09:49.300]  We're both at about...
[09:49.300 --> 09:49.820]  What?
[09:50.380 --> 09:51.160]  Losing a sixth?
[09:51.880 --> 09:52.900]  No, like a semi.
[09:52.900 --> 09:53.900]  You don't have to shoot that car.
[09:54.120 --> 09:54.280]  Okay.
[09:54.280 --> 09:55.000]  That's fine.
[09:55.080 --> 09:55.560]  You got it.
[09:55.660 --> 09:56.140]  Get out of the way.
[09:56.640 --> 09:57.540]  It's going to blow up.
[09:57.620 --> 09:58.540]  It's going to hurt us.
[09:58.980 --> 10:00.400]  No, this is...
[10:01.260 --> 10:02.220]  No, this is beneficial.
[10:02.640 --> 10:03.240]  We had to be sure.
[10:04.020 --> 10:04.240]  Oh, yeah.
[10:04.360 --> 10:04.660]  Don't...
[10:04.660 --> 10:05.700]  Certainly don't shoot me.
[10:05.820 --> 10:07.640]  You're in the way of the...
[10:07.640 --> 10:09.940]  Oh, we got motorcycle, guys.
[10:10.080 --> 10:10.540]  Oh, shit.
[10:11.040 --> 10:11.520]  Oh, boy.
[10:11.620 --> 10:12.320]  That was awesome.
[10:12.880 --> 10:13.140]  Between us.
[10:14.720 --> 10:15.280]  Oh, wow.
[10:15.420 --> 10:16.020]  Lime vehicle.
[10:16.100 --> 10:17.060]  Oh, I took so much health.
[10:17.120 --> 10:17.620]  Oh, my God.
[10:18.720 --> 10:19.260]  Put that on.
[10:20.640 --> 10:21.280]  Catch up, Nick.
[10:22.100 --> 10:22.360]  Yep.
[10:22.360 --> 10:22.980]  Yep.
[10:23.340 --> 10:24.440]  Got guys in front now.
[10:25.280 --> 10:26.040]  Yep, sorry.
[10:26.400 --> 10:27.540]  Motorcycle guys in front.
[10:27.780 --> 10:28.480]  We're coming.
[10:28.640 --> 10:29.500]  It's a slow truck.
[10:31.160 --> 10:31.920]  Somehow slower than yours.
[10:31.920 --> 10:33.280]  I'll take them out with my own gun, I guess.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.880]  How many times do I have to say, slow truck?
[10:39.880 --> 10:43.120]  I'm eating as many snacks as I can, boys.
[10:43.140 --> 10:43.820]  You guys get up.
[10:44.360 --> 10:45.240]  Oh, guys.
[10:45.780 --> 10:46.220]  Oh.
[10:46.500 --> 10:47.200]  Oh, guys.
[10:47.240 --> 10:48.140]  This is not good.
[10:48.600 --> 10:49.480]  Oh, guys.
[10:50.120 --> 10:50.900]  Gavin, get up.
[10:51.460 --> 10:52.800]  Oh, this isn't good, boys.
[10:52.980 --> 10:53.580]  Go, go, go.
[10:53.580 --> 10:54.460]  Swerve, Eric.
[10:55.380 --> 10:56.260]  Oh, my God.
[10:56.780 --> 10:56.800]  Oh, guys.
[10:57.900 --> 10:58.700]  Not good.
[10:59.060 --> 11:00.060]  Yeah, it's not good.
[11:00.240 --> 11:00.960]  Gavin fell out.
[11:01.100 --> 11:02.060]  Maybe stop driving.
[11:02.500 --> 11:03.600]  It's terrible up there.
[11:03.780 --> 11:04.580]  Like, brake.
[11:04.720 --> 11:05.100]  Oh, no.
[11:05.200 --> 11:05.900]  I got rid of him.
[11:06.200 --> 11:07.880]  It just wasn't good the whole time.
[11:08.360 --> 11:08.900]  Got it.
[11:09.040 --> 11:09.640]  Is it better now?
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.160]  Yeah, how's it going?
[11:11.380 --> 11:12.060]  Oh, shit.
[11:14.480 --> 11:17.060]  I was sliding across the road on my face for a little bit there.
[11:17.700 --> 11:18.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:18.560 --> 11:20.800]  I was trying to help Gavin get back up.
[11:20.940 --> 11:21.140]  Good job, Eric.
[11:21.580 --> 11:21.900]  Oh, nice.
[11:22.680 --> 11:23.940]  Almost there, man.
[11:25.700 --> 11:26.400]  We're almost there.
[11:28.760 --> 11:29.380]  What the fuck?
[11:29.400 --> 11:30.600]  That car just turned around in front of me.
[11:30.680 --> 11:33.420]  That car just turned around in front of me for no reason.
[11:34.280 --> 11:35.440]  That wasn't even a bad guy.
[11:35.500 --> 11:36.320]  That was just a guy.
[11:36.580 --> 11:37.540]  Oh, we're finally catching up.
[11:38.240 --> 11:38.380]  Yep.
[11:38.820 --> 11:39.260]  Oh, great.
[11:39.400 --> 11:39.640]  Just in time.
[11:41.160 --> 11:41.780]  No, we're still there.
[11:42.480 --> 11:46.020]  Wow, you guys are ragging on us.
[11:46.020 --> 11:47.840]  I'm down to about half.
[11:47.940 --> 11:48.680]  I got half health.
[11:48.820 --> 11:50.900]  Yeah, you got chomped on that.
[11:50.900 --> 11:51.160]  Yeah.
[11:51.820 --> 11:53.020]  It was me against the world.
[11:53.360 --> 11:53.880]  Hey, we got it.
[11:53.920 --> 11:56.040]  There's a left turn here, Andrew, and it's like this bridge.
[11:56.060 --> 11:56.960]  You just gotta take it.
[11:57.000 --> 11:57.540]  I'm right behind you.
[11:57.560 --> 11:57.840]  Nice and easy.
[11:58.840 --> 11:59.540]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[12:00.560 --> 12:01.180]  Here we go.
[12:09.140 --> 12:10.160]  I don't like this truck.
[12:10.260 --> 12:10.700]  It was the White House.
[12:10.840 --> 12:12.640]  I think we're locked in here.
[12:13.440 --> 12:14.540]  We're locked in, baby.
[12:15.460 --> 12:15.820]  Easy.
[12:18.180 --> 12:18.680]  Got it.
[12:19.720 --> 12:20.300]  Nailed it.
[12:22.640 --> 12:23.000]  Nice.
[12:26.780 --> 12:27.120]  Wow.
[12:33.740 --> 12:34.720]  That was it?
[12:36.020 --> 12:37.140]  That was easy.
[12:37.320 --> 12:37.540]  Wow.
[12:41.560 --> 12:42.860]  Oh, he stole those.
[12:45.040 --> 12:46.060]  It's our trash.
[13:00.320 --> 13:02.180]  They should let you voice your own character.
[13:02.900 --> 13:03.260]  Yeah.
[13:04.400 --> 13:06.280]  Let me say shit back to this guy.
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.440]  Before you load up online, you should have to do like 10 hours of VO.
[13:25.760 --> 13:26.880]  That's my kind of guy.
[13:32.200 --> 13:33.360]  I thought Phil had one arm.
[13:35.040 --> 13:36.660]  This guy is a cop?
[13:40.220 --> 13:43.120]  Yeah, isn't this the one where Trevor ends up crying in his underwear?
[13:44.760 --> 13:45.700]  Oh, it might be.
[13:51.860 --> 13:56.280]  He gives me the Russian from Armageddon vibes.
[13:56.500 --> 13:57.260]  Peter Stormare.
[13:57.640 --> 13:57.780]  Hell yeah.
[13:58.300 --> 13:58.960]  Oh, he does, yeah.
[14:07.800 --> 14:13.120]  I wonder what the most amount of money you can fit in a standard-sized briefcase is.
[14:13.240 --> 14:13.740]  Good question.
[14:15.300 --> 14:18.100]  In like normal cash, or are we talking bearer bonds?
[14:21.180 --> 14:22.520]  German bearer bonds.
[14:23.940 --> 14:27.120]  TBG watched the Beverly Hills Cop movies.
[14:27.760 --> 14:31.940]  I need to ask him to give Eric his ratings of the action.
[14:46.700 --> 14:48.180]  I knew this guy was a fucking cop.
[14:53.160 --> 14:54.860]  Good thing Trevor paid us first.
[15:05.960 --> 15:08.220]  And off he goes to the main game.
[15:14.500 --> 15:15.240]  Heist Fest!
[15:15.900 --> 15:16.440]  Platinum!
[15:17.820 --> 15:18.360]  Achievement!
[15:19.200 --> 15:20.340]  In the name of science!
[15:21.160 --> 15:22.740]  You completed the main labs raid.
[15:23.360 --> 15:24.900]  Actual take is good, cool.
[15:25.900 --> 15:28.090]  Okay, so I got 22k, but...
[15:29.060 --> 15:29.700]  Did not...
[15:31.640 --> 15:32.940]  First time bonus, 32.
[15:33.100 --> 15:33.580]  Hell yeah.
[15:35.360 --> 15:36.680]  320, baby!
[15:37.660 --> 15:38.540]  $32,000!
[15:39.160 --> 15:40.960]  Oh, 15 job points.
[15:42.620 --> 15:44.300]  Dude, I got so many JPs, dude.
[15:44.540 --> 15:46.820]  When am I gonna be able to spend my JPs?
[15:47.580 --> 15:48.180]  Oh, you're not.
[15:48.720 --> 15:50.280]  Well, when does GTA 6 come out?
[15:50.400 --> 15:50.820]  Probably then.
[15:54.620 --> 15:55.780]  You're right, he's crying.
[15:57.260 --> 15:58.400]  Yeah, but he's not in his undies.
[15:58.480 --> 15:59.980]  I must have imagined the undies thing.
[15:59.980 --> 16:00.640]  He killed Gavin.
[16:02.180 --> 16:03.840]  Is it from the main game, this part?
[16:04.020 --> 16:05.000]  Yeah, I think...
[16:05.000 --> 16:05.300]  Nah.
[16:05.400 --> 16:06.160]  No, not this part.
[16:07.420 --> 16:08.260]  Series of funding.
[16:11.620 --> 16:13.200]  So do we have to do another pod?
[16:13.240 --> 16:14.320]  Because that's not long enough for a vid.
[16:15.020 --> 16:15.720]  No, hell no.
[16:16.040 --> 16:20.400]  We either have to attach that to another video, or...
[16:20.400 --> 16:20.840]  Why don't we do a...
[16:20.840 --> 16:22.000]  We have to do something for Lester.
[16:22.320 --> 16:22.480]  No.
[16:22.620 --> 16:23.060]  You know what?
[16:23.260 --> 16:24.200]  Between the Heists!
[16:24.420 --> 16:28.180]  Let's do a gang attack thing and see if Lester calls.
[16:28.180 --> 16:30.360]  Guys, welcome to Between the Heists!
[16:31.160 --> 16:33.380]  Thank you so much for joining us on Between the Heists.
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.720]  Between the Heists, After the Heists, During the Heists.
[16:37.780 --> 16:39.180]  Where's the next gang raid?
[16:40.340 --> 16:41.760]  Hang on, let me see if I see one.
[16:41.960 --> 16:42.400]  Gang what?
[16:43.560 --> 16:44.560]  The gang attack!
[16:44.740 --> 16:45.900]  Whatever those things are.
[16:47.180 --> 16:47.540]  Let's see.
[16:49.200 --> 16:51.960]  I can load up another bounty hunt if we want to do one of those.
[16:52.720 --> 16:53.500]  Whatever you want to do, dude.
[16:53.860 --> 16:54.280]  Yeah, man.
[16:54.380 --> 16:55.000]  Let's do that.
[16:55.220 --> 16:55.640]  Let's get money.
[16:56.640 --> 16:57.400]  Oh, Lester called.
[16:57.400 --> 16:58.200]  Did he really?
[16:59.040 --> 16:59.880]  You piece of shit.
[16:59.980 --> 17:00.320]  Yeah, he did.
[17:00.740 --> 17:04.100]  Are we starting the next heist now?
[17:04.140 --> 17:06.640]  Are we rolling into the next heist in this heist?
[17:06.700 --> 17:06.920]  Yeah!
[17:07.400 --> 17:08.560]  Holy shit, that rocks.
[17:09.140 --> 17:09.560]  Wow!
[17:09.960 --> 17:11.800]  Uh, he called to say he'll call me later.
[17:11.880 --> 17:12.040]  You bitch!
[17:12.040 --> 17:13.060]  Oh, son of a bitch!
[17:13.840 --> 17:14.080]  Huh.
[17:15.040 --> 17:15.260]  Huh.
[17:15.740 --> 17:17.300]  He said, hey, good job on doing that heist.
[17:18.040 --> 17:18.540]  Call you later.
[17:19.300 --> 17:20.700]  Contact Maud Eccles.
[17:22.000 --> 17:22.420]  Who?
[17:23.360 --> 17:23.980]  Who's he?
[17:25.540 --> 17:26.620]  I want the achievement.
[17:28.820 --> 17:30.480]  I'm going to do a bounty hunt.
[17:30.500 --> 17:31.500]  Yeah, I'll come with you.
[17:32.600 --> 17:32.920]  What?
[17:33.140 --> 17:33.960]  There's one right there?
[17:34.040 --> 17:34.460]  No, there's not.
[17:34.720 --> 17:35.720]  I'm doing a proper bounty.
[17:38.340 --> 17:40.040]  We can do another one of those missions real quick.
[17:41.180 --> 17:43.100]  You can knock me off the truck a million times.
[17:43.200 --> 17:43.620]  It'll be great.
[17:46.360 --> 17:49.140]  Between the heist and the heist video.
[17:51.220 --> 17:52.180]  It is in the heist video.
[17:52.200 --> 17:52.620]  It's pretty good.
[17:53.060 --> 17:53.380]  Yeah.
[17:53.440 --> 17:53.740]  It is.
[17:53.880 --> 17:54.060]  Yeah.
[17:54.920 --> 17:57.320]  It's double the content in one video.
[17:57.560 --> 17:57.600]  Yeah.
[17:59.220 --> 18:02.920]  You know how you can buy those DVDs where it's like four DVDs in one box?
[18:03.080 --> 18:03.840]  It's like that.
[18:04.020 --> 18:05.920]  But all four play simultaneously.
[18:06.360 --> 18:09.240]  Call now and you'll get a second one for free.
[18:12.340 --> 18:13.280]  How do I buy a house?
[18:13.360 --> 18:15.740]  Do I have to go to a place and say, hey, I want this thing?
[18:15.800 --> 18:17.320]  Or do I have to go online?
[18:18.020 --> 18:19.040]  I think you can do it online.
[18:19.260 --> 18:19.740]  In your phone.
[18:20.180 --> 18:20.780]  Do it on my phone?
[18:21.240 --> 18:23.200]  Is it the Dynasty 8 executive thing?
[18:23.200 --> 18:23.760]  I think so.
[18:23.860 --> 18:24.060]  Yeah.
[18:36.520 --> 18:39.700]  Driving a car to the debt office.
[18:40.920 --> 18:42.960]  To the debt office?
[18:43.740 --> 18:46.060]  Taking them to the debt place.
[18:46.260 --> 18:47.180]  Are you going all the way to the top of the map?
[18:47.520 --> 18:48.140]  Deliver the debt.
[18:48.300 --> 18:49.240]  Already there.
[18:49.400 --> 18:49.660]  Already there.
[18:50.520 --> 18:54.680]  Already going to initiate a new mission.
[19:00.910 --> 19:01.830]  Pop a hydrant.
[19:04.890 --> 19:06.530]  Summer activities, baby.
[19:12.050 --> 19:15.030]  Great time to fill up on snacks.
[19:15.150 --> 19:16.230]  If you need any snacks.
[19:16.990 --> 19:21.650]  Oh, this is the pink unicorn bail office.
[19:23.390 --> 19:24.450]  That sounds right.
[19:27.690 --> 19:29.010]  Sit down.
[19:29.150 --> 19:32.210]  Let's see who we got to arrest today for big money.
[19:35.590 --> 19:36.390]  Big money.
[19:43.570 --> 19:49.290]  I click the wrong person and then I say, no, I don't want to do this one.
[19:49.370 --> 19:52.310]  And it's like, you got to wait for her to explain the target anyway.
[19:54.790 --> 19:55.630]  Where you going, man?
[19:56.470 --> 19:57.930]  We're going for Leroy O'Neal.
[19:59.810 --> 20:00.350]  You say so.
[20:05.210 --> 20:08.290]  He's got a real weird stank about him.
[20:15.190 --> 20:16.030]  Here we go.
[20:17.130 --> 20:18.010]  Our target's an O'Neal.
[20:18.110 --> 20:18.730]  Surprise, surprise.
[20:18.830 --> 20:20.190]  A little old Leroy here.
[20:20.270 --> 20:22.330]  He's got a whole lot of charges and a whole lot of bail bonds to his...
[20:22.330 --> 20:23.390]  Hey, it's the bonds, Gavin.
[20:24.210 --> 20:24.550]  Bonds.
[20:26.790 --> 20:27.470]  Bail bonds.
[20:28.410 --> 20:29.090]  Bail bonds.
[20:33.790 --> 20:35.550]  Banning, banning, banning.
[20:36.210 --> 20:39.090]  You think this guy will have that armored suit?
[20:40.470 --> 20:40.910]  No.
[20:41.710 --> 20:42.350]  He better not.
[20:44.970 --> 20:47.630]  If he has that armored suit, I'll be so mad about it.
[20:48.610 --> 20:49.490]  Oh, man.
[20:49.810 --> 20:50.830]  I'll be so annoyed.
[20:51.010 --> 20:53.270]  I wonder if I'll be playing by the end of this.
[20:54.890 --> 20:55.810]  We're almost there.
[20:55.910 --> 20:56.570]  Hey, we're doing it.
[20:56.890 --> 20:57.050]  Oh, fuck.
[20:57.350 --> 20:58.390]  Uh-oh, there it is.
[20:59.230 --> 21:00.510]  I'm not getting in that fucking thing.
[21:00.750 --> 21:01.630]  Walk out of here with that.
[21:04.790 --> 21:05.150]  Yeah.
[21:05.950 --> 21:07.430]  No, we got to ride on the sides.
[21:08.230 --> 21:08.830]  Yeah, what are you doing?
[21:09.030 --> 21:09.290]  He's right.
[21:09.410 --> 21:09.970]  Come on, Andrew.
[21:10.050 --> 21:10.470]  He's right.
[21:11.230 --> 21:11.590]  Okay.
[21:12.830 --> 21:14.650]  We got to go to the abandoned motel.
[21:16.350 --> 21:17.470]  Right on the side.
[21:19.150 --> 21:20.070]  I've never driven this.
[21:20.130 --> 21:20.830]  Hey, it's not that far.
[21:21.030 --> 21:21.610]  It's pretty close.
[21:22.430 --> 21:23.190]  All things considered.
[21:28.590 --> 21:29.370]  Hey, me again.
[21:29.410 --> 21:30.550]  You guys are wanted for murder?
[21:31.630 --> 21:31.990]  No.
[21:31.990 --> 21:32.010]  No.
[21:34.870 --> 21:36.650]  I thought she was about to call it off, though.
[21:37.030 --> 21:37.990]  Oh, Gavin!
[21:38.990 --> 21:39.410]  Shit.
[21:41.590 --> 21:42.730]  Oh, it's Gavin on the sides.
[21:42.990 --> 21:43.250]  There we go.
[21:43.690 --> 21:45.090]  Gavin, did you ask if that guy was okay?
[21:46.010 --> 21:46.530]  He alright.
[21:49.010 --> 21:50.110]  He's not getting up.
[21:51.030 --> 21:51.330]  Good.
[21:54.010 --> 21:56.430]  Dude, the CEO proximity bonus rocks.
[21:58.230 --> 22:00.090]  I just keep getting 200 RP.
[22:00.370 --> 22:01.110]  Like, fucking crazy.
[22:02.390 --> 22:03.990]  Just like, oh, you're close to this guy.
[22:04.170 --> 22:05.910]  There's a bunch of XP, dude.
[22:06.090 --> 22:06.770]  Go crazy mode.
[22:06.950 --> 22:08.930]  That's how it works in the mind of CEOs.
[22:09.430 --> 22:10.250]  Holy shit!
[22:11.610 --> 22:14.870]  Gavin is making this hard, but I like it.
[22:15.030 --> 22:16.070]  I'm warning people off us.
[22:16.850 --> 22:17.850]  If you get any ideas.
[22:19.310 --> 22:25.720]  In the mind of CEOs.
[22:27.860 --> 22:29.080]  You're near me.
[22:29.600 --> 22:30.220]  Leveling up.
[22:31.140 --> 22:31.580]  Absolutely.
[22:31.660 --> 22:32.180]  Who threw a grenade?
[22:32.700 --> 22:33.700]  That's the CEO mindset.
[22:34.060 --> 22:34.220]  What?
[22:34.580 --> 22:35.140]  Oh my god.
[22:35.140 --> 22:36.540]  Are you seeing how long you can cook?
[22:39.800 --> 22:41.180]  One, two, three.
[22:41.260 --> 22:41.480]  Oh!
[22:42.660 --> 22:44.020]  Oh, you can cook longer than that.
[22:44.540 --> 22:45.280]  Oh yeah, way longer.
[22:45.480 --> 22:45.720]  Let's see.
[22:45.880 --> 22:48.560]  One, two, three.
[22:51.440 --> 22:53.060]  Yeah, you can cook even longer than that.
[22:53.740 --> 22:53.900]  Yeah.
[22:54.080 --> 22:54.400]  No!
[22:55.060 --> 22:55.500]  No!
[22:56.360 --> 22:57.240]  One, three.
[22:57.380 --> 22:57.680]  No!
[22:58.060 --> 22:58.640]  Shut up!
[22:58.940 --> 22:59.540]  Shut up!
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.720]  It's got to explode within a second if you throw it.
[23:05.540 --> 23:05.980]  No!
[23:05.980 --> 23:09.200]  One, two, three, four, five.
[23:09.380 --> 23:10.200]  Stop it!
[23:11.180 --> 23:12.440]  Oh, that was close.
[23:16.680 --> 23:18.420]  Dude, let's get in that boat.
[23:23.990 --> 23:24.790]  Oh man.
[23:25.070 --> 23:29.470]  I was trying to figure out how much money I had and then realized that Gavin was whispering into Nick's ear.
[23:30.450 --> 23:31.250]  Oh, right.
[23:31.710 --> 23:33.190]  I got snapped back into the panic.
[23:33.350 --> 23:33.450]  Yeah.
[23:33.690 --> 23:33.730]  No!
[23:34.990 --> 23:37.710]  It really is just exactly what it is.
[23:37.850 --> 23:38.590]  It's just that.
[23:38.590 --> 23:40.010]  It's a siren song to him.
[23:40.570 --> 23:40.950]  Oh.
[23:41.830 --> 23:43.290]  That beach sure looks nice.
[23:43.890 --> 23:47.290]  We've played so much of this game, I'm not going to be able to see my wife before she goes to work.
[23:54.430 --> 23:55.470]  Damn, I keep missing.
[23:55.910 --> 23:58.510]  How's the podcast doing?
[23:59.990 --> 24:01.210]  The podcast is doing great.
[24:01.330 --> 24:08.850]  She read your gross little story and you can see your face all over her video where you're just hiding your face.
[24:08.990 --> 24:10.890]  I felt so ill after that recording.
[24:11.090 --> 24:11.930]  I got heartburn.
[24:14.190 --> 24:15.410]  It was that hot, huh?
[24:16.630 --> 24:19.010]  I just felt like shit afterwards for like two hours.
[24:19.590 --> 24:19.950]  Ah!
[24:20.310 --> 24:20.970]  Oh, shit.
[24:22.230 --> 24:23.230]  That car just came out of nowhere.
[24:23.250 --> 24:24.530]  I thought that, yeah.
[24:25.290 --> 24:27.110]  I thought that bumper was Gavin from it.
[24:27.210 --> 24:27.930]  I thought he went flying.
[24:28.610 --> 24:29.470]  Thank you for punishing them.
[24:29.990 --> 24:30.470]  You're welcome.
[24:30.890 --> 24:31.610]  Oh, Gavin got him.
[24:31.710 --> 24:31.850]  Sorry.
[24:31.950 --> 24:32.790]  Oh, we're by Sandy Shoals.
[24:32.850 --> 24:33.570]  Go to the runway.
[24:33.690 --> 24:34.150]  Let's get a plane.
[24:34.990 --> 24:35.170]  Okay.
[24:35.370 --> 24:35.810]  Take a left.
[24:36.830 --> 24:37.490]  What's the point?
[24:37.790 --> 24:38.390]  We're here.
[24:38.930 --> 24:39.510]  We're at the location.
[24:39.530 --> 24:39.990]  Oh, right.
[24:39.990 --> 24:41.830]  You can take off with the plane to take him home.
[24:42.250 --> 24:45.170]  Yeah, we'll take him to a plane.
[24:52.950 --> 24:54.430]  Well, this is where we're going, right?
[24:54.910 --> 24:55.910]  Yeah, to the dock.
[24:56.590 --> 24:57.590]  Search the motel.
[24:57.790 --> 24:58.510]  Okay, let's find him.
[24:59.750 --> 25:00.330]  Alright, boys.
[25:00.330 --> 25:00.930]  Everybody out.
[25:03.730 --> 25:04.370]  Let's get him.
[25:04.510 --> 25:06.350]  Yeah, rat mode, rat mode, rat mode, rat mode.
[25:07.130 --> 25:07.830]  Oh, cat.
[25:08.450 --> 25:09.430]  That's the cat I was chasing.
[25:09.470 --> 25:10.430]  I was over here chasing the cat.
[25:10.490 --> 25:11.030]  That's my cat.
[25:11.030 --> 25:11.410]  Oh.
[25:11.870 --> 25:12.150]  Yeah.
[25:12.990 --> 25:13.230]  See?
[25:14.050 --> 25:16.470]  If anything bad happens to the cat, we kill the guy.
[25:17.190 --> 25:18.090]  The cat lives.
[25:18.570 --> 25:19.330]  The cat lives.
[25:19.510 --> 25:19.810]  I don't see him.
[25:19.990 --> 25:20.390]  He dies.
[25:20.510 --> 25:20.650]  Oh, wait.
[25:20.990 --> 25:21.730]  The rat found him!
[25:22.770 --> 25:23.870]  Oh, I'm getting a text.
[25:24.510 --> 25:24.990]  Oh, shit!
[25:25.890 --> 25:26.470]  Back to my head.
[25:26.490 --> 25:27.850]  Oh, we all see our own characters.
[25:27.850 --> 25:29.110]  Yeah, we all see our own guy getting knocked out.
[25:29.390 --> 25:29.750]  I could've...
[25:29.750 --> 25:29.950]  Yeah.
[25:29.950 --> 25:31.430]  I could've stand and see Gavin getting knocked out.
[25:31.450 --> 25:31.730]  It's fine.
[25:32.290 --> 25:32.570]  Yeah.
[25:32.870 --> 25:33.350]  Or the rat.
[25:33.850 --> 25:34.270]  Uh-oh.
[25:35.050 --> 25:35.810]  Oh, shit.
[25:35.890 --> 25:36.990]  Oh, this is some Red Dead Redemption shit.
[25:36.990 --> 25:37.570]  I've been kidnapped?
[25:38.910 --> 25:39.250]  No!
[25:39.950 --> 25:41.650]  Are we in four different rooms?
[25:42.350 --> 25:43.090]  No, we're all here.
[25:43.090 --> 25:43.690]  No, we're all together.
[25:44.050 --> 25:45.930]  Oh, guys, this is just like an escape room.
[25:46.070 --> 25:46.510]  This is full of it.
[25:46.510 --> 25:47.670]  I don't know my mask.
[25:48.230 --> 25:48.810]  Oh, man.
[25:49.030 --> 25:49.230]  What the fuck?
[25:49.270 --> 25:50.030]  My mask is gone.
[25:50.430 --> 25:51.130]  Where's all my shit?
[25:52.050 --> 25:52.190]  Oh.
[25:54.390 --> 25:55.530]  What do we...
[25:55.530 --> 25:55.850]  Go?
[25:56.290 --> 25:56.870]  Got something.
[25:57.190 --> 25:57.810]  Got a pool cue?
[25:58.250 --> 25:58.650]  Ow!
[26:00.870 --> 26:01.550]  You okay?
[26:01.690 --> 26:02.870]  The gate is electrified.
[26:03.610 --> 26:03.870]  Oh.
[26:04.890 --> 26:05.470]  I got a pool...
[26:05.470 --> 26:06.350]  I got a pool cue.
[26:06.490 --> 26:07.290]  Anti-electricity.
[26:07.830 --> 26:08.470]  You think I can...
[26:08.470 --> 26:09.230]  Oh, shit.
[26:09.230 --> 26:09.490]  Ah!
[26:10.650 --> 26:11.010]  Oh!
[26:12.350 --> 26:12.710]  Oh!
[26:14.130 --> 26:15.290]  Some home alone shit.
[26:15.430 --> 26:17.690]  Oh, Eric, come break the fuse box with the pool cue.
[26:17.710 --> 26:18.530]  Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
[26:18.630 --> 26:19.690]  You guys are all up there.
[26:20.210 --> 26:20.770]  Well, come up here.
[26:20.870 --> 26:21.550]  I'm gonna kick...
[26:21.550 --> 26:23.190]  I'm gonna kick a hole in the wall.
[26:23.370 --> 26:24.130]  I am out of the way.
[26:26.090 --> 26:27.090]  Oh, is it still...
[26:27.090 --> 26:27.610]  Maybe...
[26:27.610 --> 26:28.530]  Maybe it's not electrified.
[26:28.530 --> 26:29.250]  There's no maybe, Eric.
[26:29.530 --> 26:29.810]  I did it.
[26:29.990 --> 26:30.370]  Oh, sweet.
[26:30.570 --> 26:31.650]  Oh, good job, Gavin.
[26:31.650 --> 26:32.090]  Nice, thanks.
[26:32.570 --> 26:32.850]  What?
[26:34.090 --> 26:35.430]  Gavin, I'm glad you were on top of this.
[26:35.450 --> 26:36.970]  You absorbed all the electricity, so it stopped.
[26:37.630 --> 26:38.290]  Oh, my telephone.
[26:39.230 --> 26:40.350]  Oh, I got my phone.
[26:40.430 --> 26:41.350]  I don't want my phone.
[26:41.450 --> 26:41.810]  I want my...
[26:41.810 --> 26:43.190]  Now I can tweet that I'm free.
[26:45.630 --> 26:47.770]  Someone tweet 9-1-1.
[26:49.350 --> 26:50.250]  Wait, what are we...
[26:53.650 --> 26:54.370]  Oh, shit.
[26:55.610 --> 26:57.370]  That guy got mainly murdered by the door.
[26:58.390 --> 26:59.230]  Oh, you killed the guy?
[26:59.990 --> 27:00.330]  What'd you call me?
[27:00.330 --> 27:00.870]  Oh, there's guys over here?
[27:00.950 --> 27:01.530]  Yep, they're people.
[27:02.370 --> 27:03.450]  Oh, nice stick hit.
[27:03.450 --> 27:03.630]  I got you.
[27:04.710 --> 27:04.890]  Thanks.
[27:08.070 --> 27:09.050]  I've never played this.
[27:09.050 --> 27:09.510]  He's running.
[27:11.510 --> 27:12.830]  Oh, there's three of them.
[27:12.990 --> 27:13.910]  There's three of them.
[27:13.970 --> 27:14.110]  Yeah?
[27:14.370 --> 27:15.290]  How many of them now?
[27:15.350 --> 27:16.450]  Where did you get a gun?
[27:16.990 --> 27:18.290]  I found it on the table.
[27:19.090 --> 27:19.710]  Oh, I missed.
[27:19.810 --> 27:20.910]  Piece of shit.
[27:22.750 --> 27:24.150]  I'm taking my crowbar upstairs.
[27:25.010 --> 27:25.150]  Yeah.
[27:25.210 --> 27:25.910]  Oh, you got a gun.
[27:26.330 --> 27:26.510]  Cool.
[27:27.350 --> 27:28.030]  So, I got this pull key.
[27:28.090 --> 27:29.050]  It's working out for me so far.
[27:29.210 --> 27:30.730]  Shooting a lock will let you...
[27:31.170 --> 27:31.930]  I don't have a key.
[27:31.930 --> 27:33.990]  Find a way out of the farmhouse.
[27:34.410 --> 27:34.870]  Oh, I got a key.
[27:34.870 --> 27:36.910]  So, we just need to find the key.
[27:38.730 --> 27:39.730]  Oh, meth.
[27:40.190 --> 27:40.410]  Uh-oh.
[27:41.030 --> 27:41.670]  Oh, nice.
[27:41.910 --> 27:43.490]  Bring back any drugs, you see.
[27:44.090 --> 27:45.310]  Oh, can I take these?
[27:45.510 --> 27:45.870]  Hell yeah.
[27:46.330 --> 27:47.230]  I've got a drug.
[27:48.450 --> 27:49.290]  Grab drugs.
[27:49.990 --> 27:51.390]  Let's start a series of funding.
[27:51.650 --> 27:52.290]  Are you...
[27:52.290 --> 27:53.170]  Oh, I found my clothes.
[27:53.330 --> 27:53.530]  Where?
[27:55.410 --> 27:56.990]  In here, in a duffel bag.
[27:57.290 --> 27:57.390]  Really?
[27:57.670 --> 27:58.430]  Oh, oh.
[27:58.750 --> 27:59.690]  Oh, I've duffeled.
[28:00.170 --> 28:00.630]  Yeah.
[28:02.630 --> 28:03.550]  Rats back.
[28:04.870 --> 28:05.270]  Hey, what?
[28:06.990 --> 28:07.870]  There it is.
[28:08.590 --> 28:09.830]  Why aren't these windows breaking?
[28:10.650 --> 28:11.770]  Not... not weapons.
[28:13.110 --> 28:14.050]  Don't have the key.
[28:14.270 --> 28:14.410]  Oh.
[28:14.910 --> 28:15.490]  Didn't need it.
[28:18.430 --> 28:20.950]  Still trying to find a way out of this farmhouse.
[28:21.450 --> 28:21.630]  Yep.
[28:25.520 --> 28:26.500]  How do we get out?
[28:27.320 --> 28:28.200]  Oh, here we go.
[28:28.640 --> 28:29.580]  Hey, at the top, guys.
[28:32.400 --> 28:33.900]  Hey guys, the, uh...
[28:33.900 --> 28:34.580]  Upstairs?
[28:35.380 --> 28:35.720]  Yeah.
[28:36.220 --> 28:38.520]  In the room that I'm in, there's a way out.
[28:39.360 --> 28:39.900]  You guys aren't out?
[28:40.300 --> 28:41.240]  It sounds like Gav... no.
[28:42.700 --> 28:43.460]  I am not out.
[28:43.680 --> 28:44.900]  Oh, fuck, dude. I'm fucked.
[28:46.100 --> 28:46.560]  Shoot him.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.620]  I don't have any guns!
[28:48.920 --> 28:49.960]  What were you doing the whole time?
[28:50.340 --> 28:51.420]  I have a pool cue!
[28:52.520 --> 28:53.020]  Shoot him.
[28:53.160 --> 28:53.460]  Whack!
[28:55.240 --> 28:56.000]  Now I have a gun.
[28:56.100 --> 28:56.540]  Oh, shit.
[28:59.800 --> 29:00.520]  Oh, fuck.
[29:02.280 --> 29:03.860]  Hey, remember, you don't want to kill the target.
[29:04.420 --> 29:05.040]  Get in!
[29:07.880 --> 29:09.220]  Let's kill the guys around him.
[29:09.520 --> 29:11.380]  And then disarm him.
[29:21.470 --> 29:22.990]  Okay, securing the target.
[29:23.970 --> 29:24.770]  Damn, already?
[29:25.710 --> 29:26.030]  Yeah.
[29:27.470 --> 29:30.050]  Hey, I found all my weapons back here.
[29:30.670 --> 29:31.370]  Get in the car.
[29:31.510 --> 29:31.690]  Where?
[29:32.650 --> 29:35.330]  Uh, right where I am, there's a, uh...
[29:35.330 --> 29:35.710]  There you go.
[29:36.830 --> 29:37.690]  Probably get him back.
[29:38.510 --> 29:38.990]  Secured him.
[29:39.390 --> 29:39.750]  Nice.
[29:44.080 --> 29:45.260]  Alright, boys, let's do it.
[29:46.360 --> 29:47.640]  Do we have all our weapons?
[29:49.540 --> 29:50.420]  Uh, start hitting X.
[29:51.980 --> 29:52.580]  Sorry, Max.
[29:52.580 --> 29:53.420]  I got 16 bullets.
[29:54.040 --> 29:54.720]  Hang on, hang on.
[29:54.940 --> 29:55.320]  We should...
[29:55.320 --> 29:56.640]  All our weapons are still here.
[29:56.880 --> 29:57.780]  Yeah, we should get our weapons.
[29:58.360 --> 29:58.580]  Right?
[29:59.380 --> 30:00.420]  We'll get them back at the end, won't we?
[30:01.500 --> 30:02.300]  I'm not sure.
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.480]  I don't want to take that risk, do you?
[30:04.660 --> 30:07.260]  I don't want to lose, like, half a million dollars worth of weaponry.
[30:07.320 --> 30:07.780]  Yeah, exactly.
[30:09.640 --> 30:11.440]  I was starting to get him.
[30:12.260 --> 30:13.740]  It's not marked, it's just over here.
[30:15.280 --> 30:16.120]  Oh, shit!
[30:18.100 --> 30:18.760]  There we go.
[30:18.920 --> 30:19.560]  Retrieve your weapons.
[30:20.060 --> 30:20.840]  Did I get mine?
[30:20.940 --> 30:21.480]  Okay, I got them.
[30:21.720 --> 30:22.240]  Yeah, I got them all.
[30:22.360 --> 30:23.000]  They're all over here.
[30:24.320 --> 30:25.220]  Oh, is this outside?
[30:26.580 --> 30:26.960]  Yeah.
[30:27.320 --> 30:28.080]  There's a...
[30:28.080 --> 30:30.040]  It's marked gray bullets on the ground.
[30:31.260 --> 30:31.360]  Yeah.
[30:31.620 --> 30:32.940]  Are you driving some...
[30:32.940 --> 30:33.980]  Are you gone, Andrew?
[30:34.740 --> 30:35.160]  Yeah.
[30:35.380 --> 30:35.940]  Oh, Andrew's...
[30:35.940 --> 30:36.680]  Andrew's gone.
[30:37.440 --> 30:38.800]  I'm sure the weapons are fine.
[30:38.800 --> 30:39.600]  I don't see any weapons.
[30:40.400 --> 30:40.680]  Me neither.
[30:40.700 --> 30:40.820]  What?
[30:41.100 --> 30:41.740]  There's a...
[30:41.740 --> 30:42.060]  Oh, wait.
[30:42.200 --> 30:42.440]  Really?
[30:42.440 --> 30:44.060]  The prompt popped up somewhere.
[30:44.260 --> 30:44.960]  Yeah, the prompt is...
[30:44.960 --> 30:45.040]  There it is.
[30:45.040 --> 30:45.640]  It's right there.
[30:45.720 --> 30:46.000]  It's that.
[30:46.960 --> 30:49.360]  The prompt pops up in the weirdest...
[30:49.360 --> 30:49.380]  It's that...
[30:49.380 --> 30:50.240]  It's the box you're standing on.
[30:50.680 --> 30:51.520]  I know what it...
[30:51.520 --> 30:51.880]  I'm...
[30:51.880 --> 30:53.200]  I can't get a prompt, Eric.
[30:53.940 --> 30:54.500]  Yeah, I know.
[30:54.580 --> 30:54.920]  I got the prompt.
[30:54.940 --> 30:56.220]  I'm telling you that's what it is.
[30:56.440 --> 30:56.960]  I got it.
[30:58.920 --> 31:00.160]  I'm telling you that's what it is.
[31:00.440 --> 31:00.720]  All right.
[31:00.920 --> 31:01.480]  We have guns.
[31:01.520 --> 31:01.960]  Let's get out of here.
[31:02.400 --> 31:02.620]  Yeah.
[31:02.740 --> 31:03.140]  Bye, Gavin.
[31:03.880 --> 31:04.280]  Wait.
[31:04.500 --> 31:05.060]  Thanks for the car.
[31:06.260 --> 31:08.020]  Just grab the guns from under your feet, Gavin.
[31:08.140 --> 31:08.780]  They're in the...
[31:08.780 --> 31:08.900]  Hey.
[31:11.260 --> 31:12.060]  He tried...
[31:12.060 --> 31:13.080]  No, I didn't.
[31:13.140 --> 31:14.100]  He tried to blow up.
[31:14.180 --> 31:15.000]  He tried killing your car.
[31:15.300 --> 31:15.760]  Where's Andrew?
[31:17.100 --> 31:18.040]  I'm almost there.
[31:18.300 --> 31:18.700]  Andrew's gone.
[31:18.860 --> 31:19.800]  Delivering the first...
[31:19.800 --> 31:20.540]  Shortcut this thing.
[31:20.580 --> 31:20.880]  Let's go.
[31:21.080 --> 31:21.580]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[31:24.300 --> 31:24.600]  Woo.
[31:25.480 --> 31:27.080]  This is what happens when you're between the heists.
[31:28.640 --> 31:29.040]  Gavin.
[31:29.320 --> 31:29.540]  What?
[31:30.260 --> 31:30.840]  After the...
[31:30.840 --> 31:31.440]  Did you shoot at us?
[31:34.780 --> 31:36.120]  Do you shoot at a tire?
[31:38.380 --> 31:39.420]  Or is that already like...
[31:39.420 --> 31:39.520]  Oh, shit.
[31:39.520 --> 31:40.320]  We're on rims.
[31:41.160 --> 31:43.420]  I may have pulled out a sniper as you crested the hill.
[31:45.800 --> 31:48.120]  Oh, so you got your weapons back.
[31:48.340 --> 31:48.780]  Hey, good.
[31:48.880 --> 31:49.560]  Hey, good for you.
[31:50.160 --> 31:50.520]  Congratulations, Gavin.
[31:50.820 --> 31:51.080]  Cheers.
[31:51.220 --> 31:51.720]  Half a million.
[31:51.920 --> 31:53.960]  Did you figure out that it was the box that you were standing on?
[31:57.360 --> 31:57.720]  Gavin.
[31:58.660 --> 31:58.920]  Yep.
[31:59.640 --> 32:01.320]  He's trying to use the sniper rifle again.
[32:02.260 --> 32:03.340]  Oh, get off this mountain.
[32:03.620 --> 32:04.660]  Get off this mountain.
[32:04.980 --> 32:05.360]  You're right.
[32:05.400 --> 32:06.220]  We gotta get out of here.
[32:06.800 --> 32:07.580]  Bringing them in.
[32:07.760 --> 32:08.400]  Why don't you come back?
[32:10.320 --> 32:11.260]  Oh, nice.
[32:11.320 --> 32:13.440]  I'm afraid I can't hear you over this mountain.
[32:13.920 --> 32:14.400]  Yeah!
[32:15.400 --> 32:16.500]  You did it, Andrew.
[32:17.580 --> 32:18.060]  Delivered.
[32:18.500 --> 32:19.400]  We all did it, Nick.
[32:19.760 --> 32:20.440]  Oh-ho!
[32:21.440 --> 32:22.360]  We're racing out.
[32:22.540 --> 32:24.740]  Our car just getting slammed into the ground.
[32:25.520 --> 32:26.660]  Them Duke boys are taking off again.
[32:26.660 --> 32:27.120]  Extra 10,000.
[32:31.870 --> 32:32.250]  Nice.
[32:33.590 --> 32:34.330]  Oh, beautiful.
[32:35.370 --> 32:36.710]  Let's throw him in jail.
[32:40.650 --> 32:41.130]  Uh...
[32:44.490 --> 32:45.130]  Hell yeah.
[32:49.610 --> 32:50.550]  Oh, good job, guys.
[32:50.710 --> 32:51.030]  Nice.
[32:53.150 --> 32:55.370]  Let's see if Leroy calls when we get outside.
[32:57.150 --> 32:58.230]  The guy that we just captured?
[32:58.390 --> 32:58.730]  Or Lester.
[32:59.450 --> 33:00.730]  No, yeah, Lester. Sorry.
[33:02.470 --> 33:04.010]  I got caught up in the LEs.
[33:04.110 --> 33:04.550]  Yeah, I understand.
[33:06.270 --> 33:07.470]  I'm gonna go to my arcade.
[33:08.050 --> 33:08.550]  Yeah, dude.
[33:08.690 --> 33:09.630]  You guys wanna come to my arcade?
[33:10.110 --> 33:10.310]  Yeah.
[33:10.370 --> 33:11.210]  It's right across the street.
[33:11.570 --> 33:11.950]  Do it.
[33:11.950 --> 33:14.110]  Are you driving there?
[33:14.710 --> 33:15.730]  Uh, Gavin?
[33:16.890 --> 33:17.910]  No, Gavin.
[33:18.090 --> 33:18.190]  What?
[33:18.850 --> 33:19.330]  Gavin?
[33:21.090 --> 33:21.610]  Gavin!
[33:22.890 --> 33:24.190]  Well, I can't...
[33:24.190 --> 33:24.550]  I think...
[33:24.550 --> 33:25.390]  No, maybe I can.
[33:25.890 --> 33:26.230]  What?
[33:27.970 --> 33:29.470]  Uh, Gavin got us a wanted level.
[33:29.770 --> 33:32.830]  I wasn't sure if it would let me go into the arcade.
[33:34.610 --> 33:35.670]  Here's my arcade.
[33:43.080 --> 33:43.880]  There he is.
[33:44.040 --> 33:44.460]  There we go.
[33:45.380 --> 33:47.260]  Oh, he's sitting on a claw machine.
[33:48.340 --> 33:49.300]  Pixel Pete's.
[33:49.360 --> 33:49.980]  Pixel Pete!
[33:50.440 --> 33:51.120]  Uh, Pixel Pete!
[33:51.220 --> 33:51.560]  Pixel Pete!
[33:53.440 --> 33:57.600]  I hate the game inside a game activities.
[33:58.400 --> 33:58.660]  Yeah.
[33:59.020 --> 33:59.480]  Oh, really?
[33:59.740 --> 34:00.260]  Yeah, they suck.
[34:00.360 --> 34:00.760]  They're not fun.
[34:01.460 --> 34:02.520]  Yeah, they're not fun.
[34:03.460 --> 34:05.300]  This arcade sucks shit, Andrew.
[34:05.460 --> 34:09.540]  You didn't like playing Crash Bandicoot in Uncharted 4?
[34:10.100 --> 34:11.440]  No, you know what I wanted?
[34:11.560 --> 34:12.460]  I wanted to play Uncharted 4.
[34:13.700 --> 34:14.100]  Huh.
[34:14.740 --> 34:16.580]  Well, it turns out that Nathan Drake didn't.
[34:17.320 --> 34:17.520]  Yeah.
[34:18.600 --> 34:20.680]  My Zoltar knockoff is talking to me.
[34:21.560 --> 34:23.160]  Do you want to play four-player Gang Wars?
[34:23.620 --> 34:23.780]  Yeah.
[34:23.960 --> 34:24.120]  No.
[34:25.360 --> 34:25.760]  Okay.
[34:26.420 --> 34:27.160]  Where am I?
[34:27.300 --> 34:28.360]  Am I in, like, the back of this thing?
[34:29.860 --> 34:30.720]  Are we in different places?
[34:30.720 --> 34:31.940]  This is the setup for another heist.
[34:32.140 --> 34:32.880]  This is this area.
[34:34.260 --> 34:35.540]  How do I get to where you are?
[34:36.380 --> 34:37.740]  Oh, can I check my love?
[34:40.340 --> 34:43.600]  I wonder if I'm sizzling or if I'm ice cold.
[34:44.320 --> 34:46.560]  Am I not where you guys are?
[34:48.620 --> 34:49.620]  I don't know.
[34:49.780 --> 34:52.020]  I'm just in, like, an empty warehouse.
[34:53.720 --> 34:54.700]  Can we do it together?
[34:56.320 --> 34:57.800]  After all these heists, let's see.
[34:58.040 --> 34:58.960]  Let's check our love.
[34:59.860 --> 35:01.800]  Yeah, let's see where we're at.

[35:05.060 --> 35:05.780]  What we got, Gavin?
[35:06.920 --> 35:07.720]  Oh, we're up!
[35:07.720 --> 35:08.280]  I'm ice cold!
[35:08.280 --> 35:09.500]  Yeah, I'm ice cold with Andrew.
[35:09.660 --> 35:10.180]  I'm ice cold!
[35:10.260 --> 35:11.980]  Maybe I'm different with Nick.
[35:12.820 --> 35:13.600]  Oh, yeah, here, here, here.
[35:13.640 --> 35:15.080]  Get in here. Let's see, let's see, let's see.

[35:25.720 --> 35:27.680]  You better not be better than ice cold.
[35:27.960 --> 35:29.360]  You better not be better than the bottom.
[35:30.100 --> 35:30.540]  Ice cold!
[35:30.880 --> 35:31.500]  Oh, no!
[35:32.020 --> 35:32.160]  No!
[35:33.360 --> 35:33.720]  Clammy!
[35:34.200 --> 35:34.560]  Oh!
[35:35.180 --> 35:36.280]  I'm clammy with Nick!
[35:36.380 --> 35:37.460]  I'm hot and heavy!
[35:38.280 --> 35:39.320]  Oh, Nick, really?
[35:39.500 --> 35:40.020]  Alright, alright.
[35:40.140 --> 35:41.060]  Let's get Eric in here.
[35:41.140 --> 35:41.600]  Yeah, let me see.
[35:47.820 --> 35:48.140]  Okay.
[35:48.940 --> 35:49.580]  Learned a lot today.
[35:49.580 --> 35:51.440]  Alright, I was ice cold with Andrew and clammy with Nick.
[35:51.520 --> 35:51.840]  Yep.
[35:53.440 --> 35:54.400]  I was hot and heavy.
[35:54.720 --> 35:55.780]  We're sizzling, I can feel it.
[35:55.800 --> 35:57.700]  Oh, this is team tape. Let's see where team tape's at.
[35:57.760 --> 35:58.160]  Oh, yeah.
[36:00.340 --> 36:01.240]  Oh, they're pretty close.
[36:01.480 --> 36:02.460]  Let Nick and I in here.
[36:02.580 --> 36:04.660]  Let's see, yeah, no bad ideas is that on the one side.
[36:04.660 --> 36:05.480]  No bad ideas.
[36:05.480 --> 36:06.960]  I'm cold shoulder with Gavin.
[36:07.460 --> 36:07.900]  I just need that.
[36:08.400 --> 36:08.720]  Sizzling.
[36:09.580 --> 36:10.440]  Oh, you're lower than me?
[36:11.100 --> 36:11.420]  Yeah.
[36:13.400 --> 36:14.580]  Yeah, we each get our own ratings.
[36:15.560 --> 36:16.200]  Here we go.
[36:18.160 --> 36:19.060]  Let's see where we're at.
[36:19.140 --> 36:20.760]  No bad ideas is going to be high on that board.
[36:20.840 --> 36:21.560]  It's going to be sizzling.
[36:21.600 --> 36:22.980]  Oh, you're going to be high on that.
[36:23.000 --> 36:23.900]  It's going to be sizzling.
[36:24.260 --> 36:24.580]  Climbing!
[36:24.880 --> 36:24.960]  Yeah!
[36:24.960 --> 36:25.820]  It's climbing!
[36:26.240 --> 36:27.220]  The good vibes!
[36:28.120 --> 36:29.440]  Getting steamy and flushed.
[36:30.600 --> 36:31.080]  Uh-huh.
[36:31.300 --> 36:32.540]  Woo, doggy!
[36:33.760 --> 36:34.880]  Okay, I'm going to get out of here and see you.
[36:35.060 --> 36:36.040]  That's some chemistry, baby.
[36:38.180 --> 36:38.980]  I'm getting my fortune.
[36:40.720 --> 36:42.100]  I wish I was big.
[36:43.320 --> 36:43.720]  No!
[36:47.800 --> 36:50.640]  I see a man in a white shirt and a red vest.
[36:51.120 --> 36:52.220]  He's afraid of your work.
[36:52.900 --> 36:53.540]  That's Nick.
[36:54.480 --> 36:54.880]  What?
[36:55.060 --> 36:56.140]  She just described Nick.
[36:56.680 --> 36:57.620]  I don't think that's true.
[36:58.300 --> 36:59.260]  He's afraid of your work?
[36:59.360 --> 37:00.200]  That's what it said!
[37:00.900 --> 37:01.640]  You're afraid of my work?
[37:01.800 --> 37:02.580]  Give me a call.
[37:02.800 --> 37:08.260]  What if they made a sequel to Big where he was as big as he was in Big and he goes to try and find that woman?
[37:10.440 --> 37:11.600]  And she's 89.
[37:14.620 --> 37:16.500]  Years ago, ma'am.
[37:17.320 --> 37:19.040]  I mean, they could have met up later in life.
[37:19.940 --> 37:20.300]  Definitely.
[37:21.320 --> 37:24.660]  Can you imagine if he met up with her later in life and then she became small?
[37:26.940 --> 37:27.940]  Big German button.
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.320]  Well, unless you guys find something to do, I think we should wrap this up.
[37:33.420 --> 37:34.040]  I think that's it.
[37:34.320 --> 37:34.760]  This is sad.
[37:34.760 --> 37:35.400]  I think we gotta wait.
[37:36.220 --> 37:41.360]  I'll make sure Lester calls for next time when we start the final heist!
[37:41.480 --> 37:43.360]  You can't start a heist from the menu.
[37:44.200 --> 37:45.860]  Yeah, you can just go to the menu and start the heist.
[37:46.440 --> 37:49.180]  I can't because I haven't done it yet. I can't initiate it.
[37:50.740 --> 37:51.060]  Menu.
[37:51.220 --> 37:52.100]  You just gotta go to the menu.
[37:52.440 --> 37:53.440]  Okay, I'll look at the menu.
[37:53.700 --> 37:55.360]  I'll check next time. Maybe Gavin is right.
[37:55.460 --> 37:55.640]  Next time.
[37:55.780 --> 37:57.000]  We can just start it right now.
[37:57.100 --> 37:57.600]  Let's do it right now.
[37:58.340 --> 37:59.200]  Yeah, I don't think it's crazy.
[37:59.320 --> 37:59.860]  Let's look at the menu.
[38:00.760 --> 38:02.220]  Okay, let me just go to the menu.
[38:02.740 --> 38:04.100]  Okay, let me quit to the main menu.
[38:04.620 --> 38:05.100]  Let's see.
[38:06.640 --> 38:07.760]  Let's see if he's correct.
[38:08.780 --> 38:11.220]  I can't believe you named your organization an organization.
[38:12.080 --> 38:12.560]  I can't.
[38:13.820 --> 38:15.440]  Oh, I can purchase a garage right here.
[38:15.740 --> 38:18.000]  Okay, I'm on online now. What do I do? I see bully.
[38:18.180 --> 38:18.520]  No, no, no, menu.
[38:18.560 --> 38:19.200]  Do I click bully?
[38:19.760 --> 38:20.380]  Yeah, you gotta go to the menu.
[38:20.540 --> 38:20.780]  Heists.
[38:22.600 --> 38:23.080]  Main menu.
[38:23.180 --> 38:25.820]  Heists, and then I have all these ones. Yeah, I'm in the main menu.
[38:29.540 --> 38:29.860]  Ah!
[38:30.740 --> 38:31.940]  Gotta go to the menu, I think.
[38:33.020 --> 38:33.940]  What is the...
[38:39.100 --> 38:40.260]  Still entering online.
[38:40.760 --> 38:41.240]  Fuck!
[38:41.800 --> 38:42.960]  Oh my god.
[38:44.140 --> 38:44.520]  Joked.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.260]  Okay, loaded in.
[38:47.460 --> 38:48.080]  It did nothing.
[38:50.460 --> 38:53.200]  All it did was put me in a session, an open session.
[38:54.720 --> 38:55.260]  Oh no!
[38:55.380 --> 38:55.920]  Where did you go?
[38:55.940 --> 38:56.300]  Oh no!
[38:57.820 --> 39:01.460]  Went, and I clicked heists, and then I clicked the heists that we do next.
[39:01.940 --> 39:04.560]  And it loaded nothing, because I haven't done it before.
[39:04.940 --> 39:08.000]  It's put me in an open GTA Online session.
[39:08.380 --> 39:12.000]  So take that, Gavin, you son of a gun!
[39:13.280 --> 39:13.360]  Huh.
[39:13.900 --> 39:14.520]  Didn't work.
[39:15.040 --> 39:16.460]  It was a good idea, though. I appreciate this.
[39:17.460 --> 39:20.280]  Anyway, thank you so much for watching this video.
[39:20.360 --> 39:20.840]  Whoa!
[39:20.840 --> 39:21.460]  We got a podcast.
[39:22.100 --> 39:25.600]  We got a Patreon, the regulation pod on there.
[39:26.220 --> 39:31.480]  And yeah, definitely isn't letting me do anything except check out those videos.
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.760]  And we'll be back soon with the finale of the original heists.
[39:37.280 --> 39:39.140]  CoopTech54 is very excited about it.
[39:39.220 --> 39:39.560]  Bye!
