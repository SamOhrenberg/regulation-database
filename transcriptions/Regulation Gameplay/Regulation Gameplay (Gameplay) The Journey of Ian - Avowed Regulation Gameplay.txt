[00:00.000 --> 00:02.640]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:02.700 --> 00:04.460]  Today, we're playing a Vowed.
[00:04.480 --> 00:07.180]  First of all, before we get started, a huge thanks to Xbox
[00:07.960 --> 00:11.240]  for allowing us to preview this game early so we can release this
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.360]  when it comes out.
[00:12.520 --> 00:13.500]  Did you call it a Vowed?
[00:13.900 --> 00:16.000]  Yeah, I do. I wasn't I wasn't going to say anything.
[00:16.140 --> 00:17.120]  A Vowed, a Vowed, a Vowed.
[00:17.340 --> 00:19.740]  Did you just go through puberty when you said out?
[00:20.340 --> 00:23.460]  What? Andrew, I thought you did a great intro.
[00:23.520 --> 00:25.300]  I'm changing. I thought you did great.
[00:25.360 --> 00:26.020]  Through the seasons.
[00:26.320 --> 00:28.940]  Uh-huh. The same way that you're changing in a Vowed, right?
[00:28.940 --> 00:31.560]  Yes, exactly, Eric. Thank you.
[00:31.640 --> 00:35.000]  Yeah, it looks like it's fall on your head, but winter on your legs.
[00:37.140 --> 00:38.160]  He's got a winter lap.
[00:38.240 --> 00:38.920]  So we're going to start a new game.
[00:38.980 --> 00:39.480]  This is Aura.
[00:39.940 --> 00:41.440]  This is part of a
[00:42.640 --> 00:43.900]  different game series,
[00:44.440 --> 00:47.440]  but it's like the same world, but a different story.
[00:48.360 --> 00:50.400]  The same world, but a different story of what?
[00:50.760 --> 00:51.140]  Yeah, what?
[00:52.400 --> 00:55.000]  Oh, uh, Pillars of Eternity?
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.900]  Oh, yes. Oh, cool.
[00:56.900 --> 01:00.000]  So this is like a spinoff of the Pillars of Eternity
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.420]  or just like a self-contained story set in that universe.
[01:03.620 --> 01:05.440]  Yes. Oh, that's cool. I like that.
[01:05.920 --> 01:06.600]  You should do that more.
[01:07.140 --> 01:10.100]  Would you do you think this this game will count as one of the pillars
[01:10.100 --> 01:14.180]  at some point? Oh, I don't know.
[01:14.240 --> 01:17.920]  I feel like the hardcore pillars sayings probably would disagree.
[01:18.180 --> 01:21.340]  I think they're probably pretty protective of their pillars, I'd assume.
[01:22.920 --> 01:24.360]  I wonder what they call themselves.
[01:24.360 --> 01:25.780]  I bet Pillarators.
[01:26.500 --> 01:28.220]  I reckon it's. Pillages.
[01:28.820 --> 01:29.860]  I wish I was one.
[01:30.060 --> 01:32.700]  I just I never they were on PC and I never played them.
[01:32.840 --> 01:35.180]  But I hear nothing but amazing things about those games.
[01:38.360 --> 01:39.320]  Ah, Paradis.
[01:40.100 --> 01:42.260]  Yes. Ah, yeah. Living lands.
[01:42.960 --> 01:44.620]  It's a wild, dangerous place.
[01:44.680 --> 01:45.380]  The living lands.
[01:46.280 --> 01:46.940]  It is. Roots.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.460]  Whoa. Oh, snap.
[01:50.120 --> 01:51.160]  What happened? Building.
[01:54.360 --> 01:55.140]  I love the art.
[01:55.580 --> 01:56.760]  This is very cool.
[01:57.500 --> 02:01.180]  Yeah, it kind of reminds me of the art from the Walking Dead comic a little bit.
[02:01.460 --> 02:02.380]  And some of them. Sure.
[02:02.940 --> 02:03.780]  Yeah, I can see that.
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.420]  They made a game called Pentament that was very art focused.
[02:08.880 --> 02:12.500]  And they consistently pull off amazing art.
[02:13.920 --> 02:14.880]  So you're a godlike.
[02:15.420 --> 02:16.020]  That's cool.
[02:16.500 --> 02:19.380]  Oh, God touched you in the womb.
[02:19.860 --> 02:22.140]  It's pretty disturbing looking being a godlike.
[02:22.140 --> 02:22.900]  I can't. Yeah.
[02:24.460 --> 02:27.100]  It is not subtle if you are a godlike.
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.560]  I feel like some some godlike options can kind of hinder the ability of sight.
[02:33.600 --> 02:34.540]  Sure. Yes.
[02:38.140 --> 02:40.660]  Like when the kid was getting bullied, I thought, well, how did they know?
[02:40.740 --> 02:42.960]  And then you go, we're going to make a character in a minute.
[02:43.080 --> 02:45.000]  And it's oh, OK.
[02:45.860 --> 02:48.560]  I can't wait to see the characters everybody made individually.
[02:49.880 --> 02:52.080]  Yeah, it's going to we're going to record a different thing later.
[02:52.080 --> 02:53.940]  And I'm excited to see Geoff and Gavin.
[02:54.060 --> 02:56.340]  I went with the fruit basket vibe.
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.580]  We have presets, but let's just move in our body type.
[03:00.700 --> 03:01.580]  Who what are we thinking?
[03:02.040 --> 03:03.860]  Well, we want to be Ian, right? I want a head.
[03:04.220 --> 03:05.780]  Yeah, we are Ian. Oh, OK.
[03:06.980 --> 03:10.140]  So let's I mean, he's we want one of these four.
[03:10.260 --> 03:12.020]  Yeah, I mean, he is known for dude.
[03:12.340 --> 03:14.080]  Yeah, and he's known for ears, right?
[03:14.100 --> 03:15.740]  So I mean, like you don't you don't.
[03:15.860 --> 03:17.880]  Yeah, but I'm afraid that you give him those ears.
[03:17.920 --> 03:20.780]  But honestly, maybe this is like an Ian reimagining.
[03:20.780 --> 03:23.900]  Like maybe you have to consider Ian in different settings.
[03:24.080 --> 03:25.480]  Like this is a baby, right?
[03:25.540 --> 03:27.040]  This is a standalone Ian, right?
[03:27.260 --> 03:29.520]  Like this is we take the we take it.
[03:30.420 --> 03:32.320]  Yeah, we take we take a canon Ian
[03:32.320 --> 03:34.820]  and we make him in his own standalone type game.
[03:35.260 --> 03:38.800]  It's if Ian was touched in the womb by Wow.
[03:39.340 --> 03:41.400]  God, God type Ian or whatever.
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.160]  This is great.
[03:42.860 --> 03:46.440]  I'm because Ian, our drawing of Ian is pretty like bright white.
[03:46.540 --> 03:48.620]  Trying to get as white as I can.
[03:48.700 --> 03:50.360]  A real alabaster. I get it.
[03:50.360 --> 03:52.900]  Yeah, yeah, this is as white as I can get.
[03:53.020 --> 03:54.980]  OK, OK, OK, let's
[03:56.300 --> 03:58.860]  we're not doing any of the presets.
[03:59.240 --> 04:02.500]  Well, OK, so this is the godlike features we're talking about.
[04:02.860 --> 04:04.660]  Oh, I see. This is why they got their ass kicked.
[04:05.140 --> 04:07.620]  It's like a yes. Yeah, it's like a think of it as like a flourish.
[04:09.220 --> 04:12.180]  Do pick the bottom left one to see what I was talking about.
[04:13.180 --> 04:14.360]  Yeah. Oh, my God.
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.680]  Oh, my God.
[04:15.800 --> 04:18.120]  That's if you've got Groot face, Groot face.
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.320]  And next to it is like fruit arrangement head.
[04:21.480 --> 04:22.380]  Yeah, no kidding.
[04:23.220 --> 04:24.460]  Yeah, that's Carmen Miranda.
[04:24.660 --> 04:25.880]  Real like last like.
[04:26.360 --> 04:28.220]  Oh, they got some cordyceps up and below.
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.140]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
[04:29.300 --> 04:32.820]  Wow. You got cordyceps you can see through and cordyceps that you can't see through.
[04:33.060 --> 04:34.100]  Yeah, that's kind of cool.
[04:34.360 --> 04:36.940]  Mm hmm. He has racing stripes on that one.
[04:39.260 --> 04:41.660]  So you can pick these. Oh, my God.
[04:42.260 --> 04:44.760]  What we can do is have them set, but we can turn them off.
[04:44.760 --> 04:46.780]  So like in the universe, they see them.
[04:46.780 --> 04:49.540]  But like if we want to customize. Oh, specifically.
[04:49.880 --> 04:52.060]  OK, I think seeing them is the most important part.
[04:52.180 --> 04:53.040]  Yeah. Yeah. OK.
[04:53.100 --> 04:56.780]  I think you should do either the leaf one in the second row all the way to the right.
[04:59.880 --> 05:00.600]  Very interesting.
[05:02.360 --> 05:06.020]  But if we're trying to keep a base, Ian, then I think it would be the second one
[05:06.020 --> 05:06.760]  on the top row.
[05:08.160 --> 05:09.120]  Second one on the top.
[05:09.240 --> 05:10.480]  Oh, you think we think in this?
[05:10.600 --> 05:13.600]  That's that. That to me is one where if he's leaning back,
[05:13.640 --> 05:15.440]  you wouldn't even know that he's a godlike.
[05:15.440 --> 05:18.400]  If he's looking up, you would have no idea he's a godlike.
[05:18.540 --> 05:20.000]  That's just something to think about.
[05:20.080 --> 05:21.520]  But I like the leaf in the bottom, right?
[05:21.640 --> 05:22.660]  That's just that's my pick.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.620]  Well, you know, let's do like an egg.
[05:24.740 --> 05:27.620]  We'll start with Eric. Oh, OK. Choices. OK.
[05:27.960 --> 05:30.600]  So now, Gavin or Geoff.
[05:31.020 --> 05:33.220]  Geoff, right? Yeah, that's me. I'm Geoff. Geoff and then Gavin.
[05:34.020 --> 05:35.980]  What we pick for this? An egg. OK.
[05:36.800 --> 05:39.360]  Yeah, we're starting at the E. OK, I'm starting with egg.
[05:40.780 --> 05:44.080]  But why? Because Eric had preferences
[05:44.080 --> 05:45.580]  and no one else vocalized preferences.
[05:45.700 --> 05:47.100]  Oh, they're starting with the E.
[05:47.140 --> 05:49.040]  It's true. So now it's me.
[05:49.120 --> 05:50.400]  It's like what our meetings are like.
[05:50.520 --> 05:51.580]  Then we would have start with the end.
[05:51.660 --> 05:55.520]  It wouldn't I like the asymmetry of the what appears to be
[05:55.520 --> 05:58.040]  the Karma Miranda-esque underwater fruit basket.
[05:59.360 --> 06:01.400]  This one, I say go for it.
[06:01.920 --> 06:03.800]  And you want it visible or do we want to turn it off?
[06:03.860 --> 06:04.540]  I want it visible.
[06:04.680 --> 06:07.480]  I don't see the point of having it if I'm not going to show it off to the world.
[06:07.560 --> 06:09.740]  It's true. It's true. Yeah. OK.
[06:11.000 --> 06:13.340]  Gavin. Oh, we got hair.
[06:13.340 --> 06:16.680]  Now you got you got a little bit of an obstruction on the hair side.
[06:16.800 --> 06:18.400]  Could you go to the third one on the top row?
[06:19.300 --> 06:20.400]  Third one. Top row.
[06:20.500 --> 06:22.640]  I mean, this is the ultimate comb over. Excuse me.
[06:22.880 --> 06:25.060]  This is the ultimate comb over.
[06:25.340 --> 06:26.180]  I don't need to see.
[06:27.560 --> 06:29.320]  It's just a fancy toupee.
[06:30.340 --> 06:32.420]  That's it. They'll never know I'm bald.
[06:32.920 --> 06:34.560]  Wait, just quickly scroll through the rest.
[06:34.620 --> 06:35.820]  Just want to glance. Yeah. Yeah.
[06:35.820 --> 06:36.780]  Let's go through the rest.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.940]  If there's any that catch your eye of them.
[06:39.200 --> 06:40.620]  Wow. There's a lot of hair.
[06:40.960 --> 06:42.480]  No, I'll stick with the one we got.
[06:42.480 --> 06:44.480]  OK. OK. Now we got to go color.
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.920]  What are you thinking for shade?
[06:48.560 --> 06:50.540]  White. White.
[06:50.740 --> 06:51.780]  OK, we're sticking white.
[06:55.120 --> 06:57.320]  Take all the saturation out.
[06:58.740 --> 07:01.220]  Yeah. Wow. Oh, there.
[07:01.420 --> 07:04.160]  Oh, look at this gray haired beauty.
[07:04.880 --> 07:05.920]  Silver fox.
[07:06.800 --> 07:08.540]  Like a real Anderson Cooper here.
[07:08.780 --> 07:10.540]  Yeah, really. Does this matter?
[07:11.080 --> 07:12.180]  Can we go more white?
[07:12.640 --> 07:14.800]  You might be able to take the saturation out.
[07:15.200 --> 07:16.880]  Yeah. Oh, boy.
[07:17.860 --> 07:19.520]  I can't tell. I think that's about.
[07:19.660 --> 07:20.800]  I think it's as white as it gets.
[07:20.920 --> 07:24.400]  That's like that's like owning a Lincoln Navigator white.
[07:24.740 --> 07:25.900]  Yeah. Yeah.
[07:25.960 --> 07:28.040]  I love the facial hair options in this game.
[07:28.140 --> 07:30.020]  OK, I'm glad I get to pick this.
[07:30.280 --> 07:31.820]  Uh huh. We got that.
[07:34.180 --> 07:35.700]  That's like Geoff. Look.
[07:36.020 --> 07:37.340]  Hey, what's up? I'm Geoff.
[07:41.160 --> 07:43.640]  Oh, I mean, that's I like the V a lot.
[07:43.640 --> 07:45.660]  We on a right. So this is Andrew.
[07:45.900 --> 07:47.400]  Yeah, this is can you show me?
[07:47.620 --> 07:49.500]  Can you show go up one from here?
[07:50.600 --> 07:52.020]  OK, I just want to see it.
[07:55.360 --> 07:59.520]  Well, I mean, Ian would not have anything.
[07:59.820 --> 08:02.320]  It's true. But you can pick nothing if you want to pick.
[08:02.440 --> 08:03.400]  There's nothing to vary.
[08:03.580 --> 08:04.420]  I you know what?
[08:04.420 --> 08:06.740]  I would like to see what this face would look like.
[08:06.860 --> 08:09.160]  I'm looking a real let me kill Mr. That's fine.
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.140]  Yeah. Yeah. Let me.
[08:11.380 --> 08:12.940]  Uh huh. Now, what about hair color?
[08:12.940 --> 08:13.540]  What are you thinking?
[08:13.860 --> 08:15.680]  Yeah, I'm thinking I'm thinking blue.
[08:15.980 --> 08:17.760]  Oh, let's go for a bright.
[08:17.980 --> 08:21.740]  I mean, anything to take your eyes away from his actual hair.
[08:21.740 --> 08:24.060]  I get that. I guess it's kind of a purple.
[08:24.320 --> 08:26.520]  And it's a well, purple is the most regal color.
[08:26.680 --> 08:28.380]  Turn the brightness up to make it blue.
[08:28.980 --> 08:31.060]  It's a real Dario Nahara situation.
[08:31.400 --> 08:33.900]  Yeah. And I think if you set the facial highlight color to blue,
[08:33.920 --> 08:35.040]  I think you'll get a lot of blue there.
[08:36.700 --> 08:37.660]  Yeah. From the book.
[08:37.840 --> 08:39.400]  OK, let's do the same. I got you.
[08:39.520 --> 08:40.800]  I got you. Yes. Thank you, man.
[08:42.560 --> 08:43.900]  Oh, thank you, Dario.
[08:43.900 --> 08:46.600]  No, not Harris. How did you say it?
[08:46.640 --> 08:47.300]  Not Harris. What?
[08:47.900 --> 08:49.120]  Harris. Harris.
[08:49.660 --> 08:51.280]  Where's everybody? Keep trying.
[08:52.720 --> 08:54.580]  I don't know. Wow. Well, it's more purple.
[08:54.780 --> 08:56.980]  I think it's a lot more purple, but I'm OK with it.
[08:57.200 --> 08:58.280]  Yeah, I like it. Yeah.
[08:58.640 --> 09:00.020]  It matches your tonic.
[09:00.600 --> 09:02.520]  Yep. Hey, Nick, you're picking her eyes.
[09:02.900 --> 09:05.280]  Now, Nick, you got you got a lot of you got a lot of numbers.
[09:05.540 --> 09:07.460]  Big eyes. Oh, make them as big as possible.
[09:07.760 --> 09:09.360]  Little eyes. Oh, my.
[09:09.580 --> 09:10.440]  As big as possible.
[09:10.440 --> 09:12.020]  And as far apart as possible.
[09:12.260 --> 09:13.880]  Oh, big as possible.
[09:14.920 --> 09:15.800]  This is exactly.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.480]  Up or down. You want to low or high?
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.320]  Oh, I like them low.
[09:19.520 --> 09:21.520]  Yeah, I like them low too. I think that's good.
[09:21.840 --> 09:23.000]  Yeah, I think so. Spread them out.
[09:23.360 --> 09:24.780]  As far. There we go.
[09:24.960 --> 09:25.800]  Oh, my God.
[09:27.800 --> 09:29.180]  And now we got depth.
[09:29.240 --> 09:30.840]  Oh, yeah. You got to push it forward.
[09:31.240 --> 09:32.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:32.640 --> 09:34.340]  I don't. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:34.380 --> 09:36.540]  Sunken in is you want them in or out, Nick?
[09:37.280 --> 09:38.720]  Uh, let's look at it from the front.
[09:38.760 --> 09:39.700]  I want to see what it looks like from the front.
[09:39.700 --> 09:40.700]  Hey, that's from the.
[09:40.720 --> 09:41.700]  Yeah, in's good.
[09:42.480 --> 09:43.100]  You think so?
[09:43.220 --> 09:46.700]  Yeah, you want to keep them out.
[09:46.800 --> 09:47.280]  Let's go out.
[09:47.520 --> 09:47.960]  Let's go out.
[09:47.960 --> 09:48.620]  We're going out.
[09:48.960 --> 09:49.220]  Eyes out.
[09:49.380 --> 09:49.680]  OK.
[09:51.640 --> 09:52.540]  Angle of eyes.
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.040]  They I think it's like it's hard when you go to a
[09:57.040 --> 09:58.720]  when you go to 100 percent.
[09:58.940 --> 10:01.960]  He looks like he's got like a droopy dog kind of situation.
[10:02.780 --> 10:04.480]  Like go all the way up.
[10:04.560 --> 10:04.980]  Go all the way.
[10:05.040 --> 10:05.600]  Yeah, go all the way up.
[10:05.880 --> 10:06.540]  No, that's cool.
[10:06.580 --> 10:07.120]  You went down.
[10:08.880 --> 10:09.680]  Oh, yeah, I do.
[10:09.700 --> 10:10.520]  I see some droopy.
[10:10.700 --> 10:11.980]  Oh, I see some droopy dog.
[10:12.160 --> 10:12.680]  Yeah, do it.
[10:12.900 --> 10:16.140]  It's like his beard sides are weighing his face down.
[10:18.640 --> 10:19.680]  Heavy facial hair.
[10:20.120 --> 10:21.740]  I think his eyes should be really bright.
[10:21.880 --> 10:22.880]  Something light color.
[10:23.340 --> 10:24.020]  Right. Light.
[10:24.260 --> 10:25.200]  OK. Yeah.
[10:25.320 --> 10:26.480]  Oh, shiny.
[10:27.900 --> 10:29.760]  And do a bit of goldeneye.
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.080]  Yeah. Oh, all the way.
[10:33.320 --> 10:34.620]  Yeah. Oh, my God.
[10:34.620 --> 10:36.500]  He's really puffy.
[10:37.100 --> 10:38.000]  It's like good.
[10:38.600 --> 10:39.340]  Darren of the two pools.
[10:39.480 --> 10:40.040]  We're good with them.
[10:40.340 --> 10:43.220]  So we can change individual eye color if we want.
[10:43.320 --> 10:44.500]  We want them to be the same.
[10:44.760 --> 10:45.560]  I like them the same.
[10:45.660 --> 10:46.760]  I like his piss eyes.
[10:47.260 --> 10:49.420]  Yeah. What if one of them was blacked out entirely, though?
[10:49.440 --> 10:50.540]  How would that look?
[10:50.760 --> 10:51.740]  Oh, blacked out.
[10:51.840 --> 10:53.060]  OK. All the way.
[10:53.140 --> 10:53.540]  Piss eye.
[10:54.040 --> 10:54.240]  Yeah.
[10:56.360 --> 10:57.000]  Oh, wow.
[10:58.020 --> 11:00.080]  That I don't kind of like that.
[11:00.220 --> 11:01.320]  I'm not in charge of eyes.
[11:01.440 --> 11:02.380]  I just I just want to see.
[11:02.500 --> 11:02.740]  Yeah.
[11:02.740 --> 11:06.840]  Oh, I like I like the the golden eyes.
[11:07.040 --> 11:07.440]  Let's do it.
[11:07.520 --> 11:08.180]  OK, let's go.
[11:08.280 --> 11:09.220]  Go nice. Yeah.
[11:09.760 --> 11:10.720]  Hey, Eric, back to you.
[11:10.780 --> 11:11.980]  You're in control of brows now.
[11:12.060 --> 11:12.900]  How do we how we feel?
[11:13.380 --> 11:14.480]  Go all the way up.
[11:15.560 --> 11:16.640]  And go all the way down.
[11:19.300 --> 11:20.840]  No, no, not no.
[11:21.280 --> 11:21.980]  I'm not sure.
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.720]  Gavin, was I unclear all the way up, all the way up and down on the same slider?
[11:26.800 --> 11:27.540]  I knew what you meant.
[11:27.660 --> 11:28.040]  Got it.
[11:28.260 --> 11:28.620]  Thank you.
[11:28.860 --> 11:29.660]  Appreciate it.
[11:29.960 --> 11:30.420]  Thanks, man.
[11:30.800 --> 11:33.260]  Yeah, go go up to 100 percent.
[11:33.300 --> 11:33.540]  OK.
[11:36.140 --> 11:37.260]  Go to the next one.
[11:37.700 --> 11:39.820]  OK, go all the way up to 100 percent.
[11:40.760 --> 11:41.160]  Got it.
[11:41.260 --> 11:41.860]  Oh, there we go.
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.020]  That's what I'm looking for.
[11:43.100 --> 11:45.600]  We want to really separate the brows from the eyes.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.580]  Brow spread up to 100 percent.
[11:47.680 --> 11:48.340]  We want to see.
[11:49.180 --> 11:50.080]  But here's the thing.
[11:50.160 --> 11:52.740]  Now go to negative 100 percent because I might want to A.D.
[11:52.740 --> 11:53.180]  this guy.
[11:53.600 --> 11:54.300]  Oh, yeah, there we go.
[11:54.420 --> 11:57.100]  Yeah, we're going to we're going to Anthony Davis unibrow this guy.
[11:57.640 --> 11:58.400]  Oh, I like it.
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.260]  Did he go to Dallas, too, or what?
[12:00.480 --> 12:02.620]  Yeah, it's squashed his little brow depth root as well.
[12:02.980 --> 12:03.560]  All the way up.
[12:04.180 --> 12:05.820]  Good. Yeah, I mean, we don't even have to.
[12:05.880 --> 12:09.060]  Honestly, we don't have to bother going one negative 100 percent.
[12:09.160 --> 12:09.620]  We're good there.
[12:10.040 --> 12:11.560]  He's got like a cling on forehead.
[12:11.680 --> 12:12.540]  Yeah, all the way up.
[12:12.860 --> 12:14.320]  Oh, there. Oh, see now.
[12:14.400 --> 12:15.220]  See, I don't like that.
[12:15.320 --> 12:17.860]  What I do like is that that's severe.
[12:17.940 --> 12:18.900]  OK, severe.
[12:19.580 --> 12:21.880]  I want his eyebrows to match his eyes.
[12:21.960 --> 12:22.720]  Can you do that for me?
[12:26.940 --> 12:28.160]  OK, that's the hair.
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.000]  I think if you took away the godlike features, he still would have gotten
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.140]  his ass kicked in the child.
[12:35.320 --> 12:40.060]  OK, what's the name of that cat that you like in Austin?
[12:40.500 --> 12:41.960]  Oh, it was on the podcast one.
[12:42.020 --> 12:44.560]  Oh, he got like he got like kind of like a tube.
[12:44.640 --> 12:45.840]  He does kind of have to be.
[12:46.040 --> 12:47.260]  I feel like you're kind of making choopy.
[12:47.640 --> 12:48.660]  Let's get him some fries.
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.060]  Yeah, instead of this yellow,
[12:53.280 --> 12:55.300]  just go up to the hue and go all the way left.
[12:57.240 --> 12:58.020]  Yeah, there we go.
[12:58.020 --> 12:58.920]  We're getting there.
[12:59.060 --> 13:02.440]  Yeah, we're trying to get it to blend in and add another layer to
[13:03.580 --> 13:05.300]  his flower on his face, so we're good there.
[13:05.320 --> 13:06.100]  I feel good about that.
[13:08.260 --> 13:10.240]  OK, Geoff, is dad.
[13:10.480 --> 13:11.380]  Am I up for nose?
[13:11.820 --> 13:12.660]  You're up for nose.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.780]  Let's go down to the tiniest nose.
[13:16.720 --> 13:17.780]  OK, hello, baby.
[13:18.100 --> 13:20.460]  Making sure we get those eyes featured.
[13:20.600 --> 13:22.720]  Can we see that nose position all the way down?
[13:22.720 --> 13:24.440]  Yeah, let's go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:24.440 --> 13:25.280]  There you go. We got it.
[13:25.280 --> 13:27.360]  We got to make sure the eyes are good.
[13:27.360 --> 13:29.400]  You want it down or you want it up?
[13:29.600 --> 13:30.440]  I'm kind of into that.
[13:30.580 --> 13:32.500]  Yeah, let's go nose depth.
[13:33.120 --> 13:35.380]  Yeah, wow. He's like kind of got a Michael
[13:35.380 --> 13:37.920]  Michael Jackson toward the end kind of nose.
[13:38.120 --> 13:39.780]  Yeah. Oh, now that's interesting.
[13:40.060 --> 13:41.180]  Oh, I mean, here's the thing.
[13:41.460 --> 13:44.720]  If it is Ian, we might have to stick it all the way out.
[13:44.800 --> 13:46.960]  So if he looks back. Yeah, yeah, that's good.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.940]  All the way out. It's going to have to work, probably. Yeah.
[13:49.560 --> 13:51.340]  Yeah. So let's go ahead and pop that all the way out to 100.
[13:51.500 --> 13:54.480]  Yeah. And then let's see our nose root width.
[13:54.560 --> 13:56.220]  Yeah. How's your nose root today, Gavin?
[13:57.280 --> 14:00.040]  Pretty open. OK, can I see that from the side?
[14:02.700 --> 14:04.220]  Oh, yeah, I think we want to go.
[14:05.540 --> 14:06.680]  Oh, oh, interesting.
[14:06.780 --> 14:08.600]  You want aerodynamic? You want bulky?
[14:08.720 --> 14:10.060]  What do you want? Yeah, it's interesting.
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.720]  Now, let's see that from the front.
[14:13.880 --> 14:15.140]  Yeah, that's good. That's good.
[14:15.160 --> 14:17.480]  That's like an anime. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:17.480 --> 14:18.420]  Let's go all the way to the right.
[14:18.540 --> 14:20.400]  We need to be more like Ian. OK, I think.
[14:20.480 --> 14:22.160]  OK, that's that's about that's a powerful.
[14:22.200 --> 14:23.220]  That's how Roman knows.
[14:23.480 --> 14:24.500]  I'm excited about this one.
[14:24.500 --> 14:25.760]  Nose tip direction.
[14:26.100 --> 14:27.760]  Yeah, I mean, all right.
[14:30.220 --> 14:31.940]  Oh, I think we want to go up.
[14:32.180 --> 14:33.220]  Yeah, I think so.
[14:33.660 --> 14:35.160]  I think we're good there.
[14:35.320 --> 14:36.940]  Full on salute. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:37.260 --> 14:39.340]  I'm good. Thank you, Gavin.
[14:40.380 --> 14:41.940]  Cheeks. OK, let's see the extremes.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.740]  Oh, my God. Oh, all the way up.
[14:46.780 --> 14:48.020]  All the way down. Oh, I like that.
[14:48.140 --> 14:49.700]  Yeah. Yeah, I like that, too.
[14:49.940 --> 14:50.900]  Yeah, that's good.
[14:50.980 --> 14:52.700]  Let's let's suck them in.
[14:53.140 --> 14:53.860]  Suck them in.
[14:54.860 --> 14:56.480]  Oh, oh, that's pretty good.
[14:56.700 --> 14:58.620]  Yeah, but what do they look like all the way out?
[15:01.280 --> 15:02.760]  Yeah, you got like you got filler.
[15:04.040 --> 15:05.040]  Yeah, it does.
[15:05.160 --> 15:05.880]  It looks filler face.
[15:06.380 --> 15:08.400]  Let's see from the side and push him in.
[15:10.760 --> 15:11.840]  Oh, and all the way.
[15:11.920 --> 15:12.360]  Oh, my God.
[15:13.200 --> 15:13.880]  That's great.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.440]  You can see his eyes.
[15:15.560 --> 15:16.640]  I think we might be good there.
[15:16.820 --> 15:18.780]  Honestly. Oh, my God.
[15:19.160 --> 15:20.960]  He's got like Ren and Stimpy eyes now.
[15:20.960 --> 15:22.620]  Oh, he looks like a monster.
[15:22.860 --> 15:24.980]  Now for the jaw, let's let's stick it all out.
[15:26.200 --> 15:27.640]  All 100s? Big it out.
[15:27.760 --> 15:29.740]  Oh, he's got he's jowled out.
[15:29.940 --> 15:30.840]  Yeah. Jowl him out.

[15:35.000 --> 15:36.700]  Yeah. Oh, my God.
[15:36.880 --> 15:37.500]  Oh, my God.
[15:38.260 --> 15:38.920]  Full depth.
[15:40.200 --> 15:41.040]  Full depth. OK.
[15:42.520 --> 15:44.300]  I need to see from the side that we got.
[15:44.540 --> 15:46.240]  He became. Oh, my God.
[15:47.280 --> 15:48.600]  Oh, yeah. Spread it all back.
[15:48.700 --> 15:50.160]  It looks like it's moving really fast.
[15:55.300 --> 15:55.660]  Yeah.
[15:55.840 --> 15:56.020]  Yeah. Yeah.
[15:56.020 --> 15:56.620]  Chin it out.
[15:57.580 --> 15:58.940]  All the way. Oh, yeah.
[15:59.200 --> 15:59.720]  Oh, yeah.
[15:59.820 --> 16:01.540]  All right. Let's see it the other way real quick.
[16:02.780 --> 16:04.180]  Yeah. Bring him down.
[16:05.560 --> 16:06.280]  Oh, interesting.
[16:06.800 --> 16:07.620]  Oh, that's pretty funny.
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.180]  Could you position it up?
[16:09.540 --> 16:11.720]  You know, they say a weak chin is a sign of nobility.
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.320]  Hey, keep it low.
[16:14.860 --> 16:16.260]  Bring it all the way to his lips.
[16:17.280 --> 16:18.300]  Oh. Oh, no.
[16:18.300 --> 16:18.920]  Oh, no.
[16:20.600 --> 16:21.980]  Can I see that from the side?
[16:25.060 --> 16:26.720]  OK, now push all that shit in.
[16:27.060 --> 16:28.720]  It looks like Simon Pegg a little bit.
[16:29.180 --> 16:30.620]  You know, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:31.720 --> 16:32.900]  OK. Oh, damn, I see.
[16:33.100 --> 16:33.640]  Depth. OK.
[16:35.480 --> 16:37.640]  Oh, let's see that from the front.
[16:37.920 --> 16:39.140]  Yeah, there we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:39.160 --> 16:42.600]  It looks like he's got a bit of a vagina coming on the underneath of the chair.
[16:42.880 --> 16:44.360]  Can I see depth all the way out?
[16:44.880 --> 16:46.580]  Yeah, of course.
[16:46.580 --> 16:48.040]  Now, let's see that from the side.
[16:49.000 --> 16:49.860]  I think it's going to be in.
[16:50.080 --> 16:51.320]  I think it has to be.
[16:51.380 --> 16:52.980]  Oh, God. Yeah.
[16:53.620 --> 16:56.180]  His throat is showing through his neck and I love it.
[16:57.020 --> 16:58.560]  This is the hero? OK.
[16:59.980 --> 17:01.140]  All right, Andrew, this is you.
[17:02.340 --> 17:03.600]  Oh, OK. Let's see.
[17:03.640 --> 17:05.560]  Let's look at the fullness of the lips.
[17:06.200 --> 17:10.020]  Oh, I like I personally, I like that.
[17:10.060 --> 17:10.660]  That's me.
[17:14.160 --> 17:15.220]  Bring that in.
[17:15.220 --> 17:17.360]  I kind of got like a butterfly thing going.
[17:17.540 --> 17:18.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:18.820 --> 17:21.240]  He looks like he looks like a who now.
[17:21.580 --> 17:25.520]  Yeah, I could already imagine how he sounds based on his mouth.
[17:26.520 --> 17:28.060]  I've come to save you.
[17:31.480 --> 17:32.540]  Oh, wow.
[17:32.880 --> 17:34.100]  Oh, my God.
[17:35.240 --> 17:35.760]  Ears.
[17:36.700 --> 17:38.340]  Nick, oh, your size.
[17:38.360 --> 17:40.840]  Nick, take us up all the way.
[17:40.980 --> 17:41.480]  Let's see.
[17:42.920 --> 17:43.400]  Wow.
[17:43.400 --> 17:45.260]  All right, let's see the other extreme.
[17:47.120 --> 17:49.880]  I know we started out making an Ian, but I feel like
[17:49.880 --> 17:52.400]  I'm just kind of unintentionally recreated Gavin.
[17:52.740 --> 17:56.420]  I, I think we have to go big here.
[17:56.720 --> 17:57.800]  I think we got to go big.
[17:57.940 --> 17:59.360]  Yeah, full dumbo.
[18:00.020 --> 18:02.160]  All right, let's oh, I want him up.
[18:02.280 --> 18:02.960]  You want him down?
[18:03.960 --> 18:06.280]  Oh, well, surely we've got a lot up top.
[18:06.320 --> 18:07.520]  We got to go low, right?
[18:07.620 --> 18:09.660]  OK, you got to make sure those ears stick out.
[18:09.700 --> 18:10.440]  Make sure people. Yeah.
[18:11.120 --> 18:12.840]  Yeah. Well, we got to be low to the ground.
[18:12.840 --> 18:13.820]  So we can get things you want.
[18:14.320 --> 18:16.280]  Yeah. You want to stick it out?
[18:16.320 --> 18:17.820]  I kind of attack. I want him.
[18:18.260 --> 18:19.800]  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:19.860 --> 18:20.760]  He's taking four.
[18:20.940 --> 18:22.800]  I hear all my ears look like in high school.
[18:25.020 --> 18:26.400]  What is this?
[18:26.860 --> 18:28.100]  So now we can do
[18:30.760 --> 18:31.560]  complexion, OK?
[18:32.360 --> 18:33.120]  Oh, keep it going.
[18:33.340 --> 18:36.060]  Any of these like is his leaf roots are in mud.
[18:36.140 --> 18:36.400]  What do you do?
[18:36.580 --> 18:38.800]  Yeah, I kind of like this one
[18:39.440 --> 18:42.440]  and it get that amount up all the way.
[18:42.440 --> 18:44.400]  And bring the spread all the way down.
[18:44.500 --> 18:45.060]  I just want to see.
[18:45.680 --> 18:47.500]  OK, no, no, no.
[18:47.500 --> 18:49.480]  Spread up, spread up, spread up.
[18:49.640 --> 18:52.600]  And then Lord, and then we can change the color of it.
[18:52.700 --> 18:54.120]  Yeah, but I think it's got to stay brown.
[18:54.140 --> 18:55.920]  So we know that he comes from dirt.
[18:56.060 --> 18:57.440]  He's a mud man. You know what I mean?
[18:57.540 --> 18:58.440]  Oh, he's a mud man.
[18:58.460 --> 19:00.760]  Yeah, like like you can see he's been rolling around in dirt
[19:00.760 --> 19:02.160]  to try to feed like the nutrients.
[19:02.280 --> 19:03.180]  I think it's the first one.
[19:03.360 --> 19:04.640]  I think it's the first one.
[19:04.800 --> 19:07.120]  And I think I feel fine about it.
[19:07.700 --> 19:08.700]  I feel good about it.
[19:08.800 --> 19:09.620]  I think that's good.
[19:11.720 --> 19:12.680]  He wants to do lips.
[19:14.160 --> 19:15.040]  Geoff would be next, wouldn't he?
[19:15.040 --> 19:15.680]  I guess it's him.
[19:15.700 --> 19:17.000]  Yeah, but you can't see him.
[19:17.020 --> 19:17.960]  Can you even see him?
[19:18.320 --> 19:20.360]  Well, if you paint them, you might be able to see him.
[19:20.600 --> 19:21.740]  Oh, can you do the little heart ones?
[19:21.920 --> 19:23.140]  Oh, you can't even see that.
[19:24.180 --> 19:24.700]  You can't.
[19:25.440 --> 19:26.840]  What color do we want the lips?
[19:27.220 --> 19:28.180]  Make them bright red.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.340]  I don't think you'll be able to tell.
[19:29.760 --> 19:32.660]  Well, turn the brightness up and I think you'll be able to see at least a little line.
[19:34.960 --> 19:35.800]  I think you can.
[19:35.920 --> 19:37.780]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you do.
[19:37.960 --> 19:39.000]  Yeah, there you go.
[19:39.620 --> 19:40.620]  He's got like a little tongue.
[19:43.020 --> 19:43.660]  Little tongue.
[19:43.780 --> 19:45.120]  Oh, there you go. Yeah, that makes him look.
[19:45.360 --> 19:47.500]  Yeah, where's the one that looks like a kitty tongue?
[19:47.880 --> 19:48.540]  Go back one more.
[19:48.740 --> 19:49.640]  That one, that one, that one right there.
[19:49.820 --> 19:51.500]  He's got a little quip.
[19:52.380 --> 19:53.400]  Got a little kitty tongue.
[19:55.500 --> 19:56.560]  OK, that's lips.
[19:58.320 --> 19:59.620]  I don't even know who's next.
[19:59.720 --> 20:00.960]  Who wants facial scars, Gavin?
[20:01.360 --> 20:03.220]  So go to that spidery one.
[20:04.480 --> 20:05.180]  Spidery one, OK.
[20:06.200 --> 20:07.240]  I need to see him.
[20:07.760 --> 20:10.100]  How about how about we change the color first?
[20:12.900 --> 20:15.420]  Just turn the brightness up on him.
[20:16.540 --> 20:16.880]  All right.
[20:19.220 --> 20:21.160]  Oh, that's cool, because it looks like a wound.
[20:21.560 --> 20:22.500]  Oh, yeah.
[20:23.480 --> 20:24.920]  Which I guess a scar is.
[20:25.380 --> 20:25.700]  Go to.
[20:29.680 --> 20:30.640]  Go all the way to the.
[20:30.740 --> 20:32.080]  Oh, like X-Men face.
[20:32.460 --> 20:33.060]  Go to the left.
[20:37.940 --> 20:38.360]  Down one.
[20:40.040 --> 20:41.680]  I can't see that really. Down one more.
[20:43.740 --> 20:46.500]  Oh, oh, that gives him a cat face.
[20:46.700 --> 20:47.900]  Yeah, that's like a.
[20:48.060 --> 20:48.920]  Yeah, let's do that.
[20:49.760 --> 20:50.320]  You want that one?
[20:50.420 --> 20:51.180]  Yeah, he's a pretty kitty.
[20:51.820 --> 20:52.620]  He's a pretty kitty.
[20:52.620 --> 20:53.800]  Pretty kitty looking face so far.
[20:54.120 --> 20:54.320]  Yeah.
[20:54.420 --> 20:55.760]  Oh, now I get to pick eyeliner.
[20:56.000 --> 20:56.760]  Oh, hell yeah.
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.560]  Oh, I like it.
[20:59.640 --> 21:00.660]  I kind of like that a lot.
[21:03.480 --> 21:04.860]  Let's do color first.
[21:04.900 --> 21:07.380]  Let's get we don't really have enough green.
[21:08.540 --> 21:09.960]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[21:09.960 --> 21:10.680]  Yeah, we're lagging.
[21:10.760 --> 21:11.980]  Yeah, I think we're like lacking green.
[21:12.220 --> 21:13.580]  We got a lot of other colors.
[21:13.680 --> 21:14.740]  Yeah, you want to green.
[21:14.900 --> 21:18.520]  You want to bring out the natural greens in the kelp in your head.
[21:23.550 --> 21:24.550]  I like that.
[21:24.830 --> 21:25.970]  It's like a fucked up Joker.
[21:26.270 --> 21:27.870]  He does have Joker vision.
[21:28.930 --> 21:29.730]  Oh, whoa.
[21:31.450 --> 21:33.310]  Some of these are crazy.
[21:33.630 --> 21:34.250]  That's creepy.
[21:34.430 --> 21:35.690]  The under eye stuff is creepy.
[21:37.010 --> 21:38.150]  Are you getting weirded out?
[21:39.910 --> 21:41.390]  I'm going to have to dream about this guy.
[21:41.390 --> 21:42.630]  Oh, look at that leaky one.
[21:43.470 --> 21:45.730]  This is my sleep paralysis demon that we're making.
[21:45.830 --> 21:46.410]  Yeah, no kidding.
[21:48.010 --> 21:49.690]  It's a lot of tough choices to pick from.
[21:50.230 --> 21:52.690]  I think that's almost a little too clown like.
[21:54.410 --> 21:56.030]  Yeah, it's probably like a less is more.
[21:56.210 --> 21:56.630]  That's nice.
[21:56.870 --> 21:58.130]  Yeah, I think I'm going with this.
[21:59.910 --> 22:01.290]  Anything else I can do here?
[22:01.450 --> 22:03.770]  I think the secondary color is below the eye.
[22:05.190 --> 22:07.910]  Or maybe the third one looks like it's gray at the moment.
[22:09.650 --> 22:10.250]  Third one.
[22:10.250 --> 22:10.730]  OK.
[22:13.970 --> 22:14.970]  Oh, I see now.
[22:16.370 --> 22:18.530]  That would be let's let's get the brightness up.
[22:20.250 --> 22:21.630]  Make it really pop.
[22:24.910 --> 22:25.710]  Like that.
[22:26.590 --> 22:29.610]  Oh, it looks like you're crying sunshine.
[22:32.550 --> 22:35.010]  OK. Wow.
[22:35.170 --> 22:36.130]  Eyes are good.
[22:36.930 --> 22:37.810]  Nick, makeup.
[22:38.070 --> 22:39.850]  Oh my God. Oh, God.
[22:42.790 --> 22:44.590]  Yeah, where do we go from here?
[22:44.670 --> 22:45.970]  Can you can you show me?
[22:46.070 --> 22:50.650]  Can you go down to columns and go down one more and then left one?
[22:51.650 --> 22:52.470]  Go up one.
[22:54.130 --> 22:57.130]  I just wanted to see if you could see it looks like somebody smacked them
[22:57.130 --> 22:58.110]  forward style.
[22:58.290 --> 23:02.670]  I've yeah, I just wanted to see if like that's like a visible thing,
[23:02.810 --> 23:05.490]  but maybe if you make it like a red handprint, like a red color.
[23:05.750 --> 23:07.950]  Oh, yeah. Go to preset colors and make it red.
[23:08.790 --> 23:11.330]  Wow. You can make it by just doing this.
[23:12.050 --> 23:13.230]  It's like it's been burned.
[23:16.030 --> 23:17.630]  Honestly, can I like that?
[23:17.930 --> 23:18.930]  Can I make a suggestion?
[23:19.690 --> 23:21.650]  Oh, God. Can you try orange?
[23:21.970 --> 23:24.110]  And I want to see if it makes them look like a Garfield.
[23:26.530 --> 23:27.970]  OK, Nick, it's up to you.
[23:28.570 --> 23:29.810]  Yeah, keep it. I like it.
[23:32.110 --> 23:35.430]  God, it's like a Cheeto bag blew up in his face.
[23:35.430 --> 23:39.430]  And maybe he used one of those Cheeto bath bombs.
[23:40.190 --> 23:43.210]  Yeah. Oh, what could the second color be?
[23:44.250 --> 23:45.910]  Yeah, what do you want? Maybe like a teal.
[23:46.030 --> 23:47.030]  What's teal look like?
[23:47.350 --> 23:49.070]  You like this? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:50.190 --> 23:51.410]  I guess it doesn't do anything.
[23:52.670 --> 23:56.050]  That's fine the way it is that he'd look great in an aquarium.
[23:56.330 --> 23:57.910]  Well, now we can pick our role.
[23:58.270 --> 23:59.810]  We can be the arcane scholar.
[24:01.450 --> 24:02.730]  Uh, Fort Auger.
[24:02.890 --> 24:05.530]  Uh-huh. Noble Scion. Vanguard Scout.
[24:05.730 --> 24:07.190]  Does it change what we're wearing?
[24:08.310 --> 24:09.290]  War hero? It doesn't.
[24:09.610 --> 24:12.430]  I don't think it does, but it changes what weapons you start with, I believe.
[24:12.510 --> 24:13.370]  What is war hero?
[24:15.450 --> 24:18.710]  You distinguish yourself on the field of battle fighting a violent uprising
[24:18.710 --> 24:21.130]  and the emperor honored you with a place among the elite.
[24:21.490 --> 24:22.530]  Tall grass spearmen.
[24:22.970 --> 24:26.090]  Some of your scars are less obvious than others, but you wear them all with pride.
[24:26.550 --> 24:29.430]  The emperor values your loyalty, your grit and your martial prowess.
[24:30.910 --> 24:31.790]  Hmm. Hmm.
[24:32.050 --> 24:33.450]  I like I like that.
[24:33.570 --> 24:35.930]  But is he more of like a noble scion?
[24:36.110 --> 24:37.970]  Like when I look at him, I go, this guy might be noble.
[24:38.050 --> 24:38.710]  He might be smart.
[24:40.230 --> 24:43.290]  I think he's a scholar for he's an educated man.
[24:43.410 --> 24:45.690]  Interesting. Interesting. Interesting.
[24:48.330 --> 24:50.370]  I mean, he looks dumb as shit.
[24:50.810 --> 24:51.590]  Yes, he does.
[24:52.150 --> 24:54.470]  What if he's like, what if he's a noble?
[24:54.670 --> 24:56.290]  What if he's an idiot scholar?
[24:57.210 --> 24:58.090]  That's OK.
[24:58.090 --> 25:02.290]  Oh, he just failed forward through his entire life and he keeps getting
[25:02.290 --> 25:06.730]  he keeps let's drop the intelligence to zero, which I didn't know you could do.
[25:06.850 --> 25:08.510]  But he has a lot of resolve.
[25:09.430 --> 25:11.850]  He's like he's persevered through all.
[25:12.050 --> 25:12.610]  You know what I mean?
[25:12.610 --> 25:14.690]  Like exactly how I build my personal character.
[25:15.150 --> 25:17.170]  He's got too much might though, I think.
[25:17.650 --> 25:18.610]  You think he's too strong?
[25:19.050 --> 25:20.050]  I think he's too mighty.
[25:20.490 --> 25:23.150]  I think you have to take some might out, but give him some constitution.
[25:23.730 --> 25:25.170]  Yeah, he's got a lot of constitution.
[25:25.470 --> 25:26.370]  Yeah, I think more constitution.
[25:26.370 --> 25:28.250]  Yeah, I think that's the max we can do.
[25:28.470 --> 25:29.690]  This honestly feels good to me.
[25:30.130 --> 25:31.590]  Yeah. Are we good?
[25:31.710 --> 25:32.670]  Yeah, that's great.
[25:33.110 --> 25:33.710]  Oh, all right.
[25:35.530 --> 25:36.890]  Yeah. Difficulty normal.
[25:37.070 --> 25:40.450]  What kind of what kind of what kind of attacking do you guys want to do?
[25:40.530 --> 25:41.270]  Here are the options.
[25:41.270 --> 25:43.430]  There's like all manner of melee, right?
[25:43.830 --> 25:46.650]  So two handed swords, one handed swords, daggers.
[25:47.190 --> 25:50.030]  Then there's a book you can shoot spells out of.
[25:50.110 --> 25:53.550]  There's a wand you can shoot just wand magic out of, I guess.
[25:53.770 --> 25:54.750]  And there's guns.
[25:55.390 --> 25:57.390]  What? Oh, this guy's got a gun.
[25:57.630 --> 25:59.410]  OK, then I think we're probably OK then.
[26:00.210 --> 26:01.830]  He definitely needs to have guns.
[26:02.990 --> 26:06.590]  Yeah, I don't know if we'll get a gun in what we play.
[26:07.250 --> 26:08.030]  Here we go.
[26:08.250 --> 26:09.870]  You cannot remake your journey of Ian.
[26:11.030 --> 26:12.730]  It's twenty eight thirty one.
[26:12.870 --> 26:14.610]  I've been asleep for twenty eight thirty one. That's me.
[26:15.030 --> 26:16.750]  That's me. Oh, that's you.
[26:16.990 --> 26:18.570]  Eric follows that guy on TikTok.
[26:18.970 --> 26:19.670]  I'm a new creature.
[26:19.790 --> 26:21.410]  I love guys. I'm a creatures guy.
[26:21.530 --> 26:22.930]  You got a creature. Let me know.
[26:22.930 --> 26:24.410]  This is my kind of little creature.
[26:24.730 --> 26:26.530]  All right, Eric, you voice this creature.
[26:26.630 --> 26:27.830]  This is you for the rest of the game now.
[26:27.830 --> 26:30.350]  Let me see. Let me see what's going on with the tree.
[26:30.650 --> 26:33.210]  Oh, let me uh, the mushrooms, everybody.
[26:33.670 --> 26:36.530]  Oh, today the porzingis flower.
[26:36.850 --> 26:40.410]  OK, let me let me just walk right by this thing.
[26:40.610 --> 26:45.590]  Oh, everybody knows the most delicious flowers grow at the highest parts of this tree.
[26:46.110 --> 26:47.590]  I'm going low. Oh, no.
[26:48.270 --> 26:50.750]  Oh, da bird. It's da bird.
[26:50.990 --> 26:52.530]  He's back to get me.
[26:52.530 --> 26:54.250]  But I can't... No.
[26:55.150 --> 26:56.590]  No I can't...
[26:57.930 --> 26:58.470]  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
[27:02.020 --> 27:03.820]  Oh, there's an exploding bowel bun.
[27:05.800 --> 27:07.100]  Well, you're dead.
[27:07.720 --> 27:07.980]  Ugh.
[27:10.840 --> 27:12.380]  Eric's dead for the rest of the video.
[27:13.360 --> 27:14.540]  He's just gone.
[27:20.730 --> 27:23.150]  Eric, you should start a video game critter TikTok.
[27:24.230 --> 27:25.410]  It's not a bad idea.
[27:25.590 --> 27:26.170]  It's pretty good.
[27:27.950 --> 27:29.250]  Oh no, does he come back?
[27:29.590 --> 27:29.950]  Oh yeah.
[27:30.030 --> 27:30.890]  I'm like, what's up bud?
[27:31.230 --> 27:31.670]  What happened?
[27:31.870 --> 27:32.650]  Oh no.
[27:33.150 --> 27:33.410]  Uh oh.
[27:33.550 --> 27:35.550]  I'm feeling better than ever guys.
[27:35.810 --> 27:38.890]  I've got to tell you, something's weird happening to me.
[27:39.110 --> 27:40.910]  It's making me strong though.
[27:41.190 --> 27:42.390]  I'm feeling good.
[27:42.510 --> 27:42.970]  Uh oh.
[27:43.370 --> 27:44.190]  Uh oh.
[27:44.450 --> 27:45.370]  Guys, I'm back.
[27:45.430 --> 27:46.790]  Hey, it's your boy.
[27:47.350 --> 27:48.010]  What's going on?
[27:48.070 --> 27:50.390]  Da Banana Man is back with you.
[27:50.990 --> 27:53.470]  Come on and hang out with Da Banana Man.
[27:57.470 --> 28:01.230]  I'm surprised his personality lasted through that transition.
[28:01.710 --> 28:03.730]  Well, it made the Banana Man stronger.
[28:05.790 --> 28:09.590]  So this all happened because the Banana Man stepped on something?
[28:10.550 --> 28:11.110]  Yes.
[28:11.510 --> 28:12.050]  Oh no.
[28:12.070 --> 28:16.990]  That's where it all went wrong in this universe, when that creature stepped on the exploding
[28:16.990 --> 28:17.630]  bowel thing.
[28:17.630 --> 28:19.910]  On the cordyceps spores.
[28:20.690 --> 28:22.830]  The hopes of an empire.
[28:23.610 --> 28:25.150]  Turns everyone into MILFs.
[28:29.590 --> 28:30.630]  Oh man.
[28:30.730 --> 28:32.290]  Oh man, what an outbreak.
[28:32.750 --> 28:37.650]  We gotta do something about this, fellas.
[28:38.230 --> 28:39.530]  Guys, guys, guys.
[28:39.670 --> 28:41.570]  We gotta stop this, I guess.
[28:48.640 --> 28:49.820]  This dramatic music.
[28:50.840 --> 28:51.240]  It is.
[28:51.360 --> 28:51.640]  Yeah.
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.280]  It shot the boat.
[28:53.640 --> 28:56.040]  I thought my game froze for a second at this point.
[28:59.140 --> 29:00.540]  That was for dramatic effect.
[29:02.860 --> 29:06.260]  I'll be honest, we're playing the game a lot sooner than I was when I started this.
[29:06.560 --> 29:08.060]  It took me a lot longer to make my guy.
[29:08.520 --> 29:09.500]  Yeah, I agree.
[29:09.640 --> 29:11.300]  I spent way too long on the character creator.
[29:11.920 --> 29:14.460]  And then I got kind of tired of making my guy, and I had to take a break.
[29:17.360 --> 29:18.000]  There goes Eric.
[29:19.440 --> 29:21.760]  When are we checking in on the banana man again?
[29:21.840 --> 29:22.560]  What's he up to?
[29:23.500 --> 29:25.040]  How did he become the banana man?
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.060]  He was after some bananas.
[29:27.240 --> 29:27.960]  He's looking for the bananas.
[29:27.960 --> 29:29.340]  He's looking for some bananas.
[29:29.940 --> 29:34.340]  The banana man, you know, he took a tumble, but he's stronger than ever.
[29:34.700 --> 29:35.640]  I assume.
[29:37.600 --> 29:39.340]  Does this guy know the banana man?
[29:39.940 --> 29:40.780]  We'll find out.
[29:40.920 --> 29:41.640]  We'll go talk to him.
[29:41.800 --> 29:44.860]  Do you think that guy is our husband or our wife?
[29:48.800 --> 29:51.240]  Is this where Anna and Elsa's parents wound up?
[29:52.340 --> 29:55.000]  His reaction to seeing us would be fair.
[29:56.220 --> 29:57.360]  What the fuck?
[29:59.840 --> 30:02.160]  You're alive, if that's what we want to call it.
[30:03.480 --> 30:05.440]  If that happened to you in the wreck.
[30:07.860 --> 30:09.520]  Look at our constitution.
[30:09.800 --> 30:11.420]  Look at our constitution, baby.
[30:12.560 --> 30:13.900]  That's what I'm saying.
[30:14.480 --> 30:16.320]  It'll take more than a shipwreck to build.
[30:18.240 --> 30:20.340]  His head looks like a shipwreck.
[30:23.400 --> 30:24.800]  What are we thinking?
[30:26.280 --> 30:27.340]  Nick, you're the voice.
[30:28.040 --> 30:29.820]  Let's start with names. Who are you?
[30:30.520 --> 30:34.220]  The name's Garak, sir. Quarter gunner. Third Adirin fleet.
[30:38.320 --> 30:39.300]  Grunt affirmatively.
[30:41.900 --> 30:42.840]  That's pretty good.
[30:43.100 --> 30:45.000]  We've got an outpost on this island, but...
[30:45.840 --> 30:46.580]  Oh no!
[30:47.020 --> 30:48.060]  Zero of three!
[30:48.600 --> 30:49.760]  Can you do anything on ship?
[30:50.100 --> 30:51.540]  Can you choose the zero?
[30:52.820 --> 30:53.020]  No.
[30:53.220 --> 30:53.800]  Aw, damn.
[30:54.400 --> 30:57.300]  Yeah, you gotta go with but what. The soldiers can help us.
[30:58.420 --> 31:00.220]  We're dumb as rocks, dude.
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.080]  Oh my god.
[31:17.660 --> 31:18.220]  Ooh.
[31:18.280 --> 31:20.240]  Do you think someone betrayed us?
[31:20.480 --> 31:20.680]  Yeah.
[31:24.840 --> 31:26.920]  But still, someone fired those cannons.
[31:27.920 --> 31:32.260]  Who playing this game would regularly not use their unique dialogue options?
[31:38.300 --> 31:39.400]  Hold on.
[31:39.620 --> 31:42.080]  Now hang on just a second.
[31:42.280 --> 31:44.220]  What about the attackers?
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.360]  Regroup? There's two of us.
[31:53.220 --> 31:54.020]  Fall back!
[31:59.860 --> 32:01.980]  We're currently regrouped.
[32:02.080 --> 32:03.240]  Sir, it's just us.
[32:03.300 --> 32:04.220]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:04.540 --> 32:06.100]  Dude, you gotta tell them to follow you.
[32:06.420 --> 32:09.880]  You just shipwrecked. You just woke up.
[32:10.160 --> 32:12.040]  Yeah, hey man. I'll lead the way.
[32:13.620 --> 32:15.540]  Listen, you just told me everything. Follow me.
[32:16.600 --> 32:18.280]  I'm informed now. Let's go.
[32:19.080 --> 32:20.120]  Find a weapon.
[32:21.160 --> 32:21.600]  Sword.
[32:21.940 --> 32:22.100]  Okay.
[32:22.520 --> 32:25.920]  That's good. Now, where do we trade this dagger for guns?
[32:26.980 --> 32:29.360]  Do we wanna just be fists for now, or what do we wanna...
[32:29.360 --> 32:30.700]  Oh, you're gonna go full unarmed?
[32:31.220 --> 32:35.280]  I think you gotta have the dagger. I think you have, like, you never know what sneakier...
[32:35.280 --> 32:36.660]  What if the banana man comes for you?
[32:37.820 --> 32:39.260]  That's true. The banana man could come.
[32:39.280 --> 32:41.920]  He could come at any time. And everyone ran away from him.
[32:42.460 --> 32:44.620]  That guy made it all the way to there and died.
[32:44.620 --> 32:47.660]  So, we got a dagger.
[32:50.620 --> 32:52.040]  Left-handed or right-handed?
[32:52.340 --> 32:54.180]  Oh, hey, for Geoff, left-handed.
[32:54.440 --> 32:54.760]  Lefty.
[32:54.760 --> 32:58.400]  Oh, thank you. I tend to do my stabbing with the right hand, but I like it.
[32:59.740 --> 33:01.800]  What else we got? We got graves.
[33:02.240 --> 33:03.000]  Ooh, let's dig them up.
[33:03.400 --> 33:03.840]  Take the ore.
[33:05.140 --> 33:05.740]  Or what?
[33:07.240 --> 33:08.480]  Oh, the banana man!
[33:12.780 --> 33:15.620]  He's been here. I can tell.
[33:17.200 --> 33:18.640]  Let's see if I can just punch this.
[33:20.200 --> 33:20.420]  No.
[33:20.580 --> 33:22.060]  Oh, you're doing it. You're doing it. Keep going.
[33:22.400 --> 33:23.060]  There you go.
[33:25.680 --> 33:29.140]  That other guy's like, this guy just came out of the water and punched through a wall.
[33:30.220 --> 33:33.560]  He said, follow me and started stabbing wood?
[33:33.760 --> 33:35.480]  He checked out the graves first.
[33:35.700 --> 33:37.520]  Screaming about a banana man?
[33:37.520 --> 33:39.720]  Are you...
[33:39.720 --> 33:41.920]  You definitely hit your face on that.
[33:42.100 --> 33:42.720]  Go behind the waterfall.
[33:43.280 --> 33:44.140]  Oh, behind the waterfall?
[33:46.120 --> 33:46.520]  Wow!
[33:47.080 --> 33:48.180]  Nothing here, okay.
[33:48.320 --> 33:48.520]  Nothing.
[33:48.840 --> 33:50.140]  The backside of water.
[33:50.960 --> 33:51.280]  Okay.
[33:51.620 --> 33:53.340]  A lot of stuff hidden in waterfalls in this game.
[33:54.080 --> 33:54.600]  Are you serious?
[33:55.020 --> 33:55.200]  Yeah.
[33:55.880 --> 33:57.840]  Oh, I've checked like three and I didn't find anything.
[33:58.200 --> 34:00.060]  See, I have the same experience, Gavin.
[34:00.260 --> 34:02.180]  Yeah, I already looked behind that one and saw it all.
[34:02.340 --> 34:05.020]  This isn't the first time I've heard Geoff talk about these waterfalls.
[34:05.160 --> 34:05.860]  Go behind the waterfall.
[34:06.060 --> 34:06.460]  I'm aware.
[34:06.460 --> 34:06.960]  This one?
[34:07.280 --> 34:07.380]  Yeah.
[34:09.360 --> 34:10.100]  Nothing there.
[34:10.620 --> 34:11.140]  Oh!
[34:11.300 --> 34:11.560]  Oh!
[34:12.620 --> 34:13.800]  Get back!
[34:13.940 --> 34:14.220]  Get back!
[34:14.760 --> 34:16.480]  You need to use health, dude.
[34:16.900 --> 34:17.460]  Your bow!
[34:17.600 --> 34:17.920]  There you go.
[34:18.380 --> 34:18.860]  That was close.
[34:20.380 --> 34:21.260]  Just power attack.
[34:21.380 --> 34:22.740]  Charge that stabba.
[34:22.860 --> 34:23.500]  Charging it!
[34:24.020 --> 34:24.160]  Ha!
[34:24.420 --> 34:25.200]  Oh shit!
[34:25.560 --> 34:25.860]  Hi-ya!
[34:26.040 --> 34:26.280]  Oh!
[34:27.320 --> 34:28.260]  There you go!
[34:28.520 --> 34:29.200]  There you go.
[34:29.320 --> 34:29.780]  Uppercut!
[34:30.760 --> 34:31.280]  Uppercut!
[34:32.040 --> 34:33.320]  Oh my god!
[34:33.420 --> 34:33.960]  Holy shit!
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.360]  I sent him so far!
[34:35.360 --> 34:36.460]  That was awesome!
[34:38.140 --> 34:38.940]  Holy shit!
[34:39.180 --> 34:40.560]  Where's the waterfall thing, Geoff?
[34:40.560 --> 34:41.680]  There's nothing behind that waterfall.
[34:42.180 --> 34:42.500]  No!
[34:42.840 --> 34:43.600]  Watch your knife off to find the right one.
[34:43.980 --> 34:44.820]  Watch your knife off, dude.
[34:44.840 --> 34:45.140]  It's bloody.
[34:45.760 --> 34:45.960]  Yeah.
[34:46.180 --> 34:46.720]  Oh, there you go.
[34:47.080 --> 34:47.840]  You got it, you got it.
[34:48.160 --> 34:49.060]  Stabbed the blood off.
[34:49.720 --> 34:50.460]  Yeah, you did.
[34:51.400 --> 34:51.600]  Ah!
[34:51.620 --> 34:52.420]  Oh, now it's bloody again.
[34:52.980 --> 34:53.020]  Oh!
[34:53.760 --> 34:55.920]  You got some shit over there to pick up.
[34:56.280 --> 34:56.520]  Where?
[34:56.860 --> 34:57.320]  Right there.
[34:57.380 --> 34:57.600]  Oh!
[34:58.100 --> 34:58.680]  Right there.
[34:59.320 --> 35:00.940]  Careful, those might turn you into the banana man.
[35:00.980 --> 35:01.700]  You need to look out.
[35:01.720 --> 35:02.460]  Oh shit!
[35:02.580 --> 35:03.100]  That's a great point.
[35:03.100 --> 35:05.100]  What'd he say?
[35:06.060 --> 35:06.380]  Oh!
[35:06.380 --> 35:06.940]  Triple R!
[35:07.180 --> 35:08.220]  Oh yeah, triple R.
[35:10.480 --> 35:11.240]  There's another one.
[35:11.280 --> 35:12.040]  I ain't falling for this.
[35:12.140 --> 35:12.900]  Give me the health potion.
[35:13.660 --> 35:14.100]  Oh, nice!
[35:15.260 --> 35:16.240]  Look how smart you are.
[35:16.320 --> 35:17.120]  This one, Geoff?
[35:17.260 --> 35:17.820]  You think this one?
[35:18.020 --> 35:18.040]  Yeah.
[35:18.200 --> 35:19.540]  Hey, check out this waterfall, dude.
[35:19.680 --> 35:20.640]  There's gotta be something back here.
[35:20.640 --> 35:21.440]  This one looks promising.
[35:22.140 --> 35:22.600]  Not that one.
[35:22.660 --> 35:23.680]  Nothing behind any of these.
[35:23.860 --> 35:24.920]  I think it's a different one.
[35:25.040 --> 35:26.480]  I think it's a different one.
[35:26.520 --> 35:26.980]  I think you're right.
[35:27.060 --> 35:27.660]  I think it's a different one.
[35:27.700 --> 35:28.240]  Can I crawl in here?
[35:28.420 --> 35:28.740]  Oh!
[35:28.900 --> 35:29.480]  Oh, almost.
[35:30.460 --> 35:31.540]  That would be the end of the journey.
[35:31.540 --> 35:32.140]  How do you crawl in there?
[35:32.220 --> 35:32.660]  Oh, wait.
[35:32.860 --> 35:33.740]  Go back.
[35:34.540 --> 35:34.640]  Where?
[35:34.900 --> 35:35.220]  Turn around to the right.
[35:35.840 --> 35:37.260]  Climb up there to the right.
[35:37.960 --> 35:38.120]  How?
[35:38.120 --> 35:39.160]  First off, get your bush right there.
[35:39.200 --> 35:39.800]  Now jump up there.
[35:40.680 --> 35:40.980]  How?
[35:41.120 --> 35:42.100]  Can you jump up there?
[35:42.460 --> 35:42.900]  Can you jump?
[35:42.920 --> 35:43.660]  I don't think so.
[35:43.740 --> 35:44.900]  I don't think I can jump high enough.
[35:45.240 --> 35:46.100]  Jump on Garrick.
[35:46.200 --> 35:46.360]  Maybe?
[35:47.460 --> 35:48.920]  No, if you can't jump on that one, you probably can't.
[35:48.920 --> 35:49.860]  Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[35:50.020 --> 35:50.300]  Oh, okay.
[35:50.300 --> 35:51.660]  Go behind that waterfall.
[35:53.780 --> 35:54.260]  Fourth time.
[35:54.660 --> 35:54.980]  Geoff!
[35:55.860 --> 35:56.980]  I didn't find this!
[35:57.000 --> 35:57.820]  I missed this!
[35:58.240 --> 35:58.780]  I suck!
[35:58.780 --> 36:00.100]  Because you don't go behind waterfalls!
[36:00.100 --> 36:00.880]  I told you!
[36:01.020 --> 36:01.460]  I can't go on.
[36:01.660 --> 36:02.520]  I hear the cries.
[36:02.800 --> 36:04.300]  Tell the banana man I'm sorry.
[36:05.840 --> 36:09.500]  You guys, if you let one waterfall tell you no, you're fucked.
[36:09.560 --> 36:10.860]  I let three tell me no.
[36:11.040 --> 36:11.340]  Yeah.
[36:11.660 --> 36:12.320]  Oh my god.
[36:12.380 --> 36:14.600]  Wait, can you equip the other dagger?
[36:15.400 --> 36:17.900]  Oh yeah, we can dual-wield daggers if we want.
[36:18.000 --> 36:18.700]  Yeah, we want.
[36:18.920 --> 36:19.100]  Bah!
[36:19.200 --> 36:19.600]  Bah!
[36:19.680 --> 36:19.860]  Bah!
[36:20.060 --> 36:21.280]  Yeah, we want, we want.
[36:21.660 --> 36:22.540]  That's pretty cool.
[36:23.780 --> 36:24.860]  That's pretty cool.
[36:25.640 --> 36:29.540]  This is so, it's so dangerous looking.
[36:31.960 --> 36:35.520]  Running around with them out in front of you looks so dangerous.
[36:35.840 --> 36:37.880]  Could you jab them both at the same time?
[36:38.700 --> 36:39.420]  Uh, no.
[36:39.720 --> 36:40.740]  There might be some shit up there.
[36:41.300 --> 36:42.020]  Yeah, yeah, go up here.
[36:42.720 --> 36:43.400]  Around the corner.
[36:44.820 --> 36:45.160]  Nope.
[36:45.320 --> 36:46.600]  That might have been how I got to the waterfall.
[36:46.760 --> 36:48.120]  Yeah, that's probably how you got there.
[36:48.340 --> 36:49.180]  I just missed that.
[36:49.340 --> 36:49.560]  Damn.
[36:49.900 --> 36:51.180]  I'm gonna restart my game now.
[36:51.580 --> 36:52.380]  Oh boy!
[36:52.500 --> 36:53.020]  Look to the left.
[36:53.020 --> 36:54.080]  Oh wow!
[36:55.240 --> 36:55.680]  It's a note.
[36:57.080 --> 36:58.120]  Things went bad.
[36:59.540 --> 37:02.800]  That is, uh, by the way, that's how I found my first gun was behind a waterfall.
[37:03.100 --> 37:03.780]  So you might be able to get it.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.940]  Oh really?
[37:06.180 --> 37:07.840]  How many hours in when you found a gun?
[37:09.140 --> 37:11.200]  I was probably like 16.
[37:11.580 --> 37:12.200]  Oh wow.
[37:12.400 --> 37:12.560]  Shit.
[37:12.720 --> 37:13.780]  Less than three.
[37:14.460 --> 37:14.880]  Wow!
[37:15.320 --> 37:15.740]  Insane.
[37:16.020 --> 37:16.860]  There's a real difference.
[37:18.060 --> 37:18.940]  What is this?
[37:19.940 --> 37:23.600]  Maybe we should always play the game as five of us so we never miss anything.
[37:27.720 --> 37:28.160]  Ah!
[37:29.000 --> 37:29.440]  Voices.
[37:29.720 --> 37:31.480]  Yeah, you gotta deal with your brain for a minute.
[37:32.700 --> 37:34.820]  I'm so sick of dealing with my brain!
[37:35.100 --> 37:35.600]  I know.
[37:35.820 --> 37:36.260]  Is that a shield?
[37:37.260 --> 37:38.820]  And a roasted chicken?
[37:39.080 --> 37:39.960]  Oh my god.
[37:40.220 --> 37:40.800]  What a day.
[37:40.820 --> 37:41.760]  And a storage key.
[37:41.980 --> 37:42.660]  You can go in the storage room.
[37:42.660 --> 37:43.820]  You can go in that storage room.
[37:44.440 --> 37:47.080]  You can have two different loadouts.
[37:47.080 --> 37:48.940]  Oh cool!
[37:49.240 --> 37:50.580]  So we could go...
[37:50.580 --> 37:50.800]  Shield?
[37:50.840 --> 37:51.160]  Yes.
[37:51.580 --> 37:52.300]  Double daggers.
[37:52.620 --> 37:54.180]  Shield, fist, and then double daggers.
[37:54.260 --> 37:54.720]  I think that's good.
[37:54.840 --> 37:57.040]  I think you have to go back and open the storage locker.
[37:57.400 --> 37:58.240]  Or the storage room.
[37:58.400 --> 37:58.540]  Right?
[37:59.240 --> 37:59.520]  Yeah.
[38:00.720 --> 38:01.420]  First off, grab that.
[38:01.680 --> 38:02.180]  Let's explore a little bit.
[38:02.220 --> 38:02.780]  What were you saying, Gavin?
[38:03.620 --> 38:07.440]  I think one loadout should be two swords and the other should be a shield and a chicken.
[38:08.720 --> 38:09.820]  Can you hold the chicken?
[38:10.260 --> 38:10.940]  I don't think so.
[38:12.040 --> 38:13.100]  Would be good though.
[38:13.600 --> 38:14.600]  Go back to that storage room.
[38:14.700 --> 38:15.420]  Yeah, there you go.
[38:15.560 --> 38:16.700]  You wanna go through there to the left.
[38:17.080 --> 38:18.520]  Yeah, you wanna go in here.
[38:18.720 --> 38:19.280]  It's here?
[38:20.160 --> 38:20.400]  Yep.
[38:21.260 --> 38:23.660]  Well, we gotta go around, we gotta...
[38:23.660 --> 38:23.960]  Stew!
[38:24.580 --> 38:25.280]  Delicious stew.
[38:25.380 --> 38:25.620]  I need it.
[38:25.800 --> 38:26.880]  That's surely still good.
[38:27.980 --> 38:29.000]  You should switch your loadout.
[38:30.200 --> 38:31.960]  You should switch your loadout.
[38:34.480 --> 38:35.080]  Apple.
[38:37.780 --> 38:38.380]  Apple.
[38:39.300 --> 38:40.840]  Apple man gets apples.
[38:42.620 --> 38:43.480]  Steadman's log.
[38:45.480 --> 38:46.080]  Stardate.
[38:46.080 --> 38:46.580]  Uh-oh.
[38:46.720 --> 38:47.380]  I like this guy.
[38:47.540 --> 38:47.880]  Whoa!
[38:49.180 --> 38:49.640]  Pretty cool.
[38:49.760 --> 38:50.640]  I'm gonna start doing that to paintings.
[38:51.260 --> 38:51.620]  I like it.
[38:51.720 --> 38:54.320]  Is it 2381 or 2831 here?
[38:54.620 --> 38:54.980]  2831.
[38:55.400 --> 38:58.400]  So, that room at the beginning wasn't where you used the key?
[38:58.500 --> 38:58.940]  Or it was?
[38:59.520 --> 39:01.620]  We don't have the key yet, is the problem.
[39:01.800 --> 39:02.880]  I thought you picked up a key.
[39:03.540 --> 39:04.280]  Oh, I did.
[39:04.400 --> 39:04.840]  I don't...
[39:04.840 --> 39:04.940]  Good call.
[39:05.080 --> 39:07.620]  I just kept saying it.
[39:07.800 --> 39:08.040]  Gavin!
[39:08.400 --> 39:08.520]  Good call.
[39:08.700 --> 39:08.880]  Gavin!
[39:09.540 --> 39:10.080]  Good call.
[39:10.420 --> 39:11.380]  Oh, we got a breastplate.
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.240]  One size fits all.
[39:14.240 --> 39:16.460]  I just...
[39:17.360 --> 39:18.080]  Yeah, you did.
[39:19.120 --> 39:20.300]  He did say it.
[39:20.360 --> 39:21.260]  I was wrapped up.
[39:21.860 --> 39:23.080]  And I wanna fight that guy.
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.300]  Oh, there's money to the right of that, too.
[39:25.020 --> 39:25.580]  There was something else up there.
[39:25.580 --> 39:26.200]  Money to the...
[39:26.200 --> 39:27.000]  Oh, nice.
[39:27.720 --> 39:31.200]  We definitely need to play these games with Andrew because he doesn't get anything.
[39:31.740 --> 39:32.140]  Yeah.
[39:32.960 --> 39:33.360]  Wow.
[39:33.780 --> 39:34.760]  Let's go through here.
[39:34.900 --> 39:36.580]  Yeah, he's probably like, I didn't see any waterfalls.
[39:37.880 --> 39:40.520]  There actually aren't even one waterfall in the game.
[39:41.400 --> 39:43.040]  Well, this is a 10-eye playthrough.
[39:44.280 --> 39:45.360]  It is, it's true.
[39:46.920 --> 39:49.640]  And I have my contacts in, so I can see really good.
[39:51.540 --> 39:51.840]  Whoa!
[39:52.140 --> 39:52.840]  Oh, no.
[39:53.220 --> 39:53.700]  Oh, no.
[39:54.080 --> 39:54.640]  Look out, look out.
[39:55.360 --> 39:56.040]  Oh, bring it.
[39:56.120 --> 39:56.740]  No, no, no, no, no.
[39:56.900 --> 39:57.240]  Look out!
[39:57.960 --> 39:59.500]  He's gotta have more range than you, dude.
[39:59.620 --> 40:00.240]  Oh, shit.
[40:00.860 --> 40:02.580]  Yeah, but I got two knives and he doesn't.
[40:02.600 --> 40:03.520]  You gotta go around him, you gotta go around him.
[40:04.160 --> 40:04.960]  I've been to the convoy.
[40:04.980 --> 40:05.580]  Goin' around, goin' around.
[40:05.940 --> 40:06.700]  Swap and load out.
[40:09.100 --> 40:09.400]  Punch.
[40:09.560 --> 40:10.680]  You punched him in the...
[40:10.680 --> 40:11.020]  Punch.
[40:11.020 --> 40:12.020]  He's punching a fuckin'...
[40:12.900 --> 40:12.980]  Punch!
[40:13.100 --> 40:14.380]  Armored lizard man.
[40:15.360 --> 40:16.160]  Fuckin' die!
[40:16.520 --> 40:17.940]  He's getting stunned, though.
[40:18.240 --> 40:19.320]  He's getting real stunned up.
[40:19.740 --> 40:19.880]  Yep.
[40:20.160 --> 40:20.800]  There you go, get him!
[40:20.840 --> 40:22.280]  Oh, I uppercutted his shield down.
[40:23.740 --> 40:25.160]  Get him! Come on, buddy!
[40:27.460 --> 40:27.920]  Wow.
[40:30.880 --> 40:32.280]  Oh, shit, there's more of them.
[40:32.580 --> 40:33.420]  Did he drop his lance?
[40:34.640 --> 40:37.620]  Oh, you uppercutted that dude hardcore, dude.
[40:37.700 --> 40:39.360]  That was like a Tyson uppercut.
[40:39.940 --> 40:41.140]  Quick, switch your weapons!
[40:41.380 --> 40:42.160]  Your health is low!
[40:42.640 --> 40:43.200]  Split him up!
[40:44.100 --> 40:44.900]  Drinkin', drinkin'!
[40:44.900 --> 40:45.320]  Don't!
[40:45.460 --> 40:45.940]  Let me drink!
[40:46.080 --> 40:47.780]  Did you throw a potion at him?
[40:50.720 --> 40:51.520]  Save Garrick!
[40:52.160 --> 40:52.880]  Get him!
[40:53.020 --> 40:57.180]  These lizards were just hangin' out and you came through and you just tore them apart.
[40:57.860 --> 40:58.020]  Yeah.
[40:58.480 --> 40:59.200]  He just came in.
[41:00.920 --> 41:01.720]  Double windmilling.
[41:01.880 --> 41:02.300]  Two knives.
[41:02.320 --> 41:03.280]  Oh, look out! More lizards!
[41:03.960 --> 41:04.360]  Fuck.
[41:04.380 --> 41:04.580]  Wow.
[41:04.720 --> 41:05.940]  Okay, we're goin' back to the shield.
[41:06.180 --> 41:06.560]  Oh, no.
[41:07.100 --> 41:09.100]  This was not the ideal loadout for this.
[41:10.180 --> 41:11.220]  This is not...
[41:11.220 --> 41:12.480]  This does not work.
[41:12.720 --> 41:13.940]  This is not right.
[41:14.000 --> 41:14.540]  I disagree.
[41:14.680 --> 41:15.700]  I'm blockin' his hits.
[41:15.820 --> 41:16.500]  It's great.
[41:16.620 --> 41:19.120]  I mean, it sounds like at this point, Geoff had an AK-47 already.
[41:19.540 --> 41:19.780]  Yeah, right?
[41:20.580 --> 41:21.440]  I just had a pistol.
[41:21.900 --> 41:22.220]  Oh, okay.
[41:23.000 --> 41:23.760]  I don't know if I had it here.
[41:23.760 --> 41:24.520]  Oh, he doesn't like that!
[41:24.580 --> 41:25.340]  He doesn't like that!
[41:26.160 --> 41:26.400]  Oh!
[41:27.860 --> 41:29.720]  I'm gonna let my stamina return.
[41:29.920 --> 41:30.640]  Okay, you're gonna die.
[41:32.440 --> 41:33.220]  Doesn't like that!
[41:33.600 --> 41:37.040]  Man, for someone without a chin, you're sure doin' a shitload of damage to chins right now.
[41:39.980 --> 41:41.300]  Oh, he almost got it full!
[41:42.380 --> 41:45.520]  Oh, he's stunned. Now you're fucked.
[41:45.640 --> 41:45.980]  Now you're fucked.
[41:45.980 --> 41:46.460]  Oh, yeah, get him!
[41:46.840 --> 41:48.220]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop!
[41:48.360 --> 41:49.020]  Come on!
[41:49.420 --> 41:49.780]  Nice!
[41:50.380 --> 41:50.880]  Get him!
[41:50.980 --> 41:51.340]  That's so good.
[41:53.040 --> 41:53.960]  I got you, buddy!
[41:54.140 --> 41:54.940]  Oh, my God.
[41:55.180 --> 41:57.820]  That would've been so funny if you just walked over and one-punched him.
[41:59.820 --> 42:00.760]  Dude, that was crazy.
[42:00.780 --> 42:02.520]  The combat in this is cool.
[42:02.940 --> 42:08.600]  I like that you're going through this as the, like, Pillars of Eternity version of a UFC fighter or something.
[42:10.180 --> 42:11.700]  I'm the Ice Man, Chuck Liddell.
[42:13.980 --> 42:15.480]  There was nothing back there.
[42:15.640 --> 42:16.820]  Yeah, okay.
[42:17.600 --> 42:19.880]  You see some waterfalls that we missed or what?
[42:20.480 --> 42:24.260]  I feel like maybe up the hill there was something.
[42:24.300 --> 42:25.300]  Up the hill? Okay.
[42:26.160 --> 42:27.180]  Can you climb up here?
[42:27.580 --> 42:28.960]  I guess not. Maybe I was wrong.
[42:29.300 --> 42:29.400]  No.
[42:29.900 --> 42:31.320]  Dude, Comet just dropped on that rock.
[42:35.360 --> 42:36.260]  No, nothing here.
[42:36.700 --> 42:37.880]  Can you hurdle the fence?
[42:38.480 --> 42:38.880]  What?
[42:40.020 --> 42:41.060]  The fence? What fence?
[42:41.100 --> 42:41.500]  To the left.
[42:44.160 --> 42:44.560]  That.
[42:46.460 --> 42:48.620]  You want to jump? You want to start all the way over?
[42:48.960 --> 42:49.980]  Yeah, there you go. Alright, cool.
[42:50.420 --> 42:50.660]  Alright.
[42:51.420 --> 42:52.080]  You should be able to.
[42:52.260 --> 42:53.740]  Derek! Derek, follow me!
[42:53.960 --> 42:54.800]  Yeah, here we go.
[42:58.540 --> 43:00.100]  You know what it is, what it is.
[43:00.820 --> 43:02.300]  Learned to jump another day.
[43:04.880 --> 43:06.620]  This game looks great.
[43:06.620 --> 43:13.100]  And unlike The Outer Worlds, no chromatic aberration, which is phenomenal.
[43:13.860 --> 43:15.440]  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Can you ring that bell?
[43:15.620 --> 43:16.020]  Oh, man.
[43:16.700 --> 43:17.960]  Is that a bell? Can you ring it?
[43:20.460 --> 43:22.320]  Alright, well, hey, look.
[43:23.080 --> 43:24.640]  Devs put it on the list.
[43:25.020 --> 43:27.040]  Bell ringing technology DLC.
[43:29.320 --> 43:31.200]  Hey, what's up? It's Zelda.
[43:31.400 --> 43:32.000]  Stay back.
[43:32.900 --> 43:34.920]  I'm not catching whatever's on your head.
[43:34.920 --> 43:36.080]  It's a god.
[43:38.880 --> 43:41.150]  She's going to beat him up for that.
[43:41.600 --> 43:45.200]  I think I'm in love.
[43:54.720 --> 43:55.760]  She's mean.
[43:56.100 --> 43:56.920]  Can you shrug?
[44:02.520 --> 44:04.080]  She is mean.
[44:04.080 --> 44:07.920]  You just got here to help, and she's like, hey, ugly, you're a dumb idiot.
[44:08.240 --> 44:10.880]  We don't have to let her out, I don't think.
[44:11.460 --> 44:13.460]  But we should.
[44:13.960 --> 44:16.200]  Okay, let's take a vote. Do we let her out?
[44:17.000 --> 44:17.260]  No.
[44:18.120 --> 44:18.200]  No.
[44:18.760 --> 44:18.960]  No.
[44:19.360 --> 44:20.320]  Okay, alright.
[44:20.640 --> 44:23.000]  Well, I vote yes, but okay, I'm overruled.
[44:25.160 --> 44:25.940]  She stays.
[44:28.360 --> 44:32.060]  I've never played a game like this where you don't let them out and you don't help them.
[44:32.060 --> 44:33.440]  I've never done it.
[44:33.440 --> 44:34.320]  You don't take the companion?
[44:34.700 --> 44:35.100]  I've never...
[44:36.080 --> 44:40.880]  Like, I am nice to everyone and all these... it's like virtuous all the way.
[44:41.200 --> 44:42.800]  Is that like a bit of escapism for you?
[44:43.160 --> 44:44.540]  Yeah, it's... yes, definitely.
[44:46.040 --> 44:47.860]  Ah, this is how the other half lives, I see.
[44:53.560 --> 44:54.560]  What are we thinking?
[44:55.080 --> 44:57.140]  I can be nice without consequences, so I just do that.
[44:57.180 --> 44:59.780]  That way, too, he doesn't feel guilty when someone's like, hey, can you help me out this week?
[44:59.800 --> 45:01.620]  And he can be like, nah, I helped somebody out in the video.
[45:01.620 --> 45:04.580]  Yeah, I already... I'm actually busy helping a bunch of people.
[45:05.560 --> 45:07.420]  I got 26 XP earlier.
[45:13.500 --> 45:15.080]  I like her accent.
[45:15.260 --> 45:16.040]  Right, then what?
[45:16.300 --> 45:16.780]  Yeah, get her.
[45:22.160 --> 45:23.280]  They frown.
[45:31.620 --> 45:34.040]  How did you know it was cannon fire, not thunder?
[45:34.380 --> 45:35.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:35.560 --> 45:36.600]  That's the hard-hitting question.
[45:36.620 --> 45:39.020]  That's honestly... honestly, it's a really good question.
[45:43.980 --> 45:45.080]  That's what I'm saying.
[45:45.560 --> 45:46.760]  You know what? It's all suspicious.
[45:46.760 --> 45:48.120]  Yeah, that's pretty suspicious.
[45:53.300 --> 45:53.700]  Clearly.
[45:55.200 --> 45:56.400]  You're making that easy.
[45:56.400 --> 45:57.720]  I'm a boat at the edge of the island.
[45:58.540 --> 46:00.180]  It should still be there.
[46:00.240 --> 46:01.480]  Oh, thanks for the knowledge.
[46:03.980 --> 46:05.100]  Keep talking.
[46:05.440 --> 46:06.240]  Keep talking.
[46:07.220 --> 46:08.600]  What else you got?
[46:12.200 --> 46:15.540]  I understood everything you said so far, so keep going.
[46:16.140 --> 46:17.580]  Got any ointment?
[46:21.280 --> 46:22.780]  My corals are dry.
[46:23.260 --> 46:23.960]  Oh, fuck.
[46:23.960 --> 46:25.220]  For fuck's sake, be reasonable.
[46:26.520 --> 46:29.960]  If we can find a way, we should get Garrick in a jail cell, too.
[46:30.540 --> 46:31.420]  Hell yeah, just in case.
[46:31.620 --> 46:32.420]  Just in case.
[46:32.620 --> 46:33.280]  Keep him safe.
[46:35.760 --> 46:37.720]  God, you guys are crazy.
[46:41.820 --> 46:43.680]  You were mean the whole time.
[46:46.180 --> 46:47.180]  Who's ugly now?
[46:49.420 --> 46:50.460]  Oh, no, don't...
[46:50.460 --> 46:51.000]  Oh, no.
[46:57.160 --> 46:58.740]  Wait, but... I want to talk some more.
[46:59.280 --> 47:00.360]  What else you got?
[47:01.140 --> 47:02.220]  Oh, so that's...
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.440]  Wow, Andrew, that was pretty rude.
[47:04.720 --> 47:07.140]  That was pretty cold, Andrew. I wasn't being serious.
[47:09.280 --> 47:10.360]  Well, you can still get her.
[47:10.640 --> 47:12.440]  Yeah, we can go back. We'll get her. We'll get her.
[47:12.500 --> 47:14.020]  But I don't think we should.
[47:15.160 --> 47:18.620]  To be clear, you can still help her, and also to be clear, we shouldn't help her.
[47:20.280 --> 47:21.120]  Where's the key?
[47:21.720 --> 47:22.740]  Oh, spoiled food.
[47:24.560 --> 47:26.300]  Stop grabbing the spoiled food.
[47:26.360 --> 47:28.180]  Why are you grabbing the spoiled food?
[47:28.240 --> 47:29.860]  I love eating spoiled food.
[47:30.060 --> 47:30.220]  What?
[47:31.220 --> 47:31.640]  No!
[47:32.320 --> 47:32.600]  No!
[47:33.200 --> 47:34.780]  You should have dropped it in her cage.
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.220]  Gotta drink that essence.
[47:37.780 --> 47:38.340]  That was a waste.
[47:39.640 --> 47:42.480]  You know what? Shoot her with the bow.
[47:43.700 --> 47:44.060]  What?
[47:44.160 --> 47:44.860]  Jesus, Nick.
[47:45.060 --> 47:45.260]  What?
[47:45.780 --> 47:46.660]  Oh, you know what you can do?
[47:46.900 --> 47:48.880]  Andrew, go back before you fall down.
[47:48.880 --> 47:50.680]  Alright, just go ahead and...
[47:50.680 --> 47:53.220]  You can shoot that... fruit.
[47:53.220 --> 47:53.480]  Poimole?
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.220]  Yeah, shoot the Poimole. It'll burn the tree out.
[47:58.180 --> 47:58.780]  That's a good call.
[47:59.800 --> 48:00.840]  Might as well set her up here.
[48:01.320 --> 48:02.440]  That's the only way out, I think.
[48:02.840 --> 48:05.280]  Yeah. Especially since we're not gonna rescue the lady.
[48:06.060 --> 48:06.300]  Yeah.
[48:07.060 --> 48:07.340]  Yeah.
[48:10.120 --> 48:11.260]  We did take a vote.
[48:11.840 --> 48:12.400]  There we go.
[48:13.260 --> 48:15.440]  Oh, you blew up that dead guy a little bit as well.
[48:20.000 --> 48:20.400]  Cool.
[48:20.780 --> 48:21.680]  Interrogation log.
[48:25.260 --> 48:26.220]  It's in the chest.
[48:29.280 --> 48:29.680]  Ooh.
[48:30.040 --> 48:30.440]  Key!
[48:30.780 --> 48:30.940]  Oh, the key!
[48:31.520 --> 48:36.880]  It'd be funny if we don't let this lady out, we take her boat, and then at the very end of the game she shows up and fucking gets revenge.
[48:39.100 --> 48:44.240]  Do you have the ability to drop the key like ten feet away from her door?
[48:44.640 --> 48:45.400]  That's a great question.
[48:45.600 --> 48:47.100]  Just so she can see it but not reach it?
[48:47.400 --> 48:47.600]  Yeah.
[48:48.080 --> 48:48.280]  See?
[48:50.600 --> 48:53.340]  I bet once you have the key it's a quest item.
[48:53.520 --> 48:54.000]  I bet.
[48:55.120 --> 48:56.340]  But it'd be cool if you could drop it.
[48:59.060 --> 49:00.720]  Are you gonna die from food poisoning?
[49:01.040 --> 49:01.240]  No!
[49:01.440 --> 49:01.860]  Don't do it!
[49:02.120 --> 49:02.820]  Go talk to her.
[49:02.900 --> 49:03.980]  Talk to her with the key in hand.
[49:04.080 --> 49:05.240]  See if she talks back now.
[49:06.500 --> 49:06.680]  Nope.
[49:07.480 --> 49:09.920]  There was something on a dead body or something in that room you didn't take.
[49:10.000 --> 49:10.500]  I don't know if you care.
[49:11.540 --> 49:11.860]  I do.
[49:13.880 --> 49:14.480]  In here?
[49:14.600 --> 49:14.800]  Yeah.
[49:15.680 --> 49:15.980]  Under.
[49:16.600 --> 49:17.000]  There you go.
[49:17.600 --> 49:18.020]  Go forward.
[49:20.480 --> 49:21.120]  Where'd it go?
[49:21.700 --> 49:22.680]  I think you got it already.
[49:22.880 --> 49:25.550]  Oh, maybe you did get it and I just didn't see it go.
[49:27.760 --> 49:28.180]  Bye!
[49:29.920 --> 49:31.320]  You guys are crazy.
[49:34.820 --> 49:36.380]  Oh wow, that did a lot of damage.
[49:36.640 --> 49:37.660]  Yeah, this is not bad.
[49:38.960 --> 49:39.380]  Wow!
[49:39.580 --> 49:40.120]  Boom, headshot.
[49:41.120 --> 49:42.780]  My bow is not as powerful.
[49:43.980 --> 49:46.880]  Well you should have grabbed this starter bow from the very beginning of the game.
[49:46.940 --> 49:47.820]  The first one in the game.
[49:48.920 --> 49:49.340]  Waterfall!
[49:49.340 --> 49:50.780]  The one difficulty up there.
[49:52.180 --> 49:53.100]  Something over here?
[49:53.440 --> 49:54.480]  Yeah, go for it, man. Waterfall.
[49:55.200 --> 49:56.460]  You were playing on hard, Gavin?
[49:56.740 --> 49:57.100]  Yeah.
[49:57.840 --> 49:58.200]  Wow.
[49:58.400 --> 49:58.740]  Why?
[49:58.940 --> 49:59.900]  That's what I'm asking.
[50:00.620 --> 50:03.440]  I don't know. I always, like, when I start a game, I just put out one.
[50:04.600 --> 50:05.400]  Oh, a difficulty?
[50:06.260 --> 50:06.520]  Yeah.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.800]  I don't have, there's like no part of me that does that.
[50:11.120 --> 50:11.500]  Did you not...
[50:11.880 --> 50:12.840]  I think you need to go down.
[50:14.060 --> 50:14.780]  You don't...
[50:14.780 --> 50:16.920]  Did it not seem like you could climb up?
[50:17.120 --> 50:17.860]  Doesn't matter, who cares.
[50:17.860 --> 50:19.880]  I was looking for stuff in the waterfall.
[50:19.980 --> 50:20.620]  He's waterfalling.
[50:22.020 --> 50:25.480]  I didn't want to leave the waterfall behind before thoroughly searched.
[50:26.020 --> 50:27.260]  I think I'll do regular...
[50:27.260 --> 50:28.140]  Oh, yes, of course.
[50:28.300 --> 50:31.260]  ...difficulty on my first playthrough, and then I'll up it if I go back.
[50:32.020 --> 50:33.280]  Oh, look, there's a banana man.
[50:33.780 --> 50:33.820]  Oh.
[50:33.820 --> 50:34.960]  Oh, a banana man!
[50:35.460 --> 50:37.380]  Oh, no, that's just his friend.
[50:38.180 --> 50:38.580]  That's...
[50:38.580 --> 50:39.300]  Okay, he's good.
[50:40.020 --> 50:40.880]  What is that?
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.440]  Like, what kind of creature is that?
[50:43.300 --> 50:43.920]  Yeah, I don't know.
[50:43.940 --> 50:44.760]  Like a little lemur.
[50:45.040 --> 50:46.860]  It's like a little kinkachu, but like not...
[50:46.860 --> 50:48.040]  I don't know, it's weird.
[50:50.920 --> 50:52.660]  Either way, man, we love the banana man.
[50:54.420 --> 50:56.120]  We do love the banana man.
[50:56.520 --> 50:56.680]  Yeah.
[50:57.080 --> 50:58.040]  We're a banana man podcast.
[50:59.200 --> 51:00.160]  Oh, undeniably.
[51:02.240 --> 51:03.500]  Undeniably banana man.
[51:03.500 --> 51:03.760]  Banana man!
[51:04.080 --> 51:05.340]  Where are you?
[51:05.400 --> 51:06.800]  We're gonna get you, banana man!
[51:07.380 --> 51:07.860]  Oh, what a...
[51:07.860 --> 51:08.120]  Oh!
[51:08.560 --> 51:09.040]  Cool!
[51:10.160 --> 51:10.300]  Wow!
[51:11.720 --> 51:11.860]  What?
[51:11.860 --> 51:12.800]  Man, thanks for the rainbow.
[51:14.360 --> 51:15.700]  How did that happen?
[51:16.460 --> 51:17.940]  It's one of our god powers.
[51:18.340 --> 51:19.920]  That was awesome!
[51:20.680 --> 51:21.320]  See the rainbow?
[51:21.780 --> 51:22.400]  Stealth the rainbow.
[51:23.480 --> 51:24.380]  Slit the rainbow.
[51:25.860 --> 51:27.760]  I love the way you stab with two...
[51:28.700 --> 51:29.040]  Knives.
[51:29.280 --> 51:30.420]  It's so awesome.
[51:30.700 --> 51:31.800]  It is so...
[51:31.800 --> 51:34.780]  Could you imagine a guy just coming at you?
[51:34.920 --> 51:35.500]  He's got two knives.
[51:35.500 --> 51:36.780]  Oh my god, it would be so scary.
[51:37.040 --> 51:37.980]  And it is just...
[51:38.600 --> 51:39.080]  Relentless.
[51:39.580 --> 51:41.500]  He's just left and righting you.
[51:41.660 --> 51:42.000]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.180]  There's just no reprieve.
[51:43.260 --> 51:43.700]  No.
[51:43.700 --> 51:45.320]  Don't care about my own health.
[51:46.380 --> 51:47.560]  Hit me, I dare you.
[51:47.640 --> 51:48.820]  What's up with that waterfall, dude?
[51:49.760 --> 51:50.520]  Oh yeah.
[51:50.800 --> 51:51.720]  Might be above you.
[51:52.960 --> 51:53.680]  Level up.
[51:53.780 --> 51:55.120]  Let's level up first.
[51:56.060 --> 51:56.940]  What are we adding?
[51:57.040 --> 51:57.620]  What are we boosting?
[51:59.300 --> 52:00.440]  What do we want to make more strong?
[52:01.760 --> 52:03.380]  Probably our attack speed.
[52:03.740 --> 52:06.480]  I kind of want dexterity up so you can stab faster.
[52:06.780 --> 52:07.000]  Yeah.
[52:07.580 --> 52:07.860]  Do it.
[52:07.880 --> 52:08.300]  That's a good point.
[52:08.580 --> 52:09.360]  Let's do that.
[52:09.380 --> 52:13.440]  Just feels like you want to stab as fast as you can.
[52:13.440 --> 52:13.940]  Abilities.
[52:14.460 --> 52:15.580]  You already have charge?
[52:15.660 --> 52:16.540]  Or you can unlock the charge?
[52:16.620 --> 52:17.420]  Because you want charge, right?
[52:17.660 --> 52:18.120]  You can unlock charge.
[52:18.280 --> 52:19.340]  Yeah, you want it, don't you?
[52:19.560 --> 52:19.820]  You want charge?
[52:19.960 --> 52:20.980]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[52:21.200 --> 52:22.520]  Are there other ones in the other...
[52:23.120 --> 52:23.300]  Yeah.
[52:23.360 --> 52:23.960]  Like ranger and stuff?
[52:24.180 --> 52:24.540]  Oh.
[52:25.540 --> 52:25.900]  Tanglefoot.
[52:25.900 --> 52:26.560]  Summon a root.
[52:26.900 --> 52:27.260]  Boring.
[52:27.360 --> 52:27.820]  Keep going.
[52:28.520 --> 52:28.880]  Wizard.
[52:29.260 --> 52:30.120]  Summons three projectiles.
[52:30.240 --> 52:30.520]  Boring.
[52:30.800 --> 52:31.240]  Keep going.
[52:31.360 --> 52:31.380]  That's it.
[52:31.380 --> 52:32.660]  This doesn't help you stab faster.
[52:33.380 --> 52:33.600]  Okay.
[52:33.700 --> 52:35.000]  This is our base thing.
[52:35.280 --> 52:36.140]  So we want charge?
[52:36.160 --> 52:36.680]  I think it's charge.
[52:36.740 --> 52:40.000]  I think you've got to get in there and just start stabbing and hitting people with the
[52:40.000 --> 52:40.180]  shield.
[52:41.220 --> 52:44.180]  And it's good because if you miss with the knives, they'll definitely get cut by your
[52:44.180 --> 52:44.900]  nose or chin.
[52:45.520 --> 52:45.880]  Exactly.
[52:46.200 --> 52:46.560]  Waterfall.
[52:46.560 --> 52:48.320]  You're trying to get in there as quick as you can.
[52:48.940 --> 52:49.080]  Waterfall.
[52:49.120 --> 52:49.480]  Waterfall.
[52:49.760 --> 52:50.680]  He just doesn't even...
[52:50.680 --> 52:52.780]  Geoff, he just doesn't even clock the waterfalls, man.
[52:53.340 --> 52:54.300]  Dude, son of a bitch.
[52:54.580 --> 52:55.400]  I missed that one too.
[52:55.480 --> 52:55.980]  I suck.
[52:56.000 --> 52:56.980]  I didn't get this one either.
[52:56.980 --> 52:58.060]  You guys are ridiculous.
[52:58.200 --> 52:59.260]  You're not even equipping this stuff?
[52:59.300 --> 53:00.460]  Put this stuff on, dude.
[53:00.980 --> 53:02.140]  Yeah, let's put it on.
[53:02.540 --> 53:03.720]  I think you've got gloves.
[53:04.800 --> 53:05.380]  Look at this.
[53:05.400 --> 53:05.980]  You've got boots.
[53:06.280 --> 53:06.920]  Deer skin.
[53:08.120 --> 53:08.480]  Wow.
[53:09.140 --> 53:09.860]  They match.
[53:10.260 --> 53:12.260]  What does it mean to transmogrify?
[53:12.380 --> 53:15.080]  Is that just when one thing looks like another thing, but it's actually one thing?
[53:15.320 --> 53:19.120]  Yeah, you can like use different armor, but make it look like the armor you think is more
[53:19.120 --> 53:19.140]  aesthetic.
[53:19.140 --> 53:19.340]  That's cool.
[53:19.780 --> 53:20.480]  I like that.
[53:21.300 --> 53:22.020]  I love when games do that.
[53:22.020 --> 53:23.620]  Sometimes good armor is ugly.
[53:23.840 --> 53:24.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.280]  And you want to have it look like something totally different and it like ruins it.
[53:29.520 --> 53:30.220]  Yeah, maybe.
[53:30.400 --> 53:30.880]  I don't remember.
[53:31.440 --> 53:32.460]  But definitely...
[53:32.460 --> 53:33.560]  We're definitely not done.
[53:33.640 --> 53:35.360]  There's definitely at least one or two more you can go behind.
[53:35.920 --> 53:36.280]  Wow.
[53:36.520 --> 53:37.980]  And you guys didn't do any of that, huh?
[53:37.980 --> 53:40.140]  No, I've missed every one.
[53:40.860 --> 53:45.160]  After seeing how Andrew plays this game, that doesn't surprise me, but I am surprised that
[53:45.880 --> 53:46.700]  Gavin missed it.
[53:47.280 --> 53:51.080]  I want to point out as well that whenever I use frost, it never does that to them.
[53:51.820 --> 53:52.420]  Oh, bummer.
[53:53.280 --> 53:54.760]  Oh, that would be cool.
[53:54.780 --> 53:56.520]  Yeah, it's fucking bullshit, that frost.
[53:57.020 --> 53:57.980]  I miss a lot.
[53:58.500 --> 53:59.760]  It's not good the way I just spread.
[54:00.460 --> 54:01.480]  Wizard with a shield.
[54:01.700 --> 54:02.920]  I miss with that root a lot.
[54:03.180 --> 54:03.800]  It's fucking annoying.
[54:05.940 --> 54:07.220]  Oh, I don't have the root.
[54:08.320 --> 54:09.460]  How do we...
[54:09.460 --> 54:12.080]  You gotta throw a projectile at it if you don't have the root.
[54:12.100 --> 54:12.440]  There you go.
[54:13.240 --> 54:13.880]  You missed.
[54:14.200 --> 54:14.480]  You missed.
[54:14.600 --> 54:15.220]  You missed.
[54:15.500 --> 54:16.000]  You missed.
[54:16.120 --> 54:16.820]  There you go, buddy.
[54:17.160 --> 54:17.680]  Way to go, bud.
[54:17.740 --> 54:18.140]  I got it.
[54:18.680 --> 54:19.000]  Yeah.
[54:19.680 --> 54:21.600]  I just used fire from my hands for that.
[54:21.720 --> 54:22.880]  Great job, Harry Potter.
[54:24.120 --> 54:25.000]  Yeah, get him, Geoff.
[54:26.800 --> 54:27.740]  Thwip, thwip, thwip.
[54:28.700 --> 54:29.040]  Can you...
[54:29.040 --> 54:29.940]  You got the high ground, Harry.
[54:30.160 --> 54:32.880]  I want to see you charge at this guy and stab him a hundred times.
[54:34.640 --> 54:35.280]  Oh, can you sneak up?
[54:35.280 --> 54:35.520]  Oh!
[54:37.400 --> 54:38.080]  Oh, whoops.
[54:38.260 --> 54:39.000]  That's not...
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.220]  Wrong loadout, wrong loadout.
[54:40.380 --> 54:40.960]  This isn't...
[54:40.960 --> 54:41.880]  Oh, Andrew.
[54:42.640 --> 54:43.440]  Andrew, no.
[54:44.860 --> 54:45.040]  Boo!
[54:45.040 --> 54:45.620]  He's stunned, though.
[54:45.620 --> 54:46.200]  He's getting stunned.
[54:46.520 --> 54:47.080]  There you go.
[54:48.620 --> 54:48.940]  Oh!
[54:49.520 --> 54:51.160]  He kicked his dick out.
[54:51.240 --> 54:52.540]  Oh, my God.
[54:53.420 --> 54:54.160]  Wizard with a shield.
[54:57.580 --> 54:58.880]  That was pretty cool.
[54:59.160 --> 55:00.180]  Bop, bop, bop.
[55:00.220 --> 55:00.660]  This rocks.
[55:02.420 --> 55:02.640]  Shield.
[55:02.860 --> 55:03.040]  Nice.
[55:03.180 --> 55:04.220]  Bop, bop, bop.
[55:04.220 --> 55:09.040]  I think on my difficulty it was doing, like, three damage per thwip, but I was just doing it for, like, an hour.
[55:10.180 --> 55:11.380]  Thwip, thwip, thwip.
[55:12.540 --> 55:13.440]  Oh, it's so good.
[55:13.500 --> 55:14.280]  It locks on.
[55:14.480 --> 55:14.720]  Nice.
[55:14.720 --> 55:15.300]  It's so accurate.
[55:15.940 --> 55:17.100]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[55:17.200 --> 55:18.120]  I am playing...
[55:18.120 --> 55:18.880]  I'm playing the wrong game.
[55:18.900 --> 55:19.140]  Look out!
[55:19.720 --> 55:20.780]  You didn't ever use the wand?
[55:21.100 --> 55:22.100]  No, never touched it.
[55:22.440 --> 55:23.380]  I broke it down immediately.
[55:25.260 --> 55:26.020]  What about the book?
[55:26.480 --> 55:28.140]  I used the book and a dagger.
[55:29.000 --> 55:29.080]  Oh, okay.
[55:29.080 --> 55:31.000]  And then my secondary is just a pistol.
[55:31.060 --> 55:31.500]  Eat shit!
[55:33.140 --> 55:35.960]  I like how different all of our games have been so far.
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.120]  I have never fought this easily in the game once.
[55:40.220 --> 55:42.320]  Like, this is amazing to me.
[55:42.760 --> 55:44.280]  Are you on a harder difficulty, too?
[55:44.560 --> 55:45.600]  No, I'm playing normal, dude.
[55:45.720 --> 55:47.200]  But I'm so glad I'm playing normal.
[55:48.120 --> 55:49.260]  My choice is...
[55:49.260 --> 55:49.300]  Waterfall!
[55:49.820 --> 55:50.060]  Yeah.
[55:52.740 --> 55:54.440]  I wanted there to be something there so bad.
[55:57.460 --> 55:58.820]  Don't worry, there will be eventually.
[56:00.100 --> 56:00.540]  Whoa.
[56:02.580 --> 56:03.340]  Oh no!
[56:05.160 --> 56:06.260]  Oh, I remember this part.
[56:08.340 --> 56:09.180]  Is it cool?
[56:11.800 --> 56:13.460]  Oh, sneak up on him! Sneak up on him! Sneak up!
[56:13.960 --> 56:15.320]  Oh, he's like a guy.
[56:15.700 --> 56:16.800]  You want me to charge him?
[56:17.320 --> 56:18.040]  Oh, fuck.
[56:18.600 --> 56:20.480]  Oh, he's another godman or whatever.
[56:21.020 --> 56:22.140]  No, he's...
[56:32.040 --> 56:33.560]  He's got what Banana Man had.
[56:34.180 --> 56:36.700]  Oh no! He's got the Banana Man's?
[56:36.880 --> 56:38.220]  How about let's not assume anything?
[56:42.700 --> 56:44.080]  Let's hear this guy out.
[56:44.340 --> 56:44.540]  Yep.
[56:46.540 --> 56:48.260]  With his eyes, geez.
[56:51.160 --> 56:53.200]  We're gonna burn piss holes right through him.
[56:56.780 --> 56:58.540]  I'm gonna say that to more people.
[56:58.800 --> 56:59.380]  Steady yourself.
[56:59.580 --> 57:00.220]  Steady yourself.
[57:00.480 --> 57:00.940]  Yeah, I like that.
[57:02.040 --> 57:02.200]  Shit.
[57:04.620 --> 57:06.880]  You can't understand us, can you?
[57:07.720 --> 57:08.420]  You're dumb.
[57:11.040 --> 57:11.300]  Whoa.
[57:18.580 --> 57:19.960]  Pretty good slam poetry.
[57:20.500 --> 57:20.800]  Yeah.
[57:23.580 --> 57:24.860]  That's pretty...
[57:24.860 --> 57:25.040]  What?
[57:30.350 --> 57:31.310]  Oh, okay.
[57:31.310 --> 57:32.930]  You need to pay.
[57:33.590 --> 57:34.330]  What? Hang on, wait.
[57:34.710 --> 57:35.270]  This...
[57:35.910 --> 57:38.510]  This is no unease of the mind.
[57:38.870 --> 57:41.230]  I suspect dark magic isn't work.
[57:43.630 --> 57:46.030]  Methinks there is a problem here.
[57:46.470 --> 57:46.990]  Hypocrites.
[57:47.250 --> 57:47.810]  Hypocrites.
[57:48.370 --> 57:50.330]  They bring the night and call it Christmas.
[57:50.330 --> 57:51.650]  I like how you've just been like...
[57:51.650 --> 57:53.870]  and doing your way through the game and then you say that.
[57:54.330 --> 57:55.130]  You gotta...
[57:55.130 --> 57:56.450]  Look, he's...
[57:56.450 --> 57:57.430]  He's an idiot savant.
[57:57.750 --> 57:58.010]  Whoa!
[57:59.390 --> 58:01.090]  What the goddamn?
[58:02.310 --> 58:03.750]  What are you doing here?
[58:09.730 --> 58:12.190]  Shit, do you have to fight them both?
[58:12.570 --> 58:13.250]  Uh-oh.
[58:13.250 --> 58:14.230]  Oh, no.
[58:16.550 --> 58:17.170]  Bomb won.
[58:17.670 --> 58:18.470]  I'm sorry.
[58:19.630 --> 58:21.130]  Andrew has his own ideas.
[58:25.880 --> 58:27.430]  Oh, shit.
[58:27.430 --> 58:27.870]  Oh, no.
[58:31.010 --> 58:32.210]  Get out of there.
[58:32.570 --> 58:32.930]  Damn.
[58:34.070 --> 58:35.230]  Andrew, you really...
[58:35.230 --> 58:35.670]  It's a hard giraffian.
[58:35.890 --> 58:36.250]  Hammer.
[58:36.690 --> 58:38.270]  Oh, you just stabbed both of his eyes out.
[58:38.670 --> 58:39.310]  It's gruesome.
[58:39.490 --> 58:40.950]  He can't see shit anymore.
[58:41.990 --> 58:43.270]  Hat cut, hat cut.
[58:44.070 --> 58:45.570]  You need to get out of there.
[58:46.210 --> 58:46.770]  There you go.
[58:48.010 --> 58:49.030]  We gotta stun him.
[58:49.290 --> 58:49.890]  We gotta stun him.
[58:49.970 --> 58:50.910]  We're close, we're close, we're close.
[58:51.030 --> 58:51.990]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[58:52.210 --> 58:52.850]  Get him, get him, get him.
[58:53.690 --> 58:54.670]  Oh, you gotta kick his...
[58:54.670 --> 58:54.950]  Oh, no.
[58:55.030 --> 58:56.030]  He's gonna shit bricks.
[58:57.510 --> 58:59.430]  Don't forget about your right...
[58:59.990 --> 59:00.290]  Oh, my God.
[59:00.450 --> 59:00.650]  What?
[59:01.330 --> 59:02.350]  There you go.
[59:02.570 --> 59:03.650]  He's almost stunned.
[59:03.710 --> 59:04.330]  There you go.
[59:04.570 --> 59:04.910]  Boom.
[59:05.310 --> 59:06.050]  Get him.
[59:06.050 --> 59:06.890]  Get him on his down.
[59:08.210 --> 59:09.590]  How did you magic him?
[59:09.670 --> 59:10.950]  Why would you do this?
[59:11.090 --> 59:12.590]  Because I can attack him at a range.
[59:16.850 --> 59:19.290]  Let me run into this swinging hammer.
[59:19.590 --> 59:20.430]  He's unstunned.
[59:21.170 --> 59:22.810]  I better get in there.
[59:23.090 --> 59:23.430]  Yeah.
[59:24.550 --> 59:25.070]  Nice.
[59:25.770 --> 59:26.950]  You thought that was all?
[59:27.870 --> 59:29.470]  Oh, let's put the hammer on.
[59:30.030 --> 59:31.130]  Oh, go get her with the hammer.
[59:31.310 --> 59:32.350]  Go get her with the hammer.
[59:32.490 --> 59:33.350]  Teach her who's boss.
[59:36.370 --> 59:37.910]  Oh, my God.
[59:38.490 --> 59:38.630]  Charge.
[59:40.990 --> 59:42.450]  I had no idea you could fight her.
[59:42.450 --> 59:44.690]  To be fair, she was not nice to you.
[59:44.990 --> 59:45.610]  She has a gun.
[59:46.990 --> 59:48.370]  Oh, she does have a gun.
[59:48.670 --> 59:49.530]  Yeah, you got a pistol.
[59:49.630 --> 59:50.250]  Oh, my God.
[59:50.570 --> 59:51.690]  I didn't know she had a gun.
[59:52.210 --> 59:53.290]  Is she in your party, Gavin?
[59:54.290 --> 59:56.330]  She definitely came with me to...
[59:57.210 --> 59:58.410]  Yeah, the next bit.
[59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.330]  She didn't stay in the party, I don't think.
[01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.710]  Oh, now I can go bop, bop, bop.
[01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:03.290]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.130]  She didn't stay in the party here either.
[01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.150]  Did you get everything here?
[01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.510]  Oh, a grave robber.
[01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:11.610]  Let's steal some stuff.
[01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.530]  I had no idea you could already have a gun at this point.
[01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:14.450]  That rocks.
[01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:15.090]  That's crazy.
[01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:17.690]  Didn't even have to wait three hours.
[01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.830]  Insane.
[01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:21.950]  Yeah, it's even faster than I got, I'm sure.
[01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:26.710]  So, what I'm understanding, a bunch of different ways to play this game.
[01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:27.690]  So many.
[01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:30.230]  It's one of the coolest aspects of this thing.
[01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:33.890]  Gotta do this part.
[01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:34.330]  Yeah.
[01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:37.190]  We should have all recorded the first hour of us playing it.
[01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:38.730]  Just a weird montage.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:49.500]  God.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.900]  Are you alright?
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:01.620]  Hey, you sounded different.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.480]  Yeah, that wasn't me, man.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.060]  I like how it's on him to tell us that we had another point.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.420]  Like, dude.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.140]  No, I'm fine.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.260]  No, I said I didn't.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.420]  Nah, I think that job's you, dude.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.660]  Maybe I'm infected.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:21.960]  Me, specifically?
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.080]  I probably hit my head in the shipwreck.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:26.480]  Yeah.
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.200]  He never hit your head.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.360]  He hit his barnacles.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.100]  He's making a large assumption, even though that other guy was also talking to himself.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.260]  I think it's fair to say we're built different.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.620]  We have bigger things to worry about.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.040]  I think the biggest upside is that so far, no one's noticed our bald spot.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:48.440]  Yeah.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.040]  I think that means you're getting away with it.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:52.760]  Yeah.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:52.800]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:00.320]  I think the thing I have the most questions about is where's the banana man?
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.400]  What's the banana man doing?
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.180]  I wish he hadn't attacked us.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.300]  Frowned thoughtfully.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.100]  I like the way you were saying she would show up at the end of the game.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.080]  She literally showed up at the end of the next room.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.040]  You have to stop it, no matter what it takes.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.200]  Knowing my luck is bound to get worse.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.620]  I don't know how, but if anyone can find a way, it's you.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.640]  Nobody's got a case of the Mondays or whatever in this universe.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.740]  They could have Mondays.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.700]  It's like Moondays.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.540]  I don't know.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.560]  The burned.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.380]  I think this is the perfect place to stop this video.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.900]  Paradise intro mission.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.260]  Thank you so much everyone for watching.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.860]  Thank you to Xbox and Obsidian for giving us access so we can release this video timely.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.420]  This is a lot of fun.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.980]  I'm really having fun with this game.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.480]  How far into you hours wise?
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.440]  I'm probably like 25 hours.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.660]  I'd say I'm pretty, pretty far, but it's great.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.760]  And it sounds like you've got probably a good six hours of waterfalls to go back and look through.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.240]  Oh, yeah, I got to go back.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.400]  I got to find all the waterfalls.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.680]  You you've played other obsidian games, right?
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:27.720]  Like, yes.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.520]  Does this feel like any of them?
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.840]  It feels sort of like the Outer Worlds in a different skin.
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:39.540]  But there's a lot more, I'd say, exploring in this one than Outer Worlds.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.560]  Interesting. Absolutely.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.140]  It's great. But if you like Outer Worlds, you'll definitely like this.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.280]  Great game studio.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.260]  Well, I guess I could play this or I can replay Fallout New Vegas for a ninth time.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:04:00.220]  I might check out Avowed and put my next Fallout New Vegas replay on the back burner because I kind of like this.
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.620]  And I and I'm determined to find out what happened to the banana man.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.860]  You gotta find out what happened to the banana man.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.300]  Where is he? What's he doing?
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.900]  What? Oh, he got big? He's big now?
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.560]  It could be big. It could be Gravemind of Bananaman.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.340]  Oh, Bananaman.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:19.760]  Also, this thing does something incredibly well that's so important in video games that so many don't do.
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.720]  And it handles fast travel great.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:22.600]  Oh, really?
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.020]  Very easy to get around the map.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:24.500]  Great fast travel.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.280]  There's a little beacon just ahead that opens when I think.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.280]  Yeah, we'll go ahead and grab it and save and quit there.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.640]  Well, thanks Obsidian.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.820]  And this has been Ian.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.480]  This has been the Bananaman.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.960]  And we'll see you guys next time.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.840]  Thank you. Bye.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:42.760]  Bye.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.580]  Bye-bye.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.060]  Was that Hilary Duff?
