[00:00.000 --> 00:02.900]  I hope I never get that disease where you have to eat other people's poop.
[00:03.860 --> 00:04.680]  You have to eat the poop?
[00:04.680 --> 00:08.820]  Hello and welcome to another GTA regulation gameplay.
[00:08.900 --> 00:10.540]  We got a mini heist. They added new content.
[00:10.760 --> 00:12.160]  It's the Agents of Sabotage.
[00:12.480 --> 00:13.600]  We're doing...
[00:13.600 --> 00:14.600]  How many are we talking?
[00:16.200 --> 00:17.300]  Uh, what do you mean?
[00:17.460 --> 00:18.120]  How many heists?
[00:19.000 --> 00:19.220]  Yeah.
[00:19.700 --> 00:24.300]  Well, there's four, but there's one special one that rotates weekly.
[00:24.660 --> 00:26.200]  So we're doing the first week one.
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.460]  It's called the Brute Force File.
[00:29.140 --> 00:29.540]  OK.
[00:30.260 --> 00:31.400]  Who wants to...
[00:31.400 --> 00:32.020]  Nick, you want to lift?
[00:32.400 --> 00:32.920]  Yes, please.
[00:34.140 --> 00:35.060]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[00:35.700 --> 00:36.100]  Oops.
[00:38.540 --> 00:38.940]  OK.
[00:39.560 --> 00:42.340]  Do I have to, like, come to you guys or like, what's the plan here?
[00:42.700 --> 00:43.060]  We're fine.
[00:43.900 --> 00:47.640]  She is explaining how shit works on my screen right now.
[00:47.800 --> 00:48.000]  OK.
[00:48.060 --> 00:51.360]  We're going to start with private military armor is the mission.
[00:51.820 --> 00:53.140]  Oh, easy. Let's go get it.
[00:53.340 --> 00:54.360]  Retrieve some armor.
[00:55.160 --> 00:55.520]  Easy.
[00:55.880 --> 00:56.860]  I would love to start it,
[00:56.860 --> 01:00.400]  but I have to wait for her to finish talking about it and launch it.
[01:00.900 --> 01:03.080]  And then, like, none of us are allowed to see it.
[01:03.120 --> 01:05.100]  You're the only one that like that's like allowed to see it.
[01:05.740 --> 01:06.600]  We'll find out.
[01:06.680 --> 01:08.180]  I guess we've I've never done this.
[01:08.260 --> 01:09.100]  This just came out.
[01:10.700 --> 01:14.480]  So this is just like a weekly event that will be gone next week.
[01:15.160 --> 01:16.400]  This specific one.
[01:16.540 --> 01:16.900]  Yes.
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.460]  But there are three other ones that are like stationary.
[01:20.180 --> 01:20.580]  OK.
[01:21.400 --> 01:22.260]  Who's in the red suit?
[01:22.960 --> 01:23.420]  That's me.
[01:23.900 --> 01:26.580]  Hey, OK.
[01:26.940 --> 01:28.220]  Go to the Meriwether lockup.
[01:28.300 --> 01:29.420]  You guys see that marker?
[01:29.540 --> 01:30.220]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30.220 --> 01:31.280]  Just it just popped. Yeah.
[01:31.720 --> 01:32.920]  Yeah. Hopping in.
[01:33.160 --> 01:34.140]  Eric, where are you at, son?
[01:34.560 --> 01:36.120]  I'm driving over to the Meriwether lockup.
[01:36.180 --> 01:38.320]  It's the indicator that just popped up on your screen.
[01:38.720 --> 01:39.900]  You want to meet him over there?
[01:40.140 --> 01:40.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40.960 --> 01:42.580]  I've I've learned a lot so far.
[01:42.720 --> 01:44.220]  I think this just came out.
[01:44.280 --> 01:47.380]  So you probably don't really know what's happening yet, but I can help you.
[01:48.400 --> 01:49.280]  I bet we'll beat you there.
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.160]  Hmm. No way.
[01:51.540 --> 01:55.920]  I was amazed at how far I was able to fly backwards without hitting something there.
[01:56.240 --> 01:57.420]  What? Are you in a helicopter?
[01:57.820 --> 01:59.180]  Yeah. Oh, geez.
[01:59.780 --> 02:01.280]  That's why I said I think we'll beat you there.
[02:02.080 --> 02:03.120]  Not if I shoot you down.
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.240]  Oh, I see, Eric.
[02:04.940 --> 02:05.300]  Yeah.
[02:06.320 --> 02:08.000]  I mean, you pick me up if you want to, but you don't have to.
[02:08.440 --> 02:09.240]  I'm very fast.
[02:09.780 --> 02:10.700]  I'm a quick little guy.
[02:12.580 --> 02:13.280]  I'm snappy.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.880]  Oh, God, that looked awesome from up here.
[02:18.820 --> 02:20.300]  I'm just I'm having fun.
[02:21.340 --> 02:23.020]  Oh, does this look good?
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.080]  You guys getting me?
[02:24.660 --> 02:25.540]  Yeah, you look great.
[02:25.980 --> 02:27.180]  Cool. All right. Get in.
[02:27.320 --> 02:29.060]  Oh, God. Geoff, how does Eric look?
[02:29.360 --> 02:30.780]  Oh, my God. What the fuck?
[02:32.700 --> 02:34.480]  All right. I got that guy. He won't hit us.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.660]  Stop. Don't get in the car.
[02:39.640 --> 02:40.580]  No, no. Stop.
[02:40.880 --> 02:42.020]  In the helicopter.
[02:43.020 --> 02:45.680]  Oh, if you'd landed on the tracks, the train actually would have hit us.
[02:45.700 --> 02:46.260]  That'd be awesome.
[02:47.080 --> 02:47.500]  Oh, shit.
[02:47.580 --> 02:50.140]  So we do have Geoff here and he's watching.
[02:50.140 --> 02:52.920]  But he is watching as a silent observer, I think.
[02:53.420 --> 02:54.320]  Oh, muted.
[02:54.900 --> 02:57.260]  Yeah, I think I think he's doing his.
[02:57.480 --> 02:59.640]  Boy, you guys missed all my funny commentary.
[03:01.800 --> 03:04.640]  Yeah, I can't believe we did that.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.960]  Oh, you got it.
[03:07.700 --> 03:09.180]  Yeah, that's how it's done.
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.060]  All right.
[03:10.220 --> 03:11.880]  Those are moving. Fuck off.
[03:13.860 --> 03:16.800]  Geoff, was your commentary really, really good as whatever?
[03:16.940 --> 03:19.880]  I was just talking about how you seemed really trepidatious to be on the mission.
[03:19.880 --> 03:21.340]  You seemed indecisive.
[03:22.240 --> 03:25.340]  Uh, I just had questions and I wasn't getting any answers.
[03:25.420 --> 03:25.820]  You know what I mean?
[03:26.040 --> 03:27.780]  You're like, I'm going to get back in the car and go home.
[03:27.920 --> 03:28.580]  I'm not doing this.
[03:28.840 --> 03:29.440]  Gavin, what do you think?
[03:30.020 --> 03:30.660]  About what?
[03:31.060 --> 03:31.740]  Who's flying?
[03:32.280 --> 03:32.520]  What?
[03:32.860 --> 03:34.640]  Gavin, I think you should land us on that boat.
[03:35.300 --> 03:36.440]  Oh, on the boat? Yeah, I'll do that.
[03:36.820 --> 03:36.980]  All right.
[03:37.160 --> 03:39.140]  Are we taking out these bugs?
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.220]  What are we doing?
[03:41.060 --> 03:41.900]  We're getting shot.
[03:42.040 --> 03:42.500]  God, I'm telling you, mothers.
[03:43.600 --> 03:44.420]  Get him, get him, get him.
[03:45.400 --> 03:46.520]  Strafe, strafe, kill him.
[03:46.800 --> 03:47.780]  Oh, God, we're down.
[03:47.960 --> 03:48.500]  We're down.
[03:48.500 --> 03:50.060]  I'm out. We're a leap temporarily down.
[03:50.120 --> 03:50.480]  Shit.
[03:50.500 --> 03:51.180]  Oh, I'm doing so well.
[03:51.280 --> 03:52.240]  Oh, God, we're back.
[03:54.720 --> 03:56.000]  Oh, holy shit.
[03:56.360 --> 03:58.280]  Oh, I'm in the middle of a war zone.
[03:59.860 --> 04:00.580]  Oh, fuck.
[04:03.460 --> 04:05.180]  You're watching this and Gavin died.
[04:05.460 --> 04:06.060]  All right.
[04:06.340 --> 04:08.200]  Start over, maybe, or...
[04:08.200 --> 04:09.040]  I don't think we have lives.
[04:09.320 --> 04:09.960]  I think we're all good.
[04:10.400 --> 04:11.120]  Oh, sick.
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.080]  Cool.
[04:12.200 --> 04:12.600]  This is infinite.
[04:12.640 --> 04:13.640]  Oh, we got to kill more of them.
[04:14.580 --> 04:15.740]  Get inside. I need help.
[04:15.880 --> 04:16.360]  I need help.
[04:16.360 --> 04:16.840]  I'm coming in.
[04:17.060 --> 04:18.080]  It's loading, dammit.
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.080]  Load faster.
[04:22.620 --> 04:23.640]  Up with the door.
[04:23.980 --> 04:24.660]  They're flanking.
[04:25.400 --> 04:26.660]  I'm dead. I'm going to die.
[04:27.200 --> 04:27.860]  Oh, we're OK.
[04:28.100 --> 04:28.600]  They have advanced tactics.
[04:29.360 --> 04:30.200]  I'm here with you.
[04:31.460 --> 04:32.840]  Gavin, they have advanced tactics.
[04:33.340 --> 04:35.540]  OK, coming in to deal with advanced tactics.
[04:35.940 --> 04:37.720]  All right, here comes the rat for advanced tactics.
[04:38.260 --> 04:39.200]  Oh, there's only one more.
[04:39.900 --> 04:40.380]  Oh, good.
[04:40.860 --> 04:41.580]  I'm here just in time.
[04:41.640 --> 04:41.800]  We got it.
[04:42.300 --> 04:43.480]  Hell yeah, guys, way to go.
[04:43.560 --> 04:45.280]  Hey, guys, way to go, team.
[04:45.640 --> 04:46.920]  That's what I'm talking about.
[04:47.080 --> 04:47.480]  I don't know.
[04:47.540 --> 04:48.300]  We can't hurt him, though.
[04:49.260 --> 04:50.060]  You're right.
[04:50.180 --> 04:52.040]  We got to search the cars for armor.
[04:52.240 --> 04:52.980]  You got it.
[04:53.380 --> 04:53.900]  Let's see.
[04:53.940 --> 04:55.020]  How do I locate the armor?
[04:55.140 --> 04:56.280]  You don't have any body armor.
[04:56.420 --> 04:57.320]  This one's locked.
[04:58.580 --> 04:59.940]  I'm looking in the contender.
[05:01.160 --> 05:02.120]  Nothing in it.
[05:02.340 --> 05:02.600]  Shit.
[05:03.380 --> 05:04.480]  Where the fuck is it?
[05:04.540 --> 05:05.700]  Guys, the contender is empty.
[05:05.920 --> 05:06.760]  Is it in this box?
[05:08.780 --> 05:09.680]  Locate the armor.
[05:10.140 --> 05:10.400]  Mm hmm.
[05:10.640 --> 05:11.340]  Oh, here we go.
[05:11.460 --> 05:12.020]  Maybe in this one.
[05:12.720 --> 05:14.380]  All right, Geoff, I'm looking in the contender.
[05:15.020 --> 05:15.700]  I see that.
[05:16.180 --> 05:18.280]  Oh, I think you found it.
[05:18.280 --> 05:19.180]  Hell yeah.
[05:19.180 --> 05:20.160]  I've located the armor.
[05:20.700 --> 05:21.400]  Ow, I got shot.
[05:22.180 --> 05:22.900]  Let's take it.
[05:23.120 --> 05:23.920]  Let's go, boys.
[05:25.340 --> 05:26.340]  Oh, there's more of them.
[05:26.520 --> 05:27.160]  Who shot them?
[05:27.220 --> 05:27.420]  Oh, God.
[05:27.480 --> 05:28.180]  Get in the thing.
[05:28.280 --> 05:28.900]  Get in the thing.
[05:29.020 --> 05:29.720]  Gavin, get in the car.
[05:30.020 --> 05:30.800]  Do we not need to kill them?
[05:30.820 --> 05:31.360]  Okay, let's go.
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.340]  We killed them.
[05:32.500 --> 05:32.860]  They're dead.
[05:33.400 --> 05:33.760]  What the?
[05:34.200 --> 05:34.800]  Oh, sorry.
[05:35.020 --> 05:35.680]  I popped there earlier.
[05:38.360 --> 05:39.680]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[05:43.360 --> 05:44.400]  Where's the freeway?
[05:44.680 --> 05:44.860]  What?
[05:44.860 --> 05:45.540]  What's happening?
[05:46.000 --> 05:46.900]  Who are we working for?
[05:47.200 --> 05:47.920]  Baby bear?
[05:48.060 --> 05:48.260]  Like, what?
[05:48.760 --> 05:49.760]  Where are you going?
[05:50.340 --> 05:51.140]  I don't know.
[05:51.140 --> 05:51.760]  Where are you going?
[05:52.140 --> 05:52.540]  Just follow.
[05:53.540 --> 05:55.120]  There's a big yellow line.
[05:55.200 --> 05:57.040]  I didn't get the big yellow line.
[05:57.340 --> 05:58.860]  It just appeared for me.
[05:59.220 --> 06:00.200]  You had the dot, surely?
[06:00.480 --> 06:00.880]  Oh, shit.
[06:00.880 --> 06:01.400]  I almost died.
[06:01.500 --> 06:02.440]  No, I didn't have nothing.
[06:03.460 --> 06:04.640]  I ain't got shit.
[06:05.340 --> 06:07.380]  I was just driving on an empty map.
[06:07.960 --> 06:08.800]  Now we're following it.
[06:09.760 --> 06:10.500]  We're taking it there.
[06:10.560 --> 06:13.500]  When you drive on an empty map, you just start running into walls and shit.
[06:13.520 --> 06:13.800]  I'm scared.
[06:13.800 --> 06:16.200]  Why did you guys let the guy with no map drive?
[06:16.360 --> 06:17.540]  Well, this is what happens.
[06:17.840 --> 06:18.120]  That's a good question.
[06:18.200 --> 06:18.240]  In the game.
[06:18.940 --> 06:19.500]  Gavin's right.
[06:19.860 --> 06:22.500]  When Andrew's in charge, it really starts getting hanky.
[06:22.620 --> 06:24.240]  Why didn't they give me the map?
[06:24.360 --> 06:27.840]  If everyone had the map and the pastor's seat, why didn't I get given the map?
[06:28.120 --> 06:30.700]  Well, I didn't have the line, but I had the dot, which was clearly to the left.
[06:30.920 --> 06:31.260]  Yeah, right?
[06:32.160 --> 06:32.800]  Oh, shit.
[06:33.100 --> 06:35.540]  Does that have anything to do with the map, or are you just driving straight?
[06:35.540 --> 06:36.520]  Yeah, I was looking at the map.
[06:36.620 --> 06:37.000]  That's why.
[06:37.160 --> 06:37.260]  Oh, cool.
[06:37.540 --> 06:37.940]  Right on, man.
[06:39.540 --> 06:40.420]  Hey, man, I got a grenade.
[06:42.000 --> 06:42.520]  I threw a grenade.
[06:42.520 --> 06:42.640]  You threw a what?
[06:43.920 --> 06:44.400]  I threw a grenade.
[06:44.800 --> 06:45.420]  I threw a grenade.
[06:45.840 --> 06:47.160]  How do you blow up sticky bombs again?
[06:47.440 --> 06:47.760]  Left.
[06:47.920 --> 06:48.160]  Left.
[06:48.160 --> 06:48.920]  I got it.
[06:48.920 --> 06:49.380]  You found it.
[06:50.620 --> 06:52.480]  So, were you looking at the map that time?
[06:52.660 --> 06:53.440]  No, I just did.
[06:53.600 --> 06:54.680]  Fuck city infrastructure.
[06:54.960 --> 06:56.340]  That was a decided choice.
[06:57.560 --> 06:58.900]  Fuck criminal out here.
[06:59.660 --> 07:02.280]  I've hated that stoplight for years.
[07:03.860 --> 07:05.760]  He's doing a little eco-terrorism.
[07:05.800 --> 07:06.860]  I like it, I like it.
[07:07.040 --> 07:09.320]  I don't like the lights in this district.
[07:10.540 --> 07:11.220]  Yeah, we're almost back.
[07:11.620 --> 07:12.340]  Yeah, we're almost there.
[07:12.420 --> 07:12.720]  This is easy.
[07:12.860 --> 07:13.900]  We've got one chasing us.
[07:14.420 --> 07:14.900]  I think we're fine.
[07:15.400 --> 07:17.800]  Man, they're the worst security team in the world.
[07:18.080 --> 07:18.140]  I think we're fine.
[07:18.140 --> 07:20.640]  I think they're looking at my sticky bomb and backing off.
[07:20.780 --> 07:21.360]  Well, you missed it.
[07:22.120 --> 07:26.980]  You guys know how that dude killed the CEO because he was upset about healthcare?
[07:27.440 --> 07:27.640]  Yeah.
[07:28.420 --> 07:30.560]  Imagine if you cared that much about lights.
[07:30.820 --> 07:33.980]  Like, what if you started a group of people that were like, if you showed up and you didn't
[07:33.980 --> 07:37.540]  like the lights in a town, you just started killing the people in charge until they brought
[07:37.540 --> 07:38.420]  incandescence back.
[07:39.140 --> 07:41.500]  Oh, I thought you were going to say you could start shooting out the lights and didn't realize
[07:41.500 --> 07:43.160]  you would just also murder the light people.
[07:43.460 --> 07:44.900]  Yeah, no, you're just like, yeah.
[07:45.740 --> 07:46.460]  Was that the heist?
[07:46.820 --> 07:47.280]  Was that it?
[07:47.280 --> 07:49.420]  No, that's step one of the heist.
[07:49.540 --> 07:50.320]  We secured the armor.
[07:50.580 --> 07:53.240]  Man, that went way smoother than the usual step one of heists.
[07:54.420 --> 07:55.460]  Andrew's on the computer now.
[07:55.580 --> 07:57.040]  Ooh, you got guns and stuff in here.
[07:57.260 --> 07:59.480]  Are you playing computer right now, Andrew?
[07:59.880 --> 08:00.900]  I'm playing computer right now.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.900]  I'm playing I Spy, you know, the cereal box game.
[08:04.380 --> 08:04.600]  Oh.
[08:05.020 --> 08:06.000]  Did you buy this place?
[08:06.620 --> 08:06.840]  Yeah.
[08:07.180 --> 08:08.820]  This is just Lester's place, isn't it?
[08:08.820 --> 08:09.880]  It's just Lester's place, isn't it?
[08:09.940 --> 08:10.100]  Yeah.
[08:10.500 --> 08:11.060]  Oh, he killed Lester.
[08:11.060 --> 08:12.200]  I had to buy a garment factory.
[08:12.980 --> 08:15.140]  I need to go to, uh, ammunition.
[08:15.140 --> 08:17.500]  Are we going somewhere?
[08:18.440 --> 08:22.320]  You just said you were going to ammunition, but at the same time, we have a big yellow indicator.
[08:22.840 --> 08:23.100]  We do?
[08:23.260 --> 08:23.380]  Where?
[08:23.500 --> 08:24.840]  We can hit up an ammunition on the way.
[08:25.240 --> 08:25.600]  That's true.
[08:25.700 --> 08:26.520]  It's right across the street.
[08:26.800 --> 08:27.360]  Yeah, it is.
[08:28.780 --> 08:33.960]  If you guys have time left over after you complete the mission, you should try to shoot the hood off a car and surf on it.
[08:34.380 --> 08:34.740]  Yeah.
[08:35.640 --> 08:36.380]  I saw that clip.
[08:39.720 --> 08:40.740]  Hey, don't mind us.
[08:41.160 --> 08:43.500]  I need some armor because I used it all on the heist.
[08:43.500 --> 08:46.520]  I need something that will fix these bullet holes in my back.
[08:47.220 --> 08:48.240]  Oh, you do?
[08:49.560 --> 08:50.540]  Who's that?
[08:51.740 --> 08:53.020]  Oh, that guy came here to p-
[08:53.020 --> 08:53.340]  Ow!
[08:53.720 --> 08:56.120]  This is mine!
[08:58.740 --> 09:00.560]  What the heck?
[09:03.600 --> 09:05.120]  That was awesome!
[09:14.520 --> 09:14.960]  Oh, shit.
[09:15.620 --> 09:16.840]  That was pretty cool, man.
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.120]  I punched his helmet off.
[09:19.120 --> 09:20.000]  Oh, shit.
[09:21.800 --> 09:23.760]  That's like an M16 thing for sale?
[09:24.360 --> 09:25.240]  Has that not always been there?
[09:27.700 --> 09:28.820]  Some of this stuff is different.
[09:29.080 --> 09:30.180]  What happened?
[09:32.000 --> 09:32.860]  What happened?
[09:33.140 --> 09:35.060]  Nick drove the car through the doors.
[09:35.400 --> 09:35.680]  Oh, Nick!
[09:36.060 --> 09:38.440]  I didn't know it would stop you from buying things.
[09:38.540 --> 09:40.620]  Dude, you're such a mess. What is going on?
[09:40.620 --> 09:42.100]  Get in here, Gavin!
[09:42.500 --> 09:44.320]  You locked the store down, dude!
[09:44.820 --> 09:47.140]  How about this, Nick? Why don't you hit me as hard as you can
[09:47.140 --> 09:48.560]  and see if I land by the cash register?
[09:48.740 --> 09:49.500]  Ooh, that's a good idea.
[09:53.020 --> 09:54.960]  Ow, he shot the door and it hit me in the back.
[09:57.120 --> 09:57.480]  No!
[09:58.480 --> 09:59.040]  Get in!
[10:00.220 --> 10:01.120]  One more time.
[10:02.960 --> 10:04.760]  Why would it work on the second?
[10:04.760 --> 10:05.900]  Oh, he's gonna shoot us! Get in!
[10:06.560 --> 10:08.820]  Gavin, get in!
[10:09.800 --> 10:11.580]  Just get in the car.
[10:11.920 --> 10:13.260]  Can you see what that one video
[10:13.260 --> 10:14.800]  I was telling you about was three and a half hours?
[10:15.180 --> 10:16.420]  That wasn't my fault.
[10:16.780 --> 10:18.660]  It was both of these.
[10:18.760 --> 10:20.820]  There was one complication that I did.
[10:21.840 --> 10:23.140]  He did a complication?
[10:23.800 --> 10:25.560]  How many complications
[10:25.560 --> 10:27.200]  do you think just occurred, Nick?
[10:27.800 --> 10:28.300]  I don't know, two?
[10:29.320 --> 10:30.500]  Where are my bombs gone?
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.100]  I would agree with that.
[10:36.360 --> 10:36.840]  What?
[10:37.100 --> 10:38.440]  One complication.
[10:38.640 --> 10:40.200]  Is that inaccurate? Excuse me?
[10:43.400 --> 10:44.440]  I need to wait for my door
[10:44.440 --> 10:46.180]  to be knocked off so I can use bombs again.
[10:47.460 --> 10:48.080]  Oh, that's right.
[10:48.520 --> 10:50.720]  Only two complications, many minor
[10:50.720 --> 10:51.480]  inconveniences.
[10:51.920 --> 10:55.040]  I would say the one was a major one.
[10:57.320 --> 10:58.900]  Hey, listen. Blame the UI.
[11:02.260 --> 11:02.600]  And me.
[11:02.600 --> 11:03.800]  Mostly the UI.
[11:04.840 --> 11:10.460]  They called and told us
[11:10.460 --> 11:13.420]  we're going to this lockup and we have to steal more stuff?
[11:14.000 --> 11:14.640]  I believe so.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.560]  I think we're getting all the gear
[11:16.560 --> 11:18.220]  to take on whatever we got in.
[11:18.560 --> 11:20.520]  What are these?
[11:20.580 --> 11:22.260]  What are these heists?
[11:22.680 --> 11:25.020]  They're just very short
[11:25.020 --> 11:26.220]  bursts
[11:27.000 --> 11:27.380]  of heists?
[11:27.500 --> 11:30.760]  Short burst missions where you're collecting stuff
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.500]  and then stealing something or doing some task.
[11:34.140 --> 11:34.460]  Huh.
[11:34.800 --> 11:37.300]  But not having lives associated
[11:37.300 --> 11:38.660]  with it is very interesting
[11:38.660 --> 11:40.900]  because that's been, I think,
[11:40.920 --> 11:42.280]  notoriously our hang up.
[11:42.740 --> 11:45.340]  I bet they had a bunch of pieces
[11:45.340 --> 11:47.020]  of heists on a whiteboard and they couldn't
[11:47.020 --> 11:49.200]  figure out what to do with them so they created mini heists
[11:49.880 --> 11:51.760]  as a way to rotate them all in.
[11:51.900 --> 11:52.360]  I think you're totally right.
[11:54.080 --> 11:55.400]  I'm being 100% serious
[11:55.400 --> 11:55.800]  when I say it.
[11:55.800 --> 11:57.420]  I think you're absolutely right.
[11:57.420 --> 11:59.060]  I think you're absolutely right.
[12:00.220 --> 12:00.620]  Woohoo!
[12:02.040 --> 12:02.740]  Good drift between.
[12:03.620 --> 12:06.200]  Yeah, this one, once we do it, is worth, like, 300,000.
[12:07.020 --> 12:07.760]  The, uh,
[12:07.960 --> 12:09.960]  the rotating weekly one
[12:09.960 --> 12:11.720]  is worth, like,
[12:11.800 --> 12:12.480]  twice the amount.
[12:12.840 --> 12:15.940]  And that's how much Gavin spends on ammo?
[12:16.120 --> 12:16.520]  Is that right?
[12:17.300 --> 12:18.060]  I believe so.
[12:18.460 --> 12:22.060]  I almost bought a gun for 336 grand, but then it blew up the shop or something.
[12:22.120 --> 12:22.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:24.560 --> 12:25.960]  I love the idea of calling
[12:25.960 --> 12:28.100]  these heists the whiteboard dregs.
[12:30.020 --> 12:30.900]  Not dregs,
[12:30.920 --> 12:32.200]  just pieces that didn't go together.
[12:32.420 --> 12:34.300]  Yeah, dregs.
[12:35.100 --> 12:35.360]  Sure.
[12:36.220 --> 12:36.580]  Okay.
[12:38.020 --> 12:40.280]  He really likes the word. It doesn't matter if it fits or not.
[12:40.620 --> 12:41.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:41.680 --> 12:44.180]  We're just going right to this silo stuff?
[12:44.640 --> 12:45.920]  Yeah, man, we gotta get the pass key.
[12:46.080 --> 12:46.600]  It's our priority.
[12:49.360 --> 12:49.800]  So...
[12:50.460 --> 12:51.380]  Let's take a look.
[12:54.280 --> 12:55.160]  Oh, shit.
[12:56.600 --> 12:57.260]  Take a look.
[12:57.260 --> 12:58.540]  Look for the NCO on site.
[12:59.060 --> 12:59.380]  Okay.
[12:59.740 --> 13:00.500]  Take out the NCO.
[13:01.340 --> 13:03.780]  Do you guys know what an NCO is?
[13:03.960 --> 13:04.840]  Oh, my God.
[13:06.060 --> 13:06.720]  But I'm dead.
[13:08.760 --> 13:09.560]  The NCO is dead.
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.940]  I think I took out the NCO.
[13:11.660 --> 13:12.120]  No, it was me.
[13:14.540 --> 13:15.440]  No, it wasn't.
[13:16.020 --> 13:16.500]  It said me.
[13:17.180 --> 13:18.140]  Did you get it?
[13:18.740 --> 13:19.760]  Here we go.
[13:20.020 --> 13:20.400]  Got it.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.280]  Now what?
[13:24.260 --> 13:26.020]  Break into the military lockup.
[13:26.420 --> 13:29.320]  You guys just killed a working man, by the way.
[13:29.440 --> 13:30.500]  Oh, Jesus.
[13:30.860 --> 13:32.320]  Nick, did you do that, too?
[13:32.480 --> 13:34.080]  Get in here!
[13:34.600 --> 13:35.260]  I'm in.
[13:35.300 --> 13:36.780]  Jesus Christ.
[13:37.860 --> 13:40.980]  We're just blowing away a bunch of army guys?
[13:41.300 --> 13:42.120]  Yeah, looks like it.
[13:42.320 --> 13:43.060]  I feel bad.
[13:44.180 --> 13:45.460]  Can I drive that?
[13:46.660 --> 13:47.140]  Damn.
[13:48.340 --> 13:49.720]  Let's steal the vehicle.
[13:53.020 --> 13:53.880]  Oh, okay.
[13:53.980 --> 13:54.380]  Oh, God.
[13:55.520 --> 13:56.580]  Alright, Andrew, I'm with you.
[13:58.620 --> 13:59.100]  Okay.
[13:59.440 --> 14:00.040]  What are we stealing?
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.280]  Oh, um...
[14:03.280 --> 14:06.860]  Now we're going to drive this out and run right into Nick's car.
[14:07.400 --> 14:07.960]  Here we go.
[14:08.380 --> 14:10.040]  I didn't park the goddamn thing.
[14:10.420 --> 14:10.960]  Oh, no, we're good.
[14:11.300 --> 14:13.700]  Oh, that was so nice. That was so polite.
[14:13.700 --> 14:14.740]  Where are we going to go?
[14:15.580 --> 14:16.720]  I don't have a marker yet.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.400]  No, no, there's no marker yet.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.580]  Is this thing mission critical, Gavin?
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.420]  If there's not a marker, I think you have to drive into a building or a wall, right?
[14:26.100 --> 14:26.940]  Marked location.
[14:27.560 --> 14:29.440]  Let's see if I can set one.
[14:30.240 --> 14:30.760]  Shoot him, Nick!
[14:31.340 --> 14:31.780]  You got it!
[14:32.800 --> 14:33.700]  Oh, no, our armor!
[14:33.820 --> 14:35.060]  Do you have that on you, Andrew?
[14:35.200 --> 14:35.280]  Yep.
[14:37.860 --> 14:38.180]  Cool.
[14:39.940 --> 14:40.380]  Cool.
[14:41.900 --> 14:43.500]  Don't worry, we're going to be okay.
[14:44.160 --> 14:44.780]  Guys, way up!
[14:45.340 --> 14:46.220]  No, just pick it up.
[14:46.360 --> 14:47.020]  Just catch up.
[14:47.660 --> 14:48.280]  Yeah, go fast.
[14:48.540 --> 14:50.500]  Is that you throwing the sticky bombs, Nick?
[14:50.840 --> 14:51.280]  Yeah.
[14:52.440 --> 14:52.880]  Cool.
[14:55.700 --> 14:57.280]  You should call them Nicky bombs.
[14:58.100 --> 14:59.200]  I love it!
[15:00.060 --> 15:01.160]  That's free. You can have that.
[15:01.460 --> 15:01.960]  Oh, thank you.
[15:02.340 --> 15:03.680]  What was that explosion?
[15:04.400 --> 15:07.740]  I think it was probably some Nicky bombs.
[15:07.800 --> 15:08.180]  Whoa!
[15:09.040 --> 15:10.220]  What was that?
[15:10.480 --> 15:13.180]  It was like a cougar or something.
[15:13.900 --> 15:14.580]  Should we go this way?
[15:15.200 --> 15:15.340]  Yeah.
[15:16.460 --> 15:19.280]  Did you guys not lay down a path?
[15:20.820 --> 15:21.640]  What path?
[15:21.940 --> 15:23.080]  What are you talking about?
[15:23.220 --> 15:26.560]  I would like to remind you both that Nick has a hard out.
[15:28.560 --> 15:29.520]  Yeah, but...
[15:29.520 --> 15:30.480]  In like 40 minutes.
[15:30.680 --> 15:30.960]  Yeah.
[15:30.960 --> 15:31.860]  Oh!
[15:33.090 --> 15:33.380]  30.
[15:34.060 --> 15:37.280]  Oh, that was cool.
[15:37.680 --> 15:38.060]  We were skating.
[15:38.520 --> 15:39.900]  We're on the move. We're doing great.
[15:40.220 --> 15:41.460]  We're doing fantastic.
[15:41.460 --> 15:43.360]  We're on the move.
[15:43.860 --> 15:47.920]  I'm also getting so much XP just riding in the car with you.
[15:48.080 --> 15:48.660]  Oh, that's great.
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.680]  He got out!
[15:50.980 --> 15:51.700]  He got out!
[15:52.420 --> 15:54.480]  I'm going to have a look at the map.
[15:54.920 --> 15:55.440]  Okay.
[15:58.640 --> 15:59.800]  They are...
[15:59.800 --> 16:01.280]  They just passed the dinosaur.
[16:01.660 --> 16:03.320]  I forgot the dinosaur was in the game.
[16:03.320 --> 16:04.840]  I didn't even notice the dinosaur.
[16:05.440 --> 16:06.620]  We went another way.
[16:08.160 --> 16:10.180]  We went the way into the city
[16:10.180 --> 16:11.560]  so that way we can go to the
[16:12.140 --> 16:13.160]  mission end.
[16:13.440 --> 16:15.140]  And they went and saw the dinosaur.
[16:15.620 --> 16:16.920]  Is the stash all in the city?
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.680]  There's a yellow...
[16:19.680 --> 16:20.560]  He's driving.
[16:21.480 --> 16:24.300]  So Nick is the passenger and can set...
[16:24.300 --> 16:25.360]  Oh, yeah. I got you.
[16:26.240 --> 16:27.740]  Nick is Nicky Bombing.
[16:27.740 --> 16:29.940]  Yes, he is.
[16:30.400 --> 16:31.940]  He's definitely Nicky Bombing.
[16:32.400 --> 16:32.580]  Yeah.
[16:33.700 --> 16:35.140]  Okay, Gavin, this is an interesting...
[16:35.140 --> 16:37.280]  You're not going to make it up that hill, man.
[16:37.540 --> 16:39.160]  I'm just trying to go along the hill.
[16:41.920 --> 16:44.340]  Hey, look. It's the site of our greatest...
[16:44.340 --> 16:45.800]  I hope this thing's not top-heavy.
[16:47.000 --> 16:47.520]  Go up!
[16:52.600 --> 16:53.400]  Oh, Gavin!
[16:53.860 --> 16:54.420]  We're fine.
[16:54.420 --> 16:57.220]  What are you doing?
[16:57.700 --> 16:59.280]  Nicky, you better go ahead and call
[16:59.280 --> 17:01.160]  and tell whoever it is you're going to be late.
[17:08.350 --> 17:09.830]  Just load into that meeting.
[17:10.010 --> 17:11.810]  Excuse me one second. Mute. Come back.
[17:16.710 --> 17:19.710]  Well, we did lose those guys.
[17:20.530 --> 17:21.890]  Yeah, that was like a long time ago.
[17:22.350 --> 17:23.350]  No, they came back.
[17:24.190 --> 17:24.850]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[17:25.610 --> 17:26.310]  Looking at the map.
[17:27.630 --> 17:28.630]  I marked it.
[17:28.910 --> 17:29.150]  Yeah.
[17:31.890 --> 17:33.550]  We may have just beat it without them.
[17:34.090 --> 17:34.870]  We might not need them.
[17:35.610 --> 17:37.570]  No, I think our thing's flashing.
[17:38.690 --> 17:39.270]  Maybe, yeah.
[17:39.270 --> 17:40.710]  Maybe this is just a car that was in there.
[17:41.370 --> 17:42.290]  I think you may have just...
[17:42.290 --> 17:44.290]  Because we just have leave the area as a prompt.
[17:45.430 --> 17:47.790]  Well, technically, we've beaten it first then
[17:47.790 --> 17:48.810]  because we already left the area.
[17:48.830 --> 17:50.770]  Yeah, you're very far out of the area.
[17:51.630 --> 17:54.090]  How far out of the area do we need to get?
[17:55.670 --> 17:56.690]  Wait for your...
[17:56.690 --> 17:57.410]  Okay, it's just up here.
[18:03.490 --> 18:04.910]  Good job, Nick and Gav!
[18:05.330 --> 18:05.650]  Thanks!
[18:08.230 --> 18:08.830]  Oh, shit!
[18:09.730 --> 18:10.470]  That looked cool.
[18:10.810 --> 18:11.770]  Hey, do you think I can blow us up?
[18:13.090 --> 18:13.730]  I think you just did.
[18:19.060 --> 18:20.320]  Oh, we don't have to go far at all.
[18:20.860 --> 18:20.980]  No.
[18:21.480 --> 18:22.380]  It's just right behind us.
[18:24.200 --> 18:25.280]  Gonna start up the next one.
[18:25.760 --> 18:26.200]  Ha!
[18:32.100 --> 18:33.240]  Let me get in the back.
[18:36.260 --> 18:37.880]  We should pick up the crew in this.
[18:38.220 --> 18:38.460]  Yeah!
[18:39.280 --> 18:40.840]  Hey, Andrew and Eric, we got a vehicle.
[18:41.320 --> 18:44.040]  Cool. Yeah, we're gonna start the next mission.
[18:45.280 --> 18:45.720]  Okay.
[18:46.340 --> 18:47.020]  We'll come pick you up.
[18:48.380 --> 18:49.660]  Andrew's playing on computer again.
[18:52.480 --> 18:54.640]  I gotta spy all the things with my eye.
[18:57.160 --> 18:57.880]  Oh, cop.
[18:57.880 --> 18:58.840]  Oh, boy.
[18:59.280 --> 19:00.040]  Excuse me?
[19:02.100 --> 19:03.240]  Try this again.
[19:03.780 --> 19:06.040]  It said something, but I...
[19:06.040 --> 19:07.560]  But I didn't read it, and I started pressing buttons.
[19:07.820 --> 19:11.780]  Visit Jody's contact inside the music locker at the Diamond Casino and Resort to acquire the key.
[19:11.940 --> 19:12.140]  Okay.
[19:12.620 --> 19:13.840]  We gotta go to the casino, Eric.
[19:14.280 --> 19:15.300]  Let's go to the casino, Andrew.
[19:15.960 --> 19:17.580]  Okay, we're coming.
[19:17.900 --> 19:18.860]  We're on our way.
[19:19.360 --> 19:20.060]  We're on our way.
[19:20.640 --> 19:21.460]  I don't like that.
[19:23.520 --> 19:24.860]  Oh, we have to change freeways, Gavin.
[19:25.920 --> 19:28.020]  Our vehicle just has more fun seats.
[19:28.480 --> 19:29.720]  I mean, we would...
[19:29.720 --> 19:31.420]  I mean, we'll take a ride in your vehicle.
[19:31.560 --> 19:32.340]  It's just...
[19:32.340 --> 19:32.460]  Yeah.
[19:34.020 --> 19:36.540]  Nick sounded like he was ready to get to the casino fast.
[19:37.540 --> 19:38.360]  Where are you?
[19:39.740 --> 19:40.120]  Close.
[19:41.420 --> 19:42.340]  I'm just getting in this car.
[19:43.340 --> 19:43.720]  No!
[19:44.580 --> 19:46.540]  They're less than a half mile from you.
[19:47.340 --> 19:48.480]  We're gonna arrive in style.
[19:49.100 --> 19:50.240]  Yeah, come on. Wait for us.
[19:51.460 --> 19:52.740]  I mean, come pick me up.
[19:52.740 --> 19:54.140]  Okay, we're almost there.
[19:54.360 --> 19:55.860]  Andrew's gonna have the wrong style.
[19:56.380 --> 19:58.820]  Wait a minute. Can we just follow this to the...
[19:58.820 --> 20:00.320]  Fuck me. Okay, nevermind.
[20:00.580 --> 20:01.200]  It's okay. It's alright.
[20:02.300 --> 20:04.740]  How are you guys... How are you still lost?
[20:05.240 --> 20:06.280]  We're just... We're above.
[20:07.140 --> 20:08.760]  I know. I understand.
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.080]  Just take a...
[20:11.080 --> 20:12.020]  Take a spill over the edge.
[20:13.400 --> 20:13.680]  Oh!
[20:15.360 --> 20:16.380]  That was great.
[20:16.560 --> 20:17.500]  I got all of that.
[20:17.560 --> 20:19.200]  That was perfect.
[20:21.960 --> 20:23.760]  Hey, I bet I can launch you through it on this.
[20:25.940 --> 20:26.220]  Alright.
[20:27.560 --> 20:28.220]  Bye, Andrew.
[20:30.260 --> 20:30.540]  Yes!
[20:31.320 --> 20:32.040]  Alright, come on over here.
[20:32.560 --> 20:33.920]  But don't get in the cab. Get in the back.
[20:34.720 --> 20:35.280]  I know.
[20:35.780 --> 20:36.460]  I didn't hit my car.
[20:37.620 --> 20:38.180]  Oh, you did?
[20:38.500 --> 20:38.740]  Yeah.
[20:42.040 --> 20:42.720]  Oh, I missed him.
[20:46.320 --> 20:47.700]  I don't know that it's gonna let me in.
[20:47.700 --> 20:49.820]  Just keep moving him from side to side.
[20:50.080 --> 20:51.220]  There's so many seats.
[20:51.440 --> 20:56.160]  It kept kicking me around to the other side.
[20:56.540 --> 20:58.180]  It just kept moving me
[20:58.180 --> 20:58.940]  to the other side.
[20:59.400 --> 21:00.540]  It kept bullying me.
[21:03.140 --> 21:04.120]  That was weird.
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.600]  How's it going back there?
[21:09.020 --> 21:11.620]  It's good. Good air.
[21:12.520 --> 21:13.340]  Good flappage.
[21:13.760 --> 21:14.820]  Good flappage.
[21:14.820 --> 21:16.780]  So we're taking this to the casino?
[21:17.380 --> 21:17.500]  Yeah.
[21:18.020 --> 21:19.820]  To arrive in style.
[21:20.520 --> 21:23.820]  Do you know what we could do in GTA?
[21:25.420 --> 21:25.780]  What's that?
[21:25.780 --> 21:27.980]  We could make our own snow runner.
[21:29.260 --> 21:31.420]  Because there's all kinds of
[21:31.420 --> 21:32.680]  trucks and trailers
[21:32.680 --> 21:33.800]  that hook up to trucks.
[21:33.920 --> 21:35.400]  You could try to carry a truck
[21:35.400 --> 21:38.800]  with a trailer over Mt. Chiliad
[21:38.800 --> 21:41.480]  and if it tips over you can bring the cargo bob in
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.280]  and that can be the tow hook
[21:43.280 --> 21:45.040]  that helps get it straight and stuff.
[21:45.420 --> 21:47.420]  We could totally invent our own trails
[21:47.420 --> 21:49.380]  and paths to go
[21:49.380 --> 21:51.960]  and try to get cargo from one side to the other.
[21:52.240 --> 21:53.360]  And there's some pickups that
[21:53.360 --> 21:55.280]  tow a boat as well.
[21:55.820 --> 21:57.480]  Yeah, exactly. We could tow a boat.
[21:57.620 --> 21:58.480]  Oh my god, dude.
[21:58.840 --> 22:00.560]  We could boat down Chiliad.
[22:02.120 --> 22:03.420]  Now we're talking.
[22:03.760 --> 22:04.560]  I think that's awesome.
[22:05.200 --> 22:07.880]  But you gotta get the boat up Chiliad to take it down Chiliad.
[22:08.240 --> 22:08.980]  I love it.
[22:09.760 --> 22:10.260]  Me too.
[22:10.260 --> 22:12.860]  It's like delivering the props for the let's play
[22:12.860 --> 22:14.340]  is the first video
[22:14.340 --> 22:15.580]  and then the next video is the let's play.
[22:16.820 --> 22:18.040]  Oh, cops are on us. Cool.
[22:19.300 --> 22:20.240]  Did you know this
[22:20.840 --> 22:21.640]  happened here?
[22:23.480 --> 22:23.920]  Well...
[22:24.660 --> 22:26.820]  It's a boat and I ran over those people.
[22:29.360 --> 22:29.800]  Anyway...
[22:29.800 --> 22:30.920]  Nick, what would you qualify
[22:30.920 --> 22:31.520]  this as?
[22:32.400 --> 22:33.160]  A complication?
[22:33.620 --> 22:34.500]  Oh, interesting.
[22:35.220 --> 22:36.780]  I would say it was arriving in style.
[22:40.780 --> 22:41.840]  Arriving in style
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.820]  can be complicated.
[22:43.940 --> 22:45.320]  We gotta find
[22:45.320 --> 22:46.140]  the person.
[22:47.160 --> 22:48.840]  They're in a music section or something.
[22:49.420 --> 22:49.820]  I don't know.
[22:50.300 --> 22:51.220]  Did you guys go in the casino?
[22:52.020 --> 22:52.240]  Yeah.
[22:54.060 --> 22:55.840]  Bringing us all in, I believe.
[22:58.100 --> 22:59.840]  It just takes a really long time.
[22:59.940 --> 23:01.060]  The guy holds the door for you.
[23:01.100 --> 23:01.540]  It takes forever.
[23:03.100 --> 23:04.900]  I'm gonna get my free chips
[23:04.900 --> 23:06.500]  and then I'm gonna spin the wheel.
[23:07.040 --> 23:07.520]  Chips?
[23:09.460 --> 23:11.100]  You're gonna spin the wheel?
[23:11.660 --> 23:11.740]  Yeah.
[23:12.920 --> 23:13.400]  Oh.
[23:15.500 --> 23:16.940]  I've never been to the casino
[23:16.940 --> 23:18.900]  here. Now I'm sitting through
[23:18.900 --> 23:20.060]  all the casino stuff.
[23:23.340 --> 23:25.000]  I want a pretty sweet
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  car for nothing once.
[23:26.680 --> 23:28.160]  I only want clothing.
[23:28.520 --> 23:30.440]  I think I remember Jack spinning this and winning something.
[23:30.880 --> 23:32.000]  Yeah, I think he won a car too.
[23:32.900 --> 23:33.500]  I want a car.
[23:34.720 --> 23:36.120]  I want to not watch
[23:36.120 --> 23:38.300]  a cutscene. I want to play the game.
[23:38.820 --> 23:39.140]  Well,
[23:39.740 --> 23:40.580]  watch the cutscene.
[23:41.040 --> 23:41.980]  I'm spinning the wheel.
[23:43.480 --> 23:45.580]  I'm gonna go meet with our person to get their key.
[23:46.600 --> 23:47.120]  Good luck, Gav.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.580]  What if it lands on Goat's second wheel?
[23:50.660 --> 23:51.140]  Oh no!
[23:54.100 --> 23:54.920]  A shirt!
[23:58.520 --> 23:58.960]  Cool.
[23:59.640 --> 24:01.320]  Alright, my go, maybe.
[24:04.040 --> 24:04.760]  Hell yeah.
[24:05.600 --> 24:07.120]  You ready? Good luck, Nick.
[24:07.500 --> 24:08.160]  Thank you!
[24:15.680 --> 24:17.400]  I'm in a mission. I invited you guys.
[24:18.900 --> 24:20.140]  This one has lives.
[24:20.560 --> 24:22.860]  25,000 chips! Oh shit!
[24:23.620 --> 24:24.600]  Alright, I accept it.
[24:25.680 --> 24:27.260]  I'm trying. I'm still in a
[24:27.260 --> 24:27.800]  cutscene.
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.100]  Loose chain.
[24:31.380 --> 24:32.460]  I'm trapped! It won't let me out!
[24:33.380 --> 24:34.320]  How's that cutscene, Eric?
[24:34.840 --> 24:36.200]  It sucks!
[24:38.040 --> 24:39.540]  I hate this!
[24:39.620 --> 24:41.160]  This is the worst shit
[24:41.160 --> 24:41.980]  in the world.
[24:42.160 --> 24:43.980]  This fucking sucks.
[24:44.140 --> 24:45.900]  Would you consider this to be a complication, Eric?
[24:46.780 --> 24:47.720]  Yeah, definitely.
[24:48.120 --> 24:50.660]  I think this is definitely a complication.
[24:51.280 --> 24:52.740]  I just want to play
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.960]  the video game and it will not let me.
[24:55.200 --> 24:56.720]  What's it like to be the problem for once, Eric?
[24:56.940 --> 24:58.720]  God damn, this sucks shit!
[24:59.500 --> 25:00.720]  The worst part,
[25:00.840 --> 25:02.680]  I'm jamming on every button.
[25:02.920 --> 25:04.380]  Just let me out of here.
[25:04.380 --> 25:06.380]  Stop talking to me, please.
[25:06.560 --> 25:08.040]  God. There's a countdown.
[25:08.960 --> 25:10.300]  Yeah, it dropped us.
[25:11.880 --> 25:12.840]  34, 33,
[25:13.060 --> 25:14.760]  32. You could set your radio to
[25:14.760 --> 25:16.080]  media play. We might be neck and neck.
[25:18.180 --> 25:18.840]  It's kicking
[25:18.840 --> 25:19.920]  me out of the cutscene, hopefully.
[25:21.700 --> 25:22.820]  Don't do that.
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.180]  Yes, yes, yes!
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.280]  I'm in! I'm coming!
[25:26.900 --> 25:27.340]  Oh god!
[25:29.940 --> 25:31.480]  Jesus fucking Christ!
[25:31.720 --> 25:32.540]  Wow, that was exciting.
[25:32.540 --> 25:35.020]  No, it wasn't. That sucked.
[25:35.800 --> 25:37.080]  Break up the party, rescue Tao Chen
[25:37.080 --> 25:38.740]  from a possible kidnapping by bikers.
[25:39.120 --> 25:40.800]  I wonder if you could load episodes of the
[25:40.800 --> 25:43.080]  Regulation podcast into your media player.
[25:43.220 --> 25:43.640]  Media player?
[25:48.240 --> 25:51.020]  I wonder how many video games you can play
[25:51.020 --> 25:51.860]  our podcast in.
[25:52.640 --> 25:54.000]  Ooh, that's cool.
[25:55.460 --> 25:56.500]  Mission failed.
[25:57.060 --> 25:59.140]  Yeah, what happened? It froze on my penis
[25:59.140 --> 26:00.860]  a little bit. I hit skip.
[26:01.480 --> 26:03.040]  Oh, there was a skip button?
[26:03.220 --> 26:03.960]  Oh, thank god.
[26:05.040 --> 26:07.160]  That rocks. It's just frozen
[26:07.160 --> 26:08.540]  though for me. As long as it
[26:09.440 --> 26:10.980]  works. It might just be loading.
[26:11.700 --> 26:13.100]  There's noise. I hear noise.
[26:13.320 --> 26:13.900]  Oh, yay!
[26:15.420 --> 26:16.220]  Alright, boys.
[26:18.920 --> 26:20.720]  Oh no, Andrew! Let's do it.
[26:23.000 --> 26:23.800]  Hop in, Gavin.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.860]  You just did what Eric did.
[26:26.900 --> 26:27.940]  You're doing what...
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.480]  Stop! Gavin!
[26:35.120 --> 26:36.320]  What happened to your
[26:36.320 --> 26:36.920]  army car?
[26:38.140 --> 26:39.340]  It's in the past.
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.360]  I think it got impounded when Nick got all the
[26:42.360 --> 26:43.060]  cops on us.
[26:44.100 --> 26:45.900]  Those three people were in the... alright.
[26:46.300 --> 26:46.640]  Where are you going?
[26:48.240 --> 26:49.580]  Clearly that was not intentional.
[26:50.920 --> 26:51.860]  I think it was intentional.
[26:52.080 --> 26:52.820]  I think you did it on purpose.
[26:57.670 --> 26:58.570]  I missed him.
[26:59.410 --> 27:00.770]  Press Y to open the briefcase.
[27:00.890 --> 27:01.710]  Is the Nicky Bombs ready?
[27:03.550 --> 27:03.750]  What?
[27:05.730 --> 27:07.270]  I was just trying to engage
[27:07.270 --> 27:08.270]  with the thing that you like.
[27:08.590 --> 27:10.070]  That was on me. That was my fault.
[27:10.390 --> 27:10.890]  What did you say?
[27:12.630 --> 27:14.870]  I said, do you want to prep the Nicky Bombs?
[27:15.210 --> 27:16.830]  Yeah, but they don't let me use them in this car.
[27:17.390 --> 27:18.590]  You gotta snap the doors off.
[27:19.990 --> 27:21.330]  Oh, you gotta break the doors
[27:21.330 --> 27:21.650]  for the Nicky Bombs.
[27:23.490 --> 27:25.170]  I almost did. You son of a...
[27:25.170 --> 27:27.630]  I mean, that would have been
[27:27.630 --> 27:29.730]  fully on you. He didn't even lie about what it does.
[27:29.850 --> 27:30.150]  Yeah.
[27:32.070 --> 27:33.610]  That one's more about context,
[27:33.690 --> 27:35.270]  I suppose. Do you remember
[27:35.270 --> 27:37.330]  that game, Sleeping Dogs?
[27:38.070 --> 27:38.310]  Yeah.
[27:39.190 --> 27:41.450]  It was a GTA clone about more
[27:41.450 --> 27:43.710]  hand-to-hand combat. They had a fucking mechanic
[27:43.710 --> 27:45.750]  in it where you could open the car door to bash
[27:45.750 --> 27:47.510]  people with it when you drove down the road.
[27:47.670 --> 27:49.630]  So you could just drive down the road and just fucking
[27:49.630 --> 27:52.050]  pop people as you went. It was so cool.
[27:52.630 --> 27:53.150]  That's cool.
[27:53.150 --> 27:55.250]  That was a fun game. That was a really fun game.
[27:55.290 --> 27:57.170]  It was a great game. I wish they'd make a sequel.
[27:59.810 --> 28:00.690]  I never played it.
[28:01.950 --> 28:03.330]  Didn't Emma Stone or something
[28:03.330 --> 28:04.210]  do a voice in that?
[28:04.890 --> 28:06.110]  She has a very similar role.
[28:08.170 --> 28:09.550]  It was supposed to be like the third
[28:09.550 --> 28:11.530]  true crime game, but then they just got rid
[28:11.530 --> 28:13.170]  of the true crime name.
[28:17.730 --> 28:19.670]  I think they did Streets of New York, Streets of LA
[28:19.670 --> 28:21.030]  and then that was like...
[28:21.030 --> 28:22.630]  I think Streets of Hong Kong or whatever.
[28:24.230 --> 28:24.890]  Here we go!
[28:24.890 --> 28:25.830]  Oh my god!
[28:26.230 --> 28:29.250]  Get out!
[28:39.280 --> 28:41.480]  Nice headshot. Oh damn, blew that up.
[28:43.680 --> 28:44.600]  We can find them.
[28:45.740 --> 28:47.320]  I'm coming with you Nick, I'm right behind you.
[28:50.120 --> 28:50.880]  Good lord.
[28:50.920 --> 28:51.900]  Holy shit!
[28:53.640 --> 28:54.860]  Wow, there's a lot of guys.
[28:54.880 --> 28:56.680]  Oh my god, there's so many.
[28:56.800 --> 28:58.840]  Are they up on the top? Yeah, they must be.
[28:58.840 --> 28:59.440]  Some of them are.
[29:01.400 --> 29:02.040]  Oh shit!
[29:02.640 --> 29:03.520]  They're coming to the side here Nick.
[29:04.400 --> 29:05.120]  Oh, they're coming around.
[29:05.840 --> 29:08.020]  Oh wow, we might have to boogie dude.
[29:08.860 --> 29:10.040]  You go man, you go, I'll cover you.
[29:10.240 --> 29:13.720]  I feel like this game loves a mission in a burned out motel.
[29:14.320 --> 29:14.960]  Oh yeah, it does.
[29:15.340 --> 29:16.140]  Yeah, I've been to this motel.
[29:16.940 --> 29:19.080]  I got hit. I think I got hit with a hammer or something
[29:19.080 --> 29:20.480]  while I was firing the minigun.
[29:20.800 --> 29:21.520]  A hammer?
[29:22.660 --> 29:25.160]  Oh yeah, the one weakness of the minigun when they get in close.
[29:25.560 --> 29:26.960]  That guy came at me with a...
[29:27.800 --> 29:29.320]  Did he have a hammer Nick?
[29:30.160 --> 29:31.260]  No, he had a wrench.
[29:32.080 --> 29:33.200]  Okay, we gotta get out of here.
[29:33.260 --> 29:34.780]  Did he have any of Davin on the wrench?
[29:38.040 --> 29:40.040]  We got people coming from where we came in.
[29:40.560 --> 29:42.620]  Okay, so what's the plan here?
[29:42.740 --> 29:42.960]  Do we get to the car?
[29:42.960 --> 29:44.960]  I'm just gonna escort this person that's with me.
[29:45.360 --> 29:47.780]  Alright, F this.
[29:48.340 --> 29:49.440]  Oh, we need cars.
[29:49.560 --> 29:50.360]  We need some of the vehicles.
[29:50.620 --> 29:51.640]  Yeah, mine's still fine.
[29:52.240 --> 29:56.180]  Oh, why are you taking an unarmored vehicle?
[29:57.260 --> 29:59.060]  Do you think he likes box trucks?
[30:00.380 --> 30:01.160]  I don't think so.
[30:01.180 --> 30:02.600]  I think he likes the mini hearse.
[30:03.020 --> 30:03.260]  Okay.
[30:05.400 --> 30:06.380]  I'm in. Let's go.
[30:06.620 --> 30:07.380]  We're getting him out.
[30:07.440 --> 30:07.780]  You go.
[30:09.960 --> 30:10.540]  Davin, wait.
[30:14.420 --> 30:15.180]  Get in there.
[30:15.480 --> 30:16.220]  Get in.
[30:17.120 --> 30:19.080]  You hit me with the door.
[30:19.500 --> 30:20.920]  Well, now it's off so you can throw bombs.
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.460]  Oh sweet, now I'm back in.
[30:23.480 --> 30:24.620]  Oh, we got people.
[30:25.580 --> 30:26.480]  Didn't see that coming.
[30:26.560 --> 30:27.280]  Well, let me throw bombs.
[30:29.120 --> 30:31.020]  Well, oh well.
[30:31.660 --> 30:32.440]  I don't think you...
[30:32.440 --> 30:34.240]  Did you intend for the door to fly off like that?
[30:35.200 --> 30:36.040]  I'm shooting him.
[30:36.140 --> 30:37.260]  You're doing great, Andrew. Keep it going.
[30:37.540 --> 30:38.980]  I'm trying my best. You're doing good too.
[30:42.180 --> 30:42.940]  No, okay.
[30:43.100 --> 30:43.740]  Could have done better.
[30:45.160 --> 30:46.540]  I'm at the drift. I didn't.
[30:46.780 --> 30:47.500]  Maybe not good.
[30:49.540 --> 30:49.940]  Hey guys.
[30:50.660 --> 30:54.220]  Oh, we should probably run interference.
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.440]  Gavin, they're right behind him.
[30:55.760 --> 30:56.800]  Yeah, if you want to go behind me.
[30:57.160 --> 30:58.720]  Oh, they're in front too.
[31:00.400 --> 31:01.200]  They're everywhere.
[31:01.680 --> 31:02.740]  Just avoid.
[31:02.960 --> 31:03.120]  Oh.
[31:06.640 --> 31:08.380]  Look at the mouse in the back of the van.
[31:08.920 --> 31:09.780]  I'm the mouse.
[31:10.020 --> 31:10.580]  Eric, jump on.
[31:12.760 --> 31:14.300]  He actually gave us a little boost.
[31:14.440 --> 31:14.820]  That was nice.
[31:16.840 --> 31:17.540]  Jump, Eric.
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.480]  Don't look at me.
[31:21.480 --> 31:22.460]  Don't look at me.
[31:22.460 --> 31:23.080]  Nice!
[31:26.080 --> 31:27.140]  You peed me.
[31:27.380 --> 31:28.400]  Sorry, you peed me.
[31:28.460 --> 31:29.720]  I was trying to hit that bikeman.
[31:31.320 --> 31:32.000]  Oh, shit.
[31:32.300 --> 31:34.140]  The car hit the bike and flipped.
[31:36.240 --> 31:37.460]  Will you die?
[31:37.680 --> 31:38.120]  Thank you.
[31:38.740 --> 31:39.000]  Oh.
[31:39.120 --> 31:42.280]  Oh, they're coming.
[31:43.860 --> 31:44.620]  Go to hell.
[31:46.920 --> 31:47.600]  Oh, what happened?
[31:47.760 --> 31:48.300]  Oh, it's just a bike.
[31:48.360 --> 31:49.060]  Oh, shit.
[31:49.840 --> 31:51.540]  Keep giving us that speed.
[31:52.540 --> 31:54.140]  Give us a little push.
[31:54.280 --> 31:55.320]  Oh, shit!
[31:55.720 --> 31:56.200]  Nice!
[31:57.800 --> 31:59.700]  Eric, make the celebratory transfer.
[32:01.080 --> 32:01.600]  Okay.
[32:05.980 --> 32:07.920]  Wow, that's the worst roadblock
[32:07.920 --> 32:08.420]  in the world.
[32:22.350 --> 32:23.870]  Damn it.
[32:27.290 --> 32:28.470]  We almost got him.
[32:29.450 --> 32:30.490]  Almost there, guys.
[32:31.230 --> 32:31.890]  Way to go.
[32:32.290 --> 32:33.470]  We only lost one life.
[32:33.470 --> 32:34.510]  That's fantastic.
[32:37.730 --> 32:38.970]  Right in the back, baby.
[32:41.670 --> 32:42.850]  No, don't leave me here.
[32:45.570 --> 32:47.490]  I think you gotta go around the side.
[32:48.010 --> 32:48.170]  Yep.
[32:48.750 --> 32:50.670]  You gotta make that turn.
[32:51.390 --> 32:51.610]  Nope.
[32:53.170 --> 32:54.210]  Whose car is this?
[32:54.210 --> 32:54.790]  Is this my car?
[32:57.950 --> 32:58.610]  There you go.
[32:59.710 --> 33:00.110]  Nice!
[33:00.790 --> 33:01.670]  There you go, boys.
[33:01.790 --> 33:02.510]  We did it.
[33:03.410 --> 33:04.250]  Okay, we got him back.
[33:05.110 --> 33:07.630]  Now we should be able to do the actual mission.
[33:08.010 --> 33:08.890]  Heist actual.
[33:12.010 --> 33:12.150]  What?
[33:14.670 --> 33:16.090]  It wasn't a good party at all, he said.
[33:18.690 --> 33:20.490]  I don't remember if this is a
[33:20.990 --> 33:23.030]  part of the casino heist.
[33:23.030 --> 33:25.370]  They just looped into this mission.
[33:26.070 --> 33:26.550]  Oh, interesting.
[33:27.470 --> 33:28.210]  Not sure.
[33:28.790 --> 33:30.070]  I haven't done those in a while.
[33:33.230 --> 33:35.090]  Yeah, what if we think we're doing the new heist,
[33:35.150 --> 33:36.730]  but we're actually doing an 8 year old heist?
[33:37.530 --> 33:39.170]  I'm so excited for the comments
[33:39.170 --> 33:41.170]  if that's the case. I cannot wait.
[33:42.990 --> 33:43.550]  That was fun.
[33:46.050 --> 33:47.010]  No complication.
[33:54.010 --> 33:55.630]  I really liked Eric's transfer.
[33:56.870 --> 33:57.510]  Yeah, it was
[33:57.510 --> 33:58.970]  a celebration, you know?
[34:02.670 --> 34:03.790]  Wow, that's initializing
[34:03.790 --> 34:04.590]  for a long time.
[34:04.890 --> 34:06.170]  I reckon you half-assed the transfer.
[34:07.690 --> 34:09.150]  No, it was a whole ass.
[34:09.530 --> 34:10.030]  It was good.
[34:10.310 --> 34:11.430]  What do you guys think Geoff is doing?
[34:12.490 --> 34:13.470]  I'm watching you guys.
[34:14.210 --> 34:15.030]  Do you think he's fishing?
[34:15.250 --> 34:15.870]  I hope so.
[34:16.530 --> 34:18.650]  What are you talking about? I'm sitting here watching you guys.
[34:18.650 --> 34:20.170]  I'm just curious if you're fishing.
[34:20.350 --> 34:21.670]  Do you think Eric half-assed the transfer?
[34:21.950 --> 34:23.210]  Why would I be fishing?
[34:23.570 --> 34:26.650]  I'm watching this with bated breath.
[34:34.470 --> 34:36.250]  Yeah, get in the back of the pickup.
[34:36.450 --> 34:38.730]  Oh, it wouldn't let me. Hold on, let me try.
[34:44.530 --> 34:46.330]  If I was fishing,
[34:46.910 --> 34:48.330]  it would be totally smart
[34:48.330 --> 34:49.870]  because I would have already made about $1,700
[34:49.870 --> 34:51.470]  while I'm sitting there watching you guys.
[34:51.710 --> 34:52.470]  That's what I'm talking about.
[34:54.010 --> 34:54.770]  I'm not doing that.
[34:55.430 --> 34:57.390]  I'm not trying to get my next bait.
[34:58.030 --> 34:59.790]  Are we waiting for a phone call, Andrew?
[35:00.130 --> 35:02.250]  I'm driving back to the garment factory.
[35:03.390 --> 35:04.410]  Waiting for a nibble.
[35:04.490 --> 35:05.390]  I mean a phone call.
[35:06.650 --> 35:07.390]  Oh, I'm in.
[35:08.570 --> 35:09.170]  Keep going.
[35:09.170 --> 35:09.710]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:15.110 --> 35:16.150]  Alright, let's try again.
[35:16.410 --> 35:18.030]  I'm going to walk a little bit.
[35:19.010 --> 35:20.890]  Every time you fall, I'll just break
[35:20.890 --> 35:21.810]  and you'll come back in.
[35:25.470 --> 35:26.710]  I can pick you up.
[35:26.710 --> 35:26.770]  Fuck!
[35:38.500 --> 35:40.200]  So this doesn't hurt you at all?
[35:40.860 --> 35:41.820]  I don't know, let's find out.
[35:41.900 --> 35:43.000]  Here, try one more time.
[35:43.900 --> 35:45.900]  If I drive backwards, you'll surely just...
[35:46.420 --> 35:47.960]  Yeah, I'll just fall into the...
[35:47.960 --> 35:48.320]  Fuck!
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.060]  Andrew, are you playing computer?
[35:53.560 --> 35:54.340]  I'm playing computer.
[35:54.340 --> 35:55.600]  Oh, no!
[35:57.300 --> 35:57.740]  What's wrong?
[36:01.020 --> 36:02.920]  We gotta go back to the casino.
[36:03.280 --> 36:03.860]  You should.
[36:04.900 --> 36:06.400]  We just did...
[36:06.400 --> 36:08.360]  Alright, run me over. Let's see if that hurts you.
[36:08.360 --> 36:09.420]  Run me over, full speed.
[36:09.940 --> 36:11.620]  We just did a random...
[36:11.620 --> 36:13.640]  We did a casino heist mission.
[36:14.940 --> 36:16.140]  That was unrelated.
[36:16.520 --> 36:19.020]  That was just part of the casino heist.
[36:19.020 --> 36:21.520]  Jack, you saw these for three and a half hours?
[36:23.280 --> 36:24.840]  Turns out there was a complication.
[36:25.520 --> 36:27.280]  Well, we had a marker to do it
[36:27.280 --> 36:29.660]  that suddenly went away when Nick drove over
[36:29.660 --> 36:31.520]  everybody at the front lobby.
[36:31.820 --> 36:33.620]  So I just went into the casino
[36:33.620 --> 36:34.620]  to try to solve it.
[36:35.940 --> 36:37.820]  But that was not the answer.
[36:39.260 --> 36:40.720]  So you're in charge, right?
[36:44.420 --> 36:46.080]  Let's just not drive over
[36:46.080 --> 36:47.880]  everybody at the front of the casino.
[36:47.880 --> 36:50.300]  You're saying that because Nick drove it over everyone
[36:50.300 --> 36:51.680]  we just did a different mission?
[36:52.460 --> 36:52.620]  Yes.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.860]  Because there was no longer a marker
[36:56.860 --> 36:58.500]  so I just went into the casino
[36:58.500 --> 36:59.960]  and then I had a mission marker.
[37:00.200 --> 37:02.160]  And I thought, oh, this is the mission.
[37:02.720 --> 37:04.020]  So I went and I did it
[37:04.020 --> 37:07.060]  and it's just part of starting the casino heist.
[37:08.780 --> 37:11.060]  Which you guys are now one mission ahead on.
[37:11.160 --> 37:11.540]  Congratulations.
[37:12.380 --> 37:14.580]  Listen, we got the ball rolling on the casino.
[37:15.080 --> 37:17.080]  Geoff, can I come fishing with you?
[37:17.080 --> 37:19.320]  Yeah, dude. I just got some small krill.
[37:19.420 --> 37:20.880]  It's pretty nice out here.
[37:23.700 --> 37:26.020]  You're never allowed to be in charge.
[37:26.900 --> 37:29.220]  How is it my fault? It's Nick's fault.
[37:29.520 --> 37:31.120]  There might have been a complication.
[37:33.100 --> 37:34.860]  Okay, here's the marker once again.
[37:35.180 --> 37:36.720]  Stop trying to kill people.
[37:37.120 --> 37:38.300]  Oh, we're in each other.
[37:39.620 --> 37:41.160]  Andrew, it's inside the casino.
[37:42.080 --> 37:42.880]  Oh, stop!
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.420]  Is it not the music thing?
[37:46.720 --> 37:47.640]  It's the music thing.
[37:47.720 --> 37:48.640]  I don't think it's in the casino.
[37:48.780 --> 37:50.060]  I think it's to the left of it.
[37:51.760 --> 37:52.440]  Here we go.
[37:54.060 --> 37:55.220]  Oh, the music thing.
[37:55.300 --> 37:56.620]  Yeah, that's why we missed it.
[37:59.760 --> 38:00.760]  And no other reason.
[38:00.820 --> 38:01.420]  Okay, going in.
[38:03.860 --> 38:05.800]  He just drove to the wrong door.
[38:05.980 --> 38:06.700]  Enter with...
[38:07.280 --> 38:07.680]  No!
[38:08.260 --> 38:09.100]  What happened?
[38:10.420 --> 38:12.520]  We were driving to the right door.
[38:12.760 --> 38:14.480]  Then the marker went away.
[38:16.520 --> 38:17.900]  Oh, dude, this might be my...
[38:17.900 --> 38:19.720]  Oh, this is my kind of place, baby!
[38:20.020 --> 38:20.800]  Oh, Christ.
[38:20.940 --> 38:21.340]  Yeah!
[38:23.340 --> 38:24.560]  Oh, man.
[38:25.460 --> 38:26.020]  Don't do it, man.
[38:29.560 --> 38:33.840]  I remember when I said I think that mission
[38:33.840 --> 38:35.360]  may have been part of the Diamond Knights.
[38:35.360 --> 38:36.540]  Yeah, it was.
[38:39.120 --> 38:40.580]  So, was that the first mission?
[38:40.940 --> 38:41.600]  Yeah, I think so.
[38:43.100 --> 38:43.620]  I'm sorry.
[38:43.700 --> 38:45.600]  What did you say, Eric? Atlantic Salmon.
[38:47.080 --> 38:47.900]  But isn't this
[38:47.900 --> 38:48.640]  also an old mission?
[38:49.540 --> 38:49.900]  No.
[38:50.680 --> 38:53.580]  You never did any of the casino stuff, you fool.
[38:53.920 --> 38:54.720]  How would you know?
[38:54.760 --> 38:56.680]  I swear I was in a club with that old woman.
[39:01.740 --> 39:03.740]  I just think you should get a haircut like this guy, Geoff.
[39:04.400 --> 39:05.380]  You think so?
[39:05.840 --> 39:07.000]  Yeah, I can pull it off.
[39:07.280 --> 39:08.940]  I think Gavin should get a haircut like the old woman.
[39:09.340 --> 39:09.880]  Like that.
[39:10.720 --> 39:12.960]  Just do kind of like a low taper,
[39:13.260 --> 39:14.380]  medium taper fade.
[39:14.400 --> 39:15.360]  Frost the tips.
[39:17.540 --> 39:19.840]  Kind of just shave down the one side.
[39:19.980 --> 39:22.320]  Real severe line where the hair ends.
[39:22.340 --> 39:24.040]  You know, I used to have
[39:24.040 --> 39:26.300]  frosted tips back in the late 90s.
[39:26.620 --> 39:27.360]  Oh, me too, baby.
[39:28.520 --> 39:29.740]  Not a good look.
[39:30.800 --> 39:31.180]  No.
[39:31.820 --> 39:33.040]  We could do it again though.
[39:33.220 --> 39:34.160]  We could bring it back.
[39:37.600 --> 39:39.500]  So you guys have to bang that dude?
[39:40.600 --> 39:41.440]  I believe so, yeah.
[39:41.560 --> 39:43.100]  I think that's how Gavin should dress.
[39:43.640 --> 39:44.000]  Like this?
[39:44.200 --> 39:46.720]  Gavin should do deep V, cool hat.
[39:47.160 --> 39:47.820]  Big neckless.
[39:50.020 --> 39:50.800]  I'll give it a go.
[39:51.800 --> 39:52.040]  Yeah?
[39:52.920 --> 39:55.160]  You think Meg would like it if you start wearing a big hat?
[39:55.840 --> 39:56.080]  Hmm.
[39:57.140 --> 39:57.380]  I don't know.
[40:01.200 --> 40:02.260]  Oh, it's his mom?
[40:04.340 --> 40:05.180]  That was
[40:05.180 --> 40:07.420]  the woman that Trevor
[40:07.420 --> 40:08.700]  likes in the campaign, right?
[40:10.700 --> 40:11.080]  Is it?
[40:11.380 --> 40:12.540]  I have no memory.
[40:12.760 --> 40:13.720]  Oh, maybe.
[40:16.780 --> 40:21.400]  Oh, this is
[40:21.400 --> 40:22.480]  Martin Madrazo's kid?
[40:31.200 --> 40:32.940]  He grows a bunch of coke?
[40:32.980 --> 40:35.460]  I don't think I've ever heard it put...
[40:35.460 --> 40:37.160]  said like that.
[40:37.580 --> 40:40.040]  Oh, yeah, I'm just growing my coke plants.
[40:41.180 --> 40:43.340]  Gotta get the popcorn seeds and then you grow the coke.
[40:47.920 --> 40:49.360]  Popcorn seeds was crazy.
[40:49.880 --> 40:52.020]  Oh, I'd blocked that from my memory until just this moment.
[40:55.320 --> 40:56.320]  This guy's familiar.
[40:56.460 --> 40:58.420]  What do you think the chances are you guys are going to finish this?
[40:59.380 --> 41:00.280]  I mean, zero.
[41:00.900 --> 41:02.140]  But, you know, it is what it is.
[41:02.140 --> 41:04.000]  Nick can message the CPF.
[41:04.320 --> 41:06.060]  He can just say, hey, I'm going to be about 10 minutes late.
[41:08.980 --> 41:10.380]  What are they going to do? Mess up your taxes?
[41:10.520 --> 41:11.340]  That guy sounds like you, Gavin.
[41:12.960 --> 41:14.260]  Yeah, Gavin, you're just like that guy.
[41:22.700 --> 41:24.060]  Is that guy from the north?
[41:24.500 --> 41:24.820]  No.
[41:25.860 --> 41:27.740]  Do you feel like you're back home now?
[41:28.700 --> 41:29.840]  More home than I was before.
[41:29.840 --> 41:35.060]  Do you get a warm tingle every time you hear a posh accent?
[41:39.220 --> 41:41.220]  I went to a party
[41:42.780 --> 41:44.980]  and met a girl that was from like
[41:45.460 --> 41:46.340]  northern England.
[41:46.720 --> 41:48.240]  And I said, I don't know what the real difference is
[41:48.240 --> 41:50.260]  other than you're just so much more polite
[41:50.260 --> 41:51.040]  than Londoners.
[41:51.120 --> 41:52.880]  And she went, oh, thank you so much.
[41:54.740 --> 41:56.320]  That's all you really have to say.
[41:56.540 --> 41:57.400]  And they love it.
[41:57.880 --> 41:58.860]  Londoners and polite?
[42:00.300 --> 42:01.340]  They're busy people.
[42:11.870 --> 42:15.610]  If you told me that that was Gavin doing that voice
[42:15.610 --> 42:17.370]  and that he had just been keeping it from us
[42:17.370 --> 42:18.890]  that he was in this game, I'd believe you.
[42:20.490 --> 42:23.890]  Like you're in Red Dead 2, Gavin's just in these weird heist missions
[42:23.890 --> 42:24.650]  all of a sudden.
[42:25.830 --> 42:27.690]  Gavin plays British twat.
[42:29.650 --> 42:30.450]  I feel like
[42:30.450 --> 42:32.010]  you should have just not told any of us
[42:32.010 --> 42:32.790]  that you were in Red Dead.
[42:33.730 --> 42:36.110]  Well, I could have pulled it off
[42:36.110 --> 42:37.330]  but I don't know that Jack was capable.
[42:37.830 --> 42:40.010]  Yes, I agree with
[42:40.010 --> 42:40.850]  that, baby.
[42:41.670 --> 42:43.750]  I think Jack had a lob on for nine months straight
[42:43.750 --> 42:44.510]  before it came out.
[42:49.510 --> 42:50.730]  This cutscene's still happening.
[42:51.530 --> 42:53.030]  This is what I'm talking about!
[42:53.030 --> 42:54.970]  Very well looked after, my friend.
[42:55.350 --> 42:56.950]  Do you think this is the casino heist?
[42:57.130 --> 42:58.630]  Just a fucking space monkey!
[42:58.870 --> 42:59.910]  I've never seen this.
[43:00.590 --> 43:02.690]  The funny part about it is you guys are gonna stop
[43:02.690 --> 43:05.310]  and then you'll have to do it again and it'll make you watch this cutscene again.
[43:06.650 --> 43:07.810]  We're not gonna have to stop, we got it.
[43:07.930 --> 43:08.790]  No complications.
[43:10.290 --> 43:11.050]  Let's get out of here.
[43:11.050 --> 43:12.490]  Where's the outdoor? Oh, shit!
[43:12.730 --> 43:13.010]  That way!
[43:15.850 --> 43:16.690]  Where's the outdoor?
[43:20.490 --> 43:21.070]  Alright, I'm coming.
[43:23.810 --> 43:25.350]  I had to dance a little.
[43:25.950 --> 43:26.590]  Yeah, we know.
[43:26.750 --> 43:27.710]  So what was that all about?
[43:27.830 --> 43:29.470]  I don't know, I didn't listen.
[43:29.790 --> 43:31.090]  They're growing coke plants.
[43:32.450 --> 43:33.670]  Oh, you're driving that?
[43:34.210 --> 43:34.970]  Where are we going?
[43:36.770 --> 43:37.590]  Andrew, no!
[43:38.550 --> 43:39.710]  Here you go.
[43:41.150 --> 43:41.630]  I'm waiting.
[43:43.250 --> 43:43.770]  Okay, let's go.
[43:44.130 --> 43:45.110]  Nick's bullying me.
[43:46.370 --> 43:47.430]  You're in a truck!
[43:47.650 --> 43:48.750]  This is a classic complication.
[43:52.170 --> 43:52.870]  Oh, damn.
[43:52.950 --> 43:54.090]  This whole vehicle is death proof.
[43:55.790 --> 43:57.270]  Are we going to the check mark?
[43:58.410 --> 43:58.590]  Yep.
[43:58.730 --> 44:01.270]  That woman got really gummed up in my tires for a second there.
[44:01.370 --> 44:02.050]  Oh, no!
[44:03.510 --> 44:03.950]  Oh!
[44:07.540 --> 44:08.180]  Who's driving?
[44:08.420 --> 44:08.880]  Are we still getting bullied?
[44:09.140 --> 44:10.640]  Nick parked behind a railing.
[44:12.340 --> 44:13.180]  And a tree.
[44:13.400 --> 44:13.800]  It's okay.
[44:15.600 --> 44:16.480]  Palm's tracks.
[44:17.300 --> 44:19.180]  This isn't the heist, Joel, is it?
[44:19.760 --> 44:20.700]  I don't think so.
[44:21.060 --> 44:21.960]  This can't be the right thing.
[44:22.380 --> 44:23.660]  This is not the right thing.
[44:26.100 --> 44:26.900]  Andrew, damn!
[44:28.180 --> 44:28.740]  I don't know.
[44:28.880 --> 44:30.520]  I just got randomly texted this.
[44:30.580 --> 44:31.160]  I was like, whatever.
[44:36.420 --> 44:39.280]  So we never should have even been anywhere near the casino?
[44:39.780 --> 44:40.180]  No!
[44:40.320 --> 44:42.400]  We were supposed to do the cut scene.
[44:42.860 --> 44:45.420]  That was a new mission, I think, in between.
[44:46.900 --> 44:48.760]  We're in the middle of a mission right now.
[44:48.760 --> 44:52.180]  That I just accepted via text, but I don't think it's what we need to do.
[44:52.180 --> 44:54.080]  Stop accepting missions in the middle of our missions!
[44:54.460 --> 44:55.580]  What the fuck are you doing?
[44:55.580 --> 44:56.640]  I don't have audio!
[44:56.820 --> 44:58.540]  What are we supposed to be doing?
[44:58.740 --> 44:59.820]  And you guys are like, I don't know.
[45:00.840 --> 45:02.180]  You can't go in here.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.880]  Okay, well, then we gotta go to the music store.
[45:05.300 --> 45:06.860]  Why the fuck are you over there?
[45:11.720 --> 45:12.520]  Oh, Christ.
[45:13.560 --> 45:14.740]  I got a music store to go to.
[45:14.980 --> 45:16.280]  Why did you leave me?
[45:16.280 --> 45:18.600]  Because I got a music store to go to.
[45:18.780 --> 45:19.560]  Eric, get in the minivan.
[45:20.520 --> 45:21.280]  Okay, I'm coming.
[45:21.340 --> 45:22.340]  I'm at the music store.
[45:23.660 --> 45:25.920]  Oh, I'm supposed to kill these guys!
[45:26.320 --> 45:27.080]  Alright, do it.
[45:27.980 --> 45:30.300]  A thief is fleeing with the DJ equipment.
[45:30.600 --> 45:32.020]  We'll be there eventually.
[45:32.500 --> 45:34.560]  Me and Gavin are in a Honda Odyssey.
[45:40.220 --> 45:41.520]  Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.140]  I don't think we're supposed to be doing this mission.
[45:44.140 --> 45:46.900]  Well, we were getting a lot of military equipment and military vehicles,
[45:47.060 --> 45:48.880]  and then somebody said, steal the CD.
[46:00.670 --> 46:01.350]  Andrew!
[46:02.730 --> 46:04.350]  Get in here!
[46:08.770 --> 46:10.170]  I'm gonna pass out.
[46:11.050 --> 46:12.530]  What are we doing?
[46:16.750 --> 46:19.870]  We're delivering the equipment to the music box.
[46:22.010 --> 46:23.670]  It's a government CD.
[46:24.130 --> 46:25.050]  Government issued.
[46:33.050 --> 46:35.610]  This is definitely the right mission.
[46:35.990 --> 46:40.030]  Wait, this video is just whatever Andrew feels like in his phone.
[46:40.410 --> 46:40.790]  No!
[46:41.310 --> 46:41.810]  I am!
[46:42.250 --> 46:45.030]  Andrew answers his texts, the video.
[46:45.930 --> 46:46.810]  This is...
[46:47.370 --> 46:48.950]  Oh my god!
[46:49.110 --> 46:49.830]  Oh, my stomach!
[46:51.090 --> 46:51.590]  What is it?
[46:52.630 --> 46:55.830]  I'm just farting around in a red-oh-a-spice.
[46:55.870 --> 46:56.330]  Oh no!
[46:56.770 --> 46:58.790]  Oh no!
[47:05.590 --> 47:07.430]  Why are we doing this?
[47:07.710 --> 47:09.130]  I got a text message,
[47:09.350 --> 47:11.170]  and I couldn't hear the audio,
[47:11.410 --> 47:13.350]  so I thought, oh, maybe this is part of the thing.
[47:13.350 --> 47:15.370]  Did you read the text message?
[47:16.210 --> 47:17.250]  Oh, fuck, I'm gonna throw up.
[47:17.530 --> 47:18.310]  Oh my god.
[47:18.870 --> 47:21.690]  I wonder how many minutes ago we stopped doing the mini-heist.
[47:21.990 --> 47:26.070]  We only did one of the missions,
[47:26.210 --> 47:27.910]  and Andrew's like, this is time-critical.
[47:28.690 --> 47:29.810]  We have to do this.
[47:29.830 --> 47:31.330]  I've been focused in on the missions!
[47:31.510 --> 47:33.990]  Then a quick pivot to an old casino heist.
[47:37.130 --> 47:39.430]  We came into this after a meeting.
[47:39.610 --> 47:41.070]  I didn't think we were gonna do it,
[47:41.070 --> 47:42.530]  because Nick has a hard-out.
[47:42.690 --> 47:44.230]  We still haven't done it.
[47:44.750 --> 47:46.010]  Well, we won't today.
[47:47.350 --> 47:48.330]  Go, go, go, go.
[47:49.350 --> 47:51.590]  It's fine, you can delay your meeting by 10 minutes.
[47:52.510 --> 47:53.670]  I'm gonna throw up.
[47:53.910 --> 47:54.730]  Oh my god.
[47:55.330 --> 47:56.210]  This is weird.
[47:56.730 --> 47:58.370]  We did it, boys.
[47:58.870 --> 47:59.910]  We got it.
[48:00.410 --> 48:02.490]  That absolutely wasn't the right mission.
[48:04.230 --> 48:04.590]  That's not what we were supposed to do.
[48:04.590 --> 48:06.050]  We're going back to the Garmin factory.
[48:06.830 --> 48:08.690]  Why were we ever in the casino?
[48:08.690 --> 48:10.630]  We don't have time for this.
[48:10.630 --> 48:11.390]  We're at the last part!
[48:12.590 --> 48:13.770]  How long is this?
[48:14.150 --> 48:15.050]  Nick, get in!
[48:18.010 --> 48:19.410]  I'm gonna email them.
[48:21.130 --> 48:22.350]  What are we doing?
[48:22.650 --> 48:23.230]  Here, you drive.
[48:23.690 --> 48:24.910]  We gotta get to the Garmin factory.
[48:26.770 --> 48:28.510]  Why is Martin calling me? I'm not gonna answer.
[48:28.650 --> 48:31.590]  I'm not answering anybody, we're going straight to the...
[48:31.590 --> 48:33.090]  I'm turning my phone off,
[48:33.150 --> 48:34.710]  we're going back to the Garmin factory.
[48:35.350 --> 48:37.710]  Let's play GTA, Andrew double-books himself.
[48:38.230 --> 48:40.770]  Dude, what the hell is this?
[48:41.090 --> 48:42.010]  I don't have audio.
[48:42.290 --> 48:43.210]  Why don't you have audio?
[48:43.910 --> 48:45.830]  It doesn't work, I don't know why.
[48:45.910 --> 48:48.110]  It's in the recording, but it's not... I can't hear it.
[48:48.130 --> 48:50.010]  So wait, since we started playing games,
[48:50.070 --> 48:51.010]  you've never had game audio?
[48:51.910 --> 48:53.170]  No, just today.
[48:53.570 --> 48:55.730]  I rebooted everything, and it's...
[48:55.730 --> 48:58.110]  I unplugged stuff, I reset stuff.
[48:58.230 --> 49:00.030]  I unplugged stuff.
[49:00.350 --> 49:01.570]  Alright, well, this is...
[49:01.570 --> 49:04.550]  Sorry you couldn't hear this video, anyone at home.
[49:04.830 --> 49:05.690]  No, it works.
[49:05.690 --> 49:08.990]  I can see it making noise in the record thing.
[49:09.070 --> 49:10.070]  Why don't you just look at the waveform
[49:10.070 --> 49:11.570]  and imagine what the sound was.
[49:16.480 --> 49:19.160]  Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, are you having fun with heists?
[49:19.220 --> 49:21.380]  Dude, I'm having so much fun with heists,
[49:21.520 --> 49:22.260]  you have no idea.
[49:23.140 --> 49:24.620]  And we're almost back at the Garmin factory.
[49:25.080 --> 49:26.720]  I'm having so much fun
[49:26.720 --> 49:27.580]  not playing.
[49:30.060 --> 49:31.620]  That gave me heartburn.
[49:32.940 --> 49:34.500]  This really is
[49:34.500 --> 49:36.100]  kind of how it goes.
[49:38.220 --> 49:39.260]  Gavin is right.
[49:39.700 --> 49:40.940]  Andrew is in charge.
[49:41.240 --> 49:42.760]  Well, the best thing is that at the beginning
[49:42.760 --> 49:43.240]  you were like,
[49:44.340 --> 49:46.080]  it's really, truly something.
[49:46.640 --> 49:48.020]  We were like, is this okay?
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.380]  And I was like, yeah, he's got it this time.
[49:52.360 --> 49:53.080]  Here we go.
[49:53.840 --> 49:54.780]  Sitting down.
[49:55.220 --> 49:56.400]  I told him I'll be late.
[49:58.280 --> 49:59.340]  Hang on, hang on.
[50:01.080 --> 50:02.600]  Logging in to Darnell Inc.
[50:02.880 --> 50:03.360]  Hang on.
[50:05.400 --> 50:05.840]  Uh...
[50:05.840 --> 50:07.300]  Visit Jody's contact
[50:07.300 --> 50:09.960]  inside the music locker at the Diamond Casino
[50:09.960 --> 50:11.120]  and Resort to inquire.
[50:11.500 --> 50:12.300]  We didn't do it, I guess.
[50:12.360 --> 50:15.540]  We went there, we did the wrong mission.
[50:15.700 --> 50:17.280]  Then we went back and did a different mission
[50:17.280 --> 50:18.480]  and neither of them were the mission.
[50:19.140 --> 50:21.120]  I don't know. On the bright side,
[50:21.300 --> 50:24.160]  you won't have those missions to distract you when you walk back in now.
[50:24.240 --> 50:24.780]  That's true.
[50:25.460 --> 50:27.620]  What the hell?
[50:29.000 --> 50:29.660]  Hop in, guys.
[50:29.660 --> 50:31.080]  I'm in charge of this van.
[50:31.760 --> 50:33.060]  Oh, Andrew, wait.
[50:34.260 --> 50:35.240]  Let's do it, Gavin.
[50:35.660 --> 50:37.120]  Let's go. To the casino?
[50:37.700 --> 50:39.360]  Back to the music locker.
[50:45.710 --> 50:47.690]  Listen, they're gonna really like us in there
[50:47.690 --> 50:49.550]  because we've got the CDs.
[50:50.090 --> 50:51.350]  They really like the music now.
[50:51.510 --> 50:53.350]  Guys, thanks for watching this one.
[50:53.670 --> 50:55.510]  There's no way
[50:55.510 --> 50:57.930]  we do the wrong mission a third time.
[50:58.170 --> 51:00.110]  Right? Stay tuned to find out.
[51:01.950 --> 51:03.450]  Miguel Madrazo mission.
[51:03.450 --> 51:04.490]  Don't get distracted.
[51:08.650 --> 51:16.110]  I will say, you know, they've done a very good job
[51:16.110 --> 51:18.310]  with all this so far. The UI could be a little bit better.
[51:19.670 --> 51:21.750]  I mean, it's been over a decade
[51:21.750 --> 51:24.150]  so they probably could have tightened up a little bit.
[51:24.430 --> 51:26.070]  It's code on top of code on top of code
[51:26.070 --> 51:26.750]  on top of code.
[51:27.950 --> 51:30.290]  If we go back and change any of it, none of it works.
[51:31.990 --> 51:32.550]  Okay.
[51:33.190 --> 51:35.350]  Isn't that why the first Red Dead Redemption
[51:35.350 --> 51:36.970]  didn't come out on anything else
[51:36.970 --> 51:37.950]  for a really long time?
[51:38.210 --> 51:41.430]  It's held together
[51:41.430 --> 51:42.230]  with scotch tape.
[51:43.650 --> 51:44.490]  I'm in.
[51:45.670 --> 51:46.950]  Do you suck us in?
[51:48.250 --> 51:49.190]  He's doing what?
[51:50.270 --> 51:51.630]  Use the image provided by Jody.
[51:52.770 --> 51:53.510]  Jody's good.
[51:53.950 --> 51:54.730]  She's the woman.
[51:55.910 --> 51:57.790]  They were looking for a white dude
[51:57.790 --> 51:58.770]  in a baseball hat.
[51:58.770 --> 51:59.610]  In here?
[52:00.730 --> 52:01.810]  You see him, Gavin?
[52:02.670 --> 52:03.790]  I see him out here.
[52:05.210 --> 52:07.270]  We're keeping our eyes peeled out here at the entrance.
[52:07.750 --> 52:09.230]  You might have the image on your phone
[52:09.230 --> 52:09.670]  as well.
[52:11.390 --> 52:12.370]  Is it in the text?
[52:13.370 --> 52:15.210]  Are we trying to see if these
[52:15.210 --> 52:16.610]  ladies will come join us in this minivan?
[52:18.350 --> 52:19.150]  A rat
[52:19.150 --> 52:21.230]  and a Tron freak just hanging out?
[52:21.310 --> 52:22.390]  How could they ignore us?
[52:23.550 --> 52:24.290]  I think I found him.
[52:24.590 --> 52:25.130]  Got it.
[52:26.610 --> 52:27.670]  I got the card.
[52:28.270 --> 52:29.550]  That's not a white hat at all.
[52:29.950 --> 52:31.450]  Do you want to come in the van?
[52:31.870 --> 52:33.010]  Excuse me.
[52:34.230 --> 52:35.810]  This guy's looking at us.
[52:36.010 --> 52:36.470]  The ladies aren't.
[52:38.990 --> 52:39.870]  Hell yeah.
[52:41.130 --> 52:41.970]  Andrew's got the bag.
[52:42.110 --> 52:42.490]  Let's go.
[52:44.090 --> 52:44.970]  Fuck you.
[52:45.330 --> 52:46.210]  Oh my god.
[52:50.610 --> 52:51.430]  Jody called.
[52:51.570 --> 52:53.710]  I answered and then you hit me with my own car
[52:53.710 --> 52:56.050]  and I don't know...
[52:56.050 --> 52:56.310]  Geoff.
[52:56.610 --> 52:58.090]  I'll mark it.
[52:59.290 --> 53:01.130]  It's already marked.
[53:01.570 --> 53:03.670]  I mean it's marked but it's not marked.
[53:03.670 --> 53:04.210]  I got you, Gavin.
[53:04.910 --> 53:07.670]  I got you, dude.
[53:08.450 --> 53:10.070]  So far, if someone told me to describe
[53:10.070 --> 53:11.390]  this mini-heist, it would be
[53:12.010 --> 53:14.210]  go between the casino and the garment factory
[53:14.210 --> 53:14.490]  a bunch.
[53:16.410 --> 53:17.950]  I turned this mini-heist
[53:17.950 --> 53:18.830]  into a medium heist.
[53:19.390 --> 53:21.470]  Sometimes you get to do a mini-heist.
[53:21.470 --> 53:24.370]  Sometimes you do other missions for other heists.
[53:24.590 --> 53:26.050]  Or steal DJ equipment.
[53:27.170 --> 53:28.890]  We did that really well.
[53:29.190 --> 53:29.830]  That was awesome.
[53:31.230 --> 53:32.350]  You pointed us in the direction
[53:32.350 --> 53:33.470]  they were bumping.
[53:34.210 --> 53:36.350]  So we literally just drove
[53:36.350 --> 53:37.430]  from point A to point B?
[53:37.910 --> 53:38.190]  Uh huh.
[53:38.950 --> 53:42.370]  Isn't driving from point A to point B what happens most of the time you drive though?
[53:42.810 --> 53:43.310]  Yeah, kinda.
[53:45.310 --> 53:46.150]  Override key delivered?
[53:46.590 --> 53:47.870]  Well, we're complete.
[53:48.830 --> 53:49.910]  Okay, now we got the final one.
[53:49.910 --> 53:52.490]  The final one!
[53:52.850 --> 53:54.230]  Those were the setups.
[53:54.650 --> 53:55.170]  Who's that guy?
[53:57.750 --> 53:58.870]  Who's these guys?
[53:59.510 --> 54:00.070]  Now we make our money.
[54:01.310 --> 54:02.730]  Oh, Nick, nice.
[54:03.530 --> 54:03.970]  Thanks, man.
[54:05.010 --> 54:05.470]  Sit down.
[54:06.830 --> 54:08.610]  I think you sat him down.
[54:09.650 --> 54:10.050]  Here we go.
[54:11.070 --> 54:11.610]  Where are you?
[54:12.070 --> 54:13.330]  He's playing computer.
[54:14.190 --> 54:15.150]  Equipment added.
[54:17.830 --> 54:18.470]  Target.
[54:18.470 --> 54:19.370]  Get the scarab.
[54:21.470 --> 54:22.690]  Oh, what the fuck?
[54:23.250 --> 54:24.290]  Oh, shit.
[54:24.690 --> 54:25.470]  Jody, fuck off.
[54:25.990 --> 54:27.990]  Jody interrupting my sprint again.
[54:28.850 --> 54:29.030]  Yeah.
[54:30.470 --> 54:32.850]  She's calling from a vacation far away.
[54:34.970 --> 54:35.910]  Still getting in the Crusader.
[54:37.610 --> 54:38.430]  Do we all need to be in that?
[54:39.430 --> 54:39.730]  Yep.
[54:40.550 --> 54:41.290]  Where's the Crusader?
[54:41.770 --> 54:42.610]  Andrew's got it.
[54:42.770 --> 54:44.170]  Back up just a little bit.
[54:46.350 --> 54:47.010]  There you go.
[54:47.070 --> 54:48.070]  Back a little more.
[54:48.590 --> 54:48.850]  Oh!
[54:50.090 --> 54:50.730]  Here I come.
[54:50.870 --> 54:53.390]  Oh, nice roll. Tactical roll.
[54:54.830 --> 54:55.410]  Everybody in?
[54:55.690 --> 54:57.110]  I painted the Crusader a little bit.
[54:58.210 --> 55:00.530]  Hop in, hop down, jump down, hop in.
[55:00.630 --> 55:01.810]  Hop in, jump down, hop in.
[55:02.610 --> 55:04.370]  You have to jump down and hop in.
[55:04.390 --> 55:04.970]  He's got land on it.
[55:05.030 --> 55:05.250]  I'm jumping.
[55:07.290 --> 55:07.910]  Nailed it.
[55:08.510 --> 55:09.170]  Here we go, buddy.
[55:11.750 --> 55:12.730]  Here we go.
[55:12.990 --> 55:13.470]  Alright, boys, let's do it.
[55:13.570 --> 55:15.330]  Ford Zancudo, holy shit, that's a drive.
[55:15.850 --> 55:17.150]  Let's go to Ford Zancudo.
[55:17.270 --> 55:18.470]  Let's get the DJ equipment.
[55:18.790 --> 55:21.210]  We'll get the CDs to resell.
[55:21.550 --> 55:23.310]  Can't wait to bring them back to the...
[55:23.310 --> 55:24.730]  Fuckin' chopped and screwed.
[55:29.090 --> 55:30.270]  Screwed is right.
[55:31.810 --> 55:33.790]  I can't shoot any weapons in this.
[55:34.430 --> 55:34.830]  That's good.
[55:35.690 --> 55:37.250]  Sell them in the ACV parking lot.
[55:37.910 --> 55:38.650]  Quite a drive.
[55:40.690 --> 55:42.230]  Oh, Y lets me open the weapons.
[55:45.890 --> 55:47.470]  I was gonna do the same thing,
[55:47.550 --> 55:49.110]  but I thought it was gonna be too,
[55:49.730 --> 55:50.770]  like, obvious.
[55:51.330 --> 55:53.010]  I'm going with quantity over quality.
[55:53.650 --> 55:55.070]  I like it, that's great.
[55:55.570 --> 55:57.150]  I mean, hey man, that's what got us here.
[55:57.170 --> 55:59.870]  I just need a slight lapse in judgment from one person.
[55:59.970 --> 56:01.430]  This whole video has been
[56:01.430 --> 56:03.130]  quantity over quality.
[56:04.530 --> 56:06.810]  How many missions can we fit in?
[56:06.810 --> 56:08.190]  Are they all connected?
[56:08.430 --> 56:10.190]  Nah, it's just kinda like whatever Andrew's feeling.
[56:11.290 --> 56:13.110]  Well, not having audio really
[56:13.110 --> 56:15.030]  makes it difficult sometimes to tell
[56:15.030 --> 56:17.490]  what is being instructed and what is not.
[56:18.150 --> 56:19.470]  I guess I missed
[56:19.470 --> 56:21.590]  a whole DLC or something with that music room.
[56:24.210 --> 56:25.690]  I had never seen that.
[56:25.790 --> 56:27.030]  Gavin, you may have seen that before.
[56:27.030 --> 56:28.870]  Yeah, I think that's the one where you take a plane
[56:28.870 --> 56:31.250]  to a beach island and there's like a DJ there.
[56:32.030 --> 56:32.270]  Yep.
[56:33.050 --> 56:34.110]  Cool. Sounds good.
[56:34.110 --> 56:35.530]  We'll do it one day.
[56:37.150 --> 56:38.090]  When did that come out?
[56:39.110 --> 56:40.670]  2017? 2016?
[56:41.210 --> 56:41.630]  Yeah, probably.
[56:41.930 --> 56:42.810]  Maybe 2019?
[56:43.930 --> 56:44.310]  Okay.
[56:45.250 --> 56:45.710]  Press Y.
[56:47.690 --> 56:50.010]  Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[57:01.230 --> 57:03.130]  This is the longest part of the heist.
[57:03.930 --> 57:04.970]  Driving to the base.
[57:05.650 --> 57:06.970]  Yeah, but at least it's to
[57:06.970 --> 57:08.490]  the mission that we need to do.
[57:10.170 --> 57:11.590]  Get the fuck out.
[57:11.590 --> 57:12.810]  I think the longest part of the heist
[57:12.810 --> 57:14.630]  is when we did two other things.
[57:14.790 --> 57:17.010]  When we were just driving between the two buildings.
[57:17.010 --> 57:18.890]  Those were building multipliers.
[57:19.730 --> 57:21.070]  And think about when we go to do
[57:21.070 --> 57:22.910]  the diamond heist, we already gotta step up.
[57:22.910 --> 57:24.350]  Yeah, we've already got chainsawed.
[57:32.120 --> 57:32.780]  I wasn't sure
[57:32.780 --> 57:34.540]  what heist we would do next, but now I know.
[57:35.580 --> 57:36.600]  You don't even know what heist
[57:36.600 --> 57:37.440]  we're doing now.
[57:39.100 --> 57:40.900]  Surely we're on doomsday now, aren't we?
[57:42.220 --> 57:42.900]  I would think,
[57:42.900 --> 57:44.980]  but we already just started one part of diamonds.
[57:46.640 --> 57:49.060]  Okay, well then we'll just leave diamonds for a while.
[57:49.580 --> 57:50.560]  Come back to it.
[57:53.600 --> 57:54.560]  Okay, we're almost there.
[57:56.940 --> 57:59.320]  Looking back, my favorite part is when we were in the club
[57:59.320 --> 58:00.480]  and I was like, haven't we
[58:01.060 --> 58:02.080]  done this before?
[58:02.760 --> 58:03.200]  No.
[58:07.620 --> 58:09.220]  Yeah, Gavin, you're insane.
[58:09.740 --> 58:11.420]  Well, I was right. I had never seen
[58:11.420 --> 58:13.500]  that before. That's fair. That's right. Andrew
[58:13.500 --> 58:15.440]  was right. I was right
[58:15.440 --> 58:16.000]  about that.
[58:17.840 --> 58:19.220]  Oh, nice evasive
[58:19.220 --> 58:19.540]  throw.
[58:21.280 --> 58:21.880]  We're fine.
[58:23.600 --> 58:24.360]  Sorting it out.
[58:26.120 --> 58:26.840]  Sorting it out.
[58:27.580 --> 58:28.080]  We're here.
[58:29.720 --> 58:30.900]  Well, we're kind of here.
[58:31.340 --> 58:33.440]  We're close. I mean, I can see it.
[58:33.480 --> 58:35.040]  I can see the fort. You can see it.
[58:35.360 --> 58:37.520]  Geoff, how are those fish biting, man? I don't know what you're talking
[58:37.520 --> 58:39.080]  about. I'm just watching you guys drive.
[58:41.580 --> 58:41.980]  I
[58:43.600 --> 58:45.340]  certainly didn't just hit level 17.
[58:46.300 --> 58:46.980]  Yeah, baby!
[58:48.260 --> 58:48.860]  Way to go, man.
[58:50.020 --> 58:50.960]  Alright, boys, we're in.
[58:52.140 --> 58:52.560]  Oh, stop.
[58:53.820 --> 58:54.220]  Wow.
[58:57.920 --> 58:59.220]  I don't think I've ever been allowed in here.
[59:00.360 --> 59:01.280]  This is crazy.
[59:01.660 --> 59:02.380]  This is bad.
[59:03.600 --> 59:05.060]  I've never seen it
[59:05.500 --> 59:06.460]  from this angle.
[59:07.480 --> 59:08.380]  You know what I mean?
[59:10.120 --> 59:10.960]  Here we go.
[59:14.780 --> 59:15.300]  What?
[59:18.740 --> 59:19.900]  Just a collection
[59:19.900 --> 59:21.440]  of weirdos is what we are.
[59:24.080 --> 59:25.000]  Oh, man.
[59:25.700 --> 59:26.220]  Alright.
[59:27.600 --> 59:29.360]  Let me show the pass to the guards.
[59:29.380 --> 59:30.160]  Stay calm and look confident.
[59:30.880 --> 59:33.880]  Yeah, we're running full speed to the guards.
[59:35.960 --> 59:37.260]  Hey, what's up, man?
[59:37.300 --> 59:39.220]  Everything seems to be in order.
[59:39.720 --> 59:40.660]  Got this pass right here.
[59:40.660 --> 59:42.700]  There's a lot of hips in our walk.
[59:43.320 --> 59:43.720]  Yeah.
[59:44.400 --> 59:45.540]  Oh, you gotta show off.
[59:47.640 --> 59:47.860]  Hey, man.
[59:48.160 --> 59:48.960]  You got real close to it.
[59:49.520 --> 59:51.500]  I wanna make sure you can see it real good.
[59:51.680 --> 59:52.360]  There's a lot of confidence, man.
[59:54.060 --> 59:55.260]  There's a lift in here?
[59:55.520 --> 59:56.400]  Holy shit.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.880]  I should've told them 20 minutes.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.800]  Who would've thought we'd be starting the main heist
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.600]  five minutes after you had to leave?
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.340]  Well, we started the main heist
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.580]  on time.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.300]  And then what happened?
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.680]  Then we did two side heists.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.400]  Side heists?
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.460]  This is between the heists during the heists.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.660]  Someone just walked through the wall.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.140]  Between the during.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.600]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.920]  Locate the loading bay.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.900]  Why are we all walking like gremlins?
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:32.780]  Because we're sneaking.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:35.640]  Stay out of the cones of vision.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:36.860]  Okay.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.320]  Eric, what time is our meeting?
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.100]  Do we kill them?
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.320]  No, we're good.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.040]  Do we kill them?
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.760]  No, I don't think so.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.000]  I'm sneaking by.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.060]  Yeah, Nick did it.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.920]  Nick did what Nick wants to do.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.600]  Nick did what was necessary.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.060]  Is this real?
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.780]  Is the world empty?
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.620]  What's going on here?
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.760]  What do you mean?
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.260]  There's guys you have to avoid.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.780]  Gavin walked off the ledge of the world.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.100]  There's a world hole.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:15.680]  What?
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.900]  Don't worry about it, Gavin.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.120]  Are you just gone?
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.180]  I got reset back to the beginning.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.500]  They shouldn't leave an open world hole, though.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.460]  It's irresponsible.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.180]  At least put a sign up.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:31.040]  Or like a piece of tape up or something.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.660]  A mouse made that.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.140]  I think I'm nearing the loading bay.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.120]  That's a dead end.
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.660]  All the way back we go.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.960]  I found a room with some stuff.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.140]  Can I take any of this?
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.580]  Oh, hey, what happened, boys?
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.900]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.700]  Who did something?
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.280]  It wasn't me.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.500]  I know what your instinct is to think.
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.060]  It wasn't Nick.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.880]  I know what your instinct is to think.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.400]  I think I found the loading bay and it started the fight.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.940]  I think you might be right.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.840]  Can I dive out the world hole and get back to the beginning?
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:14.520]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.880]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.140]  I'm hacking the controls.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.480]  Oh, holy shit!
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.120]  Heavily armored dude!
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.580]  Is it Juggernauts?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.480]  Juggernaut!
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.620]  Yeah, I turned the corner
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.620]  and I'm like, oh, I'll gun this guy down.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.800]  No fucking shot.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.280]  Wow!
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.220]  Nick, what are you doing on the Game Boy?
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.560]  I don't know.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.800]  I don't know what the password is.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.180]  Try 1, 2, 3, 5.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.800]  Arrange the letters to guess the password.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:45.980]  You guys are fucked.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.840]  I don't know where the fight is.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880]  I just hear a lot of swearing.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.360]  I'm opening a door.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.060]  Oh, nice, Nick.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.600]  I did something?
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.840]  You opened the door and disabled the alarm.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.520]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:01.900]  Got him.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.220]  Oh, nice, Eric.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.120]  That was a 1-2.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.660]  That was just in case business.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.440]  That was just in case.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.340]  Arrange the letters to guess the password.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.960]  Open the next door, Nick.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.660]  N-A-J.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.400]  How are you guys already through all these doors?
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.040]  I don't know. They were open. We just walked.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.820]  It's the same password again?
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:22.780]  Careful, careful.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.060]  That is lazy.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.560]  What are we doing?
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.840]  Holy shit, what the fuck is this?
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.980]  Oh, I'm getting blasted.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.040]  You found the scarab?
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.060]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:36.880]  Dude!
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:39.540]  Overriding it.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.500]  Oh, we gotta wait.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.820]  Oh, they're gonna be so jealous when they see us, Eric.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.800]  There's another thing here.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.280]  It's just like a Humvee with a gun.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.180]  They're gonna be so pissed when they see this.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.340]  Is somebody a music guy?
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.380]  I do. It's okay.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.180]  It's not illegal.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.200]  It's not illegal?
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.140]  So you guys ran all the way to the end, then locked it.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:02.640]  Check it out!
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.760]  Holy shit!
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.860]  Dude! Is it a railgun on the top?
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:09.860]  Yeah, can you get in it or not?
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:10.740]  It's a fast turret.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.680]  Holy anus.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.260]  Andrew, we have to go back to where we were.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:16.740]  There's a tunnel.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.880]  Guys, there's like a Humvee car right over here.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.860]  You guys can take the standard vehicle.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.220]  Is there?
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:24.620]  Try.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.540]  Gavin, there's a nicer car over here with a turret.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:29.580]  Nothing, right?
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.740]  Nick, it's definitely not a nicer car.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:33.960]  Than the Jeep?
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.620]  Oh, what?
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.040]  Alright, fuck it.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.580]  And it boosts. It has a pulse.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:43.380]  Wow.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.020]  Are you coming?
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.020]  Yeah, I got run over.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.840]  Waiting for your team to escape.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:49.860]  Come on, Gavin!
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.460]  Alright, let's just drive.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:56.680]  Jesus!
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.300]  You guys are really holding us up here.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.580]  Yeah, no kidding. Come on, guys.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:02.860]  Who's this?
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.180]  There's men in the tunnel.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.040]  I think you better scare
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:08.720]  them a little bit.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.080]  I did.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.560]  Let's go!
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.140]  Ow!
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.120]  There you go.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:14.800]  We're here.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.680]  I'm going to jail, aren't I?
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:21.380]  For missing your meeting?
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.580]  Is that how you're meeting with the CPAs?
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.580]  When I don't pay the IRS.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.900]  Whoa, you guys look so cool.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.160]  Wow, nice driving.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.960]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.380]  Driving into a tree.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.120]  He's taking another mission.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:36.820]  I felt it was obvious.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.160]  The casino guys
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.060]  just called him, and he was like,
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.200]  I can stop on the way.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.140]  Wow, that looks so cool.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:46.920]  Oh, god.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.240]  What the ffff...
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.080]  Give him a little pulse.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.180]  Oh, no! Witness a dog!
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.520]  Oh, Jesus!
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.100]  I died.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.760]  Well, whatever.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:02.720]  Gavin, get in!
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.260]  Oh, thanks, Nick!
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:04.480]  Oh!
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.100]  Gavin just keeps...
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.920]  Dude, Gavin is just dying.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.660]  That guy lit up my back.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:13.300]  He gave me, like,
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.440]  19 new holes.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.640]  They ran you over and shot you in the neck.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.900]  Nick, pick me up. I'm ready.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.280]  Where are you? Oh, there you are.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.220]  Let's take this thing on-road.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.420]  Two minutes later than the time I told them.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:26.880]  Oh, no.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.840]  Oh, no.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.440]  So good.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.880]  Where are you going?
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.140]  Losing the cops.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.040]  Are the cops on us?
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:44.580]  Yep.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.280]  Oh, I don't have that.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.740]  Holy shit!
[01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:54.190]  Alright.
[01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.450]  Yeah, I don't have any stars. How weird.
[01:06:58.790 --> 01:06:59.510]  Implausible deniability.
[01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:01.150]  Are you guys up on the hill?
[01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:03.910]  Oh, yeah, you are. Oh, yeah. Andrew's trying to lose the cops.
[01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:04.990]  I saw you cresting.
[01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:06.190]  Yeah.
[01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:08.710]  Oh, we're gonna go right into this diner.
[01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:10.350]  Oh, no!
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.880]  You guys stopping for food?
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.940]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.340]  What's that?
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.240]  I might just give you the vehicle, because I have the wanted level, I think, personally.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:23.240]  Gavin!
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.520]  There's a farmer that got it there.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.900]  Are we still going the right way?
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep going.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.020]  Go to the music store.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.800]  You're just gonna keep going straight. You're gonna follow this road.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.400]  Just keep going.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.120]  The next exit that you're gonna take
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.900]  is gonna be on your left, but keep going.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.480]  I'll let you know when. Just keep going.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.440]  Oh, my God!
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.280]  Oh, no.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.200]  You just landed in water.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.300]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.260]  We're fine. It's an aquatic vehicle.
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.500]  I don't think that's true.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.420]  But the game was not
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.280]  designed to fail.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.520]  Gavin died.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.260]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.100]  These roads aren't meant for driving.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.120]  There's a helicopter?
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.320]  Okay, so now we go left?
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:14.340]  Keep going straight.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.840]  You're gonna get back on the main road.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.620]  I don't know where Gavin is.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.840]  I'm just behind you.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.600]  I feel so bad for Nick.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.220]  Keep going.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.000]  That's okay.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.340]  Keep going straight.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.580]  You're just gonna keep following this road.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.380]  What are you doing?
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:32.980]  Going straight!
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.440]  That was Nick!
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.020]  That was Nick!
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.000]  Good job, Nick.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.380]  Now he's fine.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.720]  He did an EMP to send him over.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.100]  Keep going straight.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.540]  Okay, yeah, but you're gonna take your...
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.760]  Keep going.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.580]  You're gonna turn left at...
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.260]  Not there.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.000]  This here.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.660]  Okay, there you go.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.420]  Now hop down.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.560]  Follow that road.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.100]  There you go.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:07.600]  Keep going straight.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.200]  You're just gonna keep following this.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.580]  Let me just go ahead
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.700]  and load up my zoom here.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:18.880]  Keep going.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:19.820]  You're just gonna keep going.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:20.340]  You're cruising.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.820]  You're gonna keep following this. Keep going.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.700]  Oh, you're trying to...
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.580]  Okay, I got it.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:30.700]  Oh, he's coming back, Andrew.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.740]  Just keep going.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.280]  Don't worry about streaming anymore, Nick.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.740]  To the right.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.500]  Okay, good, good. Keep going straight.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.680]  Keep going straight on the road.
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:41.680]  I'm good.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.080]  Keep going straight on the road.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.180]  It's coming up here on the left.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.020]  You're gonna keep going.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.700]  The dock is where we're taking it to.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.460]  Keep going straight.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:53.600]  Keep going to the right a little bit.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.240]  If you hop out...
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.500]  That's it. This is the spot.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.500]  Oh, I see it now.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.520]  Can I not get in the driver's seat?
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:02.940]  You gotta lose the cop.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.820]  There we go. I don't have the cops on me.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:06.620]  There.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.340]  I didn't have the cops on me at all.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.020]  That's weird.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.320]  Yep.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.660]  So Andrew just got out and we delivered the vehicle.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.540]  We did it.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.060]  There we go.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.140]  We did it.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.080]  So now can we buy that for ourselves?
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.880]  1, 2, 3.
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:27.580]  Nick, there's one more mission.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.520]  We have to plug in all the DJ equipment.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.240]  You gotta get a sound check.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:34.800]  There we go.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:35.960]  See, we're celebrating.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:36.820]  File complete.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:37.700]  Nice.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.220]  We did it.
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:39.600]  Wow.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.040]  1, 2, 3.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.020]  1, 2, 3.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.320]  1, 2, 3.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.020]  If I don't go to jail...
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:49.680]  No one did an outro.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:57.680]  Guys, thank you so much for watching this video.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.040]  This has been so great.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.100]  3, 2, 1.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.480]  Great stuff, guys.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.620]  You can resync with the others.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:05.780]  Bye!
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.840]  Go check out the podcast and go to Patreon.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.000]  We'll see you next time for more heists within heists that are outside of heists.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:14.600]  Bye!
