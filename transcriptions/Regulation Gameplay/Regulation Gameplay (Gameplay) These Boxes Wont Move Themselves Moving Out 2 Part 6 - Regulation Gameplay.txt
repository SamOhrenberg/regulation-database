[00:00.000 --> 00:05.920]  Welcome to a Regulation Gameplay! We're in Candyland and we're doing Regulation Candy Moving.
[00:06.500 --> 00:13.840]  Yeah! Is that good, Andrew? Yeah, I have proof. I'm licensed. I'm a candy mover. Where are we
[00:13.840 --> 00:19.040]  moving? In like a legal sense. Yeah, we're legally bonded in the state of Texas. Pixie Pusher. Hell yeah.
[00:20.460 --> 00:25.220]  We're having too much fun playing Moving Out, I think. It's great. It's so fun. You think we are?
[00:25.220 --> 00:31.620]  No, dude, it's so fucking fun. We're back to this? Oh no, we got more shooting. Oh wow, look, and they mixed up our teams. It's me and Andrew now.
[00:31.800 --> 00:39.220]  After we got so... Alright, Nick, we got this. Oh, we gotta shoot. Oh shit. Oh no, we're loading a house.
[00:39.280 --> 00:45.960]  Wait, we have to shoot it to like specific areas? Oh dear. Yeah. Let's just get this couch. Let's get
[00:45.960 --> 00:49.360]  the couch. Let's get this couch in here. Here you go, Geoff. Let's see what we got. Where do we get?
[00:49.420 --> 00:54.580]  Well, I'm gonna need some help. There we go. Okay, I think it's locked in. Okay. Couch goes to the top right.
[00:55.620 --> 01:00.840]  Hang on a little further back. There it goes. Look at that. Oh, I think we have to launch one
[01:00.840 --> 01:06.180]  of us over there. Hell yeah. Hang on, let's get this little one. Alright, okay. That goes...
[01:06.180 --> 01:09.800]  Where the fuck does that go? Oh, what the? Dude, I think that goes to the top left.
[01:10.760 --> 01:15.460]  I think we have to shoot that over to them. I think it might be in the kitchen.
[01:16.020 --> 01:19.380]  Oh no, we have to work together. Look, it's lit up green. Stuff lights up green.
[01:19.380 --> 01:25.540]  Oh, I see, I see. Because look, I don't think we can get it. I don't think we can get it over there.
[01:25.900 --> 01:30.080]  I think we have to give it to them. I guess we gotta just shoot it. No, hang on, hang on.
[01:30.220 --> 01:35.920]  Oh, we... No, there's a bridge. Just chuck it over. There's a bridge over there. Fire it and then we'll
[01:35.920 --> 01:41.160]  get over there. Wait, can we go over there? Yeah. Oh, wait, we have to launch ourselves. We gotta jump and...
[01:41.540 --> 01:48.500]  Oh, what? Oh, hey. Ready? I'm learning. Oh, feed me. I'm trying.
[01:49.580 --> 01:57.620]  Feed me. Fire, Geoff! Dude, that was perfect, Nick. Look at that. Damn, dude. That was wild.
[01:57.720 --> 02:03.860]  Oh, wait. Where does this go? There it goes. Just about anywhere. You can fire that on your own, I think, right?
[02:04.040 --> 02:08.900]  Yeah. Yep, yep. Okay. Anywhere you see it lit up green, Andrew, you can also hit Y. Yep.
[02:10.920 --> 02:17.180]  I got toilet for us. This is cool. I got... We gotta go all the way to the right for the toilet.
[02:17.180 --> 02:22.840]  But you can just put it up there, Andrew. If you guys just start launching your stuff over there,
[02:22.900 --> 02:26.280]  we can jump over and move everything around. Oh, I don't think it's in the spot.
[02:27.940 --> 02:32.120]  Let's try it. You think it is now? Maybe. Chair.
[02:34.280 --> 02:44.440]  Fuck. Come on. How do we... Oh, no. Get it. There we go. Bathroom. Oh, no. Oh, no. It's coming back.
[02:44.440 --> 02:50.520]  That worked. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. It's coming back. I didn't even get that. Oh, God. I also...
[02:52.120 --> 02:58.140]  Geoff, you just killed yourself. Ah, shit. What was that me? I thought that was you. No, it was you.
[02:58.260 --> 03:05.540]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Fire! Oh, no. Now what do I do? My wife got mad at me and closed my office door.
[03:06.080 --> 03:12.300]  Oh, really? Yeah, she's pissed. My wife slacks me to tell me to shut up. My wife slacks me?
[03:13.660 --> 03:19.900]  Shut the fuck up. Yeah. I can hear you. I'm in a meeting. I work for a university. What are you doing?
[03:20.180 --> 03:24.600]  She opened the door and started throwing things at me. Wow. She just wants people to listen to
[03:24.600 --> 03:30.000]  Clutch My Pearls? What the fuck? I'm not gonna say that. Wow. I can hear you. I heard her say it.
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.620]  She hates you. Yeah, what the fuck? Oh, this is a disaster. If I had a cake couch... Andrew,
[03:38.620 --> 03:43.560]  this is a tough one. We might have to start this over. I think this is the real problem for me.
[03:44.220 --> 03:47.900]  I think our heart was in the right place, but maybe our brains weren't.
[03:52.700 --> 04:07.020]  There we go. Oh, fuck off. Yeah. Okay, there we go. Ready, Andrew? Oh, we gotta go all the way
[04:07.020 --> 04:13.600]  up. Here we go. This is the last one on my side, Andrew, and then I'm coming.
[04:14.080 --> 04:19.780]  Okay, yeah, we'll pop over after this. Here it comes. Make sure nothing fires back at me. We're
[04:19.780 --> 04:25.160]  good. Daddy's in business. No, I fell in the water. Daddy's in business? That's what I keep
[04:25.160 --> 04:32.620]  trying to tell my son after the news. And your kid's like, your kid's like, no, dad, I saw the
[04:32.620 --> 04:41.920]  news. Daddy's most definitely not in business. Oh, no. Bonded and accredited in Texas. No!
[04:42.820 --> 04:49.320]  What was that? Uh-oh. Stuff is getting launched back. Andrew, I think we're in dire straits here.
[04:49.880 --> 04:53.960]  Yeah, it's a problem. Here comes a chair. Oh, here, let me... great. Let me see if I can...
[04:53.960 --> 05:00.200]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Come on, you little son of a... Okay, I got it. How do we get it on there?
[05:00.200 --> 05:06.180]  I don't know. Do we have to turn it? Oh, I got it. I got it. I think you did.
[05:06.840 --> 05:14.460]  There it goes. Right in, baby. Boom goes the dynamite. Oh, come on.
[05:16.360 --> 05:20.400]  All right, here comes... Sneak on through. Sneak on through. Here comes a sink or something.
[05:21.520 --> 05:26.800]  There we go. I got a... Yeah, nice. Hang on, we gotta move this couch. You got it? There we go.
[05:26.800 --> 05:31.980]  There we go. Come on, catch it. There we go. Yeah, there we go. Now we're... All right,
[05:32.020 --> 05:35.660]  Geoff. Okay, that can actually go over there, Andrew, because we don't have... There's nothing
[05:35.660 --> 05:40.420]  that's going to be blocked if you go... All right, we're good. Oh, no.
[05:42.420 --> 05:48.920]  Good. All right, team one has drowned. I repeat... What are we... Dude, this is...
[05:48.920 --> 05:54.920]  We gotta move that back up to the top there. That's fine. This chair is good. If it's colored
[05:54.920 --> 06:00.040]  in, it's in the right spot. All right, that'll get it out of the way, too. When you pick it up,
[06:00.180 --> 06:07.600]  it'll light up green with where it needs to go. Oh, okay. Andrew, that's so in the way.
[06:08.760 --> 06:14.060]  It's where it needs to be, though. I know. I understand that. What I'm saying is that we
[06:14.060 --> 06:19.080]  still have to go back and forth a lot. How do we... Take a step that way. Oh,
[06:19.100 --> 06:22.420]  that door doesn't open that way? Oh, what a worthless door. It does. Oh, it does. It does.
[06:22.420 --> 06:25.120]  Yeah, you just have to... Why is it opening for me? You just have to, you know, like, do it.
[06:25.140 --> 06:29.980]  There you go. God. Oh, all right, yeah. Makes total sense. Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay, there we go.
[06:31.820 --> 06:39.980]  You gotta angle it. There we go. Oh, the door broke. Oh, fuck that door. Good. All right,
[06:40.060 --> 06:44.020]  jump. Maybe... Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, good jump. Good call, Geoff. Good call. I forgot I
[06:44.020 --> 06:49.880]  could do that. Okay, so we don't have anything else in this side. I think we're... Everything's
[06:49.880 --> 06:56.300]  in the left. Andrew is really locked in. Andrew is so locked in right now.
[06:58.120 --> 07:03.580]  What are we missing? Why is my controller vibrating so much? If everything... If you
[07:03.580 --> 07:09.680]  see a gray thing on the ground, it needs to go... It needs to go to a spot. But where...
[07:10.880 --> 07:16.380]  Where does this go? Don't worry, guys, I got this one. Oh, this goes over there. It's all good.
[07:16.380 --> 07:23.840]  Stop. What are you doing? I'm keeping it locked down. You're locked in in a weird way.
[07:24.220 --> 07:31.040]  I'm locked into this. Just didn't go. I don't want to block the path. We've got 16 of 27 things.
[07:31.440 --> 07:36.220]  Yeah, we're gonna... This map kind of sucks. Why don't we just restart? No, I almost wonder...
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.640]  All right. How do we... Clearly... Yeah, let's... Hang on. Let's talk it... Let's form a plan.
[07:41.640 --> 07:48.960]  Yeah, I feel like we got to try to fill one room at a time. So, okay, so what if... What if Geoff
[07:48.960 --> 07:55.860]  and Nick on the left shoot stuff over? Me and Andrew can start moving things where it needs to
[07:55.860 --> 08:00.720]  go. And then when you guys are done there, go to the right and start shooting stuff over. Yeah,
[08:00.960 --> 08:03.800]  and I think that... Geoff, let's start with the two-handed. I'm sorry, go ahead, Nick.
[08:04.480 --> 08:08.180]  Okay, yeah, let's start with two. I was gonna say, I think if we're both pulling,
[08:08.180 --> 08:14.420]  we might be able to shoot to the right a little too. I think... You can try. Maybe. I mean,
[08:14.480 --> 08:17.300]  why not? We can try the angle. I say give it a shot. We'll just see, we'll just see. Let's just
[08:17.740 --> 08:20.520]  jam on that A button until we can start. All right, let's... Nick, let's get the couch.
[08:20.980 --> 08:24.020]  Let's get the couch. All right, Andrew, we're gonna... I'll go first. Hop on over. You're gonna
[08:24.020 --> 08:27.060]  send the couch over first? Eric, just get it over. Yeah, yeah, let's... Yeah, let's just do that.
[08:27.460 --> 08:31.760]  All right, perfect. It's in... And it's right there. I bet we can drop it in place, too.
[08:32.080 --> 08:36.120]  There we go. There it is, there it is. Nice. Close. Oh, look at that, Geoff. Ready? That was
[08:36.120 --> 08:40.520]  great. All the way. All right, now we'll do the big boy. Great. Now, now let's... Let's go to the
[08:40.520 --> 08:51.100]  top left and we'll start getting it in. All right, we got it. It's in. It's in. Andrew, we gotta...
[08:51.100 --> 08:56.420]  We gotta move this couch. All the way back. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna evaluate this bed.
[08:56.580 --> 08:58.720]  Okay. I'll be right there. All right, let's get this thing. You're good.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.020]  Nice. Good job, Eric. Come on. Yeah, but I gotta, like,
[09:05.340 --> 09:10.420]  fix it. There we go. It's gonna be in the way. Yeah, nice. Oh, well, I think I... Fucked it up.
[09:10.480 --> 09:14.580]  There we go, there we go, there we go. Where's this guy gonna go? See, he goes to the right,
[09:14.700 --> 09:18.460]  so can we move him? Yeah, it's fine. You think it'll make it. Just launch it over and we'll walk it.
[09:18.760 --> 09:22.000]  All right, we'll... We're gonna launch it over to you and you guys walk it. There you go. Boom.
[09:22.160 --> 09:27.720]  There you go. It's gonna take you some time. Don't die. Header. Header. All right, let's get this table.
[09:28.320 --> 09:31.780]  Okay. Over here. I'll go first. I think if we get these big, bulky things out of the way,
[09:31.780 --> 09:38.980]  we should be okay. Oh, that worked surprisingly well. Around. Come on. Okay, we got another...
[09:38.980 --> 09:42.600]  We got another... Here, why don't... Big, bulky thing for you guys. That table, you guys are
[09:42.600 --> 09:49.460]  gonna have to move. Here, let's... Pull my way, pull my way. Okay. Push the door so it's open.
[09:49.640 --> 09:53.860]  There it goes. Facing this way. All right, let's see if we can... Yeah. If you pull two...
[09:53.860 --> 09:57.040]  You pull two. There we go. Let's see if we can just put it in the bathroom. Come on. Boom.
[09:57.360 --> 10:00.560]  There we go. Oh, get in there. Get in there. We got that. All right. Perfect.
[10:02.740 --> 10:05.920]  Top left, Andrew, we'll grab this table. Oh, nice. That ruled, dude. Holy hell.
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.260]  There we go. I can't believe that worked. That was such good stuff. Now, I think this is a bottom
[10:12.260 --> 10:14.780]  left, Nick. Let's do the... Let's put him where he goes down there. Oh, I see where you're...
[10:14.780 --> 10:18.860]  Is it? No, no, he's not. He's not. You're right. Can we go all the way over? That's right there,
[10:18.860 --> 10:24.880]  though. All right, let's... Yeah, let's try that. Nice job. Oh, we blocked their way. Oh, no. Why'd
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.400]  you do that? Guys. You're being helpful. No, it's supposed to go bottom left. It's like...
[10:30.400 --> 10:35.660]  In the way. No, it doesn't. No, what we have is bottom left. That goes to the right of the
[10:35.660 --> 10:39.260]  bridge. Oh, okay. So, like, it's... Andrew, but you can't put it there. It's to the right,
[10:39.360 --> 10:43.600]  but it's just in the way. It's gonna be in the way. You can do it, actually. We gotta stop...
[10:43.600 --> 10:47.080]  No matter where... No matter where it is, though, right now, it's in the way,
[10:47.200 --> 10:50.380]  is what I'm saying. What a... What a shot, though. We'll have to move that one into the...
[10:50.380 --> 10:54.140]  Yeah, but... Give me a hand. The location's fantastic. Let's do this big, heavy one still.
[10:54.500 --> 10:56.500]  Oh, I just did this little guy... Oh, that's fine. Go ahead.
[10:58.300 --> 11:03.500]  Uh, where do you go? I hate this. Well, why did you put it there? Well, because no matter what,
[11:03.560 --> 11:06.360]  it was in the way. That's not true, because you could've left it over there. It would've
[11:06.360 --> 11:11.340]  been out of the way. All right, there you go. Oh, disagree. I got it. You're so wrong. You're
[11:11.340 --> 11:15.380]  just so wrong. Come on. You know what's wrong? It's just shooting at us. Oh, no, look, I dropped
[11:15.380 --> 11:19.060]  it out. That's what's wrong. Here, let me get it for you. There, fuck the door. Fuck that door.
[11:20.220 --> 11:26.300]  Nope. Oh, no. All right, we'll do your idea. Oh, come on. All right, there you go. You got it.
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.340]  I'm jumping. I'm jumping all I can. I got my little snowman arms fucking flying on my body.
[11:33.040 --> 11:36.540]  I just want you to know that when people watch this and they say you put that in the way,
[11:36.620 --> 11:40.900]  they're all gonna go, why did he do that? I didn't do that. I'm just letting you know what's
[11:40.900 --> 11:46.520]  going to happen, Andrew. I'm simply letting you know. I think you're wrong on that one. That's
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.700]  fine. That's a good shot. That's a good shot by them. Thank you. Where does this go? Oh, bottom.
[11:51.700 --> 11:58.660]  I don't know your bottom. It's right on that side. Here we go. There it goes. Let me just
[11:58.660 --> 12:06.920]  walk past this thing that's in the way. That's fine. Oh, I keep falling off. I'm going to hop
[12:06.920 --> 12:12.080]  to the other side and start doing stuff over there. You were saying I'm going to start over.
[12:16.360 --> 12:17.240]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[12:21.700 --> 12:26.280]  It does not want to cooperate with you. Give it the old hippo. I'll catch it. There we go.
[12:26.700 --> 12:34.820]  Caught. Locked in. Nice. Where's it supposed to go? Right here. Oh, nice. Got it. Good shot.
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.560]  All right, me and you, Nick. We got this thing. Yeah, hell yeah. Hit me with it. All right.
[12:39.340 --> 12:42.560]  We're the ultimate teams of two working independently.
[12:45.720 --> 12:50.280]  This is not... All right, Andrew, that one might need to move.
[12:52.260 --> 12:57.560]  Yeah, it does. I'm coming. I'm coming through. I'm coming through. I'm coming through. Oh, no.
[12:58.940 --> 13:02.460]  Excuse me. All right, well, that could have gone better, but it's fine. You're fine.
[13:04.400 --> 13:12.400]  Come on. Fuck this door. All right. Open fire. That one goes through.
[13:12.800 --> 13:19.380]  All right, that one made it. It's a door break. Thank you. There we go. How'd you do that?
[13:19.380 --> 13:25.840]  That was great. God bless America. Get on the heart, you stupid... There it goes. Everything's great.
[13:26.240 --> 13:32.540]  Another one. Put that right in the spot. Good. We're good. Doing all right. Oh.
[13:35.560 --> 13:43.540]  Is it this? No. Where does this go? Oh, I got it right on. I know. I saw that. That was pretty cool.
[13:44.340 --> 13:48.500]  All right, last one on my side. All right, come on over, Geoff. We got some double stuff over here.
[13:48.500 --> 13:55.900]  Okay. Oh, no. Geoff died. I threw that off the ledge. I died like you threw a toilet at me. There we go.
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.010]  That's mine. That'll teach you to die. I don't know where... I think these are metal. This goes...
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.340]  If you pick it up and put it down, it'll... Yeah, this... Okay, now it's just... They were green
[14:07.340 --> 14:11.540]  for me over here. Oh, no. Yeah. But where does this go? Oh, there. Okay, let's do this one.
[14:11.540 --> 14:18.600]  Waste this. Waste basketball time. Yee-haw! Is it? Dude, this looks... Here, I'll help you this time. Right.
[14:21.020 --> 14:26.800]  Oh, we're gonna run out of time. There we go. Okay, we're almost done. Get that chair in there.
[14:27.860 --> 14:34.600]  Yeah, we just missed it. No, it says almost. Oh, we did miss it. You're right.
[14:38.230 --> 14:42.810]  You're right. Oh, we should have aimed for the center. The bridge. Yeah, oh well. That's all right.
[14:44.850 --> 14:50.970]  Oh, now you guys aren't aiming for the center. I see how it is. There it goes. Just realized my
[14:50.970 --> 14:56.650]  controller has been vibrating this entire time, and I was wondering why. I don't know. It's stuck.
[14:56.770 --> 15:02.130]  There we go. All right. All right, let's get it right on the money, Geoff. You guys got it.
[15:04.670 --> 15:14.130]  What are you guys doing? Right on the money. What happened, Nick? I tried to let off the gas,
[15:14.570 --> 15:20.910]  and I did. Why? Because we were gonna launch it over the map. No! No, that's not enough.
[15:21.030 --> 15:25.770]  That's not enough. I mean, it's... Oh, it is. Oh, yeah. Here, Geoff, I'll launch you.
[15:27.090 --> 15:30.550]  Damn it. There we go. All right, you ready? Yeah, hold on.
[15:30.550 --> 15:34.830]  What are we doing? Oh, it's this. Damn it.
[15:37.270 --> 15:42.690]  Oh, it's going to the other side? Fuck. Hey, someone needs to move that chair back.
[15:44.410 --> 15:50.870]  Oh, this thing's over here, too. Oh, I threw it off the ledge. Chair in the top right.
[15:51.730 --> 15:56.410]  Yeah, see the chair? See how it needs to be in the spot? You can say no.
[15:58.730 --> 16:06.970]  All right. Didn't I just put a chair in that green spot? Oh my god, Geoff. I swear I did. Geoff,
[16:07.190 --> 16:12.330]  leave. Hey, there's a sink that I just chucked over there. Geoff, get out. I'm not doing anything.
[16:12.390 --> 16:17.050]  I'm just standing in a corner. Yeah, I know. And look at what you've done. I didn't do anything.
[16:17.270 --> 16:24.770]  You did all of this. I didn't do any of that. Look at the fucking tape. We got evidence. All
[16:24.770 --> 16:32.390]  of this got moved. Geoff came in and started moving the tape. All that had to happen was one
[16:32.390 --> 16:36.530]  chair needed to be moved in place. None of that is true. None of that is true. Oh no! Look at what
[16:36.530 --> 16:43.030]  you're doing. Why did you do that? Why are you guys all in the room that needed one chair moved
[16:43.030 --> 16:50.170]  and everything got fucked up? How did you do that? Hey man, I just parked the truck. The tape.
[16:52.030 --> 17:00.270]  Okay, we need to change our strategy. Oh yeah? What about it? I think
[17:02.250 --> 17:10.730]  we need to aim for... that's how you get across. You see that? Look, look. What? If you have
[17:10.730 --> 17:18.690]  something that needs to go to the left and you're on the right, you lock it in and then you aim for
[17:18.690 --> 17:29.650]  the awnings. You aim for... there you go. And so I'm gonna do that over here. Z missiles! There we go.
[17:32.010 --> 17:40.210]  This goes... see? So this goes to the left. So we're gonna aim for that awning. Oh come on!
[17:40.410 --> 17:46.470]  Just like this. Like that. And now... let's get the toilet where it is. Why did that awning retract?
[17:48.150 --> 17:54.310]  Do the awnings retract? Yes. How do you use them? They do. Oh, we missed that one. Oh no!
[17:54.850 --> 18:00.150]  Oh, just a bit. Just barely. Okay, I'm gonna run over there and tidy that up. Okay, I'm gonna keep
[18:00.150 --> 18:07.510]  watching for a second. Let me help you with that. Oh yeah, I'm stupid. And I hit that. Okay, here we go.
[18:07.650 --> 18:13.690]  Here we go. So it'll go over there. You see that? Boom. Yeah. That's the move. Awesome. So there it is.
[18:13.690 --> 18:18.130]  All right. Right there. Now we want to do all the way to the back, right?
[18:18.330 --> 18:22.530]  Yeah, just like that. We do the... Oh, how about this awning right here? Yeah. Go a little...
[18:23.130 --> 18:30.350]  A little what? Oh, that. You need to hit the awning that's just to the north of your mailbox.
[18:31.590 --> 18:38.410]  You need to hit this awning. All right, I think we got it. It might be easier to do with one person.
[18:38.410 --> 18:43.710]  Yeah, it definitely is. Yeah. All right, Jack, because we're fucking close. I'll help you.
[18:44.430 --> 18:50.930]  It's just fun on me. I'll give you a hand. It's fine. We'll... There you go. Let's spin. Let's back it up. Clockwise?
[18:51.290 --> 18:55.490]  Oh, yeah. That goes to the other side. Go ahead. I just don't have anywhere to go. There we go. Can you do the awning?
[18:55.730 --> 19:00.190]  I'm pulling it. Do the awning. Do the awning. It doesn't go there. It doesn't go there. I know, I know.
[19:00.290 --> 19:04.850]  I know. Oh. Okay. There we go. All right, well, that didn't work. On the other side. No, no. There we go.
[19:05.570 --> 19:11.050]  There we go. There we go. That should lock in. Does that lock in? There we go. That's what hap... No.
[19:11.190 --> 19:15.550]  I think I'll get the actual awning this time. You got the awning. Oh, I didn't know that. That's...
[19:15.550 --> 19:20.950]  Never mind then. I fucked that up. Yeah, that's okay. Boom. There you go. There we go. Nice. Close.
[19:22.450 --> 19:26.300]  All right, TB. This goes here. All right, the awning retracted though, so...
[19:27.270 --> 19:32.090]  Oh, it's... Okay, go ahead, Geoff. It's back. Well, if the awning retracted, then shoot for
[19:32.090 --> 19:39.250]  something that's on your side. Oh, Andrew, can you help me pull this for a second? Yep, yep. Gotcha.
[19:39.810 --> 19:47.470]  Right there. Yep, that's it. Nice. And this goes... That's the wrong side. This goes on our side.
[19:50.130 --> 19:53.430]  Okay, this also goes our side. Good. Our side.
[19:54.210 --> 19:57.630]  Middle. Okay, you gonna give me a hand with this? I think I can launch this by myself,
[19:57.630 --> 20:05.230]  but I gotta see. Let me see. Uh, no, I need your help. Okay. We're just gonna shoot for that awning right there.
[20:05.670 --> 20:12.310]  Geoff, I'm dropping this into the left room. Okay. Nice. It's a marshmallow pillow thing.
[20:13.570 --> 20:18.030]  This goes in the middle. Do you think we can just launch it to the middle from here?
[20:18.950 --> 20:21.770]  You think we're stronger? I don't think we're stronger. All right, I'm coming back, Nick.
[20:22.150 --> 20:26.910]  Uh, okay. I wonder if we can just... Yeah, I think we can just get it there. That's close enough. I felt like we missed
[20:26.910 --> 20:30.170]  on one of the thing, didn't we? The chair isn't in the right spot, Geoff.
[20:30.670 --> 20:33.030]  That thing needs to be pulled over there. Yeah, there you go. Okay.
[20:33.550 --> 20:36.430]  The chair's off. Oh, sorry about that. Sorry about that. What chair? That was on me.
[20:36.490 --> 20:41.270]  Uh, the chair at the bottom of the building there. Oh, I see. Yeah. That little rounded chair.
[20:43.450 --> 20:46.430]  Okay, here we go. Here we go. Hey, can you give me a hand with this one, Andrew?
[20:47.270 --> 20:51.370]  Oh, yep. God save. Where are we going? Oh, we need to move that table, I guess. Right there. That's it.
[20:51.770 --> 20:54.510]  Okay, and we'll do the same thing with this. Nick, stop drowning!
[20:56.310 --> 20:59.630]  Yeah, that's on our side as well. Yep, and this is the last that we have here.
[21:00.310 --> 21:03.390]  Yep, that's it. Oh, wait, there's a couple things I'm gonna move, Geoff.
[21:03.970 --> 21:09.830]  Oh, okay. Just so they're out of the way. Oh, grab that box. You can check by, uh, clicking Y.
[21:10.430 --> 21:15.670]  And it'll tell you. If you see that they're still designated something else, it's not the right spot. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[21:16.330 --> 21:18.070]  There we go. Okay. Good.
[21:19.070 --> 21:21.790]  Oh, hang on. Oh, did you see that? That was cool.
[21:21.790 --> 21:24.850]  That was pretty sweet. I'm just moving too fast on the small ones.
[21:25.610 --> 21:30.870]  All right, you got it? That's out of the way. Nice shot, Geoff. Something below it. This goes in the middle. All right, let's get this table next.
[21:33.130 --> 21:33.590]  What the?
[21:39.070 --> 21:41.250]  Come help. Oh, it's very heavy. Okay.
[21:43.030 --> 21:48.350]  You guys shooting the table over? Yeah, we're about to. Trying to, yeah. All right, here. Oh, wait, I got it. Oh, you got it. Yeah.
[21:49.270 --> 21:55.750]  Sink goes in. I got it. I got it, Andrew. What? Yeah! Holy hell, it worked. Oh, no! It worked!
[22:03.170 --> 22:03.890]  Oh, no.
[22:06.050 --> 22:12.630]  Yeah, sorry. No, no, it's fine. This is just... Captivated by them. This is the thing that blocked the table from going over.
[22:12.950 --> 22:15.470]  There you go. All right, Geoff, that was pretty cool. I'm gonna be honest. That was pretty cool.
[22:15.990 --> 22:18.790]  We have a couple of chairs here. These go here.
[22:19.410 --> 22:20.750]  Where does this get locked in?
[22:22.570 --> 22:27.290]  Oh, it's on the, uh, other side. Oh, really? Damn. I thought we were really good about that.
[22:29.530 --> 22:33.050]  Hey, Nick, will you come over and help me pull after you do that? I got you. I got you. I got you.
[22:33.350 --> 22:34.970]  Okay. Me and you. All the way back.
[22:36.310 --> 22:40.270]  Right on the money thing. Everyone's over there. That's it. Remember, press Y to see the things that, uh...
[22:41.290 --> 22:46.990]  Are out of place. Are out of place. There's... I got one thing on the right over here, but I don't know where it goes.
[22:47.550 --> 22:48.550]  Oh, I know where this goes.
[22:49.310 --> 22:54.150]  What is this? Oh, oh, oh, this is that thing that gets in the fucking way. Andrew, will you give me a hand with this?
[22:54.810 --> 22:55.030]  Yep.
[22:55.770 --> 22:57.150]  Oh, my. Oh, Andrew.
[22:58.330 --> 22:58.690]  Sorry.
[22:59.910 --> 23:00.750]  Okay, we're back.
[23:01.350 --> 23:05.950]  Uh, we're almost done. Oh, we just missed it. Yeah, but we're gonna miss it. We did already. Yeah.
[23:06.850 --> 23:08.910]  Yeah, but we're getting closer.
[23:10.270 --> 23:15.810]  What are we... I'm trying to think of what we can do to speed this up. I can't get this the fuck through.
[23:16.570 --> 23:17.690]  Oh, my god.
[23:19.430 --> 23:20.110]  There we go.
[23:20.790 --> 23:22.810]  Where does this go? That's it. Oh, I see.
[23:23.610 --> 23:30.370]  Got it. Nice. Okay, so that's it. So we're close. I feel like our strategy is good. We definitely need to
[23:30.830 --> 23:34.230]  make sure what's going on the left is on the left and what's going on the right is on the right.
[23:35.530 --> 23:38.990]  First and foremost. Andrew, I really liked... Let's...
[23:39.790 --> 23:40.830]  me and you...
[23:41.710 --> 23:43.730]  Let's launch our two
[23:44.290 --> 23:51.510]  person job stuff first and then we'll do... and then you go over there. We'll start getting it set and then we'll get the singles stuff.
[23:52.450 --> 23:57.430]  Yeah, we'll start with doubles as well. So we'll do singles as last. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, we'll do doubles first.
[23:57.490 --> 24:00.710]  So let's start with this big couch. You want to get on the top side. I'll get on this back side.
[24:00.870 --> 24:04.390]  I will. Yeah, I'll get in the opposite. Yeah, we'll start with the couch too, Geoff. There we go.
[24:04.770 --> 24:07.730]  This is great. Locked in. Nice. Perfect. Locked in. That's great.
[24:07.730 --> 24:10.670]  We'll just get it right where it goes all the way. There we go.
[24:11.390 --> 24:15.210]  Oh, it works perfect. This is two people. This is two people.
[24:16.370 --> 24:19.290]  Okay, you're gonna get the big heavy. Yeah, let's get the big heavy shit.
[24:20.310 --> 24:24.850]  The things that are the most pain in the ass to move around. Okay, so that one we need to... Okay, this one I'll do.
[24:28.150 --> 24:33.230]  Oh, wait. Sorry. That's okay. There you go. There we go. That should do it. Let's...
[24:33.230 --> 24:40.950]  Oh, perfect. Oh, wow. Oh, man. It was almost in place. All right, let's get the bed. Yeah, get in the bed.
[24:42.290 --> 24:47.750]  The chair goes to the left, so we got to hit the awning. Yes. So bring it back a little bit. Nope. Two. Did it go?
[24:48.590 --> 24:52.230]  All right, let's just sit at home. Nope. A little more left. There we go.
[24:53.490 --> 24:57.910]  All right, let's toilet it. It's fine. It's actually not that heavy. Oh, against the wall. That's really out of the way. That's perfect.
[24:58.710 --> 25:00.350]  Get this right there. There we go.
[25:01.050 --> 25:06.830]  Oops, sorry. Sorry. That's my bad. Hit the awning. Yes, there it goes. All right, let's get it. Oh my god.
[25:08.110 --> 25:15.510]  Yes, I think we nailed that. Yes. Oh, nice toilet shot. All right, man. I don't ever want to hear someone say that again.
[25:18.050 --> 25:23.850]  Okay, one door broken. Yes. I'm gonna need your help with this one. All right, I'll do this by myself over there. Yep, yep.
[25:25.190 --> 25:28.290]  I'm on my way. Okay, nice shot. I need help launching a couple of things.
[25:29.090 --> 25:30.170]  There it goes.
[25:32.250 --> 25:36.750]  Oh, no. All right. Well, it's where it needs to be, I guess. Okay. Well, we gotta launch this.
[25:36.970 --> 25:39.930]  Well, I guess we're gonna send the table over since they sent it to us.
[25:40.810 --> 25:44.810]  Uh, yeah, you're welcome. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. I'll let go. Just let go. Yep.
[25:46.030 --> 25:49.870]  Oh, fuck the lid. Okay. No, it's fine. We got it. We're good. Nope. Not locked in.
[25:50.050 --> 25:55.870]  Yeah, I got it. I'll let you grab it. Where's this guy? Okay, so this one is the bottom left guy.
[25:55.870 --> 25:59.330]  Okay, there we go. He's fighting. He's not in the way. No, he's not.
[25:59.470 --> 26:03.870]  All right, and then we have this thing goes in the middle. I'll get him.
[26:04.330 --> 26:10.170]  Yeah, you got him. Let's see if I can squeeze that. Oh, fuck. Right about there. Small thing. That should be good.
[26:11.370 --> 26:15.390]  Yeah, perfect. It didn't hit the thing. Oh, okay, but how do we get it there?
[26:15.890 --> 26:19.490]  Let's do that guy last because that's the one that always gets in the way. Yeah, absolutely.
[26:20.110 --> 26:21.890]  Back left. Yeah.
[26:22.230 --> 26:24.370]  All right, ready? And yeah.
[26:24.370 --> 26:31.650]  Okay, all the way back. Hang on. Hang on. Don't let go. Don't let go. Yeah. Yeah, that's all the two. Okay, let's go.
[26:31.730 --> 26:34.530]  I'm gonna pop over there and move some stuff around. Get there. God damn it.
[26:34.670 --> 26:39.830]  Nope, and I'll start doing the single player stuff for those. Okay, it's really not that heavy. Why don't we just shoot it up front?
[26:40.030 --> 26:43.790]  Yeah, it's fine. I just wanted to get it out of the way because it goes in like the direct middle.
[26:44.530 --> 26:50.550]  Yeah, if you want to shoot in front of the awning. The front awning. You're saying like right down there. Yeah, right there.
[26:50.910 --> 26:51.590]  Yeah, right there.
[26:52.350 --> 26:56.570]  Dude, you've got to be kidding me. How did that happen? He fucking hates this.
[26:58.690 --> 27:02.310]  Why don't you go over and start setting stuff up because the rest of this is cool.
[27:06.310 --> 27:08.010]  Dude, the awning came back!
[27:11.230 --> 27:15.870]  Right? I'm like, oh great. This is good. The awning's gone. I can just shoot it over. It came back right when I shot it.
[27:16.490 --> 27:17.650]  Aim more left, Eric.
[27:18.350 --> 27:21.470]  Yeah, no, I know. The awning came back. I'm waiting for it to go away.
[27:22.030 --> 27:22.430]  Right.
[27:25.110 --> 27:27.230]  Aim more left. Are that doors? Thanks, man.
[27:28.470 --> 27:34.170]  I'm helpful. Yeah, you're doing it. Kitchen table chair. This is going to be in the way here, but...
[27:38.010 --> 27:41.150]  Here, your awning's going down. Oh, it goes to the other side. There it goes.
[27:44.730 --> 27:47.930]  Let me make sure. Where the fuck is this? Oh, okay.
[27:47.930 --> 27:52.130]  Where does this go? It must be... oh, it's on the left.
[27:54.490 --> 27:55.970]  God damn it. Pick it up!
[27:57.230 --> 27:58.430]  Fucking dumb thing.
[28:00.030 --> 28:02.790]  What the hell is this go? Oh, okay.
[28:03.870 --> 28:04.650]  Lock in.
[28:06.230 --> 28:08.590]  God bless America. Get out of the way!
[28:09.990 --> 28:12.910]  Not you, Andrew. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, I know.
[28:14.830 --> 28:15.750]  Where does... okay.
[28:19.030 --> 28:22.710]  Andrew, you want to help me? This goes a little bit up. Yep. Let's just move it up a little bit.
[28:25.290 --> 28:33.710]  What? Okay, I'm almost done with furniture on my side here. I don't understand. The last thing, it's a chair. Oh, okay.
[28:35.430 --> 28:40.290]  All right, got the toilet. Hey, can I get... Nick, can I... or can I get somebody to help me? I've got it.
[28:40.750 --> 28:41.490]  All right, thanks.
[28:42.370 --> 28:43.410]  So I put this guy in place.
[28:45.510 --> 28:45.790]  Perfect.
[28:45.910 --> 28:47.090]  Perfect. I got back quick. Back left.
[28:47.390 --> 28:50.810]  Okay, now that we have everything on the left and the left and the right on the right,
[28:51.050 --> 28:53.310]  I'm gonna put this thing in the middle. We have one more thing, okay?
[28:54.090 --> 28:58.830]  Because we're going to... everything's gonna get in the way of it and we have to get it there. Let go. Let go.
[29:00.490 --> 29:02.250]  All right, here we go.
[29:06.060 --> 29:06.980]  You hit the awning on that?
[29:07.960 --> 29:08.520]  Good work.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.360]  Cool. Thank you. Oh, that did not go where I wanted it to go. No, no, that's where it needs to go. That needs to go...
[29:14.360 --> 29:19.520]  That should go out first. Yeah, Andrew, you can... there you go. I got you, Andrew. Oh, Geoff, you need a hand? You good?
[29:20.300 --> 29:23.640]  I'm, just trying to figure out what's out of place. I'm gonna move this.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.580]  Uh, a gray... yeah, a gray box at the bottom. This one here.
[29:29.020 --> 29:31.780]  Got you, Nick. Yeah, thank you. It needs to go on the other side.
[29:32.980 --> 29:36.800]  Got that. Great. All right, we just have small little things over here. Oh, God.
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.640]  Oh, God. There we go. Hey, whoever's holding something needs to have stuff come over here. Oh, fuck me. No!
[29:42.060 --> 29:42.700]  I'm bringing it.
[29:45.020 --> 29:51.960]  All right. No, no, no. Yeah, you got it. I'm trying to get it locked in. I see. Okay, there's nothing else on the left.
[29:52.440 --> 29:55.700]  Everything's on the right. Come on. It's chairs.
[29:56.220 --> 29:57.500]  I got that.
[29:58.720 --> 30:01.220]  It's... Grab that. There's one on the left. That goes...
[30:01.220 --> 30:05.320]  That goes here. Get in there. Get in there. Land. Yes! Nailed it.
[30:06.040 --> 30:06.440]  This.
[30:07.260 --> 30:12.260]  One thing. Oh, no, there's one over in the truck. We just missed... Oh, what the fuck?
[30:12.780 --> 30:15.460]  Oh, it's hidden. Something respawned. No!
[30:15.460 --> 30:17.380]  I think something fell off and respawned.
[30:17.940 --> 30:18.300]  No!
[30:19.140 --> 30:20.740]  Yeah, we just missed it.
[30:21.400 --> 30:24.180]  No! It's not over yet. Fire. Fire the cannon.
[30:25.700 --> 30:28.800]  You got to move that chair up, bud. Move that chair into place, Andrew.
[30:29.920 --> 30:30.180]  Yep.
[30:30.860 --> 30:32.060]  Oh, God. Go!
[30:32.460 --> 30:34.940]  Up. North. Up. There you go.
[30:37.160 --> 30:39.600]  What did we do on time? Did we improve on our time, at least?
[30:39.600 --> 30:43.820]  I think so. I think it's... I think it's equivalent. I think we only missed it by, like, 30 seconds.
[30:44.220 --> 30:49.280]  We missed about, like, 26 seconds last time, I think, so... Did we? Oh, then we're probably, like, right on the same...
[30:54.480 --> 30:55.120]  6.33.
[30:56.260 --> 30:57.560]  Missed it by...
[31:00.340 --> 31:03.940]  We do that one again or we save it? No, we do that again. One more time.
[31:04.500 --> 31:08.100]  We got it. We got this, right? The audience wants to see us succeed.
[31:09.140 --> 31:12.480]  I don't know if that's necessarily true, but I appreciate it.
[31:16.220 --> 31:23.180]  We're just gonna go pick up this eye real fast. Oh, we're moving? Oh, what we got? We got another style crate, maybe?
[31:25.980 --> 31:28.080]  Can't make a move without smashing some eggs, right?
[31:29.080 --> 31:31.480]  What? You found a human eye! Yeah!
[31:32.080 --> 31:33.480]  Oh, God. Those are eggs.
[31:34.280 --> 31:35.160]  Hail Caesar!
[31:35.160 --> 31:35.340]  Hail Caesar!
[31:37.520 --> 31:38.520]  I don't like it.
[31:40.800 --> 31:45.260]  So, I think the exact same thing we did last time, two pieces. Yeah, we just had to be a little faster.
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.880]  I mean, we would have been fine if that one piece
[31:49.020 --> 31:50.580]  was, like, locked in. It would have been fine.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.160]  There were a couple of little boxes that were on the wrong side.
[31:54.380 --> 31:57.880]  So we just need to watch out for those. Is this the one? Because I think we're both picking up the same...
[31:57.880 --> 32:00.880]  Yes. Yeah. We're both picking up the same looking thing at the same time,
[32:00.940 --> 32:04.160]  but they go in different rooms that are these little tiny ones. Okay.
[32:06.140 --> 32:11.740]  I mean, I think everything went where it belonged this time for the most part. Yeah. Like, it really is just an efficiency.
[32:12.700 --> 32:15.280]  Yep. All right, Andrew, let's move this couch. An efficiency apartment? Yep.
[32:16.680 --> 32:18.220]  Oh, no. There we go. There we go.
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.280]  Locked in. Oh, God. Geoff, we're... Shooter, shooter. Andrew, all the way back.
[32:24.160 --> 32:27.180]  Uh-huh. There we go. Oh, well. Let's get this one. You died for...
[32:28.700 --> 32:34.560]  You get that. Nice. Okay. It's bad. Okay. I'm actually gonna put this down here.
[32:36.920 --> 32:37.640]  Okay. Oh.
[32:41.140 --> 32:42.080]  Ah! Perfect.
[32:43.620 --> 32:45.980]  Need a hand with it? No, I think...
[32:45.980 --> 32:47.340]  What the? Oh, Geoff, you're not on the thing.
[32:48.160 --> 32:52.000]  I was. Let's get this croissant couch. Boom. Nice. There we go.
[32:52.600 --> 32:54.680]  All right. Toilet time. That goes on our side.
[32:55.440 --> 32:56.700]  Well, come on. Lock it in.
[32:57.320 --> 32:58.840]  Locked in. You can shoot it.
[33:01.420 --> 33:04.040]  To the right. But now! Make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
[33:04.120 --> 33:06.660]  You got it. All right. This goes... Nailed it.
[33:07.180 --> 33:12.000]  Lock in. There we go. Let's do this big, big... Oh, what's that? Oh, yeah. Let's just get this table. There's that.
[33:13.560 --> 33:17.040]  Although... Yeah, it doesn't matter. Sink can go on our side. That's fine.
[33:18.640 --> 33:21.620]  Okay. Okay. This is all, like, single... Yeah, yeah. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good.
[33:22.720 --> 33:24.900]  Oh, please get over the thing. Oh, thank God.
[33:25.160 --> 33:28.760]  Uh, I'm gonna have to shoot this low because the awning is gonna... You're right.
[33:28.760 --> 33:31.300]  Let's get this here. I got it. I got it. I got a piece of chocolate cake.
[33:34.600 --> 33:36.960]  Where does this go? What the fuck is wrong with me, Nick?
[33:39.340 --> 33:39.660]  Go.
[33:41.640 --> 33:45.420]  It's my fucking hands don't work. All right. Oh, you do this one. You do this one.
[33:45.560 --> 33:49.280]  That should be perfect. Nice shot. Yeah.
[33:52.480 --> 33:53.220]  Here we go.
[33:53.640 --> 33:55.100]  There we go, Geoff.
[33:55.940 --> 33:58.040]  Uh-oh. Andrew, that goes in the top and I'd wait on that.
[33:58.040 --> 34:01.580]  Oh, no, no, no. Actually, you're right. That's the middle. Yeah, no, you're right. There we go. Oh.
[34:02.600 --> 34:07.040]  I'll get this one. All right. Are you a part of the table now? Yeah. Okay.
[34:08.300 --> 34:09.380]  Hey. Oh, no.
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.440]  Oh, we fucking... We found a shortcut. Can you move that out of the window?
[34:15.720 --> 34:19.920]  Yeah. Like where I'm shooting. There's just a... Yeah. It's in the way and I'm worried.
[34:20.660 --> 34:25.080]  It's gonna block everything. There we go. But I got it. You go ahead.
[34:25.080 --> 34:26.940]  Okay. There we go.
[34:27.740 --> 34:33.120]  Okay, that should be it. Let's see. You're right. You're right to be concerned. That's the one that gets out of... That's what I thought was gonna... Nice shot.
[34:33.580 --> 34:36.440]  All right, so that one's a pain in the ass. We'll save that one. Let's do this one, Geoff.
[34:36.600 --> 34:41.400]  Okay. So we get this one out of the way. I know it's a two-person, but I appreciate you doing that. Thank you.
[34:42.060 --> 34:44.200]  Oh, God. This is my last...
[34:44.200 --> 34:47.700]  piece here. I'll get this one. That is for sure my last piece. I just checked.
[34:48.220 --> 34:51.660]  Coming over to you, Andrew, and I'll help with the... Fire. I'll help with the pieces.
[34:52.640 --> 34:56.440]  Okay. Oh, come on. We'll move. Okay, you get that position. Well, that was unfortunate. Let's get...
[34:57.140 --> 34:59.880]  No, no, no, the table. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. We're good.
[35:00.500 --> 35:01.340]  Get on the other side.
[35:01.820 --> 35:02.640]  There you go. Yep.
[35:03.960 --> 35:07.220]  Okay, so it's all the way up. How am I gonna continue to do that?
[35:08.580 --> 35:14.240]  Uh, how are we doing this here? All right, you got this one. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, just like that. Nice. Good work.
[35:14.420 --> 35:15.040]  There we go.
[35:15.380 --> 35:17.900]  Okay, so we got a chair here.
[35:18.740 --> 35:19.860]  Yeah, you got that one.
[35:19.860 --> 35:21.300]  Got this one.
[35:22.080 --> 35:22.440]  That.
[35:23.140 --> 35:25.140]  All right, this one's a pain in the ass, so...
[35:25.140 --> 35:29.400]  Oh, oh, that goes in that green spot right there. Let's save this one for last. Yeah, he should... I think he's last.
[35:29.940 --> 35:31.160]  What's in a weird spot?
[35:31.960 --> 35:33.120]  Oh, okay. Oh, it's this.
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.420]  And this goes over there. Okay, this goes on this side. Hey, will you, uh...
[35:39.680 --> 35:42.740]  Oh, yeah, sorry. Here, let's do this one together, Geoff. All right.
[35:44.640 --> 35:46.680]  We'll get it back left corner there.
[35:48.000 --> 35:48.640]  Fire away.
[35:50.240 --> 35:50.880]  Nice shot!
[35:51.680 --> 35:56.520]  Thank you. I got it. All right, let's see where this one goes, too. Eric, stay right there. Yeah, yeah, you're good.
[36:00.180 --> 36:04.520]  I gotta launch that one short, but it goes in that back left corner. Got it. Outside the door.
[36:07.080 --> 36:08.420]  Okay, one door broken.
[36:10.960 --> 36:14.260]  We shouldn't have to take much left and right, Andrew. I think we should be good.
[36:15.200 --> 36:16.920]  Okay. I got...
[36:17.380 --> 36:18.920]  Let's do this one guy real fast.
[36:22.700 --> 36:25.880]  I wonder what that area that we unlocked is.
[36:26.480 --> 36:28.580]  There's that. There we go.
[36:29.600 --> 36:35.600]  Okay, you... I'll help you just in case. Right here, I think. Yeah, boom. That should be good. There you go. That should be plenty.
[36:36.460 --> 36:40.740]  Not enough that guy. Okay, that should be... so we're missing one piece on the right side. I got you.
[36:41.240 --> 36:43.040]  It's coming your way. Nick's got you.
[36:43.040 --> 36:47.040]  And I got this coming. And then this thing needs to go also on the right side. That's locked in.
[36:47.260 --> 36:50.400]  And then that goes to the top right also. Yeah.
[36:51.140 --> 36:52.640]  All right, this one you got, Geoff.
[36:52.820 --> 37:06.120]  Oh, no! Yeah, that's what I was worried about.
[37:07.020 --> 37:09.060]  This is... that's gonna be really hard to get.
[37:10.380 --> 37:14.460]  That's our last piece in this spot. Nick, you need to get down there. I need some help.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.560]  I don't know. Hang on. You think you can throw it and we can catch it? Fuck!
[37:20.980 --> 37:25.820]  Maybe. Wait, wait, wait, left. We can launch it far. Left, left, left. Yeah, oh yeah, we can put it. Just put it. Right there. Fire!
[37:27.880 --> 37:29.520]  Make it. Make it. Yeah!
[37:31.460 --> 37:33.300]  Oh my god! What a shot!
[37:35.980 --> 37:43.340]  Ten out of ten. That fucking rocked. What a shot. Oh my god. Can't wait for that Yelp review.
[37:43.880 --> 37:44.280]  Wow!
[37:47.380 --> 37:47.780]  Unbelievable!
[37:49.220 --> 37:52.940]  Holy hell. How much time did we have left over? Holy shit. Yeah!
[37:53.660 --> 37:58.480]  Dude, wow. We beat it by almost a full minute. By a minute and 15 seconds. Yeah. Wow!
[37:58.660 --> 38:03.540]  We're like, we improved our time by a minute and 15 seconds. That's fucking great. Dude, we team crushed. That was awesome.
[38:03.640 --> 38:04.980]  That was awesome. Where did it go?
[38:05.440 --> 38:07.360]  Off. Smash all the trees. I wonder what that was.
[38:09.780 --> 38:13.040]  Dude, that was awesome. Yeah, there were trees in that map. That was great. Good run.
[38:13.600 --> 38:14.000]  Woo!
[38:14.780 --> 38:15.720]  Oh my god.
[38:17.280 --> 38:19.640]  I'd love to play one little mini game. Yeah. Yeah.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.400]  Maybe find a little, like, any mini games are in here? Any more of those shooting things? What is this? What's that?
[38:27.020 --> 38:29.540]  That looks like a mini game. Slice and choppy.
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.240]  Gumball. Gumball. Gumball. We got a contract filling in at a factory helping them sort candy.
[38:36.100 --> 38:37.060]  If anyone asks, you have to...
[38:38.220 --> 38:40.300]  I don't know why you're reading, man. Just hit the buttons.
[38:40.920 --> 38:42.160]  I think we want to do this, right?
[38:44.160 --> 38:46.460]  We'll give it a go. Let's just do it.
[38:49.820 --> 38:54.980]  Something about sorting? Oh god. Man, when we're done with this, I'm gonna take the biggest victory shit. I'm so tired.
[38:56.720 --> 38:59.660]  Oh, it's like Pachinko? With moon balls.
[39:00.520 --> 39:03.860]  That's fucking awesome. All right. How do you load it? Oh, you load it on the...
[39:05.520 --> 39:10.840]  You load it over here. Does it? Yep. Wait, it's that? Is that what it is?
[39:13.380 --> 39:18.740]  Is this? What? Are we doing it right? Are we done? This doesn't feel right. I don't know what's happening.
[39:19.040 --> 39:24.600]  How'd that get up there? Oh, hang on. We got to move purples to purple and orange to orange, I think.
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.320]  I think these other balls are to trick you. What?
[39:32.320 --> 39:33.940]  Look, purple goes in purple.
[39:36.300 --> 39:42.320]  Um, but they change when they hit and they have to... it has to land in one of these things
[39:42.880 --> 39:46.320]  and then you walk on it to open it and then you take it over there.
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.420]  Wait, there's an orange in the purple. No, it's it's not orange. Oh, you're right. Well, hey, orange is tricky.
[39:56.180 --> 39:56.960]  Oh, that's rare.
[39:58.260 --> 39:59.040]  There's orange.
[40:00.040 --> 40:00.360]  Okay.
[40:02.260 --> 40:06.180]  There we go. What the fuck is that? How the hell are we supposed to... oh no!
[40:08.660 --> 40:10.040]  Get the orange back in there.
[40:12.320 --> 40:15.700]  I don't... what does this polar... I'm still so confused. Let's find out.
[40:15.960 --> 40:19.700]  I don't...
[40:20.600 --> 40:23.520]  I don't understand. Wait, do we have to just...
[40:24.380 --> 40:30.920]  You feed the balls! Feed the balls! So you just feed it into the... so you do feed it into the middle. Feed the balls!
[40:32.820 --> 40:37.620]  Let go. Let go. Thank you. Jesus Christ.
[40:41.440 --> 40:42.720]  Orange, you got it.
[40:43.720 --> 40:48.760]  Stay in there, you little son of a bitch. So we have to do this with all of them then, huh? I guess so.
[40:50.340 --> 40:57.380]  And then if it goes in the middle, it washes the... yeah, it washes like the color away. So just keep doing that.
[40:58.760 --> 40:59.160]  Okay.
[41:04.240 --> 41:06.340]  Got an orange coming. Got an orange coming. Purple!
[41:06.340 --> 41:11.500]  But we're like out of room. I don't know how. Yeah. We're getting close to what?
[41:11.700 --> 41:16.480]  Oh no! So we have to do 16 total? How? Well, we've done 13.
[41:18.320 --> 41:19.700]  Why is there a purple over here?
[41:22.040 --> 41:28.100]  Maybe it bounced. 13? I don't understand how we're going to fit all of these. Just stand still.
[41:31.900 --> 41:33.880]  Yeah, I'm holding these in place.
[41:34.880 --> 41:37.200]  No! Get in there! No!
[41:40.200 --> 41:40.560]  No!
[41:41.740 --> 41:43.460]  We only got one more that we have to. No!
[41:45.020 --> 41:48.120]  You keep dealing with that. I'll see if I can get this one. Get it. All right.
[41:48.600 --> 41:52.580]  Well, I mean, now we know what to do, but I need to know what it's like at the end. Great.
[41:52.760 --> 41:55.880]  Fucking kidding me? Get in there, you stupid...
[41:59.940 --> 42:02.340]  Get it, Nick. Don't wash! Don't! God damn it.
[42:04.300 --> 42:05.960]  It doesn't come out, like, right away.
[42:07.420 --> 42:13.160]  All right, we're good. Okay. Yeah, you guys hold on there. I'm just holding it in. We'll see what this last one is. I can't move.
[42:13.320 --> 42:14.100]  No, no, don't move.
[42:16.160 --> 42:19.360]  You did it! Go to purple! Go to purple! Go to purple! Thanks, man.
[42:21.180 --> 42:21.860]  I'll help you.
[42:23.120 --> 42:26.240]  Yay! Oh, I snagged it. Okay. Okay, so that's what it is.
[42:26.460 --> 42:33.300]  Um, so once we get to a certain amount in there where they won't stay in, we just need designated people.
[42:33.300 --> 42:36.000]  Uh, to hang out and hang on.
[42:36.300 --> 42:40.180]  Um, I think this will be a lot faster. Yeah, I agree. Um, okay, let's do it again.
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.820]  What's our best time? Proton? Oof. Okay, we got this. Two times, that's easy. Well, yeah, we spent the first...
[42:45.820 --> 42:50.300]  We didn't know what we were doing for the first two minutes. Yeah, we spent so much time going, what are we doing?
[42:50.780 --> 42:56.080]  Yeah. All right. So someone can wait in the middle and catch the ball. Any white ball, grab it and put it in. No!
[42:56.360 --> 43:00.440]  No! We don't need your shitty life story, get to the game! God damn it!
[43:01.380 --> 43:04.440]  Stop trying to have a story! Stop!
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.460]  Fucking nerds. Don't worry, we're headed back.
[43:09.540 --> 43:11.760]  No loading times. It's pretty fast.
[43:15.900 --> 43:20.820]  Yeah, I don't even remember how you... I do. Go up here.
[43:23.320 --> 43:29.160]  Oh, there you go. Nice. I think it's up. I was right behind. You're driving away from it. Oh, aren't you?
[43:30.560 --> 43:35.640]  I think it's the very first one. The struts. Yeah. All right, get moving, we got this.
[43:38.180 --> 43:38.980]  Easy. Easy.
[43:40.540 --> 43:42.300]  Let's throw those balls in.
[43:43.180 --> 43:46.480]  It's gonna be... get them colored. Fucking ball city over here. All right, let's do it.
[43:46.720 --> 43:50.500]  I'm going for these in front. Here we go. I'm gonna get the one all the way on the left. Go!
[43:50.520 --> 43:53.780]  I'll be Lamello. Somebody has to be Lonzo.
[43:54.780 --> 43:55.180]  Uh...
[43:55.180 --> 43:58.240]  Eric has to be the dad. I'm the dad.
[43:59.400 --> 44:02.040]  Everyone likes me. I'm the nice one.
[44:02.940 --> 44:10.460]  Oh, Jesus. We need to get all the white balls out. Yeah.
[44:16.350 --> 44:17.970]  Get you out of the way.
[44:18.990 --> 44:20.410]  Get you out of the way.
[44:21.490 --> 44:22.830]  Get you out of the way.
[44:23.270 --> 44:24.910]  We have a bunch in the right tube still.
[44:25.950 --> 44:29.450]  I'll start... I'll start pulling them. Yeah, start pumping them. I'll snag them.
[44:29.450 --> 44:29.770]  Oh.
[44:31.510 --> 44:34.210]  There's not a run faster button, is there? Nope.
[44:36.310 --> 44:37.190]  Can you try jumping?
[44:38.630 --> 44:41.110]  I'm in a wheelchair. You can also throw the balls.
[44:42.590 --> 44:44.850]  God bless America. Stop turning white.
[44:45.670 --> 44:46.910]  Oh, look at that. Did you see that?
[44:47.630 --> 44:55.830]  No. No. Oh, well. I, uh, I was holding one ball and I knocked another into the thing. Great. At the same time. Twofer!
[44:56.310 --> 44:56.970]  Good work, buddy.
[44:57.350 --> 45:03.230]  I think the hardest part of the game is fucking keeping these things in here. Got purple? Good. Orange?
[45:04.390 --> 45:06.930]  There's way too many oranges. Yeah, it's true.
[45:07.810 --> 45:11.630]  Me and Nick are holding on to them, I guess. Lots of purple. I'm not over there. Uh, I am.
[45:12.010 --> 45:15.970]  Oh, oh, me and Geoff. Okay, me and Geoff are holding on to oranges. Come on. Please don't make any more oranges.
[45:17.090 --> 45:20.850]  I know, I know it's nobody's choice. I think this is it. It's really up to God, man.
[45:21.370 --> 45:22.830]  All right, we're locked in. Yeah!
[45:23.430 --> 45:31.470]  Nice! Oh my God, what a way to finish this. Fucking strong. So much quick. Yep. Wow. Look at Nick's little alligator, man. That's great.
[45:31.850 --> 45:33.710]  God, I'm a slack-jawed and stupid.
[45:34.430 --> 45:38.350]  We probably did that in half the time. Oh, absolutely. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think
[45:39.590 --> 45:41.310]  Are you kidding me?
[45:43.210 --> 45:43.750]  Easy.
