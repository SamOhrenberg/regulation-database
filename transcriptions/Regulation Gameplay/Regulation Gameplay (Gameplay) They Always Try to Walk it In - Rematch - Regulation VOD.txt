[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  And Nick can't stop us. Now we've started.
[00:01.980 --> 00:02.940]  We're just gonna go ahead and start.
[00:03.180 --> 00:05.460]  And he has been all day. He's been texting me. He's like,
[00:05.500 --> 00:08.360]  you better not go live. I'm the one who goes live.
[00:08.500 --> 00:09.720]  I'm the one who does it.
[00:11.160 --> 00:12.080]  You know how when Nick is like
[00:12.080 --> 00:13.940]  super negative and it bums everybody out?
[00:14.020 --> 00:15.600]  I've started to call it Nick-ativity.
[00:17.900 --> 00:18.260]  Ohhhhhh.
[00:18.280 --> 00:18.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19.900 --> 00:21.020]  I'm aware of that.
[00:21.840 --> 00:23.360]  You probably get it more than anybody.
[00:24.220 --> 00:26.100]  Yeah. Oh, definitely. It's all day.
[00:26.300 --> 00:28.080]  I'm in a bunch of group chats where I'm like,
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.740]  we're like having fun and hanging out.
[00:29.860 --> 00:31.860]  And Nick's like, you better not be having fun without me.
[00:32.160 --> 00:34.200]  Damn, dude. And then when he turns it the other way
[00:34.200 --> 00:36.120]  and he's being really charming and he gets us
[00:36.120 --> 00:38.060]  all like under and he's like, I'll do anything
[00:38.060 --> 00:39.700]  for you, Nick. Then we're Nick-matized.
[00:40.640 --> 00:42.520]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's true.
[00:43.100 --> 00:44.520]  That's what they call it.
[00:44.600 --> 00:46.080]  I don't like being in more than three group
[00:46.080 --> 00:46.980]  chats at once.
[00:48.540 --> 00:50.160]  I have a three group chat minimum.
[00:50.160 --> 00:52.000]  So what do you do if anyone
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.020]  gets put to you? You just sort of like
[00:54.660 --> 00:55.380]  leave one?
[00:55.380 --> 00:57.160]  Yeah, I'm not available.
[00:57.680 --> 00:59.560]  I get stressed because I feel like
[00:59.560 --> 01:01.440]  I'm at every group chat. I feel
[01:01.440 --> 01:03.340]  like I'm at a party and I can't be in too many
[01:03.340 --> 01:05.200]  parts. I'll get stretched too thin.
[01:06.140 --> 01:07.360]  So I need to
[01:07.360 --> 01:08.720]  prioritize my group chats.
[01:09.140 --> 01:11.440]  Do you have any group chats that aren't
[01:11.440 --> 01:13.480]  supposed to last past an event but somehow
[01:13.480 --> 01:14.180]  still did?
[01:15.460 --> 01:17.320]  The group chat from the cruise
[01:17.320 --> 01:18.400]  I was on is still going.
[01:19.180 --> 01:20.540]  Are you serious? Yeah.
[01:21.220 --> 01:23.500]  It's still called cruise 2024 or whatever.
[01:23.500 --> 01:25.120]  Maybe you're still on the cruise.
[01:25.240 --> 01:27.100]  Maybe you're on that nine month cruise and you just don't know.
[01:27.100 --> 01:28.780]  It's a Jacob's Ladder situation.
[01:29.040 --> 01:30.180]  It's all come full circle.
[01:31.300 --> 01:32.980]  When we went to Rooster Teeth
[01:33.500 --> 01:35.360]  there was a lot of Slack channels
[01:35.360 --> 01:36.780]  that just get left after the event.
[01:36.980 --> 01:39.040]  But I stayed in E3 2016
[01:39.040 --> 01:40.500]  with James Willems for
[01:41.400 --> 01:42.500]  nine more years.
[01:44.380 --> 01:45.500]  See, Slack's the opposite.
[01:46.100 --> 01:47.200]  I didn't know how to leave
[01:47.200 --> 01:49.320]  those things. Not that I didn't know
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.080]  how to, I just never cared to do it
[01:51.080 --> 01:53.040]  or find out. And then one day I was looking at
[01:53.040 --> 01:55.300]  my list and I realized I was the only person
[01:55.300 --> 01:57.220]  in like 18 of those
[01:57.220 --> 01:59.140]  groups. Oh, yeah.
[01:59.500 --> 02:01.060]  For me, it's the reverse
[02:01.060 --> 02:03.200]  for Slack. Put me in every Slack channel.
[02:03.540 --> 02:05.220]  I'm looking like I'm productive
[02:05.220 --> 02:07.140]  as hell. Put me in there.
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.260]  Add me to your Slack channel.
[02:09.660 --> 02:11.100]  Look at how many Slack channels
[02:11.100 --> 02:12.100]  I'm in, Daddy Warner.
[02:13.700 --> 02:14.960]  Simultaneously working in
[02:14.960 --> 02:17.200]  50 Slacks. This is crazy.
[02:17.380 --> 02:18.420]  MVP over here.
[02:18.420 --> 02:20.440]  They truly didn't care how many
[02:20.440 --> 02:22.480]  Slacks that we were in at all. I was
[02:22.480 --> 02:24.610]  in so many Slack channels where it was like
[02:25.620 --> 02:26.700]  some writing
[02:26.700 --> 02:28.520]  ideas or something like that.
[02:28.700 --> 02:29.360]  Oh, that was a great one.
[02:29.920 --> 02:31.980]  Yeah, that was great. And you watch
[02:33.060 --> 02:33.600]  people...
[02:33.600 --> 02:35.820]  You just watch people drop off.
[02:36.120 --> 02:36.940]  It's awesome.
[02:38.720 --> 02:40.580]  Eric knows what's happening
[02:40.580 --> 02:41.420]  in Israel tomorrow.
[02:43.560 --> 02:44.100]  Before
[02:44.740 --> 02:46.560]  I was like helping manage
[02:46.560 --> 02:47.540]  Let's Play stuff,
[02:48.440 --> 02:50.520]  probably two weeks before, I got
[02:50.520 --> 02:52.380]  removed from the AH Post
[02:52.380 --> 02:54.460]  Slack after being there
[02:54.460 --> 02:56.300]  for years. And then I started
[02:56.300 --> 02:58.540]  doing Let's Play stuff, whereas
[02:58.540 --> 03:00.520]  dealing with everyone in post. And I
[03:00.520 --> 03:02.660]  never got brought back to the AH Post
[03:02.660 --> 03:04.640]  Slack channel. I was in
[03:04.640 --> 03:06.680]  there for like six years when I didn't
[03:06.680 --> 03:08.580]  need to be. And then when it would
[03:08.580 --> 03:10.620]  have been useful, I was going... How strange.
[03:10.800 --> 03:12.260]  I got booted by Sarah Weeks.
[03:12.260 --> 03:14.320]  Oh, you got weemed.
[03:14.580 --> 03:15.780]  I got weemed before.
[03:16.320 --> 03:18.300]  You got weemed with extreme prejudice.
[03:18.340 --> 03:18.800]  Yeah, I did.
[03:20.100 --> 03:22.300]  The screen shot from the E3
[03:22.300 --> 03:23.480]  2015 Slack.
[03:24.940 --> 03:26.280]  And every year we
[03:26.280 --> 03:27.660]  would just talk about Evolve.
[03:32.260 --> 03:33.720]  Dr. Drunk Mouse.
[03:34.320 --> 03:36.320]  Yeah, a lot of subs coming in, a lot going
[03:36.320 --> 03:38.060]  on. And...
[03:38.060 --> 03:40.240]  A video game. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.700]  Welcome to our Friday stream.
[03:42.780 --> 03:44.460]  It's Eric, it's Geoff,
[03:44.600 --> 03:46.300]  it's Gavin, and it's Andrew.
[03:46.680 --> 03:48.240]  Nick said, I don't
[03:48.240 --> 03:50.320]  want to be here. I don't want to hang out
[03:50.320 --> 03:52.180]  with these people. And you guys better
[03:52.180 --> 03:54.360]  not stream. And it's like,
[03:54.440 --> 03:56.360]  dude, really? And Geoff said, no.
[03:56.880 --> 03:57.540]  You know what's crazy?
[03:58.180 --> 04:00.300]  With all the protests happening in
[04:00.300 --> 04:02.680]  the world, what are you about to say?
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.700]  Nick has only protested
[04:04.700 --> 04:06.340]  this game because he's a
[04:06.340 --> 04:08.140]  Rocket League guy and he
[04:08.140 --> 04:10.120]  demands his soccer have cars.
[04:10.460 --> 04:12.240]  That's the only act of protest
[04:12.240 --> 04:13.960]  he's currently part of. I asked
[04:13.960 --> 04:16.620]  Nick where he fell on the Israel-Palestine
[04:16.620 --> 04:18.260]  thing and he said, which one made
[04:18.260 --> 04:20.160]  Rocket League? And I was like, I'm honestly
[04:20.160 --> 04:20.620]  not sure.
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.180]  And on that note, he said
[04:24.180 --> 04:26.240]  clutch save is what he said.
[04:26.260 --> 04:27.360]  Oh my god.
[04:27.860 --> 04:29.940]  This stream is bad.
[04:30.380 --> 04:31.480]  No, it's gonna be good.
[04:32.340 --> 04:33.360]  We're gonna have a rematch.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.280]  This is rematch.
[04:35.800 --> 04:36.580]  I tried
[04:37.220 --> 04:39.200]  to make my character look like Caitlin Clark
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.540]  just because I figured like
[04:40.540 --> 04:43.080]  a little sports crossover
[04:43.080 --> 04:45.380]  kind of thing. They didn't really have a good hairstyle
[04:45.380 --> 04:47.320]  but I tried. So, let's jump into
[04:47.320 --> 04:49.220]  a quick match and see what happens. How about that?
[04:49.620 --> 04:51.580]  Look at this. We got 4v4.
[04:52.180 --> 04:52.980]  Oh, there's 4v4?
[04:53.380 --> 04:55.080]  Great. We can only blame each other.
[04:55.420 --> 04:56.380]  That's great. There you go, guys.
[04:57.040 --> 04:59.040]  There's four of us and now we're in matchmaking.
[04:59.120 --> 05:00.520]  Now we sit here in matchmaking.
[05:01.540 --> 05:03.120]  I tried to look like
[05:03.120 --> 05:05.060]  Vin Diesel but with a robot
[05:05.060 --> 05:06.760]  leg and a robot arm.
[05:07.360 --> 05:09.120]  Because whenever a game lets me have robot
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.780]  parts, I put on robot parts.
[05:10.880 --> 05:12.980]  I did not know you could customize a character.
[05:13.400 --> 05:14.000]  I didn't either.
[05:14.720 --> 05:17.380]  And now we're jumping in. It's rematch.
[05:17.580 --> 05:19.440]  Welcome to the game. It's on Game Pass.
[05:19.720 --> 05:21.140]  This is not sponsored. It's just
[05:21.140 --> 05:22.500]  simply what it is.
[05:24.080 --> 05:24.520]  Alright.
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.440]  This is us. We're walking.
[05:27.220 --> 05:29.140]  I feel like I drew all of your custom
[05:29.140 --> 05:31.060]  characters trying to have as few limbs
[05:31.060 --> 05:32.980]  as possible. Yeah, that's what I always
[05:32.980 --> 05:35.240]  go for. If I can remove any limbs, they're gone.
[05:35.500 --> 05:37.120]  Alright, boys. What color are we
[05:37.120 --> 05:38.240]  wearing for you guys?
[05:38.860 --> 05:40.620]  We're white. I'm wearing red.
[05:40.820 --> 05:41.340]  Back to the keeper.
[05:42.720 --> 05:45.060]  Who's in net? Oh, Gavin's in net.
[05:46.280 --> 05:47.240]  I'm in net.
[05:47.240 --> 05:49.080]  Come on, Gavin. You got this. You're the goalie.
[05:49.600 --> 05:50.680]  Is that the phrase?
[05:50.780 --> 05:52.780]  Yeah. Have you never heard that?
[05:53.200 --> 05:53.460]  No.
[05:53.760 --> 05:56.140]  It's like a hockey terminology.
[05:56.480 --> 05:58.900]  Once I remember how to pass.
[05:58.900 --> 06:00.800]  There we go. I think X is maybe?
[06:01.100 --> 06:01.760]  Yeah, it is X.
[06:03.700 --> 06:05.920]  Geoff, Geoff, Geoff.
[06:05.960 --> 06:06.680]  Left bumper sprint.
[06:08.320 --> 06:09.040]  B is
[06:09.040 --> 06:10.360]  slide tackle and shit.
[06:11.220 --> 06:12.780]  X is pass.
[06:13.180 --> 06:14.940]  Uh-oh. And then right trigger is
[06:14.940 --> 06:17.080]  shoot. I think left trigger is run
[06:17.080 --> 06:17.680]  if you have it.
[06:17.840 --> 06:19.380]  Oh, Gavin!
[06:20.120 --> 06:21.580]  You go into defense.
[06:21.940 --> 06:24.980]  Way to go, boys. Yeah, left trigger is defense.
[06:25.640 --> 06:25.940]  There you go.
[06:25.940 --> 06:27.680]  Oh, God.
[06:28.820 --> 06:29.580]  That was a nice pass.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.240]  Oh, shit.
[06:34.040 --> 06:35.640]  Yeah, I was trying to pass. I couldn't get it off.
[06:36.440 --> 06:37.580]  Gavin, here it comes.
[06:38.380 --> 06:39.560]  You're looking across.
[06:39.900 --> 06:41.760]  Got it. Got it. Nice, Eric.
[06:42.340 --> 06:43.300]  What a tackle.
[06:44.020 --> 06:46.160]  Thanks, boys. It's coming home, Gavin.
[06:46.540 --> 06:47.580]  Coming home. Left bumper.
[06:47.840 --> 06:50.100]  Double tap that. There you go. Double tap that left bumper
[06:50.100 --> 06:50.800]  to get that boost.
[06:51.840 --> 06:54.000]  It's way down. Gavin, it's coming back.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.560]  Gavin, it's Gavin. What are you doing?
[06:55.780 --> 06:56.060]  Gavin!
[06:58.060 --> 06:58.880]  Uh-oh. No!
[06:59.740 --> 07:00.980]  Nice, Gavin. There you go.
[07:01.280 --> 07:03.420]  That's how you do it. You hold it.
[07:04.100 --> 07:04.540]  Oops.
[07:05.520 --> 07:06.180]  Oh, my God.
[07:06.320 --> 07:08.960]  Come on, Andrew.
[07:10.080 --> 07:11.060]  Pass it to me, Andrew.
[07:11.500 --> 07:13.560]  I'm trying to get there.
[07:14.880 --> 07:15.740]  It's like football
[07:15.740 --> 07:17.400]  without the boring shit like throw-ins.
[07:18.180 --> 07:19.380]  Oh, my God!
[07:20.460 --> 07:21.240]  Yo, this game is
[07:21.240 --> 07:22.640]  this game is good.
[07:23.140 --> 07:23.720]  This is my game.
[07:25.040 --> 07:25.560]  Wow!
[07:26.820 --> 07:28.080]  This is like fun.
[07:30.260 --> 07:31.340]  I'm trying to cover the cross.
[07:31.640 --> 07:32.440]  Nice, Eric.
[07:34.100 --> 07:34.940]  Nice, nice, nice.
[07:35.440 --> 07:36.040]  Oh, they got me.
[07:37.160 --> 07:38.880]  Can we shoot again?
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.200]  Right trigger.
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.300]  And directions.
[07:43.280 --> 07:43.600]  There you go.
[07:44.520 --> 07:46.460]  Nice, Gavin. Good, good, good.
[07:47.200 --> 07:47.680]  Oh!
[07:49.100 --> 07:49.500]  Uh...
[07:49.500 --> 07:49.820]  Get back!
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.340]  There you go.
[07:53.820 --> 07:54.820]  That looked like handball to me.
[07:56.060 --> 07:57.520]  Yeah, I guess I became goalie
[07:57.520 --> 07:58.560]  for some reason briefly.
[07:58.760 --> 08:00.960]  If you step in the box and no one else is there,
[08:01.060 --> 08:01.840]  you become the goalie.
[08:01.940 --> 08:03.780]  What does he do?
[08:04.040 --> 08:06.440]  It could be anyone. Anyone can be the goalie.
[08:07.160 --> 08:09.440]  So if we want to switch or whatever,
[08:09.740 --> 08:10.860]  it's a doable thing.
[08:11.080 --> 08:11.560]  Nice, Gavin.
[08:13.060 --> 08:14.840]  How do you catch the ball, Gav?
[08:14.840 --> 08:15.300]  What's the button?
[08:16.660 --> 08:18.120]  Oh my god!
[08:18.120 --> 08:18.440]  Gavin!
[08:21.560 --> 08:22.120]  Sorry!
[08:22.560 --> 08:24.440]  Down, down, down!
[08:25.080 --> 08:25.640]  Go!
[08:26.620 --> 08:27.180]  Too far.
[08:27.600 --> 08:30.420]  It's left trigger. You go into a defensive stance.
[08:30.860 --> 08:31.720]  And then do you have to push a button?
[08:32.040 --> 08:33.100]  I can't remember.
[08:33.460 --> 08:33.840]  Why?
[08:37.260 --> 08:38.720]  Just clearing it down.
[08:38.880 --> 08:39.340]  Just dumping it.
[08:39.960 --> 08:41.540]  How's it looking and sounding, everyone?
[08:41.540 --> 08:43.540]  How's chat? How are we doing?
[08:43.840 --> 08:44.860]  I think you sound great.
[08:45.540 --> 08:47.820]  I want to make sure that it's all coming through for them.
[08:49.120 --> 08:49.620]  How do we
[08:49.620 --> 08:51.720]  just take it away again? What button is that?
[08:52.020 --> 08:53.560]  B, B, B.
[08:53.680 --> 08:55.180]  I couldn't...
[08:55.180 --> 08:56.020]  Oh, Gavin!
[08:57.160 --> 08:58.000]  What a save!
[08:59.380 --> 09:01.620]  Fuck, I keep
[09:01.620 --> 09:02.580]  slide tag on.
[09:03.520 --> 09:05.500]  Yeah, just don't hold sprint.
[09:05.760 --> 09:07.000]  Gavin's a real tooth harasser.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.880]  I think the problem is I'm always holding sprint.
[09:08.880 --> 09:10.000]  Let go of it.
[09:10.040 --> 09:11.680]  You gotta let go of it.
[09:11.680 --> 09:14.160]  Oh, shit! Uh-oh!
[09:14.500 --> 09:14.900]  Uh-oh!
[09:16.590 --> 09:17.400]  It's up above.
[09:18.100 --> 09:19.320]  Get it out of there!
[09:19.880 --> 09:21.640]  Go, Andrew!
[09:22.100 --> 09:23.180]  Very good.
[09:24.040 --> 09:25.760]  Excellent direction passes.
[09:26.740 --> 09:27.720]  Dump it up.
[09:28.080 --> 09:28.380]  You're alright.
[09:29.840 --> 09:31.120]  Gavin, throw it to the left.
[09:31.580 --> 09:32.260]  There you go.
[09:34.060 --> 09:35.360]  You're alright.
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.860]  Way to go, Gavin.
[09:37.540 --> 09:38.400]  Spread it out.
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.440]  Here we go, boys.
[09:43.440 --> 09:45.580]  Slide tackle was way off, but at least it got him to move.
[09:46.560 --> 09:47.320]  Good press.
[09:47.460 --> 09:48.400]  We're doing good.
[09:48.520 --> 09:50.700]  You got it, Gavin.
[09:50.820 --> 09:51.800]  You got it.
[09:53.180 --> 09:53.660]  Nice.
[09:55.780 --> 09:56.520]  We're alright.
[09:57.140 --> 09:58.420]  Thank you so much.
[09:59.160 --> 09:59.860]  Almost missed that.
[10:01.660 --> 10:02.360]  Come on.
[10:02.360 --> 10:02.780]  Damn it.
[10:03.320 --> 10:05.680]  Man, this is crazy.
[10:05.940 --> 10:06.420]  Uh-oh.
[10:07.520 --> 10:08.800]  Get in there.
[10:09.000 --> 10:10.800]  You're doing alright.
[10:11.600 --> 10:12.300]  Eric!
[10:14.620 --> 10:14.880]  Gotcha.
[10:16.180 --> 10:17.180]  Damn it.
[10:18.660 --> 10:19.900]  There you go.
[10:20.000 --> 10:20.680]  Stay in the offense.
[10:21.460 --> 10:22.160]  I'm running with you.
[10:22.260 --> 10:23.020]  Kick it left.
[10:24.340 --> 10:26.060]  I'm so open.
[10:28.580 --> 10:29.980]  Damn it!
[10:31.140 --> 10:32.080]  Get off him.
[10:32.080 --> 10:33.200]  We're just trying to fight the keeper.
[10:34.420 --> 10:35.660]  You got it, Gavin. You're alright.
[10:36.320 --> 10:37.280]  Good boot.
[10:37.520 --> 10:39.460]  Andrew, me and you. Cross.
[10:39.820 --> 10:41.300]  How do I...
[10:41.300 --> 10:41.940]  There you go.
[10:43.380 --> 10:44.240]  No, Geoff!
[10:44.500 --> 10:47.480]  It was Geoff!
[10:47.800 --> 10:49.840]  Geoff slide tackled into it.
[10:50.460 --> 10:51.240]  Oh, no.
[10:51.720 --> 10:53.280]  I was so set up.
[10:53.700 --> 10:54.580]  I didn't know you were to my left.
[10:55.040 --> 10:56.020]  There you go.
[10:56.020 --> 10:57.220]  Try to get it this time, Eric.
[10:57.320 --> 10:58.240]  He got me.
[10:59.540 --> 11:00.540]  Took me too long.
[11:03.420 --> 11:04.460]  I'm open in the middle.
[11:04.640 --> 11:04.840]  Right here.
[11:06.860 --> 11:07.300]  No!
[11:08.220 --> 11:08.820]  Damn it.
[11:10.500 --> 11:11.340]  You're alright, Gavin.
[11:11.860 --> 11:12.380]  You're good.
[11:14.160 --> 11:14.880]  Here they come.
[11:15.620 --> 11:16.360]  On the counter.
[11:17.660 --> 11:18.460]  Nice, Gavin.
[11:20.680 --> 11:21.300]  Let's go.
[11:21.440 --> 11:22.300]  Everyone, let's go.
[11:22.300 --> 11:22.960]  No, no, no.
[11:23.360 --> 11:24.500]  Gavin, get back there.
[11:25.820 --> 11:27.260]  13 seconds left.
[11:28.000 --> 11:28.380]  10.
[11:30.060 --> 11:31.000]  Come on, boys.
[11:31.080 --> 11:32.940]  It's been a defensive juggernaut.
[11:34.320 --> 11:36.300]  This game is crazy.
[11:37.000 --> 11:37.380]  Oh, no!
[11:38.480 --> 11:38.700]  No!
[11:39.500 --> 11:40.060]  Overtime!
[11:41.120 --> 11:42.040]  Alright, run it.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.160]  How do you juggle the ball again?
[11:45.220 --> 11:46.360]  I don't remember.
[11:46.760 --> 11:47.160]  No!
[11:47.160 --> 11:48.780]  Oh, no!
[11:49.060 --> 11:50.500]  Someone took goalie for me.
[11:52.300 --> 11:53.440]  I became another goalie,
[11:53.500 --> 11:54.380]  so I couldn't dive anywhere.
[11:54.480 --> 11:55.360]  I was diving with my head.
[11:55.600 --> 11:57.300]  I think you had left and came back.
[11:58.460 --> 12:00.220]  Look at me trying to save it with my head.
[12:01.960 --> 12:03.040]  Way to go, guys.
[12:03.300 --> 12:04.320]  I think there was something like...
[12:04.320 --> 12:05.820]  Do you remember there was a rainbow pass
[12:05.820 --> 12:07.100]  you can pass yourself by hitting?
[12:07.960 --> 12:11.160]  It's right bumper and...
[12:12.080 --> 12:13.040]  A or X?
[12:13.140 --> 12:13.880]  I think it's A.
[12:13.880 --> 12:14.920]  It didn't come home.
[12:15.340 --> 12:17.240]  This is fun.
[12:18.220 --> 12:19.280]  I'm going to start new matchmaking.
[12:19.620 --> 12:20.920]  I'm going to start new matchmaking.
[12:21.040 --> 12:23.020]  Thank you so much for the subs.
[12:23.360 --> 12:25.720]  Thank you, guys. Hopefully, it's looking
[12:25.720 --> 12:26.640]  and sounding good.
[12:28.200 --> 12:28.900]  This is great.
[12:29.740 --> 12:32.140]  Hey, I want to say
[12:32.140 --> 12:34.060]  I appreciate the mods.
[12:34.220 --> 12:35.480]  I appreciate the mods who are here
[12:36.080 --> 12:37.980]  taking care of everything when we're doing this.
[12:38.080 --> 12:39.440]  I also appreciate the mods.
[12:39.520 --> 12:41.600]  I just want the mods to know I appreciate you a little bit more
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.220]  than Eric does.
[12:42.380 --> 12:46.240]  I have a more intense appreciation for you.
[12:46.560 --> 12:47.220]  I don't think so.
[12:48.620 --> 12:49.440]  We're home colors.
[12:49.700 --> 12:50.620]  It is what it is.
[12:50.900 --> 12:52.180]  There you go.
[12:52.660 --> 12:54.720]  I did my Indiana Fever colors.
[12:56.320 --> 12:57.500]  Caitlin Clark taking it to them.
[12:59.920 --> 13:00.920]  This is...
[13:00.920 --> 13:02.400]  I've been waiting for this.
[13:02.760 --> 13:03.740]  I don't want to be goalie.
[13:04.860 --> 13:06.360]  Get out of goal.
[13:07.520 --> 13:09.340]  You do it, Gav. You're the man.
[13:11.120 --> 13:12.060]  Got it to you, Eric.
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.620]  It came right back to me.
[13:14.680 --> 13:15.680]  I didn't think it was going to hit me.
[13:15.880 --> 13:16.240]  There we go.
[13:18.800 --> 13:19.200]  Nice!
[13:21.380 --> 13:22.780]  I thought it was in.
[13:22.860 --> 13:23.760]  That was so cool.
[13:24.100 --> 13:25.000]  What a heartbreaker.
[13:25.160 --> 13:26.620]  I rainbowed it over and everything.
[13:26.900 --> 13:28.060]  Was that right bumper in A?
[13:28.620 --> 13:29.200]  Yeah, it was.
[13:29.980 --> 13:30.400]  Back here.
[13:31.480 --> 13:32.700]  There you go.
[13:37.740 --> 13:38.540]  Come on.
[13:38.540 --> 13:39.700]  It's like...
[13:39.700 --> 13:41.080]  It's fine.
[13:42.050 --> 13:43.520]  This is awesome.
[13:44.460 --> 13:45.860]  Why didn't...
[13:45.860 --> 13:46.180]  Andrew.
[13:48.290 --> 13:49.320]  You're alright.
[13:49.980 --> 13:51.100]  Geoff's right there.
[13:52.040 --> 13:53.280]  Press. Watch it, Gavin.
[13:53.460 --> 13:55.060]  You're doing okay.
[13:58.400 --> 13:59.420]  Nice!
[14:00.100 --> 14:02.460]  Who wants it?
[14:02.560 --> 14:02.720]  Me.
[14:04.250 --> 14:05.000]  I'm covered.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  It's alright.
[14:08.540 --> 14:10.440]  There we go.
[14:10.460 --> 14:11.140]  Got it.
[14:11.660 --> 14:13.260]  Nice. Good play.
[14:13.940 --> 14:15.800]  Right bumper A.
[14:16.920 --> 14:20.180]  There you go!
[14:21.160 --> 14:22.940]  Way to go, boys!
[14:23.160 --> 14:23.540]  Achievement!
[14:24.780 --> 14:26.060]  Right bumper in A.
[14:27.260 --> 14:28.080]  See you!
[14:29.200 --> 14:31.020]  That goal was for T-Centia
[14:31.020 --> 14:32.660]  with 50 gifted subs.
[14:32.660 --> 14:34.160]  Holy shit!
[14:34.600 --> 14:35.420]  Thank you so much!
[14:35.720 --> 14:37.460]  Gavin, you wanna fall back and take this?
[14:37.600 --> 14:38.540]  You got it.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.880]  Can this be the only thing we play for like two weeks?
[14:42.500 --> 14:42.940]  This is great.
[14:44.360 --> 14:45.420]  Here it comes.
[14:45.520 --> 14:47.260]  Let's never let Nick play.
[14:49.160 --> 14:51.120]  Even though there's a 5v5,
[14:51.380 --> 14:52.480]  this is for the boys.
[14:55.200 --> 14:55.940]  It's open!
[14:56.380 --> 14:57.360]  Andrew, you got it!
[14:58.180 --> 14:58.700]  Andrew!
[14:58.700 --> 14:58.940]  Andrew!
[15:00.660 --> 15:02.660]  There was no goalie.
[15:03.340 --> 15:04.360]  There, you got it.
[15:05.720 --> 15:06.600]  There we go.
[15:06.820 --> 15:07.420]  There you go!
[15:09.140 --> 15:11.180]  Is somebody playing for MVP?
[15:15.680 --> 15:16.680]  Second goal properly
[15:16.680 --> 15:19.240]  of GDuff91 with 10 gifted subs.
[15:19.360 --> 15:20.520]  Thank you, GDuff!
[15:20.860 --> 15:21.600]  It was for you!
[15:23.620 --> 15:24.240]  I'm in that.
[15:25.560 --> 15:27.220]  Gavin, you're welcome to tag it if you want.
[15:27.220 --> 15:28.000]  I think you should switch.
[15:28.140 --> 15:29.820]  I think you gotta play up.
[15:31.600 --> 15:32.580]  You got two...
[15:32.580 --> 15:33.080]  Oh, here we go.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.260]  Oh, that got tackled from fucking behind.
[15:38.180 --> 15:39.060]  We're alright, we're alright.
[15:41.220 --> 15:42.020]  Oh, watch it.
[15:42.960 --> 15:44.160]  Oh, Andrew.
[15:45.440 --> 15:46.400]  Oh, you know what we should do?
[15:46.560 --> 15:48.440]  I should play goalie on their side.
[15:48.580 --> 15:50.420]  Then they'll think they're covered, but I'll let it go through.
[15:52.520 --> 15:52.900]  Nice.
[15:53.160 --> 15:53.740]  Take that.
[15:53.980 --> 15:55.700]  Oh, no!
[15:55.780 --> 15:56.780]  You gotta get the ball!
[16:00.440 --> 16:01.460]  Oh, I got tackled.
[16:01.560 --> 16:03.560]  I was trying to pass it back to Gavin.
[16:04.140 --> 16:04.580]  No, no, it's alright.
[16:05.180 --> 16:06.700]  Jugs McTugs with the gifted subs.
[16:07.040 --> 16:08.040]  Thank you, Jugs!
[16:09.300 --> 16:11.740]  Oh, damn it.
[16:12.920 --> 16:14.180]  Missing my slide tackles.
[16:14.800 --> 16:15.300]  You're alright, yeah.
[16:15.640 --> 16:17.200]  You're alright. We're doing good.
[16:17.200 --> 16:18.320]  Press, press.
[16:19.360 --> 16:20.480]  Got it! Nice block.
[16:20.700 --> 16:21.360]  Very nice.
[16:22.140 --> 16:24.280]  Oh, look at that.
[16:25.080 --> 16:25.280]  Ah!
[16:26.520 --> 16:28.620]  I was just off target.
[16:29.860 --> 16:30.440]  Alright.
[16:31.700 --> 16:32.380]  Oh, nice!
[16:32.460 --> 16:34.880]  You got it, you got it, you got it.
[16:38.020 --> 16:38.600]  Oh!
[16:39.560 --> 16:40.980]  God, I tried to play it off the bounce.
[16:41.320 --> 16:42.840]  It's coming for you, Andrew.
[16:43.920 --> 16:45.600]  What a stop!
[16:46.040 --> 16:46.460]  Unbelievable.
[16:46.460 --> 16:48.300]  Spread out, spread out. There you go.
[16:49.240 --> 16:50.000]  Alright, Gavin, get it!
[16:52.040 --> 16:52.160]  Oh!
[16:54.820 --> 16:56.180]  Same goal, same goal, same goal.
[16:56.360 --> 16:57.040]  You're alright, you're alright.
[16:59.240 --> 17:00.680]  Nice forward. There you go.
[17:01.200 --> 17:01.800]  Watch the ball.
[17:02.280 --> 17:02.820]  Watch the cross.
[17:05.420 --> 17:05.780]  Damn.
[17:07.840 --> 17:08.280]  Got it.
[17:08.500 --> 17:09.100]  Going right.
[17:09.260 --> 17:11.000]  I'm way off sides. Give it to me.
[17:11.840 --> 17:12.200]  Hahaha.
[17:12.200 --> 17:12.380]  Hahaha.
[17:16.220 --> 17:18.160]  Eric, I'm open! I'm open, son!
[17:18.740 --> 17:19.420]  So am I!
[17:19.780 --> 17:22.160]  Come on! Oh, I thought that was it.
[17:22.180 --> 17:23.700]  I'm sorry. I thought I really had it.
[17:24.020 --> 17:24.400]  Goddamn.
[17:27.840 --> 17:30.180]  That's you, that's you. That's easy, that's easy, that's easy.
[17:31.000 --> 17:31.580]  There you go.
[17:36.440 --> 17:37.840]  It's coming back, it's coming back.
[17:39.320 --> 17:40.080]  No cross.
[17:41.440 --> 17:41.720]  Oh!
[17:41.720 --> 17:42.300]  Shit, sorry.
[17:42.880 --> 17:43.320]  That's alright.
[17:44.940 --> 17:46.020]  That's a pretty stadium.
[17:46.920 --> 17:48.360]  I wonder what city we're in right now.
[17:48.740 --> 17:50.180]  This game is really cool.
[17:51.400 --> 17:53.660]  Dinkleberg said this is a fun game, but I suck at it.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.660]  Like, this is like Rocket League
[17:55.660 --> 17:57.440]  where no one's good at it. Don't worry about it.
[17:57.620 --> 17:59.880]  And if you are good at it, that probably means something bad about you.
[17:59.980 --> 18:00.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[18:01.840 --> 18:03.300]  Alright, boys. Let's press.
[18:03.500 --> 18:05.140]  Back where things belong. There you go.
[18:05.680 --> 18:07.640]  Ooh, Gavin. Gavin's running it out.
[18:07.800 --> 18:09.380]  Alright, alright, I'll play goal.
[18:09.940 --> 18:10.860]  Gavin, you want in?
[18:10.960 --> 18:11.400]  Oh, please.
[18:11.820 --> 18:13.380]  Take it.
[18:14.520 --> 18:16.980]  Oh, there you go. There you go, Andrew. Come on.
[18:17.320 --> 18:17.820]  There you go.
[18:18.860 --> 18:21.160]  Wow. That was a really good save.
[18:21.980 --> 18:22.140]  Yep.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.080]  Ooh, he got me.
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.880]  Braxterman gifted subs.
[18:27.940 --> 18:28.880]  50 gifted subs.
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.340]  Oh my god, thank you.
[18:30.460 --> 18:34.060]  Wow. Do you say Tony Braxton gave us 50 gifted subs?
[18:34.720 --> 18:35.560]  Unbreak my heart.
[18:36.920 --> 18:37.760]  Thank you, Tony.
[18:40.660 --> 18:40.980]  Okay.
[18:41.740 --> 18:42.380]  Come on.
[18:43.780 --> 18:44.520]  Where's he playing?
[18:45.940 --> 18:46.260]  Damn.
[18:47.700 --> 18:49.160]  Oh, I thought it was coming all the way.
[18:49.240 --> 18:50.420]  I thought it was coming all the way through.
[18:51.180 --> 18:52.700]  Oof. Uh oh.
[18:52.980 --> 18:53.780]  Pass, pass, pass, pass.
[18:55.420 --> 18:56.680]  Get it out, get it out, get it out.
[18:57.120 --> 18:57.620]  There you go.
[18:58.120 --> 18:58.440]  Ooh.
[19:00.740 --> 19:01.880]  There you go, Andrew. You got it.
[19:03.020 --> 19:03.780]  It's looking nice.
[19:05.160 --> 19:05.600]  There you go.
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.640]  Oh, come on.
[19:07.780 --> 19:08.960]  He pre-dived. That was great.
[19:09.680 --> 19:11.500]  Ah, I could've... damn it.
[19:12.240 --> 19:12.880]  Oh, shitbags.
[19:13.040 --> 19:14.740]  Nice challenge.
[19:15.700 --> 19:16.120]  Move up.
[19:17.580 --> 19:18.700]  Oh god, he got me.
[19:21.160 --> 19:21.680]  Got it.
[19:22.100 --> 19:22.500]  Nice.
[19:22.840 --> 19:24.100]  Me, me, me, me, me, me.
[19:24.640 --> 19:25.900]  Me, me, me, me, me, me.
[19:27.060 --> 19:27.640]  God damn it.
[19:28.760 --> 19:28.860]  Oh.
[19:30.600 --> 19:32.640]  Oh, where'd it go? I lost it.
[19:32.640 --> 19:33.100]  Fuck.
[19:33.260 --> 19:34.600]  Got it.
[19:35.780 --> 19:39.140]  Andrew, no one's on you. Go, go, go.
[19:39.180 --> 19:39.460]  Press.
[19:40.660 --> 19:43.360]  Sometimes you just lose it when you go for the boost.
[19:43.540 --> 19:43.660]  Yeah.
[19:44.100 --> 19:44.980]  Gavin, you got it.
[19:47.420 --> 19:47.880]  Andrew.
[19:48.300 --> 19:48.840]  Cheeky pass.
[19:52.160 --> 19:52.780]  Ah, sorry, Geoff.
[19:56.440 --> 19:57.080]  That's it.
[19:58.760 --> 19:59.660]  Damn it.
[19:59.660 --> 20:00.700]  That's all right.
[20:00.700 --> 20:02.740]  We got the wins.
[20:02.940 --> 20:04.060]  There you go.
[20:04.620 --> 20:07.660]  Branderson as well. Way to go, boys.
[20:07.960 --> 20:09.060]  Branderson with the 10.
[20:10.360 --> 20:11.400]  Thank you so much.
[20:11.400 --> 20:11.440]  Way to go.
[20:12.820 --> 20:15.120]  Kaitlyn Clark and the gang moving on up.
[20:15.200 --> 20:16.400]  Way to go, boys.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.500]  Look how many subs we get when we score and win in that.
[20:21.620 --> 20:24.120]  We're at level 16 on a hype train.
[20:24.260 --> 20:24.620]  Holy shit.
[20:24.620 --> 20:25.360]  This is awesome.
[20:25.360 --> 20:27.280]  Look at Andrew.
[20:27.560 --> 20:28.740]  MVP stylist.
[20:29.620 --> 20:30.300]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[20:30.500 --> 20:31.380]  Way to go, Andrew.
[20:31.740 --> 20:35.300]  I think we're all going to get so much better at this game from this video.
[20:35.420 --> 20:36.640]  I'm really excited to see.
[20:36.820 --> 20:38.000]  This is really fun.
[20:38.620 --> 20:39.700]  Nick won't get any better.
[20:39.800 --> 20:41.620]  He doesn't want to do it.
[20:41.780 --> 20:44.940]  It feels like one of those games
[20:44.940 --> 20:46.520]  where being a medic is really fun.
[20:47.760 --> 20:48.000]  Sure.
[20:48.180 --> 20:48.560]  Yeah.
[20:50.620 --> 20:51.800]  All right, here we go.
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.260]  We're in the whites.
[20:53.560 --> 20:54.900]  All right, I'm going to be the goalie. That's bad.
[20:55.880 --> 20:56.360]  Do you want to swap?
[20:57.020 --> 20:57.780]  No, I'm going to learn.
[20:58.900 --> 20:59.960]  I'm just saying we might lose.
[21:01.040 --> 21:02.120]  So just defensive position.
[21:02.240 --> 21:02.940]  Just left trigger.
[21:06.800 --> 21:08.020]  That's what I'm talking about.
[21:08.180 --> 21:08.880]  That's how you do it.
[21:10.400 --> 21:11.720]  That's how you do it, boys.
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.220]  Look at this replay.
[21:15.080 --> 21:15.400]  Okay.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.860]  They don't even have shoes on.
[21:19.540 --> 21:19.780]  Yep.
[21:22.660 --> 21:23.880]  Are they doing some silly
[21:23.880 --> 21:24.560]  bollocks here?
[21:24.660 --> 21:27.120]  No, I think one guy just isn't playing.
[21:27.200 --> 21:27.940]  Are they the bollocks boys?
[21:28.060 --> 21:31.500]  One guy might be AFK.
[21:32.860 --> 21:33.760]  You guys got it.
[21:34.260 --> 21:35.120]  Oh, Gavin, come on.
[21:35.400 --> 21:37.780]  Go left side to Geoff.
[21:37.860 --> 21:38.760]  I got no goalie.
[21:41.160 --> 21:41.520]  There you go.
[21:43.860 --> 21:44.580]  Right stick
[21:45.100 --> 21:45.460]  is
[21:47.040 --> 21:47.960]  to call for the ball.
[21:48.480 --> 21:49.340]  Oh, you got rainbowed.
[21:50.420 --> 21:51.240]  There you go.
[21:51.280 --> 21:52.000]  That's how you call for it.
[21:52.460 --> 21:53.400]  Oh, there you go, boys.
[21:56.580 --> 21:57.420]  Get it out.
[21:57.480 --> 21:57.880]  Get it out.
[21:59.240 --> 22:00.880]  Too stressful. Gavin, you got it.
[22:01.800 --> 22:02.280]  There you go.
[22:10.420 --> 22:11.460]  You got it, Geoff.
[22:11.640 --> 22:12.620]  Clear it, Geoff.
[22:13.820 --> 22:14.160]  X.
[22:15.560 --> 22:16.260]  There you go.
[22:17.100 --> 22:17.900]  Oh, Gavin.
[22:18.140 --> 22:18.740]  There you go, Gavin.
[22:19.720 --> 22:20.520]  Hit Andrew.
[22:22.900 --> 22:24.540]  The anticipation of where the ball
[22:24.540 --> 22:26.320]  is going is so important and it's
[22:26.320 --> 22:27.740]  so hard. Yeah, it really is.
[22:28.520 --> 22:30.000]  Oh, they have four people playing now.
[22:30.180 --> 22:31.800]  It's kind of like real soccer, probably.
[22:32.580 --> 22:33.780]  Probably. In that regard.
[22:34.220 --> 22:35.940]  You know what I mean? Gavin.
[22:37.380 --> 22:37.980]  How do you
[22:37.980 --> 22:39.220]  get to it quicker?
[22:40.880 --> 22:42.300]  Left bumper. You hold left
[22:42.300 --> 22:44.120]  bumper to sprint, but if you double tap it, you get
[22:44.120 --> 22:45.420]  like a speed boost.
[22:45.940 --> 22:46.700]  Yeah, like a bit of effort.
[22:47.560 --> 22:49.940]  That's exactly what it's called. A bit of effort.
[22:50.120 --> 22:50.220]  Yeah.
[22:51.780 --> 22:53.000]  They're way back here, boys.
[22:53.960 --> 22:54.800]  Nice, Eric.
[22:59.130 --> 23:00.570]  There you go.
[23:01.170 --> 23:03.770]  No, no, no.
[23:04.650 --> 23:05.150]  Geoff.
[23:07.670 --> 23:09.330]  Where we at, boys?
[23:10.630 --> 23:11.750]  Far right.
[23:11.870 --> 23:12.110]  Far right.
[23:12.110 --> 23:12.530]  Far right.
[23:13.890 --> 23:15.550]  Damn, Matt.
[23:16.170 --> 23:17.070]  You're alright.
[23:18.070 --> 23:19.110]  Going back for support.
[23:23.960 --> 23:24.980]  Terrible shot.
[23:25.420 --> 23:26.360]  Oh my god.
[23:27.500 --> 23:28.620]  Nice save.
[23:29.080 --> 23:29.820]  Geoff, way down.
[23:30.240 --> 23:32.100]  Geoff, it's yours.
[23:34.640 --> 23:35.220]  Oh, fuck.
[23:39.480 --> 23:41.260]  Straight across the goal.
[23:42.440 --> 23:43.080]  Andrew's son.
[23:47.120 --> 23:47.480]  Oh!
[23:48.900 --> 23:49.260]  Gavin!
[23:49.800 --> 23:52.260]  Wish I remembered how to like chip it up for headers.
[23:54.340 --> 23:55.000]  Chip it up for headers.
[23:56.980 --> 23:57.560]  Relaunch that.
[23:57.800 --> 23:59.000]  There you go. You got it.
[23:59.120 --> 24:02.280]  Yeah, now that I actually want to play this, I need to learn what I was pressing
[24:02.280 --> 24:03.360]  buttons through in the tutorial.
[24:04.280 --> 24:06.420]  It's one of those phone in the tutorial, regret it later.
[24:06.580 --> 24:07.600]  Oh, what a shot.
[24:07.880 --> 24:09.160]  Just hit me from that far side.
[24:10.400 --> 24:11.120]  Great try.
[24:11.400 --> 24:12.660]  Yeah, that was great.
[24:12.660 --> 24:15.040]  It looked like you dived the right time, though.
[24:15.220 --> 24:15.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:16.020 --> 24:18.580]  I think it was just the distance was too much to cover.
[24:18.960 --> 24:20.080]  I was in that...
[24:20.080 --> 24:23.300]  So in that situation, you physically hit Y to jump there.
[24:23.520 --> 24:24.540]  Yes, yeah, correct.
[24:26.440 --> 24:26.880]  Santa1563.
[24:27.280 --> 24:28.400]  Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[24:28.680 --> 24:28.940]  Andrew!
[24:29.920 --> 24:30.580]  There you go.
[24:32.820 --> 24:34.420]  Oh, come on!
[24:34.600 --> 24:36.080]  I had that. It was in.
[24:40.750 --> 24:41.710]  You're alright, you're alright.
[24:41.710 --> 24:42.870]  There you go, Andrew.
[24:44.230 --> 24:45.710]  Effort, effort, effort.
[24:47.670 --> 24:48.350]  I just had to clear it.
[24:48.790 --> 24:51.010]  Oh, that's great.
[24:51.370 --> 24:52.030]  Hell yeah!
[24:53.350 --> 24:54.530]  That's how you get it done!
[24:55.070 --> 24:57.870]  Way to go, boys!
[24:58.450 --> 24:59.830]  You're so old!
[25:00.870 --> 25:01.990]  Yeah, I'm the coach.
[25:03.510 --> 25:05.230]  God, I felt so good about that.
[25:05.350 --> 25:07.970]  That felt like fucking football.
[25:08.530 --> 25:08.810]  Yeah.
[25:08.810 --> 25:10.810]  Bit of footy.
[25:14.850 --> 25:16.230]  Foresight, foresight, foresight.
[25:16.550 --> 25:17.050]  Going back.
[25:21.030 --> 25:21.650]  Nice!
[25:22.390 --> 25:23.650]  Press, press, press. Up!
[25:26.650 --> 25:27.610]  There we go.
[25:27.970 --> 25:28.610]  Cleared it midfield.
[25:31.070 --> 25:33.670]  It's alright, it's alright.
[25:38.310 --> 25:39.000]  I'm coming, Gavin.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.660]  Yep, we're back.
[25:41.720 --> 25:42.860]  That's alright, that's alright.
[25:43.080 --> 25:44.380]  That was a hell of a goal.
[25:45.060 --> 25:47.200]  Hey, played a...
[25:47.200 --> 25:48.460]  That was a great play.
[25:48.740 --> 25:51.040]  That was a great play by the very British-looking guy.
[25:51.520 --> 25:51.720]  Damn.
[25:53.100 --> 25:54.800]  I mean, off that wall for a pass.
[25:54.900 --> 25:56.820]  That was huge, that was huge.
[25:58.340 --> 25:59.480]  It's a close game.
[26:00.380 --> 26:00.880]  It is.
[26:01.800 --> 26:03.700]  Geoff, you feeling good about goal or what?
[26:05.420 --> 26:06.260]  Not particularly.
[26:07.300 --> 26:08.140]  Oh my gosh.
[26:08.580 --> 26:10.200]  Do you want someone else to take it over or are you good?
[26:10.820 --> 26:12.300]  Let me learn it, you know?
[26:12.500 --> 26:13.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[26:16.940 --> 26:18.040]  Andrew, if you can hit me far side.
[26:21.040 --> 26:21.400]  Oh!
[26:22.500 --> 26:23.800]  It's okay, it's okay, it wasn't you.
[26:25.400 --> 26:26.080]  Oh, damn it.
[26:30.060 --> 26:30.680]  Come on.
[26:31.280 --> 26:32.780]  Hey, there you go, Geoff!
[26:33.620 --> 26:33.980]  Okay.
[26:35.300 --> 26:36.140]  It's alright, it's alright.
[26:37.520 --> 26:37.920]  Oof.
[26:38.340 --> 26:39.260]  Oh, they're chipping it.
[26:39.640 --> 26:40.700]  That was close.
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.860]  I'm going after, I'm going after.
[26:45.100 --> 26:45.200]  Yeah.
[26:45.820 --> 26:47.200]  Oh god, he got it right over me.
[26:47.320 --> 26:48.400]  There you go!
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.180]  Cleared it, cleared it.
[26:51.200 --> 26:52.160]  Good clear, good clear.
[26:57.840 --> 26:58.640]  Oh, wow!
[26:58.760 --> 27:01.200]  Oh my god, Geoff, what a play.
[27:02.340 --> 27:03.000]  Oh, fuck.
[27:03.740 --> 27:04.580]  No, you're alright, you're alright.
[27:05.520 --> 27:06.760]  If you right trigger
[27:06.760 --> 27:07.860]  his goalie, you can do it.
[27:09.680 --> 27:11.080]  Oh, good play, good play.
[27:11.220 --> 27:11.880]  Oh, what a save.
[27:12.520 --> 27:13.540]  Way down there, there you go.
[27:16.060 --> 27:16.440]  Gavin.
[27:17.420 --> 27:17.800]  Oh!
[27:22.340 --> 27:23.880]  You're alright, watch him, watch him on the bounce.
[27:24.400 --> 27:25.680]  Oh, what a save.
[27:26.560 --> 27:28.000]  That's gonna be our match of the day.
[27:28.480 --> 27:29.280]  That was beautiful.
[27:29.280 --> 27:29.720]  Woo!
[27:32.460 --> 27:33.620]  Fuck, they're
[27:33.620 --> 27:35.020]  sending it down.
[27:37.740 --> 27:38.300]  Oh!
[27:39.360 --> 27:40.500]  Oh, shit!
[27:41.300 --> 27:41.860]  That was tough.
[27:43.840 --> 27:44.400]  Damn.
[27:46.620 --> 27:47.860]  It's this guy again.
[27:48.200 --> 27:49.300]  It's the one guy, yeah.
[27:49.580 --> 27:49.760]  Yeah.
[27:52.500 --> 27:53.920]  Oh, that was pretty cool.
[27:54.040 --> 27:55.460]  How did he do a bicycle kick?
[27:55.900 --> 27:56.220]  Good god.
[27:56.220 --> 27:57.620]  Alright, I'm back in goal, I'm back in goal.
[27:59.580 --> 27:59.980]  Andrew.
[28:00.800 --> 28:01.140]  Thank you.
[28:03.780 --> 28:04.180]  Gavin's
[28:04.180 --> 28:06.000]  open on the other side. Gavin's open
[28:06.000 --> 28:06.780]  far side.
[28:07.960 --> 28:10.340]  There you go, Gavin. Gavin, you got this. Gavin, you got it.
[28:10.800 --> 28:10.920]  Oh!
[28:12.140 --> 28:13.580]  Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker.
[28:16.960 --> 28:18.280]  Good side tackle, almost.
[28:18.600 --> 28:19.000]  Rainbowed.
[28:19.780 --> 28:21.440]  Oh, that was such a bad...
[28:21.980 --> 28:23.660]  That's all 100%
[28:23.660 --> 28:25.160]  100% on me.
[28:25.220 --> 28:26.660]  100% on me.
[28:27.640 --> 28:28.700]  That was terrible.
[28:29.220 --> 28:31.440]  What a bad... I'm hitting
[28:31.440 --> 28:33.180]  skip on the replay so hard.
[28:33.520 --> 28:35.460]  Oh, brutal. Brutal.
[28:36.240 --> 28:36.880]  Brutal.
[28:37.260 --> 28:37.900]  Absolutely
[28:40.200 --> 28:41.220]  abysmal play.
[28:41.340 --> 28:42.800]  Just an abysmal play.
[28:43.500 --> 28:44.740]  I think their third game?
[28:45.520 --> 28:47.520]  They might have been the first people to ever make soccer
[28:47.520 --> 28:47.900]  fun.
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.960]  Why isn't FIFA this?
[28:51.600 --> 28:53.020]  I think they tried with
[28:53.020 --> 28:55.000]  FIFA Street, but this is so much
[28:55.000 --> 28:55.260]  better.
[28:56.680 --> 28:58.780]  Still searching for a first victory. That's okay though.
[28:59.440 --> 29:00.080]  We're getting there.
[29:00.960 --> 29:01.940]  We're figuring it out.
[29:02.780 --> 29:04.920]  We still, I feel like collectively
[29:04.920 --> 29:06.220]  don't know the base controls.
[29:06.920 --> 29:07.880]  We're figuring it out.
[29:11.400 --> 29:12.280]  This is...
[29:12.900 --> 29:13.520]  This is great.
[29:15.500 --> 29:16.920]  I'm looking at the battle pass
[29:16.920 --> 29:17.580]  now for this thing.
[29:17.580 --> 29:18.340]  Let's see what we got.
[29:20.120 --> 29:20.920]  Battle pass!
[29:21.340 --> 29:23.000]  I'm looking at the battle pass!
[29:23.280 --> 29:25.420]  I'm looking for a deagle
[29:25.420 --> 29:26.080]  and a scar.
[29:28.120 --> 29:29.580]  I'm level two now.
[29:29.680 --> 29:31.380]  Is there stuff you unlock or what?
[29:31.460 --> 29:32.020]  I don't know.
[29:33.360 --> 29:35.500]  I think so. Maybe customizable
[29:35.500 --> 29:37.200]  stuff? I don't know.
[29:39.680 --> 29:41.600]  Huh. Well, the store has a bunch of stuff.
[29:41.860 --> 29:43.080]  Crazy. Okay.
[29:43.460 --> 29:45.540]  I'll just go back into quick play. We'll just get right into it.
[29:45.540 --> 29:46.800]  4-4. Let's do it boys.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.980]  I just didn't want a rematch against those guys.
[29:49.140 --> 29:50.080]  Well, that one guy.
[29:54.380 --> 29:56.980]  This is the Sifu devs and people call this game
[29:56.980 --> 29:58.140]  Fifu. That's awesome.
[29:58.720 --> 30:00.100]  That's who made this.
[30:00.600 --> 30:01.360]  That's awesome.
[30:04.360 --> 30:05.920]  I'm really impressed with this game.
[30:06.120 --> 30:09.220]  I did not think I was going to like it this much.
[30:11.240 --> 30:12.540]  I know the beta
[30:12.540 --> 30:14.860]  that they released a few months ago, people loved.
[30:14.860 --> 30:17.280]  So I've been waiting for this to come to console.
[30:22.240 --> 30:23.340]  That's a good text, Gavin.
[30:26.640 --> 30:27.780]  I don't like that.
[30:28.720 --> 30:29.440]  There we go.
[30:30.480 --> 30:32.240]  Alright boys. Indiana Fever, let's go.
[30:35.420 --> 30:36.820]  We got some actual people
[30:36.820 --> 30:38.760]  I think on this other side. Let's see how this goes.
[30:39.160 --> 30:39.300]  Yep.
[30:40.160 --> 30:41.840]  I hope they're ready for us.
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.880]  I think they might be.
[30:46.240 --> 30:47.560]  Guys just holding it in the goal, huh?
[30:47.600 --> 30:48.780]  There we go. Okay, coming down.
[31:01.540 --> 31:02.660]  Can we go back to
[31:02.660 --> 31:03.900]  playing people that are AFK?
[31:06.700 --> 31:09.100]  I'm so worried that it was my fault to check my phone
[31:09.100 --> 31:10.660]  if I was in the Gavin text
[31:10.660 --> 31:12.860]  to reduce my paranoia and I am not.
[31:18.170 --> 31:19.050]  Yeah? Okay.
[31:19.230 --> 31:19.450]  Gavin.
[31:23.950 --> 31:24.830]  Oh, Gavin.
[31:26.170 --> 31:26.790]  Oh, spit.
[31:27.170 --> 31:28.710]  Passed to no one. Brutal.
[31:29.950 --> 31:31.150]  That was a good dodge by you though.
[31:31.230 --> 31:32.150]  You declinked two of them.
[31:35.830 --> 31:37.170]  I'm trying really hard
[31:37.170 --> 31:39.050]  to not make this like child soccer
[31:39.050 --> 31:40.890]  where we're all just chasing the ball
[31:40.890 --> 31:41.770]  and on top of each other.
[31:41.950 --> 31:44.470]  I'm trying to be so mindful of spacing.
[31:46.250 --> 31:47.390]  Come on, come on, come on.
[31:47.410 --> 31:48.150]  Get there, get there, Andrew.
[31:48.910 --> 31:49.790]  It's alright, it's alright.
[31:51.170 --> 31:52.410]  Oh, what a play.
[31:52.670 --> 31:54.770]  Andrew, you got it. Andrew, take the shot. Andrew, take it.
[31:55.110 --> 31:56.930]  There you go. Oh, that dive.
[31:57.710 --> 31:58.070]  Damn.
[31:58.630 --> 32:00.450]  It's alright. He's way down here.
[32:00.630 --> 32:02.270]  Oh, shit. Uh-oh.
[32:02.990 --> 32:03.790]  Oh, he curved.
[32:04.070 --> 32:06.550]  Did you just... Oh, hey. Watch that replay.
[32:08.570 --> 32:10.050]  I didn't know you could curve the ball.
[32:10.130 --> 32:12.290]  How do you curve the ball? I'm not sure how you curve it,
[32:12.290 --> 32:14.190]  but there is a way. Watch, watch.
[32:14.250 --> 32:14.830]  Watch this replay.
[32:17.230 --> 32:18.310]  Oh, that's sneaky.
[32:18.830 --> 32:19.950]  I got juked
[32:19.950 --> 32:22.070]  big style. That was rough.
[32:23.230 --> 32:24.330]  You had to put your shoes back on
[32:24.330 --> 32:24.770]  after that.
[32:26.430 --> 32:27.090]  There you go.
[32:27.970 --> 32:29.750]  Maybe if you have like racing cars,
[32:29.870 --> 32:30.450]  steering wheel, and pedals.
[32:31.890 --> 32:33.490]  Oh, man. I hit...
[32:33.490 --> 32:36.070]  It was free and clear, too. I just started pressing
[32:36.070 --> 32:36.710]  all the other buttons.
[32:37.430 --> 32:39.210]  I was too goalie brained.
[32:40.970 --> 32:41.590]  I started
[32:41.590 --> 32:43.130]  holding L. It was bad.
[32:44.310 --> 32:45.110]  Oh, no. Cross.
[32:45.290 --> 32:46.470]  Got it. There you go.
[32:47.330 --> 32:49.250]  Holy shit. There you go, Eric.
[32:49.310 --> 32:51.150]  Take it. Take it all the way. Deacon
[32:51.150 --> 32:53.030]  Juke. Nutmeg him.
[32:54.190 --> 32:54.770]  Oh, damn it.
[32:55.530 --> 32:56.030]  Good try.
[32:56.730 --> 32:59.270]  I want to know how you fucking spin the ball around
[32:59.270 --> 33:00.530]  and shit. That was crazy.
[33:00.750 --> 33:01.710]  Right behind you.
[33:04.550 --> 33:05.750]  These street rules, baby.
[33:06.730 --> 33:07.250]  Alright, Andrew.
[33:07.250 --> 33:08.850]  Andrew, all you. You're doing good.
[33:10.450 --> 33:11.510]  There you go.
[33:11.630 --> 33:12.450]  Watch the cross.
[33:15.430 --> 33:16.030]  It's alright.
[33:19.150 --> 33:20.210]  Try to get in front of it.
[33:21.610 --> 33:22.230]  You're alright.
[33:23.490 --> 33:24.370]  You're alright.
[33:25.550 --> 33:26.270]  Take your time.
[33:26.990 --> 33:27.990]  Take your time. I'm coming.
[33:28.570 --> 33:29.170]  So bad.
[33:29.310 --> 33:29.790]  So bad.
[33:32.770 --> 33:33.650]  We got this, guys.
[33:33.650 --> 33:35.250]  After you hit your shot,
[33:36.410 --> 33:37.090]  hold a direction with the left stick
[33:37.090 --> 33:38.430]  and it will curve that direction.
[33:38.590 --> 33:41.270]  After you hit your shot, hold a direction
[33:41.270 --> 33:43.790]  with the left stick and it will curve that direction.
[33:44.190 --> 33:44.390]  Wow.
[33:44.810 --> 33:47.850]  Oh, I think we're one point away from getting mercy ruled.
[33:48.410 --> 33:49.610]  Don't worry. I'm a
[33:50.330 --> 33:51.070]  goalie now.
[33:51.190 --> 33:52.010]  We'll be fine.
[33:54.030 --> 33:54.850]  Oh, God.
[33:55.210 --> 33:57.310]  Getting just murdered by these people.
[33:58.210 --> 33:59.670]  Well, it's one of them is a little...
[33:59.670 --> 34:00.530]  Wow, dude.
[34:00.530 --> 34:02.330]  I don't even know what to say.
[34:05.350 --> 34:06.730]  He juked me by not
[34:06.730 --> 34:07.550]  juking me.
[34:10.170 --> 34:10.770]  Look at this.
[34:11.010 --> 34:12.270]  Did the game get harder when we leveled up?
[34:12.410 --> 34:13.130]  Yeah, look at that.
[34:14.550 --> 34:16.770]  Yeah, we're playing other level twos.
[34:17.670 --> 34:18.610]  Yeah, it was like level
[34:18.610 --> 34:20.550]  one, level one, level two, level four.
[34:20.670 --> 34:22.390]  That level four really made a difference.
[34:22.610 --> 34:23.150]  You learned that spin.
[34:23.850 --> 34:26.690]  I'm pretty sure everyone in chat had their eyes closed for that whole game.
[34:26.950 --> 34:27.310]  Yeah.
[34:27.310 --> 34:27.690]  Yeah.
[34:29.670 --> 34:31.150]  I don't think that one counted.
[34:31.330 --> 34:32.530]  As far as I know, that one didn't count.
[34:32.690 --> 34:34.590]  I got 500 points. Close your eyes also.
[34:35.310 --> 34:37.170]  Everyone in chat, you can open your eyes now for the next game.
[34:38.170 --> 34:38.850]  Well, let's
[34:38.850 --> 34:41.210]  wait until all the scores are gone here because I got
[34:41.210 --> 34:42.890]  500 points. Oh, you can open your eyes now.
[34:43.170 --> 34:43.850]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:45.590 --> 34:47.070]  God, that was...
[34:47.070 --> 34:49.210]  This game is awesome. I think my controller
[34:49.210 --> 34:50.250]  was disconnected that game.
[34:50.970 --> 34:52.750]  That must have been it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:52.910 --> 34:55.170]  People are coming in like stealing your chargers and stuff, man.
[34:55.170 --> 34:56.030]  It's all fucked up.
[34:58.130 --> 34:59.130]  Alright, who's picking the color?
[34:59.890 --> 35:00.470]  That must be them.
[35:02.830 --> 35:03.150]  Bummer.
[35:06.270 --> 35:06.570]  Oh!
[35:06.870 --> 35:07.150]  Home!
[35:08.890 --> 35:10.230]  Does it change the color for you guys?
[35:12.370 --> 35:12.690]  Uh...
[35:12.690 --> 35:13.930]  I was looking down, sir. I missed it.
[35:13.950 --> 35:16.270]  I think it's always the color I pick. I pick captain.
[35:16.970 --> 35:18.670]  Oh, do we all have different colors? I'm white
[35:18.670 --> 35:20.330]  and yellow. I'm white. Oh, really?
[35:20.750 --> 35:21.750]  Oh, then what's the point?
[35:22.730 --> 35:24.630]  To make it harder for the editor if they
[35:24.630 --> 35:25.770]  need to switch between two colors.
[35:26.230 --> 35:26.950]  Yeah, no kidding.
[35:28.710 --> 35:29.890]  Oh my god!
[35:30.530 --> 35:31.350]  What the fuck?
[35:31.550 --> 35:33.590]  Dude, that was like right...
[35:33.590 --> 35:35.390]  I want to learn how to do that.
[35:36.110 --> 35:37.810]  Look at this. I like their look.
[35:38.510 --> 35:40.330]  Yeah. Mickey Mantle's being right there.
[35:41.190 --> 35:42.030]  Look at this.
[35:42.110 --> 35:44.310]  Off the wall. Yeah, I mean...
[35:44.310 --> 35:46.610]  See, that'll be us eventually. I was there too.
[35:46.990 --> 35:47.190]  Yep.
[35:47.750 --> 35:50.090]  Yeah, this is level 2, level 3, level 4.
[35:52.890 --> 35:53.410]  You.
[35:54.050 --> 35:54.450]  Thank you.
[35:54.730 --> 35:55.470]  There you go.
[35:56.370 --> 35:56.890]  Fuck!
[35:57.250 --> 35:59.390]  Hit him right in the head at least. Yep.
[35:59.810 --> 36:00.750]  Brain damage.
[36:04.480 --> 36:05.640]  Get down, get down.
[36:07.300 --> 36:07.780]  I just watched
[36:07.780 --> 36:09.320]  Casino last night.
[36:09.680 --> 36:10.920]  Two nights ago. Thank you.
[36:11.320 --> 36:12.080]  How many blue backs?
[36:12.900 --> 36:13.700]  I did.
[36:15.800 --> 36:16.720]  These guys are safe.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.180]  If they keep it up,
[36:19.560 --> 36:21.060]  we can put their head in a vice.
[36:21.620 --> 36:21.800]  Yep.
[36:22.580 --> 36:23.720]  It's always an option.
[36:24.420 --> 36:26.620]  Oh my god. Dude, that was just...
[36:26.620 --> 36:27.200]  That was ugly.
[36:29.340 --> 36:30.060]  Just ugly.
[36:31.420 --> 36:32.820]  Hope you guys like the mercy rule.
[36:32.980 --> 36:33.840]  You're going to be seeing it a lot.
[36:37.100 --> 36:38.680]  Where's the level zeros again?
[36:39.240 --> 36:39.820]  Yeah, no kidding.
[36:43.340 --> 36:44.440]  God, this game's...
[36:44.440 --> 36:46.280]  I'm already bad at this game like I am at
[36:46.840 --> 36:47.760]  Rocket League. Awesome.
[36:50.560 --> 36:52.620]  This guy just exposed himself
[36:52.620 --> 36:54.520]  to me.
[36:55.660 --> 36:56.460]  What, did he show you his
[36:56.460 --> 36:58.020]  wee-wee? A little bit.
[36:58.300 --> 37:00.320]  You want to play net, Eric? Yeah, I got it.
[37:00.500 --> 37:00.580]  Okay.
[37:02.040 --> 37:04.060]  I mean, I don't want to, but I'm gonna. Okay.
[37:06.680 --> 37:08.260]  Dude, these guys appear to know the rules
[37:08.260 --> 37:10.200]  of soccer. Boo!
[37:14.480 --> 37:15.800]  Oh, Andrew, you got this, Andrew!
[37:16.500 --> 37:18.080]  No pass! All you, all you, all you!
[37:18.180 --> 37:18.540]  Blast it!
[37:19.920 --> 37:20.360]  Oh!
[37:22.540 --> 37:23.680]  Thought too hard about it.
[37:23.760 --> 37:24.700]  You wanted it too much.
[37:31.040 --> 37:32.180]  Geoff and Gavin
[37:32.180 --> 37:34.200]  just sliding into the goal. Oh, Eric,
[37:34.380 --> 37:36.160]  I'm so sorry. Yep.
[37:36.580 --> 37:38.040]  Oh, he missed!
[37:38.380 --> 37:40.280]  He missed again!
[37:40.720 --> 37:42.000]  Get it out! Got it, got it, got it!
[37:44.180 --> 37:44.620]  Jesus!
[37:46.400 --> 37:48.080]  We need to help him!
[37:48.680 --> 37:51.060]  Can somebody do anything?
[37:51.060 --> 37:52.540]  You guys need to come get him!
[37:52.660 --> 37:54.800]  It would be awesome if I had any help!
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.980]  I was there, I was trying, but...
[37:56.980 --> 37:58.100]  Oh my god!
[37:58.300 --> 37:59.340]  Yeah, three of you were there.
[38:00.160 --> 38:02.460]  Oh, that was brutal! We just suck.
[38:03.080 --> 38:05.000]  It felt like nobody was there, but we were there.
[38:05.240 --> 38:05.860]  We were just bad.
[38:07.900 --> 38:08.300]  Oh!
[38:10.120 --> 38:10.580]  Oh!
[38:10.580 --> 38:10.700]  Oh!
[38:12.360 --> 38:13.520]  I like the idea.
[38:20.040 --> 38:23.580]  I got it to you, Andrew!
[38:25.200 --> 38:25.600]  In!
[38:25.760 --> 38:26.700]  Oh, god damn!
[38:27.820 --> 38:28.380]  Give me the ball!
[38:29.680 --> 38:30.740]  I want the ball!
[38:32.020 --> 38:33.740]  I'm on net, or whatever you said before.
[38:33.900 --> 38:34.460]  Yeah, you got it.
[38:35.680 --> 38:37.180]  Oh, he fucking... god damn.
[38:37.180 --> 38:37.660]  Take that!
[38:40.040 --> 38:40.480]  Oh!
[38:42.140 --> 38:43.620]  Now you're gonna get past me.
[38:43.800 --> 38:44.380]  Oh!
[38:48.420 --> 38:49.480]  Nice, nice, nice.
[38:49.920 --> 38:51.120]  Great play.
[38:54.820 --> 38:56.100]  I'm gonna throw up.
[38:57.980 --> 39:01.180]  You're doing great.
[39:02.940 --> 39:03.980]  Oh, what a play!
[39:04.660 --> 39:05.140]  Oh!
[39:10.400 --> 39:11.760]  All the way down.
[39:12.520 --> 39:14.000]  I'll catch him up, god, eventually.
[39:14.760 --> 39:15.720]  You got it, here comes the goal.
[39:15.960 --> 39:17.220]  You guys are just playing pass.
[39:18.320 --> 39:18.680]  Oh!
[39:19.540 --> 39:20.700]  What a shot!
[39:22.620 --> 39:23.360]  Oh, yeah!
[39:25.760 --> 39:26.840]  No, get it!
[39:31.410 --> 39:31.890]  Mercy!
[39:36.310 --> 39:36.730]  Oh, shit!
[39:38.150 --> 39:39.190]  Oh, yeah!
[39:40.550 --> 39:41.150]  Brutal.
[39:42.850 --> 39:43.430]  Brutal.
[39:44.270 --> 39:45.110]  Oh!
[39:50.030 --> 39:52.910]  This is gonna be a long career.
[39:53.610 --> 39:53.990]  Oh, yeah.
[39:54.210 --> 39:54.730]  Oh, man.
[39:56.190 --> 39:57.030]  Crazy.
[40:01.520 --> 40:03.780]  If I score a goal again...
[40:03.780 --> 40:05.780]  I won't let a single goal in.
[40:06.320 --> 40:07.620]  Oh, okay, that's great.
[40:07.820 --> 40:08.680]  I love that, actually.
[40:09.200 --> 40:10.560]  And that's my commitment to the team.
[40:10.840 --> 40:12.140]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[40:22.410 --> 40:23.530]  I'm locked in, man.
[40:24.050 --> 40:25.550]  I just wanted to point out how much
[40:25.550 --> 40:27.370]  I appreciate the mods right now.
[40:27.550 --> 40:28.390]  I really appreciate the mods.
[40:31.650 --> 40:32.710]  They are great.
[40:33.870 --> 40:34.090]  Yep.
[40:35.410 --> 40:35.810]  Home.
[40:36.630 --> 40:39.370]  Oh, shit!
[40:40.210 --> 40:41.090]  Doing away colors, baby.
[40:42.110 --> 40:43.350]  I'm gonna do away colors, then.
[40:43.530 --> 40:44.290]  Yeah, I'll lock in with you.
[40:44.690 --> 40:47.950]  Andrew's arm and fake leg are home colors for me.
[40:48.570 --> 40:49.010]  Oh, shit.
[40:49.230 --> 40:50.530]  These guys are leveled.
[40:50.770 --> 40:51.230]  This sucks.
[40:51.530 --> 40:52.910]  4, 3, 2, 1.
[40:53.650 --> 40:54.870]  I'm worried about gravy chip.
[40:56.810 --> 40:58.550]  They got a full squad here, boys.
[40:58.970 --> 40:59.530]  Don't worry.
[41:02.610 --> 41:03.510]  Coming right back, Geoff!
[41:03.710 --> 41:04.650]  Holy shit, Geoff!
[41:04.690 --> 41:05.950]  I thought you were facing the wrong way there.
[41:06.350 --> 41:06.710]  Geoff!
[41:09.590 --> 41:11.350]  Go to one side or the other!
[41:11.490 --> 41:12.570]  Stop sending it up the middle!
[41:15.210 --> 41:16.110]  I'm in a battle.
[41:17.070 --> 41:17.730]  Sorry, Eric.
[41:17.830 --> 41:18.430]  Oh, my God.
[41:25.580 --> 41:26.640]  Nice chase, Geoff.
[41:26.960 --> 41:27.700]  What a play.
[41:29.300 --> 41:30.100]  There you go, Andrew.
[41:31.500 --> 41:32.380]  Nice pass.
[41:32.900 --> 41:34.120]  Shoot, score, win.
[41:34.120 --> 41:34.860]  Damn it.
[41:39.080 --> 41:39.720]  Had that.
[41:40.500 --> 41:41.620]  There you go. Thank you.
[41:41.680 --> 41:42.500]  Thank you for clearing that out.
[41:42.540 --> 41:43.660]  I didn't like the look of this bitch.
[41:44.860 --> 41:45.720]  Oh, no. I still don't.
[41:48.380 --> 41:48.700]  Nice.
[41:51.320 --> 41:51.960]  Wrong side.
[41:53.620 --> 41:55.120]  That's what we want them to think.
[41:58.540 --> 41:59.180]  Coming through.
[41:59.180 --> 41:59.860]  Watch the middle.
[42:03.980 --> 42:05.140]  Watch the center.
[42:05.400 --> 42:05.800]  Watch the middle.
[42:06.640 --> 42:07.540]  Nice, Geoff.
[42:09.860 --> 42:10.380]  Oh!
[42:12.060 --> 42:12.580]  How?
[42:13.580 --> 42:14.280]  Oh, my God.
[42:16.180 --> 42:17.160]  There you go, Eric.
[42:17.440 --> 42:18.260]  It's all you, buddy.
[42:19.380 --> 42:20.620]  God damn it.
[42:22.360 --> 42:23.540]  Man, I'm not sure.
[42:23.780 --> 42:25.160]  Shooting is fucking hard.
[42:26.720 --> 42:27.460]  Oh, Geoff!
[42:27.960 --> 42:28.360]  Save.
[42:33.020 --> 42:34.240]  Look at that skill.
[42:34.340 --> 42:35.020]  How do they do it?
[42:40.510 --> 42:41.350]  Nice murder.
[42:42.450 --> 42:43.590]  Oh, God. He came through.
[42:43.690 --> 42:44.490]  The goalie came out.
[42:45.730 --> 42:46.290]  Long!
[42:46.450 --> 42:47.010]  Yes!
[42:48.750 --> 42:49.830]  There you go, Gavin.
[42:50.790 --> 42:52.410]  Way to go.
[42:52.690 --> 42:53.710]  Welcome to the jungle.
[42:55.070 --> 42:56.670]  We've got fun and games.
[42:58.010 --> 42:59.370]  Look at this shot.
[43:00.170 --> 43:00.730]  Beautiful.
[43:00.730 --> 43:02.130]  What a play.
[43:03.030 --> 43:04.770]  David Beckham from the halfway line.
[43:04.810 --> 43:06.850]  Dude, I fucking dig being a goalie.
[43:06.950 --> 43:07.810]  That's action right there.
[43:08.010 --> 43:08.650]  Come take it.
[43:08.930 --> 43:10.970]  I don't want it.
[43:12.150 --> 43:13.370]  I don't want it.
[43:13.430 --> 43:14.370]  I'll do it.
[43:17.810 --> 43:19.090]  I want to play forward.
[43:19.290 --> 43:20.190]  I don't want to be goal.
[43:21.210 --> 43:22.510]  That should be a rule in real footy.
[43:23.030 --> 43:23.770]  Oh, God damn it.
[43:24.610 --> 43:25.470]  Come take it?
[43:25.690 --> 43:26.650]  Come take it rule?
[43:28.570 --> 43:31.390]  Oh, God damn it.
[43:32.150 --> 43:32.550]  Gavin.
[43:33.370 --> 43:33.770]  Yeah!
[43:36.070 --> 43:37.210]  That's what I'm talking about.
[43:37.230 --> 43:38.610]  I think we have it right here.
[43:38.910 --> 43:40.010]  I think we have it right here.
[43:42.550 --> 43:43.790]  I think we got it.
[43:43.810 --> 43:45.210]  I think we got something figured out here.
[43:47.570 --> 43:48.370]  Hell yes.
[43:48.950 --> 43:50.090]  Way to go, boys.
[43:50.890 --> 43:52.250]  Way to go, boys.
[43:53.490 --> 43:53.890]  Boys.
[43:53.990 --> 43:55.790]  Geoff, you're welcome to come back and take this if you want it.
[43:56.170 --> 43:56.510]  I'll take it.
[43:56.510 --> 43:57.490]  Geoff, take it.
[43:57.650 --> 43:59.230]  I'll take it.
[43:59.450 --> 44:01.570]  Are they trying to own goal?
[44:04.230 --> 44:06.590]  Maybe they're going to get silly with it
[44:06.590 --> 44:07.810]  and be like, we don't even want to win.
[44:08.270 --> 44:09.610]  We're not even trying.
[44:10.370 --> 44:11.990]  We're practicing our trick shots.
[44:12.750 --> 44:14.510]  Don't you fucking score on me.
[44:16.470 --> 44:17.510]  Oh, Geoff!
[44:17.530 --> 44:18.730]  What a save!
[44:20.970 --> 44:22.010]  Looking phenomenal.
[44:23.490 --> 44:24.110]  Watch it.
[44:25.290 --> 44:26.170]  He's unstoppable.
[44:27.070 --> 44:28.110]  Eric, put it in.
[44:28.210 --> 44:28.930]  Put it in, son.
[44:30.930 --> 44:31.910]  God damn it.
[44:31.990 --> 44:33.250]  It's right to him every time.
[44:34.050 --> 44:35.390]  I don't know how to curve it.
[44:35.550 --> 44:38.110]  I don't know. It's tough.
[44:38.610 --> 44:38.790]  Oh!
[44:39.950 --> 44:41.530]  That was some lag for me.
[44:41.850 --> 44:43.470]  Yeah, it's lagging out.
[44:43.990 --> 44:45.270]  It's lagging like crazy.
[44:46.010 --> 44:46.750]  Uh-oh.
[44:50.190 --> 44:51.070]  Think the...
[44:51.070 --> 44:51.670]  Oh, no.
[44:51.670 --> 44:52.390]  It's right.
[44:53.710 --> 44:54.950]  Let me get in on this.
[44:56.870 --> 44:57.710]  Seafood team.
[44:59.730 --> 45:00.650]  Good job.
[45:01.490 --> 45:01.930]  Hey!
[45:03.410 --> 45:05.710]  It's okay. The clock's still running.
[45:05.810 --> 45:06.990]  We'll eventually win this way.
[45:07.670 --> 45:08.970]  This counts. This is still a victory.
[45:09.070 --> 45:09.810]  We still got two goals.
[45:11.650 --> 45:12.430]  Give me that.
[45:13.350 --> 45:15.590]  Somebody asked in the chat if more people are watching this
[45:15.590 --> 45:16.990]  than the World Cup. It's possible.
[45:18.850 --> 45:19.550]  It's the
[45:19.550 --> 45:21.030]  Club World Cup.
[45:22.630 --> 45:23.170]  Give it.
[45:23.250 --> 45:23.790]  Ball stuck.
[45:25.290 --> 45:25.870]  Got it.
[45:27.330 --> 45:29.390]  And this should be part of the actual game.
[45:32.750 --> 45:33.570]  One spot
[45:33.570 --> 45:35.270]  in the field is super glued
[45:35.270 --> 45:37.530]  and if the ball lands there, it's just hell.
[45:37.990 --> 45:39.170]  Ah, they got the glue spot.
[45:40.190 --> 45:41.470]  It turns into a medicine ball
[45:41.470 --> 45:42.250]  and it's heavy to kick.
[45:42.910 --> 45:43.010]  Oh!
[45:44.910 --> 45:46.570]  You can only kick the ball if you're worthy.
[45:49.370 --> 45:49.770]  Geoff!
[45:49.850 --> 45:50.650]  What a play!
[45:52.630 --> 45:53.330]  Way downfield.
[45:53.430 --> 45:53.670]  Good move.
[45:54.910 --> 45:56.870]  I was hoping they didn't have anyone in the net.
[45:57.110 --> 45:57.770]  I'll keep playing up.
[45:58.630 --> 45:59.190]  You're alright.
[46:00.710 --> 46:02.630]  Keep doing what we were doing before, boys. You got it.
[46:04.270 --> 46:04.910]  Oh, fuck!
[46:05.010 --> 46:05.450]  Geoff, no!
[46:06.750 --> 46:07.370]  It's okay.
[46:07.770 --> 46:08.370]  That's my fault.
[46:09.970 --> 46:11.910]  I could have been further back for you.
[46:11.990 --> 46:13.150]  I jumped too soon.
[46:13.150 --> 46:14.510]  I anticipated.
[46:14.770 --> 46:15.150]  It happens.
[46:16.190 --> 46:17.690]  That gravy chimp!
[46:18.150 --> 46:20.010]  I'm going to beat myself tonight.
[46:21.410 --> 46:22.410]  Opus die style.
[46:22.710 --> 46:23.610]  Like in Da Vinci Code.
[46:23.830 --> 46:25.010]  I'm just going to wall up my back
[46:25.010 --> 46:28.170]  with a fucking rope with knots on it.
[46:29.130 --> 46:30.570]  Knots are all little soccer balls.
[46:34.990 --> 46:36.550]  It'll never happen again.
[46:36.850 --> 46:37.010]  Shit.
[46:39.510 --> 46:40.910]  Oh, Andrew.
[46:40.910 --> 46:42.250]  Slide tackling.
[46:43.930 --> 46:44.970]  Give me a little fuck.
[46:46.530 --> 46:47.530]  Watch the cross.
[46:50.190 --> 46:51.210]  Oh, god damn it.
[46:54.410 --> 46:55.470]  Watch it spread out.
[46:57.330 --> 46:58.090]  Bad pass.
[46:58.650 --> 46:59.690]  There you go. Good spread.
[47:00.470 --> 47:01.870]  50 seconds. You're alright.
[47:03.510 --> 47:04.610]  Don't... yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:04.710 --> 47:06.250]  Just poke. Don't slide tackle. Just poke.
[47:06.910 --> 47:07.510]  How do you poke?
[47:08.570 --> 47:10.150]  B without holding left bumper.
[47:10.410 --> 47:10.690]  Oh, right.
[47:10.830 --> 47:11.790]  There you go, Geoff!
[47:14.250 --> 47:15.390]  Andrew, Andrew, you got it.
[47:19.030 --> 47:20.130]  Oh, god damn it.
[47:20.910 --> 47:22.210]  God fucking damn it.
[47:28.700 --> 47:29.940]  Now you go. Nice challenge, Andrew.
[47:30.340 --> 47:30.960]  Hit me, hit me, hit me.
[47:33.040 --> 47:34.040]  Oh, that's what we need.
[47:34.340 --> 47:34.760]  Go on, son.
[47:38.800 --> 47:39.520]  God damn you.
[47:39.520 --> 47:41.200]  It's wild to shoot from that far away.
[47:41.760 --> 47:42.600]  Oh, Geoff!
[47:44.140 --> 47:45.080]  What happened there?
[47:46.080 --> 47:47.700]  You reach for the stars.
[47:52.160 --> 47:53.780]  I don't even see what happened.
[47:54.080 --> 47:54.520]  Password, password, password.
[47:58.900 --> 48:00.380]  Alright, same thing. We got this. We got it.
[48:00.460 --> 48:01.180]  I made an oopsie.
[48:08.170 --> 48:09.950]  Oh, man. Leave it to me to me.
[48:11.570 --> 48:12.170]  Geoff!
[48:16.950 --> 48:19.210]  Very nice. Thank you.
[48:19.590 --> 48:20.190]  Gavin?
[48:22.150 --> 48:23.010]  Shoot it, Gavin!
[48:23.530 --> 48:25.110]  Shoot it, Gavin!
[48:25.570 --> 48:26.290]  Psyched him out!
[48:32.490 --> 48:34.310]  What a victory!
[48:34.610 --> 48:37.010]  I only got that because I accidentally shot the wrong way.
[48:37.410 --> 48:39.130]  Might have saved my ass there.
[48:39.690 --> 48:40.810]  That was brilliant, Gavin.
[48:40.810 --> 48:44.170]  That looked so on purpose.
[48:44.510 --> 48:44.930]  We won!
[48:45.550 --> 48:47.270]  They think I did that on purpose.
[48:47.870 --> 48:49.490]  They're so impressed right now.
[48:49.790 --> 48:50.590]  Way to go.
[48:51.350 --> 48:52.050]  Oh, man.
[48:52.570 --> 48:53.510]  Oh, Christ.
[48:55.810 --> 48:57.270]  Gavin with the hat trick.
[48:57.370 --> 48:57.890]  Way to go.
[48:58.090 --> 48:58.930]  My first hatty.
[48:59.990 --> 49:00.590]  Fantastic.
[49:02.210 --> 49:04.630]  There's so many achievements popping up. It's great.
[49:05.130 --> 49:06.550]  13 saves. That's not too bad.
[49:07.530 --> 49:09.170]  There's points and saves.
[49:09.170 --> 49:09.530]  Wow.
[49:10.030 --> 49:10.290]  Yeah.
[49:12.590 --> 49:14.310]  I'm going to keep getting better at being goalie.
[49:14.610 --> 49:15.650]  You're doing great.
[49:16.090 --> 49:17.290]  I'm working it out.
[49:18.790 --> 49:20.150]  What color are we picking?
[49:20.910 --> 49:21.590]  I'm doing away.
[49:22.390 --> 49:22.910]  Away.
[49:24.290 --> 49:24.530]  Home.
[49:32.960 --> 49:34.140]  Alright. Here we go.
[49:34.560 --> 49:35.920]  Good strategy. Same thing. Let's go.
[49:36.280 --> 49:36.480]  Okay.
[49:40.960 --> 49:41.720]  There you go.
[49:43.220 --> 49:43.820]  Andrew, go!
[49:44.120 --> 49:44.480]  Hell yeah!
[49:45.660 --> 49:46.060]  Easy.
[49:47.780 --> 49:48.340]  Way to go.
[49:49.680 --> 49:50.480]  Easy work.
[49:57.950 --> 49:58.750]  Geoff, you want to fall back?
[49:58.790 --> 49:59.390]  Yeah, I'll switch up.
[50:02.530 --> 50:03.030]  You in?
[50:03.190 --> 50:03.330]  Okay.
[50:06.710 --> 50:08.590]  Good spread. You got it.
[50:08.670 --> 50:09.670]  Nope. There you go.
[50:10.230 --> 50:11.870]  Press. Up.
[50:12.770 --> 50:13.590]  I got it.
[50:18.670 --> 50:19.070]  Yes.
[50:19.510 --> 50:20.570]  Gavin's coming up to your left.
[50:20.730 --> 50:21.510]  You got it.
[50:21.550 --> 50:22.350]  There we go!
[50:23.650 --> 50:24.670]  You got this.
[50:24.810 --> 50:25.610]  Way to go.
[50:25.950 --> 50:26.990]  So far away from it.
[50:27.970 --> 50:30.050]  I did not shoot where I wanted to,
[50:30.150 --> 50:31.950]  but he dove in a way that made it work.
[50:35.050 --> 50:35.850]  Great play.
[50:36.390 --> 50:37.370]  Okay. Geoff, I'll tag with you.
[50:43.990 --> 50:44.730]  Good poke.
[50:45.750 --> 50:46.870]  Gavin, you got it?
[50:48.890 --> 50:50.390]  There you go.
[50:52.710 --> 50:53.730]  You're fine.
[50:53.870 --> 50:56.390]  You guys are getting really good out there.
[50:57.930 --> 51:00.590]  I can't believe I misplayed that ball so bad.
[51:02.250 --> 51:05.230]  You're doing such a good job of maintaining control of the ball.
[51:07.810 --> 51:09.850]  Time of possession is totally out of whack.
[51:10.710 --> 51:12.730]  I hit X, and I thought...
[51:12.730 --> 51:13.830]  I thought I was just really early on it.
[51:13.890 --> 51:14.290]  I'm coming back.
[51:16.730 --> 51:17.050]  Shit.
[51:19.950 --> 51:20.710]  We're moving up, Geoff.
[51:20.790 --> 51:21.410]  We're coming back to you.
[51:24.930 --> 51:25.250]  Effort.
[51:26.790 --> 51:27.350]  It's alright.
[51:28.110 --> 51:28.770]  That's on us.
[51:28.890 --> 51:30.410]  I need to fall back when that's happening.
[51:32.770 --> 51:33.350]  Sorry, Geoff.
[51:33.550 --> 51:34.250]  It's okay. I'm sorry.
[51:36.090 --> 51:39.010]  We need to be better about not all being on the same half.
[51:39.490 --> 51:42.630]  We need to be better about not all being on the same half of the field.
[51:44.490 --> 51:45.370]  Gavin, just take it out.
[51:45.450 --> 51:45.850]  There you go.
[51:48.870 --> 51:49.230]  Nice.
[51:51.990 --> 51:52.690]  Lovely shit.
[51:52.830 --> 51:53.390]  Lovely shit.
[51:56.610 --> 51:57.070]  Go back.
[51:57.770 --> 51:58.570]  Alright, bitch.
[52:02.620 --> 52:03.120]  There you go.
[52:03.320 --> 52:03.520]  Good job, Geoff.
[52:05.840 --> 52:06.200]  Damn.
[52:09.420 --> 52:09.780]  Well...
[52:09.780 --> 52:10.460]  Oh, no.
[52:11.440 --> 52:12.240]  Oh, Geoff!
[52:13.520 --> 52:14.440]  Hell of a save.
[52:18.450 --> 52:19.290]  Oh, boys.
[52:21.570 --> 52:22.230]  We're coming back.
[52:25.510 --> 52:26.170]  Nice, Geoff.
[52:34.840 --> 52:35.640]  God damn it.
[52:35.840 --> 52:39.220]  We need to get a little deeper in the hole.
[52:39.760 --> 52:41.140]  Just deeper in the box, and we got it.
[52:41.440 --> 52:41.940]  There we go.
[52:44.620 --> 52:45.220]  There you go.
[52:45.220 --> 52:45.900]  God damn it.
[52:46.300 --> 52:46.940]  This is bad.
[52:48.520 --> 52:49.400]  You guys got it?
[52:49.520 --> 52:49.760]  We're back.
[52:52.560 --> 52:53.360]  Oh, nice.
[52:54.000 --> 52:54.880]  That was real nice.
[52:56.180 --> 52:57.220]  That's not where I was aiming.
[53:02.320 --> 53:03.120]  Oh, wow.
[53:05.520 --> 53:06.580]  Nice pressure, though.
[53:07.600 --> 53:08.020]  Going back?
[53:08.220 --> 53:08.900]  Gavin, you got it.
[53:12.760 --> 53:13.520]  This is a good shot.
[53:14.200 --> 53:14.540]  It's alright.
[53:15.680 --> 53:17.680]  Not much you can do against that one.
[53:17.800 --> 53:19.360]  That's just a diagonal cross.
[53:20.020 --> 53:20.220]  Yep.
[53:24.160 --> 53:25.560]  I'm surprised you didn't get to that.
[53:25.940 --> 53:26.820]  You did it alright.
[53:27.580 --> 53:27.800]  Yeah.
[53:28.700 --> 53:30.180]  I guess I was just a hair too late.
[53:36.090 --> 53:36.490]  Gavin?
[53:36.610 --> 53:37.930]  Oh, what a pass, Eric!
[53:38.850 --> 53:39.230]  Oh!
[53:40.110 --> 53:41.310]  I'm coming back. I'm coming back.
[53:41.450 --> 53:44.190]  Hey, Gavin, midfield. Gavin in the middle.
[53:44.290 --> 53:45.170]  Gavin in the middle.
[53:45.650 --> 53:46.270]  Oh, shit.
[53:50.040 --> 53:50.920]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[53:51.000 --> 53:51.860]  I thought you were still there.
[53:52.300 --> 53:52.380]  Fuck.
[53:56.880 --> 53:57.280]  Ah!
[53:59.040 --> 53:59.620]  Damn it.
[54:05.250 --> 54:06.490]  How do you back pass?
[54:07.710 --> 54:08.550]  It's the direction.
[54:08.830 --> 54:10.070]  You hold X,
[54:10.150 --> 54:11.170]  and then you have the whole...
[54:11.170 --> 54:12.290]  You can use the stick.
[54:12.510 --> 54:12.670]  Yeah.
[54:15.870 --> 54:16.570]  Alright, nice.
[54:16.910 --> 54:17.550]  Oh, go, Eric!
[54:18.290 --> 54:19.130]  So will you, Eric.
[54:19.130 --> 54:20.430]  Get right in there.
[54:21.370 --> 54:21.810]  Oh!
[54:22.510 --> 54:22.890]  How?
[54:24.510 --> 54:25.790]  Oh, my God.
[54:29.030 --> 54:30.050]  Killing me here.
[54:30.930 --> 54:31.670]  Oh, no.
[54:32.130 --> 54:33.630]  Had a big lag jump there.
[54:35.970 --> 54:36.410]  Shit.
[54:38.630 --> 54:39.410]  Going back for it.
[54:39.450 --> 54:40.450]  Not sure what he was going for there.
[54:41.930 --> 54:42.310]  There you go.
[54:42.590 --> 54:45.130]  I just have no sprint.
[54:47.970 --> 54:50.090]  Right bumper X is how you chip it.
[54:50.690 --> 54:50.890]  Yep.
[54:55.030 --> 54:55.830]  Coming back.
[54:56.350 --> 54:56.890]  It's alright.
[55:01.500 --> 55:02.220]  Damn it.
[55:02.300 --> 55:02.580]  Oh!
[55:03.560 --> 55:04.380]  Nice, Geoff.
[55:07.380 --> 55:07.660]  I got it.
[55:09.520 --> 55:10.280]  Get to the middle.
[55:10.580 --> 55:11.480]  Get to the middle of the far side.
[55:12.460 --> 55:12.680]  Andrew!
[55:13.520 --> 55:14.300]  Ah, good try.
[55:15.360 --> 55:16.120]  You gotta get him.
[55:16.340 --> 55:16.440]  Oh!
[55:16.440 --> 55:16.480]  Damn!
[55:17.140 --> 55:22.060]  Oh, what a grab.
[55:22.060 --> 55:22.960]  Nice steal.
[55:24.080 --> 55:25.200]  Oh, wow.
[55:26.620 --> 55:27.180]  Damn.
[55:28.780 --> 55:29.460]  Uh-oh.
[55:29.560 --> 55:30.620]  Working back, working back.
[55:30.980 --> 55:31.660]  You're alright, you're alright.
[55:32.140 --> 55:32.340]  Oh!
[55:34.360 --> 55:41.060]  I think Geoff's weakness
[55:41.060 --> 55:42.680]  is the ball coming to him.
[55:43.300 --> 55:44.800]  Let's see what happens during this replay.
[55:48.100 --> 55:48.820]  I just...
[55:48.820 --> 55:49.360]  I just...
[55:49.360 --> 55:50.780]  Every once in a while, you know,
[55:50.800 --> 55:52.420]  I, uh...
[55:52.420 --> 55:53.680]  It's what I gotta work through.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.500]  It's not I gotta work through.
[55:57.180 --> 55:58.580]  If the ball was a car,
[55:58.640 --> 55:59.340]  you did the right thing.
[55:59.720 --> 56:00.860]  The panic movements.
[56:04.460 --> 56:04.860]  There you go.
[56:05.940 --> 56:08.360]  There you go.
[56:11.120 --> 56:12.280]  That's trying to chip it to you.
[56:12.540 --> 56:13.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:23.600 --> 56:24.120]  Nice.
[56:24.820 --> 56:26.500]  God, I don't have any effort left.
[56:26.860 --> 56:27.860]  Where is everyone?
[56:28.220 --> 56:28.460]  Hello!
[56:30.740 --> 56:32.000]  There you go!
[56:32.140 --> 56:34.180]  Oh my god, how did I miss that?
[56:35.660 --> 56:36.560]  I'm sorry.
[56:36.820 --> 56:37.180]  That's okay.
[56:39.560 --> 56:40.820]  Oh, Andrew, lovely stuff!
[56:40.940 --> 56:41.220]  There we go.
[56:41.280 --> 56:43.060]  Way to tie it.
[56:43.880 --> 56:44.400]  Andrew.
[56:45.580 --> 56:47.040]  Saving my ass, Andrew.
[56:48.140 --> 56:49.140]  Way to go.
[56:49.140 --> 56:49.320]  Way to go.
[56:50.560 --> 56:52.100]  This is 456.
[56:52.720 --> 56:53.740]  It's almost there.
[56:53.860 --> 56:55.620]  Get right on to the end, boys.
[56:56.620 --> 56:57.760]  I love this game.
[56:58.680 --> 57:00.380]  I might really, really like this a lot.
[57:02.940 --> 57:04.800]  I'm gonna have to take the goal
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.420]  way too seriously, though.
[57:10.360 --> 57:11.780]  Oh, Geoff, what are you doing?
[57:13.100 --> 57:14.060]  I don't...
[57:14.060 --> 57:14.640]  I'm learning.
[57:14.640 --> 57:14.760]  I'm learning.
[57:16.700 --> 57:17.460]  Okay.
[57:18.740 --> 57:19.420]  Overtime!
[57:21.080 --> 57:21.900]  This is it.
[57:23.240 --> 57:24.660]  Oh, he got rainbowed.
[57:26.580 --> 57:28.300]  Take that, rainbow man.
[57:28.620 --> 57:29.880]  Take this!
[57:32.420 --> 57:34.180]  Get it up, that's Eric.
[57:34.440 --> 57:34.940]  Nice!
[57:37.080 --> 57:38.340]  No one around!
[57:39.340 --> 57:39.720]  Andrew!
[57:40.160 --> 57:42.660]  Good try, Noda. You did everything right.
[57:45.340 --> 57:46.340]  This is tough.
[57:46.420 --> 57:47.880]  I'm chasing it, I'm giving it everything.
[57:49.800 --> 57:50.700]  There you go.
[57:52.040 --> 57:53.360]  I got nothing left.
[57:53.760 --> 57:54.940]  I got nothing left.
[57:55.980 --> 57:56.860]  We'll get there.
[57:57.720 --> 57:58.460]  There you go.
[57:59.020 --> 58:00.300]  Here we go.
[58:04.490 --> 58:06.050]  Going to you, Eric.
[58:06.570 --> 58:07.750]  Oh, look at this!
[58:08.330 --> 58:09.650]  Oh, fuck me!
[58:12.350 --> 58:13.370]  What a play!
[58:13.370 --> 58:14.010]  Ah!
[58:15.510 --> 58:16.910]  Shouldn't be slide-tackling there.
[58:17.690 --> 58:19.310]  It's so tough to remember to
[58:19.310 --> 58:20.550]  release the sphere.
[58:20.970 --> 58:21.930]  It's the hardest part of the game.
[58:23.010 --> 58:24.470]  Get in, get in, boys. You got it.
[58:24.550 --> 58:26.770]  Get in there. You're alright.
[58:27.510 --> 58:28.130]  Get after him.
[58:29.830 --> 58:30.850]  Got it. There you go!
[58:31.090 --> 58:31.410]  Andrew!
[58:34.910 --> 58:35.610]  There you go.
[58:36.310 --> 58:37.250]  God damn it.
[58:40.970 --> 58:41.410]  Ah!
[58:42.590 --> 58:43.970]  Fall back, fall back.
[58:44.050 --> 58:44.490]  Get defense.
[58:45.990 --> 58:46.790]  Fuck.
[58:47.550 --> 58:48.750]  Good try.
[58:50.350 --> 58:51.890]  Now that is tragic.
[58:52.530 --> 58:53.610]  It's the silence
[58:53.610 --> 58:54.430]  from Geoff.
[58:59.110 --> 59:01.750]  I just saw it going out
[59:01.750 --> 59:02.930]  and I...
[59:07.050 --> 59:08.650]  One more?
[59:08.650 --> 59:10.750]  I'm going to have to because it's not 5-0-1 yet.
[59:10.990 --> 59:12.610]  I'm going to have to disappear for a couple of months
[59:12.610 --> 59:13.790]  and come back good as this.
[59:18.050 --> 59:19.910]  This game is really fun.
[59:20.090 --> 59:21.370]  This game is great.
[59:21.730 --> 59:24.750]  I just know internally that I have so much
[59:24.750 --> 59:26.670]  room to improve. There are things I know
[59:26.670 --> 59:28.350]  I'm just missing and mechanics that
[59:28.350 --> 59:30.090]  I still need to get.
[59:31.830 --> 59:32.630]  It's the...
[59:33.170 --> 59:34.990]  It's something I'm excited to get better at.
[59:35.550 --> 59:36.910]  I don't know the buttons.
[59:36.910 --> 59:37.710]  Yeah.
[59:38.890 --> 59:41.410]  All I know is left trigger and Y as a defensive button.
[59:41.490 --> 59:41.890]  That's it.
[59:42.150 --> 59:42.950]  What color are we doing?
[59:44.430 --> 59:45.850]  I went away.
[59:46.190 --> 59:47.350]  Just walked in on away.
[59:48.750 --> 59:49.870]  Alright, this is the last one.
[59:52.990 --> 59:54.310]  Entering stadium. This is it, boys.
[59:55.310 --> 59:55.610]  Alright.
[59:56.210 --> 59:57.150]  Back to the jungle.
[59:58.050 --> 59:59.370]  Is there an old man on that team?
[01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.030]  Is there?
[01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:03.330]  Oh!
[01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.450]  God damn it. That was pretty cool.
[01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:07.510]  Felt really good about that slide
[01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:09.530]  daggle. Andrew, you got it. Andrew, you got it. Andrew, you.
[01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:10.070]  Andrew, you.
[01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:11.770]  Damn it.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.780]  Son of a bitch with that
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.120]  move.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.540]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.020]  We got it.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.340]  Do you? Eric.
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.420]  Good try.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.640]  It was just long. It was just too long.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:34.400]  Oh!
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:34.760]  Oh!
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.000]  Shit.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.260]  Trying to get to the middle.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.300]  Nice, Geoff.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.340]  Oh!
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.000]  There you go. Oh, great, Gavin.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.560]  Damn it. How did I miss that?
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:01.860]  What a...
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.840]  What a grab.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.040]  Effort, effort, effort, effort.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.740]  Give me too far.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.980]  Across his own goal.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:12.760]  Interesting move.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.780]  Yeah, good rainbow.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.280]  Oh, damn.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.580]  I thought you had that, Gavin. I'm sorry.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.860]  I almost never do.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.160]  Reflection.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.200]  Oh, Geoff, stop.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.080]  Phenomenal.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:27.700]  Damn it.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.520]  They blocked it.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:34.360]  Hey, Gavin.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:34.420]  Damn it.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:44.600]  Shit.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:45.920]  You're alright.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.560]  Nice.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:51.680]  Damn.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.940]  Spread out a little bit.
[01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:58.600]  I'll go this far side.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.280]  Nice, Geoff. Andrew, coming to you.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.080]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:02.940]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.960]  Oh, goodbye then.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.220]  Well, it's 5-0-1.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.960]  We got this game.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.080]  It's the best time of the week.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.780]  Let's see how it goes.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.860]  Eric, your game chat's open.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.760]  Who gives a fuck? I don't have a microphone.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.000]  Alright, I'm taking it out. Gavin, press up.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.020]  Andrew, you got it.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.260]  I pressed up on the D-pad.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.380]  Jesus Christ, there you go.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.280]  That's all we need.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.160]  It's just the tag team of Eric and Andrew.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.160]  That's all we need.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.300]  Way to go. Good job.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.760]  You said press up and my guy said good job.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.340]  That's the team effort right there, boys.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.000]  A goal at 5-0-1.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:52.960]  What else could you ask for?
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.740]  Oh, Eric.
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:54.780]  Oh, Eric.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.400]  That's too far to take that shot.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.220]  They're going deep.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.460]  Yep, yep.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.180]  You're alright, Geoff. You're alright.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:08.900]  You got it.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.700]  There you go, Andrew.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.860]  Good stuff.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.460]  I didn't think there was any shot they were getting that.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.300]  Watch the comeback.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.520]  Oh, Geoff, nice.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.720]  Oh, wow.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.000]  There you go.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:25.980]  I'm fine.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.360]  Go, go, go.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:29.760]  Me and you.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:31.640]  Nice.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.220]  I got it.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.760]  I'm sorry, that was way too far forward.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.320]  That's my fault.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.340]  Coming back for you, Geoff.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.260]  You're alright, Geoff. We're coming.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.080]  Spread out, spread out.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.860]  God damn it.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.400]  There's nowhere to go.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.560]  Ah, good try.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:03.900]  Fuck.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.500]  Someone twat their mic.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:08.820]  Yeah, that was me.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.480]  That just fucking dinked in.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.140]  Jetspud, thanks for the five gifted subs.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:14.360]  Fuck.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.280]  God damn it.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.240]  That goal against us, dedicated to Jetspud.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.720]  Geoff, play it.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.180]  There you go.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.320]  The immediate snicker by you.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.800]  Did not mean to hit that button.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.040]  Oh.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.360]  Got it.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:41.820]  There you go.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.440]  Ah, shit.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.140]  Sorry, I didn't...
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.160]  That was like trying to move the aim at the same time.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.140]  I saw, I saw.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:52.920]  Coming back.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.540]  Hey, buddy.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.520]  Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:58.640]  Nice.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.080]  Andrew.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.740]  Good try, good try.
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:11.360]  Oh my god.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.220]  Ah, shit.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.300]  Fuck.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.780]  Those deflections are tough.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.220]  This game sucks.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.720]  Oh, my game crashed.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.440]  It crashed.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.280]  I just kept hitting A, the game crashed.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:38.040]  Well.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.520]  There you have it.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.100]  Well, there you go, boys. Thank you so much.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.580]  Thanks for joining. I just kept hitting A.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.220]  I'm like, skip it, skip it, skip it, skip it.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.520]  And then all of a sudden, it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.660]  Well, that sucked.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.300]  Well, thank you so much for watching.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.440]  Appreciate you guys being here on a Friday.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.360]  I think you're definitely going to see
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.040]  more of that game.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.420]  What a wet cock of an ending.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.260]  What a wet cock of an ending, yeah.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.240]  Well, guys, we'll see you next time.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.260]  Appreciate you guys.

[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.240]  Check out the

[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.460]  if you're watching it live. And don't forget,

[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:22.760]  Thank you guys for watching.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.060]  We got a special Gumpler video this weekend, right?
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.280]  We sure do.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.640]  Yeah, we do.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.020]  Great, guys. Thanks a lot for backing me up on that one.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.500]  Check out our special Gumpler video on Sunday.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.760]  I believe it's
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:35.880]  for Patreon.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.540]  Or is it public? I don't know.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.080]  Public video. There you go. Everybody keep your
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.860]  eyeballs open and your ear holes listening
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.780]  because we're going to gump.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:46.960]  Just half the information coming at everyone
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.180]  and they don't know what the fuck's going on.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.660]  Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you next time.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.660]  Patreon.com slash regulationpod. Bye.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:53.360]  Bye now.
