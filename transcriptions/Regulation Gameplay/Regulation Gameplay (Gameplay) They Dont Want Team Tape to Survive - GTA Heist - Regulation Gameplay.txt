[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  We're back with another heist part. You guys ready? We're near the end.
[00:03.720 --> 00:05.860]  Yeah, we all turned on music.
[00:06.200 --> 00:08.000]  Gavin has music on, so we all turned on music.
[00:08.580 --> 00:10.260]  Yeah, and I think we're ready to go.
[00:10.300 --> 00:11.140]  Gavin, you ready to go?
[00:11.480 --> 00:12.640]  Ready to go, son.
[00:13.220 --> 00:14.000]  OK, let's do it.
[00:14.300 --> 00:16.280]  OK, we're doing the hack. We got to hack this thing.
[00:16.480 --> 00:17.460]  We got to hack it.
[00:17.560 --> 00:20.660]  Borrow a hacking rig from Revival High School in Vinewood.
[00:21.740 --> 00:22.660]  Oh, borrow it.
[00:22.900 --> 00:24.180]  OK, we're decoys.
[00:25.340 --> 00:27.660]  OK, I'm the transporter.
[00:28.080 --> 00:30.200]  Mass style creatures, thugs, hockey, tactical.
[00:30.380 --> 00:31.520]  Dude, where is tape?
[00:31.620 --> 00:33.280]  They don't want us to be tape, Gavin.
[00:34.040 --> 00:36.600]  I guess team tape can't be a threesome.
[00:36.940 --> 00:37.780]  It's terrible.
[00:38.400 --> 00:40.000]  We're going to do great. Let's do it, boys.
[00:40.320 --> 00:43.580]  Good. Oh, hey, I'm an honorary team tape member this time.
[00:43.660 --> 00:44.880]  You are. It's true.
[00:45.480 --> 00:48.120]  I think I'm going to go back through all the GTA videos
[00:48.120 --> 00:52.180]  I was in and try and wear, buy in real life every outfit I wore over the years.
[00:52.340 --> 00:53.360]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[00:54.380 --> 00:56.040]  OK, where are we supposed to go, Nick?
[00:56.040 --> 00:57.380]  You got to go to this thing.
[00:57.400 --> 00:58.220]  A new market?
[00:58.380 --> 00:59.460]  Yeah, I set a waypoint, but
[01:00.500 --> 01:01.140]  I'll let you know.
[01:01.820 --> 01:03.200]  Doesn't doesn't look like it starts moving.
[01:03.300 --> 01:04.800]  It looks like we should be good and just going that way.
[01:05.140 --> 01:05.540]  OK, sweet.
[01:06.080 --> 01:06.840]  Oh, my God.
[01:07.060 --> 01:07.380]  For some reason.
[01:07.720 --> 01:09.760]  You don't keep keep going straight.
[01:09.800 --> 01:12.620]  You're going to hang a left at this main intersection here.
[01:13.140 --> 01:14.200]  Turn here. Yep. Yep. Left here.
[01:14.980 --> 01:16.800]  You're going to you're going to follow this
[01:18.660 --> 01:19.680]  like all the way.
[01:20.040 --> 01:22.140]  And then okie doke, like you don't have to go anywhere.
[01:22.180 --> 01:23.600]  You just keep going straight as fast as you can.
[01:24.460 --> 01:26.280]  Oh, unless you see motorcycles and hit them.
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.580]  Oh, well, I mean, that's the rule.
[01:28.700 --> 01:29.400]  The rules of the road.
[01:29.860 --> 01:31.120]  Get away. Get away.
[01:31.540 --> 01:33.260]  What is that?
[01:34.300 --> 01:35.300]  Oh, shit.
[01:35.980 --> 01:37.560]  What? Oh, oh, getting squirrely.
[01:38.000 --> 01:38.520]  What happened?
[01:38.860 --> 01:41.240]  What? Andrew.
[01:42.600 --> 01:44.620]  We didn't even do anything.
[01:45.180 --> 01:46.660]  Andrew was in the kitchen.
[01:47.520 --> 01:48.860]  Gavin scared me.
[01:49.800 --> 01:52.100]  What? Gavin scared me.
[01:52.100 --> 01:53.940]  Is it because he didn't have a creature mask?
[01:54.140 --> 01:55.740]  He kept trying to hit me with his car.
[01:55.900 --> 01:59.000]  And so I pulled a grenade out to say, hey, hey, get back, get back.
[01:59.100 --> 02:00.440]  But the pin came out, I guess.
[02:00.660 --> 02:04.100]  And the pin came out.
[02:05.480 --> 02:05.880]  Whoopsie.
[02:06.020 --> 02:08.940]  He was just holding up a grenade, cooking it in his hands.
[02:09.460 --> 02:10.780]  Guys, something happened with the pin.
[02:11.960 --> 02:12.740]  It flew out.
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.060]  I'm going to leave a bad review to that weapon maker.
[02:20.340 --> 02:20.900]  All right.
[02:20.900 --> 02:22.720]  I'm sure they'll take you under advisement.
[02:22.780 --> 02:23.220]  Uh-huh.
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.020]  Mm-hmm.
[02:24.020 --> 02:26.480]  All right, let's do it.
[02:26.480 --> 02:27.100]  Gavin, you want to ride?
[02:27.940 --> 02:28.800]  Whose car is this?
[02:29.560 --> 02:30.480]  Is it the red one?
[02:30.700 --> 02:31.860]  Yeah, it's mine.
[02:32.480 --> 02:32.880]  Nice.
[02:33.760 --> 02:34.160]  Thanks.
[02:35.360 --> 02:36.480]  I think he was pretty sure it was free.
[02:36.960 --> 02:38.280]  Oh, did the waypoint pop now?
[02:39.100 --> 02:39.620]  Oh, it did.
[02:39.940 --> 02:40.820]  Cool. That's good.
[02:41.300 --> 02:42.160]  All right, I'll just follow you then.
[02:42.680 --> 02:44.160]  Yep. I'm I'm very sorry.
[02:45.280 --> 02:45.680]  Why?
[02:47.980 --> 02:49.100]  The rules of the road.
[02:49.100 --> 02:52.580]  I'm very, I'm very sorry.
[03:00.640 --> 03:02.220]  Oh, he apologized.
[03:02.480 --> 03:03.240]  What else do you want?
[03:03.320 --> 03:04.280]  Yeah, man.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.160]  Yeah.
[03:05.500 --> 03:06.480]  Jesus Christ.
[03:06.680 --> 03:07.840]  How do you jump the most thing?
[03:08.160 --> 03:09.780]  Canadian accident I've ever had.
[03:14.180 --> 03:14.900]  Where are you?
[03:15.020 --> 03:15.620]  Oh, hi, Gavin.
[03:15.860 --> 03:16.300]  What's up, man?
[03:17.980 --> 03:19.360]  Whose car is that, by the way?
[03:19.440 --> 03:19.980]  Did you find out?
[03:20.520 --> 03:20.700]  All right.
[03:21.340 --> 03:21.780]  Mine.
[03:22.100 --> 03:22.740]  I said that.
[03:23.120 --> 03:24.180]  There's a whole conversation.
[03:24.620 --> 03:25.900]  Oh, sorry.
[03:26.140 --> 03:28.320]  I saw the bike and my bloodlust.
[03:29.120 --> 03:30.520]  Everything just went red.
[03:31.800 --> 03:33.500]  I became a bull after that.
[03:34.940 --> 03:37.740]  I love how often we just immediately ignore each other.
[03:38.120 --> 03:38.840]  I was editing that.
[03:40.760 --> 03:41.340]  What was it?
[03:41.460 --> 03:42.480]  Was it a gurple?
[03:43.220 --> 03:44.000]  The throat lavidia?
[03:44.420 --> 03:44.980]  Oh, yeah.
[03:44.980 --> 03:46.680]  I asked a question and Nick got it.
[03:46.860 --> 03:48.080]  I'm like, yeah, I don't know.
[03:49.460 --> 03:51.080]  I feel like he just said it.
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.240]  All right, here it is.
[03:57.480 --> 03:58.560]  Oh, we're just taking the van.
[03:58.660 --> 03:59.780]  OK, that's what it looks like.
[03:59.860 --> 04:01.360]  You probably should park right in front of it.
[04:03.040 --> 04:03.660]  So, Gavin.
[04:03.880 --> 04:04.640]  Cool. Thanks, man.
[04:06.380 --> 04:07.740]  We have to wait for Andrew to get here.
[04:08.100 --> 04:09.240]  What are you doing?
[04:09.400 --> 04:10.260]  I'm almost there.
[04:11.580 --> 04:12.580]  I just hit a hill.
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.100]  Here, I got it out of the way.
[04:15.840 --> 04:16.420]  Thanks, man.
[04:16.420 --> 04:17.020]  Oh, I'm flying.
[04:17.620 --> 04:18.000]  You're welcome.
[04:18.660 --> 04:19.740]  I want to get in the back.
[04:19.860 --> 04:20.840]  How'd you get in the back?
[04:21.260 --> 04:21.860]  I got in.
[04:22.840 --> 04:23.240]  No!
[04:24.280 --> 04:25.460]  Oh, you're not in? What are you doing?
[04:25.500 --> 04:26.320]  Just looking at the van?
[04:26.600 --> 04:27.000]  Ow!
[04:31.640 --> 04:32.200]  Watch it!
[04:32.880 --> 04:34.380]  Back. OK, we're in.
[04:35.080 --> 04:35.760]  Here comes Andrew.
[04:36.100 --> 04:36.940]  You know what to do.
[04:37.780 --> 04:38.100]  Oh!
[04:39.020 --> 04:39.900]  You didn't even have to try.
[04:40.160 --> 04:41.360]  Andrew did it.
[04:42.820 --> 04:44.860]  Oh, I'm so close to death.
[04:45.260 --> 04:46.240]  That was awesome.
[04:46.240 --> 04:47.560]  Eat your piece of cheese, Donny.
[04:47.780 --> 04:48.800]  Where are you going?
[04:48.960 --> 04:49.560]  Get inside.
[04:49.880 --> 04:50.640]  What are you doing?
[04:50.860 --> 04:52.140]  I'm the transporter.
[04:52.380 --> 04:54.600]  I feel like I should be driving, but that's fine.
[04:54.880 --> 04:55.500]  Oh, you are fine.
[04:56.060 --> 04:57.320]  You know, it's fine. It's fine.
[04:57.340 --> 04:57.940]  I got to eat.
[04:58.200 --> 04:59.540]  Probably not a good idea to combine them.
[05:00.100 --> 05:03.380]  I don't remember the transporter getting hit by a car on a bicycle.
[05:03.760 --> 05:04.520]  Jesus Christ.
[05:05.020 --> 05:07.300]  Maybe when he was in Crank.
[05:07.320 --> 05:07.860]  Oh, there he goes.
[05:07.860 --> 05:09.140]  When he was in a different movie.
[05:09.680 --> 05:09.940]  Yeah.
[05:12.060 --> 05:13.780]  The transporter in Crank.
[05:14.320 --> 05:16.020]  I mean, he plays the same character
[05:16.020 --> 05:17.180]  in like every movie, right?
[05:18.340 --> 05:18.700]  Yeah.
[05:23.120 --> 05:26.100]  Jason Statham is a little typecast, but I mean, he's good at it.
[05:32.480 --> 05:32.840]  Woo!
[05:33.000 --> 05:33.820]  What's Lester saying?
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.260]  That doesn't matter.
[05:36.480 --> 05:39.080]  Yeah, I got to I got to go with Andrew on this one.
[05:39.920 --> 05:42.880]  Hey, so are there like quick action buttons on console
[05:42.880 --> 05:45.240]  to like put on armor and all that stuff faster?
[05:46.060 --> 05:46.800]  On the weapon wheel.
[05:47.980 --> 05:48.480]  Oh, really?
[05:48.520 --> 05:50.560]  If you open the weapon wheel, there's like
[05:50.560 --> 05:52.500]  I think it's A or X or something to
[05:54.220 --> 05:56.720]  eat and also restock armor.
[05:56.940 --> 05:57.300]  That's great.
[05:57.300 --> 05:57.440]  What?
[05:59.640 --> 06:00.320]  I had no idea.
[06:00.360 --> 06:00.980]  You haven't been reading the comments?
[06:01.760 --> 06:02.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:03.060 --> 06:03.780]  People in the comments.
[06:03.860 --> 06:04.900]  Oh, cool. I'm going to go first person.
[06:05.200 --> 06:07.160]  They're going to be mad for five more videos.
[06:07.440 --> 06:07.720]  Oh, yeah.
[06:09.320 --> 06:10.140]  That's a real shame.
[06:10.280 --> 06:10.780]  Oh, mask on.
[06:11.100 --> 06:12.260]  Mask on!
[06:16.070 --> 06:18.010]  Are we just killing these people?
[06:18.810 --> 06:19.730]  Yeah. Yeah, smoke them.
[06:19.870 --> 06:20.730]  Oh, wow. There are.
[06:20.730 --> 06:22.350]  Oh, I shot that woman.
[06:22.510 --> 06:22.950]  Whoops.
[06:23.090 --> 06:23.770]  Oh my God.
[06:27.210 --> 06:28.090]  Waste them boys.
[06:29.790 --> 06:30.490]  Moving up.
[06:34.270 --> 06:35.090]  Oh my God.
[06:35.170 --> 06:35.570]  Someone's-
[06:35.570 --> 06:36.110]  I'm almost dead.
[06:38.650 --> 06:39.510]  That's the weapon wheel.
[06:39.630 --> 06:41.270]  Oh, here we go.
[06:41.610 --> 06:42.150]  Up is to eat.
[06:42.670 --> 06:42.810]  Yep.
[06:43.070 --> 06:44.070]  Right stick is armor.
[06:44.270 --> 06:44.830]  OK, sweet.
[06:46.070 --> 06:47.170]  I found out. Thanks.
[06:47.370 --> 06:48.490]  Thanks, audience.
[06:49.750 --> 06:50.850]  Thanks for letting us know.
[06:51.510 --> 06:52.690]  I've only been playing-
[06:52.690 --> 06:54.470]  Wow, it makes this so much easier.
[06:54.810 --> 06:55.250]  This is great.
[06:55.670 --> 06:56.830]  Getting fucking greemed.
[06:57.690 --> 06:58.590]  Oh, yeah, that's wild.
[07:01.990 --> 07:03.450]  I'm cooking the competition.
[07:05.990 --> 07:06.830]  Is there someone on the roof?
[07:07.490 --> 07:09.230]  Yeah, I'm going to move up and see if I can get him.
[07:10.770 --> 07:11.970]  Nice grenade toss.
[07:12.030 --> 07:12.730]  Let's see if we got him.
[07:13.130 --> 07:13.490]  Almost.
[07:13.650 --> 07:14.110]  Oh, God.
[07:14.430 --> 07:15.310]  They're everywhere.
[07:15.910 --> 07:16.650]  Oh, wow.
[07:19.110 --> 07:19.770]  Oh, shit.
[07:21.610 --> 07:23.550]  Oh, above us, above us, above us.
[07:23.970 --> 07:25.190]  All right, I'm going to have to use a gun.
[07:27.090 --> 07:28.610]  Were you just using grenades this whole time?
[07:28.750 --> 07:29.650]  I was using a grenade launcher.
[07:30.290 --> 07:30.610]  What?
[07:32.070 --> 07:32.470]  What?
[07:33.610 --> 07:34.630]  He's all about safety.
[07:36.290 --> 07:36.690]  Ow.
[07:36.830 --> 07:37.630]  I'm going to try to flank him.
[07:38.330 --> 07:38.550]  Ow.
[07:39.170 --> 07:40.050]  Oh, you're dead.
[07:43.010 --> 07:43.810]  What happened?
[07:44.550 --> 07:46.510]  He climbed the ladder and got eviscerated.
[07:46.730 --> 07:47.770]  Why did you do that?
[07:48.310 --> 07:49.670]  I was trying to get an advantage point.
[07:49.670 --> 07:51.170]  Did it work?
[07:51.470 --> 07:52.350]  I gave them one.
[07:52.750 --> 07:53.610]  Oh, got it.
[07:54.810 --> 07:55.510]  Here we go.
[07:56.930 --> 07:58.270]  Let's take us to the opposite side.
[07:58.290 --> 07:58.630]  Oh, OK.
[07:59.990 --> 08:00.390]  Oh!
[08:02.950 --> 08:03.350]  Nice!
[08:04.590 --> 08:05.070]  Way to go, Gavin.
[08:05.990 --> 08:07.670]  Wait for your team to get into the van.
[08:08.010 --> 08:08.710]  Oh, come on!
[08:09.930 --> 08:12.890]  Hey, guys.
[08:14.010 --> 08:14.730]  OK, mask up!
[08:14.950 --> 08:15.170]  All right.
[08:15.950 --> 08:16.750]  All right, cool.
[08:18.930 --> 08:20.050]  I'd like to get out now.
[08:20.070 --> 08:20.830]  Thank you.
[08:26.410 --> 08:27.530]  I'm going to flank again.
[08:27.830 --> 08:28.630]  All right, here we go.
[08:29.310 --> 08:30.390]  Are you a flanker before?
[08:30.930 --> 08:34.550]  I was trying to, and I got halfway around him, and then you gave him advantage.
[08:37.470 --> 08:40.010]  Oh, I shot that guy's anus quite a lot by accident.
[08:40.090 --> 08:40.250]  Yeah.
[08:41.330 --> 08:42.450]  Get those guys on the left, Nick.
[08:42.590 --> 08:43.010]  You got him.
[08:44.070 --> 08:44.390]  Ow!
[08:45.130 --> 08:45.790]  Oh, shit.
[08:48.010 --> 08:49.550]  Oh, I didn't get points for killing that guy.
[08:49.890 --> 08:50.210]  Oh, shit.
[08:50.210 --> 08:50.530]  Oh.
[08:52.010 --> 08:53.070]  They're trying to retreat.
[08:53.890 --> 08:54.990]  Try and box them out.
[08:57.150 --> 08:57.530]  I didn't jump that.
[08:57.970 --> 08:59.750]  Eric just uncooled the shit out of me.
[09:00.070 --> 09:00.650]  Yeah, sorry.
[09:03.310 --> 09:03.690]  What?
[09:04.510 --> 09:05.070]  There we go.
[09:07.570 --> 09:11.390]  I took out the guy that was on that rooftop far out, like, in the distance.
[09:12.390 --> 09:13.770]  It was something that happened quite a lot of gears.
[09:14.530 --> 09:14.830]  Oh.
[09:16.230 --> 09:18.410]  Oh, God, what's that guy doing back there?
[09:18.790 --> 09:19.730]  Don't forget about cover.
[09:21.710 --> 09:22.570]  There's Andrew.
[09:22.710 --> 09:24.430]  Okay, so how do we get...
[09:24.430 --> 09:25.110]  This guy's up here.
[09:25.230 --> 09:25.350]  Ow!
[09:27.530 --> 09:28.710]  Okay, that guy...
[09:28.710 --> 09:29.550]  He's bouncing.
[09:30.390 --> 09:33.030]  Can I get a grenade up there?
[09:33.370 --> 09:36.210]  I think we just have to go up the stairs.
[09:37.050 --> 09:37.090]  There we go.
[09:37.110 --> 09:37.670]  Oh, my God.
[09:39.390 --> 09:39.990]  Hold on.
[09:40.230 --> 09:40.990]  I got it.
[09:41.030 --> 09:41.590]  I got it.
[09:41.590 --> 09:41.910]  Oh, okay.
[09:43.090 --> 09:43.450]  Uh-oh.
[09:47.050 --> 09:47.790]  Got him.
[09:48.230 --> 09:48.590]  Okay, cool.
[09:48.590 --> 09:49.190]  There we go.
[09:49.530 --> 09:50.050]  Alright, two more.
[09:50.050 --> 09:50.250]  Okay, he's dead.
[09:52.790 --> 09:53.410]  Got him.
[09:55.410 --> 09:56.050]  Okay, two more.
[09:56.730 --> 09:56.990]  Yep.
[09:58.730 --> 09:59.660]  Ooh, that guy...
[10:00.330 --> 10:00.790]  Nice.
[10:01.090 --> 10:01.250]  Died ninth.
[10:01.530 --> 10:01.830]  Cool.
[10:03.070 --> 10:05.090]  Wait for the transporter to get in the white van.
[10:05.330 --> 10:05.490]  Okay.
[10:12.200 --> 10:12.940]  I'm on it.
[10:13.100 --> 10:14.920]  We're gonna have to defend this location, aren't we?
[10:15.180 --> 10:16.260]  I would think so.
[10:16.800 --> 10:18.160]  I'm getting up on the roof.
[10:18.660 --> 10:18.960]  Nice.
[10:19.700 --> 10:22.240]  Oh, that's so much easier using the quickie.
[10:22.240 --> 10:23.400]  Oh, man, that's great.
[10:24.760 --> 10:25.840]  Up to eat a snack.
[10:26.480 --> 10:27.260]  Oh, that's phenomenal.
[10:27.840 --> 10:29.080]  I'm gonna close the back door.
[10:29.440 --> 10:30.740]  Just been playing it for 11 years, right?
[10:31.180 --> 10:32.360]  That hasn't always been there, has it?
[10:33.200 --> 10:33.560]  Probably.
[10:34.100 --> 10:34.800]  Oh, shit.
[10:35.740 --> 10:36.300]  What a schmuck.
[10:37.580 --> 10:39.220]  Wait for the white van to get in position.
[10:39.520 --> 10:39.720]  Okay.
[10:40.060 --> 10:40.780]  Hey, this car is locked.
[10:40.800 --> 10:41.160]  Here we go.
[10:42.400 --> 10:43.600]  Okay, white van is in position.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.860]  You think you're gonna notice a difference?
[10:47.180 --> 10:47.260]  Cool.
[10:47.400 --> 10:47.520]  Ah!
[10:50.660 --> 10:51.240]  Van swap.
[10:54.900 --> 10:57.220]  It's a real ambulance style, having a different color.
[10:57.580 --> 10:58.340]  Red to red, blue to blue.
[10:58.620 --> 10:58.980]  We got it.
[10:59.740 --> 11:03.060]  He pulled out the data cables, but there was no power cable in there.
[11:03.460 --> 11:03.620]  Yeah.
[11:03.720 --> 11:03.980]  No!
[11:04.580 --> 11:05.180]  I don't really understand.
[11:05.320 --> 11:07.540]  Now we're getting... we got cable for the whole neighborhood now.
[11:07.940 --> 11:09.680]  Wait for the server equipment to be moved.
[11:09.800 --> 11:10.860]  Get in the black van.
[11:10.940 --> 11:11.740]  Oh, get in the black van.
[11:11.880 --> 11:12.060]  Okay.
[11:12.880 --> 11:13.780]  I'm in the back!
[11:16.020 --> 11:16.680]  Alright, boys.
[11:17.820 --> 11:18.520]  Let's do it.
[11:19.900 --> 11:20.620]  Who's not...
[11:20.620 --> 11:23.200]  I'm waiting for the decoys to leave the area.
[11:23.680 --> 11:24.100]  Oh, okay.
[11:24.800 --> 11:25.860]  Andrew drives the...
[11:25.860 --> 11:26.700]  We're stealing it!
[11:26.880 --> 11:27.440]  We're nicking it!
[11:27.460 --> 11:28.100]  Look at us!
[11:28.380 --> 11:30.100]  Yeah, we got it, you little bastards!
[11:32.560 --> 11:33.000]  What?
[11:34.180 --> 11:35.080]  Take him out!
[11:35.620 --> 11:36.880]  I'm nicking the van!
[11:38.980 --> 11:40.140]  Still haven't left the area.
[11:40.380 --> 11:41.680]  Wait, don't drive in circles.
[11:42.160 --> 11:42.580]  There we go.
[11:44.360 --> 11:46.960]  I can't shoot out the front or the sides.
[11:47.700 --> 11:48.980]  You can't just hold your arm out?
[11:50.060 --> 11:50.820]  Apparently not.
[11:50.980 --> 11:51.940]  I can aim out the back.
[11:54.120 --> 11:55.000]  That makes sense.
[11:55.760 --> 11:55.960]  Hey!
[11:56.460 --> 11:56.680]  Hey!
[11:57.520 --> 11:57.900]  Stop.
[11:58.100 --> 11:59.100]  Don't just shoot random cars.
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.280]  We don't want cops on us.
[12:01.180 --> 12:03.320]  I mean, I think you're going to be honest regardless.
[12:05.920 --> 12:07.040]  How do I change weapons?
[12:07.240 --> 12:07.680]  Oh, okay.
[12:10.440 --> 12:10.840]  Wow.
[12:13.120 --> 12:16.780]  See, the heist music's amazing.
[12:17.780 --> 12:18.400]  I don't hear it.
[12:20.000 --> 12:20.560]  Just kidding.
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.120]  It's cool. I like it.
[12:22.220 --> 12:22.440]  It's fine.
[12:23.100 --> 12:24.840]  Have we been doing this without this this whole time?
[12:25.180 --> 12:25.280]  Yeah.
[12:26.200 --> 12:26.840]  What the...
[12:26.840 --> 12:27.320]  Holy shit.
[12:28.840 --> 12:29.520]  I'm going to be honest.
[12:29.660 --> 12:32.020]  I didn't notice there even was music, Gavin, until you said,
[12:32.160 --> 12:33.000]  Look, it's awesome.
[12:33.300 --> 12:33.480]  Yep.
[12:34.780 --> 12:36.180]  How do I...
[12:36.180 --> 12:37.060]  It makes you want to drive faster.
[12:37.060 --> 12:37.960]  ...access the weapon wheel in here?
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.240]  Just keep hitting B.
[12:39.360 --> 12:40.140]  No, keep hitting X.
[12:40.500 --> 12:41.580]  There's no wheel in the car.
[12:41.700 --> 12:42.120]  There's no wheel.
[12:42.240 --> 12:42.620]  You just scroll through.
[12:42.800 --> 12:43.920]  Yeah, you just scroll through the button.
[12:44.020 --> 12:44.780]  You just keep hitting X.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.260]  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[12:47.300 --> 12:48.320]  Oh, to like eat snacks.
[12:48.320 --> 12:48.660]  There.
[12:49.000 --> 12:49.340]  Okay.
[12:49.780 --> 12:49.920]  Yeah.
[12:51.120 --> 12:51.560]  Oh, shit.
[12:51.760 --> 12:52.320]  Oh, boy.
[12:52.440 --> 12:53.760]  That guy came out of nowhere, buddy.
[12:55.520 --> 12:58.080]  Nice relaxing drive to Lester's factory.
[12:59.580 --> 13:02.400]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[13:02.400 --> 13:02.920]  I'm dead.
[13:03.160 --> 13:03.560]  Oh, shit.
[13:03.860 --> 13:04.800]  Oh, Nick died?
[13:05.060 --> 13:05.620]  I got it.
[13:06.600 --> 13:07.360]  Oh, no.
[13:08.040 --> 13:08.440]  Delivered it.
[13:09.220 --> 13:09.860]  Nick died.
[13:10.500 --> 13:11.160]  I did.
[13:11.260 --> 13:12.760]  I got eviscerated in the back.
[13:12.820 --> 13:13.160]  You know what?
[13:13.940 --> 13:14.300]  What?
[13:14.460 --> 13:15.360]  We ain't got time for guns.
[13:16.560 --> 13:17.540]  You have time for death?
[13:17.540 --> 13:19.780]  He's going to use grenades.
[13:20.740 --> 13:21.700]  Some explosives?
[13:22.040 --> 13:22.180]  Yeah.
[13:22.580 --> 13:22.800]  Great.
[13:23.620 --> 13:23.760]  You know.
[13:25.620 --> 13:26.100]  Contraband.
[13:26.500 --> 13:26.940]  You know what I'm saying?
[13:28.560 --> 13:28.900]  What?
[13:29.680 --> 13:30.020]  What?
[13:31.840 --> 13:33.740]  He's talking about a Mark Wahlberg movie?
[13:34.260 --> 13:35.120]  It's going to blow us up.
[13:35.440 --> 13:35.960]  We're going to die.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.380]  I think it's a little bit early for Nick to be whispering shit.
[13:38.700 --> 13:39.640]  It really, like...
[13:39.640 --> 13:39.700]  What?
[13:40.080 --> 13:40.240]  No!
[13:40.240 --> 13:41.400]  It's usually at late game.
[13:41.880 --> 13:43.900]  We've only been together for half an hour?
[13:44.240 --> 13:44.400]  Yeah.
[13:44.400 --> 13:44.980]  Oh, boy.
[13:45.160 --> 13:45.680]  That's crazy.
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.240]  Oh, boy.
[13:46.420 --> 13:47.460]  Did you wake up early, Nick?
[13:48.300 --> 13:49.180]  Oh, I sure did.
[13:50.700 --> 13:52.960]  And I woke up on the bright side of it.
[13:53.020 --> 13:53.040]  Okay.
[13:53.440 --> 13:53.720]  Yeah!
[13:54.400 --> 13:55.220]  Let's get in the black van.
[13:55.780 --> 13:56.520]  Let's see.
[13:57.740 --> 13:58.600]  We'll start sticky.
[13:59.660 --> 14:00.280]  Sticky it is.
[14:04.700 --> 14:05.980]  I'm driving, I guess.
[14:07.100 --> 14:07.520]  You guys in?
[14:07.840 --> 14:08.700]  Let me get in the side.
[14:08.940 --> 14:09.720]  Get in!
[14:09.880 --> 14:11.240]  Get in the van!
[14:13.240 --> 14:17.280]  How do you blow up the sticky bombs?
[14:17.440 --> 14:18.620]  Just throw them.
[14:23.160 --> 14:24.440]  Andrew, that was funny.
[14:28.240 --> 14:29.720]  Left D-pad or something?
[14:31.240 --> 14:32.120]  Okay.
[14:33.860 --> 14:35.360]  Oh, you...
[14:35.360 --> 14:36.560]  Mine fell off.
[14:37.620 --> 14:38.160]  Shucks.
[14:39.260 --> 14:41.260]  I guess friendly fire's off.
[14:44.020 --> 14:44.820]  Got him!
[14:51.260 --> 14:53.700]  This guy's just shooting into our...
[14:54.560 --> 14:56.000]  That wasn't me!
[14:56.280 --> 14:57.280]  That wasn't me!
[14:58.300 --> 14:59.040]  Hey, Andrew.
[14:59.600 --> 14:59.800]  Yeah.
[15:00.160 --> 15:00.800]  That was Nick.
[15:02.460 --> 15:04.360]  I didn't detonate the bomb.
[15:04.440 --> 15:05.480]  I just threw it on there.
[15:07.100 --> 15:08.180]  Maybe a little bit.
[15:08.940 --> 15:09.960]  Why'd you shoot it, Gavin?
[15:10.580 --> 15:11.500]  I was in the back of the van.
[15:11.500 --> 15:12.480]  How could I have shot it?
[15:13.180 --> 15:14.000]  Eric shot it, then.
[15:14.280 --> 15:16.040]  I am driving the van.
[15:17.060 --> 15:18.160]  You got a gun, hand.
[15:21.920 --> 15:23.000]  I'll be more careful.
[15:27.980 --> 15:29.020]  Hey, look, we're learning.
[15:32.520 --> 15:33.480]  We're learning?
[15:34.080 --> 15:34.940]  Yeah, we're learning.
[15:36.140 --> 15:37.520]  Getting used to these sticky bombs.
[15:37.860 --> 15:38.440]  Andrew, you learning?
[15:38.880 --> 15:39.840]  Yeah, we're learning.
[15:41.160 --> 15:42.240]  Thought he was pretty clear.
[15:45.100 --> 15:46.840]  I got a hatchet.
[15:46.900 --> 15:48.540]  That'll work for us.
[15:49.140 --> 15:50.140]  Get me close.
[15:54.320 --> 15:55.980]  There goes the entire windshield.
[15:56.760 --> 15:57.640]  Who needs it?
[15:58.680 --> 15:59.680]  I want to feel the breeze.
[16:00.240 --> 16:01.100]  We can't go this way!
[16:01.100 --> 16:02.520]  Wow, those are some strong boxes.
[16:02.520 --> 16:03.060]  No kidding.
[16:03.480 --> 16:04.080]  Real strong.
[16:05.260 --> 16:05.920]  Hang on.
[16:06.140 --> 16:06.620]  Traffic jam.
[16:06.700 --> 16:07.780]  Oh, that's not good.
[16:09.660 --> 16:10.280]  What's that beeping?
[16:10.660 --> 16:10.940]  I don't know.
[16:13.880 --> 16:15.100]  You're the guy who's holding explosives.
[16:15.600 --> 16:16.200]  See, look at that.
[16:16.200 --> 16:17.000]  Did you see that?
[16:17.200 --> 16:17.880]  That was good.
[16:18.140 --> 16:18.900]  Look at that.
[16:18.940 --> 16:20.280]  What the fuck is this car?
[16:22.840 --> 16:23.760]  Alright, I'll watch forward.
[16:28.520 --> 16:29.620]  We got it.
[16:29.680 --> 16:33.140]  Oh my god.
[16:34.020 --> 16:35.480]  Just some random person.
[16:35.760 --> 16:35.960]  Yeah.
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.080]  No, that was them.
[16:37.480 --> 16:38.140]  That was them?
[16:38.680 --> 16:39.420]  I think so.
[16:39.820 --> 16:40.760]  Oh, fuck me.
[16:41.000 --> 16:41.920]  That was close.
[16:43.140 --> 16:46.920]  I can hear all the explosions from like six blocks away.
[16:47.600 --> 16:48.720]  It's a lot of explosions.
[16:48.720 --> 16:51.660]  I mean, it's a lot of explosions.
[16:52.680 --> 16:53.040]  Yeah!
[16:55.100 --> 16:56.120]  That's for you, madam.
[16:57.940 --> 16:58.980]  What the fuck?
[16:59.020 --> 17:00.360]  That was really close.
[17:03.980 --> 17:05.060]  There we go.
[17:06.480 --> 17:07.500]  Alright, eyes on the road.
[17:07.580 --> 17:07.960]  We're good here.
[17:08.040 --> 17:08.260]  Got him!
[17:10.660 --> 17:11.900]  Alright, here comes a left.
[17:13.680 --> 17:16.620]  I am almost at Lester's factory.
[17:17.060 --> 17:18.080]  You get to live for now, buddy.
[17:18.080 --> 17:18.820]  There we go.
[17:19.180 --> 17:19.720]  Got him!
[17:20.860 --> 17:21.300]  Left.
[17:21.800 --> 17:22.640]  That's for you.
[17:22.880 --> 17:24.320]  Oh my god, that one was close.
[17:24.920 --> 17:31.640]  When I start making the turns and the explosions happens, and it just shakes the whole screen, it's like, oh, I don't know about this.
[17:34.200 --> 17:34.540]  Kay.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.860]  I'm having a great time.
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.020]  Uh-oh!
[17:39.640 --> 17:41.080]  You're not really missing, which is good.
[17:41.880 --> 17:43.880]  Yeah, so far, so good.
[17:45.860 --> 17:46.200]  That's for you.
[17:46.200 --> 17:48.920]  That was a cutscene, and I was about to ask if you guys are, but that was Andrew.
[17:48.920 --> 17:50.300]  No, no, we're almost there.
[17:52.080 --> 17:53.860]  Oh, you got to destroy the black man now.
[17:54.380 --> 17:54.740]  Oh.
[17:55.000 --> 17:55.300]  Do we?
[17:55.520 --> 17:56.760]  Hey, I got just the thing.
[18:00.160 --> 18:00.520]  Cool.
[18:02.460 --> 18:03.200]  Get me out!
[18:03.300 --> 18:04.000]  Oh my god.
[18:05.160 --> 18:05.880]  Oh god.
[18:06.640 --> 18:07.540]  God damn it!
[18:07.980 --> 18:08.340]  Wait!
[18:08.820 --> 18:09.800]  Oh, you went away from it.
[18:11.000 --> 18:11.360]  Of course.
[18:13.400 --> 18:13.920]  Are we doing it?
[18:13.940 --> 18:14.660]  Oh, Jesus.
[18:14.660 --> 18:15.360]  Yeah!
[18:18.420 --> 18:19.280]  Oh, Bladnum!
[18:19.540 --> 18:22.180]  Towards me, Nick ran to the right, so I was like, okay, good.
[18:22.300 --> 18:25.180]  And then Nick came back and started running towards me.
[18:25.620 --> 18:26.820]  There was a dead end over there.
[18:32.920 --> 18:33.760]  Oh, hell yeah.
[18:33.860 --> 18:33.980]  Hey!
[18:34.140 --> 18:34.460]  Smoking.
[18:35.580 --> 18:35.980]  Cross like.
[18:36.000 --> 18:36.440]  Great driving.
[18:37.900 --> 18:40.700]  And I believe Eric should be Ratman.
[18:41.300 --> 18:41.720]  Really?
[18:41.960 --> 18:42.820]  I think so.
[18:43.100 --> 18:43.540]  Ratman!
[18:43.540 --> 18:44.540]  I get...
[18:45.160 --> 18:45.800]  Come on.
[18:49.180 --> 18:50.580]  Oh, it took away your mask.
[18:50.780 --> 18:51.520]  Oh, no, it's there.
[18:51.720 --> 18:52.320]  Oh, there it is.
[18:52.360 --> 18:53.020]  Wow, it popped on.
[18:53.320 --> 18:53.640]  Wow!
[18:57.560 --> 18:58.520]  I'm fucking stoked.
[18:58.580 --> 18:59.940]  Why do I get to be the rat?
[19:00.020 --> 19:00.560]  This is great.
[19:00.800 --> 19:01.300]  I'm so excited.
[19:01.800 --> 19:03.260]  I noticed it was a setting I could turn on.
[19:04.040 --> 19:04.360]  What?
[19:04.900 --> 19:05.340]  I can just flip it.
[19:05.340 --> 19:05.940]  That was also in the comments.
[19:06.480 --> 19:10.460]  We've played the whole time and I could have been in the mask and you just turned it off?
[19:10.880 --> 19:11.920]  I didn't turn it off.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.180]  I just didn't turn it on.
[19:13.180 --> 19:14.020]  It was already on.
[19:14.020 --> 19:14.520]  Always have it on.
[19:14.660 --> 19:16.300]  Why is it off now?
[19:17.440 --> 19:18.080]  I don't know.
[19:19.500 --> 19:20.880]  Who wants in the armored car?
[19:21.100 --> 19:21.420]  Me.
[19:22.840 --> 19:23.940]  This is a mistake.
[19:24.960 --> 19:25.920]  Oh, dear.
[19:26.800 --> 19:27.700]  Run, rabbit, run.
[19:29.060 --> 19:30.340]  Hey, I don't have pedals.
[19:30.500 --> 19:31.780]  You can't do that to me.
[19:35.240 --> 19:36.280]  Oh, shit!
[19:37.140 --> 19:38.500]  I took myself out.
[19:41.160 --> 19:42.320]  Oh, fuck me.
[19:42.920 --> 19:43.360]  Okay.
[19:43.980 --> 19:44.860]  Jesus Christ.
[19:45.500 --> 19:47.400]  I spent money on armor.
[19:47.540 --> 19:48.480]  You fucks.
[19:49.320 --> 19:50.580]  It's all gone.
[19:50.660 --> 19:52.420]  I wasn't even on a bike that time, dickhead.
[19:52.420 --> 19:52.720]  I just don't understand.
[19:52.980 --> 19:53.860]  You know the rules.
[19:54.100 --> 19:54.880]  Yeah, you know the rules of the road.
[19:54.880 --> 19:56.120]  But I wasn't even on a bike.
[19:56.660 --> 19:57.420]  It's the worst.
[19:57.540 --> 19:58.140]  It's a scooter.
[19:58.740 --> 19:59.860]  Gavin, did you take my car again?
[19:59.860 --> 20:03.620]  You ran me over when I was laying down in the middle of the road.
[20:03.820 --> 20:05.560]  There was zero bike involved.
[20:07.860 --> 20:08.740]  Holy shit.
[20:09.540 --> 20:10.100]  That was cool.
[20:14.220 --> 20:15.060]  Oh, man.
[20:17.260 --> 20:18.900]  So this car is upgraded now.
[20:20.480 --> 20:22.920]  Wish I could drop an airstrike on that car right now.
[20:24.700 --> 20:25.520]  You can.
[20:26.360 --> 20:26.840]  Yeah, you could.
[20:27.080 --> 20:27.200]  What?
[20:28.780 --> 20:29.800]  Call Lester.
[20:30.520 --> 20:32.280]  Nick's really excited to agree.
[20:34.120 --> 20:34.600]  Yeah.
[20:35.660 --> 20:36.640]  What are we talking about?
[20:37.720 --> 20:39.120]  I'm having a real Gracie moment.
[20:45.540 --> 20:51.800]  We took her out to eat and Michael was talking about, like, what he'd been eating or whatever when he started working out.
[20:52.120 --> 20:54.100]  And he's like, now it's, you know, I work out all the time.
[20:54.180 --> 20:55.100]  I can just eat whatever I want.
[20:55.160 --> 20:56.060]  I can just do whatever I want.
[20:56.120 --> 20:58.000]  And Gracie started going, yeah, do whatever you want.
[20:58.060 --> 20:58.900]  What are you talking about?
[21:04.080 --> 21:04.820]  What a freak.
[21:05.520 --> 21:07.320]  She is full on freak mode.
[21:07.980 --> 21:10.420]  When she gets into play mode, it's like, it's nuts.
[21:10.620 --> 21:11.440]  That's all she calls it.
[21:11.520 --> 21:12.920]  She's like, I'm in play mode.
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.240]  And it's like, she's nuts.
[21:14.240 --> 21:14.600]  Yeah.
[21:14.740 --> 21:17.980]  She has to decompress in her car and get into play mode before an episode.
[21:18.740 --> 21:19.800]  It's so nuts.
[21:22.580 --> 21:24.060]  I got my rat mask back on.
[21:24.640 --> 21:25.100]  Oh, you do?
[21:25.280 --> 21:25.440]  Yeah.
[21:26.080 --> 21:28.300]  I had to take off an earpiece and put on a mask.
[21:28.320 --> 21:28.940]  It was such a headache.
[21:31.180 --> 21:32.480]  Yeah, you don't need to hear Lester.
[21:32.920 --> 21:33.960]  I don't give a fuck.
[21:34.600 --> 21:35.000]  That's right.
[21:35.120 --> 21:35.920]  I'm the rat man.
[21:36.080 --> 21:36.840]  Tell me what to shoot.
[21:36.980 --> 21:37.880]  I'm da rat.
[21:40.000 --> 21:40.360]  Okay.
[21:40.540 --> 21:40.860]  Excuse me.
[21:41.120 --> 21:41.340]  Okay.
[21:42.140 --> 21:43.200]  How's all that armor, Andrew?
[21:44.800 --> 21:45.160]  Great.
[21:46.720 --> 21:50.560]  I guess if you think of it in the sense of I would have died without it, it was pretty good.
[21:51.120 --> 21:52.320]  Yeah, it wasn't a waste.
[21:52.880 --> 21:54.740]  Yeah, but also I don't think that's how armor works.
[21:56.420 --> 21:56.980]  Yeah, tell him, Nick.
[21:57.600 --> 21:58.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:00.640 --> 22:02.920]  Put on a bulletproof vest and then we'll hit you with a car.
[22:03.180 --> 22:03.760]  We'll hit you with a car.
[22:04.600 --> 22:07.200]  Why do American football players wear it then?
[22:08.560 --> 22:09.800]  What, bulletproof vests?
[22:10.360 --> 22:10.700]  Yeah.
[22:11.920 --> 22:12.820]  Okay, well that's different.
[22:14.480 --> 22:17.700]  Do you think a bulletproof vest is a football pads?
[22:19.620 --> 22:20.920]  That's a similar category.
[22:20.920 --> 22:24.420]  I just want to see a full NFL team wearing Knights armor.
[22:25.060 --> 22:27.960]  Dude, I want to see them all just wearing Kevlar.
[22:28.120 --> 22:30.200]  It'd be the slowest game of football you've ever seen.
[22:33.360 --> 22:34.180]  Oh, Nick.
[22:34.380 --> 22:35.880]  Not again, not again.
[22:36.700 --> 22:41.060]  Rewatching the heist where Nick drives into the water, outrageous.
[22:42.700 --> 22:44.220]  Holy shit, Gavin.
[22:50.020 --> 22:51.940]  That was crazy.
[22:52.320 --> 22:55.320]  I thought I was going into the water, but I landed on the lap.
[22:56.000 --> 23:02.040]  I turned the corner and I just see a car going to the moon. It was flying. You're in space.
[23:02.600 --> 23:03.080]  Incredible.
[23:03.560 --> 23:06.960]  Oh, it was so close. I did it again.
[23:08.400 --> 23:17.460]  You know what else was crazy? I was watching one of the old heists back, and when we were doing the one where we steal the jets, we're all at night and Andrew's in the day for some reason.
[23:17.940 --> 23:18.100]  Really?
[23:18.180 --> 23:20.280]  The game's not good.
[23:29.030 --> 23:29.930]  Andrew, you want in?
[23:30.250 --> 23:30.830]  I'm good.
[23:31.830 --> 23:32.470]  Actually, yeah.
[23:36.250 --> 23:37.090]  Very safe.
[23:37.350 --> 23:38.050]  The rat shoved over.
[23:38.050 --> 23:38.610]  Very safe.
[23:38.990 --> 23:39.850]  Oh, a woman.
[23:40.410 --> 23:41.210]  Oh, dear.
[23:42.850 --> 23:43.590]  Sorry, lady.
[23:44.450 --> 23:46.310]  Hey, Andrew, if you go into first-person mode, do I look cool?
[23:47.230 --> 23:47.970]  How do I do that again?
[23:48.610 --> 23:49.530]  Just keep hitting...
[23:49.530 --> 23:49.650]  Oh, yeah.
[23:49.730 --> 23:55.030]  Oh, you look so cool. You got big eyes. Oh, that's great. You got whiskers.
[23:57.050 --> 23:57.450]  Sick.
[23:58.510 --> 23:59.810]  Big eyes and whiskers.
[24:01.230 --> 24:01.910]  Oh, Gavin.
[24:02.750 --> 24:03.590]  You're halfway to furry.
[24:04.170 --> 24:04.990]  Gavin's holding a gun.
[24:06.670 --> 24:06.970]  What's up?
[24:06.970 --> 24:07.550]  What kind of gun?
[24:09.610 --> 24:12.270]  I think there are too many... Are you in first-person, Eric?
[24:12.370 --> 24:12.750]  I am.
[24:12.950 --> 24:13.130]  Yeah.
[24:13.430 --> 24:17.110]  Too many switches for not enough vents for this air conditioner.
[24:17.250 --> 24:17.770]  Oh, I agree.
[24:17.830 --> 24:18.690]  There's three of them.
[24:19.370 --> 24:22.890]  There's like vents, tiny, tiny, tiny vents in the middle.
[24:23.130 --> 24:25.050]  No radio or is the radio lower?
[24:25.750 --> 24:26.010]  Uh-oh.
[24:27.190 --> 24:27.750]  Oh, Nick.
[24:28.350 --> 24:29.170]  Oh, my God.
[24:31.130 --> 24:32.790]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[24:33.630 --> 24:36.090]  Watching this happen in first-person is crazy.
[24:36.970 --> 24:38.410]  Did that make you sick? You guys okay?
[24:40.010 --> 24:40.770]  Oh, God.
[24:43.050 --> 24:44.510]  How do I look, Gavin? Do I look cool?
[24:45.590 --> 24:47.210]  Am I looking at you with a gun?
[24:47.630 --> 24:49.330]  Yeah. Yeah. You look all nuts, though.
[24:49.850 --> 24:50.070]  Oh.
[24:50.710 --> 24:54.020]  You look like... It looks like you're kind of like crouching and going...
[24:56.610 --> 24:57.350]  In the front seat.
[24:57.350 --> 24:58.510]  You're going up by your chin.
[24:58.870 --> 24:59.270]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:59.390 --> 25:02.870]  Yeah, yours is covering your eyes like you're trying to hide something.
[25:03.590 --> 25:04.350]  Oh, Nick.
[25:05.110 --> 25:06.790]  I just see the sky out of every window.
[25:06.790 --> 25:06.950]  Yeah.
[25:08.750 --> 25:12.250]  All of a sudden, the gun goes, like, real floaty when we're in the air.
[25:12.470 --> 25:13.470]  It's like, oh, you're in zero-G.
[25:14.630 --> 25:16.350]  Yeah, man. Bomb a comet. Here we go.
[25:16.610 --> 25:18.650]  Oh, we were briefly all touching our guns together, then.
[25:18.930 --> 25:20.290]  Oh, can we do that? Hang on.
[25:24.650 --> 25:25.570]  Nick, where's your gun?
[25:27.750 --> 25:29.450]  Don't ask Nick to do anything but drive.
[25:29.590 --> 25:30.550]  Oh, my God.
[25:30.990 --> 25:31.870]  Oh, my God.
[25:38.030 --> 25:39.290]  Was it cool? Did it look cool?
[25:39.470 --> 25:39.910]  It looked really cool.
[25:39.930 --> 25:40.950]  Yeah, really cool.
[25:43.350 --> 25:45.950]  Being inside in first person and just firing the gun.
[25:54.690 --> 25:56.590]  All right, Nick. We're here. We did it.
[25:56.730 --> 25:57.450]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:58.430 --> 25:58.750]  Okay.
[25:59.970 --> 26:02.410]  Go to the ambush point. Wait for the convoy.
[26:02.570 --> 26:03.950]  Oh, God. I'm still in first person. There we go.
[26:03.970 --> 26:04.450]  What do we do?
[26:05.230 --> 26:06.630]  Wait for the convoy, I guess.
[26:08.530 --> 26:09.410]  I'll take the chopper.
[26:10.690 --> 26:11.930]  What the fuck?
[26:12.790 --> 26:14.030]  Oh, my God, Andrew.
[26:15.710 --> 26:16.990]  Are you trapping the bridge?
[26:18.330 --> 26:19.150]  He is.
[26:19.990 --> 26:21.390]  He's just going to blow the bridge.
[26:24.860 --> 26:25.800]  That's a good idea.
[26:27.320 --> 26:28.240]  That went off the side.
[26:28.740 --> 26:29.220]  It did.
[26:30.660 --> 26:31.400]  Oh, nobody's fishing.
[26:35.780 --> 26:36.920]  Go to the location.
[26:37.280 --> 26:38.800]  Ow, that hit me in the chest.
[26:39.100 --> 26:39.620]  Go to the what?
[26:40.660 --> 26:41.820]  Just go to the location.
[26:41.820 --> 26:43.420]  Are we supposed to stay in the car?
[26:43.980 --> 26:45.080]  I'm just... I gotta wait for the convoy.
[26:45.080 --> 26:47.040]  No, mine just says wait for the convoy.
[26:47.800 --> 26:49.780]  Oh, it says go to the location.
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.080]  I don't...
[26:51.080 --> 26:52.780]  Maybe you're supposed to go somewhere else. Maybe we're in teams.
[26:52.780 --> 26:53.340]  Here's the convoy.
[26:54.560 --> 26:56.540]  I don't think we're in teams. It was all of us together.
[26:57.340 --> 26:58.400]  I'm going to hide behind this rock.
[26:58.820 --> 27:00.560]  How do I blow the C4 again?
[27:01.200 --> 27:01.740]  Left of the...
[27:01.740 --> 27:02.520]  Left of the view pad.
[27:03.400 --> 27:04.680]  Wait a minute. Hold on.
[27:05.100 --> 27:07.660]  Just don't stand on top of the one that's going to explode and you'll be fine.
[27:09.840 --> 27:10.840]  That's for you.
[27:12.920 --> 27:14.420]  Oh, you almost hit it.
[27:14.420 --> 27:15.300]  Oh, you did?
[27:15.560 --> 27:16.880]  Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
[27:16.960 --> 27:18.420]  Well, they're homing, to be fair.
[27:18.540 --> 27:19.020]  Oh.
[27:19.660 --> 27:20.660]  All right, you ready?
[27:21.140 --> 27:23.640]  Oh, it's still alive. Oh, he's pissed.
[27:24.000 --> 27:24.960]  He's really pissed.
[27:25.700 --> 27:26.260]  Away.
[27:27.780 --> 27:29.280]  I don't think we did it right.
[27:30.820 --> 27:31.380]  Oh.
[27:33.560 --> 27:35.220]  Don't destroy the truck.
[27:35.220 --> 27:35.640]  Oh.
[27:38.180 --> 27:38.700]  Oh.
[27:41.480 --> 27:42.220]  Oh, no.
[27:42.600 --> 27:45.080]  Well, certainly, it'll checkpoint us there.
[27:45.540 --> 27:47.840]  I'd apologize, but I don't have anything to be sorry for.
[27:49.300 --> 27:50.220]  Yeah, me too.
[27:50.980 --> 27:54.440]  So, we are just taking out the helicopter and not...
[27:55.400 --> 27:56.540]  and not anything else?
[27:56.540 --> 27:56.840]  Not the truck.
[27:57.260 --> 28:01.660]  So, should we park the car in front of, like, the...
[28:01.660 --> 28:03.580]  Yeah! Progress.
[28:04.080 --> 28:05.520]  Oh, I don't know that we have the car anymore.
[28:05.660 --> 28:06.920]  So, are we just stealing the truck?
[28:07.500 --> 28:08.160]  I think so.
[28:12.050 --> 28:12.530]  All right.
[28:12.690 --> 28:13.190]  I got a plan.
[28:14.370 --> 28:14.810]  Oh, okay.
[28:14.850 --> 28:15.850]  Oh, we got multiple cars.
[28:16.010 --> 28:16.390]  Oh, cool.
[28:16.990 --> 28:18.770]  Should we block the...
[28:18.770 --> 28:19.490]  Block it with yours.
[28:20.450 --> 28:21.330]  But not with yours?
[28:21.810 --> 28:22.610]  No, mine's armored.
[28:23.370 --> 28:24.410]  We can hide behind it.
[28:25.750 --> 28:26.350]  Yeah, I'll move it closer.
[28:26.370 --> 28:27.170]  Oh, go to the ambush point.
[28:27.330 --> 28:28.730]  Wait for your team to reach the ambush point.
[28:28.790 --> 28:30.050]  Right, right. That's where we are now.
[28:30.270 --> 28:30.410]  Okay.
[28:30.590 --> 28:31.890]  And then I'll put the car...
[28:31.890 --> 28:32.630]  Wasn't in a bike.
[28:32.630 --> 28:33.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:33.390 --> 28:35.250]  You just gotta block it sideways style.
[28:35.350 --> 28:35.670]  That's it.
[28:36.650 --> 28:36.750]  Here.
[28:36.870 --> 28:37.710]  And I'll put ours...
[28:37.710 --> 28:40.170]  Mine here so we can use it for cover purposes.
[28:40.390 --> 28:40.530]  Okay.
[28:40.530 --> 28:41.650]  And then peel out when we're done.
[28:41.950 --> 28:42.230]  Cool.
[28:43.530 --> 28:44.650]  Andrew's attacking the bridge.
[28:45.150 --> 28:45.350]  Yeah.
[28:45.430 --> 28:47.570]  I was trying to climb up it so I could drop from the ceiling.
[28:49.650 --> 28:50.430]  Oh, no! A truck!
[28:50.770 --> 28:51.610]  It's okay. He's fine.
[28:53.690 --> 28:54.930]  According to Nick, he's not fine.
[28:57.230 --> 28:58.190]  You're doing it Nick style.
[28:58.190 --> 28:59.690]  Look, he's blocking the bridge for us on the other side.
[29:00.430 --> 29:01.090]  Is that good?
[29:02.410 --> 29:02.850]  Yeah.
[29:03.070 --> 29:03.510]  Okay.
[29:04.130 --> 29:04.790]  It is now.
[29:04.910 --> 29:06.790]  Okay, I see the helicopter incoming.
[29:08.450 --> 29:09.510]  It's so far away.
[29:09.830 --> 29:10.270]  It is.
[29:10.330 --> 29:11.630]  Which truck is the truck?
[29:12.550 --> 29:14.330]  The... oh, I don't... how many were there?
[29:16.610 --> 29:17.030]  I didn't see.
[29:17.030 --> 29:17.890]  Maybe the other ones will pick up.
[29:19.730 --> 29:23.030]  I only... I was paying attention to the helicopter, so I didn't see anything else.
[29:23.770 --> 29:24.470]  The truck guy lived.
[29:28.290 --> 29:30.230]  Okay, who's taking out the helicopter?
[29:30.230 --> 29:31.370]  I got it.
[29:31.410 --> 29:34.210]  Okay, so the rest of us will focus on everything else, I guess.
[29:34.730 --> 29:35.630]  I got a plan.
[29:36.410 --> 29:37.370]  Oh, God.
[29:37.490 --> 29:38.430]  Oh, Andrew.
[29:42.070 --> 29:42.630]  Well...
[29:43.750 --> 29:45.050]  Rockets cost money, Andrew.
[29:46.950 --> 29:47.790]  Oh, God.
[29:48.790 --> 29:49.550]  He got... okay.
[29:49.970 --> 29:50.690]  He's dead.
[29:50.970 --> 29:51.770]  What happened?
[29:52.650 --> 29:53.550]  Who did that?
[29:54.130 --> 29:55.390]  The truck was destroyed?
[29:55.950 --> 29:56.710]  Who did that?
[29:57.290 --> 29:58.570]  Andrew, what did you do?
[29:58.750 --> 29:59.870]  I didn't do anything.
[29:59.870 --> 30:00.750]  Who did that?
[30:01.010 --> 30:02.090]  Did you blow the truck up?
[30:02.090 --> 30:03.550]  I shot... I shot the chopper.
[30:04.050 --> 30:05.710]  It landed on the truck.
[30:07.550 --> 30:08.010]  Really?
[30:12.210 --> 30:12.670]  Yes.
[30:13.610 --> 30:16.590]  I was trying to hop in the back of it as it was driving by.
[30:16.690 --> 30:19.290]  I didn't do anything to it, and then everything exploded.
[30:20.530 --> 30:21.550]  What a shot.
[30:25.990 --> 30:26.850]  That's incredible.
[30:27.210 --> 30:28.230]  That was insane.
[30:28.750 --> 30:29.610]  I think that was awesome.
[30:29.930 --> 30:30.970]  I thought it was a direct hit.
[30:30.970 --> 30:31.190]  I'm glad you threw him up there.
[30:37.310 --> 30:38.350]  Holy shit.
[30:40.870 --> 30:41.390]  Wow.
[30:42.750 --> 30:44.590]  All right, we have to go to the ambush point.
[30:44.870 --> 30:46.330]  I was going to be like, oh, I'll just stay right here.
[30:46.670 --> 30:47.110]  Nope.
[30:50.760 --> 30:52.500]  Oh, Jesus Christ, guys.
[30:57.060 --> 30:59.340]  What the fuck happened to you?
[30:59.700 --> 31:00.740]  What did you do to my car?
[31:01.220 --> 31:02.680]  Did you see that, Gavin?
[31:02.680 --> 31:05.380]  Gavin, drive up here.
[31:05.380 --> 31:05.480]  Who was that?
[31:05.820 --> 31:06.760]  Nick, drive back up here.
[31:06.820 --> 31:07.200]  What are you doing?
[31:07.280 --> 31:08.220]  My car's dead.
[31:09.060 --> 31:09.460]  Gavin.
[31:09.920 --> 31:10.160]  What?
[31:10.820 --> 31:11.420]  Did you see?
[31:11.500 --> 31:12.600]  How did you do that?
[31:12.880 --> 31:14.320]  I just got crushed by this car.
[31:14.360 --> 31:14.920]  What did I do?
[31:15.240 --> 31:19.080]  On my screen, you got flung out of the passenger seat,
[31:19.220 --> 31:20.920]  and your head hit the side of the bridge,
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.980]  and there's a giant blood stain on the beam.
[31:24.200 --> 31:25.140]  You dinged it.
[31:25.400 --> 31:26.040]  That's awesome.
[31:26.460 --> 31:27.340]  They got to show...
[31:28.580 --> 31:29.580]  Editor, make sure.
[31:30.960 --> 31:31.600]  Oh, shit.
[31:32.680 --> 31:34.160]  All our cars are done.
[31:37.100 --> 31:38.940]  We disabled all of our vehicles.
[31:44.920 --> 31:46.000]  Eric, are you okay?
[31:46.280 --> 31:46.880]  Yeah, I'm coming.
[31:48.560 --> 31:49.520]  Were you just coaxing them?
[31:49.960 --> 31:50.720]  Oh, shit.
[31:51.740 --> 31:53.100]  Oh, he fell off the bridge.
[31:53.360 --> 31:53.940]  That's what you think.
[31:54.520 --> 31:55.360]  Oh, okay, you made it.
[31:55.940 --> 31:58.100]  Oh, Christ.
[31:58.800 --> 31:59.780]  Oh, that was incredible.
[32:00.800 --> 32:03.780]  Okay, so how do we blow this thing up without destroying the truck?
[32:04.060 --> 32:04.620]  Do we wait?
[32:05.760 --> 32:08.000]  I'm going to snipe the driver in the truck.
[32:08.880 --> 32:09.260]  Okay.
[32:11.480 --> 32:15.650]  Okay, there goes...
[32:18.850 --> 32:19.230]  Fuck!
[32:19.310 --> 32:19.630]  What happened?
[32:19.650 --> 32:20.610]  I died instantly.
[32:20.730 --> 32:21.770]  We all died.
[32:22.390 --> 32:23.150]  What happened?
[32:25.790 --> 32:26.950]  Nick, did you kill yourself?
[32:27.610 --> 32:27.990]  No.
[32:28.370 --> 32:29.250]  How did we all...
[32:29.250 --> 32:30.250]  Dude, I was not close.
[32:30.290 --> 32:31.050]  I was in the scope.
[32:31.570 --> 32:34.150]  I was not close to you guys, and I died.
[32:34.210 --> 32:34.750]  I don't know what happened.
[32:34.750 --> 32:35.130]  I died too.
[32:35.130 --> 32:35.990]  Did we all die?
[32:36.210 --> 32:36.610]  Yeah.
[32:36.610 --> 32:37.110]  We did.
[32:37.190 --> 32:41.230]  I will say, I feel like I was looking at a rocket flying into the vehicle.
[32:41.450 --> 32:42.850]  We're not supposed to explode.
[32:43.250 --> 32:44.330]  Let's go to the cars.
[32:44.590 --> 32:45.050]  Back them.
[32:45.410 --> 32:46.030]  Behind them.
[32:46.170 --> 32:46.570]  Back them?
[32:46.690 --> 32:46.790]  What?
[32:50.970 --> 32:52.130]  I haven't had coffee today.
[32:52.210 --> 32:53.190]  Maybe that's the problem.
[32:53.590 --> 32:54.430]  It's definitely the problem.
[32:54.430 --> 32:54.530]  I need more.
[32:55.790 --> 32:58.290]  I don't think this is supposed to be hard, this part.
[32:58.730 --> 32:59.650]  I don't think so either.
[32:59.830 --> 33:01.170]  I think we're attacking too early.
[33:01.610 --> 33:02.430]  I think we just have to wait.
[33:02.590 --> 33:04.150]  But also, I'm so impatient.
[33:04.150 --> 33:07.090]  I want to get cars and go after them now.
[33:07.610 --> 33:08.670]  Where are the cars?
[33:09.090 --> 33:09.570]  They're gone.
[33:10.110 --> 33:10.310]  Good.
[33:10.950 --> 33:12.310]  Now they're punishing us.
[33:13.510 --> 33:16.870]  Your personal vehicle has been destroyed.
[33:17.290 --> 33:17.630]  Oh no.
[33:19.010 --> 33:20.770]  We have to go to the ambush point.
[33:20.930 --> 33:21.350]  There we go.
[33:23.310 --> 33:24.530]  I got us a car.
[33:24.870 --> 33:26.010]  Okay, so we don't have it.
[33:26.330 --> 33:28.790]  We're not going to the ambush point, so it's not going to start anything.
[33:28.950 --> 33:29.610]  Is that what we're doing?
[33:30.070 --> 33:30.470]  I'm coming.
[33:30.890 --> 33:31.710]  I went to the ambush point.
[33:32.330 --> 33:33.210]  No, you got to wait there.
[33:33.210 --> 33:34.790]  You got to go there properly.
[33:37.190 --> 33:38.170]  That was good.
[33:38.790 --> 33:39.510]  That was proper.
[33:40.170 --> 33:41.030]  Now we're good.
[33:41.070 --> 33:41.690]  Now you can go wherever.
[33:41.910 --> 33:42.450]  Wait for the car.
[33:42.850 --> 33:43.310]  All right.
[33:44.450 --> 33:45.070]  Oh, cool.
[33:46.390 --> 33:47.090]  Another one?
[33:47.130 --> 33:48.050]  Let's go have a look at it.
[33:48.330 --> 33:48.570]  Go.
[33:48.790 --> 33:49.510]  Go for it.
[33:49.790 --> 33:50.650]  I'll be back here.
[33:53.730 --> 33:55.350]  I just want to scout ahead to take a look.
[33:55.790 --> 33:56.510]  Do whatever you want.
[33:57.730 --> 33:59.210]  Well, not whatever you want, but...
[33:59.790 --> 34:01.410]  I mean, that's the way this has been going anyway.
[34:01.510 --> 34:02.110]  Do whatever you want.
[34:02.590 --> 34:02.950]  Okay.
[34:03.670 --> 34:05.030]  Just want to take a look over the hill.
[34:05.130 --> 34:06.330]  I've got my little cover down.
[34:06.830 --> 34:07.450]  I see that.
[34:07.590 --> 34:08.470]  No one's getting you.
[34:08.730 --> 34:09.150]  How do I look?
[34:09.310 --> 34:09.670]  Convoy's coming.
[34:10.290 --> 34:12.590]  I'm going to hide behind the rock, see if that helps.
[34:12.830 --> 34:13.770]  I'm going to join the convoy.
[34:14.190 --> 34:14.490]  Okay.
[34:14.570 --> 34:15.730]  So they really don't expect me.
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.600]  Oh, I should Trojan horse that guy.
[34:25.150 --> 34:25.450]  Where's the helicopter?
[34:25.450 --> 34:27.050]  I'm going to throw a sticky bomb on that truck.
[34:27.070 --> 34:27.530]  No, there it is.
[34:28.250 --> 34:30.470]  Why would you sticky bomb the truck?
[34:33.750 --> 34:35.010]  And now you answer.
[34:35.010 --> 34:36.090]  Now they're all mad.
[34:36.190 --> 34:36.730]  Hold on, sorry.
[34:36.850 --> 34:37.710]  Sorry, sorry, they're mad.
[34:37.750 --> 34:38.310]  I didn't do anything.
[34:38.450 --> 34:39.270]  I didn't do anything that time.
[34:39.350 --> 34:40.530]  Wait, there's a sticky bomb on the truck?
[34:41.050 --> 34:41.910]  Not on the truck.
[34:42.090 --> 34:44.450]  I didn't do anything that time.
[34:47.170 --> 34:47.970]  Chopper's getting low.
[34:48.590 --> 34:52.110]  I see comments that are like, oh yeah, Eric just repeats the things that were just said by people.
[34:52.410 --> 34:55.890]  It's because the shit that's said is so outrageous, I don't know what else to do.
[34:56.210 --> 34:57.950]  How did that happen so fast?
[34:58.070 --> 34:59.490]  Now my car's been destroyed.
[34:59.570 --> 35:00.550]  Who blew up my car?
[35:01.970 --> 35:02.690]  That was Nick.
[35:03.210 --> 35:04.610]  No, I didn't blow it up!
[35:05.010 --> 35:06.510]  It wasn't me!
[35:06.630 --> 35:11.250]  How is everything blowing up if apparently nobody's blowing things up?
[35:11.370 --> 35:12.050]  No, I got a good idea.
[35:12.290 --> 35:13.010]  The chopper...
[35:13.730 --> 35:15.130]  We wait for the convoy.
[35:15.310 --> 35:15.910]  Yeah, no shit.
[35:17.370 --> 35:18.290]  You know what?
[35:18.650 --> 35:19.590]  I think you're right.
[35:20.570 --> 35:21.590]  Good idea.
[35:22.110 --> 35:23.010]  But anyway...
[35:25.130 --> 35:29.770]  Andrew, the chopper, I think, fired missiles at us both at the same time.
[35:29.770 --> 35:35.650]  I feel like the guy yelling, I'm throwing sticky bombs, and then everything blows up 40 seconds later.
[35:35.890 --> 35:36.450]  No, but not me!
[35:36.630 --> 35:37.130]  It wasn't me!
[35:37.170 --> 35:40.290]  I didn't actually throw the sticky bombs because it didn't let me.
[35:40.330 --> 35:43.130]  Maybe it was missiles the whole time, maybe it never fell on the truck.
[35:44.550 --> 35:49.130]  I'm just gonna wait, I'm not gonna do anything until they drive onto the bridge or by us.
[35:50.130 --> 35:54.590]  There are so many people watching this and leaving comments that are so upset.
[35:55.110 --> 35:56.130]  They are furious.
[35:57.170 --> 35:58.830]  Oh, my head got wet.
[36:03.450 --> 36:05.830]  I saw that out of the corner of my eye.
[36:14.830 --> 36:16.190]  Can I shoot that bird?
[36:16.770 --> 36:16.930]  Yeah.
[36:17.550 --> 36:18.850]  Yeah, I think so. You should give it a try.
[36:19.630 --> 36:19.830]  Okay.
[36:20.110 --> 36:22.250]  But it might blow us up and fail the mission.
[36:24.290 --> 36:24.830]  I got it!
[36:24.830 --> 36:25.550]  Oh, you did!
[36:26.550 --> 36:27.850]  Whoa, what's that?
[36:28.810 --> 36:29.910]  Alien blaster.
[36:30.730 --> 36:32.510]  Oh, yeah, maybe it's one for the alien blaster.
[36:35.170 --> 36:36.830]  Or maybe not.
[36:39.670 --> 36:40.810]  Damn friendly fire.
[36:42.630 --> 36:44.690]  You can jump real high with it, though.
[36:49.110 --> 36:50.630]  And stuck the landing.
[36:51.490 --> 36:52.050]  Alright.
[36:53.690 --> 36:56.750]  I guess we'll wait to take the chopper.
[37:00.670 --> 37:01.990]  Hey, what happened?
[37:02.110 --> 37:04.190]  It's got explosive rounds and it's just going...
[37:04.190 --> 37:06.950]  Yeah, the chopper just sees us instantly and kills us.
[37:07.010 --> 37:10.190]  No, no, no, no.
[37:10.210 --> 37:10.370]  What?
[37:10.670 --> 37:13.330]  There is some bullshit going on here, I saw that.
[37:13.870 --> 37:14.970]  I fucking saw...
[37:14.970 --> 37:16.830]  Somebody threw a grenade.
[37:18.190 --> 37:18.770]  Someone threw a grenade?
[37:19.530 --> 37:20.090]  Somebody...
[37:20.090 --> 37:20.870]  Who threw a grenade?
[37:21.230 --> 37:23.370]  It's gonna... I think Gavin is throwing shit.
[37:23.630 --> 37:24.710]  Or Eric, or some...
[37:24.710 --> 37:25.430]  Oh, I'm here!
[37:25.770 --> 37:26.530]  I'm officially not!
[37:26.930 --> 37:27.990]  You can buy the chaingun.
[37:28.250 --> 37:29.830]  It's got explosive rounds and went...
[37:29.830 --> 37:30.950]  And then everyone died.
[37:31.330 --> 37:33.050]  So we have to take out the chopper faster?
[37:33.130 --> 37:34.030]  Yeah, yes.
[37:34.350 --> 37:34.670]  Okay.
[37:35.010 --> 37:37.230]  We both have homing rockets, let's just...
[37:37.230 --> 37:37.810]  You and I.
[37:38.010 --> 37:38.150]  Yeah.
[37:38.490 --> 37:40.290]  Let's both lock on at the same time.
[37:40.370 --> 37:41.250]  We'll just shoot at the same time.
[37:43.650 --> 37:44.050]  Okay.
[37:44.450 --> 37:44.770]  Let's do it.
[37:44.890 --> 37:46.070]  Do we want to get on...
[37:46.070 --> 37:48.110]  We want to get on the left side of this rocket again, or what?
[37:48.450 --> 37:49.590]  Someone's fucking...
[37:50.030 --> 37:51.450]  There's no friendly fire.
[37:51.470 --> 37:52.410]  How is it gonna be...
[37:52.410 --> 37:53.150]  There's no friendly fire!
[37:53.430 --> 37:53.670]  Explosions!
[37:54.570 --> 37:55.550]  Think they don't...
[37:55.550 --> 37:56.310]  Well, maybe...
[37:56.310 --> 37:57.110]  You know what?
[37:57.230 --> 37:57.630]  I don't know.
[37:57.710 --> 37:57.850]  You know what?
[37:57.850 --> 37:58.670]  Here, let's test it.
[37:59.270 --> 37:59.570]  Okay.
[38:00.270 --> 38:00.770]  Where are you?
[38:02.930 --> 38:03.230]  Okay.
[38:03.530 --> 38:04.030]  How interesting.
[38:04.190 --> 38:04.850]  We're both alive.
[38:05.030 --> 38:05.130]  What's wrong?
[38:05.290 --> 38:05.570]  What's wrong?
[38:05.770 --> 38:06.850]  We already learned that.
[38:07.930 --> 38:08.810]  Well, we just re-learned it.
[38:08.870 --> 38:09.730]  I thought we did that also.
[38:10.010 --> 38:12.030]  Nick, Nick, if we come up here...
[38:12.030 --> 38:13.770]  I think we're too far though, Eric.
[38:13.830 --> 38:14.510]  We need to be closer.
[38:14.710 --> 38:15.110]  You think so?
[38:15.210 --> 38:16.290]  Should we be on the other side of the bridge?
[38:17.170 --> 38:17.950]  I think if we get on the other side of the bridge...
[38:17.950 --> 38:19.570]  No, we'll die from the cars, I think.
[38:19.570 --> 38:19.990]  Okay, so...
[38:19.990 --> 38:20.610]  Right, so here.
[38:21.050 --> 38:21.410]  Hereabouts.
[38:22.130 --> 38:22.330]  Yeah.
[38:22.590 --> 38:23.030]  Oh, Eric.
[38:23.390 --> 38:23.590]  What?
[38:25.430 --> 38:26.490]  There's a dude in a boat.
[38:26.910 --> 38:28.570]  I don't give a fuck!
[38:28.730 --> 38:29.890]  I wanna beat the mission!
[38:30.330 --> 38:30.890]  I do too!
[38:31.570 --> 38:32.950]  Gotta wait for the chopper to get close.
[38:33.130 --> 38:35.090]  So we're gonna take out the chopper as soon as possible.
[38:35.170 --> 38:35.450]  Is that right?
[38:35.550 --> 38:35.830]  I think...
[38:35.830 --> 38:37.030]  Yeah, I think that's what...
[38:37.030 --> 38:38.470]  Me and Nick both have homing rockets,
[38:38.610 --> 38:39.790]  so when we're both lit up red,
[38:40.070 --> 38:40.730]  we'll call it,
[38:40.870 --> 38:41.410]  we'll fire,
[38:41.570 --> 38:42.830]  and then...
[38:43.350 --> 38:44.630]  That'll be it, hopefully.
[38:44.850 --> 38:45.670]  I just don't know.
[38:45.990 --> 38:47.110]  Like, I'm not sure what else to do.
[38:49.670 --> 38:52.210]  I don't remember this part of the heist,
[38:52.350 --> 38:53.830]  which means it's so easy.
[38:54.350 --> 38:54.830]  Yep.
[38:55.430 --> 38:56.810]  Oh, this is super easy.
[38:57.550 --> 38:59.390]  No one's ever been stuck here before.
[39:00.810 --> 39:01.670]  Ooh, a bird.
[39:03.830 --> 39:04.470]  Got it.
[39:05.430 --> 39:05.910]  Nice.
[39:07.710 --> 39:08.650]  That's so cool.
[39:09.450 --> 39:10.130]  Oh, there it falls!
[39:10.670 --> 39:11.670]  Okay, I got...
[39:11.670 --> 39:12.730]  I got a lock.
[39:12.990 --> 39:13.190]  Ready?
[39:13.610 --> 39:13.990]  Now.
[39:14.690 --> 39:17.930]  Did we get it?
[39:18.250 --> 39:18.450]  Yeah.
[39:18.450 --> 39:19.890]  Hang on, hang on.
[39:20.070 --> 39:21.350]  It's not down, it's not down.
[39:21.570 --> 39:22.550]  It lived somehow.
[39:22.890 --> 39:23.290]  It's not down.
[39:23.470 --> 39:24.230]  It's coming back up!
[39:24.350 --> 39:25.090]  It's coming back up!
[39:25.110 --> 39:25.610]  Firing at it.
[39:26.550 --> 39:27.050]  Gavin died.
[39:27.450 --> 39:28.810]  Oh, it does have explosive rounds.
[39:29.330 --> 39:29.730]  Fuck.
[39:30.290 --> 39:32.750]  How many shots does it take to get it down?
[39:34.110 --> 39:35.810]  I felt like we hit it three times.
[39:36.870 --> 39:38.190]  We at least hit it three times, yeah.
[39:38.810 --> 39:39.210]  Wow.
[39:39.650 --> 39:41.410]  Can anyone snipe the pilot?
[39:42.230 --> 39:42.930]  Yeah, I was trying.
[39:43.130 --> 39:43.950]  That's a tough shot.
[39:44.730 --> 39:45.670]  I bet it can be done.
[39:48.110 --> 39:48.470]  Yeah.
[39:50.010 --> 39:51.490]  How long do you want this video to be?
[39:51.870 --> 39:55.630]  Hey, Andrew, before you fire, call it out, because we want to make sure we all have a lock.
[39:56.770 --> 39:57.870]  They're shooting at it.
[39:57.970 --> 39:58.050]  Oh!
[39:58.370 --> 39:58.810]  I got him.
[39:58.890 --> 39:59.390]  It's down!
[39:59.670 --> 40:00.450]  What did you...
[40:00.450 --> 40:00.970]  Did you?
[40:01.270 --> 40:01.970]  Yeah, I just sniped him.
[40:02.190 --> 40:03.070]  Holy shit!
[40:03.170 --> 40:03.550]  Hey, you know what?
[40:03.590 --> 40:04.630]  Don't bother calling out.
[40:04.870 --> 40:05.550]  Don't bother.
[40:05.790 --> 40:06.350]  We don't need it.
[40:06.390 --> 40:08.410]  We both just sniped him and he went down immediately.
[40:08.910 --> 40:08.950]  Wow!
[40:09.930 --> 40:10.890]  Well, that was...
[40:10.890 --> 40:12.590]  It just says go to the location?
[40:12.850 --> 40:14.050]  Is that...
[40:14.050 --> 40:15.510]  I have wait for the convoy still.
[40:15.510 --> 40:16.050]  Okay, cool.
[40:16.150 --> 40:16.870]  Alright, good, good, good.
[40:17.490 --> 40:18.090]  Good, good.
[40:18.470 --> 40:20.650]  They're going to be suspicious of this dead seagull.
[40:20.750 --> 40:20.930]  I know.
[40:22.610 --> 40:23.370]  Oh, they don't...
[40:23.370 --> 40:23.850]  They didn't know?
[40:24.950 --> 40:26.850]  Yeah, they didn't notice that they were...
[40:26.850 --> 40:27.070]  Okay.
[40:27.250 --> 40:28.290]  Alright, snipe the dudes in the truck.
[40:28.590 --> 40:29.430]  So I can take out the driver.
[40:30.070 --> 40:30.210]  Yeah.
[40:31.770 --> 40:32.550]  Alright, go for it.
[40:34.070 --> 40:34.490]  Alright, what...
[40:34.490 --> 40:34.690]  Got him.
[40:34.850 --> 40:35.050]  Nice.
[40:35.530 --> 40:36.650]  Oh, shit!
[40:38.830 --> 40:39.470]  Alright, well...
[40:39.830 --> 40:40.150]  Nice.
[40:40.350 --> 40:40.830]  Alright, they're down.
[40:44.210 --> 40:44.530]  Don't!
[40:44.530 --> 40:45.130]  Don't, don't, don't!
[40:45.550 --> 40:46.150]  That is an insane decision.
[40:46.150 --> 40:46.770]  It's going to blow up the truck!
[40:47.510 --> 40:47.910]  Careful!
[40:48.190 --> 40:49.510]  Why did you do that?
[40:49.770 --> 40:50.170]  Careful!
[40:50.470 --> 40:51.330]  It won't blow up the truck.
[40:52.150 --> 40:53.190]  It will blow...
[40:53.190 --> 40:54.470]  We blowed up the truck!
[40:55.430 --> 40:55.910]  Did it?
[40:56.070 --> 40:56.610]  I'm getting hit.
[40:56.830 --> 40:57.250]  I'm getting hit.
[40:58.110 --> 40:58.810]  I'm okay, though.
[40:58.870 --> 40:59.570]  The truck's fine.
[41:00.470 --> 41:01.270]  Yeah, it's...
[41:01.270 --> 41:02.010]  Oh, my God.
[41:02.150 --> 41:02.750]  I'm just taking it.
[41:02.790 --> 41:03.250]  I'm just taking it.
[41:03.850 --> 41:04.730]  Take it and go.
[41:07.330 --> 41:08.410]  Fuck, it's the other way.
[41:08.710 --> 41:09.250]  Oh, shit!
[41:09.930 --> 41:10.830]  Oh, my God!
[41:10.930 --> 41:12.090]  Oh, my God, Andrew!
[41:12.470 --> 41:13.890]  For God's sake.
[41:14.530 --> 41:15.330]  The other way.
[41:16.550 --> 41:16.970]  Get in the armor!
[41:17.230 --> 41:18.450]  Hop in, boys!
[41:19.930 --> 41:21.510]  We got helicopters coming!
[41:21.810 --> 41:24.170]  You go, you go, you go, you go, you go!
[41:25.410 --> 41:27.650]  Jesus Christ, what an annoyance to try to...
[41:28.070 --> 41:29.350]  Wait, let me get in the main truck.
[41:29.430 --> 41:30.370]  Oh, let's get in the big one!
[41:31.490 --> 41:32.210]  Let's do this.
[41:32.570 --> 41:33.210]  Helicopters coming!
[41:34.030 --> 41:34.490]  I'm driving!
[41:34.870 --> 41:35.170]  Okay.
[41:35.630 --> 41:36.710]  Let me get up on the thing.
[41:38.150 --> 41:38.790]  Alright, let's do it.
[41:39.250 --> 41:39.690]  Alright, let's go.
[41:40.430 --> 41:41.090]  Take a snack.
[41:41.970 --> 41:42.170]  Yeah!
[41:43.530 --> 41:45.110]  Oh, shit, Nick!
[41:45.110 --> 41:45.190]  Oh, my God!
[41:45.430 --> 41:46.090]  It's working!
[41:49.920 --> 41:52.050]  I got people shooting at me!
[41:52.470 --> 41:53.790]  Yeah, yeah, we're coming, we're coming.
[41:57.850 --> 41:58.390]  Nice.
[42:00.690 --> 42:02.570]  Nick, what are you doing?
[42:02.990 --> 42:03.630]  Well, I'm driving!
[42:08.740 --> 42:10.680]  Oh, chopper straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead!
[42:11.460 --> 42:12.000]  Oh!
[42:12.840 --> 42:13.650]  Oh, shit!
[42:14.720 --> 42:15.520]  I'm driving.
[42:16.320 --> 42:17.200]  Holy shit!
[42:17.520 --> 42:18.460]  Oh, fuck.
[42:19.360 --> 42:21.680]  You have to focus on the helicopter, Gavin.
[42:22.060 --> 42:22.900]  The one behind us?
[42:23.640 --> 42:24.720]  I'm trying to escape!
[42:25.820 --> 42:26.840]  I'm right behind you!
[42:27.960 --> 42:28.820]  Keep going!
[42:30.860 --> 42:31.580]  Got it!
[42:32.400 --> 42:33.680]  Oh, my God, Andrew!
[42:34.160 --> 42:34.620]  You alright?
[42:34.880 --> 42:35.140]  I'm good.
[42:35.180 --> 42:36.880]  It just says, escape Merriweather.
[42:36.980 --> 42:38.020]  Do we have to kill all these guys?
[42:38.320 --> 42:38.620]  Yeah, just kill them.
[42:38.840 --> 42:39.020]  Just kill them.
[42:39.040 --> 42:39.900]  Just get away from them.
[42:41.240 --> 42:42.880]  The easy way to do this is to kill them.
[42:43.380 --> 42:44.040]  Oh, God!
[42:44.840 --> 42:45.920]  We've got two choppers, son.
[42:48.000 --> 42:48.640]  Oh, fuck.
[42:48.640 --> 42:49.060]  Oh, my God.
[42:49.660 --> 42:50.100]  How are we gonna-
[42:50.100 --> 42:51.140]  Oh, the dirt road is blocked.
[42:51.700 --> 42:52.320]  Oh, no.
[42:53.780 --> 42:54.420]  Oh, fuck.
[42:54.460 --> 42:55.260]  He shotgunned me.
[42:55.620 --> 42:56.100]  I'm okay.
[42:57.740 --> 42:58.600]  It's a tough chopper.
[42:58.620 --> 42:59.120]  Let me take the lead.
[42:59.180 --> 42:59.640]  Let me take the lead.
[42:59.880 --> 43:00.900]  Yes, yes, yes!
[43:04.340 --> 43:05.000]  Keep it going.
[43:05.200 --> 43:05.740]  Keep it going.
[43:06.260 --> 43:06.980]  Gavin, you got this.
[43:07.020 --> 43:07.460]  You got this.
[43:07.860 --> 43:08.420]  Gavin, you got him.
[43:08.460 --> 43:08.820]  You got him.
[43:10.380 --> 43:10.700]  Alright.
[43:11.240 --> 43:11.560]  Yes!
[43:12.120 --> 43:12.680]  Helicopters down-
[43:12.680 --> 43:13.080]  Oh, fuck.
[43:13.140 --> 43:14.260]  There's another one.
[43:14.420 --> 43:15.060]  Oh, shit.
[43:15.140 --> 43:15.380]  Sorry.
[43:16.060 --> 43:16.700]  Oh, shit.
[43:16.820 --> 43:17.780]  I'm real hurt.
[43:17.860 --> 43:18.120]  Keep going.
[43:18.160 --> 43:18.400]  Keep going.
[43:18.460 --> 43:18.720]  Keep going.
[43:18.740 --> 43:19.000]  Keep going.
[43:19.040 --> 43:19.320]  Keep going.
[43:20.340 --> 43:21.260]  I'll swing around ahead of you.
[43:21.540 --> 43:22.640]  I just don't know-
[43:22.640 --> 43:23.240]  Chopper ahead.
[43:23.380 --> 43:24.020]  Chopper ahead.
[43:28.200 --> 43:30.860]  Ooh, make sure to get snacks if you haven't.
[43:31.720 --> 43:32.040]  Fuck!
[43:33.640 --> 43:34.000]  Keep going.
[43:34.040 --> 43:34.300]  Keep going.
[43:34.340 --> 43:34.760]  We'll cover you.
[43:34.900 --> 43:35.360]  Yeah, I'm good.
[43:35.980 --> 43:36.600]  Gavin, behind us.
[43:36.660 --> 43:37.380]  Gavin, behind us.
[43:37.840 --> 43:38.020]  Gavin.
[43:38.120 --> 43:38.280]  I'm in front.
[43:39.400 --> 43:40.340]  I'll get the guy in front of us.
[43:40.340 --> 43:41.340]  I'm going-
[43:43.140 --> 43:43.680]  Which way did you go?
[43:44.220 --> 43:44.860]  Swinging left.
[43:45.740 --> 43:46.540]  Is that the right way?
[43:46.640 --> 43:47.160]  I don't know.
[43:47.840 --> 43:49.140]  There's no right way.
[43:49.200 --> 43:49.820]  It's just a skate.
[43:49.960 --> 43:50.000]  Oh, okay.
[43:50.140 --> 43:51.800]  I thought it may have given him like a-
[43:51.800 --> 43:52.260]  No, no, no, no.
[43:52.320 --> 43:53.000]  I'm just like-
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.880]  I'm gonna get off this path that they seem to be lined on.
[43:58.900 --> 43:59.220]  Alright.
[43:59.860 --> 44:00.700]  Gavin, you're doing great.
[44:00.800 --> 44:01.320]  Keep doing it.
[44:01.740 --> 44:02.720]  Yeah, you're killing it, dude.
[44:05.400 --> 44:06.760]  And there's one more up here.
[44:08.080 --> 44:08.680]  Swinging back.
[44:08.760 --> 44:09.560]  You guys-
[44:09.560 --> 44:10.560]  How are there-
[44:11.720 --> 44:12.580]  I see him up here.
[44:12.680 --> 44:13.040]  I'll get him.
[44:14.020 --> 44:14.400]  Straight ahead.
[44:17.320 --> 44:18.900]  What the fuck?
[44:19.140 --> 44:20.020]  Oh my god.
[44:21.000 --> 44:21.520]  Okay, one more.
[44:21.580 --> 44:21.920]  One more.
[44:22.100 --> 44:22.540]  Behind us.
[44:23.520 --> 44:24.340]  No, there's two more.
[44:24.780 --> 44:25.100]  Oh, yeah.
[44:25.460 --> 44:25.780]  Shit.
[44:26.200 --> 44:26.620]  Where are they?
[44:26.740 --> 44:26.960]  It's alright.
[44:27.000 --> 44:27.360]  Here they come.
[44:27.700 --> 44:28.200]  Left side.
[44:29.500 --> 44:30.660]  Should we be coming up this road now?
[44:31.040 --> 44:31.260]  Yeah.
[44:31.720 --> 44:32.900]  You want me to go towards him or wait?
[44:33.140 --> 44:33.580]  Okay, let's go.
[44:34.560 --> 44:35.700]  Oh, he's-
[44:35.700 --> 44:36.220]  Got him.
[44:36.500 --> 44:36.720]  One more.
[44:36.800 --> 44:37.160]  One more.
[44:37.160 --> 44:37.640]  Nice.
[44:37.780 --> 44:39.240]  It'll be up here around to the right.
[44:40.160 --> 44:40.940]  Right there.
[44:42.500 --> 44:43.080]  Too far.
[44:43.740 --> 44:44.040]  Too far.
[44:47.200 --> 44:47.600]  Nice.
[44:47.840 --> 44:48.020]  Got him.
[44:48.320 --> 44:50.040]  We're right next to where we need to be.
[44:50.540 --> 44:50.880]  Let's do it.
[44:50.920 --> 44:51.200]  Wow.
[44:52.860 --> 44:53.420]  Nick, stop.
[44:54.300 --> 44:55.000]  Don't get-
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.120]  Please don't get close to Andrew.
[44:56.420 --> 44:56.700]  Let's just beat this.
[44:56.700 --> 44:57.060]  No, no, no.
[44:57.340 --> 44:58.040]  I won't.
[44:58.040 --> 44:58.300]  I know.
[44:58.560 --> 44:59.380]  I wasn't going to touch him.
[44:59.460 --> 44:59.740]  Don't worry.
[45:01.740 --> 45:02.620]  Why do you worry?
[45:03.060 --> 45:04.000]  I don't think-
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.940]  I hope you understand I'm not worried about intention.
[45:07.800 --> 45:09.140]  Press Y to deliver the truck.
[45:13.980 --> 45:14.400]  See?
[45:14.720 --> 45:15.340]  Didn't touch him.
[45:18.120 --> 45:18.420]  That was-
[45:18.420 --> 45:19.900]  That was crazy.
[45:20.220 --> 45:20.580]  Amazing.
[45:21.740 --> 45:22.440]  Nice job.
[45:22.920 --> 45:23.720]  Great shooting, Gavin.
[45:24.340 --> 45:24.840]  Thanks, Nick.
[45:28.290 --> 45:30.330]  I like that she's just chilling in that house the whole time.
[45:31.870 --> 45:33.750]  I just got confirmation-
[45:33.750 --> 45:35.370]  I mean, it doesn't matter because this will come out whenever.
[45:35.370 --> 45:39.530]  I just got confirmation that we'll receive the Gerplers February 1st.
[45:39.530 --> 45:40.810]  Oh, awesome.
[45:41.490 --> 45:41.710]  Yeah.
[45:42.890 --> 45:44.310]  Nice Q1 gup.
[45:44.830 --> 45:45.050]  Yep.
[45:45.910 --> 45:46.770]  Set a pest.
[45:49.130 --> 45:50.370]  Look at that platinum.
[45:51.270 --> 45:51.890]  Triple strat.
[45:52.790 --> 45:53.430]  Back to back.
[45:55.010 --> 45:55.650]  Nice.
[45:56.330 --> 45:58.430]  Gavin, welcome to Jackass.
[45:59.190 --> 46:00.510]  Meow, meow, meow.
