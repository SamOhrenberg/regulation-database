[00:00.000 --> 00:03.280]  Welcome to golf with your friends or whatever this is called
[00:03.280 --> 00:08.000]  It's another game of golf and we're playing on the worms course because we just played the worst game of worms
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.980]  We've ever seen, but all five of us played so it's fun
[00:12.120 --> 00:18.240]  Nick you're leading this thing. Let's get started. All right. Here we go. What? What?
[00:18.760 --> 00:22.000]  Well, I was gonna change the color of my ball because Nick and I are both blue. Shut up!
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.540]  Shut up forever!
[00:23.540 --> 00:23.760]  Shut up!
[00:26.600 --> 00:27.400]  Shut up!
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.640]  I was trying to make it easier!
[00:29.100 --> 00:35.320]  Man, it sucks when you're the one person that the other four people all hate at the same time, but it's so great when it's not you
[00:37.180 --> 00:38.880]  I've made a living off that
[00:38.880 --> 00:39.460]  Bam!
[00:40.440 --> 00:41.040]  How do I?
[00:41.900 --> 00:42.300]  No!
[00:44.340 --> 00:46.240]  Okay, now I remember. Shit!
[00:47.040 --> 00:48.180]  What the f- what's the buttons?
[00:49.040 --> 00:50.320]  How do I fucking play?
[00:50.400 --> 00:51.800]  You just push forward on the thing
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.740]  What is that? On the left stick
[00:54.740 --> 00:55.560]  In the hole!
[00:56.580 --> 00:57.620]  You push forward?
[00:57.760 --> 00:58.900]  Like to control
[01:00.240 --> 01:02.620]  Right into Gavin. Yeah, I got it
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.520]  Get in! Get in!
[01:05.540 --> 01:06.420]  We've played this before, right?
[01:07.500 --> 01:10.000]  I got boggy
[01:10.400 --> 01:12.860]  I get this game and golf it confused
[01:12.860 --> 01:14.820]  Yeah, me too. It's all messed up
[01:15.180 --> 01:15.480]  Yeah
[01:16.920 --> 01:18.580]  We also have 3D Ultra Mini Golf 2
[01:18.580 --> 01:20.860]  Yeah. Oh, let's play that
[01:21.720 --> 01:24.960]  And I think more maps in 3D Ultra Mini Golf
[01:24.960 --> 01:25.040]  Oh
[01:26.920 --> 01:27.940]  Just put it in the hole
[01:28.580 --> 01:29.740]  Gavin! Just tap it in
[01:29.740 --> 01:30.620]  Put it in the fucking hole
[01:30.620 --> 01:31.960]  What? Why did you say my name?
[01:34.580 --> 01:35.500]  What do you-
[01:35.500 --> 01:37.500]  We're watching you not shoot the ball
[01:37.500 --> 01:41.040]  If you just installed the game, make sure your video framerate is set to 60fps
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.060]  Oh yeah, I was wondering why my framerate's a bag of dicks
[01:43.060 --> 01:44.100]  Yeah, mine looks like dog shit
[01:44.100 --> 01:45.540]  Where do I set that?
[01:45.700 --> 01:47.100]  Start, go to...
[01:47.100 --> 01:49.160]  We should start over probably
[01:49.160 --> 01:49.860]  Yes
[01:49.860 --> 01:52.100]  Target framerate, control
[01:52.100 --> 01:54.160]  30 frames
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.320]  Game
[01:57.120 --> 01:59.980]  I've never played this game at 60. This is great
[01:59.980 --> 02:01.740]  Oh my god
[02:01.740 --> 02:02.800]  What a difference
[02:02.800 --> 02:04.280]  We should probably start over
[02:04.280 --> 02:06.700]  Nah, we're fine
[02:06.700 --> 02:08.600]  It's all organic, man
[02:09.580 --> 02:11.260]  Why would anyone play on 30?
[02:11.360 --> 02:12.280]  I don't know
[02:12.280 --> 02:14.760]  There's a mine there you should look out
[02:14.760 --> 02:16.600]  Oh no
[02:16.600 --> 02:17.980]  Where do we go?
[02:18.680 --> 02:19.200]  Hello
[02:19.200 --> 02:21.100]  Bink bonk
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.240]  Yep
[02:25.240 --> 02:27.680]  No, Eric, you piece of shit
[02:27.680 --> 02:29.800]  I forgot about this game
[02:29.800 --> 02:32.860]  I forgot about this game
[02:32.860 --> 02:33.780]  This game rocks
[02:33.780 --> 02:36.380]  I forgot what you do in this game and now I remember
[02:36.380 --> 02:37.720]  What do you do in this game?
[02:38.100 --> 02:39.220]  You hit Andrew
[02:40.740 --> 02:41.260]  Ha!
[02:42.300 --> 02:44.560]  That was gonna be 2-8, it was 5
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:47.360 --> 02:48.480]  I remember this now
[02:50.440 --> 02:50.920]  Whoops
[02:51.840 --> 02:53.200]  Oh, look at this
[02:54.120 --> 02:54.600]  What?
[02:55.620 --> 02:56.640]  Gotta time it
[02:56.640 --> 02:58.300]  Do you just collect those?
[02:59.280 --> 03:01.280]  I'm not telling you fucks
[03:01.280 --> 03:02.120]  You'll figure it out
[03:02.120 --> 03:05.160]  Oh my god, jetpack, that was way better than what I need
[03:07.100 --> 03:08.000]  I'll get it!
[03:08.840 --> 03:13.370]  That was so much better than the jetpack
[03:13.370 --> 03:14.490]  I just used in worms
[03:15.210 --> 03:15.810]  No!
[03:16.830 --> 03:18.010]  I'm going backwards!
[03:22.730 --> 03:23.290]  Yes!
[03:24.670 --> 03:25.950]  Go in the hole
[03:27.210 --> 03:29.930]  Were you trying to hit him, you piece of shit?
[03:30.510 --> 03:31.430]  Come on
[03:32.250 --> 03:32.850]  No!
[03:33.150 --> 03:34.910]  Why is this so hard for me?
[03:37.050 --> 03:37.790]  There we go
[03:39.410 --> 03:40.530]  Nailed it
[03:42.070 --> 03:42.810]  Where'd he go?
[03:43.610 --> 03:44.630]  Andrew!
[03:45.170 --> 03:45.790]  There we go
[03:50.150 --> 03:52.070]  You missed
[03:53.150 --> 03:54.550]  Go quick Andrew
[03:54.550 --> 03:55.450]  No!
[03:59.570 --> 04:00.810]  I'm a big game hunter
[04:00.810 --> 04:06.590]  No, no, no
[04:06.590 --> 04:06.970]  Go
[04:09.350 --> 04:10.270]  Yeah, no!
[04:12.230 --> 04:13.370]  Damn it
[04:20.770 --> 04:22.370]  Stupid deer
[04:22.990 --> 04:24.170]  Dumbass looking deer
[04:24.170 --> 04:25.270]  Stupid little deer
[04:25.270 --> 04:27.030]  Look at his dumbass little hat
[04:29.750 --> 04:31.930]  I'm just peeking out of the hole
[04:32.930 --> 04:33.730]  Christ
[04:33.730 --> 04:35.350]  Stupid ass
[04:36.810 --> 04:37.930]  Where are we going here?
[04:37.930 --> 04:39.010]  Oh boy
[04:43.770 --> 04:46.590]  Ah, Eric!
[04:51.070 --> 04:51.830]  Damn it!
[04:56.270 --> 04:57.050]  Come on
[05:03.590 --> 05:04.470]  Draining it
[05:05.850 --> 05:07.630]  Drain it Nick, drain it
[05:07.630 --> 05:09.350]  Come on Nick, put it in the hole
[05:10.350 --> 05:11.590]  Did Andrew finish already?
[05:12.110 --> 05:13.170]  Oh he did, okay
[05:13.170 --> 05:15.150]  He finished hard
[05:15.150 --> 05:16.770]  Running away from a stupid reindeer
[05:17.810 --> 05:19.590]  What's he talking about?
[05:19.750 --> 05:21.210]  What the hell is this?
[05:21.650 --> 05:22.730]  It comes back!
[05:24.010 --> 05:26.030]  What if I did this?
[05:26.690 --> 05:27.530]  Oh my god
[05:28.290 --> 05:29.650]  Is this the right place?
[05:29.850 --> 05:31.250]  Oh my god, I almost got a hole in one
[05:31.250 --> 05:32.170]  I was on the wrong hole
[05:33.930 --> 05:35.510]  I'm definitely not getting a hole in one
[05:35.510 --> 05:36.390]  You got it, I hope
[05:37.270 --> 05:38.650]  Oh dude, that did help
[05:38.650 --> 05:39.550]  Big time, thank you
[05:39.550 --> 05:41.250]  Holy shit
[05:42.590 --> 05:43.310]  Oh no
[05:43.990 --> 05:45.490]  Nope, that didn't help me though
[05:45.490 --> 05:46.630]  Geoff you idiot
[05:49.670 --> 05:50.710]  Thank you
[05:52.850 --> 05:53.890]  Come back
[05:53.890 --> 05:54.870]  No
[05:57.150 --> 05:59.070]  Gonna get it
[06:01.950 --> 06:02.990]  Nice job Geoff
[06:02.990 --> 06:04.690]  Thank you
[06:04.690 --> 06:06.630]  No, why did it go the other way?
[06:08.030 --> 06:10.130]  He half piped it like Tony Hawk
[06:11.630 --> 06:12.770]  There you go
[06:13.530 --> 06:14.610]  Stupid reindeer
[06:16.150 --> 06:17.590]  Oh, damn it
[06:18.850 --> 06:19.910]  Oh it's Andrew
[06:19.910 --> 06:20.630]  Oh there he is
[06:24.010 --> 06:25.090]  Stupid deer
[06:30.370 --> 06:30.930]  What?
[06:34.690 --> 06:36.090]  Oh they both happened in bed
[06:36.090 --> 06:37.610]  It's like a shagging ring
[06:37.610 --> 06:38.690]  That's not so surprising
[06:38.690 --> 06:39.910]  I guess not
[06:39.910 --> 06:41.930]  They both happened in bed
[06:43.670 --> 06:44.690]  Oh dude
[06:46.150 --> 06:48.010]  I don't know what I'm doing
[06:48.750 --> 06:49.790]  Is this right?
[06:50.350 --> 06:50.930]  Oh shit
[06:50.930 --> 06:52.070]  Where am I going?
[06:54.330 --> 06:55.270]  Where am I going?
[06:56.310 --> 06:57.230]  Where am I idiot?
[07:00.030 --> 07:01.470]  Oh son of a bitch
[07:01.470 --> 07:02.730]  There we go
[07:04.290 --> 07:06.450]  How did I end up back in the start?
[07:08.610 --> 07:10.230]  Where am I supposed to
[07:10.230 --> 07:10.930]  No
[07:11.970 --> 07:12.490]  No
[07:12.490 --> 07:16.710]  Oh god
[07:19.420 --> 07:20.760]  Well that could have gone better
[07:20.760 --> 07:23.520]  This is the end of me this level
[07:24.040 --> 07:24.300]  Why?
[07:25.500 --> 07:25.900]  Uh oh
[07:28.180 --> 07:28.700]  So
[07:33.480 --> 07:34.520]  Oh shit
[07:37.960 --> 07:38.600]  No
[07:40.300 --> 07:42.160]  I had it
[07:42.160 --> 07:43.260]  I had it
[07:44.360 --> 07:46.280]  It was so close
[07:46.280 --> 07:46.800]  Okay okay
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.060]  Wind up
[07:49.880 --> 07:50.640]  Good
[07:52.320 --> 07:53.840]  Damn it
[07:53.840 --> 07:56.360]  Come on baby
[07:56.360 --> 07:57.400]  Let me roll it
[08:04.350 --> 08:05.870]  God dude
[08:05.870 --> 08:07.770]  I'm so all over the map
[08:08.170 --> 08:09.190]  I'm so fucked.
[08:10.270 --> 08:12.030]  I'm back in, you fuck.
[08:14.650 --> 08:19.590]  20 seconds! 20 seconds! Ah, shit. Oh, no. Where am I? I can't see.
[08:21.830 --> 08:22.610]  Come on, Geoff.
[08:22.930 --> 08:26.130]  Roll, Geoff, roll! You son of a bitch.
[08:26.810 --> 08:26.930]  Ah!
[08:27.850 --> 08:32.930]  Oh, Gavin, you're there. Gavin, you just gotta bounce a couple times. That's it. Gavin, give it everything. Gavin, give it everything!
[08:33.290 --> 08:34.590]  Two! One! Go, Gavin, go!
[08:34.910 --> 08:35.650]  Give me that!
[08:41.610 --> 08:42.010]  Fuck.
[08:42.010 --> 08:44.570]  All right. Wow, a 14. Holy shit.
[08:45.710 --> 08:46.910]  Close game all of a sudden.
[08:47.790 --> 08:47.990]  Yeah.
[08:49.130 --> 08:50.850]  Well, I know what I have to do now.
[08:51.510 --> 08:52.990]  And that's ruin everybody else's day.
[08:54.670 --> 08:56.190]  Oh my god, what does the poison do?
[08:58.170 --> 08:59.770]  I don't know. You're the worms guy.
[09:01.690 --> 09:06.550]  He's got you there. How many people can get poisoned, Gavin? Fuck! Six.
[09:07.290 --> 09:15.530]  Birdie! I'm a little birdie. Geoff! Geoff! Geoff, what are you doing? I went the wrong way.
[09:18.950 --> 09:22.210]  Oh, there's Gavin. Get him. There's Nick. Get Nick.
[09:24.930 --> 09:26.990]  I went in on Nick! That was amazing!
[09:28.510 --> 09:32.150]  Geoff, let me help you. Geoff, hold on. No! Geoff, hold on.
[09:37.590 --> 09:40.270]  You royally screwed me, Gavin. I'm falling apart.
[09:42.110 --> 09:44.310]  Here we go. Here we go.
[09:45.610 --> 09:46.190]  Hold on.
[09:55.610 --> 09:58.230]  Let's go, boys! What the hell are you doing?
[09:58.850 --> 10:01.790]  Oh, bomb! Who did that to me? Was that bad?
[10:05.990 --> 10:10.050]  Who? Uh-oh. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
[10:11.810 --> 10:14.990]  I get blown all over the fucking map here!
[10:17.470 --> 10:22.730]  Oh, what a load of bull. You fat sack of deer shit.
[10:23.610 --> 10:30.670]  No, no, no, no! The bomb hits me! What are you doing? I'm going back halfway around the twi-
[10:30.670 --> 10:32.450]  Oh, oh, oh!
[10:33.870 --> 10:37.270]  No! Not here. Not here. Not here.
[10:38.030 --> 10:41.830]  The stress of seeing other people.
[10:41.910 --> 10:50.330]  No! No! Who did that to me?
[10:54.570 --> 10:59.650]  Look at his stupid eyes. Look at his stupid face.
[11:01.030 --> 11:03.810]  I'm going the wrong way! You're going so far back!
[11:04.370 --> 11:09.230]  I'm going the wrong way! The deer's going the wrong way, and you're the only person on the course, and there's no one to catch!
[11:16.150 --> 11:19.650]  Disable chat, I think, for this game going forward. Yeah, how do I stop reading that?
[11:23.310 --> 11:24.950]  Pretty close game up at the top.
[11:26.590 --> 11:30.650]  Oh, this one. Holy hand grenade! Oh, it's a holy hand grenade! Who would ever play this game?
[11:30.670 --> 11:34.910]  It's 30 fps. Oh, no. Oh, no!
[11:35.210 --> 11:37.450]  Gave me the push I needed. Oh, boys!
[11:37.810 --> 11:42.310]  Uh-oh. Things are bad, fellas!
[11:45.050 --> 11:46.930]  Pretty much back where I started. All right.
[11:50.970 --> 11:59.770]  Nope. Not enough beans. Nope. I don't have beans in that chili. Oh, no.
[12:00.670 --> 12:02.270]  Woo-hoo!
[12:04.450 --> 12:10.590]  Oh, no! Oh, no! His stupid face! His stupid face! No, Nick!
[12:10.590 --> 12:14.170]  Oh, Nick, you were there! I was!
[12:17.560 --> 12:24.380]  This is so hard. Oh, my god. All right, hold still. Hold still. Hold still. You got this. Stop!
[12:26.860 --> 12:27.260]  Bogey!
[12:29.060 --> 12:33.360]  Oh, that might actually put me where I need to be. This rocks. Keep rolling!
[12:36.580 --> 12:42.200]  No! Oh, come on, Eric! Oh, no! Stop, stop, stop! Geoff, look out!
[12:44.320 --> 12:44.720]  No!
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.440]  Oh, no! Go right! No! I'm stuck in an infinite loop of hell! Come on, Geoff, you can do it!
[12:51.560 --> 12:53.980]  Come on, Geoff! I'm stuck in a hell loop!
[12:55.300 --> 12:56.040]  Yes!
[13:20.320 --> 13:28.120]  You fool! I still lived, Andrew! Look at his face! Look at his face!
[13:28.140 --> 13:29.580]  Look at his stupid face!
[13:30.140 --> 13:36.400]  Gavin, you finished this hole and said nothing?
[13:37.040 --> 13:39.860]  We did! No, I shouted bogey. Oh, I didn't hear it!
[13:40.540 --> 13:45.380]  I almost let myself not finish because I was hunting for you!
[13:46.800 --> 13:49.940]  Why do you worry about yourself? Well, I did in the end.
[13:51.660 --> 13:52.000]  Good deal.
[13:58.140 --> 14:01.160]  I'm trying so hard to get it off before you...
[14:04.680 --> 14:07.440]  Oh, that worked out great, thank you.
[14:10.120 --> 14:12.080]  I gotta get out of here.
[14:19.740 --> 14:22.440]  He's slowly falling in.
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.480]  I see what's going on here. Gavin's just quietly finishing a hole.
[14:28.880 --> 14:31.160]  Yeah, I said birdie and then I went...
[14:31.160 --> 14:32.640]  Am I deaf? What's going on?
[14:32.640 --> 14:34.480]  Yeah, why didn't you listen to me for once?
[14:35.820 --> 14:37.340]  It's my new favorite bit!
[14:38.260 --> 14:43.800]  Nick attacking Gavin and then Gavin saying I said it and then Nick immediately just attacking himself.
[14:45.420 --> 14:47.460]  Oh, where's the hole?
[14:48.360 --> 14:49.600]  Where is it? Oh, damn.
[14:49.940 --> 14:54.860]  No, it's far. Geez. It's a long way. You guys got plenty. It's a year. Oh, yeah, it's fine. You're good.
[14:56.740 --> 14:58.020]  Just let me know when you're getting close.
[14:59.140 --> 15:00.080]  Did that work?
[15:01.140 --> 15:01.460]  Nope.
[15:02.240 --> 15:04.820]  Uh-oh. Okay. I don't know where close is.
[15:06.500 --> 15:10.220]  Oops. Oops. Well, you actually helped me I think, Gavin. Fuck. Damn it.
[15:11.680 --> 15:12.220]  Thanks, bud.
[15:14.520 --> 15:14.820]  Uh-oh.
[15:15.440 --> 15:22.580]  It doesn't make any sense that the poison barrels are so explosive. You piece of shit! You've jumped the hole, you...
[15:26.140 --> 15:27.680]  No, you set off the idiot!
[15:32.700 --> 15:33.820]  Go quick, Gavin!
[15:38.760 --> 15:40.460]  I swine and wait, Gavin!
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.340]  Oh, it sent you back?
[15:46.600 --> 15:50.020]  I'm a predator. I'm coming to get you. Go! Go! Go!
[15:52.180 --> 15:53.660]  Oh, damn it!
[15:59.700 --> 16:06.840]  It looks like the dumbest thing ever taking that sleigh ride. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:07.420 --> 16:07.880]  No!
[16:09.840 --> 16:10.420]  Stupid.
[16:12.140 --> 16:15.480]  Oh, 11. Geez. 11.
[16:16.580 --> 16:21.560]  Oh, Nick with five on that one. Shit. What is Nick doing over there? We gotta attack Nick.
[16:22.020 --> 16:26.920]  Yeah, we gotta go after Nick. Yeah, I agree. I agree. We gotta go after Nick. We got new gameplay in here.
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.100]  I agree. We gotta go after Nick.
[16:31.140 --> 16:35.340]  I don't think anybody wants to see Nick succeed. Why not? Exactly.
[16:35.720 --> 16:40.780]  Ah, thank you.
[16:47.870 --> 16:48.510]  Oh!
[16:49.970 --> 16:50.810]  What the hell?
[16:58.540 --> 17:01.160]  It's gonna be bad for me.
[17:03.480 --> 17:04.940]  Oh, you suck!
[17:10.320 --> 17:13.760]  Oh, way to go, Nick. Oh, no!
[17:16.300 --> 17:19.100]  The sheep. Look out for the sheep.
[17:21.860 --> 17:28.780]  All right, needs to be more than that. Oh, Andrew's coming for you. I got it in the hole, Nick!
[17:30.540 --> 17:33.440]  Oh, you missed me! Oh! Damn it.
[17:39.770 --> 17:43.110]  Luckily, the sheep won't hurt me. No! My friend!
[17:43.710 --> 17:49.990]  Oh, Geoff, you can do it. I felt like I did really good on that hole and then double bogey pops up
[17:49.990 --> 17:52.070]  and it just ruins it. Oh, Geoff!
[17:52.490 --> 17:57.530]  Geoff! Oh, shit. Dude, this is nothing compared to the Vietnam war I've already been through at the beginning of the map.
[17:59.010 --> 18:00.210]  With the jet pack.
[18:02.250 --> 18:05.250]  Oh my god. I don't even give a fuck at this point, dude.
[18:07.350 --> 18:12.870]  I was three holes past giving any kind of any ounce of a shit before I ever saw this sheep.
[18:13.910 --> 18:16.710]  All right, you can sneak past him. And now.
[18:19.090 --> 18:21.570]  Oh, the ledge. Oh my god.
[18:23.210 --> 18:23.910]  That's great.
[18:25.590 --> 18:26.490]  That's just great.
[18:28.010 --> 18:29.310]  I'm happy about that one.
[18:30.750 --> 18:32.030]  We gotta start...
[18:32.030 --> 18:33.750]  start on Nick a little bit more.
[18:34.370 --> 18:35.030]  Eh, meh.
[18:36.370 --> 18:38.430]  Don't give it all the beans! Don't give it all the beans!
[18:39.230 --> 18:40.370]  Give it all the beans, fellas!
[18:40.810 --> 18:41.830]  Too many beans! Too many beans!
[18:41.830 --> 18:41.950]  Too many beans!
[18:50.750 --> 18:53.210]  Ah, shit bag!
[18:55.370 --> 18:57.110]  What you meant to do?
[18:58.470 --> 18:59.590]  Not what I did.
[19:01.870 --> 19:03.430]  Definitely not that.
[19:05.550 --> 19:06.050]  Shit.
[19:07.430 --> 19:07.930]  Shit.
[19:11.690 --> 19:13.910]  That was you! You hit me!
[19:15.010 --> 19:18.350]  Stood in the hole? What the hell are you talking about?
[19:18.730 --> 19:18.850]  No!
[19:19.750 --> 19:20.710]  You're blocking the gap.
[19:21.430 --> 19:21.770]  No!
[19:26.110 --> 19:26.490]  Ah!
[19:28.970 --> 19:30.250]  Talk about worth it.
[19:30.610 --> 19:31.190]  Fuck me.
[19:32.850 --> 19:34.110]  There was sheep in the way?
[19:35.170 --> 19:36.170]  What is that?
[19:36.270 --> 19:37.610]  Uh oh! Ah, damn it!
[19:38.490 --> 19:40.250]  That doesn't matter. There's nowhere I can go.
[19:40.370 --> 19:42.830]  I have to reposition entirely to make this shit work.
[19:44.590 --> 19:45.070]  There we go.
[19:45.150 --> 19:47.630]  Alright, well that sucks an asshole.
[19:51.590 --> 19:52.250]  Uh oh!
[19:53.970 --> 19:58.110]  Oh, you motherfucking...
[20:01.030 --> 20:02.510]  Eric, you piece of shit!
[20:02.510 --> 20:04.270]  I didn't do anything, Nick.
[20:04.270 --> 20:04.530]  No!
[20:05.870 --> 20:07.370]  Run it on Nick!
[20:07.730 --> 20:09.610]  You real piece of shit, sheep!
[20:11.690 --> 20:12.690]  20 seconds!
[20:13.510 --> 20:14.650]  Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!
[20:15.390 --> 20:16.110]  Where is he?
[20:17.110 --> 20:17.670]  You!
[20:19.630 --> 20:21.090]  Miss, miss, miss!
[20:21.410 --> 20:22.170]  Stop, stop, stop!
[20:24.390 --> 20:24.950]  Yes!
[20:25.830 --> 20:28.430]  6, 5, 4,
[20:28.670 --> 20:30.710]  3, 2,
[20:30.710 --> 20:31.350]  1!
[20:32.790 --> 20:32.870]  No!
[20:33.310 --> 20:33.570]  No!
[20:41.230 --> 20:42.390]  Within 4?
[20:42.910 --> 20:44.370]  Real as shit just now.
[20:47.990 --> 20:50.590]  I mean, there's only one way to go, it appears.
[20:51.410 --> 20:52.690]  And so it is!
[20:53.410 --> 20:53.710]  Oh, what?
[20:54.210 --> 20:56.130]  Uh oh.
[20:57.150 --> 20:58.090]  Oh, get in there!
[20:58.090 --> 21:00.010]  Just get in the fucking thing!
[21:01.050 --> 21:01.450]  Jesus!
[21:03.910 --> 21:04.310]  Damn!
[21:05.590 --> 21:07.590]  Let me go! Yes!
[21:07.710 --> 21:08.650]  You saved me!
[21:11.570 --> 21:13.470]  Shit, Eric, I'll kill you.
[21:15.350 --> 21:17.210]  Hey, what's up?
[21:17.330 --> 21:19.030]  We're touching tips, dude, get out of here!
[21:19.970 --> 21:20.470]  What's up, boys?
[21:20.870 --> 21:22.430]  Uh oh, the real threat has arrived.
[21:24.510 --> 21:25.990]  Oh, that really screwed me.
[21:28.090 --> 21:29.110]  That really helped me.
[21:30.230 --> 21:31.590]  Get in there, get in there.
[21:31.670 --> 21:33.010]  Oh, fuck me.
[21:33.710 --> 21:35.630]  Get in there, oh, you twat.
[21:35.690 --> 21:37.070]  Go, Nick, go!
[21:38.510 --> 21:39.270]  Oh, you missed.
[21:39.730 --> 21:40.270]  Yeah!
[21:49.020 --> 21:49.820]  Where's Nick?
[21:51.340 --> 21:52.300]  6, okay.
[21:52.880 --> 21:55.140]  Oh, you worthless twats,
[21:55.160 --> 21:56.140]  just waiting here.
[22:00.220 --> 22:01.300]  Oh, I didn't give it anything!
[22:01.660 --> 22:04.100]  I was like, I need to finish this before anyone else gets here.
[22:04.340 --> 22:05.380]  This is gonna be a nightmare.
[22:06.720 --> 22:07.160]  Whoops.
[22:08.000 --> 22:08.480]  Damn it.
[22:09.200 --> 22:10.300]  That's it, that's the money.
[22:10.660 --> 22:12.920]  I ran out of shots?
[22:17.820 --> 22:18.700]  Damn it.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.400]  Come on, baby, come on.
[22:22.700 --> 22:23.400]  Come on, come on.
[22:23.600 --> 22:25.880]  Nick is right there, Nick made it!
[22:26.200 --> 22:26.640]  Yes!
[22:26.640 --> 22:27.240]  Yes!
[22:28.020 --> 22:28.520]  Go, Gavin!
[22:30.220 --> 22:30.900]  Poof!
[22:32.320 --> 22:33.120]  Let's see.
[22:34.140 --> 22:35.500]  Oh, is it enough?
[22:35.680 --> 22:36.580]  Oh, is it enough time?
[22:36.780 --> 22:37.600]  10 seconds!
[22:38.180 --> 22:39.200]  Get in there, you twat.
[22:39.280 --> 22:46.100]  Oh, it's mighty tight now.
[22:48.260 --> 22:50.660]  Oh, concrete donkey!
[22:52.620 --> 22:53.600]  What's up, Gavin?
[22:54.060 --> 22:54.760]  Uh-oh.
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.080]  What's up, bud?
[22:57.600 --> 22:58.600]  What's up, man?
[22:59.420 --> 23:00.940]  I don't like the way Gavin said, bud.
[23:01.240 --> 23:03.320]  Piece of shit, Eric.
[23:03.580 --> 23:05.920]  You absolute asshat.
[23:06.180 --> 23:06.840]  Oh, thanks!
[23:07.400 --> 23:08.760]  Oh, did I get you over there?
[23:09.960 --> 23:11.060]  Don't worry, Geoff, I got you.
[23:11.160 --> 23:11.620]  Oh, man.
[23:12.080 --> 23:15.000]  Oh, feces!
[23:16.420 --> 23:18.240]  You fucked me royal, you did.
[23:18.940 --> 23:19.800]  Do I wanna go up?
[23:21.300 --> 23:22.480]  Past the concrete donkey?
[23:22.720 --> 23:23.160]  Or down?
[23:24.000 --> 23:24.400]  Yes!
[23:26.620 --> 23:28.020]  You wanna go past the donkey, Geoff?
[23:28.200 --> 23:28.220]  Oh.
[23:30.260 --> 23:30.660]  Donkey!
[23:32.740 --> 23:33.240]  Uh-oh.
[23:33.640 --> 23:34.140]  Uh-oh!
[23:36.080 --> 23:40.120]  Yeah, give it a lot of beans to get past the donkey.
[23:40.900 --> 23:42.500]  Takes a lot of beans to get past the donkey.
[23:46.270 --> 23:47.950]  Oh, God, there's multiple holes!
[23:50.110 --> 23:50.470]  No!
[23:55.540 --> 23:56.880]  You wanna go in the first one?
[23:57.140 --> 23:57.600]  Oh, Geoff!
[23:58.100 --> 23:58.420]  Hello.
[24:01.320 --> 24:01.620]  Uh-oh.
[24:02.180 --> 24:03.760]  A little bit too many beans there, Geoff.
[24:05.440 --> 24:05.780]  Ooh.
[24:07.680 --> 24:08.360]  Nice job, Geoff.
[24:09.480 --> 24:10.040]  Oh, no.
[24:11.240 --> 24:11.600]  Oh, no.
[24:12.880 --> 24:13.420]  Where's Eric?
[24:14.200 --> 24:15.960]  Get him! Get him! Fuck him up, Eric!
[24:16.080 --> 24:16.620]  Fuck him up!
[24:17.920 --> 24:18.850]  Yeah, Eric!
[24:19.580 --> 24:20.180]  My guy!
[24:22.220 --> 24:23.260]  Save me a stroke!
[24:24.640 --> 24:25.480]  Game sucks!
[24:29.100 --> 24:30.380]  Oh, God, there's three holes!
[24:33.140 --> 24:34.380]  Oh, Christ.
[24:40.260 --> 24:41.980]  Where are we supposed to go from here?
[24:43.520 --> 24:45.540]  I made it to the platform!
[24:46.320 --> 24:47.040]  Now what?
[24:48.720 --> 24:51.560]  I don't understand where we're supposed to go.
[24:52.820 --> 24:54.200]  Is it, like, in the middle?
[24:55.300 --> 24:56.460]  Where the hell is it?
[24:57.320 --> 24:57.500]  Oh.
[24:59.000 --> 24:59.800]  Did you find it?
[25:00.260 --> 25:00.500]  No.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.340]  It's where the green flare is.
[25:05.680 --> 25:06.220]  Up top?
[25:06.740 --> 25:07.140]  Yeah.
[25:07.400 --> 25:08.720]  I'm up here. There's nothing up here.
[25:10.620 --> 25:12.420]  I'm telling you what I see, baby.
[25:12.940 --> 25:14.580]  Oh, that? Okay, back the other way.
[25:15.320 --> 25:16.800]  Right, where the green flare is.
[25:16.900 --> 25:18.420]  There's green flares up here, Eric!
[25:19.860 --> 25:20.860]  Oh, the hole's
[25:20.860 --> 25:21.880]  directly underneath.
[25:22.540 --> 25:22.800]  Ah.
[25:27.190 --> 25:29.070]  Well, this is gonna be a fucking nightmare
[25:29.070 --> 25:30.770]  in the next minute and
[25:30.770 --> 25:32.970]  ten seconds or so.
[25:35.310 --> 25:36.450]  Really looking forward to this.
[25:36.970 --> 25:38.930]  Fucking sucking. Oh, yeah, that sucks.
[25:40.150 --> 25:41.150]  Oh, too much!
[25:41.210 --> 25:41.790]  Too much!
[25:42.810 --> 25:46.190]  Oh, I had it.
[25:46.570 --> 25:47.960]  Andrew in at five.
[25:48.770 --> 25:50.110]  Fucking Nick with three.
[25:50.830 --> 25:51.990]  Yeah, baby!
[25:52.450 --> 25:53.530]  Oh, Nick's at four.
[25:56.090 --> 25:58.090]  Nice landing, Geoff!
[25:59.480 --> 26:00.730]  God damn it.
[26:01.910 --> 26:03.630]  Stupid, stupid
[26:03.630 --> 26:05.510]  fucking deer on a stupid fucking boat.
[26:05.870 --> 26:06.950]  Geoff! Geoff!
[26:07.190 --> 26:07.310]  Ah!
[26:10.830 --> 26:12.370]  There we go. There we go.
[26:12.810 --> 26:14.630]  That was just a few
[26:15.130 --> 26:16.950]  too many bees there.
[26:19.830 --> 26:20.550]  Jesus.
[26:22.490 --> 26:23.070]  Eric's
[26:23.070 --> 26:24.030]  going to the moon.
[26:28.740 --> 26:30.100]  Oh! Oh!
[26:30.880 --> 26:31.160]  Oh!
[26:34.720 --> 26:36.480]  That's called a buzzer beater, baby!
[26:38.140 --> 26:39.240]  Oh, man.
[26:39.240 --> 26:41.000]  That was three for Gavin on that one. Insane.
[26:41.280 --> 26:41.640]  Aw.
[26:45.980 --> 26:46.860]  Oh, my God!
[26:46.940 --> 26:48.620]  Gavin landed on me. Hello.
[26:48.700 --> 26:49.500]  Oh, we all squeezed.
[26:50.880 --> 26:51.780]  Gotta get out of here!
[26:53.480 --> 26:53.960]  Wisely.
[26:55.740 --> 26:55.940]  Whoops.
[26:59.000 --> 26:59.360]  Hmm.
[27:00.060 --> 27:02.040]  How could I...
[27:02.040 --> 27:04.240]  Oh, shit.
[27:05.080 --> 27:06.640]  Gavin, you absolute
[27:07.160 --> 27:08.500]  turd. Oh, muff bags.
[27:08.500 --> 27:10.500]  Oh, God.
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.500]  Where are you guys...
[27:13.100 --> 27:14.500]  I'm not sure where the...
[27:15.120 --> 27:16.740]  Get back in the...
[27:16.740 --> 27:17.040]  Nope.
[27:18.820 --> 27:27.120]  Ah, toss pot.
[27:27.320 --> 27:27.840]  Come on!
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.080]  Too much.
[27:29.780 --> 27:30.180]  Oh!
[27:36.460 --> 27:38.740]  Why is Andrew quietly doing something?
[27:39.260 --> 27:39.660]  Fuck. Fuck.
[27:40.500 --> 27:41.480]  Damn it!
[27:45.820 --> 27:46.860]  Oh, God, Nick.
[27:47.120 --> 27:48.240]  Oh, you scared me, Gavin.
[27:49.620 --> 27:50.100]  Shit.
[27:51.260 --> 27:52.300]  In they all!
[27:55.260 --> 27:55.740]  Me!
[27:56.540 --> 27:57.500]  Ah, shit.
[27:59.320 --> 28:00.580]  Ooh, in at nine.
[28:01.240 --> 28:01.460]  Uh-oh.
[28:03.520 --> 28:04.660]  Should I just do the...
[28:04.660 --> 28:07.380]  No, not enough! More beans! More beans
[28:07.380 --> 28:08.620]  than you think! Too many.
[28:09.060 --> 28:11.400]  Not enough beans. Not enough beans possible.
[28:11.640 --> 28:12.840]  Fuck. I had it.
[28:12.840 --> 28:14.860]  I had it.
[28:16.500 --> 28:17.380]  Oh, Jesus.
[28:17.640 --> 28:18.680]  Whenever Eric is there,
[28:18.820 --> 28:20.220]  and there's like a moment...
[28:20.740 --> 28:22.080]  Oh, my God. Just eat it out!
[28:22.580 --> 28:24.200]  Alright, Geoff, one last great hit.
[28:24.600 --> 28:26.400]  Take it home. You got it, buddy. I got it.
[28:27.100 --> 28:28.740]  It's gonna be perfect just
[28:28.740 --> 28:29.460]  like this.
[28:30.440 --> 28:31.180]  Great shot!
[28:33.700 --> 28:34.900]  One last great shot.
[28:34.940 --> 28:36.340]  Right here, Geoff. That's it!
[28:36.500 --> 28:37.380]  Here comes the hole-in-one.
[28:43.140 --> 28:43.580]  Uh...
[28:44.660 --> 28:46.860]  Oh, four strokes.
[28:48.120 --> 28:48.560]  Oh...
[28:48.560 --> 28:50.640]  If Nick gets a 12 and I get a one,
[28:50.720 --> 28:52.780]  this could happen for me. Oh, my God.
[28:53.400 --> 28:55.340]  What did we...
[28:55.340 --> 28:57.020]  Okay. I think the odds
[28:57.020 --> 28:58.840]  of that are...
[28:59.880 --> 29:01.220]  Oh, I missed!
[29:03.800 --> 29:05.060]  I got too fired up.
[29:05.220 --> 29:06.940]  Yeah, you did. Holy shit, you scared me.
[29:09.920 --> 29:10.920]  I don't know
[29:10.920 --> 29:12.040]  where I'm going
[29:13.040 --> 29:14.820]  or what I'm supposed to do.
[29:16.000 --> 29:16.480]  Well...
[29:16.480 --> 29:18.720]  Oh, that's...
[29:18.720 --> 29:19.320]  Oh, that was it.
[29:20.540 --> 29:22.560]  Ah! Whoa! Hey, now.
[29:23.760 --> 29:24.680]  You're an all-star.
[29:25.060 --> 29:25.940]  Get your game on.
[29:27.560 --> 29:28.680]  Nope, nope, yep. Okay.
[29:28.820 --> 29:30.400]  I missed it! No!
[29:31.780 --> 29:32.740]  Let's see...
[29:32.740 --> 29:34.160]  I see you.
[29:34.520 --> 29:36.300]  I see you.
[29:37.880 --> 29:38.860]  Oh, my God. It's like
[29:38.860 --> 29:40.880]  Eric is hunting me across the plane.
[29:43.260 --> 29:44.700]  Oh, you idiot.
[29:46.820 --> 29:48.480]  Love the bomb! Yes!
[29:49.140 --> 29:49.960]  Love the bomb!
[29:51.660 --> 29:52.940]  Hurry up, bomb!
[29:54.460 --> 29:54.880]  God!
[29:55.900 --> 29:57.020]  Keep missing!
[29:58.060 --> 29:58.680]  Oh, God.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.180]  If I run out of time...
[30:01.180 --> 30:01.940]  Keep missing!
[30:03.160 --> 30:03.720]  Oh!
[30:04.100 --> 30:06.220]  Oh, yes!
[30:07.860 --> 30:09.700]  You saved me!
[30:13.800 --> 30:14.560]  No!
[30:18.180 --> 30:19.820]  He's... Look at his face.
[30:19.840 --> 30:20.780]  He's seen hell.
[30:23.740 --> 30:25.800]  Hey! We did it, boys.
[30:26.660 --> 30:26.880]  Oh!
[30:27.520 --> 30:29.580]  Good game, Nick. Good game.
[30:29.600 --> 30:30.240]  What a game.
[30:31.600 --> 30:31.980]  Damn.
[30:33.140 --> 30:33.980]  Oh, I got a human.
[30:34.100 --> 30:35.260]  Worms course. Pretty good.
[30:35.460 --> 30:36.460]  That was fun. Oh, yeah.
