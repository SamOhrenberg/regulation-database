[00:00.000 --> 00:06.760]  Are we live? Do we have to record? Gavin, go ahead. What? Yeah, Gavin, go ahead. Gavin, lead!
[00:08.280 --> 00:13.900]  Take the reins, Gavin! Why did you ask if we started recording? We did a countdown and everything.
[00:14.160 --> 00:18.860]  Just make... oh, so we did. Good. Gavin, you were going to say? Oh, welcome to a Makeway
[00:18.860 --> 00:24.900]  five-player sponsored stream. That's true! Thank you so much for sponsoring this stream. Nice
[00:24.900 --> 00:29.400]  beam and secret mode. We're playing Makeway and it's six players now! We can all play! Wow!
[00:30.300 --> 00:35.800]  Which is great! So this game is on Steam and you can play it on Steam. We've played this game
[00:35.800 --> 00:42.180]  a lot in... You found this game, Eric, for us. Yeah, this has been a really fun game. It's like,
[00:42.240 --> 00:50.140]  what if Chicken Horse was Cars, Micro Machines style? Too many piss rats. Can we get less piss
[00:50.140 --> 00:54.240]  rats in the chat, please? More corn cats, maybe? More corn cats. That'd actually be good if it was
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.600]  more corn cats. A lot of first-time chatters. Drown out the corn with piss. Piss on the corn,
[00:58.600 --> 01:03.680]  please. No, don't piss on the corn. Don't piss on the corn. As you do. No, come on. Too many
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.880]  piss rats. But, guys, it is time to take this game to the next level because they added six
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.220]  players. You can have up to six. We even have AI fill in that sixth slot. I don't want to. I just
[01:13.220 --> 01:22.680]  want it to be us. It's the boys! So we join all five. Are you guys ready to play this game?
[01:23.080 --> 01:28.060]  Before we start, did you guys know that it's for six players? I just want to make sure that you
[01:28.700 --> 01:39.540]  know, right? It's six people. Yeah. I mean, I know now. Let it be known that Gavin stopped holding
[01:39.540 --> 01:45.860]  out on us about this six-player make. The match will start very soon, but if we have a mod in the
[01:45.860 --> 01:51.120]  chat and we want to get some bets going, I think everyone can bet some regulation points. And I
[01:51.120 --> 01:57.900]  think that's the fun of having the competitive games going, is getting some bets. I bet, of
[01:57.900 --> 02:04.120]  course, pretty sweet at 5.01 p.m. today, Friday, the best. Appreciate it. Appreciate everyone who's
[02:04.120 --> 02:11.120]  dropping the gift subs and the resubscriptions. Let's do it. It's time. It's time. It's Vader
[02:11.120 --> 02:17.500]  time. Let's pick something. Oh, my God. Crumple Zone. Thunder Milk Truck. Dude, I'm going to...
[02:17.500 --> 02:24.340]  Ooh, we got a lot. Where did my bet go? I think I'm going to go with Crumple Zone.
[02:24.760 --> 02:29.020]  That's a pretty cool car. It's like you're about to go on a cross-country vacation.
[02:29.280 --> 02:35.640]  Do with this blue. Staple your grandma to the roof, right? Yep. Definitely. Put the dog on the
[02:36.340 --> 02:40.940]  back. Just tie him up to it. It's good. Yeah. Geoff, did you... Everyone picked? We all good? Oh,
[02:40.980 --> 02:45.300]  my God. We got it. All right, guys, we're playing at City Skylines or whatever the level's called.
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.560]  I'm excited. I want to be in the game. That's a different game, I think. Oh, okay. Whoa.
[02:50.560 --> 02:57.820]  Ooh, fun stuff. What kind of fun thing? No obstacles. Oh, there was some obstacles.
[02:58.260 --> 03:03.020]  Was there? I jumped in on that immediately. Don't you worry, Gavin. I got you. Oh, my God.
[03:03.120 --> 03:08.960]  I know what you want. Do we have shortcuts on? Shortcuts are on. Yes. Oh, yeah. So we have...
[03:08.960 --> 03:12.300]  You have the ability to do all that stuff. You can get this game on Steam. Everyone can
[03:12.300 --> 03:15.800]  go get this game on Steam. I recommend it. It's fun as hell. I love this game.
[03:16.920 --> 03:26.020]  Five people. Yeah, this is too many. This is insane. Oh, no. I'm in the gap.
[03:31.320 --> 03:36.040]  Stupid milk truck. We hate the milk truck. I won't die. I won't die. I have to deliver the
[03:36.040 --> 03:42.560]  milk to the little boys and girls. Milk man here. Milk, milk, milk. Milk McLemonade. Damn it.
[03:43.340 --> 03:51.440]  I got no points that whole way. No, I did terrible. We can also set it so the number reach to win
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.580]  is changed. I have it at 4000, which is what it was before. Maybe consider setting it to 500.
[03:56.820 --> 04:04.440]  That would have been cool. And Geoff wins again. Damn it. No. We're going back, baby.
[04:05.420 --> 04:10.920]  We are going back. Oh, this is crazy. It's your kids, Marty. They're assholes.
[04:14.580 --> 04:20.320]  Grimorg, thank you. Five gifted. This is great. Grimorg. Grimorg. Appreciate everyone watching.
[04:22.020 --> 04:27.620]  I always like it when a company makes a game that we've actually played before and then decides to
[04:27.620 --> 04:32.760]  sponsor us. Yeah, it's so cool. It's actually a game that we play and it wasn't the worst thing
[04:32.760 --> 04:43.680]  that happened to the brand. Geoff, no, no, no. Oh that milkman is a chevin. Jesus, let me live.
[04:43.840 --> 04:50.860]  Geoff, the bastard man. I'm all milked up, baby. Oh, no, not like that. Full of vitamin dickhead.
[04:51.720 --> 04:57.900]  God damn it. Oh my God. Smash them all the way through. No, no, no. Hold, hold, hold. Dude,
[04:59.520 --> 05:02.740]  I think I got a Geoff win out of that. Let's see, 500?
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.620]  Did I get 500? Rats, if you bet on me, I'm very sorry. No, I think I won. What?
[05:09.180 --> 05:14.660]  Haru not said this is a five-player game? My friend, it's up to a six-player game. Yeah, we just only have five friends.
[05:15.380 --> 05:16.480]  I don't know, is that remove something?
[05:17.440 --> 05:23.700]  Unfortunately, we don't, there's not one other person that likes us. You go ahead first. Thank God, get it out of here.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.360]  Go low, Geoff, go low.
[05:26.260 --> 05:26.620]  No!
[05:28.580 --> 05:31.520]  Honestly, get it out of here. Is it better like this, or like, okay. Get real.
[05:33.200 --> 05:35.020]  Well, see how this is gonna go.
[05:37.900 --> 05:40.880]  Me and Geoff are in a battle. Oh no, Gavin!
[05:42.860 --> 05:46.140]  I can't get my stuff taken away. Oh, did you?
[05:46.660 --> 05:53.880]  No! Oh, come on. Oh, I can't believe I made that. Oh my god, my own thing!
[05:54.420 --> 05:55.200]  Oh, get up!
[06:02.260 --> 06:04.900]  Oh, don't you touch me, you little bastard!
[06:06.200 --> 06:09.040]  Oh my god, oh my god, guys!
[06:09.920 --> 06:11.000]  Let me win!
[06:12.460 --> 06:13.280]  This sucks!
[06:14.720 --> 06:15.120]  No!
[06:15.800 --> 06:16.060]  No!
[06:16.980 --> 06:17.400]  No!
[06:18.420 --> 06:19.700]  Shit salad!
[06:21.480 --> 06:23.960]  Oh no! Shortcut! Shortcut!
[06:23.980 --> 06:24.420]  I'm panicking!
[06:24.420 --> 06:25.180]  I'm panicking!
[06:25.180 --> 06:25.740]  Yes!
[06:26.780 --> 06:27.400]  No!
[06:28.160 --> 06:30.420]  Die, you little asshole, die!
[06:30.660 --> 06:32.300]  This car controls so bad!
[06:32.800 --> 06:33.860]  Go up the ledge!
[06:34.740 --> 06:35.780]  Fire it! Hit the turbo!
[06:36.240 --> 06:38.480]  I did it! Son of a bitch!
[06:38.740 --> 06:39.500]  Rat points!
[06:40.560 --> 06:43.680]  Wait, you hadn't gotten a single point in this round?
[06:43.960 --> 06:45.040]  No! No, I hadn't!
[06:45.160 --> 06:46.740]  I kept getting blasted off!
[06:48.660 --> 06:50.820]  The concentration from Andrew.
[06:52.700 --> 06:54.200]  Pick it up, Andrew.
[06:55.740 --> 06:56.220]  Andrew?
[06:56.700 --> 06:57.620]  There we go.
[06:58.080 --> 06:59.080]  I'm just making sure you're okay.
[06:59.500 --> 07:02.680]  I'm good. I'm putting down barriers.
[07:03.260 --> 07:04.840]  I'm burying this up.
[07:05.860 --> 07:06.140]  What?
[07:07.020 --> 07:07.520]  I don't know.
[07:07.560 --> 07:10.340]  I keep panicking and thinking I'm one of the other cars.
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.240]  Did everybody have a good week?
[07:13.220 --> 07:13.780]  I had a great week.
[07:13.920 --> 07:16.320]  It was busy. Today was really busy. It was good.
[07:16.740 --> 07:18.740]  I agree. It was an incredibly busy week,
[07:18.740 --> 07:19.920]  but it felt like a great week.
[07:20.240 --> 07:22.580]  In and out of work. I got a lot of personal stuff handled, too.
[07:22.960 --> 07:25.560]  But man, did we get a lot of stuff recorded this week, huh?
[07:25.680 --> 07:26.080]  Yeah, it was pretty good.
[07:26.080 --> 07:27.960]  I feel like this is one of those weeks when you
[07:28.940 --> 07:30.620]  know you made like three or four things
[07:30.620 --> 07:32.200]  that are just gonna kill.
[07:32.400 --> 07:33.660]  Oh! Ah, shit!
[07:34.700 --> 07:35.640]  Yeah, it's just good stuff.
[07:36.680 --> 07:39.040]  I was just swinging for the fences.
[07:39.060 --> 07:39.780]  What are you doing?
[07:44.260 --> 07:44.580]  Waaah!
[07:45.460 --> 07:47.380]  Why am I sideways, son of a bitch?
[07:47.380 --> 07:49.460]  I had the exact same thing happen.
[07:50.580 --> 07:52.740]  There we go. That's what I'm talking about.
[07:53.100 --> 07:54.980]  The rats come out and I win!
[07:55.840 --> 07:56.620]  You idiot!
[07:57.360 --> 07:58.200]  Yeah, you idiot.
[07:58.920 --> 07:59.580]  Yeah, you idiot.
[08:00.760 --> 08:01.860]  Sorry, Geoff. I shot you.
[08:01.980 --> 08:03.660]  No, it's okay. I still scored. Gavin fucked me.
[08:03.720 --> 08:04.560]  What is happening?
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.700]  Oh, you pushed me on!
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.120]  Thanks! Holy shit!
[08:12.500 --> 08:13.740]  I went further
[08:13.740 --> 08:14.920]  and then I went...
[08:14.920 --> 08:16.880]  Yeah, people died
[08:16.880 --> 08:18.640]  for our decision, Gavin.
[08:18.980 --> 08:21.640]  Oh, I tried to do the same thing!
[08:22.280 --> 08:23.200]  Oh, what a little...
[08:24.100 --> 08:25.400]  Is this backwards?
[08:25.820 --> 08:26.440]  Oh, sick.
[08:27.380 --> 08:28.620]  Gavin, you get the win!
[08:29.040 --> 08:30.080]  I got real turned around.
[08:31.420 --> 08:32.560]  Wow, this is an even game.
[08:32.660 --> 08:33.700]  Mike Dorm.
[08:34.740 --> 08:37.400]  My 11 pound cat is laying on my shoulders
[08:37.400 --> 08:39.360]  like a scarf while I sit at my desk.
[08:39.600 --> 08:40.780]  Thanks for the subscription.
[08:41.480 --> 08:42.400]  Weird message.
[08:42.940 --> 08:44.420]  No, that's a great message.
[08:45.400 --> 08:46.720]  I agree, it's a great message.
[08:46.860 --> 08:48.280]  And thanks for feeling safe enough
[08:48.280 --> 08:49.060]  to share it with us.
[08:50.960 --> 08:51.360]  No!
[08:52.720 --> 08:53.820]  You gotta be fast.
[08:54.700 --> 08:55.100]  There.
[08:56.020 --> 08:57.240]  I'm happy to be last.
[08:59.500 --> 09:00.680]  Tankadelphia in the chat.
[09:00.780 --> 09:02.420]  Where's Mark the Frog? I have an egg dilemma.
[09:05.780 --> 09:08.100]  Oh, look at Gavin making everything more difficult.
[09:08.100 --> 09:09.460]  I thought the...
[09:10.280 --> 09:11.960]  I thought the videos we filmed this morning
[09:11.960 --> 09:12.720]  were pretty cool too.
[09:13.320 --> 09:15.360]  I guess series now, right?
[09:15.580 --> 09:16.220]  Yeah, hopefully.
[09:17.640 --> 09:18.500]  They were a lot of fun.
[09:19.060 --> 09:20.180]  No one knocked me off this round.
[09:20.640 --> 09:22.160]  Oh, okay. You got it.
[09:25.220 --> 09:26.640]  Well, somebody had a hammer.
[09:26.980 --> 09:27.620]  No, no, no!
[09:28.020 --> 09:28.780]  God damn it!
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.640]  You piece of shit Jack!
[09:32.760 --> 09:33.560]  Go rats!
[09:34.000 --> 09:34.800]  Piece of shit who?
[09:34.800 --> 09:35.780]  Geoff, why'd you do it?
[09:35.800 --> 09:38.000]  I didn't do anything, man! What are you talking about?
[09:38.080 --> 09:39.760]  You crashed into me and killed me!
[09:39.820 --> 09:41.320]  No, you crashed into me and killed me.
[09:41.940 --> 09:44.640]  But I wasn't over here blaming you about it.
[09:45.300 --> 09:46.780]  I'm sideways again!
[09:50.120 --> 09:52.300]  No, I was there!
[09:52.500 --> 09:53.320]  It's a lie!
[09:54.140 --> 09:55.920]  Who did that to me?
[09:58.700 --> 09:59.140]  Shortcut!
[09:59.860 --> 10:00.460]  Oh, shortcut.
[10:00.460 --> 10:02.860]  Where did I...
[10:02.860 --> 10:06.760]  I keep getting killed by...
[10:06.760 --> 10:07.600]  Did we make it?
[10:07.920 --> 10:09.740]  No, no one finished.
[10:11.160 --> 10:12.800]  You gotta turn around again, eh?
[10:13.820 --> 10:14.140]  Shortcut!
[10:14.440 --> 10:16.460]  Get out of the way dickhead!
[10:17.620 --> 10:17.760]  No!
[10:26.540 --> 10:27.180]  Shortcut!
[10:27.180 --> 10:27.740]  Time to charm!
[10:29.660 --> 10:30.160]  Damn!
[10:30.720 --> 10:31.220]  No!
[10:33.620 --> 10:36.040]  What if we just did it the right way?
[10:36.440 --> 10:36.740]  Shut up!
[10:40.740 --> 10:42.180]  Shut up is right.
[10:42.500 --> 10:44.640]  Oh, it didn't skip it? It automatically skipped it for you?
[10:44.780 --> 10:46.420]  Yes! No!
[10:46.760 --> 10:47.680]  I lived!
[10:48.500 --> 10:49.000]  Hello!
[10:51.560 --> 10:52.800]  How did you live?
[10:53.200 --> 10:54.740]  I'm good. I'm real good.
[10:55.320 --> 10:55.840]  Goodbye!
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.100]  What happened to me? I exploded at the gate!
[10:59.680 --> 11:01.060]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
[11:01.100 --> 11:02.600]  Rats! Where are my rats at?
[11:02.920 --> 11:03.080]  Woo!
[11:03.900 --> 11:04.420]  Power!
[11:06.220 --> 11:07.120]  Stop him!
[11:09.340 --> 11:10.380]  Come on!
[11:10.500 --> 11:11.100]  Take that Geoff!
[11:12.540 --> 11:14.340]  Geoff the bastard, man!
[11:14.600 --> 11:16.540]  I didn't do nothing! Rats!
[11:16.960 --> 11:18.500]  That was a bad run for Gabby.
[11:19.040 --> 11:20.520]  It always comes up rats, baby.
[11:21.140 --> 11:22.920]  I got no points that time.
[11:22.920 --> 11:23.440]  I'm going rough.
[11:23.600 --> 11:24.120]  Come on!
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.500]  Come back!
[11:27.240 --> 11:30.180]  Yeah! Not in last!
[11:30.700 --> 11:30.840]  Woo!
[11:32.320 --> 11:33.540]  This is a tight...
[11:34.580 --> 11:35.520]  Ah, shit!
[11:37.380 --> 11:38.300]  Ah, yeah!
[11:41.360 --> 11:42.300]  Oh, God.
[11:42.940 --> 11:43.740]  Let's see if I can do anything.
[11:43.940 --> 11:45.260]  Where's the front?
[11:46.900 --> 11:48.040]  I'm fixing it!
[11:48.580 --> 11:49.980]  Look at the back and turn around.
[11:50.540 --> 11:52.380]  Is this chaos mode or regular mode?
[11:52.440 --> 11:53.380]  I can't remember. This is chaos.
[11:54.380 --> 11:55.980]  Scoob Drew, 5 gifted.
[11:56.200 --> 11:57.540]  Thank you.
[11:57.840 --> 11:59.040]  Thank you so much, Scoob Drew.
[12:01.220 --> 12:01.840]  Oh, what?
[12:02.000 --> 12:02.900]  I'm starting in a different position.
[12:02.940 --> 12:05.360]  Yeah, because you changed positions. I'm in third. I'm in the middle.
[12:05.940 --> 12:06.980]  Ah, that checks out.
[12:08.400 --> 12:09.640]  Ah, I'll stop.
[12:10.500 --> 12:10.920]  No!
[12:12.900 --> 12:13.320]  Holy...
[12:13.320 --> 12:14.480]  Ah, you're shooting a man.
[12:14.900 --> 12:15.920]  I sure am.
[12:15.920 --> 12:16.320]  Ah!
[12:19.360 --> 12:20.120]  Ah!
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.400]  I got...
[12:23.860 --> 12:26.540]  I watched you run around a little bit there.
[12:26.940 --> 12:27.000]  I got the sillies.
[12:27.240 --> 12:28.880]  You were like twitching in your own hand.
[12:29.260 --> 12:30.580]  Ah! I'm backwards again.
[12:31.360 --> 12:31.800]  Dab!
[12:32.740 --> 12:35.560]  That's what happens when you're one of Mrs. Brown's boys.
[12:36.700 --> 12:37.460]  No!
[12:38.420 --> 12:39.620]  God damn you.
[12:41.760 --> 12:43.580]  Just get turned around instantly.
[12:44.340 --> 12:44.860]  Shortcut!
[12:45.280 --> 12:46.360]  No, I went through the middle!
[12:47.700 --> 12:48.200]  Give me that!
[12:48.420 --> 12:50.900]  How are you alive?
[12:51.160 --> 12:52.080]  Damn it.
[12:52.420 --> 12:53.040]  You made the shortcut.
[12:53.720 --> 12:56.960]  There's nothing more jarring than the field makes you take a shortcut
[12:56.960 --> 12:58.600]  by side-swiping you into it.
[12:58.780 --> 12:59.240]  I love it.
[12:59.780 --> 13:04.260]  Come on!
[13:04.740 --> 13:05.260]  I'm alive!
[13:05.400 --> 13:06.100]  I'm alive!
[13:08.580 --> 13:09.100]  Spin!
[13:09.880 --> 13:11.100]  Stop touching me!
[13:11.800 --> 13:12.680]  Get it!
[13:16.620 --> 13:17.500]  Oh no!
[13:19.620 --> 13:20.900]  Eric, just calm down.
[13:21.380 --> 13:22.420]  Oh, just calm down, Eric.
[13:22.560 --> 13:24.180]  Don't get in front of me.
[13:24.460 --> 13:25.980]  What did I say?
[13:26.340 --> 13:28.480]  What did I say?
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.380]  I didn't get in front of you!
[13:32.480 --> 13:33.340]  That was perfect.
[13:34.960 --> 13:35.400]  Okay.
[13:35.620 --> 13:36.400]  Alright. It's okay.
[13:36.540 --> 13:37.240]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[13:37.240 --> 13:38.200]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[13:39.480 --> 13:40.920]  There's too much space.
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.300]  He killed me intentionally, you worthless dickhead.
[13:46.580 --> 13:47.680]  Why would you do that?
[13:48.540 --> 13:48.900]  Gavin!
[13:49.520 --> 13:51.240]  He did it!
[13:53.640 --> 13:59.360]  Die, dickheads.
[13:59.920 --> 14:01.100]  Where's the track?
[14:01.400 --> 14:02.300]  Show me the track!
[14:02.300 --> 14:02.460]  What was that?
[14:05.860 --> 14:07.500]  Someone trot on my front!
[14:07.880 --> 14:09.000]  Why am I backwards?
[14:09.940 --> 14:10.760]  Why am I...
[14:12.880 --> 14:13.920]  Come on!
[14:14.240 --> 14:15.380]  I need the points.
[14:15.720 --> 14:16.840]  Come back in a century.
[14:17.720 --> 14:19.360]  BlakeRookieGames, thank you so much.
[14:25.680 --> 14:27.020]  Keep going, Milky.
[14:27.140 --> 14:28.040]  Oh, it's close.
[14:28.580 --> 14:29.620]  Oh, this is...
[14:29.620 --> 14:31.200]  Still that cup of...
[14:31.200 --> 14:31.360]  Crazy.
[14:33.300 --> 14:35.300]  Bone-densifying vitamin D, baby.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.460]  Let's add a little bit, huh?
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.320]  What did I pick? I didn't even see it.
[14:40.300 --> 14:40.720]  You know what?
[14:41.620 --> 14:42.360]  You guys are adding?
[14:42.540 --> 14:43.360]  I'm going to take away.
[14:44.140 --> 14:45.540]  Are you subtracting from the mix?
[14:46.960 --> 14:49.580]  She just subtracted the thing I just put down.
[14:50.160 --> 14:51.620]  And a little bit of...
[14:52.420 --> 14:52.680]  Yeah.
[14:54.900 --> 14:55.780]  What the hell was that?
[14:55.880 --> 14:56.260]  I don't know.
[14:56.260 --> 14:56.800]  Oh, that was something.
[14:57.560 --> 14:59.000]  Why are there only four people?
[14:59.440 --> 15:01.180]  I got dropped from the game!
[15:01.520 --> 15:02.660]  Come on, man!
[15:03.180 --> 15:06.320]  I didn't do anything. I think Nick removed me with his ability.
[15:06.860 --> 15:07.780]  Can you rejoin?
[15:08.220 --> 15:09.000]  I gotta rejoin.
[15:10.400 --> 15:11.600]  Yeah, rejoin real fast.
[15:12.020 --> 15:13.580]  It should be like this in shit and everything, right?
[15:13.680 --> 15:14.440]  Oh, my God.
[15:15.980 --> 15:17.300]  Classic gizmo. You're right.
[15:17.480 --> 15:18.000]  Didn't need that.
[15:19.180 --> 15:21.880]  That was a gizmo move if there ever was one.
[15:25.930 --> 15:26.510]  Ah, no!
[15:26.630 --> 15:27.110]  No, no, no!
[15:28.030 --> 15:29.710]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[15:29.750 --> 15:30.750]  Open the key!
[15:32.990 --> 15:33.910]  Now, here's the thing.
[15:33.990 --> 15:35.230]  Andrew got dropped from the game,
[15:35.390 --> 15:37.850]  and so I feel like whoever wins
[15:37.850 --> 15:39.430]  is going to be like, oh, this is under protest.
[15:39.610 --> 15:41.410]  And so it means less, and that sucks.
[15:41.950 --> 15:43.050]  Because I'm going to win the whole
[15:43.610 --> 15:44.250]  fucking thing.
[15:44.270 --> 15:45.950]  You're not winning a thing at all.
[15:46.870 --> 15:47.630]  Oh, God!
[15:48.130 --> 15:50.290]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[15:51.610 --> 15:53.110]  Come back in a century, baby.
[15:53.430 --> 15:53.830]  Woo!
[15:54.090 --> 15:54.690]  Oh, no, I died.
[15:54.990 --> 15:55.130]  Where am I?
[15:58.050 --> 16:01.230]  Andrew, you able to join again or what?
[16:01.610 --> 16:03.070]  I'm working on it.
[16:03.170 --> 16:03.370]  Okay.
[16:07.730 --> 16:08.330]  Hi-ya!
[16:08.490 --> 16:10.430]  Get out of the way, you worthless dicks!
[16:10.650 --> 16:11.490]  Did I not make it?
[16:11.850 --> 16:12.670]  Gavin made it!
[16:12.850 --> 16:13.870]  Oh, come on!
[16:13.970 --> 16:14.910]  How did you make it?
[16:15.790 --> 16:17.250]  I thought you were driving straight.
[16:17.250 --> 16:18.430]  Eh.
[16:19.770 --> 16:19.970]  Eh.
[16:20.270 --> 16:22.170]  Just making little noises.
[16:22.590 --> 16:23.530]  I've got to concentrate.
[16:24.150 --> 16:26.010]  Yeah, concentrate on that, bitch.
[16:28.210 --> 16:29.630]  I just want to live.
[16:29.950 --> 16:30.230]  No.
[16:31.370 --> 16:32.190]  No deal!
[16:35.030 --> 16:36.510]  Oh, get busy dying!
[16:36.670 --> 16:37.410]  Immediately knocked me off.
[16:37.630 --> 16:39.770]  I got absolutely wanged!
[16:44.250 --> 16:45.130]  Oh, no!
[16:45.890 --> 16:47.010]  Instantly wanged again.
[16:47.230 --> 16:48.490]  What is going on?
[16:48.790 --> 16:50.510]  You guys have to get some milk.
[16:50.950 --> 16:53.610]  I'm just trying to give people strong bones and a healthy smile.
[16:53.810 --> 16:54.390]  Ah, shit.
[16:55.110 --> 16:55.950]  Goodbye, Gavin.
[16:57.070 --> 16:59.150]  Where did I even come back again?
[16:59.310 --> 16:59.830]  Damn it!
[17:00.450 --> 17:02.370]  You're going to have to tell us if you came.
[17:04.010 --> 17:05.710]  I end up saying that every time we play this game.
[17:05.910 --> 17:08.190]  It's like a high probability come game.
[17:10.730 --> 17:13.030]  Oh, my God, I got annihilated.
[17:13.030 --> 17:14.810]  I got blasted.
[17:15.410 --> 17:15.990]  Listen.
[17:16.230 --> 17:19.210]  I knew I was going, so someone was coming with me.
[17:21.270 --> 17:22.050]  Don't worry.
[17:22.590 --> 17:23.170]  No!
[17:23.790 --> 17:24.170]  No!
[17:26.590 --> 17:28.290]  Don't worry about my voice.
[17:29.330 --> 17:30.190]  Yes, I made it!
[17:30.690 --> 17:30.990]  Touch me!
[17:31.430 --> 17:31.630]  Touch me!
[17:33.910 --> 17:34.930]  I need this!
[17:36.950 --> 17:37.570]  Oh, no!
[17:38.790 --> 17:40.030]  Too bad it doesn't count.
[17:40.830 --> 17:42.110]  Yeah, we'll have to go back.
[17:49.850 --> 17:52.550]  You should have to spell milk with a B as well.
[17:52.930 --> 17:53.550]  Yeah, that's true.
[17:53.550 --> 17:54.350]  Where would the B go?
[17:54.670 --> 17:56.030]  At the end. It's a silent B.
[17:56.250 --> 17:57.670]  Oh, my God, Gavin!
[17:59.170 --> 18:01.650]  I do not have the ability to...
[18:01.650 --> 18:02.030]  Invite?
[18:04.110 --> 18:05.610]  Let's see this one through.
[18:05.910 --> 18:07.790]  Yeah, I'll sync up on the next one.
[18:07.790 --> 18:09.790]  Because we're already so deep into this.
[18:11.110 --> 18:11.350]  Deep.
[18:14.310 --> 18:15.390]  Love in the shortcuts.
[18:15.450 --> 18:17.130]  Go ahead, Geoff.
[18:17.370 --> 18:17.870]  There we go.
[18:18.910 --> 18:19.450]  You did?
[18:23.070 --> 18:23.990]  You go ahead and go.
[18:24.730 --> 18:25.610]  Okay, I did.
[18:25.850 --> 18:26.090]  Good.
[18:26.830 --> 18:27.170]  Good.
[18:28.770 --> 18:29.670]  Fine, then.
[18:30.910 --> 18:31.870]  What is Gavin?
[18:32.750 --> 18:34.250]  Oh, my God, you're insane!
[18:34.250 --> 18:36.250]  Well, you know.
[18:39.550 --> 18:42.390]  Gotta cool down these machines.
[18:42.590 --> 18:43.810]  My controller isn't working!
[18:45.330 --> 18:46.350]  Mine is.
[18:46.690 --> 18:48.130]  I clicked out of the window.
[18:48.430 --> 18:49.530]  Oh, God damn it.
[18:49.970 --> 18:51.510]  You've killed me, milk.
[18:52.010 --> 18:53.190]  Bye-bye.
[18:56.290 --> 18:57.950]  Come and get it!
[18:57.950 --> 18:58.950]  Come and get it!
[19:01.930 --> 19:03.810]  What a hellhole that ended up being.
[19:04.050 --> 19:06.630]  If you hit one of those bouncies, you are toast.
[19:06.810 --> 19:07.190]  You're done.
[19:09.590 --> 19:11.230]  Well, Geoff?
[19:11.810 --> 19:12.930]  Okay, we're both alive, Geoff.
[19:16.010 --> 19:17.150]  We're both dead, Geoff.
[19:17.470 --> 19:17.930]  Rats!
[19:19.250 --> 19:21.790]  Well, that's a mess.
[19:22.250 --> 19:23.530]  Careful of those two things there.
[19:28.370 --> 19:28.770]  Brutal.
[19:30.890 --> 19:33.630]  I'm begging y'all to stop touching me on the entry.
[19:33.790 --> 19:34.430]  That sounded weird.
[19:43.790 --> 19:46.210]  Gavin is making short work of us on this one, man.
[19:46.750 --> 19:47.930]  You just gotta do the shortcut.
[19:50.250 --> 19:51.210]  Tell him, Geoff.
[19:52.190 --> 19:53.450]  Is that what he sounds like?
[19:53.450 --> 19:54.610]  How's that shortcut, you bitch?
[19:55.430 --> 19:57.450]  Yeah, you did it. Well done.
[20:03.150 --> 20:04.030]  Shotgun blasted!
[20:04.250 --> 20:05.290]  Didn't even make it to the end!
[20:06.310 --> 20:07.210]  Oh, the gauze!
[20:07.470 --> 20:08.170]  The gauze!
[20:09.150 --> 20:11.390]  My fucking dumbass friend's in a text chain
[20:11.390 --> 20:13.090]  just texting me non-stop right now.
[20:13.210 --> 20:14.010]  Are you streaming?
[20:14.550 --> 20:15.570]  That's what they texted you.
[20:15.570 --> 20:15.970]  Yeah.
[20:20.270 --> 20:22.210]  They drove right off.
[20:22.570 --> 20:24.430]  Watched him do it and drove right off.
[20:24.750 --> 20:25.710]  Come from the grave.
[20:27.750 --> 20:29.270]  Come from the grave.
[20:29.750 --> 20:31.710]  I didn't expect to make it, so I'm...
[20:31.710 --> 20:33.770]  I just... You're such a...
[20:33.770 --> 20:34.430]  There we go.
[20:34.690 --> 20:35.650]  Daddy's big now.
[20:38.030 --> 20:39.230]  Star Wang!
[20:39.410 --> 20:40.890]  Killing me at the beginning!
[20:42.510 --> 20:44.090]  Stop dying at the beginning.
[20:44.090 --> 20:45.750]  What is that shit?
[20:48.650 --> 20:49.010]  Stop.
[20:49.410 --> 20:50.390]  Oh god!
[20:50.570 --> 20:53.050]  How did I go?
[20:53.410 --> 20:53.950]  Wow!
[20:54.990 --> 20:56.850]  Great round for the milk.
[20:58.230 --> 20:59.650]  Milk's been killing it.
[20:59.870 --> 21:00.870]  Look at Gavin.
[21:01.050 --> 21:02.570]  Gavin's securing it right here.
[21:03.250 --> 21:04.030]  Milk, pass it on.
[21:08.890 --> 21:10.310]  I'd be going head-to-head
[21:10.310 --> 21:11.350]  with the milk!
[21:11.350 --> 21:12.010]  No.
[21:12.910 --> 21:13.810]  There you go.
[21:17.330 --> 21:18.670]  Gavin has done it.
[21:19.230 --> 21:20.890]  Congratulations, Gavin. Under protest.
[21:21.010 --> 21:22.250]  Too bad it doesn't count.
[21:22.410 --> 21:24.790]  Does not count, sadly, but a good practice round.
[21:25.270 --> 21:26.170]  Yeah, good practice round.
[21:27.270 --> 21:28.050]  Let's get
[21:29.030 --> 21:30.090]  Andrew back in here.
[21:30.830 --> 21:31.790]  Is it the same room code?
[21:31.870 --> 21:34.290]  Let me see. It's kicking us back.
[21:34.410 --> 21:36.350]  I have to go through all my level ups because I did so good.
[21:36.370 --> 21:36.950]  Ah, yes.
[21:38.470 --> 21:39.310]  There we go.
[21:39.750 --> 21:41.450]  Ooh, getting a whole bunch of new stuff.
[21:41.790 --> 21:42.510]  Oh my god.
[21:43.350 --> 21:44.050]  Ooh, cool.
[21:44.570 --> 21:45.350]  Wow, the game was just like,
[21:45.370 --> 21:47.570]  congratulations, nobody's ever had a round this good before.
[21:48.110 --> 21:49.350]  It is the same room code.
[21:49.870 --> 21:51.830]  There we go.
[21:52.310 --> 21:53.430]  Welcome back.
[21:53.650 --> 21:55.650]  Let me make a change here.
[21:55.730 --> 21:57.110]  I'm going to keep it on chaos,
[21:57.750 --> 21:59.290]  but I'm going to change the level
[21:59.290 --> 22:01.430]  to volcanic domes.
[22:01.950 --> 22:02.350]  Ooh.
[22:03.050 --> 22:04.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:04.110 --> 22:05.290]  I like it, I like it.
[22:05.490 --> 22:06.830]  I like volcanic domes.
[22:07.850 --> 22:08.950]  How do I save?
[22:09.550 --> 22:11.270]  So I just go back, make sure.
[22:12.030 --> 22:13.250]  Chaos, volcanic domes, that's it.
[22:13.650 --> 22:15.850]  When was the last time you visited a volcano, Nick?
[22:16.630 --> 22:18.170]  I don't think I've ever been to a volcano.
[22:18.510 --> 22:18.950]  Really?
[22:19.310 --> 22:20.510]  When was the last time you did, Andrew?
[22:21.270 --> 22:23.690]  ArthriticGamer, 10 gifted jumps.
[22:24.230 --> 22:26.210]  When did Resident Evil 6 come out?
[22:26.430 --> 22:28.370]  That was probably the last volcano I visited.
[22:29.070 --> 22:29.370]  Nice.
[22:29.370 --> 22:30.370]  6 or 5?
[22:30.510 --> 22:31.750]  No, 6.
[22:32.870 --> 22:33.610]  Okay, boys.
[22:33.870 --> 22:36.610]  Let's get another bet going.
[22:37.510 --> 22:38.910]  No, that's 5.
[22:39.350 --> 22:41.070]  That's 5? Are you sure about that?
[22:41.190 --> 22:41.610]  Yeah, that's 5.
[22:43.070 --> 22:43.990]  Crazy, okay.
[22:45.110 --> 22:47.150]  I'm going to go thunder style this time.
[22:47.470 --> 22:48.470]  Ooh, nice, that's cool.
[22:48.590 --> 22:49.930]  I just unlocked this guy.
[22:51.190 --> 22:52.350]  Yeah, a little alien guy.
[22:52.690 --> 22:53.750]  Alright, guys, here we go.
[22:54.430 --> 22:55.890]  Andrew, try to keep it together this time, okay?
[22:55.890 --> 22:57.330]  I'm locked in.
[22:57.990 --> 22:59.890]  Granddad Joe is going to be
[22:59.890 --> 23:01.570]  pushing everybody down.
[23:01.690 --> 23:02.670]  Don't put a fan in.
[23:03.610 --> 23:05.270]  Oh, damn, I didn't want that.
[23:06.050 --> 23:06.790]  Come on, come on, come on.
[23:07.330 --> 23:09.230]  Build the track. Yes!
[23:10.530 --> 23:11.790]  Start with a freeway.
[23:13.750 --> 23:16.310]  We're starting with a freeway every time.
[23:16.770 --> 23:17.910]  Every time we begin.
[23:17.910 --> 23:19.530]  Put some fans in this freeway at the beginning and end.
[23:19.750 --> 23:20.370]  Oh my god.
[23:21.070 --> 23:22.910]  Because it's stressful when you're driving down the freeway.
[23:22.910 --> 23:24.230]  You want to cool off a little bit.
[23:24.330 --> 23:25.230]  You want to relax.
[23:26.310 --> 23:26.830]  Smart.
[23:28.630 --> 23:30.370]  Geoff didn't seem so excited.
[23:30.950 --> 23:31.670]  Pumpkin truck.
[23:33.370 --> 23:34.230]  Excuse me!
[23:34.550 --> 23:35.630]  Oh my god!
[23:36.590 --> 23:36.790]  Ah!
[23:42.340 --> 23:43.380]  What happened?
[23:45.280 --> 23:46.280]  Did you turn off shortcuts?
[23:47.020 --> 23:47.880]  Shortcuts should be on.
[23:48.400 --> 23:49.300]  They better be on.
[23:49.820 --> 23:52.680]  Oh my god, I got brutalized.
[23:54.560 --> 23:54.680]  What?
[23:56.600 --> 23:57.980]  The shortcut's broken.
[23:58.440 --> 24:00.300]  Are you not allowed such an early shortcut?
[24:00.440 --> 24:01.200]  I don't know.
[24:02.300 --> 24:02.980]  Oh no!
[24:05.900 --> 24:06.820]  Can't speed it.
[24:06.920 --> 24:07.740]  I was only saying it.
[24:09.720 --> 24:10.780]  Let's keep it going.
[24:12.360 --> 24:12.880]  Nice.
[24:13.100 --> 24:13.560]  Good turns.
[24:14.300 --> 24:15.060]  Good drifts.
[24:16.880 --> 24:18.720]  I'm just trying to deliver these pumpkins.
[24:19.500 --> 24:19.580]  Yes!
[24:21.100 --> 24:22.740]  I had to get first for that.
[24:22.740 --> 24:23.240]  Come on!
[24:24.500 --> 24:24.800]  No!
[24:26.920 --> 24:28.120]  Not a single point.
[24:28.680 --> 24:29.840]  Let's stop this.
[24:31.300 --> 24:31.700]  Oh!
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.040]  Damn.
[24:34.820 --> 24:35.960]  There you go, Gavin.
[24:36.700 --> 24:37.440]  You got the sack?
[24:37.960 --> 24:38.400]  Yes!
[24:39.340 --> 24:41.020]  How did I get this?
[24:41.080 --> 24:42.340]  This is when I picked it all.
[24:43.080 --> 24:44.900]  What the fuck?
[24:46.100 --> 24:46.980]  Swingin' balls.
[24:47.500 --> 24:48.020]  That's fun.
[24:48.020 --> 24:48.960]  And that's fun.
[24:49.340 --> 24:50.680]  Oh my god.
[24:50.720 --> 24:53.780]  So the shortcut does not work?
[24:53.900 --> 24:54.660]  I don't know.
[24:55.060 --> 24:56.320]  Keep trying, Nick.
[24:58.380 --> 24:58.940]  No!
[25:00.500 --> 25:01.880]  This fucking freeway.
[25:02.080 --> 25:03.300]  Oh, he got tilted!
[25:03.940 --> 25:04.860]  Do you guys like the freeway?
[25:05.240 --> 25:06.720]  I love the freeway.
[25:06.900 --> 25:07.860]  The freeway sucks!
[25:10.280 --> 25:12.940]  I wonder if this is what the gumball 5000 is like.
[25:13.520 --> 25:14.420]  Oh god, the bus!
[25:14.420 --> 25:15.180]  Oh, that bus!
[25:15.180 --> 25:16.040]  Ah!
[25:16.600 --> 25:17.300]  I'm scared.
[25:18.640 --> 25:19.180]  Grand Andrew!
[25:20.920 --> 25:22.340]  I made it though!
[25:22.680 --> 25:24.900]  Okay, okay, okay.
[25:25.380 --> 25:26.160]  Alright, here we go.
[25:27.400 --> 25:29.260]  He's gonna blow this. He's gonna nick this.
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.240]  What are you talking about?
[25:31.800 --> 25:32.780]  Pull out your last of us.
[25:33.080 --> 25:34.240]  Sack me all in hell!
[25:35.700 --> 25:37.040]  Big turn, big turn.
[25:37.300 --> 25:37.420]  No!
[25:39.700 --> 25:40.200]  Oh!
[25:41.020 --> 25:42.020]  Who's doing that?
[25:42.020 --> 25:42.680]  Oh, nope.
[25:43.320 --> 25:44.840]  Is he like singing?
[25:46.240 --> 25:47.480]  Oh, what the hell?
[25:47.580 --> 25:48.560]  I died right away?
[25:51.300 --> 25:53.580]  Nick just got scattened.
[25:53.980 --> 25:56.560]  Wow, Nick got big points on that one.
[25:56.980 --> 25:57.500]  Wow!
[25:59.380 --> 25:59.960]  Monster.
[26:00.640 --> 26:01.560]  Could someone give
[26:01.560 --> 26:03.040]  granddad a point?
[26:03.320 --> 26:05.280]  Good job to Theme Chanick.
[26:07.220 --> 26:07.360]  What?
[26:07.680 --> 26:08.800]  I was just reading your name.
[26:09.260 --> 26:09.920]  Oh, thanks.
[26:12.100 --> 26:12.700]  That's me.
[26:13.640 --> 26:14.520]  Dang it.
[26:14.880 --> 26:15.580]  There we go.
[26:19.180 --> 26:21.340]  We already have a hard enough time with the freeway.
[26:21.460 --> 26:23.140]  Gavin, nobody has passed this
[26:23.140 --> 26:23.940]  except for me yet.
[26:24.440 --> 26:26.440]  Well, try that one.
[26:26.840 --> 26:27.280]  Okay.
[26:30.720 --> 26:33.220]  I'm getting all the points this time. I'm not dying once.
[26:33.620 --> 26:35.060]  No dying for me!
[26:35.720 --> 26:36.680]  No dying for me!
[26:37.200 --> 26:39.400]  I didn't even get a chance to decide
[26:39.400 --> 26:40.100]  what I was doing.
[26:40.540 --> 26:44.880]  I'm scared.
[26:45.560 --> 26:47.040]  Dumbass pumpkin truck.
[26:47.240 --> 26:48.060]  I'm scared.
[26:48.920 --> 26:49.880]  Oh my god.
[26:50.060 --> 26:50.820]  I'm scared.
[26:53.060 --> 26:54.720]  I'm not gonna make it.
[26:54.940 --> 26:56.140]  He's almost there.
[26:56.660 --> 26:59.000]  Don't stop touching me.
[26:59.520 --> 27:01.200]  I'm scared.
[27:01.920 --> 27:02.920]  How did I even pass?
[27:03.220 --> 27:04.060]  Andrew's in reverse.
[27:04.960 --> 27:06.360]  Andrew's in reverse.
[27:06.360 --> 27:06.600]  He's in reverse.
[27:12.120 --> 27:13.940]  How is he in reverse?
[27:15.260 --> 27:18.040]  He played the whole sequence.
[27:18.300 --> 27:19.180]  How's he still going?
[27:19.640 --> 27:21.300]  He played the whole sequence.
[27:21.580 --> 27:22.560]  Is he still alive?
[27:22.980 --> 27:25.340]  Come on.
[27:26.040 --> 27:27.140]  How did he play?
[27:27.320 --> 27:28.560]  How did he do that?
[27:36.360 --> 27:37.340]  Oh my god.
[27:40.620 --> 27:41.220]  Unreal.
[27:43.800 --> 27:50.760]  Yes! I had to finish first on that.
[27:50.940 --> 27:52.060]  Just some points.
[27:52.160 --> 27:53.460]  I just needed some points.
[27:55.540 --> 27:56.140]  Yes!
[27:56.940 --> 27:58.260]  Not last place.
[28:00.280 --> 28:01.600]  How did he...
[28:03.020 --> 28:04.460]  How did he do that?
[28:05.500 --> 28:07.260]  It made everything slower.
[28:07.400 --> 28:09.740]  Which actually was easier for me.
[28:11.300 --> 28:13.480]  Oh my god.
[28:15.680 --> 28:18.700]  It won't let me put it in either way.
[28:19.400 --> 28:20.320]  Let's just go back.
[28:21.300 --> 28:22.320]  For god's sake.
[28:23.200 --> 28:24.520]  Let's just go back here.
[28:24.640 --> 28:25.340]  Let's see what's going on.
[28:25.760 --> 28:28.040]  Did you say by the star?
[28:28.500 --> 28:29.880]  Just did a circle.
[28:30.300 --> 28:31.840]  Where's the beginning of this course?
[28:31.840 --> 28:33.300]  Where's the beginning?
[28:33.540 --> 28:35.200]  It's right there. Stop. Go back.
[28:35.960 --> 28:37.700]  Straight up. Up. Up. Up.
[28:38.880 --> 28:40.820]  I ran out of time.
[28:42.720 --> 28:43.900]  That's the end.
[28:44.080 --> 28:44.960]  What an idiot.
[28:45.740 --> 28:46.140]  Why?
[28:48.140 --> 28:49.840]  What a moron.
[28:50.800 --> 28:51.440]  Okay, Al.
[28:54.360 --> 28:55.680]  Damn it.
[28:56.020 --> 28:57.200]  Fuck off, Nick.
[28:59.080 --> 29:00.240]  Blew him away.
[29:02.140 --> 29:03.640]  It's grandpa's track.
[29:04.580 --> 29:05.520]  I'm nervous.
[29:05.740 --> 29:08.100]  Uh oh. We're as dead as dicks when he lands.
[29:08.180 --> 29:09.100]  Oh my god.
[29:09.560 --> 29:11.420]  Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Don't do it.
[29:11.780 --> 29:13.640]  Oh god.
[29:14.260 --> 29:15.380]  He's still got his guns.
[29:15.600 --> 29:16.680]  He's just shooting me.
[29:17.020 --> 29:18.580]  Grandpa's got a gun.
[29:20.340 --> 29:21.500]  Make it. Make it.
[29:22.100 --> 29:23.520]  Grandpa doesn't have a gun.
[29:26.080 --> 29:26.560]  No!
[29:27.720 --> 29:28.240]  No!
[29:28.380 --> 29:28.880]  No!
[29:29.920 --> 29:31.820]  Okay, I'm upside down and good.
[29:33.320 --> 29:33.900]  Go. Go. Go.
[29:34.080 --> 29:35.220]  There goes grandpa.
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.700]  He's still alive?
[29:38.360 --> 29:40.320]  Andrew is killing it on this course.
[29:40.960 --> 29:42.760]  As soon as I started going backwards,
[29:42.940 --> 29:44.840]  things made sense to me.
[29:45.000 --> 29:45.220]  No!
[29:51.720 --> 29:53.040]  What is this?
[29:53.040 --> 29:53.120]  What?
[29:55.400 --> 29:58.380]  Oh my god.
[29:59.280 --> 30:01.020]  No one finished.
[30:04.890 --> 30:07.300]  Alright, we gotta counterbalance.
[30:07.440 --> 30:08.480]  Counterbalance. Counterbalance.
[30:10.920 --> 30:11.740]  Oops.
[30:14.720 --> 30:15.700]  Oh man.
[30:17.480 --> 30:18.960]  Okay, my pumpkins are making it this time.
[30:19.340 --> 30:20.900]  Counterbalance. Counterbalance. Counterbalance.
[30:21.640 --> 30:22.120]  Oh!
[30:22.760 --> 30:24.660]  No, you've knocked me for six.
[30:27.180 --> 30:28.740]  Come on, I'm backwards.
[30:30.540 --> 30:32.060]  How did we die?
[30:32.720 --> 30:34.960]  Someone tried to take a shortcut and they missed
[30:34.960 --> 30:36.500]  and then it just pulled all of us.
[30:36.680 --> 30:38.700]  That's not even a shortcut, it's just a turn.
[30:42.840 --> 30:44.100]  I missed it!
[30:45.080 --> 30:45.500]  I made it.
[30:48.560 --> 30:49.160]  No!
[30:50.040 --> 30:52.660]  Where'd I go?
[30:52.980 --> 30:55.560]  Gavin, you got this!
[30:56.680 --> 30:57.280]  No you don't.
[30:57.880 --> 30:59.300]  You got the stones.
[31:02.220 --> 31:02.820]  Wow.
[31:03.380 --> 31:03.900]  Easy.
[31:05.440 --> 31:07.540]  Yelling at someone in the middle of a loop-de-loop
[31:07.540 --> 31:09.560]  that they don't have the stones is so funny.
[31:16.580 --> 31:17.100]  Halfway!
[31:17.500 --> 31:20.040]  Dead last.
[31:23.460 --> 31:23.980]  Yes!
[31:24.600 --> 31:25.520]  You beat me to it!
[31:25.580 --> 31:27.520]  Okay, I'm gonna find the beginning of this course now.
[31:27.620 --> 31:30.660]  You gotta go right and then down
[31:30.660 --> 31:32.100]  and then left and then back
[31:32.100 --> 31:33.320]  and then up and then right.
[31:33.840 --> 31:35.820]  Gavin, don't do it.
[31:36.960 --> 31:38.140]  I see what you're thinking.
[31:38.680 --> 31:39.660]  Stop thinking.
[31:40.120 --> 31:40.660]  What did I do?
[31:41.080 --> 31:43.780]  You know what? I'm gonna start thinking.
[31:47.200 --> 31:47.640]  No!
[31:48.640 --> 31:49.080]  Shit.
[31:52.020 --> 31:52.460]  Dominion.
[31:52.500 --> 31:54.260]  So this game is five players, eh?
[31:54.340 --> 31:55.380]  It's actually six.
[31:56.460 --> 31:57.640]  God damn it.
[31:58.000 --> 31:59.580]  Yeah, Gavin wouldn't tell us that though.
[32:00.880 --> 32:02.280]  It's a six player game
[32:02.280 --> 32:04.420]  and you can get it on Steam.
[32:05.020 --> 32:06.560]  And I recommend the hell out of it.
[32:07.200 --> 32:09.380]  Oh, stay!
[32:09.980 --> 32:12.540]  It doesn't come with free friends though.
[32:12.620 --> 32:13.200]  You gotta find those.
[32:13.200 --> 32:14.940]  No, you have to get your own friends.
[32:15.340 --> 32:16.500]  Shit. Gavin!
[32:16.800 --> 32:17.200]  Gavin!
[32:19.740 --> 32:21.380]  You just murdered an old man in his pockets.
[32:21.520 --> 32:23.440]  That was like malicious.
[32:24.340 --> 32:24.620]  Yeah.
[32:25.380 --> 32:27.040]  I was just trying to be careful.
[32:27.240 --> 32:27.880]  Don't! Stop!
[32:29.020 --> 32:31.400]  I was just gonna slowly turn around.
[32:31.660 --> 32:32.400]  Don't shoot me.
[32:36.840 --> 32:39.400]  How did I explode out the gate?
[32:39.440 --> 32:40.340]  I just don't exist.
[32:41.920 --> 32:42.440]  Shortcut!
[32:43.180 --> 32:43.720]  What?
[32:44.560 --> 32:46.180]  He killed you both for it.
[32:46.380 --> 32:47.620]  Why? That was real.
[32:47.940 --> 32:49.040]  Maybe it's too far.
[32:49.340 --> 32:50.780]  Come on!
[32:51.680 --> 32:52.400]  Here we go.
[32:53.120 --> 32:54.560]  Maybe it's too far.
[32:57.800 --> 32:58.760]  Put me down!
[32:59.660 --> 33:01.300]  How did he make it?
[33:01.480 --> 33:02.760]  Because I'm super good at stuff.
[33:04.960 --> 33:06.480]  I don't think that's true.
[33:06.660 --> 33:08.680]  Oh my god, I got blasted.
[33:09.040 --> 33:09.980]  Holy shit.
[33:09.980 --> 33:11.380]  Let go of me!
[33:13.520 --> 33:13.940]  I don't think
[33:13.940 --> 33:15.600]  I got any points that whole run.
[33:15.700 --> 33:17.880]  I only finished once.
[33:18.060 --> 33:19.100]  Let go of me!
[33:20.580 --> 33:21.580]  God damn.
[33:21.740 --> 33:23.780]  I am having a bad run today.
[33:24.240 --> 33:25.680]  I can't catch up with
[33:25.680 --> 33:26.520]  Theme Chanick.
[33:28.580 --> 33:29.780]  Theme Chanick.
[33:31.860 --> 33:33.840]  We can't keep going along
[33:33.840 --> 33:35.780]  the existing track. We're just gonna shortcut
[33:35.780 --> 33:36.520]  the whole thing.
[33:36.520 --> 33:38.080]  Did you find the beginning, Andrew?
[33:38.280 --> 33:40.000]  I found it. I got there.
[33:41.120 --> 33:41.400]  Oh yeah?
[33:42.300 --> 33:43.520]  Third time's a charm, huh?
[33:45.700 --> 33:46.620]  Oh, this is bad.
[33:48.420 --> 33:49.980]  There are no slots.
[33:50.300 --> 33:50.640]  Oh, there's one.
[33:53.040 --> 33:54.240]  Oh my god.
[33:54.300 --> 33:55.160]  That's so bad.
[33:58.160 --> 33:58.940]  Godspeed, gents!
[34:00.420 --> 34:02.600]  No! I got hit by a car!
[34:03.260 --> 34:03.940]  What's all this?
[34:07.690 --> 34:08.980]  You idiot.
[34:10.160 --> 34:11.620]  Hold your fire!
[34:11.800 --> 34:14.940]  Hold your fire!
[34:15.420 --> 34:17.580]  Jumbo Crazy Eyes 10 gifted.
[34:17.980 --> 34:19.720]  This lap is dedicated to you,
[34:19.740 --> 34:20.560]  Jumbo Crazy Eyes.
[34:20.800 --> 34:22.860]  What a dodge!
[34:25.960 --> 34:26.200]  No!
[34:28.600 --> 34:29.460]  No!
[34:29.460 --> 34:30.540]  No!
[34:36.080 --> 34:37.200]  Hit that!
[34:43.620 --> 34:45.900]  You are slapping me silly.
[34:46.180 --> 34:47.460]  God, I am just...
[34:47.460 --> 34:49.440]  I am playing so bad on this one, man.
[34:49.500 --> 34:50.340]  This is brutal.
[34:50.340 --> 34:50.860]  Shortcut!
[34:53.940 --> 34:57.640]  Where am I?
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.340]  God damn it!
[35:00.920 --> 35:01.520]  Oh, nice.
[35:01.600 --> 35:02.540]  What a shortcut!
[35:03.700 --> 35:04.400]  Oh, that was good.
[35:05.280 --> 35:07.480]  Are you fooling what?
[35:07.600 --> 35:10.040]  Are you fooling down the track?
[35:10.400 --> 35:10.680]  No.
[35:11.580 --> 35:13.040]  You all saw it.
[35:13.560 --> 35:14.120]  No!
[35:15.380 --> 35:18.080]  God, dude, I have not played any of this round.
[35:18.080 --> 35:20.920]  I go off the edge immediately every time.
[35:21.200 --> 35:22.400]  Where was I there?
[35:22.640 --> 35:23.480]  Where was I?
[35:23.740 --> 35:26.400]  Stop bumping the alien.
[35:27.500 --> 35:28.360]  Come on!
[35:28.720 --> 35:29.080]  Come on!
[35:29.200 --> 35:30.740]  Oh, Geoff!
[35:31.760 --> 35:32.480]  Wait, what happened there?
[35:32.560 --> 35:33.880]  Decided to turn it on.
[35:36.720 --> 35:38.940]  I can't believe it didn't count my jump.
[35:39.180 --> 35:40.160]  I am at 750
[35:40.160 --> 35:41.240]  and I am trapped here.
[35:41.440 --> 35:42.460]  This is where I die.
[35:43.720 --> 35:44.800]  Geoff climbing.
[35:45.260 --> 35:46.840]  I don't want to be in last place.
[35:47.460 --> 35:48.940]  I am in last place!
[35:49.200 --> 35:50.900]  I know, and I don't want to be like you.
[35:51.120 --> 35:51.520]  No offense.
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.280]  Thanks, man. Plenty taken.
[35:55.960 --> 35:56.800]  He didn't say that.
[35:57.140 --> 35:58.320]  Oh, he did say that. Never mind.
[35:59.000 --> 35:59.800]  Jesus Christ.
[36:00.140 --> 36:01.380]  Hey, Eric, I am sorry about Nick.
[36:01.800 --> 36:02.820]  God, no kidding.
[36:05.140 --> 36:05.940]  Fixing things.
[36:06.420 --> 36:07.320]  What did you do?
[36:07.920 --> 36:09.000]  You broke something.
[36:10.220 --> 36:12.680]  Let's see if I can make it past the first second of this.
[36:12.680 --> 36:14.140]  No, the bus!
[36:14.420 --> 36:15.540]  Not much further, though.
[36:18.680 --> 36:19.980]  Watch out for the giant sack.
[36:20.100 --> 36:22.560]  I have no idea what it's like to make this leg of the race.
[36:23.500 --> 36:24.520]  It's a lot of fun.
[36:25.600 --> 36:26.080]  Exhilarating.
[36:26.240 --> 36:27.520]  Come on, alien!
[36:28.640 --> 36:29.480]  No, alien!
[36:29.840 --> 36:30.720]  Come on, alien!
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.520]  That was rough.
[36:35.820 --> 36:37.520]  That was brutal.
[36:38.660 --> 36:39.440]  Stay in it.
[36:39.440 --> 36:39.980]  No!
[36:40.580 --> 36:44.100]  That was a good mine by you, Gavin.
[36:44.500 --> 36:46.400]  That was a bad mine by you, Gavin.
[36:47.180 --> 36:48.100]  Sweet move.
[36:48.800 --> 36:49.700]  Oh, no!
[36:50.120 --> 36:52.000]  Oh, my God.
[36:54.220 --> 36:55.080]  I'll touch you.
[36:55.320 --> 36:56.060]  I'll touch you.
[36:56.300 --> 36:57.600]  I'll touch you.
[37:00.080 --> 37:01.660]  No, you son of a bitch!
[37:02.160 --> 37:03.600]  Why did I go off the edge?
[37:04.080 --> 37:04.680]  Oh, my God.
[37:04.920 --> 37:05.780]  The game froze for a second.
[37:05.780 --> 37:07.940]  I'm not... I'm doing it.
[37:07.960 --> 37:08.500]  I'm doing it.
[37:09.600 --> 37:10.040]  No!
[37:11.980 --> 37:13.660]  Why does it keep...
[37:14.680 --> 37:16.140]  It's Grandpa's road!
[37:17.540 --> 37:17.980]  Shortcuts.
[37:18.060 --> 37:19.920]  If I found out shortcuts are partially on,
[37:19.940 --> 37:20.700]  I'm going to be livid.
[37:22.300 --> 37:23.180]  Partially on?
[37:23.320 --> 37:25.260]  I don't know what you've been diddling in the settings.
[37:26.260 --> 37:27.140]  Partially on?
[37:28.760 --> 37:30.220]  What have you been diddling
[37:30.220 --> 37:31.320]  in the settings, man?
[37:31.540 --> 37:32.440]  This is horrible.
[37:34.040 --> 37:36.740]  Well, if it isn't...
[37:36.740 --> 37:38.520]  The Tesla coil
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.540]  killing everyone.
[37:40.900 --> 37:41.620]  Push him.
[37:41.920 --> 37:42.780]  Oh, my God.
[37:42.860 --> 37:43.080]  I can't.
[37:43.500 --> 37:50.020]  Oh, my God.
[37:51.220 --> 37:52.480]  Grandpa's heading home
[37:52.480 --> 37:53.540]  on the road.
[37:53.900 --> 37:54.940]  Little Grandpa driving.
[37:55.900 --> 37:57.080]  That was rough for Geoff.
[37:59.660 --> 38:00.680]  Oh, my God.
[38:00.680 --> 38:02.640]  I'm stuck at 750. I'm trapped.
[38:02.940 --> 38:04.980]  The alien is not doing well for me.
[38:05.180 --> 38:06.620]  I don't like the alien.
[38:06.780 --> 38:08.360]  I cannot see him. He is dead.
[38:08.660 --> 38:10.040]  You can't see him?
[38:10.280 --> 38:12.580]  No. Immediately, he's there and he's gone.
[38:14.060 --> 38:14.680]  It's bad.
[38:14.680 --> 38:15.880]  Maybe that's user Eric.
[38:17.060 --> 38:17.880]  Or user Eric.
[38:18.880 --> 38:20.340]  I am user Eric.
[38:20.540 --> 38:21.720]  That's what his name is.
[38:22.100 --> 38:22.460]  Thank you.
[38:24.500 --> 38:26.020]  That's the nice thing about Andrew.
[38:26.140 --> 38:27.760]  He's so sharp, he gets it.
[38:29.020 --> 38:29.980]  Almost every time,
[38:30.120 --> 38:32.320]  he'll know exactly when you lay down a punchline.
[38:33.000 --> 38:33.640]  Andrew, move!
[38:34.480 --> 38:36.260]  God damn it, right off the edge again.
[38:36.540 --> 38:38.300]  Dude, I went off and then ended up on.
[38:40.940 --> 38:42.620]  Oh, that's a personal victory for me.
[38:42.840 --> 38:43.500]  Never made it that far.
[38:46.320 --> 38:47.760]  I got malleted.
[38:48.600 --> 38:49.840]  Okay, how am I going to do this?
[38:49.960 --> 38:50.800]  Croquet central.
[38:52.720 --> 38:54.360]  What? It said I was going to be on the left,
[38:54.500 --> 38:55.160]  surely, there, didn't it?
[38:55.160 --> 38:57.280]  Why would it give me a boost?
[39:03.940 --> 39:05.580]  I am a survivor.
[39:06.980 --> 39:08.640]  Why was it like a pinball?
[39:09.540 --> 39:09.960]  Bastards.
[39:15.200 --> 39:16.620]  Oh, Geoff, go. Leave him in the dust.
[39:16.700 --> 39:18.540]  How does this man never spill his pumpkins?
[39:21.120 --> 39:22.660]  How did that happen?
[39:25.340 --> 39:26.680]  Ah, I don't want it.
[39:29.360 --> 39:29.720]  Unbelievable.
[39:31.080 --> 39:33.020]  Alright, new rule. Andrew can't take that jump.
[39:33.580 --> 39:35.080]  I just died from it.
[39:35.660 --> 39:36.640]  Okay, well, don't do it again.
[39:36.920 --> 39:37.500]  Andrew, take the jump.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.460]  God damn it, I got shoved.
[39:41.380 --> 39:42.040]  There you go.
[39:43.440 --> 39:45.460]  Oh, that's weird. Andrew can't take the jump,
[39:45.560 --> 39:46.600]  but Nick can take the jump.
[39:46.820 --> 39:48.200]  That's how it worked for Nick before.
[39:50.160 --> 39:51.560]  The alien is bad.
[39:53.700 --> 39:54.860]  God damn it, Geoff.
[39:58.540 --> 39:59.660]  Leave him in the dust.
[40:00.060 --> 40:00.880]  You washed me.
[40:01.380 --> 40:03.600]  That's what you get for trying to kill me.
[40:04.300 --> 40:05.180]  No, the alien.
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.860]  I feel like they've buffed the gun.
[40:07.900 --> 40:08.620]  I think the gun
[40:09.100 --> 40:09.860]  makes you
[40:11.080 --> 40:12.160]  screw up more now.
[40:12.580 --> 40:14.820]  I was so close to getting some points.
[40:16.020 --> 40:17.160]  I don't know where we're going.
[40:17.160 --> 40:19.440]  I don't like
[40:19.440 --> 40:20.040]  where we're going.
[40:21.580 --> 40:23.140]  Slow and
[40:23.140 --> 40:23.840]  steady.
[40:25.140 --> 40:26.940]  Grandpa's got to get back into this.
[40:27.200 --> 40:27.500]  Nope.
[40:28.760 --> 40:29.060]  Damn it.
[40:29.800 --> 40:30.600]  Alien!
[40:35.920 --> 40:37.380]  Go, go, go!
[40:37.780 --> 40:38.240]  Points!
[40:38.640 --> 40:39.760]  I got points!
[40:40.200 --> 40:40.620]  Yeah!
[40:42.240 --> 40:43.640]  Oh my god.
[40:43.640 --> 40:46.540]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[40:46.640 --> 40:48.040]  Oh my god!
[40:49.820 --> 40:51.260]  Thank god.
[40:51.400 --> 40:53.580]  I think I only got the last checkpoint.
[40:55.400 --> 40:57.560]  Check it out. 750. Watch.
[40:57.940 --> 40:59.640]  Here it comes. 750.
[41:00.480 --> 41:01.460]  Yeah! 900!
[41:02.200 --> 41:03.120]  We need to stop Nick.
[41:03.780 --> 41:05.600]  The theme has run away with it.
[41:05.660 --> 41:06.440]  God damn.
[41:07.320 --> 41:08.040]  Oh!
[41:08.720 --> 41:10.460]  You've got to be kidding me.
[41:10.460 --> 41:10.980]  Hello!
[41:12.380 --> 41:13.740]  It ain't over yet.
[41:16.320 --> 41:17.300]  Need more track.
[41:18.080 --> 41:19.080]  Need more points.
[41:19.960 --> 41:21.820]  Oh, this is going to be...
[41:22.280 --> 41:23.980]  Jocka said the greatest game I've ever seen.
[41:24.100 --> 41:25.740]  I'm going to purchase five copies for my friends
[41:25.740 --> 41:26.960]  whilst it's five.
[41:27.660 --> 41:30.520]  Okay, cool. That's great. I love it.
[41:31.160 --> 41:32.360]  Excellent. Happy to hear it.
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.100]  It's a six player game. This game rocks.
[41:34.800 --> 41:36.400]  Oh, look at what Gavin's doing.
[41:36.880 --> 41:37.820]  Don't look ever.
[41:40.340 --> 41:42.340]  Don't look ever.
[41:44.200 --> 41:45.380]  Don't look ever.
[41:45.480 --> 41:45.820]  Don't look ever.
[41:45.820 --> 41:46.200]  Let's run.
[41:48.500 --> 41:49.280]  Oh my god.
[41:49.360 --> 41:50.720]  The best dive I've ever had on this...
[41:50.720 --> 41:51.180]  Damn it.
[41:51.740 --> 41:53.420]  I got hit by a car.
[42:00.240 --> 42:01.760]  Gavin, you crashed into me
[42:01.760 --> 42:02.980]  when I had the Tesla coil.
[42:03.680 --> 42:04.300]  Is that what happened?
[42:04.300 --> 42:05.420]  Come on, Geoff.
[42:06.540 --> 42:07.440]  You got it.
[42:09.020 --> 42:10.540]  You did it, Geoff.
[42:10.860 --> 42:11.880]  You did it, Geoff.
[42:12.180 --> 42:13.940]  Andrew just rided me.
[42:14.620 --> 42:15.820]  I'm not an oos.
[42:17.500 --> 42:18.240]  Oh, no.
[42:21.480 --> 42:23.020]  Oh, is it 50% off
[42:23.020 --> 42:23.700]  in Steam right now?
[42:23.920 --> 42:24.320]  Oh, wow.
[42:25.880 --> 42:27.840]  This game is a must-buy.
[42:27.940 --> 42:29.220]  50% off. This game is nuts.
[42:29.820 --> 42:31.740]  Absolutely. That's a steal.
[42:32.520 --> 42:33.940]  But it's not. It's just a bargain.
[42:34.100 --> 42:35.220]  You're not actually stealing it.
[42:35.680 --> 42:37.860]  You can act like you stole it.
[42:37.980 --> 42:39.280]  That's fine. I'm not going to stop you.
[42:39.960 --> 42:41.320]  Put it in your digital...
[42:41.320 --> 42:41.700]  Boom!
[42:42.980 --> 42:44.960]  How does it work sometimes?
[42:45.660 --> 42:46.100]  Aliens!
[42:47.240 --> 42:49.720]  I really need points and I'm just not getting them.
[42:50.020 --> 42:50.440]  Go to hell!
[42:51.540 --> 42:52.320]  What was that?
[42:52.580 --> 42:54.160]  I blasted you, bitch.
[42:55.060 --> 42:56.840]  No, you blasted me, bitch!
[42:56.840 --> 42:57.400]  Ah!
[43:00.020 --> 43:01.060]  Don't get big!
[43:01.920 --> 43:02.900]  Don't get big!
[43:03.760 --> 43:05.100]  Geoff, what the Christ
[43:05.100 --> 43:05.880]  was that about?
[43:06.820 --> 43:07.420]  Ah!
[43:09.040 --> 43:10.300]  That was just points.
[43:11.580 --> 43:13.360]  Just a rugby tackle
[43:13.360 --> 43:14.000]  with wheels.
[43:14.920 --> 43:16.340]  Oh, no!
[43:17.200 --> 43:17.960]  I'm big!
[43:19.660 --> 43:20.680]  I'm a monster!
[43:21.320 --> 43:23.400]  Is that the front or the back? Is that forwards or what?
[43:23.580 --> 43:24.420]  He's not going to make it.
[43:24.420 --> 43:25.680]  He's not going to make it.
[43:27.300 --> 43:28.000]  No!
[43:33.060 --> 43:34.420]  Fall off, you idiot!
[43:34.740 --> 43:35.640]  Fall, you idiot!
[43:38.920 --> 43:40.320]  Not me!
[43:40.880 --> 43:41.280]  No!
[43:42.160 --> 43:43.520]  Not like that.
[43:44.620 --> 43:46.400]  No! God damn it.
[43:48.000 --> 43:48.360]  No!
[43:49.020 --> 43:50.400]  Oh my God, where?
[43:52.380 --> 43:53.540]  Jesus Christ!
[43:53.540 --> 43:55.300]  How is Gavin still in this?
[43:55.380 --> 43:57.420]  I can't believe I lived!
[43:57.900 --> 43:58.840]  Keep living!
[43:58.880 --> 44:00.060]  I don't think I have points!
[44:00.440 --> 44:01.080]  Keep living!
[44:03.320 --> 44:04.520]  Go alien!
[44:05.940 --> 44:06.540]  Alien!
[44:07.360 --> 44:08.820]  Oh, I failed so massively.
[44:09.780 --> 44:11.300]  That's right, baby rats.
[44:11.500 --> 44:13.000]  Up over a thousand, finally.
[44:16.420 --> 44:17.020]  Terrible.
[44:17.880 --> 44:19.580]  Gotta change off the alien, baby.
[44:20.480 --> 44:21.560]  Oh, God.
[44:22.280 --> 44:23.300]  Look at that.
[44:23.440 --> 44:25.060]  Ended with 1475.
[44:25.360 --> 44:25.580]  Beautiful.
[44:26.320 --> 44:28.980]  Congratulations, Mr. Theme, you did it.
[44:29.440 --> 44:30.380]  Thank you.
[44:30.520 --> 44:30.940]  Damn.
[44:31.500 --> 44:34.800]  Let me turn shortcuts back on to fully on instead of partially on.
[44:40.080 --> 44:41.200]  Oh, man.
[44:41.820 --> 44:43.060]  Who's missing? I'm missing.
[44:43.180 --> 44:44.500]  God, this game fucking rocks.
[44:45.960 --> 44:46.840]  It really is a great game.
[44:46.840 --> 44:48.580]  It's so fucking fun.
[44:48.800 --> 44:50.920]  Oh, I got a new vehicle.
[44:51.200 --> 44:52.640]  You guys are fucked. This rocks.
[44:55.930 --> 44:56.130]  Bye.
[44:56.690 --> 44:57.090]  Oh.
[44:58.310 --> 45:00.630]  I reached level 50, I think I unlocked everything.
[45:01.090 --> 45:01.870]  Oh, there I am.
[45:02.690 --> 45:04.470]  Dang, button, you're level 50?
[45:04.910 --> 45:05.510]  Yeah, dude.
[45:05.850 --> 45:07.830]  I'm only 30 or something, 29.
[45:08.270 --> 45:09.630]  Did you just turn shortcuts on?
[45:10.930 --> 45:13.210]  No, I haven't touched shortcuts.
[45:13.470 --> 45:15.690]  I'm in the thing so I can change the fucking level.
[45:16.070 --> 45:17.270]  It just said shortcuts off.
[45:17.770 --> 45:18.770]  Shortcuts are on.
[45:19.510 --> 45:20.990]  I have not touched it.
[45:21.050 --> 45:22.410]  It has been on the whole time.
[45:22.630 --> 45:23.750]  Didn't it just say they were off?
[45:24.250 --> 45:25.310]  It said sometimes.
[45:27.430 --> 45:28.590]  Here's off, here's on.
[45:28.690 --> 45:29.510]  Here's off, here's on.
[45:30.710 --> 45:31.810]  They've been on.
[45:32.230 --> 45:33.190]  Chat says it was off.
[45:34.970 --> 45:37.730]  They were on. We saw a shortcut happen.
[45:38.990 --> 45:39.430]  Rarely.
[45:39.450 --> 45:40.970]  I don't know what to tell you.
[45:41.110 --> 45:42.370]  Rarely. Shortcuts occurred.
[45:43.410 --> 45:43.850]  Rarely.
[45:44.690 --> 45:46.210]  There's no sometime setting.
[45:46.470 --> 45:47.570]  It's on or off.
[45:47.630 --> 45:50.150]  I agree with Sunny Sleezer. Check the tapes.
[45:50.250 --> 45:52.450]  I don't give a fuck what Sunny Sleezer says.
[45:52.610 --> 45:53.790]  They were on the whole time.
[45:54.010 --> 45:56.090]  Special shout out to Sunny Sleezer.
[45:56.230 --> 45:56.510]  Congratulations.
[45:58.370 --> 45:58.890]  Gargantuan.
[46:00.330 --> 46:01.950]  I like the grumple.
[46:02.090 --> 46:02.410]  Boom.
[46:03.170 --> 46:04.690]  Let's fucking do this, baby.
[46:05.230 --> 46:06.070]  Let's do some crumping.
[46:09.970 --> 46:12.490]  Well, this game should probably take us to 501.
[46:12.490 --> 46:14.310]  I think it's going to take us well beyond that.
[46:15.470 --> 46:16.510]  Maybe 505.
[46:17.230 --> 46:17.510]  Yeah.
[46:18.590 --> 46:19.630]  Maybe 520.
[46:20.650 --> 46:22.570]  I doubt that. That's a long one.
[46:23.250 --> 46:25.390]  We got shit out of the gate on this.
[46:25.450 --> 46:25.870]  Look at this.
[46:26.730 --> 46:28.290]  It's awful. I love it.
[46:29.510 --> 46:30.570]  Who did it?
[46:30.850 --> 46:31.330]  Who took the shit?
[46:32.830 --> 46:33.870]  Oh no!
[46:35.250 --> 46:35.770]  Gargantuan!
[46:35.770 --> 46:36.790]  Fuck you, asshole.
[46:40.430 --> 46:43.770]  No, the grump!
[46:44.910 --> 46:45.870]  No, the grump!
[46:46.170 --> 46:48.390]  You posted me through that little hole.
[46:52.610 --> 46:53.990]  Yeah, there we go.
[46:55.030 --> 46:59.870]  Alright, could have gone better.
[47:00.450 --> 47:01.490]  Could have gone better.
[47:01.870 --> 47:02.650]  I agree.
[47:04.470 --> 47:05.450]  I'll do that one.
[47:06.630 --> 47:07.750]  I'll take a fan.
[47:07.750 --> 47:08.670]  This is for all of us.
[47:08.770 --> 47:09.350]  The track.
[47:11.170 --> 47:11.690]  Ooh.
[47:12.750 --> 47:13.870]  It looks like fun, right?
[47:14.910 --> 47:18.550]  I think we need a fan before that hole, and a fan after that hole.
[47:21.490 --> 47:24.730]  Here we go.
[47:25.450 --> 47:25.970]  Zoom.
[47:28.110 --> 47:29.050]  I... wow.
[47:29.430 --> 47:30.090]  Bang, bang.
[47:30.110 --> 47:31.730]  I got completely lost.
[47:31.730 --> 47:33.050]  Oh, it saved all of us.
[47:33.110 --> 47:33.570]  Great.
[47:35.310 --> 47:36.290]  That's a reset.
[47:37.230 --> 47:38.390]  Do it again, boys.
[47:43.280 --> 47:44.560]  Oh, mid-ass slam.
[47:44.840 --> 47:45.040]  Ouch.
[47:46.300 --> 47:47.620]  Stop touching me!
[47:47.840 --> 47:48.860]  Daddy's big now.
[47:51.780 --> 47:52.900]  Get out of the way!
[47:53.320 --> 47:54.300]  What a smash!
[47:54.980 --> 47:56.000]  Yes, I made it!
[48:00.000 --> 48:01.580]  How did that happen?
[48:01.580 --> 48:02.760]  I can't believe you're alive.
[48:03.240 --> 48:05.460]  How did you make that?
[48:05.860 --> 48:06.220]  That was crazy.
[48:06.500 --> 48:07.680]  I can't believe it.
[48:07.860 --> 48:09.020]  What is this?
[48:09.680 --> 48:10.460]  It's a road.
[48:10.900 --> 48:14.120]  Stop touching me!
[48:17.080 --> 48:18.400]  Crumple coming through.
[48:18.700 --> 48:20.060]  Get out of the way.
[48:20.460 --> 48:21.700]  I made the whole thing.
[48:22.340 --> 48:23.040]  Crazy.
[48:24.580 --> 48:25.280]  Damn.
[48:26.140 --> 48:27.680]  Everyone's up there now.
[48:27.680 --> 48:28.760]  Nick in last.
[48:33.660 --> 48:35.960]  Shortcuts are coming if you put that face in the right way.
[48:36.280 --> 48:36.900]  Face it up, right?
[48:37.500 --> 48:38.400]  Face it up.
[48:40.760 --> 48:41.480]  Shortcut time!
[48:43.660 --> 48:45.860]  Shortcuts are on partially. Let's see what happens.
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.220]  Somebody said, wait, this is a five-player game?
[48:49.320 --> 48:50.260]  It's a six-player game now, baby.
[48:50.920 --> 48:51.480]  That's right, baby.
[48:51.480 --> 48:51.580]  That's right, Nick.
[48:56.850 --> 48:58.110]  It's nice to be at the front.
[48:58.830 --> 48:59.650]  It's so nice.
[49:00.510 --> 49:01.030]  No!
[49:01.610 --> 49:02.450]  I hated it.
[49:04.490 --> 49:05.170]  Who's this?
[49:06.330 --> 49:07.490]  It's Team Chanick.
[49:10.950 --> 49:13.150]  How did you ride the wall that long?
[49:13.690 --> 49:14.150]  Don't know.
[49:15.530 --> 49:16.010]  I wish I had.
[49:16.430 --> 49:18.090]  I would have respawned.
[49:18.330 --> 49:18.870]  I'm good!
[49:24.210 --> 49:24.890]  No!
[49:25.370 --> 49:26.650]  I don't remember.
[49:27.310 --> 49:27.490]  Stop!
[49:28.590 --> 49:30.430]  I got hit and turned around.
[49:30.570 --> 49:32.010]  What happened?
[49:32.130 --> 49:32.810]  I'm alive.
[49:36.550 --> 49:37.770]  Goodbye, friends!
[49:38.830 --> 49:40.210]  I didn't even land.
[49:40.490 --> 49:42.650]  What happened, boys?
[49:44.190 --> 49:45.190]  That's what happens
[49:45.190 --> 49:46.370]  when you turn them all the way on.
[49:48.010 --> 49:49.370]  Who needs
[49:49.370 --> 49:50.290]  partial shortcuts?
[49:53.530 --> 49:54.570]  Get off!
[49:54.770 --> 49:56.510]  No, I missed it!
[49:59.210 --> 50:00.950]  It was the end.
[50:01.070 --> 50:02.010]  What a waste.
[50:03.410 --> 50:04.370]  God damn it.
[50:05.450 --> 50:06.570]  That was a good run.
[50:10.830 --> 50:12.390]  Rats in dead last.
[50:17.170 --> 50:18.830]  Don't know what that was.
[50:19.310 --> 50:20.230]  Did you see the bulls?
[50:20.230 --> 50:20.850]  Yeah.
[50:21.330 --> 50:22.890]  It's a bulldozer.
[50:28.960 --> 50:29.800]  That's gonna suck.
[50:31.100 --> 50:32.420]  What is this?
[50:32.820 --> 50:33.380]  Oh, that.
[50:34.640 --> 50:35.820]  Uh-oh.
[50:37.740 --> 50:38.220]  Now.
[50:42.460 --> 50:43.460]  Here we go!
[50:45.020 --> 50:46.340]  Gizmo's coming through!
[50:46.620 --> 50:47.800]  God damn it!
[50:48.120 --> 50:49.200]  Oh, the specimen.
[50:49.540 --> 50:51.460]  The specimen.
[50:51.760 --> 50:53.080]  Oh no, the substance is everywhere.
[50:56.580 --> 50:57.940]  God damn it.
[50:59.340 --> 51:00.140]  I'm big!
[51:00.440 --> 51:02.120]  If you touch me, you'll die!
[51:04.060 --> 51:05.340]  I've got the big goo.
[51:06.480 --> 51:06.780]  No!
[51:07.540 --> 51:08.840]  Yes, I made it!
[51:10.720 --> 51:12.460]  What did you do to me there?
[51:13.240 --> 51:13.960]  God damn it.
[51:15.060 --> 51:15.620]  No!
[51:17.420 --> 51:18.260]  No again!
[51:18.560 --> 51:19.440]  Where am I?
[51:23.080 --> 51:24.120]  That was so close.
[51:24.600 --> 51:26.840]  Oh, good try. I'm so glad you missed that.
[51:29.560 --> 51:30.980]  Well, this is unfortunate.
[51:31.620 --> 51:32.460]  Go around that.
[51:34.340 --> 51:35.860]  No, no, wait, wait, wait!
[51:36.360 --> 51:36.820]  You idiots!
[51:37.380 --> 51:38.380]  Yes! No!
[51:39.160 --> 51:39.720]  Partial!
[51:42.880 --> 51:43.500]  Here we go!
[51:44.680 --> 51:45.240]  No!
[51:47.400 --> 51:48.520]  You asshole!
[51:48.520 --> 51:49.080]  No!
[51:50.820 --> 51:52.420]  That's what happens when you turn them
[51:52.420 --> 51:54.580]  from partial to all the way on, baby.
[51:54.860 --> 51:54.980]  Fuck!
[51:55.960 --> 51:56.320]  No!
[51:57.420 --> 51:59.180]  Off the side immediately.
[51:59.820 --> 52:01.280]  Brutal. Absolutely.
[52:01.340 --> 52:03.360]  I think my missile hit everyone in the map.
[52:05.580 --> 52:09.760]  No, don't touch me!
[52:09.940 --> 52:12.680]  I went big as I went!
[52:13.100 --> 52:13.700]  Land mine!
[52:14.920 --> 52:15.600]  The substance!
[52:21.160 --> 52:22.160]  Stop!
[52:23.560 --> 52:24.980]  Where am I?
[52:25.300 --> 52:28.240]  You fucking idiot.
[52:30.820 --> 52:31.720]  That's scary.
[52:34.080 --> 52:35.420]  Alright, boys.
[52:37.560 --> 52:40.020]  You killed me by doing that!
[52:40.320 --> 52:40.400]  Yes!
[52:41.720 --> 52:41.920]  Yes!
[52:43.380 --> 52:43.580]  Woo!
[52:45.040 --> 52:45.540]  No!
[52:47.520 --> 52:49.000]  Keep climbing!
[52:51.140 --> 52:52.660]  That's what I'm talking about.
[52:52.840 --> 52:55.240]  Heavy goo with all these points.
[52:55.500 --> 52:56.840]  Andrew in last place.
[52:56.980 --> 52:57.840]  Bringing up the rear.
[52:58.160 --> 52:58.900]  Poor little Gizmo.
[53:00.940 --> 53:02.560]  Poor little Gizmo.
[53:02.900 --> 53:05.260]  I need the pumpkins back is what I need.
[53:05.680 --> 53:06.100]  There we go.
[53:07.240 --> 53:08.460]  Yeah, baby!
[53:09.360 --> 53:10.240]  Shortcut alley.
[53:11.720 --> 53:12.860]  Do it the other way.
[53:13.460 --> 53:14.280]  There you go.
[53:14.760 --> 53:16.300]  Yeah, Gavin!
[53:17.120 --> 53:18.720]  Oh, Gavin.
[53:21.140 --> 53:21.980]  Gross Gavin.
[53:22.640 --> 53:23.160]  Boom!
[53:24.480 --> 53:24.740]  Oh, no.
[53:26.380 --> 53:26.980]  Live!
[53:28.760 --> 53:29.960]  Two bullets.
[53:32.100 --> 53:33.140]  Excuse me!
[53:33.880 --> 53:34.160]  It's okay!
[53:34.740 --> 53:35.440]  Slow down!
[53:39.940 --> 53:41.620]  Live and let live, Andrew.
[53:42.160 --> 53:43.500]  I'm not trying to fight you.
[53:45.680 --> 53:48.280]  Is it almost time for the best time of the week?
[53:48.480 --> 53:48.760]  Almost.
[53:48.760 --> 53:51.720]  God damn it.
[53:54.580 --> 53:55.780]  No way!
[53:55.860 --> 53:56.600]  I lived!
[53:57.320 --> 53:58.640]  Nick the bastard man!
[54:00.680 --> 54:01.100]  Shortcut!
[54:02.720 --> 54:03.440]  Damn it!
[54:04.540 --> 54:07.860]  He hit it!
[54:07.940 --> 54:10.320]  I think I got the shortcut.
[54:11.160 --> 54:12.460]  You son of a bitch.
[54:12.900 --> 54:14.000]  I think I went through backwards.
[54:14.200 --> 54:14.820]  It didn't count.
[54:14.820 --> 54:15.920]  Hang on.
[54:16.260 --> 54:17.120]  Lighting it up!
[54:17.820 --> 54:20.120]  Oh my god.
[54:20.420 --> 54:22.860]  The shotgun, Nick!
[54:23.820 --> 54:25.380]  That's what they call me.
[54:25.400 --> 54:26.360]  Shotgun Nick.
[54:26.720 --> 54:27.360]  Take the shortcut.
[54:28.580 --> 54:30.060]  They're partially on.
[54:30.380 --> 54:30.700]  Yeah!
[54:35.360 --> 54:37.780]  Well, that didn't work.
[54:38.280 --> 54:39.100]  I respect it.
[54:39.740 --> 54:42.460]  Wow, we got bunched up. That was bad.
[54:42.460 --> 54:44.320]  Oh, they just appeared.
[54:45.460 --> 54:45.960]  What?
[54:46.400 --> 54:47.020]  The spess.
[54:47.640 --> 54:48.460]  Yeah, make the jump.
[54:48.920 --> 54:50.480]  Yeah, the spess appeared.
[54:52.760 --> 54:53.260]  Okay.
[54:53.760 --> 54:55.720]  See, it just kills you if you're in the loop.
[54:55.840 --> 54:56.820]  What a load of bollocks.
[54:57.140 --> 54:58.020]  Where did I even go?
[54:58.140 --> 54:58.640]  No!
[55:01.980 --> 55:03.280]  Wait, I'm alive!
[55:03.600 --> 55:04.140]  No, stop!
[55:05.520 --> 55:06.640]  No, stop.
[55:08.080 --> 55:08.580]  Freedom!
[55:08.580 --> 55:10.180]  Wrong way!
[55:16.260 --> 55:17.640]  Was that a shortcut?
[55:18.340 --> 55:20.180]  Damn it, I can turn around fast enough.
[55:20.280 --> 55:22.240]  Geoff got sacked onto a shortcut.
[55:22.780 --> 55:24.020]  Backwards though.
[55:25.020 --> 55:25.700]  You!
[55:26.640 --> 55:26.900]  No!
[55:27.580 --> 55:28.900]  You better make it!
[55:29.560 --> 55:31.880]  What a move!
[55:32.640 --> 55:34.380]  What a move!
[55:34.600 --> 55:36.400]  Only points of getting on game.
[55:38.620 --> 55:39.220]  Dirty!
[55:40.240 --> 55:41.580]  Put on the score!
[55:42.040 --> 55:42.500]  Wow!
[55:44.340 --> 55:44.640]  Wow!
[55:45.200 --> 55:48.840]  You don't even know if Gavin comes. This is crazy.
[55:49.260 --> 55:49.860]  2075.
[55:50.860 --> 55:52.320]  I have it on good authority he does.
[55:59.330 --> 56:02.510]  I see that everybody picked other stuff to do.
[56:02.910 --> 56:05.450]  Why do we need more speed?
[56:07.570 --> 56:09.430]  No, that's a left and right.
[56:09.430 --> 56:11.770]  I put a trap down and I only killed myself.
[56:12.030 --> 56:13.710]  So I'm just blindly placing at this point.
[56:13.910 --> 56:14.470]  Oh my god.
[56:14.690 --> 56:16.810]  Right there, right there.
[56:16.870 --> 56:17.450]  We need the speed.
[56:19.750 --> 56:21.110]  That's some good speed there.
[56:21.690 --> 56:22.330]  It's good speed.
[56:22.510 --> 56:24.990]  But don't get confused by the right speed before it.
[56:28.370 --> 56:29.590]  Oh, come on!
[56:29.650 --> 56:30.430]  Don't even touch me!
[56:30.730 --> 56:32.130]  Explain yourself!
[56:32.850 --> 56:33.950]  That was a shotgun.
[56:36.130 --> 56:36.830]  I'm sorry.
[56:36.830 --> 56:39.050]  I'm sorry about that.
[56:39.050 --> 56:40.770]  I'm real sorry about that.
[56:42.090 --> 56:43.450]  I don't think you are.
[56:43.630 --> 56:44.190]  No, I'm not.
[56:44.390 --> 56:45.890]  Holy shit!
[56:46.930 --> 56:48.310]  Ah! Slam!
[56:51.050 --> 56:53.230]  Alright, time for speed!
[56:53.430 --> 56:53.870]  Speed!
[56:54.050 --> 56:55.810]  You killed me!
[56:56.010 --> 56:56.310]  How?
[56:57.550 --> 56:58.330]  Too much speed.
[56:59.670 --> 57:01.450]  Daddy's big now! No, I didn't make it!
[57:03.010 --> 57:04.250]  Stop touching me!
[57:04.250 --> 57:05.210]  Shortcut!
[57:05.690 --> 57:06.130]  Don't touch me!
[57:07.390 --> 57:08.750]  You bitch!
[57:09.950 --> 57:10.970]  Yes! No!
[57:11.730 --> 57:15.290]  God damn it!
[57:17.570 --> 57:20.130]  Five minutes away from the best time of the week!
[57:20.470 --> 57:21.650]  Five minutes!
[57:22.850 --> 57:23.930]  Don't touch me!
[57:24.690 --> 57:25.750]  Get me big!
[57:26.010 --> 57:27.790]  No! Big for the fall!
[57:31.990 --> 57:33.270]  Oh!
[57:37.630 --> 57:40.510]  You spawned and killed me somehow!
[57:41.870 --> 57:42.890]  Yes! No!
[57:44.250 --> 57:46.010]  Stop it!
[57:46.850 --> 57:48.670]  Okay, okay, okay.
[57:49.390 --> 57:50.670]  Bullshit!
[57:52.370 --> 57:53.650]  No!
[57:54.350 --> 57:55.430]  Oh no!
[57:55.430 --> 57:56.510]  Please!
[57:56.910 --> 57:57.070]  No!
[57:59.150 --> 58:00.290]  Stop shooting me!
[58:00.950 --> 58:01.290]  Ah!
[58:02.110 --> 58:07.210]  Alright, how can we...
[58:07.210 --> 58:08.310]  How can we...
[58:08.310 --> 58:09.430]  Come on! No!
[58:10.510 --> 58:11.110]  Put me there!
[58:11.790 --> 58:13.350]  Oh, it didn't give it to Geoff!
[58:13.350 --> 58:15.290]  I think I went too far.
[58:15.410 --> 58:15.870]  You did!
[58:18.090 --> 58:19.170]  The substance!
[58:20.570 --> 58:21.210]  Ow!
[58:21.210 --> 58:22.990]  I'm just loaded up!
[58:23.390 --> 58:25.130]  Oh! Who got sacked?
[58:25.210 --> 58:26.290]  I did, but I lived!
[58:26.510 --> 58:29.070]  I went through the thing! I crossed the line!
[58:30.650 --> 58:31.650]  Give me the finish!
[58:32.270 --> 58:32.870]  Give me the win!
[58:33.010 --> 58:33.750]  Give me the end!
[58:34.810 --> 58:35.610]  Stop him!
[58:36.110 --> 58:36.670]  Stop him!
[58:38.130 --> 58:38.650]  Yes!
[58:41.970 --> 58:43.290]  Look at that!
[58:44.910 --> 58:46.290]  That's so close!
[58:46.690 --> 58:48.410]  Alright, we have to kill Gavin at all costs!
[58:48.410 --> 58:50.390]  Whoa, that was crazy!
[58:51.930 --> 58:52.490]  We never got to see
[58:52.490 --> 58:53.450]  what Bull does.
[58:55.090 --> 58:55.210]  Where?
[58:56.810 --> 58:58.910]  Is that fire?
[58:59.390 --> 58:59.710]  Yeah!
[59:00.270 --> 59:00.630]  Wow!
[59:01.730 --> 59:02.090]  Yeah!
[59:04.070 --> 59:06.650]  Guys, thanks for watching! You can watch the VOD of this on Tuesday
[59:06.650 --> 59:07.690]  if you want to watch it later.
[59:08.850 --> 59:10.650]  I'm excited. This has been a great one.
[59:10.650 --> 59:12.210]  You should put it backwards. It has been a lot of fun.
[59:12.530 --> 59:13.570]  This has been a really fun one.
[59:13.690 --> 59:16.570]  I love video games that let
[59:16.570 --> 59:18.530]  whatever weird number of friends
[59:18.530 --> 59:19.950]  you have play. You know what I mean?
[59:20.330 --> 59:22.010]  Five is such a weird number
[59:22.010 --> 59:24.190]  outside of asymmetrical horror games.
[59:26.510 --> 59:28.810]  Oh my god, I got annihilated!
[59:28.990 --> 59:29.430]  No, no, no!
[59:30.310 --> 59:31.350]  Two minute warning!
[59:31.570 --> 59:33.270]  Two minutes to 5.01!
[59:34.210 --> 59:36.570]  I hate the beginning of every one we do.
[59:40.870 --> 59:41.590]  Oh no!
[59:46.590 --> 59:48.410]  God damn it.
[59:48.410 --> 59:49.910]  Give me the speed!
[59:51.050 --> 59:52.730]  Ultimate speed!
[59:53.330 --> 59:53.590]  No!
[59:55.490 --> 59:56.330]  No!
[59:57.410 --> 59:58.410]  Oh, come on.
[59:58.450 --> 01:00:00.350]  Please sir, stop shooting me!
[01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.050]  Oh god.
[01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:03.710]  What just happened?
[01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.650]  Why did you do that?
[01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:08.110]  What happened?
[01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:08.830]  What?
[01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.330]  I'm so...
[01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:14.330]  frustrated right now.
[01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:15.290]  Oh, is it frustrating?
[01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:18.450]  Not that you got it, Geoff.
[01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:21.990]  God damn it.
[01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:23.210]  Shortcut!
[01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.310]  None of us made it
[01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:27.470]  and then it killed Geoff.
[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.390]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:32.270]  It's like, well he didn't try
[01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.550]  for the shortcut, so fuck him.
[01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:36.010]  Shortcut! Made it.
[01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:37.630]  Sick. No way!
[01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:40.110]  I did it!
[01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:41.230]  Get off me.
[01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.370]  Goo, the substance!
[01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:44.610]  The goo!
[01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.650]  Lower! Damn it!
[01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:50.850]  Flippin' hell.
[01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:52.490]  One minute, one minute.
[01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:54.670]  Take that, Gavin.
[01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:56.370]  I did.
[01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.110]  No more substance.
[01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:04.790]  How was that?
[01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:06.510]  He tried to shoot...
[01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:08.690]  Don't touch me, don't touch me!
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:09.990]  Damn it.
[01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:11.550]  Get off me, get off!
[01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:13.870]  Stop tapping me, you twat!
[01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:14.410]  Stop it!
[01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:16.850]  No!
[01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:19.330]  You killed me, Gavin.
[01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:20.350]  You idiot!
[01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:22.890]  Stop hitting!
[01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:24.710]  No!
[01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.650]  What?
[01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.750]  Everyone's getting sacked!
[01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.030]  He got ballsacked!
[01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:32.430]  501 ballsack!
[01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.530]  501 ballsacking!
[01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:40.450]  Put me down!
[01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:41.690]  Where are the...
[01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:42.290]  No!
[01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.770]  It's the road.
[01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:48.530]  Yeah!
[01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:51.650]  This game is great!
[01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.270]  This game is so good!
[01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.270]  501 ballsacking for Nick.
[01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:59.650]  I got sacked right on the 501s.
[01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.170]  That's bullshit!
[01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:04.870]  I keep getting slapped away from the shortcut.
[01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:05.390]  Oh no!
[01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:08.430]  Stop touching me!
[01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:12.930]  Damn it.
[01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:14.370]  Damn it.
[01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:16.470]  Theme!
[01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:17.530]  Stop it!
[01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:19.610]  God!
[01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:23.030]  There's more of those!
[01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.430]  Where's the next jump?
[01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:26.390]  I'm scared!
[01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.010]  Here it is!
[01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:31.230]  What a way to end it!
[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:32.890]  What a way to finish!
[01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.810]  Did Theme get enough?
[01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:37.770]  No.
[01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.810]  Not even close.
[01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:40.850]  There's not a chance.
[01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:42.490]  Unless it gives me another comeback bonus.
[01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.930]  Look at that.
[01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:45.270]  Come on Geoff!
[01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.490]  I think I'm done.
[01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:50.070]  Yes!
[01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:52.970]  No!
[01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:54.710]  He did it!
[01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:56.490]  I'll take second place!
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.310]  Damn you with the win!
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:01.030]  Shortcuts for the win!
[01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:02.830]  Ladies and gentlemen.

[01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:32.770]  to be done with.
[01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:33.550]  This is incredible.
[01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:35.790]  Partial shortcuts are a real game changer.

[01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:56.670]  I never turned them off, you dumb fuck!
