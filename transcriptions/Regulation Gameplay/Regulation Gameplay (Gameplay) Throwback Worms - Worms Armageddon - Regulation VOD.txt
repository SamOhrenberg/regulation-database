[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Okay, well, we started. Here we are.
[00:05.820 --> 00:07.580]  If you're joining us...
[00:07.580 --> 00:08.680]  Oh, what the fuck was that?
[00:08.960 --> 00:10.360]  Like, why'd that start so soon?
[00:11.660 --> 00:15.880]  Alright, we're playing this for one round, then we're moving back to Worms WMD.
[00:17.400 --> 00:18.600]  Who is who?
[00:19.020 --> 00:21.120]  Dumb is ready to rumble. This looks like...
[00:21.960 --> 00:24.160]  If I had to guess, this is Andrew.
[00:24.160 --> 00:25.040]  What the fuck?
[00:25.520 --> 00:26.860]  Yellow? Oh my god.
[00:30.620 --> 00:31.060]  No!
[00:31.680 --> 00:32.900]  Oof, oof, oof.

[00:34.720 --> 00:35.940]  I'm 99 team.
[00:37.600 --> 00:39.420]  FuntChungle is now up. What's up, guys?
[00:39.720 --> 00:40.340]  That is FuntChungle.
[00:40.440 --> 00:44.260]  Welcome to the stream. We're playing old ass Worms, old school style.
[00:44.380 --> 00:44.980]  Not for long.
[00:44.980 --> 00:47.700]  Bad looking, ugly worms. Welcome to one round of this shit.
[00:49.040 --> 00:51.720]  Thank you guys so much for joining us. We appreciate it.
[00:51.840 --> 00:56.360]  And don't forget to join us this Sunday at 11am central. You idiot.
[00:58.220 --> 00:59.860]  FuntChungle, you stupid bitch.
[01:00.040 --> 01:02.600]  So the uh, inventory button is shoot.
[01:03.380 --> 01:04.720]  What is inventory button?
[01:04.800 --> 01:06.320]  Oh no, there's new buttons?
[01:08.080 --> 01:09.640]  I still don't know the old ones.
[01:10.240 --> 01:10.620]  Okay.
[01:11.540 --> 01:13.120]  Okay, wait, you can switch.
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.060]  You can switch characters?
[01:15.400 --> 01:15.780]  Apparently.
[01:16.440 --> 01:18.180]  Leave Ratty Boy alone!
[01:18.840 --> 01:20.400]  Yeah, I am Summer Movie.
[01:21.180 --> 01:23.200]  Summer Movie is playing. This is Eric.
[01:23.200 --> 01:25.160]  Hi fucking yeah!
[01:26.260 --> 01:29.100]  How did you get to the- how did you figure- how did you do that?
[01:29.600 --> 01:30.060]  I started-
[01:30.660 --> 01:31.220]  What do you mean?
[01:31.460 --> 01:32.640]  Punch him away from the water.
[01:32.740 --> 01:33.860]  What button did you hit to punch?
[01:33.860 --> 01:34.900]  Because I didn't know what I was doing.
[01:35.480 --> 01:35.760]  Oh.
[01:36.400 --> 01:36.660]  Yeah.
[01:36.820 --> 01:37.800]  But how did you hit him?
[01:38.440 --> 01:40.720]  I just walked up to him and started pressing buttons.
[01:41.300 --> 01:44.040]  FlyingMonkey40, who just gave us- who just subbed, they know.
[01:44.260 --> 01:45.280]  That was for you, FlyingMonkey40.
[01:45.820 --> 01:47.460]  Who is Iconic Brands?
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.160]  That's me.
[01:48.860 --> 01:51.700]  Iconic Brands, Nike, Apple, and Ratty Boy.
[01:53.260 --> 01:54.140]  Shut up.
[01:54.180 --> 01:54.660]  How do I-
[01:54.660 --> 01:55.160]  Stupid.
[01:55.360 --> 01:56.720]  Okay, here we-
[01:57.240 --> 01:58.640]  You gotta do the backwards jump, remember?
[01:58.740 --> 01:59.960]  What's the fucking backwards jump?
[02:01.060 --> 02:01.500]  Ballerina.
[02:02.360 --> 02:02.740]  Wah!
[02:02.920 --> 02:03.200]  Nope.
[02:03.400 --> 02:04.400]  Okay, uh.
[02:04.640 --> 02:05.020]  Okay.
[02:05.280 --> 02:05.580]  Wah!
[02:06.220 --> 02:08.100]  Take that, ballerina!
[02:08.960 --> 02:09.400]  Ballerina!
[02:09.640 --> 02:11.900]  Oh, that's what it's gonna do at the box office too, shoot.
[02:12.340 --> 02:14.700]  That's what you get for slapping him inwards.
[02:15.220 --> 02:15.440]  Yep, yeah.
[02:15.700 --> 02:17.420]  Didn't know- didn't know what I was doing.
[02:17.480 --> 02:18.460]  Just sort of hit buttons.
[02:19.160 --> 02:21.760]  Disney, Apple, Nike, Ratty Boy.
[02:22.080 --> 02:22.520]  Nike?
[02:22.900 --> 02:23.140]  Nike?
[02:23.680 --> 02:24.260]  Oh, am I me?
[02:24.620 --> 02:24.720]  Nike!
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.360]  Okay, I'll be me.
[02:25.880 --> 02:26.300]  Nike.
[02:27.140 --> 02:27.820]  I, uh...
[02:28.800 --> 02:29.240]  Nikay!
[02:30.840 --> 02:31.280]  Nike?
[02:32.500 --> 02:33.320]  Yeah, Nike.
[02:33.980 --> 02:35.100]  Come on, Geoff, what are you doing?
[02:35.700 --> 02:38.600]  This, uh, this game came out in 1999, so I-
[02:38.600 --> 02:39.420]  What does X do?
[02:39.560 --> 02:39.860]  Nothing.
[02:40.060 --> 02:40.380]  Jump.
[02:40.660 --> 02:40.780]  Fuck.
[02:41.640 --> 02:42.660]  Geoff, come on!
[02:43.120 --> 02:43.700]  Geoff, what's jump?
[02:43.800 --> 02:44.920]  Geoff, you only have 25 seconds!
[02:46.400 --> 02:47.200]  Happy anniversary!
[02:47.740 --> 02:49.640]  Did they update anything for the anniversary?
[02:49.840 --> 02:50.720]  Did you just say fucking-
[02:50.720 --> 02:51.540]  Oh, that wrench is-
[02:51.540 --> 02:51.640]  There you go!
[02:51.800 --> 02:52.800]  It has geometry.
[02:52.980 --> 02:53.260]  I thought it was-
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.260]  Dude, that was pretty good, dude.
[02:54.420 --> 02:55.520]  Oh, that was a background wrench.
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.340]  That's what stood on the wrench.
[02:57.500 --> 02:57.820]  What do you mean?
[02:58.180 --> 02:59.180]  You're stood on the wrench!
[02:59.260 --> 02:59.680]  Shut up!
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.200]  No, gum is stood on the wrench.
[03:02.260 --> 03:02.860]  Okay, here's cum.
[03:02.860 --> 03:03.680]  Hey, look, it's cumba.
[03:03.860 --> 03:04.140]  It's cumba.
[03:04.140 --> 03:04.640]  Who's cum?
[03:05.100 --> 03:05.680]  Who's cum?
[03:06.340 --> 03:06.580]  Oh.
[03:06.920 --> 03:08.280]  Alright, why is jump?
[03:09.400 --> 03:10.560]  Yeah, okay, I'm learning.
[03:10.920 --> 03:11.200]  Okay.
[03:12.200 --> 03:12.560]  Uh...
[03:12.560 --> 03:13.440]  What does A do?
[03:16.260 --> 03:17.260]  What does A do?
[03:18.120 --> 03:18.980]  Phoenician scheme.
[03:19.900 --> 03:21.420]  Yeah, dude, I got it!
[03:21.420 --> 03:21.840]  Yes!
[03:22.320 --> 03:23.660]  No, Phoenician scheme!
[03:26.400 --> 03:28.180]  I'm two worms down, boys.
[03:31.740 --> 03:32.180]  I'm-
[03:32.180 --> 03:33.920]  Binti spuds?
[03:34.240 --> 03:35.060]  It's Binti spuds.
[03:35.100 --> 03:36.000]  How do you open the-
[03:36.000 --> 03:36.920]  What do you pick the thing?
[03:37.300 --> 03:37.880]  I'm just-
[03:37.880 --> 03:39.080]  Binti spuds!
[03:39.440 --> 03:40.460]  I have no clue, dude.
[03:40.820 --> 03:41.460]  I wish I knew.
[03:41.920 --> 03:43.820]  I just have the rockets, so I'm going with that.
[03:43.840 --> 03:44.260]  Oh, here we go.
[03:44.560 --> 03:45.040]  Left trigger.
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.920]  Rectal Blitzkrieg 69-420 with five gifted.
[03:49.060 --> 03:52.280]  Thank you, Rectal Blitzkrieg 69-420.
[03:52.500 --> 03:53.900]  Rectal Blitzkrieg.
[03:54.220 --> 03:57.800]  Shaker's Fist, Crucified Donkey, Rectal Blitzkrieg.
[03:58.180 --> 03:59.420]  The game's all here.
[04:00.160 --> 04:02.140]  Hey, Iconic Brands is doing a lot of stuff-
[04:02.140 --> 04:02.260]  Oh!
[04:02.640 --> 04:03.100]  Shit!
[04:04.000 --> 04:04.140]  Oh!
[04:04.460 --> 04:06.860]  No, not Binti spuds.
[04:07.600 --> 04:09.620]  Binti spuds is in a pink sandwich.
[04:10.160 --> 04:12.300]  If you've just joined, we're playing Worms Anniversary.
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.080]  Worms is up again in Anniversary and we have no idea of the controls.
[04:16.500 --> 04:18.120]  Is there no forward jump?
[04:19.180 --> 04:20.220]  Uh, yeah, there is.
[04:20.860 --> 04:22.560]  How do you do- that's weird.
[04:23.520 --> 04:24.420]  I guess A?
[04:25.300 --> 04:27.580]  A is forward jump and Y is backward jump.
[04:28.060 --> 04:30.760]  I think Y is like directly up jump.
[04:30.840 --> 04:32.140]  Oh, up jump the boogie?
[04:32.580 --> 04:33.460]  Yeah, damn it.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.940]  You bastard, you beat me to it.
[04:35.340 --> 04:38.220]  If you press left trigger, you can see the stuff, even though it's not your turn.
[04:38.320 --> 04:38.720]  Boys, I missed.
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.620]  You gotta get up pretty early in the morning to be shittier at comedy than this guy.
[04:47.580 --> 04:48.600]  But, Stanky.
[04:50.540 --> 04:51.540]  Five gifted subs.
[04:52.780 --> 04:53.640]  Thank you, Stanky.
[04:54.700 --> 04:55.340]  Thank you, Stanky.
[04:55.340 --> 04:57.120]  This is for Stanky.
[04:57.160 --> 04:58.140]  If I figure out how to jump.
[04:58.740 --> 04:59.640]  How do I-
[04:59.640 --> 05:01.220]  You're jumping straight in the fucking ocean.
[05:01.940 --> 05:04.180]  He wasn't paying attention when we were talking about it earlier.
[05:05.700 --> 05:07.700]  Maybe if you hit him hard enough, he'll bounce back.
[05:09.160 --> 05:12.420]  We were just talking about it, and he wasn't paying attention.
[05:12.940 --> 05:14.200]  There you go.
[05:14.220 --> 05:14.720]  There you go.
[05:14.800 --> 05:15.600]  Now punch the shit-
[05:15.600 --> 05:16.220]  Not TLC.
[05:16.700 --> 05:17.100]  There you go.
[05:17.540 --> 05:18.820]  They've suffered enough loss.
[05:19.260 --> 05:20.360]  Yeah, they'll go chase some waterfalls.
[05:21.620 --> 05:23.100]  Oh my god.
[05:24.640 --> 05:25.380]  Is he gonna do it?
[05:26.020 --> 05:27.000]  Turn the other way, fool.
[05:28.540 --> 05:30.100]  No, no, no, no.
[05:31.740 --> 05:32.620]  Ready, boys!
[05:36.080 --> 05:36.960]  Ready, boys!
[05:37.700 --> 05:40.200]  And that's the way Ratty Boy goes down.
[05:40.760 --> 05:41.760]  Ratty Boy!
[05:43.540 --> 05:44.060]  Good.
[05:44.580 --> 05:47.640]  You fired yourself out of that cave like a bullet.
[05:48.000 --> 05:48.890]  Oh my god.
[05:49.320 --> 05:50.500]  Poor Ratty.
[05:51.340 --> 05:51.860]  Good.
[05:55.300 --> 05:59.520]  If you're watching us play one round of this game, thank you for being here live.
[06:00.100 --> 06:04.300]  Don't forget, we'll be streaming at 11am central right here on Twitch.
[06:04.300 --> 06:11.020]  We'll be doing a bunch of different stuff like cool surprises and stuff, but we'll be playing a 30-turn Mario party.
[06:11.280 --> 06:13.060]  That's gonna be the big main event.
[06:13.200 --> 06:20.300]  But we also have some cool surprises that are coming out tomorrow on our gameplay channel, so keep your eyes peeled for that also.
[06:21.140 --> 06:27.440]  There's a lot. This is a fun weekend, because tomorrow marks one year of all of us getting shit-canned from a company on my birthday.
[06:27.440 --> 06:35.540]  And then Sunday is one year of us starting a cool company that has been a lot of fun and I really love being a part of.
[06:35.840 --> 06:38.520]  B Ford says, happy anniversary with 1000 Bits. Thank you so much.
[06:38.640 --> 06:39.540]  Thank you so much.
[06:40.120 --> 06:41.480]  How do I change again?
[06:41.700 --> 06:42.180]  Happy birthday, Eric.
[06:42.180 --> 06:43.300]  Left trigger, Nick.
[06:43.300 --> 06:45.580]  Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate that.
[06:45.620 --> 06:46.780]  That year flew by.
[06:47.540 --> 06:52.040]  Yeah, it really did. I was talking to our CPAs about it, and they were like, we can't believe it's been a year.
[06:52.160 --> 06:54.340]  And it's like, hey, you're telling me. Imagine working here.
[06:55.720 --> 06:57.400]  Come on. You got it.
[06:57.480 --> 06:58.360]  Oh, hell yeah.
[06:58.700 --> 07:00.180]  Buy Bumpy Squam or whatever it is.
[07:00.180 --> 07:09.840]  Yeah, buy Bumpy Squam. Without getting into the particulars of talking to the CPAs, they did say that we are a real company. That was pretty cool.
[07:10.180 --> 07:10.820]  That's insane.
[07:11.300 --> 07:16.220]  And I think me and Geoff both sat there going, holy shit, really? I mean, it's been a year, but really?
[07:16.500 --> 07:16.920]  For real?
[07:17.040 --> 07:17.220]  Really special.
[07:17.620 --> 07:17.800]  Yeah.
[07:18.220 --> 07:21.260]  They're like, no, you're not. This is not illegal. You're on the other end.
[07:21.420 --> 07:22.280]  Sweet. I like that.
[07:22.280 --> 07:24.240]  You're allowed to do this, is what they kept saying.
[07:24.580 --> 07:24.700]  Yeah.
[07:24.900 --> 07:25.660]  Hell yeah.
[07:29.480 --> 07:30.080]  You sheep in?
[07:30.080 --> 07:30.960]  Should I do it this way?
[07:31.540 --> 07:33.700]  Yeah, send the sheep. Do it, baby.
[07:33.760 --> 07:34.700]  Send out Lamby.
[07:36.340 --> 07:37.300]  Um, do you have a Lamby?
[07:38.780 --> 07:39.040]  Uh oh.
[07:39.080 --> 07:40.240]  Oh, what a jump.
[07:41.080 --> 07:41.100]  Uh oh.
[07:41.400 --> 07:42.540]  Backstreet Boys are safe.
[07:44.500 --> 07:47.020]  Oh, shit.
[07:47.920 --> 07:48.680]  In Backstreet Boys.
[07:49.060 --> 07:49.800]  How did that go?
[07:49.800 --> 07:53.100]  Oh, my Morgz, thanks for five gifted subs.
[07:53.260 --> 07:54.580]  Thank you so much.
[07:54.680 --> 07:55.980]  Superman time, baby.
[07:56.480 --> 07:57.520]  I'm no Superman.
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.160]  I'm no Superman.
[08:03.200 --> 08:07.800]  That song is perpetually stuck in my head because I fell asleep with a DVD on.
[08:08.380 --> 08:08.940]  Beans!
[08:12.180 --> 08:16.040]  Yeah, those Scrubs DVDs looped.
[08:16.480 --> 08:19.240]  I hurt myself almost as much as I hurt Spungle Chubf.
[08:20.380 --> 08:23.280]  Be careful Spungle Chubf. He's, uh...
[08:23.280 --> 08:23.940]  He's delicate.
[08:24.200 --> 08:26.280]  This game is growing on me now that I know about left trigger.
[08:26.960 --> 08:27.900]  Oh, shit, that's me.
[08:29.900 --> 08:31.080]  I was afraid.
[08:31.160 --> 08:31.720]  It was like...
[08:31.720 --> 08:33.100]  Do you remember Soul Dat?
[08:33.220 --> 08:34.860]  We used to play that in the early days of Rooster Teeth.
[08:35.140 --> 08:36.120]  Might have been before your time, Gavin.
[08:36.820 --> 08:37.360]  Before my time.
[08:37.700 --> 08:40.280]  Before your time at...
[08:40.280 --> 08:41.340]  At Achieving Records?
[08:41.640 --> 08:42.260]  What are you talking about?
[08:42.580 --> 08:43.720]  Before it's time at Rooster Teeth.
[08:43.920 --> 08:45.240]  Oh, oh, oh, I see.
[08:45.940 --> 08:46.740]  Holy shit.
[08:46.820 --> 08:47.880]  I just stepped on that line.
[08:47.880 --> 08:51.680]  I thought I, like, activated it for vehicles or something.
[08:51.780 --> 08:52.480]  I wasn't sure.
[08:53.060 --> 08:54.740]  I don't think vehicle bites were invented yet.
[08:55.100 --> 08:56.320]  Smash Mouth. Shadow Alliance.
[08:56.520 --> 08:57.160]  Shadow Alliance.
[08:57.520 --> 08:59.500]  Smash Mouth. Hit Funk Chungle or whatever.
[09:00.020 --> 09:00.740]  Shadow Alliance.
[09:01.540 --> 09:02.580]  Not Funt Chungle.
[09:03.140 --> 09:04.740]  Drop a grenade on Funt Boy.
[09:06.700 --> 09:08.920]  Uh, okay. Let's go, uh...
[09:08.920 --> 09:09.240]  Ooh.
[09:10.060 --> 09:12.140]  I was having fun...
[09:12.140 --> 09:14.240]  Funt Chungle's really hurt.
[09:14.240 --> 09:16.240]  Uh-oh.
[09:18.040 --> 09:19.220]  I'll go hang out over here with my buddies.
[09:19.800 --> 09:20.060]  Uh-oh.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.260]  She caught me too close.
[09:21.960 --> 09:22.180]  What?
[09:22.440 --> 09:22.680]  Damn it.
[09:22.840 --> 09:23.260]  There you go.
[09:24.360 --> 09:25.240]  Oh my gosh.
[09:26.300 --> 09:29.840]  Arthritic Gamer with 10 gifted as Superman takes damage.
[09:29.980 --> 09:32.200]  But that's okay because he's going to win in the box office, baby.
[09:32.640 --> 09:32.740]  Oh, dear.
[09:32.740 --> 09:33.680]  Thank you so much.
[09:35.460 --> 09:37.300]  What ever will I do?
[09:38.040 --> 09:39.400]  I wish this kind of told me what she was.
[09:39.400 --> 09:40.300]  Nike and Superman.
[09:44.240 --> 09:47.580]  Nick is pretty far in the lead in the summer movie draft.
[09:48.240 --> 09:48.640]  Yeah.
[09:49.120 --> 09:50.540]  Well, he picked all the movies.
[09:50.540 --> 09:51.360]  I think I've got $28.
[09:52.180 --> 09:52.580]  Yeah.
[09:52.660 --> 09:53.940]  Money you didn't spend at the end.
[09:53.980 --> 09:54.100]  Yeah.
[09:54.260 --> 09:54.600]  Exactly.
[09:55.620 --> 09:56.980]  You're looking down at Funt...
[09:56.980 --> 09:57.240]  Okay.
[09:57.480 --> 09:57.900]  Yeah, no.
[09:58.060 --> 09:58.440]  Superman's good.
[09:58.740 --> 09:59.620]  No, not Superman.
[09:59.740 --> 10:01.120]  You want Funt Chungle or whatever.
[10:01.220 --> 10:01.840]  Why are you doing that?
[10:04.140 --> 10:04.940]  Funt Chungle?
[10:05.980 --> 10:07.480]  What is that thing?
[10:08.040 --> 10:08.700]  It's just fire.
[10:09.000 --> 10:09.560]  That was crazy.
[10:09.820 --> 10:10.280]  Oh, you lit it up.
[10:10.640 --> 10:12.340]  My penis is getting burnt, though.
[10:12.380 --> 10:12.700]  It did.
[10:12.760 --> 10:13.220]  My nuts.
[10:15.460 --> 10:16.260]  When will it go out?
[10:16.400 --> 10:17.720]  I don't know if I've ever seen a Molotov.
[10:17.740 --> 10:19.140]  It's burning up your Funt.
[10:19.620 --> 10:24.780]  I will say this game looks like shit, but that audio is crispy in a way I really like.
[10:24.860 --> 10:25.040]  Yeah.
[10:25.100 --> 10:26.960]  I miss things that sound that way.
[10:28.060 --> 10:29.180]  How do I move Skit Worm?
[10:29.260 --> 10:29.980]  How do I move the...
[10:29.980 --> 10:32.740]  So, are these the graphics for the game?
[10:33.300 --> 10:33.700]  Right trigger.
[10:34.240 --> 10:34.740]  I think so.
[10:34.940 --> 10:35.320]  As opposed to what?
[10:35.860 --> 10:36.360]  Did you never play it?
[10:36.360 --> 10:36.840]  I don't know.
[10:37.020 --> 10:39.780]  Are these remastered or is this just what the game looks like?
[10:39.780 --> 10:41.140]  This is what it looked like, I think.
[10:41.440 --> 10:41.520]  Damn.
[10:41.940 --> 10:42.480]  That's crazy.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.280]  So, they just tricked us into more money?
[10:45.140 --> 10:45.780]  Yeah, it worked.
[10:46.200 --> 10:46.680]  Yeah, look at this.
[10:47.140 --> 10:49.240]  I assume it's more HD than it was.
[10:49.480 --> 10:49.660]  Yeah.
[10:49.720 --> 10:50.300]  What is it?
[10:50.740 --> 10:51.760]  Oh, it's widescreen.
[10:52.160 --> 10:52.300]  Yeah.
[10:53.960 --> 10:55.040]  You gonna do something, Funt?
[10:55.840 --> 10:56.700]  Yeah, check this out.
[10:56.780 --> 10:57.260]  Oh, shit.
[10:58.080 --> 10:58.440]  Well...
[10:58.440 --> 10:59.740]  Yeah, you can't jump...
[10:59.740 --> 11:00.460]  Yeah, you got it.
[11:00.740 --> 11:01.020]  Three...
[11:01.020 --> 11:01.560]  Whoa!
[11:02.940 --> 11:03.300]  Whoa!
[11:05.500 --> 11:05.740]  Whoa!
[11:06.380 --> 11:06.740]  Funt!
[11:07.140 --> 11:08.140]  There's a big gumskid.
[11:08.360 --> 11:09.000]  Gum is drowned.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.940]  Dude, Michael Phelps.
[11:11.020 --> 11:13.200]  Michael Phelps is here and he's gifted five stars.
[11:13.660 --> 11:15.340]  Thank you so much, Michael Phelps.
[11:15.580 --> 11:16.420]  Swimming in with five.
[11:16.820 --> 11:17.300]  Wow.
[11:18.960 --> 11:21.200]  Oh, man.
[11:21.480 --> 11:21.960]  Stupid.
[11:22.420 --> 11:23.680]  That's not the real Michael Phelps.
[11:24.020 --> 11:24.460]  Oh, okay.
[11:24.460 --> 11:25.100]  Well, you don't know that.
[11:25.540 --> 11:26.320]  I don't know that.
[11:27.560 --> 11:28.360]  Oh, not there.
[11:29.740 --> 11:30.720]  Oh, yeah, there.
[11:31.660 --> 11:32.560]  Glock Gunners?
[11:32.620 --> 11:33.200]  What do you mean?
[11:33.860 --> 11:34.240]  Oh!
[11:35.660 --> 11:36.140]  Jesus.
[11:37.300 --> 11:39.020]  Wow, Backstreet Boys hurting.
[11:40.020 --> 11:41.000]  Here comes Disney.
[11:42.180 --> 11:44.020]  Okay, we're trying something new.
[11:44.760 --> 11:46.300]  You gonna raise your prices again?
[11:47.480 --> 11:48.700]  Oh, that's old.
[11:49.700 --> 11:51.620]  Dude, the Dr. Mouse five gifted.
[11:51.840 --> 11:52.360]  This is great.
[11:52.540 --> 11:53.000]  This is...
[11:53.000 --> 11:53.320]  Uh-oh.
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.020]  Andrew's about to invest in theme parks.
[11:55.020 --> 11:55.380]  No!
[11:55.920 --> 11:56.000]  No!
[12:00.260 --> 12:02.040]  That's Disney raising their prices.
[12:03.260 --> 12:03.840]  Good lord.
[12:03.840 --> 12:04.900]  He's trying to bungee jump.
[12:06.140 --> 12:08.120]  Did you already thank Dung Bungalow?
[12:08.180 --> 12:08.480]  Oh, yeah.
[12:08.580 --> 12:09.640]  Dung Bungalow, thank you.
[12:09.740 --> 12:11.460]  You don't want to miss Dung Bungalow.
[12:11.780 --> 12:15.100]  That'd be like missing Medusa's pubic snakes.
[12:15.920 --> 12:18.220]  Did you know on Disney...
[12:18.220 --> 12:19.460]  Jesus Christ.
[12:20.480 --> 12:21.580]  Did you know on Disney...
[12:21.580 --> 12:22.020]  No.
[12:22.700 --> 12:23.060]  No.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.220]  No, you're fine.
[12:26.440 --> 12:29.300]  So, she's got like a snake minge?
[12:30.560 --> 12:31.040]  Ugh.
[12:33.180 --> 12:37.560]  Dung Bungalow is so close to one of Michael's 2012 worms that was called Dung Bingo.
[12:38.100 --> 12:40.540]  That does sound pretty good.
[12:41.240 --> 12:42.780]  A jet pack in this game?
[12:44.600 --> 12:45.080]  Uh...
[12:45.080 --> 12:47.360]  It's also if you just jump off a ledge.
[12:47.580 --> 12:48.380]  There's ninja rope.
[12:48.540 --> 12:49.780]  That sounds like horse shit.
[12:50.460 --> 12:51.320]  There's bungee.
[12:51.760 --> 12:53.020]  That does absolutely sound like horse shit.
[12:53.520 --> 12:54.360]  You know what?
[12:55.680 --> 12:56.500]  Just for that.
[12:56.740 --> 12:56.940]  Yeah.
[12:57.380 --> 12:58.080]  He might be real, though.
[13:03.800 --> 13:05.440]  It wasn't Peef Ring...
[13:05.440 --> 13:08.620]  It wasn't Peef Ring God, it was Peef Rim God, wasn't it?
[13:08.880 --> 13:09.640]  That's pretty good.
[13:10.300 --> 13:11.420]  That sounds like a Star Wars...
[13:11.420 --> 13:13.340]  That just sounds like a normal Star Wars character.
[13:13.960 --> 13:14.520]  What the fuck am I doing?
[13:14.520 --> 13:20.500]  Gavin has an encyclopedic knowledge of names from 30 minute worms games in 2012.
[13:21.380 --> 13:23.200]  I have no idea what I'm doing.
[13:23.240 --> 13:25.680]  But he wouldn't tell us if the games had more than four players.
[13:25.840 --> 13:28.440]  I can't remember that part of it specifically.
[13:28.580 --> 13:29.860]  Did you just blow your fucking turn?
[13:30.300 --> 13:32.260]  Yeah, I fucking couldn't figure out what to do.
[13:32.260 --> 13:33.080]  Are you fucking crazy?
[13:33.080 --> 13:35.560]  What do you mean you couldn't figure out what?
[13:35.680 --> 13:36.200]  Oh, it's me!
[13:36.420 --> 13:37.380]  Shit, I've just been stood here.
[13:37.580 --> 13:38.100]  Ah, shit!
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.740]  None of us were saying anything.
[13:40.080 --> 13:40.320]  No!
[13:41.420 --> 13:42.840]  I killed myself!
[13:43.380 --> 13:44.260]  Son of a bitch!
[13:44.440 --> 13:46.520]  The infantry isn't B, it sucks!
[13:49.700 --> 13:51.000]  Son of a bitch!
[13:53.000 --> 13:53.740]  Oh, man.
[13:57.620 --> 13:58.580]  You just...
[13:58.580 --> 14:00.220]  You just...
[14:00.220 --> 14:01.460]  Oh my God, that was great.
[14:02.260 --> 14:08.700]  So on Disney+, they have this thing where if you set it to a kid's account, a lot of Disney movies aren't available on it.
[14:08.800 --> 14:10.160]  Like old cartoon movies.
[14:10.160 --> 14:11.500]  It's probably appropriate, like Condorman.
[14:12.440 --> 14:18.360]  Well, sure, but I mean like old animated movies from the 90s or whatever.
[14:18.560 --> 14:19.660]  You can't always get those.
[14:19.940 --> 14:20.700]  Like Fix the Cat?
[14:21.660 --> 14:24.880]  Right, but if you don't do that and you assign...
[14:24.880 --> 14:25.100]  Ah!
[14:30.780 --> 14:33.100]  You can assign certain ratings to things.
[14:33.200 --> 14:39.160]  But I remember I assigned like, okay, don't have any adult or mature stuff available on Archie's account.
[14:39.600 --> 14:42.820]  And then I loaded into it one day to put something on for him, like Bluey or whatever.
[14:42.960 --> 14:46.260]  And it's like, the first thing that popped up was like, inside the towers on 9-11.
[14:46.360 --> 14:47.400]  It's like, what the fuck?
[14:50.220 --> 14:50.640]  Wow.
[14:51.200 --> 14:52.900]  Archie's a truther before he's two.
[14:53.100 --> 14:53.880]  Oh, God!
[14:55.140 --> 14:57.140]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[14:57.900 --> 15:00.460]  Dad, I want to tell you about the second tower.
[15:01.240 --> 15:02.560]  No, Archie, no!
[15:02.980 --> 15:04.080]  No, Archie, no!
[15:07.420 --> 15:13.720]  Dad, I've been listening to Jesse Ventura. He's got some really innovative ideas.
[15:14.940 --> 15:17.160]  Dad, we need to go down to Mexico.
[15:17.960 --> 15:18.600]  Oh, teleport.
[15:19.820 --> 15:21.080]  How the hell did you do that?
[15:21.960 --> 15:23.040]  I don't know.
[15:23.040 --> 15:24.340]  Wait, I think he used teleport.
[15:24.860 --> 15:27.040]  I think teleport's not in the newer games, is it?
[15:27.320 --> 15:28.540]  I don't know.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.040]  It is or it isn't.
[15:30.800 --> 15:31.360]  I'm not sure.
[15:31.760 --> 15:34.640]  Jet fuel can't melt steel beams, Dad.
[15:37.300 --> 15:39.960]  Spock's jungle's actually stood on the background, so don't shoot it.
[15:40.260 --> 15:40.760]  Oh, man.
[15:43.040 --> 15:45.980]  Yeah, I heard that's a background wrench.
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.300]  Yeah, that's a background wrench.
[15:48.260 --> 15:48.840]  That's what I heard.
[15:49.420 --> 15:50.700]  No, Superman, no!
[15:53.140 --> 15:54.020]  Spring bingles!
[15:54.680 --> 15:55.740]  Hit him, not me!
[15:55.920 --> 15:57.000]  That's my last worm!
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.960]  Turns out he's no Superman.
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.200]  I can't do this all on my own.
[16:04.620 --> 16:06.100]  Okay, 36 is still alive.
[16:07.640 --> 16:08.320]  Maybe he can.
[16:08.800 --> 16:10.820]  What will bum and cum do on the side?
[16:11.340 --> 16:13.120]  Oh, hopefully this time they'll do something.
[16:14.780 --> 16:16.480]  Oh, my morgues with more gifted subs.
[16:16.540 --> 16:17.480]  This is getting wild in here.
[16:18.520 --> 16:19.940]  Not even our anniversary yet.
[16:20.240 --> 16:21.120]  Not yet, give it time.
[16:23.040 --> 16:24.060]  Pretty close, though.
[16:24.780 --> 16:26.600]  How do I want to play this?
[16:27.020 --> 16:28.020]  Play away from Gluck.
[16:30.020 --> 16:35.260]  We posted the video of that patch shirt on Instagram or, I guess, everywhere.
[16:36.120 --> 16:38.360]  We should put that on YouTube Shorts if we haven't yet.
[16:38.900 --> 16:47.060]  I tagged Natalie and I just said, make sure everyone sees this because it just starts with Graham, a guy that nobody knows and didn't want to be on camera.
[16:48.480 --> 16:50.220]  Did we ask him if we could post that?
[16:50.220 --> 16:51.560]  Yeah, it was just, here's Graham.
[16:51.760 --> 16:55.680]  It just, it just, like, Geoff filming Graham for no reason.
[16:55.800 --> 16:56.460]  It's really exciting.
[16:59.940 --> 17:01.260]  This, this is the reason.
[17:01.780 --> 17:02.540]  Makes great content.
[17:03.340 --> 17:04.300]  It inspires conversation.
[17:05.520 --> 17:05.980]  There you go.
[17:06.140 --> 17:07.120]  Oh, there's teleport. Okay.
[17:07.800 --> 17:08.620]  Apple's about to die.
[17:09.380 --> 17:10.100]  What's this?
[17:10.720 --> 17:11.620]  Napalm strike.
[17:12.540 --> 17:13.220]  Oh, lord.
[17:14.260 --> 17:15.120]  That's interesting.
[17:16.700 --> 17:17.460]  How do I?
[17:18.640 --> 17:19.140]  No.
[17:19.440 --> 17:20.040]  Yeah, do it that way.
[17:20.500 --> 17:21.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:21.500 --> 17:21.840]  There you go.
[17:22.020 --> 17:22.140]  No.
[17:22.520 --> 17:22.920]  Gavin.
[17:23.380 --> 17:23.580]  Yeah.
[17:23.880 --> 17:24.340]  What's up, Nick?
[17:24.940 --> 17:25.040]  Okay.
[17:25.520 --> 17:26.160]  Shadow Alliance.
[17:26.720 --> 17:28.020]  Oh, Shadow Alliance.
[17:29.140 --> 17:30.620]  Schindler's Fist is back, baby.
[17:30.720 --> 17:31.240]  One year.
[17:31.580 --> 17:32.300]  Oh, no.
[17:32.740 --> 17:33.220]  Oh, no.
[17:34.400 --> 17:34.640]  Whoa.
[17:36.580 --> 17:37.080]  Whoa.
[17:37.080 --> 17:37.180]  Whoa.
[17:38.100 --> 17:38.600]  Damn.
[17:39.180 --> 17:40.920]  Oh, come and bumble the early worms.
[17:41.300 --> 17:41.620]  Yes.
[17:41.620 --> 17:41.840]  Oh, no.
[17:41.900 --> 17:42.380]  I'm sorry.
[17:46.460 --> 17:46.880]  Wow.
[17:48.340 --> 17:49.680]  That was crazy.
[17:50.060 --> 17:52.220]  I didn't know you were running with come and bum only.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.300]  Just pure anger.
[17:55.800 --> 17:56.020]  Wow.
[17:58.520 --> 17:59.980]  I've spared Glock Hunters.
[18:01.540 --> 18:02.140]  You did.
[18:02.280 --> 18:03.760]  But there'll be another game after this, Nick.
[18:04.300 --> 18:04.720]  Great.
[18:05.060 --> 18:07.120]  You know, it's our anniversary in two days.
[18:07.280 --> 18:08.260]  We're very excited about it.
[18:08.280 --> 18:09.680]  The day we started the regulation company.
[18:10.380 --> 18:11.660]  And that's all cool and all.
[18:11.660 --> 18:14.940]  But we were talking about how tomorrow is your birthday, Eric.
[18:15.020 --> 18:16.480]  And also the day we all got fired.
[18:16.620 --> 18:16.940]  Yep.
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.280]  Nobody talks about May 9th.
[18:20.300 --> 18:21.800]  Do you remember what May 9th was?
[18:21.860 --> 18:23.620]  It was the day before all of that.
[18:23.740 --> 18:25.020]  So, we just felt fucked.
[18:25.560 --> 18:25.880]  Oh, yeah.
[18:25.900 --> 18:26.780]  It was just a bad day.
[18:26.860 --> 18:27.260]  Absolutely.
[18:27.460 --> 18:29.020]  There was no birthday, at least.
[18:29.560 --> 18:33.940]  It was just a shitty day knowing that we were going to wake up in 24 hours and get fired.
[18:34.220 --> 18:34.440]  Yep.
[18:34.600 --> 18:36.860]  It was just like, okay, we're almost there.
[18:37.020 --> 18:38.220]  Schindler's Fist 10 gifted.
[18:38.580 --> 18:39.060]  Schindler's Fist.
[18:39.080 --> 18:39.480]  Whoa.
[18:39.840 --> 18:40.320]  He's back.
[18:40.320 --> 18:45.700]  Yeah, it was just like, okay, well, I guess tomorrow's the last day.
[18:45.860 --> 18:46.520]  What is today?
[18:46.840 --> 18:49.480]  Who gives a shit about the second to last day?
[18:49.600 --> 18:51.820]  I feel like the whole last six weeks were that.
[18:52.040 --> 18:52.500]  It was.
[18:52.580 --> 18:53.540]  It was so much.
[18:53.780 --> 18:56.500]  But you always think about the day something happened.
[18:56.700 --> 19:00.380]  But very rarely do you remember the day before it happened, which was probably just as shitty.
[19:00.680 --> 19:01.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[19:02.500 --> 19:02.940]  Andrew!
[19:03.340 --> 19:04.320]  Unless you just didn't know.
[19:04.740 --> 19:04.860]  Yeah.
[19:05.900 --> 19:06.860]  Oh, my God!
[19:07.240 --> 19:08.180]  Oh, there we go.
[19:08.340 --> 19:09.040]  Got him in it.
[19:09.040 --> 19:09.380]  Bungle!
[19:09.740 --> 19:10.100]  Bungle!
[19:10.100 --> 19:10.820]  Oh, my God.
[19:11.300 --> 19:12.720]  Burning him up 98 degrees.
[19:13.020 --> 19:13.780]  I'm gonna be fine.
[19:13.780 --> 19:13.800]  I'm gonna be fine.
[19:14.120 --> 19:15.320]  I'm accustomed to this temperature.
[19:17.560 --> 19:18.280]  Oh, 99.
[19:18.720 --> 19:20.160]  That'd have been awesome if it had hit 98.
[19:20.560 --> 19:21.700]  Santa with the bibs.
[19:21.780 --> 19:23.180]  Wow, we're at level 10 on the hype train.
[19:23.580 --> 19:24.580]  Or, I'm sorry, level 12?
[19:24.720 --> 19:25.160]  What the hell?
[19:25.320 --> 19:26.200]  We're still going on the hype train?
[19:26.720 --> 19:27.380]  Yeah, this is nuts.
[19:27.940 --> 19:28.360]  That's crazy.
[19:28.880 --> 19:31.720]  And Noodle Neck ensured that it kept going with 5 gifted.
[19:32.000 --> 19:32.200]  Wild.
[19:32.220 --> 19:33.260]  Thank you so much, Noodle Neck.
[19:33.480 --> 19:34.260]  This is crazy.
[19:34.840 --> 19:36.700]  I'll temporarily call it the Noodle Train.
[19:37.580 --> 19:38.460]  The Noodle Train?
[19:38.460 --> 19:39.100]  Yeah.
[19:41.980 --> 19:45.360]  Isn't the changing the arrow the weirdest way they could have implemented that?
[19:45.540 --> 19:45.760]  Yes, absolutely.
[19:46.120 --> 19:46.660]  Oh, wow.
[19:46.860 --> 19:47.440]  The wind.
[19:48.240 --> 19:50.460]  Oh, no, Apple!
[19:54.720 --> 19:56.740]  I never think about the wind.
[19:57.140 --> 19:58.640]  I always forget that that's a thing.
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.520]  Oh, there's wind.
[20:00.780 --> 20:03.220]  It really affects the bazookas, I think.
[20:03.780 --> 20:04.240]  Wow.
[20:05.400 --> 20:07.380]  Alright, spunk jungle, whatever.
[20:07.380 --> 20:08.720]  Fucking blow these guys up.
[20:10.140 --> 20:10.540]  Okay.
[20:10.920 --> 20:16.620]  Dude, Juggs McTuggs is here with a 9 month subscriber Juggs McTuggs.
[20:18.920 --> 20:21.120]  I think I might make a Worms team.
[20:21.400 --> 20:24.560]  I think I might make a Worms team that's just regulation viewers.
[20:24.940 --> 20:30.200]  Because I think if we had Crucified Donkey, Schindler's Fist, Juggs McTuggs, and more on there.
[20:30.220 --> 20:30.720]  That's a squad.
[20:31.640 --> 20:34.720]  That's just a squad of asterisks at that point, isn't it?
[20:36.460 --> 20:37.260]  Juggs McTuggs.
[20:37.260 --> 20:38.320]  What you got there?
[20:38.640 --> 20:39.460]  Pick a worm.
[20:40.140 --> 20:40.740]  Spencer the built guy.
[20:40.940 --> 20:41.800]  Uh, Smash Mouth.
[20:43.300 --> 20:44.640]  Can't get enough of you, baby.
[20:45.400 --> 20:46.420]  Oh my god.
[20:46.560 --> 20:47.340]  Oh my god.
[20:48.100 --> 20:48.540]  Wow.
[20:50.900 --> 20:51.560]  I'm nude struck.
[20:54.370 --> 20:56.030]  Wow, that actually did damage.
[21:00.390 --> 21:01.650]  I changed the voice.
[21:02.290 --> 21:03.590]  You didn't know you could change the voice?
[21:04.870 --> 21:05.830]  Be careful, Superman.
[21:06.370 --> 21:07.150]  Didn't think to do anything.
[21:11.160 --> 21:12.360]  Oh, he's going down.
[21:14.120 --> 21:16.760]  MNudstrup showing up every week with 10 gifts and stuff.
[21:17.000 --> 21:17.480]  Big time.
[21:17.660 --> 21:18.200]  Thank you so much.
[21:18.940 --> 21:19.900]  Thank you!
[21:23.100 --> 21:24.940]  Gonna have to gluck that udder.
[21:25.860 --> 21:26.540]  Oh, shit.
[21:26.980 --> 21:28.520]  The udder's been fully glucked.
[21:28.600 --> 21:30.200]  Geoff, we got Mark the Frog in here.
[21:30.720 --> 21:31.780]  Oh, what's up, Mark the Frog?
[21:32.280 --> 21:34.580]  Probably laying some HVAC line.
[21:36.140 --> 21:37.320]  Digging a trench.
[21:37.320 --> 21:44.720]  We were streaming yesterday, and I found out that everything that Mark the Frog does in chat is voice-to-text.
[21:45.180 --> 21:48.480]  He says out loud everything that he types.
[21:50.420 --> 21:53.340]  Mark the Frog lore is so deep, it's crazy.
[21:53.760 --> 21:54.820]  I cannot get enough.
[21:56.400 --> 21:59.860]  Do you think Regulation should eventually produce a documentary about Mark the Frog?
[22:00.040 --> 22:00.360]  Yes.
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.300]  He said that he was rushing home yesterday for dinner because his wife saved him 6A.
[22:08.860 --> 22:09.300]  Wow!
[22:10.700 --> 22:12.320]  Dude, in this economy?
[22:13.360 --> 22:14.240]  Oh, man.
[22:14.520 --> 22:15.640]  What are you gonna do with 6 eggs?
[22:16.140 --> 22:16.960]  Eat them, man!
[22:17.160 --> 22:17.720]  Make an omelette?
[22:18.500 --> 22:21.460]  Yeah, dude! Mark the Frog's going crazy on it.
[22:23.480 --> 22:30.900]  Mark the Frog's out there in the fucking heat, sweating all day long, digging trenches and fucking doing welding shit.
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.800]  How many calories is an egg? Like 80? 90?
[22:34.100 --> 22:34.700]  Something like that?
[22:35.080 --> 22:36.580]  I can't be thinking about Mark the Frog while I'm eating.
[22:36.580 --> 22:37.360]  Yeah, you can.
[22:37.740 --> 22:39.640]  Mark the Frog fucked you up, dude.
[22:41.080 --> 22:42.240]  Let's see, let's see.
[22:42.340 --> 22:44.460]  6 hard-boiled eggs was his dinner, he says.
[22:44.540 --> 22:45.040]  Hell yeah.
[22:45.660 --> 22:46.120]  Hell yeah.
[22:47.660 --> 22:48.860]  That's good shit.
[22:49.180 --> 22:50.760]  Mark the Frog is cool hand Luke.
[22:54.060 --> 22:55.460]  Dude, egg salad rules.
[22:58.220 --> 22:59.440]  Egg salad is the shit.
[23:00.420 --> 23:01.040]  It's pretty decent.
[23:01.900 --> 23:03.380]  Nick feels really strongly about egg salad.
[23:03.400 --> 23:05.640]  I like an egg and cress sandwich.
[23:05.640 --> 23:07.360]  Oh, that's cool.
[23:07.380 --> 23:08.200]  Like water cress?
[23:08.960 --> 23:09.700]  No, it's just cress.
[23:09.860 --> 23:10.120]  Ew.
[23:10.340 --> 23:11.180]  What the fuck is cress?
[23:11.360 --> 23:12.660]  It's like dry cress.
[23:13.020 --> 23:16.040]  You know how you've got cress and then water cress?
[23:16.640 --> 23:20.320]  You started with the thing we're asking you about.
[23:20.660 --> 23:22.240]  You know how- it's cress.
[23:22.440 --> 23:23.320]  You know how there's cress?
[23:23.660 --> 23:25.200]  Looks like grass that you could eat.
[23:25.360 --> 23:25.920]  What do you want from me?
[23:26.120 --> 23:26.440]  It's cress.
[23:27.420 --> 23:27.940]  What?
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.040]  Stop saying cress.
[23:30.680 --> 23:32.840]  Goddamn cress, it's not water cress.
[23:33.160 --> 23:34.900]  Stop saying cress.
[23:34.900 --> 23:36.200]  The toothpaste?
[23:36.500 --> 23:39.580]  Grab a cress, chop it up, put it in some egg, put it in a salad.
[23:39.900 --> 23:41.460]  Is it just sprouts? Is he just talking about sprouts?
[23:41.760 --> 23:42.500]  Yeah, is it sprouts?
[23:43.020 --> 23:43.460]  Sprouts?
[23:44.720 --> 23:46.660]  I'm gonna fuck you up, Apple.
[23:46.880 --> 23:46.980]  Okay.
[23:47.560 --> 23:47.760]  No!
[23:48.700 --> 23:51.400]  GDef, 20 subs. GDef, let us know.
[23:51.540 --> 23:53.240]  And Johan Bach, let us know.
[23:53.320 --> 23:53.760]  Crazy.
[23:54.120 --> 23:55.480]  Let us know if-
[23:55.480 --> 23:56.320]  It's just fucking sprouts.
[23:56.720 --> 23:58.400]  Garden cress is just sprouts.
[23:59.860 --> 24:02.220]  Sprouts? You already got sprouts? That's Brussels sprouts.
[24:02.780 --> 24:03.960]  Not Brussels sprouts.
[24:03.960 --> 24:07.220]  No, no, you know how there's sprouts and you know how there's Brussels sprouts?
[24:07.840 --> 24:08.440]  They're not Brussels.
[24:08.600 --> 24:09.480]  That was really close, Geoff.
[24:12.240 --> 24:14.600]  Wasn't the one I was going for. I was going for Spungle Chuff.
[24:15.080 --> 24:18.260]  Why don't you chill out on Spungle Chuff?
[24:20.600 --> 24:24.020]  Dude, GDef is going wild in here with the 20 gifted. Crazy.
[24:24.340 --> 24:24.580]  Thank you.
[24:24.720 --> 24:27.600]  Can I do a backflip for Fricks? There we go.
[24:29.780 --> 24:30.180]  Dildo.
[24:31.880 --> 24:32.680]  Damn it!
[24:34.300 --> 24:35.940]  Dildo needs to be on your Worms team.
[24:36.900 --> 24:39.400]  But it's spelled with a Y so we get around it.
[24:39.820 --> 24:42.560]  Holly Molly Pocket, thank you for the 10 gifted. This is wild, man.
[24:43.020 --> 24:43.820]  Oh no, 2 health.
[24:44.140 --> 24:44.760]  Oh man.
[24:46.400 --> 24:48.400]  98 degrees is only 97 degrees now.
[24:49.760 --> 24:50.120]  Shit.
[24:50.240 --> 24:52.620]  I tried to open the inventory and I just shot Uzi again.
[24:57.120 --> 24:57.620]  Uh-oh.
[24:58.920 --> 25:00.280]  This music's oddly ominous.
[25:00.400 --> 25:03.160]  Why is it- Yo, it's just going straight up. It won't let me shoot it.
[25:04.060 --> 25:05.120]  Yeah, shoot it there.
[25:05.200 --> 25:06.220]  Straight into the roof.
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.460]  How have I never heard of Cressp?
[25:08.020 --> 25:09.280]  Dude, that's what I'm saying.
[25:10.060 --> 25:12.300]  Cress is like the first thing kids grow.
[25:14.500 --> 25:16.280]  I thought it would be hair.
[25:17.220 --> 25:17.800]  No!
[25:19.080 --> 25:20.400]  No, Superman!
[25:23.640 --> 25:24.220]  No!
[25:26.120 --> 25:28.960]  Turns out Superman was his own kryptonite.
[25:29.220 --> 25:29.540]  Yep.
[25:34.740 --> 25:37.960]  Yeah, you go to school, you learn about growing, you grow Cress.
[25:39.400 --> 25:40.620]  Stop saying Cress.
[25:41.340 --> 25:42.440]  Stop saying it.
[25:43.060 --> 25:44.260]  We gotta get some Cress in.
[25:44.960 --> 25:47.900]  If I make you an egg of Cress Savage, you'll bloody love it.
[25:48.060 --> 25:50.340]  Can we make a- Can we be Cress farmers?
[25:51.000 --> 25:51.740]  Oh, what a shot.
[25:52.300 --> 25:54.460]  Like, if we ever get an office, can we have like a-
[25:54.460 --> 25:55.400]  Cress rats in the chat. What's up, Cress rats?
[25:55.860 --> 25:57.240]  Let me do some micro farming.
[25:57.720 --> 25:59.420]  Dude, Jugs McTugs, 10 gifted.
[25:59.840 --> 26:00.880]  Thanks, Jugs McTugs.
[26:02.300 --> 26:04.540]  This stream is fucking crazy.
[26:04.960 --> 26:09.900]  Do you think there's somewhere out there on Twitch, there's a Tugs McJugs that's just waiting to meet their soulmate?
[26:10.120 --> 26:10.400]  Absolutely.
[26:10.680 --> 26:13.120]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, look.
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.360]  Raydexamine, yes, you grow Cress in an egg shell in cotton wool.
[26:18.540 --> 26:19.020]  Yeah, you do.
[26:24.420 --> 26:25.480]  Way to go, Apple.
[26:27.040 --> 26:27.700]  Oh, no.
[26:28.680 --> 26:29.360]  Uh-oh.
[26:29.540 --> 26:30.120]  Oh, no.
[26:34.620 --> 26:39.000]  Thank you, says Gavin, $15,000, but you have to change your name to Gronk Gibbles Benson.
[26:39.360 --> 26:42.040]  No, because then it sounds like I'm on your fucking worm stream.
[26:42.700 --> 26:44.780]  Hold on, I'm going to write down a nickname for next year.
[26:44.840 --> 26:45.580]  Gronk Gibbles Benson.
[26:45.740 --> 26:47.580]  I would do that for 15k, I would.
[26:49.680 --> 26:50.780]  What you doing, Geoff?
[26:51.580 --> 26:52.240]  Oh, no.
[26:53.920 --> 26:54.440]  Oh, no.
[26:54.700 --> 26:57.060]  I like the idea of calling Gavin Gibbles.
[26:58.040 --> 26:58.400]  Gibbles.
[27:01.040 --> 27:01.880]  Gibbles is funny.
[27:04.240 --> 27:04.840]  Yes.
[27:05.480 --> 27:07.380]  All right, it's the Gluckster.
[27:09.160 --> 27:11.520]  Let's see, what have we got?
[27:19.960 --> 27:20.840]  It is.
[27:22.520 --> 27:24.060]  What did you grow at school?
[27:25.580 --> 27:28.360]  Who let the rats out on a nine-day vacation?
[27:29.420 --> 27:31.640]  Who let the rats out?
[27:32.760 --> 27:37.060]  I would have read that as whole TT he ratsed out.
[27:37.460 --> 27:38.920]  I didn't understand that at all.
[27:41.600 --> 27:43.780]  We probably grew beans or some shit.
[27:44.940 --> 27:45.230]  Beans.
[27:45.800 --> 27:47.220]  A lot of people said lima beans.
[27:49.280 --> 27:50.100]  Spungle, no!
[27:50.380 --> 27:50.760]  Oh, my God.
[27:51.060 --> 27:52.920]  Oh, you take some heat, Spungle?
[27:53.580 --> 27:56.540]  Oh, I'm so hurt by that.
[27:57.820 --> 27:58.860]  What the fuck is...
[27:58.860 --> 27:59.940]  42.
[28:01.320 --> 28:02.190]  Oh, wow.
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.940]  What sudden death.
[28:05.320 --> 28:06.120]  Oh, my God.
[28:06.560 --> 28:07.780]  We're all down to one health.
[28:07.780 --> 28:09.800]  Oh, my Morgz is more gifted.
[28:09.980 --> 28:11.560]  How do we still have a hype train?
[28:11.660 --> 28:12.300]  It's level 15.
[28:12.440 --> 28:13.180]  This is insane.
[28:13.240 --> 28:14.100]  What's going on?
[28:14.280 --> 28:16.840]  Weird anniversary one here, boys.
[28:17.020 --> 28:17.800]  This is a crazy one.
[28:18.060 --> 28:19.400]  All the way through a Worms game.
[28:19.820 --> 28:20.000]  Yep.
[28:23.760 --> 28:24.200]  Okay.
[28:24.740 --> 28:25.560]  Oh, Spungle.
[28:28.400 --> 28:30.240]  Spungle in the jungle.
[28:30.700 --> 28:34.440]  Is Cress the thing that you grow for the chia pet?
[28:36.440 --> 28:36.960]  Chia seeds?
[28:37.640 --> 28:38.560]  Yeah, is that what Cress is?
[28:38.560 --> 28:38.820]  Chia.
[28:39.260 --> 28:39.700]  No.
[28:40.280 --> 28:40.540]  Oh.
[28:40.980 --> 28:42.140]  That's just chia.
[28:42.360 --> 28:43.020]  Ch-ch-ch-ch-chia.
[28:43.140 --> 28:43.780]  What are you doing?
[28:45.960 --> 28:49.620]  Give me a way that you could eat chia seeds after the chia pet.
[28:49.620 --> 28:50.120]  You can eat chia seeds?
[28:50.120 --> 28:51.880]  Yeah, you put it in your overnight oats.
[28:52.740 --> 28:53.740]  Oh, it goes so far!
[28:53.960 --> 28:54.400]  Wow!
[28:54.980 --> 28:55.460]  Uh-oh.
[28:56.100 --> 28:56.680]  Uh-oh.
[28:56.880 --> 28:57.440]  I miscompleted.
[28:57.440 --> 28:59.840]  Well, that was dedicated to that guy, Shmoo.
[29:00.200 --> 29:01.620]  And, Mictor, this one's for you.
[29:01.800 --> 29:03.700]  Holy shit, that was awesome.
[29:04.320 --> 29:06.220]  Dude, TLC is just down there, dude.
[29:06.240 --> 29:07.760]  Dude, that was...
[29:07.760 --> 29:08.520]  This is wild.
[29:08.520 --> 29:09.540]  That's why you don't chase waterfalls.
[29:12.020 --> 29:12.460]  Well...
[29:12.460 --> 29:13.180]  Uh-oh.
[29:13.460 --> 29:15.420]  Just walls of idiot flags that return.
[29:17.920 --> 29:20.400]  Oh, yeah, the idiot pendant's on sale this Sunday.
[29:20.880 --> 29:21.440]  Sure is.
[29:21.440 --> 29:21.980]  In central.
[29:22.540 --> 29:24.240]  Oh, that's a great teleport.
[29:25.040 --> 29:25.740]  Very tactical.
[29:25.900 --> 29:26.160]  Nice.
[29:26.360 --> 29:27.100]  TLC goes.
[29:27.640 --> 29:28.280]  Bye, TLC.
[29:28.960 --> 29:29.380]  Goodbye.
[29:31.340 --> 29:33.520]  Are we doing another round of this, or...
[29:33.520 --> 29:35.260]  We gotta do another round of this game. I'm in now.
[29:35.420 --> 29:36.200]  I'm loving this.
[29:36.720 --> 29:37.360]  Yeah, this is great.
[29:37.360 --> 29:39.780]  I don't know that I would say I'm loving it, but I'm into it.
[29:40.100 --> 29:42.920]  There's a scheme called Armageddon that I was gonna try next.
[29:43.080 --> 29:43.780]  Okay, let's do it.
[29:43.820 --> 29:44.540]  Oh, please.
[29:47.040 --> 29:47.400]  No.
[29:48.220 --> 29:48.420]  Yes.
[29:48.440 --> 29:48.800]  No.
[29:49.460 --> 29:49.820]  No.
[29:50.340 --> 29:50.520]  No.
[29:50.720 --> 29:51.080]  No.
[29:51.820 --> 29:52.060]  No.
[29:54.460 --> 29:55.580]  Only have to do one damage.
[29:55.660 --> 29:56.560]  Oh, you've done it.
[29:56.680 --> 29:57.580]  Only gotta do one.
[29:58.720 --> 29:59.080]  Nothing.
[29:59.660 --> 30:00.020]  Wow.
[30:00.080 --> 30:00.760]  Yeah, I got him.
[30:00.820 --> 30:01.840]  I can't...
[30:01.840 --> 30:02.200]  Oh, wow.
[30:03.260 --> 30:03.620]  Wow.
[30:04.940 --> 30:06.120]  Wow, that was huge.
[30:07.680 --> 30:09.140]  So now it's just you two, huh?
[30:09.700 --> 30:11.400]  1999 against Iconic Brands.
[30:11.640 --> 30:12.960]  Ratty Boy was the first one out.
[30:14.520 --> 30:15.400]  Bruzy says,
[30:15.460 --> 30:17.480]  Cress is a herb, sprouts are beans.
[30:17.740 --> 30:18.060]  Uh-huh.
[30:18.160 --> 30:18.480]  That's cool.
[30:20.100 --> 30:22.360]  I think Cress is made up, but...
[30:22.360 --> 30:23.040]  Bananas are yellow.
[30:23.840 --> 30:24.000]  Yep.
[30:24.760 --> 30:25.540]  Thank you, Geoff.
[30:25.840 --> 30:27.260]  Cosmic Cats, Prime Sub, hell yeah.
[30:29.820 --> 30:31.480]  Sounds like some British propaganda.
[30:32.460 --> 30:34.640]  Okay, watch Andrew fall apart. Hang on.
[30:36.480 --> 30:38.780]  Okay, hang on, he's falling apart. Give it a second.
[30:39.040 --> 30:39.680]  How do I spin it?
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.020]  Hang on, here he goes.
[30:41.260 --> 30:41.660]  How do I...
[30:41.660 --> 30:42.220]  Falling apart.
[30:42.360 --> 30:43.040]  How do I...
[30:43.040 --> 30:43.280]  Stick.
[30:43.880 --> 30:44.940]  There you go, 15 seconds.
[30:45.160 --> 30:47.040]  And you can make it bigger if you rotate all the way around.
[30:50.500 --> 30:51.220]  10 seconds.
[30:51.400 --> 30:52.480]  You're putting it in the floor.
[30:53.360 --> 30:53.900]  Falling apart.
[30:54.280 --> 30:57.620]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[30:57.620 --> 30:58.600]  Not gonna do it in time.
[30:59.160 --> 30:59.920]  Not gonna do it in time.
[31:00.440 --> 31:02.620]  And oh my Morgz, that's dedicated to you.
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.520]  Why'd you do that at the last minute?
[31:04.520 --> 31:08.580]  Because I was listening to Nick's count, which was slower than the real count.
[31:08.580 --> 31:10.360]  And I thought I had more time than I did.
[31:11.800 --> 31:13.800]  Oh Geoff, go get that. Geoff, go get it.
[31:14.940 --> 31:18.080]  Why would you not go get all the cool shit? There's cool shit in there.
[31:21.160 --> 31:22.600]  Is it gonna fall to his death?
[31:22.740 --> 31:24.380]  No. No, it wasn't high enough, not even.
[31:24.820 --> 31:25.280]  What was it?
[31:25.420 --> 31:26.140]  Gavin was counting on that.
[31:26.160 --> 31:27.600]  Did you get cool shit?
[31:28.340 --> 31:28.940]  I'll show you.
[31:30.780 --> 31:31.500]  Oh no.
[31:31.800 --> 31:32.740]  Like a stink bomb.
[31:33.220 --> 31:33.800]  Oh no.
[31:35.060 --> 31:35.700]  Homing pigeon.
[31:36.460 --> 31:36.820]  Nice.
[31:39.600 --> 31:40.800]  That was awesome.
[31:43.360 --> 31:47.620]  Hey, Xorabeam says, I can't get anniversary merch. I can't even subscribe on Twitch. I'm a patron though.
[31:47.700 --> 31:48.700]  Hey, thank you.
[31:49.020 --> 31:49.940]  That means a lot.
[31:50.300 --> 31:51.800]  Just watching our videos means a lot too.
[31:51.940 --> 31:53.080]  So thank you to everyone who does that.
[31:53.400 --> 31:54.820]  Even if you're just watching this stuff for free.
[31:54.960 --> 31:55.720]  Thank you. Appreciate it.
[31:55.740 --> 31:58.260]  The most important thing is the use of your eyeballs and your ears.
[31:58.460 --> 31:59.160]  Yes, absolutely.
[31:59.680 --> 32:01.520]  Alright boys, let's do Armageddon.
[32:01.520 --> 32:01.840]  Armageddon.
[32:04.440 --> 32:05.480]  We're Armageddon it.
[32:05.900 --> 32:06.260]  Right, Geoff?
[32:06.620 --> 32:07.020]  Armageddon.
[32:07.020 --> 32:08.400]  Yeah, are you getting it?
[32:08.540 --> 32:09.460]  Yes, Armageddon it.
[32:10.660 --> 32:11.100]  Armageddon it!
[32:11.180 --> 32:12.080]  That's what I'm talking about.
[32:13.140 --> 32:14.280]  You guys like fruit?
[32:15.320 --> 32:15.740]  Yeah.
[32:16.120 --> 32:17.100]  Yeah, well how about them apples?
[32:17.400 --> 32:18.300]  You know I like fruit.
[32:18.520 --> 32:19.240]  Ready up.
[32:19.980 --> 32:20.740]  I already have.
[32:21.000 --> 32:21.980]  How do you like them bananas?
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.340]  Okay, readied up.
[32:23.380 --> 32:23.960]  Let's do it, boys.
[32:24.480 --> 32:24.920]  Whoa!
[32:25.780 --> 32:26.620]  What the fuck?
[32:26.780 --> 32:29.580]  Oh, Armageddon is like you place your arms first.
[32:30.080 --> 32:30.740]  Wow.
[32:31.100 --> 32:32.200]  Oh, man.
[32:32.460 --> 32:33.240]  Backstreet Boys.
[32:33.720 --> 32:34.040]  Okay.
[32:34.780 --> 32:35.120]  Wait, what?
[32:35.240 --> 32:36.900]  Are those just floating in space?
[32:37.060 --> 32:37.220]  Yep.
[32:37.820 --> 32:39.060]  Now it's Um's turn.
[32:39.380 --> 32:39.640]  Yep.
[32:39.780 --> 32:41.940]  Let's see if he decides to place his worms.
[32:46.000 --> 32:46.960]  Reg's turn.
[32:48.320 --> 32:50.940]  Where do I want to...
[32:50.940 --> 32:51.420]  Gavin, is this you?
[32:51.420 --> 32:52.620]  Don't worry, Nick will count down for you.
[32:52.940 --> 32:54.240]  No, it is me.
[32:55.040 --> 32:55.800]  Oh, shit.
[32:56.460 --> 32:57.860]  I'm so stupid.
[32:58.340 --> 32:58.480]  Yeah.
[32:59.640 --> 33:00.040]  Yeah.
[33:00.280 --> 33:00.940]  Must be all the Cress.
[33:04.280 --> 33:06.080]  Doogee, thanks for five gifted subs.
[33:06.280 --> 33:06.860]  Thank you.
[33:08.960 --> 33:10.780]  Oh, you're putting him in there with Backstreet Boys?
[33:11.260 --> 33:11.660]  Absolutely.
[33:12.500 --> 33:13.020]  Oh, my God.
[33:13.580 --> 33:14.640]  One place to put it.
[33:17.060 --> 33:18.320]  Doogee coming through big style.
[33:18.400 --> 33:18.880]  I love it.
[33:19.120 --> 33:22.580]  I would laugh so fucking hard as soon as you drop and he just falls straight down.
[33:22.580 --> 33:24.460]  I don't know if that hole is real or just a...
[33:24.460 --> 33:24.760]  It's just a picture.
[33:25.100 --> 33:25.760]  It's just a picture.
[33:26.360 --> 33:26.720]  Go up!
[33:26.720 --> 33:27.980]  You're an idiot.
[33:28.920 --> 33:29.960]  You're so dumb.
[33:31.120 --> 33:32.780]  Can I get in that hole?
[33:33.840 --> 33:34.480]  You don't.
[33:35.060 --> 33:36.160]  But I want to get in the hole.
[33:37.940 --> 33:39.480]  You didn't dig into the hole, huh?
[33:39.540 --> 33:40.240]  Oh, my God.
[33:41.580 --> 33:42.540]  Put me in the hole.
[33:43.200 --> 33:43.920]  Alright, Um's turn.
[33:44.660 --> 33:45.400]  Yeah, Um's thinking.
[33:45.560 --> 33:46.740]  Put me in the picture of a hole.
[33:49.100 --> 33:49.500]  Gavin!
[33:50.340 --> 33:51.080]  It's me, right?
[33:51.280 --> 33:51.480]  Okay.
[33:54.020 --> 33:54.840]  Can I go up here?
[33:54.840 --> 33:55.460]  Yeah.
[33:56.940 --> 33:57.980]  Yeah, put him right there.
[33:58.120 --> 33:59.020]  That's it, right there.
[33:59.260 --> 33:59.960]  Good spot.
[34:04.420 --> 34:04.840]  Handicap.
[34:05.160 --> 34:06.040]  Starting 16 down.
[34:06.140 --> 34:06.440]  Way to go.
[34:09.660 --> 34:10.760]  Now you put him there, Eric.
[34:14.270 --> 34:16.670]  Eric's just like the unwanted roommate in all these holes.
[34:17.050 --> 34:18.190]  I'm just hanging out with...
[34:18.190 --> 34:19.550]  Me and my friends having fun.
[34:20.050 --> 34:21.410]  I love hanging out with my friends.
[34:22.010 --> 34:22.410]  It's a picture.
[34:23.210 --> 34:24.590]  Clayton got Satan's...
[34:24.590 --> 34:25.890]  Andrew, for God's sake.
[34:26.150 --> 34:27.810]  Bacon wrapped dates rule.
[34:28.810 --> 34:29.890]  It's a picture of a hole.
[34:30.250 --> 34:31.050]  Bacon wrapped dates?
[34:31.310 --> 34:32.690]  Have you ever had a bacon wrapped date?
[34:32.750 --> 34:34.670]  I don't think I've ever had that before, but it sounds really yummy.
[34:34.770 --> 34:38.290]  Yeah, I went to a wedding about a week ago where they had them.
[34:38.870 --> 34:39.290]  Oh, really?
[34:40.130 --> 34:40.450]  Yeah.
[34:40.950 --> 34:42.830]  I don't think I... were they on hors d'oeuvres or something?
[34:43.130 --> 34:43.450]  Yeah.
[34:43.890 --> 34:45.030]  I always ignore the hors d'oeuvres.
[34:45.530 --> 34:46.350]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:46.350 --> 34:47.070]  I don't want to eat.
[34:47.350 --> 34:47.550]  I would hate to eat.
[34:47.550 --> 34:51.670]  No, I want to eat, but there's 98% chance there's going to be something white on it.
[34:51.990 --> 34:52.310]  Oh.
[34:52.830 --> 34:53.410]  Or fish.
[34:54.410 --> 34:56.050]  Would you like fish in white sauce?
[34:56.190 --> 34:56.930]  No, I...
[34:56.930 --> 34:57.230]  Yeah!
[34:58.570 --> 35:02.170]  I like... I like filling up this one, like, the one, like, little beam. That's fun.
[35:03.190 --> 35:06.870]  Would you like a tiny little finger food sandwich that's 80% mayonnaise?
[35:07.250 --> 35:07.450]  No.
[35:12.340 --> 35:13.160]  Just hanging out.
[35:13.220 --> 35:13.980]  What the...
[35:13.980 --> 35:16.160]  That was, uh, that was the first wedding I wasn't in.
[35:17.260 --> 35:17.880]  Oh, nice.
[35:18.100 --> 35:18.520]  Loved it.
[35:18.740 --> 35:19.620]  Losing your touch.
[35:20.780 --> 35:22.180]  Dude, look at ratty boy.
[35:22.600 --> 35:23.120]  He's fucked.
[35:23.120 --> 35:23.400]  Hanging out.
[35:23.960 --> 35:24.800]  He's the first to die.
[35:24.800 --> 35:25.860]  He's hard fucked.
[35:26.220 --> 35:26.700]  Nah, ratty boy's great.
[35:26.700 --> 35:28.280]  He's one homing pigeon away from a wash.
[35:28.780 --> 35:33.080]  So, uh, listen to it when I have to place my worm again.
[35:33.220 --> 35:34.980]  There's, like, the different voice lines or whatever.
[35:35.140 --> 35:37.120]  One of them is just called, like, sexy babe.
[35:37.300 --> 35:37.320]  Oh, shit.
[35:37.320 --> 35:39.380]  Because it's, like, a 1999 game.
[35:39.900 --> 35:41.140]  And it is awesome.
[35:41.760 --> 35:42.320]  Nice babe.
[35:44.100 --> 35:44.540]  It's...
[35:44.540 --> 35:46.220]  So, there's regulation team.
[35:46.460 --> 35:47.780]  It's saying the yes, sir.
[35:49.400 --> 35:50.280]  Oh, is this my last one?
[35:50.820 --> 35:51.080]  Mm-hmm.
[35:51.080 --> 35:51.640]  Oh, no.
[36:00.720 --> 36:02.320]  That sounds like a real hot babe.
[36:02.700 --> 36:03.420]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[36:03.840 --> 36:04.220]  Yes, sir.
[36:04.920 --> 36:05.600]  Real hot babe.
[36:06.140 --> 36:07.600]  Oh, I'm already looking at the inventory.
[36:07.740 --> 36:08.560]  There's a lot more stuff.
[36:08.640 --> 36:09.420]  Get the fuck...
[36:09.420 --> 36:10.240]  Oh, my God.
[36:10.840 --> 36:11.280]  You seeing that?
[36:11.300 --> 36:11.900]  There's a lot more.
[36:12.160 --> 36:12.960]  Apple's on the move.
[36:13.060 --> 36:13.760]  It's a skunk.
[36:13.980 --> 36:14.180]  What's this?
[36:14.860 --> 36:15.660]  It's, like, a...
[36:15.660 --> 36:15.940]  Whoa!
[36:16.860 --> 36:17.520]  Uh-oh!
[36:17.560 --> 36:18.940]  What the...
[36:18.940 --> 36:19.560]  What is this?
[36:19.560 --> 36:20.520]  What is happening?
[36:21.020 --> 36:22.360]  What is going on?
[36:22.360 --> 36:23.100]  It's...
[36:23.100 --> 36:23.800]  Oh, we're all sick.
[36:23.980 --> 36:25.060]  We're all dying every time.
[36:25.220 --> 36:25.240]  Why?
[36:25.280 --> 36:27.220]  Holy shit, we got illness.
[36:28.680 --> 36:30.180]  98 Degrees is ill?
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.240]  It's mushroom spores.
[36:33.200 --> 36:34.400]  Whose turn is it?
[36:34.940 --> 36:35.540]  No one.
[36:35.720 --> 36:36.780]  Now it's everyone's.
[36:37.140 --> 36:37.800]  Oh, no.
[36:37.960 --> 36:38.580]  This is disaster.
[36:38.800 --> 36:39.280]  This is insane.
[36:39.620 --> 36:39.980]  1995.
[36:42.360 --> 36:42.880]  Hey.
[36:44.600 --> 36:45.980]  They won't shut up.
[36:50.500 --> 36:52.340]  Why don't you go one over?
[36:52.360 --> 36:53.820]  Oh, no!
[36:56.500 --> 36:59.020]  That's a weird little bubble to be in.
[36:59.200 --> 36:59.400]  Yep.
[36:59.880 --> 37:01.060]  You're stuck in here with us.
[37:01.180 --> 37:01.580]  I know.
[37:02.780 --> 37:04.240]  I just realized that now.
[37:04.520 --> 37:05.600]  Uh-oh.
[37:06.020 --> 37:06.840]  Oh, my God.
[37:07.100 --> 37:07.660]  Oh, God.
[37:07.900 --> 37:08.440]  This is...
[37:08.440 --> 37:09.540]  Insane.
[37:09.720 --> 37:11.120]  This is gonna be over real fast.
[37:11.400 --> 37:11.560]  Yep.
[37:15.460 --> 37:17.340]  The noise sucks.
[37:17.340 --> 37:19.280]  It's so shitty.
[37:23.920 --> 37:25.520]  A lot of sniffles going on.
[37:26.380 --> 37:27.520]  What are you gonna do, though?
[37:28.020 --> 37:28.920]  I don't know.
[37:30.800 --> 37:31.860]  I know what I'm gonna do.
[37:31.860 --> 37:32.360]  Oh, my God.
[37:32.400 --> 37:33.300]  This is crazy.
[37:33.680 --> 37:34.580]  Oh, my God.
[37:37.140 --> 37:37.580]  Wow.
[37:37.900 --> 37:40.060]  Of all of the new weapons, you did a bazooka.
[37:40.340 --> 37:40.600]  Yep.
[37:41.920 --> 37:42.800]  I panicked.
[37:45.500 --> 37:46.640]  What is this?
[37:47.460 --> 37:48.080]  Regulation team.
[37:48.420 --> 37:48.520]  Oh, it's the fun.
[37:49.340 --> 37:50.560]  Wait for my turn.
[37:51.500 --> 37:52.940]  Okay, I'm gonna do...
[37:52.940 --> 37:53.680]  What have we got here?
[37:53.840 --> 37:54.500]  What is this?
[37:55.660 --> 37:57.020]  Oh, a flamethrower.
[37:57.300 --> 37:58.260]  Holy shit.
[37:58.740 --> 37:59.880]  What is that?
[38:00.060 --> 38:00.960]  Oh, a mole.
[38:01.560 --> 38:01.960]  Hell yeah.
[38:02.060 --> 38:02.420]  What's that do?
[38:02.460 --> 38:02.620]  What's a mole?
[38:03.160 --> 38:03.860]  Do you think it digs?
[38:03.980 --> 38:06.360]  You're gonna unleash a mole on a sick ballerina?
[38:06.800 --> 38:07.680]  What the fuck?
[38:07.780 --> 38:08.640]  Check this out.
[38:08.880 --> 38:09.100]  Okay.
[38:09.460 --> 38:10.260]  Oh, what?
[38:10.300 --> 38:11.060]  I'm sure this will go well.
[38:13.400 --> 38:15.040]  Did you dig it?
[38:16.660 --> 38:18.340]  Did you not dig it?
[38:20.060 --> 38:21.280]  I mean, dug.
[38:22.100 --> 38:22.580]  What?
[38:29.950 --> 38:31.870]  This constant achoo.
[38:33.650 --> 38:34.410]  Oh, shit.
[38:34.690 --> 38:36.310]  Content Melon just got laid off today.
[38:36.410 --> 38:36.710]  I'm sorry.
[38:37.450 --> 38:38.670]  Sorry, Content Melon.
[38:39.610 --> 38:40.190]  It's awful.
[38:41.050 --> 38:41.970]  Fuck that job, though.
[38:42.670 --> 38:43.230]  Yeah, seriously.
[38:43.350 --> 38:43.810]  What happened?
[38:44.210 --> 38:44.750]  What happened?
[38:45.710 --> 38:46.410]  What'd you do?
[38:46.530 --> 38:46.790]  Did you give him a back rub?
[38:46.790 --> 38:48.170]  I hit the button and it just...
[38:48.170 --> 38:51.110]  I sneezed and it just hurt me a little bit.
[38:51.110 --> 38:52.630]  Gave him a little back rub.
[38:52.830 --> 38:54.050]  What the fuck was that?
[38:54.770 --> 38:56.150]  A little rub on the tongue.
[38:57.130 --> 38:58.490]  Maybe it's like a long plan.
[38:58.630 --> 38:59.650]  Does it damage over time?
[38:59.870 --> 39:00.550]  I don't think so.
[39:00.830 --> 39:02.830]  Maybe every time you sneeze it hurts you more.
[39:04.210 --> 39:06.190]  Just sneeze in his open mouth.
[39:08.130 --> 39:08.890]  Oh, bow it out.
[39:09.390 --> 39:11.650]  Why would you test it on Sponglechuff's forehead?
[39:12.390 --> 39:13.270]  Test it wherever.
[39:13.550 --> 39:14.390]  Send it right through his brain.
[39:15.630 --> 39:15.810]  Yeah.
[39:16.210 --> 39:16.750]  There you go.
[39:17.310 --> 39:17.850]  Full power.
[39:18.450 --> 39:19.150]  Don't hit the wrong button.
[39:19.810 --> 39:20.550]  Don't hit the wrong button.
[39:20.550 --> 39:20.770]  Andrew!
[39:21.430 --> 39:22.490]  You hit the wrong button.
[39:23.230 --> 39:24.030]  Eight seconds.
[39:24.550 --> 39:24.970]  You hit the wrong button.
[39:24.970 --> 39:25.690]  Five seconds.
[39:26.050 --> 39:26.690]  How do I fire?
[39:26.810 --> 39:27.450]  How do I fire?
[39:27.630 --> 39:28.230]  How do I fire?
[39:28.510 --> 39:28.930]  Oh, B!
[39:29.650 --> 39:29.970]  Andrew!
[39:29.990 --> 39:30.770]  You hit the wrong button.
[39:33.030 --> 39:33.710]  Every turn.
[39:34.910 --> 39:35.670]  Was it B?
[39:35.930 --> 39:36.110]  A?
[39:36.250 --> 39:38.610]  I thought it was A. I was mashing A and nothing was happening.
[39:39.050 --> 39:39.690]  We just played a whole game.
[39:39.750 --> 39:42.790]  So I think maybe it wasn't A then.
[39:43.710 --> 39:45.370]  That's why I started hitting other buttons.
[39:45.530 --> 39:46.710]  That's why Nike's over there.
[39:47.070 --> 39:49.730]  I kept pressing the wrong button and it didn't work, Gavin.
[39:49.730 --> 39:51.710]  So I pressed all the other wrong buttons.
[39:53.290 --> 39:55.070]  Eventually one of them has to be right.
[39:55.790 --> 39:57.070]  Oh, sheep in the AM.
[39:57.190 --> 39:58.150]  This is a real early sheep.
[39:58.270 --> 40:00.010]  No! No! Jump! Keep jumping! Keep jumping!
[40:00.110 --> 40:00.450]  No!
[40:04.490 --> 40:05.560]  How the fuck?
[40:06.830 --> 40:07.950]  Right on you!
[40:08.610 --> 40:09.570]  Oh, man.
[40:12.430 --> 40:13.790]  Son of a bitch.
[40:14.370 --> 40:16.190]  Idiot flags in the chat.
[40:17.990 --> 40:19.130]  Let's see here.
[40:20.390 --> 40:24.730]  I think we should somehow make it so that idiot flags are visible on the video for the VOD.
[40:26.750 --> 40:27.170]  Whoa!
[40:27.610 --> 40:28.030]  What?
[40:29.450 --> 40:30.810]  Crazy sheep style.
[40:30.870 --> 40:31.650]  Oh, no! Oh, no!
[40:31.650 --> 40:31.950]  Oh, no!
[40:32.030 --> 40:32.430]  Oh, no!
[40:33.550 --> 40:33.970]  No!
[40:39.090 --> 40:41.370]  The sheep were destined for that spot.
[40:41.470 --> 40:42.590]  Was that a super sheep or a sheep?
[40:42.590 --> 40:42.650]  Goddamn.
[40:43.050 --> 40:43.710]  Oh, man.
[40:43.730 --> 40:45.430]  That was a rocket sheep.
[40:45.890 --> 40:46.750]  Yeah, sheep launcher.
[40:47.310 --> 40:48.570]  Oh, I didn't really launch very far.
[40:51.310 --> 40:52.810]  All right, Binti Spuds.
[40:53.090 --> 40:54.450]  All right, Binti Spuds, what you got?
[40:54.690 --> 40:55.290]  Oh, ratty boy.
[40:56.110 --> 40:57.190]  You do ratty boys drown.
[40:57.390 --> 40:59.690]  I'm so glad he and Apple are just down there like idiots.
[41:00.530 --> 41:01.150]  Ratty boy.
[41:04.450 --> 41:05.410]  Oh, what is that?
[41:05.430 --> 41:05.790]  Oh, shit!
[41:06.070 --> 41:06.310]  Come on.
[41:06.450 --> 41:07.310]  Is that a skunk?
[41:08.010 --> 41:08.770]  Skunk, baby.
[41:10.170 --> 41:12.170]  I think it would just make them sick, though, wouldn't it?
[41:12.530 --> 41:13.510]  I don't know. We're going to find out.
[41:13.690 --> 41:14.710]  We're already sick, so whatever.
[41:14.910 --> 41:15.430]  Long skunk!
[41:16.610 --> 41:17.330]  Long skunk!
[41:18.450 --> 41:19.310]  Where the hell is it?
[41:19.590 --> 41:20.010]  He didn't throw it.
[41:20.790 --> 41:21.230]  Oh!
[41:21.590 --> 41:23.470]  Oh, my God.
[41:24.050 --> 41:26.050]  What an interesting fake out that was.
[41:26.170 --> 41:26.370]  Yeah.
[41:27.350 --> 41:30.650]  Well, I was worried that it would just make them sick, but I realized all the worms were sick.
[41:30.970 --> 41:31.170]  Yeah.
[41:33.310 --> 41:33.750]  Ratty!
[41:35.170 --> 41:36.730]  Realized all the worms were sick.
[41:36.850 --> 41:38.910]  Our immune systems are compromised.
[41:39.130 --> 41:40.490]  What a better time to strike than now.
[41:42.870 --> 41:43.310]  Ooh.
[41:45.010 --> 41:45.910]  Think that'll hit?
[41:46.050 --> 41:46.490]  Let's see.
[41:47.350 --> 41:49.250]  Let's see what a battle axe does, huh?
[41:49.250 --> 41:50.370]  What is prod?
[41:50.510 --> 41:51.350]  In the top of my head?
[41:51.930 --> 41:52.830]  Oh, my God.
[41:52.970 --> 41:53.310]  Whoa.
[41:54.110 --> 41:54.550]  Oh!
[41:55.410 --> 41:56.950]  It looked like I went through the floor.
[41:57.370 --> 41:58.070]  I thought you died.
[41:58.390 --> 41:58.990]  Did it hurt him?
[41:59.890 --> 42:02.310]  Captain Burble has a Ratty Boy t-shirt.
[42:02.430 --> 42:03.470]  That's a fucking collector's item.
[42:03.610 --> 42:03.710]  What?
[42:03.830 --> 42:04.790]  That's a collector's item.
[42:06.250 --> 42:07.390]  Oh, there's a...
[42:07.390 --> 42:07.750]  Ratty!
[42:09.230 --> 42:10.330]  Oh, Ratty Boy.
[42:10.710 --> 42:12.290]  Ratty Boy's about to drown, thank God.
[42:14.010 --> 42:17.390]  Do you like seeing Ratty Boy so ill and on the brink of death?
[42:17.690 --> 42:18.070]  Yes.
[42:20.130 --> 42:21.050]  Next question.
[42:21.590 --> 42:22.550]  Next question.
[42:24.370 --> 42:24.870]  Correct.
[42:30.090 --> 42:31.210]  What's the move here?
[42:31.450 --> 42:31.730]  Binny Gun?
[42:32.570 --> 42:33.070]  Too low.
[42:33.690 --> 42:38.390]  Wasn't the day that we announced Ratty Boy the day that we announced that Rooster Teeth was closing?
[42:38.710 --> 42:39.190]  Yes.
[42:39.570 --> 42:41.390]  The day that we announced that we acquired Ratty Boy.
[42:42.250 --> 42:44.850]  We had that video and audio come out labeled an announcement at the same time.
[42:44.850 --> 42:48.310]  It was like a special announcement, and then it was like another special announcement.
[42:48.310 --> 42:50.390]  It was 30 minutes later.
[42:50.830 --> 42:51.270]  Yeah.
[42:51.370 --> 42:53.370]  The company closing announcement came out.
[42:53.550 --> 42:54.930]  Causing a lot of confusion.
[42:55.070 --> 42:59.890]  In our Ratty Boy announcement, there was art made of Ratty Boy driving Artie out of Texas.
[43:00.590 --> 43:00.790]  Yep.
[43:01.670 --> 43:02.330]  It's pretty good.
[43:02.390 --> 43:02.830]  Out of Austin.
[43:03.110 --> 43:03.550]  Yeah.
[43:03.970 --> 43:05.090]  Dude, this is awesome.
[43:05.270 --> 43:05.990]  Oh my God.
[43:07.470 --> 43:09.170]  Well, we're all going to drown in that hole.
[43:10.010 --> 43:10.270]  No.
[43:10.530 --> 43:11.490]  Let's see what this is all about.
[43:11.750 --> 43:11.930]  Hey.
[43:12.190 --> 43:12.530]  Oh, hey.
[43:12.530 --> 43:12.890]  That's shit.
[43:13.070 --> 43:13.670]  It's gonna be good.
[43:14.030 --> 43:14.150]  No!
[43:16.090 --> 43:17.550]  There's a mine on my head!
[43:19.970 --> 43:23.430]  If any of these worms die, it's going to be a chain reaction from hell.
[43:25.690 --> 43:26.650]  Holy shit.
[43:27.630 --> 43:28.050]  Apple!
[43:28.590 --> 43:29.150]  They'll all die.
[43:29.590 --> 43:30.510]  They'll all die.
[43:32.190 --> 43:33.150]  Uh-oh.
[43:33.290 --> 43:34.170]  Oh no.
[43:34.590 --> 43:35.150]  Oh no.
[43:35.590 --> 43:36.770]  What will we do, my friend?
[43:38.330 --> 43:39.730]  Oh, there's only one thing to do.
[43:39.730 --> 43:41.450]  Mark the Frog says, what is a Ratty Boy?
[43:41.570 --> 43:42.770]  Don't worry about it, Mark.
[43:43.310 --> 43:43.810]  You'll find out.
[43:43.970 --> 43:45.830]  Don't worry about Ratty Boy.
[43:45.910 --> 43:46.890]  You'll find out.
[43:47.550 --> 43:48.770]  It's an ominous threat.
[43:49.530 --> 43:51.210]  Mark the Frog, Ratty the Boy, whatever.
[43:52.490 --> 43:53.010]  No.
[43:53.390 --> 43:54.110]  Bum's last act.
[43:55.930 --> 43:57.250]  Bum's last act.
[43:57.310 --> 43:58.670]  Not Penny's boat!
[44:01.630 --> 44:04.350]  No matter what I do to you, you're gonna die, Charlie.
[44:06.330 --> 44:07.290]  Oh shit.
[44:07.810 --> 44:08.210]  Oh!
[44:08.890 --> 44:10.110]  Oh my God.
[44:10.530 --> 44:11.250]  I don't think it matters.
[44:11.410 --> 44:12.870]  We're all so low, we're all going to drown.
[44:14.270 --> 44:15.650]  Nah, you won't make it that far.
[44:16.550 --> 44:17.070]  Ballerina!
[44:17.070 --> 44:17.590]  Oh!
[44:18.870 --> 44:19.630]  Bring her back.
[44:20.110 --> 44:21.450]  I think I have one worm.
[44:21.750 --> 44:22.750]  Gluck and fun.
[44:24.150 --> 44:24.310]  Oh!
[44:28.330 --> 44:30.190]  What a bungle!
[44:32.830 --> 44:33.830]  Oh no!
[44:38.070 --> 44:40.070]  The little plop sound is so good.
[44:41.550 --> 44:43.490]  I'm about to drown with Backstreet Boys.
[44:43.770 --> 44:44.450]  Bungle chuff.
[44:44.950 --> 44:45.430]  Let's hold hands.
[44:47.590 --> 44:48.270]  Right.
[44:48.670 --> 44:49.270]  Right then.
[44:49.270 --> 44:50.510]  Let's do this.
[44:50.550 --> 44:51.990]  Oh, you made it!
[44:52.170 --> 44:52.570]  Wow!
[44:54.050 --> 44:56.310]  Looks like you could've made it.
[44:58.530 --> 45:00.750]  Oh, sent it straight through the brain.
[45:01.470 --> 45:02.250]  And then to hell.
[45:02.490 --> 45:03.330]  How did you do that?
[45:03.430 --> 45:08.150]  How come you didn't do a backflip, a frontflip, another backflip, and then land in the wrong spot?
[45:08.570 --> 45:08.690]  That's crazy.
[45:08.790 --> 45:09.770]  Multiple arrows.
[45:12.330 --> 45:13.190]  Taking cover.
[45:14.210 --> 45:15.230]  Protect me, stem.
[45:16.550 --> 45:17.770]  Oh, double plop.
[45:18.410 --> 45:19.250]  Goodbye, friends.
[45:19.610 --> 45:20.530]  Oh, there we go.
[45:21.750 --> 45:22.550]  What's next?
[45:23.490 --> 45:26.210]  Andrew, are you glad you didn't put a worm in the picture of an apple hole?
[45:28.930 --> 45:30.710]  It would've been pretty cool, though.
[45:31.810 --> 45:32.410]  Oh shit.
[45:33.110 --> 45:33.790]  Good bat.
[45:34.110 --> 45:35.530]  I like the melee items.
[45:36.710 --> 45:37.930]  Yeah, they're pretty beefy in this game.
[45:38.170 --> 45:38.750]  Yeah, they're awesome.
[45:38.790 --> 45:41.190]  And I think you can skim worms on the water if you hit them with the right arrow.
[45:41.190 --> 45:41.510]  Oh, cool.
[45:41.890 --> 45:43.130]  I think Dumb's about to drown.
[45:43.510 --> 45:43.850]  Goodbye.
[45:47.770 --> 45:49.410]  Nick is down to gum only.
[45:49.830 --> 45:50.110]  It's tough.
[45:50.770 --> 45:51.850]  He's gumming it.
[45:53.430 --> 45:56.190]  I'm counting down the turns until the super sheep unlocks.
[45:57.750 --> 45:58.950]  You too, huh?
[46:00.090 --> 46:01.050]  What are you doing?
[46:02.230 --> 46:03.230]  What are you doing?
[46:04.850 --> 46:05.930]  Oh shit.
[46:06.550 --> 46:07.070]  Oh shit.
[46:07.390 --> 46:07.610]  Oh shit.
[46:07.610 --> 46:08.090]  Oh my god.
[46:08.530 --> 46:08.750]  Oh shit.
[46:09.790 --> 46:09.870]  Wow.
[46:10.150 --> 46:11.790]  Oh, TLC might be toast now.
[46:12.290 --> 46:13.190]  Oh no.
[46:14.330 --> 46:15.590]  No, I killed Disney.
[46:15.590 --> 46:16.430]  No.
[46:21.750 --> 46:24.150]  That was for Binti Spuds.
[46:25.850 --> 46:27.030]  For what Spuds?
[46:27.730 --> 46:28.310]  Binti.
[46:35.830 --> 46:36.990]  Binti Spuds.
[46:38.990 --> 46:40.730]  Pay no notice to Binti Spuds.
[46:42.230 --> 46:44.450]  Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.
[46:44.510 --> 46:46.090]  You can jump, you know.
[46:46.570 --> 46:47.430]  Oh, can I?
[46:47.730 --> 46:49.390]  Yeah, give it.
[46:49.690 --> 46:51.710]  Yeah, a year of this shit.
[46:51.850 --> 46:53.730]  One more year, we can do another year of this.
[46:53.810 --> 46:54.410]  Hell yeah, get him.
[46:54.830 --> 46:55.030]  Get him, get him.
[46:55.570 --> 46:56.730]  Get him, fucking Cress.
[46:56.830 --> 46:57.570]  Get him, Watercress.
[46:57.770 --> 46:58.150]  There you go.
[46:58.890 --> 47:00.350]  Oh, this is cold Cress.
[47:00.430 --> 47:01.250]  It's no Cress.
[47:01.370 --> 47:01.910]  Get out of here.
[47:02.730 --> 47:03.210]  Oh no.
[47:03.210 --> 47:04.250]  Oh shit.
[47:04.610 --> 47:05.590]  Spud's ass bitch.
[47:07.990 --> 47:09.110]  That's Spud's ass.
[47:10.010 --> 47:11.130]  Oh, he lived.
[47:11.910 --> 47:12.450]  Oh, he drowned.
[47:12.770 --> 47:13.610]  Oh no, he's...
[47:13.610 --> 47:14.390]  Oh, he's alive.
[47:14.870 --> 47:15.190]  Wow.
[47:15.450 --> 47:15.990]  There's a hole there though.
[47:15.990 --> 47:17.150]  There's a hole right next to him.
[47:17.150 --> 47:18.210]  He can't even see his head.
[47:18.670 --> 47:19.410]  Alright, gum time.
[47:19.910 --> 47:21.030]  Oh my god.
[47:21.530 --> 47:22.890]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:22.930 --> 47:23.790]  That's a problem.
[47:24.250 --> 47:25.650]  Homing Missile Sponge Chomp.
[47:26.010 --> 47:26.530]  Spongelchuff.
[47:26.950 --> 47:28.730]  Homing Missile Spongelchuff.
[47:28.910 --> 47:30.050]  What's a homing missile?
[47:30.190 --> 47:30.370]  Where is it?
[47:30.370 --> 47:31.010]  I don't know.
[47:31.390 --> 47:32.530]  There's gotta be something.
[47:33.250 --> 47:35.050]  There's gotta be something.
[47:36.630 --> 47:37.930]  Oh, there it is.
[47:38.190 --> 47:38.590]  There you go.
[47:38.990 --> 47:42.490]  Spingle, Spingle, Homing Missile Spongelchuff.
[47:43.610 --> 47:45.350]  You're pointing at Spongelchuff.
[47:45.350 --> 47:46.330]  That's what I'm talking about.
[47:46.390 --> 47:46.970]  Alright, baby.
[47:47.490 --> 47:47.770]  Give it everything you got.
[47:47.770 --> 47:49.590]  I'm not gonna get to use the Super Sheik.
[47:50.290 --> 47:50.770]  No!
[47:51.870 --> 47:52.350]  Mikey!
[47:55.070 --> 47:56.950]  Son of a bitch, Nick.
[47:57.010 --> 47:57.890]  That's what I'm talking about.
[47:59.490 --> 48:02.290]  Oh, were you two guys together last time, Nick?
[48:02.510 --> 48:02.990]  Yeah.
[48:03.450 --> 48:03.770]  Yeah.
[48:03.890 --> 48:04.930]  And Gavin's out!
[48:08.130 --> 48:10.030]  Is that what you wanted, Nick, you bastard?
[48:10.530 --> 48:11.590]  That is what I wanted.
[48:12.550 --> 48:13.490]  Thanks for water, Chris.
[48:17.290 --> 48:19.430]  Water Chris is so much shittier than Chris.
[48:21.070 --> 48:21.570]  Definitely.
[48:21.890 --> 48:23.430]  You really are into Chris, man.
[48:23.750 --> 48:24.190]  No!
[48:24.190 --> 48:25.910]  He's better than Water Chris.
[48:26.370 --> 48:27.590]  No, if you let me live!
[48:27.710 --> 48:27.970]  Okay.
[48:28.890 --> 48:29.450]  I'm in trouble.
[48:30.830 --> 48:31.330]  Okay.
[48:32.950 --> 48:33.770]  Didn't need it.
[48:34.450 --> 48:36.450]  I just threw a rocket into the air.
[48:36.810 --> 48:39.210]  I just gripped it and ripped it, baby.
[48:43.110 --> 48:43.890]  Alright, boys.
[48:44.030 --> 48:44.510]  The last three.
[48:44.610 --> 48:45.130]  The final three.
[48:45.210 --> 48:47.150]  Smash Mouth, Gum, and Phoenician Scheme.
[48:47.530 --> 48:49.350]  How is Gum gonna get the height he needs
[48:49.350 --> 48:50.250]  without mine in the way?
[48:50.610 --> 48:51.430]  Yeah, it's tough.
[48:52.050 --> 48:53.350]  Yeah, Gum's got a lot to consider.
[48:53.370 --> 48:54.410]  My name is Gum.
[48:55.690 --> 48:56.730]  Oops, not what I want.
[48:57.310 --> 48:58.050]  Yeah, not that.
[48:59.010 --> 49:00.350]  Oh, yeah, you got it.
[49:00.870 --> 49:01.270]  No.
[49:02.590 --> 49:03.390]  Oh, interesting.
[49:03.870 --> 49:04.270]  Oh!
[49:06.250 --> 49:07.310]  God, I hate the coughing.
[49:11.760 --> 49:12.860]  Went for a small one.
[49:13.080 --> 49:13.480]  Good cover?
[49:14.100 --> 49:15.200]  I don't know how to make it bigger.
[49:15.780 --> 49:17.340]  You made it bigger, then you made it small again.
[49:17.600 --> 49:18.780]  I made it bigger when it was tall.
[49:19.160 --> 49:21.120]  I don't know how to make it bigger when it wasn't tall.
[49:21.980 --> 49:23.640]  You just spin it all the way around and it becomes bigger.
[49:23.640 --> 49:25.300]  You spin it all the way around.
[49:25.500 --> 49:25.720]  Alright.
[49:26.260 --> 49:28.700]  On your turn, which you don't have because you are dead.
[49:31.120 --> 49:31.440]  Nick!
[49:31.680 --> 49:32.680]  Nick, you fool!
[49:34.880 --> 49:35.860]  I thought it was...
[49:35.860 --> 49:36.740]  You can do...
[49:36.740 --> 49:37.220]  No!
[49:37.900 --> 49:38.920]  What did you think?
[49:39.200 --> 49:39.520]  What did you think?
[49:39.520 --> 49:40.320]  What do you mean, you thought?
[49:44.770 --> 49:46.070]  What do you think this does?
[49:46.930 --> 49:48.770]  What do you guys think this does?
[49:48.890 --> 49:49.150]  Uh-oh.
[49:49.950 --> 49:50.550]  Earthquake!
[49:52.230 --> 49:53.590]  We'll never know.
[49:54.230 --> 49:55.310]  We'll never know.
[49:55.350 --> 49:55.750]  How did I do that?
[49:57.930 --> 49:58.950]  I pulled an Andrew.
[50:03.110 --> 50:04.150]  I pulled an Andrew.
[50:04.310 --> 50:05.970]  He talked all this shit about the mouse.
[50:06.190 --> 50:09.350]  He decided to go to the game and he jumped on with it.
[50:09.930 --> 50:11.310]  Today is my day.
[50:13.050 --> 50:14.050]  Oh my god.
[50:14.350 --> 50:15.630]  Oh my god.
[50:16.170 --> 50:17.130]  Oh fuck.
[50:17.470 --> 50:18.850]  What do we need to do, a bonus speed round?
[50:18.970 --> 50:21.010]  Yeah, how do we do the fastest round?
[50:21.290 --> 50:22.370]  Sudden sinking sounds good.
[50:22.570 --> 50:24.870]  Don't make us pick our fucking locations again.
[50:25.010 --> 50:25.550]  Yeah, no kidding.
[50:25.630 --> 50:25.770]  I don't wanna.
[50:27.070 --> 50:27.550]  What?
[50:29.690 --> 50:31.410]  Can you change worm health to 50?
[50:31.770 --> 50:33.130]  In honor of the frog.
[50:34.070 --> 50:34.550]  Oh!
[50:35.150 --> 50:36.690]  In honor of the frog!
[50:39.530 --> 50:40.230]  Ready up.
[50:40.750 --> 50:41.810]  Alright, here we go boys.
[50:41.810 --> 50:43.070]  Both fucked up.
[50:43.810 --> 50:45.590]  Thanks for the sub, Eric Bedor.
[50:46.010 --> 50:46.370]  What?
[50:47.610 --> 50:49.270]  Oh no, Binti's spuds!
[50:49.630 --> 50:51.430]  Just for that, gift me a sub.
[50:53.430 --> 50:56.510]  Why would it put Binti all the way down there with no one else?
[50:59.470 --> 51:00.170]  Oh, you're coming down?
[51:00.630 --> 51:00.930]  Yeah.
[51:02.930 --> 51:04.330]  Oh, that was my turn!
[51:04.330 --> 51:04.750]  Yeah!
[51:08.810 --> 51:13.550]  I was coming down, I was just gonna use the prod and that was gonna be it.
[51:13.690 --> 51:15.330]  I was just gonna prod you and you were gonna die.
[51:15.550 --> 51:16.210]  That sucks.
[51:18.270 --> 51:19.110]  Uh-huh.
[51:21.130 --> 51:21.950]  Andrew, thoughts?
[51:22.790 --> 51:24.890]  I'm just looking, there's some interesting stuff in here.
[51:25.430 --> 51:25.710]  Okay.
[51:25.870 --> 51:26.650]  Oh, what's this?
[51:27.650 --> 51:28.090]  Oh.
[51:29.350 --> 51:30.410]  There's a lot in here.
[51:31.490 --> 51:33.810]  Suicide bomber is different to kamikaze?
[51:33.810 --> 51:34.510]  Yeah.
[51:34.870 --> 51:36.810]  Maybe it's just you set him off where he is.
[51:37.050 --> 51:38.710]  Suicide bomber's doing it.
[51:39.170 --> 51:40.730]  Kamikaze's, he's just doing it for kicks.
[51:40.870 --> 51:43.230]  Suicide bomber has a whole religious ideology behind it.
[51:50.250 --> 51:51.210]  Oh dear.
[51:51.710 --> 51:52.970]  Oh my god!
[51:53.990 --> 51:54.890]  Oh, it burns!
[51:55.030 --> 51:55.450]  It burns!
[51:57.130 --> 52:00.150]  There we go, Gduff gifted me a sub, thank you very much.
[52:01.070 --> 52:01.550]  You...
[52:01.550 --> 52:02.830]  Thank you, Gduff.
[52:07.000 --> 52:07.800]  Backstreet boys!
[52:08.140 --> 52:09.580]  Oh, he looks buggled, Gduff.
[52:09.900 --> 52:11.540]  Oh, there's so much fire on that frog.
[52:11.900 --> 52:12.640]  Admiral Chops!
[52:13.020 --> 52:13.740]  Oh, thanks, Admiral Chops.
[52:13.740 --> 52:14.480]  He's gifted five subs, wow.
[52:14.880 --> 52:15.380]  Thank you.
[52:18.560 --> 52:20.980]  Man, I'm gonna be honest with you, the frog's a real hellhole.
[52:22.980 --> 52:24.580]  You're not enjoying Mark the Frog at this?
[52:24.580 --> 52:25.440]  Holy shit!
[52:25.440 --> 52:28.300]  I like the frog, it's what's on top of the frog that has me working.
[52:28.300 --> 52:29.300]  Yeah, I just freak out looking.
[52:29.980 --> 52:30.140]  20!
[52:30.140 --> 52:31.760]  Our 3D Gamer, 20 gifted.
[52:32.400 --> 52:33.540]  Holy shit, thank you.
[52:33.600 --> 52:33.640]  Whoa!
[52:33.640 --> 52:35.020]  Thank you so much.
[52:35.020 --> 52:38.220]  Getting crazy, we're on the Mark the Frog level, this is going nuts.
[52:38.540 --> 52:38.780]  Wow.
[52:39.100 --> 52:39.860]  Already did 10.
[52:40.400 --> 52:41.060]  Oh, shit.
[52:41.240 --> 52:41.880]  That's insane.
[52:43.420 --> 52:43.820]  Jesus.
[52:43.880 --> 52:44.460]  What was that?
[52:45.860 --> 52:46.260]  Fuck.
[52:48.220 --> 52:49.700]  There was some bounce back there.
[52:49.960 --> 52:51.040]  God, can I go?
[52:51.280 --> 52:53.180]  Oh, two of my wums are about to drown already.
[52:53.800 --> 52:54.640]  No, we'll be alright.
[53:01.040 --> 53:01.840]  Smash Mouth!
[53:02.760 --> 53:03.120]  Uh-oh.
[53:03.280 --> 53:04.760]  Appreciate you, our 3D Gamer, thank you.
[53:05.960 --> 53:07.840]  What the fuck was that?
[53:10.300 --> 53:12.480]  Well, we discovered a lot about physics.
[53:14.100 --> 53:14.600]  Uh-oh.
[53:14.900 --> 53:15.500]  Uh-oh.
[53:15.620 --> 53:16.240]  Oh, shit.
[53:16.520 --> 53:18.300]  Oh, no, it's fun-chungle time.
[53:18.620 --> 53:21.760]  You thought it was a fun-chuff and it's fucking not, idiot.
[53:22.440 --> 53:23.600]  Yeah, you got the other uncle.
[53:26.300 --> 53:26.980]  He's chungling.
[53:27.880 --> 53:28.180]  Uh-oh.
[53:28.640 --> 53:29.560]  He's chungling!
[53:30.160 --> 53:31.940]  I don't know how to use the web select!
[53:31.940 --> 53:34.480]  For God's sake!
[53:35.720 --> 53:36.880]  Yeah, I don't know why you did that.
[53:36.900 --> 53:38.780]  It came up for a split second and then it went.
[53:38.780 --> 53:39.780]  Yeah, there goes chungle time.
[53:48.620 --> 53:50.120]  Andrew, do you want to find out?
[53:51.100 --> 53:51.780]  Oh, please.
[53:52.260 --> 53:54.320]  Disney wants to find out.
[53:55.080 --> 53:56.080]  Oh, my God.
[53:56.700 --> 53:57.600]  Disney has a virus?
[53:58.740 --> 54:00.580]  It makes you sick also?
[54:01.120 --> 54:01.520]  Wow.
[54:01.520 --> 54:02.300]  You make yourself sick?
[54:02.460 --> 54:03.000]  And only you?
[54:03.260 --> 54:04.480]  Stink blew up.
[54:04.480 --> 54:04.760]  Yeah.
[54:04.980 --> 54:07.800]  I mean, it killed me, but then at the same time, damn, that was crazy.
[54:08.240 --> 54:09.680]  Came with the old stink bang.
[54:10.060 --> 54:10.300]  Yeah.
[54:13.080 --> 54:13.840]  Stink bang.
[54:14.700 --> 54:15.340]  Oh, what's that?
[54:16.380 --> 54:16.680]  Uh-oh.
[54:16.780 --> 54:17.160]  Gravity.
[54:17.820 --> 54:18.320]  What does that do?
[54:18.740 --> 54:18.940]  Whoa!
[54:19.400 --> 54:20.340]  Can you jump real high now?
[54:21.380 --> 54:21.740]  Whoa!
[54:22.300 --> 54:23.100]  Oh, cool.
[54:23.200 --> 54:23.800]  Jump the gap.
[54:24.520 --> 54:24.920]  Whoa!
[54:25.120 --> 54:25.580]  That's cool.
[54:26.200 --> 54:27.100]  Jump on the frog.
[54:27.800 --> 54:28.760]  Yeah, jump on the frog.
[54:28.780 --> 54:28.960]  Yeah, go to the frog.
[54:28.960 --> 54:30.600]  There's no way you can make that, can you?
[54:30.780 --> 54:31.120]  You can make it.
[54:31.160 --> 54:31.620]  He can't make it.
[54:31.700 --> 54:33.120]  He's got low gravity.
[54:33.360 --> 54:34.380]  Wrong way.
[54:34.600 --> 54:34.940]  Wrong way.
[54:35.020 --> 54:35.300]  Jump forward.
[54:35.300 --> 54:36.460]  You want to hit the forward jump button.
[54:36.620 --> 54:37.320]  There's a forward jump button.
[54:37.320 --> 54:38.220]  There's a wind going with you too.
[54:38.460 --> 54:39.300]  No, no, Andrew.
[54:41.100 --> 54:42.620]  Andrew, there's a forward jump button.
[54:42.820 --> 54:42.960]  What are you doing?
[54:43.080 --> 54:43.480]  I did it.
[54:44.620 --> 54:45.740]  Oh, my God.
[54:45.920 --> 54:46.540]  Oh, no good.
[54:46.680 --> 54:47.180]  Did you good?
[54:47.280 --> 54:47.360]  Did you good?
[54:47.360 --> 54:48.020]  Break you, let's jump.
[54:50.220 --> 54:52.900]  On my screen, I did not know where he was going.
[54:53.640 --> 54:54.100]  Oh, God.
[54:55.300 --> 54:55.940]  That's great.
[54:56.440 --> 54:57.440]  It's okay, he's going to run out of time.
[54:57.460 --> 54:57.940]  It doesn't matter.
[54:57.940 --> 54:58.900]  Fuck.
[55:04.480 --> 55:06.120]  Oh, you got a load.
[55:08.160 --> 55:08.760]  Hello.
[55:13.860 --> 55:14.400]  Yeah.
[55:15.420 --> 55:17.060]  Fucking baseball bat his ass.
[55:17.640 --> 55:18.180]  Home run, bitch.
[55:18.600 --> 55:18.800]  Oh, no.
[55:19.840 --> 55:20.780]  Fitment to hell.
[55:22.240 --> 55:23.300]  Ratty boy didn't do nothing.
[55:23.920 --> 55:25.540]  Kill the ratty boy now.
[55:26.180 --> 55:26.800]  Ratty boy.
[55:27.100 --> 55:29.180]  Do we have prod on this scheme?
[55:29.180 --> 55:30.680]  I don't know.
[55:30.740 --> 55:34.320]  Using my presidential orders to fucking kill his rat ass, bitch.
[55:38.060 --> 55:38.420]  Goodbye.
[55:41.100 --> 55:42.640]  Like Robert De Niro and the Untouchables.
[55:43.160 --> 55:47.680]  What am I going to do with cum?
[55:49.660 --> 55:50.680]  You don't know by now.
[55:52.540 --> 55:53.260]  He's everywhere.
[55:53.820 --> 55:55.300]  He's just been collecting it this whole time.
[55:55.500 --> 55:57.200]  At some point, I'm going to figure it out.
[55:57.220 --> 55:58.180]  And I'm going to have a lot.
[55:59.180 --> 56:00.560]  You're going to mine yourself?
[56:01.680 --> 56:02.360]  No.
[56:02.800 --> 56:04.120]  How else do I get it?
[56:06.360 --> 56:07.040]  What?
[56:08.440 --> 56:09.460]  It's a cum joke.
[56:14.270 --> 56:14.950]  Whoa.
[56:16.190 --> 56:17.890]  Tactical cum time.
[56:18.950 --> 56:19.130]  No!
[56:21.410 --> 56:23.490]  Venetian scheme never stood a chance.
[56:24.430 --> 56:25.110]  All right.
[56:25.150 --> 56:25.910]  I know what I have to do.
[56:26.210 --> 56:26.550]  Okay.
[56:27.310 --> 56:28.670]  It's a two-stage plan.
[56:29.030 --> 56:29.390]  Okay.
[56:29.390 --> 56:29.470]  Okay.
[56:30.390 --> 56:30.910]  All right.
[56:31.290 --> 56:32.270]  Stage one.
[56:33.390 --> 56:34.230]  Stage one.
[56:34.770 --> 56:35.870]  Stand here.
[56:37.830 --> 56:38.670]  Stage two.
[56:39.290 --> 56:40.110]  Long girder.
[56:40.570 --> 56:41.530]  Oh my god.
[56:42.370 --> 56:43.210]  Eli Benj.
[56:43.290 --> 56:44.070]  25 gifted.
[56:44.650 --> 56:45.830]  Oh, thank you so much, Eli.
[56:46.390 --> 56:47.310]  Dude, this is wild.
[56:47.410 --> 56:49.330]  What an anniversary weekend we're about to walk into.
[56:49.470 --> 56:51.550]  If you're watching this on Tuesday, enjoy.
[56:52.390 --> 56:53.890]  I was looking at Eli Benj.
[56:54.050 --> 56:55.610]  I was getting Benj'd in the middle of my turn.
[56:55.930 --> 56:56.750]  Did you just get Benj'd?
[56:57.130 --> 56:57.950]  I got Benj'd.
[56:57.950 --> 56:59.110]  Damn, bro.
[56:59.190 --> 56:59.770]  All right.
[56:59.810 --> 57:00.510]  I don't know what this does.
[57:00.690 --> 57:02.030]  This is for the Benjmeister.
[57:02.190 --> 57:02.610]  All right.
[57:02.750 --> 57:04.050]  Are you not going to place that girder then?
[57:06.110 --> 57:06.550]  What?!
[57:07.870 --> 57:08.690]  It's frozen.
[57:09.470 --> 57:10.530]  I just froze myself.
[57:10.970 --> 57:11.770]  Kodiak's Law.
[57:11.970 --> 57:12.910]  20 gifted.
[57:13.690 --> 57:14.990]  Smash Mouth, let's go.
[57:15.490 --> 57:16.010]  What is that?
[57:16.370 --> 57:17.490]  Smash Mouth just drowned.
[57:17.730 --> 57:19.090]  Kodiak's Law, this is for you.
[57:20.610 --> 57:21.330]  Backstreet Boys.
[57:24.620 --> 57:25.920]  This is going to be bad.
[57:26.460 --> 57:28.340]  I don't want to kill this bitch ass.
[57:29.780 --> 57:31.480]  This is going to be bad.
[57:31.760 --> 57:33.420]  Hey, get to chopping, bitch.
[57:33.960 --> 57:34.280]  No!
[57:36.220 --> 57:38.980]  You're sick and you're chopped in half, you dead ass worm.
[57:39.140 --> 57:40.580]  That was the best case scenario.
[57:41.220 --> 57:41.500]  No!
[57:45.880 --> 57:47.200]  Disney lives again!
[57:48.420 --> 57:49.480]  Come on, Backstreet Boys.
[57:49.600 --> 57:50.180]  Let it be me.
[57:50.280 --> 57:50.920]  Let it be you.
[57:51.660 --> 57:54.000]  You can change your worm when it's your turn.
[57:54.940 --> 57:55.960]  It's going to be me.
[57:56.560 --> 57:57.280]  How do you change your worm?
[57:57.940 --> 57:59.500]  Isn't it like right trigger or something?
[58:00.060 --> 58:01.280]  I think you can change your...
[58:02.240 --> 58:03.600]  Oh my god.
[58:03.980 --> 58:04.540]  I think it's...
[58:04.540 --> 58:05.100]  No!
[58:05.420 --> 58:05.820]  Fuck!
[58:06.120 --> 58:06.420]  No!
[58:06.620 --> 58:07.320]  No, Disney!
[58:07.760 --> 58:08.100]  Disney!
[58:08.720 --> 58:09.720]  No, bring her back!
[58:10.260 --> 58:11.500]  Kodiak's Law, that was for you.
[58:11.540 --> 58:12.900]  20 gifted, that was incredible.
[58:13.780 --> 58:14.200]  I'm out of the game!
[58:14.200 --> 58:14.900]  That was a terrible turn.
[58:15.300 --> 58:16.540]  I'm out of the game also.
[58:16.600 --> 58:18.480]  Double suicide on Mark's face.
[58:19.180 --> 58:19.380]  Dude.
[58:20.440 --> 58:21.080]  I'm out.
[58:21.620 --> 58:23.800]  At the same time as 20 gifted subs from Kodiak's Law.
[58:23.800 --> 58:24.500]  Oh, I still have Nike.
[58:25.200 --> 58:25.620]  Oh!
[58:26.820 --> 58:29.140]  Guys, we're only four minutes away from the best time of the week.
[58:29.920 --> 58:31.160]  We're so close.
[58:33.160 --> 58:35.360]  What are you going to do with the whole icy boy?
[58:36.520 --> 58:37.880]  Oh wait, your whole team's frozen?
[58:38.180 --> 58:39.020]  I froze my team.
[58:40.380 --> 58:41.080]  What good does that do?
[58:41.080 --> 58:43.420]  From front to back with zero degrees.
[58:45.020 --> 58:46.220]  Do we have any flamethrowers?
[58:46.780 --> 58:47.020]  Yeah.
[58:47.160 --> 58:48.040]  Oh, can you thaw me out?
[58:48.620 --> 58:49.740]  Light his ass up!
[58:50.020 --> 58:50.660]  Not my ass.
[58:52.200 --> 58:52.980]  Hey, what's that?
[58:54.140 --> 58:55.900]  Oh my God!
[58:57.000 --> 58:58.660]  Hey, what's that?
[58:59.960 --> 59:04.340]  A little more petrol on you.
[59:12.870 --> 59:15.110]  Um has so much health.
[59:21.290 --> 59:22.510]  He's just thinking.
[59:23.850 --> 59:25.290]  What you doing with that?
[59:25.910 --> 59:26.910]  Not into the icy boys.
[59:28.110 --> 59:29.150]  That was a hell of a dom.
[59:32.090 --> 59:33.550]  You think this is the combine?
[59:33.990 --> 59:34.750]  What was that?
[59:36.570 --> 59:37.610]  Kodiak's Law did nothing?
[59:37.630 --> 59:38.710]  My draft stocks were like...
[59:38.710 --> 59:38.970]  No!
[59:39.190 --> 59:40.850]  I think the Cardinals are interested.
[59:41.730 --> 59:42.470]  Holy shit.
[59:43.650 --> 59:44.450]  Holy shit.
[59:46.150 --> 59:50.570]  Dude, Kodiak's Law is going nuts right now as we get on to 5.01. It's so close.
[59:50.830 --> 59:51.550]  So close.
[59:51.850 --> 59:53.710]  Dude, I'm itching for it. This is wild.
[59:54.030 --> 59:55.010]  It's been a hell of a week.
[59:56.410 --> 59:57.770]  It's going to be a hell of a weekend.
[59:58.110 --> 01:00:01.210]  A lot of background prep this week to get ready for this weekend.
[01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:04.370]  Yeah, Sunday at 11 a.m. be here.
[01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.210]  Be here on Twitch.
[01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:10.070]  We are going to have some cool surprises. We're going to have a 30-turn Mario party.
[01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.810]  There's going to be a lot going on, but Saturday we'll also have some birthday surprises too.
[01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:16.090]  Wow, what a jump. That was pretty incredible.
[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.270]  Okay, alright.
[01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:20.450]  I'm coming back.
[01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:23.490]  He's just doing tricks.
[01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.590]  He silently did all that. He didn't make a noise.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.670]  Nuh-uh. Parkour.
[01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.790]  Are you going to prod him?
[01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.930]  Are you going to prod him?
[01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:32.190]  Yes!
[01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:32.950]  It worked! It worked!
[01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:33.430]  Damn it.
[01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:35.510]  Awesome.
[01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:39.390]  He showed you my acrobatics and then poked you to death.
[01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:42.270]  Will there be a VOD of Sunday? Yes. If you can't join us live, don't worry.
[01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:44.130]  We'll post everything that we're doing on Sunday.
[01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.950]  We'll post it all later, kind of throughout the week.
[01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:50.170]  So stay tuned, but Sunday you want to be here at 11 a.m.
[01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:54.190]  And also stay tuned for Saturday for some cool surprises also.
[01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:56.870]  Whoa! That's tomorrow.
[01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:57.890]  Yeah, that's tomorrow.
[01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:02.570]  And then also, noon, central time on Sunday, we'll have our merch on sale.
[01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:05.370]  Watch, check out the patch shirt. Patch shirt rules.
[01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:07.570]  Watch this.
[01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.230]  What are you thinking?
[01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:11.450]  I'm taking us all out at once.
[01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:12.230]  Yeah, you are.
[01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:14.970]  Wow.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.400]  Alright, Dumb. Let's see what you got.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.680]  Dumb's final move.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.000]  I believe in you.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.760]  Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.120]  More health than everyone else combined.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.100]  Insane.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.920]  Wind is not in your favor.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.580]  Oh, the wind. I forgot about the wind.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.040]  Well, you've closed off that area for them.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.520]  Oh, it's the Glug.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.780]  They can't escape to it.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.320]  Hey, Glug. Shoot jungle.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.800]  You should whack cum into the fire.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.600]  You should what?
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:00.920]  I'm saving it.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.700]  You should whack cum into the...
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.780]  But Nick doesn't know what to do with it.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.920]  Guys, it's nearly 5.01. Get the countdown going.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:08.980]  Almost there.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:09.780]  Why me?
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.660]  10 seconds.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:11.860]  Why me?
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.620]  Under 10 seconds.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.160]  How do I use it?
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.300]  Hit it with a 5.01. Let's see it.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:17.620]  What are you doing?
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:18.380]  Oh, no.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.320]  Best time of the week.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:19.960]  Oh, 5.01.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:20.920]  5.01.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.640]  Time to clock out, boys.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.840]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.580]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.640]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.120]  I've muffed it.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.320]  What did you muff?
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:30.780]  Gavin.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.520]  That's ridiculous.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.200]  Get the stuff.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.900]  Why wouldn't you get the stuff?
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.400]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.840]  Johan Bach with the 5.01.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.360]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.460]  5.01, bro.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.520]  Did you just call it Johan?
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:48.560]  Johan.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.660]  Johan Bach.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.160]  Nicky.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.140]  All right.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.980]  Geoff, there's two pinks.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:56.920]  There's cum and bum.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.260]  Kodiak's again with another 20.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.560]  Holy shit.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.640]  That's like 60 subs today.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.520]  This anniversary is wild today.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.520]  Oh, no.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:06.520]  Bum.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.500]  Oh, no.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:08.140]  Bum skip.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.140]  And once again, it's not even our anniversary.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.360]  No, not yet.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:11.720]  Soon.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.120]  Two days.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.720]  It's the anniversary of the day before the day we got laid off, which we talked about
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:17.840]  earlier.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:21.400]  Tomorrow is the anniversary of us getting shit canned.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.340]  And then Sunday, the anniversary.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.040]  And Eric, how old are you turning?
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:25.980]  39.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:27.640]  Whoa.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.420]  I know, you're telling me, brother.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.280]  Wait, Nick, you took me out last game.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.280]  Eric's entering into late stage adult.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.020]  All right.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.620]  Well, no, not me.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.660]  But I'm your friend.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.080]  We're all friends.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:41.040]  Is this a pigeon?
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.620]  Oh, he lived.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:45.880]  Oh, he might be alive.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.020]  I might live through that.
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:49.800]  He is alive.
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:52.820]  He's disappointed in you.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.000]  Yeah, I'm disappointed in me, too.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.040]  Oh, it's getting windy.
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.480]  What is that?
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.380]  Funt skunkle.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:01.200]  Well.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.460]  Funt skunkle.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.260]  He's gone.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.480]  Skunk sickness.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.000]  He has skunk them.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:10.820]  That's great.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.580]  He just murdered a skunk for no reason.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.000]  20 more from Kodiak's Law.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.980]  Kodiak's is insane today.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.420]  Absolute lunatic.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.220]  Kodiak's Law is putting up crucified donkey numbers.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.140]  Kill Gavin.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.160]  Kill Gavin.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.880]  Take out Nick, he's so healthy.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.320]  Shadow Alliance.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.320]  I'm sick as a dog.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.240]  100 subs from Kodiak's Law.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.360]  I got skunked.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.020]  I got skunked.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.300]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.040]  I gotta do this one because of the way it works.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:42.260]  Yeah.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.760]  Why would you...
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.760]  God damn it.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.040]  God damn it.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.560]  God damn it.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.680]  You just tiptoed onto the flames.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:04:59.600]  Incredible.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:00.920]  Yeah.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.800]  Oh, use the bat. Use the bat. Use the bat. Use the bat.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.860]  Use the bat. Use the bat. Use the bat.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.760]  Get right on top of him.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.020]  You really want to take out Gavin, don't you?
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.860]  Pretend it's dollar hot dog night.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.320]  I didn't even...
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.500]  I didn't even attack you.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.040]  Whoa!
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:15.860]  Krim style.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.200]  He went flying.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.000]  Two for three today, I guess.
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.600]  You could have hit him into me.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.460]  Krim style.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.800]  Hey, thanks for telling me that now.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:24.120]  Yeah.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.060]  Alright, I gotta get over there.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.340]  Yeah, come on over.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.100]  You gotta get there.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.180]  You can do it, Funt.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.580]  Can a sheep make the jump? No.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.080]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.520]  Yeah, sheep cannon can.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:36.920]  Yeah.
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.340]  Fast walk.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:39.020]  Sheep cannon, yeah.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.200]  Also, there will definitely be a VOD.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.320]  Don't you worry about it.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.500]  You don't have to get up at 4 a.m.
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:46.680]  Unless you want to.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:48.560]  Funt?
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.200]  Whoa!
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.620]  What the hell's going on over here?
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:51.960]  Whoa.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.860]  There's a secret island that we've all missed?
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.360]  Yeah, right?
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.860]  You looking for places to warp?
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.260]  Okay.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.140]  He's beaming.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:03.460]  Okay.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.400]  Alright.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.140]  No!
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:05.740]  Oh, no.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.280]  He's gonna trap cum.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.160]  Uh...
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:11.940]  Uh...
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:12.980]  You...
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.200]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:14.500]  Build it.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.520]  You want to build it a little bit higher?
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.720]  But then can I get on?
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.360]  Can I...
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.060]  Well, I guess you're not gonna find out, are you?
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:21.480]  You're done.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.940]  You can't get out of the damn menu!
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.480]  You fucking moron.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.080]  This is gonna be anticlimactic if you try.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.400]  You don't even have to do anything, Nick.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.500]  You just have to wait him out.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.320]  You can just skip rope, Nick.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.540]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.400]  No, come over here.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:35.500]  Oh!
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.040]  Oh!
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.800]  What the fuck?
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.000]  Why?
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.500]  The menu!
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.500]  I forgot the menu!
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.260]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:43.560]  He drowned.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.160]  He still won.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:44.900]  Wow!
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.240]  Cum has done it!
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.000]  Cum everywhere!
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.640]  Celebrate cum!
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.100]  Cum's in the chat.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.000]  Just a sick cum at the end.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.940]  Congratulations, Nick.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:53.400]  Oh!
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:54.580]  Thank you.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:55.620]  Incredible.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.100]  Way to go.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.440]  Way to go, boys.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.080]  And that was in honor of Mark the Frog.

[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.840]  Yeah, what Eric said.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.100]  Time for two.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.520]  But with 10% more emotion and feeling.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.220]  Alright, this sucks.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.120]  Alright, thanks for joining us through 501, guys.
