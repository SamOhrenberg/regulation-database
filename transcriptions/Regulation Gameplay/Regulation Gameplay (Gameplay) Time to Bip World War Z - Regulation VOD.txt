[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  So, are these Pillsbury Snoopy cookies real or what?
[00:04.180 --> 00:05.760]  Who would lie about such a thing?
[00:06.120 --> 00:06.500]  I don't know.
[00:06.560 --> 00:06.960]  Are they sugar?
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.040]  They look great, yeah.
[00:08.560 --> 00:14.260]  Yeah, they got... it's Snoopy's face on a cookie, and then the box of Snoopy eating a cookie, which is a lot of fun.
[00:15.440 --> 00:15.800]  Um...
[00:15.800 --> 00:17.460]  If you're Snoopy and you can have your own face...
[00:17.460 --> 00:20.700]  Like, imagine having your face on a cookie and then you go, man, great cookie.
[00:21.840 --> 00:24.880]  I feel like you like Snoopy... you would buy Snoopy water.
[00:25.660 --> 00:29.000]  Uh, I don't think I'd buy Snoopy water. If there was Snoopy coffee, I'd have Snoopy coffee.
[00:29.440 --> 00:31.140]  I don't think I'd trust Snoopy water.
[00:31.460 --> 00:31.900]  No.
[00:32.180 --> 00:34.240]  Like, that's some real dog water stuff, you know what I mean?
[00:34.340 --> 00:35.380]  Literal dog water.
[00:35.540 --> 00:35.700]  Yeah.
[00:36.060 --> 00:41.100]  Hey, what's with this... what's with the... where's the Spum one from? Who's It's Pat? That's not even us.
[00:42.580 --> 00:46.080]  Just making Spum stuff on your own channel? You little freak.
[00:48.820 --> 00:49.700]  The fuck?
[00:51.980 --> 00:52.940]  Freak mode, bro.
[00:53.320 --> 00:56.080]  The hell? Did you see we did get new emotes though, Gavin?
[00:57.180 --> 00:57.880]  We did?
[00:57.880 --> 00:59.420]  Uh-huh, there's an Ian.
[01:01.260 --> 01:02.680]  And there's a Gerpler.
[01:03.240 --> 01:05.220]  Oh, I see the... the Gerpler looks nice.
[01:05.480 --> 01:07.900]  Hey, thanks, Seb. Appreciate the gifted subs.
[01:07.940 --> 01:08.060]  Wow.
[01:08.460 --> 01:09.220]  Thank you so much.
[01:09.560 --> 01:09.740]  Yeah.
[01:09.840 --> 01:10.440]  Thank you.
[01:10.940 --> 01:12.020]  From... oh, it's gone.
[01:12.420 --> 01:12.980]  We just called him Seb.
[01:13.160 --> 01:15.840]  The chat's moving all the fucking emotes.
[01:16.040 --> 01:18.200]  That's a torrent of Gerplers.
[01:19.180 --> 01:20.320]  A whole torrent of them.
[01:20.620 --> 01:21.400]  And they're Gerple color.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.300]  I guess I'm just gonna stick with Gunslinger.
[01:24.820 --> 01:25.000]  I...
[01:25.000 --> 01:25.640]  I am too.
[01:25.640 --> 01:27.240]  These all just seem like...
[01:27.240 --> 01:28.460]  I like the unslingsome guns.
[01:28.700 --> 01:31.400]  I don't think I'm smart enough to play like these other roles yet, so...
[01:32.060 --> 01:32.240]  Yeah.
[01:33.400 --> 01:34.200]  Gavin is a medic.
[01:34.200 --> 01:34.580]  I like gun.
[01:36.240 --> 01:36.580]  Sure.
[01:37.320 --> 01:38.020]  That's cool.
[01:38.180 --> 01:39.160]  That's what you chose.
[01:39.860 --> 01:40.620]  You can change that if you want.
[01:40.620 --> 01:44.000]  Well, that's what I started as, but I feel like maybe I should be a medic.
[01:44.820 --> 01:46.420]  You wanna be a medic? You wanna heal people?
[01:48.340 --> 01:50.960]  Oh, you got a bullet wound. Let's put some Branston in it.
[01:51.200 --> 01:51.840]  And heal it.
[01:52.800 --> 01:53.160]  Gross.
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.880]  I feel like you would rather bleed out than have me tend to your medical needs.
[01:58.280 --> 02:01.480]  I think... I think I'd like to see what you do.
[02:02.060 --> 02:02.500]  Yeah.
[02:02.740 --> 02:07.020]  I would have no hope that you would be able to fix me, but it would be funny at least.
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.180]  Yeah, what's the worst that can happen at that point?
[02:09.980 --> 02:12.220]  The character that Nick picked kind of looks like Gavin.
[02:13.160 --> 02:13.500]  A little.
[02:15.680 --> 02:16.140]  What's his name?
[02:16.140 --> 02:17.400]  Kinda looks like Glenn.
[02:18.880 --> 02:19.560]  Who's Glenn?
[02:20.240 --> 02:20.680]  Glenn?
[02:20.800 --> 02:22.080]  The Walking Dead, I'm assuming?
[02:22.180 --> 02:22.420]  No.
[02:22.420 --> 02:23.340]  What's that guy?
[02:24.620 --> 02:25.500]  Is that someone you made up?
[02:26.360 --> 02:26.580]  Yeah.
[02:26.860 --> 02:28.140]  Who's that famous Glenn?
[02:28.700 --> 02:30.380]  The Walking Dead, Glenn from The Walking Dead.
[02:30.380 --> 02:30.680]  Len Howerton?
[02:31.560 --> 02:31.960]  Nah.
[02:32.460 --> 02:32.800]  Yeah.
[02:34.420 --> 02:35.760]  Are you talking about the dude from Twisters?
[02:36.300 --> 02:37.100]  Yeah, what's that guy?
[02:37.660 --> 02:38.200]  Glenn Powell?
[02:38.800 --> 02:39.940]  Glenn Powell, that's the guy.
[02:39.940 --> 02:40.980]  Oh, he does look like Glenn Powell.
[02:41.060 --> 02:42.700]  I don't think that guy looks like Glenn Powell at all.
[02:43.560 --> 02:45.500]  Does he look more like me than Glenn Powell?
[02:45.800 --> 02:46.060]  Yeah.
[02:47.160 --> 02:47.920]  Ask your wife.
[02:48.180 --> 02:48.960]  Gavin, you wanna ready up?
[02:50.220 --> 02:50.620]  Yeah.
[02:55.550 --> 02:56.990]  Oh, all players are ready, that's great.
[02:58.570 --> 03:00.170]  Wait, who looks like Glenn Powell?
[03:01.410 --> 03:02.130]  Nick's character.
[03:02.610 --> 03:04.210]  Nobody looks like Glenn Powell.
[03:05.750 --> 03:07.410]  I don't think you look like Glenn Powell at all.
[03:08.050 --> 03:09.690]  Hey guys, you gotta stay away from toxic clouds.
[03:09.790 --> 03:12.030]  The poisonous gas will do serious damage over time.
[03:12.430 --> 03:12.790]  That's...
[03:12.790 --> 03:13.510]  We gotta get to the subway.
[03:14.430 --> 03:14.930]  Oh no.
[03:16.210 --> 03:20.190]  It'd be really funny to make a knockoff game called Left to Die instead of Left to Dead.
[03:21.270 --> 03:23.370]  Isn't that what that Back 4 Blood was?
[03:24.170 --> 03:26.770]  Yeah, but those were the same people at least, weren't they?
[03:27.250 --> 03:27.970]  Goddammit Bunko.
[03:30.910 --> 03:31.550]  Oh shit.
[03:31.670 --> 03:32.510]  I'm always saying that.
[03:33.110 --> 03:33.950]  Oh, there's zombies.
[03:37.050 --> 03:39.090]  Oh, so this is like the whole thing of the game, huh?
[03:39.250 --> 03:39.870]  It's a lot of these games.
[03:39.870 --> 03:42.430]  It is. This is what it was like trying to get an NES classic.
[03:44.310 --> 03:46.850]  Wow dude, what a callback.
[03:47.310 --> 03:48.670]  I forgot that was the whole thing.
[03:48.670 --> 03:49.330]  I'm still upset about it.
[03:49.910 --> 03:50.890]  Alright, I'm Ellis.
[03:51.950 --> 03:52.750]  I'll be coach.
[03:55.330 --> 03:57.910]  I guess I'll be Nick, my namesake.
[03:58.530 --> 04:03.590]  You said that Gavin and I immediately went to look for a health pack and like if I could swap my guns.
[04:03.970 --> 04:05.030]  I had the same thought.
[04:06.390 --> 04:07.590]  Okay, B is crouch.
[04:09.350 --> 04:10.370]  Yeah, I'm oozing.
[04:10.650 --> 04:11.490]  I'm oozing too.
[04:11.490 --> 04:12.730]  And I've got a silenced piss.
[04:13.310 --> 04:13.510]  That's cool.
[04:13.510 --> 04:15.050]  You can run with the stick.
[04:15.830 --> 04:16.070]  Uh oh.
[04:16.630 --> 04:17.170]  Oh god.
[04:18.170 --> 04:19.910]  Oh, there's a hand coming through this door.
[04:19.910 --> 04:20.210]  Oh god.
[04:20.210 --> 04:20.710]  Oh, there's a lot.
[04:20.750 --> 04:21.550]  There's a lot of zombies.
[04:21.630 --> 04:22.690]  Oh, there's a lot of zombies.
[04:23.290 --> 04:23.970]  Wow, there is a lot.
[04:23.970 --> 04:24.770]  This is pretty cool.
[04:25.150 --> 04:26.590]  There's a lot of zombies.
[04:27.050 --> 04:27.470]  Let's see.
[04:27.570 --> 04:28.110]  Oh shit.
[04:28.170 --> 04:28.410]  Ow.
[04:28.830 --> 04:29.090]  Nick.
[04:30.190 --> 04:30.810]  Eat shit.
[04:31.090 --> 04:32.290]  Oh wow, there's a bunch of guys right here.
[04:32.290 --> 04:33.170]  Oh shit.
[04:33.490 --> 04:34.370]  Oh shit.
[04:34.970 --> 04:35.610]  That was pretty cool.
[04:35.630 --> 04:36.110]  Reloading takes a bit.
[04:36.490 --> 04:38.890]  Oh, there's a big guy coming with the armor.
[04:39.050 --> 04:39.810]  You can ping.
[04:40.050 --> 04:41.330]  You can ping up on the D-pad.
[04:41.450 --> 04:41.650]  Okay.
[04:42.030 --> 04:42.170]  Thank you.
[04:42.950 --> 04:43.230]  Uh.
[04:43.570 --> 04:44.610]  What do we do with the shotgun?
[04:44.610 --> 04:45.550]  I don't know.
[04:45.810 --> 04:46.210]  Oh god.
[04:48.550 --> 04:49.110]  Kill him.
[04:50.470 --> 04:51.750]  Oh, things are bad.
[04:52.290 --> 04:53.050]  Die, you sorry body.
[04:53.050 --> 04:53.670]  Okay, we got him.
[04:54.270 --> 04:54.710]  Uh.
[04:55.490 --> 04:55.910]  Yeah, Nick.
[04:56.030 --> 04:58.530]  So I think our assessment before we started was right.
[04:58.910 --> 05:00.470]  It's a lot of guys.
[05:01.190 --> 05:02.350]  Everything dies pretty quick.
[05:03.250 --> 05:03.350]  Yeah.
[05:04.010 --> 05:04.290]  Oh.
[05:05.230 --> 05:06.230]  Okay, we can't go down there.
[05:08.810 --> 05:10.310]  Oh no, something's on me.
[05:10.970 --> 05:11.510]  I got you.
[05:11.570 --> 05:11.870]  I got you.
[05:12.090 --> 05:12.570]  Thank you.
[05:14.370 --> 05:15.850]  No, it's a lurker.
[05:16.010 --> 05:16.770]  I heard what he said.
[05:18.050 --> 05:19.930]  Oh, that guy's head got messy.
[05:20.190 --> 05:20.570]  Gonna reach that.
[05:21.030 --> 05:21.630]  Yeah, it happens.
[05:21.750 --> 05:23.190]  Our pistols are silenced, fellas.
[05:23.810 --> 05:25.070]  Does that matter?
[05:25.930 --> 05:27.510]  Yeah, let's go on Bip quest.
[05:27.710 --> 05:28.430]  Yeah, let's go Bip.
[05:28.950 --> 05:30.710]  We'll go Hitman style here.
[05:33.710 --> 05:35.190]  Bip, Bip, Bip.
[05:36.350 --> 05:38.310]  I don't think Bipping is doing anything for me here.
[05:38.490 --> 05:39.030]  Oh, behind you, Nick.
[05:39.490 --> 05:40.410]  You got Bip in the head.
[05:40.950 --> 05:41.190]  Thank you.
[05:42.450 --> 05:42.810]  Oh.
[05:43.390 --> 05:46.810]  Hey, here's a heavy assault shotgun.
[05:47.090 --> 05:48.890]  That's the opposite of a silenced pistol.
[05:49.250 --> 05:49.810]  Yeah, no thanks.
[05:50.010 --> 05:50.570]  You taking it?
[05:50.810 --> 05:51.350]  Yeah, I took it.
[05:53.870 --> 05:54.270]  Oh boy.
[05:54.390 --> 05:56.970]  Hey guys, I don't think Bipping is gonna be working here.
[05:56.970 --> 05:57.850]  Uh, uh, uh.
[05:57.850 --> 05:58.210]  What you talking about?
[05:58.390 --> 06:00.210]  Right now, this is a Bip-free zone.
[06:00.290 --> 06:01.430]  Oh, this is, uh...
[06:01.430 --> 06:02.070]  Where's the grenades?
[06:02.250 --> 06:02.530]  Oh shit.
[06:02.530 --> 06:03.450]  Keep backing up, keep backing up.
[06:03.570 --> 06:04.370]  Oh balls!
[06:04.570 --> 06:05.410]  Ah, keep...
[06:05.410 --> 06:06.930]  Oh, they're coming behind us too.
[06:07.690 --> 06:08.870]  I'm disinfecting my eye.
[06:09.290 --> 06:10.410]  Oh no. Oh my god.
[06:10.930 --> 06:12.070]  Oh, you're getting right again.
[06:12.170 --> 06:12.490]  Oh my god, help me.
[06:12.490 --> 06:13.230]  I'm trying to get you, Eric.
[06:13.990 --> 06:14.690]  I got you.
[06:15.190 --> 06:17.150]  I am absolutely screwed.
[06:17.410 --> 06:17.790]  Wow.
[06:18.950 --> 06:19.630]  How do you get...
[06:20.610 --> 06:21.970]  Holy fuck, Eric is dead.
[06:22.410 --> 06:23.310]  Oh, I'm dead.
[06:23.310 --> 06:24.630]  This guy's got a bomb!
[06:25.810 --> 06:26.990]  He's got a bomb!
[06:27.870 --> 06:28.310]  Fuck.
[06:28.990 --> 06:29.430]  Fuck.
[06:29.990 --> 06:30.290]  Fuck.
[06:30.710 --> 06:32.130]  Oh, I became a zombie?
[06:32.930 --> 06:34.750]  Oh shit, can I attack you guys?
[06:35.710 --> 06:37.570]  No, I can't control my own guy.
[06:38.830 --> 06:40.150]  You're gonna have to put me down.
[06:40.490 --> 06:41.790]  Yeah, you better kill me, Andrew.
[06:41.990 --> 06:43.030]  I'm right behind you.
[06:43.230 --> 06:43.990]  I'm done dying.
[06:44.130 --> 06:46.430]  Hell yeah, Andrew, I took you out.
[06:48.450 --> 06:50.030]  I killed you, Andrew, you're dead.
[06:50.210 --> 06:51.010]  You got me?
[06:51.310 --> 06:52.810]  Yeah, you're dead, bitch.
[06:54.370 --> 06:56.850]  Oh yeah, I guess this is a good time to mention we're playing on hard.
[06:58.370 --> 06:59.810]  I forgot about that.
[07:00.070 --> 07:03.970]  And once again, don't have a name burn, so anyone could be playing.
[07:04.910 --> 07:07.230]  Well, you're only seeing Nick's perspective.
[07:08.010 --> 07:08.490]  That's true.
[07:08.610 --> 07:09.230]  How do you know that?
[07:10.250 --> 07:13.230]  Because when Andrew streams it, it doesn't work right.
[07:13.470 --> 07:16.890]  And then you got mad at me last time, so, you know.
[07:19.330 --> 07:21.250]  Hey man, I'm getting better at the screen.
[07:21.250 --> 07:22.010]  You're doing great.
[07:22.010 --> 07:24.990]  I don't, I don't have, Nick, I have no notes for you, man.
[07:25.670 --> 07:26.090]  Getting better?
[07:26.290 --> 07:26.430]  Thanks, man.
[07:27.130 --> 07:29.130]  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, yeah.
[07:29.490 --> 07:30.990]  But you used to do it and now you don't.
[07:31.810 --> 07:32.530]  He's doing it now.
[07:33.590 --> 07:35.530]  But we don't need it for this one, because it's me.
[07:36.010 --> 07:36.930]  Yeah, but, okay.
[07:39.230 --> 07:40.570]  I'm not sure what the confusion is.
[07:40.670 --> 07:41.870]  I agree with you, Nick.
[07:42.930 --> 07:44.990]  I see Gavin's point, but he, you know.
[07:44.990 --> 07:46.050]  You don't want to know who they're watching?
[07:46.350 --> 07:48.570]  You could have brought it up before, just saying.
[07:49.130 --> 07:49.410]  Uh-huh.
[07:49.770 --> 07:50.590]  You know what, that's.
[07:50.590 --> 07:54.350]  I'll tell you what, before, we weren't streaming, so I couldn't see it.
[07:55.890 --> 07:57.870]  Right, but wouldn't you know that that's what it is?
[07:59.610 --> 08:02.670]  I know who's streaming, you silly bastard.
[08:02.870 --> 08:05.350]  I'm talking about people who've just tuned in.
[08:05.610 --> 08:06.850]  How do they know who they're watching?
[08:07.290 --> 08:10.270]  Right, right, but you were mad at Eric about this before.
[08:10.610 --> 08:10.950]  Are you ready?
[08:11.190 --> 08:13.550]  You're mad at Eric about this last week.
[08:13.990 --> 08:14.290]  Yeah.
[08:14.430 --> 08:15.310]  I'm gonna cut this right here.
[08:15.430 --> 08:18.030]  So now you gotta know that Nick also does it.
[08:18.090 --> 08:19.710]  So you gotta show up early to make sure.
[08:19.710 --> 08:21.970]  Yeah, I don't know why he didn't show up early.
[08:22.370 --> 08:23.310]  Hey, hey guys.
[08:23.450 --> 08:25.650]  Oh, it seems like it's on you to forget to mention it.
[08:25.850 --> 08:27.970]  Nick here, cutting in to let you know at the beginning of this VOD
[08:27.970 --> 08:30.930]  that Nick is the perspective you'll be watching this whole video.
[08:31.150 --> 08:31.470]  Thank you.
[08:40.640 --> 08:42.620]  Skip this, I don't want to hear about Bunko again.
[08:43.640 --> 08:44.160]  Thank you.
[08:44.680 --> 08:45.840]  All right, let's try pistols first.
[08:46.020 --> 08:49.360]  Do you think the team is New York, or do you think the player's name is New York?
[08:49.980 --> 08:50.700]  I'm Bunko.
[08:51.360 --> 08:53.440]  No, but my jersey, I got a jersey on.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.360]  Oh, it does say New York on it.
[08:55.540 --> 08:58.080]  Maybe in the alternate universe this takes place in,
[08:58.300 --> 09:00.060]  that's like the city is important.
[09:00.300 --> 09:00.940]  They put it on the back.
[09:01.840 --> 09:02.000]  All right.
[09:02.180 --> 09:03.120]  Dan, you hear me?
[09:03.540 --> 09:04.480]  Get after him, Bunko.
[09:06.560 --> 09:07.360]  We're going for it.
[09:07.380 --> 09:08.700]  Trying the subway to Inwood.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.720]  There does seem to be some advantage to stealth.
[09:11.820 --> 09:12.200]  Stealth.
[09:13.620 --> 09:14.820]  Watch that right side.
[09:16.220 --> 09:16.840]  Oh God.
[09:16.840 --> 09:17.420]  I'll go in there with you.
[09:17.560 --> 09:17.840]  Uh-oh.
[09:17.880 --> 09:18.240]  Oh shit.
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.660]  Well, stealth may have become not an option.
[09:22.800 --> 09:23.080]  We'll see.
[09:24.340 --> 09:25.060]  Okay, we're good.
[09:25.180 --> 09:25.500]  We got it.
[09:25.560 --> 09:26.020]  We're still okay.
[09:26.840 --> 09:27.020]  Yep.
[09:27.320 --> 09:27.780]  Got it.
[09:27.940 --> 09:28.200]  Anything in here?
[09:30.680 --> 09:31.120]  Good.
[09:32.160 --> 09:32.560]  Okay.
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.200]  Let's go, Bunko.
[09:34.320 --> 09:34.560]  Uh-oh.
[09:38.640 --> 09:40.320]  Is one of us Bunko?
[09:41.080 --> 09:42.060]  Somebody's named Bunko.
[09:43.580 --> 09:45.440]  That might be the helicopter crew.
[09:46.620 --> 09:48.140]  You think the helicopter's a Bunko?
[09:48.420 --> 09:49.560]  It could be a Bunko.
[09:50.080 --> 09:51.300]  Dude, I'm bipping these guys.
[09:51.480 --> 09:52.640]  I'm feeling good about the bips.
[09:52.820 --> 09:54.140]  Dude, the bips are working great.
[09:54.340 --> 09:54.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:54.780 --> 09:56.280]  I feel good about the bips in this game.
[09:57.120 --> 09:58.100]  I should swap my bips.
[09:58.320 --> 09:59.340]  There's some bippage in the next room.
[10:02.780 --> 10:04.360]  Got a heavy machine gun here.
[10:05.680 --> 10:06.780]  Doesn't sound very bippy.
[10:07.200 --> 10:09.860]  No, no, but we will use it if we need it.
[10:11.120 --> 10:12.540]  It's more glacky than bippy.
[10:12.700 --> 10:13.540]  It is glacky.
[10:13.900 --> 10:14.260]  I agree.
[10:15.460 --> 10:16.220]  Oh, watch your legs.
[10:16.300 --> 10:16.660]  Watch your legs.
[10:17.040 --> 10:17.640]  Oh, got it.
[10:19.480 --> 10:20.200]  Oh, dear.
[10:20.460 --> 10:21.740]  Okay, this is going pretty well.
[10:21.740 --> 10:22.580]  Watch that left side.
[10:23.920 --> 10:24.760]  Oh, oh, oh.
[10:26.720 --> 10:28.060]  I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.
[10:28.540 --> 10:28.860]  Thank you.
[10:30.560 --> 10:32.600]  I hear this is going pretty well so far.
[10:32.720 --> 10:33.700]  Immediately followed by that.
[10:33.720 --> 10:34.620]  I'm pretty impressed.
[10:36.240 --> 10:38.240]  There's a sniper rifle here if somebody wants it.
[10:38.840 --> 10:39.280]  Oh, I do.
[10:39.440 --> 10:39.780]  I ain't sniping.
[10:40.340 --> 10:41.800]  I just pinged it.
[10:42.720 --> 10:42.940]  Oh.
[10:43.100 --> 10:43.640]  Oh, you sure did.
[10:43.740 --> 10:44.180]  I'll go get it.
[10:44.320 --> 10:44.380]  Yeah.
[10:44.540 --> 10:45.300]  Unless Gavin wants it.
[10:45.480 --> 10:46.260]  Gavin, you're the sniper guy.
[10:46.260 --> 10:48.360]  All right, I'll be a snipey healer.
[10:49.020 --> 10:50.380]  That's a classic sniper move.
[10:51.200 --> 10:51.480]  Yeah.
[10:52.380 --> 10:53.040]  Oh, wow.
[10:53.840 --> 10:55.420]  Okay, you're good.
[10:55.600 --> 10:56.140]  Andrew, you got it.
[10:56.200 --> 10:57.000]  You got these guys, right?
[10:57.220 --> 10:57.680]  I'm bippin'.
[10:57.680 --> 10:58.300]  I'm bippin'.
[10:58.300 --> 10:58.520]  Okay.
[10:58.880 --> 11:06.100]  All right, we got a bunch of grenades, weapons, ammo.
[11:06.380 --> 11:07.020]  Refill grenades.
[11:07.280 --> 11:08.180]  Oh, refill ammo.
[11:09.280 --> 11:10.340]  I'm gonna call this elevator.
[11:11.420 --> 11:12.620]  I bet there's guys inside of it.
[11:13.100 --> 11:14.220]  Does anyone need healing?
[11:14.220 --> 11:14.460]  Probably.
[11:15.500 --> 11:16.220]  So far, so good.
[11:16.460 --> 11:16.960]  Uh, no.
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.460]  I could use a little bit of healies.
[11:19.880 --> 11:20.660]  Hey, guys, you'll never believe it.
[11:20.700 --> 11:21.320]  Oh, my God.
[11:21.340 --> 11:22.080]  Oh, no.
[11:22.280 --> 11:22.560]  No.
[11:25.660 --> 11:26.820]  Do we have to kill this guy?
[11:26.920 --> 11:27.100]  Do you think...
[11:29.280 --> 11:29.860]  Okay, I got him.
[11:29.860 --> 11:30.260]  I got him.
[11:30.520 --> 11:30.780]  Okay.
[11:30.880 --> 11:31.160]  Okay.
[11:31.360 --> 11:32.000]  Someone threw grenades.
[11:32.780 --> 11:33.900]  I had heavy ammo.
[11:34.020 --> 11:34.540]  Oh, we should...
[11:35.160 --> 11:35.340]  Go.
[11:35.440 --> 11:35.600]  Get in.
[11:35.620 --> 11:35.880]  Go now.
[11:35.880 --> 11:36.220]  Go now.
[11:36.320 --> 11:36.580]  Go now.
[11:36.580 --> 11:36.720]  Get in the elevator.
[11:36.880 --> 11:37.120]  Get in.
[11:37.140 --> 11:37.580]  Get in the elevator.
[11:39.240 --> 11:40.520]  That was pretty cool.
[11:44.440 --> 11:44.760]  Holy...
[11:44.760 --> 11:45.340]  Oh, thanks, Gavin.
[11:46.960 --> 11:47.480]  Bend over.
[11:50.040 --> 11:51.620]  Why did I black out when you did that?
[11:54.020 --> 11:54.860]  Okay, what do we got?
[11:55.200 --> 11:56.800]  Okay, we gotta reach down here, I guess.
[11:59.480 --> 12:00.540]  Oh, my God.
[12:00.600 --> 12:01.060]  Oh, it's a bunker.
[12:01.220 --> 12:01.580]  What do you see?
[12:01.720 --> 12:02.360]  Oh, there's a lot.
[12:02.480 --> 12:03.480]  Oh, wow, look at the horde.
[12:05.760 --> 12:07.160]  Oh, my God, look down.
[12:07.600 --> 12:07.800]  Holy shit.
[12:07.800 --> 12:08.340]  Look down.
[12:09.400 --> 12:10.500]  Is this exactly the same thing?
[12:10.500 --> 12:12.780]  Is this exactly the level from the first stage in Left 4 Dead 2?
[12:12.800 --> 12:13.860]  Do we have to fuel the car?
[12:17.120 --> 12:19.220]  Wow, that's crazy.
[12:19.340 --> 12:20.100]  Oh, I don't like that.
[12:22.440 --> 12:23.520]  Take this MGL heavy.
[12:24.160 --> 12:25.320]  Clear all zombies.
[12:25.340 --> 12:26.020]  Who's got grenades?
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.200]  Me, we also have this...
[12:28.200 --> 12:29.380]  There's equipment up here.
[12:30.980 --> 12:32.740]  Ooh, there's a payload rifle.
[12:33.040 --> 12:34.420]  Yeah, dude, Nick, take that.
[12:34.960 --> 12:35.800]  Thank you.
[12:38.160 --> 12:38.600]  Damn.
[12:38.920 --> 12:40.480]  Let's see how they react to a single bit.
[12:41.020 --> 12:42.140]  Oh, you're crazy.
[12:44.300 --> 12:45.340]  Oh, I dropped one.
[12:46.980 --> 12:48.680]  Can we just do that 9,000 times?
[12:49.220 --> 12:50.380]  Ah, oh, no.
[12:51.240 --> 12:52.060]  They've noticed.
[12:52.620 --> 12:54.120]  Gavin, behind you!
[12:54.380 --> 12:55.220]  Behind you!
[13:01.030 --> 13:02.350]  Where's your arm gone, son?
[13:02.390 --> 13:03.770]  There's an SMG over here.
[13:05.710 --> 13:06.710]  I'll mark it.
[13:08.570 --> 13:09.870]  Oh, there's a heavy machine gun.
[13:09.990 --> 13:10.510]  All right, we have a...
[13:10.510 --> 13:12.670]  It looks like if you can...
[13:12.670 --> 13:13.230]  To the right!
[13:13.350 --> 13:13.950]  To the right!
[13:13.950 --> 13:17.430]  It looks like if you can keep them from climbing...
[13:17.430 --> 13:18.990]  Oh, Nick, behind you.
[13:19.230 --> 13:19.890]  Yeah, thank you.
[13:20.830 --> 13:24.650]  Looks like if you can keep them from climbing, they won't get up so quickly.
[13:25.050 --> 13:26.030]  Like, see how, like, they're making...
[13:27.330 --> 13:28.050]  Got it.
[13:28.350 --> 13:29.070]  We have a...
[13:29.070 --> 13:29.270]  What you got?
[13:30.490 --> 13:31.210]  Refill frags.
[13:31.370 --> 13:32.550]  Oh, that sounds like a heavy.
[13:32.810 --> 13:33.170]  Charger!
[13:33.330 --> 13:33.810]  Right there!
[13:33.950 --> 13:34.070]  Where?
[13:34.250 --> 13:35.730]  Right across the way, look out here, step back.
[13:39.390 --> 13:40.150]  There's a screamer.
[13:40.530 --> 13:40.930]  Oh, shit.
[13:41.470 --> 13:42.590]  Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[13:42.670 --> 13:42.970]  Charger's down.
[13:43.510 --> 13:45.310]  No, he's back up, he's back up, he's back up!
[13:45.830 --> 13:47.490]  Did he say there's a gas bag?
[13:48.350 --> 13:49.070]  Oh, shit.
[13:49.310 --> 13:50.010]  Oh, shit.
[13:50.690 --> 13:52.670]  How the hell do I get to the other gun that I have?
[13:54.150 --> 13:54.810]  Oh, I see.
[13:54.850 --> 13:55.110]  Oh, shit.
[13:55.730 --> 13:56.950]  Oh, there's so many of them.
[13:57.290 --> 13:58.230]  Oh, balls!
[14:00.450 --> 14:00.810]  Grenade!
[14:00.930 --> 14:01.570]  Someone's screaming.
[14:03.070 --> 14:03.790]  Oh, Andrew!
[14:04.930 --> 14:05.290]  Nick!
[14:05.570 --> 14:06.430]  I got him, I got him, I got him.
[14:06.510 --> 14:07.750]  Right bumpers melee attack.
[14:07.830 --> 14:08.370]  I don't know if you...
[14:09.150 --> 14:09.710]  I just noticed.
[14:10.930 --> 14:12.910]  We got knives and stuff, or at least I do.
[14:13.610 --> 14:15.230]  I just stim-pistoled someone.
[14:15.410 --> 14:16.090]  Oh, shit, hello.
[14:16.510 --> 14:17.290]  Okay, we're good, we're good.
[14:17.330 --> 14:18.630]  We just gotta take out a couple of these guys and we're good.
[14:18.650 --> 14:19.390]  To the right, to the right, to the right!
[14:19.890 --> 14:20.410]  How do you melee?
[14:20.410 --> 14:22.230]  We're all right, they're almost done, they're almost done.
[14:23.050 --> 14:23.610]  Right bumper?
[14:24.310 --> 14:25.010]  Right bumpers melee?
[14:25.450 --> 14:25.630]  Yeah.
[14:26.410 --> 14:28.770]  It's a weird place to have melee, but that's where it is.
[14:29.130 --> 14:30.010]  Yeah, I agree.
[14:30.550 --> 14:32.090]  What is this guy?
[14:32.490 --> 14:34.230]  Oh, Gavin!
[14:34.470 --> 14:35.750]  Gavin, call it out, man.
[14:37.370 --> 14:38.190]  Isn't that what I was doing?
[14:38.950 --> 14:39.970]  I just heard, oh, shit.
[14:39.970 --> 14:41.150]  Oh, I guess it is.
[14:41.150 --> 14:41.870]  Yeah, all right, fair.
[14:42.710 --> 14:43.430]  Oh, shit.
[14:44.050 --> 14:45.010]  Hang on, I gotta heal.
[14:45.870 --> 14:46.610]  I can heal you.
[14:46.850 --> 14:47.450]  Oh, shit, hang on.
[14:47.610 --> 14:48.430]  Charger coming up on the right!
[14:48.510 --> 14:49.350]  I'm going to the interact.
[14:49.770 --> 14:50.810]  I'm just going to the interact.
[14:51.190 --> 14:51.910]  He's over here.
[14:54.850 --> 14:55.870]  I don't have a...
[14:55.870 --> 14:56.510]  Oh, applied back.
[14:57.190 --> 14:58.350]  This is to me or someone else?
[14:58.410 --> 14:58.730]  Got him.
[14:58.930 --> 14:59.070]  Ow.
[14:59.190 --> 14:59.510]  Got him.
[14:59.650 --> 15:00.270]  Oh, nice!
[15:00.410 --> 15:00.550]  Yeah.
[15:00.950 --> 15:01.590]  Was I shooting you?
[15:01.730 --> 15:02.230]  I had a heavy.
[15:03.110 --> 15:03.850]  I need, uh...
[15:04.290 --> 15:05.030]  I need health.
[15:05.910 --> 15:06.330]  If, uh...
[15:06.330 --> 15:07.250]  I can do this.
[15:07.570 --> 15:07.890]  I can...
[15:07.890 --> 15:08.850]  I'm applying bandages.
[15:09.490 --> 15:10.150]  What was that?
[15:10.350 --> 15:11.090]  Did you shoot me with a gun?
[15:11.350 --> 15:12.790]  I stim-pistoled you.
[15:12.890 --> 15:13.690]  What the fuck?
[15:13.690 --> 15:15.110]  How did you access your bandages, Eric?
[15:16.150 --> 15:16.850]  That was weird.
[15:18.050 --> 15:18.750]  Oh, thank you.
[15:19.930 --> 15:20.630]  I don't know if that lost.
[15:21.050 --> 15:21.670]  Is there, like, a heal...
[15:21.670 --> 15:22.090]  Oh, God.
[15:22.330 --> 15:22.910]  What is this?
[15:23.130 --> 15:24.230]  He's a bomb guy!
[15:25.950 --> 15:26.510]  Oh, shit!
[15:26.850 --> 15:27.430]  Watch out, fellas!
[15:27.730 --> 15:28.550]  Look out, Gavin, look out!
[15:29.770 --> 15:30.710]  And then he's just going to go.
[15:30.890 --> 15:31.850]  I think they're going to keep coming.
[15:32.470 --> 15:33.250]  Okay, we got to move down.
[15:33.330 --> 15:33.850]  Oh, we got to keep moving.
[15:33.850 --> 15:34.550]  Nick, look out behind you.
[15:34.710 --> 15:35.330]  There you go, you're good.
[15:35.390 --> 15:35.650]  Thank you.
[15:36.310 --> 15:36.830]  What is this?
[15:36.870 --> 15:37.770]  I'll cover you guys, come on.
[15:38.210 --> 15:39.450]  What is that guy?
[15:39.850 --> 15:40.530]  Why won't he die?
[15:41.590 --> 15:42.850]  I'm... I need disinfecting.
[15:43.850 --> 15:44.690]  All right, we got to go.
[15:44.810 --> 15:45.770]  I think we got to move down.
[15:46.210 --> 15:46.590]  I'm with you, Gavin.
[15:46.590 --> 15:46.930]  Yeah, let's go.
[15:47.410 --> 15:47.910]  Over here.
[15:48.110 --> 15:48.970]  Med kit down here.
[15:49.510 --> 15:49.750]  Cool.
[15:50.830 --> 15:52.010]  Oh, crazy shit.
[15:52.150 --> 15:52.810]  Hell yeah.
[15:54.110 --> 15:54.590]  Now we're talking.
[15:55.070 --> 15:56.130]  Stationary machine gun.
[15:58.650 --> 15:59.010]  Ooh.
[16:01.490 --> 16:01.990]  Got him.
[16:02.050 --> 16:03.270]  I'm deploying a machine gun.
[16:04.090 --> 16:05.210]  Okay, that's how you do it.
[16:05.250 --> 16:06.590]  Somebody want to come down here and use it?
[16:06.590 --> 16:06.690]  Yeah.
[16:08.370 --> 16:09.270]  We'll be there in a sec.
[16:09.410 --> 16:10.470]  Refilling frag grenades.
[16:15.230 --> 16:17.010]  This fucking thing still?
[16:17.650 --> 16:18.990]  Ow, what the hell was that?
[16:19.130 --> 16:19.510]  What thing?
[16:19.890 --> 16:21.170]  What is this?
[16:21.950 --> 16:22.950]  Oh, did you get the goo?
[16:24.630 --> 16:26.150]  Nick, what... why won't this thing die?
[16:27.570 --> 16:28.770]  Oh, I didn't know it was here.
[16:30.690 --> 16:32.570]  Gavin just shot me so many times.
[16:32.650 --> 16:33.290]  Ooh, there's...
[16:33.290 --> 16:35.210]  Guys, there's barbed wire over here that we can snag.
[16:35.470 --> 16:35.870]  Gavin shot me so much.
[16:35.870 --> 16:37.070]  We got a swarm incoming, apparently.
[16:38.910 --> 16:39.610]  So much.
[16:40.190 --> 16:41.030]  Is that friendly fire?
[16:41.770 --> 16:42.090]  Yes!
[16:42.810 --> 16:44.270]  There's a rocket launcher down here.
[16:44.790 --> 16:45.650]  Or up here, I guess.
[16:46.370 --> 16:47.770]  Oh, I can deploy barbed wire.
[16:47.950 --> 16:48.150]  Deploying barbed wire.
[16:48.590 --> 16:48.730]  Cool.
[16:48.850 --> 16:49.650]  I'll do it on the other side.
[16:50.290 --> 16:51.090]  I have some horde, are we?
[16:51.410 --> 16:53.990]  Yeah, I think there's about to be a really nasty horde here.
[16:54.530 --> 16:55.850]  Shall I help on this bad boy?
[16:56.090 --> 16:57.630]  Yeah, I'm gonna jump on this one, too.
[16:58.190 --> 16:59.890]  Does anyone have a med kit?
[17:01.770 --> 17:03.330]  There was some at the top of the stairs here.
[17:03.510 --> 17:05.650]  Oh, marazzle dazzle with some gifted subs.
[17:05.850 --> 17:06.670]  Guys, thank you.
[17:06.670 --> 17:06.870]  Oh, thank you.
[17:07.110 --> 17:07.370]  That was a rocket launcher.
[17:07.370 --> 17:08.330]  Check this out.
[17:09.130 --> 17:10.570]  This is refill ammo.
[17:10.790 --> 17:11.690]  Oh, that's a...
[17:11.690 --> 17:13.430]  Uh, charger, charger, charger, charger.
[17:13.570 --> 17:14.870]  Oh, I guess they ran out.
[17:15.050 --> 17:16.190]  Okay, so there aren't any.
[17:16.390 --> 17:18.170]  We got 10 seconds for defenses.
[17:18.470 --> 17:19.310]  Well, we got a charger.
[17:20.210 --> 17:20.610]  Okay.
[17:21.530 --> 17:23.350]  Oh, Eric is slashing them.
[17:23.550 --> 17:24.030]  I'm down.
[17:25.770 --> 17:27.310]  Eric was slashing them.
[17:27.930 --> 17:28.750]  If anyone can help me out.
[17:28.870 --> 17:29.170]  I'm getting you.
[17:29.370 --> 17:30.870]  All three of you at once, that works, too.
[17:31.590 --> 17:31.790]  Yeah.
[17:32.690 --> 17:33.210]  Thank you.
[17:33.390 --> 17:35.150]  Let me shoot you with the health gun.
[17:35.190 --> 17:35.790]  Yeah, hit me with it.
[17:36.730 --> 17:37.730]  Fellas, over here.
[17:37.830 --> 17:38.170]  RPG.
[17:38.970 --> 17:40.030]  Uh, I'll take that.
[17:40.770 --> 17:41.610]  I have a rocket launcher.
[17:42.210 --> 17:43.070]  Oh, here they come.
[17:43.490 --> 17:43.950]  Front door.
[17:44.050 --> 17:44.850]  Oh, uh.
[17:46.290 --> 17:47.610]  Front freaking door, son.
[17:47.870 --> 17:48.450]  Front, front, front, front.
[17:50.270 --> 17:51.210]  Okay, I see them.
[17:51.210 --> 17:52.750]  Okay, I'm gonna use this thing.
[17:52.850 --> 17:53.110]  Fuck it.
[17:53.410 --> 17:56.070]  You think I need to wait until they're in to fire this rocket?
[17:58.810 --> 17:59.290]  They're in.
[17:59.410 --> 17:59.770]  What was that?
[17:59.770 --> 18:00.070]  They're in.
[18:00.810 --> 18:01.330]  They're in.
[18:01.490 --> 18:02.110]  Oh, they're in.
[18:02.210 --> 18:04.270]  Oh, this thing has a very finite amount of bullets.
[18:04.810 --> 18:04.970]  Whoa.
[18:04.970 --> 18:05.410]  Oh, does it?
[18:05.790 --> 18:06.330]  Yeah.
[18:06.330 --> 18:07.450]  Probably should save it.
[18:07.910 --> 18:08.050]  It's out.
[18:11.850 --> 18:13.190]  Oh no, they're inside!
[18:13.690 --> 18:14.730]  Oh, shit!
[18:15.690 --> 18:16.190]  Oh, god!
[18:16.190 --> 18:17.290]  It's another charge hole!
[18:18.510 --> 18:22.850]  How do you use your heavy?
[18:23.710 --> 18:25.810]  You hold Y to equip it.
[18:26.290 --> 18:29.690]  Oh, I'm down.
[18:30.390 --> 18:31.670]  Oh, something blew me up!
[18:31.870 --> 18:32.330]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[18:32.590 --> 18:32.890]  I'm down.
[18:33.150 --> 18:33.630]  Oh, no!
[18:33.950 --> 18:34.390]  I forgot.
[18:34.570 --> 18:35.030]  Friendly fire.
[18:35.690 --> 18:36.010]  Whoopsie.
[18:36.350 --> 18:36.790]  That was you?
[18:37.190 --> 18:39.670]  It seems like the thing that got us the most was the friendly fire.
[18:40.310 --> 18:41.110]  Yeah, yeah, a little bit.
[18:41.190 --> 18:41.610]  I got Erica.
[18:42.090 --> 18:42.450]  Thank you.
[18:42.510 --> 18:42.710]  I'm coming for Andrew.
[18:42.710 --> 18:43.410]  I'm on the elevator.
[18:43.710 --> 18:44.210]  Or escalator.
[18:44.410 --> 18:44.530]  I'm trying.
[18:44.690 --> 18:45.410]  I'm watching your back.
[18:45.510 --> 18:45.890]  I'm watching your back.
[18:45.890 --> 18:46.170]  Thank you.
[18:46.310 --> 18:46.830]  Fuck you.
[18:46.950 --> 18:47.930]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[18:48.190 --> 18:48.650]  There's something.
[18:48.970 --> 18:49.650]  On the escalator.
[18:49.710 --> 18:50.630]  Okay, I'm coming to you.
[18:51.350 --> 18:52.490]  Get off of the...
[18:52.490 --> 18:53.450]  Oh, fuck.
[18:54.410 --> 18:56.550]  I don't think we put defenses in the right place.
[18:56.710 --> 18:57.210]  I agree.
[18:59.010 --> 18:59.650]  Fuck, fuck.
[19:00.370 --> 19:01.330]  Oh, are you gonna save me?
[19:02.370 --> 19:04.110]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[19:04.110 --> 19:04.610]  Thank you!
[19:05.060 --> 19:05.830]  I'm swarmed.
[19:05.930 --> 19:06.470]  You can't beat the hell out of me.
[19:06.490 --> 19:06.950]  I'm dead.
[19:07.570 --> 19:08.830]  I just became a zomba.
[19:10.330 --> 19:11.670]  What the fuck?
[19:12.970 --> 19:13.650]  Oh, God.
[19:16.150 --> 19:18.610]  All right, we're now watching Andrew's perspective.
[19:19.550 --> 19:21.090]  Oh, down he goes.
[19:23.330 --> 19:24.610]  I get killed by a hunter.
[19:25.390 --> 19:26.490]  Now we're watching Gavin.
[19:26.690 --> 19:26.930]  Shit.
[19:28.950 --> 19:30.250]  Can I use this on you?
[19:31.810 --> 19:33.270]  I think that's a no.
[19:34.610 --> 19:35.730]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[19:40.870 --> 19:42.810]  So I think we need to move quick.
[19:43.230 --> 19:47.270]  Maybe be mindful of ammo and shooting each other is the takeaway from that round.
[19:47.490 --> 19:48.730]  Be mindful of shooting each other.
[19:48.850 --> 19:49.590]  Well, I mean, if you insist.
[19:49.710 --> 19:52.050]  I think, I think half my health was probably gone.
[19:52.250 --> 19:52.330]  So.
[19:52.910 --> 19:54.510]  I got blown senseless.
[19:55.070 --> 19:55.270]  Sorry.
[19:57.410 --> 19:58.950]  Gotta get your mind out of the smut.
[20:02.650 --> 20:03.050]  Skip.
[20:03.810 --> 20:04.610]  Skip all.
[20:05.630 --> 20:06.110]  Oh, yeah, skip.
[20:06.130 --> 20:06.590]  Ready it up.
[20:09.050 --> 20:10.870]  I'm changing my character, damn you.
[20:11.950 --> 20:16.210]  It does sort of feel like the Left 4 Dead thing where we can just move through things when
[20:16.680 --> 20:17.410]  we can't.
[20:17.470 --> 20:20.230]  Like if we wait, enemies will just keep showing up.
[20:20.810 --> 20:20.890]  Right.
[20:22.770 --> 20:26.290]  But don't hold up too long until the defense areas.
[20:26.510 --> 20:26.790]  Yeah.
[20:27.430 --> 20:30.750]  I think I need to use my medicine gun more.
[20:31.410 --> 20:32.890]  Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
[20:34.810 --> 20:36.090]  Will you shoot me with a Healy bullet?
[20:37.610 --> 20:38.330]  Healy squealy.
[20:39.410 --> 20:42.650]  I think this is what happens when we play on hard and we've never played this game before.
[20:43.650 --> 20:45.690]  Yeah, this is my POV, by the way.
[20:57.130 --> 20:58.350]  God damn it, Bunko.
[21:00.130 --> 21:01.830]  We know your life story, damn it.
[21:02.310 --> 21:04.590]  All right, put on your put on your silenced weapons.
[21:05.450 --> 21:05.590]  Yeah.
[21:06.030 --> 21:07.670]  Are we missing getting shit up here?
[21:08.010 --> 21:08.450]  I don't know.
[21:08.450 --> 21:09.730]  I don't think so.
[21:13.330 --> 21:15.570]  I think Bunko would tell us if that was the case.
[21:15.890 --> 21:16.470]  You hear me?
[21:16.650 --> 21:17.790]  I don't know. He screamed a lot.
[21:19.190 --> 21:19.890]  Thanks, guys.
[21:20.070 --> 21:20.750]  We're going for it.
[21:20.890 --> 21:21.950]  Trying the subway to Inwood.
[21:22.390 --> 21:22.510]  Bip.
[21:22.870 --> 21:25.670]  That was Bip-tastic.
[21:25.930 --> 21:26.810]  That was very good Bips.
[21:27.150 --> 21:27.790]  Nice job.
[21:27.970 --> 21:28.930]  Oh, frag grenades.
[21:30.390 --> 21:31.370]  Oh, that's a guy.
[21:31.790 --> 21:32.190]  Nice.
[21:33.190 --> 21:33.890]  Oh, where'd he come from?
[21:34.390 --> 21:34.770]  Ground.
[21:39.100 --> 21:42.260]  Something's stalking us.
[21:45.240 --> 21:45.760]  Oops.
[21:46.160 --> 21:46.660]  Okay.
[21:46.940 --> 21:48.120]  Oh, shit.
[21:49.300 --> 21:49.820]  Okay.
[21:51.740 --> 21:53.080]  Guys, the Creeper's down.
[21:53.660 --> 21:54.600]  I took down the Creeper.
[21:54.600 --> 21:55.020]  Is that what this thing is?
[21:56.460 --> 21:56.900]  Is that Hunter?
[21:57.040 --> 21:57.440]  Is this the Creeper?
[21:57.540 --> 21:57.880]  I don't know.
[21:58.560 --> 21:59.160]  I think so.
[21:59.160 --> 21:59.400]  I believe it is, yeah.
[22:02.200 --> 22:03.420]  What's the charger called?
[22:04.460 --> 22:04.980]  Charger.
[22:05.680 --> 22:06.160]  Bloater.
[22:06.440 --> 22:06.500]  Bloater.
[22:07.920 --> 22:09.320]  Hey, man, where are those pills?
[22:12.560 --> 22:13.320]  All right.
[22:13.460 --> 22:14.620]  Oh, you're still alive.
[22:15.360 --> 22:16.000]  Not anymore.
[22:16.700 --> 22:16.960]  Nope.
[22:17.720 --> 22:18.420]  Uh-oh, guys.
[22:18.500 --> 22:19.180]  Take out that Screamer.
[22:19.440 --> 22:19.640]  Screamer.
[22:21.040 --> 22:21.700]  Oh, missed.
[22:21.700 --> 22:22.560]  Yo, shut up!
[22:27.980 --> 22:28.360]  Bip.
[22:28.760 --> 22:29.140]  Bip.
[22:30.040 --> 22:30.420]  Bip.
[22:30.540 --> 22:30.720]  Bip.
[22:30.800 --> 22:31.000]  Silence.
[22:31.160 --> 22:31.400]  Bip.
[22:31.560 --> 22:32.100]  Where's your arm?
[22:34.220 --> 22:36.300]  Are they going to make this movie into a trilogy or something?
[22:36.520 --> 22:37.360]  I think so, yeah.
[22:37.460 --> 22:38.880]  Yeah, and then I think nobody saw it.
[22:40.100 --> 22:42.080]  Well, to be fair, it was completely different from the book.
[22:43.120 --> 22:46.800]  I remember there's a scene where someone, like, runs onto a chopper or something,
[22:46.920 --> 22:49.320]  and then he falls and shoots himself in the face by accident.
[22:49.640 --> 22:50.500]  Oh, that's cool.
[22:50.680 --> 22:50.920]  He was the doctor.
[22:51.320 --> 22:52.000]  That's so cool.
[22:52.280 --> 22:52.560]  He was the doctor.
[22:52.960 --> 22:53.320]  That's...
[22:53.320 --> 22:55.600]  That makes me want to see the movie.
[22:56.860 --> 22:59.300]  He was going to synthesize something, and he got scared.
[22:59.400 --> 23:02.060]  They all ran back on the plane, and as he fell, he shot himself in the head.
[23:02.180 --> 23:02.740]  Oh my god.
[23:04.600 --> 23:06.740]  That's kind of all I remember from that film, I think.
[23:07.300 --> 23:08.120]  It was quite shocking.
[23:11.580 --> 23:12.780]  It was pretty funny.
[23:13.380 --> 23:14.140]  Okay, we're all clear.
[23:14.780 --> 23:15.240]  Get bips.
[23:16.800 --> 23:19.520]  I feel like a shotgun is a terrible weapon for this.
[23:20.100 --> 23:20.220]  Yeah.
[23:21.460 --> 23:22.020]  Let's get your ammo.
[23:22.040 --> 23:24.120]  I think now I'm going to replace my bip with a...
[23:26.120 --> 23:27.080]  Something a little heavier.
[23:27.780 --> 23:28.080]  Yeah.
[23:28.160 --> 23:28.760]  Oh, that's not what we want.
[23:28.820 --> 23:29.740]  I missed my sniper.
[23:29.840 --> 23:30.540]  That thing was great.
[23:31.200 --> 23:31.500]  Pretty good.
[23:31.500 --> 23:32.720]  Oh, they didn't give it to us this time.
[23:32.720 --> 23:33.880]  Open the door.
[23:34.000 --> 23:34.860]  Yeah, let's do it.
[23:34.900 --> 23:37.260]  And then kill these guys, and let's get inside real quick.
[23:37.680 --> 23:38.160]  Yeah.
[23:41.370 --> 23:42.250]  You guys got it.
[23:44.430 --> 23:45.330]  Okay, get inside.
[23:45.630 --> 23:45.870]  Easy.
[23:46.110 --> 23:47.130]  Assemble, Avengers.
[23:49.110 --> 23:49.590]  Nice.
[23:53.950 --> 23:55.650]  I'm Hawkeye, the useful one.
[23:57.650 --> 23:58.130]  Archery.
[23:59.750 --> 24:02.210]  That's my whole thing, for some reason.
[24:03.030 --> 24:04.030]  Hey, you didn't turn to dust.
[24:05.110 --> 24:09.110]  Okay, let's have a look around, and then let's make our move, I suppose.
[24:09.950 --> 24:11.090]  A lot of fucking guys.
[24:11.790 --> 24:13.330]  All right, how are we getting the jump on these?
[24:13.470 --> 24:14.390]  Grenades, if anybody needs one.
[24:14.650 --> 24:15.930]  Okay, I got this heavy machine gun.
[24:16.970 --> 24:17.790]  Anything back here?
[24:19.330 --> 24:19.970]  What is this?
[24:19.990 --> 24:20.430]  Bandage kit.
[24:20.590 --> 24:21.190]  Oh, damn!
[24:21.350 --> 24:23.450]  There's a rocket launcher here.
[24:24.750 --> 24:26.210]  If anyone wants to grab a heavy, right here.
[24:26.410 --> 24:27.430]  Should we start with that?
[24:28.110 --> 24:28.690]  Start with what?
[24:29.410 --> 24:30.130]  The rocket launcher.
[24:31.050 --> 24:32.190]  I don't think so.
[24:32.250 --> 24:33.210]  I think it's probably good to hang on.
[24:33.210 --> 24:35.670]  Well, maybe using it probably pretty early is good.
[24:36.470 --> 24:37.950]  It's the one you have to hold Y on.
[24:38.190 --> 24:38.350]  Yeah.
[24:38.510 --> 24:39.150]  To equip.
[24:39.830 --> 24:42.850]  Okay, well, we have to get through this part, too, so...
[24:42.850 --> 24:43.290]  Of course.
[24:43.690 --> 24:44.150]  Be mindful.
[24:46.930 --> 24:47.850]  The living force.
[24:48.730 --> 24:49.310]  All right, boys.
[24:49.990 --> 24:50.650]  You ready?
[24:50.970 --> 24:51.390]  Oh, they're in.
[24:51.570 --> 24:51.790]  They're up.
[24:52.510 --> 24:52.630]  Yep.
[24:53.690 --> 24:54.110]  I gotcha.
[24:54.970 --> 24:55.830]  You guys all here?
[24:56.330 --> 24:56.710]  Yep.
[24:57.050 --> 24:57.210]  Yeah.
[24:57.490 --> 24:58.310]  Okay, let's do it.
[24:58.750 --> 25:00.110]  Let's get this party started, baby.
[25:01.430 --> 25:01.870]  Ha!
[25:03.270 --> 25:03.670]  Shit.
[25:05.170 --> 25:06.570]  Well, that'll do it.
[25:06.990 --> 25:07.730]  Here they come.
[25:10.010 --> 25:10.410]  Nice.
[25:10.670 --> 25:11.550]  Nice grenade.
[25:13.130 --> 25:14.270]  Oh, they're up here.
[25:14.610 --> 25:15.670]  Forgot they got up here.
[25:17.770 --> 25:18.550]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[25:18.550 --> 25:19.430]  Oh my God.
[25:19.590 --> 25:20.250]  How do you roll?
[25:20.790 --> 25:21.390]  I don't know.
[25:21.490 --> 25:23.110]  There needs to be an actual button.
[25:23.910 --> 25:25.090]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, I'm down.
[25:25.730 --> 25:26.170]  Are you?
[25:26.330 --> 25:26.590]  Shit.
[25:26.590 --> 25:27.070]  Oh, shit.
[25:27.150 --> 25:27.530]  So am I.
[25:27.730 --> 25:28.330]  Oh, guys.
[25:29.830 --> 25:30.790]  Yeah, things are bad.
[25:30.970 --> 25:31.550]  Guys, please.
[25:32.770 --> 25:32.930]  Ow.
[25:32.930 --> 25:33.770]  I'm down.
[25:34.070 --> 25:35.950]  Kevin's just swinging with his knife.
[25:36.090 --> 25:37.090]  All right, I'll run over and help them up.
[25:37.190 --> 25:37.430]  Sheddy.
[25:37.910 --> 25:40.250]  Behind you, behind you, stinky chem guy.
[25:40.430 --> 25:41.670]  We gotta get you guys up.
[25:42.710 --> 25:43.830]  I got the chem guy.
[25:45.490 --> 25:50.650]  Okay, so for this next one, we'll put it on normal because I want to see more of this game.
[25:50.650 --> 25:51.750]  The stick fell off.
[25:52.170 --> 25:52.750]  Okay, yep.
[25:53.410 --> 25:55.590]  Yeah, we'll put it on normal because I want to see more of this game.
[25:55.630 --> 25:55.950]  We're going to normal.
[25:56.470 --> 25:56.630]  Okay.
[25:56.990 --> 26:01.030]  I don't want to see this level again, only this far.
[26:01.850 --> 26:02.210]  Oh, yeah.
[26:07.110 --> 26:08.550]  I'm having a real ammo problem.
[26:08.730 --> 26:10.710]  I feel like all the heavies last like 10 seconds.
[26:10.870 --> 26:15.250]  Oh, the heavies are meant to be used, I think, so sparingly or like...
[26:15.250 --> 26:15.870]  Yep, so sparing.
[26:15.950 --> 26:17.270]  Yeah, like crazy mode.
[26:17.510 --> 26:18.210]  Like, oh, wow.
[26:18.290 --> 26:19.570]  Like, I have to use this right now.
[26:20.130 --> 26:24.530]  Well, we're going normal.
[26:25.330 --> 26:26.370]  Oh, you can edit classes.
[26:26.970 --> 26:29.050]  I have insufficient funds for impact grenades.
[26:29.430 --> 26:30.250]  Okay, whatever.
[26:30.890 --> 26:31.230]  Great.
[26:31.370 --> 26:31.910]  I have funds.
[26:32.490 --> 26:34.070]  Dabadoon says, whose gameplay are we watching?
[26:34.550 --> 26:35.310]  I think it's Geoff's.
[26:36.590 --> 26:36.990]  Yeah.
[26:37.450 --> 26:37.850]  Geoff?
[26:38.850 --> 26:40.350]  Someone said that Geoff was quiet.
[26:43.430 --> 26:44.930]  Ah, my favorite running bit.
[26:46.890 --> 26:49.910]  Cut to Geoff's gameplay and it's just him eating a hot dog right now.
[26:50.450 --> 26:51.810]  There's no way he's not.
[26:52.290 --> 26:55.550]  Like, by the end of this weekend, there will be a plus two on his board.
[26:55.750 --> 26:56.130]  No doubt.
[26:56.210 --> 26:59.830]  We should get some GoPro on the head footage of Geoff eating a hot dog.
[27:00.070 --> 27:01.870]  Oh, who wants to watch that?
[27:01.990 --> 27:03.050]  Oh, that's vile.
[27:03.650 --> 27:05.030]  Everyone here wants to watch that.
[27:05.030 --> 27:06.130]  I want to see it.
[27:06.210 --> 27:06.410]  What?
[27:06.690 --> 27:07.350]  I want to see his technique.
[27:07.350 --> 27:07.950]  I want to watch that.
[27:08.430 --> 27:08.650]  Yeah.
[27:09.450 --> 27:09.770]  Yuck.
[27:13.880 --> 27:14.740]  I'm messing up.
[27:14.920 --> 27:17.700]  I keep going with the Costco hot dog and it's so big that you can't get more than one.
[27:17.700 --> 27:18.360]  It's too big.
[27:18.680 --> 27:19.140]  It's too big.
[27:19.140 --> 27:19.640]  It's too big.
[27:19.700 --> 27:20.900]  Yeah, you can't get more than one.
[27:21.380 --> 27:21.840]  You hear me?
[27:22.040 --> 27:25.100]  I'm going to let them fight through the door instead of opening it.
[27:25.100 --> 27:25.440]  No way.
[27:25.760 --> 27:26.460]  Bip them while they're at the door.
[27:26.940 --> 27:27.760]  So I'm bipping them.
[27:29.160 --> 27:30.920]  I think bip is such a good strategy.
[27:31.220 --> 27:31.660]  It's crazy.
[27:31.840 --> 27:32.820]  I wouldn't have thought to bip.
[27:32.940 --> 27:34.620]  I would just go like, oh, I'm just going to fight these guys.
[27:36.680 --> 27:38.060]  The bip is like such a move.
[27:39.400 --> 27:40.620]  Oh, what's that?
[27:41.020 --> 27:42.520]  You got a guy who came in there.
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.600]  Something sounded heavy, but I think we're good.
[27:45.640 --> 27:47.640]  What's the best bipping gun in video games?
[27:49.580 --> 27:51.700]  I mean, it's the silenced pistol, right?
[27:51.880 --> 27:53.400]  I mean, silenced pistol has to be it.
[27:53.500 --> 27:54.520]  Silenced pistol in which game?
[27:54.700 --> 27:55.140]  ODST.
[27:55.460 --> 27:55.640]  Oh.
[27:56.280 --> 27:56.600]  That is.
[27:56.740 --> 27:57.400]  That's the right answer.
[27:57.620 --> 27:57.860]  Oh.
[27:58.060 --> 27:58.880]  That's the original bip.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.820]  Man, I love ODST.
[28:03.320 --> 28:05.660]  We should try and do that firefight achievement.
[28:05.660 --> 28:08.400]  I don't think I ever played ODST.
[28:08.960 --> 28:10.800]  We should try and get Eric that achievement.
[28:11.500 --> 28:12.540]  What do you have to do?
[28:12.800 --> 28:13.160]  What's the achievement?
[28:13.160 --> 28:17.480]  You have to survive like four whole rounds of firefight or something.
[28:17.880 --> 28:18.260]  Is that?
[28:18.380 --> 28:18.720]  I don't...
[28:18.720 --> 28:19.240]  Is that what?
[28:20.020 --> 28:20.400]  It is.
[28:20.540 --> 28:21.660]  It takes like two hours.
[28:22.820 --> 28:23.200]  Whoa.
[28:24.680 --> 28:27.020]  That seems like it would take a long time.
[28:27.260 --> 28:28.340]  If you're not taking the chainsaw, I am.
[28:28.380 --> 28:29.240]  That chainsaw was sick.
[28:30.120 --> 28:30.700]  Oh, shit.
[28:31.580 --> 28:31.880]  What was that?
[28:32.040 --> 28:32.220]  Sorry.
[28:32.520 --> 28:32.860]  Wrong button.
[28:32.940 --> 28:33.220]  What happened?
[28:33.500 --> 28:34.380]  Hit the wrong button.
[28:34.380 --> 28:36.280]  Oh, there's a bunch of guys.
[28:36.280 --> 28:37.340]  That's really pissed everyone off.
[28:39.320 --> 28:40.920]  Yeah, chainsaw is kind of anti-bit.
[28:41.400 --> 28:43.180]  Well, yeah, you're not supposed to use it right now.
[28:43.180 --> 28:43.820]  Oh, incoming behind.
[28:44.080 --> 28:44.880]  Oh, shit.
[28:45.600 --> 28:45.960]  Charger.
[28:48.980 --> 28:49.700]  I'm just...
[28:49.700 --> 28:51.860]  Yeah, me and you are taking care of these behind guys.
[28:51.960 --> 28:52.120]  We're good.
[28:53.040 --> 28:53.520]  We got him.
[28:53.580 --> 28:53.800]  We got him.
[28:53.860 --> 28:55.220]  And Gavin walked in front of the bullet.
[28:55.440 --> 28:56.160]  Yeah, he does that.
[28:56.800 --> 28:57.180]  You've been known.
[28:59.100 --> 28:59.820]  Ah, Andrew.
[29:00.280 --> 29:00.640]  Ah!
[29:02.320 --> 29:02.680]  Ah!
[29:03.640 --> 29:06.160]  Yeah, swinging on out of there, really, it works.
[29:06.700 --> 29:07.360]  That was cool.
[29:09.780 --> 29:10.840]  Uh, nothing down here.
[29:10.840 --> 29:11.320]  Oh, anything in there?
[29:12.460 --> 29:12.820]  Nope.
[29:13.140 --> 29:14.500]  Oh, no, I'm not getting a med kit.
[29:15.540 --> 29:16.400]  I have a med kit?
[29:16.620 --> 29:17.160]  Oh, my God.
[29:17.680 --> 29:18.920]  Is that what normal gives you?
[29:18.980 --> 29:19.480]  You get a med kit?
[29:19.600 --> 29:20.060]  That's awesome.
[29:22.220 --> 29:22.800]  Oh, no!
[29:22.880 --> 29:23.480]  Oh, oh!
[29:23.880 --> 29:24.520]  I got you.
[29:24.560 --> 29:24.920]  I got you.
[29:25.320 --> 29:25.600]  Thank you.
[29:25.600 --> 29:26.160]  That was crazy.
[29:27.320 --> 29:28.280]  That was out of nowhere.
[29:30.840 --> 29:31.320]  Ooh!
[29:31.340 --> 29:32.980]  Holy shit, that's mine.
[29:35.900 --> 29:36.800]  Payload rifle?
[29:37.040 --> 29:37.640]  Fuck, yeah.
[29:39.600 --> 29:43.080]  Uh, refill grenades and then let's, uh, let's do this thing.
[29:44.780 --> 29:45.540]  Equipment full.
[29:46.660 --> 29:47.920]  Yeah, I don't know what equipment is.
[29:48.820 --> 29:50.560]  Mine is my, uh, my gun.
[29:52.600 --> 29:53.160]  Oh, nice.
[29:53.160 --> 29:53.600]  Alright, get up.
[29:53.760 --> 29:55.080]  Hacking and slashing.
[29:55.760 --> 29:56.940]  Yeah, I just refilled my ammo.
[29:57.100 --> 29:58.200]  I ain't, I ain't gonna waste that.
[29:58.440 --> 29:59.080]  I hear that.
[29:59.080 --> 30:00.040]  It's a good move.
[30:02.660 --> 30:04.280]  Nick, do you feel like your bips are
[30:05.100 --> 30:07.900]  a high pressure because everyone's watching whether you get the bip or not?
[30:08.660 --> 30:10.460]  Uh, I didn't until just now.
[30:10.560 --> 30:14.020]  I was gonna say, I think what happened is that you just put him in a high pressure bip situation.
[30:14.380 --> 30:14.700]  Wow!
[30:15.320 --> 30:16.040]  High pressure bips.
[30:16.320 --> 30:17.500]  Yep, I got this.
[30:17.600 --> 30:19.260]  You're like, now don't, don't think about this too much.
[30:19.340 --> 30:20.280]  There's no time left on the clock.
[30:21.220 --> 30:21.860]  Crossbow primary?
[30:22.760 --> 30:23.560]  I'm doing this one.
[30:24.680 --> 30:25.160]  Take this.
[30:25.180 --> 30:26.240]  I don't know if I should swap the...
[30:27.160 --> 30:27.760]  Are you taking that?
[30:27.760 --> 30:29.960]  Let's swap my pistol for a...
[30:29.960 --> 30:30.960]  Chainsaw here.
[30:31.460 --> 30:32.440]  And I think that's it.
[30:33.540 --> 30:35.860]  Oh, we got a, uh, a bandage kit here.
[30:35.980 --> 30:36.920]  If anyone needs health stuff.
[30:38.220 --> 30:38.900]  Oh, I have one already.
[30:39.060 --> 30:40.200]  Do you just have to have the pistol?
[30:40.400 --> 30:40.980]  Yeah, and you...
[30:40.980 --> 30:41.180]  Ouch.
[30:41.320 --> 30:42.180]  I think so.
[30:42.360 --> 30:46.120]  Well, I mean, there's, there's other weapons that you can get that take its place.
[30:46.920 --> 30:47.520]  Oh, really?
[30:47.760 --> 30:49.680]  Oh, like something that equivalent size.
[30:50.580 --> 30:51.700]  What do we have here?
[30:52.260 --> 30:53.060]  Some rifles?
[30:53.440 --> 30:53.840]  Shit.
[30:54.920 --> 30:55.540]  Guys are coming.
[30:57.920 --> 31:00.580]  I don't know if they're all coming yet.
[31:00.880 --> 31:02.340]  They're not activated yet.
[31:03.500 --> 31:04.240]  Uh, they're coming.
[31:04.440 --> 31:05.420]  They might be activated now.
[31:05.600 --> 31:06.280]  Yeah, they're activating.
[31:06.480 --> 31:07.300]  They're coming from behind.
[31:07.380 --> 31:08.040]  They're already up here.
[31:08.820 --> 31:10.220]  I'm trying to clear them the best I can.
[31:11.040 --> 31:11.440]  Shit.
[31:11.800 --> 31:13.180]  This is not an automatic rifle.
[31:13.700 --> 31:15.300]  Yeah, sometimes that happens.
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.060]  Yeah, they're popping from everywhere.
[31:19.480 --> 31:21.680]  All right.
[31:23.260 --> 31:24.100]  Well, hello.
[31:25.740 --> 31:26.140]  Ouch.
[31:26.680 --> 31:27.280]  You all right?
[31:27.940 --> 31:28.640]  I'm all right.
[31:36.680 --> 31:37.580]  All right, let's see.
[31:38.460 --> 31:39.860]  Switch back to the pistol for now, if I can.
[31:40.960 --> 31:42.560]  I'm filling in grenades.
[31:43.220 --> 31:44.040]  I'm filling ammo.
[31:45.280 --> 31:45.720]  All right, he's dead.
[31:45.840 --> 31:46.280]  How you guys doing?
[31:46.360 --> 31:46.700]  Oh, big guy.
[31:47.460 --> 31:47.940]  Big man.
[31:48.880 --> 31:49.160]  Oh.
[31:49.860 --> 31:50.660]  Oh, shit.
[31:51.340 --> 31:51.820]  You all right?
[31:52.560 --> 31:53.360]  Oh, he's on fire.
[31:53.760 --> 31:54.160]  Whoa.
[31:55.080 --> 31:55.880]  Someone's cooking me.
[32:01.300 --> 32:02.760]  Oh, they're still trying to climb.
[32:04.780 --> 32:05.420]  Grenade out.
[32:06.000 --> 32:06.260]  Healing.
[32:08.340 --> 32:08.960]  All right.
[32:08.980 --> 32:09.520]  More guys coming.
[32:10.720 --> 32:11.400]  I got you.
[32:11.940 --> 32:12.600]  Thank you.
[32:12.980 --> 32:13.220]  Yeah.
[32:13.240 --> 32:14.000]  Oh, I like that.
[32:16.220 --> 32:17.180]  Oh, explosion guy.
[32:17.320 --> 32:17.960]  Fucking kill him.
[32:18.140 --> 32:18.520]  Okay, there we go.
[32:18.640 --> 32:19.320]  Got him, got him, got him.
[32:20.860 --> 32:22.100]  Oh, explosion guy.
[32:23.640 --> 32:24.340]  Ah, shit.
[32:27.000 --> 32:27.400]  Disinfectant.
[32:29.080 --> 32:29.740]  There we go.
[32:30.620 --> 32:32.940]  Once they're down, you have to, like, step on them.
[32:34.780 --> 32:35.440]  Not always.
[32:35.440 --> 32:36.700]  You have to, like, make them suck your...
[32:36.700 --> 32:37.060]  Charger, charger.
[32:37.060 --> 32:38.080]  No, no, the Reaper.
[32:38.240 --> 32:39.440]  The Reaper guy, specifically.
[32:39.640 --> 32:40.060]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[32:40.060 --> 32:41.020]  You have to make them suck toes.
[32:41.060 --> 32:41.860]  Otherwise, they keep coming.
[32:42.540 --> 32:43.460]  All right, let's move down.
[32:44.400 --> 32:45.120]  Okay, move.
[32:45.180 --> 32:45.720]  Charger here.
[32:46.180 --> 32:46.540]  Where?
[32:47.380 --> 32:48.060]  Oh, shit.
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.100]  Oh, my God.
[32:49.280 --> 32:49.980]  Oh, shit.
[32:50.020 --> 32:50.440]  Found him.
[32:52.820 --> 32:53.620]  Nice, nice.
[32:54.060 --> 32:54.580]  Okay, we're good, we're good.
[32:54.600 --> 32:55.280]  Ooh, revolver.
[32:55.360 --> 32:56.280]  Anybody want a different pistol?
[32:57.480 --> 32:58.480]  I like the silencer.
[32:58.720 --> 32:59.220]  Let's get going.
[33:01.040 --> 33:02.100]  I still don't have a heavy.
[33:02.320 --> 33:02.600]  Shit.
[33:03.380 --> 33:04.520]  There's gonna be stuff down here.
[33:04.520 --> 33:06.020]  There's all kinds of stuff right here.
[33:06.680 --> 33:07.480]  Ammo full.
[33:07.840 --> 33:08.640]  Already have a med kit.
[33:09.820 --> 33:10.180]  Grabbing grenades.
[33:10.400 --> 33:11.340]  I'm actually gonna...
[33:11.340 --> 33:11.960]  If...
[33:11.960 --> 33:12.320]  Are you...
[33:12.320 --> 33:12.860]  Okay, you took it.
[33:13.080 --> 33:13.320]  Never mind.
[33:13.800 --> 33:14.440]  Uh, refill.
[33:14.980 --> 33:15.320]  Anything good?
[33:17.060 --> 33:17.460]  Uh...
[33:17.460 --> 33:17.780]  Equipment.
[33:17.880 --> 33:18.860]  Rocket launcher here.
[33:20.300 --> 33:21.980]  I'll snag that just in case.
[33:23.800 --> 33:24.960]  Yeah, any other heavies around?
[33:26.000 --> 33:26.920]  Oh, do you want this instead?
[33:28.420 --> 33:29.780]  I'll take what is left for a heavy.
[33:29.780 --> 33:31.200]  There's a rocket launcher here also.
[33:32.100 --> 33:33.140]  Oh, go get that gun.
[33:34.720 --> 33:35.980]  Okay, automatic turret.
[33:39.480 --> 33:39.960]  I guess I'll just...
[33:39.960 --> 33:41.820]  Do you think we should put it on top of the car, maybe?
[33:42.060 --> 33:42.400]  Can you?
[33:42.500 --> 33:44.340]  Well, I think it's a placement thing.
[33:44.380 --> 33:45.900]  It only lets you put it, like, two places.
[33:46.680 --> 33:47.260]  Oh, okay.
[33:47.420 --> 33:48.560]  All right, we got a minute.
[33:50.000 --> 33:51.460]  Uh, where's the barbed wire effective?
[33:51.720 --> 33:52.380]  In front of the door?
[33:54.020 --> 33:56.440]  I think it only lets you put it in certain places.
[33:56.920 --> 33:58.380]  Yeah, you can only do it in certain areas.
[33:58.960 --> 33:59.200]  Ah.
[33:59.520 --> 34:01.800]  Yeah, it'll show it on the floor where you can.
[34:01.800 --> 34:03.700]  I think you can only put it here and there.
[34:03.840 --> 34:06.200]  Oh, I'm gonna put one on the other side.
[34:06.240 --> 34:08.300]  That's good. Anything else? Anything down here? No?
[34:09.520 --> 34:10.740]  Okay, I think that's it.
[34:10.760 --> 34:11.380]  Okay, sweet.
[34:12.340 --> 34:15.940]  So where do they come from inside that keeps getting us killed?
[34:15.940 --> 34:16.580]  Oh, right behind us.
[34:17.540 --> 34:20.900]  Like, this atrium, like, where all these bodies are.
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.120]  They come from here, like, up above, like, there and there.
[34:25.380 --> 34:27.000]  And then they come down the, uh...
[34:27.800 --> 34:30.320]  Should we just focus backwards, then?
[34:31.060 --> 34:32.180]  I don't know.
[34:33.060 --> 34:34.520]  I really, dude, I really have no idea.
[34:36.520 --> 34:41.080]  There is, don't forget, there's a heavy machine gun over here if you need something.
[34:41.960 --> 34:43.040]  Where's the manned turret?
[34:43.760 --> 34:46.440]  We might, maybe we didn't get it. Maybe you don't get it every time.
[34:49.140 --> 34:49.580]  Oh, boy.
[34:50.240 --> 34:51.360]  Yeah, this is gonna be a rough one.
[34:51.520 --> 34:52.580]  All right, here we go, defend position.
[34:52.940 --> 34:54.620]  I guess keep an eye on behind us.
[34:55.420 --> 34:56.040]  We'll see.
[34:58.380 --> 34:58.960]  All right.
[34:58.960 --> 35:01.320]  I would say, I would say wait on the...
[35:02.740 --> 35:05.600]  Big, uh, rocket launcher, but I really have no idea.
[35:07.280 --> 35:11.140]  I think the only thing that could really improve this game is if it gave me a jump function.
[35:12.340 --> 35:13.880]  Oh, shit, I'm up here and I'm down.
[35:14.080 --> 35:15.480]  I got, I got jumped by a creeper.
[35:16.200 --> 35:17.020]  Someone can help me.
[35:17.280 --> 35:18.160]  Yep, coming up.
[35:18.580 --> 35:19.020]  Thank you.
[35:20.280 --> 35:21.380]  I'm gonna shoot you with the gun.
[35:23.360 --> 35:24.320]  Better climbing in.
[35:25.200 --> 35:25.600]  Healing.
[35:26.680 --> 35:27.720]  All right, I'm gonna start getting some rockets.
[35:28.400 --> 35:28.900]  Yeah, do it.
[35:33.190 --> 35:35.770]  Oh, for some reason I hit dodge from another game.
[35:37.910 --> 35:38.950]  Ah, the jump to my head.
[35:39.430 --> 35:40.090]  They're landing on my head.
[35:40.550 --> 35:40.890]  Where are you?
[35:40.890 --> 35:41.350]  Oh, they are.
[35:41.510 --> 35:42.790]  Oh, they're falling from the top.
[35:43.430 --> 35:43.890]  Big guy.
[35:44.290 --> 35:44.930]  Oh, I got a heavy.
[35:45.610 --> 35:46.690]  I killed the luck midair.
[35:46.750 --> 35:47.270]  I got an achievement.
[35:47.690 --> 35:47.950]  Nice.
[35:48.870 --> 35:49.310]  I'm trying.
[35:49.450 --> 35:50.110]  I'm trying, Nick.
[35:50.270 --> 35:50.950]  Nick, I'm trying.
[35:51.110 --> 35:51.550]  I'm getting pushed a little bit.
[35:51.850 --> 35:53.210]  Yeah, we're on you, we're on you, we're on you.
[35:53.270 --> 35:53.970]  I need to disinfect.
[35:54.050 --> 35:54.450]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[35:55.170 --> 35:55.450]  Ow.
[35:56.670 --> 35:57.330]  Watch your backs.
[35:57.690 --> 35:58.630]  Just watch your backs.
[35:59.610 --> 36:01.150]  And one of the barbed wires is down.
[36:01.670 --> 36:03.230]  If you need to heal...
[36:04.090 --> 36:06.870]  If you need to heal, try to move to, uh...
[36:06.870 --> 36:08.250]  Oh, bomb guy, bomb guy.
[36:10.170 --> 36:10.530]  Charger.
[36:10.670 --> 36:11.390]  Oh, shit.
[36:12.250 --> 36:12.770]  Oh, balls.
[36:13.910 --> 36:14.390]  Got him.
[36:14.810 --> 36:15.390]  Hell yeah.
[36:16.630 --> 36:17.390]  I got a heal.
[36:17.710 --> 36:19.470]  If you need to heal, put your back to a wall.
[36:20.130 --> 36:20.290]  Yeah.
[36:21.030 --> 36:21.750]  Oh, good call.
[36:22.090 --> 36:23.910]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:24.110 --> 36:25.830]  Who needs, uh, does anyone need a stim gun?
[36:26.050 --> 36:26.710]  I'm gonna give it to Nick.
[36:27.310 --> 36:27.910]  Yeah, give it to Nick.
[36:28.430 --> 36:30.010]  Oh, I'm getting dosed.
[36:30.470 --> 36:31.190]  Oh, that was you.
[36:31.470 --> 36:31.790]  Duh.
[36:34.730 --> 36:36.730]  We were in the middle of talking about it.
[36:38.490 --> 36:40.390]  Yeah, but what if I'm not paying attention?
[36:41.050 --> 36:42.170]  Yeah, what if I'm...
[36:42.170 --> 36:42.210]  Fuck.
[36:42.950 --> 36:43.630]  In a bloodlust.
[36:43.650 --> 36:44.270]  You alright, you alright?
[36:44.470 --> 36:45.270]  I'll move back, move back.
[36:45.370 --> 36:46.010]  Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
[36:46.010 --> 36:46.270]  Okay, we're good.
[36:47.070 --> 36:49.110]  I think I need to reactivate the automated...
[36:49.110 --> 36:49.890]  Yeah, I think we did it.
[36:50.650 --> 36:51.570]  I think we did it.
[36:52.410 --> 36:54.510]  Can we fill up on ammo here before we go?
[36:54.670 --> 36:54.970]  Yeah.
[36:54.970 --> 36:58.230]  Yeah, let's move up, grab...
[36:58.230 --> 36:59.190]  Oh no, Nick got jumped!
[36:59.430 --> 37:00.030]  Nick got jumped!
[37:00.130 --> 37:01.110]  Go up, go up the escalator!
[37:05.330 --> 37:06.070]  Oh, thank you.
[37:06.210 --> 37:06.850]  What the hell, man?
[37:06.970 --> 37:07.090]  Woo!
[37:07.890 --> 37:09.850]  Alright, well, the ammo was a little risky.
[37:12.950 --> 37:15.030]  Okay, let's refill the ammo and then let's make a move.
[37:15.350 --> 37:15.810]  Let's do it.
[37:16.270 --> 37:18.670]  Who in chat has read, uh, Celestial Globosis?
[37:18.810 --> 37:20.130]  Why don't you let us know with some pitchforks?
[37:20.130 --> 37:20.330]  Oh, that's...
[37:20.330 --> 37:20.750]  I wanna see it.
[37:20.790 --> 37:21.270]  Oh, man.
[37:21.550 --> 37:21.970]  What a...
[37:21.970 --> 37:23.150]  If anyone's read it...
[37:23.150 --> 37:23.950]  Oh, brother.
[37:24.610 --> 37:24.950]  Uh, sure.
[37:24.950 --> 37:25.950]  Shit, we're outside.
[37:26.650 --> 37:26.890]  Yep.
[37:27.430 --> 37:28.890]  Uh, should we go back in bit mode?
[37:30.110 --> 37:30.850]  Yeah, bit for now.
[37:31.810 --> 37:32.090]  Oh!
[37:33.770 --> 37:34.170]  Uh...

[37:35.610 --> 37:37.430]  Okay, that's... that's piss rats coming in.
[37:37.630 --> 37:37.890]  Okay.
[37:38.050 --> 37:38.750]  We've got some readers.
[37:39.690 --> 37:40.910]  I think we're anti-bipped.
[37:41.650 --> 37:42.050]  Okay.
[37:42.470 --> 37:43.450]  Uh, we might be okay.
[37:47.190 --> 37:51.190]  For those who haven't read it, uh, Celestial Globosis available on Amazon.
[37:51.530 --> 37:53.890]  It is, you can get it on, uh, Kindle Unlimited.
[37:54.910 --> 37:58.270]  It's Geoff's, uh, and myself's smut.
[37:58.450 --> 38:01.430]  It's number... number four in sci-fi erotica.
[38:01.530 --> 38:01.930]  Congratulations.
[38:02.690 --> 38:03.050]  Charger!
[38:04.550 --> 38:05.510]  Oh, shit!
[38:08.170 --> 38:09.050]  Oh, God!
[38:09.670 --> 38:10.710]  He took you guys all down.
[38:12.670 --> 38:12.810]  Ow!
[38:15.030 --> 38:15.570]  Got him!
[38:15.750 --> 38:15.850]  Oh, he's dead.
[38:16.250 --> 38:17.010]  Creeper, creeper.
[38:17.390 --> 38:18.310]  I'm down, I'm down.
[38:18.530 --> 38:20.070]  Okay, coming... coming up to you, coming up to you.
[38:20.150 --> 38:20.370]  Whoa!
[38:20.990 --> 38:21.750]  Coming up to you.
[38:21.750 --> 38:22.850]  I'll be alright.
[38:23.290 --> 38:24.350]  Okay, we're good, we're good.
[38:24.450 --> 38:25.210]  Looks like nothing else on us.
[38:25.210 --> 38:25.430]  Thank you.
[38:25.550 --> 38:25.850]  Alright, let's keep moving.
[38:29.330 --> 38:30.010]  There he is!
[38:30.230 --> 38:30.310]  Uh-oh.
[38:30.910 --> 38:31.450]  Oh, God!
[38:31.590 --> 38:31.930]  Get bipped!
[38:33.470 --> 38:36.030]  Oops, sorry.
[38:36.110 --> 38:36.250]  Ow!
[38:36.430 --> 38:36.790]  Ow!
[38:37.410 --> 38:39.230]  You just keep walking right in front of me.
[38:39.570 --> 38:39.870]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:42.790 --> 38:44.130]  Oh, Michael Caine's here?
[38:46.230 --> 38:47.010]  I'm with you, Nick.
[38:47.390 --> 38:47.930]  What's over here?
[38:48.190 --> 38:48.670]  Can you open that?
[38:48.890 --> 38:49.250]  Uh...
[38:49.250 --> 38:49.670]  No?
[38:49.910 --> 38:50.170]  No.
[38:50.310 --> 38:50.570]  Damn.
[38:50.570 --> 38:52.030]  I thought for sure.
[38:52.170 --> 38:52.610]  Yeah, right?
[38:52.810 --> 38:53.010]  Fuck.
[38:53.850 --> 38:54.570]  Punch zombies!
[38:56.890 --> 38:59.330]  Gavin, Gavin loves, uh...
[38:59.330 --> 38:59.990]  Okay, we cleared it?
[39:00.050 --> 39:00.910]  It's the ra- oh, hang on.
[39:00.970 --> 39:02.130]  You gotta walk up to this guy and take him.
[39:02.210 --> 39:02.570]  Thanks, man.
[39:04.310 --> 39:04.970]  You guys okay?
[39:05.330 --> 39:05.890]  I'm with Andrew.
[39:05.950 --> 39:06.470]  Oh, we got people.
[39:06.950 --> 39:07.290]  That's it.
[39:07.530 --> 39:08.290]  Okay, let's do it.
[39:08.350 --> 39:10.590]  I accidentally shot this guy in the head thinking he was...
[39:12.010 --> 39:12.870]  Oh, I got Charger!
[39:12.890 --> 39:13.550]  The train driver?
[39:13.690 --> 39:14.350]  Oh, Charger!
[39:15.330 --> 39:16.030]  Talk to him.
[39:16.490 --> 39:16.970]  Eric, run!
[39:17.270 --> 39:17.930]  I'm running!
[39:18.190 --> 39:19.090]  Run, fellas, run!
[39:19.210 --> 39:20.270]  Come circle back to this side.
[39:20.270 --> 39:21.150]  We'll cover you.
[39:23.630 --> 39:24.230]  Shot it down.
[39:24.850 --> 39:25.290]  Well, never mind.
[39:25.410 --> 39:26.430]  Are we gonna get supply crates?
[39:27.050 --> 39:27.210]  Yep.
[39:28.210 --> 39:29.930]  Okay, so there's a supply crate up here.
[39:29.990 --> 39:30.630]  Nick, come with me.
[39:31.550 --> 39:32.010]  Nick, come up.
[39:32.030 --> 39:32.790]  Get the one down low.
[39:33.290 --> 39:33.730]  Where are you?
[39:33.810 --> 39:34.810]  Oh, there's a Charger right here.
[39:35.190 --> 39:35.870]  Hold on, one sec.
[39:36.590 --> 39:37.230]  Fucking open.
[39:38.330 --> 39:38.850]  Oh, shit!
[39:38.870 --> 39:39.890]  He went around the trolley!
[39:41.990 --> 39:42.910]  Okay, delivering it.
[39:45.110 --> 39:45.870]  Try to be quick.
[39:46.370 --> 39:46.670]  Come on.
[39:46.690 --> 39:47.070]  Let's get it.
[39:47.330 --> 39:48.290]  We're trying to be fast.
[39:48.330 --> 39:49.070]  We had to take out Charger.
[39:50.090 --> 39:50.430]  Deliver.
[39:52.370 --> 39:52.710]  Screamer?
[39:52.870 --> 39:53.330]  What is that?
[39:53.870 --> 39:55.070]  What's the screamy icon guy?
[39:55.930 --> 39:56.890]  Oh, we got a bunch of zombies.
[39:57.190 --> 39:59.070]  I think he summons more Zombas.
[39:59.270 --> 39:59.530]  Oh, look!
[39:59.670 --> 39:59.950]  Oh!
[40:00.210 --> 40:00.770]  There's two in here, Eric.
[40:00.810 --> 40:01.270]  I got one.
[40:01.330 --> 40:01.630]  You get the other.
[40:01.630 --> 40:02.050]  I'll get this one.
[40:02.930 --> 40:04.450]  Gavin, I need to heal soon.
[40:04.730 --> 40:04.950]  Got it.
[40:06.270 --> 40:07.130]  Oh, shit, Eric.
[40:07.670 --> 40:07.910]  Incoming.
[40:08.050 --> 40:08.490]  Oh, fuck!
[40:14.390 --> 40:14.730]  Healing.
[40:15.350 --> 40:16.130]  Where's the Screamer?
[40:18.010 --> 40:19.290]  He's a red icon.
[40:20.650 --> 40:21.370]  Oh, shit!
[40:21.590 --> 40:22.310]  What is that guy?
[40:22.950 --> 40:23.770]  I don't know.
[40:23.850 --> 40:24.730]  I don't want to find out.
[40:25.390 --> 40:26.550]  But he seems to have died.
[40:26.790 --> 40:26.910]  All right.
[40:26.970 --> 40:28.110]  Reload, reload, reload, reload.
[40:28.670 --> 40:30.310]  More coming in, but not too, too many.
[40:30.470 --> 40:30.910]  You got it?
[40:31.090 --> 40:31.230]  Good?
[40:31.850 --> 40:32.370]  I think so.
[40:32.490 --> 40:32.610]  Yeah.
[40:32.970 --> 40:33.410]  Okay, we're good.
[40:34.150 --> 40:35.390]  We don't need to go back there.
[40:35.430 --> 40:36.410]  We got all the supplies in there.
[40:36.810 --> 40:37.930]  I'm going up to help them.
[40:38.270 --> 40:39.090]  I assume there's three of you.
[40:39.110 --> 40:41.130]  We're trying to come back with the supplies right now.
[40:42.790 --> 40:44.050]  I'm just getting pretty low on ammo.
[40:45.370 --> 40:46.390]  There's ammo, I think, in the train.
[40:46.390 --> 40:46.710]  All right, let's go.
[40:47.070 --> 40:48.430]  Oh, look out behind you!
[40:48.490 --> 40:49.710]  Oh, there's a jumper.
[40:49.950 --> 40:50.210]  Careful.
[40:50.470 --> 40:50.650]  Hunter.
[40:51.550 --> 40:52.910]  Ah, glug, glug, glug, glug.
[40:54.170 --> 40:54.850]  I'm down.
[40:55.050 --> 40:55.990]  I need, I need help.
[40:56.250 --> 40:57.190]  I need, I'm getting jumped.
[40:57.350 --> 40:57.770]  Thank you.
[40:57.970 --> 40:59.050]  Oh, I, oh, I'm down too!
[41:00.530 --> 41:01.390]  Charger, charger.
[41:02.270 --> 41:02.890]  Where from?
[41:03.790 --> 41:05.190]  Up, uh, where Eric and I are.
[41:06.730 --> 41:07.950]  I'm hurting, I'm hurting bad.
[41:09.910 --> 41:12.190]  Oh my god, where'd all these guys come from?
[41:12.590 --> 41:14.030]  I think they're from the screamer.
[41:14.370 --> 41:14.990]  I mean, what?
[41:15.610 --> 41:16.010]  What?
[41:16.430 --> 41:18.630]  Oh, they're coming through the fucking floor.
[41:19.510 --> 41:20.590]  All right, this is Eric's perspective.
[41:23.470 --> 41:24.430]  Fuck off.
[41:24.650 --> 41:26.230]  Found the screamer.
[41:26.690 --> 41:27.370]  Got him.
[41:27.930 --> 41:28.830]  There we are.
[41:30.010 --> 41:30.870]  Here's Andrew.
[41:31.070 --> 41:31.890]  Oh, fuck.
[41:32.410 --> 41:33.510]  Hanging out in the store.
[41:34.090 --> 41:34.690]  Nick needs help.
[41:35.170 --> 41:36.490]  Yeah, I, I'm...
[41:36.490 --> 41:36.830]  Yeah, we're trying.
[41:37.050 --> 41:38.750]  It's, it's just me right now.
[41:39.630 --> 41:40.470]  Yeah, goodbye.
[41:40.930 --> 41:41.950]  I'm about to be a zomba.
[41:42.790 --> 41:44.050]  Uh-oh, Nick got up.
[41:44.850 --> 41:45.530]  I'm down.
[41:47.790 --> 41:48.270]  Fuck.
[41:49.910 --> 41:50.350]  Ah.
[41:50.590 --> 41:51.030]  Aww.
[41:52.330 --> 41:52.530]  Meds.
[41:52.630 --> 41:54.830]  I need meds.
[41:55.730 --> 41:56.470]  Let's give it a try.
[41:57.370 --> 41:57.810]  Help.
[41:58.370 --> 41:58.950]  Damn it.
[41:58.950 --> 41:59.450]  I'm on the ground.
[41:59.710 --> 42:00.150]  Sausages.
[42:00.950 --> 42:01.230]  It's hard.
[42:04.170 --> 42:05.710]  Do you think there's a checkpoint somewhere?
[42:06.190 --> 42:07.210]  I don't think so.
[42:07.810 --> 42:09.770]  Oh, I don't want to play the beginning of that again.
[42:10.110 --> 42:11.070]  Oh my god.
[42:11.750 --> 42:11.870]  Really?
[42:11.870 --> 42:13.290]  Guess what you're about to do.
[42:14.970 --> 42:15.410]  Aww.
[42:17.810 --> 42:18.250]  Oh, I don't want to play the beginning of that again.
[42:18.250 --> 42:20.490]  Oh, we all killed like a similar amount.
[42:20.590 --> 42:21.090]  That's crazy.
[42:21.670 --> 42:22.250]  Oh, really?
[42:22.750 --> 42:23.130]  Yeah.
[42:23.290 --> 42:27.030]  The top, the most was one, uh, 270 and the lowest was like 250.
[42:28.010 --> 42:28.410]  Crazy.
[42:30.010 --> 42:31.450]  I'm gonna customize a little bit.
[42:31.550 --> 42:32.830]  Let's see if I can make my guy better.
[42:33.790 --> 42:35.070]  Oh, that's not a bad idea.
[42:37.790 --> 42:39.430]  Oh, reloading speed increased.
[42:40.850 --> 42:41.570]  Oh, the pistol.
[42:41.850 --> 42:42.630]  What's level two do?
[42:44.950 --> 42:46.070]  Oh, power up.
[42:49.410 --> 42:52.230]  Oh, I could be a good medic.
[42:52.470 --> 42:52.830]  Wow.
[42:57.450 --> 43:01.070]  If you say so, you know, it is, who am I to judge?
[43:06.960 --> 43:08.100]  Oh, look at that.
[43:08.300 --> 43:11.140]  I'm going to do revive speed.
[43:12.840 --> 43:14.960]  Damn, that's so cool.
[43:16.340 --> 43:19.600]  Can you only have one power up thing at a time?
[43:20.320 --> 43:23.700]  Like gunslinger, you have like fire in the hole, impact grenades, power nap.
[43:23.820 --> 43:25.780]  Can you have like a bunch of those or just one?
[43:27.200 --> 43:27.920]  I don't care.
[43:27.980 --> 43:28.740]  What the fuck do I care?
[43:28.840 --> 43:29.680]  I'm just going to buy one.
[43:30.900 --> 43:32.460]  One per column, I think.
[43:32.840 --> 43:33.080]  Yeah.
[43:33.180 --> 43:34.620]  It looks like it's maybe one per column.
[43:35.580 --> 43:36.080]  All right.
[43:36.160 --> 43:36.660]  That's good enough.
[43:37.020 --> 43:37.260]  Cool.
[43:38.240 --> 43:38.560]  All right.
[43:38.800 --> 43:40.640]  I am ready.
[43:41.180 --> 43:42.800]  Oh, let's try it again.
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.180]  Let's do it this time for real.
[43:48.140 --> 43:49.580]  Appreciate you guys being here.
[43:50.060 --> 43:51.180]  Uh, weird Friday.
[43:51.180 --> 43:55.240]  We're only 15 minutes away from the best time quitting time.
[43:56.140 --> 43:59.560]  Is anyone watching from their jobs?
[44:00.500 --> 44:00.940]  Oh, yeah.
[44:01.060 --> 44:01.720]  Yeah, me.
[44:02.500 --> 44:03.100]  I am.
[44:06.260 --> 44:10.040]  Man, I'm proofing episode 17 of regulation podcast.
[44:10.380 --> 44:12.380]  It's a it's a real doozy.
[44:12.800 --> 44:15.420]  I think it's a classic episode.
[44:16.700 --> 44:18.660]  There's some twists and turns in this one.
[44:21.180 --> 44:25.240]  And then if you're watching, if you're joining us live, we got a we got a real special treat
[44:25.240 --> 44:26.900]  coming out for you tomorrow for the gameplay.
[44:29.200 --> 44:30.980]  Oh, nice favorite.
[44:32.400 --> 44:34.900]  People are going to see true colors.
[44:35.180 --> 44:35.900]  Oh, is that one?
[44:36.220 --> 44:40.120]  Is this the one that is like, wow, wow.
[44:41.860 --> 44:46.320]  We were going to put something else out tomorrow, and then we pivoted to this.
[44:46.460 --> 44:49.960]  And I'm feeling now that I know what episode it is that's coming out.
[44:49.960 --> 44:51.080]  I cannot wait.
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.860]  It will be I I'm so excited to wake up tomorrow, watch the video and be absolved.
[44:57.980 --> 45:02.060]  Just to like, just to know, just to know what who's not.
[45:02.100 --> 45:05.420]  But you're not fully absolved because no, no, no, no.
[45:05.420 --> 45:06.360]  I'm completely absolved.
[45:06.940 --> 45:09.920]  You do say team tape maybe 500 times.
[45:10.020 --> 45:12.640]  Yeah, but that's yeah, but that's not what I'm trying to be absolved for.
[45:12.720 --> 45:14.020]  I'm for team tape, dude.
[45:14.040 --> 45:15.340]  Are you not for team tape?
[45:15.940 --> 45:18.760]  Uh, I am, but I really start to piss myself off.
[45:22.200 --> 45:23.780]  It's not very team tape of you, dude.
[45:24.080 --> 45:25.100]  It's not very team tape.
[45:28.100 --> 45:30.400]  Honestly, in my head, team tape is pretty pro team tape.
[45:32.060 --> 45:32.680]  Pro team?
[45:33.040 --> 45:33.980]  Yeah, pro team tape.
[45:34.600 --> 45:35.300]  Pro team tape.
[45:38.140 --> 45:40.400]  I'm a big fan of some good ideas.
[45:41.740 --> 45:42.980]  Who used the bad ones?
[45:44.780 --> 45:46.520]  Oh, they have a, they had a screamer, I think.
[45:46.720 --> 45:46.860]  Oh.
[45:47.640 --> 45:48.620]  That we were trying to...
[45:49.380 --> 45:50.180]  Oh, it might be good.
[45:51.260 --> 45:51.560]  Yeah.
[45:52.400 --> 45:53.340]  Oh, there's a charger.
[45:54.180 --> 45:54.900]  Sure is.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.260]  I hear him, but where is he?
[45:59.960 --> 46:01.300]  Nick, you're shooting a wall.
[46:02.260 --> 46:03.180]  Who are you talking to?
[46:03.280 --> 46:03.820]  You talking to yourself?
[46:03.820 --> 46:05.860]  You said that like you were reading a comment.
[46:06.300 --> 46:06.480]  Yep.
[46:06.840 --> 46:07.740]  Hey, here's the charger.
[46:08.260 --> 46:08.620]  Oops.
[46:09.440 --> 46:10.380]  Saw a guy.
[46:10.800 --> 46:11.960]  Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.
[46:12.480 --> 46:13.860]  Good communication, Gavin.
[46:14.540 --> 46:15.400]  Man, guy.
[46:16.760 --> 46:17.800]  Beast creature.
[46:18.620 --> 46:19.140]  Lagoon.
[46:20.940 --> 46:21.660]  Lagoon man.
[46:22.340 --> 46:24.120]  Behind, behind, behind, behind, behind, behind.
[46:26.400 --> 46:27.480]  I'm going loud.
[46:31.340 --> 46:33.700]  This is somehow going much worse than last time.
[46:33.820 --> 46:35.160]  I don't understand what happened.
[46:35.400 --> 46:35.940]  The melee is so powerful.
[46:37.040 --> 46:37.960]  From the elevator side.
[46:38.100 --> 46:42.620]  The melee is very powerful, but like the trade-off is that when they're right on top of you,
[46:42.860 --> 46:43.620]  it's dangerous.
[46:44.160 --> 46:44.620]  Big door.
[46:46.740 --> 46:47.980]  All right, hazmat boy down.
[46:48.180 --> 46:48.380]  Oh, fuck.
[46:48.480 --> 46:48.820]  Oh, hello.
[46:48.960 --> 46:49.660]  Got him. We got him.
[46:50.140 --> 46:53.740]  I have a perk now that will highlight any special zombie.
[46:53.940 --> 46:55.660]  Oh, dude, I noticed that. Pretty good.
[46:56.040 --> 46:56.680]  That rules.
[46:56.900 --> 46:58.100]  Oh, I like that perk a lot.
[46:58.340 --> 47:00.360]  I almost hit Andrew with a machete.
[47:00.560 --> 47:00.740]  Charger, charger.
[47:01.280 --> 47:01.640]  Oh.
[47:02.360 --> 47:02.920]  Perk a lot.
[47:03.740 --> 47:06.360]  He's weaker in the back, so try to make it count, is what it says.
[47:06.940 --> 47:07.240]  Okay.
[47:07.380 --> 47:08.020]  What is this? Okay.
[47:08.200 --> 47:11.420]  So this thing goes down, and then you have to like step on it.
[47:11.980 --> 47:13.240]  It's like the only way it'll stay down.
[47:13.760 --> 47:14.480]  Just melee.
[47:15.200 --> 47:15.440]  Daddy.
[47:15.680 --> 47:15.860]  What?
[47:15.860 --> 47:16.500]  Huh?
[47:16.780 --> 47:16.900]  What?
[47:17.700 --> 47:18.680]  Oh, that seems useful.
[47:19.960 --> 47:20.660]  What, the daddy?
[47:20.800 --> 47:21.760]  Shotgun secondary.
[47:22.040 --> 47:22.940]  Oh, there goes my pistol.
[47:23.160 --> 47:23.420]  All right.
[47:24.400 --> 47:25.000]  Oh, hello.
[47:25.360 --> 47:28.980]  I grabbed adrenaline, which will let me pick myself back up.
[47:29.460 --> 47:29.960]  Oh, nice.
[47:31.120 --> 47:33.700]  Sounds like you're stepping on the healer's toes a little bit.
[47:34.860 --> 47:37.540]  Well, you know, maybe the heals could be a little bit better.
[47:38.020 --> 47:39.740]  All right, well, yeah, you're probably right.
[47:40.480 --> 47:43.020]  I heard that this healer is supposed to be a good healer now.
[47:43.560 --> 47:44.400]  That is what I've heard.
[47:44.480 --> 47:45.740]  I've heard that there's an upgrade in the healer.
[47:45.740 --> 47:47.180]  Oh, no.
[47:47.740 --> 47:49.920]  Are you sure we're not on a harder difficulty?
[47:50.160 --> 47:51.140]  What's going on?
[47:51.440 --> 47:51.640]  Can we just run him out?
[47:51.800 --> 47:53.320]  Let's just run him out and then hop in.
[47:53.380 --> 47:53.740]  Fuck him.
[47:54.020 --> 47:55.020]  Well, he got getting...
[47:55.660 --> 47:58.000]  Oh, big man.
[47:58.120 --> 48:00.160]  The upgraded healer is getting his ass kicked.
[48:00.860 --> 48:02.540]  Well, they had to stop the healer first.
[48:02.580 --> 48:02.760]  Get in.
[48:05.080 --> 48:05.960]  What happened?
[48:06.180 --> 48:06.640]  Oh, God.
[48:07.380 --> 48:08.520]  What's going on?
[48:09.460 --> 48:10.880]  Oh, look how fast I can heal now.
[48:11.100 --> 48:11.540]  Wow.
[48:13.360 --> 48:15.960]  I wish I'd upgraded stuff other than guns.
[48:17.160 --> 48:18.980]  Healers really good at healing themselves.
[48:19.580 --> 48:21.060]  Yeah, that's why they're called a healer.
[48:22.300 --> 48:23.660]  Hey, you guys remember this place?
[48:23.780 --> 48:25.540]  It's a nickname and not a class.
[48:26.740 --> 48:28.140]  Oh, I love this gun.
[48:28.520 --> 48:28.880]  RPG.
[48:30.580 --> 48:31.100]  RPGizzle?
[48:31.460 --> 48:32.160]  Who's taking it?
[48:33.320 --> 48:34.060]  Another RPG.
[48:34.660 --> 48:36.840]  I don't want this responsibility, but I will.
[48:39.500 --> 48:43.280]  I could use a packet of stim guns.
[48:43.500 --> 48:44.220]  Where is they all?
[48:49.080 --> 48:51.180]  Why are there a bunch of rats over here?
[48:51.800 --> 48:53.000]  Oh, your family.
[48:54.760 --> 48:56.400]  No, they're attacking me.
[49:02.020 --> 49:04.620]  That was scary, dude.
[49:05.440 --> 49:06.880]  You got killed by a flock of rats.
[49:06.880 --> 49:07.600]  What happened?
[49:08.180 --> 49:08.720]  Bunch of them.
[49:08.780 --> 49:09.700]  Bunch of them coming in.
[49:10.340 --> 49:11.520]  We got the raid.
[49:13.740 --> 49:15.480]  Why were there so many rats?
[49:17.840 --> 49:20.020]  Is bloody Dishonored Guy in the room?
[49:20.360 --> 49:21.000]  What happened?
[49:22.200 --> 49:23.480]  Why come so much rats?
[49:28.700 --> 49:29.720]  I got you covered, Andrew.
[49:30.080 --> 49:31.180]  Oh, we got a special right here.
[49:32.360 --> 49:32.760]  Okay.
[49:34.240 --> 49:34.880]  I got him.
[49:34.940 --> 49:35.940]  I'm just shooting this pile.
[49:36.080 --> 49:37.080]  No, I'm doing the same thing.
[49:37.080 --> 49:38.480]  I got that big fucking...
[49:38.480 --> 49:39.040]  Dude, Gavin.
[49:39.460 --> 49:41.620]  This worked for us really well.
[49:41.760 --> 49:42.580]  We tore that up.
[49:42.580 --> 49:43.380]  Oh, I see the screamer.
[49:43.380 --> 49:44.580]  Yeah, can you get that screamer?
[49:44.620 --> 49:45.040]  I'm shooting myself.
[49:46.740 --> 49:47.140]  Oh, he's down.
[49:47.140 --> 49:47.540]  Yeah, he should be dead.
[49:47.640 --> 49:47.880]  Good work.
[49:48.900 --> 49:49.080]  There you go.
[49:49.080 --> 49:50.100]  Charge it, charge it, charge it.
[49:50.160 --> 49:50.280]  Ah!
[49:51.520 --> 49:52.560]  Ah, it's hitting the rats!
[49:52.760 --> 49:54.060]  I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[49:54.160 --> 49:54.220]  Oh.
[49:55.280 --> 49:56.100]  Get out of here, you.
[49:58.080 --> 49:58.360]  Disinfecting.
[49:58.380 --> 50:00.020]  I'm sick of him, I'm sick of the rats.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.420]  Your family will be upset to hear that.
[50:06.280 --> 50:07.340]  The rats keep...
[50:07.340 --> 50:09.800]  Gavin keeps shooting the freaking railing.
[50:12.820 --> 50:13.600]  Oh, nice shot.
[50:14.500 --> 50:16.040]  Okay, let's uh, let's move.
[50:16.720 --> 50:17.080]  Yeah.
[50:17.960 --> 50:19.620]  There's some more guys coming, they're climbing.
[50:20.020 --> 50:20.580]  There we go, he's good.
[50:21.220 --> 50:22.020]  That's something that I want.
[50:22.480 --> 50:23.220]  Ammo, man.
[50:23.380 --> 50:24.220]  Isn't there ammo here?
[50:24.820 --> 50:25.060]  Yep.
[50:25.620 --> 50:26.740]  I think there's some down here.
[50:27.420 --> 50:28.120]  Yeah, come over here.
[50:28.140 --> 50:28.980]  Can you come over to where we're at?
[50:29.260 --> 50:29.920]  There's tons of ammo.
[50:30.420 --> 50:30.540]  And there's guns.
[50:30.540 --> 50:31.260]  He's right, there's some downstairs.
[50:31.360 --> 50:32.220]  Yeah, there's ammo right here too.
[50:32.540 --> 50:32.780]  Okay.
[50:32.780 --> 50:34.080]  Hold on, I'm reloading.
[50:34.580 --> 50:35.960]  Refill da ammo.
[50:36.180 --> 50:36.680]  Equipment.
[50:36.860 --> 50:37.620]  This is my perspective.
[50:38.760 --> 50:41.380]  Got a, uh, heavy RPG here.
[50:41.820 --> 50:43.360]  Ooh, I got barbed wire defense.
[50:44.400 --> 50:46.420]  Okay, here's a flamethrower.
[50:47.120 --> 50:48.400]  Just an assault rifle.
[50:48.880 --> 50:49.920]  And an assault shotgun.
[50:50.140 --> 50:50.900]  You can take it if you want.
[50:51.160 --> 50:51.520]  I'll take it.
[50:51.600 --> 50:52.280]  The RPG is one shot.
[50:52.280 --> 50:53.080]  Oh, here's an automated turret.
[50:54.780 --> 50:55.780]  Is that right?
[50:58.620 --> 50:59.320]  For what?
[50:59.940 --> 51:01.420]  Assault shotgun, heavy flamethrower as well.
[51:01.420 --> 51:02.100]  The big RPG.
[51:03.940 --> 51:06.220]  I don't know what this auto turret to be.
[51:06.340 --> 51:07.200]  Repair defenses.
[51:08.080 --> 51:09.360]  Automatic turret defense.
[51:09.520 --> 51:10.380]  I'm gonna put it here again.
[51:10.460 --> 51:11.540]  That worked for us last time.
[51:11.960 --> 51:13.360]  Yeah, I also have one on this side, Eric.
[51:14.040 --> 51:14.560]  Okay, cool.
[51:15.220 --> 51:18.140]  And do we have any more, uh, barbed wire or anything?
[51:18.340 --> 51:18.780]  Or is that it?
[51:19.840 --> 51:21.600]  Uh, I don't think it spawned for us this time.
[51:21.620 --> 51:22.740]  No, no, I got barbed wire.
[51:22.800 --> 51:23.560]  I got one barbed wire.
[51:23.560 --> 51:23.840]  Oh, did you?
[51:24.020 --> 51:24.600]  I put it in.
[51:25.520 --> 51:27.120]  All it does is slow them down.
[51:28.180 --> 51:30.820]  Yeah, but you know, I'll take it.
[51:32.220 --> 51:32.540]  Uh...
[51:32.540 --> 51:33.800]  I'm not seeing anything else.
[51:33.940 --> 51:35.000]  Nah, that looks like it's it.
[51:35.780 --> 51:38.080]  Okay, so there's a chainsaw here.
[51:38.200 --> 51:41.020]  We have a bunch of stuff, but we don't...
[51:41.020 --> 51:45.520]  There's not a ton in terms of, like, defense things, I think.
[51:46.560 --> 51:47.960]  Yeah, we got a lot of special weapons.
[51:48.240 --> 51:48.500]  Yeah.
[51:50.000 --> 51:50.760]  Yeah, a lot.
[51:50.900 --> 51:52.220]  A lot of special weapons.
[51:53.140 --> 51:53.540]  Which is great.
[51:53.660 --> 51:54.960]  I keep running into special zombies.
[51:56.800 --> 52:02.220]  The escalator that I'm on over here, this is where the ammo is if you guys need to refill ammo.
[52:02.220 --> 52:03.440]  It's just right up these stairs.
[52:04.780 --> 52:05.500]  Oh, yeah.
[52:06.660 --> 52:08.100]  Can I just live by this?
[52:09.160 --> 52:10.060]  We could try.
[52:11.480 --> 52:16.040]  I think we just have to keep our backs to the wall and try our best to take out what we can.
[52:17.080 --> 52:17.620]  All right.
[52:17.860 --> 52:20.120]  Just hit things hard at the top and see what we can do.
[52:20.620 --> 52:21.940]  And we have to watch out for, like...
[52:21.940 --> 52:22.600]  Oh, you know what?
[52:22.680 --> 52:28.160]  Honestly, the thing that Andrew has that highlights specials, I think is really gonna help us.
[52:28.700 --> 52:30.020]  Yeah, call them as you see them.
[52:30.140 --> 52:30.820]  Okay, they're coming.
[52:31.840 --> 52:32.520]  Oh, there they are.
[52:36.810 --> 52:37.970]  Man, they look pissed.
[52:38.770 --> 52:39.550]  Yeah, they do that.
[52:41.830 --> 52:43.550]  Okay, I'm watching behind us for right now.
[52:47.130 --> 52:47.830]  All right, incoming.
[52:48.170 --> 52:48.710]  Yeah, I see them.
[52:49.610 --> 52:50.990]  Oh, two specials.
[52:51.050 --> 52:51.190]  Three.
[52:51.270 --> 52:52.450]  Gas guys, explosion guy.
[52:53.530 --> 52:54.230]  How do you...
[52:54.850 --> 52:55.210]  There you go.
[52:55.210 --> 52:55.650]  Okay, he's dead.
[52:55.750 --> 52:56.270]  There you go.
[52:56.710 --> 52:57.070]  Good work.
[52:58.310 --> 52:58.830]  Oh, hello.
[53:03.530 --> 53:03.810]  RPG.
[53:04.310 --> 53:05.290]  Eric, there's a guy up there with you.
[53:05.330 --> 53:05.730]  Yeah, I see him.
[53:05.730 --> 53:06.270]  I got him.
[53:06.310 --> 53:06.850]  Thank you.
[53:08.430 --> 53:09.450]  Okay, holding the front.
[53:10.210 --> 53:10.490]  Yep.
[53:13.890 --> 53:14.830]  God, that was it?
[53:17.710 --> 53:19.490]  Fuck, I guess I'll just take this and have it.
[53:21.270 --> 53:22.270]  Oh, behind, behind.
[53:22.590 --> 53:22.830]  Nick.
[53:23.530 --> 53:23.630]  Oh.
[53:24.010 --> 53:24.410]  Oh, yeah.
[53:24.570 --> 53:25.090]  Going for ammo.
[53:25.810 --> 53:26.090]  Okay.
[53:27.110 --> 53:28.350]  Oh, we got that one.
[53:28.390 --> 53:28.550]  Nice, good.
[53:28.750 --> 53:29.050]  Nice.
[53:29.150 --> 53:30.810]  Oh, thank you.
[53:30.810 --> 53:35.910]  Oh, that guy got ripped to pieces.
[53:36.710 --> 53:37.470]  Oh, another charger.
[53:40.770 --> 53:41.970]  Working on him, working on him.
[53:42.330 --> 53:43.070]  Nice, nice, nice.
[53:43.970 --> 53:45.950]  Another charger, second one, second one in the middle.
[53:47.490 --> 53:48.130]  Oh, Nick.
[53:49.050 --> 53:50.110]  I did not mean to do that.
[53:50.110 --> 53:51.050]  No, no, you're all right, you're all right.
[53:51.410 --> 53:51.910]  But it worked.
[53:52.310 --> 53:52.970]  It worked real well.
[53:53.410 --> 53:53.770]  Who's down?
[53:53.830 --> 53:54.170]  What happened?
[53:55.110 --> 53:56.150]  No, I said the charger's down.
[53:56.190 --> 53:56.610]  Oh, okay, cool.

[54:29.390 --> 54:29.750]  I'm covering.
[54:30.630 --> 54:31.610]  Okay, I got it, Eric.
[54:31.790 --> 54:32.110]  Thank you.

[54:38.130 --> 54:40.270]  You're healing me, you're healing me, you're healing me, you're healing me.
[54:40.730 --> 54:42.130]  You were healing me, not yourself.
[54:42.470 --> 54:43.290]  You were healing me.
[54:43.350 --> 54:44.730]  All right, Nick, you got lots of health.
[54:46.190 --> 54:47.130]  I stimmed you, Eric.
[54:47.370 --> 54:48.010]  Thank you.
[54:49.990 --> 54:51.370]  Oh, on me, on me, on me, on me.
[54:51.450 --> 54:53.330]  Special zombie, special zombie, up the escalator.
[54:54.610 --> 54:55.710]  Oh, it's down, it's down.
[54:56.010 --> 54:57.370]  Tell us if you're going upstairs.
[54:57.370 --> 54:59.130]  Oh, sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
[55:01.230 --> 55:02.150]  Hey, good work, you guys.
[55:02.730 --> 55:05.190]  This is the wrong team to talk about communication.
[55:06.550 --> 55:07.090]  What's that?
[55:07.510 --> 55:08.130]  Yeah, exactly.
[55:08.930 --> 55:09.350]  Hey, Eric.
[55:09.510 --> 55:09.710]  Yeah.
[55:09.750 --> 55:09.870]  Sure.
[55:13.970 --> 55:16.990]  Bringing that up with Geoff, he immediately pointed at Gavin.
[55:18.950 --> 55:25.110]  It was just like, yeah, that's absolutely the problem.
[55:25.110 --> 55:28.190]  Uh, I desperately need health.
[55:28.370 --> 55:31.030]  I have, I'm red, like, the very bottom, like, I'm bad.
[55:31.050 --> 55:31.710]  All right, let me heal you.
[55:31.950 --> 55:32.310]  Okay, cool.
[55:32.590 --> 55:33.090]  I'm right here.
[55:36.710 --> 55:37.070]  Oops.
[55:37.810 --> 55:38.170]  Oh.
[55:39.930 --> 55:40.750]  Really wanted that.
[55:41.690 --> 55:42.990]  Uh, anyone with this payload rifle?
[55:43.030 --> 55:43.530]  Yes, me, desperately.
[55:43.750 --> 55:44.130]  Thank you.
[55:44.390 --> 55:44.590]  Okay.
[55:47.010 --> 55:47.970]  I didn't take it from you.
[55:48.130 --> 55:49.050]  I know, I know.
[55:49.190 --> 55:51.070]  I really wanted to get it, but I really needed to heal.
[55:51.250 --> 55:52.250]  Just staring at it.
[55:52.410 --> 55:52.530]  I see.
[55:52.950 --> 55:53.130]  Yep.
[55:53.130 --> 55:57.790]  Let me take, uh, med packs because I can heal other people and it gives me a little bit of health too.
[55:58.050 --> 55:58.270]  Okay.
[55:58.390 --> 55:58.750]  Oh, shit.
[55:58.930 --> 55:59.330]  Okay, cool.
[55:59.490 --> 56:01.330]  All right, if we see any more, we'll, uh, make sure you grab it.
[56:01.470 --> 56:01.790]  That's great.
[56:01.970 --> 56:03.310]  Yeah, we'll let you grab them instead of us.
[56:03.350 --> 56:04.470]  Let's go into bit mode here.
[56:05.310 --> 56:05.570]  Yeah.
[56:07.770 --> 56:09.190]  Hey, silent but deadly, fellas.
[56:11.470 --> 56:12.130]  I'm going machete.
[56:12.630 --> 56:12.890]  Cool.
[56:16.650 --> 56:16.970]  Okay.
[56:20.630 --> 56:21.290]  Okay, we're moving.
[56:21.370 --> 56:21.890]  Let's keep going.
[56:22.690 --> 56:27.150]  Uh, Andrew, do you want to go downstairs, talk to this guy, and then we can stay at the top and,
[56:27.370 --> 56:28.410]  uh, grab these?
[56:28.530 --> 56:28.770]  I'm on it.
[56:28.870 --> 56:29.590]  Oh, a bunch of guys.
[56:29.690 --> 56:30.410]  A bunch of guys down here.
[56:30.510 --> 56:30.770]  Fuck.
[56:30.930 --> 56:31.050]  Okay.
[56:31.110 --> 56:33.630]  Yeah, I cleared them last time from up here.
[56:34.170 --> 56:34.590]  Got it.
[56:34.650 --> 56:35.230]  Let's keep doing that.
[56:35.770 --> 56:39.250]  Gavin, that thing is, like, that crossbow is, like, fucking choice, man.
[56:39.410 --> 56:40.750]  Oh, is that from the crossbow?
[56:40.890 --> 56:41.290]  I didn't realize.
[56:41.730 --> 56:43.990]  Oh, we got a screamer or something in the train, it looks like.
[56:44.510 --> 56:46.670]  We have to take, we have to take that thing out.
[56:46.750 --> 56:47.570]  Aw, shit, Charger.
[56:48.310 --> 56:49.270]  Oh, he's dropping down.
[56:49.950 --> 56:51.210]  Charger's falling on his arsehole.
[56:53.950 --> 56:54.890]  I'm shooting him in the ankles.
[56:56.130 --> 56:57.370]  His integrity must be low.
[57:01.560 --> 57:02.100]  He's down.
[57:02.180 --> 57:02.360]  Nice.
[57:06.290 --> 57:06.990]  Eric, you all right?
[57:07.130 --> 57:08.670]  I'm disinfecting, give me a second.
[57:09.450 --> 57:10.550]  I got you, I'll cover you.
[57:10.670 --> 57:11.650]  Okay, we're good, we're good.
[57:12.770 --> 57:16.910]  Okay, yeah, if we can just start the thing, we can grab the two that are up here and then go.
[57:17.730 --> 57:18.010]  Yeah.
[57:18.370 --> 57:19.190]  Is somebody down?
[57:20.850 --> 57:21.630]  It's one of them.
[57:22.270 --> 57:22.770]  Oh, it's the guy.
[57:22.770 --> 57:23.330]  One of the folks.
[57:25.750 --> 57:26.030]  Weird.
[57:26.490 --> 57:27.850]  Hey, Gavin, could you come over here and heal me?
[57:27.990 --> 57:29.110]  There's a med kit down here.
[57:29.990 --> 57:30.190]  Yeah.
[57:30.270 --> 57:31.810]  Can we talk to the train driver?
[57:31.950 --> 57:32.750]  Yeah, he's doing it right now.
[57:32.870 --> 57:33.910]  Yeah, I'm talking to him.
[57:33.970 --> 57:34.970]  Nick, are you up here with me?
[57:35.050 --> 57:35.550]  Okay, let's go.
[57:36.730 --> 57:38.670]  I'm getting the furthest one.
[57:38.790 --> 57:39.610]  It's in the train.
[57:39.730 --> 57:40.410]  Okay, I got this one.
[57:40.530 --> 57:41.930]  Oh, I can't, you can't hurtle that.
[57:42.050 --> 57:42.150]  No.
[57:42.230 --> 57:43.630]  Right here, behind you, behind you, behind you.
[57:43.730 --> 57:44.050]  You got it?
[57:44.870 --> 57:45.150]  Yeah.
[57:45.410 --> 57:45.710]  Let's go.
[57:46.010 --> 57:46.550]  And you want me to heal you?
[57:46.730 --> 57:47.430]  Yeah, heal me, please.
[57:47.830 --> 57:48.290]  Okay, let's move.
[57:48.930 --> 57:50.470]  And then let's push into the reach.
[57:50.830 --> 57:52.310]  Just drop down and then deliver.
[57:53.150 --> 57:54.750]  Yeah, stop moving, stop moving.
[57:55.330 --> 57:56.010]  Tuck and roll.
[57:56.710 --> 57:56.990]  Good.
[57:56.990 --> 57:57.470]  Where do I drop it?
[57:57.570 --> 57:57.770]  Oh, here.
[57:57.830 --> 57:58.230]  Okay, thanks.
[57:58.530 --> 57:58.770]  Let's go.

[57:59.290 --> 57:59.610]  Got it.
[57:59.830 --> 58:00.350]  Let's get the rest from here.
[58:00.350 --> 58:00.690]  Three more.

[58:14.540 --> 58:15.080]  I got you.
[58:16.080 --> 58:16.520]  There you go.
[58:16.860 --> 58:17.120]  Bull.
[58:18.640 --> 58:19.260]  Oh, shit.
[58:19.620 --> 58:20.980]  What did I get taken down by?
[58:21.020 --> 58:21.460]  I'm down.
[58:21.700 --> 58:22.200]  I need a hand.
[58:22.220 --> 58:22.560]  Oh, shit.
[58:23.020 --> 58:23.560]  I got you.
[58:24.140 --> 58:24.780]  I'll be right there.
[58:24.860 --> 58:25.300]  Oh, you're okay.
[58:25.400 --> 58:25.720]  You're all right.
[58:25.740 --> 58:26.120]  You're back up.
[58:27.460 --> 58:28.560]  Hey, I need a hand.
[58:29.260 --> 58:29.600]  Yeah.

[58:31.140 --> 58:31.380]  Got you.
[58:33.220 --> 58:34.900]  As soon as I got up, I got knocked back down.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.060]  But then you got up again.
[58:37.600 --> 58:38.440]  Yeah, I didn't have a choice.

[58:42.300 --> 58:43.060]  Oh, are we reaching this?
[58:43.060 --> 58:43.940]  I'm delivering one of them.
[58:44.640 --> 58:45.860]  Oh, where are the other ones?
[58:45.960 --> 58:46.860]  Oh, you...
[58:46.860 --> 58:47.560]  Up the stairs.
[58:49.000 --> 58:49.860]  Andrew, do you need cover?
[58:50.360 --> 58:51.200]  Oh, I'm gonna get the screamer.
[58:51.200 --> 58:51.780]  Keep going down the hall.
[58:53.180 --> 58:54.120]  Are they just further?
[58:54.960 --> 58:56.300]  Yep, they're all the way down.
[58:57.000 --> 58:58.080]  Just keep going down.
[58:58.460 --> 58:58.820]  Okay.
[59:00.900 --> 59:01.560]  Take out that...
[59:01.560 --> 59:02.040]  What have we got?
[59:02.500 --> 59:03.200]  Oh, screamer.
[59:05.800 --> 59:07.720]  Oh, I got an achievement for that.
[59:07.800 --> 59:08.140]  That's cool.

[59:10.560 --> 59:11.160]  Okay, I see the last one.
[59:11.160 --> 59:11.440]  Oh, shit.

[59:14.680 --> 59:15.640]  Where's the last one?
[59:15.880 --> 59:17.000]  It's back at the subway station.
[59:17.740 --> 59:17.900]  Oh.
[59:18.940 --> 59:20.480]  Oh, I think I'm getting stinked.

[59:51.660 --> 59:52.040]  Thanks.
[59:52.600 --> 59:54.340]  I'm going to deliver the last supply crate.
[59:54.780 --> 59:56.620]  I went to a different set of supply crates.
[59:56.720 --> 59:58.040]  I didn't know there'd be another one over there.
[59:58.520 --> 59:59.260]  I'm trying, I'm trying.
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:00.340]  You get them?

[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.000]  Nice shot.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:04.920]  Four or five.

[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.480]  Perfect.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.160]  Can't believe we actually did it.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.940]  I'm pretty happy.

[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.320]  Damn, level...
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.760]  I can be a bounty hunter now.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.380]  Seven, Jesus.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.280]  Okay, well, Andrew, why don't you take us out?
