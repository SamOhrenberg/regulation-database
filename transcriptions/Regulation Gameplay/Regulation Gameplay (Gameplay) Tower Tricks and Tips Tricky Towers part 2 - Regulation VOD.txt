[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  Yeah, Nick, you can get a pass.
[00:02.000 --> 00:03.120]  Oh my God!
[00:03.960 --> 00:07.620]  Hey guys, what's up? It's Tricky Towers and this game is starting right now.
[00:07.880 --> 00:07.980]  What?
[00:08.400 --> 00:09.040]  Oh Christ!
[00:10.020 --> 00:10.960]  Yeah, it's the timer.
[00:11.420 --> 00:12.260]  This is what happens.
[00:13.320 --> 00:15.520]  I didn't get to play with you guys last week, so I'm not...
[00:15.520 --> 00:16.000]  Was it last week?
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  Oh, that's fine. You don't have to worry about it.
[00:17.020 --> 00:17.800]  It was two weeks ago.
[00:18.380 --> 00:18.800]  Two weeks ago?
[00:19.040 --> 00:19.600]  Hey, guess what?
[00:19.700 --> 00:19.900]  Yeah, it's fine.
[00:20.240 --> 00:22.880]  We were having a fun time figuring out how games work.
[00:23.600 --> 00:26.280]  Yeah, it's Tetris, but stuff can move.
[00:26.500 --> 00:28.260]  So, you're good, Geoff. I believe in you.
[00:29.240 --> 00:30.040]  Oh, fuck.
[00:30.580 --> 00:30.740]  Yeah.
[00:31.900 --> 00:32.700]  Oh, no.
[00:34.260 --> 00:36.300]  Can you, like, Tetris away?
[00:36.540 --> 00:37.720]  Can you, like, make a connection?
[00:37.940 --> 00:41.040]  No, what you're trying to do here is build up to, like, these lines.
[00:41.420 --> 00:44.500]  So that way you can get powers to fuck everyone else up.
[00:44.600 --> 00:45.060]  Oh, God.
[00:45.080 --> 00:46.160]  But at the same time...
[00:46.160 --> 00:46.620]  Uh-oh!
[00:47.020 --> 00:48.720]  You have to be careful not to drop a bunch of stuff!
[00:48.820 --> 00:49.420]  I'm eliminated.
[00:50.840 --> 00:52.360]  Oh, I forgot that's...
[00:52.360 --> 00:53.280]  Oh, fuck. Okay.
[00:54.960 --> 00:56.220]  Guys, welcome to the stream.
[00:56.220 --> 00:58.980]  We were gonna play Moving Out, and then guess what? It didn't work.
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.100]  What the fuck was that?
[01:00.100 --> 01:02.520]  We were also gonna play something else before that, and that didn't work.
[01:02.640 --> 01:03.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03.540 --> 01:04.040]  Oh, my God.
[01:04.040 --> 01:05.500]  It's been a cool 14 minutes.
[01:05.920 --> 01:07.040]  Why am I locked?
[01:07.540 --> 01:09.040]  Uh, you know, just, uh...
[01:09.040 --> 01:09.360]  Hold!
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.200]  You got fucked up.
[01:10.640 --> 01:12.440]  Andrew probably fucked you up. You should attack him.
[01:13.160 --> 01:14.260]  That wasn't me. I'm already dead.
[01:14.280 --> 01:14.760]  I'm wizard out.
[01:15.620 --> 01:16.000]  I'm dead as dicks.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.240]  Yeah, we were gonna play...
[01:17.240 --> 01:18.800]  What was that game called? Disney Bulletstorm?
[01:19.420 --> 01:19.780]  Moving...
[01:19.780 --> 01:20.060]  Oh.
[01:20.740 --> 01:22.360]  Yeah, Disney Bulletstorm.
[01:22.560 --> 01:23.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23.260 --> 01:25.140]  We were gonna play Disney Bulletstorm,
[01:25.140 --> 01:27.100]  and then now instead we're playing Tricky Towers,
[01:27.760 --> 01:28.940]  uh, because Gavin's not here,
[01:29.160 --> 01:34.320]  and, um, because Moving Out 2 wouldn't let Andrew join for the life of us.
[01:34.700 --> 01:34.900]  Nope.
[01:35.020 --> 01:37.760]  Moving Out 2 said enough's enough. Andrew already moved out.
[01:38.520 --> 01:43.200]  Okay, Geoff, now you're trying to get as many pieces here as you can without hitting the line.
[01:43.240 --> 01:43.640]  Oh, no.
[01:44.420 --> 01:44.840]  Oh, no.
[01:44.860 --> 01:45.480]  Without hitting the line.
[01:45.640 --> 01:49.260]  Okay, I was looking at where I was playing last time we did this,
[01:49.320 --> 01:50.100]  and that fucked me.
[01:50.640 --> 01:51.000]  Can't do that.
[01:51.000 --> 01:51.980]  I was looking at the wrong guy.
[01:52.080 --> 01:52.360]  God.
[01:52.460 --> 01:53.140]  Yeah, that happens.
[01:53.140 --> 01:54.220]  Dammit, fuck.
[01:54.340 --> 01:54.560]  Alright.
[01:56.220 --> 01:57.220]  Seems hard to do that.
[01:57.320 --> 01:57.900]  I'm having fun, guys.
[01:58.780 --> 01:59.700]  You having fun, Nick?
[01:59.760 --> 02:00.500]  I'm having a great time.
[02:01.500 --> 02:03.360]  I can't tell if that's...
[02:04.240 --> 02:04.560]  Yeah.
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.340]  If that's true or not.
[02:05.780 --> 02:06.100]  Well...
[02:06.100 --> 02:07.840]  Yeah, that's kinda how this game goes.
[02:08.540 --> 02:09.840]  Oh, I'm not even playing the game.
[02:10.260 --> 02:11.020]  Sit, sit, sit.
[02:11.380 --> 02:11.700]  Fuck!
[02:12.440 --> 02:13.660]  Are you trying to put...
[02:13.660 --> 02:14.980]  Are you trying to just put nameplates on?
[02:15.040 --> 02:15.180]  Yep.
[02:15.680 --> 02:16.540]  Just, uh, put nameplates in it.
[02:16.540 --> 02:18.320]  Why not? Just put some nameplates on, dude. You got it.
[02:18.620 --> 02:19.680]  Oh, keep up the good work, Nick.
[02:19.740 --> 02:21.060]  Oh, I gotta make it look nice?
[02:22.220 --> 02:22.660]  Fuck.
[02:23.580 --> 02:24.460]  Oh, goddammit.
[02:24.620 --> 02:24.960]  Oh my god.
[02:24.960 --> 02:25.240]  I blew it.
[02:25.760 --> 02:27.060]  There's hype in the chat.
[02:27.380 --> 02:28.220]  Fuck, what is the order?
[02:28.460 --> 02:28.520]  Shit.
[02:28.720 --> 02:29.060]  Level five.
[02:29.660 --> 02:30.900]  What? I'm on the left.
[02:31.640 --> 02:32.020]  Who's...
[02:32.020 --> 02:32.840]  Who's second?
[02:33.980 --> 02:34.460]  Oh, it's me.
[02:34.480 --> 02:35.580]  Like, who is the second person?
[02:35.800 --> 02:36.040]  That's me.
[02:36.260 --> 02:36.780]  I think it's Nick.
[02:37.260 --> 02:37.660]  Who's third?
[02:37.660 --> 02:38.420]  I'm player three.
[02:38.920 --> 02:40.100]  Geoff is player three.
[02:40.780 --> 02:41.700]  Andrew's player four.
[02:41.840 --> 02:42.020]  Okay.
[02:42.640 --> 02:43.680]  Geoff, Geoff.
[02:43.960 --> 02:45.700]  Why did you answer at all?
[02:46.040 --> 02:47.980]  Because I could tell nobody was moving.
[02:48.260 --> 02:50.680]  I could tell the character wasn't moving, so it was clearly Nick.
[02:52.160 --> 02:52.800]  Thank you.
[02:53.440 --> 02:54.840]  I feel like you said me first.
[02:54.980 --> 02:56.700]  I think there's a misunderstanding of who...
[02:56.700 --> 02:57.000]  Oh, did I?
[02:57.640 --> 03:02.760]  Yeah, you like initially gave who had the most blocks in the sequence of places.
[03:03.620 --> 03:05.940]  But I will say, I think that's what happens when you're a parent.
[03:06.040 --> 03:10.300]  You become a parent, and then you don't name the person you're trying to talk to.
[03:10.580 --> 03:14.840]  You just say a bunch of different names until it lands on the person you're trying to talk to.
[03:15.120 --> 03:16.400]  That is kind of how it goes.
[03:16.940 --> 03:17.700]  He nailed it.
[03:17.980 --> 03:19.700]  So, how you feeling about it, Nick?
[03:20.220 --> 03:20.540]  Great.
[03:21.500 --> 03:22.480]  Are you going to win now?
[03:22.780 --> 03:24.120]  Are you not able to get it, or what?
[03:24.420 --> 03:24.860]  Oh my...
[03:24.860 --> 03:27.220]  Oh, I got it. I just got it. Export. Hold on. Let's see.
[03:27.300 --> 03:30.320]  I got to get rid of it, because I have to position them so they're on the...
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.840]  I fucking undid that.
[03:33.180 --> 03:35.480]  Look at that. Nick didn't even get any blocks on this thing.
[03:35.600 --> 03:36.080]  Hell yeah.
[03:36.960 --> 03:38.260]  Alright. Export.
[03:40.100 --> 03:40.720]  I win.
[03:41.540 --> 03:43.420]  You guys champion right here. This is easy mode.
[03:44.780 --> 03:45.100]  Export.
[03:46.200 --> 03:46.520]  Uh-huh.
[03:47.300 --> 03:47.860]  You just hit export?
[03:48.400 --> 03:48.960]  Yeah, I just hit export.
[03:48.960 --> 03:49.820]  Hurry up!
[03:49.960 --> 03:50.540]  Alright, there we go.
[03:52.480 --> 03:54.040]  Alright, what's this one? Race normal.
[03:54.460 --> 03:58.420]  Uh, you are trying to make it to the... you're just trying to build as high as you can.
[03:58.540 --> 04:01.180]  Stuff can fall, and it doesn't penalize you.
[04:01.480 --> 04:04.260]  So, you can just... you're just trying to build as high as you can.
[04:05.000 --> 04:05.520]  That's it.
[04:07.100 --> 04:10.500]  You're trying to get to that, uh, the top race line.
[04:10.660 --> 04:11.580]  And then you win, baby.
[04:12.780 --> 04:14.100]  So, just first to the top?
[04:14.500 --> 04:16.300]  Yeah, yeah. First to the very top.
[04:16.300 --> 04:20.120]  And again, we're gonna fuck each other, because that's what this game is.
[04:20.660 --> 04:22.940]  And, um, you'll see as you get...
[04:22.940 --> 04:26.940]  As you reach, like, the lines that are sort of in between, like, these little, like, diamonds,
[04:27.400 --> 04:29.820]  you'll get a power that you're able to do.
[04:30.140 --> 04:32.840]  There are two powers that you're able to get.
[04:33.220 --> 04:34.860]  The X benefits you.
[04:35.980 --> 04:40.360]  The... and the B will fuck up other people, I think is how it works.
[04:40.380 --> 04:41.000]  Alright, here we go.
[04:42.080 --> 04:43.140]  Yep, there, it's for you guys.
[04:43.140 --> 04:45.240]  Oh, no! Oh, no! Big block!
[04:45.240 --> 04:46.040]  Enjoy, fellas.
[04:46.140 --> 04:47.540]  Oh, no! No!
[04:47.860 --> 04:48.220]  Big block.
[04:49.160 --> 04:51.940]  Yeah, the big block... the big block sometimes will help you.
[04:52.120 --> 04:53.300]  Mostly, it will not help you.
[04:53.380 --> 04:54.160]  Mostly, it'll screw you.
[04:54.740 --> 04:56.400]  Yeah, big... big block, mostly bad.
[04:56.720 --> 04:58.280]  Big block, do bad.
[04:58.760 --> 05:00.900]  Yeah, big block hard. Yeah, big block hard.
[05:01.200 --> 05:03.340]  You'll... you'll learn this pretty quick, though, Geoff.
[05:03.420 --> 05:05.300]  Like, what... what works for you, what doesn't.
[05:05.380 --> 05:06.780]  And then, how to build.
[05:06.940 --> 05:10.020]  I trust you. I feel like your brain is wired for something like this.
[05:10.140 --> 05:10.420]  Hell yeah.
[05:10.420 --> 05:11.220]  So, I think you're gonna do it.
[05:11.220 --> 05:11.580]  That didn't work.
[05:11.940 --> 05:12.280]  Nope!
[05:13.360 --> 05:14.380]  Ooh, ice.
[05:14.400 --> 05:14.840]  Okay, fine.
[05:15.460 --> 05:15.920]  Fuck you.
[05:16.360 --> 05:16.940]  Oh, no, the balloon!
[05:17.220 --> 05:17.580]  Fuck off.
[05:18.140 --> 05:19.100]  What is happening?
[05:19.880 --> 05:20.600]  What's the...
[05:21.520 --> 05:22.260]  What's the...
[05:22.260 --> 05:23.340]  Fuckin' slow-ass balloon.
[05:25.200 --> 05:26.500]  I didn't mean to do that.
[05:26.680 --> 05:26.800]  What does that do?
[05:26.840 --> 05:28.320]  Well, sometimes... sometimes you panic.
[05:28.860 --> 05:30.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it happens a lot.
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.000]  Happens a lot.
[05:32.860 --> 05:33.160]  Uh-oh.
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.000]  Oh, no.
[05:34.300 --> 05:34.900]  Oh, God, no.
[05:35.320 --> 05:36.280]  Oh, dear God, no.
[05:36.560 --> 05:36.940]  Oh, no!
[05:37.380 --> 05:37.960]  Oh, no.
[05:37.960 --> 05:39.160]  Oh, did your whole tower just fall?
[05:39.240 --> 05:40.080]  That happens a lot, too.
[05:40.080 --> 05:40.480]  Oh, no.
[05:40.480 --> 05:41.260]  No, my ice!
[05:41.400 --> 05:41.780]  That was my first time.
[05:42.660 --> 05:42.820]  Yeah.
[05:43.040 --> 05:44.440]  I was building a pretty solid tower until that moment.
[05:44.440 --> 05:47.600]  Yeah, you think you are, and then you aren't.
[05:47.860 --> 05:48.400]  Have a balloon.
[05:48.420 --> 05:48.620]  Yeah.
[05:49.380 --> 05:49.860]  No!
[05:50.700 --> 05:51.740]  Piece of shit.
[05:52.520 --> 05:52.940]  No!
[05:54.680 --> 05:55.620]  There we go.
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.140]  No, no, no, no, no!
[05:57.320 --> 05:58.140]  Not ice!
[05:58.300 --> 05:59.020]  Oh, fuck.
[05:59.100 --> 05:59.780]  Not ice.
[06:00.600 --> 06:00.880]  God.
[06:01.120 --> 06:02.500]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[06:02.840 --> 06:03.080]  No!
[06:03.400 --> 06:04.680]  Has anybody tried this tactic?
[06:04.880 --> 06:06.540]  Well, I'm just gonna kill from here.
[06:08.660 --> 06:09.140]  Ugh.
[06:12.080 --> 06:12.820]  No, no, no.
[06:13.040 --> 06:13.400]  Fuck.
[06:13.840 --> 06:16.960]  Somehow, I've come all the way back into first, second, first, second.
[06:16.960 --> 06:19.260]  Dude, these ice pieces are so rough.
[06:20.000 --> 06:20.220]  No.
[06:20.600 --> 06:20.960]  No.
[06:21.400 --> 06:22.080]  I must win.
[06:22.420 --> 06:22.480]  Oh, my God.
[06:22.580 --> 06:23.380]  No, don't do it.
[06:23.540 --> 06:24.840]  Uh-oh, this is bad.
[06:25.280 --> 06:25.560]  Hold.
[06:26.280 --> 06:26.640]  Hold.
[06:27.320 --> 06:27.680]  Hold.
[06:27.880 --> 06:28.000]  Hold.
[06:28.000 --> 06:28.280]  No!
[06:28.580 --> 06:29.760]  Other way, other way, other way!
[06:30.420 --> 06:30.660]  No!
[06:32.600 --> 06:34.100]  Nick, I watched it happen.
[06:35.820 --> 06:36.740]  Yeah, me too, man.
[06:37.980 --> 06:38.880]  Oh, God damn it.
[06:39.020 --> 06:39.560]  I'm just fucked.
[06:39.560 --> 06:40.200]  I'm just fucked.
[06:40.200 --> 06:40.680]  No!
[06:41.480 --> 06:43.220]  Not the balloon, my whole tower!
[06:44.580 --> 06:46.860]  The balloon took your whole tower?
[06:47.320 --> 06:47.800]  Yes.
[06:48.220 --> 06:51.540]  I was about to lay my piece down, and then it didn't let me.
[06:53.720 --> 06:54.240]  Oh, my balls.
[06:54.240 --> 06:54.600]  No!
[06:56.520 --> 06:57.000]  No!
[06:57.380 --> 06:57.900]  You got it.
[06:58.740 --> 07:00.740]  Three, two, one!
[07:01.160 --> 07:01.860]  Did you get it?
[07:02.080 --> 07:02.560]  Yeah!
[07:03.680 --> 07:04.900]  God damn it.
[07:05.360 --> 07:05.840]  Balls.
[07:06.660 --> 07:07.060]  Oh!
[07:08.660 --> 07:09.460]  All right.
[07:09.620 --> 07:10.840]  Little side house.
[07:11.340 --> 07:12.340]  God damn it.
[07:12.820 --> 07:16.000]  Hey, everybody's saying my audio is significantly lower than everyone else.
[07:16.120 --> 07:16.600]  I got you.
[07:18.960 --> 07:19.680]  Oh, man.
[07:20.380 --> 07:20.500]  Okay.
[07:20.780 --> 07:21.080]  Puzzle.
[07:21.200 --> 07:21.740]  Keep talking, Geoff, for a sec.
[07:22.460 --> 07:23.220]  Hey, what's up?
[07:23.240 --> 07:23.640]  This is Geoff.
[07:23.660 --> 07:24.720]  I'm gonna keep talking for a sec.
[07:24.740 --> 07:25.180]  What's this one?
[07:25.860 --> 07:26.640]  This is the same one.
[07:26.740 --> 07:27.880]  It's that build that tower.
[07:27.980 --> 07:28.540]  Okay, you should do that.
[07:28.540 --> 07:34.120]  Like, as many pieces as you can without it falling off or hitting that line.
[07:35.300 --> 07:35.700]  Okay.
[07:40.030 --> 07:41.530]  What is Nick doing?
[07:42.250 --> 07:42.770]  He's whispering.
[07:43.370 --> 07:43.410]  Yeah.
[07:43.530 --> 07:44.130]  I don't like it.
[07:44.550 --> 07:47.390]  Can we make a no-whisper rule for Nick, specifically?
[07:47.810 --> 07:48.630]  That's up to him.
[07:49.350 --> 07:49.630]  You know what?
[07:49.790 --> 07:51.750]  We don't have anything to do with a no-whisper rule.
[07:51.910 --> 07:52.510]  That's up to Nick.
[07:52.850 --> 07:52.930]  Yeah.
[07:52.930 --> 07:52.990]  Yeah.
[07:54.790 --> 07:57.610]  Nick, you should consider adopting a no-whisper policy.
[07:58.950 --> 07:59.350]  Yeah!
[07:59.910 --> 08:00.290]  Yeah.
[08:00.710 --> 08:01.170]  Yeah, see?
[08:01.210 --> 08:01.430]  Yeah.
[08:05.290 --> 08:06.590]  Oh, dude, I'm winning this one.
[08:06.590 --> 08:07.530]  You guys are so fucked.
[08:08.350 --> 08:09.070]  Oh, fuck.
[08:09.270 --> 08:10.190]  It's already mine, baby.
[08:10.550 --> 08:10.790]  Shit, dude.
[08:10.930 --> 08:11.550]  This is so easy.
[08:12.070 --> 08:13.090]  It's already mine.
[08:13.430 --> 08:14.290]  Wow, you're doing awesome.
[08:14.470 --> 08:17.470]  I gotta start thinking bigger.
[08:18.150 --> 08:18.490]  That's cool.
[08:19.370 --> 08:20.670]  I'm gonna take it.
[08:20.690 --> 08:21.310]  I'm gonna take it here.
[08:21.370 --> 08:22.230]  I think I got it.
[08:22.710 --> 08:23.690]  I think I got it.
[08:24.950 --> 08:30.610]  Again, I'm not puzzle-brained, but there's something about this where it makes sense to me.
[08:30.710 --> 08:31.710]  And I couldn't tell you why.
[08:32.210 --> 08:34.130]  I think it's pretty clear that you're the puzzle guy.
[08:34.850 --> 08:35.210]  No!
[08:35.210 --> 08:36.730]  Andrew, why did you do that?
[08:36.950 --> 08:37.650]  I don't like that.
[08:37.790 --> 08:38.830]  I don't like what I just did.
[08:39.250 --> 08:44.630]  So as soon as you touch the line here, and Geoff, if you don't get this piece in, it's gonna move your shit up.
[08:45.010 --> 08:46.050]  That's Nick, not me.
[08:46.070 --> 08:46.190]  That's me.
[08:46.510 --> 08:47.490]  Oh, that's Nick?
[08:47.610 --> 08:48.410]  Oh, that's right.
[08:49.090 --> 08:50.410]  Someone told me it was Geoff.
[08:50.590 --> 08:51.330]  Nick's squeezing it.
[08:51.510 --> 08:52.890]  Oh my god, thank you for all the subs.
[08:53.190 --> 08:53.790]  Oh, thank you.
[08:53.930 --> 08:54.330]  Whoa!
[08:54.890 --> 08:55.050]  Wow!
[08:56.030 --> 08:58.490]  M. Nudestrup, thank you so much.
[08:58.650 --> 09:01.170]  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, thirteen.
[09:02.390 --> 09:03.970]  Nick, congratulations on second place.
[09:03.970 --> 09:05.370]  That must feel so good for you.
[09:05.470 --> 09:07.870]  Well, after putting the nameplates on, not too shabby.
[09:08.130 --> 09:09.270]  You did pretty good, man!
[09:09.490 --> 09:10.970]  Look, and I'm in the race!
[09:11.570 --> 09:12.350]  You're doing great.
[09:12.630 --> 09:15.470]  We're playing first to twelve for this first game.
[09:15.750 --> 09:15.970]  Sweet.
[09:16.410 --> 09:17.650]  It's fine, I'm gonna win this one.
[09:17.950 --> 09:20.370]  Okay, so Geoff, this is survival.
[09:20.570 --> 09:22.490]  This is the first, I think it's the first one that we played.
[09:22.710 --> 09:23.990]  You only have three hearts.
[09:24.550 --> 09:27.510]  If you drop a piece, you lose a heart.
[09:27.830 --> 09:29.650]  That is, and you only have three.
[09:30.070 --> 09:32.890]  Do I get a power-up if I make it to the top or something?
[09:32.890 --> 09:35.350]  You get a power-up when you get to those diamonds, yeah.
[09:37.710 --> 09:39.950]  I don't know if I like that, but I'm gonna go with it.
[09:41.470 --> 09:42.250]  This is fun.
[09:43.270 --> 09:44.310]  It's a fun game.
[09:44.410 --> 09:44.910]  It's a great game.
[09:44.910 --> 09:46.390]  It was fun to play with Gavin.
[09:46.790 --> 09:46.950]  Yeah.
[09:47.270 --> 09:48.250]  Oh, he's so bad at it.
[09:48.410 --> 09:48.530]  Yeah.
[09:48.530 --> 09:50.790]  He was so bad at it, it was unbelievable.
[09:51.990 --> 09:52.430]  I believe it.
[09:52.450 --> 09:54.370]  He's not a big...
[09:54.890 --> 09:55.350]  It's interesting.
[09:55.530 --> 09:57.090]  Are you gonna say puzzle guy?
[09:57.650 --> 09:58.790]  I was gonna say patience guy.
[09:59.190 --> 10:00.270]  Oh, that makes sense.
[10:02.890 --> 10:03.990]  Hey, check that out.
[10:04.090 --> 10:05.770]  That is no bueno.
[10:05.890 --> 10:06.770]  Just a little bit bigger.
[10:07.270 --> 10:09.930]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:10.090 --> 10:10.510]  No, that's no.
[10:10.510 --> 10:11.710]  I thought you'd like that.
[10:11.710 --> 10:12.450]  No, this is horseshoe.
[10:12.450 --> 10:13.590]  Why don't you like that?
[10:13.830 --> 10:14.870]  Why did it do that?
[10:14.890 --> 10:16.530]  I thought it was nice for you.
[10:16.890 --> 10:17.970]  I didn't have a good time at all.
[10:18.110 --> 10:19.050]  Did you not like that?
[10:19.450 --> 10:19.710]  No.
[10:20.250 --> 10:21.170]  Surprisingly, no.
[10:21.990 --> 10:22.350]  What?
[10:22.550 --> 10:22.710]  What?
[10:22.710 --> 10:23.530]  Is it windy in this?
[10:23.610 --> 10:23.870]  What's happening?
[10:23.870 --> 10:24.450]  Stop laying...
[10:24.450 --> 10:25.370]  No, you dick.
[10:26.790 --> 10:27.510]  Oh, Christ.
[10:30.130 --> 10:30.490]  Sloan's...
[10:30.490 --> 10:31.730]  Oh, Nick, no, no.
[10:31.730 --> 10:32.910]  Oh, no!
[10:34.450 --> 10:34.750]  I'm dead.
[10:36.710 --> 10:37.510]  Weasel turd.
[10:37.670 --> 10:38.570]  Yeah, but what about that?
[10:39.370 --> 10:40.010]  Did that help?
[10:40.070 --> 10:40.570]  Nah, it's fine.
[10:41.030 --> 10:41.650]  Yeah, I liked that.
[10:41.930 --> 10:42.650]  Oh, shit.
[10:42.910 --> 10:43.310]  No, I didn't!
[10:43.530 --> 10:45.130]  Andrew actually likes that.
[10:45.330 --> 10:45.890]  Oh, what the...
[10:46.530 --> 10:48.910]  Get away, you little freaks.
[10:50.630 --> 10:51.030]  No!
[10:51.670 --> 10:53.930]  Oh, my God, that fucking is so bad.
[10:54.070 --> 10:55.170]  How do I close out his slack?
[10:56.530 --> 10:58.810]  How do I close out his slack?
[10:59.550 --> 11:00.470]  Nick's gotta pay attention.
[11:00.470 --> 11:02.150]  He's like, it's just getting too serious.
[11:02.250 --> 11:04.370]  No, I realized, I was like, wait a minute.
[11:04.530 --> 11:06.950]  If I get a slack message at all, it will go on the stream.
[11:07.690 --> 11:07.910]  Yes.
[11:09.290 --> 11:09.930]  Oh, no.
[11:11.190 --> 11:11.550]  No!
[11:12.710 --> 11:13.070]  Yes!
[11:13.590 --> 11:14.330]  I knew it.
[11:14.410 --> 11:15.570]  I knew I just had to outlast.
[11:15.690 --> 11:16.850]  Wow, guys, I got another achievement.
[11:16.970 --> 11:18.690]  It's called Close Call, and Eric wins again.
[11:21.590 --> 11:25.210]  Do you guys think I was born good at this game, or it's something I learned?
[11:26.010 --> 11:26.950]  You're not winning again.
[11:27.090 --> 11:28.490]  You're not winning again this stream.
[11:28.510 --> 11:28.870]  That's it.
[11:28.870 --> 11:29.250]  Yep.
[11:29.410 --> 11:30.310]  Now that I'm back in, I'm in.
[11:30.310 --> 11:31.110]  This is getting serious.
[11:31.710 --> 11:31.950]  Okay.
[11:32.450 --> 11:35.430]  I got one fourth place and 12 first places.
[11:35.970 --> 11:39.130]  I'll make it my business to make sure if I lose, you lose.
[11:39.710 --> 11:41.150]  Well, you take care of that big cup.
[11:41.550 --> 11:43.370]  I'll make it my business.
[11:44.810 --> 11:45.430]  Oh, man.
[11:45.990 --> 11:46.370]  Let's go.
[11:46.550 --> 11:47.130]  I'm ready.
[11:47.610 --> 11:48.710]  Let's do this shit.
[11:49.830 --> 11:50.670]  Yeah, let's do it.
[11:50.830 --> 11:52.370]  Guys, thanks so much for watching.
[11:52.450 --> 11:53.590]  This VOD will be up on Tuesday.
[11:53.770 --> 11:56.470]  If you're watching the VOD, we stream every Friday at 4 p.m. Central.
[11:56.470 --> 11:57.970]  We're going to be snuffing out rats.
[11:58.230 --> 11:59.170]  That's 2 p.m. Pacific and 5 p.m. Eastern.
[11:59.850 --> 12:00.810]  Can't be that hard to figure out.
[12:01.410 --> 12:02.870]  We're going to be snuffing out rats all day.
[12:03.510 --> 12:04.290]  Oh, my God.
[12:05.230 --> 12:07.470]  What is the, uh...
[12:07.470 --> 12:09.190]  The vine power?
[12:09.470 --> 12:09.910]  Yeah.
[12:10.470 --> 12:16.190]  So what it does is make whatever it touches kind of turn into one piece.
[12:16.370 --> 12:19.890]  So you are able to, like, hang more stuff, put more things.
[12:20.050 --> 12:22.670]  Like, that kind of, I think, is the point.
[12:24.650 --> 12:25.130]  Oh.
[12:25.130 --> 12:25.890]  This is...
[12:25.890 --> 12:26.210]  Yeah.
[12:27.570 --> 12:30.850]  I don't know if I like what I did there, but I'll live with my decision.
[12:30.890 --> 12:33.170]  Is this the same one where we're just trying to get as many pieces on as we can?
[12:33.390 --> 12:33.510]  Yes. Yeah.
[12:33.710 --> 12:33.850]  Yeah.
[12:34.050 --> 12:39.630]  And we can throw pieces away if we don't like them?
[12:39.730 --> 12:40.010]  No.
[12:40.250 --> 12:42.090]  No, that moves your thing up.
[12:42.090 --> 12:42.230]  Sorry.
[12:42.790 --> 12:43.830]  That will kill you.
[12:44.010 --> 12:44.250]  Yeah.
[12:44.430 --> 12:47.410]  That'll move your thing up and closer to the ending.
[12:47.690 --> 12:48.630]  Oh, that sucked.
[12:48.850 --> 12:49.470]  That's a good idea.
[12:49.990 --> 12:50.870]  Yes, anchor.
[12:53.590 --> 12:54.250]  Please fit.
[12:54.350 --> 12:54.750]  Please fit.
[12:54.830 --> 12:55.270]  Please fit.
[12:55.350 --> 12:55.750]  Please fit.
[12:55.890 --> 12:56.310]  Please fit.
[12:56.370 --> 12:56.550]  Damn it.
[12:56.770 --> 12:57.990]  I wanted it too bad.
[12:58.130 --> 12:58.490]  Damn.
[12:59.190 --> 12:59.810]  Damn, damn, damn.
[12:59.810 --> 13:00.070]  Wait, wait.
[13:00.110 --> 13:00.990]  That'll work right there.
[13:01.130 --> 13:01.370]  Maybe?
[13:02.030 --> 13:02.390]  Yeah.
[13:03.490 --> 13:06.070]  Okay, I think I'm going to take my lumps and I'm going to call it here.
[13:06.430 --> 13:07.470]  We're going to do that.
[13:07.670 --> 13:07.850]  Okay.
[13:07.970 --> 13:08.490]  We'll see how we did.
[13:08.570 --> 13:09.930]  I think Nick has this one, though.
[13:10.450 --> 13:10.630]  Yeah.
[13:10.690 --> 13:12.330]  Nick is no wasted space.
[13:12.450 --> 13:13.210]  That is super tight.
[13:13.210 --> 13:13.390]  I'm not going to lose that.
[13:13.710 --> 13:13.990]  Woo!
[13:14.190 --> 13:15.250]  That's really good, Nick.
[13:15.370 --> 13:15.490]  Way to go.
[13:15.490 --> 13:15.930]  Thank you, man.
[13:16.270 --> 13:17.530]  I think you might have me beat, though.
[13:18.590 --> 13:19.570]  No, mine's higher.
[13:19.570 --> 13:21.130]  I had a piece fall.
[13:21.270 --> 13:21.750]  Mine's higher.
[13:21.910 --> 13:22.970]  Yours is...
[13:22.970 --> 13:26.390]  Yeah, I think you're going to beat me by one, maybe two.
[13:28.150 --> 13:29.130]  See how Andrew does.
[13:29.250 --> 13:29.710]  It's going to be close.
[13:30.090 --> 13:33.950]  I think I have an idea about what Andrew is going to do.
[13:34.750 --> 13:35.430]  He's got it.
[13:36.550 --> 13:37.830]  I had a pretty decent tower.
[13:37.910 --> 13:38.270]  It's pretty good.
[13:38.390 --> 13:38.850]  Yeah, it's good.
[13:39.190 --> 13:39.570]  It's good.
[13:39.730 --> 13:40.510]  Yeah, yeah, it's good.
[13:41.050 --> 13:41.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:42.270 --> 13:44.250]  I mean, it's good for third place.
[13:44.890 --> 13:47.570]  I like that Eric conceded this one to me and still won.
[13:48.050 --> 13:49.310]  I thought that you had it.
[13:49.310 --> 13:51.290]  It looks like you have a better tower than me.
[13:51.590 --> 13:52.450]  Turns out...
[13:52.450 --> 13:53.870]  I'm like a girth guy.
[13:54.530 --> 13:56.490]  They call that the Eric combo brag.
[13:56.870 --> 13:57.270]  Yeah, it's like...
[13:57.270 --> 13:58.630]  He's like, no, I won't win.
[13:58.750 --> 13:59.690]  I didn't think so.
[13:59.870 --> 14:00.490]  You ain't getting this one.
[14:08.550 --> 14:10.430]  Turns out you are a shower.
[14:11.190 --> 14:11.950]  Don't love that.
[14:14.990 --> 14:16.670]  No, with this tower, man, I'm a grower.
[14:17.530 --> 14:19.210]  I'm growing this thing all the way to the moon, baby.
[14:19.230 --> 14:19.790]  Excellent, yeah.
[14:19.790 --> 14:20.550]  Yeah.
[14:22.890 --> 14:23.790]  Is that the goal?
[14:23.890 --> 14:24.570]  This one go tall?
[14:25.370 --> 14:25.530]  Yeah.
[14:25.690 --> 14:28.870]  This one is to outlast because you only have the three lives.
[14:29.850 --> 14:30.630]  Ah, alright.
[14:30.810 --> 14:30.930]  Yeah.
[14:31.550 --> 14:33.070]  And again, you're trying to...
[14:33.070 --> 14:36.950]  You're just trying to fuck everybody and see if there's a power that you can get that is
[14:36.950 --> 14:38.090]  going to benefit you somehow.
[14:38.710 --> 14:39.970]  How did those almost fall?
[14:44.210 --> 14:45.090]  Oh, God.
[14:45.210 --> 14:45.650]  Whoa!
[14:46.430 --> 14:47.370]  What the fuck?
[14:47.890 --> 14:48.630]  What was that?
[14:50.230 --> 14:50.590]  Yeah.
[14:50.710 --> 14:51.790]  Why did that happen?
[14:51.990 --> 14:52.350]  Ah!
[14:52.390 --> 14:53.090]  Oh, this could work.
[14:54.450 --> 14:55.890]  Guys, that didn't work for ol' Eric.
[14:56.830 --> 14:57.890]  Oh, ol' Eric.
[14:59.450 --> 15:00.070]  Oh, shit.
[15:00.110 --> 15:00.670]  I fucked that up.
[15:00.690 --> 15:01.390]  Oh, I wonder if I could...
[15:01.390 --> 15:02.910]  I also fucked that up.
[15:03.890 --> 15:04.250]  Why?
[15:04.430 --> 15:04.710]  Why?
[15:04.830 --> 15:05.110]  Why?
[15:05.250 --> 15:05.550]  Why?
[15:05.710 --> 15:06.490]  No, don't do that.
[15:07.250 --> 15:07.590]  No.
[15:07.870 --> 15:08.350]  Oh, that'll work.
[15:08.350 --> 15:08.370]  That's great.
[15:08.370 --> 15:09.670]  I see why Gavin hates this game.
[15:10.130 --> 15:10.350]  Yeah.
[15:10.610 --> 15:10.870]  No!
[15:10.870 --> 15:11.390]  Oh, shit.
[15:11.590 --> 15:12.090]  Guys, I'm out.
[15:12.490 --> 15:13.010]  Oh, dear.
[15:14.030 --> 15:14.770]  Oh, it's going fast.
[15:14.770 --> 15:15.970]  Oh, it's going fast.
[15:16.350 --> 15:17.270]  Nick, hold tough!
[15:18.270 --> 15:20.810]  Dude, Nick, Nick had full hearts.
[15:21.170 --> 15:23.010]  Nick won with full hearts.
[15:23.290 --> 15:24.470]  Oh, can't lose.
[15:25.370 --> 15:25.770]  Dude.
[15:28.130 --> 15:30.730]  Aljo Mayer, thank you so much for the subs.
[15:31.650 --> 15:33.610]  Thanks for everyone who's subscribing to this.
[15:33.750 --> 15:35.890]  And check out Regulatrion.com.
[15:37.770 --> 15:38.610]  Let's go Nick.
[15:39.090 --> 15:39.570]  Yay.
[15:39.570 --> 15:44.510]  Hey, uh, next week I'm thinking about, uh, streaming on an off night on here.
[15:45.350 --> 15:46.210]  Oh yeah?
[15:46.510 --> 15:46.730]  Yeah!
[15:47.310 --> 15:48.330]  What are you doing?
[15:49.190 --> 15:52.310]  Doing some, uh, hard mode for Last of Us, the hardest setting.
[15:52.490 --> 15:54.110]  Oh, that's a good idea!
[15:54.970 --> 15:56.070]  From the regulation account?
[15:56.290 --> 15:56.670]  Yeah!
[15:57.310 --> 15:58.770]  That's a regulation idea right there.
[15:58.890 --> 16:06.370]  I know that, uh, Geoff started streaming not too long ago, uh, on your fake Geoff channel,
[16:06.370 --> 16:09.730]  and you are, uh, you're playing all the PlayStation games.
[16:10.010 --> 16:11.210]  Yeah, but don't tell anybody, that's a secret.
[16:11.550 --> 16:11.950]  Oh, whoops.
[16:11.970 --> 16:14.570]  Oh, okay, cool. Alright. Well, you're playing all the PlayStation games secretly.
[16:14.950 --> 16:15.770]  But don't tell anybody!
[16:16.290 --> 16:16.610]  Okay.
[16:18.030 --> 16:19.510]  Yeah, I am, I have been playing.
[16:20.210 --> 16:21.850]  Except for today, today I played No Man's Sky.
[16:22.470 --> 16:22.770]  Oh, that's cool.
[16:22.770 --> 16:23.170]  Oh, how was that?
[16:24.070 --> 16:28.370]  It was good, I was just filming, uh, I was just filming backgrounds for you, Nick.
[16:28.650 --> 16:29.230]  Oh, thanks man!
[16:29.630 --> 16:36.070]  Dude, I found some great ones, I was playing around, uh, in Spider-Man 2.
[16:36.810 --> 16:37.710]  I found a nice spot.
[16:37.730 --> 16:37.890]  Oh, yeah?
[16:38.590 --> 16:39.230]  And, uh...
[16:39.230 --> 16:39.870]  That's so stupid.
[16:39.930 --> 16:43.370]  A few of them, actually. Like you said, it's kind of like cheating the camera a little bit.
[16:44.150 --> 16:44.270]  Yeah.
[16:44.690 --> 16:46.950]  And then I found some, actually, in Last of Us 2.
[16:47.490 --> 16:47.810]  Insane.
[16:49.630 --> 16:50.450]  So, I'm curious.
[16:50.470 --> 16:52.330]  You found some good stuff in Last of Us 2? That's cool.
[16:52.570 --> 16:52.750]  Yeah.
[16:52.810 --> 16:54.010]  Have you recorded, are you recording them?
[16:54.270 --> 16:55.510]  Not yet, but I'm going to.
[16:55.710 --> 16:55.830]  How about the balloon?
[16:56.450 --> 16:57.550]  You piece of fucking...
[16:57.550 --> 16:58.290]  I don't want the balloon.
[16:58.290 --> 17:00.470]  I want you guys to have the balloon.
[17:00.710 --> 17:02.290]  No! I don't want the balloon!
[17:02.710 --> 17:02.850]  Stop!
[17:03.490 --> 17:04.590]  Too many balloons!
[17:06.670 --> 17:08.030]  Let's see how you like it.
[17:08.270 --> 17:09.490]  I don't like it!
[17:10.790 --> 17:12.230]  Oh, why did I do that?
[17:12.530 --> 17:14.150]  There's no hope from this.
[17:14.470 --> 17:15.730]  I don't like the balloon!
[17:15.930 --> 17:17.210]  There is nothing, but... goodbye.
[17:17.730 --> 17:17.950]  Goodbye.
[17:18.450 --> 17:18.630]  Goodbye.
[17:19.250 --> 17:23.070]  To be fair, most of my streams are just me telling people, tune into regulation.
[17:23.590 --> 17:23.990]  Yeah.
[17:26.350 --> 17:29.650]  I've been streaming on my Twitch channel.
[17:29.730 --> 17:33.170]  I've just been trying to play WWE 2K24.
[17:33.670 --> 17:34.730]  And you're having a lot of fun with it.
[17:34.730 --> 17:35.210]  Oh yeah, is it fun?
[17:35.290 --> 17:38.190]  God damn, does it not want you to play a game with friends?
[17:39.330 --> 17:40.290]  It's hell on earth.
[17:41.070 --> 17:41.910]  You would think it would.
[17:42.030 --> 17:42.690]  Stop with the balloons!
[17:42.690 --> 17:43.830]  You would think it would, but it doesn't.
[17:44.170 --> 17:45.410]  No! My tower!
[17:48.370 --> 17:50.210]  Oh, this is all house stacking.
[17:50.230 --> 17:50.950]  Oh, I'm so wobbly!
[17:51.110 --> 17:52.730]  Andrew's in first place.
[17:52.830 --> 17:53.950]  I'm so wobbly!
[17:54.450 --> 17:56.310]  What the fuck is going on?
[17:56.350 --> 17:57.830]  Oh, this is so bad. Come on.
[17:59.390 --> 18:00.190]  No! No!
[18:00.750 --> 18:02.070]  Yes, Andrew, yes!
[18:03.210 --> 18:03.830]  I'm Nick.
[18:04.830 --> 18:06.090]  I know, I'm watching Andrew.
[18:06.370 --> 18:06.750]  Are you sure?
[18:06.850 --> 18:09.590]  Why is fucking anti-gravity happening? What was that about?
[18:12.330 --> 18:12.730]  No!
[18:17.090 --> 18:21.310]  I don't know what to do because half of my tower, if I put any weight on it, it's gonna fall.
[18:21.490 --> 18:22.150]  It's just done, yeah.
[18:22.150 --> 18:23.970]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[18:25.210 --> 18:28.270]  Oh, yes, I need that.
[18:28.310 --> 18:29.290]  Three, two, one!
[18:29.290 --> 18:30.390]  No, Andrew did it!
[18:30.530 --> 18:30.830]  No!
[18:31.650 --> 18:34.270]  Dammit, I was right there, I was at the finish line!
[18:35.430 --> 18:35.530]  Fuck!
[18:37.250 --> 18:39.670]  You guys need to start using powers, goddammit.
[18:40.490 --> 18:41.890]  I used them, but poorly.
[18:42.270 --> 18:43.710]  Yeah, I also played it wrong.
[18:45.430 --> 18:46.210]  Oh, look at that.
[18:46.590 --> 18:49.270]  Three-way race, Geoff is still in this thing.
[18:49.950 --> 18:50.350]  Hell yeah.
[18:53.710 --> 18:55.450]  You ain't getting this puzzle shit.
[18:55.510 --> 18:56.930]  Alright, here we go, what do we got?
[18:57.310 --> 18:59.590]  How do I want to do this?
[19:01.690 --> 19:04.470]  I bet I can tempt fate.
[19:07.270 --> 19:07.990]  Tempt it.
[19:08.350 --> 19:10.430]  I did. I don't know if it works.
[19:16.670 --> 19:18.550]  I'm so bad at that!
[19:19.350 --> 19:19.630]  Stop!
[19:24.760 --> 19:27.080]  No way! Half my tower!
[19:29.440 --> 19:31.800]  Wow, that was awful.
[19:34.480 --> 19:36.200]  So fucking stupid.
[19:37.280 --> 19:37.840]  Goddamn.
[19:38.260 --> 19:39.520]  I don't think I can play this.
[19:39.680 --> 19:42.680]  I mean, I gotta take big risks here, I'm done.
[19:43.460 --> 19:44.360]  Oh, bollocks.
[19:44.380 --> 19:46.020]  Boys, not good.
[19:46.120 --> 19:47.300]  That's not gonna knock me off.
[19:47.860 --> 19:49.080]  Piece of fuck, whatever.
[19:51.760 --> 19:52.480]  Last place.
[19:52.560 --> 19:53.540]  Oh my god, dude.
[19:53.860 --> 19:54.380]  That's it.
[19:54.920 --> 19:55.140]  Ah, fuck.
[19:55.720 --> 19:56.400]  Done for there.
[19:56.560 --> 19:57.300]  This is bad.
[19:57.820 --> 19:59.160]  Guys, this is not good for me.
[19:59.160 --> 19:59.980]  No, that's not gonna work.
[20:00.100 --> 20:01.280]  You said it better than Andrew.
[20:02.600 --> 20:03.460]  Oh, yeah you did.
[20:04.760 --> 20:05.120]  Disaster.
[20:09.340 --> 20:10.040]  That's a mistake.
[20:10.160 --> 20:10.660]  Oh, it works!
[20:11.100 --> 20:11.940]  I'm gonna be so mad.
[20:12.300 --> 20:13.380]  I don't think I won this one.
[20:13.580 --> 20:15.100]  I think Nick might have this one.
[20:15.900 --> 20:16.580]  One, two, three.
[20:16.580 --> 20:20.900]  Just the way he's laying them here, where he's got just under the wire on a couple of those.
[20:22.200 --> 20:24.260]  This might be the end of him.
[20:26.800 --> 20:27.600]  No way!
[20:27.640 --> 20:29.180]  What is a nudging mechanic?
[20:29.660 --> 20:30.980]  And why has nobody mentioned it to me?
[20:31.720 --> 20:32.920]  I don't know, I don't use it.
[20:33.820 --> 20:34.840]  Oh, the bumpers.
[20:36.140 --> 20:41.340]  The bumper lets you push your piece a little bit harder in one direction or the other, I think.
[20:41.840 --> 20:42.480]  Last second.
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.140]  Way to go, Nick.
[20:44.320 --> 20:44.640]  Thank you!
[20:44.680 --> 20:45.120]  That was a good one.
[20:45.680 --> 20:46.900]  That was quite the gamble.
[20:46.900 --> 20:48.400]  You're gonna be just a couple away.
[20:48.540 --> 20:49.880]  You're one more first place away, dude.
[20:50.740 --> 20:51.840]  I can't let Eric win.
[20:52.200 --> 20:52.740]  That's the goal.
[20:53.540 --> 20:54.740]  As long as Eric wins, I'm happy.
[20:55.860 --> 21:00.360]  Geoff, if you want to test it, as this piece falls, just hit the bumpers and see how it moves.
[21:00.500 --> 21:02.220]  I think it's for realigning stuff.
[21:02.720 --> 21:03.300]  Oh, I see.
[21:03.800 --> 21:06.720]  It's a mechanic that I don't touch.
[21:07.420 --> 21:07.940]  Oh, I use it.
[21:07.940 --> 21:08.400]  I don't know.
[21:10.040 --> 21:11.160]  You say you do use it, Nick?
[21:11.260 --> 21:12.000]  Oh, yeah, I love it.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.300]  Fucking anus.
[21:13.700 --> 21:18.720]  Just, oh my god, do I... I shouldn't be allowed to play after that.
[21:18.820 --> 21:19.920]  I fucked that so hard.
[21:20.180 --> 21:20.300]  Ow!
[21:20.760 --> 21:22.720]  I saw... fuck me.
[21:23.280 --> 21:25.740]  Oh, just... get out of the gate.
[21:26.240 --> 21:27.460]  Just... dog shit.
[21:29.640 --> 21:30.520]  Oh, no.
[21:32.440 --> 21:33.200]  Oh, you fucking...
[21:33.620 --> 21:34.540]  Oh, no.
[21:35.620 --> 21:37.020]  Embarrassing from a human standpoint.
[21:37.020 --> 21:37.940]  Oh, this is so bad.
[21:39.220 --> 21:40.160]  Guys, what does this do?
[21:41.080 --> 21:42.960]  Oh, it just kept me alive for a second.
[21:46.040 --> 21:47.740]  Oh, I shouldn't... no.
[21:49.180 --> 21:51.160]  No, this is not what it...
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.720]  Oh, shit, what the fuck is this?
[21:52.760 --> 21:53.940]  What is this thing?
[21:55.800 --> 21:57.060]  That boned me real good.
[21:57.240 --> 21:58.980]  Uh-oh, that might be it for Eric.
[21:59.600 --> 22:00.320]  Oh, boys.
[22:00.840 --> 22:01.240]  Hold together.
[22:02.120 --> 22:02.480]  Dang.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.440]  You guys might have me beat on this one.
[22:04.520 --> 22:05.080]  This is not good.
[22:05.080 --> 22:05.200]  Hold the line.
[22:05.860 --> 22:06.220]  No!
[22:07.120 --> 22:08.080]  Immediately wasted it.
[22:09.440 --> 22:09.860]  Hold.
[22:10.800 --> 22:12.080]  No, no, no, not there.
[22:12.360 --> 22:13.900]  Oh, I thought I was a little further over.
[22:14.120 --> 22:14.140]  Fuck.
[22:14.640 --> 22:14.980]  No!
[22:16.860 --> 22:19.000]  Okay, so you guys, you both have one heart.
[22:19.400 --> 22:20.300]  It's neck and neck.
[22:21.060 --> 22:21.860]  Nick is panicking.
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.860]  Nick is falling apart.
[22:24.740 --> 22:26.320]  Oh, but Andrew died first.
[22:29.800 --> 22:31.160]  At least Nick won.
[22:31.760 --> 22:32.980]  Fuck, Eric. Eric's not winning this round.
[22:32.980 --> 22:34.540]  He died at the same time.
[22:34.680 --> 22:35.920]  Ooga, ooga, ooga chugga.
[22:35.920 --> 22:38.040]  Nick wins this one.
[22:38.300 --> 22:38.660]  Wow.
[22:39.340 --> 22:39.980]  Oh, man.
[22:40.160 --> 22:40.440]  Good job, Nick.
[22:40.640 --> 22:41.580]  Way to go, Nick.
[22:42.180 --> 22:43.560]  Hey, hey, way to throw it, Andrew.
[22:43.720 --> 22:43.900]  Wink.
[22:45.200 --> 22:45.560]  Yeah.
[22:46.320 --> 22:46.680]  Yeah.
[22:47.160 --> 22:50.080]  Yeah, you can tell by the way he's saying that that he really...
[22:50.960 --> 22:51.020]  Yeah.
[22:51.020 --> 22:51.740]  Oh, shit.
[22:53.540 --> 22:55.000]  Yeah, this is a tough game.
[22:55.280 --> 22:57.400]  The audience feels terrible for me for being so bad at this.
[22:57.480 --> 23:00.020]  This is a tough game to pick up on the fly when everybody else knows how to play.
[23:00.320 --> 23:00.920]  It's tough.
[23:01.020 --> 23:01.400]  It's definitely tough.
[23:01.400 --> 23:02.580]  It's definitely hard to play catch up.
[23:02.700 --> 23:02.880]  Yeah.
[23:03.400 --> 23:04.100]  You're doing great.
[23:04.100 --> 23:05.120]  Yeah, you're doing fantastic.
[23:05.180 --> 23:05.780]  I mean, you picked it up a lot faster than Gavin.
[23:06.060 --> 23:06.960]  Yeah, well...
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.180]  Who learned at the same pace we did, but if you watch the video, it doesn't seem like he did.
[23:11.500 --> 23:11.640]  Yeah.
[23:12.780 --> 23:13.920]  He's still trying to pick it up.
[23:15.320 --> 23:16.400]  That's definitely true.
[23:25.090 --> 23:26.210]  Oh, no, I didn't mean to do that.
[23:26.350 --> 23:26.530]  Shit.
[23:27.990 --> 23:28.530]  Oh, well.
[23:30.770 --> 23:32.490]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good.
[23:33.790 --> 23:34.690]  Is that a good idea?
[23:34.930 --> 23:36.350]  Do I want to do that?
[23:36.530 --> 23:38.570]  I don't think so.
[23:39.150 --> 23:41.210]  Huh, I don't love my placements here.
[23:41.310 --> 23:42.050]  No, this is bad.
[23:42.250 --> 23:43.110]  I don't love what we got going on.
[23:43.170 --> 23:44.590]  Whatever I just did, I...
[23:44.590 --> 23:46.290]  I'm not a big fan of what we got.
[23:46.430 --> 23:48.150]  This square's going to be the last, and that's going to...
[23:48.150 --> 23:49.590]  I just got to take my...
[23:49.590 --> 23:49.950]  Lumps.
[23:50.170 --> 23:51.130]  I just got to take my lumps here.
[23:51.290 --> 23:51.590]  All right.
[23:51.830 --> 23:52.010]  Take your lumps.
[23:52.030 --> 23:53.090]  I mean, I just did not...
[23:53.090 --> 23:53.970]  I did not build well.
[23:54.150 --> 23:55.290]  I did not build well.
[23:55.330 --> 23:56.590]  Well, that nudge didn't nudge.
[23:57.050 --> 23:57.670]  Yeah, you gotta...
[23:58.370 --> 23:58.670]  Damn.
[23:59.070 --> 23:59.650]  Andrew, how you feeling?
[24:00.370 --> 24:00.970]  I feel good.
[24:01.010 --> 24:01.610]  I'm locked in.
[24:01.950 --> 24:02.250]  Okay.
[24:02.270 --> 24:02.990]  I'm going to win this one.
[24:03.910 --> 24:05.490]  A little early on that nudge.
[24:05.950 --> 24:07.430]  That was a little early on that nudge.
[24:07.430 --> 24:08.610]  Oh, you looking at my nudge there?
[24:08.810 --> 24:08.910]  Yeah.
[24:09.110 --> 24:09.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:09.670 --> 24:09.810]  A little early.
[24:10.070 --> 24:10.170]  Okay.
[24:10.210 --> 24:12.950]  I saw it come in, and I went, oh, holy shit.
[24:13.110 --> 24:14.070]  Nick, you fucking genius.
[24:14.610 --> 24:14.930]  Nick!
[24:15.490 --> 24:16.350]  Nick, you fool.
[24:19.210 --> 24:20.650]  I didn't need to nudge it.
[24:20.690 --> 24:21.390]  I don't know why I nudged it.
[24:21.390 --> 24:22.270]  No, no, you didn't.
[24:22.670 --> 24:24.230]  You absolutely didn't need to nudge it.
[24:24.610 --> 24:26.450]  Andrew's playing a dangerous game.
[24:27.450 --> 24:28.170]  There you go, Andrew.
[24:28.230 --> 24:28.670]  You got it.
[24:29.970 --> 24:29.990]  Oh.
[24:30.170 --> 24:31.570]  Oh, Andrew, this is perfect.
[24:32.230 --> 24:33.770]  Yeah, you might have it here, bud.
[24:34.130 --> 24:35.570]  No, that's going to...
[24:35.570 --> 24:36.690]  Oh, you should have...
[24:36.690 --> 24:37.270]  I'm winning, though.
[24:37.630 --> 24:38.510]  I got this one.
[24:38.590 --> 24:39.130]  He's got this one.
[24:39.130 --> 24:39.490]  You got it.
[24:39.590 --> 24:40.350]  I'm winning one of these.
[24:40.490 --> 24:42.530]  I think you won it.
[24:42.930 --> 24:43.470]  You did.
[24:44.150 --> 24:44.670]  Yeah, we did.
[24:45.810 --> 24:46.590]  Oh, I'm on the board.
[24:46.890 --> 24:48.170]  Hey, you know, first time for everything.
[24:48.550 --> 24:48.650]  Here we go.
[24:48.650 --> 24:49.070]  Here we go.
[24:50.130 --> 24:50.810]  I'm so...
[24:50.810 --> 24:51.870]  Geoff with the third place.
[24:51.990 --> 24:52.470]  Way to go, Geoff.
[24:52.990 --> 24:53.710]  Start now.
[24:57.010 --> 24:57.670]  Here we go.
[24:58.090 --> 24:58.450]  Survival.
[24:58.690 --> 24:59.050]  Survival.
[25:00.110 --> 25:00.670]  Build quick.
[25:01.090 --> 25:01.670]  Build efficiently.
[25:02.330 --> 25:02.610]  Mm-hmm.
[25:03.370 --> 25:04.230]  Build quick and efficiently.
[25:04.450 --> 25:04.630]  Lock it in.
[25:04.850 --> 25:05.510]  All right.
[25:05.510 --> 25:07.410]  How do I want to do this?
[25:07.610 --> 25:08.130]  Oh, cool.
[25:08.230 --> 25:09.190]  Already fucked myself.
[25:09.390 --> 25:09.670]  That's fine.
[25:09.770 --> 25:10.130]  Oh, nice.
[25:10.290 --> 25:11.030]  Oh, you sure did.
[25:11.110 --> 25:11.870]  Wow, that's...
[25:11.870 --> 25:11.910]  Yeah.
[25:12.090 --> 25:14.030]  Yeah, I don't know how that happened, but boy, it did.
[25:14.210 --> 25:15.250]  Boy, it did it do.
[25:15.910 --> 25:17.210]  Yeah, it did.
[25:17.250 --> 25:18.130]  We don't make that anymore.
[25:19.290 --> 25:20.270]  That's why I said did.
[25:25.290 --> 25:25.690]  Whoops.
[25:27.170 --> 25:28.170]  Guess who sucks?
[25:28.370 --> 25:29.390]  His name is Geoff.
[25:29.750 --> 25:32.030]  Oh, I almost fucking got that back.
[25:32.110 --> 25:34.430]  Oh, that went worse than I thought it could go.
[25:34.430 --> 25:35.930]  God damn it.
[25:36.230 --> 25:37.970]  It's the fucking sucky Geoff show.
[25:40.610 --> 25:41.590]  Guys, what does this one do?
[25:42.390 --> 25:44.190]  Oh, you're such a prick.
[25:44.570 --> 25:44.910]  You...
[25:46.790 --> 25:47.510]  You have...
[25:48.250 --> 25:48.970]  fucked me real good.
[25:48.970 --> 25:49.510]  I don't know what.
[25:49.530 --> 25:50.610]  I just gave myself a heart.
[25:51.790 --> 25:52.870]  I don't know what that does.
[25:53.290 --> 25:54.290]  Oh, I can't even move it?
[25:54.290 --> 25:55.190]  It gave you a heart, Geoff.
[25:55.330 --> 25:55.370]  Oh, no.
[25:56.350 --> 25:56.450]  Uh-oh.
[25:56.450 --> 25:56.970]  You have a life back.
[25:56.970 --> 25:57.450]  Uh-oh.
[25:57.750 --> 25:58.710]  I'm a real boy.
[25:59.630 --> 26:00.690]  Well, Eric's out.
[26:01.910 --> 26:02.270]  Damn.
[26:03.230 --> 26:04.410]  I was the first one out, guys.
[26:04.410 --> 26:05.230]  Oh, shit.
[26:05.430 --> 26:06.650]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[26:06.890 --> 26:08.890]  I did a bad...
[26:09.350 --> 26:10.830]  You can see where it's going.
[26:10.950 --> 26:11.590]  There's a big...
[26:11.590 --> 26:12.590]  There's like a big line.
[26:12.810 --> 26:13.170]  I know, I know.
[26:13.290 --> 26:17.810]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[26:19.010 --> 26:19.390]  Yay.
[26:19.890 --> 26:20.030]  Nick won.
[26:20.350 --> 26:21.970]  I don't know that Nick was trying, but Nick won.
[26:22.430 --> 26:23.290]  I didn't do anything.
[26:24.090 --> 26:25.110]  You were just holding...
[26:25.110 --> 26:26.010]  You're just hanging tough, dude.
[26:26.130 --> 26:28.130]  That giant L made me so cautious.
[26:30.290 --> 26:30.930]  Look at that.
[26:30.970 --> 26:32.090]  Me and Geoff pulling up the rear.
[26:32.210 --> 26:32.950]  Geoff, we're in last.
[26:32.950 --> 26:33.950]  Yeah, we are.
[26:35.550 --> 26:35.690]  Usually.
[26:35.790 --> 26:36.390]  Geoff's building, though.
[26:36.530 --> 26:37.590]  One medal at a time.
[26:37.710 --> 26:38.430]  He's going to get there.
[26:38.550 --> 26:38.870]  That's right.
[26:39.870 --> 26:41.430]  I like that it showed us the end.
[26:42.290 --> 26:43.430]  Yeah, that's where you can go.
[26:43.470 --> 26:45.050]  Like we don't know where we're going.
[26:45.090 --> 26:46.750]  Somebody just told me I need to pop the heart.
[26:46.870 --> 26:48.250]  I don't even know what the fuck that means.
[26:48.730 --> 26:54.170]  When you have the heart, you hit it when it's in the air and you get a life back.
[26:54.390 --> 26:55.150]  How do I hit it?
[26:55.610 --> 26:57.050]  You run into it with a piece.
[26:58.150 --> 27:00.070]  As it's coming down.
[27:01.570 --> 27:02.450]  Mm hmm.
[27:02.450 --> 27:02.990]  I see.
[27:03.110 --> 27:04.350]  I would have explained that to you.
[27:04.510 --> 27:07.230]  I felt honestly that it was self-explanatory, so I apologize.
[27:08.070 --> 27:08.670]  Yeah, no worries.
[27:08.750 --> 27:10.130]  You just can't make those kinds of assumptions.
[27:10.850 --> 27:11.930]  You know what?
[27:12.350 --> 27:14.090]  And hey, I'm learning that.
[27:14.310 --> 27:14.930]  I'm learning that.
[27:17.790 --> 27:18.670]  Oh, that's...
[27:19.670 --> 27:20.770]  That's for you.
[27:23.010 --> 27:23.290]  Fuck you.
[27:23.510 --> 27:24.230]  I deserve this.
[27:24.530 --> 27:25.050]  What ice?
[27:25.670 --> 27:26.390]  There we go.
[27:26.590 --> 27:28.730]  I don't know what this tree shit is.
[27:29.170 --> 27:29.830]  It's just water.
[27:30.450 --> 27:32.110]  No, it's just in the...
[27:32.110 --> 27:33.470]  Well, it's just...
[27:33.470 --> 27:34.110]  Oh, what's...
[27:34.110 --> 27:35.250]  I'm not crazy about the ice.
[27:35.850 --> 27:37.030]  Yeah, I don't love the ice.
[27:37.350 --> 27:38.650]  I'm not crazy about that either.
[27:39.930 --> 27:40.370]  Yes.
[27:42.210 --> 27:43.850]  I'm not crazy about the ice.
[27:46.530 --> 27:48.810]  No, no, you piece of shit.
[27:48.890 --> 27:49.730]  You stay together.
[27:50.650 --> 27:51.830]  You stay together.
[27:52.810 --> 27:53.370]  That's gonna fall.
[27:54.750 --> 27:55.830]  This is how Nick talks to his dog.
[27:56.130 --> 27:56.770]  Yeah, hey dog.
[27:57.410 --> 27:58.730]  You piece of shit.
[27:58.730 --> 27:59.350]  Yeah.
[27:59.770 --> 28:00.470]  How's that?
[28:00.710 --> 28:01.290]  Is that good?
[28:01.870 --> 28:02.830]  You're just...
[28:02.830 --> 28:03.410]  You're the worst.
[28:05.710 --> 28:06.830]  No, my piece!
[28:07.610 --> 28:08.770]  No, my other piece!
[28:09.010 --> 28:10.070]  Oh, it's an anchor.
[28:10.750 --> 28:11.570]  Oh, stay.
[28:12.850 --> 28:13.270]  No!
[28:13.650 --> 28:14.070]  Stay there.
[28:14.110 --> 28:14.970]  That might have helped me.
[28:15.590 --> 28:15.890]  No!
[28:17.110 --> 28:18.070]  Hold the line.
[28:18.430 --> 28:18.470]  No!
[28:18.810 --> 28:19.250]  No!
[28:19.890 --> 28:20.370]  No!
[28:21.730 --> 28:23.190]  That would have been cool if it had, though.
[28:23.550 --> 28:24.190]  How you doing, Nick?
[28:27.150 --> 28:28.410]  Is that right?
[28:30.390 --> 28:36.010]  Do you guys ever think about how cool it would be if I did well at stuff?
[28:36.350 --> 28:36.490]  No!
[28:37.390 --> 28:37.850]  Sorry, Geoff.
[28:38.030 --> 28:38.710]  Boy, I do.
[28:38.730 --> 28:40.610]  I didn't answer your question that way, but...
[28:40.610 --> 28:41.450]  I really do.
[28:43.070 --> 28:43.870]  I'm falling apart.
[28:43.950 --> 28:44.250]  It's over.
[28:48.150 --> 28:50.390]  I should have focused on attacking instead of helping myself.
[28:50.870 --> 28:51.930]  I should have gone to college.
[28:52.270 --> 28:52.490]  Yeah.
[28:53.030 --> 28:53.630]  I knew it.
[28:53.810 --> 28:54.450]  I should have gone back.
[28:54.610 --> 28:55.530]  I have a degree.
[28:55.530 --> 28:56.290]  Oh, no.
[28:56.350 --> 28:57.550]  I have a degree.
[28:59.350 --> 29:00.270]  What's this?
[29:00.650 --> 29:01.290]  No!
[29:01.530 --> 29:02.130]  A balloon!
[29:02.210 --> 29:03.030]  My whole tower!
[29:04.790 --> 29:06.810]  I was at the top!
[29:07.530 --> 29:07.770]  No!
[29:09.350 --> 29:09.990]  Andrew!
[29:10.650 --> 29:10.970]  No!
[29:11.710 --> 29:11.930]  No!
[29:12.810 --> 29:13.450]  No!
[29:13.970 --> 29:16.410]  Geoff is the one that's hanging on right now.
[29:16.550 --> 29:17.090]  Really?
[29:18.310 --> 29:18.810]  Hold!
[29:19.530 --> 29:20.050]  Tower!
[29:20.610 --> 29:20.630]  Hold!
[29:21.230 --> 29:21.530]  No!
[29:22.370 --> 29:23.110]  No, not the balloon!
[29:23.850 --> 29:24.250]  No!
[29:25.630 --> 29:26.330]  Oh, my God.
[29:26.370 --> 29:27.590]  My tower's splitting in half.
[29:27.710 --> 29:27.790]  No!
[29:27.890 --> 29:28.550]  It's all gone!
[29:28.610 --> 29:29.450]  It's all gone!
[29:30.430 --> 29:31.910]  Oh, stop giving...
[29:31.910 --> 29:32.390]  What are you doing?
[29:32.490 --> 29:33.230]  What the...
[29:33.770 --> 29:34.190]  No!
[29:34.490 --> 29:34.830]  No!
[29:35.530 --> 29:35.950]  No!
[29:36.810 --> 29:37.230]  No!
[29:37.570 --> 29:37.830]  No!
[29:38.250 --> 29:38.650]  No!
[29:40.010 --> 29:40.850]  I won!
[29:41.090 --> 29:41.210]  I won!
[29:42.570 --> 29:44.270]  Geoff might win this thing.
[29:44.350 --> 29:45.130]  I have to restart.
[29:45.490 --> 29:45.510]  I have to restart.
[29:45.510 --> 29:46.590]  Geoff might have it!
[29:46.710 --> 29:47.110]  Yeah!
[29:50.610 --> 29:54.070]  And then, Geoff, you just put that on the top of your tower and that's your house, baby.
[29:56.910 --> 29:57.310]  Wow!
[29:59.050 --> 29:59.650]  That was crazy.
[29:59.830 --> 30:00.230]  Gavin, who?
[30:01.870 --> 30:03.570]  I got third for that?
[30:03.770 --> 30:04.170]  Wow.
[30:04.490 --> 30:06.330]  Yeah, I'm a little disappointed in myself.
[30:07.110 --> 30:07.930]  The ice really bothered me.
[30:07.930 --> 30:08.230]  Fuck yeah, dude.
[30:08.230 --> 30:08.730]  That was fun.
[30:10.510 --> 30:11.450]  Geoff's on board now.
[30:11.470 --> 30:11.710]  Yeah.
[30:11.850 --> 30:12.690]  I like this game now.
[30:12.750 --> 30:13.710]  He likes it when he wins.
[30:18.520 --> 30:20.100]  I don't remember which one this is.
[30:21.860 --> 30:22.380]  Uh...
[30:25.360 --> 30:26.400]  I'm already...
[30:26.400 --> 30:28.260]  Listen to us lock in, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:29.180 --> 30:29.660]  Yeah, right?
[30:31.060 --> 30:32.400]  A little pretext of conversation.
[30:32.600 --> 30:32.880]  Let's go.
[30:36.880 --> 30:38.520]  I think I use that thing.
[30:40.140 --> 30:42.500]  I think this is...
[30:42.500 --> 30:45.260]  This is how I do this.
[30:45.320 --> 30:46.940]  This is how Geoff does this.
[30:53.480 --> 30:53.920]  Oh.
[30:54.140 --> 30:55.400]  Is that what I want to do?
[30:56.500 --> 30:57.380]  I don't like this.
[30:57.580 --> 30:58.540]  Oh, is this gonna...
[30:58.540 --> 30:59.260]  That's gonna fall.
[30:59.460 --> 31:00.080]  No, it'll work.
[31:00.620 --> 31:01.800]  I can't believe it worked.
[31:04.260 --> 31:04.860]  Ah, shit.
[31:07.540 --> 31:09.220]  Oh, Nick, you fool.
[31:11.640 --> 31:12.620]  Ah, shit.
[31:12.980 --> 31:13.440]  Oh, it worked.
[31:13.520 --> 31:14.900]  I cannot believe it worked.
[31:15.180 --> 31:16.040]  Don't love...
[31:16.040 --> 31:17.080]  I don't love that.
[31:17.280 --> 31:19.840]  I do think that everyone kind of figured out how this works now.
[31:19.840 --> 31:22.640]  Also, I can't skate by on freekicks.
[31:23.340 --> 31:25.840]  I think that Andrew finally figured out this mode.
[31:26.880 --> 31:27.520]  Hold.
[31:28.820 --> 31:30.000]  This is a gamble.
[31:30.340 --> 31:30.840]  Hold.
[31:31.820 --> 31:32.140]  And...
[31:32.460 --> 31:33.960]  Oh, wow, Andrew.
[31:35.440 --> 31:35.780]  Oh!
[31:38.240 --> 31:38.880]  Do it.
[31:39.340 --> 31:41.580]  Dude, that's like next level.
[31:41.720 --> 31:42.300]  That was beautiful.
[31:42.620 --> 31:44.300]  Yeah, it's a good tower.
[31:45.600 --> 31:47.820]  Nick, that's a great one, dude.
[31:48.060 --> 31:48.500]  Thanks.
[31:48.500 --> 31:49.500]  And this...
[31:50.020 --> 31:50.660]  This is...
[31:50.660 --> 31:51.700]  You are playing with fireballs.
[31:52.920 --> 31:53.560]  You know what, Nick?
[31:53.800 --> 31:58.580]  It's a shame you can't translate this ability into something useful.
[32:00.040 --> 32:01.740]  Because this is a great skill.
[32:02.080 --> 32:02.780]  Yeah, this is...
[32:02.780 --> 32:03.800]  I'm really impressed.
[32:03.940 --> 32:04.160]  Thanks.
[32:04.420 --> 32:04.820]  You might...
[32:04.820 --> 32:05.960]  I think you got this one, dude.
[32:06.180 --> 32:08.280]  I think I do.
[32:08.380 --> 32:09.360]  I feel really confident now.
[32:09.980 --> 32:11.740]  That was madness, what I just did.
[32:12.360 --> 32:12.540]  Yeah!
[32:12.580 --> 32:13.720]  Wow, that was a good one.
[32:14.700 --> 32:15.760]  Way to go, dude.
[32:17.880 --> 32:20.700]  Oh, I went non-verbal there.
[32:23.360 --> 32:24.680]  Nick only gets first.
[32:24.840 --> 32:25.980]  If he's meddling, he's getting first.
[32:26.040 --> 32:27.040]  Yeah, I think that's the way it goes.
[32:28.580 --> 32:29.600]  He's a real...
[32:29.600 --> 32:31.660]  Nick lives a min-max lifestyle.
[32:32.000 --> 32:32.500]  Yeah, absolutely.
[32:35.280 --> 32:37.940]  It's what Gus always wanted, but Nick is doing it.
[32:37.960 --> 32:38.260]  No!
[32:38.480 --> 32:39.560]  But I pulled it off.
[32:39.560 --> 32:40.060]  Ah!
[32:44.720 --> 32:47.320]  I don't like what I'm doing here.
[32:51.850 --> 32:52.490]  Revival.
[32:53.350 --> 32:55.130]  I can no longer speak.
[32:58.450 --> 32:59.810]  I'm locked in.
[33:00.870 --> 33:02.930]  Welcome to today's silent stream.
[33:03.290 --> 33:05.030]  This is the way it goes, man.
[33:05.050 --> 33:06.350]  When it really starts meaning something.
[33:06.350 --> 33:06.970]  Oh my god.
[33:07.390 --> 33:08.950]  I'm choking so badly.
[33:09.530 --> 33:09.810]  Uh-oh.
[33:10.430 --> 33:11.350]  Here, choke on this.
[33:12.850 --> 33:14.770]  Oh, you locked me in, you son of a gun.
[33:14.770 --> 33:15.570]  Oh, I didn't like that.
[33:15.590 --> 33:17.130]  I don't appreciate that.
[33:17.330 --> 33:19.910]  That doesn't bother me as much.
[33:20.370 --> 33:20.770]  Interesting.
[33:21.430 --> 33:22.350]  That's not what I wanted to hear.
[33:24.370 --> 33:25.470]  What does that do?
[33:27.350 --> 33:28.710]  Ah, fuck. Anus.
[33:31.950 --> 33:32.790]  Can't see that.
[33:32.790 --> 33:34.210]  Is that a band you grew up listening to, Geoff?
[33:35.130 --> 33:35.370]  Fuck.
[33:35.590 --> 33:36.470]  Yeah, you used to roadie for them.
[33:36.870 --> 33:37.530]  Fuck anus?
[33:37.690 --> 33:37.930]  Yeah.
[33:37.930 --> 33:38.090]  Yeah.
[33:40.270 --> 33:41.830]  They had creative differences.
[33:42.350 --> 33:43.310]  Broke up in 98.
[33:43.330 --> 33:44.210]  Hey, you know, it's the way it goes.
[33:45.710 --> 33:47.270]  Yeah, such is...
[33:47.270 --> 33:47.610]  Lock in.
[33:49.190 --> 33:50.070]  You have...
[33:50.070 --> 33:51.450]  Oh, I don't like the lock in.
[33:52.230 --> 33:53.490]  ...royally fucked me, sir.
[33:54.050 --> 33:54.490]  You...
[33:54.490 --> 33:55.250]  What the? No!
[33:55.390 --> 33:55.890]  And it's locked!
[33:56.390 --> 33:57.130]  And it's locked!
[33:57.130 --> 33:57.470]  Oh god!
[33:57.990 --> 33:58.710]  Oh no.
[33:58.710 --> 33:59.930]  Yeah, the lock was really...
[34:01.350 --> 34:02.290]  ...really the problem.
[34:02.330 --> 34:03.230]  If I have to...
[34:03.230 --> 34:04.550]  Oh my god!
[34:04.930 --> 34:06.770]  What am I gonna do? Stretch this on this?
[34:07.070 --> 34:08.270]  Look out!
[34:08.750 --> 34:09.610]  That was a mistake.
[34:09.670 --> 34:10.250]  That might have...
[34:10.250 --> 34:11.830]  I killed myself. I just killed myself.
[34:12.310 --> 34:13.490]  That might have been it for...
[34:13.490 --> 34:14.550]  That was death by me.
[34:14.950 --> 34:15.330]  No, Nick.
[34:15.430 --> 34:15.770]  On me.
[34:16.650 --> 34:16.930]  Oh.
[34:17.850 --> 34:18.390]  That was...
[34:18.390 --> 34:18.590]  No!
[34:18.590 --> 34:19.950]  That was an Andrew on Andrew crime.
[34:20.350 --> 34:20.750]  No!
[34:23.030 --> 34:24.290]  Uh-oh, I'm done.
[34:26.650 --> 34:28.850]  I really needed at least third on that one.
[34:29.230 --> 34:30.070]  Just waitin'.
[34:32.550 --> 34:33.230]  There we go.
[34:33.570 --> 34:34.510]  Is that what first place feels like?
[34:34.530 --> 34:35.130]  Feels good, guys.
[34:35.330 --> 34:35.710]  Missed it.
[34:36.270 --> 34:37.150]  Nice to be back.
[34:37.550 --> 34:38.190]  You're not winning.
[34:39.230 --> 34:39.950]  Okay, you ain't winning.
[34:40.230 --> 34:40.910]  Oh no.
[34:41.250 --> 34:41.790]  Tied for first?
[34:41.970 --> 34:42.730]  This is tight.
[34:42.870 --> 34:43.210]  This is tight.
[34:43.210 --> 34:43.950]  Three-way tied for first.
[34:43.970 --> 34:45.090]  Nobody can win on this one.
[34:45.350 --> 34:46.530]  But after that...
[34:46.530 --> 34:47.030]  Oh, this is bad.
[34:47.410 --> 34:48.410]  This is terrible.
[34:50.350 --> 34:50.630]  Fuck.
[34:51.050 --> 34:52.230]  I don't even know what to do here.
[34:52.790 --> 34:53.270]  Oh, yes I do.
[34:59.420 --> 35:00.340]  I don't like this.
[35:00.780 --> 35:01.460]  Do I... do I do it?
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.260]  Do I...
[35:03.140 --> 35:03.980]  That's gonna fall.
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.180]  Oh, I just fucked myself.
[35:05.380 --> 35:06.200]  Oh, I think I did too.
[35:06.660 --> 35:07.000]  Okay.
[35:07.700 --> 35:08.320]  God damn.
[35:08.320 --> 35:10.140]  This is not mine to win here, boys.
[35:10.720 --> 35:11.400]  Oh, I'm gonna...
[35:12.260 --> 35:12.620]  Damn it, Eric.
[35:12.780 --> 35:13.400]  You're doing the...
[35:13.400 --> 35:13.660]  Oh.
[35:14.360 --> 35:15.120]  Ah, fucking idiot.
[35:15.120 --> 35:15.560]  Oh, no!
[35:15.640 --> 35:16.480]  I thought it was shorter.
[35:16.780 --> 35:17.440]  Well, I got...
[35:17.440 --> 35:18.940]  Guys, see if you can beat three.
[35:19.260 --> 35:20.060]  No, I can't.
[35:20.100 --> 35:20.920]  There's nothing I can do.
[35:21.060 --> 35:21.480]  I'm done.
[35:21.960 --> 35:22.540]  I can't.
[35:22.540 --> 35:23.320]  Oh my god.
[35:23.700 --> 35:24.820]  I'm stuck with Eric at three.
[35:25.440 --> 35:26.440]  I did fucking two.
[35:28.020 --> 35:29.460]  Andrew, it's up to you.
[35:29.660 --> 35:29.920]  Andrew.
[35:32.120 --> 35:32.840]  Oh, no!
[35:34.420 --> 35:34.780]  No!
[35:37.100 --> 35:38.200]  Andrew, it was yours to lose.
[35:38.200 --> 35:39.740]  Did we just tie for first?
[35:41.640 --> 35:42.460]  Oh, no.
[35:42.660 --> 35:43.540]  Are we all one away?
[35:43.900 --> 35:44.220]  Andrew, it was yours to lose.
[35:44.220 --> 35:45.300]  Are we all one away?
[35:46.260 --> 35:47.820]  Oh my god.
[35:48.080 --> 35:48.880]  Oh, no.
[35:53.280 --> 35:53.880]  This is...
[35:53.880 --> 35:55.400]  Is it most medals win?
[35:55.880 --> 35:56.880]  Yeah, I believe so.
[35:57.080 --> 35:57.760]  Oh, this is hell.
[35:58.380 --> 35:59.360]  This is a race to the top.
[36:00.940 --> 36:01.640]  Here we go.
[36:04.020 --> 36:06.020]  Oh, I almost fucked this immediately.
[36:06.360 --> 36:07.160]  This is so...
[36:07.160 --> 36:08.020]  I fucked it already.
[36:08.240 --> 36:08.900]  Oh, no.
[36:09.400 --> 36:10.560]  Oh, no.
[36:12.580 --> 36:13.580]  I fucked...
[36:13.580 --> 36:14.440]  Oh, no.
[36:14.920 --> 36:15.520]  Well...
[36:15.520 --> 36:18.120]  Man, the fucking pain you can hear.
[36:19.140 --> 36:19.800]  I'm just...
[36:19.800 --> 36:20.040]  It's real.
[36:20.300 --> 36:20.860]  I'm falling apart.
[36:21.060 --> 36:22.880]  And it is definitely real.
[36:24.260 --> 36:25.080]  Oh, dick.
[36:25.300 --> 36:26.460]  Dick in ass.
[36:26.900 --> 36:27.760]  What was that?
[36:28.880 --> 36:29.600]  I'm shit.
[36:29.860 --> 36:30.120]  Fuck.
[36:30.660 --> 36:31.200]  That fell.
[36:31.280 --> 36:31.620]  That's okay.
[36:32.440 --> 36:33.960]  Just knock it all off.
[36:37.260 --> 36:39.020]  I don't even know what this fucking...
[36:39.020 --> 36:39.740]  Is it just supposed to be...
[36:39.740 --> 36:40.880]  It's just making it...
[36:40.880 --> 36:41.700]  It's just in the way.
[36:41.940 --> 36:42.920]  The shrubs are just in the way.
[36:43.180 --> 36:43.660]  Fuck y'all.
[36:44.100 --> 36:45.720]  Oh, you pieces of shit.
[36:45.760 --> 36:46.720]  Wow, this is insane.
[36:47.360 --> 36:48.180]  Gotta get rid of that.
[36:48.180 --> 36:48.820]  This went...
[36:48.820 --> 36:49.820]  This went crazy.
[36:51.180 --> 36:51.620]  Fuck.
[36:52.560 --> 36:52.920]  What?
[36:53.780 --> 36:54.640]  Stop spinning.
[36:56.200 --> 36:57.020]  Oh, shit.
[36:57.180 --> 36:57.740]  I'm just boned.
[36:57.740 --> 36:59.100]  Thanks for the ice.
[37:00.040 --> 37:02.120]  Wow, and the balloon comes back too?
[37:02.800 --> 37:03.000]  Oof.
[37:04.860 --> 37:06.480]  Back in the saddle.
[37:07.340 --> 37:08.180]  And forth.
[37:10.460 --> 37:12.720]  Back in the saddle again.
[37:15.140 --> 37:16.300]  That's not gonna work.
[37:16.860 --> 37:17.260]  Uh-oh.
[37:17.380 --> 37:17.540]  Uh-oh.
[37:17.720 --> 37:19.820]  Oh, no.
[37:21.380 --> 37:22.460]  Oh, no.
[37:23.860 --> 37:26.480]  Oh, I'm a fucking idiot.
[37:27.600 --> 37:28.300]  Stupid.
[37:28.300 --> 37:28.520]  Oh, God.
[37:28.760 --> 37:29.240]  Oh, no.
[37:30.160 --> 37:30.600]  Why?
[37:31.560 --> 37:31.900]  Oh, no.
[37:32.000 --> 37:32.180]  Wow.
[37:32.300 --> 37:32.760]  Oh, no.
[37:32.900 --> 37:35.200]  Half my tower left and right style!
[37:35.380 --> 37:36.020]  Yes, yes, yes.
[37:36.040 --> 37:36.680]  Oh, no.
[37:37.160 --> 37:38.140]  Yes, yes, yes.
[37:38.920 --> 37:39.940]  Oh, my base.
[37:40.180 --> 37:40.540]  Yes.
[37:40.660 --> 37:42.300]  Oh, boys, the base just came out.
[37:42.440 --> 37:43.540]  All your base belonged to us.
[37:44.040 --> 37:44.940]  Oh, dude.
[37:45.580 --> 37:46.900]  We got an ace of base.
[37:48.420 --> 37:49.300]  Oh, God.
[37:49.840 --> 37:51.340]  Oh, that's not gonna balance anywhere.
[37:51.480 --> 37:52.300]  That didn't balance!
[37:53.000 --> 37:53.840]  What does this do?
[37:54.640 --> 37:55.020]  That might.
[37:55.260 --> 37:55.700]  Christ.
[37:56.660 --> 37:59.720]  I'm so supremely screwed.
[38:02.700 --> 38:04.000]  My whole tower's gone.
[38:04.000 --> 38:04.520]  Oh, shit.
[38:04.600 --> 38:06.180]  My whole tower just fell.
[38:06.800 --> 38:08.020]  The whole thing.
[38:09.640 --> 38:10.780]  Oh, boys.
[38:11.020 --> 38:12.780]  I wish I could start over.
[38:12.880 --> 38:14.100]  No, that's so bad.
[38:14.200 --> 38:14.860]  It's so bad.
[38:15.360 --> 38:20.140]  Yes, I wish I could go back in time and undo a lifetime of bad decisions.
[38:20.760 --> 38:21.500]  Ice to meet you.
[38:28.570 --> 38:29.510]  No, I don't want that.
[38:30.710 --> 38:31.990]  No, it didn't lock in.
[38:32.290 --> 38:33.190]  Oh, it didn't lock in.
[38:33.470 --> 38:34.430]  Oh, boys.
[38:35.170 --> 38:35.870]  It's tight.
[38:35.990 --> 38:36.470]  It's tight.
[38:36.730 --> 38:37.930]  It's tight as can be at the top.
[38:38.250 --> 38:39.390]  Oh, there it goes.
[38:39.910 --> 38:41.170]  All the way to the bottom.
[38:41.430 --> 38:43.090]  No, there's no way for...
[38:43.090 --> 38:43.690]  Oh, Geoff.
[38:44.110 --> 38:44.450]  No, Nick.
[38:44.790 --> 38:45.270]  No, Nick.
[38:45.470 --> 38:46.050]  No, Nick.
[38:46.150 --> 38:46.770]  Oh, no!
[38:47.030 --> 38:47.470]  Stay calm.
[38:47.750 --> 38:48.690]  We can start from there.
[38:49.790 --> 38:51.290]  This is a place to begin from.
[38:51.770 --> 38:52.250]  I think...
[38:52.250 --> 38:54.030]  Andrew's trying to lock in.
[38:54.410 --> 38:54.630]  No.
[38:54.690 --> 38:55.150]  Stay calm.
[38:55.190 --> 38:56.710]  No, you've...
[38:58.210 --> 38:59.550]  Why does it have to spin?
[38:59.550 --> 39:00.130]  No!
[39:05.810 --> 39:06.770]  That's it.
[39:07.150 --> 39:08.170]  Come on, baby.
[39:08.710 --> 39:09.290]  Come on.
[39:09.510 --> 39:10.330]  Come on.
[39:10.510 --> 39:11.710]  No, no, no, no!
[39:11.910 --> 39:12.010]  Hold!
[39:12.350 --> 39:13.710]  Andrew had it.
[39:13.750 --> 39:14.030]  Hold!
[39:14.030 --> 39:15.090]  Andrew had it!
[39:15.430 --> 39:15.750]  Yes!
[39:16.130 --> 39:16.470]  Wow!
[39:16.910 --> 39:18.030]  Nick took it!
[39:18.630 --> 39:18.790]  Yes!
[39:19.530 --> 39:21.710]  What tower was taller than his?
[39:23.130 --> 39:24.970]  Not for long enough.
[39:26.750 --> 39:28.230]  Look at that.
[39:29.450 --> 39:30.410]  Congratulations, Nick.
[39:30.510 --> 39:31.050]  Thanks, man.
[39:31.110 --> 39:31.490]  Way to go, Nick.
[39:32.590 --> 39:33.750]  Way to go, Nick.
[39:34.010 --> 39:34.650]  Hey, yeah.
[39:34.750 --> 39:37.550]  I mean, count your losses however you want, Andrew.
[39:37.670 --> 39:38.170]  That's totally fine.
[39:38.170 --> 39:38.590]  I am.
[39:38.810 --> 39:39.590]  Way to go, Nick.
[39:40.190 --> 39:41.270]  Congratulations, Nick.
[39:41.690 --> 39:42.130]  Oh, my God.
[39:42.150 --> 39:44.470]  The rest of us in the mud.
[39:44.790 --> 39:46.310]  I'm actually not counting my loss.
[39:46.450 --> 39:47.010]  I'm counting yours.
[39:47.030 --> 39:47.930]  Way to go, Andrew.
[39:48.050 --> 39:49.270]  Might as well have been in last place.
[39:49.350 --> 39:49.890]  Way to go, man.
[39:50.590 --> 39:50.950]  Yes!
[39:52.790 --> 39:53.150]  My...
[39:53.150 --> 39:54.650]  Good job, Nick.
[39:54.810 --> 39:55.450]  Nick, big win.
[39:55.510 --> 39:56.430]  Way to go, dude.
[39:56.550 --> 39:57.330]  Are your losses?
[39:59.050 --> 39:59.930]  Oh, interesting.
[40:00.850 --> 40:03.090]  Starting this is really something.
[40:03.110 --> 40:05.350]  How do I want to play this game?
[40:07.050 --> 40:07.810]  Not well.
[40:09.430 --> 40:11.570]  Are you telling me that?
[40:11.830 --> 40:14.330]  Consider not well as an option.
[40:14.330 --> 40:14.810]  Oh, what happened?
[40:14.870 --> 40:15.570]  It didn't go.
[40:15.710 --> 40:16.250]  Oh, no.
[40:16.590 --> 40:17.050]  Okay.
[40:17.450 --> 40:18.790]  Oh, bad boys.
[40:20.790 --> 40:21.970]  What you gonna do?
[40:23.430 --> 40:24.170]  Nothing good.
[40:25.370 --> 40:26.550]  All right, that.
[40:26.990 --> 40:28.110]  Good anchor point.
[40:28.210 --> 40:29.610]  Sneak in, sneak in, sneak in.
[40:30.030 --> 40:30.350]  Okay.
[40:31.110 --> 40:31.990]  Oh, that good.
[40:32.930 --> 40:33.950]  How you doing over there, Geoff?
[40:34.790 --> 40:36.590]  Uh, you know, I'm doing okay.
[40:36.770 --> 40:37.130]  I'm still...
[40:37.130 --> 40:40.130]  I feel like I'm playing catch up a little bit on the game still, but I'm getting pretty...
[40:40.130 --> 40:41.470]  I'm getting pretty comfortable with it.
[40:41.470 --> 40:41.750]  You're figuring it out.
[40:41.870 --> 40:42.590]  So, I'm in...
[40:42.590 --> 40:43.370]  I'm having...
[40:43.370 --> 40:44.190]  I'm having fun times.
[40:44.730 --> 40:45.250]  That's good.
[40:45.670 --> 40:46.530]  I'm having good fun times.
[40:48.130 --> 40:48.990]  That's not gonna...
[40:48.990 --> 40:49.570]  Oh, it did.
[40:51.090 --> 40:52.590]  Every once in a while you get a nice little surprise.
[40:53.090 --> 40:53.390]  Mm-hmm.
[40:57.160 --> 40:58.120]  Every once in a while.
[40:59.160 --> 41:00.700]  What do you think the chances are this will...
[41:00.700 --> 41:01.480]  This will hold?
[41:01.580 --> 41:02.440]  Oh, I should just go in.
[41:02.540 --> 41:03.060]  Oh, I fucked up.
[41:03.080 --> 41:03.400]  You know what?
[41:03.600 --> 41:04.100]  I think I'm just...
[41:04.100 --> 41:05.080]  I think I'm just gonna take it.
[41:05.200 --> 41:06.500]  I think I'm just gonna take it and see how I did.
[41:07.460 --> 41:08.600]  I think I got fourth place.
[41:11.200 --> 41:12.740]  Oh, Nick, you got some moves here.
[41:12.860 --> 41:13.860]  I got some space.
[41:15.080 --> 41:15.640]  Not a lot.
[41:16.180 --> 41:16.720]  Let's see.
[41:16.820 --> 41:21.260]  I like the bets going on in the chat when we do this live.
[41:21.640 --> 41:21.820]  Yeah.
[41:22.060 --> 41:22.980]  Cut me...
[41:22.980 --> 41:24.020]  You gotta cut us in on the big.
[41:25.660 --> 41:26.220]  Good stuff.
[41:26.980 --> 41:28.460]  Oh, Nick, I think you might have this one maybe.
[41:28.460 --> 41:29.140]  Maybe.
[41:29.720 --> 41:30.700]  Can I do anything?
[41:30.960 --> 41:32.240]  Andrew's looking good, though.
[41:32.420 --> 41:33.500]  I don't think I can do anything else.
[41:33.580 --> 41:34.260]  That's great, Andrew.
[41:34.400 --> 41:35.240]  Andrew's looking really good here.
[41:35.760 --> 41:36.560]  I'm trying.
[41:36.880 --> 41:37.120]  Nice.
[41:37.180 --> 41:38.840]  I feel like that was a really good move there, Andrew.
[41:39.060 --> 41:40.040]  Damn, he's solid.
[41:40.120 --> 41:41.060]  This is a solid...
[41:41.060 --> 41:41.180]  Oh.
[41:47.080 --> 41:47.880]  Fuck you.
[41:48.260 --> 41:49.140]  That's incredible.
[41:52.500 --> 41:53.400]  How's that, man?
[41:53.700 --> 41:54.100]  Awesome.
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.200]  Oh, you slammed it and it almost knocked the other ones off.
[41:57.280 --> 41:57.440]  Yeah.
[41:57.900 --> 41:58.300]  Yeah.
[42:01.100 --> 42:03.700]  Andrew, you dirty son of a bitch.
[42:03.880 --> 42:05.500]  Oh my god, he can just ride this out right here.
[42:05.980 --> 42:06.900]  He can try, yeah.
[42:07.060 --> 42:07.420]  Absolutely.
[42:08.380 --> 42:09.620]  Go down delicately.
[42:10.740 --> 42:12.020]  You can fit it.
[42:12.100 --> 42:12.440]  It can fit.
[42:13.240 --> 42:13.840]  Put it over there.
[42:14.300 --> 42:15.360]  Yeah, put it on.
[42:15.540 --> 42:15.880]  Put it on.
[42:17.100 --> 42:18.320]  You got it.
[42:18.860 --> 42:19.860]  He hit the edge.
[42:20.160 --> 42:20.900]  He got it.
[42:20.980 --> 42:21.960]  Way to go, Andrew.
[42:22.520 --> 42:23.440]  That's awesome.
[42:23.660 --> 42:25.140]  I wanted it to fall, but...
[42:25.140 --> 42:25.680]  So bad.
[42:27.640 --> 42:28.480]  Way to go.
[42:28.480 --> 42:28.960]  Wow.
[42:29.060 --> 42:31.800]  Me and Andrew had the exact same move for our vines.
[42:33.660 --> 42:34.160]  Oh yeah?
[42:34.180 --> 42:35.660]  We put them in the exact same spots.
[42:35.840 --> 42:36.520]  Oh, wow.
[42:38.060 --> 42:39.200]  That might be...
[42:39.520 --> 42:41.100]  That might be the highest we've ever done.
[42:41.240 --> 42:41.500]  16.
[42:41.500 --> 42:42.140]  Oh my god.
[42:42.820 --> 42:43.820]  Might be a world record.
[42:44.080 --> 42:45.000]  That's pretty awesome.
[42:45.360 --> 42:46.040]  I think it is.
[42:46.140 --> 42:46.860]  Yeah, I think definitively.
[42:46.860 --> 42:47.420]  Way to go, dude.
[42:47.700 --> 42:48.400]  That was incredible.
[42:48.520 --> 42:48.580]  Thanks, man.
[42:48.580 --> 42:48.940]  Well done.
[42:49.680 --> 42:50.380]  Yeah, that was...
[42:50.380 --> 42:52.700]  1 in 700, I do okay.
[42:53.220 --> 42:56.180]  When we're done with this, you should probably call your family and let them know you did that.
[42:56.460 --> 42:56.960]  I will.
[42:59.040 --> 43:00.560]  Gonna write to the mayor of my town.
[43:02.120 --> 43:04.080]  We should see if we can get you back in the paper.
[43:12.170 --> 43:12.950]  Don't die.
[43:13.410 --> 43:13.970]  What are these?
[43:14.090 --> 43:14.770]  What's happening?
[43:14.910 --> 43:16.150]  Why aren't these locking in right?
[43:16.430 --> 43:16.870]  There we go.
[43:17.250 --> 43:17.830]  They don't like you.
[43:18.290 --> 43:19.250]  No, they don't.
[43:19.490 --> 43:20.090]  That's clear.
[43:20.170 --> 43:20.950]  That's evident, bud.
[43:21.610 --> 43:22.230]  I see that.
[43:24.390 --> 43:25.050]  Move this.
[43:26.250 --> 43:26.630]  Stay.
[43:26.910 --> 43:27.590]  Okay, it did.
[43:27.590 --> 43:28.370]  Phew.
[43:29.770 --> 43:33.530]  I'm less confident about this move, but...
[43:34.850 --> 43:35.450]  No!
[43:36.410 --> 43:38.470]  That is less than ideal.
[43:39.110 --> 43:39.670]  That actually...
[43:40.350 --> 43:41.670]  That actually may have been okay.
[43:41.710 --> 43:42.750]  Oh god, fast pieces!
[43:43.530 --> 43:44.150]  Nope, nope.
[43:44.170 --> 43:44.270]  Fast pieces!
[43:44.270 --> 43:44.930]  That wasn't okay.
[43:45.230 --> 43:46.330]  Fast pieces!
[43:48.170 --> 43:49.610]  They sure are fast.
[43:49.950 --> 43:50.590]  They were.
[43:51.930 --> 43:52.890]  Those are quick...
[43:52.890 --> 43:53.650]  Pie...
[43:53.650 --> 43:54.050]  Pieces.
[43:56.650 --> 43:59.010]  That somehow ended up working out for me.
[44:03.500 --> 44:03.880]  Oh god.
[44:05.160 --> 44:06.200]  I'm in panic mode.
[44:06.800 --> 44:07.160]  No!
[44:07.400 --> 44:07.660]  No!
[44:07.860 --> 44:10.320]  Oh, you have royally F'd me.
[44:11.060 --> 44:12.860]  You know what I saw at the grocery store?
[44:13.320 --> 44:13.760]  No!
[44:13.900 --> 44:15.420]  Yesterday, when I was checking out?
[44:15.600 --> 44:16.040]  What's that?
[44:16.120 --> 44:16.600]  Well, I'm done.
[44:16.860 --> 44:18.520]  A Garfield magazine.
[44:19.180 --> 44:19.600]  Really?
[44:20.120 --> 44:23.480]  Yeah, I was like, Garfield, America's favorite cat or something.
[44:23.480 --> 44:28.560]  And I was like, I thought briefly about buying it, but then I remembered magazines cost like 16 bucks, so I didn't even pick them up.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.500]  Yeah, I mean, the movie is...
[44:31.500 --> 44:32.640]  I think the movie's hot, baby.
[44:33.220 --> 44:33.480]  Yeah.
[44:34.200 --> 44:35.000]  Oh my god.
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.900]  Not from a ticket-selling standpoint.
[44:38.180 --> 44:39.040]  No, no, no, no, no.
[44:39.560 --> 44:40.320]  No, not at all.
[44:40.560 --> 44:41.200]  Pretty good.
[44:42.140 --> 44:43.020]  It's no...
[44:43.840 --> 44:46.500]  It's no Despicable Me 9 or whatever.
[44:49.950 --> 44:51.990]  I got that movie league locked up.
[44:52.250 --> 44:54.130]  What is this one we're doing? I didn't see.
[44:54.130 --> 44:55.910]  Race to the top.
[44:55.910 --> 44:55.970]  Race to the top.
[44:56.430 --> 44:56.930]  Ah, okay.
[44:58.070 --> 45:02.470]  Andrew, you really think you have the... we should do an update episode soon.
[45:03.430 --> 45:03.850]  That'd be fun.
[45:04.590 --> 45:07.130]  Doesn't... isn't it pretty clear that Gavin's got it locked up?
[45:07.270 --> 45:07.510]  Nope.
[45:07.770 --> 45:09.250]  That's not... well, here's the thing, Geoff.
[45:09.270 --> 45:09.650]  Bunch of fucking amateurs.
[45:09.650 --> 45:12.390]  That's not what Andrew just said, so I would love to...
[45:12.390 --> 45:14.970]  Ask the guy who's done this countless times.
[45:15.250 --> 45:15.550]  Uh-huh.
[45:15.950 --> 45:17.830]  Anyone's thinking that Gavin's gonna win this.
[45:18.030 --> 45:22.170]  And that's... and that's why we should do a catch-up episode soon.
[45:22.290 --> 45:22.550]  Yeah.
[45:22.550 --> 45:23.330]  What's this, dude?
[45:23.430 --> 45:25.470]  So we can go over the delusions that he's having.
[45:26.070 --> 45:26.250]  Yeah.
[45:27.210 --> 45:28.950]  Y'all don't even know what you're talking about.
[45:29.270 --> 45:30.130]  I don't think you do.
[45:31.370 --> 45:33.790]  Why wouldn't I? I've done this way more than you have.
[45:34.430 --> 45:35.170]  Oh, oh.
[45:35.290 --> 45:37.130]  What happened to my whole tower?!
[45:37.130 --> 45:37.970]  Oh, boys.
[45:39.030 --> 45:40.770]  Guys, it's not coming home.
[45:44.890 --> 45:46.250]  It is staying away.
[45:46.270 --> 45:47.250]  So rarely does.
[45:47.810 --> 45:48.990]  Yeah, it really does not.
[45:49.090 --> 45:52.270]  For as long as I've known certain people, it has not come home.
[45:52.270 --> 45:53.350]  Yeah, no.
[45:53.350 --> 45:54.270]  I mean...
[45:55.010 --> 45:55.910]  58 years of pain.
[45:59.730 --> 46:00.870]  I don't even... can you imagine?
[46:01.050 --> 46:01.890]  Why did I do that?
[46:03.010 --> 46:04.130]  Do you guys like balloons?
[46:04.430 --> 46:06.790]  You guys are a bunch of twats.
[46:06.810 --> 46:07.370]  Like dodgy.
[46:08.470 --> 46:11.270]  Wow, my whole tower.
[46:11.490 --> 46:14.710]  My whole tower just took a... well, let's just start building from here, I suppose.
[46:15.870 --> 46:16.590]  Fuck me.
[46:17.510 --> 46:18.190]  Oh, boys.
[46:18.470 --> 46:19.990]  Not good for ol' Eric.
[46:20.770 --> 46:21.290]  Oh, that's...
[46:21.290 --> 46:22.770]  Bad news, bad news.
[46:25.050 --> 46:26.310]  Dum-de-dum-de-dum.
[46:26.650 --> 46:27.290]  Oh, there goes that piece.
[46:27.450 --> 46:28.550]  Oh, there goes that piece.
[46:28.770 --> 46:29.490]  Oh, there goes that piece.
[46:29.490 --> 46:30.330]  Oh, don't fall.
[46:30.550 --> 46:30.970]  Don't fall.
[46:31.130 --> 46:31.510]  You got it.
[46:32.650 --> 46:33.690]  Just chill out.
[46:33.770 --> 46:34.170]  You're fine.
[46:34.510 --> 46:34.790]  You got it.
[46:35.310 --> 46:35.890]  Fucking idiot!
[46:37.790 --> 46:38.570]  You got it.
[46:38.630 --> 46:39.030]  You're okay.
[46:39.410 --> 46:40.990]  I hate myself.
[46:45.490 --> 46:46.590]  Can't stand me.
[46:46.690 --> 46:48.230]  No, don't do it.
[46:49.670 --> 46:50.070]  No.
[46:51.550 --> 46:52.550]  No, I'm not doing that.
[46:53.230 --> 46:54.310]  You guys like balloons?
[47:03.090 --> 47:03.450]  Nope.
[47:04.290 --> 47:05.870]  Oh, boys, we're about to see...
[47:05.870 --> 47:06.470]  Stop rocking.
[47:06.490 --> 47:08.510]  We're about to see top to bottom rebuild.
[47:09.970 --> 47:12.110]  That's right, I'm the New York Giants, baby.
[47:12.250 --> 47:13.630]  I'm on a constant rebuild.
[47:13.750 --> 47:14.630]  I'm the Jets.
[47:14.710 --> 47:16.430]  I haven't made the playoffs since 2010.
[47:17.310 --> 47:17.770]  Let's do...
[47:17.770 --> 47:18.470]  I don't need to say...
[47:18.470 --> 47:19.290]  Clark Sanchez!
[47:22.550 --> 47:23.530]  I think I just won.
[47:24.230 --> 47:24.710]  Nice.
[47:24.750 --> 47:25.790]  Nice job, Geoff!
[47:27.090 --> 47:27.830]  Way to go, dude.
[47:29.810 --> 47:30.910]  Put my house down.
[47:31.550 --> 47:35.250]  I'm getting so many TikToks that are just clips from Hard Knocks.
[47:35.510 --> 47:36.750]  And it's just...
[47:36.750 --> 47:39.610]  Here's them not signing Saquon Barkley.
[47:39.850 --> 47:40.510]  And it's awesome.
[47:40.850 --> 47:41.450]  It's really great.
[47:41.930 --> 47:42.650]  It's really, really great.
[47:42.670 --> 47:44.050]  It's just the owner being like,
[47:44.090 --> 47:47.390]  I'm gonna have a real struggle if he goes to the Eagles.
[47:47.670 --> 47:48.590]  And then it happened.
[47:48.970 --> 47:49.590]  And then it happened.
[47:49.590 --> 47:52.750]  Thank you Peebus Jeebus for 20 gifted subs.
[47:52.850 --> 47:53.650]  Oh my God!
[47:53.650 --> 47:53.830]  Wow!
[47:53.870 --> 47:54.930]  Oh my God!
[47:55.290 --> 47:56.030]  Appreciate you.
[47:56.150 --> 47:56.450]  Thank you.
[47:56.470 --> 47:58.870]  Can I ask you guys a really dumb question?
[47:59.170 --> 47:59.510]  Yeah, sure.
[47:59.510 --> 48:00.630]  What does that mean, exactly?
[48:01.250 --> 48:03.370]  Like, what does a subscription grant somebody?
[48:03.610 --> 48:04.550]  Is it...
[48:04.550 --> 48:05.030]  Emotes.
[48:05.830 --> 48:07.990]  Yeah, it's ad-free and it's emotes.
[48:08.510 --> 48:09.290]  Oh, wow.
[48:09.410 --> 48:10.530]  That's a really lovely thing to do.
[48:10.950 --> 48:11.910]  It is fantastic.
[48:12.450 --> 48:13.650]  So, thank you Peebus Jeebus.
[48:13.910 --> 48:16.530]  He just said 20 random people can have this.
[48:17.190 --> 48:17.390]  Aww.
[48:17.390 --> 48:18.250]  What a sweetheart.
[48:19.250 --> 48:20.290]  Thank you, Peebus.
[48:20.450 --> 48:21.590]  Oh, I suck.
[48:22.110 --> 48:22.490]  Yeah.
[48:24.410 --> 48:26.090]  This is not my game type, this one.
[48:27.150 --> 48:27.910]  You know...
[48:27.910 --> 48:28.270]  I like the stacker.
[48:28.350 --> 48:28.810]  I don't like that.
[48:28.810 --> 48:30.130]  You know, I get it. I understand.
[48:30.510 --> 48:32.290]  I don't agree, but I get it.
[48:32.870 --> 48:34.210]  You think it is my game type?
[48:34.570 --> 48:34.870]  Yeah.
[48:36.270 --> 48:39.250]  I think you just gotta think ahead, you know what I mean?
[48:40.930 --> 48:41.310]  No.
[48:41.450 --> 48:41.750]  There we go.
[48:42.390 --> 48:43.150]  Well, that was it.
[48:43.730 --> 48:43.930]  Yep.
[48:44.650 --> 48:45.210]  Me and you, bud.
[48:45.210 --> 48:46.330]  See, Nick?
[48:46.530 --> 48:51.350]  Nick is thinking in a way where he's trying to, like, left and right, load out the middle, see what he can do.
[48:51.470 --> 48:56.390]  Andrew has decided that left and right is his... that's gonna be his go-to.
[48:56.550 --> 48:57.910]  Well, that actually works.
[48:57.970 --> 48:58.230]  No!
[48:58.270 --> 48:59.630]  And, uh, saw that coming.
[49:01.130 --> 49:02.010]  Is this short?
[49:02.170 --> 49:02.590]  Damn.
[49:02.930 --> 49:04.490]  Well, I fucked myself.
[49:04.950 --> 49:05.590]  Daddy wins.
[49:08.070 --> 49:08.510]  Papa?
[49:11.350 --> 49:11.790]  Papa?
[49:12.270 --> 49:13.290]  Did you fuck yourself?
[49:15.650 --> 49:16.770]  Behind the shed, Papa.
[49:17.170 --> 49:17.710]  Oh, boy.
[49:17.910 --> 49:19.010]  Tied with Nick.
[49:19.390 --> 49:20.050]  Look at that.
[49:20.550 --> 49:21.490]  Andrew's in the lead.
[49:22.090 --> 49:22.910]  He is.
[49:24.490 --> 49:25.750]  Oh, no.
[49:26.830 --> 49:27.710]  Oh, no.
[49:29.110 --> 49:30.030]  Survive, Geoff.
[49:30.310 --> 49:31.330]  Beat me if you can.
[49:31.550 --> 49:32.690]  Survive if I let you.
[49:33.450 --> 49:34.290]  Oh, I don't...
[49:34.290 --> 49:35.210]  Oh, that actually worked.
[49:37.410 --> 49:38.390]  If I let you?
[49:38.810 --> 49:39.130]  Ow.
[49:40.470 --> 49:41.310]  I don't like that.
[49:41.310 --> 49:43.430]  I would be, like, using, like, balloons and stuff, you know?
[49:43.970 --> 49:44.850]  I don't like that.
[49:44.850 --> 49:45.650]  Like, that's how...
[49:45.650 --> 49:48.270]  That's, like, how I would not let you.
[49:49.750 --> 49:50.230]  Yeah.
[49:50.590 --> 49:52.070]  What do you think the chances are I can...
[49:52.070 --> 49:53.010]  Yeah, you suck.
[49:54.510 --> 49:55.730]  Sounded like they weren't good.
[49:56.510 --> 49:56.710]  Yeah.
[49:57.270 --> 49:58.570]  Oh, so bad chances, then, huh?
[50:01.030 --> 50:01.710]  That's okay.
[50:02.290 --> 50:03.590]  It all worked out.
[50:04.150 --> 50:04.670]  Oh, good.
[50:04.830 --> 50:05.750]  That's a miss for you.
[50:10.040 --> 50:11.860]  Oh, I wasted my lock.
[50:12.240 --> 50:12.660]  Damn.
[50:13.160 --> 50:14.060]  Somebody else locked.
[50:17.340 --> 50:19.240]  What is happening?
[50:20.760 --> 50:23.920]  Gotta hope there's some big pieces out there.
[50:24.020 --> 50:25.120]  Holy shit.
[50:26.160 --> 50:26.920]  I might...
[50:26.920 --> 50:27.420]  I might...
[50:27.420 --> 50:28.900]  I might be boned.
[50:29.780 --> 50:30.340]  But...
[50:30.340 --> 50:30.900]  Oh, can I?
[50:34.620 --> 50:35.180]  No!
[50:36.240 --> 50:37.300]  What a load of...
[50:37.620 --> 50:38.160]  Eh, whatever.
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.040]  He's so over it so fast.
[50:43.460 --> 50:44.000]  What a load...
[50:44.000 --> 50:44.580]  I don't care.
[50:44.860 --> 50:46.400]  Yeah, I don't give a fuck about this.
[50:47.600 --> 50:47.960]  Stupid.
[50:48.260 --> 50:49.240]  Why do you...
[50:49.240 --> 50:52.320]  Why do you insist on doing it at the same time I do, Eric?
[50:52.460 --> 50:53.120]  I thought it would be fun.
[50:53.300 --> 50:54.840]  Okay, well, I'm having a great time.
[50:58.200 --> 50:59.140]  What is that?
[51:00.040 --> 51:01.860]  Why are there ghosts on my thing now?
[51:01.900 --> 51:04.380]  You gotta hit them to stop them, but then they knock your piece off.
[51:04.380 --> 51:05.420]  Oh, no, they killed it.
[51:05.420 --> 51:05.900]  Yes, they do.
[51:06.040 --> 51:07.440]  Those little...
[51:07.440 --> 51:08.140]  Yeah, they kill it.
[51:08.460 --> 51:08.880]  They're bad.
[51:09.660 --> 51:12.080]  I'm not familiar with those ghosts, but not a fan.
[51:12.380 --> 51:14.100]  I am afraid of those ghosts, it turns out.
[51:14.420 --> 51:15.360]  Oh, there goes Eric.
[51:15.360 --> 51:16.480]  Nope, I'm still in.
[51:16.560 --> 51:16.800]  Okay.
[51:19.480 --> 51:20.460]  That was funny, Nick.
[51:20.680 --> 51:21.060]  Thank you, man.
[51:22.900 --> 51:24.400]  I can shoot it off just in time.
[51:25.000 --> 51:25.920]  Damn, I'm out.
[51:27.760 --> 51:30.300]  Oh, it was just a fucking dickhead.
[51:30.700 --> 51:31.840]  Oh, goodbye, old friend.
[51:32.880 --> 51:33.880]  Oh my god, I can't see.
[51:37.820 --> 51:38.740]  I can't see!
[51:39.120 --> 51:42.600]  Oh, Andrew is panicking, but he still does it.
[51:42.960 --> 51:43.900]  Way to go.
[51:44.120 --> 51:45.000]  I couldn't see!
[51:48.280 --> 51:49.380]  Get out of here.
[51:49.760 --> 51:50.160]  Damn.
[51:50.440 --> 51:51.360]  Oh, Andrew's one away.
[51:51.500 --> 51:52.300]  Oh, just give me...
[51:52.300 --> 51:53.600]  All he needs is bronze.
[51:54.180 --> 51:54.960]  All he needs is bronze.
[51:55.340 --> 51:56.080]  That's all he needs.
[51:56.840 --> 51:57.720]  He just needs third.
[51:58.440 --> 52:01.640]  Oh, and he's really coming to his own on this one.
[52:01.880 --> 52:02.760]  Okay, here we go.
[52:05.250 --> 52:07.370]  Okay, I know how I want to do this.
[52:08.670 --> 52:09.470]  Ah, bollocks.
[52:16.890 --> 52:17.950]  I'm gonna try this.
[52:19.270 --> 52:21.170]  Oh, that's an interesting strategy.
[52:26.520 --> 52:27.200]  What am I doing?
[52:29.020 --> 52:30.020]  I fucked it.
[52:30.200 --> 52:32.340]  I'm gonna fucking not get any points here.
[52:32.580 --> 52:32.680]  Stay.
[52:32.780 --> 52:33.920]  I'm gonna blow this.
[52:34.060 --> 52:35.700]  I'm gonna blow this so bad.
[52:36.560 --> 52:38.000]  We have to kill...
[52:38.560 --> 52:42.880]  Guys, I gotta think that Andrew probably just blew it.
[52:43.360 --> 52:44.100]  So bad.
[52:46.840 --> 52:47.360]  Stupid.
[52:49.340 --> 52:51.020]  Oh, can I squeeze this through?
[52:51.160 --> 52:52.960]  I may have boned myself just now.
[52:53.520 --> 52:54.240]  I don't want to try.
[52:54.940 --> 52:55.780]  I'm good there.
[52:56.520 --> 52:57.780]  Feeling good about that.
[53:06.790 --> 53:08.290]  That's it for Andrew.
[53:09.150 --> 53:09.710]  Fuck.
[53:11.650 --> 53:14.210]  Oh, Andrew, you might still take third.
[53:14.750 --> 53:16.010]  Oh, Nick.
[53:16.310 --> 53:16.730]  No.
[53:17.030 --> 53:18.430]  He only has four pieces.
[53:18.870 --> 53:19.050]  No.
[53:19.530 --> 53:22.130]  Andrew, Nick just handed it to you.
[53:22.670 --> 53:23.370]  I have five.
[53:23.750 --> 53:26.370]  Hey, Nick, thanks for throwing it.
[53:26.550 --> 53:27.470]  Andrew, you're welcome.
[53:27.750 --> 53:29.350]  I threw it just for Andrew.
[53:29.350 --> 53:30.750]  I wanted him to get in on it.
[53:30.790 --> 53:31.570]  That's good shit.
[53:31.970 --> 53:32.170]  Five!
[53:34.770 --> 53:35.490]  Eleven pieces.
[53:35.970 --> 53:38.630]  Oh, you get that winner away from your name.
[53:38.930 --> 53:40.330]  We got a real winner over here.
[53:40.470 --> 53:42.070]  Wild. That's so funny.
[53:42.890 --> 53:46.110]  Andrew, I just wanted to say, I got your back.
[53:46.650 --> 53:47.290]  Thanks so much.
[53:47.290 --> 53:48.250]  I got your back, Nick.
[53:48.290 --> 53:48.950]  You got my back.
[53:49.050 --> 53:49.890]  We got a bunch of backs.
[53:50.050 --> 53:50.690]  Way to go.
[53:51.030 --> 53:52.210]  Yeah, they got each other's backs.
[53:52.290 --> 53:54.270]  Their hands are reaching around to their fronts, Geoff.
[53:54.730 --> 53:55.810]  I see that.
[53:55.950 --> 53:56.470]  Listen, I'm a giver.
[53:56.610 --> 53:56.990]  I'm a giver.
[53:57.490 --> 53:57.890]  Very friendly.
[53:57.890 --> 53:59.210]  Yeah, real friendly.
[53:59.290 --> 54:00.030]  I'm a giver.
[54:00.530 --> 54:02.150]  Last game, last game, last game.
[54:02.150 --> 54:02.630]  One more.
[54:03.050 --> 54:04.690]  Last game, no handjobs.
[54:04.770 --> 54:06.030]  Last game, no handjobs.
[54:06.110 --> 54:06.570]  Everybody playing with their own wheels.
[54:06.570 --> 54:07.310]  Feel good about this, guys.
[54:07.490 --> 54:10.570]  Thanks for watching every Friday, 4 p.m. Central.
[54:10.690 --> 54:11.690]  We're streaming on Twitch.
[54:11.830 --> 54:12.150]  That's 2 p.m. Pacific.
[54:12.150 --> 54:12.850]  We're gonna go tippy-top.
[54:13.050 --> 54:14.090]  We're gonna go all the way up top.
[54:14.370 --> 54:16.010]  5 p.m. Eastern.
[54:16.210 --> 54:16.930]  Are we Jack buddies?
[54:17.150 --> 54:17.630]  What's going on?
[54:18.370 --> 54:18.970]  What'd you say?
[54:19.150 --> 54:19.370]  What?
[54:19.750 --> 54:21.090]  Nick's getting weird, man.
[54:21.450 --> 54:23.090]  Nick's going back to college.
[54:23.590 --> 54:23.970]  No.
[54:24.670 --> 54:29.850]  I found out that Nick got his tattoo on like his first day of college.
[54:30.730 --> 54:31.250]  Orientation.
[54:32.070 --> 54:33.630]  Oh, it wasn't even your first day.
[54:33.790 --> 54:34.530]  It was just orientation.
[54:34.590 --> 54:35.270]  Yeah, it was just orientation.
[54:37.070 --> 54:37.970]  Hook him, bud.
[54:38.390 --> 54:38.770]  Yeah, man.
[54:38.970 --> 54:40.250]  Don't regret it at all.
[54:41.290 --> 54:41.550]  Wink.
[54:44.010 --> 54:45.050]  That's fucking...
[54:45.050 --> 54:46.790]  This is fucking...
[54:46.790 --> 54:47.390]  Have balloon.
[54:47.590 --> 54:48.690]  Just a nightmare.
[54:49.490 --> 54:51.730]  Boy, that balloon's hard to dodge.
[54:52.490 --> 54:53.250]  Sure is.
[54:53.250 --> 54:53.970]  Oh, no. Twisty.
[54:54.470 --> 54:55.330]  Why don't you guys take him?
[54:56.630 --> 54:57.430]  I don't like Twisty.
[54:57.550 --> 54:59.670]  You know what? Just take away all of my tower.
[55:00.290 --> 55:01.810]  Let's just start from scratch.
[55:02.030 --> 55:02.970]  Hey, I should have done that.
[55:04.510 --> 55:05.510]  Oh, wait. I forgot.
[55:05.570 --> 55:06.230]  Oh, my God.
[55:06.310 --> 55:07.930]  Can we stop for a minute?
[55:09.150 --> 55:10.510]  Oh, this fucking balloon.
[55:10.730 --> 55:11.170]  Fuckers.
[55:11.910 --> 55:13.070]  Stop with the Twisty.
[55:13.650 --> 55:14.430]  Oh, my God.
[55:15.230 --> 55:18.010]  The Twisty balloon is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
[55:18.010 --> 55:21.550]  There we go.
[55:23.310 --> 55:23.710]  Um...
[55:23.710 --> 55:24.650]  Fuckin' idiot.
[55:25.350 --> 55:26.390]  Yeah, you made it.
[55:26.890 --> 55:27.130]  Yeah.
[55:27.290 --> 55:27.430]  What?
[55:27.830 --> 55:29.770]  All right, seriously, who's doing the fuckin' Twisty balloons?
[55:30.590 --> 55:30.890]  Hey.
[55:31.570 --> 55:32.470]  Here, have a balloon.
[55:32.990 --> 55:33.510]  God, you're such a...
[55:33.510 --> 55:34.210]  You got a mother...
[55:34.210 --> 55:34.790]  I fuck!
[55:36.010 --> 55:36.630]  Here, have a balloon.
[55:37.310 --> 55:37.630]  No!
[55:38.030 --> 55:38.950]  Get away from me!
[55:39.030 --> 55:39.910]  I avoided it, Nick.
[55:40.070 --> 55:40.950]  I've done that before.
[55:41.110 --> 55:42.070]  But not this time.
[55:42.290 --> 55:44.110]  That's the first time I've ever done that.
[55:45.850 --> 55:46.650]  I really...
[55:46.650 --> 55:47.990]  Until that just now, I didn't know you could do that.
[55:47.990 --> 55:49.050]  I didn't know you could avoid the balloon.
[55:49.510 --> 55:49.790]  Yeah.
[55:52.970 --> 55:53.250]  This...
[55:53.730 --> 55:55.130]  You stupid prick.
[55:56.730 --> 55:57.550]  Not you.
[55:58.150 --> 55:59.350]  I'm talking to me.
[56:02.050 --> 56:02.890]  Oh, man.
[56:04.210 --> 56:05.730]  Not you, stupid prick.
[56:05.910 --> 56:06.550]  Me, you stupid prick.
[56:06.550 --> 56:07.290]  Yeah, me, you stupid prick.
[56:07.550 --> 56:07.590]  Yeah.
[56:08.170 --> 56:08.750]  What are you, dumb?
[56:09.050 --> 56:09.690]  What's this one do?
[56:12.490 --> 56:13.190]  Fucks me?
[56:13.310 --> 56:13.770]  You're...
[56:13.770 --> 56:14.430]  You're just...
[56:14.430 --> 56:15.270]  You're just...
[56:15.270 --> 56:16.930]  You're just subhuman.
[56:16.930 --> 56:17.670]  Look at you.
[56:18.770 --> 56:19.410]  Subhuman.
[56:19.830 --> 56:20.650]  Look at...
[56:20.650 --> 56:21.430]  Look at you.
[56:21.750 --> 56:22.550]  Oh, no!
[56:23.130 --> 56:23.930]  Oh, no!
[56:24.630 --> 56:25.610]  Oh, that's the worst.
[56:25.950 --> 56:26.350]  That's...
[56:26.790 --> 56:27.110]  Wait.
[56:27.350 --> 56:28.770]  My whole tower went.
[56:30.030 --> 56:31.810]  It gave me the piano again.
[56:33.550 --> 56:34.190]  No!
[56:35.290 --> 56:35.870]  You know what?
[56:35.910 --> 56:36.330]  I can be...
[56:36.330 --> 56:37.210]  We can rebuild.
[56:38.250 --> 56:40.490]  Oh, I don't like the way this is going.
[56:40.990 --> 56:41.850]  Oh, man.
[56:42.030 --> 56:43.730]  This is bad news.
[56:44.610 --> 56:45.690]  What does this one do?
[56:46.530 --> 56:48.630]  Stop doing that!
[56:52.520 --> 56:55.340]  That was legitimate bad news.
[56:55.700 --> 56:55.940]  Yeah.
[56:56.860 --> 56:57.720]  You're a bear.
[56:58.440 --> 56:59.900]  How you doing over there, Andrew?
[57:00.380 --> 57:00.720]  Awful.
[57:01.080 --> 57:01.500]  Awful.
[57:02.880 --> 57:04.640]  Whoever just used the spin, that's fine.
[57:04.780 --> 57:05.100]  I just...
[57:05.100 --> 57:06.460]  I had it on a square piece.
[57:06.460 --> 57:07.140]  Oh, my God.
[57:07.480 --> 57:08.220]  Great, great, great.
[57:11.960 --> 57:13.000]  All right.
[57:13.560 --> 57:14.100]  Could have been worse.
[57:15.180 --> 57:17.100]  Oh, I haven't made any progress.
[57:17.560 --> 57:17.960]  No.
[57:18.220 --> 57:18.780]  In years.
[57:19.560 --> 57:20.080]  No progress.
[57:22.100 --> 57:22.500]  Ooh.
[57:23.080 --> 57:23.480]  Ooh.
[57:24.000 --> 57:24.400]  Ooh.
[57:24.920 --> 57:25.260]  Go.
[57:25.600 --> 57:25.820]  Nope.
[57:26.080 --> 57:26.520]  I had it.
[57:26.620 --> 57:26.760]  Build.
[57:26.840 --> 57:27.360]  I had it.
[57:27.600 --> 57:28.000]  Build.
[57:28.120 --> 57:29.080]  Had it and I blew it.
[57:29.420 --> 57:29.820]  Boys.
[57:30.640 --> 57:31.100]  Had it and I blew it.
[57:31.100 --> 57:31.340]  Hold.
[57:32.980 --> 57:33.300]  No!
[57:33.480 --> 57:34.340]  Oh, Nick!
[57:34.660 --> 57:34.980]  No!
[57:35.620 --> 57:36.340]  Look at that...
[57:36.340 --> 57:37.840]  Look at those double Ls.
[57:37.880 --> 57:38.840]  That was the worst I've ever done.
[57:39.340 --> 57:39.720]  Had it.
[57:39.780 --> 57:40.780]  Had it and I blew it, guys.
[57:42.160 --> 57:43.840]  Sorry for everyone who put money on me.
[57:43.880 --> 57:44.420]  I apologize.
[57:44.420 --> 57:47.060]  I feel like Gavin on that one.
[57:50.660 --> 57:51.100]  Goddamn.
[57:52.600 --> 57:53.320]  Oh, man.
[57:55.820 --> 57:58.420]  You do okay for a while and then you just start fucking sucking.
[58:00.660 --> 58:01.560]  That's how it goes, bud.
[58:01.920 --> 58:04.060]  You just get bad at everything all at once.
[58:10.600 --> 58:11.640]  Do I want it?
[58:12.480 --> 58:12.920]  No.
[58:13.140 --> 58:13.380]  Yes.
[58:13.500 --> 58:13.720]  No.
[58:13.860 --> 58:14.100]  No.
[58:18.330 --> 58:20.170]  Oh, I like that, Nick.
[58:20.170 --> 58:21.110]  That's good thinking.
[58:22.590 --> 58:23.550]  He said to himself.
[58:24.430 --> 58:25.910]  Yeah, Nick's talking to himself again.
[58:26.290 --> 58:27.510]  Oh, this is how it goes.
[58:28.170 --> 58:28.570]  What?
[58:32.790 --> 58:33.490]  Come on.
[58:33.730 --> 58:34.410]  Lock in here.
[58:34.990 --> 58:35.130]  Go.
[58:35.510 --> 58:35.770]  Oh.
[58:36.210 --> 58:39.530]  Ooh, a tall piece that's gonna fuck me.
[58:39.590 --> 58:41.570]  I fucked myself in the goat ass.
[58:42.150 --> 58:46.430]  Yeah, I think that's it for me, boys.
[58:46.530 --> 58:47.390]  I think I just gotta...
[58:47.390 --> 58:48.470]  I think I gotta call it.
[58:48.550 --> 58:50.190]  I wanna put it on the outside, but it's too risky.
[58:50.610 --> 58:51.310]  Okay, locked in.
[58:51.970 --> 58:52.670]  Let's see.
[58:54.410 --> 58:54.850]  Ah!
[58:55.630 --> 58:56.890]  Nick, what happened to your vines?
[58:57.670 --> 58:58.470]  We had a good time.
[58:59.270 --> 58:59.730]  Oh, no.
[59:01.430 --> 59:01.870]  Yep.
[59:03.230 --> 59:05.310]  Ooh, that's a tough one, Nick.
[59:05.430 --> 59:06.350]  That's gonna end it.
[59:06.390 --> 59:07.090]  You should've laid it flat.
[59:07.250 --> 59:07.810]  Yep, should've.
[59:07.870 --> 59:08.330]  You had it.
[59:08.750 --> 59:10.550]  Ooh, Andrew, good spot.
[59:11.750 --> 59:12.650]  Ooh, oh, Andrew.
[59:12.650 --> 59:13.190]  Way to go.
[59:13.850 --> 59:15.970]  Oh, where do you go from here?
[59:17.390 --> 59:19.130]  Where do we go now?
[59:19.710 --> 59:20.010]  Hold!
[59:25.230 --> 59:26.630]  There you go, you got it.
[59:26.790 --> 59:27.130]  You got it.
[59:27.910 --> 59:28.670]  All right, well...
[59:28.670 --> 59:29.730]  I got one back at least.
[59:30.130 --> 59:30.890]  Yeah, yeah, you got it.
[59:31.010 --> 59:31.550]  Yeah, you got it.
[59:32.810 --> 59:35.550]  Yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[59:35.610 --> 59:36.010]  Wow!
[59:36.890 --> 59:37.690]  That eliminates...
[59:37.690 --> 59:38.310]  Oh, wow.
[59:38.730 --> 59:41.470]  You got lucky that it only eliminated that one that was falling.
[59:41.830 --> 59:42.790]  Yeah, how did that work?
[59:43.470 --> 59:46.470]  Because if it would've moved up, it would've wiped your three, I think.
[59:47.950 --> 59:48.350]  Yep.
[59:52.500 --> 59:56.840]  All right, me and Nick tied for first place in the last game of the day.
[59:57.020 --> 59:58.380]  We can't allow this shit to happen, Andrew.
[59:58.380 --> 59:59.760]  Excited to end the week with a huge win.
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.360]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.440]  Andrew, we can't let this shit happen.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:02.920]  We really appreciate it.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.740]  We sure do love you.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.560]  Are you doing your wrestling this weekend, Eric?
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.400]  Yeah, I have AAPW tomorrow at 8 p.m. Central.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:10.980]  I'll be on commentary.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.580]  You'll be streaming it?
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.560]  Yeah, official AAPW on Twitch.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.360]  If you want to hear me call some wrestling, it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.440]  Some of the best wrestling that you will hear and see in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:29.220]  Dude, we did that streaming thing with, I think, Falcon Tier and above, where we watched you do that.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.160]  And I had so much fucking fun.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:38.580]  And I was really impressed at the quality of wrestling.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:39.760]  Thank you.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.220]  Why? You're not wrestling? It had nothing to do with you.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:43.940]  No, no, no.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.680]  I'm saying thank you.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:46.860]  Thank you.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:52.460]  Because we work really hard to have those guys get better week in and week out.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.920]  Because they're all in their early 20s.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.600]  And most of those guys have been wrestling for like six months.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.060]  They're really good.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.040]  Yeah, they are.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.000]  They're great.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.260]  Really, really fun to watch.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.460]  I appreciate that. That's awesome.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.620]  I'm trying to get Gavin to film them in slow motion.
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:07.640]  I think that would be really cool.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.280]  Hell yeah.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.740]  I think that would be awesome.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.180]  I was also surprised there were so many musical performances.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.400]  Yeah, that's new.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.440]  We don't do that, and I don't know that we're doing that again.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.080]  There was a moment on stream...
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:20.340]  That was new.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.660]  There was a moment on stream we had that I laughed about for about a week after.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:25.760]  I'm not sure the other guys remember.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.720]  When we watched that guy's mic cut out for like a song and a half.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.480]  We went into that.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.020]  And then...
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.840]  I asked Derek about that immediately, Geoff.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:34.800]  Oh, did you?
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.060]  I need you guys to know... I just eliminated myself.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.680]  I need you guys to know that we went over like...
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.840]  Okay, here's how the mic works.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.560]  Just don't turn it off.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.480]  They all turned it off.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.740]  I don't know...
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.540]  Your only job is to rap into the microphone.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.140]  They kept turning it off.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:50.440]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.260]  After it was all over, he goes...
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:53.940]  Nick was...
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.080]  He goes, Eric was standing there watching the whole time, right?
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.160]  And I go, yeah, you can see him off camera.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:57.840]  And he goes...
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.920]  He had a microphone in his hand, right?
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.960]  Dude, the mics worked.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.080]  They kept holding the button to turn them off.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.780]  It was the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.000]  That's an experience.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.660]  They're getting their reps in.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:13.880]  That's what happens.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.560]  But I appreciated you guys watching.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.420]  I thought that was really...
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.100]  I thought that was really cool.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:20.580]  It was fun, man.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.380]  Oh, hell yeah, dude.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.680]  We had a really good time.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.940]  I don't know why I did that.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.820]  I think I tried to get too tricky.
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.340]  I think I tried to get too tricky with this one.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.700]  And it's not working out for me.
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.300]  I'm locked in now.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.880]  Whatever I do next.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.000]  That's stupid.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.440]  What a stupid move that was.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.340]  That's dummy.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.100]  I ain't giving this shit home.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.640]  Nobody's gonna...
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.760]  Listen, Andrew.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.420]  Nobody's gonna out-stupid me on this.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.320]  You idiot!
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.680]  You fool!
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.460]  I've been playing...
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.360]  I finally got it working.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.140]  But I'm doing this GM mode thing with two buddies in that WWE game.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.100]  You draft wrestlers.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:07.900]  You have a budget.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.760]  And you're trying to book shows that are better than your friend's shows.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.620]  And you get these cards that can like...
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.740]  You can like fuck up what they're trying to do.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.620]  It's great.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.540]  It's so much fun.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.320]  I just...
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.820]  We did like the first episode.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.480]  It's a fucking blast.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.860]  I did not think I was gonna like it.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:23.800]  It's so much fun.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:28.000]  Do you think that would be a kind of thing we could do on like Fuck Face Off or something someday?
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.980]  I think once I figure out the ins and outs.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.720]  And I can like walk you guys through it.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.280]  I think it's something we should at least try.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:34.960]  Okay.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.340]  I think it's a lot of fun.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:36.680]  That sounds fun.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:37.360]  Yep.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.160]  Ten...
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:40.360]  Thirteen!
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.080]  That was amazing, Nick.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:43.300]  Shit.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.420]  He was closing in on the world record of sixteen.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:47.560]  Yeah.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.880]  And he only needs a silver to take it home for the weekend.
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:51.540]  Oh, baby.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.960]  God damn, Nick.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.380]  I want it.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:53.940]  I want it bad.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.600]  No for Eric.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:57.540]  No.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.360]  Let's see.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.440]  We'll do that there.
[01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:16.250]  We doing Sloppy Joe's Bingo next weekend?
[01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:16.610]  Is that right?
[01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.390]  I think we're gonna try to.
[01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:20.930]  We'll have more information kind of like as the week goes.
[01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.590]  But I think that's the plan.
[01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:27.850]  And we're gonna have some bonus content that Andrew came up with that goes along with it that I kept thinking about.
[01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:29.350]  And I think is a really, really good idea.
[01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.870]  Okay.
[01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.230]  Yeah.
[01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:35.570]  We'll narrow that down this weekend and then have more information about it early next week.
[01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:37.030]  We all just bummed each other.
[01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:38.270]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.790]  Oh, you dick.
[01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.410]  So stay tuned.
[01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.790]  You get a regulatory on if you want to check out what's going on.
[01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:51.070]  What are you laughing at, Nick?
[01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:53.230]  Oh, you dick.
[01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:55.170]  It's not appreciated.
[01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:55.750]  Uh-oh.
[01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:56.810]  Uh-oh.
[01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:57.430]  Uh-oh.
[01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:58.390]  Daddy's in trouble.
[01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:02.910]  Do you guys like bubbles?
[01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.990]  No.
[01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:05.890]  I'm sorry.
[01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:06.650]  I thought you liked...
[01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:07.470]  I messed up.
[01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:08.390]  I thought you liked...
[01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:11.910]  I actually survived that okay.
[01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:12.430]  Oh, good.
[01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.750]  I thought...
[01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:14.850]  I messed up.
[01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.150]  I thought you liked them.
[01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:17.050]  That's on me.
[01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:17.650]  You guys like balloons?
[01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.730]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:20.650]  I'm fine with balloons.
[01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:21.230]  Thank you.
[01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.750]  You're welcome.
[01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:25.510]  Actually gave me more time to think about what I wanted to do.
[01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:26.710]  Goodbye.
[01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:30.010]  Oh, you stupid dummy.
[01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:32.190]  You big stupid dummy idiot.
[01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:35.150]  You stupid dummy stupid face.
[01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:36.230]  Are you talking about Nick?
[01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:37.290]  Yeah, he's talking about me.
[01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:38.110]  Big dummy stupid...
[01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:38.850]  I'm talking about Gavin.
[01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.810]  Fucking dummy.
[01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:44.570]  That I believe.
[01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:46.010]  He didn't miss a beat.
[01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.990]  That was so good.
[01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:48.030]  Oh, that was good.
[01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:48.730]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:49.350]  Oh, damn.
[01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:50.890]  Oh, my whole tower.
[01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:52.270]  Oh, boys.
[01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.290]  All the way to fourth place.
[01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:55.050]  I need to...
[01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:57.130]  I have five blocks on the board.
[01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:00.150]  I have five blocks on the board.
[01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:03.890]  I don't even know what to do.
[01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.890]  I don't...
[01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:05.690]  I don't even know what to do.
[01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.690]  No.
[01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.830]  No.
[01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:09.730]  Come back in a second.
[01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:11.490]  Come back in a century starts now.
[01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:12.870]  Oh, dear.
[01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:14.150]  Why is it gotta be ice?
[01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:17.270]  Oh, dear.
[01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:19.690]  It held.
[01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:20.490]  Oh, not long.
[01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:26.030]  No, my tower.
[01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:28.730]  It keeps moving.
[01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:29.470]  Is this...
[01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:32.150]  I'm about to put a piece down and it just shifts.
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:35.510]  Oh, Christ.
[01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.630]  Oh, extra Christ.
[01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:41.450]  Oh.
[01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:44.810]  Shrub me.
[01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:45.630]  I don't give a fuck.
[01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:46.450]  It doesn't mean shit.
[01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:47.710]  No, goodbye.
[01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:48.810]  Shrubs, I'm invincible to shrubs.
[01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:49.830]  I'm so fucking low.
[01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:50.750]  I'm in the shrubs.
[01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:52.370]  I am the shrubs.
[01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.710]  Have a balloon.
[01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:53.990]  No, no, I'm not.
[01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:54.310]  Okay.
[01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:55.110]  Okay, good.
[01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:57.890]  Can you fucking balloon me right now?
[01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.590]  Yeah.
[01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:00.170]  Oh, you dick.
[01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:02.090]  At my daughter's wedding.
[01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.030]  You're gonna balloon me?
[01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:05.310]  Oh, I fucked that up.
[01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:06.230]  I fucked that up, Geoff.
[01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:06.890]  Why?
[01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:08.230]  Make a win-win.
[01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:09.030]  All you need is silver.
[01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.270]  One, one.
[01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.090]  Go, go, go.
[01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:11.450]  No.
[01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:12.790]  It didn't make it.
[01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:13.930]  It didn't make it.
[01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:14.570]  Keep going.
[01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:15.870]  I need second.
[01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:17.190]  I need second.
[01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:17.570]  First.
[01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.770]  Come on, Nick.
[01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:19.790]  You're right there.
[01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.290]  Yeah, hold it.
[01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.830]  Fuck.
[01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:24.350]  No way.
[01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:26.950]  Nick wins.
[01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.830]  What a way to go into the weekend.
[01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:32.090]  Oh, I'm so happy.
[01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:36.210]  With Eric never winning again.
[01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:37.510]  Damn, wow.
[01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:38.830]  We did it, Andrew.
[01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.110]  Andrew, that's crazy.
[01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.290]  You know, it takes three people to beat me.
[01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:43.590]  I'm really proud of you guys.
[01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:44.770]  It takes three people to beat me.
[01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:45.850]  You guys did a great job.
[01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:47.970]  This is not Calum L.
[01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:49.790]  Thank you so much for 5gifted.
[01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.450]  What a win from Nick.
[01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.010]  Huge stuff here.
[01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:54.570]  Man, what a win, Nick.

[01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.130]  Yeah, no, I'm not quitting.
[01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.850]  I'm just declaring it.
[01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:06.350]  We need to end and not have the game go.
[01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:07.910]  So it's like, yeah, I backed out.
[01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:10.470]  I'm just declaring because sometimes it happens.
[01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:11.770]  I'm not the one.
[01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:11.870]  Who?
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:12.850]  Not me.
