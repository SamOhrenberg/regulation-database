[00:00.000 --> 00:02.700]  Your organization is called an organization?
[00:03.300 --> 00:03.800]  I like it.
[00:03.800 --> 00:06.160]  No, I mean that... that makes sense.
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.000]  Regulation organization.
[00:08.140 --> 00:09.340]  You would have thought it would have been something like that.
[00:09.380 --> 00:10.440]  Mine's called Fecal Becal.
[00:12.580 --> 00:14.080]  Oh, I lost the cops so fast.
[00:14.100 --> 00:16.700]  Hello and welcome to another regulation heist.
[00:17.600 --> 00:18.800]  That's how this goes.
[00:18.980 --> 00:20.300]  I was talking about losing the cops.
[00:20.660 --> 00:21.800]  Yeah, well, listen, the cops are always...
[00:21.800 --> 00:22.880]  He just kind of did it out of nowhere.
[00:23.140 --> 00:24.780]  Series A Trash Truck. Well, that's how it goes.
[00:24.860 --> 00:26.380]  I guess I could have made...
[00:26.380 --> 00:27.600]  Oh, Good Kids Show, Trash Truck.
[00:27.820 --> 00:29.240]  Is Trash Truck a kids show?
[00:29.660 --> 00:29.820]  Yeah.
[00:29.820 --> 00:32.000]  You could have said, all right, guys, you ready to start?
[00:32.100 --> 00:34.220]  Oh, it was clear. I could feel it in the room we were ready.
[00:34.540 --> 00:37.000]  And that was a bad read based on what I immediately...
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.020]  You didn't know if I was in the game.
[00:38.220 --> 00:43.200]  Yeah, but then we established you were and you joined my crew,
[00:43.500 --> 00:47.460]  which I felt really cleared up your ability to be in my session.
[00:49.160 --> 00:50.660]  I'm going to auto invite.
[00:52.180 --> 00:53.180]  There it goes.
[00:53.780 --> 00:54.000]  Sweet.
[00:54.440 --> 00:55.220]  That was textbook.
[00:56.100 --> 00:56.940]  Series of Funding.
[00:57.840 --> 00:59.100]  Series of Funding.
[01:01.100 --> 01:03.340]  Yeah, the last time it was a series of cocaine.
[01:03.720 --> 01:03.840]  Yeah.
[01:03.900 --> 01:05.340]  So now what are we doing? A series?
[01:05.540 --> 01:05.880]  Let's find out.
[01:06.020 --> 01:06.840]  A series of Trash Truck.
[01:07.300 --> 01:08.320]  Oh, it is a series of Trash Truck.
[01:08.940 --> 01:09.880]  Yeah, I'm not making up a joke.
[01:09.960 --> 01:13.560]  I mean, it just sounded like a thing that you were making up.
[01:14.480 --> 01:17.040]  Did I just spend $27,000 on ammo?
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.480]  I think our percentages should be based on how much we're putting in money wise.
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.940]  Oh, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and disagree with that
[01:27.940 --> 01:32.320]  because you keep buying all your ammo and then using rockets and bombs.
[01:32.840 --> 01:37.280]  And I'm using I'm using a special carbine almost exclusively.
[01:37.540 --> 01:37.740]  Yeah.
[01:37.860 --> 01:38.820]  So let me ask you this.
[01:38.860 --> 01:41.160]  Are my rockets and bombs killing bad guys?
[01:41.400 --> 01:42.360]  I guess.
[01:42.400 --> 01:46.100]  I don't know if they're killing them any better than my special carbine has been.
[01:46.240 --> 01:46.720]  That's fair.
[01:46.800 --> 01:48.840]  And to be fair, one of my bombs stuck to the door frame.
[01:50.240 --> 01:52.300]  You threw it and it just went right above us.
[01:52.360 --> 01:54.160]  And it was just, I was going, please don't blow up, please don't blow up.
[01:58.360 --> 01:58.800]  God.
[01:59.440 --> 02:01.620]  All right, I'm ready for a series of trash trucks to start.
[02:01.720 --> 02:02.540]  Yeah, me too.
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.360]  Oh, we got collectors and operators.
[02:06.480 --> 02:07.580]  Now I'm also waiting.
[02:07.660 --> 02:08.620]  Mine's just launching session.
[02:08.740 --> 02:09.680]  It's still thinking about it.
[02:10.620 --> 02:11.500]  Launching session.
[02:11.760 --> 02:12.360]  How about you, Gavin?
[02:12.780 --> 02:13.020]  What?
[02:15.280 --> 02:16.720]  You collecting or operating?
[02:16.960 --> 02:18.160]  OK, are you?
[02:18.220 --> 02:20.880]  I'm trying to figure out if he's pissed again.
[02:23.900 --> 02:24.780]  It's pungent.
[02:26.420 --> 02:27.160]  Little shit.
[02:27.160 --> 02:28.320]  All right, I'm joining.
[02:28.520 --> 02:30.260]  I'm joining collectors over here with Gavin.
[02:30.440 --> 02:30.780]  OK.
[02:30.980 --> 02:31.600]  Oh, hell yeah.
[02:31.720 --> 02:32.860]  Outfit is the trash.
[02:33.560 --> 02:34.520]  You're going to do the trash?
[02:34.640 --> 02:35.940]  I think I'm also doing the trash.
[02:37.640 --> 02:39.120]  All right, we'll be collectors then.
[02:40.100 --> 02:40.640]  Oh, we collect.
[02:41.240 --> 02:42.580]  Wait, no, you guys are operators.
[02:43.300 --> 02:44.700]  Oh, I see your outfit.
[02:44.900 --> 02:45.380]  I understand.
[02:46.000 --> 02:46.580]  I get it.
[02:47.140 --> 02:48.140]  We're simply the trash.
[02:48.340 --> 02:49.200]  They knew what we were.
[02:49.220 --> 02:49.820]  We're being ironic.
[02:54.220 --> 02:54.860]  It's great.
[02:54.860 --> 02:57.460]  What can I put my rat mask back on?
[02:57.680 --> 02:57.900]  Rat mammoth?
[02:58.900 --> 03:00.880]  Oh, cool.
[03:01.020 --> 03:03.420]  You weren't paying attention to the rest of everything you were saying.
[03:04.460 --> 03:05.680]  I hear a flub.
[03:05.760 --> 03:06.680]  My ears perk up.
[03:06.980 --> 03:08.600]  Gavin's always listening for mistakes.
[03:09.240 --> 03:09.740]  Oh, all right.
[03:10.120 --> 03:10.420]  No!
[03:13.100 --> 03:18.600]  Sorry, I saw a motorcycle.
[03:18.840 --> 03:19.360]  It had to be killed.
[03:19.520 --> 03:21.080]  We have to commandeer our own vehicle, Eric.
[03:21.640 --> 03:22.620]  Yes, yes, we...
[03:22.620 --> 03:23.760]  Oh, no, Gavin.
[03:23.960 --> 03:24.720]  Where's your car?
[03:25.260 --> 03:25.860]  I don't know.
[03:25.900 --> 03:26.740]  I don't have a car.
[03:26.900 --> 03:28.480]  You didn't bring any vehicle?
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.840]  No, why would I bring a vehicle?
[03:30.300 --> 03:31.120]  It's probably destroyed.
[03:31.920 --> 03:32.280]  Oh, cool.
[03:32.340 --> 03:33.720]  We're both in our own vehicles.
[03:34.240 --> 03:36.240]  Okay, yours looks nicer, but I'll follow...
[03:36.660 --> 03:37.240]  Yes, go.
[03:37.620 --> 03:39.160]  I was gonna say I'll follow you.
[03:39.480 --> 03:39.980]  I'll follow you.
[03:40.080 --> 03:41.600]  You guys haven't even left yet.
[03:42.500 --> 03:43.800]  Guys, I don't know about...
[03:43.800 --> 03:46.840]  Hey, on this one, I'm not sure about half this team.
[03:47.120 --> 03:47.900]  This might not be good.
[03:51.840 --> 03:54.820]  Team Tape might be like cat piss drunk.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  Like, it's not good.
[03:56.080 --> 03:56.500]  Oh, shit.
[03:56.840 --> 03:58.780]  Yeah, I drove over the top of a car.
[03:59.700 --> 04:01.920]  Team Tape's been sitting in a hot car too long.
[04:03.300 --> 04:05.480]  Well, we were on the back of a scooter.
[04:05.620 --> 04:06.680]  We kept throwing each other off.
[04:07.100 --> 04:09.080]  I'm just hot boxed by piss.
[04:10.620 --> 04:11.660]  Open a window.
[04:11.960 --> 04:13.620]  It's not that hot outside yet.
[04:13.740 --> 04:14.140]  Is it not?
[04:14.620 --> 04:14.900]  No.
[04:15.140 --> 04:15.900]  No, it's like...
[04:15.900 --> 04:16.320]  It's 80.
[04:16.740 --> 04:17.040]  It's 80.
[04:17.040 --> 04:18.100]  It's like gloomy.
[04:18.220 --> 04:19.380]  It's a little bit humid, though.
[04:19.400 --> 04:22.320]  And I'm worried the piss particles will cling to the humidity and just...
[04:22.320 --> 04:22.700]  Oh, man.
[04:22.720 --> 04:23.280]  Yeah, man.
[04:23.460 --> 04:26.480]  Yeah, it's gonna be so much worse.
[04:26.740 --> 04:27.700]  Like, what are you talking about?
[04:29.320 --> 04:30.560]  Where are we supposed to...
[04:30.560 --> 04:31.420]  Oh, Trashmaster?
[04:31.640 --> 04:33.120]  We're getting the trash van.
[04:33.340 --> 04:35.000]  Oh, we're supposed to kill these guys, aren't we?
[04:36.280 --> 04:36.820]  Are we?
[04:36.940 --> 04:37.600]  Oh, yeah, we are.
[04:37.660 --> 04:38.100]  Oh, shit.
[04:40.040 --> 04:41.780]  Well, at least it's not us having the problem.
[04:43.040 --> 04:43.640]  No problem.
[04:44.940 --> 04:46.760]  So, we all go into the same place?
[04:46.760 --> 04:47.940]  Oh, there's one guy left alive.
[04:47.980 --> 04:48.640]  I'll get him.
[04:48.820 --> 04:49.920]  It appears so.
[04:50.360 --> 04:52.180]  I didn't know that, but yes.
[04:52.980 --> 04:53.700]  All right.
[04:55.760 --> 04:56.640]  What is that?
[04:56.640 --> 04:56.980]  Ah!
[04:57.120 --> 04:57.760]  What's that truck doing?
[04:58.220 --> 04:58.960]  Don't get in his way.
[04:59.160 --> 04:59.520]  No, no, no.
[04:59.520 --> 04:59.900]  Out of nowhere.
[05:01.120 --> 05:02.500]  No, get in that one!
[05:06.900 --> 05:08.240]  All right, let's do this.
[05:08.860 --> 05:10.060]  Are we taking this other truck?
[05:10.180 --> 05:10.300]  Yeah.
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.300]  No, you're hopping on the back.
[05:12.000 --> 05:12.680]  Oh, are we?
[05:12.860 --> 05:13.280]  Okay, cool.
[05:13.440 --> 05:13.820]  I'm on the back.
[05:14.720 --> 05:15.240]  Oh, good.
[05:15.240 --> 05:18.440]  It's the reverse of the in-between the heists.
[05:18.800 --> 05:19.540]  Oh, no.
[05:20.300 --> 05:21.280]  Oh, no.
[05:21.320 --> 05:22.340]  Let's just drive backwards.
[05:22.820 --> 05:23.860]  Oh, no.
[05:24.200 --> 05:25.060]  Last time I was just here.
[05:25.220 --> 05:26.220]  Oh, no.
[05:27.700 --> 05:29.780]  We only have one life!
[05:32.260 --> 05:33.200]  What the fuck?
[05:33.600 --> 05:36.120]  What is happening?
[05:36.500 --> 05:37.120]  Andrew's driving.
[05:37.740 --> 05:39.160]  Is he shooting rockets?
[05:39.600 --> 05:40.220]  No, I shot that.
[05:41.280 --> 05:42.460]  Oh, my God.
[05:42.940 --> 05:46.480]  You know, Trash Trucks and Los Santos.
[05:46.720 --> 05:47.840]  They got that rocket ability.
[05:48.340 --> 05:49.480]  It's a rough place to live.
[05:49.580 --> 05:50.060]  Real rough.
[05:50.120 --> 05:51.420]  All right, let's get Ben in.
[05:53.740 --> 05:54.540]  Protect the trash.
[05:54.880 --> 05:55.660]  I like the collectors while they get trash.
[05:56.160 --> 05:56.680]  Protect the trash.
[05:57.080 --> 05:57.960]  Oh, I'm just...
[05:57.960 --> 05:58.620]  I don't want to.
[05:59.200 --> 06:00.640]  I just want to be a trash guy.
[06:03.360 --> 06:04.140]  Y'all okay?
[06:04.480 --> 06:04.700]  Yep.
[06:04.900 --> 06:05.500]  Just grabbing bags.
[06:05.500 --> 06:07.280]  Yeah, we're picking up the trash.
[06:08.240 --> 06:10.140]  Yeah, we're just really just picking up trash.
[06:10.720 --> 06:12.440]  Wow, look how keen we are.
[06:12.440 --> 06:14.160]  On this, we're just...
[06:14.160 --> 06:14.360]  We're like...
[06:14.360 --> 06:15.600]  We're like flying.
[06:15.880 --> 06:16.360]  All right!
[06:17.720 --> 06:19.000]  Why did it drop?
[06:19.100 --> 06:20.180]  The trash bag isn't...
[06:20.180 --> 06:22.160]  It said hit the button to throw it in the back.
[06:22.280 --> 06:22.880]  I hit the button.
[06:22.980 --> 06:23.840]  He dropped it on the ground.
[06:23.840 --> 06:26.040]  I can't pick it up because the trash bag's on mine.
[06:27.460 --> 06:27.860]  There.
[06:28.100 --> 06:28.920]  Move forward a little bit.
[06:29.160 --> 06:29.260]  Thanks.
[06:29.460 --> 06:29.840]  Yep, yep.
[06:31.640 --> 06:32.940]  What is my A.D.A.
[06:32.960 --> 06:33.420]  There we go.
[06:33.960 --> 06:34.220]  What are we...
[06:34.220 --> 06:34.840]  Pick it up.
[06:34.980 --> 06:35.400]  Yeah, there we go.
[06:35.820 --> 06:36.820]  Jesus Christ.
[06:36.900 --> 06:37.780]  What are we protecting you from?
[06:37.780 --> 06:38.540]  Morning traffic?
[06:39.760 --> 06:40.160]  Goddamn.
[06:40.500 --> 06:41.360]  Yeah, I don't know what that was.
[06:41.360 --> 06:42.260]  All right.
[06:43.820 --> 06:44.740]  Capital Boulevard!
[06:48.000 --> 06:49.940]  Because she loves something.
[06:50.460 --> 06:51.740]  Oh, you better pick left or right.
[06:51.880 --> 06:52.600]  Oh my God.
[06:53.600 --> 06:54.400]  Excuse us.
[06:55.060 --> 06:55.560]  Oh, we're good.
[06:56.940 --> 06:59.260]  Why are we driving into oncoming traffic?
[06:59.700 --> 07:00.540]  It shouldn't be in my way.
[07:01.140 --> 07:02.280]  We got trash to deliver.
[07:02.540 --> 07:02.640]  Yeah.
[07:03.200 --> 07:03.840]  Ball to pick up.
[07:04.120 --> 07:05.640]  We have trash to deliver.
[07:05.640 --> 07:06.980]  Yeah, we gotta deliver it to the city.
[07:07.480 --> 07:10.460]  What do you think the trash guy does?
[07:10.460 --> 07:13.220]  Do you think they just pick it up and deliver it to the landfill?
[07:13.580 --> 07:13.780]  Yeah.
[07:16.820 --> 07:18.440]  He brings the landfill trash.
[07:19.080 --> 07:20.060]  That's who employs the trash man.
[07:20.060 --> 07:23.100]  The way you look at it is that they're not picking up trash from you.
[07:23.340 --> 07:24.760]  It's that they're delivering trash.
[07:24.780 --> 07:26.460]  They're taking the trash to the landfill.
[07:26.620 --> 07:27.080]  They're delivering.
[07:27.640 --> 07:30.940]  Why don't you get your ass up here instead of making us rattle this way?
[07:31.820 --> 07:33.360]  Oh, the game made us park here.
[07:33.520 --> 07:34.120]  That's where the marker was.
[07:34.120 --> 07:34.700]  We got company.
[07:34.800 --> 07:35.640]  Yeah, but you can get close.
[07:37.480 --> 07:38.380]  Whoa, what the hell?
[07:39.820 --> 07:41.340]  Oh shit, I'll cover you guys.
[07:43.080 --> 07:43.400]  Yeah.
[07:43.500 --> 07:44.220]  You got it?
[07:44.260 --> 07:47.240]  Probably why we were out here because there's a bunch of fucking guys out here.
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.200]  You want to grab the other trash?
[07:48.300 --> 07:49.060]  I'll watch your back.
[07:49.660 --> 07:49.800]  All right.
[07:50.260 --> 07:51.040]  I'll watch you guys.
[07:51.220 --> 07:51.560]  You grab them.
[07:51.640 --> 07:52.140]  Can I throw it?
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.500]  Someone shot my butthole.
[07:55.260 --> 07:57.120]  Yeah, you gotta grab the trash here.
[07:57.920 --> 07:58.740]  All right, let's get out of here.
[07:58.860 --> 07:59.340]  Are they all dead?
[07:59.560 --> 08:01.500]  That's a little sneaky place to store the trash.
[08:01.660 --> 08:01.760]  Let's go.
[08:06.200 --> 08:06.840]  Nice throw.
[08:07.880 --> 08:08.600]  All right.
[08:12.040 --> 08:13.560]  Cause we're the trash men.
[08:15.400 --> 08:17.140]  Oh, we left a guy alive back there.
[08:19.100 --> 08:20.960]  Tell them the trash man send the regards.
[08:21.220 --> 08:21.700]  Oh, Gavin.
[08:22.120 --> 08:23.040]  Oh, you saw that, huh?
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.840]  Did I see you shooting off the back of the car right next to me?
[08:27.960 --> 08:28.560]  Yeah, I saw that.
[08:30.220 --> 08:31.960]  We got a beef with the cement people.
[08:32.520 --> 08:33.380]  Oh, look out, lady.
[08:33.580 --> 08:34.200]  Oh, nice job.
[08:35.480 --> 08:37.000]  Trash people don't like the cement people.
[08:37.900 --> 08:38.500]  Yeah, right.
[08:38.540 --> 08:39.540]  They're delivering the cement.
[08:39.740 --> 08:40.700]  They're natural born enemies.
[08:44.220 --> 08:44.680]  Oh, what the?
[08:45.380 --> 08:45.980]  Oh, who is?
[08:46.240 --> 08:47.340]  What is this car doing?
[08:47.480 --> 08:48.440]  Oh, no.
[08:49.560 --> 08:50.300]  Oh, boy.
[08:50.380 --> 08:50.740]  Hold on.
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.400]  Oh, brother.
[08:51.580 --> 08:52.000]  Excuse me.
[08:52.220 --> 08:52.960]  It's full of trashes this time.
[08:53.580 --> 08:53.880]  You gonna?
[08:54.060 --> 08:55.520]  Hey, are you gonna come cover us or what?
[08:55.520 --> 08:58.140]  Yeah, I took care of that guy who was driving alongside us.
[08:58.620 --> 08:59.220]  Thanks, man.
[08:59.320 --> 08:59.920]  Good coverage.
[09:00.220 --> 09:02.640]  I don't know that that's what we needed coverage from, but I appreciate it.
[09:02.780 --> 09:03.600]  Well, he seemed dangerous.
[09:03.600 --> 09:05.560]  He was driving erratically.
[09:06.180 --> 09:06.580]  Erratically?
[09:07.180 --> 09:07.580]  Wrong.
[09:07.940 --> 09:09.460]  He was driving sporadically?
[09:09.600 --> 09:10.500]  He was driving sometimes.
[09:11.180 --> 09:11.560]  Across the street.
[09:12.880 --> 09:13.280]  Everywhere.
[09:16.040 --> 09:17.140]  Oh, someone protect me.
[09:17.160 --> 09:17.700]  I'm getting shot.
[09:18.480 --> 09:19.300]  Working on it.
[09:19.460 --> 09:19.560]  Oh.
[09:22.860 --> 09:24.240]  Coming with another bag, Gavin.
[09:24.360 --> 09:25.480]  There's one more bag if you can grab it.
[09:27.900 --> 09:29.520]  Jesus, they got too much trash.
[09:30.160 --> 09:32.200]  This is not a regulation amount of trash.
[09:32.200 --> 09:34.460]  This is against the city rules.
[09:35.100 --> 09:36.700]  City ordinance say no.
[09:40.080 --> 09:40.880]  Andrew died.
[09:41.500 --> 09:42.180]  Why'd you die?
[09:42.800 --> 09:43.840]  Wait, how do we have lives?
[09:45.200 --> 09:46.060]  Because it's normal.
[09:46.240 --> 09:46.580]  One life.
[09:46.780 --> 09:46.940]  Normal.
[09:47.160 --> 09:48.260]  Wait, you put on normal?
[09:49.380 --> 09:50.920]  No, I didn't put it on hard.
[09:51.140 --> 09:52.080]  It starts on normal.
[09:52.380 --> 09:53.440]  Yeah, but we would do it on hard.
[09:54.200 --> 09:55.280]  Yeah, well, listen.
[09:56.640 --> 09:58.520]  Andrew, are you going to drive this fucking truck or not?
[09:58.540 --> 10:00.900]  No, I'm not going to because I'm in the middle of the street.
[10:00.900 --> 10:01.820]  I'm also dead.
[10:02.020 --> 10:02.520]  I'm not even near the truck.
[10:02.940 --> 10:03.520]  I'm also dead.
[10:05.200 --> 10:06.860]  Hey, Gavin, we did great.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.000]  Hey, you know what?
[10:08.040 --> 10:08.760]  Everyone did great.
[10:08.880 --> 10:11.140]  I was distracted by not being on hard mode.
[10:12.080 --> 10:13.660]  Yeah, why did you put on the wrong difficulty?
[10:14.420 --> 10:14.940]  No, I didn't.
[10:15.040 --> 10:15.860]  It was on the right.
[10:16.040 --> 10:17.080]  Well, it was on the wrong.
[10:17.800 --> 10:18.340]  Uh, listen.
[10:18.560 --> 10:18.860]  What?
[10:18.960 --> 10:19.680]  What is he?
[10:19.960 --> 10:20.780]  It's the morning.
[10:21.620 --> 10:21.720]  What?
[10:21.900 --> 10:24.140]  Eric, I'm not criticizing him today.
[10:24.220 --> 10:25.140]  Can you take care of it?
[10:30.620 --> 10:32.080]  I don't think we have to.
[10:32.080 --> 10:33.120]  We just let him talk.
[10:33.280 --> 10:34.360]  And now here we are.
[10:35.160 --> 10:36.000]  It's on the right.
[10:36.140 --> 10:36.440]  The wrong.
[10:36.740 --> 10:38.860]  I just really wanted to make sure the trash got delivered.
[10:39.080 --> 10:41.960]  I wanted to give us the most amount of time to deliver that trash.
[10:42.720 --> 10:44.700]  You have to set like one option in this.
[10:44.760 --> 10:47.000]  You have to pick the thing and change one option.
[10:47.880 --> 10:48.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:49.520 --> 10:50.140]  That's correct.
[10:50.280 --> 10:50.460]  Yeah.
[10:51.720 --> 10:52.080]  Restart.
[10:52.540 --> 10:52.940]  Right. Okay.
[10:52.980 --> 10:54.320]  Oh, so we are all on the same page.
[10:54.360 --> 10:54.740]  That's great.
[10:55.220 --> 10:55.660]  You know what?
[10:55.880 --> 10:59.460]  I don't even feel bad that I put a sticky bomb on the gas station and blew it up.
[11:00.120 --> 11:00.880]  Wait a minute.
[11:03.820 --> 11:04.600]  You want to get it?
[11:06.160 --> 11:06.940]  I'm out of here.
[11:11.940 --> 11:13.240]  How are we doing, boys?
[11:14.360 --> 11:15.360]  I'm doing great.
[11:22.800 --> 11:23.600]  Oh, man.
[11:23.680 --> 11:24.280]  All the way at the beginning.
[11:24.620 --> 11:25.280]  Oh, shit.
[11:25.320 --> 11:25.700]  I forgot.
[11:27.180 --> 11:28.540]  We got to kill these guys.
[11:33.750 --> 11:33.950]  Okay.
[11:33.950 --> 11:37.310]  So maybe next round, trash guys can grab the trash a bit faster.
[11:38.710 --> 11:41.510]  Oh, you think the issue was the trash guys?
[11:41.650 --> 11:42.530]  Why don't you just park on it?
[11:42.690 --> 11:43.270]  Park next to it.
[11:43.330 --> 11:44.150]  Well, I don't know where it is.
[11:44.350 --> 11:44.650]  It's...
[11:44.650 --> 11:46.390]  I don't have any marker for where the trash is.
[11:46.410 --> 11:46.850]  Here, you drive.
[11:47.030 --> 11:47.950]  I don't...
[11:47.950 --> 11:48.150]  Okay.
[11:49.630 --> 11:50.430]  The issue...
[11:50.430 --> 11:54.250]  He thinks that the issue was that we didn't grab the trash fast enough.
[11:54.690 --> 11:56.690]  Well, I mean, you could use two hands.
[11:56.850 --> 11:58.390]  You're only picking up one bag at a time.
[12:01.530 --> 12:03.610]  We're just picking up a series of trash bags.
[12:04.170 --> 12:04.490]  Yeah.
[12:04.630 --> 12:05.970]  It's just a series of trash.
[12:08.490 --> 12:09.470]  But we got to fund it.
[12:11.650 --> 12:12.870]  That's why we have all the cocaine.
[12:14.910 --> 12:16.570]  I don't know what the trash is getting us here.
[12:17.030 --> 12:19.870]  Do you think we only want the bags for the trash?
[12:20.010 --> 12:20.910]  Like, that's why we're doing this?
[12:20.970 --> 12:21.550]  We need bags?
[12:21.570 --> 12:22.670]  Yeah, we like the bags, yeah.
[12:22.930 --> 12:23.050]  Oh.
[12:24.330 --> 12:25.490]  I guess it's over here.
[12:25.850 --> 12:26.210]  We're all the way over here.
[12:26.210 --> 12:27.830]  Nobody's going to come for this one.
[12:27.830 --> 12:29.390]  Yeah, just back it up down there.
[12:29.690 --> 12:31.110]  I'm backing it up.
[12:31.110 --> 12:32.530]  Move on to the next one.
[12:32.770 --> 12:34.170]  I don't trust him, but that's just me.
[12:35.790 --> 12:36.630]  He's got it.
[12:36.810 --> 12:37.230]  Oh, God.
[12:37.450 --> 12:38.790]  Okay, he's got it.
[12:38.910 --> 12:39.890]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[12:39.890 --> 12:40.650]  He's got it.
[12:41.330 --> 12:42.610]  Okay, Gavin.
[12:43.550 --> 12:44.490]  All right, let's go.
[12:44.930 --> 12:45.530]  Next book.
[12:46.190 --> 12:49.750]  All right, so the next one, Andrew, they have us drop outside the alley.
[12:50.010 --> 12:52.490]  And then if we want, we can go down the alley.
[12:52.990 --> 12:53.110]  Yeah.
[12:56.830 --> 12:58.450]  I got the next ones laid out.
[12:58.530 --> 13:00.330]  The problem is when I've never been there.
[13:00.330 --> 13:01.410]  I don't know where the track is.
[13:02.310 --> 13:03.290]  I don't get the marker.
[13:03.670 --> 13:08.210]  Gavin, were you pretty happy when you said that you put the sticky ball on the gas station
[13:08.210 --> 13:09.310]  that nobody called you on it?
[13:09.430 --> 13:10.330]  Or was that...
[13:10.330 --> 13:11.390]  What do you mean nobody called me on it?
[13:12.110 --> 13:13.490]  Nobody said anything about you.
[13:13.490 --> 13:17.350]  Well, to be fair, we were on easy, normal mode.
[13:19.410 --> 13:20.270]  Oh, yeah, it's easy.
[13:20.610 --> 13:21.570]  Yeah, so it's easy peasy.
[13:24.870 --> 13:26.290]  All right, I'm going to step out.
[13:26.610 --> 13:27.770]  Oh, what the...
[13:30.430 --> 13:31.190]  That was awesome.
[13:31.210 --> 13:31.850]  There you go.
[13:33.490 --> 13:34.370]  Look how quick that was.
[13:34.450 --> 13:34.810]  Where's the last trash bag?
[13:35.090 --> 13:36.530]  Oh, you got it, you got it, you got it.
[13:37.550 --> 13:38.630]  We're speed running this.
[13:38.790 --> 13:40.030]  Hey, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[13:40.030 --> 13:41.010]  We're on it, we're getting shot.
[13:41.470 --> 13:41.810]  Let's go.
[13:43.730 --> 13:45.210]  We're driving a little prick's van.
[13:46.310 --> 13:47.530]  Hey, you little asshat.
[13:50.230 --> 13:51.450]  Please, leave them all over here, huh?
[13:53.150 --> 13:54.110]  Wait, who's over there?
[13:54.270 --> 13:54.990]  Who hasn't gotten on?
[13:55.570 --> 13:56.990]  I'm back here shooting things.
[13:57.110 --> 13:57.990]  What are you doing?
[13:58.270 --> 13:59.370]  I was covering you.
[13:59.530 --> 13:59.910]  Let's go.
[14:01.070 --> 14:02.150]  Just get in.
[14:02.450 --> 14:02.850]  I'm in.
[14:03.110 --> 14:04.270]  I had no idea you went on.
[14:04.890 --> 14:05.390]  Nuh-uh.
[14:05.610 --> 14:07.250]  All of a sudden, it just kept saying like,
[14:07.490 --> 14:08.670]  oh, make sure everyone's here.
[14:08.810 --> 14:10.250]  And it's like, who isn't here?
[14:10.350 --> 14:10.770]  I was covering us.
[14:10.770 --> 14:13.210]  It was Nick Baffled by the blue dot on the map.
[14:13.550 --> 14:14.770]  Yeah, I thought we all...
[14:14.770 --> 14:16.630]  I thought we had a really strong plan there, Andrew.
[14:16.690 --> 14:17.630]  I thought you did a great job.
[14:18.010 --> 14:18.570]  I... listen.
[14:18.730 --> 14:20.370]  So this time, pull into the gas station.
[14:20.430 --> 14:21.350]  It's going to be to your right.
[14:21.510 --> 14:22.670]  You just pull into the gas station.
[14:23.190 --> 14:23.450]  I will.
[14:25.890 --> 14:28.550]  So I'm going to get out to cover us this time.
[14:28.550 --> 14:29.370]  Uh-huh.
[14:29.570 --> 14:31.250]  How far away from the truck are you going to run?
[14:31.650 --> 14:32.350]  Not very.
[14:33.370 --> 14:34.270]  Okay, that's good.
[14:36.750 --> 14:41.590]  You know, we had an exit route because I distracted two cars.
[14:43.650 --> 14:44.090]  Cool.
[14:44.250 --> 14:44.710]  I was helping.
[14:45.010 --> 14:45.870]  Way to go, buddy.
[14:51.560 --> 14:52.440]  Where's the bag?
[14:52.640 --> 14:53.520]  Where are the bags?
[14:53.640 --> 14:54.880]  Trash truck must level.
[14:55.180 --> 14:56.040]  Andrew, you have to level off.
[14:56.620 --> 14:57.140]  Uh-oh.
[14:57.440 --> 14:58.660]  Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[14:58.900 --> 14:59.120]  Okay.
[14:59.340 --> 14:59.880]  Oh, shit.
[15:00.280 --> 15:00.720]  Incoming.
[15:04.160 --> 15:04.720]  Ah, bollocks.
[15:04.820 --> 15:05.120]  Dead now.
[15:05.260 --> 15:05.920]  Oh, shit.
[15:06.000 --> 15:06.280]  Holy shit.
[15:06.700 --> 15:07.560]  It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[15:08.900 --> 15:10.200]  Rear of the trash truck is blocked.
[15:11.000 --> 15:11.340]  There you go.
[15:11.540 --> 15:12.180]  Now you should be good.
[15:12.460 --> 15:13.060]  I was just in the way.
[15:14.300 --> 15:15.320]  Oh, we got company coming.
[15:15.860 --> 15:16.620]  Yep, down the street.
[15:16.840 --> 15:16.940]  Okay.
[15:16.980 --> 15:17.840]  Down the alley, I think.
[15:20.800 --> 15:21.080]  Nice.
[15:21.480 --> 15:22.260]  Okay, let's get out of here.
[15:22.860 --> 15:23.760]  Where's the last trash bag?
[15:23.860 --> 15:24.080]  Here it is.
[15:24.220 --> 15:24.600]  Oh, you don't have it.
[15:24.740 --> 15:26.180]  Oh, God, there's a lot of cars.
[15:26.680 --> 15:27.640]  There's so many.
[15:29.200 --> 15:29.820]  Andrew, get in.
[15:31.300 --> 15:31.860]  Jesus Christ.
[15:32.480 --> 15:33.700]  Yeah, I'm getting in.
[15:33.800 --> 15:34.020]  I'm in.
[15:34.180 --> 15:34.340]  I'm in.
[15:34.640 --> 15:34.820]  All right.
[15:35.080 --> 15:36.460]  Uh, go, go, go.
[15:37.500 --> 15:38.500]  We need to get out of here.
[15:39.360 --> 15:39.940]  Gavin's dead.
[15:43.040 --> 15:44.880]  We can't put the trash truck there.
[15:46.140 --> 15:46.320]  Yeah.
[15:48.800 --> 15:50.080]  That was a bad plan.
[15:53.780 --> 15:54.520]  I agree.
[15:57.240 --> 15:58.420]  That was your plan.
[15:58.840 --> 16:00.060]  It was Gavin's plan.
[16:01.180 --> 16:01.740]  My plan?
[16:03.140 --> 16:06.960]  You're, you're the one going, ah, get the truck over here.
[16:07.160 --> 16:08.460]  My plan was to play on hot.
[16:09.180 --> 16:09.760]  Oh, yeah.
[16:10.720 --> 16:12.880]  Oh, you should have said that plan before we started.
[16:13.260 --> 16:13.340]  Oh.
[16:13.660 --> 16:14.980]  What? No, that's always the plan.
[16:15.720 --> 16:16.360]  No, it is the plan.
[16:16.440 --> 16:16.920]  Yeah, you're right.
[16:17.020 --> 16:17.680]  I just, I forgot.
[16:20.340 --> 16:23.080]  I feel bad when you don't fight back.
[16:23.340 --> 16:23.860]  Yeah, I know.
[16:24.120 --> 16:26.220]  Yeah, when it's, when it's just a simple like...
[16:26.220 --> 16:26.720]  Yeah, you're right.
[16:26.880 --> 16:27.560]  No, that was wrong.
[16:27.880 --> 16:31.880]  I noticed it about two minutes before you guys did, and I went, well, fuck.
[16:32.780 --> 16:34.300]  I can, I can get on the back.
[16:34.400 --> 16:36.400]  Oh, you just pulled me off for shits and giggles last time.
[16:36.620 --> 16:37.980]  No, I didn't know I was doing that.
[16:39.440 --> 16:41.280]  I tapped the button the same way I did this time.
[16:42.060 --> 16:42.820]  This thing is slow.
[16:42.820 --> 16:43.600]  Doesn't seem worth it.
[16:43.940 --> 16:44.440]  Oh, no.
[16:44.740 --> 16:46.040]  Oh, it sped up a little bit then.
[16:47.020 --> 16:47.280]  Yep.
[16:58.780 --> 17:01.720]  Oh, I'm doing, I'm doing it Red Dead style where I'm just,
[17:01.800 --> 17:04.920]  I'm locking on and then tapping a little bit on the stick and it's headshots.
[17:05.040 --> 17:07.520]  I, I totally forgot about that.
[17:14.020 --> 17:14.560]  I'm on the back.
[17:14.660 --> 17:15.080]  I'm on the back.
[17:15.460 --> 17:16.120]  Getting in the front.
[17:17.440 --> 17:19.860]  We had to kill everybody, right, to unlock the truck?
[17:20.260 --> 17:21.460]  Uh, I'm going with that, yeah.
[17:22.400 --> 17:28.060]  I was about to say, if we didn't, the extent that Nick went to kill that guy made me laugh.
[17:28.920 --> 17:29.660]  Yeah, listen, no...
[17:29.660 --> 17:30.780]  Oh, he wanted to make sure he was dead.
[17:30.940 --> 17:31.560]  Yeah, absolutely.
[17:33.220 --> 17:34.640]  How many of these are we doing today, a couple?
[17:36.380 --> 17:38.000]  It depends on how long it takes.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.280]  Yeah, as many as, hey, as, as many as you want.
[17:40.600 --> 17:41.300]  Like three?
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.560]  Do you think that this series of funding alone is going to be a video per setup?
[17:49.900 --> 17:50.500]  Oh, big time.
[17:51.300 --> 17:52.940]  It's looking that way, currently.
[17:53.440 --> 17:55.880]  Yeah, I mean the, the amount of times we have to restart it, yeah.
[17:57.640 --> 18:00.780]  That's, uh, it's, and it's one to Nick, one to me so far for restarts.
[18:01.280 --> 18:01.780]  It is?
[18:02.620 --> 18:03.980]  But at least we're playing on normal.
[18:04.340 --> 18:04.800]  Is it not?
[18:05.300 --> 18:06.660]  No, Andrew died the first time.
[18:07.060 --> 18:07.260]  Oh.
[18:08.360 --> 18:09.560]  Well, in the explosion.
[18:09.980 --> 18:11.400]  All right, let's go, boys.
[18:11.560 --> 18:11.960]  And then Gavin.
[18:12.100 --> 18:12.820]  One to Andrew, one to me.
[18:14.120 --> 18:18.380]  If a person walks into a building and someone else blows up that building,
[18:18.680 --> 18:19.960]  it's not ruled a suicide.
[18:20.680 --> 18:22.560]  That was, somebody killed me.
[18:22.760 --> 18:28.640]  I mean, okay, now I was gonna say, come on, Andrew, but I think that you made a very strong case.
[18:29.040 --> 18:30.400]  Yeah, you made a great argument.
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.080]  You made a great argument.
[18:33.140 --> 18:36.520]  Yeah, that, I mean, you really, very good, very, very good.
[18:36.600 --> 18:36.740]  Yeah.
[18:38.740 --> 18:41.300]  All right, let's go here and then I'll reverse.
[18:41.460 --> 18:42.740]  All right, we're cutting our way down.
[18:46.680 --> 18:47.340]  Oh, perfect.
[18:47.560 --> 18:49.700]  We all be facing, we'll be facing forward so we can just.
[18:51.360 --> 18:52.260]  Oh, who's this?
[18:52.380 --> 18:53.360]  Oh, no, that lady.
[18:54.980 --> 18:55.980]  Just look behind.
[18:56.120 --> 18:56.840]  We had a bonus.
[19:02.860 --> 19:04.100]  That's the real one.
[19:04.280 --> 19:04.560]  What do you mean?
[19:04.640 --> 19:05.320]  It's get the last bag.
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.380]  Oh, it was amongst a bunch of others.
[19:07.380 --> 19:08.820]  We're about to get back.
[19:09.320 --> 19:10.700]  Come on, just get on.
[19:10.800 --> 19:10.960]  Let's go.
[19:11.100 --> 19:12.100]  We're gonna drive through.
[19:12.360 --> 19:13.400]  Oh, God, let's do it.
[19:13.560 --> 19:14.260]  Here we go.
[19:15.380 --> 19:16.260]  Oh, shit.
[19:17.680 --> 19:20.280]  Oh, oh, oh, we're taking hits.
[19:21.880 --> 19:23.300]  I didn't get shot once.
[19:23.420 --> 19:24.240]  I lost all my armor.
[19:25.880 --> 19:27.780]  Put on some new armor.
[19:28.560 --> 19:28.980]  Yeah, I did.
[19:34.060 --> 19:36.240]  Okay, the pesky gas station.
[19:36.240 --> 19:39.220]  Oh, you can munch like a moth when you're on the back of a vehicle.
[19:39.360 --> 19:39.940]  Holy shit.
[19:40.140 --> 19:41.040]  I just scoffed.
[19:43.340 --> 19:43.660]  Munched?
[19:43.740 --> 19:44.840]  You don't typically scoff.
[19:45.200 --> 19:46.640]  Stuffed my fat little face.
[19:49.100 --> 19:49.740]  All right.
[19:49.800 --> 19:51.700]  So how do we want to play a cookie through the tape?
[19:52.220 --> 19:53.520]  I think you guys just need to cover us.
[19:53.580 --> 19:54.980]  And we got in like Nick cover us.
[19:55.060 --> 19:55.820]  We'll try to be fast.
[19:55.940 --> 19:56.700]  Okay, that's all we can do.
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.120]  Well, work from the back forward and see if we can just make it happen faster.
[20:00.560 --> 20:03.820]  I'm going to park in the gas station, but in a little bit better.
[20:04.540 --> 20:05.360]  Oh, that's a pretty good spot.
[20:05.360 --> 20:06.500]  Just make sure you're level and we're good.
[20:06.660 --> 20:06.900]  All right.
[20:06.960 --> 20:07.500]  I got one bag.
[20:07.580 --> 20:08.420]  Got guys in the alley.
[20:09.120 --> 20:10.240]  Yeah, going to the alley.
[20:10.940 --> 20:11.720]  I'll watch the street.
[20:12.960 --> 20:14.040]  All right, I'm on my second bag.
[20:14.100 --> 20:14.600]  Let's get out of it.
[20:16.140 --> 20:16.540]  Oh, shit.
[20:16.660 --> 20:17.180]  Got those guys.
[20:17.240 --> 20:17.800]  Oh, I dropped it.
[20:17.820 --> 20:18.520]  I just put it on the floor.
[20:19.440 --> 20:21.120]  Yeah, you parked on my trash.
[20:21.340 --> 20:22.140]  You parked on the trash.
[20:22.360 --> 20:23.280]  Move forward a little bit, Andrew.
[20:23.440 --> 20:24.760]  I'm not in the car.
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.340]  I'm trying to defend.
[20:27.540 --> 20:29.620]  I didn't park on the trash.
[20:29.960 --> 20:32.680]  I was parked and you threw your trash under my car.
[20:32.700 --> 20:33.260]  Nick, come back.
[20:33.840 --> 20:34.400]  One sec.
[20:35.360 --> 20:35.580]  OK.
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.400]  Let's go.
[20:38.960 --> 20:39.900]  OK, let's go, boys.
[20:40.020 --> 20:40.840]  Where are you guys?
[20:40.960 --> 20:41.120]  OK.
[20:41.700 --> 20:42.540]  What do you mean?
[20:42.820 --> 20:44.940]  I meant, where is the truck in relation to where I'm defending?
[20:46.760 --> 20:47.200]  What?
[20:47.440 --> 20:48.140]  What question?
[20:48.540 --> 20:49.200]  It's fine.
[20:49.420 --> 20:50.440]  We just got to go.
[20:50.500 --> 20:51.180]  It's fine.
[20:51.600 --> 20:52.640]  Dude, what is right?
[20:53.100 --> 20:53.420]  What are you?
[20:53.520 --> 20:53.660]  What?
[20:54.440 --> 20:56.500]  We got to deliver this trash.
[20:57.400 --> 20:59.040]  How was I wrong in my question?
[20:59.160 --> 21:00.640]  Where's the truck in relation to where I'm standing?
[21:00.940 --> 21:02.480]  Where are you?
[21:02.620 --> 21:04.060]  We don't know where you are.
[21:04.500 --> 21:04.940]  Right.
[21:04.940 --> 21:05.680]  Where's the truck?
[21:05.720 --> 21:06.760]  What do you mean?
[21:07.160 --> 21:08.420]  Where's the fucking truck?
[21:08.560 --> 21:08.940]  What's the?
[21:11.540 --> 21:14.200]  How is that not a good question in that instance?
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.820]  Well, you got out of it, didn't you?
[21:16.240 --> 21:16.480]  Yeah.
[21:17.480 --> 21:18.640]  Parked it somewhere else.
[21:18.740 --> 21:19.960]  I stepped out while it was moving.
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.020]  Yeah, he parked it on my bag.
[21:23.120 --> 21:23.800]  Nick, good question.
[21:24.360 --> 21:25.100]  They didn't do it.
[21:25.280 --> 21:26.480]  No bad ideas.
[21:27.380 --> 21:27.520]  Yeah.
[21:27.720 --> 21:27.900]  Yeah.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.340]  No bad questions either.
[21:29.600 --> 21:30.080]  Oh, shit.
[21:30.120 --> 21:31.380]  We're all the way over here now.
[21:31.700 --> 21:32.920]  There's no stupid questions.
[21:32.920 --> 21:35.760]  Andrew, you might want to come around this way, but I'm not.
[21:36.000 --> 21:36.780]  Only stupid people.
[21:39.560 --> 21:40.340]  I'm going for the back one.
[21:42.080 --> 21:43.360]  Okay, I got this front one.
[21:45.420 --> 21:46.700]  I'm coming around the corner, Andrew.
[21:47.020 --> 21:47.300]  Hold it.
[21:49.060 --> 21:49.640]  Oh, shit.
[21:49.980 --> 21:51.240]  I'm gonna get in the alley and cover you guys.
[21:51.240 --> 21:51.640]  One more.
[21:52.200 --> 21:53.320]  There's one more bag.
[21:54.100 --> 21:56.300]  Gavin, if you want to grab it, I can do it, man.
[21:56.540 --> 21:56.860]  I'm covering.
[21:57.040 --> 21:57.480]  If you want to move.
[21:58.260 --> 22:00.460]  Nick, if you want to move.
[22:02.140 --> 22:03.540]  All right, let's get out of here.
[22:03.580 --> 22:03.720]  Got it.
[22:04.100 --> 22:05.460]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[22:06.160 --> 22:07.000]  Damn it.
[22:08.100 --> 22:10.100]  Fucking throw the bag in.
[22:11.840 --> 22:13.600]  Get the bag in the vehicle.
[22:14.480 --> 22:15.920]  All right, floor it, floor it, floor it.
[22:15.920 --> 22:16.480]  Okay, let's go.
[22:17.340 --> 22:17.720]  Let's go.
[22:18.960 --> 22:19.600]  Floor it.
[22:19.640 --> 22:21.020]  I'm in a fucking trash truck.
[22:21.920 --> 22:22.840]  Hey, look at that.
[22:23.300 --> 22:24.540]  Delivered to the warehouse.
[22:25.080 --> 22:26.340]  We're delivering the trash.
[22:26.680 --> 22:26.780]  Way to go.
[22:27.660 --> 22:29.360]  We're delivering the trash, boys.
[22:31.240 --> 22:32.200]  Side swipe.
[22:32.620 --> 22:33.940]  Oh, my God.
[22:37.320 --> 22:38.160]  Yeah, no shit.
[22:38.200 --> 22:39.080]  They're coming after us.
[22:39.400 --> 22:40.480]  Sweet Jesus.
[22:42.220 --> 22:42.940]  Oh, shit.
[22:43.720 --> 22:44.100]  Oh, shit.
[22:44.160 --> 22:44.500]  In front.
[22:45.340 --> 22:46.360]  Wow, they're coming around.
[22:46.600 --> 22:46.740]  Damn.
[22:47.040 --> 22:47.620]  Oh, here we go.
[22:48.280 --> 22:49.300]  To the side again.
[22:52.400 --> 22:53.340]  You guys okay?
[22:55.280 --> 22:56.080]  Uh, medium.
[22:57.040 --> 22:57.420]  Extra.
[22:58.720 --> 22:59.620]  Oh, my God.
[23:00.140 --> 23:01.720]  Oh, this is not good.
[23:01.740 --> 23:02.360]  It's okay, it's okay.
[23:02.360 --> 23:03.380]  Oh, no.
[23:03.880 --> 23:04.440]  Oh, okay.
[23:04.500 --> 23:04.940]  Gavin died.
[23:05.120 --> 23:05.900]  Oh, shit.
[23:06.020 --> 23:06.660]  Got to wait for them.
[23:06.880 --> 23:07.500]  We're going to spawn.
[23:07.980 --> 23:08.440]  Oh, this is...
[23:08.440 --> 23:09.120]  You're going to kill me.
[23:09.340 --> 23:10.220]  You're going to fucking kill...
[23:10.220 --> 23:11.900]  Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[23:11.980 --> 23:13.120]  Just keep going, just keep going.
[23:14.300 --> 23:15.400]  Why did you get off?
[23:15.520 --> 23:16.220]  What are you talking?
[23:16.260 --> 23:17.380]  I was going to die.
[23:17.780 --> 23:20.460]  The only reason we're still in the mission is because I got off.
[23:22.720 --> 23:25.120]  Stop fighting, stop fighting, stop fighting.
[23:26.100 --> 23:26.640]  Andrew's dead.
[23:28.620 --> 23:29.000]  Like...
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.440]  I didn't know where he was going to spawn.
[23:32.520 --> 23:33.740]  I didn't know where he was going to be.
[23:36.020 --> 23:40.000]  Well, they really grouped and consolidated and figured stuff out.
[23:41.340 --> 23:44.300]  I will say I was very covered when they were in that position.
[23:46.420 --> 23:47.400]  I was doing fine.
[23:47.480 --> 23:49.740]  They're shooting the back of the truck, which is not where I was.
[23:51.420 --> 23:52.920]  Who asked if one of these...
[23:52.920 --> 23:54.240]  Each set up is going to be its own video?
[23:54.740 --> 23:55.100]  I did.
[23:56.560 --> 23:56.920]  You...
[23:57.420 --> 23:58.240]  So what do you think?
[23:59.940 --> 24:00.300]  Yes.
[24:01.860 --> 24:02.420]  Thanks, man.
[24:02.980 --> 24:03.540]  Way to go, Gavin.
[24:10.850 --> 24:12.250]  My cut is 23 grand.
[24:12.330 --> 24:13.730]  I've certainly spent more than that on ammo.
[24:20.020 --> 24:21.220]  All the way to the beginning.
[24:21.300 --> 24:21.360]  Oh.
[24:22.340 --> 24:22.840]  Go for it.
[24:27.120 --> 24:29.720]  And so on the back of the truck, make sure you do some munching.
[24:30.320 --> 24:32.780]  Yeah, I'm going to munch between visits every time.
[24:34.740 --> 24:35.480]  Some munching.
[24:38.780 --> 24:39.660]  Thanks for the lift.
[24:42.960 --> 24:43.840]  Hold on.
[24:45.360 --> 24:46.120]  Oh, did he die?
[24:49.800 --> 24:50.680]  I got him.
[24:50.920 --> 24:52.980]  No, there is no prompt to kill that guy.
[24:53.100 --> 24:54.100]  We just get in the truck.
[24:54.220 --> 24:55.540]  Okay, we'll get in the truck this time then.
[24:56.000 --> 24:56.280]  Fine.
[24:56.460 --> 24:57.060]  One witness.
[24:57.820 --> 24:58.500]  Tell your friends.
[25:01.080 --> 25:02.540]  Well, good job.
[25:03.120 --> 25:04.080]  Yeah, he came after us.
[25:04.080 --> 25:04.940]  That's on him.
[25:06.480 --> 25:09.520]  This leaf blower that's turned on next to me is pretty awesome.
[25:09.800 --> 25:10.520]  Love that.
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.480]  Oh my God.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.540]  I got told by Big Trash that those were breakable now.
[25:19.620 --> 25:20.320]  That was not on me.
[25:22.780 --> 25:23.580]  Recent email.
[25:24.520 --> 25:25.900]  Well, that thing went flying.
[25:26.160 --> 25:27.040]  That hit a bike.
[25:28.240 --> 25:29.240]  I hit a bike?
[25:29.540 --> 25:30.700]  No, the sign did.
[25:31.220 --> 25:31.620]  Oh.
[25:31.980 --> 25:36.380]  Gavin dives a half a second too early and just falls flat.
[25:36.680 --> 25:37.720]  It's so funny.
[25:37.840 --> 25:39.940]  But when I get the timing right, it's really satisfying.
[25:40.120 --> 25:40.760]  It's pretty...
[25:40.760 --> 25:41.880]  I'll be honest, it's pretty cool.
[25:41.980 --> 25:42.660]  I like it.
[25:43.000 --> 25:43.860]  All right, that's good, that's good.
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.520]  What's really screwing me on this one is the same button to drop it as throw it and sometimes...
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.180]  Yes, it should...
[25:54.180 --> 25:56.400]  You breathe on it and it changes the prompt.
[25:57.400 --> 26:01.800]  The problem is that it changes from that like...
[26:01.800 --> 26:02.460]  Oh yeah, toss it in.
[26:02.500 --> 26:03.140]  No, just drop it.
[26:03.140 --> 26:05.320]  You fucked up and then your trash gets stuck?
[26:05.580 --> 26:06.180]  Yeah, it rolls.
[26:06.740 --> 26:07.620]  Pretty cool.
[26:12.170 --> 26:15.090]  I hate leaf blowers so much.
[26:18.730 --> 26:19.170]  Gavin!
[26:20.270 --> 26:21.990]  Yeah, he does that every time.
[26:22.670 --> 26:25.550]  I think I'm seeing why your health might be low sometimes.
[26:25.950 --> 26:27.530]  It's actually not hurting me too much.
[26:27.950 --> 26:28.250]  Oh, okay.
[26:32.720 --> 26:33.840]  Dude, what the fuck?
[26:33.880 --> 26:34.760]  It happened again.
[26:35.660 --> 26:36.900]  Oh damn, I did it too.
[26:38.220 --> 26:40.180]  Where did... what does it want from me?
[26:40.380 --> 26:40.780]  People coming!
[26:40.800 --> 26:41.940]  Oh, they're coming from behind you!
[26:45.560 --> 26:47.880]  Oh, oh, uh...
[26:47.880 --> 26:48.720]  I'm on, let's go.
[26:51.380 --> 26:52.060]  Scuffing armor.
[26:59.380 --> 27:00.320]  That was unfortunate.
[27:00.420 --> 27:03.320]  Holy shit, you just cost me like three light armors there.
[27:04.080 --> 27:04.960]  Oh my god.
[27:04.960 --> 27:05.760]  Yeah, that was really bad.
[27:09.160 --> 27:09.620]  Well, so...
[27:09.620 --> 27:10.280]  I bet they were delicious.
[27:10.280 --> 27:13.880]  I can't believe they put five different sizes of armor in this game.
[27:13.960 --> 27:14.900]  Just put armor.
[27:15.360 --> 27:15.620]  Yeah.
[27:16.240 --> 27:17.220]  Instead, it's like...
[27:17.840 --> 27:19.780]  All you want is full armor.
[27:19.880 --> 27:22.700]  And I have to press light armor like four times.
[27:22.820 --> 27:25.720]  Does that mean I'm putting on four vests on top of each other?
[27:27.420 --> 27:29.600]  Yeah, four weaker vests.
[27:32.040 --> 27:32.520]  God!
[27:36.100 --> 27:37.460]  Who says we got another guy?
[27:37.700 --> 27:38.180]  Oh, it's Nick.
[27:38.580 --> 27:39.040]  It's me!
[27:40.280 --> 27:41.920]  We got another guy.
[27:42.300 --> 27:43.100]  Where'd that guy come from?
[27:43.120 --> 27:43.600]  Hey, Gavin?
[27:43.720 --> 27:43.860]  Yeah?
[27:44.080 --> 27:44.660]  News to you.
[27:44.840 --> 27:46.300]  You got another guy as well.
[27:46.800 --> 27:47.660]  There's four of us.
[27:50.340 --> 27:52.000]  Can everyone grab trash or just us?
[27:52.420 --> 27:53.100]  Just you guys.
[27:55.740 --> 27:56.440]  Yeah, I don't think...
[27:56.440 --> 27:57.080]  I don't think they have...
[27:57.080 --> 27:58.720]  Let me know when you guys are on like the last one.
[27:58.740 --> 27:59.020]  I'm on.
[28:00.160 --> 28:00.640]  I'm on.
[28:00.720 --> 28:00.900]  Let's go.
[28:00.980 --> 28:01.820]  I'm on the last bag here.
[28:01.920 --> 28:02.620]  Last bag here.
[28:02.820 --> 28:03.560]  Nick, you coming back?
[28:04.340 --> 28:06.120]  I feel like I saw a rocket go by.
[28:06.220 --> 28:06.560]  We're clear.
[28:07.180 --> 28:07.500]  And...
[28:07.500 --> 28:08.440]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[28:08.520 --> 28:08.740]  We're on.
[28:08.820 --> 28:09.720]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[28:10.420 --> 28:11.280]  Good work.
[28:11.300 --> 28:12.580]  Wow, look at us.
[28:13.240 --> 28:13.900]  Uh-oh.
[28:17.740 --> 28:18.460]  We're fine.
[28:18.720 --> 28:19.380]  Guys in front.
[28:19.880 --> 28:20.040]  There you go.
[28:20.040 --> 28:20.780]  Great work.
[28:20.900 --> 28:21.580]  That was awesome.
[28:24.020 --> 28:25.260]  There we go.
[28:25.660 --> 28:26.180]  Well...
[28:26.180 --> 28:27.180]  Oh, that guy...
[28:27.180 --> 28:28.600]  That guy's having a bad day.
[28:28.640 --> 28:29.080]  Oh, I'm hurt.
[28:30.240 --> 28:31.720]  Have a bad day.
[28:43.960 --> 28:45.920]  I think I just worked back to high school.
[28:48.460 --> 28:49.640]  I'm trying to get off.
[28:49.820 --> 28:50.060]  I was...
[28:50.060 --> 28:50.800]  Get off like I do.
[28:51.260 --> 28:52.240]  Just a little bit early.
[28:53.040 --> 28:53.400]  No.
[28:55.340 --> 28:56.280]  Oh, yeah, every time.
[28:57.640 --> 28:57.940]  Yes.
[28:58.160 --> 28:59.600]  Stop talking about getting off.
[29:01.180 --> 29:02.680]  Please let me pick up the trash bag, please.
[29:02.840 --> 29:03.880]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[29:04.320 --> 29:04.600]  Uh-oh.
[29:04.720 --> 29:05.920]  Wow, I threw that with aggression.
[29:07.240 --> 29:07.840]  Oh, yeah.
[29:07.980 --> 29:10.600]  Gavin, I gave you shit at the start about moving the truck to you.
[29:10.740 --> 29:11.220]  It was a great idea.
[29:11.620 --> 29:12.480]  I'm covering you, Gavin.
[29:12.920 --> 29:13.720]  What did you say to me?
[29:15.020 --> 29:16.200]  I just complimented you.
[29:16.420 --> 29:16.840]  Oh, thanks.
[29:17.120 --> 29:19.620]  I just said it was a good idea to move the truck to you.
[29:19.740 --> 29:20.240]  All right, jump on.
[29:21.040 --> 29:21.600]  Let's go, boys.
[29:22.100 --> 29:22.860]  Remember to eat and...
[29:22.860 --> 29:24.060]  We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going.
[29:24.120 --> 29:25.540]  Eat your armors and your peas and q's.
[29:28.440 --> 29:30.120]  Eat your q's, suck your peas.
[29:31.780 --> 29:32.020]  What?
[29:32.180 --> 29:32.360]  What?
[29:32.660 --> 29:32.960]  What?
[29:33.800 --> 29:34.440]  Suck them down.
[29:35.660 --> 29:37.260]  You call feet peas?
[29:42.380 --> 29:43.780]  Size 10 peas.
[29:44.780 --> 29:45.140]  Yeah.
[29:45.580 --> 29:46.920]  Hey, no.
[29:47.760 --> 29:48.100]  Where are we?
[29:48.260 --> 29:48.680]  Oh, okay.
[29:51.880 --> 29:52.880]  Come on.
[29:54.600 --> 29:56.660]  You inaccurate piece of shit, hit him.
[29:58.200 --> 29:59.700]  Yeah, no kidding, me too.
[30:02.240 --> 30:04.340]  How many times are we going to unload into that?
[30:04.940 --> 30:05.300]  Cabin.
[30:05.540 --> 30:07.420]  Dude, this car will not stop.
[30:07.560 --> 30:08.520]  It's Terminator, fuck.
[30:08.780 --> 30:09.220]  Oh, there it goes.
[30:09.260 --> 30:09.760]  There it goes.
[30:10.700 --> 30:11.420]  God damn.
[30:15.060 --> 30:15.780]  That sucked.
[30:16.040 --> 30:16.400]  Shortcut.
[30:16.820 --> 30:20.320]  Oh, I would have taken it if I saw it.
[30:20.440 --> 30:21.200]  I didn't see it.
[30:21.740 --> 30:22.980]  He wanted you to jump the bridge.
[30:23.480 --> 30:26.260]  Back around, back around, turn, hard turn, big hairpin.
[30:26.480 --> 30:26.820]  Oh, God.
[30:27.380 --> 30:28.820]  Oh, boy.
[30:29.300 --> 30:30.400]  Oh, I think you may have...
[30:30.400 --> 30:30.820]  Oh, I think we're going the wrong way, buddy.
[30:30.940 --> 30:33.180]  Yep, yep, yep, sure did.
[30:34.140 --> 30:34.560]  Go around.
[30:36.160 --> 30:37.240]  Yeah, sliding over.
[30:37.360 --> 30:37.600]  Nailed it.
[30:37.880 --> 30:38.300]  Sliding in.
[30:40.360 --> 30:41.040]  Sliding in.
[30:41.320 --> 30:42.280]  Pulling up to the warehouse.
[30:43.760 --> 30:44.200]  We did it.
[30:44.600 --> 30:45.300]  Look at that.
[30:45.880 --> 30:46.300]  Nice.
[30:47.760 --> 30:48.400]  God damn.
[30:48.540 --> 30:50.940]  Oh, we could definitely squeeze another set up into this vid.
[30:51.780 --> 30:52.540]  Yeah, we could do it.
[30:52.720 --> 30:53.000]  Another one.
[30:53.280 --> 30:54.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[30:57.080 --> 30:58.780]  Oh, yeah, that's half a video right there.
[30:58.880 --> 30:59.700]  I don't like this guy.
[31:01.440 --> 31:02.560]  Yeah, Ron.
[31:03.080 --> 31:04.380]  Yeah, I'm not a fan of Ron.
[31:04.720 --> 31:05.320]  I hear that.
[31:07.700 --> 31:09.840]  Does the UV light detect piss?
[31:12.380 --> 31:14.240]  It detects a lot of things, doesn't it?
[31:14.260 --> 31:14.460]  It might.
[31:15.120 --> 31:17.900]  I think it's blood and piss and cum, isn't it?
[31:18.160 --> 31:18.640]  And blood.
[31:18.840 --> 31:19.520]  I think it's...
[31:19.520 --> 31:23.900]  I think blood, piss and cum all has a similar...
[31:23.900 --> 31:24.400]  Oh, platinum.
[31:24.720 --> 31:25.180]  Hell, yeah.
[31:25.880 --> 31:26.440]  All has what?
[31:27.000 --> 31:27.840]  Yeah, it's my date.
[31:28.000 --> 31:29.540]  I got my date of birth in money.
[31:32.060 --> 31:33.640]  You're born on blood, piss and cum?
[31:35.480 --> 31:36.520]  Doesn't make any sense.
[31:37.540 --> 31:38.320]  No, it doesn't.
[31:38.380 --> 31:39.420]  I just wanted to say it.
[31:39.520 --> 31:41.080]  He was born of blood, piss and cum.
[31:42.560 --> 31:43.200]  Oh, no.
[31:44.860 --> 31:46.620]  That old Ricky Gervais song, blood.
[31:46.880 --> 31:47.180]  What was it?
[31:47.400 --> 31:48.540]  Or was it blood, sweat and cum?
[31:49.200 --> 31:49.900]  I don't know.
[31:50.200 --> 31:50.700]  It was a classic.
[31:51.300 --> 31:53.560]  I think I know Ricky Gervais's musical catalog.
[31:55.000 --> 31:56.980]  It used to be like joke songs for the radio.
[31:58.840 --> 32:00.440]  I don't remember his radio program.
[32:01.780 --> 32:02.960]  I think it was blood, sweat and cum.
[32:05.200 --> 32:06.360]  That's totally different.
[32:07.100 --> 32:09.180]  I am going to the apartment.
[32:12.000 --> 32:12.440]  Okay.
[32:13.680 --> 32:14.640]  If I'm in your...
[32:16.360 --> 32:16.800]  thing.
[32:17.880 --> 32:19.740]  Associate vehicles buzzed.
[32:20.780 --> 32:21.500]  There we go.
[32:23.140 --> 32:24.200]  Oh, you think you can...
[32:24.200 --> 32:24.940]  Oh, did you just call it?
[32:25.300 --> 32:25.780]  Oh, hell yeah.
[32:26.020 --> 32:26.580]  Nick found it.
[32:26.800 --> 32:27.140]  I did.
[32:27.300 --> 32:27.780]  Wow, that's fast.
[32:28.780 --> 32:30.380]  Yeah, Nick found it fast.
[32:30.400 --> 32:31.340]  Hop in, lads.
[32:33.220 --> 32:34.100]  Let's go.
[32:36.280 --> 32:36.900]  Uh-oh.
[32:39.660 --> 32:41.080]  Go pick up Andrew.
[32:41.420 --> 32:41.840]  Okay.
[32:42.040 --> 32:42.920]  I'm already at the place.
[32:43.080 --> 32:43.520]  Never mind.
[32:45.040 --> 32:45.940]  Let's get him anyway.
[32:47.700 --> 32:48.760]  Crash into my apartment.
[32:49.220 --> 32:49.800]  Yeah, let's do that.
[32:50.720 --> 32:51.680]  I'm almost up there.
[32:51.720 --> 32:52.620]  Are you guys flying over?
[32:53.840 --> 32:54.940]  We are now.
[32:56.040 --> 32:57.840]  Let me see if I can see you through the window.
[32:59.860 --> 33:00.500]  Where'd you go?
[33:02.480 --> 33:03.440]  Oh, I see you.
[33:03.880 --> 33:04.560]  You do?
[33:05.440 --> 33:05.840]  Yep.
[33:07.720 --> 33:08.500]  Oh, you...
[33:08.500 --> 33:08.840]  Oh, you...
[33:08.840 --> 33:09.480]  You looked it up.
[33:19.340 --> 33:19.740]  Well...
[33:19.740 --> 33:21.200]  This is not a real song.
[33:21.620 --> 33:22.120]  Just for us.
[33:22.260 --> 33:22.740]  It is.
[33:22.860 --> 33:24.060]  We can't use this.
[33:25.560 --> 33:27.520]  Who's that gonna be copyright struck by?
[33:27.620 --> 33:28.280]  Ricky Gervais?
[33:28.500 --> 33:29.940]  A non-existent radio station?
[33:31.800 --> 33:34.100]  Well, we did get copyright struck by Rooster Teeth.
[33:35.000 --> 33:35.380]  That's fair.
[33:35.500 --> 33:36.060]  Where are we going?
[33:37.140 --> 33:37.460]  Nowhere.
[33:38.340 --> 33:41.860]  I thought you were gonna crash into my building while I was looking at you.
[33:42.040 --> 33:45.300]  But I moved in with a series of bikers.
[33:46.860 --> 33:47.820]  Oh, shit.
[33:49.040 --> 33:49.900]  No, no, no.
[33:49.960 --> 33:50.920]  No, no, no, no, no.
[33:52.920 --> 33:53.520]  Eric did.
[33:53.800 --> 33:54.320]  Oh, Eric did.
[33:54.960 --> 33:55.980]  I ran into the wall.
[33:56.380 --> 33:56.560]  Hey.
[33:56.780 --> 33:57.220]  There you go.
[33:57.780 --> 34:00.220]  Let's see if we survive jumping into that pool, Gavin.
[34:02.940 --> 34:04.940]  I accepted the invite halfway down.
[34:04.940 --> 34:07.280]  Okay, well, I'm gonna see if I land in the pool.
[34:08.680 --> 34:09.480]  What happened to my bike?
[34:09.520 --> 34:09.820]  I didn't.
[34:10.720 --> 34:11.260]  So what's this one?
[34:11.500 --> 34:11.860]  Bikers?
[34:12.280 --> 34:13.280]  Series of bikers.
[34:13.620 --> 34:14.660]  A series of bikers?
[34:14.940 --> 34:16.860]  We gotta be stealthy, it looks like.
[34:17.640 --> 34:17.920]  Uh-oh.
[34:18.180 --> 34:18.580]  Uh-oh.
[34:19.260 --> 34:19.660]  Oh, yeah.
[34:19.940 --> 34:22.040]  On the quiet and bring their vans to Ron.
[34:22.640 --> 34:23.460]  They should be loaded with...
[34:23.460 --> 34:23.920]  Fuck Ron.
[34:25.640 --> 34:28.060]  You know Ron is testing the merch.
[34:29.220 --> 34:29.900]  Oh, yeah.
[34:30.260 --> 34:31.320]  Not much to customize.
[34:31.720 --> 34:31.940]  No.
[34:32.380 --> 34:34.040]  Dude, come on.
[34:34.040 --> 34:35.420]  Let me wear my fucking mask.
[34:37.340 --> 34:37.660]  Sucks.
[34:38.280 --> 34:39.940]  I do like that your body hair...
[34:39.940 --> 34:40.580]  Is that body hair?
[34:40.680 --> 34:41.180]  Is that a scar?
[34:41.320 --> 34:41.600]  I...
[34:41.600 --> 34:41.760]  What?
[34:41.840 --> 34:42.060]  Yeah.
[34:42.300 --> 34:42.520]  Yeah.
[34:42.900 --> 34:43.920]  Oh, no, it's body hair.
[34:44.140 --> 34:44.380]  It looks like a reverse tail.
[34:44.440 --> 34:44.900]  Oh, it's body hair.
[34:44.900 --> 34:46.420]  It looks like you got your tail up in the front.
[34:46.920 --> 34:47.440]  Yeah, dude.
[34:47.460 --> 34:48.680]  I'm doing it rat style, baby.
[34:49.980 --> 34:51.000]  Gavin, you have to ready up.
[34:51.960 --> 34:52.660]  Gotta pick my car.
[34:54.300 --> 34:54.620]  What?
[34:55.240 --> 34:55.980]  Picking his vehicle.
[34:56.900 --> 34:57.220]  Oh.
[34:57.540 --> 34:57.840]  I'm actually...
[34:57.840 --> 34:59.180]  I'm bringing vehicles to this team.
[34:59.720 --> 35:00.020]  Oh.
[35:00.120 --> 35:00.640]  Yeah, me too.
[35:00.700 --> 35:01.420]  You don't bring anything.
[35:03.380 --> 35:04.020]  It doesn't...
[35:04.020 --> 35:05.080]  Yeah, not even your mask.
[35:05.620 --> 35:06.960]  I might not own any of you.
[35:07.120 --> 35:07.520]  What?
[35:07.880 --> 35:08.460]  That would explain it.
[35:08.480 --> 35:10.200]  You made you buy one when you started the game.
[35:11.220 --> 35:12.700]  Yeah, I don't know that I have it anymore.
[35:13.520 --> 35:16.160]  Well, you have to call the insurance company and have it repaired.
[35:16.860 --> 35:17.720]  I'm not calling them.
[35:19.200 --> 35:19.840]  Oh, okay.
[35:20.660 --> 35:21.540]  Mr. Proud Man.
[35:22.520 --> 35:24.120]  I'm not calling the insurance.
[35:24.320 --> 35:25.220]  Just steal another car.
[35:25.980 --> 35:26.780]  I'm gonna get there first.
[35:27.000 --> 35:27.220]  Grand Theft Auto.
[35:27.560 --> 35:28.680]  Not Grand Theft Insurance.
[35:30.020 --> 35:31.060]  Well, that's because you're paying them.
[35:31.340 --> 35:31.800]  I'm gonna get there first.
[35:32.060 --> 35:32.580]  Oh, shit.
[35:33.300 --> 35:34.320]  That bike's fast.
[35:34.560 --> 35:35.700]  Oh, boy, Gavin.
[35:35.800 --> 35:36.260]  That was close.
[35:37.320 --> 35:39.440]  Wow, Nick's... Nick's holding a head.
[35:39.920 --> 35:40.260]  Look at that.
[35:40.340 --> 35:40.940]  Getting there first.
[35:41.020 --> 35:41.630]  I'm gonna let you guys take the...
[35:42.980 --> 35:43.840]  Nick, shit.
[35:43.840 --> 35:44.320]  Oh, no!
[35:44.520 --> 35:45.880]  Jesus Christ.
[35:48.740 --> 35:49.280]  Ouch.
[35:51.480 --> 35:52.000]  Oh, shit.
[35:52.000 --> 35:52.420]  That was awesome.
[35:52.940 --> 35:53.380]  Let's go.
[35:53.660 --> 35:54.080]  What's wrong?
[35:56.720 --> 35:57.260]  Thanks.
[35:57.720 --> 35:58.340]  Excuse me.
[36:00.600 --> 36:01.680]  All right.
[36:09.700 --> 36:10.740]  Oh, no.
[36:12.360 --> 36:15.500]  Of everyone that hit us, it was freaking Nick or Andrew.
[36:15.800 --> 36:16.400]  Yeah, it was Andrew.
[36:16.580 --> 36:16.980]  Ow!
[36:20.510 --> 36:22.670]  I mean, normally, it probably would be me.
[36:26.670 --> 36:28.410]  I'm gonna go as the crow rides.
[36:29.090 --> 36:29.250]  Oops.
[36:32.090 --> 36:33.990]  The crow doesn't ride very high.
[36:34.430 --> 36:35.410]  Based on last weekend.
[36:36.910 --> 36:37.550]  Oh, boy.
[36:37.650 --> 36:38.670]  Let me tell you about the crow.
[36:41.150 --> 36:41.870]  It is...
[36:41.870 --> 36:42.770]  Oh, boy.
[36:43.450 --> 36:46.810]  I haven't seen it, but I saw a YouTube video that just named it worst film of the year.
[36:47.510 --> 36:48.490]  It might be.
[36:48.830 --> 36:49.830]  Yeah, it might be.
[36:51.190 --> 36:51.550]  Impressive.
[36:56.640 --> 36:57.460]  Gavin left me.
[36:58.360 --> 36:58.900]  Well, you got off.
[36:58.940 --> 36:59.240]  Why?
[36:59.580 --> 37:00.100]  Yeah, I know.
[37:00.160 --> 37:01.220]  I tried to get back on.
[37:01.640 --> 37:01.800]  Oh.
[37:02.760 --> 37:02.980]  Yeah.
[37:03.320 --> 37:04.380]  Not too late now, I'm afraid.
[37:05.360 --> 37:05.620]  I mean...
[37:05.620 --> 37:07.220]  Yeah, hopefully there's just a car around here, I guess.
[37:08.040 --> 37:09.260]  What made you get off?
[37:09.900 --> 37:11.420]  Uh, I thought you were about to run into the wall.
[37:11.640 --> 37:12.940]  It was Nick, we're talking about Pete.
[37:14.480 --> 37:14.920]  That...
[37:14.920 --> 37:15.180]  No!
[37:17.360 --> 37:17.800]  No!
[37:20.560 --> 37:21.440]  That's, uh...
[37:21.440 --> 37:23.180]  Can you imagine if we were actually right about that?
[37:23.720 --> 37:24.740]  It's like his secret.
[37:25.100 --> 37:25.880]  Not in defeat!
[37:26.700 --> 37:28.220]  Nick was secretly a foot guy.
[37:30.200 --> 37:31.420]  That's not my thing.
[37:31.980 --> 37:33.120]  The, uh...
[37:34.300 --> 37:39.180]  I've opened a window, and now the piss is just combining with the gasoline of the leaf blower.
[37:39.240 --> 37:40.140]  I think it's worse.
[37:41.120 --> 37:41.500]  Piss-a-lean.
[37:41.880 --> 37:42.320]  Piss-a-lean.
[37:44.620 --> 37:46.000]  Maybe it's piss-a-lean.
[37:46.160 --> 37:47.020]  Oh, I had a tree.
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.960]  Sorry, sir, madam, whoever you were.
[37:54.100 --> 37:54.920]  What is Maybelline?
[37:55.700 --> 37:56.260]  Is that a butter?
[37:57.040 --> 37:57.480]  Makeup?
[37:57.520 --> 37:57.960]  Butter?
[37:58.700 --> 37:58.840]  What?
[37:59.100 --> 37:59.540]  Hang on.
[38:00.080 --> 38:01.140]  Wake up every morning.
[38:01.820 --> 38:03.100]  Spread some Maybelline on toast.
[38:03.120 --> 38:03.900]  I just don't remember.
[38:04.460 --> 38:07.620]  It could be, like, in my head, I was thinking, like, maybe a cream cheese.
[38:07.920 --> 38:09.080]  I just remember the slogan.
[38:09.240 --> 38:10.720]  I don't remember anything else about the product.
[38:10.880 --> 38:13.300]  Maybe she's born with cream cheese?
[38:13.900 --> 38:15.440]  Maybe it's cream cheese?
[38:15.540 --> 38:17.280]  Oh, I just thought maybe it's Maybelline.
[38:17.360 --> 38:18.080]  That's all I remembered.
[38:18.260 --> 38:18.420]  Yeah.
[38:19.780 --> 38:22.440]  I thought maybe it was like, uh, like a fake butter.
[38:22.560 --> 38:23.820]  But why would she be born with it?
[38:24.560 --> 38:26.580]  I don't remember that part of the thing.
[38:26.640 --> 38:27.960]  I just remembered maybe it's Maybelline.
[38:28.420 --> 38:29.320]  Maybe she's born with it.
[38:29.320 --> 38:30.520]  It's like the setup line.
[38:31.080 --> 38:32.460]  Wait, is her name Maybelline?
[38:32.460 --> 38:35.300]  No, I don't see.
[38:35.380 --> 38:36.300]  I don't know what's going on.
[38:36.880 --> 38:40.200]  Maybelline is a name, but it's not one specific person.
[38:40.560 --> 38:43.160]  Mabel and Eileen.
[38:43.680 --> 38:46.060]  It's probably the most unsure slogan.
[38:47.920 --> 38:50.540]  Maybe she's born with it, or maybe it's the same.
[38:50.740 --> 38:53.960]  Yeah, we haven't identified whether she's naturally very beautiful
[38:53.960 --> 38:56.680]  and her hair looks amazing, or if it's Maybelline.
[38:56.920 --> 38:57.440]  But we won't...
[38:57.440 --> 38:58.700]  We won't spoil it here.
[38:58.760 --> 38:59.960]  We won't figure it out in this ad.
[39:00.100 --> 39:00.400]  Bye.
[39:00.980 --> 39:01.340]  Yeah.
[39:01.700 --> 39:01.960]  Yeah.
[39:01.960 --> 39:03.140]  Yeah, we won't spoil it.
[39:03.340 --> 39:04.140]  No spoilers.
[39:04.740 --> 39:05.740]  We won't tell you if it's Maybelline.
[39:05.820 --> 39:06.320]  No spoilers.
[39:06.760 --> 39:08.040]  If it was maybe she's born with it.
[39:08.180 --> 39:08.460]  No.
[39:08.820 --> 39:09.560]  No, you're wrong.
[39:09.620 --> 39:10.380]  It's Maybelline.
[39:10.560 --> 39:11.160]  That would be more...
[39:11.820 --> 39:12.600]  Right at that.
[39:12.780 --> 39:15.420]  I think it's less catchy if it's no, no, you're wrong.
[39:17.400 --> 39:19.080]  No, no, you're wrong.
[39:21.200 --> 39:26.540]  This is like doing that bounty thing that we had to do on Inbetween
[39:26.540 --> 39:29.060]  because this is so fucking far.
[39:29.160 --> 39:29.560]  It is.
[39:29.560 --> 39:32.380]  Well, yeah, it said go to Trevor's and we were down in the city.
[39:33.380 --> 39:34.160]  Nick, where are you going?
[39:34.460 --> 39:35.420]  I know, it's awful.
[39:35.540 --> 39:36.000]  Where are you going?
[39:36.860 --> 39:37.180]  Trevor's.
[39:38.180 --> 39:38.920]  Okay, I'll see you there.
[39:40.180 --> 39:42.040]  Do you think you can get there before I get to you?
[39:42.440 --> 39:43.420]  Yeah, I'm about to be there.
[39:45.140 --> 39:45.440]  Hey.
[39:49.220 --> 39:49.860]  You were...
[39:49.860 --> 39:50.880]  Turns out you were right.
[39:51.200 --> 39:51.520]  Congratulations.
[39:55.880 --> 39:56.780]  What are we doing here?
[39:58.600 --> 39:59.660]  Why'd you park over there?
[39:59.660 --> 40:01.140]  Oh, there's guns.
[40:03.500 --> 40:04.720]  Oh, you can put on a mask.
[40:04.820 --> 40:05.100]  Yes!
[40:06.240 --> 40:06.640]  Yes!
[40:09.960 --> 40:11.460]  We're going on a boat!
[40:11.880 --> 40:13.060]  Oh, maybe it's the pub.
[40:13.640 --> 40:14.620]  A little dingy dock.
[40:15.480 --> 40:15.940]  Do it, boys.
[40:16.220 --> 40:16.960]  Wait, wait, wait.
[40:17.000 --> 40:17.520]  Andrew, let me in.
[40:18.240 --> 40:18.440]  Andrew!
[40:18.960 --> 40:19.320]  I'm waiting.
[40:20.540 --> 40:21.540]  I'm on a boat.
[40:21.560 --> 40:21.840]  Let's do it.
[40:22.380 --> 40:23.140]  Don't you ever.
[40:23.380 --> 40:24.020]  I almost lost my bike.
[40:26.720 --> 40:27.520]  Holy shit!
[40:28.320 --> 40:28.720]  Woohoo!
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.540]  And we did it.
[40:29.560 --> 40:30.400]  Oh my god!
[40:32.320 --> 40:33.680]  How did you even lose your car?
[40:33.920 --> 40:34.640]  Why can't I get out?
[40:34.800 --> 40:35.260]  There we go.
[40:35.340 --> 40:35.680]  There we go.
[40:36.060 --> 40:37.320]  We were trapped.
[40:37.680 --> 40:38.800]  We were in the deathproof car.
[40:40.780 --> 40:42.380]  Do the dingy.
[40:43.200 --> 40:44.200]  I've masked up.
[40:44.280 --> 40:45.980]  I've taken my helmet off and put a mask on.
[40:51.350 --> 40:53.190]  Take the dingy to the shore.
[40:53.870 --> 40:55.010]  We just were there.
[40:56.230 --> 40:59.090]  I just drove past that place to get to Trevor.
[41:02.010 --> 41:08.170]  I'm gonna take my mask off.
[41:08.390 --> 41:09.390]  Why'd you take it off?
[41:12.530 --> 41:13.330]  That's back.
[41:13.550 --> 41:14.330]  Thank god.
[41:14.970 --> 41:16.710]  Let me be the mouse.
[41:17.030 --> 41:19.350]  God, look at this cluster of dipshits in this dingy.
[41:21.290 --> 41:24.850]  I like your glowing outfit in this sneak attack.
[41:24.990 --> 41:26.050]  Yeah, the stealth mission.
[41:26.290 --> 41:28.490]  I think I've done every stealth mission in this suit.
[41:30.550 --> 41:31.970]  Then there's Evel Knievel.
[41:32.110 --> 41:33.070]  Also stand out.
[41:34.810 --> 41:37.650]  I'm ready for a cool stunt at all times.
[41:40.070 --> 41:41.290]  I can give you one.
[41:41.630 --> 41:42.350]  Launches onto the beach.
[41:43.070 --> 41:43.950]  Cool stunt coming up.
[41:44.570 --> 41:46.030]  And we are slacking.
[41:46.290 --> 41:46.570]  Uh-oh.
[41:46.670 --> 41:47.650]  Yep, cool stunt coming up.
[41:51.230 --> 41:51.710]  Stunt!
[41:51.990 --> 41:53.130]  Oh my god.
[41:54.230 --> 41:54.590]  Yeah!
[41:55.090 --> 41:56.050]  Andrew jumped off.
[41:56.050 --> 41:58.130]  Okay, take out the lost MC without alerting them.
[41:58.310 --> 41:59.070]  I'm letting them know.
[42:00.110 --> 42:00.350]  Yep.
[42:00.490 --> 42:01.870]  Yes, without alerting them.
[42:05.030 --> 42:06.530]  Is your laser gun silenced?
[42:07.310 --> 42:08.750]  I don't think so.
[42:09.590 --> 42:11.070]  It'll tell you if it is a suppressor.
[42:13.930 --> 42:16.630]  But is a laser gun suppressed?
[42:18.430 --> 42:19.990]  I missed, but someone else didn't.
[42:19.990 --> 42:20.250]  Nice shot.
[42:22.370 --> 42:23.270]  All right, careful.
[42:23.370 --> 42:25.570]  They have overlapping fields of view.
[42:26.270 --> 42:28.290]  I'm gonna get up on this caravan.
[42:32.230 --> 42:33.910]  Yep, I'm sneaking around the left.
[42:41.550 --> 42:42.070]  Uh-oh.
[42:44.070 --> 42:44.770]  I got that guy.
[42:44.970 --> 42:45.590]  Got him, you got him.
[42:45.690 --> 42:46.070]  You're all right.
[42:46.830 --> 42:47.030]  Go.
[42:49.490 --> 42:50.430]  Oh shit, wolves!
[42:50.630 --> 42:50.910]  All right.
[42:56.440 --> 42:56.980]  So I'm gonna let him?
[42:57.360 --> 42:57.720]  No.
[42:58.760 --> 42:59.060]  No.
[43:00.640 --> 43:01.000]  No.
[43:01.880 --> 43:02.840]  I think there's two.
[43:03.040 --> 43:03.540]  You said two.
[43:03.660 --> 43:04.780]  Yeah, they're like back-to-back.
[43:07.820 --> 43:08.720]  Okay, there's one.
[43:09.220 --> 43:09.940]  Nice job!
[43:10.480 --> 43:11.100]  Wow, damn!
[43:11.100 --> 43:12.080]  That was ridiculous.
[43:12.820 --> 43:13.180]  Damn!
[43:13.920 --> 43:14.480]  Way to go, guys.
[43:14.540 --> 43:15.620]  Holy shit!
[43:15.840 --> 43:16.140]  Where are the vans?
[43:16.160 --> 43:17.400]  That was really great.
[43:17.460 --> 43:17.720]  Way to go.
[43:19.700 --> 43:20.100]  Um...
[43:21.660 --> 43:23.400]  Uh-oh, we got vehicles.
[43:23.800 --> 43:24.620]  Where the vans at?
[43:26.500 --> 43:27.760]  Oh shit, we got guys coming.
[43:28.140 --> 43:29.180]  Maybe they're bringing the vans?
[43:31.540 --> 43:32.380]  Hang on, careful.
[43:35.300 --> 43:36.740]  Silence no longer required.
[43:40.340 --> 43:40.740]  Well...
[43:41.360 --> 43:42.900]  No, I think they're further down.
[43:43.240 --> 43:43.680]  Have you guys...
[43:43.680 --> 43:44.620]  Do you guys see the vans at all?
[43:44.740 --> 43:45.420]  I don't see anything.
[43:45.520 --> 43:46.200]  I need a van hint.
[43:47.480 --> 43:48.200]  They're trucks.
[43:48.360 --> 43:49.320]  They drove a van up.
[43:49.820 --> 43:50.960]  I don't see anything on the...
[43:51.420 --> 43:52.600]  I don't see anything on the map.
[43:52.700 --> 43:53.060]  Doghouse?
[43:54.860 --> 43:57.620]  Okay, that scared the piss out of me.
[43:57.640 --> 43:59.520]  I can't believe this is the step that we're stuck on.
[44:01.340 --> 44:02.840]  What if they just didn't spawn in?
[44:04.260 --> 44:05.380]  This game broken?
[44:05.640 --> 44:06.220]  You're insane.
[44:10.770 --> 44:11.330]  Which one?
[44:11.450 --> 44:11.590]  Four?
[44:11.970 --> 44:12.650]  Not this one.
[44:12.810 --> 44:13.850]  You must be thinking of the other one.
[44:15.470 --> 44:17.050]  Yeah, I don't see them on the map.
[44:17.050 --> 44:19.090]  They must just be around here somewhere.
[44:19.250 --> 44:20.810]  Maybe they're on the inside, like this middle.
[44:22.710 --> 44:23.030]  No.
[44:24.750 --> 44:25.670]  No, not here.
[44:26.370 --> 44:27.070]  Oh, here's a van.
[44:28.950 --> 44:29.590]  On me.
[44:30.710 --> 44:31.730]  They should have just popped up.
[44:31.790 --> 44:32.270]  You're in the back?
[44:32.650 --> 44:33.970]  Oh, oh, in the back, in the back.
[44:34.030 --> 44:34.730]  I got one of them.
[44:36.650 --> 44:37.750]  I guess I'll get the other one here.
[44:37.770 --> 44:38.550]  Who wants to ride with me?
[44:38.610 --> 44:39.010]  Is there any two?
[44:39.150 --> 44:39.370]  Andrew?
[44:39.790 --> 44:40.570]  Yeah, I'm coming with you, Nick.
[44:42.550 --> 44:44.290]  You want to ride in the back of everything.
[44:44.770 --> 44:45.210]  What's with that?
[44:45.290 --> 44:45.770]  Oh, shit.
[44:46.070 --> 44:46.870]  Got my bike again.
[44:48.090 --> 44:50.090]  Well, it's easier to cover, I think, right?
[44:54.130 --> 44:55.770]  I guess it's full of stuff.
[44:56.370 --> 44:56.710]  Right.
[44:57.030 --> 44:58.650]  Well, I'm waiting for Gavin to get in.
[44:59.350 --> 44:59.970]  Oh, chill out.
[45:00.090 --> 45:01.870]  Okay, well, I'm waiting for Gavin to get in as well.
[45:11.820 --> 45:13.380]  Are they coming after us?
[45:14.300 --> 45:15.260]  So far, no.
[45:15.380 --> 45:16.240]  I don't think so.
[45:16.280 --> 45:16.820]  We killed them.
[45:18.320 --> 45:21.180]  The thing was timed out for us to find the vans instantly.
[45:23.120 --> 45:23.720]  We did.
[45:24.520 --> 45:25.300]  Find the vans.
[45:25.480 --> 45:25.920]  Nope.
[45:26.080 --> 45:26.840]  We didn't do that.
[45:27.080 --> 45:27.180]  Whoa.
[45:27.520 --> 45:28.160]  Oh, shit.
[45:28.960 --> 45:30.060]  They did find us.
[45:30.140 --> 45:30.920]  Yeah, they...
[45:30.920 --> 45:31.140]  What's up?
[45:31.180 --> 45:32.280]  Right in front of us.
[45:36.240 --> 45:43.220]  Hey, nice shooting.
[45:43.660 --> 45:44.440]  Thank you.
[45:48.300 --> 45:49.280]  Oh, wow.
[45:49.820 --> 45:49.980]  Ramming.
[45:50.920 --> 45:51.260]  Thanks.
[45:51.420 --> 45:52.160]  I can't believe he lived.
[45:53.700 --> 45:54.460]  One in front.
[45:54.660 --> 45:55.440]  Run him down, Eric.
[45:56.240 --> 45:56.500]  There.
[45:57.660 --> 45:58.100]  Oh.
[45:58.100 --> 45:58.460]  Trying.
[46:04.270 --> 46:05.390]  Oh, shit.
[46:06.510 --> 46:08.710]  Just going to hit every motorcyclist.
[46:09.730 --> 46:11.310]  Oh, that guy flipped.
[46:12.130 --> 46:12.890]  Oh, yeah.
[46:16.510 --> 46:18.050]  Oh, she's a snake.
[46:18.390 --> 46:19.110]  We're okay.
[46:19.170 --> 46:19.450]  We're okay.
[46:23.200 --> 46:26.220]  I think we have a long drive in front of us.
[46:26.520 --> 46:27.260]  Can confirm.
[46:31.440 --> 46:32.360]  Laughing that.
[46:32.360 --> 46:33.520]  They crashed into each other.
[46:35.440 --> 46:38.600]  Nick is ramming into every vehicle of theirs that he can.
[46:38.900 --> 46:39.800]  What the fuck?
[46:39.900 --> 46:40.140]  Listen.
[46:40.240 --> 46:40.680]  Who's this?
[46:41.220 --> 46:41.680]  This is some.
[46:42.120 --> 46:42.300]  Yeah.
[46:42.320 --> 46:42.800]  I just hit a guy.
[46:43.520 --> 46:44.400]  And it, like, flipped.
[46:44.520 --> 46:45.580]  Dude, sent us sailing.
[46:46.280 --> 46:47.120]  That was crazy.
[46:47.740 --> 46:50.740]  Oh, Andrew, did you see that guy?
[46:50.820 --> 46:52.840]  He fucking spun out.
[46:54.380 --> 46:54.960]  Dropped him.
[46:55.660 --> 46:56.160]  Oh, no, we didn't.
[46:56.240 --> 46:56.480]  Never mind.
[46:56.520 --> 46:59.160]  I think half of these are just civilians caught up in the crossfire.
[47:00.380 --> 47:01.060]  I can't tell.
[47:01.180 --> 47:01.840]  Oh, in the middle.
[47:04.940 --> 47:05.940]  Running over a bike.
[47:06.980 --> 47:07.800]  Oh, no.
[47:08.120 --> 47:08.960]  What happened?
[47:09.500 --> 47:11.320]  We just did a full front flip.
[47:12.980 --> 47:15.640]  Wow, that was crazy.
[47:17.240 --> 47:18.540]  But that guy got out of the way.
[47:18.600 --> 47:19.100]  Did you see that?
[47:19.280 --> 47:20.220]  That was real good, Nick.
[47:20.880 --> 47:21.620]  You spooked him.
[47:22.680 --> 47:23.400]  He was scared.
[47:23.660 --> 47:24.200]  Here comes another one.
[47:24.380 --> 47:24.480]  Yeah.
[47:28.880 --> 47:30.300]  I didn't hit him once.
[47:30.360 --> 47:31.380]  I missed every shot.
[47:36.520 --> 47:38.720]  Sorry, I'm trying to get to body armor here on the list.
[47:38.940 --> 47:39.960]  Gavin's a hell of a gunman.
[47:43.180 --> 47:45.180]  I was about to say, are you guys getting shot at?
[47:45.240 --> 47:46.820]  Because it seemed pretty low key back there.
[47:46.920 --> 47:47.300]  Do you have ammo?
[47:48.420 --> 47:49.180]  Are you really?
[47:49.700 --> 47:50.900]  No, I just got...
[47:50.900 --> 47:51.920]  There's no way he is.
[47:51.920 --> 47:54.040]  I think I got stuck on a weird angle where I couldn't shoot.
[47:54.840 --> 47:56.080]  All you do is buy ammo.
[47:56.520 --> 47:56.980]  Excuse me.
[48:00.360 --> 48:01.980]  That motorcyclist is following us, Andrew.
[48:02.200 --> 48:02.940]  Yeah, getting him.
[48:06.860 --> 48:07.180]  Well...
[48:07.880 --> 48:09.400]  Well, that like psyched him out.
[48:09.520 --> 48:10.660]  I think that was a good move by you.
[48:10.820 --> 48:14.040]  That was intentional and all part of your strategy.
[48:15.140 --> 48:15.780]  Definitely planned.
[48:15.920 --> 48:16.060]  Yep.
[48:16.260 --> 48:17.480]  And not at all by accident.
[48:19.200 --> 48:19.520]  Whoa!
[48:19.540 --> 48:19.820]  Oh, hey.
[48:20.980 --> 48:21.500]  Hey, guys.
[48:22.000 --> 48:22.640]  What a cross.
[48:25.000 --> 48:25.760]  You guys have fun?
[48:26.500 --> 48:27.440]  Uh, yeah, I had a good time.
[48:27.480 --> 48:28.340]  We did a full front flip.
[48:28.440 --> 48:28.820]  It was pretty great.
[48:28.860 --> 48:29.060]  It was decent.
[48:29.320 --> 48:30.080]  I'm excited to see that footage.
[48:30.080 --> 48:31.320]  I bet you there are drugs in these vans.
[48:32.200 --> 48:32.840]  Oh, Gavin!
[48:38.920 --> 48:39.320]  Wow!
[48:39.500 --> 48:41.480]  It was a reasonable time for those two this time.
[48:41.600 --> 48:42.180]  Now, here's the thing.
[48:42.520 --> 48:43.100]  Do we chance it?
[48:43.140 --> 48:43.720]  Do we do one more?
[48:43.940 --> 48:44.440]  Uh, yeah.
[48:44.720 --> 48:45.100]  Nah.
[48:45.640 --> 48:45.940]  Yeah!
[48:46.500 --> 48:47.540]  In this video?
[48:47.900 --> 48:48.280]  Nah.
[48:48.600 --> 48:48.940]  Yeah.
[48:49.200 --> 48:50.520]  Nah, I think we wrap here.
[48:50.520 --> 48:51.540]  Oh, Gavin said no also.
[48:51.560 --> 48:52.680]  But then we go again, yeah?
[48:53.400 --> 48:55.180]  Yeah, and then we actually start up again.
[48:56.020 --> 48:56.160]  Yeah.
[48:56.260 --> 48:57.260]  Stop down to start up.
[48:58.280 --> 48:58.620]  Oh.
[49:00.140 --> 49:00.880]  It's me!
[49:01.960 --> 49:02.620]  That's me!
[49:05.040 --> 49:05.820]  It's not me.
[49:05.900 --> 49:06.280]  Never mind.
[49:08.460 --> 49:09.620]  It's like lost.
[49:16.020 --> 49:17.580]  Doesn't Echo find those on the plane?
[49:17.980 --> 49:18.640]  Echo and Charlie.
[49:21.220 --> 49:22.580]  Oh yeah, because Charlie's like,
[49:22.700 --> 49:23.920]  Nah, I didn't see anything.
[49:26.380 --> 49:27.460]  Just a bit of heroin.
[49:27.740 --> 49:27.980]  Bronze!
[49:36.540 --> 49:37.440]  I'm platinum, baby.
[49:39.100 --> 49:40.020]  That felt good.
[49:40.400 --> 49:41.240]  That felt real good.
[49:41.760 --> 49:42.460]  That felt great.
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.300]  The garbage was a little tough, but we nailed that second series.
[49:49.260 --> 49:50.500]  It's just a series of bikers.
[49:51.260 --> 49:51.740]  Yep.
[49:53.080 --> 49:54.260]  Oh, it's the rat man.
[49:54.420 --> 49:57.060]  Well, thank you so much for watching this heist set up.
