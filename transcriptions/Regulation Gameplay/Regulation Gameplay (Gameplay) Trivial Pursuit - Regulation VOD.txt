[00:00.000 --> 00:02.220]  Are you guys excited about trivia?
[00:02.760 --> 00:03.000]  Uh-oh.
[00:03.160 --> 00:04.740]  I'm so excited. I love playing trivia.
[00:05.140 --> 00:05.620]  What's wrong, Nick?
[00:05.900 --> 00:08.200]  Oh, okay. I did that thing where you have to wait, and then it says,
[00:08.280 --> 00:08.820]  Do you want to join?
[00:09.800 --> 00:10.240]  Oh, okay.
[00:10.420 --> 00:11.140]  And I was very worried.
[00:11.240 --> 00:11.720]  There we go!
[00:12.240 --> 00:14.060]  You're gonna want to say yes there.
[00:14.160 --> 00:15.980]  Okay. Well, the good news is, I did.
[00:17.120 --> 00:20.280]  What was that thing that GTA would always do to us between rounds?
[00:20.360 --> 00:21.760]  It would ask us if we wanted to do something.
[00:21.860 --> 00:23.700]  If we said yes, it'd suck us out of the game.
[00:23.840 --> 00:24.460]  Do you remember that, Gav?
[00:24.460 --> 00:26.320]  Well, any, like,
[00:27.540 --> 00:30.840]  color, like, lit up area on the map that we accidentally ran into
[00:30.840 --> 00:33.160]  would prompt up a, Do you want to join? with A.
[00:33.240 --> 00:35.960]  But if you're mashing A to sprint, you would just auto-join.
[00:37.780 --> 00:39.780]  Oh, I like your, uh, I like your outfit, Andrew.
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.040]  Thanks!
[00:41.200 --> 00:41.640]  Oh, wow!
[00:42.900 --> 00:45.040]  I'm very fancy. I'm very Bridgerton.
[00:46.200 --> 00:46.600]  Yeah.
[00:47.640 --> 00:49.820]  Oh, he's celebrating the new season of Bridgerton.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.380]  Is this a sponsored stream? Is that what's going on here?
[00:52.580 --> 00:54.400]  Andrew, are you gonna tell us something we didn't know?
[00:54.400 --> 00:58.540]  Is it, is it legal for us to just claim that it is what it isn't?
[00:58.660 --> 00:59.120]  Is that okay?
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.800]  You know, that was the whole point.
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.940]  That was the whole focus of a show we never did at Rooster Teeth,
[01:06.020 --> 01:07.740]  but that we got real close on.
[01:08.060 --> 01:10.480]  The reason we made that stupid mural is called Advertism.
[01:10.780 --> 01:12.540]  We even got so far as to cast it.
[01:12.800 --> 01:16.200]  But the whole point of the show is we were gonna start an advertising agency.
[01:16.520 --> 01:19.460]  And then the way the advertising agency works is you create, like,
[01:19.480 --> 01:23.660]  an edgy, ridiculous ad, and then you just send an invoice to, like, Ford.
[01:23.660 --> 01:25.780]  And go, okay, we made the ad, you have to pay us now.
[01:26.040 --> 01:28.740]  And then we were just gonna, we were gonna film, like, it was gonna be, like,
[01:28.860 --> 01:30.480]  pseudo-real, pseudo-scripted.
[01:31.060 --> 01:34.240]  And, uh, I don't know why we never, it never got off the ground.
[01:34.440 --> 01:38.180]  I think Matt and Bernie just lost interest in it.
[01:38.500 --> 01:38.800]  Yeah.
[01:40.640 --> 01:44.100]  I mean, we were buying his, we were buying his sets for it.
[01:44.640 --> 01:47.340]  If someone was watching 1-800-MAGIC, I would've rathered that.
[01:47.880 --> 01:48.620]  That would've been great.
[01:49.020 --> 01:51.020]  I was really into the idea, I don't know why.
[01:51.020 --> 01:55.300]  It's crazy that that mural was, like, the width of the entire office at one point.
[01:55.840 --> 01:56.060]  Yeah.
[01:56.320 --> 01:59.340]  I wonder what would've happened to that mural. Probably in a fucking dumpster.
[02:00.920 --> 02:01.740]  At this point.
[02:02.200 --> 02:02.700]  I saw it.
[02:02.900 --> 02:03.760]  You don't think anyone claimed it?
[02:03.760 --> 02:03.940]  Did you?
[02:04.180 --> 02:05.740]  I don't know.
[02:06.920 --> 02:07.920]  Maybe somebody claimed it.
[02:08.220 --> 02:09.800]  You think you got quick-started to a dumpster?
[02:13.620 --> 02:16.480]  Alright, I need redemption after the last time we played this game.
[02:17.600 --> 02:18.860]  Alright, well, here we go, we entertained.
[02:19.060 --> 02:19.720]  That's the way to do it.
[02:19.720 --> 02:20.820]  I blew it.
[02:20.820 --> 02:21.600]  Here we go.
[02:21.660 --> 02:22.640]  Here we go.
[02:23.200 --> 02:24.740]  Oh, I know the Beatles.
[02:26.800 --> 02:27.520]  Oh, okay.
[02:27.660 --> 02:28.500]  Alright, okay.
[02:29.020 --> 02:31.020]  We actually had this conversation recently.
[02:33.240 --> 02:35.200]  I got so nervous as soon as I claimed it.
[02:38.500 --> 02:40.600]  You should turn off your notifications.
[02:43.840 --> 02:49.640]  I'll, uh, at the next break, I'll, uh...
[02:49.720 --> 02:51.460]  Guys, get your friend requested now.
[02:59.700 --> 03:01.520]  Everybody send Nick, piss rat.
[03:02.880 --> 03:03.320]  Oh, dear.
[03:03.420 --> 03:05.980]  Is this a fucking, is this a stupid trick question?
[03:08.280 --> 03:09.000]  Damn it.
[03:09.520 --> 03:10.220]  I got it right.
[03:11.100 --> 03:11.600]  Oh, it is?
[03:11.900 --> 03:12.740]  Elon Musk didn't...
[03:12.740 --> 03:13.540]  That's a misconception.
[03:13.720 --> 03:15.140]  Elon Musk didn't found Tesla.
[03:15.260 --> 03:16.640]  He just, like, he bought it at some point.
[03:16.640 --> 03:17.400]  Oh, that's right.
[03:17.660 --> 03:18.040]  Makes sense.
[03:18.040 --> 03:18.700]  Early on.
[03:18.720 --> 03:19.200]  Yeah.
[03:21.800 --> 03:23.160]  Look who's smart.
[03:25.180 --> 03:25.660]  What?
[03:25.960 --> 03:26.760]  Oh, I know this one.
[03:26.820 --> 03:29.020]  Which country is the unicorn the official national animal?
[03:29.340 --> 03:33.100]  I, uh, I don't know the answer to this.
[03:33.100 --> 03:33.540]  I know this one.
[03:33.580 --> 03:34.520]  I'm gonna guess not Greece.
[03:36.080 --> 03:36.720]  You know this, Gavin?
[03:37.620 --> 03:38.280]  Uh, yeah.
[03:38.360 --> 03:39.120]  Why would it be any?
[03:40.040 --> 03:41.040]  Shout out to Bernie.
[03:41.660 --> 03:44.720]  God, what?
[03:44.920 --> 03:45.220]  Scotland?
[03:45.380 --> 03:45.620]  Really?
[03:45.620 --> 03:46.180]  Scotland.
[03:46.680 --> 03:48.200]  Yeah, they love the unicorn.
[03:48.560 --> 03:49.180]  Wouldn't it be the Loch Ness Monster?
[03:50.080 --> 03:50.380]  Yeah.
[03:50.840 --> 03:55.720]  Dude, I'd be pissed the fuck off if I wasn't the national animal of that country.
[03:55.980 --> 03:57.600]  Yeah, that's just a unicorn that got long.
[03:59.220 --> 03:59.740]  What?
[03:59.860 --> 04:00.520]  That's a good point.
[04:00.980 --> 04:02.860]  Brazilian soccer player, Ricardo.
[04:03.640 --> 04:04.280]  Makes sense.
[04:04.400 --> 04:05.700]  It's better known by what name?
[04:06.740 --> 04:09.060]  Stop sending friend requests, damn you!
[04:13.530 --> 04:15.250]  I only recognize one of those names.
[04:15.710 --> 04:16.110]  Shut up.
[04:16.110 --> 04:18.690]  Oh, I read that as Ronaldo.
[04:18.990 --> 04:19.190]  Whoops.
[04:19.830 --> 04:20.670]  I filmed that guy once.
[04:21.050 --> 04:21.470]  You did?
[04:22.330 --> 04:22.350]  Yeah.
[04:22.570 --> 04:23.250]  KakÃ¡ or Ronaldo?
[04:23.950 --> 04:29.890]  Oh, you bitch.
[04:30.150 --> 04:30.950]  Oh, you bitch.
[04:30.970 --> 04:32.030]  You're gonna burn for this.
[04:34.490 --> 04:35.050]  Well...
[04:35.050 --> 04:37.130]  Where is Bile, please?
[04:37.510 --> 04:38.150]  Oh, shit.
[04:39.050 --> 04:39.990]  Uh, Bile?
[04:41.850 --> 04:42.730]  I don't know.
[04:43.010 --> 04:44.110]  I don't...
[04:44.110 --> 04:45.330]  No, that's not right.
[04:45.330 --> 04:49.610]  As someone who is producing it a lot the week towards the launch, I should have known that.
[04:50.110 --> 04:51.490]  You're thick as shit today.
[04:51.850 --> 04:55.110]  I'm glad we're all just fucking dim together.
[04:55.430 --> 04:56.250]  It's Friday, man!
[04:57.070 --> 04:58.470]  Yeah, it's a dim Friday.
[04:58.770 --> 04:59.530]  It's a dim Friday.
[04:59.910 --> 05:00.330]  Stop!
[05:00.970 --> 05:03.710]  You just totally redeemed yourself.
[05:03.830 --> 05:04.650]  Hey, just in time.
[05:05.590 --> 05:08.510]  Which of these sportswear companies was founded first?
[05:08.830 --> 05:10.710]  Sorry, Dr. McSwagpants, I couldn't remember.
[05:11.490 --> 05:14.130]  Uh, we gotta go one at a time and the loser gets to go first.
[05:14.130 --> 05:14.570]  Oh, we do?
[05:14.570 --> 05:15.890]  Uh, yeah.
[05:17.010 --> 05:17.590]  Okay.
[05:18.090 --> 05:19.370]  Nike was first?
[05:19.810 --> 05:20.610]  I don't know.
[05:21.570 --> 05:21.990]  I panicked.
[05:22.090 --> 05:22.810]  I didn't know how much time I had.
[05:22.910 --> 05:23.510]  That was German.
[05:23.910 --> 05:24.510]  Oh, God.
[05:25.850 --> 05:27.010]  Reebok's pretty old.
[05:28.010 --> 05:28.470]  Isn't it?
[05:28.970 --> 05:31.170]  I feel like New Balance is probably old.
[05:31.350 --> 05:33.270]  Do you know that all Americans say Adidas wrong?
[05:33.990 --> 05:34.450]  Yeah!
[05:35.570 --> 05:36.670]  Holy shit!
[05:36.770 --> 05:39.130]  Oh, New Balance is not so new.
[05:39.290 --> 05:40.670]  You two gave me the top two.
[05:41.090 --> 05:41.350]  Wow.
[05:41.650 --> 05:42.760]  They should just be called Balance.
[05:43.540 --> 05:43.940]  Yeah.
[05:44.600 --> 05:45.000]  Yeah.
[05:45.120 --> 05:48.100]  I honestly misread the question and thought I was trying to pick the oldest.
[05:48.600 --> 05:48.880]  And, uh...
[05:49.400 --> 05:49.700]  Oh, shit.
[05:50.480 --> 05:50.940]  No, I did.
[05:52.180 --> 05:55.000]  Which of these Canadian provinces is the largest?
[05:55.180 --> 05:56.140]  Whoa, we're fucked.
[05:56.160 --> 05:56.300]  Oh, well.
[05:56.720 --> 05:57.100]  Oh, boy.
[05:57.620 --> 05:59.020]  Oh, here we go.
[05:59.160 --> 05:59.400]  Boop.
[06:00.160 --> 06:00.720]  I have no idea.
[06:00.880 --> 06:01.180]  Oh, damn.
[06:04.870 --> 06:05.270]  French.
[06:06.210 --> 06:06.610]  Alexa.
[06:08.810 --> 06:09.810]  Don't you do it.
[06:10.070 --> 06:10.750]  Son of a gun.
[06:10.930 --> 06:11.410]  It's not that one?
[06:15.270 --> 06:15.990]  Ontario, Nunavut.
[06:16.150 --> 06:16.910]  Ontario, Nunavut.
[06:17.930 --> 06:18.510]  I'll let you guys pick.
[06:18.650 --> 06:19.430]  Which one should I go with?
[06:19.810 --> 06:20.770]  Has anybody ever...
[06:20.770 --> 06:21.830]  Well, I've never heard of Nunavut.
[06:21.830 --> 06:23.450]  Nunavut's made up, so...
[06:23.450 --> 06:23.650]  Yeah.
[06:24.030 --> 06:27.590]  Yeah, it's actually pronounced none of it, and it doesn't exist.
[06:27.950 --> 06:28.030]  See?
[06:28.210 --> 06:30.310]  See the thing I took for you guys?
[06:30.750 --> 06:31.550]  Oh, shit.
[06:32.030 --> 06:32.310]  Wow.
[06:32.610 --> 06:34.390]  Two million square kilometers?
[06:34.670 --> 06:36.270]  How the hell have I never heard of it?
[06:36.670 --> 06:39.810]  Is that all the shit that's, like, all smashed up at the top of the planet?
[06:41.670 --> 06:44.910]  Which of these regimes or monarchs ruled Spain most recently?
[06:45.350 --> 06:45.970]  Oh, God.
[06:46.270 --> 06:47.070]  Oh, me? No.
[06:47.330 --> 06:47.490]  Christ.
[06:48.090 --> 06:49.050]  Most recently?
[06:50.830 --> 06:53.510]  These questions are an absolute nightmare.
[06:54.970 --> 06:57.170]  Well, this guy has a higher number, so what about that one?
[06:58.610 --> 06:59.050]  You know what?
[06:59.130 --> 06:59.970]  I'm feeling Juan Carlos.
[07:00.530 --> 07:00.990]  Good thinking.
[07:02.110 --> 07:03.170]  Alright, let's see.
[07:03.650 --> 07:03.950]  Shit!
[07:03.950 --> 07:04.730]  Oh my God, yes!
[07:05.970 --> 07:06.350]  Wow.
[07:06.490 --> 07:06.730]  Great, Snake.
[07:07.430 --> 07:08.870]  Wow, that was luck!
[07:08.870 --> 07:10.170]  And nothing else.
[07:10.370 --> 07:10.950]  Damn, man.
[07:12.190 --> 07:13.390]  Hey, I got a wedge, though.
[07:13.790 --> 07:14.310]  Everybody did.
[07:17.610 --> 07:18.790]  I have the lowest score!
[07:19.130 --> 07:19.870]  I get to go first.
[07:20.990 --> 07:22.150]  Crying in my Depends.
[07:22.490 --> 07:24.950]  I just got an idea for my first blindside.
[07:25.890 --> 07:26.170]  Oh.
[07:26.430 --> 07:26.730]  Yeah?
[07:27.230 --> 07:27.590]  Yeah.
[07:28.170 --> 07:31.490]  Well, you completely wasted it in the last run we did.
[07:32.170 --> 07:33.430]  I wouldn't say it was a waste.
[07:34.170 --> 07:36.570]  Well, you didn't use it, so I don't know how it's described.
[07:38.090 --> 07:39.990]  I'm the most...
[07:39.990 --> 07:43.670]  Do people love a giant arena of synth?
[07:45.150 --> 07:45.630]  Actually...
[07:45.630 --> 07:47.310]  I think that's actually the answer.
[07:47.490 --> 07:50.190]  I just fucking did a solo line on this.
[07:50.750 --> 07:53.310]  I did a fucking episode on this, and I think it was...
[07:53.310 --> 07:54.450]  I think you and I got one and two.
[07:54.830 --> 07:56.030]  Oh, wow.
[07:56.050 --> 07:57.550]  I had a feeling it would be huge.
[07:58.050 --> 07:58.270]  Wow!
[07:59.130 --> 07:59.950]  Fucking Rod Stewart.
[08:00.450 --> 08:02.330]  You know, I knew it was Rod Stewart somehow.
[08:03.430 --> 08:03.910]  Really?
[08:04.170 --> 08:04.430]  Yeah.
[08:06.870 --> 08:08.070]  I associate...
[08:08.070 --> 08:09.330]  Big Rod Stewart.
[08:10.070 --> 08:12.850]  I associate with him Oprah for some reason.
[08:12.950 --> 08:13.270]  I'm an Oprah.
[08:14.390 --> 08:16.430]  I don't know how many people...
[08:16.970 --> 08:17.110]  Yes!
[08:17.770 --> 08:18.490]  Yes, thank you!
[08:19.310 --> 08:23.270]  We have 1,200 people watching us be real embarrassed.
[08:23.890 --> 08:25.650]  No, listen, I'm first, so...
[08:26.090 --> 08:27.710]  I guess real embarrassed for all of you.
[08:29.790 --> 08:30.670]  Oh, God!
[08:32.530 --> 08:33.410]  You're true...
[08:33.410 --> 08:33.630]  Yeah!
[08:34.510 --> 08:34.950]  Color...
[08:34.950 --> 08:35.830]  Shining through...
[08:37.610 --> 08:41.090]  I don't even understand the question, to be honest with you.
[08:41.170 --> 08:41.770]  Hey, if you're watching...
[08:41.770 --> 08:44.370]  That is a disease in Game of Thrones.
[08:44.630 --> 08:44.710]  Yeah!
[08:44.750 --> 08:45.950]  It's like color space, isn't it?
[08:47.310 --> 08:48.950]  Yeah, Jorah Mormont's got that.
[08:49.730 --> 08:50.170]  Fuck!
[08:50.970 --> 08:51.510]  Was I right?
[08:51.670 --> 08:52.050]  Yeah!
[08:52.590 --> 08:52.870]  Yeah.
[08:53.370 --> 08:53.730]  Deep...
[08:53.730 --> 08:55.370]  I haven't even heard of deep color.
[08:55.690 --> 08:56.090]  Me neither.
[08:56.950 --> 08:58.170]  A billion colors?
[08:58.710 --> 08:59.570]  Hey, Gavin, is it deep color?
[08:59.570 --> 09:00.150]  It's great value.
[09:00.150 --> 09:03.630]  That's gotta be, like, light blue 78.
[09:05.210 --> 09:07.650]  Can you imagine buying Crayola deep colors version?
[09:07.870 --> 09:08.810]  That's a huge loss.
[09:10.510 --> 09:12.270]  It rides on 1,700 palettes.
[09:14.890 --> 09:15.850]  Oh, Christ.
[09:15.970 --> 09:16.690]  Hey, if you're watching this...
[09:16.690 --> 09:17.390]  That's why there's 1,000 clocks.
[09:17.590 --> 09:18.090]  ...on demand.
[09:18.330 --> 09:20.570]  Look at me sucking dicks on the bottom floor.
[09:20.730 --> 09:21.190]  This sucks.
[09:21.270 --> 09:25.130]  On the YouTube channel later, you can always catch us Fridays, streaming.
[09:25.650 --> 09:25.850]  It's true.
[09:25.850 --> 09:27.330]  Twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod.
[09:27.670 --> 09:29.050]  2 p.m. Central, every Friday.
[09:30.670 --> 09:33.570]  Every Friday, one of us will be sucking that last place cock.
[09:34.810 --> 09:38.090]  You're really into dicks recently, which I know is sort of your thing.
[09:38.330 --> 09:40.730]  But you've really turned it up in the past week.
[09:42.450 --> 09:44.550]  The Warner Brothers can't yell at me.
[09:45.310 --> 09:46.410]  Not that they ever did.
[09:46.670 --> 09:48.930]  Not that Warner Brothers ever was an impediment to me, no.
[09:48.990 --> 09:50.890]  Did anyone that ever...
[09:50.890 --> 09:51.670]  Even though we existed?
[09:52.330 --> 09:53.110]  No, no, no, no.
[09:53.270 --> 09:55.350]  We were completely and totally left alone.
[09:55.490 --> 09:57.670]  I just, you know, I just feel fancy free.
[09:57.670 --> 09:59.710]  And I just want to, I just think about dicks a lot.
[09:59.810 --> 10:00.470]  What do you want me to say?
[10:01.250 --> 10:05.490]  Based on how long it's taking for us to acquire everything we want, the answer is no, Kevin.
[10:05.710 --> 10:06.630]  They're just learning.
[10:08.930 --> 10:11.030]  Yeah, based on some email threads I've seen.
[10:11.630 --> 10:13.250]  What's all the shit we just unplugged?
[10:15.150 --> 10:17.530]  Uh, what year was a bear made the mascot of the Olympics?
[10:17.530 --> 10:21.610]  I didn't know the bear was the mascot of the Olympic Games.
[10:21.910 --> 10:23.230]  Uh, sure.
[10:24.590 --> 10:24.990]  I...
[10:24.990 --> 10:25.910]  Oh, wait. What year?
[10:25.910 --> 10:28.870]  Uh, it was probably before, uh, California, right?
[10:28.990 --> 10:29.410]  What was the...
[10:29.810 --> 10:30.170]  Nightmare.
[10:30.710 --> 10:31.730]  Ah, then I fucked that up.
[10:31.850 --> 10:32.990]  Then I fucked that up.
[10:33.050 --> 10:33.610]  Is that 2000?
[10:34.090 --> 10:34.770]  It was 80.
[10:34.910 --> 10:35.290]  I knew.
[10:35.450 --> 10:36.070]  Fuck me.
[10:36.950 --> 10:37.310]  Stupid.
[10:38.250 --> 10:39.270]  God, I'm stupid.
[10:39.390 --> 10:41.770]  Why do I do the wrong answer when I know the right answer?
[10:43.570 --> 10:44.870]  Who the fuck does that?
[10:44.970 --> 10:47.490]  Who looks at it and goes, oh, it's 1980, I'll pick 2000?
[10:48.110 --> 10:50.750]  What kind of stupid do you have to be to be me?
[10:50.830 --> 10:51.270]  Let's find out.
[10:51.290 --> 10:52.190]  Jesus Christ.
[10:54.350 --> 10:56.530]  Let's see if there's historically anyone dumber.
[10:57.990 --> 11:00.690]  What city known as the gateway to South India was previously called?
[11:01.730 --> 11:03.010]  It's me. The answer's me.
[11:04.290 --> 11:04.730]  Uh...
[11:04.730 --> 11:05.790]  Uh, which city?
[11:06.110 --> 11:06.510]  Yeah, sure.
[11:06.970 --> 11:07.770]  I've heard of that one.
[11:09.810 --> 11:10.250]  Yeah.
[11:10.770 --> 11:11.750]  I want the one I've heard of.
[11:12.590 --> 11:13.410]  Well, fuck.
[11:13.430 --> 11:14.630]  Calcutta used to be...
[11:14.630 --> 11:16.690]  That used to be Calcutta.
[11:18.510 --> 11:19.390]  Can we...
[11:20.010 --> 11:21.490]  maybe not put this out?
[11:22.670 --> 11:23.550]  No, it's live.
[11:23.550 --> 11:24.630]  Put it out, it's live, dude.
[11:24.890 --> 11:25.990]  It's already outing.
[11:26.150 --> 11:27.610]  Yeah, this part is live.
[11:28.890 --> 11:32.890]  There's no way to put the stupid back in the toothpaste bottle, buddy.
[11:33.870 --> 11:36.030]  Uh, which biome is the largest of the world's biomes?
[11:36.310 --> 11:37.150]  I'm thinking about Earth.
[11:38.210 --> 11:39.490]  No, no, think about Minecraft.
[11:40.430 --> 11:40.750]  Uh-oh.
[11:41.130 --> 11:43.610]  Desert was always really big in Minecraft for the biomes.
[11:44.610 --> 11:45.790]  Well, that makes sense.
[11:46.170 --> 11:46.930]  That just makes...
[11:46.930 --> 11:47.650]  Who picked that?
[11:47.650 --> 11:48.010]  What was it?
[11:48.270 --> 11:52.290]  I was locked into Minecraft land, and that's what really...
[11:52.290 --> 11:54.350]  There's hardly any land on this bowl.
[11:56.550 --> 11:57.250]  You're right.
[11:58.290 --> 12:01.050]  That's what took out the aliens and signs. I should have remembered that.
[12:02.550 --> 12:03.710]  Swing for the fences, Andrew.
[12:03.750 --> 12:04.390]  There we go!
[12:05.450 --> 12:05.870]  Alright.
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.300]  Oh, yes!
[12:12.740 --> 12:13.240]  Oh, shit.
[12:13.260 --> 12:14.280]  I don't know their names, though.
[12:14.860 --> 12:15.720]  Uh, yeah.
[12:17.100 --> 12:19.180]  Yeah, well, they made it really...
[12:19.180 --> 12:19.960]  Very easy.
[12:20.400 --> 12:20.980]  Did they?
[12:21.540 --> 12:21.880]  No.
[12:22.100 --> 12:22.820]  They sure did.
[12:23.320 --> 12:23.940]  Oh, God.
[12:23.980 --> 12:25.360]  I don't... I don't know.
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.420]  You shouldn't have said that, Andrew. You shouldn't have said that.
[12:27.960 --> 12:31.720]  Yeah, I was... I regretted it as the words were coming out.
[12:32.380 --> 12:34.360]  That's a show that I know existed.
[12:35.380 --> 12:36.120]  That's about it.
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.640]  It was good. It was a fun show. At least the first time.
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.200]  Calm down.
[12:41.100 --> 12:42.740]  I hate helping Geoff.
[12:42.940 --> 12:45.440]  I know what Nick's gonna blindside us with.
[12:47.220 --> 12:47.740]  Uh...
[12:47.740 --> 12:50.320]  What is a classical art of Japanese flower arranging called?
[12:50.360 --> 12:51.480]  You're fucking welcome.
[12:53.860 --> 12:54.380]  Uh...
[12:54.380 --> 12:55.680]  Oh, I fucked it up!
[12:55.920 --> 12:57.080]  I fucked it up!
[12:57.100 --> 12:59.060]  Oh, my God, I hit the wrong fucking button!
[12:59.400 --> 13:00.200]  It's Ikebana!
[13:00.580 --> 13:01.620]  I hate myself!
[13:02.420 --> 13:04.280]  I fucking hate myself!
[13:10.280 --> 13:11.600]  That'd be a good clip.
[13:11.620 --> 13:14.340]  Just to send to people, let them know we're streaming.
[13:15.580 --> 13:18.000]  God damn it, I suck!
[13:18.540 --> 13:19.740]  Never mind, the clip's still going.
[13:21.500 --> 13:25.860]  Emily has a fucking coffee table book on it!
[13:26.340 --> 13:28.040]  For dickhole's sake!
[13:29.080 --> 13:31.760]  I watched a seminar on it!
[13:32.540 --> 13:34.040]  That was a full-blown Brimley.
[13:35.500 --> 13:41.840]  Oh, shit, I don't know this.
[13:42.140 --> 13:43.680]  I wish I was fucking dead sometimes.
[13:43.680 --> 13:44.740]  You can't be fat, right?
[13:46.620 --> 13:49.820]  At least I'm not too stupid to answer this one.
[13:49.880 --> 13:50.440]  Oh, shit.
[13:52.060 --> 13:54.420]  Yes, I am! Yes, I am!
[13:54.560 --> 13:56.320]  I'm too stupid for that, too!
[13:56.500 --> 13:57.680]  Oh, my God!
[14:05.460 --> 14:06.980]  It doesn't matter!
[14:10.220 --> 14:11.700]  It's clarified butter!
[14:11.980 --> 14:12.840]  God damn it!
[14:14.640 --> 14:15.460]  Oh, shit.
[14:19.560 --> 14:27.850]  I feel like one of these is kind of weird, so I'm going with the one I viewed.
[14:30.350 --> 14:32.530]  Gavin, did you know that?
[14:33.970 --> 14:35.570]  I knew it wasn't chimp.
[14:37.390 --> 14:41.170]  And I feel like tiny stuff has shitloads of chromosomes.
[14:49.690 --> 14:52.290]  Oh, it's turned around.
[14:52.390 --> 14:55.250]  Oh, it's been such a long two months, my brain!
[14:56.590 --> 15:01.270]  Oh, God, have I seen any of these?
[15:01.290 --> 15:04.090]  Jesus, I don't even know what two of these are.
[15:04.090 --> 15:05.250]  I don't think she's in that one.
[15:06.530 --> 15:09.630]  I've seen half of them, and I just don't remember her in...
[15:09.630 --> 15:10.090]  Hey!
[15:10.390 --> 15:11.050]  Oh, wow!
[15:11.090 --> 15:12.550]  She wasn't in Devil Wears Prada, huh?
[15:12.610 --> 15:13.450]  I could have sworn she was.
[15:16.390 --> 15:17.510]  Wow, that was a lucky guess.
[15:17.630 --> 15:18.450]  Oh, I'm loving this.
[15:18.590 --> 15:22.070]  I'm loving that this all-time historic bad game by Geoff is live.
[15:22.730 --> 15:24.130]  It makes me so happy.
[15:24.770 --> 15:29.090]  What if I get last place, and I just have to log out, and I'm not allowed to be in content anymore?
[15:30.010 --> 15:31.670]  You get a place on time-out?
[15:32.470 --> 15:33.370]  But just forever.
[15:34.630 --> 15:36.210]  Just like permanently retired.
[15:36.910 --> 15:38.390]  No, you're going to turn it around right here.
[15:38.510 --> 15:39.830]  Yeah, this is comeback time right here, baby.
[15:39.950 --> 15:40.810]  Round three.
[15:41.390 --> 15:43.930]  I've destroyed my own legacy in one game.
[15:44.370 --> 15:47.210]  I like the clip in the chat, Geoff screwed up again.
[15:50.910 --> 15:52.270]  It's Grab Bag Woods.
[15:54.030 --> 15:54.630]  What is that?
[15:54.670 --> 15:58.150]  Will there be a regulation VOD? This will be posted on YouTube, right?
[15:58.430 --> 15:58.650]  Absolutely.
[15:58.890 --> 16:00.090]  It will be on Tuesday.
[16:00.890 --> 16:06.810]  The upside if you miss the streams is that we record audio locally, so it'll sound a little bit better on the VOD.
[16:07.190 --> 16:07.850]  It will.
[16:08.110 --> 16:09.410]  It won't sound all discorded.
[16:09.850 --> 16:10.470]  Yeah, exactly.
[16:10.910 --> 16:12.390]  Just not for the very first one we did.
[16:13.150 --> 16:13.550]  Yeah.
[16:14.190 --> 16:15.250]  Because we didn't think to.
[16:15.350 --> 16:16.150]  We didn't think about it.
[16:16.370 --> 16:17.630]  Because we're too stupid!
[16:18.890 --> 16:23.950]  So if you want to hear Geoff screaming with higher clarity, make sure you hit up the VOD as well.
[16:26.430 --> 16:28.150]  Yeah, you'll hear him in the background more.
[16:29.210 --> 16:31.750]  Ah, Christ. I'm probably too dumb for this too.
[16:31.910 --> 16:33.090]  Oh, didn't we have this one recently?
[16:33.110 --> 16:34.490]  I think we might have.
[16:35.050 --> 16:35.930]  Yeah, Scotland!
[16:38.250 --> 16:38.650]  Fenix!
[16:39.210 --> 16:40.330]  I mean that has... yeah.
[16:41.670 --> 16:43.090]  Alright, I know where I'm going next.
[16:43.770 --> 16:44.450]  Me too.
[16:45.050 --> 16:46.010]  Will I make it?
[16:46.350 --> 16:47.070]  I got it!
[16:47.170 --> 16:47.590]  Fuck.
[16:48.830 --> 16:49.690]  Oh, fuck.
[16:49.710 --> 16:50.570]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[16:50.690 --> 16:51.450]  Oh, fuck.
[16:51.570 --> 16:52.850]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[16:52.970 --> 16:53.190]  Oh!
[16:55.790 --> 16:56.210]  Werewolf?
[16:56.450 --> 16:57.210]  I don't remember a werewolf.
[16:57.210 --> 16:58.770]  Werewolf was like a main character, wasn't it?
[16:58.870 --> 17:00.070]  Yeah, wasn't it his uncle?
[17:00.590 --> 17:02.210]  Yeah, well, his godfather.
[17:03.010 --> 17:03.110]  I don't remember.
[17:03.110 --> 17:03.730]  I don't remember the werewolf.
[17:03.870 --> 17:05.010]  Sirius Black or whatever?
[17:05.070 --> 17:05.990]  He was a werewolf?
[17:06.310 --> 17:07.010]  I think so.
[17:07.570 --> 17:08.750]  Wait, Sirius was a werewolf?
[17:08.970 --> 17:09.590]  No, not Sirius.
[17:09.590 --> 17:10.570]  It's whatever that he was.
[17:10.570 --> 17:11.290]  Oh, no, the other guy.
[17:11.350 --> 17:11.970]  He got lost in the thing.
[17:12.370 --> 17:13.850]  The guy from Wonder Woman?
[17:13.850 --> 17:17.750]  Most of these items are traditional Indian... are items of traditional Indian clothing.
[17:17.910 --> 17:19.350]  Oh, shit, some of these are food, huh?
[17:20.770 --> 17:21.170]  Uh...
[17:21.170 --> 17:21.730]  Nope.
[17:22.810 --> 17:23.210]  Shit!
[17:25.350 --> 17:25.750]  Uh...
[17:25.750 --> 17:26.150]  I think...
[17:26.150 --> 17:27.570]  It's all... it's like a menu.
[17:27.930 --> 17:28.450]  Damn it!
[17:28.910 --> 17:29.310]  Yes!
[17:29.730 --> 17:30.330]  Yes, yes, yes!
[17:30.330 --> 17:31.530]  All I recognize is food!
[17:34.190 --> 17:35.290]  Oh, shit, there's more!
[17:36.210 --> 17:36.610]  Fuck!
[17:36.630 --> 17:37.110]  Oh, shit!
[17:37.110 --> 17:38.450]  Yes, I got another one!
[17:39.210 --> 17:40.190]  Hell yeah!
[17:42.950 --> 17:43.350]  Oh, wow.
[17:43.590 --> 17:46.710]  How come this didn't happen during the trivia week month?
[17:50.990 --> 17:52.110]  Oh, man.
[17:52.930 --> 17:55.050]  Waterfalls have been tainted for me because of Geoff.
[17:57.070 --> 17:58.210]  That wasn't one.
[18:03.610 --> 18:04.910]  God damn it!
[18:05.090 --> 18:05.250]  Fuck!
[18:06.730 --> 18:07.290]  Shit.
[18:07.510 --> 18:08.250]  Okay, we're moving on.
[18:08.750 --> 18:09.990]  Please take us to the next one.
[18:10.110 --> 18:10.430]  Please.
[18:10.810 --> 18:11.870]  Oh, Nugget Falls.
[18:11.970 --> 18:13.770]  I should've went for Nugget Falls.
[18:13.930 --> 18:14.570]  Sounds like bullshit.
[18:15.190 --> 18:17.970]  I was headed that way because I thought it was Niagara and then I found Niagara.
[18:19.610 --> 18:21.650]  I just thought someone else would take it.
[18:21.710 --> 18:22.350]  It was so far away.
[18:23.830 --> 18:24.650]  Oh, fuck that.
[18:24.810 --> 18:25.890]  I was ten years old.
[18:25.950 --> 18:27.070]  I could probably figure this out.
[18:27.710 --> 18:28.110]  Uh...
[18:28.110 --> 18:28.450]  You!
[18:29.210 --> 18:30.810]  They seem like they'd be involved.
[18:32.030 --> 18:34.990]  I'm willing to bet that these...
[18:34.990 --> 18:35.210]  Yes.
[18:35.690 --> 18:36.350]  Oh, shit!
[18:36.350 --> 18:38.630]  Ah, fuck!
[18:38.890 --> 18:39.950]  You suck, Geoff!
[18:41.430 --> 18:41.910]  Shit!
[18:43.450 --> 18:44.550]  Tina Turner went?
[18:44.930 --> 18:45.250]  Wow!
[18:45.610 --> 18:45.790]  Yeah!
[18:45.970 --> 18:47.010]  I even knew that one.
[18:47.110 --> 18:47.590]  Did you?
[18:47.910 --> 18:48.910]  Thought I was being cheeky.
[18:49.230 --> 18:49.890]  But I'm not.
[18:49.910 --> 18:50.750]  I'm just stupid.
[18:52.010 --> 18:52.590]  Ooh, Geoff.
[18:52.850 --> 18:53.590]  Real well.
[18:53.710 --> 18:54.330]  Fuck, who cares?
[18:54.650 --> 18:55.270]  Oh, Geoff.
[18:55.470 --> 18:57.130]  They both suck buttholes.
[18:58.470 --> 19:00.030]  Maybe there'll be a question about butt.
[19:01.370 --> 19:01.850]  Nope.
[19:02.810 --> 19:03.670]  Christ, Ray.
[19:03.670 --> 19:04.170]  Oh, that's bad.
[19:04.170 --> 19:04.710]  You love language.
[19:04.710 --> 19:05.510]  That's bad, that's bad.
[19:05.670 --> 19:06.730]  I'm willing to bet that...
[19:06.730 --> 19:08.090]  That feels like a Viking word.
[19:08.570 --> 19:08.970]  Nope.
[19:10.470 --> 19:10.570]  Yeah.
[19:10.790 --> 19:10.890]  Eh!
[19:11.270 --> 19:11.910]  Geoff's out!
[19:12.010 --> 19:12.950]  I don't know why I did that.
[19:13.110 --> 19:14.270]  I don't know why I did that.
[19:14.350 --> 19:15.010]  Why did I do that?
[19:15.610 --> 19:16.070]  This one.
[19:16.390 --> 19:16.590]  Yeah.
[19:21.450 --> 19:21.850]  Eh!
[19:22.370 --> 19:23.050]  Geoff's wrong!
[19:24.110 --> 19:28.570]  I was going mainly for single syllable doing words.
[19:29.070 --> 19:29.430]  Heh.
[19:32.830 --> 19:35.310]  Man, the Vikings really messed up England.
[19:35.510 --> 19:36.150]  They really did.
[19:37.030 --> 19:37.290]  Yeah.
[19:37.430 --> 19:38.190]  Yeah, they did.
[19:41.890 --> 19:42.990]  What a great Assassin's Creed.
[19:42.990 --> 19:43.610]  A very successful invasion.
[19:44.350 --> 19:44.710]  No?
[19:45.090 --> 19:45.530]  You didn't let on?
[19:45.790 --> 19:45.930]  Nah, I didn't.
[19:45.950 --> 19:46.410]  I didn't play it.
[19:46.510 --> 19:47.050]  It's too big.
[19:47.790 --> 19:48.410]  Never played it.
[19:48.870 --> 19:49.370]  I have it.
[19:49.450 --> 19:49.930]  Haven't played it.
[19:51.510 --> 19:52.430]  You're not missing much.
[19:52.650 --> 19:53.810]  Oh, well, sweet.
[19:53.810 --> 19:55.290]  I've been thinking about picking up Mirage, though.
[19:55.630 --> 19:57.510]  Wish you'd told me that when I got it so I could return it.
[19:57.670 --> 19:58.950]  I liked Odyssey a lot.
[19:59.770 --> 20:01.970]  I really liked Origins.
[20:03.130 --> 20:05.270]  That was my first one, so maybe that's why.
[20:06.170 --> 20:06.890]  First one ever?
[20:07.570 --> 20:07.870]  Yeah.
[20:08.010 --> 20:08.450]  Oh, really?
[20:09.130 --> 20:09.390]  Wow.
[20:09.610 --> 20:15.350]  Because I bought Assassin's Creed 2 not knowing the plot of it, and I was really thrown off
[20:15.350 --> 20:17.750]  when it started in an elevator, or was, like, modern.
[20:18.130 --> 20:22.130]  I thought they put the wrong game on my disc, and I just couldn't get past it.
[20:22.910 --> 20:24.670]  Do you have a lot of stuff to claim to have in the mainstream?
[20:26.370 --> 20:27.090]  I mean...
[20:28.470 --> 20:30.510]  It has to be.
[20:31.050 --> 20:31.910]  Oh, no!
[20:32.110 --> 20:33.490]  Oh, my God.
[20:34.470 --> 20:35.190]  Highly contested.
[20:35.770 --> 20:36.790]  Oh, my God.
[20:37.250 --> 20:37.690]  I went there.
[20:37.690 --> 20:38.370]  Oh, it's one of them.
[20:39.130 --> 20:40.210]  Oh, my God.
[20:40.250 --> 20:41.210]  It's called the French Dip?
[20:41.310 --> 20:42.370]  What the...
[20:42.370 --> 20:44.730]  It was from a guy whose last name was French, I think.
[20:44.770 --> 20:46.050]  Oh, what a bastard.
[20:46.050 --> 20:48.130]  Oh, look at the onion man over there.
[20:49.770 --> 20:51.710]  How would that relate to sports, by the way?
[20:53.210 --> 20:55.790]  Had a habit of wearing a beret with a business suit.
[20:56.030 --> 20:58.590]  Should I know who any of these people are?
[20:59.370 --> 21:00.890]  I swear to God, okay.
[21:00.990 --> 21:01.510]  Yeah.
[21:02.010 --> 21:04.390]  No fucking clue.
[21:13.140 --> 21:16.260]  I feel like that's a gropiest move if I've ever heard it.
[21:16.520 --> 21:16.940]  Nope.
[21:17.200 --> 21:17.720]  Whoa!
[21:19.140 --> 21:20.180]  Holy crap.
[21:21.280 --> 21:22.900]  Is a German-American architect.
[21:24.820 --> 21:25.300]  Fuck.
[21:25.320 --> 21:26.280]  I'm stupid.
[21:27.260 --> 21:29.320]  Yeah, I just said...
[21:30.000 --> 21:30.480]  Hey!
[21:30.680 --> 21:31.580]  No, we're all good.
[21:31.700 --> 21:32.460]  It's called Walter.
[21:35.900 --> 21:36.920]  First director of...
[21:37.980 --> 21:38.440]  Bauhaus?
[21:38.760 --> 21:39.240]  Bauhaus?
[21:39.780 --> 21:40.820]  Oh, the directors.
[21:41.400 --> 21:41.700]  Oh.
[21:43.800 --> 21:44.280]  No!
[21:45.140 --> 21:47.000]  Walter, Walter, Walter, Walter.
[21:47.220 --> 21:48.180]  Nick with the wedge.
[21:48.420 --> 21:49.080]  Yeah, fuck.
[21:50.120 --> 21:50.600]  Goddamn.
[21:50.820 --> 21:52.880]  Oh, I think I needed that one to have a chance.
[21:52.880 --> 21:54.320]  But Gavin has such good lead.
[21:56.180 --> 21:57.960]  He's only one away, that son of a bitch.
[21:58.040 --> 21:58.760]  Oh, that's some bullshit.
[22:00.420 --> 22:01.620]  No wedge for Gavin.
[22:02.720 --> 22:02.740]  Shit.
[22:02.740 --> 22:03.860]  He's going to do well on geography.
[22:04.620 --> 22:05.960]  Oh, fuck off.
[22:06.280 --> 22:08.160]  Oh, get out of here, you Ivy League prick.
[22:12.210 --> 22:13.390]  I missed the button.
[22:16.610 --> 22:20.570]  I just thought I'd pressed it, but I haven't.
[22:20.830 --> 22:22.690]  Oh, I actually don't know this one.
[22:23.150 --> 22:26.410]  Oh, no, Gavin got to go back into the game, because we all are dumb.
[22:28.050 --> 22:28.490]  No.
[22:29.150 --> 22:30.110]  Oh, come on.
[22:30.370 --> 22:32.290]  We had our out, and we all blew it.
[22:34.170 --> 22:36.030]  Oh, no, it's going to be all the...
[22:36.670 --> 22:37.930]  We had a chance to stop.
[22:37.930 --> 22:39.670]  That's where Gavin's from.
[22:41.150 --> 22:42.030]  Oh, fuck.
[22:42.290 --> 22:43.070]  Is located a message?
[22:45.510 --> 22:46.690]  All right, well.
[22:49.750 --> 22:50.810]  That'd be hard to mess up.
[22:50.890 --> 22:51.230]  What?
[22:51.230 --> 22:51.770]  Andrew.
[22:52.650 --> 22:54.630]  I was taking a swing.
[22:54.830 --> 22:55.150]  Andrew.
[22:55.290 --> 22:56.750]  No, I was taking a swing.
[22:57.030 --> 22:57.210]  Andrew.
[22:57.630 --> 23:00.270]  That was a calculated, huge gamble.
[23:00.550 --> 23:03.530]  You let go of the bat, Andrew.
[23:04.090 --> 23:05.550]  No, I took a swing.
[23:05.930 --> 23:08.190]  You hit a kid in the stands with the bat.
[23:08.250 --> 23:08.710]  With the bat.
[23:08.710 --> 23:11.370]  Why would it be Oxford four times in a row?
[23:11.470 --> 23:12.070]  There's two.
[23:12.270 --> 23:17.030]  Why would it be in a country that has never been founded for another 700 years?
[23:17.430 --> 23:19.170]  Because I'm taking a swing.
[23:22.690 --> 23:24.290]  What a stupid game.
[23:26.030 --> 23:27.050]  Well, they found the new world.
[23:27.390 --> 23:29.270]  Does this place called Harvard already here?
[23:29.790 --> 23:30.330]  Look at Geoff.
[23:30.830 --> 23:31.530]  Look at Geoff.
[23:32.190 --> 23:32.610]  He's angry.
[23:35.950 --> 23:37.110]  I won by points.
[23:37.130 --> 23:37.910]  We gotta do a rematch.
[23:37.990 --> 23:39.830]  We gotta obviously reset the board.
[23:40.750 --> 23:41.270]  Do another one.
[23:41.290 --> 23:42.210]  All right, fresh start.
[23:42.970 --> 23:43.770]  Fresh start.
[23:43.770 --> 23:44.630]  Oh, I got third place.
[23:44.830 --> 23:45.610]  I got third place.
[23:46.230 --> 23:47.090]  How did you get third?
[23:47.090 --> 23:47.990]  Oh, you had one more wedge.
[23:48.110 --> 23:48.990]  That's some bullshit.
[23:48.990 --> 23:49.710]  Oh, some...
[23:49.710 --> 23:51.050]  Fuck yeah, baby.
[23:51.750 --> 23:51.810]  Fuck that.
[23:52.410 --> 23:53.790]  You suck, Andrew!
[23:54.270 --> 23:54.450]  Boo!
[23:54.450 --> 23:55.010]  You loser!
[23:55.570 --> 23:55.970]  Boo!
[23:57.950 --> 23:59.790]  Not so stupid now!
[24:02.590 --> 24:03.830]  Create a session.
[24:06.690 --> 24:09.230]  I was the only one brave enough to take a Harvard swing.
[24:10.690 --> 24:12.130]  What did you swing with?
[24:14.150 --> 24:14.710]  Chopstick.
[24:14.730 --> 24:15.190]  A lot of hope.
[24:15.610 --> 24:16.250]  All is might.
[24:18.730 --> 24:20.690]  Am I supposed to press something or am I just waiting?
[24:20.690 --> 24:21.710]  I'm sending invites.
[24:21.830 --> 24:22.710]  I'm gonna make a new game.
[24:22.810 --> 24:23.870]  I'm sending you all invites.
[24:24.470 --> 24:29.750]  Andrew's like, I was the only one brave enough to be blatantly and so obviously wrong.
[24:31.410 --> 24:32.850]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[24:33.510 --> 24:34.350]  Andrew's confident.
[24:35.130 --> 24:36.530]  Confident going into the second match.
[24:36.830 --> 24:38.830]  I've been trying to win for a while.
[24:39.490 --> 24:40.130]  This is the game.
[24:40.650 --> 24:41.970]  Nick, are you still on an old Xbox?
[24:42.510 --> 24:42.890]  Oh, yeah.
[24:43.750 --> 24:47.410]  Because what, do your Xboxes have to load Trivial Pursuit?
[24:48.750 --> 24:51.170]  Gavin, this is an original Xbox One.
[24:52.330 --> 24:53.530]  Let's get you a good one.
[24:54.630 --> 24:56.190]  Because you're the one always streaming.
[24:56.730 --> 24:57.290]  Nick and Xbox.
[24:59.230 --> 25:02.250]  I have a PS5 for whenever we do something on there.
[25:03.330 --> 25:04.450]  Yeah, let's pencil that in.
[25:06.330 --> 25:09.510]  I have a PS5 too, but I'd have to get a new fucking footstool.
[25:14.210 --> 25:16.150]  Where did you get your PS5 from, Geoff?
[25:16.570 --> 25:17.430]  Is that what you're asking?
[25:18.930 --> 25:20.970]  You know, my buddy Gav gave it to me because he loves it.
[25:21.850 --> 25:22.210]  Enjoy.
[25:23.190 --> 25:24.470]  Here, I'll send it to the Discord.
[25:25.170 --> 25:27.350]  You guys want to see where it's hanging out right now?
[25:28.190 --> 25:29.110]  I assume it's under your feet.
[25:29.110 --> 25:30.470]  Synchronizing with other players.
[25:31.610 --> 25:32.670]  Yeah, it's probably waiting for me.
[25:33.350 --> 25:34.370]  And I just don't have one.
[25:36.690 --> 25:37.770]  Geoff could send you his.
[25:38.750 --> 25:40.050]  No, he needs a footstool.
[25:41.570 --> 25:42.770]  So we're pretty clear here.
[25:42.770 --> 25:43.350]  Okay.
[25:44.710 --> 25:50.790]  I really want to do the hardest playthrough mode on The Last of Us.
[25:52.910 --> 25:55.410]  Speaking of hardest playthrough modes...
[25:56.390 --> 25:58.970]  Gavin realized that we've been playing Gears of War.
[25:59.210 --> 26:02.030]  We did a first part on Insane, thinking it was the hardest difficulty.
[26:02.410 --> 26:06.830]  Gavin learned there's a difficulty above that, so we started that today and Jesus Christ.
[26:07.410 --> 26:09.770]  There's a difficulty called Inconceivable.
[26:10.810 --> 26:12.370]  I don't know this at all.
[26:12.770 --> 26:13.750]  I have no idea.
[26:15.210 --> 26:16.090]  You got it right.
[26:17.430 --> 26:19.370]  Sweet. That was luck.
[26:22.130 --> 26:26.050]  I'm excited to watch you do The Last of Us on whatever it's hard is.
[26:26.330 --> 26:27.110]  It's called Grounded.
[26:28.890 --> 26:32.590]  I've never played the game, but the multiplayer was fucking cool.
[26:33.650 --> 26:34.630]  It's a fun game.
[26:35.370 --> 26:36.390]  The hard play was incredible.
[26:36.830 --> 26:39.190]  On the hardest difficulty, you don't have a HUD.
[26:39.450 --> 26:40.490]  You don't know what your health is.
[26:40.490 --> 26:45.390]  You know how you can see through walls and get little shadows?
[26:45.750 --> 26:47.790]  That's completely gone from the game.
[26:48.910 --> 26:50.210]  I haven't read this.
[26:50.430 --> 26:55.610]  What a waste of tea.
[26:56.650 --> 26:57.390]  Go Celtics!
[26:58.630 --> 27:02.690]  Look, it's even green for Boston, for the Celtics.
[27:07.610 --> 27:08.490]  That's my name.
[27:09.510 --> 27:11.630]  What is the highest mountain in Turkey?
[27:11.790 --> 27:12.350]  Oh, that's easy.
[27:14.510 --> 27:16.490]  Is it Bazaar Juzuzu?
[27:18.390 --> 27:19.390]  Is it Ararat?
[27:25.050 --> 27:26.130]  Bazaar Juzuzu?
[27:26.910 --> 27:27.650]  Nailed it.
[27:28.430 --> 27:29.550]  How did you all know that?
[27:30.390 --> 27:31.130]  Doesn't everybody?
[27:32.350 --> 27:33.970]  No. Clearly not.
[27:34.470 --> 27:36.010]  It was the only one I'd ever heard of.
[27:36.270 --> 27:37.270]  That's my reason.
[27:40.350 --> 27:41.730]  Ararat, dat, dat, dat.
[27:42.390 --> 27:42.870]  Pissrat?
[27:45.050 --> 27:46.050]  He's not here.
[27:46.870 --> 27:48.790]  It's also called Water Ballet?
[27:49.930 --> 27:51.110]  What the hell?
[27:51.470 --> 27:53.990]  I assume it's this?
[27:57.090 --> 27:57.830]  Oh, man.
[28:00.230 --> 28:02.070]  If it's that, I'm going to be mad.
[28:02.190 --> 28:05.170]  I think it has to be synchronized swimming because it's the most graceful.
[28:05.170 --> 28:08.030]  But also, how the hell is that a... well, I guess they're swimming.
[28:08.730 --> 28:09.790]  It's in the Olympics.
[28:10.050 --> 28:11.910]  Well, I mean, it's like dancing, isn't it?
[28:11.950 --> 28:14.210]  Since 1984. Fun fact.
[28:14.690 --> 28:16.650]  Would you describe swimming as dancing?
[28:18.430 --> 28:22.130]  How many swimming techniques would convert to dancing?
[28:22.130 --> 28:24.610]  I would describe dancing as air swimming.
[28:26.730 --> 28:27.930]  Land swimming?
[28:28.450 --> 28:29.570]  Yeah, ground swimming.
[28:30.130 --> 28:33.070]  Where does the animated TV series The Simpsons take place?
[28:38.050 --> 28:41.410]  I just recently started playing The Simpsons Road Rage.
[28:41.970 --> 28:43.470]  It's a game that I played a lot as a kid.
[28:43.990 --> 28:44.990]  I don't know if I missed that one.
[28:45.490 --> 28:48.050]  It's fun. It's Crazy Taxi, but The Simpsons.
[28:48.590 --> 28:50.410]  Do they have offspring songs?
[28:52.270 --> 28:53.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
[28:55.150 --> 28:58.370]  Yeah, but they're sung by Ralph Wiggum.
[29:01.370 --> 29:01.510]  Oh!
[29:04.710 --> 29:06.090]  I thought I was first.
[29:06.370 --> 29:08.890]  Wow! Look at this.
[29:10.630 --> 29:11.590]  And stop.
[29:11.970 --> 29:15.930]  I felt so good about being first, and I'm the only one who was not first.
[29:16.330 --> 29:18.710]  I don't know. What if the stream just randomly crashed?
[29:19.450 --> 29:20.530]  Yeah, I don't know.
[29:21.810 --> 29:23.050]  We're going through an internet tunnel.
[29:23.050 --> 29:26.130]  You don't need to sabotage the stream to show me losing.
[29:27.270 --> 29:29.490]  You're going to have plenty of opportunity for that.
[29:29.510 --> 29:31.130]  There's more to preserve our perfect scores.
[29:32.710 --> 29:33.550]  Take turns.
[29:34.270 --> 29:34.750]  Grab.
[29:36.910 --> 29:38.730]  Oh, I'm going to have to go first.
[29:40.510 --> 29:41.350]  Oh, man.
[29:42.890 --> 29:43.930]  Oh, boy.
[29:44.770 --> 29:47.750]  Have you told the chat about your idea for later, Andrew?
[29:49.070 --> 29:50.070]  What is my- Oh!
[29:50.630 --> 29:53.610]  No, there's a Twitch mode in this game.
[29:54.150 --> 29:58.230]  So the chat can join us in playing and play against us.
[29:58.590 --> 30:00.650]  But for that to happen, one of us will need to leave.
[30:00.730 --> 30:03.110]  So at some point, we'll eliminate one of you.
[30:03.530 --> 30:03.630]  No.
[30:05.610 --> 30:06.590]  Oh, shit.
[30:08.270 --> 30:09.110]  Introduced to the film.
[30:09.530 --> 30:13.350]  Oh, I've never actually seen this fucking movie.
[30:13.350 --> 30:15.550]  Oh, please let me go next. Please let me go next. Please let me go next.
[30:16.170 --> 30:17.730]  You have a kid. That's unfair.
[30:18.070 --> 30:19.610]  No, he hasn't seen it. What does he know?
[30:23.790 --> 30:25.170]  I have no fucking clue.
[30:25.630 --> 30:28.550]  This is just Nick just watching Shrek all the time.
[30:28.630 --> 30:30.410]  Not these dregs I've been left with.
[30:31.270 --> 30:32.070]  What's Brogan?
[30:33.490 --> 30:34.890]  I don't remember Brogan.
[30:36.330 --> 30:38.490]  He's an Australian dude who lives out in the sticks.
[30:39.370 --> 30:40.130]  Oh, wow.
[30:42.650 --> 30:44.790]  More than one would be in Shrek 1.
[30:45.830 --> 30:48.290]  Yeah, I thought so too. But I guess that makes sense.
[30:49.310 --> 30:50.090]  He's kind of an athlete.
[30:55.970 --> 30:59.030]  Which of these sportsmen...
[31:00.810 --> 31:01.250]  What?
[31:01.950 --> 31:02.570]  Oh, cool.
[31:06.710 --> 31:07.750]  Oh, man.
[31:09.570 --> 31:12.990]  I feel like Russia takes their skating pretty seriously.
[31:13.610 --> 31:14.490]  So does Japan.
[31:15.750 --> 31:18.730]  I'm going to go with Nathan Chen because I kind of know that name.
[31:20.070 --> 31:22.990]  Kazakhstan in on the Aegis Games?
[31:23.170 --> 31:24.090]  It's very cold there.
[31:24.890 --> 31:25.590]  Let's do it.
[31:26.270 --> 31:28.110]  You know what? It's cold as balls here.
[31:28.110 --> 31:29.930]  Let's see who chose best.
[31:32.610 --> 31:38.430]  I just put together at the very end, there's two from Japan, which to me implies that Japan is very good at this.
[31:38.510 --> 31:40.150]  That's a good realization.
[31:41.430 --> 31:42.670]  Thanks for calling it out now.
[31:43.510 --> 31:45.190]  Yeah, you're welcome. Next time it shows up.
[31:46.530 --> 31:46.930]  Harvard!
[31:48.770 --> 31:49.650]  Oh, shit.
[31:50.990 --> 31:53.950]  Which of these ancient American civilizations came first?
[31:55.630 --> 31:56.070]  Yeah.
[31:59.050 --> 31:59.910]  Don't you dare.
[32:01.270 --> 32:02.490]  Don't you dare take the...
[32:02.490 --> 32:02.850]  No!
[32:04.130 --> 32:05.830]  You're looking for a place to go, Nick.
[32:06.130 --> 32:07.090]  I haven't heard of this.
[32:07.810 --> 32:08.590]  You should pick it then.
[32:09.950 --> 32:11.490]  I don't remember his...
[32:11.990 --> 32:15.090]  I'm not going to go with that one because Geoff says...
[32:15.090 --> 32:17.710]  Oh, wait, is Geoff smart? I think Geoff's smart this game.
[32:18.530 --> 32:20.070]  I think Geoff is smart this game.
[32:20.710 --> 32:22.010]  Hell yeah, he is!
[32:22.470 --> 32:23.430]  Geoff's a genius.
[32:25.630 --> 32:26.610]  Thanks, Geoff.
[32:26.610 --> 32:27.810]  Damn it, Geoff.
[32:28.030 --> 32:29.610]  I wish I had picked it for myself.
[32:33.450 --> 32:36.230]  I realized later, I'd never heard of it.
[32:36.990 --> 32:38.130]  Which means it must be very old.
[32:38.950 --> 32:41.950]  I think people always underestimate how recent Aztec is.
[32:42.170 --> 32:42.710]  I think so.
[32:47.650 --> 32:48.730]  Oxford is older.
[32:49.510 --> 32:50.210]  Man...
[32:53.690 --> 32:58.750]  Geoff is currently recreating Old Man with PS5, I believe.
[32:59.030 --> 32:59.950]  As a stool.
[33:02.130 --> 33:04.650]  That is 100% what I'm doing.
[33:07.490 --> 33:10.610]  I like that it's called Sky Above Clouds 4.
[33:11.210 --> 33:11.950]  Oh, shit.
[33:13.010 --> 33:14.510]  It's the fourth iteration.
[33:14.990 --> 33:15.390]  Yeah.
[33:17.070 --> 33:19.590]  I've seen interviews with Georgia O'Keefe.
[33:20.270 --> 33:20.490]  Shit.
[33:22.910 --> 33:23.310]  No!
[33:24.670 --> 33:26.790]  I should have went with Old Man with a PS5 chair.
[33:28.330 --> 33:29.130]  Oh, Rembrandt.
[33:29.230 --> 33:32.830]  I didn't even see that Rembrandt was on there. It's like the only one I know.
[33:32.990 --> 33:35.710]  I didn't see his name at all or I would have gone with that.
[33:37.990 --> 33:38.450]  Oh, cool.
[33:38.890 --> 33:40.210]  Damn, why don't I read?
[33:40.450 --> 33:41.210]  Come on!
[33:43.230 --> 33:44.370]  Gavin's having a Geoff game.
[33:44.510 --> 33:45.470]  Now you're late.
[33:53.930 --> 33:54.490]  Monorail!
[33:55.950 --> 33:56.870]  Oh, it's me first?
[33:57.110 --> 33:57.270]  Monorail!
[33:58.250 --> 33:59.550]  Good god damn.
[34:01.030 --> 34:02.790]  I want to say...
[34:02.790 --> 34:03.670]  Oh, total...
[34:03.670 --> 34:04.670]  Oh, shit!
[34:06.990 --> 34:07.810]  Yeah, sure.
[34:11.770 --> 34:12.330]  Not...
[34:12.330 --> 34:14.510]  It was a good attempt, Geoff, to stop me.
[34:17.750 --> 34:19.970]  They have a lot...
[34:20.470 --> 34:22.070]  You would assume so.
[34:22.650 --> 34:24.430]  But I feel like they are known for train.
[34:24.810 --> 34:25.230]  Probably.
[34:26.130 --> 34:26.610]  Probably.
[34:27.630 --> 34:29.270]  I think that's going to be the worst bit.
[34:29.770 --> 34:30.790]  I lucked out there.
[34:33.550 --> 34:36.030]  It's a big mass of land.
[34:38.850 --> 34:40.110]  You were right to pick it.
[34:40.970 --> 34:42.430]  Because I would have taken it if you hadn't.
[34:43.170 --> 34:45.410]  I was definitely gearing towards Russia.
[34:48.210 --> 34:48.650]  Wow.
[34:52.310 --> 34:52.750]  Alright.
[34:52.970 --> 34:54.110]  Gavin can't win two in a row.
[34:55.290 --> 34:55.610]  I won?
[34:55.650 --> 34:56.050]  Is it?
[34:57.450 --> 34:58.330]  Interesting game.
[34:59.190 --> 35:00.190]  I'm still second.
[35:00.830 --> 35:01.810]  That has not changed.
[35:02.530 --> 35:04.110]  200 points separated us.
[35:04.130 --> 35:05.290]  Wow, this is close.
[35:06.410 --> 35:07.650]  Here comes the difference maker.
[35:08.250 --> 35:10.150]  So let's find out what happens in round three.
[35:10.310 --> 35:12.830]  Will someone stand out from the pack?
[35:12.930 --> 35:13.530]  Which one is switcheroo?
[35:13.610 --> 35:13.870]  Andrew.
[35:14.570 --> 35:15.950]  It's the one Andrew hates.
[35:15.950 --> 35:17.170]  Yeah, it's the one I hate.
[35:17.350 --> 35:20.210]  It's the one where you have to pick either or and you get bonus points if you're right.
[35:21.870 --> 35:23.350]  But I never get categories.
[35:24.090 --> 35:25.690]  It's just never entertainment on me.
[35:26.210 --> 35:27.830]  Everybody else gets entertainment or sports.
[35:30.250 --> 35:30.890]  Watch this.
[35:30.990 --> 35:31.310]  Watch this.
[35:31.330 --> 35:32.290]  This is going to be history and science.
[35:32.410 --> 35:32.710]  Watch this.
[35:34.490 --> 35:35.530]  Oh my god.
[35:35.630 --> 35:36.510]  Oh my god.
[35:36.670 --> 35:37.170]  What are you going to do?
[35:37.190 --> 35:37.970]  It's my dream.
[35:38.550 --> 35:39.590]  It's the dream scenario.
[35:41.010 --> 35:42.130]  It's the exact opposite.
[35:42.930 --> 35:44.670]  Hopefully it's a science entertainment question.
[35:44.670 --> 35:50.150]  Which of these awards presents winners with a statue of a winged woman holding aloft an atom?
[35:53.390 --> 35:55.490]  I don't actually know this.
[35:56.530 --> 35:57.810]  Okay, I do.
[35:57.970 --> 36:01.550]  I can't believe they put gene awards in the mix.
[36:02.890 --> 36:03.890]  That was a good movie.
[36:04.810 --> 36:05.790]  It was a good movie.
[36:06.790 --> 36:08.930]  It's strange to have a whole award show around it.
[36:09.550 --> 36:10.330]  Yeah, well.
[36:11.330 --> 36:12.610]  Everybody loves Rainn Wilson.
[36:13.230 --> 36:13.950]  Oh yeah.
[36:14.470 --> 36:15.290]  It's Rainn Wilson.
[36:15.370 --> 36:17.670]  Yeah, he's the gas station guy, right?
[36:17.930 --> 36:18.750]  The clerk, yeah.
[36:19.610 --> 36:20.130]  Ooh, Geoff.
[36:20.610 --> 36:22.430]  Ooh, Geoff. Geoff's favorite.
[36:23.850 --> 36:24.730]  Sports I'm okay with.
[36:25.470 --> 36:26.150]  I can live with that.
[36:26.510 --> 36:28.050]  If it's an actual sports question this time.
[36:30.330 --> 36:30.770]  What?
[36:32.390 --> 36:33.270]  The Christ.
[36:34.050 --> 36:35.170]  I actually know this.
[36:35.330 --> 36:35.730]  I do too.
[36:35.810 --> 36:36.390]  That one's actually easy.
[36:38.210 --> 36:39.770]  Geoff's getting those bonus points.
[36:41.490 --> 36:43.130]  Bonus for Geoff, please. Thank you.
[36:43.950 --> 36:46.770]  There's nothing weirder than whisking up shit with eggs in.
[36:48.790 --> 36:50.190]  I like the after.
[36:50.770 --> 36:52.010]  Are you a big whisker, Gavin?
[36:52.530 --> 36:53.870]  I used to like whisking as a kid.
[36:54.490 --> 36:55.250]  Yeah, whisking's fun.
[36:56.050 --> 36:57.050]  Did you wear gloves?
[36:57.810 --> 36:58.030]  No.
[36:59.170 --> 37:00.170]  Because it's not hot.
[37:01.630 --> 37:02.770]  You fucking baby.
[37:03.590 --> 37:05.490]  Which Polish monarch granted the Magna Carta?
[37:05.510 --> 37:06.270]  Gavin, just say it.
[37:06.730 --> 37:07.670]  Holy Grail.
[37:08.150 --> 37:09.130]  Oh shit.
[37:10.250 --> 37:11.210]  It's crazy.
[37:11.590 --> 37:12.770]  I wanna say...
[37:14.530 --> 37:15.670]  That's not it.
[37:19.430 --> 37:21.490]  Alright, well.
[37:21.710 --> 37:22.830]  It's just some guy called John.
[37:23.070 --> 37:23.290]  Alright.
[37:24.010 --> 37:25.550]  The good old King John.
[37:26.330 --> 37:28.090]  At least we're all similarly dumb.
[37:28.330 --> 37:28.470]  Yeah.
[37:29.170 --> 37:30.590]  There go my bonus points.
[37:33.590 --> 37:37.510]  I gotta stop picking names with numbers in when the thing's about being early.
[37:37.610 --> 37:38.630]  For Christ's sake, man.
[37:38.630 --> 37:39.910]  You need an OG name.
[37:41.230 --> 37:43.890]  Oh, this is Geoff written all over it.
[37:45.270 --> 37:46.850]  Which of these famous fictional...
[37:46.850 --> 37:47.050]  Oh!
[37:47.530 --> 37:47.950]  Oh.
[37:51.810 --> 37:52.650]  Uh...
[37:52.650 --> 37:53.650]  I don't...
[37:53.650 --> 37:53.990]  Wait.
[37:54.450 --> 37:54.730]  Wait.
[37:56.070 --> 37:56.970]  I don't know.
[37:58.490 --> 37:59.330]  That's not right.
[38:01.610 --> 38:02.450]  Uh...
[38:02.450 --> 38:03.210]  Andrew, go!
[38:03.790 --> 38:05.070]  Hercules Pirate!
[38:06.230 --> 38:07.050]  Yes!
[38:07.050 --> 38:07.070]  Fuck!
[38:07.590 --> 38:07.930]  Yes!
[38:08.270 --> 38:08.690]  Dammit.
[38:09.030 --> 38:09.150]  Yes!
[38:09.730 --> 38:10.010]  Woo!
[38:11.170 --> 38:11.810]  Alright.
[38:12.170 --> 38:13.130]  I told you, man.
[38:13.130 --> 38:14.690]  Geoff written all over it.
[38:15.150 --> 38:15.270]  Woo!
[38:15.690 --> 38:16.870]  This is some bullshit.
[38:17.990 --> 38:18.630]  Entertainment!
[38:18.950 --> 38:19.090]  Entertainment!
[38:19.470 --> 38:19.990]  See?
[38:20.450 --> 38:22.930]  Thank God I was a book nerd as a child.
[38:23.110 --> 38:23.370]  Okay.
[38:23.990 --> 38:25.610]  I should've booked more.
[38:26.050 --> 38:26.530]  Yeah.
[38:26.990 --> 38:29.390]  Thank God I didn't go outside and play with other kids.
[38:29.710 --> 38:29.890]  Alright.
[38:32.690 --> 38:33.330]  Ooh.
[38:33.590 --> 38:34.510]  I know this one.
[38:35.390 --> 38:35.910]  Oh.
[38:36.710 --> 38:37.410]  Oh, I...
[38:37.410 --> 38:37.570]  Nope.
[38:37.910 --> 38:38.970]  Nick, you dumbass.
[38:39.230 --> 38:41.730]  I'm doing this based off of Gavin knowing it.
[38:42.710 --> 38:45.290]  I just hit a button as soon as I saw the thing I looked at.
[38:45.410 --> 38:46.330]  I have no fucking clue.
[38:47.230 --> 38:47.630]  Shit!
[38:48.190 --> 38:49.030]  It was a...
[38:50.310 --> 38:51.690]  It was a level in Hitman Bloodbunny.
[38:52.070 --> 38:52.670]  That's right!
[38:52.710 --> 38:53.630]  Oh, fuck!
[38:55.290 --> 38:55.690]  Smart.
[38:56.450 --> 38:56.810]  Wow!
[38:57.130 --> 38:59.030]  Thank God you didn't read books as a kid, Gavin.
[38:59.790 --> 39:00.770]  Or was it Hitman 2?
[39:01.490 --> 39:02.090]  Which one was that?
[39:06.570 --> 39:07.130]  Ooh.
[39:10.570 --> 39:11.750]  Let's get it right.
[39:14.190 --> 39:14.750]  Boston!
[39:15.010 --> 39:16.270]  It's a tea ceremony.
[39:17.070 --> 39:19.610]  What the fuck is the tea... like, tea?
[39:21.530 --> 39:22.090]  Uh...
[39:22.090 --> 39:23.210]  I think this might be a trick.
[39:23.290 --> 39:24.910]  They have tea ceremonies in...
[39:25.430 --> 39:25.690]  Yeah.
[39:27.010 --> 39:27.270]  Well.
[39:27.710 --> 39:29.210]  Geoff is on fire and I don't like it.
[39:29.570 --> 39:29.670]  Geoff!
[39:30.630 --> 39:31.550]  Stop being smart.
[39:32.270 --> 39:32.570]  Sorry.
[39:33.770 --> 39:35.730]  I dug myself out of my dumb hole.
[39:36.350 --> 39:36.870]  Uh-oh.
[39:38.070 --> 39:38.670]  Oh, shit!
[39:40.390 --> 39:41.650]  I'm gonna sit this round out.
[39:42.190 --> 39:42.630]  Leaf!
[39:44.490 --> 39:45.130]  Let's see.
[39:45.210 --> 39:47.110]  Where on the moon did the first landing take place?
[39:47.210 --> 39:47.510]  The moon.
[39:49.450 --> 39:49.890]  Uh...
[39:49.890 --> 39:50.630]  That sounds right.
[39:52.330 --> 39:53.110]  Oh, that's wrong.
[39:53.830 --> 39:54.250]  Shit.
[39:57.150 --> 39:58.970]  That actually seems like something I should know.
[39:59.130 --> 39:59.410]  Yeah.
[40:01.270 --> 40:02.270]  We'll see if I do.
[40:03.170 --> 40:03.570]  Blam!
[40:03.930 --> 40:04.330]  Wow!
[40:04.890 --> 40:05.290]  Wow!
[40:07.150 --> 40:08.050]  Good job, Gavin!
[40:09.150 --> 40:10.030]  You too, Nick!
[40:10.170 --> 40:10.830]  Thanks, man!
[40:11.350 --> 40:13.650]  I wish you would have extended the sentence with,
[40:13.730 --> 40:15.590]  as we step into the sea of tranquility,
[40:15.710 --> 40:16.530]  because then I would have remembered it.
[40:16.770 --> 40:16.890]  Yeah.
[40:18.330 --> 40:19.930]  I'm pretty sure he did say...
[40:19.930 --> 40:21.110]  Well, the president said it.
[40:21.990 --> 40:23.170]  Yeah, well that wasn't the question.
[40:23.290 --> 40:23.590]  History!
[40:24.330 --> 40:27.410]  Well, I figure I have a better shot at this than arts and literature with you here.
[40:28.290 --> 40:28.770]  Which of these names?
[40:28.770 --> 40:29.150]  Never mind.
[40:31.250 --> 40:31.650]  Uh...
[40:35.250 --> 40:36.110]  That's not right.
[40:36.350 --> 40:37.330]  That might be right.
[40:37.450 --> 40:38.010]  That's not right.
[40:40.750 --> 40:42.210]  I didn't get into the...
[40:43.630 --> 40:45.350]  King George until King George VI.
[40:47.430 --> 40:48.070]  Nailed it!
[40:48.310 --> 40:48.630]  Fuck!
[40:48.910 --> 40:49.790]  Wow, that...
[40:49.790 --> 40:50.330]  What a surprise.
[40:51.090 --> 40:53.090]  Tudor was quite a bit earlier.
[40:53.090 --> 40:55.050]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:55.210 --> 40:55.610]  Sure was.
[40:57.450 --> 40:59.090]  Sixty-six percent, Gavin!
[40:59.730 --> 41:00.150]  Congratulations.
[41:00.150 --> 41:01.130]  Good job!
[41:01.750 --> 41:02.490]  Good job!
[41:03.490 --> 41:04.970]  Gavin's in his smart era.
[41:08.870 --> 41:10.610]  I don't like being fourth.
[41:12.430 --> 41:15.050]  I don't like being anything less than first.
[41:16.470 --> 41:20.910]  I've been in last place regardless of what the number says this entire game.
[41:21.190 --> 41:24.450]  I've either been last and second, or just last last.
[41:26.030 --> 41:26.530]  Alright.
[41:27.290 --> 41:28.070]  Back into it.
[41:28.070 --> 41:28.990]  I said I hated switchagories.
[41:29.090 --> 41:29.790]  Here we go, back at it.
[41:29.870 --> 41:30.270]  Back at it.
[41:30.270 --> 41:31.150]  We're out of switchagories.
[41:31.150 --> 41:32.290]  Round four.
[41:32.370 --> 41:32.750]  Here we go.
[41:32.890 --> 41:33.210]  This is fun.
[41:33.290 --> 41:33.970]  The real shit.
[41:34.310 --> 41:34.930]  It comes around.
[41:35.030 --> 41:35.370]  Here we go.
[41:35.570 --> 41:36.430]  Here we go.
[41:36.550 --> 41:37.230]  Grab bag.
[41:37.430 --> 41:37.870]  I'll take it.
[41:38.190 --> 41:38.950]  Blitz, okay.
[41:39.270 --> 41:41.350]  I'm more of a grab bag, just grab bag guy.
[41:41.490 --> 41:41.910]  Same.
[41:42.890 --> 41:44.010]  We can do some blitzing.
[41:45.850 --> 41:46.990]  Let's grab them back.
[41:47.290 --> 41:49.160]  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
[41:51.390 --> 41:51.850]  Here we go.
[41:51.850 --> 41:53.690]  Give me something that only I will know.
[41:53.750 --> 41:55.050]  Like a hockey thing?
[41:55.370 --> 41:57.450]  Well, I don't think hockey's gonna be in here.
[41:58.530 --> 41:59.430]  Maybe the Art of Hockey.
[41:59.430 --> 42:00.430]  I'm playing against Geoff.
[42:01.210 --> 42:02.890]  The Geography of Hockey.
[42:03.070 --> 42:04.850]  Could be Where's Hockey Played?
[42:05.970 --> 42:06.890]  Oh, God.
[42:07.310 --> 42:07.670]  Ooh.
[42:10.350 --> 42:11.030]  Uh...
[42:11.030 --> 42:11.750]  Ooh.
[42:12.090 --> 42:12.410]  Yeah.
[42:14.070 --> 42:14.750]  Shit!
[42:16.910 --> 42:17.590]  That's...
[42:17.590 --> 42:18.650]  I don't remember...
[42:19.890 --> 42:20.690]  Do I get to go again?
[42:20.790 --> 42:21.110]  Oh, wow.
[42:23.150 --> 42:24.430]  What the goddamn...
[42:26.210 --> 42:26.890]  Shit.
[42:27.730 --> 42:30.890]  It's like a stupid delay on hitting it.
[42:31.110 --> 42:31.610]  Stupid.
[42:33.690 --> 42:34.790]  What the hell?
[42:35.750 --> 42:36.630]  Where's my wedge?
[42:39.470 --> 42:42.050]  That was a move done to stop Geoff and that did not work.
[42:44.050 --> 42:45.210]  Oh, God.
[42:46.110 --> 42:46.890]  Oh, shit.
[42:48.770 --> 42:49.530]  That one.
[42:50.110 --> 42:50.410]  Yes!
[42:51.650 --> 42:51.930]  Shit!
[42:54.770 --> 42:55.350]  Stop!
[42:55.350 --> 42:56.770]  Goddamn you, Geoff.
[42:57.790 --> 42:58.730]  You're unstoppable.
[42:59.170 --> 43:01.510]  I'm willing to bet this one.
[43:01.930 --> 43:02.610]  Oh, I almost...
[43:02.610 --> 43:02.930]  Damn it!
[43:03.290 --> 43:05.090]  I almost died on the one Andrew just picked.
[43:05.710 --> 43:06.230]  Ho!
[43:08.890 --> 43:09.410]  Damn.
[43:09.890 --> 43:10.410]  Balls.
[43:10.810 --> 43:13.430]  These might as well just say numbers 1 to 16.
[43:13.670 --> 43:14.690]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[43:15.050 --> 43:17.090]  It's like Gavin suddenly playing Deal or No Deal.
[43:17.430 --> 43:19.030]  Oh, the Golden Footie Award.
[43:19.390 --> 43:21.850]  Oh, I know that this guy has.
[43:21.850 --> 43:23.850]  Oh, no.
[43:25.890 --> 43:26.810]  Oh, no.
[43:26.870 --> 43:29.510]  Well, I'm afraid round two will be a little more.
[43:30.630 --> 43:31.850]  Will be a little more.
[43:32.210 --> 43:32.250]  No!
[43:32.530 --> 43:33.190]  Oh, shit.
[43:34.030 --> 43:35.070]  Oh, Giggsies on there?
[43:35.350 --> 43:35.790]  Fuck!
[43:38.090 --> 43:38.650]  Why?
[43:40.250 --> 43:40.750]  Yes!
[43:40.750 --> 43:41.770]  I didn't see Giggs.
[43:42.970 --> 43:46.950]  Ryan Giggs once kicked a football into my chest.
[43:49.850 --> 43:51.330]  Did he take your lunch money?
[43:51.330 --> 43:52.550]  He has the gold hands.
[43:54.090 --> 43:54.830]  Oh, I...
[43:54.830 --> 43:55.890]  Yeah.
[43:59.430 --> 43:59.990]  Shit.
[44:00.290 --> 44:00.770]  Who's Matt?
[44:00.910 --> 44:01.250]  Fuck me.
[44:01.330 --> 44:02.750]  Oh, that is right.
[44:03.650 --> 44:05.350]  Is not, right? Or not?
[44:05.470 --> 44:05.730]  Fuck.
[44:05.930 --> 44:06.150]  Okay.
[44:07.930 --> 44:08.830]  Damn it.
[44:09.310 --> 44:10.250]  I got sniped for Klaus.
[44:11.610 --> 44:13.910]  Oh, Klaus, my favorite vampire.
[44:14.870 --> 44:15.430]  No!
[44:17.150 --> 44:18.190]  Or is he a werewolf?
[44:18.190 --> 44:21.690]  Oh, he's got an achievement for answering 30 questions correctly in the entertainment.
[44:22.550 --> 44:23.070]  Nice.
[44:23.590 --> 44:28.490]  What's the category, Andrew? What's it gonna be? What's it gonna be?
[44:28.570 --> 44:29.190]  Oh, good.
[44:29.450 --> 44:30.430]  My two favorite subjects.
[44:33.730 --> 44:35.410]  Slightly better than science.
[44:37.310 --> 44:37.810]  Slightly.
[44:38.730 --> 44:39.830]  Sometimes histories and movies.
[44:40.570 --> 44:43.090]  Oh, what the hell does...
[44:43.090 --> 44:43.530]  What?
[44:44.010 --> 44:45.410]  I don't understand the question.
[44:45.710 --> 44:46.190]  What the...
[44:47.010 --> 44:48.490]  Bill William, obviously.
[44:51.210 --> 44:52.030]  Can I get a...
[44:52.030 --> 44:52.250]  What?
[44:53.470 --> 44:54.610]  What's the question?
[44:55.370 --> 44:55.510]  Oh.
[44:56.350 --> 44:57.790]  Do you get it?
[44:58.130 --> 44:58.730]  No.
[44:58.910 --> 44:59.430]  What am I doing?
[44:59.950 --> 45:00.550]  Yes!
[45:01.490 --> 45:02.650]  What am I doing?
[45:04.110 --> 45:07.190]  You're taking the short form of a name that's actually...
[45:07.710 --> 45:08.170]  Oh, damn.
[45:09.810 --> 45:10.410]  No!
[45:11.450 --> 45:13.070]  Now, it's just gonna have a wedge advantage.
[45:13.250 --> 45:13.610]  No!
[45:16.670 --> 45:17.130]  Frigidavideepuddepudda.
[45:18.030 --> 45:18.950]  I'm down.
[45:19.230 --> 45:20.190]  I got two that round.
[45:21.070 --> 45:22.650]  I still don't know what I was doing.
[45:22.890 --> 45:24.450]  Like, it was two... both versions of the...
[45:24.450 --> 45:24.710]  What?
[45:25.030 --> 45:26.730]  It was the nickname of, like, the full name.
[45:27.430 --> 45:29.330]  This is why you don't pick shit like science and history.
[45:29.750 --> 45:31.270]  I didn't have a choice!
[45:31.970 --> 45:33.530]  That's literally my only choice!
[45:33.750 --> 45:34.430]  He really didn't.
[45:41.170 --> 45:42.970]  This is a bullshit game.
[45:42.970 --> 45:47.070]  This round is...
[45:47.510 --> 45:48.830]  You're, like, second place.
[45:48.990 --> 45:49.370]  Yeah, man.
[45:49.410 --> 45:51.530]  I've been last the whole game!
[45:53.110 --> 45:55.150]  I've never not been last this game!
[45:55.350 --> 45:57.410]  You're right, he's, like, 7,000 behind us.
[45:58.330 --> 46:00.950]  I'm having a terrible... this is a bullshit game!
[46:01.490 --> 46:02.610]  You're right, you're right, you're right.
[46:02.730 --> 46:04.210]  Oh, God, I don't...
[46:04.850 --> 46:06.710]  I don't know, I'm gonna be wrong, though.
[46:06.730 --> 46:08.670]  I'm gonna hit B and it's gonna be wrong.
[46:09.090 --> 46:10.610]  It's gonna be Gavin with the golden name.
[46:10.750 --> 46:11.590]  I'm gonna get a point!
[46:11.850 --> 46:11.930]  No!
[46:13.070 --> 46:14.710]  You golden-named motherfucker!
[46:15.270 --> 46:16.370]  You get a wedge for that.
[46:16.430 --> 46:17.370]  Wedge me up!
[46:18.290 --> 46:19.790]  Bullshit. Absolute horse shit.
[46:22.650 --> 46:24.110]  Oh, God.
[46:30.930 --> 46:32.870]  I am dumb about this shit.
[46:34.990 --> 46:36.210]  I was trying to think about...
[46:36.210 --> 46:37.790]  You're dumb about ancient horse shit?
[46:38.150 --> 46:38.550]  Yeah.
[46:39.790 --> 46:40.630]  God stuff.
[46:41.110 --> 46:42.090]  Yeah, that's gonna be that one.
[46:42.090 --> 46:46.630]  Oh, I think there's an Assassin's Creed DLC with this guy as the hidden one.
[46:49.190 --> 46:50.590]  I was thinking video games.
[46:55.330 --> 46:55.810]  What?
[46:57.830 --> 46:59.990]  I'm stupid, but I'm dumb.
[47:00.930 --> 47:01.470]  Oh, interesting.
[47:02.330 --> 47:02.510]  Yes!
[47:03.730 --> 47:05.270]  Gavin takes the lead!
[47:05.710 --> 47:07.090]  That was a guess, I'll be honest.
[47:07.890 --> 47:09.250]  Well, maybe he does, let's see.
[47:10.130 --> 47:10.350]  Oh.
[47:12.010 --> 47:12.870]  No question.
[47:13.030 --> 47:13.810]  I mean, I knew that one.
[47:15.630 --> 47:17.130]  I think we all knew that one.
[47:17.190 --> 47:17.970]  Alright, Andrew.
[47:18.410 --> 47:19.750]  Hercules, Hercules, Hercules.
[47:20.110 --> 47:21.330]  Snake it out from him.
[47:21.450 --> 47:21.690]  Oh.
[47:21.850 --> 47:23.890]  I mean, I'm dead with you.
[47:23.970 --> 47:26.670]  I bloody love getting nursed by nymphs.
[47:27.110 --> 47:27.490]  Uh-oh.
[47:27.690 --> 47:28.550]  Oh, shit.
[47:29.430 --> 47:29.870]  No!
[47:31.250 --> 47:31.690]  Fuck!
[47:32.050 --> 47:35.870]  God, I was a nymph, why did I pick... why did I go Egyptian as opposed to Greek?
[47:36.570 --> 47:39.670]  That was a very Greek-looking question to me.
[47:39.870 --> 47:40.090]  Yeah.
[47:40.210 --> 47:40.750]  Oh, shit.
[47:44.370 --> 47:45.390]  I'd just kill me.
[47:46.630 --> 47:46.990]  Fuck.
[47:47.790 --> 47:48.750]  Rubik's Cube?
[47:51.690 --> 47:57.850]  I read Klingon, and I forgot that marble is a ball that you can roll around.
[48:00.690 --> 48:02.930]  I was thinking of like a marble counter!
[48:07.590 --> 48:08.450]  I don't know!
[48:08.710 --> 48:09.330]  Countertops?
[48:13.070 --> 48:15.230]  His mom has such nice countertops!
[48:19.750 --> 48:21.910]  I couldn't figure out...
[48:22.610 --> 48:23.550]  God damn it!
[48:25.910 --> 48:27.430]  Well, they can both be the answer to that.
[48:27.450 --> 48:27.710]  Yeah!
[48:30.030 --> 48:31.790]  What other games is a Rubik's Cube in?
[48:31.950 --> 48:33.510]  You ever played Rubik's Dodge?
[48:34.170 --> 48:37.130]  You run, and then I throw a Rubik's Cube at you, and you try to dodge it.
[48:38.710 --> 48:40.270]  Oh, what are we filming that video for?
[48:40.410 --> 48:40.810]  No!
[48:43.370 --> 48:44.090]  Wedge me up!
[48:44.090 --> 48:45.270]  God damn it!
[48:45.450 --> 48:46.130]  This sucks!
[48:47.770 --> 48:49.350]  This is Gavin's days.
[48:49.530 --> 48:50.750]  I'd say this is his smart era.
[48:51.170 --> 48:55.270]  Well, I would do the losing thing for Achievement Hunter, but this is a new thing, so...
[48:55.830 --> 48:56.630]  Oh, okay.
[48:57.090 --> 48:57.450]  Gotcha.
[48:57.630 --> 48:58.730]  This is a new character you're playing.
[48:58.970 --> 48:59.550]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:59.970 --> 49:00.830]  Am I not last?
[49:01.990 --> 49:02.970]  I might not be last!
[49:03.170 --> 49:04.490]  I'm gonna be pissed if you aren't.
[49:05.210 --> 49:06.390]  I think I might be third!
[49:06.710 --> 49:07.010]  No.
[49:07.770 --> 49:08.270]  Show it!
[49:08.290 --> 49:09.210]  I'm a wedge warrior.
[49:09.730 --> 49:11.190]  Collecting 30 wedges.
[49:12.210 --> 49:12.850]  I'm third!
[49:14.150 --> 49:14.890]  Wait, what?
[49:15.190 --> 49:15.770]  Nick's last!
[49:17.870 --> 49:19.590]  The countertop got him!
[49:19.750 --> 49:20.730]  Well done!
[49:21.470 --> 49:24.450]  Nick, you fucking... that sucks for you, man.
[49:24.530 --> 49:25.990]  This next game is serious.
[49:26.350 --> 49:30.570]  Whoever comes in last outside of Nick is eliminated, because Nick is streaming, so it's me.
[49:31.330 --> 49:32.270]  Oh, it's gotta be Nick.
[49:32.350 --> 49:32.810]  He's gotta play.
[49:33.010 --> 49:37.430]  It has to be Nick, so between the three of us...
[49:37.430 --> 49:39.390]  Default! Default! Default!
[49:39.390 --> 49:41.710]  Maybe this is where I have an unfortunate fumble.
[49:42.410 --> 49:43.510]  I hope so.
[49:44.090 --> 49:45.630]  Hey, this is it. This is a serious game.
[49:48.270 --> 49:48.870]  Someone's getting eliminated.
[49:48.870 --> 49:50.530]  You gotta change those losing ways.
[49:52.330 --> 49:53.370]  I'm winning this one.
[49:55.010 --> 49:55.890]  I'm now...
[49:55.890 --> 49:57.130]  Gavin's probably gonna win.
[49:57.930 --> 50:00.950]  I think that was the fourth game in a row that I've won.
[50:04.890 --> 50:07.390]  If we take the contest into account.
[50:08.890 --> 50:09.910]  There's gonna be no more.
[50:10.350 --> 50:11.430]  No more. This is where it ends.
[50:11.450 --> 50:12.590]  The streak ends here.
[50:12.910 --> 50:13.170]  Now!
[50:13.170 --> 50:14.170]  Let's end the streak.
[50:16.390 --> 50:17.270]  Here we go.
[50:18.930 --> 50:19.810]  Marble countertops.
[50:21.170 --> 50:22.010]  I think we're winning on Nick.
[50:22.330 --> 50:23.250]  Oh my god, skip!
[50:24.150 --> 50:24.770]  I did skip!
[50:25.270 --> 50:25.770]  The game started.
[50:27.690 --> 50:30.430]  I'm not saying anybody in particular, just whoever wasn't doing it.
[50:30.570 --> 50:31.210]  Oh, you know what?
[50:31.910 --> 50:34.030]  I think it just loaded and it allowed me to skip.
[50:34.650 --> 50:34.850]  Yeah.
[50:35.950 --> 50:37.970]  So how about that new Xbox?
[50:38.510 --> 50:41.310]  That digit is found in the second decimal place of pi.
[50:42.410 --> 50:43.370]  The second decimal!
[50:43.830 --> 50:45.190]  No! No! No!
[50:46.690 --> 50:49.370]  Look at me not reading before I hit buttons.
[50:50.710 --> 50:51.070]  Hey!
[50:52.430 --> 50:53.150]  Fuck Gavin.
[50:53.530 --> 50:53.890]  God.
[50:55.050 --> 50:57.390]  See, this is why he's gonna win, because he reads shit.
[50:57.650 --> 51:01.350]  Oh, see, I thought Gavin was still orange, so I was like, he got it wrong, I'm orange.
[51:03.710 --> 51:05.950]  I thought I'd also got it wrong, and then I realized I was blue.
[51:07.250 --> 51:07.650]  What?
[51:08.650 --> 51:10.890]  Oh, shit.
[51:11.150 --> 51:11.330]  What?
[51:11.690 --> 51:12.310]  I didn't read these.
[51:12.450 --> 51:13.810]  Which was it created?
[51:16.330 --> 51:17.130]  Good lord.
[51:17.350 --> 51:19.070]  How many books were there?
[51:19.890 --> 51:21.570]  Wait, is this saying like the first one?
[51:21.610 --> 51:22.090]  I don't know.
[51:23.150 --> 51:24.430]  No, I think it's...
[51:24.430 --> 51:25.010]  Well, I guess.
[51:25.330 --> 51:25.750]  Oh, okay.
[51:25.890 --> 51:27.930]  I felt like if something was created, it was gonna be magic.
[51:28.410 --> 51:28.670]  Yeah.
[51:29.870 --> 51:30.650]  And a nephew.
[51:32.790 --> 51:35.130]  Not enough magician in it, too much of the nephew.
[51:35.130 --> 51:35.770]  Yeah.
[51:39.870 --> 51:42.490]  What if this is all language in the order of questions?
[51:42.890 --> 51:44.530]  Oh, for God's sake.
[51:47.230 --> 51:48.050]  Oh, dear.
[51:49.730 --> 51:50.250]  Yeah.
[51:51.090 --> 51:51.610]  Sure.
[51:52.490 --> 51:52.790]  Okay.
[51:53.090 --> 51:54.370]  How are we supposed to know?
[51:54.690 --> 51:55.410]  I don't know.
[51:57.870 --> 51:58.390]  Alright.
[52:00.030 --> 52:01.110]  Gavin and I knew.
[52:01.410 --> 52:02.570]  Oh, he was a badge of air.
[52:03.290 --> 52:04.670]  Will I score this game?
[52:05.570 --> 52:06.710]  Hobbies and food.
[52:07.310 --> 52:08.270]  He's done zero.
[52:08.310 --> 52:08.770]  That's great.
[52:09.090 --> 52:10.090]  Sports and leisure.
[52:10.410 --> 52:10.970]  Oh, shit.
[52:12.410 --> 52:13.370]  Geoff, help me.
[52:17.850 --> 52:19.270]  It's used geography.
[52:19.470 --> 52:19.870]  Oh, yeah.
[52:20.510 --> 52:22.090]  Yeah, that was pretty helpful.
[52:22.810 --> 52:23.790]  I was trying to...
[52:23.790 --> 52:25.390]  I was like, there's an Atlantic division?
[52:28.310 --> 52:29.330]  Atlantis is real?
[52:29.450 --> 52:29.930]  Yeah, right.
[52:30.690 --> 52:32.130]  I thought it was buried at sea.
[52:33.750 --> 52:34.170]  I can't see.
[52:34.250 --> 52:35.530]  Three correct in a row.
[52:36.830 --> 52:38.190]  About to make it four.
[52:43.310 --> 52:46.150]  How does someone born in New Zealand become an Australian actor?
[52:46.330 --> 52:46.690]  Right.
[52:47.630 --> 52:50.010]  Wouldn't they just be a Kiwi actor?
[52:51.090 --> 52:51.410]  In Australia?
[52:51.410 --> 52:54.070]  How does someone born in England become a Texas asshole?
[52:55.250 --> 52:56.010]  I don't know.
[52:56.150 --> 52:57.410]  I'll let you know if it ever happens.
[52:57.570 --> 52:57.850]  Hey!
[53:01.630 --> 53:02.170]  Gusteau.
[53:02.390 --> 53:04.030]  Ah, who cares?
[53:05.010 --> 53:05.550]  Eclipso.
[53:05.550 --> 53:06.390]  Whoops.
[53:08.230 --> 53:09.930]  That was one of the ones that like...
[53:09.930 --> 53:10.310]  Holy shit.
[53:10.350 --> 53:11.030]  Oh, yes.
[53:12.490 --> 53:13.230]  It's happening.
[53:14.190 --> 53:14.790]  It's happening.
[53:16.870 --> 53:17.970]  I'm five in a row.
[53:18.370 --> 53:20.370]  Wasn't the Santa Maria one of those three main ones?
[53:20.570 --> 53:20.730]  Yes.
[53:21.430 --> 53:21.710]  Shit.
[53:22.270 --> 53:23.570]  The Nina, the Pinta, and the...
[53:23.570 --> 53:23.750]  Yeah.
[53:23.990 --> 53:24.290]  Santa Maria.
[53:25.770 --> 53:27.930]  I feel like that's more like Resident Evil.
[53:29.410 --> 53:29.470]  What?
[53:30.590 --> 53:31.530]  The Santa Maria?
[53:31.630 --> 53:34.050]  I feel like that's in a horror movie or a game or something.
[53:34.730 --> 53:36.090]  House of the Dead, maybe?
[53:37.690 --> 53:38.410]  Uwe Boll?
[53:39.330 --> 53:39.690]  Film?
[53:40.430 --> 53:41.890]  I think their book is called The Santa Maria.
[53:42.050 --> 53:43.770]  I haven't thought about that dude in a long time.
[53:44.230 --> 53:44.590]  Postal?
[53:44.690 --> 53:45.070]  He's up to.
[53:47.950 --> 53:48.670]  Oh, great.
[53:48.730 --> 53:49.230]  My two faves.
[53:53.070 --> 53:54.270]  You will pick one.
[53:58.450 --> 53:59.190]  Oh, shit.
[53:59.290 --> 54:00.650]  Oh, for God's sake.
[54:01.050 --> 54:01.270]  What the hell?
[54:03.850 --> 54:04.210]  Well...
[54:04.210 --> 54:06.210]  Oh, we have to watch each other do this, too?
[54:06.310 --> 54:07.110]  That's really...
[54:07.110 --> 54:08.290]  One at a time.
[54:09.250 --> 54:12.030]  I'm just going to go for Swedish names.
[54:12.590 --> 54:13.670]  And Geoff is now eliminated.
[54:13.870 --> 54:14.690]  Thank you, Gavin.
[54:15.470 --> 54:16.250]  Yeah, no problem.
[54:18.250 --> 54:19.350]  I mean, this feels...
[54:20.510 --> 54:22.230]  Cat feels like it has to be.
[54:22.790 --> 54:23.370]  Alright, Geoff.
[54:24.610 --> 54:25.490]  No, he's out.
[54:25.830 --> 54:27.150]  Oh, you're just done?
[54:27.470 --> 54:28.050]  Oh, no.
[54:29.170 --> 54:30.310]  Oh, poor Geoff.
[54:30.450 --> 54:32.130]  No, that was for real.
[54:36.630 --> 54:38.070]  Don't you dare take the one out.
[54:39.030 --> 54:39.430]  Wow.
[54:39.650 --> 54:40.410]  I want those two dots.
[54:41.330 --> 54:42.470]  I want those two dots.
[54:42.510 --> 54:43.510]  I feel like it's too obvious.
[54:43.770 --> 54:43.850]  Yep.
[54:43.970 --> 54:44.130]  No!
[54:44.930 --> 54:45.610]  It's too obvious.
[54:45.750 --> 54:47.090]  That's a frickin' umlaut.
[54:47.510 --> 54:48.530]  Yeah, it's German, man.
[54:49.110 --> 54:49.310]  You fool!
[54:49.310 --> 54:52.050]  Well, I got the success off the dots last time.
[54:53.230 --> 54:54.210]  I'm going to go for Sons.
[54:57.110 --> 55:01.390]  Alright, well, this is kind of fucked, isn't it?
[55:02.090 --> 55:02.310]  Yeah.
[55:02.690 --> 55:03.090]  Whoa!
[55:04.570 --> 55:05.370]  Holy shit.
[55:06.250 --> 55:08.490]  Better be lucky than good sometimes.
[55:10.250 --> 55:12.890]  These all look pretty damn Deutsch.
[55:13.930 --> 55:15.030]  Walder Frey.
[55:20.370 --> 55:21.170]  Damn.
[55:21.930 --> 55:22.550]  Carl Bildt.
[55:29.390 --> 55:29.750]  Okay.
[55:35.890 --> 55:36.990]  Oh, dear.
[55:37.770 --> 55:38.570]  Nice.
[55:40.890 --> 55:42.010]  Oh, let me go.
[55:42.290 --> 55:42.610]  Damn.
[55:43.190 --> 55:43.570]  No!
[55:43.790 --> 55:43.950]  No!
[55:46.150 --> 55:47.110]  Oh, don't...
[55:47.110 --> 55:51.070]  I feel good about...
[55:51.070 --> 55:52.430]  No, I don't.
[55:53.910 --> 55:56.050]  Oh, I feel good about it now.
[55:57.510 --> 56:00.150]  I don't feel confident about my next pick.
[56:03.780 --> 56:05.420]  There's two I feel really good about.
[56:05.900 --> 56:06.200]  Oh, yeah?
[56:07.400 --> 56:09.000]  There's one I feel really good about.
[56:13.630 --> 56:14.110]  No!
[56:15.050 --> 56:15.870]  Now I'm in trouble.
[56:16.250 --> 56:17.490]  Yeah, this is bad.
[56:17.650 --> 56:18.330]  Real bad.
[56:18.430 --> 56:19.290]  Well, it's not bad-y.
[56:24.410 --> 56:25.630]  Only two left.
[56:25.750 --> 56:25.890]  Fuck.
[56:25.950 --> 56:26.270]  Belgium.
[56:27.150 --> 56:27.590]  Belgium.
[56:29.510 --> 56:29.950]  Yankees.
[56:31.290 --> 56:32.610]  It's going to be...
[56:32.610 --> 56:33.890]  Is that the tour guide's name?
[56:34.210 --> 56:34.430]  Yeah.
[56:34.690 --> 56:35.390]  Yankees, remember?
[56:35.930 --> 56:36.190]  Yeah.
[56:36.190 --> 56:36.630]  He's our tour guide.
[56:36.630 --> 56:37.290]  Oh, no!
[56:38.010 --> 56:39.990]  He took us to all the cool stuff in Antwerpen.
[56:41.010 --> 56:41.450]  Geoff.
[56:43.790 --> 56:45.490]  I don't remember a lot about that, Geoff.
[56:53.450 --> 56:53.950]  Germany.
[56:56.330 --> 56:57.110]  Oh, what?
[56:57.230 --> 56:57.670]  What happened?
[56:58.430 --> 56:59.930]  I just went with the closest one.
[57:00.270 --> 57:00.730]  And was wrong.
[57:01.630 --> 57:01.790]  Shit.
[57:02.810 --> 57:03.930]  Oh, okay.
[57:04.270 --> 57:04.650]  No idea.
[57:04.890 --> 57:05.370]  Oh, the top.
[57:05.530 --> 57:05.810]  Okay.
[57:06.150 --> 57:06.690]  Had no idea.
[57:06.950 --> 57:07.510]  Urkelani.
[57:10.550 --> 57:14.110]  Which of these Netflix series were first released in 2020?
[57:17.570 --> 57:19.450]  2020 would be...
[57:22.130 --> 57:23.090]  Oh, I remember.
[57:23.390 --> 57:23.730]  Okay.
[57:23.990 --> 57:24.130]  Fuck.
[57:25.290 --> 57:27.230]  Oh, shit.
[57:29.050 --> 57:30.610]  I remember that one.
[57:34.830 --> 57:35.270]  No!
[57:35.830 --> 57:36.710]  I would have picked that.
[57:36.930 --> 57:37.830]  That was the year we had Archie.
[57:38.090 --> 57:39.830]  So, I spent a lot of time watching TV.
[57:43.090 --> 57:43.830]  Bridgerton, really?
[57:44.090 --> 57:44.930]  I wish I could go again.
[57:45.450 --> 57:45.690]  Yeah.
[57:46.150 --> 57:47.970]  I thought that was an Amazon show.
[57:48.310 --> 57:49.110]  I avoided it.
[57:49.350 --> 57:50.230]  Emily and Buddy.
[57:51.050 --> 57:52.050]  What the hell is everything?
[57:52.050 --> 57:52.870]  Everything sucks.
[57:53.930 --> 57:54.530]  Guess it.
[57:55.570 --> 57:56.370]  Might be...
[57:56.370 --> 57:56.610]  Shit!
[57:58.010 --> 57:58.870]  I'll tell you what it is.
[57:58.910 --> 57:59.750]  It's the wrong answer.
[58:00.250 --> 58:01.110]  Oh, Nick is going to clean up.
[58:01.130 --> 58:02.110]  Here's Nick with the clear up.
[58:02.370 --> 58:03.150]  Uh-oh.
[58:04.470 --> 58:04.870]  Fuck.
[58:05.350 --> 58:05.610]  No!
[58:06.430 --> 58:08.430]  Alright, well, that came out a year later, it turns out.
[58:08.950 --> 58:10.750]  I thought Cobra Kai was way earlier than that.
[58:10.950 --> 58:13.090]  I thought Never Have I Ever was earlier as well.
[58:13.610 --> 58:15.710]  I thought Altered Carbon was in 2020.
[58:16.170 --> 58:16.730]  So did I.
[58:16.950 --> 58:18.090]  That was going to be my next one.
[58:18.510 --> 58:18.810]  Same.
[58:21.370 --> 58:21.770]  Poisonous.
[58:23.810 --> 58:26.890]  If it was to cats, it would probably be all of them.
[58:27.070 --> 58:27.770]  Yeah, honestly.
[58:31.370 --> 58:34.030]  Is that poisonous or is that really not poisonous?
[58:34.510 --> 58:35.350]  I think it's poisonous.
[58:35.770 --> 58:37.510]  It's the ricin stuff, isn't it?
[58:38.030 --> 58:38.670]  Oh, yeah.
[58:42.790 --> 58:43.230]  Uh...
[58:47.950 --> 58:52.490]  Foxglove sounds like an A24 film that is really well-reviewed that I'd never watch.
[58:53.110 --> 58:55.010]  My friend started a band called Foxglove.
[58:55.510 --> 58:55.770]  Really?
[58:56.230 --> 58:56.990]  That's a great name.
[58:58.430 --> 58:59.450]  Are they still around?
[58:59.730 --> 59:00.630]  What kind of music do they play?
[59:00.650 --> 59:00.990]  I don't know.
[59:01.210 --> 59:01.350]  Okay.
[59:02.210 --> 59:03.350]  I figured it'd be like Pray...
[59:03.350 --> 59:04.710]  You'd better pray if you touch it.
[59:04.830 --> 59:05.030]  Yeah.
[59:06.030 --> 59:07.430]  You're dead as dicks if you touch this plant.
[59:08.610 --> 59:09.050]  Basil.
[59:14.730 --> 59:15.090]  Hmm.
[59:15.130 --> 59:16.710]  I feel like...
[59:17.270 --> 59:17.370]  Shit!
[59:17.390 --> 59:18.790]  Oh, you just saved me.
[59:19.030 --> 59:20.390]  Watch as I fuck this up, though.
[59:23.230 --> 59:23.590]  Lilies?
[59:24.150 --> 59:24.510]  Daffodil?
[59:25.110 --> 59:25.470]  Daffodil?
[59:25.730 --> 59:26.310]  Oh, wow.
[59:27.350 --> 59:27.710]  Daffodil.
[59:27.830 --> 59:28.450]  I had no idea.
[59:29.410 --> 59:29.690]  Daffodil.
[59:29.690 --> 59:31.710]  Alright, here we go. Pick a good one. Pick a good one, Geoff.
[59:31.770 --> 59:32.610]  Here we go. Arts and literature.
[59:33.210 --> 59:33.570]  Oh, good.
[59:33.570 --> 59:35.470]  Is there any Foxglove music online, Gavin?
[59:35.730 --> 59:36.330]  I can listen to.
[59:36.510 --> 59:37.570]  I don't know. I'll talk to him.
[59:38.230 --> 59:38.750]  I'll have to look.
[59:39.130 --> 59:40.250]  Maybe they can do our intro song.
[59:40.610 --> 59:42.230]  Which of these are the folk dances?
[59:42.230 --> 59:43.210]  Foxglove!
[59:43.470 --> 59:43.630]  Oh, fuck.
[59:45.810 --> 59:46.890]  Folk dance?
[59:48.050 --> 59:49.010]  Who's to say?
[59:52.350 --> 59:53.470]  I mean...
[59:53.470 --> 59:54.230]  I mean...
[59:58.090 --> 59:58.650]  Fool.
[59:59.770 --> 01:00:00.590]  That's dangerous.
[01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.850]  I don't know.
[01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.970]  But it's a folk dance.
[01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:04.030]  Did you just guess?
[01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.430]  Yeah, total guess.
[01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:08.290]  Sod!
[01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:09.650]  Okay.
[01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:12.190]  I don't know. Okay, I don't know what folk means.
[01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:14.170]  I...
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.250]  That is a good question.
[01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:17.450]  Oh, man.
[01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:18.190]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:21.270]  I'm really sucking butt up in this game.
[01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:23.910]  Like, I don't want to tell you guys the answer.
[01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.270]  I want to help you guys out.
[01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:27.130]  Why not?
[01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.130]  You know, because I don't like you, and I don't want you to...
[01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:37.450]  I don't know what the fuck the cha-cha is.
[01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.950]  Oh, damn it!
[01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:42.510]  Real smooth?
[01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:43.570]  Didn't even see... yeah.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:45.450]  It wasn't.
[01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:54.590]  I can't believe that.
[01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.710]  Andrew and Geoff going at it.
[01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:58.310]  Alright.
[01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:59.630]  Geoff messing it up.
[01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:00.510]  Andrew going at it again.
[01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:01.430]  One left for Andrew.
[01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:06.230]  Oh, the Samba. Yeah, okay.
[01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:07.130]  It was the Samba.
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.430]  Good round!
[01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:10.170]  Why didn't you pick it?
[01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.570]  What would have been your clue to that?
[01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:17.190]  It's just, like, those are dances that derive from, like, the culture.
[01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:20.090]  Like, they're cultural expressions, not just, like, dances.
[01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:22.290]  I see.
[01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:25.530]  Yeah!
[01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:26.570]  Second place!
[01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.650]  First.
[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:31.650]  Right now, it's Geoff in the elimination position.
[01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.650]  Oh, darn.
[01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:35.790]  You don't want to play?
[01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.090]  No, I do.
[01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:38.170]  That's why I said, darn.
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.290]  That's like, you're not even listening to what I said.
[01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.970]  Did you?
[01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:48.190]  What?
[01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:50.030]  Did you listen to what you said?
[01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:51.310]  What?
[01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:51.730]  What?
[01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:53.410]  Yeah, I said, darn.
[01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:54.070]  Right.
[01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:55.310]  Because I'm in last place.
[01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:03.770]  I'm very conflicted, because I want to win, but I also feel like I'd help the audience the least.
[01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.650]  The Gilder.
[01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:05.490]  If I became one.
[01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.630]  Uh...
[01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:10.150]  I don't know.
[01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:11.550]  That feels like, uh...
[01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:12.030]  I don't know.
[01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:14.250]  That feels like they would be Gilders.
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:15.110]  Who the fuck knows?
[01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.950]  Ah, shit.
[01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.630]  Yay!
[01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:21.830]  It's great when you detect the vibe correctly.
[01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.370]  Oof, the Gilder, man, that's a vibe.
[01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.990]  I mean, from the Netherlands, it just fit.
[01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:28.790]  Mm-hmm.
[01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:29.350]  I could see it.
[01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:31.210]  That's why we all got it right. Well, most of us got it right.
[01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:33.450]  Oh!
[01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:36.310]  There's no way you know more about geography than entertainment.
[01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:38.070]  There's just no way.
[01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:39.590]  You don't work in geography.
[01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.730]  But entertainment could be books, and it's too much of a risk.
[01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:44.490]  Oh, thanks, Gav. This is perfect.
[01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:45.070]  Yeah.
[01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.630]  What?
[01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:47.270]  What?
[01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:51.630]  Well, one of those is a story. You can't fool me.
[01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:55.570]  Hey!
[01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:58.990]  I just figured it was long enough.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:02.960]  God!
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.400]  God, I was just reading up on the colors of tributaries the other day.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.000]  All right, I'll do us a solid here.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.940]  Thanks, Nick.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:14.460]  You're welcome.
[01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:19.450]  Are you just shitting me?
[01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.190]  Oh, damn.
[01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.350]  Uh...
[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.430]  Wait, I think that one...
[01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.870]  I wanna...
[01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:26.430]  Wait...
[01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.030]  Is it Olivia Colman?
[01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.510]  From Peep Show?
[01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:36.670]  Shit!
[01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:37.270]  Damn!
[01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:43.570]  I felt so strongly it was one of the two.
[01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:46.350]  I thought it was Olivia Colman. I thought I was smart.
[01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.190]  Never been smart. Never gonna be smart.
[01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.710]  Can we get a sports question now, please?
[01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:55.170]  Ah, this'll be leisure.
[01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.410]  Famous Russian tennis player, now through retirement in 2020.
[01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.950]  Oh.
[01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:01.810]  Oh.
[01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.190]  I don't think I ever put it together that she was Russian.
[01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.190]  What? Really?
[01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.710]  Yeah.
[01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:13.870]  That's such a Russian last name.
[01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:16.410]  Yeah, it checks out now.
[01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:20.050]  Sure, in hindsight, yeah.
[01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.310]  Now that I read it and said it out loud and...
[01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:24.290]  Select a category, Andrew. Do it.
[01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.830]  You won't.
[01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:28.850]  Madness.
[01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:31.290]  No, I like this. I'm trying to get the most points.
[01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:33.030]  I'm more likely to get this than science.
[01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.290]  Also, fuck you, Gavin, for picking geography.
[01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:38.690]  Featuring an artist with a thorn necklace adorned with a...
[01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:41.510]  What the...
[01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.030]  Oh, a self-portrait.
[01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:49.570]  One of them only painted triangles, so they're not doing all that.
[01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.290]  Nah, some of it's... well...
[01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:53.910]  Shit!
[01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:54.510]  Fuck!
[01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:56.590]  Good job, Nick.
[01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:57.450]  Hey, you too, man.
[01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.490]  Thanks.
[01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:00.930]  I'll be honest, I haven't heard of...
[01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.970]  No, Frida Kahlo?
[01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.390]  You haven't heard of Frida Kahlo?
[01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:04.250]  Nope.
[01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.770]  Good lord.
[01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:05.330]  Oh, wow.
[01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:07.170]  I'm not cultured.
[01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:08.450]  There's a movie.
[01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:10.590]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:12.630]  Selma Hayek, right?
[01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.650]  Yeah.
[01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:14.150]  Yeah.
[01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:16.050]  Alfred Molina's in it, too.
[01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:16.490]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:19.150]  Most of these places is not the natural habitat for polar bears.
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:22.810]  Are you shitting me?
[01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:25.070]  I mean, I guess.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:28.940]  That's dumb.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:31.740]  Fuck!
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.560]  They're in the north!
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.260]  That's right!
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.100]  And that's the south!
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.700]  There's no way I would've known that.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.140]  Alright.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.700]  I'm not gonna feel bad about being dumb there.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:44.660]  Alright, here we go.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.860]  I was trying to think of backdrops of coke ads.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.980]  I was really locked in on the polar bears.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.880]  Oh, no!
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.560]  Good lord.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.040]  No, no, no.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.160]  I watched this show.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.720]  I have no idea.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:58.800]  I don't know.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.820]  I'm gonna get double points!
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:02.380]  I didn't watch this show.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.120]  Yeah!
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.060]  I watched six seasons of that show, and I can't remember the second one.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.380]  It wasn't a main character, the car.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.140]  That's how they got from point A to point B.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.800]  It wasn't Route 66 or anything.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:18.260]  Right.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.240]  No!
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:23.600]  Sweet.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.140]  Oh, seriously?
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.920]  Well, audience, I hope you're ready to fill my less-than-capable shoes.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.440]  Which queen of England was known as the Virgin Queen?
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.360]  Oh, shit!
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.380]  Shit, balls!
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.760]  Oh, no!
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.760]  There's the Virgin...
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.360]  There couldn't have been two Virgin Marys, right?
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.200]  How the fuck would I know?
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:49.920]  Shit!
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.940]  Well, we just don't know anything.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:52.700]  Oh, that's right.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.160]  She ended Tudor?
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.940]  I just read that, Nick, you fool!
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.800]  I didn't know that.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.180]  Oh, Geoff and I are both at the back.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.760]  Oh, man.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.060]  Nick in the lead!
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.220]  My lead is tenuous at best.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.490]  Oh, boy.
[01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:20.930]  Okay, this is it.
[01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:22.590]  You gotta lock it in here.
[01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:28.370]  I don't even know if I could get to the range where I get two away.
[01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.470]  What's my score?
[01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:32.570]  Well, it's enough.
[01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:35.650]  Oh, right, this one, okay.
[01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:39.570]  No, there's no way I could get to 20,000.
[01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:41.310]  Andrew Panton.
[01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:42.010]  All right, Andrew.
[01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:44.090]  Sports.
[01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:47.370]  Should we be reading out the questions for people to listen?
[01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:48.350]  Oh.
[01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.470]  Sure.
[01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.830]  I guess they still can't see the answer.
[01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:55.530]  Which of these biathlon competitors won the most women's non-team events at the World Cup level?
[01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:56.230]  All right.
[01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:58.370]  Oh.
[01:07:58.590 --> 01:07:58.770]  Yeah.
[01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:00.190]  Fuck.
[01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:05.730]  Well, wow!
[01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.310]  That was big for Geoff.
[01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.030]  Choked on chode for that one.
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:13.330]  Sweden's cold.
[01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:15.610]  Oh, you know what? That checks out.
[01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:18.430]  I'll need it.
[01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:22.010]  I remember if I was the oldest.
[01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:23.050]  Oh, shit. God.
[01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:23.330]  Fuck.
[01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:24.510]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:26.090]  Oh, shit. Let me...
[01:08:26.650 --> 01:08:27.130]  Yes!
[01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:30.030]  A Methuselah rookie card!
[01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:34.590]  Simpsons reference.
[01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:35.690]  Hell yeah.
[01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:39.150]  Oh!
[01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:39.630]  Ow!
[01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.770]  They've never steered me wrong, Geoff.
[01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:46.710]  For not knowing anything at all, I'll take that. I'll take second.
[01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:48.050]  Ooh.
[01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:49.670]  They got a puzzle piece.
[01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:51.650]  I want to win.
[01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.710]  He's got three.
[01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:55.010]  Which of these British bands performed the latest?
[01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:55.850]  Oh.
[01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:59.630]  Ah! I had a head start!
[01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:01.010]  How did that happen?
[01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:02.670]  No! I had a head start!
[01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:05.590]  No! No! I don't want that one!
[01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:06.470]  What am I doing?
[01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.270]  No!
[01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.230]  I got the least...
[01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:14.310]  Oh. Oh. Okay.
[01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:18.830]  How did I lose on Coldplay? I had a head start.
[01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:21.430]  I was locked in.
[01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:24.210]  I knew it.
[01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:26.390]  I'll be honest, once Coldplay was gone there...
[01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.750]  2000!
[01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:28.710]  I know the year, even.
[01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:30.770]  Which of these minerals is the softest?
[01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.310]  Oh.
[01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:37.310]  I don't care about having a lead here, but all I get at that time goes right up.
[01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:37.870]  Talc.
[01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:38.590]  No problem.
[01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:39.370]  No!
[01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:42.510]  Talc?
[01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:43.490]  Is that mineral?
[01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:44.190]  This game sucks!
[01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:44.950]  Like talcum powder?
[01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.090]  It's a mineral?
[01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.990]  Yeah.
[01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:49.050]  You just like mine talc?
[01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:52.350]  It's also a wedge on my fucking pie, baby.
[01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:53.730]  Talc?
[01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:55.550]  Oh, great.
[01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:57.430]  History and fucking sci...
[01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:58.390]  I knew it!
[01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:00.350]  They always do this!
[01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:02.890]  Oh, fuck!
[01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:07.610]  Doesn't matter, I'm just gonna go to the top and it's gonna be wrong again, or you guys will beat me and it's right.
[01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.770]  Which of these monetary units appeared first?
[01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:11.570]  It's definitely not the top.
[01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.990]  No!
[01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.830]  No!
[01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:16.430]  Gold standard has to...
[01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.910]  Oh, wait.
[01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:20.570]  Coins?
[01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:21.070]  Okay.
[01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:24.310]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:26.110]  I got some points for that.
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:28.970]  I was blown away when everyone didn't just converge on coins.
[01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:31.450]  I did, I went right for it!
[01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:34.850]  I just felt like it would take them a while.
[01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:36.370]  Oh, Gavin, holy shit.
[01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:38.010]  Oh, man.
[01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:41.850]  My head was just like, straps of cow would be the first currency, because why not?
[01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:44.610]  You ever thought about metal yet? Coins?
[01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:47.190]  Oh, God.
[01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:50.430]  I don't even know what my score is.
[01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:53.030]  Oh, fuck me, I'm gonna sleep like a king tonight.
[01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:54.290]  Oh, it has to be entertainment.
[01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:56.470]  Dude, you...
[01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:58.210]  You should have seen the fucking...
[01:10:58.210 --> 01:10:58.670]  Oh, no!
[01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:01.150]  ...video we had to play, record earlier.
[01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.150]  I'm excited.
[01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:03.330]  Oh, no!
[01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:04.850]  It's an hour and a half of dying.
[01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.270]  Uh-oh.
[01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:07.370]  Painted the ceiling in the...
[01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.690]  Okay.
[01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:09.370]  No!
[01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:10.270]  Here's... wait.
[01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:12.770]  I'm so gun-shy.
[01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:14.630]  I'm so gun-shy right now.
[01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:15.530]  I'm on tilt.
[01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:17.450]  Come on, play has me on tilt.
[01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:19.110]  Oh, shit!
[01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.990]  How do I know that?
[01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.450]  What the hell?
[01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:22.290]  Yeah, he did.
[01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:23.830]  Oh, bye.
[01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:25.610]  Yes!
[01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:28.150]  I have my chance.
[01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:28.910]  Toss it away.
[01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.190]  I must take it from Gavin.
[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:31.910]  All you got, you throw it away.
[01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:32.950]  No.
[01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:36.410]  Okay.
[01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:37.350]  Yeah, it checks out.
[01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:39.070]  Right and wrong together.
[01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:41.270]  Dude, I'm so glad I went to Italy last year.
[01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:42.390]  Yeah, I'll bet you are.
[01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:45.810]  Oh, man.
[01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.290]  Uh-oh.
[01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:47.770]  I saw the wiener.
[01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:48.130]  I...
[01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:50.610]  ...just hit a button.
[01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:52.230]  I...
[01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:54.570]  ...panicked so hard.
[01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.710]  Yeah!
[01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:57.130]  Wait!
[01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:58.350]  Oh, no!
[01:11:58.670 --> 01:11:58.910]  No!
[01:11:59.130 --> 01:11:59.410]  Wait!
[01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:00.150]  Oh!
[01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:01.330]  I don't know my turtles!
[01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:01.870]  Ah!
[01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:03.450]  Ho!
[01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:04.430]  Ho!
[01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:05.150]  Ho!
[01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:06.010]  Ho!
[01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:07.390]  Ho!
[01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.670]  Ho!
[01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:08.710]  Ho!
[01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.830]  Ho!
[01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.530]  Ho!
[01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:14.630]  I was waiting for which one of these turtles and I was locked into Raphael.
[01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:15.590]  Oh, God.
[01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:16.090]  Oh.
[01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:16.730]  Oh, God.
[01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:17.930]  Oh, God.
[01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:19.590]  Oh, holy shit.
[01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:21.130]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.950]  Sports.
[01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:22.390]  Great.
[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:23.590]  All right, here's our shot.
[01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:25.010]  Oh, fuck.
[01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:26.870]  Oh!
[01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:29.010]  What the hell is that?
[01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.150]  Oh, God.
[01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:30.110]  Oh, shit.
[01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:31.090]  Oh, no.
[01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:32.170]  Uh...
[01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:33.310]  No, I didn't pick anything!
[01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:33.950]  No!
[01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:36.570]  Get him out, get him out, get him out.
[01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:38.050]  Fuck, he's back in!
[01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.770]  He's back in!
[01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:39.590]  He's back in!
[01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.670]  He's back in!
[01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:43.450]  That's wrong.
[01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:46.690]  Wait, oh, wait.
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:47.230]  Wait.
[01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:48.230]  Wait a second.
[01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.710]  Yes!
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.020]  As long as Gavin doesn't get a wedge.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:57.340]  Uh-oh.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.500]  Wait, what?
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:12:59.880]  You can't get a wedge.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.460]  Oh, I messed up.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.800]  Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:05.280]  Yes!
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.460]  I fucked that up.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.160]  Oh, please!
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:08.920]  Yes!
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.540]  Oh, man.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:11.880]  Where is he?
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.900]  Oh, he's Portuguese.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.500]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:18.880]  Oh, no.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.800]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:21.240]  Coin flip.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:21.920]  I don't...
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.260]  Wait, who didn't go?
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.620]  I don't think Geoff did.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.400]  Geoff didn't...
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:31.840]  I didn't!
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:32.900]  I hit Joan Crawford!
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.220]  No, he missed it.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.440]  He missed it.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:36.960]  Oh, no!
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.380]  I knew it!
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:41.680]  Whoops.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.120]  Okay.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.100]  We're wrong together.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.380]  I really just can't afford you to get a wedge.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.220]  Let's wedge it up, son.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.380]  Oh, I could be in a winning position.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.560]  This is a huge swing, potentially.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:01.860]  Yeah!
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.120]  Holy shit.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:04.540]  Wow.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.240]  I can win!
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:06.700]  I might win this!
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:07.420]  Alright, we have to...
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.060]  Andrew's going for gold!
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.780]  We can't allow this shit.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.780]  Here we go, here we go.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.780]  Oh, no!
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.860]  What did we do?
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.580]  What's close?
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.540]  1807?
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:21.660]  Oh, no!
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.560]  I didn't read the year!
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:22.840]  No!
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.600]  Why is it not working?!
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.120]  I'm hitting the fucking buttons!
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.120]  Oh, no!
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:29.840]  I'm still in it!
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:32.420]  Oh!
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:33.800]  The Harvard!
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.900]  What the fuck, man?
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:38.320]  Okay.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.640]  We're still alive.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:42.380]  Still in it.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.740]  I don't even need to be right, we just both need to be wrong.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.340]  Gavin, you just have to win this round, okay?
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:48.800]  No pressure.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:49.740]  Copenhagen!
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:56.800]  They do hot dogs that are fully bunned, I think.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:57.700]  Bunned?
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.500]  Yeah, like it's a full bun.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.460]  How the hell did you get the last one right and that one wrong?
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.960]  It all comes down to this.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.520]  Okay, sweet.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.160]  The heart of the city is...
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:10.300]  Oh!
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:13.360]  Oh, that's easy.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.120]  Copenhagen?
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:15.460]  Oh!
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.340]  No!
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.580]  Son of a bitch!
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.180]  I won!
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.720]  I didn't know Danish had the circle!
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.940]  What a win!
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:31.680]  Wow!
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.260]  And Drew wins!
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.020]  From last to first!
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.700]  That is insane.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:42.220]  I believe that means Gavin Free has to sit out the next round.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.560]  Dethroned from the spree and dethroned from the stream.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.260]  From first to worst.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.180]  You can stick around, Gavin, you can help.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.700]  I'll read the question to you.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.780]  And if you know it, you can chime in or you can just leave.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.440]  Whatever works.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.960]  No, I'll just watch.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:58.920]  Okay.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.100]  I'll just watch the stream.
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.060]  Alright, here we go!
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:04.900]  Let's see if it works.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.160]  It's gonna work.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.660]  It's gonna work.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.540]  After we shut it down and fix it.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:10.800]  Yeah.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.840]  Here we go.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.980]  If it doesn't work, it's just us playing without Gavin.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.320]  I bet I can disconnect it if I go back to the main.
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:31.100]  Probably, yeah.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.420]  I was waiting for host to sync question database.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:37.620]  Yeah, it's an original Xbox One.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.100]  Oh my god.
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.800]  It's not even an Xbox One Series X or S.
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.640]  No, it's not even like a newer gen Xbox One.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.900]  It's just... or like a later one.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.420]  It's like release...
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.700]  Like it's not an Xbox One X, I mean.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:01.520]  Oh yeah.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.260]  I can give you an Xbox One X.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.680]  Whichever one this is.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.900]  Is this working?
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.440]  That's what we're trying to figure out.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.200]  We had to wait for Nick to load.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.680]  Do you think that the audience has to skip too?
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.000]  No.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.500]  Okay, let's see.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:31.800]  There are viewers on Twitch.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.580]  Yeah.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.240]  There is a cool Twitch logo though.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.660]  Let's see.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.440]  Let's see.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.980]  Shut it down.
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.340]  Type a number.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.160]  No, they're doing it. It's happening.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.000]  Oh, they are.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.580]  Oh my god.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.700]  Oh my god.
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.360]  Oh my god.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:55.620]  Oh my god.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.360]  Oh my god.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:56.760]  Holy hell.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.980]  I just hit a button.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.050]  That was fucking like...
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.600]  Dicks, dude.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.020]  You can see...
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.080]  Can you see where everyone's going?
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:04.860]  That's crazy.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:08.880]  Oh, shit.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:09.800]  I didn't even...
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.620]  Oh, they got a lead.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.300]  Chat wins.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:13.780]  Well, they lead.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.260]  Or you lead, Gavin.
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.020]  Yeah, me and the boys.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.000]  What if Gavin wins...
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:19.880]  And the girls from chat.
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.220]  ...on a technicality?
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.840]  Alright, here we go.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.680]  Sports and leisure.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.960]  I think as long as one of us wins, Nick or Geoff, it's a win for us.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.220]  We're a team, essentially.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.340]  Okay, got that one.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.460]  Bill Gates?
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:36.880]  No!
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.940]  Chat seems pretty certain about Chamberlain.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.180]  No, no, no.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.960]  Chat, calm down.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.760]  This is awesome, dude.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:47.380]  Holy shit.
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.740]  Oh my god.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.380]  That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.460]  They're just throwing everything to Wilt.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:55.460]  Oh my god.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.300]  94%
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.140]  Into the paint.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.900]  And he just scored another 100.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.380]  Yeah, he did.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.520]  This is actually cool.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.260]  Chat's still in first place.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.800]  I'm actually genuinely worried that chat is going to have a perfect game.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:09.920]  I think they might.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.380]  How could we not?
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.040]  I want to say...
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:20.520]  The Floss.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.060]  Oh, not so fast now, chat.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:23.140]  Polka.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.360]  Well, they are behind us, too.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:24.780]  Oh shit, never mind.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:26.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:32.740]  It feels really bad when you push a one that chat didn't go to.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.740]  That 10 million people are flying into.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:36.860]  It feels like.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.040]  Do you see the names shoot in before you've voted?
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.180]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:42.680]  No.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:43.960]  I don't know.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.000]  That's a good question.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.900]  I've always hit it by the time they start going.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:50.900]  Yeah, I've never seen...
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:51.680]  Do you want me to wait?
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:52.780]  No.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.360]  Okay.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:56.000]  Are you sure?
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:56.960]  Of course he doesn't.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:01.740]  I keep hitting A to skip and it's just moving my menu around.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.220]  Oh.
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:03.760]  Oh, bloody Mary.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.560]  I think...
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.920]  I'm gonna marry one.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.440]  Okay, I got...
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:11.740]  Uh-oh.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.160]  Oh, the audience is split.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.820]  Oh, they really like Mary, too.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.740]  Yeah, she was a payback.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.820]  Did any of us go Mary, too?
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:20.100]  Because I think I fucked this up.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:20.420]  I did.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:21.700]  Based on this.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:22.660]  Okay, good.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.500]  That's the chat.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.660]  I'm the only one...
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:30.240]  Oh, no!
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:31.120]  Oh!
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.300]  Holy shit.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.000]  Hell yeah!
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.840]  Take that, all of you!
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:36.900]  Uh-oh.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.220]  That goes to a perfect score.
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:39.300]  Uh-oh.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.620]  Holy shit.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.680]  Uh-oh.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.960]  Chat, what are we doing, chat?
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.760]  Gavin, take control of the situation.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.020]  All right, here we go.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:51.540]  Oh, for...
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:51.920]  Oh, okay.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.960]  Who has released a series of albums using mathematical symbols as their title?
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.930]  I have no idea.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:06.660]  Oh.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.520]  I don't fucking know.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.400]  I don't feel good about it, but I guessed.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.740]  I mean, I bought Billy Eilish vinyl once and it didn't have a number on it.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.160]  Yeah, it's not Eilish.
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.600]  It's hard to even read any of these.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.520]  They're so fast.
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.240]  Hell yeah!
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:29.980]  That was luck.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:30.740]  All right.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:33.660]  I can't remember the last time I...
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.700]  I hate that I'm the one currently with the pressure of staying above chat.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.000]  Well...
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:40.680]  Keep your head up.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.040]  All right, chat, let's see.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:42.380]  I'm trying!
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:43.160]  All right.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.040]  Chat knows it's Sheeran, but not so much it's Mary's.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.560]  All right.
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.420]  Game on.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.160]  Here we go.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:56.760]  Skip!
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:57.380]  Close game.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.360]  Very close game.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.340]  Oh, this is terrifying.
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:01.580]  Oh!
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:06.340]  Oh, I'm waiting for players.
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.500]  Oh, this is going to be interesting.
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.040]  What is this?
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:17.120]  The audience is trying to skip.
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:22.920]  I'm just in the screen waiting for players.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.140]  Yeah, it's waiting for me.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.480]  I'm sure.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:27.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:29.600]  All right.
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:30.400]  Select category, Nick.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:30.940]  Okay.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.440]  Well, I got good news.
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.540]  Okay, come on.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.160]  Hell yeah!
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.960]  Let it be a Cowboys question or something for Nick.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.920]  Which of these soccer players has scored the most goals for the United States national team?
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.100]  For Christ's sake!
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.180]  Let me go, let me go.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:45.560]  Yes!
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.700]  Oh, wait, no.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:48.300]  Shit!
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.180]  Okay, now chat gets...
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.500]  Oh, I guess that works.
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:56.120]  Yeah.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.100]  Oh, that's clever.
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.460]  Shout out to Retro Love.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:01.620]  And...
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.160]  And...
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.680]  It's a me, Chris.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.160]  And Fraggle Rock.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.220]  And...
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:08.780]  And...
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.800]  And...
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.620]  And...
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:12.940]  Hey Bro, it's Brad.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:13.520]  Brad.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:14.300]  I can't read.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.520]  And then Andrew just gets to slide up.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.860]  That's the last one!
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.380]  I was Dempsey!
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.500]  Fucking hell!
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.900]  Yes, chat!
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:26.800]  I...
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.980]  I got a piece.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.860]  How did I hit the highest a moment ago?
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.720]  One question ago.
[01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.810]  What?
[01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:45.470]  Which of these lakes was the longest retention time?
[01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:48.130]  Referring to how long the water will remain in the lake.
[01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:49.890]  Oh, I was just reading about this.
[01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:51.230]  Were you re... no.
[01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:52.130]  No.
[01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.850]  No, I wasn't.
[01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:53.470]  Oh, okay.
[01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:56.970]  I know what I'm going for, chat.
[01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:59.090]  That's why I pulled that thing.
[01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:03.790]  Oh, there's a good split.
[01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:05.290]  They're really split.
[01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:08.350]  Phoenix went with four.
[01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:09.910]  Went with Lake Baikal.
[01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:11.830]  Capital Pun went up there.
[01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:15.790]  Dr. Sheenub wins.
[01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.930]  Did you do ruffling?
[01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:18.270]  Definitely.
[01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:19.930]  Come on, come on, come on.
[01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:21.590]  Alright, yeah, I'll take it.
[01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.850]  Ha!
[01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:24.170]  Chat, take that.
[01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:26.170]  Well, look, our pickings were slim.
[01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:28.190]  Yeah, they didn't have a lot to go with.
[01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:29.990]  No, they didn't.
[01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:30.650]  They had the two words.
[01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:33.410]  Give me that science wedge, because I love science so much.
[01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:36.290]  Uh-oh, we're just sitting here.
[01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:36.910]  Okay.
[01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:41.790]  As of 2020, which of these U.S. states has the smallest population?
[01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:42.650]  Oh, Scheisse.
[01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:45.350]  Are you going to pick?
[01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:46.870]  Oh, it's...
[01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:47.610]  Vermont's pretty small.
[01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:49.130]  Oh, no, I...
[01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:50.670]  Let me go. My name's Geoff. Let me go.
[01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:51.450]  It's the audience.
[01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:52.750]  It's the audience.
[01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:54.370]  Yes! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:57.490]  Oh, everyone's going four?
[01:24:58.130 --> 01:25:00.510]  Let me go. My name's Geoff. Let me go. I want to go...
[01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:02.170]  I thought for sure it would have been Wyoming.
[01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:04.930]  No, my name's Geoff. Let me go. I want to go.
[01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:09.210]  This is a really tough pick. Oh, nice.
[01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:10.530]  Oh, 49% to 39.
[01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:17.010]  Yes.
[01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:18.930]  You're going for 39%?
[01:25:21.170 --> 01:25:22.330]  Yeah, thanks, audience.
[01:25:22.670 --> 01:25:22.990]  Nice!
[01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:24.130]  Damn!
[01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:24.890]  Wyoming it is.
[01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:26.670]  God bless our...
[01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:27.850]  My vote meant nothing!
[01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:33.330]  Dang, Nick with another puzzle piece.
[01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.730]  Oh!
[01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:36.950]  About to put chat in last.
[01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:40.210]  Which of these books was published most recently?
[01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:45.570]  It's the audience.
[01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:47.530]  Go forth, audience.
[01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:49.170]  Recently?
[01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:52.690]  Oh.
[01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:54.330]  Whoa, it's a real shuffle.
[01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:56.850]  Yeah, my vote went where a bunch of shit didn't.
[01:26:03.130 --> 01:26:04.930]  Well, we should go first more often. Look at this.
[01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:07.050]  I'm going to go Wrinkle.
[01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:08.570]  Oh, wow.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.740]  Weep Who Was In The War, right?
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.060]  That was a war book, post-war.
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:15.940]  Wow!
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:16.940]  Oh, fuck!
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:17.580]  Yeah!
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:19.740]  Wow.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.400]  My vote went to Gruffalo.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.900]  I don't know what the fuck a Gruffalo is.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:25.980]  My son loves that book.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.220]  Gruffalo, Gruffalo, Gruffalo, Gruffalo?
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:29.980]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:35.260]  All Geoff knows about the Gruffalo now is that Nick's son loves that book.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.900]  And that he played The Incredible Hulk.
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:38.840]  Entertainment?
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.880]  You know, I'm proud of me and my chat.
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:43.900]  I think we're doing alright.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.040]  I think we can take this.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.080]  Uh-oh.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.980]  Wait, first place on TV or film most...
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:50.080]  What?
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:51.180]  Wait.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.060]  On TV or film most recently.
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.100]  Oh, most recently.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:57.780]  Wait, so is that actually...
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.380]  Who first played Superman on TV or film?
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.400]  Most recently?
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.580]  I don't understand.
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.260]  Who first played most recently?
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:05.340]  What does that mean?
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.180]  That's two competing things.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.440]  Oh, like someone came back maybe most recently?
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:11.300]  But, wait, what?
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.820]  It's just a poorly worded question.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:13.800]  It's very poorly worded.
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:17.560]  I hate that question.
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.040]  This sucks.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.380]  It's either Christopher Reeve or Henry Cavill probably, right?
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.120]  I don't know.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:28.160]  Yeah, okay.
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.720]  So it is who played most recently.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.300]  What a stupid...
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.060]  They really should delete that first.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:35.440]  Yeah.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.740]  It wouldn't be the first person to delete first.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:44.640]  Oh.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:45.780]  Oh.
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:48.760]  Who is Brandon Routh?
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.760]  He had a bullet bounce off his eyeball.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.140]  That's true.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.140]  This is the last Superman game.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.460]  The Brandon Routh Superman.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.700]  Is it Ruth or Routh?
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.520]  Was that the one with Parker Posey and Kevin Spacey in it?
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.120]  Yes.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:06.440]  Yeah.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.340]  Never saw it.
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.140]  It was okay.
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.180]  We're already at the final round?
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.480]  Holy shit.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.900]  And Kevin Spacey goes, wrong!
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.800]  Oh, right, he's his dad.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.440]  He's Uncle Ben.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:18.820]  Who?
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.740]  Or not Uncle Ben, that's Spider-Man.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.620]  Paul Kent.
[01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:30.390]  Are they just three round games?
[01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:31.910]  That's all I can say.
[01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:32.890]  Okay.
[01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:36.090]  Did you say Kevin Spacey was Kent?
[01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:38.770]  Oh, I was thinking Kevin Costner played Paul Kent.
[01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:39.170]  Uh-oh.
[01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:42.190]  Well, that was in...
[01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:43.850]  Thingy.
[01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:45.950]  That doesn't fill me with confidence.
[01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:46.970]  Man of Steel.
[01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:49.290]  Renault feels French to me.
[01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:52.810]  Cool, it looks like it feels that way to the audience, too.
[01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:55.550]  God.
[01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:56.270]  Renault.
[01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.910]  Renault.
[01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:57.710]  Renault.
[01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:00.390]  Oh, I read it like it's written.
[01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:01.370]  I'm so stupid.
[01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:07.030]  Well, 9% of the audience can go sit down with me.
[01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:09.990]  Someone in chat said Wilfred Brimley was Jonathan Kent.
[01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:16.750]  Oh, shit.
[01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:21.690]  It was actually Willard Scott who played Paul Kent.
[01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:25.290]  Wilfred Brimley was Ma Kent.
[01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:29.930]  Let's do this chat, we're nailing it.
[01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:33.910]  I don't like that we're all at the same wedge.
[01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:35.210]  Wow!
[01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:37.150]  Wow, let me back in.
[01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:39.450]  Are you serious?
[01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:40.410]  Is that right?
[01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:42.110]  I guess so.
[01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:43.710]  What?
[01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:45.310]  It's not French, is it?
[01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:50.790]  Listen, the game's had a couple of interesting questions, okay?
[01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:52.410]  They could be wrong.
[01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:54.650]  I got...
[01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:55.790]  You got issue?
[01:29:56.770 --> 01:29:57.430]  With that?
[01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:58.190]  Oh, no.
[01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:59.990]  I've been dumb for 35 years.
[01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:02.130]  I'm nervous.
[01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.610]  Okay.
[01:30:08.210 --> 01:30:08.910]  It's all on you, Geoff.
[01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:09.990]  Me in the chat.
[01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:12.690]  I mean, it has to be.
[01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:13.990]  Oh, come on, chat, let's go!
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:18.580]  RSS.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.280]  There's Phoenix.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.240]  Crab Lord.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.340]  Overly something.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.820]  Clob and...
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:28.540]  Godfather rules.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.700]  Here at 99.
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.280]  All right, here we go.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:36.240]  This is for all the wedges.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:37.520]  Alfa Romeo.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.420]  Maserati.
[01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:47.860]  Is the one name float over to French?
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.220]  Bomb time.
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:56.360]  My Maserati.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.160]  Jason Jay knows what's up.
[01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:07.690]  So we just both get a wedge, right?
[01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.990]  I think so.
[01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:10.670]  I think so.
[01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:11.230]  Cool.
[01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.330]  I'm dead.
[01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:13.630]  Yay for us, chat.
[01:31:19.150 --> 01:31:20.030]  What the...
[01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.870]  Oh.
[01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:26.250]  Wow, did it list who the smartest chat viewer was?
[01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:30.950]  Possesses pit organs over the body, serving as distance touch receptors.
[01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:33.210]  I don't fucking know.
[01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:34.130]  Oh no.
[01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:35.070]  Oh no.
[01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:38.690]  It's such a bad feeling when all the names go to the other one.
[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:43.140]  Chat's been wrong before.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.820]  It's true, we have got it wrong.
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.520]  But they've been right a lot, too.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.980]  They've been overwhelmingly right.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.500]  We got wrong on that.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:57.920]  Well, it's up to me and Geoff.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.900]  Demonstrate the ability to recognize the reference point.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:02.880]  Okay.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.860]  I mean, dolphins are super smart, right?
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:06.440]  I don't know.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.900]  Sharks are super smart, too?
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.460]  They're both smart.
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:10.280]  Well, no.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:10.920]  They're not very smart.
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.620]  Though, I've seen some pretty shark smarts...
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.140]  Pretty smart sharks in movies.
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:22.680]  Shark is smart?
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:24.460]  Shark is smart.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:25.940]  Marcus Shark.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:28.840]  Marcus Shark.
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:32.160]  Do you know if you turn a shark upside down, it goes to sleep?
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.560]  What? Oh.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.060]  Like, same as the... me?
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.900]  Message not sent. Your message is identical to one you sent for the last...
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:42.240]  But it's the same number!
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:43.960]  I can't vote!
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.760]  I can't vote for another 30 seconds because I'm typing twos!
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.240]  How is no one else getting railed by this?
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.260]  Send something else, then type it.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:32:59.780]  Poo?
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:01.540]  Two.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:02.240]  Shit!
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:07.920]  Sorry.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.620]  The other one communicates with its teeth.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.240]  Ah, shit. I'm gonna write poo again.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:14.860]  And then two again.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:15.960]  Poo two.
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:22.020]  Everyone's writing poo now.
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:24.840]  Well done.
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:29.060]  I wonder what will happen if Geoff and the audience both advance.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.520]  It'll be a tie.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.100]  Score and everything, yeah.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.440]  Sudden death.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:35.600]  I've never seen that.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.420]  1,300 people versus Geoff.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:42.220]  Here's where we switch because I don't know the answer to this one.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.520]  I do. I think. I hope.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.340]  I guess.
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:47.100]  This one's gotta be shark.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.460]  I did pick shark.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:49.380]  Yeah, as did I.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:49.700]  Okay.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:55.480]  I only know bottlenose dolphin and river dolphin or whatever.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.960]  What's the one with the squishy head?
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.240]  The squishy head?
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.560]  Like a giant pustule head.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.900]  Bless you.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:06.720]  Oh, beluga.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:09.500]  Baby beluga.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.160]  That's a whale.
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:10.760]  Geography.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.700]  It's a diva.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:16.460]  Iraq, Iran.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:19.280]  We'll cause all judges to base their decisions on Saria or Islamic law.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.140]  Oh, shit.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:20.640]  Fuck.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.960]  I'm just hoping for Geoff.
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:32.900]  You know, I've never actually been in Iraq, but I've been right to it.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.580]  Up to the door?
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:35.740]  Right to the line.
[01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:45.170]  Not a good law.
[01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:46.230]  No.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:59.280]  I hope one of the questions is, Geoff went to the line in 1996.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:02.260]  Which of these did Geoff go to the line to?
[01:35:06.450 --> 01:35:09.170]  Oh, I've been right up to the line on Iran too, actually.
[01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:13.090]  Don't ask that question, it'd be confusing.
[01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:18.350]  You didn't just stick a foot over just to be in?
[01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:21.750]  Nah, I was hanging out with the Navy SEALs that day.
[01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:22.850]  I wasn't trying to fuck around.
[01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:32.390]  Oh.
[01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:34.610]  Oh, it seems real split.
[01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:36.750]  I think most of it's going to Iraq.
[01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:39.670]  I went to Iran.
[01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:41.810]  So far away?
[01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:45.370]  Iraq dancer.
[01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:46.150]  Yeah.
[01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:47.410]  No, we won!
[01:35:47.530 --> 01:35:48.030]  We got him!
[01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:48.770]  Oh my god!
[01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.630]  Damn!
[01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:51.510]  Wow!
[01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:53.330]  Shit!
[01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.070]  It's not over yet!
[01:35:57.670 --> 01:36:01.070]  What a comeback.
[01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:02.330]  Oh, Christ.
[01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:05.990]  Oh, god!
[01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:08.990]  Well, let's...
[01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.750]  Furniture, Geoff?
[01:36:10.150 --> 01:36:10.690]  What?
[01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:15.110]  I think the worst part of this is watching how wrong you are after you pick something.
[01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:22.770]  Because based off of this, I'm very wrong.
[01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:27.930]  We've been known to all be wrong.
[01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:31.210]  You were saying, Nick?
[01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:32.750]  You are now tied for first place.
[01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:34.450]  Well, well, well, hello!
[01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:37.210]  Holy shit.
[01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:39.830]  Never felt so good to be so wrong and then right.
[01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:40.910]  Right then wrong.
[01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:41.570]  Wait, yeah.
[01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.770]  What?
[01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:48.570]  Wait, what?
[01:36:48.730 --> 01:36:49.050]  What?
[01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:50.290]  What?
[01:36:50.290 --> 01:36:50.370]  What?
[01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:56.390]  Flip a coin, my man!
[01:36:56.970 --> 01:36:58.430]  It's an easy answer.
[01:36:58.650 --> 01:37:01.490]  Think about where Rites of Spring came from, the first emo band.
[01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:04.610]  See, I think Geoff got this.
[01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:08.390]  If I didn't, I'm going to be pissed because they're wrong.
[01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:09.770]  Goodbye, Andrew.
[01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:13.090]  I...
[01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:16.510]  Oh, I'm even locked out of the Twitch chat!
[01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:18.250]  I'm in timeout!
[01:37:19.230 --> 01:37:20.630]  What are you timed out for?
[01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:21.830]  I don't know!
[01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.890]  Oh no.
[01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:25.990]  Wait.
[01:37:26.610 --> 01:37:26.970]  Oh!
[01:37:28.130 --> 01:37:29.090]  I don't know the answer.
[01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:30.290]  This is dumb, this question.
[01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:31.290]  I'm pretty sure...
[01:37:31.290 --> 01:37:32.110]  Could that be either there?
[01:37:32.610 --> 01:37:33.470]  Yeah, I think it could be.
[01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:34.950]  And I think I probably got it wrong, honestly.
[01:37:35.290 --> 01:37:37.690]  But if bold colors means more than just...
[01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:38.390]  I think it's emo.
[01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.750]  Yeah.
[01:37:42.210 --> 01:37:43.670]  Oh, everyone got it wrong now.
[01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:44.570]  Alright, so back to it.
[01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:45.830]  Because it's fucking dumb.
[01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:51.750]  It's also not how it...
[01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:52.950]  I guess that is how it's associated.
[01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.930]  Wait a minute, I just realized the connection.
[01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:55.650]  Yeah.
[01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.730]  Wow.
[01:37:59.370 --> 01:37:59.830]  Huh.
[01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.790]  What are you wowing?
[01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:05.470]  Just thinking about the question.
[01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.530]  Oh.
[01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:14.380]  I mean, aside from a couple of those...
[01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:17.490]  Finally learning to understand what his emo phase is all about.
[01:38:17.490 --> 01:38:18.090]  Yeah, really.
[01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:19.910]  Oh, it's emotional.
[01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:21.110]  Hair back out of my eyes.
[01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.990]  Okay, well...
[01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:29.670]  I mean, if you get the first one right, you should get this right.
[01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:32.430]  Very good point.
[01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:35.810]  Tell that to Lily Billy.
[01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:37.450]  The first...
[01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:39.910]  The first gothic band...
[01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:41.990]  The first goth band was London After Midnight.
[01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:44.350]  In case anybody's wondering.
[01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:45.310]  Oh, really?
[01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:46.290]  Mm-hmm.
[01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:48.890]  They popularized...
[01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:50.990]  I think their first big song was Bela Lugosi's Dead.
[01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:53.510]  Inspiration from Victorian fashion and punk style.
[01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.710]  Victoria.
[01:38:58.190 --> 01:38:58.590]  Sure.
[01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:02.310]  I wish the dumb shit I knew about music mattered more in my life.
[01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:03.030]  I mean, right now.
[01:39:03.130 --> 01:39:04.030]  I really did think...
[01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:06.850]  I really did think I was going to spend a life in and around music,
[01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:08.390]  not video games and comedy.
[01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:13.030]  I mean...
[01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:15.790]  If it's just a tie, that's lame.
[01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:17.890]  I hope there's a head-to-head final.
[01:39:18.330 --> 01:39:19.790]  I hope it's a tie so much.
[01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:24.810]  Wait!
[01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.830]  No!
[01:39:26.410 --> 01:39:27.170]  We won?
[01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.950]  No!
[01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.910]  Who won?
[01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.570]  Why are you mad?
[01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:33.230]  On my screen, it just shows that the audience won.
[01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:34.110]  Yes!
[01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:36.110]  On my screen, it shows that Geoff won.
[01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:37.410]  Are you serious?
[01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:38.050]  Wait.
[01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:39.910]  On my screen, it showed that the audience won.
[01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:41.850]  On my screen, Geoff won first.
[01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:42.710]  How the fuck did you win?
[01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.590]  It's on the screen!
[01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.510]  Bullshit!
[01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:46.390]  What the fuck?
[01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:47.450]  What?
[01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:49.390]  Man, all three of us should have won.
[01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.790]  Shout out to Jujubee.
[01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:53.610]  19,000 points.
[01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:57.150]  Congratulations, audience.
[01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:59.470]  We tied, but you won.
[01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:00.540]  On my screen...
[01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:01.710]  I don't...
[01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:07.530]  I think next time, whoever wins in chat should join as a single player.
[01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:08.210]  Whoa!
[01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:11.450]  Congratulations to Wolfblood13.
[01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:13.830]  Captain Harabek.
[01:40:14.710 --> 01:40:15.190]  Hazard321.
[01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:16.490]  Borinya.
[01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:18.690]  ShojiEconomy.
[01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:19.250]  Noodleneck.
[01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:21.810]  Those are the points I'm seeing for top Twitch viewers.
[01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:24.430]  What does your top person have in number?
[01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:26.550]  15,800 points.
[01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:30.010]  Oh, my Jujubee has 19,000 on my screen.
[01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:30.790]  Oh, weird.
[01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:32.430]  I just have Wolfblood.
[01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.530]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:34.450]  We're looking at the same...
[01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:35.150]  Should we do one more?
[01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.190]  Wanna do one last match?
[01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:37.950]  Wrap it up?
[01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:39.510]  Sure.
[01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:41.010]  Do you wanna...
[01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:41.830]  I can...
[01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:43.730]  One of us can switch out with Gavin.
[01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:48.210]  Everyone, look at what Jujubee does and just pick the opposite.
[01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.750]  Yeah.
[01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:49.290]  All right, sweet.
[01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:50.230]  Don't listen to them.
[01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:51.030]  Here we go.
[01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:52.290]  Game on.
[01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.890]  Last game.
[01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.830]  All right, here we go.
[01:40:53.970 --> 01:40:54.670]  Here we go.
[01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:56.770]  Gonna win.
[01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:58.130]  Gonna answer all the questions.
[01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:01.870]  Well, too bad, Deconator.
[01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:03.070]  I'm here.
[01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:05.870]  Oh, got an achievement out the gate.
[01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:06.330]  What did I get?
[01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:07.210]  Hunting for sport.
[01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:09.110]  Answered 30 questions.
[01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:10.750]  Oh, I just got that, too.
[01:41:16.190 --> 01:41:16.930]  All right.
[01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:18.510]  And let's play.
[01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:19.690]  Let's go.
[01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:20.710]  Let's play.
[01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:22.410]  Let's play.
[01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:23.850]  I skipped.
[01:41:24.810 --> 01:41:25.370]  Regulation.
[01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:26.030]  Regulation.
[01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:28.130]  Know it, laureate.
[01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.410]  I just got an achievement for answering 30 questions in arts and literature.
[01:41:30.570 --> 01:41:31.090]  I thought I already had that.
[01:41:31.630 --> 01:41:31.850]  Congrats, man.
[01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.870]  Regulation.
[01:41:35.610 --> 01:41:38.450]  Let them skip.
[01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:41.170]  Regulation.
[01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:43.250]  Up your butt.
[01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:44.450]  Up someone's butt.
[01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:46.510]  That dude carrying a...
[01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:49.030]  Like a...
[01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:50.670]  Like a Super Nintendo?
[01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:51.150]  What is that?
[01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.510]  Who?
[01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:53.510]  I can't see.
[01:41:53.630 --> 01:41:53.990]  The character.
[01:41:55.170 --> 01:41:55.650]  Gregory?
[01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:57.050]  I can't see the characters.
[01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.610]  Okay.
[01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:00.610]  Ah, he's got...
[01:42:00.610 --> 01:42:01.170]  Ah, what?
[01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:02.050]  Yeah, what is that?
[01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:04.210]  Like a skateboard?
[01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:05.230]  Maybe?
[01:42:05.710 --> 01:42:06.570]  No, it like had game...
[01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.910]  It had plugs on it.
[01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:08.930]  Maybe like a drone?
[01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:11.830]  Or like a...
[01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:12.670]  A rover?
[01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:13.670]  I don't know.
[01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:18.290]  Here we go.
[01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:27.010]  Alright, here we go.
[01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.850]  Here we go.
[01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:29.690]  Here we go.
[01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:30.310]  Here we go.
[01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:30.930]  Entertainment.
[01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:31.810]  Here we go.
[01:42:32.210 --> 01:42:33.550]  Oh, that's a grumpy face.
[01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:34.870]  This one's for the boys.
[01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:38.110]  Which of the famous actors was not a guest star in the TV series Friends?
[01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:42.010]  Danny DeVito, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, or Sean Penn?
[01:42:42.110 --> 01:42:43.810]  How the fuck would I know?
[01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:45.310]  I don't watch this show.
[01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:47.410]  I've definitely got it right.
[01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:49.050]  As do I.
[01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:50.750]  Far behind all these numbers.
[01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:56.510]  Were any of these people in that disc that I saw on your old desk the other day?
[01:42:56.730 --> 01:43:00.950]  Bruce Willis, Sean Penn, Series 7, Danny DeVito, Series 9 or 10?
[01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:04.350]  Did it run 10?
[01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.790]  Yeah.
[01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.470]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:07.730 --> 01:43:09.090]  Danny DeVito was a stripper.
[01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:11.350]  Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:15.430]  Looks like you all knew that one.
[01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:16.810]  Looks like we did.
[01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.890]  Yeah, thanks, game.
[01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:20.570]  Sports and leisure.
[01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:22.130]  That means leisure.
[01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:24.950]  Yep, sure does.
[01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:33.490]  I don't know.
[01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.870]  I'm going to guess that because the other ones don't seem to be.
[01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:45.330]  I mean, if you just go by chutney flavors, I feel like one is more common than the others.
[01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:48.790]  Oh, that's a good call.
[01:43:49.190 --> 01:43:50.130]  Mango lassi.
[01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:51.590]  Follow the chut.
[01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:54.930]  Those things are delicious, by the way.
[01:43:55.090 --> 01:43:57.950]  You know what they say, where the chutney goes, so goes Geoff.
[01:43:59.130 --> 01:43:59.950]  And Nick will follow.
[01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:04.130]  Yay, history.
[01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:11.170]  Which U.S. state was New Sweden, the only Swedish colony in America located?
[01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:12.610]  I love New Sweden.
[01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:14.110]  That was a New Sweden?
[01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:15.830]  Oh, Christ, I just picked something.
[01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:19.070]  I mean, I have.
[01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:22.930]  Oh, the audience seems locked in on.
[01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:24.070]  Oh, no, maybe not.
[01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.890]  It's split.
[01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:27.910]  New Amsterdam was New York, right?
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.400]  Also, York was New York.
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:36.120]  Oh, I got it right.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.360]  I didn't.
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:40.400]  Had no idea.
[01:44:44.690 --> 01:44:46.390]  Well, I think it does know it was Florida.
[01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:50.470]  Nice, 55%.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.430]  What is the capital city of Nova Scotia, a Canadian province located on the eastern seaboard?
[01:45:02.890 --> 01:45:03.690]  I ain't telling.
[01:45:04.290 --> 01:45:04.670]  God.
[01:45:05.230 --> 01:45:06.030]  I think it's this.
[01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:07.670]  I ain't saying.
[01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:11.230]  Just type it out a little.
[01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:20.510]  I did a bit part in that Beneath radio podcast thing, a scripted horror podcast.
[01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:23.070]  And I had to have a Nova Scotia accent.
[01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:25.010]  And I was like, oh, no, there was one.
[01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:27.410]  So I had to watch a bunch of YouTube videos.
[01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.870]  Can you still do it?
[01:45:29.530 --> 01:45:30.110]  Absolutely not.
[01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:30.770]  I couldn't do it then.
[01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.790]  Yay!
[01:45:36.670 --> 01:45:37.710]  That's how it's done.
[01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:40.750]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:42.850]  Oh, good.
[01:45:43.810 --> 01:45:47.670]  Oh, with the two subjects I am so adept at.
[01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:56.170]  Oh, didn't we just have a question about this?
[01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:59.130]  We did.
[01:45:59.610 --> 01:46:00.570]  We absolutely did.
[01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:03.270]  We absolutely did.
[01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.770]  That's so funny.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:12.400]  Gets real quiet by the fourth video.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:13.740]  The fourth game.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.760]  I mean, you shouted like three games worth in the first game.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:19.940]  Dude, I'm pretty.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.140]  That's why I'm fucking tired.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.520]  I laughed so hard that I almost passed out.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:27.900]  I just got so mad at myself.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.300]  I'm going to watch that clip after.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.820]  Will you share it with us?
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:38.600]  You always have those people you just can't fucking stand no matter what.
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:39.460]  They're so annoying.
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:40.980]  And then sometimes it's you.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.040]  We're only doing three rounds.
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:44.440]  I like it.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:44.820]  All right.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:46.380]  Okay.
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.720]  Pretty even Steve in here.
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:51.900]  Yeah, well, almost.
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:00.260]  Round two.
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:04.200]  Always close call, I feel like.
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.320]  I don't know why they spin the wheel.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.440]  I want frog to be an answer.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:10.880]  Is that what you're banking on?
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.040]  I'm picking frog.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:12.460]  Frog questions in round two?
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:14.220]  No matter what the question, I'm picking frog.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:15.720]  Toad's best friend.
[01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:17.420]  Who ate the cookies?
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.900]  I'm going frog or frog adjacent.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.980]  Dude, if you get science, don't pick it.
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:31.480]  What is Flippy from Star Fox?
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.580]  Phineas J fill in the blank.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:36.080]  Which of these animated series could have been released first?
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:38.740]  Hop, is that about frogs?
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:42.800]  Wait, which Grinch?
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:43.380]  Which Grinch?
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:44.560]  Oh, Christ.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:45.740]  Oh, Christ, they're panicking.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:48.640]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah.
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:50.860]  That fucked up.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:51.340]  That's bad.
[01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:56.010]  I didn't know that Illumination made Hop.
[01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.910]  What's Hop about?
[01:47:58.530 --> 01:47:58.850]  Bunnies.
[01:47:59.050 --> 01:48:02.150]  It's a Russell Brand bunny movie.
[01:48:03.090 --> 01:48:03.590]  I think.
[01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:10.570]  I think there is a time, like there's a year where three animated bunny movies came out.
[01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:12.310]  And I think that's what that one was.
[01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:13.130]  I, yeah.
[01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:16.130]  What is Binky Nelson Unpacified?
[01:48:16.450 --> 01:48:17.570]  Is it about a pacifier?
[01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:21.290]  I've never heard of Binky Nelson Unpacified.
[01:48:21.850 --> 01:48:24.210]  I wish I could have picked Hop because it was frog adjacent.
[01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:25.770]  Nick, you picked the worst.
[01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:33.630]  You literally say you're all in on frogs and you miss the first frog related thing you can do.
[01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:35.590]  Well, the viewers, the chat picked it first.
[01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.870]  Oh, OK.
[01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:37.210]  It's true.
[01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:39.530]  It's really hard for me to, I'm so far behind on my twitches.
[01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:45.210]  This is pretty easy.
[01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.810]  I mean.
[01:48:52.450 --> 01:48:53.510]  I think I'm wrong.
[01:48:55.390 --> 01:49:01.350]  I'm pretty sure it was the last.
[01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:02.590]  Alaska was the last, I'm pretty sure.
[01:49:02.690 --> 01:49:03.350]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:08.730]  Arizona might be pretty new too, honestly.
[01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:11.010]  A lot of fucked up in Washington.
[01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:17.030]  Definitely Alaska and Hawaii should be one and two, I think.
[01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.370]  That's what I'm hoping.
[01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:21.790]  Oh, sweet. Yes.
[01:49:22.210 --> 01:49:23.830]  Oh, the same year.
[01:49:25.170 --> 01:49:26.930]  Washington was like last place.
[01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:32.190]  Do you think anyone was conceived in Alaska in January and then born in Hawaii?
[01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:34.670]  Definitely.
[01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:36.350]  OK.
[01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:38.290]  In 1959?
[01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:42.530]  I have no idea.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.420]  That's just a dude.
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.260]  Yeah.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:52.920]  Trick question.
[01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:59.710]  Michael Bay.
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:09.400]  Well, chat seems pretty confident on Bay of Bengal.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.280]  Yep.
[01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:18.510]  Wow.
[01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:21.430]  Quite significantly more.
[01:50:21.810 --> 01:50:22.270]  Oh, dear.
[01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:24.310]  God, damn.
[01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:25.990]  I picked the smallest on earth.
[01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:29.650]  By a factor of a thousand compared to the others.
[01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:32.750]  I should feel like I should have to give one of my wedges back.
[01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:36.590]  Oh, my God.
[01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:41.130]  Oh, Geoff, you're first.
[01:50:44.610 --> 01:50:46.170]  Robin van Persie.
[01:50:47.070 --> 01:50:48.830]  You know what? Schneider.
[01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:52.410]  Rude.
[01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:55.030]  Rude gullet.
[01:50:55.110 --> 01:50:55.330]  Good pill it was.
[01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:57.070]  Gullet.
[01:50:57.070 --> 01:51:05.000]  Oh, it's a little more evenly split.
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.400]  Oh, it's a nice.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.600]  Well, it was.
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:12.420]  I feel like three names means you're good.
[01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:21.200]  Oh, well.
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:22.260]  Hey.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.000]  Sweet.
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.640]  Finally, a little redemption for.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:27.220]  Yay.
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.400]  Oh, wait.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:31.220]  You win.
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:33.340]  No, but we're all.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.220]  Well, we all have three puzzle pieces.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:37.360]  Chad's doing great.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.040]  I don't like you saying puzzle pieces.
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.240]  Pretty easy puzzle.
[01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:45.940]  We got some pizza slices and pizza after this.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:52.400]  Which of these works by the famous artist Anish Kapoor was the most recent?
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:54.560]  I think I have an idea.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:00.860]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:03.620]  Yeah, sure.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.540]  Did they start on the ground and work their way upwards?
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:08.580]  That's what I was wondering.
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:10.760]  Cloud.
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.420]  The future is in space and space is in the sky.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.900]  And you're in orbit, so.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:17.900]  Yeah.
[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:19.600]  That's higher than the sky.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.860]  That's above the sky.
[01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:24.900]  If you dug deep enough, do you think you'd end up in the sky?
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:26.520]  Yeah.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:26.760]  Yeah.
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:32.800]  Isn't that what happened in the Kong Godzilla movie?
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:35.080]  Yeah, the Godzilla movie.
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:37.340]  Oh, fuck.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:37.880]  Well.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.920]  Looks like they started in the sky and came down.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:43.920]  Huh.
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.500]  Fuck me.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.620]  You saved me from myself.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:48.260]  I'm all it is.
[01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:48.760]  Yeah.
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:50.280]  All right.
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:50.840]  Let's do this, Chad.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:51.760]  Final round.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.340]  Let's wrap this up.
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:54.480]  Let's get this win.
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:56.960]  I believe.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:00.020]  I think it's a laptop he's holding.
[01:53:03.630 --> 01:53:06.430]  No, it's not because that's like wheels.
[01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:07.730]  It is wheels?
[01:53:08.230 --> 01:53:09.030]  Maybe it's a Roomba.
[01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.410]  All right.
[01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:13.010]  Final round.
[01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:13.450]  Here we go.
[01:53:13.530 --> 01:53:13.950]  Here we go.
[01:53:14.130 --> 01:53:17.850]  Reminds me of one of those RC cars in Siege, but a lot bigger.
[01:53:18.850 --> 01:53:21.190]  You know, as they say, for all the Rubik's cubes.
[01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:23.270]  You think that's what it is?
[01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:24.390]  One of those little RC cars?
[01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:26.010]  It feels like it to me.
[01:53:26.230 --> 01:53:28.010]  Like the Siege one type thing.
[01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:29.170]  Marbles.
[01:53:31.050 --> 01:53:32.850]  My favorite countertop.
[01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:34.850]  Chad, let's do this.
[01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:37.090]  No ties this time.
[01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:38.350]  Let's demolish them.
[01:53:38.370 --> 01:53:39.850]  Chad is running away with this one.
[01:53:40.590 --> 01:53:41.750]  Well, this is it.
[01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:42.550]  I had to swap sides.
[01:53:43.450 --> 01:53:44.470]  Oh, God.
[01:53:44.590 --> 01:53:46.290]  I was carrying the nunchucks.
[01:53:46.290 --> 01:53:46.610]  Easy.
[01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:47.510]  Easy.
[01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:48.030]  In last place.
[01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:56.830]  I would have been wrong.
[01:53:57.710 --> 01:53:58.690]  I was playing by myself.
[01:53:59.650 --> 01:54:01.030]  Based on what Chad's thinking.
[01:54:02.210 --> 01:54:03.490]  And I trust Chad.
[01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:06.010]  For now.
[01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:08.590]  No, always.
[01:54:08.770 --> 01:54:09.070]  Okay.
[01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.750]  All right.
[01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.870]  Next question.
[01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:15.330]  Always until Chad gets it wrong.
[01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:16.690]  Which case...
[01:54:17.970 --> 01:54:18.690]  Complete flip.
[01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:23.830]  Shout out to the one guy who went over to Greg's couch.
[01:54:25.450 --> 01:54:26.010]  Oh, no!
[01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:27.390]  Atomic!
[01:54:29.050 --> 01:54:29.570]  Overlord!
[01:54:30.490 --> 01:54:31.990]  I've seen four people go over.
[01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:33.230]  There's seven.
[01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:34.090]  Eight.
[01:54:34.290 --> 01:54:34.650]  Nine.
[01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:44.990]  Here we go.
[01:54:46.590 --> 01:54:47.510]  Now, this side?
[01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:49.950]  Yeah, sure.
[01:54:50.410 --> 01:54:52.050]  I mean, that has to be.
[01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:52.890]  That's pretty easy.
[01:54:53.890 --> 01:54:54.430]  Is it?
[01:54:55.210 --> 01:54:58.130]  I mean, how fucking old do you think Tilda Swinton is?
[01:55:01.130 --> 01:55:01.890]  Ruh-roh.
[01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:12.090]  Tilda Swinton is 150 years old.
[01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:13.450]  I'm blown away at how many people.
[01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:15.990]  How much did Chad win?
[01:55:18.730 --> 01:55:19.610]  Grace Kelly!
[01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:27.530]  Oh, God, I have to pee so bad.
[01:55:28.450 --> 01:55:29.870]  You've almost made it through.
[01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.490]  I know!
[01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:34.410]  Oh, what if I piss myself on stream?
[01:55:34.410 --> 01:55:35.790]  Oh, no, stop!
[01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:37.390]  Chad is fucking destroyed.
[01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:38.010]  Keep going!
[01:55:42.190 --> 01:55:43.850]  Alright, here we go. These are the hard questions.
[01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:48.090]  Who do you think we're going to default to when we all get it?
[01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:52.470]  Princess Di!
[01:55:53.010 --> 01:55:55.190]  Now you're confused, Nick.
[01:55:57.470 --> 01:56:01.270]  So, I guess that Chad will win because they have the highest score.
[01:56:01.710 --> 01:56:02.110]  Oh.
[01:56:03.530 --> 01:56:08.750]  Well, so everybody will get a wedge, but if everyone has tied wedges, it goes to score.
[01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:12.370]  How come it was two different things in the last game?
[01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:17.830]  I don't know what happened last game, because Geoff won on my screen.
[01:56:18.190 --> 01:56:19.010]  Thank you.
[01:56:19.130 --> 01:56:19.950]  Chad won on mine.
[01:56:22.890 --> 01:56:23.970]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:27.230]  I feel like we have to go with your ruling as the person who is streaming this.
[01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.850]  Leon the Unprofessional with, oh, never mind, PhoenixEdit.
[01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:32.690]  You're the regulation stream master.
[01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.410]  Path?
[01:56:37.530 --> 01:56:39.350]  I couldn't read any of the other names.
[01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.630]  Christ.
[01:56:41.590 --> 01:56:42.550]  Pretty sure it's this.
[01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:47.010]  Oh, yeah, what am I thinking? Of course it was.
[01:56:48.130 --> 01:56:50.790]  It was the name of the course I took, for fuck's sake.
[01:56:55.970 --> 01:57:03.650]  I like this version of Slumdog Millionaire where you guess it right and then realize after the fact that you're right because of your previous connection.
[01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:07.930]  Not that your connection led you to the choice, but that you forgot your past life.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:17.140]  Isn't just this the opposite of the other question?
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.020]  It likes to do that.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:22.160]  It does.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.600]  I mean, I guess, yeah, okay.
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:34.800]  Hey, if you're hanging out doing this with us, currently kicking the shit out of us in trivia, when you're done, sign up, go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel. That'd be cool.
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:35.800]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.580]  The regulation pod.
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:42.900]  Patreon too, but like, you know, show some YouTube love.
[01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:48.750]  Or don't. We're not in charge of it.
[01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:52.390]  Hey, you live your life, but we would appreciate it.
[01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:53.010]  You do you.
[01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:53.610]  That would be nice.
[01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:53.870]  Yeah.
[01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:55.530]  Oh shit, I forgot I was playing.
[01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:56.850]  Oh no, Gavin!
[01:57:58.090 --> 01:57:59.750]  God, I almost missed that question.
[01:58:00.650 --> 01:58:04.930]  Trying to lull you into a false sense of security so Chad can further dominate.
[01:58:06.010 --> 01:58:08.550]  Should we raid Frady after this and really mess him up?
[01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:14.570]  Do you know where your gold is yet, Gavin?
[01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:17.410]  My gold is?
[01:58:17.770 --> 01:58:19.070]  Yeah, have you found your gold?
[01:58:20.110 --> 01:58:20.730]  What gold?
[01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:21.470]  What?
[01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:22.810]  You lost your gold.
[01:58:24.010 --> 01:58:24.430]  Apparently.
[01:58:27.170 --> 01:58:29.490]  You had physical gold? That's fine, never mind.
[01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:35.170]  No idea what this is about.
[01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:38.590]  Gavin at one point told me he was missing gold.
[01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:40.010]  And that was a while ago.
[01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:43.430]  And so I'm just circling back on if he found his gold.
[01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:45.710]  But I didn't expect him to break it.
[01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:46.610]  I know what you're talking about.
[01:58:46.770 --> 01:58:49.370]  It was retrieved.
[01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:50.330]  Oh!
[01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.870]  There we go.
[01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:53.190]  Oh, I can win!
[01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:54.210]  Not by me.
[01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:56.930]  I'm just trying to keep him distracted.
[01:58:57.170 --> 01:58:58.470]  I'm trying to get you out of the game.
[01:59:01.170 --> 01:59:03.170]  Is this too obvious?
[01:59:05.490 --> 01:59:06.750]  Am I a fool?
[01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:11.310]  What's an ungalati?
[01:59:13.530 --> 01:59:16.190]  It's a type of sports car.
[01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:19.030]  Is it Italian or French?
[01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:20.310]  It's French.
[01:59:21.370 --> 01:59:23.490]  Even tote ungalati is a French sports car.
[01:59:24.750 --> 01:59:26.250]  Not to be mistaken with Italian.
[01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:27.330]  Which a lot of people do.
[01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:31.410]  Oh, not reading!
[01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:32.070]  Oh, shit!
[01:59:34.290 --> 01:59:34.690]  Fuck.
[01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:36.290]  Ryan needs to loot.
[01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:37.130]  Nick, screw up.
[01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:38.830]  I don't know if I'm right.
[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:43.230]  If I were you, I would push X.
[01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:45.310]  To not die.
[01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:46.370]  Or would I push B?
[01:59:48.450 --> 01:59:49.390]  I already pushed...
[01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:50.450]  Or would I push X?
[01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:51.570]  What would you push?
[01:59:51.970 --> 01:59:52.950]  I've been trying to decide,
[01:59:53.050 --> 01:59:54.690]  because I want to start getting into shape,
[01:59:54.810 --> 01:59:58.790]  if I should do yoga or hot yoga or ungalatis.
[02:00:00.210 --> 02:00:01.390]  It's kind of on the fence.
[02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:04.450]  I do hot ungalatis, personally.
[02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:06.090]  I assume...
[02:00:06.090 --> 02:00:07.470]  I mean, I would think it'd be the other one.
[02:00:08.110 --> 02:00:10.250]  So, odd toes don't have horns?
[02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:15.830]  I mean, based off of the empirical evidence
[02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:16.990]  from the last question.
[02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:20.010]  I'm even-toed and I lack them.
[02:00:21.850 --> 02:00:23.770]  I feel my power growing.
[02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:25.730]  Wait, how...
[02:00:25.730 --> 02:00:26.990]  Geoff, what...
[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:29.390]  What? I know I hit the wrong button.
[02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:32.410]  You just picked a load of horned animals in the last question.
[02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:33.750]  I know, I hit the wrong button.
[02:00:34.050 --> 02:00:34.330]  Oh.
[02:00:34.590 --> 02:00:36.450]  That's, uh...
[02:00:39.010 --> 02:00:39.490]  Yeah.
[02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:42.190]  I'll be honest, I'm paying less than attention right now.
[02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.550]  Fuck this up, Nick.
[02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:43.310]  Fuck this up, Nick.
[02:00:43.690 --> 02:00:44.450]  I might have.
[02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:45.390]  I might have.
[02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:47.010]  I don't...
[02:00:47.010 --> 02:00:47.370]  know.
[02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:50.470]  Was cow in that other one?
[02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:55.410]  Chat needs your failure.
[02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:57.430]  Oh, yes!
[02:00:57.670 --> 02:00:59.410]  Oh, Nick!
[02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:02.050]  Nick beat the chat.
[02:01:02.370 --> 02:01:02.510]  No!
[02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:04.090]  I did it!
[02:01:04.570 --> 02:01:08.230]  My loserdom gets infected even to the chat.
[02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:10.060]  I brought the chat down.
[02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:13.090]  Andrew has ruined the chat streak.
[02:01:13.110 --> 02:01:14.090]  I did it!
[02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:14.770]  That's on me.
[02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:16.830]  I think...
[02:01:16.830 --> 02:01:17.910]  that...
[02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:19.250]  we have the perfect chat.
[02:01:20.190 --> 02:01:21.190]  Yeah, they're great.
[02:01:22.650 --> 02:01:23.630]  I like that.
[02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:25.650]  Please don't leave, please don't leave, please don't leave.
[02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:33.610]  Thanks for hanging out for the last two hours or so and watching us be bad at trivia, but you good at trivia.
[02:01:33.810 --> 02:01:35.690]  And then thanks for proving to us that you are good at trivia.
[02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.430]  Absolutely.
[02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:42.190]  And also thanks for going easy on Nick and giving him the win.
[02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:43.350]  Yeah, it was really nice.
[02:01:44.210 --> 02:01:45.510]  He does have the easiest life.
[02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:47.590]  Especially since I gotta go pee really bad.
[02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:49.490]  The man's got it.
[02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:53.170]  The man was given one toy as a child and it was a marble countertop.
[02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:54.610]  He's had a tough life.
[02:01:55.150 --> 02:01:56.950]  Those don't roll. I don't know if you know that.
[02:01:57.770 --> 02:02:01.130]  It's just your perspective on how things work.
[02:02:01.450 --> 02:02:02.450]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:03.970]  Thank you very much.
[02:02:04.090 --> 02:02:07.890]  We will be back next Friday, but there will be content on Monday.
[02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:09.870]  No, Monday's content.
[02:02:10.210 --> 02:02:10.410]  Wait.
[02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:10.850]  Sunday!
[02:02:11.650 --> 02:02:12.130]  Saturday?
[02:02:13.050 --> 02:02:14.510]  There's a game planned Saturday.
[02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:16.270]  There's a thing on Sunday.
[02:02:16.710 --> 02:02:17.610]  What thing?
[02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:20.730]  I believe it is the dog draft.
[02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:21.990]  Oh, it's the draft.
[02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:23.270]  For those who are bog-standard tier.
[02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:24.210]  And above.
[02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.670]  Yes.
[02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:27.370]  It'll be on the Patreon.
