[00:00.000 --> 00:01.040]  What are we doing, Gavin?
[00:01.800 --> 00:02.160]  Deadline!
[00:02.580 --> 00:03.120]  Tron bikes.
[00:03.640 --> 00:04.320]  Tron bikes?
[00:04.420 --> 00:05.260]  Tron bikes.
[00:06.020 --> 00:06.640]  Man, we...
[00:07.020 --> 00:09.380]  We were talking about how long it's been since we played GTA 4.
[00:09.560 --> 00:11.980]  I haven't played GTA 5 in a goddamn long time, either.
[00:12.560 --> 00:13.600]  It's been longer for me.
[00:14.120 --> 00:15.860]  I'm level 6. Does that matter?
[00:15.860 --> 00:16.060]  No, you're good.
[00:16.300 --> 00:16.860]  That's fine.
[00:19.840 --> 00:21.060]  136, 111, and 127.
[00:21.220 --> 00:23.800]  Your level is the max speed that you can drive, so don't worry about it.
[00:24.560 --> 00:25.080]  Oh, God.
[00:26.160 --> 00:27.840]  Oh, my God. Can I still do this?
[00:27.840 --> 00:30.910]  I still got it!
[00:31.500 --> 00:32.240]  That's exciting.
[00:32.280 --> 00:33.260]  How do I do the...
[00:36.540 --> 00:39.240]  If I double tap it, does it go like...
[00:41.800 --> 00:43.340]  Oh, it's the best, dude.
[00:44.220 --> 00:45.720]  I'll never get sick of that.
[00:48.940 --> 00:49.500]  Freak out.
[00:50.920 --> 00:52.400]  I don't think I've ever played this game type.
[00:52.720 --> 00:54.500]  I have no idea what we're about to do.
[00:54.740 --> 00:55.560]  You're about to die!
[00:56.240 --> 00:56.860]  So what's the goal?
[00:56.860 --> 00:59.600]  So you have a trail of hard light, and you want to kill people.
[00:59.800 --> 01:00.980]  Well, actually, you want to survive, mainly.
[01:01.580 --> 01:04.720]  But if you drive in front of people, it will endanger their lives.
[01:04.840 --> 01:06.260]  There's power-ups on the map, as well.
[01:07.060 --> 01:09.320]  There's a boost, there's a slow time, there's a jump.
[01:10.740 --> 01:11.360]  That's a bad start.
[01:11.900 --> 01:12.640]  That's a bad start.
[01:13.380 --> 01:15.060]  I killed Andrew. That was nice.
[01:15.340 --> 01:17.280]  Do you hold Y to boost in this one?
[01:18.220 --> 01:21.000]  I think you do left stick click to use the...
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.340]  Oh, I thought I was going to get in front of him.
[01:23.240 --> 01:25.760]  I really... I thought I was just about to get in front of him.
[01:25.760 --> 01:26.840]  Oh, dammit!
[01:27.080 --> 01:27.920]  You almost timed it out, right?
[01:28.620 --> 01:29.920]  Shit! Almost...
[01:30.700 --> 01:32.360]  Is there a jump? What's the jump button?
[01:32.540 --> 01:34.440]  You need to pick up a jump, and then it's left click.
[01:35.160 --> 01:36.360]  Oh, that's what it is. Thank you.
[01:37.620 --> 01:40.600]  And what you want to do, make sure to drive into the green line.
[01:40.720 --> 01:42.000]  That's the green line.
[01:43.860 --> 01:44.880]  That's the bonus line.
[01:44.920 --> 01:45.640]  I almost killed myself.
[01:49.820 --> 01:51.460]  If you stop, as well, you blow up.
[01:52.700 --> 01:53.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:53.060 --> 01:56.480]  Yeah, it's like Tron meets speed. I stopped.
[01:57.600 --> 01:58.120]  No!
[02:01.200 --> 02:03.760]  I got you, but I flew out of the area.
[02:05.300 --> 02:06.560]  I lost my power-up.
[02:07.100 --> 02:08.040]  I want to get me a little jump.
[02:09.100 --> 02:10.780]  We're going to lock in on Gavin.
[02:12.140 --> 02:13.220]  Yeah, he's a prick.
[02:14.680 --> 02:16.260]  What a jump there!
[02:16.520 --> 02:17.700]  That was awesome!
[02:17.960 --> 02:18.680]  I just leveled up!
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm level seven!
[02:22.840 --> 02:23.160]  Wow.
[02:23.360 --> 02:24.700]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:25.460 --> 02:26.960]  Oh, I was looking at Eric!
[02:30.260 --> 02:31.580]  How about that, bitch?
[02:33.680 --> 02:35.460]  If I'm not careful, I might be good at this.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.500]  Eric is being all smug and cocky.
[02:37.620 --> 02:38.400]  Kill him. Kill him. Kill him.
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.780]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh, Eric.
[02:43.200 --> 02:46.120]  Well, I thought that was jump, but what happened is that it was speed boost.
[02:48.080 --> 02:49.680]  The old death accelerator.
[02:49.860 --> 02:50.340]  They are different.
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.240]  That's... yeah.
[02:55.460 --> 02:56.520]  Oh, Gavin!
[02:58.040 --> 02:58.980]  Oh, damn it.
[02:59.240 --> 03:00.720]  Geoff's death may have saved your life, Eric.
[03:01.200 --> 03:01.600]  Good.
[03:03.160 --> 03:04.340]  Were you about to hit his line?
[03:04.640 --> 03:05.180]  You might have.
[03:06.720 --> 03:06.980]  Oops.
[03:07.780 --> 03:09.120]  Oh, I had my jump!
[03:09.980 --> 03:11.580]  I had jump locked in.
[03:11.660 --> 03:13.080]  I'm like, oh, this is great. I got jump.
[03:13.200 --> 03:14.280]  This is going to be so fucking easy.
[03:14.540 --> 03:15.140]  God, how much fun this is.
[03:15.260 --> 03:18.580]  If you're using the other one, I don't think you can collect another ability.
[03:19.100 --> 03:20.100]  Yeah, it overwrites.
[03:21.700 --> 03:22.500]  Oh, fuck.
[03:22.500 --> 03:23.300]  Oh, shit.
[03:26.300 --> 03:27.100]  Gavin power.
[03:27.420 --> 03:28.160]  Big surprise.
[03:29.800 --> 03:30.900]  That was so cool.
[03:33.120 --> 03:36.200]  So, there's also a mode where you can just switch it to whoever just gets the most kills.
[03:36.680 --> 03:37.160]  Oh, wow.
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.080]  Makes you more aggressive.
[03:38.300 --> 03:39.840]  This is really cool.
[03:40.260 --> 03:40.980]  I'm trying to be aggressive.
[03:41.080 --> 03:41.420]  Yeah, it's great.
[03:42.600 --> 03:43.080]  Big jump.
[03:43.740 --> 03:50.270]  I feel like I haven't seen Geoff much in this.
[03:50.830 --> 03:51.990]  Well, don't worry about it.
[03:52.150 --> 03:53.170]  Geoff has one life.
[03:53.610 --> 03:55.550]  Don't worry, Geoff's...
[03:55.550 --> 03:59.830]  Geoff has been doing the Geoff thing and killing himself.
[03:59.970 --> 04:00.970]  Oh, that's good. Way to go, bud.
[04:01.590 --> 04:06.070]  Oh, you guys, just leave Geoff alone and then Geoff will take care of Geoff.
[04:06.570 --> 04:10.950]  Oh, trapping myself with my own line.
[04:12.390 --> 04:13.970]  Tell me that wasn't sick as fuck, Nick.
[04:14.030 --> 04:15.130]  That was sick as fuck.
[04:16.210 --> 04:16.650]  Nick.
[04:17.110 --> 04:17.530]  Fuck!
[04:19.150 --> 04:20.250]  Oh, I trapped myself.
[04:20.890 --> 04:21.710]  Later, boys.
[04:21.710 --> 04:23.230]  That was good.
[04:27.730 --> 04:28.390]  Power up.
[04:28.870 --> 04:29.630]  Later, boys.
[04:33.350 --> 04:35.390]  It was going to be really cool, though.
[04:35.950 --> 04:36.530]  Don't you think?
[04:36.850 --> 04:38.970]  Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed the whole thing, honestly.
[04:39.650 --> 04:40.230]  Thanks, man.
[04:40.550 --> 04:40.770]  Yeah.
[04:44.970 --> 04:45.850]  Oh, shit.
[04:46.110 --> 04:46.730]  Oh, shit!
[04:47.030 --> 04:49.950]  I hit B to use my boost and the camera went crazy.
[04:50.930 --> 04:53.050]  Oh, yeah, B is, uh...
[04:53.050 --> 04:54.030]  That's Eric.
[04:54.290 --> 04:55.250]  That's Eric, son.
[04:57.250 --> 04:58.290]  No way!
[04:58.550 --> 04:59.370]  That was pretty cool.
[05:00.530 --> 05:02.650]  Gotta go left, gotta go left, gotta go left!
[05:02.670 --> 05:02.930]  Got him!
[05:04.310 --> 05:04.830]  No!
[05:07.930 --> 05:09.390]  That was awesome!
[05:10.110 --> 05:10.450]  No!
[05:10.650 --> 05:11.590]  That was so cool!
[05:11.670 --> 05:12.070]  Yes!
[05:12.470 --> 05:12.850]  I'm out!
[05:13.110 --> 05:13.830]  I'm good, everyone!
[05:14.370 --> 05:14.890]  Triple!
[05:15.070 --> 05:15.690]  Oh, no!
[05:16.750 --> 05:18.650]  I just killed every single person.
[05:18.650 --> 05:20.130]  You came out of nowhere!
[05:20.710 --> 05:22.230]  Oh, we gotta take out Gavin.
[05:22.510 --> 05:23.550]  Alright, Geoff is gone.
[05:24.250 --> 05:24.910]  Bring it on.
[05:25.410 --> 05:26.110]  He's too powerful.
[05:28.410 --> 05:37.750]  You said, bring it on, and we immediately brought it, and I was not ready for it.
[05:38.150 --> 05:38.970]  You brought it right to me.
[05:48.660 --> 05:49.040]  Andrew!
[05:49.700 --> 05:50.080]  Sorry!
[05:50.680 --> 05:51.760]  No, it wasn't you.
[05:51.840 --> 05:52.700]  I was trying to get Gavin.
[05:52.780 --> 05:53.400]  You came out of nowhere.
[05:53.400 --> 05:53.800]  It's good.
[05:53.840 --> 05:54.400]  I think I'm out.
[05:54.580 --> 05:56.140]  I was trying to cut him off.
[05:56.560 --> 05:56.920]  Yup.
[05:57.700 --> 05:58.660]  Cut this off.
[05:59.560 --> 06:00.800]  Okay, you went over there.
[06:02.080 --> 06:02.720]  What happened?
[06:03.100 --> 06:04.080]  I just said loser.
[06:04.280 --> 06:04.580]  I don't know.
[06:04.980 --> 06:05.540]  Time ran out.
[06:05.720 --> 06:06.500]  Oh, we had a timer?
[06:07.280 --> 06:07.860]  I think so.
[06:08.480 --> 06:08.700]  Boo!
[06:09.400 --> 06:10.060]  There's more.
[06:10.220 --> 06:10.780]  More of this.
[06:10.900 --> 06:11.180]  Keep going.
[06:11.340 --> 06:11.860]  I'm level seven.
[06:12.600 --> 06:14.320]  I like showing Eric all these games.
[06:14.440 --> 06:15.120]  He's like, yeah, more.
[06:15.220 --> 06:15.780]  Let's play more.
[06:15.900 --> 06:16.560]  I'm level seven.
[06:16.800 --> 06:18.080]  I don't even like video games.
[06:18.180 --> 06:18.640]  This is great.
[06:19.540 --> 06:20.400]  You do, though!
[06:21.760 --> 06:23.480]  If you're having fun doing this, you like them.
[06:23.480 --> 06:24.160]  I vote that I like it.
[06:24.160 --> 06:25.760]  Everybody hit Y to like it.
[06:26.120 --> 06:27.400]  Alright, we can do Deadline...
[06:28.100 --> 06:29.680]  Dude, I'm a Deadline 7 guy.
[06:29.840 --> 06:30.680]  No fucking doubt.
[06:31.180 --> 06:33.560]  Honestly, Deadline 6 is good.
[06:33.660 --> 06:34.920]  Deadline 7 is so fucking sick.
[06:35.380 --> 06:35.840]  Deadline 7 it is.
[06:35.960 --> 06:37.220]  There's one with, like, tubes.
[06:37.540 --> 06:38.660]  You can, like, drive on the ceiling.
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.620]  Oh, wow.
[06:39.840 --> 06:40.060]  Okay.
[06:40.440 --> 06:40.840]  Action!
[06:42.460 --> 06:42.860]  Go!
[06:44.220 --> 06:46.440]  This is still a thousand times faster than it used to be.
[06:47.600 --> 06:51.120]  Let's play this on 360 and see how your patience holds up.
[06:53.360 --> 06:54.880]  Or old Xbox One.
[06:55.260 --> 06:56.100]  Dude, no kidding.
[06:56.440 --> 06:57.280]  I mean, that's...
[06:57.280 --> 07:00.320]  I'm so glad we got these new Xboxes and it's still like this!
[07:01.040 --> 07:03.840]  Have you looked at the store page for GTA 5?
[07:03.900 --> 07:04.840]  It's a mess.
[07:05.020 --> 07:05.540]  Is it really?
[07:05.820 --> 07:07.800]  Dude, it's an absolute shit show.
[07:07.860 --> 07:08.940]  There's so many different versions.
[07:09.620 --> 07:15.700]  When we were playing Gears before I put the new Xbox in here and I was using the old one that you guys were using until yesterday...
[07:15.700 --> 07:21.460]  They would play the level and die before I loaded it in.
[07:22.360 --> 07:25.980]  There was a run where for maybe like 10 straight minutes I didn't play.
[07:26.220 --> 07:28.900]  Because I just couldn't get into the game fast enough because of the old Xbox.
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.160]  We were dying so fast, Geoff's robot would just be sat still.
[07:33.300 --> 07:38.080]  It's very funny that you guys got new Xboxes and we immediately played two 360 games.
[07:41.820 --> 07:44.500]  This is a modern version, I think.
[07:45.700 --> 07:46.160]  It is.
[07:47.560 --> 07:52.260]  By the way, speaking of Xbox 360, how much fun was 3D Ultra Mini Golf?
[07:52.700 --> 07:53.100]  Gotcha!
[07:54.680 --> 07:56.940]  That game's the best. And I got DLC today for it.
[07:58.300 --> 08:00.600]  Yeah, you're like all about 3D Ultra Mini Golf, huh?
[08:01.480 --> 08:05.440]  I've always loved it. It's like I have a love-hate relationship with it. It's just a lot of fun.
[08:05.760 --> 08:06.160]  Damn it!
[08:06.880 --> 08:11.800]  And I think the thing I like about it is it's one of those games that the audience just absolutely adored.
[08:13.940 --> 08:14.760]  It's a lot of fun.
[08:15.700 --> 08:19.200]  Good Lord, what am I doing with my life? What am I doing?!
[08:19.200 --> 08:20.800]  Did you trap yourself? What happened?
[08:24.480 --> 08:25.940]  Oh, Eric, I don't...
[08:25.940 --> 08:29.540]  Don't even... Nick, this is for you. Don't even sweat it, bro.
[08:29.720 --> 08:30.600]  Oh, I'm sweating.
[08:31.920 --> 08:33.460]  I want one of those abilities.
[08:35.920 --> 08:37.780]  Give it to me. Give it to me. Yeah.
[08:40.780 --> 08:44.140]  Oh! You piece of shit! You piece of shit!
[08:44.500 --> 08:45.520]  I'm coming for you!
[08:49.200 --> 08:51.240]  I had to do a blind cut, but it was worth it.
[08:52.600 --> 08:54.560]  I keep missing the jump.
[08:55.820 --> 08:58.860]  It gets so quiet in the second game that everybody's like...
[08:58.860 --> 09:00.320]  Oh yeah, now that I know what the fuck I'm doing...
[09:00.320 --> 09:02.160]  Suddenly the crosstalk's fucking...
[09:03.060 --> 09:04.100]  Get in that hate hole.
[09:04.880 --> 09:05.740]  Pleasant trees are done.
[09:05.960 --> 09:06.920]  Yeah, the hate hole.
[09:08.040 --> 09:08.280]  Oh!
[09:09.160 --> 09:10.500]  Oh, there's stuff down here, too.
[09:11.500 --> 09:13.560]  Oh, I forgot. Yeah, the lower thing is...
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.920]  Yeah, fuck you, man! Hey, remember?
[09:15.040 --> 09:15.600]  Oh, there is a lower!
[09:15.600 --> 09:15.980]  Remember that shit?
[09:15.980 --> 09:17.480]  I didn't know that.
[09:17.860 --> 09:19.300]  Yeah, it's not just death down there.
[09:19.340 --> 09:20.740]  Although, it might be.
[09:21.400 --> 09:22.140]  Looks like it.
[09:22.660 --> 09:23.120]  The lighthouse.
[09:26.160 --> 09:26.960]  Hate house.
[09:27.700 --> 09:28.020]  Oh, God!
[09:30.040 --> 09:31.320]  Geoff just came flying in.
[09:32.760 --> 09:34.400]  Eric has yet to die in this level.
[09:34.900 --> 09:35.320]  Got him.
[09:37.820 --> 09:40.480]  I was ready to see that that far out, Eric.
[09:41.220 --> 09:41.640]  Thank you.
[09:41.840 --> 09:42.220]  Whoa!
[09:42.220 --> 09:46.220]  We knew Eric would do well in this one, because this is his favorite.
[09:46.260 --> 09:48.040]  I told you, seven's the fucking one, bro.
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.240]  You didn't want to listen.
[09:50.800 --> 09:52.100]  Nobody wants to listen to Eric.
[09:52.320 --> 09:53.020]  Take that!
[09:53.700 --> 09:55.460]  Oh, I jumped too early, Nick!
[09:58.180 --> 09:59.060]  Oh, dear.
[09:59.720 --> 10:02.320]  Should have used the ramp to my advantage.
[10:03.780 --> 10:04.740]  Disadvantaged myself.
[10:05.960 --> 10:06.420]  You fool.
[10:09.300 --> 10:10.200]  Ah, you fools.
[10:10.680 --> 10:11.800]  Oh, shit.
[10:14.100 --> 10:14.660]  Shit.
[10:15.480 --> 10:16.320]  Shit.
[10:17.600 --> 10:17.780]  Shit.
[10:18.820 --> 10:19.580]  No!
[10:20.820 --> 10:21.380]  No!
[10:22.400 --> 10:22.800]  Yeah!
[10:25.720 --> 10:27.020]  Oh, God.
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.000]  I thought it was...
[10:28.000 --> 10:28.860]  Oh, shit, Geoff.
[10:29.200 --> 10:30.340]  What's up, bud?
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.240]  Damn it!
[10:41.160 --> 10:41.900]  What's up, Gavin?
[10:43.040 --> 10:43.940]  Oh, that's not a jump.
[10:44.860 --> 10:45.760]  Oh, Eric.
[10:46.220 --> 10:46.940]  Killed myself.
[10:47.600 --> 10:48.740]  I thought I had a jump.
[10:48.840 --> 10:49.000]  Had a boost.
[10:49.040 --> 10:49.460]  No!
[10:50.380 --> 10:51.140]  That's the second time that's happened.
[10:51.140 --> 10:53.060]  You gotta get your boost and your jumps figured out.
[10:53.460 --> 10:53.520]  Nah.
[10:54.780 --> 10:55.920]  Nah, I think I'm fine.
[10:56.680 --> 10:57.460]  Oh, shit.
[10:57.840 --> 10:58.260]  Shit.
[11:01.340 --> 11:03.780]  Oh, fuck.
[11:05.780 --> 11:09.600]  Now, imagine how cool this would be if we could listen to the music of the game in this also.
[11:09.600 --> 11:10.140]  Oh, yeah.
[11:11.020 --> 11:14.420]  Well, the music of this game is custom to the game, I think, isn't it?
[11:14.580 --> 11:16.380]  Oh, like the game type?
[11:18.740 --> 11:20.900]  Gavin got right in front of me.
[11:21.280 --> 11:21.840]  Damn.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.060]  He's good at that.
[11:25.400 --> 11:25.960]  Ugly.
[11:26.320 --> 11:27.660]  I saw that.
[11:28.020 --> 11:29.400]  Witness to that mess.
[11:30.580 --> 11:32.820]  Oh, Geoff is just destroying me.
[11:33.980 --> 11:34.760]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[11:35.260 --> 11:36.540]  I could destroy Geoff.
[11:36.960 --> 11:37.780]  Oh, no!
[11:41.980 --> 11:43.900]  It happened so fast.
[11:44.380 --> 11:45.380]  God damn it.
[11:47.160 --> 11:48.480]  I'm out of lives.
[11:49.280 --> 11:49.980]  Oh, wow.
[11:50.860 --> 11:51.860]  I'm in a bad spot.
[11:53.700 --> 11:55.320]  You piece of shit!
[11:55.820 --> 11:56.780]  You piece of shit!
[11:56.880 --> 11:57.800]  Just get back!
[12:03.900 --> 12:07.640]  Oh, is that Eric?
[12:08.100 --> 12:08.580]  Got him.
[12:09.600 --> 12:10.500]  Yeah, it was me.
[12:11.740 --> 12:13.040]  That's why I was being quiet.
[12:15.360 --> 12:17.600]  Give me a nice little landing pad there.
[12:18.080 --> 12:18.710]  No kidding.
[12:19.800 --> 12:21.100]  Nothing I can do.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.080]  What's up?
[12:26.580 --> 12:28.000]  Oh, what a flip.
[12:28.180 --> 12:28.620]  Not much.
[12:28.700 --> 12:29.800]  Oh, shit.
[12:30.200 --> 12:30.480]  Wow.
[12:30.480 --> 12:31.860]  I banged my head on Geoff's line.
[12:33.440 --> 12:37.540]  Oh, Geoff's got all the lives.
[12:37.720 --> 12:37.980]  Too much.
[12:37.980 --> 12:42.540]  I like your game.
[12:42.760 --> 12:43.980]  Oh, shit, shit, shit.
[12:44.240 --> 12:44.960]  You bitch!
[12:45.300 --> 12:46.480]  You bitch!
[12:47.140 --> 12:49.340]  How did you do that, you little fuck?
[12:50.400 --> 12:51.400]  That was a little wibbler.
[12:53.260 --> 12:55.180]  Now Gavin's catching up real fast.
[12:58.320 --> 12:58.880]  This is getting interesting.
[12:58.900 --> 12:59.860]  Oh, Eric!
[13:00.100 --> 13:00.640]  You lied!
[13:01.760 --> 13:02.760]  That was a howl.
[13:02.780 --> 13:04.320]  Just like that, I'm Geoffing it.
[13:05.120 --> 13:06.860]  Oh my god, I almost killed myself.
[13:08.200 --> 13:08.720]  Bye.
[13:09.580 --> 13:10.180]  Uh-oh.
[13:10.420 --> 13:10.680]  Got him.
[13:11.920 --> 13:12.880]  Well, that's...
[13:13.400 --> 13:15.180]  You are dominating Geoff.
[13:15.480 --> 13:15.820]  Yeah.
[13:16.700 --> 13:17.180]  Yeah.
[13:19.180 --> 13:20.740]  I'm painting nasty lines.
[13:28.670 --> 13:30.030]  Much too much.
[13:34.870 --> 13:36.870]  I really thought I was getting in front of you.
[13:37.570 --> 13:38.230]  God damn it.
[13:38.310 --> 13:39.470]  I really thought I was getting in front of you.
[13:39.570 --> 13:40.830]  What a jump, Geoff.
[13:41.470 --> 13:42.630]  That was straight up chicken.
[13:45.010 --> 13:46.250]  About to be outdone.
[13:46.330 --> 13:47.010]  Here comes Eric.
[13:49.910 --> 13:51.610]  Trying to line something up, Gavin.
[13:52.810 --> 13:53.930]  What are you doing, head on?
[13:54.030 --> 13:54.630]  God damn.
[13:54.650 --> 13:56.190]  Oh, and he gets Eric.
[13:56.530 --> 13:56.990]  God damn.
[13:58.550 --> 14:00.390]  Andrew, how long have you been dead?
[14:00.750 --> 14:02.270]  At least four minutes.
[14:02.730 --> 14:03.510]  Oh my god.
[14:03.630 --> 14:04.310]  Andrew, are you green?
[14:04.910 --> 14:06.390]  I just got out.
[14:06.450 --> 14:06.990]  Are you just flying on the track?
[14:07.350 --> 14:08.050]  Oh my god.
[14:08.050 --> 14:08.190]  I think so.
[14:09.210 --> 14:10.590]  Alright, I'll follow...
[14:10.590 --> 14:11.550]  Let me see.
[14:11.650 --> 14:13.170]  I'll follow Geoff if you follow Gavin.
[14:13.430 --> 14:15.770]  Then we got cameras.
[14:19.140 --> 14:19.710]  Oh no.
[14:20.030 --> 14:20.950]  What a jump.
[14:21.410 --> 14:21.470]  Wow.
[14:22.790 --> 14:24.570]  Oh, Gavin went down.
[14:26.270 --> 14:27.970]  What a turn.
[14:32.630 --> 14:33.250]  Damn.
[14:35.990 --> 14:36.610]  Damn.
[14:36.770 --> 14:38.410]  Good job, Gav.
[14:38.590 --> 14:39.110]  I like you.
[14:39.490 --> 14:41.010]  Do you want to change it to murdering or not?
[14:42.110 --> 14:42.950]  Yeah, we can do that.
[14:43.030 --> 14:43.270]  You want to?
[14:43.370 --> 14:43.910]  Yeah, whatever you want.
[14:44.230 --> 14:44.830]  Alright, here we go.
[14:44.990 --> 14:46.030]  What is the difference now?
[14:48.450 --> 14:49.450]  We're racking up kills.
[14:50.130 --> 14:50.730]  Points for killing.
[14:50.910 --> 14:53.930]  You don't have a limited pool of life.
[14:54.710 --> 14:55.790]  Right underneath us, God.
[14:57.250 --> 14:57.610]  Damn.
[14:58.290 --> 14:58.750]  That was messy.
[14:58.750 --> 14:59.490]  Everything happened.
[15:01.230 --> 15:02.410]  Everybody died all at once.
[15:02.710 --> 15:03.170]  Yeah, really.
[15:03.250 --> 15:03.990]  That was really quick.
[15:09.280 --> 15:09.720]  Wow.
[15:10.840 --> 15:11.760]  Did I miss?
[15:12.960 --> 15:14.760]  Fucking assholes in my buttholes.
[15:15.100 --> 15:15.300]  Uh oh.
[15:15.400 --> 15:16.360]  I've made a mistake.
[15:16.820 --> 15:17.120]  Oh.
[15:18.940 --> 15:20.700]  I got lucky that you died.
[15:21.760 --> 15:23.580]  I was about to run right into one of your lines.
[15:24.260 --> 15:24.660]  Damn it.
[15:26.220 --> 15:28.380]  This is some tight fucking quarters, man.
[15:28.560 --> 15:29.600]  This is pretty tight.
[15:31.720 --> 15:33.920]  You could have a purple line coming out of nowhere.
[15:34.440 --> 15:34.720]  Oh, shit.
[15:34.900 --> 15:34.920]  Oh, shit.
[15:34.920 --> 15:35.020]  Oh, shit.
[15:38.420 --> 15:39.220]  Uh oh.
[15:40.300 --> 15:41.060]  That's a wall.
[15:41.560 --> 15:42.180]  Wrong turn.
[15:42.600 --> 15:42.720]  Suicide.
[15:43.140 --> 15:44.680]  I think suicide removes a point.
[15:45.220 --> 15:46.300]  Oh, good to know.
[15:47.900 --> 15:48.080]  Whoops.
[15:48.080 --> 15:49.080]  I don't know if Eric killed anyone.
[15:49.660 --> 15:50.740]  So he didn't get negative at least.
[15:50.980 --> 15:51.220]  No.
[15:51.540 --> 15:51.780]  Okay.
[15:52.200 --> 15:53.460]  At least I'm not down in the dumps, baby.
[15:55.220 --> 15:55.820]  Dump down.
[15:56.560 --> 15:59.020]  Fuck, fucking, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[15:59.060 --> 15:59.400]  Got him.
[16:07.060 --> 16:08.440]  Oh, I thought that was a fucking...
[16:08.440 --> 16:10.320]  I thought I could go on top of that thing.
[16:10.320 --> 16:11.080]  I thought that was like a ramp.
[16:11.380 --> 16:11.780]  Fuck.
[16:11.860 --> 16:13.100]  It did look like a ramp.
[16:16.990 --> 16:17.930]  Now that's a ramp.
[16:23.470 --> 16:24.270]  Damn it.
[16:32.210 --> 16:33.170]  Landed right on it.
[16:34.230 --> 16:36.690]  It was so awesome how you lived just to die.
[16:37.130 --> 16:37.330]  Yeah.
[16:38.990 --> 16:40.030]  I lived to die.
[16:40.810 --> 16:41.210]  Oh.
[16:41.790 --> 16:42.190]  Oh.
[16:42.690 --> 16:43.530]  Oh, no.
[16:45.810 --> 16:46.610]  Jesus Christ.
[16:47.310 --> 16:48.190]  Oh, there's a light here.
[16:48.730 --> 16:49.130]  Damn.
[16:51.650 --> 16:53.730]  Geez, Geoff is dominating in this one.
[16:53.970 --> 16:55.090]  Geoff is killing it.
[16:55.690 --> 16:56.330]  He's gonna win.
[16:56.770 --> 16:57.630]  He needs one more.
[16:57.650 --> 16:58.510]  Why did you have to say that out loud?
[16:59.550 --> 17:00.970]  I fucking blew myself up.
[17:01.170 --> 17:02.570]  See, why did you say it out loud?
[17:02.670 --> 17:03.210]  Now he needs two more.
[17:03.210 --> 17:04.330]  I drove into a fucking wall.
[17:04.470 --> 17:05.210]  He needs two more.
[17:08.670 --> 17:11.550]  What the fuck was that?
[17:11.630 --> 17:12.330]  There you go.
[17:12.470 --> 17:13.190]  Come on.
[17:13.590 --> 17:15.070]  How did you live?
[17:15.430 --> 17:16.250]  Oh, come on.
[17:16.290 --> 17:17.050]  I was trying to get there.
[17:17.970 --> 17:19.250]  I even used my boost.
[17:22.810 --> 17:23.630]  Damn it.
[17:24.350 --> 17:26.270]  All right.
[17:26.370 --> 17:26.870]  3-3.
[17:28.250 --> 17:28.830]  Oh, no.
[17:29.430 --> 17:30.150]  Oh, slow motion.
[17:33.190 --> 17:34.610]  Get me out.
[17:35.650 --> 17:36.650]  How did you live?
[17:37.330 --> 17:39.130]  I killed myself.
[17:41.710 --> 17:43.690]  He went up a ramp, Gavin.
[17:43.950 --> 17:44.450]  Got him.
[17:44.890 --> 17:45.990]  You got me there.
[17:46.550 --> 17:47.370]  I watched you.
[17:50.770 --> 17:52.030]  Andrew, you're not doing great.
[17:52.830 --> 17:53.530]  I suck.
[17:54.150 --> 17:55.110]  I suck shit.
[17:59.210 --> 18:00.770]  Down to one point.
[18:03.470 --> 18:05.250]  Oh, what a bounce.
[18:09.280 --> 18:10.680]  You need to relax, Gavin.
[18:11.740 --> 18:13.080]  How did you get out of that?
[18:16.740 --> 18:18.560]  Oh, I thought I bunny-hopped it just in time.
[18:20.600 --> 18:21.000]  Fuck.
[18:24.620 --> 18:26.260]  I did that all via the mini-map.
[18:26.380 --> 18:27.080]  I couldn't see anything.
[18:28.860 --> 18:31.240]  Oh, come on.
[18:32.640 --> 18:33.380]  Someone won?
[18:36.280 --> 18:37.080]  Who won?
[18:37.240 --> 18:38.400]  I think you did, Gavin.
[18:38.740 --> 18:39.300]  Or Eric.
[18:39.300 --> 18:40.540]  No, Eric didn't win.
[18:41.100 --> 18:42.180]  I didn't fucking win.
[18:42.800 --> 18:45.320]  It did say winner for me, but I didn't think I was that close to winning.
[18:46.060 --> 18:47.680]  And you got a double kill right at the end.
[18:47.880 --> 18:48.720]  Oh, that would be wild.
[18:48.720 --> 18:48.880]  Sick.
[18:48.880 --> 18:49.320]  You had three.
[18:50.500 --> 18:51.080]  Stramtam, huh?
[18:54.340 --> 18:55.060]  What's Chittle?
[18:57.040 --> 18:58.680]  It was a...
[18:58.680 --> 19:01.260]  My friends used to call the group Chicago Ted Libs.
[19:01.620 --> 19:02.760]  It's a reference to Left 4 Dead.
[19:03.520 --> 19:06.720]  There's a dude who scribbles on the walls who calls himself Chicago Ted.
[19:09.840 --> 19:10.560]  That's awesome.
[19:11.360 --> 19:12.900]  That was the best part of Left 4 Dead.
[19:13.540 --> 19:16.920]  There was all kinds of story in that game if you just read the walls.
[19:17.860 --> 19:19.520]  It's almost like Paul and stuff.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.020]  Yeah, it was really cool and now we can't play it.
[19:26.180 --> 19:28.180]  Do you have physical copies? Do you have those copies?
[19:28.540 --> 19:28.900]  Those games?
[19:29.180 --> 19:30.680]  Andrew, you do, right? Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2?
[19:30.900 --> 19:31.100]  Yes.
[19:34.700 --> 19:35.060]  Alright.
[19:39.650 --> 19:40.010]  Alright.
[19:41.530 --> 19:43.270]  Eric and Nick have no idea what we're doing there.
[19:43.450 --> 19:44.070]  No, I remember that.
[19:44.130 --> 19:45.050]  I mean, you were going...
[19:46.810 --> 19:47.990]  You try to...
[19:47.990 --> 19:53.810]  You can hit emotes, hand emotes, and I was doing the freak out, but you try to do it and then...
[19:53.810 --> 19:56.950]  When the game starts, it freezes the screen.
[19:57.050 --> 19:57.310]  Awesome.
[19:57.410 --> 19:59.190]  You try to get it so that it freezes at mid.
[19:59.530 --> 20:03.470]  Yeah, I was trying to release my Spaffra as it freezes, but I didn't manage it.
[20:03.710 --> 20:04.110]  Sorry, Nick.
[20:05.410 --> 20:06.130]  It had to be done.
[20:06.290 --> 20:06.490]  Okay.
[20:07.870 --> 20:08.690]  Now you get it.
[20:08.810 --> 20:09.250]  Welcome to Deadline, Nick.
[20:09.290 --> 20:09.930]  Oh, shit!
[20:10.090 --> 20:10.710]  I remember that.
[20:10.930 --> 20:12.470]  You can go way up on the wall?
[20:13.130 --> 20:14.490]  I was living on the wall there.
[20:15.170 --> 20:16.910]  Oh, you are crazy, Nick.
[20:17.290 --> 20:18.070]  Nick, you got...
[20:18.070 --> 20:18.730]  Nick, you have to...
[20:18.730 --> 20:21.030]  You go after that when you have a speed boost or a jump.
[20:21.470 --> 20:22.150]  That was a fool's errand.
[20:25.190 --> 20:28.610]  Oh, how dare you cover the boost with lines.
[20:29.370 --> 20:31.110]  Ah, shit, now I'm blocking myself from it.
[20:31.310 --> 20:32.070]  You fuck...
[20:32.070 --> 20:33.070]  What's up, dudes?
[20:37.930 --> 20:40.310]  Time my line in a knot.
[20:40.830 --> 20:42.490]  God bless America.
[20:42.570 --> 20:43.130]  Oh, no.
[20:43.170 --> 20:44.990]  Who's going out of the map?
[20:45.630 --> 20:46.310]  Oh, no.
[20:46.430 --> 20:47.350]  That was like a comet.
[20:51.470 --> 20:52.350]  Andy's comet.
[20:52.690 --> 20:53.230]  I boosted to the left.
[20:56.930 --> 20:58.350]  Eat my line!
[20:59.250 --> 20:59.830]  Geoff!
[21:01.250 --> 21:02.990]  I can't believe you didn't die.
[21:03.270 --> 21:03.510]  No!
[21:04.050 --> 21:05.030]  Absolute heck.
[21:05.170 --> 21:06.710]  I can't believe I lived through that.
[21:07.230 --> 21:08.790]  I can't believe I lived through that.
[21:08.790 --> 21:09.150]  I died.
[21:13.590 --> 21:15.630]  I can't believe Nick died. He wasn't even over there.
[21:15.790 --> 21:16.030]  Yeah.
[21:16.990 --> 21:17.910]  Came out of nowhere.
[21:19.870 --> 21:21.090]  Uh-oh, green line.
[21:23.330 --> 21:24.710]  Why are you so hard to get?
[21:25.290 --> 21:27.250]  Give me. Give me you. Thank you.
[21:27.650 --> 21:28.350]  Give me you.
[21:30.150 --> 21:30.950]  Jesus Christ!
[21:32.110 --> 21:32.810]  Tried the boost.
[21:36.210 --> 21:37.250]  I want that jump.
[21:37.290 --> 21:38.170]  Oh, you bitch!
[21:39.410 --> 21:41.570]  This is good defense. Oh, shit. No, it's not. Best defense. Good offense.
[21:43.630 --> 21:46.030]  Best offense is a good offense. Best offense is a great offense.
[21:46.470 --> 21:47.770]  Everybody excited to watch yourself display tonight?
[21:47.930 --> 21:48.490]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[21:49.890 --> 21:51.550]  You're gonna be fine. You got this.
[21:52.070 --> 21:55.050]  I just did a whole so alright about how fucking scared I am.
[21:57.650 --> 21:59.130]  Also how confident I am.
[21:59.630 --> 21:59.870]  Whoa!
[22:00.610 --> 22:01.890]  It's a weird mix, isn't it?
[22:03.050 --> 22:03.570]  No!
[22:05.190 --> 22:06.790]  I do not trust my abilities.
[22:07.130 --> 22:09.570]  Try honking your horn as well. It makes a really nice noise.
[22:12.830 --> 22:14.730]  Finally, I'm on the board.
[22:14.990 --> 22:15.730]  Oh, what happened there?
[22:16.510 --> 22:17.790]  A little jump for you.
[22:18.330 --> 22:19.570]  A little jump.
[22:20.870 --> 22:21.230]  Oh!
[22:23.330 --> 22:24.890]  Oh, what the...
[22:25.690 --> 22:26.950]  Fuck, I'm fucked there.
[22:28.170 --> 22:29.330]  There was no way.
[22:30.250 --> 22:31.210]  Jesus Christ.
[22:34.150 --> 22:34.790]  Oh.
[22:35.050 --> 22:35.850]  Uh-oh.
[22:36.370 --> 22:36.410]  Uh-oh.
[22:38.970 --> 22:39.490]  Oh!
[22:40.570 --> 22:41.550]  Hello, Gavin.
[22:42.050 --> 22:42.970]  No, Nick!
[22:43.590 --> 22:44.250]  Oh, I got him!
[22:44.770 --> 22:46.390]  Oh, I'm dying. I'm killing myself.
[22:46.810 --> 22:47.150]  Awesome.
[22:47.150 --> 22:48.550]  You're killing yourself? Save me.
[22:48.990 --> 22:49.690]  Oh, boy!
[22:49.890 --> 22:50.110]  Oh, Nick!
[22:50.330 --> 22:51.450]  Oh, Nick!
[22:51.730 --> 22:53.650]  I saw Nick fly!
[22:58.910 --> 23:00.710]  I got the jumps.
[23:02.990 --> 23:03.790]  Whoa, whoa.
[23:04.670 --> 23:05.650]  Get in my line.
[23:06.930 --> 23:07.730]  Fuck off.
[23:10.310 --> 23:10.710]  No!
[23:11.090 --> 23:11.410]  Yes!
[23:13.290 --> 23:14.850]  I thought I could cross you at the boost.
[23:17.030 --> 23:18.490]  Oh, dangerous game, Nick.
[23:19.350 --> 23:20.330]  Dangerous game, Nick!
[23:20.830 --> 23:22.210]  Oh, my God.
[23:22.330 --> 23:22.550]  It's alright.
[23:22.970 --> 23:23.370]  Unbelievable.
[23:24.250 --> 23:24.530]  It's alright.
[23:25.330 --> 23:26.110]  I could have played it better.
[23:26.190 --> 23:26.270]  It's alright.
[23:26.290 --> 23:26.970]  I could have played it worse.
[23:27.910 --> 23:28.170]  I'm fine.
[23:29.490 --> 23:30.050]  You're good.
[23:30.050 --> 23:31.330]  You're good.
[23:31.650 --> 23:32.610]  Too high.
[23:32.750 --> 23:33.090]  Too high!
[23:33.250 --> 23:34.630]  Oh, Icarus!
[23:35.330 --> 23:36.250]  Oh, Icarus!
[23:36.670 --> 23:37.290]  Oh, boy!
[23:37.510 --> 23:38.070]  My wings!
[23:39.610 --> 23:41.130]  He circled you in.
[23:41.270 --> 23:41.770]  Get trapped!
[23:42.350 --> 23:43.330]  Get trapped, you fool!
[23:44.750 --> 23:49.910]  Oh, I didn't jump better.
[23:50.210 --> 23:53.150]  I didn't jump better.
[23:55.350 --> 23:55.990]  Nope!
[23:58.470 --> 23:59.410]  Sorry, Andrew.
[23:59.410 --> 24:00.710]  Pretty even game, except for Nick.
[24:00.710 --> 24:00.890]  Every time.
[24:01.450 --> 24:01.630]  Yep.
[24:03.410 --> 24:11.500]  Oh, Andrew.
[24:12.480 --> 24:12.980]  Oh, Andrew.
[24:13.680 --> 24:14.220]  Fuck you.
[24:14.660 --> 24:15.280]  Going back.
[24:15.800 --> 24:16.160]  Oh!
[24:16.280 --> 24:16.860]  No!
[24:17.240 --> 24:17.440]  No!
[24:17.880 --> 24:19.280]  Get into my line!
[24:19.420 --> 24:19.840]  Nick!
[24:19.840 --> 24:20.280]  No!
[24:22.880 --> 24:25.040]  I had such a good start.
[24:25.240 --> 24:26.280]  I just ruined it.
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.880]  God bless you.
[24:30.360 --> 24:30.440]  Shit.
[24:31.660 --> 24:32.740]  I killed myself.
[24:32.740 --> 24:33.400]  I'll take the kill there.
[24:35.760 --> 24:36.700]  Here we go.
[24:37.740 --> 24:39.140]  Did you actually kill yourself, or did I kill you?
[24:39.620 --> 24:40.540]  No, you killed me.
[24:40.920 --> 24:41.360]  Oh, good.
[24:41.620 --> 24:41.900]  Ah!
[24:43.040 --> 24:43.440]  Excellent.
[24:43.520 --> 24:44.020]  You killed Nick.
[24:44.340 --> 24:45.300]  I mean, for all intents and purposes.
[24:45.720 --> 24:45.960]  Hmm.
[24:46.260 --> 24:46.440]  Oh!
[24:50.900 --> 24:52.740]  I ended the kill streak of Geoff.
[24:55.500 --> 24:56.520]  You got it, Nick.
[24:56.540 --> 24:57.280]  Good work, Nick.
[24:57.280 --> 24:58.140]  You almost got it.
[24:58.220 --> 24:58.560]  Doing great.
[24:58.560 --> 24:59.060]  Doing great.
[24:59.160 --> 24:59.620]  Yeah, dude.
[25:01.580 --> 25:01.980]  God.
[25:02.480 --> 25:02.880]  Fuck.
[25:03.240 --> 25:04.840]  I mean, that mini-map helped so much, dude.
[25:05.080 --> 25:05.280]  Yeah.
[25:07.500 --> 25:08.160]  Way to go, bud.
[25:08.540 --> 25:09.280]  Yeah, I'm doing great.
[25:09.780 --> 25:09.960]  Yep.
[25:14.090 --> 25:14.490]  Oh.
[25:16.670 --> 25:17.910]  Oh, I hate being in the hole.
[25:17.910 --> 25:18.410]  It's a trap, isn't it?
[25:18.870 --> 25:19.230]  Oh!
[25:19.490 --> 25:20.210]  You prick.
[25:20.670 --> 25:21.070]  Yes!
[25:21.510 --> 25:22.990]  Out, out, out, out, out, out.
[25:23.050 --> 25:23.330]  Bail out.
[25:23.430 --> 25:24.230]  Let's go for the double!
[25:25.290 --> 25:25.630]  Dammit.
[25:25.770 --> 25:25.910]  No!
[25:26.430 --> 25:26.830]  Oh!
[25:28.210 --> 25:28.610]  Hey!
[25:29.450 --> 25:30.390]  Oh, that's the end.
[25:30.390 --> 25:31.030]  Wow.
[25:32.670 --> 25:33.070]  Bullshit.
[25:33.790 --> 25:34.190]  Goddammit.
[25:35.370 --> 25:38.170]  I hit the boost and I could not get out of your path.
[25:38.270 --> 25:39.450]  Like, I was skidding.
[25:39.850 --> 25:41.270]  I was skidding into your death.
[25:41.990 --> 25:43.130]  Did Jerry West die?
[25:43.350 --> 25:43.850]  Yeah, he died.
[25:44.090 --> 25:45.110]  Yeah, did you not know that?
[25:45.210 --> 25:46.530]  I didn't bring it up because I assumed you knew.
[25:47.250 --> 25:47.410]  Yes.
[25:47.550 --> 25:47.830]  No!
[25:47.910 --> 25:48.310]  Yeah.
[25:48.470 --> 25:49.110]  When did he die?
[25:49.430 --> 25:50.090]  Uh, today.
[25:50.310 --> 25:50.730]  Yesterday or something?
[25:50.930 --> 25:51.190]  Oh, yeah.
[25:53.710 --> 25:55.390]  Nick, you have to get ready to play.
[25:55.670 --> 25:55.990]  Oh, okay.
[25:57.230 --> 25:57.950]  I got it!
[25:58.110 --> 25:58.390]  Oh, shit.
[25:58.550 --> 25:59.110]  I messed it up.
[25:59.110 --> 26:03.870]  Somebody was saying that he would rather die than see the Celtics win another championship.
[26:07.910 --> 26:10.330]  That bodes pretty well for the Celtics then, I guess, huh?
[26:10.350 --> 26:11.010]  I think so.
[26:11.850 --> 26:12.850]  Yeah, he died today.
[26:13.110 --> 26:13.470]  Oh, fuck.
[26:13.490 --> 26:13.970]  I was playing.
[26:14.110 --> 26:14.790]  I was looking at my phone.
[26:14.910 --> 26:15.170]  I'm dead.
[26:15.870 --> 26:16.230]  Goddammit.
[26:16.990 --> 26:17.650]  Oh, my God.
[26:17.770 --> 26:18.310]  How did I live?
[26:19.270 --> 26:20.170]  I committed suicide.
[26:20.790 --> 26:22.230]  This map is dark.
[26:22.650 --> 26:24.190]  This map is hard.
[26:25.770 --> 26:26.590]  You can probably go down below.
[26:26.590 --> 26:28.050]  This is advanced deadlining.
[26:29.110 --> 26:30.570]  This map goes hard.
[26:30.650 --> 26:31.490]  This is fucking awesome.
[26:32.690 --> 26:33.850]  Okay, let's try that again.
[26:36.010 --> 26:37.030]  Can you go down?
[26:37.410 --> 26:38.050]  Let's find out.
[26:38.950 --> 26:40.410]  So, it turns out...
[26:40.410 --> 26:41.110]  Nick, you can't go down there.
[26:41.210 --> 26:42.710]  It turns out you cannot go down there.
[26:44.110 --> 26:45.330]  I'm chasing my tip.
[26:46.470 --> 26:46.690]  What?
[26:47.870 --> 26:48.070]  Huh?
[26:48.210 --> 26:48.410]  Oh.
[26:50.790 --> 26:51.950]  He's trying to suck his dick.
[26:52.030 --> 26:52.730]  He's just tipping over.
[26:52.730 --> 26:53.110]  Oh!
[26:54.650 --> 26:55.230]  Oh, no!
[26:55.790 --> 26:56.690]  He's going schmee mode.
[26:56.690 --> 26:57.050]  He's going schmee mode.
[26:57.230 --> 26:57.370]  Okay.
[26:57.370 --> 26:59.230]  I might not ever be able to get out of this.
[26:59.230 --> 27:00.290]  Is it the blowhole or the suckhole?
[27:01.810 --> 27:03.170]  Gavin, you might be suck.
[27:05.270 --> 27:05.990]  There you go.
[27:06.950 --> 27:07.570]  I didn't get him.
[27:08.190 --> 27:08.430]  Damn.
[27:09.490 --> 27:09.890]  Damn.
[27:10.170 --> 27:10.810]  Nick's in the lead.
[27:11.810 --> 27:12.170]  What?
[27:12.670 --> 27:13.030]  Oh.
[27:13.350 --> 27:14.010]  Oh, I am.
[27:14.070 --> 27:14.670]  I did kill someone.
[27:14.910 --> 27:15.850]  That was really close.
[27:17.050 --> 27:17.870]  Green got me right there.
[27:19.830 --> 27:20.550]  I killed myself.
[27:20.710 --> 27:20.790]  I didn't even get the crit.
[27:20.810 --> 27:22.090]  There's the dodger.
[27:22.870 --> 27:23.510]  Oh, no!
[27:24.790 --> 27:25.150]  Oh.
[27:25.150 --> 27:27.950]  That moment of realization comes up quick.
[27:34.160 --> 27:35.600]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[27:35.780 --> 27:36.940]  There you go.
[27:37.480 --> 27:38.060]  I got him.
[27:38.440 --> 27:39.280]  No, he died.
[27:40.020 --> 27:41.220]  Andrew committed suicide.
[27:42.560 --> 27:47.240]  I don't know if we're going to be able to complete the kills in this without...
[27:47.240 --> 27:47.400]  Oh!
[27:47.400 --> 27:47.740]  Yeah, no kidding.
[27:48.180 --> 27:50.460]  Oh, I killed you.
[27:51.340 --> 27:51.780]  How'd you die?
[27:52.560 --> 27:55.060]  I ran into your line like every other kill.
[27:55.380 --> 27:56.840]  It was like three inches long.
[27:57.760 --> 27:58.120]  Okay.
[27:58.840 --> 28:00.920]  I don't know why you gotta be mean about it.
[28:02.580 --> 28:02.760]  Shit.
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.280]  It's not like he can help it.
[28:06.520 --> 28:07.920]  Yeah, it was more being mean to myself.
[28:13.840 --> 28:16.060]  I don't like a quiet Gavin's being.
[28:16.140 --> 28:16.780]  Oh, I don't like that.
[28:17.040 --> 28:17.960]  Oh, I don't like that.
[28:18.040 --> 28:18.840]  Oh, I don't like that!
[28:23.340 --> 28:24.680]  Every place is bad.
[28:25.360 --> 28:26.520]  And then I fucking hit a wall.
[28:27.680 --> 28:30.480]  I made a judgment call and then changed my mind halfway through.
[28:30.700 --> 28:31.780]  Poor judgment.
[28:33.160 --> 28:33.980]  You've chosen.
[28:35.240 --> 28:36.080]  Oh, purple.
[28:36.520 --> 28:37.240]  Oh, purple.
[28:39.460 --> 28:39.960]  Yes!
[28:40.620 --> 28:41.980]  I feel like I need to get on a line.
[28:43.540 --> 28:45.980]  Why does the jump suck?
[28:48.320 --> 28:49.760]  Albert, Gavin's a bitch.
[28:50.820 --> 28:51.620]  That might be true.
[28:51.840 --> 28:53.980]  Did they change the shittiness of the jump?
[28:54.860 --> 28:55.300]  Oh, shit!
[28:55.300 --> 28:56.140]  Oh, God!
[28:56.500 --> 28:56.900]  No!
[28:59.760 --> 29:01.280]  I think you just aren't...
[29:01.280 --> 29:02.080]  Oh, shit!
[29:02.260 --> 29:02.760]  ...as good as...
[29:02.760 --> 29:03.640]  What are you thinking?
[29:04.600 --> 29:06.200]  Oh, I turned back and didn't see it.
[29:07.040 --> 29:08.660]  Straight up, what are you thinking?
[29:09.540 --> 29:10.020]  Hey, are you dropping?
[29:11.040 --> 29:12.120]  Oh, I didn't even see you.
[29:12.700 --> 29:13.640]  Die, you piece of shit!
[29:13.640 --> 29:15.460]  There you go, you got this one right here. Nice and easy.
[29:16.460 --> 29:17.680]  Nice and easy.
[29:17.900 --> 29:19.340]  You got your boost now. Watch it.
[29:19.340 --> 29:19.820]  Well, shit!
[29:22.080 --> 29:23.200]  There's nothing you can do there.
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.580]  No, I was headed straight for the double trap.
[29:26.400 --> 29:28.800]  You might as fucking die at some point, Gavin.
[29:29.580 --> 29:32.560]  I think you're in my loop now.
[29:32.840 --> 29:37.260]  Okay, I really can't get out. I don't know what I'm going to do.
[29:38.520 --> 29:40.500]  Can someone help?
[29:42.100 --> 29:43.740]  I'm in a really ugly, tight loop.
[29:44.440 --> 29:46.000]  It's a real race to the bottom.
[29:50.360 --> 29:52.540]  I locked it in some shrubs. Where are the shrubs?
[29:52.540 --> 29:53.240]  There you go, you got him.
[29:53.560 --> 29:54.160]  I got him!
[29:54.400 --> 29:57.380]  And then, don't worry, you eliminated it with a suicide.
[29:57.780 --> 29:58.480]  Hey, you know what?
[29:59.400 --> 30:00.340]  Good work, bud.
[30:00.860 --> 30:03.060]  I went fast and go slow, or something.
[30:03.060 --> 30:05.280]  Oh my god, I keep driving into the same wall!
[30:05.940 --> 30:06.820]  Every time!
[30:07.480 --> 30:08.320]  I missed that completely.
[30:08.320 --> 30:10.220]  You've died nine million times!
[30:10.480 --> 30:10.780]  Fuck! Double!
[30:14.920 --> 30:17.720]  I don't know, every time I see the pink approach me.
[30:17.900 --> 30:18.540]  Oh, that's weird.
[30:18.820 --> 30:19.520]  I hesitate.
[30:19.900 --> 30:20.460]  This game's ludicrous.
[30:21.940 --> 30:23.360]  You hesitate in the pink?
[30:23.520 --> 30:24.480]  Yeah, definitely.
[30:24.860 --> 30:27.500]  When I see that pink hovering towards me, I hesitate.
[30:32.180 --> 30:33.340]  There you go, you got it.
[30:33.380 --> 30:35.020]  No! Every time!
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.140]  There you go.
[30:36.380 --> 30:40.420]  I get an ability and I'm so happy, and then you just cross my line.
[30:41.220 --> 30:42.800]  Jesus, Nick, you just bullied me.
[30:43.300 --> 30:44.980]  How did you live through that?
[30:46.960 --> 30:48.660]  How did you survive it, Geoff?
[30:49.440 --> 30:51.160]  I did it! I fucking died!
[30:51.220 --> 30:51.580]  Yeah, you died on your own.
[30:51.580 --> 30:53.460]  You knocked me into a wall, and then I died.
[30:53.540 --> 30:54.660]  Yeah, but it didn't count as a kill for Nick.
[30:54.660 --> 30:56.240]  I got a suicide for it, yeah.
[30:57.620 --> 30:58.420]  Oh, Andrew!
[30:58.960 --> 30:59.620]  Flippin' L.
[31:00.960 --> 31:01.900]  Back on the board.
[31:02.100 --> 31:02.260]  Paint the ceiling.
[31:03.380 --> 31:03.820]  Oh god.
[31:04.080 --> 31:05.180]  Gavin's up to eight?
[31:06.260 --> 31:06.660]  Michelangelo?
[31:09.560 --> 31:10.160]  Oh, shit.
[31:10.160 --> 31:10.360]  Nick!
[31:11.360 --> 31:12.800]  Oh, he finally did it!
[31:13.360 --> 31:15.600]  I got Gavin! I got my white whale!
[31:15.840 --> 31:16.440]  The pink one.
[31:21.490 --> 31:22.530]  Alright, here we go.
[31:22.950 --> 31:23.670]  Feelin' confident.
[31:26.430 --> 31:27.510]  Into a wall.
[31:27.870 --> 31:28.530]  Nope. Nope.
[31:30.150 --> 31:32.710]  You're right, Gavin. It really does make you play aggressive.
[31:33.410 --> 31:34.570]  Compared to the other way of playing.
[31:34.650 --> 31:36.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:36.450 --> 31:38.450]  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[31:38.550 --> 31:38.710]  Okay.
[31:40.630 --> 31:40.970]  Nope.
[31:41.750 --> 31:42.490]  You gotta turn that shit on.
[31:42.790 --> 31:44.170]  I still have not picked up a-
[31:44.170 --> 31:44.330]  Shit.
[31:46.010 --> 31:49.450]  Again, I don't get it with Gavin. You just see him and you go,
[31:49.450 --> 31:49.990]  Eh, it's fine.
[31:49.990 --> 31:51.990]  I hesitate. I freeze up. I freeze up.
[31:52.090 --> 31:53.190]  I don't understand.
[31:53.750 --> 31:55.310]  I get whiskey dick. I don't know what's going on.
[31:57.210 --> 31:58.950]  Gavin gives Nick whiskey dick.
[31:59.070 --> 31:59.310]  It's true.
[31:59.770 --> 32:00.190]  That's interesting to know.
[32:00.450 --> 32:01.970]  It does have a really flaccid-lookin' line.
[32:02.870 --> 32:03.850]  Struggling to get out.
[32:04.090 --> 32:05.230]  Then I drove out the door.
[32:06.370 --> 32:06.770]  Hop!
[32:06.950 --> 32:07.290]  Oh!
[32:07.410 --> 32:08.610]  You lied when you weren't real!
[32:08.750 --> 32:10.910]  Oh, I killed myself because you weren't real yet!
[32:14.230 --> 32:15.930]  No way! What a hop!
[32:16.150 --> 32:16.930]  Oh, wow.
[32:16.930 --> 32:20.130]  Oh, he's right on top of you.
[32:20.130 --> 32:21.610]  Oh, he's right on top of you.
[32:21.690 --> 32:22.730]  Pink dick! Whiskey dick!
[32:26.790 --> 32:27.750]  The water!
[32:27.970 --> 32:28.250]  Oh no!
[32:30.530 --> 32:34.530]  Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my god. That was so close.
[32:36.370 --> 32:36.910]  Gavin's at eight.
[32:36.910 --> 32:37.310]  Pew!
[32:37.730 --> 32:38.070]  Bitch.
[32:39.610 --> 32:40.530]  Gavin's at eight.
[32:41.390 --> 32:41.870]  Nine.
[32:42.990 --> 32:44.150]  Gavin's at nine!
[32:44.590 --> 32:46.430]  Oh, shit. I won't be the last one.
[32:46.430 --> 32:47.550]  Nick, don't let it be you.
[32:47.790 --> 32:48.230]  What color is Nick?
[32:48.430 --> 32:48.710]  Orange.
[32:49.310 --> 32:50.470]  Nick, don't let it be you.
[32:50.910 --> 32:51.370]  Come here, orange.
[32:51.450 --> 32:52.350]  Nick, don't let it be you.
[32:52.550 --> 32:54.350]  Don't play with my pud, you son of a bitch.
[32:54.390 --> 32:55.110]  Revenge kill!
[32:55.930 --> 32:56.750]  You did it.
[32:56.950 --> 32:57.270]  You...
[32:57.270 --> 32:58.310]  Oh my god.
[32:58.490 --> 32:59.270]  How did you...
[32:59.270 --> 32:59.550]  Nick.
[33:02.150 --> 33:02.910]  I don't know, man.
[33:03.310 --> 33:03.650]  I don't know.
[33:04.110 --> 33:04.470]  I don't know.
[33:04.610 --> 33:05.670]  I must have had some sugar.
[33:09.370 --> 33:11.250]  Must have had a pretty big chunk of water there.
[33:12.710 --> 33:13.670]  Just gave it to you.
[33:13.730 --> 33:14.110]  That's it.
[33:16.050 --> 33:16.490]  Loser.
[33:18.750 --> 33:20.890]  We didn't get that one with the tubes.
[33:21.370 --> 33:22.170]  The tubes.
[33:22.250 --> 33:24.270]  We'll do the tubes another time.
[33:24.390 --> 33:24.750]  That's fine.
[33:24.930 --> 33:30.030]  That was great.
[33:30.550 --> 33:35.810]  Guys, we're a Grand Theft Auto gameplay channel now, so stay tuned for more Grand Theft Auto gameplay.
[33:37.950 --> 33:39.830]  The thing that you think you can escape...
[33:39.830 --> 33:40.250]  There'll be one more.
[33:40.410 --> 33:41.110]  Yeah, one more for now.
[33:41.110 --> 33:42.210]  We should play GTA 1.
[33:42.810 --> 33:43.690]  Oh, you're a maniac.
[33:43.690 --> 33:44.370]  There's...
[33:44.370 --> 33:45.730]  Yeah, we can watch Andrew play it.
[33:45.830 --> 33:46.230]  Alright.
[33:46.430 --> 33:47.130]  Go to free mode, please.
[33:47.290 --> 33:50.610]  So guys, go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[33:50.890 --> 33:52.110]  Subscribe to us.
[33:52.330 --> 33:53.410]  Check out our stuff.
[33:53.730 --> 33:57.410]  We have the two channels, the regulation podcast and regulation gameplay channels on YouTube.
[33:57.930 --> 34:03.190]  Tell a friend about the podcast and let them know about this video where we are still playing Grand Theft Auto.
[34:03.870 --> 34:04.870]  You thought it went away.
[34:04.970 --> 34:05.350]  It's back.
[34:05.730 --> 34:06.590]  And stronger than ever.
[34:07.370 --> 34:10.410]  Any final thoughts from anyone before we end this video?
[34:11.310 --> 34:12.810]  Yeah, you know what I was thinking would be fun?
[34:12.810 --> 34:19.450]  If you have like a group of friends, tell some of them about the podcast YouTube channel, but others about the gameplay channel.
[34:19.510 --> 34:19.870]  That's a good idea.
[34:19.990 --> 34:23.530]  Be sure not to let them know and then just watch and see if it's confusing.
[34:23.870 --> 34:31.250]  If you have any friends who stopped watching Achievement Hunter like eight or nine years ago, let them know how sad it is that we're still doing it.
[34:33.430 --> 34:35.290]  Hey, do you guys remember Achievement Hunter?
[34:35.430 --> 34:36.730]  Oh, the guys who used to play Grand Theft Auto?
[34:36.870 --> 34:38.190]  Yeah, they're still doing it.
[34:38.210 --> 34:38.810]  They're back.
[34:38.950 --> 34:39.710]  They're not dead yet.
[34:39.710 --> 34:44.450]  There's less of them now, and I don't recognize a bunch of them, but they're still going.
[34:45.150 --> 34:47.070]  Dude, it's Geoff.
[34:48.090 --> 34:48.990]  It's Gavin.
[34:49.370 --> 34:51.270]  It's Andy Blanchard, I think.
[34:51.570 --> 34:53.110]  And two other guys I've never seen.
[34:53.750 --> 34:57.250]  And Michael sounds a little weird, but it's clearly still him.
[34:59.890 --> 35:02.270]  And Nick, you still have to be Scott the Engineer, I'm afraid.
[35:02.390 --> 35:02.930]  Oh, no.
[35:03.030 --> 35:04.090]  Let's play.
[35:04.270 --> 35:04.670]  Bye.
[35:04.790 --> 35:05.150]  Bye.
