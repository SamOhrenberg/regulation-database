[00:01.780 --> 00:03.780]  This isn't the heist jewel, is it?
[00:04.000 --> 00:04.820]  I don't think so.
[00:04.940 --> 00:07.500]  This can't be the right thing. This is not the right thing.
[00:09.900 --> 00:10.700]  Andrew, damn!
[00:10.980 --> 00:12.900]  Got randomly texted this, and I was like, whatever.
[00:13.960 --> 00:16.780]  So we never should have even been anywhere near the casino?
[00:17.040 --> 00:19.660]  No! We were supposed to do the cutscene.
[00:20.140 --> 00:22.700]  That was a new mission, I think, in between.
[00:23.720 --> 00:25.540]  We're in the middle of a mission right now.
[00:25.720 --> 00:28.660]  That I just accepted via text, but I don't think it's what we need to do.
[00:28.660 --> 00:30.520]  I'm accepting missions in the middle of a mission!
[00:30.860 --> 00:32.060]  What the fuck are you doing?
[00:32.060 --> 00:35.000]  I'm doing an audio, I asked, what are we supposed to be doing?
[00:35.180 --> 00:36.300]  And you guys said, I don't know.
[00:36.420 --> 00:38.660]  You can't go in here.
[00:38.880 --> 00:40.760]  Okay, well then we gotta go to the music store.
[00:41.120 --> 00:42.740]  Why the fuck would you go over there?
[00:43.100 --> 00:44.340]  Why did you leave me?
[00:44.420 --> 00:46.660]  Because I got a music store to go to.
[00:46.840 --> 00:47.620]  Eric, get in the minivan.
[00:47.980 --> 00:48.680]  Okay, I'm coming.
[00:48.700 --> 00:49.740]  I'm at the music store.
[00:50.020 --> 00:50.220]  Okay.
[00:50.620 --> 00:52.260]  Oh, I'm supposed to kill these guys!
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.840]  A thief is fleeing with the DJ equipment.
[00:55.100 --> 00:56.540]  We'll be there eventually.
[00:56.540 --> 00:59.100]  Me and Gavin are in a Honda Odyssey.
