[00:00.000 --> 00:06.960]  We are playing Makeway. I'm very excited because this is going to be a very screamy game.
[00:07.480 --> 00:13.740]  A very screamy game. Uh, we recorded a video that'll be out later of us playing this game,
[00:13.740 --> 00:17.920]  but when we were like, are we doing a stream this week? What three-player game? I just said
[00:17.920 --> 00:22.120]  Makeway and immediately was like, let's fucking do it. Yeah, this is great. I can't wait. All
[00:22.120 --> 00:28.220]  right. Are you guys ready to get into Makeway? All right. It's just the three of us waiting on
[00:28.220 --> 00:32.840]  Thank you guys for being here. We're on the road to 501. What do you mean? Huh?
[00:33.160 --> 00:35.680]  Now you can get rid of like the little logo because it's not there anymore.
[00:36.480 --> 00:40.520]  Oh, Grandpa Joe's pumpkin truck. What color are we going to do today?
[00:40.960 --> 00:44.520]  I have a new car. Check this out. You got a new car? Look at that.
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.960]  What is that? That's the mammoth, baby.
[00:47.680 --> 00:50.300]  Holy shit, dude. Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talking about.
[00:51.180 --> 00:52.420]  Well, I guess I'm going green pumpkin.
[00:54.920 --> 00:56.700]  Sorry, man. You gotta make way, baby.
[00:56.700 --> 00:59.680]  I forced your hand. OK, so if you've never seen this game,
[00:59.800 --> 01:04.720]  we found it and it is ultimate chicken horse meets racing.
[01:06.060 --> 01:08.280]  It's awesome. That's what it is. You build the track
[01:08.280 --> 01:12.900]  each round like we start with that. Yep. And then he's going to put a little bit of that.
[01:13.460 --> 01:15.280]  But what do you put there? Some of this action.
[01:15.820 --> 01:18.440]  Oh, no. Yeah, it's a raising and lowering bridge.
[01:20.020 --> 01:21.840]  OK. Oh, that's a new one.
[01:21.840 --> 01:24.600]  Yeah, that is one that I've unlocked. That's fun.
[01:25.740 --> 01:29.460]  Oh, dude, that's my honk. Oh, no.
[01:29.480 --> 01:32.640]  You got me completely turned around. Fucking Christ.
[01:32.740 --> 01:34.100]  Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[01:35.540 --> 01:36.880]  Get him, Nick. Get him, Nick.
[01:36.940 --> 01:38.540]  No! Eat shit, Eric.
[01:42.480 --> 01:43.360]  God damn it.
[01:56.900 --> 01:58.580]  Oh, I can't place that there. Damn it.
[01:58.720 --> 02:02.080]  So what you compare this to like ultimate chicken horse with cars.
[02:02.420 --> 02:05.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like ultimate chicken horse meets excite bike.
[02:06.160 --> 02:07.720]  Yes. I love it.
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.240]  When you described it as what excite bike wishes it was, you're totally right.
[02:13.360 --> 02:16.700]  Dude, what just happened? How is Geoff the only one alive?
[02:16.980 --> 02:18.800]  Geoff booked all the points is what happened.
[02:18.940 --> 02:20.540]  And don't worry, I'll find you back.
[02:22.600 --> 02:23.740]  OK, here we go.
[02:23.840 --> 02:25.160]  Oh, you motherfuckers.
[02:25.380 --> 02:25.760]  Later, idiots.
[02:26.660 --> 02:28.680]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.860]  This supports up to four players, if you're wondering.
[02:34.900 --> 02:39.200]  It's just that our other players aren't here today.
[02:39.560 --> 02:43.240]  So yeah, I'm just eating fucking little butt nuggets.
[02:43.740 --> 02:44.620]  It's true. You are.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.940]  Wait, how did you get first place?
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.200]  I crossed it first.
[02:48.780 --> 02:51.360]  Oh, I guess I bull shit.
[02:51.640 --> 02:52.900]  All right, get this right here.
[02:53.040 --> 02:53.580]  Fuck you.
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.300]  I'm pretty where you see that.
[02:55.660 --> 02:56.120]  Yeah, go to.
[02:57.500 --> 02:58.860]  All right, go to hell.
[02:58.900 --> 02:59.440]  You got to loop it.
[02:59.960 --> 03:00.420]  There you go.
[03:00.460 --> 03:02.500]  All right, guys.
[03:02.580 --> 03:03.540]  They don't know what's happening.
[03:05.340 --> 03:05.660]  Yep.
[03:07.700 --> 03:09.020]  Oh, wow.
[03:15.340 --> 03:15.860]  No!
[03:19.100 --> 03:19.600]  Machine gun.
[03:19.800 --> 03:20.740]  That's the sound of the police.
[03:21.220 --> 03:21.740]  Wahoo!
[03:22.100 --> 03:23.060]  You little bitch.
[03:23.240 --> 03:24.740]  How did I die?
[03:25.000 --> 03:25.360]  That's right.
[03:25.440 --> 03:26.260]  Nobody finishes.
[03:30.020 --> 03:32.780]  Yeah, no kidding.
[03:33.360 --> 03:34.400]  Oh, my game crashed.
[03:34.680 --> 03:35.100]  What's going on?
[03:35.540 --> 03:38.300]  Your game crashed?
[03:38.620 --> 03:39.440]  My game actually crashed.
[03:39.880 --> 03:40.180]  I don't know.
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.500]  Oh, you know what?
[03:42.360 --> 03:42.620]  Really?
[03:43.320 --> 03:43.580]  Yeah.
[03:44.820 --> 03:45.320]  Oh, no.
[03:45.580 --> 03:45.860]  Come back.
[03:45.960 --> 03:49.160]  Yeah, if not, we'll just start another one.
[03:49.200 --> 03:49.780]  Don't worry about it.
[03:49.780 --> 03:51.180]  I don't think you're coming back, buddy.
[03:51.380 --> 03:51.780]  Goodbye.
[03:53.260 --> 03:54.400]  Oh, you're alive.
[03:54.500 --> 03:55.360]  Geoff, you're alive.
[03:55.740 --> 03:56.500]  I'm alive?
[03:58.220 --> 03:59.020]  How am I doing?
[03:59.680 --> 04:00.600]  Hold the gas.
[04:00.780 --> 04:01.540]  Hit the gas, Geoff.
[04:01.580 --> 04:02.120]  Hit the gas.
[04:04.040 --> 04:04.840]  Go left.
[04:05.100 --> 04:05.380]  Back up.
[04:05.640 --> 04:06.060]  Go left.
[04:08.660 --> 04:09.500]  God damn it.
[04:09.760 --> 04:10.520]  Hang on, hang on.
[04:10.560 --> 04:11.160]  We'll see what happens.
[04:11.540 --> 04:12.760]  Maybe you'll spawn back in here.
[04:12.820 --> 04:13.680]  It said no one finished.
[04:13.680 --> 04:15.220]  Did you spawn back in or no?
[04:15.620 --> 04:16.800]  No, my game's pinwheeling.
[04:17.100 --> 04:17.800]  Okay, uh, okay.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.180]  I'm gonna fucking go time machine.
[04:19.340 --> 04:20.180]  I'm gonna...
[04:20.180 --> 04:21.120]  Okay, why don't you mix it up?
[04:21.360 --> 04:21.780]  Mix it up.
[04:22.420 --> 04:25.600]  I've been trying to deliver pumpkins this whole fucking time.
[04:25.900 --> 04:28.200]  And maybe somebody else can deliver a pumpkin once in a while.
[04:28.260 --> 04:29.440]  Yeah, might be the way to do it.
[04:29.500 --> 04:30.780]  All right, let's pick our tracks.
[04:31.640 --> 04:32.040]  Oh.
[04:33.220 --> 04:33.620]  Yeah.
[04:34.100 --> 04:34.360]  Cool.
[04:35.700 --> 04:36.240]  All right.
[04:36.440 --> 04:36.780]  Yeah.
[04:37.040 --> 04:39.000]  Oh, what a shitty way to start.
[04:40.280 --> 04:40.680]  Great.
[04:41.660 --> 04:42.680]  Oh, you suck.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Eric, you son of a bitch.
[04:46.040 --> 04:46.940]  What's wrong?
[04:47.640 --> 04:50.620]  Look out for the fan.
[04:51.220 --> 04:52.580]  Oh my god.
[04:52.580 --> 04:52.960]  Oh, we lived.
[04:53.300 --> 04:53.860]  For now.
[04:54.640 --> 04:55.280]  Eric's out.
[04:55.700 --> 04:57.500]  Oh my god.
[04:57.840 --> 05:01.640]  Little Geoffy's got a big win under his belt.
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.640]  Little Geoffy has points.
[05:05.320 --> 05:06.280]  We'll have points.
[05:06.440 --> 05:06.740]  Wow.
[05:07.080 --> 05:07.960]  You're gonna be first place.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.400]  And let's stop.
[05:10.780 --> 05:11.200]  All right.
[05:13.560 --> 05:17.200]  Watch me win the 2024 tournament.
[05:17.480 --> 05:18.260]  This was it.
[05:18.720 --> 05:20.160]  This was essentially our Super Bowl.
[05:20.620 --> 05:24.540]  Everything from this point on is just consider it like the All-Pro game.
[05:24.740 --> 05:25.760]  We're just goofing around.
[05:26.660 --> 05:32.080]  I'm so tired of the discourse of NBA viewership is down.
[05:32.280 --> 05:32.860]  What's the reason?
[05:33.140 --> 05:34.740]  Everyone goes, they're shooting too many three-pointers.
[05:35.080 --> 05:38.780]  Everyone watches illegal streams.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.020]  Like, what are you talking about?
[05:40.640 --> 05:42.560]  Yeah, because it's so hard to watch anywhere else now.
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.180]  I got news for you.
[05:43.220 --> 05:45.500]  The NBA is as popular as it's ever been.
[05:45.520 --> 05:47.180]  Just nobody pays for it.
[05:47.400 --> 05:47.880]  Exactly.
[05:48.320 --> 05:49.580]  That's all it is.
[05:50.460 --> 05:53.500]  Also, for people that say that there's no fucking defense in the NBA,
[05:53.540 --> 05:54.940]  they're not watching the NBA.
[05:55.520 --> 05:56.000]  No.
[05:57.300 --> 05:57.780]  Absolutely.
[05:58.480 --> 05:58.860]  Yes.
[06:00.340 --> 06:01.520]  I just think there's...
[06:01.520 --> 06:03.960]  Honestly, I think there's too many games in a season.
[06:03.980 --> 06:05.540]  No, I killed myself.
[06:05.680 --> 06:06.220]  Oh, way to go, man.
[06:06.400 --> 06:08.580]  I reluctantly agree.
[06:08.580 --> 06:13.580]  I think that a lot of people want to reduce it to a 70-game season,
[06:13.920 --> 06:16.760]  and I hate it because I want more, but...
[06:16.760 --> 06:18.760]  Yeah, I mean, it's never going to happen.
[06:18.860 --> 06:21.600]  Well, clearly, there's a couple things going on.
[06:21.800 --> 06:26.820]  The season's too long so that nobody cares about regular season games,
[06:27.140 --> 06:28.640]  or they don't care as much as they used to.
[06:29.040 --> 06:33.660]  And players are playing at such a level that their bodies are breaking down.
[06:33.740 --> 06:34.080]  Yes.
[06:35.140 --> 06:37.160]  And that is a frustrating...
[06:37.160 --> 06:37.320]  Oh, God.
[06:37.320 --> 06:40.020]  I bitched about this on my podcast a while back.
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.240]  That is a frustrating thing as an NBA fan,
[06:42.580 --> 06:47.540]  is you feel like half of the stars of the league are injured or on minutes restrictions.
[06:47.880 --> 06:50.400]  Any random night of the week.
[06:50.580 --> 06:53.760]  But that's why I think that's why so many games is a detriment,
[06:53.960 --> 06:57.260]  because it is minutes restrictions and load management.
[06:57.500 --> 06:57.860]  Absolutely.
[06:59.000 --> 06:59.520]  But you know what?
[06:59.520 --> 07:03.600]  I also think there's been an issue with just finding the broadcast this year.
[07:03.720 --> 07:04.480]  Like, I know there's...
[07:04.480 --> 07:06.240]  Oh, God, that's the biggest...
[07:06.240 --> 07:07.200]  No, that's the biggest issue.
[07:07.320 --> 07:10.920]  The biggest issue is that I don't know where to watch it.
[07:11.480 --> 07:14.660]  And that's insane for me, because sports are the most normie thing.
[07:14.680 --> 07:15.440]  We talked about this.
[07:15.820 --> 07:18.140]  Sports are like the most normie thing in the world.
[07:18.300 --> 07:23.580]  And the fact that I have to Google where I watch a game for anything is insane.
[07:23.960 --> 07:25.240]  That's absolute lunacy.
[07:26.160 --> 07:27.720]  It is so fucking...
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.840]  It's wild, too, because the NFL is doing better than any other sport right now.
[07:31.900 --> 07:32.200]  Big surprise.
[07:32.200 --> 07:37.980]  But they are navigating the current media landscape exceptionally well.
[07:38.560 --> 07:39.780]  And you got to watch...
[07:39.780 --> 07:43.220]  If you want to follow the NFL as just like a blanket NFL fan,
[07:43.440 --> 07:50.040]  you got to have TV, some sort of a YouTube live or Hulu with live TV or one of those.
[07:50.280 --> 07:52.860]  Then you have to have Peacock and you have to have Amazon.
[07:53.340 --> 07:54.580]  It's fucking ridiculous.
[07:55.080 --> 07:56.440]  Yes, it's hard.
[07:57.560 --> 08:00.460]  I just feel bad for my dad who doesn't want to think about that.
[08:00.520 --> 08:01.840]  He just wants to watch the game.
[08:01.840 --> 08:04.640]  Yeah, you know, I just...
[08:05.280 --> 08:06.280]  I just picked up...
[08:08.360 --> 08:09.900]  What are you doing?
[08:10.460 --> 08:11.440]  I'm fucking this over.
[08:11.760 --> 08:16.600]  God help you if you want to watch Victor Wimbenyama play basketball
[08:16.600 --> 08:19.400]  in the state of Texas outside of the city of San Antonio.
[08:19.740 --> 08:20.860]  I found out how to do it, Geoff.
[08:21.200 --> 08:22.380]  I found out how to do it.
[08:22.440 --> 08:29.320]  You have to get a fan or a FanDuel Sports Network account.
[08:29.500 --> 08:31.100]  Yeah, pay $20 a month.
[08:32.280 --> 08:37.060]  And then hope that they don't put the game on Ken's 5 in San Antonio
[08:37.060 --> 08:39.300]  on a local station down there for that night.
[08:39.800 --> 08:41.680]  So that's how I did it last year.
[08:41.840 --> 08:43.680]  But last year it was Bally Sports Network.
[08:43.960 --> 08:43.980]  Yeah.
[08:45.400 --> 08:46.660]  I mean, they're bankrupt.
[08:47.000 --> 08:47.020]  Yeah.
[08:47.700 --> 08:48.760]  So this year it's...
[08:48.760 --> 08:50.860]  And it was bullshit because as soon as I paid for it,
[08:50.900 --> 08:52.560]  I started not getting access to games.
[08:52.660 --> 08:53.700]  Suddenly they were...
[08:53.700 --> 08:55.340]  It is a real fucking nightmare.
[08:55.540 --> 09:00.480]  And that's why you go to Stream East or Crack Streams
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.940]  like that's why ratings are down.
[09:03.060 --> 09:04.200]  It's like, I'm just going to watch it illegally.
[09:04.340 --> 09:05.160]  Get real.
[09:05.860 --> 09:07.620]  I'm not going to fucking deal with that shit.
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.200]  I happily pay for NBA League Pass and I watch it a lot.
[09:15.500 --> 09:19.760]  But even that, like, it's perfect for me because I'm a Celtics fan
[09:19.760 --> 09:21.060]  and I can watch every...
[09:21.060 --> 09:22.960]  I don't... I never have to worry about blackouts.
[09:23.140 --> 09:26.280]  But even with NBA League Pass, I cannot watch Spurs games,
[09:26.440 --> 09:28.440]  which is a blessing because I hate the Spurs.
[09:28.440 --> 09:31.660]  But I want to watch... I want to watch Wimby, goddammit.
[09:32.000 --> 09:32.140]  Yeah.
[09:32.560 --> 09:33.800]  Nick, I think your mouse is on screen.
[09:34.600 --> 09:35.000]  Oh, it is?
[09:36.000 --> 09:36.420]  Oh, well.
[09:36.740 --> 09:37.160]  I'm so embarrassed.
[09:37.320 --> 09:38.520]  Just move it off to the side.
[09:39.020 --> 09:39.260]  I did.
[09:39.440 --> 09:40.520]  Just move it. I was going to say don't click.
[09:40.520 --> 09:41.320]  So gross of you.
[09:41.440 --> 09:42.020]  God, this is a...
[09:42.020 --> 09:43.380]  In front of the audience, they saw it.
[09:43.480 --> 09:44.100]  This is getting insane.
[09:44.100 --> 09:44.920]  I had to click back into the game.
[09:46.880 --> 09:49.920]  To that point, and we've talked a little bit about this before too,
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.820]  but you almost have to be a fan of a team in another market to actually watch them.
[09:54.820 --> 09:57.840]  I'm a Padres fan, and so I'm able to watch them.
[09:58.900 --> 09:59.600]  MLB network.
[09:59.600 --> 10:01.780]  MLB network or MLB TV thing.
[10:01.860 --> 10:06.740]  And I can just watch the Padres as long as they don't play the Astros or the Rangers.
[10:07.080 --> 10:07.740]  Oh, yeah.
[10:07.920 --> 10:12.580]  They're on Apple TV or they're not on TNT or ESPN or...
[10:12.580 --> 10:12.920]  Or Paramount.
[10:13.060 --> 10:13.400]  Exactly.
[10:13.780 --> 10:14.620]  So stupid.
[10:14.940 --> 10:15.600]  Why'd I die?
[10:15.800 --> 10:16.240]  Goddammit.
[10:16.840 --> 10:19.800]  Hey, hey, hey, guys, cutting the cable is going to save us all money.
[10:20.200 --> 10:20.980]  Oh, man.
[10:20.980 --> 10:24.320]  I wish I could go back in time and shake myself for bitching about the cable.
[10:25.220 --> 10:25.640]  Stop it.
[10:25.740 --> 10:26.160]  Stop it.
[10:26.360 --> 10:27.100]  U-verse, stay.
[10:27.320 --> 10:27.620]  Goddammit.
[10:27.620 --> 10:29.540]  I so bought into that.
[10:29.680 --> 10:31.500]  Gus and I were such big advocates of that shit.
[10:32.440 --> 10:36.580]  I mean, at the time, and honestly, it could have been, it just became everybody was like,
[10:36.620 --> 10:38.000]  hey, we can make a lot more money on this.
[10:38.140 --> 10:38.240]  Yes, absolutely.
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.220]  We just were fucking naive and didn't understand that big business was going to find a way to
[10:43.220 --> 10:44.660]  get their pound of flesh and money.
[10:45.080 --> 10:45.160]  Yeah.
[10:46.420 --> 10:47.020]  Oh, my God.
[10:47.320 --> 10:49.700]  There would be no altruism involved.
[10:49.840 --> 10:50.420]  No, no.
[10:50.420 --> 10:50.920]  Why would there be?
[10:51.120 --> 10:51.400]  Yeah.
[10:52.680 --> 10:53.880]  I was in my 20s.
[10:54.120 --> 10:56.160]  I didn't have a concept of that.
[10:56.160 --> 10:56.560]  Yep.
[10:56.720 --> 10:57.340]  First place, baby.
[10:57.740 --> 10:58.680]  Blackouts should be illegal.
[10:58.860 --> 10:59.620]  Absolutely agree.
[11:00.460 --> 11:01.340]  Yeah, I agree.
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.980]  Think Congress should break up the monopoly on Major League Baseball.
[11:05.520 --> 11:06.480]  OK, well, that's not going to happen.
[11:06.620 --> 11:07.500]  No, but I want it.
[11:08.520 --> 11:10.520]  Nick is in third place.
[11:10.720 --> 11:11.560]  Geoff is in first.
[11:11.660 --> 11:12.340]  This sucks.
[11:12.580 --> 11:13.920]  Let's not call attention to it.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.620]  Well, now that I've seen it, it must be undone.
[11:16.920 --> 11:17.540]  Yes, hopefully.
[11:18.420 --> 11:19.040]  Oh, nice.
[11:19.340 --> 11:19.960]  Insane placement.
[11:20.180 --> 11:21.440]  These are tough.
[11:21.820 --> 11:23.060]  These are so crazy.
[11:23.060 --> 11:26.120]  Oh, my God.
[11:27.320 --> 11:28.400]  God, I love this game.
[11:28.920 --> 11:30.340]  It is a fun game.
[11:30.420 --> 11:31.760]  And there's other game modes we can try, too.
[11:31.840 --> 11:33.720]  I saw chaos mode and...
[11:33.720 --> 11:34.440]  Yeah, I saw that.
[11:34.620 --> 11:35.180]  Something else.
[11:35.660 --> 11:36.280]  Oh, I think it's me.
[11:36.480 --> 11:36.540]  Ah!
[11:37.200 --> 11:37.600]  No!
[11:37.640 --> 11:38.420]  Oh, I killed his mom!
[11:39.720 --> 11:40.920]  Nick the Bastard Man.
[11:41.780 --> 11:42.160]  Ah!
[11:43.160 --> 11:43.560]  Ugh.
[11:44.840 --> 11:45.620]  God damn it.
[11:48.220 --> 11:52.200]  Yeah, mods should get some bets going on who's going to win.
[11:52.680 --> 11:53.040]  Probably not.
[11:53.600 --> 11:57.540]  Probably not on this one because it's going to be, you know, Geoff, but...
[11:59.960 --> 12:00.360]  Oh, wow.
[12:00.720 --> 12:01.920]  Maybe Eric makes his big comeback.
[12:02.140 --> 12:02.760]  Maybe daddy's back.
[12:02.940 --> 12:04.020]  Maybe this is it right here.
[12:04.260 --> 12:05.380]  Maybe daddy comes back here.
[12:05.860 --> 12:06.440]  Oh, dear.
[12:08.920 --> 12:09.360]  Easy.
[12:09.740 --> 12:10.120]  Scary.
[12:10.820 --> 12:11.180]  Whee!
[12:13.440 --> 12:15.580]  All right, daddy makes his comeback here.
[12:15.780 --> 12:16.200]  Here we go.
[12:17.860 --> 12:18.580]  Here we go.
[12:18.980 --> 12:20.320]  All right, let's go, Mammoth.
[12:21.340 --> 12:21.960]  Here we go.
[12:22.060 --> 12:22.600]  Nice and easy.
[12:23.040 --> 12:23.720]  Nice and easy.
[12:23.820 --> 12:24.320]  Very scared.
[12:24.560 --> 12:24.900]  Very nervous.
[12:25.100 --> 12:26.040]  You're your own worst enemy here.
[12:26.080 --> 12:26.480]  Absolutely.
[12:27.980 --> 12:28.380]  Oh!
[12:28.980 --> 12:30.340]  What? You guys took my power.
[12:30.560 --> 12:31.200]  What the fuck?
[12:31.580 --> 12:32.600]  Well, it's what we do.
[12:32.640 --> 12:33.440]  No, you're killing me!
[12:33.840 --> 12:34.040]  Ah!
[12:34.920 --> 12:36.200]  We're power vampires.
[12:36.540 --> 12:37.400]  It's true. I've seen it.
[12:38.620 --> 12:39.500]  Okay, here we go.
[12:39.760 --> 12:39.980]  All right.
[12:40.400 --> 12:40.800]  Nick's back.
[12:40.880 --> 12:41.240]  Go to hell.
[12:42.040 --> 12:42.860]  You son of a bitch!
[12:43.880 --> 12:45.040]  How did I not get a power?
[12:45.200 --> 12:45.640]  What the...
[12:45.640 --> 12:46.040]  Ah!
[12:46.400 --> 12:47.280]  Okay, still in it.
[12:47.980 --> 12:48.380]  Oh.
[12:49.960 --> 12:51.040]  Oh, dropping mines.
[12:54.360 --> 12:55.220]  Oh, my God.
[12:55.280 --> 12:57.740]  This is a fucking battle, dude.
[12:57.980 --> 12:58.680]  Oh, this is crazy.
[12:59.120 --> 12:59.960]  Not like this.
[13:00.080 --> 13:01.140]  Oh, we're so locked in.
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.100]  We're so locked in.
[13:02.100 --> 13:02.840]  What happened to me?
[13:02.860 --> 13:03.600]  Where'd I go?
[13:04.000 --> 13:04.540]  How did I...
[13:04.540 --> 13:05.640]  Ah, what the fuck?
[13:05.900 --> 13:06.360]  Geoff is gone.
[13:06.440 --> 13:06.840]  Geoff is gone.
[13:06.920 --> 13:07.360]  Geoff is gone.
[13:07.700 --> 13:08.100]  No!
[13:08.540 --> 13:10.120]  And you're gone, too, motherfucker.
[13:11.160 --> 13:12.440]  Oh, I should have saved it for the end.
[13:15.640 --> 13:16.040]  No!
[13:16.600 --> 13:16.960]  Yes!
[13:17.940 --> 13:19.180]  You might have pushed me into it.
[13:19.540 --> 13:20.160]  Come on.
[13:20.360 --> 13:20.860]  Come on.
[13:21.120 --> 13:21.820]  Come on.
[13:21.820 --> 13:23.620]  Oh, Geoff, well...
[13:23.620 --> 13:24.560]  It's first to 4,000.
[13:25.660 --> 13:26.700]  Okay, 4,000.
[13:27.000 --> 13:27.300]  Finishing.
[13:28.000 --> 13:28.460]  And stop.
[13:28.900 --> 13:29.280]  No!
[13:30.280 --> 13:32.020]  How did Geoff get first?
[13:32.320 --> 13:33.440]  Because I'm the best.
[13:34.260 --> 13:36.460]  I'm the captain race a lot.
[13:39.740 --> 13:41.860]  Get ready to throw that image back up on the screen next.
[13:41.860 --> 13:45.140]  Oh, my God.
[13:46.140 --> 13:49.600]  Hey, happy Christmas to all of you in the audience that are saying shit about Christmas.
[13:50.440 --> 13:51.180]  Are we talking about Christmas?
[13:52.540 --> 13:54.000]  Happy, happy holidays.
[13:54.760 --> 13:55.280]  Hell yeah.
[13:57.040 --> 13:58.280]  Happy holidays, everybody.
[13:58.400 --> 13:58.900]  Oh, here we go.
[13:59.080 --> 14:00.260]  Prediction started.
[14:00.500 --> 14:01.760]  The mods are here.
[14:02.140 --> 14:06.500]  Guys, the prediction is who will win first to 4,000 points here.
[14:06.580 --> 14:07.540]  That's going to be the next one.
[14:07.600 --> 14:10.680]  Okay, we are going to play again.
[14:10.760 --> 14:12.140]  We're going to do the same game mode.
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.380]  This bet is going to get started here in just a second.
[14:15.880 --> 14:18.400]  As soon as Geoff gets in here, we're going to...
[14:18.400 --> 14:19.680]  Sorry, I'm looking at all my unlocks.
[14:20.800 --> 14:21.880]  It's a lot, right?
[14:21.960 --> 14:22.340]  It's pretty good.
[14:23.260 --> 14:24.720]  Well, when you do as well as I did, yeah.
[14:25.080 --> 14:25.940]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[14:27.020 --> 14:28.680]  Guys, it's time to get your bets in.
[14:29.700 --> 14:31.520]  Throw down on who you think it's going to be.
[14:31.660 --> 14:33.100]  For some reason, I'm in first.
[14:33.180 --> 14:33.740]  That's great.
[14:34.820 --> 14:35.960]  Because that's who's going to win.
[14:36.100 --> 14:39.100]  And it's important for you to get this money.
[14:39.480 --> 14:39.880]  That's great.
[14:40.160 --> 14:40.180]  It's me.
[14:40.660 --> 14:41.280]  I'm going to win.
[14:41.660 --> 14:43.260]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[14:44.420 --> 14:46.580]  Anyway, I'm going to get back on the mammoth.
[14:46.680 --> 14:47.980]  Well, I'm going to do a different colored mammoth.
[14:48.040 --> 14:48.560]  I like this.
[14:48.560 --> 14:49.760]  I think the mammoth.
[14:49.860 --> 14:54.680]  I'm going to be the yellow lightning all-access car.
[14:55.040 --> 14:55.820]  Yeah, what is that?
[14:55.840 --> 14:56.680]  You should call it the Homer.
[14:57.120 --> 14:58.480]  Yeah, really, no kidding.
[14:59.800 --> 15:02.720]  Oh, yeah, it is kind of like the car Homer designed.
[15:04.020 --> 15:04.740]  The Homer.
[15:05.700 --> 15:06.700]  Oh, I got this.
[15:06.800 --> 15:07.800]  I got this round and round.
[15:08.020 --> 15:08.620]  This is going to be a good one.
[15:09.100 --> 15:10.080]  Oh, look at this bitch.
[15:10.560 --> 15:12.240]  Was that Danny DeVito who played his brother?
[15:12.520 --> 15:13.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:13.980 --> 15:14.640]  I believe it.
[15:14.700 --> 15:15.340]  I believe it was.
[15:15.760 --> 15:16.600]  Oh, God.
[15:16.800 --> 15:18.980]  This is a twisty, turny beginning.
[15:19.260 --> 15:19.800]  Oh, no.
[15:19.880 --> 15:20.620]  Oh, boy.
[15:20.860 --> 15:21.920]  Oh, no.
[15:22.260 --> 15:23.200]  All right, boys, get locked in.
[15:23.800 --> 15:24.820]  We're going to be in this forever.
[15:25.080 --> 15:25.580]  You know what, though?
[15:25.580 --> 15:26.280]  No fans.
[15:26.680 --> 15:27.080]  That's nice.
[15:27.340 --> 15:28.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:29.180 --> 15:29.820]  Just give it time.
[15:30.200 --> 15:31.080]  Get a couple of walls, a couple of jumps.
[15:31.080 --> 15:32.080]  Dude, I'm in a fucking micro machine.
[15:32.240 --> 15:33.180]  This thing is tiny.
[15:33.540 --> 15:33.760]  Yeah.
[15:36.100 --> 15:38.140]  How did I not get anything there?
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.320]  Oh, I killed you.
[15:40.920 --> 15:42.360]  You son of a bitch.
[15:42.420 --> 15:43.380]  You kill me right at the end, too.
[15:43.460 --> 15:44.780]  I don't get to start the next round.
[15:44.780 --> 15:45.320]  Yes!
[15:45.320 --> 15:46.220]  That's a motherfucker.
[15:46.940 --> 15:46.980]  Yo!
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.300]  Guys, if you put your money on Eric, you're sitting pretty.
[15:50.760 --> 15:51.720]  Look at that, 550?
[15:51.880 --> 15:53.760]  Let's pump it on up to 650.
[15:54.540 --> 15:55.600]  We're almost there.
[15:55.860 --> 15:56.680]  Might as well just call it.
[15:57.140 --> 15:59.260]  Coffee break says they got 420 on Eric.
[15:59.480 --> 16:02.820]  That's a subtle, subtle drug reference.
[16:02.980 --> 16:03.760]  It's pretty good.
[16:03.960 --> 16:06.600]  Probably wouldn't know it, but it is.
[16:06.840 --> 16:07.600]  Yes, okay.
[16:07.700 --> 16:08.340]  What is that?
[16:08.420 --> 16:09.500]  I just unlocked this piece.
[16:09.600 --> 16:10.760]  It's called the freeway.
[16:11.220 --> 16:11.500]  Uh-oh.
[16:12.100 --> 16:12.660]  Uh-oh.
[16:12.700 --> 16:13.860]  Yeah, uh-oh's right.
[16:14.780 --> 16:16.020]  I'm ready for the freeway.
[16:17.480 --> 16:18.080]  Oh, yeah.
[16:18.080 --> 16:20.300]  Are you gonna watch the NFL Simpsons broadcast?
[16:20.660 --> 16:22.280]  Yeah, I'm very excited about it.
[16:22.360 --> 16:24.620]  I think so.
[16:24.860 --> 16:27.700]  I don't think I'm excited, but I'm gonna watch it.
[16:27.760 --> 16:28.240]  I'm excited.
[16:28.380 --> 16:29.540]  I watched the Nickelodeon ones.
[16:29.600 --> 16:30.140]  They're pretty cute.
[16:30.460 --> 16:31.400]  They're cute, yeah.
[16:32.040 --> 16:34.920]  I've been out to watch the whole game, but I'll watch it for like, you know, two, three minutes.
[16:34.980 --> 16:36.140]  You guys bullied me so hard.
[16:36.220 --> 16:37.180]  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[16:37.500 --> 16:38.340]  Oh my god.
[16:38.340 --> 16:38.620]  Ah!
[16:40.180 --> 16:45.880]  I, uh, last night watching the Lions game on Amazon
[16:45.880 --> 16:48.340]  and I remember that they have that, like, Enhanced View.
[16:48.500 --> 16:48.600]  Ah!
[16:49.480 --> 16:51.680]  So I turned it on and it's like watching Madden.
[16:51.800 --> 16:52.200]  It's crazy.
[16:52.480 --> 16:53.460]  I like the Enhanced View.
[16:53.540 --> 16:54.000]  It's pretty cool.
[16:54.360 --> 16:55.440]  Yeah, I think I was into it.
[16:55.540 --> 16:55.880]  I enjoyed it.
[16:56.440 --> 17:00.440]  I like when they put a red ring around, like, the Defender they think is gonna rush the passer
[17:00.440 --> 17:01.140]  and that kind of stuff.
[17:01.180 --> 17:01.540]  That's neat.
[17:01.960 --> 17:02.380]  It is.
[17:02.500 --> 17:03.160]  I like it a lot.
[17:03.520 --> 17:05.040]  Um, I'm gonna go with this one.
[17:05.400 --> 17:05.760]  Oh.
[17:06.460 --> 17:06.940]  We're gonna go.
[17:06.940 --> 17:09.360]  We haven't put any hazards in yet, which is nice.
[17:09.900 --> 17:13.060]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What a hell hole.
[17:13.120 --> 17:15.360]  Hang on. Dude, I've been enjoying... No, let's go this way.
[17:15.620 --> 17:19.720]  I like NFL a lot, but college football this year for me has been tops.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.780]  It has been like upset after upset.
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.000]  It's because UT is winning.
[17:24.060 --> 17:26.640]  Well, OK, let's... Yeah, let's... I did bury the lead.
[17:26.900 --> 17:29.820]  But UT number two right now, right behind Oregon, is that right?
[17:29.840 --> 17:31.160]  Yeah, right behind Oregon.
[17:31.260 --> 17:32.300]  Oregon's the only undefeated.
[17:32.600 --> 17:35.780]  It has been an interesting year where so many teams were number one briefly,
[17:35.780 --> 17:37.240]  including Alabama. Yep.
[17:38.080 --> 17:38.840]  And Texas.
[17:39.340 --> 17:40.560]  Ah, I blew myself up.
[17:41.220 --> 17:42.780]  Oh, Nick. Oh, man.
[17:43.260 --> 17:45.580]  Way to go in a short time to get there.
[17:46.020 --> 17:47.300]  Oh, God.
[17:49.820 --> 17:50.140]  Goo!
[17:50.820 --> 17:51.700]  Oh, I gooed myself.
[17:52.440 --> 17:54.200]  Oh, God. Get gooed.
[17:54.900 --> 17:57.620]  Oh, no, don't shoot me.
[17:57.760 --> 17:58.500]  Oh, my God.
[18:01.020 --> 18:01.840]  Eric, please.
[18:02.020 --> 18:03.600]  Big turn, big turn, big turn, big turn.
[18:04.180 --> 18:04.720]  I have a family.
[18:05.180 --> 18:05.800]  I have a family.
[18:05.960 --> 18:06.820]  Your family can go to hell.
[18:07.100 --> 18:07.680]  I did it, I did it.
[18:08.060 --> 18:08.880]  Wow, that's weird.
[18:08.900 --> 18:10.900]  How are you still in this, Geoff?
[18:10.940 --> 18:11.680]  I don't know.
[18:11.820 --> 18:13.100]  I have... Oh, I'm not.
[18:13.720 --> 18:15.420]  I fucking opened my mouth.
[18:15.420 --> 18:15.540]  Yes, there we go.
[18:16.940 --> 18:17.380]  Woohoo!
[18:18.280 --> 18:18.820]  That's OK.
[18:18.900 --> 18:20.720]  That's like the first one that I got.
[18:21.060 --> 18:22.480]  Like, oh, Nick has to be in first.
[18:23.500 --> 18:23.920]  Oof.
[18:24.540 --> 18:26.180]  Finish. First place.
[18:26.340 --> 18:26.900]  There we go.
[18:27.840 --> 18:28.600]  Sixteen hundred.
[18:29.320 --> 18:31.440]  How's those bets feeling right now, gang?
[18:34.060 --> 18:36.580]  How's your subtle drug references now, gang?
[18:37.020 --> 18:37.180]  Yeah.
[18:37.720 --> 18:38.760]  Oh, yeah, going downtown.
[18:39.240 --> 18:40.440]  Oh, that's going to suck.
[18:40.860 --> 18:41.220]  Yep.
[18:43.320 --> 18:44.180]  Oh, what are you doing?
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.400]  Speaking of downtown, guess who has a permanent residency at Branson, Missouri?
[18:49.880 --> 18:50.680]  Petulia Clark.
[18:51.120 --> 18:51.260]  Yeah.
[18:51.380 --> 18:52.420]  Oh, I thought you were going to say...
[18:52.420 --> 18:54.600]  Oh, I definitely thought you were about to say you.
[18:55.080 --> 18:56.260]  No, I was thinking about that song.
[18:56.880 --> 18:57.320]  Downtown.
[18:57.320 --> 18:57.880]  Downtown.
[19:00.680 --> 19:02.140]  You're a Branson guy, dude.
[19:02.880 --> 19:05.000]  It's just the most recent thing I've done.
[19:06.380 --> 19:07.960]  Which makes me a Branson guy.
[19:08.020 --> 19:09.840]  I'm a Branson guy like I'm a Key West guy.
[19:09.940 --> 19:10.360]  Exactly.
[19:10.760 --> 19:13.660]  Welcome to me after every single vacation I ever take.
[19:13.900 --> 19:14.640]  God, the freeway.
[19:14.700 --> 19:15.240]  I should move here.
[19:15.440 --> 19:18.460]  God damn the fucking freeway.
[19:18.800 --> 19:19.540]  I should move here.
[19:19.720 --> 19:20.180]  I should move here.
[19:20.660 --> 19:21.060]  God damn it.
[19:21.060 --> 19:21.480]  There we go.
[19:21.740 --> 19:24.020]  That's a sucky butthole of a turn there.
[19:25.080 --> 19:25.860]  There we go.
[19:27.820 --> 19:28.840]  Come on.
[19:28.840 --> 19:30.000]  Oh my god.
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.760]  You bullied me so hard.
[19:32.080 --> 19:34.200]  You bullied me so hard.
[19:34.440 --> 19:35.700]  Are you sure you've only won once?
[19:36.040 --> 19:38.960]  I think it's this little fucking dork of a car I am.
[19:39.080 --> 19:40.740]  Don't be this car.
[19:42.120 --> 19:42.920]  There we go.
[19:43.700 --> 19:45.520]  Yellow lightning was a mistake.
[19:47.180 --> 19:48.300]  There we go.
[19:48.460 --> 19:49.040]  Get it going.
[19:49.360 --> 19:50.040]  A little higher.
[19:51.100 --> 19:51.580]  Keep me going.
[19:52.200 --> 19:52.780]  What?
[19:53.340 --> 19:54.560]  There's some shit right here.
[19:54.600 --> 19:54.940]  What?
[19:56.260 --> 19:57.060]  Yeah, buddy.
[19:57.320 --> 19:57.560]  Oh, come on.
[19:58.080 --> 20:00.100]  That's your Mario Party at work right there.
[20:00.740 --> 20:02.660]  Oh, I want the seesaw. Do we both get the seesaw?
[20:02.980 --> 20:04.020]  Oh, I don't know.
[20:04.520 --> 20:04.900]  Cool.
[20:05.120 --> 20:05.760]  No, who took...
[20:05.760 --> 20:06.300]  What did I get?
[20:06.300 --> 20:08.160]  What is a Tesla coil?
[20:08.740 --> 20:09.080]  Oh.
[20:09.220 --> 20:09.940]  What does that do?
[20:10.440 --> 20:10.800]  We have to know.
[20:10.800 --> 20:11.680]  What are you doing?
[20:13.100 --> 20:15.420]  No, not on the...
[20:15.420 --> 20:15.900]  I don't know.
[20:15.900 --> 20:16.460]  That can't be good.
[20:16.660 --> 20:17.740]  I don't know what it does.
[20:17.900 --> 20:18.700]  You suck.
[20:19.060 --> 20:19.780]  It's gotta be a magnet.
[20:20.680 --> 20:22.820]  Do you think that's what a Tesla coil does?
[20:22.920 --> 20:24.340]  Is that it attracts things?
[20:24.720 --> 20:25.080]  It might.
[20:25.320 --> 20:25.760]  I don't know.
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.640]  I know what a real Tesla coil does.
[20:27.700 --> 20:28.220]  But you fuck!
[20:28.660 --> 20:30.140]  No one did anything to you.
[20:30.220 --> 20:30.900]  You did that.
[20:31.340 --> 20:32.320]  No, no, no.
[20:32.500 --> 20:33.460]  Are you yelling at yourself there?
[20:33.940 --> 20:34.260]  Yes.
[20:34.440 --> 20:34.680]  Maybe.
[20:35.060 --> 20:36.040]  Land on the...
[20:36.040 --> 20:36.320]  I'm alive.
[20:36.880 --> 20:38.200]  I'm on the wrong...
[20:38.200 --> 20:38.380]  Go!
[20:42.940 --> 20:43.400]  Freeway!
[20:43.800 --> 20:45.940]  Dude, this little dork of a car.
[20:45.960 --> 20:46.180]  Yes.
[20:46.340 --> 20:47.680]  You bully so hard.
[20:48.880 --> 20:50.220]  Geoff, every time...
[20:50.220 --> 20:50.440]  No!
[20:54.740 --> 20:57.060]  I want my time machine back.
[20:59.560 --> 21:02.160]  I want to take a time machine back to when I was good.
[21:02.320 --> 21:03.040]  Oh, man.
[21:03.120 --> 21:03.340]  What?
[21:04.540 --> 21:06.400]  Geoff is still in this thing.
[21:07.120 --> 21:08.120]  Oh, you suck.
[21:08.840 --> 21:09.720]  It did nothing.
[21:10.080 --> 21:10.800]  It did nothing.
[21:15.180 --> 21:16.300]  Oh, fuck.
[21:19.480 --> 21:20.500]  Oh, my God.
[21:20.500 --> 21:21.300]  Oh, my God.
[21:21.440 --> 21:21.880]  Oh, Nick.
[21:21.880 --> 21:22.580]  I'm about to get him bullied.
[21:23.080 --> 21:24.660]  There's nothing I can do to defend myself.
[21:28.500 --> 21:29.600]  Hold on to your butts.
[21:29.660 --> 21:29.980]  No!
[21:30.220 --> 21:30.600]  What is this?
[21:30.620 --> 21:31.380]  Oh, it's the see-saw.
[21:31.480 --> 21:31.860]  You bullied me?
[21:32.280 --> 21:33.480]  Ah, I hit the Tesla coil.
[21:33.660 --> 21:34.540]  Nah, I paid for it.
[21:34.800 --> 21:35.140]  Ah!
[21:35.860 --> 21:36.240]  Ah!
[21:37.900 --> 21:38.660]  Nick sucks.
[21:39.180 --> 21:40.560]  No, I hit the Tesla coil.
[21:41.720 --> 21:43.420]  You fucking loser.
[21:43.980 --> 21:44.620]  All right.
[21:45.720 --> 21:46.660]  Let's calm down here.
[21:46.660 --> 21:49.200]  I'm definitely going to lose this race, but you lost.
[21:49.320 --> 21:49.860]  Oh, fuck.
[21:50.220 --> 21:51.260]  I lost the lotteries.
[21:51.320 --> 21:52.100]  Oh, it's mine, Eric!
[21:52.100 --> 21:52.800]  What the fuck?
[21:53.000 --> 21:53.360]  Yeah!
[21:58.620 --> 22:00.600]  He's going to pull ahead here.
[22:02.440 --> 22:02.940]  Yep.
[22:03.800 --> 22:04.300]  Wow!
[22:06.220 --> 22:06.720]  Yes.
[22:07.380 --> 22:07.620]  Ouch.
[22:08.640 --> 22:08.900]  Good.
[22:09.640 --> 22:10.140]  Give me that.
[22:10.980 --> 22:11.560]  Give me that.
[22:14.040 --> 22:14.540]  What?
[22:14.960 --> 22:15.140]  Oh.
[22:18.900 --> 22:20.440]  I wish I could switch my car.
[22:20.620 --> 22:22.400]  Why can't I change my loadout like in Call of Duty?
[22:22.540 --> 22:23.760]  Oh, what are you doing, man?
[22:24.080 --> 22:25.220]  Getting you started.
[22:26.600 --> 22:28.660]  Ooh, somebody tried to tell me there's food at the end of the race.
[22:28.780 --> 22:28.960]  Go!
[22:30.480 --> 22:30.840]  Ah!
[22:31.720 --> 22:34.840]  Oh, that makes you go haywire.
[22:34.980 --> 22:35.140]  Okay.
[22:35.320 --> 22:36.180]  Oh, is that what it is?
[22:36.580 --> 22:36.820]  Yeah.
[22:37.460 --> 22:38.300]  If you touch it.
[22:39.040 --> 22:39.660]  Well, don't touch it.
[22:40.520 --> 22:40.800]  Okay.
[22:42.080 --> 22:42.740]  Bye, idiot.
[22:42.920 --> 22:43.660]  I'm on the track still.
[22:44.300 --> 22:45.060]  Hey, you...
[22:45.060 --> 22:45.840]  Ah, you bitch.
[22:46.840 --> 22:47.560]  Fly off!
[22:48.700 --> 22:49.260]  Freeway!
[22:50.440 --> 22:51.000]  Freeway!
[22:53.220 --> 22:54.480]  Geoff made it!
[22:54.620 --> 22:54.960]  Finally.
[22:57.160 --> 22:57.560]  Geoff, please.
[22:59.260 --> 23:00.520]  Geoff, please.
[23:01.180 --> 23:02.740]  How did you survive that?
[23:03.240 --> 23:03.880]  I don't know.
[23:03.940 --> 23:04.440]  What does that do?
[23:04.540 --> 23:05.540]  Oh, a big car!
[23:06.100 --> 23:06.860]  Big car!
[23:09.060 --> 23:09.940]  Oh, you dick.
[23:09.940 --> 23:11.400]  Geoff is slinging it!
[23:12.360 --> 23:12.720]  Ah!
[23:13.480 --> 23:13.800]  Yes!
[23:14.020 --> 23:14.800]  Oh, I bounced.
[23:14.900 --> 23:15.580]  I bounced hard.
[23:15.860 --> 23:16.820]  My tires worked!
[23:16.820 --> 23:18.640]  I love the tires.
[23:20.440 --> 23:21.440]  There we go.
[23:22.820 --> 23:24.600]  Little Geoffy, you're the one.
[23:24.700 --> 23:25.420]  Come on.
[23:25.560 --> 23:26.320]  Taking turns.
[23:26.760 --> 23:27.000]  Oh no!
[23:27.000 --> 23:27.680]  So much fun!
[23:28.060 --> 23:29.260]  Falling off the edge.
[23:29.440 --> 23:30.720]  You fucking suck!
[23:34.860 --> 23:36.760]  Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me!
[23:36.960 --> 23:37.180]  Ow!
[23:39.740 --> 23:40.620]  Come on.
[23:41.480 --> 23:42.200]  What the f-
[23:42.200 --> 23:42.820]  Yeah!
[23:43.080 --> 23:44.140]  Nick might have just got it.
[23:44.460 --> 23:44.840]  Oh.
[23:44.840 --> 23:45.880]  No, I don't think so.
[23:45.880 --> 23:46.820]  I think he just-
[23:47.160 --> 23:48.180]  I died so much.
[23:48.720 --> 23:49.720]  But you got first place.
[23:49.940 --> 23:51.860]  Oh, it's gonna be a runoff.
[23:52.400 --> 23:53.260]  It's gonna be a runoff.
[23:54.080 --> 23:54.400]  Yes!
[23:54.620 --> 23:55.020]  Oh no!
[23:57.540 --> 23:58.700]  No sudden death.
[23:58.820 --> 24:01.180]  Let's play a game and get me out of this fucking car.
[24:01.500 --> 24:01.800]  Woo!
[24:02.240 --> 24:02.480]  Woo!
[24:03.100 --> 24:03.180]  Woo!
[24:04.920 --> 24:05.240]  No!
[24:05.800 --> 24:07.060]  You guys wanna play the same game type?
[24:07.120 --> 24:07.160]  Yes.
[24:07.160 --> 24:08.100]  Or do you want me to turn on chaos?
[24:09.660 --> 24:09.980]  Yes.
[24:10.180 --> 24:10.920]  Let's see what chaos is.
[24:10.920 --> 24:11.540]  One more for real.
[24:12.380 --> 24:13.760]  You wanna do one more of this, Nick?
[24:13.780 --> 24:14.560]  And then you wanna do chaos?
[24:14.560 --> 24:15.380]  Yeah!
[24:15.920 --> 24:16.140]  Okay.
[24:16.760 --> 24:17.080]  Okay.
[24:17.540 --> 24:18.260]  I'm down for it now.
[24:18.340 --> 24:18.480]  Whatever.
[24:18.780 --> 24:20.920]  That one's for the piss rats out there.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.040]  Big rats in the chat.
[24:22.220 --> 24:22.900]  What's up, rats?
[24:24.420 --> 24:25.400]  Pay no attention to that.
[24:26.280 --> 24:29.240]  And just use my Eric emotes in chat.
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.320]  Now we're doing good.
[24:31.840 --> 24:32.220]  Ooh!
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.120]  Geoff, I just-
[24:33.120 --> 24:36.260]  Ooh, I'm about to unlock a very cool looking little car, but not yet.
[24:36.640 --> 24:37.900]  Don't use it.
[24:38.100 --> 24:38.620]  Little's bad.
[24:41.100 --> 24:41.460]  Okay.
[24:42.120 --> 24:42.960]  Waiting on Geoff.
[24:43.320 --> 24:44.640]  And then we'll, uh...
[24:44.640 --> 24:45.800]  Alright, here we go, guys.
[24:45.960 --> 24:47.320]  Geoff, don't pick that same car.
[24:47.780 --> 24:48.940]  I gotta go with the Mammoth, though.
[24:49.080 --> 24:49.220]  Good call.
[24:49.420 --> 24:49.800]  Good call.
[24:50.660 --> 24:52.200]  Do I wanna...
[24:52.200 --> 24:52.920]  Ooh, silver graze.
[24:55.280 --> 24:55.640]  Yeah.
[24:56.160 --> 24:56.520]  Yeah.
[24:56.760 --> 24:57.680]  I'll go back to my original.
[24:57.920 --> 24:58.280]  Okay.
[24:58.640 --> 25:00.200]  Guys, let's get another bet going.
[25:00.680 --> 25:02.180]  Let's get another bet open right now.
[25:02.240 --> 25:03.300]  Win some more, uh...
[25:03.300 --> 25:04.040]  What do we call it here?
[25:04.060 --> 25:04.480]  Rat coin?
[25:04.640 --> 25:05.260]  No, that's my thing.
[25:05.340 --> 25:05.880]  What's this?
[25:07.000 --> 25:07.360]  Uh...
[25:07.360 --> 25:08.000]  What's it called here?
[25:08.000 --> 25:08.580]  Oh, that is your thing.
[25:08.600 --> 25:09.200]  Yeah, it is.
[25:09.280 --> 25:10.200]  I just don't know what it's called here.
[25:10.780 --> 25:11.140]  Points?
[25:11.640 --> 25:12.280]  Regulation points.
[25:12.740 --> 25:12.920]  Austin?
[25:12.920 --> 25:13.600]  That makes a lot of sense.
[25:14.520 --> 25:15.460]  Oh, oh, put it on.
[25:15.540 --> 25:15.820]  Goddammit.
[25:16.220 --> 25:16.980]  Oh, that sucks.
[25:18.180 --> 25:18.760]  Do this one.
[25:18.840 --> 25:19.060]  Ooh.
[25:19.120 --> 25:19.580]  Oh, man.
[25:19.700 --> 25:20.460]  Regulation points.
[25:21.040 --> 25:21.700]  Regulation points.
[25:22.000 --> 25:22.200]  Yeah.
[25:22.340 --> 25:22.840]  Not Bitcoin.
[25:23.000 --> 25:23.440]  Rat coin.
[25:24.900 --> 25:25.520]  Red coin.
[25:26.200 --> 25:26.620]  Oh, God.
[25:26.860 --> 25:27.460]  Oh, God.
[25:28.560 --> 25:29.280]  They're NNFTs.
[25:29.440 --> 25:30.600]  They're not NFTs.
[25:30.920 --> 25:31.100]  Yeah.
[25:33.360 --> 25:33.720]  NNFTs.
[25:35.740 --> 25:36.480]  Okay, here we go.
[25:37.060 --> 25:37.620]  Here we go.
[25:37.620 --> 25:38.920]  That's first place.
[25:39.120 --> 25:39.560]  That's first.
[25:39.700 --> 25:43.560]  If you put your rat coin on, Eric, you gotta be feeling good, guys.
[25:44.160 --> 25:45.960]  Yeah, that's your non-non-fungible right there.
[25:46.120 --> 25:46.380]  Yup.
[25:47.160 --> 25:47.580]  Non-non.
[25:47.940 --> 25:48.760]  Ooh, give me that one.
[25:48.800 --> 25:49.940]  No, I wanted the corkscrew.
[25:49.940 --> 25:51.360]  Great, now I want Indian food for dinner.
[25:52.040 --> 25:52.280]  Ooh.
[25:52.360 --> 25:52.760]  Ooh.
[25:53.720 --> 25:54.120]  You know what?
[25:54.140 --> 25:54.720]  I wanna go down.
[25:55.420 --> 25:56.960]  I like the down on the corkscrew.
[25:57.060 --> 25:57.320]  It's fun.
[25:58.760 --> 26:00.320]  Like Petunia Clark goes...
[26:00.820 --> 26:01.220]  Downtown.
[26:02.480 --> 26:05.860]  Twice a night, every night, six nights a week in Branson, Missouri.
[26:06.100 --> 26:06.900]  God.
[26:08.720 --> 26:09.400]  Ah, shit.
[26:14.780 --> 26:16.760]  We're just holding on.
[26:17.360 --> 26:19.880]  It's nice not to be little anymore, but I still suck.
[26:20.320 --> 26:20.920]  Yeah, it's true.
[26:21.000 --> 26:21.620]  I've seen it.
[26:23.320 --> 26:24.100]  Way to go, Nick.
[26:24.500 --> 26:25.000]  I landed.
[26:25.560 --> 26:26.220]  No, I landed.
[26:26.220 --> 26:26.380]  Doesn't matter.
[26:26.540 --> 26:27.320]  Game don't care.
[26:27.400 --> 26:27.780]  I landed too.
[26:27.780 --> 26:29.100]  You did not land.
[26:31.100 --> 26:32.780]  In this game, ball do lie.
[26:37.970 --> 26:40.190]  Tried to cut the corner and it didn't work.
[26:41.090 --> 26:41.590]  Oh, my.
[26:42.510 --> 26:44.370]  Oh, my is right, baby.
[26:44.950 --> 26:45.570]  Look at you.
[26:46.110 --> 26:46.410]  Woo!
[26:46.610 --> 26:47.470]  First place, guys.
[26:47.510 --> 26:48.150]  A thousand points.
[26:48.210 --> 26:49.450]  I'm already a quarter of the way there.
[26:49.610 --> 26:50.470]  This is easy street.
[26:50.810 --> 26:51.830]  I'm getting creamed.
[26:52.290 --> 26:52.950]  Yeah, you are.
[26:53.890 --> 26:54.030]  What?
[26:55.510 --> 26:56.550]  Easy street.
[26:58.450 --> 27:00.950]  I wanna live a easy...
[27:01.510 --> 27:04.430]  You ever see that sitcom, Easy Street?
[27:05.350 --> 27:05.970]  That's the song?
[27:05.970 --> 27:08.090]  I recognize it.
[27:08.090 --> 27:08.270]  Easy Street.
[27:10.710 --> 27:11.250]  Look out!
[27:12.870 --> 27:13.830]  No, no.
[27:13.990 --> 27:14.370]  Look out!
[27:18.050 --> 27:21.530]  Dude, if you're not playing this game, what are you doing with your life?
[27:21.550 --> 27:22.810]  God, this game is so good.
[27:22.970 --> 27:23.330]  No!
[27:23.610 --> 27:24.510]  Guys, don't worry.
[27:24.630 --> 27:27.330]  If you're here, only the people on the track can talk right now.
[27:27.390 --> 27:30.110]  Guys, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday.
[27:30.270 --> 27:32.410]  If you're watching this later, we really appreciate you.
[27:32.450 --> 27:34.910]  You wanna be here Friday at 4 p.m. Central.
[27:34.910 --> 27:40.490]  You wanna take us all the way to 5.01, the best time of the week.
[27:40.890 --> 27:41.670]  Of da week.
[27:42.830 --> 27:44.010]  How are you still alive?
[27:44.790 --> 27:45.530]  I live forever.
[27:46.390 --> 27:47.190]  God damn it.
[27:47.310 --> 27:47.490]  No!
[27:47.570 --> 27:47.910]  I'm dead.
[27:48.950 --> 27:49.350]  Tenacity.
[27:49.710 --> 27:50.050]  You time machine!
[27:54.810 --> 27:55.450]  Bastard man.
[27:55.450 --> 27:56.890]  I had to rub it in her face.
[27:59.630 --> 28:01.650]  Wow, that was a lot of points for finishing.
[28:02.590 --> 28:03.790]  You just tied it up.
[28:03.790 --> 28:04.990]  We doubled up Nick, though.
[28:05.510 --> 28:06.250]  Sure did.
[28:07.750 --> 28:12.190]  I gotta get my shhhhhhit together.
[28:12.350 --> 28:12.750]  Yeah, you do.
[28:15.370 --> 28:16.950]  Aw, man.
[28:17.330 --> 28:18.710]  These fucking fans.
[28:18.930 --> 28:19.250]  There we go.
[28:19.350 --> 28:19.970]  That's not gonna be good for business.
[28:19.970 --> 28:20.470]  Why do you...
[28:20.810 --> 28:21.970]  That's the bad place.
[28:22.330 --> 28:22.850]  Yeah, exactly.
[28:25.070 --> 28:26.790]  Nick doesn't need any more challenges.
[28:26.970 --> 28:28.210]  He's already done a couple at a time.
[28:31.750 --> 28:33.070]  Hoisted by my own petard.
[28:33.070 --> 28:34.930]  That's okay, Nick will screw it up.
[28:35.130 --> 28:35.510]  What?
[28:35.830 --> 28:36.690]  It's true, I've seen it.
[28:37.210 --> 28:37.730]  No!
[28:38.230 --> 28:38.710]  Not yet.
[28:39.710 --> 28:40.470]  Not yet.
[28:40.890 --> 28:41.410]  Yet.
[28:49.720 --> 28:51.100]  So much goo!
[28:52.220 --> 28:53.180]  Daddy's big now.
[28:56.100 --> 28:57.140]  Fire it!
[28:57.380 --> 28:58.000]  Oh, Geoff.
[28:58.240 --> 28:58.740]  No, Geoff.
[29:00.240 --> 29:00.440]  No!
[29:04.640 --> 29:05.160]  Yes!
[29:05.160 --> 29:05.920]  Uh.
[29:10.480 --> 29:11.180]  Bye, guys.
[29:11.820 --> 29:12.400]  Where the fuck am I?
[29:12.720 --> 29:13.200]  No!
[29:13.740 --> 29:14.920]  No, time machine!
[29:15.080 --> 29:15.500]  No!
[29:16.820 --> 29:17.300]  No!
[29:18.980 --> 29:19.460]  Yes.
[29:20.200 --> 29:20.500]  Yes.
[29:20.620 --> 29:21.120]  Damn it.
[29:22.740 --> 29:22.800]  Yes.
[29:23.540 --> 29:23.940]  Yes.
[29:24.800 --> 29:26.760]  Oh, Geoff is in first big style.
[29:26.960 --> 29:27.520]  Damn it.
[29:29.800 --> 29:30.220]  Yes.
[29:30.580 --> 29:31.700]  Geoff is not a fan guy.
[29:31.820 --> 29:33.140]  No, Geoff is not a fan guy.
[29:36.180 --> 29:36.660]  Ooh.
[29:36.660 --> 29:37.380]  Ooh.
[29:38.540 --> 29:38.980]  Ooh.
[29:39.660 --> 29:40.100]  Ooh.
[29:40.280 --> 29:40.640]  Yes.
[29:41.380 --> 29:43.560]  I put some Tesla coils down that I shouldn't have put down.
[29:44.120 --> 29:44.700]  Uh-oh.
[29:44.920 --> 29:46.800]  Well, that's probably what Tesla said, too.
[29:48.320 --> 29:49.240]  Come on, come on, come on.
[29:49.300 --> 29:49.800]  Yes, yes, yes.
[29:49.860 --> 29:50.920]  Well, fuck.
[29:52.600 --> 29:55.580]  Be nice if you guys just knocked each other off the map.
[29:55.800 --> 29:56.780]  Ah, ah, big man!
[29:57.080 --> 29:57.920]  Daddy's big now.
[29:58.560 --> 29:59.440]  Fucking shit!
[30:04.620 --> 30:05.240]  Bye, Geoff.
[30:06.140 --> 30:06.980]  Oh, man.
[30:08.300 --> 30:08.900]  That sucked.
[30:09.660 --> 30:10.500]  Yeah, you suck.
[30:11.600 --> 30:13.240]  Oh, man, and I suck.
[30:15.960 --> 30:16.600]  Gotta go.
[30:17.380 --> 30:17.820]  Fellas!
[30:18.300 --> 30:18.640]  Ah!
[30:18.720 --> 30:19.260]  Oh, that sucked.
[30:19.260 --> 30:20.120]  I made it, I made it!
[30:20.460 --> 30:21.260]  Sorry, Geoff.
[30:21.300 --> 30:22.160]  It was meant for Eric.
[30:22.460 --> 30:22.880]  Oh.
[30:23.500 --> 30:25.260]  This bully is not meant for you.
[30:26.660 --> 30:27.920]  But I'll use it regardless.
[30:28.460 --> 30:28.740]  Whee!
[30:29.100 --> 30:29.540]  Whoa!
[30:30.000 --> 30:30.440]  Whoa.
[30:30.440 --> 30:31.120]  Big one.
[30:31.500 --> 30:31.760]  Eric.
[30:32.060 --> 30:32.260]  Damn.
[30:34.000 --> 30:34.700]  Dum-de-dum.
[30:34.720 --> 30:35.300]  Don't blow it.
[30:35.660 --> 30:36.220]  Don't blow it.
[30:36.220 --> 30:37.360]  You're gonna blow it.
[30:39.400 --> 30:40.200]  Get out of here.
[30:40.200 --> 30:40.440]  Get out of here.
[30:40.840 --> 30:40.980]  Ah!
[30:41.540 --> 30:43.140]  Way to go, Nick.
[30:44.360 --> 30:45.160]  Way to go, Nick.
[30:49.300 --> 30:49.900]  Smash him!
[30:50.000 --> 30:50.880]  Smash him to pieces!
[30:50.900 --> 30:51.420]  I think Geoff got it.
[30:51.580 --> 30:53.380]  I think I got it.
[30:53.580 --> 30:54.080]  Did I get it?
[30:54.140 --> 30:55.200]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[30:55.760 --> 30:57.200]  We both got points for finishing.
[30:58.220 --> 30:58.620]  No!
[30:59.300 --> 31:00.100]  Oh, dear.
[31:01.000 --> 31:01.400]  Yes!
[31:01.520 --> 31:01.900]  Comeback bonus.
[31:02.180 --> 31:03.360]  I think you got it.
[31:03.620 --> 31:03.840]  Oh, damn.
[31:03.840 --> 31:04.860]  No, you got first.
[31:04.860 --> 31:05.720]  I got comeback.
[31:06.020 --> 31:07.520]  Oh, the fan, if you insist.
[31:08.020 --> 31:09.000]  Oh, the freeway.
[31:09.180 --> 31:10.480]  I want the freeway.
[31:10.780 --> 31:11.700]  You said you got cummed on?
[31:11.920 --> 31:12.140]  What?
[31:12.720 --> 31:14.460]  Yeah, I got a comeback story.
[31:14.820 --> 31:16.020]  I'll tell you about it on the podcast.
[31:18.780 --> 31:22.140]  It was like that time I rode that shirt and my shirt and the dirty...
[31:23.840 --> 31:24.280]  Oh.
[31:24.500 --> 31:26.200]  The between the episodes story I told you guys.
[31:26.440 --> 31:27.800]  Oh, yeah, that's a good story.
[31:28.600 --> 31:29.040]  Fuck!
[31:29.240 --> 31:29.840]  Bye, idiots.
[31:31.140 --> 31:32.280]  The Tesla coils.
[31:35.720 --> 31:36.200]  No!
[31:37.020 --> 31:39.500]  This fucking swept me right off the floor.
[31:40.660 --> 31:42.400]  Alright, Nick, don't screw it.
[31:42.680 --> 31:43.200]  I won't.
[31:43.260 --> 31:43.640]  We're fine.
[31:43.800 --> 31:44.600]  Don't blow it.
[31:46.060 --> 31:48.240]  Don't blow it like most things in your life.
[31:48.680 --> 31:49.160]  What?
[31:49.800 --> 31:50.760]  That's not true at all.
[31:50.860 --> 31:51.260]  Get out of here.
[31:51.320 --> 31:51.800]  Oh, shit.
[31:53.280 --> 31:53.760]  Oh!
[31:53.780 --> 31:54.480]  Oh, my God.
[31:54.820 --> 31:55.720]  Time machine, you blew it.
[31:55.740 --> 31:58.240]  I got wrapped around the thing.
[32:00.760 --> 32:02.600]  When did that hole get there?
[32:05.320 --> 32:06.460]  Oh, Geoff, you suck!
[32:06.460 --> 32:06.760]  There we go.
[32:07.080 --> 32:07.160]  No!
[32:07.160 --> 32:08.340]  That's how it's done, baby.
[32:08.940 --> 32:09.240]  Bye, Geoff.
[32:09.240 --> 32:10.620]  Oh, that sucks.
[32:10.880 --> 32:12.200]  I am not even...
[32:12.200 --> 32:13.100]  Oh, man.
[32:13.340 --> 32:13.680]  Will you die?
[32:13.680 --> 32:16.400]  This is the falling aparting of Geoff right now.
[32:16.400 --> 32:16.800]  There we go.
[32:17.680 --> 32:19.060]  The Tesla coils!
[32:19.440 --> 32:19.820]  No!
[32:20.160 --> 32:21.220]  Yes, I'm still in it!
[32:25.600 --> 32:26.120]  Please!
[32:26.420 --> 32:26.620]  No!
[32:27.020 --> 32:27.380]  Yeah!
[32:29.420 --> 32:30.880]  You bastard man.
[32:32.320 --> 32:33.800]  Geoff the bastard man.
[32:33.800 --> 32:36.200]  I wasn't going to let you have it all to yourself, buddy.
[32:36.200 --> 32:37.100]  I'm still coiled up!
[32:39.100 --> 32:39.720]  No, no!
[32:39.920 --> 32:40.180]  No!
[32:40.800 --> 32:41.840]  There we go, there we go.
[32:42.040 --> 32:42.700]  We're still in it.
[32:44.360 --> 32:44.800]  No!
[32:45.000 --> 32:45.120]  Yeah!
[32:45.120 --> 32:46.160]  Oh, my God.
[32:46.780 --> 32:48.800]  Guys, whoever put that fan there is a genius.
[32:49.100 --> 32:52.900]  Yeah, that was a real big dick move there.
[32:53.380 --> 32:55.540]  That's a big dick move.
[32:55.560 --> 32:59.760]  Not getting points for killing people with your placement sucks.
[33:00.260 --> 33:02.440]  I should get points for every time you idiots die.
[33:04.480 --> 33:05.120]  Oh, God.
[33:05.240 --> 33:05.920]  The freeway.
[33:06.060 --> 33:07.300]  Oh, this is a mistake to be big.
[33:07.600 --> 33:08.600]  The freeway!
[33:10.480 --> 33:10.800]  Yes!
[33:11.360 --> 33:11.680]  Yes!
[33:12.580 --> 33:12.900]  Woo!
[33:13.540 --> 33:14.580]  I have to be up there.
[33:14.680 --> 33:15.600]  I gotta be at like 35.
[33:15.880 --> 33:17.060]  I gotta be at like 35.
[33:17.600 --> 33:18.240]  Come on.
[33:19.040 --> 33:19.680]  Come on.
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.140]  Okay, first place.
[33:23.500 --> 33:23.820]  3425.
[33:24.000 --> 33:24.500]  I'm so close.
[33:24.600 --> 33:25.220]  Guys, I'm so close.
[33:25.300 --> 33:26.680]  If you put your money on Eric, you must be feeling so good.
[33:26.680 --> 33:27.560]  That's a pretty big lead.
[33:27.780 --> 33:29.000]  Oh, you must be feeling so good.
[33:29.800 --> 33:30.320]  I'm not.
[33:31.600 --> 33:32.900]  Why'd you put your money on Eric?
[33:33.700 --> 33:34.420]  You're Nick.
[33:35.920 --> 33:36.340]  What?
[33:37.560 --> 33:38.660]  I know a ringer.
[33:39.240 --> 33:39.660]  What?
[33:42.220 --> 33:43.200]  Oh, my God.
[33:44.160 --> 33:44.740]  All right.
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.160]  I know what I have to do.
[33:46.500 --> 33:46.700]  Win?
[33:48.180 --> 33:48.600]  Well...
[33:48.600 --> 33:48.880]  What?
[33:49.080 --> 33:49.740]  We have to kill Eric.
[33:50.020 --> 33:50.880]  I'm Tesla'd out.
[33:51.620 --> 33:52.680]  I got double Teslas here.
[33:57.500 --> 33:58.880]  Oh, Nick, I thought you were going.
[33:59.280 --> 34:00.000]  I thought so too.
[34:00.300 --> 34:00.940]  Geoff, slow down!
[34:01.120 --> 34:01.860]  Geoff, keep going.
[34:01.860 --> 34:02.400]  Geoff, slow down!
[34:02.640 --> 34:03.260]  Geoff, faster!
[34:03.660 --> 34:04.340]  Geoff, faster!
[34:05.480 --> 34:06.280]  Ready, Geoff?
[34:06.400 --> 34:06.560]  Ready, Geoff?
[34:06.740 --> 34:07.180]  Geoff, no!
[34:07.180 --> 34:08.060]  Fuck me!
[34:08.440 --> 34:09.320]  Where's your Nick?
[34:10.480 --> 34:11.200]  Hey, shut up.
[34:11.200 --> 34:12.000]  Oh, God.
[34:12.100 --> 34:12.780]  Fuck off!
[34:13.620 --> 34:15.480]  He did himself in with an idiot.
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.400]  No!
[34:17.340 --> 34:19.200]  Oh, he did himself in with an idiot.
[34:21.140 --> 34:22.540]  Nobody did anything.
[34:23.520 --> 34:23.780]  Everyone sucks.
[34:26.640 --> 34:28.880]  Three different examples of terrible.
[34:29.580 --> 34:30.800]  God, this game is so good.
[34:31.280 --> 34:31.580]  No!
[34:31.580 --> 34:31.980]  The hole!
[34:32.320 --> 34:32.820]  No!
[34:35.220 --> 34:36.460]  That damn hole.
[34:37.020 --> 34:37.860]  No, Geoff!
[34:37.960 --> 34:38.520]  No, Geoff!
[34:40.000 --> 34:40.500]  No!
[34:40.680 --> 34:41.240]  Too far!
[34:41.500 --> 34:41.860]  Yes!
[34:42.760 --> 34:43.520]  Damn it.
[34:45.660 --> 34:47.160]  Fucking Nick turned into the Count.
[34:47.720 --> 34:49.500]  I did.
[34:50.740 --> 34:51.300]  One.
[34:51.720 --> 34:52.120]  One.
[34:52.200 --> 34:53.440]  Right, left, back.
[34:53.980 --> 34:54.280]  In.
[34:54.580 --> 34:55.520]  There we go.
[34:56.480 --> 34:57.220]  No, you lived!
[34:57.620 --> 34:57.960]  Damn!
[34:58.660 --> 34:59.460]  Oh, my God!
[34:59.780 --> 35:00.180]  The goo!
[35:00.400 --> 35:00.960]  Oh, it's on Geoff.
[35:02.500 --> 35:03.420]  Go, Nick, go!
[35:04.400 --> 35:04.880]  Oh!
[35:06.260 --> 35:06.740]  No!
[35:10.280 --> 35:11.580]  Fall off, bitch!
[35:13.820 --> 35:15.140]  Big, stupid tires.
[35:15.260 --> 35:15.740]  Fall off, bitch!
[35:15.760 --> 35:16.340]  Dodger, yes!
[35:17.020 --> 35:17.220]  Wow!
[35:17.680 --> 35:18.620]  There we go.
[35:19.260 --> 35:20.340]  My own fan.
[35:23.820 --> 35:24.840]  My own fan.
[35:28.020 --> 35:28.920]  I told you, man.
[35:28.920 --> 35:30.740]  Fans aren't all they're cracked up to be.
[35:31.160 --> 35:31.380]  Yep.
[35:33.020 --> 35:33.700]  Bye, guys.
[35:33.700 --> 35:34.620]  Oh, you...
[35:34.620 --> 35:35.260]  Wow.
[35:35.840 --> 35:36.460]  Oh, no!
[35:36.860 --> 35:37.240]  Wow.
[35:38.980 --> 35:39.360]  Bus!
[35:40.020 --> 35:40.820]  Oh, the bus!
[35:40.880 --> 35:41.360]  The bus!
[35:42.160 --> 35:42.440]  Ugh.
[35:43.320 --> 35:44.240]  Hope you learned something.
[35:44.520 --> 35:45.580]  Nope, I didn't learn shit.
[35:45.800 --> 35:47.140]  My dad can't teach me, neither can you.
[35:47.380 --> 35:47.560]  Oh!
[35:52.380 --> 35:53.440]  Oh, God, how is...
[35:53.440 --> 35:53.760]  Oh!
[35:53.760 --> 35:54.880]  How is Geoff still...
[35:54.880 --> 35:55.660]  Go, Geoff!
[35:55.740 --> 35:56.120]  Yes!
[35:56.120 --> 35:57.240]  Because I'm the best.
[35:57.320 --> 35:58.680]  That might have been...
[35:58.680 --> 36:00.180]  Geoffy, Geoff, Geoffy is best.
[36:00.300 --> 36:00.780]  I'm not going to win.
[36:00.940 --> 36:01.900]  I might have blown it.
[36:02.100 --> 36:03.440]  I don't think I'm going to have enough.
[36:04.060 --> 36:04.820]  Oh, you finished.
[36:04.980 --> 36:06.300]  Oh, you got it, you got it.
[36:06.300 --> 36:07.260]  I'd have to get to...
[36:07.260 --> 36:07.820]  There's no way.
[36:08.240 --> 36:09.040]  Come back?
[36:09.260 --> 36:10.020]  Damn it!
[36:10.300 --> 36:11.500]  Eric wins again, baby!
[36:12.060 --> 36:12.800]  Pay the man!
[36:13.820 --> 36:14.780]  Whoa, that's slow.
[36:15.780 --> 36:16.260]  Oh.
[36:16.700 --> 36:17.220]  My.
[36:17.760 --> 36:18.260]  God.
[36:18.600 --> 36:19.360]  My, uh...
[36:19.360 --> 36:21.540]  The rats have done it again!
[36:22.920 --> 36:23.440]  Boys?
[36:25.560 --> 36:27.340]  Get those rats in the chat.
[36:27.600 --> 36:28.340]  My goodness.
[36:28.960 --> 36:29.440]  Piss rats.
[36:30.200 --> 36:31.200]  My goodness.
[36:31.300 --> 36:32.340]  Let's get into chaos mode.
[36:32.420 --> 36:33.760]  Let's see what chaos mode is all about.
[36:33.780 --> 36:34.700]  All right, let's do it.
[36:34.700 --> 36:36.520]  Oh, Geoff, I think I...
[36:36.520 --> 36:38.680]  I think I unlocked a very cool looking car.
[36:38.880 --> 36:39.920]  I think I just got the mammoth.
[36:40.740 --> 36:41.320]  Oh, nice.
[36:41.400 --> 36:42.440]  You can use the mammoth.
[36:42.620 --> 36:43.420]  I'm mixing it up.
[36:43.460 --> 36:43.940]  I'm changing my car.
[36:43.940 --> 36:45.620]  No, I'm a fucking time machine guy, dude.
[36:45.900 --> 36:47.320]  Ooh, this one looks cool.
[36:48.420 --> 36:52.740]  I also unlocked a piece called the floor fan, which is a hazard.
[36:54.140 --> 36:56.740]  Mine, it just says waiting, but for some reason it won't...
[36:56.740 --> 36:57.100]  Oh, there we go.
[36:57.200 --> 36:57.420]  All right.
[36:57.560 --> 36:58.920]  It wouldn't let me...
[36:58.920 --> 37:01.200]  I'm going to quit and send another one because I have to...
[37:01.200 --> 37:02.000]  Oh, no, I can change it here.
[37:02.500 --> 37:02.840]  Yes!
[37:03.520 --> 37:05.180]  Thank God you didn't quit before you did that.
[37:05.520 --> 37:05.620]  Ooh!
[37:06.420 --> 37:07.220]  Weapons everywhere.
[37:07.380 --> 37:08.180]  Hazards everywhere.
[37:08.420 --> 37:09.380]  Walls turned off.
[37:09.400 --> 37:09.940]  Walls turned off.
[37:10.200 --> 37:11.320]  Well, see you boys in hell.
[37:11.440 --> 37:12.020]  Oh, no.
[37:12.320 --> 37:13.900]  All right, guys, let's get some bets going.
[37:15.360 --> 37:17.060]  This is where I thrive in chaos.
[37:17.360 --> 37:18.400]  All right, Geoff, check out my new car.
[37:20.120 --> 37:20.520]  Chaos.
[37:21.700 --> 37:22.520]  I got the...
[37:22.520 --> 37:23.260]  Oh, shit, dude.
[37:23.260 --> 37:24.460]  I got the falcon.
[37:24.860 --> 37:25.740]  The falcon.
[37:26.040 --> 37:26.260]  Yeah.
[37:26.340 --> 37:28.120]  Well, it's a fucking game over already.
[37:28.420 --> 37:28.640]  Yep.
[37:28.820 --> 37:29.880]  I got the falcon, boys.
[37:30.540 --> 37:30.980]  As expected.
[37:31.640 --> 37:32.640]  Oh, dude.
[37:33.100 --> 37:33.880]  This has...
[37:33.880 --> 37:34.380]  Look at this.
[37:34.860 --> 37:37.820]  It has boosts to start.
[37:37.860 --> 37:38.840]  Oh, shit.
[37:39.060 --> 37:41.140]  No walls, boosts to start.
[37:41.760 --> 37:43.420]  No, we'll die.
[37:43.980 --> 37:44.280]  Yeah.
[37:47.640 --> 37:48.660]  Oh, man.
[37:48.760 --> 37:50.540]  This ultimate chicken horse ass game.
[37:51.020 --> 37:52.140]  This is going to be rough.
[37:54.740 --> 37:55.360]  Oh, balls.
[37:55.680 --> 37:56.420]  Oh, boys.
[37:56.540 --> 37:57.180]  Oh, boys.
[37:57.680 --> 37:58.700]  All right.
[37:59.840 --> 38:00.660]  I thrive in chaos.
[38:04.600 --> 38:06.040]  Why am I sideways?
[38:06.460 --> 38:07.140]  Why am I sideways?
[38:07.520 --> 38:08.440]  This is a horse...
[38:08.440 --> 38:10.660]  This is a horse-like genre game.
[38:11.260 --> 38:13.140]  Oh, I fucking went too slow and died.
[38:14.260 --> 38:15.340]  Okay, here we go.
[38:15.940 --> 38:16.620]  Eric made it.
[38:17.000 --> 38:17.960]  I made it.
[38:19.060 --> 38:19.960]  Bye, get zapped.
[38:26.700 --> 38:28.680]  Geoff took us all off.
[38:30.000 --> 38:30.700]  It just...
[38:30.700 --> 38:31.260]  Oh, it's going...
[38:31.260 --> 38:32.080]  Geoff said that's enough.
[38:32.280 --> 38:32.300]  Oh, same.
[38:32.540 --> 38:35.460]  Oh, shit.
[38:35.460 --> 38:35.660]  Oh, shit.
[38:35.660 --> 38:36.800]  Oh, my God.
[38:37.280 --> 38:38.600]  No, I didn't get first.
[38:38.720 --> 38:39.540]  I got too scared.
[38:39.840 --> 38:40.780]  I got scared of Nick.
[38:40.860 --> 38:41.640]  He's just swinging.
[38:43.020 --> 38:43.460]  Wow.
[38:46.060 --> 38:48.460]  Guys, how are the bets looking?
[38:48.640 --> 38:49.340]  This is a good one.
[38:50.940 --> 38:53.960]  Dude, hazards already on the track is insane.
[38:56.860 --> 38:57.740]  Oh, God.
[38:58.020 --> 39:00.900]  That's the worst turn I've ever seen in my life.
[39:01.020 --> 39:02.240]  That's a shitty ending right there.
[39:02.680 --> 39:03.800]  Okay, here we go.
[39:03.900 --> 39:04.420]  Looking rough.
[39:04.420 --> 39:05.740]  All right, bad.
[39:07.620 --> 39:07.780]  Uh-oh.
[39:07.840 --> 39:08.920]  There goes Geoff.
[39:10.260 --> 39:11.060]  Oh, Eric.
[39:11.060 --> 39:11.800]  How did you make...
[39:14.420 --> 39:14.900]  What?
[39:15.100 --> 39:15.780]  Where am I?
[39:16.380 --> 39:17.000]  I'm dead already?
[39:18.500 --> 39:18.640]  Yep.
[39:19.580 --> 39:19.860]  How?
[39:20.120 --> 39:20.880]  I spawned dead?
[39:21.160 --> 39:21.340]  Yep.
[39:22.780 --> 39:23.700]  Get away from me.
[39:23.920 --> 39:25.380]  I just spawned again.
[39:26.700 --> 39:27.700]  You're doing it, Geoff.
[39:27.760 --> 39:28.420]  You're doing it.
[39:29.060 --> 39:31.120]  Doing it and doing it and doing it well.
[39:31.520 --> 39:32.000]  Easy.
[39:32.040 --> 39:34.280]  Doing it and doing it and doing it well.
[39:34.280 --> 39:34.740]  Easy.
[39:35.480 --> 39:35.920]  Easy.
[39:36.640 --> 39:37.220]  Doing it well.
[39:37.340 --> 39:38.560]  Oh, my God.
[39:38.680 --> 39:39.020]  That was you.
[39:39.440 --> 39:40.280]  Doing it well.
[39:40.320 --> 39:40.640]  No!
[39:41.060 --> 39:41.460]  Dude.
[39:42.020 --> 39:42.120]  No!
[39:42.520 --> 39:42.960]  Yes!
[39:44.220 --> 39:45.920]  You killed us, you bastard, man.
[39:46.240 --> 39:46.480]  Yeah.
[39:49.080 --> 39:50.420]  Finish and first place.
[39:50.460 --> 39:51.080]  He's up to 1,000?
[39:51.340 --> 39:51.560]  Yep.
[39:51.880 --> 39:52.340]  Damn it.
[39:54.160 --> 39:55.040]  Okay, what do we got?
[39:55.400 --> 39:56.080]  Oh, I don't want that.
[39:56.200 --> 39:56.840]  Oh, I don't want that.
[39:56.920 --> 39:57.380]  I'll take that.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.040]  Geoff, you're just like, yeah, all right.
[40:02.900 --> 40:03.780]  Somebody else put it.
[40:03.860 --> 40:04.280]  I don't want that.
[40:04.520 --> 40:05.160]  There we go.
[40:06.780 --> 40:08.400]  This is where I want mine to go.
[40:08.500 --> 40:09.120]  That's it.
[40:10.680 --> 40:11.560]  That's insane.
[40:11.940 --> 40:12.840]  Oh, shit.
[40:13.120 --> 40:14.320]  This sucks.
[40:15.200 --> 40:16.900]  We are so screwed.
[40:17.040 --> 40:17.980]  Oh, my God.
[40:19.240 --> 40:21.540]  I wish Forge and Halo worked like this.
[40:21.920 --> 40:22.140]  Yeah.
[40:22.600 --> 40:24.720]  It would have been so much more fun to make race maps.
[40:25.400 --> 40:26.540]  Oh, my God.
[40:28.700 --> 40:30.060]  Why do I have boost?
[40:30.200 --> 40:30.620]  No!
[40:30.740 --> 40:30.960]  Insane!
[40:30.960 --> 40:32.200]  That's the worst possible weapon.
[40:32.660 --> 40:32.680]  Oh, no.
[40:33.820 --> 40:35.200]  How did I fall off?
[40:38.880 --> 40:39.000]  Yes!
[40:39.600 --> 40:40.360]  You idiot!
[40:41.020 --> 40:41.560]  You fool!
[40:41.880 --> 40:42.640]  I couldn't see it.
[40:42.720 --> 40:43.480]  I was going too fast.
[40:43.640 --> 40:43.980]  Geoff, no!
[40:49.420 --> 40:51.220]  I thought I had time.
[40:51.260 --> 40:51.800]  Oh, God!
[40:54.360 --> 40:54.840]  Geoff!
[40:58.820 --> 40:59.420]  That's me.
[40:59.980 --> 41:00.660]  No, Geoff!
[41:00.760 --> 41:01.280]  Stop touching me!
[41:02.920 --> 41:04.480]  Not the first time he's heard that.
[41:05.480 --> 41:06.500]  We all died.
[41:06.640 --> 41:07.300]  Oh, my God.
[41:07.420 --> 41:08.140]  I thought it was you.
[41:15.320 --> 41:15.960]  Bye, guys.
[41:16.560 --> 41:16.980]  No!
[41:23.600 --> 41:24.640]  You're going to blow it.
[41:24.740 --> 41:25.680]  You're going to blow it.
[41:27.500 --> 41:29.460]  Nick has finished every round.
[41:30.240 --> 41:30.660]  Yes.
[41:31.700 --> 41:32.340]  Damn it.
[41:33.700 --> 41:37.120]  Imagine if you were able to play The Last of Us like this, Nick.
[41:39.180 --> 41:41.040]  I mean, this is that equivalent.
[41:41.320 --> 41:42.140]  I think, honestly.
[41:44.400 --> 41:46.820]  Speaking of which, I want to get back into that at some point.
[41:47.200 --> 41:47.680]  Good idea.
[41:48.640 --> 41:48.960]  I'm down.
[41:50.320 --> 41:51.360]  Oh, I have to go this way.
[41:51.460 --> 41:51.820]  There we go.
[41:52.960 --> 41:53.980]  Well, this looks awful.
[41:54.660 --> 41:55.880]  I just threw a couple of fans down.
[41:55.940 --> 41:56.360]  No big deal.
[41:57.160 --> 41:57.620]  You did?
[41:57.940 --> 41:58.240]  Yeah.
[41:58.260 --> 41:58.740]  Oh, you prick.
[41:59.860 --> 42:00.740]  Oh, no, idiot!
[42:01.460 --> 42:02.300]  Yeah, I got boost.
[42:02.300 --> 42:02.700]  Oh!
[42:04.660 --> 42:05.260]  Biggus.
[42:05.740 --> 42:06.340]  Dickus.
[42:06.900 --> 42:08.420]  Oh, jeez.
[42:09.820 --> 42:10.420]  No.
[42:10.640 --> 42:11.240]  No.
[42:11.500 --> 42:12.040]  Still in it.
[42:12.040 --> 42:12.640]  Still in it.
[42:13.600 --> 42:13.920]  Yes!
[42:13.920 --> 42:15.600]  You worthless turd!
[42:18.740 --> 42:19.760]  Oh, you both...
[42:20.160 --> 42:22.380]  Oh, we both bumped the thing.
[42:23.180 --> 42:23.740]  He's going to hit the wall.
[42:24.460 --> 42:25.680]  He got so scared.
[42:26.020 --> 42:26.800]  I sure did.
[42:27.120 --> 42:27.760]  Nick's got...
[42:27.760 --> 42:29.980]  He's fucking getting nerves of steel this time.
[42:30.620 --> 42:31.100]  Ugh.
[42:31.640 --> 42:32.560]  He's like a different man.
[42:34.020 --> 42:34.780]  Later, idiots!
[42:35.080 --> 42:36.200]  Geoff, you killed us both!
[42:36.880 --> 42:37.840]  It's like...
[42:37.840 --> 42:39.200]  Up until this moment, at least.
[42:41.460 --> 42:42.220]  Well, Geoff.
[42:42.780 --> 42:43.740]  Oh, my God!
[42:45.700 --> 42:47.320]  Geoff versus the fan.
[42:48.420 --> 42:53.760]  Oh, people in the chat say they want to see Last of Us again.
[42:54.160 --> 42:54.580]  Oh, good.
[42:56.400 --> 42:57.100]  That's awesome.
[42:57.160 --> 42:57.780]  I want to do it again.
[42:58.640 --> 42:58.880]  Oh!
[42:58.880 --> 42:59.520]  Hello.
[43:00.260 --> 43:00.900]  Don't shoot.
[43:01.100 --> 43:03.840]  I've been thinking about getting back into streaming and streaming a little bit of Call of Duty.
[43:04.060 --> 43:07.640]  I know I'm supposed to be doing all the PlayStation games or whatever, but I just kind of want to play Call of Duty.
[43:08.020 --> 43:08.380]  Do it!
[43:09.180 --> 43:09.720]  I think I will.
[43:10.500 --> 43:11.000]  Bye, Nick!
[43:11.940 --> 43:18.140]  I want to get that master prestige thing where you prestige ten times or whatever.
[43:18.680 --> 43:18.940]  Nope!
[43:20.340 --> 43:21.140]  Oh, my God!
[43:21.200 --> 43:22.420]  Geoff is going to take the lead!
[43:24.700 --> 43:25.720]  I blew it!
[43:25.800 --> 43:26.820]  I blew it!
[43:27.420 --> 43:28.400]  I had it!
[43:30.980 --> 43:31.800]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[43:31.800 --> 43:33.580]  That's going to be first place and it's going to be comeback.
[43:34.980 --> 43:35.300]  Fuck!
[43:36.300 --> 43:37.060]  God damn it!
[43:37.080 --> 43:37.900]  How did I get to third?
[43:38.120 --> 43:39.280]  I'm letting the rats down.
[43:40.420 --> 43:41.160]  What is that?
[43:41.280 --> 43:42.020]  No, that's a new one.
[43:42.140 --> 43:42.780]  So is this one.
[43:44.300 --> 43:44.620]  Geoff!
[43:45.580 --> 43:46.080]  You psycho.
[43:47.940 --> 43:48.820]  Where do we put it?
[43:48.860 --> 43:49.300]  Oh, there we go.
[43:50.120 --> 43:51.380]  This is going to be insane.
[43:52.140 --> 43:53.080]  Oh, that is...
[43:55.220 --> 43:55.860]  Oh, you...
[43:57.360 --> 43:57.680]  Geoff!
[43:57.680 --> 43:58.940]  I love it.
[43:59.080 --> 44:00.020]  Geoff, you're nuts.
[44:01.620 --> 44:02.660]  Well, you know.
[44:03.400 --> 44:04.360]  Got to live a little, boys.
[44:07.970 --> 44:08.870]  Off the edge!
[44:09.130 --> 44:10.130]  Come on, I jumped the track!
[44:10.270 --> 44:10.490]  Let me live!
[44:10.510 --> 44:11.410]  Oh, we both did!
[44:11.510 --> 44:12.210]  Come on!
[44:12.750 --> 44:14.830]  Well, you didn't cross that section though, so...
[44:14.830 --> 44:15.710]  Oh, we're sideways again.
[44:17.530 --> 44:18.270]  Don't touch the middle one!
[44:18.310 --> 44:18.770]  It's mine!
[44:19.090 --> 44:19.390]  No!
[44:21.170 --> 44:21.610]  No!
[44:22.230 --> 44:23.010]  Come on!
[44:23.430 --> 44:25.490]  He took a dive on purpose.
[44:25.610 --> 44:25.910]  Thank you.
[44:27.530 --> 44:29.590]  Well, he had to make sure that we got it done right.
[44:30.550 --> 44:31.950]  We're only ten minutes away.
[44:32.290 --> 44:32.990]  First checkpoint.
[44:33.570 --> 44:34.210]  You guys know that?
[44:34.710 --> 44:35.270]  From 5.01?
[44:35.790 --> 44:37.930]  We're only ten minutes away from 5.01, the best time.
[44:39.810 --> 44:41.430]  Wow, I can't believe I got through the goo.
[44:41.910 --> 44:42.130]  Ow!
[44:43.330 --> 44:44.230]  Oh, my God.
[44:44.430 --> 44:45.430]  Oh, my God!
[44:46.570 --> 44:47.510]  Oh, my God!
[44:48.030 --> 44:49.950]  Oh, I fucking can't believe it.
[44:50.310 --> 44:52.050]  Oh, I double can't believe it.
[44:52.550 --> 44:53.250]  Still in it!
[44:53.430 --> 44:54.050]  Still in it!
[44:54.070 --> 44:54.810]  No, no!
[44:54.810 --> 44:56.730]  Oh, my triple can't believe it.
[44:56.870 --> 44:57.970]  Oh, this one's for the rats!
[44:58.390 --> 44:59.690]  Oh, it's for the rats!
[45:00.290 --> 45:02.170]  Oh, it's for the rats!
[45:02.430 --> 45:03.710]  Here comes the poison cheese!
[45:03.850 --> 45:04.890]  No, it's for the rats!
[45:05.230 --> 45:05.650]  Oh, damn.
[45:07.970 --> 45:09.230]  Hey, hey, hey!
[45:09.470 --> 45:09.970]  Hey, prick!
[45:10.210 --> 45:10.650]  You're up!
[45:12.370 --> 45:13.710]  That one's for the cheese.
[45:21.550 --> 45:22.670]  Oh, my God.
[45:22.770 --> 45:23.570]  Oh, my God.
[45:23.750 --> 45:24.490]  Oh, Jesus.
[45:25.830 --> 45:27.090]  Don't worry, Nick's gonna blow it.
[45:28.050 --> 45:30.230]  Now, this is new Nerves of Steel, Nick.
[45:30.450 --> 45:31.630]  This is me, baby.
[45:33.710 --> 45:36.450]  I was shot. I didn't blow it.
[45:37.530 --> 45:38.090]  Just wanna be clear.
[45:38.290 --> 45:39.150]  I was shot.
[45:39.590 --> 45:40.310]  I was shot.
[45:42.230 --> 45:42.750]  Yes!
[45:49.150 --> 45:50.170]  That's my name!
[45:50.170 --> 45:50.490]  That's my name!
[45:55.090 --> 45:59.490]  Oh, that was brilliant, Geoff.
[46:00.670 --> 46:01.150]  Bye, guys.
[46:03.490 --> 46:04.450]  Floor fan!
[46:05.070 --> 46:05.690]  Floor fan!
[46:06.050 --> 46:06.070]  Oh, no!
[46:06.430 --> 46:07.690]  Yes, first place.
[46:08.410 --> 46:09.930]  This is some horse shit.
[46:10.210 --> 46:11.350]  Okay, okay.
[46:11.850 --> 46:13.010]  No, no more for Nick.
[46:13.030 --> 46:13.630]  I think that's it.
[46:13.650 --> 46:13.930]  Yes.
[46:14.230 --> 46:14.630]  Okay.
[46:14.850 --> 46:16.010]  More for Geoff, though.
[46:16.910 --> 46:17.470]  Finish.
[46:17.970 --> 46:19.050]  First place.
[46:19.190 --> 46:19.790]  Come on, come back.
[46:20.290 --> 46:20.590]  Yes!
[46:20.590 --> 46:20.810]  Oh!
[46:21.710 --> 46:22.650]  Oh, boy!
[46:22.750 --> 46:23.590]  We are...
[46:23.590 --> 46:24.330]  That's insane.
[46:24.450 --> 46:26.010]  We're within 50 points of each other.
[46:26.770 --> 46:27.370]  Floor fan.
[46:30.530 --> 46:31.010]  Yes!
[46:32.450 --> 46:33.830]  Oh, what a hell hole.
[46:35.450 --> 46:36.570]  What do you have?
[46:36.830 --> 46:37.550]  What is that hole?
[46:39.670 --> 46:40.930]  Right at the end.
[46:41.030 --> 46:42.290]  It's gonna make a difference who wins.
[46:42.590 --> 46:42.790]  Yep.
[46:43.950 --> 46:45.290]  It'll just fuck me.
[46:46.530 --> 46:47.350]  Oh, boys.
[46:47.910 --> 46:48.390]  Fuck.
[46:48.550 --> 46:49.230]  Oh, Geoff.
[46:49.910 --> 46:50.670]  Goo everywhere.
[46:50.670 --> 46:52.430]  Why do you get so gooey?
[46:53.230 --> 46:53.930]  You prick!
[46:55.130 --> 46:56.570]  You absolute prick!
[46:56.850 --> 46:57.290]  There we go.
[46:57.310 --> 46:57.650]  You!
[46:57.890 --> 46:58.510]  Yeah, that sucked.
[46:58.590 --> 46:59.410]  This one's for the rats.
[46:59.610 --> 47:00.610]  That sucked for both of us.
[47:05.080 --> 47:06.180]  Fuck me and the godads.
[47:06.200 --> 47:07.440]  For the rats!
[47:08.060 --> 47:09.620]  Oh, Geoff, you suck.
[47:11.160 --> 47:11.860]  This one?
[47:12.000 --> 47:13.440]  Oh, this one's for the rats.
[47:15.200 --> 47:16.700]  This is not going well.
[47:17.180 --> 47:20.660]  Well, I killed Geoff and myself.
[47:20.800 --> 47:21.080]  I'm good.
[47:21.080 --> 47:22.080]  Thank you.
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.340]  This is what Eric needed to make his little comeback for the rats.
[47:25.380 --> 47:26.580]  Don't know if anyone told you.
[47:26.860 --> 47:27.880]  This one's for the rats.
[47:27.960 --> 47:28.540]  Fuck off, Eric!
[47:28.900 --> 47:29.300]  Fuck!
[47:30.000 --> 47:30.940]  God damn it.
[47:31.140 --> 47:32.220]  Oh, you're so lucky!
[47:32.440 --> 47:33.440]  Oh, you're so lucky!
[47:33.880 --> 47:36.080]  Nick, are you blocking for Eric or something here?
[47:36.200 --> 47:36.880]  No, God no.
[47:36.920 --> 47:37.380]  Yeah, he is.
[47:39.060 --> 47:39.820]  I'm point shaving.
[47:39.920 --> 47:41.180]  He told me he wants me to win.
[47:41.660 --> 47:42.240]  I'm point shaving.
[47:42.300 --> 47:42.900]  You prick.
[47:43.140 --> 47:44.420]  You absolute prick.
[47:45.460 --> 47:46.680]  That's a pretty prick move.
[47:49.940 --> 47:50.940]  God, those rats.
[47:51.120 --> 47:52.180]  Son of a bitch.
[47:52.440 --> 47:52.680]  Die.
[47:52.680 --> 47:52.940]  No way.
[47:54.380 --> 47:54.840]  Yes.
[47:55.560 --> 47:55.880]  No.
[47:56.180 --> 47:56.400]  Well.
[47:56.720 --> 47:57.120]  Bye, Geoff.
[47:57.320 --> 47:57.600]  No!
[47:57.740 --> 47:58.060]  I lived!
[47:58.400 --> 47:58.760]  I lived!
[47:59.240 --> 48:00.140]  All right, Nick.
[48:00.600 --> 48:01.280]  All right, get big.
[48:02.300 --> 48:02.700]  Not yet.
[48:03.320 --> 48:03.560]  Now.
[48:04.780 --> 48:05.720]  Oh my God.
[48:07.140 --> 48:07.480]  Why?
[48:07.580 --> 48:07.860]  How?
[48:09.200 --> 48:10.000]  Kill him, Nick.
[48:10.580 --> 48:11.040]  Bully him.
[48:11.060 --> 48:11.700]  He did it!
[48:11.720 --> 48:12.380]  He killed me!
[48:14.060 --> 48:14.800]  Oh, goodbye!
[48:16.080 --> 48:16.520]  Oh!
[48:16.520 --> 48:17.640]  The fin!
[48:28.300 --> 48:29.100]  Oh, that's an explosive.
[48:29.380 --> 48:29.960]  Oh my God.
[48:30.220 --> 48:31.060]  What happened?
[48:31.600 --> 48:31.660]  Chaos mode.
[48:31.660 --> 48:32.440]  We lived, Geoff.
[48:32.560 --> 48:33.120]  We lived.
[48:33.400 --> 48:36.440]  Chaos mode is a whole other level, guys.
[48:38.360 --> 48:39.240]  Fucking idiot.
[48:39.280 --> 48:39.560]  Eric!
[48:41.140 --> 48:41.620]  No!
[48:42.520 --> 48:42.640]  What?
[48:46.120 --> 48:47.380]  You blew it.
[48:47.780 --> 48:48.860]  You fell forever, too.
[48:50.340 --> 48:51.440]  I'm so mad.
[48:54.790 --> 48:55.350]  Yes.
[48:55.630 --> 48:56.050]  Yes.
[48:56.250 --> 48:56.670]  No!
[48:56.950 --> 48:57.490]  No!
[48:58.550 --> 48:59.110]  No!
[48:59.230 --> 49:00.230]  You killed me!
[49:00.490 --> 49:01.110]  What happened?
[49:01.710 --> 49:02.490]  Did you make it?
[49:02.830 --> 49:03.290]  I did.
[49:04.890 --> 49:05.590]  It's fine.
[49:05.630 --> 49:06.330]  I'm way up there.
[49:08.630 --> 49:09.630]  Finish points.
[49:10.090 --> 49:10.610]  Oh, this is-
[49:10.610 --> 49:11.990]  First place bonus points.
[49:12.510 --> 49:12.870]  Oh!
[49:14.010 --> 49:15.650]  I died for first!
[49:18.950 --> 49:19.910]  Oh, dear.
[49:20.470 --> 49:21.690]  Oh, dear.
[49:22.810 --> 49:23.750]  There we go.
[49:24.870 --> 49:25.730]  A little ziggy zaggy.
[49:25.990 --> 49:29.790]  Oh, insane way to go.
[49:31.330 --> 49:33.470]  This is gonna be a long track.
[49:33.830 --> 49:35.350]  Yeah, that's why it's for the rats.
[49:40.100 --> 49:41.240]  Okay, I'm alive.
[49:41.480 --> 49:42.220]  I am alive.
[49:42.580 --> 49:43.360]  I'm alive.
[49:44.280 --> 49:44.660]  Go!
[49:44.660 --> 49:46.620]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[49:48.740 --> 49:49.360]  Ow!
[49:50.640 --> 49:51.260]  Motherfuck!
[49:52.120 --> 49:52.500]  Bye, Nick.
[49:54.020 --> 49:55.800]  You just whacked me one time.
[49:57.120 --> 49:57.740]  Ah!
[49:59.300 --> 49:59.820]  Yes!
[50:00.080 --> 50:01.060]  Oh, my God!
[50:01.320 --> 50:02.840]  Oh, my God!
[50:03.060 --> 50:04.760]  You fucking asshole!
[50:05.300 --> 50:05.780]  Dude, he's-
[50:05.780 --> 50:07.180]  Dude, he's throwing for me.
[50:07.480 --> 50:10.700]  Fucking swept me off the map.
[50:11.740 --> 50:13.600]  That was so bull.
[50:13.600 --> 50:13.920]  No!
[50:14.660 --> 50:16.920]  A fucking idiot.
[50:17.220 --> 50:18.220]  Yes, yes.
[50:18.520 --> 50:19.420]  This one-
[50:19.420 --> 50:21.600]  This one is for everyone in the chat.
[50:21.720 --> 50:23.240]  This one's for the rats, baby.
[50:24.780 --> 50:27.040]  No, I'm getting swatted rat style!
[50:28.240 --> 50:29.140]  I'm alive!
[50:29.320 --> 50:30.000]  Oh, my God.
[50:30.140 --> 50:30.680]  No way.
[50:31.920 --> 50:32.440]  No!
[50:33.020 --> 50:33.960]  We have to work together, Geoff.
[50:36.340 --> 50:37.380]  All right, that's done.
[50:39.200 --> 50:40.580]  Oh, my God!
[50:41.340 --> 50:42.940]  No, no!
[50:43.140 --> 50:43.460]  Please!
[50:43.460 --> 50:44.340]  Please, sir!
[50:45.000 --> 50:45.660]  I'm alive!
[50:45.920 --> 50:46.560]  I'm still alive!
[50:49.120 --> 50:49.540]  No!
[50:51.680 --> 50:52.220]  How?
[50:52.560 --> 50:53.000]  How?
[50:53.560 --> 50:53.840]  Shut up.
[50:53.960 --> 50:54.460]  How?
[50:55.080 --> 50:55.620]  How?
[50:56.300 --> 50:57.240]  It's okay. It's all right.
[50:57.320 --> 50:57.580]  It's okay.
[50:58.880 --> 50:59.320]  Nope.
[51:00.280 --> 51:00.820]  No!
[51:01.800 --> 51:03.020]  No, the fans!
[51:03.180 --> 51:03.840]  No, the fans!
[51:07.580 --> 51:09.060]  All right, here we go.
[51:09.160 --> 51:09.680]  This is it.
[51:11.320 --> 51:12.060]  Win, Geoff.
[51:12.440 --> 51:13.100]  Win now.
[51:13.100 --> 51:14.080]  Win here.
[51:14.640 --> 51:15.460]  Win game.
[51:16.820 --> 51:17.260]  No.
[51:17.920 --> 51:18.760]  Oh, Eric.
[51:19.000 --> 51:19.560]  Fuck me.
[51:19.800 --> 51:20.240]  Eric.
[51:21.680 --> 51:22.860]  Okay, there we go.
[51:23.200 --> 51:23.380]  Yes.
[51:26.160 --> 51:26.600]  Game.
[51:28.080 --> 51:28.480]  No.
[51:29.960 --> 51:30.400]  Nick.
[51:31.340 --> 51:31.980]  Oh, Eric.
[51:32.660 --> 51:33.000]  No touching.
[51:33.060 --> 51:34.100]  No touching, no touching, no touching!
[51:34.280 --> 51:35.200]  Oh, I didn't do that!
[51:35.860 --> 51:36.300]  No!
[51:38.260 --> 51:39.060]  Come on, Geoff.
[51:39.100 --> 51:39.700]  You got this.
[51:39.740 --> 51:40.340]  There you go.
[51:41.860 --> 51:42.860]  You killed me!
[51:43.520 --> 51:47.400]  You killed me, you son of a bitch!
[51:47.900 --> 51:48.200]  No!
[51:48.720 --> 51:49.480]  Geoff might win.
[51:49.940 --> 51:50.480]  He might.
[51:50.660 --> 51:51.740]  Well, let's see how many times he...
[51:51.740 --> 51:53.220]  Oh, he didn't complete enough, I don't think.
[51:53.540 --> 51:53.840]  Maybe.
[51:53.980 --> 51:54.460]  I don't know.
[51:54.580 --> 51:55.500]  I think he did.
[51:55.540 --> 51:56.040]  I think he did.
[51:56.120 --> 51:57.140]  I think it's gonna be close.
[51:57.220 --> 51:57.800]  It's gonna be tight.
[52:00.540 --> 52:00.760]  Yes!
[52:00.760 --> 52:01.180]  He got it.
[52:01.240 --> 52:01.480]  Yes!
[52:01.900 --> 52:02.860]  He got it.
[52:03.300 --> 52:03.740]  Yes!
[52:03.760 --> 52:05.180]  Yes, yes, yes, yes!
[52:05.840 --> 52:08.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've done it.
[52:09.620 --> 52:10.320]  This was crazy.
[52:10.320 --> 52:14.220]  We are minutes away from 5-0-1.
[52:14.580 --> 52:15.920]  This has been so good.
[52:16.220 --> 52:18.760]  I just unlocked a part called Ring of Fire Jump.
[52:19.340 --> 52:19.900]  Incredible.
[52:20.160 --> 52:20.900]  Yeah, I know.
[52:21.060 --> 52:22.480]  Incredible win from Geoff.
[52:22.800 --> 52:23.880]  What a way to cap it off.
[52:24.300 --> 52:25.440]  That was crazy.
[52:26.860 --> 52:29.280]  Crazy week of content, boys.
[52:29.720 --> 52:30.280]  Congratulations.
[52:32.380 --> 52:36.740]  Sad that Andrew and Gavin had to get to their...
[52:37.360 --> 52:40.660]  They were both doing the penis restructuring or whatever.
[52:40.940 --> 52:42.860]  Well, yeah, but it's the only way they could...
[52:42.860 --> 52:43.700]  Thank you, Khan2158.
[52:43.700 --> 52:44.940]  Live a normal life, right?
[52:45.020 --> 52:45.680]  Khan knows.
[52:45.720 --> 52:47.040]  That's what the subs are for.
[52:47.160 --> 52:48.760]  Khan knows that they both have weird dick.
[52:48.880 --> 52:50.800]  It's a medical term called weird dick.
[52:51.060 --> 52:51.960]  That's what we want.
[52:52.040 --> 52:57.020]  We want Gavin and Andrew to be able to live some sort of facsimile of a real life.
[52:57.280 --> 52:58.040]  Just a normal life.
[52:58.480 --> 52:59.540]  Like most of us.
[52:59.540 --> 53:02.640]  We just walk down the street with the confidence of a normal human penis.
[53:02.800 --> 53:03.680]  It's not weird.
[53:03.820 --> 53:05.000]  It's not all mashed about.
[53:05.040 --> 53:05.280]  Right.
[53:05.540 --> 53:07.760]  It's not, you know, bulbous and gross.
[53:07.940 --> 53:09.380]  It's not...
[53:09.380 --> 53:14.800]  It's not a pain that we understand, but we support our friends in this journey.
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.260]  We support our weird dick friends.
[53:16.600 --> 53:17.760]  You know, it is what it is.
[53:18.260 --> 53:23.360]  So while they're getting their penises fixed in Turkey, we'll be holding down the fort.
[53:26.300 --> 53:29.820]  They're getting hair transplants, but not on the top of their head.
[53:29.980 --> 53:30.700]  It's all pubes.
[53:31.240 --> 53:31.900]  Oh, interesting.
[53:32.680 --> 53:32.780]  Yeah.
[53:33.760 --> 53:34.480]  It's just...
[53:34.480 --> 53:36.180]  You gotta get those big pubes.
[53:36.200 --> 53:39.540]  They take them off the back of your head and they stick it in just right above your dick
[53:39.540 --> 53:42.600]  so you have long, regular, non-curly hair.
[53:42.700 --> 53:44.120]  Just your regular...
[53:44.120 --> 53:46.220]  Now, is it true they take it off the top of the back of your head?
[53:46.220 --> 53:46.580]  Yeah.
[53:47.120 --> 53:49.780]  And you can style it however you want because it's real hair.
[53:50.080 --> 53:51.720]  So it responds to all the same products.
[53:51.720 --> 53:52.980]  Might be softer, honestly.
[53:53.120 --> 53:53.240]  Yeah.
[53:53.240 --> 53:56.420]  I do like a low taper fade around the whole thing.
[53:56.540 --> 53:57.060]  You know what I mean?
[53:57.080 --> 53:57.240]  Oh, that's good.
[53:57.340 --> 53:58.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:58.940 --> 53:59.760]  Clean up the edges.
[53:59.760 --> 54:01.180]  Get the landing strippy. Always wanted.
[54:01.380 --> 54:01.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[54:02.200 --> 54:03.900]  I mean, it is what it is.
[54:04.440 --> 54:05.380]  It is what it is.
[54:05.440 --> 54:08.500]  But guys, it is... we're 10 seconds away.
[54:08.860 --> 54:12.300]  Are you ready for the best time of the week?
[54:12.380 --> 54:14.100]  We've been waiting all week for it.
[54:14.480 --> 54:15.860]  It's quitting time.
[54:16.240 --> 54:17.860]  And right now...
