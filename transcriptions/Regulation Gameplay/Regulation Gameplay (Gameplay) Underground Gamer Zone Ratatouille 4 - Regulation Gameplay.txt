[00:00.000 --> 00:04.900]  We are in the zone, Eric, for more Ratatouille, more Rat action.
[00:05.080 --> 00:09.540]  Let me see if I can adjust my profile quickly to reflect.
[00:09.640 --> 00:14.600]  Because Discord apparently just added the ability to set statuses.
[00:14.860 --> 00:18.140]  Yeah, it's like watching stuff, wandering IRL.
[00:18.500 --> 00:20.460]  But we both picked in the zone.
[00:21.440 --> 00:24.460]  But Andrew was like, oh, check this out, you can set your mood.
[00:24.500 --> 00:25.480]  Gamer zone!
[00:25.820 --> 00:28.140]  Oh, dude, we're in the fucking gamer zone.
[00:28.140 --> 00:31.500]  Nah, we're not. Recreation.
[00:31.720 --> 00:34.600]  Hey, honestly, just looking at it, you're in the underground.
[00:35.300 --> 00:36.260]  Oh, yeah, obviously.
[00:36.580 --> 00:37.860]  Like, no fucking doubt.
[00:38.480 --> 00:40.300]  We aren't easily intimidated.
[00:40.500 --> 00:42.880]  The underground is for you, not for the faint of heart.
[00:43.000 --> 00:44.980]  Your battle cry, take no prisoners.
[00:45.540 --> 00:46.800]  Classic you.
[00:48.460 --> 00:51.560]  But hey, I like to play clean, play hard, and play the part.
[00:51.760 --> 00:53.440]  We're gonna go underground.
[00:54.020 --> 00:54.860]  We're locked in.
[00:55.200 --> 00:56.140]  This is good.
[00:57.560 --> 01:00.940]  Okay, let's load into some Ratatouille.
[01:01.140 --> 01:02.100]  I'm locked in.
[01:02.840 --> 01:04.980]  I was a little out of it last time we did this.
[01:05.080 --> 01:06.780]  I was showing all the bonus content.
[01:07.220 --> 01:08.190]  I just, I don't know where my...
[01:08.680 --> 01:11.280]  I think we took too long of a gap between recordings.
[01:11.340 --> 01:12.240]  It's not everything.
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.140]  Yeah, that must have been the problem.
[01:14.740 --> 01:15.340]  But now...
[01:15.340 --> 01:16.100]  We're dialed in.
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.800]  So here's what I'll ask, because last time this was the burning question that we had.
[01:20.800 --> 01:21.800]  This is Ratatouille.
[01:21.960 --> 01:26.780]  This is the fourth iteration of Ratatouille in our video series,
[01:26.940 --> 01:32.880]  which is an Achievement Hunter guide to getting 100% in Ratatouille 2007 on the Xbox 360.
[01:34.820 --> 01:37.920]  Did we determine, do you think...
[01:37.920 --> 01:43.260]  Giving yourself some space from where we were in the game as an active gamer.
[01:43.880 --> 01:45.420]  As an active gamer.
[01:45.460 --> 01:48.480]  Do you think we cleared that level out 100%?
[01:48.700 --> 01:49.920]  Absolutely not.
[01:49.920 --> 01:51.840]  Okay, so I'll ask you right now.
[01:52.160 --> 01:54.180]  Should we go and try and figure out what it is?
[01:55.260 --> 01:56.340]  We gotta go back here.
[01:56.660 --> 01:57.020]  Okay, alright.
[01:57.040 --> 01:57.520]  I'm sorry.
[01:57.700 --> 01:58.740]  We gotta go back.
[01:58.740 --> 01:59.080]  No, don't be sorry.
[01:59.240 --> 02:02.360]  I feel like at the time I was ready for something else.
[02:03.120 --> 02:03.560]  Now...
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.100]  Oh, totally.
[02:04.280 --> 02:09.000]  With time on our side and some space to kind of figure it out,
[02:09.340 --> 02:13.180]  I think we have to figure out what's here.
[02:13.400 --> 02:14.500]  We gotta do this stuff.
[02:14.660 --> 02:16.760]  We gotta find 11.
[02:17.020 --> 02:17.600]  Because you're right.
[02:17.740 --> 02:18.780]  I thought about it later.
[02:19.860 --> 02:20.660]  Missing 11?
[02:21.120 --> 02:21.460]  Insane.
[02:21.580 --> 02:23.000]  It's such a weird number.
[02:23.440 --> 02:24.820]  It's just such a weird number.
[02:25.000 --> 02:25.780]  It's not right.
[02:26.620 --> 02:27.180]  Look at that.
[02:27.760 --> 02:29.480]  So I did a little bit of running yesterday.
[02:29.660 --> 02:30.460]  I found that.
[02:30.580 --> 02:32.360]  I think that might be a thing we need.
[02:32.460 --> 02:33.560]  Wasn't that just a health coin?
[02:34.940 --> 02:35.780]  No, it's not.
[02:36.260 --> 02:37.660]  Because I had that thought too.
[02:37.840 --> 02:39.300]  But it doesn't look like the health.
[02:39.400 --> 02:39.980]  Oh, interesting.
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.200]  It's a different coin.
[02:41.460 --> 02:41.700]  Okay.
[02:41.820 --> 02:43.000]  So let's go over and do that.
[02:43.180 --> 02:48.220]  So after we recorded last time, I ran through and I think I found the stuff that we were missing.
[02:48.220 --> 02:48.780]  No!
[02:49.380 --> 02:49.720]  Really?
[02:50.780 --> 02:51.180]  Yeah.
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.580]  I think we're missing three minigames and I think I have them all so we can move on.
[02:55.720 --> 02:57.160]  Because we need to get more bonus content.
[02:57.300 --> 02:59.460]  Yeah, because you showed all of our bonus content.
[02:59.460 --> 02:59.660]  I forgot.
[02:59.940 --> 03:01.140]  Yeah, I forgot what we were doing.
[03:01.300 --> 03:01.740]  I was out of it.
[03:01.980 --> 03:02.940]  Oh, shit!
[03:03.180 --> 03:04.680]  We didn't even get this last time.
[03:05.660 --> 03:06.060]  No.
[03:06.520 --> 03:06.920]  Damn.
[03:07.120 --> 03:07.580]  Let's see what happens.
[03:08.080 --> 03:08.700]  What does this do?
[03:09.980 --> 03:10.300]  One.
[03:10.420 --> 03:10.860]  That's 90.
[03:11.020 --> 03:11.220]  Yep.
[03:11.780 --> 03:16.860]  I have a feeling, though, my hope is some of the minigames we have to do might give us the rest of what we need.
[03:16.860 --> 03:18.720]  Boy, I also hope so.
[03:19.480 --> 03:20.740]  He walks so weird.
[03:21.120 --> 03:21.320]  I believe...
[03:21.320 --> 03:23.020]  He walks so fucking weird in the mud.
[03:23.020 --> 03:23.140]  In the mud.
[03:23.600 --> 03:23.780]  Yeah.
[03:24.180 --> 03:25.240]  It's so... it's terrible.
[03:26.820 --> 03:28.120]  Don't... don't get attacked by those.
[03:28.120 --> 03:28.480]  I think it's through here.
[03:28.480 --> 03:28.940]  You can't jump on top.
[03:29.100 --> 03:29.440]  There you go.
[03:29.560 --> 03:29.840]  Yeah.
[03:30.820 --> 03:31.700]  Can I get on this?
[03:31.780 --> 03:32.300]  Yeah, I can.
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.680]  I think we need to do this one.
[03:33.760 --> 03:34.040]  Really?
[03:34.680 --> 03:36.700]  We haven't done Cutting Board Calamity 1?
[03:36.940 --> 03:38.860]  Okay, do you remember what you have to do in this one?
[03:39.820 --> 03:41.720]  I think this... I don't know.
[03:42.020 --> 03:42.420]  What do you mean?
[03:42.420 --> 03:43.500]  I'm not sure which one this is.
[03:43.900 --> 03:46.340]  If this is the one where you hit the vegetables.
[03:46.580 --> 03:47.140]  Uh-huh.
[03:47.400 --> 03:48.040]  On the cutting board?
[03:48.200 --> 03:49.240]  I believe it is.
[03:49.940 --> 03:52.380]  Because last time you said you remembered and then...
[03:52.380 --> 03:53.480]  No, this is...
[03:53.480 --> 03:53.540]  What the fuck?
[03:53.540 --> 03:54.040]  Look at this.
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.060]  What is this?
[03:55.080 --> 03:57.360]  Smash 30 veggies before time runs out.
[03:57.460 --> 03:57.700]  Okay.
[03:58.160 --> 03:58.800]  Let's do it.
[04:00.140 --> 04:00.520]  I don't...
[04:00.520 --> 04:01.400]  Oh, and then they drop?
[04:02.460 --> 04:02.880]  Is dropping...
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.200]  I don't see where the challenge is.
[04:04.280 --> 04:05.520]  Is them dropping bad or good?
[04:06.460 --> 04:07.400]  I don't know.
[04:07.680 --> 04:08.380]  Hit the peppers.
[04:08.560 --> 04:10.940]  I mean, there's a knife, but it's not doing anything.
[04:11.240 --> 04:11.640]  There you go.
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.580]  We're peppered up.
[04:12.580 --> 04:15.640]  I think we were doing the advanced version of this with movement.
[04:15.940 --> 04:16.960]  I think you might be right.
[04:17.100 --> 04:18.720]  And this is like baby version of cutting board.
[04:18.720 --> 04:22.040]  Yeah, this might be version one baby mode action.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.060]  And you did it.
[04:23.160 --> 04:23.500]  There we go.
[04:23.540 --> 04:23.680]  Great.
[04:23.800 --> 04:23.960]  Easy.
[04:23.960 --> 04:25.220]  And you got flour?
[04:26.560 --> 04:26.880]  Flour?
[04:27.440 --> 04:27.620]  Nice.
[04:27.620 --> 04:28.160]  Yeah, nice.
[04:28.220 --> 04:28.480]  Good call.
[04:28.800 --> 04:30.040]  A little flirtily on it.
[04:30.040 --> 04:30.220]  Mm-hmm.
[04:30.220 --> 04:30.840]  Sniffing it out.
[04:31.000 --> 04:31.380]  Mm-hmm.
[04:32.180 --> 04:33.860]  If there's anything Remy likes, it's that white powder.
[04:34.060 --> 04:34.440]  He's all about that white powder.
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.340]  That's what I'm talking about.
[04:35.420 --> 04:37.220]  Yeah, that's why me and Remy get along.
[04:37.260 --> 04:37.760]  You know what I'm saying?
[04:38.780 --> 04:39.880]  I'm in that rat mode.
[04:39.920 --> 04:40.860]  I'm in the rat zone.
[04:42.160 --> 04:43.020]  That's what I say.
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.100]  Somebody's just snorting a massive line and then going, I'm in the rat zone.
[04:48.400 --> 04:50.980]  I'm cutting it up with a chef's knife, putting in lines.
[04:51.780 --> 04:53.020]  I'm in the rat zone.
[04:55.900 --> 04:56.260]  Okay.
[04:56.540 --> 04:58.140]  Okay, so that didn't give us anything.
[04:58.400 --> 04:59.280]  But at least we did it.
[04:59.400 --> 04:59.700]  No.
[05:00.240 --> 05:02.720]  Yeah, so let's try the next one I think is over here.
[05:02.860 --> 05:04.260]  I don't remember how to...
[05:04.260 --> 05:05.860]  You have to go...
[05:06.460 --> 05:07.040]  Is it this?
[05:07.260 --> 05:09.060]  If it's not this, it's on the other side of this.
[05:09.060 --> 05:11.020]  It's to the right.
[05:11.840 --> 05:12.960]  Let's go around.
[05:13.960 --> 05:15.060]  I can't go that way.
[05:15.580 --> 05:16.380]  There you go.
[05:16.520 --> 05:19.640]  Yeah, go back this way and there's a spring to get up there.
[05:19.660 --> 05:19.940]  Okay.
[05:20.260 --> 05:21.860]  If it's not over here, it's back behind you.
[05:22.840 --> 05:24.220]  Yeah, I'm trying to get up here.
[05:24.340 --> 05:25.380]  Oh, yeah, yeah, keep...
[05:25.380 --> 05:26.440]  Yeah, go...
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.220]  Go...
[05:27.220 --> 05:27.520]  Which way?
[05:27.940 --> 05:30.840]  Go around to your left and then over to the right.
[05:31.260 --> 05:33.160]  Because I think that's where...
[05:33.160 --> 05:34.060]  Oh, yeah, nice.
[05:34.060 --> 05:34.600]  Good call.
[05:35.380 --> 05:38.720]  Yeah, unfortunately I've memorized a bunch of this level.
[05:42.820 --> 05:43.460]  That sucks.
[05:43.540 --> 05:43.980]  Oh, no!
[05:44.280 --> 05:44.940]  Oh, come on!
[05:46.040 --> 05:46.680]  Oh, fuck.
[05:46.840 --> 05:46.980]  Okay.
[05:47.060 --> 05:48.120]  At least there's health up there.
[05:48.280 --> 05:48.500]  You're fine.
[05:48.860 --> 05:52.000]  Yeah, you know, I was distracted because I was like, I should probably get that.
[05:52.060 --> 05:52.820]  Yeah, no, you got it.
[05:52.820 --> 05:53.660]  Probably grab this health.
[05:53.680 --> 05:54.540]  No, you're a full health rat.
[05:54.540 --> 05:55.460]  Remember, you have to hit the button.
[05:55.540 --> 05:55.800]  There you go.
[05:55.820 --> 05:56.700]  You have to hit the button to land.
[05:57.420 --> 05:57.700]  Okay.
[05:58.400 --> 05:59.840]  Is this another minigame we haven't done yet?
[06:00.600 --> 06:02.140]  Yep, this is number two.
[06:02.640 --> 06:04.060]  Another cutting board calamity.
[06:07.220 --> 06:10.160]  The other one we're missing, that I at least I hope is the one we're missing.
[06:10.160 --> 06:12.540]  The other one we're missing is really out of the way, so.
[06:13.580 --> 06:14.020]  Interesting.
[06:14.180 --> 06:21.320]  Maybe we'll get ten coins for finishing all three at this stage, because I assume we had done the third before and now this is the first.
[06:21.480 --> 06:21.720]  Right.
[06:25.740 --> 06:26.180]  Wow.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.020]  I was going to mock.
[06:27.420 --> 06:29.920]  I was going to mock, like, come on!
[06:30.660 --> 06:32.140]  There's some drift to this.
[06:32.680 --> 06:32.940]  Okay.
[06:33.560 --> 06:34.200]  Lock it in.
[06:34.580 --> 06:35.000]  Lock, no.
[06:35.880 --> 06:37.320]  I'm not, that's not on purpose.
[06:38.200 --> 06:38.440]  No!
[06:38.920 --> 06:39.660]  What is happening?
[06:39.660 --> 06:40.520]  Come on!
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.360]  No, there's, see, there's totally sliding.
[06:45.360 --> 06:49.060]  This is, this is way harder than it looks.
[06:49.560 --> 06:50.880]  I swear, I promise.
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.200]  This is ridiculous.
[06:53.320 --> 06:54.740]  This is the toughest one.
[06:54.960 --> 06:55.040]  Okay.
[06:55.380 --> 06:56.020]  Nope.
[06:58.440 --> 06:59.720]  Him screaming.
[07:00.300 --> 07:00.920]  Hit it!
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.380]  I'm trying!
[07:03.720 --> 07:04.640]  Hit the peppers!
[07:05.520 --> 07:07.880]  I'm doing the best I can.
[07:07.940 --> 07:08.860]  No, it's not.
[07:08.860 --> 07:10.300]  The peppers aren't near anything.
[07:10.440 --> 07:13.160]  I believe, I believe that you can do much better than this.
[07:13.360 --> 07:15.100]  Oh, come on, come on, come on.
[07:15.120 --> 07:15.400]  No!
[07:15.880 --> 07:17.940]  Oh my god, come on!
[07:18.360 --> 07:19.400]  Come on, come on, come on.
[07:20.640 --> 07:21.120]  No!
[07:21.760 --> 07:22.620]  Come on!
[07:22.940 --> 07:24.020]  Okay, we're going to have to do it again.
[07:24.260 --> 07:25.400]  No, that's, listen.
[07:26.080 --> 07:28.620]  Why would I drift in this level?
[07:28.960 --> 07:30.560]  Why would I slide everywhere?
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.240]  There's no reason for it.
[07:32.260 --> 07:34.760]  There's no visual indicator that that's a thing.
[07:35.220 --> 07:38.020]  Also, is that just food floating to the left?
[07:38.020 --> 07:38.680]  What is that?
[07:39.000 --> 07:39.860]  Can I get that?
[07:39.980 --> 07:41.020]  Maybe it's heaven.
[07:42.540 --> 07:43.680]  Oh, this is hell.
[07:44.260 --> 07:45.380]  Absolutely not heaven.
[07:45.880 --> 07:48.100]  Pat and Oswalt just going, oh!
[07:49.260 --> 07:51.340]  This is going to be one of those moments where people go,
[07:51.440 --> 07:55.140]  what's some of your favorite quotes from the video game they've played
[07:55.140 --> 07:57.080]  since they started doing regulation gameplays?
[07:57.100 --> 07:57.780]  And it's going to be that.
[07:59.600 --> 08:00.040]  Okay.
[08:02.340 --> 08:03.460]  See, now I've got to figure out.
[08:03.540 --> 08:04.060]  I just want to...
[08:05.040 --> 08:06.220]  29 to 30, we've got time.
[08:06.300 --> 08:07.020]  I just want to make a...
[08:07.020 --> 08:08.520]  Can they do a pat and death loop?
[08:12.160 --> 08:13.260]  Oh, my God.
[08:14.300 --> 08:15.220]  Oh, thank God.
[08:15.380 --> 08:16.880]  Okay, we got that sweet milk.
[08:19.420 --> 08:19.800]  Nice.
[08:20.320 --> 08:22.020]  Get some of that milk going.
[08:22.900 --> 08:24.940]  I wonder how close we are to finishing any of these dishes.
[08:25.260 --> 08:25.780]  Oh, my God.
[08:29.240 --> 08:30.740]  I'm going to make a declaration right now.
[08:30.900 --> 08:32.440]  We're going to go do this third minigame.
[08:32.660 --> 08:35.140]  If that doesn't, if we don't have 10 coins by then,
[08:35.180 --> 08:36.020]  we're going to a new zone.
[08:36.080 --> 08:36.800]  Okay, okay.
[08:36.960 --> 08:37.820]  I appreciate that.
[08:37.820 --> 08:38.820]  We can come back later.
[08:39.140 --> 08:39.500]  Yeah.
[08:39.580 --> 08:40.380]  We'll figure out the coins.
[08:40.520 --> 08:41.100]  I respect that.
[08:41.240 --> 08:41.960]  At least...
[08:41.960 --> 08:44.600]  Hey, at least we got the one so we know it's not a weird number.
[08:45.000 --> 08:45.580]  Excellent work.
[08:45.660 --> 08:46.740]  You have made a souffle.
[08:47.940 --> 08:48.840]  Did we make it?
[08:49.980 --> 08:50.740]  Oh, hell yeah.
[08:52.940 --> 08:53.820]  I don't know.
[08:54.240 --> 08:54.980]  What does that mean?
[08:54.980 --> 08:55.500]  Okay, now what?
[08:56.320 --> 08:57.420]  What do we do?
[08:57.840 --> 09:00.060]  I think that means we beat all the minigames here, doesn't it?
[09:01.220 --> 09:02.780]  I think we got one more.
[09:02.980 --> 09:03.340]  How?
[09:03.480 --> 09:04.680]  But it's all the ingredients.
[09:04.880 --> 09:05.680]  No, but...
[09:05.680 --> 09:06.940]  No, I see what you mean, but look.
[09:06.940 --> 09:08.220]  We got this, we got that.
[09:08.220 --> 09:08.600]  Oh, we do.
[09:08.740 --> 09:08.820]  You're right, you're right.
[09:08.820 --> 09:11.300]  There's no rhyme or reason to any of this.
[09:12.260 --> 09:13.640]  Hey, I don't blame you, though.
[09:13.700 --> 09:16.760]  That's logical, but think like, hey, one recipe per level.
[09:16.800 --> 09:17.100]  Yes.
[09:17.180 --> 09:19.180]  It'd be a way to track what minigames you did.
[09:19.560 --> 09:20.220]  Yes, exactly.
[09:20.620 --> 09:25.960]  It feels incredibly reasonable to make that assumption, but no.
[09:27.140 --> 09:28.880]  That is not how any of this works.
[09:28.980 --> 09:29.780]  This game is so dumb.
[09:30.240 --> 09:30.840]  This is so dumb.
[09:30.840 --> 09:31.540]  It's really dumb.
[09:31.580 --> 09:34.140]  I will say, there's a lot to this game, though.
[09:34.140 --> 09:39.900]  If you bought this when you were a kid, and you were really into it, dude, this would've been so much bang for your buck.
[09:40.820 --> 09:45.300]  See, this is why I bounced off it when we looked at the achievements, and I had two in 2007.
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.180]  This is more Ratatouille than I wanted.
[09:48.300 --> 09:50.000]  I just wanted easy gamer score.
[09:50.080 --> 09:53.180]  And I will say, it's more than even the movie.
[09:53.480 --> 09:53.620]  Fuck.
[09:53.680 --> 09:54.900]  So, there you go.
[09:55.400 --> 09:55.760]  Oh, yeah.
[09:57.020 --> 10:00.500]  We're coming up, by the end of this, we'll be four hours into Ratatouille.
[10:00.960 --> 10:01.640]  I don't even think they've...
[10:01.640 --> 10:02.500]  We've doubled the length.
[10:02.500 --> 10:05.740]  Have they made a Ratatouille, like a sequel?
[10:06.580 --> 10:06.620]  Oh.
[10:07.200 --> 10:08.520]  Like, that would be the name, right?
[10:10.460 --> 10:16.600]  Well, you would think, but like, you would think Now You See Me 2 would be called Now You Don't, but it's just Now You See Me 2.
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.780]  But also, Ratatouille is a thing where it's like, it's about a rat, and you're like, oh, okay.
[10:22.700 --> 10:27.680]  That's what Ratatouille means, or his name is Ratatouille, and it doesn't make anything to do with that.
[10:27.960 --> 10:31.500]  And it doesn't matter that it's called Ratatouille, except for like a dish.
[10:31.500 --> 10:36.700]  And that doesn't, I mean, really, like the payoff for the name is so bizarre that it doesn't matter.
[10:37.020 --> 10:38.560]  So you can just, you know, Ratatouille.
[10:38.680 --> 10:40.640]  I want it, Ratatouille is what I'm ready for.
[10:42.500 --> 10:45.700]  I watched Plane last night. I don't know, have you seen Plane?
[10:46.020 --> 10:47.840]  What is, is that the...
[10:47.840 --> 10:48.200]  It's a...
[10:49.120 --> 10:50.820]  It's the Gerard Butler movie?
[10:50.980 --> 10:51.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:51.400 --> 10:52.700]  I have not seen Plane.
[10:52.700 --> 10:52.980]  I watched Plane.
[10:53.220 --> 10:54.180]  No, that seems like...
[10:54.180 --> 10:54.640]  It's really good.
[10:54.760 --> 10:59.480]  It seems like, well, I don't know about that, but it seems like one that we would watch on the show.
[10:59.640 --> 11:00.520]  Like we would watch first.
[11:00.520 --> 11:05.260]  It does. It has that feel to it. It is surprisingly good for a movie called Plane.
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.020]  And I'm even more excited because they're making a sequel called Boat.
[11:09.440 --> 11:10.300]  No, are they really?
[11:10.620 --> 11:10.960]  It makes sense.
[11:11.320 --> 11:11.580]  Yeah.
[11:12.400 --> 11:13.800]  Okay, I think this is what we're missing.
[11:14.160 --> 11:16.560]  Alright, here we go. This is pest control, is that what it said?
[11:17.820 --> 11:19.360]  Uh, I didn't even read it.
[11:19.380 --> 11:20.260]  Great, man. Hell yeah.
[11:20.360 --> 11:22.120]  It was part three of something.
[11:22.580 --> 11:22.920]  Great.
[11:23.080 --> 11:23.620]  Doesn't matter.
[11:24.020 --> 11:26.380]  Gonna do some rat shit. It's all the same.
[11:26.420 --> 11:29.140]  This is the guide for you, the viewer, guys. This is...
[11:30.520 --> 11:33.200]  You never bought a Prima guide that just said, like, it's all the same?
[11:33.400 --> 11:33.580]  Right, yeah.
[11:33.720 --> 11:34.180]  It doesn't matter?
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.300]  It's a strategy guide that says, don't fucking worry about it. It's a fucking video game.
[11:40.460 --> 11:43.520]  Okay, remember, don't chase them. You just make your moves.
[11:44.260 --> 11:47.900]  Wow, that actually maybe benefited you to die and respawn there.
[11:48.820 --> 11:49.420]  Very interesting.
[11:49.440 --> 11:51.860]  Yeah, I was hoping I could bounce off the sides.
[11:51.880 --> 11:54.480]  Yeah, I mean, that would make it cool, but that's not what this is.
[11:54.580 --> 11:55.720]  You're almost done also.
[11:56.360 --> 11:57.480]  Yeah, it's easy.
[11:57.480 --> 11:58.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:59.920 --> 12:00.340]  Easy.
[12:00.900 --> 12:03.500]  Thought you were going right off the edge right after you said that.
[12:04.880 --> 12:07.680]  I, uh... I always wondered who wrote those guides.
[12:08.380 --> 12:10.120]  Because I feel like they came out at launch.
[12:10.320 --> 12:10.540]  Yeah.
[12:10.700 --> 12:13.140]  But I don't think the companies that made the games made them.
[12:13.140 --> 12:14.220]  No, no, not at all.
[12:14.580 --> 12:15.080]  Ooh, Basil.
[12:17.360 --> 12:18.440]  Are you a Basil guy?
[12:18.860 --> 12:24.340]  Uh, in some things, not a lot. It's not something I keep around very often.
[12:24.740 --> 12:27.860]  But I love it on, like, a Caprice, which is very nice. I like it.
[12:28.280 --> 12:28.480]  Yeah.
[12:29.080 --> 12:31.760]  It's always a thing where it's like, you can plant your own, you can have it whenever you want.
[12:31.840 --> 12:34.160]  It's like, I want this so infrequently that, no.
[12:34.300 --> 12:38.160]  If I could plant, like, a mozzarella tree, I'd be going crazy, you know what I mean?
[12:39.080 --> 12:40.620]  A mozzarella tree? Oh, man.
[12:40.740 --> 12:43.480]  Yeah. Well, if you could plant an ingredient tree, what would it be?
[12:44.080 --> 12:46.500]  Like, it can't be, like, pizza tree. That's, like, a whole dish.
[12:46.560 --> 12:47.400]  Like, what's your ingredient?
[12:47.560 --> 12:47.840]  Yeah.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.280]  That you'd be like, oh, I gotta go pluck my mozzarella.
[12:51.760 --> 12:54.400]  Oh, mozzarella. A mozzarella tree is really hard to be.
[12:54.440 --> 12:55.200]  That's what I'm saying.
[12:56.740 --> 12:59.480]  Uh, I mean, like, immediately potatoes come to mind.
[12:59.700 --> 13:00.840]  I think we're just gonna leave this level.
[13:01.040 --> 13:04.160]  Yeah, I mean, now I will say, potato's already a thing that you can grow.
[13:04.760 --> 13:06.440]  I know, that's the problem.
[13:07.640 --> 13:10.360]  But it's, you know, you have to go into the ground for them.
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.300]  Yeah, I mean, I guess, I mean, like, I would just say, like, pick your favorite preparation of potato,
[13:15.440 --> 13:17.400]  and you could, like, probably make that into a tree.
[13:17.560 --> 13:19.260]  And you have, like, a chip tree, you know what I mean?
[13:20.500 --> 13:20.820]  Yeah.
[13:21.660 --> 13:24.680]  You know, a lot of the things I would go for are already in tree form.
[13:24.960 --> 13:26.660]  Oh, you're a big tree food guy.
[13:27.260 --> 13:30.840]  I think I'm a big tree food guy. I never thought about that before.
[13:31.800 --> 13:33.260]  Get all my food from trees.
[13:35.660 --> 13:38.740]  I had to pick one form of way. How do I get down?
[13:38.840 --> 13:40.400]  I was just about to say, what are you doing?
[13:40.720 --> 13:42.760]  Let's go down. I'm trying to figure out how to get down.
[13:42.760 --> 13:44.840]  Yeah, I think you gotta go down those lines, yeah. I think that's it.
[13:45.900 --> 13:47.340]  Um, yeah, I think I'd go tree.
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.700]  You get a lot of good things out of trees.
[13:49.700 --> 13:52.600]  And then there are things that you're surprised to learn are tree-based.
[13:53.580 --> 13:55.440]  Yeah, I mean, like, it's like when you see, like, cashews.
[13:55.720 --> 13:58.860]  And you go, well, that's certainly, like, the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.200]  Oh, don't forget, I think one of the, um, one of the achievements that we can get here
[14:04.200 --> 14:06.580]  is blow up a cat with a pepper.
[14:06.780 --> 14:08.800]  Which we've done already, but we didn't get the achievement for.
[14:10.320 --> 14:11.140]  We'll try it again.
[14:11.280 --> 14:12.400]  Okay. I'm into that.
[14:13.100 --> 14:15.620]  Again, that's the point, is getting these people the achievements.
[14:15.740 --> 14:17.540]  As Achievement Hunter, we have...
[14:17.540 --> 14:19.220]  As Achievement Hunter, I'm sorry, I misspoke.
[14:19.300 --> 14:19.960]  As Achievement Hunters...
[14:19.960 --> 14:20.740]  We don't own that IP.
[14:20.880 --> 14:27.060]  Yeah, as Achievement Hunters, we, uh, you know, we want to show you guys what it is, what it takes.
[14:27.940 --> 14:31.900]  Just as a thought, do you think that there's a thing where, like, when doing these time challenges,
[14:32.060 --> 14:33.560]  they spawn specific coins?
[14:33.900 --> 14:34.520]  No, no way.
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.020]  Like, in that instance of the level?
[14:36.260 --> 14:37.240]  No, I don't think so.
[14:37.780 --> 14:39.880]  And also, you've already done it, and you got them.
[14:41.480 --> 14:43.960]  Yeah, I just don't know where else those coins would be.
[14:44.080 --> 14:44.660]  Yeah, me neither.
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.020]  I've been everywhere, I feel.
[14:49.260 --> 14:50.760]  Yes, I definitely agree with that.
[14:50.840 --> 14:52.680]  And, oh, and we found one coin.
[14:54.800 --> 14:56.860]  Maybe, uh, there's stuff we're missing still.
[14:57.220 --> 14:58.060]  What could it be, though?
[14:58.060 --> 15:01.500]  Maybe you're right. Maybe, maybe it's a mix of two things. Maybe we'll, uh...
[15:01.500 --> 15:03.740]  Maybe you think you come back here later and something happens?
[15:04.240 --> 15:07.760]  Honestly, with it being ten missing, I feel more confident in that.
[15:08.120 --> 15:10.980]  Ten feel, yeah, I feel way better that we got all of the...
[15:10.980 --> 15:14.280]  Wait, so trash cans will move and we'll be able to do that. Are you gonna go blow up the cat?
[15:14.320 --> 15:14.620]  Yeah.
[15:15.800 --> 15:16.360]  Uh, yep.
[15:16.360 --> 15:17.780]  Just gotta go over there.
[15:19.720 --> 15:20.460]  This is good.
[15:20.700 --> 15:21.660]  Fuckin' mud walk.
[15:21.680 --> 15:22.780]  Look at him fuckin' walk.
[15:27.200 --> 15:28.140]  Muddy little fuckin' team.
[15:28.140 --> 15:29.960]  I wonder how many people it took to do that.
[15:30.300 --> 15:30.820]  Yeah, really.
[15:30.940 --> 15:32.640]  Like, what was the team? Was it one person?
[15:33.380 --> 15:34.800]  You just animate the fuck out of it.
[15:35.280 --> 15:35.520]  Oh.
[15:36.300 --> 15:37.400]  I don't think we've done this.
[15:37.840 --> 15:38.200]  What's that?
[15:38.200 --> 15:38.620]  I forgot about this.
[15:38.620 --> 15:40.660]  Really? A springboard race?
[15:40.660 --> 15:40.980]  I don't think we've done this.
[15:41.400 --> 15:41.800]  Okay.
[15:43.780 --> 15:45.080]  Do you remember doing this?
[15:45.080 --> 15:46.980]  I loaded this and went, I don't remember doing this.
[15:46.980 --> 15:47.780]  No, I don't remember this at all.
[15:47.800 --> 15:48.720]  I don't think I did this.
[15:48.860 --> 15:49.380]  Nope! Okay.
[15:50.440 --> 15:51.400]  There you go. You're good, you're good.
[15:51.460 --> 15:52.680]  Lock it in, lock it in.
[15:52.680 --> 15:55.180]  Just have confidence. You don't need the double jump for everything. Just have confidence.
[15:55.300 --> 15:56.360]  You got it. I believe in you.
[15:56.780 --> 15:57.640]  There you go.
[15:57.760 --> 15:58.240]  Oh, that was easy.
[15:58.520 --> 15:58.980]  You did it.
[15:59.040 --> 15:59.600]  Hell yeah!
[15:59.600 --> 16:01.020]  Congratulations, you won ten fuckin' charms.
[16:01.020 --> 16:01.420]  Ten coins!
[16:01.880 --> 16:03.160]  That's what I'm talking about.
[16:03.500 --> 16:11.840]  And guys, that's how you get 100% on the City of Lights level on Ratatouille 2007 for Xbox 360.
[16:12.420 --> 16:14.860]  Oh, when we're done with the City of Lights, we did it all.
[16:14.860 --> 16:15.840]  Yep, yep.
[16:16.020 --> 16:16.780]  Hell yeah!
[16:17.360 --> 16:17.600]  We roll.
[16:17.820 --> 16:21.440]  Okay, so let's actually, let's pull up the achievements and look at that blowing up a cat thing.
[16:23.100 --> 16:25.260]  11 of 50, we're making some progress.
[16:28.880 --> 16:31.040]  Where's the, use the chili pepper against the cat.
[16:31.300 --> 16:32.260]  That's what I'm saying!
[16:34.460 --> 16:36.040]  I'm saying we have to do that.
[16:36.880 --> 16:38.060]  Yeah, it is here, you're right.
[16:39.540 --> 16:39.980]  Uh...
[16:39.980 --> 16:42.520]  As an achievement hunter, we have to.
[16:42.520 --> 16:47.580]  I just don't know which cat they mean, because we certainly did this.
[16:47.680 --> 16:49.600]  There's a bunch of cats, you just gotta blow one of them up.
[16:50.380 --> 16:53.760]  I think maybe we did it on a different level.
[16:55.180 --> 16:57.580]  No, we definitely done this one. We've only played this one.
[16:58.640 --> 16:59.520]  We blew up this cat.
[16:59.620 --> 17:02.060]  Okay, now I will say, very good point.
[17:04.300 --> 17:06.240]  Done, we did it. Achievement time, baby.
[17:10.100 --> 17:10.500]  Achievement?
[17:10.560 --> 17:10.940]  Achievement.
[17:12.320 --> 17:12.940]  Achievement time?
[17:13.240 --> 17:13.880]  Achievement time, baby.
[17:15.920 --> 17:17.420]  Let's just blow up all the cats.
[17:17.980 --> 17:18.680]  Yeah, just in case.
[17:19.780 --> 17:20.980]  Get over here, get over here.
[17:21.480 --> 17:21.820]  Fuck.
[17:23.440 --> 17:24.640]  There's no way you're in range.
[17:24.920 --> 17:25.260]  Fuck.
[17:25.380 --> 17:26.440]  There's no way you're in range.
[17:26.440 --> 17:27.280]  Can I jump?
[17:28.300 --> 17:29.600]  Or is there one down here?
[17:30.080 --> 17:31.380]  There's a pepper down here, right?
[17:31.460 --> 17:32.180]  I think so.
[17:32.280 --> 17:32.700]  There it is.
[17:34.060 --> 17:35.580]  You're the active gamer, I don't know.
[17:37.280 --> 17:38.560]  I'm the full spectrum order.
[17:38.580 --> 17:39.340]  Active gamers.
[17:42.540 --> 17:44.120]  What a tag team duo.
[17:44.560 --> 17:46.760]  The active gamer and the full spectrum warrior.
[17:48.420 --> 17:49.840]  There you go, there you go, you got him.
[17:50.600 --> 17:51.720]  I mean, it has to be.
[17:52.120 --> 17:54.140]  Oh, he's trying to run.
[17:54.740 --> 17:55.560]  That's kind of sad.
[17:55.740 --> 17:57.460]  Do you think he has to be like, dazed?
[17:58.840 --> 17:59.700]  I don't know.
[17:59.980 --> 18:02.180]  I mean, there's no specific mention of that.
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.620]  Does the thing say more than one cat?
[18:05.840 --> 18:07.860]  No, it just says kill the cat.
[18:09.240 --> 18:11.300]  Maybe it's the asshole in the other area.
[18:13.040 --> 18:15.460]  But let's just be thorough at this point.
[18:15.560 --> 18:16.380]  We've killed two of them.
[18:16.520 --> 18:17.780]  I think there's one over here, isn't there?
[18:18.360 --> 18:20.680]  Or is it just the one in the main walkway now?
[18:21.140 --> 18:21.420]  I don't...
[18:21.420 --> 18:22.880]  I guess it's just the one in the walkway.
[18:23.460 --> 18:23.820]  Yeah.
[18:25.780 --> 18:27.600]  Well, if this doesn't work...
[18:27.600 --> 18:27.680]  Yeah.
[18:29.380 --> 18:30.500]  I think we're fucked.
[18:31.820 --> 18:32.920]  It might just be broken.
[18:34.120 --> 18:36.740]  But maybe we just come back later and maybe there's a different cat.
[18:37.520 --> 18:39.080]  A different cat appears.
[18:40.700 --> 18:42.840]  Yeah, you gotta blow up the cat in the post-game.
[18:42.980 --> 18:43.940]  It's a post-game cat.
[18:44.140 --> 18:44.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:44.680 --> 18:45.720]  It's after you get...
[18:45.720 --> 18:47.740]  After you get done, you get the...
[18:47.740 --> 18:51.520]  You get the special armor for Remy, and then you can blow up the cat.
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.860]  You get a prestige at least twice as Remy, and then the main cat appears.
[18:58.060 --> 18:58.080]  Okay.
[19:00.200 --> 19:01.940]  I'm just gonna keep slapping him.
[19:03.540 --> 19:03.940]  Okay.
[19:05.380 --> 19:06.180]  Jesus Christ.
[19:06.180 --> 19:08.600]  It's so graphic every time.
[19:09.540 --> 19:10.200]  Still no achievement.
[19:11.160 --> 19:12.040]  I don't understand.
[19:13.520 --> 19:15.700]  Yeah, I don't know what we're supposed to do.
[19:16.320 --> 19:17.180]  Because that's...
[19:18.260 --> 19:19.240]  That's all the cats.
[19:19.600 --> 19:19.980]  Yeah.
[19:24.390 --> 19:25.690]  Blow up the cat.
[19:25.990 --> 19:27.130]  That's what it says?
[19:28.850 --> 19:30.890]  Do you wanna maybe pull up a guide really quickly?
[19:31.030 --> 19:31.350]  Do you wanna look it up?
[19:31.350 --> 19:33.490]  I mean, we're the guide, but also, yeah, I'm already...
[19:33.490 --> 19:33.710]  Yeah.
[19:33.850 --> 19:35.370]  But yes, I'm already doing that.
[19:36.130 --> 19:37.990]  Let me find the name of it.
[19:37.990 --> 19:39.070]  What's the name of the achievement?
[19:40.130 --> 19:42.990]  It is Special Delivery Ratatouille.
[19:47.120 --> 19:50.660]  Use the chili pepper against the cat in the City of Lights.
[19:53.780 --> 19:56.720]  Anything else City of Lights related? Not that I can see.
[20:00.900 --> 20:03.280]  It's just the description of it.
[20:04.660 --> 20:06.660]  There's no like, hey, you gotta...
[20:07.300 --> 20:08.000]  I'm looking.
[20:09.120 --> 20:09.500]  Okay.
[20:10.560 --> 20:12.800]  While you look, get more info.
[20:13.120 --> 20:14.940]  I'm gonna exit the sewer.
[20:16.340 --> 20:17.900]  Which I forgot you could do from the pause.
[20:19.900 --> 20:22.920]  I've been running around trying to find the specific point.
[20:23.440 --> 20:25.940]  Okay. People are saying this is missable.
[20:27.660 --> 20:28.500]  Oh no!
[20:29.500 --> 20:32.720]  Special Delivery. Use the chili pepper on the cat in City of Lights.
[20:32.900 --> 20:38.220]  This is actually gained on the Little Chef Big Kitchen level during the mission Magnet Mustard.
[20:38.220 --> 20:41.020]  You will be going back to City of Lights!
[20:41.360 --> 20:45.480]  You will pass a skylight with two cats on the left and a third cat in the air duct.
[20:45.760 --> 20:47.300]  Collect the chili pepper from the air duct.
[20:47.660 --> 20:50.060]  You should see a place to put it in green.
[20:50.220 --> 20:52.120]  That will activate it and that's how you do it.
[20:52.320 --> 20:55.100]  Boom. So we do come back to City of Lights.
[20:55.520 --> 21:00.280]  So, it's time to go to our... finally, go to another level.
[21:00.720 --> 21:01.540]  We are doing it.
[21:02.740 --> 21:04.940]  Andrew just has to figure out how to go to another level.
[21:04.940 --> 21:07.400]  We gotta figure out where the next level is.
[21:08.960 --> 21:10.060]  It's not that way.
[21:11.200 --> 21:15.520]  Yeah, I mean this looks promising. We got a ball.
[21:20.400 --> 21:22.440]  I'm hitting it. I'm hitting it.
[21:23.180 --> 21:23.620]  There we go.
[21:26.680 --> 21:27.960]  Yeah baby, there you go!
[21:28.800 --> 21:29.600]  What do we got? What do we got?
[21:30.740 --> 21:32.480]  Little Chef Big Kitchen!
[21:34.620 --> 21:35.200]  Hell yeah.
[21:38.220 --> 21:42.440]  Hoisting the hefty weight. Lift the weight off the scale so Git can move it.
[21:42.580 --> 21:43.480]  Okay, who's Git?
[21:43.960 --> 21:45.100]  Latch key distraction.
[21:48.680 --> 21:52.220]  I think it's weird that there's a check on all these like I've already done them.
[21:54.880 --> 21:56.260]  Alright, let's... I'm ready.
[21:56.360 --> 21:58.860]  Wait, did we do this? Is that why there were checks?
[21:59.180 --> 21:59.520]  No.
[22:01.200 --> 22:03.980]  Because we did do the thing where we're popping in and out with the chef.
[22:04.280 --> 22:06.260]  It's true, but I...
[22:06.260 --> 22:07.780]  But I don't think it was here, was it?
[22:10.120 --> 22:10.480]  No.
[22:10.820 --> 22:11.700]  This fucking game.
[22:12.940 --> 22:15.240]  They did so much and so little simultaneously.
[22:15.240 --> 22:16.560]  I agree. Oh, we have not been here.
[22:16.680 --> 22:18.100]  Okay, zero of a hundred. Great.
[22:18.280 --> 22:20.380]  Yep. Yeah. Great.
[22:20.540 --> 22:21.460]  Oh, this looks like a mess.
[22:21.660 --> 22:21.920]  Yeah.
[22:23.020 --> 22:25.780]  Oh, I'm gonna run like a real fucking idiot on that.
[22:25.980 --> 22:26.300]  Uh-huh.
[22:26.360 --> 22:27.080]  Whatever that was.
[22:27.080 --> 22:27.840]  Yeah, it's gonna be bad.
[22:28.100 --> 22:28.460]  Syrup.
[22:33.720 --> 22:34.640]  Oh my god.
[22:34.760 --> 22:35.800]  Oh, this is kind of dizzying.
[22:35.980 --> 22:36.060]  Oh boy.
[22:36.940 --> 22:37.860]  This is gonna be it.
[22:39.360 --> 22:40.720]  Who are we right now?
[22:41.440 --> 22:42.540]  What is this camera?
[22:43.240 --> 22:45.800]  Uh, it's just giving you an overview, ghost style.
[22:45.980 --> 22:47.100]  Because it's through the eyes of the ghost.
[22:47.200 --> 22:48.340]  Oh, maybe we're the ghost.
[22:48.540 --> 22:49.780]  Yeah, I think you're Gaston or whatever.
[22:54.600 --> 22:56.460]  Oh shit, we got crabs.
[22:58.440 --> 22:58.840]  Oh.
[23:00.300 --> 23:01.920]  Oh, fucking... Bring it. Bring it.
[23:02.780 --> 23:05.320]  Yeah, eat shit. Eat shit. Spin. Spin.
[23:05.600 --> 23:06.440]  That's awesome.
[23:06.760 --> 23:07.460]  Dumbass crab.
[23:07.900 --> 23:10.000]  Do you think there's an achievement for blowing up the crab?
[23:11.340 --> 23:12.340]  There better be.
[23:13.760 --> 23:14.560]  Oh, fuck.
[23:15.400 --> 23:15.540]  Uh-oh.
[23:15.540 --> 23:16.420]  Oh, get away crab.
[23:16.600 --> 23:17.280]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[23:17.560 --> 23:18.200]  There's a lot happening.
[23:18.300 --> 23:18.680]  Run!
[23:19.460 --> 23:19.860]  Ah!
[23:22.300 --> 23:23.100]  Stupid chef.
[23:23.540 --> 23:24.380]  Go faster.
[23:26.540 --> 23:27.380]  Why are we...
[23:27.380 --> 23:29.340]  Why are you slow, you're a ghost.
[23:29.520 --> 23:30.020]  There we go.
[23:31.840 --> 23:32.700]  There we go.
[23:33.060 --> 23:35.000]  Yeah, let's...
[23:35.000 --> 23:35.880]  Go through here.
[23:35.960 --> 23:36.740]  Give me that coin.
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.440]  Do we get things for doing this? I don't even remember what the reward is for.
[23:43.440 --> 23:46.280]  We probably get like a coin or some kind of thing.
[23:46.840 --> 23:49.300]  We're also collecting these blue coins as we go.
[23:49.580 --> 23:50.780]  Holy fuck.
[23:50.800 --> 23:51.940]  Oh my fucking god.
[23:52.220 --> 23:54.180]  You're gonna get fucking ditched. You better go.
[23:55.960 --> 23:57.120]  Go, you're gonna get ditched.
[23:58.660 --> 23:59.540]  I'm trying.
[24:00.220 --> 24:02.040]  You're getting too far away.
[24:02.500 --> 24:02.680]  Shut up.
[24:03.200 --> 24:06.280]  First of all, it's you. What do you mean he's getting too far away?
[24:06.340 --> 24:09.180]  You're the one that's getting away. Just stop getting away.
[24:09.180 --> 24:11.300]  You gotta get that coin. You gotta go back and get that coin.
[24:11.460 --> 24:12.920]  Oh no, you're gonna have to redo that.
[24:13.020 --> 24:15.640]  How am I gonna... I gotta climb up the fucking broom?
[24:15.660 --> 24:16.420]  Yeah, I think so.
[24:17.120 --> 24:18.120]  Look at what you did.
[24:18.220 --> 24:18.740]  You failed the mission.
[24:18.760 --> 24:19.480]  Look at what you did.
[24:20.520 --> 24:21.300]  You did that.
[24:21.380 --> 24:22.180]  I think you blew it.
[24:22.780 --> 24:23.640]  That was you.
[24:23.780 --> 24:25.080]  Yeah, you fucking messed up, dude.
[24:25.460 --> 24:26.380]  Okay, we're locking in.
[24:27.800 --> 24:32.620]  I hate that he has us go all around when really he just wants us to climb up something to the left.
[24:32.740 --> 24:38.180]  Yeah, but here's the thing. We already got some of those blue coins, so now you can focus on getting that one blue coin.
[24:39.180 --> 24:40.840]  Yeah, well, I gotta... by doing this.
[24:42.060 --> 24:42.500]  Shut up.
[24:42.720 --> 24:42.940]  No!
[24:43.640 --> 24:44.580]  Look at what you did.
[24:44.600 --> 24:46.320]  I hate... I hate this game.
[24:46.360 --> 24:46.940]  Look at what you did.
[24:47.180 --> 24:47.900]  I fucking hate this game.
[24:48.240 --> 24:49.880]  No. Okay, we're getting it this time.
[24:50.420 --> 24:52.140]  I'm locked in. I'm gonna get on that broom.
[24:52.240 --> 24:52.380]  Okay.
[24:52.660 --> 24:54.300]  I'm an underground gamer right now.
[24:54.300 --> 24:55.800]  You are. It's true. You're truly underground.
[24:55.940 --> 24:56.800]  I live in the sewers.
[24:57.120 --> 24:57.440]  Uh-huh.
[24:57.760 --> 24:59.560]  My rep is below 50%.
[24:59.560 --> 25:00.520]  Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[25:00.960 --> 25:01.700]  Okay, here it is. Boom!
[25:01.860 --> 25:03.200]  Okay, you didn't go to do it.
[25:03.340 --> 25:04.020]  Sneak around.
[25:04.440 --> 25:06.240]  No, no, I can't. I'm gonna get it on the wrapper.
[25:06.260 --> 25:08.040]  Oh, you're gonna do it normal style.
[25:08.040 --> 25:09.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:09.120 --> 25:09.580]  I'm gonna do it normal style.
[25:09.580 --> 25:12.080]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought I was talking to an underground gamer.
[25:12.280 --> 25:14.420]  I didn't... I didn't realize that you...
[25:14.420 --> 25:15.640]  I didn't realize you play by the rules.
[25:16.900 --> 25:19.260]  I don't, but I'm making my own rules.
[25:19.560 --> 25:19.760]  Okay.
[25:21.280 --> 25:22.020]  That's what I'm doing.
[25:22.100 --> 25:22.360]  Okay.
[25:23.740 --> 25:24.820]  Watch this. Bam!
[25:25.660 --> 25:25.920]  Nice, there you go.
[25:25.920 --> 25:28.080]  There's a coin to the left I wish I could get, but I can't.
[25:29.320 --> 25:30.240]  You think you can get up there?
[25:30.320 --> 25:30.860]  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.
[25:32.280 --> 25:32.900]  There you go.
[25:32.980 --> 25:33.780]  Fuck yeah. Boom.
[25:33.900 --> 25:34.220]  Easy.
[25:34.760 --> 25:35.040]  Boom.
[25:36.540 --> 25:37.720]  That's why you're the active gamer.
[25:37.720 --> 25:41.000]  Did you ever see the, uh, clip of the Jaguars lady?
[25:41.660 --> 25:44.540]  When they were, like, it's probably ten years old at this point, I gotta go up.
[25:44.740 --> 25:44.940]  Fuck.
[25:45.480 --> 25:51.900]  Uh, when they asked her about the Jags, and she said the reason they've been losing is they've been following the rules.
[25:52.240 --> 25:53.720]  Oh no, that's awesome.
[25:55.060 --> 25:56.660]  Dude, you gotta jump on that. Hit the button!
[25:57.660 --> 25:58.420]  I'm hitting the button!
[25:58.420 --> 25:59.180]  Hit the land button!
[25:59.980 --> 26:00.740]  Now go!
[26:02.160 --> 26:03.140]  Oh my god.
[26:04.200 --> 26:05.040]  Alright, there's the last...
[26:05.040 --> 26:06.320]  I'm not supposed to be up here.
[26:06.320 --> 26:08.180]  That's that last... there's that coin up there.
[26:08.740 --> 26:10.060]  And then there's the coin over to the right.
[26:10.080 --> 26:11.240]  I'm not supposed to be up here.
[26:12.140 --> 26:13.280]  You got it, you got it. Get these last two.
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.000]  Eric, I'm not supposed to be here.
[26:15.200 --> 26:16.460]  And then, and then, there you go. Minigame unlock.
[26:16.520 --> 26:17.240]  Oh, there's one back there!
[26:17.520 --> 26:19.820]  Wow. Oh, there you go. There you go, there you go.
[26:19.880 --> 26:20.860]  Where the fuck is he?
[26:20.860 --> 26:21.960]  He's down there. Float, baby!
[26:23.060 --> 26:23.620]  I'm going!
[26:24.360 --> 26:24.640]  Hurry!
[26:25.900 --> 26:26.380]  I'm moving.
[26:26.380 --> 26:27.800]  This is what happens when you play by the rules.
[26:28.320 --> 26:29.320]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[26:30.520 --> 26:31.680]  Jaguar style. Go get that one to the right!
[26:31.800 --> 26:33.220]  Oh, you missed it. You're gonna have to do this again.
[26:33.600 --> 26:35.240]  I got... no, we're not doing this again.
[26:35.240 --> 26:35.920]  Yeah, you're gonna have to.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.060]  These coins will still be here.
[26:37.140 --> 26:37.660]  I don't think so.
[26:38.820 --> 26:39.240]  Yeah.
[26:39.660 --> 26:40.120]  Missed that one.
[26:40.300 --> 26:42.540]  Absolutely. We literally just had to talk about this in the last level.
[26:44.040 --> 26:44.880]  Shut up.
[26:46.240 --> 26:47.560]  What? What the fuck?
[26:47.600 --> 26:49.200]  I hate that I have to hold A.
[26:50.040 --> 26:51.300]  Just let me launch.
[26:53.020 --> 26:54.280]  You're getting too far away!
[26:54.880 --> 26:56.540]  I hate this game.
[26:56.980 --> 26:58.520]  How long is this?
[26:58.960 --> 26:59.920]  What are we doing?
[26:59.980 --> 27:00.420]  Go up, go up, go up!
[27:00.780 --> 27:01.410]  I'm trying!
[27:01.840 --> 27:02.300]  Go up!
[27:03.200 --> 27:04.540]  I'm working on it.
[27:04.540 --> 27:05.400]  There we go.
[27:06.480 --> 27:07.040]  Jesus Christ.
[27:09.200 --> 27:10.100]  Yeah, you did it!
[27:11.400 --> 27:11.500]  Yeah!
[27:11.640 --> 27:12.700]  And you won ten charms.
[27:14.500 --> 27:19.040]  Dude, look at... that guy's head is what I looked like when I was like six months old.
[27:19.180 --> 27:20.220]  That baby photo of me?
[27:20.320 --> 27:20.820]  That was me.
[27:20.860 --> 27:21.680]  That's exactly what it looked like.
[27:21.680 --> 27:22.740]  This is me in another life.
[27:24.560 --> 27:26.940]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I think you gotta go that way because I think there's one up there.
[27:27.040 --> 27:27.520]  There's one up there.
[27:27.740 --> 27:28.280]  There's a blue coin.
[27:28.660 --> 27:29.520]  You think there's in here?
[27:29.900 --> 27:30.560]  Over to the right.
[27:32.180 --> 27:32.740]  Oh, hell yeah.
[27:32.920 --> 27:33.460]  Good call.
[27:33.460 --> 27:37.820]  Yeah, it's because I remember how the levels laid out and I also remember the ones you didn't get.
[27:41.180 --> 27:43.800]  So there are ones down low, right, where you're like, go low, go low.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.540]  I believe so, but not right here.
[27:46.580 --> 27:47.060]  Oh, down there.
[27:47.060 --> 27:47.360]  Yeah, right here.
[27:47.500 --> 27:47.860]  There you go.
[27:48.220 --> 27:48.820]  Couple of them.
[27:48.940 --> 27:49.320]  Look at that.
[27:49.400 --> 27:49.740]  Grab them.
[27:51.240 --> 27:51.820]  Boom, baby.
[27:52.580 --> 27:53.540]  Just win, baby.
[27:55.160 --> 27:58.700]  That's why with my draft pick, I draft Michael Penix Jr.
[27:59.580 --> 28:02.140]  And we are going to be a better podcast for it.
[28:02.140 --> 28:09.000]  I know we have five podcasters already, but this guy, he's going to make a strong podcast guy in about four years.
[28:09.200 --> 28:11.180]  That's the method that I'm going for.
[28:11.380 --> 28:12.260]  I feel good about it.
[28:12.400 --> 28:15.380]  I feel good about our podcast pipeline method.
[28:18.400 --> 28:21.640]  I feel way better than the Suns do about their podcast pipeline.
[28:21.640 --> 28:22.940]  Oh, my God.
[28:23.380 --> 28:23.840]  Dude.
[28:24.360 --> 28:25.460]  What the fuck?
[28:26.320 --> 28:28.600]  They have one pick between now and 23.
[28:28.740 --> 28:28.980]  Yep.
[28:29.240 --> 28:29.960]  It's insane.
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.840]  Which is good, because, you know, they're so well put together that, like, you know, they don't even need it.
[28:36.460 --> 28:38.840]  You know, everything's just working for them, so it's fine.
[28:40.380 --> 28:42.260]  Kevin Durant is one of those people...
[28:42.260 --> 28:44.000]  I don't want to start the mission, I'm still doing coins.
[28:44.060 --> 28:44.220]  Yep.
[28:45.480 --> 28:48.720]  If you told me he was 27 or 48, I would believe both.
[28:48.720 --> 28:49.500]  Believe you either way.
[28:50.060 --> 28:50.420]  100%.
[28:50.920 --> 28:51.500]  Absolutely agree with you.
[28:51.700 --> 28:56.260]  He's been there forever, but, like, I have no idea how to gauge his age, because...
[28:56.260 --> 28:56.420]  Yep.
[28:57.080 --> 28:57.620]  Uh-oh.
[28:58.120 --> 28:59.160]  Put me back at the start.
[28:59.160 --> 28:59.580]  It's fine.
[28:59.760 --> 29:00.640]  It saved, right?
[29:00.780 --> 29:01.660]  Okay, cool, you got 37.
[29:01.800 --> 29:02.080]  That's good.
[29:03.440 --> 29:04.800]  How old is Kevin Durant?
[29:05.580 --> 29:06.340]  I have no idea.
[29:07.260 --> 29:08.040]  Let's take a guess.
[29:08.100 --> 29:08.740]  I'll look it up.
[29:08.880 --> 29:09.680]  I'll guess also.
[29:09.820 --> 29:11.240]  I'm gonna guess it's between...
[29:11.240 --> 29:13.640]  I'm gonna say that he is, like, 36.
[29:14.060 --> 29:14.300]  Okay.
[29:14.760 --> 29:16.660]  Yeah, he's gotta be younger than LeBron, right?
[29:16.680 --> 29:17.520]  But not by much.
[29:18.840 --> 29:19.580]  Around there, yeah.
[29:19.820 --> 29:21.060]  I'll say he's 35.
[29:21.180 --> 29:22.740]  What the fuck are these?
[29:22.840 --> 29:23.980]  He is 35 years old.
[29:24.060 --> 29:24.080]  What?
[29:24.080 --> 29:25.000]  He was born September 88.
[29:25.040 --> 29:25.840]  Nice call.
[29:26.340 --> 29:27.140]  I mean, it just...
[29:27.140 --> 29:27.760]  What is this?
[29:27.760 --> 29:28.660]  Oh my god, run!
[29:29.320 --> 29:31.040]  What was that blue thing over there?
[29:31.080 --> 29:31.460]  What is that?
[29:32.300 --> 29:32.620]  Oh!
[29:32.720 --> 29:33.580]  Oh, that's bonus content!
[29:33.920 --> 29:34.120]  Bonus!
[29:34.200 --> 29:34.400]  Bonus!
[29:34.460 --> 29:34.540]  Bonus!
[29:35.260 --> 29:35.980]  Oh no!
[29:37.200 --> 29:38.280]  Oh, fuck you!
[29:38.380 --> 29:39.520]  You have to go up.
[29:39.720 --> 29:41.460]  You have to go up and over, I think.
[29:43.600 --> 29:44.580]  How do I go?
[29:44.860 --> 29:45.180]  No.
[29:46.580 --> 29:47.580]  You gotta be able to...
[29:47.580 --> 29:50.000]  Oh, I think you gotta go back further to go up.
[29:50.080 --> 29:50.440]  There you go.
[29:50.480 --> 29:51.120]  There you go, baby.
[29:51.420 --> 29:52.220]  Just win, baby.
[29:52.240 --> 29:56.820]  I don't feel like that's the way that they wanted anyone to do this.
[29:56.820 --> 29:56.980]  No.
[29:57.300 --> 29:58.020]  Definitely not.
[29:58.300 --> 29:59.420]  Oh my god, what the fuck?
[29:59.440 --> 29:59.620]  Can I hit you?
[30:00.320 --> 30:01.100]  Yeah, but that's it.
[30:01.220 --> 30:02.220]  You have to blow him up with peppers.
[30:02.360 --> 30:02.920]  Maybe it's an achievement.
[30:05.460 --> 30:07.440]  But only if you do it on a specific machine.
[30:07.460 --> 30:09.300]  Yeah, it's absolutely a special one.
[30:09.520 --> 30:10.940]  It's a special squid in a cup.
[30:12.560 --> 30:14.700]  Wait, how come you can't do it now?
[30:15.100 --> 30:15.880]  What's going on?
[30:18.360 --> 30:19.180]  Wow, Jesus.
[30:19.620 --> 30:20.940]  I don't think you can go up there.
[30:21.040 --> 30:21.600]  Pixel perfect platformer.
[30:22.560 --> 30:24.120]  I don't think I'm supposed to.
[30:25.000 --> 30:25.820]  Maybe you're supposed to.
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.840]  Maybe if you do the springboard race.
[30:28.900 --> 30:29.960]  No, you had it.
[30:30.080 --> 30:30.380]  There you go.
[30:30.440 --> 30:30.600]  Nope.
[30:30.800 --> 30:31.460]  Okay, come on.
[30:31.860 --> 30:32.280]  There you go.
[30:32.380 --> 30:32.700]  There you go.
[30:32.780 --> 30:32.980]  Nope.
[30:33.160 --> 30:33.700]  Okay, hang on.
[30:33.780 --> 30:34.500]  Okay, here we go.
[30:34.620 --> 30:35.140]  And right.
[30:35.400 --> 30:35.540]  Nope.
[30:35.660 --> 30:36.160]  Not that way.
[30:36.280 --> 30:36.440]  Nope.
[30:36.600 --> 30:36.840]  Okay.
[30:37.140 --> 30:37.460]  Hang on.
[30:37.680 --> 30:37.820]  There.
[30:38.380 --> 30:38.620]  Okay.
[30:38.880 --> 30:39.480]  Then you're there.
[30:39.540 --> 30:40.140]  And then you're there!
[30:40.920 --> 30:41.240]  Easy.
[30:41.540 --> 30:41.760]  Easy.
[30:41.840 --> 30:42.140]  Relax.
[30:42.640 --> 30:43.100]  Calm down!
[30:43.340 --> 30:43.540]  Okay.
[30:43.540 --> 30:43.840]  Okay.
[30:44.180 --> 30:45.880]  Now you have to figure out how to get...
[30:45.880 --> 30:47.180]  Because I don't think it's about being the highest.
[30:47.400 --> 30:48.640]  It's about getting on there.
[30:48.920 --> 30:50.960]  I think you just have to make the jump from the table.
[30:51.200 --> 30:51.920]  I think that's it right there.
[30:52.620 --> 30:53.440]  Okay, let's line it up.
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.340]  Oh my god, the camera!
[30:55.840 --> 30:56.580]  It won't let me...
[30:58.040 --> 30:58.960]  Oh my god.
[30:59.460 --> 31:00.160]  And now I tilt.
[31:01.980 --> 31:03.200]  Doing it for the colony!
[31:03.480 --> 31:03.920]  For the colony.
[31:04.660 --> 31:05.200]  Grab it.
[31:05.400 --> 31:05.640]  Bonus!
[31:05.940 --> 31:07.160]  Bonus pack ten, baby!
[31:08.360 --> 31:08.720]  Nice.
[31:09.080 --> 31:09.360]  Okay.
[31:09.860 --> 31:10.380]  We run...
[31:10.380 --> 31:12.340]  We fucking run this, baby.
[31:14.260 --> 31:15.960]  Let's see if we can get some more coins.
[31:18.220 --> 31:22.040]  I want to kind of get as many coins as I can before touching any of the minigames.
[31:22.300 --> 31:24.920]  You want to get sort of like the lay of the land.
[31:25.720 --> 31:26.760]  Well, that's probably...
[31:26.760 --> 31:27.520]  That would have been helpful.
[31:27.620 --> 31:27.840]  Yeah.
[31:28.440 --> 31:29.220]  A minute ago.
[31:29.360 --> 31:29.560]  Yeah.
[31:29.700 --> 31:30.460]  We probably could have used that.
[31:30.620 --> 31:30.940]  Probably.
[31:31.420 --> 31:32.440]  I wonder if you were supposed to.
[31:34.840 --> 31:37.920]  But you don't need to, as we just established via this guide.
[31:41.000 --> 31:41.960]  Climb on this.
[31:43.040 --> 31:44.780]  Well, I just boiled myself to death.
[31:44.980 --> 31:46.380]  Yeah, I don't think you're...
[31:46.540 --> 31:47.600]  Someone's eating rat soup, baby.
[31:49.320 --> 31:50.520]  Would you eat rat soup?
[31:50.740 --> 31:51.740]  No, I don't think so.
[31:53.040 --> 31:55.900]  What if it was just called rat soup, but you didn't know what was in it?
[31:56.180 --> 31:58.960]  I would make some educated guesses and probably not eat it.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.400]  Listen, there's not rat in this rat soup.
[32:04.500 --> 32:05.700]  Hey, do you want some rat soup?
[32:05.900 --> 32:06.440]  What's in it?
[32:08.180 --> 32:08.560]  Um...
[32:08.560 --> 32:08.920]  Not rat.
[32:09.160 --> 32:09.280]  Um...
[32:09.280 --> 32:11.340]  I can't tell you, but...
[32:12.020 --> 32:12.400]  Well...
[32:12.400 --> 32:13.880]  Definitely not rat.
[32:14.340 --> 32:16.960]  Oh, you gotta jump on that thing and fucking tail whip it or something, right?
[32:18.580 --> 32:19.740]  I would say so.
[32:19.780 --> 32:20.560]  Yeah, it's blue.
[32:26.420 --> 32:27.440]  Wait, wait.
[32:27.520 --> 32:28.440]  Look back there.
[32:28.540 --> 32:29.500]  Oh, that's where you started.
[32:29.620 --> 32:29.840]  Never mind.
[32:30.500 --> 32:32.260]  I thought there was something to pick up.
[32:32.440 --> 32:32.740]  There was not.
[32:33.160 --> 32:33.540]  No.
[32:34.660 --> 32:35.500]  I'm gonna go back.
[32:35.560 --> 32:36.720]  I'm gonna get back on the ball.
[32:38.720 --> 32:40.260]  And we're just gonna try to get up.
[32:40.860 --> 32:41.520]  Yeah, you got this.
[32:41.680 --> 32:42.320]  I feel good.
[32:44.380 --> 32:45.820]  Let's get on this pad.
[32:45.920 --> 32:46.720]  Maybe the pad.
[32:50.980 --> 32:51.620]  Oh, oh, oh.
[32:51.740 --> 32:52.320]  Ooh, okay.
[32:53.620 --> 32:54.480]  There you go.
[32:54.940 --> 32:56.120]  And then there's a coin back there.
[32:56.240 --> 32:56.540]  Look at that.
[32:56.540 --> 32:57.200]  Let's go over there.
[32:57.200 --> 32:58.020]  Wow, easy.
[32:58.420 --> 32:59.580]  Fucking easy mode.
[33:01.360 --> 33:01.860]  Any other...
[33:01.860 --> 33:02.040]  Yep.
[33:02.140 --> 33:03.020]  Okay, to the right.
[33:05.880 --> 33:07.680]  Do you typically play games on normal?
[33:08.340 --> 33:08.980]  Yeah, always.
[33:09.900 --> 33:10.260]  Always?
[33:10.560 --> 33:19.080]  Like, I work a full-time job and I have like a mortgage and I don't want to have to replay a bunch of stuff over and over and over again.
[33:19.220 --> 33:21.740]  I just kind of like want to zone out and go like, this is fun.
[33:21.860 --> 33:23.080]  This is fun enough for me right now.
[33:23.160 --> 33:23.700]  I like this.
[33:24.180 --> 33:25.760]  That's like as much as I want to get video games.
[33:27.840 --> 33:29.020]  Where is this gonna...
[33:29.020 --> 33:29.800]  Oh my God.
[33:30.820 --> 33:31.180]  Wow.
[33:31.500 --> 33:32.120]  I'm not on it.
[33:32.140 --> 33:32.920]  No, you're not.
[33:33.220 --> 33:33.580]  Wow.
[33:34.080 --> 33:34.640]  You did not hit the...
[33:34.640 --> 33:35.640]  Yes, bonus content.
[33:35.880 --> 33:36.420]  Hell yeah.
[33:36.440 --> 33:38.060]  Guys, we got some bonus content just for you.
[33:38.060 --> 33:40.160]  Oh, grab that and then hang a left.
[33:40.240 --> 33:40.780]  Yep, that's it.
[33:40.900 --> 33:41.360]  Right there.
[33:42.740 --> 33:43.000]  Oh, wow.
[33:43.040 --> 33:43.860]  This is far.
[33:44.640 --> 33:45.480]  Okay, let's see.
[33:46.300 --> 33:46.920]  Let's do it, baby.
[33:47.520 --> 33:48.400]  You gotta keep going straight.
[33:48.920 --> 33:49.940]  I don't think...
[33:49.940 --> 33:50.400]  Oh, wow.
[33:50.500 --> 33:51.020]  Oh, wow.
[33:51.040 --> 33:51.820]  It gave it to you.
[33:52.120 --> 33:54.320]  That was honestly so nice of the game to give it to you.
[33:55.440 --> 33:55.760]  Okay.
[33:56.300 --> 33:56.760]  All the way.
[33:56.800 --> 33:57.520]  I feel that was earned.
[33:57.680 --> 33:58.180]  All right, there you go.
[33:58.320 --> 33:58.960]  Respectfully disagree.
[34:00.980 --> 34:01.960]  I'm an ace, okay?
[34:02.020 --> 34:02.520]  Me and Remy.
[34:02.700 --> 34:03.660]  I play aces.
[34:03.780 --> 34:04.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[34:04.340 --> 34:05.540]  Yeah, you guys look like aces.
[34:06.620 --> 34:08.260]  Me, Remy, and Snoopy.
[34:08.280 --> 34:08.700]  Snoopy, yeah.
[34:08.900 --> 34:10.560]  I figured Snoopy was in there somewhere.
[34:12.000 --> 34:12.520]  Had to be.
[34:12.600 --> 34:13.740]  Mm-hmm.
[34:13.960 --> 34:14.280]  Okay.
[34:14.440 --> 34:14.780]  All right.
[34:15.040 --> 34:17.560]  I think you just get this one and then you keep it moving.
[34:17.820 --> 34:18.920]  I don't think you get that one on the left.
[34:19.040 --> 34:19.800]  Just keep going forward.
[34:20.900 --> 34:22.120]  Yeah, I think it's a broom thing.
[34:22.180 --> 34:22.840]  I can climb later.
[34:23.020 --> 34:23.300]  It's fine.
[34:23.460 --> 34:24.800]  Ooh, you're not gonna get that.
[34:24.940 --> 34:25.080]  Oh.
[34:25.440 --> 34:25.760]  Oh!
[34:26.480 --> 34:27.160]  Look at that skill.
[34:27.300 --> 34:27.580]  That's a...
[34:27.580 --> 34:29.940]  You doubted the act of gamer.
[34:30.140 --> 34:30.580]  Honestly, that's a...
[34:30.580 --> 34:32.040]  Egg on your face.
[34:32.380 --> 34:33.760]  That's an act of gamer mood, baby.
[34:34.200 --> 34:34.620]  That was...
[34:34.620 --> 34:35.480]  You fucking showed me.
[34:35.580 --> 34:37.000]  All right, you gotta hop up there for sure.
[34:37.060 --> 34:37.380]  Let's go up.
[34:37.520 --> 34:37.680]  Yep.
[34:37.780 --> 34:37.980]  Yeah.
[34:38.360 --> 34:41.700]  I kinda wanna do this cakewalk thing just because I don't wanna have to do that.
[34:41.700 --> 34:42.260]  Yeah, you're already...
[34:42.260 --> 34:44.700]  I mean, you're already up here and then you don't have to...
[34:44.700 --> 34:45.200]  Ooh, nice.
[34:45.680 --> 34:45.920]  Okay.
[34:46.320 --> 34:47.640]  Oh, fuck, but then there's this.
[34:49.540 --> 34:51.120]  Yeah, but like your mini-game will finish and you'll be...
[34:51.120 --> 34:54.540]  I guess I'll do the cakewalk game and then I'll come back and then...
[34:57.150 --> 34:57.570]  What?
[34:57.710 --> 34:58.890]  Get me off the fucking rope.
[34:59.550 --> 35:00.410]  Let's do a cakewalk.
[35:00.510 --> 35:00.730]  Okay.
[35:00.990 --> 35:01.350]  Feel good.
[35:02.330 --> 35:04.330]  Do you think we're literally walking on a cake?
[35:04.330 --> 35:04.790]  Yeah, probably.
[35:04.970 --> 35:06.390]  I mean, I would think it's hyper-literal.
[35:06.390 --> 35:07.270]  It would be very literal.
[35:07.450 --> 35:08.170]  Yeah, I mean, it's Ratatouille.
[35:10.530 --> 35:11.110]  It's true.
[35:12.030 --> 35:13.090]  It is Ratatouille.
[35:13.330 --> 35:13.730]  It is.
[35:13.770 --> 35:14.230]  The whole time.
[35:14.310 --> 35:17.290]  In case you guys aren't aware, this is Ratatouille 2007 and this is your achievement.
[35:17.370 --> 35:19.430]  Avoid the falling cakes until...
[35:19.490 --> 35:19.770]  Okay.
[35:20.050 --> 35:20.910]  I didn't...
[35:20.910 --> 35:21.090]  This is not what I thought it would be.
[35:21.090 --> 35:22.930]  I thought you were running right into them.
[35:23.050 --> 35:23.570]  That's pretty cool.
[35:24.750 --> 35:25.310]  There you go.
[35:26.090 --> 35:27.630]  Why are the cakes...
[35:27.630 --> 35:28.070]  Left!
[35:29.590 --> 35:31.390]  Well, at least I'm a good cook.
[35:31.410 --> 35:32.370]  Now, I will say...
[35:32.370 --> 35:32.850]  That was...
[35:32.850 --> 35:35.490]  I will say, for someone talking shit, you died really fast.
[35:36.390 --> 35:39.770]  I was baffled by the fact that these cakes break into pieces.
[35:40.010 --> 35:40.130]  They do.
[35:40.370 --> 35:40.710]  For some reason.
[35:41.730 --> 35:44.410]  And also, why are we breaking cakes like this?
[35:44.430 --> 35:44.850]  I don't know.
[35:45.850 --> 35:47.010]  These could be delicious cakes, we'll never know.
[35:47.010 --> 35:49.170]  Also, all of these cakes look like shit.
[35:50.310 --> 35:51.510]  Yeah, they don't look very good.
[35:51.650 --> 35:51.870]  They're terrible.
[35:52.910 --> 35:57.510]  Like, the kind of main thing with animated food is it generally looks delicious.
[35:57.550 --> 35:57.890]  Oh, yeah.
[35:59.630 --> 36:00.030]  Nice.
[36:00.130 --> 36:01.090]  Now, I'm just gonna go here.
[36:01.230 --> 36:01.330]  There you go.
[36:02.790 --> 36:03.530]  You got it.
[36:03.710 --> 36:04.250]  You're locked in.
[36:04.290 --> 36:04.690]  You're locked in.
[36:04.690 --> 36:07.310]  It's sort of insane that this is a 60 second minigame.
[36:07.310 --> 36:09.250]  It's a really long time to be doing this.
[36:09.530 --> 36:10.810]  It's a lot of time.
[36:16.130 --> 36:16.930]  Oh, jeez.
[36:19.550 --> 36:19.950]  Nice.
[36:20.010 --> 36:20.790]  And a lot of time.
[36:21.110 --> 36:21.870]  No, you're good, you're good.
[36:22.390 --> 36:22.790]  Easy.
[36:23.790 --> 36:24.530]  10 more seconds?
[36:24.730 --> 36:25.370]  Yeah, you got it.
[36:26.530 --> 36:26.990]  You're good.
[36:27.650 --> 36:28.510]  You're down to 7.
[36:29.310 --> 36:29.830]  You're alright.
[36:32.750 --> 36:34.330]  Oh, it really ramps up.
[36:34.330 --> 36:36.110]  It really ramps up for that final 5.
[36:37.050 --> 36:37.990]  Yeah, you got cheese.
[36:38.030 --> 36:39.270]  The rat loves that.
[36:41.570 --> 36:42.450]  Swiss cheese.
[36:43.650 --> 36:45.670]  I heard that they're gonna make those out of trees.
[36:45.890 --> 36:47.470]  You hear about that Swiss cheese tree?
[36:48.450 --> 36:55.190]  I'm just saying that if you can get an ingredient, and you have a tree of that ingredient, I think potato's a crazy one.
[36:56.750 --> 36:58.290]  A carrot tree would be great.
[36:59.070 --> 37:01.570]  But again, you're going with stuff that already grows.
[37:01.570 --> 37:06.990]  I think the idea of the exercise is to find things that don't grow on trees or in shrubs or whatever, you know what I mean?
[37:08.510 --> 37:09.950]  Okay, what about...
[37:11.810 --> 37:12.810]  Let me think about this.
[37:12.990 --> 37:13.050]  Okay.
[37:13.150 --> 37:15.530]  What's a good... pepperoni tree?
[37:16.090 --> 37:18.210]  Oh, see, pepperoni tree? Pretty fucking good.
[37:18.450 --> 37:19.110]  Pepperoni tree.
[37:19.290 --> 37:23.930]  Now, would you do it, like, it would be like little slices, or would you be like...
[37:23.930 --> 37:27.650]  No, I want that big dong. I want that pepperoni dong.
[37:27.870 --> 37:30.390]  I'm with you. 100%. That'd be so fucking cool.
[37:31.810 --> 37:34.550]  Gotta make it to that broom, I guess, but...
[37:34.550 --> 37:35.210]  I guess, yes.
[37:35.710 --> 37:35.950]  Yep.
[37:36.410 --> 37:38.090]  Doesn't even matter. Maybe it's just a way down.
[37:38.250 --> 37:38.350]  Yeah.
[37:39.730 --> 37:40.770]  I'm gonna go on the broom.
[37:42.310 --> 37:42.970]  Get that coin.
[37:43.170 --> 37:43.430]  Boom.
[37:43.590 --> 37:44.690]  Or not. Okay, there we go.
[37:48.010 --> 37:48.950]  Where's this gonna put you?
[37:49.230 --> 37:49.810]  Oh, okay.
[37:49.890 --> 37:50.550]  I have no idea where this is going.
[37:50.550 --> 37:54.230]  Oh, okay, cool. Alright. Now, this is the way you were going with that guy earlier.
[37:54.410 --> 37:56.530]  Ah, the French guy. Yeah, I should probably go low, right?
[37:56.630 --> 37:58.630]  I would think so, because we weren't down here before.
[37:59.050 --> 37:59.870]  What is this?
[38:00.170 --> 38:00.830]  It's caramel.
[38:00.830 --> 38:02.210]  Oh, a rat door.
[38:02.890 --> 38:04.650]  A little rat door. I can't do anything.
[38:04.730 --> 38:05.810]  That's probably for a thing.
[38:06.150 --> 38:08.130]  I bet that's a thing later, where...
[38:08.130 --> 38:08.870]  Oh, it has to be.
[38:08.950 --> 38:13.290]  It's like, oh, in this mission, now you're gonna hide, or something.
[38:14.610 --> 38:15.970]  Oh, gotta pop the toast.
[38:16.010 --> 38:16.810]  Oh, absolutely.
[38:17.490 --> 38:19.910]  Good, you saved him. The toast is good now.
[38:21.630 --> 38:22.830]  What is the point of that?
[38:23.770 --> 38:27.930]  Again, I think it's for the next part, where it's like, oh, you gotta hide from the chef.
[38:28.670 --> 38:29.910]  And you have to distract him with shit.
[38:32.350 --> 38:34.090]  I just wanted to break that.
[38:34.250 --> 38:34.650]  I understand.
[38:34.870 --> 38:37.190]  Get some fucking glass in the caramel sauce.
[38:37.310 --> 38:38.210]  Yeah, yum.
[38:39.650 --> 38:40.710]  That's texture, you know?
[38:41.470 --> 38:45.090]  Okay, but what if the rat soup was rat and glass shard soup?
[38:45.230 --> 38:45.950]  What about then?
[38:46.090 --> 38:47.070]  I think I would skip it.
[38:47.930 --> 38:48.370]  Oh, man.
[38:48.450 --> 38:48.610]  Yeah.
[38:49.190 --> 38:49.990]  Tough, tough.
[38:50.070 --> 38:50.590]  It's tough.
[38:51.010 --> 38:52.190]  You know, what's in a name, right?
[38:53.610 --> 38:54.410]  Is that a cake?
[38:54.730 --> 38:55.050]  It has...
[38:55.630 --> 38:56.210]  What is...
[38:56.210 --> 38:56.810]  Did it hurt you?
[38:56.810 --> 38:57.550]  Did you just get lit on fire?
[38:58.350 --> 38:59.630]  No, it's like an icing gun.
[39:00.110 --> 39:00.430]  Oh.
[39:00.890 --> 39:01.750]  Oh, it is, yeah.
[39:03.030 --> 39:03.350]  Weird.
[39:03.770 --> 39:04.330]  Yeah, okay.
[39:04.650 --> 39:05.770]  I don't think there's anything up here.
[39:06.490 --> 39:08.310]  How do I get higher, is the question.
[39:11.210 --> 39:12.530]  Can I get on your hat?
[39:14.830 --> 39:16.090]  They will not allow that.
[39:16.230 --> 39:16.490]  Nope.
[39:19.070 --> 39:20.830]  Let's just do a quick sprint, and then...
[39:20.830 --> 39:22.550]  I don't feel like we've done back left.
[39:22.870 --> 39:23.110]  No.
[39:23.410 --> 39:24.390]  I feel like we've explored...
[39:24.390 --> 39:25.450]  Oh, here's another rat door.
[39:25.450 --> 39:26.110]  There you go, there you go.
[39:26.250 --> 39:27.750]  So, I bet that's just a thing for the...
[39:27.750 --> 39:28.530]  Oh, there you go, there's a coin.
[39:29.590 --> 39:30.650]  Right, no, no, back.
[39:30.930 --> 39:31.290]  Over here, right?
[39:31.370 --> 39:32.630]  Yep, and then through there.
[39:33.050 --> 39:33.870]  Is that not a coin?
[39:34.050 --> 39:34.910]  No, this is the ball.
[39:34.910 --> 39:35.810]  I got tricked by a ball.
[39:35.830 --> 39:37.070]  Got tricked by the ball.
[39:37.070 --> 39:39.050]  Dude, I got fucking rat tricked by the ball.
[39:39.290 --> 39:39.630]  Fuck.
[39:43.330 --> 39:44.970]  Have you ever been rat tricked before?
[39:45.070 --> 39:47.670]  I don't, you know, I hadn't, and now I know how it feels.
[39:47.710 --> 39:48.170]  It feels bad.
[39:48.370 --> 39:49.630]  I'm glad we documented it.
[39:49.630 --> 39:49.830]  Yeah.
[39:50.150 --> 39:51.290]  I got fucking rat tricked.
[39:51.730 --> 39:52.290]  It's fucked up.
[39:52.350 --> 39:53.010]  What about this?
[39:53.850 --> 39:54.290]  There you go.
[39:54.290 --> 39:56.710]  This, as you said, all feels like mission stuff.
[39:56.750 --> 39:57.030]  Right, yeah.
[39:57.030 --> 39:58.470]  That's just in the level currently.
[39:58.470 --> 39:59.950]  I like the way this fire looks.
[40:03.550 --> 40:07.330]  Now, water is often a thing discussed as being like a tough thing to get right.
[40:08.070 --> 40:11.630]  I don't, I don't think I've ever seen fire look that way.
[40:11.670 --> 40:12.010]  Me neither.
[40:13.410 --> 40:17.750]  The sound isn't terrible, but it looks like ghost fire.
[40:17.830 --> 40:18.910]  I think it looks like Goku hair.
[40:19.070 --> 40:19.470]  Supernatural.
[40:19.630 --> 40:20.990]  I think it looks like hair that Goku would have.
[40:22.410 --> 40:24.410]  It looks like the bottom of those squids.
[40:24.830 --> 40:25.570]  It does.
[40:25.890 --> 40:26.850]  That's pretty good, that's a good pull.
[40:30.330 --> 40:32.110]  Yeah, this is, wait, what was that noise?
[40:33.290 --> 40:34.710]  Some of the sound design in this game.
[40:34.910 --> 40:36.430]  Yeah, I think there's just like, noises.
[40:38.530 --> 40:38.930]  Okay.
[40:40.530 --> 40:41.570]  Let's go back left.
[40:41.730 --> 40:42.010]  Yeah.
[40:43.250 --> 40:46.590]  Let's see how many coins we can get.
[40:48.890 --> 40:50.430]  And then just tackle these minigames.
[40:50.830 --> 40:54.090]  Do you think if we had a, if I had a mozzarella tree and you had the pepperoni tree,
[40:54.190 --> 41:00.210]  you think we could talk, like, Gavin or Geoff into doing, like, dough tree?
[41:00.570 --> 41:01.370]  And then we can do, like,
[41:01.450 --> 41:01.990]  Oh, absolutely.
[41:02.170 --> 41:03.570]  Like, we almost got, like, a pizza thing going?
[41:04.950 --> 41:07.330]  Gavin would be no, because he's got, like, the wet bread thing.
[41:07.330 --> 41:08.030]  Right, right, right.
[41:08.230 --> 41:11.350]  I feel like a dough tree is a bad mix with that.
[41:11.410 --> 41:13.130]  No, you're definitely, you're smart for that one.
[41:13.670 --> 41:13.990]  100%.
[41:14.570 --> 41:16.290]  Geoff, I think, would love a dough tree.
[41:16.510 --> 41:17.570]  Oh, he would do so much with it.
[41:17.830 --> 41:19.470]  He would have so many ideas right off the bat.
[41:20.430 --> 41:21.510]  Like, off the rip, he's like,
[41:21.550 --> 41:24.510]  I can make sandwiches, and I can make strombolis, and I can make calzones.
[41:24.630 --> 41:25.250]  And it's like, yeah, okay.
[41:25.490 --> 41:27.170]  We're just trying to focus on pizza, baby.
[41:32.230 --> 41:33.610]  I don't think we've been over here.
[41:33.610 --> 41:35.230]  No, I don't think so. This does not look familiar.
[41:38.430 --> 41:39.870]  I just want to blow up this fire extinguisher.
[41:39.910 --> 41:40.630]  Yeah, I hear that.
[41:42.230 --> 41:44.090]  Do you ever let loose on a fire extinguisher?
[41:44.250 --> 41:45.550]  Uh, yeah, like, once or twice.
[41:46.690 --> 41:47.250]  Pretty cool.
[41:49.210 --> 41:50.170]  What were the contacts?
[41:50.170 --> 41:54.190]  Uh, you know, you break into, like, an abandoned Kmart, and there's some stuff left around.
[41:56.550 --> 41:58.770]  That is exactly the answer I was hoping for.
[41:58.770 --> 42:00.010]  Yeah, you know, it's a thing where it's like,
[42:00.050 --> 42:02.630]  you ever, like, smash any light tubes?
[42:02.710 --> 42:04.790]  And it's like, yeah, absolutely, a lot of times.
[42:05.870 --> 42:06.230]  100%.
[42:08.030 --> 42:10.950]  I think you have to go to get...
[42:12.150 --> 42:12.510]  No...
[42:12.510 --> 42:16.350]  I was going to say for, uh, it was the way that, like, you floated down,
[42:16.450 --> 42:17.470]  but I don't think that was it.
[42:19.330 --> 42:19.990]  There's a coin.
[42:21.850 --> 42:23.130]  Oh, yeah, on that flower.
[42:23.350 --> 42:23.790]  Good eye.
[42:24.610 --> 42:25.410]  Right there.
[42:27.090 --> 42:28.090]  Oh my god, what?
[42:28.710 --> 42:29.530]  Okay, they stomp.
[42:30.090 --> 42:31.670]  I was trying to see what he was doing.
[42:31.870 --> 42:32.050]  Right.
[42:32.450 --> 42:34.390]  Let's just look at that animation, let's just run back.
[42:34.550 --> 42:35.470]  Let's see what this man...
[42:39.150 --> 42:41.270]  Chance to work in a real kitchen?
[42:42.790 --> 42:43.950]  Oh, 70? Okay.
[42:44.290 --> 42:47.290]  Oh, man, he's got that Iron Sheik walk.
[42:48.510 --> 42:49.590]  Oh, no.
[42:52.050 --> 42:53.310]  I'll just go this way.
[42:54.670 --> 42:55.490]  What will I do?
[42:57.490 --> 42:59.130]  Let's navigate through here.
[43:03.080 --> 43:05.720]  Okay, let's go to the back right.
[43:08.220 --> 43:10.840]  I wonder how many people have gotten every achievement in this game.
[43:10.840 --> 43:12.040]  Uh, that's a great question.
[43:13.360 --> 43:16.540]  Probably quite a few, because I feel like this came out, like, the prime.
[43:17.260 --> 43:19.000]  The gamer score needs to be higher.
[43:19.480 --> 43:20.360]  Gamer score, achievement hunter, yeah.
[43:20.380 --> 43:21.240]  Gotta get those achievements.
[43:22.800 --> 43:23.520]  Big time.
[43:25.880 --> 43:27.060]  This looks kind of interesting.
[43:28.160 --> 43:28.980]  Have we been over here?
[43:29.400 --> 43:29.960]  Oh, coins.
[43:30.220 --> 43:30.720]  No, we haven't.
[43:30.820 --> 43:31.300]  We have not.
[43:34.220 --> 43:37.300]  I'm hoping for one more thing a bonus got me before.
[43:37.460 --> 43:40.480]  Yeah, we're at more than half of the coins, though.
[43:41.280 --> 43:42.120]  Yeah, we're doing good.
[43:42.900 --> 43:45.300]  I think this level is going to take us a lot less time.
[43:45.580 --> 43:47.800]  I think this is at most a video level.
[43:50.760 --> 43:51.960]  Let's launch again.
[43:54.480 --> 43:55.840]  We went through there, but let's...
[43:57.880 --> 43:58.880]  Man, that guy.
[43:59.300 --> 44:00.380]  What a fucked up head.
[44:00.580 --> 44:02.020]  I mean, that's you, right?
[44:02.160 --> 44:03.280]  You're just looking in the mirror.
[44:03.480 --> 44:04.360]  That is me.
[44:06.600 --> 44:07.740]  I wonder why.
[44:08.500 --> 44:09.720]  What was the design choice?
[44:09.720 --> 44:11.240]  Is that guy in the movie, I wonder?
[44:11.520 --> 44:12.220]  Did they have to?
[44:12.260 --> 44:12.800]  I bet he is.
[44:12.860 --> 44:14.460]  I bet he's in the movie and they just went...
[44:14.460 --> 44:15.200]  I mean, it's close enough.
[44:15.280 --> 44:16.540]  Just, you know, put him in this thing.
[44:17.340 --> 44:17.620]  Yeah.
[44:17.800 --> 44:20.300]  He looks like a character that has one or two lines in the movie.
[44:21.320 --> 44:21.800]  He does.
[44:23.140 --> 44:24.060]  Let's get on the ball.
[44:24.180 --> 44:25.200]  Let's just spin around.
[44:25.420 --> 44:25.600]  Okay.
[44:28.220 --> 44:28.860]  And then...
[44:29.480 --> 44:31.280]  Maybe do a story mission, I guess?
[44:31.500 --> 44:33.380]  Yeah, I think we gotta do a story mission.
[44:33.600 --> 44:34.160]  Or we do...
[44:34.160 --> 44:34.480]  Wrap it up?
[44:34.760 --> 44:35.160]  No, no, no.
[44:35.820 --> 44:36.460]  Come on.
[44:38.200 --> 44:39.600]  I think we gotta do a story mission.
[44:39.600 --> 44:42.780]  I think we gotta do a couple of the minigames, man.
[44:43.600 --> 44:44.700]  So we've done that.
[44:45.020 --> 44:46.540]  We've done the timed thing.
[44:47.720 --> 44:48.820]  There's one of those books.
[44:49.020 --> 44:49.600]  Let's see...
[44:50.780 --> 44:51.720]  Let's do this.
[44:52.120 --> 44:53.480]  This is the springboard one, right?
[44:53.560 --> 44:53.720]  Yeah.
[44:53.920 --> 44:54.100]  Cool.
[44:54.500 --> 44:56.240]  Let's get rid of the watches.
[44:56.520 --> 44:57.340]  Yeah, I'm with that.
[44:57.400 --> 44:57.640]  Wow.
[44:57.940 --> 44:58.180]  Okay.
[44:59.640 --> 45:00.460]  Jesus Christ.
[45:00.600 --> 45:01.140]  You really...
[45:01.140 --> 45:02.000]  You fly in this.
[45:02.040 --> 45:02.320]  Wow.
[45:03.120 --> 45:05.640]  Okay, this is pretty fun.
[45:05.920 --> 45:06.720]  This is pretty good.
[45:06.920 --> 45:07.980]  Damn, this is cool.
[45:10.180 --> 45:10.620]  Wow.
[45:10.900 --> 45:11.120]  Hell yeah.
[45:11.280 --> 45:12.040]  And you got ten charms.
[45:12.140 --> 45:12.760]  Little Chef Big Kitchen.
[45:12.980 --> 45:13.200]  Yep.
[45:14.180 --> 45:15.000]  And you got ten charms, baby.
[45:15.000 --> 45:16.400]  Little Chef...
[45:16.400 --> 45:17.240]  You're at 66?
[45:17.560 --> 45:20.240]  And you know that there's a bunch all the way at the very tippy-tippy top.
[45:21.180 --> 45:21.600]  Yep.
[45:23.640 --> 45:24.080]  Okay.
[45:25.100 --> 45:25.920]  Blocks are done.
[45:26.780 --> 45:27.960]  Let's do a story thing.
[45:29.760 --> 45:30.480]  Let's do it.
[45:32.360 --> 45:33.300]  Walk this way.
[45:33.360 --> 45:34.620]  Walk this way!
[45:34.960 --> 45:35.880]  That should be in this.
[45:37.960 --> 45:38.940]  How do you talk?
[45:38.940 --> 45:39.960]  Which way should you talk?
[45:40.340 --> 45:41.220]  This way.
[45:41.400 --> 45:42.360]  Just give me a kiss.
[45:42.460 --> 45:43.100]  Okay.
[45:47.660 --> 45:50.360]  That sounded so much like a soundboard.
[45:50.920 --> 45:51.880]  That was perfect.
[45:52.300 --> 45:55.080]  That came in so cleanly and ended perfectly.
[45:55.660 --> 45:56.540]  Oh my God.
[45:57.440 --> 46:01.160]  Oh, I don't even care.
[46:01.500 --> 46:01.880]  He's Ratatouille.
[46:01.880 --> 46:02.080]  Whatever.
[46:02.400 --> 46:02.940]  He's Ratatouille.
[46:03.060 --> 46:04.600]  Gameplays are fucking weird.
[46:06.720 --> 46:08.580]  This is like just for us.
[46:08.580 --> 46:09.300]  This is so funny.
[46:09.440 --> 46:10.760]  It is so for us.
[46:10.980 --> 46:15.340]  We're gonna have nine parts of these and nobody's gonna want any of them.
[46:15.340 --> 46:15.940]  And that's okay.
[46:16.140 --> 46:16.720]  Yeah, that's fine.
[46:16.800 --> 46:17.480]  I hope they do.
[46:17.800 --> 46:18.720]  I hope so also.
[46:19.420 --> 46:23.140]  As an Achievement Hunter, me and Andrew are the Achievement Hunters at Regulation Podcast.
[46:24.480 --> 46:27.200]  You know, we just wanted to see what the fuck's up.
[46:27.600 --> 46:28.740]  I don't think it's that way.
[46:29.020 --> 46:30.340]  I think you're in a race, dude.
[46:30.420 --> 46:31.280]  I don't think you gotta do that.
[46:31.320 --> 46:31.840]  It's a clam.
[46:33.120 --> 46:34.160]  I think you're in a race.
[46:34.180 --> 46:35.060]  What do you mean, I'm racing?
[46:35.460 --> 46:36.020]  Are you not?
[46:36.020 --> 46:39.480]  Okay, it says go by, it goes like past the cleaner, right?
[46:39.640 --> 46:40.320]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[46:40.440 --> 46:41.240]  Right bumper, right bumper.
[46:41.420 --> 46:41.940]  There you go.
[46:46.050 --> 46:48.370]  Okay, destroy the swarms in the freezer.
[46:49.230 --> 46:50.330]  So let's find the freezer.
[46:51.250 --> 46:51.770]  The swarms?
[46:51.790 --> 46:52.530]  Are we in the freezer?
[46:53.870 --> 46:54.670]  What's swarms?
[46:55.810 --> 46:56.590]  I don't know.
[46:57.250 --> 46:58.690]  I don't like that those just respawn.
[46:58.690 --> 47:03.670]  I think you gotta go back to where the cleaning stuff was and then it's gonna be over there.
[47:04.610 --> 47:07.170]  Because I think you're back at the beginning and this isn't where you're supposed to be.
[47:08.150 --> 47:09.670]  Okay, so I'm gonna go this way.
[47:09.890 --> 47:10.230]  Uh-oh.
[47:10.370 --> 47:10.850]  Fuck me.
[47:10.850 --> 47:11.290]  You're fine, you're fine.
[47:11.330 --> 47:11.710]  Hit the button.
[47:11.930 --> 47:12.190]  You're good.
[47:12.730 --> 47:13.370]  Yeah, okay.
[47:16.110 --> 47:17.010]  So you guide me.
[47:17.070 --> 47:17.590]  Where do you want me to go?
[47:17.610 --> 47:23.250]  I think you keep going this way and then you're gonna go left and around and then to the left back there.
[47:23.290 --> 47:25.890]  You gotta go back there and then hang a right.
[47:27.390 --> 47:28.210]  Can't go this way?
[47:28.670 --> 47:28.930]  Wait, wait.
[47:29.010 --> 47:30.090]  Can you jump down and hit your...
[47:30.090 --> 47:30.570]  Can't tell what.
[47:31.610 --> 47:31.930]  Nope.
[47:32.750 --> 47:33.450]  Can't break them.
[47:35.030 --> 47:35.890]  What does he mean break them?
[47:35.890 --> 47:36.550]  I just loop around.
[47:36.550 --> 47:37.710]  What does the swarms mean?
[47:37.790 --> 47:38.470]  What does that mean?
[47:39.630 --> 47:40.490]  Maybe these?
[47:41.530 --> 47:42.590]  I don't think so.
[47:44.010 --> 47:44.570]  Oh, wait.
[47:44.590 --> 47:45.330]  I can climb this.
[47:45.710 --> 47:45.890]  Oh.
[47:46.470 --> 47:47.090]  There we go.
[47:47.250 --> 47:47.970]  Oh, good eye.
[47:49.870 --> 47:50.310]  Whew.
[47:50.570 --> 47:51.010]  There you go.
[47:51.510 --> 47:51.950]  Oh!
[47:52.710 --> 47:53.410]  Give me that coin.
[47:54.350 --> 47:54.690]  Crab!
[47:54.990 --> 47:56.170]  Fuck outta here, crab.
[47:56.270 --> 47:57.530]  Get the fuck away from me.
[47:58.710 --> 47:59.950]  We gotta be on the right path.
[48:00.210 --> 48:00.650]  Ooh, electrified.
[48:01.950 --> 48:02.390]  Health.
[48:02.650 --> 48:02.870]  Okay.
[48:04.850 --> 48:06.730]  I like the crab cake coming here.
[48:06.870 --> 48:08.130]  You're a fucking trap, bitch.
[48:08.310 --> 48:08.710]  Motherfucker.
[48:10.730 --> 48:13.670]  Yeah, you gotta take the middle and then go to the... hang on.
[48:14.090 --> 48:14.670]  Now go right.
[48:15.590 --> 48:16.210]  There you go.
[48:16.290 --> 48:17.310]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[48:18.290 --> 48:18.690]  Okay.
[48:19.290 --> 48:19.970]  And then tail whip.
[48:20.330 --> 48:20.390]  Fuck.
[48:20.390 --> 48:21.350]  Drop that down.
[48:21.650 --> 48:22.150]  Keep going.
[48:22.370 --> 48:22.570]  Cross.
[48:22.690 --> 48:26.830]  I feel like these clams are just like the dude with the bottles at the end of the Warriors.
[48:27.210 --> 48:27.450]  Oh.
[48:27.470 --> 48:27.970]  Oh, yeah.
[48:28.110 --> 48:28.950]  It's the same feel to me.
[48:29.590 --> 48:30.270]  Hit... wait, wait.
[48:30.350 --> 48:31.750]  Go back and hit right bumper.
[48:33.350 --> 48:33.670]  Okay.
[48:35.930 --> 48:36.250]  Right...
[48:36.490 --> 48:36.670]  Here.
[48:36.810 --> 48:37.390]  Oh, here we go.
[48:38.950 --> 48:39.690]  Oh, okay.
[48:39.870 --> 48:40.170]  Thanks.
[48:40.170 --> 48:40.610]  Oh, okay, cool.
[48:41.250 --> 48:45.030]  Yeah, the guy with the Coke bottles thing, like, I think that really, like...
[48:45.030 --> 48:47.930]  I think the Warriors is, like, a big-time, like, dad movie.
[48:48.730 --> 48:50.810]  And I think it's for, like, that reason, you know?
[48:51.050 --> 48:51.750]  I think, uh...
[48:52.570 --> 48:55.690]  I think that guy, like, really sold it as, like, this is, like, a cool movie.
[48:56.690 --> 48:57.170]  I love the Warriors.
[48:57.170 --> 48:57.870]  You don't like the Warriors?
[48:57.890 --> 48:58.590]  No, I love the Warriors.
[48:58.590 --> 48:58.910]  Okay.
[48:59.170 --> 48:59.830]  I love it.
[48:59.830 --> 49:00.270]  Great.
[49:00.510 --> 49:01.350]  Fuck me.
[49:01.370 --> 49:02.230]  Oh, you gotta climb again.
[49:02.570 --> 49:03.390]  But here's the thing.
[49:04.070 --> 49:09.450]  There's an issue with the Warriors where there's a director's cut, and that's, like, the only way...
[49:09.450 --> 49:12.450]  For, like, a long time, it was, like, the only version of the DVD you could get.
[49:13.090 --> 49:13.510]  Yeah.
[49:13.510 --> 49:15.430]  It was, like, the shitty fucking director's cut.
[49:15.670 --> 49:16.870]  With, like, the comics stuff.
[49:18.290 --> 49:19.130]  And, um...
[49:19.660 --> 49:23.010]  I think they've re-released it since without that stuff.
[49:23.390 --> 49:24.230]  So you can, uh...
[49:24.430 --> 49:25.390]  What are you doing?
[49:25.570 --> 49:26.470]  Go jump right.
[49:26.610 --> 49:27.270]  I'm trying to...
[49:27.270 --> 49:27.590]  There you go.
[49:27.590 --> 49:28.270]  Yeah, I'm trying.
[49:28.850 --> 49:29.210]  Um...
[49:29.210 --> 49:33.690]  So, you can, like, get the regular version of the Warriors now that is very good.
[49:34.770 --> 49:35.130]  Um...
[49:35.130 --> 49:35.830]  I love the Warriors.
[49:35.890 --> 49:37.210]  I think I've only seen the direct...
[49:37.210 --> 49:39.630]  Outside of the comic stuff, is there anything different?
[49:39.730 --> 49:46.010]  Uh, the transitions, like, there are, like, no transitions in stuff like that movie where it's, like, you know, like, the pages change and everything.
[49:46.130 --> 49:47.250]  It's just, like, the scenes change.
[49:47.350 --> 49:48.290]  And I think they probably add...
[49:48.290 --> 49:48.510]  Sure.
[49:48.550 --> 49:50.510]  There's probably one or two things that are added back.
[49:51.110 --> 49:51.470]  Um...
[49:51.470 --> 49:53.370]  But, like, I don't think any of it's necessary.
[49:54.150 --> 49:54.510]  Uh...
[49:54.510 --> 49:57.250]  I think the movie is pretty complete as it is.
[49:57.810 --> 49:58.170]  So...
[49:58.170 --> 49:59.490]  What? Oh, okay.
[50:00.290 --> 50:00.650]  Uh...
[50:00.650 --> 50:01.450]  What are you supposed to do?
[50:02.430 --> 50:03.050]  I don't know.
[50:03.250 --> 50:04.530]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[50:06.030 --> 50:07.190]  I don't know what that...
[50:07.190 --> 50:07.870]  What is that?
[50:08.310 --> 50:09.130]  Okay, whatever.
[50:09.270 --> 50:09.890]  I don't...
[50:09.890 --> 50:10.390]  I mean, you're fine.
[50:11.110 --> 50:11.810]  I'm gonna go back.
[50:12.010 --> 50:12.270]  Okay.
[50:13.670 --> 50:14.410]  What is it?
[50:14.630 --> 50:15.630]  Oh, is it bug spray?
[50:15.630 --> 50:17.010]  It's such a weird...
[50:17.010 --> 50:19.690]  I think so, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with it.
[50:23.640 --> 50:25.000]  I think we had this before...
[50:25.560 --> 50:26.160]  Fuck me.
[50:26.500 --> 50:27.400]  I don't think you need it.
[50:27.480 --> 50:28.200]  I think you just gotta keep going.
[50:28.200 --> 50:29.000]  Oh, I got one health.
[50:29.000 --> 50:29.520]  Oh, shit.
[50:30.380 --> 50:31.400]  I think you just gotta keep going, dude.
[50:32.400 --> 50:32.620]  Yeah.
[50:35.180 --> 50:35.980]  You gotta...
[50:35.980 --> 50:36.960]  Yeah, fling back.
[50:38.000 --> 50:38.280]  Oh.
[50:38.780 --> 50:43.020]  Uh, I think you have to put the bug spray there, and then it keeps the bugs away from you when
[50:43.020 --> 50:43.760]  you get flung back.
[50:44.580 --> 50:45.300]  Does that make sense?
[50:46.520 --> 50:47.020]  Yeah, it does.
[50:47.140 --> 50:47.280]  Yeah.
[50:48.300 --> 50:49.800]  I think that's what you have to do.
[50:53.190 --> 50:55.110]  Did you ever play the Warriors game on Xbox?
[50:56.710 --> 50:57.670]  Oh, did I?
[50:57.750 --> 50:58.570]  Yeah, it's fucking...
[50:58.570 --> 50:59.270]  It's so fun.
[50:59.270 --> 50:59.850]  It's a great game.
[50:59.910 --> 51:00.610]  Yeah, it's really fun.
[51:00.850 --> 51:01.610]  It's a rockstar game.
[51:01.670 --> 51:01.950]  It's great.
[51:02.150 --> 51:02.850]  See, I think you gotta...
[51:02.850 --> 51:03.010]  Whoops.
[51:03.110 --> 51:04.490]  Yeah, you gotta take the bug spray with you.
[51:05.830 --> 51:06.350]  And then I think...
[51:06.350 --> 51:08.730]  Are there multiple Warriors games as well?
[51:09.490 --> 51:09.790]  What were the...
[51:09.790 --> 51:13.190]  I got a Warriors game I don't think you've ever played on this Xbox.
[51:13.210 --> 51:13.390]  Really?
[51:13.570 --> 51:14.530]  Oh, why'd you tail whip it?
[51:14.550 --> 51:14.770]  Whatever.
[51:15.170 --> 51:15.590]  It doesn't matter.
[51:15.630 --> 51:15.950]  You can go.
[51:16.090 --> 51:16.310]  Really?
[51:16.970 --> 51:17.290]  See?
[51:17.330 --> 51:17.570]  No!
[51:18.070 --> 51:18.510]  You have to go back and get it.
[51:18.570 --> 51:19.550]  You have to go back and get it.
[51:19.570 --> 51:20.670]  I don't know why you tail whipped it.
[51:21.830 --> 51:23.190]  I misunderstood the assignment.
[51:23.870 --> 51:26.070]  You just leave it there, and it keeps them away from you.
[51:26.330 --> 51:27.510]  Yeah, it repels them.
[51:27.510 --> 51:28.490]  That's why there's a circle.
[51:28.670 --> 51:28.810]  Right there.
[51:29.450 --> 51:30.110]  I get it.
[51:30.150 --> 51:30.390]  That's it.
[51:30.510 --> 51:30.930]  Yeah, I'm putting it down.
[51:32.190 --> 51:33.190]  And then we launch.
[51:34.610 --> 51:34.930]  Whoa.
[51:38.610 --> 51:39.810]  Yeah, that guy has a weird career.
[51:39.970 --> 51:41.850]  I know him from Commando and the Warriors.
[51:42.030 --> 51:42.490]  And I don't think...
[51:42.490 --> 51:45.330]  I can't think of another movie the bottle guy was in.
[51:45.830 --> 51:49.530]  He has the best part in Commando, though, where he's like,
[51:49.570 --> 51:51.090]  Remember you said you'd kill me last?
[51:51.170 --> 51:52.470]  And he's like, Yeah, I said you'd kill me last.
[51:52.750 --> 51:53.750]  I lied.
[51:53.850 --> 51:55.210]  And then he fucking drops him.
[51:55.250 --> 51:55.690]  It's so cool.
[51:56.710 --> 52:01.150]  Did you know that the female lead in Commando is Tommy Chong's daughter?
[52:01.510 --> 52:01.830]  Really?
[52:02.970 --> 52:03.390]  Yeah.
[52:03.490 --> 52:04.370]  Oh, that's crazy.
[52:04.770 --> 52:05.070]  That's Tommy Chong's daughter.
[52:05.410 --> 52:07.750]  And she's the person who discovered Chris Pratt.
[52:08.230 --> 52:09.230]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[52:09.310 --> 52:09.970]  That's crazy.
[52:10.370 --> 52:10.510]  Yeah.
[52:10.670 --> 52:11.570]  That's nuts.
[52:12.770 --> 52:16.830]  He was like, I want to say a server at Bubba Gump Shrimps, I think.
[52:17.030 --> 52:17.210]  Yeah.
[52:17.310 --> 52:19.670]  And she went in there, and he recognized her.
[52:19.750 --> 52:22.330]  And so she put him in some indie movie thing.
[52:22.550 --> 52:23.090]  Oh, crazy.
[52:23.250 --> 52:23.430]  She's doing.
[52:24.210 --> 52:24.870]  That's nuts.
[52:24.870 --> 52:26.690]  What are we supposed to do with this ball?
[52:27.090 --> 52:33.430]  The guy who played Ajax in The Warriors, his name is, I think, James Raymar.
[52:33.750 --> 52:35.690]  He's in so much, like, what a character actor.
[52:35.690 --> 52:37.410]  That guy has such a fucking great career.
[52:38.430 --> 52:39.210]  Best part of Dexter.
[52:39.430 --> 52:45.990]  Yeah, and I don't think people probably give him the credit that he deserves for what kind of career that he's had.
[52:46.050 --> 52:47.530]  Because he's been in everything.
[52:48.170 --> 52:51.090]  He was in, like, Sex and the City.
[52:51.350 --> 52:52.910]  Dude's in, like, so much stuff.
[52:53.130 --> 52:54.030]  It's so fucking wild.
[52:54.030 --> 52:54.770]  I have no idea.
[52:55.070 --> 52:56.610]  He's in, like, so much stuff.
[52:57.030 --> 52:57.490]  It rocks.
[53:00.470 --> 53:02.150]  So you beat that level.
[53:02.530 --> 53:04.410]  Do you feel good about the mission that you just beat?
[53:05.630 --> 53:05.950]  I do.
[53:06.250 --> 53:07.490]  I'm glad that we knocked it out.
[53:07.650 --> 53:08.470]  We got some coins.
[53:08.570 --> 53:09.170]  We're at 70.
[53:09.310 --> 53:11.330]  Like, I think we're making great progress.
[53:11.670 --> 53:11.830]  Definitely.
[53:13.370 --> 53:14.230]  Oh, wait, wait, was that a coin?
[53:14.450 --> 53:16.310]  No, I think I got tricked by the ball again, Andrew.
[53:16.390 --> 53:17.170]  No, it's the beach ball again.
[53:17.170 --> 53:19.630]  I think I got tricked by the, Andrew, I think I got tricked by the ball again.
[53:20.070 --> 53:21.250]  It's gonna get you so many times.
[53:21.250 --> 53:22.770]  I think I got rat tricked again.
[53:22.770 --> 53:23.850]  Oh, no.
[53:25.370 --> 53:30.990]  What hap- is it the guy with an afro in that movie that died because he got into a fight with the director?
[53:31.350 --> 53:32.170]  Yeah, I think so.
[53:32.570 --> 53:34.350]  Yeah, the guy who plays, I think, Cochise?
[53:34.550 --> 53:35.170]  When he was in the thing?
[53:36.010 --> 53:36.230]  Yeah.
[53:38.290 --> 53:38.850]  Isn't that crazy?
[53:40.110 --> 53:41.190]  What are you supposed to do?
[53:42.490 --> 53:44.950]  There's a thief in the dishwasher room. He may be protecting something.
[53:45.070 --> 53:45.350]  Okay.
[53:45.950 --> 53:46.890]  We will kill him.
[53:46.990 --> 53:47.770]  Let's, uh...
[53:48.310 --> 53:49.830]  Yeah, let's blow some shit up.
[53:49.830 --> 53:50.990]  Yeah, we will destroy-
[53:50.990 --> 53:51.290]  First of all.
[53:51.330 --> 53:53.130]  We will fucking destroy him.
[53:53.630 --> 53:54.490]  What the fuck?!
[53:54.490 --> 53:54.830]  What the fuck?!
[53:55.990 --> 53:57.290]  What the fuck?!
[53:57.290 --> 53:58.630]  Oh, give me- give me the pepper back.
[53:59.170 --> 53:59.490]  What?!
[53:59.490 --> 54:00.110]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[54:02.890 --> 54:03.750]  No, no, no, no, no.
[54:03.890 --> 54:04.770]  Get away, get away, get away.
[54:05.770 --> 54:06.850]  Hit- hit right bumper.
[54:07.070 --> 54:07.470]  Oh, no.
[54:09.530 --> 54:11.110]  He's trying to blow the valve off the pipe.
[54:11.170 --> 54:11.610]  Okay, so hit it.
[54:11.630 --> 54:14.650]  Oh, this is- we're causing some fucking damage to this kitchen.
[54:17.130 --> 54:17.770]  Yeah, nice!
[54:17.790 --> 54:18.610]  Oh, just spins it.
[54:19.090 --> 54:19.410]  Oh.
[54:19.930 --> 54:20.250]  Okay.
[54:21.310 --> 54:22.030]  And now you have the valve.
[54:22.230 --> 54:23.330]  We gotta get three valves.
[54:23.550 --> 54:23.810]  Okay.
[54:24.790 --> 54:26.870]  Watch out for the frog again for some reason.
[54:28.210 --> 54:29.490]  The fuck did the frog come from?
[54:29.490 --> 54:30.310]  Yeah, I don't-
[54:31.690 --> 54:33.790]  Well, it's a French thing, right? French people eat frogs.
[54:34.590 --> 54:36.950]  I- yeah, I mean, that's the thing, I guess.
[54:36.950 --> 54:38.310]  Isn't that a French delicacy thing?
[54:38.510 --> 54:38.710]  Yeah.
[54:38.850 --> 54:40.870]  I think you already- I don't think you need to come this way.
[54:40.950 --> 54:41.930]  Oh, you're gonna kill the frog?
[54:41.930 --> 54:42.590]  I just wanna blow him up.
[54:42.650 --> 54:42.730]  Yeah.
[54:43.110 --> 54:43.890]  Good achievement, you know?
[54:44.270 --> 54:44.610]  Look out!
[54:45.270 --> 54:45.590]  Possibly.
[54:46.990 --> 54:47.310]  Nice!
[54:47.310 --> 54:48.150]  Hell yeah!
[54:48.150 --> 54:48.850]  Get that frog.
[54:50.150 --> 54:50.370]  Alright.
[54:50.790 --> 54:53.810]  Remy killed a lot of things just behind the scenes, you didn't know it.
[54:53.870 --> 54:54.430]  Straight up murder.
[54:54.430 --> 54:55.090]  As if you were in the film.
[54:55.230 --> 54:56.230]  Murder, bitch.
[54:56.590 --> 54:57.690]  Uh, okay.
[54:57.890 --> 54:58.470]  Now where do we go?
[55:00.350 --> 55:01.490]  Nothing over here.
[55:03.610 --> 55:04.030]  Ooh!
[55:05.190 --> 55:06.030]  We skatin'.
[55:06.030 --> 55:06.630]  Ah, fuck.
[55:08.170 --> 55:10.170]  What does, uh- I had a right bumper-
[55:10.170 --> 55:10.930]  Right here, I want it.
[55:11.090 --> 55:11.610]  What's this?
[55:12.630 --> 55:12.910]  What?
[55:14.370 --> 55:15.830]  Tell me- just tell me-
[55:15.830 --> 55:16.830]  Just tell me-
[55:17.770 --> 55:18.570]  What's happening?
[55:19.690 --> 55:21.950]  The spill coming from the bathroom must mean there is a valve in there.
[55:22.030 --> 55:22.710]  Oh, okay.
[55:23.170 --> 55:24.270]  Is that what it must mean?
[55:24.290 --> 55:25.530]  Okay, so I gotta go in there.
[55:25.650 --> 55:26.470]  Yeah, do we need a pepper?
[55:27.310 --> 55:27.730]  We do.
[55:27.770 --> 55:29.290]  Oh, I didn't even notice that was available.
[55:30.450 --> 55:33.510]  Most humans think a good rat is a dead rat.
[55:33.910 --> 55:34.890]  They do think that, yeah.
[55:35.510 --> 55:37.810]  I would say generally, yeah, if you pulled people.
[55:37.990 --> 55:38.190]  Yeah.
[55:39.390 --> 55:40.510]  Not a lot of rat fans.
[55:40.530 --> 55:40.750]  No.
[55:43.110 --> 55:44.170]  Oh, fuck.
[55:44.170 --> 55:45.630]  Oh my god.
[55:46.210 --> 55:46.650]  Wow!
[55:47.510 --> 55:49.770]  That's an active gamer if I've ever seen one.
[55:49.870 --> 55:50.170]  Mm-hmm.
[55:50.610 --> 55:51.050]  Damn.
[55:53.190 --> 55:54.190]  Oh, oh, oh!
[55:56.470 --> 55:56.910]  Okay.
[55:58.290 --> 56:01.430]  Aw, slid right in the frame like it was a Bethesda game.
[56:01.470 --> 56:02.230]  Way to fucking go.
[56:02.250 --> 56:03.450]  In-world cutscenes.
[56:08.610 --> 56:09.490]  Let's, uh...
[56:10.050 --> 56:12.170]  Anything else in here? I don't think so. I think we're done here.
[56:12.390 --> 56:13.110]  I think we're good.
[56:13.530 --> 56:13.930]  Nice.
[56:14.230 --> 56:15.610]  Climb up this plunger, though.
[56:16.970 --> 56:19.010]  Kind of bullshit, though, that it's not a ground tube.
[56:19.150 --> 56:20.250]  Yeah, I mean...
[56:20.250 --> 56:20.550]  Lazy.
[56:21.310 --> 56:27.230]  You gotta hear it. You gotta put it in your guest bathroom, and then when your guest clogs the toilet, you fucking know they clogged that toilet.
[56:27.470 --> 56:31.730]  I never considered that, and that's the first thing both you and TPG said.
[56:31.730 --> 56:36.490]  Really? Yeah, that's the first thing I thought of was, oh, I'm a... hey, this is about to be fucked.
[56:37.130 --> 56:37.530]  Like...
[56:38.170 --> 56:39.970]  You're about to, like, make an enemy.
[56:40.290 --> 56:41.310]  Like, that's...
[56:42.310 --> 56:43.030]  So bad.
[56:43.290 --> 56:46.090]  Another rat door. I don't think we can do anything with that yet.
[56:46.670 --> 56:47.790]  We just gotta find that last valve.
[56:47.790 --> 56:49.150]  We just gotta find one more of these valves.
[56:49.530 --> 56:54.090]  We're only 30 coins away, and we know there are, like, 10 way up high.
[56:56.650 --> 57:01.170]  Is it around here? I keep looking at that mini-map in the bottom right, thinking it will help me.
[57:01.390 --> 57:02.570]  I just don't think it will.
[57:02.650 --> 57:04.310]  No, I don't think so. I think you gotta keep looking.
[57:06.430 --> 57:07.330]  Where would I put a valve?
[57:07.330 --> 57:07.750]  Oh, coin!
[57:09.910 --> 57:10.630]  Excuse me.
[57:12.170 --> 57:12.530]  Nice!
[57:13.730 --> 57:17.950]  Oh, that was a hidden one, too. That would have been a pain in the ass to find.
[57:18.390 --> 57:23.630]  Just think, as we're doing this, we still get to look at the bonus content, and we get to watch an episode of 1-800-MAGIC.
[57:24.810 --> 57:25.830]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[57:27.430 --> 57:29.830]  So excited. I have another thing I want to do as well.
[57:29.890 --> 57:33.290]  Oh, I love it. I'm very excited.
[57:34.350 --> 57:39.170]  We gotta update our look a little bit, because Rooster Teeth is dead.
[57:39.170 --> 57:41.730]  So I have no reason to have that as the theme.
[57:44.890 --> 57:47.290]  Gotta update it a little bit. Be a little bit more modern.
[57:49.350 --> 57:51.290]  Where the fuck is this valve?
[57:51.310 --> 57:52.710]  I don't know, man. You just gotta keep looking.
[57:52.810 --> 57:55.430]  I'm gonna put it down. It might be up high.
[57:55.630 --> 58:02.510]  Honestly, hit the pepper so it resets, because it's gotta be close to where it spawns and not back here.
[58:03.010 --> 58:04.230]  That's not a bad idea.
[58:04.850 --> 58:05.650]  Yeah, I like it.
[58:06.890 --> 58:07.990]  Is that a launch pad?
[58:08.410 --> 58:08.770]  Yeah.
[58:09.270 --> 58:10.170]  Did I use this before?
[58:10.270 --> 58:10.670]  I think so.
[58:10.730 --> 58:11.230]  Did I go up here?
[58:11.910 --> 58:12.770]  Yeah. Yeah, you did.
[58:12.830 --> 58:13.610]  Oh, I didn't climb this.
[58:13.650 --> 58:14.210]  No, yeah, you did.
[58:15.090 --> 58:15.650]  I did?
[58:15.770 --> 58:15.850]  Yeah.
[58:15.850 --> 58:17.910]  Okay. I have no memory of this.
[58:18.030 --> 58:19.390]  Oh, okay. And I remember this.
[58:19.490 --> 58:19.610]  Yep.
[58:21.970 --> 58:25.270]  I don't see... I was hoping maybe Aerial View could see that valve.
[58:26.170 --> 58:27.330]  Can you use your nose?
[58:27.430 --> 58:27.990]  Let's get back down.
[58:28.850 --> 58:29.650]  I've been trying.
[58:29.830 --> 58:30.050]  Oh.
[58:30.830 --> 58:31.910]  You don't smell shit.
[58:32.910 --> 58:33.770]  Yeah, we know.
[58:36.210 --> 58:40.130]  I wonder how long Pat Nozzle spent recording voiceover for this game.
[58:40.470 --> 58:41.490]  Is this one afternoon?
[58:42.350 --> 58:43.910]  I hope it was a really long time.
[58:44.310 --> 58:45.170]  I hope it was arduous.
[58:48.130 --> 58:53.010]  Behind the scenes footage is him, like, sprinting in the studio, like, whenever you see Robin Williams do VO stuff.
[58:54.510 --> 58:56.410]  Alright, dude, it's gotta be on the ground somewhere.
[58:57.690 --> 58:58.290]  You think so?
[58:58.310 --> 59:00.210]  Yeah, because you can't bring a pepper up here.
[59:02.090 --> 59:04.070]  See, look, that's a valve right there.
[59:05.770 --> 59:07.490]  On the wall over there.
[59:07.970 --> 59:08.630]  Can you get to it?
[59:08.630 --> 59:09.470]  It's not the valve we need.
[59:09.550 --> 59:09.750]  No, it's...
[59:09.750 --> 59:13.670]  I'm just... I'm saying as, like, a proof of concept, that is a valve.
[59:13.850 --> 59:15.670]  Yeah, but you can't bring a pepper up to it.
[59:16.170 --> 59:17.810]  But there might be a pepper somewhere up here.
[59:17.950 --> 59:18.850]  I don't think so.
[59:20.430 --> 59:20.910]  Uh-huh.
[59:21.350 --> 59:22.930]  I think it's gonna be close to those peppers.
[59:25.410 --> 59:25.770]  Okay.
[59:27.750 --> 59:28.870]  I think it's gotta be.
[59:29.030 --> 59:30.430]  I think it's gotta be.
[59:33.590 --> 59:34.750]  Where else could it be?
[59:34.950 --> 59:35.510]  I don't know.
[59:36.330 --> 59:37.010]  It's not over there.
[59:37.770 --> 59:39.210]  Let's run all the way down here.
[59:39.390 --> 59:41.570]  Okay, that's the water that we just did.
[59:43.330 --> 59:44.130]  This is...
[59:44.550 --> 59:47.110]  Entrance. Doesn't seem like there's a valve here.
[59:48.510 --> 59:48.850]  Okay.
[59:48.970 --> 59:49.170]  Nope.
[59:51.650 --> 59:53.050]  I think it has to be high.
[59:53.330 --> 59:54.050]  I don't think so.
[59:54.290 --> 59:55.430]  I think we're looking for a high valve.
[59:55.450 --> 59:57.150]  But we can't bring the pepper up.
[59:58.510 --> 59:59.870]  So we already did one here.
[01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:01.990]  Is there one like, yeah, in like the back?
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:03.630]  No, not like the back, like the other way.
[01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:04.410]  Stupid fucking frog.
[01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:04.890]  We killed you.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.970]  You're not allowed to be here.
[01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:06.530]  Get out of here.
[01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:08.530]  Um...
[01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:09.230]  No.
[01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:09.970]  Okay.
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:13.790]  And then...
[01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.810]  Nothing over here?
[01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:17.270]  I don't think we've...
[01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:19.110]  No, yeah, there's...
[01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:19.450]  Hmm.
[01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.550]  I'm gonna climb up just to see.
[01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:25.810]  What's going on up here?
[01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:26.690]  Nothing up here.
[01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:30.230]  The realest fire in the world.
[01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:34.990]  Uh...
[01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:36.990]  I'll climb up the broom.
[01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:40.650]  Once again, see maybe an aerial view.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.760]  No, we're not.
[01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:54.950]  Wish I could just destroy this ball so you would stop tripping by it.
[01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.950]  Okay, now we went through here.
[01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.550]  I don't, like, I don't know where else it could be if it was on the ground.
[01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:02.710]  We went everywhere.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.840]  Through here.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.140]  Where could you be?
[01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:33.930]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.480]  I'm beginning to think that they gave them one line per level.
[01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:47.890]  Can't hit those.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.680]  Can't climb that.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.040]  Now, I don't think it'll be higher than this.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:00.760]  Yeah, right.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:02.720]  Like...
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.400]  Oh.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.320]  Are those, like, twisty tap valves over there?
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.360]  I guess, maybe, yeah, but that's not what this is, right?
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.140]  Let's, uh, go up again.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:16.460]  Okay.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.020]  And then maybe work our way over to there.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.820]  This is why people need the Achievement Guide, you know?
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.340]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.700]  And we're finding... there.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.040]  We're up here now.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:31.780]  There you go.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.000]  There you go.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:33.940]  Shut up.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:34.980]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:35.900]  Get these coins.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:38.500]  74.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.400]  Even if we don't get the valve up here, I'm happy with this.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.520]  Yeah, right? This is good.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.100]  74.
[01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:50.810]  Gimme em. Gimme em.
[01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.550]  Nom nom nom nom nom nom.
[01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:55.950]  I didn't even notice that there was a third one.
[01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:58.430]  Oh, we're killing it.
[01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:59.010]  Damn.
[01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:00.550]  We're almost there, too.
[01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.050]  Look at this.
[01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.190]  Gonna put us at 81?
[01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:02.810]  83?
[01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.070]  Wow.
[01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:05.550]  Be at 83.
[01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.890]  Almost there, dude.
[01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:13.470]  Okay, uh...
[01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:14.570]  Do we go down now?
[01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.890]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if there's another...
[01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:19.090]  I don't know if there's, like, another way.
[01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.570]  Okay, that's not what I was trying to do.
[01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.950]  It's the way it goes.
[01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.550]  Oh my god, did it reset?
[01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:25.550]  No. Okay, thank god.
[01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.590]  Use the chili pepper to blow the valve up.
[01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:31.790]  Okay, we did that.
[01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.910]  I know how that works.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:40.760]  Okay.
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.020]  I thought it would stop.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.000]  I wouldn't think it would just continuously...
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:44.120]  Yeah.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:44.700]  ...attack.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.320]  So let's go the other way.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:50.480]  Uh...
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.060]  I wanna get back there.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:52.720]  Yeah.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.700]  Cause you can kinda hear water or something.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.860]  Yeah, there's... there maybe?
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.440]  But maybe that's the bathroom that we're hearing.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.000]  I don't know.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.740]  Oh, I'm with you. I have no idea.
[01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:10.090]  Here we go. That's what I was looking at from across the way.
[01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:15.230]  Maybe get up here and then...
[01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.670]  Oh.
[01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:19.310]  We blow these up? We can...
[01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.150]  We can blow these up, right? With the pepper?
[01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:23.110]  At the last level, we blew up those boxes?
[01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.290]  Oh, I don't... I don't know if that sounds right.
[01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:36.130]  Oh yeah, that's where I boiled myself. Let's not do that again.
[01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:38.730]  Right? Right?
[01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:41.210]  Man, I'm really... I don't know, dude.
[01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:43.050]  I'm... I... I... I'm thinking.
[01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:44.590]  I'm think... I'm like...
[01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:47.550]  I just don't know...
[01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:49.310]  I just don't know.
[01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.150]  Like, where would the other valve be?
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.680]  I'm gonna... I'm gonna try blowing up.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.980]  Okay, yeah, go for it.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.840]  Not this time.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.180]  Not this time.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.000]  Let's, uh...
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.100]  Can I get on a ball while I'm holding a pepper?
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.160]  I don't think so. I think it's one at a time.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.840]  No, I definitely can't.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:20.180]  Yeah.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:23.880]  Uh...
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.600]  Oh my god.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.980]  I just wanna try this.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.300]  Okay.
[01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.790]  Great.
[01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.830]  Okay.
[01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:42.070]  I hate that we don't even have, like, a prompt.
[01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:42.810]  No, no, it's...
[01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:44.250]  And also, what's the point of this?
[01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:44.670]  I...
[01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:45.830]  If it doesn't guide you...
[01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:46.930]  It doesn't guide you!
[01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.550]  Yeah, you also only have one health, I think.
[01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:50.550]  I do.
[01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:51.350]  Yeah. Right.
[01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:52.430]  I'm just, you know...
[01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:53.790]  I'm not, like, worried about it.
[01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:54.630]  There's a thief in this room.
[01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:55.850]  He must be...
[01:05:55.850 --> 01:06:00.710]  Okay, so that was for the frog.
[01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:01.090]  Mm-hmm.
[01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:07.910]  I agree. I feel like it has to be kind of around here.
[01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.230]  It has to be! It doesn't make any sense for it to be anywhere else.
[01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.030]  Right bumper.
[01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.830]  Spill.
[01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.410]  The spill coming from the bathroom, we already did that.
[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:18.370]  So now we just have to be on the lookout for a right bumper thing.
[01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:26.310]  Oh my god.
[01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.310]  Jesus Christ.
[01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:28.830]  Did he...
[01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:30.610]  Was he as repetitive last level?
[01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:31.410]  I don't remember.
[01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:32.390]  I really don't.
[01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:34.870]  I don't remember him being this bad.
[01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.250]  Uh-uh.
[01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:37.910]  I can't figure out...
[01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:39.530]  I can't fucking figure out where he went.
[01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:41.530]  I need the health, so...
[01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.550]  If you go down there to, like, the left...
[01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:47.190]  Like, I'm thinking about it in, like, terms of...
[01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:48.870]  Okay, we did the one there and then the one there.
[01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.090]  Like, we moved in, like, a way.
[01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:51.770]  And then do you keep going?
[01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:54.850]  Like, if you go, like, left from here, is there a valve somewhere down there?
[01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:02.370]  I mean, we got that, which we're obviously gonna break at some point.
[01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:05.570]  I wonder if there's a way to, like...
[01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:09.970]  No, that sounds like water, and that's not the bathroom.
[01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:10.350]  No, uh-uh.
[01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:10.970]  Is it the bathroom?
[01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:12.850]  It is the bathroom.
[01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:13.270]  Maybe it's the bathroom.
[01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.530]  Yeah.
[01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:17.710]  I wish I could fucking turn this thing off.
[01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:19.890]  It's so annoying.
[01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:24.850]  I think you gotta keep going this way. Keep going this way.
[01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.870]  Okay.
[01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:27.530]  Just keep moving.
[01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:31.710]  I just don't know where the fuck you're moving.
[01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.530]  I don't even know where we're supposed to take the valves.
[01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:35.970]  No, but, like, that's the thing.
[01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.950]  We can't, we don't know where the last one is.
[01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:41.550]  It, like, none of it matters because it's not gonna prompt us.
[01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:52.550]  At least we're being very thorough when it comes to the coins.
[01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:53.030]  Yeah.
[01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:55.290]  We're gonna have this place mapped out.
[01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:59.250]  We just need this stupid valve.
[01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.630]  Yep.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.280]  Did all this already.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.720]  Not through here.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.560]  I just don't know where else to go.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:16.900]  Right.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:18.820]  I'm baffled.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.820]  I have, I mean, I'm beside myself. I have no fucking idea.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.360]  Was there any water? Let's go back to the, uh...
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.820]  Let's go back to...
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.440]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.720]  Oh, it's telling you to go somewhere?
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.300]  We got something. We got something. We got something.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.500]  Why is it telling you suddenly?
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.060]  I don't know.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.200]  Wait, wait, hit the button again.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.260]  Okay, keep going.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.760]  Wait, hit right bumper. Hit right bumper. Hit right bumper.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.180]  Watch out for the chef you're done for if he sees you.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.340]  But I don't understand. What does that mean?
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.540]  Like, what?
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.260]  I don't know.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.700]  We're just gonna get through this?
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:56.140]  Hit right bumper again.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.220]  We're supposed to go this way?
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.100]  I don't understand. I don't fucking get it.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:04.480]  What?
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.000]  Keep going.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.580]  Is it the valve that we were looking at before?
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.280]  No.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.180]  That wall valve?
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:19.840]  No. No fucking chance.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:20.280]  No.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:20.660]  See, look.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.400]  You have to go in front.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.580]  What are you doing? What are you doing?!
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.200]  I don't know. I don't know!
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.960]  Why did you stop right there? Don't stop in front of him. You stopped in front of him.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.020]  I don't know. Where did...
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.600]  Okay, we're going back.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.940]  It said specifically don't let him see you and you went, that's right. Look at me.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.740]  The thing that tells me where to go told me to go there.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.000]  I don't think we're supposed to.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.080]  Well then what's the point in the nose if I'm not gonna follow it?
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.080]  What are we doing?
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.880]  What is this game doing?
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.840]  When you get up there, hit right bumper again.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.920]  It's...
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.740]  Oh my god!
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:04.420]  Fucking...
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:08.480]  It's amazing there aren't 20 million rats in here with all this fucking caramel everywhere.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.980]  Health violations.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.640]  There should be way more rats than us.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.540]  Jesus Christ.
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.840]  I don't have any right bumper prompts yet.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.100]  Okay.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.320]  Oh, this is probably... I probably gotta go whabam.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.160]  Yep.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.320]  And then that'll get his attention.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:26.980]  Great.
[01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:32.430]  I'm glad they didn't explain that at all.
[01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.350]  Oh my god.
[01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:38.730]  Okay, now what?
[01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.210]  What the fuck?
[01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.170]  What's going...
[01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:44.750]  What?
[01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:45.910]  What?!
[01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:52.570]  Andrew, we've been doing this for like 15 minutes.
[01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:54.690]  Left stick!
[01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:56.990]  What...
[01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:58.010]  And then hit a button. Hit A.
[01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:00.270]  I'm hitting all the buttons.
[01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:01.010]  Okay, here we go.
[01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:03.290]  I think you just... Okay, there you go.
[01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:05.250]  And you keep it like in the middle. There you go.
[01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:06.310]  I don't know.
[01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.970]  This is...
[01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:07.990]  I don't know what...
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.080]  I don't understand. Does he kill the toad with the knife or what?
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.920]  I don't know.
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.560]  Oh, both of them.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.720]  So I just gotta keep... Okay.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.540]  Keep him in the green. Keep him in the green. There you go.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.780]  So it's not like I don't have to hit a button.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.000]  No.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.440]  It's just how long it takes.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:29.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.340]  Because you're trying to fill up a meter that you're not able to look at because you're doing some other stuff.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.100]  So just keep it in the middle. There you go.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.660]  You're doing good. You're doing good.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.280]  You're doing good.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:40.760]  Is the meter filling?
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.420]  Yes, it is.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.740]  You're almost there.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.040]  Are you sure about that?
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:46.200]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.020]  Are you sure about that?
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:53.460]  It's done.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.540]  You did it.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.240]  You win.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:58.960]  Yeah, I did it.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:00.980]  No!
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.600]  I don't understand. So what was different?
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.520]  So you didn't hit... So you needed to hit a button?
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.980]  I was hitting all the buttons.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.260]  And I think the thing you thought was a meter was the timer going down.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.880]  Why would there be two timers?
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.700]  There was time at the top of the screen.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.720]  I can't argue that point, but I think it was a timer.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.940]  I can't argue that point.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:30.340]  Okay.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:31.800]  Okay.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.720]  Hit the toast again.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.120]  Hit the bread.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.920]  So what do you have to do?
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.380]  I like that he hides behind that bottle.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.720]  Gotta like hit A?
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.800]  I was mashing A, and it wasn't doing anything.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:45.780]  Oh my god.
[01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:55.130]  I swear, if it makes me do this again, because it was slow...
[01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.470]  Uh-huh.
[01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:57.270]  Okay.
[01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:00.950]  Hey, little chef. Are you ready to cook?
[01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:02.010]  Yeah, I'm ready to cook.
[01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:02.930]  You got it.
[01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:04.810]  I don't.
[01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:08.230]  You sure you don't have to hit a button once it's in like the middle?
[01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:09.470]  You don't have to hit A?
[01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:12.510]  I'm hitting the triggers.
[01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:16.030]  See, like that?
[01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:20.510]  Right stick, A, there you go, and then both of them A.
[01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:22.210]  Yeah, like that.
[01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:23.650]  It's not A, it's like the triggers.
[01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:24.650]  Oh, why would it be that?
[01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:25.050]  You have to click the triggers.
[01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:25.610]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.890]  Or right trigger.
[01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.910]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:32.650]  Well, keep doing it, because you're keeping it above the line now, so you're good.
[01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:33.530]  Okay.
[01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.930]  You're doing great. You're doing great.
[01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:39.030]  Now, like, what you're doing is the right thing.
[01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:39.810]  You are winning.
[01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:45.530]  Are we making something? I can't even look. It's like Cuphead.
[01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:45.790]  Yeah.
[01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:46.910]  I can't see what's happening.
[01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:47.810]  Yeah, no, you got it.
[01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:51.850]  Yeah, you're making, um, probably like some of those squids.
[01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:53.490]  Maybe something with like the frog.
[01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.190]  Yeah, maybe something with the frog, I'm not sure.
[01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:57.630]  How's Remy looking? Is he looking good?
[01:13:57.630 --> 01:14:00.790]  Oh, dude, he's fucking, he's yanking hair like you've never seen.
[01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.050]  Hell yeah.
[01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:04.510]  You got, you got yellow basil.
[01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:06.370]  Spinach.
[01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:08.430]  That looks like basil.
[01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:11.250]  Yeah, I don't give a fuck about spinach. Do you have a valve?
[01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:16.310]  What?
[01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:19.250]  Oh, no, I have to do this three times.
[01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:20.890]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:24.830]  And it's a minute long.
[01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:29.250]  Ugh.
[01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:38.290]  Why is there no end? Why do I just need to go until it runs out? Why isn't there an end to this?
[01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:40.290]  I don't understand.
[01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:45.930]  Recipes don't work this way. You don't throw ingredients in the entire cooking time.
[01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:50.890]  Also, what is that cutting form? It's like he's slamming a tar.
[01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:54.770]  Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, he's being controlled by a rat, so I couldn't imagine it's very good.
[01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:55.150]  That's fair.
[01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:55.910]  Cutting, you know?
[01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:57.850]  It's like good enough.
[01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:06.770]  There is an alternate universe where Ratatouille is a sports movie, and it's like Air Bud, and I wish we lived in that universe.
[01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.830]  What if the plot of Ratatouille 2 was the guy loses his hair?
[01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:15.470]  Oh, wow.
[01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:16.930]  What would they do?
[01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.330]  Yep.
[01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:19.250]  That's tough.
[01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:21.150]  What'd you get? A snail?
[01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:25.950]  Escargot. I bet you I'm gonna have to do this a third time.
[01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:31.970]  Yeah, you fucking know you do, baby. One more time. One more time. One more time.
[01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:37.610]  You're great, dude. You're like a master chef now, though. Like, you got this figured out.
[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:39.730]  The master chef.
[01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:40.330]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:44.110]  It's gonna be my cookbook name, Active Gamer to Master Chef.
[01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:45.410]  Active Gamer.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:53.960]  Do you think there's anyone on Xbox Live with the gamertag Active Gamer?
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.140]  They have to be. There has to be someone, right?
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:00.420]  Let's see. As soon as we do this, let's quickly figure that out.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.740]  I'll look it up.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.680]  I wanna be friends with Active Gamer.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.500]  The bar's full. I mean, I don't think I need to do anything and we'd be fine.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:19.780]  Right.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.220]  I'm gonna keep clicking, because why not?
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.020]  Active Gamer. Gamer score of 12,757.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.760]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:30.420]  They play Sea of Thieves and Halo Infinite. Are you sure this isn't you?
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:31.620]  Really?
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.040]  Yeah.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.260]  But, like, last played, like, two years ago. It looks like they don't play anymore.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:37.900]  No!
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.340]  But this could all just be outdated information, you know what I mean?
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.060]  It could be. I'm still gonna send a friend request.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:45.940]  Yeah, just in case.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.900]  Oh, is this dude just gonna rip it from the wall?
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:52.540]  He is. I can't believe that's the fucking valve, dude.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.980]  We looked at that so many times.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:56.900]  It just doesn't, like...
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.800]  We need something like that.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.360]  It doesn't fucking follow the rules.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.880]  Oh, and that's how you beat, guys? And that's how you get the 20 gold achievement of Beat the Chili Pepper Volley.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:07.520]  Easy.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.260]  Easy. Let's wrap this up. Let's save and quit. Looks like it's a bonus content.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.700]  I love it. I love it.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:19.300]  Advance. Okay, we're here. Perfect.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:25.040]  We did it, guys. This is how you do it. This is how you achieve. This is how you achieve, baby.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.420]  This is how you achieve.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.440]  Hey, Andrew, you can do better.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.180]  We're going to do better next time.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:30.800]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.200]  And we're going to enjoy what we have achieved and looking at this great bonus content.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:38.920]  Which is...
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:40.560]  Active Gamer.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.860]  Uh-huh. Yeah.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.200]  Gotta get through all this.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.720]  And bonus.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.620]  I think it's like 10. I think it's like way in there.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.060]  Yeah, it's 10.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.860]  Like 10, 11. Yeah, there you go.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:51.740]  Whoa.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.120]  They look fucked.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.740]  It's like in that scene in Indiana Jones and all their faces melt.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.920]  Like they've seen something they're not supposed to be seeing.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.740]  They have pupils like a Rick and Morty episode.
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:08.740]  That's terrifying.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.660]  That's fucked.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.500]  Oh, man. That sucks. That's you.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.240]  Oh, man. That's all back. That is me.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.880]  You heard about that.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.040]  The back just doesn't end.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:24.960]  That's great.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.540]  Oh, look at how nice. The little rat looks so nice.
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.080]  It's like, what the fuck are you?
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.500]  He's like, I just want this cheese.
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.180]  And then...
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:38.800]  Now, see.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.940]  Establishing shot. Look at beautiful. Beautiful.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.100]  Establishing shot of the kitchen day.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.860]  Doesn't look like that in the game.
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.120]  No. Where are the valves? Where's the toad?
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.840]  Show me the squid stomping around or whatever.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:53.660]  OK.
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:57.980]  Now that we got the bonus content out of the way.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:01.480]  You want to watch an episode of 1-800-MAGIC?
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.260]  We're going to.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.860]  Before we do that, I want to first update my system a little bit.
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.360]  What does that mean?
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:09.640]  Well, you're going to find out.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:13.260]  As you know, the marketplace is going away.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.580]  And I saw some things I need to acquire real quick.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.700]  We're just going to put Redman into the thing.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.440]  And first of all, I need the Redman picture pack for Console Kings.
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.440]  So let's get that.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:28.800]  It's a dollar?
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.460]  Let's spend a dollar to buy.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.980]  You're a maniac.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.060]  Picture Kings.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.320]  Listen, celebrities, gamers, models, and events. I support it.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.500]  Redman goes wild with the 360 in the Console Kings celebrity picture pack.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.640]  Dude, what the fuck?
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.880]  I don't think Console Kings is around anymore.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:50.260]  We went to the website, so this doesn't pay anyone.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.740]  I'm just putting a dollar in a tube that's going nowhere.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.540]  Absolutely. 100%.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.360]  I hope it lets me buy it.
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:19:59.660]  I hope it does too.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.460]  Hell yeah!
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.220]  Great, man.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:01.760]  Okay.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.660]  But I'm not done.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.320]  Oh, cool.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.540]  We're just getting started.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.220]  We've got to get the Redman theme as well.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:08.260]  What?
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:09.260]  We've got to get that Redman.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.180]  73 cents?
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.080]  Yeah, well, it's less.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.280]  You know, they got a few photos with the picture pack.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.600]  This is just one thing.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:23.720]  I assume.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.440]  I don't imagine there's a variety.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.200]  You can't buy anything for 73 cents anymore.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.920]  No, this is a great deal.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.980]  A steal at twice the price.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.860]  I think gumballs are 50 cents now.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:36.340]  Yeah, right?
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.220]  Are they still 25?
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.300]  No, there's no way.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.260]  Has there been gumball inflation?
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.960]  I don't know the last time I bought a gumball, so I couldn't tell you.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.620]  Oh, check it, dude.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.440]  You got a Redman theme.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:44.900]  Let's go.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:46.940]  Oh, yeah.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:47.360]  Give it to me.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:48.260]  Apply theme.
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:49.700]  What?
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.220]  What?
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:50.780]  No.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.440]  Uh-oh.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.440]  I think that was me.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.040]  Yeah, I can't imagine that it was the console.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.220]  System...
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:02.380]  How do I do this?
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:03.340]  Console settings, maybe?
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:03.820]  No.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:05.480]  Profile.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:07.940]  I have no fucking idea.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:08.460]  Edit profile.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:10.600]  No.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:11.820]  Ooh, gamer picture.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.580]  We're gonna...
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:13.400]  Gamer picture, yep.
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.480]  Let's put Redman public.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.680]  Oh, hell yeah!
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.300]  That's pretty cool.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:21.540]  Hell yeah!
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.540]  He's stiff, Herman.
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.480]  He's got the 360 in there.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:25.900]  Can you go down more or no?
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:26.600]  Is there...
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:27.920]  Oh, there you go.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:28.480]  I thought so.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:32.400]  I had a feeling that there was gonna be another one.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.800]  That, to me, is the one right there.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:35.120]  That's it?
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:35.700]  Yeah.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.440]  He's holding the controller upside down like that's the guy.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:39.180]  Oh.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.260]  Very cool.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.980]  Now, if only we knew how to change themes.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.000]  How do we change themes?
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.440]  It's gotta be...
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.040]  Well, next time.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:49.540]  Preferences?
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.140]  We'll do it next time.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.320]  Could it be preferences?
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:53.100]  That makes sense.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.160]  No.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:54.520]  Nope.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.220]  How is it not under system?
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.420]  I don't...
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:00.420]  It would definitely not be under this!
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.840]  Where all of your credit card information is stored!
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:04.800]  Eh, it's not there.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:09.260]  Well, either way...
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:09.720]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.340]  What I want is...
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.620]  I want an episode of 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.400]  We're doing it.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.000]  Oh, thank God.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:17.560]  We're loading in.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.260]  Cool.
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:20.620]  Part three of four.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:21.480]  I'm excited.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:27.680]  Uh, do you know if this is gonna be in widescreen or in regular definition like the way we changed
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.280]  from Ratatouille first gameplay to like the rest of it?
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.600]  Yeah, so our video got fucked up.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.880]  I don't know why that happened.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:35.640]  I don't...
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.640]  Maybe it is 1-800-MAGIC?
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.020]  Uh-huh.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.440]  You think it's possible that that would adjust the settings?
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:40.920]  It could.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:42.840]  Who knows?
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.200]  We'll see.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.240]  Uh-huh.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.600]  Uh...
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.880]  Red versus blue.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:49.100]  Nope.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.000]  Why would you go to red versus blue?
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.500]  It's 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.160]  It's own thing.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.560]  Episode three, not four.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:55.900]  Three.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:56.620]  Yeah, baby.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:57.340]  Not four.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:57.720]  Uh-huh.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.680]  Here we go.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:01.640]  Here we go.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.200]  There's not even...
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.260]  This is great.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.100]  Do you think that this is on the audio network?
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.900]  Ooh, probably.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:14.920]  Uh-huh.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:15.600]  What?
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:16.520]  Episode three.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:22.940]  The hotline operator insists that magic doesn't exist and claims Bitterman didn't teleport,
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.180]  but instead experienced some, quote, minor lag in the system.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:27.580]  Gotcha.
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.360]  He says there's no such thing as magic.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.140]  But Bitterman just teleported.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:31.920]  Tell him, Bitterman.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.600]  Yeah, but Bitterman just teleported, Eric.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:33.880]  Yeah.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:34.560]  Bitterman didn't teleport.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:35.180]  What?
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.620]  He was just experiencing some minor lag in the system.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:37.940]  What?
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.880]  Are you kidding me?
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.260]  Minor lag in the system?
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.120]  That guy teleported and you're gonna...
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:42.280]  What?
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.920]  No, I don't want to talk to your manager.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.580]  From your point of view, it just seems...
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:50.640]  Now, imagine being a massive company and watching this.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:50.880]  Yeah.
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.300]  And thinking, we need to buy this.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.180]  Well, I mean...
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:55.120]  We need to buy all of it.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:58.480]  I mean, again, the issue is we're judging it through today's...
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.060]  Oh, what?
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:01.760]  What?
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:04.520]  What?
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:06.560]  Why?
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.620]  Why did that happen?
[01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:14.350]  We have to watch it again!
[01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:16.590]  No, we can resume. It's fine.
[01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:16.910]  Okay.
[01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:17.850]  We can resume.
[01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:21.810]  See, the issue is you're watching it through today's eyes.
[01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:27.170]  At the time when this was coming out, like 2008 or whatever, this was like cutting...
[01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:28.050]  This was...
[01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:30.750]  Yeah, I'm shit-talking you, but I know I love this.
[01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:31.350]  Oh, absolutely!
[01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:33.010]  I thought this was great.
[01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:33.270]  Yeah.
[01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:40.850]  Yeah.
[01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:41.230]  Oh, man.
[01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:44.250]  Oh, 1-800-MAGIC!
[01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:45.230]  We haven't even started.
[01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:48.470]  That's it, baby.
[01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:49.500]  1-800-MAGIC.
[01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:51.130]  Check it out.
[01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:52.470]  He's experiencing some lag.
[01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:58.070]  I do.
[01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.630]  Howie Mandel?
[01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:14.250]  This is how we do it.
[01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:19.490]  Yeah, he brings his mentor and teacher, Howie, do it.
[01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.030]  And this is how we do it.
[01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:27.890]  I've been watching Deal or No Deal Island.
[01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:30.210]  Which is Deal or No Deal mixed with Survivor.
[01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:33.310]  And they keep teasing who the banker's gonna be.
[01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:34.430]  Like, they're gonna do a big reveal.
[01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:35.630]  It has to be Howie, right?
[01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:36.250]  It has to be Howie Mandel, yeah.
[01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:39.130]  It has to be him.
[01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:41.190]  Whoa!
[01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:45.270]  Different time.
[01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:49.070]  Different time.
[01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:55.650]  If you're watching this, you probably weren't alive when this came out anyway, so it doesn't matter.
[01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:58.130]  It's true.
[01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:09.030]  Shouldn't we re-horde?
[01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:11.010]  You know, grammatically speaking.
[01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:13.470]  How about re-collective?
[01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:16.570]  I like it. It's snappy.
[01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:21.470]  If it's a guy that killed Bigfoot, blast him.
[01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:23.770]  We did decide blast him was better, right?
[01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:25.050]  Yeah, blast him, smoke him.
[01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:25.490]  Wow.
[01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.490]  Do you think Control-Alt-Delete holds up better than this?
[01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:31.290]  Oh, dude, it's gonna be so much worse, you have no fucking idea.
[01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:35.630]  Like, you watch this and you don't think the writing's strong or whatever.
[01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:42.950]  And it's not like it's blowing you away, but Control-Alt-Delete is going to be a rough ride.
[01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:47.130]  It's going to be a very active gamer situation.
[01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:49.110]  Like, big time.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.180]  That is wrong, man.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.000]  That's wrong, man.
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.080]  That is just wrong.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.500]  Why would these big monsters have guns like this?
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.560]  I don't know.
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.700]  I want to buy that necklace, though.
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.780]  Yeah, that's pretty cool. You should have a necklace like that.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.600]  I think I'd be a bone necklace guy.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.920]  Oh my god, that would be so sick.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:29.220]  It's already a thing where, like...
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:32.620]  When we found out you had, like, long hair and a beard, it's like, what the fuck?
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.900]  Whoa, that's not how I pictured it. I just didn't expect it.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:36.760]  And then, um...
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.300]  If you were like, yeah, I have that and I'm a bone necklace guy, that'd be sick.
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.660]  I gotta grow my hair back out.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:43.300]  Hell yeah!
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:47.180]  Because I think you're right. I think I need long hair with the bone necklace.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.580]  I don't think I'm going to have short hair and a bone necklace. I don't think those fit.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.120]  You can't be clean cut with a bone necklace.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.640]  Man, this is still going, huh?
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.640]  Yeah, every time.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:03.220]  Are you going to be sad when this goes away?
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.800]  There's only one episode left. We're almost near the finale.
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:10.620]  Yeah, yeah, the finale of this, but then we get to go to watch Control Delete or whatever.
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.820]  Or whatever that bear show is.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.380]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.520]  Do you think they had requirements from the developer? Being like, it would be really great if you could show...
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.580]  Yes! Oh, a hundred percent!
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.600]  That's all this is, is requirements from the developer.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:35.060]  Do a summon, like, yeah, a hundred percent.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:35.660]  Oh man, it's over.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:36.540]  Oh, shucks.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.580]  Visit wayhighermagic.com for more, guys.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.980]  Oh, there is no more today!
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.840]  No, honestly, honestly, go subscribe to our Patreon and listen to the podcast for more.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:51.220]  Yes.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:56.580]  And then make fun of this in like 15 years and go like, what were they thinking? Because that's fine.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:57.820]  That's just fine.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:03.340]  If you have any 1-800-MAGIC questions, we may know a guy that could answer those.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:08.200]  We'll make sure, we'll get back to you on your hard-hitting 1-800-MAGIC analysis.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:09.000]  Fucking great.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.020]  Thank you so much for joining me, Eric.
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:10.580]  Thank you.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:16.380]  Radifory on that one. I'm ready for Radifyvy. I'm ready to keep going. We're going to beat this fucking thing, dude.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:19.300]  We're going to fucking destroy this thing.
