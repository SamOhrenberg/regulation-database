[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  I don't care what Eric says.
[00:01.460 --> 00:02.340]  We're still going to stream.
[00:03.280 --> 00:03.920]  That's right.
[00:06.640 --> 00:07.900]  He's very opposed. He can't stop us.
[00:08.480 --> 00:10.280]  Yeah, I don't know what his problem is on that.
[00:11.060 --> 00:11.380]  Crazy.
[00:13.700 --> 00:14.340]  Oh, Christ.
[00:14.660 --> 00:15.380]  I love it. It's a good bit.
[00:15.680 --> 00:16.440]  Thank you. Thank you.
[00:16.460 --> 00:17.640]  Thank you. It never gets old.
[00:19.180 --> 00:20.360]  Ready up. Even when he's here.
[00:20.960 --> 00:22.080]  Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
[00:22.160 --> 00:23.620]  I forgot I have to ready up on my way.
[00:23.660 --> 00:24.640]  Oh, that's OK. That's OK.
[00:24.640 --> 00:26.280]  Going back to the table.
[00:26.360 --> 00:27.640]  I was just exploring a little bit.
[00:27.720 --> 00:29.320]  I feel like there has to be like a
[00:29.840 --> 00:31.140]  weapons vendor or something.
[00:31.300 --> 00:32.860]  I haven't really talked to all the people around here.
[00:34.240 --> 00:35.340]  Oh, yeah, I haven't talked to anybody.
[00:35.560 --> 00:37.720]  And there's the guy that you can buy relics and emotes from.
[00:38.040 --> 00:39.060]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:41.520 --> 00:43.080]  Also, hey, everybody, we're playing.
[00:43.880 --> 00:44.520]  What is this?
[00:44.540 --> 00:45.400]  Elden Ring, Night Ring?
[00:45.520 --> 00:46.480]  Yeah, what's up, piss rats?
[00:46.480 --> 00:47.360]  Night Rain.
[00:47.960 --> 00:51.200]  Oh, my God. Admiral Chops, thank you so much for the subs.
[00:51.740 --> 00:52.480]  Admiral Chops.
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.120]  You are you're seeing the second time we've played this game today.
[00:57.140 --> 00:59.140]  The first time we did a let's play this morning.
[00:59.320 --> 01:00.480]  Cut our teeth in it, as you will.
[01:00.840 --> 01:04.240]  By now, we're quite possibly the best Elden Ring players on Earth.
[01:06.560 --> 01:09.260]  So prepare for a master class.
[01:10.820 --> 01:13.540]  Yeah, the obscure game, Elden Ring.
[01:15.020 --> 01:17.820]  The massive by the Master Gamesman,
[01:17.880 --> 01:20.660]  the Mechanic, Baby Pepsi and Gizmo.
[01:22.200 --> 01:23.900]  Yeah, we have to do this fucking thing again.
[01:25.860 --> 01:27.460]  So where are we dropping?
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.280]  Tomato Town, right?
[01:30.780 --> 01:35.940]  Do we control it or is this just we just we don't really control it now.
[01:36.060 --> 01:39.100]  OK, we have the sausage talk today.
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.660]  Why? Thank you very much.
[01:40.860 --> 01:42.780]  Oh, the sausage talk came out. That's exciting.
[01:43.340 --> 01:44.760]  Yeah, we're big sausage talk fan.
[01:45.460 --> 01:46.040]  Oh, me too.
[01:47.500 --> 01:51.320]  It's the thing I feel the least confident about in whenever we make going into it.
[01:51.380 --> 01:52.140]  What? Really? Why?
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.960]  I just I always go through a process of like, what are we going to talk about?
[01:56.960 --> 02:01.820]  Because it's so unscheduled or not unscheduled, but like unplanned
[02:01.820 --> 02:03.420]  as far as like going into it.
[02:03.800 --> 02:08.140]  Well, we do them so infrequently, we can't help but have a million things to talk about.
[02:08.520 --> 02:10.420]  Sure. Oh, oh.
[02:11.780 --> 02:13.260]  I'm almost dead already.
[02:13.720 --> 02:14.580]  That's not really.
[02:15.500 --> 02:20.120]  So we, Jesus, did we essentially always restart as level one?
[02:20.700 --> 02:21.960]  I guess none of our shit.
[02:22.560 --> 02:23.660]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[02:23.660 --> 02:25.000]  Just trying to level up.
[02:25.400 --> 02:26.520]  You're just trying to fit in again.
[02:28.060 --> 02:29.040]  Why won't it let me?
[02:29.320 --> 02:31.860]  OK, oh, level me up.
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.180]  Oh, here, let's get these fools.
[02:33.280 --> 02:34.740]  Need some more. Oh, good call, Nick.
[02:34.800 --> 02:35.460]  Good eyes.
[02:38.160 --> 02:39.000]  Get them. Get them.
[02:39.000 --> 02:39.400]  All right, guys.
[02:40.520 --> 02:41.460]  They were on cleaning detail.
[02:42.560 --> 02:42.980]  That should be enough.
[02:43.320 --> 02:44.520]  Level two. Unstoppable.
[02:44.720 --> 02:45.660]  That should be enough. I want to be in.
[02:47.120 --> 02:49.000]  We got more people over here to the right.
[02:49.840 --> 02:50.260]  Level two.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.580]  Oh, he's got red eyes.
[02:51.680 --> 02:52.460]  That seems scary.
[02:53.020 --> 02:54.300]  Oh, they're fire people.
[02:54.820 --> 02:55.960]  I vaguely remember.
[02:56.480 --> 02:57.840]  OK, do not let that bar fill up.
[02:57.960 --> 02:59.180]  You will instantly die.
[03:00.300 --> 03:01.560]  Don't know what that means.
[03:01.780 --> 03:04.320]  If you get hit by it, you will get like a Lord of the Rings
[03:04.320 --> 03:06.120]  Sauron eye type thing.
[03:06.520 --> 03:07.260]  Oh, OK.
[03:07.920 --> 03:08.840]  I am familiar with Sauron.
[03:08.940 --> 03:10.160]  Do not get hit by it.
[03:11.060 --> 03:12.700]  Yeah, let's keep looking around.
[03:13.880 --> 03:16.900]  There is the cloud of death, just like a regular,
[03:17.560 --> 03:19.160]  what is it, Battle Royale?
[03:19.580 --> 03:20.520]  There is, yes.
[03:20.580 --> 03:21.560]  Oh, should we go to this tower?
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.800]  You want to go to the tower?
[03:23.080 --> 03:24.120]  All right, just let's go to the tower.
[03:24.380 --> 03:25.020]  Oh, hold on.
[03:25.060 --> 03:26.380]  There's dudes to kill right here.
[03:26.380 --> 03:26.840]  Oh shit, I'm down.
[03:27.320 --> 03:28.160]  There's more firemen.
[03:28.180 --> 03:29.500]  I'm not down. I jumped down.
[03:30.040 --> 03:30.420]  Oh no.
[03:33.080 --> 03:34.880]  I don't know why I'm oh noing.
[03:34.920 --> 03:35.740]  I'm just killing dudes.
[03:36.760 --> 03:37.800]  Reused rune acquisition.
[03:38.060 --> 03:38.460]  Hell yeah.
[03:38.540 --> 03:40.440]  There's a tree thing that you guys are going to get.
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.520]  Gonna wanna get.
[03:42.060 --> 03:43.140]  Oh, what the fuck?
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.380]  Where the fuck is Nick?
[03:44.700 --> 03:45.720]  Oh, he dropped down here.
[03:46.320 --> 03:46.760]  Oh, is that the tower?
[03:48.160 --> 03:48.940]  Where's the tree thing?
[03:49.080 --> 03:49.440]  Woohoo.
[03:50.100 --> 03:51.060]  We don't know yet.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.420]  You son of a bitch.
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.400]  Oh, there's a giant ass dragon.
[03:54.600 --> 03:56.000]  There is a giant ass dragon.
[03:56.620 --> 03:58.480]  Is he a dragon like last time?
[03:58.760 --> 04:00.320]  A little goblin?
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.460]  Or is he an actual dragon?
[04:01.480 --> 04:03.080]  Oh, that's a yeah, that's a real dragon.
[04:03.180 --> 04:04.340]  He's a big ass dragon.
[04:04.620 --> 04:06.200]  I don't feel like that's level two.
[04:07.260 --> 04:11.340]  Oh, you know, we're probably going to want to be level three before we fight that dragon.
[04:11.360 --> 04:11.980]  At least three.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.280]  I was thinking even maybe four.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.040]  OK, we should probably do that.
[04:15.060 --> 04:15.800]  Let's check the tower then.
[04:16.340 --> 04:18.380]  I'm going into the mine shaft because I feel like...
[04:18.380 --> 04:19.840]  Yeah, I'm going to the mine shaft.
[04:20.680 --> 04:21.760]  All right, mines it is.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.100]  Let's explore them mines.
[04:28.720 --> 04:30.520]  Oh no, I hit the wall.
[04:31.280 --> 04:32.100]  It's OK, I got you.
[04:32.460 --> 04:33.080]  Thank you.
[04:33.640 --> 04:37.480]  Geoff, when it was rumored that Nick Saban was coming to Texas years ago,
[04:38.100 --> 04:41.200]  when I worked at the radio station, we had this sounder that we made.
[04:41.540 --> 04:45.400]  Instead of mine, mine, it was Saban, Saban, Saban, Saban, Saban.
[04:45.740 --> 04:48.280]  And they're like, oh, the Saban seagulls are back again.
[04:48.760 --> 04:49.240]  That's funny.
[04:49.840 --> 04:50.920]  Oh, who's this bitch?
[04:53.300 --> 04:54.360]  They have a lot of health.
[04:55.820 --> 04:56.020]  Kill him.
[04:56.740 --> 04:57.700]  Ask questions later.
[04:58.160 --> 04:59.320]  Yeah, there's more down here.
[04:59.400 --> 04:59.880]  More miners.
[05:00.680 --> 05:00.900]  Where?
[05:01.940 --> 05:03.100]  Uh, down, drop down.
[05:03.400 --> 05:04.100]  Oh, OK, I see him.
[05:04.500 --> 05:05.400]  This guy's more of a major.
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.740]  See what you did there?
[05:09.100 --> 05:09.580]  He's big.
[05:10.520 --> 05:11.380]  Yeah, he is big.
[05:11.940 --> 05:12.400]  Big boy.
[05:12.740 --> 05:15.060]  Dude, he's getting fucking beat up though.
[05:15.760 --> 05:16.560]  Bullied hard.
[05:16.660 --> 05:17.440]  Damn, he died.
[05:18.240 --> 05:19.120]  Sucks to be you.
[05:19.140 --> 05:19.860]  I'm not a magic guy.
[05:20.480 --> 05:21.900]  What the hell is this?
[05:22.200 --> 05:22.540]  Uh oh.
[05:22.780 --> 05:23.360]  Is this a boss?
[05:23.600 --> 05:24.120]  That's dead.
[05:24.380 --> 05:24.700]  Oh, no.
[05:25.280 --> 05:27.480]  We woke it up, we woke it up.
[05:28.080 --> 05:30.140]  I believe in us.
[05:30.700 --> 05:31.800]  Oh, good fire pot.
[05:32.380 --> 05:33.380]  That was a great fire pot.
[05:34.480 --> 05:36.120]  Oh, he's like laying into the wall.
[05:37.180 --> 05:37.320]  Oh.
[05:38.960 --> 05:39.620]  Power shots.
[05:39.700 --> 05:40.320]  Let him have it.
[05:40.460 --> 05:41.040]  Let him have it.
[05:41.300 --> 05:42.100]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[05:42.100 --> 05:43.080]  Give it to him hard.
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.160]  Oh, he's stomping, he's stomping.
[05:46.500 --> 05:47.120]  Roll away.
[05:48.420 --> 05:49.300]  Oh, he's mad.
[05:49.440 --> 05:50.000]  Get the feet, get the feet.
[05:50.660 --> 05:51.840]  Laura's in contiguity.
[05:54.020 --> 05:55.160]  Oh, Andrew, this is you.
[05:55.680 --> 05:57.640]  Oh, that's me on a sushi container.
[05:57.780 --> 05:58.500]  We nailed it.
[05:59.640 --> 06:03.660]  Heart bow or strengthens uncommon armaments.
[06:04.000 --> 06:05.520]  I don't know what the fuck that is, but I'll take it.
[06:05.560 --> 06:06.340]  All right, I got a giant.
[06:07.020 --> 06:09.140]  Hey, there's a treasure chest room in here, boys.
[06:09.280 --> 06:09.440]  Oh.
[06:10.500 --> 06:11.440]  All right, be right there.
[06:13.000 --> 06:13.160]  Oh.
[06:15.920 --> 06:16.120]  No.
[06:16.900 --> 06:17.260]  Oh.
[06:17.740 --> 06:18.480]  Almost went down.
[06:18.640 --> 06:19.020]  Dick, you fool.
[06:19.160 --> 06:19.780]  Oh, he's alive.
[06:20.940 --> 06:21.300]  Die.
[06:23.180 --> 06:24.720]  Uh, okay, the circle's coming in.
[06:24.740 --> 06:26.180]  We should probably get out of this mine.
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.340]  Uh, if you guys want, like, uh, ranged weapons or anything.
[06:31.260 --> 06:31.440]  Oh.
[06:33.540 --> 06:34.920]  I would like to gather some.
[06:35.020 --> 06:36.960]  Oh, break this shit, grab some stuff.
[06:38.220 --> 06:40.080]  Ooh, get those, get those, get those.
[06:40.160 --> 06:40.660]  Get that crossbow.
[06:40.840 --> 06:41.420]  All right, let's get out of here.
[06:41.860 --> 06:42.460]  Uh, ooh.
[06:42.740 --> 06:43.820]  How do we get out of here?
[06:44.920 --> 06:45.660]  The way we came?
[06:46.500 --> 06:46.860]  Probably.
[06:50.450 --> 06:51.630]  Or we just keep going deeper?
[06:52.730 --> 06:52.850]  Yeah.
[06:54.190 --> 06:55.070]  Has to be a way out.
[06:55.410 --> 06:55.610]  Oh, yeah.
[06:59.270 --> 07:00.830]  Oh, we're just gonna run by these guys?
[07:01.070 --> 07:03.230]  I'm just running. I'm scared about the circle.
[07:03.690 --> 07:03.790]  Oh.
[07:04.910 --> 07:05.130]  All right.
[07:05.190 --> 07:06.870]  Considering we don't know where the exit is.
[07:06.970 --> 07:08.430]  Yeah, I'm just, I'm on, I'm on foot.
[07:08.610 --> 07:09.870]  I'm going, okay, this looks like an exit.
[07:10.010 --> 07:11.510]  Looks like we got more bat things.
[07:12.290 --> 07:12.650]  Fuck them.
[07:14.790 --> 07:15.810]  All right, fucking them.
[07:16.130 --> 07:16.870]  All right, we need to go north.
[07:17.070 --> 07:17.390]  Nice.
[07:18.110 --> 07:18.850]  Nick, don't film it.
[07:18.870 --> 07:19.590]  We'll get taken down.
[07:19.590 --> 07:20.730]  Don't look at Geoff.
[07:21.090 --> 07:22.330]  Don't look at Geoff.
[07:23.110 --> 07:24.170]  No, Geoff, leave them be.
[07:24.830 --> 07:25.650]  I love them.
[07:28.330 --> 07:30.410]  What is it? Sunset at Congress Bridge already?
[07:30.830 --> 07:32.770]  Oh, dude, it's like an orgy.
[07:34.030 --> 07:34.510]  God.
[07:34.930 --> 07:37.570]  Me and 500,000 bats just go into town on each other.
[07:39.210 --> 07:39.690]  Disgusting.
[07:40.090 --> 07:43.070]  I was gonna, I was about to make like a bird noise, but that's, they're bats.
[07:43.310 --> 07:44.470]  Don't, you'll make me cum.
[07:47.490 --> 07:48.690]  Happy Friday, everybody.
[07:49.890 --> 07:50.770]  Oh, what the?
[07:51.250 --> 07:52.530]  Just get him, just get him, just him, just him, just him.
[07:54.190 --> 07:55.830]  Oh, I hit the wrong button.
[07:56.370 --> 07:57.470]  Oh, I need to heal up.
[07:58.070 --> 07:58.650]  Oh, he died.
[07:59.710 --> 07:59.890]  Yeah.
[08:00.010 --> 08:00.330]  Nice job, fellas.
[08:00.470 --> 08:00.810]  Don't do that.
[08:00.930 --> 08:01.050]  Okay.
[08:04.540 --> 08:05.880]  I think they're in us.
[08:06.340 --> 08:07.640]  Oh, another one of those pricks.
[08:08.120 --> 08:08.520]  What's this?
[08:11.080 --> 08:11.800]  Oh, hello.
[08:14.860 --> 08:15.740]  Yeah, I'll take that.
[08:18.940 --> 08:21.400]  I want the crossbow.
[08:21.500 --> 08:21.560]  Yeah.
[08:21.640 --> 08:22.300]  Oh, what are these?
[08:23.080 --> 08:23.720]  Where are we going?
[08:23.780 --> 08:24.400]  Where'd you guys go?
[08:24.480 --> 08:25.420]  I'm surrounded by assholes.
[08:25.500 --> 08:26.040]  Where are you guys?
[08:26.120 --> 08:26.300]  Okay.
[08:26.620 --> 08:27.080]  Right here with you.
[08:27.160 --> 08:28.100]  We're just running around these dudes.
[08:28.140 --> 08:28.640]  We're not fighting them.
[08:29.600 --> 08:30.800]  Uh, I don't know.
[08:31.160 --> 08:31.720]  Worm face.
[08:32.060 --> 08:32.860]  Where'd Andrew go?
[08:33.240 --> 08:35.420]  I'm just adjusting my equipment for a minute.
[08:35.780 --> 08:36.920]  Oh, we should leave, Geoff.
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.840]  Oh, that's a worm face.
[08:38.920 --> 08:40.100]  Classic worm face.
[08:41.060 --> 08:42.340]  Everyone knows worm face.
[08:44.240 --> 08:45.200]  Anybody see a level up?
[08:45.840 --> 08:46.240]  No.
[08:47.120 --> 08:47.440]  Yes.
[08:48.060 --> 08:48.680]  Andrew's on it.
[08:48.940 --> 08:49.620]  I'm on it.
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.220]  Level four now.
[08:53.160 --> 08:53.920]  Watch out, fellas.
[08:54.800 --> 08:55.500]  Level four now.
[08:56.040 --> 08:56.480]  Oh, nice work.
[08:59.920 --> 09:00.700]  Level four now.
[09:01.720 --> 09:02.120]  Nice.
[09:02.280 --> 09:03.000]  I want to get on the fun.
[09:03.520 --> 09:04.440]  Get off me, dickhead.
[09:04.640 --> 09:05.840]  What's going on with this guy?
[09:08.620 --> 09:09.700]  Oh, oh, it's you.
[09:10.400 --> 09:11.280]  It's just us.
[09:11.420 --> 09:11.660]  Oh shit, fire.
[09:12.820 --> 09:13.460]  It's okay.
[09:13.660 --> 09:14.100]  Oh, we're in the circle.
[09:14.260 --> 09:14.500]  You're among friends.
[09:14.600 --> 09:15.040]  We're good.
[09:16.120 --> 09:16.960]  All right.
[09:18.180 --> 09:19.780]  Do we want to try to fight worm face?
[09:19.880 --> 09:21.080]  Are we just going in?
[09:21.280 --> 09:22.060]  What do you think a worm...
[09:22.060 --> 09:23.240]  He's outside the thing.
[09:23.620 --> 09:25.480]  What do you think a warming stone does?
[09:26.540 --> 09:28.220]  Warms your cockles.
[09:28.400 --> 09:30.240]  Probably good for skipping.
[09:34.580 --> 09:36.900]  I don't know if I should save it for the boss.
[09:38.580 --> 09:39.000]  Maybe.
[09:39.200 --> 09:40.160]  Maybe I'm the boss.
[09:40.960 --> 09:42.120]  I hadn't considered that.
[09:42.140 --> 09:43.280]  I keep saying that about you.
[09:43.760 --> 09:44.180]  Yeah.
[09:45.420 --> 09:46.380]  I don't know.
[09:46.560 --> 09:47.620]  Is there any more?
[09:47.820 --> 09:47.980]  Okay.
[09:48.220 --> 09:49.140]  Oh, my wraith calling bells.
[09:49.140 --> 09:50.060]  Wraith calling bells.
[09:51.040 --> 09:51.880]  Oh, that sounds fun.
[09:52.200 --> 09:52.340]  Oh, behind you.
[09:52.400 --> 09:52.820]  Behind you, guys.
[09:52.920 --> 09:53.300]  Behind you, guys.
[09:53.300 --> 09:53.660]  Oh, god.
[09:54.300 --> 09:55.040]  Oh, god.
[09:55.700 --> 09:56.560]  Kill the evil.
[09:56.860 --> 09:57.200]  Jesus.
[09:58.560 --> 10:00.180]  Don't forget to hit them once they're down.
[10:00.760 --> 10:01.140]  Oh, yeah.
[10:01.460 --> 10:01.880]  Yeah.
[10:02.580 --> 10:03.980]  Always hit them while they're down.
[10:06.880 --> 10:09.360]  Somebody should get that wraith clucking bell or whatever.
[10:09.580 --> 10:09.760]  Yeah.
[10:10.220 --> 10:10.660]  I'll get it.
[10:10.800 --> 10:11.240]  Wraith cluck.
[10:11.380 --> 10:11.940]  I got it.
[10:12.440 --> 10:12.940]  You got it?
[10:12.980 --> 10:13.120]  Okay.
[10:15.060 --> 10:16.820]  I guess the gift subs are going nuts.
[10:16.860 --> 10:17.580]  Thanks, everybody.
[10:17.700 --> 10:19.120]  Oh, thank you so much.
[10:19.200 --> 10:21.420]  I'm so sorry that we're not more...
[10:21.420 --> 10:23.100]  Gavin, pay attention to this.
[10:23.620 --> 10:24.520]  Oh, what's this?
[10:24.780 --> 10:25.640]  Oh, this seems good.
[10:26.860 --> 10:27.240]  Yeah.
[10:28.180 --> 10:29.920]  If we had a key, we could do something with that.
[10:30.360 --> 10:30.760]  Oh, okay.
[10:31.000 --> 10:31.180]  Oh.
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.440]  We don't have a stone sword key.
[10:33.820 --> 10:35.020]  We do have an elder line.
[10:35.300 --> 10:35.680]  Oh!
[10:36.440 --> 10:38.640]  Oh, goodness.
[10:39.560 --> 10:40.420]  Yeah, we can get this guy.
[10:40.500 --> 10:41.800]  We're already chunking him so hard.
[10:45.100 --> 10:46.780]  How do you feel about that, dickhead?
[10:46.960 --> 10:47.100]  Chunk!
[10:47.960 --> 10:48.320]  Oh!
[10:48.780 --> 10:49.140]  Oh!
[10:49.280 --> 10:51.020]  Oh, this is a beatdown!
[10:52.960 --> 10:53.680]  Oh, damn!
[10:54.260 --> 10:54.480]  Ow!
[10:56.840 --> 10:58.160]  He's still a little dangerous.
[11:02.140 --> 11:02.500]  Okay.
[11:02.840 --> 11:04.380]  He really hurts when he hits you.
[11:05.680 --> 11:06.740]  Oh, I'm gonna drink up.
[11:07.520 --> 11:08.280]  Yeah, everybody drink up.
[11:08.460 --> 11:08.520]  He's so low.
[11:08.600 --> 11:08.900]  He's so low.
[11:08.980 --> 11:09.200]  We got him.
[11:09.340 --> 11:09.500]  We got him.
[11:09.600 --> 11:09.760]  We got him.
[11:09.860 --> 11:10.360]  Here's your hoe.
[11:10.440 --> 11:10.780]  He's dead.
[11:11.880 --> 11:12.220]  Woo!
[11:12.580 --> 11:13.860]  Thank you so much, Brett.
[11:14.300 --> 11:14.940]  Take that.
[11:15.160 --> 11:16.000]  Yeah, thanks, Brett.
[11:17.140 --> 11:18.060]  We appreciate it.
[11:18.340 --> 11:23.620]  It's because of you we were able to defeat the lion lord, whatever the fuck he was.
[11:24.640 --> 11:25.780]  All right, we got more bats.
[11:27.860 --> 11:28.740]  Uh, where should we go?
[11:29.420 --> 11:30.460]  Look for a level up station.
[11:30.540 --> 11:30.960]  What's the map say?
[11:31.100 --> 11:32.020]  Oh, there's a level up right over here.
[11:33.280 --> 11:33.820]  Oh, so yeah.
[11:34.200 --> 11:34.780]  That's good.
[11:34.860 --> 11:35.240]  Oh, that's right.
[11:37.540 --> 11:38.580]  Yeah, I'm level five now.
[11:38.820 --> 11:39.340]  All right, five.
[11:41.480 --> 11:43.080]  Uh, looks like we need to go the other way.
[11:43.180 --> 11:43.740]  We need to go this way.
[11:44.360 --> 11:47.020]  Let's keep killing these bat things.
[11:49.120 --> 11:50.560]  Oh, he already, he's dead.
[11:50.820 --> 11:52.640]  Wow, dude, you put it to him.
[11:54.140 --> 11:54.740]  Damn!
[11:55.200 --> 11:56.280]  You boys are dangerous.
[11:57.960 --> 11:58.860]  We've learned.
[11:59.380 --> 12:03.740]  We have come so far from our first run.
[12:06.760 --> 12:08.840]  This looks like a little house village place.
[12:11.640 --> 12:13.500]  Let's make it another death village.
[12:15.400 --> 12:16.580]  Ah, dog!
[12:16.760 --> 12:18.260]  He's, he's, I got him, I got him.
[12:18.300 --> 12:19.100]  He's a little bitch.
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.160]  Oh, oh, oh, shaggy dog, shaggy dog.
[12:24.160 --> 12:24.600]  Shaggy dog?
[12:25.240 --> 12:26.840]  Tim Allen's all over me.
[12:28.720 --> 12:30.000]  I got him, I got him.
[12:30.020 --> 12:30.680]  Tim Allen's down.
[12:32.920 --> 12:33.720]  Oh, this dickhead.
[12:38.780 --> 12:40.820]  We do so much.
[12:44.160 --> 12:45.200]  Oh, damn.
[12:45.660 --> 12:48.720]  You two kept hitting him so far back, I couldn't get in.
[12:48.980 --> 12:51.560]  I'd swing and then he'd be five feet back.
[12:52.280 --> 12:52.800]  Oh.
[12:55.240 --> 12:56.140]  Another guy.
[12:57.600 --> 12:58.120]  Uh.
[12:59.440 --> 13:00.940]  All right, bigger shield.
[13:02.500 --> 13:03.020]  Anything good?
[13:04.260 --> 13:05.460]  Uh, some fire grease.
[13:06.620 --> 13:07.980]  I have two fire pots already, sweet.
[13:08.120 --> 13:08.560]  Ah, dog!
[13:09.720 --> 13:10.240]  Shaggy dog.
[13:10.440 --> 13:11.620]  Oh, Tim Allen's back!
[13:13.740 --> 13:15.100]  No rest for Timmy.
[13:15.980 --> 13:19.160]  Is that, is the shaggy dog on that wheel, Andrew?
[13:19.540 --> 13:20.500]  Oh, it should be.
[13:20.940 --> 13:21.680]  It definitely should be.
[13:21.680 --> 13:22.620]  It's getting on the wheel.
[13:23.020 --> 13:24.300]  That's such a great call.
[13:25.140 --> 13:25.940]  Erdtree has appeared.
[13:26.220 --> 13:26.520]  Let's go.
[13:27.140 --> 13:30.140]  If the audience wants to know what that wheel is, we're talking about too bad.
[13:30.460 --> 13:31.180]  You'll have to wait.
[13:31.940 --> 13:33.500]  That's what they call a spoiler.
[13:33.840 --> 13:34.460]  Oh, ow.
[13:34.860 --> 13:35.640]  A tease.
[13:38.120 --> 13:38.560]  Whoops.
[13:40.900 --> 13:42.240]  Okay, up and over, Geoff.
[13:42.560 --> 13:43.660]  Why would you even fight us?
[13:47.080 --> 13:48.680]  Uh, we're gonna have to hit the jumps.
[13:49.660 --> 13:50.200]  Oh, shit.
[13:50.300 --> 13:50.480]  Okay.
[13:51.220 --> 13:51.580]  Over.
[13:52.300 --> 13:54.660]  Let's, uh, go to that level up thing before we...
[13:54.660 --> 13:55.900]  Yeah, let's level up a tad.
[13:56.820 --> 13:57.540]  If we can.
[13:57.920 --> 13:58.580]  If we can.
[14:00.260 --> 14:01.180]  And then hit the jump.
[14:01.520 --> 14:02.420]  I think it's right here, right?
[14:02.580 --> 14:02.760]  Yeah.
[14:02.780 --> 14:03.080]  Let's see.
[14:03.900 --> 14:04.260]  Six.
[14:04.260 --> 14:04.780]  Spirit stream.
[14:05.180 --> 14:05.540]  Woohoo!
[14:05.860 --> 14:06.140]  Level six.
[14:09.200 --> 14:10.400]  What the hell is this?
[14:10.780 --> 14:11.260]  Oh, it's a statue.
[14:11.300 --> 14:11.820]  It's a statue.
[14:15.740 --> 14:16.900]  I want to attack it.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.140]  Uh, let's see.
[14:19.760 --> 14:20.540]  I guess we need to go up here.
[14:20.540 --> 14:22.160]  It's definitely a breakable statue.
[14:23.080 --> 14:25.080]  Does anyone want to throw a fire pot at it if they have one?
[14:26.780 --> 14:27.980]  I have a warming stone.
[14:28.180 --> 14:28.380]  Uh, sure.
[14:28.900 --> 14:29.280]  I have a...
[14:29.280 --> 14:29.880]  Just to see.
[14:30.240 --> 14:31.860]  Like, it's so clearly supposed to be...
[14:34.220 --> 14:34.940]  Okay, well.
[14:35.000 --> 14:35.620]  Nice throw.
[14:36.020 --> 14:37.820]  I mean, doing it from the side is a...
[14:37.820 --> 14:38.000]  Okay.
[14:38.900 --> 14:39.840]  It's not that.
[14:40.320 --> 14:41.280]  So we know it's not a fire pot.
[14:44.960 --> 14:45.440]  Oh, enemies.
[14:51.040 --> 14:51.960]  All right.
[14:52.180 --> 14:53.460]  You guys are killing them before they get there.
[14:54.040 --> 14:54.480]  Yeah, right?
[14:58.680 --> 14:59.140]  I'm...
[14:59.140 --> 15:00.300]  And we gotta keep going.
[15:00.460 --> 15:03.840]  Oh, we should grab this summon foe chasing deal.
[15:04.240 --> 15:04.560]  Oh, yeah.
[15:04.580 --> 15:05.260]  I love this guy.
[15:05.700 --> 15:06.360]  He's the best.
[15:07.600 --> 15:08.260]  He's fantastic.
[15:08.840 --> 15:09.360]  Oh, what's this?
[15:09.880 --> 15:11.060]  Beast lure pot.
[15:11.960 --> 15:12.280]  Take it.
[15:12.660 --> 15:13.760]  We should start moving.
[15:13.860 --> 15:14.200]  Now I have a room.
[15:16.340 --> 15:17.060]  Where are we going?
[15:17.440 --> 15:18.360]  Gonna go up the hill.
[15:18.880 --> 15:19.940]  Oh, we gotta go that way then.
[15:25.550 --> 15:25.910]  Okay.
[15:27.990 --> 15:29.990]  Andrew's leaving a wake of enemies behind him.
[15:30.630 --> 15:32.250]  I'm just trying to get us to that circle.
[15:32.390 --> 15:32.850]  Oh, the...
[15:33.170 --> 15:34.530]  Oh, the glowy thing.
[15:34.710 --> 15:34.810]  Oh, shit.
[15:35.530 --> 15:36.290]  Go, run!
[15:38.290 --> 15:38.650]  Woohoo!
[15:38.750 --> 15:39.210]  Here comes the fire!
[15:39.250 --> 15:39.970]  It's on me too!
[15:40.250 --> 15:40.370]  Here comes the fire, Andrew!
[15:41.310 --> 15:41.850]  Run, Andrew!
[15:42.030 --> 15:42.470]  I'm running!
[15:44.290 --> 15:45.110]  All right, we made it.
[15:46.230 --> 15:46.870]  Heal ailments?
[15:47.010 --> 15:47.510]  What the hell is that?
[15:47.590 --> 15:47.850]  Oh, okay.
[15:48.330 --> 15:49.090]  It's where we fight the boss.
[15:51.350 --> 15:51.990]  What do we got?
[15:52.110 --> 15:52.590]  What do we got?
[15:52.630 --> 15:53.010]  What do we got?
[15:53.010 --> 15:53.530]  What do we got?
[15:53.710 --> 15:54.150]  Who wants to die?
[15:54.150 --> 15:54.770]  We got little dudes first.
[15:56.310 --> 15:57.230]  Get the little fellas.
[16:00.130 --> 16:00.990]  How do you like that?
[16:01.590 --> 16:01.910]  Ouch!
[16:09.120 --> 16:09.760]  You're dicks.
[16:10.000 --> 16:10.180]  Prick.
[16:11.080 --> 16:11.260]  Ow.
[16:11.920 --> 16:12.620]  Oh, we're all the way.
[16:12.720 --> 16:13.020]  We're all the way.
[16:18.020 --> 16:18.340]  Oh!
[16:20.460 --> 16:21.380]  Is he dead?
[16:21.540 --> 16:22.180]  No, he's not.
[16:22.400 --> 16:22.640]  Shit.
[16:22.640 --> 16:23.040]  Oh, he's alive.
[16:23.800 --> 16:24.680]  Looked like he died.
[16:25.060 --> 16:25.140]  Ow!
[16:26.520 --> 16:27.080]  Ow.
[16:27.300 --> 16:29.000]  Which one's shield and which one's parry?
[16:30.720 --> 16:31.840]  I think...
[16:31.840 --> 16:32.680]  Bumpers.
[16:32.700 --> 16:33.060]  We got him.
[16:33.140 --> 16:33.540]  Parry.
[16:33.940 --> 16:34.360]  Nice.
[16:34.880 --> 16:35.840]  Get ready for the bosses.
[16:37.400 --> 16:39.100]  Oh, these little pricks.
[16:40.040 --> 16:41.480]  Probably a mistake.
[16:46.640 --> 16:48.160]  I'm summoning an ally.
[16:49.680 --> 16:50.280]  Do it.
[16:50.560 --> 16:51.920]  Do you say ally or owl-eye?
[16:52.420 --> 16:53.460]  Either one would be cool.
[16:54.660 --> 16:55.280]  A friend.
[16:56.720 --> 16:57.300]  That's also cool.
[16:57.300 --> 16:58.300]  At least I think I am.
[16:58.680 --> 16:59.040]  Ow!
[16:59.160 --> 17:00.060]  Little son of a bitch.
[17:00.100 --> 17:00.560]  I think I did.
[17:00.960 --> 17:01.320]  Ow!
[17:02.860 --> 17:03.220]  Shit.
[17:06.940 --> 17:07.300]  Realtor.
[17:07.440 --> 17:08.400]  What the hell is the button?
[17:10.920 --> 17:11.680]  Shield did nothing.
[17:12.500 --> 17:12.640]  Oh!
[17:12.960 --> 17:14.340]  Pull out the sword, son of a zombie.
[17:14.720 --> 17:15.280]  I'm in a bad land.
[17:15.280 --> 17:16.060]  Pull out the sword.
[17:17.680 --> 17:18.300]  I'm down.
[17:19.900 --> 17:21.360]  Down at his feet, right next to you, Nick.
[17:22.480 --> 17:23.140]  Thank you.
[17:23.480 --> 17:25.800]  I'm getting my fucking asshole ripped up.
[17:25.920 --> 17:26.500]  There you go.
[17:26.560 --> 17:26.860]  Run away.
[17:27.100 --> 17:27.780]  Oh, my asshole.
[17:27.880 --> 17:28.240]  It hurts.
[17:28.380 --> 17:29.300]  It's so ripped up.
[17:29.840 --> 17:32.980]  Yeah, so the way to summon people who are down is to hit the shit out of them.
[17:33.200 --> 17:33.460]  Yeah.
[17:33.880 --> 17:34.540]  Which is great.
[17:36.680 --> 17:39.580]  I like that it doesn't take the focus away from what you want to do.
[17:40.600 --> 17:43.040]  It's like, we don't want you to stop killing at any point.
[17:43.140 --> 17:44.560]  So kill your friends back to life.
[17:46.680 --> 17:47.160]  Oh, you little...
[17:48.460 --> 17:49.440]  Oh, he dodged me.
[17:54.650 --> 17:56.570]  Oh, he's fucking friends.
[17:57.270 --> 17:58.530]  What the hell does this thing do?
[18:00.950 --> 18:01.830]  Oh, sweet.
[18:04.030 --> 18:05.090]  Oh, they're chasing me.
[18:05.130 --> 18:05.650]  They're chasing me.
[18:05.730 --> 18:06.270]  They're chasing me.
[18:08.530 --> 18:09.130]  This for you?
[18:09.290 --> 18:10.090]  Oh, run away.
[18:13.620 --> 18:14.460]  Oh, no.
[18:15.380 --> 18:16.080]  Oh, boy.
[18:18.240 --> 18:19.000]  Woo-hoo!
[18:19.500 --> 18:21.660]  Make a little love.
[18:22.200 --> 18:23.060]  Go down tonight.
[18:23.240 --> 18:23.700]  I'm gonna go down.
[18:23.700 --> 18:23.980]  Oh, no.
[18:23.980 --> 18:24.460]  I'm gonna go down.
[18:24.560 --> 18:25.100]  I don't wanna go down.
[18:26.780 --> 18:27.880]  Don't know what it does.
[18:27.940 --> 18:28.340]  Just take him.
[18:28.460 --> 18:28.740]  Eat him.
[18:30.200 --> 18:30.760]  Oh, no.
[18:32.060 --> 18:33.000]  Okay, pops of fire grease.
[18:35.200 --> 18:35.700]  I'm down.
[18:37.140 --> 18:37.880]  I'm coming for you.
[18:41.500 --> 18:44.740]  I'm so down.
[18:44.960 --> 18:45.920]  Little bastards.
[18:46.580 --> 18:47.400]  I'm getting fucked.
[18:47.760 --> 18:48.240]  I'm getting fucked.
[18:50.420 --> 18:51.520]  Once you get...
[18:51.520 --> 18:52.520]  Come on, turn.
[18:54.780 --> 18:55.140]  Shit.
[18:56.620 --> 18:56.980]  Shit.
[18:58.320 --> 18:58.940]  Fuck me.
[19:00.040 --> 19:00.660]  Got you, Geoff.
[19:01.500 --> 19:02.560]  Ah, Nick's down.
[19:05.420 --> 19:06.140]  Oh, what?
[19:06.560 --> 19:07.280]  I thought Geoff was up.
[19:07.400 --> 19:08.080]  No, I never got up.
[19:10.040 --> 19:11.920]  Oh, didn't help that I missed you like twice.
[19:12.760 --> 19:13.340]  It's hard.
[19:13.740 --> 19:14.300]  It's a good run.
[19:15.100 --> 19:15.880]  That's a great run.
[19:15.960 --> 19:17.800]  I don't know that anybody's done better than that at that point.
[19:17.800 --> 19:18.460]  No, I don't think so.
[19:18.640 --> 19:20.620]  I don't think anyone's ever seen day two, including us.
[19:22.080 --> 19:23.700]  There's no video evidence to prove it.
[19:24.580 --> 19:25.960]  No, it's not out yet.
[19:26.000 --> 19:26.800]  It's been released.
[19:27.040 --> 19:29.280]  I feel pretty good about that.
[19:29.360 --> 19:31.520]  How do we improve our characters?
[19:33.000 --> 19:33.960]  I think...
[19:34.460 --> 19:35.700]  Relic rites, I guess.
[19:36.040 --> 19:36.660]  Relic stuff.
[19:38.420 --> 19:39.780]  I don't have any blues.
[19:43.760 --> 19:46.740]  Attack powers are fundamentalist incantations.
[19:47.460 --> 19:49.020]  Let's throw this on for now.
[19:50.260 --> 19:51.880]  Do I want to be one of these other characters?
[19:52.060 --> 19:53.120]  Go buy a...
[19:56.420 --> 19:57.060]  ...different runes.
[19:57.160 --> 20:00.040]  I'm going to explore a little bit to see if there's anything else that's like,
[20:00.080 --> 20:00.940]  hey, you can buy this.
[20:02.800 --> 20:04.340]  Oh, yeah, Geoff said that you can buy stuff.
[20:04.440 --> 20:06.280]  I'm not the guy that you buy stuff from right now.
[20:06.580 --> 20:07.180]  Where is he?
[20:07.940 --> 20:10.540]  Just click on hit back and then go to bazaar.
[20:10.820 --> 20:11.620]  You can get it that way.
[20:16.700 --> 20:17.580]  Yes, the bazaar.
[20:17.660 --> 20:19.160]  Oh, small jar bazaar.
[20:20.660 --> 20:21.340]  I'm sorry, what?
[20:21.440 --> 20:22.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.060]  Small jar bazaar.
[20:23.640 --> 20:23.880]  Okay.
[20:25.520 --> 20:27.120]  Found a sparring grounds.
[20:27.220 --> 20:31.000]  I'm hoping this is sparring stuff.
[20:32.060 --> 20:34.640]  Figured if you could buy like a new weapon or something,
[20:34.740 --> 20:36.220]  it would be in the sparring grounds.
[20:36.700 --> 20:37.020]  Right.
[20:37.420 --> 20:39.580]  Did I say I need blue or green?
[20:39.620 --> 20:40.060]  I need blue.
[20:44.120 --> 20:46.160]  A lot of people asking for regulation baseball jersey.
[20:48.480 --> 20:49.320]  All right, I'll do that.
[20:49.720 --> 20:50.140]  There we go.
[20:50.440 --> 20:51.040]  We're not.
[20:51.680 --> 20:53.960]  We're not playing milf mod just yet.
[20:54.620 --> 20:55.560]  We're working on it.
[20:55.720 --> 20:57.580]  JLSMSP, we're waiting for that to get patched in.
[20:58.140 --> 20:59.660]  Yeah, we are working on it.
[21:00.040 --> 21:00.600]  We recorded.
[21:00.880 --> 21:03.600]  I don't know if the milf toolkit has been released yet.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.020]  No, we're still waiting on it.
[21:06.240 --> 21:07.880]  Yeah, we recorded new trucks today.
[21:09.200 --> 21:09.600]  Roadcraft.
[21:10.820 --> 21:13.320]  And I got to say, I liked it more than I thought I would.
[21:14.780 --> 21:16.900]  It definitely is improved by playing with people.
[21:17.920 --> 21:18.420]  I think so.
[21:19.440 --> 21:21.380]  Oh, I'm so close to buying a random thing.
[21:22.280 --> 21:24.660]  This is oddly peaceful for a stressful game.
[21:25.840 --> 21:27.980]  Maybe it's just the crew that's here.
[21:28.100 --> 21:28.940]  You say you're close to buying?
[21:29.080 --> 21:30.240]  What are you close to buying, Andrew?
[21:30.280 --> 21:32.640]  One of those, like, give you a random relic things.
[21:33.280 --> 21:34.620]  Oh, the $600 one?
[21:34.780 --> 21:35.160]  Yeah.
[21:35.580 --> 21:36.720]  Yeah, I bought one of those earlier.
[21:36.800 --> 21:37.200]  It was cool.
[21:38.100 --> 21:40.440]  Yeah, I felt like I got a better one from that.
[21:40.680 --> 21:42.960]  And then I got two that he already sells.
[21:43.860 --> 21:44.540]  Let me see.
[21:45.160 --> 21:46.800]  See if I can buy one.
[21:47.280 --> 21:48.260]  Oh, I can.
[21:48.260 --> 21:54.270]  I got a delicate, tranquil scene.
[21:55.810 --> 21:59.750]  It's the same as the other one.
[22:00.150 --> 22:03.910]  I got a guy painting out here.
[22:06.590 --> 22:08.950]  Can we pick a different expedition?
[22:09.350 --> 22:10.330]  Doesn't seem like it.
[22:10.430 --> 22:10.670]  You should be able to.
[22:11.190 --> 22:11.570]  Oh, okay.
[22:12.190 --> 22:13.170]  Then maybe not.
[22:13.550 --> 22:17.210]  It's just this Tricephalos seems to be the only one that we have access to.
[22:18.210 --> 22:21.290]  I guess maybe we have to beat the boss at some point.
[22:21.370 --> 22:22.130]  We have to reach it.
[22:22.710 --> 22:23.190]  Maybe.
[22:23.910 --> 22:25.490]  It's an expansive garden out here.
[22:26.770 --> 22:27.850]  A lot of shit.
[22:28.470 --> 22:30.970]  Don't forget, we got to commence the expedition to go back.
[22:32.810 --> 22:33.630]  That is true.
[22:33.770 --> 22:34.950]  I'm sorry, what did you say, Nick?
[22:35.570 --> 22:35.930]  What?
[22:36.170 --> 22:36.570]  What did you say?
[22:36.610 --> 22:39.470]  I said we got to commence the expedition to go fight.
[22:40.170 --> 22:42.210]  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[22:42.410 --> 22:43.710]  Going back to commence.
[22:44.650 --> 22:46.530]  No sausage talk on stream today?
[22:46.530 --> 22:52.590]  No, we released the sausage talk on the Patreon and YouTube and podcast app.
[22:53.110 --> 22:55.350]  Yeah, we produced the sausage.
[22:55.490 --> 22:57.350]  They could grill it up whenever they want.
[22:57.810 --> 23:00.670]  I can see, yeah, grill it up whenever you want to.
[23:00.770 --> 23:02.510]  But that sausage is ready for you right now.
[23:02.690 --> 23:07.390]  I think maybe the confusion was they were, it was on the same, it looked,
[23:08.290 --> 23:10.830]  we could have put a comma there on the schedule.
[23:11.690 --> 23:15.490]  Because it said like regulation sausage talk stream 4pm.
[23:15.490 --> 23:17.010]  Oh, I see.
[23:17.010 --> 23:19.390]  I think some people might have thought we were going to have a sausage talk on stream,
[23:19.450 --> 23:21.430]  not release a recorded sausage talk.
[23:21.830 --> 23:22.110]  I see.
[23:22.110 --> 23:22.910]  I'll talk about sausage.
[23:24.210 --> 23:25.030]  I like sausage.
[23:25.530 --> 23:29.990]  I thought about it in the moment and then I didn't bother following up on it.
[23:30.690 --> 23:32.270]  When was the last time you had chorizo?
[23:33.270 --> 23:34.570]  I had like a couple days ago.
[23:35.090 --> 23:35.870]  Maybe two weeks.
[23:35.910 --> 23:36.650]  Had me too, actually.
[23:37.530 --> 23:40.170]  I get a chorizo egg and cheese tacos fairly regularly.
[23:40.790 --> 23:41.730]  Oh, they're good, dude.
[23:42.510 --> 23:44.830]  If you get ones that aren't too greasy, they're excellent.
[23:44.830 --> 23:47.250]  If you get some that are too greasy, they're also excellent.
[23:49.050 --> 23:50.490]  Well, I can't argue with you there.
[23:50.490 --> 23:51.570]  Different kind of, different kind of excellent.
[23:52.130 --> 23:53.230]  Yeah, different kind of excellent.
[23:54.130 --> 23:55.410]  Hey, birds, fuck the battlefield.
[23:55.570 --> 23:56.530]  Let's get some chorizo.
[23:57.050 --> 23:59.330]  Take us to the nearest chorizo drop.
[24:01.990 --> 24:04.810]  I'll have my regulation sausage with biscuits and gravy, please.
[24:05.430 --> 24:05.970]  That's your right.
[24:06.790 --> 24:08.490]  Oh, thank you so much, Atomic Bomb.
[24:09.190 --> 24:09.650]  Five subs.
[24:09.670 --> 24:11.390]  You dropped an atomic sub bomb.
[24:11.550 --> 24:12.110]  What were you going to say, Nick?
[24:12.110 --> 24:15.630]  I was going to say I had chorizo with shrimp and a taco.
[24:16.070 --> 24:17.530]  Oh, how was that?
[24:17.970 --> 24:18.830]  It was good.
[24:19.290 --> 24:20.950]  That seems like flavors complemented each other pretty well.
[24:21.070 --> 24:22.370]  Okay, you say so.
[24:22.530 --> 24:24.350]  I think we're going into chorizo canyon, guys.
[24:24.430 --> 24:24.870]  Get ready, guys.
[24:25.730 --> 24:26.210]  Chorizo canyon.
[24:26.210 --> 24:27.590]  It does look like we're dropping into chorizo canyon.
[24:28.510 --> 24:29.570]  We should go to the manor over there.
[24:29.690 --> 24:30.610]  Sure, let's do it.
[24:33.930 --> 24:35.610]  Oh, we got enemies right off the gate.
[24:38.270 --> 24:38.990]  Oh, hello.
[24:40.230 --> 24:40.590]  Silence.
[24:42.610 --> 24:43.850]  Oh, no, you don't.
[24:43.950 --> 24:44.530]  Oh, what the?
[24:45.490 --> 24:45.830]  Ow.
[24:49.110 --> 24:49.470]  Death.
[24:51.930 --> 24:52.470]  Now what?
[24:52.550 --> 24:52.910]  Where are we going?
[24:53.270 --> 24:53.930]  What's the thing we're doing?
[24:54.190 --> 24:55.270]  Going up to the manor.
[24:55.370 --> 24:57.830]  There's a little level up spot.
[24:58.310 --> 24:59.030]  You little prick.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.060]  Oh, yeah, we've been here before.
[25:04.760 --> 25:05.920]  God, it's just so...
[25:08.220 --> 25:11.300]  We should figure out how to do this stuff at the bottom of our screen,
[25:11.400 --> 25:12.440]  because it feels like a super.
[25:12.940 --> 25:13.740]  It's charging.
[25:14.200 --> 25:14.340]  I think it is.
[25:14.460 --> 25:15.480]  I think if you like hold...
[25:16.220 --> 25:16.620]  What is it?
[25:17.040 --> 25:19.000]  It's Y and right trigger or...
[25:20.380 --> 25:22.800]  And then I think Y and left trigger, depending.
[25:23.040 --> 25:23.920]  I think you're right.
[25:24.120 --> 25:26.400]  I think hold Y and then right trigger, I think.
[25:27.660 --> 25:28.540]  I think you're right.
[25:28.760 --> 25:29.340]  Let me see.
[25:30.000 --> 25:30.480]  Pick that.
[25:31.060 --> 25:32.880]  Yeah, yeah, that did it.
[25:34.100 --> 25:35.680]  Okay, I've been using that on bosses.
[25:36.080 --> 25:36.940]  It's very helpful.
[25:37.660 --> 25:38.100]  Okay.
[25:40.300 --> 25:41.900]  Oh, right, you didn't play the tutorial.
[25:41.900 --> 25:42.580]  Sorry, Andrew.
[25:42.760 --> 25:43.640]  That's all good.
[25:46.720 --> 25:47.760]  You guys fighting stuff?
[25:48.120 --> 25:48.720]  Oh, yeah.
[25:48.800 --> 25:50.540]  Yeah, we got a bunch of people in this town.
[25:50.660 --> 25:52.040]  Oh, I just realized how hurt I am.
[25:52.160 --> 25:52.960]  I need to heal up.
[25:54.740 --> 25:56.160]  I'm sure chat was yelling at me.
[25:56.480 --> 25:57.380]  Oh, sorry, chat.
[25:58.680 --> 25:59.400]  Nice kill.
[26:00.960 --> 26:03.540]  Oh, dog, not shaggy, just small.
[26:04.540 --> 26:05.180]  He looks shaggy.
[26:05.920 --> 26:07.340]  Yeah, yeah, he does.
[26:07.640 --> 26:08.340]  Yeah, you're right.
[26:09.400 --> 26:09.960]  You're right.
[26:10.240 --> 26:10.880]  Bad call by me.
[26:10.880 --> 26:13.300]  Oh, another shaggy dog.
[26:13.400 --> 26:14.440]  Yeah, shaggy dog.
[26:15.040 --> 26:15.800]  Grab all that crap.
[26:17.020 --> 26:17.760]  Never know when the...
[26:17.760 --> 26:18.400]  Oh, fire pot.
[26:19.840 --> 26:20.160]  Replace.
[26:20.280 --> 26:20.900]  Oh, no, witches.
[26:21.560 --> 26:22.220]  Oh, Lord.
[26:22.420 --> 26:23.140]  What are these?
[26:23.460 --> 26:24.120]  Never mind, they're dead.
[26:24.160 --> 26:24.540]  I got them.
[26:28.020 --> 26:28.660]  I'm also...
[26:28.660 --> 26:31.080]  Oh, I just turned a corner and suddenly I was fucking assaulted.
[26:31.240 --> 26:31.600]  Yeah, there you go.
[26:31.620 --> 26:32.340]  You see what I'm talking about?
[26:32.560 --> 26:33.740]  Oh, well, chat's over here.
[26:33.820 --> 26:34.320]  Before we even got here.
[26:35.560 --> 26:36.720]  Oh, nice.
[26:36.840 --> 26:37.940]  That's a nice little sword, huh?
[26:38.620 --> 26:39.400]  Anybody want to snag it?
[26:39.680 --> 26:40.640]  You can get it if you want.
[26:40.880 --> 26:41.440]  It's all you.
[26:41.980 --> 26:42.640]  Yeah, go for it.
[26:42.640 --> 26:42.780]  I got it.
[26:43.100 --> 26:43.480]  Thank you.
[26:43.640 --> 26:44.080]  You would.
[26:45.000 --> 26:45.660]  Oh, what is...
[26:48.040 --> 26:48.760]  All right.
[26:51.240 --> 26:52.000]  Let's level up.
[26:52.660 --> 26:55.340]  I want to see what's going on in this hole.
[26:55.940 --> 26:56.860]  But I want to level up first.
[26:56.920 --> 26:58.500]  Oh, I fell in.
[26:58.760 --> 27:00.220]  OK, well, I'm going to go check out the hole.
[27:01.220 --> 27:02.440]  Yeah, it looks like we're checking out the hole.
[27:04.660 --> 27:05.900]  Oh, it's like a trap.
[27:06.100 --> 27:06.860]  Andrew went right past that.
[27:06.860 --> 27:07.900]  Take a sacred seal.
[27:08.000 --> 27:08.660]  What is this?
[27:09.260 --> 27:10.040]  Ballmark seal?
[27:10.400 --> 27:10.860]  Finger seal.
[27:11.860 --> 27:12.680]  Ballmark seal.
[27:12.800 --> 27:13.040]  I guess I'll take that.
[27:13.060 --> 27:13.620]  It was a trap.
[27:13.720 --> 27:13.960]  You can take it.
[27:14.340 --> 27:14.820]  Sure.
[27:16.440 --> 27:19.180]  Get this sorcery out of the air.
[27:19.560 --> 27:20.080]  I'm on fire.
[27:20.740 --> 27:22.320]  Oh, what is this?
[27:22.420 --> 27:22.960]  Thanks, Nick.
[27:23.460 --> 27:24.120]  You're welcome.
[27:24.960 --> 27:25.580]  Minimum level three.
[27:25.580 --> 27:26.020]  What'd you find, Geoff?
[27:26.420 --> 27:26.920]  Uh, some...
[27:28.060 --> 27:29.080]  Oh, a warming stone.
[27:29.160 --> 27:29.860]  Get that warming stone.
[27:29.860 --> 27:31.100]  It usually heals nearby alley...
[27:31.100 --> 27:31.840]  Alleys.
[27:32.000 --> 27:32.140]  Yep.
[27:33.320 --> 27:34.060]  Fucking idiot.
[27:37.940 --> 27:39.370]  That wasn't much of a...
[27:40.540 --> 27:42.760]  There's no loathing better than self-loathing.
[27:43.040 --> 27:45.740]  Yeah, especially when it's deserved.
[27:47.680 --> 27:48.200]  All right.
[27:48.320 --> 27:50.120]  I just fucking hate you, me.
[27:51.480 --> 27:53.340]  How could me do this, me?
[27:53.420 --> 27:53.960]  What's going on over here?
[27:55.800 --> 27:56.760]  I found a boss.
[27:56.920 --> 27:57.700]  I found a boss.
[27:58.140 --> 27:58.760]  Oh, shit.
[27:58.780 --> 27:59.160]  Where are you?
[27:59.240 --> 27:59.620]  Go back.
[27:59.740 --> 28:00.600]  Go back to the hole.
[28:02.340 --> 28:03.080]  Inside the hole?
[28:04.100 --> 28:04.420]  Yep.
[28:04.940 --> 28:05.960]  You're in the hole still?
[28:06.380 --> 28:07.140]  Yeah, I went back.
[28:07.260 --> 28:09.000]  I was like, surely there has to be more to this.
[28:09.020 --> 28:09.920]  I think we went the wrong way.
[28:12.420 --> 28:14.340]  By the time we get there, this fight will be done.
[28:14.360 --> 28:14.940]  No, I see it.
[28:15.100 --> 28:15.160]  No.
[28:19.160 --> 28:20.120]  Oh, I'm down.
[28:20.860 --> 28:21.380]  Oh, shit.
[28:21.880 --> 28:22.480]  That's bad.
[28:24.800 --> 28:25.900]  I'll fuck this dude up, Nick.
[28:25.960 --> 28:26.680]  You get Andrew.
[28:27.360 --> 28:27.600]  Got him.
[28:27.700 --> 28:27.900]  Got me.
[28:27.980 --> 28:28.580]  Thank you, Nick.
[28:30.020 --> 28:31.200]  I need to roll away.
[28:31.520 --> 28:31.900]  We got him.
[28:31.980 --> 28:32.520]  Firemonk down.
[28:33.880 --> 28:34.320]  Ooh.
[28:38.180 --> 28:39.060]  Uh, yes.
[28:40.180 --> 28:42.240]  Yeah, we'll take it over the hook claws.
[28:42.520 --> 28:43.200]  That sword.
[28:43.420 --> 28:44.080]  All right, sweet.
[28:44.460 --> 28:46.200]  Yeah, I got a nice sword.
[28:46.620 --> 28:48.260]  All right, we should probably get going.
[28:49.200 --> 28:49.640]  Yeah.
[28:49.700 --> 28:50.800]  Ooh, level up right here.
[28:51.600 --> 28:51.980]  Nice.
[28:52.180 --> 28:52.620]  All right, three.
[28:54.780 --> 28:57.640]  It's cool that they seem to always put it right after a boss fight.
[28:58.040 --> 28:58.200]  Yeah.
[28:58.280 --> 28:58.540]  Yeah.
[28:59.260 --> 29:00.140]  You going that way, Nick?
[29:00.500 --> 29:01.120]  I think so.
[29:02.700 --> 29:03.740]  Let's take a look at the map.
[29:03.860 --> 29:05.500]  All right, we got to move a little bit northwest.
[29:07.500 --> 29:07.760]  Okay.
[29:10.940 --> 29:11.740]  What's that thing?
[29:12.260 --> 29:12.660]  What thing?
[29:13.400 --> 29:14.160]  Dude on horseback.
[29:14.420 --> 29:15.280]  I don't see it.
[29:16.120 --> 29:16.740]  To your right, Geoff.
[29:16.800 --> 29:17.320]  Oh, I see him.
[29:17.820 --> 29:19.100]  He doesn't look friendly.
[29:21.300 --> 29:22.280]  He's not friendly.
[29:22.720 --> 29:24.300]  Well, he's definitely flammable.
[29:24.440 --> 29:25.060]  I'll tell you that.
[29:26.500 --> 29:27.140]  I'm away.
[29:27.760 --> 29:31.100]  Oh, I hate that we had to kill the horse to get to the horse.
[29:31.100 --> 29:31.760]  To get to the man.
[29:32.520 --> 29:34.420]  But, you know, that horse made his decision.
[29:35.140 --> 29:36.180]  It knew who he was working with.
[29:36.280 --> 29:36.820]  He made his choice.
[29:37.040 --> 29:37.560]  That's a definite war horse.
[29:39.180 --> 29:39.540]  Was.
[29:40.200 --> 29:41.400]  Was a definite war horse.
[29:42.620 --> 29:44.920]  It was a good dodge by this little dude.
[29:45.760 --> 29:47.220]  I think we were here last time, weren't we?
[29:47.880 --> 29:48.500]  I don't know.
[29:48.600 --> 29:49.280]  Ooh, what's this?
[29:50.840 --> 29:53.800]  We might not have been here last time, but we were here for a good time.
[29:54.240 --> 29:54.340]  What?
[29:54.400 --> 29:55.640]  There's a hand ballista up here.
[29:57.520 --> 29:58.800]  And some other crap.
[29:59.420 --> 30:00.140]  Lightning palm.
[30:00.360 --> 30:01.760]  Oh, I'm just killing other fuckers.
[30:04.740 --> 30:05.580]  This is stupid.
[30:06.300 --> 30:06.960]  Stupid, Andrew.
[30:07.200 --> 30:07.560]  Stupid.
[30:08.000 --> 30:08.920]  Have you gone?
[30:09.100 --> 30:09.420]  Oh, OK.
[30:10.660 --> 30:11.360]  Andrew, where are you?
[30:11.520 --> 30:12.880]  I went back to the level up spot.
[30:12.980 --> 30:13.520]  Now I'm running.
[30:13.680 --> 30:15.060]  It's the circles on our ass.
[30:15.800 --> 30:16.820]  Oh, we gots to go.
[30:19.360 --> 30:21.500]  Oh, I ran past a level up spot on the...
[30:21.500 --> 30:22.140]  I'm an idiot.
[30:24.900 --> 30:27.620]  I ran all the way to the fire when there was one right next to us.
[30:27.620 --> 30:29.200]  I should have done that.
[30:31.620 --> 30:32.940]  Oh, the tower is right here.
[30:34.520 --> 30:35.360]  Is it in the circle?
[30:35.540 --> 30:36.820]  It is not.
[30:36.940 --> 30:37.500]  Where am I?
[30:38.460 --> 30:40.120]  Oh, I'm going the wrong way.
[30:41.340 --> 30:42.240]  Geoff's already in.
[30:43.100 --> 30:45.460]  I'm trying to find a level up spot.
[30:46.660 --> 30:47.800]  To your right.
[30:47.940 --> 30:49.180]  Like diagonal right.
[30:49.420 --> 30:49.520]  Yeah.
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.680]  Definitely want to level up.
[30:53.380 --> 30:54.020]  Hello, fellas.
[30:55.420 --> 30:55.840]  Hello.
[30:57.620 --> 30:58.860]  Oh, sorry, I was killing these guys.
[30:59.060 --> 31:02.220]  I keep getting bathed in XP from you.
[31:02.280 --> 31:03.320]  I appreciate it.
[31:04.080 --> 31:05.960]  Well, it was four gentlemen who met their end.
[31:07.440 --> 31:07.920]  OK.
[31:09.440 --> 31:11.360]  That was very stressful for a moment.
[31:12.400 --> 31:13.220]  Where's the level up thing?
[31:13.460 --> 31:14.580]  It looks like it's back down here.
[31:14.980 --> 31:15.840]  Further out.
[31:16.560 --> 31:16.880]  Oh, OK.
[31:18.340 --> 31:20.440]  Uh oh, dickheads.
[31:21.720 --> 31:23.060]  Excuse me, dickheads.
[31:23.500 --> 31:24.940]  I'll be killing you all.
[31:24.940 --> 31:31.640]  Oh, I thought your health bar was the wolves for a second, and I was like, yeah, that happened
[31:31.640 --> 31:35.260]  to me earlier with you, or I was like, Nick, and then you said, what's wrong?
[31:35.340 --> 31:36.020]  What's I'm fine.
[31:37.320 --> 31:38.680]  I realized my error.
[31:40.540 --> 31:41.100]  All right.
[31:41.200 --> 31:42.960]  I'm at the level of a level up spot.
[31:44.780 --> 31:45.180]  Sweet.
[31:45.500 --> 31:46.280]  We'll be there soon.
[31:47.320 --> 31:47.540]  Yeah.
[31:49.260 --> 31:50.600]  Don't forget to get the grave.
[31:50.660 --> 31:52.920]  Definitely grab this shit comes in handy.
[31:53.020 --> 31:53.340]  Yeah, there.
[31:53.540 --> 31:54.080]  Yeah, somebody is.
[31:54.760 --> 31:55.860]  Oh, who are you?
[31:56.620 --> 31:57.220]  Get out of here.
[31:58.340 --> 31:59.160]  Who are you?
[31:59.820 --> 32:01.080]  Tell me, who are you?
[32:02.580 --> 32:04.520]  Where's Geoff in relation to where the hell we are?
[32:04.700 --> 32:05.560]  I just got attacked.
[32:05.840 --> 32:09.060]  I just got attacked by stones out of the ground over there.
[32:09.980 --> 32:10.740]  Was that you?
[32:11.700 --> 32:12.480]  No, it wasn't me.
[32:12.620 --> 32:13.160]  No, not you guys.
[32:13.180 --> 32:13.840]  I'm talking to this dude.
[32:14.020 --> 32:14.140]  Oh.
[32:17.540 --> 32:19.100]  But yeah, it was definitely not us.
[32:19.160 --> 32:19.860]  Ooh, experience.
[32:21.080 --> 32:22.640]  Go back and just find experience.
[32:22.640 --> 32:24.900]  Okay, these archers are starting to get annoying.
[32:26.320 --> 32:27.060]  Oh, wolves.
[32:31.150 --> 32:34.010]  Oh, this is a man with an arrow and a big wolf.
[32:34.170 --> 32:35.270]  Hubris, hubris, hubris.
[32:35.630 --> 32:37.450]  Super Tim Allen is over here.
[32:38.810 --> 32:39.910]  Got him, got him, got him.
[32:40.210 --> 32:42.370]  I feel like we're far away from each other.
[32:43.090 --> 32:43.610]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:44.110 --> 32:44.550]  Shit.
[32:45.170 --> 32:46.650]  Both so killable.
[32:52.030 --> 32:55.210]  Man, I wish my fucking phone would stop ringing.
[32:56.750 --> 32:58.230]  Is this your Eric impersonation?
[32:59.330 --> 33:01.230]  No, Eric is like, stop texting me.
[33:01.550 --> 33:03.330]  I just want the phone to stop ringing.
[33:03.930 --> 33:06.310]  Okay, I've leveled up a few times now.
[33:08.810 --> 33:09.770]  Wolfie, Wolfie.
[33:10.110 --> 33:11.610]  You can miss that village.
[33:13.270 --> 33:14.130]  There you go.
[33:18.520 --> 33:19.700]  Oh, there's a boss in the village.
[33:21.620 --> 33:22.960]  All right, on my way.
[33:24.200 --> 33:25.880]  I'm at the spot.
[33:25.880 --> 33:30.400]  I guess I'll wait for you guys.
[33:31.940 --> 33:33.440]  Oh, Nick, you're not looking good.
[33:33.520 --> 33:34.540]  Maybe take a potion.
[33:35.340 --> 33:37.060]  Yep, he's not the only one not looking good.
[33:39.180 --> 33:40.400]  I didn't know those guys could do that.
[33:41.820 --> 33:43.920]  Oh, I got hit by a flying pot.
[33:44.120 --> 33:45.380]  There's a lot of shit going on.
[33:45.440 --> 33:46.440]  Oh, Andrew, you're gonna...
[33:46.440 --> 33:46.860]  There you go.
[33:47.920 --> 33:49.020]  Why don't you guys just come up to me?
[33:49.360 --> 33:49.920]  So nice here.
[33:49.940 --> 33:51.520]  Guys, there's a giant throwing shit at me.
[33:54.020 --> 33:55.340]  I'm trying to kill this boss.
[33:55.340 --> 33:55.980]  I want the XP.
[33:57.700 --> 34:01.060]  I wouldn't mind you getting me the XP also, actually.
[34:01.600 --> 34:02.620]  Oh, Andrew, you're about to go down.
[34:02.660 --> 34:02.980]  Be careful.
[34:03.720 --> 34:04.640]  Yep, I sure am.
[34:04.700 --> 34:05.420]  I sure am. I sure am.
[34:05.500 --> 34:05.860]  I sure am.
[34:06.580 --> 34:07.080]  Stay alive.
[34:07.180 --> 34:07.500]  I'm down.
[34:08.480 --> 34:09.140]  Okay, I'm coming.
[34:09.400 --> 34:10.060]  No, Nick's close.
[34:11.600 --> 34:13.360]  Yeah, but you guys must be in a bad way.
[34:13.540 --> 34:13.900]  So I'm gonna...
[34:14.800 --> 34:15.080]  Gotcha.
[34:15.380 --> 34:15.820]  Thank you.
[34:16.180 --> 34:17.020]  Let's go finish this guy.
[34:17.120 --> 34:17.640]  He's on the wolf.
[34:18.700 --> 34:19.440]  He's on the wolf?
[34:19.540 --> 34:21.060]  Yeah, he's riding a wolf and he's shooting arrows.
[34:22.600 --> 34:24.800]  Oh my god, you guys are far away.
[34:25.780 --> 34:27.520]  Okay, we got him, we got him, we got him.
[34:27.960 --> 34:29.420]  Wow, that was merciless.
[34:29.540 --> 34:29.720]  Okay.
[34:31.420 --> 34:32.800]  Uh, no, no.
[34:33.060 --> 34:33.340]  Yes.
[34:34.760 --> 34:35.200]  Okay.
[34:37.060 --> 34:39.640]  Let's, uh, do some reviving.
[34:40.140 --> 34:41.500]  Oh no, level up.
[34:42.400 --> 34:49.560]  So, uh, also if you're wondering, audience, we have three of those bottles of health potion.
[34:49.800 --> 34:53.020]  And then, uh, if we do the level up thing, if you've never played Elden Ring,
[34:53.440 --> 34:55.940]  if you do the level up thing, it replenishes all that.
[34:56.020 --> 34:56.400]  Oh, Geoff!
[34:57.400 --> 34:57.720]  What?
[34:58.840 --> 35:00.220]  Oh, I thought you were in trouble.
[35:00.460 --> 35:01.140]  Uh, well, you know.
[35:01.380 --> 35:02.660]  Seems... seems that you weren't.
[35:03.300 --> 35:05.580]  I was doing okay, but, you know, I appreciate the help.
[35:05.760 --> 35:07.300]  All right, do you guys want to go up to the thing?
[35:08.140 --> 35:09.200]  I'd love to go to the thing.
[35:10.100 --> 35:12.780]  The, uh, the bottom circle things are pretty cool if you use them.
[35:13.740 --> 35:14.060]  Okay.
[35:14.900 --> 35:18.140]  I just used my, my right one this, uh, and it fucked that dude up.
[35:18.900 --> 35:20.800]  I'm trying to remember what the left one is.
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.860]  Oh, right. The left one is the... it's like a grappling hook.
[35:25.120 --> 35:25.360]  Yeah.
[35:27.680 --> 35:28.040]  Yeah.
[35:28.860 --> 35:30.220]  Okay, we got to get to this tree.
[35:31.640 --> 35:32.540]  Circle's closing in.
[35:33.160 --> 35:34.160]  All right, I'm going back to it.
[35:37.610 --> 35:38.330]  Oh, boy.
[35:39.130 --> 35:39.830]  Andrew, hold on.
[35:40.070 --> 35:40.770]  No, I'm going.
[35:41.010 --> 35:42.050]  Okay, that's not the way.
[35:43.930 --> 35:45.570]  Oh, well, that didn't do what I wanted it to do.
[35:45.630 --> 35:46.610]  That's definitely not the way.
[35:47.050 --> 35:47.710]  Down the hole?
[35:48.230 --> 35:48.550]  Yeah.
[35:50.730 --> 35:51.730]  Seemed like a real problem.
[35:54.090 --> 35:54.930]  Where's the jump up?
[35:55.010 --> 35:55.450]  Where do I go?
[35:55.830 --> 35:57.630]  We're gonna need a jump up of some kind somewhere.
[35:57.730 --> 35:58.550]  Oh, there it is.
[35:59.070 --> 35:59.430]  Where?
[35:59.750 --> 36:00.550]  To the right.
[36:00.670 --> 36:01.450]  Yeah, I'm at it.
[36:01.530 --> 36:02.010]  Oh, I see it.
[36:02.010 --> 36:02.330]  If you can be on the map.
[36:05.450 --> 36:06.370]  And I'm right with you.
[36:06.530 --> 36:07.350]  Baby Pepsi.
[36:08.630 --> 36:08.990]  Woohoo!
[36:12.170 --> 36:12.670]  All right.
[36:14.390 --> 36:14.990]  What's that?
[36:15.570 --> 36:16.310]  Uh, I don't know.
[36:17.150 --> 36:18.570]  Take hold of spectral hawk.
[36:19.110 --> 36:21.230]  It's flying me into the fire!
[36:21.770 --> 36:21.910]  No!
[36:23.310 --> 36:24.550]  Taking us to the fire!
[36:24.570 --> 36:25.590]  Descend, descend!
[36:25.830 --> 36:28.130]  Hold Y, hold Y, hold Y!
[36:28.930 --> 36:29.370]  Hold on.
[36:30.550 --> 36:31.010]  What?
[36:31.270 --> 36:31.990]  Does it bark?
[36:32.170 --> 36:34.130]  Oh my god, we gotta go, go, go, go!
[36:34.530 --> 36:35.950]  The eagles have killed us.
[36:36.150 --> 36:37.850]  The fucking hawks, the falcons!
[36:37.970 --> 36:38.970]  There's you guys.
[36:40.070 --> 36:40.670]  Come on, jump!
[36:41.530 --> 36:43.490]  Our greatest friends became our greatest enemies.
[36:43.970 --> 36:47.330]  All right, I'm gonna take a second to look at the...
[36:48.150 --> 36:48.590]  chat.
[36:48.730 --> 36:50.570]  Geoff's just chilling in the circle.
[36:51.330 --> 36:52.550]  Everything's breaking for us.
[36:52.650 --> 36:54.450]  I'm gonna take a second to look at chat.
[36:55.270 --> 36:56.490]  I appreciate that, Geoff.
[36:57.070 --> 36:57.770]  Yeah, thanks Geoff.
[36:57.970 --> 36:58.430]  Yeah, no problem.
[36:58.770 --> 36:59.710]  They're not talking to us.
[36:59.830 --> 37:00.330]  Hey, what's up?
[37:00.430 --> 37:01.270]  They're talking about other games.
[37:01.350 --> 37:03.170]  They're talking about regulation 30 or expedition 33.
[37:04.030 --> 37:07.310]  You guys called out atomic bomb for a five sub bomb drop,
[37:07.370 --> 37:10.310]  but you didn't notice the 60 subs they dropped a few minutes earlier.
[37:10.870 --> 37:11.570]  Oh my god!
[37:12.130 --> 37:14.350]  Thanks for the 60 subs you dropped a few minutes earlier.
[37:14.870 --> 37:15.470]  Uh, yeah.
[37:15.870 --> 37:16.730]  That's so nice.
[37:17.770 --> 37:18.170]  That's...
[37:18.170 --> 37:19.630]  I'm so sorry we didn't see that.
[37:20.410 --> 37:21.830]  What is the math on that?
[37:22.170 --> 37:23.530]  It's a lot more than the five.
[37:24.670 --> 37:27.110]  A lot of fun to play and stream.
[37:27.210 --> 37:27.550]  That's for you.
[37:27.610 --> 37:28.310]  Tough to see chat.
[37:28.430 --> 37:29.670]  Ow, son of a bitch!
[37:29.790 --> 37:30.390]  Tough to chat.
[37:32.510 --> 37:33.810]  Oh, I don't know.
[37:33.910 --> 37:34.810]  What is Nick doing?
[37:35.410 --> 37:35.950]  I'm fighting!
[37:36.250 --> 37:37.510]  Oh, we got little guys.
[37:39.070 --> 37:39.690]  And a boss guy.
[37:40.250 --> 37:40.810]  Where are you guys?
[37:41.410 --> 37:42.050]  Are you by the circle?
[37:42.850 --> 37:43.350]  Oh, fuck.
[37:47.140 --> 37:48.460]  All right, well, I'm here.
[37:51.160 --> 37:53.480]  Killing the minions so the boss spawns.
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.020]  Oh, I just hit him with a big attack.
[37:55.140 --> 37:56.280]  That fucked him up horribly.
[37:56.280 --> 37:57.180]  Got you in the back, prick.
[37:59.260 --> 38:00.000]  Dude, he's a big attack.
[38:00.000 --> 38:00.580]  That's a stunner.
[38:01.060 --> 38:01.340]  Nice.
[38:02.160 --> 38:02.640]  Stone cold.
[38:02.720 --> 38:03.120]  Nice teamwork.
[38:04.120 --> 38:05.200]  Oh, he's still alive?
[38:07.260 --> 38:08.200]  It's a stunner, not a killer.
[38:09.400 --> 38:09.820]  I just...
[38:09.820 --> 38:10.460]  I thought it was...
[38:10.460 --> 38:11.120]  I thought he was dead.
[38:11.720 --> 38:12.480]  Okay, that's rude.
[38:12.540 --> 38:13.420]  I was in an animation.
[38:13.580 --> 38:14.640]  You shouldn't be allowed to do that.
[38:15.460 --> 38:16.300]  Oh, did I take that?
[38:16.400 --> 38:16.680]  I'm sorry.
[38:17.020 --> 38:17.580]  No, it's all good.
[38:17.580 --> 38:19.520]  No, he hit me while I was in an animation.
[38:19.820 --> 38:20.280]  Oh, I see.
[38:20.480 --> 38:22.480]  You can kill whatever you want at any time.
[38:22.740 --> 38:22.820]  Oh, no.
[38:22.840 --> 38:23.160]  Fights.
[38:23.260 --> 38:24.140]  Fight the bosses.
[38:24.540 --> 38:24.840]  Yeah.
[38:25.000 --> 38:25.480]  Bad guys.
[38:26.060 --> 38:26.240]  Uh-oh.
[38:26.780 --> 38:27.180]  Uh-oh.
[38:27.880 --> 38:28.480]  Run away.
[38:29.800 --> 38:31.380]  Okay, let me see what I can do.
[38:31.620 --> 38:32.020]  Ow!
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.260]  Son of a bitch.
[38:34.600 --> 38:36.140]  Trying to get in that asshole.
[38:37.200 --> 38:37.740]  Fire pot.
[38:37.920 --> 38:38.780]  Fucking prick.
[38:39.160 --> 38:39.400]  All right.
[38:40.320 --> 38:40.880]  Fire pot.
[38:40.960 --> 38:41.480]  That's a heal.
[38:43.460 --> 38:43.860]  Ow.
[38:47.860 --> 38:48.260]  Yep.
[38:50.640 --> 38:51.160]  Oh, heal.
[38:51.420 --> 38:52.100]  Love it.
[38:53.040 --> 38:53.820]  I'm healing us.
[38:54.280 --> 38:54.460]  I think.
[38:54.740 --> 38:54.760]  Nice.
[38:54.760 --> 38:55.320]  Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[38:55.320 --> 38:56.100]  Yeah, just stay in the thing.
[38:56.120 --> 38:56.400]  I got frostbite.
[38:58.120 --> 38:58.440]  Ow!
[38:58.540 --> 39:00.040]  You little fucking dickhead.
[39:00.200 --> 39:00.580]  I know.
[39:00.660 --> 39:01.700]  They're such little dickheads.
[39:02.360 --> 39:03.260]  What would their dickhead be?
[39:03.260 --> 39:04.640]  Hey, he's spawning in a bunch of guys.
[39:05.980 --> 39:06.820]  Blame it on frenzy.
[39:07.580 --> 39:08.220]  Oh, I'm hitting him right...
[39:08.220 --> 39:08.940]  I hit him so...
[39:08.940 --> 39:10.500]  I split his asshole right in half.
[39:10.900 --> 39:11.220]  Nice.
[39:11.280 --> 39:12.720]  He's gonna try to colostomy bag.
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.940]  He may win this fight, but he's not gonna live well.
[39:16.380 --> 39:17.460]  Oh, he's out of the fire.
[39:17.740 --> 39:19.560]  That should be doing damage to you, you bitch.
[39:21.280 --> 39:21.660]  It's...
[39:21.660 --> 39:22.260]  Oh, shit.
[39:22.360 --> 39:22.860]  I'm under attack.
[39:23.200 --> 39:23.680]  Under attack.
[39:23.920 --> 39:24.340]  Under attack.
[39:24.740 --> 39:25.040]  Run away.
[39:25.500 --> 39:26.940]  Does it do damage to him when he's under the fire?
[39:26.940 --> 39:27.680]  I don't think so.
[39:27.980 --> 39:28.980]  It didn't look like it was.
[39:30.260 --> 39:30.900]  Oh, fuck.
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.280]  I don't even see this little prick.
[39:32.900 --> 39:33.720]  Obviously, it's fair.
[39:36.120 --> 39:36.640]  All right.
[39:38.740 --> 39:40.280]  Oh, you little asshole.
[39:43.060 --> 39:44.140]  I'm working on the ads.
[39:44.140 --> 39:46.120]  God, I am so bad at deflecting this little dude.
[39:48.120 --> 39:48.700]  I'm down.
[39:50.400 --> 39:51.260]  Can you get him, Geoff?
[39:51.800 --> 39:53.120]  Yeah, yeah, I'm headed for you right now.
[39:53.480 --> 39:54.100]  Thank you.
[39:54.660 --> 39:56.100]  He's so far out of the circle.
[39:56.360 --> 39:56.420]  Fuck.
[39:56.460 --> 39:57.320]  He's so far out.
[39:57.380 --> 39:57.880]  You should be taking damage.
[39:57.880 --> 39:59.180]  Hold on, you piece of shit.
[39:59.580 --> 40:01.060]  The other boss is on top of Nick.
[40:01.180 --> 40:01.820]  Fuck, I'm dead.
[40:02.040 --> 40:02.840]  Okay, I'm on my way.
[40:03.420 --> 40:03.700]  Oh, no.
[40:03.700 --> 40:05.340]  He was hiding in the bushes, dude.
[40:05.480 --> 40:06.440]  The little mini one.
[40:06.880 --> 40:07.660]  Okay, Nick's up.
[40:08.340 --> 40:08.660]  Get...
[40:08.660 --> 40:08.840]  All right.
[40:08.880 --> 40:09.140]  Thank you.
[40:11.320 --> 40:11.980]  I'm almost up.
[40:12.420 --> 40:13.920]  You're gonna hit me like two more times, maybe.
[40:13.940 --> 40:14.540]  Yeah, on my way to you.
[40:14.560 --> 40:16.100]  With that little motherfucker on top of me.
[40:16.320 --> 40:17.280]  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[40:17.980 --> 40:18.400]  Are you up?
[40:18.480 --> 40:19.080]  Okay, now you're up.
[40:19.780 --> 40:20.580]  I'm up, I'm up.
[40:20.600 --> 40:22.520]  The demi-human queen is almost dead.
[40:23.200 --> 40:23.420]  Yep.
[40:25.220 --> 40:27.300]  Oh, that little fucker boss.
[40:27.840 --> 40:28.500]  He's down.
[40:28.800 --> 40:29.680]  He's down for right now.
[40:29.840 --> 40:30.560]  Hit him while he's down.
[40:31.920 --> 40:32.740]  Okay, the queen's dead.
[40:33.400 --> 40:34.360]  Oh, he threw me.
[40:34.720 --> 40:35.520]  Little son of a bitch.
[40:37.680 --> 40:38.820]  Oh, Nick's down.
[40:38.820 --> 40:39.140]  Nick's down.
[40:39.220 --> 40:39.900]  Oh, God.
[40:40.320 --> 40:41.000]  Going for Nick.
[40:41.800 --> 40:42.540]  Sorry, you go for Nick.
[40:42.600 --> 40:43.460]  I'll fuck with this dude.
[40:44.020 --> 40:44.600]  Oh, God.
[40:45.160 --> 40:46.300]  Son of a bitch.
[40:47.040 --> 40:47.400]  Thank you.
[40:47.400 --> 40:47.740]  Hey, Nick's up.
[40:47.820 --> 40:48.180]  I'm back.
[40:52.650 --> 40:53.850]  I missed that.
[40:53.990 --> 40:54.450]  That's great.
[40:55.270 --> 40:56.230]  Oh, fuck.
[40:56.290 --> 40:56.690]  I'm down.
[40:57.730 --> 40:58.510]  Coming for you.
[40:58.610 --> 40:59.110]  Thank you.
[41:00.510 --> 41:00.990]  Gotcha.
[41:03.030 --> 41:03.890]  Oh, I'm down.
[41:04.430 --> 41:04.910]  Fuck.
[41:06.470 --> 41:08.190]  This guy fucking sucks.
[41:08.590 --> 41:09.950]  He sucks so hard.
[41:10.050 --> 41:11.190]  He's such a hard sucker.
[41:11.570 --> 41:12.530]  He just threw me.
[41:12.610 --> 41:13.390]  I'm almost up.
[41:13.470 --> 41:14.030]  I'm almost up.
[41:14.170 --> 41:14.750]  I gotcha, I gotcha.
[41:15.310 --> 41:15.790]  I'm up, I'm up.
[41:15.790 --> 41:15.810]  Jesus.
[41:17.170 --> 41:17.990]  All right, I'm...
[41:17.990 --> 41:19.490]  Don't let up on that little prick.
[41:19.630 --> 41:20.410]  Get him, get him, get him.
[41:20.810 --> 41:22.330]  Oh, we're doing such good damage.
[41:23.530 --> 41:24.130]  Oh, fuck.
[41:24.210 --> 41:24.510]  I missed.
[41:24.870 --> 41:26.150]  He's in the bushes again.
[41:26.230 --> 41:27.130]  I can't see him.
[41:27.370 --> 41:27.430]  Get away.
[41:27.430 --> 41:28.870]  You can't find him when he's in the bushes.
[41:29.010 --> 41:30.370]  He's a little bitch like that.
[41:30.830 --> 41:31.650]  Oh, you prick.
[41:31.710 --> 41:32.330]  I got him in the back.
[41:32.490 --> 41:33.090]  That's how we fuck.
[41:34.290 --> 41:35.150]  Nice, Nick.
[41:35.270 --> 41:36.050]  Oh, he's dead.
[41:36.090 --> 41:36.590]  He's dead.
[41:36.650 --> 41:37.650]  Nick, that's all you, buddy.
[41:37.750 --> 41:38.250]  You did that.
[41:39.950 --> 41:40.450]  That's a...
[41:40.450 --> 41:40.870]  You know what?
[41:40.910 --> 41:41.970]  That's a special kind of victory.
[41:42.050 --> 41:43.090]  I like to call it a Nick-tory.
[41:44.470 --> 41:45.370]  Hell yeah, dude.
[41:45.370 --> 41:46.590]  I'll take that all day.
[41:48.430 --> 41:48.750]  Oh.
[41:50.410 --> 41:51.470]  I'll take that.
[41:52.070 --> 41:54.910]  So these like create holy ground at low HP.
[41:55.490 --> 41:57.690]  This is a permanent buff or...
[41:57.690 --> 41:58.120]  Do I have to...
[41:58.850 --> 42:00.010]  Is that passive?
[42:00.010 --> 42:01.970]  I think it's a permanent buff for the round.
[42:02.290 --> 42:02.770]  That makes sense.
[42:02.770 --> 42:03.330]  Yeah, for the round.
[42:03.450 --> 42:04.030]  Oh, OK.
[42:05.130 --> 42:06.190]  Don't forget to level up.
[42:07.330 --> 42:07.890]  Oh, shit.
[42:08.810 --> 42:10.210]  Do they not know how to lock on?
[42:10.550 --> 42:11.570]  Do we know how to lock on?
[42:12.210 --> 42:13.150]  You click right stick.
[42:13.770 --> 42:15.270]  Yeah, I remember that was in the tutorial.
[42:15.510 --> 42:16.650]  Oh, right.
[42:16.850 --> 42:17.650]  Lock on.
[42:18.050 --> 42:18.510]  Whoops.
[42:20.670 --> 42:21.930]  So they answer your question.
[42:22.090 --> 42:23.230]  No, but now we do.
[42:23.350 --> 42:23.870]  Thank you.
[42:24.850 --> 42:26.130]  I didn't play the original.
[42:28.250 --> 42:29.250]  All right.
[42:29.330 --> 42:30.570]  Leveled up a couple times.
[42:31.250 --> 42:33.110]  Well, we did pretty well for not locking on.
[42:33.530 --> 42:34.030]  Yeah.
[42:34.670 --> 42:36.190]  What if it makes us worse?
[42:36.570 --> 42:38.170]  Oh, that's entirely possible.
[42:39.090 --> 42:40.110]  Should we go to this cathedral?
[42:43.820 --> 42:45.280]  Yeah, let's do it.
[42:46.260 --> 42:46.760]  Oh.
[42:48.020 --> 42:49.480]  You should be able to restock.
[42:50.420 --> 42:52.100]  Temporarily boost stamina recovery.
[42:52.360 --> 42:53.060]  Oh, that'll be helpful.
[42:54.900 --> 42:56.580]  Levy its impending blood loss.
[42:59.500 --> 43:00.160]  What's this?
[43:01.220 --> 43:02.800]  Oh, add a charge to your flask.
[43:03.180 --> 43:03.700]  Yeah, I did that.
[43:03.800 --> 43:04.160]  It was cool.
[43:04.700 --> 43:05.720]  That's going to be helpful.
[43:05.920 --> 43:06.280]  Andrew?
[43:07.120 --> 43:07.500]  On my way.
[43:07.820 --> 43:10.180]  Is that permanent or is that a one-time deal?
[43:10.660 --> 43:11.420]  I have no idea.
[43:13.260 --> 43:14.020]  We should probably...
[43:15.480 --> 43:15.780]  Kill things?
[43:17.000 --> 43:18.440]  Yeah, make our way towards...
[43:19.840 --> 43:21.240]  Oh, we don't know anything yet.
[43:22.080 --> 43:23.060]  We don't know that.
[43:23.260 --> 43:24.300]  We don't know anything.
[43:24.460 --> 43:25.560]  Oh, bridge.
[43:25.920 --> 43:27.920]  Oh, look at this giant dude.
[43:28.280 --> 43:28.540]  Uh-oh.
[43:28.740 --> 43:29.460]  There's a giant dude?
[43:30.260 --> 43:30.940]  Yeah, look on the...
[43:31.520 --> 43:32.040]  Going to you.
[43:33.360 --> 43:34.160]  Coming to you, Nick.
[43:34.480 --> 43:35.120]  Follow me.
[43:35.660 --> 43:36.380]  He's up there.
[43:36.680 --> 43:37.860]  Oh, yeah, it's a giant man.
[43:38.180 --> 43:38.800]  Oh, he's a big...
[43:38.800 --> 43:39.600]  Oh, Jesus.
[43:39.920 --> 43:40.900]  He's got a big old bow and arrow.
[43:41.040 --> 43:43.040]  Oh, he's getting ready to fire.
[43:43.520 --> 43:44.120]  Get in cover.
[43:44.700 --> 43:45.800]  Go behind the bridge.
[43:45.900 --> 43:46.380]  Go behind the bridge.
[43:46.380 --> 43:48.620]  I don't think there's a bridge big enough to stop that arrow.
[43:48.860 --> 43:49.080]  What is this?
[43:49.680 --> 43:51.820]  Look at that fucking thing.
[43:52.940 --> 43:54.920]  Oh, I want to see him shoot it.
[43:58.600 --> 43:59.320]  I'm going up.
[44:00.100 --> 44:00.820]  Oh, goodness.
[44:02.380 --> 44:02.980]  On my way up, too.
[44:03.040 --> 44:04.360]  How do I get up there?
[44:06.280 --> 44:07.260]  I can't shoot me.
[44:07.360 --> 44:08.060]  I'm too close to him.
[44:12.150 --> 44:13.470]  Let's get this press open.
[44:13.910 --> 44:14.090]  No.
[44:16.050 --> 44:17.530]  What are we...
[44:17.530 --> 44:18.170]  I guess going around.
[44:19.070 --> 44:19.610]  He's lucky.
[44:19.850 --> 44:21.470]  He's lucky we can't figure out how to get up there to kill him.
[44:21.610 --> 44:23.270]  He's lucky I got stuck in a tree.
[44:26.410 --> 44:27.630]  He's just thinking that.
[44:29.130 --> 44:30.130]  Now we've turned a corner.
[44:34.340 --> 44:36.220]  I would like to get in your castle, sir.
[44:38.400 --> 44:40.740]  Today might be your lucky day, buddy.
[44:41.840 --> 44:42.440]  How do we...
[44:43.360 --> 44:44.720]  Has to be a way in this thing.
[44:46.280 --> 44:47.520]  Going around on the right.
[44:47.880 --> 44:50.240]  I will say we're pretty close to the edge.
[44:51.520 --> 44:52.240]  Of glory?
[44:52.720 --> 44:53.480]  Of game.
[44:53.800 --> 44:54.180]  Oh.
[44:58.840 --> 45:00.460]  Oh, I think I found a way in.
[45:01.360 --> 45:01.960]  Oh, bugs.
[45:03.540 --> 45:04.620]  Oh, they're underground.
[45:04.780 --> 45:05.340]  Stupid bugs.
[45:05.440 --> 45:07.840]  Yeah, if you come to me, there's like a little underground passage.
[45:08.240 --> 45:09.900]  Oh, that's where we started this whole quest.
[45:10.080 --> 45:10.760]  Sure is.
[45:11.980 --> 45:12.360]  Rats!
[45:13.160 --> 45:13.540]  Rats!
[45:14.080 --> 45:15.720]  Why does it always have to be rats?
[45:17.020 --> 45:17.400]  Oh!
[45:17.600 --> 45:18.580]  Oh, big rats.
[45:19.920 --> 45:20.760]  Dude, like Willard.
[45:24.320 --> 45:26.860]  Oh, oh, Eric, what happened to you?
[45:27.460 --> 45:29.000]  What have they done to you, my boy?
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.060]  Better not see any of those in a Bart Simpson shirt and shorts.
[45:40.730 --> 45:41.470]  Good kill.
[45:42.150 --> 45:47.170]  Oh, right.
[45:48.950 --> 45:49.850]  Oh, there's a big rat.
[45:50.330 --> 45:50.790]  Oh, rat.
[45:51.090 --> 45:52.810]  Oh, dude, he's about to take a chunk out of you.
[45:55.670 --> 45:56.190]  Ow.
[45:58.710 --> 46:01.110]  Oh, oh, pick that.
[46:01.750 --> 46:02.730]  How the fuck do I?
[46:02.870 --> 46:02.990]  OK.
[46:04.990 --> 46:05.510]  Nice.
[46:08.470 --> 46:10.790]  Oh, we're opening this castle up.
[46:13.510 --> 46:14.610]  Oh, I missed that guy.
[46:15.350 --> 46:15.850]  Didn't matter.
[46:18.090 --> 46:19.390]  Oh, chest over here.
[46:20.810 --> 46:21.450]  Are you down there?
[46:21.670 --> 46:21.790]  Yeah.
[46:24.750 --> 46:25.650]  He's almost dead.
[46:25.750 --> 46:26.390]  I'm fucking him up.
[46:26.570 --> 46:27.390]  Oh, shit.
[46:28.250 --> 46:28.950]  I'm going up.
[46:30.350 --> 46:31.110]  Roll away.
[46:32.170 --> 46:33.330]  Yeah, he fucked.
[46:33.650 --> 46:34.750]  He don't let him step on you.
[46:35.130 --> 46:35.690]  It's owie.
[46:36.330 --> 46:36.970]  On my way.
[46:37.490 --> 46:38.390]  Oh, I knocked him down.
[46:38.670 --> 46:39.070]  Nice.
[46:39.390 --> 46:40.110]  Nice, dude.
[46:44.940 --> 46:45.620]  Knock him down again.
[46:46.840 --> 46:47.220]  Easy.
[46:47.640 --> 46:48.080]  Somebody knocked him up.
[46:49.840 --> 46:50.520]  He's dead.
[46:51.000 --> 46:51.480]  Wow.
[46:52.500 --> 46:54.420]  I don't want either of those shitty things.
[46:56.900 --> 46:57.160]  OK.
[46:57.620 --> 46:58.540]  Oh, I can't level up yet.
[46:59.080 --> 47:00.780]  Oh, more soldiers up here.
[47:00.840 --> 47:01.380]  Oh, chests.
[47:03.020 --> 47:03.880]  No, I took...
[47:03.880 --> 47:04.340]  Ah, shit.
[47:07.820 --> 47:10.000]  Guys, there's a chest down here if you want anything.
[47:11.220 --> 47:12.380]  Damn, I can't level up yet.
[47:14.380 --> 47:15.720]  All I want to do is level up.
[47:16.100 --> 47:17.400]  I want to be frustrated like you guys.
[47:17.720 --> 47:18.980]  Oh, I can't level up yet.
[47:21.000 --> 47:21.900]  How are we doing?
[47:22.120 --> 47:22.660]  Not great.
[47:22.900 --> 47:23.820]  We should probably get to the circle.
[47:24.060 --> 47:24.460]  We got to go.
[47:24.580 --> 47:25.480]  Oh, yeah, we should definitely.
[47:25.480 --> 47:27.320]  Forgot we weren't already in the mini circle.
[47:29.260 --> 47:30.120]  All right, full balls.
[47:30.300 --> 47:30.480]  Run.
[47:31.400 --> 47:32.120]  Full balls.
[47:35.200 --> 47:36.360]  I'm going to make a little detour.
[47:36.620 --> 47:37.420]  Guys, I apologize now.
[47:37.480 --> 47:38.740]  I'm running full balls, so...
[47:40.740 --> 47:41.640]  I hope you're able to keep up.
[47:41.700 --> 47:42.080]  Oh, the bird.
[47:42.180 --> 47:43.260]  We can take the bird.
[47:43.900 --> 47:44.860]  There's a man on a horse.
[47:45.380 --> 47:45.960]  Man on a horse.
[47:45.960 --> 47:46.660]  Kill horseman.
[47:48.180 --> 47:48.360]  No.
[47:49.380 --> 47:49.740]  Yes.
[47:50.440 --> 47:50.800]  Yes.
[47:51.000 --> 47:51.240]  OK.
[47:51.760 --> 47:51.960]  Yeah.
[47:52.240 --> 47:52.760]  Leave him.
[47:53.000 --> 47:53.340]  Leave him.
[47:53.500 --> 47:54.120]  We don't have the time.
[47:54.540 --> 47:54.720]  Yeah.
[47:54.720 --> 47:55.680]  Time to fly.
[47:59.040 --> 47:59.960]  Oh, oh.
[48:00.200 --> 48:03.380]  Am I way in my home when I learned to fly?
[48:04.180 --> 48:04.600]  Here we go.
[48:04.900 --> 48:08.100]  No idea about these birds that you can fly from.
[48:08.180 --> 48:09.880]  I've never seen that, but it sounds cool.
[48:10.300 --> 48:12.360]  Oh, Geoff, you went the wrong way for the ghost tree.
[48:15.300 --> 48:16.340]  Oh, oh no.
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.880]  Uh, oh, where are you?
[48:21.040 --> 48:22.800]  I want to go into this building thing.
[48:23.240 --> 48:23.940]  I'm down.
[48:23.940 --> 48:26.040]  Yeah, I want to check that building out, too.
[48:30.640 --> 48:31.040]  Geoff?
[48:31.660 --> 48:32.060]  Hello.
[48:32.780 --> 48:33.200]  Are you OK?
[48:33.460 --> 48:33.920]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.760]  Oh, I just know we're near you guys.
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.380]  This is some like shroud shit.
[48:38.540 --> 48:39.020]  Oh, yeah.
[48:39.020 --> 48:40.440]  Arise's contraption is unlocked.
[48:42.640 --> 48:44.560]  I'm a long way away from you guys.
[48:44.680 --> 48:45.700]  Oh, starlight shards.
[48:47.060 --> 48:48.220]  I'm not a happy tree, though.
[48:48.320 --> 48:48.960]  What's this about?
[48:51.920 --> 48:52.320]  Huh.
[48:52.520 --> 48:53.220]  Boosted something.
[48:54.180 --> 48:55.320]  Anything cool out here?
[48:56.080 --> 48:56.320]  Oh.
[48:59.060 --> 48:59.620]  Are you OK?
[48:59.820 --> 49:00.360]  I just thought it was.
[49:00.580 --> 49:01.740]  Yeah, I thought it was one of you guys.
[49:03.100 --> 49:04.180]  Oh, Nick, you fool.
[49:04.220 --> 49:04.600]  You fool.
[49:04.660 --> 49:05.280]  You foolish fool.
[49:10.020 --> 49:11.260]  Go ahead and do this.
[49:13.620 --> 49:14.380]  Uh, all right.
[49:14.580 --> 49:14.840]  All right.
[49:14.940 --> 49:15.940]  Where do we want to go?
[49:16.960 --> 49:19.040]  Yeah, we just run around and kill at this point, right?
[49:19.120 --> 49:21.620]  Do you want to head towards that castle kind of thing?
[49:22.220 --> 49:22.440]  Yeah.
[49:22.780 --> 49:25.000]  Oh, we got like a boss looks like to the left.
[49:25.040 --> 49:25.740]  We could fight that.
[49:26.300 --> 49:27.240]  Yeah, let's go fuck him up.
[49:27.320 --> 49:28.380]  Oh, is this that winged thing?
[49:30.760 --> 49:35.060]  It's like a Tony Hawk skateboard deck villain.
[49:38.280 --> 49:39.900]  This is for you.
[49:42.640 --> 49:44.400]  Oh, that was for me.
[49:46.460 --> 49:47.420]  Oh, shit.
[49:47.440 --> 49:47.760]  I'm down.
[49:49.300 --> 49:50.040]  Oh, shit.
[49:50.100 --> 49:50.280]  Really?
[49:50.960 --> 49:51.600]  Thank you.
[49:51.740 --> 49:52.040]  You're up.
[49:52.140 --> 49:52.420]  You're up.
[49:52.480 --> 49:52.780]  You're up.
[49:53.460 --> 49:54.040]  I'm down.
[49:54.040 --> 49:54.540]  I'm down, though.
[49:54.580 --> 49:55.240]  I'm definitely down.
[49:57.660 --> 49:59.120]  Oh, it's eating me.
[50:00.400 --> 50:01.120]  Oh, shit.
[50:03.720 --> 50:04.460]  There we go.
[50:04.700 --> 50:05.360]  I'm down again.
[50:05.460 --> 50:05.940]  I'm sorry.
[50:06.540 --> 50:08.020]  It ate me as soon as I got up.
[50:08.640 --> 50:09.020]  I'm coming to you.
[50:09.120 --> 50:09.900]  I'll distract it.
[50:10.880 --> 50:11.680]  Oh, I need to heal.
[50:12.460 --> 50:12.780]  Oh, balls.
[50:13.120 --> 50:13.520]  Oh, balls.
[50:13.780 --> 50:14.200]  Oh, balls.
[50:14.420 --> 50:14.820]  Oh, balls.
[50:15.820 --> 50:16.180]  Oh, balls.
[50:16.180 --> 50:16.540]  Oh, balls.
[50:18.120 --> 50:18.840]  All right.
[50:19.160 --> 50:20.080]  We're coming for you.
[50:20.180 --> 50:20.320]  I'm down.
[50:22.780 --> 50:23.540]  I'm going for Nick.
[50:24.800 --> 50:25.160]  Please.
[50:25.480 --> 50:25.760]  I'm fine.
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.220]  Thank you.
[50:27.320 --> 50:28.040]  I'm down.
[50:32.420 --> 50:36.940]  Boy, clicking on the right stick really helps when you're trying to hit the person on the ground.
[50:39.860 --> 50:40.480]  Oh, yeah.
[50:40.600 --> 50:41.300]  I'll be up soon.
[50:42.160 --> 50:42.760]  I'm down.
[50:42.980 --> 50:43.580]  Fuck me.
[50:43.680 --> 50:44.180]  I'm almost up.
[50:44.280 --> 50:44.640]  One more hit on me.
[50:44.640 --> 50:46.160]  Would you probably abandon this fight?
[50:47.040 --> 50:47.960]  Is it almost dead?
[50:48.580 --> 50:48.900]  No.
[50:49.440 --> 50:49.680]  No.
[50:50.580 --> 50:50.980]  Run.
[50:51.080 --> 50:51.560]  Nick, you're up.
[50:51.880 --> 50:52.500]  All right, let's run.
[50:52.980 --> 50:53.380]  Balls.
[50:54.860 --> 50:55.960]  Cut your losses, fellas.
[50:58.920 --> 50:59.520]  What's this?
[51:00.040 --> 51:00.900]  I don't know, but we need it.
[51:01.380 --> 51:01.700]  Yeah.
[51:02.800 --> 51:03.600]  Didn't even read it.
[51:03.640 --> 51:04.000]  Don't care.
[51:04.200 --> 51:04.780]  Just take it.
[51:05.280 --> 51:05.340]  Yeah.
[51:05.920 --> 51:06.180]  Don't give a fuck.
[51:06.180 --> 51:06.620]  To the church.
[51:07.540 --> 51:08.400]  Oh, it got me.
[51:08.460 --> 51:08.840]  It got me.
[51:08.880 --> 51:09.560]  I was trying to leave it.
[51:09.580 --> 51:10.120]  It got me.
[51:10.740 --> 51:11.200]  Oh, no.
[51:11.280 --> 51:12.300]  We got to go back and get Andrew.
[51:13.000 --> 51:13.680]  Oh, God.
[51:13.700 --> 51:14.620]  We're not going to make it in time.
[51:14.760 --> 51:14.920]  Oh, no.
[51:14.940 --> 51:16.060]  I'm leaving out real fast.
[51:16.800 --> 51:17.420]  Oh, no.
[51:18.220 --> 51:18.860]  Oh, God.
[51:18.920 --> 51:19.600]  Oh, no.
[51:19.620 --> 51:20.200]  Maybe he'll respawn.
[51:20.200 --> 51:20.780]  Just live.
[51:20.860 --> 51:21.740]  Just live your lives.
[51:22.440 --> 51:22.920]  He'll respawn.
[51:23.160 --> 51:23.480]  He'll respawn.
[51:23.760 --> 51:23.980]  We're not going to lose.
[51:24.160 --> 51:24.600]  He'll respawn.
[51:24.880 --> 51:25.740]  He'll lose a level.
[51:25.860 --> 51:26.260]  A level?
[51:26.400 --> 51:26.540]  Okay.
[51:26.620 --> 51:27.040]  Just one?
[51:27.040 --> 51:27.640]  We'll make it up.
[51:27.680 --> 51:28.180]  I can live with that.
[51:28.300 --> 51:28.700]  I think so.
[51:29.660 --> 51:30.260]  You'll lose your...
[51:31.500 --> 51:31.960]  Oh, what's this dude?
[51:31.980 --> 51:32.180]  Runes.
[51:32.200 --> 51:32.760]  Yeah, level seven.
[51:32.900 --> 51:33.100]  Okay.
[51:34.100 --> 51:34.520]  I'll go get him.
[51:34.520 --> 51:35.000]  This guy's got no head.
[51:35.060 --> 51:35.800]  He should be easy to...
[51:36.500 --> 51:37.360]  He'll never see us.
[51:37.400 --> 51:37.800]  There we go.
[51:42.280 --> 51:44.040]  It's not even near where I died now.
[51:51.300 --> 51:56.530]  Oh, here comes a shield, dude.
[51:56.930 --> 51:57.210]  Yeah.
[51:57.410 --> 51:58.590]  I'm going to heal up real fast.
[52:00.790 --> 52:01.870]  Oh, where the hell is my shield?
[52:02.010 --> 52:02.450]  Oh, there it is.
[52:03.410 --> 52:03.690]  Wow.
[52:03.710 --> 52:04.270]  He was a bitch.
[52:04.410 --> 52:05.650]  Just a little bitch.
[52:05.770 --> 52:05.850]  Yeah.
[52:05.890 --> 52:06.830]  It wasn't a big deal at all.
[52:10.360 --> 52:11.160]  Fire grease.
[52:11.460 --> 52:12.260]  I'll take that.
[52:12.760 --> 52:13.200]  All right.
[52:13.700 --> 52:14.240]  All right.
[52:14.240 --> 52:14.780]  How are you doing, Andrew?
[52:15.000 --> 52:15.580]  I'm good.
[52:16.860 --> 52:18.100]  Got my stuff back.
[52:18.180 --> 52:20.000]  I'm just going to level up again to get back to eight.
[52:22.180 --> 52:22.820]  A short pitch.
[52:33.160 --> 52:34.600]  Do anything worth taking?
[52:34.780 --> 52:35.980]  Pickled turtle neck.
[52:36.340 --> 52:37.600]  Atomic Bomb also giving Patreon subs.
[52:37.700 --> 52:38.860]  Thank you so much, Atomic Bomb.
[52:39.200 --> 52:40.040]  Thank you, Atomic Bomb.
[52:40.240 --> 52:43.400]  Atomic Bomb, you're an atomic bomb of good.
[52:44.180 --> 52:44.580]  Yeah.
[52:45.540 --> 52:48.100]  You're exploding joy all over the universe.
[52:48.460 --> 52:49.360]  Thank you for doing that.
[52:53.550 --> 52:55.350]  I am become donator.
[52:56.250 --> 52:57.570]  I am become kind.
[52:58.110 --> 52:58.370]  Yeah.
[53:00.090 --> 53:01.670]  Hey, I'm headed to you guys.
[53:01.790 --> 53:03.830]  I got a little far behind.
[53:04.450 --> 53:05.690]  Oh, I wasn't paying attention.
[53:05.770 --> 53:06.790]  Accidentally ran into a camp.
[53:07.910 --> 53:08.570]  Can we...
[53:08.570 --> 53:10.050]  Is there a level up spot anywhere near us, Nick?
[53:10.210 --> 53:10.730]  I don't know.
[53:10.730 --> 53:11.490]  Yeah, this way.
[53:11.530 --> 53:12.150]  There's one near me.
[53:13.430 --> 53:14.170]  Oh, let's go to Andrew.
[53:15.810 --> 53:16.490]  He's in trouble.
[53:16.970 --> 53:18.950]  Rains gather, pretending the tide of night.
[53:19.070 --> 53:19.570]  Geoff's in trouble.
[53:19.570 --> 53:20.490]  We got to go to the tree.
[53:22.210 --> 53:23.050]  Oh, tree's kind of close.
[53:23.170 --> 53:24.050]  What the hell are these things?
[53:27.730 --> 53:28.150]  All right.
[53:29.630 --> 53:30.430]  Fuck off.
[53:31.050 --> 53:31.650]  Oh, I missed.
[53:31.870 --> 53:32.450]  Kill them all.
[53:32.630 --> 53:33.370]  Just lock onto it.
[53:36.190 --> 53:36.650]  It's dead.
[53:36.810 --> 53:36.970]  All right.
[53:39.130 --> 53:39.950]  Oh, no.
[53:42.330 --> 53:43.630]  Oh, that thing's waiting.
[53:46.010 --> 53:49.310]  Oh, the tree is by the dude who kicked our ass.
[53:50.690 --> 53:51.090]  That's...
[53:51.090 --> 53:51.790]  I don't like that.
[53:52.390 --> 53:53.190]  You guys going up there?
[53:54.790 --> 53:56.890]  Uh, I'm coming up to where Andrew is.
[53:56.950 --> 53:57.590]  I'm fighting a boss.
[53:59.110 --> 54:00.370]  That is very killable.
[54:02.590 --> 54:03.350]  Just like us.
[54:04.690 --> 54:05.390]  That is...
[54:05.390 --> 54:06.070]  Bosses, not...
[54:06.070 --> 54:06.630]  Not killable.
[54:06.710 --> 54:07.090]  We're bosses.
[54:07.830 --> 54:09.830]  Oh, that is the opposite of what I took from the statement.
[54:10.710 --> 54:10.970]  Yeah.
[54:12.150 --> 54:12.550]  Oh.
[54:13.810 --> 54:14.990]  I guess we gotta kill all the knights.
[54:16.530 --> 54:16.930]  Oh.
[54:18.710 --> 54:19.330]  Guys, wait.
[54:20.310 --> 54:21.130]  I don't wanna kill.
[54:22.930 --> 54:24.110]  I don't wanna kill.
[54:24.130 --> 54:24.730]  Where else are we missing?
[54:25.470 --> 54:26.510]  Oh, over here.
[54:27.090 --> 54:28.470]  Circle's kind of closing in fast.
[54:28.550 --> 54:32.070]  We should start thinking about leaving, unfortunately.
[54:40.800 --> 54:42.480]  This guy is a little dickhead.
[54:42.620 --> 54:43.440]  All right, should we leave?
[54:45.400 --> 54:48.630]  Oh, boy.
[54:48.690 --> 54:49.190]  Not just yet.
[54:50.130 --> 54:51.350]  Yeah, it's time to go.
[54:51.390 --> 54:51.670]  Oh, yeah.
[54:51.810 --> 54:52.510]  It's time to go.
[54:52.510 --> 54:52.950]  Time to go.
[54:55.430 --> 54:56.210]  I've seen enough.
[54:56.450 --> 54:57.890]  You didn't wanna fight the big balrog guy?
[54:57.990 --> 54:58.850]  We don't have time.
[54:59.190 --> 55:00.210]  The fire is here.
[55:00.630 --> 55:01.390]  Oh, the fire's here.
[55:05.210 --> 55:05.610]  Go!
[55:09.290 --> 55:09.970]  I really wish...
[55:09.970 --> 55:10.570]  We didn't upgrade.
[55:10.950 --> 55:11.270]  We're fucked.
[55:11.510 --> 55:13.810]  Yeah, I would love to have leveled.
[55:15.990 --> 55:17.030]  Is there one on the way?
[55:17.230 --> 55:17.630]  No.
[55:19.010 --> 55:19.950]  There's one south.
[55:22.510 --> 55:23.510]  We'll never make it, will we?
[55:23.710 --> 55:24.670]  No, it's already covered.
[55:25.750 --> 55:26.110]  Fuck.
[55:26.890 --> 55:27.250]  Shit.
[55:28.110 --> 55:28.470]  Balls.
[55:29.190 --> 55:29.950]  Fuck, shit, balls.
[55:30.690 --> 55:32.010]  Oh, my God, it's 454.
[55:32.190 --> 55:33.190]  Where did the hour go?
[55:33.250 --> 55:34.970]  I know, I just looked at it.
[55:35.630 --> 55:36.690]  God, I feel so bad.
[55:36.770 --> 55:39.450]  I feel like we've hardly ever even talked to the chat today.
[55:40.110 --> 55:40.550]  We didn't.
[55:40.550 --> 55:40.930]  Chat's here.
[55:41.090 --> 55:41.250]  Hello?
[55:44.550 --> 55:45.810]  Audience, I love you so much.
[55:45.890 --> 55:48.150]  I wish I could read your words right now.
[55:48.390 --> 55:49.070]  I never use the phone.
[55:49.070 --> 55:50.150]  We appreciate you so much.
[55:50.650 --> 55:52.750]  Unfortunately, I love my two compatriots here.
[55:52.850 --> 55:54.930]  And if I split my focus, they'll die on the battlefield.
[55:55.090 --> 55:56.950]  And I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life.
[55:57.970 --> 55:58.110]  Oh.
[56:01.890 --> 56:02.690]  All right.
[56:05.070 --> 56:07.050]  I feel like we're doing really good damage.
[56:07.530 --> 56:09.390]  I'm happy with our damage situation at the moment.
[56:10.250 --> 56:12.610]  Oh, I don't like this wizard guy.
[56:14.490 --> 56:14.890]  Wizard.
[56:15.510 --> 56:19.750]  Oh, this guy is not dying quickly.
[56:20.150 --> 56:21.210]  Good job, Geoff.
[56:21.770 --> 56:22.050]  Thank you.
[56:23.470 --> 56:26.430]  I think something with the circle, probably.
[56:27.610 --> 56:28.570]  Or is that our circle?
[56:29.530 --> 56:30.050]  That's ours.
[56:31.350 --> 56:33.070]  This is the heliocircle, isn't it?
[56:33.110 --> 56:33.830]  Ow, prick.
[56:34.990 --> 56:35.150]  Oh.
[56:41.960 --> 56:42.480]  Huh.
[56:42.840 --> 56:43.360]  Ow!
[56:43.720 --> 56:44.240]  Fuck!
[56:45.280 --> 56:46.820]  What a piece of shit.
[56:48.020 --> 56:49.520]  I was almost fully healed.
[56:49.860 --> 56:50.120]  You're an asshole.
[56:50.600 --> 56:51.000]  I'm down.
[56:51.180 --> 56:51.940]  Oh, what a dick.
[56:51.940 --> 56:52.340]  I got you.
[56:52.340 --> 56:52.760]  Dick.
[56:53.640 --> 56:54.160]  Let's go.
[56:54.300 --> 56:55.600]  All right.
[56:55.840 --> 56:56.440]  Here comes boss.
[56:56.540 --> 56:57.640]  Oh, my God.
[56:58.060 --> 56:59.020]  Oh, we're in trouble.
[57:02.910 --> 57:03.630]  Oh, shit.
[57:03.850 --> 57:04.750]  Oh, I'm down already.
[57:04.870 --> 57:05.230]  Fuck me.
[57:05.270 --> 57:05.710]  I'm dumb.
[57:06.450 --> 57:07.310]  Somebody help me, please.
[57:07.630 --> 57:07.830]  Yeah.
[57:10.090 --> 57:11.370]  Oh, we might be boned.
[57:12.590 --> 57:13.910]  Oh, we're definitely boned.
[57:15.830 --> 57:17.030]  Oh, I'm down.
[57:17.130 --> 57:17.630]  I'm trying to get you.
[57:18.050 --> 57:19.190]  God damn, dude.
[57:19.350 --> 57:19.790]  On my way.
[57:20.830 --> 57:21.390]  Thank you.
[57:21.970 --> 57:22.250]  Nice.
[57:22.330 --> 57:23.670]  They're stomping on us.
[57:25.490 --> 57:25.850]  Oh.
[57:26.230 --> 57:27.130]  Oh, fuck me.
[57:27.190 --> 57:28.010]  I'm down again.
[57:28.370 --> 57:28.730]  Shit.
[57:31.650 --> 57:32.650]  I'm working on you, Nick.
[57:32.790 --> 57:33.610]  Yeah, we got you.
[57:33.730 --> 57:38.690]  Okay, I'm gonna fall back for a second, see if we can't use some shit to our advantage.
[57:38.910 --> 57:39.110]  Yeah.
[57:39.890 --> 57:40.570]  All right, here we go.
[57:41.670 --> 57:42.030]  Fuck.
[57:43.630 --> 57:44.470]  Well, that did nothing.
[57:44.590 --> 57:45.430]  Nick, congratulations.
[57:48.010 --> 57:48.370]  Wow.
[57:48.990 --> 57:51.230]  Ah, these little pricks.
[57:52.790 --> 57:53.110]  Heal up.
[57:54.610 --> 57:55.610]  Okay, roll away.
[57:59.950 --> 58:00.670]  There we go.
[58:01.470 --> 58:02.750]  Put a hurtin' on this guy.
[58:03.570 --> 58:06.590]  I think this one is close to death, maybe?
[58:06.730 --> 58:07.670]  Oh, he's down.
[58:08.450 --> 58:09.170]  Definitely close.
[58:10.610 --> 58:11.330]  He's one hit.
[58:11.630 --> 58:12.150]  He's dead.
[58:12.230 --> 58:13.010]  Okay, we got one of them.
[58:13.490 --> 58:17.050]  But I have such low health and I'm out of flasks now.
[58:20.770 --> 58:21.290]  What does this do?
[58:21.390 --> 58:21.810]  What does this do?
[58:21.870 --> 58:22.350]  What does this do?
[58:22.850 --> 58:23.210]  Okay.
[58:23.430 --> 58:23.970]  I got you, Nick.
[58:24.070 --> 58:24.550]  I'm covering you.
[58:24.890 --> 58:25.230]  Thank you.
[58:25.230 --> 58:25.310]  Okay.
[58:26.990 --> 58:28.290]  Okay, his horse is down.
[58:29.450 --> 58:30.470]  Fuck him up while he's down.
[58:30.870 --> 58:31.010]  Ah!
[58:31.990 --> 58:33.070]  That's such a bad attack.
[58:33.230 --> 58:33.450]  Uh-oh.
[58:33.610 --> 58:33.690]  Fuck.
[58:38.530 --> 58:39.190]  Just fuck him.
[58:39.910 --> 58:40.170]  There's a healing stone.
[58:40.170 --> 58:42.010]  What was that? Was that a ghost horse that went after him?
[58:42.090 --> 58:42.190]  What was that?
[58:42.550 --> 58:43.150]  Firepots at him.
[58:46.310 --> 58:46.630]  Nice.
[58:46.670 --> 58:47.530]  Go over here and heal up.
[58:47.590 --> 58:49.330]  Yeah, I need that health so bad.
[58:49.590 --> 58:50.710]  Yeah, come over here. I'll cover us.
[58:53.590 --> 58:54.090]  Oh, well.
[58:56.730 --> 58:57.110]  Fucking prick.
[58:57.110 --> 58:58.010]  Great heal.
[58:58.230 --> 58:59.530]  Stand still, asshole.
[59:05.290 --> 59:06.390]  That's for you, dickhead.
[59:06.630 --> 59:07.070]  Whoa!
[59:07.730 --> 59:08.510]  Big attack.
[59:08.930 --> 59:09.410]  Nice.
[59:09.550 --> 59:10.930]  Lots of damage.
[59:11.690 --> 59:12.770]  Kill the horse.
[59:13.430 --> 59:13.830]  Oh!
[59:14.470 --> 59:15.410]  Get him on the ground.
[59:15.490 --> 59:16.050]  There you go.
[59:16.270 --> 59:17.270]  And we almost got him halfway.
[59:17.510 --> 59:18.650]  Fuck his world up.
[59:19.130 --> 59:19.610]  Shit.
[59:19.870 --> 59:20.110]  Oh!
[59:20.270 --> 59:20.970]  Oh, shit!
[59:22.170 --> 59:22.990]  We're all down.
[59:23.070 --> 59:23.510]  I'm down.
[59:23.910 --> 59:24.670]  Yeah, I'm working on you.
[59:24.690 --> 59:25.510]  He's got a ghost horse.
[59:26.030 --> 59:26.830]  What is that?
[59:29.110 --> 59:31.730]  Okay, we're working on you, Nick.
[59:32.350 --> 59:34.350]  You may not be able to get me, and I understand.
[59:34.650 --> 59:35.610]  No, no. We're going to get you.
[59:37.110 --> 59:37.630]  One more.
[59:38.210 --> 59:39.170]  One more hit. There you go.
[59:39.190 --> 59:39.830]  Oh, you got me!
[59:40.010 --> 59:41.490]  Okay, we're both down.
[59:43.330 --> 59:43.690]  Oh!
[59:44.910 --> 59:45.270]  Oh!
[59:47.210 --> 59:47.590]  Damn it!
[59:49.450 --> 59:51.070]  Fucking tree sentinel every time.
[59:51.390 --> 59:51.990]  Oh, my god.
[59:52.010 --> 59:53.010]  We got close, though.
[59:53.350 --> 59:56.730]  We're 59. Only one minute plus one minute.
[59:56.730 --> 59:59.290]  To the best time of the week, 5.01.
[59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.410]  Just to hang out with our chat for a few minutes.
[01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.330]  Some would say two minutes.
[01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.470]  Oh, we got a lot of good shit, though, from that run.
[01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:07.070]  That was good.
[01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.970]  It's a good shit run right there.
[01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.590]  Oh, I love a good shit run.
[01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:16.430]  Wonder if anybody in the world has made it to level three, and I'm going to guess not.
[01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:17.670]  Impossible.
[01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:19.710]  Go ahead and fuck with a relic.
[01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:22.050]  Bet you there's an achievement for it, and it's at zero percent.
[01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:26.710]  Critical hits earn runes.
[01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:31.890]  I have a pretty sweet rune.
[01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.610]  Polished burning scene.
[01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:36.390]  Polished burning scene.
[01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:37.390]  It's the same fucking thing.
[01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:38.750]  Well, it's not the same.
[01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:39.710]  This one has extra vigor.
[01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.050]  Maybe I'll try running with somebody else.
[01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:43.930]  How do you know which one's better than the other?
[01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:45.770]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:49.750]  I think it's understanding, like, how you play and what would be more useful.
[01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.350]  Well, guess what?
[01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:52.950]  I don't understand how I play.
[01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:59.490]  I don't play well, but I feel like as a team, we're pretty decent.
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:00.990]  Boys, it's five o'clock.
[01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:05.110]  501 is right around the corner.
[01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.830]  Best time of the week.
[01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:10.750]  The moment that we're all here to celebrate, as well as just the success of another week
[01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:11.350]  under our belts.
[01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.190]  Let's spend that last minute with the audience.
[01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.530]  Anybody have a question in the last minute?
[01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.130]  Anybody want a concern?
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:18.210]  Yeah.
[01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:19.730]  Can we raid Matt?
[01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:21.270]  I assume we can raid Matt.
[01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.810]  Absolutely.
[01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:22.470]  Let's raid Matt.
[01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.210]  I don't know how to do that, but I know somebody will.
[01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.730]  What's his...
[01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.630]  Axiomat.
[01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:28.710]  Axiomat.
[01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:31.730]  Type it out.
[01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.110]  A-X-I-A-L-M-A-T-T.
[01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.330]  Yeah.
[01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:35.850]  Thanks for the sub, East Coast Eagle.
[01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:37.350]  Oh, thank you so much.
[01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:41.810]  And thanks for not stirring up any East Coast, West Coast bad blood today.
[01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.570]  Everybody.
[01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:44.110]  501!
[01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:49.650]  Can you believe it?
[01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.330]  Can you believe it happened?
[01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:54.010]  We survived another regulation week.
[01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:55.710]  Congratulations to everybody in the chat.
[01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.030]  Congratulations to my co-workers.
[01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.490]  The ones that bothered to show up for work today.
[01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:02.950]  Boy, did we get a lot done.
[01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:05.130]  This was a very productive week.
[01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:07.950]  And not to call anybody out, but to the two who are on vacation.
[01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:09.490]  Did you really deserve it?
[01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:11.190]  No, of course they did.
[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.810]  They work very hard.
[01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:12.910]  Yes, they do.
[01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:13.990]  Food for thought, though.
[01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:19.150]  All right, let's raid Matt and we'll see y'all next time.
[01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:20.230]  Love you.
