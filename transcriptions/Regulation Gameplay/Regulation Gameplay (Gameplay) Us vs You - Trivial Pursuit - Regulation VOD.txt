[00:00.000 --> 00:01.140]  Andrew, what are we doing?
[00:01.180 --> 00:03.620]  We're playing Trivia Pursuit 2 against the community.
[00:04.380 --> 00:06.340]  Oh, great. That's fantastic.
[00:06.660 --> 00:10.900]  So there's Andrew, Gavin and myself against the viewers.
[00:11.260 --> 00:14.300]  And Geoff is also here, who will be helping?
[00:14.600 --> 00:20.120]  Yeah, I'm going to sub in and play against whoever is the dumbest idiot,
[00:20.180 --> 00:24.560]  as long as it's not Eric or the viewers, in which case I will replace
[00:24.560 --> 00:27.400]  whoever's dumber between Gavin and Andrew next round, I guess.
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.600]  Right, right.
[00:28.860 --> 00:30.440]  Well, I think the audience should be on the line.
[00:30.540 --> 00:32.480]  I think if the audience loses, they do have to leave.
[00:32.700 --> 00:33.920]  Yeah, kick the audience out, Geoff.
[00:34.100 --> 00:36.060]  All right, let's do it. Fuck the audience.
[00:36.840 --> 00:37.820]  Yeah, I mean, I love the audience.
[00:37.880 --> 00:38.940]  Only if they lose.
[00:39.300 --> 00:40.080]  Only if they lose.
[00:40.460 --> 00:41.740]  I'd be blown away by it.
[00:41.820 --> 00:44.120]  Yes, it's almost certainly not going to happen.
[00:45.000 --> 00:45.760]  Yeah, we'll see.
[00:45.980 --> 00:47.880]  It's hundreds of brains against two.
[00:48.320 --> 00:48.520]  Yeah.
[00:51.240 --> 00:52.420]  Let's do some emojis.
[00:52.840 --> 00:54.100]  I'm an evil little guy.
[00:54.880 --> 00:56.200]  Yeah, we're going to want to see...
[00:56.200 --> 00:59.200]  Speaking of emojis, we're going to want to see some piss rats in the chat
[00:59.200 --> 01:00.120]  if we could go ahead and get that.
[01:00.120 --> 01:00.780]  I don't know about that.
[01:01.160 --> 01:05.700]  Go ahead and get as many of those, just spam those those piss rats if you can.
[01:05.800 --> 01:06.720]  Yeah, no, it's fine.
[01:07.040 --> 01:09.320]  Yeah, if you've joined as a part of the audience,
[01:09.480 --> 01:11.620]  make sure you leave some piss in the chat.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.240]  This is me when I missed three Beetlejuices last night.
[01:16.220 --> 01:17.020]  Oh, no.
[01:18.160 --> 01:19.120]  You missed three?
[01:19.680 --> 01:20.560]  There are apparently three.
[01:22.820 --> 01:23.540]  That's great.
[01:24.760 --> 01:25.780]  Oh, there we go.
[01:26.200 --> 01:27.420]  Here we go.
[01:28.100 --> 01:30.460]  Andrew, the audience wants to know how they play as the audience.
[01:30.560 --> 01:31.200]  How do they do that?
[01:31.580 --> 01:34.360]  I believe it'll give a prompt.
[01:34.540 --> 01:35.780]  Let's take a look at the rules.
[01:36.120 --> 01:36.380]  Where?
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.880]  Once the questions start, the correct answers score you points.
[01:40.060 --> 01:40.360]  There you go.
[01:41.580 --> 01:43.040]  This is explaining how to play.
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.400]  I'm an evil little guy.
[01:45.880 --> 01:47.340]  You're the evil little grumpy little man.
[01:47.900 --> 01:48.600]  I'm a little guy.
[01:48.800 --> 01:49.720]  I'm a mean little guy.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.120]  Grumpy old kid.
[01:51.860 --> 01:52.700]  Sports and leisure.
[01:53.640 --> 01:54.100]  Whoa.
[01:54.480 --> 01:54.900]  Whoa.
[01:55.820 --> 01:57.620]  Oh, my God.
[01:58.540 --> 02:02.780]  Uh, yeah, uh, uh, I locked in, but I don't know.
[02:03.120 --> 02:04.120]  I think I got it wrong.
[02:05.440 --> 02:07.500]  Does he see all the names?
[02:07.680 --> 02:08.760]  They fly up.
[02:09.180 --> 02:09.820]  Wow.
[02:10.380 --> 02:13.920]  How confident in you guys are your answer?
[02:14.740 --> 02:16.540]  I feel pretty good.
[02:16.920 --> 02:18.400]  Snowboarding was the latest.
[02:18.580 --> 02:19.700]  It has to snowboard.
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.240]  No.
[02:21.280 --> 02:24.220]  Snow was invented way before tarmac.
[02:25.500 --> 02:26.280]  It's tough.
[02:26.460 --> 02:28.260]  Snow came way before Tony Hawk.
[02:28.480 --> 02:28.640]  Nailed it.
[02:28.800 --> 02:29.780]  It was definitely snowboarding.
[02:31.060 --> 02:31.500]  Shit.
[02:33.060 --> 02:33.400]  I got it.
[02:33.620 --> 02:36.100]  Snowboarding happened in like the late 70s, early 80s.
[02:36.220 --> 02:36.580]  Yeah.
[02:37.200 --> 02:37.920]  I remember.
[02:38.040 --> 02:38.740]  OK, here we go.
[02:38.980 --> 02:40.220]  James Bond popularized it.
[02:43.440 --> 02:44.320]  Oh, fuck.
[02:45.040 --> 02:45.300]  Rain Man.
[02:45.460 --> 02:46.000]  It's Rain Man.
[02:46.520 --> 02:47.060]  Oh, it's Rain Man?
[02:47.180 --> 02:47.360]  Good.
[02:48.780 --> 02:49.220]  Magnolia.
[02:49.680 --> 02:50.320]  Oh, no.
[02:50.680 --> 02:51.280]  Oh, no.
[02:51.340 --> 02:51.880]  The viewers.
[02:52.080 --> 02:52.540]  Oh, no.
[02:52.540 --> 02:54.980]  Oh, no, that's good.
[02:55.060 --> 03:00.860]  We got a couple of Rain Man in there, a couple of Rain Men, three Rain Men flying in there.
[03:00.980 --> 03:02.140]  Shout out to the Rain Men.
[03:04.740 --> 03:06.100]  Hey, hey, audience.
[03:06.240 --> 03:09.940]  How many of y'all were here last night for Sloppy Halloween?
[03:11.380 --> 03:12.820]  Oh, yeah, it was a great one.
[03:13.060 --> 03:13.900]  It was a really good one.
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.240]  Eric and I were talking this morning.
[03:15.380 --> 03:16.160]  We were getting coffee.
[03:16.200 --> 03:20.360]  We were saying that it might be definitely the sloppiest one we've done, but maybe the most fun we've had.
[03:20.360 --> 03:22.280]  It was definitely the most fun.
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.340]  Ooh, a lot of me's.
[03:23.540 --> 03:24.720]  A lot, a lot of people were here.
[03:25.260 --> 03:30.100]  Don't worry, if you missed it, there will be a VOD released sometime in the next week or so.
[03:30.220 --> 03:32.680]  Hey, James, I think soon we'll have enough for a compilation.
[03:33.020 --> 03:33.100]  Oh, wow.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.940]  What's the longest snake to ever be kept in captivity?
[03:40.120 --> 03:40.820]  Man, fuck that.
[03:40.960 --> 03:42.060]  That is a stupid question.
[03:43.260 --> 03:44.060]  I don't...
[03:44.060 --> 03:45.300]  That's a stupid question.
[03:45.480 --> 03:46.580]  That's a stupid snake.
[03:46.720 --> 03:47.880]  That's a stupid snake owner.
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.540]  I locked in, but I don't know how confident I am with green anaconda.
[03:52.700 --> 03:55.320]  I feel like green anaconda is a smaller snake, maybe.
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.200]  Oh, I think they're big.
[03:56.820 --> 03:57.340]  Are they?
[03:57.340 --> 03:57.720]  Shit.
[03:58.060 --> 03:58.800]  I think it's probably going to be bigger.
[03:58.820 --> 04:00.260]  See, I think anaconda...
[04:01.320 --> 04:02.920]  Anaconda is there to throw us.
[04:03.140 --> 04:03.740]  That's bullshit.
[04:05.540 --> 04:07.140]  I was tricked by the blood orchid.
[04:09.760 --> 04:12.880]  Who were the first Europeans to colonize the state of New York?
[04:13.760 --> 04:14.960]  Oh, oh, interesting.
[04:15.180 --> 04:16.020]  I know the answer to that.
[04:16.820 --> 04:17.600]  Do you really?
[04:17.600 --> 04:18.540]  Uh-huh.
[04:19.140 --> 04:21.080]  It used to have a different name, didn't it?
[04:21.660 --> 04:21.880]  Uh-huh.
[04:22.220 --> 04:23.300]  Was it Old York?
[04:23.680 --> 04:23.980]  Nope.
[04:24.240 --> 04:25.000]  Original York?
[04:25.280 --> 04:25.920]  Original York's in England.
[04:25.920 --> 04:27.120]  I really regret my...
[04:27.120 --> 04:27.500]  Yes.
[04:27.760 --> 04:27.980]  Oh.
[04:28.100 --> 04:30.300]  I believe it was New Amsterdam.
[04:31.280 --> 04:33.180]  Oh, even Old New York?
[04:33.380 --> 04:34.240]  Oh, fuck.
[04:34.260 --> 04:35.420]  That was once New Amsterdam?
[04:36.400 --> 04:37.300]  Why'd they change it?
[04:37.320 --> 04:38.160]  I can't...
[04:38.160 --> 04:41.840]  Maybe they liked it better that way.
[04:41.940 --> 04:42.460]  I get it.
[04:43.120 --> 04:44.600]  Try and learn your country's history.
[04:45.000 --> 04:45.480]  Ooh.
[04:45.780 --> 04:47.100]  No, I don't think so.
[04:47.160 --> 04:47.420]  I'm good.
[04:47.420 --> 04:47.720]  Okay.
[04:48.520 --> 04:49.880]  I'm an evil little guy.
[04:50.080 --> 04:51.040]  Oh, give me.
[04:51.620 --> 04:53.620]  Might be the most hypocritical thing Gavin's ever said.
[04:54.320 --> 04:54.420]  Yeah.
[04:58.220 --> 04:59.020]  That's pretty funny.
[05:02.240 --> 05:02.680]  What?
[05:02.920 --> 05:03.780]  Oh, hell yeah.
[05:05.140 --> 05:07.100]  I have a piece of art by this person.
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.400]  Do you really?
[05:08.640 --> 05:09.620]  Yes, he does.
[05:09.720 --> 05:10.340]  That's cool.
[05:11.580 --> 05:12.100]  Very cool.
[05:12.320 --> 05:12.720]  Okay, I got...
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.780]  I mean, I got it wrong.
[05:15.200 --> 05:17.320]  Clearly based on the amount of people voting.
[05:17.320 --> 05:18.680]  I did not get it right.
[05:18.740 --> 05:20.620]  Is that shark in Vegas now?
[05:21.360 --> 05:22.320]  Isn't that a hotel in Vegas?
[05:22.520 --> 05:22.680]  I don't know.
[05:22.840 --> 05:25.840]  I remember it started to rot, even though it was in formaldehyde.
[05:25.880 --> 05:26.280]  Really?
[05:27.040 --> 05:30.900]  And then he wrote, uh, Damien was here on my overalls once.
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.040]  Oh, that's cool.
[05:32.680 --> 05:33.800]  I've never heard of this.
[05:33.900 --> 05:34.780]  I don't know anything about it.
[05:37.420 --> 05:38.240]  He's like the...
[05:38.240 --> 05:38.880]  Gavin got a little piece.
[05:41.160 --> 05:44.080]  Probably two or three most successful artists in the world right now, I'd say.
[05:45.220 --> 05:48.580]  I'm not an art guy, and I don't know anything about our history, so, too bad.
[05:49.100 --> 05:49.940]  I'll do something about it.
[05:50.220 --> 05:50.940]  Sports, though.
[05:53.580 --> 05:54.700]  How do we skip this?
[05:54.780 --> 05:56.440]  Oh, we can't because the audience is playing, huh?
[05:56.460 --> 05:56.820]  There we go.
[05:56.900 --> 05:57.620]  No, we can't.
[05:57.700 --> 05:58.560]  No, you just gotta skip.
[05:59.200 --> 06:01.760]  No, you just gotta wait until the instructions pop up.
[06:02.480 --> 06:05.120]  You were trying to skip it before it was even skippable.
[06:05.740 --> 06:06.380]  It said skip.
[06:06.520 --> 06:06.900]  I was skipping.
[06:09.860 --> 06:10.980]  Oh, we're synchronizing.
[06:11.780 --> 06:13.180]  Syncing with the audience.
[06:13.180 --> 06:13.880]  School's cold!
[06:20.030 --> 06:23.390]  A lot of people reminiscing in the chat about last night's handshake.
[06:24.330 --> 06:27.490]  Dude, I'm serious when I say I want that to be the intro to all of our videos.
[06:28.890 --> 06:30.030]  This is so funny.
[06:35.820 --> 06:36.200]  Ooh!
[06:38.900 --> 06:39.720]  Oh, shit.
[06:44.960 --> 06:45.260]  Hey!
[06:47.240 --> 06:47.680]  What's...
[06:47.680 --> 06:49.400]  Uh, I don't know what any of these are.
[06:50.180 --> 06:51.800]  I don't know what any of the...
[06:51.800 --> 06:54.280]  Other than AT&T Stadium, don't know what they are.
[06:54.380 --> 06:56.040]  New Camp is where, uh...
[06:56.040 --> 06:57.560]  Run Grotto 1st of May?
[06:58.000 --> 06:58.380]  What?
[06:58.720 --> 07:01.560]  New Camp is where Barcelona plays, I think.
[07:02.080 --> 07:02.340]  Ooh.
[07:02.420 --> 07:06.400]  Oh, it's bloody FNB.
[07:06.740 --> 07:07.640]  Oh, shit.
[07:08.700 --> 07:09.540]  What is FNB?
[07:09.760 --> 07:10.160]  I don't know.
[07:10.920 --> 07:11.500]  Oh, okay.
[07:14.440 --> 07:16.280]  I don't know how many...
[07:16.280 --> 07:17.220]  Oh, my God.
[07:18.680 --> 07:19.540]  Let's see.
[07:20.140 --> 07:20.560]  Oh!
[07:20.560 --> 07:22.140]  Yeah, and he was last!
[07:22.320 --> 07:23.160]  What the hell?
[07:23.360 --> 07:24.620]  No one voted with me.
[07:25.040 --> 07:25.340]  Yep.
[07:26.340 --> 07:27.740]  Oh, my God.
[07:27.920 --> 07:28.760]  I've never seen that happen.
[07:28.960 --> 07:29.180]  Crazy mode.
[07:29.940 --> 07:31.340]  Wow, is Gavin in first?
[07:33.120 --> 07:33.560]  Uh...
[07:33.560 --> 07:34.300]  Wow.
[07:34.580 --> 07:35.720]  Gavin's got two pieces already?
[07:35.900 --> 07:36.160]  Wow.
[07:41.300 --> 07:41.740]  Uh...
[07:41.740 --> 07:42.300]  Oh, man.
[07:46.200 --> 07:47.080]  Oh, man.
[07:47.520 --> 07:49.540]  If I get lost on this, it sucks.
[07:49.540 --> 07:50.380]  Yep, come on.
[07:51.640 --> 07:52.280]  Who's going?
[07:52.980 --> 07:54.060]  Oh, the audience, I don't think,
[07:54.060 --> 07:55.340]  realized it was their turn.
[07:55.420 --> 07:56.340]  No, like, they didn't.
[07:56.840 --> 07:57.140]  Pretty cool.
[07:59.060 --> 08:00.660]  Some of the audience going for...
[08:01.740 --> 08:02.300]  Yep.
[08:07.860 --> 08:09.580]  Oh, come on!
[08:10.300 --> 08:10.960]  Go ahead, buddy.
[08:11.880 --> 08:12.980]  Bloody hell.
[08:16.460 --> 08:17.580]  All right!
[08:18.500 --> 08:19.620]  Way to go, guys.
[08:20.600 --> 08:21.480]  Hey, I got a piece!
[08:21.800 --> 08:22.360]  Nice!
[08:23.340 --> 08:25.420]  Got forced into 600 points.
[08:26.020 --> 08:27.400]  We're all at two pieces.
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.180]  Look at that.
[08:28.260 --> 08:28.780]  Isn't that cool?
[08:31.440 --> 08:32.840]  Oh, no longer last.
[08:33.040 --> 08:33.400]  Hell yeah.
[08:33.960 --> 08:37.080]  You guys are pretty mentally evenly matched.
[08:38.700 --> 08:39.500]  Oh, God.
[08:39.720 --> 08:40.180]  Ooh.
[08:43.280 --> 08:44.840]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[08:45.600 --> 08:47.100]  Oh, I want to go first.
[08:47.560 --> 08:49.340]  I don't know what it is.
[08:50.080 --> 08:52.200]  Uh, largest museum by area?
[08:52.580 --> 08:53.480]  I bet I know.
[08:53.520 --> 08:53.900]  Yeah, sure.
[08:54.260 --> 08:55.100]  I don't know.
[08:55.100 --> 08:57.020]  I really legitimately just...
[08:57.020 --> 08:57.300]  I don't know.
[08:57.380 --> 08:58.120]  Let's just pick one.
[08:58.580 --> 08:58.980]  China's big.
[08:59.100 --> 09:00.260]  The Louvre is the one you've heard about.
[09:00.460 --> 09:00.860]  I don't know.
[09:00.960 --> 09:01.140]  Sure.
[09:01.380 --> 09:02.440]  It's maybe it's the Louvre.
[09:02.620 --> 09:03.400]  Is it that big?
[09:03.660 --> 09:04.620]  Oh, they're just spreading.
[09:05.840 --> 09:06.280]  I don't know.
[09:06.640 --> 09:07.060]  The chat...
[09:07.060 --> 09:08.840]  It appears the chat maybe doesn't know either,
[09:08.980 --> 09:10.260]  and they're going with the one they've heard of.
[09:10.400 --> 09:12.860]  I guessed four Vatican museums.
[09:12.960 --> 09:13.180]  Did you?
[09:14.200 --> 09:15.760]  Vatican is the smallest country.
[09:15.880 --> 09:17.320]  It'd be funny if it had the largest museum.
[09:17.460 --> 09:18.620]  That would be really cool.
[09:18.800 --> 09:19.480]  I've been there, dude.
[09:19.540 --> 09:20.240]  It's a lot of museum.
[09:22.920 --> 09:23.640]  You convinced...
[09:23.640 --> 09:24.600]  You convinced Andrew.
[09:24.600 --> 09:27.840]  I just don't feel like it'll be the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
[09:28.280 --> 09:29.380]  And I don't either.
[09:29.640 --> 09:30.700]  Let's see the correct order.
[09:32.100 --> 09:33.200]  Hey, it's the...
[09:33.200 --> 09:34.240]  It is the Louvre.
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.180]  Damn, it's a big place.
[09:36.580 --> 09:37.240]  I guess so.
[09:37.880 --> 09:38.820]  I was the most wrong.
[09:42.420 --> 09:44.680]  Geoff is going ham on his snack board.
[09:45.060 --> 09:46.420]  How about that?
[09:47.060 --> 09:49.020]  It's five correct answers in a row.
[09:49.460 --> 09:50.140]  Way to go, Gavin.
[09:52.280 --> 09:52.800]  Oh.
[09:54.760 --> 09:55.240]  Oh.
[09:57.860 --> 09:58.340]  Oh.
[09:59.240 --> 10:05.860]  You know, if there's one thing I know about Germany, outside of their Swiss army knife history, I love the metric system.
[10:06.140 --> 10:07.440]  I feel the same way about France.
[10:12.780 --> 10:13.880]  Suck it, Geoff.
[10:14.260 --> 10:15.180]  Okay, I'll suck it.
[10:15.920 --> 10:16.780]  Consider it sucked.
[10:20.700 --> 10:21.960]  Not the best sequel.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.420]  Chat all over the place on this one, I feel like.
[10:26.420 --> 10:29.720]  I like this. It's not obvious to just pick what chat picked.
[10:30.680 --> 10:33.340]  Uh, I'm picking Russia just because I picked it last time.
[10:33.520 --> 10:33.720]  Sure.
[10:36.580 --> 10:37.380]  Damn it.
[10:37.720 --> 10:38.900]  Ooh, Brazil.
[10:39.340 --> 10:40.560]  Locked in a fruit.
[10:42.480 --> 10:43.560]  And give me that piece.
[10:44.600 --> 10:46.960]  And the USA still haven't yet.
[10:47.440 --> 10:48.200]  Goddamn right.
[10:49.040 --> 10:50.220]  Any time now, though.
[10:50.480 --> 10:52.660]  Nah, we're still we're going to wear you guys down, baby.
[10:52.780 --> 10:53.180]  We're going to win.
[10:53.280 --> 10:54.820]  Yeah, I've got I got no problem with Imperial.
[10:55.240 --> 10:56.820]  Just three centuries behind.
[10:57.600 --> 10:59.920]  Yeah, we're going to be so far behind.
[11:00.100 --> 11:00.580]  We're ahead.
[11:01.280 --> 11:01.960]  Yeah, baby.
[11:02.200 --> 11:03.700]  Which of these celebrities became a guest?
[11:03.920 --> 11:04.880]  Oh, whoa.
[11:05.980 --> 11:07.140]  Holy shit.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.960]  Oh, thanks to T sentia for the 10 gifted subs.
[11:12.360 --> 11:12.960]  Hmm.
[11:16.830 --> 11:17.390]  First.
[11:17.910 --> 11:18.450]  Mm hmm.
[11:24.420 --> 11:25.860]  As a good guest.
[11:27.420 --> 11:29.480]  I just I was thinking X-Files.
[11:30.080 --> 11:30.780]  Yeah, definitely.
[11:30.780 --> 11:31.740]  That's what it was.
[11:31.920 --> 11:32.040]  Yeah.
[11:34.240 --> 11:36.440]  I don't remember who James Woods played.
[11:38.480 --> 11:39.000]  Himself.
[11:40.420 --> 11:46.340]  Is Bette Midler is in the Krusty the Clown episode where she sent where she sings
[11:46.340 --> 11:49.200]  Wind Beneath My Wings, I think.
[11:50.140 --> 11:52.720]  And I feel like that's relatively early.
[11:53.280 --> 11:54.940]  Betty White feels like later to me.
[11:55.420 --> 11:57.240]  James Woods, I don't remember in the show at all.
[11:58.380 --> 12:02.540]  Oh, I feel like I think I think it's Paul McCartney.
[12:03.140 --> 12:04.440]  Oh, it is Bette Midler.
[12:04.800 --> 12:05.240]  Yeah.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.160]  Don't send in the clowns.
[12:09.200 --> 12:14.860]  Season 11 is disrespectful to white because I don't remember the Betty White
[12:14.860 --> 12:19.920]  episode necessarily because it looks like the way I remember the Simpsons looking
[12:19.920 --> 12:20.900]  when I didn't like it.
[12:21.580 --> 12:24.700]  The James Woods one kind of makes sense, though, because that's the last time he
[12:24.700 --> 12:25.280]  was relevant.
[12:26.020 --> 12:26.460]  Sure.
[12:27.720 --> 12:28.760]  Final round.
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.780]  I'm an evil little guy in the lead.
[12:34.760 --> 12:36.400]  Whoa, rapid.
[12:36.660 --> 12:38.840]  Dude, how do we do rapid fire with the audience?
[12:39.740 --> 12:41.200]  Get your keyboard ready, I guess.
[12:41.660 --> 12:42.160]  Wow.
[12:42.560 --> 12:45.480]  Remember, first to six wedges wins the game.
[12:45.760 --> 12:46.060]  OK.
[12:50.470 --> 12:51.690]  Oh, it's not that rapid.
[12:51.910 --> 12:52.590]  Just one or the other.
[12:57.530 --> 13:01.130]  Like saying a shootout isn't fast because there's only two options.
[13:01.370 --> 13:04.290]  Well, just because there's that grab bag mode, which is pretty damn rapid.
[13:04.550 --> 13:05.430]  That is rapid.
[13:05.550 --> 13:05.750]  Yeah.
[13:07.630 --> 13:08.510]  Here we go.
[13:08.530 --> 13:10.450]  Movies and games, food and fun.
[13:10.810 --> 13:12.590]  It's time for sports and leisure.
[13:12.930 --> 13:13.050]  Woo.
[13:13.670 --> 13:14.930]  What are you talking about?
[13:15.110 --> 13:15.610]  Oh, man.
[13:15.710 --> 13:17.950]  I don't I don't know off the top of my head.
[13:18.550 --> 13:20.030]  Raccoon McCoy, thanks for the 10 gifts and stuff.
[13:20.030 --> 13:21.550]  I think it's is it the bronca?
[13:21.670 --> 13:22.210]  I don't dude.
[13:22.210 --> 13:23.290]  I don't know off the top of my head.
[13:23.390 --> 13:24.770]  I think I guess it's the Broncos.
[13:24.890 --> 13:25.650]  I picked the Cowboys.
[13:26.630 --> 13:27.910]  I don't feel good about it.
[13:28.710 --> 13:30.610]  The audience seems to think it's the Broncos.
[13:30.890 --> 13:32.150]  I think they're probably right.
[13:34.030 --> 13:35.090]  Is it the Broncos, Geoff?
[13:35.550 --> 13:36.610]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Broncos.
[13:37.810 --> 13:40.050]  It's just like Jerry got in there pretty early.
[13:40.410 --> 13:41.570]  And until the next category.
[13:44.970 --> 13:47.630]  Fuck, OK, Jerry did get in there pretty early.
[13:49.270 --> 13:50.270]  Am I even playing?
[13:50.910 --> 13:53.150]  No, no, because we because we lost the first question.
[13:53.350 --> 13:57.030]  Yeah, that question may as well have been, what is the best shmur?
[13:57.610 --> 13:58.990]  A glim or a flunk?
[14:12.850 --> 14:15.690]  All right, Andrew, you got this show, show who's boss, bud.
[14:16.810 --> 14:18.150]  Show me that. Oh, God.
[14:18.510 --> 14:20.090]  I mean, dude, clearly.
[14:20.290 --> 14:25.250]  I mean, every other it's like here's a hyper specific question to start.
[14:25.250 --> 14:28.750]  The rest will just be insanely easy. Awesome.
[14:30.710 --> 14:32.950]  Still going for the Broncos, though.
[14:35.030 --> 14:41.290]  Who? Who won a bunch in the 90s?
[14:41.770 --> 14:46.350]  Like it. Whose logo is a horse?
[14:48.940 --> 14:50.990]  I still don't know the answers to anything you say.
[14:52.130 --> 14:53.990]  This this sucks.
[14:58.800 --> 14:59.980]  Also easy. I don't know this.
[15:00.860 --> 15:03.220]  Yes. You don't know this, really?
[15:03.500 --> 15:04.400]  No, I have no idea.
[15:05.300 --> 15:06.480]  Oh, he's Tom Landry.
[15:06.680 --> 15:10.600]  Tom Landry is like the most famous figure of this team.
[15:10.760 --> 15:12.260]  Like, yes, I don't know.
[15:12.420 --> 15:14.620]  The most storied person.
[15:14.880 --> 15:17.400]  So, yeah, it's it's the Cowboys, baby.
[15:17.620 --> 15:18.300]  It's Tom's team.
[15:18.500 --> 15:20.180]  Each category is worth a wedge.
[15:20.260 --> 15:20.700]  Clungus.
[15:22.780 --> 15:25.160]  All right, Gavin, me and you, we're coming back.
[15:25.220 --> 15:25.940]  You're science and nature.
[15:25.940 --> 15:28.300]  Next up is science and nature.
[15:28.360 --> 15:29.760]  I'm losing. I'm the dumbest idiot.
[15:32.380 --> 15:33.560]  Oh, my God.
[15:34.100 --> 15:34.960]  Oh, shit.
[15:35.160 --> 15:36.100]  Use your zoo powers.
[15:36.420 --> 15:37.380]  Your zoo history, Eric.
[15:38.560 --> 15:40.520]  I don't god damn idiot know, do I?
[15:40.580 --> 15:43.000]  This feels like it's going to be a trick.
[15:43.680 --> 15:44.680]  Oh, my God.
[15:44.680 --> 15:46.140]  It feels like it's going to be a trick.
[15:48.100 --> 15:48.980]  I don't.
[15:50.800 --> 15:51.940]  Why would red?
[15:53.740 --> 15:54.960]  It has to be giant.
[15:54.960 --> 15:56.240]  Yeah, that's what I'm feeling.
[15:56.340 --> 16:01.140]  Yeah. Oh, God, we're all still in trick.
[16:01.280 --> 16:02.000]  We're all in. Oh, my God.
[16:08.580 --> 16:10.340]  They they had a red panda.
[16:10.840 --> 16:14.660]  And then the main panda came out and they called that one a giant panda.
[16:18.360 --> 16:20.620]  The panda was red already.
[16:22.500 --> 16:24.480]  So so why wasn't it called a panda?
[16:24.680 --> 16:25.580]  Yeah. Why wasn't it called a panda?
[16:25.580 --> 16:29.080]  Or if they went to the trouble of calling it red panda.
[16:29.780 --> 16:30.840]  Thought I hit X.
[16:31.060 --> 16:34.300]  Why the fuck wouldn't they differentiate the color on the other one?
[16:34.360 --> 16:36.780]  They're like, the only thing there's two things different about this panda.
[16:37.300 --> 16:38.820]  A, it's giant.
[16:39.120 --> 16:41.600]  And B, it's a totally different color scheme.
[16:42.440 --> 16:44.080]  It's really weird.
[16:44.940 --> 16:48.060]  It's really weird that if you
[16:50.780 --> 16:54.080]  like to call the first one, this is the red panda.
[16:55.580 --> 16:56.920]  What color is this other one?
[16:57.140 --> 16:57.760]  He's big.
[16:58.520 --> 17:01.020]  Yeah, well, this is black and white.
[17:01.340 --> 17:02.440]  Why don't you call the black and white panda?
[17:02.520 --> 17:03.540]  Because he's the big panda.
[17:03.920 --> 17:05.560]  Yeah. Lost it again.
[17:06.200 --> 17:08.920]  This is this panda category stuff, man.
[17:09.680 --> 17:10.900]  It's fucking science.
[17:12.120 --> 17:15.580]  I guess there are other animals that have a color first and they're the only one.
[17:17.280 --> 17:19.100]  Yeah, this one's the green frog.
[17:19.340 --> 17:20.180]  What about this other one?
[17:20.220 --> 17:20.900]  A big frog.
[17:24.920 --> 17:26.140]  A blue tit.
[17:26.420 --> 17:26.980]  Yeah.
[17:29.380 --> 17:30.940]  Wow, we suck.
[17:31.440 --> 17:31.800]  What?
[17:31.940 --> 17:33.140]  I've never seen somebody...
[17:33.140 --> 17:34.860]  This has been so bad.
[17:38.080 --> 17:38.960]  I feel confident.
[17:38.960 --> 17:39.780]  This has been terrible.
[17:40.260 --> 17:41.960]  I feel confident on this one.
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.260]  Do you?
[17:43.520 --> 17:43.820]  Yeah.
[17:44.140 --> 17:45.520]  It has cat eyes.
[17:50.400 --> 17:53.580]  If this is a giant panda, I'm going to turn my Xbox off.
[17:53.740 --> 17:53.980]  Yeah.
[17:53.980 --> 17:55.860]  It has to be giant panda.
[17:56.500 --> 17:57.840]  Oh, is that what it has to be?
[17:57.860 --> 17:58.960]  It has to be.
[17:59.580 --> 17:59.720]  Oh.
[18:01.500 --> 18:04.100]  That was a very tricky category.
[18:04.560 --> 18:06.360]  I'm being an evil little guy about it.
[18:06.360 --> 18:06.840]  I don't like it.
[18:08.140 --> 18:09.760]  I'm going to catch my arse all up.
[18:09.900 --> 18:11.180]  Oh, no.
[18:11.960 --> 18:12.420]  What is...
[18:12.420 --> 18:13.040]  Oh, I know it.
[18:13.280 --> 18:13.840]  I know it.
[18:14.160 --> 18:14.600]  Okay.
[18:15.000 --> 18:15.240]  Cool.
[18:16.900 --> 18:17.820]  Was that a good clue?
[18:18.220 --> 18:18.520]  Yeah.
[18:18.680 --> 18:21.180]  That might have tipped a hand a little bit.
[18:27.740 --> 18:30.900]  I'm going to type a one to make the chat lose.
[18:31.340 --> 18:31.680]  That's good.
[18:31.740 --> 18:32.200]  That's good.
[18:32.280 --> 18:33.700]  Get him in there.
[18:37.780 --> 18:38.300]  Okay.
[18:41.860 --> 18:42.880]  I know it.
[18:42.940 --> 18:43.700]  I know it.
[18:43.840 --> 18:45.840]  It doesn't mean shit when I do it.
[18:46.280 --> 18:46.880]  That's right.
[18:50.960 --> 18:53.400]  I definitely don't know it.
[18:54.280 --> 18:55.800]  Sounds like a...
[18:56.840 --> 18:59.820]  Oh, it took a stab in the dark.
[19:00.380 --> 19:01.100]  What a split.
[19:01.520 --> 19:02.500]  Dude, this...
[19:02.500 --> 19:03.600]  The chat is...
[19:03.600 --> 19:04.220]  Look at that.
[19:04.560 --> 19:05.180]  6634.
[19:06.740 --> 19:07.260]  Yeah.
[19:08.500 --> 19:09.120]  Shit.
[19:09.440 --> 19:11.200]  And you're out until the next category.
[19:11.600 --> 19:13.100]  I don't know my country at all.
[19:13.960 --> 19:15.200]  Oh, God.
[19:16.700 --> 19:17.940]  I mean...
[19:18.610 --> 19:18.920]  Okay.
[19:21.060 --> 19:21.440]  Okay.
[19:22.180 --> 19:23.740]  That seems a little...
[19:23.740 --> 19:24.160]  Had to be, right?
[19:24.380 --> 19:24.600]  Yeah.
[19:25.180 --> 19:26.800]  Apparently, this...
[19:29.660 --> 19:30.940]  Oh, God.
[19:36.640 --> 19:37.600]  Giant river.
[19:37.920 --> 19:39.440]  I'm panicking right now.
[19:39.580 --> 19:40.180]  Oh, boy.
[19:42.180 --> 19:43.440]  Oh, it...
[19:43.440 --> 19:43.840]  I mean...
[19:46.160 --> 19:47.140]  Has to be.
[19:48.140 --> 19:48.420]  Oh.
[19:49.480 --> 19:50.120]  Fuck.
[19:50.120 --> 19:50.760]  Fuck.
[19:52.440 --> 19:54.500]  I'm being an evil little guy about winning.
[19:56.420 --> 19:57.740]  God damn it.
[19:59.420 --> 20:00.020]  Woo.
[20:00.200 --> 20:04.400]  So, everyone's getting, like, blocked from typing because of spam protection.
[20:05.820 --> 20:07.300]  So, no one can play.
[20:07.860 --> 20:08.680]  Oh, that's funny.
[20:11.300 --> 20:12.440]  Oh, my God.
[20:12.540 --> 20:13.620]  You guys are about to make history.
[20:17.880 --> 20:18.480]  Beats?
[20:19.240 --> 20:19.840]  Beats?
[20:19.840 --> 20:20.640]  Me.
[20:21.460 --> 20:23.980]  Like a pyramid in the sun.
[20:26.940 --> 20:27.660]  What?
[20:28.020 --> 20:29.780]  Is that what you think the lyric is?
[20:29.940 --> 20:31.420]  Let me go pyramid.
[20:35.760 --> 20:36.460]  Hey.
[20:40.120 --> 20:40.840]  Wow.
[20:44.320 --> 20:45.400]  I mean...
[20:45.760 --> 20:46.460]  I couldn't...
[20:46.460 --> 20:47.300]  Any pyramid?
[20:47.780 --> 20:48.660]  Like, God damn.
[20:50.820 --> 20:52.320]  I see you, Warrior Wero.
[20:52.660 --> 20:53.980]  I see you getting the answer wrong.
[20:56.660 --> 21:03.040]  I'm trying to decide if loose knowledge of the road to Alvarado is gonna help me here.
[21:07.600 --> 21:08.080]  Woo.
[21:15.200 --> 21:15.680]  Oh.
[21:17.060 --> 21:17.540]  Alright.
[21:19.540 --> 21:21.620]  I see you, Red Robbie, getting the answer wrong.
[21:25.340 --> 21:27.100]  Whoever's not playing should just cool out.
[21:27.560 --> 21:29.000]  People are all wrong in the chat.
[21:29.440 --> 21:30.240]  It's too mean.
[21:31.460 --> 21:32.500]  Two people.
[21:32.900 --> 21:34.240]  Get on the same page.
[21:34.740 --> 21:35.460]  Fresh wing.
[21:36.220 --> 21:37.260]  You're wrong also.
[21:37.340 --> 21:37.940]  Way to go.
[21:38.620 --> 21:40.360]  Now everyone's deliberately going wrong.
[21:43.320 --> 21:45.540]  This is why we had to stop making presented with comment.
[21:49.620 --> 21:51.400]  Way to go, Squishfishium.
[21:51.600 --> 21:52.640]  Getting it wrong.
[21:58.840 --> 21:59.760]  Back on rivers.
[22:02.020 --> 22:03.620]  It's Path, getting it wrong.
[22:03.720 --> 22:04.280]  Way to go.
[22:08.680 --> 22:11.160]  Galaxy Ray, getting it wrong on purpose so I read your name.
[22:11.240 --> 22:11.660]  Hell yeah.
[22:14.540 --> 22:15.720]  So fucking transparent.
[22:28.070 --> 22:28.790]  Come on, Gavin.
[22:31.790 --> 22:32.670]  You know this.
[22:33.250 --> 22:35.610]  I saw someone with the name wrong answer picking the wrong answer.
[22:42.360 --> 22:43.840]  I think we all got this.
[22:43.840 --> 22:45.680]  I think we all were on the board on this one, right?
[22:45.880 --> 22:46.540]  Do we get anything?
[22:47.160 --> 22:47.900]  We all get a wedge.
[22:48.420 --> 22:48.660]  Stepped.
[22:48.880 --> 22:49.460]  Do we really?
[22:49.760 --> 22:49.940]  Yep.
[22:50.600 --> 22:51.620]  Absolutely both stepped.
[22:52.260 --> 22:53.980]  I'm an evil little guy about getting a wedge.
[22:56.260 --> 22:56.620]  Okay.
[22:57.400 --> 22:58.480]  Oh, piss off.
[23:06.560 --> 23:07.280]  I guess.
[23:07.280 --> 23:08.800]  I've got to unlock it.
[23:10.280 --> 23:14.600]  Oh, dude.
[23:14.860 --> 23:15.800]  He's doing opera.
[23:17.040 --> 23:19.040]  Andrew Tchaikovsky is Russian.
[23:22.820 --> 23:24.340]  All right.
[23:27.260 --> 23:29.760]  Who's the best of Tchaikovsky?
[23:29.980 --> 23:30.100]  What?
[23:32.360 --> 23:33.540]  You're right, man.
[23:37.580 --> 23:38.920]  You want to try one more time?
[23:39.000 --> 23:39.360]  Are you good?
[23:39.720 --> 23:40.800]  No, it's not worth it.
[23:40.800 --> 23:41.420]  Okay, just checking.
[23:46.020 --> 23:47.680]  Don't film it too much today.
[23:53.840 --> 23:54.720]  All right.
[23:55.160 --> 23:55.600]  Okay.
[24:02.420 --> 24:03.160]  Hey, what's up?
[24:03.280 --> 24:04.160]  She is real.
[24:07.280 --> 24:07.580]  What?
[24:17.160 --> 24:18.080]  Somebody said three.
[24:18.300 --> 24:19.000]  Isn't this what...
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.740]  Good job, Flash Chemist.
[24:22.140 --> 24:24.500]  Isn't this what fucked up Natalie Portman in Black Swan?
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.120]  Is that what a Flash Chemist is?
[24:27.320 --> 24:27.960]  I don't know.
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.440]  I saw the name Stinky Cheese Dog.
[24:29.720 --> 24:29.940]  I don't know.
[24:35.090 --> 24:36.310]  Eugene on a gin.
[24:38.290 --> 24:39.750]  I don't know.
[24:43.630 --> 24:45.230]  Bleep, bloop, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.
[24:45.230 --> 24:45.530]  Eugene won gin.
[24:48.670 --> 24:49.830]  Eugene won gin.
[24:49.970 --> 24:50.970]  Eugene won gin, red fish, blue fish.
[24:52.750 --> 24:53.950]  Oh, we're doing a sequel?
[24:54.190 --> 24:54.770]  Big Eugene.
[24:57.250 --> 24:58.150]  Giant Eugene.
[24:59.430 --> 25:00.170]  Oh, man.
[25:03.290 --> 25:04.870]  These are truly random.
[25:06.090 --> 25:07.470]  Hey, you guys know this one.
[25:08.290 --> 25:09.550]  These are truly random.
[25:09.910 --> 25:10.830]  Gavin's dead.
[25:12.010 --> 25:14.170]  Yeah, Gavin's going to get kicked out.
[25:14.890 --> 25:16.350]  Kicked out for being the dumbest idiot.
[25:16.930 --> 25:17.650]  Goddamn right.
[25:21.330 --> 25:22.170]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[25:22.370 --> 25:23.410]  Gavin can't stop.
[25:23.690 --> 25:25.970]  He can't be kicked out because he's the backup recording.
[25:26.210 --> 25:27.130]  And then Andrew's hosting.
[25:27.150 --> 25:28.150]  Oh, shit, that's right.
[25:28.470 --> 25:29.850]  For the game, so he has to do it.
[25:29.890 --> 25:31.750]  So I'll probably just have to sit out the next round too.
[25:32.350 --> 25:36.550]  No, I can just describe the background recording.
[25:36.810 --> 25:38.150]  Okay, Vex, shut up.
[25:40.350 --> 25:42.550]  I mean, it's on the VOD, isn't it?
[25:42.790 --> 25:44.090]  As long as we have the VOD.
[25:44.930 --> 25:46.950]  We would lose the VOD and lose Eric.
[25:47.530 --> 25:51.230]  Well, the VOD would be the issue because what it's streaming out is the thing that I have.
[25:53.010 --> 25:55.950]  What's in Twitch is recording it, though. It's saving it.
[25:56.270 --> 26:03.730]  Right, but if something screws up in my recording, then it'll probably also be screwed up on Twitch, vice versa.
[26:04.110 --> 26:05.310]  How on earth does that work?
[26:05.850 --> 26:07.590]  Unfortunately, you're going to have to keep playing, Gavin.
[26:08.050 --> 26:09.410]  What are you talking about?
[26:10.070 --> 26:11.290]  Nobody's happy about it.
[26:11.310 --> 26:12.550]  You're the backup. I don't know.
[26:12.550 --> 26:14.990]  Sorry, the game has ended. Connection was lost or turned in.
[26:15.070 --> 26:15.750]  What the heck?
[26:16.270 --> 26:17.650]  Dude, why'd you kick me out?
[26:17.810 --> 26:19.830]  You gotta send out invites.
[26:20.210 --> 26:21.690]  Let me know when the invite's out.
[26:22.550 --> 26:24.450]  Why don't you just host one?
[26:26.630 --> 26:27.430]  You wanna play?
[26:29.410 --> 26:30.930]  Oh, no, I'm happy to sit out.
[26:31.490 --> 26:32.630]  No, Geoff, you're playing, son.
[26:33.250 --> 26:34.010]  No, I'm okay.
[26:34.470 --> 26:35.470]  No, you should be playing.
[26:35.650 --> 26:37.630]  Why does everyone sound like Nick?
[26:39.210 --> 26:41.130]  Geoff, you gotta host then if you're gonna play.
[26:41.130 --> 26:43.030]  I don't know how to host. I can't do it.
[26:43.050 --> 26:45.070]  I crack under the pressure.
[26:46.010 --> 26:46.450]  Jalapenos!
[26:47.030 --> 26:48.870]  Do I play online?
[26:49.890 --> 26:50.970]  Play online Twitch?
[26:51.670 --> 26:53.410]  Yup, play on Twitch and then just put in
[26:53.410 --> 26:54.650]  the regulation pod.
[26:55.490 --> 26:56.310]  Oh, God.
[26:56.610 --> 26:58.250]  Connect to Twitch.
[26:58.730 --> 27:01.570]  Well, who's fucking stepping out? You're the backup!
[27:02.290 --> 27:03.610]  We went over this!
[27:03.910 --> 27:04.890]  You've already got a backup.
[27:05.110 --> 27:07.090]  Eric's got two copies of the goddamn thing.
[27:07.150 --> 27:08.750]  No, he doesn't know if he does or not.
[27:08.750 --> 27:11.210]  One is on Twitch and one's on his computer.
[27:12.170 --> 27:12.970]  Okay, well, if we
[27:13.610 --> 27:15.190]  lose this recording, you're gonna look
[27:15.190 --> 27:16.350]  like a real ass.
[27:16.930 --> 27:18.550]  We've got it on Twitch, though.
[27:19.910 --> 27:20.650]  What are you saying?
[27:21.530 --> 27:23.190]  Alright, fine, then I'll just sit
[27:23.190 --> 27:23.770]  in for Gavin.
[27:24.670 --> 27:26.610]  We'll fly, we'll throw cards from the wind.
[27:27.590 --> 27:29.170]  Hey, guys, what's up? It's Eric here
[27:29.170 --> 27:31.450]  and I love playing with you, the fans,
[27:31.870 --> 27:33.610]  online. Can't get enough of it.
[27:33.670 --> 27:35.350]  I'm the only one not trying to weasel
[27:35.350 --> 27:37.230]  out of this thing. Our obligation
[27:37.230 --> 27:39.410]  every Friday at 4pm central.
[27:39.770 --> 27:41.510]  We love streaming with you.
[27:41.570 --> 27:43.710]  We love doing this. Thank you guys so much for being here
[27:43.710 --> 27:45.670]  with us. I'm having a great time.
[27:45.790 --> 27:46.850]  Just me, personally.
[27:48.330 --> 27:48.730]  Burp.
[27:50.030 --> 27:51.430]  Here's an invite for Eric.
[27:52.190 --> 27:53.130]  Oh, yeah, let me know
[27:53.130 --> 27:54.110]  when the invite's out.
[27:54.250 --> 27:57.410]  Anyone in the
[27:57.410 --> 27:59.190]  anyone watching could also record it.
[27:59.290 --> 28:01.810]  Let's see if we get like 700 backup
[28:01.810 --> 28:02.370]  copies.
[28:03.950 --> 28:04.270]  Yes.
[28:07.750 --> 28:08.370]  I'm ready.
[28:09.030 --> 28:11.510]  Eric is ready. I'm ready. Geoff is ready.
[28:12.630 --> 28:13.790]  Geoff is an entertainment
[28:13.790 --> 28:15.110]  fan. Let's do this.
[28:15.590 --> 28:17.650]  AI player, what happened? I am an entertainment
[28:17.650 --> 28:19.570]  fan. What happened to the
[28:20.150 --> 28:21.330]  what happened to the fans?
[28:21.910 --> 28:22.830]  They're not on there.
[28:23.550 --> 28:25.150]  No, it says zero, but it'll be fine.
[28:26.110 --> 28:26.430]  You're right.
[28:27.430 --> 28:28.590]  That's what it was like last time.
[28:31.530 --> 28:33.350]  Alright, I think the answer is one.
[28:38.310 --> 28:38.870]  I'm
[28:38.870 --> 28:40.610]  see, I'm hearing reports it's two.
[28:40.990 --> 28:41.970]  So I don't know who to believe.
[28:42.550 --> 28:44.610]  I'm an evil little guy, so I say it's three.
[28:45.450 --> 28:46.570]  Round one.
[28:46.650 --> 28:47.430]  Round one.
[28:48.990 --> 28:50.790]  Good luck, everyone. Let's have a good
[28:50.790 --> 28:51.730]  clean game. Quick start.
[28:52.530 --> 28:54.350]  Okay. Alright.
[28:54.750 --> 28:56.490]  Biggest loser idiot gets booted.
[29:03.510 --> 29:04.070]  History.
[29:05.290 --> 29:06.570]  Both past and present.
[29:07.170 --> 29:08.850]  Let's make history. What?
[29:09.570 --> 29:10.250]  History.
[29:12.990 --> 29:15.110]  I don't, I'm just, okay.
[29:15.550 --> 29:15.930]  Sure.
[29:20.990 --> 29:23.450]  I don't think I've ever thought about
[29:23.450 --> 29:25.370]  this question in my life.
[29:27.090 --> 29:29.290]  I don't see a Reginald Stouffer,
[29:34.190 --> 29:34.870]  so...
[29:34.870 --> 29:37.150]  Hey! I mean, Birdseye
[29:37.150 --> 29:38.890]  Birdseye is the only name that I know in...
[29:38.890 --> 29:40.490]  It isn't really Captain Birdseye?
[29:40.850 --> 29:42.070]  Yeah, it's...
[29:42.070 --> 29:44.110]  Birdseye is like frozen peas, right?
[29:44.330 --> 29:45.930]  Like fish fingers and shit.
[29:46.310 --> 29:51.310]  It just sounds like a Mega64 thing.
[29:51.650 --> 29:52.210]  Sports and leisure.
[29:55.750 --> 29:56.050]  Ooh!
[29:57.470 --> 29:58.610]  Oh my goodness.
[30:01.050 --> 30:02.850]  I think I picked the wrong one.
[30:04.030 --> 30:04.510]  Hey!
[30:09.270 --> 30:10.670]  You're gonna make some weird sounds.
[30:14.850 --> 30:15.850]  Gasping for air.
[30:16.810 --> 30:18.470]  How does it determine who gets their name
[30:18.470 --> 30:19.370]  on the granny?
[30:20.830 --> 30:21.670]  I don't know.
[30:22.290 --> 30:24.130]  Maybe who's winning, like who's like leading
[30:24.130 --> 30:25.870]  for that team? Oh!
[30:26.010 --> 30:28.550]  There we go, cool. Andrew, what happened?
[30:29.090 --> 30:30.150]  It felt too obvious.
[30:30.650 --> 30:32.410]  That's what I thought too after I picked it.
[30:32.530 --> 30:34.170]  I thought Tour de la Provence
[30:34.170 --> 30:35.070]  was going to be it.
[30:35.750 --> 30:38.310]  Was it the Tour de France where some woman was like
[30:38.310 --> 30:39.830]  leading into the...
[30:39.830 --> 30:40.930]  Oh, got like annihilated?
[30:41.710 --> 30:43.510]  And took out like a hundred riders?
[30:44.050 --> 30:46.390]  Oh my god, 25 gifted subs
[30:46.390 --> 30:47.910]  from so much!
[30:47.910 --> 30:49.330]  Thank you so much!
[30:49.710 --> 30:50.530]  How do you say it?
[30:52.410 --> 30:53.530]  Oh my god.
[30:54.730 --> 30:56.430]  Do you guys remember the answer?
[30:56.550 --> 30:57.190]  I think I do.
[30:57.310 --> 30:59.910]  I watched the song
[30:59.910 --> 31:02.770]  where Bing Crosby's singing at him
[31:02.770 --> 31:05.230]  like yesterday, but I don't remember
[31:05.230 --> 31:06.010]  the answer to this.
[31:08.330 --> 31:09.470]  I'm trying to think
[31:09.470 --> 31:11.230]  who's the most wuss of all
[31:11.230 --> 31:12.990]  these professions, so I picked Schoolmaster.
[31:13.570 --> 31:15.170]  Yeah! I just remember him with a bunch
[31:15.170 --> 31:16.710]  of books. Yeah.
[31:17.510 --> 31:18.970]  Except who's the biggest fucking
[31:18.970 --> 31:20.790]  pussy and it's Schoolmaster?
[31:24.210 --> 31:25.330]  It's Schoolmaster!
[31:26.790 --> 31:27.290]  That's right,
[31:27.430 --> 31:28.670]  take that teachers.
[31:29.570 --> 31:29.990]  Okay.
[31:34.070 --> 31:35.330]  I was not a member
[31:35.330 --> 31:37.170]  of the Monty Python comedy troupe.
[31:42.230 --> 31:43.350]  I win
[31:43.350 --> 31:44.810]  so badly.
[31:45.490 --> 31:47.190]  I so badly
[31:47.190 --> 31:47.910]  want this.
[31:49.750 --> 31:50.310]  Honestly...
[31:51.730 --> 31:53.250]  Honestly, I'm gonna pick one
[31:53.250 --> 31:55.270]  to kick out and put another one in
[31:55.270 --> 31:57.250]  and that's gonna be a real dare.
[31:57.570 --> 31:59.290]  The parrot sketch is gonna be
[31:59.290 --> 32:00.130]  so awesome.
[32:03.470 --> 32:05.070]  I wonder what Larry King's
[32:05.070 --> 32:06.230]  funny walk would've been.
[32:10.870 --> 32:11.870]  Oh, man.
[32:13.890 --> 32:15.090]  Larry King's
[32:15.090 --> 32:15.710]  funny walk.
[32:17.970 --> 32:19.130]  Oh, we are the knights of safety.
[32:20.090 --> 32:20.610]  See?
[32:21.210 --> 32:21.810]  Bizan...
[32:23.610 --> 32:24.210]  Rinalin.
[32:25.530 --> 32:26.590]  Kill him, that.
[32:26.730 --> 32:27.970]  Was the...
[32:27.970 --> 32:29.470]  Was the pussy.
[32:30.330 --> 32:30.910]  Geography.
[32:32.170 --> 32:33.730]  Let's say CBY.
[32:34.410 --> 32:35.770]  Largest? Oh, Geoff!
[32:38.070 --> 32:40.190]  I think I know the answer to that.
[32:40.510 --> 32:41.650]  I don't. I don't.
[32:41.750 --> 32:43.710]  I don't like any of these fucking places, I'll tell you that.
[32:44.250 --> 32:45.990]  Yeah, they're all in Alabama.
[32:48.010 --> 32:50.230]  Bad Rabbits, good pick.
[32:54.250 --> 32:55.870]  Lizzy Joyce, good pick.
[32:55.870 --> 32:58.130]  Snorting Turtle, one, good pick.
[33:01.010 --> 33:01.690]  Yeah!
[33:02.110 --> 33:02.610]  Nice.
[33:06.410 --> 33:08.210]  Figure it's Birmingham
[33:08.210 --> 33:09.850]  or Montgomery, but
[33:09.850 --> 33:10.990]  beats me.
[33:12.710 --> 33:14.630]  I'm a dead last, I only missed one.
[33:14.810 --> 33:15.770]  The two big towns.
[33:16.350 --> 33:16.710]  Uh-huh.
[33:17.930 --> 33:20.270]  Huntsville and Mobile down below a little bit.
[33:20.830 --> 33:21.070]  Yup.
[33:21.470 --> 33:21.970]  Oh!
[33:26.890 --> 33:28.310]  Sandbell09 is leading with NordicWallaby.
[33:29.170 --> 33:29.830]  Way to go.
[33:32.570 --> 33:34.030]  Way to go, NordicWallaby.
[33:36.310 --> 33:38.110]  It's a good Friday. What? It's not?
[33:39.190 --> 33:39.770]  What's that?
[33:39.910 --> 33:41.870]  It's a good Friday. I'm enjoying it.
[33:41.870 --> 33:43.090]  Damn, it's gloomy out.
[33:43.870 --> 33:45.610]  I like it. We've had so much sunshine.
[33:47.090 --> 33:47.930]  I'll take a little gloom.
[33:48.370 --> 33:49.990]  It makes my wife crazy.
[33:50.250 --> 33:51.070]  She needs the sun.
[33:52.450 --> 33:53.750]  She's in the right place for it.
[33:53.750 --> 33:56.270]  I only answered four questions and then stopped.
[33:57.710 --> 33:58.110]  What?
[33:58.530 --> 34:00.890]  I think I was skewing the stats or something.
[34:06.320 --> 34:07.180]  Yeah, I don't care.
[34:08.080 --> 34:08.440]  Skip!
[34:12.510 --> 34:13.170]  Oh, you're a little devil?
[34:13.270 --> 34:15.230]  Evil guy, evil guy, evil guy, evil little guy.
[34:15.490 --> 34:17.830]  Andrew, pick a category. Yeah, sure am. Entertainment.
[34:18.050 --> 34:19.070]  What do you think? Thank you.
[34:19.710 --> 34:21.870]  Always. It's entertainment, baby.
[34:22.030 --> 34:22.790]  I like to be entertained.
[34:24.090 --> 34:25.470]  And you get first pick.
[34:25.470 --> 34:26.690]  Oh, wow!
[34:27.150 --> 34:27.510]  I have no idea.
[34:29.850 --> 34:32.490]  I mean, self-titled album, I'd assume.
[34:41.540 --> 34:42.340]  Chat's picking.
[34:45.970 --> 34:48.650]  God, I wish I was a System of a Down fan.
[34:49.350 --> 34:51.370]  I so am not.
[34:52.350 --> 34:53.990]  That is like the fucking...
[34:53.990 --> 34:57.210]  If you go into a tattoo parlor you're not familiar with,
[34:57.210 --> 34:59.790]  there's like a 37% chance
[34:59.790 --> 35:01.490]  System of a Down's playing when you walk in.
[35:01.710 --> 35:03.810]  Yeah. Dude, I have no idea.
[35:04.210 --> 35:04.470]  Like,
[35:05.410 --> 35:07.250]  so not a band
[35:07.250 --> 35:09.790]  that I listen to at all.
[35:09.930 --> 35:10.190]  Yeah.
[35:11.070 --> 35:13.210]  Well, Daddy gets to pick first on the next one.
[35:14.650 --> 35:15.750]  I think it might just be
[35:15.750 --> 35:16.770]  random from this point.
[35:18.290 --> 35:19.930]  No, I think it's lowest score goes first.
[35:22.810 --> 35:24.410]  Oh my god!
[35:26.310 --> 35:26.670]  Ooh,
[35:26.790 --> 35:28.810]  boy, is it Hawaii?
[35:30.870 --> 35:31.950]  I believe it is.
[35:36.310 --> 35:36.670]  It's...
[35:37.090 --> 35:37.950]  Geoff, what do you think?
[35:38.690 --> 35:39.990]  I mean, I have to go.
[35:40.590 --> 35:42.450]  Yeah, I know. If that's getting locked in, what do you...
[35:42.450 --> 35:45.050]  I mean, Andrew has to go next and he doesn't know anything about this place.
[35:46.590 --> 35:48.670]  I'm not going to say what I think because I...
[35:48.670 --> 35:50.090]  Ooh, smart.
[35:54.410 --> 35:54.850]  Uh...
[35:55.550 --> 35:57.050]  I think that is a great pick.
[35:57.150 --> 35:58.510]  I think that was a great pick too, buddy.
[36:01.150 --> 36:01.590]  Hey!
[36:02.470 --> 36:02.970]  Best of what I had.
[36:04.170 --> 36:06.270]  Oklahoma was later than Washington?
[36:06.550 --> 36:07.230]  I had no idea.
[36:07.610 --> 36:08.530]  That's insane.
[36:08.690 --> 36:11.310]  It also makes total sense with that awful place.
[36:11.610 --> 36:12.250]  But it is a...
[36:14.530 --> 36:16.230]  As much as I'm not a fan of Arizona,
[36:16.410 --> 36:17.250]  Flagstaff's really cool.
[36:19.030 --> 36:20.090]  Gotta check it out.
[36:22.090 --> 36:22.570]  Ooh!
[36:26.440 --> 36:27.580]  Time to pick, Geoff.
[36:27.960 --> 36:29.120]  Sponge Daddy was first?
[36:32.560 --> 36:33.040]  Um...
[36:33.760 --> 36:34.940]  I don't know what this is.
[36:35.200 --> 36:35.920]  Sounds old.
[36:38.980 --> 36:39.940]  Like, uh...
[36:40.660 --> 36:41.140]  K?
[36:43.320 --> 36:44.460]  Gavin, what do you think it is?
[36:46.300 --> 36:47.160]  Out of the five.
[36:48.740 --> 36:49.180]  Two.
[36:50.060 --> 36:50.500]  What?
[36:51.640 --> 36:52.520]  Are you okay?
[36:53.980 --> 36:55.700]  Do we wake you from your slumber?
[36:56.140 --> 36:57.780]  Yeah, are you alright, man?
[36:58.940 --> 37:00.260]  Wait, what did I do wrong?
[37:00.280 --> 37:02.080]  It sounded like he was aging
[37:02.080 --> 37:03.240]  while he wasn't talking.
[37:04.520 --> 37:04.960]  Shit!
[37:08.220 --> 37:09.560]  Cynobacteria! Good pick.
[37:09.700 --> 37:11.400]  Oh, that's a great... cyno.
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.920]  Oh, I'm sorry. Make fun of me because I can't read.
[37:18.700 --> 37:20.200]  No, I wasn't looking
[37:20.200 --> 37:21.660]  because I was sending an invite to Eric.
[37:22.300 --> 37:23.920]  Let's not make fun of the system
[37:23.920 --> 37:25.140]  that failed Eric.
[37:25.400 --> 37:26.480]  Let's make fun of Eric.
[37:28.260 --> 37:28.720]  What?
[37:29.760 --> 37:30.460]  Oh, gross. Who cares?
[37:31.140 --> 37:31.960]  Oh my god.
[37:33.680 --> 37:35.700]  This is the worst of all the names.
[37:36.140 --> 37:37.200]  So, I'm gonna go with this one.
[37:38.060 --> 37:39.240]  Written in my own heart's blood
[37:39.240 --> 37:40.940]  sounds like a Hawthorne Heights song title.
[37:43.660 --> 37:46.600]  I can't make it on my own!
[37:48.980 --> 37:49.420]  Uh...
[37:53.900 --> 37:56.160]  I've never read a single one of these Outlander books.
[37:57.160 --> 37:58.780]  Oh, I thought it was Highlander.
[37:59.120 --> 38:01.400]  No, it's kind of similar though.
[38:01.500 --> 38:03.440]  It's about, like, time-traveling
[38:03.440 --> 38:04.340]  Scottish people.
[38:05.540 --> 38:06.600]  I should have just
[38:07.240 --> 38:08.800]  asked Meg. I feel like Meg would have known.
[38:09.200 --> 38:10.140]  Uh, yeah, maybe.
[38:11.980 --> 38:13.420]  It's kind of...
[38:13.420 --> 38:15.380]  romance-y, so your wife might know.
[38:15.420 --> 38:15.820]  Yay!
[38:17.100 --> 38:17.580]  Woo!
[38:19.660 --> 38:21.080]  Let's pick the one that sounds like
[38:21.080 --> 38:22.520]  it's a soundtrack from The Crow.
[38:24.960 --> 38:25.440]  Awesome.
[38:25.700 --> 38:27.020]  Here's the final question.
[38:27.620 --> 38:28.520]  Final question?
[38:28.540 --> 38:30.600]  All four of those could have been emo bands.
[38:31.880 --> 38:32.360]  Oh, wow.
[38:32.600 --> 38:34.580]  The chat has to pick a category.
[38:34.940 --> 38:36.140]  Oh my god.
[38:36.600 --> 38:37.860]  I call this a chat-agory.
[38:39.540 --> 38:41.300]  Wait, so they have to do this every time?
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.820]  Only if they...
[38:43.820 --> 38:46.680]  Yours is last, so...
[38:46.680 --> 38:47.640]  You can pick, Gavin.
[38:48.740 --> 38:49.340]  I picked.
[38:49.820 --> 38:50.620]  What'd you pick?
[38:51.140 --> 38:51.680]  Number three.
[38:52.440 --> 38:54.320]  You bastard man.
[38:56.580 --> 38:57.780]  Told you he's a rabbit.
[38:58.680 --> 38:58.900]  Yep.
[38:59.660 --> 39:02.160]  He pulled a weasel move on Gears of War today.
[39:02.300 --> 39:02.720]  That was awesome.
[39:05.500 --> 39:05.760]  Oh.
[39:07.700 --> 39:08.260]  Uh...
[39:08.260 --> 39:09.600]  Well, the chat goes first.
[39:10.680 --> 39:11.240]  Yeah.
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.600]  But this is so...
[39:19.600 --> 39:21.080]  Everyone is picking everything.
[39:22.680 --> 39:24.040]  Andrew you're next.
[39:31.030 --> 39:31.750]  Uh...
[39:31.750 --> 39:33.190]  Damn it.
[39:35.070 --> 39:35.790]  AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[39:39.270 --> 39:40.790]  I have no idea.
[39:41.150 --> 39:43.110]  Grease's looks like it's smashed to pieces.
[39:43.710 --> 39:44.430]  Alright.
[39:45.190 --> 39:45.590]  Alright.
[39:46.150 --> 39:47.790]  Vietnam was my pick.
[39:48.010 --> 39:49.370]  Vietnam was my pick, too.
[39:50.550 --> 39:52.230]  Serbia has 29?
[39:53.490 --> 39:54.930]  I just figured it's probably pretty big.
[39:55.490 --> 39:55.930]  Yeah.
[39:56.810 --> 39:58.130]  Canada was an insane pick.
[39:58.390 --> 39:59.110]  Yeah, I agree.
[39:59.310 --> 40:00.550]  I feel like people actually know those.
[40:00.810 --> 40:03.870]  But that's just because people know the word provinces with Canada.
[40:03.950 --> 40:04.070]  Yeah.
[40:04.090 --> 40:04.890]  That's why they picked it.
[40:05.210 --> 40:05.430]  Oh.
[40:06.310 --> 40:06.510]  Yeah.
[40:07.710 --> 40:10.990]  We have a real chance to kick the audience out in this game.
[40:10.990 --> 40:12.570]  Yeah, the audience might be out of this one, guys.
[40:13.990 --> 40:16.530]  That might be the funniest way this goes.
[40:16.530 --> 40:20.870]  Like the stream ends because the audience gets kicked out and it becomes a private recording.
[40:20.890 --> 40:22.830]  Yeah, we just play and you have to watch the VOD.
[40:24.710 --> 40:26.670]  Recovery won in first place.
[40:26.810 --> 40:27.430]  Way to go.
[40:27.850 --> 40:28.670]  Good work.
[40:29.390 --> 40:30.830]  Why does it keep putting me on the board?
[40:37.680 --> 40:40.080]  I've answered six for the last few questions.
[40:43.900 --> 40:44.940]  Ooh, okay.
[40:45.140 --> 40:45.620]  Alright.
[40:46.400 --> 40:46.860]  Here we go.
[40:49.240 --> 40:50.940]  It could cost you the wedge, Gavin.
[40:53.380 --> 40:55.000]  Neutron JJ needs an apostrophe.
[40:57.560 --> 40:58.660]  Alright, here we go, boys.
[41:02.270 --> 41:02.810]  Yes!
[41:03.070 --> 41:03.870]  Hell yeah.
[41:04.010 --> 41:06.270]  This is... Geoff might come away clean.
[41:07.610 --> 41:08.670]  Oh, come on.
[41:09.330 --> 41:10.690]  Why are we even doing this?
[41:11.410 --> 41:13.410]  Everyone's getting a wedge this round.
[41:19.550 --> 41:22.810]  If the chat gets one wrong, I'm turning off my Xbox.
[41:35.820 --> 41:36.380]  Lucky.
[41:36.920 --> 41:39.180]  Dedicated that correct answer to Chris Pratt.
[41:41.400 --> 41:43.200]  Send a message to Eric.
[41:44.580 --> 41:45.520]  On what?
[41:46.340 --> 41:47.040]  Oh, Xbox.
[41:47.460 --> 41:49.140]  Do I need to check it?
[41:49.140 --> 41:52.900]  He invited me to a party?
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.120]  What is this?
[41:55.140 --> 41:57.080]  Gavin invited me to play Grand Theft Auto?
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.080]  That is so cruel.
[42:04.720 --> 42:05.120]  No!
[42:11.780 --> 42:15.320]  To be fair, we don't know their entire friend groups.
[42:16.220 --> 42:16.480]  Yeah.
[42:20.960 --> 42:21.600]  Miles.
[42:28.830 --> 42:29.470]  Kilometers.
[42:32.130 --> 42:33.410]  Miles Kilometers.
[42:34.010 --> 42:34.910]  Wasn't his name Miles?
[42:36.490 --> 42:38.510]  Yes, it's Miles Prower.
[42:38.950 --> 42:39.350]  Oh, okay.
[42:42.330 --> 42:42.970]  What?
[42:45.430 --> 42:47.530]  His name is Dr. Ivo?
[42:48.330 --> 42:51.270]  Yeah, Dr. Ivo. Everyone knows him as Dr. Ivo.
[42:51.810 --> 42:53.470]  Dr. Ivo?
[42:59.140 --> 43:00.160]  Lost my helicopter.
[43:02.600 --> 43:03.560]  Boo! Boo!
[43:04.380 --> 43:05.680]  I want to do pumpkins.
[43:06.600 --> 43:08.900]  You guys were busy playing a different video game all day.
[43:08.960 --> 43:10.720]  It could be playing Grand Theft Auto right now.
[43:14.970 --> 43:16.310]  Everyone gets a wedge.
[43:16.710 --> 43:18.410]  God, this category sucked.
[43:20.350 --> 43:24.510]  We might be the only people in the history of video games to play,
[43:24.650 --> 43:27.150]  to do all the dumb side missions on Inconceivable.
[43:27.150 --> 43:28.810]  On Gears 5.
[43:29.450 --> 43:30.890]  We're getting collectibles.
[43:31.470 --> 43:33.770]  We're just getting fucking relic weapons.
[43:35.630 --> 43:38.010]  Took us an hour and a half to get one relic weapon today.
[43:38.950 --> 43:39.690]  Damn.
[43:41.510 --> 43:42.770]  Four more to go.
[43:43.830 --> 43:45.210]  On this chapter.
[43:48.290 --> 43:50.390]  Alright, we all got wedges.
[43:50.870 --> 43:53.070]  Who's at the top? Dr. Viggles!
[43:54.150 --> 43:56.930]  Culture, events, both past and present.
[43:56.990 --> 43:57.510]  Alright, here we go.
[43:58.510 --> 43:59.250]  Oh my god.
[44:08.230 --> 44:11.190]  I'm gonna just... I'm gonna pick.
[44:12.250 --> 44:13.510]  I'm just gonna pick.
[44:13.950 --> 44:15.470]  I picked for a reason.
[44:17.050 --> 44:18.950]  What is it? What's your reason?
[44:19.370 --> 44:20.350]  Have you heard of him?
[44:20.350 --> 44:24.090]  And I figured that was because he's probably way too old.
[44:24.430 --> 44:24.790]  Yeah.
[44:24.910 --> 44:27.350]  Like, he was even older than the Romans, because the Greeks are older,
[44:27.430 --> 44:28.450]  and that's probably why I hadn't heard of him.
[44:28.930 --> 44:30.170]  He had a pretty Greek name, though.
[44:31.670 --> 44:32.390]  Yeah. Epicurious?
[44:38.330 --> 44:40.530]  That's the name of Epic Games before they changed it.
[44:42.730 --> 44:44.470]  I get recipes from this guy.
[44:55.760 --> 44:56.120]  Alright.
[44:58.460 --> 44:58.900]  Alright.
[45:03.940 --> 45:05.840]  That sounds like...
[45:06.380 --> 45:10.060]  I don't want to say anything.
[45:10.760 --> 45:11.460]  Yeah, I...
[45:13.860 --> 45:16.320]  Dude, these are... go back to Sonic the Hedgehog.
[45:17.660 --> 45:18.760]  I feel like this is a game that...
[45:18.760 --> 45:21.040]  Trying to rescue a princess, trying to rescue a princess.
[45:21.740 --> 45:23.320]  Russell Crowe would have killed in Gladiator.
[45:25.900 --> 45:27.000]  I got it wrong.
[45:29.140 --> 45:30.240]  Daddy's locked out.
[45:36.140 --> 45:38.280]  I immediately locked in, but then I was like,
[45:38.600 --> 45:39.120]  Is he this?
[45:39.800 --> 45:41.420]  I think he's this.
[46:00.940 --> 46:02.140]  I thought we were done.
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.460]  No, you got the last one.
[46:04.800 --> 46:07.420]  That was the longest silence we've ever had at Regulation.
[46:07.660 --> 46:09.360]  I thought that we were done.
[46:09.700 --> 46:10.780]  I thought we made it.
[46:12.140 --> 46:13.020]  Made it!
[46:13.520 --> 46:15.520]  Looks like we made it.
[46:15.520 --> 46:18.400]  This whole question is...
[46:18.400 --> 46:20.040]  Look at the last two letters of the name.
[46:28.140 --> 46:28.680]  Alright.
[46:34.970 --> 46:35.930]  Here we go.
[46:37.070 --> 46:37.710]  Could be it.
[46:37.710 --> 46:39.470]  Biology, chemistry, space.
[46:39.590 --> 46:40.450]  It's all here.
[46:43.670 --> 46:48.430]  It's noted for its venomous fin spines.
[46:48.530 --> 46:50.010]  Pufferfish or lionfish?
[46:51.650 --> 46:52.930]  I'm feeling...
[46:52.930 --> 46:54.790]  Not what the...
[46:55.630 --> 46:56.870]  Chat was feeling.
[46:57.010 --> 46:58.750]  I felt really good about it.
[46:59.150 --> 46:59.870]  Yeah, me too.
[47:00.390 --> 47:02.410]  Yeah, I'm a little confused by the chat right now.
[47:02.790 --> 47:03.430]  Chat?
[47:04.610 --> 47:05.250]  Chat?
[47:05.250 --> 47:05.530]  Chat?
[47:06.710 --> 47:08.250]  Are we wrong?
[47:09.430 --> 47:09.950]  No!
[47:11.590 --> 47:12.690]  Had no idea.
[47:14.190 --> 47:15.510]  Well, that's over fast.
[47:16.070 --> 47:16.690]  Chat wins!
[47:17.930 --> 47:19.470]  From last to winning.
[47:20.070 --> 47:20.490]  Wow.
[47:20.770 --> 47:22.690]  Well, I guess we'll hang out for ten minutes.
[47:23.990 --> 47:25.690]  We didn't get to see the fugu question.
[47:30.370 --> 47:31.870]  Congratulations, chat.
[47:31.870 --> 47:33.710]  That's how I feel about it. I feel evil about it.
[47:33.710 --> 47:38.870]  Your accumulated knowledge is slightly greater than our normal idiot knowledge.
[47:39.590 --> 47:40.230]  Good job.
[47:40.290 --> 47:42.950]  You guys sitting there googling the answer and then inputting it.
[47:43.410 --> 47:44.430]  Bested us once again.
[47:46.850 --> 47:47.630]  Way to go.
[47:48.750 --> 47:49.130]  Should we do one more?
[47:51.310 --> 47:53.210]  It'll take us well past.
[47:53.590 --> 47:54.570]  But it's up to you guys.
[47:54.650 --> 47:56.030]  We can do that or we can just hang out and chat.
[47:56.290 --> 47:58.190]  I kind of want to just hang out and chat.
[47:58.270 --> 47:59.030]  But it's up to you guys.
[47:59.090 --> 48:01.250]  Because I can just throw up the show logo.
[48:01.250 --> 48:03.870]  And we're good. We're just chilling.
[48:04.850 --> 48:06.290]  You want to just talk with the chat?
[48:07.310 --> 48:08.430]  I almost got abducted.
[48:09.930 --> 48:11.070]  That's not helpful, Gavin.
[48:12.470 --> 48:15.190]  Somebody has to say something based on what I just said.
[48:16.070 --> 48:18.190]  Let's watch a Dodds commercial.
[48:18.410 --> 48:19.330]  I don't even know what that means.
[48:19.450 --> 48:21.910]  A lot of people are saying GTA.
[48:22.190 --> 48:23.170]  We're definitely not doing that.
[48:23.830 --> 48:24.430]  You're not kidding.
[48:27.490 --> 48:28.990]  Watch car crash videos.
[48:28.990 --> 48:30.050]  Here we go.
[48:31.830 --> 48:32.630]  DrHugoGames says,
[48:32.750 --> 48:35.970]  Eric, did you enjoy all the Twitch clips from Bingo?
[48:36.830 --> 48:38.770]  You can do a three round though, Kanye.
[48:39.290 --> 48:40.310]  I thought they were awesome.
[48:40.430 --> 48:41.790]  I thought the Twitch clips were great.
[48:42.290 --> 48:43.830]  I thought the Twitch clips were really good.
[48:44.170 --> 48:47.430]  I thought they were a lot of fun.
[48:48.630 --> 48:53.490]  And the handshake thing was so legitimately funny.
[48:54.930 --> 48:56.570]  I don't know another way to put that.
[48:56.670 --> 48:57.390]  That was hilarious.
[48:57.390 --> 48:58.470]  It was so cool.
[48:58.730 --> 48:59.490]  It was so great.
[48:59.810 --> 49:00.550]  It was.
[49:00.630 --> 49:01.510]  It was so heartwarming.
[49:02.450 --> 49:04.530]  I slowed it down later and said it to Eric.
[49:04.690 --> 49:05.150]  He did.
[49:05.210 --> 49:06.390]  I woke up to that text.
[49:06.730 --> 49:09.310]  I went to bed 15 minutes after we ended.
[49:09.590 --> 49:12.510]  I didn't realize I was so tired.
[49:12.650 --> 49:13.470]  I was exhausted.
[49:13.890 --> 49:17.170]  Hey, Andrew, I got one from Brittany Deer.
[49:17.590 --> 49:21.330]  Any tease on what the next game for Fuck Faceoff is?
[49:23.550 --> 49:25.750]  Is that a secret to be kept?
[49:25.750 --> 49:27.190]  I don't know, is it?
[49:27.570 --> 49:28.050]  I don't know.
[49:28.570 --> 49:30.550]  I think keeping it a secret is fun.
[49:30.690 --> 49:32.110]  If you want to get specific about it.
[49:32.190 --> 49:34.990]  I think you can talk around it.
[49:34.990 --> 49:36.330]  It's a North American sport.
[49:37.090 --> 49:37.590]  There you go.
[49:38.030 --> 49:38.430]  Whoa.
[49:41.730 --> 49:42.250]  It's not.
[49:42.930 --> 49:43.910]  It's one of the big four.
[49:44.790 --> 49:45.590]  Which province?
[49:47.450 --> 49:47.850]  Serbia.
[49:47.850 --> 49:48.050]  Yeah.
[49:58.780 --> 50:01.020]  A lot of people are
[50:01.920 --> 50:02.920]  picking pickleball.
[50:03.080 --> 50:04.620]  It's definitely not pickleball.
[50:05.180 --> 50:07.520]  Although Gavin expressed interest in playing pickleball recently.
[50:07.640 --> 50:08.220]  So maybe we will.
[50:09.100 --> 50:10.000]  I don't really know what it is.
[50:10.300 --> 50:12.480]  Although I have seen a lot of other podcasts
[50:12.480 --> 50:14.900]  film shit like
[50:15.420 --> 50:17.720]  tennis and it doesn't
[50:17.720 --> 50:19.440]  read well on camera.
[50:19.580 --> 50:21.440]  Why would it read well?
[50:21.440 --> 50:21.700]  Yeah.
[50:21.940 --> 50:24.400]  There was no need for this.
[50:24.800 --> 50:27.440]  I can't imagine us doing anything in pickleball
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.180]  that would be filmed.
[50:29.740 --> 50:31.260]  It's not fun to play
[50:31.260 --> 50:32.440]  and it's not fun to watch.
[50:32.800 --> 50:34.120]  Why would anyone want to see that?
[50:34.240 --> 50:35.120]  Definitely fun to play.
[50:36.440 --> 50:38.200]  I think it's just like
[50:38.860 --> 50:41.000]  tennis that you're capable of doing.
[50:43.680 --> 50:44.160]  Helipolisage
[50:44.160 --> 50:45.240]  says The Purge.
[50:45.460 --> 50:46.180]  Yeah, we could play that.
[50:47.720 --> 50:49.160]  Geoff, are you a pool guy?
[50:49.160 --> 50:49.760]  Not swimming.
[50:51.720 --> 50:53.340]  Billiards. Pocket or otherwise.
[50:53.660 --> 50:54.820]  Yeah, I like pool a lot.
[50:55.700 --> 50:57.080]  Did you play a lot when you go to
[50:57.080 --> 50:58.060]  bars and stuff like that?
[50:58.200 --> 51:00.900]  I used to back in the day. Pool was how I got
[51:00.900 --> 51:03.240]  through my first divorce. Honestly.
[51:03.340 --> 51:04.000]  Oh wow, really?
[51:04.900 --> 51:06.740]  Is it the same etiquette where you have to
[51:06.740 --> 51:08.760]  put a quid on the pool table to
[51:08.760 --> 51:09.580]  know you're next?
[51:09.880 --> 51:10.080]  Yeah.
[51:12.480 --> 51:14.800]  Did you go to the Grand and stuff or what?
[51:15.060 --> 51:16.440]  I used to go to the Grand every once in a while
[51:16.440 --> 51:17.780]  but I would go to casino.
[51:18.220 --> 51:20.400]  You'd get to casino early enough and then there'd be
[51:20.400 --> 51:22.600]  two pool tables upstairs. You could snake one of those
[51:22.600 --> 51:24.060]  and then you'd just play all night.
[51:24.260 --> 51:25.700]  Also, the
[51:26.600 --> 51:28.660]  Alamo Ritz used to just be the Ritz
[51:28.660 --> 51:30.200]  and they had like
[51:30.900 --> 51:32.560]  six pool tables
[51:32.560 --> 51:34.280]  there and so I would go there a lot as well.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.040]  I don't like pool halls
[51:36.040 --> 51:38.400]  because pool halls are kind of, and I don't mean
[51:38.400 --> 51:40.180]  this, in my experience,
[51:40.280 --> 51:42.440]  pool halls are always kind of
[51:42.440 --> 51:44.080]  seedy and a little sketchy.
[51:44.080 --> 51:45.320]  They are.
[51:46.680 --> 51:47.960]  Especially the Grand.
[51:48.500 --> 51:49.320]  It is
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.020]  the only bar like that in Austin.
[51:52.060 --> 51:54.040]  And that's the cool one.
[51:54.240 --> 51:56.140]  You go to Slick Willy's or those other places
[51:56.140 --> 51:57.600]  and they are not as cool as the Grand.
[51:57.760 --> 51:58.380]  You know what I mean?
[51:59.120 --> 51:59.740]  Yeah, absolutely.
[52:01.160 --> 52:03.680]  I think the only time I've played pool
[52:03.680 --> 52:05.060]  at casino,
[52:05.580 --> 52:07.300]  it's only been once or twice.
[52:07.940 --> 52:09.880]  Most of the time, it is
[52:10.920 --> 52:11.720]  we'll put
[52:12.460 --> 52:13.740]  like a bottle cap
[52:13.740 --> 52:15.480]  or something in the middle of the table
[52:15.480 --> 52:17.880]  and then we're all flipping our bottle caps at it
[52:17.880 --> 52:18.460]  and
[52:19.480 --> 52:21.560]  you do that, you know, whoever wins or whatever
[52:21.560 --> 52:23.640]  gets a free drink on the next round of like
[52:24.080 --> 52:25.680]  five out of seven, something like that.
[52:25.820 --> 52:27.560]  Just trying to get stuff closest.
[52:27.740 --> 52:29.360]  It's something to do with a pool table, it's not pool.
[52:29.620 --> 52:30.960]  And when there's no one at that bar,
[52:31.480 --> 52:32.460]  that's a great time for it.
[52:33.360 --> 52:34.600]  That sounds fun, I want to play that.
[52:35.180 --> 52:37.160]  Yeah, I think pool is just too, it gets too involved
[52:37.160 --> 52:39.580]  and it's only like two people or four people and it's like
[52:39.580 --> 52:41.120]  this is fun, but also
[52:41.120 --> 52:43.900]  it wears its fun out
[52:43.900 --> 52:45.000]  when everyone's bad.
[52:45.320 --> 52:47.720]  I think part of it for me, I played it a lot in the army
[52:47.720 --> 52:49.660]  because there was always a pool table
[52:50.340 --> 52:51.740]  in like every common area
[52:51.740 --> 52:53.580]  and a lot of times you were just trapped
[52:53.580 --> 52:56.220]  and there was nowhere else to go, you know, and this is pre-internet.
[52:56.940 --> 52:57.800]  So like if you don't
[52:57.800 --> 52:59.780]  have internet, you're going to read a book
[52:59.780 --> 53:01.300]  or you're going to play solitaire
[53:01.300 --> 53:03.560]  or you're going to play pool by yourself, you know, there's not much else to do.
[53:04.300 --> 53:05.640]  Can I show you guys something
[53:05.640 --> 53:06.800]  really quick on the Xbox Live?
[53:06.800 --> 53:08.800]  Eric, could you bring back gameplay for a second?
[53:09.540 --> 53:10.560]  Yeah, what do you want me to do?
[53:10.700 --> 53:11.420]  Go to home.
[53:12.380 --> 53:14.440]  Okay. And then
[53:14.440 --> 53:16.240]  go up to the store.
[53:17.440 --> 53:17.960]  Okay.
[53:18.560 --> 53:21.040]  And then search from the store
[53:21.040 --> 53:22.360]  and put in
[53:22.360 --> 53:24.040]  Gavino Space Free.
[53:25.140 --> 53:25.400]  What?
[53:26.380 --> 53:27.780]  Why? I want to show you something.
[53:28.220 --> 53:30.500]  Is Gavin's name?
[53:31.000 --> 53:31.940]  Why is it a space?
[53:32.820 --> 53:33.480]  Like that?
[53:33.480 --> 53:35.200]  I don't know.
[53:35.200 --> 53:37.200]  Just Gavino Space and then Free.
[53:38.460 --> 53:39.520]  And then search.
[53:40.460 --> 53:42.220]  And then tab over to apps.
[53:43.540 --> 53:44.180]  Okay.
[53:44.520 --> 53:46.300]  And then start scrolling down.
[53:47.220 --> 53:47.860]  Why?
[53:48.400 --> 53:49.980]  And you're going to find one eventually.
[53:50.440 --> 53:51.300]  Are these my apps?
[53:51.480 --> 53:52.820]  Called Freelancer Jobs.
[53:53.460 --> 53:55.320]  Are you sure it's not Cold Sore Cure?
[53:55.840 --> 53:57.080]  I'm pretty sure that's what we're looking for.
[53:58.700 --> 53:59.980]  Freelance Jobs?
[53:59.980 --> 54:01.060]  Freelance Jobs?
[54:01.720 --> 54:02.280]  No, keep going.
[54:04.020 --> 54:05.700]  It's near the bottom for me.
[54:06.120 --> 54:07.700]  Oh, okay. I'm still looking. I'm going.
[54:07.980 --> 54:08.780]  Meme Generator?
[54:09.480 --> 54:10.040]  What?
[54:11.660 --> 54:13.440]  Look at the Gavin looking motherfucker.
[54:14.400 --> 54:15.260]  What the fuck?
[54:16.660 --> 54:17.860]  Am I getting paid for that?
[54:17.880 --> 54:18.400]  That's awesome.
[54:20.560 --> 54:21.680]  Let's get it.
[54:22.320 --> 54:22.740]  Why?
[54:24.420 --> 54:25.300]  That's you.
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.180]  Dude, how did you find this, Andrew?
[54:28.180 --> 54:29.580]  I just searched.
[54:29.760 --> 54:32.080]  I was trying to find something related to Gavin.
[54:32.380 --> 54:33.740]  And I just put his name in.
[54:33.840 --> 54:35.000]  To see what would pop up.
[54:35.620 --> 54:36.460]  Freelancer Jobs.
[54:37.600 --> 54:39.000]  That is insane.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.460]  We should see what this is.
[54:41.600 --> 54:43.940]  Let's see what I get up to.
[54:44.580 --> 54:44.900]  There you go.
[54:44.960 --> 54:45.540]  I want to see.
[54:47.140 --> 54:48.380]  There's one screenshot.
[54:48.780 --> 54:49.900]  It's just of you.
[54:50.140 --> 54:52.840]  And now, somebody can screenshot this,
[54:53.220 --> 54:55.700]  grab it, and that can be a new emote for the channel.
[54:55.700 --> 54:57.760]  Yeah, that's our next emote right there.
[54:57.920 --> 54:58.980]  Yeah, absolutely.
[54:59.300 --> 55:01.980]  That's GavinHowToWork1 on our YouTube channel.
[55:02.240 --> 55:02.480]  Pitten.
[55:03.680 --> 55:04.220]  Wow.
[55:04.660 --> 55:05.860]  What the hell?
[55:07.500 --> 55:08.520]  That's crazy.
[55:08.820 --> 55:10.520]  It's really weird and dumb.
[55:11.500 --> 55:12.100]  Wow.
[55:13.320 --> 55:15.540]  Anyways, 1-800-MAGIC on this thing or what?
[55:16.060 --> 55:17.700]  Dude, you've been fucking...
[55:19.080 --> 55:19.680]  stolen.
[55:22.860 --> 55:23.460]  Wow.
[55:25.940 --> 55:27.520]  If I just put in Rooster Teeth,
[55:27.640 --> 55:28.220]  it would pull this up.
[55:28.240 --> 55:29.400]  I'm doing the same thing!
[55:32.600 --> 55:34.300]  I'm doing the exact same thing.
[55:34.760 --> 55:35.720]  Best of Rooster Teeth.
[55:35.920 --> 55:36.840]  Animated Adventures 2.
[55:37.300 --> 55:39.740]  I wonder at what point they'll
[55:39.740 --> 55:41.080]  delist the app.
[55:41.420 --> 55:42.360]  Ooh, Rock Band.
[55:43.920 --> 55:45.560]  You got a song in Rock Band 4?
[55:45.700 --> 55:46.840]  Pulling Teeth by Green Day.
[55:47.020 --> 55:47.260]  Nope.
[55:48.780 --> 55:50.840]  There probably was...
[55:50.840 --> 55:52.940]  Rooster by Alice in Chains.
[55:54.180 --> 55:55.920]  Dynasty Warrior 9's
[55:55.920 --> 55:56.740]  additional weapons?
[55:57.160 --> 55:58.420]  There probably was like a Ruby
[55:58.790 --> 56:00.700]  or Red vs. Blue song in at some point.
[56:01.160 --> 56:02.640]  There you go. A Rooster Teeth
[56:02.640 --> 56:05.020]  Animated Adventures 2. The movie Teeth.
[56:05.460 --> 56:06.680]  Oh, Kung Fu Rooster.
[56:07.040 --> 56:08.140]  Wasn't that about Fudge?
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.840]  Eleven Little Roosters is on here.
[56:10.920 --> 56:11.440]  There's Gavin.
[56:11.840 --> 56:15.020]  That lady in Teeth, I just saw her in the Menendez Brothers movie.
[56:15.960 --> 56:16.420]  Oh, really?
[56:16.760 --> 56:18.260]  Was Teeth filmed in Austin?
[56:18.760 --> 56:19.700]  Yeah, just outside Austin.
[56:20.320 --> 56:21.400]  Is Teeth the most
[56:21.400 --> 56:22.760]  disappointing movie you've ever seen?
[56:23.240 --> 56:24.900]  Dude, I'll be honest, I don't remember it at all.
[56:25.760 --> 56:27.540]  It has to be one of the most
[56:27.540 --> 56:29.240]  disappointing movies I've ever seen.
[56:29.600 --> 56:30.100]  I never saw it.
[56:30.960 --> 56:33.060]  Nobody's dick gets chomped off Teeth style.
[56:33.420 --> 56:33.860]  Oh, no.
[56:34.500 --> 56:36.840]  Yeah, you don't see it, they don't show it, it never happens.
[56:36.980 --> 56:38.340]  Not even like a little circumcision?
[56:39.620 --> 56:41.680]  Dude, they tease it so many times
[56:41.680 --> 56:43.080]  and then it just doesn't...
[56:43.080 --> 56:45.100]  I think it happens at the end,
[56:45.200 --> 56:47.460]  nothing gets shown. You want to see it, nothing gets shown.
[56:47.980 --> 56:49.260]  Who gets money
[56:49.260 --> 56:50.580]  if somebody buys this?
[56:50.760 --> 56:53.180]  I have no fucking clue. Warner Brothers, I assume.
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.040]  Oh, dude, hell yeah. Episodes of Ballers?
[56:55.080 --> 56:57.060]  I bet nobody
[56:57.460 --> 56:59.080]  knows. I bet nobody knows.
[56:59.220 --> 57:00.880]  I bet it just shows up in an account and somebody goes,
[57:00.960 --> 57:02.160]  I don't know what the fuck this is.
[57:02.340 --> 57:05.960]  Oh, dude, Episodes of Long Island Medium?
[57:06.400 --> 57:06.980]  We'll call Sal.
[57:13.600 --> 57:15.400]  Man, this is how I used to watch TV
[57:15.400 --> 57:16.880]  for a while back in the old days.
[57:17.340 --> 57:19.340]  Really? Yeah. On the Xbox store?
[57:19.460 --> 57:20.200]  Xbox store.
[57:20.820 --> 57:22.880]  You probably have the biggest Xbox
[57:23.360 --> 57:24.820]  digital library of anyone I know.
[57:25.020 --> 57:25.740]  I might, yeah.
[57:26.440 --> 57:29.060]  I have like the first eight seasons of
[57:29.060 --> 57:31.220]  Always Sunny and all kinds of stuff on here.
[57:31.860 --> 57:32.340]  Episodes...
[57:33.520 --> 57:34.960]  Ross, the Friends,
[57:35.060 --> 57:35.940]  the one with Ross's teeth.
[57:37.200 --> 57:37.860]  Not available.
[57:38.780 --> 57:39.340]  Oh, man.
[57:41.200 --> 57:42.180]  What about this one?
[57:42.900 --> 57:43.780]  Not available.
[57:47.200 --> 57:48.580]  The best of Ross.
[57:51.620 --> 57:53.980]  So this is just stuff with Rooster or teeth
[57:53.980 --> 57:55.360]  in the show title, I guess, huh?
[57:56.740 --> 57:58.100]  I guess so.
[57:59.900 --> 58:01.040]  Oh, cool, Married with Children.
[58:01.520 --> 58:03.120]  Tooth and Consequences. That's close.
[58:03.280 --> 58:04.680]  And the app is gone?
[58:06.100 --> 58:07.140]  The Rooster Teeth app?
[58:08.780 --> 58:10.080]  There's not even a place to search
[58:10.080 --> 58:10.840]  apps on here, dude.
[58:12.200 --> 58:14.040]  This is just games, add-ons, movies
[58:14.040 --> 58:16.080]  and TV. Yeah, there's a different
[58:16.080 --> 58:18.120]  place to search apps, I guess. Should be in the store,
[58:18.180 --> 58:19.780]  though. Oh, there is? Yeah.
[58:19.960 --> 58:21.840]  I'm in the store. Hippie.
[58:22.140 --> 58:23.460]  Apps? Vegan.
[58:25.540 --> 58:25.900]  Okay.
[58:26.760 --> 58:28.100]  Just go search? Yeah.
[58:38.700 --> 58:39.920]  That's it, dude. It's gone?
[58:41.820 --> 58:42.740]  Wow. Just like
[58:42.740 --> 58:43.060]  that.
[58:46.280 --> 58:47.300]  Dude, this is unrated.
[58:47.860 --> 58:49.660]  I searched your name, Eric, and one of the
[58:49.660 --> 58:51.560]  things is Lady Gaga's Poker Face
[58:51.560 --> 58:52.800]  sung by Eric Cartman.
[58:53.560 --> 58:55.760]  Awesome. It's a Rock Band 4 DLC.
[58:56.300 --> 58:57.500]  Dude, we're gonna get copyright
[58:57.500 --> 58:58.780]  struck for playing this, don't it?
[58:59.100 --> 59:01.260]  Aw, man! I just wanna watch some
[59:01.260 --> 59:03.080]  Hey, alright! Jordan Swears!
[59:05.300 --> 59:06.620]  Uh, it's Gavin.
[59:07.040 --> 59:08.720]  Ooh, Geoff, I don't see your name on here, dude.
[59:09.240 --> 59:11.080]  Uh, that's fine. Oh, there you go!
[59:11.380 --> 59:12.560]  I'm back there somewhere, probably.
[59:12.560 --> 59:13.600]  Oh, there I am!
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.200]  Pulling up the rear.
[59:15.780 --> 59:18.740]  At least I get a billing in front of Gus.
[59:19.120 --> 59:20.100]  In front of Gus.
[59:21.160 --> 59:22.780]  I think that would make
[59:22.780 --> 59:23.800]  him mad.
[59:23.960 --> 59:26.500]  I guarantee you, he's mad right now, he doesn't know why.
[59:26.780 --> 59:28.160]  He just got a little bit angrier
[59:28.160 --> 59:30.680]  throughout his day, and he doesn't understand where it came from.
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.820]  He got a little twinge in the vein in his head.
[59:33.340 --> 59:34.060]  Oh, man.
[59:34.540 --> 59:36.040]  Uh, well, guys,
[59:37.360 --> 59:38.160]  we are
[59:38.160 --> 59:39.880]  getting on to closing time.
[59:39.880 --> 59:41.340]  This has been fun.
[59:41.480 --> 59:44.080]  We played some trivia. We played with you guys.
[59:44.240 --> 59:45.880]  We did an awesome
[59:45.880 --> 59:48.100]  stream of Sloppy Joe's Bingo last night.
[59:48.580 --> 59:50.240]  Uh, you can watch
[59:50.240 --> 59:52.160]  that on the Regulation Podcast
[59:52.160 --> 59:53.960]  channel. I think by the time this
[59:53.960 --> 59:56.160]  VOD is up, it will be up
[59:56.160 --> 59:58.020]  uh, later.
[59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.020]  Or, I'm sorry, by the time
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.840]  this is up, Sloppy Joe's Bingo
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.260]  will already be up, I believe.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.120]  So, go back, watch that,
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.100]  check it out, and uh,
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.020]  yeah, this has been good. Every Friday
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.500]  we're here until 5.01
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.960]  PM, baby.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.700]  That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.720]  Best time of the week. That's it.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.500]  You know why? Because it's quitting time.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.240]  Friday, 5.01. That's what I'm talking about.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.080]  Uh, guys, thank you so much
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.000]  for joining us. I've been in the Gears of War
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.220]  minds all day, fucking toiling away.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.200]  You guys are crazy.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.260]  That's a Patreon series,
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.480]  but it's for free, right?
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.320]  It is. Yeah, you just watch it on Patreon.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.220]  I think episode three
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.380]  is out, and today we recorded episode seven.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:41.500]  Wild.
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.640]  Yeah, if you ever want to watch us play Gears of War 5,
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.380]  Andrew, Gavin, and I,
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.260]  we're doing the entire series on
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.840]  Inconceivable, which is the hardest
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.300]  difficulty, and we're going for every
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.380]  side mission and collectible as
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.560]  we do it, for some reason.
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.240]  It is free, it's not
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.240]  on YouTube, though, it's just, that's our
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.540]  clever way to trick you to going over to Patreon.
