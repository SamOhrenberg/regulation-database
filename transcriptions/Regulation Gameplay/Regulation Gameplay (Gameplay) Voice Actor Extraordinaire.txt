[00:00.000 --> 00:01.600]  All right, Eric, you voice this creature.
[00:01.720 --> 00:02.920]  This is you for the rest of the game now.
[00:03.080 --> 00:05.440]  Oh, let me see what's going on with the tree.
[00:05.680 --> 00:08.280]  Oh, let me, uh, the mushrooms, everybody.
[00:08.660 --> 00:11.600]  Oh, today the porzingis flower.
[00:11.940 --> 00:15.480]  OK, let me let me just walk right by this thing.
[00:15.680 --> 00:18.720]  Oh, everybody knows the most delicious flowers
[00:18.720 --> 00:20.600]  grow at the highest parts of this tree.
[00:21.160 --> 00:22.040]  I'm going low.
[00:22.240 --> 00:24.240]  Oh, no. Oh, da bird.
[00:24.700 --> 00:25.820]  It's da bird.
[00:26.060 --> 00:27.640]  He's back to get me.
[00:27.640 --> 00:29.340]  But I can't... No.
[00:30.180 --> 00:31.660]  No, I can't...

[00:37.120 --> 00:38.880]  Oh, there's an exploding bowel bun.
