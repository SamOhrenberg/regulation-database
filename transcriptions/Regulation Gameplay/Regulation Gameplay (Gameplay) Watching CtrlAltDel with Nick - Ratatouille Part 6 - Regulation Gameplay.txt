[00:00.000 --> 00:03.300]  Hello and welcome to Ratatouille part six.
[00:03.860 --> 00:07.420]  We're still in Little Kitchen, Big City,
[00:08.660 --> 00:10.140]  whatever it's called.
[00:10.560 --> 00:13.220]  Petty! The Kurt Russell movie.
[00:14.220 --> 00:15.780]  Is that what it's a reference to?
[00:15.840 --> 00:17.180]  What is it? It feels like a reference.
[00:18.240 --> 00:18.340]  Problem.
[00:19.080 --> 00:21.600]  Little Kitchen, Big Chef feels or whatever.
[00:21.880 --> 00:24.740]  Little, Little, Little Chef, Big Kitchen feels like a reference
[00:25.380 --> 00:27.540]  to Big Trouble and Little China or whatever.
[00:27.600 --> 00:28.540]  I think it's just saying
[00:28.540 --> 00:30.140]  I think it's just saying big and little.
[00:31.600 --> 00:33.260]  Yeah, but what about Little People, Big World?
[00:33.800 --> 00:35.540]  That was a show at this time that was popular.
[00:35.960 --> 00:37.940]  Then? In 2007?
[00:38.040 --> 00:39.400]  Yeah, 2007. Yeah.
[00:39.520 --> 00:40.120]  Really? TLC?
[00:40.580 --> 00:42.220]  No way. Little People, Big World.
[00:42.320 --> 00:42.980]  I'm looking it up.
[00:44.480 --> 00:47.760]  It's a bunch about dwarves that live on a farm.
[00:48.620 --> 00:49.980]  And I think they still make it.
[00:49.980 --> 00:50.740]  Oh wow, 2006.
[00:52.020 --> 00:53.460]  Yeah, that was big at the time.
[00:55.880 --> 00:56.560]  Hi, Nick.
[00:56.560 --> 00:58.740]  You guys don't remember Little People, Big World?
[00:59.100 --> 01:00.380]  Hi, Nick. Welcome to Ratatouille.
[01:00.700 --> 01:01.600]  Hey, thanks. This is how it goes.
[01:02.080 --> 01:02.460]  Oh, OK.
[01:03.120 --> 01:05.580]  We have three more coins that we have to get.
[01:05.720 --> 01:07.200]  Otherwise, Geoff is going to yell at us.
[01:07.860 --> 01:09.100]  I think he's going to yell at you anyway.
[01:09.700 --> 01:10.140]  Yeah, probably.
[01:12.160 --> 01:13.160]  There you go. Wait.
[01:13.440 --> 01:15.380]  Yeah. Wait, wait, wait.
[01:15.680 --> 01:18.900]  No, I could have just turned that off the entire time.
[01:19.040 --> 01:19.800]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:21.120 --> 01:22.960]  That is insane.
[01:23.100 --> 01:24.580]  No, it's not. But I could have just done that.
[01:24.580 --> 01:26.540]  The game hands you so much.
[01:26.660 --> 01:31.980]  The game hands you so much and you just refuse to take any context clue whatsoever.
[01:32.720 --> 01:34.960]  That is incredible.
[01:35.800 --> 01:38.560]  Not that the game did that, but that we have...
[01:38.560 --> 01:41.040]  There's four videos of me navigating that smoke.
[01:41.760 --> 01:42.960]  I could have just turned it off.
[01:43.180 --> 01:44.180]  Do you think it's all smoke?
[01:44.600 --> 01:46.140]  Do you think that's smoke coming out?
[01:46.160 --> 01:46.260]  Steam.
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.500]  Oh, it's hot, Eric.
[01:48.660 --> 01:49.160]  Yeah, we're missing three coins.
[01:49.300 --> 01:50.780]  97 out of 100.
[01:50.780 --> 01:55.020]  Welcome to Little Chef Big Kitchen, Nick.
[01:55.100 --> 01:56.680]  This is the level that we need to beat.
[01:56.760 --> 02:00.120]  I believe we are one minigame shy of beating this level,
[02:00.280 --> 02:04.140]  which hopefully will give us the last three coins that we need in order to defeat it.
[02:04.660 --> 02:09.800]  Boy, I'm getting some Rady Boy flashbacks the way you're jumping down.
[02:09.960 --> 02:12.140]  I mean, I mean, this is some it's similar.
[02:12.300 --> 02:15.340]  It has it has a similar charm to it.
[02:15.660 --> 02:18.460]  So more danger. Yeah.
[02:20.780 --> 02:21.440]  Oh, my.
[02:21.520 --> 02:24.360]  Trying to see if there's any indication of like what we're missing.
[02:24.840 --> 02:26.940]  Oh, yeah. Just say, oh, yeah, keep going.
[02:27.160 --> 02:28.940]  That we're like, just like not done with it.
[02:29.480 --> 02:30.080]  How? Keep going.
[02:30.180 --> 02:31.740]  That's City Light, Staring Dash. Keep going.
[02:32.160 --> 02:34.360]  This game has so much stuff in it.
[02:34.840 --> 02:36.480]  Yeah, it's huge. This game's like insane.
[02:36.940 --> 02:38.500]  It's it's awful. It's awful.
[02:38.620 --> 02:41.480]  So I've edited four of the videos to this point.
[02:42.260 --> 02:44.300]  And every time I'm like, how?
[02:44.680 --> 02:46.360]  How are they getting longer?
[02:46.540 --> 02:47.920]  This is like the second level.
[02:48.620 --> 02:48.840]  What?
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.260]  Yeah, this is like this is insane.
[02:51.380 --> 02:53.020]  I think we're halfway through the game.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.380]  Did you see that, Andrew, where it says five to five?
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:58.160 --> 03:00.360]  No, but I don't see where it says we're missing him in here.
[03:00.440 --> 03:03.520]  I don't know. It said it said it earlier when you would like beat it.
[03:03.660 --> 03:05.200]  So I wonder if I don't know.
[03:05.300 --> 03:06.260]  I don't know what it would be.
[03:07.380 --> 03:07.740]  Wow.
[03:09.340 --> 03:10.620]  What an expensive, bless you.
[03:10.680 --> 03:11.780]  What an expansive game.
[03:12.280 --> 03:13.640]  Yeah. Yeah, it's awful.
[03:14.120 --> 03:14.740]  Oh, it's huge.
[03:15.860 --> 03:16.520]  It's terrible.
[03:16.520 --> 03:19.380]  I feel like you were enjoying yourself in the first two videos, Eric.
[03:19.580 --> 03:22.540]  And yeah, but you get to a point where you're at part six.
[03:22.580 --> 03:26.460]  Oh my God, fucking where you're you're at part six
[03:26.460 --> 03:28.180]  and you're trying to get three fucking coins
[03:28.180 --> 03:29.780]  and you don't know how to get them or where they are.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.680]  And it's kind of like a it's like a hell game.
[03:32.840 --> 03:33.780]  OK, you know.
[03:35.040 --> 03:36.620]  So the worst nightmare for a collector.
[03:36.880 --> 03:38.480]  I think I think you should go to the very top.
[03:38.760 --> 03:39.660]  I think you should go all the way up.
[03:39.900 --> 03:43.220]  I mean, it's insane that this is not a thing that we right. Right.
[03:43.320 --> 03:44.200]  What is that like a door?
[03:44.940 --> 03:45.580]  Yeah. Yeah.
[03:45.680 --> 03:46.600]  They're all over the place.
[03:46.700 --> 03:47.900]  Yeah, I think it's like for a different game,
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.900]  like a different like mini game thing that you do.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.480]  I think you got to go all the way to the top on top of the
[03:53.860 --> 03:56.880]  the burner, like not like the burners, but like the the vent hoods,
[03:56.920 --> 03:58.100]  like the very, very top of the level.
[03:59.340 --> 04:01.460]  This kitchen looks pretty accurate to the movie.
[04:03.580 --> 04:04.780]  Is that right? Kind of.
[04:05.540 --> 04:08.380]  Yeah, I think the the ovens and stuff are all lined up like that.
[04:10.020 --> 04:10.820]  You know, like a kitchen.
[04:10.960 --> 04:11.920]  I'm glad you remember that.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.840]  It's been a thing of like, we don't remember this movie.
[04:13.840 --> 04:14.600]  Yeah, at all.
[04:15.240 --> 04:17.960]  I watched it fairly recently with Archie. Hmm.
[04:19.060 --> 04:20.740]  Did you watch us play the game and you're like,
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.840]  I got to show my kid this fucking thing?
[04:22.420 --> 04:25.120]  Yeah, actually, I think it was you guys who inspired me to put it on.
[04:26.100 --> 04:26.660]  That's great.
[04:27.440 --> 04:29.600]  See, Andrew, do you think it's that one that you have to do or did you already beat it?
[04:31.940 --> 04:32.660]  Which one? Sorry.
[04:32.900 --> 04:33.400]  Nope. To the.
[04:34.960 --> 04:35.480]  Over there.
[04:37.260 --> 04:38.880]  Nick, you've watched all these, you know how this goes.
[04:38.900 --> 04:39.880]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.
[04:40.360 --> 04:42.160]  Over there. No, no. Yes.
[04:42.160 --> 04:43.900]  No. Warm, cold.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.260]  I got a cup of coffee for this because I'm like, this is going to be.
[04:48.280 --> 04:49.720]  Oh, I just I finished mine.
[04:50.020 --> 04:51.640]  Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Yeah.
[04:51.660 --> 04:52.840]  Welcome to Cakewalk.
[04:53.260 --> 04:54.200]  Oh, no.
[04:55.740 --> 04:57.700]  Three solid minutes of avoiding cake.
[04:57.940 --> 04:59.360]  This only gives you three points.
[04:59.540 --> 05:01.900]  I know. That'd be insane.
[05:02.020 --> 05:02.520]  Yes, it would.
[05:03.620 --> 05:04.840]  What is that, too little or too many?
[05:05.360 --> 05:07.340]  It's too little. You get like, I would.
[05:07.720 --> 05:08.740]  What the fuck?
[05:08.840 --> 05:10.380]  Oh, this is some Mario Party shit.
[05:10.440 --> 05:11.920]  I haven't done this. Oh my God.
[05:11.920 --> 05:12.800]  No, it's a different one.
[05:12.920 --> 05:15.620]  OK, you got to go top bottom, bottom, bottom, right?
[05:15.640 --> 05:17.300]  Bottom right. There you go.
[05:17.300 --> 05:18.980]  We're top right. There you go. There you go.
[05:19.680 --> 05:20.680]  Yeah, you got it. We got to figure out.
[05:28.020 --> 05:32.060]  You should have seen at the end of the last one, dude, you are.
[05:32.200 --> 05:32.800]  Oh, boy.
[05:33.360 --> 05:36.740]  Nick, wait till you edit the one that Geoff is on and you get to watch
[05:36.740 --> 05:39.780]  Andrew just try to beat a level that he cannot fucking beat.
[05:39.780 --> 05:42.900]  I did. Oh, oh, brother, camera.
[05:43.260 --> 05:44.640]  It's got to run at the camera.
[05:44.800 --> 05:45.640]  You got to run at the camera.
[05:45.760 --> 05:47.560]  And I guess he just didn't think of it like that.
[05:47.600 --> 05:48.960]  I don't know. There's a lot going on.
[05:49.120 --> 05:50.420]  It's the angle.
[05:50.660 --> 05:53.040]  Sometimes it's the climb tell you in ways.
[05:53.180 --> 05:54.020]  Yeah, it is the climb.
[05:54.780 --> 05:55.580]  That is true.
[05:55.880 --> 05:58.080]  Well, I guess the closest thing you got to that was when you were running
[05:58.080 --> 05:59.260]  from the old lady with the shotgun.
[05:59.860 --> 06:01.580]  Yeah. Yeah, it was one of those.
[06:01.940 --> 06:03.660]  It's definitely it's like that.
[06:03.660 --> 06:06.860]  But imagine that he can't beat it for like an extended period
[06:06.860 --> 06:08.960]  to a point where like it broke.
[06:09.100 --> 06:10.820]  Geoff or Geoff like didn't want to do this anymore.
[06:12.140 --> 06:13.620]  Forty four more seconds.
[06:13.900 --> 06:15.240]  He's just yelling, where are my coins? Where are my coins?
[06:15.660 --> 06:19.460]  Yeah, I mean, we're half we're halfway through the cake walk three right now.
[06:19.520 --> 06:20.140]  So you're doing great.
[06:21.720 --> 06:23.480]  I mean, this is this even cake?
[06:25.080 --> 06:26.580]  Yeah, these are classic cakes, you know?
[06:27.300 --> 06:28.320]  Cakes don't break like that.
[06:29.440 --> 06:30.640]  Yeah, it feels more like cookies.
[06:30.820 --> 06:33.000]  Yeah, these are like these like French cakes are different.
[06:33.560 --> 06:35.520]  Oh, that's true. Yeah.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.520]  Oh, I definitely like tea looking cakes, I guess. Right.
[06:40.780 --> 06:43.100]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh.
[06:45.240 --> 06:46.620]  Oh, oh, we won.
[06:46.720 --> 06:48.640]  Oh, my God. Right.
[06:49.220 --> 06:51.400]  Oh, you got seven seconds, six seconds.
[06:51.620 --> 06:53.280]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[06:54.400 --> 06:56.380]  And I'll take it away.
[06:58.060 --> 07:01.040]  Oh, oh, all that for a stick of butter, bud.
[07:02.080 --> 07:03.740]  You have collected, but
[07:04.780 --> 07:08.080]  hell, yeah, what the recipe?
[07:09.620 --> 07:11.780]  I think I don't know if you completed a recipe, maybe.
[07:13.480 --> 07:16.420]  So you do the mini games to get stuff to make food?
[07:17.300 --> 07:18.800]  Yeah, but we don't know what that means or does.
[07:19.340 --> 07:20.280]  OK. Yeah.
[07:21.720 --> 07:23.500]  Sweet. So hopefully that clears it up.
[07:24.020 --> 07:27.740]  This is as close as you can get to those old Super Nintendo games as you can.
[07:27.820 --> 07:28.940]  What is any kind of direction?
[07:29.120 --> 07:32.940]  Oh, no, that's I just looked and I saw it in the top right corner
[07:32.940 --> 07:34.620]  and I thought that that was.
[07:36.880 --> 07:40.240]  Oh, my God, I think I'm fucking fried, dude.
[07:41.060 --> 07:43.220]  I think I think I'm like ill.
[07:43.320 --> 07:44.060]  I think I'm sick.
[07:44.460 --> 07:46.380]  Y'all never recorded these back to back before.
[07:46.980 --> 07:48.940]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:48.960 --> 07:50.920]  We do it. Then we think about two weeks off.
[07:52.740 --> 07:55.120]  Hey, your health bar is much bigger.
[07:55.160 --> 07:55.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.060]  He every time you beat the level, you get more health.
[07:58.160 --> 07:59.760]  OK, so it's got to be.
[08:01.480 --> 08:02.780]  Around here somewhere.
[08:05.400 --> 08:07.420]  Did you just quickly look up?
[08:07.560 --> 08:09.960]  I Little City, Big Kitchen, Missable Coins.
[08:10.240 --> 08:12.640]  I already did that. OK.
[08:14.300 --> 08:16.900]  Well, what about is there an achievement for getting all the coins?
[08:17.000 --> 08:18.720]  Can you look at that achievement specifically?
[08:20.160 --> 08:23.660]  I found an old like Andrew, I found old charms like videos
[08:23.660 --> 08:25.380]  and the guy ends at 83.
[08:25.920 --> 08:29.240]  He just he does it to 83 and then he stops
[08:29.240 --> 08:30.060]  and he goes, that's it.
[08:31.020 --> 08:31.660]  What's the level?
[08:31.900 --> 08:33.500]  Dude, dude, you know what you have to do?
[08:33.620 --> 08:34.780]  Wait, go back to the main.
[08:35.040 --> 08:35.860]  Go back to your.
[08:36.820 --> 08:37.860]  Go back to the fucking game.
[08:38.020 --> 08:38.560]  Get off of this.
[08:39.800 --> 08:40.680]  One sec. One sec.
[08:41.400 --> 08:41.720]  Missable.
[08:42.100 --> 08:43.540]  I'm about to solve this.
[08:43.660 --> 08:44.360]  I'm about to solve it.
[08:44.760 --> 08:45.420]  I'm going to solve it.
[08:45.940 --> 08:47.980]  OK, OK, I'm going to leave and then you're going to solve it.
[08:48.080 --> 08:50.780]  And if you don't, then what?
[08:50.860 --> 08:52.200]  Bottom right corner on your map.
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.480]  Yeah, that is what we need to go get.
[08:57.020 --> 08:58.200]  We need to go to that.
[08:59.280 --> 09:00.380]  That's the exit.
[09:00.540 --> 09:01.340]  That's the hub exit.
[09:01.500 --> 09:04.440]  No, you didn't solve it.
[09:04.480 --> 09:05.420]  You just made us wait.
[09:05.600 --> 09:07.160]  No, no, that's got to be it.
[09:07.340 --> 09:11.280]  No, that's that's no, no, no, no.
[09:11.300 --> 09:12.800]  Sean, that's got to be it.
[09:13.080 --> 09:13.960]  We've done this.
[09:14.020 --> 09:14.920]  That's the hub symbol.
[09:16.060 --> 09:19.460]  No, Nick, you've seen the VODs, you know, you've edited this.
[09:19.540 --> 09:20.960]  You know that that's the hub symbol.
[09:21.160 --> 09:22.520]  Yeah, I think it might be.
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.600]  Oh, so back to the actual answer.
[09:28.880 --> 09:29.520]  Helpful info.
[09:30.840 --> 09:34.740]  I looked it up and it says Dishonored 2 Coin Guide.
[09:34.860 --> 09:35.620]  That's not right, right?
[09:36.560 --> 09:36.880]  No.
[09:38.600 --> 09:39.920]  All right, hold on, let me try again.
[09:40.480 --> 09:41.640]  Holy shit, I think I found it.
[09:43.380 --> 09:44.940]  Oh, oh, Andrew, I think I found it.
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.280]  I think I found the three.
[09:46.480 --> 09:47.220]  I think I found the three.
[09:47.300 --> 09:48.600]  Where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where?
[09:48.660 --> 09:53.120]  So at at the kitchen, you know, where where you do the you pull the guy's hair.
[09:53.260 --> 09:54.420]  OK, to like your left.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.280]  That's your right. There you go.
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.880]  I think down there at the bottom, there's that orange like stew pot.
[10:01.020 --> 10:01.940]  You can go behind that.
[10:02.020 --> 10:02.860]  I think there's three coins.
[10:02.860 --> 10:03.800]  Yeah, that's it.
[10:04.280 --> 10:04.940]  Teeth on the right.
[10:05.000 --> 10:05.720]  You said that's it.
[10:06.160 --> 10:06.520]  Oh.
[10:07.840 --> 10:13.250]  OK, this is fine.
[10:13.810 --> 10:14.950]  It is a faster way to get down.
[10:14.970 --> 10:17.430]  OK, hang a left, hang a left.
[10:18.670 --> 10:19.630]  Is it this way?
[10:19.990 --> 10:21.470]  No, it's going to be opposite.
[10:21.650 --> 10:22.910]  It's going to keep going, keep going, keep going.
[10:23.230 --> 10:24.710]  Oh, God damn it. Can you go this fucking way?
[10:25.010 --> 10:25.910]  It's not it's not this way.
[10:25.970 --> 10:26.830]  Please stop going this way.
[10:27.050 --> 10:27.650]  OK, OK.
[10:28.170 --> 10:29.150]  You just keep going.
[10:29.270 --> 10:31.870]  Your last instruction was to keep going the other way.
[10:32.270 --> 10:33.290]  Yeah. Get out of here.
[10:33.670 --> 10:34.930]  Why would that be the way to go?
[10:35.530 --> 10:36.810]  Well, I was trying to get out of here.
[10:36.870 --> 10:37.670]  You could squeeze through maybe.
[10:38.370 --> 10:38.810]  In real life.
[10:38.990 --> 10:41.010]  It is. Keep going.
[10:41.690 --> 10:42.690]  OK, hang a left.
[10:44.630 --> 10:47.410]  OK, go behind those pots straight ahead of you.
[10:49.270 --> 10:50.070]  To the left.
[10:51.390 --> 10:51.790]  Boom!
[10:52.510 --> 10:52.910]  Yeah!
[10:55.670 --> 10:57.710]  Oh, we should have taken a picture.
[10:57.910 --> 10:59.670]  One hundred.
[11:00.090 --> 11:00.770]  OK, wait, hang on.
[11:00.890 --> 11:03.330]  All right. And then we and then we cut all that out, guys.
[11:03.450 --> 11:07.570]  And that's how you get one hundred without even trying on this level.
[11:07.810 --> 11:08.970]  Let's go back to the hub world.
[11:09.030 --> 11:12.890]  Let's show these people another level of Ratatouille 2007.
[11:13.930 --> 11:16.470]  There's not even a specific achievement to do it.
[11:16.650 --> 11:19.190]  That is, oh, then what are we doing?
[11:19.710 --> 11:21.790]  I think there's an achievement to get all the charms.
[11:21.790 --> 11:25.490]  But like, it is crazy that they didn't give an achievement for doing it on this level
[11:25.490 --> 11:27.570]  when there is achievements for doing it on other level.
[11:28.250 --> 11:29.470]  That makes no sense.
[11:29.770 --> 11:31.190]  I hate this game. I hate the fucking rat.
[11:31.650 --> 11:32.510]  OK, let's go.
[11:33.470 --> 11:34.410]  No, you love this game.
[11:34.750 --> 11:36.270]  You love these rat games.
[11:36.710 --> 11:37.510]  This is all for you.
[11:37.930 --> 11:40.210]  I every time you seem to be having a good time, Eric.
[11:40.950 --> 11:41.150]  No.
[11:43.590 --> 11:44.830]  We're going to get to a new level.
[11:44.930 --> 11:45.610]  It's going to be great.
[11:45.770 --> 11:47.490]  Yeah. New, new level.
[11:47.690 --> 11:48.610]  I'm excited to see a new level.
[11:49.070 --> 11:49.310]  Yeah.
[11:51.030 --> 11:53.230]  We're eventually going to have to get all the coins in the hub world.
[11:53.390 --> 11:54.850]  Yeah, that's eventually, though.
[11:55.370 --> 11:56.570]  Save it for Geoff, for Gavin.
[11:58.170 --> 12:00.490]  Yeah, we're not making Gavin sit through this.
[12:00.550 --> 12:01.190]  He'd be screaming.
[12:03.350 --> 12:04.690]  I think Gavin would like this.
[12:04.770 --> 12:05.710]  Yeah, he liked Ratty Boy.
[12:07.630 --> 12:10.330]  Except for the part where it gave him a headache and he was screaming.
[12:11.190 --> 12:12.570]  Yeah, it broke him.
[12:14.690 --> 12:16.390]  Get a move on, he screamed.
[12:20.450 --> 12:20.850]  Ugh.
[12:23.910 --> 12:25.070]  Don't even need it.
[12:25.150 --> 12:25.710]  Where are you going?
[12:26.190 --> 12:27.570]  Oh, you know, I don't know.
[12:27.630 --> 12:29.090]  I'm trying to figure out where the next level is.
[12:35.520 --> 12:36.320]  What's happening?
[12:37.180 --> 12:38.860]  I'm trying to get on that wire.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.060]  Why? You have to jump and hit the button.
[12:40.880 --> 12:41.500]  There you go, see?
[12:43.020 --> 12:45.100]  Oh, I just don't know where the next level is.
[12:45.380 --> 12:46.980]  Why are these coins all different colors?
[12:47.720 --> 12:48.660]  Different, different colors.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.300]  Different colors, different levels.
[12:51.280 --> 12:51.680]  OK.
[12:52.160 --> 12:52.560]  Yeah.
[12:53.140 --> 12:54.920]  I wish the coin counter matched.
[12:54.920 --> 12:55.840]  I mean, it's definitely not that way, right?
[12:56.940 --> 12:58.320]  I mean, almost certainly not.
[13:00.100 --> 13:01.240]  So, here we go.
[13:01.660 --> 13:02.760]  And yeah, I was going to say, and yeah.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.760]  I guess what we're doing now is we are going to get all the coins in the hubble.
[13:10.800 --> 13:11.600]  Please don't.
[13:13.360 --> 13:15.180]  Wait, is that how bug spray works?
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.040]  Yeah.
[13:16.180 --> 13:17.180]  Yeah, you just put it down.
[13:18.820 --> 13:19.480]  Bugs are afraid.
[13:19.480 --> 13:21.760]  Have you not been using bug spray, right, your whole life?
[13:22.880 --> 13:23.900]  I guess not.
[13:24.060 --> 13:24.800]  I just spritz it.
[13:25.160 --> 13:26.220]  Am I supposed to do that?
[13:27.460 --> 13:28.440]  No, no, no, no.
[13:28.800 --> 13:30.100]  That's how you waste it.
[13:30.220 --> 13:33.100]  I guess it's just a constant threat.
[13:37.750 --> 13:39.310]  OK, well, let's go back.
[13:39.370 --> 13:40.550]  Let's go back to the main hub.
[13:41.270 --> 13:41.290]  OK.
[13:46.070 --> 13:48.250]  Every time you see the kid, you fucking beat him up.
[13:48.970 --> 13:49.650]  You got to.
[13:49.650 --> 13:50.590]  He's a tiny little rat.
[13:52.130 --> 13:56.450]  We need to see where the VCK came in.
[13:56.950 --> 13:58.430]  All right, so we already went that way.
[13:58.530 --> 13:59.490]  We got to maybe go up?
[14:01.450 --> 14:02.210]  There's no up.
[14:02.310 --> 14:03.350]  There is no up, you're right.
[14:04.810 --> 14:06.230]  Except for the up that's there.
[14:06.670 --> 14:08.050]  Except for the up that's there.
[14:08.210 --> 14:08.510]  You fool.
[14:09.830 --> 14:11.930]  I don't think going up is the way to go, though.
[14:11.990 --> 14:13.490]  Because this just seems like where you collect coins.
[14:13.950 --> 14:16.290]  But there is a coin there, so we should probably get it right now.
[14:16.570 --> 14:19.270]  OK, so Nick is all for us collecting all the coins in the hubble.
[14:19.270 --> 14:20.350]  Not all, just some.
[14:21.470 --> 14:22.830]  All right, I take it back.
[14:23.570 --> 14:23.670]  Yeah.
[14:24.050 --> 14:25.570]  There has to be something up here.
[14:26.650 --> 14:28.750]  Guys, there has to be something up here.
[14:29.130 --> 14:30.430]  Oh my God, Andrew.
[14:30.570 --> 14:33.130]  Why do you keep walking so far forward and then jumping?
[14:34.350 --> 14:35.270]  Because it's not...
[14:36.850 --> 14:38.450]  You can double jump to go higher.
[14:40.270 --> 14:41.530]  Sometimes you hit...
[14:41.530 --> 14:44.110]  Oh my God, I was not expecting that to happen.
[14:45.370 --> 14:45.810]  There.
[14:45.810 --> 14:46.970]  Oh God, higher.
[14:50.110 --> 14:50.530]  There.
[14:50.630 --> 14:51.070]  That's a level.
[14:52.350 --> 14:54.590]  Oh, look who found a level.
[14:54.970 --> 14:55.570]  Wow, I helped.
[14:56.830 --> 14:59.630]  I was the one that said go up, so it's all on me, but whatever.
[15:00.570 --> 15:02.070]  You did, then you wanted to bail out.
[15:04.310 --> 15:05.830]  Still be running around the hub.
[15:05.910 --> 15:06.170]  Yeah.
[15:06.450 --> 15:06.870]  I'm listening to you, Eric.
[15:08.810 --> 15:09.690]  He's hubbing it up.
[15:10.390 --> 15:12.430]  Nick doesn't want that. Nick wants a level.
[15:12.430 --> 15:13.870]  I want action. Adventure.
[15:14.890 --> 15:15.830]  More coin collecting.
[15:16.390 --> 15:19.210]  We also need a new level because we need new bonus content.
[15:19.450 --> 15:20.330]  Oh, that's right.
[15:20.410 --> 15:22.070]  We're pretty dry on bonus content.
[15:22.470 --> 15:24.630]  And we don't have any 1-800-MAGIC left to watch.
[15:25.130 --> 15:25.770]  Oh, did you finish it?
[15:25.890 --> 15:27.330]  We'll figure out something else to watch.
[15:27.650 --> 15:31.330]  Yeah, Geoff didn't love it.
[15:31.850 --> 15:32.370]  Oh, no?
[15:32.810 --> 15:34.230]  No. This level's insane.
[15:34.350 --> 15:36.570]  Okay, so are we coin collecting or are we doing mini-games?
[15:41.970 --> 15:42.410]  Let's...
[15:42.410 --> 15:44.510]  Because when we do one or the other,
[15:44.670 --> 15:46.530]  like, if we do the mixie move,
[15:46.750 --> 15:47.530]  we get fucking lost.
[15:47.910 --> 15:48.610]  It's really bad.
[15:56.340 --> 16:01.720]  Is that a crab throwing shit at you?
[16:01.780 --> 16:02.880]  What the fuck?
[16:03.300 --> 16:03.960]  Or is it a lobster?
[16:05.880 --> 16:06.780]  Oh my god.
[16:06.860 --> 16:07.540]  Watch out for the lobster.
[16:08.100 --> 16:10.260]  He can't pinch you, but just look out, you know?
[16:11.940 --> 16:13.160]  There are these holes again.
[16:13.240 --> 16:14.360]  There's nothing you can do to the holes.
[16:14.440 --> 16:14.920]  It's crazy.
[16:18.120 --> 16:19.120]  He's gonna see you.
[16:19.920 --> 16:21.460]  No, I don't think you are.
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.080]  Okay, okay.
[16:28.440 --> 16:28.840]  Anyway...
[16:28.840 --> 16:31.040]  Did that say rats and water don't mix?
[16:31.560 --> 16:31.760]  Yeah.
[16:33.520 --> 16:34.220]  Sure did.
[16:35.380 --> 16:36.560]  Wait, wait, can you read the book?
[16:37.040 --> 16:37.740]  Okay, never mind.
[16:37.740 --> 16:39.380]  No, that's a mission.
[16:39.560 --> 16:40.440]  If I read the book, it's a mission.
[16:40.440 --> 16:42.740]  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was one of the ones
[16:42.740 --> 16:44.240]  that's telling you which way to go or whatever.
[16:45.360 --> 16:45.980]  Oh my god.
[16:47.220 --> 16:48.540]  I'm so far away.
[16:48.780 --> 16:49.720]  There's no way!
[16:49.960 --> 16:51.820]  How did he still see you?
[16:51.960 --> 16:54.080]  I think you have to not go in front of this guy.
[16:54.520 --> 16:55.220]  I think so.
[16:55.380 --> 16:55.820]  I'm not.
[17:00.520 --> 17:06.060]  I hate these fucking crab things.
[17:06.060 --> 17:06.960]  Yeah, it is brigarious.
[17:10.300 --> 17:12.080]  Did you ever see Planes?
[17:12.440 --> 17:14.020]  That movie sucks.
[17:15.400 --> 17:15.880]  Planes?
[17:16.120 --> 17:18.260]  My uncle worked on that.
[17:18.740 --> 17:20.240]  Oh, it's not his fault.
[17:20.380 --> 17:21.220]  It's really Dane Cook's fault.
[17:21.640 --> 17:23.860]  No, I mean, it's what happens when you work in animation.
[17:26.280 --> 17:27.440]  That's why it was familiar.
[17:27.680 --> 17:28.960]  Yeah, spin-off of Cars.
[17:29.460 --> 17:30.940]  The Dane Cook of Cars.
[17:31.360 --> 17:32.660]  Brad Garrett also in it.
[17:33.800 --> 17:34.640]  Is that right?
[17:34.720 --> 17:35.140]  I didn't know that.
[17:35.140 --> 17:39.060]  Yeah, he's like his fuel tanker buddy.
[17:41.520 --> 17:42.760]  I think that was
[17:42.760 --> 17:44.840]  straight to DVD and then Cars did really well.
[17:45.060 --> 17:46.380]  It was.
[17:46.720 --> 17:48.220]  Planes was straight to DVD.
[17:49.400 --> 17:50.160]  Yeah, Cars was great.
[17:50.160 --> 17:53.260]  It was released in theaters as well, but I think it was made straight for DVD.
[17:53.360 --> 17:53.700]  It was.
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.680]  My uncle, he just
[17:56.680 --> 17:58.860]  finished up his contract with Netflix, but he worked on
[17:59.460 --> 18:00.340]  Ultraman Rising.
[18:00.340 --> 18:02.440]  The new Ultraman
[18:02.960 --> 18:04.460]  animated show that's coming
[18:04.460 --> 18:06.280]  out. It looks fucking sick.
[18:06.860 --> 18:07.320]  That's cool.
[18:09.540 --> 18:10.600]  Almost as cool as
[18:10.600 --> 18:12.440]  Planes. Almost! It's neck
[18:12.440 --> 18:13.340]  and neck, you know what I mean?
[18:15.320 --> 18:16.420]  I just want to
[18:16.420 --> 18:17.020]  kill this guy.
[18:18.680 --> 18:19.840]  I want to get rid of him.
[18:20.660 --> 18:20.860]  Beep.
[18:22.460 --> 18:24.340]  Man, Peppers
[18:24.340 --> 18:26.080]  would really be interesting if that's what they did.
[18:27.520 --> 18:28.300]  Oh, man.
[18:28.300 --> 18:30.160]  Hot Ones would be a very different
[18:30.160 --> 18:30.480]  show.
[18:33.740 --> 18:34.280]  Imagine
[18:34.280 --> 18:36.240]  the end of every Hot Ones, their head
[18:36.240 --> 18:36.920]  explodes.
[18:39.440 --> 18:40.520]  Good luck.
[18:44.980 --> 18:45.520]  Oh,
[18:45.580 --> 18:46.940]  look at this piece of shit.
[18:47.080 --> 18:48.640]  Take his fucking lolly.
[18:49.660 --> 18:50.760]  That's so loud.
[18:51.840 --> 18:52.900]  What the...
[18:53.500 --> 18:54.040]  Yeah.
[18:54.940 --> 18:55.920]  A lot of cheese.
[18:56.280 --> 18:57.300]  There you go.
[18:57.300 --> 18:57.760]  Oh!
[18:59.040 --> 19:00.840]  And that's how you get the Tangle
[19:00.840 --> 19:03.160]  achievement of the big
[19:03.160 --> 19:04.660]  cheese, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:05.300 --> 19:06.160]  Hell yeah.
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.060]  Can you do your sniffer? Do your sniffer right.
[19:09.180 --> 19:10.720]  I want to see him spin and do his sniffer.
[19:11.660 --> 19:12.480]  That's pretty cool.
[19:13.940 --> 19:14.460]  Bonus content!
[19:17.020 --> 19:19.180]  So he's just mocking those people, right?
[19:20.300 --> 19:20.680]  Yeah.
[19:20.780 --> 19:23.360]  There it is. Bonus pack 14.
[19:23.620 --> 19:24.900]  Yeah, hell yeah. Remember that, Nick.
[19:24.900 --> 19:27.200]  Bonus pack 14. That's what you get to see.
[19:27.740 --> 19:27.900]  Oh!
[19:28.780 --> 19:30.140]  I've seen all of them, but yay!
[19:33.360 --> 19:34.380]  Alright, I wrote it down.
[19:36.580 --> 19:38.740]  What do I get? Is it this, maybe?
[19:39.760 --> 19:41.360]  Trying to figure out how to get across
[19:41.360 --> 19:42.500]  that pole.
[19:43.640 --> 19:44.180]  Oh, come on.
[19:44.420 --> 19:45.940]  Oh, there you go.
[19:48.540 --> 19:49.060]  All those
[19:49.060 --> 19:50.680]  crabs did not slip away.
[19:52.000 --> 19:52.940]  They're on ice.
[19:54.900 --> 19:56.460]  Is it like a momentum thing?
[19:57.460 --> 19:57.720]  No.
[19:59.340 --> 20:00.220]  Not a momentum.
[20:02.400 --> 20:04.960]  I am greatly intimidated by how large
[20:04.960 --> 20:06.260]  this level is. Yeah, it's a big one.
[20:06.900 --> 20:07.980]  I missed the little kitchen.
[20:09.560 --> 20:11.060]  Yeah, the little kitchen was nice.
[20:11.300 --> 20:11.580]  Whoa!
[20:15.240 --> 20:16.560]  This feels very...
[20:17.220 --> 20:18.560]  That fish in the ice felt
[20:18.560 --> 20:19.680]  very Red Dead to me.
[20:20.780 --> 20:21.220]  It did.
[20:23.600 --> 20:24.480]  Minigame unlocked!
[20:25.920 --> 20:26.320]  Hooray!
[20:29.960 --> 20:30.680]  Oh, thank God it's ice.
[20:30.740 --> 20:31.440]  I thought it was cat litter.
[20:31.620 --> 20:34.120]  Oh, man.
[20:34.620 --> 20:35.220]  Blow him up!
[20:35.760 --> 20:36.420]  This will teach you.
[20:41.620 --> 20:42.420]  Oh, man!
[20:43.680 --> 20:44.360]  You got taken out like
[20:44.360 --> 20:45.620]  Geoff Daniel in Speed.
[20:45.880 --> 20:48.320]  He realized and there's nothing
[20:48.320 --> 20:49.100]  he can do about it.
[20:50.080 --> 20:50.440]  Wow!
[20:51.700 --> 20:52.500]  Is Speed 2
[20:52.500 --> 20:54.400]  worth watching? I've never seen
[20:54.400 --> 20:56.720]  Speed 2. Never saw it. The one on the boat?
[20:57.000 --> 20:58.460]  I don't think so. The boat one, yeah.
[21:00.060 --> 21:00.680]  I feel like
[21:00.680 --> 21:02.420]  one of us should see Speed 2. I didn't expect
[21:02.420 --> 21:04.160]  all three of us to have never seen Speed 2.
[21:04.160 --> 21:06.420]  I don't think one of us needs to see Speed 2.
[21:06.500 --> 21:08.560]  I think it's fine. I'll get back to you
[21:08.560 --> 21:09.060]  on Speed 2.
[21:10.740 --> 21:12.500]  I'll do some research. I'll get the crazy
[21:12.500 --> 21:14.260]  puffs and I'll enjoy some Speed 2.
[21:14.560 --> 21:16.280]  Interesting that it happened to the
[21:16.780 --> 21:18.560]  bystander character twice as opposed to
[21:18.560 --> 21:19.460]  a cop.
[21:20.860 --> 21:21.380]  Yes!
[21:22.980 --> 21:23.500]  How?
[21:24.020 --> 21:26.660]  Wait, how long
[21:26.660 --> 21:28.120]  can I...
[21:28.120 --> 21:29.660]  I just can't.
[21:30.400 --> 21:32.400]  I'm unable to actually move
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.820]  because of the ice.
[21:36.020 --> 21:36.740]  How far am I going?
[21:37.180 --> 21:38.780]  Whoa, let's see how far it'll take you.
[21:39.060 --> 21:39.840]  Whoa, I'm just flying!
[21:40.500 --> 21:41.080]  Uh-oh!
[21:42.880 --> 21:44.240]  Back to the street.
[21:46.380 --> 21:47.540]  I feel like I'm watching
[21:47.540 --> 21:48.260]  mini-golf.
[21:48.620 --> 21:50.600]  That's exactly what it is.
[21:51.040 --> 21:51.960]  He's on the ball.
[21:53.260 --> 21:54.140]  We should play that again.
[21:56.060 --> 21:57.640]  Geoff has a different mini-golf game
[21:57.640 --> 21:58.760]  he wants to play. I'm down.
[21:58.860 --> 22:01.640]  I don't remember what it's called. What the fuck?
[22:02.320 --> 22:03.320]  You got hurt for that.
[22:03.580 --> 22:04.060]  You got hurt.
[22:04.660 --> 22:06.200]  I lost health on that? Yeah.
[22:06.400 --> 22:07.760]  Oh my God, I was trying to get around you.
[22:10.960 --> 22:11.360]  15...
[22:12.120 --> 22:12.520]  16...
[22:13.780 --> 22:14.540]  17...
[22:14.540 --> 22:15.860]  How slick is it actually, Andrew,
[22:15.960 --> 22:17.700]  when you go against it?
[22:17.720 --> 22:18.860]  It's very...
[22:18.860 --> 22:21.900]  It launches you.
[22:24.780 --> 22:26.300]  Ooh, shrimp!
[22:29.320 --> 22:30.120]  I just had some...
[22:31.240 --> 22:32.360]  Just had some
[22:32.360 --> 22:34.080]  fresh-caught gulf shrimp.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.120]  Port Aransas.
[22:37.560 --> 22:38.600]  You did.
[22:38.740 --> 22:40.400]  I ordered shrimp that night.
[22:40.400 --> 22:41.020]  Hell yeah.
[22:42.640 --> 22:44.060]  Nice po' boy sandwich.
[22:46.360 --> 22:47.360]  God, I love po' boy.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.140]  When was the last time you had shrimp, Eric?
[22:53.820 --> 22:54.260]  Probably...
[22:54.260 --> 22:55.840]  like a month or so ago.
[22:56.400 --> 22:57.840]  And we talked about it on
[22:59.100 --> 23:00.260]  100% Eat
[23:00.260 --> 23:02.280]  when we went to...
[23:02.820 --> 23:04.480]  I think me and Jordan went to a place
[23:04.480 --> 23:06.420]  called Haymaker, and the guy
[23:06.420 --> 23:08.360]  who was the kitchen manager was a fan
[23:08.360 --> 23:10.340]  of the show, and he brought
[23:10.340 --> 23:12.420]  us a thing that they were working on, which was
[23:13.640 --> 23:14.280]  a... like
[23:14.820 --> 23:16.300]  butterflied shrimp thing, and like
[23:16.300 --> 23:18.680]  this sweet teriyaki
[23:18.680 --> 23:20.060]  omelet. Oh, it was so fucking good.
[23:20.200 --> 23:22.300]  It was like, oh, it was incredible. My mouth is watering thinking about it.
[23:22.340 --> 23:24.420]  It was incredible. How big was the shrimp? Was it like the tiny
[23:24.420 --> 23:26.520]  ones, or like the bigger ones? Yeah, that's what I'm
[23:26.520 --> 23:28.440]  talking about. There were like six or something of them,
[23:28.520 --> 23:30.180]  like there were a bunch, and then it was like, fuck, dude,
[23:30.180 --> 23:32.360]  they were so good. Ooh, they were so
[23:32.360 --> 23:34.400]  good. I find my problem
[23:34.400 --> 23:36.240]  with shrimp usually is either there
[23:36.240 --> 23:38.000]  is nowhere near enough,
[23:38.940 --> 23:40.280]  or there's a thousand
[23:40.280 --> 23:42.340]  of them. I think it's
[23:42.340 --> 23:43.780]  the... for me, it's mostly there
[23:44.200 --> 23:46.060]  aren't enough. Yeah,
[23:46.320 --> 23:48.200]  totally. Yeah, and then
[23:48.200 --> 23:50.180]  it's just like, okay, give me... I need like a lot of fries
[23:50.180 --> 23:52.040]  or something then, please. Like, I need something else.
[23:52.380 --> 23:54.220]  I need something to make up the
[23:54.220 --> 23:55.440]  difference here. Yeah.
[24:00.470 --> 24:01.630]  But it's also like the
[24:01.630 --> 24:03.490]  only place in Austin, I
[24:03.490 --> 24:05.010]  think, where you can get like poutine.
[24:06.410 --> 24:07.430]  Oh, really? Oh, yeah.
[24:08.050 --> 24:08.410]  Yeah.
[24:09.450 --> 24:11.350]  It's so weird to me to think that that is
[24:11.350 --> 24:13.070]  just not a thing that's available everywhere.
[24:13.250 --> 24:15.410]  Dude, after I had it, it was weird to me
[24:15.410 --> 24:17.390]  that they didn't have it everywhere. It is a thing that
[24:17.390 --> 24:18.790]  is so fucking easy, and it's great.
[24:19.970 --> 24:21.530]  It's gotta be cheap to make. It's so good.
[24:22.550 --> 24:23.450]  Yeah, well, it's like
[24:23.930 --> 24:25.190]  every fast food chain
[24:25.190 --> 24:27.510]  where I live, you can get poutine. Whoa.
[24:28.270 --> 24:29.710]  Burger King, McDonald's,
[24:29.850 --> 24:31.110]  they all do poutine. What, for real?
[24:31.110 --> 24:32.010]  Oh, shit.
[24:33.570 --> 24:35.430]  It's very accessible. Eric, let's go.
[24:36.290 --> 24:37.830]  To Canada for poutine?
[24:38.430 --> 24:38.870]  Yeah, man.
[24:39.550 --> 24:41.910]  Well, I mean for other stuff. You can get them at the Crazy Puffs.
[24:42.590 --> 24:42.790]  Ooh.
[24:43.470 --> 24:44.910]  Eric, we can hang out with Andrew.
[24:45.470 --> 24:47.110]  We'll do some stuff. Shoot some content.
[24:47.570 --> 24:49.370]  Why, they closed down his whole city to film
[24:49.370 --> 24:50.550]  like Walking Dead or whatever.
[24:51.530 --> 24:52.050]  Well, it's done.
[24:53.090 --> 24:55.370]  That whole experience made me realize
[24:55.370 --> 24:57.190]  how ridiculous like film
[24:57.190 --> 24:58.710]  and TV production is. Oh, yeah.
[24:59.010 --> 25:01.610]  It was like two weeks
[25:01.610 --> 25:02.870]  of them building a set
[25:02.870 --> 25:04.650]  and then two weeks of them
[25:04.650 --> 25:06.970]  taking down that set for two days
[25:06.970 --> 25:07.470]  of filming.
[25:08.850 --> 25:09.830]  One road.
[25:10.550 --> 25:12.970]  Like it made me, I was thinking about watching
[25:12.970 --> 25:14.930]  The Last of Us, how many
[25:14.930 --> 25:16.590]  locations are in one episode.
[25:17.170 --> 25:19.010]  That's a good question. Completely different cities.
[25:19.410 --> 25:20.910]  Yeah. I wonder
[25:20.910 --> 25:22.890]  if that was supposed to be from like a
[25:22.890 --> 25:24.550]  flashback or if it's actually from
[25:24.550 --> 25:27.030]  like supposed to be Seattle. I think it's
[25:27.030 --> 25:28.810]  Seattle. I think it's early
[25:28.810 --> 25:30.830]  in the second game, so it'll probably be
[25:30.830 --> 25:31.870]  pretty early in the show.
[25:34.250 --> 25:34.930]  And Bella
[25:34.930 --> 25:36.150]  Ramsey on a horse.
[25:36.870 --> 25:38.890]  Oh, then yeah, probably early.
[25:42.350 --> 25:42.790]  Spoiler
[25:42.790 --> 25:44.550]  alert, that horse dies.
[25:49.750 --> 25:50.850]  You want to do
[25:50.850 --> 25:53.090]  Last of Us on hard, right, Nick? I do.
[25:53.270 --> 25:55.010]  Yeah. First one or the
[25:55.010 --> 25:56.730]  second one? Yeah, I'm thinking about maybe
[25:56.730 --> 25:58.690]  one of the streams that we do starting that.
[25:59.290 --> 26:00.070]  That'd be awesome.
[26:01.730 --> 26:02.790]  Part one or part two?
[26:03.370 --> 26:04.750]  I think we'd start with part one.
[26:05.790 --> 26:06.210]  Okay.
[26:06.570 --> 26:08.750]  But I'm down for either. I like, I love both.
[26:09.230 --> 26:10.090]  Have you
[26:10.660 --> 26:12.050]  done both or have you only done one?
[26:12.290 --> 26:14.830]  I played through Grounded on the first one
[26:14.830 --> 26:16.670]  and I started it on two, but I
[26:16.670 --> 26:17.470]  never finished it.
[26:19.030 --> 26:19.450]  Okay.
[26:20.350 --> 26:22.170]  Oh, actually I did, I pulled
[26:22.690 --> 26:24.690]  was it a Geoff or a Gavin
[26:24.690 --> 26:26.570]  when the difficulty thing for
[26:26.570 --> 26:28.670]  Gears of War, where I was like, I'm on the hardest difficulty
[26:28.670 --> 26:30.110]  and they hadn't released it yet.
[26:30.290 --> 26:32.270]  So I was just playing on a hard difficulty
[26:33.110 --> 26:34.450]  and then got to a point
[26:34.450 --> 26:36.710]  and realized my mistake and had to start all over again.
[26:37.570 --> 26:38.610]  Oh, that sucks.
[26:43.200 --> 26:44.620]  How are there not just like a million
[26:44.620 --> 26:46.480]  coins in view when you only have a quarter of them?
[26:47.160 --> 26:48.520]  Which is great, but like...
[26:48.520 --> 26:48.840]  Oh yeah.
[26:51.300 --> 26:52.720]  I think that playthrough would be fun
[26:52.720 --> 26:54.660]  though because it's going to be just me
[26:54.660 --> 26:56.840]  angry and everybody else laughing.
[26:58.820 --> 27:00.800]  Yeah, there's not a lot of just Nick
[27:00.800 --> 27:01.920]  being angry content.
[27:02.160 --> 27:04.420]  I would be interested to see what
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.780]  your gaming rage
[27:06.780 --> 27:07.640]  looks like.
[27:08.460 --> 27:10.520]  Welcome to King Melon, baby!
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.200]  Write that down, Eric.
[27:13.320 --> 27:14.620]  Wait no, Andrew, write that down.
[27:16.440 --> 27:16.980]  You found
[27:16.980 --> 27:18.820]  the pile of watermelons in the city
[27:18.820 --> 27:19.200]  market.
[27:20.240 --> 27:22.220]  And boy does he look mad about it.
[27:22.560 --> 27:24.060]  You shouldn't have found those melons.
[27:24.060 --> 27:25.860]  You shouldn't have found the King Melon.
[27:26.500 --> 27:28.120]  Oh, you found the cheese
[27:28.120 --> 27:29.860]  too? You're not supposed to find
[27:29.860 --> 27:31.960]  the big cheese. Do we need to go to the achievements
[27:31.960 --> 27:33.980]  and see what the other ones are? Like what other crazy
[27:33.980 --> 27:35.500]  foods there are in the...
[27:35.500 --> 27:36.140]  Uh, sure.
[27:38.480 --> 27:39.780]  Oh, Trojan horse radish.
[27:40.600 --> 27:41.760]  What? Oh.
[27:41.900 --> 27:42.100]  Uh-huh.
[27:43.480 --> 27:45.840]  You gotta find all three switches, bro.
[27:46.840 --> 27:48.040]  Navigate through the freezer.
[27:49.580 --> 27:50.040]  Ride
[27:50.040 --> 27:52.120]  all the platform, three platforms
[27:52.120 --> 27:53.180]  down the pole.
[27:56.260 --> 27:57.760]  Back to all three mini missions.
[27:58.280 --> 28:00.100]  Oh, find and stand in the mouth
[28:00.100 --> 28:01.880]  of the giant fish. Okay, alright, we gotta
[28:01.880 --> 28:02.680]  find the giant fish.
[28:03.380 --> 28:05.160]  Chili sauce! Hot stuff!
[28:06.480 --> 28:06.960]  Hot ones.
[28:07.920 --> 28:09.760]  Navigate across the lobster tanks.
[28:09.960 --> 28:11.560]  Oh, there's a lot. Okay.
[28:12.220 --> 28:13.980]  Let's focus on the chili
[28:13.980 --> 28:15.880]  sauce and the fish. You got
[28:15.880 --> 28:16.040]  it.
[28:16.240 --> 28:19.800]  I mean, we saw
[28:19.800 --> 28:21.960]  the chili sauce before, I feel like.
[28:26.860 --> 28:27.320]  Oh, I'm all
[28:27.320 --> 28:29.300]  turned around now because of the melon thing.
[28:30.260 --> 28:31.420]  Let's just get this coin.
[28:31.920 --> 28:33.500]  While we're here. Yeah, every time
[28:33.500 --> 28:35.460]  I hear, uh...
[28:35.460 --> 28:37.060]  What's his name talk?
[28:37.440 --> 28:39.180]  Uh, why can't I think of his name?
[28:39.600 --> 28:41.220]  Patton Oswalt? Yeah, Patton Oswalt talk.
[28:41.540 --> 28:43.420]  I'm always reminded of his character from
[28:43.420 --> 28:45.400]  Justified and how much of
[28:45.400 --> 28:47.460]  a goober he is. Was he on Justified?
[28:47.940 --> 28:49.440]  Yeah. Yeah, he was like in season
[28:50.340 --> 28:51.500]  four or five.
[28:52.600 --> 28:53.520]  He's like a
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.420]  constable that was elected in or something.
[28:55.420 --> 28:57.820]  And he's
[28:57.820 --> 28:59.860]  like one of these guys that's like, I wanna go on a mission!
[28:59.980 --> 29:01.500]  And he's got this piece of shit like, uh...
[29:02.660 --> 29:04.000]  gremlin looking car.
[29:04.740 --> 29:05.900]  And he tries to back up
[29:05.900 --> 29:07.020]  Raylan wherever he goes.
[29:07.660 --> 29:08.620]  But he's always in the way.
[29:10.640 --> 29:11.600]  The well-meaning
[29:11.600 --> 29:13.560]  incompetent cop rule.
[29:14.140 --> 29:14.220]  Yeah.
[29:15.640 --> 29:17.780]  But it works somehow for the show. Oh, interesting.
[29:17.820 --> 29:19.320]  Where's the giant fish and the chili sauce?
[29:20.860 --> 29:21.860]  Get in his mouth.
[29:22.200 --> 29:23.740]  Now. We're looking
[29:23.740 --> 29:25.060]  in there. Now.
[29:26.160 --> 29:27.520]  Oh, this is gonna take us out.
[29:28.600 --> 29:29.840]  Okay, well that's
[29:29.840 --> 29:30.320]  a barrier.
[29:32.220 --> 29:32.900]  It's like playing
[29:33.660 --> 29:35.640]  Fallout 4 where you're just like walking along
[29:35.640 --> 29:37.480]  somewhere and it's like, oh, I wonder where this goes.
[29:37.540 --> 29:39.480]  And he goes, oh, you can't go this way. Oh, yeah.
[29:39.500 --> 29:41.200]  Is that right? Oh. No barrier?
[29:41.360 --> 29:43.560]  Just let me know. Just totally
[29:43.560 --> 29:45.540]  breaking the immersion? Oh, you can't go this way? Alright.
[29:45.640 --> 29:45.980]  Thanks, man.
[29:47.920 --> 29:49.600]  See that barrier over there? Yeah.
[29:49.700 --> 29:50.680]  You can walk to it.
[29:50.680 --> 29:51.980]  You can get to that barrier.
[29:55.720 --> 29:56.080]  Okay.
[29:59.370 --> 29:59.990]  Y'all watched
[29:59.990 --> 30:00.490]  Fallout, right?
[30:01.550 --> 30:03.250]  I only watched the first three episodes.
[30:03.390 --> 30:05.670]  You better get that point, dude, because you're gonna miss it.
[30:06.510 --> 30:08.090]  I don't know how to get up there
[30:08.090 --> 30:08.610]  is the problem.
[30:10.090 --> 30:11.930]  I don't remember if you got to a point
[30:11.930 --> 30:14.070]  where there's like an important lore
[30:14.070 --> 30:14.470]  thing.
[30:16.370 --> 30:18.050]  The next episode is them going to the
[30:18.050 --> 30:19.330]  supermarket and I haven't watched that one yet.
[30:19.810 --> 30:20.410]  Oh, okay.
[30:21.170 --> 30:22.570]  Then yeah, I won't ask you the question.
[30:23.230 --> 30:24.410]  Oh, I also don't care.
[30:25.190 --> 30:27.290]  Oh. I mean, you can
[30:27.290 --> 30:29.390]  ask. It doesn't matter. I played all the games and everything.
[30:29.830 --> 30:31.350]  The show doesn't do anything for me.
[30:31.370 --> 30:33.190]  It's just fine. Oh, it was more like
[30:33.710 --> 30:35.070]  something that happens that's
[30:35.970 --> 30:37.150]  well, after the games
[30:38.730 --> 30:39.410]  to one of the
[30:39.410 --> 30:39.790]  settlements.
[30:41.890 --> 30:43.330]  Oh, is it
[30:43.990 --> 30:45.350]  the thing that crosses over with New
[30:45.350 --> 30:47.170]  Vegas? Yeah.
[30:47.170 --> 30:49.150]  I just
[30:49.150 --> 30:51.250]  think that like the lore from the show
[30:51.250 --> 30:53.290]  and the lore from the games are just like
[30:53.290 --> 30:55.070]  not compatible.
[30:55.570 --> 30:57.130]  Yeah, they're just like not the same.
[30:57.270 --> 30:59.170]  Also, Fallout changes all
[30:59.170 --> 31:00.570]  the time with every new fucking game.
[31:00.790 --> 31:01.750]  That's a fair point.
[31:02.530 --> 31:05.170]  Every game adds another thing and a different thing
[31:05.170 --> 31:05.830]  and all this stuff.
[31:06.310 --> 31:08.710]  Are these the peppers? Is this the chili sauce?
[31:08.830 --> 31:09.150]  What's going on?
[31:09.490 --> 31:11.910]  I'm like, how is this not the chili sauce?
[31:11.910 --> 31:12.410]  Great.
[31:15.950 --> 31:17.970]  Those are the melons. We covered those.
[31:21.850 --> 31:23.070]  What about those?
[31:24.250 --> 31:25.450]  Yeah, spit on those.
[31:25.630 --> 31:25.910]  Oh!
[31:26.510 --> 31:28.410]  You would think, but no.
[31:29.350 --> 31:30.950]  Huh. Weird.
[31:32.010 --> 31:32.670]  That is weird.
[31:34.570 --> 31:35.310]  Can't even jump.
[31:35.450 --> 31:36.650]  I think you're not supposed to be on them.
[31:38.090 --> 31:39.190]  Yep, definitely not.
[31:39.730 --> 31:40.350]  That's funny.
[31:42.610 --> 31:43.790]  How do I get up high?
[31:45.650 --> 31:48.930]  God, this looks like it's gonna be a fucking headache too.
[31:49.510 --> 31:51.030]  You gotta climb that bomb.
[31:53.770 --> 31:55.110]  Hey, there's a bunch of chili sauce.
[31:55.930 --> 31:57.490]  Oh, it spilled down there.
[31:57.650 --> 31:58.630]  That's gotta be the chili sauce.
[31:58.930 --> 32:00.550]  Jump on the...
[32:01.050 --> 32:02.410]  Climb up the...
[32:03.810 --> 32:04.210]  Insane.
[32:05.070 --> 32:06.590]  Insane that that's what it is.
[32:06.990 --> 32:07.930]  That's it, really?
[32:10.350 --> 32:11.110]  Get real.
[32:13.530 --> 32:14.790]  Any other sneaky little
[32:14.790 --> 32:16.370]  coins back... Fuck off.
[32:16.910 --> 32:18.530]  Do you think the fish mouth might be that fish
[32:18.530 --> 32:20.250]  that was in the frozen section?
[32:20.310 --> 32:22.570]  Oh, you think so?
[32:22.690 --> 32:24.650]  Maybe. I don't remember if it's mouth
[32:24.650 --> 32:25.310]  was open or not.
[32:25.990 --> 32:26.690]  Did it look big?
[32:28.810 --> 32:30.270]  Bigger than a rat.
[32:31.790 --> 32:32.570]  Yeah, but we saw
[32:32.570 --> 32:34.170]  a key earlier that was bigger than a rat.
[32:34.850 --> 32:35.250]  Oh.
[32:35.790 --> 32:37.750]  That is true. Fair point.
[32:38.050 --> 32:39.610]  Rat scale, maybe not the best.
[32:40.970 --> 32:42.190]  You'll see it when you edit this.
[32:43.450 --> 32:43.710]  Oh, cool.
[32:49.130 --> 32:50.090]  Let's go up.
[32:51.550 --> 32:52.150]  At the very least,
[32:52.150 --> 32:54.270]  we should be able to find the fish from up above
[32:54.270 --> 32:55.090]  and get a good view.
[32:58.490 --> 32:59.490]  Can't go that way.
[33:01.910 --> 33:03.150]  Oh, this is going to be a nightmare.
[33:04.710 --> 33:05.510]  Oh, God.
[33:07.510 --> 33:09.450]  That's what I'm saying, dude. This is going to be tough.
[33:11.430 --> 33:13.530]  It's really hard to jump in and out of
[33:13.530 --> 33:14.970]  that when you're locked in.
[33:16.110 --> 33:16.730]  Let me try to get in.
[33:17.490 --> 33:18.790]  That was a mistake.
[33:20.990 --> 33:22.770]  Can I just stand on it?
[33:24.310 --> 33:24.930]  What do you mean?
[33:25.750 --> 33:26.010]  Nope.
[33:32.790 --> 33:33.230]  Uh...
[33:33.230 --> 33:35.470]  That's a no, so it has to be this one.
[33:35.710 --> 33:35.910]  Yeah.
[33:38.590 --> 33:40.810]  And then you gotta jump to the left on that thing.
[33:40.830 --> 33:42.990]  And then you go on that one.
[33:43.590 --> 33:45.230]  Oh, God! Oh, no!
[33:45.450 --> 33:46.150]  Oh, no!
[33:46.790 --> 33:49.330]  I was in the air. I'm going bullshit on that.
[33:50.410 --> 33:51.410]  That one's not on you.
[33:51.730 --> 33:52.490]  That's ridiculous.
[33:52.590 --> 33:55.110]  This game's fucking crazy. This is for, like, kids.
[33:55.530 --> 33:56.170]  This is for children.
[33:56.250 --> 33:57.730]  This is a kids game.
[33:58.190 --> 33:58.550]  Goddamn.
[33:59.410 --> 34:00.570]  That's not how electricity works, either.
[34:01.470 --> 34:02.750]  That's what you think. Oh, it isn't?
[34:03.530 --> 34:05.370]  I played Mario, too. That's how it works.
[34:05.670 --> 34:06.670]  We got Einstein over here.
[34:08.070 --> 34:09.350]  Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
[34:09.490 --> 34:10.230]  You got a kite, Nick?
[34:10.430 --> 34:12.770]  Yeah, Nick, go fly a kite.
[34:13.310 --> 34:14.450]  I got lots of keys, too.
[34:16.910 --> 34:18.130]  Any of them bigger than a rat?
[34:20.270 --> 34:21.330]  Not as such, no.
[34:21.330 --> 34:21.970]  No.
[34:24.970 --> 34:26.230]  Can't be trusted, then.
[34:27.630 --> 34:28.150]  Nope!
[34:29.330 --> 34:30.210]  Oh, my God.
[34:32.630 --> 34:33.150]  Okay.
[34:33.290 --> 34:33.850]  Lock it in.
[34:37.190 --> 34:38.590]  Now, what's crazy to think about is
[34:38.590 --> 34:39.710]  there's only one other level
[34:40.410 --> 34:41.330]  after this one.
[34:43.230 --> 34:44.310]  We're almost done.
[34:44.690 --> 34:45.210]  Is that right?
[34:46.210 --> 34:47.810]  Yeah, because there's five stages.
[34:48.450 --> 34:48.710]  Wow.
[34:48.710 --> 34:48.810]  Wow.
[34:50.070 --> 34:51.490]  Including the hub world, I think, right?
[34:51.750 --> 34:52.470]  Let's look at that again.
[34:56.070 --> 34:56.790]  City Market.
[34:57.550 --> 34:58.090]  Deserted Kitchen.
[34:58.210 --> 34:59.090]  Yeah, so we're in City Market.
[35:00.070 --> 35:01.050]  We got one other level.
[35:02.090 --> 35:02.630]  Deserted Kitchen.
[35:03.770 --> 35:06.450]  It's taking you six of these to get here.
[35:08.110 --> 35:09.130]  Geoff asked how many parts
[35:09.130 --> 35:10.610]  I think this will be, and I said ten.
[35:10.870 --> 35:11.650]  Ten's probably right.
[35:11.850 --> 35:12.370]  I think it's less.
[35:13.050 --> 35:14.130]  You think it's less?
[35:14.130 --> 35:15.130]  I think it's ten.
[35:15.330 --> 35:17.430]  The way you're jumping on these wires, I think it might be more.
[35:19.410 --> 35:20.230]  I'm locking it.
[35:20.270 --> 35:22.470]  Every missed jump is adding an additional
[35:22.470 --> 35:23.610]  potential video.
[35:23.610 --> 35:24.670]  It's additional parts, you know?
[35:29.050 --> 35:30.270]  He's got it, he's got it.
[35:30.410 --> 35:31.070]  Okay, never mind.
[35:31.870 --> 35:32.270]  Ah!
[35:35.330 --> 35:36.290]  I hate this.
[35:36.530 --> 35:37.830]  Tuck and roll, rat!
[35:39.910 --> 35:42.110]  Fish. Fish was over here, right?
[35:42.110 --> 35:42.790]  I think so.
[35:46.210 --> 35:47.470]  I can't get through there.
[35:48.270 --> 35:50.050]  Let's get back up on the thing.
[35:50.210 --> 35:51.310]  Oh, that looks like fish.
[35:51.930 --> 35:53.010]  Well, I think it is.
[35:53.050 --> 35:53.810]  It's the big fish.
[35:56.450 --> 35:58.010]  Can you hit his mouth open?
[35:59.090 --> 35:59.490]  No.
[36:01.110 --> 36:03.030]  But I feel like this is the right area.
[36:04.490 --> 36:05.610]  There are loads of fish.
[36:05.730 --> 36:06.850]  Are you supposed to get in his mouth?
[36:07.070 --> 36:07.810]  What was it again?
[36:08.670 --> 36:11.190]  I don't remember. I think you're right.
[36:11.190 --> 36:12.150]  I think I am.
[36:13.490 --> 36:14.810]  And they're solid.
[36:16.530 --> 36:16.930]  Oh!
[36:17.870 --> 36:18.390]  What a grab!
[36:23.510 --> 36:24.530]  Alright, loads of fish.
[36:24.650 --> 36:25.590]  Fish, fish, fish.
[36:25.670 --> 36:26.170]  Alright, shrimp.
[36:29.700 --> 36:31.520]  And now this is shrimp city.
[36:32.340 --> 36:33.360]  Let's turn back to the
[36:33.360 --> 36:34.480]  fish area.
[36:35.980 --> 36:37.780]  I bet it's over there, where the scale is.
[36:38.220 --> 36:39.740]  I didn't expect to get
[36:39.740 --> 36:40.820]  hungry playing this game.
[36:42.040 --> 36:42.920]  Oh shit!
[36:42.920 --> 36:43.760]  Little kid.
[36:44.860 --> 36:45.900]  What do you think you did?
[36:46.760 --> 36:48.720]  Grabbed you out of the air and snapped your little neck.
[36:50.740 --> 36:52.640]  It's the alternate ending of Ratatouille.
[36:53.240 --> 36:54.940]  That's just how the movie ends.
[36:55.240 --> 36:55.860]  It just goes...
[36:56.600 --> 36:59.020]  It's that edit of Toy Story
[36:59.020 --> 37:01.080]  or whatever where like they...
[37:01.660 --> 37:02.820]  People edit it where like
[37:02.820 --> 37:05.280]  they go into the furnace and then that's the end of the movie.
[37:07.420 --> 37:09.060]  Does that scene last
[37:09.060 --> 37:09.640]  forever?
[37:14.520 --> 37:15.100]  What's your
[37:15.100 --> 37:16.080]  kid's favorite movie, Nick?
[37:17.640 --> 37:18.560]  It was
[37:19.240 --> 37:19.740]  Cars.
[37:20.740 --> 37:22.920]  He has since moved on to...
[37:24.220 --> 37:24.900]  He's either
[37:24.900 --> 37:26.820]  on one of the Toy Stories.
[37:27.320 --> 37:28.540]  He likes the Lightyear movie.
[37:29.800 --> 37:31.360]  But he's really moved on to...
[37:31.360 --> 37:33.040]  I mean, I think that's really nice that somebody
[37:33.040 --> 37:33.820]  liked the Lightyear movie.
[37:34.140 --> 37:36.960]  Well, he doesn't know
[37:36.960 --> 37:37.540]  any better yet.
[37:38.080 --> 37:38.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[37:40.520 --> 37:41.040]  Do you
[37:41.040 --> 37:43.060]  remember the first movie you watched that was bad?
[37:43.520 --> 37:45.080]  I think about that all the time as a
[37:45.080 --> 37:46.380]  kid. Nothing was bad.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.940]  Everything was fine. Are you talking about when I
[37:48.940 --> 37:50.120]  was aware that it was bad?
[37:50.560 --> 37:52.980]  Yeah, like when it sunk in and you're like
[37:52.980 --> 37:54.000]  oh, this isn't good.
[37:56.060 --> 37:56.980]  No, because I
[37:56.980 --> 37:59.020]  like, you know, like every
[37:59.020 --> 38:00.840]  other kid in like the 90s or whatever. I like really
[38:00.840 --> 38:02.660]  shitty movies, so I don't know.
[38:04.660 --> 38:06.780]  I think when you watch
[38:06.780 --> 38:08.460]  Three Ninjas and stuff when you're a kid,
[38:08.520 --> 38:09.480]  you just have no idea.
[38:09.660 --> 38:12.340]  I really can't remember
[38:14.220 --> 38:14.960]  what was
[38:14.960 --> 38:16.700]  like the first bad movie. That's a tough one.
[38:17.140 --> 38:18.820]  Leave a comment down
[38:18.820 --> 38:20.800]  below. Let us know the first bad movie
[38:20.800 --> 38:22.560]  that you remember watching as a kid.
[38:23.160 --> 38:24.220]  That's engagement, baby.
[38:24.460 --> 38:25.860]  I think Gavin would say the Tuxedo.
[38:26.420 --> 38:26.820]  Probably.
[38:28.660 --> 38:29.500]  What year did that come out?
[38:29.500 --> 38:32.160]  Yeah, we would yell at him and say,
[38:32.260 --> 38:33.420]  no, we said bad movie.
[38:33.420 --> 38:35.480]  And then he would laugh and have fun.
[38:36.780 --> 38:37.620]  Dude, you mentioned
[38:37.620 --> 38:39.500]  Three Ninjas. Do you remember Surf Ninjas?
[38:40.260 --> 38:41.560]  Yeah, that's the one that I was
[38:41.560 --> 38:43.600]  thinking of originally and I couldn't remember if it was called
[38:43.600 --> 38:45.440]  Surf's High or Surf's Up or
[38:45.440 --> 38:47.540]  like it was Surf something and I went
[38:47.540 --> 38:48.160]  Ah, Three Ninjas.
[38:48.960 --> 38:51.520]  That movie might be one that
[38:51.520 --> 38:53.540]  I knew sucked, but I loved it anyway. You know what I mean?
[38:53.580 --> 38:55.620]  I loved it because that dude, the kid
[38:55.620 --> 38:57.040]  controlled everyone with the game gear.
[38:57.200 --> 38:59.600]  Game gear, yeah. That was the fucking coolest thing
[38:59.600 --> 39:01.820]  in the world. And Rob Schneider's
[39:01.820 --> 39:02.500]  in it. Yeah!
[39:03.480 --> 39:05.380]  And Leslie Neils is the bad guy?
[39:05.700 --> 39:07.680]  Yeah, but great. It's terrible.
[39:07.880 --> 39:08.680]  Like it's a bad movie.
[39:09.120 --> 39:11.700]  Do you even think it's 90 minutes?
[39:12.900 --> 39:13.860]  No, it's gotta be like
[39:13.860 --> 39:14.160]  70.
[39:15.460 --> 39:17.780]  The original Three Ninjas? No, no, no.
[39:17.900 --> 39:18.460]  Surf Ninjas.
[39:20.120 --> 39:22.020]  Yeah, from 1993.
[39:23.100 --> 39:23.680]  Surf Ninjas.
[39:23.880 --> 39:25.940]  Two boys learn from a mysterious warrior
[39:25.940 --> 39:27.680]  that they are the heirs
[39:27.680 --> 39:30.220]  of the throne of Padasan
[39:30.220 --> 39:32.160]  and set out to overthrow the current
[39:32.160 --> 39:34.220]  monarchy. And it is...
[39:37.480 --> 39:39.860]  It has a 5 out of 10 on IMDB.
[39:40.320 --> 39:41.500]  It might be too high.
[39:42.420 --> 39:44.400]  Rotten Tomatoes is 23%.
[39:44.400 --> 39:45.000]  Yeah.
[39:48.020 --> 39:49.940]  Wow, one hour, 27 minutes.
[39:50.720 --> 39:52.140]  Whoa! It's longer
[39:52.140 --> 39:54.200]  than I expected. Yeah, it's much longer than
[39:54.200 --> 39:55.760]  I expected. My poor dad.
[39:57.260 --> 39:57.740]  I know.
[39:57.740 --> 39:58.040]  I...
[39:59.860 --> 40:01.640]  I think about the things that are put on
[40:01.640 --> 40:02.940]  on repeat here, and I'm like,
[40:03.620 --> 40:05.340]  I did that to someone once. I mean, I was doing the same shit
[40:05.340 --> 40:07.240]  when I was a kid, you know what I mean? Right, exactly.
[40:07.580 --> 40:09.120]  That is just the circle of life.
[40:09.840 --> 40:11.720]  Isn't it? A child does not
[40:11.720 --> 40:13.280]  know if something sucks. They just know
[40:13.280 --> 40:15.580]  that it is lighting up and making noises at them
[40:15.580 --> 40:17.700]  the right way. Other way.
[40:18.180 --> 40:18.680]  Never mind.
[40:20.220 --> 40:22.040]  That was not the way to do that.
[40:23.680 --> 40:24.460]  What about over here?
[40:24.460 --> 40:26.520]  I'm curious to think
[40:26.520 --> 40:27.700]  about the first movie that sucked.
[40:29.060 --> 40:30.360]  Yeah, I have no idea
[40:30.360 --> 40:31.080]  what mine would have been.
[40:33.340 --> 40:34.500]  I remember the
[40:34.500 --> 40:36.640]  switch from full screen to widescreen
[40:36.640 --> 40:38.460]  and how crazy
[40:38.460 --> 40:40.320]  that was. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[40:40.460 --> 40:41.960]  I feel looking back, being like,
[40:43.040 --> 40:44.440]  the first widescreen
[40:44.440 --> 40:46.460]  movie I watched was The Count of Monte Cristo
[40:46.460 --> 40:47.440]  on DVD.
[40:48.080 --> 40:50.320]  And just being like, where's the picture?
[40:50.940 --> 40:52.460]  Why is half the picture gone?
[40:52.460 --> 40:53.920]  Andrew, you're not alone.
[40:54.120 --> 40:55.020]  I felt the same way.
[40:55.580 --> 40:57.760]  I remember watching The Matrix
[40:57.760 --> 41:00.100]  and it was widescreen or whatever
[41:00.100 --> 41:01.740]  and just going like, I don't like this.
[41:02.560 --> 41:04.380]  Why couldn't it fill up
[41:04.380 --> 41:06.400]  the whole screen? And I'm watching it on a 4.3
[41:06.400 --> 41:06.840]  TV.
[41:08.740 --> 41:09.400]  I'm dumb.
[41:10.100 --> 41:12.340]  Yeah, that made me mad too. I was like, why am I
[41:12.340 --> 41:14.040]  looking at these bars on the screen?
[41:14.240 --> 41:15.240]  Where's the rest of it?
[41:15.800 --> 41:17.080]  Where's the rest of the movie?
[41:18.020 --> 41:19.860]  Where's the settings to fix this?
[41:19.860 --> 41:21.820]  And then eventually learning
[41:21.820 --> 41:23.940]  this is wide. Why would I buy
[41:23.940 --> 41:25.600]  a wide? Why would I want this?
[41:25.940 --> 41:27.860]  Why are they selling this widescreen
[41:27.860 --> 41:28.560]  nonsense?
[41:28.980 --> 41:32.060]  I want to lose the left
[41:32.060 --> 41:32.940]  and the right side.
[41:33.700 --> 41:34.260]  Pan and scan.
[41:38.260 --> 41:39.920]  I'm ashamed to say how long
[41:39.920 --> 41:41.720]  I continued to purchase fullscreen
[41:42.280 --> 41:43.520]  as opposed to widescreen.
[41:45.120 --> 41:45.820]  I think
[41:45.820 --> 41:47.180]  the first movie I remember sucking
[41:47.840 --> 41:48.900]  wasn't a kids movie.
[41:49.520 --> 41:50.720]  But it was, do you remember
[41:53.420 --> 41:55.260]  Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson?
[41:55.940 --> 41:56.600]  Yes, yeah.
[41:56.800 --> 41:59.260]  My parents watched that and I guess I was
[41:59.260 --> 42:00.880]  in the room or something and I was like, this
[42:01.340 --> 42:01.740]  sucks.
[42:03.740 --> 42:05.240]  It is a... Conspiracy Theory
[42:05.240 --> 42:07.240]  with Mel Gibson. Yeah, it's a
[42:07.240 --> 42:09.240]  movie. I feel like that hits differently now.
[42:09.700 --> 42:09.920]  Yeah.
[42:11.880 --> 42:13.220]  What kind of conspiracy
[42:13.220 --> 42:14.300]  theories do you think he was into?
[42:14.300 --> 42:16.180]  Um, yeah.
[42:16.680 --> 42:17.980]  A taxi driver
[42:17.980 --> 42:20.400]  with a penchant for conspiracy
[42:20.400 --> 42:22.380]  theories becomes a target
[42:22.380 --> 42:24.360]  after one of these theories turns out
[42:24.360 --> 42:25.600]  to be true. Unfortunately,
[42:26.160 --> 42:28.400]  to save himself, he has to figure
[42:28.400 --> 42:30.120]  out which theory it is. That
[42:30.120 --> 42:30.760]  sucks.
[42:31.900 --> 42:33.660]  Alex Jones' wet dream.
[42:33.800 --> 42:36.360]  Yeah, but he's actually captured, I think, by somebody
[42:36.360 --> 42:37.920]  and held hostage at some point.
[42:38.120 --> 42:40.180]  Yeah, Alex Jones' wet dream. Yeah, exactly.
[42:40.520 --> 42:42.420]  You're gonna die to the rat man
[42:42.420 --> 42:44.260]  or whatever. You're dead. I know, it's insane.
[42:44.600 --> 42:45.080]  You're dead.
[42:45.300 --> 42:48.460]  I think I have to crawl into the hole. Maybe
[42:48.460 --> 42:49.540]  that's what the house is for?
[42:51.180 --> 42:52.440]  Um, by
[42:52.440 --> 42:54.420]  the time this comes out, we'll have already done these episodes, so
[42:54.420 --> 42:56.300]  it's fine. Nick, I think we're doing the Cheez-It pizza
[42:56.300 --> 42:57.220]  on Monday.
[42:58.500 --> 43:00.400]  I'm sorry, the Cheez-It crunch wrap and all
[43:00.400 --> 43:02.400]  that stuff from Taco Bell? That seems like a move,
[43:02.440 --> 43:04.380]  right? Yeah, all you had to say was Cheez-It
[43:04.380 --> 43:06.280]  and I'm in. Yeah, and then I just
[43:06.280 --> 43:08.380]  found out Panda Express is doing limited
[43:08.380 --> 43:10.160]  time hot orange chicken.
[43:11.680 --> 43:12.560]  Oh shit!
[43:13.020 --> 43:14.100]  It's available now
[43:14.100 --> 43:16.160]  through the end of June, and it feels like
[43:16.160 --> 43:18.020]  that should be the other one. Like, that sounds
[43:18.020 --> 43:19.780]  really good. That sounds great.
[43:20.140 --> 43:22.220]  That sounds really good. We always talk about
[43:22.220 --> 43:23.760]  how the best thing is the orange chicken, right?
[43:23.900 --> 43:26.120]  The orange chicken is definitely the best thing, but
[43:26.120 --> 43:28.260]  yeah, doing like hot, ooh, that sounds really good.
[43:28.580 --> 43:30.160]  Yeah! That feels like a good
[43:30.160 --> 43:32.240]  combo. That's like, that's such a move.
[43:32.460 --> 43:34.260]  Honestly, that's what they should
[43:34.260 --> 43:36.220]  be doing, is like
[43:36.680 --> 43:38.240]  just making some of their other
[43:38.240 --> 43:41.620]  dishes spicy. Agreed. That feels like a great
[43:41.620 --> 43:42.140]  move for them.
[43:43.380 --> 43:44.240]  I mean, that's sort of the
[43:44.240 --> 43:46.020]  standard for fast food right now. Yeah.
[43:46.580 --> 43:47.720]  Making everything spicy.
[43:48.300 --> 43:49.280]  Jimmy John's has that
[43:50.540 --> 43:52.200]  spicy wrap. Yeah, I just don't want
[43:52.200 --> 43:54.180]  to go back to Jimmy John's so soon. We just
[43:54.180 --> 43:56.200]  did it. That's true. Also, they're
[43:56.200 --> 43:57.820]  gonna hunt Cinnamon. Yeah.
[43:58.340 --> 44:00.100]  They're gonna kill Gracie's dog.
[44:00.480 --> 44:00.760]  Yeah.
[44:03.040 --> 44:03.760]  Wait a second.
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.920]  You're doing this now? I thought we were doing missions.
[44:05.920 --> 44:07.860]  I just said,
[44:07.900 --> 44:09.900]  I might as well do some of these
[44:09.900 --> 44:11.580]  so we can get these coins. Yeah, might as well.
[44:11.720 --> 44:14.160]  I just, I feel like I've kind of hit a wall
[44:14.160 --> 44:15.380]  with just running around. I get it.
[44:15.400 --> 44:18.220]  And these are very trackable.
[44:18.540 --> 44:20.080]  Like when we do menu stuff.
[44:20.920 --> 44:22.140]  Anything I'm missing?
[44:22.500 --> 44:23.260]  Nope. Oh, yeah.
[44:23.620 --> 44:25.900]  There you go. Glad I fell.
[44:26.220 --> 44:26.440]  Yep.
[44:27.960 --> 44:29.080]  Let's go back.
[44:29.900 --> 44:31.860]  There's also some new Buffalo Wild
[44:31.860 --> 44:33.980]  Wings flavors. Ooh!
[44:33.980 --> 44:36.180]  But those are always like
[44:36.180 --> 44:37.640]  so middling.
[44:38.060 --> 44:39.420]  For like an episode especially.
[44:41.000 --> 44:41.960]  It's enjoyable
[44:41.960 --> 44:42.940]  on the front end.
[44:43.660 --> 44:45.920]  Andrew gets all the good shit. It's all in Canada right now.
[44:46.040 --> 44:48.320]  It's fucked up. Yeah, what's up with that, man?
[44:48.360 --> 44:49.540]  It's because America's too big.
[44:50.360 --> 44:51.560]  But, Canada,
[44:52.420 --> 44:54.020]  notably small nation.
[44:54.220 --> 44:56.020]  Yeah, 100%. No, I mean
[44:56.020 --> 44:57.340]  comparably to America.
[44:57.840 --> 44:58.680]  For fast food?
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.300]  I feel like that's why they're less
[45:02.300 --> 45:03.160]  variety.
[45:03.460 --> 45:04.720]  Just like size.
[45:05.940 --> 45:07.080]  Jump on his head!
[45:07.840 --> 45:08.500]  That's it!
[45:09.780 --> 45:10.820]  That's gotta be the one.
[45:11.360 --> 45:13.320]  Nope. That was unrelated.
[45:13.640 --> 45:14.580]  What the fuck?
[45:15.600 --> 45:17.000]  Do you need to bring the...
[45:18.840 --> 45:20.520]  You gotta take it with you, dude.
[45:24.180 --> 45:26.300]  You gotta let him eat it.
[45:26.920 --> 45:27.680]  There you go.
[45:28.300 --> 45:29.640]  You gotta run, baby, run.
[45:29.640 --> 45:30.360]  Get the fish back.
[45:31.260 --> 45:33.720]  I had Wingstop
[45:33.720 --> 45:34.240]  recently.
[45:35.180 --> 45:37.420]  Dude, there's something about that place
[45:38.140 --> 45:39.400]  that it's delicious
[45:39.400 --> 45:41.700]  in the moment, but man, does your stomach
[45:41.700 --> 45:43.200]  hurt later. Good God.
[45:43.500 --> 45:45.660]  They do their very
[45:45.660 --> 45:47.480]  specific brand of wings.
[45:48.180 --> 45:48.720]  And it's really something.
[45:49.720 --> 45:50.600]  Pizza Hut
[45:51.280 --> 45:51.880]  wings?
[45:53.300 --> 45:54.680]  Yum brand wings?
[45:55.000 --> 45:55.960]  Does Pizza Hut have wings?
[45:56.720 --> 45:58.160]  Well, the Wingspot?
[45:58.500 --> 45:59.680]  Yeah, isn't that their brand?
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.240]  Oh no, that's Wing Street.
[46:02.460 --> 46:04.100]  That's like Wing Street
[46:04.100 --> 46:04.600]  or whatever.
[46:06.140 --> 46:08.020]  Wingstop is Rick
[46:09.120 --> 46:09.560]  Ross's
[46:09.560 --> 46:10.420]  wing thing.
[46:12.600 --> 46:14.060]  Really? Do they not have it in Canada?
[46:14.960 --> 46:16.060]  Not that, at least
[46:16.060 --> 46:17.380]  near me. Oh, that's interesting.
[46:19.120 --> 46:20.060]  My brother and I went
[46:20.060 --> 46:22.080]  to the Wingstop
[46:22.080 --> 46:24.040]  by our house in San Antonio so much as kids
[46:24.040 --> 46:25.060]  that they knew us by name.
[46:25.820 --> 46:26.700]  That's awesome.
[46:27.700 --> 46:29.340]  Anyway, my stomach can't take it anymore.
[46:30.400 --> 46:31.720]  At Wingstop Canada
[46:31.720 --> 46:32.640]  is a
[46:33.900 --> 46:35.140]  thing, so
[46:36.580 --> 46:37.900]  I'm not telling you to go to
[46:37.900 --> 46:39.020]  Wingstop. It's good.
[46:39.680 --> 46:41.940]  It's just sort of... it's fast food wings.
[46:42.240 --> 46:44.000]  You know? Yeah, their bone-in is better
[46:44.000 --> 46:45.580]  than their wingless. Or boneless.
[46:45.720 --> 46:47.920]  Wingless? Get the wingless.
[46:48.460 --> 46:49.380]  Yeah, get the wingless.
[46:50.040 --> 46:51.960]  Isn't that boneless? I mean, they're not really wing
[46:51.960 --> 46:52.460]  meat.
[46:54.100 --> 46:54.500]  Oh.
[46:57.520 --> 46:58.320]  I mean...
[46:58.320 --> 46:59.180]  Fuck off.
[47:00.180 --> 47:02.140]  Also, it's just easier to do it this way.
[47:02.200 --> 47:03.580]  I don't know why I wouldn't just...
[47:03.580 --> 47:05.600]  Yeah, right? I just looked up to...
[47:05.600 --> 47:07.520]  I'm like, I'm gonna check locations in Canada.
[47:07.660 --> 47:09.740]  So I searched Vancouver. And it's like, yeah, check it out.
[47:10.360 --> 47:11.620]  Here's two locations
[47:11.620 --> 47:12.400]  on
[47:14.360 --> 47:15.400]  Northeast 78th Street
[47:15.400 --> 47:17.260]  in Vancouver, Washington. Alright.
[47:17.940 --> 47:18.880]  Thank you. Great.
[47:19.360 --> 47:19.780]  Cool.
[47:21.460 --> 47:22.540]  Fantastic. Appreciate it.
[47:23.080 --> 47:25.160]  I need to pick... I put the pickles in the...
[47:25.160 --> 47:25.320]  Okay.
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.460]  We're almost halfway through the city market.
[47:30.620 --> 47:32.200]  Coins. It's awesome. Don't worry.
[47:32.240 --> 47:34.280]  When I search Canada, it shows me Canada, Kentucky.
[47:35.800 --> 47:36.480]  Oh, it's my
[47:36.480 --> 47:37.240]  favorite Canada.
[47:43.110 --> 47:44.090]  What the fuck?
[47:46.670 --> 47:48.210]  Parisian. Okay. Alright, Brian.
[47:48.330 --> 47:50.550]  Alright. Wingstop CA.
[47:50.550 --> 47:51.190]  Here we go.
[47:53.710 --> 47:54.690]  We're gonna find
[47:54.690 --> 47:55.710]  the closest one.
[47:58.730 --> 48:00.810]  So Rick Ross owns Wingstop?
[48:02.350 --> 48:04.110]  Or is he just, like, an ambassador?
[48:04.790 --> 48:05.490]  I'm sorry?
[48:06.630 --> 48:08.430]  Rick Ross, you said, was involved.
[48:08.570 --> 48:10.750]  Is he, like, a brand ambassador?
[48:11.190 --> 48:12.270]  Or... Oh, no. He's, like, an owner.
[48:13.250 --> 48:14.190]  I didn't know that.
[48:14.710 --> 48:14.930]  Yeah.
[48:16.750 --> 48:18.670]  Well, Andrew, unfortunately, it looks
[48:18.670 --> 48:19.990]  like they might all be in Toronto.
[48:21.650 --> 48:22.530]  That makes sense.
[48:22.590 --> 48:22.870]  Road trip.
[48:24.450 --> 48:25.250]  Fuck off.
[48:26.690 --> 48:27.090]  Oh!
[48:28.170 --> 48:29.910]  Okay, so that is what those are used for.
[48:30.730 --> 48:32.530]  I don't remember ever using that in the
[48:32.530 --> 48:33.890]  other stage. Whatever.
[48:36.130 --> 48:38.270]  So let me get this straight. You're on a ball,
[48:38.390 --> 48:39.230]  he can't see you?
[48:40.670 --> 48:41.870]  Yeah. I guess not.
[48:42.230 --> 48:44.550]  If a rat was on a ball, I'd never
[48:44.550 --> 48:46.150]  look at him. Not even.
[48:46.150 --> 48:47.150]  For a second.
[48:48.810 --> 48:52.150]  Oh, that was...
[48:53.150 --> 48:54.250]  I hate this kid.
[48:54.510 --> 48:56.470]  Fuck me up. You just went right to him.
[48:56.930 --> 48:57.750]  You wanted to give him a hug.
[48:57.850 --> 49:00.350]  I want to restart. I just want to go up here.
[49:00.810 --> 49:02.090]  Congratulations, you just did
[49:02.090 --> 49:04.370]  what I do on grouted run-throughs
[49:04.370 --> 49:05.630]  in Last of Us, when I'm like,
[49:05.710 --> 49:07.230]  I've wasted too many bullets, just kill me.
[49:08.850 --> 49:10.170]  Okay, so that brings that
[49:10.170 --> 49:11.110]  down for some reason.
[49:12.570 --> 49:12.930]  Classic.
[49:13.590 --> 49:14.550]  Yeah, normal.
[49:25.770 --> 49:27.170]  You got this.
[49:27.490 --> 49:28.470]  There you go, hit that switch.
[49:29.310 --> 49:30.230]  There you go.
[49:32.270 --> 49:33.570]  Everybody should be thanking
[49:33.570 --> 49:34.090]  you for that.
[49:35.210 --> 49:36.290]  Yeah, air conditioning.
[49:37.110 --> 49:37.830]  It's nice.
[49:39.430 --> 49:40.110]  It's nice.
[49:44.630 --> 49:46.050]  Oh, fuck, okay.
[49:46.870 --> 49:48.350]  Am I supposed to ride the fan?
[49:48.630 --> 49:49.250]  I think so.
[49:52.530 --> 49:54.430]  I mean, once again, this feels
[49:54.430 --> 49:56.530]  like a little difficult platforming for
[49:56.530 --> 49:58.670]  the audience that I assume this game is aimed at.
[50:00.850 --> 50:02.710]  Yeah, but do you remember how hard those
[50:02.710 --> 50:04.670]  old, like, Genesis
[50:04.670 --> 50:06.350]  and Super Nintendo games were?
[50:06.350 --> 50:08.110]  That were based off of, like, Disney games?
[50:08.370 --> 50:08.870]  I mean, movies.
[50:10.550 --> 50:10.990]  Aladdin.
[50:12.570 --> 50:13.450]  Lion King.
[50:19.120 --> 50:20.120]  Well, not that.
[50:26.750 --> 50:27.970]  I mean, it felt
[50:27.970 --> 50:30.110]  unnecessary, but I think this is what I'm
[50:30.110 --> 50:30.930]  supposed to do with that.
[50:33.450 --> 50:34.310]  Wow, okay.
[50:38.820 --> 50:39.760]  There you go.
[50:40.140 --> 50:41.700]  Wow, he looked right at you.
[50:41.700 --> 50:43.320]  Yeah, but he
[50:43.320 --> 50:45.780]  was thinking about a rat on a ball.
[50:45.840 --> 50:46.340]  You know what I mean?
[50:46.960 --> 50:47.740]  Get out of here.
[50:48.740 --> 50:49.960]  You gotta get through a hole.
[50:51.640 --> 50:52.720]  Hit it, hit it.
[50:53.280 --> 50:53.600]  Yes!
[50:55.700 --> 50:56.740]  Checkpoint, checkpoint.
[50:58.480 --> 50:58.800]  Yeah!
[50:59.600 --> 51:01.220]  Oh, wow, that worked out great.
[51:07.440 --> 51:07.900]  What the?
[51:08.840 --> 51:09.320]  Run!
[51:11.440 --> 51:12.580]  Oh my god.
[51:12.580 --> 51:13.240]  Okay.
[51:15.100 --> 51:16.440]  Hit some buttons
[51:16.440 --> 51:18.320]  to start the conveyor.
[51:21.420 --> 51:22.740]  Is that offensive?
[51:23.300 --> 51:24.580]  Yeah. I feel like that's the
[51:24.580 --> 51:26.480]  only culture you can get away with that with.
[51:27.260 --> 51:28.240]  Uh, the Brits?
[51:28.500 --> 51:29.620]  Oh, the French? Yeah, no, that's fine.
[51:30.400 --> 51:32.280]  I mean, like, is it offensive?
[51:32.460 --> 51:34.120]  Yes, but also, it's fine.
[51:35.100 --> 51:36.720]  Yeah, but you could also do it to the Brits
[51:36.720 --> 51:38.300]  or whatever. Yeah, absolutely.
[51:38.680 --> 51:39.020]  Yeah.
[51:51.380 --> 51:52.320]  It's like, he's here?
[51:53.320 --> 51:53.620]  Yeah.
[51:56.460 --> 51:57.540]  Run his channel.
[51:59.640 --> 52:00.800]  Can you go around to the left side
[52:00.800 --> 52:02.420]  over there to make sure you're not missing any coins?
[52:04.300 --> 52:05.020]  Uh, yeah, I can.
[52:05.320 --> 52:06.020]  I mean, like,
[52:06.020 --> 52:07.940]  just in case, did you check it?
[52:08.080 --> 52:10.140]  I don't. I'm not sure, I just
[52:10.140 --> 52:10.640]  want to make sure.
[52:12.180 --> 52:13.820]  I appreciate being thorough.
[52:14.380 --> 52:14.780]  Just in case.
[52:18.620 --> 52:19.980]  Still haven't become one
[52:19.980 --> 52:20.560]  with the fish.
[52:22.400 --> 52:23.480]  No, I'm still missing
[52:24.120 --> 52:25.040]  one fish.
[52:26.840 --> 52:28.040]  Do you have a favorite fish
[52:28.040 --> 52:28.500]  to eat?
[52:30.600 --> 52:31.600]  That's interesting.
[52:31.820 --> 52:33.020]  It's probably salmon, right?
[52:34.880 --> 52:35.300]  Salmon?
[52:38.990 --> 52:40.150]  Both of those are really good.
[52:40.390 --> 52:41.950]  They are. I like them.
[52:44.930 --> 52:45.490]  Once again.
[52:46.290 --> 52:48.390]  Yeah, go ahead and lower it. You're fine, you got it.
[52:49.650 --> 52:50.650]  Oh, shit.
[52:50.850 --> 52:51.050]  He missed.
[52:52.010 --> 52:53.450]  Oh my god. Oh, the kid.
[52:55.990 --> 52:56.830]  Holy shit!
[52:57.390 --> 52:58.650]  That scared the fuck out of me.
[53:00.870 --> 53:01.290]  Okay.
[53:01.290 --> 53:01.370]  Okay.
[53:02.950 --> 53:04.530]  Look at this motherfucker.
[53:05.090 --> 53:06.930]  Look at this midlife crisis
[53:06.930 --> 53:08.090]  having son of a bitch.
[53:11.070 --> 53:12.270]  Sunday comic.
[53:12.870 --> 53:14.570]  I might cut this from the episode.
[53:20.550 --> 53:22.150]  Just bleep the name.
[53:22.450 --> 53:25.930]  That's just for us.
[53:27.090 --> 53:28.530]  Oh, that was very funny.
[53:29.030 --> 53:30.310]  That was just for us.
[53:30.370 --> 53:30.930]  Good stuff.
[53:31.490 --> 53:32.690]  I got you, man.
[53:43.520 --> 53:45.600]  Get ready to tell the people, Eric.
[53:45.920 --> 53:47.280]  How to get this achievement.
[53:47.480 --> 53:47.860]  Get ready.
[54:00.360 --> 54:00.840]  Achievement!
[54:01.060 --> 54:03.380]  You're the switch hunter.
[54:03.380 --> 54:04.680]  We're the achievement hunters.
[54:04.720 --> 54:06.360]  And that's the way it goes, baby.
[54:08.660 --> 54:09.480]  And cut.
[54:12.900 --> 54:14.200]  It'll come in handy later.
[54:15.680 --> 54:17.500]  Let's knock out one more menu.
[54:17.700 --> 54:18.180]  I love it.
[54:18.340 --> 54:20.700]  I love it.
[54:23.340 --> 54:24.300]  Eric's favorite.
[54:25.360 --> 54:26.460]  He loves it.
[54:26.980 --> 54:28.920]  Look, I'm fine with this as long as we're...
[54:28.920 --> 54:31.480]  My problem with this is when it just keeps going.
[54:33.380 --> 54:35.280]  Like, when you edit Geoff's episode,
[54:35.520 --> 54:37.620]  just realize that it just keeps going.
[54:38.040 --> 54:39.340]  You're just, you're watching it,
[54:39.400 --> 54:41.080]  and you're going, Jesus Christ,
[54:41.220 --> 54:42.720]  it just keeps going.
[54:43.120 --> 54:44.080]  And it does.
[54:44.880 --> 54:45.920]  Boy, it does.
[54:55.620 --> 54:58.560]  Whoa, who the hell is this guy?
[55:00.160 --> 55:00.860]  Oh, that's Git?
[55:00.860 --> 55:03.000]  Okay, now, with your age,
[55:03.060 --> 55:04.640]  I don't think you're gonna remember this.
[55:04.760 --> 55:06.320]  Maybe, but there was a guy...
[55:06.320 --> 55:07.960]  Do you remember Body by Jake?
[55:08.520 --> 55:09.000]  Yes.
[55:09.780 --> 55:12.020]  That's Body by Jake, the voice of Git.
[55:12.400 --> 55:14.220]  We found out in the last episode, me and Geoff
[55:14.220 --> 55:15.240]  fuckin' flipped.
[55:15.660 --> 55:17.000]  Wait, it's actually him?
[55:17.500 --> 55:17.900]  Yes.
[55:18.360 --> 55:22.960]  Oh, everyone in this game is voiced by their actual, like,
[55:23.380 --> 55:23.580]  character.
[55:23.840 --> 55:26.880]  It's all the voice actors
[55:26.880 --> 55:28.000]  and everything. It's fuckin' crazy.
[55:28.460 --> 55:28.900]  Wow.
[55:29.780 --> 55:31.020]  It's pretty wild.
[55:31.620 --> 55:34.000]  Nice. Oh, good one. There you go.
[55:34.880 --> 55:36.080]  Oh, this is how you get up
[55:36.080 --> 55:36.480]  there.
[55:37.840 --> 55:38.940]  Oh, hell yeah.
[55:40.260 --> 55:40.900]  That was cool.
[55:41.980 --> 55:43.960]  Back at it, Git. Jump on, he's gonna
[55:43.960 --> 55:44.300]  move you.
[55:45.660 --> 55:46.300]  This rocks.
[55:49.000 --> 55:49.840]  Did you...
[55:49.840 --> 55:51.920]  Nick, did you like how we found
[55:51.920 --> 55:53.440]  the picture of all of us as rats?
[55:54.080 --> 55:55.060]  Yeah, that was...
[55:55.060 --> 55:56.860]  How did they know
[55:58.120 --> 55:58.760]  that, uh...
[55:59.160 --> 56:01.400]  That's exactly what I look like when I'm nervous.
[56:02.700 --> 56:03.160]  That was
[56:03.160 --> 56:05.180]  pretty good. I said, when I looked at it, I'm like,
[56:05.240 --> 56:07.100]  oh, that one's... that one's
[56:07.100 --> 56:09.380]  me. And then Geoff went, no, that one's
[56:09.380 --> 56:11.200]  Nick. And I went, oh, he's right.
[56:12.160 --> 56:12.480]  Yeah.
[56:13.120 --> 56:14.700]  Yeah, you nailed it. You nailed it.
[56:16.560 --> 56:17.020]  He's like,
[56:17.060 --> 56:19.040]  Eric, you're the one all the way on the right. And I went, that's
[56:19.040 --> 56:20.960]  true. And then it was very easy to see.
[56:21.280 --> 56:22.840]  It was very easy to see which one was Gavin.
[56:22.840 --> 56:24.660]  Like, it all just came together after that.
[56:26.040 --> 56:26.840]  Yeah, the Gavin
[56:26.840 --> 56:27.940]  one was my favorite one, I think.
[56:28.100 --> 56:31.000]  Gavin one's, like, on the money. But I do like...
[56:31.000 --> 56:32.460]  I do like Andrew.
[56:33.220 --> 56:34.720]  And I do... Geoff is, like, the
[56:34.720 --> 56:36.780]  devious monster guy. It's very funny.
[56:39.500 --> 56:40.440]  It was pretty good.
[56:40.440 --> 56:40.700]  Oh.
[56:44.120 --> 56:44.720]  Andrew, you're
[56:44.720 --> 56:46.820]  flying through this part. You're, like, a pro at this right now, dude.
[56:46.820 --> 56:47.460]  I'm killing it.
[56:49.900 --> 56:51.080]  I just gotta wait.
[56:51.080 --> 56:53.040]  I'm getting some more... I'm not scared
[56:53.040 --> 56:54.740]  of the lobsters. I'm just gonna stand here.
[56:55.560 --> 56:56.600]  You guys got it.
[56:56.980 --> 56:57.520]  Baby shit.
[56:58.800 --> 57:01.220]  I don't know why, but this feels very Gears of War
[57:01.220 --> 57:02.860]  to me. Him pushing
[57:02.860 --> 57:04.900]  me, standing behind this. I feel like
[57:04.900 --> 57:06.860]  I'm fighting Loki. Oh!
[57:07.120 --> 57:07.600]  Uh-oh.
[57:08.140 --> 57:10.920]  How's your Gears of War playthrough
[57:10.920 --> 57:11.240]  going?
[57:12.780 --> 57:13.820]  Gavin's been away.
[57:14.280 --> 57:16.660]  It's been dead.
[57:17.100 --> 57:18.360]  I'm excited to get back to it.
[57:22.100 --> 57:23.220]  We, uh...
[57:23.220 --> 57:25.300]  We had a glitch where the camera got stuck
[57:25.300 --> 57:27.060]  and Gavin had to keep going
[57:27.060 --> 57:28.620]  beyond where his camera would go.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.200]  And we're trying to guide
[57:31.200 --> 57:33.120]  him through it, and it was
[57:33.120 --> 57:35.220]  very funny to hear Geoff mentally
[57:35.220 --> 57:36.220]  give up and break.
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.100]  He realized that his left was Gavin's
[57:39.100 --> 57:40.860]  right, but he didn't do that correctly.
[57:41.460 --> 57:42.960]  Like, as soon as that occurred...
[57:42.960 --> 57:43.940]  Ups and downs!
[57:44.960 --> 57:45.340]  Yeah!
[57:48.400 --> 57:48.900]  Oh, shit.
[57:48.900 --> 57:50.520]  Oh, and a beautiful 300
[57:50.520 --> 57:52.040]  total charms collected.
[57:52.820 --> 57:55.120]  What a perfect spot to stop and save.
[57:55.480 --> 57:56.080]  Incredible.
[57:56.880 --> 57:58.120]  We're already at 59.
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.860]  This is a big level. I feel like we're really
[58:00.860 --> 58:03.120]  chopping it in. We're getting it
[58:03.120 --> 58:04.480]  down. I'm impressed.
[58:05.040 --> 58:05.600]  I'm impressed.
[58:07.160 --> 58:08.360]  Let's go...
[58:08.360 --> 58:09.160]  Let's quit the game.
[58:10.020 --> 58:11.440]  Let's watch some bonus content.
[58:12.860 --> 58:13.740]  Are you ready for bonus content?
[58:14.140 --> 58:15.480]  I'm loving it.
[58:15.480 --> 58:16.020]  Oh, yeah?
[58:18.040 --> 58:19.620]  You know what cheered me up today?
[58:19.880 --> 58:21.760]  I went to the Texas Surplus
[58:21.760 --> 58:23.280]  store, Nick, and I bought a new chair
[58:23.280 --> 58:24.300]  for $9.
[58:26.100 --> 58:27.540]  It's one of those crazy
[58:27.540 --> 58:28.980]  ergonomic chairs that you get
[58:29.560 --> 58:30.580]  working in an office.
[58:31.140 --> 58:33.280]  And I just found a little slide-out thing on the right
[58:33.280 --> 58:35.500]  that tells me all of the gadgets and what sits
[58:35.500 --> 58:36.920]  on the chair. It's like, oh,
[58:37.920 --> 58:39.520]  inflatable lumbar and all this stuff.
[58:39.640 --> 58:41.480]  Whatever. And then there's also a note that
[58:41.480 --> 58:43.040]  says Cube 122.
[58:43.040 --> 58:45.180]  So, whoever had this
[58:45.180 --> 58:47.520]  at their Cube 122...
[58:47.520 --> 58:48.260]  That's pretty funny.
[58:48.720 --> 58:50.780]  The poor dude in Cube 122.
[58:51.520 --> 58:52.540]  Oh, look at this!
[58:53.040 --> 58:54.820]  It's pretty cool.
[58:55.860 --> 58:56.860]  He's having lunch.
[58:57.000 --> 58:57.400]  Yum, yum, yum.
[58:58.600 --> 59:01.160]  No faces. Oh, look at that.
[59:01.280 --> 59:03.060]  This is like a crowd member
[59:03.060 --> 59:05.440]  in a sports game in 2004.
[59:05.940 --> 59:06.400]  Oh, boy.
[59:07.220 --> 59:09.320]  They just stand up and applaud and then sit back down.
[59:09.520 --> 59:11.260]  And then stand up and raise their fist and sit back down.
[59:11.260 --> 59:13.020]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:13.180 --> 59:15.380]  Market pathing diagram. So, this is
[59:15.380 --> 59:17.400]  in their head, this is what it was supposed
[59:17.400 --> 59:19.240]  to look like. Because it's like, oh, you
[59:19.240 --> 59:21.460]  go here to here to here. None of this
[59:21.460 --> 59:22.840]  made it to the game. Nope.
[59:23.520 --> 59:24.940]  And then, last one.
[59:24.960 --> 59:27.040]  Well, they tried. Oh, that's nice.
[59:27.320 --> 59:28.820]  None of these... This looks cool.
[59:29.120 --> 59:30.400]  None of these people made it in the game.
[59:31.340 --> 59:32.320]  No. Yeah.
[59:33.400 --> 59:34.880]  Okay. Damn it.
[59:35.140 --> 59:35.420]  Put the name again.
[59:38.160 --> 59:39.120]  Oh, he clapped.
[59:39.120 --> 59:39.400]  Ah.
[59:41.660 --> 59:43.360]  Well, Nick, that's the bonus content.
[59:43.580 --> 59:44.760]  That's Ratitude 6.
[59:44.760 --> 59:46.580]  We got some more bonus content.
[59:46.840 --> 59:48.400]  Bonus content from Andrew?
[59:48.900 --> 59:50.760]  I can't wait to see. More about when we finish
[59:50.760 --> 59:53.020]  1-800-MAGIC. We did. It's done.
[59:53.080 --> 59:54.740]  You can't watch it. Oh.
[59:54.740 --> 59:57.020]  It's over. What a shame that I
[59:57.020 --> 59:58.880]  still got to see all of it. Yeah, you missed it.
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.800]  I still saw it.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.160]  But thankfully, we have Crackle...
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.700]  No, I didn't. Oh, gosh.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.200]  Uh...
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.280]  Gonna go watch
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.520]  some Kevin Dillon movie on Crackle.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.560]  Oh, boy.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.020]  No, we're gonna do...
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.380]  You've talked about this, Eric. You have a fondness
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.380]  of the past for this. Uh-oh.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.320]  Okay. It's your favorite thing.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.500]  I don't remember. No idea what we're gonna watch.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.400]  Nick, it doesn't... I have no idea
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.180]  what he's talking about. I know you don't.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.100]  We are gonna watch Kinect
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.080]  Star Wars. Oh, my God.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.920]  What? Gurley
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.220]  Vader. What is this?
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.000]  I don't know.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.500]  We're gonna find out together.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.880]  Oh, boy.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.800]  I have a feeling this might get cut.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.040]  Yeah, depending on
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.460]  what happens.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.760]  Is this dubbed?
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:03.800]  I mean, that looks
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.640]  too on the money.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.580]  I've never
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.620]  seen Star Wars. Is this Star Wars?
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.660]  No. You've never seen Star Wars?
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.760]  I mean, it is Star Wars, yes, but...
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:22.420]  Oh, dear.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.960]  Rebecca Black?
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.200]  Yeah.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.820]  She's lit exactly the same as these other
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.780]  guys. Definitely not on a
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.220]  green screen.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.260]  Yeah. Well...
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.120]  Are they all printers?
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.440]  What are these buttons?
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.100]  They're their ranks.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:54.720]  Whatever.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.500]  Those are their ranks.
[01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.070]  Why did they make this?
[01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:08.990]  Is it like,
[01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:10.070]  oh, you take over?
[01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.650]  You're in Star Wars.
[01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:21.010]  Why is
[01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.890]  Ron Howard...
[01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.430]  Clint Howard is in this?
[01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:25.550]  Clint Howard, yeah.
[01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:31.070]  You know what's funny is I can't tell
[01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:32.890]  to what
[01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:34.650]  it's... Okay, never mind.
[01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.770]  I know now. What? That they're all...
[01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:39.070]  That this is all
[01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:39.710]  fake. Yeah.
[01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:44.030]  Well, there you go.
[01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:47.070]  I don't even remember being in this movie.
[01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:52.410]  We're getting into Spaceballs territory, man.
[01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.130]  Yeah. Wow.
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.990]  Well, guys, thanks so much for watching Ratatouille Part 6.
[01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:59.670]  Where you going?
[01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.430]  Oh, yeah, now we're talking!
[01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:04.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:05.170]  Now we're talking.
[01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:06.690]  Oh, shut up.
[01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:10.190]  Will my PS2 play Xbox games?
[01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.270]  Um, excuse me,
[01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:15.410]  I need to know if Halo...
[01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:18.730]  I'm sorry, I don't speak stupid.
[01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:21.690]  Wait, what are you...
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.810]  Surely they must have video game stores in the great land of stupidia
[01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:26.710]  where you'd be able to purchase and be ignorant
[01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:27.910]  because you work at GameStop.
[01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.930]  Dude, this is the most
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.010]  2006-ass fucking...
[01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.890]  I'm never shopping here again.
[01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:40.890]  Okay.
[01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:46.490]  That guy sounds like the
[01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.070]  angry toad from
[01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:48.990]  Pete the Cat.
[01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.390]  Yeah, check it out!
[01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:54.010]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:55.970]  Control-Alt-Delete, baby!
[01:03:57.730 --> 01:03:59.530]  I have zero memory of this.
[01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:01.850]  I don't remember there being
[01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.110]  a game, or is it just like a
[01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:05.630]  show? It's just like they're making a show?
[01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:08.130]  You don't remember the webcom... I guess you weren't, like,
[01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:09.970]  cognizant of, like,
[01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.250]  when webcomics were, like, a thing
[01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.270]  in, like, the early 2000s.
[01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:16.250]  I remember the Penny Arcade
[01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:18.070]  one. Yeah, but there were a bunch
[01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.190]  that were not Penny Arcade.
[01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:21.130]  I remember the Rooster Teeth one.
[01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:23.510]  There are
[01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:25.150]  so many that
[01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:27.410]  weren't. Oh my god, how long is this?
[01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.330]  Andrew, how long is it?
[01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:36.690]  Don't end it, please.
[01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.390]  Okay, that's alright.
[01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:40.590]  That I can live with.
[01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:45.310]  Uh-oh.
[01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:47.430]  What were we on?
[01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:52.550]  What were we on?
[01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:57.210]  I think, what other webcomics
[01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.110]  I read? I remember Control-Delete,
[01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.310]  Megatokyo was
[01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:02.210]  another one.
[01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:03.930]  Yeah, Megatokyo
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.510]  was another one.
[01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:14.730]  Was it...
[01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:19.790]  Megatokyo?
[01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:20.990]  Yeah.
[01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:29.230]  Oh, their
[01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:31.530]  RPG World was the one that I read all the time.
[01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:33.590]  And that guy went on to make, like,
[01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:35.450]  a bunch of cartoons and, like, TV shows that
[01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.110]  weren't that. He made, uh,
[01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:39.630]  OK KO and, like, Bravest Warriors
[01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.370]  and stuff. A bunch of, like, Steven Universe
[01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:42.890]  stuff. Okay.
[01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:44.930]  Ian James, uh, Qwerty.
[01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.090]  Ian Jones Qwerty was, uh,
[01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:49.010]  a guy that I was, like, really into.
[01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:51.210]  Oh, dude. You don't remember WebCon? I can't...
[01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:51.590]  It sucks.
[01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:53.290]  They're everything.
[01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:55.150]  To you.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:59.490]  Wait, what?
[01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:04.550]  What?
[01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.110]  I think this is Life is Strange.
[01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:11.990]  What?
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.300]  Sucker.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:22.740]  Got him, dude.
[01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:32.570]  Oh, he knew.
[01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:33.910]  He planned that.
[01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.690]  He planned getting tricked, so
[01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:38.870]  he crazy glued
[01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:40.430]  the...
[01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.750]  I say that
[01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:43.350]  all the time.
[01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:45.010]  God.
[01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:48.790]  What's the worst
[01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:50.750]  thing anyone's done to your circle strafe hand, Eric?
[01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:52.270]  You know,
[01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:54.890]  countless things have happened to it.
[01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:55.870]  It's just been too tough.
[01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.070]  This sucks.
[01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:06.510]  Maybe he should have just stayed as a comic.
[01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:08.890]  I don't... Hey,
[01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.970]  Nick, I will say, it probably shouldn't even have been a comic.
[01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:12.870]  Yeah, well...
[01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:14.110]  Ah, Prawn, my favorite.
[01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:18.650]  If they were real gamers, they'd have
[01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:20.750]  multiple consoles and multiple TVs
[01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:22.550]  and...
[01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:24.470]  Yeah, seems like a very casual move
[01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:26.170]  to me by these guys. No kidding.
[01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.610]  Do you think that they
[01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:30.690]  would affiliate themselves as underground players,
[01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:32.010]  Eric, on the Xbox ecosystem?
[01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:34.370]  I think these guys are full-spectrum warriors.
[01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:37.530]  Oh,
[01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:42.050]  girls like Halo? What?
[01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:44.370]  Wow. Crazy.
[01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:45.770]  That was funny.
[01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:47.490]  Thank you so much for watching
[01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:50.510]  Part 6.
[01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:52.930]  What a time.

[01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:56.210]  Thanks, man.

[01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:00.050]  I had a great time.
[01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:01.950]  I'm glad you had fun.

[01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:19.130]  Guys,
[01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.650]  if you know what other
[01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:23.010]  webcomics were really popular
[01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:25.510]  between 2004 and 2007...
[01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:27.650]  Oh, PvP!
[01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:29.610]  PvP comics
[01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:32.030]  was a big one. I think that was Scott Kurtz.
[01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:33.830]  Yeah, that was a big one.
[01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:35.270]  Watch that next time. I'm excited.
[01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:37.130]  You're going to hate it. It's going to be awesome.
[01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.410]  Let us know
[01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:40.610]  what other webcomics you watched.
[01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:43.110]  We'll see you next time on Ratatouille
[01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:44.650]  Achievement Hunter. Bye!
[01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:46.010]  Part 6! Bye!
