[00:00.000 --> 00:06.520]  Hello and welcome to another Doomsday Heist part 7. We haven't done this in a little bit.
[00:06.640 --> 00:10.340]  I don't even know where we left off. I'm running to check the board as we speak.
[00:10.920 --> 00:13.140]  I couldn't tell you what the last part of this involved.
[00:14.180 --> 00:17.980]  I know we're on the last one, but I think we have to do a few more prep.
[00:18.780 --> 00:24.140]  Oh, yeah, we got a lot of prep to do. The last one's that that whole like juggernaut fight, I think.
[00:25.040 --> 00:30.280]  We'll find out. But first, we have to do some recon. We'll find out.
[00:31.960 --> 00:33.040]  Series of recon?
[00:35.740 --> 00:36.540]  Series of recon.
[00:38.280 --> 00:41.120]  All right, let's go. We should like sync up, right? Where do we want to meet up?
[00:42.140 --> 00:49.720]  I think at the Pacific Allied Shipyard. Let's pile into a choppy. Sounds good. I'm on my way with a choppy. Sounds good.
[00:57.230 --> 01:00.530]  Okay. Oh, Nick's that one already. Damn. Yeah.
[01:03.490 --> 01:07.050]  I'm on my way. I'm headed to you, Nick. I'm headed to you, Nick.
[01:10.650 --> 01:13.850]  You wanna land? Yeah. Hell yeah.
[01:15.190 --> 01:19.290]  What was confusing? Well, he's he's flying at me in the- Oh! Okay.
[01:20.030 --> 01:23.970]  It's fine. You made it. I made it. I'm on my way.
[01:24.750 --> 01:26.670]  Not even close to you. I'm just going to the shipyard.
[01:26.950 --> 01:28.270]  You're so north.
[01:29.290 --> 01:33.850]  Yeah, we'll be there quick. Okay. We're flying over. Any skills? Sounds good.
[01:37.820 --> 01:42.140]  You and uh- Where's Gavin? I'm down here, Nick. Where is Gavin? On the ground.
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.540]  He's down here on the ground.
[01:47.020 --> 01:52.820]  I'll shoot a flare. Oh, he's far away. Oh, that's good. That's smart. Oh, he's so far. Follow the flares.
[01:53.480 --> 01:56.240]  Is he the one I'm looking straight at or is he more southeast?
[01:57.380 --> 01:59.020]  You're looking at him. Okay.
[02:00.780 --> 02:04.760]  Do you see the flare yet? Not yet. No, we gotta go over a mountain. You gotta keep shooting flares.
[02:04.940 --> 02:08.600]  You need something bigger than a flare, Gavin. You should probably pull up. The flare's not gonna work. Yeah, go.
[02:10.580 --> 02:11.380]  That's a good point.
[02:13.020 --> 02:13.620]  Bouncy bounce.
[02:14.920 --> 02:21.180]  Snowball launcher. Go over trees. Oh, that tree's low. Yeah, Nick, does your game still have snow in it or no? No, it's gone now.
[02:22.720 --> 02:25.760]  I think it's been gone for a video or two, but I can't remember. That's good.
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.940]  Oh, I earned some reward points.
[02:29.540 --> 02:29.900]  RP?
[02:32.300 --> 02:32.980]  Don't know.
[02:35.060 --> 02:40.200]  All right, Nick, do you see the flare? Um, I don't see it. Yeah. I'm looking.
[02:43.120 --> 02:45.560]  I heard explosion. What the hell was that? Do you see the flare?
[02:46.460 --> 02:48.000]  Uh, it was a bomb. Oh, yeah.
[02:48.040 --> 02:51.680]  Oh, I got run over. Ow!
[02:51.680 --> 03:00.540]  Oh, Jesus Christ. Go get him. I'm going down. Stop shooting at us. See the flare? Yeah.
[03:01.260 --> 03:01.740]  Stop!
[03:03.640 --> 03:05.060]  That was close.
[03:06.380 --> 03:13.300]  Hell yeah, what a landing. There you go. I wanted to stop that car by... are you in? All right. Yep. Let's go.
[03:14.580 --> 03:16.720]  I'm just in the middle. I'm just in the back.
[03:16.720 --> 03:17.040]  Oh,
[03:19.920 --> 03:20.320]  Wait.
[03:23.060 --> 03:25.640]  I like that Andrew could have had a much safer seat.
[03:26.740 --> 03:32.380]  I could have. Yeah, but you know what? Your right side is so clear right now. If you anything comes up on that right,
[03:33.300 --> 03:34.020]  they're in trouble.
[03:35.200 --> 03:40.200]  I think you'll be in trouble. No, we got guns. We got flares. We're great.
[03:41.020 --> 03:43.460]  They come on the left side though. We're fucked. We're in trouble, but
[03:44.100 --> 03:44.500]  right?
[03:45.080 --> 03:46.520]  We're fine. We're just taking a picture.
[03:47.240 --> 03:51.400]  Apparently, yeah. I'm already taking some photos. I got about four down, six to go.
[03:52.140 --> 03:53.860]  Imagine if someone's at the right side. I'd be like...
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.480]  Oh, yeah, you'd be... no, you wouldn't be... you wouldn't be like that, would you? And I'd be like...
[04:01.420 --> 04:06.800]  No, no, don't lie to the people. You guys wouldn't be like that. There's no way. Absolutely. Double barrel shotgun.
[04:08.180 --> 04:08.320]  What?
[04:09.300 --> 04:11.160]  Do you think we can take these photos from the chopper?
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.160]  Some of them are inside. I think they're indoors, unfortunately. Yeah, some of them are indoors.
[04:16.460 --> 04:17.520]  Okay, should we try?
[04:18.340 --> 04:21.820]  Touchdown? Let's go to my camera. You want to jump out? How do you want to handle it?
[04:21.980 --> 04:26.520]  Let's see if Andrew can do a drive-by picture. That's a good idea. I feel like I'm in the beginning of Dead Rising.
[04:26.540 --> 04:28.680]  If you go to the back, if you go to the water side,
[04:29.420 --> 04:32.160]  you have to take a picture of the water gate, so you could do that.
[04:33.960 --> 04:36.500]  So go to the back side of the building. There you go.
[04:37.500 --> 04:40.460]  That's Nixon's favorite gate. Yep, and then here, can you see?
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.060]  Like, you can see me.
[04:42.720 --> 04:46.060]  You think it's his favorite or his least favorite? Probably least favorite. He loves it.
[04:46.540 --> 04:48.500]  Uh, all right. Did you get a photo yet, Andrew?
[04:49.240 --> 04:51.300]  I'm taking photos. I'm not, uh...
[04:51.940 --> 04:52.760]  Yeah, it's close to it.
[04:53.560 --> 04:56.880]  You have to get closer. What? Nick, you're so far off. What are you doing?
[04:58.740 --> 05:04.380]  He's on the right. Yeah, like, what are you doing? Where are you going, Nick? Spinning around, spinning around. Nick, what are you doing?
[05:04.460 --> 05:05.580]  Here we go. Here we go.
[05:06.660 --> 05:10.420]  Got it. You get it? Yeah. And then you, did you send it to Lester? Sent it off.
[05:13.960 --> 05:14.440]  Oh, yeah!
[05:15.860 --> 05:21.460]  Oh, I gotta take another one? I guess there's multiple that we need. Use your phone to take a picture of the water gate.
[05:21.600 --> 05:25.400]  Uh, can you, you spin the other, oh, you know what? Nick, he's on the right.
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.760]  You're gonna accept that apparently, even though it looks like shit, but...
[05:28.220 --> 05:32.960]  Did you guys take a picture of the water gate yet or what? Wait, I took a photo of a seagull! Holy shit!
[05:33.280 --> 05:34.480]  Oh, that's cool. Save that.
[05:35.220 --> 05:40.000]  That can be for you. Uh, I fucked up my jetty photo.
[05:45.340 --> 05:47.240]  There we go. Oh my god!
[05:48.580 --> 05:50.400]  I've been hit with patriotism!
[05:52.580 --> 05:55.420]  Ow! Did you take the photo or not? Take the photo!
[05:56.300 --> 06:00.780]  I did! I did! Why are you repelling? I can't move! Ah, god damn it.
[06:00.780 --> 06:01.200]  Ah!
[06:06.220 --> 06:08.520]  Can I climb back up this freaking rope?
[06:09.260 --> 06:09.880]  Uh, okay, try.
[06:10.220 --> 06:18.080]  What if I, what's happened to me? I'm stuck. Oh god. I'm stuck in a weird wall. Here we go. We did it.
[06:18.900 --> 06:19.900]  There's two more.
[06:20.560 --> 06:20.900]  Uh-oh.
[06:21.620 --> 06:26.220]  Oh shit. Oh, oh shit. These guys are coming after us. Look out! Oh, there's the rope!
[06:27.300 --> 06:28.980]  Oh, it's going through the floor!
[06:31.480 --> 06:36.840]  What are you doing, Nick? Can you get the pictures in there or not? Did you take a picture or not? Take a picture, Andrew!
[06:37.320 --> 06:39.600]  Inside! Andrew, take the picture!
[06:40.240 --> 06:41.120]  Fly in there, Nick.
[06:41.880 --> 06:42.580]  It won't let me.
[06:43.600 --> 06:45.280]  Fly inside. I need better angles. Roger.
[06:45.820 --> 06:48.100]  This rope hanging from the helicopter.
[06:49.520 --> 06:52.460]  Uh. That's it, get in there. Okay.
[06:54.040 --> 06:59.520]  Eric. Yeah, what happened? You didn't even let me try to fly in. Why did you do that, Eric? What do you mean?
[06:59.520 --> 07:01.440]  We were supposed to take pictures.
[07:02.540 --> 07:05.800]  Oh, man. Why didn't you guys take any pictures? Got it.
[07:06.260 --> 07:08.040]  Yeah, all right. Way to go, Andrew.
[07:08.840 --> 07:10.900]  Well, you have to walk out of it now. Yeah.
[07:11.480 --> 07:12.980]  I got a motorcycle around here somewhere.
[07:13.760 --> 07:14.100]  Great.
[07:15.200 --> 07:17.880]  Yeah, let's all pile on. Let's all pile on.
[07:18.460 --> 07:25.320]  Take turns getting drugged through the dirt. Did you get it, Andrew? Yeah. Yeah, that was easy, guys. Way to go. Whoops. Whoa.
[07:26.300 --> 07:28.900]  Whoa, before we're detected, we crashed the helicopter in there.
[07:30.800 --> 07:35.240]  They're never going to see us coming, guys. They'll never expect us to come back. Yeah, let's get out of here.
[07:35.380 --> 07:36.780]  Let's get out of here, boys, just in case.
[07:38.160 --> 07:42.780]  Maybe they'll think that we're just the guys from the helicopter crash and not the guys that took the pictures. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:43.540 --> 07:46.660]  Man, a helicopter crashed here. Oh, these guys are back? What?
[07:47.300 --> 07:49.020]  They want to see where they did that?
[07:52.690 --> 07:53.490]  All right, come on, guys.
[07:56.330 --> 07:56.650]  Piling.
[07:56.650 --> 07:56.730]  Piling.
[08:00.440 --> 08:02.500]  Oh my god. Oh my god.
[08:05.840 --> 08:09.820]  Back to the bunker. Had to be done. Yeah.
[08:12.020 --> 08:18.480]  How are we still in the area? Well, somebody hit me. I mean, you turned around. It's on you.
[08:21.060 --> 08:26.020]  Can't be held accountable for my own action. What? It's true. It's true. That's Nick's motto.
[08:26.700 --> 08:27.120]  Okay.
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.340]  Well, in that instance, sure.
[08:30.420 --> 08:32.580]  Where are we going? This can't be right.
[08:33.260 --> 08:35.180]  No, you have to leave pretty far.
[08:35.920 --> 08:36.120]  Yeah.
[08:36.880 --> 08:39.340]  Well, Nick doesn't know what he's doing. So...
[08:39.340 --> 08:42.180]  Why are you following me then? Because I want to see where you're going.
[08:44.020 --> 08:48.680]  Nick, you seem to be more confused today than normal. Are you sure? It's the oxygen levels in this room.
[08:51.500 --> 08:52.460]  Are you sure?
[08:57.240 --> 08:58.600]  I mean, I feel great.
[08:59.720 --> 09:00.680]  Okay, good.
[09:01.800 --> 09:07.340]  Wait for your organization to leave the area. Yeah, just wait on Nick. Maybe it's the carbon monoxide.
[09:09.320 --> 09:14.060]  Did you get good sleep last night, Nick? I never get good sleep. Oh.
[09:15.680 --> 09:19.020]  So, no. Hey. Hey. Are we far away?
[09:20.880 --> 09:22.980]  Not enough. Keep going.
[09:22.980 --> 09:23.020]  Keep going.
[09:28.640 --> 09:28.960]  Excellent.
[09:33.920 --> 09:37.380]  Did you like that, Gavin? Yeah, that was great. I timed it perfectly.
[09:38.160 --> 09:41.780]  I like that you just swooped in and just made him crash into something else. Like it wasn't even...
[09:43.900 --> 09:47.960]  Yeah, it was all gravity at that point. Oh, get this guy in front of us. Yeah, absolutely.
[09:49.080 --> 09:50.580]  I'm gonna have a go on that. Oh my god.
[09:53.440 --> 09:56.020]  Oh, where'd the bike go? Where'd the bike go? Oh, it's over here.
[09:58.940 --> 10:02.900]  He went way further than the bike. Oh, money. I'm back.
[10:04.300 --> 10:07.500]  All right, are you ready for another prep mission? Yeah. Is that what we're doing? Yeah.
[10:08.420 --> 10:10.060]  Or just... we'll just hammer them all out.
[10:11.760 --> 10:15.380]  And then the heist. You guys will get a marker in a moment, and then we'll start doing the missions. Yeah.
[10:16.260 --> 10:17.480]  And then the heist.
[10:18.800 --> 10:20.600]  Let's do it all. Do it all today.
[10:23.100 --> 10:25.960]  We can do it. Oh, I believe in us.
[10:26.540 --> 10:30.980]  We got it, dude. This is it. One run. Should we put, uh, should we get a new...
[10:33.680 --> 10:39.940]  Sorry, yes. A new vehicle request. Game chopper. Yeah, I'm thinking one.
[10:42.200 --> 10:45.420]  Oh, Gavin! What's going on? We're getting shot.
[10:46.720 --> 10:47.780]  Oh, you're in a fight.
[10:48.440 --> 10:51.260]  Are you in a fight? Yeah, Nick's fighting some... The rat? Fighting?
[10:51.880 --> 10:58.340]  Not me. Oh, okay. It's popping off! Gavin, where's the chopper? Chopper's here. Let's go.
[10:58.680 --> 11:05.620]  Oh, it's around the corner. In the server room. Okay, that's good, right? We want to be there. Is it? Yep. Okay, here we go.
[11:10.440 --> 11:13.980]  All right, group up, squad. Get in this thing. Okay, coming to you.
[11:21.100 --> 11:22.720]  Uh-oh. Chernobog.
[11:25.420 --> 11:30.180]  Chernobog. I'm gonna wait for you guys because it's close to me. It was a good HBO show.
[11:31.920 --> 11:38.580]  There's a show called Chernobog? Nick, come to me. Where are you? Oh, okay. I'm here.
[11:43.090 --> 11:47.690]  I got run over by a truck. That'll happen. Let's see.
[11:48.830 --> 11:53.230]  Ow, I got run over by a car. Tell me if I'm getting closer. I'm getting shot at by a guy.
[11:56.190 --> 12:03.270]  Oh, God. Yeah, you're close. Oh, yeah? Yep. Oh, God. All right.
[12:04.890 --> 12:08.850]  All right, let's go, boys. Oh, rats.
[12:10.110 --> 12:14.430]  That was pretty cool. Yeah, thanks.
[12:15.330 --> 12:18.330]  Oops, getting pretty good at that. That's for you.
[12:20.670 --> 12:26.690]  You guys getting in a lot of fights today. It's been known to happen. Pick me up. Pick me up.
[12:28.330 --> 12:31.530]  Did you feel that rumble? Oh, Jesus.
[12:33.770 --> 12:40.430]  That was crazy. You hit me with your propeller. It's called a rotor.
[12:41.770 --> 12:44.110]  Oh, oh, I fucking hit my ribs.
[12:46.390 --> 12:55.230]  Hop in, son. Thank you. Oh, okay. On my screen, you wigged out. Oh, hello. Oh, tree.
[12:56.770 --> 13:00.110]  I think this is real music. Can someone turn the real music off?
[13:00.350 --> 13:02.590]  I don't have any music on. There's no music on.
[13:03.730 --> 13:05.350]  It's because you turned... Okay.
[13:09.330 --> 13:13.230]  I don't... Someone in the front. I can't control the radio back here.
[13:16.880 --> 13:20.820]  One of you fucks in the front. How are we going to control your radio?
[13:21.700 --> 13:26.540]  It's not mine. I'm in the back. It's not mine? Go turn off your music, fool.
[13:27.660 --> 13:30.540]  Oh, I got paid 10 grand for being an associate. Yeah, me too. I just got that.
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.300]  Unless this is... All right, where are we going? Is this... I don't know. Whatever.
[13:35.300 --> 13:37.580]  You could double tap Y to turn off the radio.
[13:41.620 --> 13:44.460]  I waited with bated breath on that one. I went like,
[13:44.500 --> 13:47.720]  that's just reasonable enough. And it's a thing that he needs.
[13:51.420 --> 13:52.220]  Satellite dish.
[13:55.060 --> 13:59.320]  That's good. Gavin, what else? This is like what it's like to drive around with Nick when we do
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.100]  100% eat. Nick just looks out the window and he says, oh, this. And then he just names things.
[14:04.100 --> 14:08.280]  Yeah, but I'm giving you the history. And then sometimes he says what they used to be.
[14:08.760 --> 14:14.260]  Yeah. It's like Anmo, but with just me. Does he have a context or does he just say what the
[14:14.260 --> 14:18.860]  old thing was? I mean, it's really there's sometimes there's context, but usually no.
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.500]  Like what place it used to be? Yeah. Do you ever think Elon Musk is a freaking
[14:24.500 --> 14:32.860]  moron for not calling it Skyfi? Yeah, but he changed the name of Twitter to X. He's an idiot.
[14:34.520 --> 14:40.000]  What? Fun. Whoa. Don't blow up the vehicle. Okay.
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.500]  Get some height. We can parachute down. Yeah. We're lucky. We don't need height.
[14:47.920 --> 14:51.340]  We weren't low enough. We weren't low enough.
[14:52.300 --> 14:56.020]  Did we get blown up? How do we get blown up?
[14:57.820 --> 15:03.380]  I didn't do it. Yeah, it was not me. I don't know, Eric. I jumped out.
[15:03.380 --> 15:05.460]  I jumped out. I died on a back.
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.660]  Oh, shit. Still got the flag gun out. That's a little suspicious. I had the...
[15:14.440 --> 15:18.900]  and he died. My brain went all over the door of the vehicle.
[15:20.360 --> 15:29.520]  Oh, we got to. Oh, hell yeah. Daddy wants in. No. Oh, get in, fool. I'm trying. It won't let me.
[15:30.340 --> 15:36.380]  Okay. Come on. Why wouldn't it? I guess there's just room for two. Yeah, that's... it won't let me in.
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.940]  Damn. All right, grab another vehicle. Run interference. That's sad for us, Gavin. Let's find something cool.
[15:41.560 --> 15:45.420]  Mark it down. What's cool? This. Oh, that's cool.
[15:48.860 --> 15:54.960]  Oh, my God. Can I get in this? God, this thing is unwieldy. I don't think this... I don't think it lets me in.
[15:55.120 --> 15:58.380]  You know, I think you're good. I think you got this. Oh, it doesn't? No, yeah, you can get in.
[15:58.720 --> 16:00.700]  I tried. I've been hitting the... I'm jamming on the button.
[16:07.500 --> 16:11.800]  Well, there we go. All right, let's go. Wait, what the hell? You're fine. Okay.
[16:13.240 --> 16:18.100]  It all worked out. Just keep going. It's fine. We'll reroute. We'll reroute. We'll reroute.
[16:18.140 --> 16:22.420]  See, I think there's only... I think there's only room for one. Uh-oh. I mean, I can see the... all right.
[16:22.660 --> 16:27.360]  You take that. No, no, you got it. You got it. Here, take this. Okay. Oh, nice, Nick.
[16:27.360 --> 16:35.860]  There we go. We're back on the road, Andrew. Oh, Nick. Oh, Andrew. Okay, Nick. Well... All right, Gavin, you lead the way.
[16:36.040 --> 16:41.620]  Well... I'll clean up the mess. Okay. No. Oh, Nick, you're making it worse. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
[16:41.740 --> 16:48.360]  I don't know if it is okay. What's going on? Guys, we might need a cargo bob. No, we got it. We got it.
[16:48.380 --> 16:54.920]  We got it. We got it. We might need a cargo bob. Why? Why do you need a cargo bob? Uh, no reason. Shush.
[16:56.020 --> 17:03.200]  Nothing happened. Have you seen Terminator 2? Yeah. Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh. We're in a canal. It's very narrow. Are you in a volcano?
[17:04.100 --> 17:12.820]  Yeah. Oh. Now the enemies are in, uh... Nick, this is... Oh, Nick, this is where you're supposed to be. That might be enough to get us out.
[17:13.700 --> 17:22.840]  Nick, you fool. Push me up. I'm shooting enemies. Why are you backing into me? No! Okay, well...
[17:22.840 --> 17:30.680]  Oh, shit. That was Eric. Just exploded Eric. That wasn't me. That was Gavin. That was my bad. I didn't see the name.
[17:30.940 --> 17:39.760]  All right, let's... No! All right, that might give us what we need. No. It's gonna give us the exact same as what we had.
[17:40.860 --> 17:46.160]  We've never gone beyond what we had, Nick. Oh, no. Okay, Andrew. What we need is a cargo bob.
[17:46.160 --> 17:52.980]  I'm gonna give you a shove. Oh, there you go! All the way up! You got it! Yeah, Nick! All right, let's go.
[17:53.980 --> 17:57.200]  God, finally. Nick, no! Nick! Oh, my God.
[17:58.820 --> 18:04.900]  What do you mean, man? Look! Look at this. This is some perfect... Hey. Oh, Gavin. Nice tank. Thanks.
[18:06.420 --> 18:11.720]  Oh, I don't think that was a bad... Oh, no! Just stay away from me. I think that was just a guy. Just stay on the left.
[18:12.580 --> 18:15.740]  You've got nothing but room on the left. Why? What is wrong with you, man?
[18:16.160 --> 18:21.560]  Oh, look. They're on the left. I do. I don't know. I'd rather you hit that than go into the little canal.
[18:22.660 --> 18:26.520]  Are you breathing in cat air or what? Like, what's wrong with you? Yeah, I might be.
[18:27.560 --> 18:28.080]  I don't know.
[18:29.260 --> 18:38.740]  Oh, it's so heavy. We're good. On a road. Did you see that? God.
[18:44.320 --> 18:46.340]  Pardon me. Oops.
[18:48.200 --> 18:52.780]  Did we lose tires? Why is this thing so milk? Oh, okay. It's so milk?
[18:53.380 --> 18:55.340]  So milky. Yeah, you lost tires.
[18:55.860 --> 18:58.500]  Oh, okay. How do tires make your game milky?
[19:04.360 --> 19:08.720]  It's a heavy liquid feeling. Oh. Yeah.
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.520]  Oh, there's a coyote. That's your fault. Oh, that guy lived. Good for him.
[19:19.010 --> 19:23.790]  Meanwhile, Gavin is golden eyeing his way through this area.
[19:25.850 --> 19:29.470]  That scene is pretty cool, though. The tank scene? Yeah.
[19:30.130 --> 19:35.210]  There's a bit where it hits a like a jeep like right before a river and the two men are just like in an explosion.
[19:37.310 --> 19:39.890]  Cool as shit. Hell yeah. Great stunt.
[19:44.990 --> 19:48.830]  I've spent so much more time playing the game than seeing the movie
[19:48.830 --> 19:52.610]  that I always think of the game version ahead of the movie version.
[19:54.550 --> 20:00.230]  But the only movie I think of an N64 graphics. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I get that.
[20:00.450 --> 20:03.370]  Oh, Eric, there's a helicopter here. I'm I'm on my way.
[20:05.230 --> 20:08.470]  You know what I support this fully make this current that was
[20:09.150 --> 20:11.510]  very satisfying. I'm like, I'm right behind you.
[20:12.010 --> 20:14.910]  Eric, I knocked my back off one of them. You should see if it still drives there.
[20:15.270 --> 20:16.710]  What do you mean off the back of what?
[20:17.130 --> 20:19.050]  The back of this helicopter next to me.
[20:21.150 --> 20:26.210]  Do you helicopter next to you? Do you mean this little green plane?
[20:29.150 --> 20:35.350]  I appreciate how dedicated you are. Oh, there is a helicopter. Exactly. Okay, here we go. Here we go.
[20:35.910 --> 20:38.470]  It won't it won't let me in. Oh, it won't let me in.
[20:41.870 --> 20:43.350]  You can. Okay, well.
[20:43.990 --> 20:48.230]  Oh, I could have cut the you could have just went right. But hey, you're you're focused. You're dedicated.
[20:48.510 --> 20:51.030]  But look at this. Are you focused and dedicated, Nick?
[20:51.650 --> 20:52.950]  Oh, dude, so dedicated.
[20:54.090 --> 20:55.890]  You committed to the path. Prep complete.
[20:56.770 --> 20:59.230]  Nice. Now I can activate the next one. Never got stuck once.
[20:59.730 --> 21:03.630]  Gavin, if I go all the way up and then I nosedive at you, do you think you can shoot me out of the sky?
[21:04.610 --> 21:06.070]  Yeah. Okay. Hang on.
[21:07.050 --> 21:09.470]  What if I go all the way up and I
[21:09.970 --> 21:14.790]  parachute down? Should I nosedive at you in the helicopter and you shoot me or I parachute down and you try to shoot me
[21:14.790 --> 21:17.050]  out of the air? I think you should dive out right as I shoot.
[21:17.950 --> 21:21.010]  Oh, that's actually a really good idea. Okay. All right.
[21:22.350 --> 21:25.070]  I'm up here. I'm gonna try a couple warning shots.
[21:26.350 --> 21:29.910]  Well, I can't look that far up. Oh, really? Okay, let me back up. So I have to shoot the last...
[21:31.070 --> 21:32.390]  Let me know when you can see me.
[21:33.330 --> 21:34.890]  Just kind of dictate where I'm going here.
[21:36.410 --> 21:38.610]  Can you see me? Mm-hmm.
[21:41.230 --> 21:43.210]  So if I'm here...
[21:43.210 --> 21:48.890]  Yeah, because I can shoot like right at you almost. Okay. Yeah, go for it. Okay.
[21:50.010 --> 21:51.190]  Heist crap, what the hell?
[21:52.970 --> 21:53.330]  Okay.
[21:54.690 --> 21:58.570]  Did I launch you? All right. All right. I'm coming for you. Damn. Here, try again. Try again.
[21:59.370 --> 22:05.590]  I gotta charge it. Okay, go for it. Okay. I'm trying. There we go. Okay. Okay, I'm coming in hot. Coming in hot. Coming in hot.
[22:08.470 --> 22:09.190]  Oh
[22:09.190 --> 22:09.970]  God, oh shit.
[22:11.910 --> 22:14.610]  Hey, hey, I survived that.
[22:16.390 --> 22:21.610]  How did I live? That was awesome. Can I be the helicopter guy?
[22:22.750 --> 22:24.490]  You want to fly? Yeah.
[22:25.830 --> 22:27.030]  Oh, you flying?
[22:28.210 --> 22:28.930]  Yeah.
[22:30.630 --> 22:33.170]  Wait, wait one second. Okay.
[22:34.810 --> 22:35.130]  Uh...
[22:35.130 --> 22:38.210]  I'm gonna make my way over to Gavin. Oh, here we go. You guys are all over here.
[22:39.330 --> 22:43.890]  You wouldn't let me call in my cargo, Bob. I was gonna hook up Gavin while we all stay. Oh, that's pretty cool.
[22:44.130 --> 22:46.230]  Oh, that would be cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[22:48.090 --> 22:49.610]  Ooh. Hello.
[22:51.570 --> 22:52.110]  Howdy, boys.
[22:58.860 --> 23:00.880]  Job done. Now I get to control the radio.
[23:02.520 --> 23:03.600]  All right, Eric, we're in.
[23:04.520 --> 23:08.180]  Wait, where's Gavin? Gavin, are you in? He's in. He's next to me. Yeah, we're good.
[23:09.740 --> 23:12.480]  Are you guys gonna like skydive out or what's the plan?
[23:13.420 --> 23:15.120]  What do we have to do? I don't know.
[23:15.820 --> 23:17.860]  Go to Heritage Way. And then what?
[23:18.400 --> 23:23.180]  We'll find out when we get to Heritage Way. All right, sweet. I guess we'll determine once we get to Heritage Way.
[23:23.780 --> 23:25.120]  Maybe we get another Chernobog.
[23:25.880 --> 23:27.260]  Oh, could be. Oh.
[23:28.780 --> 23:31.200]  Nagatomi Plaza. All right, here we are, boys.
[23:35.730 --> 23:36.110]  Okay.
[23:38.150 --> 23:42.930]  Follow him. Roger that. Going in hot.
[23:47.450 --> 23:48.390]  Where is this guy?
[23:51.820 --> 23:55.000]  Man, those flying lessons are coming in handy.
[23:55.480 --> 24:04.420]  No, no, no! I mean, you're flight certified. You're dive certified. Hey, Gavin died. Oh, hey, that happened. Oh, shit. Hit the building.
[24:05.620 --> 24:06.320]  That'd be sneaky.
[24:07.140 --> 24:11.580]  Hey, do you think this is inconspicuous? No, I don't think anyone will notice.
[24:11.820 --> 24:14.120]  Are you sure?
[24:16.800 --> 24:21.520]  Don't get detected. We should ask that lady if we can bum some cigarettes.
[24:23.840 --> 24:25.480]  Follow him to a quiet spot, guys.
[24:30.480 --> 24:32.240]  He's in an alley. That's pretty quiet.
[24:36.160 --> 24:40.240]  I mean, that's pretty quiet. Do you think he can hear that? Erik, what the hell are you doing? Do you think he can hear that?
[24:40.760 --> 24:43.100]  Uh, he doesn't appear to. I mean, I can. Oh, okay, cool.
[24:43.780 --> 24:46.560]  Can he hear the Rick James that I'm listening to on the radio?
[24:48.620 --> 24:52.040]  Give it to me, baby. That's exactly the song. Take him out. Yeah!
[24:53.460 --> 24:54.640]  Knock him out. Don't kill him.
[24:55.620 --> 24:56.520]  Take out the target.
[24:57.520 --> 25:00.740]  Don't let him see you. Got it. Steal the briefcase. All right, come back in, boys.
[25:01.380 --> 25:03.020]  Lay in the chopper. Oh, shit, Erik!
[25:03.020 --> 25:07.740]  We gotta go back. We gotta go back. The chopper's right here. Yeah, let's get in.
[25:08.440 --> 25:08.900]  Oh, shit.
[25:09.780 --> 25:11.300]  I'm on the ground. Jump in.
[25:12.060 --> 25:15.920]  I'm in. Oh, that did nothing. That's one. Nick, get in or we're leaving without you. I'm coming!
[25:16.580 --> 25:18.020]  Oh, I don't trust you. I'm in!
[25:18.740 --> 25:20.620]  I'm in! Turn the radio off!
[25:21.100 --> 25:21.880]  Oh my god!
[25:26.640 --> 25:28.560]  Turn the radio off!
[25:29.140 --> 25:35.060]  I can't hear you. The radio's too loud. There's nothing to cut to. We're all in here. Turn the radio off!
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.540]  God damn it. I'm drowning out with these bullets.
[25:41.400 --> 25:45.740]  I wish I could show this version of Erik to the last version of Erik. Oh my god.
[25:46.280 --> 25:48.140]  Oh, you mean the pre-GTA version of Erik?
[25:48.820 --> 25:54.940]  What's more insane is this is his company. This is our company. It was in his company before.
[25:56.320 --> 25:58.820]  Yeah, you should get more now. It's a good song.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.700]  Oh, I see. You mean the music. I get it. I get it. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't understand.
[26:08.360 --> 26:10.880]  Oh, haul out! I think I might need to go to the hospital.
[26:13.440 --> 26:16.700]  There's something wrong with Nick. Oh, classic.
[26:20.260 --> 26:21.220]  Also, oh.
[26:21.900 --> 26:23.300]  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
[26:23.700 --> 26:29.140]  It's pretty smooth. No, it's not. Well, while you guys were getting in, we were getting beat up pretty good.
[26:29.200 --> 26:31.260]  And then someone was firing fireworks at it.
[26:31.780 --> 26:32.260]  Oh, okay.
[26:33.100 --> 26:33.460]  Who?
[26:36.020 --> 26:41.240]  Got you, I assume? I don't know. No, I fired fireworks at other stuff. Okay, so it was you.
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.980]  No, I hit the cars.
[26:44.400 --> 26:44.840]  No!
[26:46.180 --> 26:51.660]  I didn't go up. I went straight. Crazy. Insane. What do you mean? What a maniac.
[26:51.980 --> 26:57.000]  What do you mean? Who was firing fireworks? I was firing fireworks, but it couldn't have been me.
[26:58.120 --> 27:04.280]  Is it me? Who has the briefcase? No. Not finally. I can listen to the fucking radio again.
[27:05.620 --> 27:11.660]  Hey, if you're watching this just on Patreon.
[27:12.760 --> 27:16.620]  Nah, the editor can like re-record some of this or whatever, you know, it's fine.
[27:17.160 --> 27:21.080]  Oh, you just, as an audio person, that just pissed me off so bad.
[27:22.480 --> 27:22.880]  Oh!
[27:31.620 --> 27:34.980]  How we do, Andrew? I'm waiting for him to deliver it.
[27:35.840 --> 27:42.420]  Who's got it? Gavin. Probably Gavin. What the hell's taking so long, Gavin? He's just standing still. Oh, I do have it? Yes.
[27:42.660 --> 27:43.620]  Oh shit.
[27:44.340 --> 27:46.760]  What I'm doing up here is just for, this is just for the editor,
[27:46.760 --> 27:49.120]  but this is really cool. With this song, this rocks.
[27:51.180 --> 27:53.780]  How did I get the briefcase? You always had it.
[27:54.140 --> 27:58.900]  Oh, I thought... You ran, you shot the guy to death and ran up to him. No, I just kicked him. Maybe that's how I shot him.
[28:00.220 --> 28:01.680]  You know how close you have to be to kick someone?
[28:02.400 --> 28:05.300]  Yeah, I just... Someone already had it. He's got you there.
[28:06.700 --> 28:07.940]  All right, let me get the hell out of here.
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.260]  Getting ready to initiate the next mission. Let's do it. I still have this helicopter.
[28:14.200 --> 28:18.600]  I can't believe we still got it. I've been listening. I've been hanging out listening to the radio up here, baby.
[28:20.360 --> 28:23.040]  Wait, there's another helicopter. No. That must be Nick.
[28:24.280 --> 28:25.920]  That must be my enemy. Ah, shit.
[28:27.820 --> 28:28.780]  Well, who are you gonna pick?
[28:30.140 --> 28:33.920]  Oh, hey, Gavin's here. Hey. Did you get sucked back in, Gavin? Yeah.
[28:35.120 --> 28:37.940]  I don't know if Andrew sucked me in or if I just stumbled into the thing.
[28:38.980 --> 28:43.820]  I sucked you in hoping you would suck everybody in to get Eric out of the flying seat.
[28:46.060 --> 28:48.260]  I have no weapons. Just me!
[28:49.840 --> 28:52.400]  There can be only one.
[28:58.240 --> 29:00.540]  I'm Angus McCloud or whatever his name is.
[29:01.780 --> 29:04.440]  Was Angus McCloud, uh...
[29:04.440 --> 29:06.260]  Isn't that the guy from...
[29:06.860 --> 29:07.140]  Highlander?
[29:08.540 --> 29:12.100]  There can be only one. Oh, I thought you were talking about like a flying thing.
[29:14.080 --> 29:19.620]  You... Fox McCloud? Yeah, that's what I thought you were talking about. I thought you're trying to make a Star Fox reference. Oh, no.
[29:20.780 --> 29:25.720]  I went off of your reference. Yeah, no, I thought you were going with Star Fox.
[29:27.300 --> 29:28.260]  How'd that work out for you, bud?
[29:31.340 --> 29:35.540]  How you doing over there, Gavin? Pretty good. Can I get in? Oh, absolutely. You want to listen to the radio?
[29:37.400 --> 29:37.800]  Sure...
[29:37.800 --> 29:38.480]  Brent.
[29:39.800 --> 29:41.920]  Uh, let's see. Oh, this is actually a really good song.
[29:43.820 --> 29:47.360]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come on, Nick, come on!
[29:48.700 --> 29:52.200]  Nick, come on. Nick, get in! MOLOTOV!
[30:00.400 --> 30:08.960]  There we go. Better than a flare. Get in! Land, you son of a bitch!
[30:10.720 --> 30:13.070]  We're gonna be causing quite a large fire here.
[30:28.460 --> 30:30.300]  Can we all throw molotovs out the side?
[30:31.800 --> 30:34.420]  Boys, I don't know if this has got the legs for it.
[30:35.380 --> 30:36.980]  Just get as many legs as you can from it.
[30:40.980 --> 30:41.380]  Procopio.
[30:42.660 --> 30:44.820]  Knowing our luck, it'll run out right as we hit the lake.
[30:46.420 --> 30:48.560]  Damn it. God damn it.
[30:50.480 --> 30:53.760]  God damn it. I'm just gonna turn my music all the way down.
[30:56.400 --> 30:58.640]  There you go, you can cut to my footage now.
[30:59.780 --> 31:00.160]  Uh oh.
[31:01.700 --> 31:02.780]  Eric, is that you?
[31:02.880 --> 31:03.140]  Nope!
[31:03.320 --> 31:04.000]  Or the chopper?
[31:04.160 --> 31:04.420]  Yep!
[31:04.700 --> 31:06.720]  I think a lot of footage is about to be pretty similar.
[31:06.720 --> 31:11.160]  I'm turning it off from the back because you won't let me reach to the front!
[31:11.800 --> 31:13.760]  I'm taking us out with EMPs!
[31:19.820 --> 31:21.700]  We built this channel!
[31:22.880 --> 31:26.720]  We built this channel on content strikes!
[31:30.260 --> 31:34.740]  Oh man, this might be the slowest way to go to Procopio Drive.
[31:36.720 --> 31:40.380]  The funny thing is we've come too far to go back to the other side.
[31:40.620 --> 31:42.060]  We're in the frickin' middle.
[31:43.780 --> 31:46.040]  Andrew, why did you do that?
[31:46.240 --> 31:48.040]  Because I can't control the radio!
[31:48.560 --> 31:51.020]  We were almost there, the song was good!
[31:51.140 --> 31:51.920]  I had to!
[31:54.080 --> 31:55.720]  I watched that live once.
[31:56.880 --> 31:57.180]  Oh really?
[31:57.500 --> 31:57.780]  Yeah.
[31:58.840 --> 31:59.500]  What? Where?
[32:01.540 --> 32:02.060]  Uh...
[32:02.840 --> 32:04.780]  The streamies? I think.
[32:05.280 --> 32:05.800]  What?!
[32:05.800 --> 32:10.540]  They were just, uh, giving out awards and then it was like, oh here's Starship.
[32:11.340 --> 32:12.800]  What the fuck?!
[32:15.860 --> 32:17.120]  Ooh, a boat! Cool!
[32:17.680 --> 32:19.080]  Yeah, I'm on my way to it, baby!
[32:20.240 --> 32:21.320]  You guys wanna pick up?
[32:21.820 --> 32:24.040]  You're on your way to the- oh, there's two boats.
[32:26.700 --> 32:28.920]  Well, let me know because I can pick you up in my boat.
[32:29.800 --> 32:30.880]  The better boat.
[32:32.080 --> 32:33.500]  Oh, you got one of the better boats?
[32:33.720 --> 32:33.980]  Yeah.
[32:34.340 --> 32:34.860]  Oh shit.
[32:34.860 --> 32:37.180]  Nick's fucking piddly little boat.
[32:38.020 --> 32:39.860]  Nah, your pissant boat couldn't...
[32:40.920 --> 32:41.720]  Gettin' piddly.
[32:42.000 --> 32:42.880]  Alright, I got a chopper.
[32:43.460 --> 32:45.980]  Oh, that's great! Come pick up me and Nick, we're next to each other by our boats.
[32:46.480 --> 32:46.840]  Alright.
[32:46.960 --> 32:47.840]  There's pigs here!
[32:47.960 --> 32:49.120]  Oh, come get the pigs!
[32:50.060 --> 32:51.280]  Guys, come get the pigs!
[32:51.620 --> 32:52.780]  Like pigs or police?
[32:53.460 --> 32:55.120]  Oh no, there's actual pigs. It's real pigs.
[32:55.220 --> 32:56.560]  I'm gonna sneak up on it.
[32:57.560 --> 32:58.600]  I wouldn't do that one.
[32:58.840 --> 32:59.520]  Can you kick a pig?
[33:00.460 --> 33:02.540]  Oh, dude, blood came out of its ass.
[33:02.540 --> 33:04.120]  Nom nom nom nom.
[33:04.360 --> 33:05.480]  That was pretty brutal.
[33:06.620 --> 33:07.320]  Where's the other one?
[33:07.680 --> 33:08.120]  I don't know.
[33:08.460 --> 33:09.920]  You said there was pigs. I only saw pig.
[33:10.660 --> 33:11.760]  Andrew tried to taze me.
[33:12.580 --> 33:15.420]  Yeah, I did. I tried to get into the violent scene I missed.
[33:15.880 --> 33:17.460]  Oh, come get me and Nick. We're down here.
[33:17.740 --> 33:18.580]  There's plenty of room to land.
[33:19.080 --> 33:20.400]  I don't think you can taze your own organization.
[33:21.000 --> 33:21.660]  We're down here.
[33:21.660 --> 33:23.280]  I don't think you can, probably not, but I wanted to try.
[33:23.800 --> 33:24.160]  America!
[33:25.360 --> 33:25.800]  Oh, stop.
[33:35.420 --> 33:38.600]  Oh, is this how this feels?
[33:40.680 --> 33:42.060]  All right, get the damn in.
[33:42.480 --> 33:43.940]  This time, radio free.
[33:44.100 --> 33:45.600]  Hey, that boat's moving on its own!
[33:46.100 --> 33:46.480]  This one?
[33:46.960 --> 33:47.280]  Yeah.
[33:47.560 --> 33:47.740]  Yeah.
[33:48.380 --> 33:49.780]  Or is the wind from your chopper making it move?
[33:49.780 --> 33:50.900]  Not Desmond's boat!
[33:51.220 --> 33:52.020]  Desmond da boat!
[33:52.020 --> 33:52.820]  Penny!
[33:53.720 --> 33:55.860]  I've never stopped loving you!
[33:57.580 --> 33:58.060]  Oh!
[33:58.680 --> 33:59.680]  Nah, it's not my boat.
[33:59.760 --> 34:00.900]  It didn't stop sailing!
[34:01.860 --> 34:04.960]  No matter what I do, you're gonna die, Charlie!
[34:08.380 --> 34:09.840]  Oh, what does his hand say?
[34:09.920 --> 34:10.640]  Oh, it's all smothered.
[34:10.680 --> 34:11.340]  Can't read it.
[34:12.800 --> 34:13.760]  Not something.
[34:14.640 --> 34:16.880]  That was a pretty good pen that he found.
[34:17.280 --> 34:17.740]  Yeah, really.
[34:17.780 --> 34:18.300]  Yeah, right?
[34:20.220 --> 34:21.400]  Did you turn on the radio?
[34:23.240 --> 34:23.540]  What?
[34:24.720 --> 34:25.320]  What?
[34:28.500 --> 34:29.100]  Uh...
[34:30.040 --> 34:31.480]  Are we all okay?
[34:34.700 --> 34:36.420]  What's on Los Santos Rock Radio?
[34:37.160 --> 34:38.520]  Oh, you...
[34:38.520 --> 34:39.960]  I can't control it!
[34:40.540 --> 34:41.300]  Stop asking!
[34:43.120 --> 34:43.700]  Still starship.
[34:44.360 --> 34:47.240]  Is this what it's like when I'm behind you at a restaurant and I say,
[34:48.980 --> 34:50.540]  There's no Pecos Pete here!
[34:51.780 --> 34:53.120]  There's no Pecos Pete there!
[34:53.780 --> 34:54.260]  Texas Pete.
[34:54.820 --> 34:55.620]  Bring us down!
[34:56.060 --> 34:56.680]  Bring us down!
[34:57.260 --> 34:58.100]  Bringing us down!
[34:59.440 --> 35:00.180]  Bringing us down!
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.440]  Oh my god!
[35:02.780 --> 35:04.120]  That looked brutal on my screen.
[35:05.840 --> 35:06.280]  Shortcut!
[35:06.960 --> 35:07.780]  Activating shortcut.
[35:09.820 --> 35:10.520]  Activating... shortcut.
[35:13.800 --> 35:15.000]  We gotta beat him for it to be a shortcut!
[35:15.320 --> 35:15.760]  We gotta beat him!
[35:15.940 --> 35:18.460]  No no no no no no no no no no no no no no!
[35:18.460 --> 35:19.520]  No no no no no!
[35:20.780 --> 35:21.900]  Oh god!
[35:25.280 --> 35:28.660]  You hit me with so many chopper blades first.
[35:28.800 --> 35:29.720]  Oh my god.
[35:30.020 --> 35:32.300]  Oh god, it's not a friendly place!
[35:34.200 --> 35:36.460]  These guys don't want us here.
[35:39.360 --> 35:41.080]  Why won't Lester tell us we're here?
[35:41.540 --> 35:42.760]  Carelessly drop in.
[35:44.320 --> 35:46.000]  What are we supposed to do? Enter the house?
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.760]  Don't forget the weapon wheel!
[35:48.100 --> 35:49.900]  There we go. I'm in!
[35:50.440 --> 35:51.840]  I'm gonna have to take to the skies.
[35:51.980 --> 35:52.820]  Oh shit!
[35:53.880 --> 35:55.180]  Do it. Take to the skies.
[35:55.880 --> 35:57.000]  I'm gonna hide in the sky.
[36:01.300 --> 36:02.160]  Watch your six!
[36:04.540 --> 36:06.080]  Me and Andrew are clearing this.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.620]  This guy's still alive in the kitchen!
[36:10.480 --> 36:11.760]  Hey, you think this coffee's fresh?
[36:13.060 --> 36:13.540]  Smoke's out!
[36:15.980 --> 36:16.660]  Smoke's out!
[36:16.660 --> 36:19.120]  They have a coffee pot. I see coffee in there.
[36:19.520 --> 36:20.300]  Smoke's out!
[36:20.680 --> 36:21.860]  Oh, I shot it. Nevermind.
[36:22.660 --> 36:23.900]  We gotta go! Go go go!
[36:24.480 --> 36:25.140]  Smoke out!
[36:25.360 --> 36:25.960]  Smoke out!
[36:27.480 --> 36:28.780]  This isn't Call of Duty!
[36:32.940 --> 36:34.020]  We gotta get out of here!
[36:34.860 --> 36:35.700]  Come on! Alright!
[36:35.940 --> 36:37.200]  Land, Gavin! Let's go!
[36:37.720 --> 36:38.740]  I'll drive us to Gavin!
[36:40.460 --> 36:41.400]  Gavin, come on down!
[36:42.380 --> 36:43.980]  I see you! Land! Land now!
[36:45.340 --> 36:46.380]  Land it now!
[36:47.800 --> 36:49.360]  Get the diamond!
[36:53.640 --> 36:55.180]  Gavin exploded you!
[36:55.300 --> 36:55.620]  Got it!
[36:56.280 --> 36:58.820]  Did someone run in front of the missile launcher?
[36:59.280 --> 36:59.820]  Apparently.
[37:00.620 --> 37:03.420]  Did someone fire the missile point blank at us?
[37:03.620 --> 37:04.760]  There was a car there!
[37:05.200 --> 37:06.100]  Alright, get in!
[37:06.740 --> 37:07.260]  Let's go boys!
[37:07.920 --> 37:09.900]  Andrew, get in the armored car!
[37:10.420 --> 37:11.960]  Over here!
[37:13.180 --> 37:14.060]  Oh no!
[37:14.960 --> 37:17.440]  Perfect! This is the worst place to be!
[37:17.600 --> 37:18.620]  You got it! It's perfect!
[37:18.780 --> 37:20.220]  You can run perfect defense!
[37:20.900 --> 37:22.240]  On this car without a tire!
[37:23.900 --> 37:25.060]  I'm calling Lester!
[37:26.260 --> 37:26.680]  Don't!
[37:27.660 --> 37:28.560]  We have to earn this!
[37:28.680 --> 37:30.220]  Gavin, does this fucking pump you up?
[37:33.160 --> 37:36.760]  Gavin, are you like fired up about this?
[37:37.520 --> 37:38.720]  You know, there's a lot going on.
[37:39.080 --> 37:39.400]  Yeah!
[37:39.400 --> 37:39.760]  Yeah!
[37:41.160 --> 37:41.980]  What song is it?
[37:45.580 --> 37:49.600]  Really like the sound of a switchblade and a motorbike!
[37:55.160 --> 37:56.660]  I'm pumped right now!
[37:57.560 --> 37:58.860]  Nick, I want to get in the back of that!
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.160]  Oh my god!
[38:05.780 --> 38:07.060]  They're right behind us!
[38:09.980 --> 38:11.480]  We might want to take one of those, by the way.
[38:11.540 --> 38:12.220]  They have better tires.
[38:13.820 --> 38:14.740]  Let's go boys!
[38:15.640 --> 38:17.620]  Oh my blood got in the window!
[38:18.160 --> 38:18.640]  Oh shoot!
[38:20.880 --> 38:21.240]  Snag!
[38:22.860 --> 38:24.380]  Oh, he drove us into a tree!
[38:24.400 --> 38:25.520]  What happened to the driver?
[38:27.520 --> 38:27.560]  I'm dead!
[38:27.560 --> 38:28.420]  I'm dead, you guys!
[38:30.420 --> 38:31.480]  We need to do one of those!
[38:31.800 --> 38:32.160]  Fuck!
[38:33.600 --> 38:35.280]  Oh, it's Eric! I've been shooting Eric!
[38:35.920 --> 38:36.680]  Don't shoot Eric!
[38:36.680 --> 38:37.480]  Oh!
[38:37.740 --> 38:39.160]  I shot all the tires!
[38:40.580 --> 38:41.240]  Let me in the back!
[38:41.780 --> 38:44.540]  Let me in the goddamn...
[38:44.540 --> 38:45.540]  Oh, I'm alone in the back!
[38:46.140 --> 38:47.040]  We're all on the right!
[38:49.660 --> 38:50.060]  No!
[38:50.740 --> 38:52.640]  I can't turn the radio off!
[38:54.340 --> 38:56.100]  Oh, there's more! Let's take them!
[38:57.740 --> 38:59.300]  Doesn't this get you pumped up, Andrew?
[39:00.280 --> 39:00.840]  One sec!
[39:01.560 --> 39:02.460]  I'm trying to get high!
[39:02.620 --> 39:03.320]  I'm trying to get high on speed!
[39:03.320 --> 39:03.980]  Setting...
[39:04.420 --> 39:06.200]  Making a decision...
[39:07.240 --> 39:08.180]  Kickstart my high!
[39:08.220 --> 39:10.060]  Can you guys get these guys off my tail, please?
[39:10.380 --> 39:11.400]  Yeah, big time.
[39:12.140 --> 39:14.780]  I didn't want to do this, but Eric made me!
[39:14.980 --> 39:15.740]  We got him!
[39:16.060 --> 39:17.460]  I turned off the radio. What are you doing?
[39:17.760 --> 39:18.180]  Oh!
[39:20.640 --> 39:21.900]  The radio's off!
[39:22.940 --> 39:24.340]  Did someone cook a grenade too long?
[39:24.900 --> 39:25.740]  Yeah, Andrew did.
[39:26.380 --> 39:28.900]  Andrew wanted to teach us a lesson, but I don't know what the lesson was.
[39:29.300 --> 39:31.160]  We're gonna get high on your high on speed!
[39:31.160 --> 39:32.000]  Oh, hell yeah!
[39:32.860 --> 39:34.360]  I got the briefcase.
[39:34.700 --> 39:36.440]  I got the briefcase, boys!
[39:36.920 --> 39:38.480]  No! We can't get to it!
[39:39.760 --> 39:40.700]  Get to the facility!
[39:41.220 --> 39:42.620]  You got it! We're going to the facility!
[39:43.460 --> 39:44.620]  Not just you, fool!
[39:46.320 --> 39:46.700]  Ah, shit!
[39:47.740 --> 39:48.260]  Saturday!
[39:48.780 --> 39:49.300]  Saturday!
[39:49.960 --> 39:50.480]  Saturday!
[39:50.920 --> 39:51.260]  Saturday!
[39:56.260 --> 39:56.780]  Buzzard!
[39:57.460 --> 39:58.200]  There it is!
[39:59.320 --> 40:00.360]  I'm on my way!
[40:00.580 --> 40:01.620]  Did they put it on the train track?
[40:04.420 --> 40:05.700]  That won't smell this acid!
[40:05.700 --> 40:06.660]  I bet I can get to it!
[40:07.820 --> 40:08.840]  I'm trying to get there!
[40:09.400 --> 40:10.340]  Alright, I got it!
[40:12.800 --> 40:13.620]  Hop in, boys!
[40:14.500 --> 40:15.040]  Almost there!
[40:15.500 --> 40:16.460]  Swoop down and get me!
[40:17.400 --> 40:17.560]  Okay!
[40:22.120 --> 40:23.240]  This is a good video!
[40:23.460 --> 40:24.100]  No swoop needed!
[40:26.060 --> 40:28.080]  Just so you know, this is a good video!
[40:30.400 --> 40:31.960]  Good for the music industry!
[40:32.960 --> 40:33.980]  It's good for the labels!
[40:36.680 --> 40:37.400]  Alright, fellas!
[40:38.140 --> 40:39.740]  And away we go!
[40:55.940 --> 40:58.740]  The rockstar music for this sounds like they brought John Carpenter in.
[41:01.740 --> 41:03.480]  I want to watch The Thing again.
[41:04.180 --> 41:05.500]  Yeah! That's a good idea.
[41:07.260 --> 41:07.960]  Great movie.
[41:08.360 --> 41:10.140]  I never saw the prequel one.
[41:10.600 --> 41:11.520]  I think I want to watch that too.
[41:12.360 --> 41:13.340]  Yeah, but I like that.
[41:13.540 --> 41:14.140]  I love the universe.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.700]  They undid some of the magic, I think, in the original way.
[41:18.300 --> 41:19.060]  Trying to tie it.
[41:21.700 --> 41:23.580]  Also, they did not use any practical effects.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.360]  Well, I think they did, but then they just CG'd over it later.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.380]  I like when they do that. I think that's cool.
[41:29.780 --> 41:31.560]  I like tricking people. I think that's awesome.
[41:34.420 --> 41:35.940]  So they did it, but then they undid it.
[41:35.940 --> 41:37.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like when they trick people.
[41:37.820 --> 41:39.560]  I like when you make a sequel to a movie
[41:39.560 --> 41:40.960]  and you go, hey, the last two didn't count.
[41:41.140 --> 41:43.300]  This one's for the fans. That's my favorite.
[41:44.440 --> 41:44.920]  Halloween?
[41:46.320 --> 41:47.660]  Hey, Eddie, you name it.
[41:49.160 --> 41:49.920]  Good holiday.
[41:54.080 --> 41:56.040]  You'll never catch me. I'm the General Lee.
[41:59.760 --> 42:01.420]  Ah! General Lee!
[42:04.780 --> 42:07.620]  No, no, no! You caught the General Lee!
[42:09.520 --> 42:11.000]  Well, boss hog wishes.
[42:14.700 --> 42:15.700]  Take me there.
[42:18.560 --> 42:19.460]  I've arrived.
[42:27.090 --> 42:29.270]  I did it. Nice!
[42:29.830 --> 42:31.070]  Alright, let's keep this chopper alive.
[42:32.210 --> 42:33.390]  Oh, uh, you fly away.
[42:33.530 --> 42:35.050]  Oh my god!
[42:38.750 --> 42:41.190]  I love hearing, oh, uh...
[42:41.190 --> 42:41.850]  That's pretty cool.
[42:46.370 --> 42:47.050]  Bastard hole.
[42:48.390 --> 42:49.630]  I'm sorry, Gavin.
[42:50.490 --> 42:51.330]  What you got there, bud?
[42:57.950 --> 42:59.030]  It was green.
[42:59.110 --> 43:00.810]  It wouldn't let me fire it because it was friendly fire,
[43:00.910 --> 43:02.970]  so I put it slightly to the side of your head
[43:02.970 --> 43:04.950]  and somehow it hit you right in the grid.
[43:07.410 --> 43:09.170]  It knocked the shit out of me.
[43:11.050 --> 43:12.370]  I was not expecting that.
[43:13.010 --> 43:13.810]  That was awesome.
[43:14.790 --> 43:15.650]  Piss off, Samir.
[43:15.710 --> 43:17.190]  You've been calling me for 12 years.
[43:20.330 --> 43:21.470]  Here we go.
[43:23.370 --> 43:25.190]  I want my front door to do that with lights.
[43:25.610 --> 43:27.250]  Hell yeah. Alright, what are we taking?
[43:28.770 --> 43:29.570]  Oh, that's not mine.
[43:30.410 --> 43:30.710]  What?
[43:31.590 --> 43:33.410]  What did I bring? I brought...
[43:33.410 --> 43:34.310]  Alright, Andrew, me and you.
[43:34.770 --> 43:35.630]  I brought this.
[43:37.710 --> 43:40.070]  And because you're driving, I won't even turn on the radio.
[43:40.450 --> 43:42.090]  You know what? You have permission to turn on the radio.
[43:42.090 --> 43:42.910]  Woah!
[43:44.750 --> 43:46.730]  If you encourage it, I'll listen to Stevie Nicks.
[43:47.390 --> 43:48.170]  Oh, hell yeah.
[43:49.270 --> 43:50.270]  Oh my god!
[43:51.910 --> 43:52.970]  You saved me.
[43:53.290 --> 43:55.690]  You saved me from a fate worse than death.
[43:56.090 --> 43:58.230]  Why is the Achievement Hunter logo on the front of your car, Andrew?
[43:58.710 --> 43:59.350]  Is it?
[44:00.570 --> 44:01.390]  I don't know.
[44:01.410 --> 44:02.510]  Are you on Scramtown?
[44:03.450 --> 44:03.910]  No.
[44:05.350 --> 44:08.050]  I think it might just be the custom paint job for this vehicle.
[44:08.410 --> 44:09.050]  That's pretty cool.
[44:09.790 --> 44:11.770]  I lost all my doors on this armored car.
[44:11.950 --> 44:13.090]  I lost the...
[44:13.090 --> 44:13.510]  Oh god.
[44:15.090 --> 44:15.970]  Oh shit.
[44:17.070 --> 44:17.290]  Pitted.
[44:17.610 --> 44:19.630]  I pitted you into a car that pitted me.
[44:22.630 --> 44:23.830]  Every action is a man.
[44:28.810 --> 44:29.250]  Woah!
[44:39.930 --> 44:40.330]  Woah!
[44:40.650 --> 44:41.050]  Oh my god.
[44:41.250 --> 44:41.470]  Hello.
[44:43.390 --> 44:44.870]  Getting rid of that logo.
[44:45.770 --> 44:46.630]  Gotta get it off there.
[44:47.470 --> 44:47.870]  Exactly.
[44:49.990 --> 44:51.830]  Half the video is going to Stevie Nicks.
[44:51.910 --> 44:52.930]  The other half is going to Bernie.
[44:52.930 --> 44:53.670]  We got it.
[44:59.890 --> 45:03.470]  Oh, we can sing, but no radio?
[45:03.650 --> 45:03.850]  Okay.
[45:04.630 --> 45:06.470]  We don't sound close enough to a song.
[45:07.990 --> 45:09.190]  What if we sang
[45:09.190 --> 45:11.050]  so good that we got a
[45:11.050 --> 45:11.730]  copyright strike?
[45:12.710 --> 45:14.950]  We should do that. Do you think that there's a song
[45:14.950 --> 45:16.990]  that you can sing so close to the actual song
[45:16.990 --> 45:18.110]  that you get copyright strike?
[45:18.850 --> 45:19.490]  The Whisper song.
[45:19.490 --> 45:19.830]  The Wolf.
[45:22.090 --> 45:23.830]  We should try this for a supplemental.
[45:27.070 --> 45:27.290]  Oh.
[45:29.090 --> 45:30.550]  I don't know if I like that idea.
[45:30.870 --> 45:31.110]  Why?
[45:32.850 --> 45:33.510]  Let's do it.
[45:33.610 --> 45:35.410]  As soon as we get struck, we just take it down.
[45:35.890 --> 45:39.270]  You have to do it every week until you do.
[45:41.970 --> 45:43.650]  86 videos of Nick singing
[45:43.650 --> 45:44.710]  Hungry like the Wolf.
[45:45.090 --> 45:47.110]  There was a burrito place in San Antonio
[45:47.110 --> 45:48.770]  that had a rock band competition
[45:48.770 --> 45:51.430]  and you had to have a team of four, which meant someone had to sing.
[45:51.890 --> 45:52.470]  So I had to sing.
[45:53.230 --> 45:54.670]  You could have just gone home.
[45:56.090 --> 45:57.150]  Well, here's the thing
[45:57.150 --> 45:59.070]  about me and free food, Gavin.
[45:59.370 --> 46:00.990]  Is that what you were going to win?
[46:01.570 --> 46:03.130]  It was like a $100
[46:03.130 --> 46:05.370]  gift card. That's a shitload of free food.
[46:06.050 --> 46:06.910]  Yeah, and we won.
[46:07.610 --> 46:08.170]  Oh, nice.
[46:08.510 --> 46:09.650]  Was it Hungry like the Wolf?
[46:10.330 --> 46:12.110]  Did you have to split the card?
[46:14.170 --> 46:15.210]  Well, had to.
[46:16.030 --> 46:16.810]  Chose to.
[46:17.510 --> 46:18.630]  Had to. That's had to.
[46:19.110 --> 46:20.030]  You don't know food Nick that well.
[46:20.030 --> 46:23.030]  Was the Wolf able to be fed off of $25?
[46:23.510 --> 46:24.070]  I sure did.
[46:24.510 --> 46:26.850]  Oh man, we feasted well on queso
[46:26.850 --> 46:28.290]  and margaritas.
[46:29.890 --> 46:30.870]  Like twice?
[46:32.330 --> 46:33.490]  Probably just that night.
[46:36.110 --> 46:37.650]  Yeah, margaritas are a good way
[46:37.650 --> 46:39.250]  to blow through your free food budget.
[46:40.150 --> 46:40.650]  Hell yeah.
[46:41.030 --> 46:41.910]  But it's free margaritas.
[46:41.910 --> 46:41.970]  It is.
[46:44.370 --> 46:45.490]  The restaurant's like,
[46:45.770 --> 46:47.530]  these guys are idiots.
[46:47.690 --> 46:48.170]  This is great.
[46:48.790 --> 46:49.970]  Fell for it again, we put it on YouTube.
[46:54.210 --> 46:55.410]  Burned to the ground!
[46:56.410 --> 46:57.330]  Wasn't our man!
[47:01.590 --> 47:02.110]  Yeah.
[47:03.350 --> 47:04.010]  We got there first.
[47:05.030 --> 47:06.050]  We got there first.
[47:08.990 --> 47:09.510]  Hello!
[47:09.510 --> 47:11.390]  We have no lives, remember.
[47:11.470 --> 47:12.590]  And welcome to Taskmaster.
[47:14.710 --> 47:15.290]  Oh, we do have lives.
[47:15.410 --> 47:16.730]  Gotta stop fucking around.
[47:18.190 --> 47:21.150]  Hey, that guy sounded like Geoff when he said, what the fuck.
[47:22.610 --> 47:22.970]  What?
[47:23.750 --> 47:25.070]  This guy screamed, what the fuck!
[47:25.230 --> 47:26.510]  Oh, I see.
[47:32.450 --> 47:33.410]  That guy called me an asshole.
[47:34.010 --> 47:36.890]  Thought you said, this guy sounded like Geoff when he said, let's fuck.
[47:37.510 --> 47:37.790]  What?
[47:37.930 --> 47:40.090]  You wanna talk about something, Nick? You wanna reveal something?
[47:40.650 --> 47:43.150]  Holy shit, I blew all the detail out of this port-a-potty.
[47:43.930 --> 47:44.690]  That's pretty cool.
[47:45.090 --> 47:46.070]  Am I hiding in it?
[47:46.250 --> 47:47.070]  What am I doing?
[47:47.150 --> 47:48.150]  What is our port-a-potty doing?
[47:49.430 --> 47:50.890]  Yeah, how is the port-a-potty?
[47:52.290 --> 47:53.210]  Holding up a mural.
[47:55.090 --> 47:56.710]  There's like, there's no liquid in it, right?
[47:57.970 --> 47:58.710]  Yeah, it's full of piss.
[48:00.370 --> 48:01.310]  It's full of strumming.
[48:02.070 --> 48:03.650]  Yeah, you have to tell Dan not to go in there.
[48:05.110 --> 48:06.570]  I don't think he's noticed it yet.
[48:07.290 --> 48:07.610]  What?
[48:07.610 --> 48:08.670]  That sounds right.
[48:09.790 --> 48:10.450]  Hey, man.
[48:11.350 --> 48:13.350]  We're here to save you.
[48:13.510 --> 48:13.770]  Ah!
[48:15.870 --> 48:16.990]  We're here to save you.
[48:18.790 --> 48:19.750]  Where's this last guy?
[48:20.230 --> 48:20.750]  Is he in here?
[48:21.450 --> 48:21.890]  I'll get him.
[48:26.050 --> 48:27.550]  Where is he? Is he upstairs?
[48:28.670 --> 48:29.310]  Oh, here he is.
[48:31.690 --> 48:32.390]  Okay, he's dead.
[48:32.950 --> 48:33.330]  Sweet.
[48:33.330 --> 48:34.350]  Sweet.
[48:36.410 --> 48:38.130]  Just keeping him safe.
[48:39.450 --> 48:40.830]  What does take cover mean?
[48:43.530 --> 48:44.150]  Oh.
[48:44.490 --> 48:46.990]  Our goggles are getting updated?
[48:47.110 --> 48:48.630]  How do I get my...
[48:50.050 --> 48:51.350]  How do I make
[48:51.350 --> 48:52.090]  my goggles work?
[48:53.810 --> 48:54.630]  Oh, what?
[48:54.890 --> 48:56.010]  Oh, shit!
[48:57.950 --> 48:58.530]  Oh my god!
[48:58.950 --> 48:59.730]  That's not us!
[48:59.730 --> 49:01.390]  It's robot juggernauts.
[49:01.910 --> 49:04.230]  What the hell? How are we supposed to fight these things?
[49:04.450 --> 49:05.570]  How do we put on our goggles?
[49:07.290 --> 49:07.410]  Ah!
[49:07.870 --> 49:08.630]  Oh, shit!
[49:10.930 --> 49:11.990]  Don't forget about
[49:11.990 --> 49:13.870]  eating snacks and the weapon wheel.
[49:14.330 --> 49:15.650]  Holy shitball.
[49:16.710 --> 49:17.870]  How the hell am I supposed
[49:17.870 --> 49:19.350]  to fight these jackholes?
[49:20.690 --> 49:21.490]  One's down.
[49:24.230 --> 49:25.070]  Grenade out.
[49:26.110 --> 49:26.970]  We get them?
[49:26.970 --> 49:27.730]  Okay, they're dead.
[49:28.490 --> 49:29.390]  Hey, good job.
[49:29.970 --> 49:30.970]  Oh, shit!
[49:31.590 --> 49:31.710]  Oh!
[49:31.870 --> 49:32.030]  Oh!
[49:39.130 --> 49:41.090]  Snacks getting chewed through.
[49:42.190 --> 49:42.390]  Oh!
[49:42.870 --> 49:43.570]  What the hell?
[49:45.610 --> 49:47.270]  Gavin, what the fuck?
[49:48.830 --> 49:50.950]  I guess the pallet that was in front of me
[49:50.950 --> 49:51.590]  wasn't very hot.
[49:51.730 --> 49:53.170]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:56.970 --> 49:57.290]  Shit.
[49:58.370 --> 50:00.970]  Hey, this next time, the thing we learned
[50:00.970 --> 50:02.590]  is don't blow yourself up, moron.
[50:03.190 --> 50:03.730]  Yeah, that's fair.
[50:05.250 --> 50:06.010]  Got you there.
[50:07.970 --> 50:08.950]  The nice thing about
[50:08.950 --> 50:10.830]  doing these things with Gavin, and I'd love to talk
[50:10.830 --> 50:11.610]  to Geoff about this,
[50:12.530 --> 50:14.810]  is the amount of patience you
[50:14.810 --> 50:16.010]  bank against him.
[50:17.210 --> 50:19.050]  You're like, you know what, that was accepted.
[50:19.170 --> 50:21.010]  The amount of time that he needs
[50:21.010 --> 50:21.930]  to be willing to give.
[50:30.700 --> 50:31.980]  Here we go.
[50:35.320 --> 50:37.360]  Oh, we've got fire all over the place in here.
[50:38.300 --> 50:39.380]  Yeah, I think, uh,
[50:39.400 --> 50:40.920]  did you do that? I think you did that.
[50:41.120 --> 50:42.380]  Not me. I did that. That was me.
[50:42.460 --> 50:45.520]  Oh, Gavin! I'm on fire!
[50:46.020 --> 50:46.420]  How'd you do that?
[50:50.140 --> 50:51.460]  That sounds like a you problem.
[50:51.840 --> 50:53.220]  Yeah. Well, it was mostly to tell him
[50:53.220 --> 50:54.340]  because he was walking next to me.
[50:56.020 --> 50:56.680]  Ah, okay.
[50:56.680 --> 50:57.640]  That's fair.
[50:57.940 --> 51:00.420]  It was a warning that wasn't very good.
[51:01.340 --> 51:02.740]  Well, at least it wasn't very good.
[51:03.600 --> 51:04.420]  That was still a warning.
[51:09.750 --> 51:10.770]  Okay, one more top right.
[51:14.850 --> 51:15.450]  Ah,
[51:15.490 --> 51:15.950]  die.
[51:17.150 --> 51:17.650]  There we go.
[51:19.930 --> 51:21.130]  Okay, Guggernauts.
[51:23.030 --> 51:25.110]  I'm gonna probably not use the RPG.
[51:25.930 --> 51:26.970]  Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
[51:30.670 --> 51:33.030]  I remember correctly, this is an extremely
[51:33.030 --> 51:34.910]  long sequence with no checkpoints.
[51:35.510 --> 51:36.890]  But get ready. Oh, is it?
[51:37.750 --> 51:39.230]  I think we have to go through, like,
[51:39.650 --> 51:40.730]  30 Guggernauts.
[51:41.110 --> 51:42.830]  No, no, no.
[51:43.250 --> 51:44.990]  Yeah, I remember this being hell.
[51:48.810 --> 51:49.750]  Oh, fuck.
[51:50.810 --> 51:52.690]  Move me, move me. That's some bullshit.
[51:52.690 --> 51:54.690]  Oh, okay.
[51:55.490 --> 51:56.650]  I can see them with the thermal.
[51:57.590 --> 51:57.930]  What?
[51:58.990 --> 51:59.470]  What?
[52:00.130 --> 52:01.730]  I was targeting them without it last time.
[52:01.770 --> 52:03.190]  Are you doing a bit?
[52:04.330 --> 52:04.810]  Nope.
[52:07.030 --> 52:07.210]  Nope.
[52:09.490 --> 52:10.450]  Hey, Gavin.
[52:16.770 --> 52:17.470]  Hey, Gavin.
[52:18.410 --> 52:19.130]  What happened?
[52:21.010 --> 52:22.690]  I was so blown away
[52:22.690 --> 52:23.810]  at what Nick was saying that
[52:24.350 --> 52:25.790]  I just was not looking
[52:25.790 --> 52:26.250]  at my health.
[52:27.470 --> 52:29.410]  I wanna be clear that
[52:30.750 --> 52:31.790]  I have not
[52:31.790 --> 52:33.410]  died yet. Yeah, that's true.
[52:33.790 --> 52:35.890]  Only one person has
[52:35.890 --> 52:37.570]  and it's twice. It's very easy to
[52:37.570 --> 52:38.830]  keep track.
[52:40.930 --> 52:41.870]  Well, you know what they say about me?
[52:41.890 --> 52:42.370]  Two and done.
[52:43.730 --> 52:45.450]  Is that what they say? Yep.
[52:46.070 --> 52:47.310]  I never do anything three times.
[52:50.950 --> 52:51.690]  Alright, boys.
[52:51.690 --> 52:52.310]  Here we go.
[53:14.590 --> 53:15.630]  Holy shit.
[53:15.890 --> 53:16.650]  Two down.
[53:17.810 --> 53:18.690]  And they're down.
[53:23.650 --> 53:24.690]  I'm back.
[53:26.190 --> 53:27.210]  You shoved me.
[53:27.850 --> 53:29.510]  Well, Andrew died, so it's fine.
[53:31.910 --> 53:33.710]  See, that's why they call him Gavin two times.
[53:35.930 --> 53:37.190]  Because he fails twice
[53:37.190 --> 53:38.290]  and then it's everyone else's fault.
[53:40.930 --> 53:43.070]  See, I bank on everyone else losing patience
[53:43.070 --> 53:44.910]  after my two deaths that they start dying.
[53:48.580 --> 53:49.440]  And it's working.
[53:49.980 --> 53:52.480]  But he did spend the entire round trying to push
[53:52.480 --> 53:54.620]  furniture. That is true. I agree.
[53:55.020 --> 53:56.680]  I do agree with that.
[53:56.840 --> 53:57.860]  Is it good, the furniture?
[53:59.180 --> 54:00.400]  You can sit on it, right?
[54:03.760 --> 54:04.200]  Checkmate?
[54:08.660 --> 54:09.340]  You can sit on a chessboard.
[54:10.900 --> 54:11.300]  Checkmate?
[54:12.800 --> 54:14.920]  I mean, a chessboard can be decorative.
[54:16.940 --> 54:18.180]  If you fell
[54:18.720 --> 54:20.700]  onto a chessboard, which would be the
[54:20.700 --> 54:21.720]  best piece to get stuck?
[54:22.440 --> 54:23.200]  The pawn?
[54:24.420 --> 54:26.540]  Like, what do you think? The rook?
[54:26.760 --> 54:27.580]  What are you talking about?
[54:28.700 --> 54:30.780]  The worst one has to be the knight, right?
[54:30.960 --> 54:32.140]  No, the bishop would suck.
[54:32.260 --> 54:33.340]  The bishop would be terrible.
[54:33.840 --> 54:36.280]  It's just assholes bad. They're all bad.
[54:36.280 --> 54:38.320]  I mean, yeah, the rook would be pretty brutal.
[54:38.780 --> 54:40.440]  I feel like the one on the way out
[54:40.440 --> 54:40.940]  is the worst.
[54:44.760 --> 54:45.640]  Too much courage.
[54:47.100 --> 54:47.720]  I am
[54:47.720 --> 54:49.540]  very efficient at killing these guys.
[54:50.360 --> 54:51.500]  I've gotten really good.
[54:52.160 --> 54:54.000]  Yeah, Gavin's trying new methods.
[54:54.560 --> 54:55.200]  Oh, shit!
[54:55.320 --> 54:56.000]  I got a couple of them.
[54:56.880 --> 54:58.780]  It's an armored car. We might as well just sit in this.
[55:00.080 --> 55:00.500]  Why?
[55:01.400 --> 55:02.400]  To take longer?
[55:04.220 --> 55:05.760]  Well, when the juggernauts come, we can just
[55:05.760 --> 55:06.340]  run them over.
[55:07.060 --> 55:09.640]  Oh, I see. Do you think that the cars would survive?
[55:10.080 --> 55:11.640]  I don't know. Let me put the car in the bit
[55:11.640 --> 55:12.720]  where it spawns us.
[55:13.380 --> 55:15.040]  Oh, good. That worked last time with the girder.
[55:18.360 --> 55:18.700]  I...
[55:19.580 --> 55:20.100]  What's wrong?
[55:21.500 --> 55:22.040]  You good?
[55:22.800 --> 55:26.040]  I don't know if I've ever been as annoyed as I am right now, Gavin.
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.200]  Why are you doing it?
[55:27.700 --> 55:29.880]  I'm trying to get out of your way. You keep standing in front of the car.
[55:29.900 --> 55:32.360]  You keep running me over. You don't give me time to move.
[55:36.660 --> 55:37.800]  Oh my god.
[55:38.020 --> 55:40.540]  Can you kill one person in this sequence?
[55:40.900 --> 55:41.300]  He did once.
[55:41.300 --> 55:42.720]  Yeah, I ran over two people.
[55:44.220 --> 55:45.460]  Yeah, that equals death.
[55:45.640 --> 55:47.240]  Alright, so if I get in this car...
[55:47.240 --> 55:47.540]  Uh-huh.
[55:49.380 --> 55:51.480]  You're gonna turn me into a triple kill for him.
[55:52.680 --> 55:54.200]  So you think it's gonna spawn you
[55:54.200 --> 55:54.880]  in the car?
[55:55.640 --> 55:56.960]  Maybe if I'm in the car now.
[55:57.320 --> 55:59.660]  No, it's gonna spawn you out of the car.
[55:59.740 --> 56:01.200]  It's been moving me every time.
[56:02.500 --> 56:03.820]  Alright, I'll leave the car.
[56:03.820 --> 56:04.700]  Okay.
[56:05.320 --> 56:07.300]  You don't think it's gonna move the car altogether?
[56:07.540 --> 56:07.840]  I don't know.
[56:10.520 --> 56:11.880]  I'm excited to find out.
[56:13.020 --> 56:13.980]  We will...
[56:13.980 --> 56:15.680]  discover more things
[56:15.680 --> 56:16.760]  that will be useless.
[56:19.240 --> 56:19.900]  Car's gone.
[56:20.560 --> 56:21.240]  No, car's there.
[56:21.500 --> 56:22.820]  Car's there. I'm getting it.
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.760]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[56:26.560 --> 56:26.820]  What?
[56:27.340 --> 56:27.820]  What?
[56:30.440 --> 56:31.780]  Every moment of that.
[56:31.780 --> 56:32.620]  Gavin died.
[56:34.140 --> 56:35.840]  He just doesn't value our time.
[56:36.100 --> 56:36.460]  Nope.
[56:37.760 --> 56:39.080]  Wait, is it not a...
[56:39.580 --> 56:40.840]  Three time free.
[56:41.400 --> 56:42.600]  It's just a car.
[56:43.060 --> 56:43.940]  I thought it had three.
[56:45.180 --> 56:48.240]  It's armor-proof except for the windows, which makes it useless.
[56:48.440 --> 56:49.560]  So it's not like the Insurgent.
[56:50.020 --> 56:50.380]  Right.
[56:51.580 --> 56:53.240]  That was more me in the lab, I would say.
[56:53.360 --> 56:54.560]  I don't know if that fully counts.
[56:54.720 --> 56:57.280]  Yeah, I think get the fuck out of the lab and try to kill these guys.
[56:57.700 --> 56:59.960]  Alright. Loud and clear. Let's do it.
[56:59.960 --> 57:02.060]  Whoa, look at these guys.
[57:02.200 --> 57:02.900]  Holy shit.
[57:03.060 --> 57:04.440]  Oh my god, they turn invisible?
[57:04.880 --> 57:06.860]  That's nuts. How are we supposed to see them, Andrew?
[57:08.080 --> 57:10.400]  Maybe if there's an upgrade to our...
[57:10.400 --> 57:11.660]  Glasses? Or goggles?
[57:13.540 --> 57:14.380]  That's a shotgun.
[57:18.560 --> 57:19.260]  Gavin died.
[57:20.700 --> 57:21.160]  Oh...
[57:27.750 --> 57:28.210]  What...
[57:28.210 --> 57:29.710]  The fuck is wrong with you?
[57:32.530 --> 57:34.290]  Dude, these guys are gonna be so easy to kill.
[57:34.370 --> 57:35.130]  I can see them the whole...
[57:35.130 --> 57:35.650]  Oh no.
[57:36.410 --> 57:38.010]  Oh my god.
[57:40.750 --> 57:41.550]  Thermals on.
[57:45.250 --> 57:45.650]  Whoa!
[57:47.690 --> 57:48.730]  How do you switch shoulder?
[57:49.610 --> 57:50.670]  I don't know.
[57:56.140 --> 57:56.540]  Move.
[57:57.840 --> 57:58.620]  Everything's on fire.
[57:58.700 --> 57:59.820]  It's hard to tell what's a man.
[58:01.020 --> 58:02.340]  Oh shit, there's way more.
[58:02.340 --> 58:04.340]  Is there a man hiding behind...
[58:04.900 --> 58:05.360]  This over there?
[58:06.060 --> 58:06.840]  Oh god.
[58:07.780 --> 58:08.660]  Ah shit.
[58:10.220 --> 58:12.180]  I died. How the fuck did I die?
[58:12.480 --> 58:13.520]  What blew me up?
[58:14.940 --> 58:16.360]  Is there a guy with a rocket launcher?
[58:17.460 --> 58:18.560]  I had a rocket launcher,
[58:18.640 --> 58:19.680]  but it shouldn't be friendly fire.
[58:21.620 --> 58:22.760]  Nah, it wouldn't be friendly
[58:22.760 --> 58:24.200]  unless you hit like a tank or something.
[58:24.460 --> 58:26.640]  When I died, I did like a flip.
[58:40.060 --> 58:40.480]  Oh Jesus.
[58:42.020 --> 58:43.540]  Oh, this is bad for the
[58:43.540 --> 58:44.640]  second wave, I think.
[58:45.060 --> 58:47.160]  Yeah, it's really bad. Like, when the second wave comes around,
[58:47.300 --> 58:48.160]  I have to move back here.
[58:53.600 --> 58:54.320]  Oh god!
[58:55.800 --> 58:56.640]  Holy shit!
[58:56.940 --> 58:57.840]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[58:58.680 --> 58:59.520]  My thumbs!
[59:00.560 --> 59:04.720]  Ow! Ow!
[59:04.720 --> 59:04.920]  Ow!
[59:05.680 --> 59:07.120]  Where are they now?
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.280]  Oh my god!
[59:09.540 --> 59:09.560]  No!
[59:11.460 --> 59:13.440]  Shredded through, dude.
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.260]  God damn.
[59:17.140 --> 59:18.380]  Where's safe?
[59:18.860 --> 59:19.860]  I don't know.
[59:20.480 --> 59:21.720]  Do we dive into the middle?
[59:23.660 --> 59:24.180]  Oh.
[59:24.700 --> 59:25.080]  Zero!
[59:26.740 --> 59:28.520]  That's not a bad idea.
[59:28.900 --> 59:29.560]  Zero!
[59:30.520 --> 59:31.720]  Zero kills for Gavin.
[59:33.660 --> 59:34.060]  What?!
[59:34.060 --> 59:34.580]  Zero!
[59:35.360 --> 59:36.480]  Dinged a couple of them up.
[59:37.520 --> 59:38.780]  Zero kills for Gavin.
[59:53.050 --> 59:54.710]  Got him. Okay, first round's done.
[59:55.290 --> 59:55.850]  Quick and easy.
[59:57.170 --> 59:58.730]  Oh, I don't want to be here right next to Gavin.
[59:59.370 --> 01:00:00.310]  Shit, sorry, sorry.
[01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.790]  What happened that time?
[01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:04.770]  Uh, I just, I didn't
[01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.710]  move fast enough out of the way, and they
[01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.970]  shamed me. I'm gonna try to jump down
[01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:10.450]  in the middle this time. I'm gonna
[01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.550]  see if that's, like, after we take out
[01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:14.250]  the first guys, I'm gonna jump down in the middle
[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.170]  and see if there's just a way I can make that work.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.220]  Oh. Nick died.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.360]  I didn't even get to use my line.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.400]  Save it.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.500]  This is it. This is the run.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.240]  Don't forget
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.500]  you can re-heal from the weapon wheel.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.060]  Yep. Okay.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:39.760]  Oh god.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.640]  That doesn't work
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.220]  at all.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.500]  Oh, that's
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.320]  not good.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.400]  Oh god. Holy shit!
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:53.780]  Alright, two
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.040]  down.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600]  Stay alive.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.760]  Shit. Bam.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.060]  You got down.
[01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:12.270]  Did that get him?
[01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:14.050]  No. Fuck.
[01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.710]  Got one.
[01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:22.370]  Okay.
[01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.970]  One more.
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.980]  Our choppers or their choppers?
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:30.940]  Their choppers.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.260]  They're down.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.320]  Here come the goons.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.980]  Are they invisible choppers?
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.860]  No. I don't think so.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.920]  So if we want to go blow up the choppers, I'm sure we can.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.300]  I don't have anything for it.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.080]  Oh, they're dropping people.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:46.420]  Yep.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.160]  Got one.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.000]  Nice. Nice.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.260]  Got two. Keep it going, bud.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.200]  This is raining people and stuff.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.020]  Way to go, Nick.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.980]  Great job, Nick. Way to go, dude.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.360]  Gavin Free committed suicide.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.280]  Are you kidding me?
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:03.440]  Gavin!
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.300]  Gavin.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.020]  Thoughts?
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.840]  I don't know what happened.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.240]  What do you mean?
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.520]  Why are you using something
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.660]  that can blow you up?
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.720]  Blow up the helicopters and it was...
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.440]  It was working
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.520]  and then suddenly...
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.600]  And then suddenly...
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600]  And then what happened, Gavin?
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.760]  Well, I didn't move and I was just firing
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.040]  and then I blew up.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.940]  I just don't know why you're using something
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.140]  that's going to blow you up.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.460]  Blow up the choppers and that.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.340]  Oh, wait!
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.100]  Oh, no way!
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.960]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:42.720]  Unbelievable.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.960]  He is so lucky.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.560]  Gavin, you're so...
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.640]  Gavin, you're so fucking lucky.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.460]  Alright, if there's helicopters, can you guys take them out?
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.940]  Oh, I'm shooting them down right now.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.680]  I'm kind of scared too after what just happened.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:53.980]  Wait.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.980]  What do we got, boys? Let's do it.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.960]  No helicopters, just guys.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.600]  I can do this all day,
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.400]  but we're not going to.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.500]  We're going to beat it.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.640]  That's right.
[01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:18.650]  Flanking.
[01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:19.650]  There we go.
[01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:21.690]  You guys can push up.
[01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:25.170]  Push up, push up.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.420]  There we go.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:31.600]  Keep pushing.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.120]  Yep.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.640]  Chopper's coming in.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.980]  Anyone can get that or no?
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.100]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:43.420]  Nice.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:43.960]  Good shooting.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.140]  There you go.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.580]  Fish in a barrel.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.560]  Can we get up to the high ground?
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:52.920]  Are you going to fall?
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.580]  I was just thinking in my head,
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.520]  bottom left, Gavin fell to his death.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.260]  Ah, shit.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.020]  The freaking porta-potties.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:08.840]  Why are you...
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.460]  Who's shooting rockets? Is it Gavin or is it Nick?
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.420]  It's me.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.100]  Okay, you can trust me.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.060]  I trust you. As long as it's not Gavin, it's fine.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:18.980]  Times are changing.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.360]  Turn off that damn radio.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.160]  Some folks bone.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.080]  Bone, baby.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.200]  Oh, shit.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.700]  Oh, shit.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.000]  Go back.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.560]  Fall back.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.040]  Let me out.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:53.460]  Boy, I was one hit away.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.020]  There's two at the...
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.220]  Yeah.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.340]  That far end.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.700]  Oh, your laser saved my life.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.560]  I saw that.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.680]  Laser saved my...
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.720]  At one, down.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.520]  Keep doing it.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.440]  There you go, boys.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.280]  Way to go.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.840]  Oh, they're on the outside.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.560]  Yeah, I was...
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.820]  Oh, there's a door.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.020]  It's a helicopter.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.240]  I can't shoot through this window?
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.840]  Nuh-uh. I was trying to do that the whole time.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:29.400]  I'll go around.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.540]  You can't go around.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.420]  You have to go south.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.820]  You have to go down towards the water to go back up.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.080]  To take them out.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.060]  Nice.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.120]  More of them.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.300]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.340]  On a shit sandwich.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.080]  Holy shit.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:50.960]  What's going on?
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:52.500]  Juggernauts.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.120]  From where?
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.740]  They're to the north now.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.720]  They're shooting the shit out of the wall from somewhere.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.280]  Yeah.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.640]  They're up to, like, the north.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:06.800]  Oh, why would you bomb me?
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.280]  Sorry.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.360]  One of them is just aiming at my cover.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.300]  I'm just getting hammered over here.
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.380]  If I lean out, I'm dead.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.280]  Yeah, same here.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.400]  Don't lean out.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:20.780]  No, I'm not.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.540]  One guy down, but there's two...
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.100]  Where are they?
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.300]  I see him.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:29.900]  I'm booking it.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.700]  Goddamn, you want to give it a rest, son?
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.820]  Oh, I'm just getting rinsed.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.600]  Oh, nice.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.320]  I can go high.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.360]  How are you doing that and not getting shot?
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.740]  I assume the attention is elsewhere.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:44.340]  Okay.
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:49.280]  Dude, I don't know.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.880]  Can anyone get these guys?
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:52.180]  Yep.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.720]  I'm about to get an angle on them.
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:54.880]  I got an angle.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.600]  Oh, no.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.100]  Hold on.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:58.440]  Hold on.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:03.540]  One's dead.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:04.700]  Who's dead?
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:05.400]  Nice.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.860]  How do I get down?
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.080]  Gavin, are you going to ride with Nick or what?
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.200]  Can you pick me up?
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.580]  We're out of seats. We literally don't have room.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.120]  Nick, can you pick me up?
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.640]  Where are you? Are you on the roof?
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.760]  I was also on the roof.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:28.640]  I just found a ladder.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.400]  He's scared.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.400]  Gavin hands.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.280]  Okay, Gavin, just hold tight.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:39.380]  Dude, this is...
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.820]  I don't want to go under the bridge. I don't want to do anything.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.480]  This sucks.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.000]  There was only three seats in that?
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:49.980]  No, I think there's four.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:50.600]  I don't know, Gavin.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.440]  He told me to take off. I took off.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.260]  I got you, Gavin, whatever your name is.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.580]  That was intense.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:19.350]  It was not nice getting caught.
[01:08:19.570 --> 01:08:21.550]  I do the same run every morning.
[01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:23.170]  Only this morning...
[01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:24.550]  What is...
[01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:26.970]  ...before my pulse hit 80.
[01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:28.730]  I should have changed my routine.
[01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.770]  Too predictable.
[01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:33.090]  Stop posting running times to social media.
[01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:36.720]  But what's the point in running...
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.200]  At least this guy just doesn't shut the fuck up.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.600]  Hey, but you know what?
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.740]  He's got a point. If you're going to run, people should know about it.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.240]  I'm not too high.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.220]  I'm so low.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.180]  Holy shit, Nick.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.620]  Holy shit, Nick.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.380]  Hey, Andrew, are you going to be excited
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.260]  when we have to do this part again?
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:55.940]  It's okay.
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.200]  I was looking through the camera and
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.760]  we almost went through the windscreen of a car.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:01.500]  Oh, cool.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.280]  That might be a little too low.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.260]  Yeah, well, I was trying to...
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.440]  Eric was like, we gotta go low.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.900]  Yeah, not on the fucking ground.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.880]  I mean, that's low.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.600]  These hills sure are a problem.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.460]  All right.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.000]  That was...
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.580]  We were left, we were right, we were down.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.360]  Down to the right.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.180]  I think I was doing some kegels there.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.460]  I'm so close.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.940]  My pee's going to rocket out.
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.260]  That would have made me feel awful.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:48.260]  How I would have felt would have greatly depended
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.380]  on where we checkpointed.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.760]  Yeah, that's a fair point.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.120]  Did we do it?
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.460]  Is it good?
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.920]  I don't know, he's like...
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.400]  There we go.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.700]  Oh my god, finally.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.400]  That was the setup?
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.580]  Oh my god.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.100]  Let him.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.180]  Bronze, what?
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.520]  Look, just be happy you got a medal.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.680]  Yeah, you passed.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.260]  All right.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.360]  That was another part
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.740]  of the GTA
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.980]  Doomsday Heist.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.400]  We got a lot of the prep done.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.040]  We got missions to go.
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.460]  We're going to start moving through these.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.980]  I cannot wait to get to the actual heist part.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.060]  Reach that finale.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.740]  Have it be another cliff jump that nobody can do.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.440]  Thank you so much for watching.
