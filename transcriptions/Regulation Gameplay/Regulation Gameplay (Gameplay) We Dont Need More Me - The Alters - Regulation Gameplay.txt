[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:01.900 --> 00:03.940]  We are here to check out a game called The Altars.
[00:04.080 --> 00:06.860]  It is a game that I really have enjoyed.
[00:07.080 --> 00:10.600]  And I feel like Gavin and Nick will also, who are alongside with me.
[00:10.940 --> 00:13.680]  Oh, we need to use our scientific minds.
[00:14.040 --> 00:15.980]  Whoa. To get through this scenario.
[00:16.740 --> 00:20.140]  Are we basing our scientific abilities off of the most recent episode
[00:20.140 --> 00:21.920]  where we talked about pasta for 30 minutes?
[00:22.460 --> 00:22.820]  Yeah.
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.560]  Listen, we're high thinkers here.
[00:25.840 --> 00:27.380]  Is this a game about being an altar boy?
[00:27.740 --> 00:29.340]  Oh, it could be.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.680]  I had a friend who was an altar boy and he used to faint constantly.
[00:33.220 --> 00:34.420]  What? Really?
[00:35.100 --> 00:38.280]  I think he used to stand too close to the candles and it would suck all his air away.
[00:41.220 --> 00:46.480]  I thought he was going to be like possessed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:46.700 --> 00:48.280]  Yeah. No, he just used to go down.
[00:48.280 --> 00:49.440]  The candle's taking him out.
[00:49.900 --> 00:52.280]  He didn't stand at rest. You know what I mean?
[00:53.060 --> 00:55.520]  He's getting snuffed up by the pascal candle.
[00:55.940 --> 00:59.460]  This isn't the same friend who had his stomach pumped like five times, was it?
[00:59.460 --> 01:02.800]  No. No, an altar boy wouldn't do that.
[01:04.640 --> 01:06.580]  All its ups and downs.
[01:06.760 --> 01:07.940]  That's us. We're spacemen.
[01:08.120 --> 01:09.460]  Oh, are we Jan?
[01:10.700 --> 01:11.120]  Yeah.
[01:11.480 --> 01:12.000]  That's Feb.
[01:14.220 --> 01:16.900]  But this is we go by Jan.
[01:17.160 --> 01:20.360]  Oh, Jan. Jan Dolski is our name.
[01:20.840 --> 01:23.800]  Who's the who's the best Jan? Jan de Bont?
[01:25.540 --> 01:27.620]  I'm trying to think of other Jans. Yeah.
[01:28.840 --> 01:29.640]  I'm struggling.
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.240]  Yeah, there's a Knux forward named Yannick Hansen, but I don't feel like that counts, but he was real good.
[01:35.300 --> 01:37.000]  I like him. Wouldn't that be with a Y though?
[01:38.400 --> 01:41.700]  No, he's he was a J-A-N-N-I-C-K.
[01:41.840 --> 01:42.140]  Oh.
[01:43.360 --> 01:44.900]  That was that was Yannis.
[01:45.240 --> 01:47.580]  I was about to say Yannis from Goldeneye.
[01:47.880 --> 01:48.220]  Yeah.
[01:48.540 --> 01:48.880]  Yeah.
[01:48.920 --> 01:51.020]  Well, also, I think Myth, but...
[01:51.020 --> 01:51.200]  Yeah.
[01:51.480 --> 01:51.700]  Yeah.
[01:53.840 --> 01:57.600]  Whenever I played the game, I think it was before I saw the film and I just used to call him
[01:57.600 --> 01:59.700]  Janus. Janus?
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.960]  James Bond's just looking for the Janus again.
[02:05.580 --> 02:10.580]  That's how I felt when Eric and Geoff said Sevigny in that content.
[02:11.060 --> 02:15.180]  And I've been saying Sevigny, but I think I was on the right side for once on that one.
[02:16.020 --> 02:16.840]  Not according to Eric.
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.100]  Not according to Eric.
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.620]  Well, Eric's Eric's flawless in all of, I don't think the audience
[02:23.620 --> 02:26.220]  has ever called him out of being wrong at anything that was.
[02:27.010 --> 02:30.320]  I've been thinking of making a compilation called Eric's Always Right.
[02:30.540 --> 02:33.000]  And it's just all the times he was so wrong.
[02:33.460 --> 02:34.440]  That's phenomenal.
[02:35.020 --> 02:39.520]  Do you think that would dip into some of our Pico Park runs?
[02:40.280 --> 02:43.080]  It might. It might delve heavily into this game's pre.
[02:43.500 --> 02:45.500]  Yeah, this game is awesome.
[02:46.500 --> 02:48.640]  So we have crash landed on this planet.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.580]  Is that oil in the sea?
[02:51.400 --> 02:52.680]  It's all rainbow-y.
[02:54.100 --> 02:58.200]  Well, it's just we're on a foreign world, so I don't know.
[02:58.200 --> 03:00.060]  Maybe there could be some oil content, but...
[03:00.860 --> 03:02.820]  Or maybe BP have just started drilling nearby.
[03:06.720 --> 03:12.240]  It made me think of Interstellar, even though like it's not like one to one to any planet.
[03:12.360 --> 03:15.980]  There's just something about it that really made me think of Interstellar.
[03:19.460 --> 03:22.380]  It looks like a good place for a God of War trial.
[03:22.380 --> 03:23.540]  Of some sort. Yeah.
[03:26.860 --> 03:31.520]  So this is on Game Pass, and which is why I kind of stumbled into it.
[03:32.320 --> 03:33.840]  And you just play games.
[03:38.180 --> 03:39.420]  I think it's nice.
[03:39.880 --> 03:40.880]  I think it's great.
[03:41.820 --> 03:42.580]  Yeah, it's really cool.
[03:42.640 --> 03:44.560]  I wish I had more of that interest. I only play games that people tell me to play.
[03:44.820 --> 03:45.300]  Yeah, same.
[03:46.940 --> 03:49.160]  Or ones that interest me in particular.
[03:49.160 --> 03:50.000]  Sorry.
[03:52.760 --> 03:53.500]  Oh, a nice ladder.
[03:54.080 --> 03:55.960]  Gavin, did you get a Switch 2?
[03:56.560 --> 03:56.980]  I did.
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.540]  Did you have you played either Zelda game on it?
[04:03.100 --> 04:08.040]  I booted up Tears of the Kingdom for curiosity's sake.
[04:08.260 --> 04:09.580]  And man, it runs real nice now.
[04:09.900 --> 04:15.260]  Yeah, did it make you feel sick after playing it at 20 FPS on the previous gen?
[04:16.880 --> 04:18.840]  I have heard it's like a completely different game.
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.860]  I also like didn't like playing it docked because.
[04:22.700 --> 04:25.120]  I don't know if it's like the size of my TV.
[04:25.320 --> 04:27.760]  It just I could see every pixel so clearly.
[04:28.080 --> 04:30.520]  And now it's like it actually looks good on my TV.
[04:31.980 --> 04:33.100]  It looks great now.
[04:34.580 --> 04:35.960]  Oh, there's other people. OK.
[04:36.140 --> 04:37.020]  This is a dead crewmate.
[04:37.100 --> 04:39.020]  Yeah. So that's the captain of our crew.
[04:39.060 --> 04:39.580]  They're dead.
[04:40.340 --> 04:43.920]  I like that there's a giant X on the capsule to notify you that it is.
[04:43.940 --> 04:44.940]  Yeah. Great UI.
[04:45.280 --> 04:46.520]  I don't like that.
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.240]  I feel like if even if I was in a pod and there was a big red X on the front,
[04:50.380 --> 04:51.760]  I'd want you to open it and just check.
[04:51.920 --> 04:54.480]  Just check. Just make sure my cable hasn't fallen out.
[04:54.640 --> 04:55.700]  Yeah, maybe the pods broken.
[04:59.120 --> 05:00.520]  Look at the pod and go like,
[05:00.600 --> 05:03.740]  Oh, they weren't approved by America's Got Talent, just move on.
[05:04.960 --> 05:05.800]  Complete mystery.
[05:07.300 --> 05:08.140]  Golden buzzer.
[05:09.100 --> 05:10.640]  Like I see him banging on the base.
[05:11.800 --> 05:13.700]  Oh, yeah, that's cool.
[05:14.840 --> 05:15.420]  It's awesome.
[05:17.800 --> 05:18.860]  You like Ferris wheels?
[05:19.060 --> 05:19.620]  You can hear me.
[05:20.120 --> 05:21.620]  I love a good Ferris wheel.
[05:22.360 --> 05:24.260]  I haven't been on one in a long time, though.
[05:24.300 --> 05:25.620]  I think Ferris wheels are dog shit.
[05:26.860 --> 05:29.720]  They're just it's a little relaxing change of pace.
[05:31.100 --> 05:33.280]  I'm not going to wait in line for a Ferris wheel.
[05:33.500 --> 05:35.260]  No, but if it's available.
[05:36.500 --> 05:37.900]  Go up, look at the sights.
[05:38.180 --> 05:39.060]  Have you been on the London Eye?
[05:39.620 --> 05:40.300]  I haven't.
[05:40.400 --> 05:41.980]  I haven't been to London.
[05:42.240 --> 05:44.240]  Oh, unless it travels.
[05:45.720 --> 05:48.280]  Is that maybe go on tour?
[05:49.040 --> 05:50.400]  Is that an enclosed one, Gavin?
[05:50.560 --> 05:51.600]  Like the cabins are enclosed?
[05:52.280 --> 05:52.420]  Yeah.
[05:53.920 --> 05:54.520]  That's cool.
[05:55.080 --> 05:57.700]  It would be cool to figure out if the London Eye was just rolling
[05:57.700 --> 06:00.680]  and not spinning in place, could it have rolled around the earth yet?
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.000]  It is huge.
[06:03.080 --> 06:03.680]  Oh, fuck.
[06:04.360 --> 06:06.760]  Oh, well, that's the rest of our crew.
[06:07.200 --> 06:08.420]  So is the red flare dead?
[06:09.220 --> 06:11.400]  Or is the flare just whether they're there or not?
[06:11.540 --> 06:13.120]  I think that's where they...
[06:13.120 --> 06:17.720]  I don't think the flare indicates dead, but I think we're like looking at our system now
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.820]  and it's like, yeah, they're all dead.
[06:19.500 --> 06:20.280]  They're all fucked.
[06:22.080 --> 06:22.840]  Oh, man.
[06:23.780 --> 06:27.140]  Why did you need to be in visual range to see that they're all dead?
[06:28.300 --> 06:29.060]  That's a great point.
[06:32.100 --> 06:35.780]  Maybe these cliffs are made out of like Faraday material.
[06:37.280 --> 06:40.560]  Could be a thing where like you look at the pod and you can scan it at a distance.
[06:40.640 --> 06:40.980]  I don't know.
[06:41.040 --> 06:41.900]  Oh, maybe that's possible.
[06:44.180 --> 06:45.520]  A radiation wave?
[06:46.400 --> 06:46.960]  Oh, shit.
[06:47.040 --> 06:49.240]  Yeah, fallout 4, man.
[06:49.400 --> 06:50.400]  Planets are always terrible.
[06:50.900 --> 06:53.260]  New planets, always a pain in the ass.
[06:54.240 --> 06:57.320]  There's never a thing where they go to a new planet and it's just awesome.
[06:58.540 --> 06:59.540]  I think we learned that in Alien.
[07:00.860 --> 07:02.700]  Although at least this planet has paths.
[07:03.680 --> 07:04.240]  That's true.
[07:04.560 --> 07:06.820]  Jagged rock, it'd be a lot more annoying.
[07:10.020 --> 07:11.380]  Got to get to the base.
[07:11.380 --> 07:13.000]  So how did the base get there?
[07:14.760 --> 07:16.180]  So I think it got deployed.
[07:16.440 --> 07:19.420]  Because like, if you look, there's a bunch of like parachutes and stuff around it.
[07:19.460 --> 07:23.360]  Like, I think this is all like an emergency type landing thing.
[07:23.540 --> 07:27.620]  Or we're supposed to land here on purpose, but our pods got fucked up.
[07:28.420 --> 07:30.860]  Always symbolize radiation with chromatic aberration.
[07:36.820 --> 07:39.720]  Is that a use of chromatic aberration you could get behind
[07:39.720 --> 07:41.680]  or is there zero scenarios?
[07:41.820 --> 07:42.680]  I can get behind it there.
[07:43.020 --> 07:44.480]  I just don't want it on the whole time.
[07:45.040 --> 07:45.540]  Yeah, that's fair.
[07:46.600 --> 07:47.000]  But they want.
[07:47.100 --> 07:49.560]  So what's cool is once you go into the pod.
[07:51.120 --> 07:52.760]  Well, what was the save on the two day?
[07:53.660 --> 07:56.240]  I just I've been playing this game a lot and I have so many.
[07:56.400 --> 07:57.540]  I have like 70 saves.
[07:58.020 --> 08:01.000]  Oh, look, fan technology has not advanced very far.
[08:01.720 --> 08:02.680]  Dyson thing right there.
[08:03.080 --> 08:03.960]  No, it hasn't. Yeah.
[08:05.020 --> 08:06.480]  Is that a fan or is that a scanning?
[08:06.740 --> 08:07.420]  I think it's scanning.
[08:07.420 --> 08:08.140]  Oh, OK.
[08:09.540 --> 08:10.340]  Oh yeah, I don't know.
[08:10.960 --> 08:12.080]  It does look like a fan though.
[08:12.280 --> 08:15.700]  What if one of the missions in this game was to change the carbon filter in your Dyson fan?
[08:17.440 --> 08:19.680]  There's a lot of carbon filter changing.
[08:20.820 --> 08:22.240]  There's no Dyson fans.
[08:22.560 --> 08:24.020]  Oh, maybe there'll be DLC.
[08:24.320 --> 08:25.300]  Can anyone hear me?
[08:27.400 --> 08:27.840]  Whoa.
[08:31.520 --> 08:31.960]  Mayday.
[08:32.960 --> 08:35.820]  This just made me think I should make a Mars Attacks game.
[08:37.420 --> 08:37.860]  Yeah.
[08:37.860 --> 08:41.180]  It should be exactly like this, like totally serious.
[08:41.320 --> 08:43.320]  And then the Mars Attacks aliens should be on the screen.
[08:43.420 --> 08:44.640]  And then it just gets goofy.
[08:45.840 --> 08:46.900]  Hello, anyone out there?
[08:46.920 --> 08:47.740]  And they just pop up.
[08:54.520 --> 08:55.000]  4672B.
[08:57.720 --> 09:03.740]  That was a movie that both made me laugh and terrified me as a child.
[09:04.500 --> 09:06.120]  Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.020]  It was the kind of movie where it was like, when I first watched it, it was scary.
[09:09.100 --> 09:10.120]  And then a year later, it was funny.
[09:10.400 --> 09:10.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[09:11.780 --> 09:13.820]  I don't think I've ever watched it in one go.
[09:13.860 --> 09:18.040]  It was like one of those ones that was on TV all of the time for a period.
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.060]  I've seen scenes of it, but yeah, I always found it creepy.
[09:28.550 --> 09:31.750]  They always ran that Kevin Smith movie on Comedy Central, I remember.
[09:31.970 --> 09:32.390]  What was it?
[09:33.710 --> 09:37.170]  The one with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as angels. Dogma, yeah.
[09:37.170 --> 09:42.090]  I think they're making a sequel for that.
[09:42.670 --> 09:43.370]  Oh, yeah.
[09:47.370 --> 09:49.270]  Yeah, it's Dogma. Exactly.
[09:51.510 --> 09:53.570]  He's had the domain for decades now.
[09:53.670 --> 09:54.530]  He's just been waiting.
[09:54.930 --> 09:58.270]  Wait, I think, I think that was all tangled up in Weinstein, wasn't it?
[09:58.290 --> 09:59.850]  That movie. He had to like get it back off him.
[09:59.970 --> 10:00.870]  Yeah, yeah, he did.
[10:07.800 --> 10:11.300]  Because of that, it was one of those weird, this DVD is worth a lot of money.
[10:11.300 --> 10:12.580]  If you have it, yeah.
[10:14.760 --> 10:17.460]  People without of print discs on eBay is nuts.
[10:23.270 --> 10:31.050]  Yeah, I used to collect DVDs and Blu-rays a lot more and I feel like I need to continue that quest more so now.
[10:31.750 --> 10:33.430]  Yeah, I've always been a physical media guy.
[10:34.310 --> 10:35.990]  I don't want my movies getting patched.
[10:38.290 --> 10:43.050]  I gave away 90% of my movie collection.
[10:43.050 --> 10:45.050]  No! Why'd you do that?
[10:46.410 --> 10:48.510]  I just was like, I'm never going to use these again.
[10:48.670 --> 10:49.590]  And I was wrong.
[10:49.950 --> 10:50.810]  I don't, I miss them.
[10:50.970 --> 10:52.670]  I miss having the bonus features.
[10:53.390 --> 10:58.870]  I used to listen to commentary tracks like it was podcasting before podcasts were like, yeah, readily available.
[10:59.090 --> 10:59.730]  I still do. I do the same.
[11:01.170 --> 11:02.690]  I love commentary tracks.
[11:02.830 --> 11:06.310]  In fact, if a Blu-ray or a DVD now doesn't contain them, I'm just like, why?
[11:07.110 --> 11:10.950]  The best commentary tracks are ones that were recorded in the LaserDisc era.
[11:12.270 --> 11:18.050]  Because the actors and the people in the commentary assume that no one would ever listen to them.
[11:18.090 --> 11:19.630]  So they're like completely unhinged.
[11:21.410 --> 11:25.590]  They'll be like, someone come on screen and then like Kurt Russell be like, that one was a bitch.
[11:29.790 --> 11:30.710]  Yeah, that's great.
[11:31.230 --> 11:34.810]  Yeah, then it caught on for a bit and I think they curtailed that a little.
[11:35.270 --> 11:37.250]  Yeah, then they had to start putting...
[11:37.890 --> 11:38.930]  Oh God, what's going on?
[11:39.770 --> 11:40.250]  Whoa!
[11:40.650 --> 11:46.330]  So, the clock on the bottom left, you have up until hour 20 in each day.
[11:46.570 --> 11:46.990]  Oh, okay.
[11:47.170 --> 11:49.550]  Essentially, before you have to head inside.
[11:49.650 --> 11:54.530]  So you're collecting resources to try to save your base.
[11:54.950 --> 11:57.970]  That's a nice way of getting rid of monotony of mining.
[11:58.810 --> 11:59.150]  Yes.
[11:59.690 --> 12:01.210]  So in the bottom right, you see an 8.
[12:01.370 --> 12:06.090]  That is how many days we're away from the sun rising to this side of where we're at.
[12:06.630 --> 12:08.050]  And everything will get melted.
[12:08.050 --> 12:10.610]  Gotta get out of here before sun.
[12:11.050 --> 12:12.210]  I'd love to...
[12:12.210 --> 12:13.450]  I'm going to play this.
[12:14.070 --> 12:16.090]  Yeah, every game that you show me, I want to play.
[12:16.550 --> 12:16.870]  I really like.
[12:18.030 --> 12:19.410]  Okay, so we got to build a workshop.
[12:19.630 --> 12:23.190]  So we go into base building and you go into this screen, which is fucking really cool as well.
[12:23.310 --> 12:24.070]  Now it's fallout shelter.
[12:24.550 --> 12:24.910]  Reorganize.
[12:25.070 --> 12:26.150]  It really is, dude.
[12:26.390 --> 12:27.770]  Immediately hits you with the fallout shelter.
[12:28.190 --> 12:29.450]  So we need a workshop.
[12:30.770 --> 12:32.270]  Throw it onto the...
[12:32.270 --> 12:33.670]  Actually, let's put it there.
[12:33.690 --> 12:35.570]  The difference is you're the one going out to the waste.
[12:36.810 --> 12:38.590]  So craft a scanner.
[12:39.750 --> 12:41.750]  Is one of the modules a shag pad?
[12:43.830 --> 12:44.230]  Maybe.
[12:44.750 --> 12:46.090]  Unlock modules as you play.
[12:46.190 --> 12:47.030]  I haven't got it yet.
[12:47.250 --> 12:47.470]  Wow.
[12:47.750 --> 12:48.410]  Well, you're alone.
[12:48.530 --> 12:49.770]  So do they have a solo shag pad?
[12:51.310 --> 12:51.830]  You know what?
[12:51.950 --> 12:53.110]  They do have a solo shag pad.
[12:53.190 --> 12:55.250]  You might be able to shag the guy who was talking on the screen.
[12:55.890 --> 12:56.590]  Maybe find him.
[12:57.150 --> 12:58.670]  Find an organics depository.
[12:59.630 --> 13:00.730]  What are you going to do in the meantime?
[13:02.130 --> 13:03.950]  Didn't people used to shag manatees?
[13:05.050 --> 13:05.710]  Did they?
[13:07.950 --> 13:09.890]  Did they shag manatees?
[13:11.210 --> 13:11.950]  Is that a thing?
[13:12.970 --> 13:14.170]  Isn't that how the mermaids happened?
[13:15.150 --> 13:16.450]  Yeah, actually, you know what?
[13:16.490 --> 13:17.310]  I'm back on board.
[13:17.490 --> 13:18.570]  That is 100%.
[13:20.290 --> 13:21.850]  Isn't that what the Little Mermaid is about?
[13:22.190 --> 13:23.170]  I don't know if that's a myth.
[13:25.550 --> 13:27.950]  Guys, I don't know if this is a myth, but I heard.
[13:28.510 --> 13:30.690]  I'm just going to Google Snopes manatees.
[13:35.750 --> 13:36.310]  Okay.
[13:37.610 --> 13:38.970]  This is where it gets funky.
[13:39.250 --> 13:41.310]  So this is what BP oil was looking for.
[13:41.410 --> 13:41.870]  Oh, wow.
[13:42.230 --> 13:42.630]  Damn.
[13:43.530 --> 13:48.130]  So we're on this expedition essentially to find this incredibly rare, like
[13:48.130 --> 13:50.030]  theorized, but not discovered.
[13:50.130 --> 13:52.590]  I believe material called rapidium.
[13:53.490 --> 13:54.910]  Better than unobtainium.
[13:55.590 --> 13:56.750]  So much better than...
[13:58.090 --> 13:59.230]  To make you really fast?
[13:59.530 --> 14:00.130]  Extract it.
[14:02.570 --> 14:04.330]  Oh, your time is...
[14:05.330 --> 14:07.050]  Yeah, it chunks.
[14:08.130 --> 14:09.070]  I think we'll have time.
[14:09.190 --> 14:10.910]  So what happens if you run out of...
[14:10.910 --> 14:11.730]  Do you just pass out?
[14:11.890 --> 14:12.290]  Do you die?
[14:12.670 --> 14:14.650]  Yeah, you pass out from exhaustion.
[14:16.050 --> 14:17.090]  Like Stardew Valley.
[14:18.070 --> 14:18.390]  Oh.
[14:19.610 --> 14:22.090]  Although eight o'clock is kind of early to be passing out.
[14:23.470 --> 14:27.650]  So you hit 20 and then you have three hours, but outside it becomes toxic
[14:28.290 --> 14:28.930]  during that time.
[14:28.930 --> 14:32.330]  So it's like if you have activities you need to do in the base, that's sort of
[14:32.330 --> 14:33.030]  the time to do it.
[14:33.130 --> 14:34.290]  However, you'll be tired.
[14:34.710 --> 14:35.710]  So it takes longer.
[14:36.030 --> 14:37.550]  And if you were to do it during...
[14:37.550 --> 14:38.570]  Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[14:39.050 --> 14:40.230]  In a more alert hour.
[14:41.110 --> 14:42.090]  Like me in Vegas.
[14:43.170 --> 14:44.110]  You in Vegas.
[14:45.970 --> 14:48.450]  That's getting pretty tired watching Eric on the horse machine.
[14:50.010 --> 14:52.390]  So what we do is we like lay these out.
[14:54.630 --> 14:57.430]  And then once they're all down,
[14:58.070 --> 15:02.650]  you can see under there and you want to get the red spot in this direction.
[15:03.290 --> 15:04.070]  Holy crap.
[15:05.210 --> 15:07.710]  How do games like this come out without me hearing about it?
[15:08.070 --> 15:10.030]  I just need to.
[15:11.970 --> 15:12.410]  This.
[15:13.970 --> 15:15.150]  Social media was useful.
[15:16.570 --> 15:16.910]  Yeah.
[15:17.690 --> 15:19.270]  I haven't used it in a long time.
[15:19.310 --> 15:21.390]  But man, I just don't hear about anything.
[15:23.770 --> 15:24.650]  So annoying.
[15:24.730 --> 15:25.430]  I'm like right next.
[15:25.530 --> 15:26.050]  There we go.
[15:26.190 --> 15:26.430]  Okay.
[15:26.430 --> 15:30.630]  So once you find like find the meat of it just shows you the whole thing.
[15:30.730 --> 15:31.430]  Find the meat of it.
[15:31.530 --> 15:33.970]  So we have a we have a mining compound.
[15:34.090 --> 15:36.210]  So we put that what the holy shit.
[15:38.130 --> 15:40.590]  And then to actually use it though.
[15:40.610 --> 15:43.690]  You need to put down pylons.
[15:44.050 --> 15:46.670]  So this is actually near but with good graphics.
[15:48.830 --> 15:49.870]  Oh, wait that down.
[15:49.950 --> 15:50.990]  You have go ahead.
[15:51.110 --> 15:52.070]  Does it relay then?
[15:52.130 --> 15:53.010]  Do you have to relay it to the?
[15:53.190 --> 15:53.330]  Yes.
[15:53.390 --> 15:53.690]  Okay.
[15:54.150 --> 15:56.050]  So now was it like a 10 meter cable?
[15:59.750 --> 16:01.490]  Oh, it's just it's awesome.
[16:01.610 --> 16:04.370]  You can see like it very easily like tracks.
[16:04.550 --> 16:06.350]  Look like you're trying to get to the front.
[16:06.590 --> 16:08.230]  So it's like maximizing.
[16:09.370 --> 16:11.870]  Oh, the maximum distance seems to be 45 meters.
[16:11.950 --> 16:15.990]  Yeah, and then there are other types of relays.
[16:16.050 --> 16:16.710]  You eventually can.
[16:17.090 --> 16:18.990]  Yeah, this is awesome.
[16:22.350 --> 16:23.910]  Keep on moving.
[16:24.530 --> 16:25.610]  There is so excited for you guys.
[16:25.610 --> 16:27.630]  You haven't even really seen the hook of this game yet.
[16:27.730 --> 16:29.870]  And it's so cool.
[16:31.570 --> 16:35.450]  Yes, we have to have 180 organic Mather gathered using the outpost.
[16:35.570 --> 16:38.850]  Oh, and I hope that when he turns when he turns 33, he dies.
[16:41.850 --> 16:43.950]  Yeah, we got to fight the Patriots at the end of this.
[16:43.970 --> 16:44.690]  It's the last boss.
[16:45.330 --> 16:49.450]  What's cool is once you link up one of those they become a fast travel point.
[16:49.630 --> 16:50.530]  Oh, that's nice.
[16:50.930 --> 16:52.090]  That's very nice post.
[16:52.570 --> 16:52.970]  Wow.
[16:53.730 --> 16:56.850]  Now, let's use the remaining time we have to do some mining.
[16:57.050 --> 16:57.790]  Is that instantaneous?
[16:57.810 --> 16:59.170]  Then you don't lose time in that.
[17:00.050 --> 17:02.090]  No, you don't lose time on the fast travel.
[17:02.330 --> 17:02.770]  Interesting.
[17:05.530 --> 17:10.450]  It's like this game kind of has like Death Stranding vibes to me and just the look of it.
[17:10.490 --> 17:14.230]  But it stopped right before it went so far up its ass.
[17:14.350 --> 17:15.830]  I couldn't play it.
[17:17.490 --> 17:22.630]  I really enjoy the like delivering stuff to people mechanic at Death Stranding.
[17:22.630 --> 17:23.650]  But I understand that.
[17:23.790 --> 17:24.710]  That's like I'm a sicko.
[17:25.670 --> 17:29.410]  I got so much joy of like getting all the outposts connected.
[17:29.690 --> 17:30.670]  I just need to try it again.
[17:30.850 --> 17:31.410]  If we can, I think.
[17:33.610 --> 17:34.270]  Anyone copy?
[17:40.140 --> 17:44.300]  I went out to find resources and I found a cave full of something.
[17:44.840 --> 17:47.660]  This is like the reception I used to have at the last place I lived.
[17:48.460 --> 17:49.240]  Absolute nightmare.
[17:51.180 --> 17:54.620]  Walking around my apartment trying to find any place with signal.
[17:54.700 --> 17:54.980]  You hear me?
[17:54.980 --> 17:56.440]  Yeah, I've never got reception.
[17:56.940 --> 17:58.360]  I think I found rapidium.
[18:00.800 --> 18:02.320]  You sure about that?
[18:02.540 --> 18:03.320]  Oh, I'm sure.
[18:03.460 --> 18:03.640]  What?
[18:03.820 --> 18:04.200]  I'm certain.
[18:04.680 --> 18:05.320]  I'm sure.
[18:05.380 --> 18:09.500]  I feel like you'd be really good Gavin at naming a made up material.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.480]  I'd love to see your version of like you in the pitch room.
[18:21.230 --> 18:23.950]  You want me to build a womb?
[18:24.370 --> 18:24.510]  What?
[18:24.810 --> 18:25.950]  It is Death Stranding.
[18:26.270 --> 18:26.690]  Oh, yeah.
[18:28.750 --> 18:29.910]  Where's my baby in a bottle?
[18:32.030 --> 18:33.550]  Has he found enough loomium?
[18:34.990 --> 18:35.990]  Oh, loom!
[18:35.990 --> 18:37.390]  Oh, see? He's in charge.
[18:39.170 --> 18:42.930]  Okay, so let's go build a womb.
[18:44.550 --> 18:45.630]  A womb room?
[18:47.130 --> 18:47.770]  The womb.
[18:48.430 --> 18:50.050]  So it speeds up growing?
[18:50.810 --> 18:51.150]  Is that what he said?
[18:52.750 --> 18:53.550]  You'll see.
[18:53.990 --> 18:54.950]  Oh, you can...
[18:54.950 --> 18:55.730]  So let's...
[18:55.730 --> 18:57.550]  I'm just gonna adjust this to the way I like.
[18:57.550 --> 18:59.030]  You can move stuff around?
[18:59.630 --> 19:02.350]  Yeah, you can completely design it however you want.
[19:02.410 --> 19:03.730]  The only thing you can't move is this.
[19:04.810 --> 19:07.230]  I've noticed that you're a big adjustments guy.
[19:08.670 --> 19:09.550]  I just...
[19:09.550 --> 19:11.990]  I need to get things in the place that I like them.
[19:12.030 --> 19:12.710]  So here's our womb.
[19:13.530 --> 19:16.090]  So now we can test our rapidium to confirm that.
[19:17.630 --> 19:20.110]  And Fallout Shelter must have driven you crazy at first.
[19:23.470 --> 19:23.910]  Oh!
[19:26.150 --> 19:26.670]  Oh!
[19:27.390 --> 19:27.910]  Dolly!
[19:35.840 --> 19:36.700]  Hell yeah!
[19:37.180 --> 19:38.440]  Where did you get the DNA from?
[19:39.860 --> 19:46.160]  So essentially, rapidium is this material that you can craft beings out of, I guess.
[19:47.100 --> 19:47.300]  What?
[19:47.780 --> 19:49.240]  But how did you get the being?
[19:50.660 --> 19:55.860]  So I think it was like a part of the DNA sample from the people that we're talking to.
[19:55.860 --> 20:03.920]  I think they essentially sent us like a blueprint of sorts of testing to see if we're able to create a genetic thing.
[20:07.260 --> 20:07.740]  Wow!
[20:08.760 --> 20:10.460]  We got a sheep now named Molly.
[20:11.860 --> 20:12.120]  Okay.
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.920]  Well, it's no manatee, but I'm sure you could give it a go.
[20:16.440 --> 20:18.000]  Or get there, okay?
[20:18.080 --> 20:21.360]  You got a starter animal and then you build to the manatees.
[20:21.620 --> 20:22.680]  Not that type of womb room.
[20:23.380 --> 20:24.860]  Surprising, but it worked, I think.
[20:25.540 --> 20:28.260]  Can you grow Mads Mikkelsen?
[20:33.000 --> 20:38.260]  Yeah, you have to grow Mads Mikkelsen and then Agent 47 and have to try to make them live together peacefully.
[20:41.440 --> 20:45.860]  I do really appreciate that you can pet the sheep and there's an achievement for petting the sheep.
[20:45.980 --> 20:46.420]  Hell yeah!
[20:46.660 --> 20:47.160]  That's nice.
[20:48.380 --> 20:51.640]  There's an achievement in Red Dead 2 for petting all the dogs, I think.
[20:51.640 --> 20:52.540]  Is there?
[20:52.760 --> 20:54.500]  I think maybe I'm thinking of a different...
[20:54.500 --> 20:55.440]  Oh, I might be thinking of...
[20:56.300 --> 21:00.320]  I did that in Blueprints whenever I built the room with the dogs.
[21:00.380 --> 21:01.780]  I'd always pet one dog on the way through.
[21:01.820 --> 21:02.420]  Oh, absolutely.
[21:02.720 --> 21:03.160]  You have to.
[21:07.140 --> 21:11.500]  Speaking of the Vegas thing earlier, there was a moment the first night we were there, Andrew.
[21:12.120 --> 21:16.300]  We were having a late dinner and everyone was like, oh, I'm so tired.
[21:16.380 --> 21:18.980]  And Gavin was like, oh, that must be so hard for all of you.
[21:21.920 --> 21:27.420]  We were all just like stuffing our faces with steak and I looked at my watch and it was like 5.30 a.m. for me.
[21:28.080 --> 21:29.020]  The jet lag.
[21:32.180 --> 21:34.820]  We're all like, oh, I can't, we're staying up so late to eat this.
[21:34.920 --> 21:36.120]  And Gavin's like, oh, hmm.
[21:36.900 --> 21:39.080]  Day three sunrise in seven days.
[21:40.860 --> 21:42.440]  We gotta get some more organic matter.
[21:42.800 --> 21:44.820]  Did you co-op the captain's cabin for yourself?
[21:45.820 --> 21:46.240]  Sure did.
[21:46.360 --> 21:46.580]  Alright.
[21:47.280 --> 21:48.320]  I mean, you would, wouldn't you?
[21:48.420 --> 21:48.940]  You wouldn't just...
[21:50.040 --> 21:50.780]  leave it empty.
[21:51.140 --> 21:51.480]  That's fair.
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.020]  So you can't even be in the base when the sun comes up?
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.700]  No, no, everything dies.
[22:01.720 --> 22:02.940]  So we got to get out of here.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.980]  We got to get moving before sunrise.
[22:05.580 --> 22:07.780]  Can you just roll the base away like a big wheel?
[22:09.280 --> 22:10.740]  Yep, literally what we're doing.
[22:11.620 --> 22:15.600]  Oh, so you're just continuing to roll it into the shady side of the planet?
[22:16.680 --> 22:21.260]  Yeah, so we're trying to essentially just get time until we can get evacuated from this planet.
[22:22.740 --> 22:24.100]  So we need to build a kitchen.
[22:24.500 --> 22:25.180]  There's the Starcraft element.
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.520]  Can you grow a room full of potatoes?
[22:29.360 --> 22:30.240]  I wish.
[22:30.780 --> 22:32.480]  Just lean real Martian style?
[22:32.660 --> 22:32.840]  Yeah.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.900]  You can build like, it's carrots is like the thing it spliced.
[22:37.020 --> 22:38.600]  But yeah, it's essentially like potatoes and stuff.
[22:39.460 --> 22:41.460]  Okay, so we got to prepare six mush meals.
[22:41.600 --> 22:42.960]  We need to eat mush meal.
[22:43.280 --> 22:44.060]  I need to read that book.
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.700]  Yeah, I have never read the book.
[22:49.160 --> 22:49.900]  Fun movie though.
[22:50.960 --> 22:52.040]  2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[22:52.040 --> 22:54.140]  I started the audiobook of it.
[22:54.440 --> 22:55.100]  Oh, did you?
[22:55.760 --> 22:56.240]  Good audiobook?
[22:57.540 --> 22:59.340]  I just struggle with audiobooks.
[22:59.440 --> 22:59.860]  I do too.
[23:00.140 --> 23:00.400]  Sure.
[23:02.120 --> 23:04.500]  What made you go audiobook instead of regular book?
[23:06.660 --> 23:08.300]  Just lazy schmuck.
[23:12.940 --> 23:14.720]  Okay, time to roll on out of here.
[23:15.000 --> 23:15.460]  Bear, oh!
[23:15.680 --> 23:15.720]  That's engine.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.220]  Oh, you can do it this quickly.
[23:18.320 --> 23:18.760]  I didn't realize.
[23:19.260 --> 23:19.420]  Uh-oh.
[23:19.420 --> 23:21.060]  Engine, lever, machinery.
[23:24.280 --> 23:26.320]  Stuff's always fucking breaking around here.
[23:31.880 --> 23:33.500]  It's the old Dyson reboot wheel.
[23:34.540 --> 23:35.480]  Old Dyson reboot.
[23:36.640 --> 23:37.140]  Ah!
[23:37.800 --> 23:38.360]  What?
[23:39.420 --> 23:40.440]  Broken again.
[23:41.240 --> 23:44.720]  So is this normally what happens in this point?
[23:44.840 --> 23:46.100]  Or is this kind of random?
[23:46.280 --> 23:46.480]  Okay.
[23:46.820 --> 23:46.840]  Yes, yes.
[23:47.000 --> 23:47.660]  Good God.
[23:47.840 --> 23:48.360]  Now it's fucking broken.
[23:49.720 --> 23:51.560]  You have got to be kidding me.
[23:51.700 --> 23:51.940]  Okay.
[23:53.520 --> 23:56.540]  Just my luck to be stuck in a junkyard.
[23:59.580 --> 24:00.540]  So, uh...
[24:00.540 --> 24:01.260]  Hey, people.
[24:01.860 --> 24:02.800]  We're fucked.
[24:03.840 --> 24:05.460]  Hey, you still there?
[24:06.100 --> 24:07.360]  I really need your help.
[24:07.440 --> 24:08.380]  I can't get out of here.
[24:09.200 --> 24:13.240]  I did everything according to the manual, but there's a malfunction.
[24:13.480 --> 24:14.600]  I can't fix it.
[24:14.600 --> 24:16.140]  I've tried turning it on and off.
[24:16.260 --> 24:17.440]  There's nothing else I can do.
[24:19.520 --> 24:21.660]  Oh, grow a new Dyson reboot wheel?
[24:24.960 --> 24:27.840]  Only the captain has access codes.
[24:27.920 --> 24:29.160]  Ooh, the quantum computer.
[24:29.900 --> 24:30.320]  Yes.
[24:30.440 --> 24:31.120]  The old QC.
[24:31.680 --> 24:33.260]  The old QC.
[24:34.840 --> 24:37.280]  Okay, so now we have access to the computers.
[24:37.440 --> 24:38.540]  Let's go check out that.
[24:39.700 --> 24:40.780]  You go to the quantum realm?
[24:41.920 --> 24:42.620]  Sort of.
[24:43.620 --> 24:44.820]  What about the quantum of solace?
[24:48.680 --> 24:50.440]  Really wanted to like that movie.
[24:50.840 --> 24:51.600]  What is this?
[24:51.600 --> 24:53.240]  You mean Spectre with a stupid name?
[24:53.700 --> 24:53.880]  Yeah.
[24:57.300 --> 24:58.020]  Well, that's right.
[24:58.080 --> 24:59.460]  They did just call it quantum, didn't they?
[25:00.120 --> 25:01.960]  Well, they just didn't have the rights to Spectre anymore.
[25:02.060 --> 25:03.440]  And then they got them back later, I think.
[25:04.040 --> 25:05.800]  So that retroactively...
[25:05.800 --> 25:07.140]  So then they just made Spectre.
[25:11.990 --> 25:13.610]  Going into our mind records.
[25:14.490 --> 25:15.770]  Is that your brain hole?
[25:17.050 --> 25:17.630]  Sort of.
[25:17.770 --> 25:18.970]  Our mind records?
[25:22.820 --> 25:24.040]  I recognize this.
[25:33.290 --> 25:34.650]  This is where the narrative comes in.
[25:34.730 --> 25:36.650]  And I think it's such a cool way to display it.
[25:36.790 --> 25:40.610]  Essentially, these are all the key moments in your life.
[25:40.670 --> 25:40.870]  Yeah.
[25:41.850 --> 25:43.850]  So like childhood memories.
[25:45.270 --> 25:48.030]  Growing up, you have sort of an abusive family.
[25:48.830 --> 25:50.050]  Go to losing your virginity.
[25:50.710 --> 25:51.170]  Oh, yeah.
[25:51.270 --> 25:51.410]  Let's see.
[25:52.990 --> 25:54.190]  It's not 16.
[25:55.330 --> 25:56.290]  Not 19.
[25:58.710 --> 26:00.050]  We're leaving at 19.
[26:01.210 --> 26:02.130]  There we go.
[26:02.130 --> 26:03.150]  What? 21.
[26:04.950 --> 26:05.710]  Nailed it.
[26:07.130 --> 26:09.990]  But yeah, it's this really cool thing where like you can really...
[26:09.990 --> 26:15.650]  Taking your time and reading and seeing sort of the path that got you to the position that you're currently in.
[26:16.330 --> 26:18.270]  And this is all Qubit level 1.
[26:19.690 --> 26:20.130]  Yes.
[26:20.510 --> 26:22.030]  This is Qubit 1.
[26:23.250 --> 26:23.930]  A dream house.
[26:24.030 --> 26:27.950]  Learning about the relationship you're in, where things go wrong, choices you made.
[26:28.390 --> 26:30.030]  Ah, I'd love to see my life in...
[26:30.970 --> 26:31.470]  Really cool.
[26:31.470 --> 26:32.570]  Strand format.
[26:34.850 --> 26:37.370]  And then you join Project Dolly.
[26:37.890 --> 26:38.330]  35.
[26:40.210 --> 26:42.770]  Enter the spaceship with the tingling of anxiety and excitement.
[26:42.950 --> 26:44.050]  You're going to space!
[26:45.030 --> 26:46.090]  Things don't go well.
[26:46.530 --> 26:49.570]  I'm at the age now where a lot of video game characters are...
[26:51.110 --> 26:51.550]  Younger?
[26:51.750 --> 26:51.930]  Younger.
[26:52.230 --> 26:52.430]  Yeah.
[26:52.710 --> 26:55.390]  That's gonna suck.
[26:55.530 --> 26:57.470]  Read about like the mayor of New York being younger.
[26:57.610 --> 26:58.110]  I'm like, oh man.
[26:59.090 --> 26:59.570]  Oh, yeah.
[26:59.970 --> 27:00.050]  That's crazy.
[27:00.330 --> 27:00.830]  That's crazy.
[27:00.830 --> 27:01.810]  That's a lot of responsibility.
[27:03.170 --> 27:05.790]  I could be the mayor of a street.
[27:07.150 --> 27:13.050]  I'm also at that age where a lot of you look at athletes and you're like, they're over the hill.
[27:14.710 --> 27:16.210]  But like 10 years younger than you.
[27:16.430 --> 27:16.850]  Yeah, exactly.
[27:19.970 --> 27:21.270]  I'm like, I bet I could do that.
[27:21.310 --> 27:23.730]  And I was like, that wouldn't last 10 seconds out what they're doing.
[27:23.730 --> 27:25.330]  I want answers.
[27:28.520 --> 27:32.820]  So this is the thing where we didn't disclose to them having any of that information.
[27:33.240 --> 27:38.760]  So learning that this corporate giant that we're working for somehow has this.
[27:39.040 --> 27:39.360]  Oh!
[27:39.680 --> 27:40.180]  Is fucked.
[27:40.700 --> 27:44.040]  Like we didn't know that that existed and that they had that info in any capacity.
[27:44.920 --> 27:45.300]  Damn.
[27:49.360 --> 27:50.640]  Who made this?
[27:52.680 --> 27:54.100]  I'm blanking on the studio.
[27:55.100 --> 27:56.640]  You're gonna stop branching?
[27:57.920 --> 27:58.540]  Sort of.
[28:02.520 --> 28:03.340]  Eleven man studio.
[28:11.500 --> 28:23.860]  Boy, I tell you what, now that you mention it, I have seen the game art for this and it did not tell you shit about this game.
[28:23.860 --> 28:25.180]  You're not suggesting.
[28:25.380 --> 28:27.260]  No, it's very like kind of goofy.
[28:27.400 --> 28:29.840]  Use rapidium to create a.
[28:32.100 --> 28:34.620]  Someone to alter their mind.
[28:35.680 --> 28:37.580]  Not what you're saying, right?
[28:39.980 --> 28:41.480]  What did you just?
[28:42.260 --> 28:44.340]  He's trying to post a photo of the cover.
[28:44.980 --> 28:46.240]  Yeah, there you go.
[28:46.340 --> 28:47.080]  That's what it looks like.
[28:49.280 --> 28:49.480]  What?
[28:51.440 --> 28:53.520]  Yeah, you're about to see that coming to play.
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.440]  It looks like the real world or something.
[28:55.640 --> 28:57.420]  Looks like if Corridor Crew made a movie.
[28:57.520 --> 29:00.060]  So we gotta initiate the branching procedure.
[29:02.200 --> 29:02.980]  This is.
[29:05.260 --> 29:05.940]  So.
[29:07.220 --> 29:10.620]  So essentially how branching works is the quantum computer.
[29:10.860 --> 29:11.280]  Oh, Netflix.
[29:11.520 --> 29:19.680]  Goes through like different dimension type shit and it is picking different paths of your life path.
[29:19.680 --> 29:24.660]  So from like important moments where yes, different choices could have been made.
[29:25.580 --> 29:25.900]  Exactly.
[29:26.280 --> 29:29.980]  And you became a different person because of that with a different skill set.
[29:30.620 --> 29:31.140]  See for you.
[29:31.200 --> 29:32.900]  It would have been that you kicked the child.
[29:33.640 --> 29:36.400]  Yeah, it's all of my life would have been different.
[29:37.160 --> 29:39.100]  This is definitely the ideal path.
[29:39.200 --> 29:40.480]  So our shit is broken.
[29:40.580 --> 29:43.900]  So we need the technician separation.
[29:44.720 --> 29:50.640]  So you're just going to become someone who knows about technology previously?
[29:52.100 --> 29:52.720]  No.
[29:54.380 --> 29:55.160]  Are you?
[29:55.220 --> 30:00.440]  So that was a branching point where instead of confronting my abusive father,
[30:00.560 --> 30:01.540]  I just left for college.
[30:01.540 --> 30:06.260]  And this is the path of if I were to have confronted and stayed with my mom.
[30:06.560 --> 30:10.300]  So you're altering your yourself completely?
[30:10.520 --> 30:11.680]  Not altering myself.
[30:11.680 --> 30:17.720]  These are like all of the different variations or some of the variations that I could have been.
[30:18.260 --> 30:20.260]  But you still get access to those abilities?
[30:21.280 --> 30:23.960]  No, we're crafting a new person.
[30:24.180 --> 30:29.560]  Oh, oh, we're growing a person in the womb who is me.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.980]  If they made different life choices and thus have different.
[30:33.440 --> 30:34.400]  That's nuts.
[30:34.560 --> 30:35.740]  So is there going to be two yous?
[30:36.480 --> 30:38.980]  Yes, that is like it's like moon.
[30:39.860 --> 30:40.640]  Sort of.
[30:40.680 --> 30:40.880]  Yeah.
[30:41.240 --> 30:41.920]  Oh, I get it.
[30:41.960 --> 30:43.480]  These are all the same dude in this picture.
[30:43.540 --> 30:44.180]  Now, I see it.
[30:44.300 --> 30:44.540]  Yes.
[30:45.560 --> 30:47.240]  Those are all different alters.
[30:47.400 --> 30:47.880]  Holy.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.660]  Oh, well, that's that's an option for the shag room.
[30:53.260 --> 30:54.600]  It's just me.
[30:57.120 --> 30:58.340]  Am I into me?
[30:58.480 --> 30:59.080]  I guess.
[30:59.120 --> 30:59.580]  I don't know.
[31:00.220 --> 31:01.980]  An orgy with like six youth.
[31:04.460 --> 31:06.420]  Who gets the captain's bed?
[31:08.280 --> 31:10.240]  That becomes a problem very quickly.
[31:11.280 --> 31:12.480]  We'll deal with that.
[31:13.620 --> 31:15.260]  Now, there's so many dilemmas.
[31:15.960 --> 31:16.680]  There's a lot.
[31:17.700 --> 31:18.180]  Yep.
[31:19.120 --> 31:23.340]  Like the original one versus the new one being any less of the original.
[31:24.800 --> 31:27.120]  Is he thinking about how he can kill him if this goes wrong?
[31:28.920 --> 31:29.940]  Would that be committing?
[31:30.520 --> 31:31.320]  I think a more just terrified character.
[31:31.480 --> 31:32.160]  Would that be suicide?
[31:32.780 --> 31:34.560]  Oh, I don't know.
[31:35.720 --> 31:36.700]  Wake up the other one.
[31:37.240 --> 31:38.400]  Wake up the other me.
[31:40.900 --> 31:42.840]  Oh, he woke up clothed.
[31:42.880 --> 31:43.560]  That's awesome.
[31:51.280 --> 31:52.840]  What's this dolly on his thing?
[31:54.720 --> 31:54.900]  Hello.
[31:55.280 --> 31:55.540]  Hello.
[31:55.820 --> 31:57.060]  Can you hear me?
[32:02.810 --> 32:03.910]  What is this?
[32:11.060 --> 32:12.840]  The where am I?
[32:14.380 --> 32:20.640]  Do they all look the same or sometimes do they be like, oh, I had a car accident when I was 25.
[32:21.980 --> 32:24.800]  I have spawned in an altar that is missing an arm.
[32:24.800 --> 32:26.540]  Well, it becomes part of it.
[32:26.540 --> 32:26.860]  Wow.
[32:27.440 --> 32:29.620]  You're in a lab inside.
[32:30.060 --> 32:40.120]  So this is where it becomes a juggling act of you create altars and thus makes you able to be more efficient in what tasks you can do within the time limit.
[32:40.400 --> 32:45.900]  However, you have to navigate like their different personalities and prevent mutinies.
[32:45.980 --> 32:49.140]  And it's like, oh, my God, social dynamics.
[32:50.240 --> 32:53.420]  First off, the ramifications of what is happening in this.
[32:53.420 --> 32:55.480]  Yeah, yes, very frightening.
[32:55.760 --> 32:59.820]  But I'm like, so can they both be out doing stuff in the same day?
[33:00.220 --> 33:01.380]  You're on some meds.
[33:01.460 --> 33:01.820]  Yes.
[33:02.160 --> 33:06.100]  So you have specific if I wanted to, I could assign him to the drill.
[33:06.100 --> 33:11.120]  So, you know, while I did something else, but he's going to have a natural perk set.
[33:11.280 --> 33:15.500]  So for him, he is 50% more efficient at doing repairs around.
[33:15.760 --> 33:16.920]  He's going to take a set.
[33:17.220 --> 33:17.620]  Check your mental.
[33:17.880 --> 33:18.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[33:19.520 --> 33:23.100]  Do you think you can think you think Molly's real?
[33:23.420 --> 33:25.300]  All right, we're in the perks.
[33:27.860 --> 33:29.800]  You got to be careful on those.
[33:30.060 --> 33:32.240]  OK, my name is Yon Dolski.
[33:35.040 --> 33:39.440]  Yeah, so it becomes an interesting thing where when you're like talking to these characters,
[33:39.440 --> 33:45.260]  I'm thinking about like what they would want to hear more so than like what I think is necessarily
[33:45.260 --> 33:48.600]  this to them trying to keep everybody happy to them.
[33:48.700 --> 33:50.520]  Have they lived their whole life up to this point?
[33:51.240 --> 33:53.180]  They have all the memories to that point.
[33:53.180 --> 33:53.640]  All right.
[33:54.460 --> 33:55.900]  I am a senior technician.
[33:56.140 --> 33:58.940]  So how did they get me what your role is to them?
[33:59.020 --> 33:59.880]  How did they get here?
[33:59.940 --> 34:03.580]  Crew members, just some kind of they're trying to figure that out.
[34:03.660 --> 34:06.480]  OK, they don't, I think, understand that they were just grown in a lab.
[34:06.480 --> 34:07.380]  There is a process.
[34:07.660 --> 34:10.980]  So the last thing they remember is different.
[34:11.280 --> 34:15.240]  The last thing they remember is like signing up, I guess, to go on the dolly operation,
[34:15.400 --> 34:16.740]  like whatever your last memory is.
[34:16.980 --> 34:19.400]  Oh, God, what's the experiment?
[34:20.020 --> 34:21.020]  So like different.
[34:21.200 --> 34:24.460]  These are all people are used that took different life paths,
[34:24.560 --> 34:26.440]  but you all ended up in the same position.
[34:26.680 --> 34:29.980]  I needed someone all the same last memory because it got broken.
[34:31.420 --> 34:32.840]  Then, OK, this is the crazy part.
[34:32.980 --> 34:37.020]  I learned that there's this functionality of the quantum computer.
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.520]  Is he revealing to him that he's a clone essentially here?
[34:41.720 --> 34:42.220]  Sort of.
[34:42.260 --> 34:43.720]  Yeah, versions of a person's life.
[34:43.720 --> 34:47.940]  I feel like that would undo a lot of ability very quickly.
[34:48.300 --> 34:51.240]  I feel like I could be convinced that you're a clone.
[34:51.760 --> 34:53.480]  Yeah, that just I wasn't the original.
[34:53.940 --> 34:54.740]  Would you want to be?
[34:57.060 --> 34:58.200]  That's an interesting question.
[34:58.600 --> 34:59.640]  I don't know if I care.
[35:02.760 --> 35:06.240]  Like if I just woke up one day and me was telling me what to do, I'd be like, yeah, right.
[35:07.200 --> 35:09.200]  I think I would need a day to process.
[35:09.520 --> 35:10.640]  And then after that, it would be.
[35:10.800 --> 35:13.640]  Yeah, like, OK, well, I guess this is how it is.
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.160]  If I woke up to me and he was telling me what to do.
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.920]  I'd be like, well, that's a more assertive me.
[35:25.040 --> 35:25.920]  So I'll just do what he says.
[35:27.680 --> 35:29.080]  Oh, that's an interesting thought.
[35:30.300 --> 35:32.000]  An assertive me takes control.
[35:33.220 --> 35:34.220]  He said we were stranded.
[35:35.260 --> 35:35.560]  Yes.
[35:36.780 --> 35:39.920]  So are you learning things about him when it says less whatever?
[35:41.140 --> 35:46.180]  You're kind of getting a read of like their personality and what type of thing they would want to hear or not want to hear.
[35:46.940 --> 35:58.360]  So, OK, so essentially you're trying to keep them happy to the best of your ability, because if they become unhappy, they will work less as well as threatening with me woke me.
[35:58.460 --> 36:00.460]  I mean, that is a way for if they win mutiny.
[36:00.680 --> 36:01.680]  Can you just be them?
[36:03.120 --> 36:04.680]  No, you're still dying.
[36:04.860 --> 36:05.480]  Games over.
[36:05.500 --> 36:08.660]  OK, if the load is saved to a previous day.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.380]  So the original you is really the only important one.
[36:12.420 --> 36:12.720]  Yes.
[36:13.440 --> 36:13.840]  Exist.
[36:14.120 --> 36:14.380]  Jeez.
[36:15.240 --> 36:16.560]  That's how the Clone Wars started.
[36:16.760 --> 36:17.680]  So you want to phrase it?
[36:17.840 --> 36:19.700]  Well, like, could you kill a clone and the game doesn't end?
[36:21.020 --> 36:21.420]  Yes.
[36:21.700 --> 36:22.040]  OK.
[36:25.040 --> 36:27.500]  Well, I would I've never done that.
[36:27.600 --> 36:29.140]  But theoretically, yes.
[36:29.160 --> 36:31.300]  Like there's wording that implies to me that.
[36:31.520 --> 36:32.060]  Yeah, you can.
[36:32.580 --> 36:32.980]  Wow.
[36:34.820 --> 36:39.380]  I feel like I would work in some sort of system where we all take turns in the captain's bed.
[36:39.420 --> 36:40.640]  And when you try and keep it all equal.
[36:41.220 --> 36:42.420]  This is a lot.
[36:42.600 --> 36:46.200]  Yeah, you can't do that thing where you create a clone to do all the hard labor.
[36:46.380 --> 36:49.360]  Trust me and then not take any action in it yourself.
[36:49.500 --> 36:50.980]  In a very bad way.
[36:51.220 --> 36:53.300]  And you'll know that's how they turn to understand this.
[36:53.320 --> 36:54.360]  But that is how they turn.
[36:54.580 --> 36:58.680]  There would be some people who would like get a new clone and be like, all right, do this or I'll shoot you in the back of the head.
[37:01.380 --> 37:03.460]  I don't like this kind of pressure.
[37:04.920 --> 37:05.240]  Well.
[37:06.480 --> 37:07.620]  Oh, that makes two.
[37:07.680 --> 37:08.680]  So you never want to see rebellion.
[37:09.160 --> 37:09.520]  Fine.
[37:09.520 --> 37:10.940]  Oh shit, that led to two.
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.120]  Two rebellions.
[37:13.100 --> 37:15.220]  So you're just having rebellious thoughts?
[37:16.140 --> 37:16.420]  Yes.
[37:21.690 --> 37:24.230]  This is us not creating a new shared memory.
[37:42.810 --> 37:51.210]  The credits are very funny for this game because it's just Yandelsky, Yandelsky, Yandelsky, Yandelsky, Yandelsky over and over again in the same voice actor.
[37:54.260 --> 37:55.150]  Is it a long game?
[37:59.730 --> 38:03.170]  It's probably like under 12 hours, I'd say.
[38:03.510 --> 38:07.610]  However, I played completely wrong my first go through.
[38:07.850 --> 38:10.930]  And so now in a second one with the information I have.
[38:11.730 --> 38:19.450]  Uh, I kind of hit like a point in which I couldn't continue because I just played poorly as someone who doesn't play a lot of survival games.
[38:21.970 --> 38:25.750]  Can you get the new altar to just make another quantum computer?
[38:27.370 --> 38:29.810]  No, I've just not been able to do that.
[38:29.950 --> 38:33.390]  And have just like a multiplier of altars getting made?
[38:34.710 --> 38:35.730]  You do have a limit.
[38:35.890 --> 38:39.170]  So if you go, let's see, where's my quantum up here?
[38:39.710 --> 38:40.430]  Where's my quantum?
[38:41.910 --> 38:42.270]  So...
[38:43.470 --> 38:47.070]  In the bottom left, the available slots is how many altars you can make.
[38:48.250 --> 38:49.670]  Okay, you start with just three.
[38:49.750 --> 38:53.730]  And so it's got, uh, yeah, a maximum of three until you can upgrade it.
[38:53.750 --> 38:54.190]  But it's cool.
[38:54.270 --> 38:55.050]  Like you can go.
[38:56.050 --> 38:58.210]  I'm not going to focus on this, but you can like read it.
[38:58.310 --> 38:59.170]  I would highly recommend it.
[38:59.210 --> 39:02.710]  It's really cool with the narrative stuff and then seeing like how the branching worked.
[39:02.970 --> 39:07.670]  And do they ever, outside of now, do they ever come back to the same point?
[39:09.170 --> 39:11.630]  Do they ever like merge with the previous branch and back out?
[39:12.550 --> 39:13.610]  I don't think so.
[39:14.210 --> 39:16.030]  Can they branch from the other branches?
[39:18.730 --> 39:19.790]  Sort of, yeah.
[39:19.910 --> 39:20.090]  Okay.
[39:22.090 --> 39:24.850]  Yeah, yeah, they branch as it expands.
[39:25.630 --> 39:26.610]  There are all sorts of things.
[39:26.670 --> 39:28.070]  I'm just going to grab something really quick.
[39:28.870 --> 39:29.270]  This is...
[39:29.270 --> 39:30.670]  I'm here so you can like explore.
[39:31.010 --> 39:32.230]  Such a clever idea for a game.
[39:32.250 --> 39:32.710]  You have seven...
[39:32.710 --> 39:36.170]  Yeah, all the mechanics and the narrative drive is so good.
[39:37.030 --> 39:37.450]  Hold on.
[39:37.710 --> 39:38.650]  So we have seven days.
[39:38.650 --> 39:44.970]  So typically if I was doing this in a way that I'd like actually be building and want to be collecting resources to get ready for the trip.
[39:46.110 --> 39:52.010]  But our ship has dropped cargo as part of the evac that like everybody brought with them.
[39:52.310 --> 39:57.870]  Oh, it's like these are items that you can give to the altars that like they have memories for and it boosts their mood.
[39:58.230 --> 40:05.030]  But there's also these movies by I'm guessing a channel called Chris and Jack and they're just live-action short films.
[40:05.230 --> 40:05.470]  What?
[40:05.950 --> 40:09.910]  And you can hang out with your altars and do a movie night to like boost the mood.
[40:10.590 --> 40:13.890]  And it's just these short films that they made that are pretty good.
[40:14.830 --> 40:15.310]  That's great.
[40:15.950 --> 40:16.390]  Wow.
[40:17.910 --> 40:20.270]  I'm literally going to download this game right now.
[40:21.330 --> 40:22.990]  It's yeah, I would highly recommend it.
[40:23.050 --> 40:26.610]  It's a really tough game to like describe to somebody.
[40:26.710 --> 40:26.950]  Oh, yeah.
[40:26.950 --> 40:29.990]  Why it's great, but it's really cool.
[40:31.790 --> 40:33.390]  Okay, can we go?
[40:33.670 --> 40:34.150]  Not enough resources.
[40:34.230 --> 40:34.390]  Okay.
[40:34.390 --> 40:35.170]  We need more.
[40:36.290 --> 40:40.010]  We need just like six more things of organic material.
[40:42.130 --> 40:44.070]  Grab that and then we'll start rolling.
[40:52.420 --> 40:53.980]  Okay, back to the wheel.
[40:54.140 --> 40:55.560]  I want to see us moving in the wheel.
[40:56.200 --> 40:58.860]  This is just making me think about how useless I would be.
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.200]  Like if if me grew a me that was me, like this me, I don't know what skills it would have.
[41:05.320 --> 41:06.160]  Like, how would it be useful?
[41:06.820 --> 41:07.180]  Yeah.
[41:07.380 --> 41:09.320]  No, I would be a complete waste.
[41:12.100 --> 41:12.980]  Well, that's interesting.
[41:13.160 --> 41:16.560]  They bring me out of the womb and I'm like, I got my Tom Cruise movie rankings.
[41:16.740 --> 41:17.640]  I've seen them all.
[41:17.760 --> 41:18.320]  Day two.
[41:18.440 --> 41:22.440]  But the the true me would be sitting down Mimi, just having a heart to heart.
[41:22.480 --> 41:24.820]  I'm just like, look, I've only got three slots.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.840]  All right, and you don't really do anything.
[41:28.300 --> 41:30.720]  I'm just thinking about the branching points in my life.
[41:30.720 --> 41:34.460]  That would be like, what was the moment where I picked the thing that was the least useful?
[41:34.940 --> 41:36.640]  Should I be needed to fix things?
[41:36.720 --> 41:37.180]  You know what I mean?
[41:38.260 --> 41:40.140]  Yeah, that's a really funny thought.
[41:40.240 --> 41:41.360]  An interest in history.
[41:41.560 --> 41:43.580]  You will no longer be good at repairs.
[41:45.740 --> 41:46.620]  So alters.
[41:46.840 --> 41:48.500]  So like, yeah, so it shows their skills.
[41:48.600 --> 41:50.800]  So he's 50% efficient when doing base maintenance.
[41:51.320 --> 41:53.240]  No injuries, minimal radiation, no hunger.
[41:55.080 --> 41:55.960]  Plus 50%.
[41:55.960 --> 41:56.440]  He's pissed.
[41:59.420 --> 42:00.580]  So let's go to the kitchen.
[42:01.220 --> 42:04.260]  I think Nick, you would have a branching line for each company.
[42:04.260 --> 42:05.000]  You started with Eric.
[42:07.560 --> 42:09.260]  I think you're right.
[42:10.640 --> 42:13.300]  I think there might be something to that.
[42:17.840 --> 42:19.260]  So he's not taking this well.
[42:26.610 --> 42:27.210]  Gloom.
[42:35.730 --> 42:37.410]  Damn about your comms room.
[42:37.490 --> 42:38.570]  We're moving.
[42:38.710 --> 42:39.290]  Aren't we?
[42:39.870 --> 42:40.930]  Get out of my face.
[42:44.010 --> 42:45.450]  Get out of your face.
[42:45.630 --> 42:46.610]  Yeah, deep down.
[42:46.810 --> 42:49.090]  Get out of my my face.
[42:50.510 --> 42:52.210]  Or get out of our face.
[42:59.520 --> 43:00.520]  Leave us alone.
[43:04.740 --> 43:07.320]  If you told yourself you just wanted to be by yourself.
[43:07.340 --> 43:08.480]  What do you think that would mean to them?
[43:08.480 --> 43:10.600]  Hiding in a trench is just plain stupid.
[43:10.600 --> 43:11.080]  Make out?
[43:13.600 --> 43:16.280]  Well, I think it would be I want to be with myself.
[43:18.660 --> 43:29.240]  I think about different variations of me in like a multiverse scenario a lot, but I never considered having them try to get along.
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.240]  I think that's such a fascinating idea.
[43:33.640 --> 43:35.940]  Gotta build one of these repair kits.
[43:40.420 --> 43:40.560]  Go.
[43:44.360 --> 43:47.820]  You just have like a tub at the end of that conveyor belt.
[43:48.920 --> 43:51.260]  Do we just catch the shit that it makes?
[43:51.360 --> 43:53.020]  Yeah, I gotta catch them parts.
[43:55.580 --> 43:58.200]  Fix the communication room.
[44:04.720 --> 44:07.840]  This has similar elements also to this war of mine.
[44:09.120 --> 44:12.650]  Where you're running from floor to floor fixing stuff and updating your...
[44:14.300 --> 44:15.500]  Your home base.
[44:17.940 --> 44:19.060]  Oh, Lucas.
[44:20.660 --> 44:24.180]  Ah, yeah, I'm fine.
[44:24.660 --> 44:25.660]  Things are great.
[44:38.420 --> 44:42.940]  Yeah, it's called branching, but duplicating and editing thing.
[44:43.080 --> 44:45.600]  I need to know if you pulled it off.
[44:46.240 --> 44:46.680]  Really?
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.200]  A version of me just walks in the room with the arm where my stomach is.
[44:51.680 --> 44:52.440]  It failed.
[44:52.600 --> 44:53.260]  It failed horribly.
[44:53.580 --> 44:54.340]  Yeah, I...
[44:55.680 --> 44:57.220]  You said he didn't catch his name.
[44:57.280 --> 44:58.180]  It says it on the screen.
[45:01.620 --> 45:04.420]  Yeah, I created my altar.
[45:05.160 --> 45:05.960]  Thanks for the help.
[45:06.580 --> 45:07.100]  Ha!
[45:21.090 --> 45:22.450]  We gotta go.
[45:23.770 --> 45:25.530]  The sun is chasing us.
[45:26.250 --> 45:27.490]  Can you speed up the wheel?
[45:31.530 --> 45:35.750]  We can't speed it up, but we need to try to reach an evac point.
[45:35.750 --> 45:36.590]  Is that a second thing?
[45:38.010 --> 45:40.950]  Could you lock the wheel in place and just spin the planet back around?
[45:42.650 --> 45:43.850]  Do you ever have to go to...
[45:43.850 --> 45:45.330]  Do you like a reverse time Superman thing?
[45:45.450 --> 45:45.670]  Yeah.
[45:46.070 --> 45:48.050]  How do you know you're not talking to the altar?
[45:48.310 --> 45:49.890]  I know you're not talking to him right now.
[45:49.910 --> 45:51.790]  Do you have to go to a second wheel?
[45:52.110 --> 45:52.710]  Joking, right?
[45:55.870 --> 45:57.210]  That's the altars too.
[45:57.350 --> 46:04.050]  Okay, I am just doing my best to deal with the situation and with him.
[46:04.910 --> 46:05.970]  Is he that bad?
[46:06.110 --> 46:07.570]  Can you create an altar of pimps?
[46:07.630 --> 46:08.950]  Stop with me, we'll cooperate.
[46:09.050 --> 46:10.370]  An altar of pimps?
[46:11.350 --> 46:12.650]  Then we have a problem.
[46:13.570 --> 46:14.790]  You won't manage without his help.
[46:14.910 --> 46:15.910]  You need more than three.
[46:16.410 --> 46:16.810]  That's more power in all deck.
[46:17.550 --> 46:18.090]  There should be a way to gain the strength.
[46:18.090 --> 46:19.870]  You gotta upgrade the computer for that.
[46:21.410 --> 46:23.670]  You should show him you care, maybe?
[46:24.050 --> 46:25.390]  Show our altar we care.
[46:25.510 --> 46:26.330]  I told him I wouldn't survive without him.
[46:29.560 --> 46:31.740]  I told him he was a really swell fella.
[46:32.020 --> 46:32.240]  Yeah.
[46:32.320 --> 46:33.500]  He's still mad at me.
[46:33.780 --> 46:35.020]  I like me, I said.
[46:35.700 --> 46:36.300]  Just a thought.
[46:37.920 --> 46:41.160]  My grandma used to say, sharing is caring.
[46:42.380 --> 46:42.660]  Yay.
[46:43.520 --> 46:44.540]  Let me think.
[46:45.240 --> 46:46.360]  What can I share with him?
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.480]  My playlist?
[46:48.000 --> 46:48.440]  Wait, what?
[46:49.260 --> 46:50.420]  He just has one playlist.
[46:50.860 --> 46:51.340]  Yeah.
[46:52.940 --> 46:54.940]  I don't know if I have a playlist.
[46:55.320 --> 46:57.080]  Oh, I'm not a real playlist guy.
[46:57.880 --> 46:58.600]  No, neither am I.
[46:59.320 --> 47:00.120]  I got a few.
[47:00.440 --> 47:00.960]  Of course.
[47:02.080 --> 47:02.560]  Memories.
[47:03.260 --> 47:04.900]  I wonder if he remembers things.
[47:05.180 --> 47:06.580]  I think Yacht Rock is my most go-to.
[47:07.020 --> 47:07.140]  Yeah.
[47:09.360 --> 47:11.640]  I enjoy going to other people's places.
[47:12.440 --> 47:13.780]  They could be a source of information.
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.080]  I enjoy someone sharing a playlist with me and then me being able to like, alter it to what I like.
[47:20.660 --> 47:21.140]  Sure.
[47:22.360 --> 47:22.920]  Don't worry.
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.120]  I've gotten really into listening to the radio in like the last four months.
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.220]  Like the actual radio?
[47:30.580 --> 47:30.640]  Yeah.
[47:30.680 --> 47:31.360]  Over the air?
[47:31.360 --> 47:34.040]  The actual, I'm listening to over the air radio.
[47:35.680 --> 47:36.920]  Largely music channels.
[47:37.080 --> 47:38.180]  It's just, it's nice.
[47:39.040 --> 47:42.880]  It's nice to not curate my own content in that way.
[47:43.020 --> 47:45.320]  I can just listen to things that I don't have to think about.
[47:46.460 --> 47:50.060]  You know, I had that thought because I cut, I cut cable for a while.
[47:50.600 --> 47:51.880]  I have YouTube TV now.
[47:52.460 --> 47:54.680]  And I didn't realize till the other day.
[47:54.700 --> 47:59.780]  I was just like flipping through and I was like, I'd like just things popping up and me not having to pick them.
[48:00.520 --> 48:00.840]  Yes.
[48:01.360 --> 48:02.420]  I feel the opposite.
[48:03.780 --> 48:04.140]  Really?
[48:05.080 --> 48:13.740]  I kind of love it if a streaming app when I opened it would just go straight back to what I was watching instead of having to scroll back through pages of shit that it thinks I want to watch.
[48:15.360 --> 48:16.240]  That's a fair point.
[48:16.720 --> 48:18.020]  If you know what you want, that's one thing.
[48:18.160 --> 48:24.900]  But for me, sometimes it's like, yes, I just kind of want to mindlessly put on, ah, diners, rabbits and dives and I'll watch the commercials.
[48:25.060 --> 48:25.340]  I don't care.
[48:28.800 --> 48:30.060]  Or the weather channel.
[48:30.220 --> 48:30.840]  I love the weather channel.
[48:30.840 --> 48:32.160]  Oh, the weather channel.
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.360]  Nick, I love the weather channel.
[48:34.480 --> 48:34.760]  I know.
[48:35.040 --> 48:35.440]  I got that.
[48:35.560 --> 48:36.440]  What's on the weather channel?
[48:36.700 --> 48:37.060]  Weather?
[48:37.360 --> 48:37.720]  Weather.
[48:38.980 --> 48:39.700]  Lots of it.
[48:39.800 --> 48:41.740]  Like, it's just the weather or it's like extreme weather.
[48:42.660 --> 48:44.260]  It's, uh, well, there's extreme weather.
[48:44.360 --> 48:44.860]  They cover it.
[48:45.420 --> 48:52.260]  But usually it's like three people in like a rotation talking about weather in different parts of the country and or world.
[48:52.460 --> 48:54.980]  And they're like, here's this for this time frame.
[48:55.080 --> 48:56.420]  And this is what we're seeing out in the gulf.
[48:56.480 --> 48:57.720]  Or this is what we're seeing over here.
[48:57.980 --> 48:59.120]  And from thing to thing.
[48:59.160 --> 48:59.300]  How's that?
[48:59.780 --> 49:00.320]  Oh, go ahead.
[49:00.840 --> 49:03.260]  Has there ever been a day where it was sunny everywhere?
[49:04.480 --> 49:05.940]  I was always not a chance.
[49:06.260 --> 49:08.080]  A heartbeat away from doing it.
[49:08.220 --> 49:08.920]  But well, it'd be nice.
[49:09.200 --> 49:09.540]  Today's weather.
[49:10.020 --> 49:11.780]  Listen, I don't care where you live.
[49:12.080 --> 49:13.280]  Sit down and listen.
[49:13.420 --> 49:14.140]  It's sunny.
[49:15.360 --> 49:18.120]  Like, surely that was the cloudiest day in history.
[49:18.260 --> 49:18.520]  Yeah.
[49:18.660 --> 49:19.260]  Well, yeah.
[49:19.340 --> 49:20.940]  Just no one anywhere could see the sun.
[49:22.380 --> 49:23.980]  But then I reached a breaking point.
[49:25.700 --> 49:26.580]  Ice age.
[49:26.800 --> 49:28.840]  Didn't hang around long enough to reach yours.
[49:28.840 --> 49:35.270]  Or maybe I was a coward.
[49:35.870 --> 49:39.170]  Going to college was a good excuse to just get away from it all.
[49:40.390 --> 49:42.990]  Oh, so that's where our paths split.
[49:44.050 --> 49:46.450]  Did you shine out there?
[49:47.030 --> 49:47.830]  Were you best in class?
[49:47.830 --> 49:50.230]  Were you ranked 17 in a class of 600?
[49:53.270 --> 49:55.250]  Now build around this, Marigold.
[49:55.250 --> 49:56.470]  I don't think there was a rank.
[49:56.610 --> 49:59.410]  And I didn't think anyone knew how smart they were at our school.
[49:59.590 --> 50:00.030]  Sorry to disappoint.
[50:00.790 --> 50:03.070]  No, I'm not aware of any public ranking like that.
[50:03.110 --> 50:04.950]  I guess it's not necessarily public.
[50:06.350 --> 50:07.750]  You just know your own ranking.
[50:07.910 --> 50:08.890]  But still, that's...
[50:09.730 --> 50:10.450]  I think...
[50:10.450 --> 50:11.330]  That's a weird social game.
[50:11.650 --> 50:12.590]  Yeah, that's a weird thing.
[50:12.710 --> 50:14.590]  We made it a competition between each other.
[50:14.790 --> 50:15.450]  My friends and I.
[50:19.290 --> 50:21.430]  But quick, let's see who can be the most successful.
[50:23.590 --> 50:26.050]  I mean, here in high school, a lot of people just don't give a shit.
[50:27.070 --> 50:27.510]  Sometimes.
[50:29.490 --> 50:33.550]  But also, for us, in the States, it's like...
[50:34.170 --> 50:36.810]  The top 10% is the thing that used to get you into college.
[50:38.710 --> 50:43.690]  Or like, would give you, I guess, more of an ins...
[50:43.690 --> 50:45.610]  Whoa, I don't even know how to describe it.
[50:46.570 --> 50:50.530]  It was a thing that was looked well upon, I guess, by universities.
[50:51.930 --> 50:53.230]  It's a pierogi.
[50:56.130 --> 50:57.390]  Dude, I love pierogi.
[50:57.790 --> 50:58.330]  Pierogi's good.
[50:59.130 --> 50:59.810]  What do we want to go with?
[50:59.910 --> 51:03.790]  Coolant and oil, beer and synthetic, grease and fun... fungicide.
[51:06.150 --> 51:06.950]  What are we feeling?
[51:07.270 --> 51:08.170]  Beer and synthetic starch.
[51:23.930 --> 51:25.650]  What do you eat a pierogi with?
[51:26.530 --> 51:27.130]  Mouth.
[51:29.090 --> 51:30.610]  I deserve that.
[51:33.590 --> 51:35.030]  What do you serve it with?
[51:36.070 --> 51:36.670]  Hands.
[51:36.910 --> 51:37.870]  I don't, uh...
[51:37.870 --> 51:38.710]  God damn it!
[51:47.770 --> 51:49.810]  Oh, a new memory of them hanging out.
[51:50.530 --> 51:51.130]  Yeah!
[51:52.290 --> 51:53.790]  Having their pierogis.
[51:54.870 --> 51:57.290]  This is a real bonding moment for us.
[52:00.010 --> 52:02.730]  Now I know how mom must have felt that day.
[52:02.790 --> 52:10.820]  She had a terrible fight.
[52:10.960 --> 52:17.320]  I put like a ton of salt into the filling and I overcooked them into a shapeless pulp.
[52:17.940 --> 52:22.300]  They were inedible, but you remember what she did?
[52:22.460 --> 52:23.160]  Choked and died?
[52:24.120 --> 52:26.740]  She ate them all and never said a word.
[52:26.860 --> 52:27.600]  You guessed that.
[52:27.600 --> 52:28.320]  She said they were delicious.
[52:28.320 --> 52:28.940]  Wasn't on the board.
[52:29.200 --> 52:30.280]  That was a different brunch.
[52:30.960 --> 52:31.640]  Yeah, you're right.
[52:32.840 --> 52:33.220]  So?
[52:34.560 --> 52:36.120]  They're delicious, man.
[52:37.840 --> 52:40.000]  Oh, shut the fuck up.
[52:42.180 --> 52:44.620]  I wonder how confusing this was for the voice actor.
[52:45.940 --> 52:47.200]  Which one is this one again?
[52:51.120 --> 52:52.800]  I hope he gets into...
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.260]  I hope he gets into doing impressions of his other alters.
[52:59.360 --> 52:59.840]  So...
[53:00.620 --> 53:01.100]  So...
[53:01.100 --> 53:03.540]  There is an amazing sequence between...
[53:03.540 --> 53:05.560]  So this game is sort of in a three-act structure.
[53:06.660 --> 53:11.080]  And the sequence between act one and act two is delightful.
[53:11.880 --> 53:17.120]  Do you mean did I come to terms with waking up as tech support for my doppelganger?
[53:18.200 --> 53:25.120]  You might have to give me something stronger than dehydrated dumplings to wrap my head around that.
[53:26.980 --> 53:28.460]  Now you're being mean.
[53:28.740 --> 53:31.940]  I went through a lot of trouble to make those and they weren't that bad.
[53:32.700 --> 53:33.980]  You made an effort.
[53:34.520 --> 53:35.380]  I'll give you that.
[53:36.640 --> 53:39.840]  It's weird that it doesn't cut back and forth between the two Yans.
[53:40.640 --> 53:40.940]  Oh, yeah.
[53:41.240 --> 53:43.080]  It only looks at the one you're talking to.
[53:44.100 --> 53:47.100]  That is a great point that I've never even thought about.
[53:48.300 --> 53:51.160]  I guess they're just trying to keep you in the mind of this one Yan.
[53:51.660 --> 53:53.040]  Yeah, it might have been too jarring.
[54:05.920 --> 54:07.020]  Can you name them?
[54:08.160 --> 54:08.440]  No.
[54:09.780 --> 54:10.800]  They're all Yandulski.
[54:13.820 --> 54:15.840]  They're just identified by their...
[54:15.840 --> 54:18.080]  Their, yeah, Yan technician.
[54:26.560 --> 54:29.320]  He strikes me as a fuck the corporation guy.
[54:29.400 --> 54:30.160]  Let's go with that.
[54:39.920 --> 54:42.840]  He asks who's the CEO now.
[54:57.360 --> 54:59.300]  We'll improvise.
[55:12.580 --> 55:16.940]  That sort of becomes the loop is making sure we have resources and managing things.
[55:18.860 --> 55:20.960]  Also trying to continue to make it to our evac.
[55:27.360 --> 55:31.420]  Do they always come out the current age of the person who made them?
[55:32.920 --> 55:33.360]  Yes.
[55:33.840 --> 55:37.220]  So like if you made one in a year, it wouldn't be this old.
[55:37.280 --> 55:38.100]  It would be a year older.
[55:39.540 --> 55:39.960]  I guess.
[55:40.020 --> 55:40.320]  I don't know.
[55:40.320 --> 55:42.120]  You're you're like, that's the hypothetical.
[55:42.500 --> 55:44.280]  I don't feel qualified to answer that.
[55:44.740 --> 55:53.380]  I would assume so because it seems as though that it's branching based off of current use memories as like the end point.
[55:54.180 --> 55:56.000]  Yeah, but does the corporation have all those points?
[55:57.440 --> 55:58.220]  That's true.
[55:58.280 --> 55:58.980]  And I guess I don't know.
[55:59.020 --> 56:03.280]  I guess you could think about the potential of them like projecting future.
[56:03.280 --> 56:07.860]  One day, you'll look back and realize I was the easy one.
[56:08.720 --> 56:09.980]  Mark my words.
[56:10.200 --> 56:14.220]  What if you got a version that was exactly the same, but it just never had chickenpox?
[56:16.160 --> 56:17.940]  The most mundane difference.
[56:21.980 --> 56:22.480]  Call.
[56:23.340 --> 56:26.220]  I feel like you gotta be careful about crushing the other ones with the lift.
[56:27.880 --> 56:28.380]  Lena.
[56:28.600 --> 56:29.060]  Who's Lena?
[56:30.340 --> 56:31.540]  That's our ex-wife.
[56:31.860 --> 56:32.360]  Oh.
[56:34.220 --> 56:34.800]  Oh, Lena.
[56:35.860 --> 56:36.260]  Lena.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.820]  Do you think it's interesting now that kids will never have to have like a chickenpox party again?
[56:43.560 --> 56:44.780]  A chickenpox party?
[56:45.320 --> 56:45.960]  Because of the vaccine.
[56:46.440 --> 56:47.100]  Yeah, because of the vaccine.
[56:47.340 --> 56:50.240]  But back in the day, Andrew, you may be even too young for this.
[56:50.600 --> 56:54.700]  They used to get like all the kids who had chickenpox together with other kids who didn't.
[56:55.220 --> 56:58.620]  Just with the intent of everybody getting it done and over with at the same time.
[56:58.940 --> 57:00.680]  Yeah, but that's just old school.
[57:00.680 --> 57:03.820]  I don't think I was ever part of one of those.
[57:03.940 --> 57:06.200]  I just, if you went to school, you just got it.
[57:06.680 --> 57:09.040]  My friend's parents were all like, well, this one has it.
[57:09.060 --> 57:11.060]  Just get them all together so they all get it over with.
[57:11.200 --> 57:12.780]  That is disgusting.
[57:13.980 --> 57:14.460]  It worked.
[57:16.780 --> 57:17.880]  We're all done pretty quick.
[57:19.320 --> 57:22.320]  Yeah, but it's not always complication free.
[57:23.260 --> 57:23.480]  No.
[57:24.460 --> 57:27.440]  But back then, they didn't have the vaccine.
[57:27.600 --> 57:30.120]  So better to get it as a young person than as an adult.
[57:30.680 --> 57:33.140]  Yeah, I just feel like you would get it.
[57:36.680 --> 57:42.080]  I remember thinking it's not nearly as fun as it sounds as someone who loves chicken.
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.540]  I feel as though I should be running towards this, but everything I hear is not great.
[57:49.040 --> 57:50.340]  Well, it's the pox part.
[57:50.400 --> 57:52.540]  You should really probably pay more attention to.
[57:52.700 --> 57:54.580]  Yeah, we haven't spoken.
[57:54.920 --> 57:57.120]  It was one of those things in like second grade.
[57:57.120 --> 57:58.460]  I remember kids getting it.
[57:58.540 --> 58:00.660]  Maybe am I ever going to get this?
[58:01.140 --> 58:03.340]  Am I going to get like I almost felt left out there.
[58:03.460 --> 58:05.040]  Did you get it or did you not?
[58:05.200 --> 58:06.800]  Eventually, I called.
[58:07.400 --> 58:09.200]  Do you have a small pox pie?
[58:13.820 --> 58:15.460]  You know your way around.
[58:15.940 --> 58:17.500]  My wife never caught chicken pox.
[58:17.740 --> 58:18.660]  Been a couple of years.
[58:18.700 --> 58:18.940]  Really?
[58:19.420 --> 58:19.720]  No.
[58:20.960 --> 58:22.240]  Her brother never did either.
[58:22.500 --> 58:25.200]  They have like a weird maybe immunity to it.
[58:25.240 --> 58:25.520]  I don't know.
[58:26.260 --> 58:28.960]  The like the most low stakes Ellie scenario.
[58:29.120 --> 58:29.440]  Yeah, right.
[58:31.360 --> 58:32.280]  Can you imagine?
[58:32.840 --> 58:33.900]  No, it's pretty bad.
[58:33.960 --> 58:34.560]  Is it at all though?
[58:34.560 --> 58:35.100]  Isn't it?
[58:35.160 --> 58:35.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:37.300 --> 58:37.820]  It can.
[58:38.220 --> 58:39.440]  So she still hasn't had it?
[58:39.840 --> 58:40.920]  No, still never had it.
[58:41.160 --> 58:42.000]  Could she get the vaccine?
[58:42.380 --> 58:42.880]  Yeah, she did.
[58:43.560 --> 58:45.220]  Damn, that's cool.
[58:47.260 --> 58:50.040]  Right, to avoid your whole life and then have the backup of the vaccine.
[58:52.640 --> 58:53.460]  Or I guess the front.
[58:53.660 --> 58:54.060]  I don't know.
[58:56.000 --> 58:56.420]  Yeah.
[58:57.500 --> 58:58.320]  I'd like that.
[58:59.540 --> 58:59.960]  Thanks.
[59:04.970 --> 59:05.770]  Talk soon.
[59:06.570 --> 59:07.090]  Well, like Archie.
[59:07.150 --> 59:10.110]  Archie will never get it unless, you know, vaccine runs out.
[59:10.210 --> 59:12.130]  Whereas often he becomes an adult or whatever.
[59:12.690 --> 59:14.270]  Is the vaccine 100% effective?
[59:15.710 --> 59:16.490]  That's a good question.
[59:16.630 --> 59:17.330]  That's a great question.
[59:18.430 --> 59:18.910]  I don't know.
[59:19.930 --> 59:21.330]  I like the little sheep, it's a little loading.
[59:28.710 --> 59:29.230]  Too early.
[59:30.530 --> 59:32.670]  Don't tell me something's wrong with the base again.
[59:33.270 --> 59:34.110]  Oh boy.
[59:34.370 --> 59:35.830]  We gotta change the tire.
[59:39.550 --> 59:42.170]  Runs outside with a little inflatable pump.
[59:43.230 --> 59:45.210]  Where's the 600-story jack?
[59:46.230 --> 59:47.690]  The temperature dropped here.
[59:47.770 --> 59:49.170]  So we have to go out and pump it up.
[59:49.830 --> 59:51.750]  Oh man, we ran over a nail.
[59:52.050 --> 59:52.930]  Oh no.
[59:54.970 --> 59:55.630]  All right.
[59:55.630 --> 59:58.450]  There's a regular-sized nail somewhere in this tire.
[59:58.830 --> 59:59.910]  Let's get out of there.
[01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:02.490]  Act one.
[01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:04.490]  The whole act is trying to find the nail.
[01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:05.470]  Oh God.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.880]  Do you think it's in act three, you find the rest of the bicycle?
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.540]  To get off planet, we need the four wheels.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.100]  It's a unicycle situation.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.220]  Oh, it could be a unicycle.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.980]  Just a big dude on it.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.240]  Let's just pop out and see what's going on.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.540]  And then I think we can wrap.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.820]  So this is sort of like we did the tutorial.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.440]  Now we're out in this new area.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.380]  Gotta find new shit.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.380]  Gotta get new resources.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.020]  Wow.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:34.540]  This is awesome.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.660]  We're heading this way.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:39.780]  Let's see.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.160]  What's up?
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.540]  Just turn around and the wheels rolling away.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.860]  So we got to figure out how to cross this.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:48.920]  Oh, the ramp.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.940]  Yeah, just build a bridge.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.280]  Roadcraft style.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.380]  Let's get some sand.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.060]  Let's dump it.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:02.880]  So before I wrap the video, let's see if we can go to the quantum computer really quick.
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.640]  And if it shows.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.380]  The different us's.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.800]  I think it should be filled out now.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:12.260]  Yeah.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.500]  So these are all of the different points in which we have.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.220]  Whoa.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.680]  And it's like a doctor.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.740]  Shrink would be a second one.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.180]  It's always occupation based.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.120]  Yeah.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:25.960]  Minor.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.320]  So 50% more efficient when mining metals.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.820]  Disciplines alters in the contemplation room.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:34.800]  You can have a guard.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.700]  Botanist.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.200]  If you want to go full.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.640]  The Martian.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.360]  Scientist.
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:48.800]  So like you have to pick and it splits at these different points and then you can follow their narrative branching and it's all very cool.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:49.720]  Yeah, I don't.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.640]  This game is awesome.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.680]  I don't see podcaster on there.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.020]  Podcaster, unfortunately, didn't make the list.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:57.640]  Not useful.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.520]  This is the alters.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.740]  I wanted to show you guys this game.
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.180]  It's really.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:01.980]  That's awesome.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:02.700]  Thanks for showing it.
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:03.240]  Yeah.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:03.720]  Check it out.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.460]  It's great.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.660]  Highly recommend it.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.140]  But thank you so much to the people that watched.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.760]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.680]  We have tons of other gameplay stuff.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.380]  We do podcast.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.980]  Check out our Patreon at the regulation pod.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:20.320]  We have a fantastic day and you're not stuck in a unicycle of death.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.340]  Like Jan Dolski.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.520]  Until next time.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:24.460]  Talk to you later.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:24.820]  Bye.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:25.320]  Bye.
