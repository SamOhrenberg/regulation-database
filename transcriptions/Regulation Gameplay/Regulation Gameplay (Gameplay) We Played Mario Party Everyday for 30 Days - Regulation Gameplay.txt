[00:00.000 --> 00:02.260]  All right. How do we get this started here?
[00:03.220 --> 00:04.080]  Get on the damn balloon.
[00:04.240 --> 00:07.020]  Who wants to introduce Mario Party March and then get it going?
[00:07.620 --> 00:09.900]  Well, we should get to the through the settings and all that first.
[00:10.140 --> 00:12.680]  Yeah, we probably start on the 30 turn screen or something.
[00:13.020 --> 00:14.660]  Well, we don't want people to see the settings.
[00:16.640 --> 00:16.820]  What?
[00:18.080 --> 00:19.920]  I thought that was a very clear question.
[00:20.020 --> 00:21.140]  Was that question crazy?
[00:21.420 --> 00:22.820]  No, I thought that was.
[00:23.000 --> 00:23.860]  I don't know.
[00:24.080 --> 00:25.960]  I don't know how to be more clear about that question.
[00:26.560 --> 00:27.380]  I don't know what to tell you.
[00:27.640 --> 00:28.720]  It feels like people would want it.
[00:28.720 --> 00:31.180]  I feel like, especially in this audience, we want to know the rules.
[00:31.640 --> 00:33.760]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:33.760 --> 00:35.820]  Hello and welcome to Mario Party March.
[00:35.820 --> 00:36.600]  That's what I said.
[00:37.040 --> 00:39.240]  We play one turn per thing.
[00:40.100 --> 00:40.360]  What?
[00:40.600 --> 00:43.560]  I said we should start on the screen where we're showing all the how many turns
[00:43.560 --> 00:43.920]  and all that.
[00:44.020 --> 00:45.720]  Well, we're there. We're here. We started.
[00:46.500 --> 00:47.880]  This is day one.
[00:48.660 --> 00:50.240]  Gavin is already killing Eric.
[00:50.500 --> 00:51.740]  I'm not even playing.
[00:52.440 --> 00:53.920]  We're off to a great start.
[00:54.040 --> 00:57.360]  Hey, before we get started, are you guys excited about this?
[00:57.380 --> 00:58.580]  Are you guys feeling pumped up?
[00:58.580 --> 01:02.120]  Yeah, I woke up earlier and I was nervous.
[01:02.300 --> 01:04.920]  I was like, this is we're probably never going to do this again.
[01:05.100 --> 01:07.040]  This game has substantial weight.
[01:07.140 --> 01:10.740]  Even though there's nothing on the line, I feel like tremendous
[01:10.740 --> 01:11.800]  competitive pressure.
[01:12.140 --> 01:12.980]  I'm excited.
[01:13.540 --> 01:14.600]  Yeah, I woke up so excited.
[01:14.680 --> 01:15.420]  I'm like vibrating.
[01:15.560 --> 01:18.160]  I'm sitting in this chair with the energy of like a soccer fan.
[01:18.320 --> 01:19.120]  So I've decided.
[01:19.360 --> 01:19.960]  Hold on a second.
[01:23.540 --> 01:25.520]  Yeah, you do the wave shirt off.
[01:25.520 --> 01:27.940]  No, I'm going to go shirtless this whole.
[01:28.140 --> 01:29.540]  I'm taking all month long.
[01:29.660 --> 01:30.860]  Maybe Geoff doesn't wear a shirt.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.080]  I'm just nipples out.
[01:33.220 --> 01:34.560]  Fucking ready to rock.
[01:34.640 --> 01:36.360]  Let's play some Mario Party.
[01:37.040 --> 01:37.320]  Let's do it.
[01:37.500 --> 01:38.000]  Skids out.
[01:38.220 --> 01:39.520]  Gavin, what are all the rules?
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.400]  Now, I hate to inform you, but 30 turns.
[01:42.540 --> 01:45.100]  We could be playing for around 210 minutes.
[01:45.660 --> 01:46.960]  Oh, yeah, a little bit longer.
[01:47.360 --> 01:49.660]  Yeah, we'll spread it out over the course of 30 days or so.
[01:49.720 --> 01:51.720]  It'll feel like that'll make it way shorter.
[01:51.900 --> 01:53.460]  It'll feel like no time at all.
[01:53.580 --> 01:54.500]  Everyone got their Joy-Con?
[01:54.500 --> 01:56.000]  Yes. Yes.
[01:56.160 --> 01:56.860]  All right.
[01:58.300 --> 01:59.340]  Well, let's go then.
[02:00.120 --> 02:01.100]  Let's do it.
[02:01.580 --> 02:02.620]  Day one.
[02:03.960 --> 02:04.920]  Day one.
[02:05.960 --> 02:07.400]  I got my high heels on.
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.460]  I cannot believe Al Pacino wasn't in that balloon or else I'd be real nervous.
[02:14.140 --> 02:15.620]  Oh, everyone's so excited.
[02:15.920 --> 02:17.340]  And none of us have ever done this map.
[02:17.840 --> 02:19.160]  Yeah, no, we picked up.
[02:19.320 --> 02:22.760]  We picked this raceway because we've never done it.
[02:23.220 --> 02:24.020]  Oh, it's small.
[02:24.020 --> 02:24.860]  Holy shit.
[02:24.920 --> 02:26.760]  Oh, you guys are really going to run into each other.
[02:27.140 --> 02:28.300]  Oh, oh, my God.
[02:29.260 --> 02:31.620]  Oh, oh, oh, boy.
[02:32.300 --> 02:32.660]  Dangerous.
[02:33.080 --> 02:34.360]  Look, we got cars.
[02:36.120 --> 02:37.280]  Should we hear about the board?
[02:37.420 --> 02:38.860]  Yeah. Oh, you got to hear about the board.
[02:38.940 --> 02:39.860]  Gotta hear about it.
[02:40.260 --> 02:40.740]  I don't know.
[02:41.520 --> 02:42.420]  Welcome to the track.
[02:42.480 --> 02:44.360]  Hop in a race car and drive the circuit.
[02:45.580 --> 02:49.200]  You can get two stars at these two star mark locations.
[02:50.120 --> 02:52.240]  Whoa. First star can be found at the top of the lane.
[02:52.240 --> 02:55.100]  When it's collected, the next star will appear on the lower lane.
[02:55.540 --> 02:56.020]  Oh, wow.
[02:56.380 --> 02:58.120]  This is the dice stop for 10 coins.
[02:58.220 --> 02:59.940]  You'll get a full tank of dice items.
[03:00.820 --> 03:01.960]  These are the jump pads.
[03:02.060 --> 03:05.420]  Stopping on one will launch you to the opposite side of the track.
[03:05.760 --> 03:07.760]  Whoa. This is the swap machine.
[03:07.880 --> 03:10.160]  If you stop on either of the spaces in front of it.
[03:12.940 --> 03:14.980]  Oh, oh, it's swapping.
[03:15.340 --> 03:19.060]  Oh, the jump pads and item shops will swap for two turns.
[03:19.380 --> 03:21.240]  Oh, shit. Exciting.
[03:21.240 --> 03:22.060]  Complicated.
[03:22.440 --> 03:24.980]  Pass under this arch to complete a lap and earn a lap bonus.
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.020]  You get 10 coins for one lap, then 20 for lap two.
[03:29.060 --> 03:31.080]  Oh, my. 30 coins after lap three.
[03:31.260 --> 03:33.100]  This is going to be a rich game.
[03:33.620 --> 03:34.040]  Crazy. Wow.
[03:34.860 --> 03:36.120]  We're traveling above the bar.
[03:36.240 --> 03:37.580]  Now we got to hit the dice.
[03:37.820 --> 03:38.620]  OK, who is who?
[03:39.080 --> 03:40.740]  Yes, Geoff gets one.
[03:40.960 --> 03:42.000]  All right, Geoff is the mole.
[03:42.760 --> 03:43.380]  Good for you.
[03:44.560 --> 03:45.300]  Dill's next.
[03:46.200 --> 03:47.660]  Oh, my God.
[03:47.860 --> 03:48.100]  No!
[03:51.420 --> 03:53.600]  All right, Wario, go for it.
[03:54.200 --> 03:56.420]  Wario got more than all three of us combined.
[03:56.840 --> 03:58.300]  Wow. Yes.
[03:58.700 --> 04:00.460]  Hold him down. I'll throw a barrel at him.
[04:00.540 --> 04:01.180]  It's coming up, Mario.
[04:01.580 --> 04:04.260]  It's Mario, Wario, Dillkong and the mole.
[04:04.640 --> 04:05.500]  Monty Mole. That's fine.
[04:05.580 --> 04:07.140]  I'm getting my bad roll out here.
[04:07.480 --> 04:09.660]  This one's going to be 10 out the gate. Get him out.
[04:09.940 --> 04:12.600]  It's going to be so annoying to immediately stop playing.
[04:12.840 --> 04:14.260]  That's exactly how this is going to happen.
[04:14.520 --> 04:17.900]  We just did all this introduction and we are going to be done.
[04:18.340 --> 04:20.460]  I'm going to be pacing around my room after we're done recording.
[04:20.460 --> 04:23.440]  You're just going to have to sit on all this energy for 24 fucking hours.
[04:23.800 --> 04:25.580]  I've had too much coffee already for this.
[04:25.600 --> 04:27.300]  Don't worry, it's only 22 hours.
[04:27.400 --> 04:30.080]  We're doing this two hours later than we're going to be doing it all month long.
[04:30.400 --> 04:33.280]  You're going to need to put on your lid on your gerpler of excitement.
[04:34.620 --> 04:36.280]  Turn one, day one.
[04:36.480 --> 04:37.800]  Here we go. Here we go.
[04:38.460 --> 04:39.960]  Yeah. The month begins.
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.020]  Nice. Oh, you got a six.
[04:42.680 --> 04:45.120]  Hey, as of right now, we're all even, Steven.
[04:45.740 --> 04:46.260]  No, next one.
[04:46.360 --> 04:47.640]  Never mind, Gavin's ahead.
[04:47.880 --> 04:48.720]  Or Nick's ahead, sorry.
[04:50.460 --> 04:55.560]  All right, let's get a nice, a nice, fat, juicy day one roll.
[04:58.240 --> 04:59.600]  Sad, eh? Get a seven.
[05:00.180 --> 05:02.620]  Oh, wow, that's a full week roll.
[05:03.060 --> 05:04.780]  It's got kind of like an inside track here.
[05:05.040 --> 05:07.780]  Oh, oh, oh, I'll take this.
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.860]  Let's go to the other lane.
[05:09.420 --> 05:10.760]  Oh, it just knocks you out. Pet activated.
[05:11.380 --> 05:11.780]  Boing!
[05:12.580 --> 05:13.480]  Later, dipshit.
[05:13.580 --> 05:15.640]  This is what we were doing in Human Fall Flat yesterday.
[05:16.140 --> 05:18.340]  Wow, you went so far up ahead.
[05:18.380 --> 05:20.240]  Wow, that really pushes you up.
[05:20.460 --> 05:21.080]  Shit.
[05:22.200 --> 05:23.820]  Now everybody step aside.
[05:23.980 --> 05:25.240]  Let me show you how the pros do it.
[05:25.340 --> 05:25.680]  Let me show you.
[05:25.680 --> 05:26.460]  Dill Kong time.
[05:26.760 --> 05:28.200]  Here we go. Look at them charging the dice.
[05:28.460 --> 05:29.640]  Whabam! Nine!
[05:29.800 --> 05:30.160]  Whoa!
[05:30.780 --> 05:31.820]  Full of dilly bars.
[05:32.020 --> 05:32.440]  I told you!
[05:34.120 --> 05:34.760]  Where'd he go? Dill.
[05:35.040 --> 05:36.580]  Wow, nice job, Dillons.
[05:36.840 --> 05:37.540]  Right before the shop.
[05:40.260 --> 05:42.180]  And we saved the best for last.
[05:42.660 --> 05:43.960]  Oh, Grandpa Mole.
[05:44.120 --> 05:44.940]  Here we go.
[05:45.780 --> 05:46.740]  Grandpa Mole!
[05:46.740 --> 05:47.140]  Grandpa Mole.
[05:47.800 --> 05:48.200]  Whap!
[05:49.280 --> 05:49.680]  Right down the middle.
[05:50.100 --> 05:50.500]  Five's fine.
[05:51.160 --> 05:52.100]  Yeah, totally fine.
[05:52.680 --> 05:53.780]  Okay, not great.
[05:54.100 --> 05:55.440]  Not great, not great.
[05:55.460 --> 05:56.860]  Three on one.
[05:57.060 --> 05:58.940]  And it's right on the fucking camera, too.
[05:59.780 --> 06:01.360]  And it's everyone against Geoff.
[06:01.740 --> 06:03.340]  Kicking the shit out of Geoff, day one.
[06:06.340 --> 06:06.740]  Hi.
[06:07.100 --> 06:07.780]  Go easy on me.
[06:08.080 --> 06:08.480]  Hi.
[06:09.040 --> 06:09.740]  Well, you know.
[06:09.980 --> 06:10.480]  Oh, no.
[06:10.580 --> 06:13.060]  You can stop Gavin right here by throwing the game, Dill.
[06:13.060 --> 06:14.020]  Oh, I hate this one.
[06:14.120 --> 06:15.220]  You ready to blame it on the crane?
[06:15.220 --> 06:17.740]  I don't think I've ever played it on this side.
[06:18.020 --> 06:18.840]  Uh-oh.
[06:19.040 --> 06:20.240]  I think I've always been the crane.
[06:20.240 --> 06:20.720]  I'll be honest.
[06:21.200 --> 06:23.160]  I'm really excited that Geoff's mad at the crane.
[06:25.760 --> 06:26.680]  What does that mean?
[06:27.040 --> 06:28.240]  He doesn't have faith in me.
[06:28.240 --> 06:28.860]  I'm very excited.
[06:29.080 --> 06:30.640]  Oh, that's not very nice.
[06:31.040 --> 06:33.360]  Yeah, it's much like when we play Warzone at night.
[06:33.500 --> 06:36.400]  I have a lot of faith that Gavin's going to, I don't know, get hit by a train
[06:36.400 --> 06:37.300]  because he's not paying attention.
[06:37.700 --> 06:39.040]  What are you doing, Geoff?
[06:39.700 --> 06:40.820]  Geoff, you can move the crane.
[06:41.140 --> 06:41.840]  Yeah, I know. I know.
[06:42.180 --> 06:43.700]  I got tactics, guys. Don't worry.
[06:43.780 --> 06:44.240]  He got me!
[06:44.240 --> 06:46.100]  I got Gavin immediately.
[06:46.520 --> 06:48.440]  It's because I was so smug about it.
[06:48.440 --> 06:50.240]  You were so smug.
[06:50.500 --> 06:51.500]  Nope, nope, nope.
[06:52.800 --> 06:52.920]  Nick?
[06:53.780 --> 06:55.520]  Locked it in, locked it in, Nick.
[06:55.980 --> 06:57.460]  Oh, what a dodge.
[06:57.780 --> 06:58.720]  That was good. That was good.
[06:59.040 --> 06:59.800]  You have 20 seconds.
[07:00.540 --> 07:00.900]  Yeah!
[07:02.300 --> 07:03.620]  Nick might be good at this.
[07:04.220 --> 07:05.400]  Nick, we just got to stay alive.
[07:06.240 --> 07:07.400]  Oh, wow, Geoff!
[07:08.520 --> 07:10.520]  We got him. There's no way he can get both of us.
[07:10.900 --> 07:12.000]  Yeah, I don't need to get both of you.
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.060]  I just want to get Nick.
[07:13.060 --> 07:14.280]  Just have to get Nick.
[07:15.620 --> 07:18.160]  Dilcom lives! Dilcom lives for the team!
[07:18.880 --> 07:20.440]  Look at that, Andrew did it for himself.
[07:20.580 --> 07:22.000]  Always looking out for number one, man.
[07:24.800 --> 07:26.120]  Well, there you have it.
[07:26.380 --> 07:28.820]  I officially no longer like the three of you.
[07:30.620 --> 07:32.080]  29 more days of this hell.
[07:32.460 --> 07:33.840]  Wow, dude, they have so many more coins.
[07:33.920 --> 07:35.060]  You have seven coins.
[07:35.240 --> 07:36.860]  Wow, dude.
[07:37.280 --> 07:38.400]  How much does it cost for a star?
[07:39.160 --> 07:39.560]  20.
[07:40.020 --> 07:41.720]  Oh, wow. You guys can all get coins.
[07:41.880 --> 07:42.600]  And that's it!
[07:42.600 --> 07:44.420]  We did it! Day one is done!
[07:44.440 --> 07:46.660]  This concludes the end of turn one, day one.
[07:46.940 --> 07:48.880]  We have a two-way tie for first.
[07:50.320 --> 07:51.680]  Do you want to, like, wait a second?
[07:51.800 --> 07:52.400]  Do you want to, do you want to go?
[07:52.400 --> 07:53.820]  Well, how do you, how do you save?
[07:54.300 --> 07:54.780]  It's saved.
[07:54.940 --> 07:55.760]  He just has to quit.
[07:56.560 --> 07:58.740]  But do you want to just make sure that we're, like, locked in?
[07:59.320 --> 08:00.400]  Oh, I could go back to the balloon.
[08:02.200 --> 08:02.520]  OK.
[08:02.740 --> 08:04.100]  You want to see if I have the slot?
[08:04.680 --> 08:05.760]  Yeah, I think, I think, yeah.
[08:06.420 --> 08:08.560]  Yeah. So what what should we do going forward?
[08:08.640 --> 08:09.040]  Just quit?
[08:09.860 --> 08:10.640]  I think so.
[08:10.780 --> 08:10.960]  Just quit.
[08:10.960 --> 08:15.600]  I would have waited a few more seconds, but you know, he knows what he's doing.
[08:15.620 --> 08:17.240]  I waited until it said saved.
[08:17.640 --> 08:18.800]  OK. Oh, that's a good point.
[08:19.160 --> 08:20.760]  Hey, you got me there.
[08:20.920 --> 08:22.600]  There it is. There it is.
[08:22.680 --> 08:23.180]  All right.
[08:23.260 --> 08:23.940]  We did. All right.
[08:24.100 --> 08:24.580]  Successfully.
[08:24.660 --> 08:26.840]  We know that day one is in the books.
[08:27.460 --> 08:30.640]  Tune in every day in March.
[08:30.780 --> 08:34.040]  Patreon.com slash the regulation pod to watch this.
[08:34.380 --> 08:37.780]  And at the end, we will put these all into one
[08:37.780 --> 08:42.520]  30 turn Mario Party video that is going on our gameplay channel.
[08:42.620 --> 08:44.520]  So check it out.
[08:44.700 --> 08:45.600]  See you tomorrow.
[08:45.880 --> 08:47.460]  I guess tomorrow.
[08:47.580 --> 08:48.160]  Yeah.
[08:48.160 --> 08:48.980]  We'll see you on Sunday.
[08:49.440 --> 08:50.340]  All right.
[08:50.420 --> 08:51.080]  Bright and early.
[08:51.680 --> 08:52.720]  Bye. Bye.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.140]  Hey, hey, you guys.
[08:55.280 --> 08:57.540]  Hello and welcome to Mario Party.
[08:57.560 --> 08:58.960]  March day two.
[08:59.640 --> 09:02.080]  I really liked how day one went.
[09:02.160 --> 09:03.480]  How did you guys feel about it?
[09:03.700 --> 09:04.840]  I lost three fucking coins.
[09:07.240 --> 09:08.380]  Yeah, I like it.
[09:08.400 --> 09:12.300]  So instead of going to sleep, like I can't believe I lost Mario Party.
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.860]  It's like, oh, I landed on a red.
[09:15.880 --> 09:17.360]  Yeah, you landed on a green.
[09:17.440 --> 09:18.820]  I've been stressing about it all night.
[09:19.400 --> 09:20.080]  Barely sleep.
[09:21.440 --> 09:22.940]  Thinking about those bonus stars.
[09:24.540 --> 09:26.900]  I've been trying to think about Gavin's distance.
[09:28.060 --> 09:29.860]  Yeah, I know he's ahead.
[09:29.940 --> 09:30.600]  I don't know how far.
[09:31.180 --> 09:31.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.320]  OK, let's find out.
[09:33.780 --> 09:34.600]  I bet he's 11.
[09:34.920 --> 09:36.020]  I bet he's 11 away.
[09:36.140 --> 09:36.760]  I hope it's 11.
[09:37.140 --> 09:38.240]  I'm going to say nine.
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.160]  I don't even remember what sequence I'm in as far as what order we go in.
[09:42.580 --> 09:43.340]  First. I'm first.
[09:44.120 --> 09:45.580]  OK, so Mario's first.
[09:45.800 --> 09:46.740]  Yeah. All right, here we go.
[09:47.140 --> 09:49.280]  Let's see what we can do.
[09:49.560 --> 09:50.880]  So you're 19 to the star.
[09:52.380 --> 09:52.820]  Wow.
[09:53.540 --> 09:56.340]  Whoa, now that is a turn we're sleeping for.
[09:56.660 --> 09:57.020]  Wow.
[09:57.500 --> 09:58.860]  Oh, there's an item shop up here.
[09:58.920 --> 09:59.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:59.900 --> 10:01.720]  But so Gavin skipped the item shop.
[10:01.720 --> 10:03.340]  But here's the thing, like...
[10:03.340 --> 10:04.120]  There's a quad?
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.980]  Dude, this is crazy.
[10:06.320 --> 10:07.840]  But you only have 23 coins.
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.700]  Do you think spending now is going to be the move?
[10:09.740 --> 10:10.560]  But also, Gavin...
[10:10.560 --> 10:12.100]  I think it will be with a double here.
[10:12.140 --> 10:13.640]  But isn't Gavin like so ahead of you?
[10:14.580 --> 10:15.960]  No, I'm about to pass him.
[10:16.040 --> 10:16.860]  I'm about to pass him.
[10:18.040 --> 10:19.960]  He landed in this next section right here.
[10:20.340 --> 10:20.480]  OK.
[10:20.740 --> 10:23.940]  Now I'm nervous because I feel like there can't be more than two 10s in one turn.
[10:24.940 --> 10:26.020]  Nick is definitely going that way.
[10:27.580 --> 10:28.060]  All right.
[10:28.140 --> 10:28.400]  There you go.
[10:28.860 --> 10:29.640]  Back in the money game.
[10:29.760 --> 10:30.040]  Nick is nine away.
[10:31.100 --> 10:31.460]  Interesting.
[10:31.580 --> 10:32.900]  Very interesting turn, Nick.
[10:34.240 --> 10:34.600]  Three.
[10:34.840 --> 10:35.420]  He's rolling a three.
[10:35.620 --> 10:36.180]  I can feel it.
[10:36.280 --> 10:36.500]  It's a three.
[10:36.600 --> 10:37.440]  I think he's going three.
[10:37.760 --> 10:39.880]  I think he's rolling a six right here.
[10:39.900 --> 10:40.300]  It's a three.
[10:40.720 --> 10:42.280]  Oh, I think one in the red.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.440]  Oh, 24 hours later.
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.540]  One, one, one.
[10:45.860 --> 10:46.220]  No!
[10:48.240 --> 10:50.440]  Is that going to be our first start?
[10:50.680 --> 10:51.000]  Or is it?
[10:51.160 --> 10:52.080]  No, he's going to be too late.
[10:52.420 --> 10:54.000]  Oh, that's crazy.
[10:54.260 --> 10:58.960]  And it's going to land on an exclamation, which could be some sort of issue for me.
[10:58.960 --> 11:00.300]  Yeah, no, it'll be great.
[11:01.460 --> 11:01.940]  Wow.
[11:04.100 --> 11:05.540]  Oh, what is this?
[11:05.740 --> 11:06.240]  Back of the map.
[11:07.320 --> 11:08.880]  Oh, it's going to move us.
[11:09.040 --> 11:11.080]  No, Gavin, you fucked us both!
[11:11.400 --> 11:11.640]  No way!
[11:11.940 --> 11:12.300]  Yeah!
[11:13.440 --> 11:13.740]  No!
[11:14.360 --> 11:15.940]  Hey guys, that's me.
[11:16.760 --> 11:17.820]  You piece of shit.
[11:17.820 --> 11:19.140]  That's Eric chasing us.
[11:19.680 --> 11:19.820]  Yep.
[11:19.920 --> 11:20.700]  That's it, get out of here.
[11:20.780 --> 11:21.220]  Bye, Star.
[11:21.660 --> 11:22.140]  Wow.
[11:22.280 --> 11:22.620]  Gavin.
[11:23.060 --> 11:24.720]  Oh, they passed it.
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.940]  Dude, it is, it is day two and everything's different now.
[11:28.940 --> 11:30.840]  I was just copying you, Nick.
[11:30.900 --> 11:32.700]  You wrote a ten, I thought that was really nice.
[11:33.280 --> 11:36.300]  Everything was coming up, Mario, and you fucked me, Gavin.
[11:36.300 --> 11:37.160]  Can I keep the streak?
[11:37.580 --> 11:38.740]  They'll come!
[11:40.420 --> 11:42.400]  Half of it, I'll take it.
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.360]  Are you going to?
[11:43.480 --> 11:44.960]  Oh, you mean you got you got to spend now, right?
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.400]  I got to see what the items are.
[11:46.540 --> 11:47.640]  Let's see what these items do.
[11:47.680 --> 11:48.720]  I can't.
[11:48.860 --> 11:52.300]  Turbo dice, roll four dice and move at high speed.
[11:52.780 --> 11:53.440]  Wait, what did that say?
[11:53.480 --> 11:54.040]  Only what?
[11:55.220 --> 11:57.220]  We'll only stop for crossroads.
[11:57.500 --> 11:57.880]  Interesting.
[11:57.880 --> 12:01.360]  OK, so I could go past the star, I guess is the thought.
[12:01.660 --> 12:05.060]  Yep. I can't afford to do any of these.
[12:06.020 --> 12:10.440]  But you're going to be stopping so short that like you might as well spend low
[12:10.440 --> 12:13.760]  and like because the only person that's back there with you is Geoff.
[12:13.940 --> 12:14.860]  And Geoff has got no money.
[12:15.140 --> 12:16.940]  Geoff has seven coins.
[12:17.220 --> 12:18.460]  Buy the most expensive thing.
[12:18.960 --> 12:20.600]  OK, well, I don't know about that, but.
[12:20.780 --> 12:21.320]  No, do that.
[12:21.900 --> 12:22.640]  But yeah.
[12:23.760 --> 12:25.640]  Oh, my God, you did it.
[12:25.900 --> 12:27.520]  No, that's going to be useful for him.
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.980]  Yeah, I'm going to still have one above.
[12:30.280 --> 12:33.820]  So if he wins games, I should probably have seen where the.
[12:36.140 --> 12:38.380]  Oh, I just don't know why you did that.
[12:38.400 --> 12:39.160]  Well, now he can't.
[12:39.260 --> 12:41.440]  I just don't know why you did that.
[12:42.060 --> 12:43.940]  Gavin, you know, that was a miscalculation.
[12:44.420 --> 12:45.300]  What do we have to do?
[12:45.340 --> 12:47.420]  I'm going to convince him to win.
[12:47.700 --> 12:51.280]  OK, you know, to you.
[12:51.880 --> 12:53.140]  Hey, you launched.
[12:53.540 --> 12:54.520]  You're going to look at that.
[12:54.800 --> 12:55.940]  But now you skip the item shop.
[12:55.960 --> 12:57.140]  But it's OK because you only have seven.
[12:57.140 --> 12:58.920]  Yeah, it's not like I can buy anything anyway.
[12:59.180 --> 13:01.640]  Do you keep landing on stuff that doesn't give you coins?
[13:02.180 --> 13:03.340]  Keep I've only landed one.
[13:03.420 --> 13:04.600]  No, this is OK.
[13:04.620 --> 13:05.940]  This will give you coins. OK, cool.
[13:06.380 --> 13:07.980]  Well, I don't know because he landed on the green.
[13:08.020 --> 13:08.720]  Oh, you're right.
[13:10.440 --> 13:11.420]  Double the coins.
[13:11.680 --> 13:13.700]  Oh, yeah, I needed that.
[13:14.460 --> 13:18.140]  Oh, we got we know we have to do all the world.
[13:18.500 --> 13:20.720]  We got to kick this shit out of this one again.
[13:21.000 --> 13:21.440]  Off again.
[13:21.820 --> 13:22.460]  Oh, this is bad.
[13:22.660 --> 13:23.220]  Do this one.
[13:23.860 --> 13:25.700]  What is this one on again?
[13:26.520 --> 13:27.360]  Complexion could change.
[13:29.020 --> 13:31.140]  If if Andrew wins this,
[13:31.740 --> 13:34.280]  if Andrew wins this, he is poised to take a start.
[13:34.440 --> 13:35.180]  Oh, hold on.
[13:35.500 --> 13:39.380]  If he does not win this, if you guys take this from Andrew,
[13:39.640 --> 13:42.380]  I don't know, I didn't be able to afford to afford the start.
[13:42.880 --> 13:45.120]  All right, let's just get out of his way.
[13:45.160 --> 13:47.200]  Stay away. He can't kill a song.
[13:48.720 --> 13:50.640]  Oh, OK. Oh, way to go, Geoff.
[13:51.480 --> 13:52.820]  Motivation, Geoff.
[13:54.280 --> 13:55.820]  Oh, all right.
[13:55.880 --> 13:57.940]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, you guys.
[13:58.920 --> 14:00.680]  Oh, again, assholes.
[14:00.820 --> 14:01.740]  Dude, you guys.
[14:01.860 --> 14:03.260]  I didn't say anything to Geoff.
[14:03.380 --> 14:05.200]  Hey, Andrew, congratulations on that.
[14:05.200 --> 14:06.400]  Her back wins.
[14:06.880 --> 14:07.620]  Yeah, that's huge.
[14:08.060 --> 14:09.300]  That's Andrew for the mini games.
[14:09.580 --> 14:10.400]  Yeah, that's huge.
[14:10.920 --> 14:13.240]  We have to live with this the rest of the day.
[14:13.500 --> 14:14.540]  Yep. Yep. Andrew.
[14:14.920 --> 14:18.920]  Oh, and I said, oh, fuck off to first.
[14:19.020 --> 14:19.640]  That was outrageous.
[14:20.020 --> 14:21.000]  Definitely upset.
[14:21.640 --> 14:22.680]  And that'll do it.
[14:22.680 --> 14:26.540]  For Mario Party, that concludes day two.
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.480]  Wow. I am living the greatest life I possibly can in this game.
[14:31.580 --> 14:32.640]  Too many game wins.
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.740]  Most amount of coins I can have.
[14:34.860 --> 14:36.800]  I got a block. Oh, I'm feeling good.
[14:37.020 --> 14:38.540]  How's everyone feeling going into day three?
[14:38.980 --> 14:42.800]  Well, are you worried, Andrew, that having an early start is going to be an early target?
[14:43.720 --> 14:46.440]  I feel like I'm going to get targeted no matter what I do.
[14:46.580 --> 14:47.920]  So it doesn't really matter.
[14:48.360 --> 14:49.360]  I know where the boo is.
[14:50.400 --> 14:51.860]  Do you? Because I don't.
[14:51.860 --> 14:52.580]  See you soon.
[14:53.380 --> 14:54.580]  It's coming up for us, Gavin.
[14:54.940 --> 14:56.900]  Oh, shit. Oh, wow.
[14:57.100 --> 14:57.860]  Now you just...
[14:57.860 --> 15:00.880]  And they're ahead of me, so they could boo me, potentially.
[15:01.060 --> 15:02.420]  I don't know how far away it is.
[15:02.700 --> 15:03.820]  That would suck.
[15:04.420 --> 15:05.240]  Now I'm stressed.
[15:05.560 --> 15:07.760]  Now I'm stressed going into tomorrow because I don't know where that boo is.
[15:08.160 --> 15:09.100]  See you soon, monkey boy.
[15:09.580 --> 15:11.100]  Oh, no.
[15:12.140 --> 15:13.440]  Dilkong ain't sleeping tonight.
[15:13.740 --> 15:15.900]  OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.
[15:16.760 --> 15:18.740]  Here we go. It is day three.
[15:18.820 --> 15:19.900]  I'm going to get started, guys.
[15:20.000 --> 15:20.600]  I'm so excited.
[15:20.600 --> 15:22.480]  Wait, it's at three.
[15:22.540 --> 15:23.000]  I've been waiting.
[15:23.620 --> 15:24.180]  OK, day three.
[15:24.320 --> 15:27.160]  Andrew's very sure he's going to get a star, but it's Mario's turn.
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.380]  And Mario's going to play spoiler.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.860]  Wait, everybody has their shirts off, right?
[15:31.040 --> 15:32.000]  Mine's on. Yeah.
[15:32.140 --> 15:34.660]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[15:34.820 --> 15:36.220]  Where's this boo I keep hearing about?
[15:36.900 --> 15:38.640]  Eric, you sound extra morningy.
[15:38.780 --> 15:40.460]  No! I'm going to sleep.
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.460]  No! What could I possibly do here?
[15:45.300 --> 15:46.120]  Oh, no.
[15:47.320 --> 15:48.940]  Oh, no.
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.060]  Get away! Get away!
[15:53.500 --> 15:55.620]  I'm going to get a star today! Get away!
[15:56.100 --> 15:58.320]  I'm going to get a star! Get away!
[15:59.300 --> 16:01.680]  No! Fifteen!
[16:02.360 --> 16:03.640]  Oh, that's so many.
[16:04.420 --> 16:05.180]  Oh, no.
[16:05.500 --> 16:07.400]  Nick's going to get a star today.
[16:07.760 --> 16:09.840]  Oh, dear. Today?
[16:10.420 --> 16:11.580]  What the fuck?
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.200]  Maybe in three days.
[16:13.460 --> 16:14.200]  Andrew, what happened?
[16:15.120 --> 16:17.740]  I said the boo is...
[16:17.740 --> 16:19.980]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[16:20.020 --> 16:20.920]  He got spooked.
[16:21.760 --> 16:23.700]  Less than... What was that? Five?
[16:23.940 --> 16:25.640]  Less than... Thank God.
[16:26.820 --> 16:27.740]  Uh-oh.
[16:29.880 --> 16:31.720]  I'm only landed on green.
[16:32.140 --> 16:32.660]  Every time.
[16:33.160 --> 16:34.820]  Three for three on green.
[16:34.900 --> 16:35.560]  What's going on?
[16:36.020 --> 16:37.400]  You just skipped boo, too.
[16:37.520 --> 16:38.400]  You just skipped boo.
[16:38.440 --> 16:39.260]  Damn it.
[16:41.380 --> 16:41.860]  Sausages.
[16:42.240 --> 16:43.520]  All right. All right.
[16:43.620 --> 16:44.620]  Here comes your bop.
[16:44.800 --> 16:45.880]  All right, Geoff, are you ready?
[16:45.960 --> 16:46.800]  He's going to get a star.
[16:46.800 --> 16:48.460]  No, I'm going to let it away.
[16:48.800 --> 16:50.360]  I didn't have a chance anyway.
[16:50.960 --> 16:52.180]  Oh, he wasn't going to get a star anyway.
[16:52.380 --> 16:54.000]  Oh, so you're not going to get a star today.
[16:54.240 --> 16:55.160]  Oh, so tomorrow is your day.
[16:55.240 --> 16:57.720]  I'm not. OK, so three...
[16:57.720 --> 16:58.680]  Just take the lower... Three is bad.
[16:58.920 --> 16:59.920]  Just take the lower road.
[17:00.900 --> 17:01.260]  Yeah.
[17:02.180 --> 17:03.060]  Three and nine... We'll take the high road.
[17:03.060 --> 17:03.880]  You take the low road.
[17:04.180 --> 17:04.260]  Yeah.
[17:04.780 --> 17:05.720]  We'll see who gets it the fastest.
[17:05.960 --> 17:07.800]  Land on a Bowser to try to get the Bowser star.
[17:08.320 --> 17:08.660]  Yeah. Yeah.
[17:08.960 --> 17:10.100]  I'm going to...
[17:10.700 --> 17:12.700]  You think Bowser is your ally?
[17:13.700 --> 17:14.580]  Sorry, that was before we were recording.
[17:14.580 --> 17:16.220]  Anything but a three or a nine.
[17:17.440 --> 17:19.000]  Whoo! Split the difference.
[17:19.300 --> 17:19.800]  OK, anything...
[17:19.800 --> 17:22.500]  Man, without the context of the last 15 minutes of us being together,
[17:22.600 --> 17:24.580]  the audience is going to be like, where'd the Bane voice come from?
[17:24.660 --> 17:24.960]  No!
[17:26.340 --> 17:28.120]  Wait, what do you mean no? It's good.
[17:28.660 --> 17:29.520]  Do I have to use it?
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.020]  You're fine.
[17:30.900 --> 17:32.320]  No, you don't have to use it.
[17:33.740 --> 17:34.100]  Oh...
[17:34.100 --> 17:35.980]  OK, you can make someone starchy.
[17:36.380 --> 17:38.800]  I thought it was going to add more to my score.
[17:38.940 --> 17:40.340]  I thought I was going to go past the star.
[17:40.680 --> 17:41.660]  Oh, let's see.
[17:41.660 --> 17:44.720]  I don't have money or enough dice to get there.
[17:45.640 --> 17:46.420]  I'll go three.
[17:46.980 --> 17:47.940]  Let's just have some fun.
[17:47.940 --> 17:49.540]  I'm just a happy little mole.
[17:50.940 --> 17:53.160]  I mean, he's going blue either way.
[17:53.580 --> 17:55.080]  Boop! Take my three coins back, thanks.
[17:55.260 --> 17:56.000]  Om nom nom nom nom nom.
[17:56.980 --> 17:57.500]  All right.
[17:57.860 --> 17:58.960]  I think you're supposed to eat the coins.
[17:59.200 --> 17:59.720]  We got another...
[17:59.720 --> 18:01.460]  Where else am I going to put them, Gavin? I don't have pockets.
[18:01.740 --> 18:02.340]  I'm not wearing clothes.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.080]  He's a mole, for God's sake.
[18:04.740 --> 18:06.200]  Those anuses is where they come out.
[18:06.660 --> 18:06.880]  Moles?
[18:07.780 --> 18:08.920]  What holes are you sticking them in?
[18:08.920 --> 18:11.440]  I put it in my mouth hole and then I'm going to shit it out my butthole
[18:11.440 --> 18:12.260]  when I buy a star.
[18:12.680 --> 18:15.080]  If this was Achievement Hunter, if this was Achievement Hunter,
[18:15.280 --> 18:17.540]  moles have holes would be a shirt right now.
[18:17.660 --> 18:18.500]  Immediately a shirt.
[18:19.340 --> 18:20.040]  Andrew cannot win.
[18:20.440 --> 18:21.700]  This is going to be some shaking.
[18:22.040 --> 18:23.980]  No, it's too early for this.
[18:24.220 --> 18:24.900]  Andrew cannot win.
[18:26.460 --> 18:27.960]  That is the one rule, gentlemen.
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.480]  Dilkong must die.
[18:32.340 --> 18:34.100]  Hang on, I'm trying to figure out what's the stat in my room
[18:34.100 --> 18:35.180]  so that it goes through the wall well.
[18:35.320 --> 18:35.640]  OK, yeah.
[18:36.120 --> 18:36.880]  Wait, what?
[18:36.960 --> 18:37.800]  Oh, that's right.
[18:37.880 --> 18:39.060]  Your shit's all like next door.
[18:40.540 --> 18:42.920]  His his his computer equipment is his roommate.
[18:43.160 --> 18:46.200]  Yep. Ready? Go, go, go, go, go.
[18:46.820 --> 18:50.400]  Dilkong. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[18:50.700 --> 18:51.180]  Mario.
[18:52.020 --> 18:53.500]  Let's go, baby, come on.
[18:53.840 --> 18:54.740]  Come on.
[18:54.900 --> 18:55.700]  Come on, Jack.
[18:56.360 --> 18:59.060]  Fuck. Shit. Shit.
[18:59.760 --> 19:01.440]  This ball just blew out my eye.
[19:01.480 --> 19:03.040]  My shoulder is so sore.
[19:03.180 --> 19:04.340]  Such a boring workout.
[19:04.700 --> 19:06.580]  Nick has got those wanking muscles.
[19:06.580 --> 19:09.380]  I just threw out my shoulder for the rest of the game.
[19:09.880 --> 19:12.620]  Well, luckily, you have 24 hours to recover.
[19:13.020 --> 19:14.640]  Yeah, I'm going to put the icy hot on.
[19:14.800 --> 19:15.880]  How many coins did I get from that?
[19:16.040 --> 19:17.120]  That was turn three.
[19:17.780 --> 19:18.940]  That was turn three.
[19:19.200 --> 19:19.860]  No star.
[19:20.900 --> 19:21.840]  Yes, Andrew, what happened?
[19:22.460 --> 19:23.620]  Yeah, where'd your star go, Andrew?
[19:24.220 --> 19:27.000]  There won't be one tomorrow either.
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.060]  I'd say turn three was like a backwards for you.
[19:31.180 --> 19:32.480]  You have less money and no star.
[19:32.880 --> 19:35.780]  Now, before we get because we got to stop because no more turn.
[19:35.780 --> 19:39.160]  I just want to I want to take sort of a temperature read from Andrew
[19:39.160 --> 19:40.980]  because he came in going, I'm going to get a star.
[19:41.260 --> 19:42.280]  I'm feeling great.
[19:42.520 --> 19:44.860]  Andrew, you're at 16 coins.
[19:45.180 --> 19:48.340]  So now you have 24 hours to think about how you're going to try to move
[19:48.340 --> 19:52.000]  three spaces to get a star without the amount of coins you need.
[19:52.780 --> 19:56.860]  Well, I'm going to get three coins when I land on a blue space.
[19:56.960 --> 19:57.840]  That'll put you at 19.
[19:58.240 --> 20:02.440]  So then I'll need to place at least third, I think, in the next mini game.
[20:03.010 --> 20:05.760]  And then I could get a star the following turn.
[20:06.200 --> 20:09.400]  We're looking at turn five for my first star.
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.520]  How does it feel to go into turn three knowing you were going to get a star
[20:14.520 --> 20:18.960]  and to in turn three, hoping turn five will be your next opportunity?
[20:19.340 --> 20:21.420]  It's a it's a blow for sure.
[20:22.240 --> 20:27.400]  As long as you don't win the next mini game and go past me.
[20:28.160 --> 20:29.140]  I'm feeling good.
[20:29.580 --> 20:31.980]  Oh, I think that you're probably in pretty good shape then.
[20:31.980 --> 20:34.840]  Yeah, I feel pretty confident about my chances overall.
[20:35.860 --> 20:38.720]  Now that now that you lay it out like that, your future does seem a little brighter.
[20:38.740 --> 20:40.180]  This is Mario Party.
[20:40.540 --> 20:44.420]  So maybe there's somehow this will turn into a 2v2 and then I can get fucked.
[20:44.620 --> 20:46.880]  There's so many ways that I can get screwed out of the star.
[20:47.120 --> 20:51.580]  But I'm believing turn five first star going to the deal.
[20:51.640 --> 20:54.960]  All right. We'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.
[20:55.960 --> 20:58.280]  Welcome back. It's Mario Party and it's day.
[20:58.440 --> 21:00.260]  Nick, what day is it? Four, turn four.
[21:00.260 --> 21:04.080]  That's because it's turn four and we're ready to get going.
[21:04.200 --> 21:06.220]  Who will get the star?
[21:06.580 --> 21:10.160]  Andrew was texting us late at night, letting us know that he's been thinking
[21:10.160 --> 21:11.460]  about it all day long.
[21:12.100 --> 21:13.900]  So, Mario, let's get it started.
[21:14.240 --> 21:16.040]  Let's go. Ready?
[21:16.180 --> 21:18.380]  Well, I'm not getting the star this turn, but next turn.
[21:18.740 --> 21:20.360]  I'm employing a new technique today.
[21:20.880 --> 21:23.160]  I haven't yet. Oh, no.
[21:25.620 --> 21:26.920]  Was this your technique?
[21:27.440 --> 21:29.780]  Yeah, the technique is Nick hits Bowser immediately.
[21:30.720 --> 21:33.980]  I love my technique was that I've not yet gone for my morning poo.
[21:34.120 --> 21:36.140]  So I'm hoping it sort of amps me up for the.
[21:36.220 --> 21:37.540]  Oh, OK. For the mini game.
[21:37.640 --> 21:39.000]  I wish I could say the same.
[21:39.080 --> 21:41.000]  Well, as long as it's not Bowser Revolution.
[21:41.140 --> 21:42.700]  No, Nick.
[21:43.920 --> 21:45.160]  Andrew's coins are mine.
[21:45.360 --> 21:47.960]  Yeah, he's still got enough to buy that star from Andrew, though.
[21:48.160 --> 21:49.020]  Yeah, don't worry about it.
[21:50.860 --> 21:54.920]  We found out that Boo lives in a tree and I'm feeling good about this.
[21:55.080 --> 21:59.160]  I missed Boo yesterday and now I'm somewhere else, I believe.
[21:59.160 --> 22:00.440]  You're now you're you're up ahead.
[22:00.580 --> 22:02.540]  You can you can cause a double Bowser here.
[22:02.880 --> 22:06.260]  Yeah. As long as we don't redistribute the wealth, we're OK.
[22:07.220 --> 22:09.380]  Let me have a quick look at the board just to get some little
[22:09.380 --> 22:11.120]  little bit of context for this video.
[22:11.380 --> 22:12.380]  OK, what do I want?
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.020]  I want I want it just says Gavin is viewing the board.
[22:16.120 --> 22:18.060]  It's not only context that you have.
[22:18.180 --> 22:19.500]  OK, sorry about that.
[22:20.060 --> 22:21.300]  Context just for me.
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.940]  I need to. I'm not accepted.
[22:23.460 --> 22:26.680]  I need a two, a three or a four for something interesting to happen.
[22:27.340 --> 22:28.780]  Two, three or four. OK.
[22:29.400 --> 22:31.160]  That's ensuring I don't want any of those.
[22:31.660 --> 22:32.620]  Are you that close to Bowser?
[22:34.020 --> 22:35.460]  Yes. OK.
[22:36.640 --> 22:38.860]  Now, let's check this out.
[22:39.100 --> 22:40.160]  Let's see how the Mario.
[22:40.420 --> 22:41.320]  No, no, no, no, no.
[22:41.320 --> 22:43.860]  Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
[22:44.440 --> 22:45.280]  Oh, yeah.
[22:47.500 --> 22:49.200]  Scoot on past that Bowser.
[22:49.500 --> 22:51.060]  OK, what's the luck thing?
[22:51.340 --> 22:52.700]  Do I pit lane? What's this about?
[22:52.860 --> 22:54.940]  Vino 3 is thinking there's a first.
[22:55.300 --> 22:56.220]  Which way are you going to go?
[22:57.340 --> 22:58.420]  What was the difference?
[22:58.560 --> 23:00.040]  It was days ago. What happens?
[23:00.460 --> 23:01.500]  I don't know. I don't remember.
[23:02.280 --> 23:02.740]  Pick one.
[23:03.440 --> 23:04.080]  Oh, why'd you pick?
[23:04.080 --> 23:05.900]  You get money for passing go, but I don't know if this.
[23:06.040 --> 23:07.520]  Oh, that seems all like good stuff.
[23:08.440 --> 23:09.680]  Yeah, I'll have some of this.
[23:11.160 --> 23:12.060]  Oh, wow.
[23:12.360 --> 23:13.440]  Trap in the pit lane.
[23:14.160 --> 23:15.400]  Yeah, I'll trap up the pits.
[23:15.880 --> 23:16.600]  It's fucked up.
[23:17.700 --> 23:18.420]  All right, Dilkong.
[23:18.500 --> 23:20.040]  Oh, boy. OK.
[23:20.820 --> 23:22.120]  All right, you got Dilkong.
[23:22.280 --> 23:23.100]  That's my first blue.
[23:23.220 --> 23:24.560]  Let's look at the board for a second.
[23:24.560 --> 23:26.820]  Yeah, your first non green.
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.640]  So I'm really worried.
[23:30.800 --> 23:32.840]  So that my situation is Geoff can fuck me.
[23:33.160 --> 23:34.160]  Yeah, I'd like to.
[23:34.460 --> 23:37.260]  Yeah. Oh, let's.
[23:37.520 --> 23:38.560]  You need to roll low, buddy.
[23:39.820 --> 23:41.160]  I'm doing he's going to force him.
[23:41.420 --> 23:44.440]  Can you use what doesn't the other block, the goopy block?
[23:44.560 --> 23:45.840]  Oh, never mind. You're doing great.
[23:45.920 --> 23:46.720]  Lower somebody else.
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.360]  It won't work for you.
[23:48.720 --> 23:49.840]  No, no.
[23:50.300 --> 23:52.640]  But he can select exactly what he rolls on this.
[23:52.640 --> 23:55.440]  OK, I'm going to take negative coins.
[23:56.320 --> 23:57.120]  OK, why?
[23:58.500 --> 23:59.660]  To be on a team with me.
[24:01.240 --> 24:02.280]  Why would you rest assured?
[24:02.500 --> 24:04.180]  Why would you do that instead of just rolling to?
[24:06.620 --> 24:11.140]  Ah, you know, you could have picked any number and you picked a bad losing
[24:11.140 --> 24:13.100]  additional coinage here, are you?
[24:14.060 --> 24:15.900]  Hope you understand why you wanted to do that.
[24:16.060 --> 24:17.260]  So confused. Why did you?
[24:17.580 --> 24:18.740]  OK, OK.
[24:18.860 --> 24:20.080]  Why did you do that process?
[24:20.260 --> 24:22.420]  If I hit green, I get shoved away
[24:22.420 --> 24:25.820]  from the stars where Geoff is, but I wanted to be one space away.
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.140]  So that wasn't even a possibility next turn, except I didn't factor in.
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.680]  But you have the coins.
[24:30.840 --> 24:31.880]  The coins was a mistake.
[24:32.040 --> 24:33.460]  OK, that's fine.
[24:35.600 --> 24:36.780]  One damn. Damn.
[24:36.900 --> 24:39.120]  No, please tell me he lands on the OK.
[24:41.940 --> 24:43.140]  Oh, I am.
[24:43.460 --> 24:44.640]  Oh, shit.
[24:45.080 --> 24:46.300]  Oh, oh, it's for him.
[24:46.520 --> 24:47.420]  Just him. Little mini.
[24:47.460 --> 24:47.900]  I don't know.
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.120]  We'll find out.
[24:49.220 --> 24:50.740]  They'll be like, follow the pig or something.
[24:50.880 --> 24:51.940]  Oh, it's blinking.
[24:51.940 --> 24:54.000]  Yeah, it's going to be like, follow the pig this last night.
[24:55.340 --> 24:57.200]  What? I did this last night practicing.
[24:58.400 --> 24:59.280]  This is what we did.
[24:59.420 --> 25:03.080]  Yeah, we we practiced for it last night at a game game on.
[25:04.020 --> 25:05.440]  Oh, we did that live action
[25:07.600 --> 25:08.940]  game, game show thing.
[25:09.140 --> 25:10.700]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Oh, yeah. How was it?
[25:10.760 --> 25:11.380]  It's great. Awesome.
[25:11.580 --> 25:12.540]  It was so much fun.
[25:12.680 --> 25:14.140]  It was so much cooler than I thought it would be.
[25:15.740 --> 25:16.060]  Yes.
[25:17.840 --> 25:19.160]  I know what I must do.
[25:21.400 --> 25:22.400]  What do you want to do, Nick?
[25:23.400 --> 25:24.340]  I want to.
[25:24.840 --> 25:26.380]  You don't forget about bonus stars, Nick.
[25:26.420 --> 25:28.220]  All right, buddy. Oh, bonus stars.
[25:28.320 --> 25:29.800]  Damn. Just like the old days.
[25:30.180 --> 25:32.000]  And again, the medium days in the today days.
[25:32.120 --> 25:34.480]  Me and you, Nick, we got to do this.
[25:34.740 --> 25:37.280]  Nick is on the same team as Andrew, and he's going to throw this whole thing.
[25:37.800 --> 25:38.580]  No, no, no, no, no.
[25:38.700 --> 25:39.660]  He's thinking about it.
[25:39.900 --> 25:42.180]  Oh, this is they might not have to throw it.
[25:42.240 --> 25:43.700]  I've never seen this one before.
[25:43.700 --> 25:44.420]  I've never played this game.
[25:44.620 --> 25:45.640]  They might not have to throw it.
[25:45.660 --> 25:47.940]  I think just maybe I'm just going to fucking a big style.
[25:48.520 --> 25:50.260]  I think I'm going to fucking a big style.
[25:51.340 --> 25:52.680]  I'm a memory guy.
[25:53.580 --> 25:54.580]  This is so exciting.
[25:54.720 --> 25:56.180]  I got a fucking elephant brain.
[25:56.380 --> 25:58.440]  OK, I don't think we'd even need a system, Geoff.
[25:58.480 --> 25:59.640]  We're just going to figure this out.
[25:59.640 --> 26:01.060]  All right, I'm going to go top left.
[26:01.540 --> 26:02.720]  OK, OK, learning.
[26:03.380 --> 26:04.900]  OK, I'm going to get the fish.
[26:05.220 --> 26:06.160]  There it is.
[26:06.200 --> 26:07.140]  Wow. Neck and neck.
[26:08.060 --> 26:08.660]  Here we go.
[26:09.020 --> 26:09.960]  We're slightly ahead, Nick.
[26:10.520 --> 26:11.460]  Yeah, just barely.
[26:11.760 --> 26:12.720]  OK, OK.
[26:12.780 --> 26:14.220]  Oh, Geoff was not doing anything.
[26:15.100 --> 26:15.800]  There we go.
[26:16.360 --> 26:17.440]  Yeah, keep going, Nick.
[26:18.300 --> 26:18.740]  Top right.
[26:20.100 --> 26:20.980]  Top right, top left.
[26:21.620 --> 26:21.940]  OK.
[26:23.080 --> 26:23.860]  Get it, get it, get it.
[26:23.920 --> 26:24.320]  Yeah, we got it.
[26:25.140 --> 26:26.260]  OK, OK, we're different.
[26:27.640 --> 26:28.280]  This is...
[26:28.280 --> 26:29.340]  Bottom right, bottom right, bottom right.
[26:30.240 --> 26:31.860]  I don't know why I trusted this.
[26:31.880 --> 26:33.000]  Top left, top left, top left.
[26:34.160 --> 26:35.360]  Oh, you're going to get the middle, middle, middle.
[26:35.580 --> 26:37.940]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[26:38.680 --> 26:39.660]  OK, all right, we got this.
[26:39.840 --> 26:40.680]  Top left, nope.
[26:41.240 --> 26:41.840]  We'll catch it up.
[26:43.420 --> 26:44.900]  Oh, it's Mecha Cooper, like Mecha Nick.
[26:44.900 --> 26:45.080]  Wait.
[26:46.080 --> 26:47.200]  I think it's top...
[26:47.200 --> 26:47.360]  No.
[26:47.960 --> 26:48.660]  Where, where, where?
[26:48.940 --> 26:50.180]  Oh, did Gavin give up?
[26:51.240 --> 26:52.880]  Gavin just gave up.
[26:52.900 --> 26:53.940]  I forgot a whole lot, thanks, Nick.
[26:53.940 --> 26:56.360]  I want everyone to watch where Gavin just stood there.
[26:56.780 --> 26:57.960]  I couldn't move.
[26:58.800 --> 26:59.680]  21 coins.
[26:59.880 --> 27:02.480]  The same thing happened to me when you said,
[27:02.620 --> 27:04.500]  Geoff's not going, I just wouldn't move for a second.
[27:04.660 --> 27:06.520]  I was like stuck in glue or something.
[27:07.040 --> 27:07.600]  Yeah, I had the same problem.
[27:07.600 --> 27:09.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were stuck in glue.
[27:09.880 --> 27:12.640]  Did they do like a game glue somehow?
[27:12.640 --> 27:14.820]  Yeah, they did a game glue.
[27:14.820 --> 27:16.600]  Yeah, dude, they did a game glue.
[27:16.760 --> 27:19.020]  All right, that's the end of turn four.
[27:19.200 --> 27:20.760]  A lot of mini games, a lot of implications.
[27:21.120 --> 27:21.360]  Oh.
[27:22.780 --> 27:23.540]  Tomorrow's party.
[27:24.920 --> 27:26.700]  Got a jamboree buddy coming in.
[27:27.340 --> 27:29.580]  Maybe next time we'll glue trap them, Gavin.
[27:31.000 --> 27:31.820]  Oh, you know what?
[27:32.320 --> 27:34.060]  Did he appear after the save?
[27:35.160 --> 27:35.720]  Oh, maybe.
[27:35.860 --> 27:36.520]  Yeah, I think he did.
[27:36.660 --> 27:40.020]  Oh, I wonder if it'll be him tomorrow, whether it will reload to before he came.
[27:40.080 --> 27:41.060]  It'll be someone else.
[27:41.060 --> 27:43.480]  Oh, well, there's only one way to find out.
[27:43.640 --> 27:46.440]  And that's by tuning in tomorrow, because we'll see you next time.
[27:47.020 --> 27:47.460]  Bye.
[27:48.480 --> 27:48.920]  Bye.
[27:49.100 --> 27:49.540]  Bye.
[27:49.620 --> 27:49.900]  Bye.
[27:50.860 --> 27:53.000]  Guys, it's the third day, it's the day.
[27:54.260 --> 27:55.100]  I'm getting a star.
[27:55.580 --> 27:56.480]  Oh, it's Rosalina.
[27:57.080 --> 27:58.220]  Wait, it changed.
[27:58.860 --> 27:59.980]  And she's behind us.
[28:00.100 --> 28:01.700]  Bowser Jr. became Rosalina.
[28:01.900 --> 28:02.740]  Oh, my God.
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.920]  And she's in the bad spot for us.
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.220]  Who the fuck is Rosalina?
[28:06.580 --> 28:08.260]  I think she's from the GameCube ones.
[28:08.440 --> 28:09.140]  She's from Galaxy.
[28:09.400 --> 28:10.740]  Galaxy, that's what it is.
[28:10.740 --> 28:11.620]  Oh, okay.
[28:12.120 --> 28:13.700]  Guys, I have to admit something to you.
[28:14.060 --> 28:14.180]  Yeah?
[28:14.260 --> 28:19.120]  I felt underwhelmed by my performance yesterday, and I couldn't figure out why.
[28:19.220 --> 28:19.760]  And then it hit me.
[28:19.860 --> 28:20.880]  I had my shirt on the whole time.
[28:20.880 --> 28:21.640]  Oh, you had your shirt, yeah.
[28:22.180 --> 28:23.960]  So my shirt's popped back off, don't worry.
[28:24.060 --> 28:24.560]  I'll be 100% with it.
[28:24.680 --> 28:25.300]  I'm glad.
[28:25.660 --> 28:26.540]  All right, Mario time.
[28:26.640 --> 28:27.080]  Let's go, Mario.
[28:28.280 --> 28:28.700]  Let's do this.
[28:28.880 --> 28:29.720]  I'm getting a star today.
[28:29.880 --> 28:33.500]  I sent you all a gift, so you could celebrate along with me today.
[28:33.880 --> 28:34.340]  Not all.
[28:34.740 --> 28:35.920]  To be clear, not all.
[28:36.060 --> 28:36.420]  What a waste.
[28:36.420 --> 28:39.880]  Well, I don't have your address, and Nick's, uh, they didn't have it at his store.
[28:39.880 --> 28:41.060]  So I got a refund on that one.
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.700]  Now, can I ask you a question about the gift, Andrew?
[28:43.900 --> 28:44.020]  Yeah, of course.
[28:44.020 --> 28:45.800]  You sent us star balloons?
[28:46.200 --> 28:46.400]  Yep.
[28:47.180 --> 28:48.680]  Was it supposed to be blown up?
[28:48.820 --> 28:51.020]  Yeah, I paid for inflated for yours.
[28:51.180 --> 28:52.180]  Gavin's was inflated.
[28:52.300 --> 28:53.680]  I don't know why yours wasn't.
[28:53.900 --> 28:55.560]  Mine was definitely not inflated.
[28:55.700 --> 28:59.060]  Yeah, I was actually worried that they didn't have a weight, and that the person was just
[28:59.060 --> 29:02.900]  holding an inflated balloon outside your door, being like, I need you to get this.
[29:03.240 --> 29:05.140]  I am, but it wasn't the case.
[29:05.660 --> 29:09.780]  I just assumed you gave it to us hoping we would inflate it really quickly and get light-headed.
[29:10.440 --> 29:10.760]  Yeah.
[29:11.700 --> 29:15.100]  No, it's a celebration because today's the first star day.
[29:15.780 --> 29:17.040]  Gavin, no one's going to go that way.
[29:17.480 --> 29:18.260]  No one will go that way?
[29:18.500 --> 29:18.780]  They'll just go to the end lane.
[29:19.100 --> 29:19.960]  No, they'll go to the end lane.
[29:20.420 --> 29:21.140]  You just went that way.
[29:21.260 --> 29:22.420]  You just went that way.
[29:22.680 --> 29:24.980]  Right, but now that that's there, I'm not going to go that way.
[29:25.180 --> 29:26.540]  Oh, don't worry, I've got another one.
[29:27.700 --> 29:28.240]  Oh, wait, no, I don't.
[29:28.340 --> 29:28.900]  Nick's insane.
[29:30.080 --> 29:31.060]  No, what do you mean?
[29:31.940 --> 29:33.680]  He's put it at a fork in the road.
[29:33.740 --> 29:35.940]  You can literally avoid it at any time.
[29:36.280 --> 29:38.200]  Well, sometimes you might not want to go in the middle lane.
[29:41.820 --> 29:46.940]  Everybody says, I was reading comments, they say this is a turd level and we should be playing on the stuff we haven't unlocked yet.
[29:47.040 --> 29:48.480]  But what do you have to do to unlock it?
[29:49.180 --> 29:50.360]  You have to play it a bunch.
[29:51.000 --> 29:51.980]  Is it really a turd level?
[29:52.680 --> 29:54.540]  I'm enjoying it. I'm having a blast.
[29:54.840 --> 29:58.660]  I think there's a lot of opportunity for you guys to run into each other.
[29:58.800 --> 30:05.220]  But if a couple people in the audience said that we shouldn't do this, we should just pack this in day five and just call it quits.
[30:05.220 --> 30:08.480]  If this is a turd level though, here's the beauty of it.
[30:08.520 --> 30:10.520]  This is the worst this will ever be.
[30:10.560 --> 30:10.840]  What?
[30:11.400 --> 30:12.180]  That's true.
[30:12.300 --> 30:12.660]  Wow.
[30:13.120 --> 30:13.760]  Better level.
[30:13.980 --> 30:16.080]  Gavin, he's just doing things.
[30:16.080 --> 30:16.980]  What the fuck?
[30:17.160 --> 30:18.520]  I went to the outside.
[30:18.980 --> 30:19.280]  Jesus Christ, dude.
[30:20.520 --> 30:22.380]  I'm having fun on this level so far.
[30:23.640 --> 30:24.580]  Oh, a green.
[30:25.720 --> 30:27.080]  What does this do?
[30:27.280 --> 30:27.940]  I don't know.
[30:28.840 --> 30:29.740]  Time to swap.
[30:30.060 --> 30:30.660]  What are we swapping?
[30:30.780 --> 30:31.100]  Swap what?
[30:31.640 --> 30:32.100]  Am I out?
[30:32.340 --> 30:32.860]  Is Eric in?
[30:32.860 --> 30:35.260]  Why is he filling up?
[30:36.240 --> 30:37.580]  Are you about to fly?
[30:38.020 --> 30:38.400]  What happened?
[30:38.860 --> 30:40.600]  How is this gonna screw me in some way?
[30:41.220 --> 30:41.500]  What?
[30:41.640 --> 30:42.140]  What's happening?
[30:42.240 --> 30:42.960]  I wrecked the map.
[30:43.320 --> 30:44.760]  It's evil tone.
[30:46.220 --> 30:46.660]  What?
[30:48.780 --> 30:52.740]  Jump pads and item shops have been swapped until the end of the next turn.
[30:53.420 --> 30:59.640]  I'm kind of blown away at how much the audience is loving this because in real life, it's like blue ballsing yourself every morning.
[30:59.900 --> 31:00.780]  It's the worst.
[31:01.040 --> 31:02.260]  I think that's what they like about it.
[31:02.260 --> 31:03.420]  Let's look at the board.
[31:04.400 --> 31:05.740]  Yeah, we gotta look at the board.
[31:05.880 --> 31:07.540]  Oh yeah, let's do the thing that no one can see.
[31:07.940 --> 31:08.140]  Good call.
[31:08.220 --> 31:09.120]  Oh, don't worry.
[31:09.520 --> 31:10.420]  Nick will do it at the end.
[31:11.100 --> 31:11.860]  Yeah, I'll do it at the end.
[31:11.940 --> 31:14.800]  He's just having a look at where the star is.
[31:15.460 --> 31:16.980]  It's right in front of me, which is nice.
[31:17.100 --> 31:18.320]  Let me get out of the screen.
[31:18.400 --> 31:18.820]  Here we go.
[31:18.900 --> 31:19.880]  First star.
[31:20.400 --> 31:21.840]  Get my dice block.
[31:23.580 --> 31:25.680]  Oh, it's a Dilkong star day.
[31:25.820 --> 31:26.700]  First star.
[31:27.360 --> 31:28.600]  How excited have you been all night?
[31:29.660 --> 31:30.120]  Here we go.
[31:30.880 --> 31:32.520]  I should have threw the game last time.
[31:34.120 --> 31:35.260]  Oh, it's mine.
[31:35.360 --> 31:36.280]  The star is all mine.
[31:36.380 --> 31:36.920]  Thank you.
[31:37.040 --> 31:38.440]  Yeah, you gave that to him, Nick.
[31:38.620 --> 31:38.940]  Yep.
[31:39.020 --> 31:40.660]  That's a gift for Andrew.
[31:41.040 --> 31:41.540]  From fourth to...
[31:41.540 --> 31:42.080]  It's gonna make it.
[31:42.780 --> 31:43.180]  First?
[31:43.540 --> 31:44.400]  So, congratulations.
[31:45.720 --> 31:46.420]  Big smile.
[31:46.840 --> 31:48.100]  Oh, congrats to me.
[31:48.500 --> 31:50.140]  You know, I'm not sure if you're gonna steal that.
[31:51.260 --> 31:53.480]  There's so much game left, so I'm still happy for you.
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.460]  I'm so excited.
[31:54.460 --> 31:57.200]  Oh, the next star is where I think Andrew cannot get it.
[31:57.600 --> 31:58.480]  He can't, no.
[31:58.680 --> 31:59.180]  He has to loop.
[31:59.180 --> 31:59.920]  Enter track.
[32:00.240 --> 32:00.680]  Yep.
[32:01.560 --> 32:02.800]  Oh, give me this.
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.020]  Oh, good.
[32:04.220 --> 32:04.520]  Nice.
[32:05.260 --> 32:05.700]  All right.
[32:05.740 --> 32:07.280]  First time Dice Rolled and moved to the total amount.
[32:09.840 --> 32:10.500]  All right.
[32:10.800 --> 32:11.680]  Monty gold.
[32:11.840 --> 32:13.120]  Time to make Geoff also made it big.
[32:13.200 --> 32:13.820]  Let's go, Geoff.
[32:14.440 --> 32:15.360]  We'll do this.
[32:15.720 --> 32:16.300]  Where you going, Monty?
[32:16.300 --> 32:16.880]  Time to do it big style.
[32:19.020 --> 32:19.460]  Eight.
[32:22.040 --> 32:25.440]  Hey, lucky space.
[32:26.100 --> 32:26.680]  All right.
[32:26.800 --> 32:27.400]  You got some money.
[32:27.400 --> 32:28.260]  That's exactly what I wanted.
[32:28.780 --> 32:29.220]  Let's see.
[32:29.960 --> 32:31.380]  What's a creepy dice block?
[32:31.400 --> 32:32.440]  Let's find out.
[32:32.740 --> 32:32.900]  Nope.
[32:33.000 --> 32:33.220]  Almost.
[32:33.880 --> 32:34.580]  I'll take it.
[32:34.940 --> 32:35.300]  Nice.
[32:36.440 --> 32:38.400]  Well, does that mean we get a four player minigame?
[32:39.060 --> 32:39.420]  Yeah.
[32:39.820 --> 32:40.360]  Four player minigame.
[32:40.840 --> 32:42.640]  Gavin, have you only landed on green still?
[32:43.180 --> 32:44.580]  No, I landed on one blue, I think.
[32:44.720 --> 32:45.440]  Oh, that's right.
[32:45.520 --> 32:46.720]  There was just green in it.
[32:46.880 --> 32:47.260]  That's right.
[32:49.160 --> 32:49.460]  Hey.
[32:50.000 --> 32:50.860]  Oh, give me, give me.
[32:51.700 --> 32:52.060]  Trampoline.
[32:53.920 --> 32:55.100]  Oh, what do we do here?
[32:55.440 --> 32:55.800]  Trample.
[32:58.940 --> 32:59.300]  Oh.
[32:59.380 --> 33:00.500]  I've never seen this one before.
[33:00.840 --> 33:01.500]  Oh, I see.
[33:01.880 --> 33:02.260]  Oh, I'm out.
[33:03.640 --> 33:04.180]  Got it.
[33:04.280 --> 33:04.580]  Got it.
[33:04.640 --> 33:04.860]  Okay.
[33:06.340 --> 33:06.700]  Easy.
[33:06.840 --> 33:07.120]  Let's do it.
[33:08.280 --> 33:09.000]  Oh, okay.
[33:10.280 --> 33:10.800]  Got it.
[33:11.260 --> 33:12.180]  You just go left to right.
[33:12.380 --> 33:13.520]  There's not a lot of variation.
[33:13.820 --> 33:14.760]  I see what I'm going to do here.
[33:14.780 --> 33:16.120]  There is, because I can also do this.
[33:16.220 --> 33:16.640]  Check this out.
[33:17.160 --> 33:17.520]  Okay.
[33:19.220 --> 33:19.580]  Yep.
[33:20.040 --> 33:20.360]  Yep.
[33:20.640 --> 33:21.000]  Yep.
[33:21.360 --> 33:21.620]  Yep.
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.040]  Yeah, now we're talking.
[33:24.020 --> 33:24.640]  Oh, now we're talking.
[33:24.640 --> 33:25.300]  Fuck you guys.
[33:25.680 --> 33:26.240]  All right, Gavin's out.
[33:26.240 --> 33:26.740]  Bitches.
[33:27.200 --> 33:28.320]  Trying to get me.
[33:29.720 --> 33:30.140]  Yeah.
[33:30.400 --> 33:31.240]  Eat shit, Nick.
[33:31.580 --> 33:33.280]  Trying to stomp on Dilkong.
[33:33.460 --> 33:34.860]  You can't stomp on Dilkong.
[33:35.860 --> 33:37.200]  Dilkong gets the points.
[33:37.640 --> 33:38.480]  Really bad.
[33:38.740 --> 33:39.580]  This is not good.
[33:40.300 --> 33:41.740]  Spinning out of control.
[33:41.920 --> 33:43.280]  Yeah, this is not good for you guys.
[33:43.960 --> 33:45.220]  I'm no longer happy for you.
[33:45.480 --> 33:46.680]  Like I was a little bit earlier.
[33:47.440 --> 33:48.720]  I wasn't, I was never happy.
[33:50.040 --> 33:51.220]  I couldn't be more happy.
[33:51.300 --> 33:53.840]  This is every day I wake up and it just, it gets better and better.
[33:55.140 --> 33:56.720]  Nick, am I close to her?
[33:57.520 --> 33:58.720]  All right, let's see.
[33:58.720 --> 34:00.640]  We're going to look at the board every time now.
[34:01.600 --> 34:03.740]  Oh, Nick is, and you guys can see in the video.
[34:03.780 --> 34:05.660]  Nick, explain what's on the board to us.
[34:06.280 --> 34:07.080]  Let's see.
[34:07.280 --> 34:10.000]  Coming up for Andrew.
[34:10.260 --> 34:13.760]  If he keeps moving in the right way here, he's going to get to Rosalina soon.
[34:13.800 --> 34:14.900]  He also has a Boo in his way.
[34:14.940 --> 34:16.700]  So we are in a bit of trouble.
[34:17.780 --> 34:19.260]  Geoff, right behind Andrew.
[34:19.340 --> 34:20.900]  So he also has the same path to follow.
[34:20.900 --> 34:27.360]  Gavin and I can rejoin on the main track and it's a race between us to the next star.
[34:27.680 --> 34:30.760]  Andrew, now that you're coming up on Boo, can I just say that I'm really happy for you this turn.
[34:31.420 --> 34:32.640]  Oh, thanks, man.
[34:32.720 --> 34:35.100]  Thanks for the, thanks for the balloon, Andrew.
[34:35.220 --> 34:35.760]  Oh, you're welcome.
[34:35.760 --> 34:37.980]  It was great to help celebrate your big day.
[34:38.300 --> 34:40.280]  Yeah, well, it was a great accomplishment by me.
[34:40.320 --> 34:41.420]  I'm going to have several more.
[34:41.800 --> 34:45.000]  I don't know if I'll give you guys gifts every time I do something great.
[34:45.440 --> 34:46.660]  They can get a little bit expensive.
[34:47.260 --> 34:48.720]  We've set a precedent here.
[34:48.720 --> 34:49.240]  Yeah.
[34:49.860 --> 34:51.920]  You know, well, listen, the first one's special.
[34:52.260 --> 34:54.020]  The seventh one I get is whatever.
[34:54.240 --> 34:55.760]  I'm just going to continue to win.
[34:56.120 --> 34:57.680]  Non-stop winning for the Dilkong.
[34:57.980 --> 34:59.460]  I'm getting Rosalina next episode.
[34:59.780 --> 35:00.140]  I'm excited.
[35:00.600 --> 35:01.720]  No, it's too far for that.
[35:01.920 --> 35:02.680]  Oh, fuck, really?
[35:02.860 --> 35:04.480]  Nick, you made it sound like it was so close.
[35:04.840 --> 35:06.380]  Does that mean you're going to send us a woman?
[35:07.740 --> 35:07.980]  What?
[35:08.160 --> 35:08.420]  What?
[35:08.540 --> 35:08.820]  What?
[35:09.500 --> 35:09.780]  What?
[35:10.180 --> 35:11.940]  He said it's a star before we got the stars.
[35:12.280 --> 35:13.440]  Well, we'll see you tomorrow.
[35:13.580 --> 35:15.900]  We'll end on that note and we'll see you tomorrow.
[35:16.660 --> 35:17.060]  Bye.
[35:17.060 --> 35:17.560]  Bye.
[35:18.200 --> 35:19.160]  Like a prostitute.
[35:20.680 --> 35:22.120]  That's worse than I imagined.
[35:23.720 --> 35:24.420]  Day six.
[35:25.220 --> 35:27.600]  Day six, shirts off, nipples out.
[35:27.700 --> 35:28.360]  Let's do it.
[35:28.980 --> 35:31.800]  I am going to get whatever...
[35:31.800 --> 35:33.320]  Rosalina, whatever her name is.
[35:33.660 --> 35:35.060]  You're not going to get Rosalina.
[35:35.120 --> 35:36.920]  It's going to be an exciting day.
[35:37.320 --> 35:37.480]  Yeah.
[35:37.840 --> 35:39.140]  Oh, if I hit...
[35:39.140 --> 35:41.120]  Okay, so if I hit the event space in front of me,
[35:41.180 --> 35:43.480]  I can actually get right to the star right now.
[35:43.820 --> 35:44.360]  Oh, that'd be cool.
[35:44.660 --> 35:44.980]  What?
[35:45.160 --> 35:46.740]  I can't wait to watch you not do that.
[35:46.740 --> 35:48.140]  Here we go.
[35:48.140 --> 35:48.520]  Really?
[35:48.760 --> 35:49.580]  I didn't do it.
[35:50.840 --> 35:52.720]  I just needed a two or a three.
[35:53.140 --> 35:55.100]  Oh, you're really setting up for next time.
[35:55.200 --> 35:56.600]  That's a fucking Geoff role right there.
[35:56.620 --> 35:57.560]  Can't wait for turn seven.
[35:57.920 --> 35:59.620]  All right, we got to start taking this.
[35:59.800 --> 36:01.300]  Smee, get off me. Get off me, son.
[36:01.340 --> 36:02.220]  Get him, get him, Smee.
[36:03.040 --> 36:04.940]  We got to start taking this seriously.
[36:05.120 --> 36:07.180]  Breathe into his mouth. Release the pea, Smee.
[36:07.820 --> 36:09.240]  All right, so I'm there.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.500]  I would like...
[36:11.500 --> 36:13.280]  What if Smee is just an agent of Andrew?
[36:14.260 --> 36:14.940]  Could be.
[36:15.640 --> 36:18.140]  I've been on a win for this moment for years.
[36:18.240 --> 36:19.120]  I've been slowly planning.
[36:20.280 --> 36:22.020]  All right, well, I needed some bunts.
[36:22.580 --> 36:25.020]  I'm doing some bunts dice.
[36:25.640 --> 36:26.820]  Oh, he's getting some money.
[36:27.860 --> 36:30.000]  What's the difference between the gold and the regular, Gavin?
[36:30.080 --> 36:30.720]  Yeah, what do these do?
[36:30.840 --> 36:33.860]  The gold gives me bunts, depending on how much I roll.
[36:34.120 --> 36:34.400]  Shit.
[36:35.300 --> 36:36.380]  What is bunts? Is it money?
[36:37.320 --> 36:39.440]  Bunts is, you know, bunts and burn a nice little earner.
[36:40.380 --> 36:42.300]  Oh, he's doing like cockney stuff.
[36:42.460 --> 36:43.020]  That's six, ten coins.
[36:43.020 --> 36:44.800]  It would be cool if it gave you 46 coins.
[36:45.520 --> 36:46.620]  Yeah, that would have been cool.
[36:46.740 --> 36:47.280]  That would have been great.
[36:48.280 --> 36:48.860]  Where am I going?
[36:51.580 --> 36:53.060]  Oh, here's the evil shop.
[36:53.140 --> 36:53.660]  What can you get?
[36:53.880 --> 36:54.700]  What's in here?
[36:54.900 --> 36:56.320]  Things that you can't find anywhere else.
[36:56.580 --> 36:58.720]  Did I get a treasure box?
[37:00.400 --> 37:01.820]  It's a dual glove.
[37:02.640 --> 37:03.080]  Wow.
[37:03.940 --> 37:05.040]  Move the star.
[37:06.420 --> 37:07.620]  Steal an item.
[37:08.440 --> 37:10.140]  I don't know if anyone's got good items.
[37:10.560 --> 37:11.600]  No, no one has anything.
[37:11.740 --> 37:12.500]  Not yet.
[37:13.100 --> 37:16.480]  I might pass on this turd store, to be honest.
[37:16.700 --> 37:16.880]  Crazy.
[37:17.680 --> 37:20.380]  But it's only going to last this turn, so...
[37:20.380 --> 37:21.080]  Think about it hard.
[37:21.900 --> 37:22.780]  Alright, I'll get hard.
[37:23.320 --> 37:24.280]  Oh, what?
[37:25.600 --> 37:26.560]  There you go.
[37:28.160 --> 37:29.220]  Like a rock.
[37:29.240 --> 37:29.940]  Move the star.
[37:31.320 --> 37:33.880]  You know, someone's getting a little bit cocky, like I'm going to get a star tomorrow.
[37:34.060 --> 37:35.840]  Maybe I'll get it on the move.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.620]  Oh, you can make your money back here, too.
[37:38.940 --> 37:39.640]  Hell yeah!
[37:40.020 --> 37:40.420]  Wow.
[37:41.300 --> 37:42.200]  It's coming up, Gavin.
[37:42.600 --> 37:44.480]  Pretty good turn.
[37:45.300 --> 37:46.280]  It's all coming up, Gavin.
[37:46.280 --> 37:51.660]  Okay, so I need a 12, and I believe that will get me both Rosalina and Boo.
[37:52.140 --> 37:54.500]  So let's go into these items.
[37:54.960 --> 37:56.760]  I need a little shroom on the go.
[37:57.340 --> 37:58.120]  Do a little shroom.
[37:58.640 --> 38:00.220]  So what do you need to make 12, Andrew?
[38:01.300 --> 38:01.900]  Let's see.
[38:02.460 --> 38:02.860]  Five.
[38:03.980 --> 38:05.560]  One, two, three, four...
[38:05.560 --> 38:07.360]  Seven. At least seven.
[38:08.360 --> 38:09.920]  That's quite a big ask.
[38:10.460 --> 38:11.620]  That's a big ask.
[38:12.300 --> 38:13.460]  Not for Dilkong!
[38:13.720 --> 38:14.800]  Not for Dillybaby!
[38:15.380 --> 38:15.760]  Fuck!
[38:17.860 --> 38:18.840]  There you go, you got seven.
[38:19.840 --> 38:21.520]  You didn't even get to Boo!
[38:21.700 --> 38:22.720]  You didn't get anything.
[38:23.780 --> 38:24.740]  This turn sucked.
[38:25.900 --> 38:26.940]  Alright, here we go.
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.720]  One, two, three, probably...
[38:30.720 --> 38:32.000]  Let's do...
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.440]  Double dice.
[38:33.440 --> 38:35.040]  I don't have any...
[38:35.600 --> 38:35.980]  Still seven.
[38:37.400 --> 38:39.460]  Can you imagine if we played the island level for this,
[38:39.540 --> 38:42.000]  and we got stuck on one of the islands during high tide?
[38:42.700 --> 38:44.220]  We stuck there for three days.
[38:44.920 --> 38:45.720]  Oh no!
[38:45.940 --> 38:46.960]  That might be Rosalina!
[38:47.420 --> 38:48.220]  That's incredible.
[38:48.580 --> 38:52.320]  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[38:52.580 --> 38:52.700]  Wait!
[38:53.260 --> 38:53.640]  Oh no!
[38:55.500 --> 38:56.400]  Steal them from Andrew.
[38:58.740 --> 39:00.220]  I can't take a star!
[39:00.220 --> 39:01.100]  You're not going to get many from me,
[39:01.100 --> 39:03.040]  you're going to get way more from Nick if you go after Nick,
[39:03.160 --> 39:03.840]  because he's got 45.
[39:06.160 --> 39:07.720]  Tactically, you've got to cripple Andrew
[39:07.720 --> 39:09.080]  while he's in the lead.
[39:09.180 --> 39:10.220]  I think you should just take it from Gavin.
[39:10.840 --> 39:13.280]  I think that Geoff's an adult and can make his own decisions.
[39:13.500 --> 39:14.500]  You do whatever you want, Geoff.
[39:15.600 --> 39:17.600]  Yeah, just think about the ice cream bar
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.800]  and the stupid star that's up there.
[39:18.940 --> 39:20.180]  Oh my god, he's picked Mario.
[39:21.400 --> 39:22.260]  You better start hitting the button.
[39:22.800 --> 39:24.720]  Listen, that's a pragmatic decision.
[39:25.140 --> 39:27.860]  It had nothing to do with my personal feelings towards either of you.
[39:28.220 --> 39:29.400]  If it did, Andrew would have been boned.
[39:32.480 --> 39:33.440]  See, but...
[39:33.440 --> 39:35.600]  Nick is by far my favorite in the company.
[39:35.680 --> 39:36.200]  Oh, you know what?
[39:37.000 --> 39:37.740]  It shows.
[39:39.440 --> 39:40.160]  Oh wow.
[39:40.640 --> 39:41.660]  Oh, you're off.
[39:42.080 --> 39:43.420]  Oh no, you're going to miss Rosalina!
[39:43.860 --> 39:44.780]  Yeah, you are.
[39:45.880 --> 39:47.560]  Securing Rosalina for me!
[39:48.120 --> 39:49.000]  Where's it send you?
[39:49.160 --> 39:49.980]  Oh, no he's not!
[39:49.980 --> 39:50.520]  He's going back!
[39:50.960 --> 39:54.480]  He can get Boo again!
[39:55.160 --> 39:56.880]  If Geoff gets a good amount of coins,
[39:56.880 --> 39:58.360]  Geoff might have enough to steal a star.
[39:58.620 --> 40:00.140]  Oh no!
[40:00.660 --> 40:01.880]  He'll just use 20 more coins.
[40:02.200 --> 40:03.720]  Geoff can't win this real fast.
[40:05.060 --> 40:05.480]  Domination!
[40:06.340 --> 40:07.580]  Isn't this a Call of Duty thing?
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.000]  I play Domination every day!
[40:10.560 --> 40:12.020]  Alright, what are we doing here?
[40:13.200 --> 40:14.280]  Oh god, okay.
[40:15.180 --> 40:16.160]  Mash the button, baby!
[40:16.820 --> 40:17.880]  Do I need to stand up for this?
[40:19.200 --> 40:21.500]  There's no way I'm going to get this today.
[40:21.920 --> 40:22.680]  I don't have it in me.
[40:23.240 --> 40:25.020]  It is early to do this!
[40:25.020 --> 40:26.780]  I've always hated button mashing.
[40:27.920 --> 40:28.440]  Come on, Wario.
[40:28.840 --> 40:29.960]  I need a sip of coffee, hold on.
[40:29.980 --> 40:31.300]  I'm just testing my location.
[40:35.700 --> 40:37.680]  Okay, I've tested my location as well.
[40:38.200 --> 40:39.600]  Yeah, you're already readied up though.
[40:40.400 --> 40:41.480]  Yeah, I'm saving energy.
[40:41.640 --> 40:42.840]  I'm going to have to stand in the other room.
[40:43.600 --> 40:44.540]  Dilkong needs to conserve.
[40:46.400 --> 40:47.640]  Alright, I'll let you know when to go.
[40:48.700 --> 40:49.720]  Are you going to the other room?
[40:51.880 --> 40:52.960]  Alright Gavin, get ready.
[40:52.960 --> 40:53.680]  Go!
[41:00.060 --> 41:00.420]  Dilkong!
[41:01.280 --> 41:01.640]  Dilkong!
[41:02.920 --> 41:04.400]  Geoff, I don't think you're winning this one.
[41:04.400 --> 41:05.180]  I don't think I got it.
[41:06.120 --> 41:07.020]  I think I stumbled.
[41:10.360 --> 41:11.340]  Come on, Dil!
[41:12.100 --> 41:13.660]  Dil is just unbeatable.
[41:13.760 --> 41:15.520]  I could tell by his screaming that he was doing it.
[41:16.320 --> 41:16.680]  Yes!
[41:17.360 --> 41:18.040]  I won!
[41:18.040 --> 41:19.860]  At least I beat one.
[41:20.220 --> 41:22.310]  I almost shit my pants to come second.
[41:23.400 --> 41:25.220]  You almost shit your pants to come?
[41:26.020 --> 41:26.300]  What?
[41:29.300 --> 41:31.340]  His prostate is messed up.
[41:32.560 --> 41:33.640]  That won?
[41:33.740 --> 41:34.360]  What a turn.
[41:34.660 --> 41:37.260]  One turn, one press.
[41:37.540 --> 41:39.320]  I need to get 18 coins stacked.
[41:39.900 --> 41:40.900]  It's a close game.
[41:41.340 --> 41:42.500]  I know where you can steal them.
[41:42.980 --> 41:44.700]  Rosalina's got one turn before she leaves.
[41:44.700 --> 41:45.920]  Uh oh.
[41:46.060 --> 41:47.880]  We have a limited time.
[41:47.980 --> 41:49.020]  I'll see you soon, Rosalina.
[41:49.200 --> 41:50.860]  The track's returning to once it came.
[41:51.540 --> 41:52.660]  It's flipping back.
[41:53.120 --> 41:54.640]  We're going to have to rewatch this part.
[41:57.300 --> 41:58.700]  That's a good view of the board.
[41:59.520 --> 42:00.400]  It is a good view.
[42:01.620 --> 42:02.340]  Speaking of which,
[42:02.560 --> 42:05.240]  let's take a look at the board for next time.
[42:05.540 --> 42:06.620]  Another turn in the bag.
[42:06.900 --> 42:08.180]  How far away am I from Rosalina?
[42:08.260 --> 42:10.340]  So, DK is now
[42:10.340 --> 42:13.040]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces away from Rosalina
[42:13.040 --> 42:14.320]  while Geoff is
[42:14.320 --> 42:16.480]  6, 7, 8 spaces away.
[42:16.600 --> 42:19.520]  Very close. Gavin is in striking distance of the star.
[42:19.760 --> 42:20.800]  If he uses his double blocks,
[42:20.900 --> 42:21.560]  he could get there.
[42:23.400 --> 42:24.500]  It's definitely over 10.
[42:25.240 --> 42:26.620]  And I'm... I'm fucked.
[42:30.240 --> 42:30.720]  Um...
[42:30.720 --> 42:31.960]  Well, there you have it.
[42:32.480 --> 42:34.000]  Mario Party, another one in the books.
[42:34.940 --> 42:36.880]  We'll see you tomorrow for another day.
[42:37.320 --> 42:37.700]  Bye!
[42:38.540 --> 42:39.500]  Andrew's unstoppable.
[42:40.200 --> 42:41.120]  Yeah, no kidding.
[42:41.580 --> 42:42.540]  Till Geoff gets him.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.200]  Fuck him up, Geoff!
[42:45.660 --> 42:47.360]  I'll be fucking myself up.
[42:47.540 --> 42:48.440]  Thank you very much.
[42:50.160 --> 42:51.100]  Gavin's still hard.
[42:53.840 --> 42:55.340]  Holy shit, come. Okay, bye.
[42:56.120 --> 42:56.980]  What the fuck?
[42:58.520 --> 42:58.960]  Woohoo!
[43:03.560 --> 43:05.440]  This'll be it. Week 1 in the books.
[43:05.560 --> 43:06.460]  After this one, boys.
[43:06.460 --> 43:09.560]  This is day 7 of Mario Party March.
[43:09.680 --> 43:10.660]  Thank you for joining us.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.500]  The whole board is shifting.
[43:12.620 --> 43:13.600]  Everything's changing.
[43:14.080 --> 43:16.800]  The power balance could be upside down
[43:16.800 --> 43:18.100]  at the end of this episode.
[43:19.240 --> 43:19.780]  No, it's gone.
[43:20.280 --> 43:21.400]  I blew it.
[43:22.080 --> 43:23.900]  Oh, this is a good start.
[43:24.180 --> 43:25.120]  That was last time.
[43:25.440 --> 43:26.760]  Oh, hell yeah.
[43:27.320 --> 43:30.180]  So we're like a quarter of the way through, then.
[43:30.840 --> 43:31.920]  I can't believe it.
[43:32.200 --> 43:32.840]  Something like that.
[43:32.840 --> 43:34.300]  Oh, it's a big number.
[43:35.440 --> 43:36.940]  I love when you get two dice
[43:36.940 --> 43:38.360]  blocked to make one.
[43:39.380 --> 43:40.780]  Hey, get money and some coins.
[43:41.020 --> 43:41.800]  Hey, good job.
[43:42.520 --> 43:43.280]  Those'll be going to Andrew.
[43:43.600 --> 43:46.580]  I'm gonna put boo on your ass and get my coins back.
[43:47.440 --> 43:49.020]  Oh, what a day it's gonna be.
[43:49.240 --> 43:49.700]  Hey, look!
[43:50.640 --> 43:52.020]  Getting a little launch here.
[43:53.500 --> 43:54.100]  Is that good?
[43:54.280 --> 43:55.720]  Are you good with that, or no?
[43:56.660 --> 43:58.860]  I get a little bit of a boost, and then it gets me
[43:58.860 --> 44:00.000]  four spaces forward, I think.
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.720]  Look at the speed on that race car.
[44:01.880 --> 44:03.520]  Mario Verstappen, right?
[44:04.340 --> 44:05.040]  That's insane.
[44:06.020 --> 44:07.640]  That was nice.
[44:08.180 --> 44:08.680]  Thank you, thank you.
[44:08.900 --> 44:10.560]  So, hmm.
[44:11.680 --> 44:13.500]  Wario Verstappen, am I right?
[44:13.860 --> 44:15.540]  You know one guy.
[44:15.780 --> 44:16.480]  That's comedy.
[44:17.060 --> 44:20.080]  Lewis Hamilton Wario.
[44:20.400 --> 44:21.480]  Lewis Hamilton Wario.
[44:22.740 --> 44:24.020]  Signs Wario.
[44:24.320 --> 44:25.300]  Wario Johnson.
[44:27.420 --> 44:29.260]  So if you go through the pits, you get items.
[44:29.380 --> 44:30.960]  And if you go through the normal, you get the money.
[44:31.480 --> 44:32.260]  Apparently, yeah.
[44:32.580 --> 44:34.540]  And the money goes up each time you go through.
[44:34.800 --> 44:35.440]  Good to know.
[44:35.580 --> 44:39.460]  I mean, I heard that on the intro to the game.
[44:39.820 --> 44:41.060]  Somebody's been paying attention.
[44:41.400 --> 44:42.380]  It's a fucking dice!
[44:42.580 --> 44:43.080]  It was a week ago.
[44:44.420 --> 44:45.540]  I remember things.
[44:46.040 --> 44:46.420]  Oh, no!
[44:47.520 --> 44:48.860]  Two, two, two, one.
[44:49.180 --> 44:50.320]  One, two, one.
[44:51.200 --> 44:52.000]  Oh, wow!
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.580]  Oh, wow!
[44:53.740 --> 44:54.800]  And you got ten coins for that.
[44:56.340 --> 44:58.360]  Three times. Two more times, you go to jail.
[44:59.040 --> 44:59.760]  That was true.
[45:00.560 --> 45:01.760]  Send Wario to jail.
[45:02.340 --> 45:04.240]  Go long way, go long way, go long way.
[45:04.420 --> 45:05.760]  Let's see what happens long way.
[45:06.420 --> 45:07.180]  Easy mode.
[45:08.080 --> 45:09.560]  Go left. Go left. Damn.
[45:11.520 --> 45:12.140]  Oh, wow.
[45:12.640 --> 45:12.960]  Oh!
[45:13.960 --> 45:16.060]  Gavin getting his first star.
[45:16.480 --> 45:17.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's it.
[45:17.700 --> 45:18.820]  This is what we're talking about.
[45:18.820 --> 45:21.040]  The power dynamic is shifting.
[45:21.260 --> 45:23.240]  Yeah, but I'm still not in the lead.
[45:23.360 --> 45:23.760]  So let's...
[45:24.580 --> 45:25.600]  Let's look at Andrew.
[45:26.780 --> 45:28.360]  Let's look at Andrew.
[45:28.640 --> 45:29.980]  You're both in the crosshairs.
[45:30.740 --> 45:31.180]  Dang.
[45:32.500 --> 45:33.800]  Geoff, how you feeling? No star.
[45:34.800 --> 45:36.400]  That seems about appropriate for me.
[45:37.120 --> 45:38.260]  I'm feeling about right.
[45:38.840 --> 45:40.340]  Oh, the next one's at the top.
[45:40.800 --> 45:42.140]  I come on strong at the end.
[45:42.220 --> 45:44.540]  That was a close second last time we played Mario Party.
[45:44.820 --> 45:45.960]  Nick, you're primed for that.
[45:46.540 --> 45:46.940]  Yeah.
[45:47.760 --> 45:49.000]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[45:50.860 --> 45:52.680]  Feeling pretty okay at the moment.
[45:53.620 --> 45:53.840]  Alright.
[45:54.320 --> 45:56.600]  So moving the star, just moving it back to where I just got it from.
[45:56.600 --> 45:58.040]  What a roll. Yeah, pretty much.
[45:58.440 --> 45:59.020]  Alright, let's see.
[45:59.700 --> 46:02.140]  Yeah, I think it switches between those two spots.
[46:03.500 --> 46:04.660]  You are in first.
[46:05.160 --> 46:06.980]  Hey, remember what you said about me being in first?
[46:07.200 --> 46:08.480]  You are in first, Gavin.
[46:08.680 --> 46:09.400]  Uh-oh.
[46:10.380 --> 46:12.880]  Hey, I think you might need to steal some other money here, Andrew.
[46:13.180 --> 46:13.820]  Uh, yeah.
[46:13.820 --> 46:16.440]  I'm gonna go through Boo and then Rosalina?
[46:16.660 --> 46:17.140]  What's her name?
[46:18.040 --> 46:19.660]  It's gonna be a long turn today.
[46:19.660 --> 46:20.400]  Here we go.
[46:21.900 --> 46:23.100]  Charge the dice!
[46:24.100 --> 46:24.260]  Yes!
[46:25.500 --> 46:26.260]  Oh, I needed that.
[46:27.620 --> 46:28.860]  Why does he live in a tree?
[46:29.160 --> 46:31.120]  I don't know! That's what I was saying.
[46:32.980 --> 46:33.420]  Now...
[46:33.420 --> 46:35.060]  You need those coins back, Nick.
[46:35.280 --> 46:36.860]  You're legitimately...
[46:36.860 --> 46:37.400]  Time to fight, Nick.
[46:37.820 --> 46:39.580]  You put Boo on me first.
[46:39.580 --> 46:40.680]  Nick, fight.
[46:41.040 --> 46:43.400]  Yeah, that's retaliation and you have the most coins.
[46:43.800 --> 46:44.240]  Yeah.
[46:44.480 --> 46:48.200]  I don't have a star, so I'm not a threat at the moment!
[46:48.700 --> 46:49.760]  Yeah, but now you...
[46:49.760 --> 46:52.020]  But now you don't have enough money to buy a star.
[46:52.320 --> 46:53.740]  That's kinda...
[46:54.320 --> 46:54.760]  Yeah!
[46:55.360 --> 46:57.120]  36 coins. Oh, here we go.
[46:57.520 --> 46:57.920]  What?
[46:58.560 --> 47:00.460]  Except 5 coins for getting here.
[47:00.860 --> 47:02.780]  Now I have to play the game.
[47:02.960 --> 47:04.820]  Oh, shit, it's a showdown minigame!
[47:05.200 --> 47:07.040]  Yeah, so Andrew has the advantage.
[47:07.040 --> 47:08.660]  But anyone can win this.
[47:10.660 --> 47:11.320]  Well, let's race.
[47:11.640 --> 47:13.000]  Let's do this.
[47:14.160 --> 47:15.500]  Oh, what are we gonna do?
[47:15.700 --> 47:16.880]  One sheep at random.
[47:18.500 --> 47:19.260]  Bog and bin.
[47:20.520 --> 47:20.720]  Oh.
[47:22.720 --> 47:23.940]  Okay, here we go, boys.
[47:26.720 --> 47:29.000]  Rosalina has a gift card for 5 below.
[47:29.400 --> 47:30.280]  Oh, shit.
[47:30.660 --> 47:32.040]  I'm gonna put it on my strap.
[47:32.900 --> 47:33.500]  Oh, it's this!
[47:33.500 --> 47:34.080]  What are we doing?
[47:34.920 --> 47:36.300]  It's Rosalina's Radical Race.
[47:37.740 --> 47:39.700]  Oh, it's cool borders.
[47:41.200 --> 47:42.020]  Alright, Gavin.
[47:42.480 --> 47:43.540]  How you feeling about
[47:44.560 --> 47:45.200]  doing
[47:45.200 --> 47:46.740]  snowboard stuff?
[47:47.800 --> 47:48.880]  You feel good, Gavin?
[47:48.980 --> 47:50.280]  Seems nice and responsive.
[47:50.840 --> 47:52.800]  Not feeling good.
[47:53.280 --> 47:53.740]  Lock in.
[47:55.920 --> 47:57.920]  So, Andrew has a boost item
[47:57.920 --> 47:58.940]  right when he starts.
[47:59.140 --> 47:59.480]  Yeah!
[48:00.340 --> 48:01.940]  How do you use the boost item?
[48:03.200 --> 48:04.200]  How do you use the boost item?
[48:04.360 --> 48:04.860]  Like that.
[48:05.060 --> 48:06.740]  You gotta hit Y.
[48:07.200 --> 48:07.640]  Hold Y.
[48:09.880 --> 48:10.360]  Alright.
[48:11.480 --> 48:11.960]  Okay.
[48:13.020 --> 48:14.840]  Does leaning forward do anything?
[48:15.500 --> 48:17.520]  Yeah, but you have to physically
[48:17.520 --> 48:18.500]  lean your body forward.
[48:19.040 --> 48:20.100]  I'm doing that.
[48:21.120 --> 48:22.920]  There's no way he screws this up.
[48:23.540 --> 48:24.420]  I'm locked in.
[48:25.100 --> 48:26.920]  I'm getting you, Rosalina. Don't you worry.
[48:27.580 --> 48:28.680]  Alright, everyone better...
[48:28.680 --> 48:31.100]  Okay, there goes Wario. Alright, here we go.
[48:31.460 --> 48:32.980]  We're locking in. We're getting close.
[48:33.060 --> 48:34.120]  Andrew, they're on your tail.
[48:34.160 --> 48:37.360]  Yeah, I'm aware. I feel like Nick's trying to play my games, but you can't mess with the Dilkong.
[48:37.420 --> 48:38.000]  No, Geoff!
[48:38.560 --> 48:39.920]  Dilkong's all about this life.
[48:40.720 --> 48:41.480]  Geoff, please!
[48:42.260 --> 48:44.660]  Andrew hits the first boost, misses the second.
[48:45.460 --> 48:46.840]  Hits the third boost,
[48:46.980 --> 48:47.780]  misses the fourth.
[48:48.780 --> 48:50.240]  Hits the fifth boost.
[48:50.680 --> 48:52.520]  Oh, and here comes Wario
[48:52.520 --> 48:54.140]  on the tail of Dilkong.
[48:54.140 --> 48:56.060]  Oh my god.
[48:56.260 --> 48:57.560]  Oh my god.
[48:57.800 --> 48:59.540]  Why are we cheering for Gavin? He's in first!
[49:01.460 --> 49:02.120]  Oh wait, yeah, fuck!
[49:02.300 --> 49:03.000]  Alright, be careful.
[49:03.360 --> 49:05.060]  Here he comes.
[49:05.220 --> 49:07.660]  Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[49:07.860 --> 49:08.720]  Make him laugh.
[49:09.740 --> 49:10.880]  How are you ahead of me?
[49:11.840 --> 49:13.080]  What the fuck?
[49:13.460 --> 49:16.380]  The tricks have paid off, and Wario is unbeatable.
[49:16.660 --> 49:17.440]  Is he in the position?
[49:17.460 --> 49:19.480]  What is he doing? He's played this game before!
[49:19.820 --> 49:22.200]  The advantage is all Dilkong.
[49:22.200 --> 49:23.300]  We all did it before.
[49:24.300 --> 49:25.760]  You won it the last time!
[49:26.800 --> 49:28.220]  You gotta do the tricks, you gotta do the tricks.
[49:28.500 --> 49:29.400]  Do the tricks!
[49:30.540 --> 49:31.580]  How do I do the tricks?
[49:32.500 --> 49:33.820]  Dilkong and Wario, he missed the boost.
[49:35.520 --> 49:36.540]  How do you do the tricks?
[49:36.980 --> 49:37.900]  Wario hits the second boost.
[49:38.360 --> 49:39.400]  Wario on the third boost.
[49:39.960 --> 49:40.920]  Yeah, on the jumps.
[49:42.980 --> 49:44.580]  This is anyone's game,
[49:44.620 --> 49:45.480]  he hits the next boost.
[49:45.720 --> 49:47.460]  Coming up to the end.
[49:48.060 --> 49:49.880]  Why didn't you say anything about this?
[49:49.880 --> 49:51.140]  Here comes Dilkong.
[49:53.340 --> 49:54.400]  Wario into the wall.
[49:54.500 --> 49:55.440]  Shit, I missed it!
[49:55.900 --> 49:56.920]  Dilkong into the wall.
[49:57.180 --> 49:58.740]  Neck and neck.
[50:00.140 --> 50:02.020]  My controller's like desyncing!
[50:03.100 --> 50:04.560]  Dilkong is falling hard.
[50:04.560 --> 50:05.280]  It's desyncing!
[50:06.040 --> 50:08.400]  Here comes Wario. Wario in the front.
[50:08.640 --> 50:09.580]  Could he do it?
[50:10.500 --> 50:11.480]  Huge trick.
[50:12.600 --> 50:13.580]  Misses the boost.
[50:14.280 --> 50:15.140]  I hit the damn wall again.
[50:15.900 --> 50:17.240]  Oh my god, Wario.
[50:17.240 --> 50:17.740]  Oh!
[50:19.660 --> 50:20.700]  Do you
[50:21.700 --> 50:23.520]  believe in miracles?
[50:23.700 --> 50:25.680]  I was so clenched that whole game.
[50:26.200 --> 50:27.300]  Congratulations, Wario.
[50:28.180 --> 50:28.840]  Everything hurts.
[50:29.100 --> 50:31.140]  I looked, I didn't know. I should've tabbed
[50:31.140 --> 50:32.440]  to the other screens, I guess.
[50:32.940 --> 50:35.040]  All the instructions are typically right at the beginning.
[50:35.760 --> 50:36.380]  There they were though.
[50:36.860 --> 50:38.740]  It says shake on the jumps.
[50:39.480 --> 50:39.860]  Gavin,
[50:40.840 --> 50:43.000]  you now have Rosalina
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.840]  as an ally. I don't know what she does.
[50:45.840 --> 50:48.120]  She can double whatever you buy.
[50:49.100 --> 50:50.680]  And she'll also give you items, I think.
[50:50.860 --> 50:52.100]  But you can just drive past me
[50:52.100 --> 50:52.760]  and take her if you want.
[50:53.280 --> 50:54.560]  And I sure will!
[50:55.420 --> 50:57.220]  You're gonna void the star?
[50:57.680 --> 50:59.020]  No! Come on!
[50:59.060 --> 51:00.380]  It's all going down, Dil!
[51:00.840 --> 51:02.420]  Oh my god.
[51:02.860 --> 51:06.000]  Oh, it's looking so good
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.560]  for the Dil on day six!
[51:08.880 --> 51:10.180]  Dil's been absolutely
[51:10.180 --> 51:11.320]  dilled this turn.
[51:13.720 --> 51:14.520]  Fuck it.
[51:14.520 --> 51:15.760]  Just do something.
[51:17.420 --> 51:18.560]  That's more coins
[51:18.560 --> 51:20.180]  than I got from Nick!
[51:20.620 --> 51:21.200]  It's my money!
[51:21.820 --> 51:23.560]  It was mine to begin with!
[51:24.100 --> 51:24.340]  No!
[51:26.560 --> 51:28.180]  Geoff hasn't even gone yet.
[51:28.360 --> 51:29.160]  God damn it.
[51:31.960 --> 51:33.700]  Geoff hasn't done shit.
[51:34.020 --> 51:35.360]  It's been a long one.
[51:37.420 --> 51:38.020]  Alright, here we go!
[51:38.320 --> 51:38.820]  My turn!
[51:40.540 --> 51:41.500]  Oh, roll a three.
[51:42.400 --> 51:44.000]  This will be fun.
[51:46.400 --> 51:47.520]  People will look at the
[51:47.520 --> 51:49.040]  time of this video and be like,
[51:49.120 --> 51:50.080]  oh, they must have hit Rosalina.
[51:51.180 --> 51:51.580]  Yeah.
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.540]  They'll know, who are you gonna do it?
[51:55.740 --> 51:56.640]  Oh my god.
[51:56.640 --> 51:58.540]  He got dilled on this turn.
[51:58.820 --> 52:01.140]  You got so dilled, dude.
[52:01.260 --> 52:03.900]  I didn't get a star, I didn't get a dilly bar.
[52:04.120 --> 52:05.620]  All those gifts ran out.
[52:06.360 --> 52:07.360]  He tried, but
[52:07.360 --> 52:09.380]  you got both of those, what are you talking about?
[52:10.800 --> 52:11.740]  Oh no, Geoff!
[52:11.740 --> 52:12.600]  What have you done for me lately?
[52:13.460 --> 52:15.040]  I think that was for this, though.
[52:15.200 --> 52:16.880]  More so than Nick or Gavin.
[52:18.100 --> 52:19.660]  But, that's what happens when you set an
[52:19.660 --> 52:20.660]  expectation of death.
[52:21.060 --> 52:21.560]  It's true.
[52:22.380 --> 52:25.520]  It's like you train your dog to get a treat every time you leave the house.
[52:25.640 --> 52:25.940]  You know what I mean?
[52:26.280 --> 52:27.800]  Oh my god.
[52:28.980 --> 52:31.400]  Don't worry, Andrew's on a tear of winning minigames.
[52:32.080 --> 52:33.400]  I just lost one.
[52:34.220 --> 52:35.200]  That was a
[52:35.200 --> 52:36.440]  woman game, wasn't it?
[52:37.120 --> 52:37.520]  What?
[52:38.120 --> 52:39.660]  It wasn't for coins.
[52:40.200 --> 52:42.300]  Dude, what are you saying?
[52:42.780 --> 52:44.460]  It was for Rosalina, it wasn't for coins.
[52:46.340 --> 52:48.740]  Okay, so you want to move your thing back and forth.
[52:49.280 --> 52:50.780]  Yeah, but you have to be careful of each other.
[52:53.100 --> 52:53.500]  Okay.
[52:55.000 --> 52:55.880]  Ready up, boys.
[52:56.400 --> 52:58.020]  No, we don't. We don't want him to hit.
[52:58.620 --> 52:59.920]  We're making him dodge.
[53:00.140 --> 53:01.720]  Why would you want him to hit?
[53:01.720 --> 53:03.880]  Okie dokie.
[53:08.060 --> 53:09.220]  Sorry, I thought I hit it.
[53:09.320 --> 53:16.240]  I don't like that there isn't a pump fake or anything.
[53:16.920 --> 53:17.180]  Yeah.
[53:18.460 --> 53:21.180]  Oh, I thought he was going to land into it.
[53:21.920 --> 53:23.120]  Nick, what are you doing?
[53:23.300 --> 53:24.520]  What the fuck?
[53:25.380 --> 53:26.160]  Oh no, weak link!
[53:27.740 --> 53:28.800]  I got it now.
[53:28.800 --> 53:31.720]  Well, this feels so fucked.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.180]  I am so slow.
[53:33.760 --> 53:35.440]  Why just keep shooting it, Nick?
[53:35.500 --> 53:36.960]  You're fine.
[53:37.740 --> 53:38.740]  Oh, finally.
[53:40.260 --> 53:41.280]  He only needs 30.
[53:42.160 --> 53:42.700]  30 more.
[53:43.420 --> 53:44.840]  That was a little bit of a...
[53:44.840 --> 53:47.020]  I ribbed it, I ribbed it.
[53:47.700 --> 53:48.060]  Yeah!
[53:49.340 --> 53:49.920]  Yeah!
[53:50.560 --> 53:52.080]  One second left.
[53:52.680 --> 53:54.700]  Oh, the nail comes off me!
[53:55.480 --> 53:56.760]  The fate has changed.
[53:56.760 --> 53:57.560]  You suck.
[53:58.940 --> 53:59.900]  Oh, Kevin!
[54:01.560 --> 54:02.820]  What did you do?
[54:02.820 --> 54:04.200]  You gave him a bullseye!
[54:04.320 --> 54:05.740]  He needed a bullseye!
[54:06.180 --> 54:09.440]  I started putting my controller down because it was going to be over.
[54:10.520 --> 54:12.200]  Why would you put your controller down?
[54:12.200 --> 54:13.220]  Another upset!
[54:13.640 --> 54:15.260]  I didn't put it down, I just lowered it.
[54:15.320 --> 54:17.680]  And it was just on my leg and it must have boinked over.
[54:17.960 --> 54:18.980]  What a maroon.
[54:19.480 --> 54:22.260]  What an end to the first week
[54:22.920 --> 54:24.500]  of Mario Party March.
[54:24.500 --> 54:25.700]  Nick, show them the board.
[54:28.120 --> 54:30.360]  Well, next time, Andrew has his pick
[54:30.360 --> 54:32.460]  of going to the pits or cross and go.
[54:32.580 --> 54:34.700]  Maybe, except he has to roll a one to three.
[54:35.160 --> 54:36.480]  I might have a shot at a star.
[54:36.820 --> 54:38.040]  Probably takes two turns.
[54:38.560 --> 54:40.320]  Gavin, well, he's
[54:40.320 --> 54:42.640]  coming up behind Geoff, and Geoff, well, he's
[54:42.640 --> 54:43.280]  next to Boo.
[54:43.540 --> 54:47.080]  Is anyone within snatching distance of Rosalina?
[54:48.040 --> 54:48.800]  I'm the closest,
[54:49.100 --> 54:49.520]  and no.
[54:52.300 --> 54:53.220]  There you go.
[54:53.420 --> 54:53.940]  Alright.
[54:54.780 --> 54:55.760]  I love this game.
[54:56.600 --> 54:57.120]  I can't wait.
[54:57.580 --> 55:00.020]  A bullseye!
[55:00.180 --> 55:01.120]  You put it down!
[55:01.240 --> 55:03.620]  Okay, we'll see you next time. Bye!
[55:03.980 --> 55:04.140]  Bye!
[55:05.460 --> 55:07.200]  Welcome to Turn 8.
[55:07.460 --> 55:09.820]  Don't worry about anything we were talking about right before this
[55:09.820 --> 55:11.220]  because it's Mario's turn
[55:11.220 --> 55:13.220]  to stick it to everybody.
[55:13.500 --> 55:15.860]  He's 13 away from the star.
[55:16.220 --> 55:17.340]  Stick it to me, Mario.
[55:17.340 --> 55:19.900]  Put it right in me. Stick it right in me.
[55:20.020 --> 55:21.180]  Crumbs and crust me, Mario.
[55:21.380 --> 55:22.420]  Crumbs and crust me.
[55:23.980 --> 55:25.240]  Crumbs, man. Come on.
[55:25.820 --> 55:27.500]  Gavin, yell crust or crumbs, and that's
[55:27.500 --> 55:29.340]  what he'll roll. No, what are you talking about?
[55:29.440 --> 55:30.220]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[55:31.320 --> 55:33.480]  I think that was definitely, that was crumbs.
[55:33.820 --> 55:34.440]  He threw crumbs.
[55:35.240 --> 55:36.700]  That's a definite crumb.
[55:37.560 --> 55:39.120]  That was a bit of a crummy turn, Nick.
[55:39.220 --> 55:40.600]  Oh, who's on my ass? Oh, it's Rosalina.
[55:40.680 --> 55:42.320]  I forgot to give Rosalina.
[55:43.500 --> 55:45.180]  Oh yeah, she gonna give me some stuff or something?
[55:45.180 --> 55:46.540]  Yeah, she gonna give you something.
[55:46.560 --> 55:47.940]  The cheap grab bag?
[55:49.140 --> 55:49.500]  Thanks.
[55:50.740 --> 55:52.480]  I got an achievement for that.
[55:53.980 --> 55:55.420]  So that'll take you to a
[55:55.420 --> 55:57.140]  random person.
[55:57.500 --> 55:59.420]  Not even a player space. Just a random
[55:59.420 --> 56:01.200]  space. You might want to just chance it
[56:01.200 --> 56:03.320]  because I don't know that you can get much further
[56:03.320 --> 56:05.480]  from, oh, you could use the whistle to move
[56:05.480 --> 56:06.000]  the star.
[56:07.220 --> 56:09.140]  Because the star's like up above you, isn't it?
[56:09.400 --> 56:11.720]  Yeah, but it's behind him no matter what though.
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.300]  I mean, if I warped
[56:13.300 --> 56:14.560]  and somehow made it to Nick,
[56:14.920 --> 56:16.820]  that would be pretty cool.
[56:16.920 --> 56:19.180]  But I would not want to warp to Andrew.
[56:19.640 --> 56:19.880]  Yeah.
[56:20.880 --> 56:22.640]  Oh, because they take Rosalina.
[56:23.280 --> 56:24.500]  Oh, that's true.
[56:24.820 --> 56:27.240]  Well, the defensive move would be to play the
[56:27.240 --> 56:28.220]  whistle, I think.
[56:28.400 --> 56:31.660]  I think so too, but I don't know how Gavin's brain works.
[56:31.860 --> 56:32.760]  I think you should use the pipe.
[56:33.040 --> 56:33.860]  Here's what I'm gonna use.
[56:34.380 --> 56:35.580]  You're gonna use a double dice?
[56:35.980 --> 56:39.080]  That was probably the least interesting choice.
[56:39.240 --> 56:41.080]  I mean, it absolutely makes no sense to do this.
[56:41.080 --> 56:43.180]  You're going to catch Andrew or Geoff now.
[56:43.920 --> 56:44.000]  No.
[56:44.380 --> 56:47.680]  You think this is the least interesting move?
[56:48.020 --> 56:48.640]  No, no.
[56:48.820 --> 56:51.420]  The one that makes the least sense. I didn't say anything about interesting.
[56:51.640 --> 56:52.540]  I said least interesting.
[56:52.980 --> 56:55.520]  I would actually argue it was the least interesting as well.
[56:55.740 --> 56:57.460]  I think it's definitely the least interesting.
[56:57.700 --> 56:59.200]  Let's see how interesting this is.
[57:01.060 --> 57:01.500]  Well...
[57:02.580 --> 57:03.020]  You...
[57:03.700 --> 57:05.400]  Okay, you can steal coins.
[57:05.960 --> 57:07.440]  Cool. I know who to steal them from.
[57:07.700 --> 57:08.920]  Is that interesting, Geoff?
[57:08.920 --> 57:10.520]  Pretty interesting.
[57:10.700 --> 57:11.900]  I'm fascinated.
[57:12.060 --> 57:12.560]  What?
[57:14.980 --> 57:17.360]  I'm a little interested all of a sudden.
[57:17.420 --> 57:18.100]  I'm intrigued.
[57:18.840 --> 57:21.220]  Hey look, the space is like your clothing.
[57:21.700 --> 57:21.960]  Gavin!
[57:24.000 --> 57:24.840]  Oh my god.
[57:26.220 --> 57:27.520]  Were you even trying?
[57:27.760 --> 57:28.140]  Yes!
[57:29.820 --> 57:32.480]  Try harder, dude. That was pretty interesting.
[57:33.740 --> 57:35.020]  I gotta give it to you, Gavin.
[57:35.080 --> 57:37.120]  You think interesting is over with?
[57:37.120 --> 57:39.440]  Wait, why did you do it twice?
[57:39.700 --> 57:41.360]  Wait, why did you do it twice?
[57:41.640 --> 57:42.360]  Oh my god.
[57:42.520 --> 57:44.140]  Oh my god.
[57:44.580 --> 57:46.320]  Oh my god.
[57:46.320 --> 57:48.960]  Okay, take back everything I said.
[57:49.860 --> 57:51.320]  That was the most interesting move.
[57:52.140 --> 57:52.780]  Shut up.
[57:53.280 --> 57:54.360]  Shut up.
[57:54.780 --> 57:55.660]  You've won.
[57:56.740 --> 57:58.520]  Gavin is a master of interesting.
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.880]  Gavin, what did you do?
[58:01.480 --> 58:03.140]  I was trying to be interesting, you know?
[58:03.180 --> 58:03.480]  Dude.
[58:07.620 --> 58:08.980]  Nick, Nick, what happened?
[58:09.560 --> 58:11.680]  I think Gavin just made an enemy for life.
[58:12.520 --> 58:14.720]  Nick, Nick, I have to ask a question for you.
[58:14.860 --> 58:15.300]  No!
[58:16.440 --> 58:17.600]  Are you kidding me?
[58:17.680 --> 58:18.960]  Shut up, you asshole!
[58:19.320 --> 58:20.680]  What the fuck?
[58:21.940 --> 58:24.460]  Nick, where would you rate your interest level right now?
[58:24.640 --> 58:26.320]  Oh, it's through the roof!
[58:30.600 --> 58:32.200]  That was crazy.
[58:32.420 --> 58:33.520]  Why did you get to do it twice?
[58:34.080 --> 58:34.960]  Because I got Rachelita.
[58:35.600 --> 58:36.240]  Oh, shit.
[58:36.400 --> 58:38.520]  I didn't know she let you do that twice, that's wild.
[58:38.640 --> 58:40.840]  She lets you do everything twice, that's why I hold ass to boo.
[58:41.040 --> 58:42.820]  Why did you take it from me two times?
[58:42.900 --> 58:44.680]  You could have fucked me and then fucked someone else.
[58:45.260 --> 58:46.860]  I don't know, you were pretty close to that star.
[58:47.320 --> 58:49.100]  Did somebody hit me with a cursed ice block?
[58:49.520 --> 58:49.780]  Yes.
[58:51.880 --> 58:53.420]  Go back and watch the video, dude.
[58:53.820 --> 58:54.300]  I need to.
[58:55.240 --> 58:56.440]  Watch Nick do that to you.
[58:57.600 --> 58:58.380]  It was Geoff.
[58:58.900 --> 58:59.820]  I don't think it was me.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.120]  It was definitely Geoff.
[59:01.660 --> 59:03.300]  Why would I curse Andrew?
[59:03.700 --> 59:04.660]  That doesn't make any sense.
[59:05.740 --> 59:07.440]  He bought me a dilly bar.
[59:07.620 --> 59:08.980]  Either lose three or give ten.
[59:09.100 --> 59:10.020]  You're an idiot.
[59:11.500 --> 59:12.980]  Why would you do that?
[59:13.880 --> 59:14.400]  Why would you?
[59:16.620 --> 59:19.620]  I feel bad a little bit
[59:19.620 --> 59:21.000]  because it was Andrew and Geoff
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.320]  who shat on my move and I don't think Nick did too much.
[59:23.580 --> 59:24.980]  No, but I was wrong.
[59:25.180 --> 59:26.280]  I admit, I was completely wrong.
[59:26.920 --> 59:28.340]  I was also wrong.
[59:28.340 --> 59:29.180]  Hey, cool.
[59:30.040 --> 59:31.640]  Hell yeah, dude.
[59:32.120 --> 59:33.380]  You should just put it right there.
[59:33.600 --> 59:35.520]  Hey, Eric, you want to play Mario Party?
[59:36.000 --> 59:36.700]  Fuck no.
[59:40.760 --> 59:41.400]  It's the ball.
[59:41.760 --> 59:43.720]  I built this character for you, I'll sell him to you.
[59:44.980 --> 59:45.540]  Oh, shit.
[59:48.380 --> 59:50.580]  Well, I know who you shouldn't take it from.
[59:54.460 --> 59:55.260]  The opportunity.
[59:55.260 --> 59:57.000]  Let's let chance determine.
[59:57.000 --> 59:57.540]  Oh, my God.
[59:57.620 --> 59:58.260]  Yes!
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.700]  Mario Party is the best game I've ever played.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.400]  I love Mario Party so much.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.500]  Holy shit.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.900]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.600]  Oh, get fucked, Nick.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.060]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.620]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.460]  I think I have something to add to the P's draft.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.100]  Oh, no fucking three.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.280]  Everyone against Nick.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.580]  This was a very interesting turn overall.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.240]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.680]  This is the funniest game.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.780]  This is the funniest game in the world.
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.680]  This is genuinely the funniest game in the world.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:50.600]  I...
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.040]  Feel free to...
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:52.420]  There you go.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.580]  I'm thinking about sleeping in a few days.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.360]  I just...
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.620]  I'll go blue.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.580]  I'm going green.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.760]  Oh, shit, I went green.
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.120]  You guys are idiots.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:11.680]  There you go.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.340]  Ow.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.080]  Can he change up
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:16.840]  into the last minute, though?
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.060]  No, I don't think so.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.560]  I pick, I die.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.360]  I pick, I die.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.980]  Let him pick first before you say where you're going, genius.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.120]  Alright, I'll go blue.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.680]  I went purple.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.060]  Nick has zero coins.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.720]  Please just let me have it.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.900]  We're gonna make sure he doesn't get any.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.340]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.760]  Why are you lying, Gavin?
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.420]  I was lying
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.340]  so Nick would think I went there.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.260]  Wow.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.680]  You're an idiot.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:48.860]  You're the worst.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.360]  Alright, I'm gonna go yellow.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.280]  Where shall I go?
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.100]  I'm gonna go blue.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.140]  Alright, I'll go green.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:00.960]  Goddammit!
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.040]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:02.660]  Yes!
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.000]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.820]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.200]  You guys suck.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.680]  No, not you guys.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.220]  Not you guys.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.680]  I'm gonna invest this 10 cents
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.080]  into kicking your ass.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.840]  But the first time, I didn't
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.740]  say where I was going and you called me an idiot. How was I
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.260]  to know you were going?
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.900]  You didn't say where you were going when we were all saying where we were going
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.960]  so we could coordinate it.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.600]  I didn't know if Nick could hear us.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.000]  Did you say you don't know if I can hear you?
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.300]  No, I didn't know if you could move until...
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:36.740]  Oh, forget it.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.640]  Alright, stop it.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.940]  And there you have it. Turn 8 in the books.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.760]  Day 8 is done.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.360]  And Nick, how's the board looking?
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.080]  Oh, it's great.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.460]  Let's take a look.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.880]  I'm close to the star. I could get it if I got
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.280]  9 or 10.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:52.740]  10.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.160]  And then you guys are all clustered together.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.120]  Looks like Geoff can catch Rosalina
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.680]  if he passes Gavin.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.620]  Donkey Kong, of course,
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.400]  can go through and get
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.540]  his additional 10 coins.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.360]  And you guys have 2 Bowser spaces coming up.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.480]  Nick, I hope you can find
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.100]  another 10 coins between
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.460]  where you are and the star.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.260]  Geoff, I don't blame you, but that one
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.000]  coin will cost you.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.960]  And chance
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.240]  was wrong.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.460]  See you tomorrow.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.520]  I'm nervous.
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.620]  That's creepy.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.180]  Yeah, I'm intimidated.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.200]  Watch out for your crust, Gavin.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.220]  Oh my god. Watch out for my breasts?
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.200]  Your crust!
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.240]  Oh, sorry.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.760]  Oh my god.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.300]  Oh, what hath
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.960]  thou wrought? Nick, I have a question.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.420]  What has the last 24 hours
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:50.620]  been like in your head?
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.300]  Oh, they've been good.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.440]  They've been really good.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.380]  I mean, he's only 11 away.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.020]  What a position to be in.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.220]  I'm feeling pretty confident.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:01.760]  Yeah, lower.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.640]  What is that?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:04.760]  That way.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.260]  Never mind.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.740]  What's he gonna get?
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.740]  What is that?
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.040]  Oh, cool.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.680]  Alright, Wario time.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.280]  Who's behind me?
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.220]  Oh, Geoff is right behind you.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:24.680]  Yup.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.540]  Gavin's gonna roll a 6
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.620]  and Geoff is gonna roll a 2.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.160]  Wow.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:32.800]  Are you bailing out?
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.300]  Dude, you should lay pipe.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.160]  I might have to lay some pipe here.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:38.920]  Yeah.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.260]  What would be bad?
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.060]  She leaves in one turn, by the way.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:43.760]  This is all for nothing.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.820]  How's it all for nothing?
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.220]  Yeah.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.260]  She'll be gone before you get anything out of her.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.900]  If I walk...
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.080]  If I stole her, I would...
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.260]  I'm just saying, she'll be gone before...
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.080]  Oh, for you.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.500]  That's not entirely true.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.940]  Running from me probably doesn't make much sense.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.420]  You could land on a Bowser two times.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.680]  I'm gonna do an absolute Hail Mary
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.960]  and just hope that I get to Nick.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.860]  I think that's the way to do it.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.040]  I like it.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.620]  I think this is the right move.
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.380]  Where's he gonna pipe to?
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.380]  Alright, let's lay pipe.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.260]  Go to Geoff, go to Geoff.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.780]  Yes! No! No!
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.640]  Oh, wow.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.200]  Oh, no way.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.540]  Oh, no!
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.260]  You're in the wrong lane!
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.000]  Oh, it put you in the wrong lane.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.140]  Wait, who is here?
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.360]  No one.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.100]  I don't think it swaps you with anyone.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.020]  It's just a random location.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.000]  Wow, Gavin.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.900]  Gavin, that was so close.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.020]  Well, now you just want a low roll.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:48.360]  Yep.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.000]  Here's what I want. Andrew, put the low roll on me
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.600]  so I can't get the star in the next turn
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.560]  and then we'll fuck Gavin.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.940]  I need less than a...
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.220]  I don't give a fuck what you want respectfully right now.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.480]  I got my own problem.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.620]  I appreciate you telling me what you want.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.500]  I don't care.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.220]  Andrew, you're not following me.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.980]  He will buy a star if I get this star
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.940]  in this next turn.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.260]  Therefore, you can stop me from getting a star
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.060]  in this next turn.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.720]  He'll be past it
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.320]  and then I can get the star.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.240]  You'll still be in a good position
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.260]  to be in second or first.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.700]  Yeah, Andrew, why don't you get Nick the star?
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.860]  What don't you understand?
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.820]  I'm going to get the star no matter what.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.500]  It's just whether you want to give it to Gavin.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.720]  He's going to roll a 10 and it's not even going to matter.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.520]  I hope you roll a 58.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.760]  I'm hoping for a low roll as well.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.640]  I don't really understand Nick's pitch.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:42.740]  Yeah.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.640]  I don't understand.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.520]  It doesn't matter.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.240]  It's not necessary.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.260]  It's fine.
[01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:56.430]  I was real excited about that too.
[01:06:57.590 --> 01:06:59.690]  I've been rolling too high this game.
[01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:00.970]  Yeah, that's tough, man.
[01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:02.530]  Here's Dilkong.
[01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:04.270]  Here's Dilkong.
[01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:07.790]  With a laying down a little trap for you guys.
[01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:08.670]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:10.130]  A little 10 coin trap.
[01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:15.030]  And now whoever comes through here can choose to land on this place just like you did, man.
[01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.710]  Pretty cool.
[01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:18.010]  A little lucky spot for you so it's not all bad.
[01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.810]  And now let's do a little dice-a-roo-ba.
[01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.770]  Oh!
[01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.610]  Oh, the deal is moving.
[01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.170]  We're on the run.
[01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:29.730]  Give me the coins.
[01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:33.910]  That is my payment back for landing on the space originally.
[01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:38.830]  Okay, lose those coins.
[01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:40.110]  Hell yeah.
[01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.070]  Every roll with you is just a roller coaster, man.
[01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:46.650]  It's me.
[01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:47.810]  Everybody's favorite mole.
[01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.550]  You know what?
[01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.130]  Geoff, you are my favorite mole.
[01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.470]  I think you might be fucked.
[01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:55.250]  Oh, you just made it.
[01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:58.030]  Okay, so the top gives you items.
[01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:59.230]  The bottom gives you coins.
[01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.990]  Yep, yes.
[01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.430]  Oh.
[01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:02.290]  Oh.
[01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:05.270]  Stop making noises.
[01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:06.390]  Shut up.
[01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:09.310]  Pick one and shut up.
[01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:09.790]  Gross.
[01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.930]  The mole is not known for having a depth of intelligence.
[01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:14.290]  It's struggling here.
[01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:16.390]  I hate the noise the mole makes.
[01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:18.890]  It's fucking gross.
[01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:22.370]  Can you imagine being parked behind the mole just trying to move?
[01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:23.030]  Go!
[01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:24.970]  Pick a road!
[01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:28.150]  And we have a...
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:29.110]  Oh!
[01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:31.110]  Alright, Gavin.
[01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:32.570]  Let's do this, Andrew.
[01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:34.830]  I feel good about this.
[01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:37.410]  I don't feel good about this.
[01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:40.590]  We've only ever tied at this.
[01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:41.690]  We've never had a winner.
[01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:43.110]  There's never been a winner.
[01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.670]  I'll let you take lead, Geoff.
[01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:47.810]  You've cooked more meat than me in real life.
[01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.550]  Oh, that looks surprisingly good.
[01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:54.050]  These are some good looking steaks.
[01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:56.570]  Alright, you stand still there.
[01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:58.730]  I'll modify...
[01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.070]  Like that?
[01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:01.650]  Sure.
[01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:04.510]  I think we're feeling okay about that.
[01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:05.310]  Mm.
[01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:07.790]  Tough, tough, tough. I don't know.
[01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:09.550]  I'm used to doing it one person.
[01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:10.450]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:13.110]  Let's come...
[01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:16.270]  Let's say...
[01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:17.950]  Go left a smidge.
[01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:21.130]  Good smidges.
[01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:22.170]  Good smidges there, boys.
[01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:24.470]  I'm gonna be honest, I don't feel good about either of these so far.
[01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:25.030]  Nope.
[01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:27.330]  The practice round was way better.
[01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:29.650]  Just kind of middle this bit.
[01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:32.450]  You go there and I'm gonna go...
[01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:33.370]  I don't like...
[01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:35.930]  Just a hair to your right.
[01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:38.010]  Hair to your right.
[01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:39.150]  No, too far.
[01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:40.130]  I disagree.
[01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:42.930]  There's disagreements on the other side.
[01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:45.970]  Yeah, I don't know about this.
[01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:46.430]  Wow!
[01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.970]  Okay.
[01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:52.010]  Nails on the side of the foot.
[01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:53.670]  Wow!
[01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:55.690]  Geoff, you should have just done it by yourself.
[01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:56.670]  Wow!
[01:09:57.150 --> 01:10:00.470]  That was nuts how Andrew was most concerned
[01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.390]  I think about the exact 50-50 cut.
[01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.810]  Yeah.
[01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:06.030]  He had that one dialed in.
[01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.270]  Wow!
[01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.490]  So when you've cut 15 steaks preparing
[01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:10.190]  it doesn't stop.
[01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:15.790]  I have a new restaurant!
[01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:17.610]  He has just enough coins.
[01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:18.370]  He did it.
[01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:20.930]  I was trying to be real quiet
[01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.690]  about that one.
[01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:24.590]  Guys, we're moving to
[01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:26.430]  turn 10. Getting one
[01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.430]  third of the way through as Rosalina
[01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:30.770]  will leave. She's out of here.
[01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.550]  I'm excited to see
[01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:34.690]  where we go. Nick, show us
[01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.570]  the board. The board!
[01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:38.550]  Well, I
[01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.830]  have five spaces to go to get a star.
[01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:42.770]  Gavin is past the star
[01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:43.710]  no matter what happens.
[01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:46.530]  Geoff is
[01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:47.290]  close to go.
[01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.650]  This is Monopoly apparently.
[01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.050]  Let's see here. Dilkong
[01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:54.570]  you get to go on the second track coming up
[01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:54.950]  here soon.
[01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:58.870]  He's closing in on his second star.
[01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.930]  I'm excited.
[01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.250]  Yeah, I'm excited. Guys,
[01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:04.650]  thanks for watching this one. Will we
[01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:06.530]  tailsync? Only one way to find out. It's
[01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:08.450]  watching to the end of this. We'll see you tomorrow
[01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:09.770]  for day 10.
[01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:12.710]  We're one third of the way
[01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.270]  through. God, incredible.
[01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.410]  Alright, see you next time. Bye!
[01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:16.190]  Bye!
[01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:19.630]  You should have killed me when you had the chance.
[01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:20.590]  Oh my god.
[01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.490]  Rosalina's
[01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:26.370]  out of here. Nick
[01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:28.030]  has everyone in his sights.
[01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:30.410]  This is crazy. He's
[01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:31.690]  got 20 coins.
[01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:34.430]  I'm worried that something interesting might happen on this turn.
[01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.390]  Oh no! I'm a little worried about
[01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.710]  this.
[01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:40.470]  Guaranteed star for Nick!
[01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:42.530]  He's doing it.
[01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:44.010]  No, that's not necessarily true.
[01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:46.230]  Oh, it is 5. You're right.
[01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:47.490]  Woohoo!
[01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:52.170]  He's done it.
[01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:54.450]  Yay! Congratulations, Nick.
[01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.590]  Are you sure you want to spend all your coins, Nick?
[01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:58.790]  Yeah, now you're out of coins.
[01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:00.830]  Now what are you going to do with coins? Now you need coins, though.
[01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:02.690]  Okay, well I'll get coins.
[01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:03.450]  What if you get hungry?
[01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:05.710]  I'll eat the star.
[01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:08.710]  Have you considered what if you get hungry?
[01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:10.890]  I'll eat the star.
[01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:13.010]  Okay, where's it going?
[01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:14.070]  Oh, wow.
[01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:16.670]  Now,
[01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:18.850]  I've run the numbers last
[01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:20.830]  night, and I've determined that
[01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:22.970]  Nick's still going.
[01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:25.030]  I've determined that something quite interesting could happen
[01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:26.130]  if I roll a 10. Yes!
[01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:28.010]  Oh my god.
[01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:31.050]  Geoff, if Nick's hungry, he has
[01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:31.990]  15 coins to spend.
[01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:34.030]  They answered my question.
[01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:37.150]  I just want to bring up, this being day 10,
[01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:39.110]  we've been playing this session of Mario Party
[01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:41.330]  for 240 hours at this point.
[01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:42.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:45.330]  We sit here the rest of the time
[01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:46.730]  and watch it on the pause screen.
[01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.210]  Alright Gavin, what interesting
[01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:51.210]  thing are you thinking of? I want a 10
[01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:53.470]  but I do not want a 5, 6
[01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.750]  or a 7. Okay.
[01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:56.590]  That's quite the gamble.
[01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:58.870]  I'm going to see if
[01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:00.030]  I can get a 10.
[01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:01.490]  5.
[01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:03.290]  Alright.
[01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:07.290]  Is something interesting happening still or no?
[01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:08.770]  Not this turn.
[01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:10.470]  Nobody accepts it, mate.
[01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:13.290]  I see what he's thinking.
[01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:14.750]  What am I thinking, Nick?
[01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:17.990]  I'm thinking that he shouldn't do it.
[01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:21.210]  Well, Nick,
[01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:23.390]  obviously I'm open to bribes and all that.
[01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:25.290]  Yeah, send him
[01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:27.290]  ice cream or whatever. So far I've got
[01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:28.870]  a dilly bar, that's it, and a star.
[01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.390]  What are you hungry for today?
[01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:33.410]  A 10
[01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.430]  for turn 10!
[01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:35.990]  What a celebration!
[01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.990]  Ooh, are you going to spend?
[01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:40.690]  Let's see what we've got in here.
[01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:42.290]  Oh, you can get
[01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:43.850]  quad dice.
[01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.610]  Big time.
[01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:48.490]  Wow, they're nice looking.
[01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:50.670]  Yeah, that's a potential 40.
[01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.510]  You could potentially
[01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:53.730]  move 40 spaces?
[01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:55.530]  What the fuck?
[01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:57.830]  I'm getting those quad dice.
[01:13:58.410 --> 01:13:59.910]  That's like almost two stars.
[01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.570]  If you have enough coin
[01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:03.430]  it's like two stars.
[01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:05.090]  You just keep going.
[01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:08.610]  You could do the funniest thing
[01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.970]  in the world on the next turn.
[01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:12.830]  I would argue
[01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:14.430]  the funniest thing in the world has already happened
[01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:15.010]  in this game.
[01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:18.690]  Well, here's two
[01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:20.670]  funny things that could happen. One,
[01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:22.770]  Gavin could blow the whistle
[01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:24.650]  and move the thing to the next track
[01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:26.730]  and then he could steal a star from you
[01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:28.610]  and then he could steal a star from you
[01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:29.230]  on top of that.
[01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:31.130]  You know who else has a star?
[01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.790]  Nick does.
[01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.830]  Yeah!
[01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:37.290]  This is our most landed space.
[01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:39.490]  I can't believe it.
[01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.070]  Please get another one of those.
[01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:42.330]  We need to keep that trap.
[01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:45.290]  Two is a lot.
[01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:46.070]  Guys!
[01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.750]  It's not even on there.
[01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:49.610]  Hey!
[01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:51.690]  It was worth it, Geoff.
[01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:55.190]  Alright, well that was my turn.
[01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.090]  Alright, minigame time. Let's see what we got, boys.
[01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:57.610]  Oh!
[01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:01.790]  And a free-for-all.
[01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:03.330]  Nick could be eating good.
[01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:04.390]  Platform peril.
[01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:07.370]  Hot, hot, hot, hot.
[01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:08.970]  What was that?
[01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:11.690]  It sounded like Gavin
[01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:12.690]  trying to spell thank you.
[01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:14.130]  How about this?
[01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:17.210]  What do you mean?
[01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:19.370]  What?
[01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:21.650]  Alright, here we go.
[01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:22.750]  Gavin trying to spell what?
[01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:25.210]  Doesn't have a lot of the same letters.
[01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:27.690]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:31.090]  I almost ran straight into it.
[01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:32.130]  I ran straight into it.
[01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.710]  Well, poor Nick.
[01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:39.930]  Oh my god.
[01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:44.450]  Gavin's pissed.
[01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:47.170]  Mario kind of has a whole
[01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:48.330]  franchise around jumping.
[01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:50.090]  Not a great show.
[01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.350]  Shit!
[01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:54.790]  What happened?
[01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:58.350]  Geoff got thrown walls.
[01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:59.430]  God damn it.
[01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:01.110]  Gavin just had to hang out.
[01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:02.470]  That was ridiculous.
[01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:05.610]  He avoided you at all costs.
[01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:07.050]  He didn't even have to do anything.
[01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:10.870]  That might be the quickest
[01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:12.170]  turn of Mario Party we've done.
[01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:13.510]  I think so.
[01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:16.330]  Alright, there's this ending.
[01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:19.230]  Nick, we gotta have a look at this board
[01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:21.150]  because going into turn 11
[01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:22.890]  a lot can change.
[01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:24.530]  Something interesting can happen.
[01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:27.030]  Let's set the stage for some interesting stuff
[01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.830]  tomorrow.
[01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:30.630]  So Gavin
[01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:33.110]  has to get past the next three
[01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.830]  spots.
[01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:36.970]  And then he'll be safe from jumping
[01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:38.230]  over where Boo is.
[01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:39.110]  How many spots
[01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:42.190]  are you from Boo?
[01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:44.530]  Let's see.
[01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:47.010]  Gavin is six spots away
[01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:48.190]  and I'm seven.
[01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.790]  If you use your
[01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:52.850]  mushroom ticket, you can probably just get it on this
[01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:53.730]  next turn, huh?
[01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.810]  That would be pretty interesting. Turn 11 is
[01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:59.170]  turning out to be pretty interesting.
[01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:00.950]  Is that the interesting thing you thought would
[01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.010]  happen, Gavin?
[01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:03.410]  Is that Nick would get another star?
[01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:06.870]  The interesting thing I was hoping would happen would be Nick gets the star
[01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:08.010]  and I immediately steal it with Boo.
[01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:11.070]  I had a
[01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:12.190]  feeling that might be the case.
[01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:14.990]  But obviously with Nick coming up
[01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:16.570]  on Boo, I would never do that.
[01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:17.390]  Of course.
[01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:18.190]  Excellent.
[01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:21.530]  I have an idea I might want to pitch you, but I'll send it to you
[01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:23.610]  in a message from the delivery service.
[01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:24.230]  Interesting.
[01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:26.530]  It's getting interesting.
[01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:29.550]  If you want to
[01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:30.870]  send it in a box of sandwiches.
[01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:33.650]  What's your favorite
[01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:34.710]  sandwich place?
[01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:37.170]  Supreme Pizza at a party.
[01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:38.190]  Oh my god.
[01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:41.330]  We'll see you guys next time.
[01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:42.550]  Thanks for watching. Bye!
[01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.450]  Bye!
[01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:43.870]  Bye!
[01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:46.530]  I feel good about all you guys.
[01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:48.530]  Yeah, that's what you say right now.
[01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:49.770]  Give it four seconds.
[01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:52.630]  New turn.
[01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:53.910]  Turn 11.
[01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:56.810]  We've had a little bit of a deal-making session.
[01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:58.350]  I'm sorry, you've...
[01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:59.350]  Turn 11?
[01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:01.330]  There's a deal-making session?
[01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:04.210]  I might have had a little chat with a friend.
[01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:05.850]  Interesting.
[01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:09.550]  I think this could be
[01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:10.930]  a very interesting turn.
[01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:13.970]  I think you told us about him
[01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:15.130]  on 100% Eat
[01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:16.870]  you said that you wouldn't talk to him in public.
[01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:18.070]  That's not what I said.
[01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:21.250]  I said we were surprised to see each other in public.
[01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:26.290]  Did we see each other in public?
[01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:29.290]  Like a year and a half ago.
[01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:33.150]  He's like, I didn't want to talk to him.
[01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:34.430]  I thought it would be weird.
[01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:37.010]  We run podcasts together.
[01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:39.530]  Well, we didn't yet.
[01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:42.450]  Get away, get away, get away.
[01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:46.390]  A year and a half ago you weren't
[01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:48.470]  three and a half years into fuckface with him.
[01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:49.650]  Geoff, right?
[01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:52.210]  But I wasn't, you know...
[01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:54.750]  Jesus Christ.
[01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:56.590]  Uh-oh.
[01:18:57.170 --> 01:18:57.890]  No way.
[01:18:58.450 --> 01:18:59.730]  It's a long turn today.
[01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.610]  Bring it to me. Give it to me.
[01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:03.670]  I want them coins back.
[01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:05.690]  I instantly regret this decision.
[01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:09.290]  I forget every time
[01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:11.670]  we all play these and my head is always like a 1v1.
[01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:13.110]  I thought so too.
[01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:17.830]  It's the versus I think that really gets me every time.
[01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.510]  To me, a versus is like a 1v1.
[01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:20.270]  Not in the Olympics.
[01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:22.330]  That's true.
[01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:25.050]  This is the closest competition to the Olympics.
[01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:27.390]  They're always saying that.
[01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:29.310]  It's really...
[01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:31.330]  I can't wait for the Koopa Kingdom to be allowed
[01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:33.070]  back in after their cheating scandal.
[01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:35.670]  I honestly don't think they should be allowed back in.
[01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:36.770]  Oh my God.
[01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:38.690]  What is this?
[01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:39.410]  What?
[01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:41.990]  You have to be on a...
[01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:43.530]  It's a bunch of different deals.
[01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.930]  Pedal mole. Pedal. Dumbass mole.
[01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.090]  Go. Pedal.
[01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:50.170]  What are you talking about? I'm in first place.
[01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:53.910]  Wario just said okay.
[01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:55.150]  He doesn't give a shit.
[01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:58.150]  I see a lot of practice coming in.
[01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:58.670]  I've seen enough.
[01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:01.950]  Yep, me neither.
[01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.470]  Alright boys.
[01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:06.510]  If you're watching at home,
[01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:07.890]  place your bets now.
[01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:09.090]  Go. Go. Deal.
[01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:12.530]  Pedal time.
[01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:13.570]  Pedal time.
[01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:15.970]  What are you doing?
[01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:17.530]  Mario, what are you doing?
[01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:19.910]  Trouser busted.
[01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:22.510]  Dude, Mario sucks.
[01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:24.290]  I fell apart.
[01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:25.270]  Oh mole.
[01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:27.690]  Oh mole.
[01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:30.610]  Go. Go. Who's third?
[01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:32.110]  Come on.
[01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.890]  You can still get third.
[01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:44.230]  I fell apart
[01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:45.110]  with the motion.
[01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:48.110]  It was so unintuitive to me.
[01:20:49.190 --> 01:20:50.030]  Swim was like
[01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:52.330]  flip flap and then pedal was like
[01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:53.190]  wiggle wiggle.
[01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:54.590]  That doesn't help.
[01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:58.250]  You know how they tell you to put that strap
[01:20:58.250 --> 01:21:00.390]  on before every minigame so you don't lose your...
[01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:03.510]  First time I ever lost my controller.
[01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:08.250]  I was swimming and I still came inside.
[01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:10.510]  And you still came inside.
[01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:12.310]  Alright, so
[01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:13.330]  rolling.
[01:21:14.410 --> 01:21:15.350]  Hold on. Don't roll yet.
[01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:15.770]  Remember?
[01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:20.770]  Nick Rockhard.
[01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:21.370]  Do you remember?
[01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.350]  I wonder who Nick spoke to.
[01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.930]  Do you remember?
[01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:27.790]  This is so funny.
[01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:29.570]  I wonder who Nick spoke to.
[01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:30.290]  3
[01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:33.830]  Shut up. Don't bring me into this.
[01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:35.470]  1, 2, 3 would be bad.
[01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:37.830]  Nick could have been talking to Andrew there.
[01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:39.470]  Nick, we're not even talking in public yet.
[01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:40.330]  Don't even try it.
[01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:44.710]  What is this?
[01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:47.770]  He's moving the star.
[01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.730]  Because I was in position to get it.
[01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:52.410]  Theoretically.
[01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:54.390]  I see.
[01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.870]  Okay.
[01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:58.910]  Was that what you guys agreed on?
[01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:00.890]  I think so.
[01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:04.370]  And now I'm going to get booed, I assume.
[01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:08.050]  Was that good?
[01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:09.450]  It might be next turn.
[01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:11.030]  But it's not green.
[01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:14.410]  Alright, well, it's a semi-interesting turn today.
[01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.930]  We had a versus minigame.
[01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.730]  What are you talking about?
[01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:20.270]  Very interesting turn today.
[01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:22.910]  My doors are going to be open
[01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:24.930]  this evening if anyone wants to come in and have a chat.
[01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:26.390]  I heard about these dice.
[01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.950]  In the comments.
[01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.490]  You heard about them?
[01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:32.570]  What did you hear?
[01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:34.870]  They operate differently than dice.
[01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:35.790]  What does that mean?
[01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:37.370]  There's four of them.
[01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:38.830]  He gets gold wheels.
[01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.890]  Not great.
[01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.210]  He's going to get booed.
[01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:45.230]  Yeah, but not when you have four.
[01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:48.290]  Oh, he passed boo.
[01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:51.510]  It won't stop on anything.
[01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:52.630]  Oh my god!
[01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:54.550]  That's crazy.
[01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:56.810]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:57.510]  That's crazy.
[01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:00.570]  I just wanted more spaces.
[01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:02.790]  I didn't roll a one.
[01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:05.030]  Geoff is closest to the star then.
[01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:06.150]  Hey, shut up over there.
[01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.270]  We don't need that.
[01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:11.850]  Nobody asked for that commentary.
[01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.330]  Oh, okay.
[01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:15.630]  So, potentially, if I didn't move the star,
[01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:17.050]  would Andrew have just blown through it?
[01:23:18.690 --> 01:23:19.750]  I'd use that
[01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:20.650]  because you moved the star.
[01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:21.490]  Oh, okay.
[01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:24.790]  Alright, minigame. Let's do it.
[01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:26.890]  You didn't waste it. It was worth it.
[01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:29.910]  It is a three on one.
[01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:31.890]  Oh, the mole against the world, baby.
[01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:33.950]  I'd hate to be you guys right about now.
[01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:35.570]  It's a coin game.
[01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:38.750]  I'm a streamer now, too.
[01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:39.810]  I stream every day.
[01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:41.290]  This is going to be a problem for you guys.
[01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:44.430]  This guy's a Warzone streamer.
[01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.990]  You can tell.
[01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:47.750]  Watch the way he locks in.
[01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:48.830]  What do we...
[01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:51.650]  Oh, we get his dregs.
[01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:53.410]  Yeah, you gotta get all those, Geoff.
[01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:54.370]  Oh, okay.
[01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:56.750]  We're working together.
[01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:58.630]  Aren't we?
[01:23:58.970 --> 01:23:59.950]  Yeah, we are.
[01:24:02.130 --> 01:24:03.690]  That sounded like horse shit.
[01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:05.630]  How did you guys catch up to...
[01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:06.230]  Oh, there you go.
[01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:08.590]  I think Geoff controls his pedaling.
[01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:10.030]  What?
[01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.150]  Did you crack the code on that, bud?
[01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.510]  Yeah.
[01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:17.370]  Yeah.
[01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:19.530]  Yeah, we'll see, I think.
[01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.890]  Okay.
[01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:23.050]  So far, so good.
[01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.370]  Ow, don't slap me.
[01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:28.270]  I was trying to knock Mario off.
[01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:31.810]  They're sporting around him.
[01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:33.450]  Ow.
[01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:35.530]  Ow, Geoff.
[01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:37.290]  I can't turn left.
[01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:40.690]  What do you mean?
[01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:41.930]  It just wouldn't turn.
[01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:44.310]  Get that little son of a bitch out of the way.
[01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:46.650]  What do you mean by that simple statement that's easy to understand?
[01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:49.170]  It didn't make any sense because I watched you turn left.
[01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:51.090]  As I was figuring it out.
[01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:53.110]  That was a pretty bad minigame.
[01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:55.950]  I only got seven coins.
[01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:57.610]  I genuinely didn't like that one.
[01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:00.090]  I was excited about this turn last night.
[01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:01.370]  Been thinking about it.
[01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:03.770]  And I feel like I'm just gonna be thinking about it again tonight.
[01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:04.650]  Nothing really happened.
[01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.350]  Yeah.
[01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:07.590]  I disagree.
[01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:10.550]  I disagree pretty strongly that nothing really happened.
[01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:13.070]  I got robbed for nearly half my coins.
[01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:14.970]  Then you moved the star that I could have gotten.
[01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:16.590]  Well, I mean.
[01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:18.670]  Oh, nothing really happened.
[01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:20.310]  Wario first place.
[01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:22.350]  Wario's loaded.
[01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.930]  Yep.
[01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:24.930]  It's happening.
[01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:27.150]  That might be the time.
[01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.530]  Yeah, we don't know if it's her tomorrow.
[01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:31.150]  It's exciting to see what could be.
[01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:33.010]  That's true.
[01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:36.270]  Excited to see what can happen on turn 12.
[01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:37.110]  Wow.
[01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.350]  Wow.
[01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:40.950]  It did save, right?
[01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:43.730]  Yeah, but we have to end with the board.
[01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:44.510]  Yeah.
[01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:47.150]  Oh, she's way up ahead.
[01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:49.110]  Geoff is closest to her.
[01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:53.150]  Double star scenario potentially for Geoff.
[01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.630]  Wow.
[01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:56.010]  And he's been rolling better of late.
[01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:59.690]  So, DK, Mario, and Wario
[01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:01.330]  are all clustered together.
[01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:03.170]  So we're all in danger of
[01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.970]  crossing over two Bowser spots.
[01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:06.730]  Gavin still has Boo coming up.
[01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:08.090]  Assuming he doesn't roll a one.
[01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:11.150]  And Geoff can start to run away with this thing.
[01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:13.650]  Run away? I haven't even started walking yet.
[01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:14.350]  What are you talking about?
[01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:16.310]  Well, see, you're gonna walk into a run.
[01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:19.050]  Suddenly, everybody's in danger of Geoff.
[01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:21.630]  I'm deeply in last place.
[01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:22.790]  You know, I've not been
[01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:24.470]  looking at Geoff this whole game.
[01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:26.270]  Because I'm in fourth place.
[01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:27.630]  I'm in the rear view mirror.
[01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.330]  You guys are only looking forward.
[01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:31.050]  It makes no sense to look behind you.
[01:26:31.690 --> 01:26:33.330]  You're about to use our jet stream
[01:26:33.330 --> 01:26:35.230]  to pass all of us.
[01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.170]  See you tomorrow.
[01:26:36.490 --> 01:26:39.510]  Get ready. It's starting tomorrow.
[01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:40.270]  A dill turnaround?
[01:26:40.690 --> 01:26:42.130]  A dill turnaround is happening.
[01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:45.550]  I think Geoff is gonna, like, really take the lead on this next turn.
[01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:46.750]  I'm excited to see turn 12.
[01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:49.470]  I don't need you doing any of that right now.
[01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:51.150]  I don't need to be under...
[01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:53.650]  It's already bad enough over here in Geoffville.
[01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.370]  We don't need the ire
[01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.110]  of three idiots pushing me for...
[01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:58.930]  I can't be in eighth place. There's only four slots.
[01:26:58.930 --> 01:27:00.610]  Well, find out
[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:02.890]  if Geoff can make it to eighth place
[01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:04.570]  when we come back and do this tomorrow.
[01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:06.370]  We'll see you next time. Bye.
[01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:07.150]  Bye.
[01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:09.350]  Turn 12.
[01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:13.070]  We're back well rested and ready
[01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:14.470]  going into turn 12
[01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:15.730]  in Waluigi.
[01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:17.030]  Whoa.
[01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.050]  I wonder if it's in a different spot as well.
[01:27:21.330 --> 01:27:21.970]  Interesting.
[01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:23.830]  Ooh.
[01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:26.310]  Steal a bunch of coins.
[01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:27.010]  It is.
[01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:29.850]  Oh, it's right in front of us.
[01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:32.150]  Wow. Peach teas.
[01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:33.490]  Uh-oh.
[01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:36.050]  Ooh, are you going to use it, Nick?
[01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:38.090]  Use it, Nick.
[01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:40.330]  I'm a little worried about Bowser.
[01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:41.550]  Use it, Nick.
[01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:43.450]  All right. You convinced me.
[01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:45.530]  Peer permission.
[01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.970]  No, that one was pressuring.
[01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:48.130]  Straight up bullying.
[01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:51.370]  Peer permission.
[01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:53.890]  That's all Nick needs is peer permission.
[01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:56.550]  I mean, yeah, when this is something I want to do.
[01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:57.310]  Wow.
[01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:59.370]  God, what a roll.
[01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:02.170]  Did that work out for you? Did peer permission get you right?
[01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.630]  Wow.
[01:28:04.170 --> 01:28:05.610]  And five coins.
[01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:06.250]  Wow.
[01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:09.150]  Wow.
[01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:11.490]  Waluigi game. Wow.
[01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:13.470]  I've never been the one who gets the money.
[01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:13.710]  Wow.
[01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:18.050]  I want to win this minigame and get him.
[01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:20.070]  So you have a Wario
[01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.910]  Waluigi
[01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:22.390]  War Brothers
[01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:24.590]  Why did you say it like that?
[01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:27.310]  Gavin only slept
[01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:28.090]  all right last night.
[01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:33.450]  Oh, God.
[01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:36.730]  How can you even see?
[01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:38.130]  Against
[01:28:38.130 --> 01:28:40.630]  the UK's biggest pinball
[01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:42.630]  fan in Gavin. Jesus Christ.
[01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:45.010]  Okay,
[01:28:45.130 --> 01:28:46.850]  let's do it. All right.
[01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:49.150]  Do you think
[01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:51.150]  you'll open a pinball museum someday, Gavin?
[01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:52.070]  Do you think that'll be your retirement?
[01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:54.190]  No. That'd be pretty cool.
[01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.030]  Let's get a little yes and go in here
[01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.790]  in the morning. No.
[01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:02.270]  Have you ever tried moving one? Suck.
[01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:05.210]  Well, I mean, you can redesign it.
[01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:05.430]  Whoa, medals.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.660]  All right, here we go. Waluigi time.
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.040]  All right, come on, Nick. You got this.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:14.840]  Waymo.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.000]  How do I tilt?
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.040]  Yeah, I don't think you do. I think it's just
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.220]  a left and a right. I don't think it's
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:21.900]  full on. You know what I'm saying?
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.020]  Oh, Nick.
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.040]  Yeah, no good.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.100]  Oh, it's a Waluigi time.
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:30.920]  Where the hell's the ball?
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.600]  Whoa, shooting right up the middle.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.100]  Waluigi time.
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:36.980]  Who played
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.000]  Waluigi when you guys would play Mario stuff
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:39.640]  in Achievement Hunter?
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.100]  Balls. Did somebody pick Waluigi?
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.380]  Was he like a choosable guy?
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:47.560]  You'd have to ask Gavin.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.300]  I don't remember shit.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.120]  I was trying to ask everyone.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.080]  Well, they weren't in Achievement.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.320]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.220]  Right, so who else
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.640]  do you think that question went to?
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.160]  I assumed it went to me
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.980]  and Gavin, and I don't know the answer.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:03.700]  That's what's happening.
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:06.660]  So it'll have to be Gavin that answers it.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.920]  Yeah, I'm hoping it will be, but here we are.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.920]  Yeah, but Gavin didn't sleep great last night.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.160]  He only slept okay, so he's not very responsive.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.140]  I heard Gavin didn't
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:15.780]  sleep very good.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.420]  He slept alright.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.460]  God damn it.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.360]  I think Joe is super into Waluigi, right?
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:25.680]  Known for it?
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:30.960]  Whoa, more medals.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.340]  I thought I was doing so good
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:39.420]  and I looked at everybody else's screen for the first time.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.720]  And was quickly brought back to Earth.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.460]  I thought Nick was doing really good
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.060]  and then I looked at everyone else's screen also.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:48.300]  Yep.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.360]  I'm not good at...
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.100]  Do you have the advantage here, Nick?
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.680]  I guess so. Here's the thing.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.260]  I don't like the control for this.
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.900]  It feels too late every time I press.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.020]  It's delayed as shit.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.180]  Go sooner.
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.260]  For everybody, not just for you.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:06.200]  Okay, well.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.300]  I'm also bad at pinball.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.000]  So how's that?
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.440]  Me too. I'm really bad at pinball.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:14.020]  Ink me up, baby. I don't care.
[01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:14.960]  I'm just mashing.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.280]  There you go.
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.460]  Dude, you're right there, Nick. You're actually in this.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.660]  Can one be neither good nor bad at pinball?
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:23.260]  Just...
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.440]  Like medium?
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.480]  I'm whatever that is at pinball.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.520]  What the hell is this?
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.440]  Give me that Waluigi. He's my guy.
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.740]  Is there a final score
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.420]  Is this where we're trying to get to or is this just time?
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.400]  It's an amount of time.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.160]  A long amount of time.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.180]  Yeah, you have 30 seconds.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.080]  When Emily and I do the random mini-games, this is the one
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:45.960]  that comes on and she goes, ugh.
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:49.420]  Ever.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:49.920]  Come on, Nick.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:50.800]  Oh!
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.900]  Fire, Nick. Fire. Fire.
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:55.340]  Yeah.
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:58.800]  There you go.
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:31:59.760]  Fire, Nick.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.960]  Can't see a god dang thing.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.680]  You don't need to see shit. Keep firing.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.100]  Pull the trigger, Nick. Pull the trigger.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:07.920]  Oh my god!
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.960]  Give me that Waluigi, baby!
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:10.600]  No!
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.040]  Nick, I really thought you had that.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.060]  Andrew came through.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.800]  Gavin fumbled hard.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.660]  No tilt and he got tilted.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.300]  This is not good.
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:22.960]  Pinball Dillard.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:26.620]  So did you pull it near us?
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:27.660]  Okay.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.140]  Oh, you're right by...
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:30.880]  Oh!
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.020]  That's good for the grabbing.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.300]  Yeah, but Nick moved 15 spaces.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.580]  Oh, Nick's still going, I guess.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.180]  Yes, he is.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.320]  He's got like 10 more to go.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.780]  Yeah, I get to go while sad.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.460]  12. Oh my god.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:47.760]  Oh, big decision.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.820]  Do you want coins or do you want items?
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.500]  You don't have any items, right?
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:54.800]  Why did I go there?
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:55.320]  I don't know.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.420]  Showed you exactly where you were going to.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.360]  Yeah, sure, why not.
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:00.940]  Fill her up.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:02.380]  Fill me up, baby.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.220]  Whoa, look at him.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.300]  Turbo dice?
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.220]  Oh my god.
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:12.200]  Six dice.
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:14.020]  Wow.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.820]  Eight dice.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.460]  Dude, this is a...
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:21.880]  That's a game changer, dude.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.760]  That's wild.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.880]  That was way more than the industry average of three seconds.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.960]  That's a mean turn.
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:30.060]  Okay, you're fine.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.680]  I don't want to give them to anyone.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.740]  I think it's less than three seconds these days.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.940]  Yeah, Red Bulls are like 2.6.
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.100]  Nick just got an achievement.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.240]  Congratulations, Nick.
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:42.340]  Thank you!
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.240]  29 more and you can unlock some maps.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:46.820]  Oh!
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:48.760]  Oh, boo!
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.140]  He's got all the money in the world.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:54.480]  This is interesting.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.960]  So, who shall I steal from?
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.160]  Don't steal from Geoff.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:03.200]  Geoff got a negative one.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.240]  He's in the hole.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.920]  Working my way back up to zero.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.040]  I don't know, who do you think is more in first here?
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:12.880]  Do it random.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:14.960]  I could do random.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.840]  Let chance decide.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:18.980]  You're a motherfucker.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.940]  You son of a bitch.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:21.900]  Wow!
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:24.460]  I thought it would be like a whole spin thing.
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:26.420]  Wow!
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.220]  I may have not hit random.
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.480]  Yeah, I don't think you did.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.140]  Do you think you were attempting to hit random
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:38.180]  and hit the wrong button or did you just hate Nick?
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.260]  I think I would have preferred you hit the random.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:42.000]  Because at least then
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.600]  I know that you just didn't ignore our deal.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.280]  To be fair,
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.140]  there is a whole other game going on
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:50.600]  in the meta where Wario does not like Mario.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.820]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.240]  And I really like Waluigi.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.500]  That's why I took him.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.360]  For one turn.
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.860]  Now this is my thinking.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.920]  This could easily blow up in my face
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:05.920]  and I could roll too low.
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:08.780]  I want Waluigi and I want to create a little separation
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.680]  between us.
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:11.640]  That's exactly what I was thinking.
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:13.520]  Roll a one.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.100]  That was good.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.220]  That was actually what I needed.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:20.580]  That was a crazy choice.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.480]  Now which way?
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:22.620]  You want the money?
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.260]  I want the money, man.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.540]  Give me that money.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.480]  That's the most landed on spot.
[01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.620]  It's the third time we've ever trapped it.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:32.960]  Crazy.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.400]  And you're making money.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:35.900]  I am.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:40.100]  Oh, I get to do it twice.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:40.540]  I forgot.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.160]  Oh, that's right. You get two.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.360]  I was wondering why you had such a big smile.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:45.760]  Oh, nice.
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:48.240]  At least if you'd done random,
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.240]  I could have been like,
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:52.220]  oh, it's just the way the game is.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.580]  I thought you two had a whole alliance
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:55.860]  or something last turn. What happened?
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.360]  Well, guess what? Not anymore.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:00.060]  I'm going to do this for fun.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.200]  Just see who gets it.
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.940]  Oh, I got to do it to myself?
[01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:04.840]  You're an idiot.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.320]  Why would you not put it on Andrew?
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.660]  It would have been the funniest
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:11.640]  to put it on Andrew.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:11.840]  No!
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.720]  You suck.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.060]  You fucking stink out loud, dude.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.860]  You suck ass.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:20.960]  Come on!
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.840]  You fucking suck shit.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.440]  What is this game?
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:28.040]  What the fuck is this game?
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.980]  You fucking tripped over your own dick
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.260]  into a pile of shit.
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.760]  What kind of random is that?
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.440]  What a moron.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.020]  What the fuck is that?
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.800]  That is some nonsense.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.580]  Don't fuck this up, Nick.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:44.880]  You can only roll one to three now.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.640]  I just did it.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.800]  Geoff, do you know how to do this?
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:50.320]  I do know how to do it very well, thank you.
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:50.860]  Okay.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.540]  The timing on that was pretty special.
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:58.520]  There you go. You guys got it.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:36:59.040]  Easy.
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.860]  Jesus Christ.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:02.980]  We got this, Gavin.
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.060]  Let me just hit the random.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.120]  Here we go.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:08.800]  What?
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:10.500]  We're going to the right, Geoff.
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.500]  You gotta be holding up, buddy.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.760]  What's the...
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:18.340]  Nick!
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:19.240]  Gavin!
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.140]  That was on Nick.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.520]  Big style on Nick.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.020]  There you go. Get in the rhythm, boys.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:27.420]  Nick, get your head in the game.
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:29.260]  Gavin!
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.600]  What's happening?
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.480]  Oh, wow.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:33.920]  Gavin!
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:38.420]  Marimole going all the way.
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.660]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.240]  He refused to grab on the way up.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:44.160]  There we go.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:45.920]  Nice job, Geoff.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:46.960]  Good job, Nick.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.120]  An early stumble, but a huge win for Marimole.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:52.820]  Gavin continues his streak of not winning any minigames.
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:57.380]  What do you mean?
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.400]  I just got slippery hands.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.740]  All right, well, have a look at these standings,
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.480]  because this is where we are.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:05.680]  First place, Wario.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:06.560]  Damn.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.120]  Big style.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:10.800]  Going into turn 13.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.340]  A lot has changed. Alliances broken.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.280]  Nick, let's have a look at the map
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.420]  and see where everything stands.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.760]  Look at this. Gavin has danger coming up.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.920]  He's only going to roll one to three.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.760]  And that will place him squarely
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.140]  either in a chance time space
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:27.020]  or Bowser.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:29.840]  Bowser Revolution would be pretty good.
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:31.960]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:34.060]  It looks like Monty Mole
[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:35.320]  could also do the same,
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:37.280]  as he has event spaces in two and three
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.720]  and he can roll a one to three
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.320]  that he did to himself.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.600]  I already got hit with my punishment.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.600]  Oh, did you?
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.600]  Oh, I thought you had it on the next turn.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.360]  I was so worried.
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.640]  I'm like, oh, you're boned.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.600]  I mean, that star is far,
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.540]  but a couple of big rolls
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:56.260]  and it's right there.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.980]  Let's see. 27 away from me.
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.460]  Same as me.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.760]  There it is. Well, guys,
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.400]  big one today going into turn 13.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:06.880]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.340]  Well, exciting to see where this one goes
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.640]  and we'll see you next time. See you tomorrow.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:11.280]  Bye!
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.440]  Turn 13!
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.540]  My God.
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:18.480]  Oh my God, Geoff.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.420]  I think this is going to be a big turn, potentially.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.420]  The problem is it's not a one-time occurrence.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:24.780]  It's like the fourth time I've done it.
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:26.640]  In the last three months.
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:28.020]  Let's go, Mario!
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:31.220]  Is there any way I can get you to forget about what happened yesterday?
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:33.120]  Oh.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:34.180]  No.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.020]  Now, if it helps, he had forgotten
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.000]  what had happened.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.540]  What you have done has reminded him.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.340]  It's all Nick has been thinking about.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:45.280]  I woke up in the middle of the night last night, couldn't get back to sleep,
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.880]  and I thought, that motherfucker.
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:49.660]  Now I know what was going on.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:51.500]  Before everybody got here earlier,
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.460]  Eric was trying to soothe Nick
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.160]  with pictures of chicken parm sandwiches.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:55.680]  It didn't work.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:59.580]  Back at an item shop.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.280]  You have money to spend, too.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:01.940]  I do.
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.540]  Oh, and you can get more quad dice.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.040]  What are you going to buy?
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.820]  Nick, do you want some free advice?
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.720]  Uh, sure.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:13.360]  Oh, never mind.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:17.600]  I did, but you were too slow.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.120]  Yeah, take that, Gavin.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.580]  I used to have a friend
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:24.020]  who used to sell advice in Monopoly.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.120]  That's pretty good.
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.200]  What was his fee?
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:29.080]  Isn't he just a financial advisor?
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.420]  Ten bucks.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:34.140]  Someone bloody cursed me.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.180]  Yeah, I didn't want you to steal Waluigi.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.240]  I was trying to get a little lead on you after getting...
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.360]  So, Gavin, if you roll a one, you're safe.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:42.480]  If you roll a two, I think you get
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.140]  the exchange thing, and if you roll a three,
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:44.680]  you're on Bowser.
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:48.380]  Two on the dice are gonna make us in a duel.
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:50.580]  I feel like the last thing I want
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.220]  in this game is chance time at this point.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.160]  Ah, I think I'd like it.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:57.720]  Pipe pipe pipe pipe pipe pipe...
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:58.500]  I don't really want to pipe
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.440]  on a three, though.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:03.920]  But the pipe would take you away from danger.
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:05.140]  Maybe.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.880]  Or puts you right into worse danger.
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.480]  Or could put you right into something
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.480]  special and cool.
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.340]  It might drop you right in Bowser's asshole.
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:15.780]  You don't know.
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:20.320]  It's what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna roll this stupid block because I kind of want to...
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.120]  Hit up that store, and I want to go away from it
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:28.480]  Okay, he wants the store. There's that store in the pit lane that gives you a shitload of stuff
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.140]  See what's gonna happen
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.920]  Are we going to Bowser, or are we having to just...
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.820]  Please, oh
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.440]  That's the worst thing that could've happened
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.740]  That is awesome
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.080]  I mean you could still land on it tomorrow
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:42.200]  What a limp noodle. That's true
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.980]  Oh, Mr. Interesting Turn didn't get something interesting
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.580]  Yeah, you got it. Yeah, you got a real big style, baby. Give me that mushroom ticket
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.320]  You got more? Thank you
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:59.840]  Man, everyone's shrooming. Go get me some of these. Yeah, it's like when I use that thing, I'm like micro dosing these things
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:01.840]  Fuck
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.400]  Well, I wanted it to be a lot higher than that
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:13.320]  Do you think you could go up into somebody's anus with a tiny camera and install it on the head of a poop that hasn't
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:18.300]  Fully formed yet so that when the poop eventually comes out you can see the world
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:22.960]  As the poop is birthed the same way it does. Not only do I think that that could be done
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.520]  I think I could do that to you
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:31.220]  That's beneficial, Andrew. That would be interesting. That's like a little insta 360 camera. That's like a pill
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:33.880]  I don't I don't think it would be that interesting
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.100]  But I get what you're getting at
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:39.640]  Has anybody ever thought about what a poop's first breath is like? No
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.240]  I imagine it's its last
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:47.500]  Combination of words has never gone in that order in my entire life. I agree with Andrew. It's like I'm a lot. I'm drowning
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:53.060]  All right. What do we want to do? Do we want to hit the dice block and go a couple spaces?
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.620]  I usually roll like dicks
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:55.080]  Oh no!
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:58.080]  Man, the mole is moving
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:00.600]  That's a lot of spaces. I got money to spend
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.840]  Hey Geoff, you want some free advice?
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:04.080]  Yeah, what's up?
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.960]  Oh, I don't know. I'm teeing up Gavin
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.200]  Oh, Gavin, you got any free advice for me?
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:09.220]  Got none
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:11.580]  How about $5 advice?
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:16.540]  Okay, no, no, I'm not looking to pay for it. Okay. All right. Well, thank you anyway
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:21.480]  Wait, did you not buy anything? Oh, you did. Okay. I did buy something. Okay. Oh good, good call
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:27.120]  This is good Geoff, this is real good. Oh
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.280]  This is bad. Yeah, this is great. This is real bad. I lost three. Oh no. Well, no Geoff and I could
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:36.500]  Teamed up to be old teammates. To be two. I think it's gonna be solo. Geoff and I
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.780]  Oh, Geoff and I!
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:41.400]  Oh, we got team animal over here
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:48.080]  How is that? How are the teams determined? The maria, the waria. Uh, blue spaces, red spaces, and if it's green, it's 55
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:52.480]  Oh, I see. Keep all the coins you collect. All right Gavin, I'm gonna put aside our differences. Let's get these coins
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:58.600]  I think... I think the economy was good enough. All right, Andrew. We just have to outsmart those two. What do we tactically...
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.140]  What do we do?
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:07.160]  For each button held down. Stop. So we've held, we've held down four. Got it. So to do a full rotation
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:10.220]  Yeah, so you want that.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.080]  Oh, OK.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.780]  All right, Nick, can you figure this out?
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:14.240]  Nope.
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:17.640]  He's putting aside differences.
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:20.320]  All right, we want it. We want it to be a two total.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:20.640]  Two.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:24.780]  Get off, Andrew.
[01:44:32.370 --> 01:44:33.250]  Well, all right.
[01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:37.590]  Nick's on a little bit of a delay, I think.
[01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:39.030]  Yeah, to his brain.
[01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.670]  This is going to be pretty exciting.
[01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:40.830]  He's fine.
[01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:44.710]  Let's give it a...
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:53.600]  Oh, wow.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:56.080]  That worked out pretty well, Gavin.
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:58.820]  That's OK. They're going to blow up here sooner or later.
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:02.000]  This is pretty good. I like teamwork, but without saying anything.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:02.680]  This is pretty cool.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.440]  This is Ted's shit hole.
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.140]  Yeah, I don't know what to do.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:08.320]  Just staring him down. I'm staring down this bomb.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:09.440]  Oh.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:13.520]  Fuck. Damn.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.380]  I tried to get off.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:16.300]  I tried to get off, too.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:20.840]  Team Animal is not doing great.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:21.300]  Oh, listen.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:24.580]  We're trying to understand these human concepts in games.
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.720]  We just want to be eating bugs off each other's backs.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.660]  I want nothing to do with this round.
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:32.520]  I'll tell you that.
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:37.100]  You fools!
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:39.760]  Excellent.
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:40.800]  Damn it.
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:42.060]  Look it up for the animals.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.580]  It's tied.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.040]  Oh, oh, my God.
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.740]  Oh, I like Gavin's strategy.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.240]  This is good.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.040]  In pin, safety pin.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:56.880]  There you go.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.400]  Nice.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:01.340]  Good play.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.040]  Sorry, I probably got off there.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.560]  Now, let's see.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:17.940]  Oh, balls.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:19.780]  Oh, it worked out.
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:20.460]  Fine.
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:21.980]  Why'd you jump off, Nick?
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:25.680]  Because I thought they were going to jump back on and get a bomb.
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:27.360]  Last round.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:28.340]  Here it is, boys.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.000]  All right. Does nobody get on?
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:31.200]  Yeah, it's easy.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:33.360]  You guys can just hang out.
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:38.660]  Uh-oh.
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:42.040]  Why?
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:43.560]  Could have jumped on there, Andrew.
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.360]  Why would you do that, Geoff?
[01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.600]  Well, I think he was assuming I'd do a hop on as well.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.360]  I was going to assume Andrew would have hopped on, too.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.680]  We would have got three choice because we had to get coins to win.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:56.280]  We had no shot to win unless we got more coins.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:57.940]  This was the craziest.
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:03.320]  I want people to go back and study how there was like non-communicative teamwork.
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:04.980]  Like, that was crazy.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:05.480]  That fell apart.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.300]  Yeah, that was really something.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:08.800]  I'm happy with my three coins.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.240]  Really, we could have, we could have.
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:13.420]  There was a lot more coins on the table there.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:14.820]  We could have, we had access to.
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:15.020]  You know what?
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.400]  I'm not greedy.
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:18.520]  I like the three I had.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.300]  I don't think it's greed when you've got a teammate.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:21.380]  I don't think so either.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.200]  What a weird turn.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.500]  What a weird turn.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.460]  Let's see.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.600]  Geoff, you and I have a chance to get a star next turn.
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:32.260]  Hell yeah, brother.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:32.940]  Hell yeah.
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:34.360]  I'm 12 away.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.360]  That means you're 11 away.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.360]  Although yours will probably switch if I get there before you.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.520]  And Gavin's in the real danger zone now.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.880]  Because he has the swap token and then two bowsers to get past before anything else.
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:50.560]  And then DK's following up pretty close behind us.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:52.580]  So, got some stuff going.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:55.960]  Bye.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:56.820]  Alright.
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:47:59.960]  That's it.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:01.720]  That's the outro.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.380]  And cut.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.160]  It's turn 14.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:06.340]  We're almost halfway.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.180]  Almost halfway.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:08.740]  Today's going to be a good one, boys.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.480]  I can feel it.
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:12.000]  Geoff, what will happen today?
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:14.680]  I don't know, but my nipples are extra hard.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.580]  So that means something good for me.
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.480]  Well, you have no shirt on?
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.260]  You know, I'm topless, baby.
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:21.500]  T-O-P-L-E-S-S.
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:22.080]  You'll do it.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:23.640]  Come up here, you'll do it.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:25.520]  That'd be a great tattoo across the chest.
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.220]  Yeah, you'll do it.
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:32.160]  Triple eights, I think, would have been an achievement, actually.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.740]  Nick, what a whopper.
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.260]  Wow, that's a big one.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.200]  Nick's got a star in his immediate future.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:40.720]  And you know what, Geoff?
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.580]  You might, too.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:42.920]  Aw, shucks.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.220]  You might, too.
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:47.800]  I'm the second guy.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.620]  Wait, I'm the first guy to buy two stars in this game.
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:50.460]  I'm the second.
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:51.020]  That's true.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:51.960]  Congratulations.
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:52.500]  Way to go, man.
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:53.580]  That's cool.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:54.700]  Moneybags Nick.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.320]  It's my second star.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:57.540]  Yeah.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.680]  I had star in the brain.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:00.060]  I would say I bought a star.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.000]  Yeah, you sold your soul for it.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.180]  Look at that, Geoff.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.560]  It's exactly where it needs to be.
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.200]  You made an enemy for the rest of this game.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:08.360]  Yeah.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:09.720]  This is still the first half.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:11.400]  Oh, no, Boo!
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.000]  I'm gonna miss Boo!
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:14.480]  That's pretty funny.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:15.580]  Damn it!
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.260]  I would have...
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:16.960]  That's funny to me.
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:18.360]  Wait, what did you want to do with Boo, Nick?
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:20.860]  Oh, what did I want to do with Boo?
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:21.320]  I don't know.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:22.300]  Nick, look.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.480]  We're still in the first half.
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:24.460]  We can still reconcile.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:25.980]  That's true.
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.600]  There's a lot of talk of reconciling from the guy who wrecked the whole thing for you.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:30.560]  That's very interesting.
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.080]  I wrecked the style.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.340]  If I were you, Nick, I'd say things are even once he gives you a star.
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:38.720]  Yeah.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.600]  That'd be my reconciliation.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:42.260]  I hadn't thought about reconcile and...
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:43.160]  I'll give you a star in the 29th turn.
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:46.160]  Reconcile and reckon style is kind of like...
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:46.840]  That's pretty cool.
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:51.180]  Gavin's like, that would be an Achievement Hunter shirt right now if we still worked it.
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:51.280]  Yeah.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:51.820]  That would be great.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.000]  Man, today's a crazy eight day.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:55.480]  Oh, which way?
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.340]  Do I want to go there, or do I want to go...
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:02.380]  I don't really care about the coins, so I'm going to almost get to the store, I guess.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.800]  I love almost going to a store.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:09.700]  Yeah.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.020]  If you could almost go to a store in real life right now, what store would you almost go to?
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:16.500]  Costco.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.560]  Almost going to Costco is pretty good, dude.
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.020]  By the time you got there, it'd be open.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:21.780]  That's such a good answer.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.300]  It's a great answer, because it opens in an hour.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.920]  You know the thing about Costco?
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:29.280]  They let you in early.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.200]  If you show up 30 minutes before they open, you can just walk in.
[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:32.960]  They don't care.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:33.680]  I've done it.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:34.420]  I saw it on TikTok.
[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:35.420]  I've tested it out.
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.240]  It's totally fine.
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.980]  It opens when you want it to open.
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:39.120]  It's your store, too.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.500]  You know what?
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:46.340]  When COVID was happening, they did a thing where they opened an hour early for all the old folks to come through.
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:46.940]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.160]  It was real sweet.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:51.100]  I'm about six months away from qualifying.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.380]  Qualifying for early Costco?
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:56.380]  Yeah.
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.880]  You getting some ARP magazines or what?
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.100]  I haven't started yet.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.040]  I heard you're supposed to get them around this time, but I have not.
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:09.320]  I think it's a good idea to start applying to old people's homes and hospices and stuff.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:09.660]  Dude!
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:17.360]  There's a neighborhood up north of here called Sunset Valley.
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.640]  Is it Sunset Valley?
[01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:20.460]  It's something like that.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:22.840]  And it's north of Pflugerville and Round Rock.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.860]  And it's an old folks neighborhood.
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.060]  It's like an over 50 and up community.
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:33.520]  It's just like a regular neighborhood where I live, but you have to be over 50 to live there.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.460]  I could fucking qualify to live in that place.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:36.680]  Wow.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:38.760]  You should do it.
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:39.940]  I was joking about it with Emily.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:43.760]  I was like, how would you like to move here and be the youngest person by far?
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:44.560]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:46.180]  Andrew, why'd you do this?
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.180]  Move me down.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:49.940]  Let's head down this road.
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:51.280]  Why didn't you want to get the star?
[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:52.800]  Oh, I see.
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:55.320]  Is he gonna boo?
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:59.760]  Because I wanted an achievement called add insult to injury.
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:00.580]  Clearly, Eric.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.480]  Andrew, what was your...
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.900]  What's the move here, Andrew?
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:06.340]  What was that?
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:08.480]  He did because...
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:16.780]  So if he went to the lower level, Geoff probably would have passed him taking Waluigi and gotten the star.
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:20.020]  So I guess I get the logic by not going that way.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:24.260]  So now Geoff's gonna get the star and then take Waluigi.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.160]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:27.160]  Especially with these rolls.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:28.280]  Oh my God.
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:30.500]  Holy Jesus, Geoff.
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:31.100]  What?
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.920]  I told you my nipples were extra hard today.
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:37.320]  I could go that way, it's 59 to the star.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.720]  If I go this way, it's nine to the star.
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:40.640]  So if I go...
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:42.720]  I'm saving 50 by going this way.
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:43.760]  Oh, what if he accidentally switches?
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:44.700]  Okay, there you go.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.420]  Oh, man.
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.140]  I'm gonna go ahead and buy this.
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:47.660]  You got it.
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:49.460]  Congratulations, Geoff.
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.040]  Thank you.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.600]  Everybody's on the board now.
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.000]  Way to go.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.300]  Which one of you will steal it from me first?
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:55.460]  What if you steal something from them first?
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:56.020]  Probably Gavin.
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:57.560]  What if you, like...
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.000]  What if you become first place Geoff?
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.200]  Dude, I already stole the only thing that matters.
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:05.420]  I stole Gavin's heart.
[01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:06.220]  Wow.
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:07.540]  Aww.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:08.800]  Can I have that back?
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:11.140]  Put on a shirt and sell it at Achievement Hunter right now.
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:12.680]  Gavin stole Geoff.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:16.240]  You'll get your heart back when I get my fucking car back.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:16.600]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:18.460]  You might be landing on Boo here, actually.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.120]  I think he's gonna get Boo on this turn, isn't he?
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:20.800]  Well, we'll see.
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:22.920]  I think he is.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.180]  And he's taking all the EGs.
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:27.460]  And if that's the case, does that mean he steals two?
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:28.340]  I think he may.
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:28.760]  Good.
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.520]  Oh, goodness.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.140]  I have just the first one.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:36.720]  So, if I pay 50 coins, I can steal a star from one character.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.600]  Yeah, I know just the guy.
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:41.640]  But I have Waluigi, right?
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:42.920]  So, two of them.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:44.660]  So, it might take two.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:45.580]  It might, yeah.
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:49.660]  Which heavily influences my decision on which character to take a star from.
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:51.020]  So, I'm gonna break it down for you guys right now.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.940]  Nick is Mario, he has one star.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.480]  Gavin is Wario, he has two stars.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:58.020]  That's true.
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:01.740]  Andrew is Dilkong, and he has one star.
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:06.140]  So, for me to fully take advantage of the Waluigi double star ability,
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:10.500]  I'm going to have to take a star from the evil version of Mario,
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:12.220]  which happens to be played by Gavin.
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.820]  Now, you will have to pay both times, though.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.400]  Well, I don't have the money to do that, so I'm just gonna get the one.
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:19.160]  You can get coins the second time.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.080]  That's kind of bullshit, though.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:20.680]  That's true.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:21.540]  What's happening here?
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:24.020]  Oh, yeah, it's licking the star away.
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:25.100]  Is that what that is?
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:26.740]  Well...
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:29.040]  There goes my star.
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:31.560]  Everyone's just trading Nixels and stars.
[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:36.220]  Oh, you can steal coins.
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:37.380]  I guess I just took coins.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:38.220]  Yeah.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.520]  Now, you do have the opportunity to do a very...
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:43.580]  No!
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:45.880]  It was just random.
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:47.100]  It was just random.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:47.980]  You can't be mad.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:48.720]  I let chance decide.
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.020]  I can still be mad.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.680]  I feel great right now.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.440]  Be mad at Boo, don't be mad at me.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:56.740]  Ooh, 11.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.380]  Nice job.
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:00.000]  That was a rough turn for me.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:02.820]  I feel like Nick is really gonna pay for that turn.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:03.360]  What?
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.560]  I feel like he's gonna pay for that.
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:06.460]  You know what I realized?
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:08.300]  I know why my nipples...
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:10.240]  I know why my nipples were so hard earlier.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:10.500]  Why's that?
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.960]  Because I got a star for each one.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:12.600]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:12.900]  Wow.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:14.880]  Also, Waluigi just does that to you.
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.460]  You forgot.
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:16.480]  He was coming.
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:18.080]  You just sensed it.
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.540]  Fourth to first.
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:20.400]  Crazy first place, Geoff.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:21.800]  Decent fucking round for me.
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:26.300]  By doing your weirder move, Andrew, you prevented him from getting two stars?
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:30.580]  No matter what I did, he was gonna take Waluigi and end up there.
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.480]  So if you took him after the star, at least he could get two.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:34.740]  That's true.
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:44.600]  I think his thought was it would be two 20 coin stars versus one star that he plays 20 and the other one the 50 that he steals from someone else in the game.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.380]  Which is 70 if you add that up.
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:47.040]  Right.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.360]  It's a math problem.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:51.280]  I'm on top of the math today, boys.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:51.640]  Don't worry.
[01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:52.620]  Sweet.
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:53.520]  After yesterday.
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:58.320]  All I remember is doing this once before and not paying attention at all.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.800]  And I still don't.
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.020]  This one is just a random luck question.
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:04.100]  I'm gonna go first.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:05.600]  Okay.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:06.500]  Oh.
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.520]  Easy order.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:10.640]  Going fourth is not bad.
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:11.820]  Well, let's see.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:15.040]  So he's gonna take the middle key.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:16.700]  He's gonna go to the right.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:17.180]  Surely.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:18.340]  What?
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:20.060]  Well, that's some horseshit.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:20.560]  Whoa.
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:21.760]  Wow.
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:23.200]  That's a lot of scrawl-ups.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.200]  Jesus Christ.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:26.160]  Holy shit.
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:28.800]  That was nuts.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.320]  Fuck that.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:33.700]  Well, that's not where that key goes, idiot.
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:34.500]  Shit.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:36.560]  Oh, no.
[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:36.900]  No.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.860]  That key obviously goes here.
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:40.640]  Obviously.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:41.700]  Oh, this is gonna be good.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:42.820]  Yeah.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:43.800]  Told you.
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:44.860]  Oh, my God.
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:46.840]  Oh, my God.
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:48.120]  What is this?
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:49.400]  This game's insane.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:51.800]  This game is...
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:54.540]  If he goes straight through this frickin' door, I'm gonna...
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:57.660]  Alright, Gavin.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.620]  It's two, Gavin.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:00.880]  50-50 chance.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:01.760]  50-50.
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:03.640]  No way it's the first to first, right?
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.440]  Oh, it could be, though.
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:06.680]  The square or the bowl.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.460]  You think it's a ball?
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.180]  Oh, this could be it.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:11.560]  You know what?
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.160]  We did it.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:18.020]  I'll just have to reconcile myself on the two stars I got today, I guess.
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:19.300]  Oh, great.
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:20.340]  Not a bad turn, Geoff.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.000]  Left in the graveyard.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:21.860]  Not a bad turn.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:24.860]  So, wait.
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:26.280]  What was the point of everyone else doing it?
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.900]  That is a terrible minigame.
[01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:28.980]  Wait, so what was the point of everyone else?
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:32.020]  Yeah, I thought we were gonna do another round, and then it would just progress.
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:34.500]  Because everybody else gets coins.
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:35.660]  I...
[01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:36.460]  Fuck that.
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:37.300]  Like, I don't...
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:40.440]  That wasn't worth three coins, though.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:41.740]  That wasn't worth it.
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:42.660]  Building.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:43.080]  Yep.
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:45.220]  Okay.
[01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:46.040]  Bye, Waluigi.
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:46.440]  Bye, buddy.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:47.080]  Bye, buddy.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:47.940]  Thanks for the three coins.
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:48.800]  He did good work.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:52.300]  So, tomorrow, we say goodbye to Waluigi, and what else do we get?
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.460]  We officially hit the middle point of the game.
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:56.420]  Waiting.
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.400]  Can someone move it so we can look at the map?
[01:57:59.420 --> 01:57:59.900]  It's Geoff.
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:00.900]  It's Geoff's guys.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:01.420]  Oh, okay.
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.540]  Yeah, but what if he just sits here?
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:04.520]  He's counting his stars.
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:05.720]  All right, let's look at the board.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:07.420]  Hey, listen, I'm in first place.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.520]  I decide when we move forward.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:09.080]  That's true.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.560]  We're all pretty clustered together.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:15.480]  DK, though, if he doesn't roll one, two, or three, is well on his way to a boo.
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:21.740]  Geoff and I have to worry about the chance time space, and then two bouncers after that.
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:24.620]  Well, Gavin can get his items tomorrow.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.420]  I can't wait.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:28.400]  Maybe a star?
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:30.260]  I think there's going to be some big moves tomorrow.
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:31.680]  Andrew, what the hell was that turn?
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.580]  It was a great turn.
[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:36.220]  Listen, I understood what he did after he did it.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:38.060]  And I like what Geoff did, too, a lot.
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:40.720]  I don't think he understood what he did until after he did it.
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:46.740]  All that matters is that I know that I know that I know that I understand that I know that I did it.
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:49.940]  And I do know that I know that I did it, and I understood it.
[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:50.620]  Bye!
[01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:53.900]  You know, if one of you guys were to...
[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:54.780]  But hold on, before you leave.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:55.000]  What?
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:55.720]  I was just thinking.
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.700]  If one of you guys were to unexpectedly die today...
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:00.720]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:00.880]  That's me.
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:02.020]  I'm going to do it.
[01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:03.340]  We'd probably have to stop the game.
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:06.420]  No, no, it'd have to be one of the game players.
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:09.180]  We'd still be able to continue without you.
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:13.060]  But if one of the other game players were to die today, knock on wood, that doesn't happen.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:14.940]  I guess I would win.
[01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:16.280]  No, no, it would just be...
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:17.260]  I'm going to text Eric my wife's number.
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:19.720]  It would have to end where it ended, and I guess I would win.
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:21.020]  They would become AI.
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:24.080]  Yeah, computer plays for you from beyond the grave, sorry.
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.520]  That's disrespectful to their memory.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:25.940]  That's disrespectful.
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.040]  Thanks, computer, bye!
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:27.680]  It's dead.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.500]  Eric, you can have my Switch when I die.
[01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:30.280]  You want that shit?
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:30.620]  Bye!
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:31.780]  Bye!
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:33.260]  Sleep well, don't die.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:34.980]  Good morning, time for thing!
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.040]  It is halfway.
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.040]  Wait, oh my god, we already started.
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:41.340]  Oh, I just started seeing the screen.
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:44.020]  Oh, I thought there was one more turn with Waluigi.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.520]  No, he's gone again.
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:45.980]  He's gone.
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:47.080]  He's pissing right off.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:47.680]  Dang.
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.040]  He did his jab.
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:51.760]  He delivered me to first place, now he's going to get messed.
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:51.820]  It's true.
[01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:53.560]  First place Geoff, that's what they call him.
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:54.100]  Yeah.
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:55.780]  That's what I call him.
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:56.540]  Deja vu.
[01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:58.140]  Geoff, you've got to hit the aim button.
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:00.440]  Back to back.
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.200]  How do I...
[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:04.760]  What a weird place to end it.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:07.320]  You know what?
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:10.700]  Oh, you got a turbo?
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:17.080]  It seems unlikely that I'll roll four tens and fuck this up, so let's see.
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:18.440]  Maybe you'll roll four nines.
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:18.840]  You'll need a 35.
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.180]  Oh, wow, okay.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:23.340]  He is on the move.
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:23.960]  What a roll.
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.900]  Are you serious?
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:26.040]  See you all soon.
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:28.080]  He's far away from the star.
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:30.540]  Does it matter which way I go?
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:32.700]  No, I don't think so, because I don't think you're stopping for anything.
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:35.360]  Holy cow.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:36.800]  Nikolas.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.560]  It would be so funny if he landed on the space that pushed him away.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:41.440]  Oh, I didn't even think about that.
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:43.920]  Damn, and he got lucky.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:44.420]  Wow.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.920]  Dude, what a play.
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:48.680]  That is the move on this map.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:49.780]  Oh, and an item badge.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:50.260]  Wow.
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:52.820]  Dang.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.080]  Are you just going to get a shit load of shit?
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:56.920]  What a fucking turn.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.020]  Holy shit.
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.800]  Oh, you got the shop phone?
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:02.340]  I've never even seen that before.
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:04.840]  You can shop on the go, Nik.
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:08.340]  They'll do a pop-up wherever you want.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:08.880]  Wow.
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:11.520]  You're definitely getting a star on that next turn, then.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:12.440]  Yeah.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:13.880]  Wow.
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.440]  Unless Gavin uses the pipe.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:18.900]  Unless I pipe to somehow right before the star.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:20.840]  That would be upsetting.
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:22.120]  Please don't.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.780]  However, you're one space away.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:24.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.660]  I love me some items, so I'm going to just go...
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:30.620]  Well, you're lucky that's what you needed.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  Oh, brother.
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:34.540]  I'm having some ones.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.000]  I'm really...
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:35.940]  You are.
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:40.060]  I'm really mulling it for these mid-team turns.
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.680]  I don't know what mulling it means, because I'm in first place.
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.440]  Yeah, but you were mulling it in the beginning.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:45.220]  I'll take that.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:46.860]  Oh, Payday Double Dice is nice.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.240]  You got some good items, bud.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.160]  Fine.
[02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:55.200]  Gavin's getting loaded up, man.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:55.980]  That's me.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:56.980]  I wear the backwards hat.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:01.920]  All right.
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:02.560]  Dilkong.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:04.140]  It's Dil.
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:05.120]  He's all smiles.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.400]  Oh, is Dil going to Turb?
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:07.820]  Oh, you can Turb.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.080]  I'm not Turbing.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:09.780]  He's not Turbing.
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:11.740]  He's going to use this so he can go past Boo.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.060]  Oh, he wants to Boo.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.520]  This will be an interesting turn for Dilkong.
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:18.040]  Sure will.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:21.880]  Let's get a nice high roll.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:22.580]  Sure do.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:24.080]  Oh, wow.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:26.960]  A lot is happening here for Dilkong.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.320]  Okay, now is the time where you steal coins for free.
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:31.980]  Free coins.
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.040]  Free coins, dude.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:34.000]  It's pretty crazy.
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:35.680]  Don't need coins.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:36.480]  Okay.
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:38.820]  So who are you going to steal from?
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:41.660]  This is where it gets interesting.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:42.600]  It does.
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:44.400]  Andrew, I agree with you.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.720]  This is an interesting turn.
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:49.360]  Does anyone want to explain to me why I shouldn't take their star?
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:51.280]  Please don't.
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:55.580]  Nick, if I take your star, you immediately...
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:57.880]  Okay, what about this?
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.500]  If I don't take your star, are you going to immediately take a star from me?
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:02.340]  No.
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:04.620]  I'm not on the star taking train from you.
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:06.400]  There's someone else on my list.
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.540]  Yeah, he has his sights set somewhere else.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:11.660]  You have been removed from my sights completely.
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:14.960]  Why don't you just do random?
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:16.900]  Yeah, I'm okay with that.
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:19.220]  Why don't you just have it?
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.600]  Let's think about this.
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:24.500]  Alright, let's take it from Gavin, because he's the biggest threat.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:25.940]  He's the best one at the game.
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:29.820]  He's the one who's the most nefarious, who's putting the most effort into it.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.500]  So you're right. Instead of random, I say we just take it from Gavin.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.560]  I agree.
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:36.320]  Andrew, slit your throat in a second.
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:41.740]  Well, what a lot of you guys don't know...
[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:42.960]  If there was a star in your throat...
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:45.820]  ...is that Gavin and I have had a shadow alliance since turn six.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:46.280]  Oh no!
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:48.220]  Wow.
[02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:49.320]  But that ends now.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:50.400]  Oh my god!
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:55.680]  No! You said you wouldn't attack me until turn 20!
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:00.820]  You said I was safe for five more turns?
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:01.940]  You liar!
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:03.880]  You liar!
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:07.820]  It's all fair in the world of the party!
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:08.840]  What do you mean?
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.060]  Look at that big smile.
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:16.280]  Nick, you are safe for the rest of the game, son.
[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:19.020]  I know I'm not safe with you, but I am not touching you, Nick.
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:21.000]  All-time villain move.
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.820]  Oh my god.
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.680]  Nick is safe! Geoff is safe!
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.160]  Dilkong is dead!
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.140]  Oh no, Geoff!
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:33.560]  Oh no, Geoff!
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:34.180]  Okay.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.040]  I'm good, I'm good.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:39.120]  And that ends now.
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.380]  What a time.
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:43.800]  Alright, let's get some coins here, boys.
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:45.120]  Let's see how this minigame goes.
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:47.900]  Gavin, how you feeling?
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:50.620]  Well, deep down, I felt it coming.
[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:52.940]  But it hurt. It hurt even more.
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:53.700]  I understand.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:56.500]  You know what? I know that feeling very well.
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:57.360]  Yeah.
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:04:59.400]  Let's go horizontal.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:01.260]  I love going horizontal.
[02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:03.780]  Whoa, I don't think I've ever played this once.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:04.500]  What is this?
[02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:06.860]  Oh my gosh. Oh no.
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:07.520]  Okay.
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:08.560]  Oh, I see.
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:09.540]  Yup.
[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:10.500]  Alright.
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.500]  How do I boost?
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:13.180]  A.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.420]  A? I would think.
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:18.120]  Yeah. Because of, uh...
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.620]  Because it's a video game?
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:21.200]  And that's just sort of what you could assume.
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:25.120]  Yeah, but it's X as A.
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:25.620]  You're right.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:26.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:28.620]  It's X and the A position.
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:29.100]  Oh, what the?
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:30.900]  I think I'm dead.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:31.220]  Whatever.
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:34.100]  Alright, here we go. Let's go, boys. Let's do this.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.440]  Gavin's comeback begins right here.
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:37.020]  Here we go.
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.340]  Oh, I see. So we have lives.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.560]  I like this system.
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:41.260]  Oh.
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:42.980]  We're just rubbing heads.
[02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:44.560]  Oh, I should have done that to you, Gavin.
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.300]  That really hurt, dude.
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:47.300]  That really...
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:48.120]  Ah!
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:49.980]  It's gonna hurt even more when you die right here.
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:50.620]  Uh-oh.
[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:52.660]  Bunch it up.
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:54.120]  Geoff, you beast!
[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:55.560]  There goes Mario.
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:57.580]  What's up here? I can't see.
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:05:58.940]  Oh!
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:05:59.620]  Oh!
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:01.380]  There goes Mario.
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:02.120]  No!
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:03.180]  There goes Bill Kong.
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.080]  The mole lives, Geoff. It's on you.
[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:07.260]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:07.760]  Come on, man.
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:09.520]  Lock it in, Geoff. Lock it in.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:11.120]  Oh, Geoff!
[02:06:11.540 --> 02:06:11.740]  Oh!
[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:13.780]  Oh!
[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:16.240]  You're talking to a man who's been...
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:19.540]  Nothing but four days playing this fucking game to unlock those levels.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:21.380]  I'm familiar with this.
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:25.520]  Uh-oh.
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:26.980]  Fuck there, though.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.220]  Still won.
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:29.680]  Woo!
[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:31.880]  Oh, yeah, that was just flexing?
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.240]  That was for shits and giggles.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:33.840]  Oh.
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:37.260]  Wow.
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:38.300]  Interesting turn.
[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:38.980]  What a turn.
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:40.240]  15.
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:41.160]  Interesting turn.
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:42.080]  We've officially crossed the halfway.
[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:43.460]  Wow!
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:44.980]  This is the halfway point.
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:47.500]  Let's see where we stand.
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:48.100]  Okay.
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:52.040]  So halfway through the game, we hit fourth place.
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:52.840]  I didn't see.
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:54.460]  Who is in fourth place?
[02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:56.340]  If you're in fourth place, let us know.
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:56.960]  Gavin.
[02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:01.740]  Gavin's in...
[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:04.840]  Gavin, are you saying you're in fourth place?
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:05.140]  Yep.
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:06.880]  But he's cash rich.
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:07.880]  Look at all those coins.
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:08.980]  He's got all those items.
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:11.400]  Let's count that at the end of the game.
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:13.240]  They might.
[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:16.220]  Coming in third place, I believe we have the Mecha Nick.
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:17.040]  That's me.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.700]  Second place with Andrew with two stars, by the way.
[02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:21.940]  Yeah, I stole those, Gavin.
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:22.580]  First place is great.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:25.120]  It doesn't even matter to me, but not for long.
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:27.020]  I'm only six coins into first place.
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:27.720]  I'll lose that.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.220]  I'm trying to tie my shoes next level.
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.500]  Well, let's see.
[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:33.060]  Mole shoes.
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:38.200]  Monty Mole, you are in extreme danger if you roll anything from a one to a three.
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:39.700]  Good to know.
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:43.080]  And then DK can get a bunch of...
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:44.700]  How many times have you gone through start?
[02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:45.700]  Two?
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:46.820]  Twice.
[02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:48.240]  I'm going for my third.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:50.720]  So this will be worth 30 coins for you.
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:08:00.560]  Gavin, you could hit the little event space and end up right in front of where the star will be after I buy one next time.
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:04.860]  What a stage to be presented.
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:06.700]  What are we doing tomorrow?
[02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:11.560]  Terrible choice of words, but I was committed and I didn't know how to put it out of them.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:13.140]  Talk to you tomorrow.
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:14.400]  All right, bye.
[02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:15.480]  Strike by the goings good.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:18.420]  Before we started, Geoff said day 30 is a long way away.
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:21.380]  What's today?
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:23.500]  Day 16!
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:26.440]  Doing this makes a month feel real long.
[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:28.940]  Yeah, it certainly does.
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:30.760]  We have to plan all around it.
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:33.440]  Your mornings is just this thing for 10 minutes.
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:39.900]  Yeah, if you ever wanted to slow down time and say like, maybe you've got 30 days to live and you wanted to make it feel like three years.
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:44.340]  Give Mario Party one turn a shot.
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:47.500]  I mean, the old ones have 50 turns.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:49.900]  Oh, today is the day for Nick, huh?
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:52.220]  You know what? I'm just gonna guarantee a star here.
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:53.400]  That's the way to do it.
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:55.540]  Just gonna guarantee it.
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:56.060]  Great guarantee.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:59.080]  Yeah, that was a good move by you.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:01.960]  Nick, you deserve this star, buddy.
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:05.260]  Well, that could have gone poorly.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:07.340]  Nick takes first, the real threat in this game.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:13.520]  Well, I mean, not if you're counting it by coins. He's not even close.
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:16.500]  Well, if coins alone could win it.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:17.800]  Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:18.440]  That'd be real sweet.
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:20.820]  You know, it's like perspective, isn't it?
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:21.500]  Yeah.
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:23.940]  The wrong perspective.
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:27.960]  Ooh!
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:29.660]  He might get a back.
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:33.340]  That's a bad one.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:34.340]  The half of the coins?
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:38.260]  Oh, I hope Gavin lands on a half coin steel trap.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:40.160]  Andrew, what the hell, man?
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:41.640]  Yeah, you know.
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:44.160]  What are you talking about?
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:45.720]  I like it.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:50.340]  Gotta get dramatic, spicy. Dramatic, spicy twists.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:55.280]  Use the coins ones. Get that money back up.
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:56.440]  Coins ones?
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:59.960]  Get that money back up at 130 coins.
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't want to dip below, like, 120. You never know.
[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:07.480]  I'm gonna go pipe. Am I?
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:08.680]  You're just gonna pipe it?
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:09.120]  Yeah, do it.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:10.920]  Do it. Lay some pipe, Gavin.
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:11.340]  Take the pipe.
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.160]  Why wouldn't I pipe?
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:15.480]  Pipe. Go ahead. Pipe away.
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:16.500]  Is pipe bad?
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:19.080]  No, just smoke it. Let's go. Smoke the pipe.
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:20.620]  Have you been thinking about this move?
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:21.400]  Yeah.
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:23.000]  Should I not do this? Hang on.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:27.040]  It's fucking Saturday. We all get to go back to bed as soon as you're done.
[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:30.280]  Yeah, yeah. Chill out. This is more important than your Saturday, alright? Hold on.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:31.580]  I don't think it is.
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:33.140]  It's not just my Saturday. It's also Nick's.
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:36.680]  Don't you worry, Geoff. I'm gonna be quick. I thought about my move. I know what I'm doing. I'll be in and out.
[02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:40.100]  Yeah, I thought about my move. I thought I'd do a pipe, but everyone's like, why would you do the pipe?
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:41.140]  Why would you do the pipe?
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:46.300]  It's called flavor. We're adding flavor.
[02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:47.800]  I was robbed yesterday.
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:52.880]  That is true, and I feel like the way you're acting today is really hurting your case.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:58.040]  I can't believe he did that.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.880]  What a mistake. What a foolish move.
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:07.060]  I'm not after the star that's up there.
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:10.980]  He's after a vengeance star.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:13.420]  He's after a vengeance star.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:17.780]  I'm probably gonna land on those greens and maybe skip it.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:18.780]  You might have.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:25.420]  Primed. The pump is primed.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:29.200]  Dilkong, let's go.
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:34.560]  I'm gonna be quick. I thought about my move. I'm gonna use one of my mushroom tickets. Thank you.
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:35.920]  That'll give me five more.
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:41.340]  That coupon book really worked out well for you.
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:41.860]  It's great.
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:43.500]  Good value.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:47.040]  Oh, I like this roll.
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.800]  Wow, that's a good roll.
[02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:50.740]  Why didn't they call them coupons?
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:52.780]  Coupons?
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:54.060]  That's really funny.
[02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:57.060]  Is it? Coupons?
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:58.480]  Yeah, because coupons are in the game.
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:00.700]  I think it's funny. I don't know if it's really funny.
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:02.480]  Yeah, it's really funny. Hilarious.
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:03.860]  I appreciated it.
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:05.120]  Oh, he gets a boost.
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:07.520]  Shop skip.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.720]  Just a hop, skip, and a jump away.
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.500]  Springo bingo.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:17.500]  Yeah, the hydraulics on that are gonna be pretty strong to throw a monkey and a car.
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:21.340]  Dude, now you just use your quad dice, you're guaranteed.
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:22.540]  Monkey and a car.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:24.720]  Nothing could go wrong with the quad dice.
[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:25.280]  Exactly.
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:27.980]  That was funny, Gavin.
[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:30.400]  Was it really funny?
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.620]  Geoff, don't roll.
[02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:33.800]  I didn't say it was really funny.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:34.680]  See?
[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:36.840]  Goddamn, listen to my words.
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:37.560]  Good roll.
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:43.120]  Okay, now do you want money or do you want things?
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:46.460]  Do you value cash or things?
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:47.700]  I'm a things guy.
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:48.500]  Yeah, I hear that.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:52.360]  I don't think I've made a single pass of the regular finish line.
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:54.000]  I did the first time.
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:55.580]  Oh, it's the minigame.
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:57.100]  This is a Fatal 4-Way, huh boys?
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:58.440]  Maybe.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:00.000]  Fatal 4-Way.
[02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:01.740]  Fatal 4.
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.200]  Hot cross blocks.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:07.820]  Whoa, look at the mole.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:08.780]  He's got his little hands out.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:11.120]  Do I like this one?
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:12.080]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:15.760]  Wait, what are you supposed to...
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:18.280]  We all can't pick the same one, right?
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:20.400]  Yeah, but if you pick the same one as somebody else,
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:21.620]  you both don't get it.
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:22.720]  Oh, wow.
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:24.320]  So you have to guess right.
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:25.580]  Wait, what?
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:27.060]  Just hit stop.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:29.100]  Just start the game. We'll figure it out.
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:29.820]  No, I'm sorry.
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.220]  Take as much time as you need to understand.
[02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:35.900]  What do you think is holding you back right now?
[02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:36.720]  Play the pipe.
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.000]  Gavin's not sure if the platform will move
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:40.940]  once it's under the lava,
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:42.400]  so he's got to really psych it out.
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.420]  Gavin, if two of us pick the same thing,
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:46.040]  we do not advance.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:48.920]  Alright, here we go.
[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:50.240]  Did that make sense?
[02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:50.980]  Well, yeah.
[02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:52.140]  There's Mario.
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:53.560]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:55.580]  Mario understands the game.
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:57.320]  Mario's got it.
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:00.780]  I'm not going to get this.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:02.320]  Come on, Gavin.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:05.160]  What?
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:06.800]  He still doesn't get it.
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:08.100]  What don't you get?
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:09.120]  Wow.
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:10.460]  No!
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:15.460]  Does Geoff win?
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.480]  Does Nick win just by going one spot?
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:18.020]  No!
[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:18.680]  No!
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.520]  Do we cross?
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:23.920]  You have to cross the chasm.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:29.100]  Why would someone else pick that?
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.580]  Because nobody else
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:32.260]  would pick it.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.520]  Son of a bitch!
[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:36.480]  Well, no one would pick that massive thing.
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.640]  Of course they won't, dude.
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:40.580]  That one's getting taken. I shouldn't have done that.
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:42.120]  Did Wario say let's play?
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:45.040]  Oh, Dil climbing down!
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:46.820]  Maybe you should have copyrighted that.
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:49.820]  This is bad news bears.
[02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:51.020]  Yeah, I'll get my ass kicked there.
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:53.040]  No!
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:56.340]  Mario just goes for it.
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.160]  I guess I just can't use that.
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:14:59.220]  Oh, it has to connect!
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:01.600]  I didn't know it had to connect.
[02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:03.640]  That's real good news for me.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:06.740]  That really limits Nick.
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:09.180]  Oh, damn.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:10.300]  Got some pro there.
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.920]  Look at that. Dil Kong in the lead.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:14.820]  Dil set up well.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:18.000]  Oops, that's not gonna work.
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:23.120]  Gavin, why couldn't you just leave it be?
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.240]  You couldn't even have used it!
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:31.080]  He does say let's play!
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:32.580]  He does!
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.100]  Bernie's gonna fucking sue the shit out of this guy.
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:36.780]  I don't think
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:37.760]  Bernie bought that part.
[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.680]  I don't know where it extends to.
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:41.660]  I don't know what he got.
[02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:44.540]  No!
[02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:46.600]  Yes, I stopped DK.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:50.020]  It's nice to be in the middle.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:55.680]  Big choices.
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:58.520]  Gavin, wow.
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:01.820]  Me and you, Dil.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.780]  We've assured DK's win.
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:07.740]  No, not necessarily.
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:12.440]  Oh, he screwed it up!
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:13.940]  No, you moron!
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:14.940]  Why did you pick that one?
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:18.180]  I thought I could do a little jumpy jump.
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:20.120]  I'm a Dil Kong, I can jump a little bit.
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:21.200]  I'm a Dil Kong.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.240]  Anyone but him winning, I'm okay with.
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:27.040]  Why me?
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:32.140]  Gavin, don't pick the one
[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:33.280]  that you think.
[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:35.200]  You picked it, didn't you?
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:35.500]  Yep.
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:39.080]  He still has a one.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:40.600]  He still has a one.
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:42.620]  Oh, shit.
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.360]  I didn't pick that one
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:46.140]  that you're looking at, Nick.
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:49.400]  You did pick the one I was looking at.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:49.860]  Shit.
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:52.580]  You did pick the one I was looking at.
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:54.040]  Come on, Geoff, you know what you have to pick.
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:55.720]  You picked this one too, didn't you?
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:59.240]  Dil Kong has done it.
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:01.140]  It should have to be exact
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:01.900]  or it doesn't count.
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:04.140]  Freedom Kong.
[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:06.400]  He made monkey noises
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:07.240]  going up the stairs.
[02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.160]  Another win for Dil.
[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:12.160]  And the people are going to love that
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:13.480]  because Dil's the hero right now.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:14.520]  Everyone's loving Dil.
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:18.260]  Oh, everybody's loving Dil
[02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:19.380]  and his honorable moves.
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:22.060]  And upset
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:24.120]  describes the audience as well.
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:24.620]  Very upset.
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:26.540]  Are you making a Dil or a deal?
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:29.900]  I'm in fourth.
[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:31.800]  Can no one mess with me for the rest of the game?
[02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:34.040]  Okay, bad deal.
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:35.800]  No one take it. Nick, show us the board.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.040]  I'm looking at the board.
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:39.700]  Gavin is in striking distance of Boo
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:42.080]  five tiles away. He needs a six to get there
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:43.720]  though. But he has to cross the
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:45.360]  three dangerous
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:48.020]  panels. And then
[02:17:48.020 --> 02:17:49.940]  Geoff can get his items tomorrow
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:51.960]  and maybe even jump to where the star is.
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:53.500]  DK, meanwhile, primed
[02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:55.700]  to get to the star. Though he doesn't have...
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:57.200]  He'll have to do it on his own roll.
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:58.980]  His own merit. He's ten away.
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:00.700]  Exactly. Oh my god, okay.
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:03.280]  Wow, ten away? Yep.
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:05.160]  Could be a big turn on turn
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:07.160]  seventeen. Exciting to
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:09.260]  see it. Boys, we're in the back
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:11.400]  half of Mario Party. Thirty days
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:13.160]  of Mario Party. This is exciting.
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:15.260]  But come join us tomorrow and we'll see
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:17.460]  you next time. Bye. The stage has been set
[02:18:17.460 --> 02:18:19.360]  to grab the iron while it's...
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:21.060]  Hot?
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:23.180]  Grab the iron? Tune in tomorrow
[02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:24.740]  to hear the end of that statement.
[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:26.360]  This is...
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:28.880]  Grab the iron while it's hot?
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:30.740]  Everybody come
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:32.700]  back tomorrow with what the iron is.
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:34.480]  Iron gets the smell.
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:36.220]  Yeah. Hello?
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:38.620]  A watched iron gathers
[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:39.300]  no moss.
[02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:41.940]  Bye!
[02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:44.700]  Let's do it a bit, cause yesterday
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:45.800]  is... Nevermind.
[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:47.780]  Hello?
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:50.460]  New turn.
[02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:54.970]  Oh man.
[02:18:54.970 --> 02:18:56.810]  I wanted to see who was gonna
[02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:58.930]  take it. I was very curious to see.
[02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.410]  Hey Gavin, you know what would be a good bit?
[02:19:00.730 --> 02:19:02.830]  Nobody did it. When nobody
[02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:05.050]  did it, I'm like, oh my god, are we gonna do a completely
[02:19:05.050 --> 02:19:06.810]  silent episode? This is gonna be awesome.
[02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:08.890]  Double Razorback.
[02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:10.570]  Double Razorback style.
[02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:12.090]  Double Razorback.
[02:19:12.210 --> 02:19:13.590]  Double Razorback.
[02:19:14.610 --> 02:19:16.790]  This video, when it's compiled together, will make
[02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:18.710]  the least sense of anything we've ever made.
[02:19:19.350 --> 02:19:20.970]  The worst part is, we're not
[02:19:20.970 --> 02:19:22.850]  gonna remember all the
[02:19:22.850 --> 02:19:25.210]  stuff. We're not gonna remember Double Razorback.
[02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:26.030]  There's no way.
[02:19:26.710 --> 02:19:28.930]  Geoff joined the discord and Eric said the boys are
[02:19:28.930 --> 02:19:30.990]  back. Geoff got confused and said
[02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:32.410]  what's a Double Razorback?
[02:19:36.390 --> 02:19:37.710]  Now this is interesting.
[02:19:38.110 --> 02:19:40.990]  Now this is interesting.
[02:19:44.910 --> 02:19:47.070]  Now here's the thing. Do you make
[02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:48.970]  the choice, or do you leave it up to
[02:19:48.970 --> 02:19:51.090]  chance like a coward, like a
[02:19:51.090 --> 02:19:53.190]  shaky little baby who doesn't make his
[02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.470]  decision?
[02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:56.690]  I don't know.
[02:19:56.890 --> 02:19:57.670]  Here's the thing.
[02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:02.270]  None of you have wronged me.
[02:20:02.850 --> 02:20:04.670]  You could
[02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:07.190]  go back and just steal coins from Gavin.
[02:20:07.390 --> 02:20:08.590]  Now why would I do that?
[02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:10.810]  Nick, you could
[02:20:10.810 --> 02:20:13.050]  argue that Andrew harmed
[02:20:13.050 --> 02:20:14.910]  you by proxy via the deal
[02:20:14.910 --> 02:20:17.050]  he made with Gavin, which caused
[02:20:17.050 --> 02:20:18.190]  you harm.
[02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:19.130]  That's a good point.
[02:20:19.810 --> 02:20:22.110]  And he is currently carrying
[02:20:22.110 --> 02:20:24.050]  the star that was taken from me.
[02:20:24.210 --> 02:20:24.790]  That is your star.
[02:20:25.390 --> 02:20:26.790]  That's just reclamation.
[02:20:27.610 --> 02:20:29.690]  That's got your DNA on it.
[02:20:30.050 --> 02:20:31.290]  Rightful reclamation.
[02:20:31.470 --> 02:20:33.410]  But is that the man you want to
[02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:36.130]  have... his sights are gonna
[02:20:36.130 --> 02:20:36.770]  go on you.
[02:20:36.930 --> 02:20:39.930]  I guess the other thing to consider is Gavin
[02:20:39.930 --> 02:20:41.650]  is about to also go through Boo.
[02:20:42.570 --> 02:20:44.030]  So I'm gonna lose
[02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:45.090]  a star there.
[02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:47.170]  So does that mean
[02:20:47.170 --> 02:20:48.590]  Andrew would have zero stars?
[02:20:49.350 --> 02:20:51.090]  Andrew's gonna have zero stars.
[02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:53.310]  You know what?
[02:20:53.410 --> 02:20:54.150]  You convinced me.
[02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:56.170]  Rough day for the deal, but I saw Calvin.
[02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:59.190]  Now honestly, this is
[02:20:59.190 --> 02:21:00.550]  what I call a double razorback.
[02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:03.350]  Oh man, I don't like being on the receiving
[02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:04.430]  end of the double razor.
[02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:06.850]  The double razorstrop.
[02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:08.350]  Damn.
[02:21:08.850 --> 02:21:09.390]  Wow.
[02:21:11.010 --> 02:21:12.790]  That was some deliberation.
[02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:14.810]  Well, I may have not
[02:21:14.810 --> 02:21:16.630]  directly ever wrong Nick this game,
[02:21:16.770 --> 02:21:18.790]  but he certainly has wronged me.
[02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:20.610]  No, well, indirectly.
[02:21:21.330 --> 02:21:21.710]  That's what they call him.
[02:21:23.350 --> 02:21:24.150]  That's what they call me.
[02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:27.210]  Yeah, do it.
[02:21:27.450 --> 02:21:28.230]  You gotta make sure.
[02:21:28.410 --> 02:21:29.430]  One, one, two.
[02:21:33.650 --> 02:21:34.490]  It's too bad there's
[02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:36.710]  not multiplication star.
[02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:38.390]  Oh, that would be
[02:21:38.390 --> 02:21:38.830]  a good one.
[02:21:39.330 --> 02:21:40.570]  Like a times ten?
[02:21:40.570 --> 02:21:42.990]  Yeah, you just get like six times too.
[02:21:43.050 --> 02:21:43.290]  Oh man.
[02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:45.890]  It's so upsetting to have three blocks
[02:21:45.890 --> 02:21:47.970]  and have one more than a singular.
[02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:50.290]  Oh boy, we're back where we were.
[02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:53.110]  Gavin has a lot of coins.
[02:21:53.570 --> 02:21:56.490]  You want me to steal coins for myself?
[02:21:56.930 --> 02:21:58.450]  Yeah, I mean, Andrew has a lot of coins.
[02:21:58.570 --> 02:22:00.830]  I got so many coins, man.
[02:22:01.470 --> 02:22:02.210]  Now here's the thing.
[02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:04.630]  First place is three stars.
[02:22:04.810 --> 02:22:05.390]  Mighty threatening.
[02:22:06.730 --> 02:22:07.190]  Mighty.
[02:22:09.450 --> 02:22:10.110]  Mighty.
[02:22:11.530 --> 02:22:12.910]  But you know what?
[02:22:13.050 --> 02:22:14.990]  This is interesting. I have no stars.
[02:22:15.450 --> 02:22:16.970]  And there's one star for everyone else,
[02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:19.190]  which means this is really
[02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:21.070]  the perfect pick. A lovely random.
[02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:21.970]  Okay.
[02:22:22.850 --> 02:22:23.510]  Random?
[02:22:24.570 --> 02:22:24.730]  No.
[02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:26.990]  No!
[02:22:28.310 --> 02:22:28.970]  No!
[02:22:30.430 --> 02:22:31.950]  The double razor!
[02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:34.410]  Please stop talking.
[02:22:34.410 --> 02:22:36.250]  That is definitely the double razor.
[02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:38.230]  Oh!
[02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:40.510]  Oh, the razor.
[02:22:40.730 --> 02:22:41.250]  Please stop talking.
[02:22:42.470 --> 02:22:46.470]  I wish I was a robot like Eric
[02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:47.630]  so that way I wouldn't feel.
[02:22:48.130 --> 02:22:48.830]  Oh, Gavin.
[02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:51.750]  This is a situation that you've created.
[02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:54.530]  Are you noticing your human feelings
[02:22:54.530 --> 02:22:55.070]  acting up?
[02:22:56.490 --> 02:22:57.130]  Oh, man.
[02:22:57.930 --> 02:22:58.250]  Uh-oh.
[02:22:59.670 --> 02:23:00.290]  Star swap.
[02:23:00.290 --> 02:23:01.250]  Star swap.
[02:23:01.930 --> 02:23:03.550]  He just took me in a star swap.
[02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:05.390]  I don't even want to watch.
[02:23:08.290 --> 02:23:10.290]  Off to the...
[02:23:10.990 --> 02:23:12.250]  Seems like it's going faster.
[02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:13.910]  I don't really want to swap.
[02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.930]  It's speeding up.
[02:23:16.270 --> 02:23:17.670]  There's a coin and a...
[02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:19.730]  Oh, God. This is horrific. I'm going to just do it this way.
[02:23:20.530 --> 02:23:22.510]  Oh, yeah. Let's see who the players are first.
[02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:23.790]  See who the players are first.
[02:23:24.010 --> 02:23:25.230]  I don't want to be involved, really.
[02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:26.890]  Okay. I do.
[02:23:26.890 --> 02:23:27.950]  This is what I'm going to do.
[02:23:29.390 --> 02:23:30.670]  Put Dil on the board.
[02:23:31.570 --> 02:23:32.870]  Put Dil on the board.
[02:23:33.130 --> 02:23:34.450]  You're a real motherfucker.
[02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:35.070]  You know that?
[02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.470]  Whoops.
[02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:39.770]  Wait, no. Bad. Still bad.
[02:23:40.130 --> 02:23:41.430]  Bad. No.
[02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:44.190]  Okay, Nick. When shall I press it?
[02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:44.970]  Oh, Christ.
[02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:46.330]  I'm going to close my eyes. Now.
[02:23:48.130 --> 02:23:48.530]  Yes!
[02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:50.790]  Wait a minute. Hold on.
[02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.570]  No.
[02:23:51.570 --> 02:23:51.670]  No.
[02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:54.030]  Wait.
[02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:56.330]  No.
[02:23:57.450 --> 02:23:57.890]  No.
[02:23:59.870 --> 02:24:00.730]  How do you feel about that?
[02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:07.270]  Wow, Nick. You had three of them in a go.
[02:24:07.290 --> 02:24:07.690]  That was cool.
[02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:11.830]  Nick, think of all the coins you just got.
[02:24:13.050 --> 02:24:13.290]  Gavin.
[02:24:14.170 --> 02:24:14.530]  Gavin.
[02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:15.110]  Why?
[02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:17.970]  I bet you're glad you double razored.
[02:24:17.970 --> 02:24:20.350]  I pressed it when you said.
[02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.930]  You know what?
[02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:24.070]  It's all worth it because you're last, Andrew.
[02:24:24.210 --> 02:24:26.270]  That's a double backstab.
[02:24:26.470 --> 02:24:27.470]  Oh, my God.
[02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:31.450]  That was a wild turn.
[02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:33.990]  God damn it.
[02:24:34.050 --> 02:24:35.430]  I just took the lead.
[02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:38.130]  That might be the most violent turn I've ever seen.
[02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:41.190]  Oh, I'm going to kill somebody.
[02:24:41.970 --> 02:24:42.850]  Think about it like this, though.
[02:24:42.890 --> 02:24:46.030]  I gave you Andrew's star.
[02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:47.130]  Yeah.
[02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:50.170]  Which was originally Nick's star that you stole.
[02:24:50.610 --> 02:24:51.730]  No, I already did that.
[02:24:51.850 --> 02:24:52.670]  I already took that back.
[02:24:53.130 --> 02:24:56.170]  So that was just purely unadulterated yours.
[02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:58.090]  See, Nick's saying at least I'm last
[02:24:58.090 --> 02:25:00.490]  makes me feel justified about the shadow alliance earlier.
[02:25:00.670 --> 02:25:01.870]  I feel less bad.
[02:25:03.370 --> 02:25:04.810]  The shadow alliance got us both fucked.
[02:25:05.490 --> 02:25:06.210]  Ah, yeah.
[02:25:06.810 --> 02:25:07.250]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:25:07.970 --> 02:25:08.630]  That's fair.
[02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:11.230]  Geoff with the double dice.
[02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:14.250]  That's the craziest chance time I've ever seen.
[02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.690]  Give me another one.
[02:25:18.010 --> 02:25:18.890]  Digging all these.
[02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:22.050]  Refilling the coffers, as it were.
[02:25:22.770 --> 02:25:23.850]  Why couldn't it just be money?
[02:25:28.650 --> 02:25:29.890]  I miss Eric.
[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:33.370]  He can try to speak again.
[02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:36.230]  It's my roadcaster.
[02:25:36.570 --> 02:25:38.050]  It's because it's my headphones also.
[02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:39.590]  So I have to restart everything.
[02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:40.310]  Everything's fucked.
[02:25:41.550 --> 02:25:44.050]  Like this turn, everything's fucked.
[02:25:44.050 --> 02:25:45.290]  I agree, Eric.
[02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:48.170]  It's so good to have Eric back.
[02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:54.070]  I'm going to be thinking about
[02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.930]  this turn for
[02:25:55.970 --> 02:25:57.870]  my whole coffee after this.
[02:25:58.050 --> 02:25:59.310]  I bet Nick is also.
[02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.770]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:03.910]  Got that real Sunday school feeling now.
[02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:06.370]  I've got to think about the repercussions
[02:26:06.370 --> 02:26:07.250]  of what just happened.
[02:26:09.010 --> 02:26:09.470]  Yeah.
[02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:10.970]  I'm thinking about it too.
[02:26:12.570 --> 02:26:13.370]  Fucking pretty.
[02:26:13.530 --> 02:26:13.810]  Oh.
[02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:17.470]  I don't think I've ever played this one.
[02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:18.490]  It's just Indiana Jones.
[02:26:18.690 --> 02:26:19.550]  This is Crash Bandicoot.
[02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:21.110]  You've got to try and catch the ball.
[02:26:23.930 --> 02:26:24.970]  Yeah, you've got to go back
[02:26:24.970 --> 02:26:25.670]  and catch the ball.
[02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:26.510]  Yeah.
[02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:29.330]  Press up for boost.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:39.360]  Oh, I didn't know.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:40.420]  Do we have to jump over those?
[02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:40.760]  Nope.
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.520]  Can I get down off this thing, please?
[02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:45.760]  Can I get down?
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:46.980]  Oh!
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:48.800]  Oh no!
[02:26:50.060 --> 02:26:51.580]  No! No!
[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:52.080]  I got dilled!
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:55.360]  It's the W instead!
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:57.480]  I think the least you could do is let me win this, Gavin.
[02:26:59.420 --> 02:26:59.820]  Uh...
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:01.600]  I'm kind of short on cash, Nick.
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:04.340]  Are you short on cash? Yeah, but you're rich in stars.
[02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:06.520]  This is for cash.
[02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:07.740]  Yeah, okay.
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:09.920]  He needs the cash
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:10.700]  to buy more stars.
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:11.640]  Oh!
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:14.040]  Okay.
[02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:16.520]  Alright, you know what?
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:17.720]  We both did it.
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:20.360]  That was tense.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:23.680]  I'm going to put this investment towards...
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:25.140]  Did you both just get 20 coins?
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:27.560]  I would hope so.
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:29.600]  Kicking your ass. That sucks!
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:31.500]  Hell yeah!
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:33.980]  Nick, look at all your coins.
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.760]  Oh yeah, that'll sate me.
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:37.440]  He has two boot trips.
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:38.620]  That'll sate me.
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:42.100]  It won't be him,
[02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:43.600]  but we've got a bunny next turn.
[02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:49.800]  Copy items
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:51.100]  from opponents you pass?
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:52.960]  Oh, that won't matter next turn.
[02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:55.520]  Nick, what do you think you're going to do with the next 24 hours?
[02:27:56.020 --> 02:27:57.480]  Oh, I'm going to seethe.
[02:27:58.820 --> 02:27:59.620]  You're going to seethe?
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:01.920]  What happened to you?
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:02.680]  Oh right, sorry.
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:04.020]  I lost everything!
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:06.520]  Well, you're four away from the star,
[02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:08.300]  so you're about to get back in the game.
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:10.860]  After that, I assume you're going to go to Boo and have your vengeance.
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:11.780]  And then,
[02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:15.160]  looking at Geoff, Geoff has a little bit of a ways to go.
[02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:16.420]  He has the best chance of getting
[02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:18.540]  the partner who won't be Yoshi next time.
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:20.600]  Gavin has the danger of two
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:22.540]  Bowser spots, and of course can go through
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:23.700]  to get items or coins.
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:25.720]  And I'm going to catch him.
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:27.620]  I'm going to have to go for coins now.
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:30.620]  When I betrayed Gavin, I really didn't expect it to blow up
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:32.020]  in my face this quickly.
[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:34.260]  I was hoping for at least four turns.
[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:35.940]  I can't believe you have any surprise whatsoever.
[02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:38.120]  Plenty of time to mount a comeback, though.
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:40.940]  You've still got 12 turns to enact revenge.
[02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:43.060]  Anything can happen.
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.360]  Hey, Geoff, Shadow Alliance?
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:45.840]  Animal Shadow Alliance?
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:47.920]  Well, let's not talk about it in front of them.
[02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:50.140]  Oh shit, that's a long month.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.260]  That's a Sunshine Alliance.
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.820]  That's not what I'm signing up for.
[02:28:54.580 --> 02:28:56.040]  I'm a Shadow Alliance kind of guy.
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:58.640]  I support the Sunshine Alliance because I'm sick of these
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:00.700]  fuckers that are wearing hats. I don't like them.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:01.680]  Get them out of here.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:03.880]  Maybe we can discuss a Sunshine Alliance.
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:04.900]  Hat Alliance?
[02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:06.820]  Hat Alliance.
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:10.380]  You two have already betrayed each other like six times.
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:11.160]  It's a terrible alliance.
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:14.480]  The chance token was really, you know, chance.
[02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:16.800]  The only true betrayal was you betrayed me, bastard.
[02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.160]  Well, no.
[02:29:20.260 --> 02:29:22.300]  You did betray me earlier, so...
[02:29:22.300 --> 02:29:22.840]  You know what?
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:26.920]  Nick and Andrew could form a pretty strong
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:28.680]  got fucked over by Gavin on
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:30.200]  turn 18 alliance.
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:32.700]  Yeah, that would leave a G alliance ready for
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:33.440]  cooking.
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:35.420]  Well, I don't know. There's a lot of heat on you right now, man.
[02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:37.920]  I don't know that I want to sign on for that.
[02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:39.000]  But yeah, we'll talk.
[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:41.860]  Andrew, I did it for the bit.
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:44.280]  I respect it. All I know is that
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:47.020]  turn tomorrow is gonna be
[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:47.860]  ridiculous.
[02:29:48.660 --> 02:29:50.500]  Tune in for turn tomorrow.
[02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:54.380]  Triple Razorback.
[02:29:54.380 --> 02:29:55.940]  Triple Razorback.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:57.780]  Triple Razorback. Bye!
[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:00.180]  Bye-bye.
[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:02.400]  Guys, it's day 18 and there's a new
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:03.920]  homie on the board.
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:06.340]  Oh, it's Baby Bowser! Or Bowser Jr.
[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:09.360]  Lil' Baby Bowser.
[02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:12.160]  Oh my god.
[02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:12.920]  What does he do?
[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:16.360]  So he just
[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:18.100]  leaves shit all over the racetrack.
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:20.140]  Yep. Is that a bib?
[02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:21.140]  Oh, he's real close.
[02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:22.420]  Or a handkerchief.
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:24.900]  I think it's like a bib because he's like a lil' baby.
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.880]  He's a messy lil' baby.
[02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:29.880]  It's a tiny lil' messy baby.
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:32.400]  Yeah, you can call the shop.
[02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:35.400]  Out of the five of us, who do you think was the messiest baby?
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:36.820]  I think it was probably Andrew.
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:38.220]  I think it was definitely Andrew.
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:39.520]  He seems like a messy baby.
[02:30:45.370 --> 02:30:46.730]  Andrew's not confirming or denying
[02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:48.250]  which makes me think he is the messiest baby.
[02:30:48.270 --> 02:30:50.510]  You know, I haven't... I don't have a lot of
[02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:51.290]  memory stored.
[02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:54.830]  I was trying to think. Mount a defense against it.
[02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:55.970]  Not really anything I can do.
[02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:57.430]  Mount a defense.
[02:30:58.290 --> 02:31:00.490]  Oh shit, I think I might be
[02:31:00.490 --> 02:31:02.390]  fucked. Oh, did you get a double razorback?
[02:31:03.250 --> 02:31:04.270]  You got the baby Bowser.
[02:31:05.410 --> 02:31:06.730]  You got the baby Bowser!
[02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:08.110]  Yeah, but...
[02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:09.770]  You have to fight for him, I forgot.
[02:31:10.610 --> 02:31:12.990]  Are you going to land in front of us?
[02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:14.290]  Yeah, but you're going to get an advantage.
[02:31:14.650 --> 02:31:15.570]  I get an advantage.
[02:31:16.010 --> 02:31:18.310]  But why are you fucked? Are you going to land on something?
[02:31:18.310 --> 02:31:20.690]  I think I'm going to land on a Bowser space.
[02:31:21.090 --> 02:31:21.530]  Oh.
[02:31:22.130 --> 02:31:24.010]  Maybe baby Bowser will
[02:31:24.010 --> 02:31:26.230]  protect you. Maybe he'll do a communism.
[02:31:26.910 --> 02:31:28.030]  Yeah. Shit.
[02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:29.710]  A cheeky little communism.
[02:31:30.170 --> 02:31:32.350]  It's Junior's gauntlet. That would be like
[02:31:32.350 --> 02:31:34.510]  if it's Geoff's gauntlet, but it made sense.
[02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:35.470]  It's just the other way.
[02:31:36.570 --> 02:31:37.770]  What are you talking about?
[02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:39.110]  Geoff's gauntlet makes sense.
[02:31:41.210 --> 02:31:42.090]  Geoff's gauntlet.
[02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:46.130]  Oh, is this just dodge all the
[02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:47.990]  Yeah, but you can
[02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.410]  punch.
[02:31:50.890 --> 02:31:52.250]  Okay, so maybe punch
[02:31:52.250 --> 02:31:53.690]  isn't going to be a necessary thing.
[02:31:54.490 --> 02:31:55.710]  Well, it is if I marry
[02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:57.410]  the shit out of Dilkong.
[02:31:58.610 --> 02:31:59.550]  Why me?
[02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:01.350]  I have no stars.
[02:32:02.450 --> 02:32:03.890]  Mario doesn't like Dilkong
[02:32:03.890 --> 02:32:04.950]  because of the 80s.
[02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:07.250]  You know what?
[02:32:07.890 --> 02:32:08.710]  That was my dad.
[02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:11.930]  Well, the sins of the father
[02:32:11.930 --> 02:32:12.510]  and all that.
[02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:12.690]  Yeah.
[02:32:15.010 --> 02:32:16.210]  Oh, wow.
[02:32:16.390 --> 02:32:16.990]  Yay.
[02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:20.370]  I have to assume that's going to be a big
[02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:21.850]  difference maker in this thing.
[02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:24.430]  Mario, what the
[02:32:24.430 --> 02:32:25.130]  god damn.
[02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:28.070]  I got well in the middle there.
[02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.870]  Yeah.
[02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:34.330]  Don't get caught.
[02:32:34.930 --> 02:32:35.070]  You.
[02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:38.810]  You got caught because you punched me.
[02:32:40.250 --> 02:32:40.890]  Nick got
[02:32:40.890 --> 02:32:41.350]  caught.
[02:32:42.670 --> 02:32:43.970]  We are in the gap of Nick.
[02:32:44.850 --> 02:32:50.450]  What are we doing? Getting oranges?
[02:32:51.090 --> 02:32:51.250]  Yeah.
[02:32:52.410 --> 02:32:53.630]  Yeah, but there it goes.
[02:32:54.850 --> 02:32:55.410]  What?
[02:32:56.650 --> 02:32:57.670]  Did anything happen that round?
[02:32:57.890 --> 02:33:00.690]  Yeah, you guys all got points for collecting
[02:33:00.690 --> 02:33:01.150]  oranges.
[02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:03.850]  Oh, Nick and I.
[02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:05.350]  The Wario.
[02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:07.490]  Get out of here.
[02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:08.910]  Break balloons.
[02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:11.410]  Better hurry. There's points
[02:33:11.410 --> 02:33:12.010]  in them balloons.
[02:33:12.370 --> 02:33:14.370]  It was all over before I got there.
[02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:17.210]  Sausages.
[02:33:17.930 --> 02:33:19.430]  Dilkong in the lead.
[02:33:19.930 --> 02:33:21.350]  Oh, god. Hammer Bros.
[02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:22.110]  Oh, god.
[02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:24.070]  They bounce.
[02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:29.070]  Tied up first place.
[02:33:29.690 --> 02:33:30.170]  Don't get hit.
[02:33:30.650 --> 02:33:32.570]  Alright, here we go.
[02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:33.110]  I'm gonna mount it.
[02:33:34.390 --> 02:33:35.030]  Shit.
[02:33:37.470 --> 02:33:38.330]  Damn it.
[02:33:39.330 --> 02:33:39.910]  Nick with the lead.
[02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:41.950]  That was terrifying.
[02:33:42.310 --> 02:33:45.030]  Ow, you son of a...
[02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:46.370]  Oh, I fell.
[02:33:47.850 --> 02:33:50.210]  This is the worst one yet.
[02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:52.030]  This shitty game type.
[02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:54.090]  Catch the chicken. Give me it.
[02:33:55.370 --> 02:33:56.130]  Give me it.
[02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:56.450]  Nick.
[02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:59.950]  I mean, that was close.
[02:33:59.950 --> 02:34:01.530]  Real close.
[02:34:02.270 --> 02:34:02.970]  Tied up.
[02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:04.630]  Oh, wow.
[02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:06.570]  For all the marbles.
[02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:10.850]  Don't you...
[02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:11.990]  Cow.
[02:34:14.130 --> 02:34:15.030]  No, move, Geoff.
[02:34:19.970 --> 02:34:20.790]  Well...
[02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:24.770]  Oh, it's a reset.
[02:34:25.170 --> 02:34:25.950]  What?
[02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:27.010]  Oh.
[02:34:27.370 --> 02:34:28.970]  I wonder if nobody gets them.
[02:34:29.610 --> 02:34:31.610]  Or do you think it goes to advantage to me?
[02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:34.410]  Oh, my god.
[02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:35.090]  Wow.
[02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:38.190]  I've never seen this.
[02:34:41.970 --> 02:34:45.730]  Hey, guys.
[02:34:45.970 --> 02:34:47.750]  Do you think the tie goes to me?
[02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:50.090]  You know why? Because I'm the one who landed on the space.
[02:34:50.190 --> 02:34:51.770]  So I thought maybe it would just be like...
[02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:54.310]  You got three points as an advantage.
[02:34:54.310 --> 02:34:55.930]  I heard them all.
[02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:01.310]  Great.
[02:35:03.130 --> 02:35:04.170]  Oh, man.
[02:35:04.310 --> 02:35:08.430]  Where will he land?
[02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:09.210]  Oh, thank god.
[02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:11.470]  You didn't even land on the Bowser.
[02:35:11.950 --> 02:35:13.550]  You want the money or you want the things?
[02:35:14.330 --> 02:35:15.330]  Oh, it's things time.
[02:35:15.770 --> 02:35:17.490]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:35:18.090 --> 02:35:19.790]  It's gonna get a double thing, I believe.
[02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.890]  What's going on?
[02:35:21.450 --> 02:35:22.930]  It's making the space gammy.
[02:35:22.930 --> 02:35:22.990]  Okay.
[02:35:24.530 --> 02:35:25.090]  Yep.
[02:35:25.610 --> 02:35:27.090]  A gammy space for me.
[02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:29.710]  Do you get to do this twice?
[02:35:30.290 --> 02:35:31.010]  I think so.
[02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:32.290]  Nice.
[02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:37.950]  And then what?
[02:35:38.430 --> 02:35:41.210]  So that Super Dice only stops at Britney Spears movies.
[02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:42.170]  That's interesting.
[02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:47.790]  And you're in the lane to get more items?
[02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.650]  I know.
[02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:50.730]  I have to burn one to go.
[02:35:50.730 --> 02:35:51.870]  There's been a bridges.
[02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:55.030]  I'm gonna roll my Buntz dice.
[02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:56.510]  Oh, I love it.
[02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:57.870]  You gotta get that money, baby.
[02:35:59.730 --> 02:36:00.490]  Don't you touch Bowser Jr.
[02:36:00.490 --> 02:36:01.470]  Come on, 20. Let's go.
[02:36:01.870 --> 02:36:03.910]  I just wanna take some Bowser Jr.
[02:36:04.410 --> 02:36:05.430]  Roll a one and a one.
[02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:07.470]  Oh, my god.
[02:36:07.730 --> 02:36:08.550]  Oh, my god.
[02:36:11.330 --> 02:36:11.710]  Well...
[02:36:13.050 --> 02:36:13.990]  Split the difference.
[02:36:14.370 --> 02:36:16.190]  That's kind of a day for you, Gavin.
[02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:17.410]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:36:17.410 --> 02:36:18.050]  Go left.
[02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:19.170]  You need the money.
[02:36:29.410 --> 02:36:30.910]  Gavin, you're about to pass Geoff.
[02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:32.670]  You gotta fill her up.
[02:36:33.170 --> 02:36:35.570]  Which means Geoff is going to take baby Bowser when he goes.
[02:36:35.730 --> 02:36:36.190]  You can have him.
[02:36:37.890 --> 02:36:39.390]  Yeah, I think he just doesn't want you to have him.
[02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:41.990]  He's just trying to stick it to you specifically, Nick.
[02:36:43.490 --> 02:36:44.570]  That creepy face.
[02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:45.810]  Man, I don't know what his issue with you is.
[02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:47.070]  Yeah, I don't get it, man.
[02:36:49.210 --> 02:36:50.130]  Alright, nice hole.
[02:36:51.390 --> 02:36:52.050]  Nice hole?
[02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:53.530]  Hole?
[02:36:53.850 --> 02:36:55.290]  I see what his issue is with you.
[02:36:58.470 --> 02:37:00.430]  Oh, double the bad luck.
[02:37:01.230 --> 02:37:02.570]  I never should have taken this shmuckin'.
[02:37:02.570 --> 02:37:04.270]  Oh, wait, do you get this thing twice, then?
[02:37:04.570 --> 02:37:04.970]  Yeah.
[02:37:05.410 --> 02:37:06.170]  Oh, my god.
[02:37:07.310 --> 02:37:10.830]  Well, at least you can make really shit space now.
[02:37:13.410 --> 02:37:13.810]  Ooh.
[02:37:14.530 --> 02:37:15.830]  Get five for the last place.
[02:37:16.330 --> 02:37:17.310]  Oh, man.
[02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:19.630]  Alright, what's the second one now?
[02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:20.330]  Could've been way worse.
[02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:22.510]  It's about to be way worse.
[02:37:23.070 --> 02:37:25.750]  Get five for the last place.
[02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:27.230]  Oh, man.
[02:37:27.450 --> 02:37:27.930]  Oh, my god.
[02:37:31.210 --> 02:37:31.810]  That's it?
[02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.710]  I got an achievement.
[02:37:33.430 --> 02:37:34.790]  Your turn, not your turn.
[02:37:34.890 --> 02:37:37.770]  Well, I am four away from the star, but before I even do that,
[02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:39.930]  I need some of those
[02:37:39.930 --> 02:37:41.610]  fucking coins, Nick.
[02:37:41.650 --> 02:37:42.610]  Let's get in here.
[02:37:42.850 --> 02:37:45.830]  This is an interesting turn.
[02:37:46.350 --> 02:37:47.750]  Nick, don't give them to them because
[02:37:48.250 --> 02:37:50.890]  he's gonna go through Boo for a double star thing.
[02:37:50.970 --> 02:37:51.870]  I know what he's...
[02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:52.670]  Yeah, I know.
[02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:55.110]  Nick doesn't need your explanations.
[02:37:55.770 --> 02:37:57.710]  Oh, I get to choose?
[02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:01.510]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[02:38:03.630 --> 02:38:04.930]  All or nothing, baby.
[02:38:05.170 --> 02:38:05.930]  Oh, my god.
[02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:09.170]  You're gonna make Nick a billionaire.
[02:38:09.490 --> 02:38:10.070]  Let's make this interesting.
[02:38:12.170 --> 02:38:13.050]  This is crazy.
[02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:13.710]  Nick, how are you feeling?
[02:38:14.170 --> 02:38:15.750]  We dueling this morning.
[02:38:15.850 --> 02:38:16.590]  I'll tell you in a second.
[02:38:16.590 --> 02:38:17.410]  It's a dill duel.
[02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:20.570]  This is a great one.
[02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:22.570]  Oh, yeah, this one's just immense.
[02:38:25.450 --> 02:38:26.110]  Let's do it.
[02:38:26.130 --> 02:38:27.090]  He's got that jerk confidence.
[02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:28.490]  It's not jerk.
[02:38:28.890 --> 02:38:30.230]  Oh, you're just doing up and down?
[02:38:30.490 --> 02:38:32.130]  I think my money's on Andrew, you know?
[02:38:33.170 --> 02:38:33.730]  Never mind.
[02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:35.330]  I put money on Nick.
[02:38:40.850 --> 02:38:42.810]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[02:38:42.850 --> 02:38:44.210]  Dill, dill, dill, dill.
[02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:46.290]  There you go.
[02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:47.390]  Oh, Nick.
[02:38:48.470 --> 02:38:49.190]  Oh, Nick.
[02:38:49.370 --> 02:38:50.170]  He's gonna get you.
[02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:52.470]  I don't know what you both are doing.
[02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:54.230]  You can stop. You can wait.
[02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.590]  No need.
[02:38:56.210 --> 02:38:56.810]  No need.
[02:38:58.170 --> 02:38:59.050]  No need.
[02:38:59.390 --> 02:39:00.370]  Oh, my God.
[02:39:04.690 --> 02:39:05.570]  Nick won.
[02:39:07.350 --> 02:39:08.990]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:11.530]  That really backfired on you, Andrew.
[02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:12.350]  Unbelievable.
[02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:14.970]  Well, well, well.
[02:39:15.010 --> 02:39:17.050]  If it isn't comeuppance.
[02:39:19.570 --> 02:39:21.690]  Comeuppance, you stole everything from me.
[02:39:21.810 --> 02:39:23.090]  And now I've stolen the rest.
[02:39:23.690 --> 02:39:25.150]  Yeah, I mean, I think you handed him these.
[02:39:25.150 --> 02:39:26.350]  I think you gave him that stuff.
[02:39:26.390 --> 02:39:27.270]  Yeah, this one's all you, bud.
[02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:29.470]  Oh, my God.
[02:39:29.490 --> 02:39:31.950]  You just kept slamming into the things.
[02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:34.790]  You have won.
[02:39:35.230 --> 02:39:35.650]  You have won.
[02:39:35.650 --> 02:39:38.090]  Did you think that at this point in today's gameplay,
[02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:40.050]  things would get so much better for you, Nick?
[02:39:40.970 --> 02:39:42.070]  You know what? No.
[02:39:42.290 --> 02:39:44.730]  I really fought the star, though.
[02:39:44.890 --> 02:39:46.330]  Oh, he can't even get to the star.
[02:39:46.470 --> 02:39:46.850]  No.
[02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:49.810]  He didn't make it to the star.
[02:39:55.150 --> 02:39:56.710]  You didn't even leave yourself 20.
[02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:58.310]  Oh, my God.
[02:39:59.590 --> 02:40:00.650]  This is crazy.
[02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:02.770]  Andrew, what was that?
[02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:06.570]  You stole everything from me.
[02:40:06.910 --> 02:40:09.210]  It's like he was mugged on the street
[02:40:09.210 --> 02:40:11.030]  and then he went out to find the mugger and tell him
[02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:12.750]  here's the rest of the cash from my apartment.
[02:40:13.250 --> 02:40:15.110]  I had stuff in my right pocket, too.
[02:40:15.270 --> 02:40:17.210]  You forgot about my other pocket.
[02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:19.710]  I actually just went to the ATM.
[02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:20.750]  Hang on. Come back.
[02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:22.670]  Wait, wait, wait. Here are my car keys.
[02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:24.510]  Ooh.
[02:40:24.990 --> 02:40:27.050]  Oh, God.
[02:40:27.430 --> 02:40:28.550]  What a day.
[02:40:28.810 --> 02:40:31.050]  This is a very interesting turn.
[02:40:31.470 --> 02:40:33.370]  Andrew's going to have to lay down after this.
[02:40:33.650 --> 02:40:35.110]  With all the stuff... Oh, it's all against me.
[02:40:35.210 --> 02:40:36.530]  With all the stuff flipped around...
[02:40:36.530 --> 02:40:38.110]  Yeah, because it's fucking 7 a.m.
[02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:39.810]  I will anyway.
[02:40:40.330 --> 02:40:43.210]  If the jump pads are flipped, does that mean you can do boo and then jump back?
[02:40:45.330 --> 02:40:45.590]  Huh?
[02:40:45.890 --> 02:40:46.270]  What?
[02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:50.050]  What?
[02:40:50.050 --> 02:40:51.690]  What the hell did you say?
[02:40:52.310 --> 02:40:54.050]  Like the space...
[02:40:54.890 --> 02:40:57.030]  The jump over the store and the boo space.
[02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:58.590]  They're flipped right now, aren't they?
[02:40:59.210 --> 02:41:00.510]  Yeah, just for this turn, though.
[02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:04.550]  Does that mean if you hit boo, you could jump back to boo?
[02:41:05.290 --> 02:41:07.330]  If you did it this previous turn.
[02:41:07.650 --> 02:41:08.050]  I think...
[02:41:08.650 --> 02:41:10.390]  Oh, I was wondering if Andrew was going to play.
[02:41:10.690 --> 02:41:11.870]  That was really...
[02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.990]  I'm playing.
[02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:14.410]  That's what I thought.
[02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:17.770]  Punch him, Geoff.
[02:41:19.410 --> 02:41:20.050]  Damn it.
[02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:23.110]  Oh, you shouldn't have tried to punch him.
[02:41:23.470 --> 02:41:24.850]  Yeah, you shouldn't have tried. You shouldn't have done that.
[02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:27.150]  I'm like a bowling ball that a two-year-old threw.
[02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:29.210]  To be honest with you, I feel a little bad for Andrew right now.
[02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:30.430]  Oh, shit.
[02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:32.750]  Don't feel so bad. He's going to beat Gavin at this.
[02:41:33.410 --> 02:41:34.370]  That's true. Come on.
[02:41:35.050 --> 02:41:36.970]  I don't feel bad. He challenged me for all my money.
[02:41:37.490 --> 02:41:37.810]  No kidding.
[02:41:37.810 --> 02:41:39.370]  The recovery starts right here, Andrew.
[02:41:39.470 --> 02:41:41.550]  Not for all your money, for all my money.
[02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:43.290]  For half of your money.
[02:41:43.570 --> 02:41:46.310]  He did it to himself. It was really impressive.
[02:41:46.310 --> 02:41:48.050]  I had to.
[02:41:48.690 --> 02:41:52.350]  You could have bet like 40 and still bought a star.
[02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:53.270]  Damn it.
[02:41:53.430 --> 02:41:54.310]  Neither of you moved.
[02:41:54.730 --> 02:41:55.810]  Neither of you did move.
[02:41:55.810 --> 02:41:57.070]  No, I did a little psych move.
[02:41:59.230 --> 02:42:00.150]  Gavin frozen.
[02:42:01.370 --> 02:42:02.410]  Wow, what a turn.
[02:42:02.930 --> 02:42:05.210]  Big Wario win. How many coins did Donkey Kong get off that one?
[02:42:05.810 --> 02:42:05.950]  None.
[02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:07.390]  Oh, interesting.
[02:42:09.690 --> 02:42:11.500]  Zero stars, four coins.
[02:42:12.530 --> 02:42:13.190]  Oh, my God.
[02:42:13.230 --> 02:42:14.170]  We're on like turn 18.
[02:42:14.170 --> 02:42:16.650]  I was there once upon a time.
[02:42:16.690 --> 02:42:18.470]  It gets easier eventually.
[02:42:18.590 --> 02:42:21.050]  That was a crazy boarding.
[02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:24.210]  Andrew, it's like you haven't even been playing.
[02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:26.910]  I hurt so much.
[02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:30.850]  Unflip.
[02:42:31.390 --> 02:42:33.790]  Let's take a look at the board.
[02:42:34.810 --> 02:42:36.830]  Four turn whatever tomorrow is.
[02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:38.630]  Alright.
[02:42:39.030 --> 02:42:41.830]  Well, DK, two away from the star.
[02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:45.150]  Oh.
[02:42:49.890 --> 02:42:52.710]  I love how different the vibe is day to day.
[02:42:54.530 --> 02:42:56.510]  Geoff is 15 to get to the star.
[02:42:56.590 --> 02:42:57.270]  He's got doubled eyes.
[02:42:57.410 --> 02:43:00.310]  He could really make a play and catch up to Gavin here.
[02:43:00.450 --> 02:43:02.830]  Gavin, you, let's see.
[02:43:03.450 --> 02:43:04.490]  You got some stuff coming up.
[02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:06.010]  Me, right behind you.
[02:43:06.190 --> 02:43:07.250]  I'm going to get that Bowser Jr.
[02:43:08.470 --> 02:43:08.950]  You better.
[02:43:09.770 --> 02:43:10.250]  Okay.
[02:43:11.610 --> 02:43:12.590]  There you have it.
[02:43:12.690 --> 02:43:13.790]  Going into turn 19.
[02:43:13.970 --> 02:43:14.890]  Going into day 19.
[02:43:15.190 --> 02:43:17.930]  We are so close to day 20, which means we're getting on to day 30.
[02:43:18.090 --> 02:43:19.010]  I'm really excited.
[02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:20.750]  Can Andrew mount a comeback?
[02:43:22.090 --> 02:43:24.290]  How defeated is Andrew right now?
[02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:31.810]  Did you think losing the duel was even an option?
[02:43:32.050 --> 02:43:33.950]  Why did you lose the duel?
[02:43:35.850 --> 02:43:37.550]  I would have done that if I were you.
[02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:38.790]  Yeah, that was a bad idea.
[02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:42.790]  A guy like me would have won that.
[02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:44.570]  I would have endeavored to have won that one.
[02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:47.190]  Well, find out what happens...
[02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:49.350]  Oh, he definitely endeavored.
[02:43:50.170 --> 02:43:51.450]  Nick, are you sated now?
[02:43:52.010 --> 02:43:52.410]  Am I what?
[02:43:53.850 --> 02:43:54.430]  What did you say?
[02:43:55.090 --> 02:43:56.290]  Somebody let Eric say goodbye.
[02:43:56.370 --> 02:43:57.990]  I'm trying to end this fucking thing.
[02:43:58.330 --> 02:44:00.770]  We have so many days that we have to get through.
[02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:03.250]  Find out what happens to Andrew and everyone else
[02:44:03.250 --> 02:44:05.430]  as we get into day 19 tomorrow.
[02:44:05.430 --> 02:44:06.990]  Thanks for joining us. Bye!
[02:44:07.530 --> 02:44:09.050]  We'll endeavor to see you there.
[02:44:12.290 --> 02:44:13.190]  Guess what?
[02:44:14.170 --> 02:44:15.670]  We're still doing it.
[02:44:15.970 --> 02:44:18.790]  We are still doing it.
[02:44:18.810 --> 02:44:19.830]  Day 19.
[02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:21.510]  I said to Andrew this morning
[02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:23.230]  that I think this is the
[02:44:23.230 --> 02:44:25.110]  return of Dilkong to his form.
[02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:27.150]  It's going to reset Dil.
[02:44:27.230 --> 02:44:28.970]  We're getting a new, stronger Dil.
[02:44:29.250 --> 02:44:31.650]  It was a rough day for Dil and the Dillionaires out there.
[02:44:32.050 --> 02:44:33.550]  But we'll bounce back.
[02:44:35.050 --> 02:44:35.690]  The Dillionaires?
[02:44:35.930 --> 02:44:37.710]  The Dillionaires, all the fans, all the Dils,
[02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:39.990]  all the Dilheads out there, the Dillionaires, me and the Dillionaires.
[02:44:40.690 --> 02:44:41.010]  Dilheads.
[02:44:42.930 --> 02:44:43.250]  Dillionaires.
[02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:45.130]  I think this is the move right here, Nick.
[02:44:45.550 --> 02:44:46.810]  I think this is the move.
[02:44:47.550 --> 02:44:49.450]  You just want to aim for medium numbers.
[02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:50.710]  This is good. That's good. That's good.
[02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:52.630]  You're not pissing about. You just roll it.
[02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:53.190]  This is good.
[02:44:54.090 --> 02:44:57.750]  25. Dude, that's going to put you right there.
[02:44:58.410 --> 02:44:59.390]  Oh no, I didn't take...
[02:44:59.390 --> 02:44:59.930]  What's his name?
[02:44:59.930 --> 02:45:00.570]  No!
[02:45:01.250 --> 02:45:02.710]  Wow, you didn't snatch?
[02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:04.830]  No, it doesn't stop for anything.
[02:45:04.890 --> 02:45:06.970]  Well, you did get a clover though. That's pretty good.
[02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:07.930]  Excellent.
[02:45:12.190 --> 02:45:15.310]  I didn't think I'd ever see anyone have so much money in this game.
[02:45:16.050 --> 02:45:17.690]  Well, he took it all from Andrew
[02:45:17.690 --> 02:45:19.110]  because Andrew just handed it to him.
[02:45:20.190 --> 02:45:21.430]  Handed is a strong word.
[02:45:21.810 --> 02:45:23.790]  Lost competition. That was close.
[02:45:24.490 --> 02:45:25.330]  Narrowly lost.
[02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:27.090]  We should keep our eye on Nick.
[02:45:27.090 --> 02:45:29.650]  If he gets much richer, he might try to take over our government.
[02:45:29.890 --> 02:45:30.870]  Oh no.
[02:45:31.250 --> 02:45:31.690]  No.
[02:45:32.930 --> 02:45:33.230]  No.
[02:45:35.310 --> 02:45:37.390]  Suddenly, Nick is our shadow president.
[02:45:38.290 --> 02:45:38.850]  What do you mean?
[02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:39.630]  You like my car?
[02:45:40.350 --> 02:45:43.390]  He's carrying his kid around so no one comes after him.
[02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:45.210]  It's like, oh man, what a plan.
[02:45:45.310 --> 02:45:45.610]  I'm a father.
[02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:46.410]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:50.370]  I do think you should introduce the actual Mario Party into the political system.
[02:45:50.450 --> 02:45:51.110]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:45:52.810 --> 02:45:54.830]  I was looking at the map, Eric.
[02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:56.570]  Oh, okay.
[02:45:57.130 --> 02:45:57.530]  Cool.
[02:45:58.930 --> 02:45:59.330]  Boring.
[02:46:01.170 --> 02:46:01.970]  Double dice.
[02:46:05.410 --> 02:46:07.650]  What's your game plan?
[02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:10.630]  My game plan was, Nick,
[02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:12.690]  to throw a curse dice on you
[02:46:12.690 --> 02:46:15.230]  so you couldn't reach the star, but I've noticed you have a double dice.
[02:46:15.650 --> 02:46:17.370]  Yeah, so I can just undo your curse dice.
[02:46:19.230 --> 02:46:19.630]  Ooh.
[02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:20.730]  12.
[02:46:20.730 --> 02:46:21.530]  Ooh.
[02:46:22.170 --> 02:46:23.770]  Where are you gonna end up?
[02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:25.230]  Ooh, a shop.
[02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:28.250]  Sell me a golden pipe.
[02:46:30.010 --> 02:46:30.530]  Oh.
[02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:31.730]  They updated their inventory?
[02:46:32.310 --> 02:46:35.290]  I do like that this one doesn't just have golden pipes.
[02:46:35.370 --> 02:46:36.750]  Wait, what's the last thing there?
[02:46:36.770 --> 02:46:38.230]  Those are star steels, I think.
[02:46:38.490 --> 02:46:39.290]  Holy shit.
[02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:41.670]  For 10?
[02:46:42.350 --> 02:46:44.270]  Gavin, you know what you have to do.
[02:46:44.310 --> 02:46:45.270]  Oh, mushroom. Okay.
[02:46:45.770 --> 02:46:48.570]  I mean, star steel's crazy because there's one space
[02:46:48.570 --> 02:46:50.430]  we keep landing on no matter what.
[02:46:50.770 --> 02:46:51.630]  Is it two?
[02:46:51.810 --> 02:46:53.270]  Yeah, he's getting two because he's got a partner.
[02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:55.490]  Oh, okay.
[02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:58.330]  I thought he gave you two opportunities in the shop, though.
[02:46:58.410 --> 02:46:59.150]  Oh, man.
[02:46:59.910 --> 02:47:02.050]  You putting down a star steel is like in a movie
[02:47:02.050 --> 02:47:03.950]  when they show a nail that's upwards,
[02:47:04.170 --> 02:47:05.990]  just on the floor, and you know
[02:47:06.890 --> 02:47:08.290]  someone's stepping on it eventually.
[02:47:09.730 --> 02:47:10.610]  Constant tension.
[02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:12.130]  Have you ever stepped on a nail?
[02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:13.010]  Yes.
[02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.430]  Terrible.
[02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:17.610]  Stitches and a tetanus shot.
[02:47:17.770 --> 02:47:18.030]  Yep.
[02:47:20.670 --> 02:47:21.570]  Oh, this is
[02:47:21.570 --> 02:47:23.630]  gonna get real interesting real fast.
[02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:25.810]  You could also do
[02:47:25.810 --> 02:47:27.270]  crazy dice, but I think you're good.
[02:47:27.450 --> 02:47:28.270]  I think you got it.
[02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:30.510]  What's better, a custom or a movie?
[02:47:30.510 --> 02:47:33.170]  I wish you could put it down now because the funniest thing would be me
[02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:34.330]  somehow landing on it.
[02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:39.090]  Alright, I'm gonna call it a day with that.
[02:47:39.530 --> 02:47:39.830]  Okay.
[02:47:40.330 --> 02:47:42.770]  What do you think happens if they land on it and they don't have a star?
[02:47:43.290 --> 02:47:44.070]  Probably just like
[02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:46.810]  makes fun of them, like throws them
[02:47:46.810 --> 02:47:47.930]  down in the dirt, makes them eat mud.
[02:47:48.810 --> 02:47:50.710]  For real? We're in turn 19.
[02:47:50.890 --> 02:47:51.910]  You don't have... seriously?
[02:47:52.930 --> 02:47:53.690]  Oh man.
[02:47:54.650 --> 02:47:56.550]  Hey buddy, we're almost done with this game.
[02:47:56.610 --> 02:47:57.130]  You know that, right?
[02:47:58.570 --> 02:47:59.830]  Now would be the time.
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:04.740]  I'm curious where
[02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:06.000]  Gavin's gonna place these two.
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:08.300]  Get curious, son.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:09.600]  Maybe right on Boo.
[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:12.920]  Oh, now he's gonna get right in front of Clover.
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:14.920]  Oh, what if he puts them right by the...
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:16.400]  What the...
[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:18.400]  Alright, let's see what you get.
[02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:21.560]  If I land on one of those half spots, I am screwed.
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:22.780]  Oh, it's a creepy dice block. That's fun.
[02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:24.820]  Cool. Here's more
[02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:25.200]  bullshit.
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:29.020]  Let me just go ahead and pop this right on the
[02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:29.380]  floor.
[02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:32.120]  Throw it into the tree.
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:33.760]  Here comes the second one.
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:36.080]  Here comes another one.
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:37.080]  Oh my god.
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:39.900]  Try to get money this time.
[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:40.520]  Yes!
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:44.020]  Let me just go ahead and...
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:46.040]  It's just
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:47.960]  the same one. They picked it
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:50.100]  back up and they're like, oh, we think you dropped this.
[02:48:50.380 --> 02:48:51.660]  I don't think I've ever thrown away
[02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:54.100]  three creepy dice on the same turn before
[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:54.720]  but that was it.
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:57.700]  Alright, Dilkong's return to form.
[02:48:58.300 --> 02:48:59.720]  Alright, make your Diltards proud.
[02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:01.720]  Um, the Dillionaires
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:03.840]  are gonna have a great turn. We're just gonna go
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:04.460]  on a little drive.
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:08.080]  I mean, you might as well because you can't get the star
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:09.760]  I can't do anything here.
[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:11.620]  Get up, okay.
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:12.440]  Three, not great.
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:13.720]  Three, not great.
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:15.540]  Three, not great.
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:19.160]  Okay, well, I'm fucking done.
[02:49:20.060 --> 02:49:22.560]  Wait, you got 30 coins for that?
[02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:23.460]  Oh, wait.
[02:49:25.060 --> 02:49:25.860]  Is that good?
[02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:28.180]  Yes, and you got all 30 coins.
[02:49:28.740 --> 02:49:30.040]  No, no, he's blowing by it.
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.140]  Oh, but he can go to Boo
[02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:33.760]  and get more stuff on the next turn.
[02:49:34.060 --> 02:49:36.400]  If he can get that 50, I have enough for a star.
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:37.920]  Damn, dude.
[02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:40.460]  Alright, let's see if I can make the
[02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:42.040]  Mole Men proud. Okay.
[02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:44.360]  That's what my
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:45.920]  group is called. Oh, the Mole Men?
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:47.780]  Yeah, it's a whole thing.
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:49.760]  Oh, God, I may have overplayed my hand here.
[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:52.160]  I'm gonna go ahead and hit bump.
[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:53.140]  Oh, god.
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:55.200]  Hey, Nick, you're okay.
[02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:56.860]  Nick, you're fine.
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:49:59.260]  Nick, don't worry about it.
[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:01.720]  Hey!
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:03.380]  19, damn it.
[02:50:03.380 --> 02:50:04.820]  Oh, you're gonna get a thingy.
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:07.440]  What's his name? Oh, you're gonna steal that.
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:08.420]  You're gonna steal a little kid.
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:10.080]  Baby Bowser.
[02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:13.140]  Oh, god, the track's gonna be lit.
[02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:13.860]  Oh, god in heaven.
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:17.460]  Oh, this is gonna
[02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:18.280]  be unfortunate.
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:21.360]  Are you gonna go... which lane
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:22.240]  are you gonna head to, Geoff?
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:25.460]  Oh, jeez, who knows. I'll figure it out in the moment.
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:26.960]  Okay.
[02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:29.680]  That moment is about to be...
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:31.320]  I think the moment's right now.
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:34.600]  You're probably gonna go this way.
[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:36.700]  Okay.
[02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:38.720]  Oh, my god. Why?
[02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:41.460]  Why would you do that?
[02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:43.380]  But you won't get the
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:45.400]  star now. I'm 59 away from
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:46.160]  the star the other way.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:49.440]  No, but Nick's gonna get the star and it'll be
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:50.400]  on the other path.
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:53.420]  We'll see. We'll see. We'll have to roll some dice.
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:50:54.960]  He's got two dice.
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:57.580]  The future is unwritten.
[02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:01.320]  I believe Natasha Bedingfield said that.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:03.260]  It's true. Feel the rain on your skin.
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:08.880]  Oh, okay.
[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:11.300]  A lot of garbage getting
[02:51:11.300 --> 02:51:12.820]  tossed on the floor in this turn.
[02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:15.060]  That's not a bad one.
[02:51:15.100 --> 02:51:16.240]  Custom block's pretty great.
[02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:18.200]  Yeah, that's pretty helpful, honestly.
[02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:20.000]  Alright, it's fight night.
[02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:25.180]  Oh, free for all.
[02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:25.980]  Can we do double?
[02:51:26.660 --> 02:51:28.020]  Oh, coin. Have it be the coin one.
[02:51:29.580 --> 02:51:30.860]  Oh, this is like the
[02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:32.620]  moon quiz, but it's the big top quiz, Gavin.
[02:51:33.040 --> 02:51:34.200]  Moon quiz started last night.
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:36.780]  How's it going?
[02:51:37.060 --> 02:51:38.060]  It's tied 0-0.
[02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:40.340]  God, I absolutely hate this game.
[02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:41.940]  Yeah, this one's tough.
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:44.880]  Me and my wife know less about the moon than I think
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:45.280]  we thought.
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:50.900]  Alright, let's watch these
[02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:52.660]  losers. I'm so
[02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:53.320]  unobservant.
[02:51:56.840 --> 02:51:58.580]  Isn't fishbone like a band, Geoff?
[02:51:58.580 --> 02:51:59.760]  Yeah, it is.
[02:51:59.900 --> 02:52:00.240]  Oh!
[02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:08.990]  Where the hell am I? God, I'm forever
[02:52:08.990 --> 02:52:09.510]  away!
[02:52:11.790 --> 02:52:12.550]  Way to go, Nick.
[02:52:14.210 --> 02:52:15.030]  Way to go, Nick.
[02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:16.510]  One point. Way to go, man.
[02:52:16.570 --> 02:52:18.090]  Good work, dude.
[02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:20.210]  Here we go.
[02:52:21.970 --> 02:52:23.490]  What do we got?
[02:52:25.450 --> 02:52:25.950]  I'm looking.
[02:52:26.650 --> 02:52:28.190]  Let's see. That's that thing.
[02:52:28.510 --> 02:52:29.270]  And that thing.
[02:52:30.490 --> 02:52:31.650]  And that thing.
[02:52:33.490 --> 02:52:34.470]  What the fuck?
[02:52:34.930 --> 02:52:36.710]  Interesting pose that Yoshi has there.
[02:52:36.810 --> 02:52:37.690]  I don't like that.
[02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:40.350]  Ooh!
[02:52:41.070 --> 02:52:41.330]  Oh!
[02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:42.930]  How did I float up there?
[02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:45.830]  Don't worry, you're not Geoff.
[02:52:46.010 --> 02:52:46.450]  What the fuck up there?
[02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:49.430]  Just hanging out in the sky.
[02:52:50.810 --> 02:52:52.110]  What a comeback.
[02:52:52.690 --> 02:52:54.270]  Dill Kong's still in first here.
[02:52:54.450 --> 02:52:55.370]  Day of the Dill.
[02:52:57.010 --> 02:52:58.030]  There we go.
[02:52:58.030 --> 02:53:00.130]  Last one. Come on.
[02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:11.430]  Okay, don't mess this one up.
[02:53:11.890 --> 02:53:12.530]  Okay.
[02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:17.670]  Ooh!
[02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:20.370]  Uh-oh.
[02:53:21.450 --> 02:53:22.350]  Wario doesn't know.
[02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:24.410]  Wario. Wario.
[02:53:25.390 --> 02:53:26.150]  Time to make a pick.
[02:53:27.850 --> 02:53:28.410]  Yeah!
[02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.910]  Ooh!
[02:53:30.130 --> 02:53:31.690]  Day of the Dill continues.
[02:53:31.850 --> 02:53:33.230]  Day of the Dill.
[02:53:34.250 --> 02:53:35.790]  Oh, sweet. Gavin got fourth.
[02:53:42.350 --> 02:53:42.870]  Oh.
[02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:44.010]  Oh, that was a needed...
[02:53:44.010 --> 02:53:45.810]  needed win for Dill Kong.
[02:53:46.230 --> 02:53:47.550]  Man, I don't...
[02:53:47.550 --> 02:53:49.810]  How did you get three...
[02:53:49.810 --> 02:53:51.910]  or four threes to get 30 coins?
[02:53:52.010 --> 02:53:52.790]  Insane. Crazy.
[02:53:53.350 --> 02:53:55.770]  Look at this, Andrew. Look how many coins you got compared to yesterday.
[02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.690]  All of a sudden.
[02:53:57.830 --> 02:53:59.790]  About, let's see...
[02:54:00.490 --> 02:54:02.390]  18 less than I had yesterday still.
[02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:03.670]  It's true. It's true.
[02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:05.270]  So...
[02:54:05.270 --> 02:54:07.670]  Looking at the board for tomorrow...
[02:54:09.150 --> 02:54:10.390]  I'm eight to the star.
[02:54:10.530 --> 02:54:11.970]  Geoff is seven to the...
[02:54:11.970 --> 02:54:13.610]  or six to the star, but that's not going to matter
[02:54:13.610 --> 02:54:15.690]  after I get it. And then, uh...
[02:54:15.690 --> 02:54:16.830]  Let's see here.
[02:54:17.250 --> 02:54:19.150]  DK, you're one away from Boo.
[02:54:20.210 --> 02:54:22.210]  But you're three coins shy
[02:54:22.210 --> 02:54:23.790]  to be able to steal a star, right?
[02:54:23.970 --> 02:54:25.570]  I'll get some coins at least.
[02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:27.090]  I got that going for me.
[02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:29.530]  Yeah, but he won't be able to steal on this turn.
[02:54:29.570 --> 02:54:30.590]  But he can steal coins.
[02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:30.950]  Okay.
[02:54:31.570 --> 02:54:34.890]  And then Gavin will be able to pivot off
[02:54:34.890 --> 02:54:36.470]  of when the star moves to the other track.
[02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.690]  Yep.
[02:54:37.850 --> 02:54:40.270]  And he can put down some of those star steals.
[02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:41.430]  What a play.
[02:54:43.530 --> 02:54:44.590]  It's getting spicy.
[02:54:45.390 --> 02:54:46.530]  It's definitely getting spicy.
[02:54:46.750 --> 02:54:48.330]  I cannot wait for turn 20.
[02:54:48.470 --> 02:54:49.150]  The final 10.
[02:54:49.350 --> 02:54:50.710]  Only 10 turns.
[02:54:51.810 --> 02:54:54.450]  What will it bring? The return of Dill?
[02:54:54.890 --> 02:54:56.230]  Get ready, Dillionaires.
[02:54:56.250 --> 02:54:57.130]  You get ready.
[02:54:57.130 --> 02:54:58.310]  Okay, cool.
[02:54:58.570 --> 02:55:00.170]  Does it matter if you support USD?
[02:55:00.330 --> 02:55:02.590]  C-A-D? C-A-Dill?
[02:55:03.210 --> 02:55:05.050]  N-Z-D? N-Z-Dill?
[02:55:05.250 --> 02:55:06.170]  G-B-P.
[02:55:07.090 --> 02:55:08.630]  That's your problem. I don't know.
[02:55:08.910 --> 02:55:09.610]  He's a pill.
[02:55:11.010 --> 02:55:13.510]  It's not a Dill Nation by the sounds of it.
[02:55:14.970 --> 02:55:16.430]  I think this is where you live, right?
[02:55:16.530 --> 02:55:19.170]  Alright, well, thanks for watching.
[02:55:19.270 --> 02:55:20.070]  We'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
[02:55:20.530 --> 02:55:20.810]  Bye.
[02:55:23.050 --> 02:55:23.930]  Turn 20.
[02:55:23.930 --> 02:55:25.770]  It's time. Let's do it.
[02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:26.830]  We're in the back third.
[02:55:27.110 --> 02:55:30.210]  I'm so excited. I'm a little nervous.
[02:55:30.710 --> 02:55:31.970]  I'm so excited.
[02:55:32.130 --> 02:55:33.390]  I'm a little nervous.
[02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:35.130]  This has potential to be big drama.
[02:55:35.490 --> 02:55:35.970]  No!
[02:55:37.430 --> 02:55:38.850]  What are you doing?
[02:55:39.890 --> 02:55:41.390]  Do you have to use that now?
[02:55:43.770 --> 02:55:45.270]  What? No, I can just... never mind.
[02:55:46.510 --> 02:55:47.690]  Wait, no. Did I just burn it?
[02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:50.150]  Nick!
[02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:53.450]  Dude, I hope you don't get the star.
[02:55:53.670 --> 02:55:54.450]  Geoff, this is all you.
[02:55:55.550 --> 02:55:56.690]  My controller died.
[02:55:56.830 --> 02:55:58.070]  I'm so sorry, Nick.
[02:55:59.670 --> 02:56:00.150]  I...
[02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:02.990]  I didn't want to do it.
[02:56:03.910 --> 02:56:05.910]  You could still roll an 8 or above.
[02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:07.510]  You did it.
[02:56:09.570 --> 02:56:10.530]  I, uh...
[02:56:10.530 --> 02:56:11.770]  Geoff, all you did...
[02:56:11.770 --> 02:56:13.150]  It's just for the taking.
[02:56:13.570 --> 02:56:15.030]  What did I miss?
[02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:17.450]  I didn't see anything. My controller died.
[02:56:17.450 --> 02:56:19.430]  I was just on the reconnect screen.
[02:56:19.510 --> 02:56:21.990]  It just started hitting buttons and it fucked them.
[02:56:22.510 --> 02:56:22.910]  What?
[02:56:23.490 --> 02:56:25.690]  I think you two are getting cleared out.
[02:56:25.950 --> 02:56:26.710]  Wait, what?
[02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:28.290]  I'm getting launched somewhere.
[02:56:28.850 --> 02:56:30.510]  Yeah, but not Geoff. Just Nick.
[02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:33.590]  Oh, to the beginning?
[02:56:34.190 --> 02:56:35.090]  Have we ever hit that yet?
[02:56:35.510 --> 02:56:37.430]  No, I don't think anyone's landed there yet.
[02:56:37.910 --> 02:56:39.490]  And Geoff, instead of using the double dice
[02:56:39.490 --> 02:56:41.630]  to guarantee himself the star pretty much,
[02:56:41.810 --> 02:56:43.310]  he accidentally used his shop
[02:56:43.970 --> 02:56:45.690]  phone, then backed out of the shop,
[02:56:45.690 --> 02:56:48.070]  burning the phone, and not being able to use the double dice.
[02:56:48.490 --> 02:56:49.930]  So now, that star is
[02:56:49.930 --> 02:56:51.350]  pretty much all yours.
[02:56:51.430 --> 02:56:52.150]  Now it's yours.
[02:56:55.450 --> 02:56:56.410]  I, uh...
[02:56:57.370 --> 02:56:58.110]  That's worse
[02:56:58.110 --> 02:56:58.890]  than I even thought.
[02:56:59.170 --> 02:57:01.630]  That was so embarrassing for you.
[02:57:01.630 --> 02:57:02.330]  I'm stunned.
[02:57:02.690 --> 02:57:06.070]  Yeah, I, uh...
[02:57:07.630 --> 02:57:09.790]  I'm just gonna go ahead and turn this off.
[02:57:10.210 --> 02:57:12.110]  If anybody wanted to know what it takes
[02:57:12.110 --> 02:57:13.670]  for a JoyCon controller to die,
[02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:15.150]  it takes 20 recordings.
[02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:16.530]  You haven't plugged it in that whole time?
[02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:17.430]  Oh, mine died already.
[02:57:17.850 --> 02:57:20.110]  Just FYI. That was the first time mine died.
[02:57:20.590 --> 02:57:22.010]  Alright, I guess I'll do a payday.
[02:57:22.030 --> 02:57:23.230]  Put another star trap down?
[02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:24.890]  Nah.
[02:57:26.170 --> 02:57:28.410]  Just wanna get near the star.
[02:57:29.430 --> 02:57:30.690]  That's all part of the plan.
[02:57:31.410 --> 02:57:32.610]  A very bad plan.
[02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:34.230]  You're at the beginning.
[02:57:35.030 --> 02:57:36.030]  Yeah, I know. I'm gonna get money.
[02:57:39.350 --> 02:57:40.830]  Alright, let's keep it low-ish.
[02:57:40.830 --> 02:57:42.810]  7, 2, 1...
[02:57:42.810 --> 02:57:43.790]  Oh my god!
[02:57:45.570 --> 02:57:48.030]  Dang. Wow.
[02:57:50.110 --> 02:57:51.670]  Does that mean I can just go get it?
[02:57:51.850 --> 02:57:54.550]  I can't believe I gave this to Gavin.
[02:57:54.770 --> 02:57:56.890]  You gave it to him. You handed it to him.
[02:57:57.510 --> 02:57:58.850]  Are you in an alliance with Gavin?
[02:57:59.230 --> 02:57:59.550]  No.
[02:58:00.470 --> 02:58:02.470]  Did you want Gavin to have four stars?
[02:58:02.690 --> 02:58:02.990]  No.
[02:58:03.470 --> 02:58:05.290]  Are you sure? Because he has it now.
[02:58:06.650 --> 02:58:08.870]  I was just hoping to roll
[02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:10.890]  less than the star on the other side, to be honest.
[02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:11.970]  So I could have Geoff get that one.
[02:58:12.070 --> 02:58:13.430]  But I didn't even expect that.
[02:58:16.750 --> 02:58:17.510]  Four stars.
[02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.930]  That's pretty crazy.
[02:58:21.770 --> 02:58:23.450]  Imagine if Nick had two stars.
[02:58:24.030 --> 02:58:25.530]  Nick is in Gavin's pocket.
[02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:28.430]  I wish.
[02:58:28.730 --> 02:58:29.650]  I honestly wish.
[02:58:30.050 --> 02:58:31.030]  What did he pay you, Nick?
[02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:33.690]  Did he pay you in Philly cheesesteaks?
[02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:36.790]  Gavin, can I have a Philly cheesesteak for my mistakes?
[02:58:38.770 --> 02:58:39.490]  Philly cheesesteaks?
[02:58:41.470 --> 02:58:43.030]  Would a Philly cheesesteak
[02:58:43.730 --> 02:58:45.290]  get you off my back for the rest of the game?
[02:58:46.570 --> 02:58:48.690]  That should be a thing. Philly cheesesteaks.
[02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.970]  It's the apology.
[02:58:50.650 --> 02:58:53.030]  Yeah, you gotta give somebody a Philly cheesesteak.
[02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.350]  Witwiz.
[02:58:55.890 --> 02:58:57.150]  You're having a rough turn, Nick,
[02:58:57.170 --> 02:58:58.590]  and I'm real sorry. I'm gonna have to continue.
[02:58:59.110 --> 02:59:00.530]  Listen, I don't regret you.
[02:59:00.870 --> 02:59:01.710]  No, fuck, no, no, no.
[02:59:01.710 --> 02:59:03.550]  Do it, do it, do it.
[02:59:03.570 --> 02:59:07.110]  You gotta take it from him because of the coins.
[02:59:07.250 --> 02:59:08.590]  You just have such a high percentage.
[02:59:09.210 --> 02:59:12.430]  I don't even think it's the percentage, I just think it needs to be continued punishment.
[02:59:13.410 --> 02:59:15.830]  I think it's just Bowser's not really doing his revolutions
[02:59:15.830 --> 02:59:17.350]  that much, so we have to.
[02:59:17.470 --> 02:59:19.710]  I was pounding the shit out of that button.
[02:59:20.010 --> 02:59:21.350]  I got eight out of that.
[02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:21.970]  Great.
[02:59:23.170 --> 02:59:26.270]  So it doesn't matter how many coins you have.
[02:59:27.050 --> 02:59:28.010]  Oh my god.
[02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:29.030]  Great.
[02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:30.570]  Oh my god.
[02:59:30.910 --> 02:59:32.310]  Don't redistribute wealth.
[02:59:32.650 --> 02:59:33.970]  Don't redistribute the coins.
[02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:35.410]  Do it.
[02:59:35.470 --> 02:59:37.010]  I could do with some redistribution.
[02:59:37.530 --> 02:59:40.230]  No, you couldn't, you four star heaven mother.
[02:59:40.790 --> 02:59:41.890]  Yeah, but twelve coin heaven.
[02:59:42.290 --> 02:59:43.470]  Receive a hundred stars.
[02:59:44.530 --> 02:59:44.750]  Yes!
[02:59:45.710 --> 02:59:46.310]  Yes!
[02:59:47.930 --> 02:59:49.170]  Oh my god.
[02:59:49.350 --> 02:59:50.170]  Oh, Nick.
[02:59:51.850 --> 02:59:54.150]  Nick, this might be your worst turn.
[02:59:55.750 --> 02:59:57.490]  He heard me complain
[02:59:57.490 --> 02:59:58.910]  that he hasn't been revoluting.
[03:00:01.530 --> 03:00:02.690]  Oh, 183.
[03:00:06.870 --> 03:00:08.030]  Oh, Rich.
[03:00:08.510 --> 03:00:10.850]  I got 72 now.
[03:00:10.930 --> 03:00:12.390]  I got like 60 coins there.
[03:00:17.010 --> 03:00:19.870]  Nick, I just got my coins back.
[03:00:20.470 --> 03:00:21.890]  This is a legendary turn.
[03:00:22.910 --> 03:00:24.370]  This is a legendary game.
[03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:25.950]  Playing it one turn at a time
[03:00:25.950 --> 03:00:27.470]  is absolutely amazing.
[03:00:27.710 --> 03:00:29.230]  It's amazing how different it can be.
[03:00:29.730 --> 03:00:30.750]  Oh my god.
[03:00:30.890 --> 03:00:32.170]  I thought...
[03:00:32.970 --> 03:00:36.430]  I'm 55 to the star, so it's going to be a while.
[03:00:37.410 --> 03:00:39.350]  Geoff, you could put down
[03:00:39.350 --> 03:00:41.450]  a star token
[03:00:41.450 --> 03:00:43.870]  and ensure that someone who's coming for a star
[03:00:43.870 --> 03:00:44.970]  might have to land on it.
[03:00:45.170 --> 03:00:48.610]  You know, I'm thinking about that because we're running out of turns.
[03:00:48.970 --> 03:00:50.270]  So the sooner I put them down,
[03:00:50.370 --> 03:00:50.690]  the better.
[03:00:50.890 --> 03:00:52.850]  This isn't necessarily where I would want to put it.
[03:00:52.850 --> 03:00:54.590]  You have two of them, though.
[03:00:54.870 --> 03:00:56.410]  Gotta do what you gotta do.
[03:00:56.750 --> 03:00:57.350]  That's what I'm thinking.
[03:00:58.310 --> 03:00:59.750]  Oh, you can put them in multiple spots?
[03:00:59.910 --> 03:01:02.650]  You can just throw it around you.
[03:01:03.250 --> 03:01:04.210]  In one spot around you.
[03:01:04.270 --> 03:01:05.010]  I like that one.
[03:01:05.310 --> 03:01:06.870]  What is it, like two spots away, max?
[03:01:07.330 --> 03:01:08.290]  Oh, wow.
[03:01:10.310 --> 03:01:11.370]  There you go.
[03:01:12.310 --> 03:01:13.270]  What if you land on it?
[03:01:16.690 --> 03:01:18.930]  I take it from my right pocket and put it in my left pocket.
[03:01:19.470 --> 03:01:20.750]  Oh, nice, Geoff.
[03:01:20.750 --> 03:01:21.710]  Thank you.
[03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:23.470]  Watch, he's gonna get another one.
[03:01:24.130 --> 03:01:24.590]  Oh!
[03:01:26.250 --> 03:01:27.450]  I'm in a minigame.
[03:01:28.390 --> 03:01:31.230]  Cool, this is gonna be a very long turn for some reason.
[03:01:33.130 --> 03:01:33.590]  Horizontal.
[03:01:36.990 --> 03:01:38.410]  Oh, you got this, Geoff.
[03:01:38.490 --> 03:01:38.950]  Easy.
[03:01:40.030 --> 03:01:42.170]  Tilt to guide the ball.
[03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:44.150]  Which one do I want?
[03:01:44.750 --> 03:01:46.150]  You want the back, the top right.
[03:01:47.450 --> 03:01:48.550]  Or the triple.
[03:01:52.050 --> 03:01:52.630]  Tease it.
[03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:53.490]  Tease it.
[03:01:54.230 --> 03:01:55.370]  He's gonna run out of time.
[03:01:57.710 --> 03:01:58.650]  I've never done that before.
[03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:59.610]  That thing's serious.
[03:02:00.250 --> 03:02:01.930]  You've made like a million turns of this.
[03:02:02.230 --> 03:02:03.470]  I've never seen that before.
[03:02:05.810 --> 03:02:06.790]  I'll do it again.
[03:02:08.250 --> 03:02:08.810]  Take two.
[03:02:10.190 --> 03:02:10.850]  We'll run it back.
[03:02:12.050 --> 03:02:12.490]  Double ice.
[03:02:13.430 --> 03:02:14.710]  This has to be a dream, right?
[03:02:15.390 --> 03:02:16.850]  Nope, it's a nightmare, Nick, and you're living it.
[03:02:17.170 --> 03:02:17.970]  Welcome to life, buddy.
[03:02:17.970 --> 03:02:19.930]  I can't believe you binned your shop.
[03:02:19.970 --> 03:02:21.750]  You fucked it up so bad.
[03:02:21.770 --> 03:02:24.690]  Why would I give you the option to never mind?
[03:02:24.990 --> 03:02:26.070]  Who the fuck...
[03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:31.510]  Oh, the millionaires going up against you guys.
[03:02:31.630 --> 03:02:32.390]  I'm so bad at this.
[03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:35.430]  Gavin, you're one shape.
[03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.750]  I'm one shape.
[03:02:37.210 --> 03:02:39.550]  You have one fucking shape, Gavin.
[03:02:40.290 --> 03:02:42.110]  Okay, well, let's do a little practice, yeah?
[03:02:42.290 --> 03:02:43.110]  Yeah, go ahead, Geoff.
[03:02:44.490 --> 03:02:45.390]  Alright, fine.
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:49.540]  Okay, good.
[03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:51.700]  Okay, we got it.
[03:02:52.060 --> 03:02:53.260]  Okay, good, he said.
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:54.260]  Because last time I forgot.
[03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:57.320]  Okay, now just make sure that you are the one that we just saw, okay?
[03:02:58.660 --> 03:02:59.460]  Alright, so...
[03:02:59.980 --> 03:03:00.780]  I'm square.
[03:03:03.340 --> 03:03:03.740]  Okay.
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:05.480]  Faster, please.
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:06.700]  Doing great.
[03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:09.000]  You're ahead of Andrew.
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:12.080]  You're way ahead of Andrew.
[03:03:12.540 --> 03:03:13.660]  You're blowing him out of the water, boys.
[03:03:13.660 --> 03:03:14.300]  Ah!
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:17.340]  You're blowing him out of the water.
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:18.480]  Yeah.
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:20.740]  Oh, you guys got this.
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:23.780]  Andrew hates cookies. It's a thing I know about him.
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:25.540]  They're locked in.
[03:03:25.540 --> 03:03:27.460]  Andrew hates cookies like Eric hates spaghetti.
[03:03:27.720 --> 03:03:28.500]  Oh, boy.
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:30.580]  Spaghetti on your head, Sal, this is awesome.
[03:03:32.660 --> 03:03:34.960]  I think we almost got like five full trays there.
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:36.220]  Yeah, that's a lot of cookies.
[03:03:38.780 --> 03:03:40.160]  That's gotta be almost 100 cookies.
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:42.540]  Our bakery empire is off to a great start.
[03:03:42.540 --> 03:03:43.220]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:46.020]  That game's a lot easier when you know how it works.
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:49.060]  I don't understand what you didn't understand.
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:50.560]  I don't either.
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:52.420]  Looking back on it, I don't know what I was confused about.
[03:03:53.460 --> 03:03:55.480]  But that's how I spend a lot of my life, to be honest.
[03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:01.180]  But now, this might be my favorite part
[03:04:01.180 --> 03:04:01.860]  where
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:04.500]  Nick has to look at the board
[03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:06.440]  and let us know where everything's at
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:07.540]  and then he can...
[03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:08.880]  Oh, ankle.
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:11.420]  His friend left that.
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:17.560]  I didn't realize that I could have gotten
[03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:18.840]  two stars with that either.
[03:04:19.100 --> 03:04:20.420]  Yeah, you blew it.
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:22.600]  You had the money for it, easily.
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:24.980]  You could have also maybe
[03:04:24.980 --> 03:04:25.720]  hit Boo on the way out.
[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:28.700]  And now everyone has the money for it, bud.
[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:31.260]  Could have been four stars, maybe, potentially.
[03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:33.140]  You could have actually got four stars
[03:04:33.140 --> 03:04:34.000]  that turn on a high roll.
[03:04:34.980 --> 03:04:36.040]  Looking at the big board.
[03:04:39.780 --> 03:04:40.780]  Uh, let's see.
[03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:42.500]  We're all a bit of a ways from the star.
[03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:44.880]  I have the best shot at it, probably, unless I roll something stupid.
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:46.280]  And then, uh...
[03:04:46.280 --> 03:04:48.620]  In theory, Geoff?
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:50.560]  Yes. In practice, probably not.
[03:04:51.460 --> 03:04:52.180]  Uh, Dilkong
[03:04:52.180 --> 03:04:54.640]  can choose whether he's going to get an item
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:04:56.880]  or coins.
[03:04:57.040 --> 03:04:58.880]  But he does have to get past one more
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:00.420]  Bowser, so he needs to roll
[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:01.520]  at least a two.
[03:05:01.860 --> 03:05:04.740]  I don't know why he'd need to get coins, though.
[03:05:04.780 --> 03:05:05.760]  He has all of yours.
[03:05:06.260 --> 03:05:08.400]  Well, I mean, he has a percentage of mine.
[03:05:09.240 --> 03:05:10.300]  And they were his.
[03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:13.440]  Gavin has, like, two of my stars.
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:16.720]  Is that what he has?
[03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:17.680]  Is that what Gavin has?
[03:05:17.920 --> 03:05:18.960]  They've become mine now.
[03:05:19.540 --> 03:05:20.480]  No, I don't think so.
[03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:25.580]  You know what they say?
[03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:27.480]  Possession is nine-tenths of the star.
[03:05:27.920 --> 03:05:28.680]  It's true.
[03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:31.700]  Incredible turn. Legendary turn.
[03:05:31.800 --> 03:05:33.280]  A turn that will be talked about for ages.
[03:05:33.280 --> 03:05:35.280]  Really something special.
[03:05:35.460 --> 03:05:37.700]  Excited to see where turn 21 takes us.
[03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:39.240]  But you have to watch that tomorrow.
[03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:40.840]  So thanks for joining us, and we'll see you tomorrow.
[03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:41.700]  Bye!
[03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:42.620]  Bye!
[03:05:46.240 --> 03:05:48.000]  Editor, leave that part in.
[03:05:50.220 --> 03:05:51.260]  Smooth sailing.
[03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:52.040]  Turn 21.
[03:05:52.360 --> 03:05:53.700]  Have a drink.
[03:05:54.280 --> 03:05:57.280]  Days like today make it particularly frustrating when people don't believe
[03:05:57.280 --> 03:05:58.320]  we're doing this daily.
[03:05:58.700 --> 03:05:59.740]  Jesus Christ.
[03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:01.820]  I would love to batch record this.
[03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:03.560]  That'd be awesome. Nick, why are you using these?
[03:06:04.140 --> 03:06:06.320]  I had to live with my decision for 24 hours.
[03:06:06.680 --> 03:06:07.260]  Nick, why are you...
[03:06:07.260 --> 03:06:08.880]  Did you mean to use a different item?
[03:06:10.160 --> 03:06:11.420]  I only had one item.
[03:06:11.580 --> 03:06:13.840]  I looked at it yesterday, Nick,
[03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:15.520]  when I was proofing yesterday's episode.
[03:06:15.900 --> 03:06:17.800]  If you'd have rolled a 19 or a 20,
[03:06:17.940 --> 03:06:19.080]  you would have got four stars.
[03:06:19.480 --> 03:06:20.280]  Oh, man.
[03:06:21.280 --> 03:06:24.340]  Trust me, I looked at every possible scenario.
[03:06:26.420 --> 03:06:28.660]  And this was the worst outcome.
[03:06:28.660 --> 03:06:29.520]  Pretty cool, man.
[03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:32.360]  The worst outcome.
[03:06:32.780 --> 03:06:33.740]  Let's see.
[03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:35.380]  You got more than enough coins.
[03:06:35.780 --> 03:06:38.200]  Maybe I can make up for it here.
[03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:39.240]  Ooh.
[03:06:39.720 --> 03:06:41.080]  There you go.
[03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:44.860]  A bit of a star steal.
[03:06:46.480 --> 03:06:47.700]  Nice. Excellent.
[03:06:51.420 --> 03:06:55.020]  So, yeah, I had to sit with it yesterday.
[03:06:55.280 --> 03:06:56.680]  And that was a task.
[03:06:56.680 --> 03:06:57.060]  That was tough.
[03:06:57.200 --> 03:07:02.060]  As soon as the phone popped off into nothingness,
[03:07:02.180 --> 03:07:03.660]  your sigh was so real.
[03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:06.280]  It was actually kind of tragic.
[03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:08.440]  It was pretty cool.
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:10.940]  It would have been sad if it wasn't hilarious.
[03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:12.960]  Yeah, it wasn't even like playing, Nick.
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:14.300]  It was just real life, Nick.
[03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:16.800]  You're on my mind all day yesterday, Nick.
[03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:18.760]  As someone who lost 69 coins in one turn,
[03:07:18.840 --> 03:07:19.480]  I just knew.
[03:07:19.860 --> 03:07:21.540]  I knew the dread.
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:24.860]  Oh, yeah? Have you ever given up four stars
[03:07:24.860 --> 03:07:26.080]  in a single turn as well?
[03:07:26.900 --> 03:07:28.820]  I don't know if I want to put my
[03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:30.000]  star trap on it.
[03:07:31.220 --> 03:07:32.620]  Why not? Why wouldn't you put it down here
[03:07:32.620 --> 03:07:34.540]  right after a star? Someone would buy a star
[03:07:34.540 --> 03:07:35.640]  and then maybe they land on this.
[03:07:36.040 --> 03:07:38.940]  Yeah, I just feel like putting it after when the roads rejoin
[03:07:38.940 --> 03:07:41.220]  is going to be better than putting it on the single road.
[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:43.200]  He's got a good point, actually.
[03:07:43.740 --> 03:07:45.860]  It's like God gave you two.
[03:07:47.500 --> 03:07:48.640]  Why am I giving him tips?
[03:07:49.140 --> 03:07:49.960]  Put one down.
[03:07:51.580 --> 03:07:51.940]  Sucker.
[03:07:51.940 --> 03:07:53.560]  Burn it.
[03:07:54.080 --> 03:07:54.460]  Beep.
[03:07:58.260 --> 03:07:58.780]  Beep.
[03:07:58.880 --> 03:07:59.920]  I'll chuck it here.
[03:08:00.720 --> 03:08:01.240]  Yep.
[03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:03.480]  Once again, another
[03:08:03.480 --> 03:08:04.280]  clover.
[03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:07.280]  Because now if the mole rolls one,
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:08.260]  it's pretty exciting.
[03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:13.160]  DK's still in the danger zone today.
[03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:14.240]  I think I don't want to hit
[03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:17.320]  a 5, 6, or a 7.
[03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:18.940]  Okay.
[03:08:20.340 --> 03:08:20.780]  No
[03:08:20.780 --> 03:08:21.960]  concern about that, I guess.
[03:08:24.660 --> 03:08:25.760]  Oh, I'll take one of them.
[03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:27.160]  Perfect.
[03:08:30.260 --> 03:08:31.180]  Just what he needed.
[03:08:31.820 --> 03:08:33.400]  Okay, let's go for a big roll.
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:35.280]  I'm in no man's land.
[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:36.640]  Let's get these guys going.
[03:08:38.140 --> 03:08:39.440]  Billionaires, get ready.
[03:08:40.180 --> 03:08:41.200]  We got them golden
[03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:41.600]  wheels.
[03:08:42.820 --> 03:08:44.140]  Are you worried about going past it?
[03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:46.960]  I mean, I'm 33 away. That'd be pretty hot.
[03:08:46.960 --> 03:08:48.120]  Yeah, no, no, I'm not worried.
[03:08:50.380 --> 03:08:51.640]  Certainly not worried.
[03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:53.280]  I don't think he's going to get halfway there.
[03:08:53.540 --> 03:08:55.220]  This is going about the way I expected.
[03:08:57.060 --> 03:08:57.540]  Yep.
[03:08:58.980 --> 03:08:59.640]  That's fine.
[03:09:01.480 --> 03:09:02.200]  Doesn't matter.
[03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:02.860]  Nope.
[03:09:05.380 --> 03:09:08.280]  Okay, it does matter.
[03:09:08.560 --> 03:09:10.760]  Fuck. Jesus Christ.
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:14.700]  Now how do I play this next?
[03:09:14.700 --> 03:09:17.240]  Alright, it's mole time, boys.
[03:09:17.640 --> 03:09:18.920]  Put the star steal trap
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:19.820]  on Gavin's.
[03:09:20.540 --> 03:09:22.200]  Could you trap a trap?
[03:09:23.420 --> 03:09:24.780]  I think that'd be bollocks.
[03:09:26.800 --> 03:09:28.180]  See, that's what I'm talking about.
[03:09:28.300 --> 03:09:28.780]  Wow.
[03:09:29.940 --> 03:09:30.440]  Wow.
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:32.860]  Geoff.
[03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:35.520]  Given how I roll, I knew.
[03:09:36.700 --> 03:09:38.260]  Now that's interesting.
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:39.880]  Mario only has one star.
[03:09:40.020 --> 03:09:42.440]  You could really make something interesting happen here.
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:43.520]  Don't make it interesting.
[03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:45.760]  You could definitely make it pretty interesting.
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:48.320]  Listen, I could probably just go
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:49.420]  random, right?
[03:09:50.040 --> 03:09:52.820]  That might be the fairest way to do this.
[03:09:52.940 --> 03:09:53.900]  Look, who has the most coins?
[03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:55.060]  I'm a fair man.
[03:09:55.620 --> 03:09:57.400]  Oh my God.
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:09:59.500]  Nick, I'm so sorry.
[03:10:01.900 --> 03:10:04.520]  Oh, Nick. Oh, that hurts even me.
[03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:06.720]  Nick, I'm so sorry. I didn't choose you.
[03:10:06.880 --> 03:10:07.480]  Fame did.
[03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:09.760]  God chose you.
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:10.800]  Oh my God.
[03:10:11.160 --> 03:10:12.520]  You're on the fucking list.
[03:10:12.760 --> 03:10:14.480]  You can't put me on the list.
[03:10:15.860 --> 03:10:17.480]  I didn't pick you.
[03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:19.960]  I didn't pick you.
[03:10:20.520 --> 03:10:22.100]  Congratulations on your star, dude.
[03:10:22.100 --> 03:10:23.400]  You got three? That's pretty awesome.
[03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:24.420]  That's pretty cool.
[03:10:25.940 --> 03:10:28.020]  My list is just the three of you.
[03:10:28.060 --> 03:10:30.240]  Yeah, Nick's list is just the people playing the game.
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:32.280]  Oh, God.
[03:10:32.440 --> 03:10:33.120]  Dill again.
[03:10:33.300 --> 03:10:35.480]  God, I fucking hate Mario Party.
[03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:38.160]  That's a squeaky shakedown.
[03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:41.800]  Oh my God, I can't believe that.
[03:10:42.060 --> 03:10:43.720]  As soon as you didn't pick Gavin,
[03:10:43.820 --> 03:10:45.460]  I knew it was Nick. That's so exciting.
[03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:47.520]  If you take my money,
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:49.120]  I will come after you.
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:52.340]  I'm the bottom of the list
[03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:53.740]  if I take it. There's no way
[03:10:53.740 --> 03:10:54.860]  you'd put me at the top.
[03:10:55.520 --> 03:10:56.500]  You will be at the top.
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:10:59.200]  This whole game is taking money, Nick.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.800]  I'm gonna take some of your money.
[03:11:04.020 --> 03:11:05.180]  Just take their money.
[03:11:05.860 --> 03:11:07.880]  Nick, I didn't take that star for the record.
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:09.540]  You took the star.
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:11.300]  The universe took the star.
[03:11:11.540 --> 03:11:13.940]  I left it up to chance. It was cosmic.
[03:11:14.260 --> 03:11:16.060]  He's unfairly targeting me.
[03:11:16.540 --> 03:11:17.100]  Unfairly?
[03:11:17.980 --> 03:11:19.760]  Dill Kong. Dill Kong.
[03:11:20.540 --> 03:11:21.500]  Dill Kong.
[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:23.780]  Dill Kong, you bastard.
[03:11:24.380 --> 03:11:26.200]  Well, Gavin, you gotta get near the other guys.
[03:11:26.360 --> 03:11:27.720]  That way, maybe he goes after them.
[03:11:28.720 --> 03:11:29.280]  No!
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:31.240]  Don't you fucking touch me!
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:34.240]  I completely emptied the coffers
[03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:35.440]  of one of the other players.
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:36.100]  It's alright.
[03:11:38.420 --> 03:11:39.380]  Thank you, Andrew.
[03:11:39.660 --> 03:11:41.240]  And that was a double coin as well.
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:42.640]  Andrew, you bastard.
[03:11:43.380 --> 03:11:45.840]  I don't even know what double coin means in this context.
[03:11:46.420 --> 03:11:47.560]  You get double the coins.
[03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:49.340]  It's pretty clear what it means.
[03:11:50.020 --> 03:11:51.440]  Well, typically...
[03:11:53.640 --> 03:11:54.520]  Typically what?
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:11:56.040]  See, Gavin, you got 22.
[03:11:56.680 --> 03:11:58.080]  Oh, so it was like a joint?
[03:11:58.460 --> 03:11:58.700]  Yeah.
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:02.320]  At least you got one.
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:04.040]  I forgot it was three versus one.
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:06.100]  We're gonna start with Nick.
[03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:09.040]  But Nick, why don't you show us where we stand on the board?
[03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:10.060]  I'm so excited.
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:12.220]  Eric, I'm so pumped.
[03:12:12.500 --> 03:12:14.020]  DK is 11 away from a star.
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:15.480]  I don't know if he has any items to get in there.
[03:12:15.540 --> 03:12:16.400]  He doesn't, looks like.
[03:12:16.540 --> 03:12:19.740]  So he's gonna have to rely on natural rolls to get him there.
[03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:23.260]  Meanwhile, Gavin can go to boo eventually.
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:24.620]  Or he can bypass it entirely
[03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:27.300]  if he rolls a 4, 5, or 6.
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:29.520]  And Geoff is coming up to the danger zone
[03:12:29.520 --> 03:12:30.320]  with the...
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:32.620]  What is it? The swap token?
[03:12:32.940 --> 03:12:33.400]  What is it called?
[03:12:34.820 --> 03:12:35.540]  Bowser revolution?
[03:12:36.400 --> 03:12:38.440]  No, the two Bowsers, but before that, the chance time space.
[03:12:38.500 --> 03:12:39.520]  Do you know how I lost all my stars?
[03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:41.380]  Oh, right, yes. Yeah, that's true.
[03:12:42.100 --> 03:12:42.520]  Nick remembers.
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:44.880]  Nick remembers.
[03:12:46.100 --> 03:12:48.620]  Well, if you want to see how Nick comes back
[03:12:48.620 --> 03:12:49.560]  and wins this whole thing
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:52.360]  as we've scripted, join us tomorrow
[03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:53.920]  where the Nick comeback begins.
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:55.880]  And we will see you next time.
[03:12:56.280 --> 03:12:56.640]  Bye!
[03:12:56.640 --> 03:12:57.020]  Bye!
[03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:00.740]  Oh boys, I don't know
[03:13:00.740 --> 03:13:02.620]  about you, but it's day 22.
[03:13:03.140 --> 03:13:04.680]  I'm ready to see
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:06.660]  how this one goes, because we're starting with
[03:13:06.660 --> 03:13:07.940]  Nick and it's getting crazy.
[03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:10.780]  Whoa, straight off
[03:13:10.780 --> 03:13:12.280]  the bat, no pissing about.
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:13.280]  What are you doing, Nick?
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:15.160]  No hesitation.
[03:13:15.940 --> 03:13:18.660]  You know what, I'm gonna put it on these, because there's a double chance
[03:13:18.660 --> 03:13:19.380]  you land on it.
[03:13:20.700 --> 03:13:21.940]  Is it double chance?
[03:13:22.240 --> 03:13:23.000]  It's pretty good.
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:23.440]  Smart.
[03:13:25.100 --> 03:13:27.100]  How's it double chance?
[03:13:27.220 --> 03:13:27.880]  Is that how that works?
[03:13:28.340 --> 03:13:29.520]  Maybe, we'll find out.
[03:13:29.700 --> 03:13:30.800]  You get flung to one of those.
[03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:34.920]  Also, don't these flip over
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:35.420]  at some point?
[03:13:37.340 --> 03:13:38.220]  Yeah, probably.
[03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:39.580]  What happens when it flips?
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:41.320]  They probably stay there.
[03:13:42.100 --> 03:13:42.980]  Yeah, probably.
[03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:44.240]  I'm not a scientist.
[03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:47.920]  That was a good roll for the Dilkong.
[03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:49.140]  Oh boy.
[03:13:51.940 --> 03:13:53.820]  It's a decent roll for me, too,
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:55.980]  in that I can see where it's going next.
[03:13:56.560 --> 03:13:57.240]  For sure.
[03:13:58.560 --> 03:13:59.960]  You better hope Gavin
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:01.720]  doesn't go past nine, because if he does, he has to take
[03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:03.160]  one of his shoes and socks off.
[03:14:04.860 --> 03:14:05.920]  I'd have to do what?
[03:14:06.540 --> 03:14:06.780]  What?
[03:14:10.980 --> 03:14:13.880]  Oh, he's dice blocking.
[03:14:14.300 --> 03:14:15.360]  Here we go, block it up.
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:17.140]  I don't want to land on something bad,
[03:14:17.220 --> 03:14:19.640]  and I don't want to miss good ol' booage.
[03:14:19.940 --> 03:14:21.540]  Oh, you're getting booed this turn?
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:22.060]  Yeah.
[03:14:23.180 --> 03:14:24.240]  Steal some coins from Nick.
[03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:26.640]  I've never felt safer, and yet,
[03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:29.720]  it's going to be bad for the rest of us.
[03:14:31.580 --> 03:14:32.580]  Wow, a ten!
[03:14:33.320 --> 03:14:34.660]  Who could have saw that coming?
[03:14:35.660 --> 03:14:37.220]  Now, we will see,
[03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:39.320]  Gavin, will fate be kind to you
[03:14:39.320 --> 03:14:41.140]  when I'm in this position again in the future?
[03:14:41.540 --> 03:14:41.980]  Interesting.
[03:14:41.980 --> 03:14:44.120]  Well, let's hope so, because I'm going to press random-
[03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:44.560]  ush.
[03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:47.040]  Go ahead and press random.
[03:14:47.180 --> 03:14:49.420]  Yeah, hit that random button.
[03:14:51.940 --> 03:14:53.500]  I don't like doing this, really.
[03:14:53.900 --> 03:14:55.200]  I feel like I've not been wronged.
[03:14:56.420 --> 03:14:57.920]  And yet, here we are.
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:14:58.840]  And yet, here we are.
[03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:01.640]  Here's a wrongin' from me.
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:03.300]  You chose a path.
[03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:05.440]  You don't have to do it.
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:08.580]  I mean, I think I've made it my personal
[03:15:08.580 --> 03:15:10.000]  mission just to make sure that
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:10.900]  Gavin doesn't win.
[03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:13.960]  Yeah, I'm about to get obliterated at every available opportunity
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:16.180]  by Dilkong and Mario, so I'm just gonna
[03:15:16.180 --> 03:15:18.060]  make a little buffer here.
[03:15:18.380 --> 03:15:19.580]  No, no, there's really not.
[03:15:19.880 --> 03:15:21.940]  Five stars? Think about how
[03:15:22.520 --> 03:15:24.360]  Nick could have had four stars.
[03:15:24.900 --> 03:15:25.840]  You rob the man,
[03:15:25.900 --> 03:15:27.520]  and then you park next to him to say hello.
[03:15:29.140 --> 03:15:30.660]  Well, it's because I've let you look at it.
[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:32.340]  Reach into your car and take that back.
[03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:33.780]  No, he just wanted to say,
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:34.740]  hey, have you seen my new star?
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:36.240]  Wow!
[03:15:36.240 --> 03:15:36.540]  Wow!
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:39.560]  Oh no!
[03:15:39.860 --> 03:15:40.200]  Oh no!
[03:15:40.480 --> 03:15:40.960]  Oh no!
[03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:42.260]  Oh no!
[03:15:42.980 --> 03:15:44.060]  Oh no!
[03:15:45.260 --> 03:15:46.420]  Oh no!
[03:15:47.020 --> 03:15:51.740]  Oh no, it's lined up real good for Nick!
[03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:53.700]  Oh no!
[03:15:54.080 --> 03:15:55.760]  This isn't what I wanted for you, Andrew!
[03:15:56.160 --> 03:15:57.680]  Oh man!
[03:15:59.280 --> 03:15:59.640]  Well,
[03:16:00.260 --> 03:16:00.960]  my star!
[03:16:02.980 --> 03:16:04.300]  I can't believe there
[03:16:04.300 --> 03:16:06.280]  were people that didn't want us to play this
[03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:08.240]  map. This is such a good
[03:16:08.240 --> 03:16:10.280]  board. This rocks. This is so
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:12.360]  much fun. Well, nobody's seen it in 30 turns
[03:16:12.360 --> 03:16:13.220]  in 30 days.
[03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:18.300]  I think I know what you
[03:16:18.300 --> 03:16:20.360]  need to do, Geoff. Hey, throw down a little
[03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:21.660]  star steel, baby. Yeah, throw a little
[03:16:22.060 --> 03:16:24.240]  star steel action. Yeah, I'm
[03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:25.360]  looking at the map. Hold on.
[03:16:27.120 --> 03:16:27.400]  Okay.
[03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:30.340]  Yeah, I probably want to do that
[03:16:30.340 --> 03:16:31.620]  actually. You're probably right.
[03:16:31.620 --> 03:16:33.660]  Or you could do the triple roll
[03:16:33.660 --> 03:16:35.060]  and haul balls to the star.
[03:16:35.680 --> 03:16:37.300]  I'm not going to make it to the star
[03:16:37.300 --> 03:16:38.020]  that time.
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:39.520]  Okay.
[03:16:44.080 --> 03:16:45.700]  Oh, that's nasty.
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:47.680]  I don't have anything to
[03:16:47.680 --> 03:16:48.860]  avoid rolling a three.
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:51.920]  I think that's a two.
[03:16:52.380 --> 03:16:52.940]  Wow!
[03:16:54.780 --> 03:16:55.500]  Ooh, natural 10.
[03:16:55.500 --> 03:16:55.940]  30 turns.
[03:16:57.920 --> 03:16:59.180]  Ooh, do you want
[03:16:59.180 --> 03:16:59.800]  money or items?
[03:17:01.060 --> 03:17:02.900]  The items have been really helpful, Geoff.
[03:17:03.120 --> 03:17:05.260]  Yeah, I'm an item guy now.
[03:17:06.040 --> 03:17:07.040]  At this point, I'm backing
[03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:09.520]  Geoff. I'm backing you,
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:11.080]  Nick. I'm backing
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:12.400]  Geoff until I can get back in line.
[03:17:13.340 --> 03:17:14.360]  I'll take it.
[03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:17.380]  If it was a star,
[03:17:17.540 --> 03:17:19.080]  I want to see if Nick was still going to back you.
[03:17:19.540 --> 03:17:21.120]  That would have been tremendous.
[03:17:21.400 --> 03:17:23.140]  Oh, if it was a star, I probably
[03:17:23.140 --> 03:17:24.560]  would have changed my tune.
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:27.060]  You made me blue even though I landed on a green.
[03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:27.660]  Interesting.
[03:17:28.040 --> 03:17:30.640]  The greens are like a 50-50.
[03:17:30.940 --> 03:17:31.860]  Booze cruise.
[03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:35.100]  We're on a booze cruise.
[03:17:35.260 --> 03:17:36.520]  Let's do it.
[03:17:36.600 --> 03:17:38.500]  Is this the one where I hit?
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:41.160]  That's what UFC should do.
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:42.640]  They should have a bruise cruise
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:44.860]  where you just go and fight UFC people.
[03:17:46.060 --> 03:17:48.260]  Get on a boat and get your ass kicked.
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:51.960]  Bruise cruise.
[03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:54.440]  Israel Adesanya.
[03:17:54.440 --> 03:17:55.840]  Fucking roundhouse kicks.
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:17:58.000]  Oh my god.
[03:17:58.180 --> 03:17:58.740]  Geoff.
[03:17:59.300 --> 03:18:00.960]  I was laughing so hard.
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:04.640]  Are you just thinking about
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:06.200]  the style bender
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:07.460]  fucking laying you out?
[03:18:08.100 --> 03:18:09.940]  I was just thinking about
[03:18:09.940 --> 03:18:12.120]  in the fucking...
[03:18:12.120 --> 03:18:14.100]  Gotta be ready at all times.
[03:18:14.260 --> 03:18:16.800]  Get the fucking buffet line to get shrimp cocktail.
[03:18:17.060 --> 03:18:18.540]  Next thing you know, you're getting choked out.
[03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:19.340]  Go Gavin.
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:21.200]  No!
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:24.000]  We got him.
[03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:26.680]  We did it.
[03:18:27.640 --> 03:18:29.560]  What a piece of shit.
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:30.240]  Nick, you suck.
[03:18:30.900 --> 03:18:31.780]  Fuck nunchucks.
[03:18:33.160 --> 03:18:35.360]  Do you think that's
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:36.420]  what nunchucks are?
[03:18:37.380 --> 03:18:39.140]  The joys of the wee ones.
[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:39.600]  Yeah.
[03:18:40.860 --> 03:18:42.340]  Fuck nunchucks.
[03:18:43.180 --> 03:18:43.920]  99.
[03:18:44.480 --> 03:18:45.060]  Michaelangelo.
[03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:48.080]  No stars, huh?
[03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:49.000]  Mikey was a bitch.
[03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:51.280]  Use a killing weapon.
[03:18:52.180 --> 03:18:54.240]  That was a very quick round.
[03:18:54.460 --> 03:18:55.880]  But Nick, let's have a look at the board.
[03:18:56.400 --> 03:18:58.060]  Let's take a look at what happened.
[03:18:58.840 --> 03:18:59.080]  Alright.
[03:19:00.220 --> 03:19:01.660]  I'm 11 to the star.
[03:19:01.960 --> 03:19:03.260]  So I'm not getting a next turn.
[03:19:03.480 --> 03:19:05.480]  And I might accidentally drive away like Andrew.
[03:19:05.860 --> 03:19:08.560]  Andrew has three danger zones.
[03:19:08.980 --> 03:19:09.500]  Then boo.
[03:19:10.020 --> 03:19:11.620]  Then he could give me half his coins.
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:13.540]  Then he could actually give Geoff a star.
[03:19:14.040 --> 03:19:15.460]  There's a lot of danger coming up.
[03:19:15.460 --> 03:19:16.940]  And then beyond that,
[03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:19.260]  on the following turn, he'd have
[03:19:19.260 --> 03:19:21.300]  the chance time space and two
[03:19:21.300 --> 03:19:23.240]  bowsers. And Gavin has to deal with that next time.
[03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:24.840]  Along with the Geoff star space.
[03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:26.700]  And Geoff, well,
[03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:29.240]  you could give Gavin half your coins
[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:30.620]  and get some items.
[03:19:31.500 --> 03:19:32.220]  There's a lot of danger.
[03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:34.700]  So much danger. I hate it.
[03:19:35.940 --> 03:19:37.840]  Only seven days to go.
[03:19:38.620 --> 03:19:39.120]  Oh, man.
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:40.840]  Isn't there more than that?
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:41.940]  Well, eight.
[03:19:41.940 --> 03:19:42.880]  Eight.
[03:19:44.580 --> 03:19:45.960]  This turn 23?
[03:19:46.680 --> 03:19:48.360]  No, that was turn 22.
[03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:50.040]  Yeah, this is coming up.
[03:19:50.100 --> 03:19:51.660]  Turn 23. We've already done turn 23.
[03:19:53.460 --> 03:19:54.640]  Eight turns to go.
[03:19:55.280 --> 03:19:56.060]  That's what we said.
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:19:56.920]  Eight turns to go.
[03:19:59.160 --> 03:20:00.800]  We'll see you next time.
[03:20:01.400 --> 03:20:01.880]  Bye.
[03:20:05.060 --> 03:20:06.040]  We're back, baby.
[03:20:06.760 --> 03:20:09.020]  We're closing in on a week left.
[03:20:09.160 --> 03:20:10.440]  That's it. We're so close.
[03:20:10.440 --> 03:20:11.780]  I'm feeling a star today.
[03:20:12.560 --> 03:20:14.500]  I'm going to land on a steel star space
[03:20:14.500 --> 03:20:15.280]  and lose it, but
[03:20:16.260 --> 03:20:17.840]  for a brief moment, I'll feel alive.
[03:20:18.520 --> 03:20:19.680]  Whose star are you going to steal?
[03:20:20.740 --> 03:20:21.520]  Well, who do you think?
[03:20:23.060 --> 03:20:24.420]  You already stole mine, so I don't know what you're doing here.
[03:20:24.420 --> 03:20:25.100]  Yeah, Nick doesn't have any.
[03:20:25.440 --> 03:20:28.580]  I used to have more than zero, Gavin.
[03:20:29.340 --> 03:20:30.820]  I feel like I can maximize
[03:20:30.820 --> 03:20:32.120]  my chances.
[03:20:32.180 --> 03:20:34.880]  If you'd have attacked me at turn 20 instead of turn 15,
[03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:36.000]  none of this would have happened.
[03:20:36.900 --> 03:20:38.120]  I don't know about that.
[03:20:38.920 --> 03:20:40.580]  I mean, I was being pretty loyal
[03:20:40.580 --> 03:20:41.760]  to the Shadow Alliance.
[03:20:41.980 --> 03:20:42.620]  That's true.
[03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:46.080]  I'm not questioning your loyalty, but
[03:20:46.080 --> 03:20:46.800]  you know,
[03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:48.980]  Mario Party has a way.
[03:20:52.720 --> 03:20:54.240]  Avoided the exclamation mark.
[03:20:54.240 --> 03:20:56.040]  As long as you don't get a 1 next time, you're fine.
[03:20:56.660 --> 03:20:56.800]  Yep.
[03:20:57.360 --> 03:20:59.660]  And there's no way you'll get a 1.
[03:20:59.780 --> 03:21:02.080]  0% chance that you'll roll a 1
[03:21:02.080 --> 03:21:03.580]  tomorrow and lose out like I did.
[03:21:04.060 --> 03:21:04.940]  Well, I'm dead.
[03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:07.140]  There's no way
[03:21:07.140 --> 03:21:08.380]  I don't roll a 1 tomorrow.
[03:21:08.580 --> 03:21:09.680]  Where the god damn am I?
[03:21:11.640 --> 03:21:13.220]  You're coming up on the danger zone, Gavin.
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:14.940]  I'll be on the racetrack, idiot.
[03:21:16.400 --> 03:21:16.980]  You're in a
[03:21:16.980 --> 03:21:17.960]  blue space, dummy.
[03:21:18.820 --> 03:21:20.740]  This is such a dangerous area.
[03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:22.300]  It's terrifying, and you're
[03:21:22.900 --> 03:21:24.200]  calling it the danger zone.
[03:21:26.200 --> 03:21:27.000]  More danger!
[03:21:27.960 --> 03:21:28.300]  Wow.
[03:21:29.880 --> 03:21:30.280]  Dangerous.
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:33.280]  I still don't know what happens to these when they flip over.
[03:21:33.280 --> 03:21:34.500]  I guess we'll find out.
[03:21:35.260 --> 03:21:37.580]  Yeah, but if they still land on him, it still counts, right?
[03:21:37.920 --> 03:21:38.800]  We'll find out.
[03:21:40.140 --> 03:21:40.680]  That's the
[03:21:41.180 --> 03:21:42.980]  question that Gavin has, I think, Nick.
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:46.880]  Tempt fate, Gavin.
[03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:49.200]  For some reason, no matter how many times
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:50.920]  it's asked, none of us are going to know the answer.
[03:21:51.300 --> 03:21:52.300]  Nope, until it happens.
[03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:53.360]  Yep.
[03:21:54.620 --> 03:21:55.700]  Now we're talking.
[03:21:55.980 --> 03:21:59.340]  I think that's about to go away.
[03:21:59.780 --> 03:22:00.040]  Yeah.
[03:22:00.040 --> 03:22:01.880]  A guy like me wouldn't
[03:22:01.880 --> 03:22:02.700]  have put it there.
[03:22:03.460 --> 03:22:05.040]  Even though I did it last turn.
[03:22:05.640 --> 03:22:06.700]  Is that really what happens, Nick?
[03:22:06.940 --> 03:22:09.440]  We don't fucking know.
[03:22:09.860 --> 03:22:10.560]  We have no idea.
[03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:12.060]  I know you don't know, Eric.
[03:22:13.060 --> 03:22:14.960]  Why the fuck would Nick know?
[03:22:15.400 --> 03:22:17.100]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[03:22:17.440 --> 03:22:17.920]  He could know.
[03:22:18.340 --> 03:22:20.080]  Could be sneaky.
[03:22:20.980 --> 03:22:22.160]  Oh, interesting.
[03:22:23.240 --> 03:22:26.300]  I'm pretty low on the old items here.
[03:22:26.380 --> 03:22:27.860]  That is true. Nick does like to hold on
[03:22:27.860 --> 03:22:29.740]  to video game information, like the fact that he
[03:22:29.740 --> 03:22:31.700]  could save at any time in Last of Us 2.
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:32.960]  That's true.
[03:22:34.100 --> 03:22:34.900]  That's a good point.
[03:22:35.340 --> 03:22:37.740]  Gavin's a known video game information gatekeeper.
[03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:39.440]  So maybe Gavin knows.
[03:22:39.700 --> 03:22:41.360]  I'm just a knowledge haver.
[03:22:41.700 --> 03:22:43.780]  Yeah, nobody thought to ask Gavin the correct
[03:22:43.780 --> 03:22:45.800]  question in a specific way so he doesn't have
[03:22:45.800 --> 03:22:46.440]  to answer it.
[03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:49.840]  This board looks
[03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:50.800]  insane.
[03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:52.960]  But how would he know what we don't know, guys?
[03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:55.860]  That's definitely not six.
[03:22:56.780 --> 03:22:57.760]  And I missed!
[03:22:58.540 --> 03:23:00.100]  God dammit, I missed the star!
[03:23:00.320 --> 03:23:01.020]  And I missed...
[03:23:01.400 --> 03:23:02.880]  Oh no, you might be landing on Gavin's.
[03:23:02.980 --> 03:23:04.700]  I don't think that's where he put it, is it?
[03:23:04.820 --> 03:23:06.900]  I think he's in the safe one.
[03:23:07.760 --> 03:23:08.760]  He's in the safe one.
[03:23:09.780 --> 03:23:11.840]  If he would have put it on that space
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:13.260]  that he was on, yeah, that would have been it.
[03:23:13.280 --> 03:23:16.300]  I don't think so, though, because he didn't get the three coins as if he landed on that space.
[03:23:16.360 --> 03:23:17.280]  Oh, I guess so.
[03:23:17.340 --> 03:23:18.440]  He just got the green space.
[03:23:19.720 --> 03:23:20.360]  Unbelievable. Crazy.
[03:23:21.460 --> 03:23:23.220]  Alright, mole men, let's do it!
[03:23:23.220 --> 03:23:24.860]  I missed out on two stars.
[03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:27.360]  And...
[03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:28.120]  money!
[03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:30.380]  Oh, big roll.
[03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:32.520]  Shit.
[03:23:33.080 --> 03:23:33.560]  Oh!
[03:23:35.020 --> 03:23:35.980]  Oh, that's good.
[03:23:36.760 --> 03:23:37.680]  Overall, not bad.
[03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:39.800]  Gavin can't believe it.
[03:23:41.900 --> 03:23:43.060]  Fill up her tank.
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:48.640]  Gimme shit.
[03:23:50.240 --> 03:23:51.040]  One Mississippi.
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:51.760]  Not bad.
[03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:53.220]  Mississippi.
[03:23:55.040 --> 03:23:56.140]  Got that double dice.
[03:23:57.620 --> 03:23:58.360]  Jesus Christ.
[03:23:58.940 --> 03:24:00.380]  Alright, alright.
[03:24:00.580 --> 03:24:02.540]  That maybe wasn't great, but it's good.
[03:24:03.400 --> 03:24:04.460]  A double dice is good.
[03:24:04.600 --> 03:24:06.360]  Three double dices is maybe not great.
[03:24:06.960 --> 03:24:09.180]  But, now you know, if you buy some more stuff,
[03:24:09.260 --> 03:24:10.740]  you'll definitely know what to drop.
[03:24:11.060 --> 03:24:11.940]  Alright, what would you like to buy?
[03:24:12.120 --> 03:24:14.100]  Also, I don't have to think about...
[03:24:14.100 --> 03:24:14.600]  Oh no!
[03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:18.440]  You might want to save your buddy.
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:20.900]  Geoff, you might want to hang on to that cash, bud.
[03:24:21.440 --> 03:24:21.640]  Yeah.
[03:24:22.840 --> 03:24:23.200]  Okay.
[03:24:26.800 --> 03:24:28.720]  It's actually the opposite. You should've spent the cash.
[03:24:28.740 --> 03:24:30.560]  Yeah, it seems like I should've spent it instead of giving it.
[03:24:30.600 --> 03:24:32.860]  I don't think so, because you would've had so much.
[03:24:32.980 --> 03:24:35.220]  Like, you are close to a star.
[03:24:35.380 --> 03:24:37.680]  You need as many coins as you can get.
[03:24:38.100 --> 03:24:38.920]  Oh, but look, it's lucky.
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:39.400]  It gets more money.
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:40.920]  Hey, there you go.
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:45.240]  Oh my God!
[03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:47.920]  I think if you count it,
[03:24:47.980 --> 03:24:49.600]  there's like six of these on the floor right here.
[03:24:49.900 --> 03:24:51.420]  Now, that could be really effective.
[03:24:52.060 --> 03:24:52.540]  That's...
[03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:53.500]  He ditched it.
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:24:56.060]  I was with you, Andrew.
[03:24:56.340 --> 03:24:59.220]  I honestly thought, well, you could slow someone's roll.
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:00.820]  It's the slow,
[03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:02.460]  putting them in the danger zone.
[03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:06.760]  Twist and sort.
[03:25:07.340 --> 03:25:08.620]  Oh, it's too early to sort.
[03:25:08.680 --> 03:25:09.680]  Twist and sort, baby.
[03:25:10.020 --> 03:25:13.620]  I can twist, but I can't sort.
[03:25:13.620 --> 03:25:14.480]  Twist and sort.
[03:25:15.560 --> 03:25:17.280]  What time do you gain sorting?
[03:25:18.060 --> 03:25:18.220]  Oh, shit.
[03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:20.540]  I've never played this one.
[03:25:21.220 --> 03:25:22.080]  I like this one.
[03:25:22.780 --> 03:25:24.020]  That means I'm gonna lose.
[03:25:25.240 --> 03:25:26.880]  Oh, I see.
[03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:28.640]  Just put it in the box.
[03:25:30.020 --> 03:25:31.900]  Put it in the associated box.
[03:25:32.300 --> 03:25:32.460]  Yep.
[03:25:32.840 --> 03:25:33.540]  I can do that.
[03:25:34.960 --> 03:25:36.020]  We'll see about that.
[03:25:36.500 --> 03:25:37.880]  What are we getting?
[03:25:38.480 --> 03:25:39.780]  Oh, I couldn't make my mind up.
[03:25:39.780 --> 03:25:40.120]  Jesus.
[03:25:41.380 --> 03:25:42.520]  Same exact boat.
[03:25:47.430 --> 03:25:48.870]  You guys are locked in.
[03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:50.350]  Oh, yeah.
[03:25:50.430 --> 03:25:51.090]  Should we be talking?
[03:25:51.470 --> 03:25:53.470]  There's no shit talk. It is just a lock.
[03:25:53.570 --> 03:25:54.550]  There's a lock right now.
[03:25:54.790 --> 03:25:56.950]  There you go, Dilkong blowing it.
[03:25:58.130 --> 03:25:59.570]  I was thinking too far ahead there,
[03:25:59.650 --> 03:26:01.750]  and I lost two. That sucked.
[03:26:02.910 --> 03:26:04.170]  They're coming in too hot.
[03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:05.930]  You want them pretty hot.
[03:26:06.250 --> 03:26:08.410]  Nick is crushing the game right now.
[03:26:08.610 --> 03:26:10.610]  Oh, but there's Dilkong with the comeback.
[03:26:10.610 --> 03:26:13.530]  Oh, indecisive move from Nick.
[03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:15.210]  Dilkong might have this one.
[03:26:15.550 --> 03:26:16.690]  It's Dilkong's to lose.
[03:26:17.210 --> 03:26:18.050]  Tied up.
[03:26:18.530 --> 03:26:19.690]  Four seconds left.
[03:26:21.010 --> 03:26:21.770]  Fifteen.
[03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:23.450]  Oh!
[03:26:23.810 --> 03:26:25.070]  He stole it!
[03:26:25.370 --> 03:26:25.810]  Wow.
[03:26:27.810 --> 03:26:28.870]  Dilkong stole it.
[03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:32.350]  Dilkong stole it.
[03:26:32.930 --> 03:26:33.410]  Damn.
[03:26:35.730 --> 03:26:36.490]  Dilkong.
[03:26:36.630 --> 03:26:38.690]  That was the theft of the century.
[03:26:39.330 --> 03:26:40.850]  Well played, Dilkong.
[03:26:41.290 --> 03:26:43.450]  That's the only thing I've done well in the last ten turns.
[03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.670]  You weren't playing.
[03:26:45.050 --> 03:26:45.930]  Great play.
[03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:48.470]  Great move.
[03:26:50.350 --> 03:26:50.790]  Alright.
[03:26:52.010 --> 03:26:52.450]  Wow.
[03:26:53.630 --> 03:26:54.690]  Let's take a look at the board.
[03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:57.550]  We are so close to getting done.
[03:26:57.690 --> 03:26:58.170]  Under a week.
[03:26:58.290 --> 03:26:59.530]  But it won't be her.
[03:27:00.570 --> 03:27:03.490]  It'll be someone else, but we do know there's a temporary buddy coming.
[03:27:03.730 --> 03:27:04.770]  Gavin's real close to her.
[03:27:04.910 --> 03:27:06.850]  Yeah, but she'll be somewhere else.
[03:27:07.970 --> 03:27:10.730]  I think it seems to return to the same place.
[03:27:10.830 --> 03:27:11.230]  Does it not?
[03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:13.170]  Just a different person.
[03:27:13.370 --> 03:27:13.470]  What?
[03:27:14.110 --> 03:27:15.050]  I guess we'll see.
[03:27:15.870 --> 03:27:19.130]  Of all the people, Gavin does not need.
[03:27:19.690 --> 03:27:21.590]  Well, he might have the advantage to go.
[03:27:22.310 --> 03:27:23.070]  That's true.
[03:27:23.250 --> 03:27:23.950]  He could blow it.
[03:27:24.690 --> 03:27:28.090]  Let's see. I've got six until I have an opportunity for a star.
[03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:28.790]  Hell yeah, Nick.
[03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:30.950]  Andrew is in extreme danger here.
[03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.270]  Hell no.
[03:27:31.710 --> 03:27:34.670]  If he rolls a one, he'll get a star.
[03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:38.150]  I'm three away from that space where I could steal someone's stars.
[03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:39.550]  Oh, you don't have any stars.
[03:27:39.550 --> 03:27:40.990]  Oh, you don't have any stars, so you won't be giving anything.
[03:27:40.990 --> 03:27:42.430]  No, no, no, but I can do the challenge.
[03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:45.210]  The event space or whatever where I can do a star steal.
[03:27:45.970 --> 03:27:47.110]  Yeah, you're four away from that.
[03:27:47.210 --> 03:27:47.390]  Okay.
[03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:49.910]  You're five and six away from Bowser.
[03:27:50.770 --> 03:27:51.090]  Sweet.
[03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:53.230]  You're in a real pickle.
[03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:58.330]  Meanwhile, Gavin is temporarily five away from Rosalina.
[03:27:59.170 --> 03:28:00.570]  And then, Geoff?
[03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:01.410]  That's me.
[03:28:03.130 --> 03:28:03.850]  You're a...
[03:28:03.850 --> 03:28:07.130]  If you roll a three or a four, you'll be giving me a star.
[03:28:08.470 --> 03:28:08.610]  Oh.
[03:28:09.070 --> 03:28:10.070]  No, I don't want to do that.
[03:28:11.090 --> 03:28:12.650]  And if you...
[03:28:12.650 --> 03:28:15.170]  Well, you'll have to make a decision about which way to go, I guess.
[03:28:15.330 --> 03:28:15.650]  Okay.
[03:28:15.830 --> 03:28:16.770]  That's all coming up next time.
[03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:18.950]  I'll probably base that decision on all of y'all's turns.
[03:28:19.870 --> 03:28:20.130]  Nick.
[03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:21.070]  Yes?
[03:28:21.170 --> 03:28:23.990]  Is there any filth between you and the star that could stop you getting it?
[03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:25.230]  Yes.
[03:28:26.310 --> 03:28:30.870]  Well, if I roll a four...
[03:28:30.870 --> 03:28:32.050]  I thought you were one away from green.
[03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:35.370]  That is a green, but it's a roulette block.
[03:28:36.710 --> 03:28:38.230]  Four is the event space.
[03:28:38.390 --> 03:28:38.590]  Oh.
[03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:42.410]  So, as long as I don't roll a four...
[03:28:42.410 --> 03:28:44.110]  If you have a four, bad luck.
[03:28:44.370 --> 03:28:44.550]  Yep.
[03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:45.810]  And you have no help, right?
[03:28:45.870 --> 03:28:47.730]  You have no items that are going to get you over there.
[03:28:48.350 --> 03:28:49.150]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:28:49.290 --> 03:28:49.690]  Wow.
[03:28:51.910 --> 03:28:53.170]  Let's say my name in this.
[03:28:53.170 --> 03:28:53.950]  What did I do?
[03:28:54.490 --> 03:28:55.290]  I mean, you could have.
[03:28:56.370 --> 03:29:01.050]  Well, Nick is going to try to get a star on a raw roll tomorrow.
[03:29:01.290 --> 03:29:02.970]  Join us. It'll be turn 24.
[03:29:03.370 --> 03:29:03.910]  Raw roll.
[03:29:04.210 --> 03:29:06.190]  Raw roll tomorrow.
[03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:09.850]  Then he's going to go water his trees.
[03:29:10.230 --> 03:29:11.310]  So, really exciting stuff, guys.
[03:29:11.570 --> 03:29:13.070]  Thank you for joining us. We'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
[03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:15.910]  Eight minutes per tree today.
[03:29:18.470 --> 03:29:21.930]  Right as we were sinking, the coffee just fucking attacked my asshole.
[03:29:21.930 --> 03:29:25.430]  The coffee usually hits me right in the middle of my turn when I'm looking at the map.
[03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:27.970]  Maybe that's why he's so slow, Andrew.
[03:29:28.170 --> 03:29:29.090]  I think it might be.
[03:29:29.230 --> 03:29:29.970]  What was I slow about?
[03:29:30.310 --> 03:29:35.110]  I was watching some of the turns and you take the longest by far.
[03:29:35.250 --> 03:29:35.810]  You take your time.
[03:29:36.010 --> 03:29:37.210]  And I haven't noticed it.
[03:29:37.330 --> 03:29:39.590]  I didn't notice it until I watched it.
[03:29:39.790 --> 03:29:42.650]  Gavin, I want you to take all the time you need, man.
[03:29:42.890 --> 03:29:43.850]  Yeah, I had no issue.
[03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:45.610]  It's just you are a slow player.
[03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:48.490]  I want the finished version to be five hours long.
[03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:49.470]  We're getting there.
[03:29:49.470 --> 03:29:52.490]  What about the Norwegian version?
[03:29:53.390 --> 03:29:54.270]  Turn 24!
[03:29:58.130 --> 03:29:59.270]  She's in a different spot!
[03:29:59.850 --> 03:30:01.510]  Why is she in a different spot? Isn't that crazy?
[03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.510]  Insane.
[03:30:02.530 --> 03:30:04.970]  I didn't think she moved. I thought it was just the character change.
[03:30:05.610 --> 03:30:06.950]  Oh no. Fuck off, Gavin.
[03:30:06.970 --> 03:30:08.070]  Oh my god.
[03:30:09.430 --> 03:30:11.350]  We have to stop Gavin at all costs.
[03:30:11.350 --> 03:30:13.010]  Oh, and it's on the way to the star.
[03:30:13.430 --> 03:30:15.330]  Of course it is. Why wouldn't it have been that way?
[03:30:15.330 --> 03:30:16.530]  I'm not remotely a threat.
[03:30:16.530 --> 03:30:18.610]  I just landed on a chance time. The whole game is over.
[03:30:20.610 --> 03:30:23.310]  I just have to not roll a four.
[03:30:23.410 --> 03:30:23.910]  Good luck, Mario.
[03:30:24.510 --> 03:30:25.910]  Oh, you got it.
[03:30:25.930 --> 03:30:27.210]  You got exactly what you needed.
[03:30:27.610 --> 03:30:29.230]  Oh my god, that never happens.
[03:30:29.310 --> 03:30:30.690]  Could this be a turnaround for Nick?
[03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:33.250]  This is it. I told them before the game started,
[03:30:33.370 --> 03:30:35.390]  Gavin, it's over for you.
[03:30:37.470 --> 03:30:38.670]  He did say it.
[03:30:40.650 --> 03:30:42.130]  It's anyone's game still.
[03:30:42.550 --> 03:30:43.110]  You wouldn't think it.
[03:30:43.110 --> 03:30:44.010]  You had five stars.
[03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:45.330]  Easy to say when you have five stars.
[03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:48.910]  Everyone goes by Boo constantly in this game.
[03:30:50.250 --> 03:30:52.290]  The economy is great for everyone, he said.
[03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:58.730]  On a nice little blue space for you.
[03:31:00.690 --> 03:31:04.770]  Gavin was telling me earlier that he thinks stars are just social security Ponzi schemes.
[03:31:07.110 --> 03:31:09.430]  And I was like, but you're the richest star man in the world.
[03:31:09.530 --> 03:31:10.150]  How would you know?
[03:31:11.110 --> 03:31:12.330]  Why check the...
[03:31:12.330 --> 03:31:13.750]  You're going one way.
[03:31:13.930 --> 03:31:16.190]  There's no other path you can go.
[03:31:17.330 --> 03:31:17.890]  Roll a one!
[03:31:18.090 --> 03:31:18.530]  Roll a one!
[03:31:20.090 --> 03:31:20.970]  One! Two!
[03:31:22.090 --> 03:31:22.690]  Alright, I'll take it.
[03:31:24.250 --> 03:31:26.710]  I was just seeing how many I needed to hit the store.
[03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:28.150]  You fill up on some...
[03:31:29.370 --> 03:31:30.130]  some bullshit.
[03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:33.290]  I like Sunday, Nick.
[03:31:33.890 --> 03:31:35.350]  Double dice blocks, let's see.
[03:31:35.830 --> 03:31:36.990]  Let's see if he gets something cool.
[03:31:36.990 --> 03:31:38.050]  Jack me up.
[03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.730]  Double dice.
[03:31:39.810 --> 03:31:42.550]  Nick came in on cloud nine this morning because of my rain today.
[03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:44.210]  So he doesn't have to water his trees.
[03:31:44.490 --> 03:31:44.870]  Nice.
[03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:47.690]  A lot of dice.
[03:31:48.930 --> 03:31:49.550]  That's pretty good.
[03:31:50.190 --> 03:31:52.630]  That custom one I think is going to pay dividends.
[03:31:52.990 --> 03:31:53.410]  It's a good one.
[03:31:54.250 --> 03:31:56.310]  And then on Thursday, Friday, it'll drown the tree.
[03:31:56.570 --> 03:31:56.890]  That's true.
[03:31:57.870 --> 03:32:00.050]  He's got to actually go out and pump out water on Thursday.
[03:32:01.150 --> 03:32:02.690]  He's going to ask his wife to do it.
[03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:03.970]  She's actually busy.
[03:32:03.970 --> 03:32:06.350]  She has meetings.
[03:32:07.430 --> 03:32:08.730]  Where am I going?
[03:32:09.350 --> 03:32:09.890]  Oh no.
[03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.830]  Go right.
[03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:14.170]  Go right.
[03:32:15.250 --> 03:32:16.130]  I'm sorry.
[03:32:17.710 --> 03:32:18.470]  Pretty good.
[03:32:18.610 --> 03:32:19.670]  I respect the decision.
[03:32:20.210 --> 03:32:20.450]  Hello.
[03:32:23.830 --> 03:32:25.970]  What's it going to be, mole man?
[03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:28.270]  When you said that, I thought Emily walked in your office.
[03:32:28.730 --> 03:32:30.510]  No, I was just saying hello to Monty Mole.
[03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.510]  13.
[03:32:31.510 --> 03:32:33.810]  It's going to be a two star game.
[03:32:34.290 --> 03:32:34.890]  Two star ten.
[03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:37.050]  Oh boy, here we go.
[03:32:38.510 --> 03:32:39.050]  Geoff!
[03:32:40.030 --> 03:32:41.110]  Good one.
[03:32:41.490 --> 03:32:42.310]  Six or better.
[03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:43.330]  Wow.
[03:32:44.490 --> 03:32:45.530]  Two star turn.
[03:32:47.430 --> 03:32:47.550]  Alright.
[03:32:48.730 --> 03:32:50.050]  Don't pick the wrong path.
[03:32:50.890 --> 03:32:51.770]  Hold on a second.
[03:32:52.470 --> 03:32:56.650]  If I go this way, it's 58 turns to the star.
[03:32:57.090 --> 03:32:58.510]  Tempt fate like Nick does.
[03:32:58.610 --> 03:32:59.170]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:32:59.670 --> 03:33:00.670]  But if I go this way,
[03:33:00.770 --> 03:33:03.110]  it's significantly less stars.
[03:33:03.530 --> 03:33:05.070]  If you hit B, it doesn't help.
[03:33:05.530 --> 03:33:06.990]  Yeah, I would go the nine way.
[03:33:07.450 --> 03:33:08.430]  I have nine left.
[03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:10.770]  If I go to the right, I'm going to get a star.
[03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:12.150]  If I go to the left, I wouldn't.
[03:33:12.470 --> 03:33:13.610]  Yeah, go to the right.
[03:33:14.690 --> 03:33:17.250]  Gavin said it's anyone's game, so you could have gone to the top one.
[03:33:17.490 --> 03:33:18.090]  It's up to you.
[03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:20.770]  Then I'm going to buy this.
[03:33:22.310 --> 03:33:23.310]  That'll help recover
[03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:25.770]  the star that I lost to Gavin.
[03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:27.570]  I do agree that it is
[03:33:27.570 --> 03:33:29.850]  anyone's game because you guys are both coming up on
[03:33:29.850 --> 03:33:31.550]  the boo area.
[03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:34.690]  And then a bunch of star steals.
[03:33:36.070 --> 03:33:37.870]  It's getting dangerous with the amount of
[03:33:37.870 --> 03:33:39.510]  star steals that are placed around this board.
[03:33:40.590 --> 03:33:41.470]  Oh, that's true.
[03:33:42.470 --> 03:33:43.350]  That is very true.
[03:33:44.470 --> 03:33:46.510]  You know it's going to happen on turn 29 also.
[03:33:47.410 --> 03:33:49.910]  Let's just say, theoretically, Gavin got
[03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:51.930]  Peach and landed on one of our
[03:33:51.930 --> 03:33:53.610]  give a star over spaces
[03:33:53.610 --> 03:33:55.950]  with Peach in tow. Does that mean two stars?
[03:33:55.950 --> 03:33:56.730]  Yeah.
[03:33:56.810 --> 03:33:58.830]  I would hope it's the single-use trap.
[03:33:59.890 --> 03:34:01.350]  I mean, a single-use trap
[03:34:01.890 --> 03:34:03.950]  is a single-use space is double applied.
[03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:05.130]  Is that how you spell pickaxes?
[03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:06.070]  Is there no E at the end?
[03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.950]  Oh, I don't know.
[03:34:09.730 --> 03:34:10.530]  Vertical bollocks.
[03:34:13.650 --> 03:34:14.050]  Hold?
[03:34:15.510 --> 03:34:16.950]  I have to hold one of them?
[03:34:17.450 --> 03:34:18.110]  Or both.
[03:34:19.770 --> 03:34:21.010]  Why is it not going?
[03:34:21.090 --> 03:34:23.890]  Either way, Geoff's the best at this.
[03:34:24.490 --> 03:34:25.490]  Hold on, I'm not moving.
[03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:27.690]  I'm jacking off constantly.
[03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:32.070]  What do you think I was doing before we got in here?
[03:34:32.390 --> 03:34:33.130]  What do you think I'm doing right now?
[03:34:34.470 --> 03:34:35.730]  It's like God gave us two hands.
[03:34:35.850 --> 03:34:37.050]  No shirt pickaxing.
[03:34:37.330 --> 03:34:38.870]  A video game hand or a dick hand?
[03:34:40.310 --> 03:34:41.370]  Oh, come on, boys. Dig.
[03:34:42.010 --> 03:34:43.990]  You gotta go. Go for gold. Keep going.
[03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:46.250]  Why is it not vibrating for me anymore?
[03:34:46.250 --> 03:34:46.970]  Oh, there goes the mole.
[03:34:47.590 --> 03:34:48.770]  Why the fuck should it stop?
[03:34:49.530 --> 03:34:52.450]  How y'all gonna try to out-dig a mole?
[03:34:52.450 --> 03:34:55.270]  Seriously, it's what we do.
[03:34:55.350 --> 03:34:56.650]  That's a great point.
[03:34:56.970 --> 03:34:58.050]  I don't know why we would try.
[03:34:58.510 --> 03:35:00.170]  Yeah, I shouldn't have put the controller down.
[03:35:00.990 --> 03:35:01.970]  Nick, what happened?
[03:35:02.710 --> 03:35:03.710]  My controller shut off.
[03:35:04.510 --> 03:35:07.150]  You should charge the controller.
[03:35:07.390 --> 03:35:07.950]  It shut off?
[03:35:08.050 --> 03:35:11.170]  No, it's fully charged. I pulled it off the charger this morning.
[03:35:11.850 --> 03:35:12.330]  Disconnected.
[03:35:12.430 --> 03:35:13.230]  Two coins.
[03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:14.190]  Excellent.
[03:35:17.390 --> 03:35:18.970]  On the footage it says the
[03:35:18.970 --> 03:35:20.630]  controller turned off in the middle of that.
[03:35:21.170 --> 03:35:22.130]  No, it turned it off
[03:35:22.130 --> 03:35:23.790]  as it was giving us the results.
[03:35:25.690 --> 03:35:26.870]  Anyway, let's look at the board.
[03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:28.690]  Hold on, Gavin.
[03:35:28.830 --> 03:35:29.330]  Hold on.
[03:35:30.750 --> 03:35:30.970]  Sorry.
[03:35:33.750 --> 03:35:34.070]  God.
[03:35:36.010 --> 03:35:36.330]  Well,
[03:35:36.910 --> 03:35:38.970]  Gavin has 29 to get to the star,
[03:35:39.050 --> 03:35:40.790]  but he's got a few items on his side
[03:35:40.790 --> 03:35:42.990]  and he could cross Princess Peach,
[03:35:43.010 --> 03:35:44.590]  which will start an event for all of us.
[03:35:44.710 --> 03:35:46.230]  Geoff and I are coming into the danger zone
[03:35:46.230 --> 03:35:48.350]  with a bunch of stars to give up, but
[03:35:48.350 --> 03:35:50.110]  we got Boo on the horizon,
[03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:52.590]  Dilkong, also neck-and-neck
[03:35:52.590 --> 03:35:54.730]  with Gavin, so we're going to see how that plays out.
[03:35:54.910 --> 03:35:56.150]  He's not getting any items, though.
[03:35:56.370 --> 03:35:58.550]  Yeah, I don't have the items to pass him. It's going to be tough.
[03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:01.210]  But I believe in you.
[03:36:01.870 --> 03:36:03.370]  Good. I need somebody to.
[03:36:05.130 --> 03:36:06.490]  Listen, it's all against Gavin.
[03:36:06.770 --> 03:36:08.790]  It's a lot of silence outside of Nick.
[03:36:09.270 --> 03:36:10.030]  That's a lot of Dillionaires.
[03:36:10.730 --> 03:36:12.070]  Yeah, I mean, Dillionaires,
[03:36:12.190 --> 03:36:14.030]  we're doing well, but we need
[03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:15.270]  things to flip soon.
[03:36:15.270 --> 03:36:17.130]  I read that early accounts are
[03:36:17.130 --> 03:36:18.490]  there might be as many as a Dillion.
[03:36:19.530 --> 03:36:20.010]  Wow!
[03:36:21.390 --> 03:36:23.270]  There's also quite a lot of Wari-Ho's.
[03:36:24.170 --> 03:36:25.350]  I can't wait to rug-pull
[03:36:25.350 --> 03:36:26.090]  on the Dillionaires.
[03:36:27.130 --> 03:36:28.350]  Not like that at all.
[03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:31.550]  Well, if you're
[03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:33.370]  a Wari-Ho or
[03:36:33.370 --> 03:36:35.110]  a Dillionaire, join us tomorrow
[03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:37.210]  as we get deeper into this game of
[03:36:37.210 --> 03:36:39.330]  Mario Party. We'll see you next time.
[03:36:39.470 --> 03:36:41.410]  Bye! I'd never rug-pull
[03:36:41.410 --> 03:36:42.170]  on the Dillionaires.
[03:36:42.170 --> 03:36:44.250]  I would. No hesitation.
[03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:48.270]  25.
[03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:50.170]  Oh, I forgot about Peach.
[03:36:50.430 --> 03:36:52.170]  Yeah, Peach is out there. Someone has to do
[03:36:52.170 --> 03:36:54.250]  something. Someone has to do
[03:36:54.250 --> 03:36:55.330]  something somewhere.
[03:36:55.650 --> 03:36:58.190]  Someone has to do something.
[03:36:58.950 --> 03:36:59.430]  Bullballs.
[03:36:59.730 --> 03:37:02.110]  I think I landed on an event
[03:37:02.110 --> 03:37:03.370]  space. Damn it!
[03:37:03.930 --> 03:37:04.570]  No!
[03:37:06.450 --> 03:37:07.890]  You, uh...
[03:37:07.890 --> 03:37:10.210]  I think you got screwed
[03:37:10.210 --> 03:37:11.850]  there, bud. Yeah.
[03:37:12.090 --> 03:37:13.230]  Well, the game's over.
[03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:15.470]  Why did you say god damn it?
[03:37:16.210 --> 03:37:18.190]  Uh, cause you need to
[03:37:18.190 --> 03:37:20.250]  lose stars. You do need to lose
[03:37:20.250 --> 03:37:21.950]  stars at any means necessary.
[03:37:22.490 --> 03:37:23.950]  I spent all of yesterday
[03:37:23.950 --> 03:37:26.210]  texting Andrew telling him he should steal Nick's
[03:37:26.210 --> 03:37:26.450]  stars.
[03:37:29.730 --> 03:37:32.150]  I'm not even gonna reach Boo unless I
[03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:34.110]  roll like 41 out of my
[03:37:34.110 --> 03:37:35.250]  next five turns.
[03:37:35.930 --> 03:37:38.190]  Gavin, what are you looking at?
[03:37:38.190 --> 03:37:40.350]  The old board. Yeah, it's a straight
[03:37:40.350 --> 03:37:42.670]  shot, but he's gonna evaluate. He's gonna see what's...
[03:37:42.670 --> 03:37:44.290]  I'm gonna see how many I can custom
[03:37:44.290 --> 03:37:45.850]  block. Are you going to custom block?
[03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:48.190]  I'm not gonna make it, so I'm gonna double block to try
[03:37:48.190 --> 03:37:50.310]  to get Peach. He can't... The problem with Gavin
[03:37:50.310 --> 03:37:52.370]  is he can't count on his fingers and hold a controller
[03:37:52.370 --> 03:37:53.150]  at the same time.
[03:37:55.330 --> 03:37:56.210]  Well, I also didn't know
[03:37:56.210 --> 03:37:58.090]  how many away from Peach I was. That's why you gotta
[03:37:58.090 --> 03:37:58.350]  count.
[03:38:00.770 --> 03:38:02.210]  Low roll. Whoops.
[03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:03.970]  Low roll. Come on now.
[03:38:04.590 --> 03:38:05.830]  Low roll. Alright!
[03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:08.230]  Only 20 to go.
[03:38:09.250 --> 03:38:09.850]  Oh, landed
[03:38:09.850 --> 03:38:11.350]  something bad. Damn.
[03:38:12.010 --> 03:38:12.830]  Oh, it's a green.
[03:38:14.190 --> 03:38:15.970]  Great, he replaces the thing he lost.
[03:38:16.210 --> 03:38:17.690]  Oh, nice. Let's get richer.
[03:38:18.410 --> 03:38:18.630]  Yeah.
[03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:22.710]  Wanna buy stock?
[03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:28.050]  Gavin is definitely the Elon Musk of this
[03:38:28.050 --> 03:38:29.850]  gameplay. Many people
[03:38:29.850 --> 03:38:31.870]  are saying that. Many people are saying it.
[03:38:32.050 --> 03:38:32.330]  Yeah.
[03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:35.750]  Well, that was disappointing.
[03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:37.750]  That was a quick move and turn.
[03:38:38.430 --> 03:38:39.790]  This is a really fast turn.
[03:38:40.090 --> 03:38:40.910]  We're flying.
[03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:43.830]  Alright, let's see.
[03:38:44.490 --> 03:38:46.790]  No, no, no.
[03:38:47.970 --> 03:38:48.510]  No, no, no.
[03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.850]  No, stop, Geoff!
[03:38:50.310 --> 03:38:51.890]  What are you doing?
[03:38:52.090 --> 03:38:54.050]  Geoff, please! If you had Nick, he would have
[03:38:54.050 --> 03:38:55.310]  chucked two phones out of the car.
[03:38:58.370 --> 03:38:58.630]  Yep.
[03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:59.990]  Just like Nick.
[03:39:01.350 --> 03:39:04.510]  I could be using one of those items right now.
[03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:05.390]  Oh!
[03:39:06.270 --> 03:39:08.090]  Oh, no.
[03:39:08.770 --> 03:39:09.290]  Pretty good.
[03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:11.550]  I have a bad feeling.
[03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:14.050]  He doesn't have the money.
[03:39:15.430 --> 03:39:16.290]  Steal it from Gavin.
[03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:18.730]  Don't do...
[03:39:18.730 --> 03:39:19.030]  No!
[03:39:20.770 --> 03:39:21.330]  Why?
[03:39:22.170 --> 03:39:24.330]  Why? What do you mean, why?
[03:39:24.450 --> 03:39:25.630]  Chance did it, not me.
[03:39:25.630 --> 03:39:27.750]  No, you're full of shit.
[03:39:27.770 --> 03:39:28.770]  You're making that choice.
[03:39:29.130 --> 03:39:31.750]  At this point, Geoff, you're making a random choice
[03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:33.330]  when you could be making an intentional one.
[03:39:33.350 --> 03:39:34.250]  Oh, I'm not hitting the button!
[03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:36.390]  Why aren't you...
[03:39:36.390 --> 03:39:37.870]  I accidentally closed.
[03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:40.310]  Wait!
[03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:42.630]  Andrew just turned off his controller.
[03:39:43.050 --> 03:39:44.130]  He turned off his game.
[03:39:45.510 --> 03:39:47.230]  He disconnected, it says.
[03:39:47.250 --> 03:39:50.110]  He just put his console into sleep.
[03:39:51.410 --> 03:39:53.870]  I think the turn might not be
[03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:54.850]  canon anymore.
[03:39:55.930 --> 03:39:58.210]  Remember how we said this was a fast turn?
[03:39:59.950 --> 03:40:02.150]  We can't take this kind of time tomorrow, guys.
[03:40:02.310 --> 03:40:03.070]  I gotta catch a plane.
[03:40:05.330 --> 03:40:06.370]  How do I...
[03:40:06.370 --> 03:40:06.650]  Uh-huh.
[03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:09.350]  What are you going for?
[03:40:10.050 --> 03:40:11.590]  I gotta join back in.
[03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:13.790]  Yeah, reconnect. Is it gonna happen?
[03:40:14.450 --> 03:40:14.770]  Let's see.
[03:40:15.130 --> 03:40:16.370]  I don't think it's gonna work.
[03:40:17.310 --> 03:40:18.850]  No rooms can be found. What's the code?
[03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:21.450]  I don't know.
[03:40:21.450 --> 03:40:21.670]  Alright.
[03:40:23.810 --> 03:40:26.190]  I'm gonna have to dismiss the fact that you left.
[03:40:26.370 --> 03:40:27.350]  No, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:29.510]  Let me go back in my recording.
[03:40:29.730 --> 03:40:31.370]  I'm not recording, but it's...
[03:40:31.370 --> 03:40:33.290]  And I can see it when I entered it in.
[03:40:33.870 --> 03:40:34.550]  Go back in my recording.
[03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:36.030]  Let me go back for some reason.
[03:40:36.390 --> 03:40:37.830]  Right, because you're recording still.
[03:40:38.090 --> 03:40:40.730]  I think...
[03:40:40.730 --> 03:40:42.210]  Why would Geoff...
[03:40:42.210 --> 03:40:43.110]  I'm not recording.
[03:40:43.490 --> 03:40:45.950]  How did that even happen?
[03:40:46.330 --> 03:40:47.070]  Oh, the game.
[03:40:47.070 --> 03:40:48.410]  Got it, got it, got it.
[03:40:48.470 --> 03:40:53.830]  How did that happen? You weren't hitting any of the buttons, and so you started hitting all of the buttons.
[03:40:54.210 --> 03:40:54.990]  I just don't know.
[03:40:55.250 --> 03:40:57.430]  I mean, I watched it.
[03:40:57.610 --> 03:40:59.210]  Andrew, you were sharing your screen with me.
[03:40:59.430 --> 03:41:00.870]  I watched you hit...
[03:41:01.830 --> 03:41:03.070]  I was just mashing...
[03:41:03.850 --> 03:41:06.530]  Like, I don't understand how...
[03:41:06.530 --> 03:41:06.830]  Yeah.
[03:41:07.350 --> 03:41:10.190]  Like, I know I accidentally hit a button, and then it went there, but...
[03:41:10.190 --> 03:41:11.430]  That's one way to get rid of Boo.
[03:41:11.870 --> 03:41:13.330]  It's one way for me to re-roll.
[03:41:13.810 --> 03:41:15.250]  Are we gonna have to re-do that turn?
[03:41:15.250 --> 03:41:16.190]  We might.
[03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:19.890]  I think we have to. I don't know how else I could join it.
[03:41:20.130 --> 03:41:20.890]  Try joining now.
[03:41:21.850 --> 03:41:22.650]  Yeah, nothing.
[03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:25.250]  Wait, wait, but if every...
[03:41:25.770 --> 03:41:26.890]  Did everyone roll?
[03:41:28.110 --> 03:41:28.430]  Nah.
[03:41:28.730 --> 03:41:31.810]  We did, but we haven't finished the turn because we didn't hit the...
[03:41:31.810 --> 03:41:33.930]  Right, right, we haven't done the mini-game yet, right?
[03:41:34.330 --> 03:41:34.550]  Yep.
[03:41:34.930 --> 03:41:40.990]  I mean, you can watch my screen if you want.
[03:41:42.330 --> 03:41:44.910]  I can, but it's just stuck on the...
[03:41:44.910 --> 03:41:46.750]  If it's not paused...
[03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:47.950]  Oh, let me tell you.
[03:41:48.090 --> 03:41:49.430]  Oh my god.
[03:41:49.450 --> 03:41:52.510]  Yeah, this is not canon, I'm afraid.
[03:41:52.750 --> 03:41:55.350]  I'm afraid that this does not count.
[03:41:55.430 --> 03:41:56.510]  We're gonna have to re-do it.
[03:41:56.570 --> 03:41:57.350]  Better pause it, Gavin.
[03:41:58.050 --> 03:41:58.270]  Pause it.
[03:42:00.410 --> 03:42:02.170]  He can't join if it's paused.
[03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:03.750]  I'm seeing if he can join.
[03:42:04.310 --> 03:42:05.970]  Well, he can't join now.
[03:42:06.970 --> 03:42:07.910]  It's going too fast.
[03:42:08.190 --> 03:42:10.690]  We can't have Andrew not in.
[03:42:11.190 --> 03:42:11.910]  Let's go ahead.
[03:42:12.150 --> 03:42:12.930]  It's about to start.
[03:42:12.930 --> 03:42:13.330]  Nope.
[03:42:13.470 --> 03:42:14.510]  It's definitely not gonna work.
[03:42:15.590 --> 03:42:18.890]  The lack of urgency on Gavin's part is stunning to me.
[03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:21.190]  We should probably cut and re-roll.
[03:42:21.190 --> 03:42:22.850]  We should probably cut and re-roll.
[03:42:23.250 --> 03:42:25.510]  I would love to not miss a mini-game.
[03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:27.930]  We could cut, delete, and then re-roll all together.
[03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.930]  So that it...
[03:42:28.930 --> 03:42:30.710]  We can't have Andrew missing like that.
[03:42:30.990 --> 03:42:32.270]  No, we can't. That's fucked up.
[03:42:32.410 --> 03:42:36.470]  I put a thousand dollars this morning to maintain the integrity of this show.
[03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:37.210]  He really...
[03:42:37.210 --> 03:42:38.830]  You know what? He absolutely did.
[03:42:39.230 --> 03:42:39.610]  He did.
[03:42:39.610 --> 03:42:40.290]  He had to change a flight.
[03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:43.430]  And he has to inconvenience himself for it too.
[03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:44.590]  I'm super sorry about that.
[03:42:45.270 --> 03:42:45.950]  Don't apologize.
[03:42:46.830 --> 03:42:47.730]  Don't apologize.
[03:42:48.810 --> 03:42:51.710]  Fate is a fickle fuckster.
[03:42:52.170 --> 03:42:53.170]  Fate's a fickle fuckster.
[03:42:54.330 --> 03:42:54.950]  As they say.
[03:42:56.310 --> 03:42:57.910]  Alright, so I'm gonna...
[03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:59.110]  Just turn your Xbox off.
[03:42:59.270 --> 03:43:01.390]  Or your Nintendo off.
[03:43:02.170 --> 03:43:03.130]  Jesus Christ.
[03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:06.570]  I'm trying not to lose a fucking star here.
[03:43:06.570 --> 03:43:07.870]  Yeah, no, I saw.
[03:43:08.350 --> 03:43:09.350]  So I'm quitting, yeah?
[03:43:09.810 --> 03:43:12.150]  Yeah, so should we cut or just keep this all?
[03:43:12.210 --> 03:43:13.670]  Oh no, we gotta keep all this.
[03:43:14.010 --> 03:43:15.730]  I don't know why we have to show that...
[03:43:16.190 --> 03:43:19.730]  We have to show that integrity was nearly lost in this game.
[03:43:19.730 --> 03:43:19.970]  Yeah.
[03:43:20.090 --> 03:43:22.450]  I think it's nice to glimpse an alternate timeline.
[03:43:22.990 --> 03:43:24.410]  Yeah, you know what? That is cool.
[03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:25.130]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:27.210]  We really Dr. Strange this one.
[03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:30.630]  I'm so excited to see what the comment leaders are gonna have to say about this.
[03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:32.090]  They're gonna be pissed.
[03:43:33.410 --> 03:43:34.070]  Yeah, Andrew.
[03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:35.150]  Uh, yeah.
[03:43:35.570 --> 03:43:37.230]  I was accidental.
[03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:40.010]  Well, hey, listen.
[03:43:40.090 --> 03:43:41.930]  As far as accidents go, nice job.
[03:43:42.090 --> 03:43:44.230]  So do we all get one of those in this game?
[03:43:44.990 --> 03:43:45.390]  Sure.
[03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:47.850]  I'm gonna start yanking on my Switch.
[03:43:49.050 --> 03:43:50.290]  Oh, did not properly end
[03:43:50.290 --> 03:43:52.230]  previous Mario Party. Search for room and rejoin.
[03:43:53.270 --> 03:43:54.430]  Nick, you need to, like, quit.
[03:43:55.390 --> 03:43:55.730]  Okay.
[03:43:56.210 --> 03:43:57.230]  Like, save and quit.
[03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:58.510]  Somebody save and quit.
[03:43:59.210 --> 03:44:00.090]  How the fuck do I do that?
[03:44:00.090 --> 03:44:02.350]  You turn off the game, get back into it.
[03:44:02.690 --> 03:44:04.110]  Nick has been discontinued because
[03:44:04.110 --> 03:44:05.930]  the host has left. You've been made the host.
[03:44:06.150 --> 03:44:06.310]  What?
[03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:10.110]  That's why it's
[03:44:10.110 --> 03:44:10.790]  giving me that option.
[03:44:11.050 --> 03:44:13.090]  God damn it.
[03:44:14.390 --> 03:44:17.610]  You guys are a pathetic group.
[03:44:17.810 --> 03:44:18.650]  This is ridiculous.
[03:44:19.250 --> 03:44:20.430]  Hey, man, you're here.
[03:44:20.650 --> 03:44:22.470]  This is absolutely ridiculous.
[03:44:23.850 --> 03:44:25.350]  I think my favorite part
[03:44:25.350 --> 03:44:26.570]  in that, where it kept
[03:44:26.570 --> 03:44:28.130]  moving forward into the game,
[03:44:28.130 --> 03:44:29.250]  where it was like,
[03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:32.350]  oh, weird, there's like a real lack of urgency
[03:44:32.350 --> 03:44:34.290]  from Gavin, and then I saw Gavin ready up
[03:44:34.290 --> 03:44:35.930]  for the game, and I went, oh, okay.
[03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:39.950]  I was just saying if, because I was paused
[03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:41.710]  for so long, if he could join when I wasn't paused.
[03:44:42.250 --> 03:44:44.210]  Oh, I had a bad, I had a dream.
[03:44:44.910 --> 03:44:45.230]  Yeah.
[03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.910]  What did you dream about?
[03:44:47.450 --> 03:44:49.390]  I had another star somehow.
[03:44:50.190 --> 03:44:50.770]  You love that.
[03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:52.610]  That's a crazy dream.
[03:44:54.090 --> 03:44:56.310]  Wait, what happened when I was gone?
[03:44:56.310 --> 03:44:56.910]  I didn't see.
[03:44:57.330 --> 03:44:59.270]  Geoff landed on my star steal trap.
[03:44:59.650 --> 03:45:01.190]  Oh my God.
[03:45:01.270 --> 03:45:02.590]  That's why he had a lot of eagerness.
[03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:05.830]  And he only got 11 coins from you,
[03:45:05.910 --> 03:45:07.470]  despite you not hitting a single button.
[03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:09.370]  Which makes me wonder if it's arbitrary.
[03:45:10.310 --> 03:45:11.190]  Yeah, it must be.
[03:45:11.570 --> 03:45:13.490]  But every time before that, it's been like 16.
[03:45:15.010 --> 03:45:15.250]  Alright.
[03:45:15.410 --> 03:45:17.470]  If Gavin reaches Peach this time,
[03:45:17.470 --> 03:45:19.310]  we have to kick the shit out of him.
[03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:20.670]  Whoa, Nick, why?
[03:45:21.930 --> 03:45:24.010]  Because you're on your way to two stars.
[03:45:24.010 --> 03:45:26.490]  She gives you half off, too, for each of them.
[03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:28.450]  Oh, that's her thing?
[03:45:28.610 --> 03:45:29.070]  Oh God.
[03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:32.370]  Maybe it'll be a different character this time.
[03:45:33.370 --> 03:45:33.590]  Wow.
[03:45:33.790 --> 03:45:35.210]  Turn 25, alright guys.
[03:45:35.210 --> 03:45:37.670]  We didn't save any of them.
[03:45:38.890 --> 03:45:39.930]  Wow, impressive.
[03:45:40.370 --> 03:45:41.550]  Well, I know what not to roll.
[03:45:42.190 --> 03:45:44.150]  Aw, balls, fuck, shit.
[03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.810]  Damn it.
[03:45:47.490 --> 03:45:48.510]  Oh no.
[03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:51.750]  Nick did it again.
[03:45:53.010 --> 03:45:54.510]  Yeah, I rolled one less.
[03:45:54.650 --> 03:45:55.130]  Huzzah.
[03:45:57.330 --> 03:45:59.330]  Oh no, now we find out.
[03:45:59.930 --> 03:46:00.830]  Oh, who is this?
[03:46:01.770 --> 03:46:03.290]  Okay, it didn't count.
[03:46:03.890 --> 03:46:04.370]  Christ.
[03:46:05.310 --> 03:46:06.490]  That question is answered.
[03:46:06.610 --> 03:46:08.370]  Now he can try for Peach again.
[03:46:08.610 --> 03:46:10.170]  What do you think?
[03:46:11.570 --> 03:46:13.190]  Somehow he already knows the board.
[03:46:13.430 --> 03:46:15.570]  Maybe we should play a preliminary turn.
[03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:18.130]  Been 30 minutes counting on your toes again?
[03:46:18.130 --> 03:46:20.130]  Oh no.
[03:46:20.910 --> 03:46:23.430]  This is the opposite of the earlier one.
[03:46:23.590 --> 03:46:24.970]  I think I made it to her.
[03:46:25.290 --> 03:46:26.070]  Oh fuck.
[03:46:28.230 --> 03:46:29.970]  Oh, I'm gonna skip a shot.
[03:46:31.470 --> 03:46:32.430]  And it's gonna launch him
[03:46:32.430 --> 03:46:33.990]  closer to the fucking star.
[03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:36.830]  We have to crush
[03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:38.190]  Gavin here and now.
[03:46:38.250 --> 03:46:38.890]  That's interesting.
[03:46:40.650 --> 03:46:41.810]  I don't remember her minigame.
[03:46:42.190 --> 03:46:43.250]  I don't know.
[03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:44.810]  Do you think it's Nick's fault?
[03:46:45.370 --> 03:46:46.510]  Isn't it like a 3
[03:46:46.510 --> 03:46:47.370]  for the Peach one?
[03:46:48.150 --> 03:46:49.670]  Oh, it's like a gauntlet.
[03:46:50.150 --> 03:46:52.450]  Oh, it's a gauntlet? Okay.
[03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:55.130]  Oh boy.
[03:46:55.570 --> 03:46:55.930]  What are we doing?
[03:46:55.930 --> 03:46:58.790]  Do you think this was part of Gavin and Andrew's shadow pact?
[03:46:59.970 --> 03:47:00.870]  Oh, what an
[03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:02.370]  interesting theory. I doubt it though
[03:47:02.370 --> 03:47:03.470]  because Gavin lost the star.
[03:47:05.730 --> 03:47:06.610]  Oh, what is this
[03:47:06.610 --> 03:47:08.190]  bullshit? Whose wedding is it?
[03:47:10.230 --> 03:47:11.610]  You piece of shit.
[03:47:11.610 --> 03:47:11.910]  Oh.
[03:47:13.070 --> 03:47:13.850]  Dumbass mole.
[03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.630]  Alright.
[03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.450]  Thank you.
[03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:23.470]  Alright.
[03:47:23.930 --> 03:47:25.410]  We have one goal, Andrew.
[03:47:25.730 --> 03:47:26.030]  Yep.
[03:47:27.370 --> 03:47:29.790]  Get a gold box worth 10 points in the first game.
[03:47:30.330 --> 03:47:31.830]  Oh, look at my gold box.
[03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:33.550]  Alright, nobody mess
[03:47:33.550 --> 03:47:35.110]  with me. I've got a gold box.
[03:47:36.210 --> 03:47:36.690]  Kill him.
[03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:38.650]  You're messing with me.
[03:47:38.650 --> 03:47:39.590]  You're messing with me.
[03:47:43.080 --> 03:47:43.920]  Nick is not
[03:47:43.920 --> 03:47:45.200]  messing with Wario at all.
[03:47:45.860 --> 03:47:48.000]  Hold on. Nick does not care.
[03:47:48.820 --> 03:47:49.040]  Nope.
[03:47:51.120 --> 03:47:52.300]  Ah, fuck.
[03:47:52.440 --> 03:47:53.920]  Putting a lot of messing into Wario.
[03:47:54.180 --> 03:47:56.280]  You're never gonna believe it.
[03:47:57.020 --> 03:47:58.100]  You're never gonna believe
[03:47:58.100 --> 03:47:58.600]  what's happening.
[03:48:02.780 --> 03:48:03.300]  Prick.
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:04.480]  Prick.
[03:48:06.660 --> 03:48:07.540]  There you go.
[03:48:07.900 --> 03:48:09.360]  Get that fucking gold box.
[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:11.380]  Oh, fuck.
[03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:13.620]  We hurt ourselves more than that.
[03:48:14.540 --> 03:48:15.480]  I should have just tried
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:17.080]  to do it instead of killing him.
[03:48:18.040 --> 03:48:19.400]  Oh, wow, you didn't even get
[03:48:19.400 --> 03:48:21.420]  any gifts for your dude. No, I knocked all my gifts
[03:48:21.420 --> 03:48:22.840]  off because I was trying to kill Wario.
[03:48:24.660 --> 03:48:25.440]  Instead, the rich
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:26.460]  get riching richer.
[03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:28.600]  It's okay, we got other games.
[03:48:28.700 --> 03:48:29.980]  We got other games.
[03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:31.940]  Yeah, this is good.
[03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:35.360]  Choose a different tray.
[03:48:36.300 --> 03:48:36.600]  What?
[03:48:36.600 --> 03:48:38.320]  Everyone choose a different tray.
[03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:39.740]  From everybody else, I got it.
[03:48:41.120 --> 03:48:41.920]  From everybody else.
[03:48:42.500 --> 03:48:43.520]  Thank you.
[03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:45.280]  Dilkong did well.
[03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:47.220]  You guys suck.
[03:48:47.420 --> 03:48:49.160]  We all chose that one.
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:50.440]  You are dumb.
[03:48:55.680 --> 03:48:56.720]  Thank you.
[03:48:57.900 --> 03:48:58.680]  Oh, no.
[03:49:00.280 --> 03:49:00.800]  Nick and I.
[03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:01.340]  Bollocks.
[03:49:05.480 --> 03:49:06.660]  Now it's happening
[03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:07.340]  so fast.
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:10.060]  Thank you.
[03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:12.640]  I'm not letting you get that shit, Gavin.
[03:49:13.040 --> 03:49:14.580]  There were so many donuts
[03:49:14.580 --> 03:49:15.120]  on it.
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:18.280]  Oh, my God.
[03:49:20.560 --> 03:49:21.600]  All those points.
[03:49:23.340 --> 03:49:24.740]  Smart move.
[03:49:26.580 --> 03:49:28.020]  Smart move.
[03:49:28.020 --> 03:49:29.320]  Oh, my God.
[03:49:29.700 --> 03:49:31.020]  That's fine, I don't care.
[03:49:33.340 --> 03:49:35.200]  We have to not.
[03:49:36.160 --> 03:49:37.320]  Alright, lock in, boys.
[03:49:45.280 --> 03:49:45.840]  Greed.
[03:49:47.220 --> 03:49:48.340]  Thank you.
[03:49:48.740 --> 03:49:50.700]  Now we just have to kill
[03:49:50.700 --> 03:49:52.080]  We just have to beat Gavin.
[03:49:52.540 --> 03:49:53.780]  I don't like this one.
[03:49:54.400 --> 03:49:55.620]  What are we doing here?
[03:49:56.980 --> 03:49:57.920]  Oh, no.
[03:49:58.420 --> 03:49:59.260]  Oh, balls.
[03:49:59.960 --> 03:50:01.700]  Harry with a firework piece.
[03:50:01.740 --> 03:50:02.440]  What the fuck is that?
[03:50:03.620 --> 03:50:04.540]  Blue thing.
[03:50:05.920 --> 03:50:07.060]  Where have I put it?
[03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:08.480]  In your trash can.
[03:50:09.460 --> 03:50:10.920]  You have to figure it out.
[03:50:12.240 --> 03:50:13.440]  Yeah, you should have paid attention.
[03:50:14.380 --> 03:50:15.280]  Red or orange one.
[03:50:17.180 --> 03:50:17.980]  Come on, Nick.
[03:50:18.380 --> 03:50:18.940]  What do you got?
[03:50:23.900 --> 03:50:25.400]  This is not my one.
[03:50:29.620 --> 03:50:31.240]  What am I confused about?
[03:50:31.820 --> 03:50:32.220]  Everything.
[03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:34.020]  She just doesn't want it anymore.
[03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:36.400]  Stop putting things down, Peach.
[03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:37.400]  It's a Sims thing.
[03:50:39.300 --> 03:50:41.280]  You gotta drop that, Andrew.
[03:50:41.560 --> 03:50:42.340]  Press the B button.
[03:50:43.020 --> 03:50:44.120]  He's falling apart.
[03:50:44.360 --> 03:50:46.100]  Circles, circles, circles.
[03:50:48.200 --> 03:50:49.940]  I think I did it.
[03:50:50.100 --> 03:50:51.560]  It's gonna become a dice roll.
[03:50:54.600 --> 03:50:56.580]  I feel like Nick had a pretty good run there.
[03:50:56.580 --> 03:50:57.680]  It felt good.
[03:50:58.580 --> 03:50:59.020]  Nice.
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:12.240]  I spent quite a lot of time trying to put in the first one she wanted after she didn't want it anymore.
[03:51:12.980 --> 03:51:15.440]  I could still give her the one she previously wanted.
[03:51:18.040 --> 03:51:19.560]  Alright, it comes down to them all.
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:22.060]  Looking good for Nick, though.
[03:51:22.760 --> 03:51:23.200]  Yes.
[03:51:24.760 --> 03:51:26.380]  I think Nick did it.
[03:51:27.600 --> 03:51:28.820]  Good game, Geoff.
[03:51:30.260 --> 03:51:32.580]  Alright, we stopped Gavin.
[03:51:32.700 --> 03:51:33.660]  That's the important part.
[03:51:34.200 --> 03:51:39.080]  Yeah, I guess arguably, though, she went to the worst person as far as proximity to anything.
[03:51:39.620 --> 03:51:39.760]  Yep.
[03:51:40.280 --> 03:51:41.760]  Oh, my game crashed.
[03:51:42.260 --> 03:51:42.660]  Pffft.
[03:51:51.960 --> 03:51:53.860]  That's really not fair that that happened to you, Gavin.
[03:51:54.500 --> 03:51:56.320]  You should have my star, it sucks.
[03:51:56.880 --> 03:51:58.540]  Maybe I'll roll 13 again, just to be safe.
[03:52:03.340 --> 03:52:03.740]  Oh.
[03:52:08.760 --> 03:52:09.580]  I'll get a 5.
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:12.340]  Dilkong time, let's see.
[03:52:12.700 --> 03:52:13.620]  Dilkong, baby.
[03:52:14.160 --> 03:52:15.260]  Even worse.
[03:52:15.980 --> 03:52:16.580]  Fantastic.
[03:52:22.380 --> 03:52:23.840]  Oh, it's for you.
[03:52:24.040 --> 03:52:26.420]  What do I get, potentially?
[03:52:28.860 --> 03:52:30.000]  Push the stone.
[03:52:32.960 --> 03:52:34.340]  Gavin, how much is stone?
[03:52:35.100 --> 03:52:35.380]  Stone!
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:38.060]  That was a weak push.
[03:52:38.760 --> 03:52:40.040]  That's good, though, look at that.
[03:52:40.180 --> 03:52:41.260]  Yeah, nice, triple.
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:45.220]  That's gonna come in handy next turn.
[03:52:45.620 --> 03:52:47.480]  I gotta chase down Gavin with that.
[03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:56.850]  Oh, after this we get the speed up thing.
[03:52:56.990 --> 03:52:57.390]  Alright.
[03:52:58.770 --> 03:53:00.250]  Let's not roll a 13.
[03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:02.970]  Oh, I did the block again.
[03:53:06.930 --> 03:53:08.450]  Alright, let's not roll a 13.
[03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:10.330]  Don't roll an 11 or a 13.
[03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:13.350]  Fuck, I should've just stayed with one block, I'd be guaranteed not to.
[03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:15.630]  Yeah, but you would pass Boo then.
[03:53:16.130 --> 03:53:17.290]  Oh god, oh god.
[03:53:17.610 --> 03:53:18.210]  Oh god.
[03:53:19.290 --> 03:53:20.090]  Alright, alright.
[03:53:22.050 --> 03:53:22.850]  You might...
[03:53:23.390 --> 03:53:24.270]  Oh, you did it!
[03:53:24.470 --> 03:53:24.870]  Yes!
[03:53:28.890 --> 03:53:30.430]  Hope is not yet lost.
[03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:33.490]  How many coins do you need to steal a star?
[03:53:33.490 --> 03:53:33.790]  50.
[03:53:35.130 --> 03:53:36.210]  I'll get it right here.
[03:53:36.270 --> 03:53:37.470]  Gotta get Geoff with a win here.
[03:53:39.890 --> 03:53:40.610]  Slide to the edge!
[03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:41.410]  I love slide to the edge!
[03:53:41.570 --> 03:53:42.870]  Hell yeah!
[03:53:43.970 --> 03:53:44.750]  You got this, Geoff!
[03:53:45.370 --> 03:53:47.110]  But he can only get 10 coins, can he?
[03:53:47.810 --> 03:53:48.770]  Yeah, what's he at?
[03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:49.150]  30?
[03:53:51.150 --> 03:53:51.850]  Coins is coins.
[03:53:52.650 --> 03:53:54.750]  I mean, you're gonna not steal a star, I think.
[03:53:54.990 --> 03:53:56.110]  Yeah, maybe I'll get a 1 next time.
[03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:57.890]  Alright, watch the example closely.
[03:53:58.310 --> 03:53:58.770]  You're right.
[03:54:09.770 --> 03:54:10.130]  Okay.
[03:54:10.970 --> 03:54:11.890]  Alright, got it.
[03:54:16.420 --> 03:54:17.060]  Oh, fuck.
[03:54:17.120 --> 03:54:17.400]  I forgot.
[03:54:20.040 --> 03:54:20.480]  Okay.
[03:54:21.080 --> 03:54:22.340]  What's the button to do?
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:22.880]  I think it's A.
[03:54:27.270 --> 03:54:27.710]  Oops.
[03:54:29.310 --> 03:54:29.590]  Yeah.
[03:54:31.930 --> 03:54:32.670]  Oh, wow.
[03:54:33.230 --> 03:54:34.330]  I did it way too early.
[03:54:34.510 --> 03:54:36.070]  Wow, look at that.
[03:54:36.170 --> 03:54:36.570]  Fucked it up.
[03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.950]  Fuck.
[03:54:40.810 --> 03:54:41.990]  I did useless.
[03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:44.090]  I'm a monkey.
[03:54:44.090 --> 03:54:45.710]  I don't understand how any of this works.
[03:54:46.030 --> 03:54:47.190]  Yeah, but you didn't drown.
[03:54:47.570 --> 03:54:48.230]  It's true.
[03:54:48.650 --> 03:54:51.050]  Ice confuses mole.
[03:54:53.230 --> 03:54:54.370]  It's not his biome.
[03:54:55.330 --> 03:54:58.470]  Alright, and that turn is cemented into cannon.
[03:54:59.610 --> 03:55:00.730]  Well, hold on.
[03:55:00.850 --> 03:55:01.350]  Not yet.
[03:55:02.350 --> 03:55:04.110]  We have to wait until we get to the save point.
[03:55:06.230 --> 03:55:06.730]  Saved.
[03:55:07.530 --> 03:55:09.190]  Only 5 coins left.
[03:55:09.430 --> 03:55:10.010]  We're in the home stretch.
[03:55:11.310 --> 03:55:13.510]  Whatever happens here will be...
[03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:15.630]  The same.
[03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:17.190]  Do we find out or do we wait?
[03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:18.550]  I think we should wait.
[03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:20.170]  Oh my god.
[03:55:21.010 --> 03:55:21.870]  Oh, give me stars.
[03:55:22.350 --> 03:55:22.770]  I'm here.
[03:55:25.490 --> 03:55:26.870]  What a fierce competition.
[03:55:29.850 --> 03:55:31.310]  Oh, 6 coins.
[03:55:33.570 --> 03:55:34.130]  Yup.
[03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:36.510]  Oh, duel.
[03:55:37.350 --> 03:55:37.910]  Duel.
[03:55:39.330 --> 03:55:41.430]  Anyone can still pull ahead, except not really.
[03:55:42.350 --> 03:55:42.710]  What?
[03:55:43.890 --> 03:55:44.550]  What is this?
[03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.710]  What's happening?
[03:55:47.330 --> 03:55:48.570]  Wait, I don't think we should...
[03:55:48.570 --> 03:55:49.690]  Should we do this now or no?
[03:55:50.350 --> 03:55:51.970]  I don't know if we can save.
[03:55:52.250 --> 03:55:52.990]  It might be different.
[03:55:54.570 --> 03:55:55.970]  But it's already saved, right?
[03:55:56.330 --> 03:55:58.030]  Oh, okay.
[03:55:58.190 --> 03:55:59.490]  Then I think we need to cut it here.
[03:55:59.610 --> 03:56:02.070]  Because we need to know that...
[03:56:02.530 --> 03:56:03.890]  What we do here can't decide.
[03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.950]  That's tomorrow's turn.
[03:56:06.850 --> 03:56:08.130]  This is already stuck.
[03:56:12.690 --> 03:56:13.690]  This is...
[03:56:13.690 --> 03:56:16.130]  This is already 23 minutes long.
[03:56:16.390 --> 03:56:17.150]  We can't look at the board.
[03:56:17.250 --> 03:56:18.090]  We can't do this tomorrow.
[03:56:18.670 --> 03:56:20.850]  We can't know.
[03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:23.150]  Oh, we can do it earlier.
[03:56:24.150 --> 03:56:25.630]  Yeah, give me a thousand dollars.
[03:56:26.370 --> 03:56:26.630]  Ugh.
[03:56:28.610 --> 03:56:29.950]  Oh, you just have to be an airline.
[03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:31.430]  So I'm gonna quit.
[03:56:31.930 --> 03:56:32.330]  Okay.
[03:56:33.730 --> 03:56:35.490]  So, uh, see you tomorrow.
[03:56:35.890 --> 03:56:36.410]  Alright.
[03:56:37.050 --> 03:56:38.290]  I can't wait.
[03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:39.350]  Bye.
[03:56:40.410 --> 03:56:40.810]  Bye.
[03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:44.470]  Only five turns left.
[03:56:44.710 --> 03:56:46.610]  We're gonna have a shock upset in this game.
[03:56:47.370 --> 03:56:47.950]  I'm ready.
[03:56:48.130 --> 03:56:50.130]  I'm ready to see what Bonus Stars can do in this game.
[03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:51.890]  Final five turns.
[03:56:52.190 --> 03:56:54.550]  Andrew, do you think you'll slam your controller again?
[03:56:54.610 --> 03:56:55.670]  Or do you think we'll...
[03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:58.650]  We'll start and finish in the same timeline.
[03:56:58.790 --> 03:57:00.370]  It's gonna be the same turn.
[03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:02.610]  Listen, I'm locked in. I know you gotta go.
[03:57:03.130 --> 03:57:04.610]  I don't think I could
[03:57:04.610 --> 03:57:06.310]  quit out of the game as quickly
[03:57:06.310 --> 03:57:07.910]  as you did the other day. Or yesterday.
[03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.810]  Yeah, it was crazy.
[03:57:09.350 --> 03:57:11.170]  I was as shocked as you were.
[03:57:11.610 --> 03:57:13.750]  Quitting is a talent, and Andrew has it in spades.
[03:57:13.890 --> 03:57:14.530]  Alright, let's see.
[03:57:15.070 --> 03:57:16.490]  Wait, I got to choose last time.
[03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:18.910]  There you go.
[03:57:19.370 --> 03:57:20.250]  That's what you chose?
[03:57:21.330 --> 03:57:23.730]  I thought it would be a roulette wheel
[03:57:23.730 --> 03:57:25.130]  because I didn't sleep great.
[03:57:25.270 --> 03:57:27.650]  You're a moron! You're an idiot!
[03:57:28.690 --> 03:57:29.890]  You're so stupid!
[03:57:30.430 --> 03:57:31.890]  I'm a person who's having to film a series
[03:57:31.890 --> 03:57:33.990]  at 6.30 AM
[03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:36.050]  because other people wanted it
[03:57:36.050 --> 03:57:36.970]  to be this time.
[03:57:37.250 --> 03:57:40.090]  If this was day four, I'd give it to you.
[03:57:40.270 --> 03:57:41.770]  We're five turns left.
[03:57:41.890 --> 03:57:42.710]  You're crazy.
[03:57:43.390 --> 03:57:45.270]  I don't like the way he said other people.
[03:57:46.470 --> 03:57:47.930]  What do you mean other people?
[03:57:48.090 --> 03:57:48.970]  I didn't choose this time.
[03:57:49.170 --> 03:57:50.290]  I agreed to this time.
[03:57:50.390 --> 03:57:53.210]  I feel like we all agreed to this time.
[03:57:53.330 --> 03:57:55.750]  I feel like if anybody chose this time, it was probably Andrew.
[03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:57.170]  Are you...?
[03:57:57.170 --> 03:57:58.110]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[03:57:59.150 --> 03:58:01.110]  Andrew was like, I want to start my day off with Mario.
[03:58:01.110 --> 03:58:03.590]  You said that. You're like, I need an excuse to get up early in the day.
[03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:04.290]  I need to wake up.
[03:58:04.290 --> 03:58:06.850]  I showed up 30 fucking minutes for you today early
[03:58:07.190 --> 03:58:08.610]  and this is what I get.
[03:58:09.250 --> 03:58:10.030]  This is what I get.
[03:58:10.530 --> 03:58:12.350]  Hanging out, enjoying, spending time,
[03:58:12.930 --> 03:58:14.450]  sharing our personal lives.
[03:58:14.610 --> 03:58:15.230]  This is what I get.
[03:58:15.570 --> 03:58:17.890]  I try to do a kindness for Geoff, this is what I get.
[03:58:18.310 --> 03:58:20.190]  Hang on, Gavin's looking at the board.
[03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.970]  Yeah.
[03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:23.470]  That's a weird thing to do in this game.
[03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:25.670]  Please roll a three.
[03:58:26.230 --> 03:58:27.170]  Roll a one and a one.
[03:58:27.170 --> 03:58:29.690]  Just a bunch of star traps coming up.
[03:58:30.010 --> 03:58:31.430]  Roll two and one.
[03:58:31.570 --> 03:58:31.910]  One and two.
[03:58:32.610 --> 03:58:33.690]  One, one, one.
[03:58:35.390 --> 03:58:35.830]  Four.
[03:58:38.770 --> 03:58:39.210]  Yeah!
[03:58:40.370 --> 03:58:40.630]  Wow.
[03:58:41.530 --> 03:58:42.050]  Six is low.
[03:58:42.650 --> 03:58:43.350]  I'll take it.
[03:58:44.690 --> 03:58:46.930]  I think you bypassed my star straps though.
[03:58:47.010 --> 03:58:49.070]  Oh yeah, you get some star steel things.
[03:58:49.590 --> 03:58:51.570]  You probably want to get those mushroom tickets.
[03:58:52.350 --> 03:58:52.710]  Honestly,
[03:58:53.370 --> 03:58:55.630]  the quad dice are going to get you around that board
[03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:56.490]  way faster.
[03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:59.010]  Cool, thanks.
[03:58:59.590 --> 03:59:00.390]  Yeah man, no problem.
[03:59:01.990 --> 03:59:03.570]  Figured I'd give you a little bit of friendly advice
[03:59:03.570 --> 03:59:04.370]  on turn twenty-six.
[03:59:06.010 --> 03:59:07.530]  Blaine actually told me to tell you that.
[03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:09.590]  I feel like I lost a few turns
[03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:10.630]  all about precision.
[03:59:12.170 --> 03:59:13.590]  Oh my god.
[03:59:13.610 --> 03:59:14.350]  Damn it to hell!
[03:59:16.270 --> 03:59:16.670]  Wow.
[03:59:17.490 --> 03:59:18.790]  His luck once again.
[03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:21.450]  I don't think I'd much like to play a Mario Party game in one sitting.
[03:59:23.350 --> 03:59:23.750]  Okay,
[03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:24.490]  here we go.
[03:59:25.850 --> 03:59:27.890]  Yeah, how many months are left
[03:59:27.890 --> 03:59:28.890]  in your Blaine game?
[03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.750]  It was over
[03:59:31.750 --> 03:59:32.270]  pretty quick.
[03:59:34.370 --> 03:59:35.590]  Don't need to look at the board
[03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:36.690]  because I'm going straight.
[03:59:40.990 --> 03:59:41.470]  Fantastic.
[03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:43.210]  Bah!
[03:59:44.670 --> 03:59:46.130]  I mean that...
[03:59:46.610 --> 03:59:47.090]  Yeah.
[03:59:47.730 --> 03:59:47.930]  Yeah.
[03:59:50.170 --> 03:59:50.410]  Ooh.
[03:59:51.270 --> 03:59:52.190]  Nice dude.
[03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:54.530]  Jeez man, that is a lot of coins.
[03:59:54.730 --> 03:59:56.390]  Right in your brain.
[04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.570]  Okay.
[04:00:02.250 --> 04:00:02.690]  Man.
[04:00:05.370 --> 04:00:07.010]  Got some money to spend
[04:00:07.010 --> 04:00:07.690]  next turn.
[04:00:08.170 --> 04:00:10.210]  It's everybody's favorite mole, it's
[04:00:10.210 --> 04:00:10.930]  Mommy Mole.
[04:00:11.250 --> 04:00:13.190]  Be very careful.
[04:00:13.870 --> 04:00:14.930]  Geoff, double dice, go crazy.
[04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:17.090]  It's time to go insane.
[04:00:17.090 --> 04:00:18.970]  Gotta avoid these traps.
[04:00:19.050 --> 04:00:20.430]  Double dice is the move.
[04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:23.290]  Yeah, listen to Nick, the guy in first place.
[04:00:23.890 --> 04:00:24.010]  Alright.
[04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:26.710]  Do I wanna go high or low here?
[04:00:26.810 --> 04:00:27.910]  I'm gonna go high.
[04:00:28.430 --> 04:00:29.770]  I'll go ahead and get a ten here.
[04:00:30.270 --> 04:00:30.750]  Six is close.
[04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:33.210]  Perfect.
[04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:35.330]  Nice.
[04:00:37.070 --> 04:00:39.270]  Now, I assume you're taking coins here.
[04:00:39.870 --> 04:00:41.230]  Oh, I'm gonna have to take coins
[04:00:41.230 --> 04:00:42.570]  because I don't have enough money.
[04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:43.810]  But from who?
[04:00:45.710 --> 04:00:46.150]  Don't.
[04:00:46.290 --> 04:00:47.590]  Don't do the thing that you do.
[04:00:47.950 --> 04:00:49.210]  Mario's got the interest.
[04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:51.650]  Cripple the guy with five.
[04:00:52.110 --> 04:00:54.230]  Cripple the guy who's gonna buy the things.
[04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:55.810]  Geoff, you could leave it up to chance.
[04:00:55.890 --> 04:00:57.070]  It's been working for you so far.
[04:00:57.250 --> 04:00:58.630]  It hasn't worked at all.
[04:00:59.390 --> 04:01:00.610]  You know what, Eric brings up a good point.
[04:01:01.210 --> 04:01:02.890]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[04:01:03.270 --> 04:01:06.050]  What does fate have
[04:01:06.050 --> 04:01:08.110]  against Nick? I don't get it.
[04:01:08.490 --> 04:01:09.830]  This is the best game ever made.
[04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:11.550]  I don't understand.
[04:01:12.150 --> 04:01:13.670]  Why does the universe
[04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:15.990]  hate Nick? I didn't want to take from Nick.
[04:01:16.430 --> 04:01:17.590]  Then you shouldn't have.
[04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.910]  Then just don't.
[04:01:19.370 --> 04:01:21.630]  I didn't fate, karma did.
[04:01:21.970 --> 04:01:23.170]  I left it to chance.
[04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:25.690]  It's the fairest thing
[04:01:25.690 --> 04:01:27.590]  I can do is to leave it
[04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:28.290]  to chance.
[04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:37.650]  For the record, I didn't want any of that to happen
[04:01:37.650 --> 04:01:38.050]  to Nick.
[04:01:38.050 --> 04:01:39.810]  Then why did you do it?
[04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:40.410]  You enabled it.
[04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:43.830]  The universe did it, Nick.
[04:01:44.410 --> 04:01:45.790]  You enabled the universe.
[04:01:46.210 --> 04:01:48.470]  It's this fucking universe, man.
[04:01:55.660 --> 04:01:56.060]  Sandwiched.
[04:01:56.100 --> 04:01:57.900]  I suck at sandwiched.
[04:01:59.280 --> 04:02:01.520]  That's weird because I'd consider you
[04:02:01.520 --> 04:02:03.200]  the most sandwiched guy here.
[04:02:04.480 --> 04:02:05.460]  Oh, this one's not bad.
[04:02:05.520 --> 04:02:06.000]  This is a different one.
[04:02:06.000 --> 04:02:07.380]  I thought it was the one where you put...
[04:02:07.380 --> 04:02:09.900]  I thought it was the one where you assemble sandwiches, which I do suck at.
[04:02:09.960 --> 04:02:10.560]  This I'm okay with.
[04:02:12.220 --> 04:02:13.260]  That's good to know.
[04:02:14.560 --> 04:02:15.680]  All of them. I'm hungry.
[04:02:16.640 --> 04:02:18.060]  Dude, this looks like a mayonnaise
[04:02:18.060 --> 04:02:19.220]  basket. No, thank you.
[04:02:19.460 --> 04:02:20.640]  That egg one looks great.
[04:02:22.160 --> 04:02:22.520]  Egg.
[04:02:24.520 --> 04:02:27.440]  Sorry, DK.
[04:02:28.480 --> 04:02:29.040]  That's okay.
[04:02:29.680 --> 04:02:29.880]  Sorry.
[04:02:30.280 --> 04:02:33.280]  Oh, Wario got egg crushed.
[04:02:33.280 --> 04:02:35.680]  Oh, Monty Mole got egg crushed.
[04:02:36.400 --> 04:02:37.160]  My depth perception
[04:02:37.160 --> 04:02:39.160]  doesn't come on until about nine.
[04:02:41.760 --> 04:02:42.580]  Sorry, DK.
[04:02:43.960 --> 04:02:45.560]  You're doing great, Nick.
[04:02:45.760 --> 04:02:47.040]  Lock in, Nick.
[04:02:47.180 --> 04:02:47.720]  Lock in, Nick.
[04:02:47.920 --> 04:02:51.360]  Nick is hitting as many buttons as he can as quickly as possible.
[04:02:53.440 --> 04:02:54.320]  I think...
[04:02:55.060 --> 04:02:57.260]  I like that Nick started out of panic
[04:02:57.260 --> 04:02:59.780]  and then it continued the whole way through that round.
[04:03:00.200 --> 04:03:00.860]  Too much coffee.
[04:03:00.860 --> 04:03:01.980]  Oh, the dill needed that.
[04:03:02.240 --> 04:03:04.760]  I feel like the real villain today is the universe.
[04:03:04.980 --> 04:03:07.100]  Yeah, I agree, Geoff. I gotta agree with you, man.
[04:03:07.420 --> 04:03:08.940]  I think it's you and your random.
[04:03:09.140 --> 04:03:09.960]  It wasn't me!
[04:03:10.440 --> 04:03:12.600]  How many times have you put me on random?
[04:03:13.580 --> 04:03:15.240]  It's the fairest thing I can do.
[04:03:15.660 --> 04:03:15.920]  No!
[04:03:18.520 --> 04:03:20.660]  The least fair thing I can do
[04:03:20.660 --> 04:03:23.780]  would just be to pick you straight out.
[04:03:23.780 --> 04:03:24.760]  Let's take a look at the board.
[04:03:25.440 --> 04:03:26.300]  Let's have a look at the board.
[04:03:26.760 --> 04:03:27.540]  Gavin loves doing this.
[04:03:27.540 --> 04:03:29.040]  He's got 10 to the star!
[04:03:29.300 --> 04:03:30.580]  And he can call it perfectly
[04:03:30.580 --> 04:03:32.740]  with either of his dice blocks that he has.
[04:03:32.920 --> 04:03:34.560]  Not sounding good for us.
[04:03:34.980 --> 04:03:36.540]  Not sounding great.
[04:03:37.060 --> 04:03:39.800]  Dilkong is in the danger zone with two of my star steals
[04:03:39.800 --> 04:03:41.960]  and because Gavin's gonna get the star in the next turn
[04:03:41.960 --> 04:03:43.460]  he's gonna have to go the route that
[04:03:43.460 --> 04:03:44.700]  he could lose half his coins.
[04:03:44.860 --> 04:03:47.900]  I hate to correct you, Nick. You need to have a star to be in the danger zone.
[04:03:47.900 --> 04:03:48.240]  Yeah, you don't have one.
[04:03:49.820 --> 04:03:50.540]  Never mind.
[04:03:52.400 --> 04:03:53.560]  Geoff's about to get some money.
[04:03:54.120 --> 04:03:54.560]  Hell yeah.
[04:03:54.560 --> 04:03:55.980]  Geoff just got a bunch of money.
[04:03:56.340 --> 04:03:57.300]  He's about to get more.
[04:03:58.160 --> 04:03:59.540]  And double dosh because of Peach.
[04:04:01.400 --> 04:04:02.240]  And I'm fucked.
[04:04:03.980 --> 04:04:04.860]  We're all fucked.
[04:04:05.360 --> 04:04:05.500]  Yep.
[04:04:05.880 --> 04:04:07.520]  We need something crazy to happen.
[04:04:07.980 --> 04:04:08.980]  We're getting close to 30.
[04:04:09.520 --> 04:04:12.880]  Be there as we close in and see where this all takes us.
[04:04:13.320 --> 04:04:14.460]  But for now, we'll see you tomorrow.
[04:04:15.140 --> 04:04:15.420]  Bye!
[04:04:17.420 --> 04:04:19.080]  I'm gonna take such a shit after this.
[04:04:19.240 --> 04:04:20.360]  Come on, man.
[04:04:20.460 --> 04:04:21.700]  We only have a few more turns.
[04:04:22.220 --> 04:04:23.600]  Don't be Gavin.
[04:04:23.720 --> 04:04:24.700]  Don't be Gavin.
[04:04:24.840 --> 04:04:27.080]  Why did it show me there?
[04:04:27.320 --> 04:04:27.940]  What did I do?
[04:04:28.820 --> 04:04:29.820]  Did it show you?
[04:04:32.240 --> 04:04:33.860]  It heard someone was taking a shit.
[04:04:34.920 --> 04:04:35.960]  Not yet.
[04:04:36.380 --> 04:04:36.920]  Just assumed.
[04:04:37.960 --> 04:04:39.540]  It just pointed the camera at the shit machine.
[04:04:41.440 --> 04:04:42.740]  That's what we call you.
[04:04:44.200 --> 04:04:45.580]  It got me past the danger zone.
[04:04:46.940 --> 04:04:49.420]  The move here is items.
[04:04:49.420 --> 04:04:50.300]  Yeah, I think so.
[04:04:52.980 --> 04:04:54.220]  Man, Nick, you have so much money.
[04:04:54.380 --> 04:04:54.620]  Yeah.
[04:04:54.720 --> 04:04:57.820]  Do you think it counts the laps you pass through the items?
[04:04:58.080 --> 04:04:58.960]  I think it does.
[04:04:59.140 --> 04:05:01.640]  And then if you go through the regular hole, you get that many laps.
[04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:02.820]  There's no way it does.
[04:05:03.700 --> 04:05:04.360]  It doesn't?
[04:05:04.780 --> 04:05:06.400]  If it does, then I would...
[04:05:06.840 --> 04:05:08.420]  Oh, man, I would have so much regret.
[04:05:08.500 --> 04:05:12.040]  Because I purposely have not gotten items to get the coins.
[04:05:12.720 --> 04:05:13.380]  Yeah, but you...
[04:05:13.380 --> 04:05:14.880]  We didn't get the coins from those.
[04:05:14.960 --> 04:05:16.960]  But I'm just saying, would it pay the amount of laps?
[04:05:16.960 --> 04:05:18.660]  Oh, that's interesting.
[04:05:18.760 --> 04:05:20.540]  Because I think like...
[04:05:20.540 --> 04:05:22.020]  Oh, wow, ten? No way.
[04:05:22.160 --> 04:05:24.200]  I was hoping you clicked the wrong one.
[04:05:26.100 --> 04:05:27.460]  Javi, six stars.
[04:05:28.180 --> 04:05:29.060]  At last.
[04:05:29.060 --> 04:05:29.560]  Good lord.
[04:05:29.640 --> 04:05:31.460]  At last, Wario gets a star.
[04:05:31.940 --> 04:05:32.900]  I'm so excited.
[04:05:33.080 --> 04:05:36.400]  I think you should be prioritizing the chance type.
[04:05:37.780 --> 04:05:42.640]  So, is this the first star you've purchased by non-ilgottengames?
[04:05:43.160 --> 04:05:43.600]  Yeah.
[04:05:43.900 --> 04:05:45.520]  Is this your first non...
[04:05:45.520 --> 04:05:48.840]  Is this your first above-board legitimate star?
[04:05:49.440 --> 04:05:49.620]  Yeah.
[04:05:50.740 --> 04:05:52.460]  Is this the first star you have
[04:05:52.460 --> 04:05:54.240]  without somebody's name written on the back of it?
[04:05:54.240 --> 04:05:54.420]  Yeah.
[04:05:56.080 --> 04:05:58.420]  I think that's my second legitimate star.
[04:05:58.440 --> 04:05:58.960]  I think it is.
[04:05:59.260 --> 04:06:02.480]  Do you have any idea how many stars I've purchased?
[04:06:03.760 --> 04:06:04.780]  I am excited
[04:06:04.780 --> 04:06:06.640]  to go back and watch this entire video
[04:06:06.640 --> 04:06:08.540]  and just keep rewinding
[04:06:08.540 --> 04:06:10.240]  to the parts where Nick fucked up
[04:06:10.240 --> 04:06:11.420]  over and over again.
[04:06:12.220 --> 04:06:14.420]  I'll be honest, the reason I have six stars
[04:06:14.420 --> 04:06:15.820]  and there's no one really close
[04:06:15.820 --> 04:06:18.920]  is entirely people screwing themselves over.
[04:06:19.320 --> 04:06:20.560]  It's nothing I've done.
[04:06:20.880 --> 04:06:21.320]  Yes.
[04:06:22.520 --> 04:06:23.520]  I'll take a ten.
[04:06:24.920 --> 04:06:25.560]  You also
[04:06:27.200 --> 04:06:28.760]  fucked me pretty hard on the chance.
[04:06:28.960 --> 04:06:29.020]  Yeah.
[04:06:33.020 --> 04:06:34.340]  This is tough.
[04:06:34.540 --> 04:06:35.380]  This is really tough.
[04:06:36.580 --> 04:06:38.140]  You gotta full balls it, Andrew.
[04:06:38.740 --> 04:06:40.080]  You surely want the trip
[04:06:40.080 --> 04:06:42.200]  because you were saying that you weren't
[04:06:42.200 --> 04:06:43.640]  ever going to get around to Boo again.
[04:06:44.180 --> 04:06:44.840]  He's right.
[04:06:44.960 --> 04:06:47.980]  I think it's gotta be the quadruple dice
[04:06:47.980 --> 04:06:49.700]  and you just hit big numbers
[04:06:49.700 --> 04:06:51.540]  and hopefully end up right before it.
[04:06:51.820 --> 04:06:52.880]  Do I try to put two?
[04:06:53.360 --> 04:06:56.120]  That's such a crazy chance. I mean, you can.
[04:06:56.940 --> 04:06:58.480]  Is this the only way
[04:06:58.480 --> 04:06:59.940]  I would get a third star?
[04:07:02.320 --> 04:07:03.560]  There's no other scenario.
[04:07:03.740 --> 04:07:06.500]  Not if you get enough of a big roll
[04:07:06.500 --> 04:07:08.440]  next turn, then you haul ass
[04:07:08.440 --> 04:07:10.500]  through Boo and the star, and then you
[04:07:10.500 --> 04:07:12.360]  get to pass go,
[04:07:12.480 --> 04:07:13.800]  get more items, and then continue.
[04:07:14.080 --> 04:07:16.640]  I just don't. That's a lot.
[04:07:17.620 --> 04:07:18.660]  You could do trip dice
[04:07:18.660 --> 04:07:20.080]  and it'll stop you at the star
[04:07:20.080 --> 04:07:21.220]  and it'll put you further.
[04:07:21.860 --> 04:07:24.400]  I think if your goal
[04:07:24.400 --> 04:07:26.240]  is the star and Boo, it's gotta be
[04:07:26.240 --> 04:07:27.220]  two trip dices.
[04:07:28.280 --> 04:07:29.660]  Can you buy more than one?
[04:07:29.800 --> 04:07:30.680]  No, you can only do one.
[04:07:31.300 --> 04:07:34.620]  What item here gets you five stars in the next four turns?
[04:07:35.380 --> 04:07:36.320]  That's a great
[04:07:36.320 --> 04:07:38.020]  really good question.
[04:07:38.120 --> 04:07:39.540]  I tell you what, it's the custard block.
[04:07:39.920 --> 04:07:42.900]  If you time landing on chance time, that's how you can get five stars.
[04:07:43.240 --> 04:07:44.600]  Yeah, I mean it probably
[04:07:44.600 --> 04:07:45.640]  is the chance time thing.
[04:07:46.200 --> 04:07:48.840]  But you have to get all the way around there
[04:07:48.840 --> 04:07:50.720]  because last turn you didn't add any more
[04:07:50.720 --> 04:07:51.220]  to the map.
[04:07:53.580 --> 04:07:54.560]  He's gonna do
[04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:55.700]  the star steal thing.
[04:07:58.920 --> 04:08:00.600]  I knew it!
[04:08:01.500 --> 04:08:01.680]  Well,
[04:08:01.680 --> 04:08:03.760]  it was a nice shot
[04:08:03.760 --> 04:08:04.460]  you had, Andrew.
[04:08:05.000 --> 04:08:06.260]  He really did it.
[04:08:07.060 --> 04:08:08.540]  Nobody's gonna land on these.
[04:08:10.880 --> 04:08:12.420]  There's three turns left.
[04:08:14.720 --> 04:08:15.960]  Big spender achievement.
[04:08:16.300 --> 04:08:17.880]  He's putting them behind you.
[04:08:23.380 --> 04:08:24.760]  I mean, I'm all
[04:08:24.760 --> 04:08:26.700]  for more hate on the map, but that's great.
[04:08:27.680 --> 04:08:28.580]  Yeah, I don't...
[04:08:29.780 --> 04:08:30.160]  Great.
[04:08:30.480 --> 04:08:32.240]  You can put one down each turn.
[04:08:34.780 --> 04:08:35.160]  Andrew.
[04:08:36.340 --> 04:08:36.720]  Andrew.
[04:08:38.960 --> 04:08:39.340]  Andrew.
[04:08:41.040 --> 04:08:41.800]  Let's roll
[04:08:41.800 --> 04:08:42.860]  23 here, Peach.
[04:08:42.900 --> 04:08:44.680]  I had three stars at one point.
[04:08:44.820 --> 04:08:45.660]  Hey, I had a lot too.
[04:08:47.080 --> 04:08:48.740]  I'll take a billion coins, thank you.
[04:08:49.040 --> 04:08:50.780]  30. Okay, it doesn't count.
[04:08:51.080 --> 04:08:53.600]  No, I don't think it does because he's gotta be around
[04:08:53.600 --> 04:08:54.420]  more than three times, right?
[04:08:54.420 --> 04:08:55.260]  He's gonna get another 30.
[04:08:57.520 --> 04:08:58.320]  Drowning in them coins.
[04:08:58.320 --> 04:09:00.520]  That's awesome. That's the equivalent of six laps.
[04:09:01.340 --> 04:09:01.780]  I'm...
[04:09:03.260 --> 04:09:04.360]  Swimming in the nick level
[04:09:04.360 --> 04:09:05.280]  of money now.
[04:09:05.840 --> 04:09:06.280]  Ooh.
[04:09:08.660 --> 04:09:10.200]  I'm gonna close my eyes.
[04:09:10.320 --> 04:09:10.860]  I'm gonna close my eyes.
[04:09:11.020 --> 04:09:13.960]  And I'm not gonna know you before I do.
[04:09:14.200 --> 04:09:15.580]  It's an item in the game.
[04:09:16.140 --> 04:09:17.160]  Good luck.
[04:09:17.640 --> 04:09:18.720]  Do you get to do this twice?
[04:09:20.100 --> 04:09:20.800]  Two questions.
[04:09:22.420 --> 04:09:23.420]  Stop the wheel.
[04:09:24.220 --> 04:09:24.580]  Start.
[04:09:24.580 --> 04:09:26.300]  I think he gets to roll the thing again.
[04:09:30.270 --> 04:09:31.330]  Oh, I... Okay.
[04:09:31.890 --> 04:09:32.990]  I'll take that. That's fine.
[04:09:33.350 --> 04:09:34.450]  That's a triple or a double.
[04:09:34.890 --> 04:09:36.210]  Whoa! Shit.
[04:09:37.610 --> 04:09:39.570]  I've never done this minigame before.
[04:09:40.330 --> 04:09:41.710]  I'll take that. That's what I wanted.
[04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:44.370]  See, I think triple dice
[04:09:44.370 --> 04:09:45.510]  is too flashy.
[04:09:45.770 --> 04:09:46.770]  I'm more of a two dice guy.
[04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:50.050]  Like when you see fuzzy dice hanging from your
[04:09:50.050 --> 04:09:51.690]  windshield in a car, there's never three.
[04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:52.890]  There's only two of them, baby.
[04:09:52.890 --> 04:09:54.990]  Although, I feel like maybe Unifarm
[04:09:54.990 --> 04:09:56.450]  could get into the triple fuzzy dice.
[04:09:56.710 --> 04:09:58.630]  You know what to do this time if it's the same game.
[04:09:58.670 --> 04:10:01.370]  Should Unifarm sell triple dice? That's a great idea.
[04:10:02.250 --> 04:10:03.110]  Somebody write that down.
[04:10:03.610 --> 04:10:03.930]  Oh, wow.
[04:10:05.710 --> 04:10:06.410]  Pair him up.
[04:10:06.470 --> 04:10:07.350]  What's the item I want?
[04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:09.750]  Oh, shit.
[04:10:11.230 --> 04:10:12.230]  You want triple dice?
[04:10:14.130 --> 04:10:14.590]  Oh, well.
[04:10:14.890 --> 04:10:16.510]  We're gonna go...
[04:10:16.510 --> 04:10:19.130]  I could've helped.
[04:10:19.530 --> 04:10:19.630]  Okay.
[04:10:19.630 --> 04:10:20.430]  Okay.
[04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:22.190]  Bottom left.
[04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.930]  Okay.
[04:10:25.550 --> 04:10:26.930]  Wow, how is it not...
[04:10:27.480 --> 04:10:28.790]  That would've been a huge help, Andrew.
[04:10:29.110 --> 04:10:31.330]  Me too. I thought it was bottom left also.
[04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:32.330]  100%.
[04:10:32.330 --> 04:10:36.410]  Well, you already weren't.
[04:10:36.730 --> 04:10:37.650]  You don't need to make a note
[04:10:37.650 --> 04:10:38.810]  of the thing you already weren't doing.
[04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:41.850]  He's got so many star steals that no one's ever gonna reach.
[04:10:42.150 --> 04:10:43.330]  What the hell are you talking about?
[04:10:44.270 --> 04:10:45.450]  I've decided for you to place
[04:10:45.450 --> 04:10:47.270]  your final star steal on turn 30.
[04:10:49.270 --> 04:10:50.070]  For Geoff
[04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:51.230]  to have a shot at it.
[04:10:51.890 --> 04:10:52.770]  Tilt the golf.
[04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:54.830]  It can only get Geoff.
[04:10:56.110 --> 04:10:57.310]  I could get Geoff like
[04:10:57.310 --> 04:10:58.010]  three times.
[04:11:00.190 --> 04:11:02.070]  I got that many stars.
[04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:03.590]  Oh, what is this?
[04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:05.370]  Oh, what is this?
[04:11:05.690 --> 04:11:06.270]  Tilt golf?
[04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:08.510]  Oh, this is cool.
[04:11:10.930 --> 04:11:11.370]  Alright.
[04:11:11.450 --> 04:11:12.270]  Why isn't mine tilting?
[04:11:13.350 --> 04:11:14.050]  You have to hit A first.
[04:11:16.430 --> 04:11:17.150]  Tilt golf.
[04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:18.610]  Tilt the golf.
[04:11:22.030 --> 04:11:22.970]  Flick to bounce.
[04:11:24.490 --> 04:11:25.530]  You get more points if what?
[04:11:25.650 --> 04:11:25.970]  What was that?
[04:11:26.370 --> 04:11:26.950]  I didn't see it.
[04:11:28.250 --> 04:11:28.810]  Where'd he go?
[04:11:31.870 --> 04:11:32.490]  Oh, shit.
[04:11:35.370 --> 04:11:36.010]  Oh, no!
[04:11:36.610 --> 04:11:37.310]  Oh, Wario.
[04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:40.310]  Oh my god, you can't get out of the sands.
[04:11:40.690 --> 04:11:41.550]  You gotta bump it, baby.
[04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:42.330]  You gotta hit the button.
[04:11:42.990 --> 04:11:43.770]  There you go.
[04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:47.130]  The mole is...
[04:11:47.130 --> 04:11:47.710]  Oh, wow.
[04:11:48.610 --> 04:11:49.550]  Moles on a roll, baby.
[04:11:50.130 --> 04:11:51.030]  Moles on a roll.
[04:11:52.650 --> 04:11:53.530]  There you go.
[04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:55.690]  Here's the next one.
[04:11:55.810 --> 04:11:56.350]  Let's go, boys.
[04:11:59.630 --> 04:12:00.610]  Oh, he said let's play.
[04:12:00.750 --> 04:12:01.170]  That's to sue him.
[04:12:01.170 --> 04:12:02.350]  Sue his ass.
[04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:07.110]  Here we go.
[04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.870]  Yeah, baby.
[04:12:09.350 --> 04:12:10.390]  Oh, I had it.
[04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:12.010]  Oh, no.
[04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:14.070]  Oh, Gavin.
[04:12:14.270 --> 04:12:17.550]  I was teasing the rib for so long.
[04:12:17.550 --> 04:12:18.430]  Damn it, Gavin.
[04:12:18.690 --> 04:12:20.450]  You fucked me.
[04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:22.290]  How did I...
[04:12:22.290 --> 04:12:25.510]  If you were half a second faster, then I would have tied with Nick.
[04:12:27.090 --> 04:12:27.550]  Oh.
[04:12:28.810 --> 04:12:30.690]  You're too busy teasing the rim.
[04:12:31.410 --> 04:12:32.030]  Teasing it.
[04:12:34.490 --> 04:12:35.050]  Damn.
[04:12:35.050 --> 04:12:36.470]  Well done, Mario.
[04:12:36.770 --> 04:12:37.950]  Great job, Mario.
[04:12:38.370 --> 04:12:39.550]  Had to bounce back after the sand trap.
[04:12:39.570 --> 04:12:40.170]  That was a fun game.
[04:12:40.970 --> 04:12:41.810]  Yeah, that was cool.
[04:12:42.110 --> 04:12:42.590]  I liked that one.
[04:12:43.310 --> 04:12:47.410]  I jumped almost straight in the hole in the last one, and then I just sucked the rim for about three seconds.
[04:12:49.390 --> 04:12:50.330]  Oh, more points.
[04:12:50.570 --> 04:12:50.790]  Nice.
[04:12:52.570 --> 04:12:55.130]  Was that a big change to the standings, you guys?
[04:12:55.290 --> 04:12:55.730]  No.
[04:12:56.090 --> 04:12:56.790]  Everything flipped.
[04:12:57.110 --> 04:12:59.890]  Let's take a look at the board.
[04:13:00.350 --> 04:13:00.830]  Oh, goodbye.
[04:13:05.820 --> 04:13:07.720]  Hey, Peach, thanks for all that extra shit you got me.
[04:13:07.720 --> 04:13:08.320]  Geoff, you gotta hit A.
[04:13:09.560 --> 04:13:10.420]  I will hit A.
[04:13:11.720 --> 04:13:12.820]  Go to sleep.
[04:13:14.540 --> 04:13:15.360]  I would like to go to sleep.
[04:13:15.420 --> 04:13:16.880]  Alright, on the board.
[04:13:17.420 --> 04:13:18.060]  Let's see.
[04:13:19.040 --> 04:13:22.700]  I can go through start and get a couple of items.
[04:13:22.920 --> 04:13:24.520]  Geoff, meanwhile, has his...
[04:13:24.520 --> 04:13:24.680]  What?
[04:13:24.920 --> 04:13:28.300]  He can use his double blocks and come up to the star.
[04:13:28.400 --> 04:13:28.660]  Maybe?
[04:13:29.360 --> 04:13:30.320]  He's how many away?
[04:13:30.320 --> 04:13:32.140]  19. So you'd have to roll pretty high, Geoff.
[04:13:33.560 --> 04:13:34.040]  Meanwhile...
[04:13:34.040 --> 04:13:34.620]  I'd have to roll 19.
[04:13:35.540 --> 04:13:38.700]  DK's four away from the star. He could put down some star traps.
[04:13:39.480 --> 04:13:40.560]  Just for Geoff.
[04:13:40.980 --> 04:13:41.440]  Maybe me.
[04:13:41.900 --> 04:13:44.640]  And Gavin is entering the danger zone.
[04:13:44.920 --> 04:13:46.060]  He could hit Boo.
[04:13:46.260 --> 04:13:47.880]  He could hit a couple of star steals.
[04:13:48.580 --> 04:13:49.240]  Chance time.
[04:13:49.920 --> 04:13:50.880]  Or Bowser.
[04:13:51.200 --> 04:13:53.040]  I want to put a question to the audience.
[04:13:53.300 --> 04:13:54.260]  I've got six stars.
[04:13:54.700 --> 04:13:58.320]  Do you think it's worth it, audience, if I try and land on chance time
[04:13:58.320 --> 04:14:01.780]  to steal more stars after Boo?
[04:14:03.440 --> 04:14:05.080]  Can we say yes?
[04:14:06.420 --> 04:14:07.320]  Oh, fuck.
[04:14:07.380 --> 04:14:09.080]  He's going to steal one of Geoff's stars.
[04:14:09.680 --> 04:14:10.100]  Maybe.
[04:14:10.460 --> 04:14:10.960]  Or Nick.
[04:14:11.340 --> 04:14:11.980]  I mean, ideally.
[04:14:12.620 --> 04:14:14.020]  Nick has one star.
[04:14:14.860 --> 04:14:16.780]  You've already taken everything from me.
[04:14:16.900 --> 04:14:17.400]  Take one more.
[04:14:18.020 --> 04:14:21.100]  You've already taken everything from me.
[04:14:21.240 --> 04:14:22.520]  Oh, my God.
[04:14:22.660 --> 04:14:22.800]  Wait.
[04:14:23.220 --> 04:14:25.120]  How many are you away from that, Gavin?
[04:14:26.700 --> 04:14:27.140]  10.
[04:14:27.740 --> 04:14:28.120]  Is it 10?
[04:14:28.300 --> 04:14:30.600]  Ah, shit.
[04:14:31.900 --> 04:14:32.660]  I mean, when
[04:14:32.660 --> 04:14:34.880]  Dilkong betrayed me on turn 15
[04:14:34.880 --> 04:14:36.760]  or whatever, I did declare that Dilkong
[04:14:36.760 --> 04:14:38.900]  was dead, but...
[04:14:38.900 --> 04:14:39.440]  Gavin,
[04:14:40.840 --> 04:14:43.100]  if you go steal that star
[04:14:43.100 --> 04:14:45.120]  and then you do the full
[04:14:45.120 --> 04:14:46.680]  10, I will get half your coins.
[04:14:47.980 --> 04:14:48.980]  Is it worth the risk?
[04:14:49.520 --> 04:14:50.560]  Ooh.
[04:14:53.160 --> 04:14:55.240]  You've already got double anybody else's
[04:14:55.240 --> 04:14:56.160]  stars.
[04:14:56.380 --> 04:14:59.600]  I don't think Nick having any coins is going to mean
[04:14:59.600 --> 04:15:01.640]  anything to anyone, but yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[04:15:01.840 --> 04:15:02.860]  I might get a coin star.
[04:15:03.740 --> 04:15:05.680]  Here's what I might do.
[04:15:06.580 --> 04:15:07.620]  I'll roll
[04:15:07.620 --> 04:15:09.620]  low next turn, eek my way to
[04:15:09.620 --> 04:15:11.500]  Boo, hope that Andrew gets
[04:15:11.500 --> 04:15:13.520]  a star before that, and then
[04:15:13.520 --> 04:15:14.140]  I'll take that one.
[04:15:15.820 --> 04:15:17.160]  That's just vicious.
[04:15:17.160 --> 04:15:18.600]  But I kind of respect it.
[04:15:18.740 --> 04:15:21.380]  I respect the Boo. I did betray you turn 15.
[04:15:21.740 --> 04:15:22.160]  I have a code.
[04:15:23.520 --> 04:15:25.380]  Yeah, I kind of like it
[04:15:25.380 --> 04:15:26.560]  as much as I hate it.
[04:15:27.920 --> 04:15:29.120]  Find out next time
[04:15:29.120 --> 04:15:30.320]  if that actually happens.
[04:15:30.880 --> 04:15:32.640]  Enjoy. Alright, see you tomorrow.
[04:15:32.940 --> 04:15:33.040]  Bye.
[04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:37.040]  Only three
[04:15:37.040 --> 04:15:38.880]  turns left. That's the amount of turns
[04:15:38.880 --> 04:15:39.640]  Dil needs.
[04:15:42.840 --> 04:15:45.140]  new favorite thing proofing these videos
[04:15:45.140 --> 04:15:47.200]  is before you hit the mushroom, Andrew
[04:15:47.200 --> 04:15:48.900]  instead of all the fun stuff, you said
[04:15:48.900 --> 04:15:49.880]  I'm locked in.
[04:15:52.340 --> 04:15:53.260]  Yeah, the audience
[04:15:53.260 --> 04:15:55.280]  noticed that too. Alright, I need a big
[04:15:55.280 --> 04:15:57.400]  roll. Good ol' roll. That's not bad.
[04:15:57.460 --> 04:15:58.480]  Yeah, that's pretty good, dude.
[04:15:58.800 --> 04:15:59.560]  Great roll, Nick.
[04:16:00.580 --> 04:16:02.500]  I'll get a fun item.
[04:16:03.920 --> 04:16:05.100]  Double dice, double dice.
[04:16:05.560 --> 04:16:07.220]  I didn't like
[04:16:07.220 --> 04:16:07.740]  that at all.
[04:16:09.500 --> 04:16:10.960]  Maybe you'll get a...
[04:16:10.960 --> 04:16:12.260]  Okay, that's nice.
[04:16:12.260 --> 04:16:14.300]  Look at all the money you'll get.
[04:16:15.380 --> 04:16:17.140]  I need a three.
[04:16:19.740 --> 04:16:21.300]  You can slow down Dilkong.
[04:16:22.320 --> 04:16:24.100]  Why wouldn't you slow down me?
[04:16:26.420 --> 04:16:28.200]  I'm just kind of putting ideas out there, dude.
[04:16:28.240 --> 04:16:29.240]  I'm not saying to do it.
[04:16:29.800 --> 04:16:30.500]  I'd love a hamper.
[04:16:32.320 --> 04:16:33.600]  That's not what I thought you were going to say.
[04:16:34.240 --> 04:16:36.080]  Hey, look, another double dice.
[04:16:37.180 --> 04:16:38.300]  Probably going to get rid of
[04:16:38.300 --> 04:16:39.260]  the creepy, I assume.
[04:16:39.660 --> 04:16:41.000]  Not only do you have too many
[04:16:41.000 --> 04:16:42.920]  items, you don't have enough terms to use them.
[04:16:43.260 --> 04:16:43.580]  Exactly.
[04:16:46.160 --> 04:16:47.380]  Just keep it for a
[04:16:47.380 --> 04:16:48.180]  situational use.
[04:16:48.920 --> 04:16:49.800]  What's Gavin going to do?
[04:16:50.820 --> 04:16:52.280]  What's he doing here?
[04:16:52.740 --> 04:16:55.120]  I'm not allowed to look at the board, so I'll just roll
[04:16:55.120 --> 04:16:55.680]  a dice.
[04:16:57.440 --> 04:16:58.540]  You do like that?
[04:16:59.280 --> 04:17:00.140]  I love it.
[04:17:01.300 --> 04:17:03.240]  Okay. Is that good or bad?
[04:17:04.740 --> 04:17:05.120]  Good.
[04:17:05.400 --> 04:17:06.880]  Of course it's good. It's always fucking good.
[04:17:06.880 --> 04:17:07.900]  It's always goddamn good.
[04:17:10.140 --> 04:17:10.940]  Because I want to see
[04:17:10.940 --> 04:17:11.980]  if there's going to be, you know,
[04:17:12.480 --> 04:17:13.840]  new stars to steal.
[04:17:14.960 --> 04:17:16.720]  Oh, I see. It's true, that's smart.
[04:17:17.820 --> 04:17:18.280]  Well, DK.
[04:17:18.380 --> 04:17:19.220]  I just need a four.
[04:17:20.820 --> 04:17:22.280]  First we're going to fucking...
[04:17:23.360 --> 04:17:24.840]  Oh, I'm putting my trap down.
[04:17:25.180 --> 04:17:26.360]  Y'all better watch out.
[04:17:26.720 --> 04:17:26.980]  Uh-huh.
[04:17:28.400 --> 04:17:30.000]  This whole row is traps.
[04:17:31.940 --> 04:17:33.000]  That no one's landed on.
[04:17:33.320 --> 04:17:34.680]  And also, no one's going to go to
[04:17:34.680 --> 04:17:35.620]  after he gets the star.
[04:17:36.960 --> 04:17:37.860]  We can put it behind?
[04:17:39.620 --> 04:17:40.460]  Well, it's for Geoff.
[04:17:41.040 --> 04:17:42.520]  I'm trying to get the people behind me.
[04:17:42.880 --> 04:17:44.940]  Geoff's not going to go this way.
[04:17:45.800 --> 04:17:46.800]  I mean, one of us might.
[04:17:47.400 --> 04:17:48.580]  More than four, more than four, more than four.
[04:17:49.100 --> 04:17:49.820]  Woo-hoo-hoo!
[04:17:50.500 --> 04:17:50.820]  Oh.
[04:17:53.040 --> 04:17:53.360]  Oh.
[04:17:53.440 --> 04:17:56.300]  Oh, it's looking up for the
[04:17:56.960 --> 04:17:57.280]  dillionaires.
[04:17:57.980 --> 04:18:00.000]  This is why you need to put the creepy block on him, dude.
[04:18:00.000 --> 04:18:01.460]  You gotta slow this guy down, Nick.
[04:18:02.060 --> 04:18:03.200]  Well, now I have it.
[04:18:03.560 --> 04:18:04.900]  Bam! And now it's worthless.
[04:18:07.040 --> 04:18:07.560]  That's cool.
[04:18:07.620 --> 04:18:09.160]  We haven't seen that image in a long time.
[04:18:09.480 --> 04:18:10.720]  Donkey Kong next to a star.
[04:18:11.600 --> 04:18:17.440]  Hey, where could it be? There it is.
[04:18:17.520 --> 04:18:18.060]  Oh, wow.
[04:18:19.320 --> 04:18:20.700]  You got a chance time coming up, Dale.
[04:18:23.680 --> 04:18:24.460]  I do.
[04:18:25.460 --> 04:18:26.000]  All right.
[04:18:27.360 --> 04:18:28.960]  All right, money.
[04:18:28.960 --> 04:18:29.840]  What are we going to do?
[04:18:30.160 --> 04:18:32.340]  Twenty-one. Let's go ahead and do that.
[04:18:34.060 --> 04:18:35.200]  Oh, go ahead and roll.
[04:18:35.560 --> 04:18:36.360]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[04:18:36.720 --> 04:18:38.020]  This is the move, Geoff.
[04:18:38.740 --> 04:18:39.540]  Go ahead and roll.
[04:18:39.800 --> 04:18:40.840]  Two tens right here.
[04:18:41.320 --> 04:18:41.640]  Ten, ten.
[04:18:41.820 --> 04:18:42.220]  One.
[04:18:45.280 --> 04:18:45.680]  Double!
[04:18:47.860 --> 04:18:49.660]  Look at Monty Mole's face.
[04:18:49.760 --> 04:18:50.540]  Look at his eyes.
[04:18:53.400 --> 04:18:54.880]  Can somebody make that an emote
[04:18:54.880 --> 04:18:55.580]  for us, please?
[04:18:55.580 --> 04:18:56.940]  It's like...
[04:18:56.940 --> 04:18:59.600]  It looks like the mole's trying to read the text
[04:18:59.600 --> 04:19:01.240]  up front. He's behind it, so it's
[04:19:01.240 --> 04:19:01.980]  backwards.
[04:19:02.520 --> 04:19:05.380]  He's like, surely not.
[04:19:06.340 --> 04:19:07.320]  You got two.
[04:19:08.280 --> 04:19:08.780]  Big roll.
[04:19:09.000 --> 04:19:10.400]  No whammy. Sweet.
[04:19:11.600 --> 04:19:12.160]  Brutal.
[04:19:15.300 --> 04:19:17.500]  Still got 19 to go to get to that fucker.
[04:19:19.160 --> 04:19:20.260]  No double dice.
[04:19:20.840 --> 04:19:21.740]  Getting real excited.
[04:19:21.740 --> 04:19:22.260]  Oh!
[04:19:24.180 --> 04:19:25.120]  Oh, Christ.
[04:19:25.640 --> 04:19:27.700]  Double, just
[04:19:27.700 --> 04:19:28.460]  coin game.
[04:19:29.680 --> 04:19:31.280]  Platform peril, platform.
[04:19:32.220 --> 04:19:32.880]  That's my favorite.
[04:19:34.580 --> 04:19:35.080]  You just run.
[04:19:35.320 --> 04:19:35.880]  Shit.
[04:19:37.660 --> 04:19:39.920]  Just hit start and don't fuck up.
[04:19:40.100 --> 04:19:41.880]  Grab coins. You just go and you grab coins.
[04:19:42.980 --> 04:19:43.700]  Get all them coins.
[04:19:44.620 --> 04:19:45.960]  Coins, that's my
[04:19:45.960 --> 04:19:46.540]  favorite.
[04:19:46.540 --> 04:19:48.540]  Oh, no!
[04:19:51.720 --> 04:19:52.360]  I have my phone!
[04:19:52.760 --> 04:19:53.680]  You piece of shit!
[04:19:53.980 --> 04:19:55.220]  You piece of shit!
[04:19:55.820 --> 04:19:56.500]  You Wario!
[04:19:59.680 --> 04:20:01.060]  Oh, no!
[04:20:01.300 --> 04:20:01.920]  Nick, be careful.
[04:20:03.260 --> 04:20:04.100]  Nick, you're going fast.
[04:20:04.660 --> 04:20:06.120]  I was trying to jump between
[04:20:06.120 --> 04:20:07.200]  those two and it didn't let me.
[04:20:08.040 --> 04:20:08.280]  Gavin!
[04:20:09.780 --> 04:20:11.620]  You son of a bitch!
[04:20:12.800 --> 04:20:14.240]  He is such a
[04:20:14.240 --> 04:20:15.020]  scumbag!
[04:20:16.840 --> 04:20:19.440]  You Wario son of a bitch!
[04:20:22.620 --> 04:20:24.640]  I don't even buy it.
[04:20:24.840 --> 04:20:26.660]  I'm not even happy about it.
[04:20:26.660 --> 04:20:27.700]  I don't believe it.
[04:20:32.560 --> 04:20:34.580]  This is the worst.
[04:20:36.720 --> 04:20:38.800]  You piece of shit, Wario.
[04:20:38.800 --> 04:20:40.660]  50 coins!
[04:20:43.660 --> 04:20:44.820]  I'm not even going to get
[04:20:44.820 --> 04:20:46.080]  the coin star!
[04:20:47.780 --> 04:20:48.220]  Unbelievable.
[04:20:50.640 --> 04:20:52.840]  Oh, great! Way to show up
[04:20:52.840 --> 04:20:54.720]  now! Hey, check it out.
[04:20:54.840 --> 04:20:56.340]  Next time it's not even going to be him.
[04:20:57.420 --> 04:20:58.800]  That's true. Maybe he'll be somewhere
[04:20:58.800 --> 04:21:00.780]  it matters, too. Maybe he'll show up
[04:21:00.780 --> 04:21:02.360]  between me and Boo. That'd be phenomenal.
[04:21:04.260 --> 04:21:04.680]  Why?
[04:21:07.280 --> 04:21:08.900]  You gotta go with Geoff on this one.
[04:21:11.060 --> 04:21:12.460]  Great, you can copy items, guys.
[04:21:12.900 --> 04:21:13.880]  Let's take a look at the map.
[04:21:15.600 --> 04:21:16.140]  Hold on.
[04:21:16.660 --> 04:21:17.780]  Stop showing me Yoshi!
[04:21:19.780 --> 04:21:20.640]  Okay, here we go.
[04:21:22.420 --> 04:21:23.040]  Geoff is
[04:21:23.980 --> 04:21:24.780]  still a bit of a
[04:21:24.780 --> 04:21:26.180]  waste in the start. Not going to make it.
[04:21:26.260 --> 04:21:28.780]  Not going to make it this turn. Maybe next turn.
[04:21:29.560 --> 04:21:30.320]  The last turn.
[04:21:30.640 --> 04:21:32.160]  DK, you're coming up to
[04:21:32.160 --> 04:21:33.820]  Danger Alley, as if you roll
[04:21:33.820 --> 04:21:35.560]  a three, you will land on a
[04:21:35.560 --> 04:21:38.060]  give Wario a star, and then you've gotta get
[04:21:38.060 --> 04:21:40.260]  past the three chance spots
[04:21:40.260 --> 04:21:42.120]  to Boo, but there's also lose half
[04:21:42.120 --> 04:21:44.120]  your coins, and then two additional lose
[04:21:44.120 --> 04:21:45.260]  your stars. Great!
[04:21:46.800 --> 04:21:47.200]  Wario!
[04:21:47.800 --> 04:21:50.040]  Let's see. I know you have your exact
[04:21:50.040 --> 04:21:52.120]  dice roll block, so you can get to Boo
[04:21:52.120 --> 04:21:53.240]  if you want. However,
[04:21:54.160 --> 04:21:55.820]  I'm not even going to bother using the creepy die,
[04:21:55.900 --> 04:21:56.980]  because you can just unroll it.
[04:21:57.380 --> 04:21:59.600]  But, if you were to say, I don't know,
[04:21:59.600 --> 04:22:01.060]  take a chance. You could
[04:22:01.600 --> 04:22:03.280]  end up on one of the
[04:22:03.280 --> 04:22:05.160]  event spaces, or
[04:22:05.160 --> 04:22:07.420]  giving a star to Geoff, or
[04:22:07.420 --> 04:22:08.640]  give me half your coins,
[04:22:09.220 --> 04:22:10.580]  and eventually a chance time.
[04:22:11.740 --> 04:22:12.560]  And I'm somewhere.
[04:22:14.200 --> 04:22:15.240]  And Nick!
[04:22:15.820 --> 04:22:17.240]  And Nick's here too.
[04:22:17.660 --> 04:22:19.560]  Wow. Another day in the books.
[04:22:19.660 --> 04:22:21.600]  Only a few turns left. Who's coming
[04:22:21.600 --> 04:22:23.260]  out on top in Mario Party?
[04:22:23.440 --> 04:22:25.140]  Find out as we get more into it tomorrow.
[04:22:25.360 --> 04:22:26.340]  We'll see you then. Bye!
[04:22:26.340 --> 04:22:26.740]  Bye!
[04:22:27.120 --> 04:22:28.500]  Only seven turns left.
[04:22:29.880 --> 04:22:31.740]  Andrew, you're muted. Andrew, you're muted.
[04:22:32.340 --> 04:22:33.120]  Andrew, you're still muted.
[04:22:33.940 --> 04:22:34.600]  Andrew, you're muted.
[04:22:35.400 --> 04:22:36.300]  It's day 29!
[04:22:36.680 --> 04:22:40.640]  Only two turns left.
[04:22:40.680 --> 04:22:41.480]  Oh, it's Rosalina!
[04:22:41.980 --> 04:22:43.000]  She's back.
[04:22:43.840 --> 04:22:45.980]  Right on the finish line. Dude, it's Geoff's girlfriend.
[04:22:47.680 --> 04:22:48.200]  What?
[04:22:49.740 --> 04:22:52.320]  Wow, she's really close
[04:22:52.320 --> 04:22:53.480]  to Gavin for some reason.
[04:22:54.200 --> 04:22:55.200]  Oh, it's Gavin's girlfriend.
[04:22:55.480 --> 04:22:55.980]  Is that true?
[04:22:56.200 --> 04:22:58.240]  I mean, relatively.
[04:22:59.900 --> 04:23:01.680]  Fuck. You're the closest to her
[04:23:01.680 --> 04:23:02.720]  for some reason.
[04:23:03.380 --> 04:23:05.460]  Well, it's Mario time. Let's see how it goes.
[04:23:05.680 --> 04:23:07.000]  Alright, big roll, buddy. Let's go.
[04:23:07.440 --> 04:23:09.860]  Let's just try to make some money while we're at it.
[04:23:10.400 --> 04:23:10.740]  Why not?
[04:23:11.000 --> 04:23:13.400]  You ever roll a three and a two before?
[04:23:13.500 --> 04:23:14.000]  Let's do it.
[04:23:14.200 --> 04:23:15.380]  You going for the coin stuff?
[04:23:17.380 --> 04:23:17.780]  Oh!
[04:23:19.720 --> 04:23:20.120]  Oh!
[04:23:21.340 --> 04:23:22.560]  What a roll!
[04:23:23.180 --> 04:23:25.000]  What a roll!
[04:23:26.900 --> 04:23:27.300]  Oh!
[04:23:27.660 --> 04:23:29.040]  That was huge!
[04:23:29.180 --> 04:23:31.560]  That changes a lot.
[04:23:31.960 --> 04:23:32.440]  Wow.
[04:23:33.820 --> 04:23:35.340]  I mean, you might as well look.
[04:23:36.840 --> 04:23:37.320]  Nope.
[04:23:37.620 --> 04:23:38.560]  Well, yes.
[04:23:39.420 --> 04:23:40.940]  Yeah, but you already have the double dice.
[04:23:41.100 --> 04:23:44.100]  Yeah, but this is going to guarantee me, if I roll well, a boo.
[04:23:44.380 --> 04:23:44.560]  Okay.
[04:23:45.140 --> 04:23:46.640]  There you go.
[04:23:46.640 --> 04:23:47.460]  I mean, trip dice.
[04:23:47.720 --> 04:23:48.020]  Wow.
[04:23:50.380 --> 04:23:52.500]  You guys make fun of me for getting names wrong.
[04:23:52.500 --> 04:23:54.060]  Yeah, right. Okay. Geez, I apologize.
[04:23:55.360 --> 04:23:57.660]  This could be a while.
[04:23:57.820 --> 04:23:59.300]  There you go.
[04:23:59.440 --> 04:24:00.760]  I was scared. I was very scared.
[04:24:01.860 --> 04:24:02.180]  Oh!
[04:24:04.660 --> 04:24:06.660]  Suddenly he has more dice than he knows what to do with.
[04:24:06.660 --> 04:24:08.620]  Yep. Wish I had those a while ago. Just get rid of them.
[04:24:09.220 --> 04:24:09.340]  Yep.
[04:24:11.020 --> 04:24:11.980]  There's one turn left.
[04:24:12.260 --> 04:24:13.040]  It doesn't matter.
[04:24:13.040 --> 04:24:13.900]  It literally doesn't matter.
[04:24:14.140 --> 04:24:16.140]  Double dice.
[04:24:17.560 --> 04:24:18.680]  Alright, why don't you do a Wario.
[04:24:19.760 --> 04:24:20.140]  Okay.
[04:24:20.600 --> 04:24:22.440]  Gavin is looking at the board, guys.
[04:24:23.380 --> 04:24:23.780]  Seven.
[04:24:25.300 --> 04:24:25.700]  Nine.
[04:24:26.980 --> 04:24:27.380]  Ten.
[04:24:28.020 --> 04:24:28.420]  Eleven.
[04:24:30.680 --> 04:24:32.780]  I'm not going to guarantee a chance time landing,
[04:24:32.920 --> 04:24:36.460]  but a lot of the audience didn't want me to throw the entire game away right at the end.
[04:24:36.660 --> 04:24:37.220]  Why not? Do it.
[04:24:37.360 --> 04:24:38.040]  I might refrain.
[04:24:38.620 --> 04:24:40.300]  Just roll a lovely little nine.
[04:24:40.940 --> 04:24:41.720]  Oh, yeah?
[04:24:42.620 --> 04:24:43.800]  Where's that going to take you?
[04:24:44.220 --> 04:24:45.640]  You and what dice block?
[04:24:46.400 --> 04:24:47.300]  This one.
[04:24:47.380 --> 04:24:48.200]  Oh, shit.
[04:24:50.220 --> 04:24:51.300]  Here we go.
[04:24:52.100 --> 04:24:53.100]  Wait, can I count right?
[04:24:53.340 --> 04:24:55.380]  Just do it.
[04:24:55.900 --> 04:24:56.760]  You said seven.
[04:24:56.980 --> 04:24:57.860]  No, I think you said eight.
[04:25:00.420 --> 04:25:02.080]  Here we go!
[04:25:02.500 --> 04:25:03.220]  God, please be wrong.
[04:25:03.220 --> 04:25:04.800]  Please be wrong.
[04:25:05.560 --> 04:25:06.480]  Oh, shit.
[04:25:07.100 --> 04:25:07.980]  Please be wrong.
[04:25:08.480 --> 04:25:09.300]  Please be wrong.
[04:25:09.400 --> 04:25:11.740]  Please be wrong.
[04:25:11.960 --> 04:25:14.180]  Yeah, I mean, no hesitation.
[04:25:14.580 --> 04:25:15.380]  No hesitation.
[04:25:16.640 --> 04:25:18.460]  No, didn't even wait.
[04:25:18.960 --> 04:25:19.820]  Didn't think about it.
[04:25:20.200 --> 04:25:21.400]  Didn't look at where the board was.
[04:25:21.620 --> 04:25:22.560]  Just taken away from you.
[04:25:25.420 --> 04:25:28.120]  This is the guy you made a shadow alliance with, Andrew?
[04:25:28.600 --> 04:25:31.320]  No, it's the guy he broke the shadow alliance with.
[04:25:32.720 --> 04:25:34.000]  Dan, you have to give yourself a star.
[04:25:34.000 --> 04:25:34.920]  I will.
[04:25:37.660 --> 04:25:40.360]  Well, now you don't have to worry about the danger zones.
[04:25:40.440 --> 04:25:41.260]  Because there's nothing...
[04:25:41.260 --> 04:25:44.580]  Andrew, I'm setting a new danger zone for people.
[04:25:44.840 --> 04:25:46.840]  Oh, yeah, for Geoff to not get to.
[04:25:47.600 --> 04:25:47.780]  Yep.
[04:25:48.660 --> 04:25:49.240]  There you go.
[04:25:51.700 --> 04:25:52.180]  Great.
[04:25:52.900 --> 04:25:53.560]  Oh, no!
[04:25:54.280 --> 04:25:56.280]  Geoff rolled two ones on double die.
[04:25:57.880 --> 04:25:58.460]  Not yet.
[04:25:58.520 --> 04:25:59.440]  I'm not too worried about that.
[04:26:00.000 --> 04:26:01.660]  This is interesting.
[04:26:01.660 --> 04:26:02.440]  Pretty good.
[04:26:04.380 --> 04:26:04.820]  Oh!
[04:26:04.820 --> 04:26:05.140]  Oh!
[04:26:07.920 --> 04:26:09.020]  Boy, that was close.
[04:26:10.040 --> 04:26:10.940]  Hi, guys.
[04:26:11.560 --> 04:26:11.920]  Hey, man.
[04:26:12.720 --> 04:26:15.300]  Make sure you use your item, Geoff.
[04:26:15.460 --> 04:26:16.000]  Yeah, put it down.
[04:26:16.320 --> 04:26:18.640]  Maybe you'll get Gavin's coins on the next turn.
[04:26:19.140 --> 04:26:19.640]  You never know.
[04:26:20.960 --> 04:26:21.780]  You never know.
[04:26:22.860 --> 04:26:24.840]  Yeah, let's set it here.
[04:26:25.140 --> 04:26:25.420]  Perfect.
[04:26:26.520 --> 04:26:27.060]  There we go.
[04:26:27.600 --> 04:26:29.140]  It seems like you'd want to put it behind you,
[04:26:29.240 --> 04:26:29.900]  but I like that.
[04:26:33.320 --> 04:26:34.040]  Here we go.
[04:26:35.040 --> 04:26:35.840]  Big roll.
[04:26:37.540 --> 04:26:38.340]  Big roll.
[04:26:38.580 --> 04:26:40.820]  Here we go.
[04:26:41.880 --> 04:26:42.840]  Nope, here we go.
[04:26:43.540 --> 04:26:45.560]  Oh, that actually...
[04:26:45.560 --> 04:26:46.080]  Oh, never mind.
[04:26:46.640 --> 04:26:48.060]  Booyah! Way to go, buddy.
[04:26:48.880 --> 04:26:50.540]  Six coins for the mole.
[04:26:51.600 --> 04:26:52.600]  You get to stop at the shop.
[04:26:53.520 --> 04:26:55.320]  Our second-to-last minigame, guys.
[04:26:55.320 --> 04:26:56.780]  We're ready to wrap this thing in.
[04:26:56.860 --> 04:26:58.500]  That is crazy. We're so close.
[04:26:58.520 --> 04:27:00.400]  I'm looking for some wins.
[04:27:01.240 --> 04:27:03.060]  I can't believe we've done it almost.
[04:27:03.660 --> 04:27:04.400]  Stamp out.
[04:27:05.600 --> 04:27:06.760]  Thanks to some information,
[04:27:07.060 --> 04:27:07.960]  I've learned it's vital for me to win.
[04:27:07.960 --> 04:27:08.820]  This is a must-win.
[04:27:10.620 --> 04:27:13.080]  This is a must-win, or Nick and I both have to lose.
[04:27:13.980 --> 04:27:14.280]  Uh-oh.
[04:27:16.000 --> 04:27:17.620]  Okay, Gavin, you know what you have to do.
[04:27:18.520 --> 04:27:18.920]  Do I?
[04:27:19.200 --> 04:27:19.920]  What does that mean?
[04:27:20.040 --> 04:27:20.600]  Cover DK.
[04:27:21.340 --> 04:27:22.120]  Oh, yeah.
[04:27:22.440 --> 04:27:23.460]  That's fucked up.
[04:27:24.820 --> 04:27:27.220]  I'm afraid you broke the shadow alliance.
[04:27:29.560 --> 04:27:30.580]  Yeah, but you...
[04:27:30.580 --> 04:27:32.100]  He broke your alliance.
[04:27:32.740 --> 04:27:33.940]  Time to go, boys. What you got?
[04:27:34.440 --> 04:27:36.420]  The mole taking over DK.
[04:27:37.080 --> 04:27:38.140]  Oh, you're a piece of shit, Gavin.
[04:27:38.140 --> 04:27:39.140]  Taking over to Wario.
[04:27:40.260 --> 04:27:41.180]  Wario taking over Wario.
[04:27:41.180 --> 04:27:42.620]  I just had to get around. You were in my way.
[04:27:45.160 --> 04:27:45.640]  Ooh.
[04:27:46.780 --> 04:27:47.700]  Mario's move.
[04:27:47.700 --> 04:27:48.900]  What's Mario thinking?
[04:27:49.160 --> 04:27:51.720]  Oh, Mario might be losing this one. This could be it.
[04:27:52.300 --> 04:27:53.340]  Gotta figure it out.
[04:27:53.460 --> 04:27:54.820]  The mole is making moves.
[04:27:54.900 --> 04:27:56.540]  Here comes Mario. Big moves.
[04:27:57.000 --> 04:27:58.740]  Making mole moves, baby.
[04:27:59.400 --> 04:28:00.320]  It might be Wario.
[04:28:00.700 --> 04:28:01.980]  I think it's Wario.
[04:28:04.060 --> 04:28:05.180]  Yes! Oh, yeah!
[04:28:06.700 --> 04:28:07.780]  Okay, that's fine.
[04:28:07.980 --> 04:28:08.680]  I'll take it.
[04:28:08.900 --> 04:28:10.560]  It comes down to tomorrow.
[04:28:12.120 --> 04:28:12.640]  Tomorrow.
[04:28:13.580 --> 04:28:13.800]  Oh!
[04:28:13.800 --> 04:28:14.140]  Oh!
[04:28:16.180 --> 04:28:17.440]  To Mario's party.
[04:28:19.180 --> 04:28:20.140]  Seven stars.
[04:28:21.240 --> 04:28:21.480]  Seven.
[04:28:22.040 --> 04:28:23.120]  Three stars.
[04:28:23.540 --> 04:28:24.920]  Does third place count as a win?
[04:28:25.960 --> 04:28:26.980]  Andrew, I have a
[04:28:28.400 --> 04:28:29.360]  small ask.
[04:28:29.800 --> 04:28:30.620]  Oh, here it is.
[04:28:31.020 --> 04:28:32.640]  Could you not steal my star tomorrow?
[04:28:33.060 --> 04:28:35.500]  Oh, you mean one of my three stars that you have?
[04:28:36.600 --> 04:28:38.120]  I've become fond of them.
[04:28:38.120 --> 04:28:39.980]  Should I not steal one of my three stars that you own?
[04:28:40.320 --> 04:28:41.060]  What about my three?
[04:28:41.060 --> 04:28:42.220]  He has my three as well.
[04:28:42.560 --> 04:28:44.400]  I think take back is the correct word.
[04:28:44.540 --> 04:28:46.120]  You should take one of Nick's.
[04:28:46.120 --> 04:28:47.760]  No, you shouldn't!
[04:28:48.420 --> 04:28:51.200]  If you take one from him
[04:28:51.200 --> 04:28:52.960]  tomorrow, I will also take one
[04:28:52.960 --> 04:28:53.900]  from him tomorrow.
[04:28:55.280 --> 04:28:57.080]  Oh, now that's interesting.
[04:28:57.600 --> 04:28:58.480]  It's all gonna change.
[04:28:58.480 --> 04:28:59.960]  I'm gonna take one from Gavin regardless.
[04:29:00.700 --> 04:29:02.320]  Nick, why don't you take Geoff's?
[04:29:02.920 --> 04:29:04.040]  No, here's what we'll do.
[04:29:04.860 --> 04:29:07.380]  Nick, you take one. Andrew, you take one.
[04:29:07.440 --> 04:29:08.600]  Then I'll take one.
[04:29:08.600 --> 04:29:10.520]  Then he'll have four.
[04:29:10.720 --> 04:29:11.920]  Can you get to Boo?
[04:29:12.140 --> 04:29:12.860]  How are you gonna do that?
[04:29:13.660 --> 04:29:15.000]  I'll figure it out.
[04:29:15.780 --> 04:29:17.180]  He's got it. I believe in him.
[04:29:17.900 --> 04:29:19.200]  How's the board looking, Nick?
[04:29:19.420 --> 04:29:22.360]  What if you take each other's stars?
[04:29:22.820 --> 04:29:23.680]  Andrew and Nick.
[04:29:24.060 --> 04:29:25.980]  Hey, I got an idea too. Why don't you go fuck yourself?
[04:29:26.500 --> 04:29:27.920]  What's the board looking like?
[04:29:28.060 --> 04:29:30.400]  Oh, the board looks fantastic!
[04:29:30.680 --> 04:29:32.640]  I'm five to the star and just a little bit
[04:29:32.640 --> 04:29:35.020]  away from Boo and I got three blocks
[04:29:35.020 --> 04:29:35.960]  to get there.
[04:29:35.960 --> 04:29:38.040]  DK, two away from Boo
[04:29:38.040 --> 04:29:39.420]  but entering the danger zone.
[04:29:39.740 --> 04:29:42.060]  He could land on... Oh, I don't know.
[04:29:42.200 --> 04:29:44.200]  Give Wario a star. Give Monty Mole a star.
[04:29:44.680 --> 04:29:45.820]  Give me half his coins.
[04:29:46.220 --> 04:29:47.140]  He could get a chance.
[04:29:47.860 --> 04:29:49.500]  He could also get to Bowser.
[04:29:49.920 --> 04:29:51.500]  He's in fucked territory.
[04:29:52.220 --> 04:29:52.740]  Monty Mole,
[04:29:53.560 --> 04:29:54.840]  you're happy to be here.
[04:29:55.600 --> 04:29:58.000]  Yes, I am. I'm in second place.
[04:29:58.380 --> 04:29:59.720]  Gavin's also in the danger zone.
[04:30:00.200 --> 04:30:01.700]  Hell yeah. It's dangerous.
[04:30:02.300 --> 04:30:03.040]  And then Rosalina.
[04:30:03.040 --> 04:30:03.100]  Yeah.
[04:30:05.580 --> 04:30:06.920]  Maybe. If you roll a ten.
[04:30:08.020 --> 04:30:08.660]  See you tomorrow!
[04:30:08.780 --> 04:30:09.700]  Big finale tomorrow.
[04:30:10.920 --> 04:30:12.620]  One turn left.
[04:30:12.780 --> 04:30:14.260]  Who's gonna take it home?
[04:30:14.500 --> 04:30:17.080]  Can Gavin secure this lead with seven stars?
[04:30:17.300 --> 04:30:19.080]  Can't wait to see it. There's only one way to find out
[04:30:19.080 --> 04:30:20.740]  and that's watching the last episode
[04:30:20.740 --> 04:30:22.780]  of Mario Party March.
[04:30:22.880 --> 04:30:24.960]  Thanks for watching so far and we'll see you tomorrow. Bye!
[04:30:25.340 --> 04:30:25.620]  Bye!
[04:30:26.920 --> 04:30:27.860]  I'm gonna win.
[04:30:28.500 --> 04:30:29.360]  Where's the safe gone?
[04:30:30.200 --> 04:30:30.720]  Oh!
[04:30:31.120 --> 04:30:38.360]  Oh, you little turd.
[04:30:38.440 --> 04:30:40.480]  Mr. Seven Stars ain't losing that save.
[04:30:40.660 --> 04:30:43.840]  We know Gavin's got seven backups
[04:30:43.840 --> 04:30:44.840]  for his seven stars.
[04:30:45.160 --> 04:30:47.200]  The final turn.
[04:30:47.740 --> 04:30:48.900]  Oh my god.
[04:30:49.600 --> 04:30:51.520]  Nick, what you gonna do?
[04:30:51.940 --> 04:30:53.580]  I have so many
[04:30:53.580 --> 04:30:55.520]  options here. There's so many ways
[04:30:55.520 --> 04:30:57.840]  I could play this. I thought a lot about it last night.
[04:30:58.480 --> 04:31:00.300]  I thought a lot about it last night.
[04:31:00.480 --> 04:31:02.120]  So, I could roll
[04:31:02.120 --> 04:31:03.900]  the triple, which would
[04:31:03.900 --> 04:31:05.360]  potentially put me
[04:31:05.360 --> 04:31:07.420]  to boo. Right? Get me the star.
[04:31:07.560 --> 04:31:08.980]  I have no doubt that I'd get to the star.
[04:31:09.260 --> 04:31:11.480]  But I could roll, you know, triple
[04:31:11.480 --> 04:31:13.660]  eyes. The ones.
[04:31:13.960 --> 04:31:14.960]  And end up on...
[04:31:14.960 --> 04:31:17.860]  Not even close to the star. So...
[04:31:17.860 --> 04:31:19.780]  You don't know that. I watched you roll two ones.
[04:31:20.080 --> 04:31:21.680]  It's me. Oh yeah, it'll happen to me.
[04:31:21.760 --> 04:31:23.900]  Not to anybody else. I do that so you guys
[04:31:23.900 --> 04:31:26.080]  don't have to. But I've decided
[04:31:26.080 --> 04:31:28.480]  that even with two stars
[04:31:28.480 --> 04:31:30.200]  in addition to my one.
[04:31:30.280 --> 04:31:32.160]  So three. I don't know if that's gonna do
[04:31:32.160 --> 04:31:34.200]  me any good. But there is a chance time
[04:31:34.200 --> 04:31:35.980]  in the vicinity of one Gavin
[04:31:35.980 --> 04:31:37.580]  free. That's a yikes.
[04:31:38.020 --> 04:31:40.300]  And a star steal trap. There you are,
[04:31:40.340 --> 04:31:42.060]  sir. I now have a
[04:31:42.060 --> 04:31:43.840]  two in three chance of something
[04:31:43.840 --> 04:31:45.500]  shit happening. Very
[04:31:46.060 --> 04:31:48.040]  interesting move. Very interesting
[04:31:48.040 --> 04:31:50.200]  move. And I'll have to rely on my own
[04:31:50.200 --> 04:31:51.160]  roll ability.
[04:31:51.760 --> 04:31:52.280]  Wow!
[04:31:52.280 --> 04:31:53.060]  He's done it!
[04:31:53.740 --> 04:31:55.880]  The minimum of what you needed.
[04:31:56.240 --> 04:31:58.200]  He trusted the heart of the cards,
[04:31:58.280 --> 04:32:00.040]  guys. Nick, the perfect
[04:32:00.040 --> 04:32:02.160]  turn. Yeah, it
[04:32:02.160 --> 04:32:03.660]  worked out so well.
[04:32:04.060 --> 04:32:05.860]  I'm gonna restart my switch real quick.
[04:32:06.000 --> 04:32:06.720]  No, hold on. Stop.
[04:32:10.260 --> 04:32:12.000]  Now Gavin, you've got nothing to counter
[04:32:12.000 --> 04:32:13.960]  this creepy dice block. I have no
[04:32:13.960 --> 04:32:15.900]  items. I will have to roll this
[04:32:15.900 --> 04:32:17.800]  turd of a dice. That was the other
[04:32:17.800 --> 04:32:19.480]  thing that played into my decision.
[04:32:19.480 --> 04:32:20.280]  Be careful.
[04:32:21.180 --> 04:32:22.820]  Andrew put a star steal down there.
[04:32:23.120 --> 04:32:25.340]  Two of them. Two of them, Eric. They gotta
[04:32:25.340 --> 04:32:27.960]  watch out. You guys have to be careful.
[04:32:28.580 --> 04:32:29.800]  Alright, boys, here it is.
[04:32:30.160 --> 04:32:31.260]  So what do we need? We need a three?
[04:32:31.740 --> 04:32:33.440]  A three would
[04:32:33.440 --> 04:32:34.680]  be horrific.
[04:32:35.520 --> 04:32:36.800]  Three. Three. Three.
[04:32:37.700 --> 04:32:39.400]  Please. So what I wanna do
[04:32:40.140 --> 04:32:41.440]  is just roll the
[04:32:41.440 --> 04:32:41.840]  two.
[04:32:43.280 --> 04:32:45.160]  If you roll a two, that's gonna be
[04:32:45.160 --> 04:32:47.500]  anything but a two. Literally anything
[04:32:47.500 --> 04:32:48.860]  but two. What's up, universe?
[04:32:49.600 --> 04:32:50.000]  Yes!
[04:32:52.360 --> 04:32:53.260]  Oh, I'll take that.
[04:32:54.220 --> 04:32:55.540]  Geoff didn't even know what he was getting.
[04:32:55.660 --> 04:32:57.300]  That's great. Geoff, there's your star back, son.
[04:32:57.600 --> 04:32:59.380]  Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it.
[04:33:01.500 --> 04:33:03.240]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[04:33:03.720 --> 04:33:05.000]  Oh, a little bit of parody on there.
[04:33:05.100 --> 04:33:07.500]  If Geoff gets all the bonus stars...
[04:33:08.760 --> 04:33:09.560]  You know
[04:33:09.560 --> 04:33:10.240]  that's not gonna happen.
[04:33:10.700 --> 04:33:13.780]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:33:14.260 --> 04:33:15.000]  Yeah, definitely do that.
[04:33:15.000 --> 04:33:17.120]  Bonus stars is being played
[04:33:17.120 --> 04:33:18.300]  right now. Got to.
[04:33:19.160 --> 04:33:20.640]  I'm gonna be down at five.
[04:33:22.680 --> 04:33:24.460]  I think that's the right space, yeah.
[04:33:25.020 --> 04:33:26.000]  Yeah, sure.
[04:33:26.620 --> 04:33:28.900]  Yeah, he's got it. Let me look at the board
[04:33:28.900 --> 04:33:30.140]  really quickly and see
[04:33:30.140 --> 04:33:32.800]  what I need. One, two, three, four,
[04:33:32.900 --> 04:33:33.700]  five, six, seven.
[04:33:35.340 --> 04:33:37.220]  Yeah, I'm seven away from the chance
[04:33:37.220 --> 04:33:39.160]  time. So let's get a
[04:33:39.160 --> 04:33:40.800]  nice lucky number seven
[04:33:40.800 --> 04:33:42.740]  for the Dilkongs out there.
[04:33:42.740 --> 04:33:43.760]  No!
[04:33:44.520 --> 04:33:46.700]  Oh no, Bowser! Oh no!
[04:33:47.980 --> 04:33:48.240]  Oh!
[04:33:49.000 --> 04:33:49.780]  Very interesting.
[04:33:50.000 --> 04:33:50.700]  Oh, interesting.
[04:33:52.780 --> 04:33:53.860]  No hesitation.
[04:33:53.860 --> 04:33:56.500]  Gonna go straight for Gavin. Interesting.
[04:33:57.640 --> 04:33:59.080]  Very interesting play.
[04:33:59.280 --> 04:33:59.780]  No hesitation.
[04:34:00.420 --> 04:34:02.760]  If Geoff wins this, I'll be so happy.
[04:34:03.140 --> 04:34:03.620]  Me too.
[04:34:05.880 --> 04:34:06.100]  Huh.
[04:34:06.420 --> 04:34:08.760]  Watch as Geoff is gonna lose because he lands
[04:34:08.760 --> 04:34:10.040]  on a Gibbs star to you.
[04:34:10.040 --> 04:34:12.320]  I still have my turn
[04:34:12.320 --> 04:34:13.780]  to fuck things up, don't you know?
[04:34:14.080 --> 04:34:15.540]  I got it.
[04:34:16.940 --> 04:34:17.360]  Interesting.
[04:34:18.260 --> 04:34:19.660]  Is there a steal a star button?
[04:34:19.780 --> 04:34:20.960]  Because that would be very funny.
[04:34:23.060 --> 04:34:24.220]  Oh, he can steal
[04:34:24.220 --> 04:34:24.680]  your star.
[04:34:26.880 --> 04:34:27.720]  Oh, awesome!
[04:34:28.240 --> 04:34:29.520]  If I go back to back turns,
[04:34:29.800 --> 04:34:31.100]  get a star, lose a star?
[04:34:31.960 --> 04:34:33.300]  All players lose ten.
[04:34:34.040 --> 04:34:35.480]  Get a hundred stars, dude. That'd be cool.
[04:34:35.500 --> 04:34:37.180]  Yeah, dude. Win it for us.
[04:34:37.180 --> 04:34:37.520]  Yeah.
[04:34:38.920 --> 04:34:39.960]  Oh, no!
[04:34:40.800 --> 04:34:41.620]  Oh, coins.
[04:34:42.880 --> 04:34:44.920]  Everyone kind of has equal amounts as his.
[04:34:45.040 --> 04:34:46.860]  It's not gonna be all that impactful.
[04:34:50.000 --> 04:34:51.000]  I like the game
[04:34:51.000 --> 04:34:52.340]  gives you this in the final turn.
[04:34:53.240 --> 04:34:55.460]  So, there's no coin star,
[04:34:55.600 --> 04:34:56.560]  right, Ben?
[04:34:57.160 --> 04:34:57.920]  Wow, he's rich.
[04:34:59.200 --> 04:35:01.460]  Sometimes the coin star is who had the most
[04:35:01.460 --> 04:35:03.120]  at any point, but I don't know
[04:35:03.120 --> 04:35:04.900]  if it's what it is in this game.
[04:35:04.900 --> 04:35:07.220]  You get land on a blue space, and then I'll have the most.
[04:35:07.680 --> 04:35:09.200]  Oh, shit. I didn't think about that.
[04:35:10.000 --> 04:35:10.800]  Watch as you land on a red.
[04:35:10.800 --> 04:35:11.440]  There is a mini-game.
[04:35:12.700 --> 04:35:14.020]  There is a mini-game.
[04:35:14.100 --> 04:35:15.300]  Oh, there's a mini-game.
[04:35:16.900 --> 04:35:17.620]  Pretty cool.
[04:35:19.680 --> 04:35:20.500]  Alright, Geoff.
[04:35:20.680 --> 04:35:22.740]  Monty Mole, let's see what we have.
[04:35:22.860 --> 04:35:23.520]  Alright, I have
[04:35:26.420 --> 04:35:27.140]  zero items
[04:35:27.140 --> 04:35:28.740]  to use. I have fourteen to go
[04:35:28.740 --> 04:35:30.480]  to get to the dice. Now, the maximum
[04:35:30.480 --> 04:35:32.120]  I can roll is a ten.
[04:35:32.120 --> 04:35:34.320]  So, I'm gonna come up four short.
[04:35:35.400 --> 04:35:35.920]  Heartbreaker.
[04:35:37.380 --> 04:35:38.420]  Yeah, but...
[04:35:38.420 --> 04:35:39.400]  Uh-oh.
[04:35:40.600 --> 04:35:43.940]  Okay, you avoided the trowel.
[04:35:46.720 --> 04:35:47.760]  Take it.
[04:35:48.460 --> 04:35:50.200]  And a 1v3 final mini-game
[04:35:50.200 --> 04:35:51.500]  in which I need to beat Nick.
[04:35:52.780 --> 04:35:54.080]  Guys, we have to
[04:35:54.080 --> 04:35:56.200]  kill Dilkong. This determines
[04:35:56.200 --> 04:35:58.220]  the mini-game star if my math is correct
[04:35:58.220 --> 04:35:59.820]  and it probably isn't.
[04:36:00.320 --> 04:36:01.480]  Unfriendly flying object.
[04:36:01.620 --> 04:36:02.400]  What is this one?
[04:36:03.680 --> 04:36:05.780]  We have to beat Dilkong.
[04:36:05.960 --> 04:36:07.640]  Oh, shit.
[04:36:07.760 --> 04:36:09.080]  This one's pretty rough.
[04:36:10.380 --> 04:36:11.860]  You just gotta not be an idiot.
[04:36:12.340 --> 04:36:13.640]  Oh, I jumped on. Okay.
[04:36:13.960 --> 04:36:15.640]  We can't hurt each other. That's good to know.
[04:36:16.120 --> 04:36:16.880]  We can or cannot?
[04:36:17.440 --> 04:36:19.660]  We can squish each other.
[04:36:19.900 --> 04:36:22.140]  And also emotionally, too.
[04:36:22.860 --> 04:36:23.460]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[04:36:24.660 --> 04:36:25.060]  Oh, okay.
[04:36:25.760 --> 04:36:27.260]  That's real bad. Oh, sorry.
[04:36:32.840 --> 04:36:33.960]  Oh, no.
[04:36:34.460 --> 04:36:35.620]  I think we won.
[04:36:37.760 --> 04:36:38.320]  No!
[04:36:40.260 --> 04:36:40.960]  I'm trapped.
[04:36:41.300 --> 04:36:42.840]  I think Nick's safe.
[04:36:43.540 --> 04:36:45.620]  No, well, Gavin was safe a minute ago.
[04:36:45.780 --> 04:36:47.140]  Just stay on that side, Geoff.
[04:36:47.260 --> 04:36:47.880]  Stay alive.
[04:36:48.920 --> 04:36:51.320]  Geoff, okay. Geoff, run!
[04:36:51.900 --> 04:36:52.220]  No!
[04:36:53.860 --> 04:36:54.860]  Yes, Geoff!
[04:36:55.220 --> 04:36:56.100]  Yes, Geoff!
[04:36:56.980 --> 04:36:57.260]  Yes!
[04:36:58.140 --> 04:36:58.620]  Oh!
[04:37:00.180 --> 04:37:01.180]  I'm really proud
[04:37:01.180 --> 04:37:02.160]  of Mr. Monty Mole.
[04:37:04.100 --> 04:37:04.760]  This is it.
[04:37:04.760 --> 04:37:06.680]  This is it for all of us.
[04:37:06.780 --> 04:37:07.860]  This is the finale.
[04:37:08.220 --> 04:37:10.380]  30 days, it all comes down to this.
[04:37:10.760 --> 04:37:11.980]  30 turns.
[04:37:12.660 --> 04:37:15.440]  That can only be one superstar.
[04:37:16.580 --> 04:37:17.280]  I got the reference.
[04:37:18.300 --> 04:37:18.960]  Thanks, bud.
[04:37:19.720 --> 04:37:19.800]  Yeah.
[04:37:20.560 --> 04:37:21.040]  Oh!
[04:37:22.940 --> 04:37:25.220]  Oh, this is gonna be fun to see my decline.
[04:37:25.220 --> 04:37:26.360]  This is gonna be insane.
[04:37:27.860 --> 04:37:29.060]  Turn 15.
[04:37:29.280 --> 04:37:30.820]  Things are looking so good.
[04:37:32.760 --> 04:37:33.620]  Look at this.
[04:37:33.740 --> 04:37:34.300]  First star.
[04:37:35.500 --> 04:37:35.760]  Okay.
[04:37:38.340 --> 04:37:39.180]  Monty Mole.
[04:37:39.920 --> 04:37:40.740]  That was fun.
[04:37:42.360 --> 04:37:43.460]  And then it never
[04:37:43.460 --> 04:37:44.420]  recovered from there.
[04:37:47.660 --> 04:37:49.260]  Dead. Just flatlined.
[04:37:49.600 --> 04:37:50.540]  I just flatlined.
[04:37:51.920 --> 04:37:53.360]  Look at that green line
[04:37:53.360 --> 04:37:53.880]  to the bottom.
[04:37:54.760 --> 04:37:57.340]  Just death from the point of betraying you.
[04:37:59.500 --> 04:38:01.240]  Unplug him. There's no signs of life.
[04:38:01.400 --> 04:38:01.740]  Uh-huh.
[04:38:02.720 --> 04:38:03.600]  Alright, here we go.
[04:38:03.980 --> 04:38:05.920]  Oh, God.
[04:38:07.440 --> 04:38:07.920]  Oh!
[04:38:08.800 --> 04:38:09.700]  This could be anyone.
[04:38:10.080 --> 04:38:12.000]  Who made off with the most coins.
[04:38:13.440 --> 04:38:14.700]  Seems like it should be...
[04:38:14.700 --> 04:38:15.080]  Yes!
[04:38:15.940 --> 04:38:19.520]  Me probably giving 67 to him in that duel
[04:38:19.520 --> 04:38:20.900]  didn't help, I would imagine.
[04:38:20.900 --> 04:38:23.220]  I may have played the wrong hand.
[04:38:24.120 --> 04:38:24.700]  Second bonus.
[04:38:25.880 --> 04:38:27.420]  That might be Dilkong.
[04:38:30.760 --> 04:38:32.480]  Is there a dumbest rolls?
[04:38:32.680 --> 04:38:33.100]  That's me!
[04:38:34.680 --> 04:38:36.240]  Get me on the board again.
[04:38:38.020 --> 04:38:39.060]  Oh, the best hope
[04:38:39.060 --> 04:38:40.660]  now is that Geoff gets one star here.
[04:38:41.440 --> 04:38:42.520]  Oh, what could it be?
[04:38:42.960 --> 04:38:43.760]  I think this is me.
[04:38:44.880 --> 04:38:45.760]  I think this is also me.
[04:38:46.400 --> 04:38:48.820]  Didn't you land on event spaces the first four turns?
[04:38:48.820 --> 04:38:50.580]  That was me, but I think...
[04:38:50.580 --> 04:38:52.120]  That's Gavin then.
[04:38:52.680 --> 04:38:54.360]  Oh, three-way tie!
[04:38:54.860 --> 04:38:55.040]  Yes!
[04:38:56.080 --> 04:38:56.480]  Wow!
[04:38:59.100 --> 04:38:59.660]  Wow!
[04:39:00.960 --> 04:39:01.460]  Wow.
[04:39:01.840 --> 04:39:04.360]  Well, congratulations, Gavin!
[04:39:04.900 --> 04:39:05.660]  Who will it be?
[04:39:06.200 --> 04:39:07.700]  Well, we don't know. Who will it be?
[04:39:07.780 --> 04:39:08.320]  We gotta see.
[04:39:09.660 --> 04:39:12.620]  Could have gone tits up for me at the end.
[04:39:13.560 --> 04:39:14.020]  Yes!
[04:39:14.220 --> 04:39:14.420]  Wow!
[04:39:14.420 --> 04:39:15.160]  Interesting.
[04:39:16.220 --> 04:39:18.520]  Okay, I'll take March
[04:39:18.520 --> 04:39:20.200]  2025. Congratulations,
[04:39:20.780 --> 04:39:21.120]  Gavin!
[04:39:22.440 --> 04:39:24.480]  You are the winner of Mario
[04:39:24.480 --> 04:39:25.720]  Party March.
[04:39:26.560 --> 04:39:28.500]  And as we discussed, I don't know if you were
[04:39:28.500 --> 04:39:30.580]  here when we discussed it, but the winner gives each
[04:39:30.580 --> 04:39:32.480]  loser $1,000 in cash.
[04:39:32.920 --> 04:39:33.300]  $1,000!
[04:39:34.880 --> 04:39:36.500]  Let's look at these advanced stats.
[04:39:37.000 --> 04:39:38.640]  Can I get a Greg card for winning?
[04:39:39.200 --> 04:39:39.500]  No.
[04:39:40.220 --> 04:39:42.440]  I'm afraid not. Seems like you should be able to get
[04:39:42.440 --> 04:39:43.100]  something for winning.
[04:39:45.720 --> 04:39:50.400]  Hey, you had a perfectly balanced run,
[04:39:50.700 --> 04:39:50.780]  Geoff.
[04:39:51.180 --> 04:39:54.420]  I won the most mini-games.
[04:39:54.600 --> 04:39:56.240]  Solid second place for Geoff.
[04:39:57.000 --> 04:39:58.560]  You brought a ton of things.
[04:40:00.280 --> 04:40:00.400]  Andrew,
[04:40:00.500 --> 04:40:01.480]  you weren't going for shopping.
[04:40:02.320 --> 04:40:03.960]  That was one of the things I was going for, yeah.
[04:40:04.680 --> 04:40:05.820]  Let's look at these stats.
[04:40:06.540 --> 04:40:06.920]  Wow.
[04:40:09.520 --> 04:40:09.920]  Gavin
[04:40:09.920 --> 04:40:11.420]  landed on 18 blue
[04:40:11.420 --> 04:40:14.020]  compared to 10 and 12 for Nick and I.
[04:40:15.680 --> 04:40:18.040]  Gavin also landed on the most
[04:40:18.040 --> 04:40:18.700]  luck spaces.
[04:40:20.320 --> 04:40:21.720]  We had four events
[04:40:21.720 --> 04:40:23.600]  spaces split between the three of us.
[04:40:23.860 --> 04:40:25.520]  Number of start. Gavin ended up with
[04:40:25.520 --> 04:40:27.280]  10 start. I had six.
[04:40:27.840 --> 04:40:30.140]  I think I got three of my four
[04:40:30.140 --> 04:40:31.900]  green spaces in the first
[04:40:31.900 --> 04:40:32.940]  three turns of the game.
[04:40:33.380 --> 04:40:35.680]  My math was correct. That stinks. Nick won
[04:40:35.680 --> 04:40:37.740]  with 14 mini-games at the very end.
[04:40:38.320 --> 04:40:38.760]  Wow.
[04:40:39.840 --> 04:40:42.020]  Andrew, you landed on Bowser three times.
[04:40:42.120 --> 04:40:42.660]  Yep, sure did.
[04:40:44.340 --> 04:40:45.780]  I had 10 stars.
[04:40:45.920 --> 04:40:47.440]  I bought one more item than everybody else.
[04:40:47.920 --> 04:40:49.160]  You had 10 stars?
[04:40:49.480 --> 04:40:51.480]  I had eight. I can't believe you
[04:40:51.480 --> 04:40:53.900]  bastards stole four stars.
[04:40:58.300 --> 04:40:58.740]  Interesting.
[04:40:58.760 --> 04:41:01.060]  You have three of mine, you little son of a gun.
[04:41:01.240 --> 04:41:03.860]  That says I have six
[04:41:03.860 --> 04:41:05.900]  on one thing, but on the other it says three.
[04:41:05.900 --> 04:41:06.740]  I don't know what happened.
[04:41:07.460 --> 04:41:08.760]  Where did they go?
[04:41:09.220 --> 04:41:12.220]  I fucking slaughtered you guys on number of reactions
[04:41:12.220 --> 04:41:13.760]  you used. Where's my star for that?
[04:41:13.840 --> 04:41:15.320]  Yeah, you should've got a star for that, dude.
[04:41:15.880 --> 04:41:16.840]  You should've got a star for that.
[04:41:16.920 --> 04:41:19.520]  Well, there you have it, guys.
[04:41:20.000 --> 04:41:21.380]  Mario Party March.
[04:41:21.540 --> 04:41:22.200]  We did it.
[04:41:23.900 --> 04:41:25.860]  Gavin comes away as
[04:41:25.860 --> 04:41:27.520]  the winner with four stars.
[04:41:28.480 --> 04:41:29.360]  141 coins.
[04:41:30.200 --> 04:41:31.620]  Second place is
[04:41:31.620 --> 04:41:32.620]  Geoff's Monty Mole.
[04:41:32.620 --> 04:41:34.060]  Four stars.
[04:41:35.140 --> 04:41:36.800]  147 coins. Third place
[04:41:36.800 --> 04:41:38.100]  Nick's Mario.
[04:41:38.540 --> 04:41:40.200]  Four stars, 141 coins.
[04:41:40.640 --> 04:41:42.980]  And in last place, sorry billionaires,
[04:41:43.440 --> 04:41:44.400]  bringing up the rear,
[04:41:45.280 --> 04:41:46.240]  Nick's Dilkong.
[04:41:46.360 --> 04:41:47.740]  I'm sorry, Andrew's Dilkong.
[04:41:48.460 --> 04:41:49.900]  Don't put that evil on him.
[04:41:51.620 --> 04:41:52.820]  131 coins.
[04:41:52.880 --> 04:41:54.380]  You finished last in everything there, bud.
[04:41:55.000 --> 04:41:56.000]  Not last in...
[04:41:56.000 --> 04:41:58.020]  In those stats, I mean, I had
[04:41:58.380 --> 04:42:00.460]  the most shop items bought.
[04:42:00.460 --> 04:42:02.420]  I had the most bowsers.
[04:42:02.520 --> 04:42:04.960]  You weren't last in our hearts.
[04:42:05.300 --> 04:42:05.960]  Oh, that's true.
[04:42:06.540 --> 04:42:08.000]  Who was last in your hearts?
[04:42:08.580 --> 04:42:08.820]  Gavin.
[04:42:10.580 --> 04:42:11.880]  It's always Gavin.
[04:42:12.160 --> 04:42:13.660]  I'm super not used to winning.
[04:42:14.360 --> 04:42:16.180]  No, and you fucking
[04:42:16.180 --> 04:42:18.520]  crushed this 30 turn
[04:42:18.520 --> 04:42:20.120]  Mario Party. You really did great.
[04:42:20.200 --> 04:42:22.160]  Way to go, man. Congratulations.
[04:42:22.360 --> 04:42:24.420]  You did, but you only have first in five
[04:42:24.420 --> 04:42:25.800]  of the categories, which is also...
[04:42:25.800 --> 04:42:27.120]  It's a fascinating win.
[04:42:27.120 --> 04:42:28.840]  Look, halfway through the game,
[04:42:28.980 --> 04:42:31.120]  my goal wasn't to win the game. It was to kill Dilkong.
[04:42:32.740 --> 04:42:33.540]  Mission succeeded.
[04:42:33.860 --> 04:42:34.800]  You did great on both.
[04:42:34.900 --> 04:42:36.340]  You won, and you murdered me.
[04:42:36.860 --> 04:42:38.720]  It doesn't matter how you raise the trophy.
[04:42:38.840 --> 04:42:41.060]  At the end of the day, it just matters if you raise the trophy
[04:42:41.060 --> 04:42:41.940]  and Gavin do it.
[04:42:42.280 --> 04:42:44.460]  Thank you so much, Gavin.
[04:42:44.940 --> 04:42:47.020]  He is the first champion. He doesn't win
[04:42:47.020 --> 04:42:48.660]  anything because we didn't offer
[04:42:48.660 --> 04:42:50.520]  a prize for a victim.
[04:42:51.080 --> 04:42:52.800]  No red loses anything either
[04:42:52.800 --> 04:42:55.100]  because there were no punishments, so we'll have to work on that
[04:42:55.100 --> 04:42:57.120]  the next time. I would like to say, if you're watching this
[04:42:57.120 --> 04:42:59.060]  on YouTube, we release this
[04:42:59.060 --> 04:43:01.060]  daily as we film the daily
[04:43:01.060 --> 04:43:03.120]  over on Patreon. If you enjoyed this,
[04:43:03.160 --> 04:43:05.460]  we would love it if you would go over to the Patreon.
[04:43:06.060 --> 04:43:07.100]  Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod
[04:43:07.840 --> 04:43:09.100]  and check it out because
[04:43:09.100 --> 04:43:11.260]  we do put content like this up there all the time.
[04:43:11.480 --> 04:43:13.100]  This whole point, the whole point of this was
[04:43:13.100 --> 04:43:15.280]  to get you guys over there, so it'd be cool if you did it.
[04:43:15.380 --> 04:43:17.000]  And then if you're on Patreon and you were just
[04:43:17.000 --> 04:43:18.940]  watching this for free for the last 30 days, maybe
[04:43:18.940 --> 04:43:21.180]  consider throwing a subscription
[04:43:21.180 --> 04:43:22.940]  our way and seeing what the
[04:43:22.940 --> 04:43:24.840]  the other, the drafts and the other things
[04:43:24.840 --> 04:43:26.780]  that we do, the Falcon events are
[04:43:26.780 --> 04:43:28.880]  because if you enjoyed this, I think you might
[04:43:28.880 --> 04:43:31.020]  like that. And if you enjoyed this,
[04:43:31.320 --> 04:43:32.900]  tune in next month when we start
[04:43:33.880 --> 04:43:35.000]  365 days of
[04:43:35.000 --> 04:43:36.740]  Mario Party. Shut up. No.
[04:43:37.040 --> 04:43:38.380]  Shut up. No.
[04:43:38.840 --> 04:43:40.440]  If you did watch, it's gonna be
[04:43:40.440 --> 04:43:42.840]  18 30 part turns
[04:43:42.840 --> 04:43:44.460]  and then one 5 round turn.
[04:43:44.840 --> 04:43:45.920]  Oh my God.
[04:43:47.220 --> 04:43:48.460]  What were you saying about every morning, Gavin?
[04:43:49.540 --> 04:43:51.120]  I just wanna, I wanna thank you very much
[04:43:51.120 --> 04:43:52.640]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[04:43:53.020 --> 04:43:54.740]  It became routine for a lot of the audience
[04:43:54.740 --> 04:43:57.100]  and I loved it. I had a lot of fun doing it.
[04:43:57.560 --> 04:43:58.420]  So much fun. Absolutely.
[04:43:58.860 --> 04:44:01.060]  It was nice to spend 30 days without
[04:44:01.060 --> 04:44:02.460]  a shirt with all of you.
[04:44:03.880 --> 04:44:05.280]  Yeah, enjoying my coffee,
[04:44:05.420 --> 04:44:07.400]  nipples out, playing a little bit of Mario Party.
[04:44:07.680 --> 04:44:08.280]  Time of my life.
[04:44:08.680 --> 04:44:10.760]  Before we wrap, special thanks to
[04:44:10.760 --> 04:44:13.060]  Jake, Sean, and Larry, the editing team that helped put this
[04:44:13.060 --> 04:44:14.920]  together. They did amazing. It was awesome.
[04:44:15.780 --> 04:44:16.720]  Absolutely. Thank you.
[04:44:17.300 --> 04:44:19.000]  Links to their socials and everything
[04:44:19.000 --> 04:44:20.900]  and a shout out in the description
[04:44:20.900 --> 04:44:23.120]  of the big YouTube video. So check them out and say
[04:44:23.120 --> 04:44:25.200]  thanks because they did a really great
[04:44:25.200 --> 04:44:27.080]  job in the
[04:44:27.080 --> 04:44:28.920]  last couple days especially where
[04:44:28.920 --> 04:44:30.940]  we had to pivot and do
[04:44:30.940 --> 04:44:32.820]  different times and make stuff happen
[04:44:32.820 --> 04:44:35.100]  outside of our regular sort of order.
[04:44:35.880 --> 04:44:36.960]  No problems, no
[04:44:36.960 --> 04:44:38.560]  issues. They got these videos out to you.
[04:44:38.900 --> 04:44:40.860]  This has been really fun. When we started this,
[04:44:40.920 --> 04:44:42.880]  I really did not know if we were capable of it.
[04:44:44.500 --> 04:44:45.260]  I'm stunned.
[04:44:45.360 --> 04:44:47.240]  I sit here stunned that we did it all the way.
[04:44:47.240 --> 04:44:48.120]  It's a way to go, guys.
[04:44:48.540 --> 04:44:51.040]  We did it the exact same way 28 times
[04:44:51.040 --> 04:44:52.740]  and then slightly differently two times.
[04:44:53.980 --> 04:44:55.340]  But we still got it
[04:44:55.340 --> 04:44:57.060]  done. And speaking of thanking our
[04:44:57.060 --> 04:44:59.120]  wonderful editors because that was really a tremendous
[04:44:59.120 --> 04:45:01.180]  amount of lift to get this done
[04:45:01.180 --> 04:45:03.320]  in such a quick turnaround. Also, a special
[04:45:03.320 --> 04:45:05.260]  thanks to Andrew, who is the
[04:45:05.260 --> 04:45:06.900]  one who works with them and coordinates
[04:45:06.900 --> 04:45:09.400]  and makes sure that all the trains run on time.
[04:45:10.000 --> 04:45:11.240]  And I don't think we ever give you
[04:45:11.240 --> 04:45:13.300]  any credit for that, Andrew, but I really do appreciate the work you do
[04:45:13.300 --> 04:45:14.380]  behind the scenes. We all do.
[04:45:14.960 --> 04:45:16.000]  As a reward, Andrew,
[04:45:16.400 --> 04:45:17.540]  get some sleep.
[04:45:18.220 --> 04:45:19.820]  Oh yeah, I'm gonna dream
[04:45:20.560 --> 04:45:22.220]  being in third tomorrow.
[04:45:22.460 --> 04:45:23.160]  It's gonna be great.
[04:45:24.240 --> 04:45:25.580]  Living my best life.
[04:45:26.180 --> 04:45:27.740]  Gavin, you gonna get checks in the mail today?
[04:45:28.660 --> 04:45:29.720]  Yeah, when do you pay us?
[04:45:30.340 --> 04:45:32.260]  Yeah, I need my grant. I'm about to go out of town.
[04:45:32.520 --> 04:45:34.340]  Well, you said we didn't decide on
[04:45:34.340 --> 04:45:35.920]  any winning or losing.
[04:45:36.560 --> 04:45:38.460]  Well, that's true. He's got us there.
[04:45:38.800 --> 04:45:39.840]  But until next time.
[04:45:40.380 --> 04:45:41.580]  I mean, Geoff said that. I didn't say that.
[04:45:41.580 --> 04:45:43.260]  Which is apparently next month, but it's not.
[04:45:43.340 --> 04:45:44.600]  Don't listen to Geoff. That's a lie.
[04:45:45.720 --> 04:45:46.960]  365 days of Mario.
[04:45:47.500 --> 04:45:49.520]  If I give everyone ten bucks, can I get a
[04:45:49.520 --> 04:45:51.060]  great card? No.
[04:45:51.400 --> 04:45:53.860]  No. Stop trying to get great cards.
[04:45:54.520 --> 04:45:55.340]  We gotta wrap this up.
[04:45:55.940 --> 04:45:56.560]  We'll talk to you soon.
[04:45:56.740 --> 04:45:59.160]  Appreciate you. Thank you so much.
[04:45:59.400 --> 04:46:00.900]  Check out the podcast. Bye!
[04:46:01.360 --> 04:46:01.680]  Bye!
