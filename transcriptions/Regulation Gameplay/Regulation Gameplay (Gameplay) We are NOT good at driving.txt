[00:00.000 --> 00:01.260]  Alright, Spaceman, lead the way.
[00:01.660 --> 00:02.200]  Let's do it!
[00:02.380 --> 00:03.840]  You know, be careful, they will shoot you, Gavin.
[00:04.260 --> 00:05.360]  Seeing that- oh, that was a good spin.
[00:05.720 --> 00:07.780]  Nope, nope, nope, you're making the same mistake I made.
[00:07.800 --> 00:09.200]  It's okay, I did it the first time too.
[00:10.140 --> 00:11.100]  We've all got to do that.
[00:11.700 --> 00:13.280]  It's okay, that doesn't matter.
[00:13.640 --> 00:15.000]  Now is your time to shine!
[00:16.220 --> 00:17.000]  Nice. Nice!
[00:18.740 --> 00:20.080]  Got the bonus points for the guy.
[00:21.240 --> 00:23.000]  Duckin' and weavin', duckin' and weavin'.
[00:23.000 --> 00:23.180]  Oh!
[00:23.680 --> 00:24.620]  Spinnin' and weavin'.
[00:24.620 --> 00:25.960]  Good weave, good duck.
[00:27.080 --> 00:28.380]  I mean, we- we ducked.
[00:28.380 --> 00:29.780]  Alright, that guy is dead as dicks.
[00:29.780 --> 00:30.580]  We're trapped.
[00:31.080 --> 00:31.640]  Gavin?
[00:32.000 --> 00:32.380]  Hey, guys.
[00:32.560 --> 00:32.920]  I just-
[00:32.920 --> 00:33.680]  Ga- Gavin?
[00:33.920 --> 00:35.400]  I'M GETTING THROWN OUT OF THE CAR!
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.480]  I'M GETTING THROWN OUT OF THE VEHICLE!
[00:38.020 --> 00:38.340]  GA-
[00:38.340 --> 00:38.840]  NO!
[00:39.120 --> 00:39.440]  NO!
[00:40.400 --> 00:41.220]  I'M GETTING-
[00:41.220 --> 00:41.840]  NO!
[00:42.200 --> 00:42.680]  NO!
[00:44.800 --> 00:45.920]  JESUS CHRIST!
[00:46.740 --> 00:48.000]  How can-
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.080]  Legitimately the funniest thing I've ever-
[00:49.080 --> 00:52.880]  One of the guys came up and threw me out and started beating me up.
[00:55.380 --> 00:55.940]  GAVIN!
[00:56.900 --> 00:57.180]  GAVIN!
[00:57.180 --> 00:57.240]  GAVIN!
