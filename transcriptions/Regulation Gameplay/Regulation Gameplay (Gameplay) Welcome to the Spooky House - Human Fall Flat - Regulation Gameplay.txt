[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  Here we go. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[00:06.180 --> 00:08.640]  Awful count. I don't know what you did there. That was terrible.
[00:09.260 --> 00:11.120]  I thought it was fine.
[00:11.420 --> 00:14.540]  Yeah, I don't think anybody's agreeing with you, bud. I think you might be on an island on your...
[00:14.540 --> 00:17.200]  The one was a little off, but that was good.
[00:17.340 --> 00:18.720]  I'm not judging at all. I would never criticize.
[00:18.720 --> 00:23.180]  I mean, I think it was just fine. No one else jumped on me. I think that you're wrong.
[00:23.340 --> 00:26.380]  And welcome to the spooky house, guys. It's you and 4Flat.
[00:26.620 --> 00:27.340]  Oh, we're in a spooky house?
[00:27.340 --> 00:32.860]  Yeah, we got two dogs, and we're at a level called Dark, so prepare yourself.
[00:33.280 --> 00:34.220]  Ooh, a bit of dunkle.
[00:35.460 --> 00:37.220]  Oh, that's fun. I like that.
[00:37.420 --> 00:40.380]  Ugh, box time.
[00:41.120 --> 00:42.440]  Okay, let's see if I can just push this.
[00:42.720 --> 00:45.640]  No! You okay? Okay.
[00:47.220 --> 00:49.420]  Oh, you're trying to climb? Oh, we gotta get up here. Yeah, we gotta get up here.
[00:49.420 --> 00:50.980]  I think we can break this door, maybe.
[00:51.720 --> 00:53.780]  You think so? Alright, you work on that while we climb.
[00:55.040 --> 00:58.080]  Oh, he's done it as well. You were doing it.
[00:59.160 --> 01:00.380]  Yeah, yeah, you just gotta break it. Here.
[01:02.060 --> 01:02.620]  There you go.
[01:05.040 --> 01:06.400]  Someone wants to climb over me.
[01:06.760 --> 01:08.740]  Oh, push. Oh, you know what? Nope.
[01:09.840 --> 01:12.820]  Guys, I think you're going the wrong way with this.
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.040]  Dog on the case. Dog on the case.
[01:15.520 --> 01:16.740]  Dog on the case?
[01:16.860 --> 01:17.960]  Hey, sniff it out like a bone.
[01:18.480 --> 01:19.360]  Alright, guys, dog on the case.
[01:19.600 --> 01:20.900]  Oh, dog on the case.
[01:20.900 --> 01:25.720]  Alright, Andrew's the- just so you don't get confused, Andrew's the white dog and Geoff is the brown dog.
[01:25.900 --> 01:28.220]  Did you make it to the outside? Dog on the case.
[01:28.500 --> 01:30.420]  I got a nose for this thing.
[01:30.580 --> 01:32.280]  Oh, that's fun.
[01:36.680 --> 01:38.520]  Did- Andrew, did you have McGruff?
[01:39.520 --> 01:41.160]  Uh, no, I did not. Okay.
[01:42.400 --> 01:44.220]  I'm distinctly not a crime dog.
[01:44.820 --> 01:46.620]  McGruff the crime dog, US thing, right?
[01:47.100 --> 01:49.000]  Was he just called McGruff or Scruff McGruff?
[01:49.540 --> 01:50.820]  He was just called McGruff.
[01:51.500 --> 01:51.940]  Scruff?
[01:52.140 --> 01:53.680]  Was he called Scruff McGruff?
[01:53.780 --> 01:58.140]  No, Scruff- no, Scruff- Scruff McGruff is like his, like, nephew or something.
[01:58.460 --> 01:58.720]  Oh, okay.
[01:59.360 --> 02:01.300]  Oh, like- like Scrappy-Doo?
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.800]  Yeah, he's like Scrappy-Doo.
[02:03.020 --> 02:05.820]  I only know Scruff McGruff because of The Ultimate Showdown.
[02:06.540 --> 02:07.220]  Oh, cool.
[02:07.620 --> 02:09.540]  The Ultimate Showdown.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.560]  It said he took a bite out of crime.
[02:11.860 --> 02:12.160]  AHH!
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.920]  So, wait, so you have a nose for this, but you're back in here with us?
[02:15.980 --> 02:19.580]  I fell. I- I've got a nose for this, but a leg for something else.
[02:19.580 --> 02:21.180]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[02:21.300 --> 02:23.420]  Oh, he's back- Eric, he's back in the pound.
[02:24.040 --> 02:24.620]  What's happening?
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.960]  I fell. I tripped.
[02:26.440 --> 02:28.300]  Why is up there? What is that?
[02:28.380 --> 02:30.760]  It looks like we need to get that, uh...
[02:30.760 --> 02:32.720]  I need help. I can't do this by myself.
[02:33.060 --> 02:33.840]  Can't do what?
[02:34.140 --> 02:38.900]  There's a thing I gotta lift to open the door for you guys, but it's too much for one person.
[02:39.260 --> 02:40.040]  I'll do it.
[02:41.060 --> 02:42.760]  Oh, why did you do that?
[02:42.980 --> 02:44.240]  What do you mean? I'm helping you.
[02:44.260 --> 02:46.500]  I'm helping the crime dog.
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.700]  I thought you wanted that. Don't you want that?
[02:49.300 --> 02:50.580]  You've almost got it.
[02:51.760 --> 02:53.040]  To me. To you.
[02:53.880 --> 02:55.900]  It's coming. We got it. We're free.
[02:56.420 --> 02:57.120]  Nice job.
[02:57.680 --> 02:58.820]  Let's lock him back up.
[02:59.100 --> 03:00.960]  Yeah, lock him up.
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.540]  Alright, lock him in.
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.480]  Lock him up.
[03:05.500 --> 03:06.240]  I'll teach him.
[03:06.720 --> 03:07.640]  Who are we locking?
[03:08.900 --> 03:10.400]  Oh, he's already locked.
[03:14.140 --> 03:16.860]  Can we chop down this tree?
[03:16.860 --> 03:17.960]  Mildly embarrassing.
[03:19.760 --> 03:21.060]  Nick, did that work?
[03:21.440 --> 03:21.640]  Nope.
[03:24.480 --> 03:25.780]  Is there a...
[03:25.780 --> 03:27.440]  There was an axe in the other room, though.
[03:27.920 --> 03:28.460]  There is?
[03:28.820 --> 03:30.420]  Yeah, it was like the thing that was in there.
[03:31.320 --> 03:32.900]  The thing that was in there?
[03:33.320 --> 03:35.560]  Did you not understand that, Geoff?
[03:36.400 --> 03:38.060]  Well, I said, do we need that thing?
[03:38.160 --> 03:39.840]  And the thing, I think, would be the axe.
[03:42.080 --> 03:45.100]  I don't remember Gavin saying that at all.
[03:45.840 --> 03:48.660]  This is some fucking revisionist history.
[03:48.820 --> 03:49.180]  Yeah.
[03:49.340 --> 03:52.540]  I heard a thing about a thing, but I didn't hear a thing about an axe.
[03:52.740 --> 03:54.520]  Look in the room, and there's like a thing up there.
[03:55.060 --> 03:55.600]  Let's take this.
[03:56.020 --> 03:56.380]  Where?
[03:57.240 --> 04:01.820]  This is like the other day, Gavin tried to tell me the British didn't really want to keep America in the first place.
[04:01.940 --> 04:02.700]  Oh, is that right?
[04:03.260 --> 04:03.920]  Is that right?
[04:04.760 --> 04:06.300]  That's what they tell them over there.
[04:07.700 --> 04:08.580]  That's what they say.
[04:08.740 --> 04:09.960]  It's a big part of history lessons.
[04:10.720 --> 04:12.800]  Yeah, we didn't even want America.
[04:12.960 --> 04:14.820]  It's resources were actually so lame.
[04:20.680 --> 04:22.300]  Help me, Dogman axe.
[04:25.200 --> 04:25.800]  There you go.
[04:27.220 --> 04:28.460]  Alright, hop up, boys.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.880]  Look, Andrew's already up there.
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.320]  I got a nose for it!
[04:34.920 --> 04:35.400]  Oh, look at that!
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.080]  Oh, that's that axe Gavin never talked about.
[04:38.080 --> 04:39.320]  Oh, is that that thing?
[04:40.180 --> 04:42.040]  I'm gonna George Washington this fucking thing.
[04:42.100 --> 04:42.420]  Let's go!
[04:43.020 --> 04:44.220]  Cherry tree, baby!
[04:44.960 --> 04:45.440]  Did you do it?
[04:46.480 --> 04:47.320]  Did it work?
[04:49.740 --> 04:50.500]  Get it down!
[04:50.840 --> 04:51.980]  It's doggy!
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.000]  You're doing great.
[04:54.420 --> 04:55.080]  It's coming!
[04:57.180 --> 04:59.100]  And now you guys are next!
[04:59.100 --> 05:00.000]  Grab it, grab it, grab it!
[05:02.900 --> 05:04.100]  Where are you guys?
[05:04.760 --> 05:05.400]  What do you mean?
[05:05.400 --> 05:06.420]  What do you mean?
[05:06.640 --> 05:07.420]  Where are you, Nick?
[05:09.520 --> 05:10.240]  Where's Nick?
[05:10.640 --> 05:12.040]  Oh, there you are!
[05:12.300 --> 05:13.220]  I circled the building.
[05:14.100 --> 05:15.460]  Okay, we got a bridge now.
[05:18.080 --> 05:19.420]  Grab it, grab it, grab it!
[05:19.580 --> 05:20.000]  Oh, boy.
[05:20.100 --> 05:21.120]  What if I told you?
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.580]  I'm hurting instead of helping.
[05:24.660 --> 05:25.800]  Push it all the way over.
[05:26.160 --> 05:27.440]  I'll be the weight.
[05:28.460 --> 05:30.120]  Why would we want a weight?
[05:30.460 --> 05:32.060]  Because I fall in and I can't get up.
[05:33.200 --> 05:34.040]  Counterbalance, Eric.
[05:34.180 --> 05:34.640]  Counterbalance.
[05:36.380 --> 05:37.920]  Geoff is holding me.
[05:38.120 --> 05:39.180]  I got it!
[05:39.280 --> 05:39.980]  I got it!
[05:41.560 --> 05:42.840]  Help us!
[05:52.960 --> 05:55.960]  Why would we want a weight?
[05:56.240 --> 05:57.200]  I still don't understand.
[05:58.200 --> 05:58.640]  Counterbalance.
[05:58.640 --> 06:01.000]  It landed in the right place.
[06:01.240 --> 06:01.860]  There you go.
[06:01.920 --> 06:02.940]  Just push it forward.
[06:03.740 --> 06:05.840]  So, really, just had to cut it funny.
[06:06.740 --> 06:09.200]  What? No, that is not me, Mr. Weight Man.
[06:09.740 --> 06:11.660]  If anything, it was Andrew's fault, I think.
[06:11.940 --> 06:13.300]  Guys, not that guy!
[06:13.920 --> 06:15.000]  Oh, is that my fault?
[06:15.760 --> 06:17.080]  Whoopsie, whoopsie-doopsie.
[06:17.300 --> 06:18.300]  Did I do that?
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.280]  You motherfucker!
[06:25.140 --> 06:27.300]  Whoopsie-doopsie, did I do that?
[06:27.860 --> 06:29.580]  I shoved that fucking log
[06:29.580 --> 06:30.560]  right off the side.
[06:30.660 --> 06:33.540]  Why won't my guy get up?
[06:33.720 --> 06:34.280]  There we go.
[06:34.860 --> 06:36.200]  Alright, is that over?
[06:36.620 --> 06:38.020]  Yeah, I think that's good.
[06:38.100 --> 06:38.880]  That's it, that's perfect.
[06:39.980 --> 06:41.500]  A bunch of people just died.
[06:43.780 --> 06:45.380]  Alright, try not to wangle it too much
[06:45.380 --> 06:45.980]  because it's going to go.
[06:46.280 --> 06:47.280]  Oh, I love a good wangle.
[06:48.020 --> 06:49.000]  Are you the white dog, Andrew?
[06:49.720 --> 06:50.440]  Always wangling.
[06:52.180 --> 06:53.800]  It's because I made it, baby.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.520]  I'm not answering you, Nick, that's what he said.
[06:55.740 --> 06:56.540]  He sure did.
[06:56.620 --> 06:58.540]  Are you the white dog?
[06:58.960 --> 07:01.180]  I thought you were saying something about wangling.
[07:01.380 --> 07:02.800]  Hey, thanks for killing me, white dog.
[07:04.400 --> 07:06.300]  Do you think dogs know what color they are?
[07:06.940 --> 07:07.880]  No, they're colorblind.
[07:08.240 --> 07:08.420]  Right?
[07:10.120 --> 07:12.140]  They don't if they're fluffy, I think.
[07:12.680 --> 07:13.340]  Yeah, they're hot.
[07:15.640 --> 07:16.440]  Geoff, Geoff.
[07:17.160 --> 07:18.020]  I'll get this.
[07:18.420 --> 07:20.140]  I'm trying to pull it back up for you.
[07:20.240 --> 07:20.600]  No!
[07:21.140 --> 07:22.120]  I'm holding you.
[07:22.120 --> 07:23.640]  I'm holding you.
[07:23.700 --> 07:24.300]  Swing me over.
[07:27.380 --> 07:29.020]  White dog, don't let go.
[07:29.660 --> 07:30.400]  I'm holding.
[07:30.800 --> 07:32.120]  Are you guys still back there?
[07:32.120 --> 07:33.340]  Somebody come over there.
[07:34.400 --> 07:35.600]  I'm losing him.
[07:35.860 --> 07:37.420]  I'm losing him.
[07:38.320 --> 07:39.820]  I'm losing him.
[07:41.300 --> 07:43.000]  I'm moving my body.
[07:44.060 --> 07:45.660]  Here, I'm going to let go for a second,
[07:45.760 --> 07:46.500]  then I'm going to re-grab it.
[07:46.500 --> 07:48.280]  Don't you do it, you son of a bitch.
[07:48.280 --> 07:49.480]  Don't you let go.
[07:49.960 --> 07:51.400]  Grab, grab, grab.
[07:53.600 --> 07:55.860]  And then he's going to fall over here.
[07:56.260 --> 07:58.060]  Yeah, and you made it across.
[07:59.160 --> 08:00.240]  Alright, that was close.
[08:01.560 --> 08:02.400]  Sounds like it.
[08:02.540 --> 08:03.040]  Good job, everybody.
[08:04.400 --> 08:06.280]  Alright, do we need to cook up this bad boy?
[08:07.320 --> 08:08.000]  I think so.
[08:08.940 --> 08:09.780]  How do we get this hot?
[08:10.720 --> 08:12.160]  I think we have to pull
[08:12.160 --> 08:13.740]  this back all the way.
[08:14.540 --> 08:15.800]  Get these rocks out of the way.
[08:16.280 --> 08:18.080]  There's like a furnace in the middle.
[08:18.160 --> 08:19.560]  Dude, we're going to smelt a key.
[08:20.040 --> 08:21.660]  Yeah, I think that's exactly what it is.
[08:22.660 --> 08:23.900]  You know how people
[08:23.900 --> 08:25.700]  can be crushed into stuff
[08:25.700 --> 08:26.680]  after they die?
[08:27.400 --> 08:29.940]  I think a key would be awesome if you became a house key.
[08:30.300 --> 08:31.100]  Why is it slow?
[08:32.440 --> 08:33.340]  There we go. Thank you, Nick.
[08:33.600 --> 08:34.360]  Ash key?
[08:35.580 --> 08:37.960]  Yeah, but you'd be able to compress hard carbon.
[08:38.280 --> 08:39.500]  We have to get all of these
[08:40.020 --> 08:42.120]  pieces out, and then we
[08:42.120 --> 08:43.900]  take them over to the smelter.
[08:43.900 --> 08:45.060]  Oh, okay.
[08:45.120 --> 08:46.720]  Wasn't that a TV show, Hard Carbon?
[08:47.380 --> 08:47.760]  Oh, great.
[08:49.660 --> 08:50.840]  Like a Netflix show?
[08:52.300 --> 08:53.660]  Altered Carbon, that's what it was.
[08:54.380 --> 08:54.780]  Oh, yeah.
[08:55.580 --> 08:57.780]  It was like the most expensive show ever.
[08:59.380 --> 09:01.400]  We could probably just toss it over this, right?
[09:01.620 --> 09:02.440]  Yeah, I think that's the way.
[09:02.480 --> 09:03.760]  Do you guys need anything up here?
[09:06.980 --> 09:07.780]  We're coming
[09:07.780 --> 09:08.920]  with this coal.
[09:10.720 --> 09:11.860]  So I think this is what we
[09:11.860 --> 09:14.000]  need to make Gavin into a key or whatever.
[09:14.420 --> 09:15.120]  So there's a smelt?
[09:16.300 --> 09:17.840]  Yeah, it's in the
[09:19.440 --> 09:19.820]  middle.
[09:20.140 --> 09:21.880]  Oh, I think I
[09:21.880 --> 09:23.180]  see what I gotta do.
[09:23.680 --> 09:25.600]  Andrew, I'd be a car key.
[09:25.840 --> 09:26.800]  And then we'll just light it, right?
[09:27.860 --> 09:28.480]  You wanna grab it, Geoff?
[09:28.900 --> 09:31.460]  That way, at least most of the time, I'd be electric.
[09:32.240 --> 09:33.640]  I'm not near you guys, I don't think.
[09:33.940 --> 09:34.220]  Oh, okay.
[09:35.260 --> 09:37.320]  Go, Eric, go!
[09:37.780 --> 09:39.640]  Why are we melting, though? We've got no melt.
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.380]  I don't know.
[09:41.240 --> 09:43.560]  I've got a bunch of rocks or something up here
[09:43.560 --> 09:44.560]  that I'm putting into
[09:45.300 --> 09:47.720]  some sort of a platform that when it gets heavy
[09:47.720 --> 09:48.960]  enough, I think it'll lower it to you.
[09:49.120 --> 09:50.560]  Does it look like it could be a key?
[09:51.100 --> 09:52.640]  It does look like it could be a key.
[09:53.780 --> 09:55.400]  Why are you at the top?
[09:55.620 --> 09:56.080]  What are you doing?
[09:56.480 --> 09:58.960]  I thought it would look cool. You drop it like the
[09:58.960 --> 10:01.320]  key into Mount Doom. What's the thing that goes into Mount Doom?
[10:01.480 --> 10:01.880]  A ring.
[10:03.420 --> 10:03.960]  Yeah, the one key.
[10:04.780 --> 10:06.240]  It makes doors invisible.
[10:06.240 --> 10:08.560]  Well, that's why
[10:08.560 --> 10:09.620]  he kept it around his neck.
[10:09.740 --> 10:14.580]  I just thought it would look cool.
[10:15.120 --> 10:15.500]  It didn't.
[10:15.620 --> 10:17.560]  It's like cinema, you know?
[10:17.800 --> 10:20.420]  Oh, wait, how is
[10:20.420 --> 10:22.340]  someone on the other side of where we're making
[10:22.340 --> 10:22.940]  the key for?
[10:24.260 --> 10:26.060]  I got around, you just go through the tunnel
[10:26.060 --> 10:26.780]  and there's a door.
[10:27.640 --> 10:29.300]  What are we doing with this key, then?
[10:29.340 --> 10:30.640]  I don't know what you're doing with that key.
[10:31.160 --> 10:33.940]  So if we die, do we spawn where he is?
[10:33.940 --> 10:34.580]  Probably.
[10:35.180 --> 10:35.940]  Let me go find out.
[10:36.840 --> 10:38.120]  I wanted to see the key.
[10:39.560 --> 10:40.520]  Let's make the key.
[10:41.680 --> 10:43.200]  You clearly don't care about the key.
[10:43.320 --> 10:43.600]  It's fine.
[10:43.880 --> 10:47.900]  You abandon your key.
[10:48.180 --> 10:49.420]  While you get the metal,
[10:49.520 --> 10:51.200]  I'm going to quickly see if I can become a key.
[10:51.960 --> 10:52.160]  Okay.
[10:53.560 --> 10:54.520]  Hey, Gavin, there's a...
[10:55.540 --> 10:56.480]  I don't think
[10:57.280 --> 10:58.360]  you're becoming a key.
[10:59.000 --> 10:59.720]  You look cool, though.
[11:03.260 --> 11:04.700]  I'll have a seat and watch you.
[11:07.940 --> 11:09.560]  There's a cage up here.
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.460]  Yeah, I was
[11:11.460 --> 11:12.580]  fucking around the cage earlier.
[11:13.720 --> 11:15.240]  If you go past the cage,
[11:16.140 --> 11:17.800]  you can use the cage to jump on it,
[11:17.880 --> 11:19.100]  Nick, you can spin around
[11:19.100 --> 11:20.580]  to the other side of the map.
[11:20.620 --> 11:21.700]  Oh, that's great.
[11:23.120 --> 11:25.440]  And then you get up there, there's a platform
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.880]  you can dump rocks on.
[11:26.880 --> 11:28.820]  I was dumping rocks on it to lower it.
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.620]  Oh, no, Gavin!
[11:30.760 --> 11:31.260]  Gavin, give me all the way!
[11:32.100 --> 11:32.720]  Gavin, let go!
[11:35.180 --> 11:36.140]  Oh, you made it.
[11:36.400 --> 11:37.260]  Well done, fellas.
[11:37.740 --> 11:40.620]  I can't believe that.
[11:42.760 --> 11:44.520]  That's something I probably couldn't do in real life.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.100]  No. You could try.
[11:46.400 --> 11:47.020]  I could try.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.860]  Can we make you a helmet with a handle on?
[11:50.720 --> 11:51.440]  Yeah, sure.
[11:52.020 --> 11:52.900]  Hey, what do you think is down there?
[11:52.900 --> 11:53.920]  Ooh.
[11:54.420 --> 11:55.200]  Is it metal?
[11:57.140 --> 11:57.660]  Huh.
[11:59.080 --> 12:01.040]  So Geoff already opened this door
[12:01.040 --> 12:01.660]  hatch thing.
[12:02.080 --> 12:03.280]  He did.
[12:03.840 --> 12:05.480]  But there's nothing to smelt.
[12:06.340 --> 12:08.720]  Is this like a...
[12:08.720 --> 12:10.220]  What's this big horn about?
[12:10.980 --> 12:12.900]  The horn's connected to the...
[12:14.080 --> 12:15.060]  Hey, where are you guys at?
[12:15.640 --> 12:16.660]  Up at the top.
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.620]  Okay, hey, check it out. If you look over here...
[12:18.620 --> 12:20.860]  Oh, that's what did it. That's what opened
[12:20.860 --> 12:22.140]  the hole. Okay, I see.
[12:23.180 --> 12:24.180]  Hey, it's a brown dog.
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.340]  You look like a little monster.
[12:26.800 --> 12:28.160]  So did you guys go down the hole yet?
[12:29.380 --> 12:29.620]  No.
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.940]  That's what I just opened up.
[12:33.040 --> 12:34.540]  I wonder if it's...
[12:35.100 --> 12:36.860]  Oh, could I...
[12:38.560 --> 12:39.600]  I'm gonna bring this rock.
[12:40.180 --> 12:41.080]  Oh, that was foolish.
[12:42.160 --> 12:42.560]  Interesting.
[12:45.380 --> 12:46.460]  Where are we?
[12:47.340 --> 12:49.160]  Can someone come back here and help me?
[12:50.340 --> 12:51.300]  Andrew, I don't know
[12:51.300 --> 12:52.420]  where here is, man.
[12:52.960 --> 12:54.780]  Oh, you got the metal?
[12:55.480 --> 12:55.640]  Yeah.
[12:56.080 --> 12:56.560]  What?
[12:59.060 --> 13:01.200]  I like it when people sneak off and then
[13:01.200 --> 13:03.080]  act like we all knew that you snucked off.
[13:03.660 --> 13:04.780]  Or came back.
[13:05.000 --> 13:05.540]  Is this a giant anvil?
[13:06.600 --> 13:08.720]  I don't think this is...
[13:08.720 --> 13:09.760]  Is this right?
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.600]  When you're forging, you melt the anvil.
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.200]  No, I don't think so either.
[13:14.680 --> 13:15.280]  I mean metal.
[13:17.040 --> 13:17.340]  Okay.
[13:18.860 --> 13:19.640]  I'm a clock.
[13:19.840 --> 13:21.120]  And then what do we do? We put it at the top?
[13:21.240 --> 13:22.560]  Yeah, let's try to get it in here.
[13:23.500 --> 13:24.240]  I'm adding some heat.
[13:24.900 --> 13:25.380]  Why do we...
[13:27.780 --> 13:28.900]  What's it gonna do at the top?
[13:29.260 --> 13:30.360]  Does it melt in the top?
[13:30.920 --> 13:31.720]  I have no idea.
[13:32.340 --> 13:33.840]  I haven't done anything with the top yet.
[13:35.600 --> 13:36.200]  Bolted anvil?
[13:37.100 --> 13:38.960]  Geoff, are you below me? Are you in the clock tower?
[13:39.920 --> 13:40.520]  Clock tower?
[13:41.380 --> 13:41.980]  Melt me!
[13:42.540 --> 13:43.380]  Oh shit!
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.320]  I'm in the clock tower, Nick.
[13:47.140 --> 13:48.420]  Okay, I'm above you.
[13:48.500 --> 13:49.240]  That's pretty cool.
[13:49.500 --> 13:51.100]  Are you in the clock tower?
[13:51.340 --> 13:53.860]  I swung on the pendulum.
[13:54.560 --> 13:55.080]  How'd it go?
[13:55.540 --> 13:57.420]  I might be stuck, buddy.
[13:57.880 --> 13:58.780]  There's a clock face.
[13:59.620 --> 14:01.980]  Is there a reason for me to get up here?
[14:02.500 --> 14:03.700]  I'll tell you when I get to the top.
[14:03.700 --> 14:04.100]  Oh no.
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.320]  I just don't think this is the metal, Andrew.
[14:07.620 --> 14:08.280]  Fair enough.
[14:08.280 --> 14:10.680]  But I just don't know...
[14:10.680 --> 14:12.880]  I know, but I don't know that it fits in the top.
[14:15.740 --> 14:16.560]  What metal is anvil?
[14:18.660 --> 14:19.100]  Steel?
[14:20.440 --> 14:21.120]  I don't know.
[14:22.240 --> 14:24.120]  What do we do here?
[14:25.560 --> 14:27.060]  Should I jump on the...
[14:27.060 --> 14:28.260]  If you get up here,
[14:28.400 --> 14:30.520]  there's some gears.
[14:31.400 --> 14:32.660]  I don't think I can go any higher
[14:32.660 --> 14:34.220]  than I am from where I am.
[14:36.520 --> 14:36.960]  Unless...
[14:36.960 --> 14:37.380]  Yeah.
[14:37.700 --> 14:39.780]  Do I need to turn this to midnight or something?
[14:40.600 --> 14:42.120]  Yeah, take it from 6 to midnight.
[14:44.580 --> 14:45.020]  501!
[14:47.660 --> 14:48.780]  Tell it it's been good.
[14:51.220 --> 14:52.560]  Does all that shit...
[14:52.560 --> 14:53.660]  Does that melt?
[14:54.080 --> 14:54.820]  The one I'm throwing down?
[14:55.960 --> 14:57.040]  A rock key?
[14:58.180 --> 14:59.880]  We're so split up.
[15:00.020 --> 15:02.540]  This is such a weird...
[15:02.540 --> 15:03.700]  A rock does not melt.
[15:04.220 --> 15:04.440]  Okay.
[15:04.780 --> 15:06.640]  Does it float?
[15:08.180 --> 15:10.320]  Okay, so there is something back here.
[15:11.580 --> 15:12.380]  Yeah, there's a door
[15:12.380 --> 15:13.640]  in the tunnels over there.
[15:14.220 --> 15:15.640]  Yeah, that's where I found it.
[15:15.680 --> 15:16.700]  That's how I got on the other side.
[15:19.520 --> 15:20.220]  But, no, no, no.
[15:21.260 --> 15:21.700]  Like...
[15:21.700 --> 15:22.220]  Oh, really?
[15:22.580 --> 15:23.960]  Yeah, I broke a door.
[15:25.100 --> 15:25.540]  Weird.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.340]  Oh, I went too far.
[15:29.500 --> 15:30.140]  Damn it.
[15:30.420 --> 15:30.860]  Uh-oh.
[15:32.340 --> 15:33.500]  I might be, like, stuck.
[15:34.960 --> 15:35.980]  Are you in the tunnels?
[15:36.900 --> 15:37.040]  Yeah.
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.260]  Oh, God, I just came unstuck.
[15:42.340 --> 15:42.600]  Thank God.
[15:43.720 --> 15:46.360]  I'm just trying to move these rocks so I can jump up
[15:46.360 --> 15:47.340]  to where you're talking about.
[15:49.560 --> 15:50.680]  Nick, you're on your own up there.
[15:51.120 --> 15:51.420]  I can't get you.
[15:53.280 --> 15:54.800]  So this one clock face
[15:54.800 --> 15:56.560]  is just broken, and it doesn't seem to do anything.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.320]  Interesting.
[16:01.520 --> 16:02.360]  I assume...
[16:02.360 --> 16:02.960]  Oh!
[16:07.400 --> 16:08.760]  There's more stuff up there,
[16:08.780 --> 16:10.480]  but I cannot touch it.
[16:10.840 --> 16:11.700]  Did anybody make the key yet?
[16:12.560 --> 16:13.980]  I was trying with this anvil.
[16:15.420 --> 16:16.480]  Well, why don't you do it?
[16:16.640 --> 16:17.960]  I need more people to lift it.
[16:18.500 --> 16:18.980]  We're coming!
[16:20.380 --> 16:20.800]  Yahoo!
[16:22.200 --> 16:24.200]  I'm over in a fucking anvil, and nobody's around.
[16:24.200 --> 16:26.400]  I keep hearing about everybody's bitching about needing help with an anvil.
[16:26.560 --> 16:28.780]  Here I am. I'm the only person anvilling right now.
[16:28.820 --> 16:30.240]  I'm coming back!
[16:32.300 --> 16:33.000]  I'm here with you.
[16:33.140 --> 16:35.040]  Oh, hey, what's up, Nick? Thanks for coming to help me with the anvil.
[16:35.080 --> 16:36.720]  You know what? We were here the whole time.
[16:37.480 --> 16:38.180]  Somebody's gotta be here.
[16:38.680 --> 16:39.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[16:44.480 --> 16:44.920]  What's the...
[16:44.920 --> 16:48.660]  What's the gold in the furnace?
[16:49.980 --> 16:51.020]  Wait, it's in the furnace?
[16:52.120 --> 16:54.060]  Those are the, uh...
[16:54.060 --> 16:56.560]  Those are the, uh...
[16:56.560 --> 16:57.220]  Like, the coal.
[16:58.060 --> 16:59.720]  That was the coal to get it all started.
[17:00.900 --> 17:02.480]  It's the thing that makes it fire.
[17:02.840 --> 17:03.620]  They were black,
[17:03.860 --> 17:06.860]  and then they changed to, um...
[17:06.860 --> 17:07.280]  Oh, yeah.
[17:13.460 --> 17:15.380]  Did you guys get that anvil in yet, or what?
[17:15.680 --> 17:16.580]  Working on it.
[17:17.020 --> 17:20.220]  I feel like it's more than a two-man job, but whatever.
[17:21.280 --> 17:23.080]  Andrew was doing it by himself?
[17:23.360 --> 17:24.100]  Oh, no!
[17:24.660 --> 17:26.760]  It's okay, it's okay. Sacrifice me.
[17:27.640 --> 17:28.940]  I'll get you out, Nick.
[17:29.900 --> 17:30.260]  Uh-oh.
[17:32.240 --> 17:33.120]  Someone help me get Geoff.
[17:33.700 --> 17:34.120]  I'm trying.
[17:36.260 --> 17:37.680]  Andrew, what are you doing to me, man?
[17:38.180 --> 17:38.680]  I'm getting you.
[17:39.200 --> 17:41.060]  It feels like you're getting...
[17:41.060 --> 17:42.080]  I'm getting got, all right.
[17:43.240 --> 17:44.060]  Pull me out.
[17:44.660 --> 17:46.160]  Gavin, come over here. Grab my legs.
[17:46.660 --> 17:47.520]  Grab my legs and pull.
[17:47.520 --> 17:49.040]  Gavin, help us.
[17:49.140 --> 17:50.560]  We're trying to save Geoff.
[17:50.920 --> 17:52.620]  You can grab our butts.
[17:53.880 --> 17:54.540]  Get us.
[17:55.280 --> 17:56.980]  Nice. Okay, pull, pull, pull.
[17:57.060 --> 17:57.580]  Everybody pull.
[18:03.910 --> 18:04.950]  Oh, Geoff.
[18:05.050 --> 18:06.010]  I can't get up.
[18:06.950 --> 18:08.230]  He's almost free.
[18:08.350 --> 18:09.910]  We got him, we got him.
[18:10.090 --> 18:10.390]  Yay!
[18:12.030 --> 18:14.690]  Wouldn't it be down the mines?
[18:15.950 --> 18:17.490]  You would think, right?
[18:17.970 --> 18:19.130]  Yeah, a lot of people think stuff.
[18:20.470 --> 18:21.290]  Oh, I saw this
[18:21.290 --> 18:21.790]  white shit.
[18:23.270 --> 18:23.710]  Rocks.
[18:24.090 --> 18:26.890]  Can we rearrange the anvil
[18:26.890 --> 18:28.650]  so that it goes straight down the hole?
[18:29.170 --> 18:30.770]  I don't think you can melt an anvil.
[18:31.550 --> 18:32.390]  I don't think so either.
[18:33.570 --> 18:35.230]  All we gotta do is move
[18:35.230 --> 18:37.190]  these rocks out of the way so we can bring the
[18:37.190 --> 18:38.530]  cart down, right?
[18:40.010 --> 18:41.190]  Oh, can we fix the cart?
[18:41.370 --> 18:43.130]  That'd be awesome. Well, the cart was
[18:43.130 --> 18:44.750]  on the tracks until I showed up.
[18:45.010 --> 18:45.270]  Oh.
[18:45.270 --> 18:45.770]  Yeah.
[18:47.650 --> 18:49.170]  Let's see if I just
[18:49.170 --> 18:50.970]  pull this anvil. Ah, balls.
[18:51.150 --> 18:52.990]  I think the lever is blocking it.
[18:55.430 --> 18:57.270]  And then we can...
[18:58.910 --> 18:59.230]  Oh!
[19:01.930 --> 19:03.530]  These rocks out of the way for you.
[19:09.230 --> 19:10.290]  There we go.
[19:10.870 --> 19:13.370]  Are you guys clearing out the... you guys got the thing on the
[19:13.370 --> 19:15.330]  tracks? Well, we've had a bit of a derailment
[19:15.330 --> 19:17.370]  at some point. Geoff, lift
[19:17.370 --> 19:18.910]  your side. Okay.
[19:20.050 --> 19:21.370]  And then I'll...
[19:23.520 --> 19:24.680]  But lift it though. Yeah.
[19:25.200 --> 19:26.740]  Lift it. Get it
[19:26.740 --> 19:27.020]  lifted.
[19:31.960 --> 19:33.660]  Alright, good.
[19:34.400 --> 19:35.440]  This is my favorite game.
[19:36.340 --> 19:38.500]  Alright, it's on. Why, what'd you guys do?
[19:39.620 --> 19:40.500]  Ticked around, mostly.
[19:40.780 --> 19:42.540]  I've been clearing out the rocks at the end of the thing.
[19:43.000 --> 19:43.960]  Now what do we do?
[19:44.420 --> 19:45.920]  Do we melt this white shit?
[19:47.140 --> 19:48.620]  Try it, we could try it. Why not?
[19:51.460 --> 19:52.340]  Okay, we're not.
[19:53.220 --> 19:53.940]  Why, what happened?
[19:54.460 --> 19:56.580]  Nobody said anything. Well, I'm trying to
[19:56.580 --> 19:58.960]  put it in the cart. Yeah, he was...
[19:58.960 --> 20:00.420]  Oh, you know what? That's on me.
[20:00.660 --> 20:01.720]  I didn't see it. Oh, okay.
[20:02.100 --> 20:04.040]  I hear that a lot. I'm beginning to think
[20:04.040 --> 20:04.960]  we need the cart.
[20:06.040 --> 20:07.760]  Well, I don't think you do, but... Yeah.
[20:08.400 --> 20:09.240]  I'm just trying to be cool.
[20:10.080 --> 20:11.360]  I'm tearing it down with you.
[20:11.480 --> 20:13.460]  I got a bunch on the other side already.
[20:14.800 --> 20:15.480]  Alright, let's see if
[20:15.480 --> 20:16.620]  white rock melts.
[20:18.980 --> 20:19.800]  White rock?
[20:21.420 --> 20:22.060]  Crack rock.
[20:22.980 --> 20:24.920]  Oh, yeah. I'd draft it.
[20:25.980 --> 20:27.160]  Don't draft it first, though.
[20:27.180 --> 20:28.380]  You'll get reamed for it.
[20:30.980 --> 20:32.460]  History was on your side on that one.
[20:33.000 --> 20:33.760]  What about divorce?
[20:35.160 --> 20:35.740]  Very big.
[20:36.640 --> 20:37.520]  Very common.
[20:39.380 --> 20:39.860]  Statistically
[20:39.860 --> 20:41.680]  probable. Well, Gavin,
[20:41.740 --> 20:43.760]  it's too big. It's too big, isn't it?
[20:44.080 --> 20:45.000]  White rock don't melt.
[20:46.200 --> 20:47.460]  Well, we don't know that.
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.400]  That lucky...
[20:49.400 --> 20:51.980]  I already burned through all of our group divorces.
[20:53.600 --> 20:55.500]  Yeah, man. I hope we're lucky.
[20:57.060 --> 20:57.860]  Which marriage
[20:57.860 --> 20:59.120]  is statistically the strongest?
[20:59.880 --> 21:00.800]  I think it's gotta be mine.
[21:01.340 --> 21:02.920]  No, I mean like first, second, or third.
[21:04.460 --> 21:05.340]  I imagine...
[21:05.340 --> 21:07.120]  I think it's gotta be mine, because third is the strongest.
[21:07.340 --> 21:08.920]  Yeah, once you hit third, you're like...
[21:08.920 --> 21:10.640]  You're set. Is that right?
[21:10.960 --> 21:13.140]  You've got a guideline of all the things you did wrong
[21:13.140 --> 21:13.580]  to follow.
[21:14.540 --> 21:16.780]  They let you know the whole time.
[21:23.410 --> 21:23.850]  So...
[21:23.850 --> 21:28.090]  Well, it's not rocks.
[21:28.690 --> 21:29.330]  Not rocks.
[21:29.330 --> 21:30.850]  Rock not rock.
[21:32.690 --> 21:35.250]  Do we need to melt the time from the clock?
[21:36.110 --> 21:37.390]  Oh, like fourth dimensional melt?
[21:37.710 --> 21:38.150]  Yeah, maybe.
[21:40.610 --> 21:42.890]  I was gonna say, maybe we need to pull
[21:42.890 --> 21:45.270]  like the iron off of the clock.
[21:45.770 --> 21:47.570]  Oh. Like melt the clock hand?
[21:47.870 --> 21:48.310]  Yeah.
[21:48.950 --> 21:50.670]  I haven't been over there yet.
[21:51.170 --> 21:52.930]  Let's check that out. Ready?
[21:53.510 --> 21:53.730]  Yep.
[21:55.230 --> 21:56.010]  Sorry, Nick!
[21:56.010 --> 21:56.690]  Sorry!
[21:57.890 --> 22:00.190]  Hey, what's up, man?
[22:00.350 --> 22:00.810]  How you doing?
[22:02.530 --> 22:03.330]  We've advanced.
[22:03.770 --> 22:06.170]  Hey, what's up, man? So, I got this one battery
[22:06.170 --> 22:08.130]  filled up. I'm trying to get the other battery going
[22:08.130 --> 22:08.830]  for the elevator.
[22:11.270 --> 22:12.430]  Skip the key, then.
[22:13.290 --> 22:14.110]  No, we've been
[22:14.110 --> 22:15.090]  trying on the key.
[22:15.470 --> 22:18.250]  So, I've got one battery going.
[22:18.730 --> 22:20.210]  You get the battery.
[22:20.830 --> 22:22.070]  Guys, the track! I'm jumping the track!
[22:22.310 --> 22:23.070]  Look to the right!
[22:23.070 --> 22:23.930]  Look to the right!
[22:24.170 --> 22:24.570]  Oh, there he is!
[22:24.790 --> 22:27.750]  He did it! I got it!
[22:28.130 --> 22:29.470]  How did you skip ahead?
[22:30.310 --> 22:31.950]  I went through the mines.
[22:32.230 --> 22:33.750]  In the mines, there's a door.
[22:33.770 --> 22:35.790]  We finished this a long time ago.
[22:36.290 --> 22:37.010]  But we didn't get a key.
[22:38.390 --> 22:39.790]  So, I got
[22:41.390 --> 22:42.190]  one battery,
[22:42.490 --> 22:44.130]  but I can't find the other one.
[22:44.450 --> 22:46.010]  Hey, Gavin. Hey, what's up, man?
[22:46.190 --> 22:48.510]  No, no, you're doing great.
[22:48.750 --> 22:49.570]  You just gotta keep looking.
[22:49.570 --> 22:51.230]  That's what this gear
[22:51.230 --> 22:53.850]  turn thing is for. You put the battery in here, you charge it.
[22:54.290 --> 22:55.510]  And then we just need the second battery.
[22:55.610 --> 22:57.030]  I just don't know where it is.
[23:00.550 --> 23:02.790]  There was one that was in this
[23:03.410 --> 23:05.570]  house castle thing behind a locked
[23:05.570 --> 23:07.630]  door, and I got that out.
[23:09.650 --> 23:10.130]  But...
[23:10.130 --> 23:11.570]  I just don't know
[23:11.570 --> 23:13.370]  where another one would be.
[23:13.710 --> 23:14.970]  And I'm not really sure where to
[23:15.590 --> 23:16.070]  look.
[23:16.630 --> 23:18.070]  Is that a battery over
[23:18.070 --> 23:20.330]  there on the other side of the...
[23:20.330 --> 23:21.090]  Wait, where are you?
[23:22.150 --> 23:23.650]  I'm where the yellow guy was.
[23:25.210 --> 23:26.170]  I'm the yellow guy.
[23:26.950 --> 23:28.050]  I've been the yellow guy every
[23:28.050 --> 23:29.750]  part. Oh, fuck, I just died.
[23:30.210 --> 23:31.050]  Trying to follow the yellow guy.
[23:32.630 --> 23:34.290]  Shit. We'll never know who it was.
[23:34.790 --> 23:36.190]  I mean, the battery looks...
[23:36.190 --> 23:37.610]  It's got blue on one side, red on the other.
[23:37.670 --> 23:39.110]  It looks like a battery.
[23:40.310 --> 23:41.830]  Would you say it looks like a Duracell?
[23:41.830 --> 23:44.270]  Like a 9V, a AA...
[23:44.270 --> 23:44.990]  No, it's like a AA.
[23:45.410 --> 23:46.490]  Oh, I see it, Eric.
[23:46.850 --> 23:47.230]  Where?
[23:48.670 --> 23:52.330]  It's in the house on top of the bookshelves
[23:52.330 --> 23:53.290]  on the second floor.
[23:55.090 --> 23:56.150]  Let me get to it.
[23:57.350 --> 23:58.350]  I'm going where the yellow
[23:58.350 --> 23:58.770]  guy went.
[24:02.530 --> 24:04.150]  Eric, there you go.
[24:06.730 --> 24:07.310]  Oh, never mind.
[24:09.270 --> 24:10.290]  So, Nick, did you
[24:10.290 --> 24:10.950]  grab it and throw it down?
[24:11.630 --> 24:12.790]  Yeah, I'm going to drop it
[24:12.790 --> 24:14.410]  one more time for you.
[24:15.210 --> 24:15.810]  There you go.
[24:17.230 --> 24:17.970]  Oh, cool.
[24:19.950 --> 24:20.710]  I'll just bring it.
[24:20.770 --> 24:22.410]  You can just throw it in this thing.
[24:23.030 --> 24:24.270]  Just line up blue to blue.
[24:24.930 --> 24:26.290]  Blue to blue, got it.
[24:28.390 --> 24:28.950]  Geoff, you want
[24:28.950 --> 24:29.490]  to crank this thing?
[24:31.410 --> 24:32.650]  Crank this hog, dude.
[24:33.110 --> 24:34.550]  Crank this hog. That's Nick.
[24:35.530 --> 24:36.410]  Stop cranking Nick.
[24:36.470 --> 24:37.750]  Stop cranking Nick.
[24:37.750 --> 24:38.430]  That's cranking Nick.
[24:40.570 --> 24:41.610]  Alright, go for it.
[24:42.290 --> 24:43.370]  Spin it in circles, baby.
[24:43.630 --> 24:44.470]  There you go. Crank it.
[24:45.390 --> 24:47.090]  Voltage low. Keep going, man. You got it.
[24:47.230 --> 24:49.890]  And go. Nope, all the way in a circle.
[24:49.970 --> 24:51.150]  You got to go all the way in a circle. You got it.
[24:51.450 --> 24:53.270]  How do you do a full circle? Don't you need somebody
[24:53.270 --> 24:54.150]  to crank the other side?
[24:54.630 --> 24:57.450]  No, you just grab it from the side instead of underneath.
[25:01.550 --> 25:02.750]  Oh, yeah, this way.
[25:03.210 --> 25:05.150]  Can I try and get gummed up in there?
[25:05.150 --> 25:06.930]  Keep it going. Oh, yeah, hop in.
[25:07.730 --> 25:09.150]  Almost there. Almost there. One more.
[25:09.410 --> 25:10.450]  One more. Big turn. Big turn.
[25:11.350 --> 25:12.070]  Oh, Gavin!
[25:12.610 --> 25:15.090]  Big turn. Big turn. Keep turning. Big turn.
[25:16.510 --> 25:17.030]  Keep going.
[25:17.250 --> 25:19.410]  Big turn. Yeah. Oh, you almost had it.
[25:19.430 --> 25:20.870]  Didn't go. Didn't go. You got to go faster.
[25:21.470 --> 25:22.610]  There you go. All the way.
[25:23.010 --> 25:23.610]  There you go.
[25:24.550 --> 25:27.150]  We were cranking hogs. I'm being the weight.
[25:28.010 --> 25:28.990]  You did it. Yeah, keep
[25:29.530 --> 25:30.610]  being the weight in there, buddy.
[25:30.610 --> 25:32.590]  The battery's gone.
[25:33.890 --> 25:34.370]  God!
[25:34.830 --> 25:36.410]  You charged it, amigo. Way to go.
[25:36.490 --> 25:36.870]  Oh, okay.
[25:38.550 --> 25:40.150]  He didn't tell us he was leaving, did he?
[25:41.670 --> 25:42.310]  I never did.
[25:42.610 --> 25:44.670]  Did it open? I've been on my quest.
[25:48.370 --> 25:49.410]  Uh, what?
[25:50.190 --> 25:51.590]  There's a battery in this side.
[25:51.910 --> 25:53.570]  Who changed the battery side?
[25:53.890 --> 25:54.950]  Why would you do that?
[25:55.990 --> 25:57.270]  Like, what was the point?
[25:58.410 --> 26:00.190]  For that, just that two seconds
[26:00.190 --> 26:01.170]  of you going, what?
[26:02.730 --> 26:03.990]  I came in and I just went,
[26:04.150 --> 26:05.530]  this is not where I put this battery.
[26:06.830 --> 26:07.730]  All right, go for it.
[26:08.450 --> 26:09.730]  Oh, Nick! Nick! Nick!
[26:11.150 --> 26:11.690]  I'm alive.
[26:11.950 --> 26:14.350]  I'm trying to get to the battery.
[26:15.370 --> 26:15.790]  You got it, Eric.
[26:16.030 --> 26:17.110]  We did it. We did it.
[26:17.310 --> 26:18.950]  Why are you trying to get to the battery?
[26:19.310 --> 26:19.690]  There we go.
[26:21.490 --> 26:23.810]  I'm ready to ride the lift. Yeah, me too.
[26:24.050 --> 26:24.810]  Same here. Let's ride the lift.
[26:25.890 --> 26:27.350]  God, I hate...
[26:27.350 --> 26:27.990]  I'm riding Nick.
[26:28.490 --> 26:29.830]  I'm gonna ride Gavin.
[26:31.410 --> 26:33.190]  Okay, I'll hold the lift
[26:33.190 --> 26:35.210]  and everyone hold my back and then we'll do
[26:35.210 --> 26:36.730]  a big lift chain. Okay.
[26:42.150 --> 26:44.000]  All right, so someone...
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.640]  Yes! I gotcha!
[26:46.060 --> 26:46.540]  I gotcha!
[26:46.940 --> 26:47.700]  I gotcha!
[26:50.160 --> 26:52.080]  Long live the king.
[26:52.500 --> 26:54.220]  This is how I expect...
[26:55.240 --> 26:57.100]  Long live the king.
[26:57.440 --> 26:58.480]  I mean in crotch, sir.
[26:58.480 --> 26:59.240]  Pull us up!
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.660]  Pull us up!
[27:02.820 --> 27:04.240]  You'll kill us all!
[27:04.620 --> 27:04.900]  No!
[27:05.300 --> 27:07.560]  I'm trying to...
[27:10.140 --> 27:12.040]  Oh, come on, Gavin. You can do it.
[27:12.180 --> 27:13.840]  There's two dogs weighing me down.
[27:14.580 --> 27:15.680]  I just need to...
[27:15.680 --> 27:18.200]  We actually make you lighter.
[27:18.900 --> 27:19.940]  I'll spin you.
[27:20.020 --> 27:20.960]  I'm gonna rotate you.
[27:21.480 --> 27:22.880]  Oh, we're going down!
[27:24.280 --> 27:25.100]  Swing underneath!
[27:25.100 --> 27:25.240]  Swing underneath!
[27:32.320 --> 27:32.800]  Okay.
[27:42.420 --> 27:43.700]  Oh, do you guys need the elevator?
[27:44.600 --> 27:46.620]  Yeah, it's coming back down.
[27:46.920 --> 27:47.960]  Oh, dog yanked!
[27:50.020 --> 27:50.660]  Why, dog?
[27:53.360 --> 27:54.320]  We grabbed...
[27:54.320 --> 27:55.200]  What did we grab?
[27:57.200 --> 27:58.160]  Gavin, you...
[27:58.160 --> 28:00.120]  I'm not doing the buttons.
[28:00.840 --> 28:01.900]  Eric's good at ape shit.
[28:03.480 --> 28:04.660]  He's losing his damn...
[28:05.860 --> 28:06.820]  little mind.
[28:07.140 --> 28:09.060]  Oh, God, baby. I don't have anything to do with that.
[28:11.200 --> 28:12.160]  You're at
[28:12.160 --> 28:13.640]  Andrew's mercy now.
[28:14.500 --> 28:16.520]  Do we go... Do you think we go up or down?
[28:16.940 --> 28:17.520]  I'll start up.
[28:17.520 --> 28:19.880]  I just got the achievement for dying a hundred times.
[28:22.340 --> 28:23.180]  That's pretty good.
[28:24.160 --> 28:25.940]  I'm going down. It doesn't look like there's...
[28:25.940 --> 28:27.420]  Oh, no, this is just the bridge.
[28:27.540 --> 28:29.840]  This is like if you were to come the way of the bridge.
[28:30.020 --> 28:30.960]  Lawn and house is up here.
[28:32.360 --> 28:33.440]  Oh, someone made it.
[28:33.580 --> 28:36.320]  Yeah, who needs it?
[28:36.800 --> 28:38.680]  Maybe there's no ability to make a key.
[28:39.580 --> 28:40.960]  Maybe we need the key in here.
[28:42.020 --> 28:42.560]  Oh, yeah.
[28:42.740 --> 28:44.100]  It's a late game key.
[28:44.100 --> 28:46.520]  Yeah, maybe the key was in the guffin.
[28:46.700 --> 28:47.680]  Oh, there's cables.
[28:47.860 --> 28:48.640]  We need cables.
[28:48.860 --> 28:50.900]  Oh, cool. This is Andrew's specialty.
[28:51.220 --> 28:53.500]  Andrew, look, a blue cable.
[28:54.140 --> 28:55.020]  Andrew, look.
[28:57.540 --> 28:59.760]  I want to see what's out here.
[28:59.880 --> 29:02.260]  What the hell? It's me. I'm out here.
[29:06.040 --> 29:06.480]  Battery.
[29:08.340 --> 29:08.780]  Connection.
[29:09.560 --> 29:10.580]  Andrew's got a cable.
[29:11.640 --> 29:13.020]  What is this?
[29:13.320 --> 29:14.080]  Oh, a magnet.
[29:15.260 --> 29:16.280]  Is this like a bomb or something?
[29:16.820 --> 29:17.300]  Yeah.
[29:18.580 --> 29:19.740]  Hey, Geoff.
[29:20.140 --> 29:22.100]  Come over here.
[29:22.260 --> 29:24.000]  I think we need to do this.
[29:24.600 --> 29:27.580]  And once it's connected, it'll pull that sucker down.
[29:28.520 --> 29:29.260]  Oh, yeah, I see.
[29:29.880 --> 29:30.360]  Interesting.
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.120]  Right? Because that looks like metal.
[29:32.320 --> 29:33.840]  No, I think you're right.
[29:35.260 --> 29:35.540]  In it?
[29:36.060 --> 29:36.840]  In it, yeah.
[29:37.700 --> 29:38.700]  In it is.
[29:38.820 --> 29:39.920]  What do you have, Gavin?
[29:40.540 --> 29:41.760]  Like a grenade or something?
[29:42.800 --> 29:43.260]  He's helping.
[29:44.920 --> 29:46.000]  Yeah, keep doing that.
[29:47.180 --> 29:48.940]  Do you need the whole thing moved?
[29:49.840 --> 29:50.240]  There you go.
[29:50.680 --> 29:51.240]  Pretty good.
[29:52.280 --> 29:54.240]  What would that red thing go to?
[29:54.600 --> 29:55.180]  What is that?
[29:57.500 --> 29:59.060]  Let's move this over just a hair.
[29:59.640 --> 30:01.220]  Maybe we'll find out.
[30:01.340 --> 30:02.180]  It never was connected.
[30:03.480 --> 30:04.840]  Has anyone got any fillings?
[30:06.060 --> 30:06.460]  Yeah.
[30:06.860 --> 30:07.260]  Yeah.
[30:09.460 --> 30:10.280]  How many do you need?
[30:11.120 --> 30:12.240]  Pull that back for a sec.
[30:13.660 --> 30:15.040]  Are you going to plug in the blue today?
[30:15.360 --> 30:16.120]  I would love to.
[30:16.820 --> 30:18.540]  We keep putting it on top of the blue.
[30:19.800 --> 30:20.360]  There we go.
[30:21.700 --> 30:22.700]  There it goes.
[30:22.900 --> 30:25.940]  Holy shit, Eric almost got yanked out.
[30:27.660 --> 30:28.760]  Alright, that's fine, though.
[30:28.780 --> 30:29.800]  Because I got it now, baby.
[30:29.900 --> 30:32.000]  Ah, nope.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.060]  I got it!
[30:34.700 --> 30:35.660]  Did you?
[30:35.880 --> 30:37.200]  Oh, you look cool.
[30:37.260 --> 30:37.840]  Thanks, man.
[30:38.300 --> 30:40.260]  So there's two ways I can go.
[30:41.600 --> 30:43.340]  Get him, boys!
[30:45.240 --> 30:45.960]  No!
[30:47.960 --> 30:48.920]  Andrew missed.
[30:49.460 --> 30:50.960]  Andrew missed.
[30:55.060 --> 30:57.300]  Oh my god.
[30:57.840 --> 30:58.820]  Grab the segment.
[30:59.660 --> 31:01.640]  Oh, you're holding me, you bastard.
[31:02.000 --> 31:02.900]  No, but which hand is it?
[31:02.940 --> 31:04.000]  Is it my left hand? I'm going to let go.
[31:04.360 --> 31:05.440]  It's your left.
[31:06.780 --> 31:07.000]  Oh!
[31:07.920 --> 31:08.720]  Nick sucks.
[31:10.260 --> 31:11.000]  Oh, smart.
[31:12.760 --> 31:13.560]  And go!
[31:17.340 --> 31:18.120]  Almost, buddy.
[31:18.620 --> 31:19.020]  Andrew!
[31:23.720 --> 31:26.420]  Keep doing it. I got a really good camera shot here.
[31:26.500 --> 31:27.160]  This looks great.
[31:27.160 --> 31:29.040]  Up the stairs.
[31:29.520 --> 31:31.320]  You can see the gun in my back pocket.
[31:31.460 --> 31:33.880]  I look ominous. This looks scary when you guys are swinging.
[31:34.020 --> 31:34.580]  It's pretty cool.
[31:34.700 --> 31:35.720]  Alright, Nick, you got this.
[31:37.420 --> 31:38.400]  Swing when you're winning.
[31:40.640 --> 31:41.920]  Alright, Andrew, you got this.
[31:42.020 --> 31:42.380]  I got it.
[31:44.440 --> 31:46.380]  You gotta put your arms out there, buddy.
[31:46.520 --> 31:48.620]  Oh, somebody got access to something.
[31:48.860 --> 31:49.700]  Geoff got it.
[31:50.760 --> 31:51.780]  Let's join Geoff.
[31:54.540 --> 31:54.940]  Swing!
[31:55.480 --> 31:56.880]  I want to swing one more time.
[31:56.940 --> 31:57.340]  Oh!
[31:58.900 --> 31:59.700]  What's up, Geoff?
[32:00.080 --> 32:01.620]  What do we have here?
[32:01.740 --> 32:04.680]  We're going to need some charged batteries.
[32:04.900 --> 32:05.860]  Looks like we're going to need two.
[32:06.520 --> 32:07.120]  Oh, okay.
[32:08.240 --> 32:10.340]  Oh, this door is blocked?
[32:11.040 --> 32:11.980]  Let's look at it.
[32:18.550 --> 32:20.430]  There's a bar on the other side of that door.
[32:20.430 --> 32:21.390]  God damn.
[32:24.170 --> 32:25.530]  We need batteries?
[32:25.550 --> 32:26.410]  Let's go this way, Geoff.
[32:27.570 --> 32:28.290]  Batteries!
[32:35.260 --> 32:36.700]  Oh, yeah.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.060]  It might not be batteries.
[32:40.280 --> 32:41.800]  It might be fuses.
[32:44.360 --> 32:45.080]  Whoa!
[32:45.840 --> 32:47.760]  There's a Frankenstein monster down here.
[32:48.540 --> 32:49.700]  That was really impressive, Andrew.
[32:49.700 --> 32:51.120]  That's pretty cool.
[32:51.880 --> 32:52.780]  Geoff, no!
[32:53.420 --> 32:55.440]  There is a Frankenstein monster down here.
[32:56.120 --> 32:56.860]  No, you got yourself.
[32:56.960 --> 32:59.360]  Okay, I'm going to connect blue.
[33:02.100 --> 33:03.140]  The Frankenstein!
[33:03.900 --> 33:05.000]  That's so cool.
[33:05.640 --> 33:06.140]  Blue's in.
[33:08.400 --> 33:09.880]  I'm going to open this window
[33:09.880 --> 33:11.000]  in case we get a fucking run.
[33:11.460 --> 33:12.780]  We have a red cable somewhere?
[33:14.380 --> 33:15.640]  Not one this length.
[33:16.680 --> 33:17.380]  Do you think...
[33:17.380 --> 33:17.720]  There we go.
[33:18.180 --> 33:20.240]  Do you think it's the other one we need to get?
[33:21.940 --> 33:23.880]  How did you get through this door, Andrew?
[33:24.740 --> 33:26.660]  Geoff and I climbed around the side.
[33:27.220 --> 33:27.440]  Oh.
[33:28.060 --> 33:29.360]  I just went up some stairs.
[33:30.880 --> 33:33.220]  I'm going to hit this elevator button and see.
[33:33.760 --> 33:34.380]  Yeah, why not?
[33:34.680 --> 33:37.320]  I think it goes up or down.
[33:37.920 --> 33:38.720]  Looks like it says up.
[33:39.380 --> 33:39.720]  Down.
[33:41.320 --> 33:42.200]  Well, that...
[33:42.200 --> 33:43.320]  Looks like it says down.
[33:47.040 --> 33:48.860]  How's that Frankenstein looking there, Gavin?
[33:49.040 --> 33:50.160]  I'm trying to give him CPR.
[33:51.340 --> 33:52.920]  If maybe I just...
[33:52.920 --> 33:55.320]  I'm jumping on his dick, so we're both jumping.
[33:55.320 --> 33:55.920]  Wake up, Paige.
[33:56.520 --> 33:56.900]  Oops.
[33:58.620 --> 34:00.640]  There's a lot here.
[34:01.620 --> 34:02.360]  Does he look awake?
[34:03.440 --> 34:04.700]  Yeah, he looks like he's almost there.
[34:04.900 --> 34:05.980]  I see the red cable.
[34:06.720 --> 34:08.660]  I got the fuse, or one of the fuses.
[34:09.360 --> 34:11.420]  Yeah, if you got two fuses down there and the red cable,
[34:11.420 --> 34:12.500]  that's what we're looking for, I think.
[34:14.560 --> 34:15.280]  Wake up!
[34:16.680 --> 34:17.720]  Gavin's trying to rip this
[34:17.720 --> 34:19.640]  Frankenstein's head off, and it's almost working.
[34:20.680 --> 34:21.880]  I think he almost got it.
[34:22.040 --> 34:23.260]  Alright, I'm sending the
[34:24.060 --> 34:25.540]  gondola across if you guys
[34:25.540 --> 34:26.080]  go up.
[34:27.580 --> 34:28.740]  Almost there, I assume.
[34:29.380 --> 34:30.260]  Yeah, I guess so.
[34:30.380 --> 34:30.740]  Alright.
[34:34.260 --> 34:35.560]  I'm just chilling with Frankenstein.
[34:35.620 --> 34:36.460]  I'm going to try to hop in.
[34:37.940 --> 34:39.940]  If you can get in, would you take this?
[34:39.940 --> 34:40.240]  Yeah.
[34:43.240 --> 34:44.940]  Can you grab the red cable?
[34:45.460 --> 34:46.860]  I'm going to try.
[34:48.580 --> 34:49.540]  Is that good?
[34:50.100 --> 34:51.780]  You guys are doing great work over there.
[34:52.060 --> 34:53.420]  This is fantastic. Alright, you ready?
[34:54.880 --> 34:55.980]  Do we need one more,
[34:56.160 --> 34:56.820]  or do we only need one?
[34:56.820 --> 34:58.560]  We need another fuse.
[34:58.800 --> 35:01.600]  There should be two fuses and one red cable.
[35:02.400 --> 35:03.820]  Do you want to start bringing those back,
[35:03.860 --> 35:04.900]  and we'll look for the fuse?
[35:05.980 --> 35:06.380]  Sure.
[35:06.380 --> 35:08.160]  Are you guys sending them up the
[35:08.600 --> 35:09.500]  elevator, or what?
[35:09.840 --> 35:12.060]  We've got to get them across a gondola thing first.
[35:12.280 --> 35:13.800]  I found the next fuse.
[35:14.400 --> 35:14.900]  Oh shit!
[35:16.400 --> 35:18.020]  So, I'm grabbing it.
[35:18.400 --> 35:18.580]  Okay.
[35:20.040 --> 35:21.320]  Alright, thank you.
[35:22.640 --> 35:24.020]  I think Gavin wanted to
[35:24.020 --> 35:25.080]  hop on.
[35:25.900 --> 35:26.920]  No, I was just getting you over.
[35:28.340 --> 35:29.540]  Helping unload, you know.
[35:30.800 --> 35:32.180]  Why'd you stop in the middle then?
[35:32.880 --> 35:34.340]  Because I thought you wanted to send it back.
[35:35.160 --> 35:36.280]  It's kind of your thing.
[35:36.980 --> 35:38.280]  Oh, you know what?
[35:38.320 --> 35:39.960]  I appreciate it. Thank you for thinking of me.
[35:42.320 --> 35:44.360]  Well, Geoff's not back yet, so I was thinking
[35:44.360 --> 35:45.300]  we'll wait.
[35:46.060 --> 35:47.060]  I'm getting close.
[35:48.000 --> 35:48.980]  Alright, I'm back.
[35:50.160 --> 35:51.120]  Sending it back.
[35:52.580 --> 35:53.120]  Alright, Eric.
[35:53.760 --> 35:54.800]  I'm going to send the elevator up.
[35:56.220 --> 35:56.720]  Take it.
[35:57.980 --> 35:59.880]  Then I'll get me inside.
[36:00.180 --> 36:00.520]  Thank you.
[36:01.480 --> 36:01.880]  Alright.
[36:03.340 --> 36:04.600]  It's got a cable
[36:04.600 --> 36:05.520]  and a fuse.
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.780]  Yeah, it's pretty impressive.
[36:09.260 --> 36:09.780]  Dog labor.
[36:13.020 --> 36:14.120]  Shouldn't have sent it so soon.
[36:14.640 --> 36:15.000]  There we go.
[36:17.020 --> 36:17.820]  Now we gotta wait.
[36:19.520 --> 36:20.520]  Alright, I'll start grabbing
[36:20.520 --> 36:21.180]  this stuff. Hang on.
[36:26.100 --> 36:28.600]  Are you going to get crushed right there, or are you going to be free?
[36:29.080 --> 36:30.660]  I'm going to be so strong, I'm going to use
[36:30.660 --> 36:31.760]  this fuse to hold it up.
[36:32.880 --> 36:34.700]  No, no, no, send it back up. I'm not done.
[36:34.860 --> 36:35.180]  What are you doing?
[36:36.260 --> 36:38.320]  I'll tell you when I'm done. Why would you do that?
[36:39.260 --> 36:40.500]  I want to see Gavin get crushed.
[36:40.760 --> 36:42.380]  I saw the little wire, the little cable
[36:42.380 --> 36:43.360]  hanging down off the lift.
[36:44.280 --> 36:44.600]  Stupid.
[36:46.200 --> 36:48.320]  Hang on just a second. Hang on.
[36:48.400 --> 36:50.500]  He got the cable off. Shut the fuck up.
[36:50.680 --> 36:51.180]  Alright, send it down.
[36:54.820 --> 36:56.540]  Were we waiting so you could get on it?
[36:57.560 --> 36:57.960]  No.
[36:58.320 --> 37:00.460]  I had to cross back over to get the fuse
[37:00.460 --> 37:02.440]  and everything. I thought you were
[37:02.440 --> 37:03.900]  getting back on it to come down.
[37:03.980 --> 37:05.680]  I don't want to be down there with you guys.
[37:06.400 --> 37:07.780]  It's pretty cool down here.
[37:08.300 --> 37:10.060]  Gross. Here comes Doom.
[37:10.100 --> 37:10.900]  Watch my strength.
[37:11.820 --> 37:13.200]  Guys and two dogs.
[37:14.760 --> 37:16.100]  Oh, that's bad.
[37:18.200 --> 37:19.940]  It's just like the start of Mission Impossible.
[37:20.520 --> 37:22.100]  Oh yeah, you just got Simon.
[37:22.560 --> 37:24.380]  I got Emilio'd.
[37:24.380 --> 37:25.080]  Emilio'd, yeah.
[37:25.540 --> 37:27.960]  I don't think anyone knew who Simon Pegg was in 1995.
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.160]  Was he in Spaces at that point?
[37:31.660 --> 37:32.060]  Spaced?
[37:32.420 --> 37:33.200]  I think that's what it was called.
[37:33.460 --> 37:34.180]  It was a bit later.
[37:37.180 --> 37:37.980]  Big train.
[37:38.340 --> 37:38.720]  What was that?
[37:39.520 --> 37:40.420]  Red cable's in.
[37:41.620 --> 37:43.220]  Red cable is in.
[37:44.040 --> 37:46.760]  That was so close to going off the edge.
[37:46.900 --> 37:48.140]  Nobody knows what you're talking about.
[37:48.200 --> 37:48.720]  That's crazy.
[37:49.960 --> 37:51.320]  Are you bringing the light? That's nice.
[37:52.560 --> 37:53.680]  Oh, we need extra light.
[37:53.840 --> 37:54.020]  Yeah.
[37:55.180 --> 37:57.800]  Alright, we just need one more fuse and we're done.
[37:58.700 --> 37:59.960]  Moving the panel around.
[38:00.420 --> 38:00.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.080]  How's that possible?
[38:02.440 --> 38:04.080]  Boxing the panel, trying to hit the button.
[38:04.900 --> 38:05.400]  Oh, that's fun.
[38:05.700 --> 38:07.420]  Let's see if I can reach through the bars and grab the wall.
[38:11.300 --> 38:12.340]  Grab the wall right there.
[38:12.760 --> 38:16.400]  Jack! Jack! Jack!
[38:16.800 --> 38:17.040]  Jack! Jack!
[38:18.440 --> 38:19.120]  His head!
[38:19.120 --> 38:20.120]  Oh no!
[38:21.640 --> 38:22.940]  Let's get his head out!
[38:23.180 --> 38:24.960]  We gotta get his head! We got him, he's free!
[38:25.580 --> 38:27.360]  Oh my god, thank you.
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.100]  That was so good.
[38:33.560 --> 38:35.120]  Alright, let's see.
[38:35.340 --> 38:37.680]  The cables are connected, the second fuse is gonna go in.
[38:37.720 --> 38:38.920]  Who's gonna flip the switch?
[38:39.860 --> 38:41.060]  I'm holding him down.
[38:41.760 --> 38:42.960]  Yeah, I got his arm.
[38:44.600 --> 38:45.340]  I got his arm.
[38:45.340 --> 38:45.380]  I got his arm.
[38:47.680 --> 38:48.820]  Hang on, hang on.
[38:49.220 --> 38:50.300]  We got power.
[38:50.820 --> 38:51.420]  We're holding him.
[38:53.580 --> 38:54.460]  Get it in, Eric!
[38:55.660 --> 38:56.060]  Come on.
[38:56.560 --> 38:58.520]  Come on, get the other side.
[38:59.160 --> 39:00.220]  Get it the god damn in!
[39:00.580 --> 39:01.740]  Our powers combine.
[39:02.940 --> 39:03.900]  Frankenstein's monster.
[39:08.920 --> 39:10.140]  God damn it.
[39:14.020 --> 39:15.620]  Real sick of flipping this switch.
[39:15.620 --> 39:17.500]  Oh, here we go, that's something.
[39:17.880 --> 39:18.860]  There you go.
[39:20.160 --> 39:22.100]  Oh, he's smoking!
[39:22.220 --> 39:22.820]  We're smoking!
[39:23.460 --> 39:23.740]  Oh no!
[39:24.720 --> 39:30.700]  What the hell?
[39:31.220 --> 39:33.040]  We're flying through space!
[39:33.240 --> 39:34.060]  We're absolutely flying.
[39:35.540 --> 39:36.960]  Holy shit!
[39:37.200 --> 39:38.280]  Oh my god.
[39:39.880 --> 39:41.380]  I got an achievement for that.
[39:42.120 --> 39:42.600]  God.
[39:42.980 --> 39:43.460]  Keep the weight.
[39:44.640 --> 39:46.720]  Now this is the counterbalance challenge.
[39:46.720 --> 39:47.380]  Go for it.
[39:48.640 --> 39:49.860]  There's not enough weight.
[39:50.220 --> 39:52.340]  I'm going, I'm going.
[39:52.600 --> 39:58.080]  Did you make it?
[39:58.280 --> 39:59.200]  Oh, you got it.
[40:01.440 --> 40:02.120]  Thanks.
[40:03.800 --> 40:04.180]  Thanks.
[40:06.620 --> 40:07.980]  Keep pulling.
[40:08.360 --> 40:10.260]  My freaking neck, son.
[40:10.260 --> 40:11.320]  I'm close, I'm close.
[40:14.980 --> 40:17.340]  Yeah, there you go.
[40:17.380 --> 40:18.820]  You just need to grab with your left hand, Andrew.
[40:19.080 --> 40:20.540]  I'm trying to reach, I'm trying to reach.
[40:21.320 --> 40:22.380]  You gotta spin.
[40:23.600 --> 40:25.400]  I'm grabbing the platform through myself.
[40:26.440 --> 40:27.480]  You've tied me in a knot.
[40:27.900 --> 40:28.700]  I'm like a pretzel.
[40:29.460 --> 40:29.780]  Ready?
[40:32.780 --> 40:34.160]  Hazmat Pretzel would be a great nickname.
[40:36.140 --> 40:36.780]  Alright, buddy.
[40:36.780 --> 40:38.060]  Next year, appreciate it.
[40:38.240 --> 40:39.800]  Dude, no sweat, I got you.
[40:40.440 --> 40:41.600]  Geoff, Geoff, I got you.
[40:41.600 --> 40:44.200]  Good job, buddy.
[40:44.440 --> 40:44.720]  Me and you, bro.
[40:44.900 --> 40:47.520]  That was great.
[40:48.960 --> 40:51.340]  That was honestly really easy.
[40:51.420 --> 40:52.300]  Hey, Eric, catch me.
[40:53.220 --> 40:53.420]  Okay.
[40:54.500 --> 40:54.920]  Where are you?
[40:56.480 --> 40:57.120]  Arms are out.
[40:58.040 --> 40:59.760]  I don't even jump.
[41:00.460 --> 41:00.620]  Nope.
[41:01.200 --> 41:01.560]  Go!
[41:04.920 --> 41:06.400]  Hank, we gotta move this barrel.
[41:06.680 --> 41:07.820]  Gotta get that barrel out of the way.
[41:08.200 --> 41:09.540]  We got the barrel we needed.
[41:10.400 --> 41:11.720]  There's a big rock there, Eric.
[41:13.180 --> 41:14.580]  You wanna pull it this way?
[41:15.800 --> 41:16.120]  Towards?
[41:16.460 --> 41:16.620]  Yeah.
[41:18.760 --> 41:20.920]  What did you guys think was gonna happen?
[41:20.940 --> 41:22.460]  We can put this under it, though, Eric.
[41:22.660 --> 41:23.820]  So it doesn't swing back.
[41:24.740 --> 41:25.960]  Do we need it not to swing back?
[41:27.320 --> 41:28.220]  That's a good question.
[41:28.220 --> 41:29.180]  Where are we supposed to go?
[41:29.800 --> 41:30.680]  Mostly it goes left and right.
[41:30.720 --> 41:31.200]  Oh, shit!
[41:34.100 --> 41:35.880]  See? It goes left and right like that.
[41:36.040 --> 41:36.400]  Oh, I see.
[41:36.460 --> 41:37.560]  Pretty easy, right?
[41:38.680 --> 41:39.040]  Yeah.
[41:41.260 --> 41:44.220]  I just don't know...
[41:46.300 --> 41:47.300]  You know what?
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.100]  If I do this...
[41:50.100 --> 41:51.940]  Is this barrel what was in the truck?
[41:52.380 --> 41:52.520]  Yeah.
[41:54.460 --> 41:56.520]  We probably need the barrel over to the side or something.
[41:56.520 --> 41:57.820]  That's kind of what I was thinking, too.
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.880]  I thought we were still trying to get in the truck.
[42:00.960 --> 42:02.000]  I didn't see anything come out of the truck.
[42:02.100 --> 42:03.180]  I was trying to catch Gavin.
[42:04.340 --> 42:06.520]  So now we need the barrel to...
[42:07.100 --> 42:08.020]  Underneath this thing?
[42:09.180 --> 42:09.760]  Get over that?
[42:10.040 --> 42:11.420]  Use the barrel to get over this thing?
[42:12.300 --> 42:13.100]  Oh, shit.
[42:15.720 --> 42:16.000]  That?
[42:16.540 --> 42:16.920]  Hold on.
[42:18.320 --> 42:18.620]  Okay.
[42:20.160 --> 42:21.580]  If we pull it back...
[42:22.520 --> 42:23.800]  And then I'll grab.
[42:23.800 --> 42:25.880]  And then roll it forwards and it will pull me up.
[42:26.480 --> 42:27.200]  Oh, yeah.
[42:27.820 --> 42:28.620]  Okay, roll it.
[42:29.920 --> 42:31.000]  Roll it towards the thing.
[42:31.820 --> 42:32.680]  I mean, we can't...
[42:32.680 --> 42:35.600]  I don't know how you roll it.
[42:35.620 --> 42:36.640]  Pull it down from the other side.
[42:37.120 --> 42:37.460]  I'm trying.
[42:39.300 --> 42:40.560]  That's it. Keep going.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.960]  I'm up. I fell.
[42:43.380 --> 42:43.720]  Keep going.
[42:46.100 --> 42:47.080]  A little bit more.
[42:47.260 --> 42:47.700]  That's it.
[42:48.580 --> 42:49.280]  Get up there.
[42:50.440 --> 42:51.100]  Get up there.
[42:51.200 --> 42:51.560]  You're gonna do it.
[42:51.560 --> 42:53.720]  There you go.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.380]  There you go.
[42:57.460 --> 42:58.100]  Ah, shit.
[42:59.220 --> 42:59.680]  Did you do it?
[43:00.840 --> 43:01.180]  Yep.
[43:01.860 --> 43:04.140]  You're gonna find out you need this pipe, right?
[43:04.460 --> 43:05.380]  Oh, yeah. I need the pipe.
[43:05.720 --> 43:06.400]  Oh, yeah.
[43:08.080 --> 43:09.640]  You're gonna find out.
[43:12.340 --> 43:15.120]  I already looked over the fence a while ago.
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.160]  This is a big situation.
[43:17.960 --> 43:18.940]  I don't know how we're supposed to...
[43:18.940 --> 43:20.660]  What if...
[43:20.660 --> 43:22.960]  What if you just grab the one end like this?
[43:23.980 --> 43:24.580]  There you go.
[43:24.760 --> 43:25.900]  Oh, yeah. That's it.
[43:26.320 --> 43:29.080]  To me...
[43:29.080 --> 43:29.880]  To one of us.
[43:30.200 --> 43:31.540]  To one of us.
[43:31.980 --> 43:33.780]  To one of us.
[43:34.000 --> 43:34.880]  You fucking dummies.
[43:35.980 --> 43:38.640]  I thought Geoff was right.
[43:39.160 --> 43:40.140]  You guys are so dumb.
[43:41.040 --> 43:41.560]  Go quick.
[43:41.560 --> 43:42.400]  Go quick.
[43:43.940 --> 43:46.680]  Yeah, you need that pipe.
[43:46.800 --> 43:47.460]  It's right there.
[43:47.780 --> 43:50.200]  He said you're gonna find out.
[43:50.340 --> 43:52.460]  We don't need it for that gate, though.
[43:53.280 --> 43:53.900]  Yeah, but we need it.
[43:54.820 --> 43:56.780]  Obviously, we need it.
[43:58.820 --> 43:59.220]  Okay.
[44:00.640 --> 44:01.540]  Why is that closed now?
[44:03.060 --> 44:04.160]  I took the pipe.
[44:06.080 --> 44:07.020]  No, that pipe...
[44:08.240 --> 44:08.640]  Guys...
[44:08.640 --> 44:09.700]  The other way.
[44:11.440 --> 44:12.900]  Yeah, this is gonna work.
[44:13.120 --> 44:13.740]  Check this out.
[44:14.580 --> 44:14.920]  Okay.
[44:17.020 --> 44:17.820]  That's good.
[44:17.920 --> 44:19.200]  Then you flip and you go back.
[44:21.620 --> 44:22.340]  Good job.
[44:23.440 --> 44:25.000]  Andrew, you have a problem with it?
[44:25.600 --> 44:26.640]  No, not at all.
[44:27.000 --> 44:28.360]  Everybody seemed to until it worked.
[44:29.440 --> 44:30.660]  Everybody seemed to.
[44:30.700 --> 44:32.740]  I stood quietly over to the side.
[44:33.060 --> 44:34.440]  Judgmentally waiting to pounce.
[44:34.680 --> 44:35.400]  I know that quiet.
[44:35.400 --> 44:38.140]  I was waiting.
[44:38.400 --> 44:39.720]  You guys had a plan?
[44:40.060 --> 44:40.400]  You had it all.
[44:41.700 --> 44:42.940]  Oh, dude, I'll roll a barrel.
[44:43.800 --> 44:44.580]  Can I get on it?
[44:44.780 --> 44:46.680]  Go for it.
[44:46.760 --> 44:48.880]  You just grab and then I'll push.
[44:49.360 --> 44:50.120]  That's it.
[44:51.800 --> 44:52.720]  Oh, God.
[44:53.800 --> 44:54.220]  Grab me.
[44:55.660 --> 44:55.720]  Awesome.
[44:58.940 --> 44:59.860]  So cool.
[45:00.520 --> 45:01.520]  Way to go, guys.
[45:01.520 --> 45:03.400]  You see Nick...
[45:03.400 --> 45:05.720]  Dick down my throat as we rolled over.
[45:06.980 --> 45:07.660]  Nick what?
[45:08.340 --> 45:08.920]  Yeah, what happened?
[45:09.720 --> 45:11.480]  Do you ever think, like,
[45:12.060 --> 45:13.380]  you should know more about...
[45:13.380 --> 45:15.500]  I should know what a flange is, I think.
[45:15.700 --> 45:16.520]  Age 36.
[45:17.340 --> 45:19.320]  But what exactly is a flange?
[45:19.680 --> 45:21.740]  Why don't you take one second to Google it and find out
[45:21.740 --> 45:22.240]  and then you'll know.
[45:22.940 --> 45:23.180]  Yeah.
[45:25.280 --> 45:26.760]  But do you know what a flange is?
[45:27.320 --> 45:28.960]  No. I mean, yeah.
[45:29.380 --> 45:30.860]  Why would I Google it?
[45:31.500 --> 45:32.380]  I can't tell you.
[45:32.640 --> 45:33.520]  It's up to you.
[45:33.980 --> 45:36.480]  A flange is the kind of thing that you gotta find out about on your own.
[45:37.240 --> 45:37.840]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[45:37.920 --> 45:38.820]  I don't know when.
[45:40.200 --> 45:42.080]  I could Google it now, but that's just not how
[45:43.140 --> 45:44.420]  I expected to learn it.
[45:46.060 --> 45:46.800]  Like you want to be
[45:46.800 --> 45:48.860]  confronted with a flange problem.
[45:49.720 --> 45:49.760]  Yeah.
[45:50.040 --> 45:51.860]  I could figure out what a flange is and just be like,
[45:51.940 --> 45:53.040]  now I know about a flange.
[45:53.420 --> 45:55.280]  Dude, I understand and respect that. I really do.
[45:55.680 --> 45:56.980]  So Eric, how are you gonna get that blue pipe down?
[45:57.740 --> 45:59.080]  I'm just waiting for Nick
[45:59.080 --> 46:00.740]  to move this all the way to the end.
[46:00.760 --> 46:03.420]  And then we'll see what we can do.
[46:06.080 --> 46:07.220]  Maybe a flange?
[46:10.040 --> 46:10.920]  Because if the barrel
[46:10.920 --> 46:13.040]  goes all the way to the end, you should be able
[46:13.040 --> 46:14.940]  to either jump up it
[46:14.940 --> 46:15.500]  or
[46:17.120 --> 46:18.800]  have it go like that. Hang on.
[46:19.340 --> 46:20.420]  I see. Yeah.
[46:20.920 --> 46:21.800]  Holy shit.
[46:22.820 --> 46:23.360]  Pretty smart.
[46:24.000 --> 46:24.800]  Pretty smart.
[46:25.020 --> 46:26.360]  Check out the big brain on Eric.
[46:26.720 --> 46:27.780]  Pretty smart.
[46:28.900 --> 46:31.460]  But anyway, yeah. Look up what a flange is I guess.
[46:33.180 --> 46:34.360]  Do we sell flanges?
[46:34.900 --> 46:36.040]  Like regulation flanges?
[46:37.460 --> 46:38.860]  I mean that'd be up to you because I don't know.
[46:39.540 --> 46:40.920]  If Gavin could tell me what they are,
[46:41.080 --> 46:41.780]  then yeah, probably.
[46:42.260 --> 46:45.480]  What if we made the world's premier flange?
[46:46.340 --> 46:47.540]  Like what we did for the bread clip?
[46:48.300 --> 46:48.980]  Yeah, kind of.
[46:49.240 --> 46:51.080]  Like you wouldn't know it.
[46:52.060 --> 46:52.540]  Uh...
[46:53.580 --> 46:54.540]  Comedy podcast.
[46:54.660 --> 46:56.780]  Comedy podcast and military
[46:56.780 --> 46:57.780]  industrial flanges.
[46:59.940 --> 47:01.320]  There's not a jet fighter
[47:01.320 --> 47:02.800]  on the runway without three
[47:02.800 --> 47:04.920]  regulation flanges. Without a uniform
[47:04.920 --> 47:05.500]  flange.
[47:07.120 --> 47:07.600]  Uniflange.
[47:08.800 --> 47:10.320]  Flange farm. Nice.
[47:10.740 --> 47:13.140]  That was so good. I don't know if you meant to do that, but that was amazing.
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.380]  No, absolutely not.
[47:14.820 --> 47:15.060]  Alright.
[47:16.140 --> 47:19.080]  I assume we need to slide it so we can get up to the...
[47:19.080 --> 47:19.700]  Okay.
[47:22.180 --> 47:22.540]  Yeah.
[47:23.380 --> 47:24.100]  Got it?
[47:24.420 --> 47:25.540]  Alright, go for it.
[47:26.640 --> 47:28.760]  I don't trust you at all, but I'll do it.
[47:31.980 --> 47:33.160]  Oh, I almost had that too.
[47:33.320 --> 47:33.440]  Damn.
[47:36.660 --> 47:37.140]  Gavin's just
[47:37.140 --> 47:38.300]  not a team player, you know what I mean?
[47:38.960 --> 47:41.020]  Not at first. I'm a second attempt team
[47:41.020 --> 47:41.500]  player though.
[47:43.380 --> 47:44.320]  It's like the Jeb attempt.
[47:44.320 --> 47:44.740]  Ah!
[47:45.600 --> 47:46.040]  Ah!
[47:47.760 --> 47:48.820]  Is this open?
[47:50.080 --> 47:51.520]  Hang on. Is this open?
[47:52.800 --> 47:53.660]  Oh, are you cooking?
[47:54.220 --> 47:55.600]  It does. This does open.
[47:55.940 --> 47:58.020]  Oh, yeah. We should light that bad boy up.
[47:58.740 --> 47:59.280]  Yeah, baby.
[47:59.640 --> 48:02.040]  I think that's probably what we're supposed to do.
[48:02.460 --> 48:03.240]  Alright, I'll hold.
[48:04.660 --> 48:05.840]  Ready? Yep.
[48:06.480 --> 48:06.940]  Oh, wow.
[48:07.360 --> 48:09.060]  Just straight through the side.
[48:11.040 --> 48:11.820]  Good job, Nick.
[48:11.820 --> 48:12.860]  Grab the flames.
[48:13.500 --> 48:15.000]  Hold on, let me...
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.280]  Is there a torch?
[48:19.580 --> 48:20.660]  Can we use these planks?
[48:20.880 --> 48:22.140]  Yeah, can we use these planks there?
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.200]  I don't know.
[48:26.060 --> 48:28.040]  What if I light myself on fire?
[48:28.120 --> 48:29.440]  Is that something? You can try it.
[48:30.360 --> 48:31.480]  Doesn't appear to be something.
[48:32.440 --> 48:33.220]  You didn't start the fire.
[48:34.300 --> 48:35.840]  What if I hold a piece...
[48:35.840 --> 48:37.540]  What if I bring a piece of coal over
[48:37.540 --> 48:38.420]  if this doesn't light?
[48:40.980 --> 48:41.340]  Light.
[48:41.900 --> 48:43.320]  Are they up?
[48:43.760 --> 48:44.580]  Or are they just chilling?
[48:45.840 --> 48:46.900]  I can't tell.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.140]  Oh, I see smoke on this.
[48:49.140 --> 48:51.060]  Oh, it's in there. It's on fire for sure.
[48:51.240 --> 48:52.400]  Is it? Is it on fire?
[48:53.060 --> 48:53.100]  Okay.
[48:54.740 --> 48:57.280]  Oh, boy. I don't know how you're going to bring that over.
[48:57.940 --> 48:58.820]  Just walk it back over.
[48:59.660 --> 49:00.720]  Well, I can't just walk it.
[49:03.280 --> 49:03.940]  There's a gap.
[49:05.140 --> 49:05.500]  There's a gap.
[49:14.120 --> 49:15.180]  Brown dog just...
[49:16.700 --> 49:18.580]  Wait, there's a lower level over there.
[49:18.660 --> 49:19.660]  Maybe we can have someone...
[49:19.660 --> 49:20.200]  No!
[49:22.620 --> 49:23.780]  Oh, I can't
[49:23.780 --> 49:25.440]  go over and hand it across?
[49:25.720 --> 49:26.560]  Oh, yeah.
[49:26.880 --> 49:27.960]  Give that a shot.
[49:29.440 --> 49:31.120]  Okay, let me light it up and then
[49:31.120 --> 49:32.680]  I'll meet whoever on the lower tier.
[49:32.860 --> 49:33.720]  I'll be over here.
[49:34.020 --> 49:37.360]  See if it works. Yeah, let's give it a shot.
[49:38.340 --> 49:39.500]  But I need someone.
[49:39.620 --> 49:41.460]  I need Gavin or someone to come over here
[49:41.460 --> 49:42.520]  so I can hand it up to them.
[49:44.080 --> 49:44.400]  Okay.
[49:46.020 --> 49:47.380]  I thought you would just jump out the window
[49:47.380 --> 49:47.960]  you went through.
[49:50.580 --> 49:51.460]  Well, you can't really
[49:51.460 --> 49:53.160]  jump with this in your hand, can you? Okay.
[49:56.160 --> 49:57.840]  I'm trying. I'm getting as close as I can, man.
[49:57.960 --> 49:59.460]  This is great. Great. Great. You're doing it.
[49:59.860 --> 50:01.340]  You're doing it. I'm trying.
[50:01.800 --> 50:02.440]  I'm going for it!
[50:06.390 --> 50:06.710]  Alright.
[50:07.110 --> 50:08.230]  White dog, we need you.
[50:10.590 --> 50:11.230]  Working on it.
[50:13.030 --> 50:13.390]  Ew.
[50:13.830 --> 50:14.250]  Oh, fuck!
[50:15.550 --> 50:16.130]  Oh, shit.
[50:17.130 --> 50:19.390]  Can we get two people to just stand on the counterweight
[50:19.390 --> 50:20.750]  over here? Would that be easier? I'll do it.
[50:20.750 --> 50:22.050]  Yeah, I'm jumping on it.
[50:22.970 --> 50:25.490]  Are you going to make that jump? I'm on it.
[50:25.710 --> 50:27.090]  I'm just going to hold it across.
[50:29.110 --> 50:29.890]  Yeah, you can do that.
[50:30.270 --> 50:32.950]  I got this. I'm holding it.
[50:33.030 --> 50:33.870]  If you want to try to go.
[50:36.630 --> 50:37.770]  Why are you moving it?
[50:37.770 --> 50:38.610]  Why are you moving it?
[50:39.890 --> 50:40.810]  You silly bollocks.
[50:45.940 --> 50:47.300]  Oh, I got it.
[50:47.600 --> 50:50.020]  Oh, no! Gavin, what are you doing?
[50:50.260 --> 50:51.200]  It pulled me off.
[50:52.100 --> 50:52.600]  Let go of it!
[50:55.200 --> 50:55.660]  Shit.
[50:56.980 --> 50:57.940]  Alright, we can do the
[50:57.940 --> 50:59.100]  transfer down here.
[50:59.500 --> 50:59.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:03.180 --> 51:03.640]  Alright.
[51:05.900 --> 51:06.360]  Gavin?
[51:06.360 --> 51:06.460]  Gavin?
[51:08.400 --> 51:09.820]  Gavin's not even on the...
[51:11.960 --> 51:13.400]  Put it in my hand.
[51:13.680 --> 51:16.140]  Why are you cliffhanging? You're not going to be able to get up.
[51:22.170 --> 51:23.350]  It didn't work.
[51:23.550 --> 51:24.150]  Oh, shit!
[51:26.210 --> 51:26.530]  Wait.
[51:27.350 --> 51:28.790]  How did that happen?
[51:29.250 --> 51:31.590]  What happened?
[51:32.150 --> 51:33.690]  We flipped the...
[51:33.690 --> 51:34.750]  Oh, who could even say?
[51:35.270 --> 51:36.530]  We flipped that thing around.
[51:36.530 --> 51:38.130]  Oh, so now there's no gap on that side?
[51:38.990 --> 51:40.590]  Yeah, but there's a gap on this other side.
[51:40.790 --> 51:42.490]  Yeah, but you can put somebody
[51:42.490 --> 51:44.550]  on it now and catapult them across.
[51:45.230 --> 51:45.630]  Whoops!
[51:48.990 --> 51:49.790]  Like that.
[51:50.590 --> 51:51.950]  That is like that.
[51:52.290 --> 51:54.410]  Gavin, swing back. There you go.
[51:54.550 --> 51:54.770]  Let go!
[51:57.130 --> 51:58.530]  Someone has to go...
[52:00.870 --> 52:01.630]  There you go.
[52:02.490 --> 52:04.050]  Someone has to grab
[52:04.850 --> 52:05.410]  that
[52:07.950 --> 52:08.510]  platform
[52:08.510 --> 52:09.510]  from that side.
[52:10.030 --> 52:11.870]  Slide it over to where
[52:11.870 --> 52:13.110]  Andrew is.
[52:14.090 --> 52:14.910]  And then... Hang on.
[52:15.850 --> 52:17.410]  How can we do this?
[52:18.130 --> 52:20.290]  Nick, if you get on it...
[52:20.290 --> 52:21.270]  What if I lift it?
[52:22.510 --> 52:22.970]  Will that help?
[52:23.310 --> 52:24.890]  No, no, no.
[52:25.210 --> 52:28.030]  One person needs to get on it.
[52:28.170 --> 52:28.710]  Yeah, exactly.
[52:28.870 --> 52:31.550]  I'll run forward and catapult you when you're ready.
[52:31.550 --> 52:31.650]  Okay.
[52:33.310 --> 52:35.410]  It should be level.
[52:35.970 --> 52:36.630]  How about I hold it?
[52:37.190 --> 52:38.570]  Alright, so dog should go.
[52:40.450 --> 52:41.250]  And then...
[52:41.250 --> 52:42.870]  Why is dog going nuts?
[52:43.070 --> 52:44.050]  There you go. That's it.
[52:45.510 --> 52:46.950]  We just needed...
[52:48.110 --> 52:48.510]  Fire!
[52:49.210 --> 52:50.910]  We just needed the gap to be on the other side.
[52:51.050 --> 52:51.650]  Doggy do.
[52:52.890 --> 52:54.050]  I got a nose for this.
[52:55.230 --> 52:56.230]  You did it.
[52:56.870 --> 52:57.770]  Alright, who's with me?
[52:57.770 --> 52:59.350]  Me. Let's go.
[52:59.370 --> 52:59.750]  You ready?
[53:01.850 --> 53:03.510]  You shouldn't have waited.
[53:04.630 --> 53:06.070]  I was waiting for you.
[53:06.510 --> 53:08.190]  I was waiting for you.
[53:11.610 --> 53:13.470]  I'm going to grab Nick in mid-air.
[53:13.830 --> 53:15.330]  I'm going to land on you big stuff.
[53:17.650 --> 53:18.690]  We squished.
[53:20.010 --> 53:21.050]  Get up!
[53:21.690 --> 53:22.150]  Ready, Gavin?
[53:24.310 --> 53:25.130]  I missed.
[53:25.130 --> 53:26.390]  Do we need the plank?
[53:27.630 --> 53:29.010]  The barrel keeps falling.
[53:29.450 --> 53:30.590]  I think so.
[53:31.230 --> 53:32.390]  We need the plank.
[53:32.490 --> 53:34.570]  It needs to go across this because it'll catch the barrel.
[53:34.750 --> 53:36.010]  Go down here and then we climb the barrel.
[53:38.750 --> 53:39.950]  There you go.
[53:40.350 --> 53:42.210]  And then just stay in the middle across.
[53:46.890 --> 53:48.630]  Nick, what are you doing?
[53:50.170 --> 53:51.290]  I'm trying to live, man.
[53:51.290 --> 53:51.930]  I'm trying to live.
[53:52.330 --> 53:52.930]  You ready?
[53:54.550 --> 53:55.910]  Let go.
[54:04.590 --> 54:08.570]  That was really impressive that Nick blew it so hard.
[54:11.030 --> 54:14.370]  Every step of the way there was a mess.
[54:17.410 --> 54:19.570]  Why are you doing it from the front?
[54:19.570 --> 54:20.630]  Nick, grab the barrel.
[54:21.510 --> 54:22.210]  You got it.
[54:27.330 --> 54:28.470]  Watch Nick catch this.
[54:28.850 --> 54:30.990]  Gavin and Geoff, you guys need to move.
[54:31.830 --> 54:33.930]  You guys need to move because it's going to roll down that way.
[54:34.170 --> 54:34.990]  Somebody grab, quick.
[54:35.410 --> 54:36.410]  We got it.
[54:39.410 --> 54:41.730]  Gavin, it should just hit and roll down this way.
[54:41.890 --> 54:42.610]  Yeah, but watch me catch it.
[54:43.410 --> 54:45.370]  It's off-centered. It's going to bounce off.
[54:46.490 --> 54:47.210]  We got it.
[54:50.110 --> 54:50.690]  Oh, shit.
[54:50.950 --> 54:51.750]  Guys, we got it.
[54:53.910 --> 54:55.370]  We don't need it like this.
[55:02.250 --> 55:03.710]  I do agree that it's off-center.
[55:03.810 --> 55:04.930]  I don't think it's going to...
[55:04.930 --> 55:05.110]  Oh, wow.
[55:06.210 --> 55:07.310]  We had a call last time.
[55:10.770 --> 55:11.390]  There we go.
[55:13.510 --> 55:13.970]  Look out, Nick.
[55:14.710 --> 55:15.670]  I don't know. I see it.
[55:16.810 --> 55:17.710]  Big rolly barrel.
[55:17.710 --> 55:19.630]  Oh, shit.
[55:29.760 --> 55:31.940]  Get off of me.
[55:34.200 --> 55:34.880]  Oh, Geoff.
[55:38.780 --> 55:41.360]  I know when I've been playing this too long,
[55:41.420 --> 55:42.920]  when the climbing is easy.
[55:43.200 --> 55:43.980]  When it feels right.
[55:44.480 --> 55:46.820]  When I've got the mechanics down,
[55:46.820 --> 55:49.900]  that's when I know that I need to take a break from this game.
[55:50.060 --> 55:52.020]  Intuitive climbing is not your bag in this?
[55:52.180 --> 55:52.320]  Yeah.
[55:53.480 --> 55:54.020]  What the?
[55:54.840 --> 55:56.120]  Who went over there? Is that Geoff?
[55:56.260 --> 55:57.800]  Hey, what's up? I'm Geoff.
[55:58.760 --> 56:00.560]  Yeah, are you supposed to just go over the wall or something?
[56:01.600 --> 56:02.440]  Yeah, I think so.
[56:03.000 --> 56:03.820]  Yeah, it's chained.
[56:04.180 --> 56:06.860]  Oh, dude, this dog's on the other side of the fence.
[56:06.900 --> 56:07.380]  What's up, dog?
[56:08.280 --> 56:09.380]  This dog can't even get me.
[56:10.320 --> 56:11.400]  Andrew, come over here.
[56:11.520 --> 56:12.900]  Geoff, come over to the fence.
[56:13.500 --> 56:14.940]  Both of you guys come over to the fence.
[56:15.920 --> 56:16.740]  Two dogs.
[56:29.800 --> 56:31.480]  Gavin, what happened to that ladder?
[56:32.100 --> 56:33.000]  It came apart a little.
[56:33.280 --> 56:33.660]  Oh, okay.
[56:34.340 --> 56:36.920]  The ladder needs to come over to this side
[56:36.920 --> 56:39.160]  so we can get these pipes down, I think.
[56:39.240 --> 56:40.420]  Can we get through the opening?
[56:40.420 --> 56:41.440]  Breaking the ladder.
[56:42.820 --> 56:44.720]  You think it'll fit?
[56:45.100 --> 56:45.660]  I think maybe.
[56:46.300 --> 56:47.480]  Dude, there's nothing.
[56:47.700 --> 56:49.180]  What happened to it?
[56:50.640 --> 56:52.480]  The building fell on someone.
[56:52.900 --> 56:54.500]  I just broke one of the buildings.
[56:54.940 --> 56:56.320]  Wow, how'd you do that?
[56:56.780 --> 56:58.180]  I jumped at it.
[57:00.040 --> 57:01.220]  Keep swinging, dog.
[57:01.440 --> 57:03.100]  There we go.
[57:05.820 --> 57:06.340]  Uh...
[57:07.860 --> 57:08.380]  Uh...
[57:08.700 --> 57:11.240]  So now we have an L-pipe.
[57:12.400 --> 57:12.920]  Gavin,
[57:13.100 --> 57:14.020]  use me as a springboard.
[57:16.280 --> 57:18.720]  Do you think we hand it over the wall?
[57:20.240 --> 57:20.600]  Oh, yeah.
[57:22.600 --> 57:23.260]  Oh, yeah.
[57:23.360 --> 57:23.700]  Do you need a hand?
[57:24.180 --> 57:25.520]  You're doing it.
[57:27.260 --> 57:28.080]  There you go.
[57:28.880 --> 57:30.280]  I wish this chain wasn't here.
[57:30.280 --> 57:31.820]  Why would you pull it back?
[57:31.820 --> 57:33.360]  Why would you pull it back?
[57:34.380 --> 57:35.800]  Oh, somebody just arrived to help.
[57:36.000 --> 57:36.880]  Just drop that down.
[57:38.420 --> 57:39.320]  You can do it.
[57:39.640 --> 57:41.340]  I'm taking Gavin over the edge.
[57:41.480 --> 57:43.220]  He made me mad. You go to hell.
[57:43.460 --> 57:43.740]  Come here.
[57:45.420 --> 57:46.400]  You're in air jail.
[57:48.080 --> 57:48.560]  Amazing.
[57:49.780 --> 57:50.580]  Andrew, let go.
[57:51.860 --> 57:52.740]  Hell yeah.
[57:54.940 --> 57:56.540]  So we do this here?
[57:56.800 --> 57:57.920]  Yeah, I believe so.
[58:01.620 --> 58:03.960]  Oh, wait.
[58:03.960 --> 58:06.020]  These don't fit.
[58:08.580 --> 58:10.320]  Maybe put this one here?
[58:11.640 --> 58:12.320]  And these move.
[58:12.500 --> 58:13.600]  Take that one off.
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.160]  Oh, my God.
[58:15.500 --> 58:16.720]  Good luck with this shit.
[58:17.220 --> 58:19.380]  We got it.
[58:20.380 --> 58:20.940]  Immediately.
[58:23.640 --> 58:24.340]  We'll figure it out.
[58:25.400 --> 58:27.180]  What is this?
[58:27.180 --> 58:28.500]  Oh, this is the pistol.
[58:28.720 --> 58:29.280]  It'll open.
[58:30.580 --> 58:32.920]  There's a lot of pieces of this that come off.
[58:34.120 --> 58:34.740]  Don't worry.
[58:34.800 --> 58:35.780]  Andrew has this ladder.
[58:37.360 --> 58:39.140]  It looks like this one also removes.
[58:39.160 --> 58:39.940]  Are you trying to light it on fire?
[58:40.560 --> 58:43.900]  Yeah, I was trying to maybe use it as like...
[58:43.900 --> 58:44.260]  Oh, yeah.
[58:44.340 --> 58:45.580]  I couldn't figure that out.
[58:45.640 --> 58:47.940]  Put a corner on this bit here.
[58:48.820 --> 58:49.820]  Is this how this was?
[58:50.900 --> 58:52.300]  There was nothing there before.
[58:52.320 --> 58:52.660]  What do they call it?
[58:52.660 --> 58:53.860]  The Olympics.
[58:54.100 --> 58:55.680]  They run and then they...
[58:55.680 --> 58:58.320]  Try to pole vault the wall, maybe?
[58:59.200 --> 58:59.600]  Alright.
[59:00.080 --> 59:02.800]  We'll just go ahead and pop this bad boy in.
[59:27.180 --> 59:28.660]  I can't get this pipe.
[59:29.300 --> 59:29.700]  Eric.
[59:30.960 --> 59:32.140]  I tried to pole vault.
[59:32.760 --> 59:34.780]  Yeah, and there's not much
[59:34.780 --> 59:35.740]  left of your pole there, bud.
[59:38.140 --> 59:38.680]  Did you
[59:38.680 --> 59:40.120]  just need to close it off with a couple of
[59:40.920 --> 59:41.320]  corners?
[59:41.520 --> 59:43.320]  I guess so.
[59:44.000 --> 59:45.260]  So you can just block this one?
[59:46.920 --> 59:47.120]  Yeah.
[59:48.020 --> 59:49.820]  Because we still need a straight in there.
[59:50.080 --> 59:52.120]  I see what you're saying.
[59:52.200 --> 59:52.920]  You're closing the loop.
[59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.340]  Alright.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:01.680]  Okay.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.460]  There we are.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.860]  All for Gavin.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:06.880]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.160]  We did it!
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.460]  Nice, boys.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.460]  More pipes. That's fun.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.360]  Look at me. Guys.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.620]  I've almost made it.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.000]  Look at me. Come back.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:20.340]  Come back.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.600]  He's actually doing it.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.620]  Way to go, dude.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.900]  You got it.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.920]  Oh, there you are.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.160]  Did you just roly-poly on the wall?
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.600]  I've been roly-polying this whole time.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.720]  Hey, can I hand this blue pipe
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.160]  to somebody?
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:41.920]  Yep, here I come.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.340]  I can see you.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.460]  Gavin, we can break the window with this.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.400]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.460]  Pull it that way a little, and then we'll roll it.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:53.900]  Come on.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.020]  Jump up.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.540]  Andrew, we're going to set you free with this barrel.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.480]  Yeah, we're going to help you.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:00:59.600]  We got you.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.400]  Come on, Gavin.
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.000]  Alright, is that rollable now?
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.620]  Hang on to it.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:08.520]  Watch out!
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.160]  Oh, shit!
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:10.980]  Yes!
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.300]  You're free!
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:17.840]  Alright, so what do we do
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.500]  with this big plank?
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.740]  We take it.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.640]  And then we drop it
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.340]  over...
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:25.820]  that way?
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.820]  You got your hand in my mouth.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.220]  Sorry.
[01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:32.930]  What do you think?
[01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:35.790]  That's a problem.
[01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:37.530]  Oh, shit!
[01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:39.950]  I'm going to...
[01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:42.030]  What?
[01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:43.170]  Oh, my God!
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.080]  Let me clean up this mess
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:50.820]  for you.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.720]  I'm falling again! Look out, Geoff!
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.200]  Here we come, Geoff!
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.480]  Swanton Bomb!
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.040]  Oh!
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.780]  He did it. Alright, cool.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.000]  Alright, that did something for us.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.060]  Let's stop pissing around.
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.580]  Hey, what's up, Andrew?
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.540]  What's going on over here?
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.800]  Careful, don't cut your foot.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.060]  What did that do?
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.440]  We got workman's comp.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.480]  That's something we need to talk
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.740]  to the CPAs about.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.700]  Oh, we got to get up there and swing this thing around.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.440]  Okay, there's a control
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:24.960]  for the crane.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.900]  It's a cranier.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:28.820]  Oh!
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.100]  What happened?
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.280]  Eric was going up the ramp and it fell out from underneath him.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.740]  How do we get it up that high?
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.220]  We have to use a barrel?
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:43.600]  Oh, maybe.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.140]  Because I don't think we can lift it.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:46.800]  Yeah, let's get the barrel.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:49.400]  What was in that other door we opened up
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.280]  before we closed it?
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.160]  That was the way that
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.560]  we came from.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.280]  Let's get this glass out of here.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.340]  Clean up, crew!
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.460]  Oh, grab the ground.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.720]  Oh, grab nothing.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.400]  I feel like I'm pretty good at rolling the barrel now.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:11.340]  Sweet.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.900]  You should be in the Hobbit movie.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.240]  Who's on the other side? Andrew, what are you doing?
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.680]  Just seeing if I can break the other window.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.440]  Should we use
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.760]  this as a ramp to get up to the crane?
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.460]  Yeah, we need it to go
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.280]  up to the top here.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.480]  That's where it was though. Did we just pull it down?
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.580]  Oh, it was up there?
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.400]  I don't know. Let's see where it spawns.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.740]  Yeah, so if we just slide it down a bit, can we walk up it?
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:45.560]  Or put a barrel under it and
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.280]  climb up it?
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.580]  Might not even need to put a barrel under it.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.620]  We can just climb it.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.040]  We're really testing its weight limit.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.440]  I just...
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.900]  I don't think this is where... Is this where we're supposed to go?
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.460]  We need to swing the crane, I think,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.480]  to get to that other platform.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.260]  Yeah, let's find out.
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:07.180]  I'm on ze crane.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.780]  Alright, I'm on the thing.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.320]  We're swinging.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.200]  Nice, Nick.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.380]  Wow.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.020]  Wow.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.320]  There we go.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.060]  We'll use that to cross and we'll be set.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.140]  Crossing...
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:26.700]  Why?
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.640]  Oh no!
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.080]  It's a real cliffhanger situation.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.220]  Anyone need a hat?
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:36.940]  Eric does.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:37.980]  I'll pull you up.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:41.700]  Come on, Eric. We can do it.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.840]  Geoff, if we swing the crane,
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.760]  we can get him to the lower platform.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.480]  Let's do it.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.520]  Oh, it's coming around.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.360]  Spin it.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.040]  Alright, and...
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.320]  Alright.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.080]  This will take about 10 minutes.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.520]  Eric, are you swinging?
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.680]  Yeah, I'm swinging.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.180]  Yeah, man, I'm swinging.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.700]  Yeah, I'm swinging.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.480]  How's that going over there, Gav?
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.900]  I'm trying to get back up on this.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.920]  Well, Nick, let me go.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.380]  Hold on, I'll pull you up.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.020]  I'm going to climb up and I'm going to pull Geoff.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:33.480]  Oh, that's perfect.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.200]  I'm still holding on to you. Maybe I can swing you.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.360]  Okay.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:39.900]  Yeah, man, I'm swinging.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.480]  We can swing you to the ledge.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.620]  We can get that ledge.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.240]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:52.440]  Alright.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:54.760]  Alright.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:55.960]  Alright.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.700]  I'm going to need some help from you.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.080]  Alright, Nick.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.860]  I'll get him, Nick. Hold the barrel.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.000]  Okay, I'll hold the barrel. Hold it steady.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.220]  I am not letting go.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:06.640]  Yeah, I know.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.400]  Alright, keep holding, guys. Now stop there.
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.260]  Okay, it stopped.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.980]  Okay, I'll climb up.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.860]  I got it.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.500]  Damn it, let go of the freaking bottom.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.660]  Does anybody remember Andrew?
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.800]  I'm doing the pipes.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.180]  Yeah, Andrew's busy.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.200]  I'm doing the pipes.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.400]  He's not part of the rescue mission.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.340]  Alright, go, Gavin. I'll follow.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.420]  I'm here. I'm piping.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.480]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.060]  That's...
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:37.140]  Okay, now, Nick. Roll the barrel into me.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.020]  Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. Here we go.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.700]  Here we go. Alright, it's coming up.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.100]  This is going to work.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.340]  Okay, roll it into my back.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.480]  Roll it into my spine.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.940]  Right into your spine.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.280]  And then I'll swing them around.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.680]  Oh, hold on. Let me get out of the way.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.460]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, we're losing it.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.740]  Okay, I caught it. We're alright.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:57.420]  Okay.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:58.960]  Okay, ready?
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.860]  Right in your back. Here we go.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.620]  Yeah, this is great.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.020]  You just sit on top of it.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.340]  You almost got it there.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.840]  Okay, I'm going to go low down.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.220]  Alright, push.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.400]  Okay, go ahead and push.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.900]  Yeah, go ahead and push.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.160]  And here we go.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:20.540]  There you go.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:22.800]  Good push.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.760]  Alright, Nick, grab my legs and just run it.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.100]  There it goes.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.800]  The barrel right off the edge.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:28.280]  Alright, come on.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.060]  Are we going the other way?
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.180]  We got it.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.180]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:36.860]  Pull me.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.220]  Geoff, they got it.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.220]  This is going to work.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.600]  Nick, run me that way.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.040]  Yeah, pull.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.560]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.580]  What the hell was that thing?
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.700]  Holy shit.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.060]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.280]  Alright, Nick, swing me back the other way.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.280]  So run me backwards.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.000]  And now full sprint.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:07:59.780]  Alright, here we go.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.560]  Alright, and we're there.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:06.580]  And...
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:09.300]  Alright, now Eric, you just jump off onto the bar.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.920]  Alright, here we go.
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:12.660]  Here I go.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.160]  Big jump.
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.480]  Okay, big jump.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.000]  Here I go.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:18.880]  Alright, here we go.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:19.920]  Big jump.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.640]  Andrew, pull.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.080]  I got you.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.340]  Alright, Eric, big jump.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:29.800]  Okay, big jump.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:30.540]  Here I go.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.120]  Which left?
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.680]  There you go, big jump.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:38.400]  Big jump.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.040]  Alright, big jump.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:42.660]  I'm pulling.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.120]  And three, two...
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.280]  No, no, no, do it, swing it.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.480]  Swing it right, all the way right.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.000]  Eric, swing it all the way right.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.780]  And then rip it left.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:53.400]  Now!
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.220]  Here we go! Let it fly!
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.460]  Swing us around hard.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.720]  Yep, here we go.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.160]  Big jump.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.280]  Big jump.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.560]  Big jump.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.680]  Hey, look, we made it.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.060]  Wow.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.180]  Oh, what a harrowing journey.
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.500]  Someone's made a mess over it.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.180]  Yeah, it's, uh...
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.000]  Well, boys...
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.220]  Hey, Eric, did you get to answer some emails during that, or what?
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.500]  It's been a long day, absolutely.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.380]  I was doing some slacks,
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.360]  I was answering some emails,
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.360]  and boys, we did it!
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.540]  A long day of construction has come to an end,
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.580]  and Human Fall Flat has come to an end as well.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.840]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.620]  Don't forget to check out the podcast, Regulation Pod.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.160]  You can check out our Patreon
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.640]  at patreon.com slash theregulationpod.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.860]  Why would you drown me, Nick?
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.520]  You can see every other gameplay video,
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:46.160]  every other version of Human Fall Flat
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.800]  that we've played. Check it out.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.260]  It goes about as well as this.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.480]  This is probably better than it usually goes.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.120]  Let us know if you forged the key.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:56.360]  Yeah, let us know if you forged the key.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.980]  Honestly, just go and leave a comment.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.940]  If you forged the key,
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.240]  just leave a comment that says,
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.060]  yes, I forged the key.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.280]  And then that's it.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.100]  Whereas we did it hardcore mode.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.760]  So let us know if you forged the key.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.220]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.380]  Bye!
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:14.980]  Ding ding ding. Bye bye.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:15.780]  Oh my god!
