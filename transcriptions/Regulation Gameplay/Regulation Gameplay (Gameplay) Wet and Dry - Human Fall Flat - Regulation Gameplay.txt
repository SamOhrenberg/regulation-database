[00:00.000 --> 00:02.220]  Welcome to Human Fall Flat. We're doing it again.
[00:02.580 --> 00:03.680]  I'm here for the first time.
[00:05.020 --> 00:06.520]  Andrew's here for the first time. We're both...
[00:06.520 --> 00:07.780]  I assume we're both luchadors.
[00:07.980 --> 00:08.560]  It won't let me move.
[00:10.120 --> 00:11.260]  It won't let me move.
[00:12.580 --> 00:13.360]  Andrew's over here.
[00:13.400 --> 00:14.640]  Here, we'll help.
[00:16.000 --> 00:16.860]  Yeah, we gotcha.
[00:18.480 --> 00:20.140]  I picked him up by the arm.
[00:20.520 --> 00:21.820]  Now there's only going to be me taking him.
[00:23.680 --> 00:24.580]  Andrew, come with us.
[00:25.720 --> 00:26.400]  Come on, Andrew.
[00:27.700 --> 00:28.520]  Thanks, guys.
[00:28.520 --> 00:29.400]  Yep.
[00:30.240 --> 00:31.300]  Into the boat!
[00:32.680 --> 00:33.800]  I'm out of the boat!
[00:34.500 --> 00:35.900]  I'm drowning, guys!
[00:36.900 --> 00:37.540]  I'm drowning!
[00:48.900 --> 00:51.180]  If they're across,
[00:51.340 --> 00:52.120]  then we can be able...
[00:52.120 --> 00:53.140]  Can you really not move, Andrew?
[00:53.140 --> 00:56.980]  I can't move. I'm stuck.
[00:57.780 --> 00:59.360]  Maybe your body loaded in,
[00:59.460 --> 01:01.520]  but your brain is in the lobby.
[01:01.960 --> 01:02.400]  Yeah.
[01:02.800 --> 01:05.740]  I can pause the game and I can move the camera around,
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.420]  but I physically can't move my character.
[01:07.780 --> 01:08.900]  Have you tried the stick?
[01:09.340 --> 01:09.620]  Yep.
[01:10.600 --> 01:13.280]  Does it look like I'm desperate for Andrew to play this game?
[01:14.400 --> 01:15.920]  I'm trying to turn the boat around
[01:15.920 --> 01:17.220]  so we can come pick you guys up.
[01:19.320 --> 01:20.900]  Who's in the yellow suit?
[01:21.460 --> 01:21.600]  Me.
[01:21.840 --> 01:22.820]  You're not helping.
[01:24.240 --> 01:25.200]  Thank you.
[01:26.220 --> 01:27.340]  What do you want from me?
[01:27.580 --> 01:28.700]  I wanted to tell a story.
[01:29.040 --> 01:30.120]  Maybe that'll help.
[01:30.860 --> 01:33.100]  Yeah, I was gonna go get the speed boat.
[01:33.220 --> 01:34.300]  Oh, my arm is free.
[01:35.360 --> 01:36.720]  Does that mean you can move?
[01:36.820 --> 01:37.060]  No.
[01:38.280 --> 01:39.680]  Maybe I'll leave and rejoin.
[01:40.480 --> 01:41.580]  I'm drowning this guy.
[01:41.900 --> 01:44.440]  Hey, we're coming back with a sailboat.
[01:44.940 --> 01:45.440]  Sounds good.
[01:45.860 --> 01:47.880]  Gavin's not super excited about it.
[01:48.340 --> 01:50.840]  Me and Andrew are over here with our regular boat.
[01:51.880 --> 01:52.280]  Sailing.
[01:53.080 --> 01:54.100]  Take me away.
[01:55.100 --> 01:56.540]  Are we trying to get to the chef, Geoff?
[01:58.580 --> 02:00.020]  Didn't he write that about Lake Travis?
[02:01.220 --> 02:01.940]  No way.
[02:02.360 --> 02:02.600]  Really?
[02:02.980 --> 02:03.400]  I think so.
[02:03.500 --> 02:05.880]  Yeah, he recorded the album in Austin.
[02:06.040 --> 02:06.200]  Really?
[02:06.440 --> 02:10.460]  That is not where the round rock is.
[02:10.640 --> 02:12.340]  It's like a Mike Pyrtle fun fact.
[02:12.680 --> 02:13.800]  Oh, wow, that's so cool.
[02:15.100 --> 02:15.720]  I'm here.
[02:16.060 --> 02:17.140]  Oh, can I play now?
[02:17.140 --> 02:18.440]  I think I can move.
[02:18.700 --> 02:20.460]  I see him slugging around.
[02:20.660 --> 02:22.240]  Come on, slug boy.
[02:23.140 --> 02:24.820]  Oh, they're over there.
[02:25.420 --> 02:26.020]  Jump in.
[02:26.760 --> 02:28.500]  You gotta get me in the water.
[02:29.240 --> 02:30.440]  Let's turn this bitch around.
[02:30.900 --> 02:31.240]  Here we go.
[02:32.860 --> 02:35.200]  Here we go.
[02:35.680 --> 02:35.800]  Okay.
[02:37.680 --> 02:38.120]  And here we go.
[02:38.540 --> 02:38.760]  Paddle.
[02:40.160 --> 02:42.940]  I'm doing it.
[02:43.260 --> 02:44.260]  You got this.
[02:44.260 --> 02:46.620]  Yep, here it comes.
[02:46.860 --> 02:47.180]  We're coming.
[02:48.340 --> 02:49.680]  Oh no, Gavin.
[02:51.160 --> 02:52.340]  Oh, that's backwards, hang on.
[02:53.020 --> 02:53.860]  He drowned.
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.120]  Um, uh oh.
[02:57.340 --> 02:58.400]  Uh oh, I let go of the oars.
[02:58.620 --> 02:59.000]  Geoff, why are you here?
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.120]  I let go of the oars, hang on.
[03:00.500 --> 03:03.160]  My grip is getting a little loose.
[03:03.460 --> 03:05.180]  He drowned.
[03:06.060 --> 03:07.780]  Well, the raft got stuck, didn't it?
[03:08.120 --> 03:08.840]  Yeah, a little bit.
[03:09.760 --> 03:11.100]  Can't we just use the wind?
[03:12.680 --> 03:14.320]  Oh, I lost a hand.
[03:15.000 --> 03:15.620]  Uh oh.
[03:15.840 --> 03:16.380]  Oh no.
[03:18.220 --> 03:19.160]  Give me the oar.
[03:20.380 --> 03:21.160]  Where's the oar?
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.760]  Goodbye, my friends.
[03:23.220 --> 03:24.580]  I'm off to the ferris wheel.
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.180]  Uh oh.
[03:27.400 --> 03:29.380]  Guys, this might not have worked out for Ole Eric.
[03:30.540 --> 03:32.180]  Hey, this piece of shit.
[03:32.760 --> 03:33.540]  Hey, what's up?
[03:33.960 --> 03:34.480]  What's going on?
[03:34.540 --> 03:35.400]  Oh, Andrew, what's up?
[03:37.920 --> 03:39.180]  Gavin and I are embracing.
[03:39.660 --> 03:40.840]  I've lifted up a pirate.
[03:41.800 --> 03:43.060]  I love you guys.
[03:44.180 --> 03:46.120]  Wait, I don't know if I can get back over there.
[03:46.160 --> 03:46.940]  I don't know how to do it.
[03:47.040 --> 03:48.800]  Wait until we're finished, we've got something going on over here.
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.120]  You don't want to see it.
[03:51.380 --> 03:52.100]  Look away.
[03:52.600 --> 03:54.300]  Guys, this is like my dream last night.
[03:56.440 --> 03:57.440]  Is there a phoenix there?
[03:57.620 --> 03:57.780]  No!
[03:59.440 --> 04:00.160]  Was there ever.
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.080]  Get the speedboat, Eric.
[04:03.400 --> 04:04.620]  I'm trying to get anything.
[04:05.340 --> 04:06.060]  Aquatic thrust!
[04:06.060 --> 04:07.080]  Aquatic thrust!
[04:08.540 --> 04:09.620]  Am I getting closer?
[04:10.640 --> 04:11.680]  Eric, can you...
[04:12.290 --> 04:13.860]  Why did you grab both oars and row?
[04:14.400 --> 04:16.520]  I tried. It wasn't giving me a good row.
[04:17.880 --> 04:18.560]  Get off me.
[04:19.320 --> 04:20.880]  You one-legged son of a bitch.
[04:21.220 --> 04:21.780]  Get off me.
[04:23.320 --> 04:25.040]  You won't let go of my neck, guys.
[04:25.340 --> 04:26.180]  I can't do it.
[04:26.640 --> 04:27.960]  I want to, but I can't.
[04:28.420 --> 04:29.500]  You won't let go of my neck.
[04:30.360 --> 04:32.040]  Eric's got a bad row over there.
[04:32.680 --> 04:34.480]  The row is so bad over here.
[04:34.480 --> 04:36.900]  We'll go back into the sea. We're going to reset.
[04:37.160 --> 04:38.160]  We're resetting this.
[04:38.680 --> 04:40.480]  Eric, you look like an idiot. What are you doing?
[04:40.920 --> 04:42.600]  I'm trying to grab both oars!
[04:43.800 --> 04:44.520]  There we go.
[04:44.980 --> 04:45.700]  Here we go.
[04:46.980 --> 04:47.060]  Ah!
[04:48.960 --> 04:49.400]  Shit!
[04:50.360 --> 04:50.960]  Hang on.
[04:53.220 --> 04:54.360]  I'm laying down.
[04:55.380 --> 04:56.220]  Here it comes.
[04:56.920 --> 04:57.860]  Okay, over this way.
[04:58.600 --> 04:59.820]  Oh, fuck.
[05:01.520 --> 05:02.520]  We're coming to you.
[05:03.100 --> 05:03.760]  Not again!
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.020]  Oh, here we go.
[05:05.860 --> 05:06.300]  Jump!
[05:07.960 --> 05:09.860]  Okay, here I come.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.160]  You ready to see some cool shit, fellas?
[05:11.520 --> 05:12.700]  Here we go!
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.580]  Nick missed. He drowned.
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.380]  Jump on, boys.
[05:19.000 --> 05:19.580]  Come on, fellas.
[05:20.900 --> 05:21.500]  Come on, guys.
[05:21.680 --> 05:23.140]  Why did you go so far away?
[05:23.880 --> 05:25.300]  100% Nick's fault.
[05:25.420 --> 05:26.360]  What were you talking about?
[05:26.840 --> 05:28.580]  Nick's hanging on and moving us backwards.
[05:29.200 --> 05:30.000]  Over here!
[05:30.680 --> 05:32.220]  Yeah, I'm trying. Nick killed us.
[05:32.940 --> 05:34.840]  I got a new word, Luna Nick.
[05:38.680 --> 05:41.500]  We are making the move towards you guys.
[05:41.620 --> 05:42.240]  Here we come.
[05:42.420 --> 05:42.940]  I'm strafing.
[05:43.720 --> 05:44.900]  I look like Mr. Krabs.
[05:46.920 --> 05:48.500]  You think any of this makes it in the video?
[05:48.780 --> 05:48.900]  Yeah.
[05:50.220 --> 05:50.820]  That's okay.
[05:51.780 --> 05:54.600]  Here, Gavin. Jump on. I want you to row.
[05:55.400 --> 05:55.740]  Okay.
[05:56.260 --> 05:57.400]  There's a chef on me.
[05:57.980 --> 05:58.340]  Okay.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.460]  I got myself.
[06:01.800 --> 06:02.840]  Come on in, guys.
[06:04.060 --> 06:04.780]  I'm drowning.
[06:05.980 --> 06:06.220]  What?
[06:07.400 --> 06:08.800]  Gavin, we're leaving.
[06:09.520 --> 06:10.320]  How do you get up?
[06:11.760 --> 06:14.260]  I'm getting a speedboat. I'm sick of Gavin.
[06:14.700 --> 06:16.740]  Gavin had a lot to say and then the boat was near him.
[06:16.840 --> 06:18.020]  And then he's like, I don't want to get in the boat.
[06:18.140 --> 06:18.940]  I'm right here. Turn around.
[06:20.760 --> 06:21.460]  Goodbye, Gavin.
[06:22.440 --> 06:23.920]  Oh, why did I die?
[06:23.920 --> 06:27.080]  Is Gavin's chef hat just popping up and down to the side?
[06:27.360 --> 06:27.960]  I'm the chef.
[06:29.040 --> 06:29.500]  I'm the chef.
[06:29.980 --> 06:30.640]  That's Nick.
[06:31.600 --> 06:33.520]  I got stuck down.
[06:34.100 --> 06:36.140]  Maybe when you get to the speedboat, we'll...
[06:36.740 --> 06:37.880]  We'll spawn over there.
[06:38.220 --> 06:39.220]  You should be able to.
[06:39.600 --> 06:40.620]  Let's find out.
[06:41.040 --> 06:41.740]  Give it a shot.
[06:43.600 --> 06:45.180]  Now what do we do?
[06:47.160 --> 06:48.000]  Move the boat?
[06:49.860 --> 06:52.320]  Do we need to use these things to move them?
[06:52.320 --> 06:54.260]  I can't get up again. What's wrong with my legs?
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.940]  Probably the logs.
[06:56.240 --> 06:57.660]  Why can't I not get up?
[06:58.340 --> 06:59.400]  That happened to me on the beach.
[06:59.780 --> 07:01.080]  I can move my arms.
[07:03.060 --> 07:04.040]  Jumps do something?
[07:04.380 --> 07:05.160]  Yeah, jumps get you up.
[07:06.420 --> 07:07.040]  Alright, let's go.
[07:07.580 --> 07:09.520]  Gavin just punched the air laying down.
[07:09.920 --> 07:13.140]  You're like a UFC fighter that got knocked out with your arms straight in front of you.
[07:13.140 --> 07:14.880]  Lean the boat the other way. Lean the boat.
[07:15.300 --> 07:16.520]  Severe head injury arms.
[07:16.940 --> 07:18.440]  Gavin, get off that side of the boat.
[07:19.060 --> 07:19.580]  Oh, sorry.
[07:19.580 --> 07:20.460]  We're doing good.
[07:22.740 --> 07:23.400]  It's me.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.860]  Get the stick in there.
[07:26.260 --> 07:27.100]  Jam it home.
[07:27.420 --> 07:30.240]  We're tilting the boat.
[07:31.200 --> 07:31.400]  Until...
[07:31.920 --> 07:32.580]  There you go.
[07:34.140 --> 07:35.560]  We're almost at the water.
[07:36.500 --> 07:37.100]  This is great.
[07:37.720 --> 07:39.360]  Can I grab the propeller?
[07:39.660 --> 07:40.100]  Push.
[07:43.400 --> 07:43.460]  Push.
[07:47.580 --> 07:49.120]  It's blending your feet up.
[07:49.600 --> 07:50.560]  Alright, here we go.
[07:50.820 --> 07:51.140]  Push.
[07:52.200 --> 07:52.920]  Push the boat.
[07:54.960 --> 07:55.940]  Gavin, you're not pushing the boat.
[07:56.160 --> 07:58.780]  This would make a perfect postcard right here.
[08:00.220 --> 08:01.540]  Get my head back around.
[08:03.060 --> 08:04.780]  Who's the other luchador in the front?
[08:04.880 --> 08:05.920]  Is that Geoff?
[08:05.920 --> 08:06.380]  That's the captain.
[08:07.780 --> 08:11.840]  I'd like to take a fucking awesome photo for us.
[08:12.160 --> 08:13.420]  Alright, we in?
[08:14.160 --> 08:14.460]  Hang on.
[08:14.580 --> 08:15.400]  We're not in the water yet.
[08:15.560 --> 08:17.220]  I'll keep pushing the boat.
[08:17.220 --> 08:19.260]  You guys are doing great.
[08:19.460 --> 08:20.300]  Just hop on in.
[08:20.880 --> 08:23.480]  Alright, Andrew made it.
[08:24.520 --> 08:25.880]  Eric didn't quite make it.
[08:25.940 --> 08:26.240]  It's okay.
[08:27.480 --> 08:28.320]  I'm here, fellas!
[08:29.620 --> 08:30.200]  Where's Eric?
[08:31.160 --> 08:33.200]  I'm back on the beach. It's okay.
[08:34.420 --> 08:35.140]  Here I come, guys.
[08:35.280 --> 08:36.040]  I'm over here.
[08:37.660 --> 08:38.440]  Go, go, go!
[08:41.660 --> 08:43.160]  Where are we going?
[08:43.160 --> 08:44.140]  Let's go.
[08:44.140 --> 08:44.900]  Where are we going?
[08:45.980 --> 08:46.840]  Get on, son.
[08:49.680 --> 08:50.520]  Who's driving?
[08:50.760 --> 08:52.180]  Why are you going into the...
[08:52.180 --> 08:52.960]  We're fine.
[08:54.220 --> 08:55.620]  That means he's driving.
[08:58.420 --> 08:59.620]  Andrew, if I've ever seen it.
[08:59.900 --> 09:01.080]  Tilt the boat to the right.
[09:01.180 --> 09:02.580]  Everyone on the right side of the boat.
[09:02.720 --> 09:03.160]  Lean.
[09:04.800 --> 09:05.800]  Andrew, you have to drive it.
[09:07.460 --> 09:08.760]  Alright, Andrew jumped off.
[09:08.880 --> 09:09.880]  I'm pushing it back in.
[09:10.580 --> 09:11.020]  Fellas.
[09:11.940 --> 09:13.040]  I'm the king of the world.
[09:13.180 --> 09:15.980]  He's exactly like this when he's captain in Sea of Thieves 2.
[09:16.300 --> 09:16.800]  Here we go.
[09:18.540 --> 09:19.980]  Hey, we're on the beach.
[09:20.660 --> 09:21.720]  I'm getting you off.
[09:21.880 --> 09:22.780]  Gavin, you want to drive it?
[09:24.200 --> 09:26.680]  Gavin, shut up. Andrew's getting you off.
[09:26.900 --> 09:27.040]  Enjoy.
[09:28.280 --> 09:29.820]  Sit back and enjoy the ride.
[09:30.260 --> 09:31.200]  He's a regular phoenix.
[09:32.560 --> 09:34.100]  Go, go!
[09:34.660 --> 09:35.100]  Grab it!
[09:36.560 --> 09:37.360]  I'll push.
[09:37.360 --> 09:38.680]  Go, go!
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.900]  I'll push the boat.
[09:42.060 --> 09:43.520]  Somebody grab the propeller.
[09:43.820 --> 09:44.720]  Yeah, get the propeller.
[09:45.620 --> 09:46.720]  I'm pushing the boat.
[09:48.020 --> 09:49.420]  Somebody get the propeller!
[09:50.320 --> 09:50.700]  Alright, go.
[09:50.980 --> 09:51.700]  We're off.
[09:52.700 --> 09:53.540]  Goodbye, Eric.
[09:54.360 --> 09:55.780]  I'm still here. I'm hanging on.
[09:55.980 --> 09:56.700]  Who didn't come?
[09:57.620 --> 10:00.660]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[10:01.500 --> 10:02.720]  I fell off.
[10:03.660 --> 10:05.220]  Let's just get to the next checkpoint.
[10:05.220 --> 10:06.800]  You should be able to spawn there, right?
[10:07.000 --> 10:07.920]  In the middle of the beach?
[10:08.780 --> 10:10.740]  I was trying to pull from the front.
[10:11.640 --> 10:12.360]  Are you?
[10:13.660 --> 10:14.300]  It's me.
[10:14.980 --> 10:15.400]  It's me.
[10:16.720 --> 10:17.680]  It's me.
[10:19.420 --> 10:20.540]  Now we're good.
[10:20.880 --> 10:23.380]  Should we see what this place is about?
[10:23.660 --> 10:24.360]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[10:26.220 --> 10:26.700]  Upgrade.
[10:27.340 --> 10:27.920]  Here we go.
[10:28.920 --> 10:29.660]  Be careful!
[10:31.480 --> 10:32.900]  To the sea!
[10:33.480 --> 10:34.200]  Uh-oh.
[10:35.520 --> 10:37.400]  Careful, you'll go right down to the bottom of the ocean.
[10:37.520 --> 10:38.680]  Uh-oh!
[10:39.320 --> 10:40.420]  I'm back in the water!
[10:44.260 --> 10:45.940]  No, I'm back in the water!
[10:46.460 --> 10:46.920]  No, Nick!
[10:48.140 --> 10:49.140]  No, Nick.
[10:49.780 --> 10:50.180]  November.
[10:55.220 --> 10:56.660]  I'm barely holding on.
[10:58.420 --> 10:59.720]  I need help.
[11:01.180 --> 11:01.960]  Don't we all?
[11:02.120 --> 11:04.020]  The ocean's taking me.
[11:04.140 --> 11:04.540]  No, I'm back.
[11:05.580 --> 11:07.080]  Please, sir, I want to live.
[11:08.440 --> 11:10.620]  Isn't there a way to raise your hands over your head?
[11:10.940 --> 11:11.320]  Am I crazy?
[11:11.500 --> 11:12.240]  Yeah, you gotta look up.
[11:14.940 --> 11:15.380]  Yeah?
[11:17.500 --> 11:17.820]  Me too.
[11:25.920 --> 11:28.920]  Should we just put the boat where we can climb in?
[11:28.920 --> 11:30.200]  I'm taking down a platform!
[11:30.200 --> 11:31.860]  Fucking hell!
[11:32.860 --> 11:33.440]  Who's on me?
[11:33.500 --> 11:34.280]  I flipped it.
[11:34.980 --> 11:36.220]  I thought it would be kinda cool.
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.580]  Oh, shit!
[11:39.480 --> 11:40.040]  Ouch!
[11:40.340 --> 11:41.960]  Oh, I banged my face.
[11:42.920 --> 11:43.200]  Nice.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.040]  No, off the side again!
[11:48.520 --> 11:50.120]  Off the side again!
[11:51.060 --> 11:52.700]  Alright, let's put the boat back.
[11:52.740 --> 11:53.580]  No, you'll kill us!
[11:54.160 --> 11:55.240]  Off the side again!
[11:55.900 --> 11:56.280]  Uh-oh.
[11:56.280 --> 11:56.920]  Oh!
[11:58.640 --> 11:59.460]  There we go.
[12:00.520 --> 12:01.920]  Take us to the back of the boat!
[12:02.600 --> 12:03.060]  Back of the boat.
[12:05.580 --> 12:06.220]  There we go.
[12:06.560 --> 12:07.340]  Nice job, Gavin.
[12:08.680 --> 12:09.880]  Take me with you.
[12:10.580 --> 12:11.740]  I'm gonna try to throw you across.
[12:12.860 --> 12:14.160]  It didn't happen.
[12:15.480 --> 12:17.140]  Back to the rock!
[12:17.360 --> 12:17.820]  We can make it!
[12:18.500 --> 12:20.520]  Can we drive this giant bad boy
[12:20.520 --> 12:21.820]  into the next area?
[12:22.080 --> 12:22.520]  Let's try.
[12:22.520 --> 12:23.540]  Go for the jump!
[12:24.240 --> 12:25.980]  I'll see you on the bridge, Gavin.
[12:26.820 --> 12:28.000]  Is there a run?
[12:28.040 --> 12:28.720]  Oh, there is.
[12:30.100 --> 12:32.900]  You just have to look up.
[12:33.840 --> 12:35.260]  Do you think this thing just loves us?
[12:36.280 --> 12:36.760]  Oh, nice.
[12:37.740 --> 12:38.000]  Uh-oh.
[12:38.480 --> 12:39.620]  I'll get one, you get the other.
[12:40.160 --> 12:41.700]  Oh, no. Oh, I missed.
[12:42.560 --> 12:43.420]  I'm so close.
[12:43.840 --> 12:45.420]  Oh, we're going backwards.
[12:47.140 --> 12:47.940]  Oh, guys.
[12:48.980 --> 12:49.480]  Oh, no.
[12:50.280 --> 12:51.620]  Full speed ahead.
[12:52.720 --> 12:52.820]  Guys.
[12:53.480 --> 12:54.040]  Yeah, what's up?
[12:55.020 --> 12:56.660]  I can't land on the rock.
[12:57.080 --> 12:58.800]  It keeps tossing me off the rock.
[13:00.400 --> 13:01.280]  Please stop.
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.060]  Where should we land?
[13:02.520 --> 13:04.160]  Pull back right, Gavin.
[13:04.240 --> 13:05.240]  I think we need to go by the lighthouse.
[13:07.200 --> 13:09.560]  They're gonna go advance.
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.140]  Oh, no.
[13:11.080 --> 13:12.080]  Are you guys on this giant boat?
[13:14.520 --> 13:15.720]  Yeah, we're on the boat.
[13:15.980 --> 13:16.680]  Keep going.
[13:16.680 --> 13:17.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[13:18.660 --> 13:19.860]  Does it look cool?
[13:20.740 --> 13:22.140]  It looks really cool, dude.
[13:22.180 --> 13:24.220]  How are you doing that?
[13:24.860 --> 13:27.340]  From on the boat, dude, it looks so good.
[13:27.420 --> 13:28.980]  I don't know what it looks like from a distance or anything.
[13:29.340 --> 13:32.140]  Dude, I'm on the bow and Geoff is on the stern.
[13:32.420 --> 13:33.220]  Yeah, I'm a stern man.
[13:33.460 --> 13:36.340]  So both the camera angles look really good.
[13:36.840 --> 13:37.280]  Nick, left.
[13:37.700 --> 13:38.100]  Nick, left.
[13:38.480 --> 13:39.080]  Nick, left.
[13:41.620 --> 13:42.380]  Nick, where'd you go?
[13:42.400 --> 13:42.900]  A hard left?
[13:45.520 --> 13:46.840]  What do you think now?
[13:47.600 --> 13:49.080]  Yeah, get it in there.
[13:50.260 --> 13:51.180]  Uh-oh.
[13:52.020 --> 13:52.660]  Nick, left.
[13:52.880 --> 13:54.260]  I mean, forwards.
[13:55.840 --> 13:56.540]  Nick, left forward.
[13:56.960 --> 13:59.340]  Which one's left, starboard or port?
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.400]  Oh, it's port.
[14:01.720 --> 14:02.520]  Port's a pretty good wine.
[14:03.720 --> 14:04.140]  Is it?
[14:04.620 --> 14:05.840]  I don't think I've ever had a port.
[14:06.560 --> 14:07.400]  Port is great.
[14:07.540 --> 14:08.780]  It's delicious. Very sweet.
[14:09.380 --> 14:10.160]  Nice with a cigar.
[14:10.160 --> 14:13.480]  Have you ever seen that port wine cheese?
[14:14.880 --> 14:16.620]  Yeah, it's got like the red outside.
[14:16.720 --> 14:18.620]  I can't get up and I keep drowning.
[14:18.880 --> 14:19.580]  And I'm in hell.
[14:19.900 --> 14:20.980]  I'm in hell.
[14:21.220 --> 14:21.540]  No!
[14:23.080 --> 14:24.760]  Oh, is this an aircraft carrier?
[14:25.740 --> 14:26.240]  Yes!
[14:26.920 --> 14:28.340]  Spawn me somewhere else!
[14:28.600 --> 14:28.920]  Yes!
[14:30.380 --> 14:30.880]  Let's go, Geoff.
[14:31.260 --> 14:32.980]  Oh, lads, look at this.
[14:34.280 --> 14:35.500]  You made it!
[14:35.660 --> 14:36.640]  Let's take the boat.
[14:36.640 --> 14:38.340]  Oh, yeah, we took the boat over here.
[14:38.560 --> 14:41.180]  What a journey we've all been on.
[14:41.260 --> 14:41.500]  Yes.
[14:42.600 --> 14:43.940]  I want the button.
[14:45.080 --> 14:46.240]  Somebody go hit that button.
[14:47.000 --> 14:47.380]  Which one?
[14:48.060 --> 14:49.920]  The one that someone's climbing up on.
[14:51.300 --> 14:52.620]  Use my head. Use my body.
[14:54.260 --> 14:54.900]  Thank you.
[14:54.960 --> 14:55.360]  There you go.
[14:56.360 --> 14:58.160]  Is it buttons or levers that I need?
[14:59.460 --> 15:00.180]  There's three.
[15:00.380 --> 15:01.640]  Let's get two people up here.
[15:02.860 --> 15:03.240]  Oh, shit.
[15:04.240 --> 15:05.580]  Try to help you, Geoff.
[15:05.680 --> 15:06.360]  You want to jump up?
[15:07.540 --> 15:09.900]  Yeah, let's lift up the blue crate.
[15:10.060 --> 15:10.580]  There you go, Geoff.
[15:11.820 --> 15:13.420]  How are you climbing, Nick?
[15:13.740 --> 15:14.400]  Are you able to get up?
[15:14.840 --> 15:16.280]  Can I help you?
[15:17.480 --> 15:19.840]  Jump, and then pull, look down.
[15:21.780 --> 15:23.640]  Alright, bring the...
[15:24.540 --> 15:25.640]  No, no, yeah, but...
[15:26.260 --> 15:27.480]  Bring it towards us, someone.
[15:27.720 --> 15:28.440]  Bring it towards us.
[15:29.160 --> 15:30.040]  What the fuck?
[15:30.040 --> 15:30.800]  Okay, never mind.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.200]  Where are you going?
[15:33.840 --> 15:34.560]  What the fuck?
[15:36.800 --> 15:37.960]  Pick up the blue one.
[15:39.060 --> 15:39.280]  Okay.
[15:41.500 --> 15:42.760]  We look like little toddlers.
[15:43.020 --> 15:43.560]  Go get the blue one.
[15:44.480 --> 15:45.680]  Do we just pick up the yellow one?
[15:45.800 --> 15:46.540]  I can't figure it out.
[15:46.760 --> 15:48.180]  You said go for the blue one.
[15:50.560 --> 15:52.840]  So someone needs to be in charge of hooking hooks on.
[15:54.000 --> 15:54.780]  That's Top Hat.
[15:55.740 --> 15:56.100]  Okay.
[15:57.740 --> 15:59.720]  Top Hat, you were the one in charge of the hooks.
[15:59.720 --> 16:00.720]  You were next to that.
[16:01.860 --> 16:03.680]  There you go. Luchador's got it.
[16:05.180 --> 16:06.240]  Did I do it?
[16:09.760 --> 16:11.620]  I think we need to...
[16:11.620 --> 16:12.040]  Hold on.
[16:12.840 --> 16:15.380]  Yeah, I think Andrew's just gonna try to do it.
[16:15.460 --> 16:17.680]  Because he's in single player mode right now.
[16:17.920 --> 16:19.340]  What do you mean? We're all trying to do it.
[16:20.180 --> 16:20.860]  Aren't we all trying to do it?
[16:21.260 --> 16:24.460]  I thought Andrew was trying to go all the way by himself.
[16:24.660 --> 16:25.780]  Geoff told me to put the hooks on.
[16:25.820 --> 16:26.740]  He said I'm doing hooks.
[16:26.740 --> 16:27.960]  Yeah, no, you're doing great.
[16:28.320 --> 16:29.220]  How'd you get over there?
[16:30.540 --> 16:32.480]  Do you gotta manually put the hooks on?
[16:33.780 --> 16:35.080]  Yeah, you told me to do it, didn't you?
[16:36.380 --> 16:38.220]  I thought you just drop it with the lever.
[16:38.820 --> 16:39.440]  Over here.
[16:39.800 --> 16:40.380]  What does this do?
[16:40.640 --> 16:42.220]  Oh, Andrew using...
[16:43.660 --> 16:43.980]  Yeah.
[16:45.720 --> 16:46.500]  I'm with you, Gavin.
[16:48.060 --> 16:48.820]  Let's get some of these.
[16:50.020 --> 16:50.780]  Gavin, help me up.
[16:52.860 --> 16:54.680]  Oh, we need...
[16:55.420 --> 16:56.820]  Gavin, you're by the stash.
[16:57.340 --> 16:58.960]  Oh, we need to adjust this platform.
[16:59.140 --> 17:00.060]  Yank my stash.
[17:01.120 --> 17:01.540]  Hold it.
[17:02.220 --> 17:02.880]  I let go.
[17:03.660 --> 17:05.600]  You need to bring it closer to you.
[17:06.020 --> 17:07.800]  How about that?
[17:08.060 --> 17:09.080]  Geoff, can you get more?
[17:11.100 --> 17:11.980]  Oh, shit.
[17:12.560 --> 17:13.280]  You did it.
[17:14.320 --> 17:15.400]  Alright, let's hook him up.
[17:15.820 --> 17:16.720]  More, or is it good?
[17:18.540 --> 17:21.780]  What if the hook team just holds the crate and then holds a hook?
[17:22.860 --> 17:23.600]  I'm getting...
[17:24.780 --> 17:26.060]  That's a pretty good...
[17:26.060 --> 17:26.720]  Oh, Andrew.
[17:27.580 --> 17:29.160]  Why is it moving away?
[17:30.340 --> 17:31.520]  It's pulling us.
[17:31.560 --> 17:32.720]  It's pulling us.
[17:32.880 --> 17:33.880]  It's pulling us.
[17:34.420 --> 17:37.060]  You gotta pull me up.
[17:37.840 --> 17:39.700]  Alright, I've got an arm on the crate
[17:39.700 --> 17:41.480]  and an arm on the hook. Lift.
[17:42.280 --> 17:42.760]  Lift.
[17:43.580 --> 17:46.060]  Wait, wait, wait. Let me do the same.
[17:47.380 --> 17:48.420]  Okay, I got it.
[17:48.580 --> 17:48.880]  That's it.
[17:49.240 --> 17:49.840]  Take us up.
[17:49.840 --> 17:52.400]  Oh, my God.
[17:52.480 --> 17:54.100]  Oh, my God.
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.340]  That's amazing.
[17:55.580 --> 17:56.540]  Where are you guys going?
[17:57.660 --> 18:00.640]  I'm like the rock in that shitty skyscraper movie.
[18:01.620 --> 18:03.040]  Now, where do you need to go from here?
[18:03.380 --> 18:04.960]  You gotta get up on that white walkway.
[18:05.300 --> 18:07.140]  Drive it. Drive it towards the walkway.
[18:07.160 --> 18:07.980]  Take us up.
[18:10.400 --> 18:12.300]  Oh, I'm looking around, Nick.
[18:13.240 --> 18:15.180]  I got the chains all knotted.
[18:15.660 --> 18:16.180]  Are you getting there?
[18:16.940 --> 18:19.460]  Someone's getting squished between the crates.
[18:20.860 --> 18:21.660]  All right, Andrew.
[18:22.100 --> 18:22.980]  Andrew, get on.
[18:24.080 --> 18:24.400]  Yes!
[18:25.760 --> 18:27.880]  All right, Eric, who's on the side of the blue?
[18:27.980 --> 18:28.420]  Let me try to help.
[18:28.600 --> 18:30.640]  I'm trying to climb up, but it won't let me.
[18:30.860 --> 18:31.460]  Oh, no.
[18:32.640 --> 18:35.600]  All right, I'm gonna, Eric, get under the blue thing.
[18:36.060 --> 18:36.460]  Okay.
[18:37.220 --> 18:37.720]  I got you.
[18:38.300 --> 18:38.700]  No!
[18:40.520 --> 18:42.280]  I let go with the wrong arm.
[18:42.720 --> 18:44.440]  I backbended stuck.
[18:46.760 --> 18:47.160]  Lift.
[18:50.100 --> 18:51.200]  Godspeed, boys.
[18:51.760 --> 18:52.300]  Godspeed.
[18:53.960 --> 18:56.280]  Oh, wow.
[18:56.440 --> 18:57.080]  Amazing, Nick.
[18:57.100 --> 18:57.740]  I did it.
[18:58.480 --> 18:59.680]  I'm stuck.
[19:01.080 --> 19:02.600]  Get on here, guys.
[19:02.920 --> 19:04.160]  Get on here.
[19:05.580 --> 19:06.700]  Andrew's leaving with us.
[19:07.040 --> 19:09.280]  Get on here. It's just going down the river.
[19:10.940 --> 19:11.740]  The river.
[19:14.020 --> 19:15.220]  I'm good.
[19:15.220 --> 19:16.800]  I'm good. I'll get my chops done.
[19:16.860 --> 19:18.380]  Oh, wow.
[19:18.620 --> 19:19.480]  I'm drowning.
[19:20.520 --> 19:22.860]  Oh, no.
[19:23.320 --> 19:24.460]  The box has left me.
[19:25.600 --> 19:26.040]  Okay.
[19:27.160 --> 19:28.680]  We just gotta go all the way.
[19:33.260 --> 19:35.400]  We're gonna get you guys a new box.
[19:35.760 --> 19:36.640]  Here's your box.
[19:36.980 --> 19:39.360]  Look down or up or whatever.
[19:39.420 --> 19:41.300]  We might need this box to climb, Andrew.
[19:41.580 --> 19:42.940]  Oh, shit. You think so?
[19:44.760 --> 19:46.100]  Yeah, it might be a climb box.
[19:46.180 --> 19:48.900]  Let me see if there's any other boxes back here.
[19:51.020 --> 19:52.240]  Doesn't look like it.
[19:54.140 --> 19:56.140]  Alright, I'm going to the box store. Hold on.
[19:56.860 --> 19:58.340]  We don't need to...
[19:58.340 --> 19:59.520]  We don't need the boxes over there.
[19:59.560 --> 20:00.180]  We can just climb.
[20:05.230 --> 20:05.950]  Show me.
[20:06.530 --> 20:06.990]  There we go.
[20:07.090 --> 20:08.430]  You're shagging the back of my head.
[20:09.010 --> 20:10.090]  How do you get over?
[20:10.610 --> 20:11.970]  I can't get up again. I'm dead.
[20:12.690 --> 20:14.950]  Let me try to pull you up.
[20:18.590 --> 20:19.750]  I can't get up.
[20:22.650 --> 20:25.410]  I don't know if this is where we're supposed to be, guys.
[20:25.690 --> 20:27.610]  I thought it was like a box store.
[20:28.490 --> 20:31.730]  There's nothing in here.
[20:32.550 --> 20:33.310]  Oh, I see.
[20:33.630 --> 20:35.150]  I think we're supposed to go over there.
[20:35.650 --> 20:38.330]  Oh, we do go there.
[20:39.170 --> 20:40.190]  Geoff, where'd you go?
[20:40.190 --> 20:41.030]  I'm back here.
[20:43.270 --> 20:44.130]  Oh, there you are.
[20:44.370 --> 20:46.310]  I'm joshing around, having fun.
[20:48.250 --> 20:50.930]  Oh, I think we have to keep going that way.
[20:51.070 --> 20:51.450]  I think so.
[20:53.290 --> 20:57.030]  I didn't make it.
[20:58.270 --> 20:59.570]  Yeah, it's been known to happen.
[21:01.990 --> 21:02.790]  There we go.
[21:06.010 --> 21:07.470]  We're really close.
[21:12.150 --> 21:13.530]  Andrew, grab this top box.
[21:13.650 --> 21:14.090]  Sorry.
[21:15.250 --> 21:15.690]  What?
[21:16.770 --> 21:17.730]  Oh, Andrew's gone.
[21:18.230 --> 21:18.650]  On my way.
[21:20.790 --> 21:22.690]  It's fine. Me and Geoff will do the boxes.
[21:23.650 --> 21:24.850]  We're built box tough.
[21:25.130 --> 21:25.450]  What's up, Nick?
[21:26.410 --> 21:26.790]  Need a hand?
[21:27.390 --> 21:28.390]  Putting it in the water?
[21:28.750 --> 21:31.150]  Yeah, because we're building a little...
[21:31.150 --> 21:31.690]  bridge.
[21:33.890 --> 21:34.770]  Thank you.
[21:37.170 --> 21:38.570]  Andrew's best efforts, we did it.
[21:38.570 --> 21:39.690]  It flipped on Nick.
[21:40.230 --> 21:42.590]  I'm alive, but only just.
[21:43.430 --> 21:45.230]  Alright, daddy made it.
[21:45.330 --> 21:46.270]  And I got a new checkpoint.
[21:47.190 --> 21:49.370]  Oh, this is gonna be fucked.
[21:51.270 --> 21:52.230]  Oh, no.
[21:54.250 --> 21:55.210]  Hang on.
[21:55.730 --> 21:56.690]  Oh, damn it.
[21:56.930 --> 21:57.190]  Easy.
[21:58.390 --> 21:59.450]  You landed on me.
[22:00.250 --> 22:03.110]  Alright, so should we unhook the chain and just ride it?
[22:03.710 --> 22:03.870]  Yeah.
[22:04.270 --> 22:06.970]  Well, I think we're supposed to unhook the chain, ride it, and then...
[22:07.950 --> 22:09.850]  hook it on this other one?
[22:11.130 --> 22:11.810]  Do you see that?
[22:12.290 --> 22:14.110]  Well, we can grab that as we go under it.
[22:14.110 --> 22:15.070]  Yep, hands up.
[22:15.890 --> 22:17.110]  Alright, is everyone on?
[22:17.390 --> 22:18.470]  No, I'm here.
[22:19.110 --> 22:20.390]  Alright, let's do it.
[22:21.190 --> 22:22.750]  Alright, I can unhook it on the right here.
[22:22.890 --> 22:23.450]  Hands up.
[22:25.350 --> 22:26.310]  Hands up for Detroit.
[22:26.510 --> 22:28.030]  Alright, I'm gonna pull the thing off.
[22:29.030 --> 22:30.930]  We're off the chain. We're off the frickin' chain.
[22:31.150 --> 22:31.710]  Unhook us.
[22:32.790 --> 22:33.310]  Alright, here we go.
[22:34.350 --> 22:36.070]  Oh, I think Geoff is holding on to me.
[22:36.110 --> 22:37.170]  I got a great view of this.
[22:37.170 --> 22:38.130]  Everybody, hands up.
[22:38.650 --> 22:41.530]  I think the physics on this will cause us to die.
[22:42.390 --> 22:42.750]  No, no.
[22:43.090 --> 22:43.770]  Hands up.
[22:45.330 --> 22:47.730]  Jump. There. Nope. Yep.
[22:48.130 --> 22:48.470]  Got it.
[22:49.030 --> 22:49.730]  Alright, let go.
[22:51.490 --> 22:52.810]  You need someone to...
[22:53.750 --> 22:54.650]  Oh, no.
[22:54.830 --> 22:57.190]  Oh, no.
[22:57.550 --> 22:58.290]  Oh, no.
[22:59.010 --> 22:59.590]  Oh, God.
[23:01.090 --> 23:01.530]  No!
[23:02.310 --> 23:03.310]  Why'd you jump off?
[23:03.490 --> 23:04.790]  Gavin, why'd you leave the boat?
[23:06.570 --> 23:07.450]  You lunatic.
[23:07.870 --> 23:09.470]  Well, someone should've...
[23:09.470 --> 23:10.530]  The chain.
[23:12.330 --> 23:14.310]  You were the last one on the boat.
[23:14.450 --> 23:15.590]  You were our last hope.
[23:15.790 --> 23:16.430]  We'll get the boat back.
[23:17.390 --> 23:19.730]  It's like if Luke Skywalker was like, oh, I just went home.
[23:20.090 --> 23:20.970]  New boat. Boat's back.
[23:21.570 --> 23:21.890]  Oh, okay.
[23:23.690 --> 23:25.930]  We gotta get over to the left here.
[23:25.990 --> 23:26.730]  Oh, shit.
[23:26.730 --> 23:27.350]  Gavin!
[23:29.750 --> 23:30.590]  Fucking asshole.
[23:31.430 --> 23:32.750]  We're almost there, Gavin.
[23:33.650 --> 23:34.650]  Grab the chain, Eric.
[23:35.170 --> 23:35.610]  I'm trying.
[23:36.630 --> 23:37.910]  Don't let go of me, Andrew!
[23:38.650 --> 23:40.110]  I was trying to grab you while you grabbed the chain.
[23:41.010 --> 23:41.370]  I've got it.
[23:41.790 --> 23:42.370]  Oh, no.
[23:44.510 --> 23:45.350]  Hold me.
[23:46.490 --> 23:47.170]  I'm trying.
[23:47.830 --> 23:50.050]  I'll try to pull you up via the chain.
[23:51.030 --> 23:52.250]  Do I have you?
[23:53.070 --> 23:53.670]  Via me.
[23:56.350 --> 23:57.830]  You let go!
[24:00.970 --> 24:02.190]  I can't lift it.
[24:02.250 --> 24:03.030]  It's too heavy.
[24:04.290 --> 24:05.070]  Oh, shit.
[24:07.070 --> 24:07.930]  What does this do?
[24:09.350 --> 24:10.310]  Oh, you made it.
[24:10.490 --> 24:10.950]  I found another boat.
[24:10.950 --> 24:11.750]  I hit a switch.
[24:12.050 --> 24:12.550]  What'd it do?
[24:12.770 --> 24:13.170]  New boat.
[24:14.050 --> 24:15.570]  Geoff, our ride's here.
[24:16.070 --> 24:16.610]  No, Eric!
[24:17.610 --> 24:18.710]  Oh, my God.
[24:19.110 --> 24:19.510]  What?
[24:20.930 --> 24:21.590]  Gavin, you...
[24:21.590 --> 24:23.970]  What we have to do is so fucked.
[24:24.390 --> 24:25.170]  Well, have fun.
[24:26.690 --> 24:28.190]  What do you keep saying I'm doing?
[24:28.270 --> 24:29.370]  The boat just goes.
[24:29.550 --> 24:31.230]  Right, you got on it and you left us.
[24:32.010 --> 24:33.590]  It goes when you get on it.
[24:34.270 --> 24:35.030]  It goes when you go.
[24:35.570 --> 24:37.850]  Andrew, so there's that boat.
[24:38.050 --> 24:39.630]  We need to get this box
[24:39.630 --> 24:41.470]  and put it on this switch.
[24:41.570 --> 24:43.870]  But if you make that jump...
[24:43.870 --> 24:45.170]  Oh, I was gonna say keep going
[24:45.170 --> 24:47.710]  because that door over there is where we need to go.
[24:50.630 --> 24:51.270]  Oh, Andrew.
[24:51.390 --> 24:53.890]  If you can make it through that door, I think we're good.
[24:53.990 --> 24:55.410]  If you can make it through that door, I think we're good.
[24:56.450 --> 24:58.050]  Oh, Andrew, why did you take the box?
[24:58.150 --> 24:59.170]  I thought we needed the box.
[24:59.470 --> 25:02.050]  I told you we didn't need the box anymore.
[25:02.110 --> 25:03.590]  Gavin, do you think you can make that all the way across?
[25:04.010 --> 25:06.070]  Look at Nick and Geoff over on that little raft.
[25:08.270 --> 25:09.550]  What's so funny about us
[25:10.090 --> 25:11.870]  using the same mode of transportation
[25:11.870 --> 25:12.150]  as you?
[25:13.890 --> 25:14.830]  That's funny to you?
[25:15.150 --> 25:17.970]  You think it's funny that we had to wait
[25:17.970 --> 25:19.730]  six times while you had fun?
[25:21.530 --> 25:22.570]  Yes, I admit
[25:22.570 --> 25:23.390]  that does sound funny.
[25:23.590 --> 25:25.990]  If it was me, I would have lapped my ass off.
[25:26.810 --> 25:27.730]  You did it. Go ahead.
[25:28.450 --> 25:28.950]  All the way.
[25:32.390 --> 25:33.190]  You can get off now.
[25:35.510 --> 25:36.150]  Now you can get off.
[25:37.290 --> 25:41.250]  Oh, there he is.
[25:41.610 --> 25:44.110]  There seems to be a boat.
[25:45.370 --> 25:45.810]  On my way.
[25:45.810 --> 25:48.430]  We should all get on together.
[25:48.670 --> 25:48.930]  Alright.
[25:49.290 --> 25:51.170]  And Nick took off.
[25:51.750 --> 25:53.450]  Get out now.
[25:54.230 --> 25:54.870]  Nick.
[25:57.510 --> 25:57.870]  What happened?
[26:00.470 --> 26:01.110]  Well...
[26:01.110 --> 26:01.410]  Fuck.
[26:02.390 --> 26:04.430]  That's exactly how I feel.
[26:05.390 --> 26:06.330]  It's just
[26:06.330 --> 26:07.770]  slightly too tall.
[26:09.690 --> 26:09.930]  Here.
[26:11.030 --> 26:12.030]  Somebody stand on this.
[26:19.310 --> 26:21.210]  You guys are just knocking the shit
[26:21.210 --> 26:21.810]  out of Nick.
[26:22.530 --> 26:24.010]  I deserve it.
[26:25.510 --> 26:26.690]  Go, go, go.
[26:27.150 --> 26:28.750]  I love this game.
[26:30.430 --> 26:30.990]  Shit.
[26:32.250 --> 26:33.370]  Oh, Eric's on a tear.
[26:33.470 --> 26:33.930]  Look at this.
[26:34.210 --> 26:36.710]  I'm trying, but I can't quite get up.
[26:39.310 --> 26:40.650]  Go ahead, Geoff.
[26:40.970 --> 26:43.250]  Alright, Andrew just comes along and fucks it up
[26:43.250 --> 26:43.750]  for everybody.
[26:45.730 --> 26:46.590]  One second.
[26:46.590 --> 26:48.270]  There you go.
[26:48.810 --> 26:49.530]  You dick.
[26:51.370 --> 26:52.950]  It's easy. You just go like that and then you go
[26:52.950 --> 26:54.930]  boop. Oh, you just go like that, Geoff.
[26:55.610 --> 26:56.690]  Oh yeah, just go like that.
[26:56.790 --> 26:58.230]  It's easy when somebody's not behind you.
[26:59.410 --> 27:00.710]  Andrew, you worthless
[27:00.710 --> 27:01.690]  piece of shit.
[27:03.910 --> 27:05.110]  You just go like that and you go boop.
[27:05.890 --> 27:06.850]  Oh, you idiot.
[27:07.190 --> 27:07.570]  You idiot.
[27:09.630 --> 27:10.350]  You worthless
[27:10.870 --> 27:11.050]  turd.
[27:12.110 --> 27:13.950]  Where are we supposed to go?
[27:13.950 --> 27:14.750]  Oh, I fell.
[27:24.070 --> 27:25.390]  Son of a bitch.
[27:26.950 --> 27:28.290]  You'll never advance,
[27:28.710 --> 27:29.110]  motherfucker.
[27:29.750 --> 27:30.710]  You're not going anywhere.
[27:32.130 --> 27:34.690]  I got my mitts on you.
[27:37.670 --> 27:39.510]  We're glued together.
[27:39.910 --> 27:41.650]  Nick, pull us up. Where are you?
[27:41.650 --> 27:42.310]  I'm drowning.
[27:44.510 --> 27:45.850]  Andrew, pull us up.
[27:45.890 --> 27:46.950]  Yeah, pull us up, Andrew.
[27:47.070 --> 27:47.390]  One sec.
[27:49.810 --> 27:51.190]  Alright, Geoff, we got this.
[27:52.290 --> 27:53.590]  Alright, arm out, Geoff.
[27:53.910 --> 27:54.470]  Other arm out.
[27:55.910 --> 27:57.430]  And then full speed.
[28:04.960 --> 28:06.260]  I need help.
[28:10.880 --> 28:11.980]  Let's just kill ourselves.
[28:12.100 --> 28:13.100]  Somebody made it.
[28:14.120 --> 28:16.680]  I just jumped all the way across.
[28:16.880 --> 28:17.760]  That was amazing, Eric.
[28:18.060 --> 28:18.760]  Thank you.
[28:20.060 --> 28:22.540]  You guys, I kept looking back
[28:22.540 --> 28:23.740]  and you were just at the beginning.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.260]  I didn't understand what was happening.
[28:26.060 --> 28:29.360]  I can't rip my fucking arm out.
[28:31.160 --> 28:32.200]  Okay, so...
[28:32.820 --> 28:33.480]  Let's hook
[28:33.480 --> 28:34.340]  the rod for the stick.
[28:34.800 --> 28:35.040]  Yeah.
[28:35.800 --> 28:36.240]  Who's got the stick?
[28:36.240 --> 28:37.560]  Who's got the best hooking action?
[28:38.720 --> 28:39.440]  Geoff does.
[28:39.820 --> 28:41.400]  Geoff has the best hooking action.
[28:42.920 --> 28:43.840]  It's a team hook.
[28:43.960 --> 28:44.720]  I think it's a team hook.
[28:46.120 --> 28:47.860]  I'll throw myself to my doom for it.
[28:47.920 --> 28:48.620]  Here we go.
[28:49.300 --> 28:49.940]  Way to go, man.
[28:51.940 --> 28:52.880]  Alright, I'm pulling it up.
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.160]  I'm pulling it up.
[28:57.900 --> 28:59.820]  Let me go. We gotta get the stick.
[29:00.180 --> 29:01.200]  We gotta get the stick, Eric.
[29:02.200 --> 29:02.800]  The stick.
[29:02.800 --> 29:04.600]  The stick. Let me go.
[29:07.060 --> 29:10.720]  Alright, stick hook.
[29:10.820 --> 29:12.040]  Let's try this again.
[29:12.940 --> 29:14.860]  I'm gonna hook it for us.
[29:15.860 --> 29:16.900]  You and you alone.
[29:17.640 --> 29:18.200]  Yeah, just you.
[29:20.220 --> 29:21.400]  Oh, hold on.
[29:21.520 --> 29:22.020]  Oh, that worked!
[29:22.840 --> 29:23.140]  Eric!
[29:24.120 --> 29:24.620]  Eric!
[29:26.860 --> 29:27.360]  Eric!
[29:27.360 --> 29:27.380]  Stick!
[29:31.300 --> 29:31.720]  No!
[29:31.920 --> 29:33.040]  That just made it easier!
[29:41.360 --> 29:42.960]  Why do I keep losing the stick?
[29:44.240 --> 29:45.460]  Everyone leave the stick.
[29:45.660 --> 29:46.860]  One person on the stick.
[29:47.180 --> 29:47.980]  Alright, you two on the stick.
[29:48.300 --> 29:49.560]  You killed me with the stick.
[29:51.560 --> 29:52.920]  Hook the raft!
[29:53.900 --> 29:54.700]  Where are you going?
[29:55.780 --> 29:56.860]  Everybody, come on.
[29:56.940 --> 29:57.860]  We gotta do this.
[29:58.560 --> 30:00.620]  I can't do it with one hand. It's gonna take more than me.
[30:00.740 --> 30:02.000]  Well, you have...
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.760]  Let go of the stick!
[30:05.680 --> 30:07.280]  That's why it's a team activity!
[30:07.480 --> 30:08.280]  You're in the water!
[30:18.640 --> 30:19.800]  Everybody on the stick!
[30:19.880 --> 30:22.020]  Everybody on the stick.
[30:22.020 --> 30:23.520]  Here we go!
[30:24.520 --> 30:26.920]  The person in the front keeps bending the stick.
[30:27.060 --> 30:27.940]  Andrew, hook it. Yes!
[30:28.280 --> 30:29.660]  We'll do it together.
[30:31.900 --> 30:32.440]  Let go!
[30:32.900 --> 30:33.620]  Let go, Andrew.
[30:34.360 --> 30:36.140]  Let go. You're in the water. Just let it go.
[30:36.520 --> 30:37.480]  You're a liability.
[30:38.140 --> 30:38.740]  Let go of the stick!
[30:41.260 --> 30:41.660]  Pull!
[30:42.580 --> 30:43.900]  Let go of the stick!
[30:44.320 --> 30:45.500]  Alright, that's it. Hold me.
[30:46.180 --> 30:47.180]  Okay, got you.
[30:49.100 --> 30:50.100]  Alright, push Gavin.
[30:50.100 --> 30:51.820]  Got it. Here we go.
[30:52.270 --> 30:54.480]  Pull! Andrew, no!
[30:55.740 --> 30:58.520]  Andrew, you absolute...
[30:58.520 --> 30:59.180]  Pull it back!
[30:59.620 --> 31:00.300]  Pull it back!
[31:00.840 --> 31:01.840]  Okay, we've got it.
[31:01.840 --> 31:03.200]  We got it.
[31:04.640 --> 31:06.160]  Alright, everyone on.
[31:07.440 --> 31:08.340]  Oh yeah, everyone on.
[31:09.560 --> 31:10.720]  Geoff, you're killing me.
[31:11.700 --> 31:12.660]  We got it.
[31:12.700 --> 31:13.140]  We'll be there.
[31:16.220 --> 31:18.740]  What are all these rocks for?
[31:18.740 --> 31:21.960]  Oh, it's for weighing down the bucket, maybe.
[31:25.280 --> 31:27.160]  Maybe one person holds the chain.
[31:30.320 --> 31:32.100]  Oh, do we need the stick?
[31:32.320 --> 31:33.480]  Yeah, we need the stick, I think.
[31:33.900 --> 31:34.780]  Oh, great hook.
[31:35.040 --> 31:35.500]  Thank you!
[31:36.600 --> 31:37.520]  Oh, balls.
[31:38.320 --> 31:39.840]  Andrew keeps spitting the stick.
[31:40.200 --> 31:42.660]  Andrew can't get enough of knocking the stick over.
[31:43.940 --> 31:45.640]  This is so much better than
[31:45.640 --> 31:46.280]  Crash Team Racing.
[31:46.280 --> 31:46.520]  Pull me!
[31:49.200 --> 31:49.640]  Geoff, I'm coming!
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.460]  I'm yanking you by the noggin!
[31:53.280 --> 31:54.000]  Pull Geoff!
[31:54.240 --> 31:57.120]  Alright, Geoff, let's do this.
[31:57.880 --> 31:58.600]  Let one...
[31:58.600 --> 31:59.060]  Okay.
[31:59.760 --> 32:02.120]  Let someone cook.
[32:02.340 --> 32:03.760]  Oh god, it's Andrew. Go for it, Andrew.
[32:06.100 --> 32:06.460]  Cook!
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.800]  Well, that was a desk dog.
[32:11.160 --> 32:13.060]  Now, I have a great camera angle
[32:13.060 --> 32:14.640]  of all this, so I'm just going to keep it right here.
[32:14.640 --> 32:15.580]  Alright, check this out.
[32:16.260 --> 32:17.660]  Geoff, thanks for the support.
[32:18.600 --> 32:18.960]  Shit!
[32:21.860 --> 32:22.880]  I backed off?
[32:23.020 --> 32:24.720]  Oh shit, that almost crushed me!
[32:25.160 --> 32:25.760]  Yeah, watch out.
[32:26.380 --> 32:27.240]  Alright, you want to do it, Geoff?
[32:27.820 --> 32:30.760]  I want Gavin to do it, but he fucking fell in the ocean.
[32:31.000 --> 32:31.980]  You're using one hand, Geoff.
[32:32.520 --> 32:33.800]  I only have one good hand.
[32:34.220 --> 32:36.960]  Alright, here you go.
[32:37.360 --> 32:38.360]  I'm going to let you guys do it.
[32:38.680 --> 32:39.900]  Now, just pick up the front.
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.480]  Lift it up. That's it.
[32:43.300 --> 32:44.460]  Oh my god.
[32:46.660 --> 32:47.460]  Okay, it didn't work.
[32:47.720 --> 32:48.560]  Alright, you go ahead, Gavin.
[32:48.640 --> 32:49.340]  I'll grab you.
[32:51.180 --> 32:52.740]  After he gets it hooked.
[32:52.980 --> 32:55.000]  Yeah, after he gets it hooked, you grab him.
[32:55.520 --> 32:56.080]  Nice hook!
[32:56.760 --> 32:57.980]  There you go, guys.
[32:58.160 --> 32:58.680]  Alright, get in!
[33:00.020 --> 33:00.840]  I'm holding it.
[33:03.260 --> 33:04.380]  Come on, Gavin!
[33:04.740 --> 33:06.980]  But we need the stick, don't we?
[33:08.040 --> 33:08.480]  Do we?
[33:09.000 --> 33:09.720]  I don't know.
[33:11.760 --> 33:12.500]  What are you?
[33:12.660 --> 33:13.400]  The answer man?
[33:15.120 --> 33:16.980]  What is the answer man?
[33:17.720 --> 33:18.460]  Laugh, funny man.
[33:19.060 --> 33:19.840]  That's another show.
[33:19.940 --> 33:21.000]  Probably need the stick.
[33:22.840 --> 33:24.260]  I wonder if I can go under.
[33:25.600 --> 33:26.580]  Here, I'll help.
[33:27.520 --> 33:28.440]  I wonder if we need the stick.
[33:29.460 --> 33:30.380]  I'm thinking we might.
[33:32.140 --> 33:32.540]  Well...
[33:32.540 --> 33:33.480]  Andrew's got the stick.
[33:33.820 --> 33:36.420]  I think we need it because how else are we going to reach up there?
[33:36.420 --> 33:38.040]  No, we need to put the rocks in the thing
[33:38.040 --> 33:39.700]  So it goes underneath this
[33:39.700 --> 33:42.580]  Right, but then what?
[33:43.180 --> 33:44.440]  Then we get on it.
[33:45.480 --> 33:46.480]  And we sink.
[33:46.860 --> 33:47.220]  Easy!
[33:48.880 --> 33:50.660]  And then, Nick, I'm not asking...
[33:50.660 --> 33:52.300]  That's like, where are we going next? Car.
[33:52.600 --> 33:53.560]  That's not what I'm asking.
[33:55.060 --> 33:56.340]  I'm asking what is the destination
[33:56.340 --> 33:57.320]  after we get in.
[33:58.100 --> 33:59.740]  There's a bend, we'll go around it.
[34:01.080 --> 34:02.560]  Geoff, get the stick off Andrew.
[34:03.340 --> 34:04.960]  I can't, I'm in the boat with you.
[34:05.140 --> 34:06.160]  Eric, get the stick off Andrew.
[34:06.160 --> 34:08.640]  There's two freaking luchadors screwing me up.
[34:08.720 --> 34:10.880]  I can't, I can't get this.
[34:11.020 --> 34:11.900]  He's all the way over there.
[34:11.960 --> 34:12.940]  How am I supposed to get the stick?
[34:14.080 --> 34:14.720]  Get ready.
[34:16.500 --> 34:17.160]  It's not long.
[34:17.500 --> 34:19.020]  Go to sleep. It's okay.
[34:22.140 --> 34:23.020]  It doesn't read.
[34:24.520 --> 34:26.240]  I think you guys need to get rid of the rocks.
[34:27.040 --> 34:28.040]  Okay, let's get rid of the rocks.
[34:28.120 --> 34:28.800]  I can't see them.
[34:29.880 --> 34:31.440]  We got too many people in there, that's why.
[34:31.860 --> 34:33.160]  Oh shit, I've fallen over. I can't get up.
[34:33.160 --> 34:33.640]  I'm drowning.
[34:35.380 --> 34:36.960]  Oh, Nick's back at the beginning.
[34:38.120 --> 34:38.840]  Stop it!
[34:39.000 --> 34:39.980]  Geoff drowned me.
[34:43.920 --> 34:45.640]  Alright, Geoff, get rid of the rocks.
[34:46.020 --> 34:47.920]  He just held our heads under the water.
[34:48.680 --> 34:50.160]  It was like I drowned in a bog.
[34:51.840 --> 34:53.340]  The rocks are gone.
[34:53.820 --> 34:54.020]  Okay.
[34:55.580 --> 34:56.620]  We're doing something.
[34:56.920 --> 34:58.480]  Alright, who's on the other side?
[34:59.300 --> 35:01.000]  Me and Geoff are on this raft.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.100]  Yeah man, we're de-rocking.
[35:03.400 --> 35:04.600]  Yeah, but now what?
[35:05.440 --> 35:06.800]  We need to use the stick.
[35:07.520 --> 35:09.420]  How the fuck do we get up here?
[35:10.100 --> 35:11.660]  I think we just need to get around this corner.
[35:12.640 --> 35:14.200]  I don't think it fits.
[35:14.680 --> 35:15.220]  Get your hips.
[35:15.320 --> 35:16.460]  Andrew, walk along the stick.
[35:17.260 --> 35:18.260]  I got your hips.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.040]  I'll walk along the stick if you can hold it steady. Ready?
[35:24.880 --> 35:26.920]  I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you!
[35:27.240 --> 35:28.960]  Maybe we jump off here?
[35:28.960 --> 35:30.920]  Maybe? You wanna give it a shot?
[35:31.620 --> 35:32.500]  Nick, are you on the stick?
[35:32.980 --> 35:34.580]  No, we lost him!
[35:34.800 --> 35:37.140]  Oh dude, we have to go up.
[35:37.200 --> 35:38.660]  There's a lever up here.
[35:38.780 --> 35:39.440]  Lift Gavin.
[35:39.700 --> 35:41.620]  I got it now.
[35:42.620 --> 35:44.560]  We were too heavy with both of us on there.
[35:45.880 --> 35:46.760]  Yeah, Geoff!
[35:47.720 --> 35:48.320]  It's not long enough.
[35:50.200 --> 35:54.060]  Dude, I knew something good would come out of strangling Gavin to death.
[35:54.360 --> 35:54.900]  Yeah, no kidding.
[35:55.320 --> 35:55.760]  Finally.
[35:55.760 --> 35:57.220]  You've been saying it for years too.
[35:58.400 --> 35:59.140]  You got it.
[35:59.140 --> 36:00.320]  I don't think we need the stick, guys.
[36:00.660 --> 36:01.060]  Big jump, big jump, amigo.
[36:03.440 --> 36:04.680]  There you go!
[36:04.780 --> 36:06.760]  Looks like we didn't need the stick at all.
[36:07.500 --> 36:09.280]  Geoff is a monster!
[36:09.700 --> 36:10.420]  Look at this!
[36:11.460 --> 36:12.860]  What did that do?
[36:13.720 --> 36:14.480]  Oh, it brings the whole thing down.
[36:14.480 --> 36:15.200]  Oh, the thing's moving!
[36:17.520 --> 36:19.080]  Can you get to here from it?
[36:20.420 --> 36:21.580]  There you go, there you go.
[36:21.800 --> 36:23.640]  Okay, and then send it.
[36:23.940 --> 36:24.780]  And let's see where it puts me.
[36:24.780 --> 36:25.580]  Let's fucking send it.
[36:26.820 --> 36:27.940]  Fucking send it, bud.
[36:31.240 --> 36:32.660]  Am I going up somewhere?
[36:33.260 --> 36:34.520]  Yeah, it looks like you're going up somewhere.
[36:35.320 --> 36:36.120]  Where though?
[36:36.440 --> 36:38.960]  Way up. Big time, dude. Big time up.
[36:39.440 --> 36:40.340]  Is it like...
[36:40.340 --> 36:43.380]  It's like a funicular. You're going way up to the top of the mountain.
[36:43.660 --> 36:44.340]  Oh, they're going up.
[36:44.620 --> 36:46.260]  You look really good up there.
[36:47.460 --> 36:48.080]  Thanks, boys.
[36:49.500 --> 36:51.380]  Hey, thanks for sending us on a wild goose chase.
[36:52.100 --> 36:52.500]  Majestic.
[36:53.200 --> 36:54.460]  I mean, we figured it out.
[36:54.540 --> 36:56.240]  You guys keep trying to get that stick if you want.
[36:56.360 --> 36:57.160]  Yeah, we tried to figure it out.
[36:57.160 --> 37:00.760]  I'm sorry, Nick. You were the egg I had to break by drowning you to figure this out.
[37:00.840 --> 37:01.600]  Is the omelette good?
[37:02.140 --> 37:02.780]  It's delicious.
[37:03.280 --> 37:05.860]  It's weird because he's not apologizing to Gavin.
[37:11.460 --> 37:13.520]  That's the worst lift I've ever seen.
[37:15.200 --> 37:16.960]  Have you seen that video of the ski lift
[37:16.960 --> 37:18.840]  that the brakes failed
[37:18.840 --> 37:20.280]  and it started shooting everyone down backwards?
[37:21.020 --> 37:21.900]  Wow, really?
[37:23.220 --> 37:24.580]  That is like...
[37:24.580 --> 37:26.500]  I think my wife would be so afraid of that.
[37:26.680 --> 37:28.380]  There's people just telling everyone to jump off
[37:28.380 --> 37:30.140]  and some people don't get off and they just get
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.200]  wangled around the side of it.
[37:32.280 --> 37:34.880]  It's crazy. I can't believe no one died.
[37:35.360 --> 37:35.800]  Okay, die.
[37:36.540 --> 37:37.340]  Die, boys.
[37:37.600 --> 37:39.760]  Gotta go die.
[37:40.820 --> 37:41.880]  Oh, shit. I'm only...
[37:41.880 --> 37:42.840]  I missed.
[37:42.840 --> 37:43.900]  I missed.
[37:44.460 --> 37:49.200]  I'm having real trouble getting up
[37:49.200 --> 37:50.200]  from off the...
[37:50.200 --> 37:52.640]  How did you die before I did? I was down there forever.
[37:54.080 --> 37:54.640]  Get good.
[37:55.720 --> 37:56.160]  Okay.
[37:56.700 --> 37:57.540]  Oh, no.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.020]  Oh, no.
[38:01.660 --> 38:02.720]  So are we unhooking this?
[38:02.880 --> 38:04.900]  Oh, is that a lilo?
[38:05.080 --> 38:06.900]  Oh, we have to ride that down the rapids.
[38:07.640 --> 38:09.400]  Yeah, this is gonna be crazy.
[38:09.580 --> 38:10.880]  Someone has to open the door.
[38:10.880 --> 38:11.520]  Oh, that's cool.
[38:12.180 --> 38:14.500]  I'll open the door so I get a good camera shot.
[38:14.600 --> 38:15.680]  You guys jump on the raft.
[38:15.920 --> 38:18.280]  Why don't we all jump on the raft when it's at the door?
[38:18.660 --> 38:20.040]  I think that switch is...
[38:20.040 --> 38:21.660]  The switch is what?
[38:22.020 --> 38:23.160]  It's for the cable car.
[38:25.040 --> 38:25.420]  Oh.
[38:26.880 --> 38:28.620]  This thing unchains it.
[38:29.460 --> 38:30.240]  Does it?
[38:30.680 --> 38:30.880]  Yeah.
[38:32.060 --> 38:33.960]  So when you do that, when we hit it with the raft,
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.140]  it'll knock all that shit down.
[38:35.660 --> 38:37.040]  Okay, so everyone get on the raft.
[38:37.040 --> 38:39.180]  It looks like a bunch of hot dogs.
[38:40.080 --> 38:41.920]  Oh, I'm gonna grab onto the ground.
[38:42.300 --> 38:42.420]  Geoff!
[38:44.140 --> 38:44.460]  What?
[38:45.020 --> 38:46.460]  You kicked it into the middle.
[38:47.020 --> 38:49.500]  No, I jumped on when they kicked it to the middle
[38:49.500 --> 38:50.820]  and I just grabbed on as it was going.
[38:50.900 --> 38:53.280]  Okay, so I pulled this thing, but what does it do?
[38:53.480 --> 38:55.180]  Put it on the cable car and send it down.
[38:55.940 --> 38:56.180]  Yeah.
[38:58.860 --> 38:59.160]  Dude.
[38:59.900 --> 39:01.040]  Gavin the genius.
[39:01.520 --> 39:02.720]  Don't say it yet!
[39:03.380 --> 39:03.820]  Moron!
[39:03.820 --> 39:06.180]  Fucking idiot.
[39:06.280 --> 39:08.020]  I just thought you'd do it. I believed in you too much.
[39:08.100 --> 39:08.940]  That was on me. I'm sorry.
[39:09.900 --> 39:11.320]  I believed in you as much as I did.
[39:11.960 --> 39:12.940]  Guys, don't fight.
[39:13.300 --> 39:14.940]  Don't fight. Get on with it.
[39:15.180 --> 39:17.360]  Hook it on, send it off, and jump on.
[39:18.220 --> 39:19.700]  Guys! No! No!
[39:20.920 --> 39:21.640]  Blame Andrew.
[39:21.880 --> 39:22.260]  Careful, Gavin.
[39:23.720 --> 39:25.560]  Our dogs are idling. Hurry up.
[39:27.220 --> 39:28.460]  I'm holding onto the raft.
[39:29.260 --> 39:29.700]  Just waiting.
[39:30.360 --> 39:31.060]  Oh, yes. Nice.
[39:31.060 --> 39:32.980]  Okay, we're in. Go.
[39:33.180 --> 39:34.300]  Get ready to jump on, guys.
[39:35.160 --> 39:36.220]  Let's go, sellers.
[39:37.720 --> 39:38.400]  Arms out.
[39:39.040 --> 39:41.140]  There it goes!
[39:42.660 --> 39:43.260]  Cowabunga!
[39:43.740 --> 39:44.780]  Hang on. Easy.
[39:45.100 --> 39:46.400]  Bury it. I'm on.
[39:47.660 --> 39:49.240]  Oh, Andrew.
[39:49.740 --> 39:50.840]  Oh, he did it.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.720]  Alright, boys. Let's do it.
[39:53.240 --> 39:53.760]  Get it!
[39:55.200 --> 39:55.800]  No!
[39:57.180 --> 39:57.780]  No!
[39:58.340 --> 39:58.900]  Wee!
[40:00.200 --> 40:01.820]  Let go of me, Geoff!
[40:02.300 --> 40:03.700]  Grab the terrain.
[40:03.920 --> 40:04.540]  I'm back!
[40:06.460 --> 40:07.980]  Geoff, that's me!
[40:08.660 --> 40:09.900]  I'm holding onto you.
[40:09.940 --> 40:11.880]  I don't want to lose you. I can't lose you, Nick.
[40:12.320 --> 40:13.560]  Grab and jump.
[40:13.720 --> 40:15.340]  Keep pushing it.
[40:15.760 --> 40:17.120]  Oh, no.
[40:17.500 --> 40:19.380]  Hold on!
[40:20.080 --> 40:21.300]  Oh, no.
[40:23.180 --> 40:23.740]  Whoa!
[40:25.060 --> 40:25.420]  Gavin!
[40:26.380 --> 40:28.080]  Wait, I think that's where we needed to go.
[40:28.120 --> 40:29.200]  You didn't get off.
[40:29.600 --> 40:29.960]  No!
[40:32.340 --> 40:33.720]  It's more fun this way.
[40:35.740 --> 40:37.340]  Okay, we started the watermill thing.
[40:37.800 --> 40:40.040]  We did, and I think I know what the next step is.
[40:41.560 --> 40:42.400]  To have more fun?
[40:42.620 --> 40:43.260]  Oh, no.
[40:49.420 --> 40:50.400]  Hands up for Detroit.
[40:52.520 --> 40:53.580]  Wait, wait. Why did it stop?
[40:53.580 --> 40:54.980]  There's too many of us on it!
[40:55.600 --> 40:57.580]  Oh, cool. I wonder who should let go.
[40:57.740 --> 40:58.260]  I let go.
[40:59.300 --> 41:02.200]  Oh, no, it's because Geoff was standing in front of it.
[41:03.100 --> 41:03.500]  Andrew!
[41:04.940 --> 41:05.340]  What?
[41:05.980 --> 41:06.300]  Nothing.
[41:08.080 --> 41:10.080]  It's stuck again. Why is it going backwards?
[41:10.420 --> 41:11.960]  Well, there's too many of us on it.
[41:12.340 --> 41:14.120]  Yes, I wonder who should let go.
[41:14.600 --> 41:15.040]  I let go.
[41:15.980 --> 41:18.340]  Can we aim it more under the waterfall so we can all get on?
[41:20.140 --> 41:22.200]  Aim it more under the waterfall?
[41:22.200 --> 41:24.340]  How do you aim it?
[41:24.600 --> 41:26.600]  Maybe there's a turner.
[41:27.680 --> 41:28.180]  A turner?
[41:28.420 --> 41:29.560]  Maybe there's a turner.
[41:30.240 --> 41:31.180]  I didn't think of that.
[41:31.900 --> 41:32.980]  Come on, get up.
[41:34.620 --> 41:36.360]  No! I'm so close!
[41:36.560 --> 41:36.700]  No!
[41:38.040 --> 41:39.440]  Did you mess it up?
[41:40.580 --> 41:41.480]  Oh, my God.
[41:41.600 --> 41:44.640]  You have to get all the way to the top.
[41:45.600 --> 41:47.360]  When you're at the top, Nick,
[41:47.440 --> 41:49.400]  let us know because we'll grab it to stop it.
[41:49.400 --> 41:49.900]  I'm at the top!
[41:49.900 --> 41:51.280]  Grab it!
[41:51.960 --> 41:52.940]  I missed it.
[41:54.120 --> 41:55.760]  Did you mess it up?
[41:56.360 --> 41:57.060]  I didn't say that.
[41:57.380 --> 41:58.560]  I know.
[42:00.140 --> 42:02.280]  I wasn't doing your voice.
[42:04.100 --> 42:06.080]  You were doing me and sawing Nick,
[42:06.120 --> 42:06.880]  but I didn't do that.
[42:07.920 --> 42:09.080]  I was sawing Eric.
[42:09.580 --> 42:12.000]  Andrew, let go of the wheel!
[42:12.560 --> 42:13.360]  I'll let go of the wheel.
[42:13.860 --> 42:15.040]  Andrew's on there. There he goes.
[42:16.860 --> 42:17.800]  Andrew's still on there.
[42:18.680 --> 42:20.580]  That actually worked, Andrew.
[42:25.620 --> 42:27.960]  Once you're up there,
[42:28.040 --> 42:29.880]  you have to go. There's a switch to hit,
[42:30.180 --> 42:30.820]  I think.
[42:36.660 --> 42:37.600]  Did you make it?
[42:38.640 --> 42:39.180]  Nice!
[42:44.520 --> 42:45.480]  Sounds promising.
[42:45.920 --> 42:47.440]  It's a lot of noises without seeing any.
[42:53.900 --> 42:55.700]  Did you flip the switch?
[42:56.340 --> 42:57.440]  He's not there yet.
[42:58.500 --> 42:59.400]  I missed!
[43:05.060 --> 43:05.680]  Close.
[43:10.180 --> 43:11.200]  I kind of see him.
[43:11.660 --> 43:12.360]  You're almost there.
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.680]  You're almost there, buddy.
[43:21.220 --> 43:21.660]  Nick!
[43:22.440 --> 43:23.000]  Eric's right.
[43:23.180 --> 43:24.460]  I got it!
[43:25.240 --> 43:25.960]  I'll help you.
[43:27.020 --> 43:29.580]  Pull up his head, Nick.
[43:30.740 --> 43:31.240]  Two hands.
[43:32.500 --> 43:33.240]  Grab the ground.
[43:33.760 --> 43:34.440]  Grab my ear.
[43:34.780 --> 43:35.120]  I got you.
[43:37.420 --> 43:38.140]  Pull me up.
[43:39.680 --> 43:42.220]  I've got such a great angle of you going
[43:42.220 --> 43:43.180]  up the wheel right now.
[43:44.140 --> 43:45.380]  Which way do we turn this thing?
[43:46.800 --> 43:47.580]  Flip the switch.
[43:47.580 --> 43:49.100]  Pull it. I don't know how to yank it.
[43:50.260 --> 43:51.740]  Does it turn the fan on?
[43:51.860 --> 43:52.880]  Or turn the opener thing on?
[43:53.180 --> 43:54.480]  You opened it.
[43:56.780 --> 43:58.160]  Now we have to go across.
[43:58.200 --> 43:58.580]  What the?
[44:00.200 --> 44:01.420]  It just says loading.
[44:02.440 --> 44:03.360]  Andrew jumped in.
[44:03.520 --> 44:04.140]  Next level.
[44:04.460 --> 44:05.680]  We did it!
[44:07.340 --> 44:07.780]  Wow.
[44:10.540 --> 44:12.040]  Did we do it or
[44:12.040 --> 44:12.540]  what's up?
[44:13.540 --> 44:15.140]  That means we beat the game or whatever.
[44:15.140 --> 44:15.720]  Yeah, it's over.
[44:18.120 --> 44:18.840]  Disconnect everything.
[44:19.500 --> 44:20.020]  Shut it down.
[44:20.640 --> 44:21.300]  Do we need the cables?
[44:22.440 --> 44:23.880]  I can't imagine that we would.
[44:25.180 --> 44:26.860]  You think we don't need these cables?
[44:27.280 --> 44:28.460]  Oh guys, we need the cables.
[44:31.000 --> 44:32.260]  But Geoff just told me we did.
[44:32.420 --> 44:33.840]  Are we going to keep playing?
[44:34.080 --> 44:35.660]  Is this going to be a long video?
[44:35.820 --> 44:36.860]  Is anyone stopping play?
[44:38.820 --> 44:39.820]  No, we're still going.
[44:39.940 --> 44:40.260]  I got the cable.
[44:40.980 --> 44:41.940]  I got blue.
[44:42.420 --> 44:43.740]  I wasn't sure if we needed that.
[44:44.360 --> 44:44.760]  Ow.
[44:45.020 --> 44:47.760]  It seems that we might have needed it.
[44:47.760 --> 44:50.200]  Get this stick out of here.
[44:50.320 --> 44:52.020]  I'm trying to do some cabling work.
[44:52.100 --> 44:52.960]  The stick is a what?
[44:54.460 --> 44:55.440]  It's stuck in my leg.
[44:57.540 --> 44:58.620]  Gavin, what did you do?
[44:58.800 --> 45:00.100]  Now it's time to plug a cable in.
[45:00.240 --> 45:01.060]  He's an expert.
[45:02.300 --> 45:03.000]  It's stuck.
[45:06.760 --> 45:08.620]  You just plugged the red into the blue.
[45:08.900 --> 45:09.720]  I know.
[45:10.500 --> 45:11.760]  We're all dead now.
[45:11.860 --> 45:12.920]  Why do you know that?
[45:13.080 --> 45:14.740]  You shouldn't do that.
[45:16.220 --> 45:17.480]  It's stuck under my legs.
[45:18.620 --> 45:20.400]  Why are you guys both doing it at once?
[45:20.760 --> 45:21.980]  Too many chefs in the cables.
[45:22.460 --> 45:24.040]  One chef can't figure it out.
[45:24.920 --> 45:26.580]  One chef brought the cable
[45:26.580 --> 45:28.320]  and then suddenly I did it instantly.
[45:28.720 --> 45:29.900]  Alright, go Gavin. Let's leave him in the dust.
[45:29.980 --> 45:30.340]  Go, go, go.
[45:33.600 --> 45:34.420]  More cables.
[45:35.000 --> 45:35.540]  Not again.
[45:36.280 --> 45:38.340]  We've got to make a full...
[45:40.600 --> 45:40.960]  Yeah?
[45:41.420 --> 45:42.060]  What was that?
[45:42.240 --> 45:44.880]  Do we have to connect...
[45:45.680 --> 45:47.080]  Do we just connect this to that?
[45:47.300 --> 45:48.560]  What do you mean? It's a battery.
[45:48.760 --> 45:50.420]  You plugged the blue into the blue and the red into the red.
[45:50.640 --> 45:52.940]  I thought we had to charge it or something.
[45:54.360 --> 45:55.560]  I think it seems fine.
[45:55.660 --> 45:57.060]  I don't know why Andrew is taking it away.
[45:57.520 --> 45:58.820]  I want these cables.
[46:01.300 --> 46:02.280]  They're nice and long.
[46:02.300 --> 46:03.220]  They're nice and long cables.
[46:03.580 --> 46:04.260]  They're better cables.
[46:05.260 --> 46:07.320]  It sounds good, man.
[46:07.320 --> 46:08.260]  Why would we not?
[46:08.480 --> 46:11.640]  Get those cables, dude.
[46:11.680 --> 46:12.080]  You got it.
[46:12.540 --> 46:13.600]  There you go.
[46:15.680 --> 46:16.600]  Do you get that?
[46:16.820 --> 46:19.060]  We got the better cables over here.
[46:20.340 --> 46:21.360]  It's red. That's good.
[46:21.860 --> 46:21.960]  Good?
[46:29.980 --> 46:31.100]  Why do you need these cables?
[46:33.660 --> 46:36.400]  Why are you getting rid of the good cable?
[46:38.520 --> 46:39.960]  Why are you getting rid of the good one?
[46:40.220 --> 46:40.360]  Why are you getting rid of the good cable?
[46:40.360 --> 46:41.400]  Did you guys plug it in yet?
[46:41.400 --> 46:43.960]  We've wired the red to the red.
[46:44.840 --> 46:46.880]  I just want to put this in the other area.
[46:46.960 --> 46:47.920]  We might need better cables.
[46:48.260 --> 46:49.900]  Do we get it yet? Is it open?
[46:50.840 --> 46:51.520]  Not yet.
[46:51.980 --> 46:53.560]  Hurry. I don't know how much longer I can hold them.
[46:53.940 --> 46:55.280]  I'm just trying to move the cables.
[46:56.720 --> 46:57.380]  There we go.
[46:57.900 --> 46:58.460]  They're good.
[47:00.420 --> 47:01.440]  Bring the cables.
[47:02.060 --> 47:02.980]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[47:03.700 --> 47:05.240]  We're probably going to need those cables.
[47:05.700 --> 47:06.480]  He just killed the cable.
[47:07.500 --> 47:08.080]  Cable killer.
[47:08.080 --> 47:10.480]  Go ahead.
[47:18.340 --> 47:20.340]  I can't get up.
[47:20.500 --> 47:20.700]  Good.
[47:21.300 --> 47:23.080]  Stay there.
[47:23.280 --> 47:25.040]  I don't know what's going on.
[47:26.020 --> 47:27.080]  Let's go!
[47:28.060 --> 47:28.620]  You got it.
[47:29.400 --> 47:30.080]  Yeah!
[47:33.640 --> 47:34.580]  I missed.
[47:35.260 --> 47:37.040]  We have to pull the battery over here.
[47:38.580 --> 47:39.500]  I'm on the treadmill.
[47:41.520 --> 47:42.440]  What do you do now?
[47:43.220 --> 47:45.060]  I've got to get this box.
[47:52.480 --> 47:53.700]  Did you get the box?
[47:54.320 --> 47:54.540]  Yeah.
[47:55.180 --> 47:55.900]  What do you do now?
[47:56.080 --> 47:57.140]  I'm going to put the box on the treadmill.
[47:59.440 --> 48:00.000]  What? Why?
[48:00.380 --> 48:02.200]  So you can put it on the button.
[48:02.420 --> 48:04.340]  They could have just pulled the switch.
[48:04.740 --> 48:06.120]  Gavin, the box fell down.
[48:06.360 --> 48:07.280]  I already pulled the switch.
[48:07.380 --> 48:09.160]  That's how we got it to turn on.
[48:09.540 --> 48:13.280]  Acting like you cable fools know what's up.
[48:13.740 --> 48:14.440]  You weren't even here.
[48:16.160 --> 48:17.180]  Guys, we're falling apart.
[48:17.340 --> 48:18.240]  We're on the same team.
[48:20.080 --> 48:20.480]  Alright.
[48:20.800 --> 48:22.080]  We'll stand here with our arms up.
[48:22.640 --> 48:24.040]  Geoff, that's me!
[48:26.440 --> 48:28.280]  Go ahead and put that box on.
[48:28.480 --> 48:29.060]  You got it.
[48:29.340 --> 48:29.800]  There you go.
[48:31.680 --> 48:33.240]  Do you think we need it through here?
[48:35.940 --> 48:37.380]  Uh, I don't know.
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.900]  Oh, I think we have to charge this
[48:40.900 --> 48:42.080]  at the other station first.
[48:43.380 --> 48:44.480]  Wait, you got no power?
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.620]  I'm not sure, but I have a feeling
[48:47.620 --> 48:48.940]  because there's two stations here.
[48:50.320 --> 48:51.740]  Maybe we need the other wires.
[48:53.100 --> 48:55.540]  Why would you disconnect that end?
[48:56.460 --> 48:58.380]  So that way we can carry the whole thing over
[48:58.380 --> 49:00.440]  and then plug the blue and blue
[49:00.440 --> 49:01.100]  and the red, the red?
[49:01.360 --> 49:01.620]  Okay.
[49:02.920 --> 49:03.220]  Why would you disconnect that end?
[49:03.220 --> 49:05.320]  What was your preferred method?
[49:05.500 --> 49:07.520]  Why were the other cables? I thought we had two sets of cables.
[49:07.980 --> 49:09.100]  Andrew decided not to bring them.
[49:09.800 --> 49:11.240]  Why did Eric destroy it?
[49:13.520 --> 49:15.460]  I remember all the conversation about
[49:15.460 --> 49:17.100]  Andrew was supposed to bring the cables.
[49:17.460 --> 49:18.880]  I remember the same thing.
[49:19.100 --> 49:21.500]  He like made himself the cable guy.
[49:21.820 --> 49:23.220]  He's like, hey, look at me.
[49:23.340 --> 49:24.520]  I'm fucking Jim Carrey.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.040]  Nick just climbed the wall.
[49:27.120 --> 49:29.000]  Also, there's no power in the gate anymore.
[49:30.940 --> 49:31.240]  Bye!
[49:31.840 --> 49:33.240]  You need these cables?
[49:35.100 --> 49:36.000]  I made it.
[49:36.120 --> 49:37.860]  I made it. I'm in the next section.
[49:38.200 --> 49:39.400]  Yeah, me too.
[49:41.000 --> 49:41.880]  I'm with you, buddy.
[49:42.060 --> 49:42.360]  Hey, man.
[49:44.260 --> 49:45.720]  Why charge anything when we can
[49:45.720 --> 49:46.860]  just go around?
[49:47.060 --> 49:48.440]  There's a little red action.
[49:48.800 --> 49:49.940]  Is this thing locked?
[49:50.580 --> 49:53.260]  You have to grab the front and then pull.
[49:53.380 --> 49:55.300]  I did. I swore I did. Let's see.
[49:56.700 --> 49:57.120]  Yeah, look.
[49:57.760 --> 49:59.540]  Can you help me? Yeah, I'll do it.
[49:59.980 --> 50:02.000]  Let me plug this blue one in and then we're good.
[50:02.180 --> 50:03.780]  It's not like I'm not pulling on the door.
[50:04.140 --> 50:06.020]  Yeah, no, I see. Dude, that's a big
[50:06.020 --> 50:07.820]  old thing. Yep. There we go.
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.580]  Hey, Nick. You did it.
[50:09.760 --> 50:10.720]  Hey, I wasn't pulling on the door.
[50:11.940 --> 50:13.700]  You want to be blue or red? I'll be blue.
[50:14.360 --> 50:16.060]  Alright, I got this thing charged.
[50:16.380 --> 50:18.320]  Oh, good work. Oh, nice. I'll be right there, Geoff.
[50:19.060 --> 50:19.480]  Got it.
[50:21.500 --> 50:22.060]  There we go.
[50:22.220 --> 50:23.180]  Alright, we're rolling.
[50:24.680 --> 50:25.260]  I'm with you.
[50:25.560 --> 50:27.080]  Did you get that battery charge, Geoff?
[50:27.080 --> 50:28.400]  I think so, yeah.
[50:28.640 --> 50:31.220]  Drag it over and plug it in.
[50:32.180 --> 50:33.620]  Oh, do we need to bring the generator?
[50:35.060 --> 50:36.120]  Oh, I think we do.
[50:36.200 --> 50:36.660]  You want to drive?
[50:37.280 --> 50:37.780]  I'll try.
[50:38.900 --> 50:40.000]  You still over there, Geoff?
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.200]  I'm on my way. Why don't I steer and you do the pedals?
[50:44.560 --> 50:46.040]  Are you guys all past this or something?
[50:46.200 --> 50:47.260]  No, I'm with you.
[50:47.780 --> 50:49.280]  We're like two sections past this.
[50:50.580 --> 50:51.300]  There you go.
[50:52.420 --> 50:53.500]  There you go. Nice and easy.
[50:53.560 --> 50:55.480]  Nice and slow. How's that?
[50:56.800 --> 50:57.600]  Pretty good.
[50:57.980 --> 51:00.160]  Do we need to...
[51:00.160 --> 51:01.960]  We'll get that close.
[51:03.360 --> 51:04.640]  Alright, we got one plugged in.
[51:04.740 --> 51:05.980]  We put the other one in. We might be good.
[51:06.860 --> 51:07.540]  There we go.
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.360]  And then...
[51:09.360 --> 51:11.480]  Well, you've plugged in one of the wrong cables.
[51:11.720 --> 51:14.600]  You plugged in the red cable that's not plugged in.
[51:14.900 --> 51:15.420]  Hey, Gavin.
[51:16.280 --> 51:17.220]  There we go.
[51:17.280 --> 51:17.840]  I did it again.
[51:19.460 --> 51:21.040]  Nick's just skipping the whole game.
[51:23.520 --> 51:24.580]  Alright, we're not under a good...
[51:24.580 --> 51:25.980]  We're not forward enough.
[51:26.100 --> 51:26.700]  Oh, wait here.
[51:28.660 --> 51:29.700]  Hang on.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.300]  There we go, Geoff.
[51:32.980 --> 51:33.620]  Okay, there we go.
[51:34.120 --> 51:35.200]  Now that should do it.
[51:37.600 --> 51:38.900]  Oh my god.
[51:38.960 --> 51:39.560]  It's still not?
[51:41.480 --> 51:43.240]  I don't think that's it.
[51:43.600 --> 51:44.040]  Okay, go up.
[51:44.720 --> 51:45.040]  Go up?
[51:46.260 --> 51:46.700]  Okay.
[51:47.820 --> 51:49.520]  I think it's tilting it.
[51:51.320 --> 51:52.980]  It's not going.
[51:52.980 --> 51:54.020]  It's not going.
[51:54.480 --> 51:55.140]  Hey, guys.
[51:56.320 --> 51:57.640]  Why is it not going?
[51:58.700 --> 52:01.320]  Well, you gotta plug the thing in.
[52:01.700 --> 52:02.440]  Unplug it, maybe?
[52:04.500 --> 52:04.640]  Here.
[52:04.940 --> 52:06.900]  Is it gonna close the gate? No. Okay, cool.
[52:07.260 --> 52:08.660]  There. You're free.
[52:10.240 --> 52:11.200]  I'm stuck.
[52:11.960 --> 52:13.680]  I think you're too close to the wall.
[52:14.060 --> 52:14.340]  Hold on.
[52:14.480 --> 52:15.660]  I got you.
[52:16.620 --> 52:17.280]  There you go.
[52:18.380 --> 52:19.960]  Keep going back.
[52:19.960 --> 52:21.560]  We'll help.
[52:22.680 --> 52:24.520]  Alright, and then we'll...
[52:24.520 --> 52:24.980]  Do one of these?
[52:25.220 --> 52:28.580]  And then go...
[52:29.080 --> 52:29.560]  Forward!
[52:30.260 --> 52:32.920]  Forward to the right!
[52:33.500 --> 52:36.120]  Right! That's left.
[52:36.640 --> 52:37.560]  That's left.
[52:38.100 --> 52:39.420]  There you go. Right.
[52:39.720 --> 52:41.100]  More right. All the way right.
[52:42.220 --> 52:43.260]  As right as it can go.
[52:43.440 --> 52:45.360]  There you go.
[52:45.760 --> 52:46.500]  Keep it going, boys.
[52:46.500 --> 52:46.920]  Uh-oh.
[52:49.880 --> 52:51.080]  We're almost there.
[52:51.320 --> 52:53.100]  We're almost there. We're so close.
[52:53.420 --> 52:53.960]  Why'd you go backwards?
[52:55.660 --> 52:57.280]  Geoff, let go!
[52:57.700 --> 52:58.240]  Alright, I got it.
[52:59.420 --> 53:00.020]  I had to jump.
[53:01.540 --> 53:02.440]  Straighten her out.
[53:04.240 --> 53:04.680]  Left!
[53:05.360 --> 53:06.740]  What are you doing, Gavin?
[53:07.000 --> 53:07.280]  Left!
[53:09.520 --> 53:10.120]  Left!
[53:12.040 --> 53:13.240]  These cables...
[53:13.240 --> 53:15.880]  These cables are perfectly fine.
[53:15.880 --> 53:17.640]  Guys, we're fine.
[53:19.080 --> 53:20.400]  You need to back it up.
[53:20.480 --> 53:21.580]  We can't get to the...
[53:22.180 --> 53:23.300]  cable prongs.
[53:23.660 --> 53:24.640]  That's good. Stop.
[53:25.680 --> 53:27.440]  You need cables? I got cables.
[53:27.620 --> 53:28.980]  I got cables.
[53:29.280 --> 53:29.700]  I'm coming.
[53:30.760 --> 53:32.840]  I got the long cables.
[53:33.720 --> 53:36.380]  Go back up. Back up a little bit.
[53:42.640 --> 53:43.460]  Back up.
[53:44.940 --> 53:45.960]  Way to go, man.
[53:46.500 --> 53:46.940]  Cool.
[53:47.900 --> 53:49.980]  You took this thing off.
[53:50.080 --> 53:51.000]  We cannot connect it.
[53:51.300 --> 53:51.680]  What do you mean?
[53:53.920 --> 53:55.820]  You've blocked the whole thing.
[53:56.160 --> 53:56.880]  Guys, I got a battery.
[53:57.480 --> 53:58.220]  Oh, shit.
[53:59.260 --> 54:01.080]  Do you think we can lift it all together?
[54:02.340 --> 54:03.420]  It's a five-man lift.
[54:03.940 --> 54:04.660]  There we go. We got it.
[54:06.080 --> 54:08.200]  We didn't even need the damn forklift.
[54:09.420 --> 54:09.860]  Well, don't worry.
[54:09.920 --> 54:10.920]  Andrew's getting some cables.
[54:10.940 --> 54:11.660]  I got a battery.
[54:11.660 --> 54:13.140]  Oh, sorry.
[54:14.360 --> 54:15.580]  What are we trying to do here?
[54:17.880 --> 54:18.300]  Excuse me.
[54:18.340 --> 54:18.820]  Eric?
[54:19.920 --> 54:20.260]  Excuse me.
[54:20.880 --> 54:21.680]  Got it.
[54:22.560 --> 54:24.620]  What are you fools trying to do?
[54:25.100 --> 54:27.480]  I'm getting Geoff away from this thing.
[54:27.840 --> 54:29.900]  I don't want him anywhere near this.
[54:30.340 --> 54:31.260]  Why do we need this plug?
[54:32.420 --> 54:33.640]  Alright, now start it.
[54:33.920 --> 54:34.500]  Now start it.
[54:37.880 --> 54:39.120]  Did you pull it?
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.020]  Keep going.
[54:40.200 --> 54:42.200]  You got it.
[54:42.380 --> 54:45.460]  And then you want to...
[54:46.160 --> 54:46.920]  Yank it.
[54:47.420 --> 54:48.260]  I'm yanking.
[54:48.880 --> 54:49.900]  Alright, let's both yank it.
[54:50.360 --> 54:50.880]  Power.
[54:51.860 --> 54:52.420]  Gate.
[54:54.760 --> 54:55.360]  We lost power.
[54:56.500 --> 54:57.660]  I got it.
[54:58.100 --> 54:59.000]  I got it.
[55:00.220 --> 55:02.380]  Why are you even touching the wires?
[55:02.440 --> 55:04.140]  Maybe the gate is a five-man lift.
[55:05.700 --> 55:06.200]  Yes.
[55:10.940 --> 55:12.280]  Get the battery in.
[55:13.800 --> 55:14.880]  Andrew's battery.
[55:15.860 --> 55:16.900]  Somebody on the other side.
[55:18.120 --> 55:18.380]  Wait.
[55:18.720 --> 55:19.060]  Lift.
[55:20.580 --> 55:22.920]  A little more to that thought, Nick.
[55:23.160 --> 55:23.760]  I'm not strong enough.
[55:23.780 --> 55:25.040]  What happened?
[55:26.240 --> 55:27.520]  You said wait.
[55:27.980 --> 55:28.420]  I did?
[55:29.200 --> 55:29.960]  Oh my god.
[55:32.810 --> 55:34.360]  I don't recall that.
[55:34.880 --> 55:35.400]  There you go.
[55:36.300 --> 55:38.640]  Help us with the battery.
[55:38.640 --> 55:40.140]  There you go.
[55:40.640 --> 55:42.300]  There you go.
[55:42.360 --> 55:43.180]  Geoff, lift.
[55:43.720 --> 55:46.040]  Put the battery in.
[55:46.820 --> 55:47.660]  I'm trying.
[55:48.200 --> 55:50.020]  I'll come help lift.
[55:50.980 --> 55:51.500]  I got you.
[55:52.220 --> 55:53.700]  It's crushing my chin.
[55:54.440 --> 55:55.600]  You got to go the other way.
[55:57.040 --> 55:57.620]  There.
[55:58.800 --> 55:59.640]  Other way.
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.140]  Go. It's under it.
[56:02.220 --> 56:03.360]  Just push.
[56:04.920 --> 56:06.040]  We'll grab it from you.
[56:08.060 --> 56:08.740]  Pull it.
[56:08.820 --> 56:09.540]  That's me.
[56:10.540 --> 56:11.660]  What's up, Geoff?
[56:12.660 --> 56:12.880]  Pull.
[56:14.740 --> 56:15.500]  We did it.
[56:15.520 --> 56:16.760]  We did it.
[56:16.900 --> 56:20.420]  Go grab the box.
[56:20.800 --> 56:22.660]  I'm going to go get this box.
[56:23.160 --> 56:23.500]  Me too.
[56:23.600 --> 56:24.800]  We don't need it.
[56:26.180 --> 56:26.700]  Okay, cool.
[56:31.180 --> 56:31.660]  Andrew.
[56:32.320 --> 56:33.440]  What does this one do?
[56:33.440 --> 56:34.640]  What does this one do?
[56:35.880 --> 56:36.120]  Guys.
[56:38.020 --> 56:39.220]  I got a box.
[56:39.720 --> 56:40.620]  Way to go, dude.
[56:41.160 --> 56:42.340]  Enjoy your time over there.
[56:43.560 --> 56:44.780]  Geoff, what's on the other side of the door?
[56:45.580 --> 56:46.060]  A lever.
[56:47.540 --> 56:48.160]  Pull the lever.
[56:48.880 --> 56:50.440]  I'm trying to push the lever.
[56:50.540 --> 56:50.620]  No!
[56:53.820 --> 56:55.440]  Just wanted to make sure you really wanted it.
[56:56.540 --> 56:57.980]  Might be a two-person lever.
[56:58.380 --> 56:58.860]  I got you.
[56:59.420 --> 57:00.600]  How are these cables working for you, Andrew?
[57:01.880 --> 57:03.020]  Nobody's respecting the battery.
[57:03.020 --> 57:03.980]  I think the battery's the key.
[57:04.100 --> 57:05.940]  I think we're moving it.
[57:06.640 --> 57:08.280]  Yeah, we're just moving that thing left and right.
[57:08.520 --> 57:10.300]  Are we connecting this to the power lines?
[57:10.780 --> 57:12.240]  Here, let me go look at the other side.
[57:12.820 --> 57:13.100]  Put it in.
[57:14.220 --> 57:14.760]  I'm trying.
[57:17.480 --> 57:18.040]  Come on.
[57:18.120 --> 57:19.200]  Is this like a secret gate room?
[57:19.280 --> 57:19.900]  I think so.
[57:22.940 --> 57:23.560]  There we go.
[57:24.700 --> 57:25.060]  Whoa.
[57:25.560 --> 57:25.920]  Cool.
[57:28.100 --> 57:28.540]  Whoa!
[57:29.880 --> 57:30.880]  What is this?
[57:36.740 --> 57:37.760]  Oh, I found a house.
[57:38.520 --> 57:38.960]  No!
[57:40.760 --> 57:41.560]  Oh, nice.
[57:42.140 --> 57:43.160]  Whoa, cool.
[57:44.120 --> 57:45.060]  If you close this...
[57:45.060 --> 57:46.540]  Oh, God, are you going to cook me?
[57:49.760 --> 57:50.940]  Turn it on!
[57:52.780 --> 57:54.060]  Eric, turn it on!
[57:54.480 --> 57:55.400]  I don't know how...
[57:55.400 --> 57:56.380]  Oh, can we?
[57:57.900 --> 57:59.480]  Is there a lever over here?
[58:01.620 --> 58:03.560]  No, I don't see anything to turn it on.
[58:03.840 --> 58:03.880]  Damn.
[58:10.080 --> 58:12.220]  Alright, should we load this bad boy up with coal?
[58:12.680 --> 58:14.280]  That's what it looks like we have to do,
[58:14.380 --> 58:16.460]  but I don't think we're tall enough to do it.
[58:16.580 --> 58:17.720]  Well, you've got to tip the thing down.
[58:18.360 --> 58:19.700]  Oh, that makes sense.
[58:21.780 --> 58:22.920]  Oh, you're moving it backwards.
[58:23.440 --> 58:24.400]  Oh, you're moving it backwards.
[58:24.680 --> 58:25.580]  Someone's driving it.
[58:25.600 --> 58:27.380]  Not sure why you're moving it backwards.
[58:27.380 --> 58:29.600]  Just has to tip down.
[58:29.820 --> 58:32.180]  Who's driving it?
[58:32.340 --> 58:33.460]  Stop making it go backwards.
[58:33.920 --> 58:36.540]  Just stop moving it all together
[58:36.540 --> 58:39.000]  and just dip the back down.
[58:39.320 --> 58:40.200]  That's all you have to do.
[58:40.260 --> 58:41.540]  You just make the back go down.
[58:41.960 --> 58:44.020]  You don't have to make it go forward or anything.
[58:44.220 --> 58:44.880]  Who's driving it?
[58:45.580 --> 58:46.900]  Andrew, what do you mean, who?
[58:47.060 --> 58:48.520]  It's Andrew, of course it's Andrew.
[58:51.740 --> 58:55.480]  I'm getting squished.
[58:56.660 --> 58:57.020]  Oh!
[59:00.040 --> 59:01.180]  I'm a stowaway.
[59:02.480 --> 59:04.540]  Andrew, I can't help but notice that we don't have the coal.
[59:05.520 --> 59:06.040]  Trip turn!
[59:09.020 --> 59:10.260]  Brake, brake, brake!
[59:11.180 --> 59:12.940]  Eric, can you just bring the coal on foot?
[59:13.700 --> 59:14.380]  No, I'm good.
[59:14.600 --> 59:14.820]  Okay.
[59:16.140 --> 59:18.740]  So we need to just walk all the way up the street?
[59:19.240 --> 59:20.080]  Well, there was a car.
[59:20.900 --> 59:22.720]  Yeah, there was a car. Andrew just took it.
[59:23.260 --> 59:24.760]  Andrew went single player mode and took the car.
[59:24.760 --> 59:26.520]  I'm doing what we're supposed to do.
[59:26.680 --> 59:27.860]  Yeah, he's putting coal in, actually.
[59:28.220 --> 59:31.620]  Doing what we're supposed to do.
[59:31.660 --> 59:33.040]  Oh, I tell you what, there's a second car.
[59:33.120 --> 59:34.160]  I can come and pick you guys up.
[59:34.660 --> 59:35.140]  Oh, hell yeah.
[59:36.020 --> 59:37.440]  I'm already up here, but yeah, man.
[59:41.860 --> 59:43.560]  I mean, I'll ride with you if you want.
[59:44.140 --> 59:45.520]  You want me to go forward and stuff?
[59:45.700 --> 59:46.660]  Yeah, where's Geoff?
[59:47.540 --> 59:48.540]  He's down there, I think.
[59:49.220 --> 59:50.420]  Alright, let's go and get Geoff.
[59:51.080 --> 59:52.540]  That certainly is enough coal.
[59:52.540 --> 59:55.020]  There's no way we need all of it.
[59:55.220 --> 59:55.620]  Sure.
[59:56.060 --> 59:58.060]  Okay, now reverse.
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.040]  Oh, dude, we're doing good.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.780]  You kidding me? We're fucking killing it right here.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.300]  Ready, and...
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.460]  Cut it right. Here we go.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.220]  Dude, is this what driving a real car is like?
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.880]  Yeah, when you have someone on your team...
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.660]  Yo, what's up, man?
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.280]  We died.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.500]  Go left.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.500]  There you go.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.140]  Andrew dispensed himself.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.020]  Yep.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.500]  Where are we going?
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.160]  We're doing a jump.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.240]  Okay.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.480]  I'll help you, Geoff.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.080]  You want to cut it a little left?
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.600]  Well, yeah.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:38.940]  Yeah, you got it.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:40.840]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.640]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:43.900]  Geoff?
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:44.960]  Geoff?
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.340]  I don't like the way that you steered the car.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.380]  Oh, no, I pulled a thing!
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.660]  That's right.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.960]  Oh, my God, Geoff.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.120]  Gavin, you monster!
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.600]  Look at that!
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.880]  He's so funny jumping up.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.580]  Oh, no!
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.980]  Eric's bloody stupid car!
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:11.260]  I'm in hell!
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.800]  Who did that?
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.860]  Who did that?
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.460]  That was Eric.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.900]  I can't believe he did that.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.700]  Who's driving the other car?
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.380]  I'm not moving it!
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.740]  It's coming this way!
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.960]  Is that driving itself?
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:39.340]  Gavin, drive me off the edge!
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.080]  Eric really messed everything up.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.740]  Gavin, kill me!
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.460]  Kill me!
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.340]  Fuck!
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.640]  Eric's stuck through the front!
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.080]  Kill me!
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.160]  Eric's a part of the car!
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:54.980]  Kill me!
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.180]  Where are we going here, Andrew?
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.400]  Let's grab two at a time.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.380]  I'm free!
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:01.500]  Oh, I'm with Nick.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.560]  Should we get more coal?
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.180]  I had all the coal!
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.660]  Why did you dump it?
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.420]  You dumped it!
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.520]  I didn't do anything! I wasn't in your car, dipshit!
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.380]  Geoff, come on!
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.620]  Geoff!
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:17.540]  Oh, that was your fault then.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320]  Wait, Gavin did it?
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.700]  Yeah, Gavin did it.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.660]  Who dumped the coal?
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.640]  I landed inside the windshield.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.040]  Which is next to the switch.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.240]  Yeah, your body hit the thing.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.380]  And then it dumped the coal.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.260]  Yeah, it's because Gavin drove me off the edge.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.320]  Blame is complicated.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.100]  There's a lot of different blamage.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.040]  I think mostly it's on Gavin.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.040]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.720]  Alright, so how do we get this coal?
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.400]  Just drop it in, right?
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.640]  Oh, it didn't respawn.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.220]  How do you park, damn it?
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.460]  Damn it? How do you park, damn it?
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.500]  I've driven one kilometer.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.820]  I'm on one foot! What's happening?
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.920]  I wonder how long it would take us to move
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.500]  one piece of coal
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.320]  at a time, manually.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.320]  I think we need to knock all the coal off
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.680]  and it will respawn in the car.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.760]  I don't think it will.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120]  Help me build this coal.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.200]  No, you want the coal in here.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.440]  Gavin, we need that coal. I'm putting it in.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.420]  In where?
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.280]  In the...
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.720]  What do you mean? It's in the...
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.440]  What are you talking about?
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.400]  The coal that's all over the road.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.380]  I'm respawning it on the treadmill.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.620]  No, that's me putting it on the treadmill.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.280]  No, no, no, the coal
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.840]  that got dumped out the first time
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.460]  is respawned on the road now.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:44.980]  Perfect.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.380]  I don't know, it was not here
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.860]  a little bit ago. How weird.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.040]  Whoever's throwing coal away
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.040]  is making it appear
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040]  in the back of this truck.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.700]  No, that's me!
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.840]  No, that's Gavin.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.900]  Nick is on the other side of the conveyor belt
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.020]  putting coal in.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.060]  Isn't he taking coal from the respawning coal?
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.380]  No, it's not respawning!
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.640]  What Gavin is doing
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.840]  has nothing to do with the coal that we need.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.420]  He's just doing this
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.420]  and he's Gavin trying
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.600]  to take credit for something he didn't think of
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.360]  like the 20,000 things dream.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.600]  These two morons are just
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.120]  going, yeah, Gavin's doing it.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.400]  I just started throwing it off and then I
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.280]  saw coal on the conveyor belt.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.660]  I'm over here grabbing coal like my life depends on it.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.260]  Oh, he's respawning!
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.840]  I'm unintentionally putting
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.020]  motivation into Nick to get more coal.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.480]  Oh my god.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.540]  Yeah, that's what you're doing.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.560]  Oh, that one respawned.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.360]  Do you think that's enough coal?
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.500]  It's two, three...
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.680]  Andrew wandered over to where the coal thing is.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:50.320]  Nine, ten.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.580]  Yeah, I'm out.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.600]  So you need me to respawn this coal?
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:55.480]  Try it.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:00.100]  He doesn't have
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.260]  any more that he can load.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.640]  There's a couple left.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.420]  So surely when I throw
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.700]  this coal off, right? Throw it, let's see!
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.540]  Does it put it back to you?
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.920]  Let's find out, throw it.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.500]  I did. Okay, no, two pieces of coal just
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.620]  fell on me. Gavin throws
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.480]  coal, coal falls on me. No, that's
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.320]  me! That's more Gavin coal.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:20.920]  Thanks, Gavin.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.260]  Oh wait, that one just respawned.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.100]  Yeah, it's because I'm throwing it all off.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.540]  One respawned, Gavin! You threw like
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.180]  eight pieces! Geoff, you wanna
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.820]  use the wheel or you wanna drive forward
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.900]  backward? Alright, what if I throw these two pieces
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.980]  off me? Try it, try it, try it.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.460]  Drive forward backward, you steer.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.400]  Did you do it? No.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.980]  Okay, do it. Okay, I'm taking
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.580]  two coals. Okay. Damn it.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.320]  They're heavy coals. Hold on.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.940]  Hold on. Alright, I got
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.500]  two coals. Bind.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:51.480]  Okay.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.780]  We're done with the coal, guys.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.000]  You guys keep arguing though, it's fun.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.340]  Yeah. Other way, other way.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.800]  Oh god, I'm just trying to-
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.340]  Look, there's two coals, they came back! No, it's
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:03.960]  me!
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.440]  Let me know when you're going backwards.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.900]  Alright, I'm gonna go backwards now.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.920]  So it didn't make two new coals for you?
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:14.980]  No, it did not.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.000]  We're stuck on something.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.060]  Here we go.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.340]  Gavin. Alright, let's try to go
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.360]  backwards now. It was me.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.960]  Which way do you want me to throw it?
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.080]  Wait, wait, wait, you're going but I'm not able to-
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:28.640]  I'm not turning.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.760]  You guys need help with the steering wheel?
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.000]  Careful, guys.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.660]  Okay, and now go backward.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:36.740]  Okay.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.800]  And then...
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:40.380]  Stop.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.500]  And now go forward.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:45.540]  And...
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:46.740]  Stop.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.820]  Now go backward.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:54.620]  And...
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:55.560]  Careful.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.240]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.820]  I didn't say to go forward!
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.620]  I didn't say to go forward!
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.780]  Why'd you do it?
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:02.860]  No!
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.440]  No!
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.440]  Geoff!
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.120]  That was going so well!
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.860]  Why did you do that?
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.900]  I lost the key.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.560]  The knob that I could get back to.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.860]  He set up his camera.
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.760]  So where's all the coal then?
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.340]  Oh, you need to refill it with coal?
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.740]  Gav, you better start shoveling it.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:29.760]  Off the side.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.880]  There'll never be enough.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.100]  Where's all the coal, Nick?
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.200]  It's in there. It's right here.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.620]  There was a ton of it before.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.880]  Why do we have music now?
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.840]  So that'll come back?
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.520]  Not all of it, some of it.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.300]  There was a lot more than this.
[01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.290]  I wish that had gone now.
[01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.750]  I agree.
[01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:53.990]  Go forward just a little bit.
[01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:54.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.870]  Hey, but now we're not going to have to Austin Powers at this time.
[01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.810]  It's facing my direction.
[01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.110]  I thought we were doing such a good job
[01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.090]  going forward and backward and then it was just like
[01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:05.030]  you just started going.
[01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.210]  It got away from me.
[01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:08.230]  It looks amazing.
[01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:11.810]  I'll be honest, I think the
[01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:12.950]  What the fuck?
[01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:15.850]  I think the gear shift was
[01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:17.930]  honestly, I think it was a little
[01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:19.950]  I think it was sabotage. I think it was extra slippery.
[01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:23.650]  Okay, who do you think did it?
[01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.690]  I don't know.
[01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:28.250]  I want you to know I'm on the case.
[01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:29.210]  Oh, good.
[01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:32.470]  Did the log on fire?
[01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:32.930]  Yeah.
[01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:36.430]  The log is on fire
[01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:37.310]  and it's with the coal.
[01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:39.550]  Ow, ow, ow.
[01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.990]  I'm getting all gummed in.
[01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:43.690]  Oh, hey, what's up, Nick?
[01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.850]  Hey, what's up, Gavin?
[01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:47.130]  Hey, Gavin, thanks for all that coal, man.
[01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:48.190]  You always deliver.
[01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:51.850]  Guys, can you pull me down?
[01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:53.530]  Nick, can you pull me down?
[01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:55.150]  Oh, hey, what's up, Gavin?
[01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.930]  Nah, he's good.
[01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:58.950]  We just need some more coal.
[01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:01.030]  That's it. That's all the coal there is.
[01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:02.170]  That's it?
[01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:04.290]  Most of it was in the truck.
[01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:07.030]  Oh, that can't be enough.
[01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:08.230]  That's it.
[01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:09.770]  Alright, Geoff, you want to go forward?
[01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:12.090]  Yeah, I don't want to steer.
[01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:14.790]  Grab the truck with one arm and grab me with the other.
[01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:15.310]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:17.470]  Are we ready?
[01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:19.350]  No, no, no, wait.
[01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:21.730]  We got to pull me free.
[01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:24.010]  Wait, guys, no!
[01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:25.270]  No!
[01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:27.710]  Well, Gavin.
[01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:29.750]  Did you hear something, Eric?
[01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:33.330]  Maybe it was the screams of the coal,
[01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:34.290]  but I don't think so.
[01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:34.750]  Yeah.
[01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:36.990]  I got one going.
[01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:38.930]  Look, there's Andrew.
[01:09:39.610 --> 01:09:41.770]  Come here! Over here!
[01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:43.370]  Did we see you?
[01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:45.170]  I think you're going to want to cut it a little bit.
[01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.970]  I'm trying.
[01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:50.030]  I'm just trying to take the corner nice and easy.
[01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.210]  I appreciate the effort, Nick.
[01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:51.850]  I'm trying!
[01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:54.550]  Oh, no, we're stuck.
[01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:56.390]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.690]  If only you had two other people to help you with that other truck.
[01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:01.830]  I'm waving them in.
[01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.490]  The other truck is the issue.
[01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:05.110]  Gavin is perma-trapped.
[01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:08.190]  I'm crotch-locked.
[01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:09.190]  Nick, go on without me.
[01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:11.430]  I can't leave you here, Gavin. Not like this.
[01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:14.010]  Do you think the ODSTs had crotch-lock?
[01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.150]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:19.330]  Over the side!
[01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:22.010]  Geoff's fighting the tires.
[01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:22.550]  Yeah.
[01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:25.790]  I wanted to get a closer inspection to make sure the tread was looking good.
[01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:28.350]  You got to do maintenance on these vehicles.
[01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:29.170]  Oh, come on.
[01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:30.650]  Hard turn, hard turn right.
[01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:32.590]  Come on.
[01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:33.530]  There we go.
[01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.890]  Surely you will be free.
[01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.850]  Oh, we're going to be driving into the mist.
[01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:43.830]  Watch out for bugs.
[01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:45.930]  It's this way.
[01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:47.530]  We're coming, Andrew.
[01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.450]  It's this way.
[01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.950]  Andrew looks like a zombie.
[01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:51.430]  Kick him.
[01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:57.190]  Let go.
[01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:57.930]  You're good.
[01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:59.970]  I'm getting extra speed.
[01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:02.650]  Whatever happened to Nick and Gavin?
[01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:05.390]  I don't know. Honestly, who cares?
[01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.970]  Swing.
[01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:09.730]  Where do we go?
[01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:13.190]  I think we have to put the coal...
[01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:13.870]  Okay.
[01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:17.230]  Alright, straight on till morning, Geoff.
[01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:18.090]  Keep it going.
[01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:19.750]  Doing great.
[01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.870]  Slow and steady.
[01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:24.670]  Geoff, this is a great team-up.
[01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:25.790]  We're actually doing a really great job.
[01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.730]  And we just got a checkpoint.
[01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:36.590]  And we get our union mandated break here in a few minutes.
[01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:37.150]  That's right.
[01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:38.630]  Should I stop?
[01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:42.850]  I'm just going to move it a little bit off to the side here.
[01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:47.850]  I'm just going to move this off to the side.
[01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:49.130]  Like this.
[01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:51.410]  Why are you going backwards?
[01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:52.790]  I didn't mean to go backwards.
[01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:54.090]  I was just trying to stop it.
[01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:56.370]  If we're good here, we're good.
[01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:57.850]  Someone get corporate on the line!
[01:11:58.530 --> 01:11:59.090]  Let's dump it.
[01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:02.570]  Here it comes.
[01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.450]  Are your balls stuck in there?
[01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.250]  Yeah.
[01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:09.290]  The representative should be here soon.
[01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:11.750]  Now, what are we loading in?
[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:13.630]  We're just throwing coal in?
[01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:14.630]  Yeah, that one's done.
[01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:15.490]  That first one's done.
[01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:18.110]  Oh, it's just the middle one? That's it?
[01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:20.170]  I think, and the third one as well.
[01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.910]  Oh, okay.
[01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:22.630]  How many pieces of coal do we need?
[01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:23.690]  Not sure.
[01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.390]  Does the fire just start?
[01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:29.270]  You have to walk the torch in and then it'll ignite.
[01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:31.810]  Got it.
[01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:37.590]  There's at least two pieces in the middle one.
[01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.250]  Yeah, let's walk the torch into the middle one.
[01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:41.330]  Geoff, put that in the last one.
[01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:42.070]  I'll do it in the last one.
[01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:45.530]  I was going to say Gavin, but he's not here to help.
[01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:48.810]  Okay, we got five coal in the middle one.
[01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:48.910]  Oh, sorry.
[01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.950]  Oh, you're free!
[01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:54.650]  You did it!
[01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.470]  Wow!
[01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.450]  Okay, that one's good.
[01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:01.650]  Gavin?
[01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.730]  Mm-hmm?
[01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:07.650]  Is he eating a sandwich?
[01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:08.950]  He's playing GTA.
[01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.870]  I was blocked to the coal chute, so I just started eating a sandwich that was here.
[01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:14.650]  I told you, he's eating a sandwich!
[01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:15.290]  We need more.
[01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.290]  I wish I'd had a sandwich.
[01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:20.570]  Thank you.
[01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:21.070]  There you go.
[01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:24.390]  Alright, you pop that bad boy in, we're going to be set.
[01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:25.810]  I think that'll probably be enough.
[01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:28.730]  Take us all the way to the tippy top.
[01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:29.570]  Oh shit, Nick!
[01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.110]  Not quite, not quite.
[01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:34.470]  Can you guys bring a little bit of coal down with you?
[01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:35.750]  Oh wait, we can just die!
[01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:38.030]  Wait, what?
[01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:39.670]  We don't have enough?
[01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.730]  Bad news, fellas.
[01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:44.090]  Here we are.
[01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.450]  Oh.
[01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:47.510]  Woah, woah, woah, sorry, I didn't realize I was in your way.
[01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:48.350]  Woah, woah, woah, stop the clock.
[01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:49.410]  Woah, woah, woah.
[01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:52.430]  T-O-P-L-E-S-S.
[01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:53.790]  There we go.
[01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:55.950]  You'll do it.
[01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:58.590]  Yeah, she'll do it.
[01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:00.950]  Oh wow, it's over here.
[01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:03.590]  Look at that!
[01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:04.170]  Wow!
[01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:07.850]  It turned on this fan?
[01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:09.930]  Do you think that was a world first?
[01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:11.070]  Hell yeah.
[01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.990]  I don't know that anybody's done this level.
[01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:14.210]  Yeah, it might just be us.
[01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.930]  Where are we supposed to...
[01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:20.170]  Oh shit!
[01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:21.370]  Eric, pull up my head!
[01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.910]  Okay, you got it.
[01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.630]  Can the next person that comes yak me up?
[01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:28.330]  Oh my god.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.580]  Andrew, where you at?
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:35.960]  I'm at the back.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:36.940]  I got knocked off.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:39.740]  I'm going!
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.000]  No, I'm not.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.000]  Yes, I am.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.860]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.480]  We did it!
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.420]  Yeah, we did it!
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.660]  Why is that a crotch full of Gavin in my face?
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.440]  Way to go, boys!
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:54.600]  Congratulations.
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.460]  Was that water?
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.020]  Or dark?
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.060]  That was water and factory.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:01.860]  What?
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.200]  Gavin, take us out.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.320]  He took a bite.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:08.740]  Bye, everyone!
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.500]  No, do the whole outro.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.740]  You know, all the stuff you gotta say.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.180]  Come on!
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:16.820]  You do it.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.580]  No, you do it.
