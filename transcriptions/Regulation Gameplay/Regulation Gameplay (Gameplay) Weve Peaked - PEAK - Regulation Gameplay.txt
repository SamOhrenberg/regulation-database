[00:00.000 --> 00:04.780]  Hey, what's going on, guys? I invited you all to my airport because I want to go on vacation with you.
[00:05.020 --> 00:11.100]  Uh, I thought it would be a lot of fun to hang out and climb and get on a beautiful jet.
[00:11.380 --> 00:13.880]  Geoff, take us away to a beautiful vacation.
[00:16.480 --> 00:16.960]  Geoff?
[00:19.500 --> 00:19.980]  Geoff?
[00:21.260 --> 00:22.160]  Hey, what's up?
[00:22.920 --> 00:23.880]  Beautiful vacation.
[00:24.940 --> 00:27.320]  What the f- what the f- what happened?
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.500]  I yet to figure out sound in the lighting screen.
[00:31.420 --> 00:32.140]  What happened?
[00:33.400 --> 00:35.460]  Well, we started and we didn't hear anything.
[00:35.520 --> 00:37.720]  So it came back and you're like, and this is a beautiful island!
[00:37.960 --> 00:40.060]  Yeah, I was- I was inviting you, guys.
[00:40.280 --> 00:42.100]  Uh, have no idea what we're doing.
[00:42.700 --> 00:43.920]  Let's find out together.
[00:44.700 --> 00:48.760]  Uh, it appears that we have a stamina bar in the lower left.
[00:50.260 --> 00:50.660]  Fellas.
[00:51.560 --> 00:52.960]  Some- somebody come grab this, uh...
[00:52.960 --> 00:53.660]  Geoff, what are you doing with that?
[00:53.840 --> 00:56.440]  You might- you might use that a little bit early, buddy.
[00:56.820 --> 00:57.180]  Help!
[00:59.060 --> 01:00.160]  We might die here.
[01:00.580 --> 01:02.200]  Let's spell H-L-E-P.
[01:02.380 --> 01:02.860]  H-L-E-P.
[01:02.860 --> 01:04.220]  Who wants to grab the trail mix?
[01:04.220 --> 01:05.380]  Hey, who likes to read?
[01:05.700 --> 01:06.040]  Fellas?
[01:06.560 --> 01:07.360]  Nick loves reading.
[01:07.760 --> 01:08.520]  I love trail mix.
[01:08.760 --> 01:10.380]  Oh yeah, Nick, you're 17th in your class.
[01:10.480 --> 01:10.780]  I was.
[01:12.460 --> 01:12.820]  Okay.
[01:13.660 --> 01:14.020]  Don't.
[01:14.820 --> 01:15.960]  How not to die.
[01:16.300 --> 01:17.320]  Oh wait, this is how to not die.
[01:17.540 --> 01:18.600]  Oh wait, this is how to not die.
[01:19.440 --> 01:19.800]  Uh...
[01:19.800 --> 01:21.100]  Oh Christ, you can't read.
[01:21.860 --> 01:23.100]  That's all right, I got it. Hold on.
[01:23.640 --> 01:24.520]  How do you flip pages?
[01:24.940 --> 01:25.900]  Yeah, Eric, go long.
[01:25.900 --> 01:26.500]  Okay.
[01:28.660 --> 01:29.020]  Whoa.
[01:29.860 --> 01:32.440]  The word sure just appeared on my screen as you threw it.
[01:34.280 --> 01:35.040]  Are you sure?
[01:35.760 --> 01:36.700]  Oh shit, sure!
[01:38.640 --> 01:40.060]  How do I flip the page?
[01:40.180 --> 01:41.120]  Let me put the- oh, there we go.
[01:41.420 --> 01:41.600]  Sure.
[01:42.060 --> 01:43.340]  I bet it's the mouse wheel.
[01:43.500 --> 01:45.680]  Oh yeah, but it was up, not down, which is not what I expected.
[01:46.680 --> 01:49.800]  Ooh, Gavin, do you think you can knock out one of these mangoes or coconuts or whatever?
[01:50.320 --> 01:53.940]  Time is of the essence in your wilderness, so get running towards your destination.
[01:55.460 --> 01:56.260]  What's our destination?
[01:56.780 --> 02:00.940]  Uh, looks like- first things first, you've got to get to high ground if you want to be spotted.
[02:01.100 --> 02:05.060]  Nobody ever got rescued off of Mysterious Island by loitering around on the beach to find the nearest-
[02:05.060 --> 02:05.920]  It's pretty high, high ground.
[02:05.940 --> 02:06.500]  High ground.
[02:06.940 --> 02:07.300]  Ow!
[02:07.380 --> 02:07.880]  Oh God!
[02:09.320 --> 02:12.920]  Oh, and never abandon a friend in need, says Scoutmaster Myers.
[02:15.180 --> 02:16.240]  Keep moving up.
[02:17.780 --> 02:18.360]  I, uh, yeah.
[02:18.400 --> 02:18.560]  Oh.
[02:18.840 --> 02:19.200]  Me too.
[02:19.420 --> 02:20.480]  We should all probably read this.
[02:20.680 --> 02:21.400]  I'm not reading shit.
[02:21.500 --> 02:21.560]  Why?
[02:21.640 --> 02:23.340]  My dad couldn't make me read. What makes you think you can?
[02:23.340 --> 02:25.200]  Why don't you read it to us like an audiobook?
[02:26.240 --> 02:30.660]  All right, see a gap in the trail or a prickly thorn, go ahead and jump over it.
[02:30.840 --> 02:31.820]  Space bar is jump.
[02:32.120 --> 02:35.160]  Keep in mind that jumping while sprinting will tire you out quickly.
[02:35.500 --> 02:36.860]  Take a quick rest if you need to.
[02:37.040 --> 02:40.160]  You won't do anyone any favors by passing out on the mountain.
[02:40.620 --> 02:42.680]  Rule two, keep moving up.
[02:43.220 --> 02:46.580]  Obviously, you're not going to make it up a mountain without climbing.
[02:46.720 --> 02:46.880]  Touch that.
[02:47.020 --> 02:47.380]  Take two.
[02:47.760 --> 02:48.340]  No, touch that.
[02:48.660 --> 02:48.840]  Uh...
[02:48.840 --> 02:49.180]  Touch that.
[02:50.000 --> 02:51.980]  You can't climb almost any surface.
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.280]  I'm not gonna touch it.
[02:53.340 --> 02:54.360]  As long as you have stamina.
[02:54.820 --> 02:55.480]  Hold left.
[02:55.840 --> 02:56.580]  Left click.
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.160]  Empty handed to grab the wall.
[02:58.360 --> 03:00.020]  And then space in the air will grab the wall.
[03:09.700 --> 03:10.500]  I'm poisoned.
[03:11.080 --> 03:12.860]  I'm trying to read a goddamn book.
[03:16.320 --> 03:16.960]  What the fuck?
[03:17.020 --> 03:17.760]  That's not a book.
[03:17.940 --> 03:18.600]  Oh, that was crazy.
[03:19.120 --> 03:20.000]  Did you do this?
[03:20.740 --> 03:21.400]  No, it's just on the ground.
[03:21.400 --> 03:22.140]  That's a jellyfish.
[03:22.300 --> 03:22.860]  It's a jellyfish?
[03:22.860 --> 03:24.800]  How did it get this far inland?
[03:25.400 --> 03:25.800]  Tide.
[03:26.500 --> 03:27.040]  Yeah, tide.
[03:27.160 --> 03:27.920]  Oh, we should probably get moving.
[03:29.520 --> 03:30.600]  You were reading a book.
[03:30.760 --> 03:31.540]  I'm just hanging out.
[03:31.640 --> 03:34.640]  Oh, there's another, uh...
[03:38.210 --> 03:38.630]  Luggage.
[03:39.050 --> 03:40.670]  Fellas, just playing the trumpet.
[03:41.170 --> 03:44.670]  Oh, hey, I got a granola bar and bandages.
[03:44.870 --> 03:45.930]  I'll hang on to the bandages.
[03:46.590 --> 03:47.490]  I'll hold on to the granola bar.
[03:47.970 --> 03:48.270]  Cool.
[03:49.250 --> 03:49.490]  What?
[03:49.610 --> 03:50.590]  How did you get up there?
[03:51.390 --> 03:53.470]  Uh, come to the tree.
[03:53.810 --> 03:54.790]  You're gonna hurt yourself.
[03:55.950 --> 03:57.270]  She's rescuing the tree?
[03:58.650 --> 04:01.990]  You can climb it by jumping and then holding spacebar when you're up.
[04:02.590 --> 04:04.670]  And then you can leap, whip, shift.
[04:06.930 --> 04:07.330]  Interesting.
[04:07.510 --> 04:07.910]  Damn.
[04:08.990 --> 04:09.450]  We're learning.
[04:09.450 --> 04:10.570]  Damn, I'm gonna run out of stamina.
[04:11.470 --> 04:12.750]  Is it about to be nighttime?
[04:13.090 --> 04:13.970]  Oh, shit.
[04:14.250 --> 04:15.530]  That's when the zombies come out, probably.
[04:15.650 --> 04:16.110]  Oh, another suitcase.
[04:17.210 --> 04:18.470]  So do we have to just climb up that?
[04:18.570 --> 04:19.130]  That's easy.
[04:19.550 --> 04:19.570]  Oh, water.
[04:20.650 --> 04:23.030]  Oh, first aid kit.
[04:24.870 --> 04:25.910]  I've got bad tummy.
[04:25.910 --> 04:26.590]  How do I put it in my backpack?
[04:27.770 --> 04:28.350]  Are you hungry?
[04:28.650 --> 04:29.450]  You should get this trail mix.
[04:30.110 --> 04:30.950]  Pick up a bong.
[04:31.210 --> 04:31.630]  Bing bong.
[04:31.870 --> 04:32.270]  Bing bong.
[04:32.590 --> 04:33.070]  Bing bong.
[04:33.890 --> 04:34.490]  Bing bong.
[04:36.330 --> 04:37.050]  Bing bong.
[04:37.610 --> 04:38.190]  Oh, no.
[04:38.490 --> 04:38.770]  No.
[04:38.950 --> 04:39.610]  No bong!
[04:39.710 --> 04:40.230]  He got stuck up.
[04:40.250 --> 04:40.690]  He's out of here.
[04:41.830 --> 04:42.130]  Uh-oh.
[04:42.570 --> 04:44.090]  Who's got inventory space?
[04:44.410 --> 04:44.770]  I don't.
[04:44.870 --> 04:45.190]  You do.
[04:45.210 --> 04:45.690]  You have a backpack.
[04:46.250 --> 04:46.870]  You have a backpack.
[04:47.430 --> 04:47.770]  Oh, okay.
[04:47.770 --> 04:49.070]  And you've got more space than you had before.
[04:51.170 --> 04:52.290]  Am I the only one with a backpack?
[04:52.370 --> 04:52.850]  I think so.
[04:52.950 --> 04:53.010]  Yeah.
[04:53.010 --> 04:53.390]  Yeah.
[04:54.730 --> 04:55.990]  Did you find the backpack?
[04:56.670 --> 04:56.890]  Yeah.
[04:57.030 --> 04:57.550]  Oh, then, yeah.
[04:59.710 --> 05:03.010]  Well, look at you!
[05:03.650 --> 05:03.810]  Oh!
[05:04.610 --> 05:04.970]  Ouch.
[05:06.470 --> 05:07.390]  That's so neat.
[05:08.490 --> 05:09.830]  Oh, you landed on your butt on my screen.
[05:10.490 --> 05:12.050]  I can't do anything with it.
[05:12.270 --> 05:13.190]  You put stuff in the backpack.
[05:13.810 --> 05:14.590]  I don't think I do.
[05:18.850 --> 05:20.350]  Geoff doesn't know how to backpack works.
[05:21.890 --> 05:22.890]  You put things in it.
[05:23.010 --> 05:23.950]  Yeah, that's...
[05:23.950 --> 05:24.990]  Yeah, he says it's impossible.
[05:30.280 --> 05:31.460]  Why can't I climb this?
[05:36.260 --> 05:36.980]  Oh, no!
[05:38.380 --> 05:39.180]  Did that hurt you?
[05:42.980 --> 05:45.300]  There's stuff on the screen.
[05:46.940 --> 05:51.300]  I mean, I've got lungs and I've got a green bar that, you know, goes up and down based on them.
[05:51.840 --> 05:52.960]  You don't have a red heart?
[05:53.640 --> 05:55.240]  Oh, while climbing, you can use shifts.
[05:56.700 --> 05:57.420]  Oh, okay.
[05:57.540 --> 06:01.560]  If someone is above someone else, they can use right-click on the mouse
[06:01.560 --> 06:03.580]  if they're empty-handed to help a friend.
[06:03.880 --> 06:04.260]  Right-click here.
[06:07.180 --> 06:08.060]  Right-click me.
[06:08.140 --> 06:08.300]  Ready?
[06:08.880 --> 06:09.740]  Put your hand out.
[06:10.320 --> 06:10.980]  Put your hand out.
[06:15.360 --> 06:17.120]  Am I meant to click something different?
[06:18.860 --> 06:19.180]  Right-click.
[06:19.180 --> 06:19.900]  Do I just hold it out?
[06:20.160 --> 06:20.800]  I think so.
[06:22.220 --> 06:23.240]  Oh, you pulled me up!
[06:24.220 --> 06:24.400]  Nice.
[06:24.480 --> 06:24.960]  Oh, that's sick.
[06:24.980 --> 06:25.320]  That's cool.
[06:25.320 --> 06:27.420]  See, that's made up for me throwing you down.
[06:27.760 --> 06:29.900]  Oh, yeah, that'd help my health bar for sure.
[06:33.580 --> 06:36.500]  Let's keep moving up and see if we can find...
[06:36.500 --> 06:37.920]  because we're gonna have to find food and stuff,
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.320]  because I think everyone's gonna start getting hungry.
[06:39.540 --> 06:40.120]  Yeah, I have to find it.
[06:40.180 --> 06:40.500]  Keep going up.
[06:41.480 --> 06:42.020]  Keep going up.
[06:42.040 --> 06:42.380]  Where's Geoff?
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.720]  It looks like there's fruit over here.
[06:44.880 --> 06:45.080]  Geoff?
[06:45.340 --> 06:45.660]  Geoff?
[06:47.200 --> 06:48.100]  Geoff, where'd you go?
[06:49.280 --> 06:49.600]  Jay?
[06:49.660 --> 06:50.680]  Do you think I'll fucking find him?
[06:51.960 --> 06:52.600]  Joy... Joins?
[06:53.800 --> 06:54.120]  Are there...
[06:54.120 --> 06:54.360]  Hey, guys!
[06:54.480 --> 06:55.220]  There you are!
[06:55.220 --> 06:57.180]  Where are you?
[06:57.400 --> 06:57.900]  He's up there on the hill.
[06:58.120 --> 06:58.840]  I'm upstairs.
[06:59.800 --> 07:00.200]  Upstairs?
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.100]  Did I just die?
[07:02.800 --> 07:03.360]  No, what do you mean?
[07:03.940 --> 07:04.240]  What?
[07:04.380 --> 07:05.820]  Did someone just shoot me with something?
[07:06.380 --> 07:07.220]  No, what are you talking about?
[07:07.440 --> 07:07.920]  No, why?
[07:09.800 --> 07:10.580]  I think I'm...
[07:11.300 --> 07:11.640]  Huh.
[07:11.960 --> 07:12.980]  I think I'm hurt.
[07:14.100 --> 07:15.660]  You should probably eat some food.
[07:16.200 --> 07:17.160]  Yeah, but all my health went out.
[07:17.260 --> 07:17.740]  Did I, like...
[07:20.380 --> 07:20.780]  Geoff?
[07:21.460 --> 07:22.200]  Yeah, what's up?
[07:22.660 --> 07:23.500]  Did you shoot me?
[07:24.400 --> 07:24.800]  No.
[07:25.700 --> 07:27.620]  You threw a tree branch at my head?
[07:28.280 --> 07:28.620]  No!
[07:30.120 --> 07:30.420]  Huh.
[07:31.580 --> 07:32.240]  Would you like me to?
[07:32.360 --> 07:33.080]  Do you think it's because you're poisoned?
[07:33.280 --> 07:33.480]  No.
[07:34.400 --> 07:34.800]  Well, I don't know.
[07:34.800 --> 07:35.780]  You don't think it's because you're poisoned?
[07:36.180 --> 07:38.680]  Did I get unpoisoned and it took all my health away briefly?
[07:39.500 --> 07:39.860]  I don't know.
[07:39.980 --> 07:40.680]  What's up, Nick?
[07:40.900 --> 07:42.960]  Should pick up some of these coconut halves and eat them.
[07:43.460 --> 07:44.200]  I... We already did.
[07:45.060 --> 07:45.240]  Okay.
[07:52.390 --> 07:54.350]  Are you guys gonna come up here with me?
[07:54.450 --> 07:55.170]  I'm trying to.
[07:55.210 --> 07:56.310]  If someone can lend me a hand...
[07:56.310 --> 07:56.890]  Oop.
[07:58.010 --> 07:58.550]  Oh, Nick.
[07:59.110 --> 08:00.670]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
[08:01.830 --> 08:03.330]  All my stamina went away.
[08:03.370 --> 08:03.730]  That was bad.
[08:04.810 --> 08:05.990]  Can you help me when you get up?
[08:06.570 --> 08:07.810]  Yeah, when I reach the-
[08:07.810 --> 08:08.570]  Aaaaaaaah!
[08:09.590 --> 08:10.030]  Geoff!
[08:10.750 --> 08:11.190]  Ugh!
[08:11.550 --> 08:12.070]  Oh, no!
[08:12.770 --> 08:13.490]  Oh, shit.
[08:13.930 --> 08:15.170]  Geoff doesn't feel the need to help.
[08:15.350 --> 08:15.750]  Don't worry.
[08:16.090 --> 08:16.430]  Geoff!
[08:16.850 --> 08:18.290]  You can walk up to us.
[08:19.030 --> 08:20.770]  We're right next to you, man.
[08:23.270 --> 08:24.130]  You're not looking.
[08:24.870 --> 08:25.310]  Geoff!
[08:26.890 --> 08:28.610]  How do I begin climbing?
[08:29.650 --> 08:30.010]  Spacebar.
[08:32.770 --> 08:34.210]  Help us!
[08:37.450 --> 08:38.370]  I'm up!
[08:38.990 --> 08:41.330]  I gotcha!
[08:45.690 --> 08:47.710]  What's that? What's that music for?
[08:52.460 --> 08:54.540]  How do we get more stamina, like Link?
[08:55.540 --> 08:56.920]  I don't know.
[08:57.020 --> 08:58.060]  Do we get some shrines?
[09:00.500 --> 09:01.140]  Music? Cool.
[09:01.140 --> 09:02.420]  Need some hearts.
[09:03.920 --> 09:04.400]  Hi Geoff.
[09:04.800 --> 09:05.320]  Where's Eric?
[09:05.860 --> 09:06.740]  Are you still coming up, Eric?
[09:07.340 --> 09:08.140]  Oh, OK. There you are.
[09:08.160 --> 09:09.140]  Give me your hand. Right click.
[09:09.980 --> 09:10.580]  I gotcha.
[09:10.620 --> 09:11.020]  Thank you.
[09:11.780 --> 09:12.520]  Oh, look at that.
[09:12.700 --> 09:13.300]  Oh, Geoff.
[09:13.380 --> 09:14.080]  Oh, I died.
[09:17.740 --> 09:18.860]  He fully died?
[09:19.100 --> 09:19.240]  Oh.
[09:19.580 --> 09:20.680]  No, I just got hurt bad.
[09:22.080 --> 09:23.300]  I got an owie heart now.
[09:23.400 --> 09:24.300]  I got my first owie heart.
[09:25.140 --> 09:26.440]  Now I know what Eric's talking about.
[09:26.700 --> 09:26.900]  Yep.
[09:28.700 --> 09:31.260]  I've got an owie heart and a stomach owie.
[09:31.600 --> 09:32.960]  Well, the stomach, I think, is hungry.
[09:33.760 --> 09:34.160]  Yeah.
[09:34.480 --> 09:36.220]  Where'd these other two go? Did they fall?
[09:37.140 --> 09:37.940]  Stomach hungry.
[09:39.360 --> 09:39.940]  Alright, I'm back.
[09:40.780 --> 09:41.480]  I'm hurt bad.
[09:42.140 --> 09:43.140]  Yeah, I'm pretty hurt as well.
[09:43.200 --> 09:43.940]  I don't have enough stamina to go up a rock.
[09:44.180 --> 09:45.000]  Where are you?
[09:45.140 --> 09:45.800]  I'm in the city.
[09:46.040 --> 09:46.380]  I fell.
[09:48.520 --> 09:49.420]  Trying to help Geoff.
[09:51.040 --> 09:51.880]  I'm right here.
[09:52.020 --> 09:53.080]  Can you climb up to this part?
[09:54.000 --> 09:54.580]  It's pretty low.
[10:00.700 --> 10:02.060]  You have to...
[10:03.580 --> 10:04.140]  Climb.
[10:04.660 --> 10:05.180]  Left click.
[10:05.200 --> 10:06.120]  I can't climb any further.
[10:06.400 --> 10:07.300]  I have no...
[10:07.300 --> 10:08.100]  Right, grab my hand.
[10:08.180 --> 10:08.460]  Grab my hand.
[10:09.660 --> 10:11.120]  That's all the stamina I have.
[10:12.740 --> 10:13.260]  Grab my hand.
[10:13.840 --> 10:14.820]  Are you drooling?
[10:15.620 --> 10:16.640]  Leave me.
[10:17.340 --> 10:18.900]  Do you need health or something?
[10:19.640 --> 10:21.520]  Yeah, I'm totally dying.
[10:23.420 --> 10:25.160]  Does that do health?
[10:25.720 --> 10:26.500]  I don't know.
[10:27.580 --> 10:28.660]  It's the heart.
[10:28.800 --> 10:30.900]  Oh, I have bandages. Do you want bandages?
[10:31.360 --> 10:32.080]  Oh, yeah, yeah, please.
[10:34.200 --> 10:34.780]  Coming down.
[10:36.740 --> 10:37.420]  Nice toss.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.960]  With these, I'll be able to get up there for sure.
[10:40.380 --> 10:43.280]  Well, just use them and then just come to me.
[10:45.820 --> 10:46.700]  Grab my hand.
[10:48.160 --> 10:48.840]  I got you.
[10:48.860 --> 10:49.340]  Thank you.
[10:50.940 --> 10:52.100]  Okay, we're coming, boys.
[10:54.200 --> 10:55.340]  Watch out for these jellyfish.
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.000]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[10:57.240 --> 10:57.680]  Ow!
[11:01.600 --> 11:02.640]  You guys doing cool stuff up here?
[11:02.860 --> 11:03.940]  I can hear it.
[11:04.860 --> 11:05.940]  Whoa, are there bridges?
[11:06.260 --> 11:07.140]  Watch out for the sea urchins.
[11:08.200 --> 11:09.220]  Oh, is that bad?
[11:09.340 --> 11:10.300]  I imagine they hurt.
[11:12.120 --> 11:12.960]  Where are you guys?
[11:14.520 --> 11:15.580]  Hey, where are you guys?
[11:19.280 --> 11:19.720]  Hey!
[11:22.300 --> 11:23.440]  Where are you guys?
[11:26.500 --> 11:26.940]  What?
[11:26.940 --> 11:28.900]  Down here in the jizz rope?
[11:29.760 --> 11:31.800]  What does that mean?
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.000]  That's up.
[11:39.260 --> 11:39.700]  What?
[11:45.160 --> 11:45.680]  Whoa!
[11:47.120 --> 11:47.600]  I don't know.
[11:51.430 --> 11:52.410]  Am I grabbing it?
[11:52.730 --> 11:53.270]  I can't tell.
[11:55.410 --> 11:56.550]  I'm clicking on it.
[11:56.570 --> 11:56.950]  There we go.
[11:57.570 --> 11:58.050]  Yeah, pull me.
[11:59.350 --> 12:02.310]  No, I'm just climbing normal.
[12:02.830 --> 12:04.690]  What if I hang it over something better?
[12:07.070 --> 12:08.710]  Do I tie the knot in it?
[12:09.050 --> 12:10.050]  Hang on, let me tie it.
[12:12.530 --> 12:14.410]  Maybe I'm making this a permanent rope.
[12:14.590 --> 12:15.510]  There you go.
[12:16.250 --> 12:16.970]  Yeah, now I can.
[12:19.470 --> 12:22.230]  Yeah, you do that and it becomes a rope that I can climb.
[12:23.010 --> 12:24.350]  That's a waste, isn't it?
[12:25.810 --> 12:27.550]  If you're out of stamina, take a break.
[12:30.550 --> 12:31.610]  Can I get that back?
[12:31.730 --> 12:32.650]  Or is that permanently...
[12:32.650 --> 12:33.590]  No, I think it's probably permanent.
[12:33.590 --> 12:33.830]  Gotcha.
[12:34.430 --> 12:34.750]  Shit.
[12:35.970 --> 12:36.570]  Hey, we're coming.
[12:36.650 --> 12:37.370]  You're gonna have to help us.
[12:37.490 --> 12:37.850]  Oh, I gotcha.
[12:39.230 --> 12:40.230]  Where are we going from here?
[12:40.290 --> 12:41.490]  Is there another bridge over there where you guys are?
[12:42.770 --> 12:43.570]  There's one up higher.
[12:45.050 --> 12:45.850]  Can we get up?
[12:46.010 --> 12:46.750]  Yeah, we can climb.
[12:47.530 --> 12:48.370]  I'm looking around.
[12:49.170 --> 12:49.810]  Maybe not.
[12:50.070 --> 12:50.570]  Thank you.
[12:53.750 --> 12:54.630]  Oh, maybe not.
[12:55.850 --> 12:56.750]  Well, hold on, Geoff.
[12:56.830 --> 12:57.170]  There's a...
[12:59.690 --> 13:01.110]  Whoa, what a jump!
[13:02.010 --> 13:03.130]  There's a thing right here.
[13:04.070 --> 13:05.250]  Yeah, but where does that take you?
[13:06.290 --> 13:07.050]  To this tree.
[13:14.500 --> 13:17.080]  Gavin, I don't think it's worth coming over here.
[13:17.700 --> 13:18.220]  Don't do it.
[13:18.420 --> 13:19.560]  Yeah, there's nothing over here.
[13:19.640 --> 13:22.300]  These guys are jumping off fucking trees and shit.
[13:22.700 --> 13:23.660]  We can't just climb up?
[13:24.760 --> 13:26.400]  I don't think there's anywhere to climb.
[13:27.360 --> 13:28.740]  Should we climb up this way?
[13:29.180 --> 13:29.880]  Yeah, probably.
[13:30.840 --> 13:32.380]  Man, I wasted so much of that rope.
[13:32.840 --> 13:34.880]  You didn't tell me that there was so much slack on the floor.
[13:35.240 --> 13:37.440]  Yeah, I can't believe I didn't tell you that.
[13:37.580 --> 13:38.840]  The thing I didn't know you were doing.
[13:39.520 --> 13:40.180]  I couldn't see.
[13:45.980 --> 13:46.740]  What are you doing, Nick?
[13:47.020 --> 13:50.020]  I'm trying to figure out what the best course of action is to cross this.
[13:51.740 --> 13:53.120]  I think we just gotta go up higher.
[13:53.420 --> 13:53.620]  Yeah.
[13:54.220 --> 13:55.260]  But we gotta...
[13:55.260 --> 13:56.540]  Geoff and I have stumbled into a...
[13:56.540 --> 13:57.140]  I mean, you guys can come over here.
[13:57.260 --> 13:57.700]  There's some...
[13:57.700 --> 13:58.160]  There's rope.
[13:58.960 --> 13:59.220]  Okay.
[14:00.260 --> 14:01.200]  And we'll go down.
[14:01.320 --> 14:01.560]  Come over here.
[14:02.920 --> 14:04.140]  Was that an alley down?
[14:04.320 --> 14:05.240]  No, that was an okay down.
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.300]  If you stay close to the...
[14:10.400 --> 14:11.300]  Alright, let's see if we can...
[14:12.580 --> 14:13.420]  There's like a...
[14:13.420 --> 14:14.540]  There's like a...
[14:14.540 --> 14:15.280]  Luggage on the ground?
[14:15.320 --> 14:15.940]  Is there anything in there?
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.440]  I think they emptied it already.
[14:18.160 --> 14:18.360]  Okay.
[14:18.780 --> 14:19.620]  If you climb, I can grab you.
[14:19.800 --> 14:20.140]  Oh, look.
[14:20.160 --> 14:21.020]  I may not actually need it.
[14:21.360 --> 14:21.840]  Oh, you're good.
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.340]  Oh, here we go.
[14:23.740 --> 14:24.480]  How'd that rope work?
[14:24.580 --> 14:24.740]  Oh, you're good.
[14:25.460 --> 14:25.740]  Oh!
[14:26.420 --> 14:26.880]  Oh, yeah.
[14:27.100 --> 14:27.320]  There you go.
[14:27.380 --> 14:27.800]  I forgot about the rope.
[14:28.260 --> 14:29.580]  Gavin went up and left.
[14:29.920 --> 14:31.220]  So, let's go up that way.
[14:33.480 --> 14:35.020]  Oh, it's the red part of the day.
[14:37.060 --> 14:38.000]  Oh, my God.
[14:38.700 --> 14:40.320]  Oh, it's Sailor's Delight.
[14:40.900 --> 14:41.440]  Red Sky Night.
[14:41.920 --> 14:44.100]  It's Sailor's Delight.
[14:45.540 --> 14:46.400]  Fellas, fellas.
[14:46.520 --> 14:47.460]  It's Sailor's Delight.
[14:48.140 --> 14:48.500]  Fellas.
[14:49.080 --> 14:50.220]  Easy sees tonight.
[14:54.990 --> 14:55.410]  Alright.
[14:55.910 --> 14:56.230]  You ready?
[14:58.650 --> 14:59.490]  Alright, didn't need that.
[14:59.810 --> 15:00.890]  Is that just like a running jump?
[15:01.750 --> 15:01.910]  Yeah.
[15:03.170 --> 15:03.690]  Woohoo!
[15:03.890 --> 15:05.770]  Dude, look how up we're getting here.
[15:06.190 --> 15:06.870]  We're doing great.
[15:07.970 --> 15:08.650]  I don't know what...
[15:08.650 --> 15:10.190]  This is like chained together, but chained apart.
[15:10.190 --> 15:10.850]  Yeah.
[15:11.050 --> 15:11.350]  Yeah.
[15:12.090 --> 15:13.650]  I saw Ray play a little bit of this.
[15:13.790 --> 15:15.610]  I don't know what his problem was.
[15:15.930 --> 15:15.970]  The fog rises.
[15:16.490 --> 15:16.950]  Oh, oh.
[15:16.970 --> 15:17.470]  Oh, shit.
[15:17.850 --> 15:20.210]  So, now do we get lost if we fall down anymore?
[15:20.430 --> 15:20.670]  Uh-oh.
[15:20.790 --> 15:21.510]  So, Bane's here.
[15:21.810 --> 15:22.250]  Might be.
[15:22.830 --> 15:23.870]  The fog rises.
[15:24.910 --> 15:25.770]  Is that what he says?
[15:26.230 --> 15:26.550]  Nah.
[15:26.770 --> 15:27.570]  He says it with an F.
[15:28.630 --> 15:29.030]  What?
[15:29.430 --> 15:30.370]  We go down here.
[15:30.570 --> 15:30.850]  What?
[15:31.710 --> 15:32.930]  He says the fire rises.
[15:34.070 --> 15:34.410]  Oh.
[15:36.010 --> 15:36.530]  Oh, yeah.
[15:36.530 --> 15:37.110]  Anything up there, Geoff?
[15:38.090 --> 15:38.870]  Just a ledge.
[15:38.870 --> 15:40.590]  Dude, it's Fogville up here.
[15:41.870 --> 15:42.350]  I think...
[15:42.770 --> 15:43.690]  I think cross...
[15:43.690 --> 15:46.110]  I think we should cross this bridge here.
[15:53.180 --> 15:53.580]  Oh.
[16:03.160 --> 16:03.600]  What's up?
[16:03.620 --> 16:04.420]  I'm too far up.
[16:04.600 --> 16:05.220]  I'm too up.
[16:05.880 --> 16:06.840]  Well, you're really...
[16:06.840 --> 16:07.240]  How'd you...
[16:07.240 --> 16:08.100]  Oh, Geoff, no.
[16:08.340 --> 16:09.780]  Why'd you guys go up that way?
[16:09.880 --> 16:10.720]  Oh, you're crazy.
[16:11.460 --> 16:12.400]  Is this the wrong way?
[16:12.920 --> 16:13.520]  No, no, no, no.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.120]  You're fine.
[16:14.840 --> 16:15.080]  Ow.
[16:16.300 --> 16:16.900]  Uh-oh.
[16:17.040 --> 16:17.400]  Oh, no.
[16:17.760 --> 16:18.000]  Oh.
[16:19.400 --> 16:19.920]  Gavin?
[16:21.080 --> 16:21.180]  Yeah?
[16:21.260 --> 16:21.420]  Okay.
[16:21.780 --> 16:23.120]  I saw you fall.
[16:23.320 --> 16:23.980]  That looked bad.
[16:24.720 --> 16:26.820]  It was almost really bad.
[16:32.650 --> 16:33.950]  That didn't sound good either.
[16:35.930 --> 16:36.450]  Geoff.
[16:37.390 --> 16:38.010]  Hold on.
[16:38.150 --> 16:38.670]  Okay.
[16:41.150 --> 16:43.170]  I can't fucking get up on this thing.
[16:43.650 --> 16:45.330]  Geoff, you actually sound winded.
[16:46.350 --> 16:47.170]  Oh, my God.
[16:48.130 --> 16:49.390]  Dude, that's gonna be a jump.
[16:49.750 --> 16:51.110]  Oh, I know what could help us.
[16:51.690 --> 16:52.150]  What?
[16:52.530 --> 16:54.230]  Look at the package over there.
[16:54.970 --> 16:56.170]  Why didn't we open that?
[16:56.630 --> 16:57.050]  I don't know.
[16:57.110 --> 16:58.050]  I don't think we were that high.
[16:59.630 --> 17:02.310]  Dude, there's one over here, too.
[17:05.090 --> 17:05.550]  What?
[17:09.330 --> 17:10.290]  What are you doing?
[17:15.410 --> 17:16.810]  Someone might see us.
[17:17.630 --> 17:18.270]  Oh, yeah?
[17:18.470 --> 17:19.290]  In the cave?
[17:20.670 --> 17:22.170]  It goes right up into nothing.
[17:22.610 --> 17:23.190]  You got it.
[17:23.230 --> 17:23.670]  You got it, Gavin.
[17:24.710 --> 17:25.730]  I don't think I'm gonna...
[17:25.730 --> 17:26.370]  You don't think so?
[17:26.450 --> 17:27.930]  I think I'm gonna get really hurt when I...
[17:27.930 --> 17:28.710]  Okay, then move.
[17:28.790 --> 17:29.110]  I'll do it.
[17:29.430 --> 17:29.830]  Hang on.
[17:29.870 --> 17:30.190]  You know what?
[17:30.890 --> 17:32.570]  I have to eat all this trail mix first.
[17:32.910 --> 17:33.490]  Now I'm ready.
[17:33.750 --> 17:34.270]  Okay, boys.
[17:34.730 --> 17:35.250]  Here we go.
[17:35.630 --> 17:35.810]  Good luck.
[17:35.930 --> 17:36.130]  Are we jumping?
[17:36.710 --> 17:37.070]  Yeah!
[17:38.710 --> 17:39.070]  Wow.
[17:39.070 --> 17:39.510]  Oh, wow.
[17:39.870 --> 17:40.590]  Look at him go.
[17:41.430 --> 17:41.790]  Anybody...
[17:42.170 --> 17:42.530]  Boys!
[17:43.590 --> 17:44.370]  Medicine or anything?
[17:44.370 --> 17:45.430]  Now, Eric.
[17:45.430 --> 17:48.350]  I don't have the stamina for that, so can you pull me up?
[17:49.230 --> 17:50.530]  I have my hand out.
[17:51.070 --> 17:51.710]  I have my hand.
[17:52.010 --> 17:52.830]  Oh, I tell you what, Eric.
[17:53.050 --> 17:53.230]  No.
[17:53.510 --> 17:53.870]  Tell you what.
[17:53.970 --> 17:56.230]  Catch this rope and make us a rope.
[17:57.670 --> 17:58.090]  Okay.
[17:58.730 --> 17:59.170]  Oh, God.
[17:59.170 --> 18:00.850]  Please do it soon, because I'm gonna die here.
[18:03.730 --> 18:04.830]  I'll get the rope.
[18:07.530 --> 18:07.950]  Wait.
[18:08.330 --> 18:08.750]  No!
[18:11.110 --> 18:12.450]  Nick, it went down pretty far.
[18:13.230 --> 18:13.890]  Really far.
[18:14.710 --> 18:15.410]  All right, Eric.
[18:15.410 --> 18:17.010]  I'm gonna have to jump before my stomach gives out.
[18:17.070 --> 18:17.590]  Can you pull me?
[18:18.230 --> 18:18.870]  Uh, hang on.
[18:19.510 --> 18:20.010]  What's that?
[18:22.290 --> 18:22.890]  A flare.
[18:23.130 --> 18:23.870]  I found the rope.
[18:25.230 --> 18:26.330]  I'll get through the rope, buddy.
[18:26.590 --> 18:28.250]  I'm crouching my hands out.
[18:34.080 --> 18:35.540]  Why is it so quivery?
[18:35.980 --> 18:36.880]  Come on over.
[18:37.500 --> 18:38.600]  My hand's out, buddy.
[18:38.700 --> 18:39.200]  All right, here we go.
[18:40.240 --> 18:40.440]  Yep.
[18:42.300 --> 18:43.080]  Grab onto me.
[18:43.260 --> 18:43.560]  Climb!
[18:44.160 --> 18:44.580]  Got it?
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.820]  Good climb didn't take.
[18:53.420 --> 18:54.280]  What'd you find, Nick?
[18:55.400 --> 18:56.280]  I found...
[18:56.280 --> 18:56.420]  Where's the suitcase?
[18:56.900 --> 18:59.180]  Well, I have the rope, and I got a water bottle.
[19:00.540 --> 19:02.280]  Seems to give you energy, but nothing else.
[19:02.480 --> 19:03.720]  Oh, there's another suitcase over there.
[19:03.760 --> 19:04.260]  Should I check it out?
[19:05.220 --> 19:06.020]  Yeah, go for it, man.
[19:06.500 --> 19:06.840]  All right.
[19:07.080 --> 19:08.780]  I don't know how to get to you, Eric.
[19:09.760 --> 19:11.420]  How much stamina do you have?
[19:12.200 --> 19:13.940]  Like 30% of the bar.
[19:14.260 --> 19:15.220]  What's in your backpack?
[19:16.880 --> 19:17.520]  Oh, God.
[19:17.940 --> 19:18.340]  Nothing.
[19:20.840 --> 19:21.720]  Fucking trumpet.
[19:22.680 --> 19:24.580]  All right, Eric, I'm gonna try again.
[19:24.960 --> 19:27.160]  Okay, I'm crouching, and I got my hand out.
[19:31.380 --> 19:32.260]  Come on.
[19:32.580 --> 19:33.260]  Come on, Gavin.
[19:33.560 --> 19:34.220]  Come on.
[19:36.340 --> 19:38.920]  You can try coming this way a little bit.
[19:39.220 --> 19:40.520]  Did I die? I died.
[19:40.780 --> 19:41.640]  I have my hand out.
[19:41.700 --> 19:42.660]  Get all the bar over here.
[19:44.880 --> 19:45.320]  Gavin?
[19:45.660 --> 19:46.240]  Come on, Geoff.
[19:46.560 --> 19:47.160]  Come on, Geoff.
[19:47.400 --> 19:48.320]  Is Gavin dead?
[19:48.320 --> 19:48.920]  Come on, Geoff.
[19:50.060 --> 19:51.000]  Come on, Geoff.
[19:52.580 --> 19:53.240]  Come on.
[19:53.820 --> 19:56.020]  I think they're both dead.
[19:56.720 --> 19:57.500]  Are they really?
[20:00.740 --> 20:01.220]  Gavin?
[20:03.240 --> 20:03.720]  Geoff?
[20:03.880 --> 20:05.660]  I'm gonna come down and investigate.
[20:07.160 --> 20:07.640]  Guys?
[20:09.200 --> 20:10.480]  Hold on, let me look at the wilderness book.
[20:13.060 --> 20:15.520]  I did hear you rifling through the pages.
[20:16.080 --> 20:16.800]  No, no, no.
[20:16.840 --> 20:17.260]  Oh, boy.
[20:18.320 --> 20:19.220]  Stay hungry.
[20:19.580 --> 20:20.520]  Actually, don't.
[20:20.520 --> 20:21.220]  Don't overpack.
[20:24.240 --> 20:28.780]  You're like the nerd in the movie where you're just like, maybe the book will help us.
[20:29.320 --> 20:30.440]  Well, it didn't.
[20:30.540 --> 20:32.060]  Okay, granola bar for me.
[20:32.880 --> 20:33.460]  Are you hungry?
[20:34.900 --> 20:37.100]  Hang on, I gotta rescue our friends real quick.
[20:37.240 --> 20:38.120]  How do we rescue them?
[20:38.720 --> 20:39.340]  Beats me.
[20:40.120 --> 20:40.960]  But we have to try.
[20:41.560 --> 20:41.580]  Geoff!
[20:42.760 --> 20:43.240]  Geoff?
[20:43.860 --> 20:44.340]  Hello?
[20:44.520 --> 20:44.880]  Geoff!
[20:45.340 --> 20:46.060]  I see Geoff!
[20:46.820 --> 20:48.640]  Both their bodies are next to each other.
[20:49.920 --> 20:51.320]  I can pick him up!
[20:57.100 --> 20:57.900]  A compass?
[21:01.340 --> 21:02.360]  So where's the other body?
[21:03.700 --> 21:04.960]  It's right here, it's the skeleton!
[21:05.560 --> 21:05.800]  Oh.
[21:06.020 --> 21:06.800]  Can I do anything with it?
[21:07.380 --> 21:07.820]  I don't know.
[21:09.140 --> 21:10.460]  It's not giving me a prompt.
[21:10.840 --> 21:11.180]  Uh-oh.
[21:12.160 --> 21:13.720]  I don't know how to get Geoff somewhere.
[21:13.980 --> 21:14.600]  What do I do?
[21:18.060 --> 21:18.460]  Um...
[21:18.460 --> 21:18.980]  We gotta climb down.
[21:19.120 --> 21:19.320]  Here, take this.
[21:19.600 --> 21:20.920]  Hang on, hang on. Come down here.
[21:21.760 --> 21:22.000]  Okay.
[21:22.140 --> 21:23.000]  Whoa, there's a ghost!
[21:23.220 --> 21:23.500]  There's a ghost following.
[21:26.400 --> 21:26.800]  Gavin?
[21:27.120 --> 21:27.800]  Is that you?
[21:28.840 --> 21:29.440]  Uh-oh!
[21:29.900 --> 21:30.800]  He turned into a skeleton!
[21:31.020 --> 21:31.320]  You're mine!
[21:38.770 --> 21:39.570]  Thank you.
[21:39.630 --> 21:40.190]  There you go.
[21:42.350 --> 21:43.630]  Well, I hear them sometimes.
[21:44.330 --> 21:45.370]  Yeah, are you guys around here?
[21:45.850 --> 21:46.930]  Yeah, I can hear you now.
[21:47.390 --> 21:48.690]  Get resurrected with the statue.
[21:49.330 --> 21:50.250]  Oh, there's a statue?
[21:51.070 --> 21:52.030]  I think I'm haunting Nick.
[21:53.510 --> 21:54.970]  I think I'm haunting Eric.
[21:55.170 --> 21:56.330]  Yeah, I can hear both.
[21:56.690 --> 21:57.870]  I can hear both of you.
[21:58.170 --> 21:58.890]  Oh, cool.
[21:59.450 --> 22:00.690]  Oh, so the ghost...
[22:01.250 --> 22:03.930]  Yeah, I bled out. You took so long to get to me, I died.
[22:04.190 --> 22:04.950]  We didn't know...
[22:04.950 --> 22:06.530]  I don't know what to do when you're down.
[22:06.690 --> 22:07.970]  Nick, let's go this way.
[22:08.090 --> 22:08.230]  Okay.
[22:08.350 --> 22:11.870]  I think you, like, maybe hit us with, like, a first aid patch or something, if you have one.
[22:11.970 --> 22:12.890]  I don't think anybody has any.
[22:13.870 --> 22:16.770]  But if we go to the statue, we resurrect, so...
[22:17.230 --> 22:20.130]  Okay, guys, let's go to the statue, the thing we all know.
[22:22.330 --> 22:24.890]  I didn't read anything about the statue in the booklet.
[22:27.590 --> 22:32.810]  Nick, Nick, going through the book while you guys are dead is so fucking funny.
[22:33.390 --> 22:34.950]  Hang on, hang on, let me consult the book.
[22:34.970 --> 22:36.550]  Hold on, hold on, first aid, first aid.
[22:38.510 --> 22:40.210]  I see you, get away from me.
[22:40.550 --> 22:41.250]  Get out of here.
[22:43.750 --> 22:45.510]  I'm just haunting the front of Eric's face.
[22:45.510 --> 22:47.470]  It's hard to see.
[22:48.450 --> 22:49.730]  Geoff's doing it.
[22:49.990 --> 22:52.750]  Where are we supposed to go?
[22:55.170 --> 22:57.450]  Is that a statue or is that just a thing?
[22:57.450 --> 22:57.550]  Where?
[22:58.010 --> 23:02.310]  Hit the middle click button to tag shit.
[23:03.030 --> 23:03.270]  That?
[23:03.870 --> 23:04.750]  See the ping over there?
[23:05.870 --> 23:06.190]  No.
[23:06.870 --> 23:08.830]  Oh, middle click button does nothing for me.
[23:09.230 --> 23:11.210]  Although it could be Gavin hovering in my face.
[23:11.490 --> 23:14.470]  Oh, oh, no, it's just because the notebook is so small.
[23:15.690 --> 23:18.210]  Do I get do I get closer and further away when I do this?
[23:18.470 --> 23:19.310]  Oh, yeah, you're moving.
[23:20.290 --> 23:21.270]  Oh, that's awesome.
[23:21.350 --> 23:23.210]  It's a really far drop right to your fucking face.
[23:23.330 --> 23:23.870]  That's great.
[23:24.770 --> 23:25.430]  Oh, my God.
[23:25.470 --> 23:26.470]  You were right on my grill.
[23:27.470 --> 23:29.230]  Geoff, I can't believe we died like that.
[23:30.550 --> 23:31.470]  Oh, that's a big.
[23:31.570 --> 23:32.310]  This is just the.
[23:32.750 --> 23:34.170]  Oh, oh, no, I'm poisoned.
[23:34.310 --> 23:35.170]  That's a big suitcase.
[23:36.030 --> 23:37.470]  Come on, Eric, let's get to the suitcase.
[23:37.770 --> 23:38.810]  You got stabbed by the purple plant.
[23:39.330 --> 23:39.670]  Yep.
[23:39.970 --> 23:41.310]  Oh, that is a big suitcase.
[23:41.350 --> 23:41.710]  Shit.
[23:41.770 --> 23:42.590]  How do we?
[23:42.650 --> 23:43.790]  Oh, we got to go sideways.
[23:43.790 --> 23:44.890]  We just got to go sideways.
[23:44.970 --> 23:45.690]  We just got to go sideways.
[23:46.030 --> 23:46.530]  Oh, OK.
[23:46.750 --> 23:47.970]  Do you have the stamina for that?
[23:48.170 --> 23:48.650]  That's crazy.
[23:50.550 --> 23:52.610]  Oh, I wasn't looking at that.
[23:52.750 --> 23:53.010]  Lunch.
[23:53.230 --> 23:54.710]  Here, we'll go up the tree over here.
[23:54.930 --> 23:55.830]  Oh, I made it.
[23:56.190 --> 23:56.950]  Eric, that was close.
[23:57.210 --> 23:57.410]  Oh, wow, you.
[23:59.150 --> 23:59.470]  You.
[23:59.650 --> 24:00.950]  Yeah, Nick, do what you feel.
[24:01.070 --> 24:02.170]  I'm going to see what's in this thing.
[24:02.830 --> 24:03.550]  Oh, no.
[24:03.730 --> 24:04.310]  Oh, Eric.
[24:04.350 --> 24:04.910]  Oh, no.
[24:05.070 --> 24:05.570]  Eric, you're done.
[24:05.590 --> 24:06.190]  Oh, no.
[24:06.830 --> 24:07.490]  Oh, no.
[24:07.810 --> 24:07.850]  Lunch, Eric.
[24:07.930 --> 24:08.110]  Lunch.
[24:09.590 --> 24:09.950]  No.
[24:10.410 --> 24:10.730]  No.
[24:11.490 --> 24:20.930]  Oh, no.
[24:20.970 --> 24:21.710]  He's going down.
[24:23.570 --> 24:24.430]  Nick, he's down.
[24:24.630 --> 24:25.230]  Nick, what are you doing?
[24:27.030 --> 24:27.350]  Nick.
[24:28.850 --> 24:30.170]  Eric, I came to save you.
[24:34.720 --> 24:35.560]  Did it look cool?
[24:35.760 --> 24:37.060]  How did you help me up?
[24:37.460 --> 24:38.200]  I didn't.
[24:39.140 --> 24:39.500]  Oh, really?
[24:39.520 --> 24:40.660]  I just got near you, I guess.
[24:41.300 --> 24:42.880]  How did you get up again, Eric?
[24:42.940 --> 24:43.380]  I don't know.
[24:43.480 --> 24:44.860]  I just all of a sudden was standing up.
[24:45.380 --> 24:46.260]  You have no health.
[24:47.540 --> 24:48.420]  No, I have no health.
[24:48.760 --> 24:49.720]  Oh, oh, oh, big suitcase.
[24:50.460 --> 24:51.540]  Why did you jump?
[24:54.620 --> 24:55.460]  It wasn't that...
[24:57.680 --> 24:58.360]  Oh, he died.
[24:58.720 --> 25:00.020]  He died.
[25:00.480 --> 25:01.100]  Did he bleed out?
[25:01.140 --> 25:02.320]  This is so far.
[25:02.620 --> 25:03.760]  It's so far.
[25:08.400 --> 25:10.120]  They're both out cold.
[25:13.940 --> 25:15.540]  We lost a...
[25:17.860 --> 25:18.720]  Well, boys.
[25:19.460 --> 25:20.400]  Rough go.
[25:24.960 --> 25:26.220]  Hit the next button.
[25:26.380 --> 25:26.740]  Damn you.
[25:27.140 --> 25:28.200]  Oh, my God.
[25:37.870 --> 25:39.150]  I feel like we learned a lot.
[25:39.290 --> 25:39.510]  Yeah.
[25:39.750 --> 25:40.510]  Yeah, dude.
[25:40.630 --> 25:41.490]  I think we should go.
[25:41.590 --> 25:44.570]  The goal is to get as many meters up as you can, I guess.
[25:44.750 --> 25:45.610]  I think so.
[25:46.130 --> 25:48.170]  And it's giving you that little countdown timer.
[25:48.770 --> 25:49.790]  You can't be hurt.
[25:51.510 --> 25:54.330]  So if you fall on your own, you're fucked.
[25:55.050 --> 25:59.730]  I don't want to take this fucking, this stupid backpack this time because it doesn't do anything.
[25:59.750 --> 26:00.470]  For me.
[26:01.710 --> 26:02.610]  You take it.
[26:02.910 --> 26:04.830]  It doesn't do anything for you?
[26:05.070 --> 26:05.270]  I don't know.
[26:05.270 --> 26:05.710]  I put it on.
[26:05.890 --> 26:05.930]  I don't know.
[26:06.030 --> 26:07.230]  I don't seem to have access to it.
[26:07.450 --> 26:08.530]  It doesn't float your boat.
[26:09.930 --> 26:10.950]  Dude, I need a compass.
[26:11.350 --> 26:11.690]  We took it.
[26:11.770 --> 26:12.150]  Did I take it?
[26:12.550 --> 26:13.750]  Oh, this lantern will come in handy.
[26:14.010 --> 26:14.310]  Give me thanks.
[26:14.550 --> 26:16.850]  You just made a whole big fucking thing about it.
[26:16.870 --> 26:18.330]  I was just trying to figure it out.
[26:18.410 --> 26:18.510]  Here.
[26:18.610 --> 26:18.930]  Hold on a second.
[26:20.210 --> 26:20.530]  Ow.
[26:23.130 --> 26:24.190]  You can throw these.
[26:24.890 --> 26:25.410]  That's kind of cool.
[26:25.630 --> 26:25.950]  Sure.
[26:26.070 --> 26:27.230]  You can throw anything.
[26:30.890 --> 26:34.810]  So if we wanted to, we could just make our life here on the beach and just eat and...
[26:34.810 --> 26:35.230]  Yeah, right?
[26:35.330 --> 26:40.430]  Why don't we put a shitload of coconuts in the backpack and we can all have a meal halfway up?
[26:41.390 --> 26:42.650]  How do you put stuff in the backpack?
[26:43.670 --> 26:44.370]  Can we give it a shot?
[26:44.530 --> 26:45.670]  If somebody wants to go up and get them?
[26:45.710 --> 26:48.050]  I think we can access it on your back, Geoff.
[26:49.070 --> 26:50.370]  Oh, that's maybe how it works.
[26:50.410 --> 26:51.070]  It's very easy.
[26:51.250 --> 26:53.290]  Also, Geoff, you can access it at any time.
[26:53.370 --> 26:53.950]  It's very easy.
[26:54.050 --> 26:54.550]  How do I do that?
[26:54.550 --> 26:55.070]  How do I do that?
[26:55.070 --> 27:02.910]  You hit 4, so you can see it, but I'm wearing it, and then you're able to put stuff into it.
[27:03.330 --> 27:03.710]  Oh.
[27:05.890 --> 27:06.410]  Coconut.
[27:08.010 --> 27:08.990]  Oh, shit.
[27:09.030 --> 27:09.170]  Ah!
[27:11.450 --> 27:11.970]  Okay.
[27:12.810 --> 27:13.330]  There.
[27:13.710 --> 27:14.770]  And then can you guys put it in?
[27:15.110 --> 27:16.210]  Yeah, I'm putting stuff in.
[27:16.810 --> 27:17.090]  There you go.
[27:17.930 --> 27:18.790]  Here, eat this.
[27:19.350 --> 27:19.870]  I fed you.
[27:20.710 --> 27:21.230]  Thanks.
[27:21.770 --> 27:22.470]  Thank you.
[27:24.530 --> 27:25.530]  Don't eat your backpack.
[27:27.630 --> 27:31.670]  Only put whole ones in there, I think, because the halves we can just eat right now.
[27:31.750 --> 27:32.130]  That's true.
[27:32.290 --> 27:32.450]  Yep.
[27:32.690 --> 27:32.990]  Oops.
[27:33.110 --> 27:34.650]  Why do I have a fucking coconut in my hand?
[27:35.450 --> 27:36.010]  Stand still.
[27:36.410 --> 27:37.370]  You picked it up.
[27:38.490 --> 27:39.370]  How'd you get them down?
[27:39.450 --> 27:40.410]  I have so much, dude.
[27:40.490 --> 27:41.390]  This is so...
[27:41.390 --> 27:42.250]  This is so fucked.
[27:42.350 --> 27:43.310]  Half my stamina is gone.
[27:44.810 --> 27:46.190]  Does it add weight to you?
[27:46.430 --> 27:46.670]  Yeah.
[27:47.170 --> 27:47.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:49.450 --> 27:50.170]  Oh, interesting.
[27:50.170 --> 27:53.330]  Do you think the map is the same every time?
[27:53.890 --> 27:53.990]  No.
[27:54.490 --> 27:56.050]  So it's procedurally generated?
[27:57.050 --> 27:57.570]  Probably.
[27:59.170 --> 27:59.850]  I would think so.
[28:00.150 --> 28:00.610]  Oh, a spool and a flare.
[28:02.090 --> 28:03.430]  I have a flare as well.
[28:03.750 --> 28:04.830]  There's a spool and peak?
[28:06.670 --> 28:07.390]  A what?
[28:09.270 --> 28:10.010]  That's funny.
[28:11.930 --> 28:13.510]  I'm taking these coconuts out.
[28:13.690 --> 28:14.910]  That's an old reference.
[28:15.290 --> 28:15.670]  Okay.
[28:17.730 --> 28:18.850]  Fun house, isn't it?
[28:19.170 --> 28:19.690]  Yeah.
[28:21.810 --> 28:23.650]  Did they have trouble with this heist as well?
[28:26.110 --> 28:27.990]  Nah, they just had a guy named spool and a guy named peak.
[28:28.110 --> 28:28.410]  I remember.
[28:31.630 --> 28:32.190]  Yeah, you're right.
[28:32.230 --> 28:32.930]  You don't remember shit.
[28:34.070 --> 28:35.390]  You got me, I was lying.
[28:35.670 --> 28:36.550]  Just trying to fit in.
[28:38.190 --> 28:39.930]  Guys, I get the reference, please.
[28:40.810 --> 28:41.350]  Shut up.
[28:41.470 --> 28:41.670]  Okay.
[28:43.610 --> 28:44.630]  What if we...
[28:44.630 --> 28:47.090]  What if we go around instead of going straight at it?
[28:47.710 --> 28:49.410]  Maybe over to the left there's a better angle.
[28:49.410 --> 28:50.610]  Of approach.
[28:57.460 --> 28:59.920]  It's lonely, the life of the backpack man.
[29:00.560 --> 29:02.120]  The mule of the team.
[29:11.380 --> 29:13.160]  Just kill me on this island now.
[29:15.820 --> 29:16.820]  You want some energy?
[29:17.580 --> 29:18.680]  No, I'm good.
[29:19.760 --> 29:20.100]  You sure?
[29:20.420 --> 29:21.660]  I'll hang on to it for later, I guess.
[29:21.900 --> 29:23.680]  Yeah, you should definitely hang on to it.
[29:25.400 --> 29:26.360]  Hell yeah.
[29:28.460 --> 29:28.920]  Ouch.
[29:34.590 --> 29:35.510]  Anything good?
[29:36.710 --> 29:37.170]  Energy?
[29:37.510 --> 29:38.030]  He said...
[29:38.030 --> 29:39.770]  He said something about progress.
[29:39.890 --> 29:42.070]  I couldn't tell if it was he made progress or bad progress.
[29:43.830 --> 29:44.750]  Thick mints.
[29:45.050 --> 29:45.570]  Thick mints.
[29:45.710 --> 29:46.770]  Thick mints.
[29:46.930 --> 29:47.630]  Who wants to take the thick mints?
[29:47.630 --> 29:48.410]  I'm going to take the sports...
[29:48.410 --> 29:50.070]  I'm taking the sports drink.
[29:53.110 --> 29:54.050]  Probably just food.
[29:55.230 --> 29:55.630]  Found you.
[29:55.790 --> 29:57.310]  Can you climb with something in your hand?
[29:57.470 --> 29:57.670]  No.
[29:57.670 --> 29:58.740]  I don't think so.
[29:59.670 --> 30:00.930]  Alright, well we can't because...
[30:00.930 --> 30:01.350]  Should we go...
[30:02.330 --> 30:04.390]  Should we go around further to the side or what?
[30:05.670 --> 30:08.130]  I went over there and it kind of dead ends into some...
[30:08.130 --> 30:08.950]  into fog.
[30:09.450 --> 30:11.650]  Okay, now let's climb up here and see what's up.
[30:11.710 --> 30:12.230]  Yeah, let's do it.
[30:12.350 --> 30:12.930]  Let's give it a shot.
[30:14.470 --> 30:15.850]  Now remember to help the backpack man.
[30:19.630 --> 30:21.410]  He is strong and weak at the same time.
[30:26.350 --> 30:26.710]  Hmm.
[30:27.590 --> 30:27.970]  Alright.
[30:29.550 --> 30:30.130]  Oh, sorry.
[30:33.970 --> 30:37.270]  Alright, we can have a food break if we need it because there's more coconuts.
[30:38.190 --> 30:39.290]  Yeah, you want to climb up and get them?
[30:39.990 --> 30:40.290]  No.
[30:41.150 --> 30:43.230]  We should definitely, I think, be mindful of that.
[30:43.410 --> 30:45.190]  Is just keep an eye and see if we can...
[30:45.190 --> 30:45.310]  Oh.
[30:46.390 --> 30:47.550]  Save off the hunger.
[30:47.790 --> 30:48.770]  Can I eat these shrimps?
[30:49.290 --> 30:50.250]  Alright, I'm going to eat some shrimps.
[30:50.390 --> 30:51.310]  You should not eat those shrimps.
[30:51.370 --> 30:52.130]  Don't eat those shrimps.
[30:52.150 --> 30:52.790]  No, no, no, no, no.
[30:52.910 --> 30:54.130]  Hold on, let me look at the book.
[30:54.510 --> 30:54.890]  No, no, no.
[30:54.890 --> 30:55.970]  I ate them last game.
[30:56.490 --> 30:57.550]  Were they not good?
[30:58.390 --> 30:59.470]  I thought they were fine.
[30:59.890 --> 31:00.310]  Eat them.
[31:02.150 --> 31:03.150]  I fed them to Nick.
[31:04.550 --> 31:04.970]  What?
[31:08.310 --> 31:13.410]  Oh, no.
[31:13.690 --> 31:14.390]  I'm getting poisoned.
[31:14.650 --> 31:15.390]  I just...
[31:17.890 --> 31:22.130]  Hey, can you, like, climb on me and you, like, get a boost or something?
[31:23.550 --> 31:26.630]  No, you probably walked into that purple plant.
[31:27.610 --> 31:28.830]  Yeah, you hit the jellyfish.
[31:29.390 --> 31:29.710]  Hey.
[31:30.550 --> 31:30.870]  Hey.
[31:32.170 --> 31:32.490]  Hey.
[31:32.810 --> 31:33.530]  Hey, you.
[31:33.670 --> 31:34.210]  Can you...
[31:34.210 --> 31:36.430]  Can you climb on me and get, like, a boost or something?
[31:37.570 --> 31:39.050]  Is that something that you can do in this game?
[31:40.610 --> 31:41.330]  Yeah, I think so.
[31:43.730 --> 31:44.830]  Oh, you did throw it up on me.
[31:44.830 --> 31:45.330]  You didn't grab the trees.
[31:45.410 --> 31:46.110]  Yeah, I'm trying to.
[31:47.030 --> 31:48.350]  Did you punch me in the face?
[31:48.670 --> 31:51.590]  No, I'm trying to crouch and then jump to see if it'll throw you up.
[31:53.710 --> 31:54.350]  Alright, uh...
[31:54.350 --> 31:54.990]  Okay, try it.
[31:55.550 --> 31:56.310]  Yeah, that works.
[31:56.310 --> 31:57.030]  Oh, cool.
[31:57.330 --> 31:57.850]  Hell yeah.
[31:57.930 --> 31:58.930]  You, like, threw me up the tree.
[32:02.270 --> 32:03.270]  Uh, toss some coconuts down.
[32:04.310 --> 32:05.050]  Uh, you got it.
[32:06.350 --> 32:07.010]  Right over here.
[32:07.270 --> 32:07.830]  Over here.
[32:07.990 --> 32:08.390]  Right over here.
[32:08.450 --> 32:08.830]  Did it drop?
[32:09.030 --> 32:09.470]  Did it drop here?
[32:09.510 --> 32:09.650]  Yep.
[32:10.230 --> 32:10.390]  Yep.
[32:10.530 --> 32:11.050]  Alright, another one.
[32:11.810 --> 32:12.450]  Thank you.
[32:14.710 --> 32:16.590]  Did you poison me or did I poison myself?
[32:16.630 --> 32:17.530]  Oh, Gavin, no!
[32:19.090 --> 32:19.730]  Ah, shit.
[32:19.970 --> 32:21.790]  You gotta hit spacebar when you hit the ledge.
[32:22.810 --> 32:23.730]  I keep hitting it.
[32:23.730 --> 32:27.330]  I feel like it only works off the...
[32:27.330 --> 32:28.690]  Well, maybe that's the problem.
[32:28.690 --> 32:29.390]  Is there anything up this way, Geoff, or no?
[32:29.950 --> 32:30.690]  Uh, nah.
[32:31.310 --> 32:31.470]  Okay.
[32:31.810 --> 32:32.710]  There's a dead end up there.
[32:33.410 --> 32:37.110]  I mean, I could have maybe jumped to the tree that you're already on, but...
[32:38.310 --> 32:43.250]  You know, I gotta say, I, uh, I haven't decided if I like this game yet or not.
[32:43.390 --> 32:43.910]  Yeah, me neither.
[32:44.150 --> 32:47.130]  I can't figure out where we're, like...
[32:47.130 --> 32:49.070]  I can't figure out quite where we're supposed to go.
[32:50.610 --> 32:51.830]  Oh, there's a suitcase over there.
[32:52.030 --> 32:52.710]  Oh, let's go.
[32:52.930 --> 32:53.510]  I'm with you.
[32:56.130 --> 32:57.450]  I just don't know how to do anything.
[32:59.110 --> 32:59.390]  Right.
[33:01.310 --> 33:02.090]  Well, I'll help you.
[33:02.150 --> 33:02.570]  Where are you?
[33:03.310 --> 33:03.730]  Come on.
[33:03.750 --> 33:04.170]  You got it.
[33:04.190 --> 33:04.550]  You got it.
[33:04.550 --> 33:04.870]  Come on.
[33:04.870 --> 33:05.290]  Come on.
[33:05.290 --> 33:05.650]  A little higher.
[33:06.030 --> 33:06.310]  Lunge.
[33:06.530 --> 33:06.710]  Lunge.
[33:06.990 --> 33:08.050]  If you lunge, you make it to me.
[33:08.510 --> 33:08.770]  Ah!
[33:10.690 --> 33:10.970]  Ah!
[33:13.770 --> 33:14.910]  But it felt like we did it.
[33:15.070 --> 33:15.630]  We did it.
[33:15.670 --> 33:16.210]  Then we fell.
[33:18.090 --> 33:18.370]  God.
[33:19.050 --> 33:19.470]  Dang it.
[33:19.610 --> 33:20.030]  Alright, hold on.
[33:20.050 --> 33:20.410]  I'll do it again.
[33:20.730 --> 33:21.570]  I got, like, a...
[33:21.570 --> 33:23.130]  I got, like, a closed hand symbol.
[33:23.130 --> 33:23.670]  Yeah, me too!
[33:24.170 --> 33:25.570]  I guess it pulled me down, maybe.
[33:30.630 --> 33:30.990]  Alright.
[33:32.130 --> 33:33.630]  I think I'm more steadily footed.
[33:39.710 --> 33:40.430]  Oh, Gavin!
[33:41.870 --> 33:42.550]  Oh, come on.
[33:42.550 --> 33:42.870]  Oh, yes!
[33:43.110 --> 33:43.810]  Come on, yes!
[33:44.170 --> 33:44.410]  Alright.
[33:44.650 --> 33:45.010]  Yes.
[33:45.270 --> 33:45.390]  Yes.
[33:45.570 --> 33:45.630]  Yes.
[33:45.830 --> 33:46.990]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:48.190 --> 33:49.070]  Alright, over here.
[33:49.690 --> 33:50.110]  We can do this.
[33:50.730 --> 33:51.470]  Yeah, this is good.
[33:51.550 --> 33:52.350]  There's a lot of ledges here.
[33:53.410 --> 33:53.770]  Yeah.
[33:53.970 --> 33:54.310]  Oh.
[33:57.150 --> 34:01.370]  I don't know if we want to go sideways towards the luggage or keep going up.
[34:02.630 --> 34:05.550]  Oh, I think the luggage... look, there's a giant bridge over there.
[34:06.850 --> 34:07.630]  Oh, yeah.
[34:07.930 --> 34:08.850]  Maybe you can go around.
[34:09.650 --> 34:10.170]  Up and over.
[34:11.290 --> 34:11.930]  I don't know, though.
[34:11.930 --> 34:12.510]  Oh, yeah.
[34:12.670 --> 34:13.090]  Good idea.
[34:13.310 --> 34:13.890]  Not a good idea.
[34:14.590 --> 34:16.150]  Gotta go left to go right, maybe?
[34:16.230 --> 34:16.710]  I don't know.
[34:17.270 --> 34:17.610]  Where are you guys?
[34:17.630 --> 34:18.510]  Maybe you can climb that?
[34:18.870 --> 34:19.230]  We're...
[34:19.230 --> 34:20.590]  I'm looking for you.
[34:21.330 --> 34:22.330]  We're up above.
[34:22.510 --> 34:23.250]  We're at the bridge.
[34:23.390 --> 34:24.970]  Like, the very first bridge that we found.
[34:25.430 --> 34:25.950]  The first game.
[34:28.650 --> 34:29.290]  I don't...
[34:30.370 --> 34:31.870]  We're up above the trees.
[34:32.070 --> 34:34.790]  Like, right next to, like, the trees that you guys grabbed all the coconuts from.
[34:35.450 --> 34:35.690]  Gavin?
[34:35.870 --> 34:36.350]  Yeah, I'm alright.
[34:36.890 --> 34:37.150]  Slips.
[34:37.170 --> 34:37.390]  Okay.
[34:39.010 --> 34:39.750]  Yeah, Geoff, I think you're right.
[34:39.790 --> 34:40.610]  I think maybe that's not the way.
[34:41.190 --> 34:41.830]  Let me see.
[34:42.270 --> 34:43.350]  I think, unfortunately, we...
[34:43.350 --> 34:44.330]  I mean, I think this is the way.
[34:44.390 --> 34:45.350]  I think we want to be up there.
[34:45.450 --> 34:46.090]  I think we gotta go...
[34:46.090 --> 34:46.570]  I think...
[34:46.570 --> 34:50.090]  I think we have to cross this bridge back and go up again.
[34:50.090 --> 34:50.490]  Is there...
[34:50.490 --> 34:51.850]  Is there a way to climb down?
[34:52.430 --> 34:52.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:52.830 --> 34:53.570]  You face the...
[34:53.570 --> 34:54.230]  You face the thing.
[34:54.310 --> 34:56.210]  You turn around and you, uh, hit the grab button.
[34:57.410 --> 34:57.770]  Yep.
[34:59.730 --> 35:00.090]  What...
[35:00.090 --> 35:00.730]  What's the...
[35:00.730 --> 35:01.270]  Oh, there you guys are.
[35:01.330 --> 35:02.390]  Can I eat crisp berries?
[35:03.030 --> 35:03.650]  Yeah, here we go.
[35:03.650 --> 35:06.490]  Hey, if you come back to the tree over here, there's some, uh...
[35:06.490 --> 35:09.890]  Hey, the crisp berries were good, and then 1.1 for Geoff.
[35:10.270 --> 35:10.970]  Oh, shit.
[35:11.170 --> 35:11.810]  I'm getting poisoned.
[35:12.910 --> 35:14.070]  Yeah, that's what I just said.
[35:14.070 --> 35:14.790]  That's what I just said.
[35:15.210 --> 35:16.470]  Yeah, I just said that!
[35:16.490 --> 35:16.970]  Yeah, I just said that!
[35:17.170 --> 35:17.430]  I just said that!
[35:20.750 --> 35:21.230]  Gavin?
[35:22.250 --> 35:22.730]  Yeah?
[35:22.870 --> 35:23.350]  How's your health?
[35:25.510 --> 35:28.430]  Uh, the two crisp berries, uh, didn't do me wonders.
[35:30.970 --> 35:32.370]  Do you need this energy drink?
[35:33.710 --> 35:35.170]  Is that what heals poison?
[35:35.390 --> 35:35.710]  No.
[35:36.150 --> 35:37.790]  The poison eventually drops on its own.
[35:38.790 --> 35:39.270]  Okay.
[35:43.610 --> 35:44.570]  Good save.
[35:44.870 --> 35:45.150]  Thank you.
[35:45.590 --> 35:46.710]  Is this the berry that poisoned you?
[35:48.310 --> 35:49.030]  Uh, yeah.
[35:49.030 --> 35:49.190]  Oh.
[35:51.430 --> 35:55.930]  I want to help them, but also I want to get farther.
[35:57.690 --> 36:00.710]  Yeah, I think we should just keep going around here and working our way up.
[36:00.730 --> 36:02.610]  Oh, look! Down there is the suitcase.
[36:04.610 --> 36:06.670]  Yeah, should we do it, or should we just keep going?
[36:06.670 --> 36:07.290]  I'll give it a shot.
[36:07.710 --> 36:08.490]  Uh, hold on.
[36:10.070 --> 36:12.910]  Uh, Geoff, I might need a hand climbing up all the way.
[36:13.570 --> 36:13.830]  Okay.
[36:17.800 --> 36:18.160]  Okay.
[36:18.160 --> 36:18.400]  Okay.
[36:22.470 --> 36:23.430]  Oh no!
[36:23.830 --> 36:24.490]  Oh no!
[36:31.670 --> 36:32.150]  Control.
[36:35.850 --> 36:36.770]  There we go.
[36:38.990 --> 36:40.290]  Let me get my stamina back here.
[36:42.950 --> 36:44.170]  And then right, right click.
[36:45.190 --> 36:45.930]  Thank you.
[36:46.370 --> 36:46.510]  Cool.
[36:46.730 --> 36:47.150]  Thank you.
[36:49.930 --> 36:50.890]  We're cooking here.
[36:51.270 --> 36:52.650]  This is, uh, so far so good.
[36:53.510 --> 36:55.250]  See that luggage over there?
[36:55.330 --> 36:58.070]  That's the one that, there's one there, and then there's one right below it.
[36:58.110 --> 36:59.750]  I just don't know if it's worth it to try to get.
[37:00.330 --> 37:01.370]  Gavin, I've reached the luggage.
[37:04.170 --> 37:05.690]  Oh, we have bandages.
[37:11.750 --> 37:13.950]  Oh, wow. This has a lot of food in it.
[37:14.150 --> 37:14.310]  Okay.
[37:17.990 --> 37:18.350]  Gavin?
[37:21.190 --> 37:22.810]  I'm below you, below the bridge.
[37:24.810 --> 37:26.770]  There's airline food here.
[37:40.800 --> 37:43.200]  Did you just keep climbing up or did you end up...
[37:51.220 --> 37:52.420]  Are you by some trees?
[37:56.660 --> 37:57.020]  Yep.
[38:00.250 --> 38:01.950]  That was, yeah, I dropped half.
[38:04.390 --> 38:05.830]  That's, that's your lunch.
[38:11.030 --> 38:12.530]  How was it? Oh, I see you now.
[38:15.070 --> 38:15.710]  I'm here.
[38:15.830 --> 38:16.330]  Do you see me?
[38:16.670 --> 38:17.250]  Where are you?
[38:17.510 --> 38:18.350]  There you are.
[38:18.450 --> 38:19.050]  Hey, what's up, son?
[38:19.170 --> 38:19.670]  I see you.
[38:20.210 --> 38:20.570]  Hey, man.
[38:21.070 --> 38:22.390]  Hey, I got some bandages. Are you hurt?
[38:22.870 --> 38:25.910]  A little bit, but you probably need them more than I do, do you?
[38:26.410 --> 38:27.150]  No, I'm not hurt.
[38:27.270 --> 38:27.450]  Okay.
[38:27.810 --> 38:29.310]  I'll bet Gavin...
[38:29.310 --> 38:29.990]  What's his name?
[38:30.090 --> 38:30.310]  Eric.
[38:31.010 --> 38:32.350]  Where's, uh, where's Jarek?
[38:32.770 --> 38:33.090]  I don't know.
[38:34.130 --> 38:34.450]  I'm...
[38:34.450 --> 38:35.590]  I hear you better.
[38:36.730 --> 38:37.330]  Alright, hold on.
[38:37.930 --> 38:38.250]  Eric!
[38:39.230 --> 38:40.790]  Yeah, I'm coming. You're right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:40.810 --> 38:40.990]  See me?
[38:41.270 --> 38:44.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you didn't climb up, so I just started looking around without climbing up.
[38:45.970 --> 38:48.950]  Yeah, I think I just climbed left. I didn't really climb, I think I just walked left.
[38:49.090 --> 38:50.950]  No, we're, no, we're fine!
[38:52.730 --> 38:54.350]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[38:54.930 --> 38:55.870]  Are they above us?
[38:56.990 --> 38:57.510]  Or not?
[38:57.990 --> 39:00.450]  Ooh, do you think button mushrooms are gonna be healthy for me?
[39:01.230 --> 39:03.550]  I think that, maybe that's what I ate, that they were fine.
[39:03.550 --> 39:03.630]  Nope.
[39:06.890 --> 39:09.070]  I'm gonna go look for some luggage up here.
[39:32.320 --> 39:34.220]  Alright, you're gonna have to help me out again.
[39:34.900 --> 39:35.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.
[39:42.190 --> 39:43.170]  I'm waiting for you.
[39:43.410 --> 39:43.870]  I'm coming.
[39:47.570 --> 39:48.310]  Thank you.
[39:49.150 --> 39:49.770]  Hell yeah.
[39:50.270 --> 39:50.870]  What are these?
[39:51.810 --> 39:53.690]  Yummy, uh, yummy fruit.
[39:53.710 --> 39:55.910]  Ah, damn, it's the one that poisoned you, isn't it?
[39:56.650 --> 39:57.090]  Yeah.
[39:57.450 --> 39:57.870]  Fuck.
[39:59.830 --> 40:04.130]  I have two coconuts, but we have to break them, and they're gonna roll down the mountain if we try to do that.
[40:05.550 --> 40:06.270]  That's a good point.
[40:07.410 --> 40:08.870]  That's okay, we got some time.
[40:10.130 --> 40:11.570]  I'm gonna try eating one.
[40:12.450 --> 40:12.690]  Okay.
[40:16.450 --> 40:18.030]  It helped me, it didn't poison me.
[40:18.430 --> 40:19.410]  I'd never mind if it poisoned me.
[40:22.290 --> 40:22.690]  Brutal.
[40:23.190 --> 40:24.510]  Wow, what the fuck?
[40:25.370 --> 40:25.610]  Where?
[40:26.590 --> 40:29.210]  You think you're somewhere, and then you're not, you know?
[40:31.050 --> 40:31.610]  Um...
[40:32.170 --> 40:34.210]  I don't know.
[40:40.930 --> 40:41.910]  Oh, fuck.
[40:44.650 --> 40:50.850]  Ooh, I got coconut halves!
[40:56.190 --> 40:57.790]  Yeah, go for it.
[41:02.770 --> 41:03.050]  Oops.
[41:04.490 --> 41:07.370]  I need to get better at the start of climbing.
[41:11.530 --> 41:13.270]  We've climbed ourselves into a bit of a pickle.
[41:13.750 --> 41:14.010]  Yeah.
[41:14.950 --> 41:16.490]  Then we gotta go down and around.
[41:16.930 --> 41:17.650]  I can't tell.
[41:19.430 --> 41:21.150]  There's a bridge over here?
[41:21.610 --> 41:22.710]  Do you think we have to go down?
[41:22.850 --> 41:23.690]  Well, is that a tree?
[41:23.810 --> 41:24.510]  Never mind, that's a tree.
[41:25.870 --> 41:26.470]  Did you find it?
[41:26.490 --> 41:27.190]  No, that's a bridge.
[41:27.210 --> 41:27.950]  Is it a bridge?
[41:28.490 --> 41:29.290]  Yeah, I think it is.
[41:29.510 --> 41:30.990]  Hang on, I'm gonna go down over here to the left.
[41:31.670 --> 41:32.110]  Okay.
[41:32.950 --> 41:34.630]  Hey fellas, I see you!
[41:35.270 --> 41:35.710]  Where?
[41:36.650 --> 41:38.130]  Look up, look up, look up!
[41:38.590 --> 41:39.610]  Oh, they're way up there.
[41:39.730 --> 41:40.790]  Holy shit!
[41:42.130 --> 41:43.250]  It can't be done!
[41:44.190 --> 41:45.670]  Did you guys cross bridges?
[41:47.370 --> 41:49.350]  Uh, we crossed a couple bridges.
[41:50.410 --> 41:52.730]  It must be... yeah, it's gotta be over this way, dude.
[41:53.410 --> 41:54.490]  Yeah, I guess so.
[41:55.090 --> 41:56.490]  I think it's gotta be this over here.
[42:08.680 --> 42:09.120]  Yeah!
[42:09.520 --> 42:10.700]  Uh, don't mind that, don't mind that.
[42:13.080 --> 42:13.960]  I don't know!
[42:14.120 --> 42:14.580]  I don't know!
[42:14.580 --> 42:15.740]  I don't think I walked into the urchin.
[42:21.760 --> 42:22.580]  Why don't you try it?
[42:22.680 --> 42:24.580]  You can test a hypothesis.
[42:30.080 --> 42:32.740]  I think we gotta get to this bridge and cross it.
[42:32.820 --> 42:34.060]  Man, I thought we were being badass.
[42:34.260 --> 42:35.740]  Dude, I thought we were crushing it.
[42:35.880 --> 42:38.660]  I thought we were fucking crushing it and then they're just way ahead of us.
[42:38.660 --> 42:40.820]  Go left. Yeah, you got it.
[42:42.700 --> 42:46.440]  Oh, s'mores? Holy shit!
[42:49.320 --> 42:50.080]  S'mores!
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.060]  And a big lollipop!
[42:55.240 --> 42:57.300]  Gavin! I found a suitcase!
[43:04.080 --> 43:06.740]  There's a big lolly over here!
[43:19.520 --> 43:21.520]  Guys, look up to the smoke!
[43:28.820 --> 43:30.180]  Nick, I can see you!
[43:31.640 --> 43:32.540]  Who, me? Who, me?
[43:33.500 --> 43:34.480]  What's up, dude?
[43:35.740 --> 43:36.380]  Hey, man!
[43:37.420 --> 43:39.760]  I think I saw the others way down there.
[43:40.940 --> 43:42.540]  Oh, yeah, they're way down here.
[43:43.380 --> 43:45.080]  I hear them. You? You?
[43:45.160 --> 43:46.820]  Yeah, they're very distant, though.
[43:48.980 --> 43:49.420]  Yep.
[43:51.540 --> 43:52.740]  Good deal. Thanks, man.
[43:52.740 --> 43:53.400]  I'm gonna hang onto one.
[43:55.020 --> 43:55.460]  Eric!
[43:56.140 --> 43:57.400]  Yeah, we're coming!
[43:58.260 --> 43:58.820]  Okay! Okay!
[43:59.540 --> 44:00.280]  We found a suitcase!
[44:01.020 --> 44:02.040]  Ping it! Ping it!
[44:03.080 --> 44:04.140]  Wow, that's not gonna do shit.
[44:08.990 --> 44:10.190]  What did he say?
[44:10.390 --> 44:11.890]  That's not gonna do shit.
[44:12.710 --> 44:13.830]  I wonder what that was.
[44:14.310 --> 44:17.210]  He's trying to ping the suitcase, but the ping is so small.
[44:18.670 --> 44:21.450]  I think maybe we need to go over here to that bridge?
[44:21.730 --> 44:25.030]  I think so. If not, it's gotta be up this way.
[44:26.450 --> 44:29.070]  Feels like I could... You know what, dude? I could make the...
[44:29.070 --> 44:29.330]  Right?
[44:31.710 --> 44:33.490]  I found a rope cannon!
[44:42.620 --> 44:43.460]  Nick, look!
[44:45.320 --> 44:46.180]  What is that?
[44:46.280 --> 44:48.340]  It's a rope cannon. I'm gonna use it.
[44:49.220 --> 44:49.860]  Okay, shoot it!
[44:52.880 --> 44:58.560]  Oh, it's got a range.
[44:59.980 --> 45:00.420]  Oh!
[45:12.900 --> 45:14.040]  I'm almost to you, Gav!
[45:18.250 --> 45:19.650]  Alright, I'm gonna fire it here.
[45:20.410 --> 45:21.590]  Okay, let's give it a shot.
[45:25.110 --> 45:25.990]  What the?
[45:30.190 --> 45:30.630]  What?
[45:38.600 --> 45:39.900]  Can you do anything with...
[45:43.140 --> 45:45.040]  So, we've made a stripper pole.
[45:46.020 --> 45:46.480]  Hello!
[45:48.360 --> 45:50.700]  Hey, fellas! You got any ones?
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.740]  I think I've used that wrong.
[45:57.220 --> 45:58.920]  I think you might have.
[46:05.180 --> 46:06.880]  Yeah, yeah, you go up that way. That's good.
[46:10.820 --> 46:12.780]  Oh, it's easy. I shouldn't summon...
[46:12.780 --> 46:15.400]  Yeah, why would you even? You're out of your mind.
[46:18.620 --> 46:20.000]  I avoided them.
[46:22.700 --> 46:25.540]  Whoa! I hit a lollipop and I've gone crazy!
[46:27.480 --> 46:29.420]  I might have, like, super stamina.
[46:32.770 --> 46:35.090]  I got, like, monkey stamina for a second.
[46:36.530 --> 46:37.530]  Oh no, now I'm dying.
[46:38.910 --> 46:40.370]  Oh, did you fall?
[46:54.110 --> 46:56.630]  Is it supposed to be L-I-T?
[47:08.110 --> 47:08.750]  Famous guidebook.
[47:10.890 --> 47:11.410]  I'm coming.
[47:13.310 --> 47:14.830]  Hand. Right. There you go.
[47:14.850 --> 47:16.610]  Thank you. Perfect, man. Thanks.
[47:27.500 --> 47:27.820]  Now...
[47:28.760 --> 47:31.280]  I think we need to go over here.
[47:32.060 --> 47:33.020]  You wanna try to go up?
[47:33.580 --> 47:34.340]  I'm just gonna get a view.
[47:34.820 --> 47:37.820]  Yeah, try to go up one more time.
[47:38.460 --> 47:39.280]  I think we go up one more time.
[47:45.130 --> 47:45.910]  There you go.
[47:46.950 --> 47:47.450]  You're good.
[47:53.160 --> 47:54.680]  Uh, up one more time, I guess?
[47:55.220 --> 47:56.900]  Okay. After you.
[47:58.540 --> 48:00.040]  Trying. Hang on. There we go.
[48:03.970 --> 48:05.090]  Ooh, I'm lunging. I don't know.
[48:06.030 --> 48:07.310]  Ooh, I'm not gonna quite make it.
[48:07.630 --> 48:08.650]  I don't think we're gonna make this.
[48:09.450 --> 48:12.230]  Okay. What do we do? What do we do? Climb this tree?
[48:12.750 --> 48:13.470]  Uh, maybe?
[48:18.310 --> 48:19.190]  Yeah. Yeah.
[48:22.890 --> 48:24.270]  Yeah, that's it. Good move.
[48:24.970 --> 48:25.610]  Good thinking.
[48:27.910 --> 48:29.030]  It's still close.
[48:30.090 --> 48:30.490]  Okay.
[48:32.810 --> 48:34.270]  We're good. We're good. We're good. We're there.
[48:34.650 --> 48:36.330]  Thank you. Hell yeah.
[48:36.630 --> 48:37.170]  Hey, guys!
[48:38.210 --> 48:41.130]  No, no! There's a lollipop in it!
[48:41.670 --> 48:42.550]  Get the lolly!
[48:52.130 --> 48:54.950]  Hang on just a second. Let me put this in the, uh...
[48:54.950 --> 48:56.190]  Let me put this lantern in the backpack.
[48:57.150 --> 48:57.270]  Okay.
[48:58.850 --> 49:00.750]  Yeah, I got the lolly and the lantern!
[49:01.190 --> 49:02.650]  Okay, I have a lantern, too.
[49:02.970 --> 49:04.270]  Check out the stripper pole!
[49:07.630 --> 49:08.890]  I'll ping it.
[49:13.750 --> 49:14.190]  Sup?
[49:15.690 --> 49:16.990]  Whoa, there's a stripper pole!
[49:18.030 --> 49:19.690]  I put down a stripper pole for you.
[49:19.910 --> 49:20.850]  We're coming to it!
[49:22.050 --> 49:24.490]  Be there in a second. That's why I asked if you had any wands.
[49:25.050 --> 49:27.690]  Hey, have you got... the cluster mushrooms were bad, right?
[49:28.050 --> 49:28.550]  I think so.
[49:28.690 --> 49:31.910]  I just stuffed one in Nick's mouth and I didn't really find anything out.
[49:32.850 --> 49:34.650]  Oh, nice pole work!
[49:36.610 --> 49:37.710]  Now spin him!
[49:39.510 --> 49:40.670]  Put on a show.
[49:41.630 --> 49:43.670]  Wait, how are we supposed to...
[49:43.670 --> 49:44.190]  This way.
[49:45.610 --> 49:48.630]  Wait, so it's just...
[49:48.630 --> 49:50.950]  Gavin shot it and it stuck to the ground.
[49:50.970 --> 49:52.490]  I'm not quite sure how to use that.
[49:54.170 --> 49:54.550]  Oh, yeah?
[49:56.830 --> 49:57.310]  Crazy.
[49:58.610 --> 50:00.670]  Alright, we can light the campfire now, I think.
[50:01.410 --> 50:02.310]  How's your health, Geoff?
[50:02.750 --> 50:03.070]  Good.
[50:03.930 --> 50:07.230]  Oh, your character looks hungry, or is that just the design you gave him?
[50:07.670 --> 50:08.410]  I'm always hungry.
[50:10.050 --> 50:11.070]  Oh, no, there's sea cases.
[50:12.490 --> 50:14.790]  Alright, Eric's almost here, so we'll be able to light the campfire.
[50:15.110 --> 50:16.370]  We'll be able to light the campfire.
[50:20.690 --> 50:22.430]  Maybe he needs to be, like, 50 meters away?
[50:22.710 --> 50:23.730]  Is anybody going to eat his air lenses?
[50:24.590 --> 50:26.010]  We left it out in case y'all were hungry.
[50:27.970 --> 50:28.890]  Hungry? I can eat.
[50:29.450 --> 50:30.590]  All I have is this big...
[50:30.670 --> 50:32.250]  All I have is this big fucking lolly.
[50:33.090 --> 50:35.010]  Hey, morale boost!
[50:35.190 --> 50:35.510]  Nice.
[50:37.810 --> 50:38.250]  Cook.
[50:40.090 --> 50:40.790]  Oh, I cooked the...
[50:41.530 --> 50:42.790]  Oh, you can cook the marshmallow?
[50:43.090 --> 50:45.970]  Did you just eat it as is?
[50:46.170 --> 50:46.970]  I didn't eat it.
[50:48.190 --> 50:48.630]  Tropics.
[50:49.510 --> 50:50.630]  Tropics, day 3.
[50:51.810 --> 50:53.510]  So is this the statue?
[50:54.530 --> 51:00.130]  Wait, yeah, I broke it open and there was a rope cannon inside, but it just became a stripper pole.
[51:00.670 --> 51:02.510]  Okay, then you fucked it. Got it. Cool. Great.
[51:02.890 --> 51:03.910]  Well, you know.
[51:04.950 --> 51:06.930]  Right. Yeah, right. Exactly what I said.
[51:07.950 --> 51:09.670]  Guys, how do we navigate this shit?
[51:09.810 --> 51:10.590]  That's daunting.
[51:11.530 --> 51:13.350]  Did we just skip an entire day somehow?
[51:15.070 --> 51:16.610]  Oh, I think it went day and night, didn't it?
[51:17.010 --> 51:17.470]  Oh, I don't know.
[51:19.030 --> 51:21.270]  How do we get to this?
[51:22.950 --> 51:24.450]  It's like we gotta go down to get up.
[51:25.550 --> 51:25.870]  Nice.
[51:26.030 --> 51:26.870]  Can we use these vines?
[51:26.870 --> 51:27.910]  Yeah, let's check it out.
[51:29.130 --> 51:29.930]  What the...
[51:30.670 --> 51:31.970]  This is nuts as shit.
[51:32.630 --> 51:38.770]  Dude, me and Geoff were like flying up that mountain, then all of a sudden we looked up and you guys were so high above us.
[51:39.010 --> 51:39.330]  I'm going.
[51:40.610 --> 51:42.710]  Yeah, I probably got to the top of like 10.
[51:47.010 --> 51:49.430]  Me and Geoff are feeling really good about ourselves.
[51:49.570 --> 51:50.950]  We've been really bad about ourselves.
[51:51.530 --> 51:53.250]  I'm gonna see if I can grab this vine.
[51:53.710 --> 51:55.510]  We gotta go down, don't we?
[51:56.830 --> 51:57.510]  Oh, I'm doing it.
[51:58.130 --> 51:59.950]  Yeah, but look where it's taking you.
[52:00.670 --> 52:01.110]  What are you doing?
[52:01.470 --> 52:01.850]  Get it!
[52:02.130 --> 52:04.370]  Is that bad?
[52:04.770 --> 52:06.010]  Well, look at where it's going.
[52:10.290 --> 52:12.230]  I'm gonna follow... Hey, Geoff?
[52:13.010 --> 52:13.550]  Yeah, that's me.
[52:13.790 --> 52:15.330]  I think we gotta follow Nick down here.
[52:15.990 --> 52:16.250]  Alright.
[52:18.270 --> 52:20.850]  I think Nick has... I think Nick has the right idea.
[52:21.510 --> 52:22.110]  I think so.
[52:24.470 --> 52:27.450]  It's kind of hard for me to trust and believe in Nick, but...
[52:27.450 --> 52:30.390]  Listen, it pains me to say...
[52:31.210 --> 52:33.730]  I just thought you'd be able to climb around the spikes.
[52:34.810 --> 52:36.270]  I wouldn't trust it.
[52:37.630 --> 52:39.510]  I don't know that we can go under water.
[52:40.490 --> 52:41.310]  You should try that.
[52:41.690 --> 52:42.590]  It's water?
[52:42.970 --> 52:45.190]  There's water. Oh, I think it's water down there. Or is that just grass?
[52:46.830 --> 52:47.530]  Might be grass.
[52:50.590 --> 52:51.790]  Oh my god.
[52:52.850 --> 52:54.410]  I can't see shit.
[52:55.490 --> 52:56.730]  Remember being able to see?
[52:57.070 --> 52:58.290]  Remember being able to see?
[52:58.930 --> 52:59.690]  Oh my god.
[52:59.690 --> 53:02.170]  Do you guys think we can jump and grab the...
[53:02.170 --> 53:02.830]  I'm gonna try the...
[53:04.050 --> 53:04.410]  Okay.
[53:05.190 --> 53:05.690]  You good?
[53:05.850 --> 53:06.890]  Turn right. Right, right, right.
[53:06.970 --> 53:07.090]  Oh.
[53:07.430 --> 53:08.210]  Oh, what the hell?
[53:08.430 --> 53:09.250]  Got hands. What are you doing?
[53:09.950 --> 53:12.110]  I didn't mean to... Oh, thank you. You saved me.
[53:12.710 --> 53:16.810]  Alright, I'm just gonna try.
[53:19.610 --> 53:21.530]  I'm just going. I'm seeing where this takes me.
[53:22.590 --> 53:22.950]  Okay.
[53:26.090 --> 53:27.690]  Do you think these brown...
[53:27.690 --> 53:29.690]  I don't know. I grabbed one.
[53:30.290 --> 53:31.390]  Oh, my stamina.
[53:31.730 --> 53:32.830]  Oh, my stamina.
[53:34.370 --> 53:36.190]  Oh, this is gonna be a...
[53:36.190 --> 53:37.950]  I'm gonna drop. I'm gonna drop.
[53:38.910 --> 53:39.690]  Oh, you'll die.
[53:40.150 --> 53:40.370]  Nope.
[53:40.970 --> 53:41.490]  I lived!
[53:42.530 --> 53:43.190]  Did you get hurt?
[53:43.730 --> 53:44.430]  Yeah, a little bit.
[53:44.910 --> 53:47.410]  Okay, I'm gonna eat the brown berry nana.
[53:49.010 --> 53:50.770]  Aaron, can you catch me if I drop?
[53:51.370 --> 53:51.850]  I got you.
[53:52.030 --> 53:52.310]  Thank you.
[53:52.430 --> 53:52.830]  Probably.
[53:53.090 --> 53:55.690]  Okay, the brown berry nana, it can't heal you. It heals you.
[53:55.970 --> 53:56.890]  Oh, it's like medicine?
[53:57.010 --> 53:57.290]  For now.
[54:02.830 --> 54:03.550]  What the...
[54:03.550 --> 54:04.750]  Aaron, catch me.
[54:04.950 --> 54:05.810]  Gavin, come on down.
[54:05.910 --> 54:06.430]  You can jump to this.
[54:06.450 --> 54:07.090]  I got my hand out.
[54:07.490 --> 54:07.990]  Hand out!
[54:08.310 --> 54:08.570]  Ow!
[54:09.950 --> 54:10.590]  Oh, I got you.
[54:10.590 --> 54:11.170]  Sorry, I'm over here.
[54:11.950 --> 54:12.670]  Sorry, I'm over here.
[54:16.090 --> 54:18.450]  I'm trying to get us a little closer before we drop fully.
[54:18.710 --> 54:19.430]  Before we drop fully.
[54:19.870 --> 54:20.010]  What do you mean?
[54:20.770 --> 54:22.010]  We have to...
[54:22.010 --> 54:22.930]  Here, walk towards me.
[54:23.190 --> 54:23.690]  You idiot.
[54:26.570 --> 54:27.110]  What's this?
[54:28.150 --> 54:28.930]  Yellow crisp berry.
[54:30.050 --> 54:30.890]  Hey, check this out.
[54:31.030 --> 54:32.210]  Was yellow bad?
[54:32.850 --> 54:33.310]  Check this out.
[54:33.330 --> 54:34.170]  I don't know if yellow's bad.
[54:34.550 --> 54:35.070]  Green was bad.
[54:35.930 --> 54:36.510]  Check that out.
[54:43.750 --> 54:45.450]  I'm gonna grab the yellow crisp berry.
[54:45.630 --> 54:46.770]  If it hurts me, it hurts me.
[54:46.910 --> 54:47.810]  I'm just gonna give it a shot.
[54:53.650 --> 54:54.930]  If you're thirsty, just stick your head in it.
[54:54.930 --> 54:55.230]  Yellow's fine.
[54:55.610 --> 54:56.090]  Yellow's good.
[54:56.090 --> 54:58.290]  Oh, it doesn't heal you.
[54:58.330 --> 54:59.290]  It doesn't give you much, though.
[54:59.530 --> 55:01.330]  What is that thing above us?
[55:01.450 --> 55:01.790]  I don't know.
[55:01.830 --> 55:02.650]  I want to get it.
[55:03.430 --> 55:04.110]  Oh, look.
[55:04.130 --> 55:04.370]  Green.
[55:04.450 --> 55:05.550]  Some sort of thing, maybe?
[55:06.190 --> 55:06.830]  Go up!
[55:07.150 --> 55:07.590]  Go up!
[55:09.010 --> 55:10.190]  Some sort of thing.
[55:11.230 --> 55:12.210]  Oh, Geoff, did you get it?
[55:12.410 --> 55:13.130]  Let's see what happens.
[55:14.270 --> 55:15.330]  A red crisp berry.
[55:15.470 --> 55:16.050]  What are you gonna break it on?
[55:16.050 --> 55:17.310]  Throw it as hard as you can against the tree.
[55:17.590 --> 55:17.770]  Green king berry.
[55:18.290 --> 55:19.430]  Throw it against...
[55:19.430 --> 55:20.930]  Yeah, let's see if it'll break.
[55:21.950 --> 55:23.090]  Throw it as hard as you can against the tree.
[55:24.890 --> 55:25.290]  Nope.
[55:25.530 --> 55:25.850]  Okay.
[55:25.950 --> 55:27.090]  I think maybe just eat it whole.
[55:27.610 --> 55:30.190]  Oh, he's poisoned.
[55:30.250 --> 55:30.890]  He's poisoned.
[55:31.410 --> 55:32.150]  Oh, shit.
[55:33.070 --> 55:34.210]  And this is how we learn.
[55:34.470 --> 55:37.250]  By the way, this is how early mankind evolved.
[55:37.330 --> 55:37.790]  This was it.
[55:38.130 --> 55:40.590]  Yeah, we had to waste a few to...
[55:40.590 --> 55:42.790]  You watch Geoff die, and then you go, okay, nobody eat that.
[55:44.030 --> 55:45.230]  Geoff, you want it yellow?
[55:46.390 --> 55:48.450]  Geoff, you want it yellow?
[55:49.910 --> 55:51.350]  I'm okay right now.
[55:57.280 --> 55:57.840]  Red's good.
[55:58.980 --> 56:00.720]  Gavin's going up to the top, baby.
[56:01.340 --> 56:03.220]  I'm trying to get this orange coconut.
[56:03.600 --> 56:03.800]  Yep.
[56:10.070 --> 56:10.690]  Not for me.
[56:11.010 --> 56:11.590]  Maybe for you.
[56:12.390 --> 56:12.790]  Okay.
[56:14.510 --> 56:16.030]  Alright, I'm just gonna smash this open.
[56:16.270 --> 56:16.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:17.070 --> 56:17.470]  Okay.
[56:17.770 --> 56:18.550]  Fucking bitch.
[56:20.950 --> 56:22.210]  I don't actually need that yet.
[56:22.890 --> 56:24.510]  How the hell do I get past this thing?
[56:24.530 --> 56:24.890]  Oh, okay.
[56:27.530 --> 56:28.750]  Let's get that on her.
[56:33.310 --> 56:33.950]  Oh, balls.
[56:34.810 --> 56:35.410]  Oh, hey.
[56:36.490 --> 56:37.270]  How's it looking, boys?
[56:38.050 --> 56:38.470]  Medium.
[56:39.610 --> 56:42.290]  I'm gonna see if my stamina holds a little better.
[56:44.230 --> 56:45.010]  Geoff, no!
[56:45.530 --> 56:45.830]  Okay.
[56:47.550 --> 56:49.630]  I don't know if that's the way to go.
[56:49.890 --> 56:50.490]  Eh, maybe not.
[56:50.690 --> 56:51.030]  Probably not.
[56:51.970 --> 56:52.530]  Doesn't look right.
[56:52.750 --> 56:53.330]  It's working for us.
[56:54.930 --> 56:55.370]  Maybe not.
[56:55.370 --> 56:56.710]  I wouldn't say it's working, I'm falling.
[56:57.850 --> 56:58.910]  Working for me.
[56:58.910 --> 56:58.970]  Working for me.
[57:02.570 --> 57:12.810]  Oh, oh, don't touch the prickly bush at all.
[57:17.150 --> 57:22.080]  What was that, Gav?
[57:29.160 --> 57:30.520]  Who fell?
[57:30.720 --> 57:31.360]  Who fell?
[57:32.080 --> 57:32.420]  Eric?
[57:34.480 --> 57:35.640]  Eric down!
[57:35.980 --> 57:36.780]  Eric down!
[57:37.320 --> 57:38.560]  Guys, there's some fire shit.
[57:40.640 --> 57:41.740]  It's not good.
[57:42.120 --> 57:42.620]  Geoff!
[57:43.060 --> 57:43.560]  I'm very poisoned!
[57:48.220 --> 57:50.480]  I think that's a bee's nest!
[57:51.620 --> 57:52.420]  That's bees!
[57:55.340 --> 57:56.600]  Geoff, it's not looking good.
[57:57.340 --> 57:57.600]  No.
[57:59.140 --> 58:00.700]  I need to raise this up.
[58:04.160 --> 58:06.000]  This seems like a game Andrew would like.
[58:06.580 --> 58:07.660]  Andrew's gonna love this.
[58:08.720 --> 58:10.180]  But then we won't be allowed to play it with him.
[58:11.380 --> 58:12.020]  That's true.
[58:13.080 --> 58:14.340]  Oh, I found the bees again.
[58:16.840 --> 58:17.200]  Where?
[58:17.760 --> 58:19.340]  Oh, there's luggage back there.
[58:19.560 --> 58:20.000]  Oh, hey man.
[58:21.820 --> 58:23.460]  I see you guys up there.
[58:25.320 --> 58:27.000]  Watch out for the bees to your left, Gavin.
[58:27.560 --> 58:28.800]  Yeah, what can we throw at them?
[58:30.360 --> 58:31.580]  Ooh, good question. Let's see.
[58:31.980 --> 58:32.920]  Ooh, I got it. This.
[58:33.100 --> 58:33.600]  Throw that at them.
[58:34.860 --> 58:36.560]  Oh shit, Eric hit one of the things.
[58:38.020 --> 58:38.380]  Eric!
[58:38.860 --> 58:40.260]  That looked bad, man.
[58:40.260 --> 58:44.780]  Oh, boys! Oh, fellas! I can't see! No!
[58:45.380 --> 58:46.560]  Oh, did you miss?
[58:49.300 --> 58:50.320]  Eric, you blind?
[58:52.120 --> 58:52.860]  Eric's down!
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.540]  Geoff, you've left Eric behind!
[58:59.380 --> 59:00.200]  He's right next to me.
[59:00.240 --> 59:01.740]  No, he's dead! You gotta pick him up!
[59:03.220 --> 59:04.000]  I'll go get him.
[59:06.560 --> 59:08.380]  How do we get someone up once they're down?
[59:08.800 --> 59:10.580]  We gotta take him to the statue at the top.
[59:11.980 --> 59:13.240]  But I thought that was for the ghost.
[59:13.800 --> 59:16.480]  Oh. Maybe we can shove something down his face?
[59:17.460 --> 59:18.020]  His face?
[59:18.600 --> 59:18.920]  Yeah.
[59:19.820 --> 59:20.220]  Are you ready?
[59:20.400 --> 59:22.120]  Oh, I tried to heal him, it didn't work.
[59:23.240 --> 59:24.060]  Just healed me.
[59:24.300 --> 59:25.880]  Did it give you the option to heal?
[59:27.260 --> 59:29.260]  I mean, I picked up the... yeah, I don't know.
[59:30.860 --> 59:31.380]  Thanks, man!
[59:32.600 --> 59:33.320]  Oh, there you are.
[59:33.840 --> 59:35.120]  Oh, maybe I did heal him. Perfect.
[59:35.120 --> 59:39.300]  I don't know that you did, but it happened.
[59:40.140 --> 59:41.200]  Eric, you woke up!
[59:41.660 --> 59:43.560]  Hang on, you'll be back.
[59:44.320 --> 59:45.400]  Stop saying you healed me.
[59:46.660 --> 59:47.880]  He's alive because of me.
[59:48.060 --> 59:49.060]  That's not true.
[59:49.240 --> 59:50.140]  I'm like a first responder.
[59:51.660 --> 59:52.960]  Hang on, this is a good time.
[59:53.020 --> 59:55.120]  Geoff, first responder, last line of defense.
[59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.820]  Oh, there's a waterfall over here.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.720]  Can I climb it?
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.260]  No.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.000]  Okay.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:11.460]  But I can.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.700]  You think you can climb these trees, Geoff?
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.140]  Yeah.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.560]  Better than you can.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.040]  Okay.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.400]  I don't know.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.320]  Can you climb it?
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.080]  It's a little tough.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.380]  Gavin's in the waterfall.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.460]  Take it back.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.680]  I'm sorry, Gavin's not in the waterfall.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.640]  How did you get over there?
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.240]  I came up to the...
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.180]  Oh, I see, I see.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.020]  I see, I see.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.860]  Can you swim up the waterfall?
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.500]  Nick, Nick, up to the right. Nick.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.120]  I think it's... I think it's here.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.280]  I was gonna go down.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.820]  I think it's... I think that's it.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.980]  Oh, God, please be below this.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.040]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:11.120]  I'm gonna need... When you guys get up there, I'm gonna need someone to turn around and give me a hand, because I'm not gonna make it.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.580]  Oh, neither is Geoff!
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:13.940]  Same, same, same, same.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.540]  Geoff, Geoff, Geoff!
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:15.780]  Geoffrey!
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.000]  Alright.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.060]  Wait, can I do this from here?
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:19.620]  Uh-oh.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:20.420]  Ow.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.840]  Fucking dumb and dumber.
[01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:28.130]  I thought that I could be able to stand.
[01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.290]  You like that, Livy, too, huh?
[01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:30.050]  It's pretty good.
[01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:32.930]  Alright, turn around. I need a hand.
[01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:35.290]  Thank you.
[01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:38.190]  Hang on.
[01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:41.310]  Thank you.
[01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:43.610]  Oh, thank you, Nick.
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.510]  I'm not... I'm not trying to, I swear to God.
[01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:50.250]  Yep, thank you.
[01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:51.070]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:52.270]  That helped me like crazy.
[01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.150]  Thank you.
[01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:55.310]  Uh, control.
[01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:57.930]  Wait, how did Gavin get up there?
[01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:00.490]  Is it up here?
[01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.790]  Gavin!
[01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:02.810]  I'm in a cave!
[01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:04.770]  It's gotta be over this way.
[01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.970]  Yeah, I'm in the waterfall.
[01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:09.550]  I'm in the waterfall.
[01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:10.750]  Gavin, where are you?
[01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:13.510]  I'm in the spiky vines that crawled up there.
[01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:15.990]  You crawled up the spiky vines?
[01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:17.550]  I crawled up underneath them.
[01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:23.020]  You crawled up underneath them?
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.120]  Okay, it's gotta be this way, then.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:24.340]  Yeah.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.140]  Yeah, okay.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.280]  One would...
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:27.880]  Oh, that's bad.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.160]  Oh, that's bad.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:29.500]  That's bad.
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:30.100]  Pick me up!
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:30.460]  Get me!
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.300]  Oh, hey, what's up?
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:33.780]  Oh, hey!
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.720]  God damn it.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.080]  Geoff, you come through, I can...
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.300]  Well, well...
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140]  Hand, hand, hand!
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.400]  Oh, you're good, you're good.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.280]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.000]  There's definitely a path, but it's a very downward path.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.920]  That makes me nervous.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:52.940]  Oh, Nick!
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:53.760]  Oh, Nick!
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:54.820]  Oh, God!
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.360]  Oh, God.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.800]  Okay, I'm not touching anything.
[01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:04.950]  I'm coming!
[01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.330]  Hand, hand, hand!
[01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:09.590]  Thank you.
[01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:12.510]  There we go, thank you.
[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:13.510]  So, I'm not sure...
[01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.030]  Oh, what the...
[01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:16.050]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:21.890]  Piss cakes!
[01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:25.050]  To the right.
[01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.890]  Fuck.
[01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:28.510]  That's what I'm thinking.
[01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:31.170]  I'm getting hungry.
[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:32.410]  Yeah, I think that's it.
[01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:35.490]  Yeah, you got it, Geoff, you're doing good.
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.970]  Ow!
[01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:37.250]  Yep.
[01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:00.370]  We might be the best people to ever play this game.
[01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.470]  I think you're right.
[01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:11.370]  Is it?
[01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:13.130]  Oh!
[01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:15.150]  Wow!
[01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:17.390]  It's gorgeous, boys.
[01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:22.210]  The wrong way to go?
[01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:28.750]  I'm alright.
[01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.150]  I don't know where we're gonna go from right here, Geoff.
[01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.390]  I don't know how to skip right.
[01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:36.770]  I also don't know the answer to that.
[01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.830]  You may be...
[01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:39.910]  Can you just keep going right once you get up there?
[01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:41.330]  Hey, look.
[01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:42.150]  Yes.
[01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.250]  Oh, here.
[01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:45.350]  Yeah, you're good there.
[01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:50.310]  Hey, if you come over here, there might be an around.
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:52.610]  It's down a little bit from where we just were.
[01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.990]  Okay.
[01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.530]  Like, come up here and then have a look to the right.
[01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.990]  Holy shit, though.
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:58.650]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:01.150]  I'll probably just take it back out to where we were, but that's...
[01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.650]  You think so?
[01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:03.110]  How's that working for you, Nick?
[01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:04.910]  Uh, I'll tell you in a second.
[01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.550]  Yeah, but Nick will tell us if there's a path that way, I guess.
[01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:09.670]  Yeah, hold on one second.
[01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:10.570]  Just need some...
[01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:12.090]  Stam and...
[01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:13.410]  Oh, you don't run.
[01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.810]  Yeah.
[01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.910]  Okay, let's see.
[01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:17.250]  You can grab it if you want. Take it.
[01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:18.610]  Alright.
[01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:22.850]  Do you want the bad news or the bad news?
[01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:23.310]  The bad news.
[01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:24.010]  Oh, no.
[01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:26.610]  Alright, then...
[01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:27.870]  The bad news is I don't see anything.
[01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:29.790]  The bad news is it's really foggy.
[01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.430]  Yeah.
[01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:33.090]  So, like...
[01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:34.450]  Yeah, I think...
[01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:35.330]  No, no, we're above you.
[01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:35.770]  We're above you.
[01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.770]  We're up where you were climbing.
[01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.730]  Shit.
[01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:41.970]  Like, if you go straight up from where you are, Geoff...
[01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:42.390]  There you go.
[01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.030]  Can you grab me? I'm not gonna make it.
[01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:44.690]  Yep.
[01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.690]  Oh, damn it.
[01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.270]  Sorry.
[01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.010]  Go to your right.
[01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:49.850]  Go to your right.
[01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.790]  Here.
[01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:52.810]  Nick.
[01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:53.490]  There you go.
[01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.710]  Geoff.
[01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:57.110]  Thank you.
[01:05:57.290 --> 01:05:57.550]  Gavin.
[01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:00.010]  He's already moving ahead.
[01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:00.330]  Okay.
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:07.580]  Oh, shit.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.560]  Why did that hurt me?
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:09.600]  Did you drop pretty far?
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.960]  Oh, maybe you didn't...
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.100]  No.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:11.980]  I didn't think so.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.800]  I tried to.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.160]  So, which...
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:15.700]  Hey, look, Gavin.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.540]  We're back where we started.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:18.320]  Yeah.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.600]  How do we...
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:19.840]  Damn.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.300]  Sorry, boys.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.140]  How do you climb down again?
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:24.760]  Turn.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.460]  You gotta...
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:25.840]  Like this.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.060]  Yeah, you gotta kind of, like, turn around and, like, walk off and grab it.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.200]  Like, move forward into it.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:32.880]  Watch out.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.540]  There's spikes there.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.160]  I mean, you have something in your hands, don't you?
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.040]  Okay.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:40.800]  Geoff.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.280]  Did you have something in your hands or what happened?
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.540]  Well, yeah, but I've been climbing with the compass in my hand.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:47.800]  I just fucking fell.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.340]  Can we eat these bees?
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:51.640]  Uh, yeah.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.100]  Let's go try.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.140]  Yeah.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:54.720]  They taste like honey.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.260]  What if I shake the tree they're on?
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.160]  Yeah.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.440]  Yeah, go for it.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:01.740]  Ah!
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:03.620]  Oh!
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:04.240]  Oh!
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.200]  Oh!
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:05.960]  Oh!
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.900]  I'll get the honey.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:09.960]  Yeah, get the honey.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.420]  Can you eat it, Nick?
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.360]  Bee!
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.480]  Uh, no, you can't do shit with it.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:14.820]  Ah!
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.240]  Bees!
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:17.680]  Throw it!
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.240]  Throw it, Nick!
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:18.800]  Throw it!
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.900]  Pricks, I threw it away!
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.900]  Nick, you threw it at a bomb.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.860]  It split into a bunch of edible honey.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:24.900]  Ah!
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:25.640]  Throw it at me again!
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:25.800]  Gavin!
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.200]  Dude, Gavin's getting...
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.480]  Don't bring him over here!
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.340]  Ah!
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.580]  They're still on me!
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.760]  They're still on me!
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.220]  I'm gonna eat the green crisp fruit!
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.480]  Oh, I poisoned myself!
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:42.200]  I'm poisoned, I might die!
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:42.860]  Oh, no!
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:43.440]  Now they're on me!
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.440]  I didn't do nothing!
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.900]  Get the bees off me!
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.580]  Motherfucker!
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:50.980]  Guys?
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.520]  Oh, no.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.380]  Where'd the other two go?
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:55.980]  There goes Nick.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:56.220]  Oh.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:56.940]  Here.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.700]  Oh, no!
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:00.740]  Boys!
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.200]  I'm down.
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.700]  We're all in a pile, dead by bees.
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.100]  It's all...
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:10.660]  We're all dead.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.520]  We're all dead.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.460]  We're all dead from bees.
[01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.310]  Yep.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.460]  Ah, boys.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.140]  Fellas.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:32.900]  Alright.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.940]  Somebody resurrect me at the statue, guys.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.340]  Your body was never found!
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:44.180]  Oof.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.180]  Got a new badge and a new hat!
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.860]  Let me just put on my new hat here.
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.160]  There we go.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:56.920]  Alright, guys.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.740]  I got my new hat.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.200]  Savage.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.100]  Savage world, that was.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:00.860]  How's my hat?
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.680]  Is it cool?
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:02.620]  Pretty good.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.680]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.360]  Hey, does it remind you of the hat I got in Vegas?
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:05.720]  Hey!
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:06.580]  Yeah, it does.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.340]  It looks exactly like the hat you got in Vegas.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.320]  Well, guys, this has been Pete.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.080]  I desperately want to play this with Andrew, but also not at all.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.740]  I don't want to play it with Andrew at all.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:18.600]  So, um...
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.760]  Yeah, I want to watch you guys play it with Andrew.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.060]  Yeah, I want Geoff to play it with Andrew, 100%.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.440]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.560]  I really just want to watch the four of you.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.260]  You know what?
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.500]  This would be perfect for the heist crew.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:28.820]  Uh, no.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:29.660]  Well, I...
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.340]  I know that...
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.760]  I know how left out you feel with the heist crew stuff, Geoff.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.420]  So, I just...
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.640]  I want to give you a shot.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.060]  No, it turns out I was in all the heists.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.900]  I just don't remember it, so...
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:43.960]  I enjoyed it too, but I don't know how any of us are going to beat the second level.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:44.480]  Yeah.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:45.600]  We can do it.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.000]  We just shouldn't go down in the waterfall.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.020]  We just have to go somewhere else.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:49.020]  We just have to go a different way.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.720]  Well, guys, thanks for watching.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.020]  This has been, uh, Pete.
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.400]  This has been a lot of fun.
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.580]  We all have a cool new hat.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.940]  And, uh, check out the Patreon.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.980]  Check out the podcast.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.380]  Check out the other gameplays.
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.420]  And let us know if we should play this with Andrew.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.000]  Yeah, let's get him.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.020]  Yeah, let's get him.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.380]  That's pretty cool.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.080]  Hey, guys, I'm sucking Gavin's dick, just in case you can't tell.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.020]  You know what?
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.720]  I think my flight was delayed.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.000]  All right, we'll see you next time.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:20.280]  Bye.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:21.520]  Bye.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:21.840]  Bye.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:22.940]  Bye.
