[00:00.880 --> 00:01.280]  Ow.
[00:01.400 --> 00:02.500]  I'm gonna try to flank him.
[00:02.720 --> 00:03.120]  Ow.
[00:03.740 --> 00:04.600]  Oh, you're dead!
[00:07.620 --> 00:08.420]  What happened?
[00:09.100 --> 00:11.120]  He climbed the ladder and got eviscerated.
[00:11.280 --> 00:12.340]  Why did you do that?
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.260]  I was trying to get an advantage point.
[00:15.000 --> 00:15.720]  How? Did it work?
[00:15.880 --> 00:16.740]  I gave them one.
