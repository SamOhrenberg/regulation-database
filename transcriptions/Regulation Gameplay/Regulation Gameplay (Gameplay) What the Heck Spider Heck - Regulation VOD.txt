[00:00.000 --> 00:00.880]  We should be live.
[00:01.020 --> 00:02.360]  Chain together...
[00:02.360 --> 00:03.900]  I gotta update all that.
[00:04.260 --> 00:05.480]  Listen, I'm behind schedule.
[00:06.400 --> 00:07.560]  Well, you had to go to the bathroom.
[00:07.940 --> 00:08.300]  It happens.
[00:08.400 --> 00:09.680]  Yeah, you're shit ready for us.
[00:09.900 --> 00:11.340]  Listen, it was a...
[00:11.340 --> 00:12.480]  Oh, it was a whole thing.
[00:13.600 --> 00:14.480]  A whole thing.
[00:15.140 --> 00:15.920]  It was a whole thing.
[00:16.420 --> 00:17.280]  Are we live?
[00:18.560 --> 00:19.260]  I think we're live.
[00:20.440 --> 00:23.240]  Let's see if we're live by the scene if any piss rats show up.
[00:26.420 --> 00:28.400]  Yeah, can we get all piss rats,
[00:28.400 --> 00:30.200]  no corn rats in the chat today.
[00:30.400 --> 00:31.560]  Let's have no corn rats.
[00:31.560 --> 00:32.480]  Well, there's no Eric, so...
[00:32.480 --> 00:32.760]  That's right.
[00:33.540 --> 00:34.340]  Spider heck.
[00:35.040 --> 00:36.380]  We have no audio?
[00:38.360 --> 00:39.220]  No audio.
[00:39.320 --> 00:40.260]  Oh, it's really low.
[00:41.520 --> 00:42.220]  Okay, here.
[00:42.360 --> 00:43.800]  Let me try to adjust this.
[00:44.260 --> 00:44.960]  Andrew's got it.
[00:46.380 --> 00:47.120]  Listen, I got...
[00:47.120 --> 00:48.260]  Nick sent me a doc.
[00:49.560 --> 00:50.840]  What about this?
[00:51.500 --> 00:52.240]  Oh my lord.
[00:52.240 --> 00:52.800]  We have video, at least?
[00:54.460 --> 00:55.340]  Uh, we did.
[00:56.520 --> 00:56.720]  Oh.
[00:56.720 --> 00:57.580]  We back?
[00:58.000 --> 00:58.580]  Having video?
[00:58.840 --> 00:58.880]  Yeah.
[00:58.980 --> 00:59.500]  Yo, yo, yo.
[00:59.740 --> 01:00.360]  Yo, yo, yo.
[01:00.620 --> 01:03.780]  I can also just talk really loud for the next hour.
[01:04.140 --> 01:04.300]  One sec.
[01:04.380 --> 01:05.040]  One sec.
[01:05.400 --> 01:05.920]  One sec.
[01:06.400 --> 01:07.260]  Somebody says no video.
[01:08.380 --> 01:09.240]  Somebody says hurt Andrew.
[01:11.480 --> 01:13.340]  I wonder if I'm on the stream.
[01:13.620 --> 01:14.360]  Am I streaming?
[01:14.740 --> 01:16.940]  Somebody said Nick and Geoff are very low.
[01:17.220 --> 01:18.200]  Well, that's a problem.
[01:18.540 --> 01:19.960]  Well, that is, yeah.
[01:22.080 --> 01:23.040]  What about...
[01:23.040 --> 01:23.800]  What about now?
[01:24.560 --> 01:26.000]  Somebody else said no audio.
[01:26.800 --> 01:29.020]  Do we have video, at least, is all we heard.
[01:30.100 --> 01:31.240]  Oh, wait, somebody said...
[01:31.240 --> 01:32.100]  Oh, wait, they're talking?
[01:32.580 --> 01:34.060]  And then said you guys are too loud.
[01:34.440 --> 01:35.040]  I hate this.
[01:35.760 --> 01:37.160]  The audio is too loud.
[01:38.100 --> 01:38.660]  So low.
[01:39.340 --> 01:40.580]  Goddammit, I can't tell.
[01:41.040 --> 01:41.860]  What about now?
[01:42.460 --> 01:45.240]  Uh, I hear Geoff, but everyone else is so quiet.
[01:45.460 --> 01:46.120]  No mic audio.
[01:46.420 --> 01:47.400]  Way too damn...
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.060]  Okay, hold on a second.
[01:48.160 --> 01:48.740]  No voice.
[01:48.980 --> 01:49.500]  No voice.
[01:49.620 --> 01:51.680]  Andrew, scan your head.
[01:51.820 --> 01:53.060]  Literally no audio.
[01:53.440 --> 01:55.740]  Game audio means nothing if you can't hear them.
[01:55.740 --> 01:57.320]  Geoff is very faint.
[01:57.580 --> 01:58.500]  What about this?
[01:59.380 --> 02:00.400]  What are you doing?
[02:01.260 --> 02:01.900]  I'm trying...
[02:02.580 --> 02:05.940]  Listen, this was bound to happen.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.160]  This is a warning.
[02:08.460 --> 02:10.320]  Are you actually adjusting us on the stream?
[02:11.080 --> 02:13.800]  I'm adjusting in Discord.
[02:14.500 --> 02:14.740]  Okay.
[02:15.140 --> 02:18.100]  But you're not adjusting OBS?
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.260]  Well, I'm trying to...
[02:20.260 --> 02:21.840]  Listen, I'm getting there, Gavin.
[02:22.200 --> 02:23.660]  He's getting there, one at a time.
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.440]  I'm trying.
[02:25.060 --> 02:26.920]  Yeah, but you're adjusting us on Discord.
[02:27.500 --> 02:29.820]  I'm now adjusting on OBS, okay?
[02:29.940 --> 02:30.760]  I'm in OBS.
[02:31.160 --> 02:31.360]  Alright.
[02:31.520 --> 02:32.180]  What do you want?
[02:32.940 --> 02:33.740]  I'm sliding.
[02:34.420 --> 02:35.320]  I can be heard now.
[02:35.600 --> 02:37.660]  Now you can hear my bitching towards Andrew.
[02:38.620 --> 02:41.500]  Uh, the person who vocalized, they didn't know what they were doing.
[02:41.580 --> 02:43.480]  And maybe the two guys that have streamed before.
[02:43.740 --> 02:44.160]  We got it, boys.
[02:44.420 --> 02:45.320]  It looks like we're good.
[02:45.400 --> 02:46.060]  Hey, awesome.
[02:46.220 --> 02:48.360]  Alright, everybody stop chatting now.
[02:48.800 --> 02:49.820]  Video games are a mistake.
[02:50.540 --> 02:51.920]  Why did we make video games?
[02:51.920 --> 02:54.640]  We used to just be an audio podcast.
[02:56.200 --> 02:57.400]  Why did video games exist?
[02:57.620 --> 03:00.480]  Why can I put in an invite code, but not make a lobby?
[03:01.300 --> 03:02.520]  Connecting to a lobby.
[03:03.860 --> 03:05.100]  Oh, look at this.
[03:05.920 --> 03:07.500]  They say there's no Andrew now.
[03:07.740 --> 03:08.600]  I don't believe you.
[03:08.640 --> 03:10.040]  How is there no me?
[03:10.900 --> 03:11.980]  Can you guys hear Eric?
[03:12.040 --> 03:12.440]  Eric, go.
[03:12.820 --> 03:13.860]  I can't see the video.
[03:14.940 --> 03:16.080]  Okay, now Nick, you go.
[03:17.440 --> 03:18.660]  Alright, can you guys hear Eric and Nick?
[03:19.980 --> 03:20.940]  I don't think you're helping.
[03:20.940 --> 03:21.500]  How do I...
[03:23.340 --> 03:24.320]  What is missing?
[03:25.020 --> 03:25.940]  Here, let me...
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.660]  How do I...
[03:29.660 --> 03:30.600]  I'm sorry, what did you say?
[03:31.020 --> 03:31.320]  Okay.
[03:31.540 --> 03:32.820]  Oh my god, this is a nightmare.
[03:33.140 --> 03:33.440]  Okay.
[03:34.060 --> 03:35.440]  Do you know my sources so I can...
[03:35.440 --> 03:37.240]  Why are we the same spider?
[03:38.140 --> 03:40.200]  You picked this exact layout of spider?
[03:40.400 --> 03:41.960]  Oh my god!
[03:42.280 --> 03:43.700]  Did we both make...
[03:43.700 --> 03:45.020]  Are we spider twins?
[03:45.780 --> 03:46.260]  Dude!
[03:46.840 --> 03:47.980]  Oh my god!
[03:47.980 --> 03:51.940]  God, are you fucking kidding me?
[03:52.840 --> 03:56.560]  I absolutely picked my spider hat and body.
[03:56.660 --> 03:57.740]  Oh Gavin.
[03:58.280 --> 04:00.540]  I took my time, I looked through every single thing.
[04:00.580 --> 04:02.120]  I thought I'm definitely putting the cone on.
[04:02.260 --> 04:03.240]  I like this color scheme.
[04:03.600 --> 04:04.520]  Bam, we're twins.
[04:05.260 --> 04:07.280]  We are 100% twins.
[04:08.160 --> 04:09.300]  I hate everything.
[04:09.700 --> 04:11.280]  How do I move sources?
[04:11.620 --> 04:13.280]  You're streaming a black screen.
[04:13.760 --> 04:14.740]  I know!
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.700]  I'm trying to fix it!
[04:16.700 --> 04:18.220]  What do you think I'm doing?
[04:19.260 --> 04:20.400]  You don't think I know?
[04:20.800 --> 04:21.280]  I know!
[04:21.900 --> 04:24.000]  The audience doesn't see that we're twins.
[04:24.480 --> 04:27.100]  Who cares? I'm trying to get there.
[04:27.520 --> 04:28.940]  How do I move sources?
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.120]  I got a scene where the video works and a scene where the audio works.
[04:34.340 --> 04:36.340]  You're not allowed to be in charge of stuff.
[04:37.120 --> 04:38.600]  I said this yesterday!
[04:38.880 --> 04:39.680]  He did, he did.
[04:39.700 --> 04:40.900]  I vocalized this!
[04:41.120 --> 04:43.040]  You and I did not step up to the plate.
[04:43.040 --> 04:43.900]  You didn't say shit!
[04:44.620 --> 04:46.460]  You're not allowed to be in charge of stuff either.
[04:46.560 --> 04:49.420]  I'm saying from now on, we only stream when Nick's here.
[04:50.900 --> 04:51.300]  No!
[04:52.180 --> 04:53.400]  That doesn't work!
[04:53.640 --> 04:54.840]  He's never fucking here!
[04:56.280 --> 04:58.060]  He's eating hamburgers with those other assholes.
[04:59.360 --> 04:59.920]  Oh, there's video!
[05:00.940 --> 05:01.740]  Yeah, I know!
[05:02.640 --> 05:05.000]  I'm trying to move it.
[05:05.120 --> 05:06.980]  I'm trying to move it to the different one.
[05:07.900 --> 05:09.440]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:09.560 --> 05:10.460]  I think I know how to do this.
[05:10.940 --> 05:12.240]  Oh my God, perfect.
[05:12.440 --> 05:13.380]  Oh my God, loud again.
[05:13.380 --> 05:14.240]  Perfect, perfect.
[05:14.240 --> 05:14.620]  Are we good?
[05:15.020 --> 05:16.480]  Game is so loud.
[05:16.700 --> 05:17.060]  Better.
[05:17.340 --> 05:17.520]  I'm true.
[05:18.000 --> 05:18.640]  I think we're good.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.080]  I know this is awful!
[05:20.200 --> 05:20.600]  It's good.
[05:20.640 --> 05:21.120]  I'm aware!
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.940]  Andrew, it's good, it's good, it's good.
[05:23.020 --> 05:23.780]  We're good, it's good.
[05:23.780 --> 05:24.700]  I'm doing my goddamn best!
[05:24.720 --> 05:25.240]  It's good, we're good.
[05:25.260 --> 05:26.640]  How do we have a hype train?
[05:27.200 --> 05:28.600]  How is this a hype train?
[05:28.800 --> 05:29.540]  I don't know.
[05:29.840 --> 05:30.820]  We're going to hell!
[05:31.100 --> 05:32.380]  I don't even know what that is.
[05:32.740 --> 05:34.960]  How do we refund everyone and derail the train?
[05:35.240 --> 05:36.780]  We don't deserve the hype.
[05:38.400 --> 05:40.280]  Hey, somebody said...
[05:40.280 --> 05:41.260]  I think we have...
[05:41.260 --> 05:42.980]  Full blown something or other.
[05:43.120 --> 05:44.620]  I'm not sure what disease it was.
[05:44.820 --> 05:45.980]  How can you not hear me?
[05:46.000 --> 05:46.960]  Andrew, you're the fucking best.
[05:47.420 --> 05:48.680]  So, you got a compliment, Andrew.
[05:48.800 --> 05:49.640]  Mic up more.
[05:50.140 --> 05:53.920]  Gavin is the king of just fucking trying to poke holes in boats.
[05:54.240 --> 05:55.840]  I want to make sure we could use this.
[05:55.840 --> 06:00.480]  He's got nothing to cover the boat holes, but he's loving trying to put holes in that boat.
[06:01.380 --> 06:04.980]  We're out in the middle of the sea and Gavin's just putting holes in it saying,
[06:05.480 --> 06:07.620]  Hey, what are we going to do about this hole?
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.640]  How is checking that there's no holes making a hole?
[06:12.100 --> 06:13.560]  Maybe ask about...
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.440]  It's just...
[06:14.440 --> 06:16.020]  The boat is at sea.
[06:16.340 --> 06:18.720]  The time to ask about holes was before we left.
[06:19.060 --> 06:20.180]  I don't even know what we're playing.
[06:20.680 --> 06:21.500]  I'm dead, I think.
[06:22.480 --> 06:23.360]  I think I'm dead.
[06:23.440 --> 06:24.300]  I think whoever's alive...
[06:24.300 --> 06:24.780]  Who's alive?
[06:25.000 --> 06:25.620]  I'm alive.
[06:26.180 --> 06:27.920]  What game type did you want to play?
[06:29.100 --> 06:29.980]  We're doing...
[06:29.980 --> 06:30.620]  This is fine.
[06:31.740 --> 06:34.040]  The problem is you guys both picked the same spider.
[06:34.380 --> 06:35.160]  So I don't know who's who.
[06:35.760 --> 06:36.700]  I'm Geoff and he's Gavin.
[06:39.180 --> 06:41.020]  I don't think it's a problem at all.
[06:41.140 --> 06:42.180]  I think it's a...
[06:42.180 --> 06:44.040]  I think it says a lot about us.
[06:44.340 --> 06:46.720]  Oh, I keep getting killed by bananas or something.
[06:47.720 --> 06:49.740]  I'm trying to grab this club.
[06:50.900 --> 06:51.740]  Does this club work?
[06:51.760 --> 06:53.300]  Oh, fucking get rekt.
[06:53.360 --> 06:54.780]  I just double kill.
[06:56.780 --> 06:57.220]  Overkill.
[06:58.220 --> 06:59.220]  That was triple kill.
[07:01.480 --> 07:02.360]  I respawned.
[07:02.400 --> 07:03.220]  Okay, right bumper.
[07:03.620 --> 07:05.840]  Use right bumper to grab the weapon.
[07:09.500 --> 07:11.540]  So this is like horde mode, I think.
[07:11.620 --> 07:13.120]  I think we're just trying to get as far as we can.
[07:13.700 --> 07:14.400]  Have you not played this game?
[07:14.400 --> 07:15.080]  What the fuck?
[07:15.220 --> 07:15.400]  Kill me.
[07:15.500 --> 07:15.780]  No.
[07:17.380 --> 07:18.340]  Why'd you pick it?
[07:19.200 --> 07:22.460]  Because it's a single cam game that we haven't played.
[07:22.840 --> 07:25.020]  That's not the only requirement for streaming.
[07:25.020 --> 07:28.560]  We need to make sure it's a game we can play on stream, son.
[07:33.640 --> 07:34.440]  Another hole.
[07:34.820 --> 07:36.260]  Another hole in the boat.
[07:36.700 --> 07:38.780]  The boat's taking other holes from Gavin.
[07:41.380 --> 07:43.860]  Just look at a game and see if it's a single screen.
[07:43.940 --> 07:46.260]  It's not even really a single screen because it zooms in.
[07:48.440 --> 07:49.240]  Where's mister...
[07:49.240 --> 07:51.000]  Hey, remember yesterday, Geoff, when I said,
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.520]  Hey, maybe one of you guys should do this.
[07:53.580 --> 07:55.140]  And Gavin said nothing.
[07:55.680 --> 07:57.600]  All of a sudden, he's got a million ideas.
[07:57.900 --> 07:59.100]  He's got a zillion points.
[07:59.940 --> 08:01.380]  As soon as we go live,
[08:01.760 --> 08:03.360]  Mr. Ideas shows up.
[08:03.700 --> 08:04.480]  Ideas free.
[08:04.760 --> 08:05.720]  Free of ideas.
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.140]  I love that we're in an era...
[08:07.140 --> 08:07.880]  Don't even need to pay him.
[08:08.100 --> 08:12.760]  A regulation era where Nick and Eric do not like each other
[08:12.760 --> 08:14.860]  and you and Gavin do not like each other.
[08:14.960 --> 08:15.880]  And I'm just cool with everybody.
[08:15.900 --> 08:16.720]  I love Gavin.
[08:16.940 --> 08:17.880]  I love Gavin.
[08:18.020 --> 08:19.320]  You can love somebody and not like him.
[08:19.360 --> 08:19.760]  Trust me.
[08:19.760 --> 08:21.220]  No, I like Gavin a lot.
[08:21.600 --> 08:22.680]  I'm the Gavin guy.
[08:24.060 --> 08:24.780]  I suggest...
[08:24.780 --> 08:26.260]  Where are all these suggestions yesterday?
[08:28.660 --> 08:30.760]  Look, Andrew, Gavin didn't want to host this.
[08:30.840 --> 08:31.680]  Look at what you're going through.
[08:31.780 --> 08:32.940]  You think he wants to volunteer for that?
[08:33.520 --> 08:34.980]  I wasn't there for this conversation.
[08:35.160 --> 08:35.580]  I was there...
[08:35.580 --> 08:36.160]  Yes, you were.
[08:36.520 --> 08:37.960]  You were 100% there.
[08:38.000 --> 08:38.280]  You were there.
[08:38.820 --> 08:40.660]  He picked this on Slack.
[08:40.900 --> 08:42.560]  Originally, this was going to be Sea of Thieves.
[08:43.480 --> 08:43.760]  That's true.
[08:43.960 --> 08:44.500]  We're going to play...
[08:44.500 --> 08:44.960]  No.
[08:45.240 --> 08:46.620]  We're going to play Olympics, I think.
[08:47.100 --> 08:47.200]  Yeah.
[08:47.200 --> 08:49.420]  It went from Sea of Thieves to Olympics.
[08:49.840 --> 08:51.220]  And then I said...
[08:51.780 --> 08:56.120]  I said it would be better if we waited until we had an even number of players for Olympics.
[08:56.380 --> 08:59.960]  Because some of the games, like basketball, require even teams.
[09:01.440 --> 09:03.360]  And then I said I'd suggest something.
[09:03.720 --> 09:04.900]  And I suggested this.
[09:05.020 --> 09:06.420]  And everyone did thumbs up.
[09:07.400 --> 09:07.780]  It's true.
[09:08.240 --> 09:09.020]  This is all proved.
[09:09.480 --> 09:09.880]  I'm dead.
[09:09.960 --> 09:10.420]  This is vetted.
[09:10.980 --> 09:14.180]  You know, it's real confusing with Gavin and I being the same bunch of guys.
[09:14.200 --> 09:15.400]  It really is.
[09:17.800 --> 09:20.380]  Not even Nick with a name burn would fix that.
[09:21.240 --> 09:22.860]  If you return to lobby, I'll change.
[09:23.720 --> 09:24.460]  Or vice versa.
[09:24.640 --> 09:25.000]  I don't care.
[09:26.160 --> 09:26.820]  Return to lobby.
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.500]  Absolutely wrecked myself there.
[09:29.740 --> 09:30.460]  Thinking I was you.
[09:31.600 --> 09:33.500]  Return to lobby or did that just put me in a lobby?
[09:34.400 --> 09:35.260]  I'm not in a lobby.
[09:35.600 --> 09:36.140]  I'm not in a lobby.
[09:36.960 --> 09:37.520]  Return to lobby.
[09:38.080 --> 09:38.580]  I'm in a lobby.
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.340]  I'm going to go change my hat, okay?
[09:41.100 --> 09:42.240]  Gavin, let's not both.
[09:43.620 --> 09:44.020]  Here.
[09:47.200 --> 09:47.440]  Oh!
[09:53.150 --> 09:54.850]  You want increased voice audio?
[09:54.950 --> 09:56.470]  The audio is all the way up.
[09:59.150 --> 09:59.550]  Okay.
[10:00.030 --> 10:02.350]  Is there a versus where we just burk each other?
[10:03.110 --> 10:03.830]  Yeah, I think there is.
[10:04.310 --> 10:04.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:04.670 --> 10:05.610]  Let's do that.
[10:07.270 --> 10:08.690]  Geoff, did you change or shall I change?
[10:09.010 --> 10:09.490]  I changed.
[10:09.950 --> 10:10.130]  Okay.
[10:11.610 --> 10:13.630]  I can't believe we were the same spider.
[10:13.850 --> 10:14.910]  It's crazy.
[10:15.130 --> 10:15.750]  That is pretty...
[10:15.750 --> 10:16.330]  How many options?
[10:16.470 --> 10:17.830]  Is there like a ton in this game?
[10:17.830 --> 10:20.590]  Not a ton, but it's probably like at least a one in ten chance.
[10:21.050 --> 10:24.730]  Okay, do we want casual, standard, only blades, or one shot?
[10:26.890 --> 10:27.890]  Casual, standard.
[10:29.770 --> 10:30.570]  Those are two.
[10:30.810 --> 10:31.530]  Standard first.
[10:31.770 --> 10:32.250]  Let's do standard.
[10:32.450 --> 10:33.590]  Standard first, okay.
[10:36.610 --> 10:37.990]  We need at least two players.
[10:43.460 --> 10:44.060]  Send me out.
[10:45.060 --> 10:46.120]  Got in.
[10:46.420 --> 10:47.380]  I'm just listening.
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.800]  I'm just watching the audience fight over whether the audio is in fact good or is not in fact good.
[10:53.800 --> 10:57.500]  There could be non-Xbox network users.
[11:01.480 --> 11:01.780]  All right.
[11:02.580 --> 11:02.900]  There we go.
[11:05.780 --> 11:08.080]  Oh, Geoff's a yellow and green.
[11:08.560 --> 11:09.780]  Yeah, I'm a lime guy now.
[11:11.140 --> 11:13.560]  It's a brat summer spider.
[11:14.080 --> 11:14.460]  That's right.
[11:14.460 --> 11:15.160]  I'm a brat.
[11:15.320 --> 11:15.860]  I'm brat.
[11:16.520 --> 11:16.980]  Little brat?
[11:17.580 --> 11:17.760]  Yeah.
[11:19.180 --> 11:19.480]  Dang.
[11:20.780 --> 11:21.460]  Dang-a-bert.
[11:22.500 --> 11:23.980]  Oh, I'm gonna get you guys real good.
[11:24.000 --> 11:24.380]  Okay.
[11:24.840 --> 11:25.660]  Oh, shit!
[11:25.960 --> 11:26.320]  Oh, God!
[11:26.960 --> 11:28.020]  Oh, the blue launches.
[11:29.440 --> 11:30.160]  Give me this.
[11:31.080 --> 11:31.680]  I want this.
[11:31.900 --> 11:32.660]  How do I turn this on?
[11:32.740 --> 11:32.840]  Oh, no.
[11:33.100 --> 11:35.320]  Oh, I threw it.
[11:35.420 --> 11:35.800]  What a fool.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.580]  Oh, shit, I just threw it at myself.
[11:39.680 --> 11:40.960]  Oh, I got a sword.
[11:42.040 --> 11:42.920]  Get, get away.
[11:43.300 --> 11:44.080]  Get, get away.
[11:44.460 --> 11:45.500]  I'm coming for you.
[11:45.500 --> 11:47.360]  Oh, I got you.
[11:47.620 --> 11:48.420]  Sliced and diced.
[11:48.780 --> 11:49.800]  I was trying to go like this.
[11:50.180 --> 11:50.960]  I can go, oh.
[11:52.180 --> 11:52.660]  Shackle.
[11:53.920 --> 11:54.400]  Okay.
[11:56.800 --> 11:57.840]  Oh, oh.
[11:59.780 --> 12:00.260]  Oh.
[12:01.640 --> 12:02.640]  Oh, you got a gun?
[12:03.000 --> 12:03.720]  You both have guns.
[12:03.960 --> 12:04.180]  I threw it.
[12:04.360 --> 12:05.300]  Why do I throw it?
[12:06.080 --> 12:07.200]  Oh, shit, I'm dead.
[12:07.760 --> 12:09.600]  Yeah, I fucking blew you up.
[12:09.640 --> 12:11.100]  Point-blank range is brutal.
[12:12.600 --> 12:13.760]  How do you fire it?
[12:14.460 --> 12:15.380]  I'm not going to tell you.
[12:15.460 --> 12:15.960]  Oh, shit.
[12:16.400 --> 12:16.960]  Right trigger.
[12:17.240 --> 12:17.640]  Right trigger.
[12:18.220 --> 12:18.660]  Oh!
[12:25.130 --> 12:26.950]  I guess I was pointed at the ground.
[12:31.850 --> 12:33.310]  I guess you were.
[12:35.250 --> 12:36.030]  Oh, fuck.
[12:36.830 --> 12:37.710]  Holy dick.
[12:38.670 --> 12:38.890]  Oh.
[12:40.030 --> 12:40.470]  Slice.
[12:40.690 --> 12:42.570]  What does the time thing do?
[12:43.210 --> 12:43.810]  Oh, it's a grenade.
[12:44.010 --> 12:44.570]  Come in, Geoff.
[12:44.650 --> 12:45.550]  Come in, Geoff, son.
[12:45.710 --> 12:46.790]  Oh, my God.
[12:50.410 --> 12:51.130]  Did I win?
[12:51.450 --> 12:51.750]  I won.
[12:52.010 --> 12:52.810]  Yeah, you got that one.
[12:52.970 --> 12:53.030]  I think you may have won.
[12:53.070 --> 12:53.630]  The bigger spinner.
[12:56.790 --> 12:57.670]  Oh, shit.
[12:57.890 --> 12:58.170]  Okay.
[13:00.070 --> 13:01.910]  Oh, God, it's a bullshooter.
[13:02.350 --> 13:03.370]  I can make balls.
[13:03.950 --> 13:04.610]  Oh, get away.
[13:05.190 --> 13:06.150]  Oh, I don't want your balls.
[13:06.490 --> 13:07.310]  Wait, did I die?
[13:08.130 --> 13:12.050]  Oh, the backwards force from the shotgun blast blew me into the lava.
[13:12.570 --> 13:13.510]  Oh, that's really funny.
[13:13.710 --> 13:14.310]  Oh, shit.
[13:14.770 --> 13:15.290]  I just jumped.
[13:15.850 --> 13:17.550]  It is quite easy to off yourself.
[13:17.550 --> 13:18.290]  Woo!
[13:18.710 --> 13:18.990]  Woo!
[13:20.450 --> 13:21.330]  I went flying.
[13:22.750 --> 13:23.230]  Okay.
[13:23.610 --> 13:24.550]  Oh, I got to get...
[13:25.110 --> 13:25.530]  Oh, God.
[13:25.570 --> 13:26.070]  What are you doing to me?
[13:26.250 --> 13:26.830]  What are you doing to me?
[13:27.010 --> 13:27.530]  Get away.
[13:27.750 --> 13:29.190]  Oh, I don't know.
[13:29.390 --> 13:30.150]  What's happening?
[13:30.590 --> 13:32.350]  The freaking laser thing got me.
[13:32.710 --> 13:32.950]  What?
[13:32.950 --> 13:33.990]  The whole thing collapsed.
[13:35.590 --> 13:36.890]  Oh, I unlocked the hat.
[13:37.170 --> 13:38.590]  I unlocked the sheriff hat.
[13:38.950 --> 13:39.810]  So did I.
[13:40.070 --> 13:40.870]  Oh, got to draw.
[13:41.150 --> 13:41.310]  Whoops.
[13:41.710 --> 13:42.050]  That's funny.
[13:45.630 --> 13:45.890]  Okay.
[13:46.850 --> 13:47.650]  Oh, God.
[13:48.450 --> 13:51.370]  I need to hold on to the ground.
[13:52.930 --> 13:53.330]  Well.
[13:54.570 --> 13:55.910]  Watch out for that, fucker.
[13:56.550 --> 13:57.350]  Oh, no.
[13:58.630 --> 13:59.510]  Did you get me?
[14:00.810 --> 14:01.830]  I think you got me.
[14:04.150 --> 14:04.950]  Come at me, sons.
[14:05.930 --> 14:07.410]  I'm throwing a grenade at you.
[14:07.610 --> 14:08.050]  Oh, no.
[14:08.310 --> 14:10.110]  Oh, that was a pretty good lob, actually.
[14:10.250 --> 14:10.690]  Is this a grenade?
[14:11.970 --> 14:12.450]  Oh.
[14:14.590 --> 14:15.230]  Oh, no.
[14:16.830 --> 14:18.310]  How do I cook it?
[14:19.290 --> 14:19.970]  I don't know.
[14:20.510 --> 14:22.210]  Can I attack you with my limbs?
[14:22.530 --> 14:23.810]  No, Geoff, you suck.
[14:25.690 --> 14:26.650]  Oh, no.
[14:26.850 --> 14:27.170]  Get away.
[14:27.310 --> 14:27.550]  Get away.
[14:27.750 --> 14:28.230]  No.
[14:30.950 --> 14:32.070]  Get away from me.
[14:32.690 --> 14:33.470]  I'm a...
[14:33.470 --> 14:34.090]  Oh, no.
[14:34.810 --> 14:36.950]  Oh, my thumbstick flew off.
[14:37.030 --> 14:37.510]  Oh, shit.
[14:37.510 --> 14:37.570]  Oh, shit.
[14:40.050 --> 14:42.370]  We got one, two, three, as far as points go.
[14:42.410 --> 14:42.930]  I like this.
[14:43.570 --> 14:44.430]  I can't tell.
[14:44.570 --> 14:46.090]  Some people say the audio sounds great.
[14:46.150 --> 14:48.490]  Some people say the game audio is way too loud.
[14:49.390 --> 14:49.690]  Interesting.
[14:51.450 --> 14:51.710]  Oops.
[14:52.170 --> 14:53.450]  Come over here and I'll slice you in half.
[14:53.950 --> 14:54.510]  How about...
[14:55.950 --> 14:56.270]  Shit.
[14:57.630 --> 14:58.950]  Let's thread the needle through there.
[15:00.130 --> 15:02.390]  Yes, we will still be doing Sloppy Joes later.
[15:02.490 --> 15:03.110]  Nick will be here.
[15:03.490 --> 15:04.010]  It will be cool.
[15:06.410 --> 15:07.430]  Have no fear.
[15:07.590 --> 15:08.770]  Sloppy Joes will be...
[15:08.770 --> 15:09.530]  Oh, is that a nuke?
[15:09.590 --> 15:10.030]  What is that?
[15:10.250 --> 15:10.850]  Oh, I don't want it.
[15:10.870 --> 15:11.490]  I don't want it anymore.
[15:11.710 --> 15:12.170]  Get off me.
[15:12.310 --> 15:13.170]  Oh, you got to throw it.
[15:14.270 --> 15:15.770]  It looks like a nuke.
[15:19.130 --> 15:20.010]  Oh, shit.
[15:22.310 --> 15:24.690]  You armed it and just went into the lava.
[15:27.430 --> 15:30.870]  You essentially hit a nuclear power plant with a nuclear bomb.
[15:32.090 --> 15:32.850]  Oh, no.
[15:32.850 --> 15:34.890]  Oh, I threw it again.
[15:35.330 --> 15:36.970]  Oh, I fucking detonated on myself.
[15:37.130 --> 15:38.090]  All over myself.
[15:38.210 --> 15:39.950]  Just covered myself in me.
[15:42.030 --> 15:42.950]  Somebody says...
[15:42.950 --> 15:43.570]  Oh, I'm not going to bother.
[15:44.370 --> 15:44.750]  Get away.
[15:44.950 --> 15:45.050]  Get away.
[15:45.430 --> 15:46.190]  Not going to bother.
[15:47.890 --> 15:48.610]  Fuck me.
[15:49.110 --> 15:51.110]  I got double-ended thing.
[15:54.470 --> 15:55.850]  I battered it away.
[15:57.290 --> 15:57.990]  Where's Geoff?
[15:58.730 --> 15:59.770]  I died a while ago.
[15:59.810 --> 16:00.730]  Oh, I didn't know you're dead.
[16:03.690 --> 16:06.890]  Chances are, if we're playing a game, I'm dead.
[16:09.390 --> 16:10.230]  How do you throw?
[16:10.630 --> 16:11.430]  Oh, shit, like that.
[16:11.510 --> 16:12.750]  I think you just got to let go, right?
[16:12.870 --> 16:13.850]  You let go of the...
[16:15.050 --> 16:15.810]  From above.
[16:16.050 --> 16:16.910]  I'm not hitting nothing.
[16:18.710 --> 16:19.470]  Oh, no.
[16:19.550 --> 16:19.990]  The grenade.
[16:23.550 --> 16:24.430]  I'm arming it.
[16:24.870 --> 16:25.430]  No, I'm not.
[16:25.630 --> 16:26.650]  I'm just throwing it into the sea.
[16:27.370 --> 16:27.570]  Lava.
[16:27.890 --> 16:28.010]  Lava.
[16:28.310 --> 16:28.770]  What was that?
[16:29.050 --> 16:30.310]  Andrew left Discord.
[16:30.770 --> 16:31.110]  Is that a tie?
[16:32.850 --> 16:33.170]  How?
[16:35.070 --> 16:38.050]  He probably just hit a button or something.
[16:38.950 --> 16:41.310]  He's still playing, but he's not on Discord.
[16:43.210 --> 16:48.190]  What is that in the middle?
[16:49.410 --> 16:50.950]  God damn, good job.
[16:53.530 --> 16:54.510]  All right, Gavin.
[16:54.930 --> 16:56.610]  Does that mean...
[16:56.610 --> 16:57.270]  Hello?
[16:58.150 --> 16:58.930]  Now I'm back.
[16:59.710 --> 17:00.910]  You left Discord.
[17:01.730 --> 17:02.970]  Discord crashed.
[17:03.290 --> 17:04.010]  I didn't leave Discord.
[17:04.650 --> 17:05.750]  Discord left him.
[17:06.290 --> 17:06.810]  It did.
[17:08.730 --> 17:09.290]  Drill.
[17:11.030 --> 17:12.030]  This ain't a drill.
[17:12.910 --> 17:13.670]  This ain't no drill.
[17:14.070 --> 17:15.030]  This ain't no drill.
[17:15.210 --> 17:16.290]  This is a real event.
[17:16.290 --> 17:17.250]  I got a little shotty.
[17:20.550 --> 17:21.670]  Oh, wow.
[17:22.750 --> 17:25.790]  Who's got a lightsaber now, bitches?
[17:31.010 --> 17:31.410]  Oh.
[17:33.990 --> 17:35.590]  Oh, shit, shit, shit.
[17:35.790 --> 17:36.690]  Oh, you grabbed it.
[17:36.770 --> 17:37.590]  That was so cool.
[17:38.970 --> 17:41.350]  I fired a grenade and you grabbed it.
[17:41.990 --> 17:42.990]  I want the crossbow.
[17:43.950 --> 17:45.390]  So the game audio is still too loud.
[17:46.510 --> 17:47.950]  Okay, we'll just get rid of the game audio.
[17:48.710 --> 17:49.110]  Yeah.
[17:49.310 --> 17:50.110]  Who needs it?
[17:50.370 --> 17:54.090]  We'll just keep the music off and sound down a little bit.
[17:55.650 --> 17:57.510]  The sound effects are as low as they can go.
[17:57.830 --> 17:58.810]  I'll get rid of music.
[17:59.370 --> 18:00.470]  All right, so tennis.
[18:01.650 --> 18:02.950]  Oh, shit, I threw it again.
[18:06.230 --> 18:06.670]  Options.
[18:07.330 --> 18:07.990]  Oh, God.
[18:08.510 --> 18:09.610]  Oh, my God.
[18:09.770 --> 18:10.670]  Did that thing tackle you?
[18:11.710 --> 18:12.670]  That thing shot.
[18:12.770 --> 18:14.690]  I shot you with it sitting there fucking flying.
[18:15.250 --> 18:16.710]  That was such an undeserved win.
[18:16.850 --> 18:17.610]  I was upsetting the entire time.
[18:17.610 --> 18:18.970]  Andrew won by standing still, yeah.
[18:19.990 --> 18:23.710]  Oh, that was cool.
[18:28.550 --> 18:30.070]  Oh, fuck.
[18:30.330 --> 18:31.630]  I went right into it.
[18:32.130 --> 18:33.510]  I don't know why I lived.
[18:34.330 --> 18:34.770]  I don't either.
[18:35.270 --> 18:36.110]  I don't appreciate it.
[18:36.130 --> 18:36.650]  I'll tell you that.
[18:38.370 --> 18:39.810]  I got the dead space gun.
[18:43.570 --> 18:44.890]  You sent yourself.
[18:45.350 --> 18:47.450]  I just wanted to get away from you at the very least.
[18:48.030 --> 18:50.530]  Oh, that was so cool.
[18:50.770 --> 18:52.270]  That was amazing, Gavin.
[18:52.270 --> 18:53.210]  Oh, Geoff.
[18:54.790 --> 18:55.650]  I won.
[18:56.710 --> 18:57.330]  Def won.
[19:01.630 --> 19:03.450]  Stop changing game audio.
[19:03.930 --> 19:04.210]  Okay.
[19:05.150 --> 19:05.570]  That's done.
[19:06.390 --> 19:06.870]  Yeah.
[19:07.330 --> 19:08.430]  Geoff, it is what it is.
[19:08.530 --> 19:09.070]  It doesn't matter.
[19:09.570 --> 19:10.890]  The audio is what it is.
[19:12.230 --> 19:14.010]  And what it is is audio.
[19:16.330 --> 19:16.930]  Right.
[19:18.070 --> 19:18.550]  Right.
[19:20.070 --> 19:22.430]  Geoff almost getting slipped by the middle thing.
[19:24.770 --> 19:25.730]  Take that.
[19:25.970 --> 19:26.870]  Whatever that does.
[19:27.190 --> 19:28.890]  Oh, I don't like you guys with the weapons.
[19:30.410 --> 19:30.830]  Get back.
[19:33.710 --> 19:35.230]  Is that thing gonna blow up, Geoff?
[19:35.710 --> 19:35.930]  No.
[19:36.710 --> 19:37.550]  But I will.
[19:40.990 --> 19:41.950]  Oh, no.
[19:42.050 --> 19:42.890]  Andrew Penn's about to win.
[19:43.190 --> 19:43.850]  I don't like that.
[19:44.250 --> 19:45.070]  No, that shouldn't happen.
[19:45.790 --> 19:46.830]  What are we playing to?
[19:47.530 --> 19:47.910]  Seven.
[19:48.290 --> 19:50.290]  Alright, I need to get quite a lot more.
[19:50.790 --> 19:51.230]  Die!
[19:52.930 --> 19:54.150]  Oh, no!
[19:54.550 --> 19:55.170]  Let me out of here!
[19:55.730 --> 19:56.250]  Oh, no!
[20:01.340 --> 20:02.520]  That was awesome.
[20:02.880 --> 20:03.900]  Well, I unlocked a plunger.
[20:04.660 --> 20:04.880]  Yeah!
[20:06.480 --> 20:07.660]  Wait, you won the game?
[20:09.040 --> 20:09.600]  How did you?
[20:10.180 --> 20:11.040]  I killed two people.
[20:11.260 --> 20:11.940]  I got a double kill.
[20:13.100 --> 20:14.340]  Oh, you get points for kills?
[20:14.440 --> 20:15.180]  I thought it was a round.
[20:16.880 --> 20:17.400]  Oh.
[20:18.200 --> 20:20.440]  Maybe it was 6-6 and I just didn't see it.
[20:21.040 --> 20:22.040]  Oh, Geoff.
[20:22.700 --> 20:23.320]  I'm sorry.
[20:25.560 --> 20:27.420]  Oh, I really liked what I had going there.
[20:27.460 --> 20:29.480]  You just blasted it out of the sky.
[20:30.220 --> 20:31.220]  Oh, fuck.
[20:36.920 --> 20:37.960]  Throw it!
[20:38.700 --> 20:40.080]  Oh, you got it!
[20:40.340 --> 20:41.060]  Oh, no!
[20:41.440 --> 20:41.940]  Oh, no!
[20:42.380 --> 20:42.900]  No!
[20:45.180 --> 20:45.400]  Ha!
[20:49.360 --> 20:51.140]  So, no points for anyone.
[20:51.680 --> 20:52.320]  No points.
[20:53.820 --> 20:54.540]  Oh, Geoff, get it.
[20:54.860 --> 20:55.280]  What are you doing?
[20:55.480 --> 20:55.800]  Oh!
[20:57.860 --> 20:58.820]  From above!
[20:59.060 --> 20:59.860]  Oh, no!
[21:00.020 --> 21:00.240]  Get it!
[21:01.300 --> 21:03.740]  Oh, there is so much force that got into me.
[21:04.140 --> 21:05.520]  Geoff, my stick got a small.
[21:06.960 --> 21:07.900]  It happens.
[21:09.740 --> 21:10.780]  Oh, my God.
[21:11.720 --> 21:13.840]  You propelled him into that lava.
[21:13.840 --> 21:15.220]  That's a point for Gavy.
[21:15.620 --> 21:16.100]  Fuck.
[21:16.580 --> 21:17.820]  Oh, it's Gavin's wall.
[21:19.740 --> 21:20.100]  Fungi.
[21:21.380 --> 21:22.800]  Alright, what kind of gun is this?
[21:22.940 --> 21:23.180]  Shotty?
[21:23.680 --> 21:24.020]  Love it.
[21:24.980 --> 21:27.360]  I like that you can shoot other items.
[21:28.280 --> 21:28.760]  Oh, shit.
[21:28.940 --> 21:29.800]  Yeah, that is really cool.
[21:32.060 --> 21:32.780]  Kabir said...
[21:32.780 --> 21:34.960]  I take back everything Gavin said about this game.
[21:35.000 --> 21:35.540]  It's pretty fun.
[21:36.980 --> 21:38.080]  I like it quite a bit.
[21:38.660 --> 21:38.880]  Yeah.
[21:39.720 --> 21:40.720]  I like it more.
[21:41.380 --> 21:42.200]  I liked it when I won.
[21:42.700 --> 21:43.960]  I'm not liking it as much this time.
[21:46.380 --> 21:47.920]  I'm gonna go for a clean sheet.
[21:48.780 --> 21:49.480]  Oh, shit.
[21:51.380 --> 21:53.140]  Fight me on the pendulous box.
[21:54.640 --> 21:55.080]  Fuck.
[21:55.380 --> 21:55.520]  No.
[21:55.860 --> 21:56.120]  No.
[21:58.860 --> 22:00.580]  I couldn't figure out how to throw.
[22:01.280 --> 22:01.640]  Oops.
[22:02.140 --> 22:03.600]  Oh, you guys are breaking the box.
[22:03.620 --> 22:04.120]  We cut it.
[22:04.400 --> 22:05.240]  We cut the thing.
[22:05.340 --> 22:05.900]  Oh, shit.
[22:07.040 --> 22:08.600]  This is a real Jedi battle.
[22:09.460 --> 22:10.860]  I have the high ground.
[22:17.720 --> 22:20.240]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[22:20.240 --> 22:20.640]  Oh.
[22:21.920 --> 22:22.440]  Oh.
[22:22.920 --> 22:25.400]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[22:25.400 --> 22:26.720]  Oh, you got me.
[22:27.560 --> 22:29.000]  From the low ground.
[22:29.860 --> 22:30.520]  Who could have saw it coming?
[22:30.580 --> 22:31.680]  You got me.
[22:33.060 --> 22:34.840]  Calf your arms and most of your leg.
[22:37.840 --> 22:39.740]  Oh, that was a blow-up thing.
[22:40.100 --> 22:41.060]  I need tools.
[22:43.420 --> 22:45.460]  Andrew just got dismissed in this round.
[22:45.460 --> 22:48.040]  I'm just, yeah, I was like, let's figure this out a little bit.
[22:56.160 --> 22:58.240]  I can't hear them over my lawnmower.
[22:58.480 --> 22:59.180]  Oh, Christ.
[23:02.980 --> 23:04.140]  What is, oh.
[23:04.560 --> 23:05.000]  What do you want?
[23:05.080 --> 23:05.480]  No.
[23:05.920 --> 23:06.860]  What a shot.
[23:07.500 --> 23:09.600]  That was, that was real good, Geoff.
[23:09.800 --> 23:10.620]  Dude, thank you.
[23:10.660 --> 23:10.980]  Thank you.
[23:11.020 --> 23:11.760]  Thank you.
[23:14.680 --> 23:15.980]  Yeah, I dare you to shoot at this.
[23:19.640 --> 23:20.610]  I don't want to.
[23:33.520 --> 23:35.100]  You're good with that lightsaber.
[23:35.280 --> 23:36.000]  I'll give you credit.
[23:36.200 --> 23:37.700]  You could have been a real good Jedi.
[23:38.400 --> 23:40.140]  You're a real, you're a real Ewan McGregor.
[23:42.220 --> 23:44.380]  Oh, I got Ewan McGregor for you.
[23:44.820 --> 23:45.280]  No, I don't.
[23:45.820 --> 23:46.800]  No, I don't.
[23:47.940 --> 23:48.880]  Oh, Geoff killed himself.
[23:49.240 --> 23:50.000]  Oh, Geoff.
[23:50.160 --> 23:52.200]  Not yet, but I came pretty fucking close.
[23:52.200 --> 23:52.820]  Oh, shit.
[23:53.160 --> 23:54.180]  Oh, you're still alive.
[23:54.680 --> 23:54.820]  Yeah.
[23:54.880 --> 23:56.460]  I wasted my last thing.
[23:56.680 --> 24:04.980]  Oh, a little grenade celebration.
[24:05.540 --> 24:06.020]  I like it.
[24:06.800 --> 24:07.820]  I gotta get back in this.
[24:08.040 --> 24:08.560]  I gotta get a point.
[24:10.700 --> 24:12.140]  Nope, not this round.
[24:14.020 --> 24:17.140]  You're just splashing like you fell in a pond.
[24:31.800 --> 24:32.920]  Oh, shit.
[24:32.920 --> 24:35.440]  Oh, shit.
[24:36.500 --> 24:37.300]  Get back.
[24:37.460 --> 24:38.640]  No, you get back too.
[24:39.840 --> 24:41.440]  Everyone, get away from me.
[24:42.460 --> 24:43.020]  No.
[24:44.880 --> 24:47.540]  Oh, I won.
[24:50.160 --> 24:51.440]  We gotta stop Gavin.
[24:51.440 --> 24:52.920]  We gotta focus in on him.
[24:53.220 --> 24:54.300]  Oh, these are awesome.
[24:55.480 --> 24:56.000]  Grenade!
[24:57.660 --> 24:59.440]  Shit, I didn't arm it.
[25:01.280 --> 25:01.540]  No!
[25:05.320 --> 25:06.180]  Where's the high ground?
[25:06.720 --> 25:07.760]  Geoff, it's all on you!
[25:11.100 --> 25:11.620]  Yeah!
[25:12.740 --> 25:14.240]  I was trying to get that weapon.
[25:16.120 --> 25:17.360]  Alright, we're still alive.
[25:25.500 --> 25:26.420]  Is this fire?
[25:26.680 --> 25:27.200]  What does this do?
[25:28.300 --> 25:29.120]  I can stab.
[25:31.620 --> 25:32.900]  I'm going for him.
[25:32.960 --> 25:33.600]  What'd you get, you little bitch?
[25:33.940 --> 25:35.640]  Oh shit!
[25:36.260 --> 25:37.100]  Let's box him in.
[25:37.920 --> 25:38.780]  No, I don't want the box.
[25:39.920 --> 25:41.040]  I'm coming with the box!
[25:42.220 --> 25:43.060]  Give me this.
[25:43.840 --> 25:45.640]  Oh no, you blew it up!
[25:46.180 --> 25:47.700]  Oh shit, I blew up the weapons!
[25:47.700 --> 25:48.360]  Oh!
[25:55.980 --> 25:56.460]  Oh!
[25:56.680 --> 25:57.440]  Thank you!
[25:59.660 --> 26:01.660]  That was a pretty epic battle
[26:01.660 --> 26:02.860]  until we both didn't realize
[26:02.860 --> 26:04.060]  the ground was rising.
[26:07.640 --> 26:09.180]  This game is insane.
[26:09.340 --> 26:10.080]  Oh shit, I'm sorry, Andrew.
[26:10.360 --> 26:10.840]  That's okay.
[26:12.440 --> 26:13.780]  Are you idiots teaming up?
[26:14.340 --> 26:15.760]  Oh absolutely, we are. You're one away.
[26:18.600 --> 26:19.220]  God damn it!
[26:19.220 --> 26:19.940]  Stay alive, baby!
[26:20.900 --> 26:21.640]  Oh, fuck.
[26:22.700 --> 26:24.000]  I gotta get off the floor.
[26:26.440 --> 26:26.960]  Give me that.
[26:27.040 --> 26:28.260]  Give me that sabre.
[26:31.540 --> 26:32.780]  Ha, yeah!
[26:33.920 --> 26:34.400]  Nice.
[26:34.400 --> 26:37.120]  That was a complete accident, but I'll take it.
[26:38.980 --> 26:40.860]  Offer you Geoff with the high ground!
[26:41.900 --> 26:42.080]  Bah!
[26:42.900 --> 26:43.400]  Bah!
[26:44.960 --> 26:45.760]  Oh no!
[26:45.760 --> 26:45.820]  No!
[26:48.640 --> 26:49.480]  Did a weapon
[26:49.480 --> 26:50.600]  fall on top of me?
[26:52.120 --> 26:53.760]  Oh, that's so funny.
[26:55.560 --> 26:56.720]  Oh, I got another one of these.
[26:59.720 --> 26:59.880]  Oh.
[27:01.740 --> 27:03.120]  There we go, okay.
[27:04.160 --> 27:04.920]  Damn, we are quiet.
[27:05.700 --> 27:06.380]  I don't like that.
[27:10.600 --> 27:10.960]  Oh shit!
[27:14.480 --> 27:15.360]  Oh no!
[27:15.360 --> 27:16.380]  Oh shit!
[27:19.860 --> 27:21.700]  Oh! I went flying!
[27:22.500 --> 27:23.000]  Oh god.
[27:24.540 --> 27:25.300]  Stop!
[27:25.860 --> 27:26.740]  Oh, where's my weapon?
[27:27.180 --> 27:27.780]  I need a weapon!
[27:29.500 --> 27:29.560]  Oh!
[27:31.060 --> 27:31.820]  Ah!
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.000]  Oh! No!
[27:36.160 --> 27:36.720]  Oh!
[27:36.840 --> 27:39.020]  Oh god, dude.
[27:39.120 --> 27:40.080]  That is intense.
[27:41.380 --> 27:42.720]  Oh, this is fun.
[27:43.560 --> 27:44.360]  I like this.
[27:45.080 --> 27:45.260]  Yeah.
[27:48.620 --> 27:49.460]  Had a...
[27:49.460 --> 27:50.620]  Had a delivery.
[27:50.900 --> 27:51.240]  Oh no!
[27:52.020 --> 27:53.020]  Get me off this thing!
[27:55.340 --> 27:56.160]  It's all on you, Geoff.
[27:57.840 --> 27:58.680]  It's all on you.
[27:58.840 --> 27:58.900]  Get up!
[28:02.460 --> 28:03.060]  What's this?
[28:04.000 --> 28:04.920]  What do I need to do with this?
[28:07.580 --> 28:08.360]  Nothing, apparently.
[28:08.620 --> 28:10.060]  Oh my god.
[28:10.940 --> 28:12.060]  Congratulations, Gavin.
[28:12.600 --> 28:13.740]  Alright, so that's one to Geoff.
[28:13.980 --> 28:14.820]  One to me.
[28:16.680 --> 28:17.460]  That's one-one.
[28:17.880 --> 28:19.480]  One-one. O.
[28:20.720 --> 28:22.020]  Where O stands for zero.
[28:22.500 --> 28:23.140]  The absence of a one.
[28:23.160 --> 28:25.420]  I'm doing better than the audio, so I feel good about that.
[28:26.320 --> 28:27.220]  I'm winning there.
[28:29.660 --> 28:31.020]  Oh my god.
[28:31.220 --> 28:32.360]  That just worked.
[28:32.900 --> 28:34.320]  That sucked.
[28:35.620 --> 28:36.100]  Oops!
[28:36.100 --> 28:36.400]  Oops!
[28:38.340 --> 28:40.060]  Somebody asked if Chain Together doesn't work.
[28:40.240 --> 28:42.260]  Yeah, but Chain Together would play four-player.
[28:42.660 --> 28:44.540]  Although I think we talked about it, audience,
[28:44.800 --> 28:46.360]  and we decided that I think we're gonna
[28:46.360 --> 28:48.020]  stream it some more.
[28:48.420 --> 28:49.480]  Right? We discussed that?
[28:51.580 --> 28:54.740]  Do checkpoints so that we can see what's after the first 30 minutes.
[28:55.340 --> 28:56.920]  I was seeing how long I could cook for.
[28:58.380 --> 28:59.480]  Get away, get away, get away.
[29:00.040 --> 29:01.260]  Oh god, I did!
[29:01.560 --> 29:03.860]  Wow! How did you do that?
[29:03.860 --> 29:05.180]  I didn't make it fly.
[29:05.380 --> 29:06.380]  The weapons, yeah.
[29:07.120 --> 29:07.600]  Jesus.
[29:09.180 --> 29:10.400]  What do we got?
[29:12.060 --> 29:13.440]  What is that? Holy Hand Grenade?
[29:13.940 --> 29:15.780]  I don't know, but I just told you!
[29:18.780 --> 29:19.800]  Oh, you guys are on?
[29:20.180 --> 29:20.660]  Oh!
[29:21.380 --> 29:22.840]  Dude, high ground actually
[29:22.840 --> 29:25.040]  actually helps out.
[29:25.600 --> 29:27.600]  It really does. It really does.
[29:30.020 --> 29:31.900]  Somebody said they'll always believe in Geoff. Why?
[29:32.600 --> 29:33.640]  Oops, oops, oops, oops.
[29:34.280 --> 29:36.000]  Oh my god, I'm so
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.040]  thick. Get away, get away, get away,
[29:38.060 --> 29:39.700]  get away, I don't like it, I don't like your sword.
[29:40.540 --> 29:41.920]  I did win the first time,
[29:42.000 --> 29:42.320]  I guess.
[29:43.580 --> 29:43.980]  Oh!
[29:49.920 --> 29:50.900]  I'm getting some points.
[29:55.880 --> 29:57.200]  Is this gonna go?
[29:57.420 --> 29:59.160]  I don't know.
[29:59.160 --> 30:00.120]  Oh dear.
[30:00.540 --> 30:01.300]  Get off my thing.
[30:03.160 --> 30:03.680]  Whoops.
[30:05.860 --> 30:06.300]  Give me the weapon.
[30:07.740 --> 30:08.260]  No!
[30:09.980 --> 30:11.240]  Do I wanna be in this
[30:11.240 --> 30:12.020]  spring thing?
[30:12.580 --> 30:14.140]  Oh, you get some air.
[30:14.320 --> 30:17.140]  Looks like you got a ninja star up there.
[30:20.180 --> 30:20.700]  Whoops.
[30:23.140 --> 30:25.720]  Oh my god, I fell so fast.
[30:25.780 --> 30:27.620]  Olympic dive right into the lava.
[30:28.320 --> 30:29.520]  Well that was easy,
[30:29.580 --> 30:30.900]  I just had to not
[30:31.540 --> 30:32.480]  outlast you idiots.
[30:39.620 --> 30:41.640]  I don't know how this works.
[30:42.500 --> 30:43.340]  Oh my god!
[30:43.680 --> 30:45.240]  Let me catch it.
[30:45.940 --> 30:47.480]  Oh no, get away!
[30:48.340 --> 30:49.300]  Oh shit!
[30:49.960 --> 30:51.560]  We're just giving them to Geoff.
[30:52.740 --> 30:53.880]  He's on a roll.
[30:57.620 --> 30:57.940]  Hey.
[31:00.660 --> 31:01.300]  Oops.
[31:01.680 --> 31:02.040]  Oh.
[31:03.140 --> 31:04.360]  I didn't do anything.
[31:05.560 --> 31:07.480]  How does the hammer...
[31:07.480 --> 31:09.480]  Oh shit, the whole outline.
[31:09.760 --> 31:10.780]  It's all bad.
[31:12.500 --> 31:13.580]  There's nothing worse than just
[31:13.580 --> 31:14.600]  dribbling off.
[31:15.060 --> 31:16.360]  Yeah, it's so disappointing.
[31:20.320 --> 31:20.960]  Okay.
[31:21.520 --> 31:22.280]  Give me the stuff.
[31:23.960 --> 31:25.580]  I don't know if I want this grenade.
[31:25.580 --> 31:27.920]  Oh god.
[31:28.380 --> 31:29.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:29.560 --> 31:31.420]  Yeah, yeah, land on him.
[31:31.500 --> 31:33.160]  No, no, no.
[31:33.480 --> 31:37.780]  I blew myself up!
[31:41.780 --> 31:43.460]  Geoff with five in a row.
[31:43.980 --> 31:45.120]  Geoff's winning by standing.
[31:46.600 --> 31:48.620]  I killed somebody in that one.
[31:50.880 --> 31:51.400]  Oh!
[31:51.600 --> 31:52.760]  I was so close!
[31:52.760 --> 31:54.480]  You ain't getting this one!
[31:54.540 --> 31:55.460]  Like a millimeter.
[31:56.220 --> 31:58.400]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[31:58.480 --> 31:58.960]  That was awesome.
[32:01.020 --> 32:02.340]  You're so glad we
[32:02.340 --> 32:04.560]  play this game. The people make another great
[32:04.560 --> 32:06.000]  comic called Stick Fight the game.
[32:06.080 --> 32:07.180]  Oh yeah, I remember Stick Fight.
[32:08.700 --> 32:09.880]  I want the gun.
[32:11.600 --> 32:12.520]  Oh, I don't want this.
[32:15.440 --> 32:18.680]  Oh, what a shitty and suck face.
[32:20.040 --> 32:20.340]  Oh,
[32:20.340 --> 32:22.080]  whoever subscribed, thank you very much.
[32:22.380 --> 32:23.400]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[32:24.360 --> 32:26.180]  It's hard for us to see, but
[32:26.180 --> 32:27.440]  it doesn't mean we don't appreciate it.
[32:27.600 --> 32:29.500]  No, very much appreciate it.
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.480]  Where am I? What am I doing? Ah, I was looking at the wrong character.
[32:33.840 --> 32:34.780]  Are you looking at me?
[32:35.080 --> 32:37.460]  Yeah, he's having a double take on both of us.
[32:37.480 --> 32:37.840]  Maybe.
[32:40.880 --> 32:41.220]  Whoops!
[32:47.240 --> 32:48.400]  No! That was...
[32:48.400 --> 32:49.280]  I wanted that!
[32:49.280 --> 32:51.000]  That was so cool.
[32:52.000 --> 32:52.960]  Come here Geoff!
[32:53.220 --> 32:53.500]  Oh!
[32:54.680 --> 32:55.760]  What a kill!
[32:57.700 --> 32:59.720]  You just bounced him off.
[33:01.040 --> 33:02.720]  What did you do to me?
[33:07.060 --> 33:08.360]  That was awesome.
[33:08.600 --> 33:10.080]  Fuck, fuck.
[33:10.640 --> 33:12.080]  I just want this weapon.
[33:14.920 --> 33:15.440]  Oh!
[33:17.100 --> 33:18.860]  That was so close.
[33:21.680 --> 33:22.720]  What a...
[33:22.720 --> 33:23.120]  No!
[33:24.880 --> 33:25.400]  Yes!
[33:25.600 --> 33:26.720]  You killed me though.
[33:29.220 --> 33:30.440]  Geoff is one point away.
[33:30.480 --> 33:31.560]  We gotta focus in on Geoff.
[33:31.740 --> 33:32.360]  Alright, let's focus.
[33:32.620 --> 33:33.400]  He's sneaky about this.
[33:35.820 --> 33:36.720]  Where am I?
[33:37.200 --> 33:39.200]  Alright, Geoff.
[33:39.960 --> 33:40.800]  Easy does it.
[33:40.800 --> 33:42.660]  Oh, Gavin!
[33:43.700 --> 33:44.260]  Gavin!
[33:45.200 --> 33:46.220]  Thank you.
[33:46.580 --> 33:47.760]  We killed each other!
[33:48.480 --> 33:48.980]  Why?
[33:50.600 --> 33:53.100]  We just jumped into each other.
[33:53.700 --> 33:58.020]  Hey, Crackler said it's the first time he's ever caught a regulation stream.
[33:58.260 --> 34:01.240]  How about a regulation welcome the fuck to the stream, Crackler?
[34:02.940 --> 34:03.320]  Welcome!
[34:03.320 --> 34:03.880]  Geoff peacefully winning.
[34:04.260 --> 34:06.400]  It's typically more organized than this.
[34:06.620 --> 34:10.040]  This one's a shit show, but sometimes there's like an 80% chance that it won't be.
[34:10.820 --> 34:11.260]  Oh!
[34:11.920 --> 34:14.380]  Should we try one of the...
[34:14.380 --> 34:15.360]  Is there like a running one?
[34:16.140 --> 34:17.300]  Like a navigating one?
[34:17.840 --> 34:19.200]  There is, but I don't think that's multiplayer.
[34:20.400 --> 34:21.720]  That's what I wanted to do.
[34:22.400 --> 34:23.900]  Like a speedrunner's type?
[34:23.960 --> 34:24.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:26.320 --> 34:27.900]  Yeah, there's like
[34:27.900 --> 34:28.900]  horde mode and stuff.
[34:31.100 --> 34:31.840]  Alright, so that's
[34:31.840 --> 34:33.640]  2-1-0.
[34:35.340 --> 34:35.780]  To Geoff.
[34:36.340 --> 34:36.700]  No!
[34:36.700 --> 34:38.860]  Oh, I got a tire!
[34:39.200 --> 34:40.360]  Oh, you little fucker.
[34:40.780 --> 34:41.420]  You got a saw blade.
[34:42.980 --> 34:44.300]  Oh god, that hit me.
[34:44.920 --> 34:45.400]  Stop it.
[34:45.540 --> 34:47.780]  I like being dead because then I can look at the chat.
[34:47.900 --> 34:50.220]  Thank you, Dysilver13.
[34:50.940 --> 34:51.320]  I guess.
[34:53.080 --> 34:54.620]  Mymulletman gave us some piss rats.
[34:54.780 --> 34:55.720]  Appreciate those piss rats.
[34:56.020 --> 34:56.880]  Everybody loves a piss rat.
[34:57.720 --> 34:58.460]  Thanks for the piss.
[34:59.480 --> 35:01.100]  Rocking the rat. We appreciate it.
[35:01.500 --> 35:01.680]  Oh!
[35:01.680 --> 35:01.760]  Oh!
[35:04.140 --> 35:04.660]  Oh!
[35:07.120 --> 35:08.580]  You made it change colors.
[35:09.500 --> 35:11.080]  Oh, you changed the color of it.
[35:11.400 --> 35:13.100]  Oh, it's looping around!
[35:13.680 --> 35:13.820]  Oh!
[35:15.220 --> 35:15.740]  No!
[35:16.820 --> 35:18.040]  Geoff, come here. Come here, Geoff.
[35:18.240 --> 35:18.820]  Come here, Geoff.
[35:20.600 --> 35:21.680]  God damn it.
[35:22.520 --> 35:23.920]  God damn it.
[35:25.400 --> 35:26.160]  Go, go now.
[35:27.480 --> 35:29.480]  I presume Twitch chat rules are the same
[35:29.480 --> 35:30.400]  as the RT chat rules.
[35:30.500 --> 35:32.000]  I don't even know what they are.
[35:34.040 --> 35:34.460]  Uh-oh.
[35:35.620 --> 35:36.160]  Uh-oh.
[35:37.640 --> 35:38.120]  Oh!
[35:39.640 --> 35:40.800]  Oh, Geoff's got one too.
[35:41.260 --> 35:41.880]  Oh, shit.
[35:43.360 --> 35:44.820]  Shit, shit, shit.
[35:45.020 --> 35:45.180]  No!
[35:47.260 --> 35:47.740]  Wait.
[35:49.080 --> 35:50.160]  Let me out!
[35:53.520 --> 35:54.860]  I thought I could make it.
[35:55.920 --> 35:56.400]  Core.
[35:56.980 --> 35:58.540]  John Kratos at it again.
[36:01.020 --> 36:03.000]  Did you guys know that Kratos' first name is John?
[36:03.480 --> 36:04.460]  No, I didn't know that.
[36:05.040 --> 36:05.320]  Apparently.
[36:08.620 --> 36:09.980]  According to my streams, apparently.
[36:11.300 --> 36:12.500]  How have your streams been going?
[36:13.200 --> 36:13.640]  Good!
[36:14.020 --> 36:15.560]  I learned all about John Kratos.
[36:20.200 --> 36:21.640]  I'm staying on the outskirts.
[36:21.640 --> 36:22.020]  Oops.
[36:22.720 --> 36:23.700]  Oh, my God.
[36:25.280 --> 36:26.100]  How'd I do that?
[36:27.760 --> 36:29.780]  I hate it when I throw something
[36:29.780 --> 36:30.680]  before I arm it.
[36:31.120 --> 36:32.040]  I do that a lot.
[36:32.340 --> 36:33.520]  I just got the lightsaber gun.
[36:35.060 --> 36:35.960]  I don't like that.
[36:37.320 --> 36:38.300]  That's so cool.
[36:39.480 --> 36:40.380]  It is, well, for you.
[36:40.480 --> 36:42.240]  I don't like the guy in the middle.
[36:49.730 --> 36:51.430]  Oh, that was almost amazing.
[36:56.050 --> 36:57.590]  Alright, we can't have Geoff
[36:57.590 --> 36:58.530]  win this one, too.
[37:00.030 --> 37:01.510]  I'm happy with my two.
[37:04.350 --> 37:05.050]  Oh, fuck.
[37:05.510 --> 37:06.750]  Oh, yeah.
[37:07.730 --> 37:08.270]  That was awesome.
[37:08.330 --> 37:08.730]  God.
[37:11.110 --> 37:11.670]  No!
[37:17.250 --> 37:18.530]  Andrew living dangerous.
[37:21.770 --> 37:22.870]  I'm coming for you.
[37:23.990 --> 37:25.310]  Andrew's a heat-seeking missile.
[37:25.550 --> 37:26.630]  I'm coming for you.
[37:29.090 --> 37:29.490]  No!
[37:32.710 --> 37:34.770]  You're going to get a chance at lava as well.
[37:36.530 --> 37:38.790]  Hey, if you're watching this stream right now,
[37:38.910 --> 37:40.610]  what the fuck, but also,
[37:40.810 --> 37:42.930]  thank you, and don't
[37:42.930 --> 37:44.750]  forget, we're streaming again. We're not done.
[37:44.970 --> 37:46.610]  We're going to be done here in a few minutes,
[37:46.730 --> 37:48.870]  but then we're coming back. We're going to stream
[37:48.870 --> 37:50.990]  tonight at 9pm. We're going to play
[37:50.990 --> 37:52.770]  Sloppy Joe's Bingo, and
[37:52.770 --> 37:54.970]  what's extra special cool
[37:54.970 --> 37:56.870]  about this time is that
[37:56.870 --> 37:59.170]  we are using bingo cards
[37:59.170 --> 38:01.070]  that we drafted for the first
[38:01.070 --> 38:02.290]  time ever. It is.
[38:02.710 --> 38:05.010]  Everybody got to pick their own, well, for the
[38:05.010 --> 38:06.270]  most part, got to pick their own
[38:06.750 --> 38:09.110]  bingo slots. We drafted it in front
[38:09.110 --> 38:10.990]  of the Falcons. Yeah, we did.
[38:11.070 --> 38:12.310]  If you're a Patreon member,
[38:12.890 --> 38:14.830]  we drafted it in front of you. Where were you?
[38:15.710 --> 38:17.170]  If you're not a Patreon member,
[38:17.390 --> 38:18.830]  if you were, you could've been there.
[38:18.830 --> 38:19.610]  Super cool.
[38:20.050 --> 38:22.350]  But if you missed it and you're not one, you can join and
[38:22.350 --> 38:24.410]  there'll be a VOD of it as well.
[38:25.330 --> 38:25.770]  Oh!
[38:27.130 --> 38:28.310]  Hey, that actually worked.
[38:29.150 --> 38:30.330]  Andrew, that was amazing.
[38:30.730 --> 38:32.430]  I was just spinning it.
[38:32.710 --> 38:33.830]  It looked so cool.
[38:34.130 --> 38:36.050]  It looked very cool. There was no skill there.
[38:36.670 --> 38:38.590]  Dog and hog. Peebus Jeebus knows
[38:38.590 --> 38:39.110]  what's up.
[38:42.030 --> 38:42.470]  Oh!
[38:44.130 --> 38:46.310]  Oh God, you both went for... Oh!
[38:46.310 --> 38:47.530]  That was so cool!
[38:47.710 --> 38:49.370]  That was so cool, Gavin!
[38:49.870 --> 38:50.910]  That was awesome!
[38:52.590 --> 38:54.210]  That's my favorite. That was real Jedi
[38:54.210 --> 38:55.430]  shit. Yeah.
[38:56.630 --> 38:58.150]  Oh, what's this one? That was incredible.
[39:06.260 --> 39:06.820]  Oh!
[39:07.540 --> 39:09.140]  Shit! Oh, idiot.
[39:09.320 --> 39:10.400]  Idiot, Jedi stupid.
[39:13.220 --> 39:15.060]  If y'all still don't know Sloppy Joe's bingo set,
[39:15.160 --> 39:17.520]  please call it Sloppy Joe's Bingo
[39:17.520 --> 39:19.500]  Sloppy Seconds. We're definitely not
[39:19.500 --> 39:20.060]  going to do that.
[39:22.780 --> 39:23.520]  But I can tell
[39:23.520 --> 39:24.440]  Gavin wishes we would.
[39:25.980 --> 39:26.780]  Sloppy Seconds?
[39:26.900 --> 39:29.140]  Yeah, I think that's a pretty good name for it.
[39:31.220 --> 39:33.700]  Well, maybe we will if we do it. Unfortunately, the bingo set
[39:33.700 --> 39:34.600]  didn't sell for shit.
[39:35.600 --> 39:35.800]  Oh!
[39:39.160 --> 39:41.500]  It's weird how, like, some of our
[39:41.500 --> 39:43.520]  dumb shit flew off the shelves, and some
[39:43.520 --> 39:45.480]  of our dumb shit made a pretty
[39:45.480 --> 39:46.800]  happy little home on the shelves.
[39:47.520 --> 39:49.440]  Well, I mean, especially if you could just join
[39:49.440 --> 39:51.540]  for random on
[39:51.540 --> 39:53.140]  the internet. Yeah.
[39:54.040 --> 39:55.480]  And also, like, it was bundled
[39:55.480 --> 39:56.180]  with a shirt.
[39:57.280 --> 39:59.480]  So, like, if you wanted the set, like, it's...
[40:00.020 --> 40:01.480]  it wasn't... the shirt wasn't in your
[40:01.480 --> 40:03.560]  size. Like, half the set
[40:04.060 --> 40:04.760]  didn't work.
[40:06.420 --> 40:06.840]  Oh!
[40:11.680 --> 40:13.080]  Oh, did I live, Geoff?
[40:13.080 --> 40:15.060]  Did I live? I wanna live!
[40:15.440 --> 40:16.700]  Geoff! Geoff! Geoff!
[40:16.940 --> 40:17.840]  Geoff! No!
[40:20.340 --> 40:21.220]  That was really
[40:21.220 --> 40:22.880]  good. Thank you.
[40:23.900 --> 40:24.420]  Balance.
[40:25.600 --> 40:26.180]  I think that
[40:26.180 --> 40:28.960]  the, um, clock
[40:28.960 --> 40:30.880]  was so much cooler than I expected.
[40:31.720 --> 40:33.280]  Yeah. I like that clock.
[40:33.660 --> 40:34.900]  I too liked the clock.
[40:37.340 --> 40:38.720]  Andrew, look at my hot stick.
[40:39.760 --> 40:41.040]  Well, you didn't like the clock
[40:41.040 --> 40:43.400]  enough to have a thousand of them.
[40:43.700 --> 40:45.240]  I would've liked the clock. Not on the day
[40:45.240 --> 40:47.000]  my house went for sale and I had an open
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.020]  house. You didn't love the clock.
[40:50.140 --> 40:51.080]  Oh, yours was
[40:51.080 --> 40:52.880]  so much longer. Oh, bah.
[40:53.720 --> 40:54.920]  First time I've heard that.
[40:55.440 --> 40:56.360]  Oh, oh, oh.
[40:56.760 --> 40:58.460]  Love you too, the grumpy monk.
[40:59.940 --> 41:01.400]  Oh, shit, I had a...
[41:01.400 --> 41:02.940]  I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no.
[41:03.060 --> 41:05.040]  Oops! Oh, I almost
[41:05.040 --> 41:06.220]  died. That was so close.
[41:06.800 --> 41:08.940]  Oh, no, don't fire it. No!
[41:08.940 --> 41:11.320]  That just increasingly
[41:11.320 --> 41:12.100]  got worse.
[41:14.140 --> 41:15.400]  Ay, congratulations, Gav.
[41:15.760 --> 41:16.180]  Ay!
[41:16.720 --> 41:17.180]  2-2.
[41:18.660 --> 41:20.560]  So now we need a deciding round.
[41:21.440 --> 41:22.560]  Yeah, this is it.
[41:23.400 --> 41:25.060]  This is the one that
[41:25.060 --> 41:27.180]  will decide the whole game unless Andrew wins.
[41:27.960 --> 41:28.380]  Oh.
[41:29.340 --> 41:30.680]  Oh, we're doing another one then.
[41:31.360 --> 41:32.440]  Cause I got this in the bag!
[41:33.420 --> 41:34.680]  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
[41:34.760 --> 41:36.340]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[41:37.160 --> 41:37.560]  Okay.
[41:38.780 --> 41:40.240]  There was nothing to grab onto.
[41:41.660 --> 41:42.360]  We have a good
[41:42.360 --> 41:44.400]  start so far. I wish the web was faster.
[41:48.700 --> 41:50.440]  I really do hope we, uh, we see
[41:50.440 --> 41:51.880]  all you guys later on for Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[41:52.480 --> 41:54.120]  That's gonna be a fun one tonight.
[41:55.640 --> 41:56.560]  I picked some
[41:57.080 --> 41:58.580]  real winners for my card.
[41:59.680 --> 42:00.360]  Which means
[42:00.360 --> 42:02.440]  Nick also picked some real winners for his card.
[42:03.060 --> 42:03.260]  Fuck!
[42:06.300 --> 42:06.780]  Draw!
[42:07.200 --> 42:09.260]  I'll take that. I'll take that.
[42:12.420 --> 42:13.340]  I love the music.
[42:13.500 --> 42:15.200]  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
[42:15.200 --> 42:16.660]  Oh, no. Oh, my gosh.
[42:23.620 --> 42:25.040]  Oh, I fuckin'
[42:25.280 --> 42:26.560]  knocked my thing in the water.
[42:28.140 --> 42:29.580]  God, what is...
[42:29.580 --> 42:30.520]  What is yours?
[42:30.940 --> 42:32.500]  I think I'm supposed to shoot it.
[42:32.500 --> 42:34.400]  I always think it's a melee, but I think it's a weapon.
[42:35.220 --> 42:36.100]  It's like a launcher.
[42:36.120 --> 42:36.620]  Nice job, Gav.
[42:37.700 --> 42:38.040]  Ooh,
[42:43.020 --> 42:43.360]  Injiz.
[42:45.540 --> 42:45.880]  Injiz.
[42:53.240 --> 42:53.920]  Oh, shit.
[42:55.260 --> 42:56.620]  Oh, my God, I've got the laser one.
[42:58.000 --> 42:58.680]  Come here, bitch.
[42:58.820 --> 42:59.680]  Come here, you bitch.
[43:01.980 --> 43:03.480]  Oh, we got...
[43:03.480 --> 43:04.680]  Touch tips. Touch tips.
[43:04.680 --> 43:05.980]  Touch the tips.
[43:06.740 --> 43:07.300]  Swing!
[43:17.540 --> 43:18.640]  It's a draw.
[43:19.040 --> 43:21.260]  I hate myself. I suck.
[43:21.820 --> 43:23.320]  That was so much fun.
[43:24.120 --> 43:25.400]  No, you're not catching up on
[43:25.400 --> 43:27.040]  wrestling tonight, freelancers.
[43:27.040 --> 43:29.180]  Whatever. You're hanging out with us.
[43:29.200 --> 43:30.140]  God damn it.
[43:31.900 --> 43:32.940]  We're all watching
[43:32.940 --> 43:34.600]  people get drunk on the street.
[43:34.800 --> 43:36.140]  Oh, I'm getting smashed around.
[43:36.260 --> 43:38.040]  Oh, the stuff fell on my head.
[43:41.300 --> 43:42.260]  Somebody draws.
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.160]  God damn it.
[43:44.540 --> 43:47.140]  Well, now we're all at the same level, right?
[43:49.760 --> 43:50.240]  So...
[43:50.240 --> 43:51.200]  I got a little stick.
[43:51.360 --> 43:51.680]  What is this?
[43:53.760 --> 43:54.520]  Oh, tennis.
[43:54.520 --> 43:55.040]  Tennis.
[43:56.520 --> 43:57.980]  Get that blue shit away from me.
[43:58.080 --> 44:00.520]  God damn it. I sure did.
[44:05.800 --> 44:06.640]  Damn it.
[44:07.120 --> 44:07.800]  I needed that.
[44:14.960 --> 44:17.420]  I thought you were maybe going to break some chains with that one.
[44:20.080 --> 44:21.360]  Oh, the saw blade.
[44:23.980 --> 44:25.800]  Fuck him too. I couldn't pull back up
[44:25.800 --> 44:26.920]  in time. Damn.
[44:27.320 --> 44:28.180]  That was a great shot, Gavin.
[44:28.740 --> 44:29.420]  Thank you.
[44:30.800 --> 44:32.740]  Yeah, Sloppy Joe's, 9pm tonight.
[44:33.580 --> 44:34.140]  This spot.
[44:34.440 --> 44:36.820]  If you're here right now, you know where to go.
[44:37.680 --> 44:39.720]  Don't dummy. Stop sucking.
[44:41.200 --> 44:41.700]  Lob.
[44:44.720 --> 44:45.900]  On the head, son.
[44:56.180 --> 44:57.540]  He's hanging out watched.
[45:04.810 --> 45:05.650]  Long shot.
[45:11.350 --> 45:12.590]  Get over here.
[45:13.070 --> 45:14.490]  Get away from that.
[45:14.670 --> 45:16.150]  That was awesome.
[45:16.590 --> 45:19.590]  You swatted the weapon away from me and then killed me
[45:19.590 --> 45:20.410]  with the next swat.
[45:21.010 --> 45:22.850]  That was like some Three Musketeers shit right there.
[45:29.010 --> 45:30.430]  Oh, nice, Gavin.
[45:30.690 --> 45:32.190]  This might be Gavin's day right here.
[45:33.810 --> 45:34.570]  Two more.
[45:34.910 --> 45:35.570]  Wait, three more?
[45:35.890 --> 45:36.290]  Three more.
[45:38.850 --> 45:39.330]  No.
[45:41.270 --> 45:41.750]  Tennis.
[45:42.150 --> 45:43.550]  Oh, you hit the tennis back.
[45:43.650 --> 45:45.870]  Oh, I was alive.
[45:45.950 --> 45:46.970]  That's why I survived that.
[45:47.230 --> 45:47.850]  What a fool.
[45:49.750 --> 45:51.530]  Oh, Andrew's scraping his niblets.
[45:52.870 --> 45:53.830]  Oh, shit.
[45:54.590 --> 45:55.550]  See that cool flip I did?
[45:55.550 --> 45:56.650]  That was really cool.
[45:57.390 --> 45:58.270]  Yeah, that was pretty awesome.
[45:59.930 --> 46:01.750]  Is that a really long roll?
[46:05.670 --> 46:06.510]  Oops, I forgot to pause it.
[46:06.510 --> 46:07.650]  That is massive.
[46:11.110 --> 46:11.750]  Oh, no.
[46:13.770 --> 46:14.850]  We're in each other's shit.
[46:15.310 --> 46:16.890]  Oh, you blew up my left.
[46:17.070 --> 46:18.950]  Oh, no, don't hit the lift.
[46:21.890 --> 46:22.330]  Gunfight.
[46:22.330 --> 46:22.370]  Gunfight.
[46:26.380 --> 46:27.780]  Come on up here.
[46:28.200 --> 46:28.820]  Oh.
[46:30.160 --> 46:31.960]  Oh, it blasted away.
[46:32.280 --> 46:32.980]  Another weapon.
[46:33.800 --> 46:35.200]  The weapons are getting lower.
[46:35.540 --> 46:38.120]  Oh, nice grab.
[46:39.900 --> 46:41.880]  Gavin should have the ammo advantage.
[46:42.220 --> 46:43.240]  You shot out of my hands.
[46:43.860 --> 46:44.400]  Give me a stick.
[46:44.720 --> 46:46.020]  Oh, I'll take this.
[46:46.440 --> 46:48.040]  That was amazing.
[46:49.200 --> 46:50.940]  That was so cool.
[46:52.200 --> 46:52.760]  Fuck.
[46:53.140 --> 46:54.340]  I still got him.
[46:55.060 --> 46:56.840]  I thought I could knock it back at you.
[46:56.960 --> 46:57.760]  You almost did.
[47:01.860 --> 47:03.560]  This game's fucking great.
[47:03.720 --> 47:04.200]  I love it.
[47:04.480 --> 47:06.940]  Oh, I suck. I hate it.
[47:20.670 --> 47:21.690]  Geoff, stop.
[47:25.640 --> 47:29.080]  Oh, god damn son of a...
[47:29.080 --> 47:29.540]  I know.
[47:32.640 --> 47:33.660]  You bitch.
[47:33.900 --> 47:36.860]  Oh, Andrew with the lightning fast attacks from above.
[47:37.860 --> 47:39.180]  Disarmed each other.
[47:39.760 --> 47:40.340]  Give me this.
[47:45.360 --> 47:46.160]  Disarmed again.
[47:47.160 --> 47:47.740]  You got me.
[47:49.720 --> 47:51.420]  Andrew is picking it up.
[47:51.460 --> 47:53.060]  Once in every eight rounds.
[47:53.760 --> 47:55.360]  So intense. This is great.
[47:55.620 --> 47:56.180]  I'll grab this.
[47:58.700 --> 47:59.440]  Stop it.
[47:59.560 --> 47:59.800]  Stop it.
[47:59.800 --> 48:00.500]  Stop it.
[48:03.660 --> 48:04.140]  Fuck.
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.800]  That was terrifying, Gavin.
[48:10.040 --> 48:12.020]  They were just bouncing back at me.
[48:13.860 --> 48:18.160]  Fuck, I keep forgetting to arm it.
[48:18.280 --> 48:18.980]  I just throw it.
[48:20.120 --> 48:20.360]  No.
[48:22.400 --> 48:23.400]  How did I die?
[48:23.560 --> 48:25.440]  I shot a grenade at you.
[48:26.120 --> 48:26.600]  Nice.
[48:26.600 --> 48:28.900]  God damn, you're about to win now.
[48:33.950 --> 48:34.550]  Andrew.
[48:37.830 --> 48:39.470]  That was so bad.
[48:39.550 --> 48:40.290]  I threw it.
[48:40.470 --> 48:42.410]  The stick fight.
[48:49.570 --> 48:51.130]  Bring it on.
[48:53.870 --> 49:04.220]  What a move, Geoff.
[49:04.360 --> 49:05.340]  No, Geoff.
[49:06.080 --> 49:06.580]  Why?
[49:07.340 --> 49:09.400]  I thought it was going to tie.
[49:09.860 --> 49:11.220]  I was worried you were going to tie it.
[49:11.440 --> 49:12.620]  It was really close.
[49:15.660 --> 49:16.520]  Oh, shit.
[49:16.980 --> 49:17.200]  No.
[49:18.200 --> 49:18.700]  Damn.
[49:20.640 --> 49:21.520]  The beam.
[49:22.800 --> 49:24.180]  Just stay alive, Geoff.
[49:24.460 --> 49:25.900]  Hold on to those testes.
[49:26.240 --> 49:26.980]  Those balls.
[49:27.420 --> 49:29.360]  Just grab on to them.
[49:30.120 --> 49:31.160]  Give me this, whatever this is.
[49:31.160 --> 49:31.760]  What is this?
[49:32.480 --> 49:34.440]  One nut free.
[49:36.800 --> 49:37.180]  No.
[49:39.200 --> 49:40.780]  Cut the chain.
[49:41.440 --> 49:42.400]  Cut the chain.
[49:43.580 --> 49:45.020]  I'm so scared.
[49:45.960 --> 49:47.260]  I need a weapon.
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.420]  There's nothing sporting around me.
[49:53.560 --> 49:54.120]  Above yours.
[49:54.280 --> 49:54.560]  Give me this.
[49:54.560 --> 49:55.260]  Give me this.
[49:59.940 --> 50:00.820]  Oh, no.
[50:02.360 --> 50:03.920]  Gavin has the bomb.
[50:05.140 --> 50:06.560]  Okay, well, that really didn't...
[50:07.960 --> 50:10.100]  Oh, no. Geoff has his.
[50:10.360 --> 50:11.400]  Geoff, shoot the chain.
[50:11.840 --> 50:12.860]  Aim up for the chain.
[50:13.700 --> 50:14.860]  Get the chain shot.
[50:17.960 --> 50:18.400]  Yeah!
[50:24.560 --> 50:26.460]  Get it while swinging on my balls.
[50:28.320 --> 50:29.520]  It's dead even.
[50:31.500 --> 50:32.280]  Oops.
[50:34.220 --> 50:37.360]  After all that.
[50:38.180 --> 50:39.640]  After fucking all that.
[50:40.260 --> 50:41.020]  Congratulations.
[50:42.080 --> 50:42.480]  It's a drop.
[50:43.200 --> 50:44.740]  I held it down too long.
[50:51.640 --> 50:53.200]  Oh, no.
[50:53.200 --> 50:55.000]  No, no, no.
[50:55.000 --> 50:55.080]  No.
[50:58.810 --> 50:59.530]  No!
[51:03.430 --> 51:04.150]  Oh!
[51:05.650 --> 51:07.010]  It's another drop!
[51:08.110 --> 51:08.330]  Yes!
[51:11.590 --> 51:14.950]  I just need to stay alive after I murder everyone.
[51:15.130 --> 51:15.950]  Just need to live.
[51:16.870 --> 51:19.570]  Oh, no!
[51:20.430 --> 51:20.790]  Hold!
[51:22.650 --> 51:24.630]  Okay, I'm on the board again.
[51:24.630 --> 51:26.530]  As I said, one in every eight.
[51:27.630 --> 51:28.670]  Oh, not at all, but...
[51:30.110 --> 51:30.910]  Okay, that one.
[51:33.310 --> 51:34.170]  Oh, Andrew.
[51:35.730 --> 51:36.690]  Oh, Andrew.
[51:38.630 --> 51:40.430]  Oh, Gavin! Oh, it's a streak!
[51:40.630 --> 51:41.330]  It's a streak!
[51:43.130 --> 51:44.190]  It's the climb!
[51:46.670 --> 51:49.070]  I don't think I understood the gravity of that one.
[51:53.860 --> 51:54.500]  Oh!
[51:54.840 --> 51:55.240]  Geoff sucks.
[51:55.800 --> 51:59.100]  God, I am just fucking dog shit under pressure, man.
[51:59.420 --> 52:00.740]  Just like the old days.
[52:01.400 --> 52:02.040]  Andrew.
[52:04.920 --> 52:07.140]  No! God damn it!
[52:07.160 --> 52:08.140]  Good job, Gav.
[52:08.240 --> 52:09.780]  Good job, Gav.
[52:10.720 --> 52:11.040]  Congratulations.
[52:11.520 --> 52:13.020]  Three to two to nothing.
[52:13.460 --> 52:16.220]  Well, thank you so much for joining in.
[52:16.640 --> 52:18.140]  Closer. Oh, wow.
[52:18.140 --> 52:19.280]  Intense.
[52:20.220 --> 52:22.660]  This monstrosity of a stream.
[52:22.860 --> 52:23.320]  Thanks to everyone who stuck with us.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  We will be back at what time?
[52:26.100 --> 52:28.400]  9pm Central? 7pm Pacific?
[52:29.160 --> 52:29.820]  10pm Eastern?
[52:29.820 --> 52:31.000]  Four hours from now.
[52:31.460 --> 52:33.260]  Four hours from now.
[52:33.480 --> 52:35.120]  Set time up for four hours.
[52:35.300 --> 52:36.180]  Four hours.
[52:37.200 --> 52:38.480]  Let's wrap this up.
[52:39.160 --> 52:39.880]  Hey, it's 5.01.
[52:40.740 --> 52:42.360]  Hey! 5.01.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.420]  You know, it's best time of the week.
[52:44.420 --> 52:45.860]  5.02 now. We missed it.
[52:46.120 --> 52:46.740]  We missed it.
[52:47.480 --> 52:50.620]  We will miss you later on Sloppy Joe's.
[52:50.860 --> 52:52.240]  Talk to y'all soon.
[52:53.000 --> 52:53.300]  Bye!
[52:54.440 --> 52:54.780]  Bye!
