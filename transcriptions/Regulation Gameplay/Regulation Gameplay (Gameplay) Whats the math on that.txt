[00:00.000 --> 00:03.160]  Just to be clear, I salvaged all three of those guys.
[00:03.240 --> 00:05.020]  No, I salvaged the second one. What are you talking about?
[00:05.340 --> 00:06.720]  Do you think he did one, but you didn't?
[00:06.800 --> 00:07.080]  Didn't.
[00:07.300 --> 00:08.200]  I did one.
[00:08.460 --> 00:09.200]  He didn't.
[00:09.200 --> 00:09.900]  I did.
[00:10.040 --> 00:13.800]  I pressed right on the D-pad to salvage, and Nick did that.
[00:13.940 --> 00:14.460]  I love that.
[00:14.720 --> 00:16.780]  50% eat sounds like 100% disagree.
[00:17.560 --> 00:18.600]  And 50% disagree.
[00:18.940 --> 00:21.800]  Yeah, 50% right, 50% wrong, and I'm right.
[00:23.200 --> 00:25.840]  Just trying to imagine this written out as an equation.
[00:26.200 --> 00:29.680]  50% eat, 50% wrong, and 100% wrong,
[00:29.680 --> 00:32.520]  If you agree to disagree, that's a 50% agree, right?
[00:33.140 --> 00:34.040]  There it is.
[00:36.560 --> 00:37.440]  No, yeah.
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.140]  I'm just gonna walk away, Regis. I'm just gonna take the money.
[00:43.500 --> 00:44.740]  I need to open my window.
[00:45.420 --> 00:48.860]  The most Nick thing. Disagreeing, agreeing, disagreeing.
[00:49.120 --> 00:49.840]  What do you mean?
[00:50.660 --> 00:51.100]  No.
[00:51.800 --> 00:52.260]  Well, maybe.
[00:53.240 --> 00:54.400]  There you have it.
[00:55.580 --> 00:57.220]  Is this what it's like to talk to me?
