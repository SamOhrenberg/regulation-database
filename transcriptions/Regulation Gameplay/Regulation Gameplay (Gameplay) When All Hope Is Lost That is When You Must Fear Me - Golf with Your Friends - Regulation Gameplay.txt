[00:00.000 --> 00:01.540]  Hit the start button, Nick!
[00:01.840 --> 00:03.360]  You're the one who invited all of us.
[00:04.620 --> 00:05.900]  He was just making sure everybody was ready.
[00:06.020 --> 00:07.060]  After everybody said they were ready.
[00:07.300 --> 00:09.200]  I thought ready meant for the video.
[00:09.860 --> 00:10.700]  Twilight, like the...
[00:10.700 --> 00:11.720]  Are this a vampire one?
[00:11.980 --> 00:12.220]  Yeah.
[00:12.480 --> 00:12.620]  No.
[00:12.760 --> 00:13.640]  With the CG baby?
[00:14.280 --> 00:14.500]  Yeah.
[00:14.800 --> 00:15.020]  Oh.
[00:15.960 --> 00:17.520]  Oh, the hole is quite close.
[00:17.860 --> 00:18.240]  Is it?
[00:18.380 --> 00:18.740]  Nessie?
[00:20.280 --> 00:20.660]  Uh-oh.
[00:21.120 --> 00:22.320]  The hole is very close.
[00:22.460 --> 00:23.420]  Slow, slow, slow!
[00:23.720 --> 00:23.980]  No!
[00:24.720 --> 00:25.320]  Uh-oh.
[00:25.580 --> 00:26.120]  Reindeer boy.
[00:26.960 --> 00:28.000]  I'm trying to win here.
[00:28.060 --> 00:28.560]  Oh no!
[00:28.700 --> 00:29.440]  I'm trying to win.
[00:29.940 --> 00:30.340]  No!
[00:30.980 --> 00:33.440]  When all hope is lost, that's when you must fear me.
[00:34.200 --> 00:34.920]  Yeah, I know.
[00:35.020 --> 00:35.420]  There we go.
[00:35.500 --> 00:36.520]  Oh, come on!
[00:37.640 --> 00:38.060]  Oh, Geoff.
[00:38.280 --> 00:38.360]  Bogey!
[00:38.860 --> 00:39.700]  Hello, I'm Geoff.
[00:40.800 --> 00:41.560]  Hi, Geoff.
[00:43.920 --> 00:44.480]  Oh no.
[00:44.880 --> 00:45.800]  Double bogey.
[00:45.800 --> 00:46.340]  Oh, damn.
[00:46.380 --> 00:46.560]  Yeah.
[00:47.040 --> 00:47.640]  Not a good start.
[00:47.640 --> 00:49.340]  I need to investigate this hole.
[00:49.460 --> 00:50.080]  It's a rough start.
[00:50.260 --> 00:51.740]  Oh, Geoff, it's Geoff.
[00:51.880 --> 00:52.740]  Sherlock Geoff.
[00:54.060 --> 00:54.720]  Oh, Geoff.
[00:54.920 --> 00:54.940]  No.
[00:55.060 --> 00:55.580]  Oh, Geoff.
[00:55.900 --> 00:58.100]  Dude, it's all elementary from here.
[00:58.660 --> 00:59.240]  Geoff, where?
[01:00.020 --> 01:01.360]  Eric with his...
[01:01.360 --> 01:03.140]  No, I'm already in.
[01:03.360 --> 01:04.920]  Look, you can see I'm already in the hole.
[01:05.040 --> 01:06.020]  It was Gavin all the way.
[01:06.400 --> 01:08.100]  No, you just went in the right after you did that.
[01:08.500 --> 01:09.380]  I'm trying to...
[01:09.380 --> 01:11.040]  I'm trying to win right now, Geoff.
[01:11.400 --> 01:12.900]  It's somebody else's double bogey.
[01:13.060 --> 01:13.240]  Yeah.
[01:13.320 --> 01:14.040]  I'm not claiming it.
[01:14.340 --> 01:16.680]  Wow, Andrew's in the lead with a bogey.
[01:18.520 --> 01:19.560]  This bogey's well...
[01:20.960 --> 01:21.380]  Shit!
[01:21.880 --> 01:22.660]  Yeah, pretty easy.
[01:22.760 --> 01:23.940]  Oh God, way too hard.
[01:24.100 --> 01:24.200]  Wow.
[01:25.020 --> 01:25.900]  I'm overbeating.
[01:27.020 --> 01:27.460]  No!
[01:30.120 --> 01:30.980]  No, no!
[01:31.020 --> 01:31.980]  That looked really cool, Gavin.
[01:32.680 --> 01:34.100]  That looked really cool, Geoff.
[01:34.520 --> 01:35.320]  Tony Hawk.
[01:36.800 --> 01:37.620]  Come on!
[01:38.440 --> 01:42.340]  Okay, Gavin, you found the way around it.
[01:43.380 --> 01:44.380]  Gross, Gavin.
[01:45.080 --> 01:46.760]  Oh, is there a fucking...
[01:46.760 --> 01:47.820]  You just go to the side?
[01:48.340 --> 01:48.660]  No.
[01:50.160 --> 01:50.680]  No!
[01:51.300 --> 01:51.900]  Nice job!
[01:53.580 --> 01:54.680]  Geoff, that looked great.
[01:55.860 --> 01:56.500]  Well, now I just...
[01:56.500 --> 01:56.560]  Too far.
[01:56.800 --> 01:57.000]  No!
[01:57.500 --> 01:58.100]  Too far.
[01:59.540 --> 02:01.040]  Okay, this is my shot right here.
[02:01.500 --> 02:02.340]  Bingo, bango.
[02:02.640 --> 02:02.700]  No!
[02:03.240 --> 02:03.900]  What the hell?
[02:05.560 --> 02:07.280]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[02:07.460 --> 02:09.200]  Wow, Geoff, that was nuts.
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.080]  Hey, shut up.
[02:10.080 --> 02:10.120]  No!
[02:10.780 --> 02:12.480]  Wow, that was too hard.
[02:13.140 --> 02:13.160]  Jeez.
[02:13.720 --> 02:15.900]  Dude, it's been a while since we played this game, I guess.
[02:16.360 --> 02:16.880]  Jesus Christ.
[02:16.880 --> 02:17.780]  Seven strokes.
[02:17.980 --> 02:19.660]  That's what I'm going to have in real life today.
[02:19.720 --> 02:20.520]  That was eight on me.
[02:20.580 --> 02:21.060]  That was brutal.
[02:21.820 --> 02:22.220]  Wow.
[02:22.980 --> 02:23.380]  Woof.
[02:24.520 --> 02:25.840]  Fuck you, Nick, too.
[02:25.880 --> 02:26.340]  Great job, Nick.
[02:26.340 --> 02:26.980]  Get out of here.
[02:27.100 --> 02:28.460]  I found the side pretty quick.
[02:29.120 --> 02:29.940]  Zip, zip, zap.
[02:31.220 --> 02:32.060]  We zipping?
[02:32.700 --> 02:33.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:33.180 --> 02:33.320]  Get me down there.
[02:33.540 --> 02:34.280]  Get me down there.
[02:34.600 --> 02:35.080]  Me and Gavin.
[02:35.660 --> 02:36.020]  Oh!
[02:37.540 --> 02:38.720]  Like Plinko style.
[02:39.380 --> 02:40.060]  Oh, thank you.
[02:40.640 --> 02:40.860]  Yeah.
[02:41.020 --> 02:44.200]  Oh, Gavin, you've activated my kill instinct.
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.780]  That wasn't me, that was Geoff.
[02:46.120 --> 02:46.720]  That was...
[02:46.720 --> 02:46.880]  What?
[02:47.160 --> 02:50.380]  Gavin has activated my kill instinct.
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.400]  Nice, a nice bogey.
[02:55.400 --> 02:58.880]  Everyone immediately dove into the hole as soon as you said kill instinct.
[02:59.120 --> 02:59.500]  Yeah.
[03:00.860 --> 03:04.020]  Gavin has activated a primal urge.
[03:04.240 --> 03:05.360]  Gavin, why would you do it?
[03:05.600 --> 03:05.920]  Gavin!
[03:06.580 --> 03:06.740]  The kill instinct.
[03:06.740 --> 03:08.360]  Why would you be activated towards Nick and Andrew?
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.940]  The kill instinct rises.
[03:09.940 --> 03:11.220]  You're riving with me!
[03:12.120 --> 03:14.060]  The kill instinct rises.
[03:14.440 --> 03:15.480]  Yeah, but I wasn't though.
[03:15.800 --> 03:16.760]  Oh, no!
[03:18.500 --> 03:18.820]  Yeah!
[03:19.740 --> 03:20.220]  Oh.
[03:21.240 --> 03:21.900]  Oh.
[03:22.240 --> 03:23.380]  Oh, I needed that.
[03:39.740 --> 03:42.220]  No! Oh, this is going to be a problem.
[03:42.720 --> 03:43.820]  Why do we do this?
[03:47.500 --> 03:47.960]  Please!
[03:48.940 --> 03:51.800]  Oh no! They crossed the balls!
[03:52.860 --> 03:54.220]  I get it!
[03:54.220 --> 03:56.440]  Oh, Geoff was just a little short.
[03:57.520 --> 03:58.160]  No!
[03:58.900 --> 04:00.100]  Geoff was a little short.
[04:02.380 --> 04:03.920]  That was weird.
[04:04.120 --> 04:04.420]  Eric!
[04:07.380 --> 04:09.820]  My kill instinct rises.
[04:10.940 --> 04:12.960]  Oh no, come on!
[04:13.100 --> 04:13.920]  Come on, go the other way.
[04:14.440 --> 04:16.400]  Come on! Stupid fucking deer.
[04:16.760 --> 04:17.680]  This sucks!
[04:20.240 --> 04:21.480]  There it is!
[04:21.480 --> 04:22.060]  Yes!
[04:22.380 --> 04:25.640]  Clip that! I ollied off of Gavin.
[04:25.780 --> 04:27.300]  Made it in the hole. That was so sick.
[04:27.580 --> 04:28.600]  You made it in from that?
[04:28.860 --> 04:29.220]  Yes.
[04:31.060 --> 04:33.660]  I used my kill instinct.
[04:34.600 --> 04:35.200]  Oh, Geoff.
[04:35.980 --> 04:37.680]  I think we all know what we have to do now.
[04:39.440 --> 04:40.220]  Let's kill Andrew.
[04:40.560 --> 04:41.800]  We must destroy Gavin.
[04:42.620 --> 04:44.500]  I'm already losing.
[04:44.960 --> 04:46.240]  Yeah, Geoff.
[04:46.940 --> 04:48.600]  There we go, 11 strokes. Easy peasy.
[04:51.640 --> 04:52.660]  20 seconds left.
[04:53.000 --> 04:53.880]  You can do it, Gavin.
[04:54.680 --> 04:57.120]  No, you can't.
[04:58.820 --> 04:59.800]  Oh, he got it!
[05:01.960 --> 05:02.600]  10 seconds.
[05:04.100 --> 05:05.340]  Gavin is all the way at the top.
[05:05.420 --> 05:06.160]  We have to knock him down.
[05:06.300 --> 05:07.860]  Geoff did twice as good as me on that one.
[05:08.860 --> 05:09.860]  Oh, what is this?
[05:17.250 --> 05:17.570]  No!
[05:20.010 --> 05:20.810]  Oh, too far.
[05:20.810 --> 05:21.990]  Too far.
[05:24.990 --> 05:26.110]  Shit, cock.
[05:28.910 --> 05:30.150]  Not in the hole!
[05:31.570 --> 05:32.050]  Uh-oh.
[05:33.870 --> 05:34.630]  There it is.
[05:34.850 --> 05:36.830]  Oh, there we go. We're easy.
[05:36.910 --> 05:37.190]  We're good.
[05:37.590 --> 05:40.270]  Nope, that's no good.
[05:44.210 --> 05:46.070]  Gotta get out of here. Oh, no!
[05:46.710 --> 05:47.090]  No!
[05:47.090 --> 05:47.510]  No!
[05:47.510 --> 05:48.710]  Did you miss, Nick?
[05:49.690 --> 05:50.410]  No.
[05:51.830 --> 05:53.910]  Oh, my God.
[05:57.490 --> 05:58.890]  How did I miss that?
[06:00.910 --> 06:01.510]  Too soft.
[06:02.750 --> 06:03.650]  Way too hard.
[06:03.970 --> 06:04.590]  Fuck me.
[06:05.950 --> 06:07.250]  Hello, Geoff.
[06:07.870 --> 06:08.070]  Hello.
[06:08.930 --> 06:10.990]  Oh, no.
[06:12.270 --> 06:14.030]  A little puddle of golf balls here.
[06:15.210 --> 06:16.690]  This is not good for me.
[06:16.750 --> 06:17.530]  Where did Eric go?
[06:19.650 --> 06:22.030]  I set myself up for success, you know.
[06:26.330 --> 06:27.210]  Oh, Geoff.
[06:28.130 --> 06:29.770]  I'm bouncing over it.
[06:29.990 --> 06:31.570]  How am I not getting in there?
[06:32.750 --> 06:33.590]  That's crazy.
[06:34.090 --> 06:36.430]  I hate myself. I do.
[06:36.710 --> 06:38.910]  I don't... What am I doing wrong here?
[06:39.350 --> 06:40.270]  30 seconds left.
[06:40.510 --> 06:40.830]  Fuck!
[06:42.170 --> 06:44.790]  Andrew, you're still at the beginning a little bit.
[06:45.630 --> 06:46.330]  No!
[06:46.650 --> 06:47.810]  I caught the lip!
[06:48.890 --> 06:50.630]  Out of shots.
[06:50.890 --> 06:51.910]  I'm out of shots.
[06:54.520 --> 06:56.030]  I'm gonna watch Andrew for a little bit.
[06:56.110 --> 06:56.770]  No, please.
[06:57.390 --> 07:00.010]  Come on!
[07:00.690 --> 07:01.390]  No!
[07:02.530 --> 07:04.090]  Now we must kill Gavin.
[07:05.030 --> 07:06.230]  Three seconds.
[07:07.010 --> 07:08.290]  Come on!
[07:08.610 --> 07:09.630]  Kill instinct rises.
[07:12.510 --> 07:14.630]  Oh, that's lovely.
[07:14.830 --> 07:15.290]  Wow!
[07:16.230 --> 07:17.990]  Alright, I think we all know what we have to do.
[07:18.130 --> 07:20.210]  We must destroy Gavin.
[07:21.070 --> 07:23.390]  No longer a fan of Gavin.
[07:24.130 --> 07:25.410]  Andrew, was that good or bad?
[07:25.830 --> 07:26.170]  Good.
[07:28.610 --> 07:29.310]  Where did I go?
[07:31.550 --> 07:34.130]  Is it under or around?
[07:40.560 --> 07:41.520]  Go, Andrew!
[07:41.520 --> 07:41.900]  Yeah!
[07:43.560 --> 07:46.340]  Guys, I think we have to hate Nick again.
[07:46.620 --> 07:47.180]  No, no, no.
[07:47.240 --> 07:48.200]  Not yet.
[07:50.020 --> 07:51.700]  Eric missed. Now's the chance.
[07:53.740 --> 07:54.660]  Hit Gavin!
[07:54.940 --> 07:56.260]  With everything you got!
[07:56.300 --> 07:56.960]  I'm trying!
[07:59.300 --> 08:02.900]  Kill instinct raging out of control.
[08:03.160 --> 08:04.580]  I'm seeing red.
[08:05.480 --> 08:06.960]  I'm not in last.
[08:07.280 --> 08:08.620]  I'm not in last.
[08:08.620 --> 08:11.280]  Can we have your screen slowly get redder as the game goes on?
[08:15.260 --> 08:15.660]  Holy...
[08:15.660 --> 08:16.480]  What the fuck?
[08:17.260 --> 08:19.260]  Where is it?
[08:19.620 --> 08:20.580]  Oh, I guess that way.
[08:22.460 --> 08:23.340]  Oh, Gavin!
[08:23.560 --> 08:25.120]  That was me. I hit you.
[08:25.460 --> 08:26.600]  You did and you saved me.
[08:26.700 --> 08:28.000]  You got me a hole in one!
[08:28.100 --> 08:30.720]  And you were mad about it. You were yelling and stuff.
[08:30.820 --> 08:32.520]  No, I was mad at Gavin for getting two.
[08:32.720 --> 08:34.380]  You were mad at me, but you got one.
[08:35.540 --> 08:36.340]  Yeah, but...
[08:36.340 --> 08:37.060]  Yeah.
[08:38.340 --> 08:39.600]  That was before I got one.
[08:39.720 --> 08:40.620]  Yeah, but he didn't know yet.
[08:41.040 --> 08:42.640]  Right! I was still rolling.
[08:47.930 --> 08:50.050]  Eric, there's no one to hunt. It's just you and Geoff.
[08:50.410 --> 08:52.870]  Kill instinct out of control.
[08:52.870 --> 08:54.010]  You're killing the wrong guy.
[08:54.230 --> 08:55.370]  Let Geoff live, man.
[08:55.910 --> 08:56.690]  Geoff's already through.
[08:56.910 --> 08:57.650]  Oh, he is?
[09:01.430 --> 09:03.090]  Just looking ominous in the bushes?
[09:06.150 --> 09:06.950]  Oh, no.
[09:07.530 --> 09:08.030]  Yeah!
[09:09.350 --> 09:10.250]  Oh, wow.
[09:11.990 --> 09:13.630]  Hey, guys. It's another fun one.
[09:17.610 --> 09:18.310]  Pardon me.
[09:19.410 --> 09:20.430]  Oh, yeah. No worries.
[09:21.270 --> 09:21.730]  Oh!
[09:23.230 --> 09:23.790]  Yeah!
[09:24.630 --> 09:26.370]  Wow, Nick. Did you get it in one?
[09:26.830 --> 09:27.210]  No.
[09:28.310 --> 09:28.630]  Yeah.
[09:31.150 --> 09:32.170]  Coming for you, Gavin.
[09:34.130 --> 09:34.690]  Uh-oh.
[09:35.610 --> 09:36.070]  Uh-oh.
[09:36.330 --> 09:37.670]  Is there a secret down there, Geoff?
[09:42.530 --> 09:44.070]  Geoff just full balls it.
[09:44.410 --> 09:45.010]  Right up the gut.
[09:46.450 --> 09:47.010]  Come here!
[09:47.150 --> 09:47.870]  That's how I did it.
[09:51.890 --> 09:52.290]  Geoff?
[09:53.950 --> 09:55.430]  Full balls it right up the gut.
[09:55.830 --> 09:57.710]  I already did that a hundred times. It doesn't do anything.
[09:58.190 --> 09:58.710]  I made it.
[10:00.610 --> 10:01.630]  Yeah, he did it in one.
[10:01.690 --> 10:02.790]  How come you didn't do it in one?
[10:03.450 --> 10:04.610]  Full balls it right up the gut.
[10:04.670 --> 10:05.510]  Look what happened. Cool.
[10:05.850 --> 10:06.290]  I'm dead.
[10:07.750 --> 10:08.890]  Should I try it again?
[10:09.810 --> 10:10.810]  Should I try that again?
[10:12.090 --> 10:13.230]  Oh, you didn't listen.
[10:13.330 --> 10:15.110]  Oh, I think you didn't hear what Nick said.
[10:15.790 --> 10:17.030]  Oh, what did Nick say?
[10:17.150 --> 10:18.550]  Oh, look. You aimed a little too far to the right.
[10:18.690 --> 10:20.890]  I tried doing anything different.
[10:25.690 --> 10:26.790]  Oh, someone's lying again.
[10:26.950 --> 10:27.450]  Oh, nope.
[10:27.990 --> 10:30.070]  I went full balls right up the gut and it didn't work.
[10:31.890 --> 10:34.010]  I'm going to try full balls right up the gut.
[10:34.190 --> 10:34.950]  Let's see if that works.
[10:37.610 --> 10:38.950]  I'm sorry, it didn't work.
[10:39.050 --> 10:39.950]  Okay, I'm sorry. I'm wrong.
[10:40.070 --> 10:40.390]  I'm wrong.
[10:41.930 --> 10:42.190]  Okay.
[10:42.690 --> 10:45.510]  What if I do it again?
[10:45.750 --> 10:46.110]  Okay, here we go.
[10:46.110 --> 10:47.910]  I was actually trying to help you, Geoff.
[10:48.030 --> 10:48.350]  Damn it.
[10:48.990 --> 10:50.590]  It's not jumping like mine did.
[10:53.680 --> 10:54.120]  Hmm.
[10:54.620 --> 10:56.220]  Nick, were you using advanced tactics?
[10:57.400 --> 10:58.360]  No, I just got lucky.
[10:59.200 --> 10:59.800]  Full balls.
[11:00.640 --> 11:02.620]  You're a little too left. You need to go righter.
[11:03.980 --> 11:04.460]  Right up the gut.
[11:04.460 --> 11:04.820]  Go!
[11:05.560 --> 11:06.540]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[11:10.320 --> 11:12.520]  Oh, Nick caught up so good.
[11:12.640 --> 11:13.480]  He's one behind.
[11:15.040 --> 11:17.000]  I've got half. I've got twice Gavin's score.
[11:17.520 --> 11:17.980]  I want this.
[11:18.220 --> 11:18.800]  Where do we go?
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.520]  Oh, wow. Oh, no!
[11:22.620 --> 11:23.740]  Don't do full balls.
[11:23.880 --> 11:25.080]  Do, uh,
[11:25.780 --> 11:26.660]  slightly less.
[11:28.020 --> 11:29.860]  I'm going to try three-quarter balls.
[11:30.460 --> 11:31.420]  Not enough balls.
[11:31.680 --> 11:32.240]  Not enough balls.
[11:32.540 --> 11:33.580]  Nope, you need more balls than that.
[11:35.940 --> 11:36.620]  There it is.
[11:37.180 --> 11:37.960]  God damn it.
[11:38.340 --> 11:39.820]  Gavin already made it over there, too.
[11:40.640 --> 11:42.540]  No, I'm quietly not making it.
[11:42.720 --> 11:43.200]  Oh, shit!
[11:48.360 --> 11:49.100]  There it is.
[11:49.780 --> 11:49.940]  No!
[11:51.760 --> 11:52.880]  Get in! Get in!
[11:53.100 --> 11:53.620]  Damn it!
[11:55.040 --> 11:57.140]  Oh, did you bounce off of Gavin?
[11:57.280 --> 11:59.060]  I smashed into him, and I almost
[11:59.620 --> 12:00.820]  got off it.
[12:03.380 --> 12:03.880]  No!
[12:04.980 --> 12:05.900]  Oh, Geoff.
[12:07.500 --> 12:08.420]  Oh, Geoff.
[12:09.180 --> 12:10.260]  He's a river boy.
[12:15.830 --> 12:17.450]  Geoff, you don't have to go that way.
[12:20.010 --> 12:21.610]  Well, what way should I go?
[12:21.610 --> 12:24.150]  You can go right. You can bounce off the right.
[12:24.250 --> 12:25.310]  You gotta go right, ultimately.
[12:27.070 --> 12:28.190]  Gavin, you've only hit two times.
[12:28.710 --> 12:29.150]  You got it.
[12:29.970 --> 12:31.690]  Don't do it. He's waiting for you to move him closer.
[12:32.030 --> 12:33.190]  Yep, I know.
[12:33.970 --> 12:35.130]  Just block his path.
[12:35.750 --> 12:36.590]  A little too many beans.
[12:37.490 --> 12:40.030]  I was trying to go to the next course. Maybe be alone.
[12:45.350 --> 12:46.510]  Geoff, me and you, buddy.
[12:48.950 --> 12:49.670]  Too hard.
[12:53.530 --> 12:54.030]  Gary!
[12:54.430 --> 12:54.710]  What?
[13:03.550 --> 13:04.830]  Look at this stupid deer.
[13:05.010 --> 13:07.050]  Spin your camera around and look at this stupid fucking guy.
[13:07.230 --> 13:08.950]  Look at this idiot. Dumbass.
[13:13.160 --> 13:15.520]  We're gonna catch Gavin. That's the rule here.
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.340]  You're hyper-focused on the wrong person, Nick.
[13:19.100 --> 13:20.360]  I gotta beat you, Gavin.
[13:23.560 --> 13:25.960]  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[13:26.980 --> 13:28.780]  What's that side path about?
[13:29.220 --> 13:30.360]  That's what I'm wanna know.
[13:31.160 --> 13:31.380]  Oops.
[13:32.500 --> 13:34.640]  Are you kidding me? Reset.
[13:34.760 --> 13:36.440]  Come on, I'm in my boat. Reset.
[13:37.960 --> 13:38.640]  There we go.
[13:39.460 --> 13:40.440]  Oh, this is less than ideal.
[13:40.540 --> 13:41.260]  There it is. There we go.
[13:42.400 --> 13:43.680]  I went the dog shit way.
[13:44.220 --> 13:44.720]  Yeah, me too.
[13:47.140 --> 13:47.600]  I'm in.
[13:48.320 --> 13:49.420]  Why is there a dog shit?
[13:49.420 --> 13:51.160]  You could've murdered me there.
[13:51.440 --> 13:52.240]  Yeah, I didn't see you.
[13:52.300 --> 13:56.920]  If I knew you were there, I would've destroyed you.
[13:56.920 --> 13:58.100]  Geoff's in a boat.
[13:59.280 --> 14:00.140]  Go, Geoff, go.
[14:00.260 --> 14:01.040]  He's dredging.
[14:05.750 --> 14:06.270]  Nice.
[14:06.730 --> 14:07.210]  Come on.
[14:08.150 --> 14:09.330]  Just roll in.
[14:14.410 --> 14:16.330]  I fucking hate this game.
[14:16.750 --> 14:17.350]  I'm sorry.
[14:19.130 --> 14:20.270]  It's okay. It's not you, Nick.
[14:20.330 --> 14:22.010]  It's years and years of scars.
[14:23.310 --> 14:24.410]  Which one do we go with?
[14:24.570 --> 14:26.130]  I'm gonna pick a hole.
[14:27.590 --> 14:28.350]  Bad hole.
[14:30.070 --> 14:31.110]  Good hole.
[14:32.170 --> 14:33.090]  Good hole.
[14:33.330 --> 14:34.330]  Good hole?
[14:37.130 --> 14:37.770]  Hmm.
[14:39.390 --> 14:40.470]  Which hole
[14:40.470 --> 14:41.490]  for the gold?
[14:42.330 --> 14:42.970]  I want this one.
[14:44.670 --> 14:46.230]  Oh, that was the good one.
[14:46.610 --> 14:47.430]  Why don't you guys go in that hole?
[14:47.430 --> 14:47.590]  Ah!
[14:49.970 --> 14:50.610]  Shit.
[14:52.510 --> 14:53.390]  There we go.
[14:53.870 --> 14:55.030]  Right there. Easy.
[14:55.030 --> 14:55.970]  Simple.
[14:58.850 --> 15:00.270]  Goodbye, my friend.
[15:00.270 --> 15:00.950]  Geoff, I got you.
[15:01.810 --> 15:02.230]  Geoff!
[15:03.310 --> 15:05.090]  My name's Jave.
[15:06.290 --> 15:06.950]  Get it?
[15:07.690 --> 15:10.670]  Oh, I overshot it.
[15:11.710 --> 15:12.850]  Yeah, Geoff!
[15:14.670 --> 15:15.750]  There we go.
[15:16.610 --> 15:17.590]  Here he comes.
[15:18.190 --> 15:20.430]  It's just Eric and Gavin.
[15:20.630 --> 15:20.930]  What?
[15:21.990 --> 15:22.670]  Here he comes.
[15:23.310 --> 15:23.670]  Oh.
[15:25.710 --> 15:26.630]  Encounter, I will kill.
[15:27.110 --> 15:27.570]  Here he comes.
[15:28.810 --> 15:30.330]  Eric, he's gonna hit it if you don't get him.
[15:30.810 --> 15:31.110]  Yeah!
[15:32.410 --> 15:33.230]  Oh, he's coming back, Eric.
[15:36.090 --> 15:36.690]  Now what?
[15:37.230 --> 15:37.470]  Oh.
[15:40.410 --> 15:41.710]  Oh, he's coming back, Eric!
[15:42.570 --> 15:43.510]  Oh, he missed it again.
[15:43.730 --> 15:44.170]  Oh, no!
[15:47.860 --> 15:49.280]  Get me that goddamn out of here.
[15:53.700 --> 15:55.760]  And I'll just slide gently into the hole.
[15:55.980 --> 15:56.540]  Yeah.
[15:56.740 --> 15:59.040]  Nice to follow your prey to the next hole.
[16:00.720 --> 16:02.560]  Oh, no, it's tense.
[16:02.820 --> 16:03.540]  It's tight.
[16:04.720 --> 16:06.400]  How do I make up 40 strokes?
[16:08.540 --> 16:08.860]  Ow!
[16:09.160 --> 16:10.840]  Hole idea by Gyro.
[16:10.840 --> 16:12.120]  Oh, this looks bad.
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.540]  Well, uh-oh.
[16:17.420 --> 16:17.720]  Uh-oh.
[16:17.860 --> 16:19.280]  Fuck yourself.
[16:19.280 --> 16:19.580]  Fuck yourself.
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.780]  I got a hole in one.
[16:24.440 --> 16:24.920]  No!
[16:27.380 --> 16:29.080]  I got a hole in one.
[16:29.480 --> 16:31.400]  If I didn't smash my face so hard
[16:31.400 --> 16:32.380]  the first time, that would have been
[16:33.080 --> 16:34.020]  an ideal run.
[16:35.240 --> 16:36.020]  Oh, Nick.
[16:36.680 --> 16:37.700]  Oh, it's going poorly.
[16:38.460 --> 16:39.260]  He's struggling.
[16:40.480 --> 16:43.280]  Let's get a nice cam of this, a nice angle of Nick's...
[16:44.720 --> 16:45.200]  frustrations.
[16:45.700 --> 16:46.380]  Oh, all right.
[16:46.980 --> 16:47.880]  That's looking good.
[16:47.940 --> 16:49.220]  There you go.
[16:50.200 --> 16:50.780]  Yeah!
[16:53.960 --> 16:55.480]  Nick with a five.
[16:56.260 --> 16:57.880]  Not good for me.
[16:59.180 --> 16:59.740]  Oh, I'm tied with Andrew.
[16:59.740 --> 17:00.440]  Andrew's tied.
[17:02.100 --> 17:03.640]  Five behind Gavin.
[17:03.980 --> 17:04.780]  Hole in one right here.
[17:06.000 --> 17:06.980]  Oh, fuck.
[17:08.460 --> 17:09.440]  For me!
[17:10.860 --> 17:12.180]  Oh, great hit, Nick.
[17:12.340 --> 17:13.140]  Thank you.
[17:13.740 --> 17:15.300]  Oh, great hit, Gavin!
[17:15.560 --> 17:16.320]  Andrew, I got...
[17:16.320 --> 17:18.340]  Gavin, don't.
[17:18.920 --> 17:19.940]  Here's the thing, Nick.
[17:21.300 --> 17:23.500]  You're a real piece of shit, Gavin.
[17:23.760 --> 17:24.640]  You're a...
[17:25.420 --> 17:26.360]  Oh, shit!
[17:28.800 --> 17:29.820]  Gotta go, gotta go!
[17:34.080 --> 17:35.380]  Take 500 shots.
[17:35.840 --> 17:36.620]  That's not a good achievement.
[17:37.740 --> 17:39.040]  That's not a good achievement.
[17:43.840 --> 17:44.740]  Oh, my God.
[17:44.820 --> 17:46.400]  I didn't know Eric was that close to me.
[17:46.460 --> 17:47.360]  I was just hanging out.
[17:48.360 --> 17:50.460]  Look at him. Behold.
[17:51.480 --> 17:51.920]  Behold.
[17:52.420 --> 17:53.700]  So beautiful.
[17:54.420 --> 17:55.360]  What do you mean?
[17:56.360 --> 17:57.240]  He's beautiful.
[17:57.820 --> 18:00.540]  I like that he glows with the toadstool.
[18:00.960 --> 18:02.520]  He looks like a little monster.
[18:03.280 --> 18:04.240]  We tied the hole, Nick.
[18:04.760 --> 18:05.080]  Wow.
[18:07.620 --> 18:08.660]  Three, two, one, go!
[18:09.660 --> 18:10.460]  No, he...
[18:10.460 --> 18:11.940]  Oh, I thought he made it.
[18:12.080 --> 18:12.800]  Three, two, one, go!
[18:13.900 --> 18:14.440]  Oh, no!
[18:16.300 --> 18:17.120]  Stop the clock!
[18:17.620 --> 18:17.920]  Nick, ready?
[18:20.660 --> 18:21.540]  Bless you, sir.
[18:21.700 --> 18:22.320]  Are we dead?
[18:23.320 --> 18:24.740]  I think we might be dead.
[18:26.200 --> 18:26.860]  You want to try again?
[18:27.340 --> 18:28.920]  Oh, my God.
[18:29.480 --> 18:30.180]  Did you see that?
[18:30.360 --> 18:32.300]  Did you see that angles?
[18:32.660 --> 18:33.260]  How did they work?
[18:37.640 --> 18:38.000]  Dickhead.
[18:39.220 --> 18:40.180]  Dickhead that is Geoff.
[18:40.320 --> 18:41.260]  Oh, no.
[18:43.660 --> 18:44.420]  Come again.
[18:47.220 --> 18:48.680]  Don't let him get ground.
[18:48.820 --> 18:49.340]  You can't hit me, Eric.
[18:49.720 --> 18:49.980]  Oh!
[18:52.140 --> 18:53.300]  Eric, you can't hit me.
[18:55.180 --> 18:56.360]  Just roll in front of him.
[18:56.620 --> 18:57.960]  He hasn't taken any shots.
[18:59.240 --> 19:00.100]  Roll in front of him.
[19:00.300 --> 19:00.780]  Get it.
[19:02.200 --> 19:02.580]  No.
[19:04.300 --> 19:05.720]  You suck. You haven't hit me yet.
[19:06.440 --> 19:07.120]  I can't.
[19:07.480 --> 19:09.960]  I'm just shooting blind and it's the best.
[19:10.220 --> 19:11.120]  Yeah, shoot blind, idiot.
[19:11.280 --> 19:11.700]  Oh, shit.
[19:14.120 --> 19:16.080]  Now just roll in front of the hole casually.
[19:17.700 --> 19:19.740]  Just casually put yourself right in front of the hole, Eric,
[19:19.820 --> 19:20.580]  and wait him out.
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.160]  Yeah, well...
[19:23.160 --> 19:24.460]  I ran out of shots.
[19:24.980 --> 19:25.340]  No!
[19:26.320 --> 19:27.260]  I ran out of shots.
[19:30.560 --> 19:31.140]  Oh, Nick,
[19:31.300 --> 19:32.280]  you're up too on that one.
[19:32.280 --> 19:32.640]  Oh, shit.
[19:33.600 --> 19:35.920]  I'm trying to get that achievement that Gavin got.
[19:37.520 --> 19:39.680]  You might get it in, like, I don't know, two videos.
[19:40.720 --> 19:41.300]  Oh, no!
[19:41.800 --> 19:43.040]  Where did we go?
[19:44.420 --> 19:45.900]  Where the damn hole at?
[19:47.140 --> 19:49.440]  Where the hole, where the hole, where the hole at?
[19:50.560 --> 19:51.220]  Oh, no. No!
[19:51.560 --> 19:52.120]  Too much.
[19:53.880 --> 19:55.300]  All right, Andrew, here you go.
[19:56.820 --> 19:57.380]  Thank you.
[19:58.020 --> 19:58.900]  Thank you.
[20:01.300 --> 20:02.980]  Damn it to hell, Andrew!
[20:03.780 --> 20:05.040]  I didn't do anything.
[20:05.280 --> 20:06.420]  I hit you.
[20:07.220 --> 20:08.500]  You sure did, it helped,
[20:08.640 --> 20:09.740]  but I didn't put myself there.
[20:10.140 --> 20:10.680]  Oh, Eric.
[20:12.320 --> 20:13.500]  There's a gap there, Gavin.
[20:14.800 --> 20:15.700]  Fuck me.
[20:19.040 --> 20:20.080]  Yeah, lots of beans.
[20:21.020 --> 20:23.040]  Okay, too many.
[20:23.620 --> 20:25.520]  Is this another freaking jump?
[20:26.640 --> 20:27.620]  No, not enough beans.
[20:27.620 --> 20:28.640]  I don't know where he came from.
[20:29.480 --> 20:30.080]  What did you say?
[20:30.240 --> 20:30.820]  Are you going to go back up the hill?
[20:31.160 --> 20:32.120]  Yeah, I'm coming back up.
[20:33.100 --> 20:33.500]  Fuck!
[20:42.720 --> 20:44.060]  Oh, it's so close.
[20:44.320 --> 20:45.660]  Oh, I have so many beans to
[20:46.820 --> 20:47.220]  release.
[20:47.560 --> 20:48.120]  Ah, shit!
[20:50.420 --> 20:52.020]  Oh, no, you have to go really crazy.
[20:52.520 --> 20:53.580]  Yeah, you got to go full balls.
[20:53.860 --> 20:54.140]  Almost.
[20:55.820 --> 20:57.420]  Okay, a little under full balls.
[20:58.840 --> 20:59.340]  There it is.
[21:00.920 --> 21:01.800]  No way!
[21:02.940 --> 21:04.040]  Dude, did that really hit you?
[21:04.360 --> 21:06.180]  Wow, how did that happen?
[21:06.300 --> 21:06.940]  That was crazy.
[21:08.140 --> 21:09.140]  That was wild.
[21:10.220 --> 21:11.580]  Ah, I pissed and shit.
[21:12.900 --> 21:13.800]  I got you, Geoff.
[21:15.040 --> 21:15.740]  Thanks, man.
[21:15.940 --> 21:16.480]  Oh, Gavin!
[21:17.440 --> 21:17.920]  Gavin!
[21:18.760 --> 21:19.240]  Shitbag!
[21:22.360 --> 21:23.920]  Are you waiting, Eric?
[21:24.260 --> 21:24.880]  Are you waiting there?
[21:26.040 --> 21:27.100]  You got me there!
[21:27.100 --> 21:28.960]  The lonely night watchman.
[21:29.480 --> 21:29.820]  Guards.
[21:30.780 --> 21:32.320]  Kill him! Kill him!
[21:34.700 --> 21:36.220]  I'm out of shots.
[21:38.300 --> 21:40.400]  I think Nick might have won.
[21:41.320 --> 21:42.700]  Wow, look at this.
[21:43.220 --> 21:43.800]  He's up.
[21:44.840 --> 21:45.500]  Disaster.
[21:46.140 --> 21:47.780]  Three holes.
[21:48.100 --> 21:49.600]  What a fat schmuck.
[21:49.840 --> 21:51.780]  Oh, I almost had that in one go.
[21:57.400 --> 22:00.300]  Oh, I did that so wrong.
[22:01.780 --> 22:02.520]  There we go.
[22:03.720 --> 22:05.460]  Wait, what? It dumped me in the dirt!
[22:05.840 --> 22:06.620]  It dumped me in the dirt!
[22:07.240 --> 22:08.120]  Where do you belong?
[22:08.420 --> 22:09.320]  Oh, come on.
[22:13.240 --> 22:14.780]  Just a little over...
[22:14.780 --> 22:17.400]  A little over three quarters and I think you're there.
[22:17.440 --> 22:18.340]  No, the dirt!
[22:18.820 --> 22:20.720]  Wow, this is a real son of a bitch.
[22:21.880 --> 22:22.980]  You gotta get full beans.
[22:23.380 --> 22:23.840]  No, you don't.
[22:24.380 --> 22:25.160]  Oh, god damn it.
[22:25.160 --> 22:25.640]  Roll the beans.
[22:30.750 --> 22:32.690]  Roll, you little son of a bitch.
[22:32.730 --> 22:33.990]  I'm gonna run out of time.
[22:34.570 --> 22:35.410]  I gotcha. Here.
[22:37.250 --> 22:38.250]  Look, Eric is still rolling.
[22:38.250 --> 22:39.450]  Oh, I can't. I'm rolling too.
[22:40.510 --> 22:42.190]  Eric will never make it.
[22:43.270 --> 22:44.570]  Eric's chasing him down.
[22:50.910 --> 22:55.290]  It's so close.
[22:55.290 --> 22:55.610]  It's so close.
[22:56.730 --> 22:59.490]  Yeah, but normally...
[22:59.490 --> 23:00.710]  I'm gonna wait this out.
[23:00.710 --> 23:01.730]  Oh, my god.
[23:03.830 --> 23:04.510]  How close?
[23:04.890 --> 23:05.310]  Yes!
[23:06.970 --> 23:08.170]  Eric, smash him up.
[23:09.190 --> 23:10.830]  I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know where you are.
[23:12.430 --> 23:13.230]  Are you gonna help me, buddy?
[23:13.670 --> 23:13.830]  Sure.
[23:15.950 --> 23:17.250]  Yes, now leave him.
[23:17.510 --> 23:18.870]  Leave him there, Eric. That's fine.
[23:19.490 --> 23:20.670]  I can't see anything.
[23:21.490 --> 23:21.730]  Eric.
[23:21.730 --> 23:23.530]  Oh, I don't have time for this.
[23:23.990 --> 23:24.810]  Oh, god.
[23:24.970 --> 23:26.050]  Eric, smash him.
[23:26.270 --> 23:26.650]  Eric.
[23:28.970 --> 23:29.930]  Stop rolling.
[23:46.560 --> 23:49.060]  That was the scariest shit I've ever seen.
[23:50.600 --> 23:51.140]  Oh, god.
[23:51.140 --> 23:53.840]  That was incredibly tense after spending a year in the gutter.
[23:56.100 --> 23:56.860]  Oh, god.
[23:57.680 --> 23:58.380]  All the way.
[23:59.200 --> 24:00.040]  Don't go this way.
[24:01.520 --> 24:02.060]  Oh.
[24:03.020 --> 24:04.060]  It's a waterman.
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.320]  Oh, no, I hit the button.
[24:07.020 --> 24:07.280]  Wait.
[24:07.840 --> 24:11.120]  Are we supposed to get to the...
[24:11.120 --> 24:12.140]  Where is it?
[24:12.800 --> 24:14.640]  Oh, it's down there.
[24:16.580 --> 24:17.720]  Oh, man.
[24:20.620 --> 24:21.520]  Oh, man.
[24:21.520 --> 24:22.660]  Oh, you're a little...
[24:22.660 --> 24:22.860]  Okay.
[24:26.220 --> 24:26.700]  Okay.
[24:28.320 --> 24:29.120]  Okay.
[24:30.180 --> 24:31.540]  There we go.
[24:32.460 --> 24:33.540]  Hello, Jafe.
[24:34.120 --> 24:35.820]  Good to see you.
[24:38.660 --> 24:40.260]  Oh, god.
[24:40.540 --> 24:41.340]  Oh, no.
[24:41.340 --> 24:41.900]  What?
[24:44.360 --> 24:45.380]  The monster.
[24:45.860 --> 24:46.700]  Oh, shit.
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.280]  Uh-oh.
[24:49.520 --> 24:50.620]  The monster's here.
[24:55.280 --> 24:56.760]  We can stop rolling.
[24:57.360 --> 24:57.780]  Thank you.
[24:58.160 --> 24:58.580]  Goodbye, Gavin.
[24:58.680 --> 25:00.040]  No, Andrew.
[25:01.280 --> 25:01.920]  No.
[25:03.020 --> 25:05.260]  I'm sorry, Nick.
[25:06.160 --> 25:07.420]  Nick, I'm so sorry.
[25:07.800 --> 25:08.820]  Nick, I'm so sorry.
[25:08.960 --> 25:11.800]  I can't. I won't stop rolling.
[25:11.800 --> 25:13.320]  I'm on it. Follows time.
[25:13.400 --> 25:14.780]  I gotta get out of here.
[25:16.580 --> 25:17.520]  Oh, no.
[25:19.040 --> 25:20.340]  Look at his face.
[25:20.400 --> 25:22.160]  I hate him so much.
[25:22.320 --> 25:23.720]  I hate him so much.
[25:24.180 --> 25:25.600]  I hate him. Look at his face.
[25:25.740 --> 25:26.580]  I hate him.
[25:29.680 --> 25:30.400]  Go in the hole.
[25:35.100 --> 25:37.920]  Alright, where are we?
[25:38.220 --> 25:39.620]  Oh, my god.
[25:40.660 --> 25:42.700]  Andrew takes the lead with one hole.
[25:43.260 --> 25:44.500]  75, 76, 77.
[25:44.680 --> 25:44.860]  Oh, boy.
[25:45.220 --> 25:46.440]  Where are we supposed to go to the right?
[25:46.440 --> 25:47.480]  Are we going to the minecarts?
[25:50.400 --> 25:51.240]  Minecarts. Minecraft.
[25:54.600 --> 25:55.960]  How'd that work out for you guys?
[25:56.580 --> 25:56.820]  What?
[25:57.220 --> 25:57.620]  Not great.
[25:57.960 --> 25:59.080]  Dude, it didn't count.
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.700]  I don't know where we're supposed to go.
[26:04.760 --> 26:05.000]  Hole.
[26:06.060 --> 26:06.480]  Thanks, man.
[26:07.780 --> 26:08.580]  You're fucking dead.
[26:10.240 --> 26:11.680]  Oh, shit.
[26:14.660 --> 26:15.640]  Damn it.
[26:16.300 --> 26:17.600]  Oh, that was bad.
[26:18.680 --> 26:20.100]  I was trying to jump still.
[26:20.180 --> 26:21.040]  I wasn't even hit.
[26:21.640 --> 26:22.260]  Yes.
[26:22.920 --> 26:24.140]  No, wrong.
[26:27.000 --> 26:27.720]  Sausage.
[26:32.420 --> 26:34.060]  Geoff, you fuck.
[26:35.280 --> 26:36.840]  You son of a bitch.
[26:36.840 --> 26:37.840]  You're in my way.
[26:40.320 --> 26:40.780]  Geoff.
[26:41.380 --> 26:42.280]  You fuck.
[26:42.420 --> 26:42.920]  You're in my way.
[26:45.480 --> 26:45.940]  Hey.
[26:46.900 --> 26:47.360]  Fuck.
[26:47.440 --> 26:48.260]  Why'd you hit me?
[26:48.260 --> 26:48.700]  Oh.
[27:01.380 --> 27:02.140]  It's over.
[27:03.060 --> 27:03.500]  It's done.
[27:04.680 --> 27:06.600]  Why'd I get hit? I didn't even do anything.
[27:10.240 --> 27:12.800]  We're going to have to do a second round. This is too short.
[27:13.920 --> 27:14.700]  There it is.
[27:14.760 --> 27:15.920]  Oh, I see where... Oh, Geoff.
[27:16.720 --> 27:17.680]  Here you go, Geoff. I got you.
[27:18.320 --> 27:18.900]  No, I'm good.
[27:20.760 --> 27:23.080]  I'm less good than I was now. Thank you.
[27:23.380 --> 27:23.760]  What do you mean?
[27:25.480 --> 27:27.020]  It was so perfect.
[27:27.380 --> 27:28.760]  It was lined up so well.
[27:30.180 --> 27:30.760]  Wrong way.
[27:31.640 --> 27:33.400]  What kind of hole is this, though?
[27:33.600 --> 27:34.080]  Crazy hole.
[27:34.100 --> 27:36.140]  I just had to watch Geoff for 40 minutes.
[27:36.280 --> 27:37.840]  Just not be able to shoot straight.
[27:38.940 --> 27:40.840]  He didn't even utilize it.
[27:43.820 --> 27:44.540]  It's in the hole.
[27:44.620 --> 27:45.380]  Oh, no.
[27:46.640 --> 27:48.380]  I ran out of time.
[27:50.060 --> 27:50.860]  That's a good hole.
[27:51.680 --> 27:52.260]  Who finished?
[27:52.700 --> 27:53.020]  I did.
[27:53.200 --> 27:54.300]  Son of a bitch.
[27:56.720 --> 27:57.940]  Way to go, bud.
[27:59.300 --> 28:00.180]  Thanks, man.
[28:00.240 --> 28:01.300]  Cute piece of shit.
[28:01.940 --> 28:03.280]  That was so close.
[28:03.680 --> 28:04.600]  That was the practice round.
[28:06.360 --> 28:07.240]  Practice round.
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.360]  I don't know what you're talking about, man.
[28:14.680 --> 28:21.580]  You can't just hang out on a pier all day long and not expect somebody to push you in.
[28:22.780 --> 28:25.160]  I was there for two seconds.
[28:26.680 --> 28:27.740]  Maybe next time.
[28:28.200 --> 28:29.940]  I was just lining up the shot.
[28:34.760 --> 28:35.800]  What a great video.
[28:36.480 --> 28:38.240]  Yeah, all right. Let's do round two.
[28:38.460 --> 28:39.160]  Where should we go?
[28:39.560 --> 28:40.120]  It's up to you.
[28:40.120 --> 28:40.700]  Where do you want to go?
[28:41.060 --> 28:42.120]  You want to go to the Pirate Cove?
[28:42.300 --> 28:43.480]  Or Candyland?
[28:44.120 --> 28:45.280]  That sounds fun.
[28:45.400 --> 28:47.800]  All right, let's do it.
[28:48.060 --> 28:48.360]  You ready?
[28:51.680 --> 28:52.700]  That's what I saw.
[28:53.500 --> 28:56.120]  I've got to get those 500 strokes.
[29:01.820 --> 29:03.180]  I'm going to do three quarters beans.
[29:06.200 --> 29:07.620]  Well, I thought we got through.
[29:08.160 --> 29:12.140]  I saw someone go into the distance and then come floating down the river.
[29:12.160 --> 29:12.540]  It was great.
[29:12.980 --> 29:13.880]  That was me.
[29:19.120 --> 29:19.960]  Oh, wow.
[29:20.680 --> 29:22.860]  Gavin just annihilated me.
[29:22.880 --> 29:24.040]  No, I'm back at the beginning.
[29:24.620 --> 29:26.740]  That rule that I went in the hole with you too.
[29:28.480 --> 29:30.880]  Are you shitting me?
[29:33.480 --> 29:34.660]  Come on, Nick.
[29:34.660 --> 29:34.960]  Come on, Nick.
[29:35.060 --> 29:35.720]  You can do it.
[29:35.720 --> 29:36.440]  You got it, Nick.
[29:38.480 --> 29:40.580]  Is this activating your kill instinct?
[29:40.960 --> 29:41.540]  Oh, there we go.
[29:42.240 --> 29:43.560]  Urge to kill rising.
[29:44.660 --> 29:45.720]  I say we just stop right now.
[29:46.580 --> 29:49.040]  2, 2, 2, 3.
[29:49.240 --> 29:49.580]  Pretty close.
[29:50.440 --> 29:52.980]  Does your kill instinct calm down if you're in first?
[29:53.660 --> 29:54.600]  Yeah, definitely.
[29:55.960 --> 29:57.660]  I'm playing, playing, and I'm trying.
[29:57.940 --> 29:58.320]  Hey, fellas.
[29:58.320 --> 29:59.820]  Yes, he's back.
[30:01.680 --> 30:03.360]  I'm going to need some more beans.
[30:04.820 --> 30:05.620]  There we go.
[30:05.800 --> 30:06.380]  A little hook shot.
[30:09.840 --> 30:11.320]  Lovely little paw.
[30:12.080 --> 30:12.960]  Could have used more beans.
[30:13.760 --> 30:14.560]  That's alright.
[30:19.820 --> 30:20.740]  Nice, Geoff.
[30:21.080 --> 30:21.500]  Thank you.
[30:22.280 --> 30:24.220]  Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim.
[30:28.340 --> 30:29.380]  Yes, yes.
[30:29.520 --> 30:30.540]  Oh, you cunt.
[30:32.680 --> 30:34.100]  I fucking hate this game.
[30:36.520 --> 30:37.640]  I've never said that before.
[30:37.720 --> 30:38.760]  I fucking hate golf.
[30:39.760 --> 30:40.880]  Oh, Nick with the one.
[30:41.320 --> 30:41.860]  Yeah, baby.
[30:43.280 --> 30:44.240]  Oh, dear.
[30:45.880 --> 30:46.220]  Gotta shoot.
[30:46.220 --> 30:47.420]  The hole on the right.
[30:52.040 --> 30:52.620]  Oops.
[30:55.800 --> 30:56.800]  So close.
[30:57.380 --> 30:59.440]  Oh, I'm going to get squashed.
[30:59.960 --> 31:02.620]  Oh, another.
[31:02.960 --> 31:03.960]  Oh, cool, there's more.
[31:05.950 --> 31:06.680]  I got you, Nick.
[31:07.840 --> 31:08.420]  No!
[31:11.900 --> 31:12.860]  I was in the middle.
[31:12.860 --> 31:13.220]  Oh, you're right here.
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.200]  You're helping.
[31:16.600 --> 31:16.760]  Yeah.
[31:18.400 --> 31:20.560]  Is this what it's like to be around me on the other show?
[31:21.840 --> 31:22.320]  Yeah.
[31:23.660 --> 31:24.540]  There we go.
[31:25.940 --> 31:26.860]  Now I wait.
[31:27.420 --> 31:27.760]  What?
[31:30.760 --> 31:32.460]  Wait with bated breath.
[31:32.460 --> 31:34.480]  As we loop, circle,
[31:35.100 --> 31:36.640]  and we've
[31:36.640 --> 31:37.520]  made it in in six.
[31:39.780 --> 31:40.320]  Shitty
[31:40.320 --> 31:41.220]  dog shit hole.
[31:41.220 --> 31:41.860]  You suck.
[31:42.020 --> 31:43.720]  You're stupid.
[31:44.380 --> 31:46.740]  Cookie, piece of shit, Oreo, wank.
[31:51.140 --> 31:52.280]  If I hit you.
[31:53.200 --> 31:54.760]  Oh, it's all right, you'll stop right here.
[31:54.960 --> 31:56.080]  Yeah, I'm getting right here.
[32:00.870 --> 32:02.590]  Go in the fucking hole, you idiot!
[32:06.770 --> 32:07.170]  Idiot!
[32:14.970 --> 32:16.770]  He's screaming and it's too loud.
[32:17.530 --> 32:22.170]  Oh, Gavin.
[32:22.710 --> 32:24.450]  Gavin, you've activated something
[32:24.450 --> 32:25.010]  within me.
[32:26.450 --> 32:27.470]  Yes, you did.
[32:28.490 --> 32:30.590]  How? This is the first shot.
[32:30.970 --> 32:32.530]  I don't know how the fuck
[32:32.530 --> 32:33.870]  you did it, but you did it.
[32:34.370 --> 32:36.170]  Yeah, but if I didn't mean to do it...
[32:36.170 --> 32:37.470]  You're fucking dead.
[32:41.070 --> 32:41.430]  Oh!
[32:42.350 --> 32:42.690]  There we go.
[32:42.850 --> 32:44.990]  Me and Geoff hanging out, having fun, being friends.
[32:45.390 --> 32:45.850]  Hey, fellas.
[32:46.950 --> 32:47.310]  Hello.
[32:49.470 --> 32:50.450]  Here you go, Geoff, I got you.
[32:51.490 --> 32:53.250]  Bogus. Well, thank you.
[32:53.510 --> 32:55.190]  Geoff, I told you I got you.
[32:55.910 --> 32:57.750]  I want everyone to be having a good time.
[33:00.130 --> 33:01.310]  First bar of the day and somebody
[33:01.310 --> 33:03.250]  gave it to me. I'll take it.
[33:05.990 --> 33:07.110]  Where are we?
[33:11.030 --> 33:12.270]  Don't do that.
[33:12.590 --> 33:15.610]  How many beans are you guys doing here?
[33:15.790 --> 33:16.670]  Lots of beans!
[33:21.090 --> 33:22.210]  Fuck, don't do that.
[33:23.430 --> 33:24.130]  There it is.
[33:24.170 --> 33:24.510]  No!
[33:24.910 --> 33:26.710]  Dick, dick, dick.
[33:28.130 --> 33:28.510]  Hey, bud.
[33:30.730 --> 33:31.330]  Somehow...
[33:31.330 --> 33:32.230]  You fucked me, Gavin.
[33:32.230 --> 33:33.930]  You fucked me real good.
[33:34.390 --> 33:36.610]  Is he activating something within you?
[33:36.870 --> 33:37.310]  Yeah.
[33:38.030 --> 33:40.170]  A rage that I never knew was possible.
[33:40.350 --> 33:40.890]  Here, Nick, I got you.
[33:41.710 --> 33:42.590]  The rage?
[33:43.630 --> 33:45.790]  You sure you got the rage for the deer?
[33:46.850 --> 33:47.130]  Oh.
[33:48.490 --> 33:50.150]  The deer just gave me
[33:50.870 --> 33:52.390]  a double bogey.
[33:52.610 --> 33:52.770]  Nice.
[33:53.390 --> 33:55.970]  I hit you so I could go in the hole, but that works too.
[33:56.730 --> 33:57.950]  Listen, we helped each other.
[33:59.610 --> 34:00.710]  Real bros being bros
[34:00.710 --> 34:01.190]  in this situation.
[34:01.490 --> 34:01.910]  Yeah, whatever.
[34:04.750 --> 34:05.770]  Oh, Gavin.
[34:06.070 --> 34:06.370]  No.
[34:09.010 --> 34:09.570]  Gavin.
[34:13.460 --> 34:14.020]  Okay.
[34:17.700 --> 34:18.260]  Splat!
[34:19.880 --> 34:20.560]  Oh, no.
[34:20.720 --> 34:21.020]  Oh, no.
[34:21.120 --> 34:22.600]  Oh, there's water!
[34:24.540 --> 34:24.800]  Get up!
[34:25.940 --> 34:26.600]  No, it's solids.
[34:27.360 --> 34:28.440]  Oh, dammit, Geoff.
[34:28.440 --> 34:29.700]  Thank you, man.
[34:30.040 --> 34:31.660]  Oh, oh.
[34:31.940 --> 34:35.300]  Geoff, make it back on land.
[34:35.560 --> 34:35.700]  Make it.
[34:36.480 --> 34:37.740]  Geoff, you...
[34:40.120 --> 34:41.980]  Yes. Yes.
[34:44.300 --> 34:45.860]  I hate water!
[34:48.070 --> 34:50.780]  That was not ideal for me, that one.
[34:52.620 --> 34:53.440]  No!
[34:54.080 --> 34:54.280]  Okay.
[34:54.280 --> 34:54.400]  Okay.
[34:57.840 --> 34:58.320]  Activate.
[34:58.960 --> 35:00.040]  Yes, yes, yes.
[35:00.920 --> 35:02.280]  Hey, where are you...
[35:03.880 --> 35:04.640]  Where are you going?
[35:13.240 --> 35:14.120]  Activate, activate.
[35:14.360 --> 35:15.480]  Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm scared.
[35:15.700 --> 35:16.020]  No!
[35:18.960 --> 35:19.440]  Yes!
[35:23.780 --> 35:24.560]  Oh, dammit.
[35:25.760 --> 35:27.440]  Why did you take so long?
[35:27.860 --> 35:29.740]  I was lining up the shot.
[35:30.340 --> 35:31.680]  Good God, man.
[35:35.860 --> 35:36.500]  Activated.
[35:38.000 --> 35:38.640]  Twelve.
[35:39.840 --> 35:41.580]  That takes the lead by two.
[35:43.060 --> 35:44.260]  Oh, boy.
[35:45.220 --> 35:45.920]  I'll mention it.
[35:46.620 --> 35:47.900]  Might mention it again.
[35:48.400 --> 35:49.260]  Barely mentioned.
[35:50.420 --> 35:51.040]  Oh, thank you.
[35:59.440 --> 36:00.240]  That's a...
[36:00.240 --> 36:01.400]  We got a pileup over here.
[36:03.860 --> 36:04.320]  Uh-oh.
[36:04.720 --> 36:05.240]  Whoa!
[36:05.900 --> 36:07.500]  Oh, shit. Who did that?
[36:08.700 --> 36:09.300]  No!
[36:09.740 --> 36:10.960]  You stupid...
[36:11.760 --> 36:12.360]  Bogey.
[36:13.260 --> 36:13.560]  Goddamn.
[36:15.700 --> 36:16.560]  Goodbye, friends.
[36:16.880 --> 36:17.920]  At the very beginning?
[36:18.600 --> 36:18.980]  Yeah!
[36:22.260 --> 36:23.400]  What the toss?
[36:23.460 --> 36:24.600]  Celebrating your misery, huh?
[36:25.720 --> 36:27.120]  He was ahead of me.
[36:27.340 --> 36:27.760]  Until now.
[36:28.500 --> 36:29.720]  I like your paper airplane, Andrew.
[36:31.480 --> 36:32.080]  Thanks.
[36:32.380 --> 36:33.420]  Stop, stop, stop.
[36:33.420 --> 36:34.280]  Where are you?
[36:35.440 --> 36:36.460]  Ball the other way.
[36:36.560 --> 36:38.520]  Oh, shit.
[36:39.000 --> 36:39.860]  That's good.
[36:41.520 --> 36:43.000]  You know where we are.
[36:43.100 --> 36:43.440]  In the hole.
[36:52.720 --> 36:53.680]  Anyone's game.
[36:55.880 --> 36:57.860]  You got to give it everything here.
[36:59.520 --> 37:00.440]  Bingo, bango.
[37:00.860 --> 37:01.760]  We got to get out of here.
[37:02.560 --> 37:03.080]  No!
[37:03.080 --> 37:03.420]  No!
[37:05.300 --> 37:06.260]  Oh, no!
[37:07.080 --> 37:08.320]  Oh, there's a gap.
[37:08.780 --> 37:09.580]  Yeah, there's a gap.
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.980]  Too many beans!
[37:15.340 --> 37:15.900]  Poor!
[37:16.800 --> 37:16.900]  Shit.
[37:19.200 --> 37:19.500]  Oh, no.
[37:21.320 --> 37:22.140]  That requires more beans.
[37:22.280 --> 37:22.800]  Moron!
[37:31.010 --> 37:35.350]  Oh, Gavin with the double jump.
[37:35.350 --> 37:36.310]  You're on the course right now, buddy.
[37:36.670 --> 37:37.650]  Yeah, dude, you suck. What's up?
[37:39.490 --> 37:40.590]  More beans, Gavin.
[37:40.750 --> 37:42.250]  You're not playing golf right now, right?
[37:42.370 --> 37:42.710]  Yeah, dude.
[37:43.890 --> 37:44.330]  Yeah!
[37:46.250 --> 37:46.690]  Six.
[37:49.710 --> 37:50.290]  I'm in.
[37:50.790 --> 37:51.230]  Shit!
[37:53.230 --> 37:54.310]  I'm coming for you.
[37:58.390 --> 37:59.550]  All he's scared of.
[38:01.730 --> 38:02.610]  Oh, shit!
[38:05.350 --> 38:06.430]  Uh-oh, here we go.
[38:06.750 --> 38:11.930]  I don't even know where the fuck I am.
[38:16.330 --> 38:17.190]  Where's the hole?
[38:18.650 --> 38:20.730]  Get the fuck out of here!
[38:21.530 --> 38:24.430]  Hey, Geoff.
[38:24.750 --> 38:25.130]  Hey, Nick.
[38:26.330 --> 38:27.950]  Well, Geoff, that didn't work.
[38:28.890 --> 38:31.010]  Oh, kill instinct rising.
[38:31.310 --> 38:31.490]  Oh, boy.
[38:31.490 --> 38:31.510]  Okay.
[38:32.470 --> 38:33.530]  Urge to kill.
[38:37.210 --> 38:46.570]  Nick, you worthless, stupid, dumb...
[38:46.570 --> 38:46.790]  Fuck.
[38:47.130 --> 38:47.770]  Andrew, full beans.
[38:50.230 --> 38:50.930]  Damn it.
[38:51.550 --> 38:52.470]  Little tap.
[38:53.270 --> 38:53.750]  Little tap.
[38:59.080 --> 39:00.740]  All right, well...
[39:00.740 --> 39:01.280]  Could've gone better.
[39:03.500 --> 39:05.140]  It's a fucked-up-looking hole.
[39:12.490 --> 39:12.890]  Uh...
[39:12.890 --> 39:13.630]  Oh!
[39:16.330 --> 39:16.730]  Ah!
[39:18.230 --> 39:18.630]  Fuck!
[39:19.950 --> 39:20.350]  Fuck!
[39:22.290 --> 39:23.090]  I'm so...
[39:23.090 --> 39:24.030]  Is that you, Gavin?
[39:25.810 --> 39:28.530]  I was trying to go full beans, and you just, like,
[39:28.550 --> 39:29.510]  ended up in front of me.
[39:29.570 --> 39:30.110]  That sucked.
[39:32.090 --> 39:32.630]  It did.
[39:32.650 --> 39:33.230]  Way to go, Geoff.
[39:34.510 --> 39:36.010]  Gavin sucks. What is this?
[39:36.650 --> 39:37.110]  What is what?
[39:37.930 --> 39:39.050]  Going down shit mills.
[39:39.190 --> 39:39.350]  No!
[39:40.870 --> 39:41.830]  Come on.
[39:42.150 --> 39:43.050]  My hubris.
[39:46.990 --> 39:48.050]  Tried to hit Andrew.
[39:48.910 --> 39:50.070]  Oh, Geoff with a two.
[39:50.470 --> 39:51.210]  Hey, shut up. Don't look.
[39:56.150 --> 39:56.630]  Um...
[39:56.630 --> 39:58.790]  Okay, let's read this course.
[39:59.290 --> 39:59.930]  Uh-oh.
[40:00.190 --> 40:01.910]  Fuck me. I'm a dumb son of a bitch.
[40:04.230 --> 40:04.910]  Mmm.
[40:06.910 --> 40:08.530]  That insanely worked.
[40:12.190 --> 40:12.870]  No!
[40:14.350 --> 40:15.630]  Oh, I've committed now.
[40:16.210 --> 40:16.430]  Par!
[40:18.170 --> 40:18.850]  Buddy.
[40:20.530 --> 40:21.950]  Throw that fucking bird.
[40:22.090 --> 40:22.490]  Hello!
[40:24.510 --> 40:26.570]  Geoff, are you out there?
[40:26.930 --> 40:28.430]  Oh, he's out there.
[40:28.650 --> 40:29.630]  I'm committed now.
[40:30.130 --> 40:30.890]  Alright, I'm gonna wait.
[40:30.890 --> 40:32.590]  It's like tin cup.
[40:36.890 --> 40:38.030]  Get in there, dick!
[40:38.470 --> 40:39.150]  Jump, jump!
[40:39.550 --> 40:40.070]  Okay.
[40:44.600 --> 40:45.460]  There he is.
[40:47.460 --> 40:48.080]  That's it.
[40:48.540 --> 40:49.200]  You're in.
[40:51.780 --> 40:52.560]  Nick, get him.
[40:53.840 --> 40:54.120]  Geoff.
[40:55.200 --> 40:56.200]  Aw, damn it.
[40:56.720 --> 40:57.740]  Oh, you stupid idiot!
[40:58.020 --> 40:59.620]  He almost fucked it up.
[41:02.400 --> 41:02.960]  Wow.
[41:03.620 --> 41:04.180]  Oh.
[41:04.500 --> 41:06.300]  Nick is down at the bottom with me, dumb style.
[41:06.940 --> 41:07.720]  Yeah, it's great.
[41:09.140 --> 41:10.200]  Oh my god!
[41:10.620 --> 41:12.640]  I hit the sign that says hole 12.
[41:14.880 --> 41:15.620]  Uh-oh.
[41:16.420 --> 41:18.460]  Watch out for the ramp.
[41:20.880 --> 41:22.000]  Damn it.
[41:23.040 --> 41:23.600]  Oh, fuck.
[41:24.380 --> 41:26.940]  Yeah, there's a gap.
[41:27.340 --> 41:27.640]  Whoops.
[41:27.640 --> 41:29.980]  Oh, bollocks.
[41:30.480 --> 41:31.620]  Oh, come on.
[41:31.660 --> 41:32.840]  That was too hard too, Jesus.
[41:33.460 --> 41:34.260]  Someone hit me.
[41:35.920 --> 41:36.540]  No!
[41:38.180 --> 41:39.300]  It's all falling apart.
[41:39.720 --> 41:40.120]  Oh, fuck.
[41:45.060 --> 41:46.710]  You absolute wankstain.
[41:50.280 --> 41:50.940]  No!
[41:52.460 --> 41:53.680]  Oh, no!
[41:53.680 --> 41:55.900]  It's going to be paw for me, Nick.
[41:59.860 --> 42:02.880]  Nick with the hard wankstain.
[42:04.360 --> 42:04.760]  No!
[42:10.880 --> 42:12.520]  Nice job, Eric.
[42:13.320 --> 42:14.340]  That's what you think.
[42:16.800 --> 42:18.020]  This is a great game.
[42:25.040 --> 42:26.160]  He did it!
[42:26.680 --> 42:28.200]  Well, I'm going to be out of strokes here.
[42:28.500 --> 42:29.560]  No, no, no. You got it.
[42:29.860 --> 42:34.720]  I just don't know why anyone said anything.
[42:35.520 --> 42:36.740]  Because you had it before that.
[42:38.140 --> 42:39.260]  Ran out of strokes.
[42:43.580 --> 42:44.720]  Andrew, what happened?
[42:44.840 --> 42:45.180]  Wow.
[42:45.880 --> 42:46.920]  That was bad.
[42:49.280 --> 42:49.980]  Hole in one.
[42:50.260 --> 42:52.860]  Holy shit, Eric. How many beans did you put on that?
[42:52.860 --> 42:54.180]  I'm not telling you.
[42:54.220 --> 42:55.380]  Man, really?
[42:55.640 --> 42:57.120]  Hole in one, baby!
[42:59.280 --> 42:59.880]  Shit.
[43:00.580 --> 43:02.680]  I watched Gavin fuck it up.
[43:04.780 --> 43:06.600]  Hello, chef. Welcome to the club.
[43:06.880 --> 43:08.880]  Oh, Gavin. I'm in the club.
[43:10.580 --> 43:10.880]  No!
[43:13.620 --> 43:15.740]  Andrew's having a struggle.
[43:16.380 --> 43:17.980]  Andrew's having a meh.
[43:19.240 --> 43:20.620]  You got it this time, Andrew.
[43:20.620 --> 43:22.820]  Fly your little paper airplane right into it.
[43:26.840 --> 43:29.160]  Maybe you can go under it, like in the first hole.
[43:33.860 --> 43:35.300]  This is phenomenal.
[43:36.540 --> 43:37.840]  Here we go. You got it.
[43:39.220 --> 43:39.940]  In for seven.
[43:49.820 --> 43:50.260]  Beans.
[43:50.260 --> 43:50.320]  Beans.
[43:52.200 --> 43:53.560]  Don't do that!
[44:00.160 --> 44:01.340]  What's all this about?
[44:01.520 --> 44:04.100]  One of these takes you back to the beginning, it looks like.
[44:05.320 --> 44:05.660]  Shit.
[44:06.100 --> 44:06.840]  Oh, piss.
[44:07.200 --> 44:08.080]  That was funny.
[44:08.600 --> 44:09.900]  Oh no, too far!
[44:13.780 --> 44:14.340]  No!
[44:14.640 --> 44:14.840]  No!
[44:16.420 --> 44:16.980]  Yes!
[44:26.100 --> 44:26.540]  What?
[44:26.820 --> 44:28.360]  Oh, how did that bounce happen?
[44:37.000 --> 44:37.980]  You're an idiot.
[44:37.980 --> 44:39.300]  You're a fucking dunce.
[44:42.100 --> 44:45.080]  Don't touch me.
[44:45.380 --> 44:49.100]  I bet you can't hit me, Eric.
[44:56.940 --> 44:57.760]  Six.
[45:00.980 --> 45:01.800]  Yuck.
[45:03.860 --> 45:08.300]  I'm going inside!
[45:09.400 --> 45:10.380]  Outside line, full beans.
[45:11.040 --> 45:11.820]  Nope.
[45:12.780 --> 45:16.400]  Come on.
[45:19.960 --> 45:21.380]  No, Nick!
[45:21.440 --> 45:24.000]  Just take the points, you stupid...
[45:26.120 --> 45:27.000]  Oh, that was so close, Nick.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.960]  I'm for Andrew, and I paid for it.
[45:29.040 --> 45:30.380]  That was really close.
[45:31.720 --> 45:33.620]  You could have had a par, you stupid...
[45:36.640 --> 45:37.360]  Stupid boogie.
[45:38.120 --> 45:39.720]  Oh, you don't even need the little hole, Geoff.
[45:39.760 --> 45:40.440]  You're just going over.
[45:43.580 --> 45:44.900]  I'll do it over style.
[45:45.440 --> 45:47.560]  Oh, he's one behind. He's doing it again!
[45:49.180 --> 45:49.540]  Narrowing!
[45:51.220 --> 45:52.540]  Press A to jump while in the water.
[45:53.120 --> 45:55.200]  Oh, not this hole.
[46:01.630 --> 46:02.070]  Whoops.
[46:07.100 --> 46:08.260]  Here we go.
[46:09.660 --> 46:14.760]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[46:15.660 --> 46:17.740]  We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.
[46:18.300 --> 46:19.460]  Everyone's fine, everything's fine.
[46:24.180 --> 46:25.980]  Well, I mean, at some point, am I going to do...
[46:25.980 --> 46:26.160]  Fuck me.
[46:26.800 --> 46:27.580]  Encounter, I will kill.
[46:28.220 --> 46:30.120]  No, no, no, Gavin, no.
[46:30.120 --> 46:30.400]  No.
[46:30.800 --> 46:33.140]  No, you go land up there, Gavin.
[46:33.320 --> 46:34.460]  Go land on the land.
[46:36.100 --> 46:38.380]  Me and Andrew are hanging out in the hole together because we're friends.
[46:40.420 --> 46:42.440]  How do you get to the...
[46:42.440 --> 46:43.520]  Oh, piss!
[46:44.160 --> 46:45.140]  Where's the hole?
[46:45.960 --> 46:46.520]  It's over there.
[46:48.080 --> 46:48.480]  Idiot.
[46:50.520 --> 46:51.300]  Between the two trees.
[46:55.240 --> 46:55.940]  You see it?
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.540]  Oh, for God's sake.
[47:00.540 --> 47:01.920]  There you go.
[47:02.200 --> 47:03.340]  Shouldn't have said anything.
[47:05.180 --> 47:06.440]  I'm stressing out.
[47:06.840 --> 47:07.780]  This is bad for Geoff.
[47:10.320 --> 47:11.100]  Yeah, I'm Geoff.
[47:13.360 --> 47:15.500]  He's just looking for all the clues.
[47:16.140 --> 47:18.120]  He's making sure he leaves no clues behind.
[47:19.100 --> 47:20.200]  He's got a mystery to solve.
[47:20.300 --> 47:21.180]  Nice job, Geoff.
[47:26.800 --> 47:27.840]  That sucks.
[47:27.840 --> 47:28.300]  That sucks.
[47:31.360 --> 47:32.720]  Oh, boy.
[47:33.700 --> 47:35.580]  I'm within eight striking distance.
[47:36.260 --> 47:38.140]  I was too until that round.
[47:38.560 --> 47:39.540]  Strike this.
[47:41.180 --> 47:42.920]  How do I do this?
[47:42.940 --> 47:45.880]  I was right there, son.
[47:46.940 --> 47:48.180]  Do I take the risk?
[47:54.410 --> 47:55.070]  So close.
[47:57.310 --> 47:58.230]  Oh, wow.
[47:58.230 --> 47:58.970]  Who hit me?
[48:00.730 --> 48:01.990]  Why'd you do that on purpose?
[48:02.270 --> 48:03.150]  Wasn't on purpose.
[48:03.390 --> 48:04.450]  That's not what I'm hearing.
[48:07.910 --> 48:09.930]  Didn't help pull Geoff out any, that's for sure.
[48:13.870 --> 48:14.730]  There we go.
[48:15.590 --> 48:16.050]  No!
[48:17.830 --> 48:20.310]  How many fucking beans do I have?
[48:22.050 --> 48:22.970]  Oh, that's not enough.
[48:23.090 --> 48:23.910]  That's bad.
[48:27.210 --> 48:28.330]  You know what? It worked out.
[48:28.330 --> 48:28.730]  That was fine.
[48:30.950 --> 48:31.730]  Where's Gavin?
[48:32.470 --> 48:33.570]  Come on, get up there.
[48:34.450 --> 48:39.130]  Yeah, Geoff!
[48:40.490 --> 48:41.490]  Oh, come on!
[48:42.830 --> 48:43.190]  There it is.
[48:43.370 --> 48:43.630]  Now!
[48:52.140 --> 48:53.300]  There it is.
[48:56.020 --> 48:57.640]  Maybe stop saying that.
[48:59.660 --> 49:00.760]  No, but there it is.
[49:02.260 --> 49:02.880]  Right there.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.120]  There it is.
[49:04.400 --> 49:04.820]  No!
[49:09.480 --> 49:10.260]  30 seconds.
[49:11.360 --> 49:12.740]  You're really dialing it in, though.
[49:12.760 --> 49:13.560]  There it is.
[49:14.900 --> 49:16.340]  It's in the hole, baby.
[49:17.300 --> 49:18.440]  Maybe stop saying it.
[49:18.500 --> 49:19.740]  Yeah, right, Nick. There it is.
[49:20.400 --> 49:22.120]  I took you three additional tries.
[49:26.240 --> 49:27.900]  Par four, three-stroke lead.
[49:27.900 --> 49:30.960]  Well, everybody didn't finish the last time, so...
[49:30.960 --> 49:31.900]  What's gonna happen here?
[49:36.980 --> 49:37.760]  Oh, wow.
[49:38.200 --> 49:39.900]  Dude, this is crazy.
[49:40.220 --> 49:41.660]  I've removed myself from the running.
[49:42.500 --> 49:44.780]  I'm with Geoff and...
[49:44.780 --> 49:45.440]  Oh, it's just Geoff.
[49:45.700 --> 49:47.440]  I'm with Andrew Panton.
[49:48.920 --> 49:49.960]  I don't like that.
[49:50.140 --> 49:50.660]  I fell to my death.
[49:53.260 --> 49:54.160]  Oh, no.
[49:55.200 --> 49:56.580]  Oh, hell yeah.
[49:58.540 --> 49:59.080]  Beans!
[50:01.900 --> 50:03.340]  Oh, what the fuck?
[50:03.480 --> 50:03.760]  Uh-oh.
[50:04.140 --> 50:06.160]  I made it all the way to the last ball.
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.620]  Ah, tusk pop.
[50:09.920 --> 50:11.840]  Derek, you useless shit!
[50:13.640 --> 50:15.400]  I'm having fun with my friends.
[50:15.760 --> 50:17.240]  You're in the way now, too!
[50:17.460 --> 50:19.300]  You double-dip fucked me.
[50:19.520 --> 50:19.720]  Hit him.
[50:20.120 --> 50:20.860]  That was easy.
[50:22.720 --> 50:24.180]  What are you crying about?
[50:24.960 --> 50:25.600]  This is simple.
[50:26.680 --> 50:28.540]  Nick, you're off to the side.
[50:28.540 --> 50:28.980]  What are you doing?
[50:29.800 --> 50:30.440]  Go, Nick, go.
[50:30.540 --> 50:31.340]  Ready? Now.
[50:32.180 --> 50:32.580]  Fuck!
[50:34.700 --> 50:35.100]  Yeah!
[50:37.300 --> 50:37.600]  No!
[50:40.380 --> 50:41.180]  Is that a win?
[50:44.340 --> 50:45.200]  Oh, Geoff.
[50:46.760 --> 50:47.160]  Geoff.
[50:48.800 --> 50:49.960]  Oh, you're between two.
[50:53.000 --> 50:53.940]  All right, Geoff, this is it.
[50:54.020 --> 50:54.540]  There you go.
[50:54.540 --> 50:56.320]  Nicely done.
[50:56.900 --> 50:57.700]  Great shot.
[50:59.680 --> 51:00.640]  Way to go, boys.
[51:01.140 --> 51:01.660]  We did it!
[51:01.880 --> 51:03.940]  GG, everybody.
[51:04.420 --> 51:05.480]  There's only 31 strokes off.
[51:05.940 --> 51:07.760]  Guys, thanks for watching.
