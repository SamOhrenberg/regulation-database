[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Traders last night, wow.
[00:01.860 --> 00:03.880]  Holy moly, yeah, that was a good episode.
[00:04.300 --> 00:05.880]  Kind of went how you expected it to go, but...
[00:08.360 --> 00:12.640]  I think Tom Sandoval might be one of the dumber people on television.
[00:13.800 --> 00:14.400]  Oh, easily.
[00:15.060 --> 00:16.300]  Why would he do? Oh, never mind.
[00:16.620 --> 00:18.560]  Hey guys, welcome to the stream!
[00:18.700 --> 00:20.500]  It's Friday, it's our Twitch stream.
[00:20.600 --> 00:21.360]  You know what that means.
[00:21.620 --> 00:26.940]  We're back for another hour of gameplay live at twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod.
[00:26.940 --> 00:33.160]  And this week, we thought it would be funny for Nick to do his All You Need Is Help bit again.
[00:33.520 --> 00:37.120]  So we want to show you what it's like.
[00:37.180 --> 00:40.700]  This is Nick, Gavin, Geoff, and Andrew playing All You Need Is Help.
[00:41.580 --> 00:44.140]  Nick has assured us that he's not doing a bit.
[00:44.840 --> 00:46.160]  And we're going to see how this goes.
[00:46.480 --> 00:47.140]  Nick, how are you feeling?
[00:47.300 --> 00:47.720]  It's definitely a bit.
[00:51.740 --> 00:52.980]  Shutting beginner Gavin free!
[00:53.480 --> 00:54.580]  What the heck?
[00:55.080 --> 00:57.220]  Okay, easily pig Nick.
[00:57.360 --> 00:59.300]  Oh, wait, maybe we don't need the name burn.
[00:59.500 --> 01:00.760]  If not, I don't think so.
[01:00.860 --> 01:01.940]  I mean, probably not.
[01:02.060 --> 01:03.080]  But you've played this before.
[01:03.280 --> 01:03.520]  Not me.
[01:03.580 --> 01:04.100]  So I don't know.
[01:04.260 --> 01:05.720]  You worked so hard on the name burn.
[01:05.800 --> 01:06.400]  You were stressing out.
[01:06.700 --> 01:07.920]  I think it's a great name, man.
[01:08.300 --> 01:11.160]  Yeah, I mean, they're already on there the whole time.
[01:11.360 --> 01:12.400]  Thank you so much, everybody.
[01:12.620 --> 01:14.080]  I mean, I could just get rid of it.
[01:14.780 --> 01:15.000]  Why?
[01:15.580 --> 01:16.720]  Yeah, why would you do that?
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.080]  Okay, a three minute poll is open to the people online watching live with us.
[01:22.120 --> 01:23.180]  Is Nick doing a bit?
[01:23.180 --> 01:24.240]  Let us know.
[01:24.340 --> 01:24.960]  Yes or no.
[01:25.180 --> 01:26.020]  If Nick is doing a bit.
[01:26.100 --> 01:26.540]  We're gonna melt it.
[01:26.720 --> 01:27.700]  We're melting.
[01:28.560 --> 01:29.900]  It's a hot box.
[01:32.040 --> 01:32.920]  Lead the way.
[01:34.000 --> 01:34.860]  So what is...
[01:35.820 --> 01:37.280]  Let me attach it over here.
[01:37.960 --> 01:38.380]  Here we go.
[01:38.960 --> 01:39.420]  Why aren't...
[01:40.480 --> 01:40.860]  Okay.
[01:42.780 --> 01:43.900]  Okay, here we go.
[01:46.100 --> 01:47.000]  I need to...
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.180]  Move, move, move, move, move, Nick.
[01:48.400 --> 01:48.560]  Move.
[01:48.800 --> 01:50.400]  I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.
[01:50.760 --> 01:50.940]  Sorry.
[01:50.940 --> 01:51.040]  Sorry.
[01:52.420 --> 01:53.060]  Okay, I'm going in.
[01:53.420 --> 01:53.860]  Going in.
[01:54.360 --> 01:55.760]  You should get that coin while you're up there.
[01:55.820 --> 01:56.580]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[01:57.300 --> 01:57.580]  All right.
[01:58.060 --> 01:59.120]  Geoff, what the god damn are you?
[01:59.140 --> 01:59.860]  How are you gonna get in there?
[02:00.400 --> 02:00.880]  I'm not.
[02:01.140 --> 02:01.900]  I thought I'd try.
[02:02.460 --> 02:03.200]  No, it's not doable.
[02:04.320 --> 02:04.940]  All right, I'm gonna leave this.
[02:05.840 --> 02:06.120]  Somebody...
[02:06.120 --> 02:06.620]  Okay.
[02:06.760 --> 02:09.280]  Why don't you go melt that other piece of snow and get that coin, Gavin?
[02:10.080 --> 02:11.860]  Well, okay, let's do it.
[02:11.900 --> 02:14.740]  Nick, can you grab the block right there?
[02:15.420 --> 02:18.580]  And then could you put it in the hole so I can grab it on this side?
[02:21.020 --> 02:21.620]  Yeah, hold on.
[02:22.320 --> 02:23.280]  Got to put it back down.
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.540]  Or Gavin, could you...
[02:24.540 --> 02:24.940]  I'm...
[02:24.940 --> 02:25.400]  Hold on.
[02:25.460 --> 02:26.420]  Why didn't you put the gate first?
[02:26.980 --> 02:27.460]  Well, because...
[02:27.460 --> 02:27.660]  There you go.
[02:27.740 --> 02:28.620]  This is how we do it.
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.000]  You're not doing it the right...
[02:30.000 --> 02:30.540]  No, we...
[02:31.080 --> 02:32.500]  Okay, we need to...
[02:33.560 --> 02:34.400]  This is a trap.
[02:34.680 --> 02:36.340]  Nick, I need you to move that block out of the way, please.
[02:36.480 --> 02:37.660]  I'll do it, because I'm one block.
[02:37.660 --> 02:38.520]  Okay, Gavin, you get it.
[02:38.520 --> 02:39.220]  Yeah, he's one block.
[02:39.260 --> 02:40.200]  It'll be easier for him to do it.
[02:40.340 --> 02:40.680]  Good luck.
[02:40.880 --> 02:43.180]  I just need you to be really committed to staying over there.
[02:43.600 --> 02:45.060]  Hey, Geoff, you're doing great.
[02:45.720 --> 02:46.400]  All right, now put it down.
[02:46.420 --> 02:47.000]  Thank you, Gavin.
[02:47.020 --> 02:47.600]  And now...
[02:49.500 --> 02:50.320]  We're gonna need that.
[02:50.320 --> 02:51.520]  There's no way we don't need it.
[02:51.720 --> 02:52.640]  You want to do the...
[02:55.220 --> 02:56.080]  Do the other one now?
[02:56.080 --> 02:56.760]  You still didn't take the thing to melt the snow.
[02:56.760 --> 02:58.520]  I don't know why you didn't take this fucking block.
[02:58.520 --> 03:00.660]  Why didn't you take the block to melt the snow?
[03:01.460 --> 03:01.780]  There!
[03:02.180 --> 03:04.160]  Yeah, we didn't need to put that on the button.
[03:04.160 --> 03:05.880]  He also didn't need to leave it!
[03:06.060 --> 03:06.960]  Good, Geoff, we're stuck.
[03:07.080 --> 03:08.920]  I was just gonna put it in the gate so you bugs could get through.
[03:08.920 --> 03:09.940]  We can't go anywhere, man.
[03:09.940 --> 03:11.580]  We can't really do anything once we get through.
[03:11.640 --> 03:12.620]  Oh, we do need them.
[03:12.660 --> 03:13.000]  I'm sorry.
[03:13.120 --> 03:16.520]  I thought it was a situation where you needed to hold it down.
[03:16.740 --> 03:17.700]  Are you doing a bit?
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.720]  No, I'm just saying it's a way so much for the gifted subs, guys.
[03:22.820 --> 03:24.280]  Today is Andrew's bit.
[03:24.840 --> 03:25.700]  Yeah, this is Andrew's bit.
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.680]  We were playing a different game where there are weighted plates and that's...
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.660]  Okay, what are you guys doing?
[03:30.780 --> 03:32.260]  Christ, you're sorest with the gifted.
[03:32.440 --> 03:33.160]  This has been great.
[03:33.280 --> 03:34.720]  This is a great stream so far.
[03:35.200 --> 03:35.900]  When you're not...
[03:35.900 --> 03:38.100]  When you're only watching this and not playing, it's really different.
[03:38.360 --> 03:38.740]  Excuse me?
[03:38.820 --> 03:39.820]  Why'd you do that to me?
[03:39.840 --> 03:40.600]  Oh my god!
[03:40.780 --> 03:42.240]  Why'd you do that to me?
[03:42.560 --> 03:42.940]  Thank you.
[03:43.140 --> 03:43.400]  Andrew.
[03:43.780 --> 03:45.920]  Why did you do that, you little fucker?
[03:46.000 --> 03:46.380]  Why?
[03:46.380 --> 03:47.840]  I needed to get there.
[03:47.860 --> 03:48.620]  I'm sorry, man.
[03:51.520 --> 03:52.660]  There you go.
[03:52.700 --> 03:53.980]  Just rub against me.
[03:54.220 --> 03:54.940]  Are you doing a bit?
[03:55.720 --> 03:57.140]  No, just push against me.
[03:57.240 --> 03:57.740]  It'll be fine.
[03:58.140 --> 03:59.440]  I need you to like me now.
[03:59.520 --> 04:00.400]  It's so hard to...
[04:00.400 --> 04:00.820]  Get up!
[04:01.080 --> 04:01.560]  Stand up!
[04:01.840 --> 04:03.520]  Stand the fuck back up and help!
[04:03.920 --> 04:04.840]  You've done this.
[04:04.940 --> 04:05.840]  You've made this mess.
[04:05.920 --> 04:06.260]  We're done.
[04:06.320 --> 04:06.800]  You know what?
[04:06.960 --> 04:07.380]  You know what?
[04:07.420 --> 04:08.500]  We're doing this level again.
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.300]  We're gonna do this...
[04:11.300 --> 04:12.440]  Oh, there you go.
[04:12.560 --> 04:13.680]  Suddenly, he can move.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.140]  Oh, and suddenly...
[04:15.140 --> 04:16.580]  Pop right in, man.
[04:16.880 --> 04:23.100]  Geoff, I think what happened is Andrew heard me and how upset I was.
[04:23.140 --> 04:23.940]  Thank you!
[04:23.960 --> 04:26.780]  Then he decided to take attention away from my stupidity.
[04:27.440 --> 04:28.240]  You're set.
[04:28.740 --> 04:31.500]  The poll is closed.
[04:31.660 --> 04:32.480]  Is Nick doing a bit?
[04:32.600 --> 04:33.900]  66% say yes.
[04:34.060 --> 04:35.600]  So two-thirds believe that Nick is doing a bit.
[04:35.640 --> 04:36.280]  Everybody hit buttons!
[04:37.120 --> 04:37.960]  That's 60...
[04:37.960 --> 04:39.220]  Man, suckers.
[04:40.900 --> 04:41.780]  Geoff's the MVP!
[04:42.960 --> 04:43.960]  Geoff, are you the MVP?
[04:47.380 --> 04:49.000]  I thought he did really good.
[04:49.520 --> 04:52.680]  I have the most valuable patience.
[04:52.860 --> 04:53.390]  That's for sure.
[04:54.180 --> 04:54.950]  That's for sure.
[04:56.440 --> 04:57.360]  Let's sit back down.
[04:57.600 --> 04:58.340]  What color am I?
[04:58.440 --> 04:58.840]  Oh, right.
[05:00.640 --> 05:02.820]  That's not a color, Nick.
[05:03.180 --> 05:04.200]  Changing my vote to yes.
[05:04.580 --> 05:05.880]  Coming from the name button guy.
[05:08.000 --> 05:08.980]  You know what?
[05:09.040 --> 05:09.600]  You got me there.
[05:11.060 --> 05:11.940]  What was that one?
[05:14.580 --> 05:17.980]  Oh, somebody said they're lower in their slider because this feels so forced.
[05:18.100 --> 05:19.220]  I wish this was forced.
[05:22.420 --> 05:22.820]  Okay.
[05:24.240 --> 05:25.220]  Okay, annoying monster.
[05:25.220 --> 05:25.560]  What are we doing?
[05:25.840 --> 05:26.700]  What are our shapes?
[05:27.840 --> 05:28.580]  Your whole line.
[05:28.860 --> 05:30.280]  Skinny Wah, thank you very much.
[05:31.940 --> 05:33.140]  I got big arms.
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.460]  Look at my big arms.
[05:34.860 --> 05:36.160]  Are you drinking coffee right now, Eric?
[05:36.360 --> 05:37.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:37.520 --> 05:38.500]  Ah, that sounds awesome.
[05:38.800 --> 05:39.940]  It's a great cup of coffee.
[05:40.560 --> 05:41.740]  You're a real sipper, aren't you?
[05:41.940 --> 05:42.640]  I am.
[05:43.100 --> 05:44.460]  Let's just see what these buttons do.
[05:44.460 --> 05:45.700]  What, are you a coffee gulper?
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.820]  He drinks small little coffees, so definitely.
[05:51.040 --> 05:52.740]  I guess I'm a sipper and a slipper.
[05:55.040 --> 05:56.040]  Ready to blow?
[05:57.400 --> 05:58.860]  Do I need to get down on that button?
[05:59.620 --> 06:01.500]  I think you might need to.
[06:01.760 --> 06:02.120]  Not there.
[06:04.080 --> 06:05.220]  Oh, it shoots.
[06:06.080 --> 06:07.060]  What? Oh, I'm sorry.
[06:07.120 --> 06:07.680]  Let me get out of the way.
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.260]  What would I need to shoot, though?
[06:11.540 --> 06:12.840]  The bridge up there, maybe?
[06:14.260 --> 06:14.500]  Yeah, maybe.
[06:14.520 --> 06:17.520]  I mean, not bridge. I'm the fence.
[06:18.560 --> 06:22.260]  How do you, like, rotate? Do you have to run into stuff to rotate?
[06:22.680 --> 06:22.880]  Yeah.
[06:25.760 --> 06:26.780]  Oh, that's difficult.
[06:27.180 --> 06:28.720]  If you could just turn, this game would be great.
[06:28.720 --> 06:29.600]  It is for Nick.
[06:30.240 --> 06:31.860]  There we go. Gavin got it.
[06:32.020 --> 06:32.660]  Gavin got it.
[06:32.880 --> 06:34.680]  Now we just need Geoff to get it.
[06:34.960 --> 06:36.840]  Yeah. Okay, so I just gotta turn around.
[06:37.440 --> 06:38.000]  Yeah, there you go.
[06:39.520 --> 06:40.240]  It's probably...
[06:40.240 --> 06:41.840]  The de-wangle myself.
[06:48.620 --> 06:50.480]  Tyler Oaks, thank you so much.
[06:50.560 --> 06:51.540]  I can't go forward.
[06:52.320 --> 06:53.180]  God damn it.
[06:53.500 --> 06:54.040]  There we go.
[06:54.980 --> 06:55.860]  Is Geoff doing a bit?
[06:56.420 --> 06:57.320]  Geoff, you got this.
[07:00.560 --> 07:04.460]  There's an invisible wall at the wall that you can't go past.
[07:05.040 --> 07:06.140]  And then... okay, there we go.
[07:06.620 --> 07:07.100]  No?
[07:08.680 --> 07:09.640]  It's like...
[07:09.640 --> 07:11.140]  You're parking a car in Europe.
[07:13.120 --> 07:13.880]  I'm not parking.
[07:14.120 --> 07:15.020]  I want to die.
[07:15.080 --> 07:17.640]  I want to walk off the edge and get reset and it won't let me.
[07:17.740 --> 07:18.380]  Turn a little bit.
[07:19.520 --> 07:22.440]  Resetting would just tilt you like three degrees back the other way.
[07:22.560 --> 07:22.680]  Yeah.
[07:22.720 --> 07:25.620]  I know and I could go forward those three degrees if I could do that.
[07:26.300 --> 07:26.840]  I can't get forward.
[07:26.840 --> 07:27.580]  Where are you trying to go?
[07:27.940 --> 07:30.000]  I'm trying to go forward so that I can spin.
[07:30.100 --> 07:30.880]  He's gotta hit the button.
[07:35.180 --> 07:35.800]  There we go.
[07:36.220 --> 07:40.660]  T-Sensha, 20 gifted subs watching Geoff park a car in Europe.
[07:40.760 --> 07:42.260]  Thank you so much, T-Sensha.
[07:42.260 --> 07:43.900]  I love you, 52.
[07:44.140 --> 07:45.140]  Oh my god.
[07:45.660 --> 07:48.380]  How many subs can we get before Geoff turns to the side?
[07:48.740 --> 07:49.660]  How did you spin?
[07:50.280 --> 07:54.800]  I just rubbed myself on one of those two blocks and just smeared myself around.
[07:54.820 --> 07:57.060]  You got two minutes, 45 seconds left.
[07:57.900 --> 07:58.600]  Plenty of time.
[07:59.080 --> 08:00.000]  Will he do it?
[08:00.220 --> 08:01.260]  Smear yourself around.
[08:01.960 --> 08:03.680]  No, no, don't go back on the big platform.
[08:03.800 --> 08:04.820]  Just do it from the little path.
[08:04.960 --> 08:05.520]  There you go.
[08:05.820 --> 08:06.600]  Yeah, just keep doing that.
[08:06.600 --> 08:07.840]  And now back it up.
[08:08.560 --> 08:08.940]  No, no, no.
[08:09.100 --> 08:09.540]  Back it up.
[08:09.560 --> 08:10.240]  Now go all the way left.
[08:10.340 --> 08:11.300]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[08:13.060 --> 08:14.740]  No, not on that platform, on the path.
[08:15.940 --> 08:16.380]  All right.
[08:16.460 --> 08:17.200]  New pole open.
[08:17.400 --> 08:18.440]  Is Geoff doing a bit?
[08:18.700 --> 08:19.240]  Forward to the right.
[08:19.340 --> 08:19.960]  Yeah, great.
[08:20.140 --> 08:20.660]  Back it up.
[08:20.860 --> 08:22.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:23.260 --> 08:24.900]  Norris Rider, thank you for the gifted.
[08:25.080 --> 08:26.560]  Guys, so many subs coming in.
[08:26.800 --> 08:27.360]  Way to go, man.
[08:27.800 --> 08:28.120]  Done.
[08:28.300 --> 08:28.840]  Oh, sweet.
[08:28.940 --> 08:30.400]  Now you have to turn back the other way.
[08:30.500 --> 08:30.860]  Yeah, we do.
[08:31.500 --> 08:32.400]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:32.440 --> 08:33.440]  You have to get those coins, no?
[08:34.240 --> 08:35.080]  Oh yeah, get the coins.
[08:35.240 --> 08:35.820]  How do we get them?
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.540]  Walk into them?
[08:38.660 --> 08:38.980]  Oh, okay.
[08:39.080 --> 08:39.600]  Yeah, sweet.
[08:43.180 --> 08:44.540]  Asylum pilot and gifted.
[08:44.700 --> 08:45.400]  This is crazy.
[08:46.760 --> 08:48.840]  Can't these guys come down here and help you turn?
[08:48.940 --> 08:49.860]  Oh no, they won't fit.
[08:52.560 --> 08:54.620]  Well, I don't think we can turn now.
[08:56.120 --> 08:56.960]  I don't know why.
[08:57.140 --> 08:58.140]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, Geoff.
[08:58.280 --> 09:01.840]  Geoff, what if you go to the, like, go all the way left at the top?
[09:02.260 --> 09:03.020]  Oh no, I'm sorry.
[09:03.060 --> 09:03.700]  That's the wrong height.
[09:03.800 --> 09:04.280]  I apologize.
[09:05.140 --> 09:06.140]  I was, uh.
[09:08.040 --> 09:08.400]  Yeah.
[09:09.800 --> 09:11.340]  Hey, Andrew, if you shoot them.
[09:11.340 --> 09:12.340]  Does it turn them?
[09:12.560 --> 09:12.800]  Oh, yeah.
[09:12.940 --> 09:13.700]  It's a good question.
[09:13.700 --> 09:17.460]  Wait, you guys have, like, a whole mechanic over there and we're busy with our thumbs up.
[09:17.460 --> 09:18.800]  Well, Andrew has a mechanic.
[09:18.980 --> 09:20.240]  I'm just twisting the mechanic.
[09:20.260 --> 09:21.680]  Well, there's a whole gate thing.
[09:22.340 --> 09:22.480]  Ow.
[09:22.660 --> 09:22.860]  Yeah.
[09:22.980 --> 09:23.520]  Oh, okay.
[09:23.580 --> 09:25.020]  Let me, uh, let me open this thing.
[09:26.260 --> 09:26.780]  There you go.
[09:26.880 --> 09:27.000]  Ready?
[09:27.500 --> 09:28.060]  Give it a shot.
[09:28.260 --> 09:28.580]  All right.
[09:30.640 --> 09:32.180]  But that's not gonna turn him, is it?
[09:32.260 --> 09:32.880]  Oh, it worked.
[09:33.320 --> 09:33.400]  Okay.
[09:33.760 --> 09:37.080]  So you could have been doing that always.
[09:37.580 --> 09:37.740]  Yeah.
[09:37.960 --> 09:40.160]  You just thought I was there for a long, but we didn't need it.
[09:41.340 --> 09:42.300]  Here, hit me again.
[09:42.540 --> 09:43.400]  Yeah, he needs more health.
[09:44.360 --> 09:46.680]  We had to jam break level to turn around the first time.
[09:46.980 --> 09:47.120]  Yep.
[09:47.940 --> 09:49.120]  Now I don't feel as bad.
[09:49.660 --> 09:51.600]  I was clearly trying to do something super hard.
[09:52.320 --> 09:52.820]  Thank you.
[09:52.960 --> 09:53.360]  There you go.
[09:53.840 --> 09:55.000]  All right, let's get the other one.
[09:57.860 --> 09:58.220]  Okay.
[09:59.040 --> 10:00.440]  Wait, you guys have a mechanic?
[10:00.740 --> 10:01.000]  Yeah.
[10:02.120 --> 10:02.480]  Great.
[10:03.100 --> 10:05.600]  I did hear you say that you had the thing to shoot.
[10:05.680 --> 10:07.860]  I just assumed you'd already used it and done with it.
[10:07.860 --> 10:12.320]  I thought you had to open the gate above for me to go find somewhere to use it.
[10:12.500 --> 10:13.660]  Okay, we got to spin this.
[10:14.100 --> 10:14.540]  Well, you can.
[10:14.640 --> 10:16.860]  You can go and shoot me through the top bit if you want.
[10:17.020 --> 10:17.800]  Just do something.
[10:19.240 --> 10:19.560]  Dancing.
[10:25.080 --> 10:26.080]  What's Geoff doing in here?
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.700]  Geoff casually walking in here.
[10:27.740 --> 10:29.560]  What is Geoff doing in here?
[10:30.140 --> 10:31.180]  He has to be in his bag.
[10:31.300 --> 10:32.300]  I'm not allowed to be in here.
[10:32.380 --> 10:33.360]  This is where the level ends.
[10:33.920 --> 10:34.340]  I see.
[10:34.460 --> 10:35.840]  How the hell am I gonna get out of here, Geoff?
[10:35.840 --> 10:36.040]  There you go.
[10:36.060 --> 10:36.760]  Could you go to the other side?
[10:37.320 --> 10:37.840]  Oh, no.
[10:37.920 --> 10:38.900]  Am I in your way, Nick?
[10:39.300 --> 10:41.780]  Somehow did I stop you from going where you need to go?
[10:42.060 --> 10:43.760]  Oh, I would hate to do that.
[10:43.780 --> 10:44.620]  Oh, no.
[10:44.620 --> 10:45.800]  Geoff, Geoff, I'm not Andrew.
[10:46.080 --> 10:46.600]  I know.
[10:47.660 --> 10:48.080]  One sec.
[10:48.640 --> 10:49.740]  Andrew, today would be wicked.
[10:50.360 --> 10:52.540]  Yeah, I'm Justin, I'm Justin, I'm Justin.
[10:52.680 --> 10:52.840]  Nope.
[10:52.840 --> 10:53.100]  What are you?
[11:00.780 --> 11:01.680]  Okay, now what?
[11:02.800 --> 11:03.360]  Wrong way.
[11:04.320 --> 11:05.480]  He's got it, he's got it, he's got it.
[11:05.500 --> 11:06.120]  Just give him a second.
[11:06.360 --> 11:06.760]  He's got it.
[11:06.800 --> 11:07.200]  There he is.
[11:07.480 --> 11:09.060]  Absolutely wild way to aim that.
[11:09.460 --> 11:09.840]  There we go.
[11:11.400 --> 11:11.800]  Okay.
[11:12.100 --> 11:12.400]  There you go.
[11:12.400 --> 11:12.680]  Perfect.
[11:13.280 --> 11:14.920]  Too far, I think.
[11:14.960 --> 11:15.620]  Do you want another shot?
[11:16.240 --> 11:16.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:17.060 --> 11:17.540]  Hit me again.
[11:17.920 --> 11:18.080]  Okay.
[11:18.120 --> 11:18.500]  Fire.
[11:19.200 --> 11:19.540]  Thank you.
[11:19.540 --> 11:19.780]  Got it.
[11:20.740 --> 11:21.140]  Nice.
[11:21.300 --> 11:21.780]  Love that.
[11:23.100 --> 11:24.100]  Now come on in.
[11:25.760 --> 11:27.140]  So we're gonna need that guy.
[11:27.440 --> 11:27.640]  What?
[11:27.700 --> 11:27.820]  Yep.
[11:28.280 --> 11:28.740]  Putting him down.
[11:30.800 --> 11:31.500]  What happened?
[11:31.620 --> 11:32.600]  You got, you got bumped around.
[11:33.120 --> 11:34.580]  Yeah, I got, I got straight up.
[11:35.240 --> 11:35.920]  There we go.
[11:37.880 --> 11:40.060]  I guess I can twat this fence to come around.
[11:41.020 --> 11:41.980]  Fence twat.
[11:43.000 --> 11:43.840]  Fence twat.
[11:43.860 --> 11:46.100]  I'll go ahead and twat myself this way.
[11:46.140 --> 11:46.480]  There we go.
[11:48.920 --> 11:49.440]  Gavin.
[11:51.980 --> 11:52.380]  Gavin.
[11:52.500 --> 11:53.380]  Wait, why would you?
[11:55.680 --> 11:56.980]  What a dick.
[11:57.480 --> 12:01.700]  I work, I started a company with some of the worst people.
[12:02.280 --> 12:05.220]  Yeah, but here's your chance to get into a different one, right?
[12:06.640 --> 12:11.520]  No, I already did that company with those, with those other bad people.
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.580]  I was trying to escape.
[12:13.020 --> 12:15.880]  I was like out of the shit pan into the shit fryer.
[12:20.220 --> 12:21.720]  Definitely MVP once again.
[12:22.260 --> 12:27.400]  Yeah, because I'm the only one who's not trolling everybody else on the fucking floor, Gavin.
[12:27.420 --> 12:28.420]  No, I didn't do anything.
[12:29.880 --> 12:30.740]  My environment is a mild troll.
[12:30.760 --> 12:31.620]  You're ineptitude does everything, Nick.
[12:32.920 --> 12:35.500]  I got enough coins to do the gacha machines.
[12:35.600 --> 12:36.080]  Let's do that.
[12:36.280 --> 12:37.420]  How do we get a new level again?
[12:37.500 --> 12:38.800]  What are we, what are we trying to collect?
[12:39.640 --> 12:41.480]  We unlocked the ice stuff last time, didn't we?
[12:41.740 --> 12:44.300]  Yeah, I voted for, that was a new version as well.
[12:45.040 --> 12:46.540]  You can go to the map and pick.
[12:47.200 --> 12:48.040]  Oh, I got a guitar.
[12:48.920 --> 12:49.580]  That's fun for you.
[12:49.640 --> 12:50.040]  I got a microphone.
[12:50.600 --> 12:51.760]  Oh my god, you guys are in a little band.
[12:52.800 --> 12:54.000]  I got a new title podcast.
[12:54.100 --> 12:55.280]  I'm gonna put it on right now.
[12:56.580 --> 12:57.880]  Oh, it's the stamp card.
[13:00.040 --> 13:04.980]  Geoff, if it helps, 75% of people said that you are not doing a bit.
[13:06.620 --> 13:08.420]  Great. I don't know what that bit would be.
[13:09.420 --> 13:11.040]  Annoying? Annoyed? That's my bit.
[13:12.400 --> 13:13.840]  All right, I have a new title now.
[13:14.760 --> 13:15.300]  Hell yeah.
[13:15.480 --> 13:15.900]  I'm ready to go.
[13:16.020 --> 13:16.560]  Way to go, man.
[13:17.020 --> 13:17.980]  You're playing it with your head.
[13:18.420 --> 13:19.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[13:19.320 --> 13:21.480]  That doesn't seem like the right hand to do it, but you know, it's good.
[13:21.940 --> 13:22.860]  Let's run again, hold A.
[13:23.180 --> 13:23.800]  That's all I have.
[13:25.840 --> 13:26.680]  Hold A, yes.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.680]  All right, where are we going, boys?
[13:30.820 --> 13:31.300]  Where are we dropping?
[13:31.640 --> 13:32.620]  Oh, this is a basic one.
[13:32.940 --> 13:33.760]  This is an easy one.
[13:34.560 --> 13:35.700]  Basic easy peas.
[13:35.860 --> 13:37.280]  How do we only do the ones we haven't done?
[13:37.640 --> 13:40.940]  Go to the map and pick a specific island.
[13:42.000 --> 13:42.360]  All right.
[13:44.600 --> 13:45.500]  There you have it.
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.520]  Well, at least this should be relatively quick and painless.
[13:50.820 --> 13:51.680]  It should be very quick.
[13:52.940 --> 13:54.280]  I like famous last words.
[13:54.360 --> 13:54.660]  That's cool.
[13:54.940 --> 13:56.000]  Yeah, I also like that.
[13:56.200 --> 13:56.940]  I'm gonna get the coin.
[13:57.400 --> 13:58.180]  I'm getting the coins.
[14:00.160 --> 14:00.560]  Okay.
[14:04.760 --> 14:05.560]  All right.
[14:06.200 --> 14:06.840]  Excuse me.
[14:06.940 --> 14:07.200]  Pardon me.
[14:07.280 --> 14:07.740]  Excuse me.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.740]  So everyone has to grab like their little...
[14:12.660 --> 14:13.380]  Yeah, we need it.
[14:13.500 --> 14:15.220]  We need it to fill in the...
[14:15.220 --> 14:15.720]  Got it.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.580]  I guess the question is, where do we place them?
[14:20.600 --> 14:21.600]  Uh, where they're marked.
[14:21.680 --> 14:22.920]  Oh, just on the additional part.
[14:23.040 --> 14:23.220]  Okay.
[14:25.080 --> 14:25.920]  Oh, I see.
[14:25.920 --> 14:27.660]  How do you connect to it again?
[14:28.680 --> 14:30.520]  Spin and connect to a corner to it.
[14:33.220 --> 14:34.360]  Not your corner.
[14:34.500 --> 14:35.560]  It has to be, I think, one or the other.
[14:35.660 --> 14:36.100]  I hit the...
[14:36.100 --> 14:36.440]  Yeah, here.
[14:36.480 --> 14:37.360]  Come spin against me.
[14:45.260 --> 14:46.540]  I spun too much.
[14:46.860 --> 14:47.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[14:47.460 --> 14:48.120]  You got it right there.
[14:48.380 --> 14:48.760]  There you go.
[14:50.680 --> 14:51.380]  Second sec.
[14:51.980 --> 14:52.340]  Down!
[14:52.440 --> 14:52.700]  Connect!
[14:53.440 --> 14:53.840]  Connect!
[14:54.360 --> 14:55.380]  Why doesn't it connect?
[14:55.380 --> 14:55.700]  Connect!
[14:56.840 --> 14:57.560]  There, there.
[14:57.860 --> 14:58.100]  Connect!
[14:59.120 --> 15:00.580]  Why would you go there, Yellow?
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.080]  Uh, where would you like me to be?
[15:05.400 --> 15:06.120]  Anywhere, but...
[15:06.620 --> 15:07.560]  This isn't right.
[15:07.940 --> 15:09.240]  You're not in the right spot, Gavin.
[15:09.460 --> 15:10.560]  We got just about...
[15:10.560 --> 15:11.960]  We got about four minutes left.
[15:12.060 --> 15:12.860]  We're doing good.
[15:17.220 --> 15:18.200]  There we go.
[15:18.320 --> 15:19.060]  There you go, buddy.
[15:19.280 --> 15:19.860]  I got it.
[15:20.080 --> 15:21.100]  I got it.
[15:21.540 --> 15:22.820]  All right, let me get out of your way, Geoff.
[15:22.900 --> 15:23.080]  Go ahead.
[15:23.120 --> 15:25.360]  Just don't let anybody forget Nick's the bad one, not me.
[15:25.380 --> 15:27.360]  This isn't even the right spot, Gavin.
[15:27.380 --> 15:28.420]  What are you doing over there?
[15:28.540 --> 15:29.340]  So far today.
[15:29.340 --> 15:30.940]  I was just trying to put it on the other end of me.
[15:31.580 --> 15:32.300]  The other end of myself.
[15:32.620 --> 15:33.080]  What do you mean?
[15:34.200 --> 15:36.780]  You gotta put it on the pattern block.
[15:36.840 --> 15:37.780]  Yeah, no shit, son.
[15:38.420 --> 15:39.320]  It's not there.
[15:39.620 --> 15:40.360]  You're saying no shit.
[15:40.440 --> 15:41.040]  It's not there.
[15:41.640 --> 15:42.380]  I had it on there.
[15:42.420 --> 15:43.080]  I just move it.
[15:43.160 --> 15:43.700]  I'm moving it.
[15:45.940 --> 15:46.300]  Okay.
[15:48.880 --> 15:51.620]  I'm glad you took it on a little fucking tour around the neighborhood.
[15:52.120 --> 15:52.760]  Good job.
[15:54.700 --> 15:55.360]  Great, man.
[15:56.680 --> 15:57.040]  What?
[15:59.700 --> 16:01.360]  Fucking MLG pro up there.
[16:01.460 --> 16:02.760]  All right, there it is, boys.
[16:03.200 --> 16:03.920]  All right.
[16:06.540 --> 16:06.900]  Okay.
[16:08.340 --> 16:09.020]  Well, I got...
[16:11.120 --> 16:12.840]  Geoff or Gavin's gonna have to move for you, Andrew.
[16:13.740 --> 16:14.340]  Can I steal this gun?
[16:14.360 --> 16:15.860]  Oh, you need me to move it out of the way again?
[16:16.160 --> 16:16.900]  Little boy who meets.
[16:17.100 --> 16:17.740]  No, no, no, no.
[16:18.200 --> 16:20.300]  No, just needed you to move, but sure.
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.940]  How can he get in if...
[16:23.520 --> 16:24.020]  It could...
[16:24.020 --> 16:26.540]  If you were out of the way, he could have slid past you.
[16:26.880 --> 16:28.380]  Let me rub up against this guy.
[16:28.780 --> 16:29.440]  If this was here...
[16:30.860 --> 16:34.280]  Yes, if that was there, he could just walk in sideways.
[16:34.680 --> 16:35.040]  Oh, no.
[16:35.360 --> 16:37.560]  Oh, no.
[16:38.900 --> 16:40.280]  Theoretically, he could walk in sideways.
[16:42.660 --> 16:47.000]  Oh, dude, fucking Clyde Frogs in Mexico doesn't have a single channel in English.
[16:47.080 --> 16:48.040]  You must have got my hotel room.
[16:48.480 --> 16:48.840]  There we go.
[16:50.820 --> 16:51.660]  Look at that.
[16:52.080 --> 16:53.360]  Hey, all right, boys.
[16:53.700 --> 16:54.800]  Way to go.
[16:55.040 --> 16:56.220]  We nailed it.
[16:57.100 --> 16:58.320]  Send likes to each other.
[17:00.460 --> 17:02.840]  All right, so show me the map.
[17:04.700 --> 17:06.800]  It's the big map where we sit.
[17:07.980 --> 17:08.140]  Sure.
[17:09.620 --> 17:10.060]  Giant.
[17:10.620 --> 17:12.120]  It's in the center of the screen.
[17:13.760 --> 17:14.760]  Can't miss it.
[17:16.580 --> 17:17.660]  Oh, right there.
[17:17.820 --> 17:17.920]  Oh, yeah, the map.
[17:18.120 --> 17:18.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:18.520 --> 17:19.920]  A lot.
[17:19.940 --> 17:21.320]  I feel a lot better about.
[17:21.500 --> 17:23.780]  Yeah, I think this is this is a redemption arc for Nick.
[17:23.840 --> 17:24.740]  And I think that's pretty great.
[17:25.040 --> 17:25.900]  I'm feeling good.
[17:26.040 --> 17:28.780]  Yeah, you should be able to pick your stages.
[17:29.640 --> 17:30.200]  All right.
[17:30.200 --> 17:33.060]  I've ticked the snow, which I thought I already did.
[17:34.180 --> 17:36.660]  Everyone, everyone go tick snow.
[17:42.400 --> 17:44.240]  Then we'll only get snow levels, I assume.
[17:44.440 --> 17:46.280]  Woolly winterland is that we want.
[17:46.680 --> 17:46.940]  Yep.
[17:50.980 --> 17:52.780]  OK, OK, OK.
[17:55.100 --> 17:57.040]  You two need to green and blue.
[17:57.160 --> 17:58.640]  You need to stand up and sit.
[18:00.520 --> 18:01.400]  There you go.
[18:01.940 --> 18:02.600]  What the fuck?
[18:02.780 --> 18:02.900]  What?
[18:03.280 --> 18:03.320]  What?
[18:03.320 --> 18:04.120]  We were already sitting.
[18:04.680 --> 18:06.180]  No, you sat a long time ago.
[18:06.760 --> 18:10.380]  You don't need to be actively sitting.
[18:10.420 --> 18:12.540]  You sit once and then activates that you're ready.
[18:12.940 --> 18:14.760]  And so you sat a second time on it.
[18:14.760 --> 18:15.780]  You said, I'm not ready.
[18:15.780 --> 18:16.820]  That's ridiculous.
[18:16.820 --> 18:18.040]  That's the dumbest thing ever.
[18:18.040 --> 18:18.960]  Fuck that.
[18:19.240 --> 18:20.420]  Yeah, I'm going to figure it out.
[18:20.640 --> 18:22.240]  Oh, Nick's so big.
[18:23.080 --> 18:23.520]  Wow.
[18:26.300 --> 18:27.420]  Good lord.
[18:30.160 --> 18:31.240]  I'm nervous again.
[18:31.540 --> 18:32.800]  Thanks, Alpha Kappa.
[18:33.300 --> 18:34.380]  All right, let's get the...
[18:34.380 --> 18:35.760]  Holy shit.
[18:38.620 --> 18:39.180]  So...
[18:39.180 --> 18:41.360]  Get the coin, get the coin, get the coin.
[18:41.960 --> 18:43.120]  Get a turn here.
[18:44.540 --> 18:45.320]  What's happening?
[18:45.860 --> 18:46.580]  Nick's massive.
[18:46.840 --> 18:47.800]  Why did it all freeze?
[18:47.960 --> 18:48.500]  The game froze.
[18:49.660 --> 18:51.200]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[18:52.380 --> 18:54.340]  OK, we're good.
[18:54.460 --> 18:55.000]  What happened to the game?
[18:56.640 --> 18:56.980]  Did I get the coin?
[18:56.980 --> 18:57.760]  I'll lag you for a minute.
[18:58.180 --> 18:58.520]  Yeah, probably.
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.020]  Did I get the coin?
[18:59.120 --> 19:00.200]  Probably your internet, Gavin.
[19:01.200 --> 19:01.560]  Netcode.
[19:02.900 --> 19:04.020]  All right, I'm going to use you.
[19:04.160 --> 19:05.200]  All right, Geoff's locked in.
[19:05.600 --> 19:05.900]  OK, good.
[19:06.280 --> 19:07.660]  We need to get in you, Nick.
[19:09.140 --> 19:09.500]  OK.
[19:10.280 --> 19:10.840]  Let me in you, Nick.
[19:10.840 --> 19:12.040]  Let me turn around the other way.
[19:12.580 --> 19:13.320]  Yeah, I'm going to use you.
[19:13.860 --> 19:14.360]  OK, I'm in.
[19:15.840 --> 19:16.940]  Everybody else get in.
[19:17.080 --> 19:18.840]  I need to turn, Andrew.
[19:19.140 --> 19:19.800]  I'll wait until he spins.
[19:20.000 --> 19:20.420]  I'll push you.
[19:20.760 --> 19:22.120]  Andrew, not that guy.
[19:22.660 --> 19:22.680]  There you go.
[19:22.720 --> 19:23.080]  There you go.
[19:23.340 --> 19:24.320]  Why are you picking a bat?
[19:24.360 --> 19:24.800]  He's upside the other.
[19:25.180 --> 19:28.520]  OK, OK, OK, OK, spin you, spin you, spin you, spin you.
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.180]  I'm helping you.
[19:31.780 --> 19:32.500]  Oh, man.
[19:32.600 --> 19:33.340]  I don't know that you are.
[19:33.340 --> 19:33.820]  I'm helping you.
[19:35.260 --> 19:36.020]  There you go.
[19:36.060 --> 19:36.500]  There you go.
[19:36.520 --> 19:37.760]  There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go.
[19:38.080 --> 19:39.740]  Excellent, excellent, excellent.
[19:39.960 --> 19:41.160]  Everybody hop in, Nick.
[19:41.800 --> 19:43.020]  You don't need to until I'm down.
[19:43.020 --> 19:44.040]  Get your dick in here, Geoff.
[19:44.080 --> 19:45.020]  Yeah, I'm doing it.
[19:45.020 --> 19:46.880]  Why do you have to keep spinning?
[19:47.100 --> 19:47.800]  What's the problem?
[19:48.100 --> 19:49.260]  Stop spinning, Andrew!
[19:49.880 --> 19:51.360]  I'm pushing him, I'm pushing him.
[19:51.460 --> 19:52.960]  Network latency and all that.
[19:53.100 --> 19:54.140]  Oh, my God.
[19:54.180 --> 19:54.640]  There we go.
[19:55.120 --> 19:55.640]  You're set.
[19:56.680 --> 19:56.980]  Right.
[19:57.560 --> 19:57.760]  Sit.
[19:57.920 --> 19:58.720]  Sit for a minute.
[19:58.920 --> 19:59.420]  Sit for a second.
[20:00.020 --> 20:00.640]  There you go.
[20:01.580 --> 20:01.900]  Centered.
[20:02.160 --> 20:02.560]  Beautiful.
[20:02.780 --> 20:04.040]  But why are you in there yet?
[20:04.360 --> 20:06.300]  Because I got to be in here to be in my shape.
[20:06.720 --> 20:08.080]  You can get in here eventually.
[20:09.140 --> 20:10.660]  OK, OK, OK, Jesus Christ.
[20:10.840 --> 20:11.660]  Well, don't get out now.
[20:11.700 --> 20:12.420]  You're already in.
[20:12.560 --> 20:13.820]  He's there now.
[20:14.000 --> 20:14.320]  Yeah.
[20:15.680 --> 20:18.080]  But for real, get out, because everybody else has to go in there.
[20:18.820 --> 20:20.340]  Like, you don't want to be there.
[20:20.560 --> 20:22.320]  That's not going to be where Andrew wants.
[20:22.360 --> 20:23.740]  That's probably where Geoff wants to go.
[20:24.040 --> 20:24.580]  That's not right.
[20:26.420 --> 20:28.460]  Geoff, just imagine if you were in there that early.
[20:28.740 --> 20:29.700]  Everyone would be giving you hell, dude.
[20:29.720 --> 20:31.880]  Excuse me, husky detective trying to get by.
[20:32.060 --> 20:32.480]  Excuse me.
[20:32.680 --> 20:32.940]  Pardon me.
[20:33.660 --> 20:34.220]  Pardon me.
[20:35.400 --> 20:35.560]  OK.
[20:36.300 --> 20:37.580]  Geoff, I think you got to go in first.
[20:39.780 --> 20:42.700]  I've surveyed the scene as the detective and I've made the determination.
[20:42.700 --> 20:46.200]  That you probably got to go in there first.
[20:47.920 --> 20:49.040]  Well, how am I going to?
[20:49.120 --> 20:51.160]  OK, wait, I can go forward.
[20:51.500 --> 20:52.260]  Oh, that's good.
[20:52.340 --> 20:53.320]  Let you sneak in.
[20:53.840 --> 20:57.160]  But we got to let we got to let Gavin in first.
[20:57.420 --> 20:58.440]  Gavin's got to get in here.
[20:58.540 --> 21:00.120]  I think you need to go in at the same time.
[21:01.140 --> 21:02.280]  Let's not say that.
[21:02.660 --> 21:03.000]  Yeah.
[21:03.580 --> 21:04.400]  All right. You want to come in?
[21:04.540 --> 21:04.760]  I know you.
[21:05.220 --> 21:06.280]  Oh boy, do I.
[21:07.760 --> 21:09.760]  Why'd you run that fast when he said that?
[21:11.500 --> 21:11.860]  There.
[21:16.560 --> 21:17.580]  Oh, that's easy.
[21:18.140 --> 21:19.700]  That's some easy work, guys.
[21:19.940 --> 21:20.780]  Way to go, boys.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.020]  That might be that might be a world record.
[21:23.240 --> 21:24.080]  And that could be.
[21:24.640 --> 21:25.740]  Yeah, it had to have been.
[21:25.880 --> 21:28.920]  I'm going to give some MVP out to Gavin once again.
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.260]  I'm blown away by the speed on that one.
[21:30.960 --> 21:31.980]  I'm feeling good.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.540]  Guys, I'm noticing I'm not getting any MVP votes.
[21:36.760 --> 21:40.740]  I don't know what that's about, but I have noticed that I haven't gotten any.
[21:40.900 --> 21:41.040]  Yeah.
[21:42.420 --> 21:43.540]  Little strange.
[21:45.940 --> 21:51.660]  So you can you sit and then it says it's OK, and then you can leave and it just stays as OK.
[21:52.260 --> 21:53.920]  Oh, that.
[21:55.060 --> 21:55.340]  OK.
[21:56.560 --> 21:57.840]  Oh, wow.
[21:58.440 --> 21:58.960]  Melted.
[22:00.540 --> 22:03.080]  Get your melting pants on.
[22:06.800 --> 22:07.440]  Gavin.
[22:08.720 --> 22:10.180]  He wants to have four needles.
[22:10.880 --> 22:11.200]  Geoff.
[22:13.140 --> 22:14.160]  That was Nick.
[22:14.900 --> 22:15.160]  What?
[22:15.720 --> 22:16.380]  On mine is me.
[22:17.260 --> 22:17.580]  Geoff.
[22:18.380 --> 22:19.740]  I think we see a different screen.
[22:20.320 --> 22:20.880]  Oh, wow.
[22:21.440 --> 22:21.560]  Me.
[22:24.220 --> 22:24.620]  OK.
[22:26.160 --> 22:27.280]  Yeah, this is really easy.
[22:27.300 --> 22:28.140]  I'm going to get the one on the left.
[22:28.340 --> 22:28.820]  Into the hole.
[22:29.700 --> 22:30.220]  I'm going to get.
[22:32.180 --> 22:33.480]  How do I want to do this?
[22:33.580 --> 22:34.080]  I'll get this.
[22:35.200 --> 22:36.120]  Fuck the planet.
[22:37.220 --> 22:37.980]  Melt everything.
[22:40.380 --> 22:40.780]  Yeah.
[22:42.680 --> 22:44.580]  So warm and nice.
[22:46.500 --> 22:48.580]  So nice and warm.
[22:49.200 --> 22:51.300]  All right, I've hit the buttons that you need.
[22:52.360 --> 22:52.600]  OK.
[22:54.480 --> 22:55.580]  Here comes the.
[22:55.800 --> 22:56.280]  Well, I think.
[22:56.740 --> 22:58.460]  Does somebody need to hit this button down here?
[23:00.580 --> 23:01.340]  Is there a button down there?
[23:03.300 --> 23:03.740]  Yeah.
[23:05.020 --> 23:06.200]  That gives you the ball.
[23:08.100 --> 23:12.080]  Oh, you have to you have to make the ball big and then you probably roll it around in the snow
[23:12.880 --> 23:13.660]  and then.
[23:14.280 --> 23:15.380]  Well, don't melt the ball.
[23:15.700 --> 23:17.760]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[23:17.760 --> 23:20.000]  So I can't have a whoever's going to do the ball.
[23:20.100 --> 23:21.200]  Can't have the thing on.
[23:21.420 --> 23:23.300]  That's being considered an MVP voting.
[23:25.280 --> 23:26.080]  No shit.
[23:28.100 --> 23:29.380]  Do you want to play roll the ball?
[23:30.180 --> 23:31.360]  I just could roll it straight.
[23:31.620 --> 23:32.820]  Just roll it straight.
[23:34.960 --> 23:37.860]  I bet if I sat on this, it would take the ball and put it back over here.
[23:38.060 --> 23:40.640]  I wonder if it'll be so big.
[23:42.240 --> 23:42.880]  I'm all right.
[23:42.900 --> 23:43.380]  I got it.
[23:43.800 --> 23:43.840]  Oh, no.
[23:43.840 --> 23:44.300]  Oh, no.
[23:44.500 --> 23:44.780]  Melted.
[23:44.880 --> 23:45.500]  You better get over there.
[23:45.620 --> 23:46.480]  Andrew, stand up.
[23:46.720 --> 23:47.000]  What?
[23:47.240 --> 23:48.440]  Andrew's Andrew's not paying attention.
[23:48.540 --> 23:48.940]  He doesn't care.
[23:51.560 --> 23:54.540]  Gavin, I think it might be better for you to do it because you can go sideways.
[23:55.420 --> 23:56.680]  It's already melted, Gavin.
[23:57.240 --> 23:57.880]  I don't know if I can.
[23:58.000 --> 23:58.300]  I'm scared.
[23:58.400 --> 23:59.260]  I'll knock it in the water.
[23:59.460 --> 23:59.920]  You know what I mean?
[24:00.140 --> 24:03.420]  I think I, Geoff, I think you need to be up there and then.
[24:05.080 --> 24:08.540]  Oh, you're going to have Gavin go and do it at like an angle and sit.
[24:08.660 --> 24:10.500]  Yeah, I think that that's the way that you got to go.
[24:12.080 --> 24:13.080]  Go a bit bigger.
[24:13.440 --> 24:14.060]  There we go.
[24:14.100 --> 24:14.400]  There we go.
[24:14.460 --> 24:14.820]  There we go.
[24:14.900 --> 24:15.540]  Now grab the.
[24:16.760 --> 24:17.120]  Easy.
[24:18.500 --> 24:19.600]  Now grab the melter.
[24:21.960 --> 24:22.700]  Now what do we do?
[24:23.400 --> 24:23.620]  All right.
[24:23.640 --> 24:24.140]  Now what?
[24:24.460 --> 24:25.760]  You guys have buttons to press.
[24:26.740 --> 24:27.640]  Yeah, we were on those.
[24:28.460 --> 24:28.880]  Yeah, right.
[24:28.920 --> 24:32.960]  And then I think you lower on the buttons again and then you guys can walk through because the
[24:32.960 --> 24:33.880]  gate will lower, won't it?
[24:34.220 --> 24:35.120]  Gavin's missing his button.
[24:36.440 --> 24:37.340]  That's our next big Gavin.
[24:37.520 --> 24:37.900]  That's me.
[24:40.960 --> 24:43.040]  And then you just and then you just walk through.
[24:44.320 --> 24:45.120]  Oh, they do.
[24:45.380 --> 24:45.780]  Oh, OK.
[24:45.820 --> 24:48.340]  Then you guys drop there and let us.
[24:48.480 --> 24:49.020]  And then, yeah.
[24:49.560 --> 24:50.940]  And let us in, guys.
[24:52.300 --> 24:54.120]  I appreciate guys.
[24:54.780 --> 24:56.960]  I appreciate the confusion.
[24:57.160 --> 24:58.140]  Not sure what the confusion is.
[24:58.160 --> 24:58.580]  I love it.
[24:59.340 --> 25:00.500]  Oh, my God, Geoff.
[25:02.440 --> 25:03.040]  That's it.
[25:04.700 --> 25:05.920]  There you go.
[25:06.620 --> 25:08.100]  Gavin got off too fast.
[25:09.200 --> 25:11.480]  No, I'm just going to move all the way up.
[25:11.800 --> 25:12.660]  Well, that's a problem.
[25:17.340 --> 25:18.620]  God damn it.
[25:19.420 --> 25:19.940]  Guys.
[25:23.440 --> 25:24.480]  Hey, guys.
[25:25.260 --> 25:26.140]  Yeah, we got you now.
[25:26.860 --> 25:28.180]  Oh, thanks, man.
[25:28.960 --> 25:29.280]  I win.
[25:29.840 --> 25:30.840]  Let me move.
[25:31.020 --> 25:32.740]  Well, no, no.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.840]  Why would you do it?
[25:37.420 --> 25:38.580]  Oh, hold on.
[25:38.600 --> 25:39.060]  I'll get it.
[25:39.440 --> 25:40.220]  It's got you.
[25:41.920 --> 25:42.980]  Andrew's got you, Andrew.
[25:43.580 --> 25:43.860]  Good.
[25:44.420 --> 25:44.700]  All right.
[25:44.760 --> 25:46.860]  Everyone get the first time he's ever had Andrew.
[25:47.080 --> 25:48.180]  I'll get the last here.
[25:50.520 --> 25:51.740]  Where is it, Gavin?
[25:51.920 --> 25:52.300]  Down it.
[25:53.380 --> 25:53.780]  OK.
[25:54.640 --> 25:57.520]  Oh, I was very worried that you'd love the previous section.
[25:57.920 --> 25:59.580]  Did you leave it in the previous section?
[26:00.060 --> 26:00.800]  Big time.
[26:01.700 --> 26:03.060]  You put this game.
[26:05.060 --> 26:07.180]  It's that you can't open any other side.
[26:07.480 --> 26:09.120]  It has to be open from the other side.
[26:09.160 --> 26:10.440]  Gavin's not getting any MVPs.
[26:10.460 --> 26:11.680]  I brought my heater.
[26:12.340 --> 26:13.760]  Raise your hand if you brought your heater.
[26:14.320 --> 26:15.280]  And my hands are raised.
[26:16.120 --> 26:17.740]  To be fair, I was, I love this bull roll.
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.040]  Geoff, go sit on the thing and open the side doors and we'll let Gavin go retrieve his mistake.
[26:23.560 --> 26:24.100]  All right.
[26:24.180 --> 26:24.860]  There you go, Gavin.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.520]  Now you can use the side to go get it.
[26:26.740 --> 26:27.180]  Hell yeah.
[26:27.780 --> 26:29.280]  He can walk down the side.
[26:29.460 --> 26:30.300]  Oh, this is crazy.
[26:31.320 --> 26:33.200]  You can also run, Gavin, by holding A.
[26:33.300 --> 26:35.540]  This is running out of time.
[26:36.240 --> 26:36.720]  Don't worry.
[26:36.820 --> 26:37.620]  Watch the speed.
[26:39.900 --> 26:41.220]  Never say anything like this.
[26:42.120 --> 26:43.000]  I'm watching.
[26:46.980 --> 26:47.360]  All right.
[26:50.100 --> 26:51.000]  Let me move up.
[26:51.060 --> 26:51.440]  Here we go.
[26:53.700 --> 26:57.040]  OK, you go ahead and place that there.
[26:57.700 --> 26:59.340]  Or pretty sure I go here.
[27:00.860 --> 27:01.740]  I'll move it, Gavin.
[27:01.740 --> 27:03.220]  I don't.
[27:03.320 --> 27:03.700]  Oh, shit.
[27:03.820 --> 27:04.040]  Whoops.
[27:04.200 --> 27:04.880]  I was doing a joke.
[27:05.140 --> 27:05.900]  Or actually.
[27:06.120 --> 27:06.640]  Oh, no.
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.260]  No, we're good.
[27:09.320 --> 27:09.520]  We're good.
[27:09.660 --> 27:10.300]  We're good.
[27:12.260 --> 27:14.320]  This is insane.
[27:15.840 --> 27:17.160]  OK, got it.
[27:17.220 --> 27:19.140]  Now I'm going to slide in here.
[27:19.320 --> 27:19.620]  OK.
[27:20.420 --> 27:20.640]  Bloop.
[27:23.560 --> 27:24.940]  Geoff's almost got it.
[27:26.220 --> 27:27.280]  Look at this.
[27:27.620 --> 27:27.880]  OK.
[27:28.100 --> 27:30.000]  Look at this.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.680]  Even after a mistake.
[27:31.960 --> 27:32.360]  Look at that.
[27:32.660 --> 27:34.980]  Oh, beautiful stage clear.
[27:35.520 --> 27:36.120]  The boys are back.
[27:36.240 --> 27:36.380]  All right.
[27:36.400 --> 27:37.000]  Who's the MVP?
[27:37.560 --> 27:38.500]  Give the MVP votes, guys.
[27:38.500 --> 27:40.620]  I know there's only one person I can vote.
[27:41.200 --> 27:42.020]  In my opinion.
[27:42.500 --> 27:43.440]  Apparently it's Nick.
[27:43.780 --> 27:45.000]  Apparently I'm the only one voting.
[27:45.360 --> 27:45.460]  OK.
[27:46.360 --> 27:47.320]  Who voted for Andrew?
[27:47.920 --> 27:48.180]  I did.
[27:49.100 --> 27:49.800]  Oh, you did?
[27:49.960 --> 27:50.460]  I got votes?
[27:51.120 --> 27:52.040]  Hell yeah, man.
[27:52.180 --> 27:53.360]  This is what we call it.
[27:53.580 --> 27:54.620]  Let me incentivize a little bit.
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.680]  There is an achievement for giving away votes.
[27:57.200 --> 27:58.900]  So spam that button.
[28:00.040 --> 28:01.940]  That's the only reason why I'm giving out MVPs.
[28:02.680 --> 28:04.220]  Oh, not thinking about your friends?
[28:04.300 --> 28:05.080]  You're just trying to get the achievement?
[28:05.320 --> 28:06.680]  I'm just trying to get that achievement.
[28:06.920 --> 28:07.120]  Got it.
[28:11.040 --> 28:12.360]  Got to see what's in my ball.
[28:12.600 --> 28:13.360]  Cheerful teacher.
[28:13.680 --> 28:13.900]  New nickname.
[28:14.160 --> 28:14.780]  I got a skin.
[28:15.000 --> 28:15.380]  That's you, man.
[28:15.560 --> 28:15.680]  Puzzle.
[28:16.280 --> 28:17.160]  Nick's got a skin.
[28:17.980 --> 28:19.200]  Fancy purple glasses.
[28:20.580 --> 28:21.540]  That's what I'm wearing.
[28:22.600 --> 28:23.760]  Yeah, that's why you went, eh.
[28:26.460 --> 28:28.740]  Do one more quick opening and then I will...
[28:29.720 --> 28:30.440]  Laughing devil.
[28:30.460 --> 28:31.080]  Oh, ribbon green.
[28:31.160 --> 28:31.360]  OK.
[28:33.160 --> 28:34.300]  Let's head to the board.
[28:34.480 --> 28:35.320]  I'm glad, you know.
[28:35.520 --> 28:38.200]  Keep a thousand people waiting while you look at what hat you got.
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.060]  Yeah, well, you know, it could be a funny thing.
[28:42.180 --> 28:43.700]  Could add to the content of the stream.
[28:43.860 --> 28:44.180]  That's fair.
[28:44.340 --> 28:45.020]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[28:45.040 --> 28:45.240]  That's fair.
[28:46.220 --> 28:47.260]  Could be a funny name.
[28:49.060 --> 28:50.140]  Oh, a chalice.
[28:51.420 --> 28:51.780]  Oh.
[28:55.690 --> 28:57.230]  How's everybody in the chat doing today?
[28:57.350 --> 28:59.190]  Are they throwing the piss rats around or...
[28:59.190 --> 29:00.390]  Yeah, I mean, they're doing good.
[29:00.670 --> 29:01.830]  They're calling me the MVP.
[29:02.150 --> 29:03.170]  Many are saying this.
[29:03.270 --> 29:04.210]  I'm just letting you know.
[29:05.490 --> 29:05.850]  Huh.
[29:06.170 --> 29:06.710]  Oh, yeah.
[29:06.890 --> 29:07.170]  Yeah.
[29:07.410 --> 29:08.670]  Is that many of you?
[29:09.190 --> 29:10.150]  No, many others.
[29:10.470 --> 29:11.610]  Many are saying this, Nick.
[29:13.850 --> 29:15.850]  Chat, chat, chat, piss rat.
[29:17.690 --> 29:18.850]  Oh, match the shade, boys.
[29:19.930 --> 29:20.250]  Easy.
[29:21.010 --> 29:22.410]  Baby mode stuff, man.
[29:22.490 --> 29:22.950]  It's easy.
[29:23.450 --> 29:23.950]  Nick, get that coin.
[29:24.010 --> 29:25.350]  Oh, I'm green.
[29:26.370 --> 29:27.610]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[29:29.390 --> 29:31.230]  Just had a moment where I was like, oh boy.
[29:31.590 --> 29:32.810]  Sit down real quick and cheat on you.
[29:32.890 --> 29:33.250]  Where do you want me to be?
[29:33.390 --> 29:34.250]  Where do you want me to be?
[29:34.370 --> 29:36.650]  I think, Gavin, you're probably the whole bottom.
[29:37.050 --> 29:37.190]  Yeah.
[29:37.250 --> 29:38.150]  Yeah, I think so.
[29:38.250 --> 29:38.570]  Let me...
[29:39.070 --> 29:40.870]  You didn't get the coin though, long man.
[29:41.170 --> 29:42.530]  You didn't get the coin, long man.
[29:42.770 --> 29:43.290]  I'm not moving.
[29:44.570 --> 29:45.270]  You don't blue?
[29:45.910 --> 29:46.990]  Yeah, but I wasn't moving.
[29:47.030 --> 29:47.670]  I was just standing still.
[29:49.770 --> 29:50.170]  Gavin.
[29:50.330 --> 29:51.050]  See, I'm still not moving.
[29:51.890 --> 29:52.910]  Earl with five gifted.
[29:53.030 --> 29:53.470]  Thank you.
[29:53.870 --> 29:54.190]  There we go.
[29:54.230 --> 29:54.510]  Too far.
[29:54.630 --> 29:55.390]  We got it.
[29:58.310 --> 29:59.050]  There you go.
[29:59.870 --> 30:00.270]  Okay.
[30:03.150 --> 30:03.550]  Hmm.
[30:03.770 --> 30:03.910]  What?
[30:03.910 --> 30:04.530]  Why?
[30:04.890 --> 30:05.150]  Okay.
[30:06.170 --> 30:07.530]  No problem solved.
[30:07.790 --> 30:08.150]  No.
[30:12.410 --> 30:13.830]  There you go.
[30:13.830 --> 30:15.750]  And then you got to do a little spinny, Geoff.
[30:16.750 --> 30:17.370]  Oh God.
[30:17.550 --> 30:18.010]  There you go.
[30:18.070 --> 30:19.330]  And then Nick is...
[30:19.330 --> 30:19.490]  Spun me.
[30:19.710 --> 30:20.910]  Oh, way to go, Geoff.
[30:21.070 --> 30:22.370]  I know I'm working on it.
[30:22.490 --> 30:23.450]  There we go.
[30:24.290 --> 30:24.930]  Nope, too low.
[30:26.290 --> 30:27.030]  Nope, too high.
[30:27.350 --> 30:27.630]  All right.
[30:27.630 --> 30:30.090]  You can drop it, buddy.
[30:30.490 --> 30:34.390]  A lot of times I'm dropping it just to lock my position in.
[30:34.490 --> 30:35.390]  Yeah, he's doing a straight drop.
[30:35.390 --> 30:35.870]  Yeah, I get it.
[30:36.070 --> 30:37.030]  That's an intentional drop.
[30:37.130 --> 30:38.010]  Makes total sense, yeah.
[30:38.130 --> 30:40.230]  Gavin, look at all the MVP votes for Gavin.
[30:40.450 --> 30:40.570]  Wow.
[30:42.030 --> 30:42.590]  Who gave those to him?
[30:42.710 --> 30:43.070]  Whoa!
[30:43.790 --> 30:44.230]  I gave it...
[30:44.230 --> 30:44.930]  A tight MVP.
[30:45.290 --> 30:46.010]  Congratulations, boys.
[30:46.130 --> 30:46.330]  Both of them.
[30:46.790 --> 30:47.150]  Wow.
[30:47.430 --> 30:47.790]  Shit.
[30:48.550 --> 30:49.170]  Pretty good.
[30:51.330 --> 30:51.690]  Whoa.
[30:53.530 --> 30:54.510]  I want to play hockey.
[30:55.030 --> 30:55.870]  That's what I want to do.
[30:56.230 --> 30:57.550]  Let's get one of these mini games going.
[30:58.070 --> 30:59.170]  Is there a hockey mini game?
[30:59.350 --> 30:59.550]  Pick it.
[30:59.990 --> 31:00.870]  Yeah, no, you can't.
[31:00.910 --> 31:01.510]  It's just random.
[31:03.710 --> 31:06.030]  But if we get lucky, we'll get a 2v2 hockey game.
[31:08.290 --> 31:09.390]  Whose team do you want to be on?
[31:10.350 --> 31:11.150]  I don't know.
[31:13.410 --> 31:14.430]  That's a good answer.
[31:14.510 --> 31:16.030]  I don't think this is a good answer to that.
[31:18.530 --> 31:20.010]  We got a bunch of grumpy guys.
[31:20.290 --> 31:22.770]  Hey, Eric, I'm really sorry, but can you make sure Geoff gets this
[31:22.770 --> 31:24.710]  and then this is just a picture of the piss rat?
[31:24.930 --> 31:25.390]  Got it.
[31:27.630 --> 31:28.510]  Yeah, you got it.
[31:30.470 --> 31:33.630]  Now, can we slide these big angry faces or...?
[31:34.610 --> 31:35.190]  I think so.
[31:35.690 --> 31:36.050]  Okay.
[31:36.230 --> 31:36.990]  I'd assume so.
[31:37.390 --> 31:37.770]  Are they...
[31:37.770 --> 31:38.190]  Let's give it a shot.
[31:38.290 --> 31:39.010]  This is very...
[31:39.010 --> 31:40.870]  I feel like I recognize this video game.
[31:41.350 --> 31:41.830]  I got you, Gavin.
[31:42.650 --> 31:43.250]  There you go.
[31:45.270 --> 31:46.490]  What are you doing, Andrew?
[31:46.970 --> 31:47.350]  All right.
[31:47.470 --> 31:47.990]  Oh, shit.
[31:48.810 --> 31:49.270]  Geoff, do you...
[31:49.270 --> 31:49.750]  Can you push me?
[31:49.830 --> 31:52.790]  You need to hook onto that bad boy?
[31:53.190 --> 31:54.130]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:54.310 --> 31:54.590]  Okay.
[31:55.410 --> 31:56.830]  Well, let me out there.
[31:56.850 --> 31:57.310]  There you go.
[31:57.630 --> 31:58.370]  There we go.
[31:59.090 --> 32:01.250]  And then let me move this way.
[32:01.410 --> 32:01.810]  Hold on, stop.
[32:01.930 --> 32:02.450]  Keep going up.
[32:02.670 --> 32:02.790]  Okay.
[32:03.130 --> 32:03.370]  Yeah.
[32:03.750 --> 32:04.210]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:04.470 --> 32:06.130]  And then I'll move past you, so I don't...
[32:06.130 --> 32:06.990]  Make it their problem?
[32:07.210 --> 32:08.650]  You go past me.
[32:09.750 --> 32:10.750]  All right, you go past me.
[32:11.110 --> 32:11.590]  Oh, shit.
[32:11.770 --> 32:12.230]  Oh, shit.
[32:12.770 --> 32:13.610]  Okay, now you go ahead.
[32:14.410 --> 32:15.010]  They need to push...
[32:15.590 --> 32:17.250]  And then we need to push it up or down.
[32:18.150 --> 32:18.970]  Okay, well, that'll work.
[32:19.130 --> 32:20.070]  All right, I can hook from the top.
[32:20.310 --> 32:20.870]  I can hook from the top.
[32:21.050 --> 32:22.470]  Yeah, they'll push that lower one across,
[32:22.530 --> 32:23.750]  and then you can push the upper one down.
[32:24.350 --> 32:25.330]  Well, spin me?
[32:27.850 --> 32:29.770]  All right, so how do you want us to do it?
[32:29.870 --> 32:31.730]  We'll just move this all the way to the left.
[32:31.850 --> 32:31.970]  Ah, I see.
[32:32.250 --> 32:33.330]  And then I'll push it down for you guys.
[32:33.590 --> 32:33.910]  Okay.
[32:34.630 --> 32:35.030]  All right, Geoff.
[32:35.130 --> 32:35.790]  I'll be your support.
[32:35.790 --> 32:36.310]  Go over this way.
[32:36.690 --> 32:37.110]  Yeah, there you go.
[32:37.110 --> 32:37.890]  Thank you, Gavin.
[32:39.270 --> 32:40.730]  Oh, maybe Geoff can hook it with you.
[32:40.850 --> 32:41.850]  Oh, yeah, is it too much?
[32:41.850 --> 32:43.390]  It's a bigger one, so we need both sides.
[32:43.470 --> 32:43.770]  There we go.
[32:44.270 --> 32:44.390]  Nice.
[32:46.790 --> 32:47.110]  Yay!
[32:48.370 --> 32:49.050]  Look at this.
[32:49.530 --> 32:50.050]  Look at that teamwork.
[32:52.170 --> 32:52.810]  Yeah, teamwork.
[32:54.990 --> 32:55.890]  What a team.
[32:57.090 --> 32:57.850]  What a team.
[32:59.250 --> 32:59.510]  Oops.
[33:00.290 --> 33:00.730]  Am I in the middle?
[33:01.790 --> 33:02.870]  What's the, what's the layout?
[33:03.090 --> 33:03.610]  Let's see.
[33:05.470 --> 33:06.050]  There you go.
[33:06.210 --> 33:06.530]  There we go.
[33:09.350 --> 33:10.210]  God damn it.
[33:11.090 --> 33:12.050]  God damn it, Gavin.
[33:16.250 --> 33:16.650]  Gavin!
[33:16.870 --> 33:17.170]  Andrew.
[33:17.290 --> 33:18.210]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[33:18.390 --> 33:18.910]  Come on.
[33:22.450 --> 33:23.190]  God damn it.
[33:24.150 --> 33:25.070]  You didn't use me!
[33:25.250 --> 33:25.770]  There you go.
[33:26.090 --> 33:26.330]  Geez.
[33:26.690 --> 33:27.430]  I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing.
[33:27.450 --> 33:28.350]  I'm doing it.
[33:29.990 --> 33:30.890]  You know what?
[33:31.750 --> 33:32.190]  MVP.
[33:32.690 --> 33:33.130]  Achievement!
[33:33.730 --> 33:34.410]  The good helper.
[33:34.590 --> 33:35.430]  You got a Chivo.
[33:36.030 --> 33:36.970]  Cleared 50 stages.
[33:37.490 --> 33:40.250]  Maybe I was subconsciously doing a bit the last time.
[33:40.450 --> 33:40.710]  Whoa.
[33:41.030 --> 33:42.390]  Nick, you're nailing today.
[33:42.510 --> 33:42.950]  I don't know how.
[33:43.050 --> 33:44.030]  Hey, thanks, man.
[33:44.230 --> 33:44.930]  Oh, you know what?
[33:44.950 --> 33:45.810]  I'm being patient.
[33:46.130 --> 33:46.950]  I'm taking my time.
[33:47.050 --> 33:47.510]  I'm thinking.
[33:47.690 --> 33:48.130]  I'm watching.
[33:48.430 --> 33:51.530]  And Andrew's really taking the slack of territory.
[33:52.190 --> 33:53.770]  You know, when you're right, you're right.
[34:00.350 --> 34:01.170]  Andrew, are you okay?
[34:01.750 --> 34:02.390]  I'm good.
[34:02.510 --> 34:03.290]  I'm just, you know what?
[34:06.750 --> 34:08.890]  That was the end of that thought.
[34:09.710 --> 34:12.450]  I was going to change my nickname, but everyone else readied up so quickly.
[34:12.550 --> 34:13.790]  I didn't want to make everyone wait for me.
[34:13.890 --> 34:15.190]  Ooh, what are we doing here?
[34:15.890 --> 34:17.170]  We'll find out when we get in the level.
[34:17.510 --> 34:17.790]  Calm down.
[34:20.770 --> 34:21.410]  All right.
[34:21.550 --> 34:21.850]  All right.
[34:22.030 --> 34:23.010]  Forget my excitement.
[34:23.430 --> 34:24.210]  I'm fucking with you, Nick.
[34:24.270 --> 34:24.530]  I'm sorry.
[34:25.010 --> 34:27.290]  Andrew, you want to do a new nickname next lobby?
[34:27.290 --> 34:29.670]  I would love to do a new nickname next lobby.
[34:29.770 --> 34:31.690]  I'm not feeling this husky detective right now.
[34:33.430 --> 34:34.810]  I think I'm trying to...
[34:34.810 --> 34:37.290]  I'm pushing too hard to solve this crime that doesn't exist.
[34:37.610 --> 34:37.730]  Yeah.
[34:38.710 --> 34:39.290]  Oh, yeah?
[34:39.450 --> 34:40.330]  You need to take a step back.
[34:40.670 --> 34:41.570]  I can do a crime if you want.
[34:41.590 --> 34:43.050]  You're too close to it, Andrew.
[34:43.650 --> 34:44.310]  Oh, shit.
[34:45.230 --> 34:45.950]  Exploding plants?
[34:47.070 --> 34:47.410]  Uh-oh.
[34:48.070 --> 34:48.590]  Oh, shit.
[34:48.670 --> 34:49.350]  Do they kill us?
[34:49.350 --> 34:50.590]  Oh, they push air out.
[34:51.010 --> 34:51.550]  They fart.
[34:51.670 --> 34:52.510]  They're fart plants.
[34:52.890 --> 34:54.190]  I think you need to move the heater.
[34:54.770 --> 34:55.130]  Okay.
[34:56.310 --> 34:56.590]  Okay.
[34:56.950 --> 34:58.010]  Can I melt the plants?
[35:00.030 --> 35:01.270]  Ah, you got up with the heater.
[35:03.490 --> 35:03.770]  Huh.
[35:04.670 --> 35:04.950]  Okay.
[35:05.330 --> 35:06.330]  Oh, we got the snowball.
[35:08.210 --> 35:08.490]  Right.
[35:09.410 --> 35:09.690]  Yeah.
[35:10.070 --> 35:10.910]  Let's get it going bigger.
[35:11.750 --> 35:12.550]  You just need to put it in the hole.
[35:12.550 --> 35:13.010]  Oh, my God.
[35:14.310 --> 35:14.550]  Ah.
[35:14.990 --> 35:15.790]  All right, I'm keeping it.
[35:16.890 --> 35:17.510]  Yep, don't worry.
[35:17.550 --> 35:18.170]  Gavin's got it.
[35:18.670 --> 35:19.290]  Gavin's keeping it.
[35:19.410 --> 35:20.390]  That's blowing it.
[35:21.570 --> 35:22.850]  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[35:22.870 --> 35:23.270]  There you got it.
[35:23.270 --> 35:24.150]  You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it.
[35:24.330 --> 35:25.050]  Nice, nice, nice.
[35:25.050 --> 35:25.570]  Easy.
[35:27.490 --> 35:28.270]  GG, easy.
[35:28.670 --> 35:28.870]  Coin, coin.
[35:29.370 --> 35:29.770]  Bullshit.
[35:31.250 --> 35:32.570]  And I'm already where I need to be.
[35:36.120 --> 35:38.000]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[35:40.820 --> 35:41.240]  Oh, aced it.
[35:41.240 --> 35:42.020]  Look at this.
[35:42.100 --> 35:42.700]  Aced it.
[35:42.980 --> 35:43.140]  Wow.
[35:43.140 --> 35:43.980]  Fucking aced it.
[35:44.160 --> 35:45.120]  Another world record.
[35:45.520 --> 35:46.040]  Put it on the board.
[35:46.840 --> 35:49.160]  That was pretty impressive, actually.
[35:49.300 --> 35:49.720]  Vote, vote.
[35:50.720 --> 35:51.960]  Ah, the achievement, I need to vote.
[35:52.020 --> 35:52.520]  I need to vote.
[35:53.460 --> 35:54.060]  How do we vote?
[35:54.160 --> 35:54.480]  Which stick?
[35:54.500 --> 35:55.620]  Hit any of the buttons.
[35:56.560 --> 35:57.660]  Any of the buttons.
[36:01.940 --> 36:03.040]  Smash those buttons.
[36:03.420 --> 36:04.360]  Oh, it's the buttons?
[36:04.480 --> 36:05.840]  I thought it was the stick.
[36:06.060 --> 36:07.960]  It's just showing you up, down, left, and right.
[36:08.360 --> 36:11.160]  And it's going to, I don't know, this is too, this is a little too many on me.
[36:12.600 --> 36:14.120]  That's very cool to hear, dude.
[36:14.320 --> 36:15.760]  And congratulations on your accomplishment.
[36:16.640 --> 36:17.920]  Yeah, I'm proud of you.
[36:18.160 --> 36:18.860]  Yeah, Nick's proud of you.
[36:19.440 --> 36:19.640]  Yeah.
[36:21.340 --> 36:22.900]  Ooh, I got some owns.
[36:24.600 --> 36:25.840]  Oh, I want to look at my shit.
[36:26.540 --> 36:28.440]  Oh, yeah, I think Gavin, yeah.
[36:28.820 --> 36:29.980]  Or, oh, there you go, Andrew.
[36:30.360 --> 36:31.940]  I like the, oh, wizard's good, too.
[36:32.940 --> 36:34.440]  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[36:34.560 --> 36:34.980]  Okay, cool.
[36:35.260 --> 36:35.600]  Yeah, there you go.
[36:35.620 --> 36:37.000]  Oh, fancy blue glass is great.
[36:37.020 --> 36:37.560]  Yeah, there you go.
[36:37.860 --> 36:38.100]  All right.
[36:38.580 --> 36:39.500]  Andrew's got the, uh...
[36:39.500 --> 36:40.840]  Spin the wheel of Gavin's annoyance.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.980]  Flower pot, that doesn't make it funnier.
[36:44.920 --> 36:46.440]  How do you change your name?
[36:47.960 --> 36:48.600]  Oh, there it is.
[36:49.000 --> 36:49.360]  Nope.
[36:50.340 --> 36:50.680]  Oh, yes.
[36:50.740 --> 36:51.400]  Spin it one more time.
[36:52.660 --> 36:55.220]  This should be like a rock soundtrack option for this game.
[36:56.240 --> 36:56.600]  Shiny.
[36:58.060 --> 36:59.900]  Yeah, this is, this music.
[37:00.300 --> 37:01.940]  You can change the music at my jukebox.
[37:03.660 --> 37:04.500]  Jukebox, Geoffrey.
[37:04.500 --> 37:04.880]  What's that?
[37:05.160 --> 37:06.440]  Run into my house, my yellow house.
[37:07.720 --> 37:08.640]  There you go.
[37:09.200 --> 37:09.680]  Top left.
[37:10.040 --> 37:11.260]  And then go to the top left, yeah.
[37:11.340 --> 37:13.940]  Go to my bottom right house, and then the top left of the house.
[37:14.300 --> 37:14.440]  Yep.
[37:15.940 --> 37:17.860]  It's not my house, I can't, I don't...
[37:17.860 --> 37:20.460]  Can't, fucking, you think you can control my, you think I'd let you?
[37:20.660 --> 37:21.060]  Get out of here.
[37:22.900 --> 37:23.520]  It's mine.
[37:24.180 --> 37:26.240]  Get your grubby face away from it.
[37:27.740 --> 37:30.620]  Do you have the biggest house because you're the host of this game?
[37:31.100 --> 37:31.620]  I'm not the host.
[37:32.540 --> 37:35.100]  Oh, well, that answers that question.
[37:35.220 --> 37:36.260]  It's because I've played more levels.
[37:37.480 --> 37:38.880]  You eventually get a house upgrade.
[37:39.720 --> 37:40.900]  You play it without us?
[37:40.960 --> 37:41.420]  So I just change the music?
[37:41.840 --> 37:41.940]  Yeah.
[37:42.340 --> 37:44.340]  Of course he played without you.
[37:45.000 --> 37:45.400]  That's nuts.
[37:45.680 --> 37:45.800]  Wow.
[37:46.040 --> 37:46.560]  That's crazy.
[37:46.760 --> 37:47.060]  That's crazy.
[37:48.960 --> 37:50.400]  How do you think I got so smart?
[37:51.720 --> 37:52.800]  Yeah, he's a laid back genius.
[37:52.800 --> 37:53.460]  Yep.
[37:53.620 --> 37:54.020]  Hockey!
[37:54.340 --> 37:55.500]  Oh, hockey!
[37:56.140 --> 37:56.540]  Fuck.
[37:56.900 --> 37:57.760]  Okay, here we go.
[37:58.360 --> 37:58.920]  Oh, boy.
[37:59.140 --> 37:59.940]  Let's lock it in.
[38:01.160 --> 38:01.960]  Oh, boy.
[38:02.920 --> 38:03.980]  It's me and Geoff.
[38:04.860 --> 38:06.020]  Oh, let's go, Andrew!
[38:06.520 --> 38:07.120]  Plan G.
[38:08.940 --> 38:09.860]  Can you make your defense?
[38:09.940 --> 38:10.520]  We got this.
[38:10.960 --> 38:12.020]  Okay, I'll stay in back.
[38:12.140 --> 38:12.640]  All right, Gavin.
[38:12.960 --> 38:14.160]  Your offense, I'll be defense.
[38:14.160 --> 38:15.180]  Oh, wait, are we all the same shape?
[38:15.260 --> 38:15.640]  Maybe not.
[38:15.700 --> 38:16.320]  Maybe it doesn't matter.
[38:16.740 --> 38:18.380]  Remember, uh, remember you can straighten out.
[38:18.600 --> 38:18.900]  Bum rush it?
[38:19.240 --> 38:20.140]  Yeah, I'll be defense.
[38:21.380 --> 38:21.700]  Okay.
[38:21.940 --> 38:22.480]  I'll be a goalie.
[38:27.210 --> 38:27.530]  What?
[38:28.150 --> 38:28.670]  I'm too harassed.
[38:28.670 --> 38:29.570]  Oh, shit.
[38:31.890 --> 38:32.430]  Oh, get in there!
[38:32.450 --> 38:33.270]  Oh, I can barely...
[38:33.270 --> 38:35.010]  Oh my god, it's hard to move fast, huh?
[38:35.410 --> 38:35.730]  Get it?
[38:35.930 --> 38:37.030]  The whole day it's a sprint, though.
[38:37.630 --> 38:37.790]  Yeah.
[38:39.470 --> 38:40.730]  Oh, look at that big one.
[38:40.970 --> 38:41.110]  Shit, shit, shit.
[38:41.110 --> 38:41.990]  All right, here we go, boys.
[38:42.830 --> 38:43.370]  Give me the...
[38:43.370 --> 38:43.750]  Give me this.
[38:44.110 --> 38:44.910]  Geoff, go nuts.
[38:45.210 --> 38:45.570]  There you go.
[38:45.890 --> 38:46.750]  Oh, Andrew!
[38:47.570 --> 38:48.150]  Fuck this.
[38:48.230 --> 38:48.750]  I'm playing offense.
[38:49.010 --> 38:49.370]  Geoff, get it going.
[38:49.370 --> 38:49.790]  Yeah, fuck it.
[38:49.790 --> 38:50.630]  Let's just push it.
[38:50.850 --> 38:51.550]  Push it!
[38:52.110 --> 38:53.030]  We gotta stop it.
[38:53.070 --> 38:53.210]  No!
[38:53.470 --> 38:53.890]  There we go.
[38:53.930 --> 38:54.250]  There we go.
[38:54.310 --> 38:54.630]  There we go.
[38:54.630 --> 38:55.970]  Get it, go, get it, go.
[38:57.110 --> 38:57.510]  No!
[38:57.630 --> 38:58.470]  Get that big motherfucker!
[38:58.930 --> 39:01.970]  No easy shit, no easy shit, no easy shit, no easy shit, no easy shit, no easy shit.
[39:02.070 --> 39:04.250]  Oh, spin it, spin it, spin it like Batman!
[39:06.790 --> 39:07.190]  Shit.
[39:09.170 --> 39:09.850]  There it is.
[39:09.950 --> 39:10.810]  Oh, Geoff.
[39:11.390 --> 39:11.730]  No.
[39:11.950 --> 39:12.590]  Fuck off!
[39:12.730 --> 39:13.010]  No!
[39:13.350 --> 39:14.150]  The bombs!
[39:14.630 --> 39:14.930]  Yeah!
[39:15.210 --> 39:16.890]  The fucking bombs!
[39:18.230 --> 39:18.610]  Oh, shit.
[39:18.790 --> 39:19.170]  Hit the big one.
[39:19.450 --> 39:19.870]  Geoff, no!
[39:19.870 --> 39:20.570]  Big one, big one!
[39:20.810 --> 39:21.230]  Geoff, no!
[39:21.230 --> 39:21.970]  All right, no, stop it!
[39:21.990 --> 39:22.270]  Big one!
[39:22.410 --> 39:23.030]  No, stop it!
[39:23.170 --> 39:23.370]  Yes!
[39:23.770 --> 39:24.430]  Good job, Andrew!
[39:24.630 --> 39:26.070]  It's still a game!
[39:27.930 --> 39:28.410]  Oh!
[39:28.650 --> 39:29.270]  30 seconds!
[39:29.910 --> 39:30.010]  Yes!
[39:32.130 --> 39:35.370]  They're up 10, plenty of time.
[39:35.690 --> 39:39.030]  Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push!
[39:39.970 --> 39:40.630]  Get it off him.
[39:41.130 --> 39:43.330]  No, it's too close.
[39:43.930 --> 39:45.410]  No, get it, no, no, no.
[39:45.630 --> 39:47.150]  Push, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, yes!
[39:47.950 --> 39:49.610]  They're only down by three!
[39:49.970 --> 39:51.570]  Oh no, that one's bouncing!
[39:51.830 --> 39:52.470]  Seven seconds!
[39:53.030 --> 39:53.370]  Five!
[39:53.370 --> 39:53.850]  You got this.
[39:59.170 --> 40:12.390]  My country's gonna be so ashamed. Get in the goal. Gavin, he's my hero. He's my MVP. Good
[40:12.390 --> 40:23.070]  job, buddy. Good job, you. That was pretty tense. That was surprisingly tense. Pretty
[40:26.150 --> 40:34.010]  serious. You want to swap to the next region? Do we have it already? The Quilted Quarry.
[40:34.330 --> 40:38.750]  I believe it's the toughest one. I don't have that one. It's locked for me. Oh, you don't
[40:38.750 --> 40:42.310]  have that one? Okay, I'll vote for it and you guys vote for the ice one. All right.
[40:42.490 --> 40:49.750]  Okay, done. I gotta go put my new clothes on real fast. What's this? Is this the leave
[40:49.750 --> 40:58.200]  door? Yeah, that's how people come into the world. Okay. They're born from it. Achievements
[40:58.200 --> 41:09.520]  real quick. Oh, I'm so close. You're very close. This bell doesn't ring. Gavin. Well,
[41:10.600 --> 41:15.200]  I think that's the code bell, is it? Oh, that's like the matchmaking bell. The bell is on
[41:15.200 --> 41:33.020]  the or the code is on the TV. Come on, quarry. Yeah. Are there cannons? I like your little
[41:33.560 --> 41:39.460]  horns, your little fruit demon horns. Yeah, my little ones. A shining gentleman. I'm just
[41:39.460 --> 41:49.100]  saying. Except for annoying millionaire. Everybody step back. I got this. I'm the genius
[41:49.100 --> 42:00.260]  here. Use the wind and turn on the lamp. Oh, get those coins. An achievement? Damn. Oh,
[42:00.520 --> 42:10.510]  dear. Oh, dear. Okay, we just got to get them all spinning. It isn't hard. Oh, my God, you
[42:10.510 --> 42:15.610]  budged the shit out of me. I think you have to move that block, Gavin. You can't. Oh,
[42:15.670 --> 42:21.170]  really? Yeah, I just want to aim my wind at it. It doesn't move it. Sorry, I twatted the
[42:21.170 --> 42:28.990]  shit out of you. Can I hook it? Yeah, I think so. No, no. We just got it. There you go,
[42:29.030 --> 42:34.290]  Gavin. You got it. Oh, we just need to make sure they're all happening at the same time.
[42:34.290 --> 42:45.690]  Son of the... what? Son of the bitch. Dawn of the bitch? So shouldn't it be angled Andrew
[42:45.690 --> 42:56.030]  at the... Yeah, yeah. Oh, way to go. Oh, wow, Nick came in. Nick, what do you think is
[42:56.030 --> 43:01.300]  happening? What do you mean? Like, what do you think is happening here? Like, if you
[43:01.300 --> 43:06.480]  describe it to me, what do you think you have to do? We just need pink. There we go.
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.120]  Wow. What do you mean? Tap them all at the same time, do we? We had to get them all moving
[43:10.120 --> 43:13.620]  at the same time. What the fuck did you think was happening? It seemed like you were trying
[43:13.620 --> 43:17.980]  to move it as fast as you could instead of just pointing the fan at the thing. Yeah,
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.380]  but the fan just needed to move. Twatted to turn on, doesn't it? Yeah, yeah. It just looked
[43:23.380 --> 43:29.880]  like watching everyone move with precision and in the bottom left, you are going as hard
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.980]  as you can left and right was awesome. Yeah, but Nick's could just twat back and forth
[43:34.980 --> 43:40.060]  and keep on the whole time. Right, which is what I was doing. Yeah. To make it so that
[43:40.060 --> 43:44.480]  we wouldn't have a downtime. And then he'd run over and bump Gavin and go, oh shit, hang
[43:44.480 --> 43:54.160]  on. Well, that was before I figured it out. Oh, man. Oh, shit. I got a wooden bench. You
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.680]  got a new nameplate. Finally get some furniture in this house. I don't know what it was in
[44:00.680 --> 44:03.860]  reference to Gavin, but I just saw in the chat, somebody said that Geoff is more American
[44:03.860 --> 44:07.940]  than Gavin is British. And I don't know why, but I kind of agree with them. Yeah, I think
[44:07.940 --> 44:12.180]  that's right. Well, yeah. I mean, if you maybe if you lived in England for 12 years, you'd
[44:12.180 --> 44:21.660]  be less American. That's true. Yeah. I also have the unfair advantage of having served
[44:21.660 --> 44:30.760]  in the military, which is always like, which gives you the patriotism plus one. See, I'm
[44:30.760 --> 44:37.580]  from England where we're born without patriotism. You can just tell, like, in their demeanor
[44:37.580 --> 44:43.900]  and stuff. Like, if we see something that says made in Britain, you're just like, no, this
[44:43.900 --> 44:49.340]  is going to suck. Gavin's like, well, I'm made in Britain and I know what's wrong with
[44:50.160 --> 44:52.980]  the heater. Why couldn't this be made in Portugal?
[44:54.600 --> 45:02.800]  Uh, that ice. OK, just run fast on it. All right, melt my bowl.
[45:03.900 --> 45:06.200]  I don't know why we're obsessed with melting balls over here.
[45:06.400 --> 45:09.700]  We got it. Oh, God, it's moving too close to me. It's moving too close to me.
[45:10.060 --> 45:16.100]  You tried running away. Get back. Why are you touching? Get back. Nick, get back.
[45:17.300 --> 45:19.180]  Andrew, I still need to melt it a little.
[45:19.180 --> 45:24.840]  Get back. I don't think that's true. I'm a genius. Trust me. Gavin, put it in the hole.
[45:26.160 --> 45:30.340]  Put it in the hole. I think you're going to have to melt it a little bit.
[45:30.440 --> 45:33.340]  Put it in the hole. I'm a genius. Trust me.
[45:33.840 --> 45:37.340]  OK, what now, genius? All right, genius.
[45:37.800 --> 45:42.000]  Now we wait for global warming. Everybody group up. Six years. Six years we're going to hang out
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  here. I'm going to evaluate.
[45:46.520 --> 45:48.800]  I think other people need to push it while Nick melts it a little bit.
[45:49.640 --> 45:50.960]  Just melt it a little bit.
[45:53.400 --> 45:59.840]  That's enough. Oh, Nick. Oh, Nick. I got it. All right. Good job, everyone. It's perfect.
[45:59.980 --> 46:04.280]  Good group think. Oh, ow. That was a test. I was testing you.
[46:07.980 --> 46:10.380]  All right, now do we need to get another bowl from the start?
[46:10.540 --> 46:12.840]  Looks like someone else when you use this is less.
[46:13.280 --> 46:15.380]  OK, there it is. Got your ball.
[46:16.380 --> 46:18.040]  I just go ahead and put it where it goes.
[46:21.080 --> 46:22.560]  Yeah. Probably have to melt it a little.
[46:22.840 --> 46:23.680]  So grab this.
[46:25.240 --> 46:29.040]  Moving with you. Yeah, yeah. Nick, I think this is good.
[46:29.580 --> 46:31.540]  Yeah, and I'll block it so it doesn't come off the ledge.
[46:31.880 --> 46:34.660]  Nice. Oh, it's beautiful. And then Geoff will push it down.
[46:35.120 --> 46:36.480]  And then Geoff. Oh, there it goes.
[46:37.740 --> 46:42.460]  There you go, boys. Too much melt. Too much melt. Stop pushing me, Geoff!
[46:44.380 --> 46:48.940]  No, we got part of it. Oh, my God. We got partial floor.
[46:48.940 --> 46:51.620]  Partial melting. Partial melting.
[46:51.800 --> 46:53.680]  I like that. I like that part because Geoff helped.
[46:54.320 --> 46:58.280]  Thank you. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.040]  All right, Gavin, I'm going to use you as a... OK.
[47:03.420 --> 47:03.960]  Where do you want me?
[47:05.400 --> 47:07.260]  Yeah. Just smack it down.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.460]  Get out of there. No, we need more snow.
[47:10.520 --> 47:11.600]  No, no, it's good. It's fine. It's fine.
[47:11.600 --> 47:12.940]  We've already got some. It's fine. That'll fill.
[47:13.020 --> 47:15.280]  That'll fill it. It'll fill it.
[47:15.700 --> 47:18.040]  Yeah, you're right.
[47:18.940 --> 47:20.040]  I know. I know.
[47:20.200 --> 47:21.740]  Nick knows his snow. He knows his melt.
[47:22.320 --> 47:24.480]  I know the melty snow.
[47:28.300 --> 47:29.680]  Yep. Excuse me. Pardon.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.020]  All right. Pick that up again.
[47:36.740 --> 47:38.400]  Oh, look. Oh, look.
[47:38.420 --> 47:39.960]  And then you fit just like that. Isn't that great?
[47:41.800 --> 47:43.600]  Why do I have it? I don't want it.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.300]  That's. Well, this surely is incorrect.
[47:53.640 --> 47:54.900]  It's not me that's wrong.
[47:57.520 --> 48:00.300]  Geoff, are you sure it's not you that's wrong?
[48:00.600 --> 48:04.460]  I'm positive I'm a genius, but I'm real laid back about it.
[48:05.480 --> 48:06.820]  All right, where would you like me to go?
[48:10.340 --> 48:11.540]  You guys got to swap.
[48:11.800 --> 48:12.840]  Yeah, Gavin goes up there.
[48:14.020 --> 48:15.060]  Geoff, you go to the bottom.
[48:17.900 --> 48:21.220]  And you. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Yeah.
[48:21.720 --> 48:23.580]  Easy. Oh, just like that.
[48:23.740 --> 48:25.960]  Well, is that slightly wrong angle?
[48:26.900 --> 48:28.380]  Was it like that? A little off.
[48:28.820 --> 48:30.560]  That's OK. Now you'll figure it out.
[48:30.620 --> 48:31.240]  It's like that, right?
[48:31.260 --> 48:32.440]  You got it. Yeah.
[48:38.500 --> 48:40.900]  SpecterPanzers wants to know if this is a bit, but I don't.
[48:41.020 --> 48:42.820]  Somebody thinks Andrew's paying GTA right now.
[48:46.940 --> 48:47.660]  Physically, I'm here.
[48:47.760 --> 48:48.560]  Mentally, I'm there.
[48:50.860 --> 48:53.320]  Hey, thanks for coming and hanging out on Friday
[48:53.320 --> 48:55.900]  at the best time of the fucking week with us.
[48:55.940 --> 48:56.840]  Almost there, man.
[48:57.540 --> 48:58.680]  501 so close.
[48:59.560 --> 49:01.300]  Fucking got it in our sights right now.
[49:01.340 --> 49:02.260]  We're about to pull the trigger.
[49:02.480 --> 49:07.000]  Blat blat 501 dead bleeding out right in front of us.
[49:07.260 --> 49:10.500]  We've got a weekend to roll around in the blood and relax and enjoy life.
[49:10.640 --> 49:12.800]  We have to put our clothes back on and go to work Monday.
[49:13.500 --> 49:14.240]  All the what?
[49:14.620 --> 49:16.340]  Aren't we doing work tomorrow?
[49:17.060 --> 49:17.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:18.720 --> 49:19.820]  So what's happening?
[49:19.880 --> 49:21.040]  Doesn't fit the narrative, Eric.
[49:21.460 --> 49:22.400]  I don't need to know that.
[49:23.960 --> 49:25.540]  I'm just saying it's making me nervous.
[49:27.980 --> 49:29.540]  Let us roll around in the blood.
[49:30.060 --> 49:30.700]  I'm not working.
[49:31.020 --> 49:31.960]  Without clothes?
[49:32.360 --> 49:33.120]  Yeah, of course.
[49:33.200 --> 49:34.440]  I don't want to get blood on my clothes.
[49:34.540 --> 49:35.560]  That shit does not come out.
[49:36.020 --> 49:38.880]  Can we start a new thing where like it similar to a blindside?
[49:39.020 --> 49:40.900]  One of us could just shout blood bomb.
[49:42.140 --> 49:44.540]  And I could throw a bomb of blood at someone.
[49:44.540 --> 49:46.280]  What the fuck?
[49:46.280 --> 49:47.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:47.380 --> 49:48.220]  What does that do?
[49:48.380 --> 49:48.860]  Fake blood.
[49:49.160 --> 49:52.080]  It just like gives them a little bit of a problem being in public.
[49:53.100 --> 49:57.180]  Gavin's saying he's reinventing the wheel when really he's just reintroducing Moonball.
[49:58.660 --> 49:59.460]  Different language.
[50:00.260 --> 50:01.340]  Ah, we're getting pooped!
[50:01.440 --> 50:02.700]  This level might be crazy.
[50:03.360 --> 50:06.220]  No, I don't want to like blood bomb our office if we get one.
[50:06.820 --> 50:07.860]  I also don't.
[50:09.620 --> 50:11.500]  Oh, well now I kind of want to do a little bit more.
[50:12.280 --> 50:12.980]  Stop pushing me!
[50:18.180 --> 50:19.380]  Should I go on the bottom left?
[50:19.480 --> 50:20.460]  Is that what it wants from me?
[50:21.160 --> 50:21.800]  Oh, I pushed it.
[50:21.880 --> 50:22.820]  That was romantic, Geoff.
[50:22.860 --> 50:24.080]  You and I got pushed into each other.
[50:24.620 --> 50:26.220]  I think I might...
[50:26.220 --> 50:27.160]  Holy shit!
[50:27.260 --> 50:29.220]  I think I might be the bottom.
[50:29.700 --> 50:30.220]  Is that right?
[50:30.740 --> 50:32.080]  Pretty sure I'm right here.
[50:33.020 --> 50:34.200]  Well, who's going to go to the right of you?
[50:34.200 --> 50:35.180]  With a one space?
[50:36.960 --> 50:38.060]  I think he's being...
[50:38.060 --> 50:40.020]  He was being a laid-back genius.
[50:41.860 --> 50:43.180]  I already figured this out.
[50:43.240 --> 50:46.020]  I've seen how long it takes y'all to figure this out because I'm...
[50:46.020 --> 50:48.000]  I'm waiting for everybody else to get into position.
[50:48.000 --> 50:48.720]  So I can...
[50:49.660 --> 50:50.680]  I was going to go there.
[50:50.880 --> 50:51.240]  Is that right?
[50:51.380 --> 50:53.120]  Yeah, hang out there and see how it works.
[50:53.220 --> 50:54.620]  And then Nick can go lock in.
[50:57.900 --> 50:59.140]  You better be fast!
[50:59.320 --> 50:59.680]  It's fun though.
[50:59.780 --> 51:00.200]  There you go.
[51:01.000 --> 51:01.440]  Got it.
[51:01.920 --> 51:02.680]  You got to sit down.
[51:03.200 --> 51:03.940]  Yeah, I'm working on it.
[51:03.960 --> 51:04.380]  There you go.
[51:06.720 --> 51:08.160]  What if this guy will spin me around?
[51:09.680 --> 51:10.080]  There we go.
[51:10.320 --> 51:10.880]  Nice, Geoff!
[51:10.900 --> 51:11.660]  Nick, right there.
[51:12.680 --> 51:12.940]  It's true.
[51:15.060 --> 51:15.780]  Hey, good point.
[51:16.480 --> 51:17.520]  It's 100% true.
[51:22.420 --> 51:25.160]  What are you doing?
[51:29.660 --> 51:31.400]  Oh, it spun me back the wrong way again.
[51:31.880 --> 51:32.680]  That's a problem.
[51:34.200 --> 51:36.320]  Oh, that's the opposite of the way I want to go.
[51:36.680 --> 51:37.760]  What am I going to do?
[51:38.820 --> 51:39.860]  What am I going to do?
[51:39.960 --> 51:40.800]  It keeps spinning me around.
[51:41.080 --> 51:41.740]  I don't know.
[51:42.620 --> 51:43.880]  I'm all out of sorts.
[51:44.480 --> 51:44.680]  No!
[51:45.460 --> 51:47.020]  Nick, why did you stand up?
[51:47.140 --> 51:47.820]  Why'd you come in?
[51:47.940 --> 51:49.900]  I was laughing so hard I touched the button.
[51:49.900 --> 51:50.800]  I can't be done.
[51:51.660 --> 51:52.740]  That's as good as I can get.
[51:53.080 --> 51:54.800]  I don't know if I'm going to be able to do better than that.
[51:54.900 --> 51:55.480]  Oh, push me away.
[51:55.580 --> 51:56.320]  I can't even get...
[51:56.320 --> 51:57.280]  That's even further away.
[51:58.620 --> 52:00.180]  Yeah, there you go.
[52:02.100 --> 52:02.480]  Okay.
[52:02.820 --> 52:03.840]  Now the chat gets it.
[52:03.920 --> 52:06.480]  They're saying, oh, this is a bit.
[52:06.920 --> 52:07.040]  Okay.
[52:07.280 --> 52:08.020]  Now, this is a bit.
[52:08.400 --> 52:11.040]  Before, when I was doing it, I was just having a bit.
[52:12.240 --> 52:15.980]  When I was doing it, I was just suffering from brain damage.
[52:17.560 --> 52:19.260]  Geoff, we're getting the Wii U controller again.
[52:20.660 --> 52:21.140]  All right.
[52:21.140 --> 52:22.060]  We've made progress.
[52:22.260 --> 52:24.640]  Now we just got to spin it back the other way.
[52:24.960 --> 52:26.540]  I'm going to let this guy help me do that.
[52:26.600 --> 52:26.960]  Watch this.
[52:27.020 --> 52:27.900]  He's going to spin it.
[52:28.860 --> 52:29.220]  Boom.
[52:29.400 --> 52:29.980]  Oh, he didn't.
[52:30.140 --> 52:31.100]  He really didn't, though.
[52:31.260 --> 52:31.720]  You're close.
[52:31.920 --> 52:33.020]  I would have thought he had.
[52:33.160 --> 52:34.200]  Push against me.
[52:34.840 --> 52:35.240]  All right.
[52:35.240 --> 52:36.340]  I'm pushing against Andrew.
[52:37.440 --> 52:37.800]  Whoa.
[52:38.060 --> 52:40.060]  Oh, he pushed me out of position.
[52:41.840 --> 52:43.140]  I didn't know you could even do that.
[52:43.180 --> 52:44.460]  What the hell happened?
[52:47.480 --> 52:48.920]  Geoff, for Christ's sake.
[52:48.920 --> 52:50.060]  Could you always do that?
[52:50.100 --> 52:51.020]  That doesn't make any sense.
[52:51.300 --> 52:52.320]  You shifted me.
[52:54.140 --> 52:56.400]  Oh, Andrew's out of position now.
[52:56.460 --> 52:57.140]  I'm sorry.
[52:57.220 --> 52:57.980]  I can't breathe.
[52:58.660 --> 53:00.560]  He just killed us all.
[53:00.960 --> 53:02.380]  Sit the god damn down.
[53:07.320 --> 53:08.660]  Oh, fuck this.
[53:08.760 --> 53:09.420]  I'm going around.
[53:11.200 --> 53:12.360]  He got it.
[53:12.420 --> 53:13.120]  Just get up there.
[53:13.300 --> 53:13.680]  Oh, okay.
[53:13.840 --> 53:14.040]  Nice.
[53:14.080 --> 53:14.220]  Nice.
[53:14.320 --> 53:14.440]  Nice.
[53:16.340 --> 53:18.440]  Oh, how did that happen?
[53:18.920 --> 53:20.980]  Oh, you're back there.
[53:22.420 --> 53:23.380]  Jesus Christ.
[53:24.520 --> 53:25.440]  Holy shit.
[53:25.460 --> 53:26.000]  All right, everyone.
[53:26.240 --> 53:27.000]  Geoff for MVP.
[53:29.140 --> 53:29.960]  Frickin' hell.
[53:33.280 --> 53:35.200]  Yeah, MVP Geoff.
[53:35.900 --> 53:36.880]  Where's my MP5?
[53:39.740 --> 53:41.300]  Oh, god damn.
[53:41.720 --> 53:42.060]  Fuck.
[53:44.100 --> 53:45.660]  Oh, I don't even have 100 coins.
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.120]  Hey, guys, that was...
[53:47.120 --> 53:47.680]  That's a lot of fun.
[53:47.760 --> 53:48.620]  Thanks for letting me play.
[53:50.580 --> 53:52.020]  I had a real good time doing that.
[53:52.060 --> 53:53.520]  We have at least one left.
[53:55.200 --> 53:57.100]  Based on how it went, it might just be one.
[53:58.100 --> 53:59.120]  Oh, give us some quarry.
[54:00.740 --> 54:01.460]  Oh, damn.
[54:02.660 --> 54:06.000]  What do we do in our sub-a-thon where we lock Gavin in a bedroom with Nick?
[54:08.160 --> 54:09.740]  They can finally make their show.
[54:09.880 --> 54:10.580]  Their fabled show.
[54:11.520 --> 54:14.060]  That's the door we don't go in.
[54:15.260 --> 54:16.800]  That's where their show happens.
[54:16.960 --> 54:18.000]  We can't go in there.
[54:18.040 --> 54:18.800]  It's not our show.
[54:18.800 --> 54:23.320]  Yeah, I guess every donation is like a minute that we have to play last over there.
[54:24.780 --> 54:25.500]  Oh, man.
[54:27.760 --> 54:30.380]  Gavin, Nick, and just a room filled with blood bombs.
[54:32.840 --> 54:33.540]  Let's see.
[54:33.740 --> 54:35.880]  How big is the blood bomb allowed to be?
[54:36.500 --> 54:37.700]  It's got to be... it has to be small.
[54:37.780 --> 54:38.780]  It has to be like a water balloon, right?
[54:39.160 --> 54:39.460]  Yeah.
[54:39.560 --> 54:40.060]  Okay, well...
[54:40.860 --> 54:41.840]  I'm the top, I think.
[54:42.840 --> 54:44.500]  Are we not going to get the coins or what?
[54:44.700 --> 54:45.980]  I would love if they got them.
[54:45.980 --> 54:46.440]  Yeah, I can get the coins.
[54:47.000 --> 54:47.520]  I can get the coins.
[54:48.160 --> 54:49.040]  I can't reach.
[54:49.600 --> 54:50.840]  Well, you twatted me there, so...
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.240]  Oh, did I?
[54:54.320 --> 54:55.540]  Hell yeah, tell him, Geoff!
[54:56.880 --> 54:58.020]  Fucking tell him, Geoff!
[54:58.260 --> 54:59.040]  I just did!
[54:59.440 --> 55:00.660]  That's what I'm saying, baby.
[55:00.840 --> 55:02.280]  All right, come over here and grab that one, Gavin.
[55:03.140 --> 55:04.200]  Oh, you pushed me into it.
[55:04.220 --> 55:04.620]  Nice job.
[55:04.800 --> 55:06.120]  All right, so now I'm going to be the top.
[55:06.560 --> 55:06.820]  Okay.
[55:07.060 --> 55:07.600]  Oh, you know what?
[55:07.680 --> 55:10.120]  I'll bet I can get the...
[55:10.120 --> 55:11.280]  Yeah, let's see what you do.
[55:15.220 --> 55:16.400]  I was going to do this.
[55:16.400 --> 55:18.120]  Yeah, there you go.
[55:18.260 --> 55:18.860]  Come on.
[55:18.960 --> 55:19.100]  Okay.
[55:19.840 --> 55:20.240]  Okay.
[55:20.620 --> 55:21.360]  There you go.
[55:22.200 --> 55:22.700]  Come on.
[55:23.120 --> 55:24.280]  Yep, there you go.
[55:24.800 --> 55:27.820]  And then Andrew... or who is that?
[55:28.680 --> 55:29.660]  Gavin, there you go.
[55:30.420 --> 55:30.900]  How am I...
[55:31.720 --> 55:32.600]  Oh, wait.
[55:32.840 --> 55:33.660]  Gavin needs to move.
[55:33.920 --> 55:34.140]  Wait.
[55:34.960 --> 55:35.600]  Am I in the wrong spot?
[55:36.400 --> 55:37.520]  Now you go back.
[55:37.560 --> 55:38.540]  He's got a lot of room for him.
[55:39.360 --> 55:40.580]  And now, Geoff, go up there.
[55:40.680 --> 55:41.780]  All right, I'll do my spot.
[55:42.620 --> 55:43.480]  And then we're good.
[55:43.700 --> 55:45.160]  And I will follow soon.
[55:45.180 --> 55:46.200]  Easy peasy, just like that.
[55:46.200 --> 55:49.360]  And we're getting closer to 5.01 by the minute.
[55:49.780 --> 55:50.080]  Oh my god.
[55:50.180 --> 55:51.580]  Wow, that was way faster than the last one.
[55:51.580 --> 55:52.920]  I want another hockey redemption.
[55:55.360 --> 55:57.140]  Yes, take us back to the hockey land.
[56:00.380 --> 56:02.480]  I want to see what the other level's game is.
[56:02.560 --> 56:03.080]  I have no idea.
[56:03.320 --> 56:04.100]  I've never played that one.
[56:04.620 --> 56:06.000]  I know the easy level is soccer.
[56:09.400 --> 56:10.220]  Second is hockey.
[56:10.560 --> 56:11.180]  I bet it's football.
[56:12.040 --> 56:13.240]  Oh, football would be fun.
[56:13.660 --> 56:14.660]  Football would be fun.
[56:15.460 --> 56:15.900]  Netball.
[56:16.200 --> 56:17.220]  Maybe it'd be UFC.
[56:17.560 --> 56:18.240]  That'd be cool.
[56:18.380 --> 56:19.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it'd be UFC.
[56:21.020 --> 56:24.080]  What was hidden in this game was the best UFC game that was ever made.
[56:24.340 --> 56:25.000]  Oh, man.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  Do you have to fight, but it's to this music?
[56:27.820 --> 56:28.840]  Oh, Chatty Best Friend.
[56:29.940 --> 56:33.180]  I think games should be buried in other games a lot more.
[56:33.920 --> 56:34.560]  I agree.
[56:35.860 --> 56:39.420]  Like Crash Bandicoot in What's It Called 4.
[56:39.720 --> 56:40.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:40.500 --> 56:42.080]  Just like Crash Bandicoot in What's It Called 4.
[56:42.760 --> 56:43.020]  Yeah.
[56:44.340 --> 56:44.840]  Tomb Raider.
[56:44.960 --> 56:45.480]  No, the other one.
[56:46.600 --> 56:47.320]  Indiana Jones.
[56:47.320 --> 56:47.780]  The other one.
[56:47.940 --> 56:48.520]  Uncharted 4.
[56:48.760 --> 56:49.720]  Indiana Jones.
[56:49.980 --> 56:51.620]  What, you can play all of Crash Bandicoot in it?
[56:52.140 --> 56:52.800]  I got no shades.
[56:54.380 --> 56:58.260]  Just like you can play games in GTA if you go to the bowling alley, right?
[57:02.210 --> 57:04.350]  Gears of War had one of those in Gears 3, I think.
[57:06.010 --> 57:07.250]  Like a chicken game you could play.
[57:08.390 --> 57:14.210]  I think you could play through all of the original Wolfenstein in the new Wolfenstein.
[57:14.470 --> 57:15.270]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:15.270 --> 57:17.970]  I'm more of a Crash Team Racing guy, but that's just me, you know?
[57:19.350 --> 57:26.030]  I heard there's the new box set that's going to be coming out from Rooster Teeth.
[57:26.290 --> 57:30.650]  It's going to have an easter egg track on it that has every video ever made by Rooster Teeth on it.
[57:30.790 --> 57:31.150]  Wow.
[57:31.630 --> 57:34.170]  Yeah, so you can get that and then you'll be able to see the entire collection.
[57:35.130 --> 57:36.390]  It'll be at 24p.
[57:43.040 --> 57:43.940]  There you go.
[57:44.120 --> 57:44.720]  I mean, I'm no.
[57:47.380 --> 57:49.860]  I'm no detective, but I mean, it feels right.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.080]  All right, Geoff, where do you think you lock in here?
[57:56.280 --> 57:58.440]  Oh, it looks like it's just down to old Geoff here.
[57:59.600 --> 58:00.680]  Probably go right there.
[58:00.900 --> 58:01.420]  Does that look good?
[58:01.600 --> 58:02.440]  I think that's it.
[58:06.740 --> 58:08.200]  Well, that's not going to work.
[58:08.720 --> 58:09.080]  Nope.
[58:09.320 --> 58:09.540]  Nope.
[58:09.540 --> 58:10.060]  That is wrong.
[58:10.160 --> 58:10.580]  You're close.
[58:10.760 --> 58:12.780]  So I think you need to go where I was.
[58:14.220 --> 58:14.520]  What do you?
[58:15.220 --> 58:16.020]  I think he was.
[58:16.020 --> 58:17.240]  I think he was fine.
[58:17.320 --> 58:17.900]  He just had to.
[58:18.580 --> 58:18.640]  Okay.
[58:18.960 --> 58:19.460]  Turning up.
[58:19.500 --> 58:20.900]  So turning around wouldn't have done it for me.
[58:21.540 --> 58:24.260]  Right, because he's only got the thing in one spot.
[58:24.420 --> 58:25.000]  Yeah, it'd be off.
[58:25.560 --> 58:26.260]  Oh, I see.
[58:26.960 --> 58:27.220]  Yeah.
[58:28.740 --> 58:30.340]  Where are you going, Andrew?
[58:30.360 --> 58:31.040]  I don't know.
[58:32.600 --> 58:33.560]  Then why did you?
[58:33.660 --> 58:34.840]  Then why did you kick me off?
[58:35.140 --> 58:36.440]  Then why did you kick me off?
[58:37.260 --> 58:38.380]  It kicked you off.
[58:38.660 --> 58:39.920]  And it kicked me in the air.
[58:40.020 --> 58:42.540]  And I tried to move for some reason.
[58:43.380 --> 58:44.280]  Oh, you go.
[58:44.420 --> 58:44.900]  You go there.
[58:44.980 --> 58:45.420]  Yeah, that's it.
[58:45.440 --> 58:45.900]  No, no, no, no.
[58:45.900 --> 58:48.680]  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[58:48.900 --> 58:49.200]  He knows.
[58:49.760 --> 58:50.400]  He knows.
[58:50.880 --> 58:52.140]  What do you, what do you, what do you?
[58:53.300 --> 58:54.440]  I was just trying to turn around.
[58:54.780 --> 58:55.640]  Why did you do that?
[58:56.940 --> 58:58.060]  Geoff and I are just asleep.
[58:58.200 --> 58:59.260]  We don't care about what's going on.
[58:59.260 --> 59:01.980]  Because I need to go like nightly anti-clockwise.
[59:03.040 --> 59:03.940]  Okay, why didn't you wait until yesterday?
[59:04.980 --> 59:05.800]  I'm against it.
[59:06.240 --> 59:07.260]  I can't stand that.
[59:07.320 --> 59:07.920]  I don't like it.
[59:08.060 --> 59:10.560]  Geoff, do you typically feel pro or anti-clockwise?
[59:10.720 --> 59:11.680]  I'm anti-clockwise.
[59:12.280 --> 59:13.260]  I'm on record.
[59:14.020 --> 59:15.540]  I went to a protest.
[59:15.960 --> 59:16.620]  There you go.
[59:17.260 --> 59:19.120]  That's what you're talking about.
[59:20.260 --> 59:24.560]  Well, if you kept touching me, I'm talking about that anti-clockwise scene.
[59:24.740 --> 59:25.040]  Easy.
[59:25.640 --> 59:28.600]  A lot of people, especially around the south, are pro-clockwise.
[59:29.180 --> 59:31.140]  And I'm sorry, but I just can't get on board with that.
[59:31.240 --> 59:32.660]  That's just not how I was raised.
[59:32.840 --> 59:35.900]  It's not the values my mom instilled in me.
[59:36.240 --> 59:36.960]  Here's the thing.
[59:37.060 --> 59:38.940]  Honestly, a guy like me, I'm pro-clockwise.
[59:39.980 --> 59:40.860]  Are you fucking serious?
[59:40.860 --> 59:41.600]  Yeah, man.
[59:41.620 --> 59:43.240]  I'm just saying, you know, that's something about me.
[59:43.240 --> 59:45.620]  I wish I'd have known this before we started a fucking company together.
[59:48.760 --> 59:49.940]  Did you go to a protest?
[59:50.080 --> 59:51.100]  I went to an anti-test.
[59:51.940 --> 59:52.300]  Fuck.
[59:53.300 --> 59:53.660]  Wow.
[59:54.980 --> 59:55.280]  Counter?
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.120]  What?
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.680]  My kitchen counter doesn't even rotate.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:24.640]  This is a stupid company.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:30.500]  This is the first company to be officially recognized by two country governments.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.300]  Hey, Delta Chang is right.
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.940]  You guys are anti-fessionals.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.160]  Shit.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.660]  No, no, we're counter-fessional.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.640]  Everybody knows that.
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.120]  Counter-fessionals.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.120]  All right, y'all lunatics, get out of the way.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.180]  We are 30 seconds away.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.580]  30 seconds away from the best time of the week.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.240]  It's five o'clock right now.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.760]  We are so close to 5.01.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.460]  Get ready to lock in for the best time of the week.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.200]  Geoff is locked in at the top with his sunglasses and he's ready to go.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.420]  No.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.940]  It was, it was...
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:13.980]  Andrew, what are you...
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.160]  I'm just giving you some hugs.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:16.900]  I'm giving you some hugs.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.300]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.680]  Giving him a hug.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.660]  I'm getting a little spoon from every direction.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.340]  Right at 5.01.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.780]  The best time of the week, guys.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.260]  Welcome to the best time of the week.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:28.660]  Thank you.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.080]  What do you think you're doing, Andrew?
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.880]  Could you do a little spoon spit roast?
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.160]  It's making new shape.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.260]  What the goddamn are you idiots on the wrong ones for?
[01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:49.510]  You're the goddamn opposite of each other.
[01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:51.130]  Ah, you're spitting at me.
[01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.070]  I'm gonna piss my pants, dude.
[01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:59.210]  Stop spitting at me, you fucking moron.
[01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.810]  That's not, we're in the wrong place.
[01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:03.230]  You know what?
[01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:04.810]  You know this can't work, right?
[01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.290]  No, you fool.
[01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:10.710]  They're the same direction.
[01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:11.890]  Their shape's the same.
[01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:12.950]  Yes, Mrs.
[01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:14.390]  Pete has done it wrong.
[01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.550]  Wait, how is their direction?
[01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:17.590]  How is theirs different?
[01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:22.010]  Is it really wrong?
[01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:25.430]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:27.010]  Are you sure?
[01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.810]  They're the opposite of each other.
[01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:30.870]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:34.310]  They're not the same piece.
[01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.150]  All right, let's go back.
[01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.250]  All right, let's go back.
[01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:43.130]  Get in place, little assholes.
[01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:47.450]  5.02, the best time of the week.
[01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:48.710]  All right, good luck, guys.
[01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:49.370]  Figure it out.
[01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:51.870]  I see what you're saying.
[01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:53.250]  Like, because the piece that...
[01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.330]  Right, because it doesn't...
[01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:55.730]  The piece that's down is the same piece.
[01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:56.590]  No, no, Gavin's got it.
[01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:57.330]  Gavin's got it.
[01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:58.770]  He's just gonna tell you where to go.
[01:02:59.050 --> 01:02:59.510]  Gavin's got it, guys.
[01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:00.530]  Gavin's locked in.
[01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.950]  Gavin's locked in.
[01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:03.710]  I don't know what your problem is, guys.
[01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.950]  All right, guys, we got two and a half minutes
[01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.050]  to tell them how to do it.
[01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:10.070]  So, if I'm...
[01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:16.890]  So, if I'm...
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:23.070]  Oh, why don't you go down there?
[01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:25.690]  Why is Geoff in that spot?
[01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.990]  I'm just not trying to...
[01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.970]  So, should I be...
[01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:32.530]  I think I need to be on the left side.
[01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:33.430]  I need to be on the left side.
[01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:35.450]  It's the only spot that works.
[01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:37.070]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:39.790]  Oh, God.
[01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:40.870]  Oh.
[01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:46.670]  Five out of three.
[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.450]  The best time of the week, guys.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.660]  Make sure that...
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.700]  Geoff can't get through us now.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.440]  Geoff has to go in there.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.340]  It's fucking yellow down there.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.600]  I'm trying.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.580]  Gavin, move for you to come back up, Geoff.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.300]  Shut up.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:06.960]  Oh, I'm twatted.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.020]  Aren't we all?
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.560]  Now, where are you going?
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.940]  What are you doing?
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.900]  I think I need to go...
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:14.700]  Oops, I think I...
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.580]  Guys, we have a minute 20 left.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.660]  I think I need to go here.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.540]  Are we gonna...
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:19.160]  Is this gonna be a failure?
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.760]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:21.720]  Yes.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.460]  So...
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.140]  Gavin wasn't right originally, chat.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.380]  What a way to end it.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.220]  We've done it.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:29.600]  It was close.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.000]  Easy peasy.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.000]  Boys, we did it.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.540]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.640]  We appreciate you so much.
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.720]  That was a lot of fun.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.540]  That was a good, uh...
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.040]  The first way also would have worked.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.600]  Is that true?
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.320]  No, it wasn't.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.300]  No, absolutely not.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.900]  Well, I'll take that with, uh...
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.280]  You stared at it.
[01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:00.390]  And please end this.
[01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:01.030]  You just end it.
[01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:01.510]  You end it.
[01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:02.470]  Okay, all right.
[01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:02.590]  Bye.
[01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.850]  Thanks for watching.
[01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:06.870]  What a great stream.
[01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:07.390]  We'll see you next time.
[01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.550]  We sure enjoyed hanging out with you guys.
[01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:11.790]  We'll see you next time when we do this again.
[01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:13.810]  Bye.
[01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:16.110]  Oh, hang out next week.
[01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:17.710]  Buy our shit.
[01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:19.210]  Oh, the guh, the guh.
[01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:20.170]  The GURPLERS.
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:21.110]  Embarrassing.
[01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:26.710]  And if you're listening to this on Tuesday, on Friday, it'll be available at noon central.
[01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.450]  And we'll be live streaming Mario Party.
[01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:29.690]  Bye.
[01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:32.170]  What will be available and where?
[01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.970]  Well, there you go.
[01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:35.750]  Take it away, Geoff.
[01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:36.530]  Oh my god.
[01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:38.170]  I'll tell you what's gonna be available.
[01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.570]  The GURPLER.
[01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:42.550]  The GURPLETINES Day GURPLER.
[01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:47.870]  It's a special GURPLETINE edition that is in no way different than the previous edition we sold
[01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:49.530]  at the end of last year.
[01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:51.750]  It is identical in every single way.
[01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:55.050]  That makes it a special GURPLETINE edition.
[01:05:55.510 --> 01:06:01.570]  Also, we're gonna have no scrumping and protected by falcon signs for sale next Friday on GURPLETINES
[01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:04.230]  Day to celebrate the GURP as you do.
[01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:05.210]  That's right.
[01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:11.910]  The original signs that everyone clamored for back in the old days and it couldn't get them fast
[01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:12.090]  enough.
[01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:13.410]  Now you'll have an opportunity again.
[01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.570]  And I think we restocked our dumb shirt.
[01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:18.210]  So if you want to buy a regulation shirt, you can get that as well.
[01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:23.030]  But even if you don't want to spend any money on us, we get that.
[01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:24.650]  Spend some eyeball time.
[01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:31.170]  Spend some earhole time and hang out and watch us play Mario Party for a few hours on our Twitch
[01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:33.050]  channel, which is this Twitch channel.
[01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:36.190]  So if you don't know what this Twitch channel is, look at your search bar.
[01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:37.550]  It's probably right there in front of you.
[01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:38.030]  Okay.
[01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:42.950]  Let us know if you think we'll play the whole game or whether one of us will get disconnected.
[01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:44.250]  Won't be Geoff.
[01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:48.210]  And also let us know who will get disconnected and if it will be Geoff.
[01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:52.490]  Andrew, are you okay?
[01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:56.190]  Buy a thing or don't whatever.
[01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.830]  All right.
[01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:57.510]  We'll see you later.
[01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.870]  Bye.
[01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:00.030]  Andrew's eating GTA.
