[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  See, they don't know what to do, Gavin.
[00:02.280 --> 00:04.960]  Oh no, Gavin! You flipped me!
[00:05.200 --> 00:06.200]  Gavin, you flipped me!
[00:06.300 --> 00:07.280]  I think we know what to do now.
[00:07.360 --> 00:08.840]  Gavin, you flipped me!
[00:08.920 --> 00:10.700]  It's okay, Gavin's focused on me, we're good.
[00:10.860 --> 00:11.460]  How do we change weapons?
[00:11.460 --> 00:13.560]  Gavin's not allowed to be on this team anymore!
[00:13.940 --> 00:15.840]  You can't get over?
[00:16.080 --> 00:16.340]  No!
[00:17.520 --> 00:19.020]  Why don't you try driving forwards?
[00:20.300 --> 00:21.100]  I'm trying!
[00:21.560 --> 00:23.580]  There you are, you were driving in reverse the whole way.
[00:23.620 --> 00:24.640]  I was going back!
[00:24.900 --> 00:25.680]  Oh my god.
[00:25.980 --> 00:26.380]  What?!
[00:28.380 --> 00:29.180]  Jesus Christ.
[00:29.180 --> 00:29.900]  Gavin.
[00:30.980 --> 00:31.420]  Gavin.
[00:31.720 --> 00:32.740]  Okay, I'm up.
[00:33.520 --> 00:35.060]  Gavin, you were driving over me!
[00:35.840 --> 00:37.280]  You flipped me immediately!
[00:37.700 --> 00:39.020]  What do you mean, no Gavin, you?
[00:39.220 --> 00:40.280]  You drove backwards!
[00:40.620 --> 00:41.380]  Who cares?
[00:42.220 --> 00:44.140]  Was the problem I drove backwards?
[00:44.520 --> 00:44.680]  Yeah.
[00:44.900 --> 00:45.140]  No!
[00:45.540 --> 00:48.040]  The problem was I was on my side!
[00:48.340 --> 00:49.140]  Did you end up flipped?
[00:49.500 --> 00:50.680]  What are you talking about?
[00:50.820 --> 00:51.500]  You ended up flipped!
[00:51.740 --> 00:53.720]  If you get stabbed in a different state,
[00:53.800 --> 00:56.380]  you're not at fault for buying a plane ticket to get there.
[00:56.660 --> 00:57.580]  What do you mean?
