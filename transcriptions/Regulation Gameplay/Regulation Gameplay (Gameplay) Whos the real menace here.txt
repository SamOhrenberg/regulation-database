[00:00.000 --> 00:02.180]  Is this you or is this your trailer?
[00:02.680 --> 00:04.260]  It's both of us. We're we're attached.
[00:04.660 --> 00:08.220]  OK. Oh, well, great. Great.
[00:08.900 --> 00:11.780]  I appreciate you trying to fix things next time.
[00:11.900 --> 00:14.060]  Just I think you just need to go to Smithville Dam, bud.
[00:14.200 --> 00:15.300]  So what do you do?
[00:15.660 --> 00:16.940]  Oh, it's just I'm not tracking it right.
[00:17.020 --> 00:19.580]  I didn't if we didn't have to go back up here,
[00:19.580 --> 00:23.280]  I could have just used the crane and loaded you up.
[00:23.400 --> 00:25.880]  You went backwards up the hill.
[00:26.120 --> 00:29.580]  And now he's and put yourself in such a worse position
[00:29.580 --> 00:30.440]  than where you left.
[00:30.600 --> 00:32.900]  Hey, Andrew, Geoff can't see what what you're doing.
[00:32.980 --> 00:35.320]  Do you want to you want to catch him up on how you're doing with?
[00:36.060 --> 00:37.640]  Well, Nick fell over.
[00:37.760 --> 00:40.960]  He tipped his truck, lost his beams, but the beams are still intact.
[00:40.960 --> 00:43.120]  So they're going to be retrievable.
[00:43.320 --> 00:43.680]  That's awesome.
[00:43.800 --> 00:46.560]  So I got a crane and then Nick was all good when I left.
[00:46.680 --> 00:50.580]  And then I came back about five minutes later and Nick was on his side
[00:50.580 --> 00:54.180]  further up the mountain going opposite of where he needs to go.
[00:54.260 --> 00:57.580]  And I kind of tipped over trying to trying to help him
[00:57.580 --> 00:59.520]  because it is a bad road.
