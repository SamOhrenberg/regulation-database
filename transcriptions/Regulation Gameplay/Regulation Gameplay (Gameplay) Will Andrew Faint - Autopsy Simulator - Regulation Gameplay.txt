[00:00.000 --> 00:01.580]  Are you nervous about this at all?
[00:02.100 --> 00:02.560]  A little bit.
[00:03.300 --> 00:06.280]  Just very curious about what's about to happen.
[00:07.400 --> 00:10.640]  Hello and welcome to a regulation gameplay
[00:10.640 --> 00:12.600]  in which we're playing autopsy simulator.
[00:12.760 --> 00:14.120]  Now we're doing this
[00:15.020 --> 00:16.300]  because I might pass out.
[00:16.580 --> 00:20.260]  I have a weird thing where surgery,
[00:20.400 --> 00:24.320]  like realistic surgery stuff, really gets me for some reason.
[00:24.720 --> 00:26.600]  I get the sweats.
[00:26.800 --> 00:28.340]  I get ringing in my ears.
[00:28.340 --> 00:32.140]  And then it leads to fainting, which I've never fully done.
[00:33.120 --> 00:35.140]  But I've gotten close a few times.
[00:35.500 --> 00:37.240]  I cannot believe this was your suggestion.
[00:37.460 --> 00:38.940]  Yeah, so here's my suggestion.
[00:39.240 --> 00:40.400]  Well, I want to lay this out.
[00:40.500 --> 00:41.880]  I want to lay this out for the audience.
[00:42.400 --> 00:43.220]  We gave Andrew.
[00:43.300 --> 00:46.860]  Andrew pitched this to us and we were both like,
[00:47.840 --> 00:50.720]  um, you don't have to do this.
[00:50.820 --> 00:51.720]  And he was like, no, no, no, no.
[00:51.740 --> 00:52.920]  I think this is a good idea. Let's do it.
[00:52.920 --> 00:53.540]  I think it'll be funny.
[00:53.780 --> 00:56.540]  Then I started getting into it and I thought maybe we could put little
[00:56.540 --> 00:59.840]  buzzes all over his desk to hear his head hit the table.
[00:59.980 --> 01:01.440]  But then, you know, we're just going to keep it simple.
[01:02.100 --> 01:06.780]  So so if you're if you're upset that we're doing something like this, it's OK.
[01:06.900 --> 01:08.080]  You don't have to watch the video.
[01:08.220 --> 01:09.220]  I totally understand.
[01:09.400 --> 01:13.800]  But just know we gave Andrew every out to not do his idea.
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.940]  Yes. Just want to be clear.
[01:15.980 --> 01:19.500]  I've looked at the screenshots for this game and it has made me uncomfortable.
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.700]  And you'll let us know if you're feeling the symptoms.
[01:22.800 --> 01:24.080]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'll keep you updated.
[01:25.560 --> 01:27.040]  I don't know if this game even has this.
[01:27.160 --> 01:30.860]  I don't know anything about I've avoided information outside of I know it is.
[01:31.480 --> 01:33.340]  I mean, I'm not I'm not great with this stuff.
[01:33.480 --> 01:35.800]  I used to when I was learning how to edit as a young man,
[01:35.920 --> 01:38.520]  I used to edit medical videos for a production company.
[01:38.580 --> 01:39.480]  Oh, I had to.
[01:39.700 --> 01:42.920]  I had to like keep the opacity like 20 percent below.
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.900]  No, please don't call me again and stop inquiring about my wife.
[01:48.960 --> 01:50.320]  Stop telling me about my wife.
[01:50.360 --> 01:51.520]  I don't want to hear about my wife.
[01:51.520 --> 01:53.660]  Journalists, they don't let me work.
[01:54.040 --> 01:55.740]  Oh, wow. Lots of it.
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.280]  That like grainy noise effect.
[01:58.540 --> 02:00.100]  Team 17 game. Makers of Worms.
[02:00.200 --> 02:00.980]  Love Team 17.
[02:01.780 --> 02:04.380]  Thanks, Team 17, for making Andrew pass out, maybe.
[02:06.020 --> 02:07.100]  Well, this is fine.
[02:07.520 --> 02:10.760]  Oh, OK. I thought you thought it makes sense.
[02:10.800 --> 02:12.320]  There'd be some actual story.
[02:12.360 --> 02:14.900]  You thought that we would just get right into cutting somebody open.
[02:15.060 --> 02:16.780]  Yeah. Didn't clean up after himself.
[02:17.740 --> 02:19.820]  Well, if it helps, you can probably skip all this.
[02:19.820 --> 02:21.880]  OK. Probably could.
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.720]  But then I wouldn't get the achievement.
[02:24.500 --> 02:25.740]  Is that the concern?
[02:25.900 --> 02:27.440]  That's my wife. OK.
[02:28.060 --> 02:29.320]  Stop calling about her.
[02:29.660 --> 02:31.040]  I just slammed the phone about her.
[02:31.720 --> 02:32.740]  Oh, can I drink?
[02:33.140 --> 02:35.020]  No, it would be good to finally repair.
[02:35.100 --> 02:36.760]  Yeah, I can turn it on off. That's good.
[02:37.220 --> 02:39.980]  Wednesday. It's some slight Trapang vibes.
[02:41.260 --> 02:43.200]  Let's let's get let's get going.
[02:45.260 --> 02:46.120]  Where are we headed?
[02:46.480 --> 02:47.960]  Check the bathroom for your pills.
[02:48.560 --> 02:51.640]  It's a bathroom after pills here.
[02:53.620 --> 02:58.180]  I think one day augmented reality will just outline stuff for us.
[02:58.900 --> 03:00.840]  You know what? I don't have a problem with that.
[03:00.880 --> 03:02.860]  When everyone complains in video games about like, oh,
[03:02.940 --> 03:05.720]  like the ledges are yellow and it makes it too easy.
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.100]  It's like I'm not trying to fail the part where I'm climbing the mountain.
[03:09.300 --> 03:11.480]  I don't even want to play the part where I'm climbing the mountain.
[03:11.740 --> 03:13.620]  I think that's the worst part of a video game.
[03:13.820 --> 03:14.940]  So like, yeah, that's fine.
[03:14.940 --> 03:20.000]  I'll take yellow stained ledges over jumping into an invisible wall six times.
[03:20.340 --> 03:20.780]  Yep.
[03:22.400 --> 03:23.220]  Oh, God.
[03:23.400 --> 03:26.100]  Also, I sit on the tripod in the dissecting room.
[03:26.540 --> 03:30.380]  When I'm when I'm playing video games, I'm just looking to play video games.
[03:30.460 --> 03:32.660]  I'm not looking to like master them.
[03:32.720 --> 03:34.380]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[03:35.300 --> 03:37.840]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[03:38.280 --> 03:39.800]  Do people come to life in this game or?
[03:40.080 --> 03:41.400]  Oh, they blurred the dick. Yeah.
[03:41.480 --> 03:42.580]  Oh, he's really that sick.
[03:42.860 --> 03:44.460]  And he's been gone a while. That one.
[03:44.460 --> 03:47.800]  Yeah, I put the camera down.
[03:48.260 --> 03:52.420]  Well, this is good because we have a guy who like gets faint about,
[03:52.560 --> 03:55.380]  you know, dead body stuff and surgery.
[03:55.620 --> 03:59.040]  And then we have a real expert in Gavin who used to like edit dead body video.
[03:59.280 --> 03:59.900]  It's pretty cool.
[04:00.140 --> 04:00.620]  No, I wasn't.
[04:01.500 --> 04:03.380]  The people were alive when I was there.
[04:03.740 --> 04:04.900]  Yeah, if you say so.
[04:05.060 --> 04:06.560]  I wasn't editing snuff films.
[04:06.920 --> 04:08.400]  Take a look at the chalkboard.
[04:08.800 --> 04:10.460]  OK, what are we doing?
[04:10.760 --> 04:11.160]  Hello, everyone.
[04:11.820 --> 04:13.140]  So you got glove up.
[04:13.140 --> 04:14.540]  Yeah, you got to go up, dude.
[04:14.700 --> 04:17.060]  That's a gloves disinfected part of it.
[04:17.100 --> 04:18.320]  I'm OK with this part.
[04:18.480 --> 04:19.580]  This part's fine.
[04:19.880 --> 04:21.560]  Cleanliness and it's next to godliness.
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.280]  Yeah, and it's true.
[04:23.380 --> 04:24.800]  Number two, do the autopsy.
[04:26.220 --> 04:28.460]  Step two, you cut them open.
[04:29.240 --> 04:31.100]  Do you think I'm fine with this part?
[04:31.160 --> 04:32.040]  OK, this part's great.
[04:32.220 --> 04:34.200]  OK, do you think that's step two, step three, bud?
[04:34.520 --> 04:35.160]  Documentation place.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.880]  Oh, step two.
[04:37.120 --> 04:38.620]  I don't. This is not good.
[04:39.460 --> 04:40.720]  I don't like this part.
[04:40.960 --> 04:41.700]  It's going to be a weird video.
[04:42.200 --> 04:43.220]  First, put on gloves.
[04:43.660 --> 04:45.220]  Third, write your findings.
[04:46.460 --> 04:48.800]  Then we'll contain all sorts of permanent information.
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.720]  Part two, take a look.
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.360]  Now, Andrew, is there a specific part of the body that you think is going to get you?
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.220]  All of it.
[04:56.880 --> 04:57.660]  Every part of it.
[04:57.680 --> 05:00.620]  I'm hoping that you learn a lot about the ribs and the placement of the ribs.
[05:00.620 --> 05:01.560]  I was just about to say the same thing.
[05:01.640 --> 05:03.680]  I'm so excited for you to learn where the ribs are, man.
[05:04.020 --> 05:08.400]  Cut open like his like middle, like where his stomach is.
[05:08.460 --> 05:09.620]  And you go, there's no ribs here.
[05:09.680 --> 05:10.320]  And you go, right.
[05:10.980 --> 05:12.560]  Oh, shit. This is where he was found.
[05:13.520 --> 05:14.680]  I guess so, yeah.
[05:14.760 --> 05:17.040]  He died with a food coupon in his bed.
[05:17.060 --> 05:18.440]  Tragic. A food coupon.
[05:18.560 --> 05:19.500]  He had plans later.
[05:23.280 --> 05:25.520]  Prepare for the finest protective gloves to wear.
[05:25.620 --> 05:26.480]  OK, I saw those.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.060]  Oh, boy. OK, I got my gloves on.
[05:32.180 --> 05:33.140]  Those puppies are on.
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.480]  Pick up the camera.
[05:36.960 --> 05:38.080]  Aha, there you are.
[05:38.160 --> 05:39.540]  Oh, all right.
[05:41.320 --> 05:42.600]  I don't think you picked it up, did you?
[05:43.140 --> 05:44.160]  I don't think I did.
[05:45.060 --> 05:46.620]  Open, open, give that a shot again.
[05:47.420 --> 05:47.800]  Here we go.
[05:52.070 --> 05:52.930]  Oh, OK.
[05:53.410 --> 05:54.650]  Now what I got to do?
[05:55.990 --> 05:57.530]  Gather photographic documentation.
[05:57.810 --> 05:58.710]  At the cadaver and the condition.
[05:58.710 --> 05:59.730]  OK, that's fine.
[05:59.770 --> 06:00.510]  I'm fine with this.
[06:00.590 --> 06:02.590]  OK, this is just like Dead Rising.
[06:02.890 --> 06:03.170]  That's fine.
[06:03.550 --> 06:05.470]  Yeah, but this is not going to take a picture.
[06:05.470 --> 06:06.330]  Let's keep going.
[06:06.510 --> 06:07.470]  It's all about the legibility.
[06:07.950 --> 06:08.310]  Fantastic.
[06:10.590 --> 06:11.810]  Oh, you can see pubes.
[06:12.050 --> 06:12.310]  Nice.
[06:12.650 --> 06:13.910]  They get the pubes in.
[06:15.710 --> 06:16.050]  How do I?
[06:18.470 --> 06:19.450]  House is not a general.
[06:19.570 --> 06:20.370]  Let me take the photo.
[06:20.630 --> 06:21.170]  Oh, there we go.
[06:22.090 --> 06:23.810]  You need to get more of his undercarriage.
[06:24.270 --> 06:24.870]  Take your time.
[06:25.670 --> 06:28.710]  Look, I got to find marks on the body to photograph.
[06:29.010 --> 06:29.670]  OK, OK.
[06:29.850 --> 06:30.430]  We got marks.
[06:30.510 --> 06:32.710]  We got that's a scuffed up knee right there.
[06:32.790 --> 06:33.050]  Yep.
[06:33.750 --> 06:37.250]  There was like a stab wound in his abdomen as well.
[06:37.330 --> 06:38.030]  A stabdomen?
[06:38.790 --> 06:39.190]  Stabdomen.
[06:39.490 --> 06:40.170]  There you go.
[06:40.410 --> 06:42.550]  OK, so like what's old photos you look later?
[06:42.790 --> 06:43.710]  Photos one of four.
[06:43.890 --> 06:44.070]  OK.
[06:47.620 --> 06:48.520]  Where else you hurt?
[06:49.340 --> 06:50.440]  Where else you hurt?
[06:50.560 --> 06:50.980]  Not knees.
[06:51.040 --> 06:51.780]  You're not going to do the knees.
[06:52.140 --> 06:52.700]  Knees look good.
[06:52.820 --> 06:53.640]  Knees look all scraped up.
[06:54.220 --> 06:55.020]  It doesn't.
[06:55.120 --> 06:56.340]  You need to have that.
[06:56.760 --> 06:57.300]  Oh, dude.
[06:57.360 --> 06:57.720]  Frostbite.
[06:57.960 --> 06:58.120]  Let Nick know.
[06:58.240 --> 06:59.340]  Yeah, let Nick know about these feet.
[07:01.800 --> 07:02.780]  Oh, there we go.
[07:03.500 --> 07:04.620]  Frostbite on the old fingers.
[07:05.400 --> 07:06.780]  Oh, hardened hands.
[07:07.400 --> 07:07.880]  Headbanging?
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.200]  Oh no, he's headbanging.
[07:10.880 --> 07:12.140]  That's a bonk, I think.
[07:12.480 --> 07:13.340]  Mm hmm.
[07:13.440 --> 07:14.520]  That's a technical bonk.
[07:15.780 --> 07:17.400]  That's something interesting.
[07:17.720 --> 07:18.740]  Oh, it's a clear bonk.
[07:18.940 --> 07:21.320]  Check whether this injury was severe enough to in a moment.
[07:21.860 --> 07:23.600]  We will check with our initial observations.
[07:23.880 --> 07:26.900]  We'll pin photos to the photo board before we get to that.
[07:27.260 --> 07:29.180]  I need to write down some basic data.
[07:30.240 --> 07:31.300]  Oh, whoops.
[07:32.780 --> 07:34.120]  Let's click this.
[07:34.260 --> 07:36.440]  You're doing good at all, like the administrative stuff.
[07:36.540 --> 07:37.000]  That's pretty good.
[07:37.240 --> 07:38.800]  Oh, this is locked in.
[07:40.200 --> 07:40.980]  Oh, no.
[07:41.280 --> 07:43.640]  OK, perform the autopsy.
[07:43.660 --> 07:43.960]  All right.
[07:44.080 --> 07:44.780]  Step two, baby.
[07:45.320 --> 07:46.180]  Let's get to it.
[07:47.100 --> 07:48.040]  Personal information.
[07:48.360 --> 07:48.980]  OK, so.
[07:49.160 --> 07:49.940]  Oh, Tobias.
[07:50.440 --> 07:50.820]  No, no.
[07:51.440 --> 07:51.960]  62 male.
[07:52.500 --> 07:56.700]  OK, as you can see, I note everything down on previously prepared forms.
[07:57.140 --> 07:57.920]  I don't care.
[07:59.640 --> 08:01.580]  I care not for this dead man.
[08:01.580 --> 08:05.080]  Inspect the areas of concern with the magnifying glass.
[08:05.420 --> 08:08.300]  And I got some concern about some areas.
[08:11.140 --> 08:12.500]  But you have to you have to open your tools.
[08:14.340 --> 08:15.320]  Tools. Oh, yes.
[08:15.520 --> 08:17.100]  Thank you. Oh, God.
[08:17.220 --> 08:19.580]  OK, a magnifier.
[08:19.700 --> 08:20.780]  What do you think the syringe is for?
[08:21.340 --> 08:23.240]  I don't know, but we're going to go with the hand
[08:23.240 --> 08:24.960]  because it's the least bothersome to me.
[08:25.000 --> 08:26.960]  OK, by the characteristic skin color.
[08:28.040 --> 08:30.220]  OK, I'm just going to have to I'm just looking at everything.
[08:30.220 --> 08:31.620]  It's not like, hey, you're looking at this.
[08:31.720 --> 08:32.660]  Now, do something with it.
[08:32.800 --> 08:34.560]  No doubt. Let's go through.
[08:35.560 --> 08:38.780]  You're going to have to look at his bothersome head bonk.
[08:40.360 --> 08:43.700]  I can confirm the head bonk on the deceased man's head.
[08:43.920 --> 08:45.480]  Yeah. Camosis. That's what I was thinking.
[08:46.200 --> 08:48.700]  Looking at that and I was going, that's right there.
[08:49.140 --> 08:50.540]  Oh, this guy. Camosis.
[08:50.740 --> 08:52.700]  Definitely a painful mix of frostbite.
[08:52.860 --> 08:53.560]  That's a little much.
[08:53.900 --> 08:55.000]  It's just feet.
[08:56.700 --> 08:58.980]  Yeah, there are a lot of superficial wounds.
[08:59.580 --> 09:01.420]  This is going to gross me out, too, I think.
[09:01.640 --> 09:02.300]  I might be with you on this.
[09:02.460 --> 09:04.180]  Previously found wounds on the clipboard.
[09:04.980 --> 09:07.100]  If we find wet bread in his stomach, I'm out.
[09:09.440 --> 09:10.440]  Find the contents.
[09:11.340 --> 09:13.320]  Where is the clipboard?
[09:18.140 --> 09:19.960]  Where is any idea what?
[09:21.140 --> 09:21.440]  What do you?
[09:23.080 --> 09:25.880]  Highlight the previously found wounds on the clipboard mannequin.
[09:26.120 --> 09:27.120]  Well, where's the clipboard?
[09:28.320 --> 09:29.900]  I don't know. Where's the mannequin?
[09:30.500 --> 09:32.700]  Well, I think mannequin is the term for.
[09:34.380 --> 09:39.200]  Like. Just like the the body that's probably there, there you go.
[09:39.260 --> 09:40.340]  Clipboard, why the tool?
[09:40.480 --> 09:45.400]  No, it's clipboard. Why is there that you mark the wounds for each one?
[09:46.260 --> 09:51.300]  So the head, even the feet, his body was cold for a thing.
[09:51.320 --> 09:52.300]  His hand. Yeah.
[09:52.500 --> 09:54.440]  So you're doing great. OK.
[09:55.560 --> 09:58.400]  Let's write down what preliminary causes of death we can think.
[09:58.540 --> 09:59.620]  Cool. We're being thorough.
[09:59.620 --> 10:02.760]  I guess that's sort of the point of autopsy.
[10:02.900 --> 10:04.400]  You're not half asked to do autopsy.
[10:07.040 --> 10:07.460]  Highlight.
[10:07.960 --> 10:11.560]  Yeah, I feel like if Andrea had this job for a while,
[10:11.740 --> 10:15.100]  he would just lead in through the door, like not cross the threshold
[10:15.100 --> 10:17.580]  and maybe just put a lot of question marks on his clipboard.
[10:17.880 --> 10:21.540]  Yeah, definitely dead would be a lot of the notes.
[10:22.720 --> 10:24.760]  What's missing? I clicked all these, did I not?
[10:27.800 --> 10:30.440]  But down the. OK, we still have one thing left for the basics.
[10:30.620 --> 10:31.920]  How are you with dead bodies in real life?
[10:33.220 --> 10:34.840]  I what? I don't know.
[10:37.280 --> 10:38.420]  Perform the rigor mode.
[10:38.720 --> 10:40.280]  Oh, really good. Like, so good.
[10:40.620 --> 10:41.700]  Like, I actually prefer it.
[10:43.120 --> 10:44.440]  Wait, what is this?
[10:44.940 --> 10:45.840]  What am I doing here?
[10:45.960 --> 10:47.360]  It looks like a golf swing meter.
[10:48.180 --> 10:50.180]  Gradually we raise it for.
[10:50.640 --> 10:53.120]  Oh, my God. Oh.
[10:53.120 --> 10:55.900]  Oh, too much. Oh.
[11:00.680 --> 11:01.360]  He's waving.
[11:01.660 --> 11:03.120]  You want to keep it? You do it too much.
[11:03.200 --> 11:04.360]  You got to keep it in the bar.
[11:04.560 --> 11:06.760]  I got it. OK, OK. Slowly, slowly.
[11:06.900 --> 11:09.000]  So slowly and slowly. We're going down.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.080]  There you go. We're going down.
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.940]  Oh, it's like he's doing the wave thing.
[11:12.060 --> 11:13.620]  Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, careful.
[11:14.100 --> 11:17.480]  OK, as you can see, the hand falls loose.
[11:17.900 --> 11:19.520]  What did you learn about the rigor mortis?
[11:20.640 --> 11:21.820]  He's rigorous ago.
[11:24.140 --> 11:26.180]  The head trauma seems the brain examination.
[11:26.620 --> 11:30.400]  So, like, oh, this is it.
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.140]  This is where it gets.
[11:31.480 --> 11:35.460]  Might be it might be just like a short video.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.080]  Oh, God, it's a good job as well.
[11:43.820 --> 11:45.040]  Oh, my God.
[11:45.380 --> 11:47.080]  Oh, too much, too much.
[11:47.180 --> 11:49.160]  Oh, I don't just looking at the bar.
[11:49.280 --> 11:50.080]  I'm just looking at the bar.
[11:50.240 --> 11:51.400]  I'm not looking at anything else.
[11:51.980 --> 11:53.300]  We're just focusing on the bar.
[11:53.480 --> 11:55.800]  Oh, keep it balanced, keep it balanced, keep it balanced.
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.560]  Oh, my God. Oh, let's go.
[12:00.500 --> 12:01.740]  Oh, oh, no.
[12:02.640 --> 12:05.940]  All right. Begin a thorough examination of his brain after the basic exam.
[12:05.960 --> 12:06.680]  OK, this is just.
[12:07.040 --> 12:11.460]  Oh, it's so wiggly, I don't like it, it's so wiggly, it's so wiggly.
[12:14.600 --> 12:15.660]  It's like a headcrab.
[12:16.340 --> 12:17.520]  He just pulled the brain out.
[12:17.560 --> 12:19.400]  Oh, my God.
[12:19.400 --> 12:21.700]  For me, it's much more convenient.
[12:21.700 --> 12:22.360]  Where's the jaw?
[12:23.120 --> 12:26.440]  Oh, oh, oh, no.
[12:26.580 --> 12:27.980]  Oh, it's just a cutting board.
[12:28.860 --> 12:31.760]  Holding a long knife in the dominant hand.
[12:31.900 --> 12:33.240]  Oh, no.
[12:33.920 --> 12:36.140]  Go ahead. Oh, I'm getting tingles.
[12:36.360 --> 12:37.580]  I don't like it.
[12:37.960 --> 12:39.260]  I don't like it.
[12:39.460 --> 12:41.140]  Just picture it as like a nice steak.
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.380]  What am I? Oh.
[12:47.720 --> 12:48.620]  Oh, you butchered it.
[12:48.620 --> 12:49.880]  No, you did it.
[12:51.520 --> 12:53.760]  Oh, oh, oh, it's so squishy.
[12:53.980 --> 12:54.680]  Don't hit the sides.
[12:55.120 --> 12:58.420]  Nice. Oh, it is like a nice thing.
[12:58.500 --> 13:00.120]  It's like cauliflower, like a cauliflower steak.
[13:00.620 --> 13:02.220]  Yeah, it's just cauliflower, it's just cauliflower.
[13:03.320 --> 13:03.960]  It's just cauliflower.
[13:04.520 --> 13:06.540]  Oh, why am I dizzy in the game?
[13:06.880 --> 13:09.180]  Oh, no. Oh, this is AndrewVision.
[13:09.440 --> 13:10.160]  Wait, so wait.
[13:10.460 --> 13:12.680]  In the game, do you think you both have?
[13:13.260 --> 13:14.940]  You both have this feeling?
[13:16.160 --> 13:17.360]  Oh, you need your pills.
[13:18.500 --> 13:19.840]  Yeah, I don't have any sound on.
[13:20.200 --> 13:21.900]  Is he going like, ugh, ugh?
[13:25.140 --> 13:26.200]  You better find your pills.
[13:26.340 --> 13:27.520]  You got to return to the autopsy, dude.
[13:27.620 --> 13:28.060]  Oh, that's not my pills.
[13:28.200 --> 13:29.500]  I think your pills are at the autopsy.
[13:30.140 --> 13:30.820]  Why would they be?
[13:30.940 --> 13:32.180]  They were in the bathroom before.
[13:32.240 --> 13:33.560]  It says to return to the autopsy, doesn't it?
[13:34.140 --> 13:36.440]  OK, it does. You're right, but...
[13:36.440 --> 13:37.300]  Oh, boy. OK.
[13:38.820 --> 13:39.180]  Oh.
[13:40.540 --> 13:40.900]  Oh.
[13:43.660 --> 13:45.060]  No, no, I agree.
[13:47.140 --> 13:48.200]  Everything is spinning.
[13:50.060 --> 13:51.400]  He has to take pills.
[13:51.620 --> 13:53.220]  I think I've got to go back and take my pills.
[13:53.240 --> 13:54.040]  But you took them, didn't you?
[13:54.120 --> 13:54.820]  You took them with you.
[13:56.120 --> 13:57.280]  Are they not in your bag?
[13:57.680 --> 13:59.240]  Are they like in your inventory or something?
[14:00.720 --> 14:01.620]  Where's the bathroom?
[14:06.140 --> 14:07.040]  Oh, there you go.
[14:08.680 --> 14:09.020]  Wow.
[14:09.100 --> 14:09.700]  Maybe you just need to look.
[14:09.700 --> 14:10.900]  You need to get some of these pills, Andrew.
[14:12.380 --> 14:13.660]  On the gloves?
[14:14.200 --> 14:15.220]  On the brain gloves?
[14:16.260 --> 14:17.680]  That is crazy.
[14:19.140 --> 14:21.020]  Andrew, you need to get some of these pills, dude.
[14:23.180 --> 14:23.660]  OK.
[14:24.340 --> 14:26.500]  You've got a handful of frontal lobe in your mouth.
[14:29.200 --> 14:31.840]  We can rule the fatal accident out as well.
[14:33.480 --> 14:34.640]  The metrical brain.
[14:35.960 --> 14:37.860]  Exclude fall? How do we do that?
[14:39.100 --> 14:40.580]  How do we do this?
[14:40.980 --> 14:43.320]  There's like a cause of death.
[14:44.820 --> 14:46.160]  Oh, it's right there on the post-it.
[14:49.300 --> 14:50.860]  Did not affect the brain condition?
[14:52.140 --> 14:53.200]  I just click these?
[14:53.380 --> 14:54.440]  No, no, you don't know about that yet.
[14:56.180 --> 14:57.940]  I grab a scalpel from my kit.
[14:58.000 --> 14:58.480]  Scalpel time.
[14:59.280 --> 14:59.960]  And begin cutting.
[15:00.340 --> 15:01.340]  We've got to search for alcohol.
[15:02.800 --> 15:04.720]  The incision should be in the shape of a Y.
[15:05.420 --> 15:06.540]  Alright, give him a cut, Andrew.
[15:06.540 --> 15:08.600]  Don't look away. This is the only thing you can do.
[15:08.620 --> 15:09.380]  It's right there. Go ahead.
[15:10.620 --> 15:12.800]  I think I've got to close my eyes on this.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.940]  You can't close your eyes.
[15:15.020 --> 15:16.540]  You have to look at it.
[15:16.580 --> 15:18.400]  How else are you supposed to do this?
[15:19.780 --> 15:21.940]  Do I keep going down?
[15:22.420 --> 15:23.400]  I'm closing my eyes.
[15:24.340 --> 15:25.680]  No, no, no, no.
[15:26.500 --> 15:28.360]  You missed. You've got to go back, Andrew.
[15:29.800 --> 15:30.160]  Back?
[15:31.920 --> 15:32.800]  Too far.
[15:32.800 --> 15:35.460]  That's it? And back to where you were?
[15:35.700 --> 15:35.800]  No.
[15:37.140 --> 15:38.140]  Left or right?
[15:38.560 --> 15:39.440]  Top left.
[15:40.860 --> 15:41.860]  Little right.
[15:42.900 --> 15:43.460]  Up.
[15:45.640 --> 15:46.540]  There you go.
[15:46.720 --> 15:48.000]  I heard a cut noise.
[15:49.080 --> 15:50.520]  A lot easier.
[15:51.660 --> 15:52.420]  And now to the right.
[15:53.520 --> 15:54.720]  You're just scribbling.
[15:54.820 --> 15:56.380]  He's going in circles. Is that okay?
[15:56.740 --> 15:58.200]  Go left.
[15:59.020 --> 16:01.120]  Now from there, go directly right.
[16:01.120 --> 16:02.640]  No, too much.
[16:02.760 --> 16:03.520]  Go left.
[16:12.780 --> 16:14.520]  You missed at the chest.
[16:14.720 --> 16:15.240]  There you go.
[16:16.360 --> 16:19.460]  Now you've got to peel back and separate the skin, Andrew.
[16:23.700 --> 16:25.400]  I don't like it.
[16:26.420 --> 16:27.640]  I don't like it.
[16:28.160 --> 16:29.480]  Go ahead and peel back.
[16:31.220 --> 16:31.820]  Ah!
[16:34.950 --> 16:36.450]  Do the chest also.
[16:37.630 --> 16:39.070]  That's where the ribs are, Andrew.
[16:39.070 --> 16:41.270]  I hate that part. I don't like that part.
[16:41.350 --> 16:42.430]  Now you have to remove the ribs.
[16:43.970 --> 16:45.330]  Select the loppers
[16:45.330 --> 16:46.410]  and remove the ribs.
[16:47.710 --> 16:48.310]  Loppers?
[16:49.230 --> 16:49.270]  Yep.
[16:51.570 --> 16:52.150]  Okay.
[16:52.950 --> 16:53.810]  There you go.
[16:55.130 --> 16:57.350]  That was a lot of ribbage
[16:57.350 --> 16:58.270]  for one click.
[16:59.430 --> 17:00.430]  Dark lungs.
[17:01.570 --> 17:02.530]  Yeah, smoking.
[17:02.670 --> 17:03.030]  Definitely.
[17:04.690 --> 17:05.650]  Thorough exam.
[17:06.110 --> 17:07.230]  By examining the organ.
[17:07.330 --> 17:08.470]  Can you put the tool away?
[17:08.770 --> 17:10.730]  Or maybe magnify?
[17:10.970 --> 17:11.450]  Oh, there you go.
[17:13.870 --> 17:14.850]  You just opened his suit.
[17:15.290 --> 17:16.970]  Oh my god.
[17:18.750 --> 17:20.230]  They're so burnt.
[17:20.590 --> 17:21.450]  It doesn't bother me.
[17:23.210 --> 17:24.390]  That doesn't look like
[17:24.390 --> 17:25.490]  an inside of a person.
[17:27.190 --> 17:28.230]  Click on the lung.
[17:29.430 --> 17:30.950]  The picture of the lung.
[17:40.100 --> 17:41.820]  You closing your eyes
[17:41.820 --> 17:43.040]  with a scalpel is crazy.
[17:45.840 --> 17:47.040]  It's stressful.
[17:48.960 --> 17:49.900]  Any ringing
[17:49.900 --> 17:50.400]  in your ears?
[17:51.580 --> 17:53.180]  No ringing, but
[17:53.180 --> 17:55.000]  my whole body feels tingly.
[17:57.420 --> 17:59.180]  What am I doing?
[18:02.300 --> 18:03.340]  What now?
[18:03.600 --> 18:04.500]  Andrew, can you identify
[18:04.500 --> 18:06.060]  all of these organs?
[18:08.620 --> 18:09.580]  Lung 2.
[18:09.820 --> 18:10.340]  Heart.
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.120]  Intestinal tract.
[18:14.040 --> 18:15.260]  I think you gotta do the eye
[18:15.260 --> 18:15.700]  first.
[18:17.640 --> 18:17.880]  No!
[18:18.420 --> 18:18.940]  No!
[18:22.520 --> 18:23.560]  It's right there, man.
[18:24.000 --> 18:24.720]  Oh, he's a rough one.
[18:26.240 --> 18:27.160]  There you go.
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.740]  You put it away.
[18:28.800 --> 18:29.860]  Select the syringe.
[18:31.640 --> 18:32.840]  There you go.
[18:32.880 --> 18:34.700]  There you go.
[18:34.760 --> 18:35.540]  That's fine.
[18:36.660 --> 18:37.420]  That's a distance.
[18:38.340 --> 18:39.780]  That feels far away.
[18:41.720 --> 18:42.940]  That's the heart?
[18:44.360 --> 18:45.320]  Feels pretty low
[18:45.320 --> 18:45.920]  to be the heart.
[18:46.600 --> 18:47.820]  Heart should be up here.
[18:48.640 --> 18:50.060]  Heart should be over here, obviously.
[18:50.760 --> 18:52.680]  They just called that out as the heart.
[18:54.880 --> 18:55.740]  Maybe I did.
[18:55.840 --> 18:56.200]  I don't know.
[18:56.280 --> 18:57.400]  I don't know what's happening right now.
[18:57.460 --> 18:59.200]  My brain is scrambled.
[19:00.980 --> 19:02.540]  Retrieve the notebook from the office.
[19:02.800 --> 19:02.960]  Okay.
[19:05.380 --> 19:06.720]  What is a syringe?
[19:08.160 --> 19:08.640]  It's a thing
[19:08.640 --> 19:09.480]  that spins.
[19:10.900 --> 19:11.420]  Oh, okay.
[19:12.740 --> 19:13.180]  Bathroom.
[19:13.500 --> 19:16.480]  So it might be like a little thing that hangs
[19:16.480 --> 19:18.500]  a bunch of test tubes and spins them outwards.
[19:18.700 --> 19:18.900]  Yeah.
[19:23.720 --> 19:24.080]  Alright.
[19:24.860 --> 19:26.080]  So let's go back.
[19:26.960 --> 19:28.320]  I'm assuming to in here
[19:28.980 --> 19:30.980]  where I would put mine if I had one.
[19:37.580 --> 19:38.300]  Samples in.
[19:40.160 --> 19:40.520]  Bloop.
[19:40.960 --> 19:42.700]  Alright, you got a lot of juice out of its eye.
[19:42.920 --> 19:44.060]  Yeah, that's a lot of eye juice.
[19:44.340 --> 19:45.100]  A lot of eye juice.
[19:45.880 --> 19:47.760]  And that's only one eye. There could be more.
[19:53.440 --> 19:54.420]  Do you think they'll use this
[19:54.420 --> 19:55.280]  as a training video?
[19:55.940 --> 19:56.560]  I think so, yeah.
[19:58.740 --> 19:59.180]  Speed.
[20:00.840 --> 20:01.860]  How do I? Okay.
[20:03.100 --> 20:04.400]  Time 15, speed
[20:04.400 --> 20:04.980]  70.
[20:06.040 --> 20:07.860]  Oh wait, what did it say about the alcohol in the blood?
[20:13.970 --> 20:14.410]  Uh...
[20:14.410 --> 20:16.270]  You said it's a nightie, didn't you?
[20:17.150 --> 20:17.610]  Did I?
[20:19.370 --> 20:19.810]  Okay.
[20:20.510 --> 20:20.950]  Let's roll.
[20:24.250 --> 20:26.550]  A solid hour and a half for this interview.
[20:26.550 --> 20:26.950]  Centrifuge.
[20:28.790 --> 20:30.690]  That's 15, is it not? And that's 70?
[20:30.970 --> 20:31.190]  Yeah.
[20:32.570 --> 20:33.830]  Presence of alcohol in the blood.
[20:36.490 --> 20:37.690]  I bet 5 million?
[20:38.230 --> 20:39.850]  I don't know what I'm... Oh, here we go.
[20:39.890 --> 20:41.430]  You hit the start centrifuge button.
[20:41.810 --> 20:42.290]  And they're off.
[20:43.070 --> 20:43.330]  Yep.
[20:47.710 --> 20:49.330]  Just remember, this is what it's like at the doctor.
[20:49.950 --> 20:50.410]  Uh oh.
[20:51.290 --> 20:52.610]  Oh, he's gonna get up, isn't he?
[20:53.910 --> 20:55.630]  No, no, no, no.
[20:55.630 --> 20:57.730]  No, no, no, no, no.
[20:58.870 --> 21:00.990]  Yeah, let's just look at these samples instead.
[21:03.710 --> 21:04.870]  Ew, yuck.
[21:06.070 --> 21:08.190]  Okay, there they are.
[21:08.830 --> 21:11.270]  Are you supposed to slush it all around after it separates?
[21:11.790 --> 21:12.850]  Yeah, I think so.
[21:15.230 --> 21:16.470]  Return to the autopsy.
[21:17.390 --> 21:17.690]  Alright.
[21:20.210 --> 21:21.330]  Alright, grab it.
[21:21.790 --> 21:22.230]  What?
[21:24.710 --> 21:26.650]  Is there a bullet hole in the heart?
[21:28.910 --> 21:32.110]  Or is that just where one of the arteries goes in?
[21:34.650 --> 21:35.190]  Uh, yeah.
[21:35.270 --> 21:36.950]  That hole doesn't seem right.
[21:38.030 --> 21:39.110]  Click on the picture of the heart.
[21:41.970 --> 21:43.310]  Stomach? Let's do it.
[21:46.310 --> 21:48.330]  You thought you could put 50 burgers in that?
[21:52.270 --> 21:53.410]  I was wrong.
[21:59.350 --> 22:00.510]  Stomach cutting board?
[22:01.230 --> 22:03.470]  Oh god, this is gonna be pretty rough.
[22:03.730 --> 22:04.950]  Alright, Andrew, you got this one.
[22:05.010 --> 22:05.550]  You got it, buddy.
[22:05.890 --> 22:07.530]  We're gonna find some stuff.
[22:07.830 --> 22:08.030]  Yep.
[22:09.230 --> 22:11.070]  Oh, I was looking at the wrong side.
[22:12.030 --> 22:13.530]  You got it. There you go.
[22:14.330 --> 22:15.530]  Oh, you're going lengthways.
[22:15.790 --> 22:17.450]  Yeah, yeah. Well, you have to, you know.
[22:17.450 --> 22:19.530]  Do you have to?
[22:19.890 --> 22:21.790]  Yeah, you gotta cut down, you gotta flay it.
[22:21.790 --> 22:22.790]  You're nailing it, Andrew.
[22:23.130 --> 22:23.910]  You're nailing this.
[22:25.110 --> 22:25.750]  Perfect.
[22:26.610 --> 22:28.490]  There you go.
[22:29.210 --> 22:30.770]  What is that?
[22:31.230 --> 22:31.550]  Food.
[22:34.610 --> 22:36.250]  Oh, that's so gross.
[22:39.990 --> 22:43.030]  Okay, it's just food.
[22:43.390 --> 22:45.710]  We did a surgeon simulator emotion once
[22:45.710 --> 22:47.610]  and Michael cut the stomach open and ate
[22:47.610 --> 22:49.750]  some of the food inside and I threw it
[22:50.250 --> 22:51.950]  there and then on the set.
[23:03.160 --> 23:04.480]  It's just a slingshot.
[23:04.660 --> 23:06.580]  It's just a flesh colored slingshot.
[23:06.600 --> 23:07.280]  It's all it is, easy.
[23:07.660 --> 23:09.100]  A breathable slingshot.
[23:11.800 --> 23:16.220]  Andrew, you're doing so well.
[23:16.220 --> 23:18.380]  I'm doing better than I thought I would.
[23:18.760 --> 23:19.780]  Yeah, you're doing great, man. Way to go.
[23:20.920 --> 23:21.880]  Alright, cut it open.
[23:21.960 --> 23:23.780]  It's the exact same cut as the chest.
[23:28.220 --> 23:29.020]  Very good.
[23:30.620 --> 23:31.560]  Think I got it all?
[23:32.140 --> 23:32.860]  Maybe more of the top.
[23:32.920 --> 23:33.360]  What am I missing?
[23:36.780 --> 23:37.480]  There you go.
[23:39.520 --> 23:41.400]  What's in his windpipe?
[23:42.580 --> 23:43.800]  He choked to death?
[23:44.240 --> 23:45.880]  Looks like Resident Evil almost.
[23:47.440 --> 23:49.840]  It's gonna look like that when he comes back to life here in just a second too.
[23:50.280 --> 23:50.640]  No!
[23:58.060 --> 23:59.940]  He probably threw up and choked to death.
[24:00.360 --> 24:02.140]  He threw up in his mouth and inhaled it.
[24:03.920 --> 24:05.320]  We call it the Bond Scott.
[24:08.040 --> 24:08.400]  ACDC.
[24:08.400 --> 24:11.560]  Yes, sir.
[24:12.860 --> 24:16.100]  The deceased probably fell asleep or fainted after drinking a large amount of alcohol.
[24:16.920 --> 24:21.920]  Concentration suppressed signals in the brain that controls the gag reflex leading to choking.
[24:22.360 --> 24:28.140]  So that's why if you pass out, if you have a friend that passes out, drinking on their side or on their stomach.
[24:29.300 --> 24:31.340]  Maybe Walter White was just watching him.
[24:32.320 --> 24:33.860]  Oh, I have to decide.
[24:33.860 --> 24:34.840]  Decide.
[24:35.960 --> 24:38.380]  I think it was probably just an accident.
[24:38.660 --> 24:39.280]  Don't you think?
[24:39.920 --> 24:40.960]  Now it's all clear.
[24:41.580 --> 24:43.040]  The death was suffocation.
[24:43.540 --> 24:45.700]  Now the mystery is solved.
[24:45.860 --> 24:46.380]  Gizmo.
[24:49.360 --> 24:50.360]  That's a G.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.320]  Down with the G.
[24:52.780 --> 24:53.340]  It's a gizmo.
[24:53.480 --> 24:54.020]  Oh, what?
[24:54.780 --> 24:57.380]  Look at that cursive.
[24:57.680 --> 24:58.100]  And
[24:59.580 --> 25:00.240]  D
[25:00.900 --> 25:01.300]  I
[25:04.100 --> 25:04.500]  Z
[25:04.500 --> 25:06.360]  That's a classic cursive Z.
[25:06.960 --> 25:07.360]  Classic.
[25:08.600 --> 25:10.420]  Oh, it won't let me go anymore.
[25:10.460 --> 25:10.900]  It's a classic.
[25:11.080 --> 25:11.620]  And good.
[25:14.940 --> 25:16.940]  I don't even know what you were going for there.
[25:17.280 --> 25:17.760]  Close the body.
[25:17.880 --> 25:18.880]  Close the body.
[25:20.160 --> 25:22.200]  Oh, I hate this flap the most.
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.140]  We're lower than that one.
[25:24.620 --> 25:26.040]  Alright, go ahead and sew him back up, buddy.
[25:26.260 --> 25:28.060]  No! It's dead.
[25:28.060 --> 25:29.380]  Just leave him like this.
[25:29.460 --> 25:30.720]  Why are we doing this?
[25:31.700 --> 25:33.140]  You gotta put everything back.
[25:35.660 --> 25:38.180]  I'm using the baseball stitch technique.
[25:38.400 --> 25:38.680]  What?
[25:38.880 --> 25:41.240]  This stitching method is very strong and quick to do.
[25:41.380 --> 25:42.580]  The baseball stitch?
[25:42.820 --> 25:43.060]  Yeah.
[25:44.440 --> 25:46.120]  Take him out to the ball game.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.260]  That's his fucking firing staples.
[25:51.600 --> 25:52.160]  Top.
[25:52.620 --> 25:52.900]  Top.
[25:54.020 --> 25:54.580]  There you go.
[25:54.580 --> 25:54.700]  Okay.
[25:58.840 --> 26:00.080]  Leave the body.
[26:00.540 --> 26:01.060]  Thank God.
[26:03.580 --> 26:03.900]  Okay.
[26:05.900 --> 26:08.360]  Get in there, you son of a bitch.
[26:09.020 --> 26:10.060]  Oh, fuck you.
[26:10.340 --> 26:12.160]  Never again. Never again.
[26:12.340 --> 26:14.480]  What do you mean never again? That's the first autopsy, dude.
[26:14.520 --> 26:15.420]  There's more...
[26:16.220 --> 26:16.740]  No!
[26:17.720 --> 26:20.120]  Put your first body in the fridge, dude.
[26:20.700 --> 26:22.260]  I gotta get back to the car.
[26:22.260 --> 26:23.860]  Get me out of here.
[26:24.720 --> 26:26.740]  This is your chosen profession, buddy.
[26:27.920 --> 26:31.460]  I don't blame you.
[26:35.470 --> 26:36.270]  Level one.
[26:38.790 --> 26:40.470]  Finish the prologue.
[26:40.770 --> 26:42.690]  If the person who did your autopsy was a fan.
[26:44.590 --> 26:46.090]  I wouldn't love it.
[26:46.550 --> 26:48.850]  I think it would be worse if it was Andrew.
[26:49.090 --> 26:50.650]  Who, when he was using the scalpel, looked away.
[26:50.710 --> 26:52.830]  And he's like, am I doing it?
[26:53.930 --> 26:54.950]  That's actually...
[26:54.950 --> 26:56.930]  If they all look like this, I'd be okay with it.
[26:57.130 --> 26:58.090]  This is fine.
[26:59.250 --> 27:00.390]  This is never soft.
[27:01.750 --> 27:02.830]  Tony Hawk
[27:02.830 --> 27:04.350]  Pro Skater 5.
[27:04.830 --> 27:05.830]  Buy it now.
[27:08.530 --> 27:08.710]  Oh.
[27:10.130 --> 27:10.810]  Shit.
[27:11.670 --> 27:14.230]  We're gonna get a Terminator?
[27:16.990 --> 27:17.950]  Hell yeah.
[27:19.810 --> 27:20.470]  Hunt Achilles.
[27:20.470 --> 27:22.150]  Oh no, it's Christian Bale.
[27:25.570 --> 27:26.850]  Oh no, you're being swallowed
[27:26.850 --> 27:27.730]  by the skeletons.
[27:29.130 --> 27:30.770]  So many skeletons everywhere.
[27:38.810 --> 27:40.490]  So much job.
[27:43.610 --> 27:44.890]  I think you nailed that.
[27:45.050 --> 27:46.010]  I didn't think...
[27:46.010 --> 27:47.770]  I didn't think you were even close to going down.
[27:49.150 --> 27:50.690]  We should probably do one more
[27:50.690 --> 27:51.810]  because that was just the prologue.
[27:51.930 --> 27:52.870]  Now we're in chapter one.
[27:55.190 --> 27:57.430]  It's hard to articulate
[27:58.270 --> 28:00.450]  just how tingly my whole body was
[28:00.450 --> 28:01.150]  during that.
[28:01.210 --> 28:04.530]  I feel like potentially a lot of it was from the anticipation though.
[28:04.770 --> 28:05.010]  Yeah.
[28:05.490 --> 28:07.930]  When you were actually doing the stuff, I feel like you were just getting on with it
[28:07.930 --> 28:08.790]  and it wasn't actually that bad.
[28:12.170 --> 28:14.150]  I don't care about any of this.
[28:14.470 --> 28:15.470]  You better take your pills, dude.
[28:16.850 --> 28:17.290]  I'm...
[28:17.290 --> 28:18.650]  I'm a real pills guy.
[28:18.810 --> 28:19.550]  I like that it's a plot.
[28:21.030 --> 28:21.230]  Yeah.
[28:25.270 --> 28:26.390]  Where's my pills?
[28:27.910 --> 28:28.630]  Oh, the bathroom.
[28:30.950 --> 28:31.390]  Whoops!
[28:34.310 --> 28:35.250]  Where's the bathroom?
[28:35.670 --> 28:37.390]  You think I would know where my bathroom is?
[28:37.390 --> 28:39.130]  You know you would think
[28:39.130 --> 28:40.650]  and yet, here we are.
[28:41.750 --> 28:42.310]  Where...
[28:44.010 --> 28:45.190]  What am I missing?
[28:45.470 --> 28:45.650]  Oh.
[28:46.510 --> 28:47.070]  Yeah.
[28:50.130 --> 28:50.690]  Pills.
[28:56.050 --> 28:58.770]  I bet you that call was about a body.
[29:00.670 --> 29:01.370]  This is great.
[29:02.010 --> 29:03.650]  I bet you it was going to be someone super dead.
[29:03.990 --> 29:04.430]  Probably.
[29:06.910 --> 29:08.250]  Do you think 90s beige
[29:08.250 --> 29:09.870]  electronics will come back?
[29:10.590 --> 29:11.790]  I hope not.
[29:12.030 --> 29:14.190]  Because they were once white
[29:14.190 --> 29:16.390]  and then they just sort of eventually turn that yellow
[29:16.390 --> 29:17.110]  into color, right?
[29:19.610 --> 29:20.170]  Yeah.
[29:22.170 --> 29:23.770]  Don't retrobrite your phone.
[29:25.930 --> 29:30.410]  Add in a photo of
[29:30.410 --> 29:31.410]  Alice. Okay.
[29:32.170 --> 29:33.670]  That's my wife, I'm assuming.
[29:35.390 --> 29:36.110]  Use this one.
[29:37.450 --> 29:38.010]  Beautiful.
[29:38.530 --> 29:38.730]  I guess.
[29:40.130 --> 29:41.250]  This one.
[29:43.250 --> 29:44.470]  Why isn't this okay?
[29:46.930 --> 29:48.370]  I think probably...
[29:48.370 --> 29:49.770]  Maybe it's not supposed to be in a frame.
[29:49.830 --> 29:51.410]  I would think.
[29:53.570 --> 29:55.490]  It's on the counter of the coffee table, right?
[29:55.990 --> 29:56.870]  Probably the coffee table.
[29:57.250 --> 29:58.290]  I think that's just food.
[29:59.010 --> 29:59.830]  That's coffee.
[30:02.470 --> 30:03.690]  No? Wow.
[30:06.470 --> 30:07.950]  Eric, you get $2500.
[30:08.570 --> 30:10.190]  Okay. But every time you show someone
[30:10.190 --> 30:11.890]  a picture, it has to be printed and framed.
[30:12.290 --> 30:13.770]  You can't ever show someone on your phone.
[30:15.770 --> 30:16.570]  That's brutal.
[30:17.670 --> 30:18.290]  I think
[30:18.290 --> 30:20.170]  I can't. For $2500? I don't think
[30:20.170 --> 30:22.450]  I could do that. I just don't think I could live that way.
[30:23.770 --> 30:24.490]  Oh, here we go.
[30:26.250 --> 30:26.610]  Nope.
[30:27.910 --> 30:28.750]  That's not Alice.
[30:29.110 --> 30:31.170]  Those are dogs.
[30:32.230 --> 30:32.790]  There you go.
[30:32.790 --> 30:33.890]  It was the sun.
[30:34.290 --> 30:35.010]  It's all glare.
[30:38.550 --> 30:39.710]  Maybe the bedroom?
[30:41.610 --> 30:42.530]  Back to the bedroom?
[30:43.070 --> 30:43.550]  Maybe a wallet?
[30:45.270 --> 30:45.650]  There you go.
[30:49.470 --> 30:50.850]  I don't think I have a lot of
[30:50.850 --> 30:51.970]  framed photos.
[30:53.270 --> 30:54.750]  I have a lot of photos
[30:54.750 --> 30:56.690]  and they're up everywhere and everything.
[30:56.830 --> 30:59.110]  It's just not a ton of... Everything's in frames
[30:59.110 --> 31:00.110]  in this game. That's crazy.
[31:06.080 --> 31:06.920]  Cosmic crisp.
[31:07.220 --> 31:07.880]  Right next to it.
[31:08.180 --> 31:08.620]  Nice.
[31:12.700 --> 31:13.560]  Okay, that wasn't
[31:13.560 --> 31:14.960]  the photo to send? Cool.
[31:15.940 --> 31:16.580]  Oh, here we go.
[31:17.520 --> 31:18.420]  A little bit of bunts.
[31:19.120 --> 31:20.940]  Pregnancy test. None of this is
[31:21.940 --> 31:22.840]  what you need, buddy.
[31:24.620 --> 31:25.540]  That's a bunch of money.
[31:26.500 --> 31:27.040]  You Benjamins?
[31:27.180 --> 31:27.340]  Yeah.
[31:33.500 --> 31:33.940]  Spaghetti
[31:33.940 --> 31:35.260]  meatballs on the ground. Alright.
[31:35.260 --> 31:35.480]  Alright.
[31:39.040 --> 31:41.000]  I'm just gonna... Oh wait.
[31:41.260 --> 31:43.440]  Can I go further? Here we go.
[31:43.460 --> 31:44.820]  Hey now. That's the one.
[31:45.180 --> 31:45.600]  There you go.
[31:48.720 --> 31:50.140]  50 years ago.
[31:53.680 --> 31:55.060]  Now you find an envelope.
[31:56.580 --> 31:57.460]  An envelope?
[31:58.500 --> 31:59.000]  Jesus.
[32:03.600 --> 32:04.020]  Fuck.
[32:04.620 --> 32:06.740]  It's an envelope for the body.
[32:09.120 --> 32:10.500]  What else can I open?
[32:13.400 --> 32:14.880]  I think maybe he's just not in his room, pal.
[32:16.480 --> 32:17.160]  Here we go.
[32:21.500 --> 32:22.820]  Time for work.
[32:24.900 --> 32:25.880]  Let's get out of here.
[32:26.240 --> 32:26.820]  Thank God.
[32:29.340 --> 32:30.140]  Mailbox down there?
[32:30.140 --> 32:30.440]  No.
[32:32.560 --> 32:33.080]  Fuck.
[32:34.780 --> 32:35.560]  Did you leave the door open?
[32:35.900 --> 32:36.200]  God.
[32:36.300 --> 32:37.720]  I'm gonna close my door.
[32:39.160 --> 32:40.680]  Gotta do everything around here.
[32:41.780 --> 32:42.820]  Jesus Christ.
[32:43.480 --> 32:45.220]  I got neighbors. What are they good for?
[32:45.660 --> 32:46.340]  Get a rig on!
[32:53.270 --> 32:54.890]  Oh dude. A free hopscotch
[32:54.890 --> 32:55.310]  on the ground.
[33:00.750 --> 33:03.230]  Has anyone ever tried to sell hopscotch?
[33:03.230 --> 33:05.090]  Nah, it's a great idea though.
[33:07.050 --> 33:08.370]  Standard correspondent.
[33:08.830 --> 33:09.970]  I can't mail? Okay.
[33:17.530 --> 33:18.190]  Wow.
[33:18.530 --> 33:20.550]  I did not expect to be able to go outside.
[33:22.070 --> 33:23.370]  How's he getting to work?
[33:24.830 --> 33:26.430]  Not this way, apparently.
[33:27.050 --> 33:27.430]  Shit.
[33:28.410 --> 33:29.990]  Wasn't colored yellow, sir.
[33:30.670 --> 33:31.730]  That's true.
[33:33.390 --> 33:34.390]  Close this.
[33:34.390 --> 33:34.690]  There it is.
[33:34.690 --> 33:37.930]  There it is.
[33:38.210 --> 33:38.690]  Alright.
[33:40.810 --> 33:42.570]  Almost getting to the dead bodies
[33:42.570 --> 33:43.590]  here soon.
[33:48.200 --> 33:50.480]  What if an arm reached out and grabbed you by the throat?
[33:50.880 --> 33:51.520]  That'd be awesome.
[33:53.380 --> 33:54.340]  Time to go.
[33:57.560 --> 33:58.960]  What the fuck?
[33:59.180 --> 34:00.000]  What was that?
[34:00.500 --> 34:04.300]  I heard a noise.
[34:04.300 --> 34:05.620]  We don't have any sound.
[34:05.800 --> 34:09.240]  Do you not know which car is yours?
[34:11.120 --> 34:11.440]  No.
[34:12.020 --> 34:13.340]  What with the glowing door?
[34:17.260 --> 34:17.900]  Fuck that.
[34:18.460 --> 34:20.800]  If they made me go back, I would be so mad.
[34:22.020 --> 34:23.940]  Have you ever driven a car with one of those wheel
[34:24.460 --> 34:25.240]  shifter things?
[34:26.240 --> 34:27.540]  No. Wheel shifters?
[34:27.800 --> 34:29.800]  The stick coming out of the steering wheel.
[34:29.800 --> 34:30.640]  Yeah.
[34:32.400 --> 34:33.900]  My first car had that.
[34:34.240 --> 34:34.500]  Really?
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.220]  You're so American.
[34:37.400 --> 34:39.420]  Had an old pickup truck
[34:39.420 --> 34:39.880]  in it.
[34:41.600 --> 34:42.640]  Sounds like the gear shift.
[34:47.420 --> 34:49.800]  You gotta go to the office.
[34:56.080 --> 34:57.720]  What was the noise?
[34:57.720 --> 34:58.560]  You never found out?
[34:59.460 --> 35:01.680]  No, it was like a shopping cart.
[35:14.800 --> 35:16.360]  Was it a draft?
[35:20.490 --> 35:22.190]  We hate drafts around here.
[35:33.300 --> 35:33.820]  Okay.
[35:34.700 --> 35:36.740]  Don't care about my birthday or any of this.
[35:38.980 --> 35:40.580]  Inspect your muffin!
[35:46.250 --> 35:46.430]  Oh.
[35:51.770 --> 35:52.290]  Alice.
[35:54.450 --> 35:54.890]  Okay.
[36:03.040 --> 36:04.300]  Alright, now you're getting prepped.
[36:04.380 --> 36:04.920]  This is good.
[36:10.380 --> 36:11.000]  Find the
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.680]  protector. I've done this before.
[36:12.800 --> 36:13.820]  I know how this works.
[36:15.080 --> 36:16.320]  Okay. Yeah, you got this.
[36:16.460 --> 36:17.100]  This is old hat.
[36:20.820 --> 36:21.260]  Camcorder.
[36:25.940 --> 36:26.120]  Oh, they were
[36:26.120 --> 36:30.080]  on a talent show. Oh, wow.
[36:31.120 --> 36:31.560]  Crazy.
[36:32.160 --> 36:32.900]  When they die?
[36:34.740 --> 36:35.020]  Maybe.
[36:35.020 --> 36:35.480]  Maybe.
[36:36.920 --> 36:38.400]  Now you're going to cut them open.
[36:40.540 --> 36:41.080]  Okay.
[36:45.320 --> 36:46.760]  Look through the
[36:46.760 --> 36:49.140]  information provided in the police folder.
[36:49.380 --> 36:50.140]  I got it, I got it.
[36:51.600 --> 36:52.940]  Superstar talent show winner
[36:52.940 --> 36:54.060]  Samantha Barker.
[36:56.300 --> 36:57.220]  Oh, wow.
[36:58.260 --> 36:58.720]  Why is
[36:58.720 --> 36:59.800]  Okay, this one
[37:02.060 --> 37:02.660]  Yes!
[37:02.780 --> 37:03.780]  Look at it's stuff!
[37:03.960 --> 37:05.560]  Pills. IDs.
[37:06.140 --> 37:07.860]  Yep, yep. Body found there.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.600]  Crazy in the armchair. Oh, wow.
[37:12.420 --> 37:13.860]  Reckon it was an OD?
[37:16.540 --> 37:18.120]  Okay, gotta remove the clothes.
[37:20.820 --> 37:21.120]  Okay.
[37:22.440 --> 37:23.520]  Pick up the
[37:23.520 --> 37:25.640]  photo camera from the desk drawer.
[37:26.300 --> 37:26.820]  Okay.
[37:27.720 --> 37:29.620]  See, we're cruising now.
[37:29.700 --> 37:30.440]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[37:30.960 --> 37:34.280]  You didn't shut the camera in the drawer before picking it up this time.
[37:34.780 --> 37:35.040]  Nope.
[37:37.420 --> 37:39.460]  Off the rip getting it done.
[37:40.900 --> 37:41.340]  Full body?
[37:42.700 --> 37:43.100]  There you go.
[37:47.400 --> 37:47.920]  That
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.900]  doesn't look good.
[37:57.790 --> 37:59.150]  Uh, hands?
[37:59.530 --> 38:00.550]  Hands are always fucked.
[38:01.250 --> 38:01.470]  Yep.
[38:02.710 --> 38:04.130]  Knees, maybe? Or feet?
[38:05.850 --> 38:06.290]  Feet?
[38:09.010 --> 38:09.950]  Neck, maybe?
[38:11.470 --> 38:12.410]  There you go.
[38:12.810 --> 38:13.390]  Shoulder?
[38:15.690 --> 38:17.110]  Neck. Good call, Gavin.
[38:19.270 --> 38:19.970]  Gavin gets it.
[38:20.030 --> 38:21.630]  I gotta zoom.
[38:22.830 --> 38:23.630]  Oh, mask.
[38:30.190 --> 38:30.670]  Okay.
[38:31.950 --> 38:33.910]  And photos to the...
[38:33.910 --> 38:34.770]  Uh...
[38:34.770 --> 38:36.410]  I don't remember where this was.
[38:36.850 --> 38:38.710]  Where was this again? Oh, over here.
[38:40.210 --> 38:40.910]  There we go.
[38:42.470 --> 38:43.530]  One, two, three.
[38:48.910 --> 38:50.630]  Form the autopsy. Let's do it.
[38:52.450 --> 38:53.450]  Let's get in here.
[38:55.810 --> 39:01.530]  Oh, do I gotta cut him open again?
[39:01.530 --> 39:04.410]  Well, you gotta inspect with a magnifying glass first, buddy.
[39:04.450 --> 39:06.530]  It's the same thing. Yeah, the magnifying glass.
[39:06.590 --> 39:06.970]  There you go.
[39:07.410 --> 39:07.930]  Contusions.
[39:09.390 --> 39:10.890]  They're bruised and stuff.
[39:11.650 --> 39:13.530]  Their hands are all messed up.
[39:13.810 --> 39:14.870]  Probably from a struggle.
[39:15.950 --> 39:16.770]  Numerous blisters.
[39:18.730 --> 39:21.810]  And then the throat is all uneven.
[39:29.470 --> 39:30.110]  Shoulder.
[39:32.630 --> 39:33.610]  Definite tussle.
[39:33.730 --> 39:34.510]  Oh, there's a definite tussle.
[39:36.390 --> 39:37.550]  Let's go to the feet.
[39:39.770 --> 39:40.550]  Next favorite.
[39:41.110 --> 39:43.570]  Yep. He's gonna ask for this to be clipped.
[39:47.210 --> 39:48.550]  Write it down.
[39:51.230 --> 39:53.690]  Highlight the previous found wounds on the clipboard.
[39:55.670 --> 39:57.590]  Nope. Nope. Go back to the autopsy.
[39:57.910 --> 39:59.250]  Nope. Go back to the autopsy.
[39:59.250 --> 40:00.890]  Oh, nope. Nope. Nope. Yep. Why?
[40:01.510 --> 40:01.730]  Why?
[40:02.810 --> 40:03.490]  There we go.
[40:13.590 --> 40:14.470]  Barbiturate poisoning.
[40:14.670 --> 40:17.610]  Definite possible cause.
[40:19.290 --> 40:20.670]  Could be suicide.
[40:22.290 --> 40:24.350]  And then third party involvement is very interesting.
[40:24.510 --> 40:27.170]  Yeah, alcohol also. I think these are all...
[40:27.170 --> 40:27.910]  These all make sense.
[40:30.170 --> 40:31.130]  Oh, okay.
[40:34.270 --> 40:36.250]  Alright, let's do it. See if we're having a...
[40:36.250 --> 40:37.630]  Spummer summer or what.
[40:46.350 --> 40:47.910]  Right hand's clean. How about feet?
[40:49.990 --> 40:52.610]  Okay, nothing on the UV.
[40:52.610 --> 40:54.210]  Nothing to surprise us here.
[40:54.390 --> 40:57.090]  Now gently, we take the deceased by the hand.
[40:57.390 --> 40:57.410]  Okay.
[40:57.970 --> 41:00.910]  Rigor mortis again. Drop the arm and all that.
[41:01.330 --> 41:03.070]  Watch this. Perfect. I'm not gonna fail once.
[41:03.170 --> 41:03.390]  Okay.
[41:04.370 --> 41:06.150]  Now take it slow. Keep it within.
[41:10.370 --> 41:10.810]  Up.
[41:16.010 --> 41:16.450]  Nice.
[41:16.690 --> 41:17.310]  There we go.
[41:18.430 --> 41:20.350]  Since we don't have a definitive lead,
[41:20.350 --> 41:22.430]  we will examine all the key organs
[41:22.430 --> 41:24.050]  one by one.
[41:28.530 --> 41:30.190]  Starting internal inspection, Andrew.
[41:30.270 --> 41:30.670]  Are you ready?
[41:32.430 --> 41:32.830]  Yup.
[41:33.870 --> 41:35.130]  Go ahead and select your scalpel.
[41:35.870 --> 41:36.330]  You got it.
[41:38.350 --> 41:38.510]  Alright.
[41:40.310 --> 41:41.930]  You got it. There you go.
[41:42.030 --> 41:43.690]  I'm not gonna close my eyes this time.
[41:44.230 --> 41:44.670]  That's good.
[41:46.610 --> 41:48.430]  I don't like the part where you go around
[41:48.430 --> 41:49.230]  the belly button.
[41:49.930 --> 41:51.850]  It's American this time.
[41:51.850 --> 41:52.150]  Yup.
[41:54.050 --> 41:55.570]  Can we do a different cut?
[41:55.830 --> 41:57.610]  Go ahead and peel back those skin flaps, buddy.
[41:58.050 --> 41:59.290]  It's gooey!
[42:01.650 --> 42:02.810]  I hate that one.
[42:03.650 --> 42:04.650]  Alright, let's grab
[42:04.650 --> 42:05.990]  those loppers for the ribs.
[42:07.730 --> 42:07.990]  Okay.
[42:08.550 --> 42:08.930]  Snap.
[42:11.050 --> 42:11.990]  Another smoker?
[42:12.890 --> 42:13.670]  Yeah, I guess so.
[42:16.830 --> 42:18.610]  Just need the old syringe
[42:18.610 --> 42:19.790]  here, buddy.
[42:19.970 --> 42:20.050]  Yup.
[42:20.930 --> 42:21.550]  Getting it.
[42:22.890 --> 42:24.770]  That's so much eye juice!
[42:29.990 --> 42:31.190]  That's always so funny
[42:31.190 --> 42:31.920]  about an autopsy.
[42:34.170 --> 42:35.050]  A guy going,
[42:35.150 --> 42:36.170]  eww, eww, eww, eww.
[42:37.910 --> 42:39.730]  Oh, you gotta go to the centrifuge.
[42:41.570 --> 42:42.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:42.690 --> 42:43.570]  It's over here.
[42:45.030 --> 42:46.530]  You have to, you need to
[42:46.530 --> 42:48.090]  get your, uh, notebook.
[42:51.330 --> 42:52.430]  Nope. Where's the note?
[42:52.650 --> 42:54.110]  I would guess it's in the office.
[42:57.580 --> 42:58.440]  That's a good guess
[42:58.440 --> 42:59.720]  considering it says the office.
[43:00.080 --> 43:00.320]  You know?
[43:02.360 --> 43:04.520]  You've really locked in, Eric. I appreciate it.
[43:04.580 --> 43:05.300]  Yeah, you know me, buddy.
[43:08.580 --> 43:10.180]  Why'd you grab that before us, man?
[43:10.220 --> 43:10.740]  What the fuck?
[43:11.660 --> 43:12.240]  Swipe!
[43:17.340 --> 43:18.820]  I assume we're looking
[43:18.820 --> 43:19.820]  for alcohol again.
[43:21.360 --> 43:22.660]  Uh, yeah, I think
[43:22.660 --> 43:23.360]  that's a good guess.
[43:24.880 --> 43:26.800]  Put all my vials in,
[43:26.840 --> 43:27.480]  all my juice.
[43:31.640 --> 43:32.200]  Alright.
[43:32.960 --> 43:34.720]  Look at that. 1570 again.
[43:35.060 --> 43:35.220]  Okay.
[43:39.060 --> 43:39.920]  Almost there.
[43:40.740 --> 43:42.340]  There you go.
[43:46.850 --> 43:47.690]  You're a pro, bud.
[43:48.790 --> 43:49.890]  Spin it around!
[43:53.770 --> 43:55.590]  Uh-oh. What?
[43:56.910 --> 43:58.410]  No! No, no, no, no, no!
[43:58.430 --> 43:59.390]  No, no, no, no, no!
[43:59.430 --> 44:00.330]  No, no, no, no, no.
[44:01.530 --> 44:02.610]  No, no, no, no, no.
[44:03.650 --> 44:04.050]  Oh.
[44:07.970 --> 44:09.090]  I don't like it.
[44:09.090 --> 44:10.490]  Check the breakers in the storeroom.
[44:12.130 --> 44:13.510]  Ah! What the fuck?
[44:13.870 --> 44:15.050]  We gotta go to the storeroom, man.
[44:16.230 --> 44:17.090]  Who was that?
[44:17.370 --> 44:18.430]  I think that was the storeroom.
[44:18.430 --> 44:20.030]  They're probably just checking the fuses, you know?
[44:22.670 --> 44:23.390]  I think this is the...
[44:23.390 --> 44:23.950]  Oh, there you go.
[44:25.630 --> 44:27.410]  Go ahead and just flip those real quick.
[44:30.070 --> 44:31.190]  Great. Great work.
[44:32.230 --> 44:32.510]  Alright.
[44:34.390 --> 44:34.790]  Okay.
[44:35.910 --> 44:37.210]  I don't know why you guys are so freaked out.
[44:37.210 --> 44:38.810]  I don't know what you guys are so freaked out about.
[44:39.110 --> 44:40.630]  You just had to turn the lights back on.
[44:41.430 --> 44:42.750]  What do you mean? You just had to...
[44:42.750 --> 44:43.090]  You're good.
[44:45.430 --> 44:47.570]  Now's not the time for... Answer the phone!
[44:49.270 --> 44:52.210]  Why so rude?
[44:54.270 --> 44:55.070]  Skipping this.
[44:58.330 --> 44:59.490]  They got a lot to say.
[45:03.930 --> 45:04.430]  Uh-oh.
[45:04.910 --> 45:05.910]  Oh, boy.
[45:05.910 --> 45:07.850]  That gave me some real anxiety.
[45:08.170 --> 45:09.690]  Gotta get those pills, baby.
[45:10.250 --> 45:11.150]  Pills, pills, pills, pills, pills.
[45:13.510 --> 45:14.470]  No, come on.
[45:14.850 --> 45:15.130]  Get him.
[45:19.270 --> 45:19.690]  Yeah!
[45:20.110 --> 45:25.570]  At least he...
[45:25.570 --> 45:27.590]  didn't touch brain juice this time.
[45:27.950 --> 45:29.710]  It's true. Just goo.
[45:29.970 --> 45:31.590]  Just handled a lot of goo.
[45:32.370 --> 45:34.030]  I've gotta get back to work.
[45:34.710 --> 45:35.110]  Yep.
[45:40.260 --> 45:40.660]  What?
[45:43.340 --> 45:44.880]  It's like a door that slammed.
[45:45.080 --> 45:46.520]  Collect those samples, man. You're good.
[45:47.080 --> 45:48.720]  Yeah, I'm going for them.
[45:49.980 --> 45:50.760]  There you go.
[45:54.620 --> 45:55.160]  Let's see.
[45:59.680 --> 46:00.080]  What?
[46:01.680 --> 46:02.780]  The radio turned on.
[46:03.340 --> 46:04.940]  I can't hear it, but the radio just turned on.
[46:04.940 --> 46:05.580]  Oh, shit.
[46:06.100 --> 46:07.700]  You just don't need to listen to that, though.
[46:08.360 --> 46:09.900]  There you go.
[46:10.880 --> 46:12.360]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[46:12.760 --> 46:14.300]  That's a lot of alcohol, buddy.
[46:19.320 --> 46:19.780]  Alright.
[46:23.560 --> 46:24.500]  To the rack.
[46:26.400 --> 46:28.100]  Rack, rack, rack. Where's the rack?
[46:29.480 --> 46:30.380]  Over here?
[46:30.760 --> 46:30.980]  No.
[46:32.600 --> 46:33.640]  Where's the rack?
[46:37.450 --> 46:38.010]  On the...
[46:38.010 --> 46:39.710]  Is it on the left of the table with the centrifuge?
[46:43.880 --> 46:44.740]  Like at the other end?
[46:44.860 --> 46:46.020]  I'm not seeing it.
[46:48.480 --> 46:49.780]  A considerable collection.
[46:50.280 --> 46:51.040]  I don't see it.
[46:56.080 --> 46:58.420]  Maybe we stop here, because Eric has an out.
[46:58.720 --> 46:59.460]  And we...
[46:59.460 --> 47:01.560]  I do, but I want to know about the rack.
[47:01.920 --> 47:03.900]  I can always dip out, and you guys can keep going.
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.640]  Because I want to know about... I want to know what happens.
[47:05.640 --> 47:07.140]  I want to know why the radio turned on.
[47:09.180 --> 47:10.080]  Where's the rack?
[47:11.780 --> 47:12.900]  That's the iWatch station.
[47:16.780 --> 47:17.140]  Fuck!
[47:17.840 --> 47:18.660]  Where did I put it?
[47:18.780 --> 47:19.680]  What do you mean? It's just the rack.
[47:21.520 --> 47:23.260]  Look, there's a picture of the rack on the board.
[47:27.690 --> 47:28.410]  Bottom right.
[47:30.670 --> 47:31.010]  Yeah.
[47:32.490 --> 47:33.850]  Where the fuck is that thing?
[47:35.190 --> 47:36.590]  Is it up to the left?
[47:38.190 --> 47:39.310]  See the thing that's glowing?
[47:40.050 --> 47:41.850]  Nope. Right? Down?
[47:44.670 --> 47:46.410]  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was glowing.
[47:46.650 --> 47:48.150]  It is just the handle of something.
[47:49.270 --> 47:50.170]  What would that be though?
[47:50.170 --> 47:51.410]  The glowing business card?
[47:51.650 --> 47:52.430]  Yeah, I don't know.
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.260]  I have to know where the rack is.
[48:01.220 --> 48:03.440]  I think it has to be outside of here.
[48:03.660 --> 48:03.920]  No!
[48:04.660 --> 48:05.100]  Why?
[48:05.440 --> 48:06.120]  That's crazy.
[48:08.380 --> 48:09.360]  There's a lab.
[48:09.440 --> 48:10.660]  That's a different room.
[48:10.960 --> 48:12.500]  The lab is a different room.
[48:12.920 --> 48:13.580]  Well, we found it.
[48:15.420 --> 48:16.780]  I'm good with stopping here.
[48:17.420 --> 48:19.320]  Why? You don't want to pass out?
[48:20.280 --> 48:20.580]  Yeah.
[48:21.220 --> 48:22.860]  I'm feeling it a little bit. I'm getting a little nervous.
[48:23.780 --> 48:24.960]  Draw the fluid.
[48:25.400 --> 48:27.600]  This can be our outro as you draw the fluid.
[48:28.020 --> 48:29.180]  Guys, thanks for watching.
[48:29.540 --> 48:31.060]  Do you think Andrew did a great job?
[48:31.060 --> 48:33.340]  Do you think Andrew did a great job of not passing out?
[48:35.200 --> 48:37.020]  He's drawing the correct amount
[48:37.020 --> 48:39.560]  of milliliters right now.
[48:41.320 --> 48:42.320]  Almost there, buddy.
[48:42.940 --> 48:44.680]  There you go.
[48:46.040 --> 48:47.160]  Check out the podcast.
[48:47.480 --> 48:48.280]  Check out the Patreon.
[48:48.940 --> 48:50.440]  Check out everything we got going on.
[48:50.520 --> 48:53.120]  Let us know if Andrew should continue to...
[48:55.460 --> 48:55.960]  What?
[48:56.380 --> 48:56.520]  What?
[48:57.220 --> 48:57.660]  What?
[48:58.200 --> 48:59.800]  I think you did it, didn't you?
[49:01.380 --> 49:01.820]  What?
[49:02.580 --> 49:04.040]  Oh, you plunged it back in.
[49:06.040 --> 49:06.840]  There you go.
[49:09.180 --> 49:10.940]  Alright, guys.
[49:11.080 --> 49:12.220]  We'll see you next time.
[49:12.300 --> 49:13.700]  Thanks for watching. Bye!
[49:14.060 --> 49:14.300]  Bye!
