[00:00.000 --> 00:02.940]  I was well on my way to accomplishing something.
[00:03.360 --> 00:05.320]  And then Andrew led me down a stupid road.
[00:06.120 --> 00:09.200]  Let's go ahead and throw a crane on that just to be safe.
[00:10.180 --> 00:12.480]  What do you mean? You took us around a winding road!
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.820]  I took us down a road and then you fell and then I saved you and I said I'll stay here.
[00:17.980 --> 00:21.880]  And then you went up the road that you're calling stupid and fell again.
[00:22.120 --> 00:23.680]  Who's the menace of that duo?
[00:24.020 --> 00:25.160]  It sounds like it's Nick.
[00:25.280 --> 00:26.500]  It's definitely Nick!
[00:27.640 --> 00:29.620]  It's Nick and it's not close.
[00:29.620 --> 00:32.220]  How did you... hey, did you fall too?
[00:32.860 --> 00:37.080]  I did because you put yourself up the road that you called a bad road.
[00:37.440 --> 00:38.120]  Yeah, I needed gas.
[00:38.340 --> 00:40.360]  I said I would fill you up with gas.
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.440]  You're gonna fill me up?
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.180]  Nick is absolutely the menace.
[00:43.460 --> 00:46.320]  Nick seems to be in sort of dismissive not listening mode.
[00:48.140 --> 00:49.980]  Andrew, I don't blame you. I blame you.
[00:50.100 --> 00:51.380]  Well, that's very big of you to thank him.
[00:51.380 --> 00:54.700]  I don't... but Andrew, I don't blame... like there was any blame to go around.
[00:54.700 --> 00:59.640]  Well, I will say that we could have taken a more less windy road.
