[00:00.000 --> 00:02.240]  Hey guys, welcome to the stream.
[00:02.620 --> 00:06.080]  If you can see this, it's because somebody hit the button early, but...
[00:06.080 --> 00:13.060]  Hey Gavin, I watched an interview on the Rich Eisen show from Geoff Daniels that was just from like a week or two ago
[00:13.060 --> 00:16.040]  where he was talking about when he gets blown up in that movie.
[00:16.660 --> 00:27.480]  Like, he said that he had watched an interview with Roy Scheider on the scene where he sees the shark for the first time
[00:27.480 --> 00:33.540]  and like whips around in like his face. And he said, oh, what I did for that moment was I had my cheeks like hot.
[00:33.680 --> 00:35.700]  I made sure they were like tense and then I let him drop.
[00:36.020 --> 00:40.200]  And then Geoff Daniels said that that's the same thing that he did for Speed.
[00:40.560 --> 00:43.260]  And he's like, we did it in one take. And they just said like, action.
[00:43.360 --> 00:45.500]  I did it. And then it was like, cut. That's lunch.
[00:45.820 --> 00:47.420]  He's like, it was great. It was fucking awesome.
[00:47.880 --> 00:50.020]  So cool. I thought that was so awesome.
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.920]  I also thought that was awesome. So then I went back and I rewatched that scene and I didn't really notice.
[00:55.920 --> 00:56.760]  Did you see the same thing?
[00:57.440 --> 01:04.560]  Yeah, I saw the exact same thing and him talking about like he didn't accept it at first because the guy died in the elevator in the beginning.
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.680]  And so they rewrote it to like three quarters of the way in.
[01:08.780 --> 01:12.720]  But then I went and rewatched the scene and I really don't notice what he's talking about.
[01:12.860 --> 01:15.120]  It is not like he's fine in it.
[01:15.400 --> 01:17.080]  Yeah, but it didn't. I don't know.
[01:17.180 --> 01:21.040]  Oh, I think like you could definitely like say see like his face drop.
[01:21.120 --> 01:22.300]  Yeah, I can remember his face.
[01:22.300 --> 01:29.440]  I think he delivers a great... I guess, I don't know, the way it was described in my head, I thought it would be a more noticeable shift.
[01:29.820 --> 01:30.700]  It's a great performance.
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.420]  No, it's subtle. It's really subtle. That's why it works. That's why it's so good.
[01:35.800 --> 01:37.860]  Did you know that originally they were going to have him be the bad guy?
[01:38.820 --> 01:40.220]  Oh, I didn't know that. Really?
[01:40.640 --> 01:41.040]  Didn't know that.
[01:41.340 --> 01:42.720]  Welcome to the speed stream.
[01:43.220 --> 01:44.900]  Welcome guys, welcome to the speed stream.
[01:45.140 --> 01:50.940]  We were talking about my wife just watched... she just put on speed when we got done doing some stuff we were doing earlier.
[01:50.940 --> 01:52.320]  And I'm like, oh, fuck it. I'm gonna watch speed.
[01:52.380 --> 01:56.420]  I think she sent a picture to her to our friend Alyssa of me.
[01:56.540 --> 01:58.260]  I was waiting for a cup of coffee to finish brewing.
[01:58.440 --> 02:03.480]  And it's me doing the dad thing of standing up on this side of the room and watching the movie.
[02:04.460 --> 02:06.520]  And it was like, I'm just waiting for this coffee.
[02:07.480 --> 02:11.360]  If I walked in to a room and someone was watching speed, I would sit right down.
[02:11.460 --> 02:12.860]  That's the next hour and a half done.
[02:12.860 --> 02:15.500]  But I was waiting. It's not that I wasn't watching speed.
[02:15.540 --> 02:17.760]  It's that I was waiting for this cup of coffee to finish.
[02:17.980 --> 02:20.240]  So like I wanted the coffee so much.
[02:20.240 --> 02:27.620]  I like that movie so much that I'm fine with the fact that the bus seems to hit some sort of invisible ramp and somehow make that impossible jump.
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.960]  I can't believe that you shit-talked the first Top Gun, but love speed to this extent.
[02:34.060 --> 02:35.620]  That's not shit-talking!
[02:36.020 --> 02:36.580]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:37.880 --> 02:39.380]  I'm not talking to you, Eric. It's him.
[02:39.840 --> 02:41.680]  Speed's a great... it's a great pace.
[02:41.800 --> 02:43.020]  You know, it's action all the time.
[02:43.140 --> 02:46.180]  The bus crashes into a plane for some reason.
[02:46.640 --> 02:47.000]  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
[02:47.040 --> 02:49.540]  Top Gun...
[02:50.400 --> 02:50.920]  Uh...
[02:50.920 --> 02:53.040]  What happens in Top Gun?
[02:53.620 --> 02:55.580]  They play music in a bar.
[02:56.420 --> 02:56.680]  Uh...
[02:56.680 --> 03:00.500]  A guy gets his head crushed by the fucking thing.
[03:00.660 --> 03:02.060]  They're flying jets around.
[03:02.240 --> 03:03.460]  It's just a cool movie.
[03:03.740 --> 03:04.700]  It's a cool guy movie.
[03:06.960 --> 03:07.480]  It's...
[03:07.480 --> 03:09.660]  It's not a good re-watch.
[03:10.500 --> 03:10.720]  Nah.
[03:11.000 --> 03:11.460]  I agree.
[03:12.500 --> 03:16.540]  However, Top Gun Maverick, I will watch...
[03:16.540 --> 03:17.600]  I would watch ten times.
[03:17.600 --> 03:19.360]  It just looks awesome.
[03:19.620 --> 03:21.240]  I think I'm a big Tony Scott guy.
[03:21.380 --> 03:22.980]  So maybe that's my...
[03:22.980 --> 03:25.040]  I watched Top Gun Maverick in
[03:26.740 --> 03:27.860]  4DX or whatever.
[03:28.680 --> 03:29.560]  And, uh...
[03:29.560 --> 03:31.420]  I got hammered with a buddy
[03:31.420 --> 03:32.440]  and we watched it.
[03:32.780 --> 03:35.060]  And it was so... God, it was so cool.
[03:35.500 --> 03:36.620]  I just loved it.
[03:36.720 --> 03:39.540]  It was like we just got thrown around.
[03:40.000 --> 03:40.840]  It rocked.
[03:41.020 --> 03:42.240]  Guys, we're playing Tricky Towers.
[03:42.840 --> 03:45.620]  Hey guys, get piss-reds in the chat. Let's go!
[03:45.620 --> 03:46.080]  Oh shit!
[03:46.880 --> 03:49.760]  We also have another one that looks like a rat sitting on a
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.200]  toilet? What the fuck is that?
[03:51.540 --> 03:53.500]  It's another version of piss-red.
[03:53.620 --> 03:54.280]  Oh god, okay.
[03:55.480 --> 03:57.680]  Wait, did we come up with like a
[03:57.680 --> 03:58.720]  nameplate thing for this?
[04:00.240 --> 04:01.580]  How's anyone gonna know who's who?
[04:01.900 --> 04:02.220]  You're right.
[04:03.220 --> 04:04.760]  It's a great question. Luckily, we're live.
[04:06.320 --> 04:07.320]  I can fix it.
[04:08.360 --> 04:08.940]  Uh, okay.
[04:09.600 --> 04:10.740]  Well, I'm on the far left.
[04:11.500 --> 04:13.640]  Did I win? I'm the wizard
[04:13.640 --> 04:15.280]  on the far right that's already done.
[04:15.600 --> 04:16.980]  What am I supposed to do?
[04:17.100 --> 04:19.760]  You're not supposed to hit that line. You're supposed to delay this
[04:19.760 --> 04:20.520]  as long as possible.
[04:20.760 --> 04:22.460]  Oh, fuck!
[04:23.580 --> 04:25.040]  Wait, then how come you're still going?
[04:25.380 --> 04:26.220]  Because I'm gonna win.
[04:26.980 --> 04:29.000]  Right, but you've already won.
[04:29.480 --> 04:29.660]  Oh.
[04:31.880 --> 04:32.120]  Alright.
[04:33.220 --> 04:34.660]  Let me make a nameplate.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.960]  Wait, so what's the point?
[04:39.500 --> 04:40.240]  I don't know.
[04:40.240 --> 04:42.180]  It's to have as many blocks
[04:42.180 --> 04:44.240]  on the thing below the line.
[04:45.740 --> 04:47.340]  Gavin won. I got two.
[04:47.780 --> 04:49.620]  Nick got three. Andrew got nothing.
[04:49.740 --> 04:52.620]  I was first, so I came in dead last. I was like, let me get to that line!
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.340]  Okay, this is survival
[04:54.340 --> 04:55.320]  mode normal, guys.
[04:56.240 --> 04:58.120]  We decided to pick a game that I'm gonna be
[04:58.120 --> 04:59.880]  so fucking bad at, it's gonna be embarrassing.
[04:59.880 --> 05:01.220]  I didn't know you're not a Tetris guy.
[05:01.720 --> 05:04.020]  I'm not at all. I don't have the patience
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.600]  or the brains for this shit.
[05:05.760 --> 05:07.720]  Also, isn't Tetris when you press up?
[05:08.520 --> 05:09.540]  I'm classically dumb.
[05:11.220 --> 05:11.940]  This doesn't...
[05:11.940 --> 05:13.060]  Oh no!
[05:13.620 --> 05:15.420]  Does it? You can slam it down.
[05:15.580 --> 05:17.240]  Yeah, this rotates it.
[05:17.440 --> 05:19.680]  Just hold down. Yeah, but that's like a slowdown.
[05:19.780 --> 05:20.980]  I'm talking about like, wha-pam!
[05:22.060 --> 05:23.500]  Yeah, how come there's no wha-pam button?
[05:23.800 --> 05:25.180]  There is no wha-pam button.
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.940]  So am I trying to lose or win?
[05:28.020 --> 05:30.140]  What am I trying to do? Yeah, I don't know what we're trying to do.
[05:30.160 --> 05:31.840]  Try to survive. Survive as long as possible?
[05:32.000 --> 05:32.740]  Survive what? Yeah!
[05:33.420 --> 05:34.800]  Oh, I think you have... Build me a tower!
[05:36.580 --> 05:37.260]  I don't know.
[05:37.360 --> 05:38.680]  I don't remember how to play this game.
[05:38.780 --> 05:40.840]  I think you have... What happened?
[05:41.520 --> 05:42.860]  Oh, I have magic now?
[05:43.020 --> 05:45.120]  You get an ability.
[05:45.300 --> 05:47.120]  So if you're worried about stuff, you can lock
[05:47.780 --> 05:49.620]  or like, send other
[05:50.460 --> 05:51.860]  things to screw other people over.
[05:51.980 --> 05:52.980]  Nick, I need to tell you right now.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.720]  I appreciate your coaching here.
[05:54.800 --> 05:57.100]  I need to tell you that I'm not going to worry about any of this
[05:57.100 --> 05:59.380]  ever at all because I'm not smart enough to.
[05:59.700 --> 06:00.840]  Fuck! That's alright.
[06:01.940 --> 06:02.300]  No!
[06:02.300 --> 06:04.620]  Oh, I see.
[06:05.780 --> 06:06.740]  Oh, Nick sees.
[06:07.100 --> 06:07.780]  Guys, Nick sees.
[06:08.420 --> 06:10.020]  Well, if I die, I can make the dam.
[06:10.620 --> 06:12.540]  Yeah, so every time you lose a block
[06:12.540 --> 06:14.340]  off the side, you lose a life.
[06:14.980 --> 06:16.440]  I'm doing that quite a lot.
[06:16.760 --> 06:17.280]  Whoops!
[06:18.920 --> 06:19.640]  Oh no!
[06:19.960 --> 06:21.300]  All my lives!
[06:25.700 --> 06:26.740]  I died
[06:26.740 --> 06:28.000]  so fast.
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.480]  I was cooking
[06:30.480 --> 06:32.220]  and then I died, baby.
[06:33.080 --> 06:34.320]  Alright, we need to somehow get
[06:34.320 --> 06:35.300]  names on the screen.
[06:37.400 --> 06:38.560]  Nick's going to figure it out right
[06:39.120 --> 06:39.520]  now.
[06:40.900 --> 06:41.940]  Here we go.
[06:42.900 --> 06:44.260]  Guys, this is race normal.
[06:44.720 --> 06:46.120]  So we're trying to get as high as possible.
[06:46.120 --> 06:48.440]  Try to get to the line fast. This is a race.
[06:48.840 --> 06:50.780]  Try to get to that top cross line
[06:50.780 --> 06:52.040]  as quickly as you can.
[06:54.980 --> 06:56.140]  I'll accept my loss
[06:56.140 --> 06:57.840]  to make this stupid thing.
[06:57.840 --> 06:59.420]  Did you get
[06:59.420 --> 07:01.480]  names on the screen? Not yet.
[07:02.180 --> 07:02.600]  Oh.
[07:05.830 --> 07:06.390]  Oh!
[07:07.010 --> 07:08.130]  Oh no!
[07:09.150 --> 07:09.990]  What's the matter?
[07:11.270 --> 07:11.830]  Andrew!
[07:13.650 --> 07:15.070]  I'm on the far left.
[07:15.430 --> 07:16.990]  I'm all the way on the right. I'm the far right.
[07:17.170 --> 07:18.190]  I'm the third one.
[07:20.310 --> 07:21.230]  Oh no!
[07:21.610 --> 07:21.850]  Nick.
[07:23.890 --> 07:25.390]  I'm just trying to have a nice
[07:25.390 --> 07:26.710]  neat tetral.
[07:26.710 --> 07:27.750]  Me too.
[07:27.770 --> 07:29.090]  I don't like this.
[07:32.310 --> 07:33.330]  Oh shit!
[07:35.930 --> 07:36.890]  Guys, if you're wondering
[07:36.890 --> 07:38.970]  who is who, Nick is getting names on the screen
[07:38.970 --> 07:40.410]  as we speak.
[07:40.670 --> 07:41.430]  No! No!
[07:43.870 --> 07:46.190]  I had just unfucked something
[07:46.190 --> 07:48.070]  and then immediately fucked it.
[07:48.910 --> 07:50.610]  What color is best for this?
[07:51.070 --> 07:52.390]  Black? White?
[07:52.490 --> 07:55.010]  Black with white outline.
[07:55.630 --> 07:56.990]  Cool. How do you do that?
[07:57.470 --> 07:58.470]  Oh no!
[08:00.770 --> 08:02.870]  So you can leave nice gaps
[08:02.870 --> 08:04.550]  I guess sometimes. Oh, don't fall!
[08:04.770 --> 08:05.690]  Don't fall you schmuck!
[08:07.950 --> 08:08.930]  I'm getting a bit of a
[08:08.930 --> 08:11.070]  wobble on. Yeah, it happens.
[08:11.310 --> 08:12.670]  Get up there!
[08:12.670 --> 08:14.610]  I've been wobbling for so long.
[08:14.850 --> 08:15.670]  What does this do?
[08:16.730 --> 08:18.530]  Do you get names on the screen? No.
[08:19.550 --> 08:20.150]  Oh, okay.
[08:20.370 --> 08:22.210]  Say another word and I will kill you.
[08:23.630 --> 08:24.490]  I just want to know
[08:24.490 --> 08:25.610]  if you got names on the screen. No!
[08:26.190 --> 08:27.310]  You'll be able to tell.
[08:28.010 --> 08:30.170]  This has been the week of Nick screaming at
[08:30.170 --> 08:32.450]  Eric. Yeah, what's with that?
[08:32.550 --> 08:34.250]  And for no reason too. Yeah, no reason.
[08:35.090 --> 08:36.350]  Oh shit, I thought that was the
[08:36.350 --> 08:37.490]  finish line and I've just...
[08:37.490 --> 08:40.110]  No! I'm an absolute
[08:40.110 --> 08:42.450]  tool. Oh, fuck me.
[08:42.450 --> 08:44.210]  And I've always known that. I just fucked this.
[08:45.050 --> 08:45.850]  So bad.
[08:47.050 --> 08:47.830]  What am I doing with this?
[08:47.830 --> 08:48.370]  Oh no!
[08:48.370 --> 08:49.450]  Oh no!
[08:49.990 --> 08:51.690]  Oh, I hate this game.
[08:52.890 --> 08:54.290]  Why did you pick this?
[08:54.530 --> 08:55.430]  Die. What does this do?
[08:56.130 --> 08:57.890]  What is this? Is this a house?
[08:58.370 --> 08:59.150]  Is that a piano?
[09:00.130 --> 09:00.850]  What happened?
[09:02.870 --> 09:04.110]  Your ability is
[09:04.110 --> 09:05.270]  throwing furniture?
[09:06.130 --> 09:07.850]  No, my tower!
[09:10.610 --> 09:12.030]  Oh, I'm in hell.
[09:12.630 --> 09:13.950]  No, what is that?
[09:14.830 --> 09:16.310]  I put a balloon on your
[09:16.310 --> 09:17.610]  stuff, I guess. Why did you...
[09:19.470 --> 09:22.430]  Nick, you need to lose the next one.
[09:22.910 --> 09:23.970]  Oh, is that locked in now?
[09:25.510 --> 09:26.150]  Is what locked?
[09:26.930 --> 09:28.310]  I made like a...
[09:28.910 --> 09:30.130]  A gammy one.
[09:30.590 --> 09:30.990]  Yeah.
[09:33.170 --> 09:34.070]  Come on, son.
[09:34.510 --> 09:35.370]  You've got this.
[09:36.170 --> 09:38.330]  Chat, when somebody says who's who, just let
[09:38.330 --> 09:39.890]  them know and then we'll get names on the screen.
[09:40.590 --> 09:40.990]  No!
[09:42.350 --> 09:44.130]  Oh, I had it! I
[09:44.130 --> 09:45.450]  bloody had it there.
[09:47.630 --> 09:48.890]  No, no.
[09:49.210 --> 09:51.810]  3, 2, 1, done!
[09:52.290 --> 09:52.570]  Baby!
[09:53.950 --> 09:56.610]  I've never been good at these games!
[09:57.170 --> 09:58.250]  I'm gonna do so bad!
[09:58.650 --> 09:59.330]  First place, baby!
[10:02.410 --> 10:03.450]  Look at that.
[10:03.910 --> 10:06.370]  Maybe the Eric's in the chat. That's what I'm talking about.
[10:06.830 --> 10:07.470]  Look at this.
[10:07.910 --> 10:08.670]  It's me, baby!
[10:10.150 --> 10:10.930]  Locked in!
[10:10.930 --> 10:11.730]  Normal.
[10:12.590 --> 10:12.850]  Puzzle!
[10:14.570 --> 10:15.190]  Puzzle!
[10:17.450 --> 10:18.690]  Oh, I see.
[10:18.870 --> 10:19.090]  Alright.
[10:20.050 --> 10:21.030]  That's interesting.
[10:22.910 --> 10:24.530]  Alright, I'm almost done here.
[10:25.790 --> 10:26.450]  Thanks, Nick.
[10:26.830 --> 10:27.590]  Oh, you're welcome.
[10:28.150 --> 10:28.710]  Oh, no!
[10:29.430 --> 10:30.090]  Oh, no!
[10:30.190 --> 10:36.890]  Am I supposed to...
[10:36.890 --> 10:38.390]  Oh, no.
[10:38.390 --> 10:38.690]  No!
[10:42.370 --> 10:43.910]  Will this go here?
[10:47.590 --> 10:48.610]  Oh, no!
[10:51.990 --> 10:52.570]  Oh, boy.
[10:53.670 --> 10:55.610]  Bad news bears.
[10:57.850 --> 11:01.470]  Oh, no!
[11:02.530 --> 11:03.930]  But didn't you just bin a load
[11:03.930 --> 11:04.890]  of stuff off the side?
[11:05.870 --> 11:08.030]  I just fucked my thing.
[11:10.370 --> 11:11.470]  Who's that? Did you win, Gavin?
[11:12.370 --> 11:14.070]  So that's who can get the most
[11:14.070 --> 11:16.130]  in there. Yeah, it's just the most
[11:16.630 --> 11:17.290]  in it.
[11:18.010 --> 11:19.750]  I'm getting so much smaller.
[11:21.810 --> 11:24.290]  Okay, this is to not lose pieces in survival.
[11:27.950 --> 11:28.810]  Three lives.
[11:29.990 --> 11:32.170]  This is a game Geoff should play, not Eric.
[11:33.730 --> 11:34.850]  You won a round!
[11:35.390 --> 11:36.690]  I don't like this.
[11:38.330 --> 11:39.050]  I'm not
[11:39.050 --> 11:40.550]  smart enough for this.
[11:40.630 --> 11:42.550]  You keep saying that, but you won a round.
[11:42.750 --> 11:44.850]  I got lucky on one round.
[11:49.290 --> 11:50.690]  Alright, I'm just gonna do
[11:50.690 --> 11:52.770]  this temp one for now, and then I'll add the
[11:52.770 --> 11:54.770]  other one later. What's that? Was that Names?
[11:55.150 --> 11:55.330]  Yeah.
[12:01.050 --> 12:01.610]  That's Names.
[12:02.550 --> 12:04.350]  Awesome. Thanks, Nick.
[12:10.100 --> 12:10.940]  Can I not label it?
[12:11.200 --> 12:13.160]  Look at you.
[12:14.580 --> 12:17.500]  Oh, what?
[12:17.760 --> 12:18.880]  Fuck! No!
[12:20.020 --> 12:22.080]  Oh my god, I shot
[12:22.080 --> 12:24.140]  my tower with lightning and fucked
[12:24.140 --> 12:25.860]  it. You shot your own tower?
[12:26.340 --> 12:28.240]  Yeah, I didn't. I'm learning what these abilities
[12:28.240 --> 12:30.140]  do. What does this do?
[12:32.220 --> 12:33.320]  What just happened?
[12:34.180 --> 12:35.000]  Did I just put
[12:35.840 --> 12:37.940]  a freaking roof on my stuff?
[12:37.940 --> 12:38.840]  What did I just do?
[12:40.580 --> 12:41.420]  Oh, sod.
[12:41.920 --> 12:43.120]  Oh, balls.
[12:44.300 --> 12:45.880]  Well, I got here just in time
[12:45.880 --> 12:46.260]  to die.
[12:48.160 --> 12:49.920]  Oh, it's going faster now.
[12:50.720 --> 12:51.720]  Yes, it is.
[12:53.300 --> 12:54.500]  Oh, I don't like this.
[12:56.240 --> 12:57.140]  Lightning's my tower.
[13:01.680 --> 13:02.660]  Oh, that was lucky.
[13:03.020 --> 13:04.920]  I suppose I can also move these to the top.
[13:05.720 --> 13:06.900]  Better down there than the top.
[13:09.980 --> 13:11.020]  Oh, no.
[13:11.280 --> 13:12.140]  Oh, no!
[13:13.980 --> 13:15.600]  Guys, Eric might be falling apart.
[13:16.100 --> 13:16.620]  Fellas!
[13:18.780 --> 13:21.640]  Eric, you're doing so good!
[13:24.580 --> 13:25.020]  There I go.
[13:25.460 --> 13:25.760]  Oh!
[13:27.520 --> 13:30.220]  Outlasted, boys! That's how the rats do it!
[13:32.240 --> 13:33.540]  What do you think? Better?
[13:34.640 --> 13:35.820]  Yeah, dude, that looks so good.
[13:36.400 --> 13:37.540]  Or do you want it at the top?
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.400]  I love it.
[13:39.580 --> 13:41.560]  I think the top... I think it's better at the bottom.
[13:41.740 --> 13:42.160]  Okay, sweet.
[13:43.260 --> 13:45.000]  Well, I was going pretty well there,
[13:45.020 --> 13:46.820]  and then I choked on urine.
[13:47.380 --> 13:48.840]  Alright, I'm back!
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.480]  This shit's about to get hard.
[13:52.180 --> 13:53.700]  Why did I put vines on that?
[13:53.740 --> 13:54.300]  What did that do?
[13:55.220 --> 13:57.200]  So if you put vines on a thing,
[13:57.240 --> 13:59.360]  it helps stick it, so you can, like,
[13:59.380 --> 14:00.120]  create different shapes.
[14:00.540 --> 14:01.660]  It stabilizes it.
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.460]  I probably shot... blew my load there.
[14:04.460 --> 14:06.080]  Nice. Wait.
[14:06.640 --> 14:07.180]  Uh-oh!
[14:07.860 --> 14:08.680]  Never mind.
[14:10.200 --> 14:12.660]  I bet I could...
[14:12.660 --> 14:13.100]  Woof.
[14:13.460 --> 14:13.860]  No!
[14:16.180 --> 14:16.880]  Great.
[14:18.040 --> 14:19.440]  Great use, Andrew.
[14:20.220 --> 14:22.320]  No, you're such a...
[14:23.400 --> 14:25.880]  Is this a faulty tower situation, Gavin?
[14:26.420 --> 14:28.740]  One. Oh, definitely, but...
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.880]  I think I won with that, unfortunately.
[14:33.320 --> 14:34.040]  What do you mean?
[14:34.600 --> 14:36.100]  I won the whole thing?
[14:36.280 --> 14:37.660]  You guys are dumber than me?
[14:38.240 --> 14:40.400]  Oh my god. That's terrible.
[14:41.480 --> 14:42.460]  Alright, I want to be clear.
[14:42.560 --> 14:44.960]  I was in here for, like, you know, 70% of that.
[14:45.620 --> 14:46.320]  But hey, now you're here.
[14:46.640 --> 14:47.640]  Is there a reason for that?
[14:48.440 --> 14:48.660]  Yeah.
[14:50.380 --> 14:51.440]  Yeah, I made names.
[14:56.740 --> 14:57.540]  You fucker.
[14:58.040 --> 15:00.700]  Oh, why?
[15:00.700 --> 15:01.560]  Why would you do that?
[15:02.260 --> 15:04.420]  Yeah, I'm figuring out the powers. I'm locked in now.
[15:04.980 --> 15:07.360]  Alright, I synced the video, and we're live.
[15:07.640 --> 15:07.760]  What?
[15:07.940 --> 15:09.760]  What do you know about the powers, Andrew?
[15:10.960 --> 15:12.640]  Uh, the vines attach.
[15:14.100 --> 15:14.500]  The...
[15:15.180 --> 15:16.800]  lightning gets rid of the piece
[15:16.800 --> 15:18.460]  that you just placed, I believe.
[15:18.960 --> 15:19.260]  Oh.
[15:22.460 --> 15:26.000]  I only know that the vines are good, and I like them.
[15:26.880 --> 15:29.140]  Hold Y, it lets you go up again.
[15:29.880 --> 15:30.840]  Raise the piece.
[15:31.680 --> 15:32.160]  What?
[15:32.940 --> 15:34.060]  Yeah, if you hold Y.
[15:36.300 --> 15:37.380]  It's amazing what holding Y
[15:37.380 --> 15:38.000]  will do for you.
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.920]  I'm not ever going to hold Y ever again.
[15:43.140 --> 15:44.780]  It was so funny.
[15:45.120 --> 15:46.500]  It was so fucking funny.
[15:51.240 --> 15:52.380]  Why is my tower
[15:52.380 --> 15:53.900]  getting ugly when nothing's happened yet?
[15:54.460 --> 15:54.800]  Yeah.
[15:55.880 --> 15:57.940]  Those are stuck together, so that's good.
[16:02.300 --> 16:04.560]  Get some structural integrity going.
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.140]  Oh, I need some more on this end.
[16:07.860 --> 16:08.620]  Uh-oh.
[16:09.140 --> 16:10.400]  Oh, I don't like this.
[16:10.860 --> 16:14.360]  Oh, I should have weighted that side down more.
[16:15.780 --> 16:17.000]  Ooh, here.
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.520]  Wow, look at Eric's tower. Damn.
[16:20.020 --> 16:21.740]  No, I just missed it!
[16:22.080 --> 16:24.220]  It just rolled me off.
[16:24.520 --> 16:25.340]  Fuck! No!
[16:26.620 --> 16:27.120]  Oh, what the?
[16:27.680 --> 16:27.700]  No!
[16:27.700 --> 16:29.240]  Why'd you give me a shed?
[16:29.680 --> 16:30.200]  Anchor point.
[16:30.520 --> 16:31.920]  Oh, no.
[16:35.740 --> 16:37.800]  I'm going to kill you.
[16:38.340 --> 16:39.220]  Oh, no, Nick!
[16:40.960 --> 16:41.560]  Shrubs!
[16:42.060 --> 16:43.060]  What happened? Shrubs!
[16:43.200 --> 16:44.700]  What the fuck?
[16:44.760 --> 16:46.960]  What does the shrubs do?
[16:47.520 --> 16:48.120]  What's the shrubs?
[16:49.280 --> 16:49.880]  No!
[16:50.680 --> 16:52.760]  Oh, you can't see.
[16:52.860 --> 16:53.720]  Lean! Lean!
[16:54.480 --> 16:55.320]  To lean.
[16:55.780 --> 16:57.140]  Oh my god. Oh, I need this.
[16:57.560 --> 16:58.560]  Yes! No!
[17:00.200 --> 17:00.840]  Stability.
[17:01.200 --> 17:01.420]  Stability!
[17:02.780 --> 17:05.260]  You know what? Lucky than good.
[17:06.540 --> 17:07.860]  Oh, how did that? What happened?
[17:09.620 --> 17:11.100]  What am I doing?
[17:12.760 --> 17:13.340]  What am I?
[17:14.080 --> 17:14.340]  No!
[17:15.800 --> 17:17.320]  Guys, I'm falling apart.
[17:17.940 --> 17:18.300]  No!
[17:18.820 --> 17:20.460]  What is this?
[17:20.460 --> 17:21.680]  It's a windmill!
[17:22.340 --> 17:23.100]  A windmill!
[17:24.060 --> 17:24.560]  No, a balloon!
[17:26.680 --> 17:27.780]  Fuck out of here, balloon.
[17:27.940 --> 17:29.980]  My shit just went.
[17:30.400 --> 17:31.420]  Oh my god.
[17:33.140 --> 17:34.500]  Hold together!
[17:34.940 --> 17:36.800]  Okay, we're doing alright.
[17:37.080 --> 17:38.340]  My failures are affecting
[17:38.340 --> 17:39.540]  my previous victories.
[17:40.220 --> 17:41.140]  Locking in.
[17:41.500 --> 17:43.400]  Full balls.
[17:44.240 --> 17:44.940]  Can't lose.
[17:44.940 --> 17:45.960]  Oh.
[17:50.100 --> 17:51.020]  Oh, boys.
[17:51.260 --> 17:51.760]  Oh, boys.
[17:52.020 --> 17:52.600]  Oh, boys.
[17:53.260 --> 17:53.920]  Hold!
[17:56.360 --> 17:57.020]  Yeah!
[17:58.320 --> 18:00.360]  Did I at least get second?
[18:01.760 --> 18:02.700]  I was just trying to
[18:02.700 --> 18:03.380]  hold that second.
[18:04.780 --> 18:05.260]  Damn.
[18:05.980 --> 18:07.220]  Rough trade.
[18:08.400 --> 18:09.040]  Yeah!
[18:10.380 --> 18:12.080]  Take that, Gavin!
[18:12.500 --> 18:13.160]  I got nothing.
[18:13.160 --> 18:14.420]  Yeah, you suck.
[18:17.840 --> 18:19.060]  You're worse than me.
[18:19.220 --> 18:19.680]  That's a bummer.
[18:24.040 --> 18:25.340]  Not like that!
[18:27.120 --> 18:28.980]  I don't know if I like what I did there.
[18:30.100 --> 18:31.280]  How do you get stuff to
[18:31.280 --> 18:32.580]  stay like that?
[18:33.160 --> 18:33.300]  Okay.
[18:36.200 --> 18:36.680]  Alright.
[18:41.350 --> 18:42.750]  Do I want to do that?
[18:43.970 --> 18:44.530]  Guess?
[18:47.810 --> 18:48.830]  Is this gonna tip
[18:48.830 --> 18:50.070]  the whole thing?
[18:51.190 --> 18:52.070]  I don't want to do that.
[18:52.210 --> 18:53.170]  What a schmuck hole.
[18:57.400 --> 18:57.960]  Whoops!
[18:58.660 --> 18:59.040]  You!
[19:00.120 --> 19:00.680]  Twat!
[19:05.280 --> 19:06.580]  Oh, shit. Stop.
[19:07.100 --> 19:08.580]  Well, that's the last one.
[19:08.640 --> 19:08.880]  No!
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.520]  Let's see. Don't slide.
[19:12.820 --> 19:14.420]  Don't slide. Don't fall.
[19:14.420 --> 19:15.220]  Stay right.
[19:15.340 --> 19:19.280]  Oh, man.
[19:20.740 --> 19:21.620]  Don't slow.
[19:23.660 --> 19:26.020]  When you think you're lined up perfect
[19:26.020 --> 19:27.640]  and it doesn't click
[19:27.640 --> 19:30.120]  in, it is the worst feeling.
[19:30.940 --> 19:32.240]  Like, truly the worst feeling.
[19:32.340 --> 19:34.460]  It makes me feel like I really did something wrong
[19:34.460 --> 19:35.800]  but I didn't expect it.
[19:36.120 --> 19:37.700]  So, I found out there's a button.
[19:37.980 --> 19:39.900]  If you hit right bumper or left bumper,
[19:40.080 --> 19:41.200]  it's called nudge.
[19:41.200 --> 19:43.640]  It sends it in that direction
[19:43.640 --> 19:45.420]  hard and I think it's for
[19:45.420 --> 19:47.280]  moving your pieces, clearing
[19:47.280 --> 19:48.700]  your pieces out of the way.
[19:49.140 --> 19:49.720]  I see.
[19:52.480 --> 19:55.600]  I think Gavin has me beat
[19:55.600 --> 19:57.200]  if he can hang this one.
[20:03.000 --> 20:04.720]  Alright. Daddy wins.
[20:05.960 --> 20:07.160]  What a turn!
[20:08.860 --> 20:09.240]  Oh!
[20:10.700 --> 20:11.080]  No!
[20:11.880 --> 20:12.260]  Nine.
[20:14.180 --> 20:15.160]  That's really nice,
[20:15.280 --> 20:15.360]  Eric.
[20:17.300 --> 20:18.960]  Why are you in this when you could have done
[20:18.960 --> 20:19.820]  structural engineering?
[20:21.380 --> 20:23.140]  Because I'm not smart enough to do this
[20:23.140 --> 20:25.120]  or that. But you just did that.
[20:25.800 --> 20:27.120]  Yeah, and it's a miracle.
[20:27.280 --> 20:28.700]  By the grace of God, I did that.
[20:29.380 --> 20:30.620]  By the grace of God, go thee.
[20:31.040 --> 20:31.320]  Or thy?
[20:32.780 --> 20:33.440]  Go I.
[20:33.440 --> 20:33.480]  Okay.
[20:34.540 --> 20:36.540]  What are we doing in this one again?
[20:36.620 --> 20:38.500]  Don't die. It's just surviving.
[20:38.940 --> 20:39.420]  Survive.
[20:41.940 --> 20:43.420]  Oh, no.
[20:44.220 --> 20:45.300]  Well, bad.
[20:45.680 --> 20:46.580]  Bad so far.
[20:47.200 --> 20:48.400]  Bad so far.
[20:48.960 --> 20:51.200]  I don't want that. I'll make it work.
[20:53.160 --> 20:54.980]  Oh, I already lost a life, boys.
[20:56.540 --> 20:57.560]  Oh, I don't like
[20:57.560 --> 20:57.980]  that either.
[20:58.980 --> 21:00.960]  Stop giving me these swelving Zs.
[21:00.960 --> 21:02.380]  I just lost a second life, boys.
[21:02.500 --> 21:03.880]  It looks like somebody else has taken this one.
[21:04.120 --> 21:06.280]  And there goes Eric. End of his run.
[21:07.180 --> 21:08.480]  A miracle run for Eric.
[21:09.140 --> 21:09.440]  What?
[21:10.240 --> 21:10.760]  Sausage.
[21:13.020 --> 21:13.980]  Tasty sausage.
[21:15.120 --> 21:17.140]  The vines are good,
[21:17.500 --> 21:19.260]  but I can't quite figure out
[21:19.260 --> 21:22.000]  the best use.
[21:22.960 --> 21:24.880]  Gavin, I think where you're about to set that
[21:24.880 --> 21:26.660]  and it holding all those
[21:26.660 --> 21:28.820]  is key
[21:28.820 --> 21:30.720]  to continuing to build high.
[21:32.180 --> 21:33.160]  I think. No!
[21:33.660 --> 21:35.060]  I'd love more vines then.
[21:36.820 --> 21:38.060]  Vines are really strong.
[21:38.140 --> 21:39.040]  I think vines
[21:40.040 --> 21:41.460]  are really, really good.
[21:41.580 --> 21:43.240]  Oh, you just fucked that, didn't you?
[21:44.040 --> 21:45.900]  He only has one more life.
[21:46.000 --> 21:47.960]  And so do you, you dunce.
[21:48.180 --> 21:48.860]  Gavin, no!
[21:49.140 --> 21:49.680]  It's done.
[21:51.660 --> 21:52.160]  Yeah!
[21:53.760 --> 21:55.280]  How did you do that?
[21:55.280 --> 21:56.220]  I choked.
[21:56.600 --> 21:58.580]  Yes, you did!
[21:59.060 --> 22:00.840]  Okay, I was gonna say
[22:00.840 --> 22:01.980]  zero points.
[22:02.380 --> 22:05.380]  I can't not just undo all my work.
[22:05.540 --> 22:07.260]  I'd be better off sometimes doing nothing.
[22:07.860 --> 22:08.780]  Jack the Stripper just
[22:09.160 --> 22:09.920]  threw it all away.
[22:10.700 --> 22:11.540]  Jack the Stripper?
[22:12.340 --> 22:13.080]  Yeah, it's a pretty good name.
[22:18.680 --> 22:22.320]  Oh no! Well, it's already over.
[22:22.660 --> 22:24.020]  It's already done.
[22:27.240 --> 22:28.440]  Oh, maybe not.
[22:31.420 --> 22:32.780]  What happened?
[22:33.180 --> 22:34.900]  Why did that happen?
[22:39.520 --> 22:41.040]  Come on!
[22:42.300 --> 22:44.440]  I could squeeze it there.
[22:44.840 --> 22:46.780]  Alright, so if I do this here,
[22:47.120 --> 22:47.880]  what happens to this?
[22:48.160 --> 22:50.180]  I thought... No!
[22:52.460 --> 22:54.320]  I bet this'll work.
[22:55.380 --> 22:56.340]  Oh, it did.
[22:57.800 --> 22:58.440]  How do I
[22:58.440 --> 22:59.780]  bunce all my
[23:00.360 --> 23:02.200]  busted shit out of the way?
[23:02.400 --> 23:03.800]  There we go.
[23:04.180 --> 23:04.760]  That's out.
[23:05.060 --> 23:07.700]  Oh no.
[23:09.360 --> 23:10.240]  That's a risk.
[23:11.240 --> 23:12.240]  I think Nick
[23:12.240 --> 23:13.280]  has me beat on this one.
[23:14.920 --> 23:15.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:15.960 --> 23:17.720]  I think you got a good run going, dude.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.680]  You even have your vines still? You haven't used your vines?
[23:20.880 --> 23:21.940]  What? There's vines?
[23:22.140 --> 23:22.700]  Oh shit!
[23:22.700 --> 23:24.620]  You have a little power,
[23:24.800 --> 23:25.020]  bud.
[23:25.640 --> 23:28.800]  When you place this, it's gonna grab
[23:28.800 --> 23:30.920]  everything around it, and I think those
[23:30.920 --> 23:32.920]  essentially act as one piece
[23:32.920 --> 23:33.200]  now.
[23:34.500 --> 23:36.900]  I think that's how
[23:36.900 --> 23:37.540]  vines work.
[23:41.920 --> 23:42.740]  Yeah, Nick,
[23:42.820 --> 23:43.920]  that is strong, dude.
[23:44.340 --> 23:46.200]  That's pretty sweet. Yeah, that was really good.
[23:49.280 --> 23:50.240]  We're locked in.
[23:53.980 --> 23:54.500]  Andrew's
[23:54.500 --> 23:55.220]  pretty good.
[23:56.140 --> 23:58.940]  You wanted it too bad. It moves you up.
[24:00.120 --> 24:00.320]  Oh, wow.
[24:00.400 --> 24:02.620]  He could get something here. Oh, Andrew might
[24:02.620 --> 24:03.420]  take this one.
[24:04.260 --> 24:06.440]  Is he gonna get guts or glory?
[24:06.540 --> 24:07.840]  Where are you putting it? Guts.
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.100]  Do you have it? No!
[24:09.480 --> 24:11.660]  I panicked.
[24:12.360 --> 24:13.700]  Do you have it?
[24:16.740 --> 24:17.620]  Strong third.
[24:19.520 --> 24:20.560]  Whoa, Nick!
[24:20.560 --> 24:22.520]  Way to go! Nice tower, Nick.
[24:22.680 --> 24:23.100]  Thank you!
[24:24.200 --> 24:25.740]  That was really, really strong.
[24:26.300 --> 24:27.900]  Oh, you deleted that!
[24:28.560 --> 24:30.700]  Alright, we're not stopping the stream until I win.
[24:31.700 --> 24:32.600]  We have stuff
[24:32.600 --> 24:33.260]  to do later.
[24:35.200 --> 24:36.640]  I have a life to get back to.
[24:37.500 --> 24:37.860]  We do?
[24:45.620 --> 24:46.580]  Oh, I'm
[24:46.580 --> 24:47.680]  loving what I'm building here.
[24:50.940 --> 24:52.540]  I think Nick choked
[24:52.540 --> 24:54.140]  literally. Are you alright, Nick?
[24:54.720 --> 24:56.420]  That was the worst hiccup in the world.
[24:56.440 --> 24:56.640]  No!
[25:00.420 --> 25:04.560]  Okay, I need to get fucking...
[25:05.640 --> 25:06.520]  The hiccup
[25:06.520 --> 25:07.500]  looked like it sounded like a hiccup.
[25:07.820 --> 25:09.440]  Oh, dude, it hurts so bad.
[25:09.740 --> 25:12.260]  I just did the nudge thing, and it fixed
[25:12.260 --> 25:13.000]  everything.
[25:13.980 --> 25:16.640]  I think that's the pro strats
[25:16.640 --> 25:17.820]  move. I think it's the nudge.
[25:19.940 --> 25:20.400]  No!
[25:20.600 --> 25:21.240]  Oh, no.
[25:21.440 --> 25:22.600]  That was me. What'd it do?
[25:22.880 --> 25:24.680]  No, it's wiggling all over the place.
[25:25.600 --> 25:26.480]  Oh, fuck that.
[25:27.040 --> 25:27.920]  Is that good or bad?
[25:28.640 --> 25:30.400]  No, I didn't like it at all.
[25:32.400 --> 25:34.000]  It really, it really,
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  it really porked me good.
[25:36.400 --> 25:38.000]  Dude, nudging rules.
[25:39.260 --> 25:39.720]  What?
[25:40.180 --> 25:41.100]  It porked him good.
[25:43.180 --> 25:43.780]  I thought
[25:43.780 --> 25:44.560]  it was very clear.
[25:44.560 --> 25:44.860]  Yeah.
[25:46.240 --> 25:48.600]  Nick, I'm so glad that we got to
[25:48.600 --> 25:49.420]  start companies together.
[25:50.280 --> 25:52.240]  It's so great. I love it.
[25:52.420 --> 25:53.560]  It makes me so happy.
[25:53.900 --> 25:54.500]  Me too, man.
[25:58.160 --> 25:58.560]  No!
[25:58.980 --> 26:00.340]  You know what? This is a good anchor point.
[26:00.400 --> 26:00.980]  Thank you.
[26:02.260 --> 26:03.160]  Oh, shit. No, it wasn't.
[26:03.660 --> 26:06.440]  No! The fucking
[26:06.440 --> 26:07.020]  piano!
[26:09.540 --> 26:10.620]  That's for all you guys.
[26:10.660 --> 26:12.280]  What the fuck is that? What is shrubs?
[26:12.280 --> 26:12.900]  They're shrubs.
[26:13.280 --> 26:16.100]  The shrubs shrubbed on my shite. What just happened?
[26:16.240 --> 26:16.900]  They shrubbed a dub.
[26:17.080 --> 26:19.660]  I think it's just like you can't see so good.
[26:19.780 --> 26:21.380]  Yeah. Have fun.
[26:22.300 --> 26:22.560]  Okay.
[26:22.940 --> 26:23.660]  Oh, no!
[26:24.380 --> 26:25.120]  Oh, no!
[26:28.700 --> 26:29.660]  Fuck me.
[26:31.240 --> 26:32.120]  Oh, no.
[26:32.240 --> 26:34.240]  Don't fall, you little son of a gun.
[26:34.520 --> 26:34.800]  No!
[26:37.440 --> 26:38.220]  Oh, my
[26:38.220 --> 26:38.960]  fricking
[26:39.980 --> 26:40.580]  God.
[26:40.700 --> 26:41.640]  Oh, shit.
[26:43.100 --> 26:44.260]  Go shrub yourself.
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.980]  That is a mad shrubbing I just
[26:46.980 --> 26:47.760]  was given there.
[26:48.580 --> 26:51.180]  Oh, fuck. The shrubs do nothing.
[26:52.220 --> 26:53.220]  My eyes,
[26:53.320 --> 26:54.380]  the goggles do nothing.
[26:56.140 --> 26:56.540]  Uh-oh.
[26:57.200 --> 26:57.720]  Goodbye, tower.
[26:59.480 --> 26:59.720]  Ugh.
[27:00.660 --> 27:02.300]  You weren't tricky enough.
[27:02.860 --> 27:03.080]  Oh.
[27:05.900 --> 27:07.100]  Come on.
[27:07.800 --> 27:08.400]  Oh,
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.060]  I'm in a hell of my own
[27:11.060 --> 27:11.480]  making.
[27:12.920 --> 27:14.840]  No. I'm doing that stuff.
[27:14.980 --> 27:16.840]  I need to win.
[27:17.260 --> 27:18.300]  Hold, hold.
[27:18.820 --> 27:20.560]  Yes, yes, yes.
[27:20.580 --> 27:21.300]  Please end it.
[27:22.320 --> 27:22.920]  No!
[27:24.040 --> 27:26.860]  Oh, that was so bad.
[27:27.540 --> 27:27.640]  Oh.
[27:30.040 --> 27:31.200]  I just fell.
[27:31.340 --> 27:32.800]  Guys, I fell apart.
[27:33.020 --> 27:34.300]  I just fell apart.
[27:34.880 --> 27:36.280]  I was down here at the
[27:36.280 --> 27:37.900]  bottom with Gavin. What does that say?
[27:39.140 --> 27:40.080]  Did not get a second?
[27:40.900 --> 27:42.460]  Well, you got the most seconds,
[27:42.560 --> 27:43.060]  I think.
[27:44.460 --> 27:45.940]  Which put you in fourth.
[27:46.560 --> 27:48.020]  Oh, you mean the whole thing. Yeah, yeah.
[27:48.140 --> 27:51.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:51.780 --> 27:52.380]  Alright, this is
[27:52.380 --> 27:53.620]  my round now.
[27:53.860 --> 27:54.920]  I know the rules.
[27:57.500 --> 27:58.380]  You're a nudging
[27:58.380 --> 27:59.060]  guy now, huh?
[27:59.800 --> 28:01.640]  Oh, you gotta nudge. Trust me.
[28:01.640 --> 28:03.360]  Nudge makes a huge difference.
[28:03.680 --> 28:05.640]  Now, how are you using nudge?
[28:05.940 --> 28:07.800]  I was just mashing right bumper
[28:07.800 --> 28:09.700]  to try to get a piece off that I
[28:09.700 --> 28:11.680]  fucked up previous, and it just
[28:11.680 --> 28:13.340]  slotted everything into place.
[28:13.460 --> 28:15.620]  It fixed all of my fuck-ups.
[28:15.960 --> 28:16.700]  Right in the slot.
[28:17.540 --> 28:19.140]  Right in the slot.
[28:23.340 --> 28:24.900]  Ah, I hate it when they do that.
[28:24.980 --> 28:26.180]  I lost a life there. That's great.
[28:27.160 --> 28:28.420]  Oh, but that's probably an anchor.
[28:29.200 --> 28:29.360]  Yeah.
[28:30.760 --> 28:31.320]  Nudge.
[28:31.540 --> 28:33.240]  Oh, that's pretty.
[28:33.500 --> 28:35.500]  Look at that.
[28:39.700 --> 28:41.460]  I keep putting myself
[28:41.460 --> 28:43.160]  in corners with the
[28:43.160 --> 28:44.420]  decisions I make.
[28:45.220 --> 28:47.300]  Hey, if you're watching this live, thanks
[28:47.300 --> 28:48.760]  for the betting, and
[28:49.340 --> 28:51.300]  it's fun to watch live, but thanks
[28:51.300 --> 28:52.340]  to everyone watching, too.
[28:53.080 --> 28:54.540]  Appreciate all the subs.
[28:54.980 --> 28:56.640]  Oh, someone's fogged me.
[28:56.640 --> 28:57.840]  I've got the fog.
[28:58.220 --> 29:00.860]  Oh, fog! What is happening?
[29:01.260 --> 29:02.220]  What does the chain do?
[29:02.420 --> 29:02.940]  No mercy.
[29:03.660 --> 29:06.220]  I think maybe it means I can't flip it, but thankfully
[29:06.220 --> 29:06.940]  I had a square.
[29:12.640 --> 29:14.060]  If anyone is
[29:14.060 --> 29:16.460]  cheering for me, I deeply apologize.
[29:20.280 --> 29:21.880]  It does rarely happen, and
[29:21.880 --> 29:24.380]  I disappoint people quite a lot.
[29:24.380 --> 29:26.100]  What I just did!
[29:26.260 --> 29:28.560]  That! Okay. That was cool.
[29:31.560 --> 29:33.380]  Stay alive. Stay alive.
[29:33.640 --> 29:35.300]  There you go, fellas.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  Oh, I missed it?
[29:40.040 --> 29:41.860]  Oh, why did I just stone myself?
[29:44.700 --> 29:45.800]  Oh, this is bad.
[29:46.480 --> 29:47.260]  I, uh...
[29:48.160 --> 29:49.960]  may have flown too close to the sun.
[29:51.760 --> 29:52.280]  Shit.
[29:53.440 --> 29:54.040]  Hold.
[29:54.420 --> 29:55.580]  Oh, Icarus, you bitch.
[29:59.400 --> 30:00.940]  Oh, look at that.
[30:02.620 --> 30:06.120]  Oh, I need... yeah, let's do this.
[30:07.180 --> 30:07.720]  Oh, that's
[30:07.720 --> 30:08.040]  foolish.
[30:10.120 --> 30:11.480]  Oh, shit. Goodbye.
[30:12.540 --> 30:14.860]  No, my whole team!
[30:18.740 --> 30:19.340]  Gavin!
[30:19.340 --> 30:20.060]  Gavin!
[30:21.280 --> 30:22.660]  Gavin, you said this was yours.
[30:23.500 --> 30:23.540]  Yay!
[30:25.180 --> 30:27.200]  Wow, that's a really nice
[30:27.200 --> 30:27.680]  looking tower.
[30:30.800 --> 30:32.980]  Oh, I'm on the Gavin second train.
[30:37.180 --> 30:39.060]  Oh, man. Oh, I'm gonna win this.
[30:39.720 --> 30:41.260]  This is exactly gonna be like
[30:41.260 --> 30:42.920]  the puzzle piece race that we're doing.
[30:43.700 --> 30:44.320]  I got this.
[30:44.800 --> 30:46.660]  How do I wanna do this?
[30:48.220 --> 30:49.720]  Oh, I got this.
[30:49.780 --> 30:50.040]  Yeah.
[30:50.780 --> 30:51.860]  Got an idea.
[30:57.060 --> 30:58.580]  Will that work?
[30:59.640 --> 31:00.780]  Only just.
[31:07.560 --> 31:08.200]  Nope.
[31:09.240 --> 31:10.980]  Could try that.
[31:13.020 --> 31:15.600]  I wanna see if this works the way I think it might.
[31:17.080 --> 31:18.820]  Alright, get ready for some zoom.
[31:18.820 --> 31:20.280]  Nope, doesn't. Okay.
[31:20.720 --> 31:22.880]  I now understand how things work.
[31:23.500 --> 31:25.260]  Oh, I'm so gonna lose this.
[31:25.680 --> 31:29.080]  This is not good, not good, not good.
[31:29.140 --> 31:30.900]  I can't have anything fall if I do this.
[31:31.260 --> 31:32.540]  Okay, well, that's the end of me.
[31:33.200 --> 31:34.340]  Okay, let's see how I did.
[31:35.100 --> 31:36.280]  That's the end of me.
[31:38.940 --> 31:40.040]  Solidly middle, I think.
[31:41.020 --> 31:42.160]  Oh, I can do this.
[31:44.380 --> 31:46.320]  Oh, what a move, Nick!
[31:46.320 --> 31:47.280]  Did you see that shit?
[31:47.860 --> 31:50.000]  Wow, that was phenomenal, dude.
[31:50.100 --> 31:51.460]  That was really great.
[31:51.800 --> 31:53.200]  I'm super impressed.
[31:53.720 --> 31:55.020]  That was fucking awesome.
[31:55.860 --> 31:58.080]  Oh, Nick, be careful.
[31:58.200 --> 31:58.420]  No!
[31:59.360 --> 32:00.060]  Oh, no!
[32:01.880 --> 32:03.360]  You might have just fucked yourself.
[32:03.520 --> 32:05.840]  I sure did. I got cocky.
[32:07.280 --> 32:08.140]  Fucking A.
[32:08.340 --> 32:08.820]  Oh!
[32:09.860 --> 32:11.060]  Daddy wins again.
[32:11.160 --> 32:11.940]  I had it!
[32:11.940 --> 32:14.380]  You're a puzzle guy now, Eric, apparently.
[32:14.480 --> 32:15.020]  No, I'm not.
[32:16.360 --> 32:18.060]  Eric's the biggest board game guy
[32:18.060 --> 32:18.800]  we've ever had.
[32:21.740 --> 32:22.220]  Race!
[32:22.860 --> 32:24.900]  Okay, I'm gonna get to the fucking top so quick.
[32:26.480 --> 32:27.960]  I think Eric
[32:27.960 --> 32:28.680]  is secretly
[32:29.940 --> 32:31.500]  a board game guy.
[32:31.620 --> 32:33.720]  He just likes to deflect to the point where
[32:33.720 --> 32:35.540]  people don't want to get him to do it.
[32:35.740 --> 32:37.460]  And he gets other people to play instead.
[32:37.640 --> 32:39.740]  I would love if we never played board games.
[32:39.740 --> 32:41.420]  It would make my whole life.
[32:41.480 --> 32:42.500]  It would be really phenomenal.
[32:42.800 --> 32:44.520]  Don't you just want to make him play one?
[32:46.960 --> 32:47.320]  Don't.
[32:47.820 --> 32:48.540]  Please don't.
[32:48.760 --> 32:50.300]  I don't know how to be more clear.
[32:51.020 --> 32:52.800]  They're a part of your personality now, Eric.
[32:52.880 --> 32:54.020]  I hate it.
[32:54.220 --> 32:55.720]  Message received, Eric. We'll do it.
[32:58.780 --> 32:59.500]  Message received.
[33:00.640 --> 33:01.580]  We hear what you're saying.
[33:01.660 --> 33:02.120]  Loud and clear.
[33:03.080 --> 33:03.840]  Yeah, dude, I got you.
[33:10.310 --> 33:10.930]  I'm in third.
[33:10.930 --> 33:11.810]  I better hurry up.
[33:13.830 --> 33:14.710]  Uh oh.
[33:14.970 --> 33:15.310]  Gamble.
[33:16.990 --> 33:17.730]  Nice.
[33:18.110 --> 33:20.990]  A nice, smooth, robust tower
[33:20.990 --> 33:22.150]  all the way up.
[33:22.510 --> 33:23.150]  Come on now.
[33:24.890 --> 33:25.930]  Have a bubble.
[33:26.730 --> 33:27.490]  Oh, that bubble
[33:27.490 --> 33:29.830]  might have saved me.
[33:30.850 --> 33:31.590]  It might have saved you?
[33:34.910 --> 33:36.390]  That bubble
[33:36.390 --> 33:38.950]  is going to ruin my tower.
[33:38.950 --> 33:40.850]  Oh, no! Not another
[33:40.850 --> 33:42.530]  fucking balloon.
[33:46.330 --> 33:47.130]  I ate shit, fellas.
[33:47.210 --> 33:48.670]  Stop taking my block!
[33:48.810 --> 33:50.630]  No, no, no. Spin. Spin again.
[33:50.730 --> 33:51.410]  Spin again. No!
[33:52.570 --> 33:53.890]  Don't fall. Bastard man.
[33:55.290 --> 33:56.330]  You're a bastard.
[33:56.770 --> 33:57.610]  Oh, no.
[33:58.450 --> 33:58.930]  No!
[34:00.070 --> 34:01.810]  No, I can't. No!
[34:03.750 --> 34:04.710]  Oh, my God.
[34:05.970 --> 34:06.790]  What the hell
[34:06.790 --> 34:08.930]  is this? What does this power do?
[34:08.930 --> 34:10.950]  Oh, it makes it icy.
[34:12.010 --> 34:13.530]  It's a little chilly.
[34:15.090 --> 34:16.970]  Stop making it
[34:16.970 --> 34:17.630]  a little chilly.
[34:18.550 --> 34:21.030]  How long is it going to be chilly for?
[34:21.170 --> 34:22.430]  It's cold as ice.
[34:24.710 --> 34:26.190]  The piano.
[34:27.570 --> 34:28.410]  You...
[34:30.710 --> 34:31.550]  No!
[34:34.690 --> 34:36.230]  Oh, what the fuck?
[34:36.230 --> 34:37.710]  Get the balloon out of here!
[34:38.990 --> 34:39.950]  I can't
[34:39.950 --> 34:41.650]  allow it. Damn you.
[34:41.810 --> 34:43.670]  You son of a bitch. Oh, my God.
[34:43.710 --> 34:45.210]  It fucked me so bad.
[34:45.290 --> 34:48.050]  Oh, it fucked me so bad.
[34:48.170 --> 34:50.190]  No, don't fall. Don't fall. No!
[34:50.930 --> 34:51.890]  Damn it.
[34:52.030 --> 34:52.510]  No!
[34:54.370 --> 34:54.850]  No!
[34:56.750 --> 34:56.990]  No!
[35:00.510 --> 35:01.850]  Act as one piece. Hang on. Yes.
[35:02.490 --> 35:03.430]  That's not good.
[35:03.430 --> 35:05.550]  That's not good. Why would you think that's good?
[35:07.350 --> 35:08.850]  Who thinks what's good? Me.
[35:09.050 --> 35:10.210]  Thought that good? No.
[35:12.530 --> 35:13.050]  Fuck
[35:13.050 --> 35:13.810]  me.
[35:14.010 --> 35:16.970]  What am I supposed to do?
[35:17.510 --> 35:18.530]  Oh, no!
[35:20.690 --> 35:21.450]  I've lost
[35:21.450 --> 35:21.990]  so much health.
[35:22.230 --> 35:24.270]  Oh, my God.
[35:26.030 --> 35:27.510]  I've lost everything.
[35:30.110 --> 35:30.590]  Oh,
[35:31.310 --> 35:31.790]  no!
[35:32.490 --> 35:32.970]  Yes!
[35:34.550 --> 35:35.030]  Woohoo!
[35:35.370 --> 35:37.010]  Daddy wins again, baby.
[35:41.690 --> 35:44.150]  I was going for a wrecking ball.
[35:44.170 --> 35:45.870]  That's what I'm talking about. That's first place.
[35:45.970 --> 35:47.350]  Hell, yeah. First and first and first.
[35:47.430 --> 35:48.550]  I guess I'll just keep winning, baby.
[35:49.370 --> 35:51.210]  Easy money. Okay.
[35:51.810 --> 35:52.630]  What was this one?
[35:53.190 --> 35:54.770]  Don't die. A puzzle?
[35:54.770 --> 35:57.110]  Get as many pieces as you can.
[36:05.780 --> 36:07.180]  That was a mistake.
[36:07.580 --> 36:09.360]  Oh, no. So bad.
[36:09.580 --> 36:10.460]  Oh, no.
[36:12.340 --> 36:13.920]  Oh, so bad.
[36:14.080 --> 36:15.780]  Boys are back
[36:15.780 --> 36:17.820]  in town. This is not good.
[36:18.440 --> 36:19.060]  Fellas.
[36:20.440 --> 36:21.820]  Oh, no.
[36:22.220 --> 36:22.880]  No!
[36:25.200 --> 36:27.180]  How did that not stay?
[36:29.660 --> 36:30.140]  Stay!
[36:31.280 --> 36:31.640]  Stay!
[36:33.740 --> 36:35.200]  Fine. Whatever. Finish.
[36:35.560 --> 36:36.880]  Just get done. This is stupid.
[36:37.260 --> 36:39.680]  This is a dumb game for fucking
[36:39.680 --> 36:41.600]  babies. Oh, Gavin, not a
[36:41.600 --> 36:43.560]  good idea. Gavin, what are you doing?
[36:44.260 --> 36:44.460]  Whoops.
[36:46.160 --> 36:47.580]  What do you mean, whoops?
[36:48.240 --> 36:48.600]  Nope.
[36:48.960 --> 36:50.860]  What the fuck was that?
[36:52.040 --> 36:53.920]  There was nothing for it to hang on to.
[36:54.300 --> 36:55.640]  In my head, I
[36:55.640 --> 36:57.480]  vined it all, but I only vined the bit
[36:57.480 --> 36:59.180]  before that. Oh, the vines.
[37:00.340 --> 37:01.600]  Oh, you helped Nick
[37:01.600 --> 37:02.980]  again. Damn it.
[37:03.480 --> 37:05.540]  But it's gonna act as one piece, and I think it's all gonna fall.
[37:05.660 --> 37:06.580]  Watch this. No.
[37:07.700 --> 37:08.340]  Yep. Ah!
[37:11.080 --> 37:11.440]  Anyway,
[37:11.560 --> 37:11.940]  like I said.
[37:14.620 --> 37:15.420]  For Christ's sake.
[37:15.560 --> 37:17.440]  And then he just ended it.
[37:18.860 --> 37:19.380]  Just, yeah,
[37:19.500 --> 37:21.640]  just like I'm...
[37:22.640 --> 37:23.320]  Hey, guys.
[37:23.320 --> 37:24.900]  Wow. Hey, guys.
[37:26.400 --> 37:27.520]  Easy money.
[37:28.860 --> 37:31.320]  Peaks and freaks, holler if you
[37:31.320 --> 37:33.460]  hear me. I don't like
[37:33.460 --> 37:35.240]  puzzles. They're not fun.
[37:35.240 --> 37:35.500]  I don't.
[37:36.600 --> 37:38.440]  What happened to the crying, Eric?
[37:38.920 --> 37:40.000]  Before we started.
[37:40.340 --> 37:42.940]  When I'm in first place, it doesn't matter.
[37:44.700 --> 37:45.320]  Like, you can't
[37:45.320 --> 37:47.120]  be worse than me. That's embarrassing
[37:47.120 --> 37:48.560]  for you. That's awful.
[37:49.700 --> 37:51.220]  Have you ever met any of us?
[37:52.220 --> 37:53.340]  Yeah. Hey, wait.
[37:54.100 --> 37:54.560]  Hold on.
[37:56.960 --> 37:59.160]  Oh, that didn't work. Ah, you're such a
[37:59.160 --> 38:00.360]  stupid idiot.
[38:01.500 --> 38:02.140]  Dutz.
[38:07.230 --> 38:07.590]  No!
[38:12.440 --> 38:14.520]  This game just has me living
[38:14.520 --> 38:15.780]  in schmuck mode.
[38:16.660 --> 38:18.500]  Oh, I fixed it.
[38:20.780 --> 38:22.800]  I will kill you.
[38:22.800 --> 38:24.260]  I will kill you.
[38:24.380 --> 38:26.480]  Eat a bag of dicks.
[38:26.600 --> 38:28.080]  At least let me put it.
[38:28.180 --> 38:29.820]  What the fuck? Stop!
[38:30.440 --> 38:33.120]  No! It's too big!
[38:33.420 --> 38:34.600]  It's too fast!
[38:34.860 --> 38:36.320]  Too big, too fast.
[38:36.620 --> 38:37.040]  Stop!
[38:38.340 --> 38:40.240]  Too big, too fast, too furious.
[38:40.740 --> 38:41.760]  Fast 12.
[38:42.240 --> 38:44.880]  I'm dead! I'm dead! You killed me, you bastard!
[38:47.100 --> 38:48.500]  I was running
[38:48.500 --> 38:49.980]  away with it!
[38:49.980 --> 38:52.100]  It was so easy!
[38:52.480 --> 38:53.480]  Oh, I got
[38:53.480 --> 38:55.300]  fucked double time!
[38:58.320 --> 39:00.000]  Guys, guys, if you're
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.900]  watching this live, drop
[39:01.900 --> 39:03.840]  a Prime sub if you support me,
[39:04.020 --> 39:05.220]  the true king of this game.
[39:05.780 --> 39:07.240]  What in the name of...
[39:07.240 --> 39:09.660]  You won, Gavin.
[39:09.840 --> 39:11.300]  How did you do that?
[39:12.540 --> 39:14.200]  Everyone fucking blew it.
[39:14.200 --> 39:14.500]  Yeah.
[39:18.900 --> 39:19.620]  Oh.
[39:20.560 --> 39:21.280]  Oh.
[39:21.700 --> 39:22.900]  My. God.
[39:23.220 --> 39:24.980]  Is this gonna be anyone's game?
[39:25.400 --> 39:27.580]  No, it's Eric's favorite game type.
[39:29.940 --> 39:31.220]  Oh, interesting.
[39:31.860 --> 39:32.580]  Interesting.
[39:39.360 --> 39:41.780]  I don't know if I played that right.
[39:43.200 --> 39:44.400]  I guess we'll find out.
[39:45.940 --> 39:47.380]  Oh, that's...
[39:52.280 --> 39:52.800]  Well...
[39:52.800 --> 39:53.340]  Oh, dear.
[39:53.620 --> 39:54.760]  Oh, bollocks.
[40:03.880 --> 40:05.560]  That did not work
[40:05.560 --> 40:06.220]  the way I was hoping.
[40:06.220 --> 40:08.780]  That's not gonna work.
[40:09.060 --> 40:11.700]  Oh, wait, but maybe...
[40:11.700 --> 40:12.000]  Okay.
[40:14.180 --> 40:14.880]  Oh, I see.
[40:15.120 --> 40:16.220]  I can't go that far out.
[40:19.580 --> 40:21.120]  Thank you, Ace Archer.
[40:21.200 --> 40:22.020]  Appreciate you guys.
[40:22.020 --> 40:23.500]  Thanks, everyone watching.
[40:24.660 --> 40:25.280]  No.
[40:27.180 --> 40:27.800]  Nick.
[40:27.840 --> 40:28.680]  I'm just gonna take it.
[40:28.680 --> 40:29.740]  That's your last one right there.
[40:31.680 --> 40:32.920]  Guys, I think...
[40:32.920 --> 40:34.600]  Gavin has zero pieces.
[40:34.920 --> 40:35.240]  How?
[40:37.040 --> 40:37.980]  Hey, guys.
[40:38.540 --> 40:39.100]  No.
[40:40.600 --> 40:42.340]  Hey, guys.
[40:42.540 --> 40:43.400]  Here's the thing.
[40:44.640 --> 40:45.260]  Wow.
[40:46.940 --> 40:47.420]  Hey, guys.
[40:47.420 --> 40:48.980]  Eric wins again.
[40:49.100 --> 40:50.940]  I don't think I've ever played a game
[40:50.940 --> 40:53.380]  that makes me like myself less.
[40:54.260 --> 40:55.400]  It's so much
[40:55.400 --> 40:56.400]  self-hating in this.
[40:56.660 --> 40:59.380]  I always have the potential to take it home.
[40:59.520 --> 41:01.080]  And I'm like England.
[41:01.180 --> 41:02.280]  It's coming home.
[41:05.250 --> 41:05.710]  Alright.
[41:06.010 --> 41:08.450]  I'm gonna go ahead and ready up. Guys, how you feeling?
[41:08.610 --> 41:10.630]  Thanks for watching. This VOD will be out Tuesday.
[41:11.390 --> 41:12.430]  Rats in the chat.
[41:12.550 --> 41:14.370]  You know who you are. Let's get this going.
[41:14.710 --> 41:16.150]  Who's won? Nick's won.
[41:16.150 --> 41:18.090]  I think I've won a few.
[41:18.270 --> 41:20.150]  I kinda like lost count of how many I've won.
[41:20.150 --> 41:20.770]  I think Eric's won twice.
[41:21.950 --> 41:22.930]  It's like a lot.
[41:23.570 --> 41:24.910]  Is that a lot though?
[41:25.030 --> 41:27.270]  He is a prick, isn't he?
[41:43.180 --> 41:44.800]  We're gonna get copyright struck.
[41:44.800 --> 41:46.400]  Na na na na na.
[41:46.840 --> 41:48.900]  You piece of stupid.
[41:49.120 --> 41:50.120]  You stupid ass.
[41:51.440 --> 41:52.980]  Dumb stupid ass.
[41:54.200 --> 41:55.100]  Nick doesn't even know
[41:55.100 --> 41:56.460]  who you're talking about, but he's gonna agree.
[41:57.000 --> 41:57.960]  Yeah. Oh.
[41:58.200 --> 41:59.700]  What are you doing?
[41:59.720 --> 42:01.860]  Oh, you have royally.
[42:03.320 --> 42:04.940]  That's it. Vengeance.
[42:05.020 --> 42:05.820]  Let me put it.
[42:06.460 --> 42:08.460]  Oh, you are having a laugh hole.
[42:08.980 --> 42:09.620]  I am laughing.
[42:12.760 --> 42:14.560]  Oh, I wish I could see anything
[42:14.560 --> 42:15.940]  that was happening.
[42:17.660 --> 42:19.100]  Oh no. Oh no.
[42:19.300 --> 42:19.940]  Lost a life.
[42:23.100 --> 42:25.080]  Oh, fuck me. What is going on?
[42:25.180 --> 42:25.920]  I'm falling apart.
[42:26.660 --> 42:27.700]  This could be worse.
[42:28.960 --> 42:29.760]  You know what?
[42:31.060 --> 42:32.000]  This could be worse.
[42:32.260 --> 42:33.000]  Oh, that's not good.
[42:35.420 --> 42:36.780]  What are you about to do?
[42:36.780 --> 42:38.940]  No, I'm just, you know.
[42:39.160 --> 42:39.420]  There you go.
[42:39.860 --> 42:41.760]  I got worse, guys.
[42:42.380 --> 42:43.320]  It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
[42:43.820 --> 42:45.340]  Guys, it got worse.
[42:47.140 --> 42:48.400]  You said that, and it happened.
[42:49.060 --> 42:49.920]  Now I deserve this.
[42:50.300 --> 42:50.940]  Oh, it's a square.
[42:54.280 --> 42:56.920]  This is too sweaty. You guys need to start losing lives.
[42:56.920 --> 42:57.980]  No, no, no, no, my pieces!
[42:59.280 --> 42:59.900]  Thanks, Eric.
[43:02.100 --> 43:02.820]  Oh, shit.
[43:03.160 --> 43:03.700]  Oh, no!
[43:03.700 --> 43:04.500]  Oh, no!
[43:05.900 --> 43:07.160]  I forgot about...
[43:07.160 --> 43:07.620]  Oh, dude.
[43:08.060 --> 43:10.960]  Andrew, that was such a good use of vines, dude.
[43:10.960 --> 43:12.540]  Oh, no, I panicked.
[43:13.720 --> 43:15.600]  Andrew, you're falling apart. You gotta slow down.
[43:15.780 --> 43:16.380]  Yep, yep.
[43:16.520 --> 43:18.400]  Andrew, you gotta slow down.
[43:19.820 --> 43:21.000]  Andrew, slow down.
[43:21.120 --> 43:21.760]  I can't!
[43:21.980 --> 43:24.340]  It's getting so fast.
[43:26.500 --> 43:28.440]  Oh, you've doomed me!
[43:28.520 --> 43:30.120]  You've absolutely doomed me!
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.780]  That was the point!
[43:33.440 --> 43:34.980]  Andrew, Andrew, Andrew!
[43:35.460 --> 43:35.920]  Andrew!
[43:37.140 --> 43:38.340]  Andrew, don't!
[43:38.380 --> 43:39.540]  Andrew, you blew it!
[43:40.400 --> 43:42.520]  Andrew, you blew it!
[43:42.880 --> 43:43.120]  Yeah!
[43:44.280 --> 43:46.360]  Why did you start getting squirrely?
[43:46.940 --> 43:48.460]  Half a second more!
[43:48.760 --> 43:51.360]  You started just throwing stuff left and right!
[43:51.720 --> 43:52.440]  Oh, I panicked.
[43:53.300 --> 43:54.880]  Oh, you had it!
[43:55.680 --> 43:56.540]  I panicked.
[43:56.980 --> 43:58.620]  Is this Gavin's game?
[43:58.620 --> 44:01.300]  When everyone gets power-ups at the exact same time,
[44:01.380 --> 44:03.380]  so I have one block that can't turn,
[44:03.660 --> 44:04.340]  gets massive,
[44:04.480 --> 44:05.380]  and covered in shite.
[44:08.740 --> 44:09.900]  Ooh, interesting.
[44:14.760 --> 44:17.140]  How do I want to play this?
[44:19.140 --> 44:21.180]  I don't like it.
[44:28.730 --> 44:29.290]  Alright.
[44:36.130 --> 44:37.430]  Lay this down.
[44:49.360 --> 44:49.780]  Well...
[44:52.900 --> 44:53.880]  God be with me.
[44:55.000 --> 44:55.420]  Yep.
[44:58.680 --> 44:59.100]  Alright.
[44:59.440 --> 45:00.280]  Let's see how I did.
[45:03.440 --> 45:04.440]  Hey, Eric, how did I do?
[45:06.940 --> 45:09.380]  You have one...
[45:09.380 --> 45:11.080]  What are you, Gavin?
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.240]  Let's just say...
[45:13.240 --> 45:14.220]  How did you do that?
[45:14.420 --> 45:15.700]  How do you have one piece?
[45:16.700 --> 45:18.320]  It, uh...
[45:18.320 --> 45:20.320]  It took everything from me.
[45:20.760 --> 45:21.840]  The vine.
[45:21.980 --> 45:24.120]  Andrew's about to dump everything on the right.
[45:29.260 --> 45:30.100]  No!
[45:30.980 --> 45:31.800]  No!
[45:32.440 --> 45:33.280]  No!
[45:33.980 --> 45:34.820]  No!
[45:36.420 --> 45:38.000]  You got so lucky
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.900]  that those two didn't fall.
[45:40.480 --> 45:40.900]  No!
[45:43.140 --> 45:43.980]  Oh!
[45:45.460 --> 45:46.900]  Puzzle guy Eric!
[45:46.900 --> 45:49.460]  Eric wins again!
[45:52.640 --> 45:53.440]  Wow, guys.
[45:55.700 --> 45:56.100]  Beautiful.
[45:56.780 --> 45:57.420]  Alright, back to the race.
[45:57.420 --> 45:58.560]  Do you believe in miracles?
[46:00.520 --> 46:01.420]  He said ice.
[46:05.700 --> 46:07.560]  You gotta get a good foundation going.
[46:07.740 --> 46:08.900]  Oh, cool, just fell. Great.
[46:09.340 --> 46:09.800]  Bad foundation.
[46:13.120 --> 46:14.100]  Increase the speed.
[46:20.840 --> 46:22.340]  Yep, didn't like that.
[46:22.340 --> 46:23.040]  Okay.
[46:23.380 --> 46:26.300]  Instantly screwed it up.
[46:26.300 --> 46:27.180]  That's not gonna work.
[46:27.660 --> 46:29.480]  Fuck that up real good.
[46:31.420 --> 46:33.580]  Stop giving me these dog shit pieces.
[46:34.060 --> 46:34.620]  Fuck.
[46:35.760 --> 46:38.020]  Oh, I'm such a stupid fool.
[46:39.700 --> 46:41.160]  Got away with it.
[46:43.600 --> 46:44.280]  Never mind.
[46:44.900 --> 46:45.860]  What is happening?
[46:47.240 --> 46:48.640]  Hmm, it's over.
[46:48.960 --> 46:50.100]  Oh, shit!
[46:51.680 --> 46:53.030]  Oh, this is just...
[46:53.580 --> 46:53.960]  Uh-oh!
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.220]  Lost that one!
[46:56.580 --> 46:56.780]  Goodbye.
[47:01.500 --> 47:02.680]  Oh, my God!
[47:02.700 --> 47:03.460]  How did I get that in there?
[47:07.540 --> 47:10.060]  I lose concentration like a
[47:10.060 --> 47:11.180]  cloth-eared fool.
[47:14.420 --> 47:15.660]  Cloth-eared fool?
[47:15.940 --> 47:17.540]  I can't put anything anywhere
[47:17.540 --> 47:18.520]  because they're wonked!
[47:19.640 --> 47:19.840]  Yep.
[47:21.180 --> 47:21.940]  You know what?
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.020]  I can just drop this shit off the side.
[47:27.560 --> 47:28.120]  Okay.
[47:28.400 --> 47:29.220]  Oh, no.
[47:29.920 --> 47:31.300]  Maybe I can use this as a weapon.
[47:32.060 --> 47:32.620]  Shit!
[47:34.600 --> 47:35.560]  We're starting over.
[47:38.180 --> 47:39.920]  Andrew's back to square one.
[47:40.520 --> 47:41.000]  Essentially.
[47:43.140 --> 47:44.140]  What am I doing?
[47:44.260 --> 47:44.820]  Why did I...
[47:45.600 --> 47:46.860]  Stupid dumb idiot.
[47:48.760 --> 47:49.900]  Welcome to the
[47:49.900 --> 47:52.320]  self-deprecating...
[47:52.320 --> 47:54.120]  I lost so much,
[47:54.180 --> 47:55.180]  but maybe that was a good thing.
[47:55.480 --> 47:56.580]  Tugged me the wrong direction.
[47:57.900 --> 47:59.460]  Okay, can I just put this here?
[48:01.280 --> 48:02.240]  Thank goodness.
[48:02.440 --> 48:02.720]  What am I doing?
[48:03.300 --> 48:03.780]  Don't.
[48:05.640 --> 48:05.820]  No!
[48:05.820 --> 48:07.260]  Okay, that actually worked.
[48:09.610 --> 48:10.820]  I've just lost all focus.
[48:11.900 --> 48:12.260]  Okay.
[48:12.940 --> 48:14.340]  That's for you.
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.340]  Big is fine.
[48:19.460 --> 48:20.780]  Alright, okay.
[48:21.620 --> 48:22.600]  That ain't good.
[48:22.700 --> 48:23.800]  Not the balloon!
[48:24.460 --> 48:26.700]  My whole tower just shattered.
[48:26.980 --> 48:27.360]  Stupid.
[48:28.380 --> 48:30.980]  Can I just knock it all over?
[48:33.380 --> 48:34.340]  That piece.
[48:38.880 --> 48:39.800]  Why are you laughing?
[48:40.580 --> 48:41.540]  Ah, shit!
[48:42.540 --> 48:43.020]  Sod!
[48:44.240 --> 48:44.720]  Alright.
[48:45.280 --> 48:46.620]  Time to start anew.
[48:48.320 --> 48:49.860]  Three, two, one.
[48:50.180 --> 48:51.220]  You guys are good, don't worry about it.
[48:51.420 --> 48:53.060]  This is the worst.
[48:53.200 --> 48:55.660]  I'm trying to see where I want to put this.
[48:55.660 --> 48:58.340]  I'm so mad that Eric is the best at this.
[48:58.700 --> 48:59.260]  Look at that.
[48:59.820 --> 49:00.260]  Wow!
[49:01.040 --> 49:03.480]  Before we streamed, he did so much talking
[49:03.480 --> 49:05.200]  about how bad he was going to be at this.
[49:05.400 --> 49:07.400]  Guys, if you're worse
[49:07.400 --> 49:09.080]  than me, that's sad for you.
[49:10.620 --> 49:11.320]  I think you
[49:11.320 --> 49:12.380]  just might be good at this.
[49:12.480 --> 49:13.900]  I don't think so.
[49:14.160 --> 49:16.360]  I think you might just be a real smug bastard.
[49:16.500 --> 49:18.240]  I think that might be true.
[49:18.760 --> 49:19.800]  I mean, you can ask Nick.
[49:20.280 --> 49:20.960]  Oh, I know.
[49:24.480 --> 49:24.920]  Yeah.
[49:30.100 --> 49:31.060]  You fucking
[49:31.060 --> 49:31.720]  dummy.
[49:32.440 --> 49:34.080]  Oh my god.
[49:39.100 --> 49:42.900]  Yeah, sure. Why not?
[49:43.860 --> 49:45.240]  Let's just throw it all away.
[49:45.680 --> 49:47.120]  I mean, there's just nothing good here.
[49:48.940 --> 49:49.360]  And that's gonna
[49:49.360 --> 49:49.980]  fuck me up.
[49:51.020 --> 49:52.080]  Oh, this is gonna be a horrible run.
[49:53.180 --> 49:53.660]  Oh no!
[49:55.380 --> 49:57.260]  I started getting a little too tricky
[49:57.260 --> 49:58.300]  in tricky towers, guys.
[49:58.560 --> 50:00.660]  Well, it is the name of the game. You need to do that.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.160]  You know what?
[50:05.240 --> 50:06.800]  I bet I can make that work.
[50:09.160 --> 50:10.880]  Did I just fix this?
[50:11.460 --> 50:13.260]  Let's see if I can...
[50:14.060 --> 50:14.080]  Yeah.
[50:17.240 --> 50:17.680]  Oops!
[50:19.360 --> 50:20.680]  I mean, this is...
[50:21.400 --> 50:22.800]  Alright, let's see how I did.
[50:25.020 --> 50:25.740]  Alright.
[50:25.980 --> 50:27.040]  Let's see.
[50:29.100 --> 50:30.220]  No! No!
[50:30.440 --> 50:32.700]  No! No! No! No!
[50:32.700 --> 50:33.260]  No! No!
[50:33.740 --> 50:34.840]  Andrew, what happened?
[50:35.320 --> 50:36.400]  All your pieces.
[50:36.900 --> 50:37.940]  All my pieces.
[50:39.480 --> 50:40.600]  Every piece?
[50:41.860 --> 50:43.960]  Wow, Nick has this locked.
[50:44.220 --> 50:45.260]  Look at this.
[50:45.360 --> 50:46.700]  What a run!
[50:47.300 --> 50:49.640]  Run of a lifetime from Nick.
[50:51.100 --> 50:51.620]  Wow!
[50:51.920 --> 50:53.440]  I think you got it, bud.
[50:53.800 --> 50:55.220]  Nick, you did so good!
[50:55.440 --> 50:57.220]  Dude, Nick, that is phenomenal.
[50:57.540 --> 50:59.640]  No wasted space anywhere.
[51:01.140 --> 51:01.760]  I'm jealous.
[51:02.020 --> 51:03.420]  That's great. What a run.
[51:03.620 --> 51:04.520]  Way to go.
[51:05.580 --> 51:06.560]  Four pieces?
[51:07.060 --> 51:09.600]  I mean, those gaps made all the difference.
[51:09.720 --> 51:10.380]  That was incredible.
[51:12.180 --> 51:12.940]  Look at this.
[51:13.020 --> 51:14.960]  You're still in third, but really good stuff.
[51:15.100 --> 51:16.920]  Top gapage efficiency.
[51:17.580 --> 51:18.100]  Gapage?
[51:19.360 --> 51:20.460]  Hey, mind the gap.
[51:21.600 --> 51:22.800]  Mind the gap.
[51:26.020 --> 51:27.740]  How do I want to...
[51:27.740 --> 51:28.200]  Yeah.
[51:28.380 --> 51:30.460]  You know what? It worked out in a rare
[51:31.440 --> 51:32.700]  moment of serendipity.
[51:37.230 --> 51:39.790]  I never trust myself that I'm lined up correctly.
[51:40.610 --> 51:41.490]  It's difficult, isn't it?
[51:43.130 --> 51:44.870]  Because there's all these little half spots.
[51:46.030 --> 51:46.250]  Yeah.
[51:51.440 --> 51:51.960]  Oh!
[51:53.500 --> 51:54.140]  It's fine.
[51:54.200 --> 51:55.520]  It's fine. Don't worry about it.
[51:57.980 --> 51:58.420]  Okay.
[52:07.780 --> 52:10.080]  I just like to throw it on when everybody else has.
[52:10.660 --> 52:11.560]  Well, I deserve that.
[52:11.620 --> 52:12.820]  What is that?
[52:13.140 --> 52:14.480]  People are stealing my shit.
[52:14.860 --> 52:16.780]  Those little rat fucks. What are they doing?
[52:17.460 --> 52:19.340]  They just took a piece and it hurt me?
[52:22.480 --> 52:23.740]  How did it hurt me?
[52:24.400 --> 52:25.720]  I lost... Oh, God.
[52:25.900 --> 52:27.540]  I might be out of this one because of that.
[52:27.920 --> 52:28.920]  That was a great move.
[52:29.460 --> 52:30.220]  Out of the whole thing?
[52:30.780 --> 52:33.000]  Yeah, I'm down to my last heart now.
[52:34.100 --> 52:34.560]  Oh.
[52:35.420 --> 52:35.820]  Yeah.
[52:38.120 --> 52:39.280]  Let's pray for a miracle.
[52:41.060 --> 52:42.660]  All I need is a miracle.
[52:43.280 --> 52:44.400]  All I need.
[52:46.440 --> 52:48.140]  It's not exactly the miracle
[52:48.140 --> 52:49.820]  I was hoping for.
[52:49.820 --> 52:51.140]  Let's pray for that one, if I'm being honest.
[52:55.130 --> 52:55.650]  Huh.
[52:58.370 --> 52:58.890]  Um...
[52:58.890 --> 52:59.110]  Oh.
[53:00.510 --> 53:01.030]  Oh!
[53:06.170 --> 53:06.690]  Must...
[53:06.690 --> 53:08.970]  Oh, no! I blew it!
[53:09.210 --> 53:10.130]  Oh, I blew it.
[53:11.170 --> 53:12.530]  Oh, Daddy blew it.
[53:13.390 --> 53:15.150]  I am... In this game,
[53:15.270 --> 53:17.670]  I have a plan until I get hit in the face.
[53:17.930 --> 53:19.130]  I fuck up once,
[53:19.130 --> 53:21.490]  everything falls apart instantly.
[53:21.770 --> 53:24.170]  Oh, it's getting fast.
[53:24.410 --> 53:26.890]  Oh, it's so fast.
[53:27.590 --> 53:28.390]  Gavin, B.
[53:29.110 --> 53:29.810]  Yeah, there you go.
[53:30.150 --> 53:31.750]  No, those little pricks.
[53:32.750 --> 53:33.950]  Oh, shit.
[53:37.130 --> 53:37.350]  Yes!
[53:37.910 --> 53:40.470]  You were a half second away from winning.
[53:41.010 --> 53:41.270]  Oh!
[53:43.490 --> 53:44.690]  I'm the king of choke.
[53:44.810 --> 53:45.670]  I don't know what to do.
[53:45.670 --> 53:47.690]  I see the light
[53:47.690 --> 53:49.510]  at the end of the tunnel, and I shove a fist
[53:49.510 --> 53:50.270]  down my throat.
[53:54.150 --> 53:54.550]  No!
[54:18.320 --> 54:19.600]  I like when we lock in.
[54:20.200 --> 54:21.000]  Fit, fit, fit.
[54:21.160 --> 54:22.100]  You silly bollocks.
[54:24.700 --> 54:25.500]  Oh, wait.
[54:26.180 --> 54:27.120]  Eh, fuck it, who cares.
[54:29.660 --> 54:31.060]  Get some structural integrity.
[54:31.280 --> 54:34.180]  Oh, that could be...
[54:35.160 --> 54:35.560]  stupid.
[54:35.560 --> 54:36.540]  Why would you do that?
[54:38.880 --> 54:39.840]  Hate myself.
[54:40.400 --> 54:41.680]  Oh, Nick, you've
[54:41.680 --> 54:43.640]  locked into some truly stupid shit here.
[54:43.700 --> 54:43.920]  Okay.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.120]  Uh, oh.
[54:48.440 --> 54:49.260]  Uh, yeah.
[54:51.520 --> 54:51.820]  Well...
[54:53.760 --> 54:55.220]  My good God.
[54:55.780 --> 54:57.140]  Good God and
[54:57.960 --> 54:59.160]  juicy shit.
[54:59.780 --> 55:01.500]  I cannot believe you slotted that thing in.
[55:01.680 --> 55:03.940]  Unbelievable that you just got that.
[55:03.940 --> 55:04.480]  That would have worked.
[55:07.320 --> 55:08.460]  Is it too tall?
[55:09.820 --> 55:10.420]  No, okay.
[55:11.100 --> 55:13.000]  Oh, wow, you got lucky.
[55:13.560 --> 55:14.960]  I can't believe that didn't kick.
[55:23.040 --> 55:23.880]  Oh, Nick.
[55:24.440 --> 55:25.380]  Oh, Nick.
[55:26.040 --> 55:27.260]  Oh, can he get one more piece in?
[55:27.900 --> 55:30.020]  Or will his whole world fall apart?
[55:30.240 --> 55:30.720]  Oh, wow.
[55:31.500 --> 55:32.020]  Wow.
[55:32.600 --> 55:34.060]  What a move!
[55:35.100 --> 55:36.820]  I think you just gotta accept the fate.
[55:36.820 --> 55:37.040]  Yeah.
[55:37.900 --> 55:39.460]  You should be proud of that.
[55:39.720 --> 55:41.300]  Yeah, you should be really happy with that.
[55:42.500 --> 55:44.320]  I keep trying to get ledges going,
[55:44.420 --> 55:46.740]  and then I just make a vertical piece of shit.
[55:47.440 --> 55:50.180]  Oh, no, guys.
[55:50.240 --> 55:50.900]  What happened?
[55:52.500 --> 55:53.380]  Third game.
[55:54.400 --> 55:56.360]  Guys, I'm trying to figure out
[55:56.360 --> 55:58.340]  what happened, and you can't possibly
[55:58.340 --> 55:59.360]  all be this bad.
[55:59.380 --> 56:00.700]  Alright, this one's my game.
[56:00.800 --> 56:01.400]  Alright, here we go.
[56:03.940 --> 56:05.040]  One more or two more?
[56:05.440 --> 56:05.640]  One more.
[56:06.300 --> 56:07.520]  We got time for two.
[56:08.180 --> 56:09.340]  Nick, what do you think? One or two?
[56:10.520 --> 56:11.400]  Sure, why not two?
[56:12.120 --> 56:13.800]  Okay, we got two more.
[56:13.980 --> 56:14.540]  You know what?
[56:14.740 --> 56:18.140]  Unless Gavin wins this first one.
[56:18.160 --> 56:19.940]  If Gavin wins this first one, then we're done.
[56:20.460 --> 56:21.300]  So we got two more.
[56:25.720 --> 56:26.120]  Oh.
[56:27.880 --> 56:28.360]  Pretty rude?
[56:28.360 --> 56:29.460]  Well...
[56:33.720 --> 56:35.420]  Oh, come on.
[56:35.460 --> 56:37.600]  This is the worst possible...
[56:40.820 --> 56:42.220]  It's like the game knew
[56:42.220 --> 56:44.540]  and decided to...
[56:45.320 --> 56:46.560]  Don't do that.
[56:48.280 --> 56:49.240]  Oh, hello.
[56:49.560 --> 56:50.000]  Hello.
[56:52.300 --> 56:53.840]  Why did that even happen?
[56:55.080 --> 56:55.860]  Well, that's not good.
[57:01.210 --> 57:03.970]  Well, that's less than ideal,
[57:03.970 --> 57:05.450]  if I'm being completely honest.
[57:06.570 --> 57:07.490]  Oh my god.
[57:07.790 --> 57:08.790]  Oh, Jesus!
[57:11.730 --> 57:13.270]  How long does this go on?
[57:13.370 --> 57:13.690]  Bad, bad, bad!
[57:15.810 --> 57:16.370]  Bad!
[57:19.290 --> 57:22.090]  What a fat turd sack of shit.
[57:23.310 --> 57:25.710]  No! I deserve that.
[57:27.810 --> 57:29.190]  Oh, that was a little off.
[57:29.650 --> 57:30.310]  Oh, shit.
[57:34.130 --> 57:34.930]  Oh, shit.
[57:35.650 --> 57:36.970]  Don't worry, I got my vines, fellas.
[57:39.010 --> 57:39.390]  Shit!
[57:40.330 --> 57:40.950]  Oh, no.
[57:41.190 --> 57:41.370]  Shit!
[57:43.610 --> 57:45.530]  Go back to three. Nick, you have to pick it up.
[57:45.730 --> 57:46.910]  Oh, shit. You got it!
[57:47.110 --> 57:48.190]  At what cost, though, Eric?
[57:49.290 --> 57:52.150]  At the cost of two fucking hearts!
[57:52.170 --> 57:53.270]  Andrew has all of his powers,
[57:53.390 --> 57:55.250]  but he's gonna die right here. Andrew's out!
[57:55.630 --> 57:57.090]  No! Two!
[57:57.810 --> 57:58.050]  Nick!
[57:58.370 --> 58:01.590]  I cannot believe this shit.
[58:02.350 --> 58:03.790]  Oh, look at that block!
[58:03.850 --> 58:04.830]  It was that way down.
[58:05.070 --> 58:06.110]  My last life.
[58:07.150 --> 58:09.150]  Thanks, Michelson, for the prime sub.
[58:09.510 --> 58:11.690]  Oh, thank you so much!
[58:12.910 --> 58:13.550]  Thanks, everyone
[58:13.550 --> 58:14.550]  watching live on Twitch.
[58:15.430 --> 58:17.530]  If you're watching the VOD and you have something
[58:17.530 --> 58:18.770]  to say, keep it to your fucking self.
[58:22.010 --> 58:22.850]  Oh, interesting.
[58:24.930 --> 58:25.350]  Interesting.
[58:25.350 --> 58:25.790]  Interesting.
[58:27.830 --> 58:28.810]  Very well.
[58:30.270 --> 58:30.910]  It's fine.
[58:31.250 --> 58:33.610]  How do I want to play
[58:33.610 --> 58:34.690]  this?
[58:35.430 --> 58:37.450]  I regret how I played
[58:37.450 --> 58:38.510]  this already.
[58:40.310 --> 58:41.670]  Already regret.
[58:41.850 --> 58:42.650]  Don't like this.
[58:42.770 --> 58:43.950]  I think I blew this early.
[58:44.350 --> 58:46.650]  Oh, boys.
[58:48.330 --> 58:49.690]  I can do...
[58:49.690 --> 58:51.110]  I just refused to...
[58:51.110 --> 58:52.550]  I refused to learn.
[58:52.550 --> 58:53.590]  Look at that. That worked.
[58:54.770 --> 58:56.410]  Nick, I can't believe that worked.
[58:56.850 --> 58:57.830]  I can't either.
[58:59.710 --> 59:00.790]  Andrew tried for the same move.
[59:00.910 --> 59:01.750]  Did not work out for Andrew.
[59:01.870 --> 59:03.830]  Do you think this will hold?
[59:06.270 --> 59:07.930]  I didn't say anything.
[59:08.150 --> 59:09.430]  I had no idea if it was going to hold or not.
[59:09.430 --> 59:11.030]  I didn't either. That's why I asked you.
[59:12.010 --> 59:13.250]  Wow, look at that.
[59:14.870 --> 59:16.070]  The chat's going nuts.
[59:16.170 --> 59:17.670]  They can't believe what you just laid down.
[59:17.750 --> 59:18.270]  Accept your fate.
[59:18.270 --> 59:19.610]  Yeah, I agree.
[59:20.470 --> 59:21.670]  You won already.
[59:21.870 --> 59:23.530]  I think that's a win for you.
[59:23.610 --> 59:24.290]  Oh man.
[59:26.270 --> 59:27.310]  Gavin and I were
[59:28.310 --> 59:28.830]  idiots.
[59:31.050 --> 59:32.310]  Back in the pack.
[59:36.210 --> 59:38.610]  Wow, Nick is running away with it.
[59:38.750 --> 59:38.830]  What?
[59:39.330 --> 59:42.150]  He's got one more medal tonight. Let's calm down.
[59:42.170 --> 59:42.610]  Let's not.
[59:44.090 --> 59:47.030]  Let's calm down with running away with it.
[59:47.030 --> 59:49.310]  Don't put Andrew in nuts mode.
[59:50.810 --> 59:51.770]  Nuts mode?
[59:52.030 --> 59:54.130]  Yeah, you go nuts and win the game.
[59:55.670 --> 59:55.810]  Okay.
[59:56.730 --> 59:57.150]  Yeah.
[59:58.430 --> 59:59.270]  Nuts mode.
[01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.350]  Andrew, are you in nuts mode right now?
[01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:06.110]  I'm in peanut mode.
[01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:06.950]  You have no idea.
[01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:16.580]  Nope, that was a mistake.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.180]  You know what?
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.480]  Well...
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.940]  No.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:26.980]  What happened?
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.060]  Oh no.
[01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:31.300]  That's bad.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:32.840]  That's bad.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.200]  That could have been worse.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.780]  Same one. Stop giving me the same piece.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.240]  You fucking dick wagons.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.940]  Dick wagons?
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.840]  That's a new one.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.140]  Oh...
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.940]  I've messed it up.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.100]  Bollocks.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.620]  The whole thing again.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.940]  This is how he's going to talk to Meg about it later.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.300]  Just too much of an idiot.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.120]  Oops, clumsy sod.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.100]  Oh shit.
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.840]  What have you done with me there?
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.940]  That bubble has...
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.180]  What the fuck was that?
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.760]  What happened?
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.140]  I'm dead!
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.140]  Oh, the double bubble really fucked me.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.420]  Double mint gum.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.740]  Dude, how come I cannot fucking lay a piece down to save my life?
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.180]  Top heavy.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.780]  I don't wanna...
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:37.980]  I don't wanna be on this planet anymore.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.640]  I need to build up to the thing that I already did earlier.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.460]  Here we go.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.580]  Is it stuck?
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.320]  Sideways!
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:49.960]  Whoops.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.300]  What am I doing?
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:57.880]  Whoops!
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:58.720]  No!
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.680]  No! Oh, actually...
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.820]  That fucked me so bad!
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.240]  Well, that's okay.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.600]  That fucked me so...
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.360]  You have no idea what you've done.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.120]  You bastard. You bastard man.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:11.800]  I'll kill you.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:15.180]  No! My whole tower!
[01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:17.920]  It's gone.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.220]  The whole thing is gone.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.440]  No, please, no!
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.500]  My hard work!
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.440]  My home!
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:26.860]  No!
[01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.460]  What's the fucking point of...
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.120]  Just end it!
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.540]  I was so close!
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.620]  Gavin did it!
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.020]  The whole thing was on a crooked block.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.240]  I don't know how I did it.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.840]  I was doing so well.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.720]  The tower just came off under me.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.540]  That was terrible.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.060]  You might want to tell Jordan,
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.640]  never mind the time.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:55.620]  I'm looking at it now and I'm like,
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.080]  well...
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.920]  I told you.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.500]  What did you tell me?
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.560]  I tried to get everyone to move the time.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.560]  I tried to make it all work.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.120]  Okay.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.400]  I knew exactly what we were getting into.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.060]  Okay.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.440]  What am I doing?
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.560]  No!
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.360]  Okay.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.680]  I have to accept my fate.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.420]  Video games are stupid.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.700]  I fucking hate video games.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:46.300]  Andrew, what happened?
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:47.880]  Everything!
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.580]  Guys, daddy wins again.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.260]  I'm still not out of this.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:02.460]  Gavin!
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.640]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.480]  Gavin, you have to win this thing.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:06.820]  Gavin!
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.260]  Fulfilling an obligation to stream at 4pm
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:11.680]  on a Friday.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.020]  Is that the way you view it?
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.300]  I view it like hanging out with my buddies.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.580]  Oh god, that was
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:21.940]  fucking funny.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.340]  Andrew's saying video games
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.220]  are stupid.
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.060]  It's so funny.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.980]  Did you hear that?
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.360]  He clipped out.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.140]  He clipped out so bad.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.980]  I don't even know what to do about this.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.680]  That was so funny.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.460]  What has someone done?
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.620]  What is...
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.020]  Fuck it.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.020]  What has someone done?
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.340]  Oh, interesting.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.480]  Didn't solve a single one of my problems.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.580]  But did it make one of them worse?
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.360]  I don't know how to feel yet.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:15.740]  Oh shit.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.800]  Shit sauce soup sauce.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.200]  Oh, soup's on.
[01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:24.330]  Oh.
[01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:25.490]  That's the worst possible piece
[01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:26.290]  it could be. Oh!
[01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:31.570]  I...
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.580]  It's like...
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.700]  I mean...
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.560]  That fell apart in such
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.520]  an incredible way.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.920]  I went all the way back there for the studs.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.640]  How did that happen?
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.040]  No!
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.500]  No!
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.360]  Oops!
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.740]  I'm getting too cutesy now.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.660]  What's it doing?
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.660]  No, it was perfect!
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.620]  No, no, no, no, no!
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.460]  No, you little twat!
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.400]  What happened?
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.700]  I had it locked and I was winning!
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.560]  Oh shit!
[01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:24.290]  Here we go, boys!
[01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:25.610]  Oh no.
[01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:28.150]  Guys, looking at the time,
[01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.670]  unfortunately, I think this might have to be our last one.
[01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:32.230]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me!
[01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:33.090]  Okay.
[01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.090]  Beaker, is that you?
[01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:40.590]  Oh dear, this is...
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.260]  I instantly regret this decision.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.600]  Instantly!
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.080]  Well...
[01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.960]  Boys, boys, boys.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.000]  Not good.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.700]  Yeah, just...
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.620]  bunged it there.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:02.820]  I got one.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.960]  I got one piece.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.040]  I got one piece.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.720]  Oh my god.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.640]  I got one.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.640]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.680]  Here comes the win from Andrew.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.580]  You couldn't...
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.080]  Video games are stupid.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.660]  Are stupid.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.520]  Remain to be stupid.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.000]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.800]  With the time that we're at, we're running short on time.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.660]  It's up to Nick if we're going to do
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.640]  one last game or not.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.080]  Let me check traffic.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.800]  Let me check.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.060]  Let me check.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.020]  It's rush hour.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:49.880]  Yeah.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:51.920]  We'll be late.
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:53.340]  Hey!
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.000]  Nick said one more.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.720]  This is it.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.060]  Here we go.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.540]  Another puzzle.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.560]  Guys, thank you so much
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.180]  for watching. We really appreciate you.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.340]  Thank you for everyone who shows up here on Fridays
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.080]  for us. This has been a lot of fun.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.340]  I'm a little mad at myself right now.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.620]  If I'm being completely honest.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.240]  A little mad at myself.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.380]  There's no way this sucks me.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.560]  Oh, I don't know if I can do this.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.540]  I don't know if that'll work. I'm not going to do it.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.400]  I blew it!
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.980]  I had it and I blew it.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.880]  That's not going to work.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.360]  Nope. Nope. Oh dear.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.300]  Could I
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.200]  attempt
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.240]  a sod?
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.600]  Sod and bollocks!
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:49.880]  I cannot believe.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.160]  Nick, I think that was your game
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.800]  winner there, bud. I think you did it.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.860]  If you don't blow it here, then I think you got it.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.080]  Yeah, I'm just going to take it. I don't care.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.060]  I wonder how many bits have been lost to betting on
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:03.840]  me in the chat.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.800]  We tied
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.720]  for last, Gavin.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.160]  That sucks.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.760]  Points, I guess.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.920]  Yeah, but it's better than
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.740]  being last last.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:17.660]  Yeah, true.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:18.600]  That's true.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.600]  Let's see what we got here.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.980]  Oh, the worst possible
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.400]  starting piece. The flat.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.520]  Here...
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.440]  Here...
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.160]  That's fine with it.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.700]  Oh, I'm such a stupid
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.640]  boar on it. It's painful.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:02.840]  Cool.
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.060]  Cool!
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.900]  I hate
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.900]  those little sons of bitches.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:10.680]  Can I...
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.220]  I hate them. I hate them.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.440]  I want the worst in them for life
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:16.940]  for them.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.580]  And
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.420]  no one else?
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.620]  Oh, this is bad.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.260]  I don't know. I've got the skittiest
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.220]  turd of a tower.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.440]  No!
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.960]  Oh, God!
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.300]  Oh, this
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.540]  is only, truly
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.560]  the end times.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.560]  That actually helped. That flip.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.280]  Nope, nope, nope. Sure didn't.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.560]  Oh, no.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.460]  Oh, no.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.480]  Uh-oh.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.400]  Eric, stay strong.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:55.440]  Oh, Eric.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.260]  Get the heart, Eric. Oh, no!
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.960]  What is happening?
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.360]  I just went
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.300]  straight line up.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.520]  MKNudstrup, thank you for the prime subs.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.300]  Oh, my God, thank you for all
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.260]  the subs. Falling apart. Gavin, you're
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.400]  in... what are you doing? That's incredible.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.100]  Gavin.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.260]  Gavin's gone non-verbal.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.080]  Alright, this
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.560]  is it. Okay.
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.240]  That's what I like to hear, bud. You a race guy?
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.140]  Oh, love me a race.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.080]  Here we go!
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:32.260]  Oh.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:33.840]  Uh-oh.
[01:11:39.130 --> 01:11:39.810]  Freaking hell.
[01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.310]  Oh, that actually... you know what? Yeah, it's fine.
[01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:49.630]  Oh, this is peaceful music.
[01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:51.150]  That's so nice.
[01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:53.370]  Why did I do that?
[01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:57.950]  Oh, shit.
[01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:00.190]  What?
[01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:01.330]  What is happening?
[01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:03.250]  You must be punished.
[01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:06.210]  Oh, that got me.
[01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:07.750]  Good.
[01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:08.470]  What the fuck?
[01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:11.950]  What happened? Oh, my God.
[01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:14.130]  What?
[01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:17.970]  This piece will not stop!
[01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.470]  No!
[01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.730]  Like, really wanted me to place that piece.
[01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:27.750]  Do I want that like that? I don't really know.
[01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.030]  I don't think so.
[01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:31.570]  But, whatever. Oops!
[01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:35.530]  Oh, I don't want it like that.
[01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:37.530]  Yeah, that was good, baby!
[01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:39.850]  No, I don't want it like that.
[01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:41.810]  Stop doing it!
[01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.910]  Stop doing it!
[01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:45.450]  Let me die in peace!
[01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:51.450]  Oh, this infernal balloon!
[01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:53.010]  Oops!
[01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:55.350]  No!
[01:12:58.570 --> 01:12:59.690]  No!
[01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:01.630]  Tits!
[01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:03.270]  Shit!
[01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:05.370]  No.
[01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.550]  Dammit, dammit, dammit.
[01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.230]  Bollocks, fuckwit.
[01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:13.890]  Stop!
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.380]  Who cares?
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.420]  That's not gonna work.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.340]  Doesn't matter.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:24.720]  Wait!
[01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.030]  Come on.
[01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.450]  Come on, Nick. This is it. Your chance to shine.
[01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.810]  Shit, you fucked it instantly.
[01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:37.450]  Nope.
[01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:39.190]  Goodbye.
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:40.730]  Here we go.
[01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.730]  No, my whole tower!
[01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.410]  No!
[01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:48.950]  Maybe if I can just hang these pieces.
[01:13:49.230 --> 01:13:50.250]  There goes some more tower.
[01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.570]  No!
[01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:55.410]  It's fine.
[01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:56.070]  Doesn't matter.
[01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:57.570]  Sneak in!
[01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:01.010]  No!
[01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:02.470]  Kill Andrew!
[01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:04.870]  The pier!
[01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:06.190]  Come on!
[01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:11.810]  The climb!
[01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.130]  Oh my god!
[01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.370]  Jack piece of shit!
[01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.470]  Fucking bushy shite!
[01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:25.390]  Alright Gavin, you're last with me.
[01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:28.230]  I might win this game!
[01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:29.150]  Now we have to.
[01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:29.470]  No!
[01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.750]  No!
[01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:35.890]  Oh, interesting.
[01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:40.610]  Yeah, tell him.
[01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.270]  Oh, you got me.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.160]  Don't fall.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:07.940]  That's not good.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.780]  I don't think I like that move.
[01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:20.010]  Oh dear.
[01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:24.730]  I think my fate is worse than death.
[01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:25.670]  Oh, I could have put it there.
[01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:28.810]  Oh, I see the spot right at the end where I could have gotten one more.
[01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:30.150]  I guess I'm looking at everyone else's.
[01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:30.910]  It probably doesn't matter.
[01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.730]  It doesn't.
[01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:34.690]  Andrew might have it. Andrew might win.
[01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:37.010]  I mean, if Andrew gets second, I think he wins, right?
[01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:39.170]  Andrew, don't try it. Just accept your fate.
[01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:41.510]  There you go.
[01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.030]  Alright, Gavin, you got this.
[01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:47.530]  There you go. Good work, Gavin.
[01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:49.470]  There you go.
[01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:51.490]  You got it.
[01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:52.330]  You got it.
[01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:54.450]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.290]  Oh, there you go.
[01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:57.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.050]  That might be good.
[01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:01.250]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:03.870]  Oh, I wouldn't get...
[01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:04.170]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:08.330]  That's all you can do.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.220]  Here it comes.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.260]  Yeah!
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:17.480]  Shit.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.780]  Andrew wins the whole thing, guys.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.000]  Oh no, he's going to be shot.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:21.480]  No!
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.300]  No!
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.060]  Okay, I just need to not come in last.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.560]  You just need to choke it up, son.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.020]  Just not last.
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.480]  I can't believe I'm going to lose
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.160]  to Andrew and then have to
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.760]  all balls out of here.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.260]  Yes, you are.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.200]  Yes, you are.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.100]  Why are you laughing?
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.100]  I told you.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.780]  I knew exactly what was going to happen today.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.600]  I knew it.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.340]  Guys, this is not a good run
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.620]  for Daddy. This is bad.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.300]  I don't like that you're starting
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.180]  to call yourself Dad. I don't like it either. I'm an actual
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.300]  Dad. What the fuck?
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.640]  It's offensive to Nick's people.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.120]  How do you keep making this bigger?
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.620]  Oh my God! I'm dead.
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.520]  That gave me an achievement for that.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.520]  Oh, me too.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.620]  I would tell you, but I
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:33.800]  turned off notifications for streams.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:39.460]  Oh, no!
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.420]  I'm going to come in last.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:43.440]  I won!
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.040]  I won! I really appreciate you guys so much.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.320]  Oh, come on.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.140]  I'm sending it into the abyss.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.260]  I don't even need it.
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:53.700]  Dickhead shit!
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.660]  Gavin, beautiful.
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.000]  Just lay it down, buddy.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:00.960]  What a win.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.620]  Gavin wins the round, I win the game!
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.940]  Good job, Andrew!
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:13.880]  Thanks, Nick!
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:14.980]  And we all won!
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.780]  Looks like the VOD got corrupted.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:18.120]  Oh!
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.960]  Hang it when that happens!
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.560]  Son of a bitch!
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600]  Guys, thank you so...
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.200]  We better back out of this so it doesn't start another one.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:31.700]  Guys, thank you so much for
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.120]  watching today. That was a lot of fun.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.120]  That was a great game.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.660]  Tricky Towers. Watch this on
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.800]  Tuesday. If you're already watching the VOD, then come by
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.780]  on Friday. That's when we do live streams.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.800]  We really do appreciate it
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.680]  when you guys stop by. All the Prime subs, all the...
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:47.640]  All the chat, all the bets,
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.920]  everything was going really well.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:50.980]  Miss Rat is strong.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.620]  Thank you guys so much for being here.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.720]  RegulateTreon.com
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.240]  is the website you can go to.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.620]  We'll have some really cool
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.160]  stuff coming out this weekend, but guys,
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.700]  that'll do it for us. Any final thoughts for all
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.760]  the people at home, guys? I'm a winner!
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.460]  I won!
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.700]  The next time we play this, I'm gonna
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.960]  win every single round.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.960]  Yeah, man, if you say so.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.320]  Absolutely. I believe in you.
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.120]  Okay. Alright guys, we'll see you later. Bye!
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:18.740]  Alright, bye!
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.520]  I'm gonna cool Ray.
