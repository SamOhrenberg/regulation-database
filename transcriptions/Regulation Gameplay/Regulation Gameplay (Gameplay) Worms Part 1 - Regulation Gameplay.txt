[00:00.000 --> 00:08.540]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay. Today, we're going to be playing Worms WMD.
[00:10.540 --> 00:14.760]  And it's Gavin-less. We had to get the worst player out.
[00:15.500 --> 00:17.940]  Oh my god. Yeah. He got relegated.
[00:18.220 --> 00:23.900]  Yeah, so he got relegated. He's down. He's gonna have to work his way back up.
[00:24.080 --> 00:29.480]  I know the next Worms game is him and Wrexham, and then one of those two will get promoted, so we'll see what happens.
[00:29.480 --> 00:35.380]  I think what he's hoping for is that he rubs elbows with Rob and...
[00:35.380 --> 00:37.100]  Oh, yeah. You know he's up.
[00:37.120 --> 00:41.520]  Maybe they do like a spin-off series, like, oh, we can help this other group of losers out, too.
[00:41.860 --> 00:46.440]  You know that he... Gavin's such a mint mobile guy. You know he's trying to...
[00:46.440 --> 00:47.680]  Oh, a big mint mobile guy.
[00:47.960 --> 00:53.060]  Geoff, can I still anticipate Spike Face? We still getting Spike Face?
[00:55.080 --> 00:56.980]  Cause I'm a Wayne. I'm real excited.
[00:57.160 --> 00:57.980]  Shit, that's funny.
[00:58.480 --> 01:01.860]  Hey, I just had an idea of making fun of Gavin and talking about relegation.
[01:02.240 --> 01:10.000]  We should do a series where the loser gets booted and they get relegated down and a new person has to come in.
[01:10.400 --> 01:15.720]  I love the idea of relegation in a game like Worms or something that doesn't matter.
[01:15.960 --> 01:17.640]  Because there's one too many of us.
[01:21.280 --> 01:22.360]  I think that's great.
[01:22.540 --> 01:25.940]  Yeah, we need to Lord of the Flies this production a little bit.
[01:25.940 --> 01:26.800]  I agree.
[01:26.920 --> 01:27.720]  Take that, piggy.
[01:30.100 --> 01:34.580]  It's Worms time, fellas. I forgot how to play this game. I'm excited to see it.
[01:34.740 --> 01:35.000]  I've never played it.
[01:35.660 --> 01:37.140]  You've never played this, Nick?
[01:37.380 --> 01:38.640]  I've never played Worms.
[01:38.660 --> 01:39.160]  In your life?
[01:39.860 --> 01:40.960]  Never. Not once.
[01:41.080 --> 01:42.540]  Oh, Nick. You're set.
[01:43.880 --> 01:47.500]  It's thinking about it. It's thinking about it.
[01:47.500 --> 01:48.260]  Here we go.
[01:48.560 --> 01:51.120]  We're getting the buttons over and over and over again.
[01:51.900 --> 01:53.640]  No matter how many times you play it.
[01:55.940 --> 01:56.960]  What the hell?
[01:57.380 --> 02:00.880]  Well, Gavin isn't here, so I wanted to honor him.
[02:01.100 --> 02:02.960]  My team is Gavin's favorite.
[02:08.640 --> 02:09.600]  I guess.
[02:10.120 --> 02:12.000]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[02:12.120 --> 02:12.660]  You got it, bud.
[02:12.920 --> 02:14.160]  Come on, you got it.
[02:14.780 --> 02:18.060]  You got it.
[02:18.600 --> 02:19.840]  You live there now.
[02:20.220 --> 02:21.460]  No, no, no. You got it, man.
[02:22.620 --> 02:24.980]  You're fine. You got it.
[02:24.980 --> 02:25.600]  Oh, no.
[02:27.040 --> 02:29.560]  Right. Okay. And then go ahead right there and then backflip.
[02:29.660 --> 02:31.280]  Okay, here we go. And backflip.
[02:32.200 --> 02:32.600]  And...
[02:32.600 --> 02:33.500]  Gotta channel my right of doing.
[02:33.600 --> 02:33.940]  Yeah!
[02:35.240 --> 02:35.480]  Okay.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.040]  What do I want to do?
[02:38.240 --> 02:38.980]  That's a great question.
[02:39.400 --> 02:42.580]  What the fuck are these names? What is going on?
[02:43.160 --> 02:43.760]  What are you talking about?
[02:43.960 --> 02:44.200]  Tony?
[02:45.200 --> 02:45.640]  Yeah, Tony.
[02:45.720 --> 02:47.820]  Do you think Tony is the one that I'm talking about?
[02:48.100 --> 02:49.060]  Oh, Batgirl?
[02:49.200 --> 02:49.640]  I had a feeling.
[02:49.800 --> 02:50.060]  No.
[02:51.100 --> 02:51.480]  Gassy Hands?
[02:51.480 --> 02:52.100]  Gassy Hands?
[02:52.660 --> 02:53.580]  I don't have that.
[02:53.580 --> 02:55.160]  I don't have that.
[02:55.940 --> 03:01.420]  Do you not see RW0000000003?
[03:02.160 --> 03:06.900]  Oh, you mean Regulation Worm 000000003?
[03:07.460 --> 03:09.180]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[03:09.420 --> 03:15.040]  Regulation Worm and you didn't... That's so... That's stupid.
[03:15.560 --> 03:15.760]  That's so stupid.
[03:15.760 --> 03:19.360]  Alright, Regulation Worm 000000001.
[03:19.680 --> 03:20.360]  Alright.
[03:20.980 --> 03:22.060]  Enter the flame.
[03:22.060 --> 03:22.560]  Oh, no.
[03:22.560 --> 03:28.220]  What is the... What's the worm that's right behind that Regulation Worm?
[03:28.320 --> 03:29.620]  How do I leave the flame?
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.480]  It's censored, unfortunately. It was Butt Tongue.
[03:32.740 --> 03:32.880]  Oh.
[03:34.340 --> 03:36.200]  You think it was the butt or the tongue that got it?
[03:36.260 --> 03:36.440]  Yeah.
[03:37.220 --> 03:39.040]  How does I... Okay, here we go.
[03:40.680 --> 03:41.480]  Man, it's been a while.
[03:41.520 --> 03:43.200]  How does I is exactly how worms go.
[03:44.060 --> 03:44.760]  Oh, damn.
[03:45.600 --> 03:46.920]  Oh, that sucked.
[03:47.100 --> 03:47.840]  Yeah, that really sucked.
[03:47.840 --> 03:48.600]  Oh, shit.
[03:49.040 --> 03:49.920]  You better get out of there, bud.
[03:51.040 --> 03:51.840]  You better...
[03:51.840 --> 03:52.040]  Uh-oh.
[03:52.280 --> 03:53.360]  Uh-oh.
[03:53.640 --> 03:56.560]  Well, you have to lick these flames off my butt.
[03:59.780 --> 04:00.340]  Alright.
[04:00.700 --> 04:01.980]  Alright, Nick. All you...
[04:01.980 --> 04:02.260]  Timmy.
[04:02.560 --> 04:03.660]  You're Timmy.
[04:04.900 --> 04:06.280]  Did you name your characters?
[04:07.120 --> 04:08.960]  Are you Timmy or are you Timmy?
[04:09.920 --> 04:10.480]  Timmy.
[04:11.020 --> 04:11.660]  In this instance.
[04:12.000 --> 04:12.160]  Gotcha.
[04:12.320 --> 04:13.300]  Let's see here.
[04:14.800 --> 04:18.400]  Not Regulation Worm 000000004.
[04:18.580 --> 04:18.920]  Oh, no.
[04:18.920 --> 04:20.400]  Oh, my God.
[04:20.580 --> 04:22.300]  Oh, no way.
[04:22.420 --> 04:22.800]  No.
[04:23.240 --> 04:23.720]  No.
[04:24.180 --> 04:24.660]  No.
[04:25.520 --> 04:26.480]  Oh, no.
[04:26.740 --> 04:27.600]  Oh, thank God.
[04:27.860 --> 04:28.200]  Uh-oh.
[04:28.620 --> 04:30.040]  Dude, how did that not go off?
[04:30.600 --> 04:31.680]  I thought it was gonna explode.
[04:32.060 --> 04:32.960]  It's either a dud or I.
[04:32.960 --> 04:34.000]  I can see it's below it.
[04:34.920 --> 04:35.060]  Oh.
[04:35.960 --> 04:36.440]  Okay.
[04:36.780 --> 04:37.640]  Let's see.
[04:40.740 --> 04:42.160]  Okay, I'm gonna...
[04:42.160 --> 04:43.040]  I'm a little disappointed.
[04:43.280 --> 04:44.220]  I'm Batgirl.
[04:46.020 --> 04:49.020]  I made two worms teams for this.
[04:49.180 --> 04:51.360]  My other team has a character named Batgirl.
[04:51.600 --> 04:51.820]  Really?
[04:51.860 --> 04:52.920]  I'm glad I went with the one I did.
[04:53.140 --> 04:53.280]  Yeah.
[04:54.140 --> 04:55.200]  That's pretty cool.
[04:56.540 --> 04:57.080]  Okay, go.
[04:57.360 --> 04:57.620]  Go.
[04:58.100 --> 04:58.400]  Go.
[04:58.600 --> 04:58.960]  Fire.
[05:02.860 --> 05:03.900]  Get out.
[05:04.500 --> 05:04.740]  Go.
[05:05.020 --> 05:05.280]  Okay.
[05:06.500 --> 05:07.020]  Great.
[05:07.420 --> 05:07.740]  Alright.
[05:07.960 --> 05:09.240]  Well, everything's working out.
[05:09.460 --> 05:10.060]  This is good.
[05:11.500 --> 05:14.240]  Dude, you could fuck up a Tommy and Tiny right there.
[05:14.240 --> 05:14.380]  Oh, yeah.
[05:14.540 --> 05:15.600]  Timmy and Tommy.
[05:16.240 --> 05:16.440]  Tiny.
[05:16.900 --> 05:17.380]  You could.
[05:17.780 --> 05:18.080]  Oh, wow.
[05:18.140 --> 05:19.380]  You're not even going for Regulation Worm.
[05:19.440 --> 05:20.240]  You're not even getting revenge.
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.020]  No, I don't need it.
[05:22.040 --> 05:23.260]  My team is called the T-Sters.
[05:23.620 --> 05:24.400]  And they're just people with the same name.
[05:24.480 --> 05:25.520]  That's what you were doing.
[05:25.580 --> 05:26.300]  The T-Sters.
[05:26.420 --> 05:27.080]  That's fun.
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.560]  We got a blood tube because Eric and I definitely didn't do the exact same bit.
[05:34.340 --> 05:35.640]  We need to back my teams.
[05:38.380 --> 05:39.440]  How do I...
[05:40.060 --> 05:41.220]  How do I scale this?
[05:41.380 --> 05:42.400]  Oh, shit.
[05:42.740 --> 05:43.600]  What a move.
[05:44.860 --> 05:46.340]  Okay, now what's the plan here?
[05:49.080 --> 05:53.500]  I'm going to do what Shohei Otani wanted to do to his translator.
[05:53.600 --> 05:54.020]  Cheat?
[05:54.160 --> 05:55.000]  What I'm going to do.
[05:55.860 --> 05:56.260]  Bam!
[05:56.720 --> 05:57.220]  Oh, wow.
[05:57.700 --> 05:59.620]  That didn't quite work the way I thought.
[05:59.620 --> 06:00.920]  I thought you were going to fly off.
[06:01.520 --> 06:02.220]  That was disappointing.
[06:02.800 --> 06:04.660]  You'd think Shohei would have been angrier than that.
[06:04.760 --> 06:08.260]  Yeah, you would think, but apparently he wasn't.
[06:08.520 --> 06:09.360]  This is nice, I guess.
[06:10.060 --> 06:12.120]  I love that he had a $10 bet.
[06:12.420 --> 06:14.200]  I'm so curious what that was.
[06:14.500 --> 06:16.020]  What was the $10 bet?
[06:16.040 --> 06:16.580]  I know, I know.
[06:17.600 --> 06:20.180]  The dude clearly had serious problems.
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.360]  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and...
[06:21.360 --> 06:21.700]  Okay.
[06:22.840 --> 06:24.000]  See what's up with this.
[06:25.340 --> 06:27.220]  Tony right there, locked in.
[06:27.460 --> 06:27.860]  Oh!
[06:27.940 --> 06:29.520]  Uh-oh.
[06:30.900 --> 06:31.920]  Oh, my God.
[06:32.760 --> 06:33.800]  That's so much death.
[06:33.860 --> 06:35.260]  Yeah, Tony, I think you're toast.
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.040]  Nope, he's fine.
[06:40.140 --> 06:40.980]  Wow, 63.
[06:41.020 --> 06:41.220]  Oh, wow.
[06:42.120 --> 06:43.100]  Still in it.
[06:43.980 --> 06:44.540]  Alright, Nick.
[06:47.460 --> 06:48.860]  Oh, it's going for Nick in the hole.
[06:49.160 --> 06:49.300]  Yeah.
[06:49.740 --> 06:50.240]  No, never mind.
[06:50.560 --> 06:50.840]  Nope.
[06:51.220 --> 06:51.880]  Alright, Nick.
[06:52.040 --> 06:53.520]  Oh, look at that right there.
[06:53.820 --> 06:54.220]  Oh, no.
[06:54.220 --> 06:55.120]  Could be revenge time.
[06:58.080 --> 07:00.420]  Could show him a thing or two about a thing or two, you know what I mean?
[07:00.640 --> 07:01.040]  Oh, no.
[07:01.540 --> 07:04.160]  Anyway, how do I go through my listing of things here?
[07:04.340 --> 07:05.240]  What was this worm?
[07:05.240 --> 07:05.900]  What was this game again?
[07:06.060 --> 07:07.300]  This was Handjobs for Strangers.
[07:08.000 --> 07:08.080]  Oh, Butt Tongue.
[07:08.080 --> 07:08.540]  Oh, Butt Tongue.
[07:09.440 --> 07:09.740]  Got you.
[07:09.980 --> 07:13.260]  They let gassy handies in, but they didn't let Butt Tongue in.
[07:13.880 --> 07:14.200]  Crazy.
[07:14.600 --> 07:15.280]  Crazy, honestly.
[07:15.340 --> 07:17.080]  What do I push to go through stuff?
[07:17.260 --> 07:17.740]  Oh, there it is.
[07:17.820 --> 07:17.920]  Okay.
[07:18.980 --> 07:19.480]  Oh, no.
[07:19.780 --> 07:20.600]  Oh, no!
[07:20.780 --> 07:21.200]  Hell, yeah.
[07:21.560 --> 07:22.640]  Well, hell, yeah.
[07:23.280 --> 07:24.260]  Well, if I'm being honest...
[07:24.260 --> 07:25.360]  How did you not take damage?
[07:25.760 --> 07:26.480]  Yeah, what happened?
[07:26.620 --> 07:27.060]  I don't know.
[07:27.420 --> 07:28.080]  Dang, dude.
[07:28.120 --> 07:28.820]  You lucked out.
[07:29.960 --> 07:31.020]  Slow-mo's right there.
[07:31.140 --> 07:31.900]  Oh, man.
[07:32.560 --> 07:33.280]  Oh, man.
[07:35.420 --> 07:36.680]  Slap him down.
[07:37.020 --> 07:37.720]  Home run!
[07:38.280 --> 07:39.780]  I hope it's never coming down.
[07:39.780 --> 07:40.540]  It's never slow-mo!
[07:40.760 --> 07:41.260]  Wow.
[07:43.360 --> 07:44.000]  Wow.
[07:44.660 --> 07:45.500]  Shot at 60 frames, too.
[07:45.900 --> 07:46.180]  Yeah.
[07:46.500 --> 07:47.180]  That was beautiful.
[07:48.100 --> 07:48.740]  Wow.
[07:49.500 --> 07:50.240]  Uh-oh.
[07:57.020 --> 07:58.000]  Don't do it!
[07:59.260 --> 08:00.740]  You get in there also.
[08:01.380 --> 08:02.100]  We're just...
[08:02.100 --> 08:03.380]  We're just gonna...
[08:03.380 --> 08:04.960]  We're just gonna do it this way.
[08:05.640 --> 08:06.080]  Okay.
[08:09.760 --> 08:10.300]  Nice and easy.
[08:10.440 --> 08:11.200]  Just knocking him...
[08:11.200 --> 08:12.680]  Bringing him up, knocking him down.
[08:13.180 --> 08:14.240]  Heads up, gassy hands.
[08:14.260 --> 08:14.920]  You guys...
[08:14.920 --> 08:18.080]  You guys are like Seal Team Six with Osama Bin Laden.
[08:18.200 --> 08:19.460]  You're just throwing bodies out in the ocean.
[08:20.180 --> 08:20.940]  Oh, no.
[08:21.540 --> 08:21.980]  All right.
[08:22.400 --> 08:24.660]  I was really curious where you were gonna go with that.
[08:25.900 --> 08:27.120]  A little worried.
[08:27.480 --> 08:27.700]  Mm-hmm.
[08:30.800 --> 08:31.240]  Let's...
[08:31.880 --> 08:33.620]  Let's say fuck you to regulation.
[08:34.040 --> 08:34.380]  Oh, wow!
[08:35.380 --> 08:36.180]  Oh, three.
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.480]  Let's just take him out.
[08:37.680 --> 08:38.560]  I mean...
[08:38.560 --> 08:39.620]  I get it.
[08:40.440 --> 08:40.920]  Oh!
[08:41.500 --> 08:41.980]  Wow.
[08:42.180 --> 08:42.480]  No!
[08:43.300 --> 08:43.580]  Wow!
[08:43.580 --> 08:44.780]  Why won't you die?
[08:44.800 --> 08:45.080]  Really?
[08:46.420 --> 08:47.440]  Well, that was...
[08:47.440 --> 08:48.200]  That offended me.
[08:48.280 --> 08:49.340]  Oh, my God.
[08:49.980 --> 08:50.840]  That's crazy.
[08:53.480 --> 08:53.960]  Well...
[08:53.960 --> 08:55.700]  Oh, now you're just gonna get out of the hole.
[08:55.840 --> 08:56.560]  God damn it.
[08:58.280 --> 08:59.000]  See how...
[08:59.000 --> 08:59.500]  Wait a second.
[08:59.820 --> 09:00.840]  See how this is going.
[09:03.740 --> 09:04.960]  Oh, he's turtling.
[09:05.240 --> 09:05.960]  Uh-oh.
[09:06.540 --> 09:07.240]  Oh, no.
[09:08.780 --> 09:09.840]  I don't like that.
[09:12.680 --> 09:14.480]  I don't like being attacked.
[09:15.040 --> 09:16.080]  I'm being honest with you.
[09:16.100 --> 09:16.960]  Welcome to the game.
[09:19.080 --> 09:20.920]  I don't know why you're here, if that's the case.
[09:21.000 --> 09:21.760]  You know what they say?
[09:21.860 --> 09:23.720]  The best offense is a good defense.
[09:24.120 --> 09:24.660]  Is that what they say?
[09:24.740 --> 09:25.080]  Oh, yeah.
[09:25.340 --> 09:26.380]  A lot of people say that.
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.400]  A lot of people on the internet say that.
[09:28.940 --> 09:29.340]  Interesting.
[09:31.140 --> 09:32.380]  I like your hamburger.
[09:34.460 --> 09:35.460]  Oh, Nick's icon.
[09:35.660 --> 09:36.140]  Oh, thank you.
[09:36.280 --> 09:36.460]  Yeah.
[09:36.500 --> 09:38.620]  I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[09:38.640 --> 09:39.960]  The only hamburger on screen.
[09:40.180 --> 09:40.620]  Yeah.
[09:40.700 --> 09:43.660]  Well, now that you mention it, it does check out.
[09:44.500 --> 09:45.660]  Let's see here.
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.600]  I don't recognize this map as much as I've played Worms W.
[09:49.640 --> 09:50.460]  I'm sure I've played it before.
[09:50.580 --> 09:51.120]  That's crazy.
[09:52.640 --> 09:53.480]  Oh, wow.
[09:53.520 --> 09:54.200]  It doesn't look familiar.
[09:56.820 --> 09:57.480]  Love it.
[09:58.480 --> 09:58.880]  Wow.
[10:04.450 --> 10:04.850]  Um...
[10:04.850 --> 10:05.390]  Yeah, sure.
[10:06.610 --> 10:07.010]  26?
[10:10.770 --> 10:12.370]  Admittedly, I thought it would go through.
[10:12.830 --> 10:12.890]  Yep.
[10:13.170 --> 10:13.590]  I understand.
[10:15.090 --> 10:15.830]  Wow, I got it.
[10:15.870 --> 10:16.670]  I have this guy again?
[10:17.150 --> 10:17.310]  Damn.
[10:19.630 --> 10:20.830]  Oh, what do I want to do?
[10:20.870 --> 10:22.870]  What do I want to do here, boys?
[10:23.010 --> 10:24.310]  That's the question, isn't it?
[10:24.410 --> 10:24.870]  Let's think.
[10:24.870 --> 10:25.670]  It's the big one.
[10:26.210 --> 10:27.010]  Let's think.
[10:27.490 --> 10:28.370]  If I go...
[10:28.370 --> 10:31.290]  I mean, that just sets up.
[10:31.330 --> 10:33.070]  That's so tough, you know?
[10:35.510 --> 10:36.390]  That's there.
[10:37.610 --> 10:38.990]  No, I don't want that.
[10:40.890 --> 10:41.330]  Hmm...
[10:41.330 --> 10:42.370]  I do think...
[10:43.250 --> 10:45.370]  What I have to do here...
[10:47.470 --> 10:49.490]  I like that you're giving it good consideration.
[10:49.630 --> 10:50.050]  Well, I'm thinking.
[10:50.190 --> 10:50.890]  I'm thinking, you know?
[10:51.530 --> 10:51.610]  Yeah.
[10:52.010 --> 10:55.550]  You gotta think about who's for you, who's against you.
[10:55.770 --> 10:56.610]  What we're doing here.
[10:57.950 --> 10:58.310]  So...
[10:58.310 --> 10:59.710]  I think I'm locked in now.
[10:59.930 --> 11:00.310]  I think...
[11:00.310 --> 11:00.870]  Oh, shit.
[11:01.150 --> 11:01.910]  I think I figured it out.
[11:02.830 --> 11:04.110]  Can you launch one of those?
[11:04.130 --> 11:05.010]  I think so, yeah.
[11:05.190 --> 11:06.010]  I'm gonna give it a try.
[11:06.410 --> 11:07.010]  What is that?
[11:07.090 --> 11:08.370]  Do I have one of those?
[11:08.610 --> 11:09.530]  You have to make it.
[11:09.610 --> 11:10.250]  You have to craft it.
[11:12.990 --> 11:13.710]  Oh, crafting.
[11:13.890 --> 11:14.130]  Yeah.
[11:14.430 --> 11:16.870]  I was just in the process of crafting.
[11:17.670 --> 11:18.270]  Dismantling stuff.
[11:18.310 --> 11:18.890]  Well, there you go.
[11:19.610 --> 11:20.190]  There we go.
[11:21.450 --> 11:22.790]  What do I want to do?
[11:28.710 --> 11:30.290]  We're gonna get some...
[11:30.290 --> 11:30.410]  Nope.
[11:30.690 --> 11:30.910]  Nope.
[11:31.030 --> 11:31.350]  Uh-oh.
[11:31.590 --> 11:31.950]  Okay.
[11:32.230 --> 11:33.290]  That was...
[11:33.290 --> 11:34.590]  That felt like it was close for you, bud.
[11:35.510 --> 11:36.410]  It was.
[11:37.050 --> 11:38.450]  I'm gonna get some supplies.
[11:38.770 --> 11:39.830]  Oh, that was smart.
[11:40.370 --> 11:40.890]  Yeah, that was...
[11:40.890 --> 11:41.490]  Oh, my God.
[11:43.070 --> 11:43.550]  Wow.
[11:43.910 --> 11:45.470]  That was a pretty cool move, dude.
[11:47.450 --> 11:48.350]  I ain't done.
[11:48.690 --> 11:49.410]  I was crafting.
[11:49.410 --> 11:50.890]  I ain't done with these cool moves.
[11:52.530 --> 11:53.010]  Wow.
[11:53.850 --> 11:54.030]  Wow.
[11:54.030 --> 11:55.030]  Look at him go.
[11:55.030 --> 11:56.030]  Uh-oh.
[11:57.650 --> 11:58.290]  Wow.
[11:59.090 --> 12:00.050]  Those pretty cool moves.
[12:03.760 --> 12:04.040]  Okay.
[12:04.660 --> 12:05.020]  Okay.
[12:05.460 --> 12:05.840]  Okay.
[12:07.340 --> 12:09.520]  There's no fucking shot.
[12:09.860 --> 12:10.840]  No shot.
[12:11.340 --> 12:12.580]  What do you have against me?
[12:12.580 --> 12:13.020]  No chance.
[12:13.540 --> 12:14.080]  There's no...
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.020]  Regulation worm, zero, zero, zero...
[12:16.020 --> 12:16.500]  There's no...
[12:16.500 --> 12:16.920]  What do you...
[12:16.920 --> 12:17.240]  No!
[12:17.760 --> 12:18.080]  No!
[12:19.420 --> 12:21.280]  How are you both still alive?
[12:21.320 --> 12:21.580]  How?
[12:21.900 --> 12:24.760]  Both of us are not gonna be alive for a very long time.
[12:24.760 --> 12:25.080]  What hit?
[12:25.080 --> 12:28.200]  Where was the missile? Where did the missile land?
[12:29.180 --> 12:30.560]  Oh, it went top-right.
[12:30.920 --> 12:36.360]  It went top-right to RW00000000001.
[12:37.100 --> 12:38.080]  Oh, wow, Geoff.
[12:38.600 --> 12:41.700]  Oh, no. Oh, no. No!
[12:43.880 --> 12:45.680]  Do it. Do it. Do it.
[12:48.120 --> 12:49.880]  But he got all the health!
[12:52.040 --> 12:53.240]  He's so healthy!
[12:56.180 --> 12:57.180]  He feels so useful.
[12:57.600 --> 12:58.820]  No! No!
[12:59.960 --> 13:01.060]  Oh, you're so dead.
[13:04.400 --> 13:06.340]  That's okay. That's okay.
[13:06.820 --> 13:09.540]  I just wanted to hurt him a little bit on the way out.
[13:12.540 --> 13:13.600]  Alright, Timmy's time.
[13:15.040 --> 13:18.160]  Dude, look at that. Down there, you got that tank right there. Oh, my God.
[13:19.460 --> 13:21.460]  Oh, look at that. Lined up.
[13:21.760 --> 13:22.000]  No!
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.320]  Oh, my God.
[13:24.900 --> 13:26.740]  What happened, Nick?
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.120]  That was political.
[13:30.800 --> 13:31.760]  What the fuck?
[13:32.120 --> 13:34.500]  Admittedly, that was not my intent.
[13:34.520 --> 13:36.880]  You missed! You missed!
[13:37.460 --> 13:38.620]  Well, did I?
[13:40.740 --> 13:42.100]  Oh, my God.
[13:45.060 --> 13:46.760]  What the fuck?
[13:46.940 --> 13:48.280]  That was great.
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.360]  Jesus.
[13:54.940 --> 13:55.940]  That was awful.
[13:58.220 --> 13:59.260]  I had a good time.
[14:05.140 --> 14:06.940]  I'm just going to give this a shot.
[14:07.240 --> 14:08.340]  It's going to hit the tank, I think.
[14:08.340 --> 14:12.980]  Yeah, it's going to hit the tank first. I was hoping some wind was going to catch it. Didn't happen.
[14:13.600 --> 14:15.140]  15! What a waste.
[14:15.540 --> 14:16.560]  Yeah, what a waste.
[14:16.860 --> 14:17.640]  Absolute waste.
[14:21.020 --> 14:22.560]  Oh, Andrew, you got new weapons, buddy.
[14:24.720 --> 14:26.460]  Am I next on the field?
[14:27.400 --> 14:29.120]  I believe you are.
[14:29.460 --> 14:32.140]  Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah. Give me those crates.
[14:32.500 --> 14:34.020]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[14:37.140 --> 14:38.900]  Slowly, slowly shimmy down.
[14:39.140 --> 14:39.480]  You're getting there.
[14:40.260 --> 14:40.880]  You're getting there.
[14:43.360 --> 14:45.620]  Yep, there you go.
[14:46.080 --> 14:47.120]  There you go. Nailed it.
[14:48.360 --> 14:50.240]  Looking good. Got that crate.
[14:50.540 --> 14:52.220]  Look at that. Look at him go!
[14:52.960 --> 14:54.360]  Wow, you have become...
[14:54.360 --> 14:57.340]  Look at that. Tony is right there.
[14:58.860 --> 14:59.680]  Tony's your friend.
[15:00.020 --> 15:01.340]  You ever hit a home run, Andrew?
[15:02.700 --> 15:05.880]  Oh, you're about to see it with a fucking flame hand.
[15:06.180 --> 15:09.580]  Hey, I'm dabbing free. Remember when I got lit on fire?
[15:13.780 --> 15:14.880]  It's fine, he's dead.
[15:15.120 --> 15:16.060]  That had to be enough.
[15:17.100 --> 15:19.320]  He only had 37. That had to be...
[15:19.320 --> 15:19.860]  30!
[15:19.860 --> 15:20.820]  Oh, come on!
[15:21.200 --> 15:22.420]  I live.
[15:24.200 --> 15:24.660]  Uh-oh.
[15:25.420 --> 15:26.760]  Oh, I have new worms available.
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.320]  New weapons available.
[15:28.400 --> 15:29.280]  New worms!
[15:31.100 --> 15:32.060]  Drop it in!
[15:32.460 --> 15:36.000]  I don't know that I've been okay in a while, if I'm being honest with you.
[15:37.480 --> 15:39.020]  Okay, where am I? This guy...
[15:48.830 --> 15:49.930]  Here he comes.
[15:51.350 --> 15:52.470]  We'll go, uh...
[15:53.910 --> 15:55.010]  Yeah, go away.
[15:56.330 --> 15:58.570]  You're good. Yeah, you got it, you got it, you got it.
[15:59.110 --> 16:00.470]  There you go!
[16:01.570 --> 16:02.970]  Hi-fucking-ya!
[16:03.550 --> 16:03.990]  No!
[16:06.130 --> 16:07.070]  Fire punch!
[16:07.670 --> 16:08.190]  Wow!
[16:08.770 --> 16:09.010]  Oh!
[16:12.390 --> 16:13.850]  That was just mean.
[16:14.330 --> 16:14.910]  I liked it.
[16:15.670 --> 16:17.210]  44! Wow.
[16:17.970 --> 16:19.110]  You do what you gotta do to survive.
[16:19.110 --> 16:20.710]  Remember when the other one only did, like, 32?
[16:22.870 --> 16:23.310]  Yeah.
[16:23.810 --> 16:24.230]  Alright.
[16:27.030 --> 16:28.070]  Tommy's at the bottom.
[16:29.270 --> 16:29.990]  That's... what do you mean?
[16:29.990 --> 16:30.370]  Is that you, Eric?
[16:30.530 --> 16:30.770]  Yeah.
[16:31.630 --> 16:32.470]  Right below?
[16:32.690 --> 16:32.910]  Yeah.
[16:32.990 --> 16:33.530]  Just chillin'?
[16:33.530 --> 16:34.390]  Yeah, I'm down there.
[16:38.170 --> 16:39.370]  Was that a homing missile?
[16:40.290 --> 16:40.910]  Yeah, maybe.
[16:41.790 --> 16:42.290]  It might be.
[16:42.830 --> 16:43.230]  What?
[16:46.730 --> 16:47.530]  Yeah, let's...
[16:48.170 --> 16:49.610]  Take a little look-see here.
[16:49.690 --> 16:50.250]  Uh-huh.
[16:51.150 --> 16:52.010]  Oh, what the?
[16:52.470 --> 16:52.870]  Did it do it?
[16:53.070 --> 16:54.650]  I think it might be a homing missile.
[16:56.850 --> 16:57.250]  Wow.
[17:00.470 --> 17:00.870]  Well...
[17:00.870 --> 17:01.490]  12!
[17:04.050 --> 17:04.450]  Unfortunately...
[17:04.450 --> 17:05.550]  You made him safer.
[17:06.430 --> 17:06.830]  I...
[17:08.250 --> 17:08.650]  Well...
[17:08.650 --> 17:11.270]  Unfortunately, he was new to town and couldn't quite remember where he lived.
[17:11.710 --> 17:12.150]  Yeah.
[17:14.730 --> 17:15.350]  Uh-oh.
[17:16.910 --> 17:18.690]  I feel bad for Gassy Handies.
[17:20.390 --> 17:21.310]  Dude, if you hit that...
[17:21.930 --> 17:22.710]  Yeah, I'm trying.
[17:22.850 --> 17:23.590]  That green barrel too...
[17:23.590 --> 17:23.830]  Oh, I'm trying.
[17:24.130 --> 17:24.910]  That's brutal.
[17:24.910 --> 17:25.950]  Damn, I can't quite get there.
[17:26.470 --> 17:27.050]  Oh, you will.
[17:27.690 --> 17:28.250]  Yeah, that's good.
[17:28.730 --> 17:29.090]  That's good.
[17:29.090 --> 17:29.510]  Damn it!
[17:30.430 --> 17:31.590]  Inching ever closer.
[17:32.190 --> 17:32.730]  There you go!
[17:34.710 --> 17:35.610]  Oh, yeah!
[17:36.330 --> 17:36.770]  Oh!
[17:37.070 --> 17:38.090]  Oh, my God!
[17:38.090 --> 17:40.490]  Just bury him!
[17:40.930 --> 17:42.010]  Oh, my God!
[17:42.250 --> 17:43.610]  Just bury him!
[17:43.990 --> 17:44.850]  Jesus Christ!
[17:44.850 --> 17:45.910]  Andrew, do you think that was enough?
[17:46.990 --> 17:47.590]  No!
[17:49.450 --> 17:52.470]  Oh, my God!
[17:52.470 --> 17:54.190]  Oh, my God!
[17:56.110 --> 17:57.310]  What a...
[17:57.310 --> 17:58.550]  Oh, man!
[17:59.190 --> 17:59.910]  Holy shit.
[18:00.610 --> 18:02.250]  All right, Andrew, what's your plan?
[18:02.410 --> 18:03.690]  You're all the way down here.
[18:03.890 --> 18:05.130]  What is the goal here?
[18:05.130 --> 18:09.110]  My plan is to rock it up once again.
[18:09.190 --> 18:10.350]  Wow, look at him.
[18:12.310 --> 18:13.250]  Look at him go.
[18:13.910 --> 18:15.350]  Look at that.
[18:16.270 --> 18:16.610]  Almost!
[18:16.770 --> 18:17.510]  Oh, no!
[18:18.230 --> 18:20.510]  Now, I will say, saw that coming.
[18:23.110 --> 18:26.350]  I tried to see if that's where I needed to go for the crate.
[18:27.010 --> 18:28.490]  It ran out.
[18:31.430 --> 18:32.390]  Oh, fuck.
[18:33.230 --> 18:34.470]  I can't believe it.
[18:34.470 --> 18:35.370]  That was insane.
[18:36.090 --> 18:37.590]  Oh, my God!
[18:38.230 --> 18:41.450]  Leave me alone for one turn!
[18:44.670 --> 18:45.710]  That was it?
[18:46.550 --> 18:47.850]  Yeah, that was it.
[18:47.870 --> 18:49.050]  He didn't take it directly.
[18:49.050 --> 18:50.490]  I'm a broken man.
[18:50.990 --> 18:52.830]  There's nothing more to take from me.
[18:53.030 --> 18:55.350]  Nick, you gotta make something happen here with this five.
[18:55.610 --> 18:56.810]  You know what I mean?
[18:56.970 --> 18:58.530]  Yeah, I really gotta.
[18:58.950 --> 19:02.350]  If Andrew were the giving tree, he'd be a stump right now.
[19:03.770 --> 19:05.250]  We're on the last page.
[19:08.550 --> 19:09.350]  Oh, shit.
[19:09.990 --> 19:10.750]  Well, wow.
[19:10.850 --> 19:11.410]  No, no, you're good.
[19:11.450 --> 19:11.730]  You're good.
[19:11.770 --> 19:12.150]  You're good.
[19:12.230 --> 19:13.030]  You're good.
[19:13.270 --> 19:15.930]  Where the hell did my rockets go?
[19:16.850 --> 19:17.890]  Eric's a rip-off.
[19:19.570 --> 19:21.910]  Where the hell did my rockets go?
[19:31.750 --> 19:33.150]  Let's fucking send it.
[19:35.830 --> 19:36.830]  Just send it.
[19:36.970 --> 19:37.650]  Get out of here.
[19:42.470 --> 19:44.330]  Jesus, this is my only worm left.
[19:44.470 --> 19:45.130]  Yeah, no, you got it.
[19:45.130 --> 19:45.810]  You got it right here.
[19:47.610 --> 19:50.110]  Time to start building a fallout shelter.
[19:51.350 --> 19:52.270]  You guys watch Fallout?
[19:52.910 --> 19:55.250]  Yeah, I've watched the first three episodes so far.
[19:55.790 --> 19:57.850]  Yeah, I think I've watched the first four.
[19:57.990 --> 19:59.150]  It's fucking awesome.
[19:59.570 --> 20:00.830]  Yeah, it's good.
[20:01.490 --> 20:04.070]  I think it does a lot of stuff really well.
[20:04.070 --> 20:06.490]  And then it does other stuff where you go like, oh, that's right.
[20:06.530 --> 20:13.310]  I don't really like watching a lot of TV because it overextends in some CG and stunts.
[20:13.410 --> 20:15.770]  And you go, boy, this is a TV show.
[20:16.230 --> 20:18.530]  And then there's other parts where you go, man, this is a movie.
[20:19.030 --> 20:20.190]  And I like the dog.
[20:20.670 --> 20:20.890]  The dog's cool.
[20:20.950 --> 20:22.130]  You've just about got this figured out.
[20:22.710 --> 20:23.410]  You got it right here.
[20:23.470 --> 20:24.070]  There you go.
[20:24.190 --> 20:25.070]  There you go.
[20:25.530 --> 20:25.850]  No.
[20:27.410 --> 20:27.930]  That's all right.
[20:27.950 --> 20:28.570]  You know how to do it.
[20:28.570 --> 20:29.030]  You've got it.
[20:29.070 --> 20:29.570]  You got it.
[20:29.890 --> 20:30.530]  You got it.
[20:30.950 --> 20:31.250]  You got it.
[20:31.250 --> 20:31.370]  Ready?
[20:31.530 --> 20:31.910]  Boom!
[20:32.490 --> 20:33.290]  There you go.
[20:33.350 --> 20:33.870]  Way to go, bud.
[20:34.370 --> 20:35.310]  Way to go, dude.
[20:36.170 --> 20:37.790]  Now go ahead and jump up there.
[20:37.930 --> 20:38.130]  Yep.
[20:38.410 --> 20:38.690]  Okay.
[20:39.110 --> 20:39.810]  There you go.
[20:39.950 --> 20:40.650]  Back to where you started.
[20:41.090 --> 20:41.490]  Excellent.
[20:42.110 --> 20:42.590]  Way to go, dude.
[20:42.610 --> 20:43.370]  Back to my home.
[20:43.590 --> 20:43.910]  Beautiful.
[20:44.190 --> 20:44.890]  You're good, dude.
[20:46.330 --> 20:46.990]  Congratulations, man.
[20:47.230 --> 20:47.610]  Yeah, man.
[20:49.030 --> 20:51.650]  I just probably like episode five or six of that show.
[20:51.830 --> 20:55.430]  They do the best TV version of a side quest I've ever seen.
[20:55.470 --> 20:55.890]  Oh, really?
[20:56.050 --> 20:56.330]  That's cool.
[20:56.350 --> 20:59.770]  It is so clearly like this is a side quest in a Fallout game.
[20:59.770 --> 21:00.610]  This is great.
[21:00.930 --> 21:03.270]  Is it the one where they talk about it being a side quest where he's like,
[21:03.590 --> 21:06.630]  just when you think you're going, you got your mission all figured out,
[21:06.750 --> 21:09.670]  the fucking world throws curveballs at you?
[21:09.750 --> 21:10.030]  Oh, okay.
[21:10.830 --> 21:11.870]  And you haven't encountered it yet.
[21:14.530 --> 21:17.630]  I mean, I have one worm left.
[21:18.830 --> 21:19.370]  Oh, right.
[21:19.470 --> 21:20.150]  I forgot about that.
[21:20.270 --> 21:20.730]  I'm sorry.
[21:21.710 --> 21:22.850]  I should have gone after someone.
[21:22.870 --> 21:23.190]  He lived.
[21:23.370 --> 21:24.810]  I'm barely alive.
[21:28.630 --> 21:29.450]  I'm home.
[21:29.710 --> 21:32.890]  Chef is ripping the newspaper I was using as a blanket.
[21:33.090 --> 21:33.210]  Yeah.
[21:33.210 --> 21:34.850]  I'm not in a worse enough situation.
[21:36.090 --> 21:37.050]  Oh, keep going, Nick.
[21:37.410 --> 21:37.750]  Fuck it.
[21:37.790 --> 21:38.050]  No!
[21:38.150 --> 21:38.430]  Boom.
[21:39.150 --> 21:40.670]  Oh, he literally kept going.
[21:40.930 --> 21:41.470]  Uh-oh.
[21:42.530 --> 21:42.850]  Hello.
[21:47.270 --> 21:47.750]  Ooh.
[21:47.970 --> 21:48.550]  Oh, wow.
[21:49.070 --> 21:50.710]  There's your answer right there, Andrew.
[21:50.970 --> 21:51.010]  Yep.
[21:56.670 --> 21:57.170]  All right.
[21:57.350 --> 21:57.950]  Let's see.
[21:57.950 --> 22:02.470]  Do we have it turned on where at some point Armageddon happens and it starts to sink?
[22:02.810 --> 22:03.590]  I think so.
[22:03.970 --> 22:05.110]  Hey, what's the button to flip?
[22:05.330 --> 22:06.250]  Time just ran out.
[22:07.850 --> 22:08.550]  What was it?
[22:09.690 --> 22:10.470]  Right bumper.
[22:10.710 --> 22:12.110]  It turns which way it comes in from.
[22:12.570 --> 22:13.010]  Oh, boy.
[22:13.230 --> 22:13.550]  There we go.
[22:14.390 --> 22:14.650]  Oof.
[22:14.810 --> 22:15.070]  Wow.
[22:15.610 --> 22:17.270]  Damn, those things are fucking...
[22:17.270 --> 22:18.390]  Dude, that tank's heavy.
[22:19.430 --> 22:20.450]  Yeah, it's a heavy tank.
[22:23.430 --> 22:23.990]  Oh, damn.
[22:24.010 --> 22:24.850]  I know what it is.
[22:25.870 --> 22:26.310]  Mmm.
[22:27.490 --> 22:28.090]  Oh, God.
[22:28.090 --> 22:30.190]  Andrew can easily just hop on over to Batgirl.
[22:31.010 --> 22:32.290]  Uh, get in that helicopter.
[22:33.570 --> 22:34.390]  Go get that crate.
[22:35.090 --> 22:35.330]  Probably help.
[22:35.330 --> 22:35.890]  Yeah, here he goes.
[22:37.750 --> 22:38.630]  Try and...
[22:39.710 --> 22:40.610]  Please end up back down there.
[22:40.610 --> 22:40.870]  No!
[22:41.170 --> 22:41.610]  Please.
[22:41.710 --> 22:42.110]  No, you got this.
[22:42.110 --> 22:42.390]  No!
[22:43.030 --> 22:44.030]  I'm fucking begging you.
[22:44.510 --> 22:46.150]  Begging you to end up back down there.
[22:46.230 --> 22:46.370]  No!
[22:46.370 --> 22:46.750]  Please.
[22:48.210 --> 22:48.990]  Come on!
[22:49.390 --> 22:49.650]  Okay.
[22:49.910 --> 22:50.170]  Okay.
[22:50.970 --> 22:51.350]  Oh!
[22:51.350 --> 22:51.390]  Oh!
[22:53.650 --> 22:54.130]  Come on!
[22:55.710 --> 22:56.890]  Swing, swing, swing.
[22:57.190 --> 22:57.590]  Little wiggle.
[22:57.890 --> 22:58.050]  Wiggle.
[22:59.050 --> 22:59.530]  Come on.
[22:59.610 --> 23:00.010]  You got it.
[23:00.090 --> 23:00.590]  Yeah, you got it.
[23:00.590 --> 23:00.910]  A little more.
[23:01.090 --> 23:01.570]  Just a little more.
[23:01.690 --> 23:02.030]  Just a little.
[23:02.110 --> 23:02.470]  There you go.
[23:02.530 --> 23:02.870]  There you go.
[23:02.890 --> 23:03.230]  There you go.
[23:03.250 --> 23:03.490]  Almost.
[23:03.610 --> 23:03.850]  Almost.
[23:04.170 --> 23:04.410]  Almost.
[23:04.410 --> 23:04.430]  Almost.
[23:04.430 --> 23:05.030]  Oh, dude, you got it.
[23:05.310 --> 23:06.470]  Nick, you have to encourage him.
[23:06.550 --> 23:08.210]  When you get it on the upswing, you got to really...
[23:08.470 --> 23:08.930]  You got it.
[23:08.930 --> 23:09.290]  You got it.
[23:09.310 --> 23:09.510]  You got it.
[23:09.510 --> 23:09.810]  You got it.
[23:09.870 --> 23:10.130]  You got it.
[23:10.790 --> 23:11.590]  You can do it.
[23:11.590 --> 23:11.910]  Come on.
[23:12.190 --> 23:13.350]  How is this so easy?
[23:13.350 --> 23:14.490]  Just give it a little bit more.
[23:14.890 --> 23:15.410]  You just need...
[23:15.410 --> 23:16.130]  How is this so easy?
[23:16.210 --> 23:16.690]  Yeah, there you go.
[23:16.750 --> 23:17.030]  There you go.
[23:17.030 --> 23:17.410]  Right there.
[23:17.530 --> 23:17.610]  Nope.
[23:17.670 --> 23:18.010]  Nope.
[23:18.130 --> 23:18.530]  Okay.
[23:20.210 --> 23:21.330]  That's it right there, buddy.
[23:22.110 --> 23:22.510]  Nice.
[23:23.370 --> 23:23.870]  Good shot.
[23:24.750 --> 23:24.970]  Yup.
[23:25.110 --> 23:25.330]  Yup.
[23:25.570 --> 23:25.830]  Yup.
[23:26.070 --> 23:26.890]  You got it.
[23:27.510 --> 23:28.830]  What video games?
[23:29.410 --> 23:30.490]  Video games are dumb.
[23:34.670 --> 23:35.070]  Alright.
[23:36.130 --> 23:36.570]  Regulate your...
[23:36.570 --> 23:37.910]  I hate video games.
[23:38.470 --> 23:38.830]  No.
[23:39.330 --> 23:40.350]  Do you think I can make this fall?
[23:40.350 --> 23:40.950]  Yeah.
[23:41.530 --> 23:41.810]  Yeah.
[23:41.950 --> 23:42.350]  Definitely.
[23:43.370 --> 23:44.390]  You think you can't?
[23:46.190 --> 23:47.290]  I'll perish.
[23:47.410 --> 23:47.670]  Be safe.
[23:48.890 --> 23:49.090]  Oh.
[23:57.540 --> 23:58.340]  Uh-oh.
[23:59.060 --> 24:00.280]  What the...
[24:00.280 --> 24:01.320]  Holy shit!
[24:04.160 --> 24:05.180]  Uh-oh.
[24:07.460 --> 24:11.140]  All you did was blow up the box I was trying to get.
[24:12.900 --> 24:13.240]  Why?
[24:16.420 --> 24:19.500]  This is so funny.
[24:20.700 --> 24:22.020]  Hey, Tony time.
[24:22.960 --> 24:23.920]  It's teeny tiny Tony.
[24:25.080 --> 24:25.940]  Boned, let's see.
[24:26.160 --> 24:27.480]  Build a girder to cross over.
[24:27.820 --> 24:28.980]  Yeah, you got it, teeny tiny Tony.
[24:29.040 --> 24:29.560]  You got it.
[24:30.280 --> 24:31.180]  Or you could jet pack.
[24:31.680 --> 24:32.360]  There you go.
[24:32.540 --> 24:33.360]  Nailed it, nailed it, nailed it.
[24:33.360 --> 24:33.760]  There you go.
[24:33.800 --> 24:34.640]  All the way up, all the way up.
[24:34.640 --> 24:35.620]  You gotta hold it, you gotta hold it.
[24:35.860 --> 24:36.660]  You gotta hold it.
[24:36.940 --> 24:37.200]  You gotta hold it.
[24:37.200 --> 24:38.360]  You gotta go in a direction.
[24:38.520 --> 24:38.960]  You gotta hold it.
[24:38.960 --> 24:39.860]  You gotta hold it.
[24:40.220 --> 24:41.180]  I'm not sure.
[24:42.540 --> 24:43.060]  I'm not sure.
[24:43.060 --> 24:43.480]  I was holding it.
[24:43.600 --> 24:44.040]  Nothing happened.
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.320]  What was unclear?
[24:46.300 --> 24:48.240]  I was holding the cable.
[24:48.700 --> 24:50.380]  He went through like four...
[24:50.380 --> 24:53.800]  He went through four jet packs and then went down.
[24:54.100 --> 24:55.040]  I just...
[24:55.040 --> 24:57.220]  Oh my gosh.
[24:57.740 --> 24:59.900]  Well, that's a user error on that one, I'm afraid.
[25:00.360 --> 25:01.120]  Oh, boy.
[25:02.540 --> 25:03.000]  Like, Nick.
[25:04.460 --> 25:05.820]  Yeah, it wasn't good, Eric.
[25:06.000 --> 25:06.280]  No.
[25:06.400 --> 25:06.940]  Wasn't good.
[25:17.520 --> 25:18.940]  A little bit.
[25:18.940 --> 25:19.660]  A little more.
[25:20.060 --> 25:20.560]  A little more.
[25:20.920 --> 25:21.660]  A little...
[25:21.660 --> 25:23.800]  I don't know that that's gonna quite do it, but we're gonna give it a shot.
[25:23.820 --> 25:23.980]  That's it.
[25:25.240 --> 25:25.600]  Oof.
[25:26.320 --> 25:26.900]  Andrew, I...
[25:26.900 --> 25:28.180]  Andrew, I elevated you.
[25:29.400 --> 25:30.320]  You're up high now.
[25:30.320 --> 25:30.500]  You killed me.
[25:30.600 --> 25:30.860]  Fuck.
[25:31.120 --> 25:31.480]  What do you mean?
[25:31.500 --> 25:32.020]  You fuck.
[25:32.160 --> 25:32.780]  You got one!
[25:32.860 --> 25:33.420]  What are you talking about?
[25:33.420 --> 25:34.440]  I'm helping you.
[25:36.340 --> 25:37.340]  Oh, that's bad.
[25:37.580 --> 25:38.060]  What do you mean?
[25:38.100 --> 25:39.100]  You're still in this.
[25:39.160 --> 25:39.900]  What's the problem?
[25:40.500 --> 25:41.340]  Yeah, I don't understand.
[25:41.640 --> 25:41.880]  Yeah.
[25:42.160 --> 25:42.520]  What's...
[25:42.520 --> 25:43.240]  I don't...
[25:43.240 --> 25:44.520]  I just don't get what the issue is.
[25:44.700 --> 25:46.780]  And look, you have a box over there to the left.
[25:46.780 --> 25:49.060]  Like, there's so much happening, Andrew.
[25:49.480 --> 25:50.520]  There's so much you can do still.
[25:50.660 --> 25:50.720]  Oh, my God.
[25:50.720 --> 25:51.600]  There's so much you can do.
[25:51.980 --> 25:52.840]  You have a helicopter.
[25:53.460 --> 25:53.780]  Yeah.
[25:54.040 --> 25:54.680]  Oh, you took it?
[25:55.060 --> 25:55.380]  Yeah.
[25:56.220 --> 25:57.800]  I delivered it to him to help him out.
[25:57.800 --> 25:57.880]  Yeah.
[25:57.960 --> 25:59.080]  He was having so much trouble getting there.
[25:59.440 --> 26:01.800]  Oh, he's got a lot of trouble piloting it too, but he's doing great.
[26:01.920 --> 26:02.360]  Oh, my.
[26:02.680 --> 26:04.140]  I'm trying my best.
[26:04.260 --> 26:04.560]  I know.
[26:04.840 --> 26:05.300]  I'm 100% helping.
[26:05.300 --> 26:08.220]  Oh, I definitely know you're trying your best.
[26:08.680 --> 26:09.620]  Can I make a recommendation?
[26:10.180 --> 26:10.400]  Yeah.
[26:10.740 --> 26:11.000]  Yeah, of course.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.960]  Could maybe try somebody else's best?
[26:13.340 --> 26:13.560]  Yeah.
[26:14.880 --> 26:16.060]  Oh, that's a good idea, actually.
[26:17.160 --> 26:18.040]  I like it.
[26:18.360 --> 26:19.320]  Where are you going?
[26:19.320 --> 26:20.580]  I don't even see me on the screen.
[26:20.720 --> 26:21.140]  Where am I?
[26:21.520 --> 26:22.220]  Hop left.
[26:22.320 --> 26:22.760]  Go right.
[26:22.860 --> 26:23.420]  Go right.
[26:23.500 --> 26:24.160]  Go right.
[26:24.260 --> 26:25.080]  Go up and go right.
[26:25.240 --> 26:26.080]  Go up.
[26:26.820 --> 26:28.140]  Oh, my God.
[26:29.480 --> 26:30.340]  You're safe there.
[26:30.700 --> 26:30.960]  Yeah.
[26:31.180 --> 26:32.340]  Yeah, you're hunkered down.
[26:32.780 --> 26:32.860]  You'll be safe.
[26:32.860 --> 26:36.680]  I don't think that there are two tanks right next to it that can blow through that wall,
[26:36.780 --> 26:37.560]  so that should be fine.
[26:38.620 --> 26:39.360]  Yeah, you're good.
[26:41.360 --> 26:41.800]  Hmm.
[26:43.640 --> 26:43.960]  Ooh.
[26:44.720 --> 26:45.520]  Oh, wow.
[26:46.060 --> 26:48.380]  Only three minutes left on the clock, dude.
[26:57.320 --> 26:58.980]  We're going to have an old-fashioned shootout.
[26:59.480 --> 26:59.720]  Yeah.
[27:01.240 --> 27:01.720]  Draw!
[27:02.200 --> 27:03.020]  Oh, my God.
[27:03.480 --> 27:04.680]  One that you will win.
[27:09.780 --> 27:10.680]  Sixteen damage?
[27:11.040 --> 27:11.880]  Oh, my God.
[27:12.840 --> 27:13.040]  Yeah.
[27:15.160 --> 27:16.900]  Tanks don't hurt tanks very much.
[27:17.520 --> 27:18.480]  I guess not.
[27:19.120 --> 27:20.440]  How do I get out of this thing?
[27:20.580 --> 27:21.360]  That was a nice jump.
[27:24.260 --> 27:25.740]  Dude, don't do that again.
[27:27.480 --> 27:29.260]  Can you jump over to the right?
[27:29.920 --> 27:31.320]  Do you think you can clear that gap?
[27:31.800 --> 27:33.340]  Oh, he's slamming them.
[27:33.640 --> 27:33.760]  Yep.
[27:35.400 --> 27:36.700]  I'm Mario Pound.
[27:36.960 --> 27:38.140]  Are you ground pounding me?
[27:38.160 --> 27:39.260]  Softening his blows.
[27:39.420 --> 27:39.880]  What are you, Iron Man?
[27:39.880 --> 27:40.120]  Trying.
[27:42.120 --> 27:43.160]  Oh, wow.
[27:43.420 --> 27:44.180]  Oh, that was nice.
[27:44.320 --> 27:45.040]  Direct hit.
[27:45.220 --> 27:45.640]  That was great.
[27:45.640 --> 27:46.080]  Let's see if that worked.
[27:47.320 --> 27:48.120]  Is it just enough?
[27:48.260 --> 27:49.940]  The worst tank battle ever.
[27:50.060 --> 27:50.960]  Just die!
[27:50.960 --> 27:51.640]  Wow.
[27:52.140 --> 27:52.360]  Sixteen damage.
[27:53.040 --> 27:53.840]  I think it's gonna blow.
[27:53.900 --> 27:55.140]  Oh, you got me.
[27:56.800 --> 27:57.600]  Excellent job.
[27:57.700 --> 27:57.860]  Yep.
[27:58.080 --> 27:58.800]  Yeah, good job, Nick.
[27:58.800 --> 27:58.960]  Thank you.
[28:00.700 --> 28:01.940]  Down he goes.
[28:04.720 --> 28:05.560]  Who will be remembered?
[28:08.480 --> 28:09.120]  Ammunition's boost.
[28:09.800 --> 28:10.780]  Eric is such a problem.
[28:11.560 --> 28:12.380]  Yeah, he is a big problem.
[28:13.340 --> 28:13.520]  Yeah.
[28:14.160 --> 28:15.960]  He's a problem you should solve, Andrew.
[28:16.360 --> 28:17.060]  Let's not be rude to Eric.
[28:17.060 --> 28:17.840]  I'm one percent.
[28:19.780 --> 28:20.620]  You mean the elite?
[28:20.620 --> 28:21.760]  I'm one percent like Chance the Rivalry.
[28:21.940 --> 28:22.420]  The elite.
[28:22.480 --> 28:22.920]  That's what I am.
[28:28.280 --> 28:29.140]  What was that?
[28:30.880 --> 28:31.800]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[28:31.860 --> 28:32.520]  What was that, Eric?
[28:32.800 --> 28:33.380]  What was what?
[28:35.060 --> 28:36.500]  Either of those things you described.
[28:36.720 --> 28:37.320]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[28:37.380 --> 28:37.780]  Some boxes?
[28:38.480 --> 28:39.220]  Yeah, they were just like...
[28:39.220 --> 28:39.980]  I think they were just like...
[28:39.980 --> 28:40.960]  It was like food or something?
[28:41.140 --> 28:41.940]  I don't really remember.
[28:43.080 --> 28:43.440]  Um...
[28:43.440 --> 28:43.640]  Yeah.
[28:44.060 --> 28:44.300]  Easy.
[28:44.500 --> 28:45.320]  Banana bombs.
[28:46.060 --> 28:46.900]  Oof, that was rough.
[28:46.900 --> 28:47.700]  I think we're good.
[28:47.820 --> 28:48.500]  Oh, no.
[28:49.560 --> 28:50.360]  Oh, no.
[28:51.640 --> 28:53.040]  This is more submarine bullshit.
[28:54.120 --> 28:55.800]  Yeah, but I don't think I want to use that.
[28:56.320 --> 28:57.000]  No, don't use that.
[28:57.140 --> 28:58.980]  I don't like it because it feels like a murder mystery.
[28:59.380 --> 29:00.020]  Have you ever...
[29:00.020 --> 29:01.520]  Have you tried the skip and rope one?
[29:01.640 --> 29:02.160]  That's pretty cool.
[29:02.760 --> 29:03.700]  That is pretty cool.
[29:03.960 --> 29:05.320]  Bottom right.
[29:09.280 --> 29:10.080]  Fuck it.
[29:10.640 --> 29:11.540]  That was a great move right there.
[29:12.840 --> 29:14.100]  Acme versus Coyote...
[29:14.100 --> 29:16.340]  Coyote versus Acme has to protect himself.
[29:17.100 --> 29:18.080]  Oh my god.
[29:19.140 --> 29:20.420]  Didn't want to rotate that at all.
[29:21.640 --> 29:22.360]  No, rotate!
[29:25.740 --> 29:26.100]  No!
[29:28.820 --> 29:29.800]  Alright, you got this.
[29:30.400 --> 29:31.140]  I gotta go, I gotta go.
[29:31.420 --> 29:31.980]  Yeah, you do.
[29:33.760 --> 29:34.960]  Look at that, but you can fire...
[29:35.460 --> 29:36.180]  No bad!
[29:39.400 --> 29:39.920]  Get it.
[29:40.380 --> 29:41.000]  He got it!
[29:41.360 --> 29:41.720]  25!
[29:41.760 --> 29:43.260]  So we're at 26 now, guys.
[29:44.240 --> 29:44.600]  Excellent.
[29:44.940 --> 29:46.700]  I'd get back in that safe space if I were you.
[29:46.700 --> 29:47.840]  You got plenty of time.
[29:48.860 --> 29:50.740]  Probably want to take out Eric on the way, but yeah.
[29:59.080 --> 29:59.760]  Where are you going?
[30:02.540 --> 30:05.360]  I just don't know what the plant you have...
[30:05.360 --> 30:06.360]  Oh, he's trying to bunk away.
[30:06.360 --> 30:06.600]  Oh, okay.
[30:07.420 --> 30:09.060]  Oh, you're making a dick and balls.
[30:09.220 --> 30:09.600]  That's cute.
[30:11.700 --> 30:13.140]  Does yours not look like that?
[30:13.620 --> 30:15.460]  Andrew, you need to go to the doctor immediately.
[30:18.240 --> 30:19.700]  And he put the girder in.
[30:21.220 --> 30:22.360]  What is this?
[30:23.140 --> 30:24.840]  It's always important to have protection.
[30:25.520 --> 30:25.980]  I agree.
[30:26.260 --> 30:26.800]  Against your dick and balls.
[30:27.060 --> 30:27.220]  Yep.
[30:28.060 --> 30:29.140]  Alright, Geoff, what's the plan?
[30:30.640 --> 30:31.820]  Don't you do it, Geoff.
[30:32.400 --> 30:33.260]  Uh, okay, I won't.
[30:37.280 --> 30:39.220]  Well, that was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
[30:39.220 --> 30:39.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:39.860 --> 30:40.740]  These ages are great.
[30:43.420 --> 30:44.640]  All you have to do is ask.
[30:45.700 --> 30:46.300]  Let's see.
[30:47.200 --> 30:50.040]  That's the closest Nick has ever felt to having 10 charisma.
[30:50.280 --> 30:51.440]  Like a Fallout game in real life.
[30:52.680 --> 30:53.260]  Don't do it.
[30:53.320 --> 30:54.040]  That's how that works.
[30:54.140 --> 30:54.940]  You got it.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.520]  Ready, because that C level is about to rise.
[31:01.740 --> 31:02.580]  Yeah, you gotta be careful.
[31:12.330 --> 31:12.730]  Interesting.
[31:14.750 --> 31:16.090]  How do you get out of this thing?
[31:16.570 --> 31:17.030]  You don't.
[31:18.430 --> 31:19.790]  I legitimately don't know.
[31:19.810 --> 31:21.130]  I think A or Y.
[31:21.290 --> 31:22.070]  I honestly don't remember.
[31:22.150 --> 31:22.650]  X fires.
[31:22.930 --> 31:23.750]  It's not A!
[31:25.450 --> 31:26.650]  Oh, there you go.
[31:28.090 --> 31:29.430]  It's not A!
[31:30.590 --> 31:31.290]  Was it Y?
[31:32.330 --> 31:33.310]  It sure was.
[31:35.650 --> 31:36.230]  Nailed it.
[31:36.530 --> 31:37.250]  There you go.
[31:37.390 --> 31:37.950]  There you go.
[31:38.030 --> 31:38.410]  Got it.
[31:38.510 --> 31:39.770]  You got it all the way up, bud.
[31:39.850 --> 31:40.770]  Oh, there you go.
[31:41.050 --> 31:41.990]  All the way.
[31:42.470 --> 31:43.350]  There you go.
[31:43.470 --> 31:43.710]  Boom!
[31:43.810 --> 31:44.450]  All the way to the right.
[31:44.890 --> 31:45.590]  Just like that one time.
[31:45.610 --> 31:49.650]  What Andrew wasn't doing is you want to disconnect in the air with momentum.
[31:49.970 --> 31:50.890]  Yeah, you got it.
[31:51.770 --> 31:53.130]  So you just want to get a little bit of momentum.
[31:53.130 --> 31:54.210]  There you go.
[31:54.610 --> 31:55.050]  Boom!
[31:55.210 --> 31:55.730]  And then sling!
[31:55.950 --> 31:55.970]  Woo!
[31:56.670 --> 31:57.110]  Sling!
[31:58.070 --> 31:58.970]  Hold on, hold on.
[31:59.450 --> 31:59.890]  Okay, hold on.
[32:00.070 --> 32:00.930]  And then here you go.
[32:01.270 --> 32:01.590]  And sling!
[32:01.770 --> 32:02.210]  Sling!
[32:02.490 --> 32:02.930]  Sling!
[32:03.310 --> 32:05.350]  See, Andrew, you just gotta...
[32:05.350 --> 32:05.550]  Sling!
[32:08.090 --> 32:08.970]  And sling!
[32:09.310 --> 32:09.750]  God!
[32:10.670 --> 32:11.110]  Well...
[32:11.110 --> 32:11.590]  You better run.
[32:12.390 --> 32:12.830]  And...
[32:13.450 --> 32:14.450]  What is your point?
[32:14.450 --> 32:15.810]  I mean, you're doing cool rolls.
[32:16.230 --> 32:17.450]  Alright, well...
[32:17.450 --> 32:18.050]  I did it.
[32:18.410 --> 32:18.590]  Okay.
[32:18.890 --> 32:19.990]  Well, that was interesting.
[32:21.750 --> 32:22.010]  Interesting.
[32:22.010 --> 32:23.010]  I learned how to use it.
[32:23.110 --> 32:24.190]  That's the good thing.
[32:24.250 --> 32:24.630]  That's good.
[32:34.200 --> 32:35.980]  Stupid old-ass worm.
[32:36.240 --> 32:38.200]  What are you talking about?
[32:38.660 --> 32:39.860]  What are you talking about?
[32:40.560 --> 32:42.100]  Just looking at the view.
[32:42.960 --> 32:44.260]  You don't have to be mean to my worm.
[32:45.040 --> 32:46.180]  I do, actually.
[32:46.500 --> 32:46.600]  Uh-oh.
[32:47.420 --> 32:49.440]  You don't have to be mean to my worm, Andrew.
[32:50.580 --> 32:51.060]  No.
[32:54.780 --> 32:55.740]  Where's it gonna be?
[32:56.400 --> 32:56.740]  What?
[33:00.540 --> 33:01.580]  Oh, that's bad.
[33:01.780 --> 33:02.080]  There it is.
[33:02.120 --> 33:03.660]  Oh, Jesus.
[33:03.900 --> 33:05.300]  That is a lot more than I thought you were...
[33:05.300 --> 33:06.100]  There we go.
[33:06.420 --> 33:07.480]  Oh, well, that's a killer.
[33:08.000 --> 33:08.240]  Yeah.
[33:09.460 --> 33:10.300]  Oh, no!
[33:11.680 --> 33:12.020]  Uh-oh.
[33:16.510 --> 33:16.730]  Whoops.
[33:17.590 --> 33:18.270]  It's not here.
[33:23.370 --> 33:24.710]  Definitely don't let that go.
[33:25.350 --> 33:26.310]  What does that do?
[33:26.890 --> 33:28.190]  Hit X to find out.
[33:30.810 --> 33:32.390]  What the fuck?
[33:40.390 --> 33:41.210]  Oh.
[33:42.070 --> 33:43.730]  Take me home.
[33:44.330 --> 33:46.110]  The fucking girder.
[33:46.630 --> 33:47.410]  So high up.
[33:47.770 --> 33:48.990]  It's so funny.
[33:55.260 --> 33:56.120]  Oh, yeah.
[33:58.940 --> 34:00.480]  Kind of fun stuff.
[34:01.460 --> 34:02.080]  Have one of these.
[34:04.100 --> 34:04.540]  Done.
[34:08.400 --> 34:11.100]  You just didn't even put, like, a hat or anything on your little guy.
[34:11.200 --> 34:12.580]  He's just an old-ass fucking worm?
[34:12.680 --> 34:13.480]  It's a regulation worm.
[34:15.420 --> 34:16.480]  What a throw!
[34:16.780 --> 34:17.260]  Oh, no.
[34:17.500 --> 34:17.760]  No!
[34:18.600 --> 34:19.520]  Oh, wow!
[34:19.640 --> 34:20.060]  Oh!
[34:20.360 --> 34:21.280]  Oh, my God!
[34:21.800 --> 34:22.980]  Wow, that was really good.
[34:23.100 --> 34:24.400]  And it fucked you up, too.
[34:25.100 --> 34:25.340]  Oh!
[34:25.600 --> 34:26.180]  Hell yeah, dude.
[34:26.880 --> 34:27.300]  Uh-oh.
[34:28.780 --> 34:29.220]  Fuck.
[34:31.020 --> 34:31.780]  Look, crate drop.
[34:33.340 --> 34:34.160]  Oh, come on.
[34:34.340 --> 34:34.640]  Oh, once again.
[34:34.780 --> 34:35.660]  Right at Eric's feet.
[34:35.940 --> 34:36.200]  What's the problem?
[34:36.500 --> 34:37.660]  Mr. Old Man RT.
[34:37.980 --> 34:38.480]  What's the issue?
[34:38.700 --> 34:39.720]  Taking in the view.
[34:41.300 --> 34:41.880]  Let's go.
[34:42.040 --> 34:43.240]  All right, what's the plan, little worm guy?
[34:45.240 --> 34:45.600]  Survive.
[34:45.960 --> 34:48.960]  Dude, you were standing on one pixel of fucking ground there.
[34:49.100 --> 34:50.300]  I sure was, man.
[34:50.800 --> 34:51.820]  Oh, that's not what I meant to do.
[34:55.140 --> 34:55.980]  There you go.
[34:56.160 --> 34:56.940]  Oh, we're trying more rope?
[34:57.180 --> 34:57.340]  Yeah.
[34:57.420 --> 34:58.440]  He's got it right here, though.
[34:58.460 --> 34:58.860]  Yeah, you got it.
[34:58.860 --> 34:59.500]  Up a little bit.
[34:59.500 --> 35:00.380]  Dude, you got this thing.
[35:00.640 --> 35:01.080]  You got it.
[35:01.120 --> 35:01.480]  You got it.
[35:01.520 --> 35:01.900]  Almost.
[35:02.400 --> 35:02.800]  Almost.
[35:03.040 --> 35:03.440]  Almost.
[35:03.800 --> 35:04.200]  Almost.
[35:05.240 --> 35:05.280]  Almost.
[35:05.640 --> 35:06.020]  Right there.
[35:07.260 --> 35:07.660]  No!
[35:08.140 --> 35:08.160]  No!
[35:10.920 --> 35:13.620]  Well, our first elimination is Nick.
[35:20.130 --> 35:21.470]  I'm still getting used to it.
[35:21.790 --> 35:21.950]  Uh-huh.
[35:22.250 --> 35:22.850]  No, you are.
[35:23.050 --> 35:23.470]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:25.270 --> 35:26.070]  Not well.
[35:26.350 --> 35:26.630]  No.
[35:26.890 --> 35:28.630]  But you gotta aim that rope.
[35:29.350 --> 35:30.110]  Yeah, I sure do.
[35:31.170 --> 35:32.230]  Oh, my God.
[35:32.910 --> 35:33.390]  Oh!
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.980]  He's driving over him for good measure.
[35:42.200 --> 35:42.340]  Yeah.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.300]  Trying to.
[35:43.500 --> 35:46.120]  Well, that killed Coyote versus Acme.
[35:47.120 --> 35:47.800]  Seemed to.
[35:48.200 --> 35:49.100]  It died twice.
[35:49.280 --> 35:49.660]  Fuck.
[35:50.680 --> 35:51.320]  Wow, brutal.
[35:53.120 --> 35:53.940]  Oh, look at that.
[35:54.000 --> 35:54.560]  Just for Andrew.
[35:57.300 --> 36:00.200]  I'm not gonna be able to get out of my stupid fucking hole.
[36:01.260 --> 36:01.500]  Ah!
[36:02.000 --> 36:02.360]  Ah!
[36:02.360 --> 36:03.380]  Okay.
[36:04.500 --> 36:05.320]  Uh-huh.
[36:06.440 --> 36:07.980]  Get out of that drippy dick.
[36:08.160 --> 36:08.400]  Yep.
[36:08.880 --> 36:09.400]  No!
[36:09.500 --> 36:09.840]  Yes!
[36:10.960 --> 36:11.560]  Yes!
[36:13.000 --> 36:13.420]  Yes!
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.600]  Oh, my God.
[36:20.060 --> 36:21.680]  He just ate a grenade.
[36:21.920 --> 36:22.580]  That rocked you.
[36:22.660 --> 36:23.080]  Way to go.
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.140]  I hate video games.
[36:26.360 --> 36:29.140]  This is a terrible game of worms.
[36:30.300 --> 36:30.600]  Yeah.
[36:33.860 --> 36:37.320]  I guess Nick faces relegation, but, man, it feels like it should be Andrew.
[36:37.500 --> 36:38.320]  Yeah, it really does.
[36:39.200 --> 36:40.480]  Everybody beat up on me.
[36:40.540 --> 36:41.580]  What do you mean it should be me?
[36:43.300 --> 36:44.660]  Last one, the last death.
[36:45.000 --> 36:45.360]  No, no!
[36:45.440 --> 36:46.000]  Yes!
[36:46.420 --> 36:46.740]  No!
[36:47.140 --> 36:48.180]  Baby, that's right.
[36:48.440 --> 36:49.520]  A number one.
[36:50.500 --> 36:50.960]  No!
[36:52.920 --> 36:54.540]  WWE wins again.
[36:54.960 --> 36:56.220]  Michigan Jays win.
[36:56.940 --> 36:58.480]  Hello, my lady.
[36:59.080 --> 37:00.500]  Hello, my honey.
[37:00.500 --> 37:03.320]  Hello, my ragtime gal.
[37:04.480 --> 37:07.860]  The WWE does it again.
[37:09.480 --> 37:10.360]  Motherfucking bullshit!
[37:11.980 --> 37:13.020]  God damn it!
[37:13.120 --> 37:14.480]  I'm popping Chivos, too, dude.
[37:14.520 --> 37:16.060]  I got two achievements for that shit.
[37:16.140 --> 37:16.800]  That was so easy.
[37:16.860 --> 37:17.880]  That was a fucking baby game.
[37:18.080 --> 37:18.820]  Look at that stuff.
[37:19.100 --> 37:19.720]  Look at that win.
[37:20.100 --> 37:20.500]  Look at that.
[37:20.620 --> 37:25.540]  Dude, the most damage, the most kills, like, the least deaths.
[37:26.300 --> 37:27.320]  Dude, top worm.
[37:27.340 --> 37:28.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:28.480 --> 37:29.020]  Top worm.
[37:29.020 --> 37:30.560]  Good for you.
[37:31.220 --> 37:32.520]  Nick, Nick, way to go.
[37:32.600 --> 37:33.480]  The longest shot.
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.200]  I think that was probably when you were just fucking jamming on the fire button, missing with...
[37:40.200 --> 37:40.460]  No.
[37:41.220 --> 37:42.260]  Oh, when I got you?
[37:42.540 --> 37:42.980]  No.
[37:43.040 --> 37:46.020]  No, I think that was in reference to his odds of winning.
[37:46.320 --> 37:47.920]  I think he was the biggest underdog.
[37:48.900 --> 37:51.720]  Oh, boys, that was a good game of worms.
[37:52.280 --> 37:54.260]  Good game, good video.
[37:54.360 --> 37:54.600]  Yeah.
[37:54.760 --> 37:57.320]  We should maybe wrap up and maybe do another one.
[37:57.320 --> 38:00.540]  Well, thank you so much for watching this Regulation gameplay.

[38:24.800 --> 38:28.200]  So thank you so much for watching this game of worms that I won.
[38:28.460 --> 38:29.580]  Because I'm the best worm guy.
[38:29.820 --> 38:31.440]  And I think that's it.
[38:31.580 --> 38:32.200]  Anyone else?
[38:32.360 --> 38:32.880]  Parting thoughts?
[38:33.780 --> 38:34.120]  No!
[38:35.160 --> 38:35.660]  Not a bit.
[38:35.840 --> 38:36.080]  Worms is bullshit.
[38:36.560 --> 38:37.240]  Yeah, it sucks.
[38:37.720 --> 38:38.020]  Bye!
[38:38.620 --> 38:38.860]  God, Nick.
[38:39.800 --> 38:41.560]  Fucking cut my hands off!
[38:43.740 --> 38:44.980]  I'll cut my feet off.
[38:45.720 --> 38:47.480]  Give them to Gavin to suck on.
[38:47.700 --> 38:48.360]  All right, bye!
