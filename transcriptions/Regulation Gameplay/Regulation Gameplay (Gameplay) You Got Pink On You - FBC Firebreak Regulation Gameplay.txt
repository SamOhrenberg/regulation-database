[00:00.000 --> 00:04.420]  Hello and welcome to another FBC Firebreak episode 3.
[00:05.600 --> 00:12.840]  I'm really excited to play this today because I think an update came out overnight where they reduced the grind of upgrading certain materials.
[00:13.380 --> 00:20.280]  So. Oh! Is that, was that what my update was? My 500 meg update? I think so. Yeah, I think they like adjusted the perks requirements and stuff.
[00:20.360 --> 00:22.760]  I haven't like looked at the notes for it, but...
[00:23.420 --> 00:24.920]  Oh yeah, holy shit!
[00:25.940 --> 00:26.420]  Yesterday
[00:27.120 --> 00:33.940]  To get, I'm gonna upgrade my sprint right now. To get strong sprint you needed the sub material as well.
[00:34.040 --> 00:39.020]  You needed the green thing and now it's just the, the big triangle.
[00:42.640 --> 00:43.520]  The strong...
[00:43.520 --> 00:46.520]  This is great. Is that on requisitions? Where is that?
[00:47.560 --> 00:48.000]  Research.
[00:49.060 --> 00:56.240]  Research. Oh, you're starting a game. A game is starting. Oh, well, we'll do it next time. Should we be doing crew updates?
[00:57.880 --> 01:03.660]  What do you mean? Sorry. There was like a thing, like it was a crew ability that you can upgrade.
[01:04.300 --> 01:08.920]  Oh. Yeah, I, so I did one yesterday. I, you get, you can get like a super.
[01:09.400 --> 01:14.880]  I have a super now with my water gun where I put a tea kettle on it and it like burns enemies if I shoot them with it.
[01:16.220 --> 01:19.340]  What button do you push to do that? Uh, you hold Y.
[01:19.880 --> 01:25.080]  So for me, I have a, I have a little symbol in the bottom middle of my screen that is slowly recharging.
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.240]  Postulate.
[01:27.740 --> 01:33.520]  Oh, I don't want to throw this grenade. How do I unthrow? Why do you both have a white line above your blue line to me?
[01:35.840 --> 01:40.340]  Shielding maybe? Oh, I just can't see my shield there. Yeah, I can't see mine either. Okay.
[01:43.020 --> 01:46.620]  Load the shuttle with leech pearls. Are they inside the leech bags?
[01:47.080 --> 01:53.380]  I assume we got some leech baggage that we need to get rid of. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I just got one.
[01:55.080 --> 01:56.900]  I'm holding one. Oh, we got guys up ahead.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.080]  What the fuck? Oh, we got to put it in the mine cart. Oh shit.
[02:02.760 --> 02:08.700]  Okay, so the leech pearls will radiate you. Oh no. Oh, that's not good. Oh, I'm radiated. I need to get in the shower.
[02:08.820 --> 02:11.620]  I need to get in the shower. Oh, I'm getting radiated. What's radiating me?
[02:12.600 --> 02:15.740]  For me, it was the leech pearls. Yeah, leech pearls bad. But which one?
[02:17.400 --> 02:19.880]  I don't know how to answer that. Oh, it's the one on the floor?
[02:21.100 --> 02:26.660]  Yeah, why am I getting re-radiated? Because it's right in front of us. Here, I'm getting it in. I'm putting it in the thing.
[02:28.040 --> 02:33.140]  How do I? Oh, right trigger. Okay. Okay. It's good. It's good. Get in here, dude. Get wet. I'm still fine.
[02:33.180 --> 02:37.480]  There's a second one. Can I put the second one in as well? Yeah. Hot hands, huh?
[02:38.580 --> 02:43.700]  Okay. Hot hands. So did that just drop from one of the things? Yeah, it fell from a leech thing.
[02:45.680 --> 02:48.840]  It looked very bulbous. I don't know if it can drop from any of them,
[02:48.840 --> 02:53.540]  but there was one that was like particularly large, and it popped out of that one. Oh, there's a couple, oh boy.
[02:55.360 --> 02:59.080]  Nothing from these. There's another Bulby. I wonder if you shoot him if it does it.
[03:00.220 --> 03:03.040]  Oh, yeah, you got to get the Bulby one. So there's two over here.
[03:03.760 --> 03:05.640]  Can you mock a Bulby one so I can see it?
[03:07.060 --> 03:10.400]  Sure, I need to get in the shower first. Uh-oh, enemies.
[03:12.680 --> 03:13.680]  Oh, nice grenade.
[03:14.900 --> 03:17.920]  Oh, I'm radiating like a mother. Yep.
[03:21.300 --> 03:21.700]  Oh,
[03:21.780 --> 03:24.760]  I need to get some anti-rad juice or something in my super soaker.
[03:24.960 --> 03:25.560]  Rad away.
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.020]  So I just pick this thing up and then run to the cart and then push right trigger on the cart.
[03:32.500 --> 03:35.400]  I'll try to find a Bulby for you Gavin, so you can see
[03:36.240 --> 03:38.920]  what these things look like. Let's get rid of these chairmen.
[03:41.780 --> 03:46.080]  Oh shit, am I gonna get down from this? Can we push the cart forward a little bit?
[03:46.520 --> 03:52.060]  I don't know if we can move it. I kind of wonder if it moves once we have enough. Oh, Geoff's moving it.
[03:52.820 --> 03:56.720]  Oh, you can move it? Hell yeah. Yeah, that's great. That will help our radiation.
[03:58.280 --> 03:59.740]  Oh, we can multiple push it.
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.300]  Are you pushing it or are you pushing me? How do I- are you actually pressing something to push or just running into it?
[04:06.360 --> 04:07.540]  No, I'm just running into it.
[04:08.820 --> 04:10.600]  I felt like I didn't go any faster when I helped.
[04:12.860 --> 04:13.900]  That's the thought that counts.
[04:17.200 --> 04:20.240]  I found a shelter. Do you want me to open that right now, or do we want to wait?
[04:21.560 --> 04:26.760]  Yeah, let's do it. Gavin, there's a Bulby. If you come to me. Oh, I see it. Yeah, that's a Bulboy.
[04:27.040 --> 04:28.180]  Okay, I'm gonna open this shelter.
[04:29.740 --> 04:31.480]  Okay, we got guys spawning in from behind us.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.520]  Let's make them die. Big bastard. Great idea. Postulman.
[04:40.800 --> 04:43.100]  I upgraded my shotgun overnight.
[04:44.000 --> 04:44.680]  Upgrade shit.
[04:46.100 --> 04:46.460]  Okay.
[04:48.940 --> 04:49.820]  Put in my super.
[04:52.880 --> 04:53.900]  Dude, I want a super.
[04:55.340 --> 05:00.340]  I'm sure you'll be able to get one after this. I'll figure out what it is. Oh, I went down.
[05:02.780 --> 05:05.940]  Fuck out of here, Postulman. Where are you down? I'll get you.
[05:09.900 --> 05:13.600]  Slap you on the back a few times. Thank you. A little punch, a little elbow.
[05:14.000 --> 05:14.680]  Got it.
[05:16.160 --> 05:16.960]  Chunking away. Alright, he dead.
[05:18.660 --> 05:26.980]  Cool. I love the design of this game. It's so funny putting a little kettle on top and heating it up to get my fire bullets.
[05:28.700 --> 05:36.500]  Okay, this game has a hell of a personality. Yeah. We should do a video of best gun attachments in video games. That would be fun.
[05:37.940 --> 05:43.960]  Do you ever play Postal 2? No. Yes. You could silence your weapons by putting a cat on the end.
[05:46.060 --> 05:48.400]  That's why you turned out the way you are.
[05:48.560 --> 05:51.640]  Because you played Postal 2 way too young.
[05:52.300 --> 05:58.340]  I was like 15 or so. Some of the stories I've heard about Gavin and Cat suddenly make way more sense.
[05:58.440 --> 06:03.800]  I think there was a silencing attempting. What, would it silence my finger by accident? Oh, fuck. I'm so radiated. I'm so radiated.
[06:05.460 --> 06:10.320]  And all the enemies are... Hey guys, powerful, powerful enemy. Chris O'Connor.
[06:13.580 --> 06:15.740]  The most Boston name of all time.
[06:19.640 --> 06:25.560]  Oh shit, I might go down in the shower. Don't do it, dude. Yeah, you did. Sure did. Thank you, Gavin.
[06:29.570 --> 06:30.150]  Hell yeah.
[06:31.830 --> 06:35.370]  All right, let's kill Chris O'Connor. Yeah, let's get this Chris O'Connor out of the way.
[06:36.790 --> 06:37.930]  I missed all my grenades.
[06:39.730 --> 06:42.370]  Oh, this pump-action shotgun level two is pretty nice.
[06:44.790 --> 06:47.410]  Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.
[06:51.710 --> 06:53.250]  I reacted way too late.
[06:56.670 --> 06:59.470]  Where did it go?
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.600]  How's my radiation going down?
[07:09.860 --> 07:12.460]  Do we still need to... Oh, did we load them in already, I guess?
[07:12.880 --> 07:15.660]  That's why I can't find it. I did not, did you guys?
[07:16.600 --> 07:20.340]  What were you looking for? Gavin, did you put anything in? I put one in just now. Did you put any... Oh, you did, okay.
[07:21.760 --> 07:25.720]  I guess let's keep going. I'm gonna go left. I feel like I'm playing Overwatch.
[07:28.800 --> 07:29.980]  Move in with the payload.
[07:31.300 --> 07:32.540]  You know, that's why I can't...
[07:33.200 --> 07:37.780]  That's why I can't play that Marvel Rivals game. I just don't... I don't like that payload fucking game type.
[07:38.100 --> 07:39.540]  It's bored to death of it.
[07:40.620 --> 07:43.620]  I just suck. That's why I don't play. It's a whole fucking game.
[07:45.180 --> 07:47.660]  Push the car. Stop them from pushing the car.
[07:48.780 --> 07:53.520]  I really enjoyed Overwatch when it came out. Yeah, it was good until it wasn't.
[07:54.320 --> 07:55.400]  How did it get wasn't?
[07:56.240 --> 07:57.460]  I just got sick of it. Oh.
[07:57.960 --> 08:06.080]  Getting sick of it and also like they changed the team sizes and then like they made a weird Overwatch 2 that was just Overwatch 1.
[08:06.740 --> 08:11.900]  Yeah, and I think they've turned things around a little bit from what I understand.
[08:12.040 --> 08:17.200]  They introduced a new mode that people seem to like but it definitely... I know that
[08:17.800 --> 08:23.620]  Marvel Rivals brought Millie back to Overwatch because she thought Marvel Rivals was the worst version of Overwatch.
[08:27.160 --> 08:31.340]  It's not interesting to watch what your kids play especially as adults.
[08:31.540 --> 08:35.280]  She and her boyfriend have been obsessed with the Rocksteady Batman games.
[08:35.880 --> 08:41.840]  Interesting. Every night they're up till like 3 a.m. Playing Batman. I mean they're great games. And then recently they started Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
[08:42.840 --> 08:43.940]  They're super into it.
[08:45.000 --> 08:52.120]  That is like the perfect summer break game. That game is so goddamn big. Yeah, it is like if you...
[08:52.660 --> 08:57.980]  If you want to just sink hundreds of hours into an Assassin's Creed, that's the one.
[09:00.420 --> 09:01.780]  Well now I want to play it.
[09:02.700 --> 09:07.640]  It's fine. I think Revelations is the last Assassin's Creed I beat.
[09:09.120 --> 09:14.720]  That game made me realize that Greece is probably the most smashed country. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.620]  I gotta find these pustules. Where are they?
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.740]  Back here, maybe?
[09:21.200 --> 09:25.600]  That game does a really funny thing, Odyssey, where in the first
[09:25.600 --> 09:31.440]  island that you start at, you encounter a quest where there is like an infection going on.
[09:31.780 --> 09:36.140]  Oh, yeah. In a small community and you have to decide if
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.980]  you want to either execute this whole family that have no symptoms of the disease, but they were in like
[09:43.540 --> 09:49.540]  proximity, I think, of someone who did. Or if you want to let them go and not not kill this family.
[09:49.980 --> 09:56.040]  And I spent so long because there was like a sort of sense that this implication, like this choice will have
[09:56.040 --> 10:00.580]  implications beyond this decision and that like you need to really factor it in.
[10:00.580 --> 10:06.460]  So I spent like 30 minutes really evaluating what I was going to do. Made my choice.
[10:06.940 --> 10:10.940]  It made an impact on that island, which is a place you never need to revisit again.
[10:11.160 --> 10:14.180]  It was not at all meaningful. I wasted so much time
[10:14.680 --> 10:18.880]  trying to weigh this moral dilemma that really had zero
[10:19.360 --> 10:20.340]  concern in the game.
[10:21.700 --> 10:24.360]  It was a weird total shift where it went from that to the next mission
[10:24.360 --> 10:29.440]  I did. A side quest was this old guy wants to fuck his wife, but he can't get his dick up.
[10:29.440 --> 10:33.580]  So you got to make Viagra and it's like the tonal shift was so weird.
[10:35.360 --> 10:37.820]  It's a very strange game. It is.
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.000]  So do we just need to shoot these guys till someone, till they drop?
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.040]  Yeah, I shot one.
[10:42.640 --> 10:47.020]  Okay. I shot one that wasn't postulated and one came out. You got one? Okay.
[10:47.500 --> 10:51.980]  Okay. I've only been looking for the Bulby boys. So I'll start shooting the small guys.
[10:56.300 --> 11:01.360]  I feel like the people that really like pimple popping videos will love this mission.
[11:01.360 --> 11:03.640]  This must be like a weird...
[11:05.260 --> 11:06.200]  Who are those people?
[11:07.940 --> 11:13.660]  You know, I'm not one of those people, but there is a thing of like when I watch Pirates of the Caribbean
[11:14.320 --> 11:19.040]  Who's the guy with the barnacle face? Is that Keith Richards? Is that the character he played?
[11:19.900 --> 11:24.480]  He had like barnacles and shit all over his face. There was part of me that was like, you should just scrape that off.
[11:24.480 --> 11:25.900]  Oh, Johnny Depp.
[11:29.020 --> 11:29.980]  Was it Johnny Depp?
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.800]  No, he is in that movie, but... Which movie? Maybe it was Pirates movies. Which one?
[11:36.500 --> 11:40.260]  The one where there's the guy that has the barnacles all over his face.
[11:41.280 --> 11:44.900]  Is that the second one or third one? Second one is Squid Face, isn't it?
[11:45.860 --> 11:49.700]  Yeah, but there's a... I think Orlando Bloom's dad is played by Keith Richards
[11:49.700 --> 11:55.360]  And he's got a whole bunch of like barnacles and shit on his face, and I was watching that. Oh, here we go. There's one.
[11:56.780 --> 11:57.180]  Pearl.
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.980]  I was like, ah, you should you should remove those. I think it would be satisfying to like clean that up.
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.840]  I find it satisfying to watch like sometimes I'll get a tick-tock of like a turtle shell being cleaned and I get something out of that.
[12:15.020 --> 12:20.700]  But in the way where it's not like, yeah, get them barnacles off. It's for me. It's like, oh, yeah
[12:20.700 --> 12:25.460]  That guy's gonna be so much more comfortable. That turtle's gonna be so much happier. That makes me happy.
[12:25.900 --> 12:27.860]  You're happy for the turtle? Yes.
[12:28.660 --> 12:30.800]  It's not a weird sexual fetish. No!
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.640]  Okay. Although I did get all the achievements in Power Wash Simulator, and I'm super into that game, but I don't know.
[12:37.280 --> 12:40.020]  I don't know how that reads. I don't get that one.
[12:41.020 --> 12:45.980]  Yeah, that is maybe the least you game I could possibly imagine, but I wonder if Geoff would like it.
[12:46.140 --> 12:49.700]  Like, I power wash stuff for real, and it's like, it's all right.
[12:50.680 --> 12:51.720]  I wouldn't do it. Oh, I've spent
[12:52.780 --> 12:53.460]  I've spent
[12:54.380 --> 13:00.700]  Tens of hours just slowly power washing buildings and making sure I get the achievements, and I really enjoyed that.
[13:03.120 --> 13:05.000]  Sounds nice. Oh, I found one. Okay.
[13:07.620 --> 13:08.680]  I gotta run it.
[13:11.280 --> 13:12.700]  All right, this will be the last season.
[13:13.860 --> 13:16.640]  Yeah, I'm gonna, I might not make it.
[13:16.820 --> 13:17.680]  I might not make it, boys.
[13:17.880 --> 13:19.760]  I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. I'm tough. I'm strong.
[13:20.160 --> 13:25.100]  Are you both hurt? Can I, is there anything I can, can I de-radiate you at all with my water now?
[13:25.200 --> 13:28.960]  Yeah, yeah, spray me. Spray me. Yeah, spray me. It's not, that's nice. It's not really working.
[13:29.720 --> 13:31.420]  No, it's not super helpful.
[13:32.540 --> 13:33.660]  All right, I'm gonna go back to the shower then.
[13:34.660 --> 13:36.180]  You wanna take a shower with me? Yeah.
[13:37.220 --> 13:39.280]  Let me charge up a big one and see if that...
[13:40.580 --> 13:43.240]  Oh, we got more people. We got postural boys.
[13:45.900 --> 13:49.020]  Uh, postural. Oh, fuck. Ow.
[13:52.350 --> 13:54.110]  I feel like I'm doing shit to him.
[14:01.320 --> 14:04.860]  Ooh, Gav, rough for you. That was rough.
[14:06.800 --> 14:07.780]  Punch you in the head.
[14:10.180 --> 14:12.920]  Anyway, we're back to touching each other. I mean taking a shower.
[14:16.860 --> 14:21.680]  Okay, we can go to the next zone. I'm gonna push this thing because I just assume we'll need to take it with us.
[14:24.020 --> 14:29.800]  What, are we on three, are we doing three ducks with this, Geoff? What are we doing? I just did normal.
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.140]  Okay, no ducks? I don't know if it turns ducks on or not, to be honest with you, at normal.
[14:35.600 --> 14:39.940]  I don't think we got ducks on because I think the ducks are the object of power things you have to do.
[14:39.940 --> 14:40.120]  Right.
[14:46.240 --> 14:47.040]  Push it.
[14:49.040 --> 14:50.600]  All right, next zone. Here we go.
[14:52.900 --> 14:56.920]  I'm scared of like whatever creature thing we're gonna have to fight using this thing.
[14:58.260 --> 15:05.260]  Load the shuttle with leech pearls. Okay. We go to space? Oh no. Oh, we might be spacing. You okay, Geoff?
[15:05.700 --> 15:08.380]  Yeah, yeah, I just looked up. Oh, chair people from behind.
[15:08.380 --> 15:10.220]  There are a bunch of people helping me push.
[15:11.320 --> 15:18.050]  Get out of here, get out of here.
[15:18.990 --> 15:21.170]  Are they pushing the cart back? Yeah.
[15:21.910 --> 15:24.410]  Or it's just rolling down the hill. One of the two.
[15:25.090 --> 15:26.290]  Um, another chair man.
[15:28.810 --> 15:32.810]  I'm reloading. We got one more chair person behind. Oh shit, I accidentally knocked a pustule out.
[15:33.810 --> 15:34.130]  Nice.
[15:35.230 --> 15:38.590]  Oh, we got 15 more. Jesus Christ. That guy's taking a shower.
[15:41.570 --> 15:44.710]  He's like, I'm radiated. Why you gotta be mean?
[15:46.730 --> 15:50.310]  I'm liking the ziplines though. Yeah, I need some ammo.
[15:54.410 --> 15:58.990]  I'm gonna centralize the... Oh, it's a bat bull.
[16:00.870 --> 16:07.450]  I find it so satisfying when you go on like a 40 button run with those quick time events. It's pretty great.
[16:08.510 --> 16:12.510]  Okay, we got more enemies on the left. I'd say it's more satisfying than, uh,
[16:13.510 --> 16:18.210]  pressure washing. I don't know. Have you ever cleaned a slide? Have you ever cleaned a park?
[16:19.350 --> 16:21.730]  No. Oh, it's pretty good.
[16:23.050 --> 16:25.590]  Do you ever like, what are the dudes that just hang out in the air?
[16:26.470 --> 16:31.170]  Just float way up high. Oh, that's like, uh, just infected people with the hiss.
[16:34.450 --> 16:35.290]  Yeah, that's...
[16:35.290 --> 16:41.210]  You load into control and that's like the first thing you encounter is like everybody in the workspace is just that.
[16:41.910 --> 16:45.430]  And then you have to try to like figure out what's going on. Just like floating against the ceiling.
[16:46.550 --> 16:49.530]  You might accidentally kill a couple before you fully understand what's going on. I think...
[16:50.690 --> 16:52.230]  Oh, I've been killing them left and right.
[16:52.590 --> 16:56.410]  Well, no, I think I did the same thing and I could be wrong about this.
[16:56.470 --> 16:57.290]  I haven't played control in a while,
[16:57.310 --> 17:01.890]  but I think I killed all of them assuming they would become enemies later and then you find out that like, no,
[17:01.930 --> 17:04.650]  you can just reverse what's happened to them. They're completely fine.
[17:05.290 --> 17:07.190]  Oh, I'll stop shooting them all then.
[17:08.110 --> 17:12.990]  I feel bad. It's like, hey, your role playing is Gavin and just imagine they're marines and you're in Halo.
[17:13.390 --> 17:18.630]  That's right. They might have a shotgun. They could. The chain reactions on these postures.
[17:18.890 --> 17:21.850]  Well, you couldn't even get their weapons in Halo 1. You had to shoot them.
[17:23.590 --> 17:27.350]  Yeah. Oh, they just evaporate when you shoot them. That's crazy.
[17:29.730 --> 17:31.630]  Uh, okay, let's find some more.
[17:32.470 --> 17:37.150]  Some more balls, some leech pearls. One of them landed up here if someone can zipline to it.
[17:38.930 --> 17:45.690]  Do you think if leech pearls were like an actual thing, they would be incredibly expensive or viewed as like a shitty pearl?
[17:48.730 --> 17:56.150]  Like would it be extravagant or would it be like dog shit because of the perception leeches have? Maybe it depends on whose blood it sucked.
[17:57.610 --> 18:00.890]  It's like a presidential leaf pearl, leech pearl, I mean.
[18:04.010 --> 18:05.530]  I want a leaf pearl.
[18:07.970 --> 18:11.390]  Oh, that's weird. I never even thought about the idea of like...
[18:12.270 --> 18:18.290]  Can you imagine like opening a pack of trading cards and you get a leech with some celebrity's blood in it as like one of them?
[18:18.330 --> 18:18.610]  Eww.
[18:20.910 --> 18:23.450]  Very Dilibba Thorn-ish. Without regulation.
[18:25.490 --> 18:32.630]  Hahaha, literally zero regulations or policy. That's not a shower. Where's the... okay, shower's over there.
[18:36.070 --> 18:37.290]  God damn, how much ammo can I hold?
[18:37.830 --> 18:42.950]  Christ. Uh, it could also be a thing where you're crafting grenades because you do craft grenades in there as well.
[18:43.450 --> 18:48.050]  It does take longer. You were absolutely shooting me there, by the way. Sure was. Yeah, that happens.
[18:49.110 --> 18:52.510]  Yeah, that happens. Yeah, I've been guilty of that so many times.
[18:52.510 --> 18:56.050]  But uh... Lots of chairman. Finally got caught. Okay, here's another Bulby.
[18:57.170 --> 18:59.890]  Bye-bye, chairman. That was probably like a full board.
[19:01.550 --> 19:03.170]  Really? Not launched.
[19:10.230 --> 19:13.470]  I keep thinking that I can throw these pearls further.
[19:14.890 --> 19:17.190]  All right, I'm gonna start tossing pearls down. Okay.
[19:18.070 --> 19:20.570]  I'm covering from the shower a little bit. Oh, wow.
[19:21.450 --> 19:24.130]  You must be super radiated from that. Yeah.
[19:26.310 --> 19:28.730]  Oh my god, three of them?
[19:29.250 --> 19:29.750]  Holy shit.
[19:30.730 --> 19:30.850]  Okay.
[19:31.850 --> 19:35.670]  Oh, I am not pulling my weight in this pearl department. I'm watching you. What you're doing.
[19:36.630 --> 19:37.570]  I'll put two of them in.
[19:40.110 --> 19:46.670]  All right, I'm getting cooked. Yeah, you should shower up. There might just be too many by the shower.
[19:48.430 --> 19:49.630]  I'm gonna start moving.
[19:50.530 --> 19:53.770]  Not for long. Oh, oh no.
[19:56.050 --> 19:56.530]  Grenade.
[19:58.430 --> 19:58.910]  Pustuleman.
[20:00.270 --> 20:06.150]  They're getting radiated. Is that good or bad? Probably bad for us. I assume. Probably powering up. Yeah.
[20:07.330 --> 20:12.310]  Oh, I hate the pustuleman so much. All right, I'm gonna get some of these balls out of here.
[20:16.710 --> 20:23.350]  Shouldn't have moved the damn car so far. Yeah, you weren't kidding. They are genuinely fucking us up by being too close.
[20:25.430 --> 20:33.510]  That was wild. I think the effect was really stacking there. Yeah. Oh, I need health so bad. Okay. All right, that's the last one.
[20:36.730 --> 20:39.190]  It might be that some...
[20:39.190 --> 20:40.710]  Is that everyone that we need for this section?
[20:41.490 --> 20:45.710]  No, we need four more. It might be the same. And I also feel like we're missing some collectibles.
[20:46.670 --> 20:53.050]  Like some upgrade material on the floor. Oh, I'm sure. So let's like explore. I've done a lot of exploring, but that's a pretty big area.
[20:53.150 --> 20:56.690]  Oh, it's huge. Yeah, probably a lot more to find. Barely scratched the surface on it.
[21:00.370 --> 21:01.370]  Hey, more guys.
[21:03.630 --> 21:05.570]  More guys? I'm looking for less guys.
[21:08.890 --> 21:10.670]  You ever sick of more guys?
[21:11.870 --> 21:18.170]  What is going on here with this? Are you seeing this? Is it just my screen? Uh, I'm seeing it.
[21:18.550 --> 21:22.650]  Uh, I'm down. It's just like a pulsating black. Yeah, get away from that.
[21:23.050 --> 21:29.390]  Just imagine it's like the Tasmanian devil in Looney Tunes. You just want no part of it. I don't know if the game was glitching. No.
[21:33.310 --> 21:36.350]  I thought something that was like some collision that was happening. Okay, I found a shelter.
[21:36.850 --> 21:40.010]  I'm gonna pop this open to get ready for enemies. Chuck and hold out.
[21:42.170 --> 21:44.410]  We got one over here too as soon as we deal with the shelter.
[21:48.120 --> 21:54.000]  Oh, getting so many upgrade materials. This is great. This game's great. Chairman. Uh-oh.
[21:55.860 --> 21:59.900]  This game is great. I need a shower. I need a shower.
[22:01.480 --> 22:05.900]  Am I getting electrocuted? Yeah, I'm getting shocked by something. Uh, probably the grenade I threw.
[22:08.140 --> 22:10.160]  Hey, it happens. That's gonna happen from time to time.
[22:13.100 --> 22:16.040]  Grab some grenades, grab some ammo. Oh, shit.
[22:16.040 --> 22:22.500]  Got a lot of people out here. Holy shit. Oh, yeah. I'm chunking them. Got a big boy.
[22:25.820 --> 22:27.420]  Someone's throwing grenades at me.
[22:30.540 --> 22:35.680]  Okay, we get everything in here. All the upgrades and all. Good deal. Grab a couple grenades.
[22:40.140 --> 22:45.180]  Did you get that pustule, Andrew? No. Sorry. That's okay.
[22:45.180 --> 22:52.200]  You don't have to apologize. Somebody's mad at you. I'm just exploring. I'm looking around. I'm doing a little exploring to see if there's any
[22:53.080 --> 22:55.880]  upgrade shit. I just found some, so I'm happy about that.
[22:57.400 --> 23:02.260]  All right, I'm gonna try and find the last two balls. I've got one right here, Geoff. The last one ball.
[23:02.380 --> 23:04.600]  I got two balls for you right here.
[23:08.600 --> 23:09.980]  Now that you mention it.
[23:11.640 --> 23:14.460]  I hear something big walking around. Oh, shit.
[23:15.740 --> 23:20.880]  I see a bunch of guards spawning. I got the final ball. The final ball?
[23:23.760 --> 23:25.380]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[23:31.320 --> 23:33.780]  Showering up. Everyone got ammo and showering?
[23:34.680 --> 23:38.260]  Yeah, I should get more ammo. That's a good call. I'm pushing the thing, but then I'll
[23:38.920 --> 23:40.080]  take a little break and
[23:40.680 --> 23:41.740]  heal off for some ammo.
[23:43.440 --> 23:46.900]  What's the little blue number next to your names? One and three.
[23:47.960 --> 23:51.140]  That is specific upgrade material found
[23:51.720 --> 23:52.600]  in this level.
[23:53.560 --> 23:58.040]  So I have 22 folders or whatever and three of the blue things. Geoff has four and one.
[23:59.960 --> 24:00.720]  Ain't got nothing.
[24:02.180 --> 24:04.040]  Ain't got a goddamn thing.
[24:05.540 --> 24:07.740]  At least it gets distributed. He ain't found shit.
[24:08.020 --> 24:08.840]  Amongst all of us.
[24:08.840 --> 24:09.720]  Spaceballs?
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.420]  I'm happy that that guy's coming back and that I saw like it was a big deal that he was returning.
[24:18.120 --> 24:19.460]  For spaceballs, too.
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.920]  Found another shelter, so I'm opening it and grabbing more folders.
[24:28.680 --> 24:33.820]  What is the longest gap between sequels made by the same people? Oh, that has to be up there, right?
[24:33.820 --> 24:39.520]  I think it's uh, well, not made by the same people, but I think uh, I think it was Bambi.
[24:39.600 --> 24:40.840]  I think I did that for Soar, right?
[24:42.840 --> 24:44.220]  Bambi and Bambi remade that.
[24:45.020 --> 24:45.780]  60 years.
[24:46.140 --> 24:47.940]  But like not comparable to spaceballs.
[24:48.700 --> 24:50.300]  Yeah, spaceballs a long time.
[24:51.160 --> 24:51.860]  Oh, Geoff behind you.
[25:04.630 --> 25:05.170]  All right.
[25:05.670 --> 25:07.530]  Get this fire out.
[25:11.010 --> 25:11.410]  Ammo?
[25:12.010 --> 25:13.970]  As soon as we clear these people, I'm on fire.
[25:13.970 --> 25:15.630]  I got it.
[25:21.620 --> 25:23.600]  Oh, I'm almost dead. Chill.
[25:25.080 --> 25:26.480]  You guys gotta relax.
[25:28.400 --> 25:28.840]  Jesus.
[25:30.080 --> 25:32.000]  They just keep spawning, it feels like.
[25:33.520 --> 25:36.320]  And I'm clearing the fire and then I'm gonna hop in the shower for a minute.
[25:36.980 --> 25:37.140]  Okay.
[25:38.660 --> 25:39.540]  Pushing the cot.
[25:45.520 --> 25:46.400]  Good push.
[25:47.400 --> 25:49.080]  God, I feel bad about killing all those people.
[25:51.240 --> 25:57.620]  I'm running around and exploring while I can because I feel like as soon as that gets pushed in, everything is going to go to shit.
[25:58.480 --> 25:59.680]  Initiate shuttle fueling.
[25:59.820 --> 26:00.560]  That sounds bad.
[26:05.060 --> 26:05.380]  Okay.
[26:06.080 --> 26:07.920]  How am I already out of ammo? Oh my god.
[26:09.420 --> 26:11.480]  Do we have a ammo station on this?
[26:11.640 --> 26:11.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:12.220 --> 26:13.040]  Back by the, it's back here.
[26:13.940 --> 26:15.040]  Oh, right through the door.
[26:16.220 --> 26:17.520]  No, it's not even through the door, it's just back here.
[26:18.940 --> 26:19.380]  Fuel?
[26:22.400 --> 26:23.560]  Here's the fuel thing.
[26:30.140 --> 26:31.500]  We got a lot of people out here.
[26:39.040 --> 26:41.040]  Let me know when you guys want me to initiate fuel.
[26:42.700 --> 26:44.280]  I'm gonna manually put some fire out.
[26:45.100 --> 26:45.660]  Yeah, me too.
[26:48.900 --> 26:49.860]  Okay, good job.
[26:50.000 --> 26:50.180]  Alright.
[26:54.970 --> 26:56.250]  Got another folder.
[26:58.130 --> 26:58.970]  Check you out.
[26:59.910 --> 27:00.550]  I know.
[27:02.950 --> 27:05.390]  I'm so excited to upgrade.
[27:05.730 --> 27:06.170]  Hey Gav, come here for a second.
[27:09.090 --> 27:10.430]  Hold on, let's kill these guys.
[27:10.850 --> 27:11.970]  Okay, I'm gonna pop open a shelter.
[27:12.490 --> 27:13.410]  I wanna see your face real fast.
[27:14.370 --> 27:15.470]  How much damage did that do?
[27:15.690 --> 27:16.110]  Quite a lot.
[27:20.090 --> 27:20.710]  Why'd you do that?
[27:20.750 --> 27:21.730]  So I can pop open the shower.
[27:28.970 --> 27:30.590]  Oh, were we? I didn't even think about it.
[27:31.050 --> 27:31.710]  Oh shit.
[27:32.010 --> 27:32.710]  I think it did a lot.
[27:33.830 --> 27:34.610]  Seems like it did.
[27:36.410 --> 27:38.350]  The beach ball seems to have... oh shit.
[27:39.750 --> 27:40.730]  You got beach ball problems?
[27:41.050 --> 27:42.950]  Well, it's bad by the shower. There's a postulant.
[27:48.220 --> 27:48.940]  Big boy.
[27:50.980 --> 27:52.380]  We're working on a heavy over here.
[27:53.520 --> 27:54.360]  Not anymore we're not.
[27:55.460 --> 27:55.820]  He's dead.
[27:57.560 --> 27:58.960]  He's not heavy, he's dead.
[27:58.960 --> 27:59.680]  Oh shit.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.500]  I hear a heavy behind me.
[28:08.020 --> 28:10.440]  I feel like we've...
[28:10.440 --> 28:11.960]  explored things pretty thoroughly.
[28:12.400 --> 28:13.600]  Son of a bitch.
[28:14.180 --> 28:15.500]  Son of a bitch!
[28:15.620 --> 28:16.220]  More postulant.
[28:19.060 --> 28:20.740]  Cheer dudes and pussies.
[28:21.360 --> 28:21.920]  I got him here.
[28:22.740 --> 28:23.300]  Pussy.
[28:23.940 --> 28:25.920]  Yeah, I regretted it as soon as I said it.
[28:28.340 --> 28:29.400]  Instant regret.
[28:29.400 --> 28:31.360]  That's the best kind.
[28:31.880 --> 28:32.840]  Oh, fire.
[28:35.840 --> 28:37.820]  Nice. Good kill.
[28:38.240 --> 28:40.160]  Got more cheer dudes.
[28:41.900 --> 28:45.200]  Oh, I just got a message saying...
[28:45.200 --> 28:46.700]  Geoff's birthday present is arriving.
[28:47.340 --> 28:49.340]  Oh, that's exciting.
[28:50.100 --> 28:51.400]  Gavin will be 11 months early.
[28:53.360 --> 28:55.420]  Yeah, happy 51st.
[28:55.820 --> 28:56.780]  Thanks man.
[28:57.340 --> 28:58.740]  Before anyone else gets in there.
[28:59.440 --> 29:00.540]  You didn't have to give me anything.
[29:02.400 --> 29:05.220]  I don't think I've ever got you anything in the 20 years I've known you.
[29:05.260 --> 29:06.620]  So it just felt like the one.
[29:07.600 --> 29:09.160]  Honestly, that's kind of the way I like it.
[29:09.940 --> 29:11.460]  I'll do you one every 20 years.
[29:12.120 --> 29:12.420]  Okay.
[29:12.900 --> 29:13.140]  Deal.
[29:14.400 --> 29:15.640]  I'll do you one every 17.
[29:16.020 --> 29:20.860]  I feel left out of this equation.
[29:21.920 --> 29:22.640]  It's fucked up.
[29:26.820 --> 29:27.400]  Okay.
[29:28.060 --> 29:29.640]  We gotta defend it, I guess.
[29:29.720 --> 29:31.700]  I don't know where they're attacking it from.
[29:34.140 --> 29:35.780]  I don't even see any enemies.
[29:38.500 --> 29:40.240]  I forget he's dead.
[29:40.840 --> 29:41.520]  And I get sad.
[29:42.120 --> 29:43.600]  It is really fucking sad.
[29:46.280 --> 29:47.180]  He does not...
[29:47.180 --> 29:49.860]  He seems far too young to be dead.
[29:50.400 --> 29:50.580]  Yeah.
[29:51.480 --> 29:53.040]  So many great characters.
[29:53.040 --> 29:53.920]  Yeah.
[29:55.480 --> 29:56.800]  True Blood... or not True Blood.
[29:57.040 --> 29:57.820]  Near Dark.
[29:58.420 --> 30:00.960]  Does not get the love it deserves.
[30:01.100 --> 30:02.220]  He's so good in that movie.
[30:03.960 --> 30:04.940]  What about True Life?
[30:05.740 --> 30:07.920]  True Life is fucking fantastic in.
[30:07.980 --> 30:11.100]  He does not mind looking like a little schmuck.
[30:11.220 --> 30:12.800]  He looks like a turd in that movie.
[30:13.060 --> 30:13.700]  It is great.
[30:14.700 --> 30:16.300]  Have you seen Near Dark, Gavin?
[30:16.920 --> 30:17.380]  No.
[30:17.980 --> 30:21.060]  He plays a badass vampire in it and he's fucking awesome.
[30:21.440 --> 30:22.160]  He's so cool.
[30:22.300 --> 30:23.340]  I found a room to open.
[30:23.640 --> 30:25.620]  I turned on a turret.
[30:27.640 --> 30:28.440]  Oh, a guitar.
[30:30.240 --> 30:31.920]  First time I've seen one of those in the game.
[30:40.610 --> 30:41.230]  Pustuleman, Andrew.
[30:42.210 --> 30:42.510]  Where?
[30:43.610 --> 30:44.850]  Oh, he was coming for you this way.
[30:44.930 --> 30:45.270]  Oh, okay.
[30:45.450 --> 30:48.870]  I just happened to start running the other way when you said that.
[30:49.010 --> 30:49.410]  I was like, ah!
[30:50.490 --> 30:50.850]  Where?
[30:56.900 --> 30:57.620]  Oh, what's...
[30:57.620 --> 30:57.900]  Come on.
[30:58.920 --> 31:00.340]  Chair people suck.
[31:02.480 --> 31:05.740]  If this was a Kojima game, the chair people would be like Herman Miller.
[31:05.960 --> 31:08.580]  So it would be a blatant advertisement of some chair company.
[31:11.220 --> 31:13.040]  Uh-oh, it's a squad of lazy boys.
[31:16.200 --> 31:19.280]  Oh, a lazy boy would be, I think, the all-time floating chair.
[31:19.620 --> 31:20.660]  That would be so cozy.
[31:22.960 --> 31:24.060]  Can you imagine that?
[31:24.060 --> 31:27.800]  That might be the most comfortable a person can be.
[31:27.980 --> 31:29.800]  Can you imagine a hairless and a lazy boy?
[31:30.340 --> 31:32.520]  Oh, we should do a zero-G lazy boy.
[31:34.420 --> 31:37.680]  I wonder if a person can become so comfortable they die.
[31:39.200 --> 31:42.320]  I became so comfortable I fell asleep in a Mission Impossible movie.
[31:44.640 --> 31:45.460]  I pick.
[31:46.360 --> 31:47.760]  Is that the new one? Did you get the new one?
[31:47.940 --> 31:48.920]  No, it was...
[31:48.920 --> 31:50.480]  What was the one before Fallout?
[31:51.060 --> 31:52.180]  I don't know.
[31:52.200 --> 31:53.680]  They all run together to me.
[31:54.120 --> 31:54.760]  Call the elevator.
[31:55.640 --> 31:59.140]  I was reading today that Tom Cruise was almost in the
[31:59.140 --> 32:01.220]  Zack Snyder's Watchmen movie.
[32:01.800 --> 32:04.060]  And that he wanted to cast him as Ozymandias.
[32:04.220 --> 32:05.860]  And I think that would have been fucking cool.
[32:06.320 --> 32:08.400]  I feel like that's the perfect Tom Cruise role.
[32:10.140 --> 32:13.640]  He wanted to play Rorschach, which I couldn't imagine at all.
[32:13.720 --> 32:14.780]  That would be so bad.
[32:15.220 --> 32:17.020]  But then you know he would be fucking awesome at it.
[32:17.020 --> 32:18.440]  Oh, he'd be really cool.
[32:18.560 --> 32:20.860]  But I feel like he's just like...
[32:20.860 --> 32:22.520]  He's too pretty to be Rorschach.
[32:24.220 --> 32:26.100]  I can see every other angle of it.
[32:26.180 --> 32:29.000]  But there's like sort of a ugliness to Rorschach.
[32:29.240 --> 32:31.400]  That I feel like is sort of important to who he is.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.880]  I feel like the guy that played Ozymandias though is still really memorable.
[32:35.580 --> 32:36.180]  Oh, absolutely.
[32:36.520 --> 32:38.340]  And it's funny because like...
[32:38.340 --> 32:41.280]  The thing I read about it was an interview with him talking about it.
[32:41.340 --> 32:43.500]  And feeling like he didn't do a good enough job in that role.
[32:43.900 --> 32:45.300]  And that it should have went to somebody else.
[32:45.300 --> 32:48.000]  But like he felt that his performance was lacking.
[32:48.280 --> 32:50.360]  He had the perfect level of smugness and power.
[32:50.800 --> 32:51.240]  Absolutely.
[32:53.620 --> 32:56.700]  You just so rarely get Tom Cruise as a villain.
[32:57.020 --> 32:59.780]  That I always really enjoy when it happens.
[33:00.180 --> 33:02.060]  What if Tom Cruise played Nixon in that movie?
[33:05.880 --> 33:08.840]  He plays the butterfly guy that goes insane.
[33:09.240 --> 33:12.740]  Just one scene and it's just him screaming and getting like hauled away.
[33:15.300 --> 33:17.620]  So I learned yesterday and I don't know if this is true or not.
[33:17.660 --> 33:18.580]  But I felt like it was.
[33:18.900 --> 33:21.280]  That you can hit the elevator button over and over again.
[33:21.380 --> 33:23.160]  And I feel like it goes faster if you mash it.
[33:24.060 --> 33:24.160]  Really?
[33:24.420 --> 33:24.740]  Really.
[33:26.240 --> 33:28.800]  That's how it felt yesterday when I played a game solo.
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.820]  But I don't know if that was just an illusion.
[33:33.900 --> 33:34.800]  I don't think it is.
[33:34.840 --> 33:35.780]  I think it does go faster.
[33:37.680 --> 33:40.260]  It really taps into that when you're at a crosswalk.
[33:40.320 --> 33:42.060]  And you hit the button 50 times.
[33:42.640 --> 33:44.560]  I'm trying to get it to flip.
[33:46.100 --> 33:47.060]  Oh, it's flying.
[33:48.780 --> 33:49.600]  We're good to go.
[33:51.060 --> 33:52.340]  That is pretty fast.
[33:54.340 --> 33:55.200]  Should we leave Gav?
[33:55.780 --> 33:58.040]  He loves to do this. This is his bit.
[34:04.450 --> 34:04.870]  Yeah!
[34:06.430 --> 34:07.210]  Hell yeah!
[34:08.490 --> 34:09.910]  Man, we're really good at this game.
[34:10.750 --> 34:11.610]  We might be the best.
[34:13.850 --> 34:15.810]  One of my favorite bits of yours.
[34:18.850 --> 34:20.450]  It only gets funnier.
[34:21.590 --> 34:23.430]  I'm going to upgrade sprint.
[34:23.910 --> 34:25.310]  There's so much research.
[34:27.910 --> 34:30.010]  Oh yeah, here's crew.
[34:32.610 --> 34:33.070]  No!
[34:34.430 --> 34:35.270]  Why are we starting?
[34:36.090 --> 34:37.170]  Let's not do that.
[34:37.990 --> 34:40.210]  Guys, be careful.
[34:41.610 --> 34:44.110]  Is the page 2 shotgun a better shotgun?
[34:44.250 --> 34:44.750]  The pump action?
[34:45.370 --> 34:46.970]  I'm not sure how that works.
[34:47.410 --> 34:49.490]  But if you go to page 2 on essentials
[34:49.490 --> 34:50.430]  and requisitions.
[34:51.310 --> 34:53.570]  That line that is a piggy bank,
[34:53.670 --> 34:55.150]  a rocket, and a teapot.
[34:55.250 --> 34:56.610]  That is where I got my super.
[34:58.990 --> 35:01.610]  Do I put it on the gun or in my perk?
[35:04.590 --> 35:05.930]  Click splash kit.
[35:07.570 --> 35:09.130]  Or whatever yours says.
[35:09.130 --> 35:10.670]  It's in crisis kit.
[35:11.330 --> 35:12.910]  And then highlight your thing
[35:12.910 --> 35:13.830]  and see if there is
[35:14.950 --> 35:16.870]  an augment attached to it already.
[35:17.110 --> 35:17.890]  There is, you're good to go.
[35:18.450 --> 35:19.410]  What are you guys talking about?
[35:19.410 --> 35:20.110]  I wasn't even listening.
[35:22.610 --> 35:23.650]  What are you guys doing?
[35:24.150 --> 35:24.910]  That's complicated.
[35:26.110 --> 35:27.250]  I was getting him his super.
[35:28.070 --> 35:28.850]  Oh, I want a super.
[35:29.610 --> 35:32.570]  Go to requisitions.
[35:33.690 --> 35:34.090]  Essentials.
[35:34.250 --> 35:35.150]  Oh, it's on there I think.
[35:35.150 --> 35:36.870]  I don't know why I was trying to put on my shotgun.
[35:37.950 --> 35:38.670]  Requisitions, essentials.
[35:39.070 --> 35:41.090]  Page 2 and then grab the
[35:41.090 --> 35:43.290]  kind of rocket, the garden gnome looking thing.
[35:43.510 --> 35:44.870]  I guess it's just called a garden gnome.
[35:47.610 --> 35:49.090]  And then if you select that
[35:49.090 --> 35:49.950]  then you can unlock
[35:51.230 --> 35:52.070]  a super for you.
[35:52.730 --> 35:54.910]  Oh, I see. I don't have enough money, but got it.
[35:55.110 --> 35:56.830]  I'm going to do a shot grenade. That looks fun.
[35:57.650 --> 35:57.850]  Okay.
[35:59.270 --> 36:00.630]  Let me make sure I have everything I want.
[36:00.830 --> 36:02.410]  Level 2 grenade, level 2 gun.
[36:02.410 --> 36:03.870]  Added those.
[36:04.630 --> 36:06.470]  Select job. Are we going to go for
[36:06.470 --> 36:08.410]  frequency shift or are we going to do...
[36:09.430 --> 36:10.470]  Whatever the next job is.
[36:10.790 --> 36:12.430]  Okay, yeah. Frequency shift,
[36:12.550 --> 36:13.650]  level 3, normal.
[36:14.950 --> 36:16.230]  Won't let me do ducks
[36:16.230 --> 36:18.410]  unless I
[36:19.670 --> 36:20.190]  add...
[36:20.190 --> 36:21.670]  Wait, I don't understand.
[36:26.780 --> 36:28.460]  It just says that it has the ducks
[36:30.000 --> 36:30.520]  like...
[36:30.520 --> 36:31.680]  It says 3 ducks.
[36:31.680 --> 36:33.240]  Okay. But they're grey.
[36:34.240 --> 36:35.280]  Have you turned on duck dicks?
[36:37.220 --> 36:37.940]  We'll ready up
[36:37.940 --> 36:38.800]  and we'll just see what happens.
[36:39.940 --> 36:40.300]  Okay.
[36:43.870 --> 36:45.010]  Am I doing something stupid?
[36:45.570 --> 36:47.050]  Probably and the audience is going to be like
[36:47.050 --> 36:48.830]  look at the fucking idiot that was right in front of them
[36:48.830 --> 36:50.890]  on the screen. I'm looking at the screen.
[36:52.110 --> 36:53.270]  I like what we got here.
[36:53.350 --> 36:54.290]  11, 12, 13.
[36:56.090 --> 36:56.990]  Perfect levels. Yeah.
[36:57.910 --> 36:59.730]  Climbing in a very satisfying way.
[37:00.590 --> 37:01.450]  If we were brothers
[37:01.450 --> 37:03.810]  it would mean our parents had sex exactly once a year.
[37:10.970 --> 37:12.630]  Great free throw percentage.
[37:13.330 --> 37:15.290]  Never miss. Every time I'm at the line.
[37:17.710 --> 37:18.270]  Okay.
[37:19.490 --> 37:20.970]  Fix the gamma emitter.
[37:22.170 --> 37:23.450]  I really hope by fixing it
[37:23.450 --> 37:24.810]  it adds chromatic aberration.
[37:25.550 --> 37:26.350]  Oh, that'd be awful.
[37:28.510 --> 37:29.510]  Yes, please.
[37:29.510 --> 37:31.030]  What is this shit?
[37:31.090 --> 37:32.350]  You've seen this red stuff?
[37:34.030 --> 37:34.250]  Yeah.
[37:34.470 --> 37:35.530]  What is this?
[37:35.930 --> 37:39.070]  I can shoot it.
[37:41.530 --> 37:43.990]  I can't. The water doesn't really do anything to it.
[37:45.270 --> 37:46.510]  Oh, it's covering up a lot of shit.
[37:46.670 --> 37:47.550]  Oh, careful. You're pink.
[37:48.630 --> 37:50.490]  I'll explode if I take melee damage.
[37:50.950 --> 37:51.390]  Holy shit.
[37:51.930 --> 37:53.810]  Thank you.
[37:55.710 --> 37:56.430]  Oh, shit.
[37:56.430 --> 37:56.930]  People.
[38:03.430 --> 38:05.150]  Alright, so careful when you're pink
[38:05.150 --> 38:06.550]  because you become explosive.
[38:07.210 --> 38:07.690]  Okay.
[38:12.020 --> 38:13.280]  I'm doing repairs.
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.160]  Does that mean we can make the enemies pink
[38:19.160 --> 38:19.860]  and blow them up?
[38:20.560 --> 38:21.820]  I guess theoretically.
[38:22.180 --> 38:23.060]  That'd be cool.
[38:24.480 --> 38:26.520]  This whole room just exploded.
[38:27.540 --> 38:28.780]  I'm de-pinking the generator.
[38:30.280 --> 38:30.940]  Good.
[38:40.420 --> 38:42.600]  I'm de-pinking this office to see if there are any folders.
[38:44.900 --> 38:46.720]  The emitter won't run until you...
[38:46.720 --> 38:47.600]  What is this?
[38:48.720 --> 38:49.980]  Does the pink repink?
[38:50.180 --> 38:50.780]  I think it might.
[38:51.440 --> 38:52.980]  Does it? That sucks.
[38:57.720 --> 38:58.980]  How do you de-pink stuff?
[38:59.220 --> 38:59.580]  Shoot it.
[39:03.480 --> 39:04.100]  I see.
[39:04.480 --> 39:06.240]  It seems to be like little raspberry pinks.
[39:06.240 --> 39:06.940]  What can you do with those?
[39:07.980 --> 39:08.380]  Shoot them.
[39:09.040 --> 39:09.520]  Oh!
[39:11.140 --> 39:12.040]  Oh, shit.
[39:13.940 --> 39:15.240]  Just repaired a thing.
[39:16.300 --> 39:18.280]  Yeah, did a couple repair things.
[39:18.980 --> 39:20.240]  Oh, you guys doing wrench shit?
[39:20.860 --> 39:21.140]  Yeah.
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.960]  Let me know, I've got the wrench.
[39:26.060 --> 39:27.500]  Where do I take this?
[39:27.640 --> 39:28.900]  Fix power cables?
[39:29.380 --> 39:30.100]  How do I get up there?
[39:31.240 --> 39:33.780]  What is going on with me?
[39:34.120 --> 39:36.700]  I almost died from something.
[39:37.660 --> 39:39.760]  Some dude just swung at me.
[39:40.100 --> 39:41.380]  I didn't know who he was.
[39:41.560 --> 39:41.860]  Pink man!
[39:42.840 --> 39:44.140]  What do we do with these things?
[39:44.200 --> 39:44.760]  Do you see this, Andrew?
[39:45.900 --> 39:47.500]  No, I don't. I'm repairing something.
[39:48.080 --> 39:48.820]  I threw it at you.
[39:49.580 --> 39:51.580]  I have a solar panel near my foot.
[39:51.940 --> 39:53.200]  That's what I'm talking about.
[39:53.360 --> 39:54.320]  I've got three of them.
[39:56.920 --> 39:58.420]  Find and attach emitter plates.
[39:58.540 --> 39:59.000]  There we go.
[39:59.720 --> 40:00.680]  That's what that is.
[40:02.780 --> 40:04.320]  We put them on...
[40:04.320 --> 40:05.100]  Oh, fuck.
[40:10.440 --> 40:11.760]  Oh, you drove.
[40:11.880 --> 40:12.540]  Just like Bumpers.
[40:12.820 --> 40:13.340]  Perfect.
[40:15.900 --> 40:17.780]  Another plate over here.
[40:18.300 --> 40:19.740]  You got them, Jagguy.
[40:20.460 --> 40:21.500]  Another plate.
[40:22.860 --> 40:23.440]  I'm going to open...
[40:24.320 --> 40:25.440]  I found a shelter.
[40:25.600 --> 40:26.360]  I'm cracking it open.
[40:29.460 --> 40:31.200]  I'm going to come there and get some food.
[40:32.220 --> 40:33.400]  Water. Food water.
[40:33.660 --> 40:34.140]  Food water.
[40:39.820 --> 40:40.220]  Guitar.
[40:42.560 --> 40:45.060]  I was hoping it would play a note or something if you shot it.
[40:46.360 --> 40:47.640]  Oh, look at all these repairs.
[40:52.580 --> 40:53.900]  Am I doing anything?
[41:01.390 --> 41:02.190]  There you go, Gavin.
[41:02.790 --> 41:04.150]  Am I doing something?
[41:04.270 --> 41:05.490]  Then the whole object completes.
[41:08.210 --> 41:10.370]  Let's explore here for a little bit before moving on.
[41:10.650 --> 41:12.350]  Just to make sure that we're getting all our shit.
[41:16.330 --> 41:17.110]  Bad room.
[41:18.530 --> 41:19.490]  Piggy bank.
[41:20.710 --> 41:21.290]  Ow.
[41:23.050 --> 41:23.870]  Get away.
[41:24.030 --> 41:25.470]  Tornado of coins.
[41:25.770 --> 41:26.090]  There's some stairs.
[41:28.150 --> 41:29.150]  Tornado coins?
[41:29.970 --> 41:32.290]  My piggy bank made a tornado of shrapnel coins.
[41:32.770 --> 41:33.550]  That's awesome.
[41:34.730 --> 41:36.790]  It sounded like you were playing Mario Party for a second.
[41:37.390 --> 41:39.170]  Tornadoes, coins are flying around.
[41:41.870 --> 41:42.910]  Yeah, that was cool.
[41:42.910 --> 41:43.930]  So that's where we progress.
[41:46.930 --> 41:52.650]  Feels weird walking into these offices and not slingshotting everything into the opposite wall with my mind.
[41:52.950 --> 41:53.170]  Yeah.
[41:55.670 --> 41:57.430]  I'll assume that's a control move.
[41:57.870 --> 41:58.550]  Sure is.
[42:00.830 --> 42:02.730]  Okay, I think...
[42:02.730 --> 42:03.370]  I think it's clear.
[42:03.630 --> 42:05.690]  I think we're pretty clear from what I can tell.
[42:07.550 --> 42:08.330]  Doors opening.
[42:09.210 --> 42:09.470]  Alright.
[42:10.230 --> 42:11.230]  Yeah, I think you're right Gavin.
[42:11.330 --> 42:13.330]  I think these things definitely grow back.
[42:14.910 --> 42:15.230]  Oh.
[42:23.620 --> 42:24.480]  Weird. Okay.
[42:25.600 --> 42:26.420]  I'm gonna take this with me.
[42:26.500 --> 42:28.720]  I found a solar panel that we didn't use.
[42:29.260 --> 42:29.860]  Yeah, I found one too.
[42:30.020 --> 42:31.800]  Oh, there's two of them. So three.
[42:32.800 --> 42:36.320]  I wonder if we'll have to backtrack for these or if it's just they give you more than you need.
[42:37.240 --> 42:38.540]  Doesn't seem like something they would do.
[42:38.800 --> 42:39.560]  It doesn't.
[42:41.540 --> 42:41.930]  Alright.
[42:53.410 --> 42:54.190]  Folder.
[42:55.390 --> 42:56.290]  Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[42:57.390 --> 42:57.790]  Nice.
[43:04.070 --> 43:04.430]  Okay.
[43:09.060 --> 43:09.840]  Jeez.
[43:10.380 --> 43:12.000]  We gotta go through the Pepto wall.
[43:12.000 --> 43:12.040]  Pepto wall.
[43:17.760 --> 43:19.280]  Osmosis Jones looking shit.
[43:21.740 --> 43:24.740]  Oh, there's sinks in here if you want a bit of health.
[43:25.600 --> 43:26.580]  Yeah, thank you.
[43:29.760 --> 43:32.100]  Yeah, they grow back real fast in Pepto Hall.
[43:40.910 --> 43:42.550]  Okay, grabbing another thing.
[43:42.830 --> 43:43.750]  Oh shit, okay.
[43:43.750 --> 43:43.810]  Okay.
[43:45.510 --> 43:46.950]  Clearing Pepto Hall again.
[43:47.850 --> 43:48.610]  I'mma open a door.
[43:56.200 --> 43:57.940]  We got a bunch of dudes spawning in.
[43:58.260 --> 43:59.320]  What's the pink called?
[44:02.140 --> 44:03.640]  Like the actual name of it?
[44:03.800 --> 44:04.040]  Yeah.
[44:04.460 --> 44:05.320]  I have no idea.
[44:05.920 --> 44:07.180]  I'm gonna call it the scrumpf.
[44:08.000 --> 44:08.920]  The scrumpf?
[44:08.980 --> 44:10.220]  I like the scrumpf.
[44:10.480 --> 44:10.780]  Okay.
[44:10.780 --> 44:10.820]  Okay.
[44:15.100 --> 44:15.460]  Uh.
[44:17.640 --> 44:18.860]  There's a pink pustuleman,
[44:18.960 --> 44:20.260]  but I washed him with a sprinkler.
[44:23.800 --> 44:24.160]  Ow!
[44:27.830 --> 44:29.410]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[44:30.190 --> 44:32.010]  Oh, I'm in trouble. I'm in so much trouble. I'm down.
[44:34.570 --> 44:35.670]  Oh, I went down in the shower.
[44:38.390 --> 44:39.770]  I didn't know that we did a shelter.
[44:39.770 --> 44:42.050]  I called it out.
[44:42.390 --> 44:43.290]  I missed it.
[44:43.450 --> 44:44.370]  I missed it too.
[44:46.990 --> 44:47.630]  Oh, Geoff.
[44:54.310 --> 44:55.870]  Alright, Andrew, I'll come to you in just a second.
[44:55.950 --> 44:57.050]  Let me just get this heavy down.
[44:59.130 --> 44:59.890]  Andrew, you're up there.
[45:00.590 --> 45:02.050]  Yeah, I'm right next to a shower.
[45:03.610 --> 45:04.650]  How did you get up there?
[45:05.630 --> 45:06.270]  Uh, stairs.
[45:06.330 --> 45:07.210]  There's some stairs right here.
[45:07.290 --> 45:08.790]  I just gotta blast my way through them.
[45:13.300 --> 45:13.940]  Thank you.
[45:14.460 --> 45:16.180]  To be fair, when I said I was opening a shelter,
[45:16.340 --> 45:18.100]  I just said, I'm opening up a door down here.
[45:20.560 --> 45:21.520]  Needs to be repaired.
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.040]  I'm gonna repair this, uh,
[45:27.060 --> 45:28.320]  ammo thing over here.
[45:28.680 --> 45:29.080]  Okay.
[45:29.400 --> 45:30.580]  Got the shower on.
[45:31.720 --> 45:32.760]  I'm de-pinkin' a Jenny.
[45:34.180 --> 45:34.580]  Sweet.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.940]  Uh, here's where we gotta put the...
[45:42.540 --> 45:43.640]  uh, solar panels.
[45:45.120 --> 45:47.900]  I'm gettin' some turbines spinnin'.
[45:53.700 --> 45:54.840]  If you wanna come to me, Gavin,
[45:54.900 --> 45:56.160]  there's a bunch of shit you can repair.
[45:56.380 --> 45:56.800]  Oh, hell yeah.
[45:58.480 --> 45:59.360]  Hot, hot, hot.
[46:00.020 --> 46:01.600]  Oh, is it all the panels? Yeah, I'll do this.
[46:05.760 --> 46:06.660]  Turbines are spinnin'.
[46:08.580 --> 46:10.000]  Takin' out water, er, fire.
[46:10.520 --> 46:10.880]  With my water.
[46:12.940 --> 46:13.260]  Okay.
[46:16.040 --> 46:16.680]  Lookin' good.
[46:16.680 --> 46:17.280]  That done.
[46:20.280 --> 46:21.640]  I gotta go do this.
[46:23.080 --> 46:24.420]  Oops. Repair job up there.
[46:24.560 --> 46:25.200]  He's on it.
[46:29.450 --> 46:30.910]  Oh, it's so scary when you're
[46:30.910 --> 46:32.930]  in a repair and you can just hear them
[46:33.450 --> 46:34.850]  spawning all around you. Yeah.
[46:37.230 --> 46:38.450]  Hey, good job on that.
[46:40.370 --> 46:44.830]  Oh, you want me to do that? You got it, Geoff.
[46:45.350 --> 46:46.390]  I got it. Okay.
[46:50.570 --> 46:51.190]  Back here.
[46:56.620 --> 46:58.680]  Next zone. Nice.
[46:58.940 --> 47:01.120]  I need to get some ammo before we do that.
[47:03.420 --> 47:04.800]  Great. Everything's
[47:04.800 --> 47:06.620]  exploding. Jesus Christ.
[47:09.520 --> 47:12.780]  Oh, that's so much faster to get ammo now.
[47:12.860 --> 47:14.500]  That's awesome. I'm glad I upgraded that.
[47:15.860 --> 47:16.900]  I go from, like,
[47:17.020 --> 47:18.950]  empty to full in two or three handfuls.
[47:20.440 --> 47:21.060]  Wow, that's great.
[47:22.960 --> 47:24.960]  I'm hoping there's an ammo station through this
[47:24.960 --> 47:26.100]  early part.
[47:26.380 --> 47:27.920]  There was a lot of faff in this.
[47:28.420 --> 47:30.120]  Scruggs? Scrumpf?
[47:31.200 --> 47:32.900]  Scrumpf? A lot of scrumpf.
[47:35.980 --> 47:36.940]  Holy shit!
[47:37.160 --> 47:37.760]  That scrumpf.
[47:39.080 --> 47:39.640]  Scrumpftown.
[47:44.580 --> 47:47.220]  Forget about it, Marge. It's scrumpftown.
[47:48.780 --> 47:49.760]  I'm quoting
[47:50.500 --> 47:52.120]  Homer Simpson, quoting Chinatown.
[47:53.440 --> 47:54.980]  I always wanted to see Chinatown.
[47:55.360 --> 47:57.220]  Oh my god, dude. It's a phenomenal film.
[47:58.280 --> 47:58.920]  Phenomenal film.
[47:59.340 --> 48:01.540]  I overused the word phenomenal, but it is a really good film.
[48:02.600 --> 48:03.500]  It's not the film's fault.
[48:03.580 --> 48:04.580]  I used the word phenomenal too much.
[48:06.520 --> 48:07.520]  Dude, this place
[48:07.520 --> 48:08.240]  sucks.
[48:10.260 --> 48:11.340]  I'm opening this shelter.
[48:11.640 --> 48:13.740]  I want us to have a spawn point if we need it.
[48:13.780 --> 48:14.620]  It feels bad in here.
[48:15.560 --> 48:16.480]  I need ammo, too.
[48:17.520 --> 48:18.600]  Bunch of ammo in this shelter
[48:18.600 --> 48:19.380]  if you can get to me.
[48:20.460 --> 48:22.560]  I just don't know how you even managed to clear that without ammo.
[48:24.960 --> 48:26.380]  I had to hunt, because I went back.
[48:29.880 --> 48:31.200]  Yeah, I just mean, like, what's the alternative?
[48:31.360 --> 48:32.620]  Oh yeah, if you didn't, yeah.
[48:34.800 --> 48:35.900]  Gotta live in the pep town.
[48:36.260 --> 48:37.320]  Gotta live in the scrumpf.
[48:39.380 --> 48:41.640]  I can see scrumpf on a
[48:41.640 --> 48:43.560]  file that I found in the Control Universe
[48:43.560 --> 48:44.540]  that feels appropriate.
[48:48.500 --> 48:49.880]  Overabundance of scrumpf.
[48:52.760 --> 48:53.900]  Nice pustule kill.
[48:54.500 --> 48:56.060]  Oh shit, he's still alive. Never mind, never mind.
[48:56.640 --> 48:56.960]  Get him!
[48:57.980 --> 48:58.700]  Oh, he's back up.
[49:03.600 --> 49:04.480]  Is he dead?
[49:04.960 --> 49:05.600]  There we go.
[49:06.980 --> 49:08.200]  Oh shit, another one.
[49:09.380 --> 49:10.560]  Aw, they're the worst.
[49:15.220 --> 49:16.840]  They're like those inflatable
[49:16.840 --> 49:18.980]  Halloween costumes that make it look like you're being
[49:18.980 --> 49:19.940]  abducted by an alien.
[49:20.800 --> 49:21.180]  Yeah.
[49:22.860 --> 49:24.280]  There's another one coming in too.
[49:24.380 --> 49:25.760]  I'm definitely gonna go down.
[49:26.280 --> 49:28.140]  Is he down? Oh my god.
[49:28.640 --> 49:29.540]  Gavin and I are both down.
[49:30.920 --> 49:31.300]  Alright.
[49:32.440 --> 49:32.980]  Okay, I'm getting you.
[49:38.450 --> 49:39.210]  Behind you.
[49:40.590 --> 49:40.970]  Jesus.
[49:44.590 --> 49:46.390]  It's windy. Did you do that?
[49:46.470 --> 49:48.290]  Oh, that's your special. I thought they did that.
[49:48.390 --> 49:49.190]  I was like, oh my god.
[49:49.190 --> 49:50.790]  No, it's my tornado of coins.
[49:51.010 --> 49:51.950]  Okay, I'm getting you.
[49:52.610 --> 49:57.230]  I got some wrenching to do through here.
[49:58.010 --> 50:00.010]  We need to get out.
[50:02.210 --> 50:03.230]  I've used half of my ammo
[50:03.230 --> 50:04.850]  just trying to fight my way out of the ammo room.
[50:12.610 --> 50:14.910]  Why does my flashlight suck?
[50:17.830 --> 50:20.070]  Is it something with the scrumpf?
[50:20.950 --> 50:22.230]  Fucking up my flashlight?
[50:24.310 --> 50:26.190]  Okay, I'm gonna start repairing these hoses.
[50:28.390 --> 50:29.190]  Oh my god.
[50:29.990 --> 50:31.230]  It takes so much ammo to
[50:32.230 --> 50:33.730]  blow through all these things.
[50:40.200 --> 50:41.120]  Oh, shit!
[50:43.680 --> 50:44.420]  What's up, Gav?
[50:44.780 --> 50:47.360]  Well, I was repairing and some scrumpf grew back
[50:47.360 --> 50:49.400]  over the thing I was repairing and it exploded in my face.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.280]  Okay, I found another shelter.
[50:51.280 --> 50:52.700]  I'm opening it.
[50:54.900 --> 50:56.540]  Ready for enemies.
[50:56.940 --> 50:59.640]  Oh shit, I'm covered in scrumpf.
[51:01.680 --> 51:03.360]  There's showers and ammo over here.
[51:04.400 --> 51:06.260]  I just haven't been able to find anything.
[51:06.460 --> 51:08.960]  I've been trying to navigate through the scrumpf
[51:08.960 --> 51:09.820]  and it's hard to see.
[51:11.700 --> 51:12.320]  I need help.
[51:13.620 --> 51:14.580]  We'll be there in a minute.
[51:14.580 --> 51:16.840]  Oh my god.
[51:27.900 --> 51:29.040]  I'm coming to you, Gav.
[51:30.280 --> 51:31.240]  Let's get around them.
[51:32.500 --> 51:33.300]  I gotta...
[51:33.300 --> 51:34.560]  There we go, he's down.
[51:40.050 --> 51:41.170]  Apostral man is dead.
[51:42.750 --> 51:44.030]  Okay, I'm gonna support you.
[51:45.850 --> 51:46.910]  Okay, big ball.
[51:47.530 --> 51:48.570]  Hey, Gav. What's up?
[51:48.690 --> 51:49.010]  You okay?
[51:49.010 --> 51:49.130]  I'm okay.
[51:50.450 --> 51:51.150]  I'm alright.
[51:51.730 --> 51:53.130]  Okay, sweet.
[51:54.170 --> 51:56.430]  Just gotta try repairing these things again.
[51:58.950 --> 52:01.370]  This place is so huge.
[52:01.770 --> 52:03.390]  It grows back so quickly over here.
[52:03.410 --> 52:03.750]  It's so shit.
[52:06.770 --> 52:08.650]  I think that's what the little raspberries are for.
[52:08.730 --> 52:10.850]  They're permanent clears.
[52:11.550 --> 52:12.030]  You shoot them.
[52:12.330 --> 52:13.430]  Geoff, there's a charge thing on this.
[52:13.430 --> 52:20.920]  Oh, nice.
[52:20.940 --> 52:23.160]  Can I manually calibrate the emitter?
[52:24.380 --> 52:25.540]  Is that where we're at?
[52:27.100 --> 52:28.700]  I need to freaking shower again.
[52:29.820 --> 52:30.280]  Here.
[52:31.120 --> 52:32.040]  Geoff, I got you.
[52:32.980 --> 52:34.540]  Thank you. I don't know what I'm doing here.
[52:38.800 --> 52:40.560]  I think the scrumpf is like,
[52:40.780 --> 52:42.080]  fucking us up with this thing.
[52:43.060 --> 52:45.060]  I think we gotta keep the scrumpf off it.
[52:45.840 --> 52:46.980]  I'll get you in a sec.
[52:46.980 --> 52:47.020]  I'll get you in a sec.
[52:50.860 --> 52:52.120]  I'm working on getting you.
[53:01.470 --> 53:02.770]  Okay, we're good.
[53:08.010 --> 53:08.750]  Watch out, Geoff.
[53:10.290 --> 53:11.750]  We want to take a minute to explore,
[53:11.890 --> 53:13.110]  just to see if we can find...
[53:13.110 --> 53:15.470]  Okay, I found some folders down here.
[53:17.730 --> 53:18.750]  Oh my god.
[53:19.590 --> 53:20.910]  This is so bad.
[53:21.610 --> 53:22.330]  Found a shelter.
[53:24.210 --> 53:25.350]  Oh my god.
[53:25.350 --> 53:25.890]  This is so bad.
[53:27.190 --> 53:28.970]  Oh my god.
[53:33.560 --> 53:35.340]  We gotta take out Solomon Brown.
[53:36.520 --> 53:37.500]  Oh, Andrew?
[53:38.620 --> 53:39.060]  Yeah?
[53:39.680 --> 53:41.600]  This is so bad.
[53:43.200 --> 53:44.660]  Just head over here.
[53:45.300 --> 53:46.040]  I'm right with you.
[53:46.180 --> 53:47.020]  It's not too bad over here.
[53:48.620 --> 53:49.140]  Oh no.
[53:51.000 --> 53:51.540]  Oh, I'm stuck.
[53:51.540 --> 53:52.580]  We're working on getting to you, Gavin.
[53:55.280 --> 53:56.980]  I'm hot and I'm pink.
[53:58.300 --> 53:58.820]  Hehe.
[54:00.240 --> 54:01.520]  Any grenades in here?
[54:03.480 --> 54:04.180]  He's a salmon
[54:04.180 --> 54:04.980]  as a shorts.
[54:08.770 --> 54:09.290]  Clear.
[54:10.310 --> 54:10.750]  Here.
[54:11.650 --> 54:12.310]  Still in trouble?
[54:13.290 --> 54:14.830]  No, I'm picking up folders. Be greedy.
[54:14.950 --> 54:16.610]  Good job.
[54:20.940 --> 54:22.060]  Did you kill Solomon Grundy
[54:22.060 --> 54:22.800]  or whatever his name was?
[54:25.600 --> 54:26.920]  Solomon Kane, I believe.
[54:29.180 --> 54:29.660]  Hey.
[54:31.520 --> 54:32.940]  Let's turn the power on here
[54:32.940 --> 54:33.940]  so we can see.
[54:36.300 --> 54:37.420]  Someone say wrench!
[54:38.220 --> 54:39.500]  That makes it a lot easier.
[54:39.580 --> 54:40.000]  Thank you.
[54:41.860 --> 54:44.880]  I know that no one said wrench, but...
[54:44.880 --> 54:46.200]  I appreciate it.
[54:46.220 --> 54:46.860]  I thought it, yeah.
[54:48.760 --> 54:49.760]  We got more guys?
[54:51.420 --> 54:53.840]  I'm gonna try and stick all as a team.
[54:56.660 --> 54:57.060]  Okay.
[54:58.860 --> 54:59.660]  Go upstairs?
[55:00.000 --> 55:00.040]  Yeah.
[55:02.760 --> 55:03.940]  So we're just walking our way back?
[55:04.660 --> 55:04.960]  Yeah.
[55:05.200 --> 55:06.720]  It says to interact with this thing.
[55:10.430 --> 55:11.330]  Maybe it's a bug
[55:11.330 --> 55:12.610]  because I finished it.
[55:12.630 --> 55:14.390]  That was the last objective we needed.
[55:15.310 --> 55:16.810]  I was messing with that.
[55:16.990 --> 55:18.570]  Well, I didn't keep up with you guys
[55:18.570 --> 55:19.490]  and now I'm...
[55:21.730 --> 55:22.650]  regretting my decision.
[55:23.970 --> 55:25.470]  Still exploring a little bit.
[55:30.580 --> 55:31.100]  Alright.
[55:31.500 --> 55:32.160]  Is that a folder?
[55:32.380 --> 55:32.920]  Or is that...
[55:32.920 --> 55:36.360]  How do we get back?
[55:38.060 --> 55:38.640]  Nobody knows.
[55:39.420 --> 55:40.260]  There's no way to know.
[55:46.630 --> 55:48.350]  Where we're going, we don't need scrump.
[55:51.510 --> 55:52.570]  Did you find it, Gav?
[55:52.890 --> 55:53.110]  Yeah.
[55:57.330 --> 55:58.850]  It's disturbingly empty
[55:58.850 --> 55:59.450]  back here.
[56:01.030 --> 56:02.470]  We're dragging behind.
[56:02.730 --> 56:03.470]  But I'm on my way.
[56:09.940 --> 56:12.160]  It's like a completely different level
[56:12.160 --> 56:13.000]  with all the lights on.
[56:13.280 --> 56:15.220]  It is so much easier to see.
[56:15.360 --> 56:16.020]  Oh, powerful enemy.
[56:18.580 --> 56:19.580]  Henry Harris.
[56:24.860 --> 56:25.980]  You know what would be cool?
[56:26.220 --> 56:27.860]  If one day we were playing this game
[56:27.860 --> 56:29.900]  and it was like powerful enemy
[56:29.900 --> 56:32.240]  and then Henry Dillman spawned.
[56:40.080 --> 56:41.160]  Get fucked.
[56:42.540 --> 56:44.300]  You two are messing up, Henry.
[56:44.860 --> 56:46.620]  Yeah, I was just staggering in
[56:46.620 --> 56:47.100]  with the shotgun.
[56:47.740 --> 56:48.040]  Nice.
[56:49.900 --> 56:52.180]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[56:54.000 --> 56:54.940]  I'm working on it.
[57:02.020 --> 57:03.020]  I'm back at the elevator.
[57:03.480 --> 57:03.680]  Okay.
[57:04.320 --> 57:05.740]  I'm on fire in here.
[57:07.100 --> 57:07.860]  That's perfect.
[57:12.850 --> 57:13.570]  I'm calling it.
[57:13.570 --> 57:15.590]  Well, okay.
[57:20.860 --> 57:22.600]  Got pink again.
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.540]  I think I lost you guys.
[57:30.740 --> 57:33.860]  Okay, I'm here.
[57:34.900 --> 57:35.500]  Welcome.
[57:42.260 --> 57:43.460]  Nice.
[57:47.750 --> 57:49.410]  Okay, flipped up.
[57:50.430 --> 57:50.990]  Closing.
[57:50.990 --> 57:51.070]  Closing.
[57:53.830 --> 57:54.710]  Hell yeah.
[57:55.110 --> 57:56.050]  No, Geoff.
[57:57.470 --> 57:58.590]  You son of a bitch.
[58:03.540 --> 58:03.980]  Easy.
[58:05.120 --> 58:06.200]  That was fun.
[58:06.460 --> 58:08.300]  That was fun as cocoa.
[58:08.340 --> 58:10.320]  Well, that was another episode
[58:10.320 --> 58:12.420]  of FBC Farbrick. I'm sure we'll come back
[58:12.420 --> 58:14.200]  with at least one more because there's, I think,
[58:14.260 --> 58:15.920]  one or two more missions left.
[58:16.680 --> 58:17.000]  Wrap up.
[58:17.020 --> 58:19.920]  One more mission for us to wrap up, yeah. Freezer duty.
[58:20.900 --> 58:21.300]  Interesting.
[58:21.540 --> 58:23.700]  Well, there's kind of space for another one. I'm curious
[58:23.700 --> 58:26.240]  if that's for DLC or if that...
[58:26.240 --> 58:28.040]  Oh, we're starting a game for some reason.
[58:28.380 --> 58:29.920]  Canceled it. We're not doing that.
[58:30.360 --> 58:32.380]  Thank you so much
[58:32.380 --> 58:33.960]  for watching. Make sure to check out our
[58:33.960 --> 58:36.020]  Patreon. Gavin just left the game.
[58:36.120 --> 58:38.000]  I feel like in panic of the game starting.
[58:38.940 --> 58:39.740]  Make sure...
[58:39.740 --> 58:41.020]  Patreon on the Regulation Pod
[58:41.680 --> 58:44.000]  as well as Regulatrion.com is where you can find
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.900]  that. Thank you so much for watching.
[58:46.220 --> 58:47.360]  We'll be back at some point.
[58:47.360 --> 58:48.800]  Love you! Bye!
[58:49.260 --> 58:49.940]  Bye-bye!
