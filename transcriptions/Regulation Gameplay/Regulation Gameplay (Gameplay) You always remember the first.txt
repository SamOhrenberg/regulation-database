[00:00.000 --> 00:02.360]  Do you remember the first movie you watched that was bad?
[00:02.780 --> 00:04.640]  Like, I think about that all the time as a kid.
[00:04.780 --> 00:05.680]  Nothing was bad.
[00:06.260 --> 00:07.280]  Everything was fine.
[00:07.340 --> 00:09.420]  Are you talking about when I was aware that it was bad?
[00:09.780 --> 00:12.280]  Yeah, like when it sunk in and you're like,
[00:12.300 --> 00:13.300]  oh, this isn't good.
[00:15.400 --> 00:16.560]  No, because I like,
[00:17.480 --> 00:18.720]  you know, like every other kid
[00:18.720 --> 00:20.800]  in the 90s or whatever, I like really shitty movies.
[00:21.180 --> 00:21.960]  So, I don't know.
[00:22.100 --> 00:24.900]  I think when you watch Three Ninjas
[00:24.900 --> 00:26.940]  and stuff when you're a kid, you just have no idea.
[00:27.400 --> 00:27.740]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27.740 --> 00:29.760]  I really can't remember
[00:30.660 --> 00:31.020]  like,
[00:31.120 --> 00:33.460]  what was like the first bad movie.
[00:33.560 --> 00:34.180]  That's a tough one.
[00:34.620 --> 00:36.660]  Leave a comment down below.
[00:36.760 --> 00:40.060]  Let us know the first bad movie that you remember watching as a kid.
[00:40.800 --> 00:41.580]  That's engagement, baby.
[00:41.580 --> 00:43.300]  I think Gavin would say The Tuxedo.
[00:43.840 --> 00:44.860]  Yeah, we would yell at him and say,
[00:44.960 --> 00:46.100]  no, we said bad movie.
[00:46.420 --> 00:47.520]  And then he would laugh.
