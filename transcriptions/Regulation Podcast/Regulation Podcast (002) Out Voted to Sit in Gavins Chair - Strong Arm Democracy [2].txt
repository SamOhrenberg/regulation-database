[00:00.000 --> 00:06.960]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number two
[00:08.200 --> 00:11.700]  under the current name. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Andrew Panton,
[00:12.220 --> 00:16.200]  Gavin Free, Eric and Nick somewhere in the background. And take it away, Gavin.
[00:16.600 --> 00:20.320]  I like that Eric typically types in the Discord as you're doing the intro
[00:20.320 --> 00:24.760]  the episode number because, you know, it's historically been like 192 or whatever.
[00:25.020 --> 00:28.040]  He wrote episode two. I feel like we could have figured that out.
[00:28.040 --> 00:34.060]  No, I agree. I agree. But I figure, you know, we have a good thing going and I feel good about
[00:34.060 --> 00:39.160]  letting you know through this chat. We'll keep it consistent. If Nick is right, why risk it?
[00:39.300 --> 00:43.380]  It helps me because when I go back in a week to do the thumbnail, it's hard to figure out
[00:43.380 --> 00:46.260]  where the episode started because usually there's just a bunch of... There we go.
[00:46.460 --> 00:50.560]  There's just a bunch of nonsense. And sometimes there have been multiple occasions where I've put
[00:50.560 --> 00:54.660]  photos up in the episode dump that weren't a part of the episode. They were just shit we were
[00:54.660 --> 00:59.320]  talking about before or after and it confuses the audience. So I really need the episode two,
[00:59.460 --> 01:03.440]  Marco. Thank you. But I will say, Gavin, I totally agree. And if this was somebody
[01:03.440 --> 01:06.800]  else doing it, I would have been all over them for saying episode two as well.
[01:08.120 --> 01:11.180]  I feel like Regulation Podcast is going pretty well so far.
[01:11.580 --> 01:15.400]  Amazing start. Thank you so much to all the people that have supported us via Patreon.
[01:15.920 --> 01:19.700]  There's been an unbelievable amount of support. It has been wonderful and
[01:20.580 --> 01:22.440]  overwhelming in a very amazing way.
[01:25.380 --> 01:29.220]  Apparently not to everybody else. Nobody else agrees. Jesus fucking Christ.
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.740]  What's wrong with all of you? I really, really thought that Geoff would start saying something.
[01:33.940 --> 01:38.180]  I just couldn't believe he didn't. Oh, really? No, I was expecting Eric to say something.
[01:38.420 --> 01:42.160]  Oh. Yeah, I was waiting for Eric. Just any of you. If any of you could have said something.
[01:42.160 --> 01:45.840]  I mean, I'm muted. You can see very clearly that like I'm muted when I'm not talking.
[01:46.180 --> 01:49.660]  I mean, technically we do everything in ANEG. So like Andrew spoke,
[01:49.960 --> 01:53.200]  it should have been, he should have thrown to Nick and then Eric and then it was my turn.
[01:53.200 --> 01:55.080]  Okay, then we'll do it. All right, then go ahead, Nick.
[01:55.500 --> 01:58.620]  I'm blown away. Thank you for all the support and the love that you've given us
[01:58.620 --> 02:02.260]  and following our Patreon. And if not our new YouTube page as well.
[02:03.200 --> 02:10.000]  Great. Hey guys, I want to say I'm sorry for the rocky start we had as the regulation podcast.
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.160]  I apologize for the confusion that came through telling you to download the episodes,
[02:15.320 --> 02:20.160]  which I never should have done clearly. I apologize for any confusion that caused,
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.980]  but I do want to say I am overwhelmed by your support and I want to thank you
[02:24.980 --> 02:30.040]  for following us as difficult as it was to find these episodes. Thank you very, very much.
[02:30.100 --> 02:31.720]  So wait, they shouldn't download it?
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.320]  I just shouldn't have said anything. I didn't find it to be confusing.
[02:35.540 --> 02:38.620]  When I said download the episode, it helps us. And then people went,
[02:38.740 --> 02:41.940]  what if I download it on YouTube? And I just went, this is, we're already,
[02:42.980 --> 02:46.520]  this is, we're gone. We're beyond. They're like, what if I pirate it? And it's like,
[02:46.520 --> 02:51.300]  what are you talking about? This is insane. So I just shouldn't have said anything.
[02:51.540 --> 02:54.680]  I apologize for the rocky start with where we had to upload and everything,
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.040]  but hopefully by this point we have it all sorted out. You guys are following where you can
[02:58.040 --> 02:59.380]  and we appreciate your support.
[03:00.220 --> 03:07.240]  Hey y'all, it's your boy Lil Geoffy here. And I just wanted to reiterate what my coworkers
[03:07.240 --> 03:12.020]  and friends have said. What an amazing show of support. What does it mean the world to us?
[03:12.020 --> 03:18.960]  If I could, if I could, if I could explain it in such a way, it's like you as a community have
[03:18.960 --> 03:25.220]  given my heart, my very heart, the biggest throbbing boner a heart has ever had. I feel
[03:25.220 --> 03:31.740]  like I'm just, my heart is just pumping love and blood and success, like, like just like good
[03:31.740 --> 03:38.540]  feelings and jizz. And I just, I feel like I'm going to explode with, with cheer if at all
[03:38.540 --> 03:44.280]  possible. So thank you so much for my heart boner and for all of the support. Gavin,
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.000]  I believe it's your turn.
[03:46.220 --> 03:52.660]  I hate this bit so much. But everything should be in place now, right? We've, we've acquired
[03:52.660 --> 03:53.420]  some things.
[03:54.060 --> 03:54.400]  Hopefully.
[03:54.680 --> 03:54.880]  Have we?
[03:55.020 --> 03:59.500]  I mean, I mean, we've said yes. You got paperwork?
[03:59.980 --> 04:00.620]  Yeah, right.
[04:01.040 --> 04:02.080]  I'm all done with the paperwork.
[04:02.500 --> 04:05.880]  But that's not the end of all of this. And we're in the middle of just waiting to hear
[04:05.880 --> 04:08.100]  back on some stuff and then we'll be able to turn everything over.
[04:08.540 --> 04:10.140]  We might be getting our bleep back.
[04:10.720 --> 04:11.740]  Oh my God.
[04:12.100 --> 04:16.260]  We'll see. Let's wait and see. Let's wait and see. I do. I, I don't want to risk it.
[04:16.320 --> 04:19.780]  I wouldn't even throw it out there that whether or not the bleep is here or not.
[04:19.840 --> 04:21.720]  I feel like he said it. We might.
[04:21.840 --> 04:24.940]  Well, I mean, we own it. I mean, it's paid for.
[04:25.260 --> 04:30.140]  Yes, exactly. So that's, but like, you know, the actual ownership and reversion,
[04:30.200 --> 04:32.340]  I just wouldn't test it. I just wouldn't say the old name.
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.000]  Well, the thing that we, well, Gavin, you bought, we bought a thing.
[04:36.480 --> 04:36.660]  Yeah.
[04:36.660 --> 04:39.220]  Right. And now we own a thing in theory.
[04:39.540 --> 04:41.620]  I don't know why we can't talk about the thing we own.
[04:42.120 --> 04:42.580]  I don't know.
[04:44.200 --> 04:46.700]  Is it a zoo? Nick asked if it's a zoo. We bought a zoo.
[04:47.220 --> 04:49.620]  Technically speaking, you're Eric's boss at the moment, Gavin.
[04:50.780 --> 04:52.300]  We're in a transitional phase.
[04:53.720 --> 04:57.040]  Oh, I like this. Eric, when do you want your review to be?
[04:58.360 --> 05:00.080]  I would say this time next year.
[05:00.720 --> 05:02.060]  Okay. Let me write that down.
[05:03.580 --> 05:04.320]  You got it.
[05:04.320 --> 05:06.620]  Set alarm for one year from now.
[05:06.800 --> 05:10.220]  It's just funny because as of today, it's still a little murky,
[05:10.260 --> 05:13.540]  but by the time this episode comes out, it will be 100% done.
[05:13.600 --> 05:14.860]  That's why I was bringing it up.
[05:15.020 --> 05:16.860]  I know. I know. I know that's why you're bringing it up.
[05:17.100 --> 05:18.500]  I think Eric is worried it won't be.
[05:18.780 --> 05:21.100]  The hilarious thing is we're doing a twofer today,
[05:21.220 --> 05:23.900]  so we're going to immediately roll into episode three right after this,
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.000]  and we still won't be able to talk about it.
[05:26.100 --> 05:27.740]  Oh, it is definitely gonna be done there.
[05:28.080 --> 05:28.280]  Yeah.
[05:28.800 --> 05:32.640]  Before we move on, I need to just take the show hostage for a minute
[05:32.640 --> 05:34.340]  because I keep putting something off.
[05:34.540 --> 05:35.960]  I keep delaying this.
[05:36.420 --> 05:38.280]  I'm still using my old chair
[05:38.280 --> 05:41.720]  because I keep waiting to do a thing where I sit in the chair for the first time.
[05:41.880 --> 05:42.180]  Oh, yeah.
[05:42.420 --> 05:43.020]  And it never comes.
[05:43.300 --> 05:43.340]  What?
[05:44.240 --> 05:45.140]  I've been waiting.
[05:45.620 --> 05:47.180]  You could have done it last week.
[05:47.560 --> 05:49.180]  I know, but it never came up.
[05:49.280 --> 05:50.860]  I never found a way to interject it.
[05:50.860 --> 05:51.960]  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[05:52.040 --> 05:52.960]  Just let him do the chair thing.
[05:53.020 --> 05:54.640]  So do you want to do it right now?
[05:54.960 --> 05:56.480]  I'm standing up.
[05:56.640 --> 05:58.940]  I'm about to sit in my new Herman Miller.
[05:59.360 --> 06:00.540]  I've been waiting months.
[06:00.540 --> 06:02.940]  It doesn't make sense to do it, like, four minutes in.
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.820]  Why wouldn't you wait until the end of the episode to be, like, a big grin?
[06:05.820 --> 06:07.800]  Because I want to sit in the chair!
[06:07.920 --> 06:09.780]  I'm so sick of this broken...
[06:09.780 --> 06:11.960]  It's just weird to do it mid-episode, dude.
[06:12.040 --> 06:15.780]  What if you start the next episode in the new chair and we'll see if we're better?
[06:16.460 --> 06:17.920]  Oh, we can compare the performances.
[06:18.180 --> 06:18.580]  Yeah, we'll compare.
[06:18.580 --> 06:19.800]  I definitely agree with that.
[06:19.920 --> 06:21.160]  I agree with that also, yeah.
[06:21.680 --> 06:22.840]  Hang on. Hang on.
[06:23.020 --> 06:23.120]  No.
[06:23.580 --> 06:26.880]  Now, we are all co-owners of this company, and I think we can take a vote.
[06:27.360 --> 06:27.720]  Oh!
[06:28.180 --> 06:29.300]  I vote for next episode.
[06:29.300 --> 06:31.140]  I also vote for next episode.
[06:31.240 --> 06:31.520]  Next episode!
[06:32.020 --> 06:33.480]  I vote for this episode.
[06:33.860 --> 06:37.920]  Oh, I'm sorry. Unfortunately, Andrew and Gavin, you are out-voting.
[06:38.060 --> 06:39.140]  Andrew, I did what I could.
[06:39.840 --> 06:41.500]  Majority rules have to be determined.
[06:41.980 --> 06:42.880]  That's such a lie!
[06:43.140 --> 06:44.340]  What do you mean, no, I didn't.
[06:45.400 --> 06:47.020]  You put this in motion!
[06:48.000 --> 06:48.640]  Oh, yeah.
[06:48.800 --> 06:49.360]  You kicked the ball!
[06:49.840 --> 06:55.060]  Does anybody think that it's gonna be, like, a reverse Icy Hot on the Balls situation,
[06:55.240 --> 06:58.200]  where Andrew ceases to be as funny because he's uncomfortable?
[06:58.660 --> 07:00.000]  Oh, he'll fall asleep.
[07:00.020 --> 07:03.380]  Like, maybe we'll have to put thumbtacks in the bottom of the chair or something,
[07:03.500 --> 07:05.440]  just to agitate you a little bit to keep you alert.
[07:05.980 --> 07:09.640]  Oh, I'm plenty agitated. You don't need to put in the thumbtacks. I'm annoyed.
[07:10.100 --> 07:13.880]  You know, I think, technically, was that given to you under the previous podcast, that chair?
[07:14.520 --> 07:15.860]  Yeah. Yeah, I guess it was.
[07:15.860 --> 07:17.860]  I think, technically, currently, that's my chair.
[07:18.220 --> 07:20.220]  I believe Gavin owns that chair.
[07:20.520 --> 07:21.600]  Yeah, that's pretty...
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.300]  I believe Gavin bought your chair.
[07:23.560 --> 07:26.400]  So if you could just pop that to the side for now, I'd really appreciate it.
[07:27.420 --> 07:28.400]  God damn it.
[07:31.500 --> 07:33.640]  Give me a second to put this chair away.
[07:33.900 --> 07:35.680]  I was really excited to sit in it.
[07:35.940 --> 07:38.120]  Keep it close. Next episode's right around the corner.
[07:43.100 --> 07:46.280]  God damn it. I hate you guys. I love you guys, but I hate you guys.
[07:46.600 --> 07:47.740]  We're just trying to be fair about it.
[07:47.860 --> 07:49.620]  I just want to sit in the new chair.
[07:50.420 --> 07:52.160]  I've had this chair for so long.
[07:52.420 --> 07:54.820]  The problem is, you could have done it at any point in the past,
[07:54.840 --> 07:56.020]  and you're the reason you didn't.
[07:56.520 --> 07:57.640]  Because I said I would.
[07:58.140 --> 08:01.080]  Yeah, what you've done is you've built up this really funny bit,
[08:01.120 --> 08:02.640]  and now we're all committed to your bit.
[08:02.960 --> 08:03.200]  Yeah.
[08:06.440 --> 08:10.840]  I was looking over my notes to try to get ready for today's episodes,
[08:10.880 --> 08:13.520]  of which there are painfully few notes, by the way.
[08:13.560 --> 08:14.520]  I have very little to talk about.
[08:14.740 --> 08:16.760]  And I got so confused by my notes.
[08:16.980 --> 08:19.120]  The number one note I had was head sheen.
[08:19.580 --> 08:23.860]  I probably spent a good three minutes at that coffee shop this morning,
[08:23.860 --> 08:26.280]  trying to figure out what the fuck I wrote.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[08:28.300 --> 08:31.800]  I eventually got there, but I was so fucking mad at myself
[08:31.800 --> 08:34.040]  for not explaining what I was thinking there.
[08:34.520 --> 08:38.080]  Yeah, we did a Sloppy Joe's Bingo recently under the new podcast,
[08:38.220 --> 08:39.920]  and I think it was our best one.
[08:40.600 --> 08:43.920]  And we've thought about changing up the list,
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.480]  adding some new things, and head sheen was one of the new spots.
[08:47.480 --> 08:49.640]  Yeah, I have overstayed your welcome.
[08:49.880 --> 08:50.600]  Head sheen.
[08:50.700 --> 08:51.800]  Dog out too late.
[08:51.860 --> 08:52.860]  That's what helped me figure it out.
[08:52.860 --> 08:54.200]  New boot goofing.
[08:54.580 --> 08:56.200]  Dickhead truck and move along.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.820]  Move along did not help at all.
[08:59.220 --> 09:01.840]  We were so close to losing pink taxi.
[09:02.560 --> 09:05.140]  And then pink taxi showed up. Terrible.
[09:05.580 --> 09:06.280]  In a big way.
[09:06.300 --> 09:06.560]  Oh, clown car.
[09:06.980 --> 09:08.300]  Clown car. We gotta add clown car.
[09:08.880 --> 09:09.320]  Clown car.
[09:09.800 --> 09:11.200]  I got my wheelchair finally.
[09:11.660 --> 09:13.980]  I've been waiting three different Sloppy Joe's.
[09:14.240 --> 09:15.140]  Oh yeah, you got a convoy of them.
[09:15.660 --> 09:16.220]  I won.
[09:16.580 --> 09:19.140]  Finally, Eric lost a Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[09:19.200 --> 09:19.820]  It was a great night.
[09:20.020 --> 09:20.300]  Yeah.
[09:20.480 --> 09:22.580]  Do you know what I found out today at coffee?
[09:23.460 --> 09:31.820]  That at his old job, Geoff used to sit on a raised platform above all the other employees.
[09:34.060 --> 09:36.220]  I don't know why this sticks out to you.
[09:36.380 --> 09:38.280]  I didn't choose to sit there.
[09:38.440 --> 09:40.160]  It was my job to sit there.
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.800]  I was paid to sit there.
[09:42.340 --> 09:44.780]  I was in charge of all of those people.
[09:45.000 --> 09:45.820]  They were my minions.
[09:46.240 --> 09:47.620]  Like a god in a prison.
[09:47.620 --> 09:51.720]  Yeah, I was Steve Carell and they were my little worker tech minions.
[09:52.040 --> 09:58.700]  And I had to keep an eye on them all, man.
[09:58.880 --> 10:01.300]  It was Jason and Nick and a bunch of other lunatics.
[10:01.660 --> 10:03.060]  Becca and fucking Gus.
[10:04.200 --> 10:05.320]  They're maniacs.
[10:05.440 --> 10:06.500]  You sat above Gus?
[10:06.860 --> 10:07.260]  Yeah.
[10:07.880 --> 10:13.520]  Dude, but what that really meant though, is that like a Panopticon, everyone could see you.
[10:14.560 --> 10:15.120]  Panopticon?
[10:15.960 --> 10:17.100]  Is that a Pokemon?
[10:17.640 --> 10:18.780]  What's a Panopticon?
[10:19.300 --> 10:24.000]  I think it was a type of like circular jail where like one guard could watch every prisoner.
[10:24.240 --> 10:24.520]  Oh, wow.
[10:24.560 --> 10:26.500]  Oh, we went to one of those, huh?
[10:26.860 --> 10:28.100]  I only know it because of...
[10:28.660 --> 10:29.780]  This is crazy.
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.980]  I think it was a way of having a lot of prisoners and very few staff.
[10:34.280 --> 10:37.420]  But I know that word because there's a Panopticon in control.
[10:37.980 --> 10:40.200]  We did that in...
[10:40.980 --> 10:41.940]  Fuck, where were we?
[10:42.020 --> 10:42.460]  Louisiana?
[10:42.920 --> 10:44.740]  That jail was a Panopticon, remember Geoff?
[10:45.200 --> 10:45.780]  Was it?
[10:46.240 --> 10:47.120]  I'm pretty sure.
[10:47.120 --> 10:48.680]  Have I been in a Panopticon?
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.960]  We did that joke, Daniel Fadello did that joke we're never supposed to do on set.
[10:53.300 --> 10:54.000]  What was the joke?
[10:56.760 --> 11:00.780]  They made it look like somebody fell from the top or got hung or something.
[11:00.940 --> 11:01.660]  I can't remember exactly.
[11:02.260 --> 11:03.400]  It was a Haunter episode though.
[11:03.460 --> 11:04.120]  We did it in Haunter.
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.100]  Before today Gavin, if somebody asked you if you had played Lost Planet or been to a Panopticon,
[11:09.280 --> 11:10.300]  would your answer have been no?
[11:10.880 --> 11:11.580]  No, it would have been yes.
[11:12.080 --> 11:13.980]  Okay, well you just seemed like you didn't know.
[11:14.280 --> 11:15.200]  Because I went in control.
[11:16.820 --> 11:18.380]  That doesn't count.
[11:19.860 --> 11:21.880]  Hey Geoff, have you ever flown?
[11:22.780 --> 11:25.220]  Oh my god, yeah, I was flying earlier, thanks for asking.
[11:25.240 --> 11:26.900]  Have you ever done a 1080 on a snowboard?
[11:29.400 --> 11:31.120]  You ever dropped a nuke before?
[11:32.860 --> 11:33.660]  Hammered a Don?
[11:34.440 --> 11:35.180]  Dropped a what?
[11:35.640 --> 11:36.380]  Dropped a nuke.
[11:36.820 --> 11:37.060]  Oh.
[11:37.360 --> 11:38.440]  Like Fallout 76?
[11:39.040 --> 11:39.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:40.040 --> 11:40.460]  Yeah.
[11:40.980 --> 11:41.400]  Yeah.
[11:41.560 --> 11:41.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:42.320 --> 11:44.740]  I wonder if I'll ever be able to release all that footage.
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.140]  I took of the crew of Haunter when they all lost their freaking minds and refused to film.
[11:50.660 --> 11:53.060]  Oh, that was a frustrating night, man.
[11:53.220 --> 11:54.100]  That was frustrating.
[11:55.100 --> 11:57.900]  We had a lot of believers on the crew.
[11:58.300 --> 12:01.880]  And there was a, what someone deemed to be a supernatural experience.
[12:02.020 --> 12:05.700]  And then everyone legitimately freaked out for about two hours.
[12:06.080 --> 12:09.300]  They thought there were, they wouldn't film on account of real ghosts.
[12:09.460 --> 12:12.340]  They thought the ghost was real and everyone was like, I'm not going out there.
[12:12.420 --> 12:13.120]  I'm not, I'm not.
[12:13.900 --> 12:17.420]  One, one of the local crew, dude, it got so much worse.
[12:17.580 --> 12:22.720]  One of the local crew said they saw an orb and it chased them.
[12:23.100 --> 12:24.520]  And they refused.
[12:24.720 --> 12:28.060]  And they, they and other members of the crew just left.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.220]  We're like, we're not working the rest of the night.
[12:30.360 --> 12:31.500]  An orb chased me.
[12:31.580 --> 12:32.260]  It's going to kill me.
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.400]  And they just fucking left.
[12:34.040 --> 12:36.820]  The medic was checking someone out after something like this happened.
[12:36.900 --> 12:38.140]  And then the medic was freaking out.
[12:38.420 --> 12:39.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:39.880 --> 12:41.360]  Oh, I got so much good footage of that.
[12:41.360 --> 12:45.600]  People lost their fucking minds and I got, and there was some, it was interesting.
[12:46.200 --> 12:49.180]  There's some very tense conversations with producers going like,
[12:49.240 --> 12:50.420]  are you fucking serious right now?
[12:50.560 --> 12:52.300]  Are you really scared of a ghost right now?
[12:53.940 --> 12:56.500]  Well, because I think everyone was trying to do the responsible thing.
[12:56.660 --> 13:00.620]  Like the producer was trying to keep all the crew happy and stuff, but they weren't happy.
[13:01.400 --> 13:04.380]  So they were, they were like siding with the crew, which I guess
[13:04.380 --> 13:06.960]  if I was the producer, I would also do that.
[13:07.320 --> 13:08.960]  But no, you got to want everybody to feel safe.
[13:08.960 --> 13:11.400]  But as a ghost hunter, it's like, this is why we're doing it.
[13:11.440 --> 13:13.340]  We're trying to find a stupid fucking ghost.
[13:13.500 --> 13:15.120]  We were like, roll the damn cameras.
[13:15.300 --> 13:17.960]  Don't run away from the ghost, we run towards the ghost.
[13:18.300 --> 13:20.700]  Yeah, dude, I don't know if we can film this ghost show.
[13:20.800 --> 13:23.620]  I just saw a ghost show, I'm thinking that we shouldn't do this.
[13:24.240 --> 13:25.460]  It was surreal.
[13:25.740 --> 13:27.380]  I didn't know, I didn't know what to do.
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.200]  I just sat quietly and just had to wait it out.
[13:30.260 --> 13:30.560]  Wow.
[13:30.940 --> 13:35.040]  Do you think there's any job where that's a justifiable excuse for suddenly leaving work?
[13:35.600 --> 13:38.300]  Like you work at Subway and just like, now there's a ghost.
[13:38.340 --> 13:39.920]  I got chased by an orb in the kitchen.
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.440]  I'm going home.
[13:41.680 --> 13:42.560]  I would say cemetery.
[13:42.880 --> 13:44.040]  You're like groundskeeper at a cemetery.
[13:44.360 --> 13:45.600]  Oh, cemetery is a good one.
[13:45.960 --> 13:46.240]  Yeah.
[13:47.340 --> 13:48.840]  Just a half dug grave.
[13:49.220 --> 13:51.940]  I feel like if you tell any other person who works at a cemetery,
[13:52.120 --> 13:53.480]  I had to leave early, I saw a ghost.
[13:53.600 --> 13:55.400]  They'd be like, yeah, I got it.
[13:55.480 --> 13:55.920]  I got you.
[13:56.040 --> 13:56.300]  Yeah.
[13:57.240 --> 13:58.760]  An orb chased me.
[14:00.380 --> 14:02.960]  They got chased by Pac-Man and had to call out early.
[14:02.960 --> 14:05.160]  You know, all that, we did two seasons of that show.
[14:05.380 --> 14:06.860]  That only happened that time.
[14:06.980 --> 14:08.780]  Everybody else was totally had their shit together.
[14:08.900 --> 14:09.700]  Every other recording.
[14:09.840 --> 14:12.700]  It was just that because ghosts aren't real.
[14:12.960 --> 14:15.020]  So it didn't happen again.
[14:15.480 --> 14:15.720]  Whoa.
[14:16.060 --> 14:19.500]  It was definitely a more religious area.
[14:19.820 --> 14:20.340]  I'll say that.
[14:20.360 --> 14:22.480]  And that was, yeah, it was different values.
[14:22.880 --> 14:24.980]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eric, calm down there.
[14:25.320 --> 14:28.640]  If ghosts aren't real, explain how that guy got chased by an orb.
[14:31.600 --> 14:32.880]  You know what?
[14:33.140 --> 14:35.420]  Some things you just can't explain, I guess.
[14:35.720 --> 14:36.640]  You, you got me.
[14:36.960 --> 14:38.820]  Somebody hasn't seen Mind Freak.
[14:39.540 --> 14:43.220]  I was thinking about all the, uh, just the phone footage I've got from over the years
[14:43.220 --> 14:47.260]  and how a lot of it was filmed, you know, for the previous company.
[14:47.460 --> 14:50.960]  But a lot of it was filmed before I worked there.
[14:51.140 --> 14:53.900]  Like, because we were talking last week about Rain Run, right?
[14:54.520 --> 14:56.840]  That was filmed before that show existed.
[14:56.840 --> 15:02.680]  So technically, if I just take my footage and just recut it, it would be a brand new thing.
[15:02.840 --> 15:05.300]  And I'm thinking maybe we just uncensor your cock.
[15:05.660 --> 15:06.180]  What?
[15:06.340 --> 15:06.720]  Oh.
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.580]  Yeah, you want to re-release that video, but I'm swinging my dick everywhere while I'm bleeding
[15:14.580 --> 15:16.280]  and covered in glass and mud.
[15:16.280 --> 15:17.500]  Let's go behind the paint wall.
[15:17.980 --> 15:19.240]  It would be a new product.
[15:19.920 --> 15:20.500]  It's true.
[15:20.780 --> 15:21.300]  It's true.
[15:22.440 --> 15:25.640]  The Gavin cut is just dicks are shown.
[15:25.640 --> 15:27.040]  It's the only difference.
[15:27.260 --> 15:32.060]  Everything else, he just flips the, he just flips the bar so only the dick is visible.
[15:32.480 --> 15:34.000]  The rest of the screen's blacked out.
[15:35.200 --> 15:37.080]  It's this? Is this the thumbnail for it?
[15:37.500 --> 15:38.000]  Rain Run?
[15:38.440 --> 15:40.400]  Yeah, Geoff's cock fell out in the middle of that.
[15:41.420 --> 15:41.720]  Yeah.
[15:43.940 --> 15:48.420]  I, uh, we were running in the rain and because it was lightning and thundering and it was like
[15:48.420 --> 15:49.640]  shitting down rain.
[15:49.800 --> 15:52.840]  And so we were taking turns and filming it and it was my turn.
[15:52.840 --> 15:58.460]  I ran out into the street and I slid and I fucking went knee first into a bunch of gravel
[15:58.460 --> 16:01.000]  and it just ripped my shin and my knee.
[16:01.100 --> 16:04.840]  And I was covered in blood, blew out my pants.
[16:04.960 --> 16:07.080]  And I ran back in going, I'm in a lot of pain.
[16:07.140 --> 16:07.720]  I'm in a lot of pain.
[16:07.740 --> 16:08.180]  I'm really hurt.
[16:08.240 --> 16:08.620]  I'm really hurt.
[16:08.700 --> 16:09.480]  They're laughing at me.
[16:09.500 --> 16:13.580]  And I ran into the bathroom and I put my pants down, bent over to pull my pants down.
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.640]  And there's just like blood and skin and rocks and shit sticking out of my leg.
[16:17.640 --> 16:23.180]  And I went, oh, and I, I, I stood back up and I hit a glass countertop that had like all the
[16:23.180 --> 16:26.460]  deodorant and razors and soap and shit on it.
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.620]  And it shattered all around me on the ground with my dick out and blood everywhere.
[16:31.780 --> 16:33.100]  And then I was, it was just brutal.
[16:33.240 --> 16:34.040]  It was a long night.
[16:34.220 --> 16:35.300]  That sounds terrible.
[16:36.660 --> 16:37.980]  Gavin filmed the whole thing.
[16:38.260 --> 16:38.560]  That's true.
[16:38.780 --> 16:40.120]  I, and he still has it.
[16:41.260 --> 16:45.400]  He still has the uncensored dick just waiting.
[16:45.860 --> 16:49.360]  Were you holding onto that footage, Gavin, for some reason to use?
[16:50.260 --> 16:51.780]  Do you just save all your footage?
[16:52.140 --> 16:54.060]  He uses it pretty regularly, if you know what I mean.
[16:57.480 --> 17:01.820]  I feel like getting a gravel injury on your dick would be especially bad.
[17:02.300 --> 17:04.860]  I feel like gravel would struggle to, to hurt the dick.
[17:04.940 --> 17:06.580]  The dick just gets moved out the way.
[17:07.500 --> 17:10.840]  I don't, if you falling, I don't, I don't, I disagree.
[17:11.220 --> 17:14.620]  I feel like gravel is all like palm of hands and shins and knees.
[17:14.620 --> 17:16.380]  It's all the stuff that isn't malleable.
[17:16.840 --> 17:19.900]  Yeah, I feel like the, it's like a dick defense mechanism you have,
[17:19.960 --> 17:25.280]  is that it's so malleable it, it knows to avoid, it like pings off of danger.
[17:26.020 --> 17:28.780]  Like, I can't remember the last time I banged my dick on something.
[17:31.360 --> 17:32.840]  It has a lot of protection.
[17:33.580 --> 17:35.440]  In the scenario in which it's exposed.
[17:37.800 --> 17:42.660]  Anytime I think of banging dicks, I think of that survivor challenge where they blindfold
[17:42.660 --> 17:47.680]  everybody and they make the people on the tall platform and direct them through the maze,
[17:47.820 --> 17:52.020]  but it's all dick height and it's all like jagged wood sticking out.
[17:52.100 --> 17:54.300]  And people just rack themselves over and over again.
[17:54.900 --> 17:58.700]  They don't do that anymore. That was the ultimate survivor.
[17:58.820 --> 18:01.280]  They just kept dropping shit on each other's heads.
[18:01.840 --> 18:04.640]  Oh yeah, that's your penis.
[18:05.460 --> 18:07.220]  Your dick is gravel, Gavin.
[18:09.580 --> 18:11.420]  Everybody's dicks are Muhammad Ali.
[18:11.420 --> 18:15.280]  Can we motion track the text onto the box of glove? It just says gravel.
[18:17.140 --> 18:18.980]  Dick onto Muhammad Ali's head.
[18:20.380 --> 18:21.180]  Just dodging.
[18:22.460 --> 18:27.840]  Do you remember stuff at school? Like, do you remember having things at school that made you
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.560]  laugh and you couldn't, you couldn't laugh so you would always try and hold in the laughter
[18:31.560 --> 18:33.160]  and end up going like...
[18:34.120 --> 18:35.580]  Yeah, I think I talked about one.
[18:35.880 --> 18:39.700]  I remembered a recent one that I just couldn't, I could not hold in the laughter.
[18:39.700 --> 18:43.100]  It made me laugh like 20 minutes after the thing happened.
[18:43.560 --> 18:49.320]  I had this humanities teacher who, when the class was being too rowdy,
[18:49.760 --> 18:53.260]  he would just write on the corner of the whiteboard, he'd just make a small box,
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.060]  and then as more minutes passed, he would write a number in there.
[18:57.260 --> 19:01.500]  So if we were like dicking around for two minutes, he would just put a two in the box,
[19:01.880 --> 19:05.160]  and eventually it would get to the point where people would see like eight and be like,
[19:05.180 --> 19:07.180]  oh, we're going to miss the whole of break. So everyone would shut up.
[19:07.180 --> 19:12.840]  But once he, uh, we were doing like a projection, like the overhead projector thing.
[19:12.920 --> 19:16.940]  He pulled down the screen in front of the whiteboard and was projecting stuff.
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.780]  And the class was dicking around and he just quickly pulled out the marker and wrote the box,
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.340]  but he wrote it on the projection screen instead of the whiteboard.
[19:26.120 --> 19:30.700]  And everyone laughed. Everyone laughed and he was really, really annoyed.
[19:30.820 --> 19:33.640]  He was trying to rub it off. He couldn't get it off because it was fabric.
[19:34.680 --> 19:39.580]  And for some reason, every minute that passed, it would come back into my head.
[19:39.740 --> 19:45.140]  And I just kept laughing. And I was like laughing into my coat, into my fingers.
[19:45.260 --> 19:49.480]  I like shoved my hand over my mouth and I could not, it was the funniest thing
[19:49.480 --> 19:53.560]  in the world to me in that moment. And then as soon as I left the classroom,
[19:53.600 --> 19:57.140]  I was like, oh, wasn't that funny. But getting stuck in the moment,
[19:57.600 --> 20:00.640]  I just could not shift it. It was the funniest thing in the world.
[20:01.460 --> 20:07.200]  And it stayed on there for like two years. Every time I had a lesson in that room,
[20:07.420 --> 20:13.420]  there'd be just two lines making a corner in the top right of the projection screen.
[20:13.480 --> 20:15.000]  Was it funny every time you saw it?
[20:15.200 --> 20:19.000]  Yeah. Not as funny as the first time, but it did make me cackle every time.
[20:19.700 --> 20:23.160]  That was my question is how long it lasted. I'd like to imagine it's still there.
[20:23.840 --> 20:27.140]  Ah, that'd be so good. I don't think they use those projectors anymore.
[20:27.580 --> 20:29.380]  I can't imagine they would.
[20:29.380 --> 20:34.800]  Desktop overhead. Do you have anything in your classes that...
[20:34.800 --> 20:36.860]  What was the one you mentioned, Andrew, before? I can't remember.
[20:36.960 --> 20:45.600]  I had two. I had one where my mom included the book version of the Steve Martin Pink Panther
[20:45.600 --> 20:51.880]  movie. And there's just images from the film. I just could not... the camouflage just kept getting
[20:51.880 --> 20:57.820]  me. The other one that I just remembered, and it's not, as you said, it is so not funny,
[20:57.820 --> 21:02.700]  but it's just you're in that loop of it is the funniest thing ever. And then you become aware
[21:02.700 --> 21:07.340]  that it's not as funny and that just makes it funnier. We had to do like a creative writing
[21:07.340 --> 21:13.820]  thing. And my friend and I were writing like a Star Wars pun based thing for the class.
[21:14.060 --> 21:17.960]  And we're calling stuff like instead of lightsaber, they were life savers,
[21:18.380 --> 21:22.800]  like it was a candy sword. And that was the funniest shit ever, even though it's not funny at
[21:22.800 --> 21:28.640]  all. And just could not stop no matter what is getting in trouble and like trying to you
[21:28.640 --> 21:34.780]  desperately want to stop laughing, but you just can't. You're just stuck. Do you remember the
[21:35.680 --> 21:42.980]  most or like the hardest you've ever laughed in your entire life? No. Oh, I wish I could.
[21:43.680 --> 21:48.300]  I think once again, I think I told this before on the show, but there is when I went to save
[21:48.300 --> 21:52.900]  my friend Brandon in PUBG and I accidentally ran him over with the car. I laughed so hard,
[21:52.960 --> 22:00.340]  I almost fainted. That's that's rare. That's a rare time there. There was a moment in a
[22:00.340 --> 22:05.860]  let's play we were doing years ago where a Jeep came in to save it, save us, and it ran over Jack.
[22:05.920 --> 22:10.040]  And I remember I remember laughing for like a week straight after that.
[22:12.360 --> 22:17.560]  But he was great in that regard. That just popped in my head. That's that's not the moment. But man,
[22:17.560 --> 22:22.800]  what was the moment? Do you have one? I don't know. I'm like the only thing that comes to mind
[22:22.800 --> 22:28.740]  is actually it's a Gavin moment. But the night that Gavin and I and it's the night it is the
[22:28.740 --> 22:31.920]  night that Gavin tried to fuck me, but that's not what this is about. Come on. It's the night
[22:31.920 --> 22:38.560]  that that's what you said that night when I said no, it's it's the night we watched. For some reason,
[22:38.560 --> 22:43.540]  we watched Tommy Boy together and that that night I was like the 20th time I'd seen it. But I don't
[22:43.540 --> 22:47.420]  think I've ever laughed as hard as as watching Tommy Boy with you that night. Something about
[22:47.420 --> 22:51.360]  just the right night and the right. Yeah, the right environment, the right people. It was like a party
[22:51.360 --> 22:56.740]  was happening behind us. It was the kind of laughter where like Geoff's lent back on the couch and his
[22:56.740 --> 23:04.360]  legs are kicking it like 50 times and the whole couch is like... Home Alone. Anytime if I if I
[23:04.360 --> 23:07.300]  go a good six months without seeing Home Alone, it's like watching it for the first time.
[23:08.420 --> 23:13.320]  That gets me. I would honestly say Andrew's story about his ankles had me up maybe in a
[23:13.320 --> 23:21.600]  top 10 laugh. I'm glad my pain can bring you such joy. Yeah, and it wasn't even a live pain. It was
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.920]  just a retelling of your pain. Yeah. Recapping pain. If I watched you do it, I wouldn't have
[23:26.920 --> 23:32.200]  laughed at all. You you told me a story one time about walking through the woods and some guys
[23:32.200 --> 23:36.160]  bullying you and taking your jacket. And I remember this wasn't on content or anything. And I just
[23:36.160 --> 23:40.660]  remember laughing my ass off in that story the way you told it being very, very funny. Do you
[23:40.660 --> 23:46.120]  remember that? I don't remember that. What I immediately think of with Woods was I my I had a
[23:46.120 --> 23:52.660]  friend who had an airsoft birthday party. And so we met this guy and then he drove us into the woods
[23:52.660 --> 23:59.340]  and he played for some reason. It was very odd. But my mom was worried I'd get hurt. So she put
[23:59.340 --> 24:05.580]  me in the biggest like sweater that I had. But it was like a rainbow sweater. So it just resulted
[24:05.580 --> 24:11.820]  in me getting pelted by by bullets or the pellets because I were in the woods. Everything's green
[24:11.820 --> 24:17.240]  and I'm wearing like a bright red and orange and yellow like I was the most shoot me thing.
[24:17.680 --> 24:24.120]  Yeah. Giant shoot me sweater. And I just got destroyed because of it. It was the reverse
[24:24.120 --> 24:30.900]  of camo, as Eric just said. I was not a fun time. I'm trying to think of any other good pain.
[24:30.900 --> 24:37.100]  I mean, I fell in that box recently at first. I still I don't I should just get rid of that basket
[24:37.100 --> 24:41.780]  that I have in my bathroom because I don't use it. And all I've used it for is stepping in it
[24:41.780 --> 24:47.820]  accidentally and then going head first into it. It's really brought me zero joy.
[24:49.900 --> 24:54.440]  I know it's probably not like the funniest moment probably wouldn't be during content,
[24:54.500 --> 24:58.240]  but for some reason, that's what pops up the most. The time that Gavin and I were doing a
[24:58.240 --> 25:04.300]  Let's Play in MLB, like that 2K baseball game. And he referred to the batter's box as a staple.
[25:04.960 --> 25:10.120]  And for some reason that made I shit my pants. I laughed so hard in that moment. I had to run to
[25:10.120 --> 25:13.620]  the bathroom and clean up. And so we could finish the video. You were drinking back then, though.
[25:13.760 --> 25:18.260]  It was a lot easier to get you to shit your pants. That might be the only time I've laughed
[25:18.260 --> 25:24.660]  so hard. I literally shit my pants. Yeah. That was our that was our first Let's Play
[25:24.660 --> 25:29.520]  together after I came back. Was it really? Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Wow. Probably the first
[25:29.520 --> 25:38.640]  one since the jump shot in Left 4 Dead. Jesus. That was the first real Let's Play we ever did,
[25:38.700 --> 25:42.060]  maybe. Yeah. I decided I wanted to make Achievement Guides, but record the commentary
[25:42.060 --> 25:47.100]  live as we were trying to get him. Just turned into Let's Plays, really. Oh, wow. I mean,
[25:47.180 --> 25:51.880]  yeah, it's essentially that. That was great. I'm still missing one achievement, I think,
[25:51.880 --> 25:57.340]  the original Left 4 Dead. Oh, which one? I think it was one of the DLC ones, I want to say.
[25:57.900 --> 26:01.220]  God, do you remember that night you and I tried to clean up DLC achievements? Yeah,
[26:01.340 --> 26:04.220]  I think so. Bad at Left 4 Dead. We said we'd never talk about it.
[26:04.900 --> 26:08.680]  And I remember because you were playing with Andrew and I wasn't either. I wasn't a part of it
[26:08.680 --> 26:13.880]  or I was watching, but you stopped. You put down the controller, took off your headset at the end
[26:13.880 --> 26:21.120]  of that, and you were like, I think Andrew's lost it. I think I did. It's gone. The magic was gone.
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.800]  It was a bad night. We, I would love, I think we got to have discs, right? That's the only hold up,
[26:25.880 --> 26:32.760]  but I would love, love for us to do Let's Plays in Left 4 Dead. Well, you found a whole bundle of
[26:32.760 --> 26:37.120]  discs, so we should have them. I'll have to see if there's any in there, yeah. Yeah, you took a big
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.560]  spindle. Oh, yeah. It's crazy to me you didn't look through that. Like, I would, I just, I would
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.750]  have to check if I were you. I'd be so excited. Oh, you just grabbed it? Yeah, it was just my old,
[26:47.750 --> 26:54.050]  it was my old stuff. Yeah, but I don't know, I guess for me, if I, here's a copy of Amped 3.
[26:55.710 --> 27:01.230]  The Simpsons game, Kane and Lynch, Top Spin, Madden 06. Are you looking through it right now?
[27:01.590 --> 27:05.790]  Yeah. Connect Adventures, Superman Returns. The Simpsons game is worth a lot of money now.
[27:05.990 --> 27:10.830]  Wow. Red Dead Redemption. Red Dead Redemption. I don't, I'm not seeing any Left 4 Dead. Oh,
[27:10.930 --> 27:16.970]  a Quake, multiple copies of Quake 4. Hell yeah. We just played that. Oh, Eric, you'll love this.
[27:16.970 --> 27:23.390]  I have a copy of Smackdown vs. Raw 2007. That game sucks.
[27:25.790 --> 27:33.270]  Get ready to do Let's Plays in it. Here's my copy of Open Season. Nice. This podcast has turned into
[27:33.270 --> 27:39.690]  Geoff saying names of things and Nick going, ooh, I'm captivated. I'm waiting for Left 4 Dead. I'm
[27:39.690 --> 27:43.630]  not going to say any more names. I'll just, I'll just say it if, if it shows up. You announced it
[27:43.630 --> 27:48.370]  Double Agent. That's a great game. I love Double Agent. That's probably my favorite Splinter Cell.
[27:49.050 --> 27:55.870]  Gavin, what's your favorite Splinter Cell? Uh, probably, I mean, Double Agent had really good
[27:55.870 --> 28:01.350]  multiplayer. Maybe the third one, Chaos Theory. Chaos Theory is good too. I have a new product
[28:01.350 --> 28:07.510]  idea that I'm really happy with, but, uh, I don't know how we do it. We don't really have a Tony
[28:07.510 --> 28:12.470]  in our lives anymore. Sadly, this would be a classic Tony product, but I was thinking about
[28:12.470 --> 28:16.790]  what would be something, you know, in the same vein of we did the, the clogged tube.
[28:17.310 --> 28:22.730]  What is like a product anyone could use or that like has a, has a purpose, a real purpose.
[28:23.090 --> 28:28.790]  And I thought toothbrushes, regulation toothbrush. And that was my first thought. And I thought,
[28:28.870 --> 28:33.710]  what if we put a grown tube in a toothbrush? I think that would work really well because you
[28:33.710 --> 28:39.170]  got the swivel motion, the left and right. Like, I think it would actually function.
[28:39.170 --> 28:44.090]  Allow me to modify this a little bit when you're done. Of course. No, I want to hear
[28:44.090 --> 28:49.250]  the modification now. I've always thought about what's the problem with a toothbrush, right?
[28:49.930 --> 28:54.830]  At the end of the day, what's the problem? You, you gotta, you, you brush your lower teeth.
[28:55.090 --> 29:00.730]  Then you got to flip the toothbrush to brush your upper teeth. You're doing the work twice.
[29:01.130 --> 29:05.390]  Why don't we invent a toothbrush that has the bristles on the bottom and the top? So you're
[29:05.390 --> 29:11.550]  brushing both sets of teeth at the same time. I like that. Like a double, double, a double edged.
[29:11.630 --> 29:19.990]  Yeah. Like a, like a great sword for toothbrushes. Now is it front and back or top and bottom?
[29:20.550 --> 29:24.250]  Oh, you know, it'd be even better as if it was like a toilet plunger and it was just all bristles.
[29:28.150 --> 29:34.670]  That's Eric is posting photos. Once again, this shit exists. That one is for both sides of the
[29:34.670 --> 29:42.830]  teeth at the same time. Nick said, oops, all bristles. What are the names of these toothbrushes,
[29:42.870 --> 29:48.950]  Eric? If I want a double side, what is that called? The last one that I just sent is called the Nano
[29:48.950 --> 29:55.910]  360 three-sided toothbrush. So you're getting, you're getting the front, the back and the top on
[29:55.910 --> 30:01.670]  a, on a brush, but it's not quite what Geoff is talking about where it's both sides. It's also
[30:01.670 --> 30:08.310]  not 360 degrees. I agree with you. Otherwise I'll be brushing the underneath of your teeth roots.
[30:08.910 --> 30:16.590]  The first one is in Arthur Colpare proposed double-sided toothbrush that saves time.
[30:16.970 --> 30:22.490]  Most double-sided toothbrushes that you find are really only focusing on the front and backs of
[30:22.490 --> 30:28.750]  teeth and not the like top and bottom at the same time, which I guess makes sense. Like if you like
[30:28.750 --> 30:36.030]  really think about it. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking. Damn Oral-B. Oral-B. Well, there's
[30:36.030 --> 30:41.630]  no way Oral-B has put a grown tube in a toothbrush. So you still got that. That's true. That's true.
[30:41.810 --> 30:46.550]  The problem would be chunky, right? That'd be a thick toothbrush. Yeah. Couldn't you take the
[30:46.550 --> 30:52.170]  key chain one that we had in like tape it on there and like give it a shot? Yes, I could as a
[30:52.170 --> 30:56.310]  prototype. I like that idea a lot. Yeah, yeah. You can prototype that for just record the sound while
[30:56.310 --> 31:01.010]  you brush your teeth so we can hear how it sounds. I will. While you're doing that, you should invent a
[31:01.010 --> 31:05.530]  grown pencil too, so that every time you make a mistake and you flip it up to erase it, you get a grown.
[31:06.510 --> 31:13.070]  Just goes, oops. That's a fucking great idea. Now you can hear, now there's an audible sound every time you
[31:13.070 --> 31:20.730]  fuck up. As long as I don't have to eat it, I'm on board. I like this idea a lot. That'd be your
[31:20.730 --> 31:29.170]  redemption. Yeah. Have you ever thought about becoming friends with a guy called Tony and a guy called Oscar
[31:31.130 --> 31:35.270]  and maybe like an Emily and trying to trying to get like a friendship egot?
[31:36.950 --> 31:40.850]  I know a Tony and Oscar and an Emily. I'm married to an Emily.
[31:41.290 --> 31:45.670]  I think finding someone called Grammy might be a bit difficult. Yeah, but what about a Gavin?
[31:47.630 --> 31:52.790]  Oh, what do you mean? Emily, Gavin, your name starts with G.
[31:54.430 --> 31:58.030]  I mean, do you guys don't understand what Gavin's saying?
[32:01.770 --> 32:08.270]  Gavin, I just want to say that you made perfect sense. You made perfect sense through the whole
[32:08.270 --> 32:12.610]  way. I'm just letting you know. Yeah, you made perfect sense and only one person got it and
[32:12.610 --> 32:18.450]  the rest of us didn't. Yeah, and explained it to us. Oh, shit. You and me, Eric. That's on them.
[32:18.570 --> 32:23.190]  I don't know why they're pointing fingers. It made sense when you said Tony and Oscar,
[32:23.770 --> 32:27.610]  like it all made sense. 100%. You think there are any listeners named Grammy?
[32:29.010 --> 32:33.710]  You think anyone who listens to this show is named Grammy? Does anyone have that nickname
[32:33.710 --> 32:36.910]  for their grandmother? That's exactly what it's going to be. People are going to go
[32:36.910 --> 32:44.130]  grandmother. Yeah, 100%. Oh, Nick. Nick says his mom is Grammy. Yeah. To my kid. Oh,
[32:45.090 --> 32:51.210]  can you introduce your mom to Gavin for this? You can only call her Grammy, though.
[32:53.370 --> 33:00.550]  I'm sure she'll love that. I'm sure he'll love that. Yeah. I have a game.
[33:01.730 --> 33:04.510]  Oh, sweet. I got a game, too. I'm going to do it next episode.
[33:05.090 --> 33:09.170]  Oh, you're going to do next episode? Let me get my game together. Hey, Eric, you got a game?
[33:09.810 --> 33:13.310]  No, man, I'm along for the ride on this one. I don't have a game either. I just want to play.
[33:13.590 --> 33:20.610]  This is a guessing game for you guys. As you know, my computer is a piece of shit and will freeze all
[33:20.610 --> 33:25.470]  the time. And there will be times where I'm going to search something and I'll put in all the
[33:25.470 --> 33:31.710]  characters correctly. It will freeze and then it will spit out all the things I put. But in a random
[33:31.710 --> 33:36.990]  sequence that you can't unless you know what it is, isn't going to necessarily make sense.
[33:37.130 --> 33:42.890]  So I'm going to put in a recent one I had and you have to tell me what was I trying to search?
[33:44.610 --> 33:52.030]  The letters are G.E.A.M. space N.F.T. space O.F.F.R. Some sort of great offer.
[33:53.990 --> 34:00.470]  So it's been scrambled. It is. Yes. Are all the letters present?
[34:02.090 --> 34:03.370]  Uh, no.
[34:06.050 --> 34:12.370]  Two of the words can be made. How many words was it? Three. Three words.
[34:13.250 --> 34:19.630]  I think the first word is team. It's either team or gleam.
[34:20.790 --> 34:27.390]  Gleam team? I don't think it's gleam team. It's not game. Game, N.F.T., O.F.F.R.
[34:28.110 --> 34:31.250]  No. Yeah, Andrew's big into N.F.T. Yeah, he's big into N.F.T.
[34:31.250 --> 34:35.330]  N.F.T. is right. That is part of the search. What? Oh.
[34:37.210 --> 34:39.410]  Greem? Mage?
[34:41.710 --> 34:43.170]  Magic N.F.T.
[34:46.410 --> 34:50.670]  Offsides. So I will say my next clue for the G.E.A.M.
[34:51.430 --> 34:56.850]  Uh, parts of the G.E.A.M. and parts of the offer are actually just the first word.
[34:57.930 --> 35:00.430]  Good. Off game.
[35:04.830 --> 35:13.030]  Offer N.F.T. Grammy. Are you going to offer N.F.T.s to Nick's mom? I'm not, unfortunately.
[35:13.450 --> 35:20.310]  The word I tried to search was Geoff Ramsey N.F.T. because I was thinking about when we did the ham
[35:20.310 --> 35:27.210]  sandwich back before we knew what N.F.T.s were and that it was bad. We had a ham sandwich
[35:27.210 --> 35:32.370]  N.F.T. Oh, yeah, I was Eric and I were talking about it of like, where even is that now?
[35:33.010 --> 35:39.230]  How much negative money is that worth? And I went to search it, and that is what came out
[35:39.230 --> 35:45.190]  when I typed in Geoff Ramsey N.F.T. Did you ever find the N.F.T.? No, I did not follow through
[35:45.190 --> 35:53.770]  on the search for the N.F.T. Why? Why does your computer do that? Because it's from 2009
[35:53.770 --> 36:01.250]  and it's an Apple. Maybe not that late. Let's see about this Mac. Can we track down the
[36:01.750 --> 36:06.790]  ham sandwich N.F.T.? If you're listening and you're the owner of the ham sandwich N.F.T.,
[36:06.790 --> 36:13.510]  please let us know how much regret you have. It's not for sale. They're not selling it.
[36:13.850 --> 36:19.770]  Oh, wow. I mean, like they could if they wanted to. I don't think that's the fucking word. It's
[36:19.770 --> 36:26.790]  the first ham sandwich. First N.F.T. ham sandwich ever. It's a one of one. It's clearly first and
[36:26.790 --> 36:33.390]  only. Yeah. What other searches have you got? That's that's the only one I got for now. I'm
[36:33.390 --> 36:38.730]  going to update it as it goes. It is a short game, but it happens often. There's a picture
[36:38.730 --> 36:44.630]  of me eating the ham sandwich. Mustard on the outside is weird. I didn't like that part of it.
[36:45.550 --> 36:49.910]  I didn't really like any of it. It was a good ham sandwich.
[36:53.170 --> 37:00.870]  Sort of in relation to that of me misunderstanding things, I watched the New Zealand version of the
[37:00.870 --> 37:05.590]  traders recently. I've been getting into the traders. Oh, don't don't spoil it. I'm only halfway
[37:05.590 --> 37:11.830]  through. I'm not going to spoil anything for you. But I had I had a moment where I misinterpreted
[37:11.830 --> 37:19.210]  something completely where they were they were doing in it. You know how like in those reality
[37:19.210 --> 37:23.290]  shows, they knew interviews of the people and they react to stuff like a reality TV works.
[37:24.210 --> 37:31.970]  And one of them said, mum's day. And I thought, oh, is that like a New Zealand slang sentence?
[37:31.970 --> 37:39.470]  Is that like a like a excitement or like, does that mean like, whoa, type thing? And it turns
[37:39.470 --> 37:47.790]  out it's not. The woman was just saying mum's day in reference to the fact that they were mums.
[37:48.130 --> 37:55.690]  They were mums. Oh, yeah. Mum's day. Mum's day. Yeah. But I thought it was I thought it was one
[37:55.690 --> 38:02.850]  thing. I thought it was mum's day, like a saying. So that has become a thing with my partner and I.
[38:03.050 --> 38:08.990]  Mum's day is like now a slang word. But I was convinced I thought it was like a crazy New
[38:08.990 --> 38:15.690]  Zealand thing and. I was wrong, I felt really dumb. England had a show called The Crystal Maze
[38:16.150 --> 38:22.070]  hosted by Richard O'Brien from. Rocky Horror, and he would always say mum's day,
[38:22.470 --> 38:27.230]  but it was because that's what he called his mum and he was in the maze as well.
[38:28.550 --> 38:34.710]  The mum was in the maze? I've heard mum's day as a mum before. Mum's day? I've never heard that.
[38:34.710 --> 38:40.150]  Mum's day? Mum's day? It's like posh. Posh. Yeah. I hear it in a British accent. Yeah,
[38:40.190 --> 38:43.010]  it's like a little British, like a little British boy would say it
[38:43.010 --> 38:46.650]  or an adult pretending to be a little British boy. That's more like it.
[38:49.230 --> 38:53.330]  I've I've decided there's a new type of guy that I want to become.
[38:54.510 --> 39:01.090]  I want to become a gravy in a can guy. What is gravy in a can? Pot? What?
[39:01.630 --> 39:05.970]  Yeah. Caramelized onion gravy? I want to get into gravy, but from cans.
[39:06.950 --> 39:11.670]  What would you use that for? Meat? Drink it. Yeah, drink it.
[39:13.070 --> 39:17.290]  They'll pick me up in the middle of the day. Yeah, it would be fun to leave amongst a load
[39:17.290 --> 39:27.710]  of beers in a cooler. Pot. Now, have you used this? Is it good? No, I was too scared to buy it,
[39:27.710 --> 39:31.870]  but I think it would have built confidence. Let's go get it. How are you going to be one
[39:31.870 --> 39:36.950]  of those guys if you won't even buy it? Yeah, it was like it was like six bucks.
[39:38.070 --> 39:43.470]  That's British, right? Yeah, I was on the I was in where the world food. Yeah. Was it called
[39:43.470 --> 39:48.050]  World Market? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Nick, you want to you want to try gravy can? Absolutely. Let's do
[39:48.050 --> 39:54.390]  it. You guys should see who can chug a can of gravy first. Oh, God. Oh, no. I hate that.
[39:56.330 --> 40:01.010]  I don't know what I hate more, that or your piss fountain, your piss waterfall thing.
[40:01.250 --> 40:05.870]  Everybody loved the piss waterfall. There were zero issues. It was 100 percent positive.
[40:06.930 --> 40:10.750]  Most people were like, don't give us a warning next time. We want to be surprised by it.
[40:11.570 --> 40:18.190]  Oh, is there really backlash in the first episode? Very minor. Wow. That's funny.
[40:18.650 --> 40:20.950]  Well, that's what the podcast is supposed to be. So
[40:22.090 --> 40:26.730]  do you want to hear a review for Potts caramelized onion gravy made with HP sauce?
[40:27.770 --> 40:33.490]  Has three stars, according to this person. I bought this product to use a mashed potatoes
[40:33.490 --> 40:37.050]  and sausages for dinner. I did not know what to expect from gravy in a beer can.
[40:37.350 --> 40:42.030]  I found the product to be decent, but it was more like a sweet curry rather than a gravy.
[40:43.250 --> 40:47.410]  Interesting. OK, so, Nick, we'll get some mash and some sausages. We'll cook them up,
[40:47.410 --> 40:50.490]  half a can each. Or do you want a full can each?
[40:51.990 --> 40:54.390]  Uh, that's full can. Yeah, boy.
[40:57.730 --> 41:01.850]  I mean, had an out and just went full can. I love it.
[41:02.470 --> 41:04.030]  Should we do this? Should we all do it?
[41:04.570 --> 41:04.890]  Yes.
[41:05.010 --> 41:06.430]  No, no.
[41:07.090 --> 41:10.190]  So, Eric, you're saying that if we all got together and Nick and I did the gravy
[41:10.670 --> 41:12.250]  from a can, you would just say no thing?
[41:12.350 --> 41:14.190]  I mean, I would be excited to watch it. Yeah.
[41:14.190 --> 41:18.830]  Yeah, I mean, we'd cheer you on, but this definitely feels like a Gavin and Nick specific
[41:18.830 --> 41:21.670]  thing. Yeah, the two British guys.
[41:22.030 --> 41:28.170]  To be honest with you, if Eric and I participated, I think it would lessen the whole thing.
[41:28.390 --> 41:32.490]  I disagree. I'm going to vote on it. Should Eric drink the can of gravy? I vote yes.
[41:32.570 --> 41:33.690]  Yes. I vote yes.
[41:35.690 --> 41:38.230]  Andrew, it was a solid no when it was him.
[41:38.430 --> 41:42.510]  All right, well, should Eric drink the gravy? I guess I'm a yes as well.
[41:43.150 --> 41:45.430]  Yes, I love democracy.
[41:49.170 --> 41:51.170]  It's too bad our country doesn't.
[41:53.810 --> 41:54.990]  Let's do it again.
[41:55.710 --> 42:00.470]  It's like this weird strong-armed democracy where no one actually has a say.
[42:00.790 --> 42:04.590]  It's just bullying. It's great. It's so funny.
[42:04.890 --> 42:06.770]  I think we've completely misunderstood the concept.
[42:06.990 --> 42:10.350]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Oh, my God. Wow.
[42:10.350 --> 42:14.150]  Well, we got to get together and do stuff soon anyway, right? There's got to be something.
[42:14.930 --> 42:19.670]  Yeah, I think the problem with democracy and the way we've done it is that you're all for it unless
[42:19.670 --> 42:23.610]  it's about you, in which case you can be more against it.
[42:23.650 --> 42:25.310]  Well, I think that's democracy in general.
[42:25.650 --> 42:28.610]  I'm not really sure why you're presenting this like,
[42:28.770 --> 42:33.330]  I think maybe this is my hypothesis when you were a no and then you just voted yes.
[42:33.550 --> 42:38.150]  Like, that's clearly what happened. It's not a hypothesis. You just showed it in action.
[42:38.150 --> 42:41.730]  I had to rephrase the vote because if I said, should we all try it, I would have been out.
[42:42.030 --> 42:44.210]  Yeah, absolutely. A hundred percent. Yeah.
[42:44.930 --> 42:48.150]  I'm just acknowledging that. I thought that was a lot of fun to vote yes.
[42:48.270 --> 42:50.790]  But if that was flipped, I would not have had a fun time.
[42:50.910 --> 42:52.250]  And I know the vote would have been yes.
[42:53.610 --> 42:55.270]  The question is, what gravy do you go with?
[42:55.290 --> 42:57.450]  Because they have multiple lines of gravy in a can.
[42:57.910 --> 42:59.990]  Oh, so caramelized onions is like one flavor?
[43:00.310 --> 43:02.990]  That is one flavor of pots, gravy cans.
[43:03.270 --> 43:06.210]  Well, let's get all the flavors and we'll do a blind bag.
[43:06.350 --> 43:08.130]  We'll reach in. It'll be like a potluck.
[43:08.890 --> 43:10.330]  I love it. Let's do it.
[43:10.750 --> 43:14.150]  I've been wanting to do a blind taste test for a while with something.
[43:14.990 --> 43:17.010]  I was thinking it'd be fun to get all those.
[43:17.190 --> 43:19.650]  Remember a while back, I don't think it made it into an episode.
[43:19.890 --> 43:26.330]  Maybe it did, but I showed you guys a bunch of just like weird ass sodas that I found at the Fiesta.
[43:26.390 --> 43:27.710]  Yes. Yeah.
[43:27.790 --> 43:30.870]  I want to buy a bunch of those and do some sort of a blind taste test.
[43:30.890 --> 43:32.630]  See if you could figure out what the fuck any of it is.
[43:32.810 --> 43:35.370]  Maybe we can do it with... maybe we can combine them.
[43:35.370 --> 43:38.810]  So are you... are you gonna drink the gravy also?
[43:39.570 --> 43:39.810]  Who?
[43:40.470 --> 43:40.770]  You.
[43:41.330 --> 43:42.510]  Well, I wasn't voted on, so no.
[43:43.530 --> 43:47.410]  Okay. I mean, but you want to do the blind taste test?
[43:47.710 --> 43:48.950]  With the sodas, not with the gravy.
[43:49.730 --> 43:51.010]  They kind of go hand in hand.
[43:51.170 --> 43:53.670]  Yeah. They kind of really go hand in hand.
[43:53.830 --> 43:54.790]  Should we have a vote?
[43:55.050 --> 43:57.470]  If you want to vote for it, then we can vote for it.
[43:57.630 --> 43:59.490]  But until we vote for it, I don't have to do it.
[43:59.510 --> 44:00.770]  Should Geoff drink the gravy?
[44:00.950 --> 44:01.530]  I vote no.
[44:02.350 --> 44:02.530]  Yeah.
[44:03.110 --> 44:03.230]  Yeah.
[44:04.030 --> 44:04.390]  Ah!
[44:05.310 --> 44:06.310]  So how many flavors are there?
[44:06.710 --> 44:08.310]  I mean, I just don't know why you said anything.
[44:08.790 --> 44:10.070]  There are three flavors.
[44:10.170 --> 44:13.310]  I'm gonna ram this fucking democracy down all your throats every chance I get.
[44:13.810 --> 44:18.070]  So yeah, maybe we should all just have a sip and we'll see the titles of each can.
[44:18.210 --> 44:19.450]  And we'll just have to guess which one we've got.
[44:19.650 --> 44:20.490]  I think that's great.
[44:20.530 --> 44:21.330]  Yeah, I love that.
[44:21.370 --> 44:22.070]  I think that's great.
[44:22.190 --> 44:22.970]  When do we do this? Tomorrow?
[44:24.010 --> 44:25.050]  Uh, yeah.
[44:25.130 --> 44:27.050]  We're already playing... we're playing Gears 5 tomorrow.
[44:27.430 --> 44:29.630]  Yeah, not available tomorrow, but next week.
[44:30.070 --> 44:30.290]  Okay.
[44:30.570 --> 44:31.230]  Okay, next week.
[44:31.790 --> 44:32.830]  We have a stream tomorrow.
[44:33.270 --> 44:34.910]  Oh, we do.
[44:35.270 --> 44:39.450]  So we stream on Fridays on Twitch, uh, at 2 p.m. Central, roughly.
[44:40.270 --> 44:41.370]  Uh, that'll come and go.
[44:41.490 --> 44:42.490]  Times will probably shift or whatever.
[44:43.010 --> 44:45.990]  Because I think I have Gracie available next Friday.
[44:46.170 --> 44:50.430]  And if we spring canned gravy taste test on Gracie, he'll do it.
[44:51.050 --> 44:52.310]  Dude, gravy Gracie?
[44:52.610 --> 44:52.910]  That's the...
[44:52.910 --> 44:53.950]  Gracie, Gracie!
[44:55.070 --> 44:55.830]  They'd be...
[44:55.830 --> 44:59.070]  She'd be like, they used to call me Gracie Gravy back in high school.
[45:01.790 --> 45:02.670]  I don't know why.
[45:02.830 --> 45:05.370]  I feel like that's a downgrade from British Shackle.
[45:05.410 --> 45:06.210]  Yeah, I think so.
[45:06.610 --> 45:08.630]  I... well, you had something to aspire to, right?
[45:08.690 --> 45:11.350]  You start as Gracie Gravy and you work your way up to British Shackle.
[45:13.390 --> 45:19.190]  I really like the idea of somehow having these mixed in with normal sodas and not knowing
[45:19.710 --> 45:21.070]  what you're gonna get until...
[45:21.990 --> 45:24.170]  Oh, it'd be like your... the Bov thing you did?
[45:24.590 --> 45:26.050]  Yeah, like Dodge the Bov.
[45:26.410 --> 45:26.630]  Yeah.
[45:26.990 --> 45:31.230]  So it's all the weird sodas and the gravy, and so you don't know what weird soda or...
[45:31.230 --> 45:32.910]  if it's weird soda or weird gravy.
[45:33.150 --> 45:33.350]  All right.
[45:33.490 --> 45:35.830]  Yeah, it's just all cans that look the same.
[45:35.970 --> 45:38.130]  Maybe you put koozies to cover... I don't know.
[45:38.330 --> 45:39.510]  You paint the can... I don't know.
[45:39.710 --> 45:41.670]  I wonder what else interesting comes in a can.
[45:41.810 --> 45:43.430]  You'd have some sort of crazy can roulette.
[45:43.930 --> 45:45.230]  I like that idea.
[45:45.450 --> 45:46.330]  What else can we get in cans?
[45:46.450 --> 45:47.070]  Here's what we should do.
[45:47.110 --> 45:52.550]  We should have a field trip to the international food market and just go fucking hog wild.
[45:53.290 --> 45:54.250]  I love that idea.
[45:54.950 --> 45:55.250]  What?
[45:56.410 --> 46:00.850]  Rank... you guys, rank which gravy you'd want to consume the most to the least in the can.
[46:00.850 --> 46:02.770]  I'll go through the flavors right now.
[46:02.770 --> 46:05.910]  You got caramelized onion gravy with HP sauce.
[46:07.130 --> 46:09.370]  Chicken gravy is flavor two.
[46:10.010 --> 46:12.070]  Flavor three is beef gravy.
[46:12.710 --> 46:14.530]  Oh, beef's going at the top for me.
[46:15.310 --> 46:17.110]  I mean, that's just Bovril, isn't it? Essentially.
[46:18.070 --> 46:19.070]  Oh, you might be right.
[46:20.110 --> 46:21.170]  Might be very similar.
[46:21.950 --> 46:23.430]  But I love a Bov.
[46:23.750 --> 46:24.590]  Are those the three?
[46:25.030 --> 46:25.850]  Those are three.
[46:25.930 --> 46:26.430]  Oh, that's it?
[46:26.690 --> 46:28.970]  Chicken gravy, caramelized onion gravy and beef.
[46:29.130 --> 46:29.570]  They're all good.
[46:29.570 --> 46:32.050]  I would do beef chicken caramelized, probably.
[46:32.770 --> 46:36.670]  Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what the British consider chicken gravy, though.
[46:36.990 --> 46:38.510]  I'd have to I'd have to see it.
[46:38.730 --> 46:44.950]  I don't want to drink anything out of a can that has onion on the label.
[46:45.210 --> 46:50.910]  The fact that it's caramelized really doesn't make it any better.
[46:51.230 --> 46:57.290]  What if I spent some time in a lab and I developed an onion based drink
[46:57.830 --> 47:00.770]  and I tried to get it to the point where you would enjoy it?
[47:01.170 --> 47:04.170]  I mean, it would have to be a very sweet onion.
[47:04.810 --> 47:05.390]  They exist.
[47:05.610 --> 47:06.670]  There are sweet onions, aren't there?
[47:06.730 --> 47:07.390]  Yeah, there are.
[47:07.430 --> 47:11.670]  But like I'm saying sweeter than sweeter than sweet.
[47:12.530 --> 47:15.310]  Well, I mean, the onion is just going to be a component of it, right?
[47:15.330 --> 47:17.450]  Like he can add other sweeteners.
[47:17.610 --> 47:18.830]  Oh, this onion aid.
[47:18.930 --> 47:19.650]  That's a real thing.
[47:20.010 --> 47:20.590]  Let's get it.
[47:21.950 --> 47:23.790]  I bet that's good.
[47:24.450 --> 47:26.730]  Wait, Gavin, you just.
[47:27.290 --> 47:30.290]  There is so much more that this brand.
[47:30.470 --> 47:33.810]  This brand is all about cans, pots.
[47:34.490 --> 47:36.690]  Oh, it's just like shit and cans.
[47:36.810 --> 47:37.550]  It is.
[47:37.690 --> 47:39.230]  That is their thing, it appears.
[47:39.550 --> 47:43.390]  I just posted a link for they have cooking sauces and cans.
[47:43.910 --> 47:44.550]  Wow.
[47:45.250 --> 47:47.790]  This is enchilada sauce?
[47:48.490 --> 47:48.530]  Insane.
[47:49.090 --> 47:50.270]  What the fuck?
[47:50.450 --> 47:51.430]  Katsu curry?
[47:52.050 --> 47:55.350]  Just one is just sweet and sour.
[47:55.670 --> 47:57.230]  I would drink the sweet and sour.
[47:57.230 --> 47:59.890]  Honestly, the sweet sour can looks delicious.
[48:00.070 --> 48:01.390]  That looks like a great drink.
[48:01.470 --> 48:03.270]  We've got to get every part.
[48:03.450 --> 48:05.750]  Their design is crazy.
[48:08.290 --> 48:11.050]  Nick said I'm going sauce monkey mode.
[48:15.670 --> 48:16.490]  This is.
[48:17.280 --> 48:18.090]  Look at.
[48:18.670 --> 48:19.810]  Fajita and taco.
[48:20.610 --> 48:22.890]  Dude, they have like liquid.
[48:22.970 --> 48:26.250]  They have like liquid death ass cans of stock.
[48:27.650 --> 48:28.090]  It's.
[48:30.970 --> 48:31.850]  Fish stock.
[48:33.690 --> 48:34.570]  Dessert sauces.
[48:34.770 --> 48:36.990]  Oh, God, it's that's horrific.
[48:37.170 --> 48:37.630]  I want to.
[48:37.630 --> 48:38.730]  I want to try every single one of these.
[48:42.250 --> 48:43.870]  Stocked cans and gravy cans.
[48:44.030 --> 48:47.450]  I want to find more weird canned stuff, but you can honestly
[48:47.450 --> 48:50.210]  do the roulette game with just pots products.
[48:50.630 --> 48:51.050]  There's enough.
[48:51.950 --> 48:55.090]  I'm trying to think of what would be the worst one to get.
[48:55.530 --> 48:56.490]  Fish stock.
[48:56.750 --> 48:58.170]  Fish stock has to be up there.
[48:58.250 --> 49:02.890]  Yeah, it has to be the kind of fish stock with locked in flavor.
[49:04.030 --> 49:06.230]  I think sweet and sour would be the easiest to consume.
[49:06.750 --> 49:10.310]  I think ragu would be a lot harder to drink than you think it would.
[49:10.470 --> 49:11.310]  I agree.
[49:12.030 --> 49:13.990]  It would just come out in glugs, right?
[49:14.230 --> 49:16.750]  Yeah, that's that's going to have to be a wide can hole.
[49:18.630 --> 49:19.410]  Veal stock.
[49:20.170 --> 49:24.970]  Can we do can we do a hidden camera thing with someone where we make spaghetti?
[49:25.090 --> 49:28.990]  And then go to pour the ragu sauce on and you just crack open a can.
[49:29.310 --> 49:31.470]  You crack a can and then pour it over it.
[49:31.630 --> 49:35.050]  I just want to see someone's reaction to that happening live.
[49:36.070 --> 49:36.970]  Oh, man.
[49:37.410 --> 49:38.630]  It would be so disturbing.
[49:39.450 --> 49:40.590]  This is just crazy.
[49:40.930 --> 49:42.690]  Gavin, you found a great brand.
[49:43.210 --> 49:45.050]  Yeah, I think we got to get Gracie on the cans.
[49:45.710 --> 49:47.450]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:48.610 --> 49:50.130]  Stuff in cans.
[49:50.270 --> 49:51.430]  So they had this shit locally.
[49:51.470 --> 49:53.150]  We can get potentially other sauces.
[49:53.670 --> 49:57.310]  Well, I only found the gravy, but yeah, I can go back and have a look.
[49:57.350 --> 49:58.870]  I mean, you can buy them from this website.
[49:59.550 --> 50:02.170]  When you go back, see if you can pick up an onionade as well.
[50:02.290 --> 50:03.630]  I was reading it. It sounds pretty good.
[50:04.150 --> 50:11.130]  It's an onion that scientists in Japan created to get rid of all the
[50:12.230 --> 50:13.970]  parts that make you cry and that are bitter.
[50:14.170 --> 50:15.230]  And it's just sweet.
[50:15.370 --> 50:19.230]  And then to show how sweet it is, they created onionade to try to convince people to buy it.
[50:19.670 --> 50:19.990]  Onionade.
[50:22.090 --> 50:22.730]  Oh, man.
[50:23.650 --> 50:27.470]  This has been this is our second episode ever for the show.
[50:27.830 --> 50:29.050]  Real, real weird one.
[50:29.370 --> 50:32.910]  Real one that one that I think people are going to call back to for like a long time.
[50:33.070 --> 50:35.710]  I think it's weird that you said it was our second episode ever.
[50:36.030 --> 50:37.070]  Yeah, this is our second episode ever.
[50:37.450 --> 50:38.910]  It started, I put episode two.
[50:38.990 --> 50:39.930]  This is our second episode ever.
[50:40.170 --> 50:41.430]  But you're like real weird one.
[50:41.550 --> 50:44.250]  If you're adhering to that logic, we've only done two.
[50:44.470 --> 50:44.730]  I don't know.
[50:44.730 --> 50:45.090]  Exactly.
[50:45.230 --> 50:46.210]  It's a real weird one, dude.
[50:46.250 --> 50:46.630]  That much.
[50:46.870 --> 50:48.670]  Yeah, half of these episodes have been fucking crazy.
[50:50.450 --> 50:51.710]  What is this?
[50:52.510 --> 50:56.670]  We talked about we talked about time traveling to kill horses last episode.
[50:56.910 --> 50:58.530]  Yeah, but none of that was practical.
[50:58.950 --> 50:59.510]  None of it was.
[50:59.610 --> 51:00.770]  This has all been practical.
[51:00.930 --> 51:06.410]  This is like having a friendship EGOT and strong arm democracy and fish stock in a can.
[51:06.550 --> 51:08.910]  Like this all seems like this is all stuff that we can.
[51:14.390 --> 51:15.550]  Look at this.
[51:16.630 --> 51:20.470]  Purple stuff, classic, great pro relaxation formula.
[51:20.550 --> 51:21.450]  What the hell is that name?
[51:21.450 --> 51:22.030]  Good Lord.
[51:22.470 --> 51:23.030]  Calm down.
[51:23.210 --> 51:23.410]  Relax.
[51:23.550 --> 51:25.230]  Is that like CBD juice?
[51:25.710 --> 51:26.570]  Yeah, it's got to be.
[51:26.690 --> 51:28.830]  What the fuck does super liminal mean?
[51:30.270 --> 51:31.750]  Oh my God.
[51:32.970 --> 51:33.530]  Liminal.
[51:33.910 --> 51:37.950]  Like we're going subliminal with some stuff, but other stuff we're going fucking super like
[51:37.950 --> 51:38.790]  hyper liminal.
[51:39.270 --> 51:40.950]  I think we're in our can era.
[51:41.270 --> 51:46.570]  The maximum threshold of great flavor that the human mind can grasp.
[51:46.850 --> 51:47.710]  Oh my God.
[51:47.710 --> 51:50.270]  It's a drink that is celestial rather than earthly.
[51:50.730 --> 51:52.250]  I got to say unpopular opinion.
[51:52.430 --> 51:53.610]  I cut the great flavor.
[51:53.810 --> 51:55.690]  It tastes like rancid shit.
[51:55.750 --> 51:59.210]  I hate whatever that fake grape is.
[52:01.070 --> 52:01.890]  I love it.
[52:02.290 --> 52:03.650]  Do you really love it?
[52:03.710 --> 52:03.890]  Love it.
[52:03.930 --> 52:04.110]  Love it.
[52:04.110 --> 52:04.330]  Love it.
[52:04.370 --> 52:04.470]  Love it.
[52:04.470 --> 52:04.650]  Love it.
[52:05.550 --> 52:06.530]  Did you have it as a kid?
[52:10.470 --> 52:14.810]  Grape cola, grapes, grapes, grape Kool-Aid, grape soda, grape, grape, grape.
[52:15.170 --> 52:17.150]  Everyone looks at me like I'm crazy when I say it.
[52:17.370 --> 52:19.490]  Maybe I just didn't because I didn't grow up with that.
[52:19.490 --> 52:19.870]  Maybe.
[52:20.830 --> 52:23.870]  Before Geoff says grape, somebody take that audio and throw it over
[52:23.870 --> 52:26.390]  when he drinks the fish sauce, whatever.
[52:28.610 --> 52:31.230]  The fish sauce is going to be rough.
[52:31.750 --> 52:32.330]  That's all.
[52:32.490 --> 52:33.150]  I don't like fish.
[52:34.030 --> 52:35.150]  Oh man.
[52:35.490 --> 52:36.270]  I don't like fish sauce.
[52:36.470 --> 52:38.610]  How do you get stock from the creature?
[52:41.230 --> 52:42.870]  It's bones, right?
[52:42.990 --> 52:44.210]  The use of the word creature is great.
[52:44.350 --> 52:45.050]  That's so good.
[52:45.650 --> 52:47.850]  Isn't stock just heated bone?
[52:47.850 --> 52:51.370]  So they just like take a bunch of fish bones and like melt it all down?
[52:51.770 --> 52:53.010]  I think so.
[52:53.410 --> 52:58.710]  They, you stew it, like you put it in with like water and stuff and you let it simmer and reduce.
[52:59.010 --> 53:03.010]  So that way it's taking on the flavor from bones and other pieces and parts.
[53:03.530 --> 53:07.130]  And then you strain it, get rid of everything that's like,
[53:07.150 --> 53:09.570]  it, you know, inedible or whatever.
[53:09.850 --> 53:14.610]  And then, uh, you, what you have left is a flavored broth.
[53:14.770 --> 53:16.830]  They don't call it like fish aid or chicken aid.
[53:16.830 --> 53:19.230]  No, they don't call it chicken aid.
[53:19.390 --> 53:19.710]  No.
[53:20.350 --> 53:24.410]  Here's a, it says, uh, fish sauce is produced by blending whole oily fish,
[53:24.490 --> 53:28.490]  such as anchovies or mackerel with the correct proportion of salt water and spices,
[53:28.490 --> 53:32.330]  and then fermented for a period from one to 12 months before filtered.
[53:32.730 --> 53:34.830]  The end result is a clear light brown liquid
[53:34.830 --> 53:37.910]  with a far more delicate flavor than the store-bought version.
[53:38.130 --> 53:39.070]  Oh, that's if you make it at home.
[53:40.310 --> 53:43.950]  You just have like a jar of fish in your fridge for a year?
[53:44.530 --> 53:44.770]  Yeah.
[53:45.570 --> 53:46.630]  I'm gooey fish.
[53:46.850 --> 53:48.970]  That's what the image from the article is. Here you go.
[53:49.490 --> 53:50.930]  Wow. That looks horrific.
[53:51.050 --> 53:51.230]  Ew.
[53:52.330 --> 53:53.450]  I hate this.
[53:53.670 --> 53:56.870]  We're all fucking drinking it next week. So.
[53:59.290 --> 54:01.410]  I fucking hate fish. That's so gross.
[54:01.490 --> 54:02.830]  I need to borrow your credit card, Geoff.
[54:03.730 --> 54:10.330]  I think the most disgusting thing that I like is just like tuna from a can or like sardines
[54:10.330 --> 54:11.030]  on toast.
[54:11.190 --> 54:11.530]  Like Nick?
[54:11.650 --> 54:12.870]  Just love that for some reason.
[54:12.870 --> 54:17.130]  Do you have anything that you like, but is so gross you recognize it's gross,
[54:17.270 --> 54:19.410]  so you don't allow yourself to eat it anymore?
[54:20.730 --> 54:22.570]  I would have put bovril in that list.
[54:23.090 --> 54:28.390]  Yeah. For me, it's spam. I grew up eating spam and I cannot allow myself to eat it as an adult.
[54:28.650 --> 54:29.010]  I get that.
[54:29.390 --> 54:33.150]  I have some stuff that is, I know is gross to Americans, but it's perfectly normal to
[54:33.690 --> 54:36.950]  the British. Like beans on toast, baked beans on toast. Love it.
[54:37.370 --> 54:37.830]  Totally fine.
[54:38.330 --> 54:39.630]  Nobody would have an issue with that in America.
[54:40.230 --> 54:40.490]  You sure?
[54:40.770 --> 54:41.690]  I don't know about that.
[54:41.690 --> 54:45.930]  I mean, it's weird to you though, because wouldn't it wet the bread down?
[54:46.310 --> 54:46.610]  Oh, yeah.
[54:47.070 --> 54:49.510]  Yeah. I mean, I've got to tackle it quickly.
[54:49.730 --> 54:52.250]  I'm not going to be walking away from it and eating it five minutes later.
[54:52.670 --> 54:52.930]  Okay.
[54:53.510 --> 54:58.070]  But that's how I am with cereal. I really have to concentrate and get it all down.
[54:58.450 --> 54:59.850]  That's how I am with mozzarella sticks.
[55:00.350 --> 55:00.450]  Yeah.
[55:00.530 --> 55:00.830]  Oh, really?
[55:01.590 --> 55:04.250]  Yeah, but after they start to cool down, they just go to shit.
[55:04.510 --> 55:05.830]  You got to eat them fucking immediately.
[55:07.730 --> 55:11.370]  Yeah. You've never seen anyone eat anything as fast as I eat your Weetabix.
[55:13.990 --> 55:19.730]  Because that thing, they got about 45 seconds until they start just falling apart on the spoon.
[55:22.230 --> 55:25.410]  Just real quick, before we wrap up, I want to circle back to this.
[55:26.070 --> 55:27.250]  I texted Gracie.
[55:28.310 --> 55:30.550]  Hey, would you drink gravy out of a can?
[55:31.490 --> 55:33.270]  Her reply, hell no.
[55:33.930 --> 55:35.970]  Why? Did Nick say he would?
[55:40.050 --> 55:41.230]  She knows me too well.
[55:43.330 --> 55:45.930]  I think anyone who knows you would assume that, Nick.
[55:45.950 --> 55:47.510]  That's true. Fair point.
[55:47.690 --> 55:49.490]  I think that's a surface level Nick thing.
[55:51.030 --> 55:52.870]  It's what people say when they see you.
[55:52.890 --> 55:55.650]  They go, I don't know much about that guy, but I know that's a guy that drinks gravy.
[55:56.190 --> 55:56.610]  Out of a can.
[55:57.190 --> 55:58.710]  We do have a good opportunity here.
[55:58.770 --> 56:01.050]  This fish thing has just given me an idea that we should all...
[56:02.250 --> 56:07.730]  We could potentially celebrate the one year anniversary of Regulation Podcast with some
[56:07.730 --> 56:08.290]  fermented...
[56:08.290 --> 56:09.630]  I don't want to wait that long.
[56:09.910 --> 56:10.290]  What do you mean?
[56:10.650 --> 56:11.990]  We're going to be doing it then anyway.
[56:12.110 --> 56:14.790]  How are you going to celebrate the one year anniversary before?
[56:15.030 --> 56:16.110]  You have to wait that long.
[56:16.210 --> 56:17.170]  That's when the one year anniversary is.
[56:17.190 --> 56:18.090]  What a ridiculous...
[56:18.970 --> 56:20.110]  So you want to be...
[56:20.110 --> 56:21.730]  I want to celebrate it now!
[56:22.310 --> 56:25.070]  We don't have a fun celebratory fermentation bit?
[56:25.470 --> 56:26.050]  You fool.
[56:26.470 --> 56:29.310]  I'm saying I don't want us to wait a year to drink the stuff.
[56:29.430 --> 56:31.890]  Not that I want us to accelerate the celebration.
[56:33.630 --> 56:35.970]  But you have to ferment fish sauce for a year.
[56:36.530 --> 56:37.730]  Yeah, but we can just buy it.
[56:37.790 --> 56:39.210]  We can just buy it in the can.
[56:39.690 --> 56:43.350]  I'm saying we could all ferment something different.
[56:43.390 --> 56:43.930]  Oh, I see.
[56:44.130 --> 56:44.550]  I got it.
[56:44.570 --> 56:45.610]  Okay, I understand now.
[56:45.670 --> 56:45.890]  Sorry.
[56:46.150 --> 56:48.010]  I was looking at exotic sodas.
[56:48.170 --> 56:48.550]  Here's the thing.
[56:48.870 --> 56:52.430]  I don't trust any of us to ferment anything and then drink it in a year.
[56:52.650 --> 56:54.530]  It just seems like it will lead to botulism.
[56:54.790 --> 56:55.250]  Oh, yeah.
[56:55.730 --> 56:58.450]  I got some fries fermenting on my my porch.
[56:58.730 --> 56:59.090]  Okay.
[56:59.450 --> 56:59.770]  It's eight months.
[57:00.230 --> 57:03.930]  Is there like a botulade pill we can take right before we try it tomorrow?
[57:04.950 --> 57:06.830]  Botulism is a thing that like kills you, kills you.
[57:06.910 --> 57:07.790]  So no, I'm not doing that.
[57:08.270 --> 57:08.970]  What did we all...
[57:08.970 --> 57:09.970]  So we're not going to do it.
[57:10.010 --> 57:11.570]  But if we did, what would we all ferment?
[57:13.850 --> 57:14.910]  Oh, hot sauce.
[57:15.690 --> 57:17.410]  Oh, that's a good one, Nick.
[57:19.030 --> 57:20.490]  Can you ferment anything?
[57:20.930 --> 57:21.550]  I assume so.
[57:21.770 --> 57:22.890]  How long does wine take?
[57:23.950 --> 57:25.450]  I mean, like a few months.
[57:25.850 --> 57:26.050]  Yeah.
[57:26.250 --> 57:28.110]  Oh, I mean like fruit wine and stuff.
[57:28.170 --> 57:30.330]  Like it takes longer if you want to do different stuff.
[57:32.310 --> 57:35.470]  Would any fruit you ferment turn into alcohol?
[57:36.530 --> 57:37.330]  I think so.
[57:37.330 --> 57:39.350]  I mean, depending on the sugars.
[57:39.930 --> 57:40.830]  Because I'd be fucked.
[57:41.010 --> 57:42.010]  I can't be getting drunk.
[57:43.890 --> 57:44.250]  Beets.
[57:44.330 --> 57:45.170]  I'm going to ferment beets.
[57:45.270 --> 57:45.710]  I bet they won't.
[57:46.170 --> 57:46.850]  Beets is a good one.
[57:47.070 --> 57:50.310]  I think I would do like peppers and carrots.
[57:51.370 --> 57:51.850]  Like together.
[57:52.270 --> 57:55.610]  So that way you get like a spicy carrot kind of thing.
[57:55.830 --> 57:56.290]  I like that.
[57:57.130 --> 57:58.050]  How long does a pickle?
[57:58.870 --> 57:59.290]  How long?
[57:59.810 --> 58:01.450]  At least...
[58:01.450 --> 58:02.450]  I think it kind of depends, you know?
[58:02.470 --> 58:03.070]  Six months?
[58:04.410 --> 58:04.890]  Oh, wait.
[58:04.930 --> 58:06.670]  How long was Seth Rogen in the thing?
[58:07.890 --> 58:09.730]  It was like 200 years or something.
[58:10.150 --> 58:10.650]  I think so.
[58:11.690 --> 58:16.970]  I'm going to ferment a pack of Kool-Aid gummies.
[58:17.850 --> 58:19.130]  Oh my god.
[58:19.830 --> 58:20.370]  Dank Mart.
[58:21.430 --> 58:24.350]  I googled weird sodas and I'm exploring...
[58:24.350 --> 58:24.550]  Yo, what's up?
[58:24.630 --> 58:25.770]  You guys going to Dank Mart later?
[58:25.770 --> 58:27.290]  Do you often shop at Dank Mart?
[58:27.790 --> 58:31.290]  I've never shopped before, but they've got my interest.
[58:31.430 --> 58:32.570]  If you say so, man.
[58:32.650 --> 58:33.230]  I don't know who might...
[58:33.230 --> 58:34.190]  Dankmart.ca.
[58:34.330 --> 58:35.850]  So it's a Canadian mart.
[58:37.910 --> 58:41.710]  We should wrap this one up because we have another one to do.
[58:42.710 --> 58:44.790]  But this was a great one.
[58:45.710 --> 58:48.090]  You can make a pickle in about three weeks.
[58:48.290 --> 58:49.450]  Maybe we should have a pickle-off.
[58:51.570 --> 58:52.890]  Everybody make their own pickles.
[58:53.030 --> 58:54.050]  See if you can make the best pickle.
[58:54.350 --> 58:56.710]  Again, I don't trust any of our fermentation.
[58:57.050 --> 58:58.710]  Like, I'm not doing anything that's fermenting.
[58:58.870 --> 58:59.290]  I was pretty clear about that.
[58:59.290 --> 59:00.110]  We could do some research.
[59:02.010 --> 59:04.030]  It's not that I don't think we couldn't learn.
[59:04.110 --> 59:07.310]  It's that I don't trust us to fucking nail it the first time.
[59:07.310 --> 59:08.990]  And it's botulism.
[59:09.170 --> 59:11.590]  I think Gus pickled and he didn't get botulism.
[59:12.410 --> 59:15.530]  I think there was one he threw out for fear of botulism.
[59:15.630 --> 59:16.290]  Think that could happen.
[59:18.170 --> 59:19.470]  Jesus Christ, wrap this up.
[59:21.210 --> 59:23.290]  Tell people where to subscribe to us and everything.
[59:23.650 --> 59:23.970]  That's what I'm saying.
[59:26.050 --> 59:27.050]  I'm sorry, Gavin, go ahead.
[59:27.230 --> 59:30.550]  Well, I was just saying, I think we're in a much better position than we were in last week.
[59:30.950 --> 59:34.190]  And thanks to all the crazy support after...
[59:34.190 --> 59:36.050]  Well, pre-episode one and post-episode one.
[59:36.550 --> 59:39.090]  I'm so excited about the stuff that we can now do.
[59:39.730 --> 59:40.910]  Like pickling things.
[59:40.990 --> 59:41.990]  Yeah, like pickling things.
[59:42.250 --> 59:43.070]  If Eric will let us.
[59:43.170 --> 59:44.830]  If democracy will allow us.
[59:45.150 --> 59:45.950]  You can do it.
[59:46.070 --> 59:48.250]  I'm not eating or partaking in it.
[59:48.370 --> 59:49.310]  That's all I'm saying.
[59:49.450 --> 59:50.490]  You can vote all you want.
[59:50.610 --> 59:51.610]  I stand firm on this.
[59:52.130 --> 59:53.890]  Can I test out the bleep?
[59:54.050 --> 59:54.710]  Firm like a pickle?
[59:55.550 --> 59:56.030]  You're gonna...
[59:56.030 --> 01:00:00.150]  Well, can we say to subscribe to us at patreon.com slash regulation podcast
[01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:03.730]  and listen to the podcast and check us out everywhere?
[01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:04.850]  And now you can test the bleep?
[01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.750]  Yeah.
[01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.430]  Is that you having said it all now?
[01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:09.510]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.870]  Okay.
[01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:12.130]  I'm gonna test the bleep.
[01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.470]  All right.
[01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:13.390]  See if we got it back.
[01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.830]  Okay.
[01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.510]  F***face.
