[00:00.000 --> 00:03.060]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.060 --> 00:03.900]  I'm sitting in the chair!
[00:04.600 --> 00:06.060]  I'm going down right now!
[00:06.440 --> 00:07.200]  I need to sit in the chair!
[00:07.620 --> 00:10.540]  Why? Why? You didn't do it at the end of the last episode.
[00:10.740 --> 00:11.440]  Why did you do that?
[00:11.440 --> 00:14.520]  Also, I gotta intro the fucking podcast first.
[00:14.640 --> 00:15.620]  I'm sitting in the chair. I don't care.
[00:16.100 --> 00:17.400]  You gotta... no, you can't...
[00:17.400 --> 00:20.100]  Let me get through the intro and I'll throw it to you.
[00:20.600 --> 00:23.340]  Let's do it properly. Let me throw it to you.
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.100]  All in favor of me sitting in the chair right now, say yes.
[00:25.100 --> 00:28.640]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:28.640 --> 00:32.680]  This is episode 0000003.
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.760]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Nick and Eric.
[00:36.940 --> 00:38.760]  Andrew, why don't you sit in that chair?
[00:39.020 --> 00:39.920]  I'm gonna sit in the chair!
[00:41.500 --> 00:44.320]  This is really nice. This is way better than what I was doing.
[00:44.600 --> 00:48.160]  My back has been so fucked because we've been recording everything today.
[00:48.400 --> 00:51.280]  This is our fourth recording, consecutively.
[00:52.060 --> 00:54.520]  My ass can't handle that in the other chair.
[00:54.780 --> 00:57.060]  I'm comfy. This is a great chair.
[00:57.060 --> 01:01.140]  To be honest, as soon as you sat down, I could hear your smile.
[01:01.620 --> 01:06.440]  Yeah, it's... he turned from a comedian to a comfy complainer, like instantly.
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.380]  I've been known to comfy complain, so I'm glad that it is bringing out that side of me.
[01:12.800 --> 01:13.660]  This is great.
[01:13.980 --> 01:15.940]  What are your immediate thoughts on the specifics?
[01:16.460 --> 01:19.360]  I can't believe I have a back now. That's wild.
[01:19.620 --> 01:22.180]  What happened to these? This is crazy.
[01:22.180 --> 01:29.900]  I don't think I'm going to tighten up in pain every, like, hour or so and then have to get up and...
[01:29.900 --> 01:31.160]  Oh, this is great.
[01:31.880 --> 01:35.940]  The thing with chairs is I never know how to use them, is the problem.
[01:36.580 --> 01:38.460]  Like, this has a lot of switches and stuff.
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.380]  There's always switches and levers and buttons, and there's no instruction manual.
[01:43.700 --> 01:47.700]  So I just never use any of the attachments or, like, fancy stuff.
[01:48.120 --> 01:51.200]  It surely does have, like, a quick setup cheat sheet.
[01:51.200 --> 01:53.100]  There was no cheat sheet.
[01:53.440 --> 01:55.820]  You know who has one? Fucking YouTube.
[01:56.480 --> 01:59.060]  That's always confusing because it's... I don't know.
[01:59.400 --> 02:07.640]  I guarantee you there's some boring three-minute video that the company produced that explains very simply what each knob and whistle does.
[02:08.200 --> 02:11.280]  It probably... Do you think we could produce a more lively one?
[02:11.700 --> 02:11.960]  Yes.
[02:12.400 --> 02:15.720]  What if Andrew shoots a commercial that teaches the chair?
[02:16.440 --> 02:16.780]  It's great.
[02:17.460 --> 02:20.640]  I don't know how the chair... The problem is, how do I learn how to...
[02:20.640 --> 02:21.680]  What the f...
[02:21.680 --> 02:25.080]  I don't even know how to describe the thing, so how do I learn... How do I search?
[02:25.420 --> 02:29.400]  How do you... Do it like the cavemen do it. Start banging shit together until you make fire.
[02:29.760 --> 02:32.020]  Yeah, why don't you wangle one of the knobs and see what happens?
[02:32.360 --> 02:32.600]  Yeah.
[02:33.280 --> 02:34.080]  I don't...
[02:34.080 --> 02:37.520]  Turn something left, lift something up, lower a different one.
[02:37.520 --> 02:38.160]  It feels dangerous.
[02:38.400 --> 02:38.940]  Flip it to the right.
[02:39.720 --> 02:40.880]  Crank down one of them.
[02:41.440 --> 02:45.060]  I feel like there's certain knobs that only work if you're sitting in the chair when you use them.
[02:45.500 --> 02:46.520]  You are sitting in the chair.
[02:46.920 --> 02:51.060]  Yeah, but I don't want to use it while I'm sitting in it, because that just feels like that'll be disastrous.
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.380]  Why don't you just tease one of them to see what goes on?
[02:53.740 --> 02:59.000]  Some of these only work when you're sitting in it, and I'm currently sitting in it, so I won't be pressing any of these things.
[02:59.160 --> 03:05.140]  They wouldn't... They don't... They didn't put, like, escape levers in there to jettison you out of the house.
[03:05.260 --> 03:07.900]  Like, they're all designed to increase your comfort.
[03:08.500 --> 03:13.160]  I feel like I'm gonna hit this button, and the backrest is gonna snap down, and I'm gonna roll out the back of the chair.
[03:13.520 --> 03:15.260]  He's treating it like Wonka's elevator.
[03:15.260 --> 03:16.540]  It's a chair!
[03:16.580 --> 03:19.000]  I am! I don't trust any of it!
[03:19.660 --> 03:23.800]  It's very well-made. There's amazing... Like, there's so many things on it that's customizable.
[03:24.420 --> 03:25.360]  I just am scared.
[03:25.720 --> 03:28.260]  What do you mean? Just do something!
[03:28.680 --> 03:31.100]  I just flipped a lever! I don't know what I did!
[03:31.420 --> 03:32.760]  I don't know what I did!
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.080]  But it's up now.
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.320]  You just bought a Ferrari, but you only drive it to the mailbox and back.
[03:39.500 --> 03:42.140]  See, what's terrifying is there isn't a lever on the same side.
[03:42.620 --> 03:43.720]  So what did I just do?
[03:44.620 --> 03:45.740]  What? Oh.
[03:45.960 --> 03:49.740]  It could be, like, the amount of tilt back. It could be lumbar.
[03:50.300 --> 03:53.840]  It could be the forwards and backwards of the sitting part.
[03:54.520 --> 03:56.120]  See, there's a lot of things you can do.
[03:56.440 --> 03:57.880]  It's like a goddamn tank.
[03:59.000 --> 03:59.700]  Levers everywhere.
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.100]  How many pedals are there?
[04:01.720 --> 04:03.160]  Uh, six.
[04:04.180 --> 04:05.540]  Alright, calm down.
[04:07.780 --> 04:09.180]  Nobody needs that shit.
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.540]  It's not available.
[04:13.640 --> 04:14.680]  There's not a website anymore.
[04:15.240 --> 04:16.920]  So we got to do it here.
[04:17.220 --> 04:18.520]  Herman Miller doesn't have a website anymore?
[04:18.680 --> 04:25.920]  Oh, I've been having a pretty serious problem with my printer.
[04:26.940 --> 04:29.860]  What is this most serious issue you can have with a printer?
[04:30.140 --> 04:32.300]  So I print to it, right?
[04:32.360 --> 04:34.100]  It says, couldn't find printer.
[04:34.540 --> 04:36.980]  Or, like, it just doesn't print.
[04:37.780 --> 04:40.500]  And then I'll come back into my office, like, four hours later,
[04:40.660 --> 04:42.260]  and the thing is just on the floor.
[04:43.300 --> 04:45.120]  So my printer's just embarrassed.
[04:46.180 --> 04:47.700]  It doesn't want to print in front of me.
[04:47.820 --> 04:49.860]  I've never seen it print.
[04:51.180 --> 04:52.960]  Dude, dude, you have a shy printer.
[04:53.140 --> 04:56.880]  I dated a girl in the army who was the same way with eating.
[04:57.100 --> 04:58.220]  She wouldn't eat in front of me.
[04:58.220 --> 05:01.360]  She'd go to, like, Burger King, and she would wait till I look away,
[05:01.400 --> 05:03.860]  and then she'd take, like, a rabbit bite, and then, like, freeze up again.
[05:03.880 --> 05:06.620]  Or I'd go to the bathroom, and I'd come back, and she'd be going to town.
[05:06.620 --> 05:08.180]  She just, like, wouldn't eat in front of me.
[05:08.400 --> 05:12.160]  Your printer is... you gotta have a... you gotta sit down and have a conversation with your printer.
[05:13.040 --> 05:13.680]  I'm actually...
[05:13.680 --> 05:15.140]  You gotta put it at ease.
[05:15.620 --> 05:17.800]  I'm not even joking when I said I wanted to...
[05:17.800 --> 05:20.180]  when I thought I wanted to set up a camera to catch it printing,
[05:20.360 --> 05:22.060]  because it will never do it.
[05:22.120 --> 05:25.540]  I could ask it to print, and I'll sit in the room with it for three hours,
[05:25.660 --> 05:26.800]  and it knows when I've left.
[05:27.100 --> 05:29.320]  Dude, what if you ask it to print right now,
[05:29.380 --> 05:31.260]  and then we'll just see if it does before the end of the episode?
[05:32.100 --> 05:32.980]  I love it.
[05:33.320 --> 05:34.820]  Let me print...
[05:34.820 --> 05:36.220]  Can I give you something to print?
[05:36.700 --> 05:36.820]  Yeah.
[05:37.460 --> 05:38.840]  Print the Chubby logo.
[05:39.800 --> 05:41.780]  Printing the Chubby logo.
[05:42.860 --> 05:44.660]  Look at how happy Chubby guy is.
[05:44.760 --> 05:46.340]  So we're just wasting ink then, huh?
[05:46.720 --> 05:47.840]  No, this is great.
[05:48.180 --> 05:49.660]  Every fucking color on Earth.
[05:50.600 --> 05:50.940]  Chubby.
[05:50.940 --> 05:52.780]  Geoff has that tattooed somewhere on his body.
[05:54.160 --> 05:54.640]  Hey.
[05:55.340 --> 05:56.660]  Hey, don't tempt me.
[05:57.060 --> 05:57.480]  I got one.
[05:59.240 --> 06:01.080]  I'd love for you to have a Chubby tattoo.
[06:01.460 --> 06:02.660]  I haven't had a tattoo in a while.
[06:03.580 --> 06:05.180]  I don't really think about him very much anymore.
[06:05.520 --> 06:08.040]  I wish I had more, but that whole part of getting them is annoying.
[06:09.120 --> 06:09.940]  Barrier to entry stuff.
[06:10.060 --> 06:12.700]  Kind of like parasailing or whatever we were talking about.
[06:13.100 --> 06:15.540]  Your pictures can't be printed because this error occurred.
[06:15.780 --> 06:17.060]  An internal error occurred.
[06:19.540 --> 06:21.580]  The internal error is your present.
[06:23.680 --> 06:24.080]  Huh.
[06:24.380 --> 06:28.380]  That is a different error than I've got before.
[06:29.240 --> 06:30.760]  I will say, it's probably...
[06:30.760 --> 06:33.040]  I could see it being a Chubby issue.
[06:33.480 --> 06:37.740]  Because I don't think there's anything like official about the Chubby branding at this point.
[06:37.820 --> 06:39.880]  Now, I'm not familiar with Chubby.
[06:40.760 --> 06:41.760]  Oh my God.
[06:42.060 --> 06:45.980]  It's just error screen on top of error screen when Gavin tries to print this.
[06:46.160 --> 06:46.760]  That's unfortunate.
[06:48.060 --> 06:49.260]  Have you tried printing the law?
[06:49.960 --> 06:50.680]  It goes great.
[06:51.140 --> 06:51.360]  No.
[06:52.400 --> 06:54.240]  Don't try printing it full screen.
[06:54.380 --> 06:56.920]  Just do... try printing it smaller.
[06:57.100 --> 06:57.740]  Maybe that'll help.
[06:58.180 --> 06:59.020]  Oh yeah, there you go.
[06:59.020 --> 07:00.620]  What were you going to say, Geoff, about Chubby?
[07:00.860 --> 07:03.280]  I just am not familiar with Chubby as a brand.
[07:03.380 --> 07:05.040]  Is that a Canadian thing?
[07:05.360 --> 07:05.600]  Or is it...
[07:05.600 --> 07:08.240]  Brand of soda from Trinidad and Tobago.
[07:08.520 --> 07:08.960]  Oh.
[07:10.520 --> 07:11.740]  It used to be in Canada.
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.760]  Now, it's only available in the United States.
[07:14.400 --> 07:16.040]  At Walmart, specifically.
[07:16.720 --> 07:20.380]  We were talking about it when we were in between recordings.
[07:20.640 --> 07:22.080]  He had asked if I'd ever had those.
[07:22.180 --> 07:23.160]  And I said, no.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.460]  The ones that I... it's these.
[07:25.660 --> 07:28.120]  These cheap ass little nothing drinks.
[07:28.120 --> 07:30.720]  Oh yeah, dude, those. The little barrels?
[07:31.040 --> 07:31.560]  Fuck yeah.
[07:32.060 --> 07:33.540]  I don't even know what they're called.
[07:33.880 --> 07:38.520]  I just searched, like, plastic cheap drink 1990s.
[07:39.160 --> 07:41.220]  Yeah, those things are fucking great, dude.
[07:41.940 --> 07:44.000]  What are... what are the flavors?
[07:44.600 --> 07:46.320]  Red, orange, blue.
[07:46.320 --> 07:47.240]  There's a purple, blue.
[07:47.240 --> 07:47.640]  There's a purple.
[07:47.980 --> 07:49.000]  There's a green flavor.
[07:49.480 --> 07:50.940]  I think that's it.
[07:51.420 --> 07:52.300]  Don't know what they're called.
[07:52.520 --> 07:54.100]  They're, like, shaped like little barrels.
[07:54.600 --> 07:56.420]  You would never guess what they were called.
[07:56.420 --> 07:58.500]  What a ridiculous name for these.
[07:58.620 --> 07:59.080]  What is it?
[08:00.140 --> 08:01.160]  Little Hugs.
[08:01.360 --> 08:02.380]  What the...
[08:02.380 --> 08:03.500]  Fuck you.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.140]  Little Hugs Fruit Barrels.
[08:06.640 --> 08:07.360]  Motherfucker.
[08:07.560 --> 08:08.400]  That is what they're called.
[08:08.580 --> 08:09.880]  Fruit Barrels.
[08:10.040 --> 08:10.660]  They're discontent.
[08:10.800 --> 08:11.280]  Little Hugs.
[08:12.400 --> 08:12.880]  Lame.
[08:13.220 --> 08:15.380]  They were, like, a quarter.
[08:16.180 --> 08:16.920]  They were so cheap.
[08:17.360 --> 08:19.940]  So Chubby has...
[08:19.940 --> 08:23.260]  Pineapple Sunshine, Cream Scream,
[08:23.260 --> 08:26.880]  Orange Tango, or Tangy, whatever it is.
[08:27.340 --> 08:30.420]  Tutti Frutti, Purple Power, and Blueberry Blast.
[08:30.520 --> 08:31.920]  They have a... you get...
[08:31.920 --> 08:33.620]  You can get, like, a little six-pack of all the different flavors.
[08:34.400 --> 08:36.480]  I feel like we should get some of those.
[08:37.720 --> 08:39.780]  I feel like they're discontinued, sadly.
[08:39.980 --> 08:40.820]  The Chubbies aren't.
[08:41.060 --> 08:41.580]  You just said they're...
[08:41.580 --> 08:43.080]  Gavin, did you guys have a weird little drink?
[08:43.360 --> 08:44.320]  I thought we were talking Little Hugs.
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.020]  I had Panda Pops.
[08:47.660 --> 08:49.920]  They were probably the littlest drinks that I had.
[08:51.200 --> 08:52.760]  The littlest drinks.
[08:54.520 --> 08:56.440]  Is it... hang on, is it these?
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.060]  Oh, I remember them being smaller than... than that.
[09:02.260 --> 09:02.600]  I don't...
[09:02.600 --> 09:03.480]  Was that Panda Pop?
[09:03.880 --> 09:04.840]  I have no idea.
[09:05.300 --> 09:06.540]  I don't... I don't know.
[09:08.880 --> 09:09.840]  Panda Pops.
[09:10.180 --> 09:10.760]  I hated them.
[09:10.900 --> 09:13.260]  I didn't really like fizzy drinks.
[09:16.660 --> 09:18.880]  This guy's too wrapped up in his printer, man.
[09:18.880 --> 09:19.880]  I don't know about this.
[09:21.100 --> 09:22.560]  Do you guys remember these?
[09:22.680 --> 09:25.180]  I was thinking about these the other day, and I was going to ask...
[09:25.180 --> 09:25.560]  Oh, wow.
[09:25.680 --> 09:27.560]  Did they exist in Canada, Andrew?
[09:27.660 --> 09:30.520]  Or is this like an Outback Steakhouse kind of thing?
[09:31.040 --> 09:33.580]  I feel like that that is an Outback Steakhouse thing.
[09:33.660 --> 09:35.460]  I have no memory of Clearly Canadian.
[09:35.860 --> 09:36.580]  That's really funny.
[09:36.920 --> 09:38.580]  In the 80s, they were everywhere.
[09:38.980 --> 09:42.980]  Dude, yeah, that... like, that must have gone right up until about 1992.
[09:44.440 --> 09:47.620]  It feels like so early 90s, and they were gone.
[09:47.620 --> 09:48.700]  That's crazy.
[09:49.100 --> 09:49.520]  Disappeared.
[09:49.580 --> 09:52.020]  Why was Clearly Canadian discontinued?
[09:52.160 --> 09:53.660]  Poor management decisions.
[09:54.940 --> 09:57.360]  Founded in 87 in British Columbia.
[09:58.120 --> 09:58.940]  Oh, there you go.
[09:59.540 --> 10:00.680]  It was a little before your time, I guess.
[10:01.180 --> 10:02.040]  I guess so.
[10:02.500 --> 10:04.660]  You should... you should... if you can find some, you should get some.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.200]  In 1993, their annual sales hit 155 million.
[10:07.840 --> 10:08.220]  Jesus.
[10:09.280 --> 10:10.540]  I'm learning all about Little Hug.
[10:10.600 --> 10:12.240]  They also have Big Hug branded.
[10:12.520 --> 10:14.400]  It's the same product, but they're bigger.
[10:14.700 --> 10:15.480]  Oh, that's awful.
[10:15.480 --> 10:17.620]  You should not have a bigger...
[10:17.620 --> 10:18.600]  A bigger taste of happiness.
[10:19.160 --> 10:20.400]  There's just... it's just nothing.
[10:20.500 --> 10:21.200]  It's just sugar.
[10:21.400 --> 10:22.480]  It's like hummingbird food.
[10:22.760 --> 10:24.020]  Like, you should not be eating this.
[10:24.280 --> 10:29.820]  They sold it in 2015, I believe it said, and they reduced the sugar content.
[10:30.100 --> 10:31.240]  So it's not even gross.
[10:31.480 --> 10:35.480]  Okay, yeah, but a million reduced to 900,000 is still too much, you know what I mean?
[10:36.500 --> 10:39.680]  Dude, it's fucking shitting down rain outside my house right now.
[10:39.700 --> 10:41.520]  Yeah, it started.
[10:41.880 --> 10:42.900]  Just started, yeah.
[10:43.020 --> 10:43.960]  It's begun.
[10:45.280 --> 10:45.960]  Big Hug.
[10:46.480 --> 10:52.400]  Did you have... Geoff, I feel like this is after your time, but before probably everyone else's here.
[10:52.740 --> 10:54.400]  Did you guys have Raven's Revenge?
[10:54.720 --> 10:56.800]  I have never seen that in my life.
[10:56.840 --> 10:57.380]  I don't know what that is.
[10:57.400 --> 10:57.860]  I figured.
[10:58.160 --> 10:58.540]  I figured.
[10:58.660 --> 10:59.760]  What the goddamn is that food?
[11:00.560 --> 11:01.960]  Is that like a fruit roll-up?
[11:02.520 --> 11:03.480]  No, no, no, no.
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.700]  Like, it's... it's like... it's sugar... it's like sugar dust.
[11:08.320 --> 11:09.720]  Oh, like Pixie Stix?
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.240]  Kind of? Kind of.
[11:12.240 --> 11:19.860]  But, like, you would go to, like, the little Raven's Revenge station thing and you would, like, layer it with different flavors.
[11:20.060 --> 11:22.240]  Some of them were, like, really sour and some of them weren't. Whatever.
[11:22.540 --> 11:23.900]  Oh, so you make your own layers.
[11:24.360 --> 11:32.140]  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you would make, like, cool designs and then show your friends and then you would all just be in sixth grade eating nothing but sugar.
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.780]  It looks like something you would put in a letter to assassinate the president with.
[11:38.200 --> 11:40.760]  That does not look like edible food.
[11:41.480 --> 11:42.440]  Yes, I agree.
[11:43.100 --> 11:45.880]  Yeah, it's like something Ted Kaczynski would send to a college professor.
[11:47.660 --> 11:49.320]  We were inspired, you know?
[11:50.780 --> 11:53.220]  Yeah, that sums up the 90s, actually, now that you mention it.
[11:53.340 --> 11:55.340]  I'm surprised this generation has teeth.
[11:56.360 --> 11:57.440]  Yeah, some of us don't.
[11:57.580 --> 12:00.200]  Especially with what Nick is throwing down there with Fun Dip.
[12:00.380 --> 12:03.520]  Dude, we had Fun Dip in the office up until us going out of business.
[12:04.080 --> 12:06.920]  Fun Dip in an office! That's crazy.
[12:08.140 --> 12:10.940]  I've never had Fun Dip, but I've seen it a lot.
[12:11.580 --> 12:12.400]  Is Fun Dip good?
[12:12.860 --> 12:16.900]  The stick is the best thing on earth. I wish I could just buy the stick.
[12:17.320 --> 12:22.560]  If I could buy a six pack of sticks, like a stick pack, it's all I'd eat.
[12:23.360 --> 12:30.480]  Dude, what a power move it would be to just pull the stick out of a bag of Fun Dip and toss the bag out.
[12:30.580 --> 12:31.940]  I do that all the time. What are you talking about?
[12:32.560 --> 12:33.960]  I don't know what I'm saying. It's a ball of move.
[12:33.960 --> 12:35.820]  Wait, the stick is edible?
[12:36.340 --> 12:37.200]  Yeah, it's the best part.
[12:37.540 --> 12:40.740]  I always assumed it was just like a spoon.
[12:41.300 --> 12:51.980]  So it's flavored powder, and then when you're done with the flavored powder, the stick is just super pressed sugar.
[12:52.360 --> 12:54.820]  That doesn't have a flavor except sugar.
[12:55.180 --> 12:57.780]  It is sugar dipping in sugar and then you eat all of it.
[12:58.060 --> 13:00.840]  Yeah, it's a white flavor. That's how I would describe it. It tastes white.
[13:01.600 --> 13:02.300]  Big time.
[13:02.460 --> 13:05.480]  What was the best flavor of Fruit Barrel?
[13:06.000 --> 13:06.440]  Red.
[13:06.560 --> 13:10.320]  Uh, boy. Red or blue, probably.
[13:10.960 --> 13:12.280]  Fuck. Fuck.
[13:13.080 --> 13:15.300]  This website has orange and purple.
[13:15.940 --> 13:17.080]  The only ones they have.
[13:17.740 --> 13:19.680]  It's because they're the only ones left because nobody drank them.
[13:20.020 --> 13:21.160]  Yeah, because those aren't the good ones.
[13:21.700 --> 13:25.200]  Yeah. God damn it. Okay, I'll look into this. I want to try those.
[13:25.680 --> 13:28.460]  Because I feel like those are things I've only seen in movies or like TV.
[13:28.460 --> 13:31.520]  They suck. They're not good, you know?
[13:32.940 --> 13:36.960]  Speaking of shit, bad candy, do you remember wax cola?
[13:37.760 --> 13:40.540]  I think I know what you're talking about, but not that as a brand.
[13:41.200 --> 13:41.960]  Oh, God.
[13:42.700 --> 13:45.300]  Is it the drinks where you bite the top?
[13:45.760 --> 13:46.820]  Yeah, wax bottles. Yeah.
[13:47.820 --> 13:50.280]  But they're so small. I didn't really understand.
[13:50.300 --> 13:51.580]  I know, that's why they suck.
[13:51.900 --> 13:56.360]  You were supposed to bite the top and then drink them and then throw out the wax or chew on the wax?
[13:56.420 --> 13:57.280]  What was the plan with the wax?
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.560]  You chew on the wax.
[13:59.080 --> 13:59.280]  Yeah.
[13:59.580 --> 14:00.900]  Who wants to chew wax?
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.040]  I would put the whole bottle in my mouth at one time and just start chewing.
[14:05.340 --> 14:06.420]  That's what you mostly did.
[14:06.600 --> 14:07.600]  Yeah, until the flavor was gone.
[14:07.600 --> 14:07.960]  Oh, that tiny.
[14:08.020 --> 14:08.800]  You spit it out. Yeah.
[14:09.140 --> 14:10.040]  Yeah, they're small.
[14:10.400 --> 14:11.980]  Oh, I thought they were like full bottle size.
[14:14.240 --> 14:16.700]  Like a giant candle bottle.
[14:16.820 --> 14:17.480]  And you just like chew on the top like gum.
[14:17.500 --> 14:18.940]  That would be crazy.
[14:19.280 --> 14:22.120]  Just like walking around chewing on a giant-ass candle.
[14:23.720 --> 14:25.600]  That's exactly what I thought you were talking about.
[14:25.600 --> 14:27.300]  I want that now.
[14:27.400 --> 14:28.940]  That needs to be a thing that exists.
[14:29.440 --> 14:30.420]  I'm sure you could make that.
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.180]  What kind of wax is chewable?
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.520]  Listen, I'm already fucking...
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.120]  I'm doing pickling already.
[14:36.380 --> 14:39.780]  I don't have time to figure out how to make a wax bottle on top of the pickling.
[14:40.020 --> 14:43.500]  Then you gotta get into industrial glycine, start adding that in.
[14:43.560 --> 14:44.000]  It's a whole thing.
[14:46.120 --> 14:46.880]  Industrial glycine.
[14:46.940 --> 14:51.720]  It would be so funny to just bite the top off a soda bottle and drink it and then just eat the bottle.
[14:53.760 --> 14:56.280]  Like a coke product type thing.
[14:56.460 --> 14:57.240]  Like real soda.
[14:57.780 --> 15:01.020]  Because I don't even know what the liquid is in the wax bottles.
[15:01.100 --> 15:03.100]  Because it's certainly not... it's not soda.
[15:03.800 --> 15:06.080]  It's like a juice, I guess a fruit juice.
[15:06.420 --> 15:07.880]  I'd describe it as...
[15:07.880 --> 15:08.520]  Yeah, in quotes.
[15:08.980 --> 15:10.840]  Yeah, fruit in quotes.
[15:11.440 --> 15:14.840]  Did anybody else answer what the grossest food they eat is?
[15:16.060 --> 15:17.820]  Oh no, I'm trying to...
[15:17.820 --> 15:19.420]  I don't really have one for fruit.
[15:19.760 --> 15:24.580]  Sticking in the beverage realm, I really like the taste of Dasani water.
[15:24.720 --> 15:26.440]  And I feel like that just makes me a scumbag.
[15:26.440 --> 15:27.480]  You're a monster.
[15:27.680 --> 15:28.220]  That's crazy.
[15:29.240 --> 15:32.040]  That's the grossest... it's like drinking an oil slick.
[15:32.460 --> 15:35.320]  I know, everyone says that. I like it.
[15:35.720 --> 15:37.820]  I think it was banned in England.
[15:39.040 --> 15:39.480]  Probably.
[15:41.040 --> 15:42.080]  It's a shit bottled water.
[15:42.180 --> 15:43.920]  I think it's like the worst bottled water brand.
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.120]  It's... somehow you drink it and you're like less hydrated.
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.360]  I don't know how it happens.
[15:50.620 --> 15:52.140]  It's like a fucking tuxedo.
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.140]  Nick eats sardines with jalapenos and hot sauce?
[16:02.260 --> 16:02.460]  Yeah!
[16:02.960 --> 16:04.800]  Oh wait, it's like a...
[16:06.020 --> 16:07.780]  On what? Like just a bowl?
[16:08.060 --> 16:08.640]  Yeah, in a bowl.
[16:09.300 --> 16:11.560]  Like a bowl of fish and peppers and hot sauce?
[16:11.720 --> 16:11.880]  Yeah.
[16:12.560 --> 16:16.720]  This man is absolutely drinking fish stock on the side out of cans.
[16:16.960 --> 16:18.120]  I can't be stopped.
[16:18.800 --> 16:20.340]  What does that look like?
[16:20.680 --> 16:21.620]  Uh, gross.
[16:22.800 --> 16:30.060]  Can you... Nick, can you name on one hand the number of food you don't like that you wouldn't eat?
[16:30.500 --> 16:31.340]  Yeah, probably.
[16:31.660 --> 16:32.360]  What would you avoid?
[16:33.480 --> 16:39.900]  Because we ran into that issue earlier in the other show where I was trying to remember something I didn't like off the top of my head.
[16:40.920 --> 16:45.440]  I'd say the thing I don't like the most or would probably avoid is coconut?
[16:46.480 --> 16:48.880]  Yeah, that was weird.
[16:51.180 --> 16:54.120]  Considering what you... I didn't mean you're weird as in you're weird as a person.
[16:54.480 --> 16:59.000]  I meant of all the things for you not to like, coconut seems like a weird one.
[16:59.260 --> 17:00.620]  It might be the texture, I don't know.
[17:01.180 --> 17:02.180]  A lot of people don't like it.
[17:02.540 --> 17:04.060]  What about in chocolate form, like a bounty?
[17:04.860 --> 17:06.340]  Or like, what are yours? Mound?
[17:07.420 --> 17:08.080]  Mound's good.
[17:08.420 --> 17:09.120]  No, I can't do it.
[17:09.800 --> 17:10.920]  Why ruin good chocolate?
[17:11.020 --> 17:17.260]  Nick has that dog in him, not in the sense of like, not quitting, but he'll just eat whatever the fuck you put in front of him.
[17:17.500 --> 17:19.320]  Yeah, I mean, I'll slop it up, really.
[17:19.480 --> 17:20.080]  I mean, it's...
[17:20.080 --> 17:23.480]  Yeah, I mean, you guys are getting a better glimpse at what he is on the other show.
[17:23.540 --> 17:25.560]  On 100% Eat, it's just this all the time.
[17:25.720 --> 17:26.560]  Yeah, kinda.
[17:26.840 --> 17:31.180]  You know, Gav, you'll slop a lot of stuff up too in the grand scheme of things.
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.820]  Like, you're not into sugary candies and like, food that was created in a lab.
[17:36.820 --> 17:42.080]  But like, I remember touring Scotland and England with you and you ate haggis and all kinds of nasty shit.
[17:42.100 --> 17:43.040]  Oh, haggis is delicious!
[17:43.200 --> 17:44.860]  Uh, that was mainly trying stuff.
[17:45.080 --> 17:48.000]  I still didn't eat that raw meat that you ate in the Netherlands.
[17:48.340 --> 17:48.780]  Oh!
[17:49.680 --> 17:50.120]  Osversed.
[17:50.140 --> 17:50.680]  Raw meat?
[17:50.760 --> 17:51.560]  Yeah, I didn't...
[17:51.560 --> 17:52.220]  Osversed?
[17:52.660 --> 17:55.440]  I'm convinced of the way it was pranking you with that shit.
[17:55.760 --> 18:00.360]  Yeah, and he totally might have been, but we still ate it.
[18:00.720 --> 18:01.220]  It was not good.
[18:02.740 --> 18:04.120]  It was like, uh...
[18:04.120 --> 18:05.080]  It was like, what is it?
[18:05.080 --> 18:07.480]  I don't ever eat it, but what is that raw meat?
[18:08.020 --> 18:08.960]  It's always an appetizer.
[18:09.300 --> 18:10.540]  What's it called on a menu?
[18:10.780 --> 18:10.880]  Steak tartare?
[18:11.160 --> 18:11.440]  Tartare.
[18:11.900 --> 18:14.080]  It was like tartare shoved into these...
[18:14.900 --> 18:15.300]  Pffft!
[18:17.060 --> 18:17.460]  ...pickled...
[18:17.460 --> 18:18.240]  ...peppers.
[18:18.540 --> 18:18.860]  Ooh!
[18:19.220 --> 18:20.340]  And then you would just like...
[18:20.340 --> 18:24.180]  You would just like, pop it in your mouth and it would just be like an explosion of raw meat and...
[18:24.180 --> 18:24.640]  Blood.
[18:24.900 --> 18:25.800]  ...juice and blood.
[18:26.040 --> 18:26.960]  Yeah, it was...
[18:26.960 --> 18:27.560]  I'd try it.
[18:27.600 --> 18:28.660]  It was, uh... yeah.
[18:29.500 --> 18:30.500]  It wasn't great.
[18:32.740 --> 18:33.140]  Osversed.
[18:37.460 --> 18:38.660]  I lost him.
[18:38.680 --> 18:39.040]  I did.
[18:39.200 --> 18:39.440]  Yeah.
[18:39.560 --> 18:40.260]  Did Geoff lose power?
[18:40.320 --> 18:40.620]  Uh-oh.
[18:40.700 --> 18:43.400]  I mean, the weather...
[18:43.400 --> 18:46.500]  Just so you guys know, we've been recording for like the last few hours.
[18:47.120 --> 18:48.340]  If we're keeping this in.
[18:48.720 --> 18:51.780]  We've been recording for like the last few hours and over probably the last...
[18:51.780 --> 18:56.240]  I'd say 45 minutes to an hour, the weather has turned like insane.
[18:56.860 --> 18:58.120]  It was sunny and bright.
[18:58.200 --> 18:59.580]  I mowed my lawn this morning.
[19:00.000 --> 19:00.960]  Like, it was nice out.
[19:01.580 --> 19:03.240]  I'm in the dark at 4pm.
[19:03.800 --> 19:04.140]  It's so dark.
[19:05.080 --> 19:06.020]  It's almost 4pm.
[19:06.020 --> 19:09.140]  It is raining so hard.
[19:09.140 --> 19:14.240]  And I bet... I don't know if Geoff just lost power, but I got a feeling he did.
[19:14.520 --> 19:18.360]  Do we think that Geoff is a UPS guy?
[19:18.720 --> 19:18.940]  Nope.
[19:19.740 --> 19:20.100]  Hmm.
[19:20.860 --> 19:21.440]  UPS?
[19:21.800 --> 19:23.000]  Like the battery.
[19:23.720 --> 19:24.920]  Yeah, like the backup battery.
[19:25.680 --> 19:26.160]  Uh...
[19:26.160 --> 19:26.440]  No.
[19:27.100 --> 19:27.760]  Absolutely not.
[19:27.940 --> 19:33.020]  So, Andrew, the thing that I learned starting to work at Rooster Teeth was...
[19:34.340 --> 19:34.900]  Was that thunder?
[19:35.640 --> 19:36.100]  What?
[19:36.700 --> 19:36.740]  Thunder?
[19:37.360 --> 19:39.060]  Oh shit, I heard that through Discord.
[19:39.540 --> 19:40.120]  That's cool.
[19:41.040 --> 19:43.000]  Everything's crackling when the lightning strikes.
[19:45.680 --> 19:53.000]  The thing I learned when I started working at Rooster Teeth is that they are religious about their backup batteries, both at the office and at home.
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.460]  I never had run into that until I started working there.
[19:56.620 --> 19:56.640]  No.
[19:56.740 --> 19:57.860]  So many people have backups.
[19:58.100 --> 19:58.420]  It's really crazy.
[19:58.420 --> 19:59.740]  I got like five of them.
[19:59.940 --> 20:00.180]  Yeah.
[20:01.800 --> 20:02.880]  I have none.
[20:03.060 --> 20:05.020]  My power goes out and I just go, I guess that's it.
[20:05.360 --> 20:06.520]  I have a...
[20:06.520 --> 20:14.420]  Because I have a server that spins up like 60 drives and I'm so paranoid about a multiple drive head crash if the power goes out.
[20:14.480 --> 20:17.520]  So I've got a dual layer UPS for it.
[20:18.740 --> 20:19.200]  Oh wow.
[20:20.060 --> 20:20.520]  You're set.
[20:20.900 --> 20:21.220]  Bye, Geoff.
[20:21.300 --> 20:21.820]  There he goes.
[20:22.700 --> 20:24.040]  I haven't heard back from Geoff yet.
[20:24.140 --> 20:26.700]  I texted him to see what's up, but I haven't heard back from him.
[20:26.700 --> 20:31.260]  When I worked at an IT place, we had to do tape backups for servers.
[20:31.600 --> 20:32.520]  Did you ever do that stuff?
[20:32.980 --> 20:33.580]  Yeah, I got tapes.
[20:34.280 --> 20:34.800]  Jeez, man.
[20:34.860 --> 20:35.840]  That stuff's crazy.
[20:36.160 --> 20:36.440]  People.
[20:36.560 --> 20:37.200]  All right, I'm back.
[20:37.560 --> 20:38.120]  What happened?
[20:38.260 --> 20:38.820]  Welcome back, Geoff.
[20:38.940 --> 20:39.460]  Yeah, what's up?
[20:39.580 --> 20:39.960]  Did your power go out?
[20:40.560 --> 20:41.860]  No, my power didn't go out.
[20:41.920 --> 20:45.460]  Just my router just turned off, I guess.
[20:45.760 --> 20:46.780]  It was weird.
[20:47.140 --> 20:48.000]  You know, I've had a surge.
[20:48.420 --> 20:49.560]  I must have had a surge or something.
[20:49.660 --> 20:50.880]  Yeah, it just took it a second to come back on.
[20:50.940 --> 20:51.560]  So you're still recording?
[20:51.960 --> 20:53.020]  Yeah, I never stopped.
[20:53.120 --> 20:53.640]  Oh, sweet.
[20:53.920 --> 20:56.760]  I'm a fucking professional, dude.
[20:56.820 --> 20:57.260]  Come on.
[20:57.360 --> 20:58.460]  Are you a backup battery guy?
[20:59.740 --> 21:00.920]  No, no, no.
[21:02.780 --> 21:04.100]  No, but I never have been.
[21:04.220 --> 21:05.080]  I've never had a backup battery.
[21:05.080 --> 21:05.760]  Oh, that is fine.
[21:06.940 --> 21:07.440]  There you go.
[21:08.420 --> 21:10.540]  Well, I know you are, Gav, but is everybody else?
[21:10.780 --> 21:11.240]  I am now.
[21:11.300 --> 21:11.680]  No.
[21:12.380 --> 21:13.020]  Yeah, see?
[21:13.060 --> 21:14.780]  I'm a glow stick and candle guy.
[21:15.380 --> 21:20.380]  If I was a backup battery guy, then that would just mean that I would be indignant and annoyed
[21:20.380 --> 21:22.600]  when I didn't lose my audio and everybody else did.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.960]  This way, I'm a part of the group that loses the audio.
[21:31.080 --> 21:31.800]  Oh, shit.
[21:31.840 --> 21:33.040]  It is pissing it down.
[21:33.280 --> 21:34.040]  It's pretty rainy.
[21:34.120 --> 21:34.360]  I'm jealous.
[21:35.080 --> 21:36.060]  I'd go to sleep.
[21:36.480 --> 21:37.220]  Does it make you sleepy?
[21:37.380 --> 21:38.120]  Especially in that chair?
[21:38.120 --> 21:38.460]  Oh, yeah.
[21:38.780 --> 21:41.640]  I listen with the chair and I listen to the rain sounds while I sleep.
[21:42.500 --> 21:44.640]  What did I miss while I was gone, by the way?
[21:44.740 --> 21:46.040]  We're just talking about batteries.
[21:47.260 --> 21:49.880]  Andrew, do you think you'll learn your chair before the next episode?
[21:50.860 --> 21:52.860]  No, I've never learned a chair, ever.
[21:52.860 --> 21:59.740]  I feel like you spend so much time in your office chair that I want to know without even looking what all my knobs do.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.100]  I just get intimidated.
[22:03.540 --> 22:07.460]  Because what if I flip the thing and it changes and I don't know how to change back?
[22:07.760 --> 22:08.720]  Just remember what you did.
[22:08.860 --> 22:10.760]  Just do the reverse of what you just did.
[22:11.020 --> 22:13.080]  Yeah, but I didn't know what I did in the first place.
[22:13.180 --> 22:14.620]  How do I reverse what I didn't know?
[22:14.760 --> 22:16.640]  Not freaking Rubik's Cube.
[22:17.040 --> 22:19.800]  Film it. Film yourself doing it so you can go back and watch the tape.
[22:19.800 --> 22:21.220]  It's a chair, man!
[22:21.600 --> 22:24.000]  And you got, like, the chair.
[22:24.340 --> 22:30.740]  If you were ever to learn a chair to maximize your comfort, this would be the chair.
[22:31.120 --> 22:33.160]  You're right. I need to fully utilize this chair.
[22:33.360 --> 22:36.340]  I will put an effort in to learn all these buttons and switches.
[22:36.820 --> 22:40.040]  We've got a couple of weeks before we can record again.
[22:40.800 --> 22:41.740]  Exactly, Gavin.
[22:42.180 --> 22:44.780]  You should be, like, fucking Tank in the Matrix.
[22:44.780 --> 22:46.080]  Like, all laid out.
[22:47.080 --> 22:49.000]  Just, like, coding like crazy.
[22:49.120 --> 22:49.660]  Coding comedy.
[22:50.260 --> 22:51.060]  I need to.
[22:51.860 --> 22:56.800]  I think that by the time you're back, by the time we're back together,
[22:57.480 --> 23:02.720]  you should at least be able to show us a couple of tricks that you learned about your chair.
[23:02.780 --> 23:03.300]  You got it.
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.980]  Comedy is all about setting something up and then having someone deliver for you.
[23:09.200 --> 23:11.180]  It's a one-two effort, or even larger.
[23:11.180 --> 23:13.640]  The general structure is always that.
[23:13.780 --> 23:16.500]  You can see it in some of the all-time great comedy duos.
[23:16.700 --> 23:19.680]  Whether it's, like, Ian Peele, Abbott Costello, Fey and Poehler.
[23:19.760 --> 23:22.220]  I mean, there's so many you can pick from, but that's sort of irrelevant.
[23:22.560 --> 23:26.900]  The point is, you kind of need somebody to help you knock things out of the park.
[23:27.180 --> 23:28.720]  And that's you and Shopify.
[23:29.140 --> 23:30.720]  It comes to growing your business.
[23:31.160 --> 23:35.880]  Shopify is the global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your business.
[23:36.060 --> 23:40.480]  As people who just started a business, it's so exciting to know that there is a service
[23:40.480 --> 23:43.060]  like Shopify that can help us at the beginning.
[23:43.200 --> 23:44.840]  Can help us if we're more established.
[23:45.040 --> 23:49.080]  Just knowing that they're there and that they have the tools to get us to the next level.
[23:49.340 --> 23:50.860]  Because that's what you want to do. You want to grow.
[23:51.020 --> 23:51.940]  You're starting a business.
[23:52.160 --> 23:54.600]  Because they're there from the launch your online shop stage
[23:54.600 --> 23:56.420]  to the first real-life store stage
[23:56.420 --> 23:59.260]  all the way to the, did we just hit a million order stage?
[23:59.820 --> 24:01.840]  Shopify is here to help you grow.
[24:01.920 --> 24:03.000]  To get to those goals.
[24:03.180 --> 24:06.120]  It doesn't matter if you're selling grown tubes or clogged tubes.
[24:06.300 --> 24:07.180]  They got you.
[24:07.180 --> 24:11.180]  They have a number one leading e-commerce platform
[24:11.180 --> 24:13.480]  to their in-person POS system
[24:13.480 --> 24:15.460]  wherever and whatever you're selling
[24:15.460 --> 24:16.500]  they have your back.
[24:16.680 --> 24:17.800]  Gotta love that about Shopify.
[24:18.280 --> 24:20.480]  They also help you turn browsers into buyers
[24:20.480 --> 24:22.380]  with the internet's best converting checkout.
[24:22.820 --> 24:24.480]  Up to 36% better
[24:24.480 --> 24:26.640]  compared to other leading commerce platforms.
[24:27.060 --> 24:28.880]  36% that is significant.
[24:29.220 --> 24:31.260]  They also sell more with less effort
[24:31.260 --> 24:32.940]  thanks to Shopify's magic
[24:32.940 --> 24:34.560]  your AI powered all-star.
[24:34.820 --> 24:36.800]  Who doesn't love having an all-star on their roster?
[24:36.800 --> 24:39.780]  It's great. Shopify powers 10% of all e-commerce
[24:39.780 --> 24:40.760]  in the US
[24:40.760 --> 24:42.820]  and Shopify's the global force behind
[24:42.820 --> 24:45.240]  Allbirds, Rothy's, Brooklinen
[24:45.240 --> 24:46.960]  and millions of other entrepreneurs
[24:46.960 --> 24:49.820]  of every size across 175 countries.
[24:50.060 --> 24:50.700]  It's a lot.
[24:50.820 --> 24:53.240]  Plus, Shopify's extensive help resources
[24:53.240 --> 24:54.940]  are there to support your success
[24:54.940 --> 24:56.400]  every step of the way.
[24:56.640 --> 24:59.100]  Because businesses that grow, grow with Shopify.
[24:59.400 --> 25:01.420]  You have no idea. Someone who's just started a business
[25:01.420 --> 25:03.640]  knowing that if you're having any issues
[25:03.640 --> 25:05.260]  you can reach out and get assistance
[25:05.260 --> 25:07.120]  It's so huge. It's such relief.
[25:07.520 --> 25:09.680]  Just a fantastic all-around service
[25:09.680 --> 25:11.300]  and that's really what I love about Shopify
[25:11.300 --> 25:13.860]  is that they let you take control
[25:13.860 --> 25:15.620]  and they give you the guidance
[25:15.620 --> 25:18.100]  and the support to take your business
[25:18.100 --> 25:19.220]  to the next level
[25:19.220 --> 25:20.640]  or wherever you want it to go.
[25:20.780 --> 25:23.920]  It's great. So please sign up for $1 per month

[25:35.560 --> 25:37.440]  Shopify.com
[25:37.440 --> 25:38.920]  slash face
[25:40.060 --> 25:41.340]  If everyone here was a
[25:41.340 --> 25:42.680]  Matrix character, who would you be?
[25:43.800 --> 25:44.840]  Ooh, Neo.
[25:47.220 --> 25:48.060]  Yeah, man.
[25:52.250 --> 25:53.670]  I'd be Roy Jones Jr.
[25:53.770 --> 25:54.730]  character. I don't remember his name.
[25:55.690 --> 25:57.650]  Who? Roy Jones Jr.?
[25:58.290 --> 25:59.130]  He was in the Matrix.
[25:59.870 --> 26:01.610]  Yeah. I don't remember that.
[26:01.970 --> 26:02.630]  Who was he in the Matrix?
[26:03.570 --> 26:05.090]  I don't remember his name. Let me look it up.
[26:05.090 --> 26:06.190]  What was the character then? What did he do?
[26:09.850 --> 26:11.470]  Geoff just wants to be Roy Jones Jr.
[26:11.690 --> 26:12.810]  He was one of the dudes.
[26:13.070 --> 26:14.950]  He was a good guy.
[26:15.150 --> 26:17.090]  I'd be the guy that says I want to eat steak.
[26:17.490 --> 26:19.350]  No way, baby. I'm Joey Pants.
[26:19.690 --> 26:20.550]  You're right. You're right.
[26:21.010 --> 26:22.890]  Yep. I'm Cypher.
[26:22.990 --> 26:24.190]  Hey, ignorance is bliss.
[26:25.110 --> 26:27.110]  That steak looks...
[26:27.110 --> 26:29.030]  Every time I watch that scene, I really
[26:29.030 --> 26:30.490]  want steak. It just looks so good.
[26:30.970 --> 26:32.630]  And the way he eats it is so weird.
[26:32.630 --> 26:34.530]  It makes you...
[26:35.050 --> 26:37.070]  You watch that scene, and it makes you realize
[26:37.610 --> 26:39.090]  look, I don't agree
[26:39.090 --> 26:41.190]  with what this guy is saying, but boy
[26:41.730 --> 26:43.130]  that is just everything
[26:43.130 --> 26:44.810]  to him, and it looks phenomenal.
[26:45.370 --> 26:47.050]  But if you were him, I feel like
[26:47.050 --> 26:49.110]  if I was in his situation, I would think exactly
[26:49.110 --> 26:50.990]  like him. Morpheus just keeps killing
[26:50.990 --> 26:52.190]  people. He keeps
[26:52.810 --> 26:54.910]  pulling people out of the Matrix, and they keep dying.
[26:55.490 --> 26:56.430]  Right. Okay.
[26:56.590 --> 26:58.150]  It's Ballard. That's who I'd be.
[26:59.670 --> 27:00.110]  Okay.
[27:01.850 --> 27:03.450]  I have no idea
[27:03.450 --> 27:04.770]  Roy Jones Jr. was in.
[27:05.750 --> 27:06.330]  Hell yeah he was.
[27:07.110 --> 27:08.950]  I don't... Why was Roy Jones
[27:08.950 --> 27:10.450]  Jr. in?
[27:11.070 --> 27:12.610]  Why? Why not?
[27:12.750 --> 27:12.910]  What?
[27:14.710 --> 27:16.690]  I don't... I don't understand.
[27:17.670 --> 27:18.970]  It just looks like a bunch
[27:18.970 --> 27:20.450]  of people cosplaying a con.
[27:21.990 --> 27:22.930]  Well, you know,
[27:22.990 --> 27:24.910]  that's kind of what 2 and 3 looked like to me, so
[27:24.910 --> 27:25.770]  that's par for the course.
[27:26.790 --> 27:28.690]  I don't know if I... I don't think I know
[27:28.690 --> 27:30.950]  the Matrix well enough to make this declaration.
[27:31.650 --> 27:33.490]  I would be Agent...
[27:34.670 --> 27:35.110]  Uh...
[27:35.110 --> 27:37.130]  Smith? I found out the names of the other
[27:37.130 --> 27:38.830]  agents, by the way. You know, there was like originally
[27:38.830 --> 27:40.230]  three agents. Oh yeah.
[27:40.630 --> 27:42.890]  I just... I didn't know there were more names
[27:42.890 --> 27:45.070]  beyond Smith. Like the square-headed
[27:45.070 --> 27:46.270]  guy is Jones, isn't it?
[27:46.750 --> 27:48.870]  Yeah, there's Smith, there's Jones, and there's Brown.
[27:49.350 --> 27:51.030]  What were Jones and Brown doing
[27:51.990 --> 27:53.250]  while Smith was fucking around?
[27:53.350 --> 27:54.790]  Like, were they fighting a different Neo
[27:54.790 --> 27:56.250]  in a different part of the world?
[27:56.710 --> 27:57.670]  Having their own adventure?
[27:58.110 --> 27:59.670]  I think he just assimilates them, doesn't he?
[28:00.030 --> 28:01.050]  Yeah, I think so.
[28:01.290 --> 28:04.750]  Like, doesn't he...
[28:04.750 --> 28:06.530]  Like, Smith is the one that
[28:06.530 --> 28:08.750]  breaks out of being part of
[28:08.750 --> 28:10.670]  this thing, like as an agent
[28:10.670 --> 28:12.810]  or whatever. And he just assimilates these guys.
[28:13.130 --> 28:14.290]  Yeah, he gets, like, anomalied.
[28:14.370 --> 28:16.290]  And then he gets out of the Matrix at some point
[28:16.290 --> 28:18.270]  into a guy that kind of... Oh, it's the guy
[28:18.270 --> 28:20.110]  in your picture, Geoff. The guy next to him.
[28:20.430 --> 28:21.690]  Yeah. Oh, okay.
[28:21.810 --> 28:23.810]  Smith gets out of the Matrix into that guy.
[28:25.210 --> 28:26.410]  Boy, those movies
[28:27.950 --> 28:28.430]  really...
[28:28.430 --> 28:29.590]  Those movies suck.
[28:30.190 --> 28:32.570]  But if you lumped them all in
[28:32.570 --> 28:34.670]  with Matrix 4, those two movies are a masterpiece.
[28:35.370 --> 28:36.290]  Do you remember...
[28:36.290 --> 28:38.950]  Was it 2 or 3 that he pumped
[28:38.950 --> 28:40.750]  Kerry and Moss' heart back
[28:40.750 --> 28:42.310]  to life? Oh, yeah.
[28:42.370 --> 28:43.850]  He squeezes it. Yeah.
[28:45.390 --> 28:46.270]  Third one, I think.
[28:46.530 --> 28:47.350]  That was pretty cool.
[28:49.210 --> 28:50.170]  We're just talking
[28:50.570 --> 28:52.570]  about the Matrix. I stand by Matrix 4
[28:52.570 --> 28:54.930]  as my favorite Matrix. No, you shut up.
[28:54.970 --> 28:56.270]  No, you don't. It is.
[28:56.410 --> 28:57.210]  It's my favorite.
[28:57.450 --> 29:00.930]  Wait, what did you say? Matrix 4 is your favorite?
[29:01.570 --> 29:02.790]  It's my favorite of the rest.
[29:02.890 --> 29:04.110]  I never saw it.
[29:05.250 --> 29:05.530]  I don't know.
[29:06.270 --> 29:08.350]  3 was so fucking painful to get through.
[29:08.430 --> 29:10.250]  I don't know why I forced myself to get through 4.
[29:10.630 --> 29:11.830]  Why is 4 your favorite?
[29:12.510 --> 29:13.930]  I just had the most fun with it.
[29:14.070 --> 29:16.350]  I feel like I was maybe a little bit too young
[29:16.350 --> 29:18.570]  when the first Matrix came out to appreciate it
[29:18.570 --> 29:19.630]  at that time.
[29:19.630 --> 29:21.230]  You can still watch it now.
[29:21.690 --> 29:23.590]  Yeah, I've gone back and I've rewatched it
[29:23.590 --> 29:24.810]  and it just doesn't connect.
[29:24.990 --> 29:27.170]  It's cool. It's a cool movie, but
[29:27.170 --> 29:29.590]  it doesn't connect with me in the way that
[29:29.590 --> 29:31.730]  other people talk about it. Gavin, it's no Matrix 4.
[29:32.350 --> 29:33.570]  It is no Matrix 4.
[29:33.590 --> 29:35.710]  It has the burly brawl and the mile-long
[29:35.710 --> 29:36.710]  highway that they built.
[29:36.950 --> 29:38.090]  What happens in the fourth one?
[29:38.870 --> 29:39.890]  Neil Patrick Harris.
[29:41.450 --> 29:42.370]  That's what happens.
[29:43.030 --> 29:44.290]  They talk about stuff.
[29:46.490 --> 29:47.830]  I don't think they talk about stuff
[29:47.830 --> 29:48.710]  in any of the other movies.
[29:48.850 --> 29:50.190]  It's a unique thing of Matrix 4.
[29:51.490 --> 29:54.010]  There is some meta.
[29:54.530 --> 29:55.830]  Is there meta stuff in the other
[29:55.830 --> 29:57.910]  Matrix movie where they're talking
[29:57.910 --> 29:59.650]  about their own franchise within the movie?
[29:59.930 --> 30:00.150]  No.
[30:01.310 --> 30:02.190]  That sucks.
[30:03.250 --> 30:05.590]  No, it's great. They're analyzing
[30:05.590 --> 30:07.750]  their own film series within the movie. It's good.
[30:08.730 --> 30:09.590]  Didn't the Wachowskis,
[30:09.710 --> 30:10.970]  do they still make things together?
[30:11.650 --> 30:14.010]  Did they make that together or was that only one of them?
[30:14.630 --> 30:15.650]  I think it was just Lana Wachowski.
[30:15.650 --> 30:18.170]  Yeah, I don't think they collaborated on that.
[30:18.790 --> 30:19.570]  What I will say is,
[30:19.950 --> 30:21.530]  regardless of any of the movies, none of them
[30:21.530 --> 30:22.210]  are in the Matrix.
[30:23.230 --> 30:24.810]  Which we do need to still play.
[30:26.510 --> 30:27.710]  Great. Gavin, why'd you say
[30:27.710 --> 30:29.070]  oh my god? I've got an update.
[30:29.890 --> 30:30.430]  Oh, okay.
[30:34.870 --> 30:35.630]  What's your update?
[30:37.310 --> 30:37.710]  Oh,
[30:37.910 --> 30:39.530]  Brennan! Wait, so
[30:39.530 --> 30:40.850]  did you see it happen?
[30:41.270 --> 30:43.430]  No, I had my headphones on and didn't hear it.
[30:43.430 --> 30:45.850]  This was on the floor when I turned around.
[30:47.490 --> 30:49.450]  So you don't even know if there was
[30:49.450 --> 30:51.570]  a hesitation. Well, it didn't print
[30:51.570 --> 30:53.410]  for at least five minutes because I was
[30:53.410 --> 30:54.950]  keeping an eye on it after I hit print.
[30:55.590 --> 30:57.410]  Can I ask a serious question about the
[30:57.410 --> 30:58.770]  Matrix real quick? Yeah.
[30:59.230 --> 31:00.790]  Oh, it's Geoff. When did Geoff go?
[31:01.770 --> 31:03.890]  Geoff's been gone. He'll be back.
[31:04.310 --> 31:05.510]  Are you kidding me?
[31:05.630 --> 31:07.290]  He had nothing to say about
[31:07.290 --> 31:08.870]  everything Andrew was just saying?
[31:09.410 --> 31:11.430]  Geoff's back. Do you remember
[31:11.430 --> 31:12.850]  in War of the Worlds
[31:13.890 --> 31:15.370]  when the noise
[31:15.370 --> 31:17.410]  the monsters would make in War of the Worlds?
[31:18.550 --> 31:18.950]  Yeah.
[31:19.690 --> 31:21.550]  I just heard that noise outside
[31:21.550 --> 31:23.530]  my house and then I lost internet for a second.
[31:23.970 --> 31:24.910]  So there may be
[31:25.630 --> 31:27.330]  an alien invasion going on
[31:27.330 --> 31:29.250]  right now. I don't know. Keep an eye out in the lightning
[31:29.250 --> 31:31.650]  strikes. There might be something coming down in them.
[31:31.770 --> 31:33.370]  Oh, shit. Good call.
[31:33.370 --> 31:35.250]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I just had to get that out. No, it's fine.
[31:35.470 --> 31:37.310]  I was going to ask a very important Matrix question.
[31:38.110 --> 31:39.350]  What type of
[31:39.350 --> 31:41.170]  canned gravy would Agent Smith
[31:41.170 --> 31:42.030]  most be into?
[31:43.070 --> 31:44.810]  You think he's a caramelized onion?
[31:44.950 --> 31:46.670]  Yeah, he is.
[31:46.810 --> 31:49.270]  What kind of things is he
[31:49.270 --> 31:50.170]  fermenting in his fridge?
[31:51.230 --> 31:53.710]  Oh, God. Not fish.
[31:54.010 --> 31:54.970]  Not that much.
[31:55.350 --> 31:57.290]  That dude? I bet you a thousand
[31:57.290 --> 31:58.830]  dollars that dude ferments okra.
[31:59.730 --> 31:59.990]  Oh.
[32:00.930 --> 32:02.170]  That's what he's into.
[32:03.590 --> 32:05.130]  Like fucking slimy
[32:05.130 --> 32:06.490]  fermented pickled okra.
[32:07.090 --> 32:08.490]  I'm still just trying to figure out
[32:08.490 --> 32:10.230]  why Roy Jones Jr. was in the Matrix.
[32:10.890 --> 32:11.790]  I'd love to know.
[32:12.250 --> 32:13.090]  Do you think he knows?
[32:13.890 --> 32:16.270]  Do you think he really liked the Matrix and so they put him in?
[32:16.350 --> 32:17.530]  How did that happen?
[32:17.970 --> 32:19.830]  I think he was a fan, probably, or something.
[32:20.410 --> 32:21.310]  Did you ever listen to his album?
[32:22.070 --> 32:24.630]  Yeah, actually I did. It was around the time
[32:24.630 --> 32:26.310]  that he was ending
[32:26.310 --> 32:28.190]  his boxing career, so he's probably
[32:28.190 --> 32:30.170]  in that point where they're like,
[32:30.210 --> 32:32.710]  do you make the transition to movies or commentating
[32:32.710 --> 32:34.470]  or maybe
[32:35.310 --> 32:36.570]  that's not the right move
[32:36.570 --> 32:38.370]  for you at all? Maybe just
[32:38.370 --> 32:39.930]  go quietly into the night?
[32:40.530 --> 32:42.190]  Which is, I think, what he ultimately decided to do.
[32:42.250 --> 32:43.690]  Until he came out to fight Tyson.
[32:44.170 --> 32:45.450]  Was that last year? Two years ago?
[32:46.110 --> 32:47.810]  Yeah, it was two years ago, I think.
[32:47.890 --> 32:49.530]  Again, I'm just more of a fan of his music.
[32:50.950 --> 32:52.510]  He did have a great rap album.
[32:52.970 --> 32:54.370]  He was one of the best boxers
[32:54.370 --> 32:56.510]  of all time. He just retired
[32:56.510 --> 32:57.530]  four fights too late.
[32:57.930 --> 33:00.370]  I think his music was the theme song
[33:00.370 --> 33:02.850]  to one of those boxing games.
[33:03.610 --> 33:04.630]  I think you're right.
[33:04.750 --> 33:06.990]  I think you're right. I think it was Can't Be Touched.
[33:07.090 --> 33:08.150]  That was a good one. Hey,
[33:08.730 --> 33:10.730]  real quick, rewind it back a little bit. Gavin,
[33:10.810 --> 33:12.030]  you said you had a game or something?
[33:12.590 --> 33:13.170]  Oh yeah!
[33:16.170 --> 33:17.010]  It's been postponed.
[33:18.090 --> 33:18.450]  What?
[33:19.250 --> 33:21.230]  What does that mean?
[33:21.510 --> 33:22.810]  I just thought of a way to improve it
[33:22.810 --> 33:23.810]  and I need more time.
[33:24.950 --> 33:25.610]  Fair enough.
[33:26.490 --> 33:28.630]  Because I realized, I remember we could do stuff for Patreon.
[33:29.390 --> 33:29.750]  Yep.
[33:30.590 --> 33:31.450]  Oh, wow.
[33:31.590 --> 33:33.650]  So you're talking about
[33:33.650 --> 33:35.950]  a supplemental that is for Patreon.
[33:36.090 --> 33:36.870]  Oh, interesting.
[33:36.890 --> 33:39.810]  It's a supplemental that is going to have stuff that we probably
[33:39.810 --> 33:40.470]  can't put on YouTube.
[33:41.870 --> 33:42.710]  I'm excited.
[33:43.170 --> 33:45.430]  Because I remember that we can put clips.
[33:45.850 --> 33:46.610]  It's going to be clip heavy.
[33:47.650 --> 33:48.130]  Interesting.
[33:49.050 --> 33:50.770]  Are we talking about my dick again?
[33:51.710 --> 33:51.950]  No.
[33:52.470 --> 33:53.990]  If you want.
[33:54.130 --> 33:55.010]  No, thank you.
[33:55.010 --> 33:55.590]  Dick Ramsey?
[33:56.810 --> 33:57.750]  No, thank you.
[33:59.810 --> 34:00.990]  It's funny, sometimes
[34:00.990 --> 34:03.030]  when I have conversations with my mom
[34:03.030 --> 34:05.250]  I feel like the way you guys
[34:05.250 --> 34:06.450]  react to me sometimes
[34:06.910 --> 34:08.770]  when I'm listening to things that are
[34:08.770 --> 34:10.350]  happening in her life.
[34:10.950 --> 34:13.110]  My mom can no longer go to her favorite bakery.
[34:13.810 --> 34:14.570]  She has ruined
[34:14.570 --> 34:16.670]  her favorite bakery for her
[34:16.670 --> 34:19.710]  in a way that is so stupid.
[34:20.450 --> 34:21.390]  And I say that
[34:21.390 --> 34:22.510]  in the nicest of ways.
[34:23.250 --> 34:24.550]  Did you take all the money
[34:24.550 --> 34:25.190]  out of her purse?
[34:25.710 --> 34:26.490]  I didn't, no.
[34:29.310 --> 34:30.330]  Have you ever been
[34:30.330 --> 34:32.590]  locked in to like you're going to go
[34:32.590 --> 34:34.270]  to a place and get something
[34:34.270 --> 34:36.010]  and then when they don't have that thing
[34:36.010 --> 34:37.310]  you're completely thrown?
[34:37.870 --> 34:40.050]  Like you have no plan B and you fumble?
[34:40.930 --> 34:42.250]  Have you ever had that experience?
[34:42.750 --> 34:44.370]  I feel like it's never to the point where it's like
[34:44.790 --> 34:45.750]  I don't know what to do.
[34:45.990 --> 34:47.450]  Usually I go...
[34:49.330 --> 34:50.330]  You're not like my mom.
[34:50.330 --> 34:52.030]  She went to her bakery
[34:52.030 --> 34:54.630]  she hasn't been to in a little bit, to get cookies.
[34:55.010 --> 34:55.930]  This is what she told me.
[34:56.390 --> 34:58.410]  She was excited to get these chocolate chip cookies.
[34:58.810 --> 35:00.430]  She was doing something that day that she was stressed
[35:00.430 --> 35:02.590]  about, so she thought I'll get these cookies
[35:02.590 --> 35:04.550]  and this will like kind of start my day off right.
[35:05.170 --> 35:05.970]  And she went in
[35:05.970 --> 35:08.390]  and she... it's the same lady
[35:08.390 --> 35:10.310]  that works there, it's a small local bakery.
[35:10.770 --> 35:12.330]  And she's always had the same person
[35:12.330 --> 35:13.610]  that she interacts with every time.
[35:13.970 --> 35:14.770]  Is she known by name?
[35:15.570 --> 35:18.170]  I don't think so. It is a thing where they don't know
[35:18.170 --> 35:19.830]  each other's names, I assume.
[35:20.350 --> 35:22.270]  But it's like, it's always the same
[35:22.270 --> 35:23.290]  person behind the counter.
[35:24.150 --> 35:26.070]  And she went in and she said, I'll have two cookies.
[35:26.490 --> 35:28.170]  And the lady said, oh we
[35:28.170 --> 35:29.670]  stopped making cookies
[35:29.670 --> 35:31.990]  because we're making donuts now.
[35:32.950 --> 35:33.830]  And my mom
[35:33.830 --> 35:35.510]  was not prepared for this.
[35:35.930 --> 35:38.390]  Her brain immediately went, there's a bunch
[35:38.390 --> 35:40.330]  of really good donut places
[35:40.330 --> 35:42.210]  around. I don't know why you
[35:42.210 --> 35:44.230]  would make donuts. This is her internal
[35:44.230 --> 35:46.470]  thought. Oh, she's not saying that.
[35:46.470 --> 35:48.450]  She's not saying that. She's thinking this.
[35:48.610 --> 35:49.070]  Oh, thank god.
[35:49.530 --> 35:52.330]  So the lady behind the counter
[35:52.330 --> 35:54.450]  says, would you like to try one of our jelly
[35:54.450 --> 35:56.530]  donuts? And my mom replies
[35:56.530 --> 35:58.270]  with, I can't have those.
[35:58.410 --> 36:00.430]  Was what came out. Which is
[36:00.430 --> 36:02.270]  not true. There's no allergy.
[36:03.910 --> 36:04.870]  There's no...
[36:04.870 --> 36:05.790]  It's just not a thing.
[36:06.470 --> 36:08.550]  And the lady went, uh...
[36:08.550 --> 36:10.530]  Well we have cinnamon sugar donuts as
[36:10.530 --> 36:12.550]  well. And my mom doubled down
[36:12.550 --> 36:14.130]  and went, I can't have those either.
[36:15.770 --> 36:16.270]  You're
[36:16.270 --> 36:18.330]  so related and we are getting
[36:18.330 --> 36:19.990]  a more full picture of you.
[36:20.070 --> 36:21.070]  This is crazy.
[36:21.910 --> 36:22.970]  There's a pause.
[36:23.670 --> 36:26.030]  And then my mom said she didn't know how to
[36:26.030 --> 36:27.930]  handle the silence that was there.
[36:28.130 --> 36:30.210]  So she just said the first thing that came to her mind
[36:30.210 --> 36:32.170]  and she said, if you want a good
[36:32.170 --> 36:34.090]  donut, go to Milk Jam Donuts.
[36:34.150 --> 36:36.530]  Which is a different donut place
[36:37.130 --> 36:37.630]  nearby.
[36:38.710 --> 36:39.030]  And
[36:39.810 --> 36:42.340]  the lady looked at her and said
[36:44.080 --> 36:44.960]  I would
[36:44.960 --> 36:46.520]  recommend, and then she said
[36:46.520 --> 36:48.560]  a different place. And that
[36:48.560 --> 36:50.440]  was it. And then my mom left and she
[36:50.440 --> 36:52.360]  was the entire time just thinking,
[36:52.460 --> 36:54.340]  why did I say that? Why did I say any of that?
[36:54.720 --> 36:56.180]  That was all dumb.
[36:56.380 --> 36:57.460]  That was all terrible to say.
[36:58.160 --> 36:59.520]  She locked herself out of donuts.
[37:00.120 --> 37:02.340]  She is now locked out. Well no, plenty
[37:02.340 --> 37:04.280]  of donut places. She can't get
[37:04.280 --> 37:05.840]  any other baked goods.
[37:06.380 --> 37:08.640]  You're right. There's no going back from that.
[37:08.940 --> 37:10.480]  No. So when you tell
[37:10.480 --> 37:12.480]  a person at a bakery
[37:12.480 --> 37:14.040]  where they should get donuts
[37:14.040 --> 37:16.320]  that they sell that isn't theirs.
[37:16.540 --> 37:18.460]  Do you think maybe if she went in with your
[37:18.460 --> 37:20.200]  balaclava, she could get some stuff?
[37:21.580 --> 37:22.040]  Honestly,
[37:22.400 --> 37:24.480]  for how bad of a position she's
[37:24.480 --> 37:26.440]  left herself there, it would
[37:26.440 --> 37:28.200]  actually help. It would be a step up.
[37:28.340 --> 37:30.360]  You know, I never thought about that, but
[37:30.360 --> 37:32.620]  if we ever get a chance, we should reprint
[37:32.620 --> 37:34.460]  that balaclava and sell it as
[37:34.460 --> 37:35.480]  a do-over mask.
[37:36.980 --> 37:38.760]  The ultimate mulligan mask?
[37:38.760 --> 37:40.460]  Yeah, the ultimate mulligan mask.
[37:43.060 --> 37:44.860]  That has been the most recent
[37:44.860 --> 37:46.920]  thing with my mom, as well as she keeps asking
[37:46.920 --> 37:48.820]  me who says awesome sauce, and I
[37:48.820 --> 37:49.900]  don't know how to answer that.
[37:51.860 --> 37:52.740]  She has
[37:52.740 --> 37:54.740]  asked me on three separate
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.800]  occasions, and I just don't know
[37:56.800 --> 37:58.780]  what to say. The answer is simple.
[38:01.180 --> 38:02.580]  She's like, who says
[38:02.580 --> 38:04.880]  awesome sauce? And I was so taken aback.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.740]  I said, what do you mean? And she said,
[38:06.740 --> 38:08.120]  somebody says it.
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.820]  And I said, it was like a phrase a long time ago
[38:10.820 --> 38:12.980]  that some... it's like an internet thing, kind of
[38:13.600 --> 38:14.440]  way back.
[38:14.880 --> 38:16.600]  And she said, no, no, that's not it.
[38:16.640 --> 38:18.180]  There is a specific person
[38:18.700 --> 38:20.600]  that is known for saying it. Who is it?
[38:20.900 --> 38:22.780]  And I have no idea who she's talking about.
[38:23.320 --> 38:24.440]  And she just keeps asking.
[38:24.700 --> 38:26.040]  She keeps asking.
[38:27.060 --> 38:28.520]  She forgets that she's
[38:28.520 --> 38:30.600]  asked me. Enough time will
[38:30.600 --> 38:32.660]  pass, and then she will ask me again,
[38:32.800 --> 38:34.520]  and it sticks out because I
[38:34.520 --> 38:36.300]  maintain to not know how to respond.
[38:36.600 --> 38:38.680]  Who is the person that says awesome sauce?
[38:39.760 --> 38:40.600]  I guess if anyone's
[38:40.600 --> 38:42.560]  listening knows, please let
[38:42.560 --> 38:44.320]  me know so I can forward it to her.
[38:44.520 --> 38:45.580]  Because she keeps asking.
[38:46.040 --> 38:48.720]  Was it invented by
[38:48.720 --> 38:49.820]  Homestar Runner?
[38:50.260 --> 38:51.660]  Is that a Homestar Runner thing?
[38:52.100 --> 38:53.900]  I can't imagine your mom being on Homestar.
[38:54.200 --> 38:56.300]  You think your mom is watching
[38:56.300 --> 38:58.460]  Homestar? She like loves strong, bad
[38:58.460 --> 38:59.540]  emails in the chat.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.540]  Oh, I think I
[39:02.540 --> 39:03.740]  have the answer for you.
[39:05.360 --> 39:05.680]  It's
[39:06.820 --> 39:08.520]  Chris Pratt in Parks and Rec.
[39:08.880 --> 39:10.420]  Maybe. That is...
[39:10.420 --> 39:12.520]  Yes! That would be it. She did watch Parks and Rec.
[39:12.740 --> 39:13.780]  Thank you, Geoff. Jesus.
[39:14.360 --> 39:16.540]  It's either him or the lady, Aubrey Plaza.
[39:16.740 --> 39:18.560]  I see both of them in this. I don't know. Well, ask
[39:18.560 --> 39:20.520]  her if it was Chris Pratt or ask her if it
[39:20.520 --> 39:21.380]  was Homestar Runner.
[39:22.800 --> 39:24.300]  I'm sure that's not where she got it from.
[39:24.360 --> 39:26.500]  I'm just surprised that that's where it originated from.
[39:28.820 --> 39:29.380]  Huh.
[39:30.720 --> 39:32.720]  Mrs. Panton really into the cheat.
[39:33.160 --> 39:34.760]  She's really into it.
[39:34.980 --> 39:36.140]  That's what I'm saying.
[39:36.380 --> 39:37.700]  She's a big fan of Coach Z.
[39:39.480 --> 39:40.960]  The whole gang's
[39:40.960 --> 39:42.720]  here and they want to
[39:42.720 --> 39:45.140]  say awesome sauce to Andrew's
[39:45.140 --> 39:45.480]  mom.
[39:47.180 --> 39:48.500]  I can just imagine her
[39:48.500 --> 39:50.620]  walking home from the bakery muttering to
[39:50.620 --> 39:52.580]  herself about awesome sauce and then coming
[39:52.580 --> 39:54.600]  home and sitting in a chair that she doesn't know how to use.
[39:58.300 --> 39:58.680]  Laughing.
[40:02.660 --> 40:04.680]  I'm so excited for this to be you in a few
[40:04.680 --> 40:06.320]  years and get to go through it with you, Andrew.
[40:07.360 --> 40:08.800]  To me asking you about
[40:08.800 --> 40:10.700]  awesome sauce? Yeah, like when you hit the
[40:10.700 --> 40:12.720]  A, like, because we'll still be friends when you're
[40:12.720 --> 40:14.500]  in your, you know, 50s or 60s. Sure.
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.720]  This is, you are,
[40:16.820 --> 40:18.700]  you know, we are who our parents, or
[40:18.700 --> 40:20.440]  we will be who our parents are now, right? So.
[40:21.320 --> 40:22.300]  I hope not.
[40:22.640 --> 40:24.680]  To that level. I don't want to get blocked
[40:24.680 --> 40:25.440]  out of a bakery.
[40:26.560 --> 40:28.720]  You are the, if I had to pick a person
[40:28.720 --> 40:30.880]  in my life who stood the highest chance
[40:30.880 --> 40:32.020]  of getting blocked from a bakery,
[40:32.240 --> 40:34.300]  you would be the only person on the list.
[40:35.140 --> 40:35.500]  Laughing.
[40:35.640 --> 40:38.640]  You told us a story about your mom
[40:38.640 --> 40:40.620]  that should have just been about, like,
[40:40.640 --> 40:42.680]  if you told us that, you're like, I lied, it was me.
[40:42.780 --> 40:44.320]  Like, everyone would just go, yeah.
[40:45.020 --> 40:45.240]  Yeah.
[40:45.960 --> 40:48.440]  You can be honest with us. Was it you?
[40:49.040 --> 40:50.460]  No, it wasn't me. You sure?
[40:50.580 --> 40:52.640]  I wish it was. Was it you
[40:52.640 --> 40:54.500]  wondering what a buttplug was
[40:54.500 --> 40:55.300]  this whole time?
[40:58.420 --> 41:00.600]  She knows about, she knows about
[41:00.600 --> 41:02.420]  those now. She's informed.
[41:03.340 --> 41:04.760]  What would be the funniest thing to put
[41:04.760 --> 41:05.460]  on a buttplug?
[41:06.320 --> 41:07.200]  A bottle of chubby.
[41:08.360 --> 41:08.680]  Laughing.
[41:09.720 --> 41:10.600]  Strong bad.
[41:11.500 --> 41:12.100]  Laughing.
[41:14.360 --> 41:16.300]  One of these, one of these little fucks
[41:16.300 --> 41:18.300]  I just posted a picture of
[41:18.300 --> 41:20.140]  from Star Runner.
[41:20.140 --> 41:20.640]  Laughing.
[41:21.900 --> 41:23.400]  Like, what about a grown plug?
[41:24.640 --> 41:24.960]  Oh!
[41:26.160 --> 41:27.180]  Hear it with every step.
[41:29.160 --> 41:29.560]  Wow.
[41:31.160 --> 41:33.840]  Isn't part of the thing with buttplugs, those people not
[41:33.840 --> 41:35.280]  knowing it's in?
[41:35.920 --> 41:38.020]  Well, some of them have, like, tails on the back and
[41:38.020 --> 41:39.480]  No, I guess it's true.
[41:40.120 --> 41:41.900]  Yeah, you know, maybe it's like a sense of danger,
[41:41.980 --> 41:43.780]  like, oh my God, when I go to the grocery store,
[41:43.880 --> 41:44.660]  everyone will hear me.
[41:44.980 --> 41:45.120]  Laughing.
[41:46.160 --> 41:47.900]  I really want somebody
[41:47.900 --> 41:49.820]  to have that in and then fall down a hill.
[41:50.360 --> 41:51.000]  Laughing.
[41:51.320 --> 41:53.220]  They'll think I'm brushing my teeth,
[41:53.360 --> 41:55.520]  but it's just my buttplug.
[41:57.340 --> 41:59.540]  What if it was triggered
[41:59.540 --> 42:01.600]  by you farting, like the air
[42:01.600 --> 42:03.240]  shooting the pipe up?
[42:03.960 --> 42:04.200]  Dude!
[42:05.140 --> 42:05.960]  Like an amplifier.
[42:07.160 --> 42:07.800]  Laughing.
[42:11.980 --> 42:13.520]  It's like a kazoo.
[42:13.940 --> 42:14.340]  Laughing.
[42:14.480 --> 42:16.800]  What are those things they put on the German planes
[42:17.220 --> 42:19.040]  when they dive to make the terrifying
[42:19.040 --> 42:20.080]  dive sound?
[42:21.620 --> 42:23.120]  I got no fucking clue what you're talking about.
[42:23.400 --> 42:24.340]  Yeah, I don't know.
[42:26.180 --> 42:27.500]  I know what you mean,
[42:27.860 --> 42:29.280]  but the...
[42:29.680 --> 42:31.440]  Like, one of those, but for farts.
[42:32.080 --> 42:32.480]  Laughing.
[42:33.400 --> 42:35.520]  Oh, they would, like, they would put a...
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.360]  They would stick a playing card in the spokes
[42:37.360 --> 42:38.020]  of the plane, right?
[42:38.780 --> 42:39.180]  Laughing.
[42:39.180 --> 42:39.520]  Laughing.
[42:41.980 --> 42:42.860]  Stuka siren.
[42:43.260 --> 42:44.140]  Stuka siren, that was it.
[42:44.640 --> 42:46.200]  Yeah, it's like a little air-driven
[42:47.180 --> 42:49.080]  thingy that they would use to scare people
[42:49.080 --> 42:49.520]  on the ground.
[42:50.340 --> 42:52.520]  Do you think the guy, the woo guy,
[42:52.720 --> 42:54.060]  the whistle goes woo?
[42:54.480 --> 42:55.440]  You know what I'm talking about?
[42:55.740 --> 42:56.500]  Bub rub?
[42:56.900 --> 42:59.720]  You talking about Bub Rub and Lil Sis?
[43:00.400 --> 43:01.600]  Yeah, I'm talking about Bub Rub.
[43:01.880 --> 43:04.540]  You think Bub Rub has a stuka siren on his plane?
[43:05.260 --> 43:06.120]  And he's the first one?
[43:06.120 --> 43:07.800]  Gotta get those noises.
[43:07.960 --> 43:09.720]  What do you think Bub Rub's doing today?
[43:09.800 --> 43:10.760]  He's still around, right?
[43:11.020 --> 43:14.600]  I don't know. I love Bub Rub.
[43:14.600 --> 43:16.120]  That's gotta be 15
[43:16.120 --> 43:17.480]  years old, right?
[43:18.160 --> 43:19.960]  15? Is that what you said?
[43:20.180 --> 43:21.840]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[43:22.520 --> 43:23.840]  Minimum, it's gotta be 15.
[43:23.940 --> 43:25.000]  It's gotta be more, don't you think?
[43:25.460 --> 43:26.160]  Who is Bub Rub?
[43:26.900 --> 43:28.500]  You don't remember the whistle goes woo?
[43:29.600 --> 43:30.740]  Yeah, you said all that.
[43:32.240 --> 43:33.860]  You don't know Bub Rub?
[43:33.860 --> 43:35.480]  No, I don't know Bub Rub.
[43:35.780 --> 43:37.900]  It was from... I'll post a link
[43:37.900 --> 43:39.860]  to the YouTube video, but just watch it later
[43:39.860 --> 43:41.900]  or whatever. It was from a news
[43:41.900 --> 43:43.260]  report in the
[43:44.060 --> 43:45.820]  Bay Area, I think.
[43:46.440 --> 43:47.920]  And they had
[43:47.920 --> 43:49.780]  whistles on their
[43:49.780 --> 43:51.300]  cars, like on the muffler tips.
[43:51.700 --> 43:54.080]  And it would whistle when you drove by
[43:54.080 --> 43:55.660]  and they interviewed Bub Rub
[43:55.660 --> 43:57.420]  and Lil Sis about it.
[43:57.620 --> 43:59.720]  And he talks about how it's only
[43:59.720 --> 44:01.800]  in the morning, you're supposed to be up cooking breakfast.
[44:01.800 --> 44:03.400]  And then he keeps imitating
[44:03.400 --> 44:05.280]  the whistle. And in
[44:06.400 --> 44:07.640]  2004, funniest thing
[44:07.640 --> 44:08.060]  in the world.
[44:08.400 --> 44:11.480]  Can we watch it right now and play the audio
[44:11.480 --> 44:12.780]  or get in trouble?
[44:13.400 --> 44:15.220]  I mean, I wouldn't put the audio
[44:15.220 --> 44:17.560]  in a wide-release podcast.
[44:18.280 --> 44:18.760]  Honestly?
[44:19.540 --> 44:20.320]  Hey, you know what?
[44:20.820 --> 44:22.940]  Hey, let's put it to a vote.
[44:23.640 --> 44:24.240]  Try it.
[44:24.920 --> 44:27.640]  Yes. Any opportunity
[44:27.640 --> 44:28.380]  to listen to Bub Rub?
[44:28.380 --> 44:29.040]  Absolutely.
[44:29.760 --> 44:32.240]  Well, now I'm scared. I don't know. I think I'm a no.
[44:32.560 --> 44:34.320]  Good. Okay. Nick?
[44:34.560 --> 44:35.560]  I'm horrified. No.
[44:36.800 --> 44:37.460]  I gotta vote no.
[44:38.040 --> 44:39.740]  I gotta vote no. That's fair.
[44:40.640 --> 44:42.300]  That is a no vote that I
[44:42.300 --> 44:43.800]  support. I'm okay with it.
[44:44.080 --> 44:46.120]  I mean, you voted yes, but
[44:46.120 --> 44:48.200]  yeah, I mean, I get it. Yeah, because I wanted it, but
[44:48.200 --> 44:50.260]  I'm glad that the adults in the room stood
[44:50.260 --> 44:51.540]  up and didn't allow it to happen.
[44:51.900 --> 44:54.380]  Well, I was immediately thinking, you can have three strikes on YouTube,
[44:54.540 --> 44:56.480]  but also one strike makes you lose
[44:56.480 --> 44:58.220]  features, and then I was starting to think,
[44:58.300 --> 44:59.520]  oh, what's that worth?
[45:00.760 --> 45:02.140]  Yeah. That's a good point.
[45:02.820 --> 45:04.820]  I wonder who even owns
[45:04.820 --> 45:06.700]  the kron4.com
[45:06.700 --> 45:07.480]  archival footage.
[45:08.900 --> 45:10.460]  What was it, like Traffic's
[45:10.460 --> 45:12.380]  Vuvuzela? What was the noise?
[45:12.480 --> 45:14.860]  Dude, you just fucking nailed it. That's 100%
[45:14.860 --> 45:16.200]  it. That's better than I could have
[45:16.200 --> 45:16.820]  described it.
[45:18.480 --> 45:20.520]  It's just that Bub Rub is a character.
[45:21.700 --> 45:22.300]  And it's like,
[45:22.660 --> 45:24.280]  it's basically, you know how when you
[45:24.280 --> 45:26.180]  do man-on-the-street interviews,
[45:26.380 --> 45:28.340]  like, sir, come over here, what is your name? And your name's
[45:28.340 --> 45:30.320]  like, oh, my name's Gavin Free, and they're like, what do you think
[45:30.320 --> 45:32.140]  about the construction in the neighborhood? And you're like, well,
[45:32.220 --> 45:34.200]  you know, it's inconvenient, but I appreciate that they're making
[45:34.200 --> 45:36.080]  improvements. It was like that kind of thing,
[45:36.240 --> 45:38.260]  but the dude walks up, he's like, my name's Bub Rub,
[45:38.420 --> 45:40.060]  this little sis. And you're like,
[45:40.240 --> 45:42.320]  what? And then he just
[45:42.320 --> 45:43.620]  goes into a little thing. It's very funny.
[45:44.100 --> 45:46.500]  It's really good. Definitely worth your time.
[45:47.140 --> 45:48.060]  Has anyone watched
[45:48.060 --> 45:50.000]  the documentary Chillin' at the Mansion
[45:50.620 --> 45:51.260]  featuring himself?
[45:51.260 --> 45:52.180]  No.
[45:52.760 --> 45:53.060]  What?
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.560]  He collaborated with people,
[45:57.160 --> 45:59.200]  it says Linnell would hook up
[45:59.200 --> 46:01.180]  with the administrators of the website
[46:01.180 --> 46:03.280]  BubRub.com, who started selling BubRub-themed
[46:03.280 --> 46:05.260]  shirts, underwear, and even
[46:05.260 --> 46:07.160]  ringtones. The website also
[46:07.160 --> 46:09.320]  went on to promote and sell a DVD documentary
[46:09.320 --> 46:11.300]  titled Chillin' at the Mansion
[46:11.300 --> 46:12.780]  featuring Linnell himself.
[46:13.480 --> 46:15.240]  I didn't know that he turned
[46:15.240 --> 46:17.220]  this into an industry, but I'm into
[46:17.220 --> 46:18.980]  it. We need to do a watch-along of that.
[46:18.980 --> 46:21.140]  It's a 17-minute
[46:21.140 --> 46:22.940]  video that looks like it's just him
[46:22.940 --> 46:24.960]  talking to the camera. Just him
[46:24.960 --> 46:27.080]  chillin' at the mansion. I bet that's a long 17
[46:27.080 --> 46:28.880]  minutes. Yeah, I bet it's
[46:28.880 --> 46:29.520]  long.
[46:31.280 --> 46:33.260]  Some people just perfectly monetize
[46:33.260 --> 46:33.700]  the moment.
[46:35.460 --> 46:37.120]  Would you rather watch the entirety
[46:37.120 --> 46:39.040]  of BubRub Chillin' at the Mansion or
[46:39.040 --> 46:40.960]  Painkiller The Making of Part 1
[46:40.960 --> 46:41.720]  again? BubRub.
[46:43.460 --> 46:44.960]  I'd pay $1,000 to
[46:44.960 --> 46:46.380]  shoot a horse to watch BubRub.
[46:50.340 --> 46:51.080]  Maybe something
[46:51.080 --> 46:52.800]  we should touch on that has
[46:52.800 --> 46:55.060]  warped all of our views, I'd like to think
[46:55.060 --> 46:57.140]  since we did it. We did a movie battle!
[46:57.480 --> 46:59.220]  We did a summer movie auction
[46:59.220 --> 46:59.920]  thing.
[47:00.980 --> 47:02.720]  That'll be a supplemental. I'm getting
[47:02.720 --> 47:04.820]  page ads on this BubRub thing
[47:04.820 --> 47:06.500]  for The Strangers Chapter 1,
[47:06.880 --> 47:09.120]  which I don't like as someone who doesn't own it.
[47:09.500 --> 47:10.820]  I saw a trailer for it the other night
[47:10.820 --> 47:12.880]  and I was like, God damn. Did it scare you?
[47:13.280 --> 47:14.020]  Yeah, a little bit.
[47:15.080 --> 47:16.840]  I also don't remember what
[47:16.840 --> 47:18.540]  fucking movies I got, apparently, because
[47:18.540 --> 47:20.700]  I got sucked into thinking I had The Crow.
[47:23.160 --> 47:24.840]  So we did a thing where we listed out
[47:24.840 --> 47:26.820]  all the summer releases and then we had an
[47:26.820 --> 47:28.920]  auction for who got what
[47:28.920 --> 47:31.160]  and the goal is to build
[47:31.160 --> 47:32.860]  a roster of movies
[47:33.380 --> 47:34.700]  that will earn the most
[47:34.700 --> 47:36.360]  domestically by the end of the summer.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.040]  So we all got different things.
[47:39.500 --> 47:40.880]  I'm very excited for people to
[47:40.880 --> 47:42.880]  watch it. And we all understood it immediately.
[47:43.700 --> 47:44.760]  Yep. We did.
[47:45.680 --> 47:46.960]  Once an example
[47:46.960 --> 47:48.940]  was given, it was
[47:48.940 --> 47:50.960]  like, oh, okay, I get what we're doing
[47:50.960 --> 47:52.900]  here. Every time it was explained to
[47:52.900 --> 47:54.840]  us before that, dude, it
[47:54.840 --> 47:56.840]  couldn't make heads or tails of it. I'm sorry, Andrew.
[47:57.160 --> 47:58.740]  I love how hesitantly we
[47:58.740 --> 48:00.740]  entered that recording and how excited
[48:00.740 --> 48:02.560]  we were at the end of it. Oh my God.
[48:03.100 --> 48:04.500]  Like, we just wanted to do that for everything.
[48:04.940 --> 48:06.500]  Do you think If has already made me
[48:06.500 --> 48:07.620]  $200 million yet?
[48:10.820 --> 48:12.880]  It has spurred some
[48:12.880 --> 48:14.860]  really fun trash-talking in our Slack
[48:14.860 --> 48:17.020]  that I am excited to continue throughout the summer.
[48:17.080 --> 48:19.040]  You and Eric going at it last night was funny.
[48:19.180 --> 48:20.720]  Cannot believe that's how the game
[48:20.720 --> 48:23.020]  started last night. That was fucking unreal.
[48:23.580 --> 48:24.880]  I was freaking
[48:25.780 --> 48:26.800]  out, like, standing
[48:26.800 --> 48:28.800]  up from my seat, going
[48:28.800 --> 48:30.880]  Yeah! Harold the Purple Crayon!
[48:32.020 --> 48:32.980]  So you're at
[48:32.980 --> 48:34.840]  an Austin FC game last night
[48:34.840 --> 48:36.920]  and you own the film
[48:36.920 --> 48:39.080]  Harold and the Purple Crayon, which stars
[48:39.080 --> 48:41.040]  Zachary Levi. Yeah, absolutely.
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.180]  And did they promote
[48:43.180 --> 48:45.020]  Harold and the Purple Crayon when he was doing his
[48:45.020 --> 48:47.020]  Austin FC thing or was it just, hey, celebrity
[48:47.020 --> 48:49.220]  here? It was just like, Austin
[48:49.220 --> 48:50.800]  resident, Zachary Levi,
[48:51.020 --> 48:53.140]  and I was, like, yelling at people to watch
[48:53.140 --> 48:54.900]  Harold and the Purple Crayon. Harold! Harold!
[48:56.340 --> 48:57.260]  That's right, he does
[48:57.260 --> 48:58.680]  live here, doesn't he? Uh-huh.
[48:59.240 --> 49:01.080]  Is that why he was on the podcast that one time?
[49:01.460 --> 49:02.360]  I assume so. Yeah, probably.
[49:02.900 --> 49:04.980]  Huh. When was
[49:04.980 --> 49:06.460]  did he promote Shazam 2?
[49:07.760 --> 49:09.340]  I think he was probably promoting
[49:09.340 --> 49:11.460]  Shazam 1. I think it was
[49:11.460 --> 49:13.380]  Shazam 1. Yeah. That makes sense.
[49:14.680 --> 49:15.220]  I really...
[49:15.220 --> 49:17.340]  maybe we should see if he wants to come on and
[49:17.340 --> 49:19.360]  promote Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[49:19.920 --> 49:21.200]  No, we can't do that!
[49:21.400 --> 49:22.780]  That's unfair! We can't
[49:23.260 --> 49:25.340]  unfairly tip the scales in our
[49:25.340 --> 49:27.240]  own competition. I will say,
[49:27.500 --> 49:29.320]  I don't want to tip the scales.
[49:29.780 --> 49:31.340]  I'll leave it up to the people
[49:31.340 --> 49:33.380]  to have Harold
[49:33.380 --> 49:35.540]  and the Purple Crayon bring in $350 million
[49:36.800 --> 49:37.280]  without
[49:37.280 --> 49:39.040]  our help at all. We got this.
[49:39.680 --> 49:41.320]  I really like the idea of
[49:41.320 --> 49:42.900]  Eric booking Zachary Levi
[49:42.900 --> 49:45.200]  and then us voting that he can't come on
[49:45.200 --> 49:46.980]  and be a democracy while he's here.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.120]  He's, like, waiting in the wings.
[49:48.860 --> 49:51.220]  If he books Zachary Levi,
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.640]  I get to book Michael Keaton for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.
[49:53.740 --> 49:55.140]  Oh, please! Go for it!
[49:55.520 --> 49:57.240]  I'm for it! If you want to book Michael
[49:57.240 --> 49:59.280]  Keaton for this podcast, please. Please do.
[49:59.640 --> 50:01.300]  Mr. Keaton, you are officially invited.
[50:01.420 --> 50:03.100]  Thank you. I'm booking
[50:03.100 --> 50:04.780]  Kozner, then, for part two of that
[50:04.780 --> 50:05.940]  tragic movie.
[50:06.260 --> 50:08.580]  But you have to be careful. You have to be careful
[50:08.580 --> 50:09.840]  because you don't have part one.
[50:10.660 --> 50:12.600]  You'll be promoting my part one.
[50:12.720 --> 50:14.120]  You gotta bring him on after.
[50:14.480 --> 50:16.040]  You gotta do it between the two.
[50:17.780 --> 50:18.840]  So when is that coming out?
[50:19.080 --> 50:20.740]  I'm really excited. I would love for that to come out
[50:20.740 --> 50:21.640]  as soon as possible.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.400]  Are we gonna stop putting out drafts?
[50:24.400 --> 50:25.280]  We got some of those done?
[50:25.480 --> 50:28.640]  We have a lot coming down the pipe. A lot.
[50:29.160 --> 50:30.640]  We've been very...
[50:30.640 --> 50:32.860]  since sort of, like, okay, the shutdown's
[50:32.860 --> 50:34.860]  happening, and us going, okay, we're gonna keep
[50:34.860 --> 50:36.820]  doing this. We started just...
[50:36.820 --> 50:38.780]  and I give a lot of credit to Andrew, just
[50:38.780 --> 50:40.900]  let's keep going. Let's just keep
[50:40.900 --> 50:42.980]  going. And it's really
[50:42.980 --> 50:44.960]  exciting. I'm very excited for everything
[50:44.960 --> 50:46.420]  coming out. Oh, big time.
[50:47.200 --> 50:47.920]  Big, big, big time.
[50:47.920 --> 50:50.800]  And, like, fun gas once we get everything
[50:50.800 --> 50:52.940]  set up. Oh, yeah, we're lubing that pipe up
[50:52.940 --> 50:53.780]  with fun gas.
[50:55.480 --> 50:57.000]  Has anyone ever lubed anything
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.140]  with gas? Then we're gonna shoot so many
[50:59.140 --> 51:00.860]  fucking comedy butt
[51:00.860 --> 51:02.820]  plugs out of it, all over the audience.
[51:03.240 --> 51:04.760]  I, like, as soon as we get
[51:04.760 --> 51:06.900]  into the realm of just, like, appreciating the audience
[51:06.900 --> 51:08.760]  for the support, Geoff takes it to, like,
[51:08.840 --> 51:10.440]  jeers and butts. Always.
[51:11.200 --> 51:12.460]  But I'm just trying to
[51:13.220 --> 51:14.760]  illustrate how excited
[51:14.760 --> 51:16.880]  we all are to be doing the Regulation Podcast
[51:16.880 --> 51:18.560]  and to be having
[51:18.560 --> 51:21.020]  such an amazing groundswell of support
[51:21.020 --> 51:22.580]  from the audience, who I think are just
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.600]  And it really lubes up your creative dick.
[51:25.820 --> 51:26.760]  the greatest people
[51:26.760 --> 51:28.860]  on Earth. And, I mean, I guess you could say that. I was just
[51:28.860 --> 51:30.820]  gonna say that I really, genuinely
[51:30.820 --> 51:32.680]  from the bottom of my heart, just appreciate
[51:33.240 --> 51:34.540]  not only the support
[51:37.420 --> 51:38.980]  but just the well-wishes
[51:38.980 --> 51:40.520]  and just the
[51:40.520 --> 51:42.300]  general feeling
[51:42.860 --> 51:45.160]  and camaraderie and commiseration
[51:45.160 --> 51:46.920]  I feel amongst all of them. If you want it to
[51:46.920 --> 51:48.900]  be whatever that thing you just said was, it's cool
[51:48.900 --> 51:51.020]  too, but I just, you know, I don't know.
[51:51.120 --> 51:51.860]  I just really
[51:54.260 --> 51:55.060]  genuinely appreciate
[51:55.060 --> 51:56.580]  and love and feel
[51:56.580 --> 51:58.360]  indebted to our audience
[51:58.360 --> 52:00.280]  and I just want to entertain them in the best way possible.
[52:00.840 --> 52:02.400]  It is a constant
[52:02.400 --> 52:04.620]  shock, and shock not in the
[52:04.620 --> 52:06.540]  sense of surprise, but like
[52:06.540 --> 52:08.660]  our community is so wonderful
[52:08.660 --> 52:09.680]  and supportive
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.440]  and there have been so many instances
[52:12.440 --> 52:14.340]  since we launched of that being
[52:14.340 --> 52:16.640]  displayed. It is constantly
[52:16.640 --> 52:17.960]  just like, how did
[52:18.360 --> 52:19.920]  this happen around us?
[52:20.660 --> 52:22.500]  We're so unbelievably
[52:22.500 --> 52:24.340]  lucky. It's been fun seeing
[52:24.340 --> 52:26.460]  you pop up in the Discord, Geoff.
[52:26.960 --> 52:28.340]  I've been having
[52:28.340 --> 52:30.500]  fun. It's funny because I've
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.460]  largely strayed away from
[52:32.460 --> 52:33.020]  online
[52:35.840 --> 52:36.360]  anything
[52:36.360 --> 52:37.040]  for a while.
[52:38.480 --> 52:40.540]  Discord is a little overwhelming
[52:41.200 --> 52:42.540]  to jump right
[52:42.540 --> 52:43.960]  into and there's so much going on.
[52:44.080 --> 52:46.420]  There's like 10,000 people on the Discord
[52:46.420 --> 52:46.940]  or something.
[52:49.620 --> 52:50.660]  Every thread
[52:50.660 --> 52:52.520]  or forum, I don't even know how to describe them.
[52:52.520 --> 52:54.440]  I try to wade into
[52:54.440 --> 52:55.260]  I get excited about.
[52:55.380 --> 52:58.760]  I try to go on the sports one and then I was so overwhelmed
[52:58.760 --> 53:00.500]  with all the different conversations
[53:00.500 --> 53:02.400]  and everybody seemed to know so much more about sports
[53:02.400 --> 53:02.720]  than I did.
[53:02.800 --> 53:06.760]  I quietly lurk a lot in the Discord
[53:06.760 --> 53:08.700]  and every once in a while I get brave enough to type something.
[53:09.240 --> 53:10.580]  I feel like our community feels
[53:10.580 --> 53:12.600]  like early internet fun again.
[53:12.800 --> 53:14.520]  It's got such cool energy.
[53:15.000 --> 53:15.860]  It really does.
[53:16.360 --> 53:18.400]  It's awesome. You know what isn't awesome?
[53:18.580 --> 53:20.500]  It's the Canucks. They're not great.
[53:20.500 --> 53:21.680]  I'm stressed.
[53:22.640 --> 53:24.040]  What's the series at right now?
[53:24.340 --> 53:26.120]  2-2. Game 5. Tonight.
[53:28.680 --> 53:29.440]  I'm nervous.
[53:30.160 --> 53:32.560]  But what I am excited about in the realm of sports
[53:32.560 --> 53:34.400]  I really want to do this with you guys
[53:34.400 --> 53:36.440]  because I do it as part of my fantasy football league
[53:36.440 --> 53:37.300]  every year.
[53:38.380 --> 53:40.820]  I want us to get all in on the Scripps National Spelling Bee
[53:40.820 --> 53:42.120]  when it starts up.
[53:42.560 --> 53:43.780]  It's two weeks away.
[53:44.160 --> 53:46.480]  Pick a kid? I want us to pick a kid.
[53:46.600 --> 53:47.840]  I want us to watch it together.
[53:47.840 --> 53:49.440]  It gets intense
[53:49.440 --> 53:51.760]  in a way that you would not anticipate
[53:51.760 --> 53:53.760]  when you have a kid on the line.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.360]  Can we auction the kids?
[53:56.160 --> 53:56.660]  Uh...
[53:58.300 --> 53:58.940]  No.
[53:59.960 --> 54:02.000]  I mean, we could
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.660]  but probably not a great idea.
[54:04.300 --> 54:04.640]  20.
[54:07.240 --> 54:07.880]  No.
[54:08.980 --> 54:09.720]  We're not actually
[54:09.720 --> 54:10.900]  purchasing the children.
[54:12.360 --> 54:14.120]  Oh, oh, oh.
[54:14.280 --> 54:15.960]  I thought we were actually illegally
[54:15.960 --> 54:16.380]  going to
[54:16.380 --> 54:19.360]  buy them and then steal them.
[54:19.860 --> 54:21.080]  Is this not online?
[54:21.640 --> 54:24.040]  An auction draft like the Summer League
[54:24.040 --> 54:24.360]  is what it is.
[54:24.360 --> 54:27.920]  I already feel like doing
[54:27.920 --> 54:29.720]  the Spelling Bee and doing content
[54:29.720 --> 54:31.900]  around it is like walking such
[54:31.900 --> 54:34.020]  a fine line. I feel weird about it
[54:34.020 --> 54:36.220]  already. You don't think a video before that
[54:36.220 --> 54:37.640]  called the kid auction?
[54:37.680 --> 54:39.060]  But it's public.
[54:39.860 --> 54:41.680]  It wouldn't be anything that they're not already projecting.
[54:41.680 --> 54:43.200]  So you're saying you don't want to illegally
[54:43.200 --> 54:45.360]  auction and traffic the kids
[54:45.360 --> 54:45.940]  is what you're saying?
[54:47.580 --> 54:49.280]  Do you think my
[54:49.280 --> 54:51.400]  issue with it is that it's public or private?
[54:51.800 --> 54:53.320]  I'm saying
[54:53.320 --> 54:55.440]  I understand that it feels weird
[54:55.440 --> 54:57.360]  but we're not doing anything that they're
[54:57.360 --> 54:58.540]  not already doing.
[54:58.780 --> 55:00.760]  That didn't help at all, dude.
[55:01.320 --> 55:02.600]  That didn't help at all.
[55:02.820 --> 55:04.180]  What are you saying?
[55:04.760 --> 55:06.040]  Because you have to
[55:07.260 --> 55:09.400]  we have to pick our kids,
[55:09.520 --> 55:10.580]  right? We have to evaluate.
[55:10.580 --> 55:12.620]  That's the problem!
[55:15.400 --> 55:16.200]  You're saying
[55:16.200 --> 55:18.700]  that I have a problem with the start.
[55:19.500 --> 55:20.660]  This is gonna be
[55:20.660 --> 55:22.360]  like the movie league all over again.
[55:22.500 --> 55:24.540]  You're like, I don't know about this.
[55:24.920 --> 55:26.380]  And then as soon as we're done,
[55:26.660 --> 55:28.720]  you're gonna be like, that was so fucking
[55:28.720 --> 55:30.520]  fun. I can't wait for next year.
[55:30.720 --> 55:32.740]  I can't wait to do this. I'm all
[55:32.740 --> 55:34.700]  in on this. It's the most wholesome
[55:34.700 --> 55:36.720]  thing ever but unfortunately
[55:36.720 --> 55:38.560]  described in the most Andrew way
[55:38.560 --> 55:40.540]  possible. So if we can get the
[55:40.540 --> 55:42.560]  regulation kid auction on the calendar, that
[55:42.560 --> 55:44.740]  would be great. Listen, that's all Gavin.
[55:45.100 --> 55:46.240]  What I'm advising
[55:46.900 --> 55:48.860]  is supporting spelling culture
[55:48.860 --> 55:50.560]  which is important. Education.
[55:51.260 --> 55:52.500]  Supporting, we're picking
[55:52.500 --> 55:53.900]  kids and cheering them on.
[55:54.580 --> 55:55.700]  It's not a thing where we're like
[55:56.280 --> 55:58.640]  we want this kid to fail. I might want you to
[55:58.640 --> 56:00.560]  fail, Geoff, but I want all the kids
[56:00.560 --> 56:02.420]  to do great. Just get in line, buddy.
[56:05.140 --> 56:06.120]  It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[56:06.120 --> 56:08.080]  So how do we decide who we pick then
[56:08.080 --> 56:08.980]  if we're not auctioning?
[56:09.920 --> 56:11.980]  Typically how it goes is
[56:11.980 --> 56:13.580]  the final day they'll have like
[56:14.020 --> 56:16.060]  30 kids and then I'll post
[56:16.060 --> 56:17.360]  a list and then we can all just pick.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.020]  But what if I want you to pick?
[56:19.540 --> 56:21.920]  We'll do it in order. We'll find some way to do it.
[56:22.620 --> 56:23.500]  And when
[56:23.960 --> 56:26.340]  does this happen? It's like
[56:26.340 --> 56:28.180]  May 28th.
[56:28.240 --> 56:29.960]  I think it's like 13 days
[56:29.960 --> 56:30.580]  away or something.
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.940]  Did you want to record this
[56:33.940 --> 56:35.860]  or stream it or what? I think
[56:35.860 --> 56:37.880]  record would probably be
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.420]  the best. It's probably safer, huh?
[56:40.000 --> 56:40.280]  Yeah.
[56:41.260 --> 56:44.060]  With how Eric is nervous about it, I think
[56:44.060 --> 56:45.240]  record is the way to go.
[56:46.100 --> 56:46.940]  Give it out.
[56:47.560 --> 56:49.540]  Yeah, what kids are we betting on?
[56:49.600 --> 56:51.320]  Their horses is really
[56:51.880 --> 56:53.740]  that's the issue. You know what I mean?
[56:54.340 --> 56:55.760]  I mean there probably is betting
[56:55.760 --> 56:58.020]  for it. That doesn't
[56:58.020 --> 56:59.400]  make it okay.
[57:00.460 --> 57:01.800]  What doesn't make
[57:01.800 --> 57:03.580]  what is the issue with child
[57:03.580 --> 57:05.540]  Geoff, am I insane?
[57:06.480 --> 57:07.740]  I feel so
[57:07.740 --> 57:09.500]  uncomfortable in this conversation.
[57:09.740 --> 57:11.860]  I'm just trying to figure out how to cut
[57:11.860 --> 57:13.120]  it out and keep the episode.
[57:13.480 --> 57:15.880]  I recognize
[57:15.880 --> 57:17.320]  these talented
[57:17.320 --> 57:19.020]  athlete spellers
[57:19.700 --> 57:21.960]  performing their craft and I want to
[57:21.960 --> 57:23.860]  honor and respect it at the highest
[57:23.860 --> 57:25.760]  of levels. And maybe win a little money
[57:25.760 --> 57:26.560]  on the side. Yeah.
[57:26.680 --> 57:29.580]  No money has
[57:29.580 --> 57:30.560]  ever been won.
[57:31.420 --> 57:33.700]  Your draft order. You get to pick your draft order
[57:33.700 --> 57:35.420]  based on how well you do. That's how I do it
[57:35.420 --> 57:37.600]  in our league. But we'll figure out something
[57:37.600 --> 57:39.640]  else. Maybe we have to
[57:39.640 --> 57:41.560]  do a draft. Like a
[57:41.560 --> 57:43.480]  football league or something. That'd be fun.
[57:44.460 --> 57:45.700]  I'm not against that.
[57:46.460 --> 57:47.820]  I'd like to do like a giant
[57:47.820 --> 57:49.500]  elimination pool type thing.
[57:49.680 --> 57:51.700]  I think that would be fun. You want to eliminate a bunch
[57:51.700 --> 57:52.880]  of kids? No.
[57:53.160 --> 57:54.320]  We're talking about football.
[57:55.560 --> 57:57.520]  Unrelated. So you want to eliminate a bunch of
[57:57.520 --> 57:59.140]  footballs? Yeah.
[57:59.360 --> 58:01.640]  I want to kill all of them. Deflate them.
[58:02.140 --> 58:02.980]  Get rid of them.
[58:03.960 --> 58:04.720]  No more.
[58:05.380 --> 58:07.660]  And by that I mean Gavin's dumb sport
[58:07.660 --> 58:09.560]  with the kicking. Not the real
[58:10.300 --> 58:10.740]  NFL.
[58:11.480 --> 58:13.820]  It's not my sport. It is your sport.
[58:14.180 --> 58:15.580]  It's the most popular sport
[58:15.580 --> 58:17.560]  on the whole planet. It's the world's
[58:17.560 --> 58:19.380]  sport. Gavin,
[58:19.540 --> 58:21.560]  if you had to pick a sport that was your sport, what would you
[58:21.560 --> 58:23.760]  pick? Cricket.
[58:24.360 --> 58:25.440]  That's what I thought too.
[58:25.440 --> 58:27.520]  I thought you'd be a cricket guy. I kicked your ass
[58:27.520 --> 58:29.080]  at that, so it's my sport.
[58:29.460 --> 58:30.620]  Get the fuck out of here.
[58:33.460 --> 58:35.580]  We should play a rugby game. That's also
[58:35.580 --> 58:36.100]  my sport.
[58:37.180 --> 58:39.480]  I used to have to play that at school. How bullshit is that?
[58:41.360 --> 58:41.720]  Rugby?
[58:42.060 --> 58:43.540]  Yeah, I had to wake up
[58:43.920 --> 58:45.580]  like 7 o'clock, go out in the
[58:45.580 --> 58:47.460]  rain, put on my football
[58:47.460 --> 58:49.480]  boots and just get caked in mud and then I'd just go in
[58:49.480 --> 58:51.680]  the rest of the day and do English
[58:51.680 --> 58:53.120]  and math covered in mud all day.
[58:53.120 --> 58:55.000]  It was bullshit. We had to do the same shit
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.280]  I had to play football and gym and do the same
[58:57.280 --> 58:59.100]  shit. Eh, I feel like America
[58:59.100 --> 59:01.200]  has showers at the schools. Oh yeah,
[59:01.300 --> 59:02.460]  you didn't get to take showers?
[59:02.820 --> 59:05.060]  We had them, but they'd all been, they were always
[59:05.060 --> 59:06.820]  taped off. I don't think they wanted
[59:08.000 --> 59:08.880]  kids showering.
[59:09.660 --> 59:11.100]  They wanted dirty little kids running
[59:11.100 --> 59:11.980]  around? Yeah.
[59:13.300 --> 59:14.900]  And then Andrew would bet on them?
[59:15.180 --> 59:17.020]  What happened? I don't
[59:17.020 --> 59:19.300]  bet on them. I pick
[59:19.300 --> 59:20.660]  which one I think will win
[59:20.660 --> 59:22.420]  and then we do an order
[59:22.420 --> 59:23.060]  around it.
[59:25.640 --> 59:26.740]  I read about
[59:26.740 --> 59:28.580]  what their interests are and what their
[59:28.580 --> 59:30.640]  past felling bee records are and then
[59:30.640 --> 59:31.520]  I make a determination.
[59:33.080 --> 59:34.720]  Sometimes I'll watch the whole bee
[59:34.720 --> 59:36.640]  because you can see all of it up to the
[59:36.640 --> 59:38.680]  final and evaluate how they
[59:38.680 --> 59:39.920]  do under pressure and
[59:40.580 --> 59:42.700]  are they asking the questions or not?
[59:42.820 --> 59:44.620]  I mean, there's a whole thing. How many times have you
[59:44.620 --> 59:45.040]  done this?
[59:46.560 --> 59:48.000]  Four years probably.
[59:48.000 --> 59:49.640]  Have you ever won? Four or five?
[59:50.540 --> 59:51.860]  I don't think I have, no.
[59:51.900 --> 59:54.080]  I got real close. What's the highest your
[59:54.080 --> 59:54.860]  kid has ever placed?
[59:56.180 --> 59:58.020]  So I sort of technically won
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.000]  one year because there was a seven way tie
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  two years ago.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.160]  And I was one of the seven.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.100]  That's like being times person of the
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.040]  year that one year.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.040]  I know, but they
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.200]  ran out of stuff.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.060]  They had to change the spelling bee rules last
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.840]  year to avoid that situation
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.680]  ever happening again.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.540]  But I don't think I've ever won by myself.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.720]  I think last year I was second?
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:22.880]  Maybe or third?
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.760]  It's intense. It goes for like an hour.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:26.780]  And
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.660]  it's stressful.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.720]  But it's a lot of fun. Do you think if you closed
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.600]  your eyes, maybe you do this, you could spell
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.540]  a single one of the fucking words that you know?
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.020]  No, not at all.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.740]  We should do that. We should play
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.680]  along with instead of betting on the
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.600]  kids and see how well we do. First of all,
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.840]  not betting. Second of all,
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.680]  what's interesting is in the
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.540]  preliminary rounds, they do
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.540]  word definitions.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.780]  All of the spelling, impossible.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.420]  The word definition
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.680]  seems so much easier.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.540]  I get a lot of those, typically.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.780]  It's a multiple choice.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.380]  It'll be like, word
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.740]  definition, revolution.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.400]  What does revolution mean? Is it
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.500]  A, B, or C? And the kids
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.660]  will always get it wrong.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.120]  What's A, B, and C?
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.320]  What are my options?
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.620]  Option A is...
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.020]  It is a...
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.760]  It is a rechargeable battery
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.320]  pack that
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.680]  Gavin owns.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.480]  Option B
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.400]  is...
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.280]  It is a
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.600]  dancing video...
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.920]  Well, no, that would actually be...
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.380]  It is... Something that slowly
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.800]  spins in a circle?
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.620]  It is something that slowly spins.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.120]  Ah, it's also revolution.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.300]  It is a
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.800]  Howard Hughes airplane.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.520]  Is option B.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.240]  And option
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.540]  C would be...
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.900]  Option C
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.240]  would be like... How do you
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.360]  describe... It's like when
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.760]  you overthrow something.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.000]  Right? Like when the people are like,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.960]  enough is enough. I think the kids get
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.600]  that shit wrong with those...
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.620]  That's terrible.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.000]  Listen, I didn't write that, okay?
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.480]  I just am going off of what... They should
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.040]  spend less time spelling and more time comprehending.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.780]  Goddamn. Joke's on you, I put the
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.360]  APC revolution under my desk.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.820]  I was self-conscious earlier when
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.840]  Geoff was dropping out and we had to carry a little
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.900]  bit with like Matrix Talk and like these different
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.820]  things or whatever, but I will say like the last
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.780]  eight minutes of this podcast have really been
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.740]  something else. And so I don't feel
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.760]  so bad about what was happening in the middle now.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.060]  And if you thought those eight minutes were fun,
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.620]  wait until we do it for
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.040]  90 minutes. You're going to have a fucking blast.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.740]  I'm going to go to the grocery store right after we do
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.600]  this and look for weird sodas and
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.140]  gravy in a can. I love it.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.660]  Let's wrap this one up
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.480]  and call it and then, you know,
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.900]  we'll go from there. How about that?
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.040]  Oh, I wasn't trying to end the podcast. I could go for another hour or so if you want.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.160]  Yeah, no, we're not. We're not going to do. We've already been going for about
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.540]  four, so I think we're good.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.940]  Can I ask you a question before we end?
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.940]  Absolutely. What is your
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.080]  least favorite part of our
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.660]  new business?
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.200]  It is probably
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.040]  the government
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.140]  paperwork and making sure that everything's
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.720]  filed properly. Like
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.760]  everything about it is great,
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.100]  except for, hey, don't
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.000]  forget this one. Oh, hey, did you do this one?
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.140]  Hey, this is filled out wrong. Hey, did you link
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.320]  this thing? Oh, actually, the titling
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.880]  on this one's wrong. It has to be redone.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.540]  Can anyone call the IRS?
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.040]  It's probably them.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.240]  I would say it's them. Now, I will
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.060]  say, if you ask me again in
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.720]  a year,
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.140]  it will be the thing where you guys
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.940]  go, yeah, we should do this. And then
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.980]  I have to keep going, who is we?
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.520]  We is you, though.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.960]  We is not. Here's the thing.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.720]  No, it's not. We is not me.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.320]  That's how it works.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.300]  No, no, no, that's how it worked
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.420]  previously. That's how it worked previously.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.100]  No, hang on, hang on. That's how it worked
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.040]  previously when we had people that I could
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.240]  defer to and get help from. I am
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.180]  not shouldering this burden when you guys have
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.160]  an idea. I will help put
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.160]  it together. I will not shoulder the
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.620]  burden of harebrained schemes.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:17.820]  Why not?
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.260]  I feel like I'm well
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.180]  within my right to say, no, I
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.940]  will not be doing the harebrained schemes.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.000]  I will help and facilitate.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.240]  In a year, that will be
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.180]  the issue. I vote Eric does
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.100]  producing role.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.620]  Just for the harebrained schemes.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.220]  I mean, you guys, vote
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.480]  on it all you want.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.140]  I might not make it to this time next year in
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.300]  this company. We got a fucking revolution
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.400]  on our hands. I'm simply letting
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.340]  you know where I stand.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.100]  No harebrained
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.280]  schemes. I'm fine
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.660]  with harebrained schemes.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.140]  When I say who is us
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.280]  and you say us is you. No, it's not.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.300]  If us
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.900]  isn't you, it's surely
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.100]  on you to make an us
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.460]  of other people.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.940]  Who are we?
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.200]  See, this is why
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.760]  I won't make it to this time next year.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.080]  Eric, as your temporary boss,
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.460]  I'm going to have to insist that you
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:18.980]  stay out of your contract for at least another year.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.260]  I'm telling
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.340]  you right now, because if this is the way that it goes,
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.300]  it ain't going this way. It's going to be
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.340]  bad. Alright, let's take a vote on it.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.300]  Vote on it all you want. Is it going to go
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.860]  good or bad? Is it going to go good or bad?
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.620]  I vote good.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.160]  I vote bad.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.180]  Eric votes bad. He wants it to go bad.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.300]  I'm sorry, Nick voted good. I'm simply letting you know
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.140]  what's going to happen.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.260]  We just voted on good.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.480]  Andrew? He didn't vote.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.240]  Good or bad?
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.460]  Andrew's like, I'm spelling the kids.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.300]  Nevermind. Good or bad?
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:52.640]  Is it going to go good or bad?
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.560]  4-1.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.760]  The only one who seems to want this to go bad is you, Eric.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.600]  I certainly don't want it to go bad.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:05:59.600]  Oh, then we're set.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.980]  So where do you
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.520]  fall on the whole weird shit in a can
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.700]  bit, harebrained scheme?
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.140]  We can put that together,
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.840]  but it's not just me.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.300]  That's what I'm telling you in this whole thing.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.240]  When it's us, and it's your
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.460]  idea, it's not...
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:18.840]  I'm not going to pick up that ball
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.540]  and run with it 100% of the time.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.580]  I will absolutely help to facilitate
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.720]  and do this stuff,
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.320]  but I'm not going to listen to every half-baked
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.460]  idea in the show and do it
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.040]  automatically.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.080]  So you're saying you'll have a hand
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.140]  on a shared ball?
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.300]  Yeah, absolutely. Yes.
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.660]  Because when it is
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.240]  we should do this, I'm saying who is we?
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.360]  We has to be the person who had
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.200]  the idea or someone else stepping up
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.260]  and me, and I can help guide
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.280]  this thing and make this all happen, but I cannot
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.980]  do it all. That sounds like a
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.640]  we. Yeah.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.260]  Right, which is what makes sense
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.400]  when I say who is we, and Gavin
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.420]  says we is you, and I say
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.860]  no it's not!
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.640]  What don't you get?
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.360]  When I say we is you, I mean the ball
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.860]  has to start rolling with someone.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.600]  You can't have a we.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.220]  We is you means we is
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.600]  me, and I'm saying no it's not.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.580]  But we can't have we without
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.880]  me. That's true.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.600]  Right, but Gavin didn't say we
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.560]  is us. Gavin said we is
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.800]  you. That is what I'm
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.700]  being very deliberate
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.600]  and very clear here. We is not
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.420]  just me. But get
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.600]  the ball rolling and we'll all put hands on the
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.780]  ball. That's what I don't trust.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.540]  I need to see it and we can
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.640]  do it. Okay. Does the
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.720]  ball have an orifice?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.660]  I'd say it's got at least two.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.500]  I will
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.580]  put my hand all over that ball.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.620]  So Andrew, did you pick a kid yet or what?
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:51.660]  What?
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.700]  I feel like so far the ball
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.460]  in general has been very well shared.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.360]  We've all been doing all kinds of shit.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.320]  It's all been
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.660]  getting everything together to
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.720]  do this business and I feel really really good
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.660]  about it. We are getting to the
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.820]  point now where we are creating shows
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.360]  and content and doing this stuff
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.120]  and the
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.260]  Wacky Idea Factory begins
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.660]  and it's fun.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:21.520]  I love the
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.600]  Wacky Idea. I have no problem with the Wacky Idea
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.300]  Factory. I love it. It's a lot of fun.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.640]  But I want to make sure the Wacky Idea Factory
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.140]  isn't just Eric by himself
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.440]  trying to get the half-baked.
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.680]  I'm telling you I'm not saying
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.540]  I'm not saying
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.420]  that you guys have let anything drop.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.400]  I'm simply saying when we
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.540]  who is that and you say it's you
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.300]  it's not just me.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.860]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.000]  Allow me to be clear.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.560]  When we have the ball
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.800]  100%
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.360]  of the time, no matter
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  whose ball it is, no matter who
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.460]  creates the ball, my fist is
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.320]  in it. So there's always
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.600]  going to be at least a me
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.400]  with the ball so anybody else that touches
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.620]  the ball or inserts anything into the
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.480]  ball, it becomes a we. But there's
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.580]  always going to be a me involved in this ball
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.620]  guys. I'm fisting it hard all day long.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.580]  So don't ever feel like it's just going to be you
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.620]  because it can't only be you because I'm
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.280]  already in there.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.840]  I'm going to touch every ball.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.600]  That's great. I'm
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.600]  super into that. I'm not good at starting the
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.640]  movement of the ball. I can provide the
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.400]  ball. Yes. Right.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.720]  Right. But it can't be a full
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.300]  handoff. That's what I'm saying.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.560]  Is that it can't be, well, I had
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.340]  the idea. Now, Eric, you take care of it.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.420]  But it's never like that. It's not like, hey,
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.520]  you make this content. I'm not
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.560]  saying that.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.580]  I'm saying when I asked, who's
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.440]  we? You said we
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.500]  is you. That is what this
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.540]  whole conversation is. Please
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.720]  understand that I agree with everything
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.700]  you guys are saying right now. I'm
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.580]  saying that when I asked, you
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.620]  said we is you. And I said, no
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.260]  it's not. That's all.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.660]  Well, I think technically you are a
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.620]  part of we. So it's you
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.700]  plus. That is not
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.640]  what was said. Because don't forget
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.760]  I'm in the ball. Right now.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:10.800]  Knuckles wet.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.460]  Now, I get it. And I think this was a good
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.740]  conversation to have. And I'm glad that we had
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.000]  it.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.520]  I feel like we should resolve
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.960]  all these conflicts in episode.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.580]  I'm totally into that. I have no
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.180]  problem with that. Was this a conflict?
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.600]  No, not at all. But it's as close
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.600]  to a conflict as we typically get.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.580]  I just like the visual of
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580]  we're all in the hairbrain factory looking at
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.160]  the window and there's a whole
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.640]  Patreon waiting outside. And I'm excited
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:38.200]  about it.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.360]  We gotta deliver.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.640]  We do gotta deliver. Now, before we
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.380]  had this conversation, in my head, the
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.560]  hairbrain factory was
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.500]  four people looking down at
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.200]  one factory worker, me,
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.720]  to a whole bunch of people on the outside.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.640]  Yeah, you saw it as you're down on the
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.500]  floor and we're all up on like a gantry with
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:58.820]  clipboards. Uh-huh, yes.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.920]  Eric, you've also got a clipboard.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.860]  You also have a clipboard. Oh, cool, great.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.560]  You've got a lab coat just like us.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.940]  Eric's just like slamming his clipboard
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:08.760]  into the ground.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.080]  Kicking it across the floor.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.640]  This factory
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.260]  sucks!
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.580]  Oh, man.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.620]  It's the very fucking best, isn't it?
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.620]  Like having you said, now we have to deliver.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.940]  I'm so excited to deliver.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.480]  I'm very excited. It's the fun part.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480]  It is the
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.580]  best kind of positive pressure
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.280]  I can ever...
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.580]  It's almost like...
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.560]  It's... I don't want to turn it into pee talk,
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.680]  but it's really great. I really love...
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.620]  I love just knowing
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:40.780]  that I have to deliver.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.280]  I feel like we've got balls coming out of our anus right now.
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.560]  Yeah, we do. I've got so many balls, I don't know where to put
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.260]  them all. They're in my mouth.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.360]  I'm just like juggling balls in my mouth, because
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.220]  where else am I going to put them? It's true.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.520]  Alright, why don't you go ahead and do the outro. Let's get out of here.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.460]  Hey, thanks for listening to another
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.600]  episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.320]  If you wanted to,
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.420]  I don't know, tell a friend or a
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.380]  co-worker or a family member about
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.620]  a really fun, family-friendly, safe
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.540]  to say podcast, you could
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.460]  use this one, for instance, Regulation
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.100]  Podcast. I think that they might be
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.180]  highly entertained. Everybody
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.340]  has at one point in their life
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.400]  thought to themselves, how much money would I
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.360]  pay to shoot a horse between the eyes?
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.500]  And those
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.320]  are the kind of themes that we explore
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.480]  in a fun, family-friendly way. But you
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.440]  know that because you've already listened to it. I'm just trying to give you
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.380]  selling points for all the people that you're going to turn on
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.640]  to the podcast. Thanks for listening, and check out our Patreon
