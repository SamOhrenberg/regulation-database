[00:00.000 --> 00:03.540]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.860 --> 00:04.620]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:04.700 --> 00:07.920]  With me, as always, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Free
[00:07.920 --> 00:10.280]  in that order of importance and popularity.
[00:10.480 --> 00:11.860]  This is episode four.
[00:12.740 --> 00:13.200]  Hi, guys.
[00:13.680 --> 00:17.260]  Oh, wait, I mean, that's just factually correct.
[00:17.500 --> 00:19.100]  First of all, sorry, Gavin, go ahead.
[00:19.560 --> 00:22.580]  Well, I heard the popularity part after I realized
[00:22.580 --> 00:24.340]  I wasn't paying attention to the order of the names.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.360]  It was you then me.
[00:26.520 --> 00:28.160]  It was just him stating
[00:28.860 --> 00:32.780]  the guy with a huge slow motion YouTube channel on the side
[00:32.780 --> 00:37.400]  is bigger than the piss boy Vancouver child kicker.
[00:37.440 --> 00:38.760]  Who would predict?
[00:40.020 --> 00:42.980]  More popular in every metric, Geoff said that as a dig.
[00:43.060 --> 00:44.320]  It's just a fact.
[00:44.840 --> 00:46.540]  But on this podcast, you're the most popular.
[00:46.980 --> 00:48.840]  I don't think that's true.
[00:48.960 --> 00:51.080]  Well, if we go by an egg, I'm first.
[00:51.180 --> 00:55.300]  But I think that's the only measuring system in which I'm ahead of everybody.
[00:55.300 --> 00:56.620]  I'll be honest.
[00:56.700 --> 00:59.340]  The gaslighting is so intense and immediate.
[00:59.560 --> 01:01.160]  I don't remember what I said now.
[01:02.680 --> 01:04.140]  Oh, you went Gavin than me?
[01:04.720 --> 01:06.120]  I'm pretty sure I didn't.
[01:06.320 --> 01:07.300]  I'm pretty sure I went the other way.
[01:07.360 --> 01:08.200]  But now I got me.
[01:08.260 --> 01:09.380]  Now you've got me confused.
[01:09.840 --> 01:11.140]  I'm locked in.
[01:12.020 --> 01:13.980]  I thought I was bottom, but I couldn't.
[01:14.140 --> 01:15.260]  International superstar.
[01:15.960 --> 01:17.900]  Oh, I have Gavin free.
[01:18.940 --> 01:24.120]  I have a running list in my head at all times of the order of popularity
[01:24.120 --> 01:25.380]  of you to me.
[01:25.580 --> 01:27.800]  And I'm pretty sure Andrew's above Gavin right now.
[01:27.920 --> 01:28.720]  So I think I.
[01:29.120 --> 01:30.460]  I don't think that's true at all.
[01:30.520 --> 01:31.660]  I think I said his name first.
[01:32.020 --> 01:32.980]  I disagree strongly.
[01:33.280 --> 01:35.240]  But, you know, we're our wires are crossed.
[01:35.320 --> 01:36.160]  We haven't done this in a bit.
[01:36.420 --> 01:37.060]  It's been a while.
[01:37.420 --> 01:39.200]  Yeah, I'm a little jet lagged.
[01:39.380 --> 01:39.840]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40.260 --> 01:41.580]  Well, you're all home, though, right?
[01:41.620 --> 01:43.020]  Did you get you get some sleep last night?
[01:43.480 --> 01:44.540]  Yeah, but I was so tired.
[01:44.600 --> 01:47.400]  I fell asleep and like died that I woke up at four.
[01:47.520 --> 01:49.060]  So this feels like really late.
[01:49.440 --> 01:51.360]  It feels like we're recording at normal time.
[01:51.420 --> 01:52.300]  You've been up since four?
[01:52.300 --> 01:55.100]  Yeah, also, it's weird
[01:55.100 --> 01:57.000]  because we're recording at a different time on a different day.
[01:57.120 --> 01:58.280]  So everything's just out of whack.
[01:58.480 --> 01:59.380]  It's all fucked.
[01:59.840 --> 02:00.880]  Who are we blaming for that? Me?
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.500]  Yeah, that's your fault.
[02:02.620 --> 02:03.220]  That's all right.
[02:04.060 --> 02:05.880]  Yeah, I think I wouldn't even say fault.
[02:06.500 --> 02:09.440]  However, had you not been out of town on a trip,
[02:09.460 --> 02:10.880]  I would have had to reschedule today.
[02:11.060 --> 02:12.560]  So then it would have been my fault.
[02:13.420 --> 02:15.320]  So I guess it would have been scot free.
[02:15.500 --> 02:16.620]  Why did you even say anything?
[02:16.720 --> 02:18.460]  I guess I could have been.
[02:18.680 --> 02:21.120]  No one would have known because I'm trying to make a comedy podcast here.
[02:21.660 --> 02:22.600]  I would have been second.
[02:22.680 --> 02:24.220]  I guess I'm secondarily responsible.
[02:24.420 --> 02:28.560]  Like if you're unable to fill your duties of irresponsibility, I would step up.
[02:28.740 --> 02:31.860]  I feel like honesty is important and it makes you popular.
[02:32.020 --> 02:35.220]  And I think that you could potentially now be the most popular
[02:35.220 --> 02:36.180]  member of this podcast.
[02:36.500 --> 02:38.740]  Wow. That's very sweet of you to say.
[02:38.820 --> 02:39.600]  But I don't know.
[02:39.660 --> 02:43.000]  Going up against such heavyweights is the Canadian and the Brit.
[02:43.080 --> 02:43.840]  I don't know, man.
[02:45.660 --> 02:47.980]  Hard to hard to compete with with those two.
[02:48.080 --> 02:49.640]  I mean, you're saying it like it's high bar.
[02:49.640 --> 02:52.300]  I feel like it's low bar across the board.
[02:52.440 --> 02:53.320]  Oh, really? I do, too.
[02:53.460 --> 02:55.940]  I thought the sarcasm was dripping, but I guess not.
[02:56.080 --> 02:58.000]  I'm sorry. No, listen, I'm kidding.
[02:58.060 --> 02:59.440]  You just called me the Canadian.
[02:59.620 --> 03:01.320]  We don't do sarcasm. We don't do.
[03:02.760 --> 03:03.600]  It's not a thing.
[03:06.300 --> 03:07.940]  Oh, why would you do that to me?
[03:08.560 --> 03:10.480]  Oh, Gavin, how was your trip?
[03:11.260 --> 03:13.140]  Oh, it was lovely. It was nice.
[03:13.620 --> 03:15.500]  Yeah. Had a little birthday in England.
[03:16.200 --> 03:18.460]  Yeah. Oh, when's the last time you had a birthday in England?
[03:18.460 --> 03:21.340]  Oh, a few years ago, probably went to the cheese rolling.
[03:21.580 --> 03:23.120]  I know that you're a big fan of the cheese roll.
[03:23.340 --> 03:24.400]  Oh, of course. Yeah.
[03:24.440 --> 03:27.260]  I was very excited to see when you shared clips of the cheese roll.
[03:27.620 --> 03:30.100]  Was that your first time attending the cheese rolling?
[03:30.620 --> 03:34.400]  Yes. Was it as awesome as it looks?
[03:35.540 --> 03:39.040]  It's something I've realized that just doesn't come across well on camera.
[03:39.220 --> 03:42.980]  And even on my footage, that hill is frickin steep.
[03:43.560 --> 03:46.300]  Like it is so immensely steep.
[03:46.360 --> 03:47.800]  I don't know how people don't die.
[03:49.800 --> 03:51.580]  Is this now having seen it?
[03:51.700 --> 03:53.940]  Is this something that you think to yourself, like, I want to get into this?
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.600]  Like, I want to be I want to roll down that hill.
[03:56.140 --> 03:57.160]  I would love to.
[03:57.440 --> 03:58.980]  Well, how do we make that happen?
[04:00.240 --> 04:02.100]  Well, I mean, there is just the risk, like.
[04:03.180 --> 04:06.580]  You know, I feel like currently I'm responsible
[04:07.520 --> 04:11.440]  for other people's stuff, and if I break my both legs,
[04:12.340 --> 04:13.540]  then everyone suffers.
[04:14.280 --> 04:16.340]  I think you could film slow-mo in a chair.
[04:16.860 --> 04:18.040]  Yeah. Did.
[04:18.240 --> 04:19.140]  Let me ask you a question.
[04:19.560 --> 04:21.460]  Did any. You went to the cheese rolling, right?
[04:21.820 --> 04:23.240]  Yeah. And you saw the whole thing.
[04:23.780 --> 04:25.900]  Yeah. Did anybody get taken off in an ambulance?
[04:26.420 --> 04:27.520]  Not that I saw.
[04:27.740 --> 04:28.700]  But you're fine then.
[04:29.820 --> 04:33.080]  But based on some of the footage I got, I don't know how.
[04:35.240 --> 04:38.640]  Now, were you shooting this just for fun or was this a work gig?
[04:39.180 --> 04:43.440]  I was filming it for slow-mo, but I just it was after I'd already
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.620]  booked my flights home where I was like, when does that cheese roll?
[04:47.700 --> 04:48.260]  I should really try.
[04:48.420 --> 04:51.740]  And I realized it just happened to be in the middle of the week that I was home.
[04:51.880 --> 04:53.540]  So I just packed my smallest camera.
[04:54.160 --> 04:54.540]  That's awesome.
[04:54.920 --> 04:57.520]  So did you just roll up as an attendee or did you let them know
[04:57.520 --> 05:01.080]  a world famous high speed photographer, Gavin Free, will be in attendance today?
[05:01.740 --> 05:05.760]  No, I just we went there and there was a little press area
[05:05.760 --> 05:07.700]  that I thought, yeah, I've got a camera and a tripod.
[05:11.140 --> 05:11.860]  That's awesome.
[05:11.860 --> 05:14.680]  Did you run into any comment leavers or?
[05:16.580 --> 05:18.120]  He got recognized a few times.
[05:18.220 --> 05:19.520]  I don't know if. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[05:19.520 --> 05:21.160]  There was some there was some actual comment leavers there.
[05:21.280 --> 05:25.240]  And even one of the BBC guys knew of this podcast.
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.060]  Oh, that's awesome.
[05:27.800 --> 05:30.080]  Did you tell him that maybe if he knows about it,
[05:30.080 --> 05:32.360]  maybe the world should know about it and the BBC should get behind it?
[05:32.360 --> 05:32.980]  God damn it.
[05:35.460 --> 05:37.620]  Like we're making we're making fucking news here.
[05:37.640 --> 05:39.560]  I think the BBC would include us in a news post.
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.720]  We're not called fuck face anymore.
[05:42.520 --> 05:46.520]  That's all formerly previously known as.
[05:47.880 --> 05:50.200]  We should that we should start of every conversation
[05:50.200 --> 05:53.200]  with every interviewer or media person with you can talk about us now.
[05:53.400 --> 05:54.120]  It's OK.
[05:56.040 --> 05:57.940]  How long do you think until we get in Variety?
[06:00.700 --> 06:01.540]  That's the dream.
[06:02.880 --> 06:05.540]  That is the signal awards of 2024.
[06:07.140 --> 06:09.540]  Yeah, but don't you kind of not want to be in Variety now?
[06:09.560 --> 06:12.760]  You kind of just want to be like, I'm a Hollywood reporter guy.
[06:12.880 --> 06:16.100]  Fuck Variety. No, I mean, I'll be in.
[06:16.180 --> 06:17.780]  Yeah, well, we can do the Hollywood reporter.
[06:17.980 --> 06:19.680]  We draw like a line in the sand.
[06:19.900 --> 06:22.360]  I mean, I'm not opposed to being in the Hollywood reporter as well. Right.
[06:22.860 --> 06:24.980]  Yeah, I think it's funnier if we end up in Variety.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.380]  Being I have a beef with with Hollywood press.
[06:28.540 --> 06:32.080]  It would be nice to end up in Variety for a good thing for once.
[06:34.120 --> 06:36.200]  Every time I've been in it, it is not great.
[06:36.560 --> 06:38.340]  Yeah, that's fair.
[06:38.340 --> 06:40.620]  I can understand that from your perspective
[06:41.720 --> 06:43.540]  with the cheese rolling, Gavin.
[06:43.940 --> 06:49.200]  Yeah. Did you have any temptation to like try to track down that type of cheese?
[06:49.420 --> 06:51.000]  You're like, what would you do if you won?
[06:51.440 --> 06:53.000]  How do you travel with the cheese?
[06:53.320 --> 06:54.320]  Would you bring it with you?
[06:54.600 --> 06:56.480]  Because you're kind of lucky you could leave it with family.
[06:57.000 --> 06:58.340]  I mean, if I ran the cheese roll.
[06:58.720 --> 07:00.520]  Yeah, if you ran because you win the cheese, right?
[07:00.560 --> 07:01.980]  If you yeah, on the run.
[07:02.540 --> 07:04.240]  First of all, how many runs do they do?
[07:04.300 --> 07:06.100]  Like how many cheeses do they give out?
[07:06.100 --> 07:07.480]  I saw four.
[07:08.060 --> 07:10.240]  Oh, that's a lot less than I was anticipating.
[07:10.680 --> 07:12.840]  Three men's runs and a woman's one.
[07:13.140 --> 07:14.920]  Is it all the same kind of cheese?
[07:15.800 --> 07:16.760]  I don't know.
[07:17.020 --> 07:21.180]  Honestly, the cheese was my enemy that day because I was
[07:21.180 --> 07:25.040]  I was right at the bottom of the hill, directly in the middle.
[07:25.940 --> 07:30.280]  And everyone, all the real press were hiding behind hay bales.
[07:30.780 --> 07:33.520]  And we were we were just shoved off to the side.
[07:33.520 --> 07:36.160]  All the people with real equipment were like, yeah, piss off.
[07:36.380 --> 07:37.120]  We got this spot.
[07:37.460 --> 07:38.900]  So we were just shoved over and over.
[07:39.080 --> 07:42.120]  And then like a bunch of people with GoPros and just like whoever that
[07:42.120 --> 07:44.640]  whoever that felt like it started climbing into the press area.
[07:45.200 --> 07:48.180]  So I was shoved even more further over completely
[07:49.720 --> 07:51.000]  exposed to the cheese.
[07:51.100 --> 07:54.940]  So for the first I would say for the first five seconds
[07:54.940 --> 07:59.780]  of the 10 second cheese roll, I was just trying not to be killed by cheese.
[07:59.780 --> 08:03.540]  Oh, because it comes cooking down that hill.
[08:03.640 --> 08:05.580]  So I would just be watching the cheese.
[08:05.700 --> 08:07.940]  And then after it missed me, I would start filming.
[08:08.860 --> 08:12.060]  Hey, Nick, there's about seven sound drops in there.
[08:12.220 --> 08:14.560]  If you could pull those out, they're all gold.
[08:14.760 --> 08:16.140]  Oh, yeah, you got it.
[08:16.300 --> 08:17.040]  Thank you. What happened?
[08:17.800 --> 08:19.280]  No, you just said a lot of really awesome stuff.
[08:19.360 --> 08:22.620]  Oh, yeah. Well, we should isolate and hold on to forever.
[08:23.880 --> 08:25.220]  One more thing about the cheese thing.
[08:25.320 --> 08:27.940]  What was the craziest thing that you saw at the cheese thing?
[08:28.460 --> 08:30.540]  Um, well, a lot of drunk people.
[08:31.360 --> 08:33.880]  Yeah, I assume. I feel like that goes with it.
[08:34.260 --> 08:37.900]  I just saw so many necks get real bent up.
[08:40.640 --> 08:42.780]  One one guy was great, too.
[08:42.860 --> 08:45.920]  He face planted so hard, both of his shoes flew off.
[08:46.220 --> 08:49.900]  Did you see? Did you see like scorpion after scorpion?
[08:50.100 --> 08:51.000]  Oh, yeah. Some of them.
[08:51.460 --> 08:54.640]  Some of those awkward looking scorpions I've ever seen in my life.
[08:54.940 --> 08:57.080]  Like scorpions on the move while twisting.
[08:57.940 --> 09:02.520]  On a scale of one to ten for fun, where did it land?
[09:03.060 --> 09:04.320]  Oh, to watch? Yeah.
[09:04.740 --> 09:06.500]  Like a nine. Wow.
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.540]  Should we make it a regulation event and maybe go next year or sometime in the future?
[09:12.000 --> 09:13.200]  Do you think it's worth us doing that?
[09:13.600 --> 09:16.000]  Yeah, but it's like it's not really an organized event anymore.
[09:16.220 --> 09:18.320]  It's more of just like a bunch of people.
[09:18.580 --> 09:18.960]  I can't be right.
[09:19.360 --> 09:21.340]  Like they crack down on it being organized.
[09:21.620 --> 09:23.260]  I mean, I feel like that's better.
[09:23.540 --> 09:26.700]  You know, I feel like that's what you want when nobody's in charge
[09:26.700 --> 09:28.760]  and nobody takes responsibility.
[09:29.160 --> 09:30.760]  That's when the real fun shit happens.
[09:31.300 --> 09:33.160]  Yeah, it is truly a shit show.
[09:33.480 --> 09:36.080]  And we've got to get there early if we're going to make a thing of it.
[09:36.680 --> 09:38.400]  How do you figure out when it is?
[09:38.720 --> 09:40.140]  It's pretty public still, right?
[09:40.220 --> 09:42.020]  Like it's just just look it up.
[09:42.380 --> 09:45.560]  Yeah, it's not like they're fucking spray painting cheese to the wall
[09:45.560 --> 09:48.240]  and like you got to crack the code where it is.
[09:48.260 --> 09:49.520]  Like it's an espionage film.
[09:49.840 --> 09:52.380]  Yeah, I love cheese.
[09:52.380 --> 09:56.820]  Oh, my God, I'm sorry I just made myself laugh.
[09:57.220 --> 10:00.000]  That was good, right? I love cheese.
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.280]  If you're 100 years old, you'll remember the Halo 2 ARG?
[10:03.440 --> 10:03.820]  I love bees.
[10:03.880 --> 10:04.500]  I love bees.
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.960]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.240]  Thank you. Thank you.
[10:08.300 --> 10:08.920]  How was your birthday?
[10:09.400 --> 10:10.060]  You have fun?
[10:10.480 --> 10:12.340]  Yeah, uneventful. Uneventful.
[10:12.600 --> 10:14.340]  We made birthday content for you.
[10:14.480 --> 10:15.540]  I'm excited for you to say.
[10:15.900 --> 10:17.840]  Is that why you all just started texting me?
[10:17.900 --> 10:19.660]  How like that was a great guy.
[10:20.020 --> 10:21.120]  Still hasn't responded.
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.020]  Uh, it was your birthday and we were just trying to wish you well.
[10:25.580 --> 10:26.600]  Thought it would be nice.
[10:27.600 --> 10:30.300]  Yeah, it was just all at the same time and also Nick text me,
[10:30.380 --> 10:31.220]  which I don't think has ever happened.
[10:37.400 --> 10:42.120]  There maybe was a conversation about how when you are, uh,
[10:42.420 --> 10:45.320]  when you're told that you're a great guy, you respond instantly.
[10:45.620 --> 10:49.580]  And I still haven't technically received a response from that text.
[10:49.580 --> 10:52.720]  I don't think I replied to you individually.
[10:53.440 --> 10:53.760]  No.
[10:54.600 --> 10:57.540]  I would just watch the video if I were you.
[10:57.540 --> 11:00.900]  Yeah, it's a lot of us just sharing our feelings about you
[11:00.900 --> 11:03.540]  and celebrating you and how much we love you
[11:03.540 --> 11:07.740]  and talking about how great you are and all the things that make you, you.
[11:08.120 --> 11:08.600]  Yeah.
[11:09.560 --> 11:10.880]  I think you're going to enjoy it a lot.
[11:11.380 --> 11:11.580]  Yeah.
[11:12.240 --> 11:16.580]  This is so like, it sounds so like dastardly.
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.440]  Yeah, I feel very uneasy.
[11:19.580 --> 11:25.460]  I don't know why you're going to get like a 45 minute expression of love
[11:25.460 --> 11:29.660]  of the three best friends and then the guy who's never texted you before.
[11:33.560 --> 11:36.120]  You, uh, you said you're feeling uneasy.
[11:36.320 --> 11:39.560]  I had an all time uneasy moment the other day,
[11:39.560 --> 11:45.600]  and I've realized that I need to be more, um, when I when I'm doing actions,
[11:45.600 --> 11:48.280]  I need to think them through further.
[11:48.520 --> 11:48.920]  No, you don't.
[11:48.920 --> 11:49.540]  I can't.
[11:49.880 --> 11:50.660]  No, you what?
[11:50.720 --> 11:51.460]  No, hold on.
[11:51.500 --> 11:52.180]  No, no, no.
[11:52.820 --> 11:54.300]  Where did you get that in your head?
[11:54.560 --> 11:55.880]  Well, OK, well, what?
[11:56.560 --> 11:58.780]  Typically, I'll be doing like three or four things at once,
[11:58.780 --> 12:02.720]  and then I'll just go solution to problem, do do solution
[12:02.720 --> 12:07.500]  and then not fully think about the potential consequences of said thing.
[12:07.940 --> 12:12.800]  It was I was sitting at my desk and I was I was like updating something
[12:12.800 --> 12:15.600]  or a page rampage, and I was looking at something for a game.
[12:16.300 --> 12:20.280]  And I realized, oh, I hadn't taken my anxiety medicine for the day.
[12:20.360 --> 12:21.360]  I take like one pill a day.
[12:21.800 --> 12:22.780]  This is like I need to take it.
[12:23.220 --> 12:25.200]  But all of the things on my desk were empty.
[12:25.260 --> 12:28.860]  All of the like beverages I had outside of one.
[12:29.100 --> 12:31.500]  So I went, oh, I'll just I'll drink this one with my pill.
[12:31.740 --> 12:32.880]  And so I put the pill in my mouth.
[12:33.120 --> 12:38.480]  Then I took a drink and I forgot that that beverage contained boba balls in it.
[12:38.540 --> 12:40.020]  So I have a pill in my mouth.
[12:40.020 --> 12:46.020]  And then all of a sudden, there is like 15 boba pearls in my mouth.
[12:46.280 --> 12:50.540]  And I go into full panic mode because how am I going to swallow all of this?
[12:50.980 --> 12:54.640]  It's just feel basically put like a bunch of other pills in your mouth.
[12:54.800 --> 12:56.320]  Yeah, it was with pills.
[12:56.920 --> 13:02.860]  It was a massive amount of just so circular balls in my.
[13:03.060 --> 13:07.500]  That is an unfortunate combination of words, but it is what all balls are circular.
[13:08.060 --> 13:14.440]  Yeah, well, I panicked and I tried to crush all the balls in my mouth and my tongue.
[13:15.620 --> 13:21.800]  And that resulted in me missing and then me accidentally swallowing.
[13:22.020 --> 13:24.460]  And then the pill is melting at the same time.
[13:24.580 --> 13:27.840]  So I thought I'll just try again, but I'll lift the straw up higher.
[13:27.840 --> 13:29.500]  But that still didn't work.
[13:29.540 --> 13:34.500]  So I ended up just having to swallow like four boba pearls alongside my pill.
[13:34.860 --> 13:36.740]  And it was just complete chaos.
[13:36.740 --> 13:41.380]  It was a very relaxed time to all of a sudden instant panic.
[13:41.900 --> 13:45.940]  Did the size of the straw not give away what kind of beverage it was going to be?
[13:46.580 --> 13:50.900]  The fact I ordered it gave away what type of beverage it was going to be.
[13:51.020 --> 13:52.780]  The issue was I just wasn't thinking.
[13:53.600 --> 13:56.620]  Now, I would know you explain that story to us just now.
[13:57.800 --> 14:05.020]  And what I heard was a perfectly reasonable interaction that went the way it should have.
[14:05.020 --> 14:07.000]  What you're describing is how that should have gone.
[14:07.220 --> 14:09.860]  I don't know why you would want to change your line of thought,
[14:10.020 --> 14:12.500]  because I feel like everything that you just explained makes...
[14:13.560 --> 14:15.480]  The universe wanted it to happen that way.
[14:15.900 --> 14:17.420]  And we want to make the universe happy.
[14:18.060 --> 14:23.220]  I don't know if I can convey the genuine level of shock
[14:23.220 --> 14:26.440]  when all the boba pearls flew into my mouth on that first sip.
[14:26.700 --> 14:28.280]  That was supposed to happen.
[14:28.600 --> 14:30.000]  We needed that to happen.
[14:30.300 --> 14:32.780]  For balance, the universe needed that to happen.
[14:32.940 --> 14:34.360]  Please don't take that away from us.
[14:34.920 --> 14:35.820]  I'm not going to.
[14:36.220 --> 14:38.400]  I've been capable of changing in that way.
[14:38.500 --> 14:40.340]  But it was a moment of God damn it.
[14:40.360 --> 14:41.140]  I wish...
[14:41.140 --> 14:44.100]  I wish I just thought this through a little bit more.
[14:44.380 --> 14:46.740]  I wish I didn't just drink the drink.
[14:47.020 --> 14:49.200]  I wish I got up, got a new glass of water.
[14:50.060 --> 14:52.380]  But instead, now I have all these pearls in my mouth.
[14:52.560 --> 14:55.080]  And it started to melt in my mouth, the pill.
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.580]  I'm very thankful it was like a lemonade boba type thing because it covered up.
[14:59.740 --> 15:02.520]  But I could, you know, like when a pill lasts too long in your mouth
[15:02.520 --> 15:04.080]  and you start to taste it and it's terrible.
[15:04.360 --> 15:05.500]  It always tastes the worst.
[15:05.620 --> 15:06.360]  It was that.
[15:06.540 --> 15:08.700]  But I thankfully had a mask.
[15:08.880 --> 15:11.520]  I feel like I'm usually a new drink guy anyway.
[15:11.740 --> 15:15.720]  Like if if a glass of water has been out all night, it goes all old.
[15:16.460 --> 15:18.600]  Yeah, I always assume.
[15:19.300 --> 15:23.640]  I always assume that if I leave like a glass of water out overnight while I'm asleep,
[15:24.140 --> 15:26.560]  cockroaches and bugs are going to use it as a swimming pool.
[15:28.500 --> 15:31.260]  And then in the morning, I'll be like, oh, I think it's totally fine.
[15:31.260 --> 15:34.000]  But really, like some cockroaches doing the backstroke in it.
[15:34.100 --> 15:37.760]  And maybe like maybe two drunk flies were banging like it's a hot tub.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.040]  Does it happen here?
[15:39.200 --> 15:42.920]  Because in England, I remember if you fill a glass of water the night before,
[15:42.960 --> 15:45.340]  the next morning is going to be all full of bubbles and taste weird.
[15:46.060 --> 15:49.380]  And here the tap water is so fricking disgusting.
[15:49.500 --> 15:50.300]  I just don't drink it.
[15:50.400 --> 15:51.240]  Like, does it happen here, too?
[15:52.080 --> 15:53.000]  If you leave it out.
[15:53.100 --> 15:53.300]  Yeah.
[15:53.780 --> 15:54.080]  Yeah.
[15:54.320 --> 15:56.720]  Just gets all like weird and bubbly and gross.
[15:56.880 --> 15:57.980]  And I don't know if bubbly.
[15:58.020 --> 16:00.180]  I don't think I'd describe it as bubbly for me.
[16:00.180 --> 16:02.440]  Also, I don't know that I'd describe it as bubbly.
[16:02.760 --> 16:05.600]  But it gets flat and still because it gets weird.
[16:06.180 --> 16:07.180]  Yeah, it tastes weird.
[16:07.520 --> 16:08.640]  It definitely tastes off.
[16:09.300 --> 16:11.380]  It definitely tastes like it's been sitting forever.
[16:11.560 --> 16:13.940]  But you don't have the bubbles stuck to the inside of the glass?
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.680]  Does British tap water carbonate itself overnight?
[16:19.800 --> 16:20.240]  Is that what you're saying?
[16:20.240 --> 16:22.640]  I don't know what happens with it, but I'm sure if you're in England,
[16:22.720 --> 16:23.760]  you've seen it with the water.
[16:24.120 --> 16:25.880]  Just put just leave a glass of water for a day.
[16:25.920 --> 16:27.560]  And it just there's bubbles on the inside now.
[16:27.560 --> 16:28.200]  All right.
[16:28.300 --> 16:29.780]  I think what I'm imagining is bubbles.
[16:30.420 --> 16:34.420]  Maybe we all need to fill a glass of water half full and stick it somewhere in our house.
[16:35.420 --> 16:38.020]  As after this recording ends and then take a picture of it
[16:38.020 --> 16:40.220]  and then in 24 hours, come back and look at the results.
[16:40.400 --> 16:41.460]  I think that's a great idea.
[16:41.640 --> 16:44.760]  There are people listening to this right now who don't know what we're talking about.
[16:44.860 --> 16:48.760]  And there's other people fucking screaming at their phones about how.
[16:48.900 --> 16:49.600]  Yeah, bubbles.
[16:50.060 --> 16:51.120]  Yeah, the water bubbles.
[16:51.760 --> 16:52.500]  I don't.
[16:52.600 --> 16:54.160]  I just think it goes stale.
[16:54.320 --> 16:55.880]  I don't know that I've seen bubbles, right?
[16:55.880 --> 16:58.320]  You thought, wow, stale.
[16:58.400 --> 16:59.500]  I wouldn't even describe it as it.
[17:00.120 --> 17:02.400]  The taste is so bad when you leave.
[17:02.600 --> 17:05.540]  Yeah, I, I, I filter all of the water I drink here.
[17:05.600 --> 17:07.400]  And it means that the bubble thing doesn't happen.
[17:08.240 --> 17:10.880]  So typically I'm drinking my water out of a curler.
[17:11.000 --> 17:11.900]  Like I'll go get it.
[17:11.960 --> 17:12.940]  I'll drink the glass.
[17:13.060 --> 17:14.680]  It's all a singular thing.
[17:15.080 --> 17:16.620]  I don't I'm not going to leave water overnight.
[17:16.980 --> 17:22.540]  I ran into this problem when we were when we were streaming more deep into our stream.
[17:22.680 --> 17:24.340]  And I'm still trying to resolve it
[17:24.340 --> 17:29.000]  because the the bottles that I stream out of are large.
[17:29.120 --> 17:30.500]  They don't fit in the sink.
[17:30.860 --> 17:32.740]  And you're also supposed to.
[17:32.860 --> 17:35.640]  Apparently it carbonates better if it's cold.
[17:36.220 --> 17:40.660]  So the only thing I could do is if I wanted to like,
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.240]  avoid having to go downstairs to like the kitchen sink is to fill it in the bathtub.
[17:45.760 --> 17:49.880]  But I didn't want to leave it in the fridge overnight because the bubbling thing.
[17:50.200 --> 17:50.480]  Stop.
[17:52.020 --> 17:52.960]  Wait, what?
[17:52.960 --> 17:55.880]  Well, because you're drinking bathtub water.
[17:56.020 --> 17:56.980]  Well, no, because.
[17:57.300 --> 17:57.920]  Well, no.
[17:58.080 --> 18:02.760]  So I would when I'm carbonating what I'm carbonating,
[18:02.760 --> 18:06.580]  the thing doesn't fit in the sink where I get my tap water typically,
[18:07.060 --> 18:10.320]  but it does fit in the tub and it's all the same water.
[18:11.180 --> 18:12.840]  There's no difference in the water.
[18:13.060 --> 18:14.760]  He's I just don't know why he said no.
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.400]  Because no, I understand why he says no, because when you say tub water,
[18:20.400 --> 18:22.920]  you're implying you're acting like that's a different thing.
[18:23.060 --> 18:25.920]  And then got in the bathtub and then scooped the thing,
[18:26.100 --> 18:28.560]  scooped the SodaStream thing in and grabbed the water.
[18:28.960 --> 18:31.860]  And all he's doing is saying he's he's he needs the clearance
[18:31.860 --> 18:34.360]  under the tub nozzle to fill the water.
[18:34.520 --> 18:36.480]  Yeah, no, Andrew, I'm right here with you.
[18:36.540 --> 18:39.500]  And also just saying tub water is different than tap.
[18:39.500 --> 18:40.900]  It's the same thing. It's the same water.
[18:41.440 --> 18:41.820]  It's no different.
[18:41.900 --> 18:42.860]  Just it's tap water.
[18:43.160 --> 18:44.280]  It's all tap water.
[18:44.700 --> 18:46.040]  Just one comes out of a tub.
[18:46.440 --> 18:47.360]  But hot water.
[18:47.740 --> 18:48.760]  Well, I guess that depends, too.
[18:48.760 --> 18:51.720]  Like some people's hot water comes out of a tank and it's not potable.
[18:52.460 --> 18:52.820]  Oh, yeah.
[18:53.380 --> 18:55.080]  I'm not using hot water.
[18:55.140 --> 18:56.660]  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about there,
[18:56.740 --> 18:59.680]  but there's no hot water in a house in America that's not potable.
[19:00.120 --> 19:01.060]  You don't have a tank?
[19:01.760 --> 19:04.100]  Some houses have hot water tanks or we have waterless
[19:04.700 --> 19:08.240]  heating systems, but you still can drink the hot water out of your tap.
[19:09.360 --> 19:11.720]  Have you never drank the hot water out of?
[19:12.180 --> 19:13.460]  I mean, I guess when would you?
[19:14.380 --> 19:17.980]  But have you just been like avoiding hot water getting in your mouth forever here?
[19:17.980 --> 19:18.340]  Yeah.
[19:19.320 --> 19:21.460]  Well, do you take cold showers?
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.420]  I grew up with the, you know, the English taps where there's like a cold tap and a hot tap
[19:26.420 --> 19:27.200]  and they're separate taps.
[19:28.520 --> 19:30.900]  That's because you can't drink the hot one.
[19:31.840 --> 19:33.060]  Then you don't want to mix them.
[19:33.440 --> 19:36.800]  So wait, what the fuck kind of third world country is England?
[19:37.200 --> 19:40.360]  The whole time you've lived here, when you take like a hot shower,
[19:40.480 --> 19:42.480]  do you keep your mouth like so closed?
[19:43.400 --> 19:45.080]  I think, yeah, I think I have habit.
[19:45.180 --> 19:46.840]  If the water is hot, I don't do it in my mouth.
[19:48.180 --> 19:48.940]  It's so weird.
[19:49.120 --> 19:51.100]  In America, the hotter it is, the safer it is.
[19:51.200 --> 19:54.560]  That's fucking, we boil stuff to get rid of the impurities.
[19:54.800 --> 19:55.380]  Yeah, you can boil.
[19:55.840 --> 20:00.600]  You know, no one's stood in the shower sucking on a drink while they're showering.
[20:00.700 --> 20:01.540]  What are you talking about?
[20:01.560 --> 20:04.940]  No, but we're not avoiding it because we think it's not safe to drink either.
[20:05.080 --> 20:08.200]  I mean, it will get in my mouth, but I'll gauze it back out onto the floor.
[20:08.300 --> 20:09.500]  I'm not going to just be like, oh, I see it.
[20:09.520 --> 20:10.300]  I'm going to swallow it.
[20:10.620 --> 20:14.900]  The only time I've ever had to deal with non-potable water is when I was in the fucking
[20:14.900 --> 20:19.320]  deserts of Kuwait, taking a shower off the back of a truck, like a tanker truck.
[20:19.960 --> 20:21.240]  That's the only time you...
[20:21.240 --> 20:23.480]  It doesn't make its way into our homes, dude.
[20:23.880 --> 20:24.920]  Would you drink toilet water?
[20:25.360 --> 20:26.580]  Well, no, because I piss in there.
[20:26.740 --> 20:30.940]  But if the water itself is coming from the same place all the other water does,
[20:31.160 --> 20:35.880]  like if you get to it before it touches the pea sides, it's clean water.
[20:36.560 --> 20:37.720]  I've got a scenario for you, Geoff.
[20:37.980 --> 20:38.220]  Okay.
[20:38.500 --> 20:43.740]  If you had to drink the tub water of someone on this podcast, who would you take a swig of?
[20:47.420 --> 20:47.740]  Yours.
[20:48.320 --> 20:49.680]  I really don't think it matters.
[20:49.940 --> 20:51.380]  I think I would take it out of yours.
[20:51.480 --> 20:53.440]  I feel like it would bring us closer together.
[20:55.240 --> 20:56.240]  I'm quite hairy, though.
[20:56.240 --> 20:56.940]  I don't think you want mine.
[20:57.900 --> 20:58.460]  No, I don't.
[20:58.780 --> 21:00.100]  I don't think I would enjoy it anyway.
[21:00.160 --> 21:02.840]  But I would pick you just because I've known you the longest.
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.360]  It's like a tenure thing.
[21:04.740 --> 21:05.720]  Yeah, it's a tenure thing.
[21:05.800 --> 21:07.820]  I'm the most comfortable around you because of that.
[21:07.880 --> 21:12.160]  And I just feel like our friendship would have the best chance of survival after.
[21:12.820 --> 21:15.700]  Now, when you say that, Gavin, are you saying it in the context that I'm using it?
[21:15.700 --> 21:17.680]  That I'm filling my bottle with water?
[21:17.880 --> 21:20.200]  Like I'm just I'm using the tap in the tub?
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.080]  Because if so, it really doesn't matter.
[21:22.580 --> 21:22.920]  Wait, what?
[21:23.560 --> 21:26.480]  So I'm leaning in the tub, right?
[21:26.600 --> 21:28.280]  Like I twist the knob for cold water.
[21:28.780 --> 21:33.920]  And then I stand next to the tub and I put it underneath the thing where the water comes out.
[21:34.200 --> 21:35.560]  And then I fill it and I leave.
[21:36.220 --> 21:40.360]  No, you're just dunking your cup or bottle into someone's bath.
[21:40.880 --> 21:41.560]  Oh, no.
[21:41.680 --> 21:42.240]  Okay, that.
[21:42.340 --> 21:42.980]  Yeah, that's...
[21:43.340 --> 21:44.660]  Is there soap in the bath?
[21:45.220 --> 21:45.560]  No.
[21:46.360 --> 21:48.120]  Oh, but they've been in the bath.
[21:48.220 --> 21:50.020]  They just have been in without products.
[21:50.160 --> 21:50.320]  Yeah.
[21:50.680 --> 21:55.740]  But I feel like Andrews would be the strongest because he stews for longer.
[21:56.400 --> 21:56.880]  Interesting.
[21:57.240 --> 21:57.480]  Yeah.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.780]  He's overly steeped.
[22:00.020 --> 22:02.480]  Who do you think makes the least powerful water?
[22:03.820 --> 22:06.120]  Uh, probably whoever takes the quickest bath.
[22:07.300 --> 22:08.420]  Probably me, then.
[22:09.040 --> 22:10.100]  You got a speed bath?
[22:10.320 --> 22:11.560]  I got army in me.
[22:11.720 --> 22:14.380]  You know, I can't eat or bathe longer than like 30 seconds.
[22:14.380 --> 22:15.540]  I gotta get it fucking in and out.
[22:15.880 --> 22:17.720]  When was the last time you sat in a bath, Geoff?
[22:18.040 --> 22:19.300]  Like you took a bath bath.
[22:19.480 --> 22:28.100]  I took a bath maybe a month ago because I was sore and I wanted to...
[22:28.100 --> 22:29.180]  Oh, it's because of diverticulitis.
[22:29.400 --> 22:33.360]  About a month ago, I had a diverticulitis flare up and sometimes I...
[22:33.360 --> 22:36.620]  It helps to lay in the bathtub in hot water for a little while.
[22:36.720 --> 22:38.040]  So that... but before that, maybe...
[22:38.780 --> 22:40.980]  I would say I take two baths a year, maybe.
[22:41.480 --> 22:41.800]  Wow.
[22:41.800 --> 22:46.740]  And it's always like, oh, I fucking pull the muscle and I need to lay in hot water
[22:46.740 --> 22:49.340]  with epsom salt or something to relax.
[22:49.760 --> 22:51.780]  Yeah, probably no more than two a year.
[22:52.320 --> 22:55.660]  When I went into this story, I never thought it would lead into Gavin being weird.
[22:55.920 --> 22:57.720]  A Gavin weirdness being exposed.
[22:58.100 --> 23:00.040]  That was not the direction I was anticipating.
[23:00.320 --> 23:01.300]  What was I doing that was weird?
[23:01.580 --> 23:03.220]  What do you mean? Not drinking hot water?
[23:03.740 --> 23:06.080]  Avoiding all hot water, thinking it's not safe?
[23:06.680 --> 23:07.640]  That's an odd thing.
[23:08.100 --> 23:09.800]  I understand your context with it.
[23:09.800 --> 23:10.460]  It's gross, too.
[23:10.460 --> 23:14.380]  I'll drink boiled water, but just hot water.
[23:15.320 --> 23:18.340]  What's that for? Lukewarm, but like warm water?
[23:19.960 --> 23:20.800]  Tastes like shit.
[23:22.120 --> 23:24.720]  Yeah, I'm not a fan of hot beverages in general.
[23:25.300 --> 23:26.960]  I mean, I'm just... I prefer cold.
[23:28.140 --> 23:29.560]  But I just... I never thought...
[23:29.560 --> 23:30.100]  That's so weird.
[23:30.160 --> 23:33.140]  The idea that you can't drink half your water is fascinating.
[23:34.480 --> 23:36.020]  It's not that he can't drink it.
[23:36.080 --> 23:38.240]  It's that he can't drink it based on a false premise.
[23:42.100 --> 23:44.920]  What I've learned in this process is it really hurt my streaming.
[23:45.220 --> 23:48.080]  Like, I've got a lot of... I don't even know.
[23:48.160 --> 23:50.320]  Syrup, I guess, that I can mix with.
[23:50.600 --> 23:54.700]  But I haven't been doing it at the ratio because I want to try it being cold.
[23:54.980 --> 23:55.640]  But I can't.
[23:55.920 --> 23:57.320]  It takes too long to be cold.
[23:57.660 --> 24:01.040]  And it'd be nice to just like prep bottles ahead of time for carbonation.
[24:01.620 --> 24:04.200]  And I'm scared to carbonate the water and then leave it
[24:04.200 --> 24:09.620]  because I feel like it'll get stale, like you guys were saying before.
[24:10.080 --> 24:12.880]  So I've been trying to find a solution for that, and I haven't found it yet.
[24:13.280 --> 24:18.260]  I did do some deep diving into if you could buy water purifiers for your bathtub.
[24:18.880 --> 24:21.400]  And they do not exist in the way that I need them to.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.300]  Well, it is like market we could get into.
[24:24.860 --> 24:28.000]  It's like salt bags you can put on the front like it is.
[24:28.140 --> 24:31.200]  It is more a cosmetic thing, but it's like adding to the water.
[24:31.440 --> 24:33.960]  I haven't been able to find just like a Brita for your tub.
[24:35.400 --> 24:37.040]  Why would you who would need that?
[24:37.040 --> 24:40.020]  I do for my carbonation.
[24:40.280 --> 24:41.540]  Just because you don't like changing floors.
[24:42.120 --> 24:43.980]  Yeah, well, it's just it would be more convenient.
[24:44.480 --> 24:46.420]  Why don't you just move your room downstairs?
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.600]  Well, I have my stuff, my work set up, my office.
[24:49.720 --> 24:51.840]  It wouldn't work. It's an open concept downstairs.
[24:53.340 --> 24:54.580]  Be yelling all throughout.
[24:55.120 --> 24:57.400]  I need space. I need a little I need a corner.
[24:59.140 --> 25:03.040]  I wouldn't be able to fit the, uh, I don't know.
[25:03.500 --> 25:05.680]  My two Xboxes, my three Xboxes.
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.540]  It's just an Xbox City over here.
[25:07.980 --> 25:08.960]  I can't do that downstairs.
[25:09.560 --> 25:11.380]  I also don't want to be next to the kitchen.
[25:11.740 --> 25:13.500]  It's just that's a busy place to be.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.480]  I'd rather just have my own fake kitchen upstairs with my Brita.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.500]  I think I'm going to get you can get like jug Brita's, right?
[25:23.860 --> 25:25.460]  Yeah, I think that might be that one.
[25:25.480 --> 25:26.080]  They're fine.
[25:26.660 --> 25:27.220]  They're fine.
[25:27.300 --> 25:31.800]  OK, what if you run a hose from the downstairs kitchen?
[25:32.660 --> 25:35.960]  Out of the house, up the side of the wall and into your room.
[25:36.560 --> 25:40.560]  Well, the problem with the hose is that you have to be at the source to turn it on or off.
[25:40.660 --> 25:42.960]  No, leave it on and then just cork it.
[25:43.980 --> 25:48.060]  You mean like one of those hoses where you can like twist the
[25:48.680 --> 25:51.600]  knob to like have the flow go or not go?
[25:51.780 --> 25:52.000]  Yeah.
[25:52.540 --> 25:55.460]  Is that if I leave the water running, is it just like it?
[25:57.320 --> 26:00.120]  Environmentally, like what are we what are we talking about for the environment with that?
[26:00.240 --> 26:00.760]  Is that bad?
[26:00.760 --> 26:02.940]  The environment is there's no water coming out.
[26:03.300 --> 26:06.660]  I think you should just get one of these guns and then have that.
[26:07.720 --> 26:09.200]  That's how you fill up your bottles.
[26:11.420 --> 26:14.760]  Because you can do like a light mist if you get warm,
[26:14.920 --> 26:17.400]  and then you can do like the heavy stream to fill up a bottle.
[26:17.500 --> 26:17.980]  You know what I mean?
[26:18.400 --> 26:21.440]  Explain to me what you think is happening with the environment if you leave that on.
[26:22.560 --> 26:23.500]  But I just I don't.
[26:23.640 --> 26:26.780]  The water is where I'm saying, hey, water, get in here.
[26:26.860 --> 26:28.160]  Keep on getting in here.
[26:28.460 --> 26:30.080]  But there's nowhere for it to go.
[26:30.080 --> 26:34.320]  Here's what can happen, because this happened to me literally yesterday.
[26:34.540 --> 26:39.260]  I was giving my dog a bath because he dug a fucking hole in the yard
[26:39.260 --> 26:41.380]  and got covered in dirt and mud.
[26:41.560 --> 26:43.340]  And so I was giving my dog a bath.
[26:43.380 --> 26:47.280]  And I have one of those stupid hoses you see on TV that's all tiny.
[26:47.420 --> 26:50.720]  And then you put water and it goes like and it gets big.
[26:51.060 --> 26:52.320]  Oh, yeah, mine exploded.
[26:53.020 --> 26:54.780]  Yeah, well, I had one of those.
[26:54.840 --> 26:58.940]  And I had a little nozzle attached to the end of it that you put like dog soap in.
[26:58.940 --> 27:00.600]  Then you can spray your dog with it and stuff.
[27:00.740 --> 27:03.520]  And I set it down for a minute and I went inside to get a towel or something.
[27:03.580 --> 27:07.160]  And I came back out a few minutes later and there was just water pouring everywhere.
[27:07.300 --> 27:08.860]  And my entire backyard was covered in water.
[27:09.060 --> 27:09.840]  And I couldn't figure it out.
[27:09.860 --> 27:10.900]  And I ran over and I turned it off.
[27:10.960 --> 27:12.800]  And that fucking hose exploded.
[27:13.020 --> 27:13.720]  Yours went as well?
[27:15.040 --> 27:16.040]  Yeah, just like yours did.
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.280]  And it was creating the biggest fucking mess I've ever seen in my life.
[27:20.680 --> 27:21.480]  It was crazy.
[27:21.620 --> 27:23.720]  It had been it had just been left on like 20 minutes.
[27:23.960 --> 27:26.800]  That's our second exploded hose tale.
[27:27.060 --> 27:28.280]  So now we've got one for each podcast.
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.260]  That's crazy.
[27:30.760 --> 27:32.620]  I wonder whose hose is going to explode next.
[27:33.320 --> 27:35.440]  Well, hopefully not Andrew's because it will explode in his office.
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.220]  Here, I'm going to draw a design of where I think the water might be going.
[27:39.320 --> 27:40.880]  And why it would be environmentally bad.
[27:41.000 --> 27:41.220]  Hell yeah.
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.920]  So this is my favorite conversation we've ever had.
[27:49.120 --> 27:55.620]  The way that it started with Andrew filling up his bottle in the tub.
[27:57.120 --> 27:58.740]  Gavin not drinking hot water.
[27:58.940 --> 28:00.420]  Now running a hose.
[28:00.580 --> 28:04.840]  And Andrew drawing a diagram about how this might not be environmentally friendly.
[28:05.860 --> 28:09.460]  I feel like we haven't lost it between podcasts.
[28:09.480 --> 28:11.020]  This is my drawing.
[28:12.080 --> 28:16.240]  I needed an image to draw on top of.
[28:16.520 --> 28:20.540]  So just ignore the primary point of the image.
[28:22.680 --> 28:26.520]  This is the only way I know how to draw stuff is by putting it into messenger and then
[28:27.180 --> 28:29.940]  drawing over an image that was placed.
[28:30.960 --> 28:33.700]  Hey, before before we end the podcast while he's uploading this,
[28:34.520 --> 28:37.980]  we should remember to talk about the last month.
[28:38.160 --> 28:40.380]  Now that we're on the other end of it, we can like, yeah, yeah.
[28:40.620 --> 28:42.240]  So everything we're only halfway through.
[28:42.340 --> 28:43.440]  We got it. We got tons of time.
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.960]  I know. I'm just giving us a little note to make sure we don't forget.
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.020]  Do you think we're like 30 minutes, dude?
[28:49.580 --> 28:51.040]  OK, so this is my drawing.
[28:51.040 --> 28:52.380]  What do you have?
[28:53.700 --> 28:56.440]  So you've drawn on a screenshot.
[28:57.780 --> 29:02.180]  So this is, as I said, ignore the background image.
[29:02.340 --> 29:03.760]  I just I needed something white.
[29:03.920 --> 29:04.800]  You are an animal.
[29:05.020 --> 29:05.940]  To illustrate this.
[29:05.980 --> 29:07.140]  Have you heard of cropping?
[29:07.280 --> 29:09.920]  Have you heard of just like taking a screenshot of something white?
[29:09.960 --> 29:13.100]  We're on a podcast and I didn't have time to crop.
[29:13.220 --> 29:15.360]  Take a picture of the damn wall and draw that way.
[29:15.860 --> 29:17.300]  Well, I did it.
[29:17.600 --> 29:18.480]  It doesn't matter.
[29:18.860 --> 29:19.620]  Just ignore it.
[29:20.460 --> 29:22.660]  I'm more interested in you just drew an L.
[29:23.320 --> 29:25.820]  Yeah, so this is this is what I'm thinking, right?
[29:26.060 --> 29:29.140]  So I twist the thing and I say, hey, water, get in here.
[29:29.300 --> 29:33.740]  Come in here and you see the light green line.
[29:33.840 --> 29:35.920]  Yeah, that's the hose.
[29:36.200 --> 29:40.000]  So the water is going up the hose and it's not going out
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.820]  because I have the thing saying, hey, don't get out of here.
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.660]  So the left side is the user end.
[29:46.180 --> 29:47.240]  Yes, that's the user.
[29:47.240 --> 29:53.360]  And that would be where I could flip the nozzle or the switch and the water goes and fires.
[29:54.180 --> 29:58.320]  What I don't know is, does the water continue to flow?
[29:58.380 --> 30:01.740]  And because it continues to flow, obviously it can't flow further into the hose.
[30:01.760 --> 30:02.220]  But where?
[30:02.380 --> 30:03.160]  Because there's no room.
[30:03.760 --> 30:04.460]  Does it?
[30:04.940 --> 30:06.640]  Well, I don't know where when I.
[30:06.840 --> 30:07.960]  OK, so let me ask you this.
[30:08.540 --> 30:08.980]  Yeah.
[30:09.120 --> 30:14.260]  When you've got like a tap and you got an outdoor tap usually has a hose on it.
[30:14.920 --> 30:15.180]  Yeah.
[30:15.340 --> 30:16.020]  Take the hose off.
[30:16.020 --> 30:19.040]  OK, there's water pressure, right?
[30:19.380 --> 30:24.860]  It wants to leave the tap, but your tap, if you turn it off, it just it blocks.
[30:25.100 --> 30:25.880]  It blocks the water.
[30:26.700 --> 30:27.700]  Yeah, you're just doing that.
[30:28.140 --> 30:29.100]  But further up.
[30:29.800 --> 30:36.880]  Well, no, I so when I look at when I look at an outside water tap, right?
[30:37.280 --> 30:42.920]  When I look at a tap, I know that if I twist that nozzle, that means water comes out.
[30:43.320 --> 30:45.840]  I don't know what's happening behind that.
[30:45.840 --> 30:48.260]  But you're not making water from that.
[30:48.900 --> 30:50.520]  Do you know how a nozzle works?
[30:51.040 --> 30:53.620]  No, I have no idea how a nozzle works.
[30:53.840 --> 30:55.300]  That's like a door, man.
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.520]  It's just a fucking water door.
[30:57.720 --> 30:59.280]  All it does is open and close.
[31:00.660 --> 31:03.760]  It just opens a hole in the pipe to allow the water.
[31:03.760 --> 31:05.520]  So the water is always going.
[31:06.120 --> 31:07.040]  It's like Hodor.
[31:07.260 --> 31:09.000]  The water is at the door the whole time.
[31:09.540 --> 31:10.940]  And the and the spigot is Hodor.
[31:11.240 --> 31:12.400]  And he's just holding the door.
[31:12.480 --> 31:14.500]  He's holding the water back and he's holding the water back.
[31:14.500 --> 31:17.820]  So that all the fucking the wildlings or whoever can fucking escape.
[31:18.480 --> 31:22.360]  And then every once in a while, you turn the hose and Hodor lets the water out.
[31:23.020 --> 31:29.020]  The only way it's bad for the environment is if Hodor is kind of weak and he's leaking a little.
[31:29.480 --> 31:29.660]  Yeah.
[31:29.800 --> 31:30.200]  Okay.
[31:30.840 --> 31:32.420]  So as long as there's no leak.
[31:32.860 --> 31:35.160]  You just got to make sure Hodor has all of his...
[31:36.420 --> 31:39.480]  What do you call those little rubber rings?
[31:39.900 --> 31:40.740]  Yeah, his seals.
[31:41.180 --> 31:42.580]  You got to make sure his O-rings are in place.
[31:42.780 --> 31:43.220]  His O-rings.
[31:43.760 --> 31:44.740]  His Hodor O-rings.
[31:44.740 --> 31:45.400]  His Hodor O-rings.
[31:49.620 --> 31:50.760]  This is stupid.
[31:50.860 --> 31:52.160]  It'd be nice if they did a bit of hose.
[31:52.640 --> 31:52.900]  This is dumbest.
[31:53.180 --> 31:53.980]  This is a fucking...
[31:53.980 --> 31:56.060]  Maybe you need to reinvent the hose, Andrew.
[31:56.300 --> 31:57.140]  Maybe, maybe that's...
[31:57.140 --> 31:57.840]  No, I don't.
[31:58.140 --> 31:58.420]  Okay.
[31:58.640 --> 32:00.040]  I don't understand any of this.
[32:00.560 --> 32:02.860]  I was gonna say you wanted to reinvent the hose.
[32:02.900 --> 32:04.760]  You don't know how like a faucet works.
[32:04.920 --> 32:05.280]  Yeah.
[32:05.360 --> 32:06.340]  What are you talking about?
[32:06.500 --> 32:07.800]  You could rig that up, Andrew.
[32:07.920 --> 32:09.000]  You could get...
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.300]  How far is the kitchen from where you're sitting?
[32:12.140 --> 32:12.940]  Uh, it's...
[32:12.940 --> 32:13.420]  Oh, that's...
[32:14.980 --> 32:15.380]  Uh...
[32:15.380 --> 32:16.320]  Does the kitchen have a window?
[32:17.180 --> 32:17.540]  Oh, I...
[32:17.540 --> 32:19.860]  Nah, well, it's summer, the flies, I can't...
[32:20.780 --> 32:21.660]  There's a door.
[32:22.180 --> 32:25.940]  I can run it from one door to another door.
[32:26.120 --> 32:26.720]  On the inside?
[32:27.360 --> 32:28.860]  Yeah, well, there's patios.
[32:29.660 --> 32:30.060]  Okay.
[32:30.140 --> 32:31.200]  There's a patio situation.
[32:31.580 --> 32:32.280]  And then could you...
[32:34.380 --> 32:37.200]  Okay, so Geoff just posted an image of how this works.
[32:37.560 --> 32:40.500]  So where does the water go at the bottom?
[32:40.500 --> 32:41.740]  It's just not gonna help.
[32:41.860 --> 32:43.540]  It's just there, it doesn't go anywhere.
[32:43.720 --> 32:46.260]  It's just hanging out there, it's pushing up against the door.
[32:46.940 --> 32:50.660]  That's just that little red screw.
[32:50.920 --> 32:51.940]  That's Hodor, man.
[32:52.320 --> 32:56.400]  It's water pressure from the water company.
[32:57.200 --> 32:58.140]  Yeah, but...
[32:58.140 --> 32:59.060]  Well, wait, the wat...
[32:59.060 --> 33:00.800]  Wait, the company...
[33:00.800 --> 33:02.980]  The water company is providing pressure?
[33:03.580 --> 33:08.180]  Well, I assume the reservoir or whatever water management thing at the other end of the pipe
[33:08.180 --> 33:09.160]  is pushing water.
[33:09.160 --> 33:11.880]  Okay, so let's say I don't pay my water bill.
[33:12.360 --> 33:15.620]  When they shut off my water, what are they doing?
[33:16.000 --> 33:20.560]  They go out to the street in front of your house where there is a shut-off valve,
[33:20.860 --> 33:23.380]  and they shut it off at the street so that...
[33:23.380 --> 33:28.280]  They Hodor it right there, and then so the water can't even get to your...
[33:28.280 --> 33:29.500]  Yeah, that's all it is.
[33:29.560 --> 33:30.800]  It's a series of doors and pipes.
[33:30.980 --> 33:33.720]  What is stopping you from just going out there and turning it back on?
[33:34.420 --> 33:36.320]  With that big, long thing?
[33:37.480 --> 33:39.580]  They might lock it or something? I don't know.
[33:40.040 --> 33:43.720]  Also, probably, it's probably, I don't know, it's against the law, I would assume.
[33:44.300 --> 33:44.820]  Stealing water?
[33:44.820 --> 33:45.780]  I don't even know where I'd find it.
[33:46.320 --> 33:48.020]  I assumed it was in my house, to be honest.
[33:48.340 --> 33:49.520]  Most people don't know where to find it.
[33:49.560 --> 33:50.640]  There's a bunch of them in your house.
[33:50.880 --> 33:54.540]  There's one under your sink that you can turn off right now.
[33:55.380 --> 33:57.960]  There's all kinds of doors along a water pipe.
[33:58.220 --> 33:59.620]  There's one right next to the toilet.
[34:00.120 --> 34:01.560]  Yeah, there's one behind the toilet.
[34:01.820 --> 34:04.240]  There's one next to every faucet.
[34:04.240 --> 34:09.500]  There's one at the faucet and five feet in front of the faucet and everywhere in your house.
[34:10.160 --> 34:15.520]  How do they make sure that the water pressure isn't so much that it pushes in the door?
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.320]  How is that prevented?
[34:19.020 --> 34:19.460]  Science.
[34:20.480 --> 34:21.900]  Great, okay, thanks.
[34:22.100 --> 34:26.820]  Well, a lot of valves can be closed, like, from the pressure.
[34:27.040 --> 34:28.300]  The pressure keeps them closed.
[34:28.860 --> 34:30.460]  And then you have to push them open.
[34:30.460 --> 34:36.400]  A thing that we have happen in Austin that I've never had happen before I moved here
[34:36.400 --> 34:42.980]  is that so much water gets into the treatment plant when it rains
[34:42.980 --> 34:46.980]  that they can't clean it in time for it to get to you, Andrew.
[34:47.560 --> 34:49.620]  So we have a boil notice.
[34:50.060 --> 34:54.200]  And for like 10 days, you have to boil your water because it makes it not potable.
[34:54.540 --> 34:57.260]  Yes, it's overwhelmed by the amount of water.
[34:57.380 --> 34:58.280]  Yes, exactly.
[34:58.280 --> 35:00.480]  So it's a very intricate system.
[35:00.660 --> 35:02.440]  Water is an intricate series of doors.
[35:03.100 --> 35:03.760]  Yeah, it is.
[35:03.960 --> 35:06.100]  But when God says more, then we're fucked.
[35:06.400 --> 35:09.320]  And sometimes it's too full of bacteria from people's butts.
[35:10.380 --> 35:15.740]  And all this shit, all of this shit the Romans figured out thousands of years ago
[35:15.740 --> 35:17.740]  without any electricity or technology.
[35:18.240 --> 35:19.080]  That's crazy.
[35:19.700 --> 35:20.860]  I don't believe that.
[35:21.620 --> 35:22.100]  You should.
[35:22.860 --> 35:23.780]  Well, I do believe it.
[35:23.880 --> 35:25.640]  Like, let me be clear.
[35:25.840 --> 35:27.300]  I'm not saying what you're saying is a lie.
[35:27.300 --> 35:29.320]  I'm not a water conspiracy theorist.
[35:29.440 --> 35:30.800]  I just it's crazy.
[35:30.940 --> 35:37.480]  I want to just go around your house with you and just point at stuff and be like, how does that work?
[35:39.120 --> 35:40.820]  Uh, yeah, no, you can do that.
[35:41.860 --> 35:42.660]  Light switches.
[35:42.780 --> 35:43.420]  I got no idea.
[35:43.880 --> 35:45.540]  That would be a great supplemental series.
[35:46.440 --> 35:47.700]  Andrew explains things.
[35:48.320 --> 35:49.780]  You know, what's funny is I've swapped.
[35:49.900 --> 35:54.020]  I've like installed dimmers before, but I don't know how any of it works.
[35:54.700 --> 35:58.460]  Like, I've put in new new switches, but I don't know.
[35:58.760 --> 36:01.100]  I'm going to go ahead and say that you shouldn't ever do that.
[36:01.460 --> 36:02.680]  Yeah, no, I know how to do it.
[36:02.720 --> 36:03.680]  You turn the breaker off.
[36:03.860 --> 36:04.160]  You understand?
[36:04.460 --> 36:04.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:04.840 --> 36:05.540]  Loop de loops.
[36:05.860 --> 36:09.240]  But you know, it's really not that different from water.
[36:09.840 --> 36:11.520]  It's the breakers are just doors.
[36:12.040 --> 36:12.760]  It's all doors.
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.900]  Opening and closing electric current.
[36:15.140 --> 36:21.020]  Yeah, I think in Australia, you're not allowed to do your own electrician.
[36:22.160 --> 36:22.600]  Really?
[36:22.600 --> 36:23.220]  Yeah.
[36:24.200 --> 36:26.020]  What if you are an electrician?
[36:26.040 --> 36:26.960]  Then I think it's fine.
[36:27.780 --> 36:28.160]  Okay.
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.100]  It'd be a weird rule if you were an electrician and you had to hire somebody else.
[36:33.220 --> 36:35.180]  You had to hire someone at the place you work.
[36:35.620 --> 36:36.940]  How are your dimmers, by the way?
[36:37.720 --> 36:41.160]  I haven't had a dimmer in a long time, but I have installed them in the past.
[36:41.280 --> 36:42.220]  And then they've always worked.
[36:42.640 --> 36:43.000]  Sweet.
[36:43.760 --> 36:44.120]  Never.
[36:44.480 --> 36:47.480]  I've never had a fire related to dimmers.
[36:47.940 --> 36:49.600]  Just related to desk dogs.
[36:50.200 --> 36:50.780]  Desk dogs.
[36:50.880 --> 36:51.840]  Yeah, that's a problem.
[36:53.200 --> 36:54.580]  I'm trying to think of any other fires.
[36:54.880 --> 36:58.880]  I think the hose in the window of the room you're in now,
[36:58.980 --> 37:01.360]  I think that's going to do wonders for you if you set that up.
[37:01.740 --> 37:02.640]  I think you'll love that.
[37:03.340 --> 37:03.660]  Yeah.
[37:04.660 --> 37:06.400]  I'm worried someone's going to steal the hose.
[37:09.160 --> 37:10.780]  Because I had my doorbell stolen.
[37:11.400 --> 37:11.880]  And it would have to be...
[37:11.880 --> 37:12.840]  Well, how are they going to steal it?
[37:12.880 --> 37:18.640]  Like, if you see the hose starting to pull backwards towards the window, just grab it.
[37:18.840 --> 37:21.040]  And then you get to play a fun game of tug of war with a thief.
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.100]  Attach a bell to it on the other end so you can hear it being stolen.
[37:25.580 --> 37:27.560]  Tie it around a table leg.
[37:28.080 --> 37:29.260]  No, I'm going to be...
[37:29.260 --> 37:32.780]  I'm going to be laying in my bed with my headphones on,
[37:32.900 --> 37:35.360]  with a waterfall going out of my head.
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.440]  I'm not hearing my hose getting stolen, no matter the amount of bells.
[37:39.640 --> 37:42.020]  Imagine if someone stole it while you were using it.
[37:44.380 --> 37:46.100]  This gets ripped out of your hands.
[37:46.940 --> 37:48.820]  Water just shooting everywhere.
[37:52.980 --> 37:54.460]  Oh, you've got to do this, Andrew.
[37:56.280 --> 37:57.960]  I'll evaluate and I'll see.
[37:58.140 --> 38:00.000]  Yeah, it would be a really long hose.
[38:00.200 --> 38:03.420]  It's going to solve so many problems you didn't even know you had.
[38:03.500 --> 38:05.560]  Just think of all the unintended benefits.
[38:06.960 --> 38:07.940]  I'm trying to think.
[38:08.800 --> 38:10.940]  Like, you won't even know it till in the moment.
[38:11.020 --> 38:11.920]  And then you'll be like, oh, you know what?
[38:11.960 --> 38:12.480]  This, you know what?
[38:12.480 --> 38:13.540]  It would be great if I had a hose.
[38:13.580 --> 38:14.060]  I do.
[38:14.440 --> 38:16.100]  And then you're going to be like, oh, this is a...
[38:16.100 --> 38:17.440]  Chalk another one up for good idea.
[38:18.100 --> 38:19.840]  You'll be so much more hydrated as well.
[38:19.880 --> 38:22.160]  Because I feel like sometimes you might be feeling a bit thirsty,
[38:22.160 --> 38:24.380]  but then you're just like, nah, yeah.
[38:24.880 --> 38:28.300]  And the nice thing about a hose is it can put that water in you fast.
[38:29.460 --> 38:33.860]  OK, so realistically, a good use of this would be and I just can't.
[38:34.600 --> 38:35.540]  I think it's a bad idea.
[38:35.640 --> 38:36.340]  I'm not supposed to.
[38:36.660 --> 38:41.820]  But an inflatable hot tub would be great on the patio and it would be very tight.
[38:42.060 --> 38:43.420]  There'd not be a lot of room for it.
[38:43.480 --> 38:45.280]  I'm not supposed to do something like that.
[38:45.280 --> 38:46.460]  Are you talking like on your balcony?
[38:47.720 --> 38:49.420]  Yeah, yeah, that'd be real nice.
[38:49.420 --> 38:52.520]  You think you can support the weight of a hot tub?
[38:53.160 --> 38:54.440]  An inflatable hot tub?
[38:54.780 --> 38:55.040]  Yes.
[38:55.200 --> 38:59.780]  Well, most of the weight's going to be in the water probably, I would think.
[39:00.660 --> 39:02.620]  Well, you know, they're pretty big as well.
[39:02.960 --> 39:03.880]  I see what you're saying.
[39:04.040 --> 39:05.140]  What's below your balcony?
[39:05.640 --> 39:06.400]  Another balcony.
[39:07.140 --> 39:09.680]  Yeah, you might want to warn them to be very wet.
[39:10.000 --> 39:10.980]  But it's my balcony.
[39:11.740 --> 39:13.220]  Oh, oh, you're fine.
[39:13.420 --> 39:14.700]  Well, you should warn yourself.
[39:15.260 --> 39:18.420]  I do want to note that full of water and people,
[39:18.620 --> 39:22.280]  inflatable hot tubs can easily weigh up to 2,500 pounds.
[39:22.480 --> 39:27.300]  So just do less people and a little less water down to about 2K and you're good, dude.
[39:27.540 --> 39:33.340]  Do you happen to know, can your balcony support the weight of a car?
[39:33.720 --> 39:34.940]  Because that's about what that is.
[39:35.680 --> 39:36.840]  Why wouldn't it be able to?
[39:37.300 --> 39:38.780]  I don't know, that's what I'm asking.
[39:39.220 --> 39:41.620]  If you think it can support a car, then it's...
[39:41.620 --> 39:46.760]  If you could put like a Nissan Sentra on it, I think you can put a hot tub.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.840]  Yeah, I think I'm probably just a bad read on that.
[39:51.100 --> 39:53.380]  In my head, it's sturdy.
[39:53.760 --> 39:57.640]  Is it held up by beams from below or is it just hanging out of the side of the building?
[39:58.220 --> 40:00.280]  I think it's just hanging out of the side of the building.
[40:00.620 --> 40:01.480]  You know what you could do?
[40:01.940 --> 40:05.120]  You could get some chains and you could loop them to the balcony.
[40:05.260 --> 40:06.100]  Is there anything above you?
[40:06.120 --> 40:06.940]  Here we go, yeah.
[40:07.700 --> 40:08.660]  Just the roof.
[40:09.060 --> 40:10.180]  Here's what you do with the chains.
[40:10.260 --> 40:10.580]  Perfect.
[40:10.580 --> 40:14.160]  You get the chains, you loop them up to the roof and then you winch that so it's secure
[40:14.160 --> 40:15.860]  and now you've got extra support.
[40:16.200 --> 40:16.740]  Forget the roof.
[40:17.020 --> 40:21.580]  Put the chains, hurl them straight over the top of the building so they hang down on the other side
[40:21.580 --> 40:24.260]  and hold up a balcony on that side too.
[40:24.940 --> 40:25.740]  Perfect idea.
[40:25.760 --> 40:27.080]  So they're holding each other up.
[40:27.640 --> 40:27.860]  Yeah.
[40:28.140 --> 40:29.420]  You don't even need chains for that.
[40:29.500 --> 40:30.820]  You could do nylon rope, probably.
[40:30.900 --> 40:31.280]  That would hold.
[40:31.780 --> 40:34.020]  What is the weight capacity of the average balcony?
[40:35.620 --> 40:40.560]  Dude, we had...
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.500]  maybe 12 years ago where a bunch of people were having a party on a balcony on this fucking
[40:45.500 --> 40:49.740]  house over on the east side and it was on the second floor and there were like 40 people
[40:49.740 --> 40:51.020]  on the balcony when it collapsed.
[40:51.860 --> 40:56.500]  And there was a lot of a lot of people got like, not severely, but, you know, decently
[40:56.500 --> 40:57.520]  fucked up from it.
[40:59.100 --> 41:03.960]  I have an answer immediately of generally speaking, balconies are load rated to 50 to
[41:03.960 --> 41:05.600]  100 pounds per square foot.
[41:05.980 --> 41:10.200]  And then immediately and people also ask, can my balcony hold a hot tub?
[41:11.380 --> 41:12.260]  Oh, well, there you go.
[41:12.380 --> 41:17.700]  And the answer is almost always the best choice and most can hold a small hot tub.
[41:18.160 --> 41:22.020]  Most high rise apartments and condos, a balcony is built with reinforced steel and cement,
[41:22.040 --> 41:24.520]  which will not be damaged by steam.
[41:25.240 --> 41:25.820]  There's another one.
[41:25.880 --> 41:28.320]  Our balcony is strong, which I just I love that.
[41:28.340 --> 41:30.580]  It's like what a dumb, dumb guy.
[41:30.740 --> 41:31.980]  Our balcony is strong.
[41:33.540 --> 41:37.600]  So it's like 100 foot pounds per square foot, so I could figure it out.
[41:37.620 --> 41:38.620]  I do the math on this.
[41:38.680 --> 41:39.300]  I can measure it.
[41:39.860 --> 41:44.540]  Did you see the the comment leaver that posted this picture?
[41:46.540 --> 41:47.140]  Yeah.
[41:53.580 --> 41:58.820]  It is an Achievement Hunter logo.
[41:59.820 --> 42:03.920]  Yeah, well, not let me actually rephrase that.
[42:03.960 --> 42:05.240]  It is not an Achievement Hunter logo.
[42:05.240 --> 42:13.240]  It is a green circular face symbol with regulation podcast logo.
[42:14.440 --> 42:15.740]  Which happens to be the.
[42:16.600 --> 42:19.080]  Oh, yeah, we changed her name.
[42:19.340 --> 42:19.660]  Sorry.
[42:21.400 --> 42:24.220]  The lineage in that image is hilarious.
[42:24.760 --> 42:28.000]  I think that needs to be more like sequel things like that.
[42:28.500 --> 42:33.040]  Yeah, if the background was was red on one side and blue on the other,
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.080]  instead of all black, we just have your whole situation.
[42:38.980 --> 42:41.880]  Like there's my entire adult life in 300 pixels.
[42:43.140 --> 42:43.920]  Oh, my God.
[42:44.240 --> 42:46.880]  There weren't enough sequel bands, I think.
[42:48.200 --> 42:49.980]  Sequel bands like B.A.N.D.S.?
[42:50.500 --> 42:57.560]  Yeah, like you had Geofferson Airplane and then Geofferson Starship and then Starship.
[42:57.720 --> 43:00.860]  It's like you can see the you can see every iteration.
[43:00.860 --> 43:02.460]  There was Oingo Boingo.
[43:02.680 --> 43:04.960]  And then they were just Boingo, I believe.
[43:05.740 --> 43:06.600]  I'm not joking.
[43:06.760 --> 43:07.100]  I'm serious.
[43:07.200 --> 43:10.470]  Yeah, I think they became just Boingo at some point.
[43:12.520 --> 43:13.380]  Any other ones?
[43:13.480 --> 43:16.100]  What other ones would you consider?
[43:16.320 --> 43:18.160]  Does every member have to be?
[43:18.280 --> 43:22.040]  Can it just like how many members have to be in the new band for it to be considered a sequel?
[43:22.380 --> 43:25.180]  Like, would you consider the Foo Fighters to be a sequel of Nirvana?
[43:25.700 --> 43:28.740]  No, I think it needs to be 51% or more.
[43:28.740 --> 43:32.220]  Yeah, it sort of turns into like a ship of Theseus, doesn't it?
[43:32.360 --> 43:35.080]  Like, yeah, we're just taking out you're taking out boards,
[43:35.200 --> 43:37.380]  I guess, band members and replacing them with other ones.
[43:37.500 --> 43:41.220]  Well, there's a lot of bands out there that exist right now that are that are that
[43:42.340 --> 43:45.240]  zero surviving original members still going strong.
[43:45.400 --> 43:48.100]  It's crazy when that happens, like Human League in the 80s,
[43:48.100 --> 43:49.480]  I think before they got really popular,
[43:49.700 --> 43:51.840]  all the original members of the band had left.
[43:51.960 --> 43:53.560]  So by the time that they got popular,
[43:53.560 --> 43:56.060]  it was just a bunch of people that didn't start Human League.
[43:56.620 --> 43:59.220]  It's like, oh, that's doesn't make any sense.
[43:59.360 --> 43:59.820]  That's crazy.
[44:00.340 --> 44:04.840]  Dude, I don't think any of the original members of GWAR are alive.
[44:05.560 --> 44:07.940]  Wild. That's crazy.
[44:09.600 --> 44:13.120]  There's definitely not a single original member in that band,
[44:13.160 --> 44:18.280]  but I think maybe one of the last original member died this year or last year.
[44:21.220 --> 44:25.540]  Circling back to cool Achievement Hunter regulation podcast logo,
[44:25.540 --> 44:30.260]  we should talk about what's been going on since like over like the last month
[44:30.260 --> 44:34.080]  and sort of before that to how we came to be
[44:34.080 --> 44:37.540]  and how we have all of our RSS feed stuff and everything set and settled.
[44:38.360 --> 44:39.160]  I agree.
[44:39.640 --> 44:41.860]  Can we can we do that?
[44:41.920 --> 44:45.000]  Can I loop up music before I have one more music thing?
[44:45.080 --> 44:45.960]  Oh, please say.
[44:46.420 --> 44:47.060]  Oh, yeah, I didn't get that.
[44:47.180 --> 44:51.140]  I had I had a big I had a whole thing recently.
[44:51.140 --> 44:56.000]  You ever on like your TikTok feed or whatever and whatever your feed is,
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.860]  you ever just get like it decides randomly that you're going to get 50 versions of one thing
[45:01.380 --> 45:04.980]  like you've done nothing to influence it, but it's just like the algorithm is like,
[45:05.100 --> 45:06.660]  hey, you need to watch this.
[45:07.200 --> 45:08.220]  This is your thing to watch.
[45:08.520 --> 45:10.280]  Is that something that I've only experienced?
[45:11.180 --> 45:11.320]  No.
[45:12.420 --> 45:13.460]  Great, thank you.
[45:13.920 --> 45:14.660]  Good assistance.
[45:14.780 --> 45:15.640]  Good teamwork, y'all.
[45:16.300 --> 45:18.140]  Episode four, it feels like it.
[45:18.260 --> 45:18.500]  Yeah.
[45:18.580 --> 45:19.680]  No, I was just confirming.
[45:19.680 --> 45:21.240]  Yeah, I agree.
[45:21.400 --> 45:22.200]  That was fun.
[45:22.380 --> 45:23.220]  But there's silence.
[45:23.340 --> 45:24.260]  I had to wait for that.
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.340]  I want because then if there wasn't, I'd explain further.
[45:26.720 --> 45:28.760]  I definitely call into the silence.
[45:29.200 --> 45:35.620]  I randomly, for some reason, TikTok decided I needed to see a live performance of Macklemore
[45:35.620 --> 45:37.880]  doing downtown one day.
[45:37.940 --> 45:40.280]  And I got like 10 different things of it.
[45:40.440 --> 45:44.020]  And that is not that is a song I haven't thought about in a very long time.
[45:44.120 --> 45:44.660]  How does it go?
[45:45.500 --> 45:48.680]  It's like downtown down.
[45:49.360 --> 45:51.560]  And then they yell town a lot.
[45:51.620 --> 45:55.580]  And then there's something about leather and legs.
[45:55.660 --> 45:56.060]  I don't know.
[45:56.300 --> 46:01.820]  Anyway, I always thought that the person who did the chorus of that song was the best part
[46:01.820 --> 46:02.460]  of that song.
[46:02.760 --> 46:03.600]  I don't know their name.
[46:03.880 --> 46:05.040]  I don't know anything about them.
[46:05.300 --> 46:09.860]  But because I kept getting them on TikTok performing with Macklemore, I thought I should
[46:09.860 --> 46:12.700]  look into this person and see what they've done.
[46:12.980 --> 46:14.300]  I don't know anything about them.
[46:14.660 --> 46:19.740]  So I did some research and I guess they're the lead singer of a band called Foxy Shazam.
[46:20.180 --> 46:22.020]  Does anyone here heard of Foxy Shazam?
[46:22.580 --> 46:24.360]  No, no, no.
[46:24.400 --> 46:27.740]  I had zero point of reference, but I'm not the biggest music guy, so I didn't know anything
[46:27.740 --> 46:28.200]  about them.
[46:28.460 --> 46:34.920]  So I put Foxy Shazam into YouTube and I thought, I'll just listen to some of their songs because
[46:34.920 --> 46:36.460]  I've never explored this.
[46:36.840 --> 46:38.720]  I like what the guy did in downtown.
[46:39.620 --> 46:40.840]  I'm interested to see.
[46:40.940 --> 46:43.380]  So I go through the first one and it's like, that's fine, whatever.
[46:43.860 --> 46:49.580]  And then it was crazy because the second song I listened to, I realized I've heard this
[46:49.580 --> 46:51.640]  song like 10,000 times.
[46:51.760 --> 46:53.920]  I had no idea it was him or was associated.
[46:54.380 --> 47:00.540]  It was one of the songs in NHL 13, which is a game that I played so much the UI burnt
[47:00.540 --> 47:01.380]  into my television.
[47:01.620 --> 47:07.680]  Like I spent thousands of hours making fake Vancouver Canucks teams in NHL 13.
[47:07.960 --> 47:12.980]  I love that game and it was crazy to think, oh, this guy that I was aware of, but thought
[47:12.980 --> 47:19.180]  I had no connection to, did a song that I've heard like 10,000 times and I had no idea.
[47:19.280 --> 47:20.800]  I immediately recognized it.
[47:21.040 --> 47:22.220]  I was having a great time.
[47:22.380 --> 47:24.080]  I'm going to post the lyrics.
[47:25.260 --> 47:29.020]  And so Foxy Shazam is one of your most listened to artists, probably.
[47:29.380 --> 47:32.000]  It is one of my most listened to artists and I didn't even know it.
[47:32.320 --> 47:33.180]  Here are the lyrics.
[47:33.520 --> 47:35.100]  If someone wants to read them.
[47:35.820 --> 47:37.920]  So come on, come on, come on, come on.
[47:38.280 --> 47:39.320]  Show me a little more.
[47:39.600 --> 47:40.740]  Come on, come on, come on.
[47:40.960 --> 47:41.620]  I like it.
[47:41.860 --> 47:42.500]  I like it.
[47:42.980 --> 47:43.700]  I like it.
[47:43.980 --> 47:45.940]  I like it a lot.
[47:46.380 --> 47:48.060]  That's the chorus of that song.
[47:48.300 --> 47:52.880]  And so I'm listening to it and I'm like, that's this is take me back to the old days.
[47:52.880 --> 47:55.420]  Yeah, I'll play in NHL 13.
[47:56.100 --> 47:59.980]  But then, then we had a little bit of blindside.
[48:01.500 --> 48:02.620]  Geoff, could you?
[48:02.900 --> 48:04.960]  I'll interject with the addition.
[48:06.120 --> 48:07.920]  Okay, let me let me post.
[48:08.860 --> 48:10.140]  I just lost my page.
[48:11.240 --> 48:13.640]  I fumbled this tremendously.
[48:14.980 --> 48:16.280]  But I like it.
[48:16.280 --> 48:17.200]  Lead singer of this band.
[48:17.760 --> 48:18.040]  Okay.
[48:18.800 --> 48:19.880]  Is named Eric.
[48:20.480 --> 48:23.520]  This is I felt like I was getting blindsided by Eric when this happened.
[48:25.080 --> 48:25.960]  Oh, fuck.
[48:27.500 --> 48:28.560]  Oh, wait, no.
[48:28.600 --> 48:29.820]  What's happening with you?
[48:29.900 --> 48:31.400]  I just got lost on the tab here.
[48:31.500 --> 48:31.800]  Here we go.
[48:31.820 --> 48:32.280]  Okay, ready?
[48:33.300 --> 48:33.980]  Read it, Geoff.
[48:33.980 --> 48:35.940]  And then when there's an addition, I'll cut in.
[48:36.440 --> 48:38.400]  So are the additions in the...
[48:38.400 --> 48:40.860]  Just read the lyrics and I will cut in.
[48:41.000 --> 48:41.620]  I'm just gonna read it.
[48:41.700 --> 48:41.840]  Okay.
[48:42.740 --> 48:43.640]  Oh, come on.
[48:43.760 --> 48:45.060]  Come on, come on, come on.
[48:45.320 --> 48:46.460]  Show me a little more.
[48:46.740 --> 48:48.120]  Come on, come on, come on.
[48:48.300 --> 48:50.480]  That's the biggest black ass I've ever seen.
[48:50.940 --> 48:51.820]  And I like it.
[48:51.920 --> 48:52.760]  I like it.
[48:53.480 --> 48:55.800]  That's the biggest black ass I've ever seen.
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.140]  And I like it.
[48:57.260 --> 48:58.440]  I like it a lot.
[48:59.160 --> 49:00.340]  Canucks playoff meta.
[49:01.200 --> 49:03.180]  Yeah, that was part of my notes.
[49:04.840 --> 49:06.200]  Completely unrelated to that.
[49:06.200 --> 49:10.180]  But I had no idea that song was about big black asses.
[49:10.540 --> 49:11.600]  I've heard that song.
[49:11.740 --> 49:14.460]  They edited that out of NHL 13.
[49:14.740 --> 49:23.460]  The version that you said at the top was how I have known that song for like 12 years.
[49:23.720 --> 49:25.120]  So it's like an edited...
[49:25.120 --> 49:27.620]  So it just skips lines in the song?
[49:27.780 --> 49:29.120]  Or have they like re-recorded it?
[49:29.540 --> 49:31.400]  No, so they just edited it.
[49:31.440 --> 49:34.680]  But it's not a popular enough song to have a radio edit.
[49:34.680 --> 49:41.720]  So the only version that's like that is in NHL 13 and it's not in any other games.
[49:42.400 --> 49:44.300]  So I was trying to record it.
[49:44.460 --> 49:49.140]  I ordered a copy of NHL 13 so I could clip the version that I've heard.
[49:49.420 --> 49:50.580]  And I'll get that eventually.
[49:51.100 --> 49:56.640]  But I was stunned at like 1am listening to this when it cut into black asses.
[49:56.760 --> 49:57.680]  I had no idea.
[49:58.500 --> 50:01.640]  It blew my mind that that is what this song is about.
[50:03.320 --> 50:05.540]  I never really paid attention to the lyrics to begin with,
[50:05.620 --> 50:07.680]  but I was like, I would have noticed that.
[50:08.720 --> 50:09.400]  It's yellow.
[50:09.580 --> 50:10.860]  That must have been so...
[50:10.860 --> 50:13.480]  Because that kind of stuff, when you've seen something a billion times
[50:13.480 --> 50:16.720]  and then you see like the unedited version, it's so jarring.
[50:17.080 --> 50:18.940]  Were you like gobsmacked by that?
[50:19.080 --> 50:20.140]  I couldn't believe it.
[50:20.240 --> 50:23.100]  I was more shocked than when all the Boba pearls flew into my mouth.
[50:23.220 --> 50:26.060]  It was... I truly felt blindsided.
[50:26.380 --> 50:27.680]  So which version do you like more?
[50:29.260 --> 50:30.720]  I don't know if I have a pick.
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.800]  I'm still processing my feelings that I feel like I've been lied to for the past 12 years.
[50:35.800 --> 50:38.220]  Did you feel like you were in a bizarro world for a second?
[50:39.500 --> 50:43.600]  Or did you immediately understand what happened and clock it?
[50:43.640 --> 50:47.240]  Or did it take you a second to figure out, like, am I being Mandela affected right now?
[50:47.340 --> 50:48.840]  No, I immediately knew...
[50:48.840 --> 50:49.460]  Do I have false memories?
[50:50.200 --> 50:53.580]  Only because I had played that game, as I said, for so many hours.
[50:53.580 --> 50:55.780]  Like the fact it was burned into my television.
[50:56.240 --> 50:57.320]  I know that song.
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.860]  I know every song on that game.
[51:00.380 --> 51:02.580]  It's just... it stunned me.
[51:02.860 --> 51:05.280]  It never even occurred to me it could be a radio edit.
[51:05.480 --> 51:08.100]  And the fact that it was, and that's what was edited out.
[51:08.220 --> 51:09.160]  But not even a radio edit.
[51:09.460 --> 51:11.280]  They just chose not to include that.
[51:11.840 --> 51:15.040]  Do you think there are people who have only heard the Black Eyed Peas singing,
[51:15.220 --> 51:15.960]  Let's Get It Started?
[51:16.700 --> 51:17.440]  Oh, absolutely.
[51:17.820 --> 51:19.160]  I would say a lot of people.
[51:21.000 --> 51:21.400]  100%.
[51:21.400 --> 51:22.120]  Yeah.
[51:22.280 --> 51:23.140]  I thought you were going to say...
[51:23.140 --> 51:30.020]  I'm curious how many people have only heard that song through NHL 13 like I have to this point.
[51:30.220 --> 51:31.380]  Probably a lot, dude.
[51:31.860 --> 51:32.420]  And are shocked.
[51:32.620 --> 51:37.300]  I wonder if more people know that version or the original version.
[51:37.980 --> 51:40.180]  I don't think the original one was even a single.
[51:40.340 --> 51:40.900]  So I...
[51:40.900 --> 51:41.000]  Yeah.
[51:41.500 --> 51:42.860]  Like... it has to be.
[51:43.100 --> 51:48.060]  How do you go from like, okay, we need to put... we need to license music for our sports game.
[51:48.280 --> 51:50.160]  We want some kind of hip, fresh stuff.
[51:50.760 --> 51:51.900]  Nothing too expensive.
[51:51.900 --> 51:54.020]  So we have to get some up and coming artists.
[51:55.100 --> 51:57.600]  Here's a song about big asses.
[51:58.500 --> 51:59.800]  What if we cut all that?
[51:59.900 --> 52:02.080]  Does it sound like... if you just like remove the word ass.
[52:02.200 --> 52:02.920]  Do you think hockey?
[52:03.260 --> 52:04.700]  And somebody's like, I think I could see a puck.
[52:04.920 --> 52:07.740]  And they're like, okay, let's just cut all the references to ass out.
[52:07.820 --> 52:09.220]  And then people just think we like hockey.
[52:09.300 --> 52:10.020]  And they're like, perfect.
[52:10.140 --> 52:11.180]  Put it in the... it's cheap.
[52:11.300 --> 52:12.060]  Put it in the game.
[52:12.620 --> 52:17.240]  Do people still do that where they'll record different versions of the song for radio?
[52:17.720 --> 52:18.560]  I think so, yeah.
[52:18.800 --> 52:19.000]  Yeah.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.280]  I don't think there's a... I don't think that's ever going away.
[52:21.600 --> 52:24.200]  I just feel like they just play it or like mute it now.
[52:24.480 --> 52:26.280]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of like...
[52:26.280 --> 52:29.920]  I do hear a lot of like hip hop songs on the radio that are just muted at the moment.
[52:30.140 --> 52:30.300]  Yeah.
[52:31.420 --> 52:34.940]  I remember listening to... what was it? Purple Pills.
[52:35.660 --> 52:36.340]  D12 song.
[52:38.220 --> 52:42.200]  And it's... the radio one is just literally a completely different song.
[52:43.140 --> 52:44.440]  Like all the lyrics are different.
[52:45.280 --> 52:45.800]  Oh wow.
[52:45.800 --> 52:50.140]  How about that CeeLo Green classic, Forget You?
[52:50.880 --> 52:51.560]  Oh yeah.
[52:55.060 --> 52:59.100]  Anyway, sorry. We can talk about RSS and all that stuff. I just... I wanted to...
[52:59.100 --> 52:59.300]  Oh!
[52:59.440 --> 53:00.240]  We're talking about music.
[53:00.560 --> 53:06.440]  We should talk about RSS and all that stuff. But first, what if I pitched to you guys on an idea?
[53:07.020 --> 53:11.760]  On another way to make money in tandem to the Regulation Podcast or
[53:12.180 --> 53:16.160]  in case things go south on the podcast and we need to pivot.
[53:17.100 --> 53:20.140]  The other day, it's been about... it's been a while now. I think I actually talked about this
[53:20.140 --> 53:24.300]  before I formalized the idea. I think I might even mention it on or near ANMA.
[53:24.640 --> 53:29.840]  About a month or so ago, I was driving around and I was just in a neighborhood stuck at a stoplight
[53:29.840 --> 53:35.100]  and I was immediately behind a dump truck. And I don't really pay much attention to dump trucks,
[53:35.160 --> 53:39.580]  but that day I decided that that dump truck was interesting. It just like stuck out to me.
[53:39.580 --> 53:44.220]  And so I was looking at it and I realized a dump truck's not that big.
[53:45.320 --> 53:50.140]  It fit on the road with me. And I was like, man, you could probably have a dump truck
[53:50.140 --> 53:54.420]  as your personal vehicle. And then I was thinking about the benefits of a dump truck.
[53:54.760 --> 53:58.600]  You look at the back, you could fit a lot of shit in that thing. I was thinking recently,
[53:59.120 --> 54:02.700]  I've been doing some furniture moving and stuff recently. And it's like you get a moving truck,
[54:02.800 --> 54:07.900]  it's huge. It's a pain in the ass. A dump truck, you could throw most of a house in a dump truck
[54:07.900 --> 54:11.560]  very unceremoniously and it'd be like no big deal, right? It's like a big pickup.
[54:11.720 --> 54:17.340]  And that got me thinking, what if you bought a dump truck and you turned it into a side business
[54:17.340 --> 54:22.460]  where you just like tape a sign on the side of it that says like, need a dump? And then you just
[54:22.460 --> 54:28.380]  like drive around to Walmarts and Home Depots, just up and down the aisles and then wait for
[54:28.380 --> 54:32.380]  your phone to ring. And I guarantee you in a day, you just drive to a dude's house. He's like,
[54:32.420 --> 54:35.280]  yeah, I just got all this lawn furniture I want to get rid of. And you don't even have to help
[54:35.280 --> 54:40.300]  him, right? You could be like, anything you want, throw it in my dump truck, 200 bucks,
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.020]  I'll get rid of it. And then you just drive around for eight hours until your dump truck's full.
[54:45.200 --> 54:48.680]  And then you go to the dump and you pay like 400 bucks to throw it out or whatever,
[54:48.880 --> 54:53.260]  probably clear like a grand or more. And if we got two dump trucks, Gavin, think about this.
[54:53.460 --> 54:57.200]  We could have a two person or we could even get bigger and bigger and bigger. But I was thinking
[54:57.200 --> 55:04.180]  we could call it dump and dumper. We could have a dump truck and a dumper truck. And then we could
[55:04.180 --> 55:09.040]  just go around and provide the service. And we're not really even doing any work. We're just
[55:09.040 --> 55:13.120]  driving from point A to point B, letting people throw their own shit in the dump truck. So we
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.940]  get out. Yeah, we don't really have to get out. We'll have to deal with it at the at the at the
[55:17.940 --> 55:23.880]  I guess the the city landfill or wherever we get rid of it. There'll probably be some effort there.
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.180]  But that's pretty much it. And then also, as we age and become successful, we could change the
[55:28.180 --> 55:36.520]  name to dumpy old men. Oh, I like to be mostly based around the name. Yeah, I got a lot of dump
[55:36.520 --> 55:43.200]  up the volume. I got big dumps. I got dump star. I got pump and dump. If you want to focus on gyms.
[55:44.520 --> 55:50.600]  I got a good one. Dumpty. The boys of Dumpty. You know, we have we have yeah, boys of Dumpty.
[55:50.680 --> 55:55.760]  We have a we have a whole Humpty Dumpty thing in our past. So I wanted to call it Dumpasaurus. But
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.780]  that exists. There's already a service that does exactly that called Dumpasaurus. What if
[55:59.780 --> 56:05.280]  Dumpty could be if you just deliver golf tees? That's true. That's true. Or we could do bathtubs
[56:05.280 --> 56:16.880]  and we could be tub dumpers. So stupid. I guarantee you here. I've even done a little bit of work
[56:16.880 --> 56:21.920]  on it here. Hold on a second. Let me copy this. Are you allowed to just start your own landfill?
[56:21.920 --> 56:32.140]  Dude. If you had the land, I would think so. Here is an option. That is a Volvo VNL 64 T300
[56:32.140 --> 56:37.940]  for sale. Twenty four grand. It's gorgeous. It's in Central Texas. We could pick it up tomorrow
[56:37.940 --> 56:42.080]  and bam, we could get started immediately. I'm not saying we should. I'm just saying it's
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.760]  nice to know that that's available out there. Twenty four grand. If and when we want it.
[56:46.760 --> 56:52.760]  It's a 2008, man. That's you know, it's good. Yeah. It's already got a million three hundred
[56:52.760 --> 56:56.920]  and thirty one thousand miles on it and it's going strong. These things are built to last.
[56:57.220 --> 57:03.000]  Wait, it has what? Wait, it has one million three hundred and thirty three thousand miles.
[57:03.380 --> 57:08.460]  It's not just for popping out to the shops. It's been driven all the time.
[57:08.980 --> 57:14.080]  A million is crazy. That's to the moon and back twice.
[57:17.760 --> 57:21.660]  I guess it's done one point three. And we're not going nearly that far. We're just going
[57:21.660 --> 57:27.700]  through some rich neighborhoods to the dump. I will say I like where your head is at. I am
[57:27.700 --> 57:32.680]  wondering if maybe you just need to play some more trucks. Maybe you're just missing trucks
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.620]  and you're trying to find a way to bring them back into your life. I think you're right. There
[57:36.620 --> 57:41.400]  might be some truth to that. But dude, come on. Rolling around in a dump truck called Dump and
[57:41.400 --> 57:48.040]  Dumper or Dumpy Oldman would be pretty fucking cool. And as silly as it is, I guarantee you that
[57:48.040 --> 57:53.160]  business model immediately works. And I bet within a month and a half you've paid that off and you're
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.000]  just making pure profit. I think you're underestimating how much it costs to dump a
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.980]  whole dump trucks worth of. Well, I looked into it. I looked into it and I couldn't find.
[58:02.460 --> 58:07.900]  I do my research. I couldn't find any landfills that listed prices for dump trucks.
[58:07.900 --> 58:11.760]  But for the biggest truck they had listed, it was like 250 bucks.
[58:12.280 --> 58:16.800]  But I think you could probably fit a good $10,000 worth of stuff in one dump truck
[58:17.420 --> 58:21.440]  by the end of the day. So if you have to pay even a grand as a dumping fee, you're still
[58:21.820 --> 58:25.920]  taking home, you know, nine grand a day or something. I wouldn't trust that dump truck
[58:25.920 --> 58:30.720]  on my patio. I don't think it could support that. That's fair. Looking at the truck. I think it's
[58:30.720 --> 58:36.080]  too big. What if it was if you treated it kind of like an ice cream van where you had like a special
[58:36.080 --> 58:39.880]  dump song that played and as you drove around the neighborhood, people would hear the dump song
[58:39.880 --> 58:45.160]  and come running outside of the chairs and stuff. I really like that as well. Would it be thong song
[58:45.160 --> 58:51.220]  and it's just the dumps like a truck part over and over again? It would just be it would just
[58:51.220 --> 58:59.360]  be Dumb and Dumber them singing Mockingbird over and over and over again. Yeah. Locked in a song.
[59:03.440 --> 59:06.240]  We don't even have a theme song for this podcast yet,
[59:06.240 --> 59:09.300]  but we have a dump truck song. Why don't we have a theme song?
[59:10.060 --> 59:14.360]  We have to probably pick one or something. I don't know. We'll just get the old one. Make one.
[59:15.660 --> 59:20.500]  I don't know. Can we just buy it or something? Well, if we had the rights to it for
[59:21.120 --> 59:24.580]  the other podcast, we still got the rights to it. That is a good point. We now have our rights.
[59:24.600 --> 59:29.800]  We don't have the rights to that song. Yeah, that is not how that works. We definitely no longer
[59:29.800 --> 59:34.880]  have the rights. It is also very expensive. So if you want to make a theme song,
[59:36.500 --> 59:40.380]  let us know, I guess. I made one for So Alright the other day. That was pretty good.
[59:40.740 --> 59:45.460]  Really? What did you use? Hell yeah. Dude, I fucking used my mouth to do it.
[59:46.520 --> 59:53.760]  I'm like a Bobby McFerrin. Yeah. Nick's heard it. Can we get a preview? No, fuck you. All right.
[59:53.860 --> 59:58.040]  Oh, come on. You can't do it right now. Just a little bit. I don't remember it. I don't have it.
[59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.860]  It's already a long episode. We're supposed to talk about our RSS stuff that we should get into
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.580]  that. Let's talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. No, we should have done it 15 minutes ago. No,
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.620]  I'm sorry. I just wanted to revolutionize the dump industry real fast.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.460]  Okay. We can cut all that out and just go to the RSS stuff. If we do dump and dumper,
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:20.760]  I want to drive dumper. Can I be honest with you? I thought you would. Thanks. Yeah. No,
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:24.640]  I was already ready to give it to concede dumper to you. Do I need a special license?
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.080]  We might. We absolutely might. We'll have to look into that. Well,
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.740]  you're going to need any license. What if I only have that license though?
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.960]  I can't drive anything below 16 tons.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.140]  I got a level four commercial license. Do you want to drive my Volvo? Oh, I wish I could.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:56.160]  Oh, Christ. All right. Let's get into it all. I'm excited. Me too. I don't know anything about
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:03.300]  RSS feeds. Eric. No, Gavin's got it. Go ahead, Gavin. Go Gavin. Shut up, Eric. You wanted us
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.660]  to talk about this for the last 45 minutes. No, no, no. I'm not the one who brought it up the
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:12.120]  first time or the second time. I tried to steer it to here. That's it. Okay, who brought it up?
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:20.880]  Take it away, Geoff. Hey, what's up? It's your boy, Lil Geoffy here. We're an hour into the podcast
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.580]  and you're doing introductions. I don't know if you're aware, but Rooster Teeth, the company we
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:33.440]  all used to work for, very recently, very quietly, wasn't well brought... A lot of people didn't hear
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.100]  about it. It certainly wasn't well explained or documented publicly. But that company, Rooster
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:44.660]  Teeth, very quietly closed down in the middle of the night. Nobody saw it coming. Nobody knew.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.600]  We were all caught off guard by it. We certainly didn't have months and months and months of
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.900]  excruciating time to prepare for it. And so as a result of that, our little podcast,
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:02:01.860]  the F*** Face podcast, we lost the rights to because it was owned by Rooster Teeth Productions,
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.680]  because we created it while in the employ of Rooster Teeth Productions.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:12.100]  And so when Rooster Teeth was shut down by Warner Brothers, all of the intellectual property that the
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:17.440]  employees made as employees, or that was owned by the company, became the rights of Warner Brothers,
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:26.280]  who was willing to work with all the individual content creators to... or Rooster Teeth employees
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.880]  that were interested in the IP that they had worked on or created to try to help them acquire
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:39.320]  those rights, I guess, would be the way to say it. And that's a turns out a very long and painful
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.680]  process. And it's not anybody's fault. I don't think any of us were mad at anyone or it wasn't
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:50.620]  us versus Warner Brothers or Rooster Teeth or anything like that. There's a lawyer for every
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:57.400]  lawyer. And everything needs to be checked and cross-checked and spelled out explicitly in
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.500]  contracts and stuff. And some stuff was real easy to get. I got so all right in about 13 minutes.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:11.260]  But F*** Face was a really valuable property for Rooster Teeth. And because of that,
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:18.400]  was more complicated to acquire the rights to. And so we did. But it just took a long time.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:23.600]  It was a double whammy, too, because not only was it profitable enough that it was worth
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.780]  something, it also wasn't like a big heavy hitter, like a Ruby or Red vs. Blue. It's just some dog
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.240]  shit little podcast in the corner. So it didn't necessarily have the priority of the heavy hitter,
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.260]  even though it did require an actual purchase. Right. We're not Death Battle or Ruby or Red
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:43.480]  vs. Blue. We're not that high up on the food chain, but we're high enough on the food chain
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:52.220]  to be on the food chain. And so there was a lot of back and forth and trying to acquire what we
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:57.620]  could and as much as we could. And we're very happy to report that we own the entire back
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:05.000]  catalog of F*** Face. We own the name F*** Face. We own all of the merchandising designs for F*** Face,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.860]  all of the supplemental F*** Face content. We own F*** Face Off, which was the first exclusive show.
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:16.520]  The only stuff we didn't maintain the rights to was the Let's Play content.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.300]  And the song, I guess. And the song. The Let's Play content and the song.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.560]  And we've wanted to talk about it and explain it along the way, and we've been very close.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:31.020]  But it has literally been, for the last, I would say, three weeks, it's all going to be worked out
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.880]  tomorrow. So just wait till tomorrow. And then it's like tomorrow rolls around and we're like,
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.800]  you know, there was one other person had to take a look at something or this got kicked back for
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.900]  this one little thing. So it'll probably be tomorrow. And it's just been tomorrows for
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:49.900]  a couple of weeks. But we're finally through all that. And it was a lot of work on Gavin's end.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.980]  I really appreciate all the work you did, Gavin. You definitely took the lead on that in a lot of
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:05:02.800]  ways. And it means a lot. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Huge for us. Thank you so much.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.740]  It was fun to finally like step up in the final days of the company
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:12.900]  and use my email for like real business. And then in the middle of all that, my email got turned off.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:22.300]  But one of the advantages of having the IP now is we have our old feed, right? So people can now
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:27.780]  listen if they were subscribed to Face. They will now get the regulation pod in that place,
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:35.300]  as well as we offer a ad free version on our Patreon at ten dollars at the extra medium tier.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.920]  The rollout wasn't ideal. You know, we were kind of dealing we were kind of dealing with
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.560]  we were trying to shoot at moving targets all along the way. And, you know, we made some missteps,
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:52.020]  of course. But the most important thing for us was to be there and to be available.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.200]  And not skip a beat. You know, we said that in as many ways as we could over and over again,
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.560]  that we for the audience, we want it to be and clearly it wasn't transparent at all,
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.960]  but we wanted it to be as transparent as possible. You listen to us on one Wednesday,
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.800]  Rooster Teeth goes out of business, regulation spins up. You listen to us the next Wednesday
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.880]  in the same place at the same time, like nothing ever happened. We wanted to make it as easy and
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.260]  seamless as possible on y'all as we could. And we did assume that it would be a shit show.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:22.640]  We did. We just still wanted to do it anyway. And I think even though it wasn't seamless,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.020]  we still didn't have a gap. And I'm I'm super happy about that.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:30.860]  Super happy about it. Yeah, it was it didn't go perfectly, but we didn't expect it to. And we
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:36.780]  just more than anything, we just wanted to be there and making content. And like this is I
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:43.640]  don't know. I hope it comes across. But, you know, this is outside of my family,
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.380]  the flesh and blood of my family. This is the most important thing in my life.
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:58.040]  And I get it means everything to me. And it the idea of stopping would it would it would crush my
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:03.240]  soul. And so I didn't want to stop. I didn't want to stop. I don't want to pause. I didn't want to
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:10.880]  stop for a week, let alone a day. And I would rather deal with the foibles and the little fires
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.380]  that pop up along the way than stop and wait and wait and wait, because if we did that,
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:21.840]  we'd probably be recording episode one today. Oh, God. Yeah, that's probably the thing about
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:28.940]  that. That's terrible. Yeah, no. Can you imagine spending the last five to six weeks totally
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:34.140]  sitting on your hands, not communicating with our audience, not communicating with each other in this
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:38.160]  way, not creating this thing that we're all in love with and obsessed with? Yeah, I couldn't.
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:45.220]  It just wasn't an option. And so thank you so much to the audience, to every comment leaver and
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:50.520]  regulation listener for your patience with us, with our temporary feeds and our temporary solutions
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:56.880]  and following us along the way. Now we have our forever homes. I think the only thing we still
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.100]  would like to do at some point is change the Instagram name, but that's not a huge priority
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:09.900]  today. And I think we're finally settled and in our groove, right? I think as of this episode,
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:15.720]  we're like, we're good. This is the first episode we've recorded 100% good and ready to just move
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:22.980]  forward, kick an ass. Yeah. Hell yeah. Absolutely. So we have our regular where you get the podcast
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:26.600]  and everything channel, but we also have a secondary channel because just because we don't
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.860]  have the rights to our old gameplay didn't mean that we wanted to stop doing gameplay altogether.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:37.300]  So we do have the secondary YouTube channel where all of our gameplay and other things
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:42.380]  will be going. So you can subscribe to both channels and check them both out because we're
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:47.480]  updating frequently. And then there's even more stuff on the Patreon. So it's very exciting and I'm
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:54.220]  very excited to continue to do this stuff with you guys. Hell yeah. You think pre-cum is kind of a
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:09:01.040]  lazy name? Say it again? What? Is what a lazy name? Did you say pre-cum? Pre-cum. He said pre-cum
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.340]  as like a closer, but I've, I'm not done talking. What's lazy about it?
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:10.900]  Just doesn't have its own name. Pre-cum? It's just pre. It's adding pre to a thing.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.260]  It'd be like if you ordered orange juice, but your empty glass is just called pre-juice.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:26.520]  Like you could just technically apply it to everything. Like if tortillas were pre-burrito.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:33.140]  I think technically it would be like if somebody gave you a glass and then walked by and put the
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.780]  tiniest squeeze from an orange in it and said, I'll be back later with the rest.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.000]  Would I put down the first slice for a sandwich? Just a piece of bread?
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.500]  Oh man, I got pre-sandwich everywhere. Oh, the pre-sandwich went moldy.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.720]  I just had to throw away so many pre-sandwiches.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.640]  Oh my God. I will say we should put a bow on our thing. This is one last thing. I have an exciting
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.960]  announcement to make. We're excited about. No, don't say all Christ. It's a genuine. I just don't
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.580]  know what it is. I don't. We don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. We talked about a
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:19.680]  little bit. The cookbook. We have a cookbook that we released a long time ago. Yeah. And people have
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.500]  been wondering about a PDF version. They've been very patient with us. And we've been saying,
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.400]  hey, we're working it out. A lot of that working it out was what we just talked about of like
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:34.260]  all of it was that 100% of it. There's not a little bit of it. There's also now. Now that we
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.460]  have it settled, that is going to become available to all of our patrons for free, no matter what
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:45.300]  tier you're at. $5, $10, whatever. Any of your tiers, you will get that for free. And we're
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.920]  also going to put it up in our shop for $6.99. So if you just want to buy it and you don't want
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:56.640]  to be a patron, totally fine. It will be available as in a PDF form on our Patreon page, which I
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:02.540]  assume we have linked in the description of this podcast. I'm making a note right now to even say
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:08.120]  cookbook is out in PDF form at Patreon.com slash the regulation pod. So enjoy that. It's I love
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.240]  our cookbook so much. I'm so happy that we're able to make that. Geoff, you did such a great job with
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.480]  the photos. The art in it is fantastic. I'm so glad that people that were not able to get the
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.800]  physical version will now have access to a lot of why a lot of wise written words in that book, too.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:31.560]  A lot to pay attention to. I'm also very excited about it. That book was definitely a labor of love
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:39.080]  for Tony, who did the vast majority of the work on it, I think. It was something that we're
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:43.160]  very proud of and excited to be able to share it with more people, you know?
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.860]  Is the regulation podcast just longer than the other one?
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.240]  I don't think so.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:49.000]  Not at all.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.260]  We just had to catch up.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.140]  It's not.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:57.880]  Oh, speaking of which, we should probably wrap it up. We just had that whole serious RSS discussion
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:03.720]  and kind of the explanation to sum up why we've talked around things for the last month and not
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:11.640]  been able to just be 100% open as we go through it. We just couldn't potentially damage any
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:19.760]  negotiations or deals. But I do, in all sincerity, I do want to say a special thank you to Jordan
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:26.820]  and Hannah and Yuri and Hirsch and everybody at Rooster Teeth who, after they got laid off,
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.580]  just like us, stuck around to help negotiate these licensing deals and help us acquire
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:37.360]  our intellectual property. Because that was a lot of work for them. And they definitely didn't have
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:43.440]  to have to care so much as they were also losing their jobs. So I really do appreciate everybody
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.360]  that helped us get our independence.
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:47.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:52.020]  The ability to just text Hannah instead of have to deal directly with someone I've
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.720]  never spoken to at Warner. Absolutely game changing.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:56.460]  Yeah.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.600]  Throughout that whole process.
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:03.460]  And they were just, they were so helpful and kind and seem to genuinely want to help us get
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.840]  our rights. And I just, I really, really, really appreciate it. It would have been so
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.300]  much harder without them. If at all possible, you know.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.700]  What a great episode. It was nice to sync back up. I'm excited for next week.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.940]  Don't even have to wait a full week.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.000]  Are we allowed to call our own episode a great episode?
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.800]  Yeah, I think so. Absolutely.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.540]  Oh, I didn't even get to ask Andrew if he learned his chair.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.120]  Oh, you have to wait till next week. That's a little tease.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.380]  Little tease.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:35.600]  That's a no.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.320]  I love it. That's awesome.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.120]  Definitely. That's definitely a no.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.240]  That's a tease.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.020]  That's a, that's a, oh shit. I have a week to learn my chair now. Christ.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.040]  Big old tease.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.600]  I want to tease that I got a new chair also.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.860]  So there's new chair discussion in the next episode.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.340]  A lot of chair content next episode.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.420]  We'll let you know who learned their chair first. I'm really, really excited.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.820]  Oh, while we're teasing stuff about chairs, I'd like to tease out,
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.620]  here's a tease. Did Geoff get a new chair?
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.200]  Tune in next week to find out. Maybe he did. Probably he didn't.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.220]  You don't know.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.320]  Thanks for listening. Bye.
