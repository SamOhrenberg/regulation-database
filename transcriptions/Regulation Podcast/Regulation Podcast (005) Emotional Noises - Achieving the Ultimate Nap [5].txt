[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  How are you doing, Gavin?
[00:01.560 --> 00:02.480]  Fine, thank you.
[00:04.380 --> 00:05.420]  Alright, there you go.
[00:06.540 --> 00:09.300]  I thought that was a sufficient answer, Gavin.
[00:09.580 --> 00:10.400]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:10.700 --> 00:12.220]  I don't know why that was a weird reaction.
[00:12.640 --> 00:13.540]  Yeah, Geoff.
[00:14.800 --> 00:16.800]  What was weird about my reaction? I just laughed.
[00:17.300 --> 00:19.680]  You guys are comedians being funny. Shouldn't I laugh?
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.240]  Wait, who's being weird? Me or Geoff?
[00:21.880 --> 00:25.460]  I think he's saying I'm being weird because I laughed because I think that you guys are...
[00:25.460 --> 00:29.280]  There was a tone of Gavin's in a bad mood by Geoff with that laugh.
[00:29.280 --> 00:31.360]  I don't think Gavin's in a bad mood at all.
[00:31.540 --> 00:34.760]  I think Gavin's... I just spent like two hours playing video games with him.
[00:34.900 --> 00:37.020]  Gavin was great. What are you talking about?
[00:37.160 --> 00:38.700]  Perfect afternoon so far.
[00:38.780 --> 00:41.200]  Yeah, I'm just saying that that's what the tone that was delivered.
[00:41.380 --> 00:44.880]  Not that that was intentional, but that is how it kind of came across to me.
[00:44.960 --> 00:48.660]  I feel like if anybody's in a bad mood, it's probably the one who's pointing fingers
[00:48.660 --> 00:49.940]  at other people for being in a bad mood.
[00:49.940 --> 00:50.640]  Oh, I'm in a great mood.
[00:50.760 --> 00:52.080]  If I'm being honest with you.
[00:52.100 --> 00:54.640]  I had a 20 minute nap between our gear session.
[00:55.440 --> 00:57.200]  I was in a discord the whole time for it.
[00:57.200 --> 00:58.820]  Is it a bad mood finger pointer?
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.020]  No, I don't think so.
[01:01.180 --> 01:01.700]  I'm just happy.
[01:02.040 --> 01:03.440]  We haven't even started a podcast yet.
[01:03.540 --> 01:04.520]  And Andrew's already started.
[01:04.720 --> 01:05.600]  All right. Should we get to it?
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.080]  I think Nick's in a bad mood.
[01:07.320 --> 01:07.480]  What?
[01:09.720 --> 01:11.940]  No, we fed him this morning for 100% eat.
[01:12.020 --> 01:12.620]  He's in a great mood.
[01:12.780 --> 01:13.740]  Yeah. All right. Here we go.
[01:14.120 --> 01:18.700]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:18.980 --> 01:20.280]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:20.360 --> 01:26.000]  And with me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz and Eric Badour.
[01:27.200 --> 01:30.380]  This episode five, which is a lot more about water.
[01:30.780 --> 01:31.800]  Like I get it.
[01:32.140 --> 01:33.980]  Two hundred and nine or something, maybe.
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.200]  I don't know who can tell.
[01:35.280 --> 01:36.120]  I've learned a thing or two.
[01:36.520 --> 01:37.500]  Yeah. Do you want to go into it?
[01:37.540 --> 01:38.720]  Do you want to tell us everything you learned?
[01:39.120 --> 01:41.600]  Well, it's I I figured it out.
[01:41.680 --> 01:44.120]  I mean, you guys gave a good helping hand last episode.
[01:44.540 --> 01:49.480]  I really pieced it together later myself when I equated it to electricity
[01:50.120 --> 01:52.760]  just because like the electricity, it's always going.
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.200]  If I flip the switch, then it I use it.
[01:56.740 --> 01:57.760]  But it's always there.
[01:57.880 --> 02:01.960]  It's not like I'm creating electricity when I flip the switch, much like water.
[02:02.000 --> 02:02.980]  Water is always going.
[02:03.480 --> 02:05.460]  It's always it's always on the move.
[02:05.700 --> 02:10.860]  Just because I have the thing twisted doesn't mean I'm creating water.
[02:11.200 --> 02:13.200]  It's just I'm pulling from a resource.
[02:14.140 --> 02:16.680]  You thought you were inventing water out of thin air?
[02:17.240 --> 02:18.080]  Like alchemy?
[02:18.260 --> 02:21.340]  Well, no, just like I thought, you know, if I had the thing twisted,
[02:21.360 --> 02:23.700]  I was pulling from the water supply.
[02:24.300 --> 02:27.800]  That wasn't like I was initiating water being created.
[02:27.960 --> 02:29.300]  Essentially, I guess. Yeah.
[02:29.380 --> 02:33.660]  Not that I was creating water, but like I was initiating a pull for water.
[02:33.760 --> 02:35.980]  Like you were requesting water and it was being sent over.
[02:36.160 --> 02:37.380]  Yes, exactly.
[02:37.720 --> 02:41.240]  OK, so you were like you requisitioned water and then they delivered it.
[02:41.360 --> 02:43.320]  Yeah, but that's not how that worked.
[02:43.380 --> 02:47.260]  It's a bunch of doors and it's always actually moving, much like electricity.
[02:47.620 --> 02:49.080]  It's always going.
[02:49.720 --> 02:52.960]  I just flip the switch to tap into what's already there.
[02:52.960 --> 02:55.560]  Not that I am actually creating electricity.
[02:56.020 --> 02:57.160]  You know what as well?
[02:57.560 --> 02:58.940]  What? Gas.
[03:00.040 --> 03:03.220]  Oh, I don't even I don't I can't see it, so I don't want to even get into that.
[03:03.920 --> 03:07.160]  You know, you know what we are creating is magic with this bit.
[03:08.200 --> 03:08.940]  It's not even a bit.
[03:09.100 --> 03:12.580]  That's not a bit because Andrew genuinely doesn't know.
[03:12.820 --> 03:15.660]  I learned a lot about water last week and I just wanted to give an update
[03:15.660 --> 03:17.420]  that I feel like I got my brain around it.
[03:17.600 --> 03:20.080]  And I think we all don't drink the hot tub.
[03:21.780 --> 03:22.860]  Yeah, certainly not.
[03:22.900 --> 03:24.440]  I guess you're kind of right about that.
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.420]  From what I've seen from from people posting and stuff in reaction to that episode.
[03:28.780 --> 03:32.420]  Apparently, in a lot of places, you're drinking rust, dust and rat shit.
[03:32.800 --> 03:35.480]  Yeah, those places are those places are third world countries
[03:35.480 --> 03:36.900]  called the United Kingdom, unfortunately.
[03:38.120 --> 03:39.660]  What do you guys want to talk about today?
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.720]  I mean, I have all sorts of things like talking notes.
[03:43.180 --> 03:44.180]  I learned something.
[03:44.540 --> 03:45.920]  You know, can I extend?
[03:46.180 --> 03:47.460]  I'm learning all sorts of things.
[03:48.100 --> 03:51.340]  I learned that opera music,
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.600]  they're actually saying stuff, and that blew my mind.
[03:54.920 --> 03:57.140]  I had no idea.
[03:57.320 --> 03:59.440]  Yes, that. No, I didn't.
[03:59.560 --> 04:01.240]  Do you think it was fucking sounds?
[04:01.340 --> 04:06.120]  You think it was like, I thought that it was a visual storytelling medium
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.380]  and then they were just like making emotional noises as sort of.
[04:10.700 --> 04:12.220]  I've never really thought about opera.
[04:12.420 --> 04:14.020]  Everyone mimicked. Exactly.
[04:14.900 --> 04:17.280]  I listen. I didn't pursue opera.
[04:17.280 --> 04:21.300]  OK, so I don't I don't have a large breadth of knowledge when it comes to it.
[04:21.620 --> 04:25.640]  I think my biggest exposure to mostly Italian, I think, was Hitman, Blood Money.
[04:25.820 --> 04:26.780]  There's an opera level.
[04:27.620 --> 04:31.080]  And but whenever you hear opera in a thing, they're just always going like,
[04:31.360 --> 04:32.280]  what are we?
[04:33.220 --> 04:35.680]  And I just thought that those were noises.
[04:36.360 --> 04:40.120]  I didn't know that that's that you could translate that.
[04:40.360 --> 04:42.080]  Just a foreign language, dude.
[04:42.300 --> 04:44.060]  It's crazy to go.
[04:44.180 --> 04:45.200]  Yeah, man, they sound like.
[04:45.200 --> 04:53.100]  What about Italy, they were just like, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[04:53.280 --> 04:56.340]  Pizza. Well, I've never seen an English opera.
[04:57.160 --> 05:01.960]  I it fucking I wish you could see my face when I was watching Philadelphia
[05:01.960 --> 05:02.960]  for the first time.
[05:03.060 --> 05:04.580]  And there's that's how I learned this.
[05:04.880 --> 05:08.140]  There's a scene in that movie where Tom Hanks is playing opera
[05:08.140 --> 05:12.700]  for Denzel Washington, and he starts saying what is being sung in English,
[05:12.700 --> 05:13.620]  what the meaning is.
[05:13.620 --> 05:16.400]  And I was it fucking blew my mind.
[05:16.520 --> 05:18.360]  Could you know what?
[05:18.880 --> 05:21.680]  It made me want to get more into opera because it was
[05:21.680 --> 05:24.400]  it seemed like there was quite a bit going on there as far as the story.
[05:25.280 --> 05:26.620]  Like a story. Yeah.
[05:26.940 --> 05:28.580]  Yeah. But why is there English?
[05:28.700 --> 05:30.400]  Is there English opera? Sure.
[05:31.100 --> 05:31.980]  I've really.
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.920]  Why is it always like just Italian people?
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.780]  I mean, I think they invented it, and that's where it's most popular.
[05:40.780 --> 05:42.380]  Um, OK.
[05:43.500 --> 05:45.580]  Can I just say thank you, Andrew?
[05:46.120 --> 05:46.860]  That's opera.
[05:47.280 --> 05:48.520]  Thank you, man.
[05:48.740 --> 05:50.500]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[05:50.820 --> 05:54.660]  I don't think you could be closer to racism without going all the way.
[05:54.840 --> 05:56.340]  No, I just thought it was.
[05:56.460 --> 05:58.300]  I didn't know because it's so loud.
[05:59.060 --> 06:01.860]  I wasn't going to say anything, but you're totally right, Gavin.
[06:02.640 --> 06:04.140]  No, not at all.
[06:05.260 --> 06:06.280]  Oh, man.
[06:06.360 --> 06:07.960]  Anyway, I'm stereotyping that.
[06:08.040 --> 06:08.700]  I just didn't know.
[06:08.700 --> 06:11.340]  You just keep doing an impression.
[06:13.180 --> 06:14.800]  It's not helping your case.
[06:14.900 --> 06:16.260]  Does it not sound like opera?
[06:16.980 --> 06:18.940]  It. No.
[06:20.960 --> 06:22.980]  Oh, it sounds like
[06:23.540 --> 06:26.540]  sort of like five rows back from me, a football game.
[06:27.100 --> 06:28.640]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[06:29.100 --> 06:30.580]  You know what? That last one did.
[06:30.860 --> 06:31.160]  I'll agree.
[06:31.160 --> 06:35.040]  Oh, seen in a bar.
[06:38.840 --> 06:41.720]  Is this what it sounds like to hang out with your grandpa, Gavin?
[06:42.720 --> 06:44.440]  It's like being back home.
[06:46.720 --> 06:49.680]  This is the deleted scenes of that Skype commercial.
[06:50.520 --> 06:51.720]  It's the real shit.
[06:52.300 --> 06:53.680]  They kept them to get to stop singing.
[06:54.520 --> 06:57.320]  So anyway, that's I'm sure there are other people out there like me
[06:57.320 --> 06:58.960]  that didn't know that opera was words.
[06:59.460 --> 07:00.480]  All right, let's get a poll going.
[07:00.480 --> 07:06.100]  Yeah. How many minds did Andrew just blow in the way that he thinks he blew them?
[07:07.440 --> 07:12.940]  We should just pop a poll that says what language is opera Italian or blah, blah, blah, blah.
[07:13.900 --> 07:17.140]  Is Italian opera language or noise?
[07:17.340 --> 07:21.000]  That implies that I had an understanding it was language at all.
[07:21.080 --> 07:25.200]  As I said, I thought it was just supposed to be like emotional noises.
[07:27.520 --> 07:31.040]  What is the most what's the most emotional noise you've heard?
[07:33.660 --> 07:35.640]  That sounds like you're singing La Bamba.
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.880]  You're my favorite. Yeah.
[07:45.220 --> 07:47.900]  That's I mean, that's pretty special, man.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.260]  That's pretty. I know it's special.
[07:50.380 --> 07:53.220]  I just learned that there's a whole fucking story to all these songs.
[07:53.780 --> 07:55.180]  I can go back. I can figure it out.
[07:55.700 --> 07:56.680]  I don't know what these are.
[07:57.160 --> 08:00.360]  I want to know what what's happening in the hitman blood money level.
[08:00.480 --> 08:02.160]  I want to know what those words are.
[08:02.200 --> 08:05.900]  That when when you like swap the gun and the shoots the guy, you could.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.680]  Yeah, it's like a World War two thing or something where it's
[08:09.680 --> 08:13.060]  you can swap the pistol and have them accidentally
[08:13.060 --> 08:15.380]  like kill him on stage while they're performing.
[08:15.920 --> 08:19.080]  And then you can drop the chandelier on the guy when he's running over to like be
[08:19.080 --> 08:20.800]  oh my God, to like react to it.
[08:21.300 --> 08:24.100]  I'd never even crossed my mind that there is a thing to translate there.
[08:24.100 --> 08:25.920]  But I need to go do that.
[08:27.220 --> 08:27.980]  And that's what I learned.
[08:28.580 --> 08:30.360]  I don't think I learned anything else.
[08:31.100 --> 08:31.820]  I had a question.
[08:33.120 --> 08:35.940]  When does the trail cease to be a trail?
[08:36.700 --> 08:38.600]  When do you just have a nut mix?
[08:39.220 --> 08:42.140]  What is the requirement of the trail for the trail mix?
[08:42.660 --> 08:46.180]  So so when you don't lead off with your talking about trail mix,
[08:46.240 --> 08:48.300]  it sounds like you're talking about a trail.
[08:50.140 --> 08:52.220]  Well, how wide does a track?
[08:52.220 --> 08:53.960]  It's a road. Right.
[08:54.080 --> 08:55.280]  That's what I thought he was getting at.
[08:55.380 --> 08:58.000]  And then he said, what if it's just nuts?
[08:58.420 --> 09:00.260]  Well, I think that's got to be what it's from.
[09:00.400 --> 09:01.920]  It's going to be from people on trails.
[09:02.460 --> 09:04.600]  Well, yeah, that's how it was invented.
[09:04.920 --> 09:08.480]  Yeah, it's like safe food to take with you on the trail that you can eat
[09:08.480 --> 09:09.400]  to get boosts of energy.
[09:09.660 --> 09:12.860]  But trail mix, it's like saying when is ice cream, not ice cream.
[09:12.940 --> 09:14.960]  It's as long as it exists, this trail mix.
[09:15.620 --> 09:18.020]  But there's nut mixes that are certainly not trail mix.
[09:18.020 --> 09:19.240]  Or is it all trail mix?
[09:20.420 --> 09:21.360]  Oh, I see.
[09:22.400 --> 09:25.780]  So like if it's just a bowl of nuts, that's that's not trail mix.
[09:25.920 --> 09:26.620]  There has to be other stuff.
[09:26.920 --> 09:31.240]  Like like if you take out croutons, is it still a Caesar salad?
[09:31.340 --> 09:34.200]  Yeah, just lettuce and it's just lettuce.
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.100]  Well, like, yeah, I feel like the dressing probably plays a big role there.
[09:38.340 --> 09:43.860]  But I was eating just the M&M's out of my trail mix the other day,
[09:43.860 --> 09:45.280]  and I devoured them.
[09:45.600 --> 09:49.080]  I don't think M&M's were originally a part of trail mix.
[09:49.080 --> 09:51.900]  Also, you're just eating the M&M's out of your trail mix.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.360]  You're just eating M&M's.
[09:53.540 --> 09:54.620]  That's the dilemma.
[09:54.820 --> 09:57.540]  But there were like I wasn't, though it was trail mix.
[09:57.880 --> 10:00.320]  I don't think there's any hard and fast rule.
[10:00.500 --> 10:05.000]  It just says as long as you're adding equal parts of nuts, seeds and dried fruit,
[10:05.420 --> 10:06.500]  you're probably good.
[10:06.500 --> 10:09.040]  And then maybe a half part of chocolate chips.
[10:09.540 --> 10:11.900]  It's kind of like whatever you make it, I guess.
[10:11.940 --> 10:14.340]  That's fair. I was just curious if you guys had opinions.
[10:14.780 --> 10:16.560]  So I wasn't sure what I was eating at that point.
[10:16.560 --> 10:17.940]  Once I finished all the chocolate.
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.860]  I was like, is this just a nut mix?
[10:21.420 --> 10:22.160]  There are there.
[10:22.380 --> 10:24.580]  We got raisins in the blend.
[10:25.140 --> 10:28.260]  No, it's just it's just what's left of the trail mix.
[10:28.740 --> 10:30.500]  What's a better mix trail or Bombay?
[10:31.440 --> 10:32.700]  What's a Bombay mix?
[10:32.920 --> 10:33.960]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[10:34.020 --> 10:36.400]  Oh, man, it's so good.
[10:36.480 --> 10:37.360]  The Bombay mix.
[10:37.680 --> 10:40.080]  I don't trust it if I don't know what it is.
[10:40.100 --> 10:41.040]  And you're saying it's good.
[10:41.220 --> 10:44.080]  Trust the frickin shotgun in Gears of War.
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.520]  I don't trust a lot of things.
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.120]  Oh, this is like the this is like the weird trail mix where it's got like
[10:50.740 --> 10:52.660]  like the I got you. I got you.
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.840]  I don't think you're allowed to call Bombay mix weird trail mix either.
[10:56.040 --> 10:58.680]  This is just so culturally offensive.
[10:59.680 --> 11:00.660]  I like that. That's good.
[11:01.100 --> 11:03.800]  Oh, I mean, this is good in a totally different way.
[11:03.920 --> 11:06.520]  Like I wouldn't have said I'd rather have trail mix than that.
[11:06.560 --> 11:07.220]  But it is good.
[11:07.580 --> 11:09.520]  Yeah. Like there's no M&Ms in this.
[11:09.540 --> 11:10.080]  So what's the point?
[11:10.220 --> 11:11.540]  You know, Nick just said it's fine.
[11:11.600 --> 11:12.200]  What does that mean?
[11:12.620 --> 11:13.940]  Oof. What do you mean?
[11:14.040 --> 11:15.000]  Well, I don't think he likes it.
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.840]  It's fine. It's not as good as a regular trail mix.
[11:18.180 --> 11:19.900]  It's like spicy trail mix.
[11:19.980 --> 11:21.460]  It's amazing. It's incredible.
[11:21.480 --> 11:23.260]  I'm on the trail, though. It's going to be hot.
[11:23.760 --> 11:24.860]  I don't see any raisins.
[11:25.340 --> 11:27.080]  Yeah, I don't see chocolate.
[11:27.420 --> 11:31.000]  Yeah, like I don't want raisins in anything, to be honest.
[11:31.500 --> 11:33.060]  Really? You're not a raisin guy at all.
[11:33.160 --> 11:35.400]  Big part of trail mix, though, is it?
[11:36.460 --> 11:39.260]  I guess this is a savory trail mix, and I could get behind that.
[11:39.640 --> 11:42.500]  Seems seems weird to have something hot and spicy when you're on a hike.
[11:43.200 --> 11:46.720]  Bits and bites is probably my preferred savory trail mix.
[11:47.980 --> 11:51.160]  Yeah. Is that not a is that a Canadian thing?
[11:52.260 --> 11:53.760]  You have to post it.
[11:53.960 --> 11:57.800]  We're going to we're like six bags away from having a trail off.
[11:58.700 --> 12:01.380]  Bits and bites is you got the squares,
[12:01.640 --> 12:04.720]  you got the pretzel sticks, you got the Cheerios
[12:05.360 --> 12:07.140]  and you got little cheese sticks.
[12:07.800 --> 12:08.720]  Thank you. Bites.
[12:09.500 --> 12:11.860]  Yeah, there's different variations of breakfast in there.
[12:11.860 --> 12:14.600]  Oh, my God, it's cereal.
[12:15.420 --> 12:19.120]  Just like probably the stuff that fell off the conveyor belt of the cereal factory.
[12:21.320 --> 12:22.800]  No, it's it's we don't.
[12:22.900 --> 12:27.760]  The move is it's a bag of leftovers or delicious leftovers.
[12:28.060 --> 12:29.800]  First of all, leftovers are great.
[12:29.900 --> 12:30.700]  I just want to say that.
[12:30.760 --> 12:32.720]  I feel like that was said in a negative tone.
[12:33.300 --> 12:36.180]  It's you can go into a lot of good things, leftovers.
[12:37.040 --> 12:41.120]  But the move with the bits and bites is you get the pretzel stick
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.120]  and then you you cover it in the Cheerios, you fill it, you circle it.
[12:46.280 --> 12:47.940]  So it's end to end Cheerio.
[12:48.060 --> 12:48.900]  And then you bite that.
[12:49.080 --> 12:50.400]  And that's that's the spot.
[12:51.160 --> 12:52.020]  That's the move.
[12:52.940 --> 12:54.900]  I can't believe y'all don't have bits and bites.
[12:56.200 --> 12:58.360]  I wonder if it's called Mumbai mix now.
[13:01.220 --> 13:02.520]  You think they rebranded?
[13:02.920 --> 13:04.880]  All right. It's not Bombay anymore, is it?
[13:06.760 --> 13:07.860]  We love that candy.
[13:07.860 --> 13:13.260]  This is the this is the culturally insensitive episode.
[13:13.640 --> 13:16.380]  I have found something called Mumbai mix, but I don't.
[13:16.500 --> 13:17.260]  But it's not prevalent.
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.960]  Huh? Yeah.
[13:19.500 --> 13:21.260]  The most of our Bombay mix. Sorry.
[13:22.020 --> 13:24.540]  I wonder if you're ahead of the curve on that, Gavin, or if it's
[13:24.540 --> 13:26.160]  it's just never going to be.
[13:26.220 --> 13:29.040]  Yeah, I was just asking a genuine question.
[13:30.480 --> 13:32.840]  Andrew, you were saying what's the candy equivalent to the.
[13:33.120 --> 13:35.900]  Yeah, I was curious if there is a candy trail mix.
[13:35.900 --> 13:37.780]  Have you seen candy salad?
[13:38.840 --> 13:40.020]  Oh, yeah, I've seen those. Yeah.
[13:40.420 --> 13:41.980]  Yeah. People making those.
[13:42.740 --> 13:44.540]  Oh, it's like half of my worms and dirt.
[13:47.300 --> 13:51.080]  I don't understand what you make the candy salad.
[13:51.460 --> 13:53.740]  How do you then distribute the candy salad?
[13:54.600 --> 13:55.700]  Salad tongs.
[13:57.020 --> 13:59.260]  Like this big, big spoon.
[14:00.440 --> 14:01.360]  But it's.
[14:01.740 --> 14:02.760]  How do you distribute salad?
[14:02.880 --> 14:03.380]  I hate that.
[14:03.700 --> 14:05.440]  I hate that so much that.
[14:05.440 --> 14:07.100]  Would you prefer like a chocolate tongue?
[14:08.260 --> 14:11.520]  I just don't want your fingers in my, in my.
[14:11.660 --> 14:12.980]  The fingers are on the bowl.
[14:13.460 --> 14:15.980]  There's no fingers in the in the candy.
[14:16.140 --> 14:17.420]  Look at that thumb.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.260]  Anyone who can see the image of the show.
[14:20.280 --> 14:21.020]  The thumb not touching candy?
[14:21.560 --> 14:25.420]  That thumb is on the inside and they are scooping that way.
[14:25.680 --> 14:28.400]  You cannot tell me that thumb is not getting in the mix.
[14:29.040 --> 14:31.380]  I mean, they should be using another spoon.
[14:31.620 --> 14:34.080]  Yeah. But I think that's fine.
[14:34.740 --> 14:39.160]  My issue is not necessarily what I meant is whenever I see these,
[14:39.260 --> 14:43.580]  there's 50 pounds of candy that they put into an open dish.
[14:43.940 --> 14:45.640]  And then it's like, what are you going to do with it?
[14:45.660 --> 14:49.720]  Also, it's just layered in a way that you're not going to enjoy
[14:49.720 --> 14:51.540]  a mix of everybody's thing.
[14:52.040 --> 14:54.640]  You're just doing one section at a time.
[14:54.980 --> 14:58.420]  It is not like a variety where I feel like the joy of a trail mix
[14:58.420 --> 15:01.240]  is you get a little bit of peanut, get a little bit of cashew.
[15:01.540 --> 15:03.120]  Well, that's just depending on how it's mixed.
[15:03.700 --> 15:07.920]  I'm just telling you that if you toss your candy salad, it's probably fine.
[15:09.460 --> 15:11.400]  Do you toss your candy salad, Gavin?
[15:13.720 --> 15:16.900]  You're complaining about this with all the same issues
[15:16.900 --> 15:21.140]  that a regular salad has that we've solved hundreds of years ago by tossing it.
[15:21.860 --> 15:23.660]  But it's no different than a salad.
[15:23.780 --> 15:25.460]  Use the same salad tongs. No.
[15:25.700 --> 15:26.820]  And just mix it up.
[15:27.080 --> 15:28.640]  Not even salad, just mixing.
[15:28.780 --> 15:29.960]  It's the concept of mixing.
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.700]  No. OK. First of all, I'm dealing with a bunch of candy amateurs over here.
[15:34.760 --> 15:38.440]  So it sounds like you try mixing that gummy bowl.
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.760]  Good luck. Give me that bowl.
[15:40.980 --> 15:44.260]  I'll I'll mix that. With tongs? Easily. Easily.
[15:44.660 --> 15:46.960]  Oh, my God. Yeah, I'll get you. It could have mixed.
[15:47.160 --> 15:48.520]  No, it is. You do not.
[15:48.640 --> 15:51.080]  It is hard to mix a bowl of heavy gummy.
[15:52.300 --> 15:54.220]  I think you're greatly.
[15:55.740 --> 15:58.800]  You're insane. It's going to stick to each other.
[15:58.800 --> 16:00.820]  It's not going to want like a salad.
[16:01.020 --> 16:05.400]  You can just throw that lettuce around and it bounces and different things in it.
[16:06.300 --> 16:09.580]  Gummies have weight to them and they're hard to mix around.
[16:12.220 --> 16:14.240]  I could mix that so well.
[16:14.700 --> 16:16.880]  No, you could. Next episode.
[16:17.420 --> 16:18.320]  Bring the clip.
[16:18.860 --> 16:20.000]  You love bringing clips.
[16:20.140 --> 16:23.480]  Bring me a clip of you mixing a big bowl of candy.
[16:23.640 --> 16:25.580]  I don't want to buy all that junk. I hate eating it.
[16:25.640 --> 16:26.600]  It's just going to be wasted.
[16:26.980 --> 16:28.980]  Oh, yeah. I'll give it to Geoff.
[16:29.100 --> 16:30.560]  I can't eat any of that shit anymore.
[16:30.820 --> 16:32.840]  I'm not. I'm not. I got to take care of these teeth.
[16:33.260 --> 16:34.400]  Yeah. Nick, Eric.
[16:35.160 --> 16:37.000]  You want to eat my tossed salad? Nick's.
[16:37.100 --> 16:39.700]  OK, there's got to stop saying that.
[16:39.920 --> 16:41.160]  Nick has a kid. No, that makes sense.
[16:41.760 --> 16:42.120]  What?
[16:42.820 --> 16:43.780]  Nick's got to think of his future. You have a kid.
[16:43.960 --> 16:45.160]  Your kid would love this.
[16:45.260 --> 16:46.960]  Come on. A kid would love a candy salad.
[16:47.180 --> 16:48.900]  Yeah. And he must be protected from this.
[16:50.040 --> 16:51.760]  Yeah. Defamination. Exactly.
[16:52.020 --> 16:55.980]  Yeah. If Nick's kid, if Nick's kid has this, he'll become Nick.
[16:55.980 --> 16:58.560]  And Nick has to do everything he can to stop that.
[16:58.840 --> 17:00.600]  Yeah. Wake up tomorrow morning with monkey ears.
[17:01.040 --> 17:01.400]  Oh no!
[17:03.180 --> 17:08.880]  I never thought about Nick being like a fucking werewolf.
[17:09.140 --> 17:10.980]  Like something happened to him at some point.
[17:11.600 --> 17:14.720]  And this he's been cursed by this.
[17:14.940 --> 17:17.220]  Is that not the canon of 100% eat?
[17:17.320 --> 17:19.320]  Like Nick eats the food and becomes the monkey?
[17:19.580 --> 17:22.820]  Or is he just showing up as I assume some sort of transformation
[17:23.480 --> 17:25.660]  like barbecue fueled monkeyism?
[17:26.020 --> 17:28.660]  No, that's literally Nick is just a man in a mask.
[17:28.760 --> 17:30.180]  That's all it is. Yeah.
[17:31.640 --> 17:34.580]  Oh, that's why we always made sure when we made merch,
[17:34.660 --> 17:36.560]  you always have to be able to see his human eyes
[17:36.560 --> 17:39.120]  because you have to remember there's a man in there.
[17:39.180 --> 17:41.680]  Yeah. Yeah. Somewhere.
[17:42.140 --> 17:44.420]  A weird man. Yeah. Oh, definitely.
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.680]  So, Geoff, you tossing any salads or what's going on?
[17:46.700 --> 17:48.620]  Yeah. I want to know Geoff's favorite trail mix.
[17:48.800 --> 17:49.540]  What do we got in there?
[17:50.180 --> 17:54.180]  Oh, I don't give a shit. I don't I'll be I'll be honest with you.
[17:54.180 --> 17:57.760]  I don't really care that much one way or the other about trail mix.
[17:58.440 --> 18:02.560]  It's hard for me to muster up even to the pretend enthusiasm.
[18:04.140 --> 18:06.380]  I don't really give a shit about chocolate chips.
[18:06.500 --> 18:09.760]  So I guess I'd go butterscotch because I like that a little bit better.
[18:10.480 --> 18:12.860]  I like raisins, any kind of raisin.
[18:12.920 --> 18:14.360]  I'd actually over index on raisins.
[18:14.480 --> 18:15.800]  I take the raisins nobody else wants.
[18:16.480 --> 18:19.480]  Sunflower seeds, maybe some pumpkin seeds.
[18:19.640 --> 18:20.920]  And then any form of nut.
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.400]  I don't like cashews, any other nut.
[18:22.860 --> 18:25.740]  Definitely peanuts that people people fuck up and don't put enough peanuts.
[18:25.960 --> 18:27.260]  You don't like cashews?
[18:27.820 --> 18:29.120]  Now cashews are boring to me.
[18:29.220 --> 18:30.420]  It's a lower it's a bottom tier nut.
[18:30.560 --> 18:31.420]  What about a pistachio?
[18:31.640 --> 18:32.760]  I like pistachios.
[18:32.880 --> 18:34.560]  I like all nuts, but cashews.
[18:34.740 --> 18:36.260]  Cashews are a treat to me.
[18:36.260 --> 18:37.340]  Cashews are yeah, they're delicious.
[18:38.040 --> 18:40.180]  Now cashews is like, I'm not into it.
[18:40.680 --> 18:41.500]  I like your trail mix.
[18:41.740 --> 18:42.760]  They're like a creamy nut.
[18:43.320 --> 18:44.340]  They are a creamy nut.
[18:44.560 --> 18:48.060]  Yeah, it's like what you get on American Airlines flights when you want real nuts.
[18:48.240 --> 18:48.680]  I hate it.
[18:48.720 --> 18:50.000]  You can have your creamy nut salad.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.780]  Tarz Gavin, is that what we're getting at?
[18:52.040 --> 18:52.600]  We're getting some smut?
[18:52.880 --> 18:54.860]  All right, we get some smut in here.
[18:55.220 --> 18:56.780]  There's a certain era that we're heading back towards.
[18:56.960 --> 18:57.420]  I don't want to.
[18:57.760 --> 19:00.460]  Hey, you know, you know what might happen this month or next month?
[19:01.080 --> 19:01.440]  What?
[19:01.760 --> 19:02.660]  It might be coming home.
[19:04.640 --> 19:05.800]  Oh, do you really?
[19:06.080 --> 19:06.780]  Are we going to?
[19:07.340 --> 19:07.980]  Here's the thing.
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.640]  I want to ask you to do a stream of that again.
[19:10.640 --> 19:14.420]  But also, I want you to be able to enjoy the thing that you want to enjoy
[19:14.420 --> 19:16.660]  and not have to monetize everything that we do.
[19:16.980 --> 19:18.200]  We could all watch it together.
[19:18.660 --> 19:19.700]  I would love. I would love.
[19:19.720 --> 19:21.280]  I would love to watch that with you.
[19:21.400 --> 19:21.920]  I would love to.
[19:21.980 --> 19:22.520]  When is it?
[19:23.060 --> 19:25.220]  I think the final is going to be in July.
[19:25.700 --> 19:27.160]  Oh, that's a bad month for me.
[19:27.840 --> 19:28.700]  What does that mean?
[19:30.880 --> 19:31.980]  I'll get him to move it.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.240]  Yeah, I hope I hope it comes.
[19:35.360 --> 19:38.020]  I hope it comes home and I hope it comes home for the Celtics, too,
[19:38.100 --> 19:40.120]  who I'm going to go see play this weekend for the NBA.
[19:40.200 --> 19:41.740]  That's crazy, dude. That's so cool.
[19:41.960 --> 19:42.740]  Yeah, I'm very excited.
[19:43.060 --> 19:45.120]  When I was in England just now, I promised
[19:46.660 --> 19:49.060]  I promised my family of England won the Euros.
[19:49.160 --> 19:50.260]  I'd move back to England.
[19:51.200 --> 19:53.060]  Oh, you're insane.
[19:53.680 --> 19:55.160]  What are you doing?
[19:55.420 --> 19:56.960]  OK, well, no, no, no.
[19:57.160 --> 19:59.600]  Here, here. Is there a stature statute?
[19:59.840 --> 20:00.840]  What stature statute?
[20:01.140 --> 20:02.560]  A limitations on that?
[20:02.600 --> 20:03.540]  When do you have to do that?
[20:04.320 --> 20:06.640]  Like, like, you can do it 50 years from now, right?
[20:06.640 --> 20:08.280]  Like, and you're still fulfilling the obligation.
[20:08.520 --> 20:10.260]  I wasn't specific on timeline, I guess.
[20:10.340 --> 20:11.480]  But yeah, well, that's fine.
[20:11.740 --> 20:13.640]  I did. I feel like that changes nothing.
[20:14.100 --> 20:15.780]  I did shake on it.
[20:17.140 --> 20:18.280]  Legally binding now.
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.320]  Who did you make this bet with?
[20:20.420 --> 20:21.700]  What's the other half of the bet?
[20:22.480 --> 20:23.220]  Yeah, what do you win?
[20:23.540 --> 20:24.000]  Yeah, what do you win?
[20:24.220 --> 20:26.980]  And he's not allowed to ever visit again.
[20:27.160 --> 20:27.280]  There's nothing.
[20:28.480 --> 20:29.980]  I've gone about this the wrong way.
[20:30.160 --> 20:32.800]  I just made a bet with my siblings and my family.
[20:33.380 --> 20:34.580]  What's their team again?
[20:35.300 --> 20:35.800]  How about this?
[20:35.960 --> 20:38.760]  You tell your brother you'll move back to England when he does.
[20:40.060 --> 20:40.360]  Yeah.
[20:41.320 --> 20:46.120]  I'm just imagining you and your family dining room cutting a Chael Sutton promo against England.
[20:46.240 --> 20:48.980]  England, you absolutely suck.
[20:49.740 --> 20:50.520]  You win.
[20:51.140 --> 20:52.460]  I move back here.
[20:52.800 --> 20:54.020]  You lose.
[20:55.100 --> 20:56.440]  I'll never visit again.
[20:56.760 --> 20:58.520]  Apparently the odds are pretty good, though.
[20:58.600 --> 20:59.960]  It's like a really strong team.
[21:00.820 --> 21:02.800]  I don't think it matters based on what you've said.
[21:04.180 --> 21:06.360]  I'm going to have to record this at 9pm every Thursday.
[21:06.860 --> 21:08.260]  Oh my god.
[21:10.060 --> 21:11.620]  We have to find another British person.
[21:11.900 --> 21:13.640]  Eric, can you put an ad in the...
[21:13.640 --> 21:13.920]  I don't know.
[21:14.060 --> 21:15.440]  Do we put Craigslist, I guess?
[21:15.660 --> 21:16.180]  Do people still do that?
[21:16.180 --> 21:17.200]  Is that where you want me to put it?
[21:17.260 --> 21:19.140]  You want me to put an ad for a British person in Craigslist?
[21:19.240 --> 21:20.040]  Or like Indeed?
[21:20.300 --> 21:21.100]  Do people use Indeed?
[21:21.520 --> 21:23.140]  Is that what we do? Monster.com?
[21:23.220 --> 21:23.660]  How do you do it?
[21:23.660 --> 21:26.880]  Why don't we just shoot Toad in the hole first and then we'll get some contact.
[21:27.020 --> 21:27.500]  Oh, OK.
[21:27.520 --> 21:29.060]  We'll have to try some different British people on.
[21:29.540 --> 21:33.600]  Whoever Gavin hates the most for being British, we'll have as our new British person.
[21:33.700 --> 21:34.960]  What's James Buckley up to?
[21:35.060 --> 21:35.560]  Can we get him?
[21:36.680 --> 21:37.480]  He's a busy guy.
[21:38.980 --> 21:40.880]  Do people still use Craigslist?
[21:42.440 --> 21:43.460]  I think so.
[21:43.460 --> 21:49.080]  If you need to buy a used car or some shitty furniture, I think that's it.
[21:49.540 --> 21:54.540]  I've been on a Denzel Washington movie kick where I just have been putting his name into streaming services
[21:54.540 --> 21:56.460]  and then watching whatever pops up.
[21:56.860 --> 22:00.600]  And the end, I had never seen any of the Equalizer films.
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.220]  And the end of the first Equalizer sets up him
[22:05.220 --> 22:08.220]  becoming a crime fighter through Craigslist.
[22:08.420 --> 22:10.580]  And I thought that was fucking insane.
[22:10.760 --> 22:14.200]  Like the I just I feel like and I could be completely wrong
[22:14.200 --> 22:19.060]  that Craigslist is not nearly as like a known thing anymore is used.
[22:19.360 --> 22:24.860]  And I may be feeling that way because of how shitty the UI and design of that website is.
[22:25.160 --> 22:29.720]  But he was like he made an ad on Craigslist that was like, hey, you need help.
[22:29.760 --> 22:31.240]  And the person's like, yeah, I need help.
[22:31.260 --> 22:33.920]  And it ends with him replying like, I got you, bro.
[22:33.920 --> 22:37.160]  And then and then they wrap it up and they never address it again.
[22:37.220 --> 22:40.460]  It doesn't come up. He has a new system in the second film.
[22:40.940 --> 22:41.980]  But when did that movie come out?
[22:42.580 --> 22:45.280]  That's a great question. Maybe like 2010 ish.
[22:45.360 --> 22:47.740]  Well, there you go. That's the age of Craigslist.
[22:48.080 --> 22:50.680]  Really? I thought the age of Craigslist was like 2000.
[22:51.900 --> 22:53.500]  No, really? No. OK.
[22:53.620 --> 22:57.260]  I found out I found like the first like house that I moved out to on Craigslist,
[22:57.360 --> 23:00.480]  the car that I bought on Craigslist, the other car that I bought on Craigslist.
[23:00.480 --> 23:05.820]  In 2014, we were just starting to switch from like
[23:05.820 --> 23:09.760]  all dot binaries, dot Austin, dot for sale or whatever
[23:12.060 --> 23:13.640]  newsgroups over to Craigslist.
[23:13.800 --> 23:15.220]  We were just we were just making the transition.
[23:15.860 --> 23:20.140]  I think I thought that because Craigslist looks like all of those websites.
[23:20.700 --> 23:22.500]  It looks like it was made at that time.
[23:22.540 --> 23:25.620]  Like it looks like the guy that made Ask Jeeves
[23:25.620 --> 23:28.840]  that immediately went on to make the Craigslist site.
[23:30.380 --> 23:31.180]  Hmm. Yeah.
[23:31.260 --> 23:37.500]  I guess there's no thrill, frills, frills, thrills, frills, frills.
[23:37.540 --> 23:40.100]  It's a it's a no frills kind of site. Yeah, for sure.
[23:40.240 --> 23:43.320]  There there are plenty of thrills, though, if you just. Oh, God.
[23:43.540 --> 23:45.000]  You don't have to. You don't have to go that far.
[23:45.100 --> 23:47.960]  A lot of you get to watch you to fuck up a dude on that site.
[23:48.100 --> 23:51.180]  It's crazy. Well, 14 years ago, you could.
[23:51.680 --> 23:52.840]  Yeah, you could. Oh, yeah.
[23:53.240 --> 23:55.700]  10 years ago. What have you been up to, Geoff?
[23:56.580 --> 23:58.900]  Oh, man, I I had a bunch of stuff.
[23:58.960 --> 24:03.120]  I had a new idea that I think is going to revolutionize the world.
[24:04.140 --> 24:08.680]  I had a little thing that I discovered recently that I'll go back with you.
[24:09.040 --> 24:10.320]  Hang on. No, no, no, hang on.
[24:10.440 --> 24:14.820]  No, we have to keep going because there's there's even stuff that Geoff said.
[24:14.860 --> 24:16.800]  You'll never believe what I did again.
[24:16.880 --> 24:18.320]  You know? Oh, yeah.
[24:18.840 --> 24:20.740]  And I don't know what that is either.
[24:21.080 --> 24:24.740]  Well, I had to I had two very embarrassing things happen.
[24:24.740 --> 24:25.960]  Well, I shouldn't say happen to me.
[24:26.060 --> 24:28.240]  I did two very embarrassing things to myself recently.
[24:28.600 --> 24:30.360]  So those are two different stories I could tell.
[24:30.480 --> 24:31.660]  I don't know that we need to, though.
[24:31.700 --> 24:35.380]  We already had one really embarrassing story with Andrew admitting that he's
[24:35.380 --> 24:37.160]  racist against Italians in the opera.
[24:37.940 --> 24:41.240]  And so I just I don't want to over index on embarrassing.
[24:41.420 --> 24:44.020]  So maybe we'll shelve those and save them for down the road or something.
[24:44.640 --> 24:45.340]  Mario's pretty cool.
[24:47.160 --> 24:49.300]  I want to know what you put it in the slack.
[24:49.380 --> 24:50.380]  I want to know what you did.
[24:50.800 --> 24:52.380]  Yeah, you told us you put it in the slack.
[24:52.540 --> 24:53.560]  You teed it up.
[24:53.560 --> 24:55.220]  Because here are things that have happened before.
[24:55.580 --> 24:56.920]  You've shit yourself.
[24:57.040 --> 25:00.540]  Yeah. No, I think I don't think you'd be embarrassed about sharing.
[25:00.680 --> 25:01.760]  You've broken a tooth.
[25:02.840 --> 25:04.960]  Here, I'm going to put a video up that Emily took.
[25:05.120 --> 25:06.580]  This is yesterday. Oh, my God.
[25:07.360 --> 25:09.780]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[25:11.180 --> 25:13.840]  You've got to be kidding me.
[25:15.300 --> 25:17.460]  Dude, come on. How?
[25:19.280 --> 25:21.380]  Why do you keep doing this?
[25:23.060 --> 25:26.280]  So if you've watched the video at home, you probably haven't seen the video.
[25:26.280 --> 25:28.360]  So you're reattaching a gas hose.
[25:28.480 --> 25:31.860]  Dropping it to Gas Olivia Hood.
[25:32.280 --> 25:33.260]  Oh, my God.
[25:33.440 --> 25:36.140]  I got covered in gas.
[25:36.680 --> 25:38.060]  You've got to stop doing it.
[25:38.080 --> 25:39.880]  You've got to stop driving away.
[25:40.320 --> 25:41.740]  So yesterday...
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.340]  How is this happening?
[25:44.740 --> 25:45.360]  What are you doing?
[25:47.220 --> 25:48.360]  What's your problem?
[25:51.380 --> 25:51.780]  How?
[25:54.940 --> 25:58.800]  So yesterday, I stopped at a gas station with my wife and daughter.
[25:59.300 --> 26:03.020]  And we started filling up Emily's car.
[26:03.940 --> 26:06.180]  I'm proud to say this has never happened in my car.
[26:06.300 --> 26:07.160]  I'm always driving her car.
[26:07.820 --> 26:09.640]  We were filling up Emily's car.
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.600]  And we decided to go in for Slurpees.
[26:11.940 --> 26:14.060]  And then it just took a long time inside.
[26:14.240 --> 26:14.940]  We were getting snacks.
[26:15.060 --> 26:18.240]  And when we came all out, we all just jumped in the car and drove away.
[26:18.320 --> 26:19.340]  And then I heard a kathunk.
[26:19.340 --> 26:22.600]  And then Emily and Millie said, Oh, my God, no.
[26:22.720 --> 26:24.820]  And I stopped and I backed up and I looked.
[26:24.960 --> 26:28.520]  And I had driven away with the gas hose still in the car.
[26:29.040 --> 26:34.500]  And this time, I stuck around to see that I ripped it out of the gas pump.
[26:35.020 --> 26:36.020]  Oh, my God.
[26:36.140 --> 26:38.480]  I shot gas all over myself.
[26:39.120 --> 26:40.660]  I tried to put it back together.
[26:41.120 --> 26:44.600]  But the pressure from all the gas coming out just shot it back out at me.
[26:44.780 --> 26:48.740]  And then I went inside and I had to stand in line while the lady looked at me.
[26:49.220 --> 26:50.300]  Stinking of gas.
[26:50.380 --> 26:52.460]  And then she said, she didn't even say anything to me.
[26:52.480 --> 26:54.040]  I said, Um, I made a mistake.
[26:54.380 --> 27:00.200]  And she just pointed to a little dude who had a bucket, like a trash can full of cat litter.
[27:00.200 --> 27:02.800]  And he just like shrugged for me to follow him.
[27:02.820 --> 27:05.740]  And he just walked up and he threw some cat litter down.
[27:06.040 --> 27:09.120]  And he stuck it back in and twisted it.
[27:09.300 --> 27:10.760]  And then it reconnected.
[27:10.760 --> 27:12.200]  And he said, Okay, you're good.
[27:12.860 --> 27:14.420]  And I went, This happens a lot, huh?
[27:14.440 --> 27:15.400]  And he said, No.
[27:15.400 --> 27:17.000]  And then that's it.
[27:21.030 --> 27:21.970]  That's so good.
[27:22.530 --> 27:25.390]  I want to give you the benefit of the doubt.
[27:25.510 --> 27:27.030]  Because this can happen to anyone.
[27:27.290 --> 27:28.230]  It does happen.
[27:28.470 --> 27:28.970]  It sucks.
[27:29.090 --> 27:29.710]  It does happen.
[27:30.030 --> 27:30.670]  And that's okay.
[27:31.190 --> 27:33.650]  Geoff, you're parked at the gas pump.
[27:34.550 --> 27:37.810]  Like, you're like, Oh yeah, this took a long time for us to get Slurpees.
[27:38.330 --> 27:39.450]  I'll go one further.
[27:41.850 --> 27:44.150]  I didn't do it at the same gas station.
[27:44.890 --> 27:46.130]  But I was next door.
[27:46.590 --> 27:48.970]  To the same gas station I did it at last time.
[27:49.110 --> 27:51.750]  Like, the gas stations share a parking lot in an L.
[27:51.850 --> 27:54.010]  I've got to ask, what's changed?
[27:54.550 --> 27:55.610]  It's not a new car?
[27:55.770 --> 27:57.230]  No, here's what I think it is.
[27:57.270 --> 28:00.150]  Because there was a lot of discussion dissecting it for the rest of the day.
[28:03.830 --> 28:14.730]  The prevailing idea is that I have been so stressed out by Rooster Teeth closing and starting up regulation.
[28:14.730 --> 28:16.790]  And my daughter graduating high school.
[28:17.030 --> 28:18.750]  And my daughter going off to college.
[28:19.050 --> 28:23.870]  And the other thing that has been going on behind the scenes that we haven't ever talked about yet.
[28:23.970 --> 28:26.610]  Which is that I moved in the process of this.
[28:26.870 --> 28:28.690]  I didn't want to talk about it until my house sold.
[28:29.190 --> 28:30.410]  Because I don't want to jinx myself.
[28:30.690 --> 28:34.850]  But the day after I found out Rooster Teeth was closing, I put my house on the market.
[28:35.150 --> 28:36.130]  Not in a desperation move.
[28:36.170 --> 28:38.370]  I explained it all in Soul Alright this week.
[28:38.430 --> 28:42.070]  It was a very tactical and smart move to try to create some flexibility in my life.
[28:42.070 --> 28:45.650]  If we found a house in Michigan, someday we could find it.
[28:46.730 --> 28:52.750]  So in the process of Rooster Teeth closing down and us starting all this, I was showing my house off to people.
[28:53.010 --> 28:56.310]  And living in a model home and throwing away half of everything I have.
[28:56.810 --> 28:58.690]  And then trying to find a new home.
[28:58.870 --> 29:04.390]  And then the day that we were set to sign the lease on the new home, we lost it to somebody else.
[29:04.610 --> 29:07.230]  And then so there was a period where we didn't have a place to live.
[29:07.270 --> 29:08.510]  And we had to find a place to live.
[29:08.570 --> 29:09.190]  And then we did.
[29:09.270 --> 29:10.070]  And then we had to move.
[29:10.150 --> 29:11.170]  And that was excruciating.
[29:11.170 --> 29:12.530]  And I'm still dealing with selling the house.
[29:12.590 --> 29:15.750]  And it's just been so much going on in my head.
[29:15.870 --> 29:20.450]  I think I'm just over... I think I'm just overtaxed.
[29:20.610 --> 29:21.090]  Mentally.
[29:22.110 --> 29:22.810]  I think.
[29:23.350 --> 29:25.430]  Or I'm losing my fucking mind.
[29:25.830 --> 29:26.650]  That's the other possibility.
[29:26.670 --> 29:30.090]  I think that completely explains the first instance of this occurring.
[29:30.250 --> 29:31.450]  Like I fully agree with that one.
[29:31.830 --> 29:35.550]  I think this was just a simple case of slurpy enthusiasm.
[29:35.650 --> 29:37.750]  I'm not done with all this stuff though.
[29:38.310 --> 29:42.910]  We were leaving the other house after getting the air conditioner fixed.
[29:43.090 --> 29:47.430]  Because in the process of selling my other house while it's under contract, the fucking AC went out.
[29:47.510 --> 29:49.310]  And I had to go over and spend 48 hours getting it fixed.
[29:49.590 --> 29:51.230]  So it's like I'm still dealing with that stuff.
[29:51.330 --> 29:55.170]  I think I'm just... but I was also having a fun conversation with Emily and Millie and they forgot.
[29:55.590 --> 29:55.930]  Yeah.
[29:56.090 --> 30:01.690]  How is it 2024 and there's no like buzzer when your car is penetrated?
[30:03.290 --> 30:04.330]  That's a good question.
[30:04.450 --> 30:05.270]  I don't know.
[30:05.670 --> 30:06.110]  I don't know.
[30:06.110 --> 30:08.510]  Millie shouldn't be able to drive away with that in at this point.
[30:08.530 --> 30:14.250]  I just... I'm gonna never... I've never done it in my life and then suddenly I've done it twice in the span of about three weeks.
[30:14.630 --> 30:16.310]  How many times do you think you'll do it?
[30:17.310 --> 30:19.750]  I hope never again. Never fucking again.
[30:19.830 --> 30:21.790]  So that's one embarrassing thing I did.
[30:21.870 --> 30:24.010]  I will say, by the way, something we wanted to talk about.
[30:25.010 --> 30:32.410]  Way back in the day when I got... some people thought inordinately annoyed with Andrew for sending a thousand clocks to my house.
[30:32.410 --> 30:36.390]  The day they were supposed to arrive was the day my house went on sale.
[30:37.930 --> 30:45.290]  I had an open house that day at like 11 a.m. and they were supposed to show up in the driveway, a pallet full of clock.
[30:45.710 --> 30:47.310]  That's why I was freaking out.
[30:47.370 --> 30:51.230]  And I was like, please don't send it to my house right now because it was going to ruin my life.
[30:51.710 --> 30:52.690]  Yeah, I started it.
[30:52.830 --> 30:54.550]  First, I wish we had those clocks now.
[30:54.830 --> 30:55.630]  That's the first thing I'll say.
[30:55.870 --> 30:59.530]  Second thing I'll say is that I didn't know that you were doing that.
[30:59.530 --> 31:03.710]  I learned in the act of that conversation that you were moving.
[31:04.550 --> 31:06.010]  Or else I wouldn't have considered it.
[31:06.130 --> 31:08.490]  But the missiles had already been, I think, sent.
[31:08.890 --> 31:10.370]  Yeah, the missiles were already fired.
[31:10.970 --> 31:11.750]  Yeah, but it was fine.
[31:12.210 --> 31:14.070]  A crisis was averted. It was all good.
[31:14.310 --> 31:18.450]  It was just very, very, very funny timing.
[31:18.630 --> 31:22.430]  That's why in the episode you can hear Gavin go, Andrew, you know why he can't have them right now?
[31:24.010 --> 31:25.970]  I should have sent them to Gavin. That's what I should have done.
[31:26.330 --> 31:28.610]  I should have never put you in line of fire.
[31:28.610 --> 31:31.430]  No, no, no, it's fine. I love being in the line of fire.
[31:31.530 --> 31:34.870]  It was just the fucking perfect timing, that's all.
[31:34.990 --> 31:42.690]  I think we need to create something or you need to establish a rule that you are not allowed to leave until your car is filled.
[31:43.650 --> 31:44.830]  Because I think that's the problem.
[31:44.930 --> 31:49.490]  If you just stayed there through the whole act, then you're freed up.
[31:49.710 --> 31:53.730]  Oh, I see. I see. I can't walk away from the pump until it's returned.
[31:54.130 --> 31:57.030]  Yeah, you know what? That's a good... I'll take that. I'll take that note.
[31:57.030 --> 32:03.330]  There needs to be like, you made the wrist pocket like a gas pocket where like you have to cuff yourself to the thing.
[32:03.690 --> 32:07.170]  So if you physically leave, it's getting pulled out with you at least.
[32:07.250 --> 32:09.570]  I'm going to endeavor just not to physically leave.
[32:09.690 --> 32:13.610]  But if I can't adhere to that, then I'll invent something.
[32:13.710 --> 32:15.930]  But I think you're right. I think that's the solution.
[32:16.090 --> 32:20.370]  I shouldn't trust myself to walk inside of a gas station while it's still pumping outside.
[32:20.570 --> 32:24.650]  Because something, there's a breakdown in communication in my brain that happens on the way out.
[32:24.650 --> 32:26.110]  And it's, yeah.
[32:27.350 --> 32:31.950]  I view it as like a Borderlands game and I'm just making the numbers go up.
[32:32.110 --> 32:35.550]  And then I realize I have to pay what that number is and the game becomes a lot less fun.
[32:36.130 --> 32:38.390]  But watching the numbers go up is always good.
[32:38.870 --> 32:44.270]  I'm imagining it like every time you enter or exit a building, it's like memento and you don't know what's just happened.
[32:44.730 --> 32:47.470]  It's like, am I chasing this guy or is he chasing me?
[32:47.570 --> 32:48.510]  Kind of, yeah.
[32:48.850 --> 32:49.710]  What was I doing?
[32:50.030 --> 32:51.170]  I'm a bit of a Guy Pearce.
[32:51.410 --> 32:52.470]  Better drive off.
[32:53.130 --> 33:02.110]  The other embarrassing thing I did to myself, I actually did last week and I fucked it up in the episode when we were recording Regulation.
[33:02.650 --> 33:10.710]  Right before we recorded last week, I went through, I had some spare time and I've been, I've just been having like fun making thumbnails lately.
[33:10.810 --> 33:14.650]  It's just been really kind of rewarding and insane for me.
[33:15.050 --> 33:15.870]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[33:15.970 --> 33:17.370]  But I've just, I've really been embracing it.
[33:17.370 --> 33:22.110]  And I always enjoyed it when we were doing Fuck Face as well, but it was always like a last minute thing.
[33:22.550 --> 33:27.490]  And so when we found out we were shutting down, we didn't make thumbnails for the last like 12 episodes.
[33:27.750 --> 33:28.310]  Didn't see the point.
[33:28.870 --> 33:30.970]  And it's been bugging me on YouTube.
[33:31.630 --> 33:35.950]  Anytime I go to our channel and I see all those last few episodes with no thumbs.
[33:36.070 --> 33:38.350]  So I went back the other day, like last Wednesday or something.
[33:38.350 --> 33:47.110]  And I just created thumbnails for the final like three months of Fuck Face episodes and put them all up just so it looks intentional.
[33:47.190 --> 33:48.470]  It looks like it's supposed to, right?
[33:48.850 --> 33:52.090]  And after that, I was kind of bummed because I was like on such a roll.
[33:52.270 --> 33:55.310]  I was like, man, I wish I could record the next episode of Regulation.
[33:55.470 --> 34:01.030]  I wish I could do the next episode of Regulations thumbnail now, but I can't because we haven't recorded the episode yet.
[34:01.090 --> 34:01.710]  That's impossible.
[34:02.230 --> 34:03.470]  And I thought, is it?
[34:03.930 --> 34:04.770]  Is it impossible?
[34:05.190 --> 34:08.950]  Like, what if I just figured out what we're going to talk about?
[34:09.570 --> 34:14.050]  And then I just try to create a thumbnail based around that.
[34:14.150 --> 34:18.730]  And then I thought, well, that's too hard to nail because we go in so many different directions.
[34:18.730 --> 34:20.790]  But what I can control is what I talk about.
[34:21.090 --> 34:25.030]  So I was like, why don't I just come up with something to talk about that's thumbnail worthy?
[34:25.170 --> 34:27.510]  And then I can make the thumbnail now.
[34:28.210 --> 34:33.030]  And then in the episode when it's over, I can be like, oh, by the way, I already have the thumbnail for this.
[34:33.030 --> 34:36.070]  And if I'm going to do this, I should record the whole process.
[34:36.210 --> 34:44.610]  And I'll make a piece of supplemental content where I'm coming up with a subject to talk about, then creating the thumbnail for it.
[34:44.670 --> 34:52.050]  And then giving myself the goal of in the episode naturally bringing this subject up so that then I can transition into it.
[34:52.090 --> 34:53.030]  And then the thumbnail is done.
[34:53.050 --> 34:57.130]  And then I can talk about it at the end of the episode or never talk about it and just release the supplemental content.
[34:57.250 --> 34:57.390]  Right?
[34:58.630 --> 35:00.950]  So I was like, well, what am I going to fucking talk about?
[35:00.950 --> 35:03.170]  So I thought, here's what I'll do.
[35:03.290 --> 35:07.890]  I'll go to random.org and I'll put in all the subjects from Trivial Pursuit.
[35:08.330 --> 35:09.970]  The main five subjects from Trivial Pursuit.
[35:10.170 --> 35:13.810]  And then I'll randomize it and whatever comes up with, then I'll do research on that topic.
[35:13.990 --> 35:17.190]  So here I am hoping I get like entertainment or sports or something, right?
[35:17.790 --> 35:19.150]  And I get fucking...
[35:19.150 --> 35:19.550]  I'm so confused.
[35:20.730 --> 35:22.910]  Why wouldn't you just make a thumbnail about a gas pump?
[35:23.790 --> 35:24.630]  Well, that hadn't happened yet.
[35:25.770 --> 35:29.370]  No, but I also feel like it's bound to happen.
[35:30.250 --> 35:31.750]  That's what I thought you were going to get, Gavin.
[35:31.810 --> 35:32.770]  It's going to happen again.
[35:32.830 --> 35:33.970]  Just get that gas pump ready.
[35:36.070 --> 35:38.050]  The gas pump thing happened yesterday, dude.
[35:38.110 --> 35:39.290]  This is last week.
[35:40.770 --> 35:42.650]  It was less than 24 hours ago.
[35:42.690 --> 35:43.470]  The gas pump thing happened.
[35:44.210 --> 35:46.250]  So anyway, I start doing research.
[35:46.450 --> 35:48.370]  I landed on science, unfortunately.
[35:48.670 --> 35:50.870]  So I was like, oh, I got to come up with a funny science thumbnail.
[35:51.070 --> 35:55.270]  So I started doing research on the wildest things to happen in science in 2024.
[35:55.270 --> 36:13.230]  And the best I could come up with is that they just are about to release 4 billion mosquitoes into the wild that are genetically altered so that any lady mosquitoes they have sex with, they make eggs, but the eggs don't ever hatch.
[36:13.390 --> 36:15.270]  And it's supposed to kill out all the mosquitoes, right?
[36:15.770 --> 36:17.170]  Or control the population.
[36:17.710 --> 36:18.250]  The genophage.
[36:18.710 --> 36:19.010]  Yeah.
[36:19.170 --> 36:20.550]  And I thought, like, that's kind of funny.
[36:21.010 --> 36:32.130]  Maybe I could talk about how unintended consequences, like, they release 4 billion mosquitoes out that when they have sex, they basically create... they ruin society.
[36:32.250 --> 36:34.870]  And I was like, you know, what if it transfers to humans?
[36:35.150 --> 36:35.450]  Eat all the crops.
[36:35.630 --> 36:38.330]  A bunch of dudes that every time they fuck, now nobody else can have kids.
[36:39.050 --> 36:44.230]  Or I thought, like, maybe I could go this way and think about, like, is it enough to just make the mosquitoes?
[36:44.750 --> 36:46.050]  Should they also be hot?
[36:46.050 --> 36:51.770]  Like, did they have to make hot, like, George Clooney mosquitoes that all the lady mosquitoes would be into, right?
[36:51.790 --> 36:53.390]  And then they would want to bang these dudes.
[36:54.010 --> 36:54.250]  Mosquitoes?
[36:54.450 --> 36:55.810]  I don't know why I keep saying it like that.
[36:56.350 --> 36:58.290]  So anyway, I was like, that's funny.
[36:58.510 --> 36:59.990]  I can work that out.
[37:00.070 --> 37:04.390]  And so I'm recording all this live, going through the random.org, figuring it all out.
[37:04.430 --> 37:05.610]  It's like a 20-minute video.
[37:05.930 --> 37:10.790]  I make the thumbnail for episode 4, which is like a mosquito with a knife and a fork.
[37:10.890 --> 37:11.570]  And I'm like, perfect.
[37:11.690 --> 37:13.390]  Now all I got to do is talk about it in the episode.
[37:13.390 --> 37:19.950]  And then after we recorded the episode, I was eating dinner and I thought, oh shit, I never talked about it.
[37:20.010 --> 37:22.790]  That is totally fucking wasted now.
[37:22.990 --> 37:26.850]  There's no point in ever releasing any of this content.
[37:27.010 --> 37:32.510]  So I made a whole fucking supplemental thing and then just completely slipped my mind when we were recording last week.
[37:32.810 --> 37:34.750]  And I just forgot about it.
[37:35.350 --> 37:36.750]  You do realize we do this every week.
[37:37.210 --> 37:38.990]  Yeah, but it's not the same thing.
[37:39.110 --> 37:39.910]  It's not the same.
[37:39.970 --> 37:40.570]  It's not the same.
[37:40.630 --> 37:41.110]  It's ruined.
[37:41.230 --> 37:41.650]  It's ruined.
[37:41.650 --> 37:41.730]  It's ruined.
[37:41.770 --> 37:42.290]  I would know.
[37:42.450 --> 37:42.930]  It's fine.
[37:44.270 --> 37:45.170]  But we wouldn't.
[37:45.290 --> 37:46.910]  I feel like the point is we don't know.
[37:47.850 --> 37:50.170]  I don't see how it would have been any different if you had done it this week.
[37:50.270 --> 37:50.710]  I wouldn't have known.
[37:50.710 --> 37:51.170]  I wouldn't have known.
[37:51.490 --> 37:52.550]  I would have known.
[37:53.170 --> 37:54.950]  But you would always have known.
[37:55.110 --> 37:56.290]  You knew anyway.
[37:56.610 --> 37:57.710]  You always know.
[37:58.210 --> 38:02.590]  Yeah, but if I hadn't fucked it up, I could be excited about it and proud of it and be like, yeah, here's an idea.
[38:02.790 --> 38:03.910]  But I fucked it up.
[38:03.990 --> 38:05.470]  And so now I just like, I can't even muster.
[38:05.470 --> 38:06.850]  I can't lie to you guys.
[38:06.950 --> 38:08.810]  I can't like try to pull it off.
[38:09.490 --> 38:10.770]  I'm too honest with you.
[38:11.310 --> 38:13.990]  It's probably funnier that I botched it.
[38:14.190 --> 38:20.850]  You know, that I fucking put my foot in my own asshole instead of just releasing a piece of content that I...
[38:20.850 --> 38:23.010]  Can we please release the supplemental anyway?
[38:23.290 --> 38:25.670]  Because I feel like you're probably really excited about it.
[38:25.910 --> 38:29.190]  Oh yeah, I'm so into my idea and I think it's so clever.
[38:29.210 --> 38:32.610]  So we are going to release the Mosquitio content or not?
[38:33.330 --> 38:34.710]  I think we have to.
[38:34.750 --> 38:35.250]  I recorded it.
[38:35.250 --> 38:35.750]  I think we must.
[38:37.670 --> 38:38.610]  I don't know when.
[38:38.770 --> 38:40.530]  Yeah, we should do that relatively soon.
[38:41.050 --> 38:43.410]  Is it like you blindsided yourself?
[38:43.810 --> 38:44.250]  Kind of.
[38:44.410 --> 38:45.070]  It sounds like it.
[38:45.190 --> 38:47.550]  Kind of, exactly like I blindsided myself, yeah.
[38:49.050 --> 38:51.690]  It's like those Mosquitios are going to get blindsided when the kids are left.
[38:51.690 --> 38:57.670]  I was so fucking excited to do this.
[38:57.670 --> 38:58.710]  Talk about the Mosquitios.
[38:58.990 --> 38:59.350]  Yeah.
[39:01.690 --> 39:02.850]  Yeah, I really was.
[39:03.130 --> 39:06.010]  I thought you were just going to drop this week's thumbnail into the Discord.
[39:06.130 --> 39:06.850]  Yeah, I thought.
[39:07.850 --> 39:10.030]  100%, yeah, I thought it was about to happen and we were all going to go,
[39:10.030 --> 39:10.210]  Whoa!
[39:10.210 --> 39:10.750]  I'm excited.
[39:11.510 --> 39:12.450]  I'm looking for it.
[39:12.530 --> 39:14.110]  I can't find it.
[39:15.070 --> 39:15.910]  Oh, no.
[39:16.790 --> 39:18.470]  No, he can't even find it.
[39:18.490 --> 39:20.470]  It's not like a great thumbnail.
[39:20.610 --> 39:23.310]  Could the Mosquitio thumbnail be this week's thumbnail?
[39:23.970 --> 39:26.850]  I mean, now I guess it could, but it'd be better if it was.
[39:26.850 --> 39:27.650]  It sounds like you don't want it.
[39:27.650 --> 39:29.110]  Yeah, but it sounds like you don't want it to be.
[39:29.330 --> 39:30.910]  Probably funnier if it was the gas pump.
[39:31.010 --> 39:34.870]  I like the idea of the thumbnail for this being a subject we didn't talk about.
[39:34.870 --> 39:39.710]  The thumbnail for this being, uh, that says Episode 4 when it's Episode 5, too.
[39:40.790 --> 39:40.930]  Oh.
[39:43.030 --> 39:44.070]  Well, I can't find it.
[39:44.170 --> 39:45.590]  It's in my Photoshop file.
[39:46.230 --> 39:47.330]  Anyway, that's how I'm dumb.
[39:47.710 --> 39:48.950]  I'm dumb in those two ways.
[39:49.050 --> 39:52.970]  I'm surprised that you didn't just bank a story that you were happy with.
[39:53.210 --> 39:55.750]  I love that you pursued it the way you did.
[39:56.210 --> 39:57.970]  It's just such an interesting approach.
[39:58.170 --> 40:03.090]  The exploration of the idea was the interesting part to me.
[40:03.090 --> 40:07.050]  Not creating a thumbnail ahead of time to save time.
[40:07.330 --> 40:10.470]  Like, it was more of like, it would be funny if I could make this happen.
[40:11.370 --> 40:12.930]  And then I thought it was a clever idea.
[40:13.090 --> 40:17.210]  And then I couldn't make it happen because I'm stupid and I'm my own worst enemy.
[40:17.490 --> 40:19.190]  And then, like, that's kind of par for the course.
[40:19.390 --> 40:25.410]  And so instead of trying to re-kajigger it in the future to make it work in some way, I'd rather just be honest and be like,
[40:25.410 --> 40:27.670]  Hey, look at this. Look how fucking stupid Geoff is.
[40:28.030 --> 40:32.270]  Thought he was smart for about seven minutes, but it turns out he's dumber than ever.
[40:32.630 --> 40:33.910]  You know, that kind of thing.
[40:33.990 --> 40:41.930]  See, to me, the intense, scary moment of the bit that you're saying is the story not landing as hoped.
[40:42.450 --> 40:46.210]  Like, if it just doesn't deliver the way that you thought it would, that would be my concern.
[40:46.710 --> 40:50.390]  More so than, like, the discovery of it and the searchability.
[40:51.450 --> 40:57.310]  You are really putting your flag down that this is going to be a memorable part of this episode.
[40:57.750 --> 41:00.350]  If it doesn't land, it just doesn't work.
[41:00.810 --> 41:06.810]  Now, see, that's not a problem for me because I have enough of an ego that I'm confident in my ability to land the story.
[41:10.110 --> 41:12.030]  Unless it's about a horse.
[41:12.030 --> 41:17.130]  Right, I may not land the story. Like, they don't all land. I definitely botched the horse down the mountain.
[41:17.430 --> 41:19.850]  But I had confidence going in that I would do it.
[41:22.190 --> 41:28.630]  I'm like an 85-90% free throw shooter. Chances are I'm going to hit the free throw.
[41:30.750 --> 41:41.150]  Part of this show is you just talking about, like, you're just burying yourself with things that I haven't thought about in years or never would have known at all.
[41:41.150 --> 41:49.690]  The thing I like about Geoff's confidence is I feel like a lot of the times the miss isn't as present to us as it is you.
[41:50.290 --> 41:52.910]  The Horse Hill story we were totally happy with.
[41:53.490 --> 42:00.290]  Yeah, no, no, no, I'm my own worst enemy, but I do feel like most of the time my misplaced confidence works out.
[42:00.450 --> 42:06.130]  Like, remember when I hit all the home runs? Nobody thought I would do that, but then I just believed in myself and then it worked.
[42:06.130 --> 42:14.130]  So I just tend to believe in myself. I just shouldn't always and I recognize that, but it's easier to believe in yourself than not believe in yourself.
[42:16.390 --> 42:22.050]  I hadn't hit a baseball in 20 years when we fucking did that day. I just assumed it would work and it did.
[42:22.850 --> 42:26.090]  I wonder, did you play a lot of baseball growing up?
[42:26.850 --> 42:30.210]  Like backyard baseball every day, but never like on a team or anything.
[42:30.210 --> 42:44.430]  OK, never mind then. I was going to say, I wonder, like in your overall all time life hitting ball stats, how much like if you looked at it on a chart, just did you did you hit more in that time period than you had as a kid?
[42:44.850 --> 42:50.270]  No, no, but I hit it, but it was a lot. It was a consolidated amount of hits.
[42:50.890 --> 42:56.210]  Let me tell you guys about a good idea I had, though, that is a good idea, I think, that I won't fuck up.
[42:56.210 --> 43:04.610]  All right. Last night I was doing that thing where I was in going through my pantry and I was looking for something to eat, a snack.
[43:04.830 --> 43:10.270]  And, you know, like summer after summer, like after eight p.m., everything in your house looks like dog shit.
[43:10.450 --> 43:13.670]  Even if you were really excited about it at like six p.m. when you bought it.
[43:14.330 --> 43:18.650]  But like for like eight p.m. to whenever you go to bed, you're like suddenly you're like, I don't want this.
[43:18.770 --> 43:22.310]  Why the fuck do I have this? There's nothing in my house to eat. I don't like anything. Right.
[43:23.790 --> 43:26.070]  And it's only because it's your shit. Right.
[43:26.930 --> 43:30.870]  What if you were able to flag something on an app that said, like, I'm available.
[43:30.890 --> 43:34.530]  And then like whenever you get up for a snack, like let's say it's nine p.m.
[43:34.530 --> 43:38.470]  You go to your pantry in your fridge. Nothing looks good. You toggle your app.
[43:38.510 --> 43:42.410]  It says I'm available. You get a ding. Somebody else toggled their app.
[43:42.530 --> 43:48.850]  It then says, hey, for the next 30 minutes, you and this stranger can can switch kitchens.
[43:48.850 --> 43:53.550]  And then you drive to his house and he drives to your house and you can raid his kitchen for 30 minutes.
[43:53.610 --> 43:57.090]  And he can raid your kitchen for 30 minutes, whatever the fuck you want.
[43:57.190 --> 44:01.490]  And then when the timer's off, you just go home because you do because you want stuff to eat.
[44:01.590 --> 44:04.730]  You just don't want your stuff. But somebody else's stuff is fucking great.
[44:04.850 --> 44:09.510]  And your stuff has value just to everybody but you. So why not?
[44:09.730 --> 44:13.590]  Let's just like do it with our neighbors. Why not just go over to your neighbor's house at 930 tomorrow night,
[44:13.630 --> 44:16.050]  knock on the door and say, go to my house. I'll go. I'm going to hang out in your kitchen.
[44:16.050 --> 44:18.890]  I'll meet you back here in 30 minutes and we'll both be happier.
[44:19.290 --> 44:24.190]  I feel like I wouldn't even necessarily need to raid the other pantries. I just want inspiration sometimes.
[44:24.410 --> 44:28.770]  Yeah, like I just want to look through and just take notes and be like, oh, I want to order some of this.
[44:28.830 --> 44:32.510]  I'm going to go and get some of that. Now, are we talking like you're binge?
[44:32.590 --> 44:36.650]  You have 30 minutes or whatever, and you can consume as much as you want.
[44:37.410 --> 44:42.550]  I mean, you're not you're not trying to I assume you're not trying to like.
[44:43.610 --> 44:48.830]  Take advantage of somebody's kitchen. I think you just like you just really want a snack.
[44:49.130 --> 44:59.730]  But all you have are like, I don't know, goldfish crackers and pretzel sticks and some string cheese.
[44:59.810 --> 45:05.170]  And that's you don't want any of those things. But your neighbor might have some peanut butter crackers.
[45:05.170 --> 45:07.510]  They're like, oh, I wish I had those. So now you can't.
[45:07.550 --> 45:14.630]  My my brain immediately goes to Survivor when they sometimes have these challenges where if you win,
[45:14.730 --> 45:19.430]  you get to go to the other tribe's beach and steal one of their items.
[45:19.730 --> 45:24.630]  But you tell them what you're taking. And it's like a thing where they're like, I hope they don't take this.
[45:24.930 --> 45:33.030]  The idea of like you get to go to your neighbor's house and have to decide, are you going to eat the steak that they just made and leave them with like nothing?
[45:33.030 --> 45:37.570]  I think it's so funny. The idea to be fair, your neighbor toggled that it was available.
[45:37.750 --> 45:40.550]  Yeah, they don't want to share that steak. They shouldn't hit that on the app.
[45:41.490 --> 45:45.610]  That's it would always be a consensual steak. The doors are open on both sides.
[45:45.750 --> 45:51.170]  It's not it's not a thing where like you get one toggle a year and you get to decide when that is.
[45:51.230 --> 45:56.370]  And the other person who's opted in as well doesn't get to choose when that one it happens.
[45:56.910 --> 46:02.410]  No, I don't think so. I think it's just like you just flag yourself as available for anybody that's looking to snack swap.
[46:02.410 --> 46:05.770]  I think it would make streets less wasteful too.
[46:06.210 --> 46:09.890]  I agree. I totally agree. More stuff would get eaten.
[46:09.890 --> 46:13.310]  I like this idea. Yeah. Snack swap.
[46:13.510 --> 46:15.030]  What if we all just did it with each other?
[46:16.810 --> 46:20.690]  We would just be hanging out all the time. Which I'm totally okay with.
[46:21.510 --> 46:27.490]  We should just put all our names in a bowl and then you pick out whose pantry you're going for. And then we'll just take it evening.
[46:28.990 --> 46:32.370]  Why can't I find this stupid mosquito?
[46:34.570 --> 46:40.190]  Your idea, Geoff, is sort of similar to an idea I had that I don't know how to make work.
[46:40.930 --> 46:46.790]  But the best naps are always naps when you've agreed to do something, but you just don't feel like it.
[46:47.090 --> 46:51.270]  You're obligated to go do this thing, but you're comfy and you can have a nap.
[46:51.390 --> 46:53.610]  Oh man, I would so love to have a nap right now.
[46:53.610 --> 47:01.870]  If there was a way to convince yourself that you could sleep through one of those instances without any consequences,
[47:02.070 --> 47:08.210]  and that it was actually all okay, that this isn't real but you think it is, I would pay so much for that.
[47:08.690 --> 47:13.150]  Like a fake meeting type thing that I'm skipping by having this nap.
[47:13.850 --> 47:15.450]  I don't know what you just said.
[47:16.910 --> 47:21.850]  Have you ever... okay, let me translate.
[47:22.390 --> 47:28.730]  Have you ever laid in bed and you see the cheese coming down the hill?
[47:29.950 --> 47:31.590]  He's doing a round of accents today.
[47:31.930 --> 47:34.470]  Does everyone else here know what Andrew just said?
[47:34.690 --> 47:34.890]  No.
[47:36.150 --> 47:36.890]  That's a no from me.
[47:37.150 --> 47:43.510]  I have no idea. I do not understand. I figured it was just, okay, Geoff found the stupid thumbnail.
[47:43.510 --> 47:45.910]  That's a good thumbnail. I like that thumbnail.
[47:46.670 --> 47:48.850]  It's just a cute little mosquito.
[47:50.870 --> 48:02.630]  Let's say it is 1pm. It's 1pm and you agreed previously that you were going to go do something at 2pm.
[48:03.030 --> 48:09.070]  And you're relaxed, you're laying down, you're cozy, and it's like, oh man, you know what?
[48:09.070 --> 48:15.430]  I made this obligation beforehand, but in a world in which I had no plans, a nap would be so good right now.
[48:15.770 --> 48:16.630]  This would be so great.
[48:17.270 --> 48:24.870]  I feel like the best naps are always in those instances where you can't nap because you have an obligation you need to fulfill.
[48:25.330 --> 48:27.470]  So you can't do it. So you have to go to the thing.
[48:27.750 --> 48:29.310]  Like a pre-commitment nap.
[48:29.870 --> 48:30.850]  Pre-commitment nap.
[48:30.850 --> 48:43.130]  I want a service that makes me believe that I have one of those, that I can sleep through, but there's no actual consequence.
[48:43.530 --> 48:46.290]  How would this service manifest itself?
[48:46.890 --> 48:49.050]  That is the problem that I've had.
[48:49.370 --> 48:50.710]  You just want a feeling.
[48:51.530 --> 49:00.790]  Well, I want something to feed me fake meetings, but the issue is I know they're fake.
[49:00.870 --> 49:03.190]  I need to somehow not know that these are fake meetings.
[49:03.190 --> 49:10.970]  I mean, if you want, we could just go about our lives the next month, and one of the things I put in your calendar will be fake.
[49:11.430 --> 49:14.950]  No, because I won't know which one it is, and that will just make me more anxious.
[49:15.270 --> 49:16.130]  Like, that's the problem.
[49:16.730 --> 49:18.710]  I need to somehow...
[49:18.710 --> 49:20.670]  So you need to know...
[49:20.670 --> 49:22.610]  I need to feel it's real.
[49:23.830 --> 49:24.970]  For the nap.
[49:26.130 --> 49:26.690]  But...
[49:26.690 --> 49:28.490]  Because I don't want to miss the meeting.
[49:28.810 --> 49:30.710]  I want to spend time with you.
[49:31.930 --> 49:33.170]  That would take priority.
[49:34.310 --> 49:34.870]  But...
[49:34.870 --> 49:38.610]  A nap is absolutely enhanced by these situations.
[49:39.190 --> 49:40.630]  It is more appealing.
[49:41.050 --> 49:41.810]  At least to me.
[49:42.510 --> 49:43.390]  And that is the problem.
[49:43.390 --> 49:53.190]  There's not a world in which I can both believe I'm actually skipping this meeting, while also knowing that it's fake.
[49:53.770 --> 49:57.830]  I don't get the joy of like, you know what, I actually don't have anything I have to do.
[49:57.950 --> 49:58.670]  I can sleep.
[49:59.290 --> 50:00.330]  Because then I feel bad.
[50:00.390 --> 50:02.130]  Because I'm missing the get-together.
[50:02.370 --> 50:05.650]  So you want it to be fake, but you want to feel like it's real.
[50:05.990 --> 50:06.370]  Yes.
[50:06.650 --> 50:10.730]  I need it to be fake, but I need to simultaneously feel it's real.
[50:10.730 --> 50:16.650]  I think it would be funnier just to sign you up for a bunch of different appointments and consultations.
[50:16.910 --> 50:17.750]  You know what?
[50:18.370 --> 50:20.570]  Geoff, you may have cracked the code.
[50:21.070 --> 50:27.950]  If it's stuff I don't care about, for things that I have zero interest in with people I don't know, that might be the move.
[50:28.210 --> 50:30.630]  But if it's low stakes, why would you even worry about it?
[50:31.090 --> 50:38.450]  Because I feel like if it's you and I are supposed to hang out, and then I slept through it, I'd feel like I'd let you down.
[50:38.450 --> 50:41.930]  Just for how I am. And I'd be like, oh man, I wish I would have been able to hang out with Gavin.
[50:42.370 --> 50:44.230]  Well, just give me a PS5 and it will be forgiven.
[50:46.010 --> 50:47.350]  I'd rather just show up.
[50:48.250 --> 50:49.710]  And that wouldn't solve my guilt.
[50:50.230 --> 50:52.150]  I wouldn't be able to buy my guilt away like that.
[50:52.590 --> 50:54.030]  That's not how my feelings work.
[50:55.110 --> 50:56.490]  I like Geoff's idea a lot.
[50:56.650 --> 51:00.430]  I'm going to sign up for so many things that I'm not going to show up to.
[51:00.430 --> 51:08.270]  We could have a carpet cleaner consultation, window blind...
[51:08.270 --> 51:11.590]  Yeah, you're going to get all the quotes in the world, but never papers.
[51:11.590 --> 51:13.990]  I don't want to waste people's time.
[51:13.990 --> 51:15.390]  Sierra Club...
[51:15.390 --> 51:17.410]  So it has to be like group time.
[51:17.570 --> 51:18.850]  Like a yoga class?
[51:19.310 --> 51:26.650]  I don't understand what is going on for the last... it must be ten minutes of the show.
[51:26.810 --> 51:28.490]  So wait, when he re-explained it...
[51:28.490 --> 51:35.370]  Do you want a feeling that you know is real? A Schrodinger's feeling of real and fake at the same time?
[51:35.570 --> 51:40.050]  Andrew, so you can take what you think is a pretty good nap.
[51:40.550 --> 51:42.490]  Well, it enhances the nap.
[51:43.010 --> 51:44.890]  It's like the sequel to Inception.
[51:45.330 --> 51:47.490]  It's like icy-hotting your nap.
[51:48.110 --> 51:54.550]  Have you never been in that scenario where you're like, man, this would be such a great fucking nap right now, but I can't because I have an obligation.
[51:55.130 --> 51:55.910]  I've never felt that.
[51:55.910 --> 51:57.930]  No. No. Never.
[51:58.350 --> 52:03.070]  In my life. You're describing a feeling that I can't chase because I don't know that it exists.
[52:03.710 --> 52:11.790]  Here's the thing. If we were to also do a poll about that, there are more people that feel that way than didn't know that opera had words.
[52:12.270 --> 52:22.490]  I gotta say, just because the people who listen to this feel that way does not mean I'm listening to them for advice on anything at all.
[52:22.490 --> 52:27.330]  Are you saying that regulation listeners are a poor barometer of the human race?
[52:27.490 --> 52:33.190]  Well, I mean, one of the hosts of this show didn't know what Italian was, so I don't know that I can trust any of these people.
[52:33.990 --> 52:39.250]  I mean, I think the hosts are a poor barometer, so you know what I mean?
[52:39.770 --> 52:41.970]  Yeah, so what's up, Geoff? You gonna take a nap or not?
[52:42.890 --> 52:44.190]  No, I don't want to get in trouble.
[52:46.910 --> 52:53.950]  So after all that, Andrew, what would be a suitable appointment that you could nap before and potentially miss?
[52:54.950 --> 52:56.290]  Uh, I think like...
[52:56.970 --> 53:00.310]  A group activity that you think is real, but no, isn't real.
[53:01.150 --> 53:07.930]  No, it is. Here's the problem is that in all of these contexts, these are people I care about.
[53:09.430 --> 53:13.510]  Well, no, let me explain. I'm trying to explain this thought process.
[53:14.250 --> 53:19.610]  It's always, if I have a meeting or I'm supposed to hang out with someone, I care about them. I don't want to disappoint them.
[53:19.950 --> 53:27.430]  If it is a group of people I don't know or care about, I'm okay disappointing this random group activity.
[53:27.890 --> 53:31.330]  Who don't you like? Well, let's schedule some group activities with people you don't care about.
[53:31.390 --> 53:35.270]  Yeah, let us know. Get us a list of people you hate and we'll put it on the calendar.
[53:37.350 --> 53:41.230]  Yeah. I want to help you out here. I want to help you achieve your ultimate nap.
[53:41.230 --> 53:45.150]  Say you were about to guest on a podcast that you didn't care about.
[53:46.950 --> 53:50.990]  Okay. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to think.
[53:51.910 --> 53:53.630]  Just think of a podcast you don't care about.
[53:55.230 --> 53:59.090]  Well, that's not true because sometimes I care about the people even if I don't care about the show.
[53:59.090 --> 54:00.270]  Yeah, but these are people you don't care about.
[54:01.210 --> 54:05.430]  I don't know anyone who has a podcast.
[54:05.430 --> 54:08.830]  You're going to be disappointing them when you don't show up for bowling or whatever activity it is.
[54:08.830 --> 54:12.210]  You're set to appear on Howard Stern in an hour.
[54:12.530 --> 54:13.790]  No, that would be a problem. No.
[54:15.090 --> 54:16.350]  You wouldn't take a nap?
[54:17.550 --> 54:28.790]  I feel like I'm a guest in that scenario and that there's some expectation where if I sign up for bowling Sundays, nobody's going to care if I don't show up.
[54:28.870 --> 54:30.570]  I don't know any of these people. These people don't know me.
[54:30.890 --> 54:32.550]  You don't think they miss you from the bowling team?
[54:32.910 --> 54:34.790]  No, because I've never been there.
[54:34.790 --> 54:44.930]  I think that's what I need to do is start signing up for group activities that don't matter, that will continue and happily exist regardless of my presence.
[54:44.930 --> 54:47.010]  And to them, there's not even a face to the name.
[54:47.330 --> 54:50.670]  There's not even a face to the name. It's not like I'm failing on them.
[54:51.190 --> 54:51.730]  I got it.
[54:53.250 --> 54:59.670]  You need to go down to your local library or your local bookstore and you need to join a book club.
[54:59.670 --> 55:05.950]  Oh, that's the move, Geoff. I should have consulted with you earlier.
[55:06.210 --> 55:15.150]  You need to join a book club that meets every Tuesday at 6pm or 8pm or whatever and then you plan your naps right before that.
[55:15.770 --> 55:22.810]  What if you signed up online for one of those seminars at the Apple store? You could learn Final Cut.
[55:24.310 --> 55:34.670]  Here's the thing I like about signing up for the book club is I can get multiple. It's not even just I'm missing the meeting. I could be in bed and be like, oh, I'm supposed to read this book.
[55:35.890 --> 55:41.870]  You can procrastinate. You've got a week of procrastination. You can dole out whatever you feel like.
[55:42.150 --> 55:46.110]  Oh, this is good. I'm going to Google one right now. Book clubs.
[55:47.550 --> 55:51.130]  I don't even need them to be my area. I'm not showing up. It doesn't fucking matter.
[55:51.130 --> 56:00.670]  This is so stupid because you know so much. If it's not even in your area, you would never even intend to go. It's so pointless. I don't understand this. I'm back with Eric.
[56:01.650 --> 56:06.630]  I mean, I should be in your area. There needs to be local stakes.
[56:08.190 --> 56:13.110]  June book club meeting, three spots left. I'm signing up right now. There you go, you're set.
[56:14.390 --> 56:17.730]  Dude, you're going to sleep like a baby.
[56:17.730 --> 56:21.890]  No, he's going to feel so guilty that you're going to end up reading the damn book and go it.
[56:21.930 --> 56:23.310]  Oh, one hundred percent. One hundred percent.
[56:24.870 --> 56:30.410]  I don't think I'm actually allowed to go to this book club, so I got to pick a different one.
[56:30.510 --> 56:33.030]  Why not? Are you banned from that one?
[56:34.510 --> 56:38.610]  It's named gender specifically in a way that does not fit me.
[56:40.010 --> 56:43.730]  Is it an Italian book club? Because you are no longer...
[56:43.730 --> 56:49.590]  No, I love Italy. I'm a big chicken parmesan, probably my favorite food.
[56:50.830 --> 56:54.210]  Did you once go in there and say that you can't read books and then you had to leave?
[56:56.750 --> 56:58.030]  No, I can read.
[57:01.930 --> 57:05.530]  Throw some words at me right now, fucking proof it. Whatever you want.
[57:07.310 --> 57:09.350]  You want me to say a word and see if you read it?
[57:10.670 --> 57:13.370]  Put it in the chat. Read that shit all day.
[57:15.790 --> 57:16.190]  Mosquititos.
[57:17.570 --> 57:21.570]  Damn it, I was copying and pasting that right now.
[57:21.690 --> 57:22.990]  You fucking got me, god damn it.
[57:26.910 --> 57:27.670]  Fucking hell.
[57:28.310 --> 57:34.690]  You know the little apple pies, the little hot apple pies you get at fast food restaurants?
[57:34.850 --> 57:35.130]  Hell yeah.
[57:36.130 --> 57:40.290]  Like at McDonald's or Top Notch has them, they're fucking great.
[57:40.770 --> 57:43.150]  What do you call those? Are they called hand pies?
[57:43.270 --> 57:44.370]  I think so.
[57:45.130 --> 57:50.350]  Like when I was a kid, Dolly Madison made them and they had the Peanuts characters on them.
[57:50.790 --> 57:53.990]  You know what I mean? Like you get a little cherry pie and it had Charlie Brown on it or Lucy or whatever.
[57:54.430 --> 57:59.230]  I mean I know what you're talking about but then you started talking about Snoopy on it or whatever and I don't know what you're talking about anymore.
[57:59.610 --> 58:02.030]  Oh, you don't know those? It might be before your time, hold on.
[58:03.390 --> 58:04.450]  Snoopy hand pies?
[58:06.610 --> 58:09.550]  There you go. It was my whole childhood.
[58:10.790 --> 58:11.690]  Snack pies?
[58:13.230 --> 58:17.050]  I know the pies, I know what you're talking about, I've just never seen them with Snoopy guys.
[58:17.390 --> 58:21.730]  Also, Snoopy is not on these enough. This is ridiculous.
[58:22.890 --> 58:26.110]  They were really highlighting the human kids back in the day.
[58:26.510 --> 58:29.490]  But yeah, the cherry one with Charlie Brown, they were all good.
[58:30.050 --> 58:30.450]  Pineapple?
[58:33.490 --> 58:37.150]  I don't understand why peppermint patty would be on a strawberry.
[58:38.310 --> 58:39.270]  It doesn't make any sense.
[58:39.830 --> 58:43.790]  They decided to sunset it.
[58:44.750 --> 58:49.750]  I've been thinking about those specifically a lot lately. I don't know why, just because I loved them when I was a kid and they popped into my head.
[58:50.190 --> 58:54.550]  And so anytime I go to a fast food restaurant, I've been endeavoring to get the little apple pie.
[58:55.090 --> 58:56.010]  Or whatever pie they have.
[58:56.010 --> 59:02.930]  And I gotta be honest with you guys, I think the world is sleeping on these fucking little fruit pies.
[59:03.550 --> 59:07.010]  I think that they are rife for a comeback.
[59:07.670 --> 59:10.130]  And we should be on the ground floor.
[59:10.530 --> 59:13.010]  We should start getting into hand pies.
[59:13.310 --> 59:15.850]  In a big way. Because they are fucking delicious.
[59:16.450 --> 59:17.470]  And they're easy.
[59:19.750 --> 59:20.710]  Hostess TMNT!
[59:23.350 --> 59:24.850]  That's another great one.
[59:25.370 --> 59:28.110]  I do agree that people are sleeping on them.
[59:28.630 --> 59:33.710]  I think that the problem is they haven't changed in such a long time.
[59:33.830 --> 59:38.430]  That you know what you're getting and you know what you're getting is kind of like whack.
[59:39.530 --> 59:41.750]  It's great when you're a kid and then you have one as an adult.
[59:41.910 --> 59:44.810]  And you go, where did all the filling go? What is this?
[59:45.270 --> 59:50.410]  Because I got one not too long ago and I enjoyed it, but not as much as when I was a child.
[59:50.410 --> 59:53.450]  Is it because the child versions would be illegal now?
[59:53.530 --> 59:55.290]  Just because of too much sugar or something?
[59:56.470 --> 01:00:00.490]  I bet they're pretty close to the same. I bet the sugar is a little different.
[01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.530]  But also when you're a kid, your brain isn't formed.
[01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:08.890]  This tastes like magic because you've had seven flavors in your life.
[01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.090]  I think that has a lot to do with it.
[01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:16.070]  And most things when you're a kid, you're having it for the first time. Or maybe the second time.
[01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:18.890]  So everything is new and exciting.
[01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:21.990]  Like I said, I've been eating them a lot lately.
[01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:28.790]  So I had one at McDonald's the other day that wasn't great, but I had one at that same McDonald's a week later that knocked my dick off of my body.
[01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:31.230]  It was so good. So I think it's a bit of hit or miss.
[01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:35.110]  But there are still some... I'm just saying, I just want to put this out there.
[01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:38.410]  Because I want everybody to have it in the back of your head.
[01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.590]  Don't sleep on these things. Maybe give one a try sometime soon.
[01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:45.270]  I really do think that as a society, we're missing the boat right now.
[01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.150]  How do you feel about savory ones?
[01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.770]  I need an example. Like meat and peas and all that?
[01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:56.770]  Is there a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on it still? Sure. I'm into it.
[01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.610]  I'd be willing to give it a try. I'd be willing to give it a try.
[01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:05.970]  But it's definitely like a dessert in my head. But I'm okay with giving a meat pie a try.
[01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:07.990]  You've got two hands. It's true.
[01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:11.410]  Very good point. It is a great point.
[01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:14.650]  You could stuff a salad in one and have an appetizer one too. A whole meal.
[01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:18.410]  Salad pie? It's the worst.
[01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:24.110]  I'm becoming a new kind of guy, by the way.
[01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:28.050]  I'm going to become...
[01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:31.370]  a lawn guy. You're going to become a lawn guy?
[01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:35.130]  Howard, what are you doing with your lawn? I'm excited. I'm going to mow it.
[01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.050]  I'm less excited. What do you mean?
[01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:42.130]  Why would that be an exciting thing?
[01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.330]  I've been mowing my lawn for 49 years.
[01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:48.610]  It fucking sucks to mow your lawn.
[01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:53.930]  Really? I suddenly was looking at my lawn and thought, I want to mow that. I want to buy a lawn mower and mow it.
[01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.530]  Do you want to come over and mow my lawn?
[01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:02.790]  God no. I want to mow my lawn. I immediately fired the guy who's been mowing it for the last nine years.
[01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:04.370]  What? I ordered a mower.
[01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:09.170]  Wait, what? I could have given you a lawn mower.
[01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:12.490]  I sold my house. I don't need mine.
[01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:17.810]  I gave it to the movers. Have you done it yet?
[01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:22.130]  No. It's fine. Are you sure that you're a lawn guy?
[01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:24.870]  Well, I don't... I'm going to become one.
[01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:28.270]  Wait, have I jumped into this too soon? No, you're fine.
[01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:34.050]  Yeah, think about this, Eric. He finds manual labor charming.
[01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.030]  And he loves the sun.
[01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.970]  And he loves to be out in the sun. It's like the perfect activity.
[01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:44.490]  I love power washing and painting walls.
[01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.930]  I love finishing the square.
[01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:51.510]  I understand. I get that. I don't mind mowing my lawn.
[01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:57.170]  The act of mowing my lawn is fine. It's not the act that is the bothersome thing.
[01:02:57.170 --> 01:03:01.410]  It is the... alright, well, it's Friday and I have some time.
[01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.630]  Is this what I'm doing with my time? I'll put it off for a day.
[01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:09.330]  Uh-oh, it's Saturday. I gotta do this thing. Oh, shit, I put it off for another day.
[01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:12.570]  Uh-oh, it's Sunday. It's only getting longer.
[01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:16.510]  And this is forever. I don't think I would procrastinate that.
[01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:20.370]  I think I would use that as my procrastination. Really?
[01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:25.450]  You'll learn not to procrastinate pretty fast because once it gets out of control, it's like three times the work.
[01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.930]  Ah, shit.
[01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:33.130]  We are on completely different ends of this spectrum, which I love. I'm loading up procrastination.
[01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.650]  I'm throwing it on. I'm putting the weights on the procrastination scale.
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.950]  I'm excited when I have laundry to fold or something.
[01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:46.010]  Because it's like, ooh, I'm going to sit down and fold laundry and watch an episode of something.
[01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:47.070]  Instead of edit.
[01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:50.050]  What are you guys watching right now?
[01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.650]  Every Denzel movie available.
[01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:54.770]  Oh, right, right.
[01:03:54.870 --> 01:04:01.070]  He Got Game, I watched. That's a good movie. The Mighty Quinn.
[01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:05.150]  He Got Game is Ray Allen, right? Isn't he the one that plays Jesus Shuttlesworth? Yeah.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.860]  Antoine Fisher. That movie is a real bummer when you realize it's a true story.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.020]  That was unfortunate.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.820]  I didn't realize it was a real thing until it ended.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:21.740]  Survivor just ended. It was one of the best seasons in a long time, I thought.
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.840]  I didn't watch any of it. I need to watch it.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.560]  Have you guys seen that show, Expedition from Hell on HBO? No.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.820]  It's a documentary about this Israeli special forces dude who in his 60s
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:38.800]  to fight to raise money for cancer awareness for kids that have cancer
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.720]  because he's a cancer survivor. He decides he's going to cross
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.300]  the entirety of the Amazon from one coast to the other, 5,000 straight miles.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.340]  Nobody's ever done it in the history of humanity.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.480]  It's a documentary about him being a lunatic and probably a charlatan
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.160]  and stealing money and all kinds of nonsense that goes along with it.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.500]  It's pretty insane. I liked it.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.400]  Can I propose that I want to watch something with some of you guys?
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.240]  I don't know that... I want to watch it by myself.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.600]  Gavin's going to have no interest, but Geoff, I think maybe you do.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.960]  Is it Eraserhead? I'll watch it with you. I watched it with Gavin.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:22.500]  Are you watching Clipped? I haven't watched it yet, but I'm going to.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:26.820]  Me neither. I want to watch it also just because I keep seeing the comparisons
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.960]  of the players to the people who play them.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.540]  It makes me want to watch it
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.560]  so bad.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.200]  I really want to watch it because it looks goofy as shit.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.280]  I think this is supposed to be J.J. Reddick
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.580]  and Chris Paul.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.060]  Let's have a watch party when I get home from Boston.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.120]  If you want to watch that, I will sit down
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.480]  and we can stream it together and watch it.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.320]  You're going to Boston to watch the game?
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.980]  I'm going to Boston to the game. They're playing Dallas.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.000]  What are you doing?
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.260]  Did not cross my mind.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.600]  That's insane.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:26.220]  Allow me to retort. First off, it's a birthday present to me from my wife.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.680]  Secondly, I have
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.280]  the opportunity to see Boston play in the finals at the Garden
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.880]  and you think I'm going to pass that up? There's no way in hell
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.580]  I'm going to pass it up. Make no mistake about it, I'm going to Dallas
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:46.140]  to see a second finals game. I will go to two finals games and if it goes to seven, I'll go to three
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:49.660]  and sell some blood or something. But I didn't have any say so over the first game.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.500]  That was my wife booking a trip for me for my birthday.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:57.460]  It just never occurred to me that you were leaving the state of Texas to see this.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.940]  I'm doing more than that, dude. We're doing way more than that. We're going to Chicago and then
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.800]  Boston because my wife's sister
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.960]  is going to Chicago to surprise her best friend and her husband
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.900]  who are going to Chicago for the weekend and they're going to do an architectural tour on a boat
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:17.800]  so my wife's sister decided that she's just going to get tickets and show up
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.820]  on the boat and just run into them and be like, oh what a surprise, we're both here.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.020]  So Emily thought it would be funny if we also show up on the boat and surprise all of them.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.940]  So I'm getting up at four in the morning tomorrow to fly
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.920]  to Chicago so I can get on a 9am boat so I can
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.980]  surprise people. That's so awesome. Then I can turn around and go to
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:41.960]  Boston the next day to go see the Celtics play at home for game two
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.260]  of the finals and then I'll turn around and come right back to close on my house.
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.940]  It's like when we all woke up at five to surprise you in Vegas. Oh yeah, I'm returning the
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.680]  favor, but to different people. And your cousin almost blew it. You know, exciting stuff.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.860]  You know what I'm not doing? Guess what I'm not doing?
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.800]  What? A walking group and a sketched group.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.760]  I walked in, I booked it, and I
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.500]  did it on our company email so you guys know I'm busy at that time.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.060]  Those are nap hours. Nap time. So that's going to be in our company calendar?
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.800]  Yeah, it's on the calendar. At least I tried to.
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:21.940]  So am I going to get an alert for this? I think you should. It's Saturday, you're going to see it.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.900]  I got it booked from nine until noon. That'll be the time for us all
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.120]  to start calling Andrew's Umidigi and try to wake him up.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.200]  I never thought I would have to interact
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.120]  with that Umidigi so much. I have to interact
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.360]  with it later because I have to log into stuff.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.040]  So I gotta Umidigi fucking codes after this thing. So let's wrap up
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.000]  so we can do some Umidigi codes.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:53.180]  That's the plan. So that's forever, huh? This freaking Umidigi situation?
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.200]  No, you're going to send me a phone. Oh! Yeah, remember how that
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.780]  was supposed to happen? One last thing as we wrap up and
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.100]  Gavin gets the phone ready. When we were first starting,
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:09.300]  I asked everybody what year they were born in because I was putting something together for SoAllRight
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.480]  and I had so much fun with it. I thought I would do it with y'all too.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:16.940]  Do you guys know what the number one song in Billboard
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.500]  was the year you were born? Just off the top of your head.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.360]  No. I looked it up for everybody.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.500]  Okay. Mine, 1975, the Billboard
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.580]  number one year end song, or the song for the year, is
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:33.400]  Unfortunately, Love Will Keep Us Together by Captain and Tennille.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:38.480]  Which is an absolute dog shit song.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.420]  How does that go?
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.040]  Love will keep us together.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.040]  It's so fucking stupid.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.360]  Did you know in that song there's singing words?
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.660]  Did you know it's songs or words?
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.380]  So my top three are so brutal. It's Love Will Keep Us Together, Rhinestone Cowboy,
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.760]  and Philadelphia Freedom, which is like the only bad Elton John song.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.200]  That's rough trade, bud. Real rough trade. Real bummer.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.900]  But for Eric, you were born in 1986, I knew years because
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.860]  same year as my wife. The number one song of the year, it's a good one,
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:22.080]  That's What Friends Are For by Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight, Elton John, and Stevie Wonder.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:25.820]  So solid, solid song. That's cool. I don't love that song, but
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:30.160]  you know, it's like, it's not Captain and Tennille, so that's fine. It's good. It's a great song.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.940]  Nick, I think, might have
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.780]  my favorite of all the songs, even though I guess it hasn't aged well. Nick,
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:42.080]  you were born in 1987, the number one song in 1987 was Walk Like an Egyptian
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.000]  by the Bangles. Awesome!
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.960]  Great fucking song.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:52.140]  Great video. 1988 is the year that Gavin Free
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:55.140]  was born, and I gotta say, this is maybe
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:00.080]  yeah, this is maybe the most apropos song
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.600]  even the top five, top four for Gavin are insane.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.340]  Gavin, do you off the top of your head know what the number one song was the year you were born? I don't.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:11.760]  By a fellow Brit, George Michael, it was Faith. Oh, wow!
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.780]  Number two was Need You Tonight by
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.820]  NXS. Number three was Got My Mind Set On You by George Harrison. Number four was Never Gonna
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:23.700]  Give You Up by Rick Astley. It was a very Brit-heavy year. I would say that's for Bangles.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.740]  That was pretty fucking good, man. And I would associate you
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.640]  with most of those songs, except for Need You Tonight. I'm pretty sure I've listened to all those songs
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.620]  every year since I've been born. Yeah, I bet you have.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:39.380]  And then pulling up the rear is Andrew, born in
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.420]  1994, the number one song
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:47.660]  in 1994 was Ace Of Bass, The Sign.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.820]  Yeah! That is your birth song.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.420]  So I think out of everybody, I think Nick probably won, and I feel like I lost. I definitely have the shittiest
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.340]  song. But it was fun. You should go through and look at the list of top 100, because there's all kinds of
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.420]  stuff in there that you'll be like, oh fuck, that's crazy, that was the year I was born. That is all I'm going to think about
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:07.340]  the rest of the day. I'll do that. Like, I'm The Only One by Melissa
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.400]  Etheridge was on your birth year, Andrew. Crazy.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.280]  I thought that was crazy. Any opera in the top 100?
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.940]  Do you want to sing us out, Andrew, with some of your opera? Yeah, alright, here we go.

[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:41.680]  today.
