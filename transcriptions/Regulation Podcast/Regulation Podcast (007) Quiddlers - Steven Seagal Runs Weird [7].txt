[00:00.000 --> 00:02.920]  I have a question that I brought up in the last episode.
[00:03.660 --> 00:05.240]  Why? Why?
[00:05.400 --> 00:08.740]  Why isn't there terminology in movies like there is in video games?
[00:09.480 --> 00:10.700]  In what way?
[00:11.140 --> 00:13.680]  Is every movie first person?
[00:14.040 --> 00:15.520]  Is it a first person film?
[00:16.080 --> 00:20.020]  Oh, you're saying like that's like also also you realize
[00:20.020 --> 00:21.080]  that that's not just games, right?
[00:21.080 --> 00:21.820]  That's like books.
[00:25.040 --> 00:28.900]  You realize that that's not just video games like that's like literature, right?
[00:28.900 --> 00:31.260]  Yeah. First, first. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
[00:31.360 --> 00:34.520]  I just am not as much of a book guy, so I don't think about clearly.
[00:34.800 --> 00:38.660]  Yeah, no, 100%. So I think there's only
[00:38.660 --> 00:41.580]  I think Hardcore Henry is maybe like the only first person movie.
[00:41.780 --> 00:45.620]  I was trying to do. Famously had some first person shots.
[00:45.740 --> 00:47.700]  And there are scenes with the first person in it.
[00:47.780 --> 00:51.180]  But technically, is like what perspective are films?
[00:51.840 --> 00:54.220]  Third. Third. Third. OK.
[00:55.480 --> 00:57.360]  Third. So a ground. Yeah, OK.
[00:59.080 --> 01:00.400]  All right. All right.
[01:00.940 --> 01:02.800]  Is it? It is. Yeah.
[01:02.820 --> 01:06.020]  Well, I just I never thought about the camera being attached to the person.
[01:06.120 --> 01:06.880]  I guess. I don't know.
[01:07.280 --> 01:10.200]  I was thinking about the perspective of the camera to the world.
[01:10.880 --> 01:14.600]  Oh, OK. What about like Blair Witch?
[01:15.380 --> 01:17.900]  Blair Witch. Well, that's that is first person, right?
[01:18.340 --> 01:21.980]  It has to be right. I would I would think so. Somewhat.
[01:23.280 --> 01:25.480]  Can you think of a single top down movie?
[01:26.300 --> 01:27.760]  Anyone made a full top down?
[01:28.780 --> 01:31.360]  I don't know. Let me know if you think of a top down book.
[01:35.920 --> 01:37.080]  Now, when are we going to get Gavin?
[01:37.160 --> 01:38.160]  Is he already a minute late?
[01:38.600 --> 01:41.260]  No, I'm not. Well, he just didn't say anything.
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.380]  Yeah, I was here at three.
[01:44.060 --> 01:45.120]  Just without saying anything.
[01:45.700 --> 01:46.940]  Here we go. All right. I'm going to start it off.
[01:47.660 --> 01:51.460]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:51.460 --> 01:53.600]  I believe this is episode number seven.
[01:53.900 --> 01:55.960]  I don't see anybody enter it into the discord.
[01:55.960 --> 01:56.520]  There we go.
[01:57.260 --> 01:59.940]  My name is Geoff Ramsey with me, as always.
[02:00.360 --> 02:03.040]  Andrew Pantin, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour.
[02:03.620 --> 02:05.200]  Name a top down film, Gavin.
[02:06.260 --> 02:07.020]  Planet Earth.
[02:08.140 --> 02:08.880]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08.940 --> 02:10.360]  Planet Earth. Some ants.
[02:11.100 --> 02:13.200]  Is there a full one, though?
[02:13.320 --> 02:15.520]  Like I'm there sequences like John Wick four.
[02:15.660 --> 02:18.660]  I just watched that has a long top down sequence.
[02:19.760 --> 02:22.440]  Which felt like a video game. Contra.
[02:23.880 --> 02:25.460]  That would be fucking awesome
[02:25.460 --> 02:29.260]  if they made a Contra movie and it was just top down the entire time.
[02:29.540 --> 02:30.960]  That would be real cool.
[02:31.620 --> 02:32.600]  I can get behind that.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.760]  Speaking of Contra, do you guys play Ikari Warriors?
[02:36.840 --> 02:38.460]  No, it sounds yes.
[02:38.460 --> 02:39.120]  With yeah.
[02:39.220 --> 02:43.720]  With Ralph and Clark, who were folded into the King of Fighters and SNK franchise.
[02:43.820 --> 02:44.760]  Thank you. Oh, really?
[02:45.160 --> 02:46.820]  Well, I was going to ask if you played the Ikari Warriors,
[02:46.900 --> 02:49.460]  did you ever play the Rambo top down
[02:50.480 --> 02:52.260]  Sega Sega Master System game?
[02:52.560 --> 02:53.560]  Yeah, I remember that.
[02:53.800 --> 02:55.200]  That game was fucking awesome.
[02:55.200 --> 02:57.440]  I said, yeah, that game is so slept on.
[02:57.540 --> 02:58.220]  I don't know why.
[02:58.980 --> 03:03.040]  It was such a I is Ikari Warriors, the one where you're like dressed in pink
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.340]  and you get here and you like dance back a little bit.
[03:07.840 --> 03:08.840]  I don't remember that.
[03:09.220 --> 03:12.440]  But dressed, that's a that's that's like pink and purple and shit.
[03:12.960 --> 03:13.320]  Rambo.
[03:14.560 --> 03:15.620]  Oh, that was awesome.
[03:16.260 --> 03:18.900]  It was Ikari Warriors is a similar sort of this.
[03:18.980 --> 03:20.000]  Is that what you're thinking of, Gavin?
[03:20.480 --> 03:21.620]  Is that pink and purple to you?
[03:24.640 --> 03:26.360]  Yeah, I see the pink and purple.
[03:26.720 --> 03:27.720]  Yeah, well, that's it.
[03:27.860 --> 03:28.520]  All right. Great job.
[03:28.660 --> 03:33.720]  OK, is Rambo the most films to like worst film ratio?
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.040]  Because I'd argue there's like two good Rambo movies, but there's six of them.
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.100]  Terminator.
[03:40.260 --> 03:43.280]  Mm. Two really good Terminators, though.
[03:43.960 --> 03:46.200]  Yeah. And then how many Terminator movies are there?
[03:47.340 --> 03:48.600]  Is the last one good?
[03:48.620 --> 03:49.720]  I didn't see the last one.
[03:49.720 --> 03:52.300]  I felt like people some people like the last Terminator movie.
[03:52.640 --> 03:54.960]  No, no. And let me tell you this.
[03:55.340 --> 03:57.760]  It's the only Terminator movie Tobin's seen.
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.680]  What? Oh, really?
[03:59.900 --> 04:04.100]  Went with him to the theater to watch like Terminator seven or whatever
[04:04.100 --> 04:04.900]  the fuck it was.
[04:05.300 --> 04:08.440]  And he's like, I've never seen he's.
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.000]  That's so funny.
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.100]  Yeah, didn't they have Linda Hamilton?
[04:14.600 --> 04:15.500]  They did a comeback.
[04:15.780 --> 04:16.240]  Yeah.
[04:17.360 --> 04:18.380]  I thought people liked that.
[04:18.440 --> 04:19.220]  That's a bad one.
[04:19.220 --> 04:19.960]  That's disappointing.
[04:20.480 --> 04:21.260]  Yeah, yeah, it sucked.
[04:23.400 --> 04:25.320]  Man, I was excited to watch it.
[04:25.460 --> 04:26.680]  Genesis is so bad.
[04:26.960 --> 04:27.300]  Oh, yeah.
[04:27.540 --> 04:29.480]  Genesis, Genesis.
[04:30.560 --> 04:32.160]  Which one was Genesis?
[04:32.320 --> 04:33.440]  Was that the one with?
[04:34.300 --> 04:35.040]  Emilia Clarke.
[04:35.620 --> 04:36.780]  Emilia Clarke in it?
[04:37.140 --> 04:37.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:37.740 --> 04:38.440]  Emilia Clarke in it.
[04:39.240 --> 04:40.340]  They recreate it.
[04:40.420 --> 04:41.480]  It feels like fan fiction.
[04:41.840 --> 04:43.240]  It's a very weird movie.
[04:43.300 --> 04:44.500]  Yeah, it's really bad.
[04:44.620 --> 04:46.420]  Terminator Salvation is fucking terrible, too.
[04:46.600 --> 04:47.220]  Yeah. Yeah.
[04:47.220 --> 04:48.540]  I forget that that one exists.
[04:48.540 --> 04:50.080]  Which one's Terminator 3?
[04:50.480 --> 04:51.420]  Good for you.
[04:54.600 --> 04:58.300]  Terminator 3 is the one that came out in the early 2000s.
[04:58.540 --> 04:58.820]  With Claire Danes?
[04:58.820 --> 05:00.060]  It's the casket gun one.
[05:00.500 --> 05:01.520]  Oh, yeah. Claire Danes.
[05:01.700 --> 05:01.860]  Yeah.
[05:02.600 --> 05:03.800]  Right. Claire Danes is in that one.
[05:03.880 --> 05:04.500]  That was OK.
[05:04.980 --> 05:07.680]  Whereas Battery is about to pop and then they throw it out of the car
[05:07.680 --> 05:09.060]  and it's like a nuke going off.
[05:09.200 --> 05:10.760]  Yeah. Yeah. Fucking terrible.
[05:10.960 --> 05:11.720]  God, that movie sucks.
[05:11.720 --> 05:12.600]  Where the whole thing...
[05:12.600 --> 05:12.980]  That movie sucked.
[05:13.340 --> 05:15.300]  Terminator 3 was OK because it ended well.
[05:15.300 --> 05:20.100]  It ended like they got tricked into going into safety for the nuclear.
[05:20.280 --> 05:22.920]  They thought they were stopping the nuclear war, but they they weren't.
[05:22.960 --> 05:23.460]  They never were.
[05:23.540 --> 05:25.200]  Yeah, they like they turned off the cameras.
[05:25.580 --> 05:25.640]  They were just being protected.
[05:26.000 --> 05:26.520]  Yeah. Yeah.
[05:26.520 --> 05:27.500]  And they were done with the movie.
[05:27.620 --> 05:28.680]  Like, that was my favorite part.
[05:34.480 --> 05:36.820]  It it's tough to have a good franchise.
[05:37.800 --> 05:41.240]  I feel like Vin Diesel's trying to do like seven franchises
[05:41.240 --> 05:42.560]  and one of them has worked.
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.960]  But he feels like a real franchise guy to me.
[05:45.640 --> 05:48.820]  Fast and Furious, but like Riddick didn't really work out.
[05:49.840 --> 05:52.420]  He wanted The Last Witch Hunter to be a big franchise.
[05:52.680 --> 05:53.620]  That didn't work out.
[05:54.840 --> 05:57.040]  I mean, God is the galaxy, I would say worked out.
[05:57.320 --> 05:59.840]  He's very... I don't think he gets any credit for that.
[06:00.180 --> 06:03.120]  No, he stood on stilts to record his lines.
[06:03.280 --> 06:04.720]  He's definitely fully involved.
[06:05.880 --> 06:06.820]  Did he really?
[06:07.380 --> 06:09.600]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[06:10.400 --> 06:11.660]  He... I love Vin Diesel.
[06:11.660 --> 06:14.480]  You could hear the stilts in his performance.
[06:14.480 --> 06:18.160]  Yeah, he had to get into the perspective of a tree, even though he's a little...
[06:18.160 --> 06:18.940]  He's a tiny tree.
[06:19.580 --> 06:21.080]  Most of that film.
[06:23.880 --> 06:26.640]  Eric posted a photo of him doing the I am Groot thing.
[06:27.320 --> 06:31.280]  Do you think after Groot was small, he like shoes on his knees
[06:31.280 --> 06:32.760]  like Dorf recorded his lines?
[06:33.140 --> 06:36.760]  He started he started crawling around on the floor like Rady Boy.
[06:37.160 --> 06:38.140]  He's a Rady Boy crawl.
[06:38.680 --> 06:41.860]  If they were ever to resurrect the like re reboot
[06:42.380 --> 06:46.240]  reboot, the Dorf franchise for 2024, I'm throwing
[06:46.240 --> 06:49.620]  I'm throwing Vin Diesel in as my pick.
[06:49.740 --> 06:53.420]  I want him to be the new Tim Conway in that franchise.
[06:54.420 --> 06:56.320]  I think that would be...
[06:56.320 --> 06:57.700]  Oh, I would love it.
[06:58.100 --> 06:59.460]  I've never seen a Dorf.
[07:00.080 --> 07:01.020]  You're not missing out.
[07:01.540 --> 07:03.240]  Maybe we'll blindside you with one someday.
[07:03.940 --> 07:06.880]  I'd love it because I've heard about it a lot, but never.
[07:07.800 --> 07:11.560]  Dorf on Golf as a small child, I thought was absolutely hilarious.
[07:12.200 --> 07:16.420]  It's one of those things that was definitely family
[07:16.420 --> 07:19.580]  friendly, early 80s comedy.
[07:20.380 --> 07:24.020]  That if we watch now might not be family friendly at all in 2024.
[07:24.360 --> 07:26.760]  I don't know. It'd be really interesting to see, you know.
[07:27.360 --> 07:29.120]  I'd be really nervous about it, for sure.
[07:29.820 --> 07:31.220]  What was the other little blokes called?
[07:31.520 --> 07:33.200]  Like Quiddlers or something?
[07:33.360 --> 07:34.040]  Was it Quiddlers?
[07:34.660 --> 07:37.740]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[07:38.120 --> 07:39.700]  Quiddlers? Quiddlers?
[07:39.700 --> 07:42.340]  Quiddlers is the first...
[07:43.440 --> 07:47.100]  Quiddlers is the first part of the title.
[07:47.520 --> 07:48.020]  Quiddlers?
[07:48.520 --> 07:50.060]  Oh, they have a website.
[07:50.880 --> 07:54.960]  I remember seeing the Quiddlers on TV when I was like eight, maybe.
[07:55.860 --> 07:57.960]  Oh, that's not...
[07:57.960 --> 07:58.980]  What are the Quiddlers?
[07:59.680 --> 08:00.720]  Pretty offensive, actually.
[08:01.080 --> 08:01.720]  Oh, wow.
[08:01.920 --> 08:02.360]  What the fuck?
[08:02.360 --> 08:04.080]  It's like the village people, but small?
[08:04.520 --> 08:06.860]  But I don't think... I think they are on their knees, though.
[08:07.480 --> 08:07.800]  Alright.
[08:09.180 --> 08:10.300]  Oh, here...
[08:10.300 --> 08:11.360]  Here they are.
[08:11.620 --> 08:13.420]  Here they are as the Blues Brothers.
[08:16.680 --> 08:18.480]  Oh, the 90s.
[08:20.520 --> 08:23.140]  So that's your jam, huh, Gavin?
[08:23.340 --> 08:24.220]  You're a Quiddler guy?
[08:24.760 --> 08:25.460]  Apparently I was.
[08:27.280 --> 08:29.780]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, because it was Michael Jackson.
[08:29.940 --> 08:32.280]  I remember seeing Michael Jackson...
[08:32.280 --> 08:33.520]  Quiddling around.
[08:34.280 --> 08:35.500]  So they just do like...
[08:35.500 --> 08:36.720]  They just do songs, then.
[08:36.840 --> 08:37.960]  They're a musical act.
[08:39.320 --> 08:42.960]  I honestly haven't seen or thought about it in 30 years,
[08:43.060 --> 08:44.320]  so I don't entirely remember.
[08:44.460 --> 08:45.940]  I was legitimately a child.
[08:46.520 --> 08:46.700]  Okay.
[08:47.640 --> 08:48.600]  They do have a website.
[08:48.980 --> 08:49.660]  I'm having trouble remembering it.
[08:50.200 --> 08:53.600]  It's a physical comedy group based in Las Vegas.
[08:53.940 --> 08:54.880]  When did they disband?
[08:56.400 --> 08:57.560]  I can't get it to load.
[08:57.660 --> 08:58.360]  I mean, hold on.
[08:58.460 --> 08:58.780]  Here we go.
[08:59.040 --> 08:59.700]  We got a...
[08:59.700 --> 09:01.180]  They got a Wikipedia.
[09:02.940 --> 09:07.740]  Currently, the latest incarnation of the Quiddlers under Ebagers Creative Direction
[09:08.560 --> 09:10.100]  is a cabaret show in Vegas.
[09:10.860 --> 09:11.920]  Are they still going?
[09:12.060 --> 09:13.020]  Yes, they're still.
[09:13.200 --> 09:14.960]  I wonder if they're still doing Smooth Criminal.
[09:15.640 --> 09:17.660]  They're on America's Got Talent wiki,
[09:17.900 --> 09:20.800]  and it says that they're a puppeteer group from season three
[09:20.800 --> 09:23.320]  that got eliminated in the audition round.
[09:23.800 --> 09:28.300]  And then they returned for season 12, in which they got cut at the judge cuts.
[09:28.730 --> 09:30.500]  So I guess they never really did well.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.740]  They have made multiple appearances at NBA halftimes for the Charlotte Hornets,
[09:36.800 --> 09:39.840]  Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Pistons, Rockets, Spacers, Heat.
[09:40.080 --> 09:41.160]  Like everybody.
[09:41.880 --> 09:43.840]  The CBA as well.
[09:44.900 --> 09:45.880]  Good lord.
[09:46.880 --> 09:47.720]  Oh, they've appeared at the...
[09:47.720 --> 09:50.480]  They appeared at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show.
[09:52.280 --> 09:53.860]  They really hit the...
[09:53.860 --> 09:56.700]  Dude, they hit the auto circuit really hard in 1989.
[09:56.700 --> 09:59.620]  North American International Auto Show, Detroit, 1989.
[09:59.780 --> 10:01.080]  Chicago Auto Show, 1989.
[10:01.320 --> 10:03.120]  Cleveland International Auto Show, 1989.
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.360]  New York Auto Show, 1989.
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.600]  Baltimore, 1990.
[10:05.940 --> 10:07.120]  Dallas Auto Show, 1990.
[10:07.460 --> 10:08.240]  Nothing since.
[10:08.900 --> 10:12.300]  They hit those auto shows hard for a year and a half and then walked away.
[10:13.080 --> 10:17.500]  Nothing brings out decade repressed memories like this podcast.
[10:18.580 --> 10:23.080]  That quidd... knowing the quiddlers just in your soul is insane.
[10:23.340 --> 10:24.640]  That's like the truest thing you've ever said.
[10:24.740 --> 10:25.020]  Uh-huh.
[10:26.200 --> 10:26.600]  Unbelievable.
[10:27.900 --> 10:29.740]  That nothing brings out repressed memories like this podcast.
[10:30.160 --> 10:30.460]  Oh, okay.
[10:31.660 --> 10:32.560]  Yeah, I'm just agreeing with you.
[10:32.900 --> 10:33.300]  Thanks.
[10:33.860 --> 10:35.080]  You don't have to be on your...
[10:35.080 --> 10:36.780]  I have a... I have a game today.
[10:37.660 --> 10:38.060]  Oh!
[10:38.340 --> 10:39.800]  I don't know if we want to hop into a game.
[10:40.280 --> 10:40.680]  Let's do it.
[10:40.680 --> 10:41.700]  I would love to hop into a game.
[10:42.100 --> 10:45.560]  It was a long time ago on our previous podcast.
[10:46.240 --> 10:47.460]  It was called F*** Face.
[10:48.240 --> 10:57.060]  And we were talking about people's teeth and would be able to recognize the person by their teeth on the Ian F*** Face logo.
[10:57.360 --> 10:58.400]  Oh, Jesus.
[10:58.800 --> 10:59.360]  Oh, God.
[11:00.600 --> 11:01.400]  Oh, boy.
[11:01.540 --> 11:01.860]  Okay.
[11:02.260 --> 11:03.080]  All right, round one.
[11:03.540 --> 11:03.840]  Okay.
[11:04.080 --> 11:05.300]  Let's see some teeth.
[11:06.080 --> 11:07.120]  Oh, no.
[11:08.080 --> 11:10.200]  I hate this game already.
[11:10.460 --> 11:10.860]  Why?
[11:11.820 --> 11:14.340]  It... it's just very unpleasant.
[11:14.840 --> 11:16.720]  Now, is that going to be one of the five of us?
[11:17.300 --> 11:17.500]  Yeah.
[11:18.420 --> 11:18.820]  Oh.
[11:19.060 --> 11:19.380]  Oh.
[11:19.500 --> 11:19.700]  Okay.
[11:19.920 --> 11:20.600]  Sorry for the audience.
[11:20.760 --> 11:21.980]  This is a very visual bit.
[11:21.980 --> 11:22.560]  Yeah, it is.
[11:22.780 --> 11:25.580]  On YouTube, this might be better to watch there or look at the Instagram.
[11:25.980 --> 11:30.760]  Yeah, I'll definitely make sure to post all these images on the Instagram so you suffer along with us.
[11:31.960 --> 11:38.420]  It's like... it's like that Conan O'Brien skit where they would just like put a picture of Bill Clinton up and then have the mouth, you know, have somebody's mouth behind it.
[11:39.140 --> 11:40.300]  It's really disturbing.
[11:40.540 --> 11:41.500]  How do we give you the answers?
[11:42.520 --> 11:43.760]  Just say who you think it is.
[11:44.560 --> 11:44.940]  Okay.
[11:45.240 --> 11:46.040]  I think that's Eric.
[11:46.040 --> 11:47.120]  Yeah, I think it's Eric.
[11:47.660 --> 11:49.200]  Really? My teeth look that white?
[11:50.240 --> 11:51.080]  I think...
[11:51.080 --> 11:51.400]  Yeah.
[11:52.480 --> 11:52.720]  Maybe.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.180]  Well, it's definitely not me because they're all real teeth.
[11:55.300 --> 11:55.740]  It's not me.
[11:58.200 --> 12:00.420]  I guess it's thinking Gracie, maybe?
[12:00.820 --> 12:01.560]  From the Krutof?
[12:02.980 --> 12:03.820]  Oh, it...
[12:03.820 --> 12:05.360]  We just said it's one of the five of us, didn't we?
[12:05.820 --> 12:06.040]  Yeah.
[12:06.780 --> 12:07.160]  Oh, okay.
[12:07.460 --> 12:08.800]  Okay, so your guess is Gracie.
[12:11.320 --> 12:14.860]  Gracie's angle up her teeth, though, would be the best perspective for this panel.
[12:15.860 --> 12:19.480]  People making that into the Jaws poster was really fucking great.
[12:19.660 --> 12:20.700]  It was so good.
[12:21.220 --> 12:23.060]  I want to get into the Krutof after this.
[12:25.080 --> 12:26.500]  I guess it is...
[12:26.500 --> 12:26.940]  Yeah.
[12:27.300 --> 12:28.460]  I guess it's me?
[12:28.740 --> 12:30.600]  I don't think my teeth are that straight.
[12:31.820 --> 12:32.800]  Yeah, that's right.
[12:32.960 --> 12:33.360]  That's Eric.
[12:34.000 --> 12:34.660]  Is it really?
[12:34.980 --> 12:35.300]  Wow.
[12:35.680 --> 12:37.500]  I got some nice toppers there, bud.
[12:37.560 --> 12:38.600]  You're not doing too bad, dude.
[12:38.920 --> 12:39.360]  Great job.
[12:39.400 --> 12:39.920]  You know what?
[12:39.940 --> 12:40.220]  Decent toppers.
[12:40.800 --> 12:41.620]  It is me.
[12:41.620 --> 12:45.920]  Do you know how long, like, what's the original photo that, like, the teeth are from? Do you know?
[12:50.620 --> 12:52.880]  Like, that was a question in the past, I suppose.
[12:53.200 --> 12:53.380]  Yeah.
[12:54.160 --> 12:55.360]  You can just say no.
[12:55.880 --> 13:00.120]  Yeah, it's you doing your, I'm small, little curled up against the mic thing.
[13:00.140 --> 13:00.340]  Oh, okay.
[13:00.900 --> 13:01.620]  Oh, wow.
[13:03.520 --> 13:13.080]  Okay, because if you look all the way on the back, I guess right-hand side, where, like, underneath, like, where the C would be and fuck, there's a black gap there.
[13:13.080 --> 13:15.720]  It's because I'm missing a tooth all the way in the back.
[13:15.840 --> 13:17.080]  I had to get it extracted.
[13:17.380 --> 13:18.540]  So I guess that is me.
[13:18.840 --> 13:19.560]  That makes sense.
[13:20.040 --> 13:21.460]  Actually, it's just you smiling on a couch.
[13:21.980 --> 13:23.380]  I had to change that one.
[13:24.200 --> 13:24.560]  What?
[13:24.860 --> 13:25.040]  What?
[13:25.140 --> 13:25.360]  Wait.
[13:25.920 --> 13:26.800]  It's not that you're small.
[13:26.980 --> 13:27.640]  What about this one?
[13:29.500 --> 13:30.640]  Oh, that's clear.
[13:30.720 --> 13:31.120]  I know.
[13:31.240 --> 13:31.860]  That's easy.
[13:32.640 --> 13:33.800]  That's, yeah, that's...
[13:33.800 --> 13:36.420]  Those are the lips of Andrew, uh, Panton.
[13:36.780 --> 13:37.700]  I would recognize them anywhere.
[13:37.780 --> 13:39.880]  Old toothless fucker.
[13:39.880 --> 13:40.360]  Me.
[13:41.800 --> 13:43.800]  Still never seen your teeth, I'm convinced of it.
[13:44.640 --> 13:45.500]  What about this one?
[13:47.000 --> 13:47.220]  Oh.
[13:47.660 --> 13:48.060]  That's...
[13:48.060 --> 13:48.760]  That's me.
[13:49.380 --> 13:49.740]  That's Nick.
[13:49.740 --> 13:49.920]  That's Nick.
[13:50.200 --> 13:50.880]  It has to be Nick.
[13:51.040 --> 13:51.560]  That's the guy.
[13:51.620 --> 13:55.540]  Nick's looks, like, freakishly natural in a way that is very odd.
[13:56.220 --> 13:58.200]  That looks like it should be there.
[13:58.920 --> 14:00.660]  It's also old-timey and black and white.
[14:00.700 --> 14:02.480]  The black and white makes it look like I'm gonna eat you.
[14:02.480 --> 14:03.260]  Oh.
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.440]  I think if we had to pick so far, I would say Nick's are the regulation ENT.
[14:10.980 --> 14:12.500]  That is a nightmare.
[14:12.800 --> 14:13.820]  100% Gavin.
[14:14.160 --> 14:14.880]  Yeah, definitely.
[14:14.880 --> 14:15.680]  And that would be me.
[14:16.660 --> 14:16.960]  Yeah.
[14:17.400 --> 14:20.480]  That's from this picture of me and my granddad.
[14:25.680 --> 14:26.160]  Oh.
[14:26.660 --> 14:27.660]  Last but not least.
[14:29.060 --> 14:29.800]  Oh, yeah.
[14:30.020 --> 14:30.520]  Oh, boy.
[14:30.560 --> 14:31.460]  That's fair, there you go.
[14:31.460 --> 14:32.700]  Now, here's the thing.
[14:32.860 --> 14:35.760]  I was with Andrew that Nick's look like the regulation teeth.
[14:35.860 --> 14:38.740]  I think the black and white really helps to, like, really set it in there.
[14:38.860 --> 14:45.320]  But something about Geoff's big mouth, his gob just smack in the middle of that thing really fits for Ian to me.
[14:45.380 --> 14:48.140]  You can feel the joy in the smile.
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.340]  Geoff's is hitting me with, like, annoying orange vibes is the way I feel about it.
[14:53.680 --> 14:54.520]  Oh, yeah.
[14:54.920 --> 14:57.240]  Yeah, Geoff, you look like the annoying orange.
[14:57.980 --> 14:59.060]  Yeah, I'll take that.
[14:59.060 --> 15:03.600]  You know, while we're at it, I've always gotten Jenna Marbles vibes from Andrew.
[15:03.780 --> 15:05.060]  So it's like, I can see that.
[15:07.700 --> 15:10.100]  And Eric's really mystery guitar man.
[15:10.840 --> 15:11.000]  Yeah.
[15:11.160 --> 15:12.060]  Oh, big time.
[15:12.360 --> 15:12.760]  Absolutely.
[15:14.280 --> 15:22.600]  The thing that made me laugh the most while I was doing this, aside from these stupid teeth pictures, is that I wanted to remove the original teeth from the sketch.
[15:23.060 --> 15:23.340]  Uh-huh.
[15:23.400 --> 15:28.660]  So I used Photoshop to... I just selected it and then did, like, a content-aware delete thing.
[15:28.660 --> 15:31.380]  Where it's supposed to just fill it with the surroundings.
[15:32.240 --> 15:34.280]  This is the abomination that it made.
[15:35.060 --> 15:36.380]  Oh, my God!
[15:37.180 --> 15:38.520]  What the fuck?
[15:39.220 --> 15:41.820]  It made a face! It made an Ian face!
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.680]  Look, the eyes and nose and a mouth! Holy shit!
[15:44.900 --> 15:48.520]  I'm gonna go ahead and make the thumbnail right now for this episode. That's perfect.
[15:48.520 --> 15:53.000]  Now it's a guy with a lump on his head, like Tom and Jerry, looking really pissed.
[15:53.300 --> 15:54.060]  Oh, my God.
[15:54.220 --> 15:55.560]  Where did it get that from?
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.840]  That's AI shit right there, dude.
[15:57.840 --> 15:58.760]  Oh, my God.
[15:58.760 --> 15:59.840]  That's why we shouldn't use AI.
[16:00.240 --> 16:00.560]  No.
[16:01.040 --> 16:01.960]  That's terrifying.
[16:01.960 --> 16:03.520]  That's insane.
[16:04.180 --> 16:04.540]  Kill it.
[16:04.800 --> 16:06.220]  I kinda wanna get a tattoo.
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.000]  Oh, a full back tattoo of just that?
[16:12.380 --> 16:17.320]  It looks like a creepy man who got hit on the head with a... like an anvil.
[16:17.780 --> 16:18.200]  Yes.
[16:18.360 --> 16:18.580]  Yeah.
[16:19.800 --> 16:21.500]  And his lump has nostrils.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.280]  Yeah, and he's got a nostril lump.
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.840]  And the eyes are almost like eggs. Like, they...
[16:28.140 --> 16:30.580]  They do look like hard-boiled eggs.
[16:31.280 --> 16:35.420]  I was photoshopping, and when I did that, I legitimately went, bah!
[16:36.820 --> 16:37.220]  Yeah.
[16:37.500 --> 16:39.860]  It scared the shit out of me. It was so big on my screen.
[16:39.860 --> 16:42.240]  You made a demon. You created hell.
[16:42.480 --> 16:44.300]  It's the fucking funniest thing I've ever seen.
[16:46.020 --> 16:46.340]  That's insane.
[16:46.340 --> 16:47.340]  And that's the end of my game.
[16:47.760 --> 16:48.080]  Wow.
[16:48.080 --> 16:48.640]  That's a good game.
[16:48.820 --> 16:49.120]  Good game.
[16:50.880 --> 16:56.200]  When I was thinking about this game, I thought at first it was going to be like trying to recognize celebrity teeth, or like movie teeth.
[16:56.780 --> 16:58.740]  Doing this made me realize there's no way.
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.740]  Because in a pool of us, it was still difficult. The first one, especially.
[17:04.420 --> 17:08.800]  Like, it took essentially removing the pool to four to make it more obvious.
[17:09.540 --> 17:12.080]  I don't think I'd be able to recognize celebrity teeth based on this.
[17:12.680 --> 17:16.480]  Well, maybe we should... well, also, how much do you look at celebrity teeth, though?
[17:16.480 --> 17:17.480]  Not often.
[17:17.700 --> 17:20.080]  Like, I just think it's a detail you don't register.
[17:20.380 --> 17:23.620]  I'm looking at y'all's teeth constantly. I think about them all the time.
[17:23.800 --> 17:28.460]  Also, celebrity teeth now are all the same.
[17:28.780 --> 17:30.600]  Everyone's veneers or whatever.
[17:31.080 --> 17:31.640]  Like, Furiosa...
[17:31.640 --> 17:33.900]  Everyone's picked number three out of the catalog.
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.160]  Yeah, Chris Hemsworth just put in, like, fake teeth.
[17:38.240 --> 17:40.600]  And he went, whoa, I look crazy!
[17:40.940 --> 17:43.080]  For, like, the screen tests of Furiosa.
[17:43.320 --> 17:45.920]  And it's like, those are just normal teeth. You have normal human teeth.
[17:45.920 --> 17:46.760]  What, an idiot?
[17:49.080 --> 17:52.620]  This is a regulation Shopify ad.
[17:53.040 --> 18:04.060]  You know, when I started in this online entertainment journey 21 years ago with the very first websites Gus and I put together,
[18:04.660 --> 18:10.500]  the idea of selling merchandise online seemed like science fiction to me.
[18:10.500 --> 18:17.200]  And then as Rooster Teeth was born and we started creating merchandise and we had to figure out how to get it to people,
[18:17.640 --> 18:21.280]  it went from being science fiction to just very, very, very difficult.
[18:21.560 --> 18:28.480]  And I've watched this industry evolve over the years, essentially from its inception to where it is now.
[18:28.480 --> 18:33.900]  And for the last, gosh, probably decade, I was at the previous company.
[18:34.080 --> 18:40.600]  We used Shopify and it handled an incredibly large e-commerce business.
[18:40.980 --> 18:43.020]  And it handled it with ease.
[18:43.340 --> 18:48.240]  And now I'm in a situation where I'm starting up a very small e-commerce business.
[18:48.420 --> 18:55.560]  And I find Shopify is again here to help out and handle my e-commerce needs with ease.
[18:55.560 --> 19:01.580]  It is the global e-commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your business.
[19:01.660 --> 19:07.860]  Like I said, from a tiny little podcast like Regulation to a giant company like Rooster Teeth.
[19:08.180 --> 19:15.900]  From the launch your online shop stage to the first real life store stage all the way to the, did we just hit a million orders stage?
[19:16.020 --> 19:17.440]  Oh my gosh, fingers crossed, right?
[19:17.840 --> 19:21.980]  Shopify will be there to help you grow. I've seen it in the past. I'm excited to see it in the future.
[19:21.980 --> 19:27.820]  Whether you're selling scented soap, which I'm completely and totally amenable to.
[19:28.040 --> 19:30.980]  And if the guys want to sell, like maybe we could sell waffle bomb soap.
[19:31.200 --> 19:35.140]  Or offering outdoor outfits, that I'm less excited about.
[19:35.440 --> 19:37.660]  Shopify helps you sell everywhere.
[19:38.080 --> 19:42.800]  From their all-in-one e-commerce platform to their in-person POS system.

[20:04.980 --> 20:10.520]  With the internet's best converting checkout up to 36% better compared to other leading commerce platforms.
[20:10.620 --> 20:13.000]  36% is a significant number.
[20:13.000 --> 20:18.180]  Think of it like this, if you have a whole cherry pie.
[20:18.600 --> 20:19.520]  It's probably 8 slices.
[20:19.940 --> 20:23.320]  You eat a third of a cherry pie, your day is over.
[20:23.800 --> 20:24.460]  That's a lot.
[20:24.920 --> 20:28.720]  36% in cherry and sugar, significant.
[20:29.120 --> 20:34.080]  Plus, Shopify's extensive help resources are there to support your success every step of the way.

[20:56.300 --> 20:58.540]  Hey, I also have a game.
[20:58.640 --> 21:03.480]  We can't play it today, but I want to pitch it to y'all as a potential future game and see what you think.
[21:03.720 --> 21:04.880]  I pitched it to Gavin already.
[21:04.880 --> 21:08.980]  He seemed to like it okay, so I wanted to see what y'all thought about it, if that's okay.
[21:09.100 --> 21:09.660]  What's the game?
[21:09.940 --> 21:11.820]  I call it Cemetery Bingo.
[21:12.480 --> 21:12.840]  Okay.
[21:13.580 --> 21:18.760]  We go to a cemetery, and then we play bingo with the headstones.
[21:19.080 --> 21:20.300]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[21:21.140 --> 21:25.380]  Somebody who has three first names, like James Earl Mike.
[21:26.120 --> 21:28.200]  Somebody who died on their birthday.
[21:28.740 --> 21:31.760]  Somebody who dies one day before or after their birthday.
[21:31.760 --> 21:33.140]  Somebody who was born on Christmas.
[21:33.660 --> 21:35.020]  Somebody who has the same name as you.
[21:35.260 --> 21:36.140]  A famous name.
[21:36.380 --> 21:37.560]  Two people with the same name.
[21:38.220 --> 21:41.420]  Maybe somebody whose name was a job, like their last name was Carpenter.
[21:41.860 --> 21:45.120]  The oldest tombstone you could find, like the first one in.
[21:46.500 --> 21:47.180]  What else do we have?
[21:47.300 --> 21:47.880]  Longest liver.
[21:48.080 --> 21:49.200]  Somebody who lived the longest.
[21:49.300 --> 21:50.060]  The person you could find the longest.
[21:50.140 --> 21:50.900]  Somebody with a nickname.
[21:51.120 --> 21:53.680]  Somebody with a quote on their tombstone.
[21:54.160 --> 21:55.560]  Somebody who was buried at sea.
[21:56.180 --> 21:57.740]  That's what we called it in the car on the way home last night.
[21:57.780 --> 21:58.760]  Longest liver we came up with.
[21:58.820 --> 21:59.780]  Someone buried at sea?
[21:59.940 --> 22:01.080]  Did they put a gravestone down for this?
[22:01.080 --> 22:03.200]  Yeah, apparently a lot of people will put gravestones out.
[22:03.340 --> 22:04.480]  Burndog was talking about it last night.
[22:04.720 --> 22:08.420]  It's his favorite thing to do when he goes to a cemetery is look for buried at sea headstones.
[22:09.920 --> 22:11.480]  Why is he going to a cemetery?
[22:12.820 --> 22:13.960]  Why does anybody go to a cemetery?
[22:14.680 --> 22:16.260]  Probably to look at dead stuff.
[22:16.900 --> 22:18.300]  I mean, you've seen his art.
[22:18.680 --> 22:20.680]  Like, you know what the fuck he does.
[22:20.800 --> 22:22.280]  Of course he goes to the cemetery.
[22:22.420 --> 22:23.300]  I haven't seen his art.
[22:23.760 --> 22:24.360]  The guy paints skulls and demons for a living.
[22:24.360 --> 22:25.480]  You haven't seen his art?
[22:25.680 --> 22:26.900]  No, I just know he is an artist.
[22:26.900 --> 22:27.640]  I haven't seen his art.
[22:27.940 --> 22:28.160]  Oh.
[22:28.180 --> 22:28.500]  Hold on.
[22:28.500 --> 22:28.820]  Here.
[22:29.060 --> 22:29.200]  Oh.
[22:30.280 --> 22:30.640]  So...
[22:31.880 --> 22:32.240]  Fucking...
[22:32.240 --> 22:34.380]  His shit is wild.
[22:35.300 --> 22:35.940]  He just...
[22:35.940 --> 22:37.680]  He paints this by hand.
[22:37.760 --> 22:38.440]  Oh, okay.
[22:38.520 --> 22:38.760]  Never mind.
[22:38.900 --> 22:39.380]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[22:39.480 --> 22:40.820]  Totally, totally get it.
[22:41.060 --> 22:41.560]  Never mind.
[22:41.580 --> 22:42.480]  Yeah, no, that's...
[22:42.480 --> 22:42.900]  That reads.
[22:43.200 --> 22:43.580]  That checks.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  That's kind of his deal.
[22:46.880 --> 22:47.260]  That makes sense.
[22:47.260 --> 22:47.940]  Oil paints, too.
[22:48.120 --> 22:48.580]  All oil.
[22:48.920 --> 22:49.360]  I was...
[22:49.360 --> 22:51.840]  Because my next question was going to be, like, why...
[22:51.840 --> 22:54.780]  How would you be in a position to want to gamify a cemetery?
[22:55.240 --> 22:56.560]  Like, how often...
[22:56.560 --> 22:57.280]  This all reads.
[22:57.280 --> 22:58.680]  I used to...
[22:58.680 --> 23:02.440]  I used to live by a cemetery at one point, and I would go there for walks or to ride
[23:02.440 --> 23:05.860]  my bike sometimes, because it's just, like, a big open area of space, and it's just, like...
[23:05.860 --> 23:08.140]  It's kind of like going to the park sometimes, you know?
[23:09.040 --> 23:13.400]  And I was just thinking about, like, how much fun we had with Sloppy Joe's Bingo and
[23:13.400 --> 23:18.700]  making games out of stuff that's just kind of sitting there and kind of trying to repurpose
[23:18.700 --> 23:18.940]  it.
[23:18.980 --> 23:24.420]  And I thought, cemeteries are wonderful places to go and have some quiet meditation or silence
[23:24.420 --> 23:29.020]  or go spend a little bit of time with a loved one that you miss, but they could also be
[23:29.020 --> 23:29.620]  something else.
[23:29.860 --> 23:35.000]  Like, a place to have a fun little game that isn't insulting to the dead people at all,
[23:35.360 --> 23:38.780]  in much the same way that Sloppy Joe's Bingo is not insulting to the people that we're
[23:38.780 --> 23:39.560]  calling bingo on.
[23:40.120 --> 23:43.340]  We're not being derogatory towards them in any way.
[23:43.440 --> 23:46.980]  We're just, you know, finding interesting little things about their lives or what we
[23:46.980 --> 23:51.420]  can glean from the tombstone, and, you know, you try to find, I don't know, little...
[23:52.040 --> 23:54.860]  those little interesting nuggets to turn into bingo.
[23:55.480 --> 24:02.000]  I feel like you need to have somebody in the cemetery that you know to play.
[24:02.520 --> 24:05.980]  I feel like that's my... that would be my moral hurdle with it.
[24:06.480 --> 24:08.700]  I think I would need to have skin in the game.
[24:09.080 --> 24:12.700]  What if you only... here was a... because we were talking about this last night.
[24:12.920 --> 24:19.360]  Are you being unintentionally insulting in some way?
[24:19.360 --> 24:22.020]  Or disrespectful, because that would certainly never want to do that.
[24:22.420 --> 24:25.240]  The solution we came up with in the car on the way home last night is,
[24:25.360 --> 24:29.260]  what if you could only play it with people who died before the oldest person playing
[24:29.260 --> 24:29.660]  was born?
[24:31.460 --> 24:34.360]  So, like, 1975 would be the cutoff for us.
[24:34.720 --> 24:36.720]  Anybody after 1975 couldn't be considered.
[24:37.260 --> 24:38.760]  Why? And why is that?
[24:39.640 --> 24:42.440]  Because they're so far dead, they never lived in our world.
[24:45.040 --> 24:48.320]  So it's not like... it's not like we're being insulting to somebody who died
[24:48.320 --> 24:51.260]  last month and you're going to go, that was my... that was my aunt, you dickhead.
[24:51.720 --> 24:55.360]  You were talking about her name. It's like, no, that person's been dead for 50, 49 years.
[24:55.360 --> 24:58.720]  Yeah, but that could still be an old guy who comes to see his wife every week.
[24:59.420 --> 25:01.920]  That's... that's the issue with the hurdle.
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.280]  We're not being insulting in the cemetery to anybody.
[25:05.280 --> 25:06.980]  We're just walking around and looking at tombstones.
[25:07.260 --> 25:10.960]  So to an outward looker, it would just be a bunch of us just going like, hmm.
[25:11.420 --> 25:12.480]  I mean, it wouldn't look disrespectful.
[25:12.480 --> 25:15.220]  It'd look like anybody at a cemetery ever. Yeah.
[25:15.860 --> 25:19.560]  The problem is gamifying it. Yes, I agree.
[25:19.720 --> 25:26.220]  So here's what I think is where we would cross the line is that it would just be like four or five adult men
[25:26.220 --> 25:29.120]  walking around the cemetery, giggling, laughing and pointing.
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.300]  Oh, God forbid we add a little joy to a sad place like a cemetery.
[25:33.300 --> 25:34.960]  You're saying that we're not being disrespectful.
[25:35.200 --> 25:41.600]  I'm just telling you that from a perception standpoint, it's maybe questionable.
[25:41.600 --> 25:47.880]  My point is, is this nothing we're doing is making fun of anybody in the cemetery.
[25:48.920 --> 25:51.760]  No, like that is fine.
[25:52.120 --> 25:58.540]  I think the issue would be the perception of somebody who has a loved one in the cemetery
[25:58.540 --> 26:02.420]  being like, I'd rather you not put them into your game.
[26:03.540 --> 26:06.700]  Which is why you would you would choose people from.
[26:06.960 --> 26:08.600]  Well, I mean, it's a public place, first of all.
[26:08.980 --> 26:11.460]  So there is the that of it.
[26:11.460 --> 26:17.280]  But also, I think that by not using anybody who died in your lifetime, you're really reducing the chances
[26:17.280 --> 26:22.660]  that somebody is going to see that you mentioned their uncle's name in passing
[26:22.660 --> 26:26.580]  because his name was Carpenter or I don't know, Shipwright or whatever.
[26:27.140 --> 26:28.480]  And it happens to be the name of a job.
[26:28.760 --> 26:32.900]  Didn't you say as well that the human race doesn't give a shit about anything 50 years ago or something?
[26:33.420 --> 26:34.180]  That's also true.
[26:34.400 --> 26:38.940]  50 years is when we stop giving a shit about the past or understanding it or trying to understand it.
[26:38.940 --> 26:41.500]  And it starts to disappear into the nothingness.
[26:41.620 --> 26:45.920]  So if anything, maybe we're bringing a little bit of life back to a bunch of people that died a long time ago
[26:45.920 --> 26:47.680]  that probably aren't getting a lot of attention.
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.380]  Well, that is a way to put it, but that would not be my intent.
[26:52.520 --> 26:54.840]  From a ghost standpoint, they probably fucking love it.
[26:55.220 --> 27:00.860]  I don't necessarily care that this person died or whatever.
[27:01.060 --> 27:03.960]  I'm really pumped about the bingo and my discovery of them.
[27:04.300 --> 27:05.500]  Yeah, if that makes sense.
[27:05.500 --> 27:09.280]  Like, I don't... it's not that... I don't know.
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.580]  I like the idea a lot, I just think there are some hurdles to be considered.
[27:14.120 --> 27:19.520]  What if we test out this idea by going into a cemetery in a video game?
[27:20.120 --> 27:21.460]  I like that a lot.
[27:21.460 --> 27:21.960]  That's a great idea.
[27:22.460 --> 27:23.460]  I think that is great.
[27:25.500 --> 27:26.160]  I'm all about it.
[27:26.720 --> 27:29.160]  What, uh... Red Dead Friday has some?
[27:29.600 --> 27:30.780]  Friday the 13th has one.
[27:31.800 --> 27:32.520]  Yeah, but it's small.
[27:32.520 --> 27:34.580]  I'm looking right now to see.
[27:34.580 --> 27:36.860]  Oh, dude, you know who has a cemetery?
[27:37.760 --> 27:44.080]  One of the Mortal Kombat games, you progress through a cemetery.
[27:44.520 --> 27:46.200]  That's how the game progresses, right?
[27:46.760 --> 27:48.100]  Like 9 or 8, maybe?
[27:48.320 --> 27:49.720]  Resident Evil 4 has one.
[27:50.780 --> 27:53.620]  Does Left 4 Dead have a cemetery? It feels like they would have a cemetery.
[27:53.660 --> 27:55.000]  Yeah, it does.
[27:56.080 --> 27:58.760]  That seems like something that Valve would have the...
[27:58.760 --> 28:02.540]  Oh yeah, we gotta make sure these are all unique.
[28:02.540 --> 28:05.320]  They would have got each staff member to put in a different thing.
[28:05.400 --> 28:07.320]  Yeah, exactly. That's how that feels.
[28:08.820 --> 28:09.800]  This is good.
[28:10.060 --> 28:12.160]  We should definitely try this.
[28:12.160 --> 28:13.040]  I'm a big fan of that.
[28:13.120 --> 28:14.900]  I love the idea of more bingo.
[28:15.360 --> 28:16.880]  Like just as a general thing.
[28:17.420 --> 28:21.820]  Look, all I'm saying is I'm happy to do it in a video game, but cemeteries are just sitting there.
[28:21.980 --> 28:24.360]  I lived by one for a few years a few years ago.
[28:24.560 --> 28:26.980]  They're largely empty. Nobody's ever there.
[28:27.100 --> 28:28.220]  They're lonely places.
[28:28.220 --> 28:34.060]  I would go there sometimes and be the only person I saw there for like an hour if I walked through it.
[28:34.240 --> 28:43.540]  And I just feel like we could give them a little use in a fun way without being disrespectful to anybody interred there or visiting.
[28:46.640 --> 28:50.220]  Redfield... Redfall has a lot of cemetery in it.
[28:51.020 --> 28:51.640]  I haven't played that game.
[28:52.140 --> 28:52.720]  Is that a good game?
[28:54.800 --> 28:57.740]  There are good things about it, but it's confused.
[28:58.140 --> 29:01.100]  And the studio that made it recently got shut down.
[29:01.280 --> 29:04.040]  So it'll never sort those things out.
[29:04.380 --> 29:07.980]  I'm playing Still Wakes the Deep.
[29:08.300 --> 29:09.740]  Has anyone else tried that?
[29:09.860 --> 29:13.920]  I would highly recommend you especially try it, Geoff.
[29:14.260 --> 29:16.940]  It's the thing, but on an oil rig.
[29:16.940 --> 29:23.580]  It's like the deep sea, like you're out in the middle of the ocean and there's like eldritch horror shit, right?
[29:23.980 --> 29:24.420]  What's it called?
[29:25.140 --> 29:26.580]  Still Wakes the Deep.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.260]  You're on an oil rig and it's set in Scotland.
[29:30.900 --> 29:32.760]  And it is the thing.
[29:33.360 --> 29:33.880]  Is it multiplayer?
[29:34.640 --> 29:38.380]  No, it is a single player horror experience.
[29:38.880 --> 29:40.240]  But I'm having so much fun with it.
[29:40.320 --> 29:43.360]  I played it for like, I don't know, maybe two hours last night.
[29:43.360 --> 29:44.720]  It was so scared.
[29:44.980 --> 29:49.700]  And I have a clip that I don't know if it would translate all that well on the podcast.
[29:49.800 --> 29:56.240]  But like the whole thing is you are on this oil rig and you're drilling and then something happens.
[29:56.340 --> 29:58.180]  And like this alien thing has taken over.
[29:58.520 --> 30:05.000]  And people that come in contact with it get turned into like crazy people that are trying to kill you type thing.
[30:05.020 --> 30:08.360]  And it's very visually disturbed horror.
[30:08.720 --> 30:13.060]  And I just encountered the very first monster that you have to deal with.
[30:13.060 --> 30:18.000]  And the whole time in the game whenever you see, like you'll find coffee cups on the ground that you can pick up and throw.
[30:18.400 --> 30:21.120]  And I thought, oh I bet you, like these aren't weapons.
[30:21.260 --> 30:27.260]  This strikes me as like maybe you can try to throw them to a different corner of the room to distract so you can hide.
[30:27.680 --> 30:29.540]  And so I'm so scared.
[30:29.720 --> 30:31.420]  It is completely freaked me out.
[30:31.660 --> 30:33.480]  And I encounter this first monster.
[30:33.900 --> 30:36.300]  And you can like hide in vents and stuff.
[30:36.620 --> 30:38.780]  And so I'm in a vent and I find a coffee cup.
[30:39.040 --> 30:42.340]  And it says like you can throw it to distract the monster.
[30:42.340 --> 30:43.960]  It will guide it to another place.
[30:44.280 --> 30:46.500]  And I fucking knew it. I called it. I knew it would be this.
[30:46.920 --> 30:48.320]  So I grabbed the coffee cup.
[30:48.720 --> 30:49.820]  And I went to throw it.
[30:50.300 --> 30:51.240]  And it was dark.
[30:51.660 --> 30:53.380]  And I completely fucked up the throw.
[30:53.740 --> 30:56.320]  And instead of throwing it to the other corner of the room.
[30:56.680 --> 30:58.600]  I hit the pipe directly above me.
[30:58.860 --> 31:00.220]  And it bounced back at me.
[31:00.560 --> 31:03.920]  And landed right in front of the grate that I was hiding behind.
[31:04.180 --> 31:07.900]  And that monster sprinted right to the grate in front of me.
[31:08.160 --> 31:10.040]  It made me the most scared I've ever been in a game.
[31:10.040 --> 31:12.620]  Because I didn't... since it's the first encounter.
[31:12.860 --> 31:14.340]  I don't know how the rules work.
[31:14.380 --> 31:15.300]  And if it could see me.
[31:15.400 --> 31:16.980]  Because there's just nothing in front of me.
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  I'm just in a little vent.
[31:18.280 --> 31:19.860]  And we're equal to each other.
[31:20.060 --> 31:22.620]  And I just sat there for like 90 seconds.
[31:22.860 --> 31:25.340]  As the monster like analyzed the cup.
[31:25.500 --> 31:26.560]  And then went back and forth.
[31:26.720 --> 31:27.720]  And then went away.
[31:28.120 --> 31:29.320]  And that was it for me.
[31:29.420 --> 31:30.980]  I haven't gone back to that game yet.
[31:31.260 --> 31:31.500]  But...
[31:31.500 --> 31:32.100]  Did you save a clip?
[31:32.760 --> 31:33.980]  I do. Yeah, I have a clip.
[31:34.060 --> 31:36.140]  Let me see. I can pull it up.
[31:37.660 --> 31:39.280]  It's... but it was terrifying.
[31:39.280 --> 31:40.680]  I'd highly recommend it.
[31:40.920 --> 31:42.920]  It has a really cool achievement in it.
[31:43.020 --> 31:44.510]  To play through the game in Gaelic.
[31:45.380 --> 31:49.820]  Because it's funny where they have English subtitles on by default.
[31:50.480 --> 31:53.900]  And it's not as like a thing of where the dialogue matches.
[31:54.200 --> 31:56.180]  It is to translate Scottish slang.
[31:56.760 --> 32:01.220]  Which I don't think I've ever played a game that has a feature like that.
[32:01.940 --> 32:03.620]  It is a lot of...
[32:03.620 --> 32:05.860]  The English text will say fuck.
[32:06.020 --> 32:08.280]  And the audible dialogue will be fud.
[32:08.280 --> 32:10.940]  I've never heard so many fuds dropped.
[32:12.860 --> 32:15.360]  Let me see if I can upload this.
[32:15.860 --> 32:17.700]  But I would highly recommend it.
[32:18.440 --> 32:19.900]  As someone who loves the thing, Geoff.
[32:20.600 --> 32:21.640]  Like I know you do.
[32:22.080 --> 32:24.600]  I think you'd enjoy it even though it's single player and not multiplayer.
[32:25.480 --> 32:26.640]  Yeah, I'll check it out.
[32:27.580 --> 32:29.320]  I don't know when.
[32:29.700 --> 32:31.860]  Because you're right, I don't play a lot of single player anything.
[32:32.380 --> 32:33.220]  But I'll give it a shot.
[32:33.840 --> 32:35.380]  What was the last single player game you played?
[32:37.600 --> 32:38.040]  Uh...
[32:43.300 --> 32:46.360]  I played Far Cry 6 for a day.
[32:47.360 --> 32:48.300]  Was that single player?
[32:49.140 --> 32:50.840]  Yeah, I mean there's multiplayer in it.
[32:50.920 --> 32:52.200]  But yeah, you can play single player.
[32:52.560 --> 32:54.220]  Before that I played Cyberpunk.
[32:54.660 --> 32:56.380]  I beat that, so that's single player.
[32:57.380 --> 33:00.980]  I think it's so funny that you are multiplayer only essentially.
[33:01.200 --> 33:04.120]  And then Eric is on the other side of that spectrum.
[33:04.120 --> 33:06.700]  Essentially exclusively single player.
[33:06.860 --> 33:08.700]  I used to be single player only.
[33:08.920 --> 33:09.840]  And I didn't give a shit about multiplayer.
[33:09.980 --> 33:10.700]  And I just kind of flipped.
[33:10.900 --> 33:13.080]  Because games are just...
[33:13.080 --> 33:14.500]  If I'm going to play a game now.
[33:14.620 --> 33:17.160]  I either want to be hanging out with my friends.
[33:17.500 --> 33:18.540]  Like shooting the shit.
[33:18.840 --> 33:19.860]  Or I want to be working.
[33:20.320 --> 33:22.860]  And so single player games have zero appeal to me.
[33:23.120 --> 33:24.100]  At this point in my life.
[33:24.220 --> 33:26.020]  Because I'm not making anything with them.
[33:26.320 --> 33:27.280]  For the most part.
[33:27.520 --> 33:32.080]  Unless I'm like doing backgrounds for Nick.
[33:32.080 --> 33:32.680]  Or something.
[33:33.540 --> 33:35.860]  Yeah, and then if there's no multiplayer.
[33:36.140 --> 33:37.960]  There's no Xbox Live party with Spotify music.
[33:38.120 --> 33:39.680]  It just doesn't appeal.
[33:40.940 --> 33:42.660]  I've been doing some editing.
[33:43.340 --> 33:44.720]  Editing some Let's Plays we've been doing.
[33:44.920 --> 33:45.840]  Some of the multicams.
[33:46.160 --> 33:48.760]  And I looked and it had been exactly 10 years.
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.740]  Since my last multicam.
[33:50.800 --> 33:52.400]  Which was like a Minecraft video.
[33:53.280 --> 33:55.380]  So it's fun to dust off all that.
[33:55.800 --> 33:58.220]  But I forgot how much I just hate everyone.
[33:58.740 --> 33:59.560]  When I'm editing.
[34:01.640 --> 34:03.120]  What does that mean?
[34:03.760 --> 34:05.200]  Well I've got some examples.
[34:09.400 --> 34:09.880]  Discord.
[34:10.200 --> 34:10.340]  Alright.
[34:10.480 --> 34:10.840]  Paste.
[34:11.740 --> 34:14.760]  That's my waveform from Gears of War 5.
[34:15.200 --> 34:15.840]  Part 1.
[34:17.120 --> 34:18.720]  It's all contained.
[34:19.380 --> 34:20.060]  It's pretty level.
[34:20.500 --> 34:22.760]  Not a lot of dynamic range.
[34:24.900 --> 34:26.620]  Geoff, any thoughts about where this is going?
[34:26.760 --> 34:27.320]  Here's Geoff.
[34:27.820 --> 34:28.900]  It's all the way down.
[34:29.000 --> 34:29.620]  It's all the way up.
[34:29.620 --> 34:31.660]  Fitz Peak is blowing out like you wouldn't believe.
[34:31.740 --> 34:32.300]  It's crazy.
[34:33.300 --> 34:34.780]  And then somehow.
[34:35.520 --> 34:37.340]  To my ear, Andrew sounded worse.
[34:38.080 --> 34:39.320]  And I looked at his waveform.
[34:40.560 --> 34:42.240]  Clipped all the way across.
[34:42.820 --> 34:43.420]  Oh no!
[34:43.660 --> 34:45.960]  Actually not at the top of the thing.
[34:46.180 --> 34:48.280]  Which I don't see a lot of that.
[34:49.080 --> 34:50.820]  Nick, is it always like this?
[34:51.060 --> 34:52.240]  Not always, sometimes.
[34:53.100 --> 34:54.080]  What's going on there?
[34:54.340 --> 34:55.480]  I don't know.
[34:55.540 --> 34:57.640]  I run a de-clip on it and it usually takes care of it.
[34:57.640 --> 35:00.180]  But when he does gaming for some reason,
[35:00.380 --> 35:02.040]  his audio just...
[35:02.040 --> 35:02.820]  Clips out.
[35:03.340 --> 35:05.780]  What can I do to make your life easier, Gavin?
[35:06.320 --> 35:07.680]  I've never heard this issue.
[35:08.060 --> 35:08.940]  What can I do to help?
[35:09.420 --> 35:12.700]  I have a compressor on so I don't blow out that much.
[35:13.180 --> 35:13.680]  That's true.
[35:13.840 --> 35:14.960]  It keeps everything down.
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.480]  Does my Scarlett have a compressor?
[35:18.100 --> 35:18.500]  I don't know.
[35:19.340 --> 35:21.760]  Not built in, but there might be a program we could use.
[35:22.100 --> 35:22.920]  We could look at it.
[35:23.180 --> 35:25.760]  Also, Andrew, we'll just play with your game.
[35:25.760 --> 35:27.400]  I think that'll take care of it.
[35:27.480 --> 35:27.920]  Okay.
[35:29.020 --> 35:29.800]  Sounds good.
[35:29.960 --> 35:30.760]  Sorry, Gavin.
[35:33.640 --> 35:34.460]  I feel so bad.
[35:36.220 --> 35:36.980]  I'm absolved.
[35:37.080 --> 35:39.840]  None of my audio is this bad, so I rock.
[35:40.220 --> 35:41.420]  Me and Gavin are great.
[35:42.200 --> 35:43.900]  I'm pretty sure yours was...
[35:43.900 --> 35:45.600]  You're not in this video, which is why I don't have one.
[35:45.600 --> 35:47.220]  Yeah, exactly. So I'm good.
[35:47.500 --> 35:50.540]  Your one from GTA was a nightmare.
[35:51.260 --> 35:52.500]  No, no, no.
[35:52.740 --> 35:53.360]  It was good.
[35:55.340 --> 35:56.520]  Consider that it was good.
[35:56.780 --> 35:58.760]  So how much does a compressor cost?
[35:58.820 --> 35:59.780]  And should I buy one?
[36:00.700 --> 36:03.040]  Well, I mean, I think it's...
[36:03.040 --> 36:04.060]  Mine's just in my mixer.
[36:04.300 --> 36:05.160]  It's just like an option.
[36:05.940 --> 36:07.300]  We'll look into it, as Nick said.
[36:07.820 --> 36:08.020]  Yeah.
[36:08.780 --> 36:11.720]  I'm willing to spend some money to fix the problem.
[36:12.000 --> 36:12.220]  Yeah.
[36:13.640 --> 36:15.580]  I'm willing to spend some money on your problem, too.
[36:19.800 --> 36:21.600]  Trying to make your life easier here.
[36:21.600 --> 36:22.260]  Mm-hmm.
[36:23.160 --> 36:25.660]  Speaking of the gaming, I have the clip.
[36:26.140 --> 36:26.620]  I can post.
[36:27.040 --> 36:29.820]  It didn't fucking freeze.
[36:30.060 --> 36:30.660]  What an annoyance.
[36:30.820 --> 36:33.560]  Does it have a clipping issue in it?
[36:33.800 --> 36:34.200]  With your audio?
[36:35.540 --> 36:36.220]  We'll find out.
[36:36.240 --> 36:38.160]  I need to get a compressor for my computer.
[36:39.980 --> 36:40.600]  Oh, my God.
[36:42.540 --> 36:43.160]  Oh, my God.
[36:44.040 --> 36:45.060]  Sorry. Go ahead, Eric.
[36:45.140 --> 36:46.340]  I was going to say...
[36:47.920 --> 36:50.160]  While Andrew wrestles with that, I guess,
[36:50.160 --> 36:52.000]  I want to give a shout-out to
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.760]  a regulation listener who's...
[36:53.760 --> 36:55.240]  I mean, a comment leaver, truly.
[36:56.800 --> 36:59.100]  This is from Donut Cool
[36:59.100 --> 37:01.140]  on the subreddit.
[37:01.300 --> 37:02.560]  They've been doing this weekly.
[37:03.020 --> 37:04.960]  They have been doing regulation drawings
[37:04.960 --> 37:06.920]  of each episode of Moments
[37:06.920 --> 37:07.960]  that stick out to them.
[37:08.200 --> 37:09.740]  I just want to shout them out.
[37:10.160 --> 37:11.800]  They are so good.
[37:12.100 --> 37:14.720]  They do this every week, and I look forward to it every week.
[37:14.800 --> 37:15.900]  I wanted to shout them out on the show
[37:15.900 --> 37:17.760]  because I think this is...
[37:17.760 --> 37:19.080]  The immunity bullet
[37:19.520 --> 37:21.540]  on a necklace is so cool.
[37:21.940 --> 37:23.780]  The emotional noises
[37:23.780 --> 37:25.440]  opera thing is so good.
[37:25.880 --> 37:26.880]  But Nick
[37:26.880 --> 37:28.820]  as the monkey
[37:28.820 --> 37:31.560]  being lured into a cartoon
[37:31.560 --> 37:33.460]  draft is so
[37:33.460 --> 37:35.740]  well-drawn. They draw it by hand
[37:35.740 --> 37:37.660]  like pencil and paper and just shoot
[37:37.660 --> 37:39.680]  a photo of it on their phone.
[37:39.980 --> 37:41.520]  They're not trying to be high-quality
[37:41.520 --> 37:43.820]  with it. It is just, here's an idea.
[37:44.020 --> 37:45.780]  And they scribble it. I love
[37:45.780 --> 37:47.640]  that they do this. I think it's fantastic.
[37:47.800 --> 37:49.800]  Thank you Donut Cool on the subreddit.
[37:50.200 --> 37:51.900]  That's exactly how I imagined it.
[37:54.220 --> 37:55.820]  Can I ask, without getting
[37:55.820 --> 37:57.580]  into a whole thing, can I ask an
[37:57.580 --> 37:59.760]  immunity bullet question that came to me?
[38:01.120 --> 38:01.920]  I'm not trying to
[38:01.920 --> 38:03.500]  relitigate. Andrew's not allowed to say
[38:03.500 --> 38:05.200]  of course. It's just
[38:06.120 --> 38:07.840]  I guess a specific scenario
[38:08.240 --> 38:09.540]  that I'd like to get cleared up, Gavin.
[38:09.620 --> 38:11.480]  If you had the immunity bullet, you had your one
[38:11.480 --> 38:13.560]  immunity bullet, and you could use it. You're immune from any
[38:13.560 --> 38:15.020]  kind of... Is that
[38:15.720 --> 38:17.100]  like, say you're Christian.
[38:17.780 --> 38:19.480]  You're pretty religious, and you
[38:19.480 --> 38:21.520]  shoot somebody, but you're immune to it,
[38:21.540 --> 38:22.900]  so that means you're cool with God, right?
[38:23.300 --> 38:25.460]  So then, if you're
[38:25.460 --> 38:27.080]  a Christian, or let's say God exists,
[38:27.220 --> 38:29.020]  or some form of God exists, and it's still
[38:29.020 --> 38:31.240]  a mortal sin to commit suicide, if you
[38:31.240 --> 38:33.480]  shot yourself with an immunity bullet, would you be good?
[38:34.420 --> 38:34.900]  Yeah, you would
[38:34.900 --> 38:37.400]  I mean, Eric was going to use the bullet
[38:37.400 --> 38:39.160]  for that last week, and we decided he would survive.
[38:39.160 --> 38:41.200]  That's what I was hoping. I didn't
[38:41.200 --> 38:42.880]  ask the question, I just
[38:42.880 --> 38:45.140]  I was going to roll the dice on, I was
[38:45.140 --> 38:46.300]  going to go to heaven for that.
[38:48.080 --> 38:49.180]  It seems like you'd be
[38:49.180 --> 38:50.860]  okay. I think you would walk it off.
[38:52.060 --> 38:52.460]  Fantastic.
[38:53.380 --> 38:55.220]  Okay, thanks. That's all. There's the clip.
[38:55.660 --> 38:56.100]  Oh, here we go.
[38:56.600 --> 38:59.240]  Yeah, do you want to
[38:59.240 --> 39:00.420]  sync up, and then
[39:01.620 --> 39:03.080]  3, 2, 1
[39:03.080 --> 39:03.700]  play.
[39:04.900 --> 39:07.140]  Okay, so you can see, I'm like, I'm walking
[39:07.140 --> 39:09.420]  around, I get into this vent, it's very dark.
[39:10.300 --> 39:11.100]  Whenever there's
[39:11.620 --> 39:13.440]  purple stuff around the screen, that
[39:13.440 --> 39:14.660]  means you're close to the enemy.
[39:16.460 --> 39:17.460]  That is the
[39:17.460 --> 39:19.480]  guy, I want to say, oh no, okay, here
[39:19.480 --> 39:21.420]  we go, flashlight on. So I'm trying
[39:21.420 --> 39:23.600]  to navigate, I'm really nervous
[39:23.600 --> 39:25.620]  these little pipes, or like, vents
[39:26.080 --> 39:27.200]  you can hide in
[39:27.720 --> 39:29.580]  anything painted yellow, so I'm
[39:29.580 --> 39:31.500]  tiptoeing, because that's him, right
[39:31.500 --> 39:33.140]  there, that's that monster thing.
[39:33.880 --> 39:35.580]  It's like a thing, so I'm like, coffee cup, got it.
[39:35.640 --> 39:37.600]  Throw it across the room. Oh, fuck!
[39:37.600 --> 39:39.040]  Oh, fuck, it bounced back!
[39:39.360 --> 39:41.640]  And it immediately runs right
[39:41.640 --> 39:43.620]  at the cup, and I'm just sweating.
[39:44.060 --> 39:45.340]  I'm like, oh my god.
[39:45.720 --> 39:47.500]  Oh, fuck. And since I've never
[39:47.500 --> 39:49.560]  encountered a monster before, I'm like, will
[39:49.560 --> 39:51.600]  it see me? Am I okay in here?
[39:52.080 --> 39:53.500]  Don't move, I'm just not gonna move.
[39:53.900 --> 39:55.660]  We're just not gonna move. Please
[39:55.660 --> 39:56.460]  don't come in here.
[39:57.200 --> 39:59.760]  And it goes back and forth, and it scans.
[40:00.220 --> 40:01.240]  I'm like, okay, I think it's gone.
[40:01.720 --> 40:03.660]  I think we're good. And it leaves,
[40:03.740 --> 40:05.700]  and then I just went to bed. I just shut the game
[40:05.700 --> 40:07.740]  off. I was like, I can't do this.
[40:08.100 --> 40:09.780]  This is too much. That could
[40:09.780 --> 40:11.720]  certainly go into a Worst Throws in
[40:11.720 --> 40:13.140]  Video Games compilation. Yeah.
[40:13.160 --> 40:15.820]  You have immediately sold me on that game. That looks awesome.
[40:15.900 --> 40:17.860]  Yeah, it looks great. It's really cool.
[40:18.260 --> 40:19.340]  What's wrong with that bloke?
[40:20.200 --> 40:21.780]  Uh, it's... I don't know. I think
[40:21.780 --> 40:23.820]  it's like a... He's just under the weather.
[40:24.400 --> 40:25.540]  Yeah. He's got
[40:26.000 --> 40:26.400]  shingles?
[40:27.380 --> 40:29.600]  I think that's why you want to get that vaccine.
[40:30.420 --> 40:31.820]  Buy a Ratty Boy video game.
[40:32.000 --> 40:32.680]  And it just...
[40:32.680 --> 40:34.740]  It's a reaction to it.
[40:34.980 --> 40:36.180]  Fuck you.
[40:39.480 --> 40:39.980]  Um...
[40:39.980 --> 40:40.860]  It's
[40:40.860 --> 40:42.780]  great. What have you guys been up
[40:42.780 --> 40:43.520]  to recently?
[40:44.540 --> 40:46.180]  Geoff, it was your birthday yesterday.
[40:46.780 --> 40:48.440]  We recorded drafts.
[40:48.560 --> 40:50.400]  How are we feeling about the drafts?
[40:51.120 --> 40:52.700]  Uh... I feel like the second
[40:52.700 --> 40:53.740]  and the third were fucking amazing.
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.360]  I liked all of them.
[40:57.020 --> 40:58.720]  I'm excited to see the reaction
[40:58.720 --> 41:00.960]  to it. The last draft
[41:00.960 --> 41:03.000]  that we did. I think there's gonna
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.580]  be, uh...
[41:04.580 --> 41:06.780]  Some unhappy people. Should we name
[41:06.780 --> 41:09.140]  the drafts? I think it's a great idea.
[41:09.640 --> 41:11.360]  We had...
[41:11.360 --> 41:12.220]  Breakfast foods.
[41:12.820 --> 41:14.740]  That was the first one. Then we had
[41:14.740 --> 41:16.880]  TV show theme songs.
[41:17.660 --> 41:19.040]  Yes. Not sitcoms
[41:19.040 --> 41:20.360]  or any TV show theme song.
[41:20.620 --> 41:23.260]  Then we had...
[41:23.260 --> 41:24.640]  Non-alcoholic beverages.
[41:28.280 --> 41:28.840]  Which...
[41:28.840 --> 41:29.580]  I...
[41:30.820 --> 41:32.640]  I don't think people can predict
[41:32.640 --> 41:34.580]  the level of chaos that occurred.
[41:35.780 --> 41:37.200]  You wouldn't think...
[41:37.200 --> 41:38.640]  It was a big topic of
[41:38.640 --> 41:39.960]  discussion at dinner last night.
[41:40.100 --> 41:42.620]  You wouldn't have thought that non-alcoholic
[41:42.620 --> 41:44.620]  drinks was the most contentious
[41:44.620 --> 41:46.760]  of all of those. Divisive!
[41:47.640 --> 41:48.640]  Yeah, I wouldn't say
[41:48.640 --> 41:50.680]  contentious, but definitely divisive.
[41:51.660 --> 41:52.200]  Just...
[41:52.670 --> 41:53.460]  Interesting picks.
[41:54.180 --> 41:56.160]  And it's fucking Nick with his innocent
[41:56.160 --> 41:57.040]  over there.
[41:57.160 --> 41:59.700]  Like he's not most of the problem.
[42:00.140 --> 42:02.300]  Most of? All of?
[42:02.540 --> 42:03.180]  Either way.
[42:06.360 --> 42:08.140]  It's so much fun doing these games
[42:08.140 --> 42:09.900]  with you, because I don't think we've talked about
[42:09.900 --> 42:12.100]  on the podcast, but we did
[42:12.100 --> 42:14.240]  the Summer Movie League supplemental.
[42:14.540 --> 42:15.440]  Yeah, we did.
[42:15.900 --> 42:17.640]  Which is in full swing.
[42:18.720 --> 42:20.140]  And it has been so
[42:20.140 --> 42:22.080]  much fun seeing the community get
[42:22.080 --> 42:24.060]  behind it the way they have, and creating
[42:24.060 --> 42:25.940]  the tools that they've made
[42:25.940 --> 42:28.040]  for tracking stuff. Like there's
[42:28.040 --> 42:30.100]  a website you can go to that
[42:30.100 --> 42:32.420]  just keeps things updated. What's the standings?
[42:32.600 --> 42:33.340]  Yeah, you want to give an update?
[42:33.880 --> 42:35.940]  No, I don't. Someone should pull it up.
[42:35.980 --> 42:37.900]  I think Gavin is killing right now, right?
[42:38.480 --> 42:39.980]  Yeah, because you just had
[42:39.980 --> 42:41.900]  a big movie. I had 15 bucks for a while.
[42:42.800 --> 42:43.940]  Well, you had Bad Boys
[42:43.940 --> 42:45.500]  and Inside Out 2 back to back, I think.
[42:47.040 --> 42:47.980]  That's your whole summer
[42:47.980 --> 42:50.180]  right there. I mean, Bad Boys
[42:50.180 --> 42:51.980]  in my opinion, overperformed.
[42:51.980 --> 42:54.100]  I think it was a way bigger hit.
[42:54.340 --> 42:55.940]  I totally agree. I did not think that movie
[42:55.940 --> 42:57.940]  was going to do well. I mean, have either of you seen it?
[42:58.400 --> 43:00.120]  No. Well, how did it overperform?
[43:00.880 --> 43:02.140]  Because I read that
[43:02.140 --> 43:03.160]  it made a lot of money.
[43:04.500 --> 43:05.900]  And then it did well.
[43:07.720 --> 43:08.120]  Um...
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.120]  Got the stamp of approval by TPG.
[43:10.820 --> 43:12.060]  I asked him what his
[43:12.060 --> 43:13.780]  thoughts were, because I wouldn't even consider
[43:13.780 --> 43:15.800]  watching it unless he approved it.
[43:16.140 --> 43:17.480]  Said it's way better than 3.
[43:18.100 --> 43:19.160]  Well, 3 is
[43:19.160 --> 43:21.060]  3 was fuckin' pretty rough.
[43:21.240 --> 43:23.820]  So if it's better than 3, that's encouraging, I guess.
[43:24.180 --> 43:24.900]  Found the website.
[43:25.500 --> 43:27.140]  Currently, in
[43:27.140 --> 43:29.060]  first is Gavin
[43:29.060 --> 43:31.380]  Free with $326 million.
[43:32.180 --> 43:33.240]  Second place
[43:33.240 --> 43:34.380]  is myself
[43:34.910 --> 43:36.760]  with $104
[43:36.760 --> 43:38.760]  million, $900,000.
[43:39.140 --> 43:41.000]  Third place is Geoff
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.340]  $104 million,
[43:43.540 --> 43:44.520]  $100,000.
[43:45.180 --> 43:47.160]  Andrew, fourth place
[43:47.160 --> 43:48.080]  $94,000.
[43:48.740 --> 43:51.120]  Nick, fifth place
[43:51.120 --> 43:53.120]  almost there.
[43:53.400 --> 43:53.880]  Almost there.
[43:54.060 --> 43:56.480]  Andrew has $94 million.
[43:56.920 --> 43:59.360]  Nick, almost there, $13 million.
[43:59.600 --> 44:01.280]  So the difference between
[44:01.280 --> 44:03.140]  first to worst is
[44:04.900 --> 44:05.660]  $313
[44:05.660 --> 44:06.060]  million.
[44:06.800 --> 44:09.340]  But Nick doesn't have
[44:09.340 --> 44:11.260]  I think the only things that he's had
[44:11.260 --> 44:12.820]  that have come out so far are
[44:12.820 --> 44:15.180]  Sight and Back
[44:15.180 --> 44:16.880]  to Black, a movie that is
[44:16.880 --> 44:18.320]  no longer in theaters.
[44:18.840 --> 44:20.060]  They pulled it.
[44:21.440 --> 44:23.300]  But he has, in June
[44:23.300 --> 44:25.160]  late June, Nick has on the
[44:25.160 --> 44:27.060]  28th, Blue Lock, episode
[44:27.060 --> 44:29.540]  Nagi, and A Quiet Place
[44:29.540 --> 44:30.320]  Day One.
[44:30.740 --> 44:31.980]  Those are both on the 28th.
[44:33.020 --> 44:35.160]  And then, and then
[44:35.160 --> 44:37.040]  4th of July
[44:37.040 --> 44:39.000]  weekend, opening on
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.080]  July 3rd, Nick has
[44:41.080 --> 44:43.020]  Despicable Me 4.
[44:43.020 --> 44:45.100]  That's gonna make so much money.
[44:46.300 --> 44:46.760]  Rough.
[44:47.840 --> 44:49.160]  That's gonna be a pretty big movie
[44:49.160 --> 44:50.800]  for you. Make sure you check out our
[44:50.800 --> 44:52.320]  Summer Movie, what?
[44:53.000 --> 44:53.880]  Summer Movie Auction.
[44:54.380 --> 44:54.940]  Ah, sod it.
[44:58.040 --> 44:59.060]  Shut up, you idiot.
[44:59.080 --> 44:59.700]  You fucking idiot.
[45:02.460 --> 45:03.180]  Mush mouth
[45:03.180 --> 45:03.980]  boron.
[45:05.860 --> 45:06.780]  Fucking hell.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  But you can check it out as a supplemental
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.540]  on our YouTube channel,
[45:10.540 --> 45:12.660]  the Summer Movie Auction.
[45:13.060 --> 45:14.620]  It's so cool seeing these resources
[45:14.620 --> 45:16.800]  because this is a thing I did with my friends for years
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.440]  and it was just me
[45:18.440 --> 45:20.720]  checking Box Office Mojo every weekend
[45:20.720 --> 45:22.560]  going one at a time with a calculator.
[45:23.160 --> 45:24.400]  It's like seeing automated
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.100]  stuff. It's like, holy shit.
[45:26.300 --> 45:27.740]  People have figured it out. This is amazing.
[45:27.780 --> 45:31.020]  Why did I spend 11 points on Borderlands?
[45:31.660 --> 45:32.440]  I don't know.
[45:32.860 --> 45:34.620]  Because it's a video game property
[45:34.620 --> 45:36.420]  and it had Kevin Hart in it
[45:36.420 --> 45:37.220]  and you thought maybe.
[45:37.220 --> 45:39.280]  And Harold
[45:39.280 --> 45:40.660]  and the Purple Crown only spent three.
[45:41.480 --> 45:43.240]  Yeah, some of the prices are crazy.
[45:43.740 --> 45:44.900]  I think Horizon
[45:46.020 --> 45:46.900]  Kevin Costner's
[45:48.160 --> 45:49.040]  Western Fantasy
[45:49.040 --> 45:50.980]  comes out this weekend, right?
[45:51.040 --> 45:51.880]  Yes, it does.
[45:53.100 --> 45:55.720]  I think it's next week. It's the 28th.
[45:55.840 --> 45:56.000]  Okay.
[45:56.700 --> 45:59.460]  I guess by the time this is out, it will be coming out this weekend.
[46:00.040 --> 46:01.140]  Geoff spent 22
[46:01.140 --> 46:03.280]  points on it, but that's okay.
[46:04.520 --> 46:05.400]  Gavin spent
[46:05.400 --> 46:07.720]  six on chapter two.
[46:07.960 --> 46:09.460]  It comes out in August.
[46:10.140 --> 46:11.380]  Gavin doesn't have
[46:11.380 --> 46:13.360]  anything coming out between now
[46:13.360 --> 46:15.400]  and August 16th.
[46:15.400 --> 46:16.500]  I'm just chilling.
[46:18.680 --> 46:19.320]  Man,
[46:19.620 --> 46:21.520]  to further help
[46:21.520 --> 46:22.820]  myself win this contest,
[46:23.240 --> 46:25.360]  Millie and I on Father's Day went and
[46:25.360 --> 46:25.940]  saw If.
[46:26.740 --> 46:29.480]  Because that's where I've been making the bulk of my money.
[46:30.460 --> 46:31.560]  What a hunk
[46:31.560 --> 46:33.240]  of shit my movie If is.
[46:33.240 --> 46:34.480]  Oh my lord.
[46:34.860 --> 46:37.300]  How many more movies
[46:37.300 --> 46:38.540]  are we going to let Ryan Reynolds
[46:39.060 --> 46:39.800]  get away with?
[46:40.600 --> 46:43.140]  I think John Krasinski directed that film too.
[46:43.300 --> 46:44.140]  He created it.
[46:44.660 --> 46:46.640]  It is...
[46:46.980 --> 46:48.900]  It's a very well cast
[46:48.900 --> 46:51.100]  movie with a lot of really talented people.
[46:51.300 --> 46:53.400]  But man, is that story just a mess.
[46:53.920 --> 46:55.140]  Do you guys have
[46:55.140 --> 46:57.100]  celebrities or movie stars
[46:57.100 --> 46:59.080]  or whatever that for you walk
[46:59.080 --> 47:01.360]  a thin line where you're just going like
[47:01.360 --> 47:03.320]  you can't get many more chances
[47:03.320 --> 47:05.560]  like I'm keeping an eye
[47:05.560 --> 47:07.620]  on you. Do you have anyone like that?
[47:07.920 --> 47:09.760]  I felt that way about Russell Brand
[47:10.480 --> 47:11.560]  when he was in
[47:11.560 --> 47:13.380]  when Hollywood really tried to make
[47:13.380 --> 47:15.560]  Russell Brand a thing. From like
[47:15.560 --> 47:17.340]  forgetting Sarah Marshall to get him to the
[47:17.340 --> 47:19.380]  Greek. He was in like the
[47:19.380 --> 47:21.480]  Arthur remake. There were like three
[47:21.480 --> 47:23.340]  years where I didn't find him
[47:23.340 --> 47:25.120]  enjoyable in anything that he did.
[47:25.240 --> 47:27.400]  But he just kept getting huge
[47:27.400 --> 47:29.220]  movies. And I did not get it.
[47:29.220 --> 47:31.060]  I liked him in Sarah Marshall.
[47:31.760 --> 47:33.360]  That was like the one
[47:33.360 --> 47:35.080]  thing that he was like perfect for
[47:35.080 --> 47:37.400]  but then it was just that in everything
[47:37.400 --> 47:39.500]  he did. And it just didn't
[47:39.500 --> 47:40.320]  work the same.
[47:43.200 --> 47:45.040]  I feel that way about Jake
[47:45.040 --> 47:47.220]  Gyllenhaal. Really? That's a
[47:47.220 --> 47:49.140]  good one. That's a really good one.
[47:49.500 --> 47:51.260]  He had such a good run though.
[47:51.500 --> 47:52.880]  He did. He did.
[47:53.280 --> 47:55.440]  For a while. Yeah. But like
[47:55.440 --> 47:57.640]  remember when he was in Zodiac?
[47:57.640 --> 47:59.580]  And like that was
[47:59.580 --> 48:01.760]  at the same time when
[48:01.760 --> 48:03.720]  he was in Jarhead? Remember that movie?
[48:03.860 --> 48:05.480]  Jarhead? And like
[48:05.480 --> 48:07.620]  he was such a fucking piece of
[48:07.620 --> 48:09.500]  shit while making Zodiac
[48:09.500 --> 48:11.600]  because everyone kept telling him, dude, Jarhead is gonna be
[48:11.600 --> 48:13.520]  huge. And Jarhead was fucking nothing.
[48:13.880 --> 48:15.580]  And then he was like, oh yeah, I really
[48:15.580 --> 48:17.580]  did not try on Zodiac. And it's like
[48:17.580 --> 48:19.500]  why? It's like it could
[48:20.600 --> 48:21.700]  uh... what an
[48:21.700 --> 48:22.140]  asshole.
[48:26.300 --> 48:27.040]  Who else?
[48:27.880 --> 48:28.840]  I have it with
[48:28.840 --> 48:31.040]  Sidney Sweeney right now, which is
[48:31.040 --> 48:32.860]  such a bummer because I think she's cool
[48:32.860 --> 48:35.160]  but she can't keep getting away with it.
[48:35.340 --> 48:36.540]  She can't like she did
[48:36.540 --> 48:38.540]  she did Anyone But You
[48:38.540 --> 48:40.680]  and uh Madam Web
[48:40.680 --> 48:42.280]  and no one is like
[48:42.280 --> 48:44.520]  going after her. And then also
[48:44.520 --> 48:46.540]  the other half of Anyone But You, the other
[48:46.540 --> 48:48.720]  person who's on my fucking list is Glenn Powell.
[48:49.140 --> 48:50.940]  The guy who looks like a human capybara.
[48:51.400 --> 48:52.120]  Like he is
[48:53.720 --> 48:54.520]  That guy
[48:54.520 --> 48:56.600]  runs our wives podcast, man.
[48:56.860 --> 48:58.440]  Yes, and I can't
[48:58.440 --> 48:59.880]  oh man, like
[49:00.520 --> 49:02.420]  he's never gonna escape this tweet
[49:02.420 --> 49:04.440]  for me where somebody said he looks like
[49:04.440 --> 49:06.480]  a capybara who made a wish to become human.
[49:06.660 --> 49:09.020]  Like that is what Glenn Powell looks like.
[49:09.200 --> 49:10.440]  Did you see that thing where his
[49:10.440 --> 49:12.380]  parents held up the signs saying stop trying
[49:12.380 --> 49:14.220]  to make Glenn Powell happen? Glenn Powell's not gonna happen.
[49:15.040 --> 49:15.700]  That was really funny.
[49:16.080 --> 49:18.480]  At least he's aware of it. But I also think
[49:18.480 --> 49:20.480]  Dakota Johnson is on that list for me too.
[49:20.480 --> 49:22.580]  Ah, that's a great one, dude.
[49:22.840 --> 49:23.940]  A great one.
[49:24.360 --> 49:26.460]  If she wasn't Melanie Griffith
[49:26.460 --> 49:28.500]  and Don Johnson's kid, she would not
[49:28.500 --> 49:30.380]  be in movies anymore. Period.
[49:30.860 --> 49:32.480]  After fucking Fifty Shades
[49:32.480 --> 49:34.200]  of Grey, she was in Fifty Shades.
[49:34.340 --> 49:35.040]  That's crazy.
[49:35.860 --> 49:37.920]  And then Madame Web and
[49:37.920 --> 49:40.460]  I just don't, you know. She'll be in
[49:40.460 --> 49:42.380]  Hollywood for our entire lifetimes
[49:42.380 --> 49:43.920]  because of this or whatever.
[49:44.280 --> 49:46.060]  And I think she is very affable.
[49:46.200 --> 49:47.760]  As a person, I think she's affable.
[49:47.760 --> 49:49.820]  But I don't know her as a fucking
[49:49.820 --> 49:52.000]  person. I have to see her in the media
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.720]  and in movies and she can't keep
[49:53.720 --> 49:54.480]  getting away with it.
[49:55.540 --> 49:57.760]  Who is the opposite who they
[49:57.760 --> 49:59.700]  will forever have a pass with you
[49:59.700 --> 50:01.440]  no matter what because they're just so
[50:01.440 --> 50:02.880]  good on screen?
[50:03.600 --> 50:04.180]  Walton Goggins.
[50:06.700 --> 50:07.840]  That's a really good one.
[50:08.700 --> 50:09.780]  I feel like if ever I see
[50:09.780 --> 50:11.520]  Idris Elba in something, I want to watch it.
[50:11.660 --> 50:13.600]  Even though he's been in some real stinkers.
[50:14.860 --> 50:15.740]  Clancy Brown?
[50:16.380 --> 50:17.360]  That's a good one.
[50:18.980 --> 50:20.100]  Oh, I'm
[50:20.100 --> 50:21.660]  with Nick. Timothy Olyphant.
[50:21.980 --> 50:23.760]  I really like Timothy
[50:23.760 --> 50:25.420]  Olyphant a lot. I think he does
[50:25.420 --> 50:26.520]  good stuff.
[50:27.420 --> 50:29.740]  For me, it's...
[50:31.780 --> 50:32.340]  Dreamcatcher?
[50:32.840 --> 50:33.820]  Again, but
[50:33.820 --> 50:35.920]  that's why we're saying gets a pass
[50:35.920 --> 50:36.220]  baby.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.840]  For me, it's probably a little bit
[50:39.840 --> 50:41.320]  of an obvious pick but Denzel Washington.
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.200]  I will see anything with Denzel Washington.
[50:43.200 --> 50:45.020]  But I guess my less obvious pick
[50:45.020 --> 50:45.840]  would be Forrest Whitaker.
[50:46.460 --> 50:49.140]  I will forever trust Forrest Whitaker
[50:49.140 --> 50:50.240]  in anything I see of him.
[50:50.260 --> 50:51.600]  Even if it's that bad
[50:52.580 --> 50:53.960]  fucking accent in Rogue One.
[50:54.320 --> 50:55.560]  I'm still not holding it against him.
[50:58.080 --> 50:59.020]  Yeah, it's like
[50:59.020 --> 51:00.720]  actors that you rely on their
[51:00.720 --> 51:02.940]  performances, right? And not necessarily the movie.
[51:03.820 --> 51:04.960]  Absolutely. Forrest Whitaker
[51:04.960 --> 51:06.700]  is not to me a stamp of confidence
[51:06.700 --> 51:08.920]  that this will be a good movie, but I can
[51:08.920 --> 51:10.580]  rely on him to deliver.
[51:10.580 --> 51:12.580]  You know Forrest Whitaker will be good
[51:12.580 --> 51:14.000]  enough that the movie's worth it.
[51:14.080 --> 51:15.320]  Is how I feel about him.
[51:17.300 --> 51:17.720]  Bloodsport?
[51:21.260 --> 51:22.620]  Forgot that he was in that.
[51:23.160 --> 51:24.740]  By the way, Bloodsport's a great movie.
[51:25.200 --> 51:26.280]  Fucking awesome, I love it.
[51:26.320 --> 51:28.520]  It was one of the best movies of my childhood. Bloodsport and
[51:28.520 --> 51:30.860]  Kickboxer were fucking awesome.
[51:31.380 --> 51:32.380]  Like there was no kid
[51:32.380 --> 51:34.880]  on earth who didn't like those movies when they came out.
[51:35.140 --> 51:36.680]  Yeah, and also they're like the same
[51:36.680 --> 51:38.080]  movie. It's fucking awesome. It's great.
[51:38.080 --> 51:39.940]  Even better. You get to see the same movie twice.
[51:40.300 --> 51:42.440]  It's like watching the first four...
[51:42.440 --> 51:43.840]  Fuck, what's his name?
[51:44.960 --> 51:45.740]  Steven Seagal.
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.180]  It's like watching the first four Steven Seagal movies.
[51:48.480 --> 51:50.180]  Those movies are fucking amazing.
[51:50.820 --> 51:51.980]  It just sucks that he
[51:51.980 --> 51:53.540]  sucks. Marked for Death.
[51:53.840 --> 51:56.020]  Out for Justice. I don't remember
[51:56.020 --> 51:57.580]  the others. Those are fucking awesome.
[51:58.160 --> 51:59.520]  Under Siege? Hard to Kill.
[51:59.860 --> 52:00.820]  Was the other one? Yeah.
[52:02.040 --> 52:04.120]  Under Siege has Tommy Lee Jones looking all crazy.
[52:04.440 --> 52:06.220]  He does. And Gary Busey
[52:06.220 --> 52:08.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:08.900 --> 52:10.040]  Tommy Lee Jones. Hang on.
[52:10.300 --> 52:12.200]  Andrew, I gotta show you a picture of Tommy Lee Jones
[52:12.200 --> 52:14.420]  in this fucking movie because it's not what you expect.
[52:14.620 --> 52:15.000]  It's awesome.
[52:15.960 --> 52:17.740]  Tommy Lee Jones has...
[52:18.540 --> 52:20.040]  He has a line...
[52:20.920 --> 52:22.040]  He has a line in
[52:22.040 --> 52:24.080]  Under Siege about a revolution always
[52:24.080 --> 52:26.300]  coming back around in your face and I wrote it.
[52:26.460 --> 52:27.920]  I used it in like a sociology
[52:27.920 --> 52:30.080]  class in college and my professor
[52:30.080 --> 52:31.900]  was like, wow, that's incredible.
[52:32.020 --> 52:34.080]  That's so good. A movement stops
[52:34.080 --> 52:36.100]  but a revolution keeps coming back around
[52:36.100 --> 52:38.160]  and I'm like, yeah, fuck yeah. That's so
[52:38.160 --> 52:38.500]  cool.
[52:40.560 --> 52:42.160]  Yeah. I wouldn't watch
[52:42.160 --> 52:43.780]  anything Steven Seagal made after
[52:43.780 --> 52:46.200]  1991 or so, but from Under
[52:46.200 --> 52:48.060]  Siege back, the dude made good
[52:48.060 --> 52:50.080]  I mean, the dude sucks, don't get me wrong, but he made good
[52:50.080 --> 52:52.020]  movies. What's with his freaking
[52:52.020 --> 52:53.620]  arms? What?
[52:54.200 --> 52:56.120]  Like, they always like fling all about weird.
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.420]  Have you seen his running arms?
[52:58.240 --> 53:00.080]  He says that he
[53:00.080 --> 53:01.980]  has the perfect running form
[53:01.980 --> 53:04.040]  and that he can train Olympians to run
[53:04.040 --> 53:04.560]  faster.
[53:05.800 --> 53:08.000]  He's a big Anderson Silva
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.180]  trainer guy. Hang on.
[53:10.520 --> 53:11.980]  Hang on.
[53:12.920 --> 53:14.780]  Hang on. Hang on.
[53:15.780 --> 53:16.540]  Hang on.
[53:16.540 --> 53:18.240]  Okay, you guys
[53:18.240 --> 53:19.880]  ready? You watching my screen?
[53:20.280 --> 53:21.800]  Yeah. Alright, here we go.
[53:25.460 --> 53:26.540]  What was he
[53:26.540 --> 53:27.120]  doing with it?
[53:28.200 --> 53:29.920]  He almost has a ratty boy
[53:29.920 --> 53:31.960]  like stride. He does.
[53:32.120 --> 53:32.620]  He really does.
[53:33.100 --> 53:35.900]  The top half of his arms are like
[53:35.900 --> 53:37.880]  a different shape from the bottom half somehow.
[53:40.080 --> 53:41.740]  Have you seen that trend where
[53:41.740 --> 53:44.060]  people try to run same arm, same leg?
[53:44.200 --> 53:46.220]  It looks like he's doing that, but naturally.
[53:47.100 --> 53:47.800]  He's like
[53:47.800 --> 53:50.300]  knocking out everyone he goes...
[53:54.280 --> 53:55.620]  And I feel like...
[53:55.620 --> 53:57.480]  I feel like
[53:57.480 --> 53:59.020]  the directors knew
[53:59.020 --> 54:01.460]  and they deliberately always frame him so his arms
[54:01.460 --> 54:02.740]  are like front and center.
[54:03.300 --> 54:05.620]  I've heard a bunch of stories about directors
[54:05.620 --> 54:07.160]  working with Steven Seagal who have
[54:07.160 --> 54:09.440]  absolutely let him make an ass of himself
[54:09.440 --> 54:11.220]  on camera because they hated him so much.
[54:11.580 --> 54:13.740]  Or he was so hard to work with or so insufferable
[54:13.740 --> 54:14.940]  that they're like, that's great.
[54:15.920 --> 54:17.740]  Oh man, that's so...
[54:17.740 --> 54:19.340]  Gavin, holy shit.
[54:19.480 --> 54:20.320]  I've only seen
[54:21.320 --> 54:23.520]  above the law for those first
[54:23.520 --> 54:25.260]  few clips. I had no idea
[54:25.260 --> 54:26.520]  it was in so many of his movies.
[54:26.720 --> 54:29.380]  That's wonderful. The number one comment is
[54:29.380 --> 54:31.360]  what you're missing here is that he's
[54:31.360 --> 54:33.420]  throwing a recurring series of right hooks.
[54:33.540 --> 54:34.760]  He's not running through the air.
[54:34.820 --> 54:37.340]  He's punching it out of the way so he can
[54:37.340 --> 54:38.160]  run faster.
[54:40.220 --> 54:41.500]  He's getting rid of drag.
[54:45.340 --> 54:47.100]  Are you guys still watching? Are you at the part
[54:47.100 --> 54:49.200]  where he's on the gurney being led
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.060]  out of the hospital with the beard and the...
[54:51.060 --> 54:51.580]  Oh, that's awesome.
[54:53.280 --> 54:53.800]  Um...
[54:53.800 --> 54:55.540]  I want to see more
[54:55.540 --> 54:56.720]  Tommy Lee Jones looks.
[54:56.880 --> 54:59.600]  When I think of weird Tommy Lee Jones, I think of him
[54:59.600 --> 55:01.020]  and The Mechanic 2.
[55:02.060 --> 55:03.580]  Which is just insane.
[55:04.100 --> 55:05.440]  And I felt like that was his
[55:05.440 --> 55:07.480]  unique, insane role. I think
[55:07.480 --> 55:09.500]  I haven't explored enough of his catalog.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.700]  I think there's a lot of weird Tommy Lee
[55:11.700 --> 55:13.620]  Jones that I just don't know.
[55:14.200 --> 55:15.720]  I think he was a great actor.
[55:16.360 --> 55:17.380]  I think he was a great actor.
[55:17.880 --> 55:19.400]  A Jim Carrey interview
[55:19.400 --> 55:21.120]  I was listening to recently on TikTok
[55:21.120 --> 55:23.400]  where he was telling a story about working with him. I guess probably
[55:23.400 --> 55:25.040]  on Batman. And he
[55:25.040 --> 55:27.120]  went up to him at a
[55:27.120 --> 55:29.420]  I'm going to butcher the story because I don't remember very well
[55:29.420 --> 55:31.180]  but he went up to him at a diner or something and he
[55:31.180 --> 55:33.240]  just went to stop and have a conversation
[55:33.240 --> 55:34.640]  with him. I think it was Jim Carrey
[55:34.640 --> 55:37.500]  and Tommy Lee Jones was like, listen, I don't like you.
[55:37.660 --> 55:39.300]  I don't want to talk to you. It was when they were working on Batman.
[55:39.820 --> 55:40.180]  Yeah.
[55:40.740 --> 55:43.140]  And he said, I won't condone your buffoonery.
[55:43.680 --> 55:44.320]  That's what it was.
[55:45.040 --> 55:46.740]  That was their relationship.
[55:46.740 --> 55:47.440]  He's like, okay.
[55:49.320 --> 55:50.720]  He just doesn't...
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.780]  I can't imagine Tommy Lee
[55:52.780 --> 55:54.500]  Jones having like a belly laugh.
[55:54.780 --> 55:56.900]  Like have it like a deep, genuine
[55:56.900 --> 55:57.440]  laugh.
[55:58.740 --> 56:00.660]  He seems so stoic to me and grumpy
[56:00.660 --> 56:02.500]  all the time, which I know is sort of his
[56:02.500 --> 56:04.720]  thing. It's what he leans into.
[56:05.640 --> 56:06.400]  Benicio Del Toro.
[56:06.820 --> 56:08.900]  Another one. An actor where it's just
[56:08.900 --> 56:09.720]  always great.
[56:10.460 --> 56:11.660]  Big Benicio Del Toro guy.
[56:12.260 --> 56:14.280]  Absolutely. But you could
[56:14.280 --> 56:15.380]  maybe have your
[56:16.060 --> 56:17.980]  opinions changed, Eric, with
[56:17.980 --> 56:19.960]  Twisters coming out this summer.
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.060]  That movie looks
[56:22.060 --> 56:22.800]  terrible.
[56:24.180 --> 56:25.220]  You're nuts.
[56:26.140 --> 56:27.160]  It's gonna be crazy.
[56:28.240 --> 56:30.200]  My wife is so fucking excited to
[56:30.200 --> 56:31.240]  see that movie. Really?
[56:32.080 --> 56:33.380]  Why? Just watch Twister.
[56:33.960 --> 56:35.520]  She loved it. She wants to see the new one.
[56:36.460 --> 56:37.720]  It's got Glenn Powell in it. You know
[56:37.720 --> 56:39.500]  how our wives are about Glenn Powell.
[56:39.900 --> 56:41.860]  But particularly
[56:41.860 --> 56:43.540]  your wife
[56:43.540 --> 56:45.420]  loves it. Loves Glenn Powell.
[56:45.920 --> 56:46.660]  What are you gonna do?
[56:47.160 --> 56:49.880]  I'm incredibly against the
[56:49.880 --> 56:51.860]  use of AI for movies. I feel like it's
[56:51.860 --> 56:53.660]  weird in general in a lot of ways.
[56:54.040 --> 56:54.580]  It's not great.
[56:55.440 --> 56:57.440]  I think I'd give a pass if they brought back
[56:57.440 --> 56:59.960]  Philip Seymour Hoffman for Twisters just as an AI.
[57:00.300 --> 57:01.860]  As dusty. Just having
[57:01.860 --> 57:03.820]  him walking around yelling about
[57:03.820 --> 57:05.700]  the extreme would make me
[57:05.700 --> 57:06.540]  so happy.
[57:08.240 --> 57:09.340]  It's another actor.
[57:09.340 --> 57:11.340]  Philip Seymour Hoffman is so fucking good.
[57:11.940 --> 57:12.800]  Everything he's in.
[57:13.440 --> 57:14.840]  Have they done that yet?
[57:15.040 --> 57:17.200]  I know they did it on The Sopranos
[57:17.200 --> 57:19.120]  with Tony's mom when she died
[57:19.540 --> 57:20.700]  before they could record her.
[57:21.700 --> 57:23.200]  And it looked like dog shit because it was
[57:23.200 --> 57:25.160]  20 years ago. But have they done that
[57:25.160 --> 57:27.380]  recently where they took a deceased person
[57:27.380 --> 57:28.940]  and inserted them into a film?
[57:28.960 --> 57:30.000]  They did Tarkin, didn't they?
[57:31.540 --> 57:33.040]  Great, Grandma Tarkin. That's it.
[57:33.600 --> 57:34.260]  They did it with him?
[57:34.540 --> 57:36.780]  They already did it with
[57:36.780 --> 57:38.840]  Philip Seymour Hoffman in the last
[57:38.840 --> 57:40.480]  Hunger Games. There's a lot of CG
[57:40.480 --> 57:41.840]  Philip Seymour Hoffman in that.
[57:42.180 --> 57:44.420]  Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.
[57:44.520 --> 57:46.540]  Didn't they do that with Carrie Fisher
[57:46.540 --> 57:47.260]  after she died?
[57:48.440 --> 57:49.320]  Did they?
[57:50.140 --> 57:52.900]  Isn't she in space fucking freezing or whatever?
[57:53.520 --> 57:55.100]  Well, she's at the end of Rogue One
[57:55.100 --> 57:56.540]  as CG, I think.
[57:56.620 --> 57:58.880]  Oh, they de-aged her? I don't know if she was already dead.
[57:59.960 --> 58:00.540]  I think she was.
[58:01.460 --> 58:02.680]  There's so much
[58:02.680 --> 58:03.680]  de-aging going on.
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.520]  I don't get it.
[58:07.620 --> 58:08.180]  I don't get it.
[58:08.180 --> 58:09.500]  The teeth thing and
[58:09.500 --> 58:11.160]  forehead wrinkles are fine.
[58:11.380 --> 58:13.720]  I don't understand why we're trying to
[58:13.720 --> 58:15.760]  combat teeth and forehead wrinkles.
[58:15.980 --> 58:17.400]  Let your face scrunch, it's fine.
[58:18.140 --> 58:19.180]  I think it's more like
[58:19.180 --> 58:21.460]  in flashback scenes in Marvel movies
[58:21.460 --> 58:23.320]  when they make Michael Douglas Young
[58:23.320 --> 58:24.400]  in Ant-Man or something.
[58:25.160 --> 58:27.740]  I feel like it's just such a waste of time.
[58:27.880 --> 58:29.720]  In Furiosa, they start to...
[58:30.580 --> 58:31.380]  Well, it looked like they were
[58:31.380 --> 58:33.220]  merging the child actor's
[58:33.220 --> 58:35.840]  face with Anya Taylor-Joy
[58:36.620 --> 58:37.060]  as
[58:37.060 --> 58:39.460]  time went on to get them to look closer together.
[58:39.620 --> 58:41.480]  But I feel like the whole world has learned
[58:41.480 --> 58:43.400]  to suspend disbelief when it comes
[58:43.400 --> 58:45.160]  to two actresses
[58:45.160 --> 58:47.420]  or actors playing the same character at different
[58:47.420 --> 58:49.580]  times in the same movie. Like, we understand it.
[58:49.680 --> 58:51.440]  They're going to look different, and then it will cut to the next
[58:51.440 --> 58:53.320]  actor. I don't know why we have to merge
[58:53.320 --> 58:55.620]  their heads together. It looks just...
[58:55.620 --> 58:56.760]  It looks way worse!
[58:57.420 --> 58:58.600]  Dude. Distracting.
[58:59.400 --> 59:00.280]  Speaking of
[59:01.640 --> 59:02.600]  some of the
[59:02.600 --> 59:04.380]  handles that really well. Have you guys ever watched
[59:04.380 --> 59:05.460]  Our Flag Means Death?
[59:06.320 --> 59:08.680]  No. There's a character in that show
[59:08.680 --> 59:10.540]  called Jim. It's a woman who's
[59:10.540 --> 59:12.300]  pretending to be a man, and you don't know it
[59:12.300 --> 59:14.740]  at first. So in the first two episodes,
[59:14.840 --> 59:16.640]  the character is played by a dude.
[59:16.900 --> 59:18.640]  And then when they pull the mustache off,
[59:18.680 --> 59:20.540]  it just becomes this woman. And then she's the character
[59:20.540 --> 59:22.780]  for the rest of the time. It's so fucking funny.
[59:22.800 --> 59:24.600]  And I wish more shows would do that.
[59:25.180 --> 59:26.460]  It makes it...
[59:26.460 --> 59:28.340]  It makes such a point of making it funny
[59:28.340 --> 59:29.980]  that it's delightful.
[59:31.280 --> 59:32.080]  That's awesome.
[59:32.800 --> 59:34.620]  I decided I'm going to write a short story
[59:35.260 --> 59:35.760]  but
[59:36.460 --> 59:38.600]  exclusively in the signature boxes
[59:38.600 --> 59:40.080]  of iPads
[59:40.080 --> 59:42.520]  at checkouts. I'm going to write it one word
[59:42.520 --> 59:42.960]  at a time.
[59:44.260 --> 59:46.360]  And hope that it ends up
[59:46.360 --> 59:46.760]  somewhere.
[59:48.120 --> 59:50.120]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[59:50.600 --> 59:52.280]  You know when you sign for your
[59:52.280 --> 59:53.280]  credit card or whatever?
[59:53.280 --> 59:55.280]  You want your signing stuff
[59:55.280 --> 59:57.340]  to get, like, hacked? Or how would it end
[59:57.340 --> 59:58.840]  up somewhere? What do you mean by that?
[59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.120]  Where does my signature go?
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.240]  I assume to the
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.460]  business and then the bank?
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.380]  So the bank will have
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.380]  my story. I don't know.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.100]  Are you pitching
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.280]  payday DLC right now? We gotta go rob
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.940]  a bank to get your narrative?
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.720]  I'm gonna open up
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.240]  all the safety deposit boxes
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.600]  word by word.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.240]  I wonder how much money and how long it would
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.640]  take for me to finish my story.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.040]  Well, okay.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.280]  You have something there. Are you
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.200]  gonna write the story ahead of time and then
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.080]  publish it that way? Or are you
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.300]  creating it in the moment as
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.040]  you're checking out? It would suck to have
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.140]  writer's block on a fucking Monday
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.220]  at the grocery store. With like six
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.040]  people behind me.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.520]  I think I could do it on the fly.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.240]  And just keep a
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.240]  mental note of where
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.260]  the story's going. I think it would be cheating to pre-write
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.100]  the story. How many
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.820]  words do you think this story will be?
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:58.520]  I mean, how
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.200]  many pages is a good short story?
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.320]  Yeah, twenty thousand words, probably.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.260]  For like a...
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.380]  Probably
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.360]  for a good short story, probably at least a thousand words.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.420]  Okay, let's say a thousand words.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.180]  So I have to buy a thousand
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:13.880]  things.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.140]  I think the
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.360]  beginning will be easy, though.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.060]  Once.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:22.640]  That's my
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.380]  first word going in.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.380]  That's how you're going to start it?
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.560]  Does the item in some way have to relate
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.100]  to the word?
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.180]  What do you mean?
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.560]  For you to be able to use a word, does it have to
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.580]  maybe be
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.300]  somehow incorporated to the product
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.100]  in some way? Or that you can make the word out of it?
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.320]  Well, no, because then the whole story would be about groceries.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.000]  What if?
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.540]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.700]  Maybe this is a separate idea.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.680]  But what if you had to write a short
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.540]  story like that, but you could only use
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.600]  words you found in the grocery store on
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.540]  products. And then you had to buy
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.320]  that product. So if you wanted to use the word
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.520]  fabulous, you had to go track down
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.580]  something that says fabulous on it and then buy it.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.660]  You have to buy your
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.880]  words for your short story.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.660]  I think it's a difficult enough handicap as it is.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.960]  It would be impossible.
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:15.640]  Beans!
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.230]  She exclaimed.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.520]  How about this?
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.700]  How about as a test, we each
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.840]  buy like three items
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.660]  and then have to
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.300]  write a story
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.900]  based off of words that are on that product.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.500]  As a test.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:35.520]  I like that.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.760]  So wait, we're buying
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.340]  three things and we're putting in three words?
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.560]  No, well, sure, we could do three words
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.940]  or it could be as long as you want.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.460]  For example, I have an empty bottle of
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.400]  coke in front of me.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.380]  Naturally is on the bottle. I can have
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.460]  natural. I now have natural in my reserve.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.440]  I got flavored. I got cola.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:55.940]  I got Quebec.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.480]  How would you start
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.520]  your story with these words?
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.360]  Naturally.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:02.640]  Naturally.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:06.340]  Naturally Quebec.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.440]  Yeah, it's like naturally Quebec.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.800]  Quebec is caffeine free
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.120]  and provides
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.620]  17% of the daily recommended
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.520]  niacin or whatever it is.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:19.800]  Phosphoric.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.060]  Quebec.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.460]  Any word on
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:26.380]  the can or on the product should be fine, right?
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.200]  Absolutely.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.100]  So they'll have like printed
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.320]  or like, you know, packaged in
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.360]  Illinois and then you have the word in
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:34.740]  right there.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.660]  I'm trying to think. I like
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.480]  the idea of buying something.
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.160]  Ooh, the word. I get the word.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.620]  I really wanted a spaghetti
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.740]  subplot and now...
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.780]  I love this because
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.640]  Gavin had an idea to do this
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.760]  at checkout and now I can tell by the way
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.280]  he's not saying anything.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.640]  He's not on board with whatever this
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.500]  new idea is.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.720]  I feel like we can potentially tackle
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.560]  it from different angles.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.420]  Well, I think they're two different
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.800]  ideas. Yeah.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.060]  But I don't want to
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.480]  spot a word that I needed on a can
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.380]  of like pickles. I'm never going to eat the
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.160]  damn things. What about SpaghettiOs?
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.820]  Well, that's up to you. You're the writer.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.200]  Are SpaghettiOs
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.120]  disqualified? I guess it
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.100]  has to be what's on the can, right?
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.840]  Not what's in the food.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.960]  Because you just unlocked the dictionary.
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.180]  If the SpaghettiOs spell
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.340]  a word on a spoon in a picture
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.920]  on the can, you get that one.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.960]  This is so specific.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.160]  So it just spells ooooooo.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.380]  Alright. If that's what it
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.420]  spells, you can do it. But if it spells yum,
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.540]  you got yum.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.820]  That's a word. It's on the can.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.480]  I don't want
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.540]  to dissuade you, Gavin, from doing
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.500]  your short story idea in the
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.360]  signature line because
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.300]  I think that's fun and brilliant and I think
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.000]  you should do it.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.120]  I think this is a totally separate idea
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.080]  and I like Andrew's idea of just go to the store
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.480]  we buy three things that have a lot of words on them.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.240]  And it just makes three things
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.220]  that you need. It's up to you to be clever with
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.400]  what to do with the words, right?
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.060]  It could even be a thing where we have to guess
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.080]  what the product is after seeing what we
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.280]  create out of the thing.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.820]  That's fucking brilliant, dude.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.300]  If you can guess the three items?
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.440]  Dude.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.000]  So let's say I have a bottle of
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.180]  Coca-Cola, right, Gavin? But I don't want you to know
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:25.140]  it's Coca-Cola, so I just use
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.780]  naturally in Quebec from it.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:29.060]  You're never gonna necessarily guess that
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.860]  I sourced that from a bottle of Coke.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.760]  So like
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.120]  you have to try to both
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.120]  convey a story or a sentence
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.020]  that is coherent while
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.400]  also trying to not expose
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.100]  what your item is, I guess, and then we
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.240]  can reveal what we bought.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.440]  Alright, I'll try that too.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.260]  We'll do this... can everybody have it
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.660]  ready by next week? For the next episode?
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:51.640]  Yeah. Sure.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.700]  My hope overall
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.720]  with the short story and the signature box
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.780]  is that if I was to request all my data
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.740]  from the bank, I would just
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.820]  see like hundreds and hundreds
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.780]  of my signature, and then all of a
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.180]  sudden, a story starts.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.960]  That would be great. Can you do that?
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.480]  Can you request that information from the bank?
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.460]  I was gonna say, I don't know if...
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.620]  Absolutely no idea. I'm not even convinced that goes
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.640]  anywhere. I'm not convinced
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.660]  that you just write gibberish and then it's
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.700]  gone forever. You bring up a great point,
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.740]  Gavin, where I have never, and maybe this is
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.720]  just me being lucky, I've never been in
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.780]  a scenario in which I've been asked to
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.580]  verify any of my signatures
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.580]  ever. Completely pointless. I grew up
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.740]  with pin codes and stuff. Coming here with
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.920]  signing for stuff that no one ever checks.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.660]  There's nothing even written on the back of my card.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.840]  I don't know what it's for. I don't know who it's for.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.400]  Dude, it's the...
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.760]  It's Forbes. It's the same thing
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.700]  with forums. I went to the doctor this morning and filled out
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.720]  the same forum I fill out every time I go
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.340]  there with the same information,
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.240]  that then they look at the forum and they
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.440]  ask me the questions on the forum and then I give
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.220]  them the same information verbally and then I
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.280]  know as soon as I leave that forum gets thrown the
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.520]  fuck away because why are they keeping it? It's useless.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.520]  It's like when you do a support chat on a website,
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.520]  you have to sometimes fill out a brief
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.220]  form before you can talk to the agent
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.360]  and they ask you the same goddamn shit
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.340]  I just typed. Yeah, never.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.500]  And you could even say,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.260]  I already typed it, and then they go and get it.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.560]  It's like, why are you asking me that?
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.480]  Yeah. Pissing me off.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.500]  I'm with you. I never thought
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.640]  about that. Where are my signatures going?
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.120]  Who is this helping?
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.580]  So Canada still does signatures too?
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.500]  Uh, for certain things,
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.620]  yeah. There are times in which I have to sign for stuff.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.740]  Madness. It is.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.740]  Would you consider taking a photo
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.600]  each time you do it so you could have a
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.540]  record yourself? Ooh,
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.500]  that's a good idea. Or is that too weird to take a
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.540]  photo of a... No, I think that's
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.280]  fine. I feel fine with that.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.380]  What if this is how Gavin
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.560]  realized there's fraudulent activity on his account?
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.480]  I never... Listen,
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.120]  I did not have... I didn't write that sentence!
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.480]  Yeah, there was not a leprechaun in the
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:51.840]  story.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.020]  What?
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.980]  That was like a two-year period
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.340]  when I first moved here, because I was still laughing at the whole
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.280]  signature thing, where I would just draw a small
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.100]  picture of a house every time for my signature.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.520]  I drew WizKid one time.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.680]  Here's WizKid from...
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.340]  How long did you spend on that?
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.120]  It was a little while.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.040]  I thought WizPig would be a pretty cool signature
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:18.880]  for a second.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.540]  When you get through the 13th
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.360]  little line that you gotta draw for
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.280]  his head and for his teeth, you just kinda go,
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.400]  I don't wanna do this anymore.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.280]  I just love the idea of that being stored
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.260]  on some server somewhere. On a
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:34.180]  bank. Or the
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.160]  servers of the place you typed that.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.260]  I think WizPig
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.100]  is somewhere saying, I didn't buy
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.820]  this. What?
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.240]  Like they track him down because it's his
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:44.460]  face.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.160]  I wish to God, now that we're having the
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.260]  discussion, I wish it went somewhere
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.420]  and that it was findable
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.220]  by someone, someday. But I
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.340]  really don't think so.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.280]  I don't think anybody ever looks at it, ever.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:08:59.700]  Ever.
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.560]  You could admit to...
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.200]  Gavin, you could
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.880]  admit to committing a murder
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.000]  one word at a time on those
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.040]  things and no one would ever catch
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:10.940]  you or find out.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.020]  Can you imagine wanting
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:15.960]  to enter some place and them saying, okay
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.940]  wait a second, we need you to sign your
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.920]  signature and they're holding up one of your old
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.640]  ones to verify it matches?
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.320]  What is the value?
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.980]  It's madness. I'm imagining it like that in the Mr.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.800]  Bean movie where they hold up his passport
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.080]  next to his face and he has to make the same face
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:30.800]  on his passport.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.080]  Oh man.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:36.580]  I never
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.180]  thought about signatures in that way.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.100]  I never questioned them.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.880]  What a pointless system.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:42.960]  Yeah.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.540]  Most of the time when you're filling out anything
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.580]  or using a pen or typing stuff
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.760]  in, it's useless.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.120]  I feel like in 2024.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.720]  Like all these things are just designed to slow
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.820]  it's just
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.620]  to slow us down.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.360]  Gavin just posted a photo
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.080]  of the Mr. Bean face. That is
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:02.700]  great.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.760]  You had a lot to pick from.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:10.540]  I know.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.140]  I think I'm still going with the creepy fucking Ian
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.360]  The creepy Ian is
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.540]  just hideous.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.200]  Maybe we put it to the audience on what to name
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.700]  Ian's evil twin.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.920]  Ian's evil twin.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.340]  Oh.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.240]  Yeah.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.060]  What would be a good name for an evil twin named Ian?
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.760]  You can't do like the backwards name thing.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:33.240]  Tween.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.920]  The audience will come up with something
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.560]  better than we did.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.020]  Oh man.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.540]  I'm excited.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.680]  Hi, I'm Ian. Here's my twin Tween.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.340]  He's the evil one.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.160]  You know how it is.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.600]  We have very different signatures, just so you know.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.360]  I want to
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.920]  pitch something to Eric.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.460]  Oh.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:59.080]  I found out something about Eric.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.580]  You found out something about
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.740]  Eric? Yeah.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.020]  I found out
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.480]  that
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.760]  you don't
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.900]  like being squeezed
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.560]  by the blood pressure
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.540]  inflatables. Have I never talked
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.740]  about that? No.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.280]  I don't have
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.060]  a fear of needles
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.080]  and I'll get
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.420]  surgery. None of that
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.440]  bothers me or whatever. When I get
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.280]  my blood pressure taken, I
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.440]  tell them beforehand. It's the thing where it goes
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.360]  around your bicep and then it's
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.800]  squeezed to
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.920]  get your blood pressure.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.340]  Before they do it, I tell them
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:41.440]  hey, you're about to get a reading
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.240]  that you're going to look at and be like, oh, that's a little
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.340]  high. It's not high
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.440]  blood pressure. These things, I
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.420]  hate so
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.380]  desperately and like wish
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:53.520]  that you never had to do this.
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.720]  It makes me so anxious.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.520]  Yes. It makes me so
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.860]  anxious it makes my heart race.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.360]  I hate them. So I want to pitch
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.080]  to you. I get like 10 of them
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.380]  and we put them all over you and
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:07.380]  inflate them all at the same time. Oh, like
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.560]  immersion therapy. We get like an average
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.120]  reading across all your limbs.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.260]  Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I mean, I mean, we're not
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.320]  going to do that. So, I mean, you can keep pitching
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.200]  it as far as you want to. Yeah. Hey,
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.440]  hey, Geoff, we're going to put you in a bucket full of snakes.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.900]  Like, what are you talking about?
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.340]  Oh, is this like a
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.280]  snake level thing for you? Yeah,
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.380]  I hate it. So it's like an actual phobia.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.260]  I can't, I can't
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.280]  look at it while they do it. I
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.320]  have to like, I tense
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.340]  up and won't move while it's on me.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.300]  I hate it. Could you, could you watch it
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.400]  get done to me? Yeah, it doesn't bother
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.680]  me for other people. I just know how it makes me feel.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.140]  If we put like 10 on me. Yeah,
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.080]  it doesn't matter. I don't give a shit. Yeah, let's put
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.980]  10 on you. I don't care. Let's put 10 on you and
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.880]  put you in a bucket of snakes. I don't give a shit.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.160]  Yeah. In the
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.580]  interest of never doing a
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.320]  Geoff is scared of snakes bit,
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.240]  I'm full support of you here, Eric.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.920]  Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.140]  Does that have like a history
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.020]  for you? No, I don't know.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.280]  It's just a thing. I don't like
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.240]  when I can feel my heart beat like in my
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.840]  hand. Like that's,
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.160]  you know what I mean? Like when you can like feel your pulse
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.780]  like that. That makes you alive.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.300]  Yes, and it makes me want to curl up and die.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.140]  So I don't like it.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.700]  I hate it.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.200]  Okay, what if we put
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.240]  10 on you, right? No. They're still
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.360]  loose. You said all right. We didn't
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.860]  get that far. The answer's no.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.100]  At this point, they're just like
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.840]  Velcro fabrics. Loose.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.100]  Nice and loose. And then
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.100]  I'll just squeeze one
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.660]  puff of air into each one.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.180]  No. I don't understand.
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:40.960]  I don't know. Okay.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.480]  You said all right, and I said no.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.100]  Let's step back for a moment.
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.460]  I still don't know what the goal is for what you're doing.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.540]  I thought I'd be able to get further.
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.880]  I just want to see if his head goes all red.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.300]  Oh, okay. You wouldn't need
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.700]  to put 10 on me.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.960]  You could put one on me.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.040]  Like, yeah,
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.360]  you don't need that.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.360]  What if we make a giant
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.340]  slice of bread, and Gavin, you can lay
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.440]  on top of it and slowly lower
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.460]  it into a pool.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.880]  Like, what are we talking about?
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.380]  Just imagine the bread is like a pool
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.440]  float, and you ride it into the water.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.380]  All right, that's not funny, guys.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.340]  What if, like, French loaves were pool noodles?
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.360]  If I was next to
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.200]  Eric, watching him get all puffed up,
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.400]  and I was slowly getting lowered into a wet
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.280]  bread pool, I'd be there for support.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:35.900]  I would do it.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.080]  That's happening at the same time
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.920]  Geoff is rolling around in a pile of snakes?
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.360]  The snakes are gonna kill
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.200]  me. Nothing you guys are doing is gonna
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.180]  harm you. Nick, what are you most scared of
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:47.900]  that we can exploit?
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.340]  I don't like
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.120]  needles a lot right now. Or
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:53.640]  blood draws.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.180]  I had a rough blood draw
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:57.480]  today.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.320]  You brought some stuff flooding back.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.020]  Sorry about that.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.080]  Wait, hang on.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.260]  How did you learn
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.440]  this about me, Gavin?
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.120]  How did you learn this about me?
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.960]  The most
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:13.900]  bullshit
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.140]  I've ever
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.680]  heard in my
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.700]  life!
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:20.760]  Everybody!
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.400]  What the fuck is this?
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.380]  I'm not saying
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.300]  that we should do this. Just in my head, it's
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.260]  very funny. The idea of
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.380]  all of us sitting in a row
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.400]  with our triggers in front of us
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.440]  that seem ridiculous
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.160]  and just fainting
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.100]  and passing out, stressed out.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.380]  It's like, Garrett getting
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.280]  his blood pressure done, Gavin's
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.580]  puking with wet bread.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.300]  I'm fainting seeing a surgery scene
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:50.940]  in a movie.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.220]  It isn't actually impacting
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.940]  us, but completely destroying us.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.740]  I feel like everyone's passing out.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.580]  Except I'm just gonna be throwing up.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.760]  All that's gonna happen to me
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.720]  is I'm gonna vomit everything out, and then I'll just
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.460]  be hanging there.
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.560]  Go subscribe to our Patreon
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.540]  while I really get to the bottom of where the fuck
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.860]  Gavin learned this about me. What the fuck happened?
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.820]  I can't find out.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.720]  Do you have a lot
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.860]  of stuff, Gavin? Do you have any others?
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.660]  Can we do one a week?
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.820]  At this point, I'm gonna keep my source
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:24.420]  private.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.620]  So I can
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.420]  get more information out of it, potentially.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.580]  Have you been releasing it,
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.520]  Eric, word by word, on
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.560]  the signatures? When you text
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.600]  Alyssa about Left 4 Dead 2,
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.420]  can you just let her know to stop giving you
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.820]  secrets about me? Thank you.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.040]  This sucks.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.420]  I can't believe that.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.540]  It would just be the only person that my wife talks
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.880]  to about this stuff. It's terrible.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.420]  By the way, I was kinda disappointed that we don't
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.060]  really have a good URL to
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.600]  push people to other than
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.120]  Patreon slash RegulationPod.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:57.860]  It's a bit of a mouthful, so I was hoping we had
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.280]  a much shorter URL.
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:02.120]  We don't. Someone else took all those.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.620]  So I registered
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.480]  Regulatreon.com
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.520]  You did it.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.840]  And it forwards to our Patreon.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.120]  Wait, it's what?
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.720]  Regulatreon.com
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.920]  How do you spell that?
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.100]  The way it sounds, probably.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.300]  R-E-G-U-L-A-T-R-I
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.220]  There it is.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.100]  So go to Regulatreon.com
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.000]  Insane.
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:31.500]  Regulatreon
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.180]  Much harder to remember or spell
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.780]  than just going to Patreon.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.360]  But I felt like it was worth it.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.100]  Hey, the link works. It's good.
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.680]  Oh, I put it in the show notes
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.420]  so you guys can go scroll down
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.380]  and check out

[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.700]  It's about as offensive as I thought it'd be.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.460]  Yep, uh-huh.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.860]  Well, thanks for listening.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.860]  Go to Regulatreon.com

[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.400]  This was episode 7 of the Regulation Podcast.

[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:09.240]  Bye!
