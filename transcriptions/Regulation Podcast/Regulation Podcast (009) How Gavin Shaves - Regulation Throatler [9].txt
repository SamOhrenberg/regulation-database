[00:00.000 --> 00:03.800]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:04.100 --> 00:08.840]  My name is Geoff Ramsey and with me, as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Pantin,
[00:08.980 --> 00:12.700]  Eric Baudour, Nick Schwartz. Episode nine. Go.
[00:13.200 --> 00:16.220]  How do you shave without clogging a sink?
[00:17.740 --> 00:19.180]  Don't. Oh, actually.
[00:20.540 --> 00:24.300]  I mean, the answer I have is is is not far off from your answers.
[00:24.400 --> 00:25.000]  I shave outside.
[00:25.960 --> 00:28.060]  If I have to shave my beard off or something.
[00:28.060 --> 00:32.120]  Eric saw my outdoor shaving set up and he finds it repulsive.
[00:32.320 --> 00:35.120]  I want to post a picture here.
[00:35.830 --> 00:38.240]  It maybe isn't for public consumption,
[00:39.300 --> 00:43.660]  just based on like your twisted
[00:43.660 --> 00:48.660]  fucking set, like this saw looking ass set up that you have for like.
[00:50.240 --> 00:52.600]  Here's the first image.
[00:53.320 --> 00:55.540]  This is this is where Gavin shaves.
[00:55.540 --> 00:59.400]  What? So you're looking at that and you're like,
[00:59.540 --> 01:04.120]  oh, this is just in the middle of it truly is just in the middle of.
[01:04.220 --> 01:08.620]  There's the second image just under a box
[01:08.620 --> 01:12.480]  on the side of his house near two pieces of a broken mirror.
[01:12.660 --> 01:13.520]  Andrew, thoughts?
[01:13.920 --> 01:15.660]  I think it's fine. Who cares?
[01:17.300 --> 01:19.260]  It's his fucking backyard.
[01:19.940 --> 01:22.780]  If he's standing in a bathroom at a mirror.
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.140]  I mean, there's a mirror out there. What do you want from him?
[01:25.140 --> 01:26.320]  It's fine. That's so interesting.
[01:26.440 --> 01:27.820]  You know, no, no. Here's the thing.
[01:27.960 --> 01:29.460]  That's a that's a great question, Nick.
[01:29.600 --> 01:32.540]  Nick asks such a good question.
[01:32.740 --> 01:35.420]  Do you use the mirror? Do you crouch down?
[01:35.560 --> 01:39.080]  Well, Gavin, do you have any images you want to drop into this chat
[01:39.080 --> 01:40.760]  so that way people can see?
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.160]  You don't even necessarily need to crouch down.
[01:43.640 --> 01:44.860]  Like a monkey man?
[01:45.220 --> 01:47.520]  You have. Oh, you that now that.
[01:48.960 --> 01:50.780]  Yeah. OK, that
[01:51.560 --> 01:53.280]  I lost a little bit of my.
[01:54.280 --> 01:55.860]  What do you mean I've lost you?
[01:56.240 --> 01:57.420]  How else am I going to see in the mirror?
[02:01.160 --> 02:05.640]  For the audience that can't see this, because I doubt these images will come out.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.680]  Gavin is in a squat as if he's taking a shit on the ground,
[02:10.180 --> 02:14.160]  shaving in front of the broken mirrors as close to earth as he can get.
[02:15.660 --> 02:19.460]  You look like you look like you're scared you're going to fall off the ground.
[02:19.460 --> 02:21.340]  Here's the thing about a mirror when it breaks.
[02:21.540 --> 02:22.520]  It's all still a mirror.
[02:23.760 --> 02:24.720]  Yeah, this.
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.520]  So so this all started because we had Chris Damaris on 100%
[02:29.520 --> 02:33.300]  Eat on the Michael Jordan podcast, and he talked about how he evolved shaving.
[02:33.440 --> 02:35.660]  We were swimming the other day and brought this up.
[02:35.880 --> 02:38.420]  He said he evolved shaving by hanging a mirror in a tree
[02:38.420 --> 02:43.180]  and he's been shaving outside and a room of 150 people laughed at him
[02:43.180 --> 02:44.660]  like for a very long time.
[02:44.740 --> 02:48.880]  And then Gavin went, I shave outside and then showed me his setup.
[02:49.460 --> 02:51.400]  It was like, oh, no.
[02:52.560 --> 02:55.500]  Yeah, for those who can't see, it's just sort of tucked around the side.
[02:56.060 --> 02:58.480]  There's just two pieces of a broken mirror on the ground.
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.140]  And I squat real close up right next to it.
[03:01.260 --> 03:04.780]  First, I have to dust off the mirror because it's covered in pollen constantly.
[03:05.120 --> 03:06.700]  And then I just have a little shave.
[03:07.200 --> 03:09.140]  You got to figure out the mirror situation.
[03:09.400 --> 03:11.180]  And if you do that, I'm fully on board.
[03:11.320 --> 03:14.080]  Me too. I have no problem with this.
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.020]  If the if the mirror is hanging, this all makes sense.
[03:18.020 --> 03:23.140]  It's two broken shards of a mirror in the rocky ground
[03:23.920 --> 03:26.480]  leaned up against the side of a house.
[03:26.880 --> 03:28.700]  It's the storm drain.
[03:28.880 --> 03:29.640]  It's like it's all.
[03:31.880 --> 03:34.740]  So what would you do with with my situation?
[03:34.840 --> 03:36.460]  How would you put the mirror up on something?
[03:37.160 --> 03:38.840]  He'd probably get a different mirror.
[03:39.160 --> 03:41.360]  Yeah, a different mirror and double sided tape.
[03:41.820 --> 03:43.340]  Like he'd probably give up on that one.
[03:43.440 --> 03:44.620]  Yeah, it might be time to move on.
[03:45.960 --> 03:49.240]  Does double sided tape work on what is that shit?
[03:49.420 --> 03:51.280]  Stucco? Yeah. Yeah.
[03:51.360 --> 03:55.480]  I mean, you could you could try or, you know, there is that box
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.640]  that is right above where the mirror is where you could probably like lean a mirror.
[04:00.140 --> 04:02.740]  I don't know.
[04:02.800 --> 04:06.060]  I don't want to kill people walking by, knocking it down
[04:06.060 --> 04:08.980]  and putting the razor sharp shard into their foot.
[04:09.040 --> 04:12.820]  Well, I mean, your lawn guy doesn't go this way anymore because you're your lawn guy.
[04:12.900 --> 04:14.420]  So you don't have anything to worry about.
[04:14.420 --> 04:15.300]  It's true.
[04:15.540 --> 04:20.740]  I think realistically, Velcro is probably going to be a real assistant here.
[04:20.940 --> 04:22.080]  You know, you know what?
[04:22.200 --> 04:25.200]  Some people use nails or screws.
[04:25.600 --> 04:27.860]  It's not like you can't put a screw in the outside.
[04:28.200 --> 04:31.080]  No, that's how all that shit is hanging off of it.
[04:31.120 --> 04:32.640]  Have you screwed it to stucco?
[04:33.100 --> 04:33.560]  Yeah, sure.
[04:34.460 --> 04:35.080]  Yeah. Horrible. Sure.
[04:36.000 --> 04:36.940]  For 10 minutes.
[04:37.360 --> 04:39.880]  Problem is that pollen gets on the mirror every day.
[04:40.180 --> 04:44.000]  So I think the solution is you have a smaller internal mirror
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.520]  that has Velcro on it and you have the Velcro strips outside
[04:47.520 --> 04:51.620]  and you bring the mirror out with you, attach it to the Velcro,
[04:51.860 --> 04:55.300]  do your shave, then bring the mirror back in with you when you're done.
[04:55.680 --> 04:58.920]  I like the idea of having a little go bag by the door for my shaving kit.
[04:59.280 --> 05:00.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:00.700 --> 05:04.180]  Nick said, what if you put a window there with a mirror on the other side?
[05:04.420 --> 05:05.720]  So I'd be looking...
[05:05.720 --> 05:07.900]  Now we're talking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:08.120 --> 05:11.420]  So from the inside, there's just a mirror
[05:11.420 --> 05:14.200]  that's facing the wrong way, blocking a window.
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.580]  Yeah. What if what if you just have a regular ass mirror outside,
[05:18.920 --> 05:20.980]  but you install windshield wipers on it?
[05:21.340 --> 05:23.280]  Oh, that's nice.
[05:23.660 --> 05:24.980]  What if it's a two way mirror?
[05:25.380 --> 05:28.580]  So it just looks like a window from the inside and the outside.
[05:29.020 --> 05:30.400]  And then Meg can watch you.
[05:30.760 --> 05:32.080]  Shmee can watch you right there.
[05:32.380 --> 05:36.200]  Shmee will sit watching you shave and you won't even know.
[05:37.380 --> 05:40.040]  Now, that's the best idea. Yeah, I love that idea.
[05:40.040 --> 05:43.540]  And then you can bring people to that part of the yard and interrogate them.
[05:43.740 --> 05:45.180]  And then Shmee and Meg can watch.
[05:47.600 --> 05:49.540]  Just like it, just like at the police station.
[05:51.700 --> 05:53.480]  Or, or hear me out,
[05:54.060 --> 05:57.120]  you drill a second hole in your bathroom wall,
[05:57.540 --> 06:00.760]  one for the razor blades, the other for your facial hair.
[06:00.920 --> 06:04.280]  And you just start shoving your facial hair through the back of your wall.
[06:04.600 --> 06:06.760]  So I just catch it and mail it out?
[06:07.320 --> 06:09.680]  Yeah, just have it have it catch in some way.
[06:09.680 --> 06:11.740]  Just grab it in your hands, I guess, all the way down.
[06:11.960 --> 06:13.680]  And then just push that through the wall.
[06:14.060 --> 06:18.080]  Oh, maybe I could get, you know, those like old school whole house
[06:18.080 --> 06:21.880]  vacuum things like this, like vacuum for the ones that go under the floor.
[06:22.120 --> 06:23.560]  Yeah. What if I just have one of those?
[06:23.600 --> 06:25.140]  But it's just a tube to the outside.
[06:25.700 --> 06:29.560]  No, you want it in your wall because hair, hair acts as a natural insulator.
[06:30.160 --> 06:31.820]  You'll be making your house more energy efficient.
[06:32.300 --> 06:34.100]  Fill up my walls with my beard.
[06:34.580 --> 06:36.700]  Yeah, yeah. It's green, Gavin.
[06:36.700 --> 06:42.060]  What would typically be a small house fire erupted in a massive blaze?
[06:43.380 --> 06:46.500]  Can you imagine a house burning built out of hair?
[06:46.680 --> 06:49.260]  It would be the worst fucking smell on earth.
[06:49.620 --> 06:53.720]  Dude, it would be like it would be the greatest like final immunity
[06:53.720 --> 06:55.460]  fire challenge win of all time.
[06:55.560 --> 06:58.740]  You would instantly it's all it would burn out so quick.
[06:59.200 --> 07:03.040]  The worst part of this setup is that I was cleaning out my gutters a few months ago
[07:03.040 --> 07:06.580]  and I found a shitload of my beard.
[07:06.580 --> 07:07.500]  Up in one of the guys.
[07:08.260 --> 07:09.180]  Oh, oh, wow.
[07:09.740 --> 07:13.820]  The how serious the birds had used it for nest.
[07:16.700 --> 07:17.340]  That's great.
[07:18.560 --> 07:19.800]  So you're helping the birds.
[07:20.100 --> 07:23.900]  It was the inside of one of my cushions, my outdoor cushions.
[07:24.240 --> 07:25.920]  Squirrels have shredded that and the birds stole it.
[07:25.920 --> 07:29.800]  And then they also mixed it with a little bit of my beard for the optimal bird nest.
[07:31.040 --> 07:32.180]  Oh, you know what you could do?
[07:32.740 --> 07:34.940]  You know, you could do you could take this in a different direction.
[07:34.940 --> 07:36.480]  You could be more community oriented.
[07:36.920 --> 07:39.440]  Do you know? And to spread the word, you know, people have those little lending
[07:39.440 --> 07:42.620]  libraries in their front yard where you put like a little box on a stick
[07:42.620 --> 07:43.420]  and you throw books in it.
[07:43.440 --> 07:46.660]  Yeah. What if you'd made a lending shaving library
[07:46.660 --> 07:49.880]  where you just stuck that in your front yard and then people could come by
[07:49.880 --> 07:51.180]  and then they could shave right there?
[07:51.260 --> 07:54.860]  You just have a stick with a mirror on it and like a little shelf to put your stuff.
[07:55.380 --> 07:56.940]  It's like a communal shaving station.
[07:56.980 --> 07:58.640]  Yeah, just like anybody in the neighborhood when they're walking by.
[07:58.700 --> 08:00.100]  They could be like, oh, I'll do a quick shave.
[08:00.200 --> 08:03.200]  I bet I could put that out, leave it there for a year
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.420]  and not a single person would ever touch it.
[08:05.880 --> 08:07.120]  I'd be the only place I shave.
[08:08.720 --> 08:10.440]  I would come once a week just to shave.
[08:10.440 --> 08:11.020]  I don't even shave.
[08:11.140 --> 08:13.700]  I would come every week just to shave right there,
[08:14.960 --> 08:18.160]  hoping that I would run into other people to build to build a shaving community.
[08:18.900 --> 08:20.320]  What a fascinating idea.
[08:20.700 --> 08:22.120]  Be a field of dreams. If you build it, they'll come.
[08:22.620 --> 08:24.380]  If you build it, they'll shave. I don't think so.
[08:24.580 --> 08:26.880]  So am I providing the the shaver there?
[08:27.820 --> 08:29.500]  No, I think you want. I think you provide.
[08:29.680 --> 08:31.760]  Well, I mean, it could be like a lending library, right?
[08:31.760 --> 08:34.500]  So maybe you like take a book, leave a book kind of thing.
[08:34.800 --> 08:36.940]  Yeah, that's you have to you have to put in the starter.
[08:37.100 --> 08:39.140]  You provide you provide seed shaving. Yeah.
[08:39.940 --> 08:42.640]  And you'll put like Gillette and somebody else to be like, oh, no, I like
[08:42.640 --> 08:46.140]  a I like a dollar shave club myself and build out.
[08:46.320 --> 08:47.120]  Then we'll have variety.
[08:49.780 --> 08:51.080]  I what does it look like?
[08:51.080 --> 08:51.740]  Is it a house?
[08:52.300 --> 08:53.820]  What does the shave box look like?
[08:54.380 --> 08:56.780]  Oh, I think it could look like anything you want it to.
[08:57.680 --> 08:58.940]  What would you want it to look like?
[08:58.980 --> 09:01.420]  I think it should just look like a bathroom mirror on a stick.
[09:02.420 --> 09:03.720]  Yeah, I agree.
[09:05.400 --> 09:07.800]  Oh, it would be nice if there was some.
[09:08.460 --> 09:09.620]  Now, how would that work?
[09:10.600 --> 09:13.280]  I was thinking like somehow it's like a face
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.140]  and the more full it is, the fuller the face looks like you do it.
[09:18.180 --> 09:21.080]  You could visually tell how much supplies.
[09:23.240 --> 09:24.420]  Well, I'm trying to keep going.
[09:25.060 --> 09:26.500]  No, no, keep going. This is good. Listen.
[09:26.800 --> 09:31.260]  Yeah, we're in a fantasy world in which you have set up a shave station outside.
[09:31.760 --> 09:32.660]  That is communal.
[09:32.860 --> 09:34.700]  But it's still bound by the laws of physics.
[09:34.860 --> 09:35.620]  Yeah, carry on.
[09:36.100 --> 09:42.780]  OK, but it could be something where it's like a like a like a what's
[09:42.780 --> 09:44.040]  the word I'm looking for? Not plastic.
[09:45.160 --> 09:47.140]  Like a not a leather thing.
[09:47.300 --> 09:52.180]  You know what? Like a like a sheet, like a sheet of some kind of fabric.
[09:52.620 --> 09:55.920]  Not fabric, but not plastic, like stretchy.
[09:56.240 --> 09:58.000]  It's like a stretchy material.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.340]  Yeah, like an elastic type cover.
[10:00.680 --> 10:02.760]  Rubber is what I was looking for.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.980]  Thank you. A rubber like material
[10:06.620 --> 10:12.580]  that the more you put stuff in, the further the face pushes out.
[10:13.020 --> 10:16.260]  Well, so you can tell because it's the box is a face.
[10:16.960 --> 10:23.060]  The box, the box, if it's empty, looks like a clean shaven face.
[10:23.520 --> 10:27.220]  And if it's full, it like push it.
[10:27.220 --> 10:29.500]  I don't know. Well, listen, we'll figure it out.
[10:29.500 --> 10:32.240]  What if we'll just figure it out?
[10:32.400 --> 10:35.160]  We'll scout some hair from the birds.
[10:35.280 --> 10:37.420]  We'll borrow some of your facial hair back from the birds.
[10:37.580 --> 10:42.800]  And it will be like a chia pet where the more stuff in it
[10:42.800 --> 10:45.560]  pushes the hair outward of the face.
[10:45.660 --> 10:48.360]  So people could go like, oh, shit, the box is empty.
[10:48.380 --> 10:51.820]  It's clean shaven or oh, my God, that is a massive beard.
[10:51.900 --> 10:54.580]  There is tons of supplies in this shave box.
[10:54.580 --> 10:57.300]  It sounds like we're making a giant communal voodoo doll.
[10:57.740 --> 10:59.160]  Well, what do you mean by that?
[10:59.560 --> 11:02.280]  Well, it's just going to be a but it's going to put a face on it
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.540]  somehow with hair that grows as a cabbage patch kid, a voodoo doll.
[11:06.760 --> 11:09.380]  Just because you put a face on something doesn't make it a voodoo doll.
[11:09.620 --> 11:10.500]  I mean, I think it could be.
[11:11.420 --> 11:14.260]  But but does a cabbage patch kid have real human hair on it?
[11:14.740 --> 11:17.800]  I don't think it's real hair, but I bet you there's a doll out there
[11:17.800 --> 11:18.880]  that has real human hair.
[11:19.480 --> 11:22.220]  What? Where? Really? Do you think?
[11:22.300 --> 11:23.940]  Well, I don't know. I think somewhere.
[11:23.940 --> 11:27.500]  Probably. You could probably buy a doll that has human hair
[11:28.190 --> 11:29.720]  because people donate hair all the time.
[11:29.820 --> 11:31.380]  You can buy wigs with real human hair.
[11:31.800 --> 11:33.220]  Yeah, but I feel like that's a good use for it.
[11:33.280 --> 11:36.080]  Not a doll. Is the Play-Doh thing?
[11:36.640 --> 11:39.620]  I mean, that's definitely not.
[11:39.620 --> 11:42.100]  Also, also, is this what you're talking about?
[11:42.200 --> 11:45.420]  Like then you put stuff in the box and it grows Play-Doh hair or something?
[11:45.820 --> 11:49.300]  Yeah. Like it pushes the things in the box.
[11:49.360 --> 11:51.680]  Push the hair outward.
[11:52.700 --> 11:57.340]  If you gave me a sieve and a handful of hair, I couldn't push the hair through it.
[11:57.480 --> 11:58.940]  Well, that sounds like a you problem.
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.220]  We're not talking about you.
[12:00.240 --> 12:03.020]  Yeah. Yeah. This box has it all figured out, Gavin.
[12:03.140 --> 12:04.340]  How come you can't do it?
[12:04.760 --> 12:07.100]  I'm not asking you to physically push the...
[12:07.100 --> 12:08.840]  And I was just throwing it out as a concept.
[12:08.980 --> 12:12.200]  I just like the idea of there being a visual indicator
[12:12.200 --> 12:14.440]  without having to open the box of how full the box is.
[12:15.240 --> 12:17.800]  And it made sense to me that if it's a shave box,
[12:18.300 --> 12:19.860]  it would be somehow beard related.
[12:19.860 --> 12:23.740]  So what we need, we need a bathroom mirror on a stick next to it.
[12:23.740 --> 12:26.700]  I put one right there in the chat.
[12:26.800 --> 12:28.440]  Just stick that bottom part in the ground.
[12:28.740 --> 12:32.160]  Next to it is a mannequin head with like a glue trap on the chin.
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.500]  And everyone could just stick their minging beard head to it.
[12:36.540 --> 12:39.900]  OK, listen, that's that's a more realistic idea.
[12:40.120 --> 12:41.000]  I want to be clear.
[12:41.180 --> 12:44.120]  I'm the guy that threw out you should put Velcro on your wall.
[12:44.360 --> 12:45.900]  I started very practical.
[12:46.420 --> 12:48.000]  I would argue maybe the most practical,
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.120]  the least invasive to the space, least amount of work.
[12:51.220 --> 12:54.160]  But you realize the Velcro isn't the attachment to the wall.
[12:54.440 --> 12:57.140]  I still have to get the Velcro on the wall.
[12:57.560 --> 12:58.460]  Yeah, it works both ways.
[12:58.660 --> 13:02.680]  You attach when you listen to someone who's made a wrist pocket with Velcro.
[13:03.260 --> 13:05.080]  Half of it is tapeable.
[13:05.540 --> 13:08.040]  Yeah. And you put that part to the wall, the tapeable part.
[13:08.220 --> 13:09.360]  Yeah. That you peel.
[13:09.700 --> 13:13.220]  And then you put the other half that attaches to the back of the mirror.
[13:14.080 --> 13:15.540]  Yeah, sure. I'm just going to come and go.
[13:15.660 --> 13:17.920]  The first time I use it, I'm pulling that tape straight off.
[13:17.920 --> 13:19.460]  But the Velcro is going to be on the back.
[13:19.520 --> 13:20.980]  Who the fuck do you think you are?
[13:21.400 --> 13:23.580]  Respectfully, you're not Hercules, OK?
[13:23.680 --> 13:24.680]  That Velcro is going to stick.
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.360]  You think you're fucking the sword in the stone, like you're King Arthur,
[13:29.680 --> 13:31.600]  like you're the fucking knight in shaver?
[13:31.940 --> 13:32.880]  Get out of here.
[13:33.300 --> 13:35.420]  That mirror is just coming off. It's going to stay.
[13:35.720 --> 13:36.420]  It's fine.
[13:38.360 --> 13:40.540]  Can you say anything like that?
[13:40.620 --> 13:43.440]  Just say respectfully and you get away with it?
[13:43.900 --> 13:47.600]  It's. Respectfully,
[13:47.900 --> 13:51.200]  do you think any of this tells the story?
[13:51.340 --> 13:53.560]  Like if somebody walks by and they see it, do you think they know
[13:53.560 --> 13:56.400]  or do you think we're going to have to help them by doing something
[13:57.660 --> 13:59.700]  like putting a sign up?
[14:01.360 --> 14:02.180]  Nobody's going to know.
[14:02.520 --> 14:03.220]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[14:03.620 --> 14:05.040]  Here's a quick little mock up I did.
[14:06.220 --> 14:08.000]  You put a. Oh, cool.
[14:08.220 --> 14:08.780]  Boy, you could.
[14:08.920 --> 14:11.620]  You could hit the undo button a couple of times.
[14:12.120 --> 14:13.120]  You can read it.
[14:13.120 --> 14:13.700]  You can see it.
[14:13.780 --> 14:16.840]  It's a folding sign that says shave with an arrow pointed in
[14:16.840 --> 14:18.580]  and then it'll be pointed towards the mirror.
[14:19.020 --> 14:20.540]  So that way people will know.
[14:21.140 --> 14:23.060]  I think I don't have room for the E.
[14:24.580 --> 14:25.660]  I had to go back.
[14:26.320 --> 14:29.000]  Maybe this is like a lemonade stand that also has shaving.
[14:30.080 --> 14:32.980]  Nick says it looks like a trap by the coyote.
[14:34.300 --> 14:38.000]  This is how Gavin is going to get Nick in a trap.
[14:38.300 --> 14:41.180]  It's going to be that and a bunch of bread crumbs under a box.
[14:41.180 --> 14:44.360]  I was saying, why don't we just say tarts on it and then he's done.
[14:53.470 --> 14:54.170]  All right, then.
[14:54.270 --> 14:57.610]  Well, then, you genius schmuck, respectfully, how do you shave?
[14:57.690 --> 14:58.510]  Where does your beard go?
[14:59.470 --> 15:00.570]  I don't shave.
[15:00.970 --> 15:02.010]  You don't shave ever?
[15:02.750 --> 15:04.590]  No, I haven't shaved in like three years.
[15:04.670 --> 15:06.170]  I got tired of shaving, so I just stopped.
[15:06.910 --> 15:08.690]  Well, is it down to your nipples?
[15:09.250 --> 15:10.890]  No, it's just it's maintained.
[15:11.110 --> 15:12.390]  It's fine. It's where it is.
[15:12.510 --> 15:13.530]  It's just critical mass.
[15:14.230 --> 15:14.510]  Yeah.
[15:14.950 --> 15:17.570]  And when I got my haircut, like, I don't know, five months ago,
[15:17.570 --> 15:18.910]  it got trimmed a little bit by the guy.
[15:18.990 --> 15:19.750]  I didn't even ask for it.
[15:19.830 --> 15:21.090]  He just trimmed it, styled it.
[15:21.550 --> 15:24.110]  You still don't have a beard in in my head.
[15:24.230 --> 15:26.370]  I don't I don't know why I can't apply the beard.
[15:26.550 --> 15:30.810]  I got sick of shaving, so I just said, I'm not going to do this anymore.
[15:31.330 --> 15:31.790]  Is this you?
[15:32.390 --> 15:33.670]  No, way less.
[15:34.990 --> 15:35.730]  Significantly less.
[15:35.990 --> 15:36.370]  Less than that?
[15:37.010 --> 15:37.290]  Yeah.
[15:37.950 --> 15:39.930]  Do you put oils in it?
[15:39.970 --> 15:40.570]  Do you comb it?
[15:40.770 --> 15:41.170]  Do you do anything?
[15:41.510 --> 15:43.330]  No, absolutely not.
[15:43.730 --> 15:43.930]  Huh?
[15:44.430 --> 15:46.290]  Because I didn't feel like shaving anymore.
[15:46.290 --> 15:48.030]  That would then just be beard work.
[15:48.130 --> 15:49.810]  The point is, I didn't want to do face work.
[15:50.590 --> 15:53.210]  I would just be moving the shave work to the beard work.
[15:53.290 --> 15:54.810]  And I have no interest in the beard work.
[15:55.050 --> 15:57.110]  You just want to eliminate work from the whole.
[15:57.130 --> 15:58.450]  I just wanted to get rid.
[15:58.530 --> 16:00.510]  I just didn't care about any of it.
[16:00.610 --> 16:01.610]  So I moved on.
[16:02.730 --> 16:04.150]  Fuck it, I'm going to get oils.
[16:05.850 --> 16:06.210]  Ridiculous.
[16:07.090 --> 16:08.410]  Is it a style choice?
[16:08.430 --> 16:09.910]  You must, like, shampoo it and stuff.
[16:10.010 --> 16:10.770]  That's beard work.
[16:11.210 --> 16:12.470]  Yeah, well, this is part of the show.
[16:12.530 --> 16:15.150]  I mean, I'm getting blasted in the face and my beard is there.
[16:15.150 --> 16:17.490]  Yeah, he's already doing water work.
[16:17.610 --> 16:18.890]  It just happens to be a part of it.
[16:18.890 --> 16:20.110]  The water work is part of...
[16:20.110 --> 16:21.890]  Yeah, it's not additional work.
[16:22.290 --> 16:22.510]  Huh.
[16:22.790 --> 16:25.010]  I mean, I guess you're not supposed to shampoo it or something.
[16:25.010 --> 16:25.430]  I don't know.
[16:25.930 --> 16:26.730]  It's a whole thing.
[16:27.330 --> 16:32.050]  You surely need to trim the sides, like around the cheeks back by the ears.
[16:32.110 --> 16:33.290]  Otherwise, it's going to come out sideways.
[16:33.910 --> 16:35.910]  No, I don't. Listen, the whole point.
[16:36.390 --> 16:38.450]  This was not, as I said, a style thing.
[16:38.470 --> 16:39.450]  I don't care about that.
[16:39.530 --> 16:42.630]  This was a protesting against the work of shaving.
[16:43.690 --> 16:44.130]  Protesting?
[16:44.750 --> 16:46.370]  Well, protesting is maybe a strong word.
[16:46.470 --> 16:47.430]  I just I was done with it.
[16:47.430 --> 16:50.410]  So you you would say your your face is a protest?
[16:51.550 --> 16:52.890]  That's maybe, I guess.
[16:52.950 --> 16:54.170]  I don't know. But not like actively.
[16:54.850 --> 16:56.010]  I'm not going to make signs.
[16:56.430 --> 16:58.490]  Well, it seems like that seems like more work.
[16:58.990 --> 17:00.750]  How much is visible from the back?
[17:01.010 --> 17:04.330]  Like if we had to draw a silhouette from behind, how much of your beard
[17:04.710 --> 17:05.930]  is sticking out from your head?
[17:05.950 --> 17:06.690]  I don't listen.
[17:06.770 --> 17:10.330]  I don't. I think that's a tough thing because of the size of my head.
[17:10.790 --> 17:12.870]  I don't know if that...
[17:12.870 --> 17:17.890]  But the size of your head, the beard should be appropriate to the size of your head
[17:17.890 --> 17:21.230]  because the beard grows out of this, out of that sized head.
[17:21.690 --> 17:23.030]  It grows out of the edge of your head.
[17:23.430 --> 17:24.050]  I'm going to be honest.
[17:24.190 --> 17:28.330]  I don't look at myself from the back all that often, so I couldn't.
[17:29.110 --> 17:30.030]  I'm not sure.
[17:30.650 --> 17:33.610]  Are you saying you have the facial hair of a much smaller man?
[17:33.990 --> 17:36.030]  I think I probably do.
[17:36.430 --> 17:38.970]  He has a full beard, but it looks like a goatee on Andrew.
[17:41.430 --> 17:44.670]  It's not. Well, yeah, it's bigger than a goatee.
[17:45.310 --> 17:46.450]  It kind of curls.
[17:46.810 --> 17:47.990]  So it kind of waves.
[17:48.310 --> 17:50.890]  I think that's probably helping for the length.
[17:51.530 --> 17:53.570]  And when you get a haircut, they don't mess with it.
[17:53.910 --> 17:54.630]  No, they did.
[17:54.710 --> 17:56.190]  That's what I said last time I got a haircut.
[17:56.510 --> 17:57.270]  Oh, the guy.
[17:57.710 --> 17:59.370]  Johnny trimmed it, which is great.
[17:59.870 --> 18:00.710]  I didn't ask for it.
[18:00.750 --> 18:01.850]  I'd never. Johnny, I don't know.
[18:02.530 --> 18:05.150]  Caviar? Johnny, my barber, the barber.
[18:05.470 --> 18:06.010]  Johnny, the barber.
[18:06.010 --> 18:10.970]  If you if yeah, but but his name being Johnny doesn't.
[18:11.190 --> 18:13.850]  I know that you're going to tell us you're going to we're going to.
[18:13.990 --> 18:15.290]  I don't believe that.
[18:15.310 --> 18:17.930]  And I think we're going to find out that you're a barber on the side.
[18:18.010 --> 18:18.550]  I'm not you.
[18:19.370 --> 18:20.790]  Listen, I'm not in the Freemasons, OK?
[18:20.910 --> 18:23.870]  I don't I can't claim the qualification.
[18:24.430 --> 18:27.950]  What if we find out that there is an actual Johnny Caviar
[18:27.950 --> 18:31.830]  who lives somewhere in the Naimo that Andrew has stolen the identity of?
[18:32.050 --> 18:34.030]  It's exactly what's going to that. That's what's happening.
[18:34.470 --> 18:37.150]  There's a 72 year old barber on
[18:38.430 --> 18:40.150]  Vancouver Island named Johnny Caviar.
[18:40.550 --> 18:44.310]  He was a 72 year old barber when he was cutting hair at the old folks home
[18:44.310 --> 18:47.210]  and then he died and his identity was assumed.
[18:47.670 --> 18:48.370]  He might be dead.
[18:50.410 --> 18:53.510]  Andrew went there to get his haircut one day and they're like, oh, no, he's dead.
[18:53.570 --> 18:55.010]  But he left this box of stuff.
[18:55.350 --> 18:56.630]  Would you mail his death certificate?
[18:56.770 --> 18:59.690]  Andrew's like, yeah, sure. No problem. Trash.
[19:00.890 --> 19:02.010]  I take over the identity.
[19:02.010 --> 19:03.730]  No, didn't happen.
[19:04.230 --> 19:04.910]  Johnny's great.
[19:05.630 --> 19:06.930]  I don't get my hair cut often.
[19:07.050 --> 19:08.310]  It's maybe like a once a year thing.
[19:08.450 --> 19:10.930]  I think last time was like a year and a half or two years between cuts.
[19:12.750 --> 19:14.590]  Johnny's great. He might be dead, but he's great.
[19:15.070 --> 19:16.850]  No, I haven't heard from him in two years.
[19:17.350 --> 19:17.870]  No, he's good.
[19:17.950 --> 19:21.070]  Well, he he thought I didn't he subscribed to the podcast
[19:21.070 --> 19:22.330]  the first time I went.
[19:22.690 --> 19:25.290]  And then I guess somebody mentioned
[19:26.530 --> 19:29.170]  hearing about his barbershop on the podcast.
[19:29.170 --> 19:33.210]  And then he thought that I didn't like the cut because I never showed up again.
[19:33.550 --> 19:34.930]  I just I just didn't cut my hair.
[19:35.070 --> 19:38.270]  And the time period between it's like a two year hiatus.
[19:39.390 --> 19:42.430]  I'll be back in like a year and a half circle around.
[19:44.630 --> 19:45.810]  Check in on things.
[19:46.410 --> 19:49.150]  It's nice to touch base every two years with someone.
[19:50.590 --> 19:52.030]  A lot happens in that time.
[19:52.130 --> 19:54.770]  It's easy to find conversation when you have a two year window.
[19:55.250 --> 19:56.990]  Yeah, but then all you're doing is catching up.
[19:57.030 --> 19:57.890]  That's great, though.
[19:57.890 --> 20:00.110]  That's the cycle you and I were on for a long time, Andrew.
[20:00.510 --> 20:01.250]  That's not true.
[20:01.810 --> 20:03.810]  Oh, once we had a one time cycle of that.
[20:04.310 --> 20:05.850]  Yeah. One time.
[20:06.110 --> 20:06.770]  That's not a lot.
[20:07.450 --> 20:09.890]  Do you think two years from now you'll reconnect with Johnny
[20:09.890 --> 20:11.430]  and then you guys will start a podcast together?
[20:11.870 --> 20:13.070]  No. No.
[20:14.430 --> 20:16.450]  I don't want to fuck up my haircutting situation.
[20:18.030 --> 20:19.730]  I don't I don't want to get a new guy.
[20:19.870 --> 20:22.250]  It's tough to get a new guy going back to the first episode.
[20:22.550 --> 20:23.530]  Some things are just more important.
[20:24.810 --> 20:26.090]  Yeah. Like not shaving.
[20:26.830 --> 20:27.590]  Sick of it.
[20:28.070 --> 20:31.890]  Got to get the blades and then they get dull and then you have to get the cream.
[20:32.110 --> 20:35.910]  And I never was confident I was doing it right to begin with.
[20:36.150 --> 20:37.810]  Just use like an electric trimmer.
[20:39.030 --> 20:40.170]  That seems intense.
[20:41.250 --> 20:44.070]  Don't trust. Yeah, it's not that I don't trust it.
[20:44.550 --> 20:47.530]  I'm sure it has an instruction manual on the inside.
[20:47.650 --> 20:52.070]  I just I don't know how to do the if I'm not confident in my ability
[20:52.070 --> 20:55.750]  to use the handheld going electric seems like a big step.
[20:55.750 --> 20:56.770]  It's still handheld.
[20:56.970 --> 21:00.870]  It's not like a lawnmower, but it does the burr.
[21:02.190 --> 21:05.490]  Well, I mean, a lot of a lot more stand held to unless you're sitting on it.
[21:05.530 --> 21:06.030]  Oh, that's true.
[21:06.370 --> 21:07.630]  It's hand and gravity held.
[21:08.550 --> 21:10.810]  Are you not holding the wheel when you're sitting on it?
[21:11.750 --> 21:14.450]  Yeah, but that's more like you wouldn't say a car is handheld.
[21:17.470 --> 21:19.070]  What would you say a car is, though?
[21:19.450 --> 21:21.090]  I think it's more immersive than that.
[21:21.310 --> 21:25.650]  I think it's a it's more of a it's more of a full experience.
[21:25.750 --> 21:26.930]  Are you trying to sell me a car?
[21:27.110 --> 21:28.650]  3D immersive experience.
[21:28.830 --> 21:30.050]  A fully OK.
[21:30.890 --> 21:33.190]  Well, everything could be a fully 3D immersive experience.
[21:33.570 --> 21:38.390]  If the doors on the shave station open up wide and you're fully surrounded,
[21:38.470 --> 21:39.270]  that's fully 3D.
[21:39.670 --> 21:42.910]  Speaking of experiences, I had, Andrew,
[21:43.030 --> 21:47.470]  I had an experience around you today about you
[21:48.070 --> 21:49.510]  that I was not prepared for.
[21:49.650 --> 21:53.070]  I, uh, I, you know, we full disclosure,
[21:53.070 --> 21:56.050]  we're recording episode nine here the day after we recorded episode eight.
[21:56.550 --> 21:59.750]  And right after we ended, I mentioned that I was going to mail you a care package.
[21:59.870 --> 22:04.310]  I have your Kerwin Frost McDonald action figures that I need to give back to you
[22:04.310 --> 22:05.270]  that we opened on the break show.
[22:05.910 --> 22:09.370]  I have just some random like face stuff.
[22:09.430 --> 22:11.590]  And it was like a sloppy joes bingo in there for some reason.
[22:11.690 --> 22:12.430]  I don't even remember why.
[22:12.490 --> 22:18.110]  And also the two video games I went to Las Vegas to get for you four years ago.
[22:18.170 --> 22:19.230]  I put those in there.
[22:20.630 --> 22:25.290]  And I put in the GoXLR mixer that I bought that doesn't work on a Mac
[22:25.290 --> 22:27.890]  so that we can upgrade your audio.
[22:28.210 --> 22:32.030]  And then I went swung by Gavin's house and he gave me a phone to put in there,
[22:32.130 --> 22:35.310]  which, by the way, the phone says it's contained soy oil,
[22:35.470 --> 22:36.370]  which I thought was interesting.
[22:36.810 --> 22:38.510]  I don't know if phones contained soy oil.
[22:38.790 --> 22:43.410]  What? It was a it was a sign on the back of the box that said contained soy oil.
[22:43.690 --> 22:45.710]  Wow. Did you have to declare that?
[22:46.530 --> 22:46.970]  Probably.
[22:46.970 --> 22:52.370]  This is so then I just put all that shit in a box and then I went with your address
[22:52.370 --> 22:54.230]  and I went to the place to mail shit.
[22:54.330 --> 22:56.450]  I'm not going to out the company, but it wasn't the post office.
[22:57.150 --> 23:00.290]  And and I said, I'd like to mail this to my friend in Canada, please.
[23:00.350 --> 23:01.570]  And she said, is it a gift?
[23:01.610 --> 23:02.450]  And I said, absolutely.
[23:02.530 --> 23:03.970]  It's a series of gifts I'm giving a friend.
[23:04.310 --> 23:07.570]  And she said, OK, I need to look at them.
[23:07.630 --> 23:08.550]  And I'm like, excuse me.
[23:08.550 --> 23:09.850]  And she's like, I have to look at all of them.
[23:09.870 --> 23:11.770]  And I'm like, OK, thank God they weren't wrapped.
[23:12.550 --> 23:14.790]  But she's like, but the box was open, so it wasn't a big deal.
[23:15.190 --> 23:20.850]  And then she meticulously had to enter in every single item.
[23:20.970 --> 23:22.670]  And I was like, can't we just say like toys?
[23:22.870 --> 23:23.910]  And she's like, no, they won't let us.
[23:24.950 --> 23:26.870]  Three employees got involved.
[23:27.050 --> 23:30.450]  I mean, seriously, like, OK, one action.
[23:30.530 --> 23:31.650]  What would you call this action figure?
[23:31.870 --> 23:33.070]  It's a McDonald's action figure.
[23:33.130 --> 23:34.670]  One McDonald's action figure.
[23:34.730 --> 23:36.110]  And what is the value of that one?
[23:37.230 --> 23:38.570]  It's like a dollar.
[23:38.690 --> 23:40.590]  She's like, OK, one dollar next action figure.
[23:40.710 --> 23:43.930]  And and we went through all like we went through like 15 of them.
[23:43.930 --> 23:46.350]  And each time I'd be like, can't we just say like all the action figures together?
[23:46.430 --> 23:48.350]  And she's like, no, I have to list each item individually.
[23:48.350 --> 23:51.270]  And then I thought she was going to have to list the pants and the hats and shit.
[23:51.350 --> 23:53.150]  But she didn't. She just wrote that down as accessories.
[23:53.590 --> 23:56.790]  Anyway, it took her about 25 minutes to enter it all into the computer.
[23:56.970 --> 24:00.630]  And then there was an error and then she had to start over.
[24:01.310 --> 24:03.190]  And so she did it all over again.
[24:03.470 --> 24:04.870]  And then there was an error.
[24:04.890 --> 24:08.590]  And all three of the employees decided maybe a different computer would work.
[24:08.670 --> 24:11.770]  Anyway, two computers and four tries.
[24:11.770 --> 24:17.170]  And 48 minutes later, I mailed your package.
[24:17.690 --> 24:22.630]  I was the only person in that store for 48 minutes while three employees
[24:22.630 --> 24:26.670]  tried to mail one fucking box of nothing to Canada.
[24:26.970 --> 24:30.310]  Oh, how is it? How is it so complicated?
[24:30.810 --> 24:36.950]  I feel like society as it as as a whole is grinding to a halt
[24:36.950 --> 24:41.450]  under just superfluous bureaucracy and paperwork.
[24:41.770 --> 24:44.950]  I don't understand how things have gotten so slow.
[24:45.310 --> 24:48.290]  God help you. You have to call somebody on the phone to do something.
[24:48.550 --> 24:50.270]  I already bitched about the AT&T thing.
[24:50.550 --> 24:52.950]  It took a fucking year to get new internet at my house.
[24:53.150 --> 24:57.410]  And now it takes a fucking hour to mail a box of toys to a friend
[24:57.410 --> 25:01.330]  in a neighboring country and $200, by the way,
[25:01.410 --> 25:02.830]  which is more than any of that shit was worth.
[25:03.030 --> 25:05.930]  I just don't understand how it got so fucking hard.
[25:06.190 --> 25:10.210]  It's 2024. We're living in the Jetsons fucking future.
[25:10.210 --> 25:13.510]  And it's harder to mail a box than it was 10 years ago.
[25:13.730 --> 25:16.870]  How? And that is the exact reason
[25:16.870 --> 25:19.870]  why that phone has been on my desk for three months.
[25:20.290 --> 25:22.250]  Why? You guys are just bad at mailing stuff.
[25:22.610 --> 25:23.930]  You come here and mail you stuff.
[25:24.910 --> 25:28.790]  Oh, and also I'm calling dibs on last in the line to mail Andrew again.
[25:28.950 --> 25:30.330]  Next time it's somebody else.
[25:30.490 --> 25:32.450]  That's fucking... I got angry.
[25:32.810 --> 25:35.050]  I was so mad. I don't need it.
[25:35.050 --> 25:36.990]  I mailed it. I mailed him a puzzle yesterday.
[25:37.190 --> 25:38.550]  So it's got to be him next.
[25:38.550 --> 25:40.930]  I need to figure out where I'm going to do that puzzle.
[25:41.610 --> 25:42.610]  I don't have a table.
[25:43.190 --> 25:44.290]  I'll figure it out.
[25:44.390 --> 25:45.670]  I don't want a table.
[25:46.490 --> 25:47.690]  We just spent money on it.
[25:47.910 --> 25:50.710]  This was like, yeah, this is like one of our first like company purchases.
[25:51.230 --> 25:52.950]  And you're yeah, I'll figure it out.
[25:53.030 --> 25:55.010]  Nothing was prepared for the puzzle like you did.
[25:55.010 --> 25:56.510]  What do you mean prepared for the puzzle?
[25:56.630 --> 25:58.470]  You're going to like build it on your bed.
[25:58.750 --> 25:59.610]  This is not going to be good.
[25:59.690 --> 26:00.550]  That is a consideration.
[26:01.150 --> 26:04.110]  I'll probably reorganize my desk is what I'm thinking.
[26:04.530 --> 26:05.630]  This is going to be worse.
[26:05.990 --> 26:07.990]  It seems like you should just do it on the floor.
[26:08.510 --> 26:12.350]  You can fit a 500 piece puzzle on your desk.
[26:12.530 --> 26:14.110]  I have a really big desk.
[26:15.210 --> 26:18.790]  I have a I here's the problem with my desk and we're going to get in my desk
[26:18.790 --> 26:19.090]  for a minute.
[26:19.570 --> 26:22.510]  I have I have to connect the microphone.
[26:22.510 --> 26:25.670]  I use has one of those clamps on it, right?
[26:25.910 --> 26:27.030]  Where you clamp on the fridge.
[26:27.850 --> 26:29.530]  Well, it's now on a small table.
[26:29.610 --> 26:30.670]  It wouldn't work in the fridge.
[26:30.710 --> 26:31.770]  Unfortunately, still on the table.
[26:31.810 --> 26:32.610]  I guess we went over this.
[26:33.070 --> 26:33.870]  It's too thick.
[26:34.250 --> 26:36.790]  They don't make clamps big enough to clamp onto my desk.
[26:36.790 --> 26:40.290]  It's a real annoyance because my desk is massive.
[26:40.770 --> 26:43.090]  It's very thick, large desk.
[26:43.450 --> 26:45.950]  I bet I could find a I bet I could find a clamp big enough.
[26:46.110 --> 26:48.150]  I guarantee you can't.
[26:48.230 --> 26:52.030]  I got a clamp that could probably clamp around my fist, like thumb
[26:52.030 --> 26:52.750]  to little finger.
[26:53.030 --> 26:54.850]  Is your is your desk fatter than that?
[26:55.270 --> 26:56.730]  I just made a fist.
[26:57.050 --> 27:00.050]  It's significantly smaller than the thickness of my desk.
[27:00.610 --> 27:02.790]  I need a picture of your fist with the desk.
[27:03.970 --> 27:04.770]  Oh, OK.
[27:06.760 --> 27:08.080]  Let me try to figure this out.
[27:08.980 --> 27:12.300]  We're asking him to post pictures of the Umi Digi Bison again.
[27:12.560 --> 27:13.360]  Like, this is not.
[27:13.880 --> 27:17.300]  Also, even when he gets the cell phone, he's still using the Umi Digi Bison.
[27:18.380 --> 27:20.280]  Geoff, I don't want to mail anything to Andrew.
[27:21.900 --> 27:22.960]  I'm not doing it next.
[27:23.200 --> 27:25.060]  I'll do it. I'll do it when it's my turn again.
[27:25.100 --> 27:25.840]  But it's not my turn again.
[27:26.020 --> 27:27.420]  That's a 12 inch clamp.
[27:27.720 --> 27:28.600]  Surely that would work.
[27:29.580 --> 27:32.080]  That might be too lightweight for the mic on.
[27:32.080 --> 27:34.240]  Yeah, there's no way that's going to hold the mic.
[27:34.540 --> 27:35.660]  You think so?
[27:35.780 --> 27:38.780]  Dude, those are that's those are designed to hold two by fours together.
[27:38.960 --> 27:39.740]  I think it's huge.
[27:40.320 --> 27:41.640]  That's like woodworking shit.
[27:41.920 --> 27:43.900]  Yeah, maybe a couple of them.
[27:44.620 --> 27:47.840]  Yeah, the clamping capacity is 300 pounds.
[27:47.980 --> 27:49.400]  It's a 12 inch bar clamp.
[27:49.860 --> 27:52.420]  Throat depth is three and three sixteenths of an inch.
[27:52.440 --> 27:53.420]  It weighs two pounds.
[27:53.480 --> 27:54.580]  What? Throat depth?
[27:54.580 --> 27:55.360]  Throat depth.
[27:55.860 --> 27:58.280]  And then, uh, yeah, they say it right here.
[27:58.280 --> 28:02.980]  They said the Orwin clamp 12 inch with a three inch three and three
[28:03.420 --> 28:08.100]  sixteenths inch throat depth truly is the throat goat of clamps.
[28:08.660 --> 28:10.400]  What do you think your throat depth is?
[28:10.560 --> 28:13.900]  Yeah. Should we find out who the throat goat is of the regulation podcast?
[28:14.220 --> 28:16.860]  I wanted to put a balloon in and measure, but you wouldn't let me.
[28:17.120 --> 28:18.380]  Oh, we could do that now.
[28:19.720 --> 28:20.520]  No, no.
[28:20.720 --> 28:23.480]  You understand that that wasn't legal saying we can't do that.
[28:23.540 --> 28:25.680]  That was me saying, I don't want to watch one of you die.
[28:25.880 --> 28:27.200]  We certainly can't do it now.
[28:27.200 --> 28:31.400]  We certainly can't do it now where my mortgage hinges on you guys doing the show.
[28:31.480 --> 28:32.900]  What are you talking about?
[28:33.020 --> 28:35.060]  Don't die from a balloon stunt.
[28:35.260 --> 28:37.080]  We're also losing health insurance soon.
[28:37.180 --> 28:38.380]  What? So what is the risk?
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.920]  Are you worried about the balloon sucking, getting stuck over the air hole?
[28:45.440 --> 28:46.500]  We are. Yes. Yes.
[28:46.560 --> 28:47.680]  Nothing has changed.
[28:47.920 --> 28:50.260]  Nothing has changed from what has happened originally.
[28:50.580 --> 28:51.660]  Do you think that I couldn't?
[28:52.180 --> 28:52.560]  Yes.
[28:53.980 --> 28:55.440]  Do you think if I popped a balloon?
[28:55.680 --> 28:56.520]  And then that's the end.
[28:56.520 --> 28:58.360]  That's the end. I think you couldn't.
[28:58.500 --> 28:59.220]  That's the end.
[29:01.460 --> 29:02.780]  Oh, so that's it.
[29:03.500 --> 29:04.540]  Well, it's fat because it's a.
[29:07.040 --> 29:08.880]  It looks like you're fighting it.
[29:09.360 --> 29:10.500]  I was a fighting desk.
[29:10.680 --> 29:13.800]  It's a it's like doom and first person punching that desk.
[29:13.820 --> 29:14.780]  I fucking, yeah!
[29:15.300 --> 29:16.120]  The food!
[29:19.560 --> 29:21.360]  But as you see, it's it's multiple.
[29:21.560 --> 29:24.840]  You get a context of width with the Xbox games.
[29:24.840 --> 29:27.460]  That's a that's a great picture.
[29:35.060 --> 29:38.360]  Wait, so let me go back to your clamp from this Erwin clamp.
[29:38.680 --> 29:40.240]  Where do I strap the mic in?
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.320]  Oh, I don't know. Yeah.
[29:42.360 --> 29:45.440]  I wasn't I wasn't going to bring it up, but you're a hundred.
[29:45.540 --> 29:47.660]  Andrew, you're 100% right in this whole situation.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.500]  There's all kinds of different kinds of clamps.
[29:49.540 --> 29:51.040]  I'm just saying, I've looked at them.
[29:51.160 --> 29:52.060]  You can't find one.
[29:52.120 --> 29:53.500]  You said you'd find one that would work.
[29:53.500 --> 29:56.640]  Go to Uline and Google giant clamp.
[29:56.800 --> 29:57.860]  I'm sure one of them will work.
[29:58.140 --> 29:59.520]  I'm going to go. Why are you?
[29:59.760 --> 30:01.700]  No, stop for a second.
[30:01.920 --> 30:04.700]  You just claimed you could easily do this or that you could do this.
[30:04.780 --> 30:08.080]  And then I challenge you and your response is go to a website and find it.
[30:08.220 --> 30:09.420]  I've done the research.
[30:09.600 --> 30:11.840]  I've looked. I'm telling you there isn't.
[30:11.920 --> 30:14.140]  You're the one you're in the party that thinks there is.
[30:14.340 --> 30:15.960]  It is on you to find one.
[30:16.260 --> 30:18.280]  It is not on me to redo my research.
[30:18.740 --> 30:22.000]  OK, send me a picture of what I need to clamp and how it needs to look.
[30:22.040 --> 30:22.820]  And I'll find a solution.
[30:23.340 --> 30:24.300]  OK, I'm having trouble.
[30:24.360 --> 30:26.580]  I'm having trouble visualizing what I'm looking at.
[30:26.960 --> 30:29.500]  The the clamp that I went to and get my biggest clamp.
[30:29.580 --> 30:30.900]  That definitely would be too small.
[30:31.700 --> 30:32.800]  That's what I'm looking at.
[30:32.960 --> 30:34.840]  I've looked at them. They're all too small.
[30:35.400 --> 30:38.360]  I'm going to need I'm going to need detailed photos so I can fix this for you.
[30:38.760 --> 30:39.160]  Here's what you do.
[30:39.480 --> 30:41.220]  See that drawer? Yeah.
[30:41.620 --> 30:42.640]  Get rid of it.
[30:42.640 --> 30:44.400]  Tried. I've done that. I've tried that.
[30:44.760 --> 30:46.020]  You've tried to remove the drawer.
[30:46.640 --> 30:47.320]  Here's the problem.
[30:47.580 --> 30:48.500]  I've removed the drawer.
[30:48.900 --> 30:51.080]  Yeah, the thickness of the clamp.
[30:51.900 --> 30:54.980]  Is larger than the inside of the drawer.
[30:55.340 --> 30:59.120]  I can't fit the clamp in the drawer.
[30:59.560 --> 31:00.180]  It is too.
[31:00.540 --> 31:02.460]  The drawer itself is too small.
[31:03.280 --> 31:03.980]  Here's an idea.
[31:06.580 --> 31:07.720]  Here's an idea.
[31:08.900 --> 31:09.720]  Hold on just a second.
[31:10.220 --> 31:11.580]  What if you got.
[31:12.300 --> 31:13.880]  My problem solvers on this podcast.
[31:14.080 --> 31:15.060]  A bench vice.
[31:15.060 --> 31:20.260]  Oh, you screw that into the top and then you can clamp anything.
[31:20.800 --> 31:22.780]  The top looks kind of like glass, though.
[31:22.820 --> 31:23.500]  What is on the top?
[31:24.240 --> 31:24.980]  What is that?
[31:25.940 --> 31:26.800]  It's like a red.
[31:28.200 --> 31:30.220]  It's like a red car thing.
[31:30.860 --> 31:32.220]  It's a vice. It's screw.
[31:32.320 --> 31:34.420]  You screw it in a red car.
[31:34.620 --> 31:35.340]  Is that what you said?
[31:35.500 --> 31:40.760]  No, I said like that's I feel like you'd see that in a mechanical workshop.
[31:41.220 --> 31:42.660]  It's just for holding something.
[31:43.300 --> 31:44.180]  Yeah, it's just to hold shit.
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.680]  I just I've seen casino and it didn't look like that.
[31:47.760 --> 31:49.980]  The red, the bright red really threw me.
[31:50.480 --> 31:54.260]  There's all kinds of there's all kinds of weird clamps that I bet would do shit
[31:54.260 --> 31:56.520]  like you can do all kinds of stuff with that thing.
[31:59.120 --> 32:02.940]  And I mean, your desk is so big that it shouldn't be a problem
[32:02.940 --> 32:06.440]  that this thing is the size of a 15 pound weight, you know?
[32:06.480 --> 32:07.320]  So it should be fine.
[32:07.940 --> 32:09.520]  That's a plate right there, man. Easy.
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.900]  You can also just get a desk stand for Mike.
[32:12.440 --> 32:13.560]  Oh, it's too heavy.
[32:14.460 --> 32:15.700]  The arm is too heavy.
[32:16.980 --> 32:18.380]  Well, get rid of the arm.
[32:18.880 --> 32:20.600]  Why don't? Well, I like the arm.
[32:21.280 --> 32:22.680]  Why am I getting rid of the arm?
[32:24.080 --> 32:26.480]  This is my this is my favorite podcast.
[32:29.160 --> 32:33.880]  We're coming up for solutions for a guy who doesn't want them.
[32:35.780 --> 32:37.300]  I desperately want them.
[32:37.980 --> 32:39.660]  I'm going to need to see your set.
[32:39.660 --> 32:41.980]  I'm sending you my set right now.
[32:42.020 --> 32:43.260]  I'm sending it to you right now.
[32:43.380 --> 32:44.140]  I got an image.
[32:44.700 --> 32:46.500]  I'm not looking. I don't need it to be aggressive.
[32:46.640 --> 32:48.140]  I'm just saying at some point I need to see it.
[32:48.240 --> 32:50.460]  And then that way I can help find a solution.
[32:51.020 --> 32:52.320]  It's going to be right here.
[32:52.740 --> 32:53.200]  There you go.
[32:54.560 --> 32:55.280]  There it is.
[32:55.400 --> 32:56.620]  That's what I'm dealing with.
[32:57.300 --> 32:58.580]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[32:59.120 --> 33:02.040]  So I've looked at the on desk options.
[33:02.320 --> 33:03.160]  That might still work.
[33:03.540 --> 33:04.180]  How about this? Right.
[33:04.700 --> 33:07.940]  See the like conical part, the actual clamp part, the cone.
[33:07.940 --> 33:09.820]  Yeah. Get rid of that.
[33:10.300 --> 33:11.160]  Yeah. OK.
[33:11.280 --> 33:15.720]  Hole. Drill a hole in the desk and then stick the thing that's in that cone
[33:15.720 --> 33:17.660]  in the hole. Yeah.
[33:18.340 --> 33:19.180]  I need a drill.
[33:20.340 --> 33:22.560]  Well, you're going to need that anyway to drill a hole for the vice.
[33:25.160 --> 33:28.340]  Yeah, it's the biggest hurdle is that I would need a drill.
[33:28.960 --> 33:30.980]  Well, how do you how do you make a hole currently?
[33:32.680 --> 33:34.880]  I haven't needed to make a hole in a while.
[33:34.960 --> 33:36.100]  I guess typically a shovel.
[33:37.960 --> 33:39.240]  A metal in the wall.
[33:40.160 --> 33:41.500]  Do you? Well, hold on.
[33:41.600 --> 33:42.600]  Do you have a shovel? And a hammer?
[33:43.960 --> 33:46.660]  Maybe with a hammer for a wall.
[33:47.520 --> 33:48.940]  Like to like.
[33:49.560 --> 33:50.940]  I can't remember the last time.
[33:51.060 --> 33:51.500]  No, I agree.
[33:51.900 --> 33:53.380]  Andrew, I'm with you. Get a shovel.
[33:53.860 --> 33:56.860]  Like if you wanted to drill into a stud, like hang something on a stud,
[33:56.960 --> 33:58.260]  something of weight, like a shelf.
[33:58.640 --> 33:59.900]  How do you do that with a shovel?
[34:00.360 --> 34:03.440]  I'm taping that fucking thing through the wall.
[34:04.400 --> 34:05.460]  Are you kidding me?
[34:05.940 --> 34:07.820]  I'm getting I'm getting that wall
[34:07.820 --> 34:10.240]  tape. That's what I'm doing.
[34:10.900 --> 34:11.640]  Wall tape and Velcro.
[34:12.080 --> 34:13.700]  Yeah. Well, not Velcro.
[34:13.840 --> 34:17.880]  And Velcro, you'll see that sticky wall stuff you could use.
[34:18.220 --> 34:20.220]  I bet we could get you a new desk.
[34:20.840 --> 34:22.100]  No, my desk is great.
[34:22.460 --> 34:23.080]  I don't need a desk.
[34:23.080 --> 34:23.620]  You just need a different.
[34:23.800 --> 34:25.220]  You just need a different way of fixing it. This is what I was thinking.
[34:25.400 --> 34:26.560]  It goes with that Rode mic arm.
[34:26.700 --> 34:27.160]  That's all you need.
[34:27.160 --> 34:27.760]  This is my solution.
[34:28.040 --> 34:29.420]  This is my Velcro solution.
[34:29.940 --> 34:32.480]  I'm thinking about getting a small piece of wood,
[34:32.640 --> 34:34.700]  like a square piece of wood,
[34:34.700 --> 34:38.200]  and just nailing that to the corner of my desk
[34:38.600 --> 34:40.900]  and then having the clamp attached to the wood.
[34:41.220 --> 34:42.200]  That's a great idea.
[34:43.600 --> 34:45.100]  I think that might be the fix.
[34:45.420 --> 34:46.760]  That's easier than drilling a hole.
[34:46.880 --> 34:50.540]  I mean, I have like an actual I have an actual solution, but I don't want to share it.
[34:50.880 --> 34:52.020]  No, I mean, like you're good.
[34:52.180 --> 34:53.100]  It seems like you're good.
[34:53.180 --> 34:55.460]  It seems like you just should get a piece of wood and you got it.
[34:55.820 --> 34:58.020]  I agree. I'd love to hear what your solution is.
[34:58.340 --> 35:01.620]  It's just this other compatible Rode arm that you drill into your desk.
[35:01.620 --> 35:05.560]  Once the once again, once again, you can't drill a situation.
[35:05.740 --> 35:06.820]  We'll just get a shovel.
[35:09.790 --> 35:10.670]  Here's what you do.
[35:11.030 --> 35:13.210]  You take the drawer out, right?
[35:13.710 --> 35:17.730]  Then on it, the piece of wood that supports the drawer
[35:18.290 --> 35:20.030]  stops it from falling down off the ground.
[35:20.670 --> 35:21.410]  Get rid of that, too.
[35:22.190 --> 35:26.230]  There's a piece like the bottom of the the bit behind your little finger.
[35:26.890 --> 35:29.190]  OK. OK.
[35:30.030 --> 35:31.530]  Yeah. And then clamp it on.
[35:32.310 --> 35:34.430]  I'll I don't listen.
[35:34.530 --> 35:36.910]  I've done this. I've tried a lot of things. I'll try it again.
[35:37.450 --> 35:38.390]  I don't think it works.
[35:39.970 --> 35:43.150]  Well, on the bright side, I've heard at least three different ways
[35:43.150 --> 35:44.530]  to make this work now.
[35:44.610 --> 35:47.550]  I think the nail with the wood is probably the best.
[35:48.230 --> 35:49.330]  I you know what? I agree.
[35:49.410 --> 35:52.190]  I retract my idea and I'm going to go with.
[35:52.370 --> 35:53.190]  I just don't have a drill.
[35:53.610 --> 35:56.010]  No, no, I do. A hundred percent.
[35:56.150 --> 35:57.570]  Yeah. You should do a drill.
[35:58.070 --> 35:59.570]  Do you know? No, no, no.
[35:59.570 --> 36:01.910]  Get the piece of nickel, send you a piece of wood.
[36:02.730 --> 36:04.610]  Now, hold on. Do you have a piece of wood?
[36:05.350 --> 36:07.110]  No. Do you have a nail?
[36:08.370 --> 36:10.310]  Probably. I could probably find a nail.
[36:11.090 --> 36:12.230]  OK, do you have a hammer?
[36:13.390 --> 36:15.490]  Duh, yeah, absolutely.
[36:16.070 --> 36:18.670]  Cheaper to buy a piece of wood than it is to buy a drill.
[36:18.690 --> 36:19.530]  So go with that solution.
[36:19.950 --> 36:24.130]  I feel like I could just go to like Home Depot and buy a two by four and say,
[36:24.230 --> 36:27.550]  can you cut this to be a two by three?
[36:28.090 --> 36:29.310]  Absolutely. Yeah.
[36:29.310 --> 36:31.230]  And that's definitely a thing you're going to do.
[36:31.350 --> 36:31.950]  Yeah, a hundred percent.
[36:32.470 --> 36:33.430]  Yeah. Here's the thing, Andrew.
[36:33.910 --> 36:36.270]  You need a drill. For what?
[36:36.450 --> 36:38.710]  It's just life. Future. The future.
[36:41.050 --> 36:41.830]  Strongly disagree.
[36:42.470 --> 36:44.130]  You know, you don't ever need a drill.
[36:44.910 --> 36:47.630]  I mean, I've gone almost 30 years without needing one.
[36:47.750 --> 36:48.930]  I don't. I don't listen.
[36:49.530 --> 36:52.250]  Here's here's the fear about Andrew getting a drill.
[36:52.810 --> 36:54.390]  You've just given Andrew a drill.
[36:56.790 --> 36:57.790]  You know what I mean?
[36:57.790 --> 37:02.510]  Now suddenly now suddenly like what is it when when all you have is a hammer,
[37:02.670 --> 37:04.110]  all the world's problems looking like a nail.
[37:06.410 --> 37:09.810]  You've just everything's going to look like a drillable problems
[37:09.810 --> 37:12.670]  or every problem is going to have a drillable solution.
[37:12.930 --> 37:16.370]  You do need to think of it as that, like I'm a character in a video game
[37:16.370 --> 37:17.830]  and you've given me a new tool.
[37:18.030 --> 37:23.110]  Yeah. And now every problem I encounter, the drill will be a consideration for.
[37:23.310 --> 37:25.050]  Yeah. Fixing that problem.
[37:25.050 --> 37:27.670]  You'll have a whisk lodged up in Milwaukee.
[37:28.210 --> 37:30.190]  What did I buy a staple gun for?
[37:30.470 --> 37:32.290]  I bought a staple gun for like, we're going to have to
[37:32.290 --> 37:35.810]  we're going to have to explain to Andrew why he can't drill through a mirror.
[37:38.850 --> 37:41.370]  I bought a staple gun when I was doing the sleep spaghetti.
[37:41.630 --> 37:42.710]  That's why I bought a staple gun.
[37:43.190 --> 37:45.710]  Oh, what? I didn't work a fucking sentence.
[37:45.990 --> 37:47.290]  What a goddamn sentence.
[37:47.630 --> 37:50.270]  Do you think you think this you think you could staple the
[37:51.170 --> 37:52.770]  the two by four to your desk?
[37:52.770 --> 37:54.710]  Or is no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:54.770 --> 37:58.370]  I'm just going to fucking nail that fucking thing into my desk and make it sturdy.
[37:58.850 --> 38:00.130]  Yeah, I'm excited.
[38:00.250 --> 38:01.970]  I think you should try this for the next recording.
[38:02.590 --> 38:05.090]  No, I'm not. I was going to I got to.
[38:05.770 --> 38:08.110]  Now go to get one piece of wood.
[38:08.270 --> 38:09.870]  Oh, wait, no, there'll be a break.
[38:10.050 --> 38:11.590]  Never mind. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Yeah.
[38:12.150 --> 38:14.890]  Because this is a Friday and then we're not recording a show next week.
[38:14.970 --> 38:16.430]  This could. Yeah, yeah.
[38:17.350 --> 38:20.250]  Done it anyway. But yeah, that that gives you
[38:20.250 --> 38:24.730]  that it gives you arguably just about 14 days to acquire one piece of wood.
[38:24.970 --> 38:26.750]  That seems like a doable adventure.
[38:27.530 --> 38:29.230]  Yeah, let's see. I mean, Home Depot.
[38:30.830 --> 38:32.150]  This is the best.
[38:32.370 --> 38:36.530]  This is the you might even have a local hardware store closer than Home Depot.
[38:36.730 --> 38:39.070]  Home Hardware is closer, but I.
[38:39.190 --> 38:39.650]  There you go.
[38:40.330 --> 38:41.690]  Tractor supply or whatnot.
[38:41.810 --> 38:42.810]  The main brand.
[38:43.350 --> 38:44.530]  Well, you know, you don't need to.
[38:44.590 --> 38:45.590]  Andrew, can I just say right now?
[38:46.050 --> 38:48.770]  I'm going to stop you right now as a as a as a former homeowner,
[38:48.770 --> 38:50.130]  a three time homeowner.
[38:50.290 --> 38:51.450]  You don't need name brand wood.
[38:51.890 --> 38:52.470]  You just need wood.
[38:53.170 --> 38:54.730]  Yeah, wood to me is all the same.
[38:54.790 --> 38:58.930]  I meant the like the business of buying it from apply.
[38:59.110 --> 39:00.790]  You definitely want to support a mega corporation.
[39:01.230 --> 39:04.630]  Never mind. Can I can I propose that?
[39:04.710 --> 39:07.070]  Like, if you go like you're going to get the wood and everything
[39:07.070 --> 39:10.650]  and like just inspiration strikes you, I kind of want you to just like
[39:10.650 --> 39:11.610]  follow that thread.
[39:12.210 --> 39:16.130]  Yeah, you you might be surprised just walking through the hand tool
[39:16.130 --> 39:17.210]  and woodworking section.
[39:17.250 --> 39:21.210]  Geoff starts seeing all the different clamps and things they got going on in there.
[39:21.290 --> 39:22.510]  Will you see a vice in person?
[39:22.850 --> 39:24.770]  You might. Yeah.
[39:25.130 --> 39:26.590]  Inspiration may strike. Yeah.
[39:28.070 --> 39:30.370]  Forty eight, you might you might see one in person and go,
[39:30.490 --> 39:33.210]  this is a cool red car and I got to have it.
[39:34.810 --> 39:36.610]  This is better. 1498.
[39:36.950 --> 39:40.490]  While he's doing that, Eric, explain to me how Geoff could.
[39:40.650 --> 39:42.650]  OK, the balloon is popped to Geoff's mouth, right?
[39:42.750 --> 39:44.650]  I don't understand what you don't get about it.
[39:44.650 --> 39:46.610]  It's that it's that you breathe it in.
[39:46.750 --> 39:47.830]  There's a shock.
[39:47.970 --> 39:51.710]  And you go as the thing explodes and it goes in your throat
[39:51.710 --> 39:54.730]  and we have to fish it out and we don't in time and you die.
[39:55.630 --> 39:58.830]  Yeah, you don't think I could fish out rubber from Geoff's throat?
[39:58.990 --> 40:00.770]  No, no, not quick enough.
[40:01.350 --> 40:02.390]  It's not going to pop.
[40:04.270 --> 40:07.890]  One inch by 24 inches.
[40:08.850 --> 40:10.970]  What if it was a cellophane bag?
[40:11.830 --> 40:12.810]  How is that better?
[40:12.810 --> 40:14.010]  I don't know.
[40:21.570 --> 40:24.970]  This is like that time when Gavin was convinced
[40:24.970 --> 40:27.950]  that it was safe to put coke and Mentos in his own butthole
[40:27.950 --> 40:31.090]  and shoot it out with a funnel, and then we watched a video and discovered
[40:31.090 --> 40:32.930]  it's not and people get hurt.
[40:33.230 --> 40:33.910]  We can't do that.
[40:34.550 --> 40:36.650]  I don't care mostly about people getting hurt.
[40:36.770 --> 40:38.990]  It's the dying thing that like really
[40:39.750 --> 40:41.970]  because I'll be on the hook for it and I don't want that.
[40:42.690 --> 40:43.290]  That's fair.
[40:43.930 --> 40:45.490]  Nobody wants to be on the hook for death.
[40:45.990 --> 40:47.530]  How else can we? OK, what about this?
[40:47.910 --> 40:50.370]  We see who can hold the most water in their mouth
[40:50.370 --> 40:53.570]  and then gauze the water into a cup and we take the measurement that way.
[40:53.790 --> 40:55.250]  I like that. That's great.
[40:55.510 --> 40:56.890]  I'm totally fine. I think that's great.
[40:57.170 --> 40:57.790]  I think it's fantastic.
[40:58.050 --> 40:59.250]  And that's the throat goat.
[41:01.190 --> 41:02.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:02.610 --> 41:06.290]  Nick doesn't sound like he's in, but I feel like on the day of he will be.
[41:06.390 --> 41:07.010]  Yeah, probably.
[41:08.010 --> 41:09.750]  So we'll all just sit around a table
[41:09.750 --> 41:13.090]  and gauze into like a Pyrex and see who wins.
[41:13.510 --> 41:14.290]  Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[41:14.750 --> 41:15.670]  I think that's a good idea.
[41:15.750 --> 41:18.310]  Well, I think it should probably be colored liquid so that way we can like
[41:18.310 --> 41:22.070]  like visually we want it to be stunning and we should all have different colors.
[41:22.250 --> 41:23.310]  Like I can be green.
[41:23.890 --> 41:26.090]  You can be red, like that kind of thing.
[41:26.430 --> 41:26.970]  Andrew, are you in?
[41:27.910 --> 41:28.570]  Mm hmm.
[41:29.190 --> 41:30.150]  He's still looking at wood.
[41:30.570 --> 41:32.290]  He's like, I think he's doing it.
[41:32.290 --> 41:34.110]  He's trying to see how much water he can fit in his mouth.
[41:36.390 --> 41:38.910]  Do you have like a way of measuring the water?
[41:39.750 --> 41:40.010]  Mm hmm.
[41:42.770 --> 41:44.350]  It's fucking moldy.
[41:44.450 --> 41:45.130]  Jesus Christ.
[41:45.370 --> 41:46.570]  This is the best.
[41:46.650 --> 41:48.410]  This is the best show in the world.
[41:48.750 --> 41:50.210]  Why? Why are you holding it?
[41:50.370 --> 41:51.470]  You don't need to.
[41:52.190 --> 41:53.730]  You're not going to make any more.
[41:53.950 --> 41:55.950]  If anything, you're going to lose it the longer you hold it.
[41:56.870 --> 41:59.670]  Holding it, holding it in makes absolutely no fucking sense.
[42:00.590 --> 42:01.730]  I mean, no, the problem.
[42:02.090 --> 42:05.330]  The problem was I didn't realize the thing I was going to spit it into had water
[42:05.330 --> 42:05.930]  in it already.
[42:06.290 --> 42:07.550]  It was a real conundrum.
[42:07.770 --> 42:08.370]  What do I do?
[42:08.730 --> 42:11.270]  That's a real diehard three problem right there.
[42:12.390 --> 42:16.290]  Yeah, I guess, you know, you're about to spit it into a cup full of toothpaste water.
[42:17.070 --> 42:19.010]  I mean, I just spit it out.
[42:19.450 --> 42:22.210]  I, uh, I don't know how to measure this.
[42:22.290 --> 42:23.690]  I don't really know what I accomplished here.
[42:26.790 --> 42:28.810]  I don't even know how big this cup is.
[42:28.910 --> 42:30.190]  I don't even have a context.
[42:31.490 --> 42:33.050]  Anyway, I'm getting my reps in.
[42:33.130 --> 42:33.750]  I'm getting practice.
[42:33.910 --> 42:34.830]  I know some technique.
[42:34.950 --> 42:37.330]  Yeah. Maybe we can incorporate the Gerpless somehow.
[42:37.830 --> 42:39.570]  That's what I drank it out of.
[42:39.710 --> 42:41.590]  I had a Gerpler on my pants, that's why I was like...
[42:41.590 --> 42:48.450]  What if the new Gerpler has lines on it for like the Throat Goat Gerpler?
[42:49.650 --> 42:50.810]  Oh, that's interesting.
[42:51.270 --> 42:55.610]  OK, what if each of the lines is how much liquid we all hold?
[42:55.750 --> 42:59.330]  So that way you can know if you hold more than Nick, but less than Eric.
[42:59.330 --> 42:59.950]  That's a great idea.
[43:00.110 --> 43:02.130]  And Nick just said the Throatler.
[43:02.570 --> 43:03.770]  The Throatler.
[43:04.130 --> 43:06.370]  Yeah, you can measure your throat to our throats.
[43:06.370 --> 43:07.510]  I love this.
[43:07.990 --> 43:09.330]  A regulation Throatler.
[43:10.350 --> 43:11.670]  I want to be the...
[43:12.290 --> 43:15.930]  This has nothing to do with throats, by the way, which I think makes it especially funny.
[43:16.430 --> 43:18.310]  Well, yeah, but it's funny.
[43:18.370 --> 43:19.170]  It gives all cheeks.
[43:19.790 --> 43:21.710]  Yeah, it's really like the cheek goat.
[43:22.070 --> 43:22.270]  Yeah.
[43:22.750 --> 43:24.490]  Well, think of it like this way.
[43:24.530 --> 43:28.370]  The throat is like the table leg of the mouth.
[43:29.310 --> 43:34.030]  So you have to have a strong throat to support all the water that goes into your mouth.
[43:34.030 --> 43:34.910]  They're all connected.
[43:38.090 --> 43:47.350]  Speaking of throats, I was at the pharmacy the other day and I looked at this poster and I just was just cracking up because I'm an immature moron.
[43:47.550 --> 43:52.430]  I was just imagining that scene in The Matrix, but Morpheus has two spoons instead of two pills.
[43:55.470 --> 43:59.290]  Imagine the reflection in his glasses, he's just holding up two spoons of liquid.
[43:59.290 --> 44:02.150]  He's like, you take the day quill or the night quill?
[44:04.430 --> 44:07.090]  And I had to explain to the pharmacist why I was laughing.
[44:08.950 --> 44:09.710]  It's so funny.
[44:10.010 --> 44:15.010]  I mean, I mean, I mean, the hard part, Gavin, the hard part is there is no spoon.
[44:15.230 --> 44:16.170]  There is no spoon.
[44:16.570 --> 44:18.990]  I mean, they should have done it because it's a spoon heavy movie.
[44:21.850 --> 44:25.210]  Hey, I have a I have a cultural idea, multicultural idea.
[44:25.450 --> 44:26.130]  I want to run by you guys.
[44:26.370 --> 44:33.430]  I was watching a TikTok the other day and it was of a British person at a high school football game, like in America, and going like,
[44:33.430 --> 44:34.830]  I can't believe this shit is real.
[44:35.050 --> 44:37.770]  I just I really, genuinely thought there was only stuff you see in the movies.
[44:38.010 --> 44:41.450]  Do people really have like high school football games every Friday night all across America?
[44:41.990 --> 44:43.510]  And I thought that was kind of funny.
[44:43.950 --> 44:47.750]  And I was thinking about how, Gavin, you've lived in America for a very long time now.
[44:48.310 --> 44:53.250]  And I wonder how much like American stuff you've done versus haven't done.
[44:53.490 --> 45:00.010]  And then that got me thinking about what would be the most if you just wanted to design a day and just say,
[45:00.010 --> 45:07.210]  I'm going to give somebody the full American, like the most American day from like breakfast to when you go to bed at night.
[45:07.290 --> 45:08.550]  What are those activities?
[45:08.830 --> 45:09.770]  And then it hit me.
[45:09.850 --> 45:15.490]  We have a Brit and a Canadian, so we could have we could each design the full American day,
[45:15.570 --> 45:23.510]  the full British day and the full Canadian day as like this is like what a regulation like top tier Canadian day is.
[45:23.550 --> 45:26.830]  If you want to you want to absorb Canada in one day period, this is what it is.
[45:27.050 --> 45:28.070]  UK, America.
[45:28.290 --> 45:28.890]  What do you guys think about that?
[45:29.150 --> 45:29.610]  I love it.
[45:29.610 --> 45:31.630]  Like the British gauntlet.
[45:32.330 --> 45:33.450]  Yeah, like the British gauntlet.
[45:33.570 --> 45:38.110]  Yeah, it's like you start with a full English and then you do, I don't know, high tea at some point, right?
[45:38.170 --> 45:39.970]  And then you probably there's probably something else involved.
[45:40.150 --> 45:42.170]  Then pop up the hill for some cheese rolly.
[45:42.290 --> 45:45.210]  Yeah, you do something else with your I assume British people do something else, right?
[45:45.270 --> 45:49.330]  You'd collect spoons and watch a watch the Queen.
[45:49.430 --> 45:55.550]  I imagine the American day is and then you fire your gun in the air and then you go to the next thing and then you fire your gun in the air.
[45:55.610 --> 45:57.530]  Like it's Yosemite Sam is what I'm imagining.
[45:57.530 --> 46:01.030]  I wouldn't I would probably probably involve a rodeo.
[46:01.250 --> 46:06.610]  Honestly, I was yeah, firing guns in a rodeo, like not at the same time.
[46:06.690 --> 46:08.910]  But those two activities, I think, would both be in there.
[46:09.190 --> 46:13.910]  Be some let be like intertubing on a like on a swampy creek or lake somewhere.
[46:14.150 --> 46:15.950]  There'd be definitely hot dogs.
[46:16.070 --> 46:17.070]  There'd be fireworks.
[46:17.370 --> 46:20.350]  I was talking the other day about how I thought lacrosse was fictional.
[46:20.650 --> 46:22.810]  And just for the movie, that's right.
[46:23.330 --> 46:24.870]  Realize it was a real thing.
[46:25.110 --> 46:26.270]  It looks so made up.
[46:26.270 --> 46:30.750]  Can you imagine creating something so lame as lacrosse?
[46:30.950 --> 46:32.810]  Just visually? Yeah, just visually.
[46:33.270 --> 46:37.790]  Like if you're going to make a fake sport, I'm not saying lacrosse within the context of reality is lame,
[46:37.810 --> 46:44.030]  but in a world in which you're inventing a sport for a film, the best you can do is lacrosse.
[46:44.650 --> 46:46.310]  What a lame thing to come up with.
[46:46.830 --> 46:48.630]  I agree. I agree with you.
[46:48.790 --> 46:51.590]  It is like looking at it.
[46:51.690 --> 46:55.410]  It's like what if Quidditch was worse and everyone just ran around
[46:55.870 --> 46:59.990]  like it's just so it's hockey for dudes who can't skate.
[47:00.190 --> 47:05.830]  The thing that I love the most about this conversation is that for the last year
[47:05.830 --> 47:09.830]  I was in the Army, I was the I was the press agent, the one man press office
[47:09.830 --> 47:13.010]  for the United States Military Academy's preparatory school in New Jersey.
[47:13.010 --> 47:17.210]  And they had a lacrosse team and they would scrimmage
[47:17.210 --> 47:19.430]  against the West Point lacrosse team back and forth.
[47:19.890 --> 47:25.190]  And I've never seen people with a bigger chip on their shoulder in life
[47:25.190 --> 47:28.830]  than lacrosse players like they wake up every day angry
[47:28.830 --> 47:32.250]  that the world doesn't respect their sport and understand it.
[47:32.430 --> 47:35.150]  And they go to bed every night wanting to fight somebody over it.
[47:35.410 --> 47:37.630]  Like that. That is a group of people you don't want to piss off
[47:37.630 --> 47:42.330]  because they are they are itching to prove to you that lacrosse is a tough guy sport.
[47:42.930 --> 47:45.330]  I I don't doubt that it's a tough guy sport.
[47:45.570 --> 47:50.250]  I think the problem is that there's no like the exciting moments stuff
[47:50.250 --> 47:53.130]  isn't very exciting, like there's no odds.
[47:53.710 --> 47:55.110]  I'm not defending it at all.
[47:55.110 --> 47:56.130]  I totally agree with you.
[47:56.190 --> 47:57.830]  I'm just saying that's a bunch of people that just are.
[47:58.130 --> 48:02.270]  I've met that as a rule, as generally are just angry about how people view their sport.
[48:02.590 --> 48:05.990]  I feel like the sport would be much more interesting if the ball glowed.
[48:06.010 --> 48:07.670]  I feel like it's too small to see.
[48:08.030 --> 48:09.530]  Yeah, something like that. That's good.
[48:10.290 --> 48:13.950]  And I don't mean this to be rude to people we know that play the other sports.
[48:14.450 --> 48:17.190]  But lacrosse and ultimate are like the same kind of thing to me,
[48:17.350 --> 48:21.570]  where it's just like it's really it's really hard to look at it and get excited,
[48:21.730 --> 48:22.410]  I guess. Yeah.
[48:22.410 --> 48:26.310]  I had to I had to photograph a lot of lacrosse game matches in the army.
[48:26.410 --> 48:27.250]  And yeah, it's just.
[48:28.050 --> 48:29.550]  I'm right there with you. It didn't do it for me.
[48:29.610 --> 48:31.310]  But I also recognize that those dudes are like,
[48:31.370 --> 48:33.050]  I wouldn't say that to a lacrosse player's face
[48:33.050 --> 48:35.930]  because they either yell at you for an hour or fight you.
[48:36.390 --> 48:41.150]  Is there a sport that would be lessened by having the ball glow?
[48:41.250 --> 48:43.850]  I feel like the ball glowing would improve every sport.
[48:45.310 --> 48:46.370]  That'd be fucking awesome.
[48:48.190 --> 48:50.710]  I feel like it I feel like it works for sports where the ball is small,
[48:50.710 --> 48:52.110]  like tennis, it would help out.
[48:52.890 --> 48:56.070]  No, I want to see like on a on a like a soccer kick,
[48:56.190 --> 48:59.010]  like a Rocket League like tail, you know, like when you boost.
[48:59.210 --> 49:00.350]  Yeah, I love that on the ball.
[49:00.770 --> 49:01.650]  This is awesome.
[49:03.390 --> 49:05.410]  Or if like golf balls really did the thing
[49:05.410 --> 49:07.930]  where if you watch golf or like they do the tail on it,
[49:07.950 --> 49:11.730]  like if that was just a natural occurring process of hitting the ball.
[49:12.190 --> 49:15.730]  Like if you could have tracer rounds on golf balls like you do on bullets.
[49:17.270 --> 49:20.350]  Yes. Oh, man, I would be I would watch so much more golf.
[49:21.290 --> 49:23.650]  Every every time you hit a golf ball, it's like
[49:24.950 --> 49:28.470]  even on like a smaller scale, like a pinball machine with that pinballs
[49:28.470 --> 49:31.310]  with that flying around. Oh.
[49:32.210 --> 49:35.030]  Yeah. Every sport would be improved.
[49:35.650 --> 49:38.350]  What sport would be improved by going the opposite direction
[49:38.350 --> 49:40.030]  and making the ball harder to see?
[49:41.070 --> 49:42.770]  Football. Dodgeball.
[49:43.550 --> 49:47.370]  If the dodgeball was like a mirror, like if you couldn't see it like it's.
[49:47.370 --> 49:50.970]  Yeah, if it's like a mirror like that, like that wavy invisibility
[49:50.970 --> 49:53.970]  cloaking technology we have now where it's mostly invisible,
[49:54.090 --> 49:55.650]  but you kind of get a shimmer, you know.
[49:56.070 --> 49:59.270]  Well, all the people that are polishing their Cybertrucks to a mirror finish,
[50:00.810 --> 50:04.450]  not realizing that it makes their car just completely invisible.
[50:05.790 --> 50:07.990]  The people are going to be going around a corner
[50:07.990 --> 50:11.430]  and then driving into their own car before they realize what's happened.
[50:14.070 --> 50:17.050]  It would be funny to like test with each sport
[50:17.050 --> 50:20.830]  what what size of ball makes it unplayable both ways.
[50:21.590 --> 50:24.390]  At what point does it being too small make it impossible?
[50:24.590 --> 50:26.130]  And what point does it being so big?
[50:26.270 --> 50:28.430]  It just you can't you can't score.
[50:28.790 --> 50:32.550]  Like I think it's in my head, imagining like a rugby scrum
[50:32.550 --> 50:36.530]  where they can't see the ball and they're still scrumming like five yards away
[50:36.530 --> 50:37.910]  from where the ball actually is.
[50:38.030 --> 50:38.870]  Very funny.
[50:39.150 --> 50:42.130]  Or like if a basketball was the size of a medicine ball,
[50:42.150 --> 50:44.370]  but still bouncing shit like a basketball.
[50:45.250 --> 50:45.970]  I'd be dangerous.
[50:45.970 --> 50:47.790]  Yeah, are you?
[50:53.530 --> 50:55.330]  It would be pandemonium.
[50:55.390 --> 50:56.770]  You imagine getting hit with one of those?
[50:57.050 --> 50:58.070]  Jesus. Oh, terrible.
[50:58.250 --> 50:58.870]  Trying to miss it.
[50:58.950 --> 51:01.450]  Miss time in a rebound and hitting the fucking. Oh, God.
[51:02.750 --> 51:04.690]  What a way to protest Steph Curry.
[51:04.990 --> 51:08.090]  Just giving him a fucking boulder to try to shoot threes with.
[51:08.570 --> 51:10.010]  Just making it impossible.
[51:10.350 --> 51:12.410]  Just making it a literal boulder to throw.
[51:12.970 --> 51:14.310]  Bring back the dunk era.
[51:15.190 --> 51:16.330]  Everybody in the paint.
[51:17.030 --> 51:19.610]  I think tip of the shuttlecock glowing would be cool.
[51:19.930 --> 51:20.950]  That would be cool.
[51:21.490 --> 51:22.690]  I bet that exists.
[51:23.270 --> 51:24.010]  Yeah, but it does.
[51:24.090 --> 51:28.130]  What if you drove a Cybertruck into your wall and then use that to shave?
[51:28.910 --> 51:30.070]  Use the reflection.
[51:32.670 --> 51:35.650]  Dude, there are so many glow in the dark shuttlecocks.
[51:35.930 --> 51:36.510]  Wow. Yeah.
[51:36.550 --> 51:38.630]  But it looks like not the tip that glows.
[51:38.710 --> 51:40.030]  It looks like it's the whole thing.
[51:40.290 --> 51:40.650]  You're right.
[51:40.730 --> 51:43.990]  And then also it looks like it's the only part that doesn't glow is the tip.
[51:43.990 --> 51:44.810]  Is the tip. Yeah.
[51:45.610 --> 51:48.150]  Who do you think of of the regulation crew?
[51:48.910 --> 51:49.690]  That's great.
[51:50.030 --> 51:51.950]  Who do you think is the best badminton player?
[51:53.450 --> 51:57.110]  Me. Right now, I used to play all the time as a kid.
[51:57.510 --> 51:58.990]  Yeah, I was a pretty big player.
[51:59.550 --> 52:00.290]  Geoff says him.
[52:00.710 --> 52:03.830]  See, I'm thinking I could just wipe the floor with a lawyer.
[52:04.510 --> 52:05.230]  Oh, probably.
[52:05.610 --> 52:07.670]  Probably. This one has a glowing tip, right?
[52:07.810 --> 52:09.670]  There you go. That's what we're looking for.
[52:09.710 --> 52:13.210]  Because others, they glow on skirt, not hitting spot.
[52:13.390 --> 52:14.950]  And I agree. That's right. That's right.
[52:16.130 --> 52:17.610]  Should we have a badminton tournament?
[52:17.610 --> 52:18.770]  I think so.
[52:19.030 --> 52:23.370]  We can. I don't think it would be that hard to set up.
[52:23.650 --> 52:27.190]  Can can you play on like a regular volleyball net?
[52:27.330 --> 52:29.090]  Or does is it like a lower net? I don't remember.
[52:30.510 --> 52:31.210]  I think it's lower.
[52:31.670 --> 52:35.930]  I think we just buy a kit and throw it in the like, take it down to Zilker Park,
[52:36.030 --> 52:37.870]  probably, but it needs to be regulation height.
[52:38.450 --> 52:39.370]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:39.470 --> 52:42.430]  Walmart, you can get like a $20 kit pretty easily.
[52:42.830 --> 52:44.110]  OK. Yeah, yeah.
[52:44.730 --> 52:45.670]  It was good to know.
[52:46.090 --> 52:47.710]  Oh, 80 bucks. Here you go.
[52:47.770 --> 52:48.510]  Do we want to do doubles?
[52:48.610 --> 52:49.510]  Oh, that's more than I thought.
[52:49.870 --> 52:50.770]  Yeah, I think to be two.
[52:51.150 --> 52:53.010]  And then the winning team goes head to head.
[52:53.150 --> 52:54.010]  Like, that's how you do it.
[52:54.230 --> 52:55.770]  Oh, wow. Right.
[52:56.250 --> 52:56.930]  That's pretty good.
[52:56.930 --> 52:58.070]  I have to turn. That's great.
[52:58.150 --> 52:59.670]  So how are we filming the two V2?
[53:01.050 --> 53:04.390]  I, you know, tripod, I don't know, get a fucking piece of wood
[53:04.390 --> 53:06.830]  and nail it to a desk and put a hammer on it.
[53:07.510 --> 53:08.370]  Maybe a clamp.
[53:08.990 --> 53:12.390]  When all you got to hammer every solution, man, I get it.
[53:12.850 --> 53:14.730]  Yeah. Oh, dude.
[53:15.170 --> 53:18.170]  Uh, here's a here's a fucking awesome set up for this.
[53:19.470 --> 53:23.450]  I was pitching Eric, you guys doing like a summer video
[53:24.070 --> 53:27.310]  and this feels like it would fit in that very well. Yeah.
[53:27.710 --> 53:31.630]  It started with me wondering if you could fire condiments out of a super soaker.
[53:32.390 --> 53:36.290]  Is the idea of like Nick just walking around shooting condiments
[53:36.290 --> 53:38.110]  on like hot dogs is really funny to me.
[53:39.430 --> 53:41.370]  I like that idea and I want to follow through.
[53:41.450 --> 53:42.310]  I want to follow up on that.
[53:42.410 --> 53:43.290]  But I have a question.
[53:43.290 --> 53:44.410]  I have a question.
[53:44.910 --> 53:48.090]  Do you think you're a better badminton player in the daytime or at night?
[53:49.390 --> 53:50.750]  Because we can do it both ways.
[53:50.810 --> 53:52.510]  We we know they have the technology.
[53:53.470 --> 53:54.710]  Does the net light up?
[53:56.110 --> 53:57.750]  Yeah, they make it light up.
[53:57.890 --> 53:58.510]  Actually, they do.
[53:58.570 --> 54:00.230]  Can you get that glow in the dark paint?
[54:01.390 --> 54:04.310]  And then paint the field that way, the lines, because you have lines.
[54:04.830 --> 54:05.390]  Oh, yeah.
[54:05.430 --> 54:07.570]  We just rent some UV lights and make the most
[54:08.770 --> 54:11.410]  glowing badminton game the world's ever seen.
[54:11.410 --> 54:14.970]  Or you could just go to a park during the day and not do all that work
[54:14.970 --> 54:16.330]  and then set up a net and play.
[54:16.450 --> 54:17.390]  I think that's probably.
[54:17.650 --> 54:20.370]  I mean, either way, we're nailing wood to a desk to film it.
[54:20.850 --> 54:21.710]  Yeah, yeah.
[54:21.810 --> 54:22.890]  So that's easy. Look at that.
[54:23.730 --> 54:27.330]  Now, is there like a halftime shave break for this game?
[54:28.370 --> 54:29.430]  Yeah. Do you think you're
[54:29.430 --> 54:31.230]  do you think you're better with a beard or without?
[54:31.950 --> 54:32.890]  Oh, definitely without.
[54:33.370 --> 54:34.870]  Less weight, more air, move faster.
[54:35.210 --> 54:37.070]  Yeah, I like this.
[54:37.170 --> 54:41.170]  I think I think Gavin might be the best player.
[54:41.410 --> 54:44.030]  But I think Nick and Eric would be Geoff and Gavin.
[54:44.390 --> 54:46.310]  You think Nick and Eric are going to beat Gavin?
[54:46.490 --> 54:47.450]  And oh, fuck.
[54:47.570 --> 54:48.730]  I will say I should tell you this.
[54:48.770 --> 54:51.510]  I once lost miserably to Jack at tennis.
[54:52.030 --> 54:55.050]  Oh, OK. Well, that really shifts things a lot.
[54:55.590 --> 54:56.830]  But tennis is very different.
[54:57.390 --> 54:58.890]  Well, when? When was this?
[54:59.310 --> 55:00.990]  Oh, seven or eight years ago, maybe.
[55:01.610 --> 55:02.690]  Oh, OK. But never mind.
[55:02.730 --> 55:04.250]  I have shifted things a lot.
[55:04.550 --> 55:07.430]  Yeah. Now, Eric, is this going to be this is going to be face
[55:07.430 --> 55:10.070]  off season one is what I'm imagining at this point.
[55:10.550 --> 55:11.410]  Going to be Eric, Nick.
[55:12.310 --> 55:15.370]  And I think I think Nick will win.
[55:16.050 --> 55:17.410]  Oh, wow.
[55:17.550 --> 55:20.370]  Andrew's early predictions are that Nick takes it.
[55:20.510 --> 55:21.730]  OK. Fucked up, but hell yeah.
[55:23.070 --> 55:25.410]  I think Nick will want it more.
[55:25.550 --> 55:29.190]  I think ultimately, Eric won't care about winning in the same way Nick will.
[55:29.670 --> 55:33.790]  And the fact that you have a kid, Nick, I feel like just gives you an edge.
[55:34.210 --> 55:37.450]  I feel like you're probably running around more than Eric is just
[55:37.450 --> 55:39.950]  by nature of having a child.
[55:39.970 --> 55:44.030]  Yeah. Do you think caring about winning is the differentiator?
[55:44.090 --> 55:47.370]  Because if that's the case, I promise you I care more about winning
[55:47.370 --> 55:48.490]  than all of you put together.
[55:48.630 --> 55:49.130]  Oh, I don't know.
[55:49.450 --> 55:52.250]  Yeah, but yeah, but at some point there's a skill gap.
[55:52.410 --> 55:52.850]  You know what I mean?
[55:52.850 --> 55:56.650]  Yeah, that's that is all I'll say is I hit badminton like I hit dingers.
[55:57.930 --> 56:00.530]  You know what? That is a great point by you.
[56:00.610 --> 56:03.090]  I greatly underestimated your your hitting ability.
[56:03.530 --> 56:04.190]  That's great, man.
[56:04.290 --> 56:07.350]  I guess if we're playing badminton for distance, you're going to be crushing it.
[56:07.830 --> 56:08.850]  Ha ha ha.
[56:09.270 --> 56:12.370]  And listen, I was hitting home runs because that's what the job was to do.
[56:12.430 --> 56:16.510]  If you wanted me to hit line across the first place, I've done that.
[56:18.730 --> 56:19.910]  I'm not all power.
[56:20.090 --> 56:24.210]  I'm just imagining Geoff is like a tennis guy who only goes for aces
[56:24.210 --> 56:29.090]  like full power every serve, but isn't it accurate enough to do that?
[56:29.590 --> 56:30.330]  Oh, man.
[56:31.710 --> 56:33.690]  I'm bummed that we're not going to record next week.
[56:34.130 --> 56:36.630]  Yeah. Oh, Geoff won't.
[56:36.730 --> 56:37.650]  We'll be recording stuff.
[56:38.050 --> 56:39.730]  Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:39.790 --> 56:41.930]  But, you know, Geoff, not being here.
[56:42.550 --> 56:43.450]  Yeah, I don't know.
[56:43.470 --> 56:44.670]  I don't know if you guys feel this way.
[56:44.710 --> 56:46.710]  I feel like Geoff is pretty crucial to what we're doing.
[56:46.710 --> 56:47.710]  But, you know.
[56:48.610 --> 56:49.170]  That's definitely.
[56:49.590 --> 56:51.650]  Oh, absolutely. I'm just saying we're going to record.
[56:51.790 --> 56:53.630]  It's not like Gavin was pretty silent when I said that.
[56:53.690 --> 56:54.290]  That's all I'm saying.
[56:54.490 --> 56:55.030]  I agree.
[56:55.530 --> 56:59.170]  I appreciate the partial gas up from from Andrew and Eric.
[56:59.230 --> 57:01.410]  Thank you. I feel I feel loved and important.
[57:01.410 --> 57:04.870]  And also bad that I'm denying you me for a week.
[57:07.430 --> 57:09.510]  I didn't say that's the thing I was missing.
[57:09.630 --> 57:13.130]  That's what that's what I got out of it, essentially, is that you're missing
[57:13.570 --> 57:14.810]  the gift of Geoff for a week.
[57:14.990 --> 57:16.390]  I feel bad about that.
[57:16.990 --> 57:19.950]  If you want, I can call throughout the week periodically.
[57:21.090 --> 57:23.310]  I have a lawn question.
[57:25.310 --> 57:27.790]  Why did all my clippings rot?
[57:28.710 --> 57:31.750]  Uh. Why did dead grass rot?
[57:32.170 --> 57:34.130]  It went a white and fluffy like mold.
[57:34.850 --> 57:35.890]  Probably molded.
[57:36.530 --> 57:38.590]  Wait, what? It went white?
[57:39.070 --> 57:41.050]  Yeah, it went a white and fluffy.
[57:42.390 --> 57:43.630]  It disturbed me.
[57:43.770 --> 57:46.990]  And then I was worried that when I put more grass on top in the bin,
[57:47.110 --> 57:50.210]  that it would blow up all the spores of weird shit in my face.
[57:51.290 --> 57:53.230]  Are you scared of becoming a clicker?
[57:53.990 --> 57:56.950]  Yeah, why are we worried about spores?
[57:58.310 --> 58:00.230]  I've just never seen plants go moldy.
[58:00.850 --> 58:03.550]  Well, I mean, it's 100 degrees outside
[58:03.550 --> 58:06.770]  and all the grass is probably wet when you cut it.
[58:06.910 --> 58:07.910]  So it's all damp.
[58:07.950 --> 58:08.950]  It's got to be mildewed, right?
[58:09.290 --> 58:10.710]  It's just mildewing.
[58:10.830 --> 58:13.910]  And then you stick it in a in a hot box and put a lid on it.
[58:13.970 --> 58:16.170]  It doesn't have anywhere for the moisture to escape.
[58:16.190 --> 58:18.850]  And then you don't put it out for anyone to take away.
[58:19.370 --> 58:21.010]  Yeah, you leave it for a whole extra week.
[58:21.350 --> 58:21.770]  So, yeah.
[58:22.310 --> 58:25.410]  Do you think it's going to kill me, though, or am I safe to live near it?
[58:25.670 --> 58:26.410]  Can I be honest with you?
[58:26.410 --> 58:27.490]  I think it's probably too late.
[58:29.230 --> 58:31.590]  Yeah, you didn't happen to shave near it, did you?
[58:32.170 --> 58:34.810]  I wish to God you'd asked this question yesterday.
[58:37.770 --> 58:41.850]  Is it next to the wall mushroom or is it in a different area?
[58:43.130 --> 58:44.390]  The slime, you mean?
[58:44.450 --> 58:45.270]  Yeah, whatever.
[58:45.410 --> 58:46.910]  You know, your house is fucked.
[58:50.410 --> 58:51.110]  It's true.
[58:51.250 --> 58:53.050]  We found out about we found out about this.
[58:53.610 --> 58:57.090]  We found out about his wall hung TV that he can't move.
[58:57.210 --> 58:59.730]  And there's all it's yeah, there's like a lot going on.
[58:59.790 --> 59:04.450]  That's the guy told him if he moves his wall mounted TV, it'll fall off the wall.
[59:05.110 --> 59:06.150]  Yeah, it's not.
[59:06.710 --> 59:08.610]  Nothing's great, but I'm making do.
[59:08.730 --> 59:11.450]  All right. I'm so fucking glad I don't own a house anymore.
[59:14.250 --> 59:18.350]  Oh, man, this must have been what it was like for you all for the first
[59:18.350 --> 59:19.490]  like two years of the podcast.
[59:20.150 --> 59:22.310]  Yeah. Oh, well, I was trying to get shelves installed.
[59:22.310 --> 59:25.030]  You know what else is a great what? Horizon.
[59:25.850 --> 59:27.570]  Horizon, a Wild West story.
[59:28.610 --> 59:29.990]  Quiet Place, day one, killing it.
[59:30.290 --> 59:31.250]  It's going to have a big week.
[59:31.850 --> 59:34.410]  50 million 800 K.
[59:34.770 --> 59:37.990]  Oh, no, that's almost a million dollars.
[59:38.230 --> 59:40.490]  It's close. Oh, cool, buddy.
[59:40.950 --> 59:42.370]  You had a million dollars right now.
[59:42.450 --> 59:45.270]  If somebody gave you $800,000 right now, you'd be so fucking blown away.
[59:45.350 --> 59:45.890]  Yeah, I agree.
[59:45.950 --> 59:48.990]  And if I was Kevin Costner and doing that, I'd be real bummed out.
[59:49.310 --> 59:51.590]  I don't think I think $800,000, $800,000.
[59:51.590 --> 59:54.870]  Now they they bring up that it's not like the audience for that
[59:54.870 --> 59:57.750]  is going to the Thursday night showings by large.
[59:57.910 --> 01:00:01.850]  Yeah, I would love to know who like who is the hardcore, the hardcore
[01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:05.130]  that has to go to the fucking midnight premiere of Horizon.
[01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:10.310]  Everybody knows you want to cowboys go to bed when the sun goes down.
[01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:14.950]  I keep wanting to call it Forbidden West, but that's the the other.
[01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.850]  That's the sequel to the Met game.
[01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.710]  But I just feel like it fits that story.
[01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:23.150]  What is it called? Horizon, a Western tale?
[01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:25.510]  What is it? Horizon Forbidden West.
[01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:27.410]  Is that a Met game? I just installed it.
[01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:29.150]  That is what's going to happen.
[01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:31.150]  People are going to be like an American saga.
[01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.330]  They'll be like, oh, I should see that.
[01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:37.430]  And they won't get around to it until they accidentally see part two.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.990]  And then then it will add to my total.
[01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:45.490]  Oh, oh, this is a there's something in the article there.
[01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:48.770]  I just put it in their critical reviews for Horizon.
[01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:53.250]  Stand at 41 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, which isn't as bad as Costner's
[01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:58.670]  The Postman at 14 percent, though it is below the Waterworld's 47 percent.
[01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:02.010]  Are you telling me that this movie is essentially as good as Waterworld?
[01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:05.970]  Shutching! We've got ourselves a barn burner.
[01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:07.870]  It's going to build all summer long.
[01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.710]  Titanic 2.0. Here we go.
[01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:11.290]  I'm fucking pumped.
[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:16.170]  I cannot wait for the Horizon ride to continue on for many years.
[01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:22.010]  It'll just be like Westworld.
[01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:26.850]  It'll it'll just be people killing Indians and it is the Wild West.
[01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:29.370]  Do we have a running total to read out or anything?
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:31.590]  I could I could pull it up.
[01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:34.030]  What everyone's that quick that people appreciate.
[01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.170]  I do. I got I got an update of the running.
[01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:37.950]  Gavin is crushing it right now.
[01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:41.910]  Unfortunately, Gavin currently at five hundred fifty four million dollars.
[01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:45.330]  Geoff has one hundred twenty three million.
[01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:49.250]  Second, Eric has one hundred eight million and third.
[01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.310]  I have one hundred five million and four.
[01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:53.590]  So we're all kind of close.
[01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:57.390]  And then Nick currently with 13 million in fifth place.
[01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.670]  He's going to catch up hard and fast.
[01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:02.170]  He's got that despicable me coming.
[01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.010]  Yeah, he's got minions or whatever.
[01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.170]  Like it's about to go crazy.
[01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.790]  Blue log episode Nagi releases today for Nick.
[01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.790]  So that's that's going to be big draw.
[01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.670]  All right. Count those dollars, baby.
[01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.090]  I bet it does better than Horizon.
[01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:18.850]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:22.850]  Is it just me or are you guys getting ads for fly me to the moon?
[01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.690]  That Scarlett Johansson, Shining Tana movie?
[01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:26.150]  I'm getting all the time.
[01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:28.390]  So many ads for it.
[01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:29.910]  I'm glad it's not just me.
[01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:31.110]  It I feel it is.
[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.970]  It looks like a fake movie that 30 Rock made.
[01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:35.750]  It does not look like a real film.
[01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:37.150]  I can't believe I have it.
[01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:41.350]  And I don't like I felt like it would be a small like romantic comedy,
[01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:45.770]  But they are pushing it like a summer blockbuster in a way that I think is odd.
[01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:49.410]  So I just wanted to make sure that I somehow didn't fuck my algorithm
[01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:51.210]  because I own it and have looked into it.
[01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:52.890]  I'm glad you're also in the same boat, Eric.
[01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:53.910]  You own it? Yeah.
[01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:57.450]  I do. Yeah, I bought it for a whole four points.
[01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:02.010]  Oh, I've been trying to figure out a way to iterate on this idea
[01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:03.970]  and so that we can do it again.
[01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.610]  And a lot of people have been submitting ideas to us.
[01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.030]  And I've seen a bunch of it.
[01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:09.730]  Andrew's got a whole list.
[01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:11.970]  But I did land on something.
[01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:15.330]  We've been talking about wanting to do something with the Olympics, right?
[01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:18.470]  And we had talked about maybe like throwing all the countries
[01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:23.030]  except for our countries into a like a bingo thing and pulling out
[01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.190]  and then like three each.
[01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:25.830]  And those are the countries we support.
[01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.910]  And then I don't know, maybe rooting for them on a live stream or something.
[01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:32.430]  But I was thinking about how countries collect medals.
[01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.610]  And there's like the medal race, you know, at the end of the day.
[01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:39.270]  It would be interesting if we collected or we did something like that.
[01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:43.330]  But then the goal was to see how many medals the countries we collected
[01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:45.490]  or we we picked got.
[01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.030]  And then if we could use that currency down the road in some way, that made sense.
[01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:49.430]  That's fun.
[01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:52.110]  Yeah, I did that sort of with the last Olympics, right?
[01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:55.770]  I bet the over on every single country's Olympic medal count.
[01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:59.550]  And I think I came out like positive 50 cents.
[01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.570]  I made equal bets across each for like a dollar.
[01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:07.190]  Really? There's one country that was not expected to win, too.
[01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.950]  It was one and a half was the line.
[01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:12.870]  And I got it because they shockingly won like some swimming thing
[01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:15.210]  when they're only expected to win a medal in boxing.
[01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:16.910]  But yeah, that's fun.
[01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:18.010]  Oh, we'll figure something out.
[01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:20.290]  Just it would be funny if one day we were just like six months from now.
[01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:20.970]  You're like, you know what?
[01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.310]  Actually, we are going to do that.
[01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:25.670]  And I'm going to spend my I'm going to spend three Chinese gold medals on it.
[01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.890]  And somebody everybody's like, I forgot you had those.
[01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:28.570]  We can't say no.
[01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:32.210]  You know, it's got to be a better way to kind of phrase any of that.
[01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:33.170]  That's really good.
[01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:37.250]  I mean, China is a country you don't get a lot.
[01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.590]  They get a lot of medals.
[01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:40.070]  Just feels like a weird thing.
[01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.010]  I just the way you said it just feels weird to me.
[01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:42.690]  That's all. That's all.
[01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:43.550]  All right. I did.
[01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:46.970]  We I'm going to spend three Italian gold medals on it.
[01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:52.310]  Whoa. They spent they spent the same as Chinese gold medals.
[01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:54.170]  But for some reason, they they're different to Eric.
[01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.810]  Mama mia.
[01:04:56.990 --> 01:05:00.930]  I like having seasons with these type of things.
[01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:04.890]  So I was thinking like when the movie season ends, that's when NFL season begins
[01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:09.850]  and doing something where like we have a kicker draft because Gavin loves football,
[01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:10.970]  which is a foot sport.
[01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:16.310]  If we do like an auction of kickers and your goal is to have the most or least
[01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.930]  field goals, I haven't decided which. Oh, better.
[01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:22.610]  But like we just run through every kicker and we have to bet on them.
[01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:26.390]  Like we're heavily, heavily invested in the NFL season,
[01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:29.370]  but only from the standpoint, only the kickers.
[01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:31.530]  Yeah, as Gavin likes, I love it.
[01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:33.630]  Love that idea. Yeah.
[01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:35.330]  I have. How do you pick them?
[01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:40.010]  I would spend two silver and a gold medal from a country of your choice to approve that.
[01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:42.110]  That's good. That's good.
[01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.150]  See, see, you say it like that and it's fine.
[01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:49.070]  I just if you say like I'm spending three Polish gold medals, it just I'm telling you,
[01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:51.330]  it sounds it's not good. It just sounds weird.
[01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:52.950]  That's all. But it isn't actually.
[01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.770]  Weird, I understand.
[01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:59.210]  I'm just I'm trying to get the optics so that way you're aware.
[01:05:59.370 --> 01:05:59.830]  That's all.
[01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:03.010]  I think we also could use it for sloppy, just bingo.
[01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.210]  I thought would be fun.
[01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:04.990]  Wow.
[01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.610]  Lay out all these. I love that.
[01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.270]  You get to buy your bingo card.
[01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:09.350]  Mm hmm.
[01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:11.090]  It's like a taxi.
[01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:14.590]  Go for like 70 points because it's more probable.
[01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:17.550]  Although those aren't those haven't been around as much recently.
[01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:19.870]  I'm not putting anything in a wheelchair.
[01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.950]  Tell you that fucking much.
[01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.830]  Anyway, we should wrap up.
[01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.890]  We should we should wrap up.
[01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:26.690]  We should also plan a sloppy does bingo soon.
[01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:28.430]  We should seem to do one of those.
[01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:30.430]  Let's do let's do one soon.
[01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:31.610]  Yeah, yeah. I think this is good.
[01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:32.390]  We'll get it on the calendar.
[01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:35.610]  All right, well, I guess that'll do it then.
[01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.690]  Rare Friday recording.
[01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:38.910]  How did I feel about this one?
[01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:40.270]  I liked it.
[01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:41.310]  I think it would.
[01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:42.410]  One of my favorites.
[01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.670]  One of your favorite.
[01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:44.950]  I was going to say
[01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:48.030]  kind of I kind of like the energy level of it.
[01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:49.010]  Just kind of like chill.
[01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:50.490]  It was a chill episode, I feel like.
[01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:54.510]  I don't I don't know if that's how I'd phrase it, but I love that's how I felt.
[01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:57.050]  Oh, I had one minor outburst
[01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.550]  because I was mad about the post office.
[01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:02.190]  But other than that, I think it started pretty high octane.
[01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:03.870]  And then I got really tired from laughing.
[01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:05.150]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:10.190]  Ended on a ended on a chill note.
[01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:11.090]  Yeah, that's nice.
[01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:14.750]  Speaking of ending your time listening to this podcast
[01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:17.610]  has come to a close, at least this episode.
[01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:20.070]  Now, that doesn't mean you can't listen to any more.
[01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.850]  We've got hundreds of back episodes from a previous podcast
[01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:26.930]  we did before our company was shut down out from under us.
[01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:32.050]  And we were, uh, you know, allowed and and supported and encouraged
[01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:34.250]  to start anew, which is what we've done.
[01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.650]  And we would like you to continue the journey with us
[01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:39.690]  by going to our website that Gavin loves to say.
[01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:42.390]  Regulatrion dot com.
[01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:45.150]  You were, by the way, Gav, right on top of that.
[01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.570]  Thank you so much. You really thought you were going to say it.
[01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:51.230]  Why would I say I why would he set you up?
[01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:53.090]  Why would I set you?
[01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:55.790]  We'll see you next time.
[01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:58.870]  I can actually buy singular nails.
[01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:00.030]  That's awesome.
[01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:01.330]  How much is one nail?
[01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:03.050]  Fifty three cents.
[01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:05.690]  It's it's the cost of highway robbery.
[01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:06.870]  You're getting ripped off.
[01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:10.450]  But it's for six inch, eight inch, a dollar five.
[01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:11.310]  I don't think I need it.
[01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:13.150]  Oh, do I need an eight inch?
[01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:14.890]  You do not need an eight inch nail.
[01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:18.250]  I think you got to get that six extra inches.
[01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:19.650]  Plus, you're buying a two by four.
[01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:20.710]  And I got news for you.
[01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:22.170]  A two by four isn't two by four.
[01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:24.010]  It's one and a half by three and a half.
[01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.250]  So you really don't need that much.
[01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:28.310]  I'm going to buy three nails.
[01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:29.610]  Awesome.
[01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.870]  All right.
[01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:32.350]  We'll see you next time. Bye bye.
